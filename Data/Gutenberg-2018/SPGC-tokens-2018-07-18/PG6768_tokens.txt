agravaine
the
and
the

in

the
man
upstairs
there
were
three
distinct
stages
in
the
evolution
of
annette
attitude
towards
the
knocking
in
the
room
above
in
the
beginning
it
had
been
merely
a
vague
discomfort
absorbed
in
the
composition
of
her
waltz
she
had
heard
it
almost
subconsciously
the
second
stage
set
in
when
it
became
a
physical
pain
like
pincers
wrenching
her
mind
from
her
music
finally
with
a
thrill
in
indignation
she
knew
it
for
what
it
was
an
insult
the
unseen
brute
disliked
her
playing
and
was
intimating
his
views
with
a
defiantly
with
her
foot
on
the
loud
pedal
she
struck
almost
slapped
the
keys
once
more
from
the
room
above
bang
annette
rose
her
face
was
pink
her
chin
tilted
her
eyes
sparkled
with
the
light
of
battle
she
left
the
room
and
started
to
mount
the
stairs
no
spectator
however
just
could
have
helped
feeling
a
pang
of
pity
for
the
wretched
man
who
stood
unconscious
of
imminent
doom
possibly
even
triumphant
behind
the
door
at
which
she
was
on
the
point
of
tapping
in
cried
the
voice
rather
a
pleasant
voice
but
what
is
a
pleasant
voice
if
the
soul
be
vile
annette
went
in
the
room
was
a
typical
chelsea
studio
scantily
furnished
and
lacking
a
carpet
in
the
centre
was
an
easel
behind
which
were
visible
a
pair
of
trousered
legs
a
cloud
of
grey
smoke
was
curling
up
over
the
top
of
the
easel
beg
your
pardon
began
annette
do
want
any
models
at
present
said
the
brute
your
card
on
the
table
am
not
a
model
said
annette
coldly
merely
came
at
this
the
brute
emerged
from
his
fortifications
and
removing
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
jerked
his
chair
out
into
the
open
beg
your
pardon
he
said
you
sit
down
how
reckless
is
nature
in
the
distribution
of
her
gifts
not
only
had
this
knocker
on
floors
a
pleasant
voice
but
in
addition
a
pleasing
exterior
he
was
slightly
dishevelled
at
the
moment
and
his
hair
stood
up
in
a
disordered
mop
but
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
he
was
quite
passably
annette
admitted
this
though
wrathful
she
was
fair
thought
it
was
another
model
he
explained
been
coming
in
at
the
rate
of
ten
an
hour
ever
since
i
settled
here
i
did
object
at
first
but
after
about
the
eightieth
child
of
sunny
italy
had
shown
up
it
began
to
get
on
my
nerves
annette
waited
coldly
till
he
had
finished
am
sorry
she
said
in
a
voice
my
playing
disturbed
you
one
would
have
thought
nobody
but
an
eskimo
wearing
his
furs
and
winter
could
have
withstood
the
iciness
of
her
manner
but
the
brute
did
not
freeze
am
sorry
repeated
annette
well
below
zero
my
playing
disturbed
you
i
live
in
the
room
below
and
i
heard
you
knocking
no
protested
the
young
man
affably
like
it
really
i
do
why
knock
on
the
floor
said
annette
turning
to
go
is
so
bad
for
my
ceiling
she
said
over
shoulder
thought
you
would
not
mind
my
mentioning
it
good
afternoon
but
one
moment
do
go
she
stopped
he
was
surveying
her
with
a
friendly
smile
she
noticed
most
reluctantly
that
he
had
a
nice
smile
his
composure
began
to
enrage
her
more
and
more
long
ere
this
he
should
have
been
writhing
at
her
feet
in
the
dust
crushed
and
abject
see
he
said
awfully
sorry
but
it
like
this
i
love
music
but
what
i
mean
is
you
were
playing
a
it
was
just
the
same
bit
over
and
over
again
was
trying
to
get
a
phrase
said
annette
with
dignity
but
less
coldly
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
beginning
to
thaw
there
was
something
singularly
attractive
about
this
youth
phrase
music
for
my
waltz
i
am
composing
a
waltz
a
look
of
such
unqualified
admiration
overspread
the
young
man
face
that
the
last
remnants
of
the
melted
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
met
annette
found
herself
positively
liking
this
blackguardly
you
compose
music
he
said
impressed
have
written
one
or
two
songs
must
be
great
to
be
able
to
do
things
artistic
things
i
mean
like
composing
you
do
do
you
you
paint
the
young
man
shook
his
head
with
a
cheerful
grin
fancy
he
said
should
make
a
pretty
good
i
want
scope
canvas
seems
to
cramp
me
it
seemed
to
cause
him
no
discomfort
he
appeared
rather
amused
than
otherwise
me
look
she
crossed
over
to
the
easel
should
he
warned
her
really
want
to
is
this
not
mere
recklessness
very
well
then
to
the
eye
of
an
experienced
critic
the
picture
would
certainly
have
seemed
crude
it
was
a
study
of
a
child
holding
a
large
black
cat
statisticians
estimate
that
there
is
no
moment
during
the
day
when
one
or
more
young
artists
somewhere
on
the
face
of
the
globe
are
not
painting
pictures
of
children
holding
cats
call
it
child
and
cat
said
the
young
man
a
neat
title
do
you
think
gives
you
the
main
idea
of
the
thing
right
away
that
he
explained
pointing
obligingly
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
the
cat
annette
belonged
to
that
large
section
of
the
public
which
likes
or
dislikes
a
picture
according
to
whether
its
subject
happens
to
please
or
displease
them
probably
there
was
not
one
of
the
million
or
so
eyesores
at
present
in
existence
which
she
would
not
have
liked
besides
he
had
been
very
nice
about
her
music
think
it
splendid
she
announced
the
young
man
face
displayed
almost
more
surprise
than
joy
you
really
he
said
i
can
die
happy
that
is
if
you
let
me
come
down
and
listen
to
those
songs
of
yours
first
would
only
knock
on
the
floor
objected
annette
never
knock
on
another
floor
as
long
as
i
live
said
the
reassuringly
hate
knocking
on
floors
i
do
see
what
people
want
to
knock
on
floors
anyway
friendships
ripen
quickly
in
chelsea
within
the
space
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
annette
had
learned
that
the
young
man
name
was
alan
beverley
for
which
family
heraldic
affliction
she
pitied
rather
than
despised
him
that
he
did
not
depend
entirely
on
his
work
for
a
living
having
a
little
money
of
his
own
and
that
he
considered
this
a
fortunate
thing
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
talk
he
pleased
her
she
found
him
an
absolutely
new
and
original
variety
of
the
unsuccessful
painter
unlike
reginald
sellers
who
had
a
studio
in
the
same
building
and
sometimes
dropped
in
to
drink
her
coffee
and
pour
out
his
troubles
he
did
not
attribute
his
to
any
malice
or
stupidity
on
the
part
of
the
public
she
was
so
used
to
hearing
sellers
lash
the
philistine
and
hold
forth
on
unappreciated
merit
that
she
could
hardly
believe
the
miracle
when
in
answer
to
a
sympathetic
bromide
on
the
popular
lack
of
taste
in
art
beverley
replied
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
public
showed
strong
good
sense
if
he
had
been
striving
with
every
nerve
to
win
her
esteem
he
could
not
have
done
it
more
surely
than
with
that
one
remark
though
she
invariably
listened
with
a
sweet
patience
which
encouraged
them
to
continue
long
after
the
point
at
which
she
had
begun
in
spirit
to
throw
things
at
them
annette
had
no
sympathy
with
men
who
whined
she
herself
was
a
fighter
she
hated
as
much
as
anyone
the
sickening
blows
which
fate
hands
out
to
the
struggling
and
ambitious
but
she
never
made
them
the
basis
of
a
monologue
act
often
after
a
dreary
trip
round
the
offices
of
the
she
would
howl
bitterly
in
secret
and
even
gnaw
her
pillow
in
the
watches
of
the
night
but
in
public
her
pride
kept
her
unvaryingly
bright
and
cheerful
today
for
the
first
time
she
revealed
something
of
her
woes
there
was
that
about
the
young
man
which
invited
confidences
she
told
him
of
the
of
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
songs
printed
unless
you
paid
for
them
of
their
wretched
sales
those
songs
you
been
playing
said
beverley
been
published
those
three
but
they
are
the
only
ones
did
they
sell
at
all
you
see
a
song
does
sell
unless
somebody
well
known
sings
it
and
people
promise
to
sing
them
and
then
do
keep
their
word
you
ca
depend
on
what
they
say
me
their
names
said
beverley
i
go
round
tomorrow
and
shoot
the
whole
lot
but
ca
you
do
anything
keep
on
keeping
on
wish
he
said
any
time
you
feeling
blue
about
things
you
would
come
up
and
pour
out
the
poison
on
me
it
no
good
bottling
it
up
come
up
and
tell
me
about
it
and
you
feel
ever
so
much
better
or
let
me
come
down
any
time
things
are
going
right
just
knock
on
the
ceiling
she
laughed
rub
it
in
pleaded
beverley
is
fair
there
nobody
so
sensitive
as
a
reformed
you
will
come
up
or
let
me
come
down
wo
you
whenever
i
have
that
sad
depressed
feeling
i
go
out
and
kill
a
policeman
but
you
would
care
for
that
so
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
knock
on
the
ceiling
then
i
come
charging
down
and
see
if
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
be
sorry
you
ever
said
this
wo
he
said
stoutly
you
really
mean
it
it
be
a
relief
she
admitted
i
give
all
the
money
i
ever
likely
to
make
for
someone
to
shriek
my
grievances
at
i
always
think
it
must
have
been
so
nice
for
the
people
in
the
old
novels
when
they
used
to
say
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
must
it
have
been
heavenly
said
beverley
rising
know
where
i
am
if
i
wanted
right
up
there
where
the
knocking
came
from
said
annette
remember
no
knocking
you
mind
shaking
hands
said
beverley
a
particularly
maddening
hour
with
one
of
her
pupils
drove
her
up
the
very
next
day
her
pupils
were
at
once
her
salvation
and
her
despair
they
gave
her
the
means
of
supporting
life
but
they
made
life
hardly
worth
supporting
some
of
them
were
learning
the
piano
others
thought
they
sang
all
had
solid
ivory
skulls
there
was
about
a
teaspoonful
of
grey
matter
distributed
among
the
entire
squad
and
the
pupil
annette
had
been
teaching
that
afternoon
had
come
in
at
the
of
the
division
in
the
studio
with
beverley
she
found
reginald
sellers
standing
in
a
critical
attitude
before
the
easel
she
was
not
very
fond
of
him
he
was
a
long
offensive
patronizing
person
with
a
moustache
that
looked
like
a
smear
of
charcoal
and
a
habit
of
addressing
her
as
little
one
beverley
looked
up
you
brought
your
hatchet
miss
brougham
if
you
have
you
just
in
time
to
join
in
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
sellers
has
been
smiting
my
child
and
cat
hip
and
thigh
look
at
his
eye
there
did
you
see
it
flash
then
he
on
the
warpath
again
dear
beverley
said
sellers
rather
stiffly
am
merely
endeavouring
to
give
you
my
idea
of
the
picture
defects
i
am
sorry
if
my
criticism
has
to
be
a
little
harsh
right
on
said
beverley
cordially
mind
me
it
all
for
my
good
in
a
word
then
it
is
lifeless
neither
the
child
nor
the
cat
lives
he
stepped
back
a
pace
and
made
a
frame
of
his
hands
cat
now
he
said
is
how
shall
i
put
it
it
has
no
no
er
kind
of
cat
would
said
beverley
is
that
breed
think
it
a
dear
cat
said
annette
she
felt
her
temper
always
quick
getting
the
better
of
her
she
knew
just
how
incompetent
sellers
was
and
it
irritated
her
beyond
endurance
to
see
acceptance
of
his
patronage
any
rate
said
beverley
with
a
grin
both
seem
to
recognize
that
it
is
a
cat
you
solid
on
that
point
and
that
something
seeing
i
only
a
beginner
know
my
dear
fellow
i
know
said
sellers
graciously
must
let
my
criticism
discourage
you
do
think
that
your
work
lacks
promise
far
from
it
i
am
sure
that
in
time
you
will
do
very
well
indeed
quite
well
a
cold
glitter
might
have
been
observed
in
annette
eyes
sellers
she
said
smoothly
to
work
very
hard
himself
before
he
reached
his
present
position
you
know
his
work
of
course
for
the
first
time
beverley
seemed
somewhat
confused
er
why
he
began
but
of
course
you
do
she
went
on
sweetly
in
all
the
magazines
beverley
looked
at
the
great
man
with
admiration
and
saw
that
he
had
flushed
uncomfortably
he
put
this
down
to
the
modesty
of
genius
the
advertisement
pages
said
annette
sellers
drew
that
picture
of
the
waukeesy
shoe
and
the
restawhile
settee
and
the
tin
of
sardines
in
the
little
gem
sardine
advertisement
he
is
very
good
at
still
life
there
was
a
tense
silence
beverley
could
almost
hear
the
voice
of
the
referee
uttering
the
count
brougham
said
sellers
at
last
spitting
out
the
words
confined
herself
to
the
purely
commercial
side
of
my
work
there
is
another
of
course
there
is
you
sold
a
landscape
for
five
pounds
only
eight
months
ago
did
you
and
another
three
months
before
that
it
was
enough
sellers
bowed
stiffly
and
stalked
from
the
room
beverley
picked
up
a
duster
and
began
slowly
to
sweep
the
floor
with
it
are
you
doing
demanded
annette
in
a
choking
voice
fragments
of
the
wretched
man
whispered
beverley
must
be
swept
up
and
decently
interred
you
certainly
have
got
the
punch
miss
brougham
he
dropped
the
duster
with
a
startled
exclamation
for
annette
had
suddenly
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
sat
in
her
chair
and
sobbed
desperately
lord
said
beverley
blankly
a
cat
i
a
beast
i
hate
myself
lord
said
beverley
blankly
a
pig
i
a
fiend
lord
said
beverley
blankly
all
struggling
and
trying
to
get
on
and
having
hard
luck
and
instead
of
doing
what
i
can
to
help
i
go
and
him
with
not
being
able
to
sell
his
pictures
i
not
fit
to
live
lord
said
beverley
blankly
a
series
of
gulping
sobs
followed
diminishing
by
degrees
into
silence
presently
she
looked
up
and
smiled
a
moist
and
pathetic
smile
sorry
she
said
being
so
stupid
but
he
was
so
horrid
and
patronizing
to
you
i
could
help
scratching
i
believe
i
the
worst
cat
in
london
this
is
said
beverley
pointing
to
the
canvas
least
according
to
the
late
sellers
but
i
say
tell
me
is
the
deceased
a
great
artist
then
he
came
curveting
in
here
with
his
chest
out
and
started
to
slate
my
masterpiece
so
i
naturally
said
is
a
genius
is
he
ca
sell
his
pictures
anywhere
he
lives
on
the
little
he
can
get
from
illustrating
advertisements
and
i
said
beverley
apprehensively
she
recovered
herself
with
a
gulp
ca
help
it
she
said
miserably
rubbed
it
in
oh
it
was
hateful
of
me
but
i
was
all
on
edge
from
teaching
one
of
my
awful
pupils
and
when
he
started
to
patronize
you
she
blinked
devil
said
beverley
never
guessed
good
lord
annette
rose
must
go
and
tell
him
i
sorry
she
said
snub
me
horribly
but
i
must
she
went
out
beverley
lit
a
pipe
and
stood
at
the
window
looking
thoughtfully
down
into
the
street
it
is
a
good
rule
in
life
never
to
apologize
the
right
sort
of
people
do
not
want
apologies
and
the
wrong
sort
take
a
mean
advantage
of
them
sellers
belonged
to
the
latter
class
when
annette
meek
penitent
with
all
her
claws
sheathed
came
to
him
and
grovelled
he
forgave
her
with
a
repulsive
magnanimity
which
in
a
less
subdued
mood
would
have
stung
her
to
renewed
pugnacity
as
it
was
she
allowed
herself
to
be
forgiven
and
retired
with
a
dismal
conviction
that
from
now
on
he
would
be
more
insufferable
than
ever
her
surmise
proved
absolutely
correct
his
visits
to
the
studio
began
again
and
beverley
picture
now
nearing
completion
came
in
for
criticism
enough
to
have
filled
a
volume
the
good
humour
with
which
he
received
it
amazed
annette
she
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
painting
beyond
what
she
acquired
from
a
growing
regard
for
its
parent
which
disturbed
her
a
good
deal
when
she
had
time
to
think
of
it
but
there
were
moments
when
only
the
recollection
of
her
remorse
for
her
previous
outbreak
kept
her
from
rending
the
critic
beverley
however
appeared
to
have
no
artistic
sensitiveness
whatsoever
when
sellers
savaged
the
cat
in
a
manner
which
should
have
brought
the
down
upon
him
beverley
merely
beamed
his
was
beyond
annette
comprehension
she
began
to
admire
him
for
it
to
make
his
position
as
critic
still
more
impregnable
sellers
was
now
able
to
speak
as
one
having
authority
after
years
of
floundering
his
luck
seemed
at
last
to
have
turned
his
pictures
which
for
months
had
lain
at
an
agent
careened
like
crippled
battleships
had
at
length
begun
to
find
a
market
within
the
past
two
weeks
three
landscapes
and
an
allegorical
painting
had
sold
for
good
prices
and
under
the
influence
of
success
he
expanded
like
an
opening
floweret
when
epstein
the
agent
wrote
to
say
that
the
allegory
had
been
purchased
by
a
glasgow
plutocrat
of
the
name
of
bates
for
one
hundred
and
sixty
guineas
sellers
views
on
philistines
and
their
crass
materialism
and
lack
of
taste
underwent
a
marked
modification
he
spoke
with
some
friendliness
of
the
man
bates
me
said
beverley
when
informed
of
the
event
by
annette
matter
has
a
deeper
significance
it
proves
that
glasgow
has
at
last
produced
a
sober
man
no
drinker
would
have
dared
face
that
allegory
the
whole
business
is
very
gratifying
beverley
himself
was
progressing
slowly
in
the
field
of
art
he
had
finished
the
and
cat
and
had
taken
it
to
epstein
together
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
sellers
sellers
habitual
attitude
now
was
that
of
the
kindly
celebrity
who
has
arrived
and
wishes
to
give
the
youngsters
a
chance
since
its
departure
beverley
had
not
done
much
in
the
way
of
actual
execution
whenever
annette
came
to
his
studio
he
was
either
sitting
in
a
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
smoking
or
in
the
same
attitude
listening
to
sellers
views
on
art
sellers
being
on
the
upgrade
a
man
with
many
pounds
to
his
credit
in
the
bank
had
more
leisure
now
he
had
given
up
his
advertisement
work
and
was
planning
a
great
canvas
another
allegorical
work
this
left
him
free
to
devote
a
good
deal
of
time
to
beverley
and
he
did
so
beverley
sat
and
smoked
through
his
harangues
he
may
have
been
listening
or
he
may
not
annette
listened
once
or
twice
and
the
experience
had
the
effect
of
sending
her
to
beverley
quivering
with
indignation
do
you
him
patronize
you
like
that
she
demanded
anybody
came
and
talked
to
me
like
that
about
my
music
i
i
i
do
know
what
i
do
yes
even
if
he
were
really
a
great
musician
you
consider
sellers
a
great
artist
then
even
now
seems
to
be
able
to
sell
his
pictures
so
i
suppose
they
must
be
good
but
nothing
could
give
him
the
right
to
patronize
you
as
he
does
my
learned
friend
manner
would
be
intolerable
in
an
emperor
to
a
quoted
beverley
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
only
you
could
sell
a
picture
too
well
i
done
my
part
of
the
contract
i
delivered
the
goods
there
the
thing
is
at
epstein
the
public
ca
blame
me
if
it
does
sell
all
they
got
to
do
is
to
waltz
in
in
their
thousands
and
fight
for
it
and
by
the
way
talking
of
waltzes
it
finished
said
annette
dispiritedly
too
for
that
matter
what
the
matter
then
why
this
drooping
sadness
why
are
you
running
around
the
square
singing
like
a
bird
said
annette
i
had
to
pay
the
expenses
of
publication
it
was
only
five
pounds
but
the
sales
have
caught
up
with
that
yet
if
they
ever
do
perhaps
there
be
a
new
edition
will
you
have
to
pay
for
that
the
publishers
would
are
they
and
buchterkirch
then
what
are
you
worrying
about
the
thing
a
cert
a
man
with
a
name
like
grusczinsky
could
sell
a
dozen
editions
by
himself
helped
and
inspired
by
buchterkirch
he
will
make
the
waltz
the
talk
of
the
country
infants
will
croon
it
in
their
cots
did
seem
to
think
so
when
i
saw
him
last
course
not
he
does
know
his
own
power
grusczinsky
shrinking
diffidence
is
a
in
musical
circles
he
is
the
genuine
human
violet
you
must
give
him
time
give
him
anything
if
he
only
sell
an
edition
or
two
said
annette
the
outstanding
thing
was
that
he
did
there
seemed
no
particular
reason
why
the
sale
of
that
waltz
should
not
have
been
as
small
and
as
slow
as
that
of
any
other
waltz
by
an
unknown
composer
but
almost
without
warning
it
expanded
from
a
trickle
into
a
flood
grusczinsky
beaming
paternally
whenever
annette
entered
the
shop
which
was
often
announced
two
new
editions
in
a
week
beverley
his
artistic
growth
still
under
a
watchful
eye
of
sellers
said
he
had
never
had
any
doubts
as
to
the
success
of
the
thing
from
the
moment
when
a
single
phrase
in
it
had
so
carried
him
away
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
stamp
his
applause
enthusiastically
on
the
floor
even
sellers
forgot
his
own
triumphs
long
enough
to
allow
him
to
offer
affable
congratulations
and
money
came
rolling
in
smoothing
the
path
of
life
those
were
great
days
there
was
a
hat
life
in
short
was
very
full
and
splendid
there
was
indeed
but
one
thing
which
kept
it
from
being
perfect
the
usual
drawback
to
success
is
that
it
annoys
one
friends
so
but
in
annette
case
this
drawback
was
absent
sellers
demeanour
towards
her
was
that
of
an
inmate
welcoming
a
novice
into
the
hall
of
fame
her
pupils
worthy
souls
though
fawned
upon
her
beverley
seemed
more
pleased
than
anyone
yet
it
was
beverley
who
prevented
her
paradise
from
being
complete
successful
herself
she
wanted
all
her
friends
to
be
successful
but
beverley
to
her
discomfort
remained
a
cheery
failure
and
worse
absolutely
refused
to
snub
sellers
it
was
not
as
if
sellers
advice
and
comments
were
disinterested
beverley
was
simply
the
instrument
on
which
he
played
his
songs
of
triumph
it
distressed
annette
to
such
an
extent
that
now
if
she
went
upstairs
and
heard
sellers
voice
in
the
studio
she
came
down
again
without
knocking
one
afternoon
sitting
in
her
room
she
heard
the
ring
the
telephone
was
on
the
stairs
just
outside
her
door
she
went
out
and
took
up
the
receiver
said
a
querulous
voice
mr
beverley
there
annette
remembered
having
heard
him
go
out
she
could
always
tell
his
footstep
is
out
she
said
there
any
message
said
the
voice
emphatically
him
that
rupert
morrison
rang
up
to
ask
what
he
was
to
do
with
all
this
great
stack
of
music
that
arrived
does
he
want
it
forwarded
on
to
him
or
what
the
voice
was
growing
high
and
excited
evidently
mr
morrison
was
in
a
state
of
nervous
tension
when
a
man
does
not
care
particularly
who
hears
his
troubles
so
long
as
he
unburdens
himself
of
them
to
someone
said
annette
shrilled
mr
morrison
and
stacks
and
stacks
of
it
is
he
playing
a
practical
joke
on
me
or
what
he
demanded
hysterically
plainly
he
had
now
come
to
regard
annette
as
a
legitimate
confidante
she
was
listening
that
was
the
main
point
he
wanted
someone
he
did
not
care
whom
who
would
listen
lends
me
his
rooms
wailed
mr
morrison
that
i
can
be
perfectly
quiet
and
undisturbed
while
i
write
my
novel
and
first
thing
i
know
this
music
starts
to
arrive
how
can
i
be
quiet
and
undisturbed
when
the
floor
littered
two
yards
high
with
great
parcels
of
music
and
more
coming
every
day
annette
clung
weakly
to
the
telephone
box
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
but
she
was
beginning
to
see
many
things
you
there
called
mr
morrison
what
what
firm
does
the
music
come
from
that
are
the
publishers
who
send
the
music
ca
remember
some
long
name
yes
i
got
it
grusczinsky
and
someone
tell
mr
beverley
said
annette
quietly
a
great
weight
seemed
to
have
settled
on
her
head
halloa
are
you
there
came
mr
morrison
voice
tell
him
there
are
some
pictures
too
great
beastly
pictures
the
size
of
elephants
i
tell
you
there
is
room
to
move
and
annette
hung
up
the
receiver
mr
beverley
returned
from
his
walk
was
racing
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
in
his
energetic
way
when
as
he
arrived
at
annette
door
it
opened
you
a
minute
to
spare
said
annette
course
what
the
trouble
have
they
sold
another
edition
of
the
waltz
have
not
heard
mr
bates
for
once
she
looked
to
see
the
cheerful
composure
of
the
man
upstairs
become
ruffled
but
he
received
the
blow
without
agitation
know
my
name
he
said
know
a
good
deal
more
than
your
name
you
are
a
glasgow
millionaire
true
he
admitted
it
hereditary
my
father
was
one
before
me
you
use
your
money
said
annette
bitterly
paradises
for
your
friends
which
last
i
suppose
until
you
grow
tired
of
the
amusement
and
destroy
them
does
it
ever
strike
you
mr
bates
that
it
a
little
cruel
do
you
think
mr
sellers
will
settle
down
again
cheerfully
to
when
you
stop
buying
his
pictures
and
he
finds
out
that
that
sha
stop
said
the
young
man
a
glasgow
millionaire
buy
sellers
allegorical
pictures
whose
allegorical
pictures
may
he
buy
sellers
will
never
find
out
he
go
on
painting
and
i
go
on
buying
and
all
will
be
joy
and
peace
and
what
future
have
you
arranged
for
me
he
said
reflectively
want
to
marry
you
annette
stiffened
from
head
to
foot
he
met
her
blazing
eyes
with
a
look
of
quiet
devotion
me
know
what
you
are
thinking
he
said
mind
is
dwelling
on
the
prospect
of
living
in
a
house
decorated
throughout
with
allegorical
pictures
but
it
wo
be
we
store
them
in
the
attic
she
began
to
speak
but
he
interrupted
her
he
said
down
and
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
we
skip
the
first
years
and
three
months
merely
mentioning
that
for
the
greater
part
of
that
time
i
was
looking
for
somebody
just
like
you
a
month
and
nine
days
ago
i
found
you
you
were
crossing
the
embankment
i
was
also
on
the
embankment
in
a
taxi
i
stopped
the
taxi
got
out
and
observed
you
just
stepping
into
the
charing
cross
underground
i
sprang
does
not
interest
me
said
annette
plot
thickens
he
assured
her
left
our
hero
springing
i
think
just
so
well
you
took
the
west
end
train
and
got
off
at
sloane
square
so
did
i
you
crossed
sloane
square
turned
up
king
road
and
finally
arrived
here
i
followed
i
saw
a
notice
up
studio
to
let
i
reflected
that
having
done
a
little
painting
in
an
amateur
way
i
could
pose
as
an
artist
all
right
so
i
took
the
studio
also
the
name
of
alan
beverley
my
own
is
bill
bates
i
had
often
wondered
what
it
would
feel
like
to
be
called
by
some
name
like
alan
beverley
or
cyril
trevelyan
it
was
simply
the
spin
of
the
coin
which
decided
me
in
favour
of
the
former
once
in
the
problem
was
how
to
get
to
know
you
when
i
heard
you
playing
i
knew
it
was
all
right
i
had
only
to
keep
knocking
on
the
floor
long
enough
you
mean
to
tell
me
annette
voice
trembled
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
knocked
that
time
simply
to
make
me
come
up
was
it
rather
a
scheme
do
you
think
and
now
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
found
out
that
i
had
been
buying
your
waltz
those
remarks
of
yours
about
fools
paradises
were
not
inspired
solely
by
the
affairs
of
sellers
but
it
beats
me
how
you
did
it
i
swore
rozinsky
or
whatever
his
name
is
to
secrecy
mr
morrison
sad
annette
indifferently
up
on
the
telephone
and
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
was
greatly
worried
by
the
piles
of
music
which
were
littering
the
rooms
you
lent
him
the
young
man
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
old
morrison
i
forgot
all
about
him
i
lent
him
my
rooms
at
the
albany
he
writing
a
novel
and
he
ca
work
if
the
slightest
thing
goes
wrong
it
just
shows
bates
you
did
intend
to
hurt
me
i
dare
say
you
meant
only
to
be
kind
but
but
oh
ca
you
see
how
you
have
humiliated
me
you
have
treated
me
like
a
child
giving
me
a
success
just
to
just
to
keep
me
quiet
i
suppose
you
he
was
fumbling
in
his
pocket
i
read
you
a
letter
he
said
letter
a
short
one
it
is
from
epstein
the
this
is
what
he
says
sir
meaning
me
not
dear
bill
mind
you
just
sir
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
inform
you
that
i
have
this
morning
received
an
offer
of
ten
guineas
for
your
picture
and
cat
kindly
let
me
know
if
i
am
to
dispose
of
it
at
this
price
said
annette
in
a
small
voice
have
just
been
to
epstein
it
seems
that
the
purchaser
is
a
miss
brown
she
gave
an
address
in
bayswater
i
called
at
the
address
no
miss
brown
lives
there
but
one
of
your
pupils
does
i
asked
her
if
she
was
expecting
a
parcel
for
miss
brown
and
she
said
that
she
had
had
your
letter
and
quite
understood
and
would
take
it
in
when
it
arrived
annette
was
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
away
she
said
faintly
mr
bates
moved
a
step
nearer
you
remember
that
story
of
the
people
on
the
island
who
eked
out
a
precarious
livelihood
by
taking
in
one
another
washing
he
asked
casually
away
cried
annette
always
thought
he
said
it
must
have
drawn
them
very
close
together
made
them
feel
rather
attached
to
each
other
you
away
do
want
to
go
away
i
want
to
stay
and
hear
you
say
you
marry
me
go
away
i
want
to
think
she
heard
him
moving
towards
the
door
he
stopped
then
went
on
again
the
door
closed
quietly
presently
from
the
room
above
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
footsteps
pacing
monotonously
to
and
fro
like
those
of
an
animal
in
a
cage
annette
sat
listening
there
was
no
break
in
the
footsteps
suddenly
she
got
up
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
long
pole
used
for
raising
and
lowering
the
she
took
it
and
for
a
moment
stood
irresolute
then
with
a
quick
movement
she
lifted
it
and
stabbed
three
times
at
the
ceiling
something
to
worry
about
a
girl
stood
on
the
shingle
that
fringes
millbourne
bay
gazing
at
the
red
roofs
of
the
little
village
across
the
water
she
was
a
pretty
girl
small
and
trim
just
now
some
secret
sorrow
seemed
to
be
troubling
her
for
on
her
forehead
were
wrinkles
and
in
her
eyes
a
look
of
wistfulness
she
had
in
fact
all
the
distinguishing
marks
of
one
who
is
thinking
of
her
sailor
lover
but
she
was
not
she
had
no
sailor
lover
what
she
was
thinking
of
was
that
at
about
this
time
they
would
be
lighting
up
the
in
london
and
that
of
all
the
deadly
depressing
spots
she
had
ever
visited
this
village
of
millbourne
was
the
deadliest
the
evening
shadows
deepened
the
incoming
tide
glistened
oilily
as
it
rolled
over
the
mud
flats
she
rose
and
shivered
what
a
hole
she
said
eyeing
the
unconscious
village
morosely
a
hole
this
was
sally
preston
first
evening
in
millbourne
she
had
arrived
by
the
afternoon
train
from
london
not
of
her
own
free
will
left
to
herself
she
would
not
have
come
within
sixty
miles
of
the
place
london
supplied
all
that
she
demanded
from
life
she
had
been
born
in
london
she
had
lived
there
ever
since
she
hoped
to
die
there
she
liked
fogs
noise
policemen
shops
artificial
light
stone
pavements
houses
in
long
grey
rows
mud
and
exhibitions
especially
exhibitions
it
was
indeed
her
taste
for
these
that
had
caused
her
banishment
to
millbourne
the
great
public
is
not
yet
unanimous
on
the
subject
of
exhibitions
sally
as
i
have
said
approved
of
them
her
father
on
the
other
hand
did
not
an
austere
who
let
lodgings
in
ebury
street
and
preached
on
sundays
in
hyde
park
he
looked
askance
at
the
it
was
his
boast
that
he
had
never
been
inside
a
theatre
in
his
life
and
he
classed
cinema
palaces
with
theatres
as
wiles
of
the
devil
sally
suddenly
unmasked
as
an
habitual
frequenter
of
these
abandoned
places
sprang
with
one
bound
into
prominence
as
the
bad
girl
of
the
family
instant
removal
from
the
range
of
temptation
being
the
only
possible
plan
it
seemed
to
mr
preston
that
a
trip
to
the
country
was
indicated
he
selected
millbourne
because
he
had
been
butler
at
the
hall
there
and
because
his
sister
jane
who
had
been
a
at
the
rectory
was
now
married
and
living
in
the
village
certainly
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
promising
reformatory
for
sally
here
if
anywhere
might
she
forget
the
heady
joys
of
the
cinema
tucked
away
in
the
corner
of
its
little
bay
which
an
accommodating
island
converts
into
a
still
lagoon
millbourne
lies
dozing
in
all
sleepy
hampshire
there
is
no
sleepier
spot
it
is
a
place
of
men
and
drowsy
dogs
things
crumble
away
and
are
not
replaced
tradesmen
book
orders
and
then
lose
interest
and
forget
to
deliver
the
goods
only
centenarians
die
and
nobody
worries
about
anything
or
did
not
until
sally
came
and
gave
them
something
to
worry
about
next
door
to
sally
aunt
jane
in
a
cosy
little
cottage
with
a
wonderful
little
garden
lived
thomas
kitchener
a
large
grave
young
man
who
by
sheer
application
to
work
had
become
already
though
only
second
gardener
at
the
hall
gardening
absorbed
him
when
he
was
not
working
at
the
hall
he
was
working
at
home
on
the
morning
following
sally
arrival
it
being
a
thursday
and
his
day
off
he
was
crouching
in
a
constrained
attitude
in
his
garden
every
fibre
of
his
being
concentrated
on
the
interment
of
a
plump
young
bulb
consequently
when
a
chunk
of
mud
came
sailing
over
the
fence
he
did
not
notice
it
a
second
however
compelled
attention
by
bursting
like
a
shell
on
the
back
of
his
neck
he
looked
up
startled
nobody
was
in
sight
he
was
puzzled
it
could
hardly
be
raining
mud
yet
the
alternative
theory
that
someone
in
the
next
garden
was
throwing
it
was
hardly
less
bizarre
the
nature
of
his
friendship
with
sally
aunt
jane
and
old
mr
williams
her
husband
was
comfortable
rather
than
rollicking
it
was
inconceivable
that
they
should
be
flinging
clods
at
him
as
he
stood
wondering
whether
he
should
go
to
the
fence
and
look
over
or
simply
accept
the
phenomenon
as
one
of
those
things
which
no
fellow
can
understand
there
popped
up
before
him
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
girl
poised
in
her
right
hand
was
a
third
clod
which
seeing
that
there
was
now
no
need
for
its
services
she
allowed
to
fall
to
the
ground
she
said
morning
she
was
a
pretty
girl
small
and
trim
tom
was
by
way
of
being
the
strong
silent
man
with
a
career
to
think
of
and
no
time
for
bothering
about
girls
but
he
saw
that
there
was
moreover
a
certain
alertness
in
her
expression
rarely
found
in
the
feminine
population
of
millbourne
who
were
apt
to
be
slightly
bovine
do
you
think
messing
about
at
she
said
affably
tom
was
a
young
man
who
liked
to
have
his
thoughts
well
under
control
before
he
spoke
he
was
not
one
of
your
gay
rattlers
besides
there
was
something
about
this
girl
which
confused
him
to
an
extraordinary
extent
he
was
conscious
of
new
and
strange
emotions
he
stood
staring
silently
your
name
anyway
he
could
answer
that
he
did
so
mine
sally
preston
mrs
williams
is
my
aunt
i
come
from
london
tom
had
no
remarks
to
make
about
london
you
lived
here
all
your
life
said
tom
goodness
do
you
ever
feel
fed
up
do
you
want
a
change
tom
considered
the
point
he
said
do
i
want
one
now
a
nice
place
hazarded
tom
nothing
of
the
sort
it
the
beastliest
hole
in
existence
absolutely
chronic
perhaps
you
wonder
why
i
here
do
think
i
to
come
here
not
me
i
was
sent
it
was
like
this
she
gave
him
a
rapid
summary
of
her
troubles
do
you
call
it
a
bit
thick
she
concluded
tom
considered
this
point
too
must
make
the
best
of
it
he
said
at
length
wo
i
make
father
take
me
back
tom
considered
this
point
also
rarely
if
ever
had
he
been
given
so
many
things
to
think
about
in
one
morning
he
inquired
at
length
do
know
i
find
some
way
you
see
if
i
do
i
get
away
from
here
jolly
quick
i
give
you
word
tom
bent
low
over
a
his
face
was
hidden
but
the
brown
of
his
neck
seemed
to
take
on
a
richer
hue
and
his
ears
were
undeniably
crimson
his
feet
moved
restlessly
and
from
his
unseen
mouth
there
proceeded
the
first
gallant
speech
his
lips
had
ever
framed
merely
considered
as
a
speech
it
was
perhaps
nothing
wonderful
but
from
tom
it
was
a
miracle
of
chivalry
and
polish
what
he
said
was
hope
not
and
instinct
telling
him
that
he
had
made
his
supreme
effort
and
that
anything
further
must
be
bathos
he
turned
abruptly
and
stalked
into
his
cottage
where
he
drank
tea
and
ate
bacon
and
thought
chaotic
thoughts
and
when
his
appetite
declined
to
carry
him
more
than
through
the
third
rasher
he
understood
he
was
in
love
these
strong
silent
men
who
mean
to
be
before
they
are
thirty
and
eliminate
woman
from
their
lives
as
a
dangerous
obstacle
to
the
successful
career
pay
a
heavy
penalty
when
they
do
fall
in
love
the
average
irresponsible
young
man
who
has
hung
about
north
street
on
saturday
nights
walked
through
the
meadows
and
round
by
the
mill
and
back
home
past
the
creek
on
sunday
afternoons
taken
his
seat
in
the
brake
for
the
annual
outing
shuffled
his
way
through
the
polka
at
the
tradesmen
ball
and
generally
seized
all
legitimate
opportunities
for
sporting
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
has
a
hundred
advantages
which
your
successful
careerer
lacks
there
was
hardly
a
moment
during
the
days
which
followed
when
tom
did
not
regret
his
neglected
education
for
he
was
not
sally
only
victim
in
millbourne
that
was
the
trouble
her
beauty
was
not
of
that
elusive
type
which
steals
imperceptibly
into
the
vision
of
the
rare
connoisseur
it
was
sudden
and
compelling
it
hit
you
bright
brown
eyes
beneath
a
mass
of
fair
hair
a
determined
little
chin
a
slim
figure
these
are
disturbing
things
and
the
youths
of
peaceful
millbourne
sat
up
and
took
notice
as
one
youth
throw
your
mind
back
to
the
last
musical
comedy
you
saw
recall
the
leading
lady
song
with
chorus
of
young
men
all
proffering
devotion
simultaneously
in
a
neat
row
well
that
was
how
the
lads
of
the
village
comported
themselves
towards
sally
mr
and
mrs
williams
till
then
a
but
couple
were
astonished
at
the
sudden
influx
of
visitors
the
cottage
became
practically
a
there
was
not
an
evening
when
the
little
looking
out
on
the
garden
was
not
packed
it
is
true
that
the
conversation
lacked
some
of
the
sparkle
generally
found
in
the
better
class
of
to
be
absolutely
accurate
there
was
hardly
any
conversation
the
youths
of
melbourne
were
sturdy
and
honest
they
were
the
backbone
of
england
england
in
her
hour
of
need
could
have
called
upon
them
with
the
comfortable
certainty
that
unless
they
happened
to
be
otherwise
engaged
they
would
leap
to
her
aid
but
they
did
not
shine
at
conversationally
they
were
a
spent
force
after
they
had
asked
mr
williams
how
his
rheumatism
was
thereafter
they
contented
themselves
with
sitting
massively
about
in
corners
glowering
at
each
other
still
it
was
all
very
jolly
and
sociable
and
helped
to
pass
the
long
evenings
and
as
mrs
williams
pointed
out
in
reply
to
some
rather
strong
remarks
from
mr
williams
on
the
subject
of
packs
of
young
fools
who
made
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
get
a
quiet
smoke
in
his
own
home
it
kept
them
out
of
the
tom
kitchener
meanwhile
observed
the
invasion
with
growing
dismay
shyness
barred
him
from
the
evening
gatherings
and
what
was
going
on
in
that
house
with
young
bloods
like
ted
pringle
albert
parsons
arthur
brown
and
joe
blossom
to
name
four
of
the
most
assiduous
exercising
their
fascinations
at
close
range
he
did
not
like
to
think
again
and
again
he
strove
to
brace
himself
up
to
join
the
feasts
of
reason
and
flows
of
soul
which
he
knew
were
taking
place
nightly
around
the
object
of
his
devotions
but
every
time
he
failed
habit
is
a
terrible
thing
it
shackles
the
strongest
and
tom
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
inquiring
after
mr
williams
rheumatism
over
the
garden
fence
first
thing
in
the
morning
it
was
a
civil
neighbourly
thing
to
do
but
it
annihilated
the
only
excuse
he
could
think
of
for
looking
in
at
night
he
could
not
help
himself
it
was
like
some
frightful
scourge
the
morphine
habit
or
something
of
that
sort
every
morning
he
swore
to
himself
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
mention
the
subject
of
rheumatism
but
no
sooner
had
the
stricken
old
gentleman
head
appeared
above
the
fence
than
out
it
came
mr
williams
tom
pause
indicative
of
a
strong
man
struggling
with
himself
then
the
rheumatism
mr
williams
tom
and
there
he
was
with
his
guns
spiked
however
he
did
not
give
up
he
brought
to
his
wooing
the
same
determination
which
had
made
him
second
gardener
at
the
hall
at
he
was
a
novice
at
the
game
but
instinct
told
him
that
a
good
line
of
action
was
to
shower
gifts
he
did
so
all
he
had
to
shower
was
vegetables
and
he
showered
them
in
a
way
that
would
have
caused
the
goddess
ceres
to
be
talked
about
his
garden
became
a
perfect
crater
erupting
vegetables
why
vegetables
i
think
i
hear
some
heckler
cry
why
not
flowers
fresh
fair
fragrant
flowers
you
can
do
a
lot
with
flowers
girls
love
them
there
is
poetry
in
them
and
what
is
more
there
is
a
recognized
language
of
flowers
shoot
in
a
rose
or
a
calceolaria
or
an
herbaceous
border
or
something
i
gather
and
you
have
made
a
formal
proposal
of
marriage
without
any
of
the
trouble
of
rehearsing
a
long
speech
and
practising
appropriate
gestures
in
front
of
your
bedroom
why
then
did
not
thomas
kitchener
give
sally
preston
flowers
well
you
see
unfortunately
it
was
now
late
autumn
and
there
were
no
flowers
nature
had
temporarily
exhausted
her
floral
blessings
and
was
jogging
along
with
potatoes
and
artichokes
and
things
love
is
like
that
it
invariably
comes
just
at
the
wrong
time
a
few
months
before
there
had
been
enough
roses
in
tom
kitchener
garden
to
win
the
hearts
of
a
dozen
girls
now
there
were
only
vegetables
was
ever
thus
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
a
devotion
so
practically
displayed
should
escape
comment
this
was
supplied
by
that
shrewd
observer
old
mr
williams
he
spoke
seriously
to
tom
across
the
fence
on
the
subject
of
his
passion
tom
he
said
it
tom
muttered
unintelligibly
mr
williams
adjusted
the
without
which
he
never
stirred
abroad
even
into
his
garden
he
blinked
benevolently
at
tom
making
up
to
that
young
gal
of
jane
he
proceeded
ca
deceive
all
these
and
what
not
seen
your
game
fast
enough
just
you
drop
it
young
tom
muttered
tom
rebelliously
a
sudden
distaste
for
old
mr
williams
blazed
within
him
you
only
burn
your
fingers
if
you
do
that
why
i
been
watching
this
young
gal
of
jane
and
i
seen
what
sort
of
a
young
gal
she
be
she
a
flipperty
piece
that
what
she
be
you
marry
that
young
gal
tom
and
you
never
have
no
more
quiet
and
happiness
she
just
take
and
turn
the
place
on
you
the
man
as
marries
that
young
gal
has
got
to
be
master
in
his
own
home
he
got
to
show
her
what
what
now
you
ai
got
the
devil
in
you
to
do
that
tom
you
what
i
might
call
a
sort
of
a
sheep
i
admires
it
in
you
tom
i
like
to
see
a
young
man
steady
and
quiet
same
as
what
you
be
so
that
how
it
is
you
see
just
you
drop
this
foolishness
young
tom
and
leave
that
young
gal
be
else
you
burn
your
fingers
same
as
what
i
say
and
giving
his
a
rakish
tilt
the
old
gentleman
ambled
indoors
satisfied
that
he
had
dropped
a
guarded
hint
in
a
pleasant
and
tactful
manner
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
this
interview
stung
tom
to
swift
action
otherwise
one
can
not
explain
why
he
should
not
have
been
just
as
reticent
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
when
bestowing
on
sally
the
cabbage
as
he
had
been
when
administering
the
hundred
and
sixtieth
potato
at
any
rate
the
fact
remains
that
as
that
fateful
vegetable
changed
hands
across
the
fence
something
resembling
a
proposal
of
marriage
did
actually
proceed
from
him
as
a
sustained
piece
of
emotional
prose
it
fell
short
of
the
highest
standard
most
of
it
was
lost
at
the
back
of
his
throat
and
what
did
emerge
was
mainly
inaudible
however
as
she
distinctly
caught
the
word
twice
and
as
tom
was
shuffling
his
feet
and
streaming
with
perspiration
and
looking
everywhere
at
once
except
at
her
sally
grasped
the
situation
whereupon
without
any
visible
emotion
she
accepted
him
tom
had
to
ask
her
to
repeat
her
remark
he
could
not
believe
his
luck
it
is
singular
how
diffident
a
normally
man
can
become
once
he
is
in
love
when
colonel
milvery
of
the
hall
had
informed
him
of
his
promotion
to
the
post
of
second
gardener
tom
had
demanded
no
he
knew
his
worth
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
was
a
good
gardener
and
official
recognition
of
the
fact
left
him
gratified
but
unperturbed
but
this
affair
of
sally
was
quite
another
matter
it
had
revolutionized
his
standards
of
value
forced
him
to
consider
himself
as
a
man
entirely
apart
from
his
skill
as
a
gardener
and
until
this
moment
he
had
had
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
apart
from
his
skill
as
a
gardener
he
amounted
to
much
he
was
overwhelmed
he
kissed
sally
across
the
fence
humbly
sally
for
her
part
seemed
very
unconcerned
about
it
all
a
more
critical
man
than
thomas
kitchener
might
have
said
that
to
all
appearances
the
thing
rather
bored
sally
tell
anybody
just
yet
she
stipulated
tom
would
have
given
much
to
be
allowed
to
announce
his
triumph
defiantly
to
old
mr
williams
to
say
nothing
of
making
a
considerable
noise
about
it
in
the
village
but
her
wish
was
law
and
he
reluctantly
agreed
there
are
moments
in
a
man
life
when
however
enthusiastic
a
gardener
he
may
be
his
soul
soars
above
vegetables
tom
shot
with
a
jerk
into
the
animal
kingdom
the
first
present
he
gave
sally
in
his
capacity
of
fiance
was
a
dog
it
was
a
puppy
with
long
legs
and
a
long
tail
belonging
to
no
one
species
but
generously
distributing
itself
among
about
six
sally
loved
it
and
took
it
with
her
wherever
she
went
and
on
one
of
these
rambles
down
swooped
constable
cobb
the
village
policeman
pointing
out
that
contrary
to
regulations
the
puppy
had
no
collar
it
is
possible
that
a
judicious
meekness
on
sally
part
might
have
averted
disaster
mr
cobb
was
human
and
sally
was
looking
particularly
attractive
that
morning
meekness
however
did
not
come
easily
to
sally
in
a
speech
which
began
as
argument
and
ended
mr
cobb
proving
solid
and
unyielding
as
pure
cheek
she
utterly
routed
the
constable
but
her
victory
was
only
a
moral
one
for
as
she
turned
to
go
mr
cobb
dull
red
and
puffing
slightly
was
already
entering
particulars
of
the
affair
in
his
and
sally
knew
that
the
last
word
was
with
him
on
her
way
back
she
met
tom
kitchener
he
was
looking
very
tough
and
strong
and
at
the
sight
of
him
a
idea
which
she
had
regretfully
dismissed
as
impracticable
of
assaulting
constable
cobb
returned
to
her
in
an
amended
form
tom
did
not
know
it
but
the
reason
why
she
smiled
so
radiantly
upon
him
at
that
moment
was
that
she
had
just
elected
him
to
the
post
of
hired
assassin
while
she
did
not
want
constable
cobb
actually
assassinated
she
earnestly
desired
him
to
have
his
helmet
smashed
down
over
his
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
tom
was
the
man
to
do
it
she
poured
out
her
grievance
to
him
and
suggested
her
scheme
she
even
elaborated
it
should
you
wait
for
him
one
night
and
throw
him
into
the
creek
it
is
deep
and
it
jolly
muddy
said
tom
doubtfully
would
just
teach
him
she
pointed
out
but
the
prospect
of
undertaking
the
higher
education
of
the
police
did
not
seem
to
appeal
to
tom
in
his
heart
he
rather
sympathized
with
constable
cobb
he
saw
the
policeman
point
of
view
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
but
when
you
are
stationed
in
a
sleepy
village
where
no
one
ever
murders
or
robs
or
commits
arson
or
even
gets
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
street
a
puppy
without
a
collar
is
simply
a
godsend
a
man
must
look
out
for
himself
he
tried
to
make
this
side
of
the
question
clear
to
sally
but
failed
signally
she
took
a
deplorable
view
of
his
attitude
might
have
known
you
have
been
afraid
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
jerk
of
her
chin
morning
tom
flushed
he
knew
he
had
never
been
afraid
of
anything
in
his
life
except
her
but
nevertheless
the
accusation
stung
and
as
he
was
still
afraid
of
her
he
stammered
as
he
began
to
deny
the
charge
leave
off
said
sally
irritably
a
lozenge
not
afraid
said
tom
condensing
his
remarks
to
their
minimum
as
his
only
chance
of
being
intelligible
are
not
it
just
that
i
a
nasty
gleam
came
into
sally
eyes
her
manner
was
haughty
does
matter
she
paused
no
doubt
ted
pringle
will
do
what
i
want
for
all
her
contempt
she
could
not
keep
a
touch
of
uneasiness
from
her
eyes
as
she
prepared
to
make
her
next
remark
there
was
a
look
about
tom
set
jaw
which
made
her
hesitate
but
her
temper
had
run
away
with
her
and
she
went
on
am
sure
he
will
she
said
we
became
engaged
he
said
that
he
would
do
anything
for
me
there
are
some
speeches
that
are
such
conversational
knockout
blows
that
one
can
hardly
believe
that
life
will
ever
pick
itself
up
and
go
on
again
after
them
yet
it
does
the
dramatist
brings
down
the
curtain
on
such
speeches
the
novelist
blocks
his
reader
path
with
a
zareba
of
stars
but
in
life
there
are
no
curtains
no
stars
nothing
final
and
definite
only
ragged
pauses
and
discomfort
there
was
such
a
pause
now
do
you
mean
said
tom
at
last
promised
to
marry
me
know
i
did
and
i
promised
to
marry
ted
pringle
that
touch
of
panic
which
she
could
not
wholly
repress
the
panic
that
comes
to
everyone
when
a
situation
has
run
away
with
them
like
a
strange
unmanageable
machine
infused
a
shade
too
much
of
the
defiant
into
sally
manner
she
had
wished
to
be
cool
even
casual
but
she
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
why
she
could
not
have
said
certainly
she
did
not
anticipate
violence
on
tom
part
perhaps
that
was
it
perhaps
it
was
just
because
he
was
so
quiet
that
she
was
afraid
she
had
always
looked
on
him
contemptuously
as
an
amiable
transparent
lout
and
now
he
was
puzzling
her
she
got
an
impression
of
something
formidable
behind
his
stolidity
something
that
made
her
feel
mean
and
insignificant
she
fought
against
the
feeling
but
it
gripped
her
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
found
her
voice
growing
shrill
and
out
of
control
promised
to
marry
ted
pringle
and
i
promised
to
marry
joe
blossom
and
i
promised
to
marry
albert
parsons
and
i
was
going
to
promise
to
marry
arthur
brown
and
anybody
else
who
asked
me
so
now
you
know
i
told
you
i
make
father
take
me
back
to
london
well
when
he
hears
that
i
promised
to
marry
four
different
men
i
bet
he
have
me
home
by
the
first
train
she
stopped
she
had
more
to
say
but
she
could
not
say
it
she
stood
looking
at
him
and
he
looked
at
her
his
face
was
grey
and
his
mouth
oddly
twisted
silence
seemed
to
fall
on
the
whole
universe
sally
was
really
afraid
now
and
she
knew
it
she
was
feeling
very
small
and
defenceless
in
an
extremely
alarming
world
she
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
her
she
only
knew
that
life
had
become
of
a
sudden
very
vivid
and
that
her
ideas
as
to
what
was
amusing
had
undergone
a
striking
change
a
man
development
is
a
slow
and
steady
process
of
the
years
a
woman
a
thing
of
an
instant
in
the
silence
which
followed
her
words
sally
had
grown
up
tom
broke
the
silence
that
true
he
said
his
voice
made
her
start
he
had
spoken
quietly
but
there
was
a
new
note
in
it
strange
to
her
just
as
she
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
her
so
now
she
could
not
have
said
what
had
happened
to
tom
he
too
had
changed
but
how
she
did
not
know
yet
the
explanation
was
simple
he
also
had
in
a
sense
grown
up
he
was
no
longer
afraid
of
her
he
stood
thinking
hours
seemed
to
pass
along
he
said
at
last
and
he
began
to
move
off
down
the
road
sally
followed
the
possibility
of
refusing
did
not
enter
her
mind
are
you
going
she
asked
it
was
unbearable
this
silence
he
did
not
answer
in
this
fashion
he
leading
she
following
they
went
down
the
road
into
a
lane
and
through
a
gate
into
a
field
they
passed
into
a
second
field
and
as
they
did
so
sally
heart
gave
a
leap
ted
pringle
was
there
ted
pringle
was
a
big
young
man
bigger
even
than
tom
kitchener
and
like
tom
he
was
of
silent
habit
he
eyed
the
little
procession
inquiringly
but
spoke
no
word
there
was
a
pause
said
tom
been
a
mistake
he
stepped
quickly
to
sally
side
and
the
next
moment
he
had
swung
her
off
her
feet
and
kissed
her
to
the
type
of
mind
that
millbourne
breeds
actions
speak
louder
than
words
and
ted
pringle
who
had
gaped
gaped
no
more
he
sprang
forward
and
tom
pushing
sally
aside
turned
to
meet
him
i
can
not
help
feeling
a
little
sorry
for
ted
pringle
in
the
light
of
what
happened
i
could
wish
that
it
were
possible
to
portray
him
as
a
hulking
brute
of
evil
appearance
and
worse
morals
the
sort
of
person
concerning
whom
one
could
reflect
comfortably
that
he
deserved
all
he
got
i
should
like
to
make
him
an
unsympathetic
character
over
whose
downfall
the
reader
would
gloat
but
honesty
compels
me
to
own
that
ted
was
a
thoroughly
decent
young
man
in
every
way
he
was
a
good
citizen
a
dutiful
son
and
would
certainly
have
made
an
excellent
husband
furthermore
in
the
dispute
on
hand
he
had
right
on
his
side
fully
as
much
as
tom
the
whole
affair
was
one
of
those
elemental
clashings
of
man
and
man
where
the
historian
can
not
sympathize
with
either
side
at
the
expense
of
the
other
but
must
confine
himself
to
a
mere
statement
of
what
occurred
and
briefly
what
occurred
was
that
tom
bringing
to
the
fray
a
fury
which
his
adversary
had
had
no
time
to
generate
fought
ted
to
a
complete
standstill
in
the
space
of
two
minutes
and
a
half
sally
had
watched
the
proceedings
sick
and
horrified
she
had
never
seen
men
fight
before
and
the
terror
of
it
overwhelmed
her
her
vanity
received
no
pleasant
stimulation
from
the
thought
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
this
storm
had
been
let
loose
for
the
moment
her
vanity
was
dead
stunned
by
collision
with
the
realities
she
found
herself
watching
in
a
dream
she
saw
ted
fall
rise
fall
again
and
lie
where
he
had
fallen
and
then
she
was
aware
that
tom
was
speaking
along
she
hung
back
ted
was
lying
very
still
gruesome
ideas
presented
themselves
she
had
just
accepted
them
as
truth
when
ted
wriggled
he
wriggled
again
then
he
sat
up
suddenly
looked
at
her
with
unseeing
eyes
and
said
something
in
a
thick
voice
she
gave
a
little
sob
of
relief
it
was
ghastly
but
not
so
ghastly
as
what
she
had
been
imagining
somebody
touched
her
arm
tom
was
by
her
side
grim
and
formidable
he
was
wiping
blood
from
his
face
along
she
followed
him
without
a
word
and
presently
behold
in
another
field
whistling
meditatively
and
regardless
of
impending
ill
albert
parsons
in
everything
that
he
did
tom
was
a
man
of
method
he
did
not
depart
from
his
chosen
formula
he
said
been
a
mistake
and
albert
gaped
as
ted
had
gaped
tom
kissed
sally
with
the
gravity
of
one
performing
a
ritual
the
uglinesses
of
life
as
we
grow
accustomed
to
them
lose
their
power
to
shock
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
sally
looked
with
a
different
eye
upon
this
second
struggle
she
was
conscious
of
a
thrill
of
excitement
very
different
from
the
shrinking
horror
which
had
seized
her
before
her
stunned
vanity
began
to
tingle
into
life
again
the
fight
was
raging
furiously
over
the
trampled
turf
and
quite
suddenly
as
she
watched
she
was
aware
that
her
heart
was
with
tom
it
was
no
longer
two
strange
brutes
fighting
in
a
field
it
was
her
man
battling
for
her
sake
she
desired
overwhelmingly
that
he
should
win
that
he
should
not
be
hurt
that
he
should
sweep
triumphantly
over
albert
parsons
as
he
had
swept
over
ted
pringle
unfortunately
it
was
evident
even
to
her
that
he
was
being
hurt
and
that
he
was
very
far
from
sweeping
triumphantly
over
albert
parsons
he
had
not
allowed
himself
time
to
recover
from
his
first
battle
and
his
blows
were
slow
and
weary
albert
moreover
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
than
ted
though
now
a
peaceful
tender
of
cows
there
had
been
a
time
in
his
hot
youth
when
travelling
with
a
circus
he
had
fought
week
in
week
out
relays
of
just
such
rustic
warriors
as
tom
he
knew
their
methods
their
headlong
rushes
their
swinging
blows
they
were
the
merest
commonplaces
of
life
to
him
he
slipped
tom
he
tom
he
jabbed
tom
he
did
everything
to
tom
that
a
trained
boxer
can
do
to
a
reckless
novice
except
knock
the
fight
out
of
him
until
presently
through
the
sheer
labour
of
hitting
he
too
grew
weary
now
in
the
days
when
albert
parsons
had
fought
whole
families
of
toms
in
an
evening
he
had
fought
in
rounds
with
the
boss
holding
the
watch
and
rests
and
water
to
refresh
him
and
all
orderly
and
proper
today
there
were
no
rounds
no
rests
no
water
and
the
peaceful
tending
of
cows
had
caused
flesh
to
grow
where
there
had
been
only
muscle
tom
headlong
rushes
became
less
easy
to
his
swinging
blows
more
difficult
than
the
scientific
counter
that
shot
out
to
check
them
as
he
tired
tom
seemed
to
regain
strength
the
tide
of
the
battle
began
to
ebb
he
clinched
and
tom
threw
him
off
he
feinted
and
while
he
was
feinting
tom
was
on
him
it
was
the
climax
of
the
battle
the
last
rally
down
went
albert
and
stayed
down
physically
he
was
not
finished
but
in
his
mind
a
question
had
framed
itself
the
question
it
worth
it
and
he
was
answering
there
were
other
girls
in
the
world
no
girl
was
worth
all
this
trouble
he
did
not
rise
along
said
tom
he
spoke
thickly
his
breath
was
coming
in
gasps
he
was
a
terrible
spectacle
but
sally
was
past
the
weaker
emotions
she
was
back
in
the
stone
age
and
her
only
feeling
was
one
of
passionate
pride
she
tried
to
speak
she
struggled
to
put
all
she
felt
into
words
but
something
kept
her
dumb
and
she
followed
him
in
silence
in
the
lane
outside
his
cottage
down
by
the
creek
joe
blossom
was
clipping
a
hedge
the
sound
of
footsteps
made
him
turn
he
did
not
recognize
tom
till
he
spoke
there
been
a
mistake
said
tom
a
gunpowder
explosion
more
like
said
joe
a
simple
practical
man
you
been
doin
to
your
face
going
to
marry
me
joe
joe
eyed
sally
inquiringly
you
promised
to
marry
promised
to
marry
all
of
us
you
me
ted
pringle
and
albert
parsons
to
marry
all
of
us
where
the
mistake
was
she
only
going
to
marry
me
i
arranged
it
with
ted
and
albert
and
now
i
come
to
explain
to
you
joe
promised
to
marry
the
colossal
nature
of
sally
deceit
was
plainly
troubling
joe
blossom
he
expelled
his
breath
in
a
long
note
of
amazement
then
he
summed
up
you
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
joshua
the
years
that
had
passed
since
joe
had
attended
the
village
had
weakened
his
once
easy
familiarity
with
the
characters
of
the
old
testament
it
is
possible
that
he
had
somebody
else
in
his
mind
tom
stuck
doggedly
to
his
point
ca
marry
her
joe
joe
blossom
raised
his
shears
and
clipped
a
protruding
branch
the
point
under
discussion
seemed
to
have
ceased
to
interest
him
wants
to
he
said
riddance
they
went
down
the
lane
silence
still
brooded
over
them
the
words
she
wanted
continued
to
evade
her
they
came
to
a
grassy
bank
tom
sat
down
he
was
feeling
unutterably
tired
he
looked
up
his
mind
was
working
dizzily
going
to
marry
me
he
muttered
she
sat
down
beside
him
know
she
said
dear
lay
your
head
on
my
lap
and
go
to
sleep
if
this
story
proves
anything
beyond
the
advantage
of
being
in
good
training
when
you
fight
it
proves
that
you
can
not
get
away
from
the
moving
pictures
even
in
a
place
like
millbourne
for
as
sally
sat
there
nursing
tom
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
this
was
the
very
situation
with
which
that
of
the
middle
ages
film
ended
you
know
the
one
i
mean
sir
percival
ye
something
which
has
slipped
my
memory
for
the
moment
goes
out
after
the
holy
grail
meets
damsel
in
distress
overcomes
her
persecutors
rescues
her
gets
wounded
and
is
nursed
back
to
life
in
her
arms
sally
had
seen
it
a
dozen
times
and
every
time
she
had
reflected
that
the
days
of
romance
are
dead
and
that
that
sort
of
thing
ca
happen
nowadays
deep
waters
historians
of
the
social
life
of
the
later
roman
empire
speak
of
a
certain
young
man
of
ariminum
who
would
jump
into
rivers
and
swim
in
when
his
friends
said
fish
he
would
answer
pish
fish
ca
swim
like
they
no
vim
in
just
such
another
was
george
barnert
callender
on
land
in
his
land
clothes
george
was
a
young
man
who
excited
little
remark
he
looked
very
much
like
other
young
men
he
was
much
about
the
ordinary
height
his
carriage
suggested
the
possession
of
an
ordinary
amount
of
physical
strength
such
was
george
on
shore
but
remove
his
clothes
drape
him
in
a
and
insert
him
in
the
water
and
instantly
like
the
gentleman
in
he
a
into
something
rich
and
strange
other
men
puffed
snorted
and
splashed
george
passed
through
the
ocean
with
the
silent
dignity
of
a
torpedo
other
men
swallowed
water
here
a
mouthful
there
a
pint
anon
maybe
a
quart
or
so
and
returned
to
the
shore
like
foundering
derelicts
george
mouth
had
all
the
exclusiveness
of
a
fashionable
club
his
was
a
thing
to
see
and
wonder
at
when
he
did
the
crawl
strong
men
gasped
when
he
swam
on
his
back
you
felt
that
that
was
the
only
possible
method
of
progression
george
came
to
marvis
bay
at
about
five
one
evening
in
july
marvis
bay
has
a
reputation
as
a
summer
resort
and
while
not
perhaps
in
every
respect
the
paradise
which
the
excitable
writer
of
the
local
asserts
it
to
be
on
the
whole
it
earns
its
reputation
its
sands
are
smooth
and
firm
sloping
almost
imperceptibly
into
the
ocean
there
is
surf
for
those
who
like
it
and
smoother
water
beyond
for
those
whose
ideals
in
bathing
are
not
confined
to
jumping
up
and
down
on
a
given
at
the
northern
end
of
the
beach
there
is
a
long
pier
it
was
to
this
that
george
made
his
way
on
his
arrival
it
was
pleasant
on
the
pier
once
you
had
passed
the
initial
zareba
of
fruit
stands
souvenir
stands
stands
and
the
lair
of
the
enthusiast
whose
aim
in
life
it
was
to
sell
you
picture
and
had
won
through
to
the
long
walk
where
the
seats
were
you
were
practically
alone
with
nature
at
this
hour
of
the
day
the
place
was
deserted
george
had
it
to
himself
he
strolled
slowly
along
the
water
glittered
under
the
breaking
into
a
flurry
of
white
foam
as
it
reached
the
beach
a
cool
breeze
blew
the
whole
scenic
arrangements
were
a
great
improvement
on
the
stuffy
city
he
had
left
not
that
george
had
come
to
marvis
bay
with
the
single
aim
of
finding
an
antidote
to
metropolitan
stuffiness
there
was
a
more
important
reason
in
three
days
marvis
bay
was
to
be
the
scene
of
the
production
of
a
comedy
in
four
acts
by
barnert
callender
for
george
though
you
would
not
have
suspected
it
from
his
exterior
was
one
of
those
in
whose
cerebra
the
grey
matter
splashes
restlessly
about
producing
strong
curtains
and
crisp
dialogue
the
company
was
due
at
marvis
bay
on
the
following
evening
for
the
last
spasm
of
rehearsals
george
mind
as
he
paced
the
pier
was
divided
between
the
beauties
of
nature
and
the
forthcoming
crisis
in
his
affairs
in
the
ratio
of
to
the
former
and
to
the
latter
at
the
moment
when
he
had
left
london
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
entire
theatrical
world
in
general
and
the
company
which
was
rehearsing
in
particular
rehearsals
had
just
reached
that
stage
of
brisk
delirium
when
the
author
toys
with
his
bottle
of
poison
and
the
becomes
icily
polite
as
arthur
mifflin
the
leading
juvenile
in
the
great
play
insisted
upon
calling
it
much
to
george
disapproval
was
his
first
piece
never
before
had
he
been
in
one
of
those
kitchens
where
many
cooks
prepare
and
sometimes
spoil
the
theatrical
broth
consequently
the
chaos
seemed
to
him
unique
had
he
been
a
more
experienced
dramatist
he
would
have
said
to
himself
was
ever
thus
as
it
was
what
he
said
to
himself
and
others
was
more
forcible
he
was
trying
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing
from
his
mind
a
feat
which
had
hitherto
proved
beyond
his
powers
when
fate
in
an
unusually
kindly
mood
enabled
him
to
do
so
in
a
flash
by
presenting
to
his
jaundiced
gaze
what
on
consideration
he
decided
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
he
had
ever
seen
a
man
afraid
shrewdly
sings
the
bard
beautiful
maid
is
a
cheering
sight
to
see
in
the
present
instance
the
sight
acted
on
george
like
a
tonic
he
forgot
that
the
lady
to
whom
an
injudicious
management
had
assigned
the
role
of
heroine
in
invariably
no
doubt
from
the
best
motives
omitted
to
give
the
cynical
his
cue
for
the
big
speech
in
act
iii
his
mind
no
longer
dwelt
on
the
fact
that
arthur
mifflin
an
estimable
person
in
private
life
and
one
who
had
been
a
friend
of
his
at
cambridge
preferred
to
deliver
the
impassioned
lines
of
the
great
renunciation
scene
in
a
manner
suggesting
a
small
boy
and
a
sufferer
from
nasal
catarrh
at
that
speaking
a
piece
at
a
treat
the
recollection
of
the
hideous
depression
and
gloom
which
the
leading
comedian
had
radiated
in
great
clouds
fled
from
him
like
some
grisly
nightmare
before
the
goddess
of
day
every
cell
in
his
brain
was
occupied
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
thoughts
by
the
girl
swimming
in
the
water
below
she
swam
well
his
practised
eye
saw
that
her
strong
easy
strokes
carried
her
swiftly
over
the
swell
of
the
waves
he
stared
transfixed
he
was
a
young
man
and
he
knew
how
it
was
to
stare
but
this
was
a
special
occasion
ordinary
rules
of
conventional
etiquette
could
not
apply
to
a
case
like
this
he
stared
more
he
gaped
as
the
girl
passed
on
into
the
shadow
of
the
pier
he
leaned
farther
over
the
rail
and
his
neck
extended
in
joints
like
a
telescope
at
this
point
the
girl
turned
to
swim
on
her
back
her
eyes
met
his
hers
were
deep
and
clear
his
bulging
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
to
george
she
continued
to
look
at
him
then
turning
over
again
she
shot
past
under
the
pier
george
neck
was
now
at
its
full
stretch
no
power
of
will
or
muscle
could
add
another
yard
to
it
realizing
this
he
leaned
farther
over
the
rail
and
farther
still
his
hat
slid
from
his
hand
he
grabbed
at
it
and
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
water
now
in
ordinary
circumstances
to
fall
twelve
feet
into
the
ocean
with
all
his
clothes
on
would
have
incommoded
george
little
he
would
hardly
have
noticed
it
he
would
have
swum
to
shore
with
merely
a
feeling
of
amused
akin
to
that
of
the
man
who
walks
into
a
in
the
street
when
therefore
he
came
to
the
surface
he
prepared
without
agitation
to
strike
out
in
his
usual
bold
fashion
at
this
moment
however
two
hands
grasping
him
beneath
the
arms
lifted
his
head
still
farther
from
the
waves
and
a
voice
in
his
ear
said
still
do
struggle
there
no
danger
george
did
not
struggle
his
brain
working
with
the
cool
rapidity
of
a
in
an
had
planned
a
line
of
action
few
things
are
more
difficult
in
this
world
for
a
young
man
than
the
securing
of
an
introduction
to
the
right
girl
under
just
the
right
conditions
when
he
is
looking
his
best
he
is
presented
to
her
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
and
is
swept
away
after
a
rapid
when
there
is
no
crowd
he
has
toothache
or
the
sun
has
just
begun
to
make
his
nose
peel
thousands
of
young
lives
have
been
saddened
in
this
manner
how
different
was
george
case
by
this
simple
accident
he
reflected
as
helping
the
good
work
along
with
an
occasional
surreptitious
he
was
towed
shorewards
there
had
been
formed
an
acquaintanceship
if
nothing
more
which
could
not
lightly
be
broken
a
girl
who
has
saved
a
man
from
drowning
can
not
pass
him
by
next
day
with
a
formal
bow
and
what
a
girl
too
there
had
been
a
time
in
extreme
youth
when
his
feminine
ideal
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
has
fuzzy
golden
hair
and
drops
things
indeed
in
his
first
year
at
the
university
he
had
said
and
written
as
much
to
one
of
the
type
the
episode
concluding
with
a
strong
little
drama
in
which
a
wrathful
father
had
starred
supported
by
a
subdued
misogynistic
son
which
things
aided
by
the
march
of
time
had
turned
tastes
towards
the
healthy
girl
who
did
things
instead
of
dropping
them
the
pleasantest
functions
must
come
to
an
end
sooner
or
later
and
in
due
season
george
felt
his
heels
grate
on
the
sand
his
preserver
loosed
her
hold
they
stood
up
and
faced
each
other
george
began
to
express
his
gratitude
as
best
he
could
it
was
not
easy
to
find
neat
convincing
sentences
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
she
cut
him
short
course
it
was
nothing
nothing
at
all
she
said
brushing
the
from
her
eyes
was
just
lucky
i
happened
to
be
there
was
splendid
said
the
infatuated
dramatist
was
magnificent
it
he
saw
that
she
was
smiling
very
wet
she
said
george
glanced
down
at
his
soaked
clothes
it
had
been
a
nice
suit
once
you
better
hurry
back
and
change
into
something
dry
looking
round
about
him
george
perceived
that
sundry
of
the
inquisitive
were
swooping
down
with
speculation
in
their
eyes
it
was
time
to
depart
you
far
to
go
far
i
staying
at
the
beach
view
hotel
so
am
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
shall
said
george
confidently
did
you
happen
to
fall
in
was
er
i
was
looking
at
something
in
the
water
thought
you
were
said
the
girl
quietly
george
blushed
know
he
said
was
abominably
rude
of
me
to
stare
like
that
but
should
learn
to
swim
interrupted
the
girl
ca
understand
why
every
boy
in
the
country
is
made
to
learn
to
swim
before
ten
years
old
and
it
is
a
bit
difficult
really
i
could
teach
you
in
a
week
the
struggle
between
george
and
george
conscience
was
brief
the
conscience
weak
by
nature
and
flabby
from
long
want
of
exercise
had
no
sort
of
chance
from
the
start
wish
you
would
said
george
and
with
those
words
he
realized
that
he
had
definitely
committed
himself
to
his
hypocritical
role
till
that
moment
explanation
would
have
been
difficult
but
possible
now
it
was
impossible
will
said
the
girl
start
tomorrow
if
you
like
she
waded
into
the
water
talk
it
over
at
the
hotel
she
said
hastily
comes
a
crowd
of
horrid
people
i
going
to
swim
out
again
she
hurried
into
deeper
water
while
george
turning
made
his
way
through
a
growing
throng
of
goggling
spectators
of
the
fifteen
who
got
within
speaking
distance
of
him
six
told
him
that
he
was
wet
the
other
nine
asked
him
if
he
had
fallen
her
name
was
vaughan
and
she
was
visiting
marvis
bay
in
company
with
an
aunt
so
much
george
ascertained
from
the
management
of
the
hotel
later
after
dinner
meeting
both
ladies
on
the
esplanade
he
gleaned
further
information
to
wit
that
her
first
name
was
mary
that
her
aunt
was
glad
to
make
his
acquaintance
liked
marvis
bay
but
preferred
trouville
and
thought
it
was
getting
a
little
chilly
and
would
go
indoors
the
elimination
of
the
third
factor
had
a
restorative
effect
upon
george
conversation
which
had
begun
to
languish
in
feminine
society
as
a
rule
he
was
apt
to
be
constrained
but
with
mary
vaughan
it
was
different
within
a
couple
of
minutes
he
was
pouring
out
his
troubles
the
leading
lady
the
mifflin
the
funereal
comedian
up
they
all
came
and
she
gently
sympathetic
was
endeavouring
not
without
success
to
prove
to
him
that
things
were
not
so
bad
as
they
seemed
sure
to
be
all
right
on
the
night
she
said
how
rare
is
the
combination
of
beauty
and
intelligence
george
thought
he
had
never
heard
such
a
remark
suppose
it
will
he
said
they
were
very
bad
when
i
left
mifflin
for
instance
he
seems
to
think
nature
intended
him
for
a
napoleon
of
advertising
he
has
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
about
booming
the
piece
sits
up
at
nights
when
he
ought
to
be
sleeping
or
studying
his
part
thinking
out
new
schemes
for
advertising
the
show
and
the
comedian
his
speciality
is
drawing
me
aside
and
asking
me
to
write
in
new
scenes
for
him
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
just
came
away
and
left
them
to
fight
it
out
among
themselves
sure
you
have
no
need
to
worry
a
play
with
such
a
good
story
is
certain
to
succeed
george
had
previously
obliged
with
a
brief
description
of
the
plot
of
you
like
the
story
he
said
tenderly
thought
it
was
fine
sympathetic
you
are
cooed
george
glutinously
edging
a
little
closer
you
know
we
be
going
back
to
the
hotel
said
the
girl
those
noisome
creatures
the
hired
murderers
of
descended
upon
marvis
bay
early
next
afternoon
and
george
meeting
them
at
the
station
in
reluctant
pursuance
of
a
promise
given
to
arthur
mifflin
felt
moodily
that
if
only
they
could
make
their
acting
as
full
of
colour
as
their
clothes
the
play
would
be
one
of
the
most
pronounced
successes
of
modern
times
in
the
forefront
gleamed
like
the
white
plumes
of
navarre
the
light
flannel
suit
of
arthur
mifflin
the
woodenest
juvenile
in
captivity
his
woodenness
was
however
confined
to
stage
rehearsals
it
may
be
mentioned
that
once
the
run
of
a
piece
had
begun
he
was
sufficiently
volatile
and
in
private
life
he
was
almost
excessively
so
a
fact
which
had
been
noted
at
an
early
date
by
the
authorities
of
his
university
the
discovery
leading
to
his
tearing
himself
away
from
alma
mater
by
request
with
some
suddenness
he
was
a
long
slender
youth
with
green
eyes
hair
and
a
passionate
fondness
for
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
here
we
are
he
said
kicking
breezily
at
george
leg
with
his
cane
saw
you
said
george
coldly
whole
team
continued
mr
mifflin
bright
bonny
and
trained
to
the
minute
happened
after
i
left
george
asked
anybody
begun
to
act
yet
or
are
they
waiting
till
the
rehearsals
admitted
mr
mifflin
handsomely
perfect
but
you
wait
it
be
all
right
on
the
night
george
thought
he
had
never
heard
such
a
futile
vapid
remark
said
mr
mifflin
have
an
idea
which
will
make
the
show
lend
me
your
ear
both
ears
you
shall
have
them
back
tell
me
what
pulls
people
into
a
theatre
a
good
play
sometimes
but
failing
that
as
in
the
present
case
what
fine
acting
by
the
leading
juvenile
we
have
that
but
it
is
not
enough
no
my
boy
advertisement
is
the
thing
look
at
all
these
men
on
the
beach
are
they
going
to
roll
in
of
their
own
free
wills
to
see
a
play
like
not
on
your
life
about
the
time
the
curtain
rises
every
man
of
them
will
be
sitting
in
his
own
private
corner
of
the
beach
many
corners
do
you
think
the
beach
has
into
a
girl
eyes
singing
shine
on
thou
harvest
moon
and
telling
her
how
his
boss
is
practically
dependent
on
his
advice
you
know
do
said
george
coldly
proceeded
mr
mifflin
advertise
and
by
advertise
i
mean
advertise
in
the
right
way
we
have
a
but
for
all
the
good
he
does
he
might
be
back
on
the
old
farm
gathering
in
the
hay
luckily
for
us
i
am
among
those
present
i
have
brains
i
have
resource
what
that
said
nothing
thought
you
did
well
i
have
an
idea
which
will
drag
these
people
like
a
magnet
i
thought
it
out
coming
down
in
the
train
is
it
tell
you
later
there
are
a
few
details
to
be
worked
upon
first
meanwhile
let
us
trickle
to
the
and
take
a
sail
in
one
of
those
boats
i
am
at
my
best
in
a
boat
i
rather
fancy
nature
intended
me
for
a
viking
matters
having
been
arranged
with
the
financier
to
whom
the
boat
belonged
they
set
forth
mr
mifflin
having
remarked
in
a
meditative
voice
seated
himself
at
the
helm
somewhat
saddened
by
his
failure
to
borrow
a
quid
of
tobacco
from
the
proprietor
for
as
he
justly
observed
without
properties
and
where
were
you
george
being
skilled
in
the
ways
of
boats
was
in
charge
of
the
sheet
the
summer
day
had
lost
its
oppressive
heat
the
sun
no
longer
beat
down
on
the
face
of
the
waters
a
fresh
breeze
had
sprung
up
george
manipulating
the
sheet
automatically
fell
into
a
reverie
a
moment
comes
in
the
life
of
every
man
when
an
inward
voice
whispers
to
him
is
the
one
in
george
case
the
voice
had
not
whispered
it
had
shouted
from
now
onward
there
could
be
but
one
woman
in
the
world
for
him
from
now
onwards
the
gave
a
sudden
plunge
george
woke
up
the
deuce
are
you
doing
with
that
tiller
he
inquired
gentle
somnambulist
said
mr
mifflin
aggrieved
was
doing
nothing
with
this
tiller
we
will
now
form
a
commission
to
inquire
into
what
you
were
doing
with
that
sheet
were
you
asleep
fault
said
george
was
thinking
you
must
break
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
said
mr
mifflin
complainingly
wish
you
would
wait
till
we
get
ashore
you
nearly
upset
us
sha
happen
again
they
are
tricky
these
sailing
boats
turn
over
in
a
second
whatever
you
do
do
get
her
broadside
on
more
breeze
out
here
than
i
thought
there
was
mr
mifflin
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
the
matter
asked
george
like
a
flash
said
mr
mifflin
complacently
always
the
way
with
me
give
me
time
and
the
artistic
idea
is
bound
to
come
just
some
little
thought
some
little
apparently
obvious
idea
which
stamps
the
man
of
genius
it
beats
me
why
i
did
think
of
it
before
why
of
course
a
costume
piece
with
a
male
star
is
a
hundred
times
more
effective
are
you
talking
about
see
now
continued
mr
mifflin
there
was
a
flaw
in
my
original
plan
my
idea
was
this
we
were
talking
in
the
train
about
the
bathing
down
here
and
jane
happened
to
say
she
could
swim
some
and
it
suddenly
came
to
me
jane
was
the
leading
woman
she
who
omitted
to
give
cues
said
to
myself
george
is
a
sportsman
he
will
be
delighted
to
do
a
little
thing
like
that
to
do
what
rescue
jane
and
you
said
mr
mifflin
to
go
in
swimming
together
while
i
waited
on
the
sands
holding
our
on
a
leash
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
up
go
her
arms
piercing
scream
agitated
crowds
on
the
beach
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
a
touch
of
cramp
will
she
be
drowned
no
barnert
callender
author
of
which
opens
at
the
beach
theatre
on
monday
evening
next
at
sharp
will
save
her
see
he
has
her
he
is
bringing
her
in
she
is
safe
how
pleased
her
mother
will
be
and
the
public
what
a
bit
of
luck
for
them
they
will
be
able
to
see
her
act
at
sharp
on
monday
after
all
back
you
come
to
the
shore
cheering
crowds
weeping
women
strong
situation
i
unleash
the
and
off
he
shoots
in
time
to
get
the
story
into
the
evening
paper
it
was
a
great
idea
but
i
see
now
there
were
one
or
two
flaws
in
it
do
do
you
said
george
occurs
to
me
on
reflection
that
after
all
you
would
have
agreed
to
it
a
something
i
do
know
what
which
is
lacking
in
your
nature
would
have
made
you
reject
the
scheme
glad
that
occurred
to
you
a
far
greater
flaw
was
that
it
was
too
altruistic
it
boomed
you
and
it
boomed
jane
but
i
did
get
a
thing
out
of
it
my
revised
scheme
is
a
thousand
times
better
in
every
way
say
you
have
another
have
and
added
mr
mifflin
with
modest
pride
is
a
winner
this
time
i
unhesitatingly
assert
that
i
have
the
goods
in
about
one
minute
from
now
you
will
hear
me
exclaim
in
a
clear
musical
voice
the
single
word
jump
that
is
your
cue
to
leap
over
the
side
as
quick
as
you
can
move
for
at
that
precise
moment
this
spanking
craft
is
going
to
capsize
george
spun
round
in
his
seat
mr
mifflin
face
was
shining
with
kindly
enthusiasm
the
shore
was
at
least
two
hundred
yards
away
and
that
morning
he
had
had
his
first
movement
of
the
tiller
will
do
it
these
accidents
are
common
objects
of
the
seashore
i
may
mention
that
i
can
swim
just
enough
to
keep
myself
afloat
so
it
up
to
you
i
would
do
this
for
everyone
but
seeing
that
we
were
boys
together
are
you
ready
cried
george
do
it
listen
you
ready
the
gave
a
plunge
lunatic
listen
to
me
it
said
mr
mifflin
george
came
to
the
surface
some
yards
from
the
overturned
boat
and
looking
round
for
mr
mifflin
discovered
that
great
thinker
treading
water
a
few
feet
away
to
work
george
he
remarked
it
is
not
easy
to
shake
one
fist
at
a
man
when
in
deep
water
but
george
managed
it
twopence
he
cried
leave
you
to
look
after
yourself
can
do
better
than
that
said
mr
mifflin
give
you
threepence
to
tow
me
in
hurry
up
it
cold
in
gloomy
silence
george
gripped
him
by
the
elbows
mr
mifflin
looked
over
his
shoulder
shall
have
a
good
house
he
said
stalls
are
full
already
and
the
filling
work
away
george
you
doing
fine
this
act
is
going
to
be
a
scream
from
start
to
finish
with
pleasant
conversation
he
endeavoured
to
while
away
the
monotony
of
the
journey
but
george
made
no
reply
he
was
doing
some
rapid
thinking
with
ordinary
luck
he
felt
bitterly
all
would
have
been
well
he
could
have
gone
on
splashing
vigorously
under
his
care
for
a
week
gradually
improving
till
he
emerged
into
a
reasonably
proficient
swimmer
but
now
in
an
age
of
miracles
he
might
have
explained
away
his
present
performance
but
how
was
he
to
and
then
there
came
to
him
an
idea
simple
as
all
great
ideas
are
but
magnificent
he
stopped
and
trod
water
said
mr
mifflin
take
a
rest
he
added
kindly
a
rest
no
need
to
hurry
here
said
george
piece
is
going
to
be
recast
going
to
exchange
parts
you
rescuing
me
see
never
mind
why
i
have
time
to
explain
it
to
you
now
do
you
understand
said
mr
mifflin
get
behind
you
and
push
you
but
do
forget
when
we
get
to
the
shore
that
you
done
the
rescuing
mr
mifflin
pondered
this
wise
he
said
is
a
strong
part
the
rescuer
but
i
not
sure
the
other
would
suit
my
style
better
the
silent
the
catch
in
the
voice
you
want
a
practised
actor
for
that
i
do
think
you
be
up
to
it
george
mind
about
me
that
how
it
going
to
be
mr
mifflin
pondered
once
more
he
said
at
length
would
do
you
mean
well
george
but
it
would
kill
the
show
we
go
on
as
before
we
said
george
unpleasantly
you
like
to
know
what
going
to
do
to
you
then
i
going
to
hit
you
very
hard
under
the
jaw
and
i
going
to
take
hold
of
your
neck
and
squeeze
it
till
you
lose
consciousness
and
then
i
going
to
drag
you
to
the
beach
and
tell
people
i
had
to
hit
you
because
you
lost
your
head
and
struggled
mr
mifflin
pondered
for
the
third
time
are
he
said
am
said
george
said
mr
mifflin
cordially
no
more
i
take
your
point
my
objections
are
removed
but
he
concluded
is
the
last
time
i
come
bathing
with
you
george
mr
mifflin
artistic
misgivings
as
to
his
colleague
ability
to
handle
so
subtle
a
part
as
that
of
rescuee
were
more
than
justified
on
their
arrival
a
large
and
interested
audience
had
collected
by
the
time
they
reached
the
shore
an
audience
to
which
any
artist
should
have
been
glad
to
play
but
george
forcing
his
way
through
hurried
to
the
hotel
without
attempting
to
satisfy
them
not
a
single
silent
did
he
bestow
on
his
rescuer
there
was
no
catch
in
his
voice
as
he
made
the
one
remark
which
he
did
make
to
a
man
with
whiskers
who
asked
him
if
the
boat
had
upset
as
an
exhibition
of
rapid
footwork
his
performance
was
good
in
other
respects
it
was
poor
he
had
just
changed
his
wet
clothes
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
doing
nothing
but
change
his
wet
clothes
since
he
had
come
to
marvis
bay
when
mr
mifflin
entered
in
a
bathrobe
lent
me
this
downstairs
he
explained
they
dried
my
clothes
they
would
do
anything
for
me
i
the
popular
hero
my
boy
you
made
the
mistake
of
your
life
when
you
threw
up
the
rescuer
part
it
has
all
the
fat
i
see
that
now
the
rescuer
plays
the
other
man
off
the
stage
every
time
i
just
been
interviewed
by
the
fellow
on
the
local
newspaper
he
correspondent
to
a
couple
of
london
papers
the
country
will
ring
with
this
thing
i
told
them
all
the
parts
ever
played
and
my
favourite
breakfast
food
there
a
man
coming
up
to
take
my
photograph
tomorrow
stock
has
gone
up
with
a
run
wait
till
monday
and
see
what
sort
of
a
house
we
shall
draw
by
the
way
the
reporter
fellow
said
one
funny
thing
he
asked
if
you
were
the
same
man
who
was
rescued
yesterday
by
a
girl
i
said
of
course
not
that
you
had
only
come
down
yesterday
but
he
stuck
to
it
that
you
were
was
quite
right
was
mr
mifflin
sat
down
on
the
bed
fellow
fell
off
the
pier
and
a
girl
brought
him
in
george
nodded
that
was
you
george
nodded
mr
mifflin
eyes
opened
wide
the
heat
he
declared
finally
and
the
worry
of
rehearsals
i
expect
a
doctor
could
give
the
technical
name
for
it
it
a
an
obsession
you
often
hear
of
cases
fellows
who
are
absolutely
sane
really
but
cracked
on
one
particular
subject
some
of
them
think
they
teapots
and
things
you
got
a
craving
for
being
rescued
from
drowning
what
happens
old
man
do
you
suddenly
get
the
delusion
that
you
ca
swim
no
it
ca
be
that
because
you
were
doing
all
the
swimming
for
the
two
of
us
just
now
i
do
know
though
maybe
you
did
realize
that
you
were
swimming
george
finished
lacing
his
shoe
and
looked
up
he
said
talk
slow
so
that
you
can
understand
suppose
you
fell
off
a
pier
and
a
girl
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
get
you
to
the
shore
would
you
say
much
obliged
but
you
need
have
been
so
officious
i
can
swim
perfectly
well
mr
mifflin
considered
this
point
intelligence
began
to
dawn
in
his
face
is
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
he
said
me
all
morning
george
voice
grew
dreamy
gave
me
a
she
thought
it
was
my
first
do
cackle
like
that
there
nothing
to
laugh
at
mr
mifflin
contradicted
this
assertion
is
you
he
said
simply
should
be
a
lesson
to
you
george
avoid
deceit
in
future
be
simple
and
straightforward
take
me
as
your
model
you
have
managed
to
scrape
through
this
time
do
risk
it
again
you
are
young
there
is
still
time
to
make
a
fresh
start
it
only
needs
meanwhile
lend
me
something
to
wear
they
are
going
to
take
a
week
drying
my
clothes
there
was
a
rehearsal
at
the
beach
theatre
that
evening
george
attended
it
in
a
spirit
of
resignation
and
left
it
in
one
of
elation
three
days
had
passed
since
his
last
sight
of
the
company
at
work
and
in
those
three
days
apparently
the
impossible
had
been
achieved
there
was
a
snap
and
go
about
the
piece
now
the
leading
lady
had
at
length
mastered
that
cue
and
gave
it
out
with
clearness
arthur
mifflin
as
if
refreshed
and
braced
by
his
bath
was
infusing
a
welcome
vigour
into
his
part
and
even
the
comedian
george
could
not
help
admitting
showed
signs
of
being
on
the
eve
of
becoming
funny
it
was
with
a
light
heart
and
a
light
step
that
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
veranda
were
a
number
of
only
one
was
occupied
he
recognized
the
occupant
just
come
back
from
a
rehearsal
he
said
seating
himself
beside
her
whole
thing
is
different
he
went
on
buoyantly
know
their
lines
they
act
as
if
they
meant
it
arthur
mifflin
fine
the
comedian
improved
till
you
would
know
him
i
awfully
pleased
about
it
george
felt
damped
thought
you
might
be
pleased
too
he
said
lamely
course
i
am
glad
that
things
are
going
well
your
accident
this
afternoon
was
lucky
too
in
a
way
was
it
not
it
will
interest
people
in
the
play
heard
about
it
have
been
hearing
about
nothing
else
it
happening
so
soon
after
so
soon
before
the
production
of
your
play
most
curious
there
was
a
silence
george
began
to
feel
uneasy
you
could
never
tell
with
women
of
course
it
might
be
nothing
but
it
looked
uncommonly
as
if
he
changed
the
subject
is
your
aunt
this
evening
miss
vaughan
well
thank
you
she
went
in
she
found
it
a
little
chilly
george
heartily
commended
her
good
sense
a
little
chilly
did
not
begin
to
express
it
if
the
girl
had
been
like
this
all
the
evening
he
wondered
her
aunt
had
not
caught
pneumonia
he
tried
again
you
have
time
to
give
me
another
lesson
tomorrow
he
said
she
turned
on
him
callender
do
you
think
this
farce
has
gone
on
long
enough
once
in
the
dear
dead
days
beyond
recall
when
but
a
happy
child
george
had
been
smitten
unexpectedly
by
a
sportive
playmate
a
bare
below
his
third
the
resulting
emotions
were
still
green
in
his
memory
as
he
had
felt
then
so
did
he
feel
now
vaughan
i
do
understand
have
i
done
have
forgotten
how
to
swim
a
warm
and
prickly
sensation
began
to
manifest
itself
in
the
region
of
george
forehead
and
in
a
few
months
i
thought
i
had
seen
you
before
and
today
i
remembered
it
was
just
about
this
time
last
year
that
i
saw
you
at
hayling
island
swimming
perfectly
wonderfully
and
today
you
are
taking
lessons
can
you
explain
it
a
croak
was
the
best
george
could
do
in
that
line
she
went
on
is
business
i
suppose
and
a
play
has
to
be
advertised
somehow
but
do
think
croaked
george
should
have
thought
it
rather
beneath
the
dignity
of
an
author
but
of
course
you
know
your
own
business
best
only
i
object
to
being
a
conspirator
i
am
sorry
for
your
sake
that
yesterday
episode
attracted
so
little
attention
today
it
was
much
more
satisfactory
was
it
i
am
so
glad
there
was
a
massive
silence
for
about
a
hundred
years
think
i
go
for
a
short
stroll
said
george
scarcely
had
he
disappeared
when
the
long
form
of
mr
mifflin
emerged
from
the
shadow
beyond
the
veranda
you
spare
me
a
moment
the
girl
looked
up
the
man
was
a
stranger
she
inclined
her
head
coldly
name
is
mifflin
said
the
other
dropping
comfortably
into
the
chair
which
had
held
the
remains
of
george
the
girl
inclined
her
head
again
more
coldly
but
it
took
more
than
that
to
embarrass
mr
mifflin
dynamite
might
have
done
it
but
not
coldness
mifflin
he
explained
crossing
his
legs
overheard
your
conversation
just
now
were
listening
said
the
girl
scornfully
all
i
was
worth
said
mr
mifflin
things
are
very
much
a
matter
of
habit
for
years
i
have
been
playing
in
pieces
where
i
have
had
to
stand
concealed
up
stage
drinking
in
the
private
conversation
of
other
people
and
the
thing
has
become
a
second
nature
to
me
however
leaving
that
point
for
a
moment
what
i
wish
to
say
is
that
i
heard
you
unknowingly
of
course
doing
a
good
man
a
grave
injustice
callender
could
have
defended
himself
if
he
had
wished
was
not
referring
to
george
the
injustice
was
to
myself
you
was
the
sole
author
of
this
afternoon
little
drama
i
like
george
but
i
can
not
permit
him
to
pose
in
any
way
as
my
collaborator
george
has
ideas
he
does
not
keep
abreast
of
the
times
he
can
write
plays
but
he
needs
a
man
with
a
big
brain
to
boom
them
for
him
so
far
from
being
entitled
to
any
credit
for
this
afternoon
work
he
was
actually
opposed
to
it
why
did
he
pretend
you
had
saved
him
she
demanded
said
mr
mifflin
essentially
a
chivalrous
nature
at
any
crisis
demanding
a
display
of
the
finer
feelings
he
is
there
with
the
goods
before
you
can
turn
round
his
friends
frequently
wrangle
warmly
as
to
whether
he
is
most
like
bayard
lancelot
or
happy
hooligan
some
say
one
some
the
other
it
seems
that
yesterday
you
saved
him
from
a
watery
grave
without
giving
him
time
to
explain
that
he
could
save
himself
what
could
he
do
he
said
to
himself
she
must
never
know
and
acted
accordingly
but
let
us
leave
george
and
return
you
mr
mifflin
there
was
a
break
in
her
laugh
do
think
there
is
any
necessity
i
think
i
understand
now
it
was
very
clever
of
you
was
more
than
cleverness
said
mr
mifflin
rising
was
genius
a
white
form
came
to
meet
george
as
he
the
veranda
callender
he
stopped
very
sorry
i
said
such
horrid
things
to
you
just
now
i
have
been
talking
to
mr
mifflin
and
i
want
to
say
i
think
it
was
ever
so
nice
and
thoughtful
of
you
i
understand
everything
george
did
not
by
a
good
deal
but
he
understood
sufficient
for
his
needs
he
shot
forward
as
if
some
strong
hand
were
behind
him
with
a
needle
vaughan
mary
i
think
i
hear
aunt
calling
said
she
but
a
benevolent
providence
has
ordained
that
aunts
can
not
call
for
ever
and
it
is
on
record
that
when
george
entered
his
box
on
the
two
hundredth
night
of
that
great
london
success
he
did
not
enter
it
alone
when
doctors
disagree
it
is
possible
that
at
about
the
time
at
which
this
story
opens
you
may
have
gone
into
the
hotel
belvoir
for
a
many
people
did
for
the
young
man
behind
the
scissors
though
of
a
singularly
gloomy
countenance
was
undoubtedly
an
artist
in
his
line
he
clipped
judiciously
he
left
no
ridges
he
never
talked
about
the
weather
and
he
allowed
you
to
go
away
unburdened
by
any
bottle
of
it
is
possible
too
that
being
there
you
decided
that
you
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
and
be
manicured
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
unlikely
moreover
that
when
you
had
got
over
the
first
shock
of
finding
your
hands
so
unexpectedly
large
and
red
you
felt
disposed
to
chat
with
the
young
lady
who
looked
after
that
branch
of
the
business
in
your
genial
way
you
may
have
permitted
a
note
of
gay
but
gentlemanly
badinage
to
creep
into
your
end
of
the
dialogue
in
which
case
if
you
had
raised
your
eyes
to
the
mirror
you
would
certainly
have
observed
a
marked
increase
of
gloom
in
the
demeanour
of
the
young
man
attending
to
your
apex
he
took
no
official
notice
of
the
matter
a
quick
frown
a
tightening
of
the
lips
nothing
more
jealous
as
arthur
welsh
was
of
all
who
inflicted
gay
badinage
however
gentlemanly
on
maud
peters
he
never
forgot
that
he
was
an
artist
never
even
in
his
blackest
moments
had
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
dig
the
point
of
the
scissors
the
merest
fraction
of
an
inch
into
a
client
skull
but
maud
who
saw
would
understand
and
if
the
customer
was
an
observant
man
he
would
notice
that
her
replies
at
that
juncture
became
somewhat
absent
her
smile
a
little
mechanical
jealousy
according
to
an
eminent
authority
is
the
of
calamities
the
sevenfold
death
arthur
welsh
was
all
that
and
a
bit
over
it
was
a
constant
shadow
on
maud
happiness
no
girl
objects
to
a
certain
tinge
of
jealousy
kept
within
proper
bounds
it
is
a
compliment
it
makes
for
piquancy
it
is
the
gin
in
the
of
devotion
but
it
should
be
a
condiment
not
a
fluid
it
was
the
unfairness
of
the
thing
which
hurt
maud
her
conscience
was
clear
she
knew
girls
several
girls
who
gave
the
young
men
with
whom
they
walked
out
ample
excuse
for
being
perfect
othellos
if
she
had
ever
flirted
on
the
open
beach
with
the
baritone
of
the
troupe
of
pierrots
like
jane
oddy
she
could
have
excused
arthur
attitude
if
like
pauline
dicey
she
had
for
a
solid
hour
with
a
stranger
while
her
fiance
floundered
in
mug
alley
she
could
have
understood
his
frowning
disapprovingly
but
she
was
not
like
pauline
she
scorned
the
coquetries
of
jane
arthur
was
the
centre
of
her
world
and
he
knew
it
ever
since
the
rainy
evening
when
he
had
sheltered
her
under
his
umbrella
to
her
tube
station
he
had
known
perfectly
well
how
things
were
with
her
and
yet
just
because
in
a
strictly
way
she
was
civil
to
her
customers
he
must
scowl
and
bite
his
lip
and
behave
generally
as
if
it
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
that
he
had
been
nurturing
a
serpent
in
his
bosom
it
was
worse
than
wicked
it
was
unprofessional
she
remonstrated
with
him
is
fair
she
said
one
morning
when
the
rush
of
customers
had
ceased
and
they
had
the
shop
to
themselves
matters
had
been
worse
than
usual
that
morning
after
days
of
rain
and
greyness
the
weather
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
the
sun
glinted
among
the
bottles
of
unfailing
lotion
in
the
window
and
everything
in
the
world
seemed
to
have
relaxed
and
become
cheerful
unfortunately
everything
had
included
the
customers
during
the
last
few
days
they
had
taken
their
seats
in
moist
gloom
and
brooding
over
the
prospect
of
coming
colds
in
the
head
had
had
little
that
was
pleasant
to
say
to
the
divinity
who
was
shaping
their
ends
but
today
it
had
been
different
warm
and
happy
they
had
bubbled
over
with
gay
is
fair
she
repeated
arthur
who
was
stropping
a
razor
and
whistling
tunelessly
raised
his
eyebrows
his
manner
was
frosty
fail
to
understand
your
meaning
he
said
know
what
i
mean
do
you
think
i
did
see
you
frowning
when
i
was
doing
that
gentleman
nails
the
allusion
was
to
the
client
who
had
just
left
a
jovial
individual
with
a
red
face
who
certainly
had
made
maud
giggle
a
good
deal
and
why
not
if
a
gentleman
tells
really
funny
stories
what
harm
is
there
in
giggling
you
had
to
be
pleasant
to
people
if
you
snubbed
customers
what
happened
why
sooner
or
later
it
got
round
to
the
boss
and
then
where
were
you
besides
it
was
not
as
if
the
customer
had
been
rude
write
down
on
paper
what
he
had
said
to
her
and
nobody
could
object
to
it
write
down
on
paper
what
she
had
said
to
him
and
you
could
object
to
that
either
it
was
just
silliness
she
tossed
her
head
am
gratified
said
arthur
ponderously
in
happier
moments
maud
had
admired
his
gift
of
language
he
read
a
great
deal
encyclopedias
and
papers
and
things
am
gratified
to
find
that
you
had
time
to
bestow
a
glance
on
me
you
appeared
absorbed
maud
sniffed
unhappily
she
had
meant
to
be
cold
and
dignified
throughout
the
conversation
but
the
sense
of
her
wrongs
was
beginning
to
be
too
much
for
her
a
large
tear
splashed
on
to
her
tray
of
she
wiped
it
away
with
the
chamois
leather
is
fair
she
sobbed
is
you
know
i
ca
help
it
if
gentlemen
talk
and
joke
with
me
you
know
it
all
in
the
day
work
i
expected
to
be
civil
to
gentlemen
who
come
in
to
have
their
hands
done
silly
i
should
look
sitting
as
if
i
swallowed
a
poker
i
think
you
might
understand
arthur
you
being
in
the
profession
yourself
he
coughed
is
so
much
that
you
talk
to
them
as
that
you
seem
to
like
he
stopped
maud
dignity
had
melted
completely
her
face
was
buried
in
her
arms
she
did
not
care
if
a
million
customers
came
in
all
at
the
same
time
she
heard
him
moving
towards
her
but
she
did
not
look
up
the
next
moment
his
arms
were
round
her
and
he
was
babbling
and
a
customer
pushing
open
the
door
unnoticed
two
minutes
later
retired
hurriedly
to
get
shaved
elsewhere
doubting
whether
mind
was
on
his
job
for
a
time
this
little
thunderstorm
undoubtedly
cleared
the
air
for
a
day
or
two
maud
was
happier
than
she
ever
remembered
to
have
been
arthur
behaviour
was
unexceptionable
he
bought
her
a
light
brown
leather
very
smart
he
gave
her
some
chocolates
to
eat
in
the
tube
he
entertained
her
with
amazing
statistics
culled
from
the
weekly
paper
which
he
bought
on
tuesdays
he
was
in
short
the
perfect
lover
on
the
second
day
the
man
came
in
again
arthur
joined
in
the
laughter
at
his
stories
everything
seemed
ideal
it
could
not
last
gradually
things
slipped
back
into
the
old
routine
maud
looking
up
from
her
work
would
see
the
frown
and
the
bitten
lip
she
began
again
to
feel
uncomfortable
and
as
she
worked
sometimes
their
conversation
on
the
way
to
the
tube
was
almost
formal
it
was
useless
to
say
anything
she
had
a
wholesome
horror
of
being
one
of
those
women
who
nagged
and
she
felt
that
to
complain
again
would
amount
to
nagging
she
tried
to
put
the
thing
out
of
her
mind
but
it
insisted
on
staying
there
in
a
way
she
understood
his
feelings
he
loved
her
so
much
she
supposed
that
he
hated
the
idea
of
her
exchanging
a
single
word
with
another
man
this
in
the
abstract
was
gratifying
but
in
practice
it
distressed
her
she
wished
she
were
some
sort
of
foreigner
so
that
nobody
could
talk
to
her
but
then
they
would
look
at
her
and
that
probably
would
produce
much
the
same
results
it
was
a
hard
world
for
a
girl
and
then
the
strange
thing
happened
arthur
reformed
one
might
almost
say
that
he
reformed
with
a
jerk
it
was
a
parallel
case
to
those
sudden
conversions
at
welsh
revival
meetings
on
monday
evening
he
had
been
at
his
worst
on
the
following
morning
he
was
a
changed
man
not
even
after
the
original
thunderstorm
had
he
been
more
docile
maud
could
not
believe
that
first
the
lip
once
bitten
was
stretched
in
a
smile
she
looked
for
the
frown
it
was
not
there
next
day
it
was
the
same
and
the
day
after
that
when
a
week
had
gone
by
and
still
the
improvement
was
maintained
maud
felt
that
she
might
now
look
upon
it
as
permanent
a
great
load
seemed
to
have
been
taken
off
her
mind
she
revised
her
views
on
the
world
it
was
a
very
good
world
quite
one
of
the
best
with
arthur
beaming
upon
it
like
a
sun
a
number
of
eminent
poets
and
essayists
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
centuries
have
recorded
in
their
several
ways
their
opinion
that
one
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
the
truth
applies
even
to
such
a
good
thing
as
absence
of
jealousy
little
by
little
maud
began
to
grow
uneasy
it
began
to
come
home
to
her
that
she
preferred
the
old
arthur
of
the
scowl
and
the
gnawed
lip
of
him
she
had
at
least
been
sure
whatever
discomfort
she
may
have
suffered
from
his
spirited
imitations
of
othello
at
any
rate
they
had
proved
that
he
loved
her
she
would
have
accepted
gladly
an
equal
amount
of
discomfort
now
in
exchange
for
the
same
certainty
she
could
not
read
this
new
arthur
his
thoughts
were
a
closed
book
superficially
he
was
all
that
she
could
have
wished
he
still
continued
to
escort
her
to
the
tube
to
buy
her
occasional
presents
to
tap
when
conversing
the
pleasantly
sentimental
vein
but
now
these
things
were
not
enough
her
heart
was
troubled
her
thoughts
frightened
her
the
little
black
imp
at
the
back
of
her
mind
kept
whispering
and
whispering
till
at
last
she
was
forced
to
listen
tired
of
you
he
does
love
you
any
more
he
tired
of
you
it
is
not
everybody
who
in
times
of
mental
stress
can
find
ready
to
hand
among
his
or
her
personal
acquaintances
an
expert
counsellor
prepared
at
a
moment
notice
to
listen
with
sympathy
and
advise
with
tact
and
skill
everyone
world
is
full
of
friends
relatives
and
others
who
will
give
advice
on
any
subject
that
may
be
presented
to
them
but
there
are
crises
in
life
which
can
not
be
left
to
the
amateur
it
is
the
aim
of
a
certain
widely
read
class
of
paper
to
fill
this
void
of
this
class
was
one
of
the
representatives
in
exchange
for
one
penny
its
five
hundred
thousand
readers
received
every
week
a
serial
story
about
life
in
highest
circles
a
short
story
packed
with
articles
on
the
removal
of
stains
and
the
best
method
of
coping
with
the
cold
mutton
anecdotes
of
royalty
photographs
of
peeresses
hints
on
dress
chats
about
baby
brief
but
pointed
dialogues
between
blogson
and
snogson
poems
great
thoughts
from
the
dead
and
brainy
in
the
editor
cosy
sanctum
a
slab
of
brown
paper
and
the
leading
feature
advice
on
matters
of
the
heart
the
weekly
contribution
of
the
advice
specialist
of
entitled
the
consulting
room
by
dr
cupid
was
made
up
mainly
of
answers
to
correspondents
he
affected
the
bedside
manner
of
the
kind
breezy
old
physician
and
probably
gave
a
good
deal
of
comfort
at
any
rate
he
always
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
cases
on
his
hands
it
was
to
this
expert
that
maud
took
her
trouble
she
had
been
a
regular
reader
of
the
paper
for
several
years
and
had
indeed
consulted
the
great
man
once
before
when
he
had
replied
favourably
to
her
query
as
to
whether
it
would
be
right
for
her
to
accept
caramels
from
arthur
then
almost
a
stranger
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
go
to
him
now
in
an
even
greater
dilemma
the
letter
was
not
easy
to
write
but
she
finished
it
at
last
and
after
an
anxious
interval
judgement
was
delivered
as
follows
well
well
bless
my
soul
what
is
all
this
writes
me
am
a
young
lady
and
until
recently
was
very
very
happy
except
that
my
fiance
though
truly
loving
me
was
of
a
very
jealous
disposition
though
i
am
sure
i
gave
him
no
cause
he
would
scowl
when
i
spoke
to
any
other
man
and
this
used
to
make
me
unhappy
but
for
some
time
now
he
has
quite
changed
and
does
not
seem
to
mind
at
all
and
though
at
first
this
made
me
feel
happy
to
think
that
he
had
got
over
his
jealousy
i
now
feel
unhappy
because
i
am
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
he
no
longer
cares
for
me
do
you
think
this
is
so
and
what
ought
i
to
do
dear
young
lady
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
reassure
you
but
it
is
kindest
sometimes
you
know
to
be
candid
however
it
may
hurt
it
has
been
my
experience
that
when
jealousy
flies
out
of
the
window
indifference
comes
in
at
the
door
in
the
old
days
a
knight
would
joust
for
the
love
of
a
ladye
risking
physical
injury
rather
than
permit
others
to
rival
him
in
her
affections
i
think
that
you
should
endeavour
to
discover
the
true
state
of
your
fiance
feelings
i
do
not
of
course
advocate
anything
in
the
shape
of
unwomanly
behaviour
of
which
i
am
sure
my
dear
young
lady
you
are
incapable
but
i
think
that
you
should
certainly
try
to
pique
your
fiance
to
test
him
at
your
next
ball
for
instance
refuse
him
a
certain
number
of
dances
on
the
plea
that
your
programme
is
full
at
and
so
on
exhibit
pleasure
in
the
society
and
conversation
of
other
gentlemen
and
mark
his
demeanour
as
you
do
so
these
little
tests
should
serve
either
to
relieve
your
apprehensions
provided
they
are
groundless
or
to
show
you
the
truth
and
after
all
if
it
is
the
truth
it
must
be
faced
must
it
not
m
before
the
end
of
the
day
maud
knew
the
whole
passage
by
heart
the
more
her
mind
dwelt
on
it
the
more
clearly
did
it
seem
to
express
what
she
had
felt
but
could
not
put
into
words
the
point
about
jousting
struck
her
as
particularly
well
taken
she
had
looked
up
in
the
dictionary
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
these
few
words
was
contained
the
kernel
of
her
trouble
in
the
old
days
if
any
man
had
attempted
to
rival
him
in
her
affections
outside
business
hours
arthur
would
undoubtedly
have
jousted
and
jousted
with
the
vigour
of
one
who
means
to
make
his
presence
felt
now
in
similar
circumstances
he
would
probably
step
aside
politely
as
who
should
say
you
my
dear
alphonse
there
was
no
time
to
lose
an
hour
after
her
first
perusal
of
dr
cupid
advice
maud
had
begun
to
act
upon
it
by
the
time
the
first
lull
in
the
morning
work
had
come
and
there
was
a
chance
for
private
conversation
she
had
invented
an
imaginary
young
man
a
shadowy
lothario
who
being
introduced
into
her
home
on
the
previous
sunday
by
her
brother
horace
had
carried
on
in
a
way
you
would
believe
paying
all
manner
of
compliments
said
i
had
such
white
hands
said
maud
arthur
nodded
stropping
a
razor
the
while
he
appeared
to
be
bearing
the
revelations
with
complete
fortitude
yet
only
a
few
weeks
before
a
customer
comment
on
this
same
whiteness
had
stirred
him
to
his
depths
this
morning
what
do
you
think
why
he
meets
me
as
bold
as
you
please
and
gives
me
a
cake
of
toilet
soap
like
his
impudence
she
paused
hopefully
useful
soap
said
arthur
politely
sententious
it
was
went
on
maud
dully
conscious
of
failure
but
stippling
in
like
an
artist
the
little
touches
which
give
atmosphere
and
verisimilitude
to
a
story
scented
horace
will
tease
me
about
it
i
can
tell
you
she
paused
surely
he
must
why
a
would
be
torn
with
jealousy
at
such
a
tale
arthur
did
not
even
wince
he
was
charming
about
it
thought
it
very
kind
of
the
young
fellow
did
blame
him
for
being
struck
by
the
whiteness
of
her
hands
touched
on
the
history
of
soap
which
he
happened
to
have
been
reading
up
in
the
encyclopedia
at
the
free
library
and
behaved
altogether
in
such
a
thoroughly
gentlemanly
fashion
that
maud
stayed
awake
half
the
night
crying
if
maud
had
waited
another
hours
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
her
to
have
taxed
her
powers
of
invention
for
on
the
following
day
there
entered
the
shop
and
her
life
a
young
man
who
was
not
imaginary
a
lothario
of
flesh
and
blood
he
made
his
entry
with
that
air
of
having
bought
most
of
the
neighbouring
property
which
belongs
exclusively
to
minor
actors
men
of
weight
on
the
stock
exchange
and
american
professional
pugilists
mr
shute
belonged
to
the
of
the
three
classes
he
had
arrived
in
england
two
months
previously
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
conference
at
four
with
one
joseph
edwardes
to
settle
a
question
of
superiority
at
that
weight
which
had
been
vexing
the
sporting
public
of
two
countries
for
over
a
year
having
successfully
mr
edwardes
mainly
by
means
of
strenuous
work
in
the
clinches
he
was
now
on
the
eve
of
starting
on
a
lucrative
tour
with
his
celebrated
inaudible
monologue
as
a
result
of
these
things
he
was
feeling
very
very
pleased
with
the
world
in
general
and
with
mr
skipper
shute
in
particular
and
when
mr
shute
was
pleased
with
himself
his
manner
was
apt
to
be
of
the
breeziest
he
breezed
into
the
shop
took
a
seat
and
having
cast
an
experienced
eye
at
maud
and
found
her
pleasing
extended
both
hands
and
observed
the
limit
kid
at
any
other
time
maud
might
have
resented
being
addressed
as
by
a
customer
but
now
she
welcomed
it
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
thickening
of
the
lobe
of
one
ear
mr
shute
bore
no
outward
signs
of
his
profession
and
being
to
use
his
own
phrase
a
dresser
he
was
really
a
most
presentable
young
man
just
in
fact
what
maud
needed
she
saw
in
him
her
last
hope
if
any
faint
spark
of
his
ancient
fire
still
lingered
in
arthur
it
was
through
mr
shute
that
it
must
be
fanned
she
smiled
upon
mr
shute
she
worked
on
his
robust
fingers
as
if
it
were
an
artistic
treat
to
be
permitted
to
handle
them
so
carefully
did
she
toil
that
she
was
still
busy
when
arthur
taking
off
his
apron
and
putting
on
his
hat
went
out
for
his
lunch
leaving
them
alone
together
the
door
had
scarcely
shut
when
mr
shute
bent
forward
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
winning
whisper
look
good
to
muh
he
said
gallantly
idea
said
maud
tossing
her
head
the
level
mr
shute
assured
her
maud
laid
down
her
be
silly
she
said
i
finished
not
said
mr
shute
by
a
mile
say
do
you
do
with
your
evenings
go
home
but
when
you
do
it
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
you
ever
whoop
it
up
it
up
mad
whirl
explained
mr
shute
soda
and
cakes
and
a
happy
evening
at
lovely
luna
park
do
know
where
luna
park
is
did
they
teach
you
at
school
it
out
in
that
direction
said
mr
shute
pointing
over
his
shoulder
go
straight
on
about
three
thousand
miles
till
you
hit
little
old
new
york
then
you
turn
to
the
right
say
do
you
ever
get
a
little
treat
why
not
come
along
to
the
white
city
some
old
evening
this
evening
welsh
is
taking
me
to
the
white
city
tonight
who
is
mr
welsh
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
that
so
well
he
does
look
a
live
one
but
maybe
it
just
because
he
had
bad
news
today
you
never
can
tell
he
rose
evelina
fairest
of
your
sex
we
shall
meet
again
so
keep
a
stout
heart
and
taking
up
his
cane
straw
hat
and
yellow
gloves
mr
shute
departed
leaving
maud
to
her
thoughts
she
was
disappointed
she
had
expected
better
results
mr
shute
had
lowered
with
ease
the
record
for
gay
badinage
hitherto
held
by
the
customer
yet
to
all
appearances
there
had
been
no
change
in
arthur
manner
but
perhaps
he
had
scowled
or
bitten
his
lip
and
she
had
not
noticed
it
apparently
he
had
struck
mr
shute
an
unbiased
spectator
as
gloomy
perhaps
at
some
moment
when
her
eyes
had
been
on
her
work
she
hoped
for
the
best
whatever
his
feelings
may
have
been
during
the
afternoon
arthur
was
undeniably
cheerful
that
evening
he
was
in
excellent
spirits
his
abandon
on
the
had
been
noted
and
commented
upon
by
several
confronted
with
the
hairy
ainus
he
had
touched
a
high
level
of
facetiousness
and
now
as
he
sat
with
her
listening
to
the
band
he
was
crooning
joyously
to
himself
in
accompaniment
to
the
music
without
it
would
appear
a
care
in
the
world
maud
was
hurt
and
anxious
in
a
mere
acquaintance
this
blithe
attitude
would
have
been
welcome
it
would
have
helped
her
to
enjoy
her
evening
but
from
arthur
at
that
particular
moment
she
looked
for
something
else
why
was
he
cheerful
only
a
few
hours
ago
she
had
been
yes
flirting
with
another
man
before
his
very
eyes
what
right
had
he
to
be
cheerful
he
ought
to
be
heated
full
of
passionate
demands
for
an
explanation
a
flushed
throaty
thing
to
be
coaxed
back
into
a
good
temper
and
then
forgiven
all
this
at
great
length
for
having
been
in
a
bad
one
yes
she
told
herself
she
had
wanted
certainty
one
way
or
the
other
and
here
it
was
now
she
knew
he
no
longer
cared
for
her
she
trembled
said
arthur
walk
evenings
beginning
to
draw
in
now
that
what
i
call
a
good
tune
give
me
something
lively
and
bright
dum
tum
thing
said
maud
deliberately
a
funny
thing
gentleman
in
the
brown
suit
whose
hands
i
did
this
afternoon
was
agreed
arthur
brightly
very
funny
thing
maud
frowned
wit
at
the
expense
of
hairy
ainus
was
one
thing
at
her
own
another
was
about
to
say
she
went
on
precisely
it
was
a
funny
thing
a
coincidence
seeing
that
i
was
already
engaged
that
the
gentleman
in
the
brown
suit
whose
hands
i
did
this
afternoon
should
have
asked
me
to
come
here
to
the
white
city
with
him
tonight
for
a
moment
they
walked
on
in
silence
to
maud
it
seemed
a
hopeful
silence
surely
it
must
be
the
prelude
to
an
outburst
he
said
and
stopped
maud
heart
gave
a
leap
surely
that
was
the
old
tone
a
couple
of
paces
and
he
spoke
again
did
hear
him
ask
you
his
voice
was
disappointingly
level
asked
me
after
you
had
gone
out
to
lunch
a
nuisance
said
arthur
cheerily
things
clash
like
that
but
perhaps
he
ask
you
again
nothing
to
prevent
you
coming
here
twice
well
repays
a
second
visit
i
always
say
i
think
should
said
a
voice
behind
him
hurts
the
head
well
kid
being
shown
a
good
time
the
possibility
of
meeting
mr
shute
had
not
occurred
to
maud
she
had
assumed
that
being
aware
that
she
would
be
there
with
another
he
would
have
stayed
away
it
may
however
be
remarked
that
she
did
not
know
mr
shute
he
was
not
one
of
your
sensitive
plants
he
smiled
pleasantly
upon
her
looking
very
dapper
in
evening
dress
and
a
silk
hat
that
though
a
size
too
small
for
him
shone
like
a
mirror
maud
hardly
knew
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
much
now
either
way
nothing
seemed
to
matter
much
in
fact
arthur
cheery
acceptance
of
the
news
that
she
received
invitations
from
others
had
been
like
a
blow
leaving
her
numb
and
listless
she
made
the
introductions
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
to
meet
you
said
mr
shute
keeps
up
said
arthur
and
from
that
point
onward
mr
shute
took
command
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
mr
shute
had
made
one
of
a
trio
in
these
circumstances
for
the
swift
dexterity
with
which
he
lost
arthur
was
certainly
not
that
of
a
novice
so
smoothly
was
it
done
that
it
was
not
until
she
emerged
from
the
witching
waves
guided
by
the
pugilist
slim
but
formidable
right
arm
that
maud
realized
that
arthur
had
gone
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
secretly
she
was
beginning
to
be
somewhat
afraid
of
mr
shute
he
was
showing
signs
of
being
about
to
step
out
of
the
role
she
had
assigned
to
him
and
attempt
something
on
a
larger
scale
his
manner
had
that
extra
touch
of
warmth
which
makes
all
the
difference
he
gone
she
cried
said
mr
shute
got
a
from
the
uji
village
the
chief
cousin
wants
a
must
find
him
we
must
thing
you
know
said
mr
shute
of
time
must
find
him
mr
shute
regarded
her
with
some
displeasure
to
be
with
you
that
dub
he
said
do
understand
you
observation
was
explained
mr
shute
coldly
judging
from
appearances
that
lemon
was
the
first
and
only
love
maud
turned
on
him
with
flaming
cheeks
welsh
is
nothing
to
me
nothing
nothing
she
cried
she
walked
quickly
on
if
there
a
vacancy
said
the
pugilist
at
her
side
holding
on
a
hat
which
showed
a
tendency
to
wobble
me
in
directly
i
saw
you
see
here
what
the
idea
of
this
we
are
racing
maud
slowed
down
better
as
i
was
saying
directly
i
saw
you
i
said
to
myself
that
the
one
you
need
the
original
candy
kid
the
his
hat
lurched
drunkenly
as
he
answered
the
girl
increase
of
speed
he
cursed
it
in
a
brief
aside
what
i
said
the
original
candy
kid
so
he
shot
out
a
restraining
hand
cried
maud
not
my
name
breathed
mr
shute
tenderly
me
clarence
considered
as
an
embrace
it
was
imperfect
at
these
moments
a
silk
hat
a
size
too
small
handicaps
a
man
the
necessity
of
having
to
be
careful
about
the
nap
prevented
mr
shute
from
doing
himself
complete
justice
but
he
did
enough
to
induce
arthur
welsh
who
having
sighted
the
missing
ones
from
afar
had
been
approaching
them
at
a
walking
pace
to
substitute
a
run
for
the
walk
and
arrive
just
as
maud
wrenched
herself
free
mr
shute
took
off
his
hat
smoothed
it
replaced
it
with
extreme
care
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
said
maud
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
there
was
no
mistaking
the
meaning
in
the
eye
that
met
hers
he
cared
he
cared
he
took
no
notice
his
face
was
pale
and
working
he
strode
up
to
mr
shute
he
said
between
his
teeth
an
champion
of
the
world
has
many
unusual
experiences
in
his
life
but
he
rarely
encounters
men
who
say
to
him
between
their
teeth
mr
shute
eyed
this
freak
with
profound
wonder
teach
you
to
to
kiss
young
ladies
mr
shute
removed
his
hat
again
and
gave
it
another
brush
this
gave
him
the
necessary
time
for
reflection
do
need
it
he
said
graduated
them
up
hissed
arthur
almost
a
shocked
look
spread
itself
over
the
pugilist
face
so
might
raphael
have
looked
if
requested
to
draw
a
are
speaking
to
me
he
said
incredulously
them
up
maud
trembling
from
head
to
foot
was
conscious
of
one
overwhelming
emotion
she
was
terrified
yes
but
stronger
than
the
terror
was
the
great
wave
of
elation
which
swept
over
her
all
her
doubts
had
vanished
at
last
after
weary
weeks
of
uncertainty
arthur
was
about
to
give
the
supreme
proof
he
was
going
to
joust
for
her
a
couple
of
had
paused
interested
to
watch
developments
you
could
never
tell
of
course
many
an
apparently
promising
row
never
got
any
farther
than
words
but
glancing
at
arthur
face
they
certainly
felt
justified
in
pausing
mr
shute
spoke
it
was
he
said
carefully
i
do
want
trouble
with
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
i
he
broke
off
for
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
shout
of
approval
from
the
two
spectators
arthur
had
swung
his
right
fist
and
it
had
taken
him
smartly
on
the
side
of
the
head
compared
with
the
blows
mr
shute
was
wont
to
receive
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
arthur
was
a
gentle
tap
but
there
was
one
circumstance
which
gave
it
a
deadliness
all
its
own
achilles
had
his
heel
mr
shute
vulnerable
point
was
at
the
other
extremity
instead
of
countering
he
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
and
clutched
wildly
with
both
hands
at
his
hat
he
was
too
late
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
bounded
away
with
its
proprietor
in
passionate
chase
arthur
snorted
and
gently
chafed
his
knuckles
there
was
a
calm
about
mr
shute
demeanour
as
having
given
his
treasure
a
final
polish
and
laid
it
carefully
down
he
began
to
advance
on
his
adversary
which
was
more
than
ominous
his
lips
were
a
thin
line
of
steel
the
muscles
stood
out
over
his
crouching
in
his
professional
manner
he
moved
forward
softly
like
a
cat
and
it
was
at
this
precise
moment
just
as
the
two
spectators
reinforced
now
by
eleven
other
men
of
sporting
tastes
were
congratulating
themselves
on
their
acumen
in
having
stopped
to
watch
that
robert
bryce
intruding
fourteen
stones
of
bone
and
muscle
between
the
combatants
addressed
to
mr
shute
these
memorable
words
mr
shute
appealed
to
his
sense
of
justice
mutt
knocked
me
hat
off
i
do
it
again
said
arthur
truculently
while
i
here
you
would
young
fellow
said
mr
bryce
with
decision
surprised
at
you
he
went
on
pained
you
look
a
respectable
young
chap
too
you
pop
off
a
shrill
voice
from
the
crowd
at
this
point
offered
the
constable
all
cinematograph
rights
if
he
would
allow
the
contest
to
proceed
you
pop
off
too
all
of
you
continued
mr
bryce
if
i
know
what
kids
are
coming
to
nowadays
and
as
for
you
he
said
addressing
mr
shute
you
got
to
do
is
to
keep
that
face
of
yours
closed
that
what
you
got
to
do
i
got
my
eye
on
you
mind
and
if
i
catch
you
of
him
he
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
arthur
departing
figure
pinch
you
sure
as
you
alive
he
paused
have
done
it
already
he
added
pensively
it
was
me
birthday
arthur
welsh
turned
sharply
for
some
time
he
had
been
dimly
aware
that
somebody
was
calling
his
name
arthur
she
was
breathing
quickly
he
could
see
the
tears
in
her
eyes
been
running
you
walked
so
fast
he
stared
down
at
her
gloomily
away
he
said
done
with
you
she
clutched
at
his
coat
listen
listen
it
all
a
mistake
i
thought
you
you
care
for
me
any
more
and
i
was
miserable
and
i
wrote
to
the
paper
and
asked
what
should
i
do
and
they
said
i
ought
to
test
you
and
try
and
make
you
jealous
and
that
that
would
relieve
my
apprehensions
and
i
hated
it
but
i
did
it
and
you
did
seem
to
care
till
now
and
you
know
that
there
nobody
but
you
the
paper
what
he
stammered
yes
yes
i
wrote
to
and
dr
cupid
said
that
when
jealousy
flew
out
of
the
window
indifference
came
in
at
the
door
and
that
i
must
exhibit
pleasure
in
the
society
of
other
gentlemen
and
mark
your
demeanour
so
i
oh
arthur
luckier
than
mr
shute
was
not
hampered
by
a
too
small
silk
hat
it
was
a
few
moments
later
as
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
which
had
seemed
to
both
of
them
a
fitting
climax
for
the
evening
emotions
that
arthur
fumbling
in
his
pocket
produced
a
small
slip
of
paper
that
maud
asked
it
said
arthur
from
in
answer
to
a
letter
i
sent
them
and
he
added
with
heat
like
to
have
five
minutes
alone
with
the
chap
who
wrote
it
and
under
the
electric
light
maud
read
answers
to
correspondents
the
heart
arthur
jealousy
arthur
is
not
only
the
most
wicked
but
the
most
foolish
of
passions
shakespeare
says
is
the
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
you
admit
that
you
have
frequently
caused
great
distress
to
the
young
lady
of
your
affections
by
your
exhibition
of
this
weakness
exactly
there
is
nothing
a
girl
dislikes
or
despises
more
than
jealousy
be
a
man
arthur
fight
against
it
you
may
find
it
hard
at
first
but
persevere
keep
a
smiling
face
if
she
seems
to
enjoy
talking
to
other
men
show
no
resentment
be
merry
and
bright
believe
me
it
is
the
only
way
by
advice
of
counsel
the
traveller
champed
meditatively
at
his
steak
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
altercation
which
was
in
progress
between
the
waiter
and
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
dingy
room
the
sounds
of
strife
ceased
the
waiter
came
over
to
the
traveller
table
and
stood
behind
his
chair
he
was
ruffled
he
meant
lamb
he
said
querulously
did
he
say
lamb
so
a
feller
could
hear
him
i
thought
he
said
ham
so
i
brought
ham
now
lord
percy
gets
all
peevish
he
laughed
bitterly
the
traveller
made
no
reply
people
spoke
distinct
said
the
waiter
would
be
half
the
trouble
there
is
in
the
world
not
half
the
trouble
there
be
i
should
be
here
for
one
thing
in
this
restawrong
i
mean
a
sigh
escaped
him
should
he
said
that
the
truth
i
should
be
getting
up
when
i
pleased
eating
and
drinking
all
i
wanted
and
carrying
on
same
as
in
the
good
old
days
you
would
think
to
look
at
me
would
you
now
that
i
was
once
like
the
lily
of
the
field
the
waiter
was
a
tall
stringy
man
who
gave
the
impression
of
having
no
spine
in
that
he
drooped
he
might
have
been
said
to
resemble
a
flower
but
in
no
other
respect
he
had
sandy
hair
weak
eyes
set
close
together
and
a
day
growth
of
red
stubble
on
his
chin
one
could
not
see
him
in
the
lily
class
i
mean
to
say
is
i
did
toil
neither
did
i
spin
ah
them
was
happy
days
lying
on
me
back
plenty
of
tobacco
something
cool
in
a
jug
he
sighed
once
more
you
ever
know
a
man
of
the
name
of
moore
jerry
moore
the
traveller
applied
himself
to
his
steak
in
silence
feller
simple
sort
of
feller
big
quiet
bit
deaf
in
one
ear
hair
blue
eyes
rather
had
a
just
outside
of
reigate
has
it
still
money
of
his
own
left
him
by
his
pa
simple
sort
of
feller
not
much
to
say
for
himself
i
used
to
know
him
well
in
them
days
used
to
live
with
him
nice
feller
he
was
big
bit
hard
of
hearing
got
a
sleepy
kind
of
grin
like
this
something
the
traveller
sipped
his
beer
in
thoughtful
silence
reckon
you
never
met
him
said
the
waiter
you
never
knew
gentleman
bailey
either
we
always
called
him
that
he
was
one
of
these
eton
or
fellers
folks
said
we
struck
up
a
partnership
kind
of
casual
both
being
on
the
tramp
together
and
after
a
while
we
to
be
round
about
reigate
and
the
first
house
we
come
to
was
this
jerry
moore
he
come
up
just
as
we
was
sliding
to
the
back
door
and
grins
that
sleepy
grin
like
this
something
he
says
gentleman
kind
of
gives
a
whoop
and
hollers
if
it
ai
my
old
pal
jerry
moore
jack
he
says
to
me
this
is
my
old
pal
mr
jerry
moore
wot
i
met
in
days
down
at
ramsgate
one
summer
shakes
hands
and
jerry
moore
says
is
this
a
friend
of
yours
bailey
looking
at
me
gentleman
introduces
me

are
partners
he
says

in
misfortune

is
my
friend
mr
roach

along
in
says
jerry
we
went
in
and
he
makes
us
at
home
he
a
bachelor
and
lives
all
by
himself
in
this
desirable
i
seen
pretty
quick
that
jerry
thinks
the
world
of
gentleman
all
that
evening
he
acting
as
if
he
as
pleased
as
punch
to
have
him
there
could
do
enough
for
him
was
a
bit
of
right
i
said
to
meself
it
was
too
day
we
gets
up
late
and
has
a
good
breakfast
and
sits
on
the
lawn
and
smokes
the
sun
was
shining
the
little
birds
was
singing
and
there
was
a
thing
east
west
north
or
south
that
looked
like
work
if
i
had
been
asked
my
address
at
that
moment
on
oath
i
would
have
hesitated
a
second
i
should
have
answered
no
easy
street
you
see
jerry
moore
was
one
of
these
slow
simple
fellers
and
you
could
tell
in
a
moment
what
a
lot
he
thought
of
gentleman
gentleman
you
see
had
a
way
with
him
not
haughty
he
was
more
affable
i
should
call
it
he
sort
of
made
you
feel
that
all
men
are
born
equal
but
that
it
was
awful
good
of
him
to
be
talking
to
you
and
that
he
would
do
it
for
everybody
it
went
down
proper
with
jerry
moore
jerry
would
sit
and
listen
to
him
giving
his
views
on
things
by
the
hour
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
i
was
having
visions
of
sitting
in
that
garden
a
old
man
and
being
laid
out
when
my
time
should
come
in
jerry
front
room
he
paused
his
mind
evidently
in
the
past
among
the
cigars
and
big
breakfasts
presently
he
took
up
his
tale
here
jerry
moore
was
a
simple
sort
of
feller
deafies
are
like
that
ever
noticed
not
that
jerry
was
a
real
deafy
his
hearing
was
a
bit
off
but
he
could
foller
you
if
you
spoke
to
him
nice
and
clear
well
i
was
saying
he
was
kind
of
simple
liked
to
put
in
his
days
pottering
about
the
little
garden
he
made
for
himself
looking
after
his
flowers
and
his
fowls
and
sit
of
an
evening
listening
to
gentleman
forth
on
life
he
was
a
philosopher
gentleman
was
and
jerry
took
everything
he
said
as
gospel
he
did
want
no
proofs
and
the
king
of
denmark
would
have
been
great
pals
he
just
sat
by
with
his
big
blue
eyes
getting
rounder
every
minute
and
lapped
it
up
you
think
a
man
like
that
could
be
counted
on
would
you
would
he
want
anything
more
not
he
you
say
you
be
wrong
believe
me
there
is
a
man
on
earth
that
fixed
and
contented
but
what
a
woman
ca
knock
his
old
paradise
into
with
one
punch
was
long
before
i
begin
to
notice
a
change
in
jerry
he
never
had
been
what
you
call
a
champion
talker
but
now
he
was
silenter
than
ever
and
he
got
a
habit
of
switching
gentleman
off
from
his
theories
on
life
in
general
to
woman
in
particular
this
suited
gentleman
just
right
what
he
did
know
about
woman
knowledge
was
too
busy
talking
to
have
time
to
get
suspicious
but
i
was
and
one
day
i
draws
gentleman
aside
and
puts
it
to
him
straight
gentleman
i
says
jerry
moore
is
in
love
this
was
a
nasty
knock
of
course
for
gentleman
he
knew
as
well
as
i
did
what
it
would
mean
if
jerry
was
to
lead
home
a
blushing
bride
through
that
front
door
it
would
be
outside
into
the
cold
hard
world
for
the
bachelor
friends
gentleman
sees
that
quick
and
his
jaw
drops
i
goes
on
all
the
time
i
says
that
you
talking
away
of
an
evening
jerry
seeing
visions
of
a
little
woman
sitting
in
your
chair
and
you
can
bet
we
do
enter
into
them
visions
he
may
dream
of
little
feet
pattering
about
the
house
i
says
but
they
ours
and
you
can
something
on
that
both
ways
look
alive
gentleman
i
says
and
think
out
some
plan
or
we
might
as
well
be
padding
the
hoof
now
gentleman
did
what
he
could
in
his
evening
discourses
he
started
to
give
it
to
woman
all
he
knew
began
to
talk
about
delilahs
and
jezebels
and
and
the
rest
of
it
and
what
a
mug
a
feller
was
to
let
a
female
into
cosy
home
who
only
make
him
spend
his
days
hooking
her
up
and
his
nights
wondering
how
to
get
back
the
blankets
without
waking
her
my
he
was
crisp
enough
to
have
given
romeo
the
jumps
you
have
thought
but
lor
it
no
good
talking
to
them
when
they
got
it
bad
few
days
later
we
caught
him
with
the
goods
talking
in
the
road
to
a
girl
in
a
pink
dress
could
but
admit
that
jerry
had
picked
one
right
from
the
top
of
the
basket
this
was
one
of
them
languishing
sort
wot
sits
about
in
cosy
corners
and
reads
and
do
care
what
happening
in
the
home
so
long
as
they
find
out
what
became
of
the
hero
in
his
duel
with
the
grand
duke
she
was
a
brown
slim
little
thing
know
held
her
chin
up
and
looked
you
up
and
down
with
eyes
the
colour
of
scotch
whisky
as
much
as
to
say
well
what
it
you
could
tell
without
looking
at
her
just
by
the
feel
of
the
atmosphere
when
she
was
near
that
she
had
as
much
snap
and
go
in
her
as
jerry
moore
had
which
was
a
good
bit
i
knew
just
as
sure
as
i
was
standing
there
on
one
leg
that
this
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
have
me
and
gentleman
out
of
that
house
about
three
seconds
after
the
clergyman
had
tied
the
knot
says
these
are
my
friends

tuxton
mr
bailey
and
mr
roach

are
staying
with
me

a
visit

says
sort
of
wistful
excellent
says
gentleman
we
come
too
and
we
all
goes
along
there
was
much
done
in
the
way
of
conversation
jerry
never
was
one
for
pushing
out
the
words
nor
was
i
when
in
the
presence
of
the
sect
and
miss
jane
had
her
chin
in
the
air
as
if
she
thought
me
and
gentleman
was
not
needed
in
any
way
whatsoever
the
only
talk
before
we
turned
her
in
at
the
garden
gate
was
done
by
gentleman
who
told
a
pretty
long
story
about
a
friend
of
his
in
upper
sydenham
who
had
been
silly
enough
to
marry
and
had
had
trouble
ever
since
night
after
we
had
went
to
bed
i
said
to
gentleman
gentleman
i
says
what
going
to
be
done
about
this
we
got
about
as
much
chance
if
jerry
marries
that
girl
i
says
as
a
couple
of
helpless
chocolate
creams
at
a
picnic
if
says
gentleman
he
ai
married
her
yet
that
is
a
girl
of
character
jack
trust
me
did
she
strike
you
as
a
girl
who
would
like
a
man
with
a
bit
of
devil
in
him
a
man
with
some
go
in
him
a
kind
of
man
does
jerry
fill
the
bill
he
more
like
a
doormat
with
written
on
it
than
anything
else

a
good
deal
of
miss
jane
in
the
next
week
or
so

keeps
jerry
under
what

goes
trickling
round
after
the
girl

goes
trickling
round
after
him

our
way
says
gentleman
to
me
after
one
of
these
meetings
that
girl
is
getting
cross
with
jerry
she
wants
reckless
rudolf
not
a
man
who

and
grins
when

in
on
him
and
his
girl

my
words
jack

the
sunday
after

that

announces
to
us
wriggling
that
he
had
an
engagement
to
take
supper
with
jane
and
her
folks
he
have
liked
to
have
slipped
away
secret
but
we
was
keeping
him
under
espionage
too
crisp
for
that
so
he
has
to
tell
us

gentleman
it
will
be
a
great
treat
to
jack
and
myself

will
go
along
with
you
so
off
we
all
goes
and
pushes
our
boots
in
sociable
fashion
under
the
tuxton
table
i
looked
at
miss
jane
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
honest
that
chin
of
hers
was
sticking
out
a
foot
and
jerry
did
dare
look
at
her
love
young
dream
i
muses
to
myself
how
swift
it
fades
when
a
man
has
the
nature
and
disposition
of
a
rabbit
tuxtons
was
four
in
number
not
counting
the
parrot
and
all
male
there
was
pa
tuxton
an
old
feller
with
a
beard
and
glasses
a
fat
uncle
a
big
brother
who
worked
in
a
bank
and
was
dressed
like
moses
in
all
his
glory
and
a
little
brother
with
a
snub
nose
that
cheeky
you
have
been
surprised
and
the
parrot
in
its
cage
and
a
fat
yellow
dog
and
they
all
making
themselves
pleasant
to
jerry
the
wealthy
future
something
awful
it
how
are
the
fowls
mr
moore
and
a
little
bit
of
this
pie
mr
moore
jane
made
it
and
jerry
sitting
there
with
a
feeble
grin
saying
yes
and
no
and
nothing
much
more
while
miss
jane
eyes
are
snapping
like
fifth
of
november
fireworks
i
could
feel
jerry
chances
going
back
a
mile
a
minute
i
felt
as
happy
as
a
little
child
that
evening
i
sang
going
back
home
pleased
too
jack
he
says
to
me
when
we
in
bed
this
is
too
easy
in
my
most
sanguinary
dreams
i
hardly
hoped
for
this
no
girl
of
spirit
going
to
love
a
man
who
behaves
that
way
to
her
parents
the
way
to
win
the
heart
of
a
certain
type
of
girl
he
says
beginning
on
his
theories
the
type
to
which
jane
tuxton
belongs
is
to
be
rude
to
her
family
i
got
jane
tuxton
sized
up
and
labelled
her
kind
wants
her
folks
to
dislike
her
young
man
she
wants
to
feel
that
she
the
only
one
in
the
family
that
got
the
sense
to
see
the
hidden
good
in
willie
she
does
want
to
be
one
of
a
crowd
hollering
out
what
a
nice
young
man
he
is
it
takes
some
pluck
in
a
man
to
stand
up
to
a
girl
family
and
that
what
jane
tuxton
is
looking
for
in
jerry
take
it
from
one
who
has
studied
the
sect
says
gentleman
from
john
o
groat
to
land
end
and
back
again
day
jerry
moore
looking
as
if
he
only
sixpence
in
the
world
and
had
swallowed
it
what
the
matter
jerry
says
gentleman
jerry
heaves
a
sigh
bailey

so
says
gentleman
sympathetic
you
doing
fine
if
you
knew
the
sect
as
i
do
you
would
go
by
mere
superficial
silences
and
i
can
read
a
girl
heart
jerry
he
says
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
i
tell
you
you
doing
fine
all
you
want
now
is
a
little
rapid
work
and
you
win
easy
to
make
the
thing
a
cert
he
says
getting
up
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
make
a
dead
set
at
her
folks
he
winks
at
me
do
just
sit
there
like
you
did
last
night
show
you
got
something
in
you
you
know
what
folks
are
they
think
themselves
the
most
important
things
on
the
map
well
go
to
work
consult
them
all
you
know
every
opportunity
you
get
nothing
like
consulting
a
girl
folks
to
put
you
in
good
with
her
and
he
pats
jerry
on
the
shoulder
again
and
goes
indoors
to
find
his
pipe
turns
to
me
do
you
think
that
really
so
he
says
i
says
i
do
he
knows
all
about
girls
i
reckon
says
jerry
you
can
go
by
him
every
time
i
says
well
well
says
jerry
sort
of
thoughtful
the
waiter
paused
his
eye
was
sad
and
dreamy
then
he
took
up
the
burden
of
his
tale
thing
that
happens
is
that
gentleman
has
a
sore
tooth
on
the
next
sunday
so
do
feel
like
coming
along
with
us
he
sits
at
home
dosing
it
with
whisky
and
jerry
and
me
goes
off
alone
jerry
and
me
pikes
off
and
once
more
we
prepares
to
settle
down
around
the
board
i
had
noticed
jerry
particular
but
just
now
i
catches
sight
of
his
face
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
ever
see
one
of
those
fighters
when
he
sitting
in
his
corner
before
a
fight
waiting
for
the
gong
to
go
well
jerry
looks
like
that
and
it
surprises
me
told
you
about
the
fat
yellow
dog
that
permeated
the
house
did
i
the
family
thought
a
lot
of
that
dog
though
of
all
the
ugly
brutes
i
ever
met
he
was
the
worst
sniffing
round
and
growling
all
the
time
well
this
evening
he
comes
up
to
jerry
just
as
he
going
to
sit
down
and
starts
to
growl
old
pa
tuxton
looks
over
his
glasses
and
licks
his
tongue
rover
rover
he
says
kind
of
mild
naughty
rover
he
do
like
strangers
i
afraid
jerry
looks
at
pa
tuxton
and
he
looks
at
the
dog
and
i
just
expecting
him
to
say
no
or
yes
same
as
the
other
night
when
he
lets
out
a
nasty
laugh
one
of
them
bitter
laughs
ho
he
says
ho
do
he
then
perhaps
he
better
get
further
away
from
them
and
he
ups
with
his
boot
and
well
the
dog
hit
the
far
wall
sits
down
and
pulls
up
his
chair
i
do
approve
he
says
fierce
of
folks
keeping
great
fat
ugly
yellow
dogs
that
are
a
nuisance
to
all
i
do
like
it
was
a
silence
you
could
have
scooped
out
with
a
spoon
have
you
ever
had
a
rabbit
turn
round
on
you
and
growl
that
how
we
all
felt
when
jerry
outs
with
them
crisp
words
they
took
our
breath
away
we
were
getting
it
back
again
the
parrot
which
was
in
its
cage
let
out
a
squawk
honest
i
jumped
a
foot
in
my
chair
gets
up
very
deliberate
and
walks
over
to
the
parrot
is
this
a
menagerie
he
says
ca
a
man
have
supper
in
peace
without
an
image
like
you
starting
to
holler
go
to
sleep
was
all
staring
at
him
surprised
especially
uncle
dick
tuxton
whose
particular
pet
the
parrot
was
he
brought
him
home
all
the
way
from
some
foreign
parts
hello
billy
says
the
bird
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
puffing
himself
up
billy
wah
gives
its
cage
a
bang
do
talk
back
at
me
he
says
or
i
knock
your
head
off
you
think
because
you
got
a
green
tail
you
someone
and
he
stalks
back
to
his
chair
and
sits
glaring
at
uncle
dick
all
this
was
what
you
might
call
promoting
an
easy
flow
of
conversation
everyone
looking
at
jerry
me
wondering
what
next
and
trying
to
get
their
breath
and
jerry
frowning
at
the
cold
beef
and
there
a
sort
of
awkward
pause
miss
jane
is
the
first
to
get
busy
she
bustles
about
and
gets
the
food
served
out
and
we
begins
to
eat
but
still
there
not
so
much
conversation
that
notice
it
this
goes
on
till
we
reaches
the
concluding
stages
and
then
uncle
dick
comes
up
to
the
scratch
how
is
the
fowls
mr
moore
he
says
gim
me
some
more
pie
says
jerry
what
dick
repeats
his
remark
fowls
says
jerry
what
do
you
know
about
fowls
your
notion
of
a
fowl
is
an
ugly
bird
with
a
green
tail
a
wellington
nose
and
gim
me
a
bit
of
cheese
dick
fond
of
the
parrot
so
he
speaks
up
for
him
always
been
reckoned
a
handsome
bird
he
says
he
wants
stuffing
says
jerry
uncle
dick
drops
out
of
the
talk
comes
big
brother
ralph
his
name
was
he
the
and
a
dude
he
gives
his
cuffs
a
flick
and
starts
in
to
make
things
jolly
all
round
by
telling
a
story
about
a
man
he
knows
named
wotherspoon
jerry
fixes
him
with
his
eye
and
through
interrupts
that
waistcoat
of
yours
is
fierce
he
says

says
ralph
that
waistcoat
of
yours
says
jerry
it
hurts
me
eyes
it
like
an
electric
sign
why
jerry
i
says
but
he
just
scowls
at
me
and
i
stops
is
proud
of
his
clothes
and
he
is
going
to
stand
this
he
glares
at
jerry
and
jerry
glares
at
him
who
do

says
ralph
breathing
hard

coat
says
jerry

ralph

it
up
i
tell
you
says
jerry
do
you
want
to
blind
me
pa
tuxton
interrupts
why
mr
moore
he
begins
sort
of
soothing
when
the
small
brother
who
been
staring
at
jerry
chips
in
i
told
you
he
was
cheeky
says
pa
what
a
funny
nose
mr
moore

that
did
it
jerry
rises
very
slow
and
leans
across
the
table
and
clips
the
kid
brother
one
side
of
the
and
then
there
a
general
imbroglio
everyone
standing
up
and
the
kid
hollering
and
the
dog
barking
if
you
brought
him
up
better
says
jerry
severe
to
pa
tuxton
this
would
ever
have
happened
pa
tuxton
gives
a
sort
of
howl
mr
moore
he
yells
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
behaviour

table

i
strike

says

just
then
the
parrot
cuts

of

says
and
flings
the
cage
out
of

window
now

says
to
the
yellow
dog
putting
him
out
through
the
door
and
then
he
folds
his
arms
and
scowls
at
us
and
we
all
notice
suddenly
that
he
very
big
we
look
at
one
another
and
we
begins
to
edge
towards
the
door
all
except
jane
who
staring

jane
says
jerry
i
waiting
looks
from
one
to
the
other
for
a
spell
and
then
she
moves
to
where
jerry
standing
i
stop
she
says
sort
of
quiet
we
drifts
out
the
waiter
snorted
got
back
home
quick
as
i
could
he
said
relates
the
proceedings
to
gentleman
gentleman
rattled
i
do
believe
it
he
says
do
stand
there
and
tell
me
jerry
moore
did
them
things
why
it
ai
in
the
man
after
what
i
said
to
him
about
the
way
he
ought
to
behave
how
could
he
have
done
so
just
then
in
comes
jerry
beaming
all
over
boys
he
shouts
congratulate
me
it
all
right
we
fixed
it
up
she
says
she
had
known
me
properly
before
she
says
she
always
reckoned
me
a
sheep
while
all
the
time
i
was
one
of
them
strong
silent
men
he
turns
to
gentleman
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
calling
for
his
bill
right
all
right
said
the
waiter
he
turns
to
gentleman
he
went
on
rapidly
he
says
bailey
i
owe
it
all
to
you
because
if
you
had
told
me
to
insult
her
folks
he
leaned
on
the
traveller
table
and
fixed
him
with
an
eye
that
pleaded
for
sympathy
about
that
he
said
that
crisp
insult
her
folks
them
was
his
very
words
insult
her
folks
the
traveller
looked
at
him
inquiringly
you
beat
it
said
the
waiter
do
know
what
you
are
saying
said
the
traveller
it
is
important
write
it
on
a
slip
of
paper
i
am
them
how
we
will
paul
boielle
was
a
waiter
the
word
suggests
a
being
moving
swiftly
and
without
noise
in
an
atmosphere
of
luxury
and
shaded
lamps
at
bredin
parisian
cafe
and
restaurant
in
soho
where
paul
worked
there
were
none
of
these
things
and
paul
himself
though
he
certainly
moved
swiftly
was
by
no
means
noiseless
his
progress
through
the
room
resembled
in
almost
equal
proportions
the
finish
of
a
marathon
race
the
of
a
professional
juggler
and
a
monologue
by
an
earl
court
constant
acquaintance
rendered
regular
habitues
callous
to
the
wonder
but
to
a
stranger
the
sight
of
paul
tearing
over
the
difficult
course
his
hands
loaded
with
two
vast
pyramids
of
dishes
shouting
as
he
went
the
mystic
word
was
impressive
to
a
degree
for
doing
far
less
exacting
feats
on
the
stage
performers
were
being
paid
fifty
pounds
a
week
paul
got
eighteen
shillings
what
a
blessing
is
poverty
properly
considered
if
paul
had
received
more
than
eighteen
shillings
a
week
he
would
not
have
lived
in
an
attic
he
would
have
luxuriated
in
a
on
the
second
floor
and
would
consequently
have
missed
what
was
practically
a
genuine
north
light
the
skylight
which
went
with
the
attic
was
so
arranged
that
the
room
was
a
studio
in
miniature
and
as
paul
was
engaged
in
his
spare
moments
in
painting
a
great
picture
nothing
could
have
been
more
fortunate
for
paul
like
so
many
of
our
public
men
lived
two
lives
off
duty
the
sprinting
barking
juggler
of
parisian
cafe
became
the
quiet
follower
of
art
ever
since
his
childhood
he
had
had
a
passion
for
drawing
and
painting
he
regretted
that
fate
had
allowed
him
so
little
time
for
such
work
but
after
all
he
reflected
all
great
artists
had
had
their
struggles
so
why
not
he
moreover
they
were
now
nearly
at
an
end
an
hour
here
an
hour
there
and
every
thursday
a
whole
afternoon
and
the
great
picture
was
within
measurable
distance
of
completion
he
had
won
through
without
models
without
leisure
hungry
tired
he
had
nevertheless
triumphed
a
few
more
touches
and
the
masterpiece
would
be
ready
for
purchase
and
after
that
all
would
be
plain
sailing
paul
could
forecast
the
scene
so
exactly
the
picture
would
be
at
the
dealer
possibly
one
must
not
be
too
sanguine
thrust
away
in
some
odd
corner
the
wealthy
connoisseur
would
come
in
at
first
he
would
not
see
the
masterpiece
other
more
prominently
displayed
works
would
catch
his
eye
he
would
turn
from
them
in
weary
scorn
and
then
paul
wondered
how
big
the
cheque
would
be
there
were
reasons
why
he
wanted
the
money
looking
at
him
as
he
cantered
over
the
linoleum
at
bredin
you
would
have
said
that
his
mind
was
on
his
work
but
it
was
not
so
he
took
and
executed
orders
as
automatically
as
the
in
the
corner
took
pennies
and
produced
tunes
his
thoughts
were
of
jeanne
le
brocq
his
at
bredin
and
a
little
cigar
shop
down
brixton
way
which
he
knew
was
in
the
market
at
a
reasonable
rate
to
marry
the
former
and
own
the
latter
was
paul
idea
of
the
earthly
paradise
and
it
was
the
wealthy
connoisseur
and
he
alone
who
could
open
the
gates
jeanne
was
a
large
norman
girl
stolidly
handsome
one
could
picture
her
in
a
de
maupassant
farmyard
in
the
clatter
and
bustle
of
bredin
parisian
cafe
she
appeared
out
of
place
like
a
cow
in
a
to
paul
who
worshipped
her
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
little
man
for
a
large
woman
her
deliberate
methods
seemed
all
that
was
beautiful
and
dignified
to
his
mind
she
lent
a
tone
to
the
vulgar
whirlpool
of
gorging
humanity
as
if
she
had
been
some
goddess
mixing
in
a
homeric
battle
the
whirlpool
had
other
views
and
expressed
them
one
brute
indeed
once
went
so
far
as
to
address
to
her
the
frightful
words
up
there
tottie
look
slippy
it
was
wrong
of
course
for
paul
to
slip
and
spill
an
order
of
scrambled
eggs
down
the
brute
but
who
can
blame
him
among
those
who
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
paul
in
his
views
on
deportment
in
waitresses
was
bredin
himself
the
owner
of
the
parisian
cafe
and
it
was
this
circumstance
which
first
gave
paul
the
opportunity
of
declaring
the
passion
which
was
gnawing
him
with
the
fierce
fury
of
a
bredin
customer
gnawing
a
tough
steak
against
time
during
the
rush
hour
he
had
long
worshipped
her
from
afar
but
nothing
more
intimate
than
a
morning
miss
jeanne
had
escaped
him
till
one
day
during
a
slack
spell
he
came
upon
her
in
the
little
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
her
face
hidden
in
her
apron
her
back
jerking
with
sobs
business
is
business
paul
had
a
message
to
deliver
to
the
cook
respecting
fried
coffee
and
one
stale
he
delivered
it
and
returned
jeanne
was
still
sobbing
miss
jeanne
cried
paul
stricken
is
the
matter
what
is
it
why
do
you
weep
sobbed
jeanne
angel
said
paul
is
a
pig
this
was
perfectly
true
no
conscientious
judge
of
character
could
have
denied
that
paul
had
hit
the
bull
eye
bredin
was
a
pig
he
looked
like
a
pig
he
ate
like
a
pig
he
grunted
like
a
pig
he
had
the
lavish
embonpoint
of
a
pig
also
a
porcine
soul
if
you
had
tied
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
round
his
neck
you
could
have
won
prizes
with
him
at
a
show
paul
eyes
flashed
with
fury
will
slap
him
in
the
eye
he
roared
called
me
a
tortoise
kick
him
in
the
stomach
added
paul
jeanne
sobs
were
running
on
second
speed
now
the
anguish
was
diminishing
paul
took
advantage
of
the
improved
conditions
to
slide
an
arm
part
of
the
way
round
her
waist
in
two
minutes
he
had
said
as
much
as
the
ordinary
man
could
have
worked
off
in
ten
all
good
stuff
too
no
padding
jeanne
face
rose
from
her
apron
like
a
full
moon
she
was
too
astounded
to
be
angry
paul
continued
to
babble
jeanne
looked
at
him
with
growing
wrath
that
she
who
received
daily
the
affectionate
badinage
of
gentlemen
in
bowler
hats
and
check
suits
who
had
once
been
invited
to
the
white
city
by
a
solicitor
clerk
should
be
addressed
in
this
way
by
a
waiter
it
was
too
much
she
threw
off
his
hand
little
man
she
cried
stamping
angrily
angel
protested
paul
jeanne
uttered
a
scornful
laugh
she
said
there
are
few
more
withering
remarks
than
spoken
in
a
certain
way
jeanne
spoke
it
in
just
that
way
paul
wilted
eighteen
shillings
a
week
went
on
jeanne
satirically
would
support
a
wife
yes
why
paul
recovered
himself
he
had
an
opening
now
and
proceeded
to
use
it
he
said
present
yes
it
is
true
i
earn
but
eighteen
shillings
a
week
but
it
will
not
always
be
so
no
i
am
not
only
a
waiter
i
am
also
an
artist
i
have
painted
a
great
picture
for
a
whole
year
i
have
worked
and
now
it
is
ready
i
will
sell
it
and
then
my
angel
jeanne
face
had
lost
some
of
its
scorn
she
was
listening
with
some
respect
picture
she
said
thoughtfully
is
money
in
pictures
for
the
first
time
paul
was
glad
that
his
arm
was
no
longer
round
her
waist
to
do
justice
to
the
great
work
he
needed
both
hands
for
purposes
of
gesticulation
is
money
in
this
picture
he
said
it
is
beautiful
i
call
it
the
awakening
it
is
a
woodland
scene
i
come
back
from
my
work
here
hot
and
tired
and
a
mere
glance
at
that
wood
refreshes
me
it
is
so
cool
so
green
the
sun
filters
in
golden
splashes
through
the
foliage
on
a
mossy
bank
between
two
trees
lies
a
beautiful
girl
asleep
above
her
bending
fondly
over
her
just
about
to
kiss
that
face
is
a
young
man
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherd
at
the
last
moment
he
has
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
there
is
nobody
near
to
see
he
is
wearing
an
expression
so
happy
so
proud
that
one
heart
goes
out
to
him
there
might
be
money
in
that
cried
jeanne
is
there
is
cried
paul
shall
sell
it
for
many
francs
to
a
wealthy
connoisseur
and
then
my
angel
are
a
good
little
man
said
the
angel
patronizingly
we
will
see
paul
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
she
smiled
indulgently
she
said
might
be
money
these
english
pay
much
money
for
pictures
it
is
pretty
generally
admitted
that
geoffrey
chaucer
the
eminent
poet
of
the
fourteenth
century
though
obsessed
with
an
almost
rooseveltian
passion
for
the
new
spelling
was
there
with
the
goods
when
it
came
to
profundity
of
thought
it
was
chaucer
who
wrote
the
lines
the
lyfe
so
short
the
craft
so
long
to
lerne
th
assay
so
hard
so
sharpe
the
conquering
which
means
broadly
that
it
is
difficult
to
paint
a
picture
but
a
great
deal
more
difficult
to
sell
it
across
the
centuries
paul
boielle
shook
hands
with
geoffrey
chaucer
sharpe
the
conquering
put
his
case
in
a
nutshell
the
full
story
of
his
wanderings
with
the
masterpiece
would
read
like
an
odyssey
and
be
about
as
long
it
shall
be
condensed
there
was
an
artist
who
dined
at
intervals
at
bredin
parisian
cafe
and
as
the
artistic
temperament
was
too
impatient
to
be
suited
by
jeanne
leisurely
methods
it
had
fallen
to
paul
to
wait
upon
him
it
was
to
this
expert
that
paul
emboldened
by
the
geniality
of
the
artist
manner
went
for
information
how
did
monsieur
sell
his
pictures
monsieur
said
he
did
except
once
in
a
blue
moon
but
when
he
did
oh
he
took
the
thing
to
the
dealers
paul
thanked
him
a
friend
of
him
he
explained
had
painted
a
picture
and
wished
to
sell
it
devil
was
the
artist
comment
next
day
it
happening
to
be
a
thursday
paul
started
on
his
travels
he
started
buoyantly
but
by
evening
he
was
as
a
punctured
balloon
every
dealer
had
the
same
remark
to
make
to
wit
no
room
you
yet
sold
the
picture
inquired
jeanne
when
they
met
yet
said
paul
they
are
delicate
matters
these
negotiations
i
use
finesse
i
proceed
with
caution
he
approached
the
artist
again
the
dealers
he
said
friend
has
been
a
little
unfortunate
they
say
they
have
no
room
know
said
the
artist
nodding
there
perhaps
another
way
sort
of
a
picture
is
it
inquired
the
artist
paul
became
enthusiastic
monsieur
it
is
beautiful
it
is
a
woodland
scene
a
beautiful
girl
then
he
had
better
try
the
magazines
they
might
use
it
for
a
cover
paul
thanked
him
effusively
on
the
following
thursday
he
visited
divers
art
editors
the
art
editors
seemed
to
be
in
the
same
unhappy
condition
as
the
dealers
was
their
cry
picture
said
jeanne
on
the
friday
morning
it
sold
yet
said
paul
but
angel
said
jeanne
with
a
toss
of
her
large
but
shapely
head
by
the
end
of
the
month
paul
was
fighting
in
the
last
ditch
wandering
disconsolately
among
those
who
dwell
in
outer
darkness
and
have
grimy
thumbs
seven
of
these
in
all
he
visited
on
that
black
thursday
and
each
of
the
seven
rubbed
the
surface
of
the
painting
with
a
grimy
thumb
snorted
and
dismissed
him
sick
and
beaten
paul
took
the
masterpiece
back
to
his
skylight
room
all
that
night
he
lay
awake
thinking
it
was
a
weary
bundle
of
nerves
that
came
to
the
parisian
cafe
next
morning
he
was
late
in
arriving
which
was
good
in
that
it
delayed
the
inevitable
question
as
to
the
fate
of
the
picture
but
bad
in
every
other
respect
bredin
squatting
behind
the
grunted
fiercely
at
him
and
worse
jeanne
who
owing
to
his
absence
had
had
to
be
busier
than
suited
her
disposition
was
distant
and
haughty
a
murky
gloom
settled
upon
paul
now
it
so
happened
that
bredin
when
things
went
well
with
him
was
wont
to
be
filled
with
a
ponderous
amiability
it
was
not
often
that
this
took
a
practical
form
though
it
is
on
record
that
in
an
exuberant
moment
he
once
gave
a
small
boy
a
halfpenny
more
frequently
it
merely
led
him
to
soften
the
porcine
austerity
of
his
demeanour
today
business
having
been
uncommonly
good
he
felt
pleased
with
the
world
he
had
left
his
and
was
assailing
a
bowl
of
soup
at
one
of
the
except
for
a
belated
luncher
at
the
end
of
the
room
the
place
was
empty
it
was
one
of
the
hours
when
there
was
a
lull
in
the
proceedings
at
the
parisian
cafe
paul
was
leaning
wrapped
in
the
gloom
against
the
wall
jeanne
was
waiting
on
the
proprietor
bredin
finished
his
meal
and
rose
he
felt
content
all
was
well
with
the
world
as
he
lumbered
to
his
desk
he
passed
jeanne
he
stopped
he
wheezed
a
compliment
then
another
paul
from
his
place
by
the
wall
watched
with
jealous
fury
bredin
chucked
jeanne
under
the
chin
as
he
did
so
the
belated
luncher
called
but
paul
was
otherwise
engaged
his
entire
nervous
system
seemed
to
have
been
stirred
up
with
a
pole
with
a
hoarse
cry
he
dashed
forward
he
would
destroy
this
pig
who
chucked
his
jeanne
under
the
chin
the
first
intimation
bredin
had
of
the
declaration
of
war
was
the
impact
of
a
french
roll
on
his
ear
it
was
one
of
those
nobbly
chunky
rolls
with
sharp
corners
almost
as
deadly
as
a
piece
of
shrapnel
bredin
was
incapable
of
jumping
but
he
uttered
a
howl
and
his
vast
body
quivered
like
a
stricken
jelly
a
second
roll
whizzing
by
slapped
against
the
wall
a
moment
later
a
burst
in
sticky
ruin
on
the
proprietor
left
eye
the
belated
luncher
had
been
anxious
to
pay
his
bill
and
go
but
he
came
swiftly
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
worth
stopping
on
for
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
watched
bredin
had
entrenched
himself
behind
the
peering
nervously
at
paul
through
the
cream
and
paul
pouring
forth
abuse
in
his
native
tongue
was
brandishing
a
chocolate
eclair
the
situation
looked
good
to
the
spectator
it
was
spoiled
by
jeanne
who
seized
paul
by
the
arm
and
shook
him
adding
her
own
voice
to
the
babel
it
was
enough
the
eclair
fell
to
the
floor
paul
voice
died
away
his
face
took
on
again
its
crushed
hunted
expression
the
voice
of
bredin
freed
from
competition
rose
shrill
and
wrathful
marksman
is
getting
sacked
mused
the
onlooker
diagnosing
the
situation
he
was
right
the
next
moment
paul
limp
and
depressed
had
retired
to
the
kitchen
passage
discharged
it
was
here
after
a
few
minutes
that
jeanne
found
him
idiot
imbecile
said
jeanne
paul
stared
at
her
without
speaking
throw
rolls
at
the
imbecile
began
paul
and
what
if
he
did
must
you
then
attack
him
like
a
mad
dog
what
is
it
to
you
paul
was
conscious
of
a
dull
longing
for
sympathy
a
monstrous
sense
of
oppression
everything
was
going
wrong
surely
jeanne
must
be
touched
by
his
heroism
but
no
she
was
scolding
furiously
suppose
andromeda
had
turned
and
scolded
perseus
after
he
had
slain
the
paul
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
napkin
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
his
world
do
not
talk
to
me
idiot
of
a
little
man
almost
you
lost
me
my
place
also
the
was
in
two
minds
but
i
coaxed
him
a
fine
thing
that
would
have
been
to
lose
my
good
place
through
your
foolishness
to
throw
rolls
my
goodness
she
swept
back
into
the
room
again
leaving
paul
still
standing
by
the
kitchen
door
something
seemed
to
have
snapped
inside
him
how
long
he
stood
there
he
did
not
know
but
presently
from
the
came
calls
of
and
automatically
he
fell
once
more
into
his
work
as
an
actor
takes
up
his
part
a
stranger
would
have
noticed
nothing
remarkable
in
him
he
bustled
to
and
fro
with
undiminished
energy
at
the
end
of
the
day
bredin
paid
him
his
eighteen
shillings
with
a
grunt
and
paul
walked
out
of
the
restaurant
a
masterless
man
he
went
to
his
attic
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
propped
up
against
the
wall
was
the
picture
he
looked
at
it
with
unseeing
eyes
he
stared
dully
before
him
then
thoughts
came
to
him
with
a
rush
leaping
and
dancing
in
his
mind
like
imps
in
hades
he
had
a
curious
sense
of
detachment
he
seemed
to
be
watching
himself
from
a
great
distance
this
was
the
end
the
little
imps
danced
and
leaped
and
then
one
separated
itself
from
the
crowd
to
grow
bigger
than
the
rest
to
pirouette
more
energetically
he
rose
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
kill
himself
he
went
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
he
thought
hard
as
he
walked
he
would
kill
himself
but
how
his
preoccupation
was
so
great
that
an
automobile
rounding
a
corner
missed
him
by
inches
as
he
crossed
the
road
the
chauffeur
shouted
angrily
at
him
as
he
leapt
back
paul
shook
his
fist
at
the
retreating
lights
he
shouted
scoundrel
villain
would
you
kill
me
i
will
take
your
number
rascal
i
will
inform
the
police
villain
a
policeman
had
strolled
up
and
was
eyeing
him
curiously
paul
turned
to
him
full
of
his
wrongs
he
cried
have
a
complaint
these
pigs
of
chauffeurs
they
are
reckless
they
drive
so
recklessly
hence
the
great
number
of
accidents
said
the
policeman
along
sonny
paul
walked
on
fuming
it
was
abominable
that
these
chauffeurs
and
then
an
idea
came
to
him
he
had
found
a
way
it
was
quiet
in
the
park
he
had
chosen
the
park
because
it
was
dark
and
there
would
be
none
to
see
and
interfere
he
waited
long
in
the
shadow
by
the
roadside
presently
from
the
darkness
there
came
the
distant
drone
of
powerful
engines
lights
appeared
like
the
blazing
eyes
of
a
dragon
swooping
down
to
devour
its
prey
he
ran
out
into
the
road
with
a
shout
it
was
an
error
that
shout
he
had
intended
it
for
an
inarticulate
farewell
to
his
picture
to
jeanne
to
life
it
was
excusable
to
the
driver
of
the
motor
that
he
misinterpreted
it
it
seemed
to
him
a
cry
of
warning
there
was
a
great
jarring
of
brakes
a
scuttering
of
locked
wheels
on
the
dry
road
and
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
a
full
yard
from
where
he
stood
the
deuce
said
a
cool
voice
from
behind
the
lights
paul
struck
his
chest
and
folded
his
arms
am
here
he
cried
me
george
do
it
said
the
voice
in
a
marked
american
accent
never
murder
on
a
friday
it
unlucky
if
it
not
a
rude
question
which
asylum
are
you
from
halloa
the
exclamation
was
one
of
surprise
for
paul
nerves
had
finally
given
way
and
he
was
now
in
a
heap
on
the
road
sobbing
the
man
climbed
down
and
came
into
the
light
he
was
a
tall
young
man
with
a
pleasant
face
he
stopped
and
shook
paul
that
he
said
it
not
true
and
if
it
is
always
hope
cut
it
out
what
the
matter
all
in
paul
sat
up
gulping
convulsively
he
was
thoroughly
unstrung
the
cold
desperate
mood
had
passed
in
its
place
came
the
old
feeling
of
desolation
he
was
a
child
aching
for
sympathy
he
wanted
to
tell
his
troubles
punctuating
his
narrative
with
many
gestures
and
an
occasional
gulp
he
proceeded
to
do
so
the
american
listened
attentively
you
ca
sell
your
picture
and
you
lost
your
job
and
your
girl
has
shaken
you
he
said
bad
but
still
you
no
call
to
go
mingling
with
automobile
wheels
you
come
along
with
me
to
my
hotel
and
tomorrow
we
see
if
we
ca
fix
up
something
there
was
breakfast
at
the
hotel
next
morning
a
breakfast
to
put
heart
into
a
man
during
the
meal
a
messenger
dispatched
in
a
cab
to
lodgings
returned
with
the
canvas
a
deferential
waiter
informed
the
american
that
it
had
been
taken
with
every
possible
care
to
his
suite
said
the
young
man
you
through
we
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
they
went
upstairs
there
was
the
picture
resting
against
a

now
if

fellow

wearing
braces
and
stooped
like
that
you
say
he
burst
those
braces

you
with
a
somewhat
dazed
air
paul
said
that

thought
he
would
till
now

had
not
looked
at
the
figure
from
just
that
say

extreme
fervour
on

at
about
five
minutes
after
one
that
afternoon
that
constable
thomas

patrolling

was
aware
of
a
man
motioning
to
him
from
the
doorway
of

parisian
cafe
and

the
man
looked
like
a
pig
he
grunted
like
a
pig
he
had
the
lavish
of
a
pig
constable
parsons
suspected
that
he
had
a
porcine
soul
indeed
the
thought
flitted
across
constable
mind
that
if
he
were
to
tie
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
round
his
neck
he
could
win
prizes
with
him
at
a
show

inquired

stout
man

volubly
in
french
constable
parsons
shook
his
head

the
stout
man
pointing
behind

into

with
massive
dignity
the
policeman
entered
the
restaurant
at
one
of
the
tables
sat
paul
calm
and
distrait
from
across
the
room
jeanne
stared
freezingly
all
this
inquired
constable
parsons
paul
looked
up
too
he
admitted

not

the
policeman
eyed
paul
sternly
he
said
so

along
paul
eyebrows
rose
before
the
round
eyes
of
bredin
he
began
to
produce
from
his
pockets
and
to
lay
upon
the
table
and
sovereigns
the
cloth
was
covered
with
them
he
picked
up
a
monsieur
he
said
to
the
policeman
accept
this
as
a
slight
consolation
for
the
inconvenience
which
this
foolish
person
here
has
caused
him
half
said
mr
parsons
affably
here
he
turned
to
the
gaping
proprietor
you
go
on
like
this
you
be
getting
yourself
into
trouble
see
you
take
care
another
time
paul
called
for
the
bill
of
fare
it
was
the
inferior
person
who
had
succeeded
to
his
place
as
waiter
who
attended
to
his
needs
during
the
meal
but
when
he
had
lunched
it
was
jeanne
who
brought
his
coffee
she
bent
over
the
table
sold
your
picture
paul
yes
she
whispered
much
money
how
glad
i
am
dear
paul
now
we
will
paul
met
her
glance
coolly
you
be
so
kind
he
said
to
bring
me
also
a
cigarette
my
good
girl
the
man
who
disliked
cats
it
was
harold
who
first
made
us
acquainted
when
i
was
dining
one
night
at
the
cafe
britannique
in
soho
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
cafe
britannique
that
you
will
always
find
flies
there
even
in
winter
snow
was
falling
that
night
as
i
turned
in
at
the
door
but
glancing
about
me
i
noticed
several
of
the
old
faces
my
old
acquaintance
percy
the
bluebottle
looking
wonderfully
fit
despite
his
years
was
doing
deep
breathing
exercises
on
a
mutton
cutlet
and
was
too
busy
to
do
more
than
pause
for
a
moment
to
nod
at
me
but
his
cousin
harold
always
active
sighted
me
and
bustled
up
to
do
the
honours
he
had
finished
his
game
of
with
my
right
ear
and
was
circling
slowly
in
the
air
while
he
thought
out
other
ways
of
entertaining
me
when
there
was
a
rush
of
air
a
swish
of
napkin
and
no
more
harold
i
turned
to
thank
my
preserver
whose
table
adjoined
mine
he
was
a
frenchman
a
man
he
had
the
appearance
of
one
who
has
searched
for
the
leak
in
life
with
a
lighted
candle
of
one
whom
the
clenched
fist
of
fate
has
smitten
beneath
the
temperamental
third
he
waved
my
thanks
aside
was
a
bagatelle
he
said
we
became
friendly
he
moved
to
my
table
and
we
fraternized
over
our
coffee
suddenly
he
became
agitated
he
kicked
at
something
on
the
floor
his
eyes
gleamed
angrily
he
hissed
i
looked
round
the
corner
of
the
table
and
perceived
the
restaurant
cat
in
dignified
retreat
do
not
like
cats
i
said
all
animals

he
frowned

seemed
to
hesitate

tell
you
my
story

said

sympathize

a
sympathetic
face
it
is
the
story
of
a
man
tragedy
it
is
the
story
of
a
blighted
life
it
is
the
story
of
a
woman
who
would
not
forgive

is
the
story

appointment

at
his
cigarette

artist
instinct
for

paused
he
looked
round
the
restaurant

every
side

the
clatter
of
knife
and
fork
and
the
clear
sharp
note
of
those
who
drank
soup
in
a
distant
corner
a
small
waiter
with
a
large
voice
was
calling
the
cook
names

a
cheerful
scene

which
spoken
these
words
she
has
looked
at
me
i
looked
at
her
i
forget
everything
but
that
she
is
adorable
i
forget
those
who
stand
by
i
forget
that
the
parrot
has
bitten
me
in
the
i
forget
even
that
i
am
standing
there
in
pyjamas
with
on
my
feet
nothing
i
can
only
gaze
at
her
and
worship
i
have
found
words
i
have
said
am
rejoiced
that
i
have
been
the
means
of
restoring
to
you
your
bird
she
has
thanked
me
with
her
eyes
and
then
with
words
also
i
am
bewitched
she
is
divine
i
care
not
that
my
feet
are
cold
i
could
wish
to
stand
there
talking
all
night
she
has
given
a
cry
of
dismay
it
is
wounded
i
look
at
my
yes
it
is
bleeding
where
the
bird
bitten
it
mademoiselle
i
have
said
is
a
bagatelle
but
no
she
is
distressed
she
is
what
your
poet
scott
said
a
ministering
angel
thou
she
torn
her
and
is
binding
up
my
wound
i
am
enchanted
such
beauty
such
kindness
can
i
resist
to
fall
on
my
knees
before
and
declare
my
passion
we
are
twin
souls
she
has
thanked
me
again
she
has
scolded
the
parrot
she
has
smiled
upon
me
as
she
retires
to
her
room
it
is
enough
nothing
is
said
but
i
am
a
man
of
sensibility
and
discernment
and
i
understand
that
she
will
not
be
offended
if
i
seek
to
renew
our
friendship
on
a
more
suitable
occasion
the
doors
shut
the
guests
have
returned
to
bed
the
hotel
servants
to
their
duties
and
i
go
back
to
my
room
but
not
to
sleep
it
is
very
late
but
i
do
not
sleep
i
lie
awake
and
think
of
you
will
conceive
monsieur

what
mixed
feelings
i
descend
next
morning
on
the
one
i
must
keep
the
sharp
for
my
uncle

must
avoid

shall
have
what

say
in
your
idiom

have
it
simmered
down
and
tucked
in
his
shirt
on
the
other
i
must
watch
for
my
lady
of
the
parrot
i
count
the
minutes
till
we
shall
meet
again
i
avoid
my
uncle
with
success
and
i
see
about
the
hour
of
she
is
talking
to
old
gentleman
i
have
bowed
she
have
smiled
and
motioned
me
to
approach

has
said

the
gentleman

have
shaken
hands

observed
my
despair

my
chagrin
to
visit
them
in
london
is
the
one
thing
i
desire
to
do
but
how
i
accept
gratefully

how
it
is
to
be
done

am
poor
blighter
with
no
profession
and
nine
francs
he
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
am
wealthy
what
shall
i
do

spend
the
afternoon

to
form
a
plan
and
then
i
am
resolved

will
go
to
my
uncle

the
magnificent
chance
to
marry
the
daughter
of
wealthy
english
landowner

me
one
more
chance

decent
old
buck
and
put
up
the
money
for
this
affair
these
words
i
have
resolved
to
say
to
my
uncle
i
go
back
to
the
hotel
i
enter
his
private
office
i
reveal
no
secret
when
i
say
that
he
is
not
cordial
thousand
devils
he
has
cried
do
you
here
i
to
tell
him
all
and
plead
with
him
to
be
decent
old
buck
he
does
not
believe
who
is
he
he
asks
this
english
landowner
how
did
i
meet
him
and
where
i
tell
him
he
is
amazed
the
infernal
impudence
to
take
room
in
my
hotel
he
has
cried
i
am
crafty
i
am
diplomat
else
dear
uncle
i
say
all
paris
there
is
no
such
from
the
cuisine
marvellous
the
beds
of
the
attendance
superb
if
only
for
one
night
i
have
said
to
myself
i
must
stay
in
this
of
all
hotels
i
what
do
you
say
touched
the
spot
what
you
say
he
has
said
more
calmly
is
certainly
something
it
is
a
good
hotel
this
of
mine
the
only
hotel
i
have
assured
him
the
meurice
i
snap
my
fingers
the
ritz
bah
once
again
i
snap
my
fingers
all
paris
there
is
no
hotel
like
this
he
simmered
down
his
shirt
is
tucked
in
me
again
this
plan
of
yours
jean
when
i
leave
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
it
is
agreed
between
us
that
i
am
to
one
last
chance
he
will
not
spoil
this
promising
ship
for
the
of
tar
he
will
give
me
money
for
my
purpose
but
he
has
said
as
we
part
if
i
fail
his
shall
be
washed
of
me
he
can
not
now
forget
that
i
am
his
dear
brother
child
but
if
i
fail
to
accomplish
the
conquest
of
the
divine
miss
marion
he
thinks
he
will
be
able
to
it
is
well
a
week
later
i
follow
the
to
london
for
the
next
few
days
monsieur
i
am
in
paradise
my
has
much
nice
in
eaton
square
he
is
rich
popular
there
is
much
society
and
i
i
have
the
i
am
young
debonair
i
can
not
speak
the
english
very
well
not
so
well
as
i
now
speak
but
i
manage
i
get
along
i
am
intelligent
amiable
everyone
loves
me
no
not
everyone
captain
bassett
he
does
not
love
me
and
why
because
he
loves
the
charming
miss
marion
and
observes
that
already
i
am
succeeding
with
her
like
a
on
fire
he
is
de
he
is
captain
in
your
garde
ecossais
and
my
told
me
has
distinguished
himself
as
soldier
pretty
much
it
may
be
so
as
soldier
but
at
conversation
he
is
not
so
good
he
is
quite
nice
fellow
you
understand
yes
distinguished
yes
but
he
does
not
sparkle
he
has
not
my
my
i
how
do
you
say
i
make
the
rings
round
him
but
at
that
moment
i
would
have
made
the
rings
round
the
british
army
yes
and
also
the
corps
diplomatique
for
i
am
inspired
love
inspired
me
i
am
conqueror
but
i
will
not
weary
you
monsieur
with
the
details
of
my
wooing
you
are
sympathetic
but
i
must
not
weary
you
let
us
say
that
i
in
four
days
or
five
made
progress
the
most
remarkable
and
proceed
to
the
tragic
end
almost
could
i
tell
it
in
four
words
in
them
one
would
say
that
it
is
set
forth
there
was
in
london
at
that
time
popular
a
song
a
comic
vulgar
song
of
the
cat
came
back
you
it
yes
i
it
myself
and
without
emotion
it
had
no
sinister
warning
for
me
it
did
not
strike
me
as
omen
yet
in
those
four
words
monsieur
is
my
tragedy
how
i
shall
tell
you
every
word
is
a
sword
twisted
in
my
but
i
shall
tell
you
one
afternoon
we
are
at
tea
all
is
well
i
am
vivacious
gay
miss
marion
charming
gracious
there
is
present
also
an
aunt
mr
sister
but
i
do
not
much
notice
it
is
to
marion
i
speak
both
with
my
lips
and
also
with
my
eyes
as
we
sit
captain
bassett
is
announced
he
has
entered
we
have
greeted
each
other
politely
but
coldly
for
we
are
rivals
there
is
in
his
manner
also
a
something
which
i
do
not
much
like
a
species
of
suppressed
triumph
of
elation
i
am
uneasy
but
only
yet
vaguely
you
will
understand
i
have
not
the
foreboding
that
he
is
about
to
speak
my
he
addresses
miss
marion
there
is
joy
in
his
voice
he
has
said
have
for
you
the
bally
good
news
you
will
remember
is
it
the
cat
belonging
to
the
american
woman
in
the
hotel
at
paris
of
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
last
night
at
dinner
i
have
been
seated
beside
her
at
first
i
am
not
certain
is
it
she
then
i
say
that
there
can
not
be
two
mrs
balderstone
rockmettlers
in
europe
so
i
mention
to
her
the
cat
and
to
cut
the
long
story
short
i
have
ventured
to
purchase
for
you
as
a
little
present
the
cat
alexander
i
have
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
but
it
is
not
because
of
miss
marion
cry
of
joy
captain
bassett
she
has
said
very
splendid
of
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
him
have
i
loved
alexander
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
but
it
amazes
me
that
you
should
have
been
able
to
induce
her
to
part
with
in
paris
she
has
refused
all
my
offers
he
has
paused
embarrassed
fact
is
he
has
said
is
between
her
and
alexander
a
certain
coolness
he
deceived
and
she
loves
him
no
more
immediately
upon
arrival
in
london
he
had
the
misfortune
to
six
fine
kittens
out
of
evil
cometh
good
and
i
have
thus
been
able
to
secure
for
you
is
downstairs
in
a
basket
miss
marion
rung
the
bell
and
commanded
for
him
to
be
brought
instantly
i
will
not
describe
the
meeting
monsieur
you
are
sympathetic
you
will
understand
my
feelings
let
us
on
figure
yourself
monsieur
to
what
extent
i
was
now
i
am
artist
i
am
a
man
of
nerves
i
can
not
be
gay
brilliant
debonair
in
the
presence
of
a
cat
yet
always
the
cat
is
there
it
is
terrible
i
feel
that
i
am
falling
behind
in
the
race
gratitude
has
made
her
the
more
gracious
to
captain
bassett
she
smiles
upon
him
and
like
chanticleer
at
the
sight
of
the
sun
he
flaps
his
wings
and
crows
he
is
no
longer
the
silent
listener
it
is
i
who
have
become
the
silent
listener
i
have
said
to
myself
that
something
must
be
done
chance
has
shown
me
the
way
one
afternoon
i
am
by
fortune
alone
in
the
in
his
cage
the
parrot
polly
is
i
address
him
through
the
bars
and
i
shoot
i
he
has
cried
the
tears
have
filled
my
eyes
it
has
brought
the
scene
back
to
me
as
i
weep
i
perceive
the
cat
alexander
approaching
i
have
formed
a
plan
i
have
opened
the
and
released
the
parrot
the
cat
i
think
will
attack
the
parrot
of
which
miss
is
so
fond
she
will
love
him
no
more
he
will
be
expelled
he
paused
i
suppose
my
face
must
have
lost
some
of
its
alleged
sympathy
as
he
set
forth
this
fiendish
plot
even
percy
the
bluebottle
seemed
shocked
he
had
settled
on
the
but
at
these
words
he
rose
in
a
marked
manner
and
left
the
table
do
not
approve
he
said
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
no
business
of
mine
i
said
do
you
think
yourself
it
was
playing
it
a
bit
low
down
did
the
thought
present
itself
to
you
in
a
shadowy
way
that
it
was
rather
rough
on
the
bird
did
monsieur
but
what
would
you
it
is
necessary
to
break
eggs
in
order
to
make
an
omelette
all
is
fair
you
say
in
love
and
war
and
this
was
both
moreover
you
must
understand
i
do
not
dictate
his
movements
to
the
parrot
he
is
free
agent
i
do
but
open
the
should
he
out
and
proceed
to
the
floor
where
is
the
cat
that
is
his
affair
i
shall
continue
yes
i
open
the
and
disappear
discreetly
it
is
not
politic
that
i
remain
to
witness
what
shall
transpire
it
is
for
me
to
establish
an
alibi
i
go
to
the
where
i
remain
at
dinner
that
night
mr
has
laughed
the
this
afternoon
he
has
said
have
seen
by
chance
the
dickens
of
a
funny
occurrence
that
parrot
of
yours
marion
had
escaped
once
again
from
its
cage
and
was
an
argument
with
that
cat
which
captain
bassett
has
given
to
you
i
hope
that
alexander
not
hurt
poor
polly
of
whom
i
am
very
fond
she
has
said
affair
did
not
come
to
blows
has
said
mr
may
trust
that
bird
to
take
care
of
himself
my
dear
when
i
came
upon
the
scene
the
cat
was
crouching
in
a
corner
with
his
fur
bristling
and
his
back
up
while
polly
standing
before
was
telling
not
to
move
or
he
would
shoot
nor
did
he
move
till
i
seized
the
parrot
and
replaced
him
in
the
cage
when
he
shot
upstairs
like
a
streak
of
lightning
by
sheer
force
of
character
that
excellent
bird
won
the
bloodless
victory
i
drink
to
you
can
conceive
my
emotion
as
i
listen
to
this
tale
i
am
like
the
poet
mice
and
men
whose
schemes
have
gone
away
i
am
baffled
i
am
discouraged
i
do
not
know
what
i
shall
do
i
must
find
another
plan
but
i
do
not
know
what
how
shall
i
remove
the
cat
shall
i
kill
no
for
i
might
be
suspect
shall
i
someone
to
steal
no
for
my
accomplice
might
betray
me
shall
i
myself
steal
ah
that
is
better
that
is
a
very
good
plan
soon
i
have
it
perfected
this
plan
listen
monsieur
it
is
as
follows
it
is
simple
but
it
is
good
i
will
await
my
opportunity
i
will
remove
the
cat
secretly

the

will
take
him
to
an
office

order
a
messenger
to
carry
him
at
once
to
the
cats
house
and

is
either
lost
alexander
or
his
living
image
exactly
is
he
the
same
to
all
appearances
as
the
lost
alexander
but
there
is
when
i
try
to
purchase
some
curious
which
they
do
not
explain
they
must
time
they
say
to
consider
they
can
not
at
once
decide
what
nonsense

a
to
the
cats
house

is
courteous
and
sympathetic
he
has
introduced
us
to
the
cat
and
my
turned
to
water
for
it
is
alexander
why
has
he
not
been
destroyed
the
is
speaking
i
him
in
a
dream
you
identify
as
your
cat
miss
he
has
said
matter
is
ended
my
when
you
sir
approached
me
this
morning
on
the
matter
was
due
to
the
fact
that
a
messenger
was
sent
with
instructions
that
he
be
destroyed
at
once
rough
was
it
that
on
the
messenger
yes
captain
bassett
has
said
he
is
facetious
you
understand
for
he
is
conqueror
i
am
silent
i
am
not
facetious
for
already
i
feel
how
do
you
say
my
fowl
is
cooked
the
messenger
sir
the
has
said
misunderstood
me
it
was
the
cat
which
was
to
be
destroyed
as
per
instructions
of
the
anonymous
sender
could
have
played
such
a
wicked
trick
miss
marion
has
asked
indignant
the
has
stooped
and
from
behind
a
table
he
has
brought
a
this
he
has
said
above
animal
was
conveyed
but
with
it
was
no
accompanying
letter
the
sender
was
anonymous
captain
bassett
has
said
and
still
more
in
a
dream
i
him
on
the
there
is
some
bally
name
or
other
do
you
not
know
what
i
clutch
at
the
table
the
room
is
spinning
round
and
round
i
have
no
stomach
only
emptiness
bless
me
the
has
said
quite
right
sir
so
there
is
funny
of
me
not
to
have
before
observed
it
there
is
a
name
and
also
an
address
it
is
the
name
of
jean
priaulx
and
the
address
is
the
hotel
jules
priaulx
paris
my
companion
stopped
abruptly
he
passed
a
handkerchief
over
his
forehead
with
a
quick
movement
he
reached
for
his
glass
of
liqueur
brandy
and
drained
it
at
a
gulp
he
said
will
not
wish
me
to
describe
the
scene
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
be
zolaesque
you
can
imagine
chucked
you
in
moments
of
emotion
it
is
the
simplest
language
that
comes
to
the
lips
he
nodded
married
captain
bassett
he
nodded
again
your
uncle
i
said
did
he
take
it
he
sighed
was
once
more
he
said
row
monsieur
washed
his
hands
of
you
altogether
he
was
angry
but
he
gave
me
one
more
chance
i
am
still
dear
brother
child
and
he
can
not
forget
it
an
acquaintance
of
his
a
man
of
letters
a
paul
sartines
was
in
need
of
a
secretary
the
post
was
not
well
paid
but
it
was
permanent
my
uncle
insist
that
i
take
it
what
choice
i
took
it
it
is
the
post
which
i
still
he
ordered
another
liqueur
brandy
and
gulped
it
down
name
is
familiar
to
you
monsieur
you
of
m
sartines
do
think
i
have
who
is
he
is
a
man
of
letters
a
for
five
years
he
has
been
occupied
upon
a
great
work
it
is
with
that
that
i
assist
him
by
collecting
facts
for
use
i
spent
this
afternoon
in
the
british
museum
collecting
facts
tomorrow
i
go
again
and
the
next
day
and
again
after
that
the
book
will
occupy
yet
another
ten
years
before
it
is
completed
it
is
his
great
work
sounds
as
if
it
was
i
said
it
about
he
signalled
to
the
waiter
one
other
liqueur
brandy
the
book
monsieur
is
a
of
the
cat
in
ancient
ruth
in
exile
the
clock
struck
five
briskly
as
if
time
were
money
ruth
warden
got
up
from
her
desk
and
having
put
on
her
hat
emerged
into
the
outer
office
where
gandinot
received
visitors
gandinot
the
ugliest
man
in
presided
over
the
local
and
ruth
served
him
from
ten
to
five
as
a
sort
of
her
duties
if
monotonous
were
simple
they
consisted
of
sitting
detached
and
invisible
behind
a
screen
and
entering
details
of
loans
in
a
fat
book
she
was
kept
busy
as
a
rule
for
roville
possesses
two
casinos
each
offering
the
attraction
of
and
just
round
the
corner
is
monte
carlo
very
brisk
was
the
business
done
by
gandinot
the
pawnbroker
and
very
frequent
were
the
pitying
shakes
of
the
head
and
clicks
of
the
tongue
of
gandinot
the
man
for
in
his
unofficial
capacity
ruth
employer
had
a
gentle
soul
and
winced
at
the
evidences
of
tragedy
which
presented
themselves
before
his
official
eyes
he
blinked
up
at
ruth
as
she
appeared
and
ruth
as
she
looked
at
him
was
conscious
as
usual
of
a
lightening
of
the
depression
which
nowadays
seemed
to
have
settled
permanently
upon
her
the
peculiar
quality
of
gandinot
extraordinary
countenance
was
that
it
induced
mirth
not
mocking
laughter
but
a
kind
of
smiling
happiness
it
possessed
that
indefinable
quality
which
characterizes
the
billiken
due
perhaps
to
the
unquenchable
optimism
which
shone
through
the
irregular
features
for
gandinot
despite
his
calling
believed
in
his
are
going
mademoiselle
as
ruth
was
wearing
her
hat
and
making
for
the
door
and
as
she
always
left
at
this
hour
a
purist
might
have
considered
the
question
superfluous
but
gandinot
was
a
man
who
seized
every
opportunity
of
practising
his
english
will
not
wait
for
the
good
papa
who
calls
so
regularly
for
you
think
i
wo
today
gandinot
i
want
to
get
out
into
the
air
i
have
rather
a
headache
will
you
tell
my
father
i
have
gone
to
the
promenade
gandinot
sighed
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
ruth
depression
had
not
escaped
his
notice
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
not
without
cause
for
fate
had
not
dealt
too
kindly
with
ruth
it
would
have
amazed
mr
eugene
warden
that
genial
old
gentleman
if
on
one
of
those
occasions
of
manly
emotion
when
he
was
in
the
habit
of
observing
that
he
had
been
nobody
enemy
but
his
own
somebody
had
hinted
that
he
had
spoiled
his
daughter
life
such
a
thought
had
never
entered
his
head
he
was
one
of
those
delightful
irresponsible
erratic
persons
whose
heads
thoughts
of
this
kind
do
not
enter
and
who
are
about
as
deadly
to
those
whose
lives
are
bound
up
with
theirs
as
a
upas
tree
in
the
memory
of
his
oldest
acquaintance
ruth
father
had
never
done
anything
but
drift
amiably
through
life
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
had
done
his
drifting
in
london
feeding
cheerfully
from
the
hand
of
a
but
though
blood
as
he
was
wont
to
remark
while
negotiating
his
periodical
loans
is
thicker
than
water
a
affection
has
its
limits
a
day
came
when
mr
warden
observed
with
pain
that
his
relative
responded
less
nimbly
to
the
touch
and
a
little
while
later
the
other
delivered
his
ultimatum
mr
warden
was
to
leave
england
and
to
stay
away
from
england
to
behave
as
if
england
no
longer
existed
on
the
map
and
a
small
but
sufficient
allowance
would
be
made
to
him
if
he
declined
to
do
this
not
another
penny
of
the
speaker
money
would
he
receive
he
could
choose
he
chose
he
left
england
ruth
with
him
they
settled
in
roville
that
haven
of
the
exile
who
lives
upon
remittances
ruth
connexion
with
the
had
come
about
almost
automatically
very
soon
after
their
arrival
it
became
evident
that
to
a
man
of
mr
warden
nature
resident
a
distant
from
two
casinos
the
small
allowance
was
not
likely
to
go
very
far
even
if
ruth
had
not
wished
to
work
circumstances
could
have
compelled
her
as
it
was
she
longed
for
something
to
occupy
her
and
the
vacancy
at
the
occurring
she
had
snatched
at
it
there
was
a
certain
fitness
in
her
working
there
business
transactions
with
that
useful
institution
had
always
been
conducted
by
her
it
being
mr
warden
theory
that
woman
can
extract
in
these
crises
just
that
extra
franc
or
two
which
is
denied
to
the
mere
male
through
constantly
going
round
running
across
stepping
over
and
popping
down
to
the
she
had
established
almost
a
legal
claim
on
any
post
that
might
be
vacant
there
and
under
gandinot
banner
she
had
served
ever
since
five
minutes
walk
took
her
to
the
promenade
des
anglais
that
apparently
endless
thoroughfare
which
is
roville
pride
the
evening
was
fine
and
warm
the
sun
shone
gaily
on
the
houses
the
bright
gardens
and
the
two
gleaming
casinos
but
ruth
walked
listlessly
blind
to
the
glitter
of
it
all
visitors
who
go
to
roville
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
winter
are
apt
to
speak
of
the
place
on
their
return
in
a
manner
that
conveys
the
impression
that
it
is
a
paradise
on
earth
with
gambling
facilities
thrown
in
but
then
they
are
visitors
their
sojourn
comes
to
an
end
ruth
did
not
a
voice
spoke
her
name
she
turned
and
saw
her
father
dapper
as
ever
standing
beside
her
an
evening
my
dear
said
mr
warden
an
evening
smell
the
sea
mr
warden
appeared
to
be
in
high
spirits
he
hummed
a
tune
and
twirled
his
cane
he
chirruped
frequently
to
bill
the
companion
of
his
walks
abroad
a
wiry
of
a
demeanour
like
his
master
both
jaunty
and
slightly
disreputable
an
air
of
gaiety
pervaded
his
bearing
called
in
at
the
but
you
had
gone
gandinot
told
me
you
had
come
here
what
an
ugly
fellow
that
gandinot
is
but
a
good
sort
i
like
him
i
had
a
chat
with
him
the
high
spirits
were
explained
ruth
knew
her
father
she
guessed
correctly
that
gandinot
kindest
of
pawnbrokers
had
obliged
in
his
unofficial
capacity
with
a
trifling
loan
ought
to
go
on
the
stage
went
on
mr
warden
pursuing
his
theme
that
face
he
would
make
his
fortune
you
ca
help
laughing
when
you
see
it
one
of
these
days
he
broke
off
stirring
things
had
begun
to
occur
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
ankles
where
bill
the
had
encountered
an
acquaintance
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
loud
gargling
noise
was
endeavouring
to
bite
his
head
off
the
acquaintance
a
gentleman
of
uncertain
breed
equally
willing
was
chewing
bill
paw
with
the
gusto
of
a
gourmet
an
irish
terrier
with
no
personal
bias
towards
either
side
was
dancing
round
and
attacking
each
in
turn
as
he
came
uppermost
and
two
poodles
leaped
madly
in
and
out
of
the
melee
barking
encouragement
it
takes
a
better
man
than
mr
warden
to
break
up
a
gathering
of
this
kind
the
old
gentleman
was
bewildered
he
added
his
voice
to
the
babel
and
twice
smote
bill
grievously
with
his
cane
with
blows
intended
for
the
acquaintance
but
beyond
that
he
effected
nothing
it
seemed
probable
that
the
engagement
would
last
till
the
combatants
had
consumed
each
other
after
the
fashion
of
the
kilkenny
cats
when
there
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
a
young
man
in
grey
the
world
is
divided
into
those
who
can
stop
and
those
who
can
not
the
young
man
in
grey
belonged
to
the
former
class
within
a
minute
from
his
entrance
on
the
scene
the
poodles
and
the
irish
terrier
had
vanished
the
dog
of
doubtful
breed
was
moving
off
up
the
hill
yelping
with
the
dispatch
of
one
who
remembers
an
important
appointment
and
bill
miraculously
calmed
was
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
promenade
licking
honourable
wounds
mr
warden
was
disposed
to
effervesce
with
gratitude
the
scene
had
shaken
him
and
there
had
been
moments
when
he
had
given
his
ankles
up
for
lost
mention
it
said
the
young
man
enjoy
arbitrating
in
these
little
disputes
dogs
seem
to
like
me
and
trust
my
judgement
i
consider
myself
as
a
sort
of
honorary
dog
i
am
bound
to
say
mr
george
vince
name
is
warden
my
daughter
ruth
inclined
her
head
and
was
conscious
of
a
pair
of
very
penetrating
brown
eyes
looking
eagerly
into
hers
in
a
manner
which
she
thoroughly
resented
she
was
not
used
to
the
other
sex
meeting
her
gaze
and
holding
it
as
if
confident
of
a
friendly
welcome
she
made
up
her
mind
in
that
instant
that
this
was
a
young
man
who
required
suppression
seen
you
several
times
out
here
since
i
arrived
miss
warden
said
mr
vince
in
all
he
added
precisely
said
ruth
she
looked
away
her
attitude
seemed
to
suggest
that
she
had
finished
with
him
and
would
be
obliged
if
somebody
would
come
and
sweep
him
up
as
they
approached
the
casino
restlessness
crept
into
mr
manner
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
looked
at
ruth
think
my
dear
he
said
to
have
a
dash
at
the
chevaux
inquired
mr
vince
was
there
just
now
i
have
an
infallible
system
mr
warden
started
like
a
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
it
infallible
the
wrong
way
went
on
the
young
man
i
wish
you
luck
i
see
miss
warden
home
do
trouble
said
ruth
in
the
haughty
manner
which
had
frequently
withered
unfortunate
in
their
tracks
it
had
no
such
effect
on
mr
vince
shall
like
it
he
said
ruth
set
her
teeth
she
would
see
whether
he
would
like
it
they
left
mr
warden
who
shot
in
at
the
casino
door
like
a
homing
rabbit
and
walked
on
in
silence
which
lasted
till
ruth
suddenly
becoming
aware
that
her
companion
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
face
turned
her
head
to
meet
a
gaze
of
complete
not
to
say
loving
admiration
she
flushed
she
was
accustomed
to
being
looked
at
admiringly
but
about
this
particular
look
there
was
a
subtle
quality
that
distinguished
it
from
the
ordinary
something
proprietorial
mr
vince
appeared
to
be
a
young
man
who
wasted
no
time
on
conventional
you
believe
in
affinities
miss
warden
he
said
said
ruth
will
before
we
done
said
mr
vince
confidently
did
you
try
to
snub
me
just
now
i
must
again
it
hurts
me
i
a
sensitive
man
diffident
shy
miss
warden
will
you
marry
me
ruth
had
determined
that
nothing
should
shake
her
from
her
icy
detachment
but
this
did
she
stopped
with
a
gasp
and
stared
at
him
mr
vince
reassured
her
do
expect
you
to
say
yes
that
was
just
a
beginning
the
shot
fired
across
the
bows
by
way
of
warning
in
you
miss
warden
i
have
found
my
affinity
have
you
ever
considered
this
matter
of
affinities
affinities
are
the
the
wait
a
moment
he
paused
reflecting
began
ruth
said
the
young
man
holding
up
his
hand
ruth
eyes
flashed
she
was
not
used
to
having
said
to
her
by
young
men
and
she
resented
it
got
it
he
declared
with
relief
knew
i
should
but
these
good
things
take
time
affinities
are
the
zero
on
the
of
life
just
as
we
select
a
number
on
which
to
stake
our
money
so
do
we
select
a
type
of
girl
whom
we
think
we
should
like
to
marry
and
just
as
zero
pops
up
instead
of
the
number
so
does
our
affinity
come
along
and
upset
all
our
notions
of
the
type
of
girl
we
should
like
to
marry
began
ruth
again
analogy
is
in
the
rough
at
present
i
have
had
time
to
condense
and
polish
it
but
you
see
the
idea
take
my
case
for
instance
when
i
saw
you
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
knew
in
an
instant
that
you
were
my
affinity
but
for
years
i
had
been
looking
for
a
woman
almost
your
exact
opposite
you
are
dark
three
days
ago
i
could
have
imagined
myself
marrying
anyone
who
was
not
fair
your
eyes
are
grey
three
days
ago
my
preference
for
blue
eyes
was
a
you
have
a
shocking
temper
three
days
ago
vince
said
that
philosopher
complacently
stamped
the
gentle
blonde
whom
i
was
looking
for
three
days
ago
would
have
drooped
timidly
three
days
ago
my
passion
for
timid
droopers
amounted
to
an
obsession
ruth
did
not
reply
it
was
useless
to
bandy
words
with
one
who
gave
such
clear
evidence
of
being
something
out
of
the
common
run
of
no
verbal
attack
could
crush
this
extraordinary
young
man
she
walked
on
all
silence
and
stony
profile
uncomfortably
conscious
that
her
companion
was
in
no
way
abashed
by
the
former
and
was
regarding
the
latter
with
that
frank
admiration
which
had
made
itself
so
obnoxious
to
her
before
until
they
reached
their
destination
mr
vince
meanwhile
chatted
cheerfully
and
pointed
out
objects
of
interest
by
the
wayside
at
the
door
ruth
permitted
herself
a
word
of
farewell
she
said
tomorrow
evening
said
mr
vince
shall
be
coming
to
dinner
mr
warden
ambled
home
very
happy
and
contented
two
hours
later
with
half
a
franc
in
his
pocket
this
comparative
wealth
being
due
to
the
fact
that
the
minimum
stake
permitted
by
the
roville
casino
is
just
double
that
sum
he
was
sorry
not
to
have
won
but
his
mind
was
too
full
of
rosy
dreams
to
permit
of
remorse
it
was
the
estimable
old
gentleman
dearest
wish
that
his
daughter
should
marry
some
rich
man
who
would
keep
him
in
affluence
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
and
to
that
end
he
was
in
the
habit
of
introducing
to
her
notice
any
such
that
came
his
way
there
was
no
question
of
coercing
ruth
he
was
too
for
that
besides
he
could
ruth
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
who
is
readily
coerced
he
contented
himself
with
giving
her
the
opportunity
to
inspect
his
exhibits
roville
is
a
sociable
place
and
it
was
not
unusual
for
him
to
make
friends
at
the
casino
and
to
bring
them
home
when
made
for
a
cigar
up
to
the
present
he
was
bound
to
admit
his
efforts
had
not
been
particularly
successful
ruth
he
reflected
sadly
was
a
curious
girl
she
did
not
show
her
best
side
to
these
visitors
there
was
no
encouragement
in
her
manner
she
was
apt
to
frighten
the
unfortunate
exhibits
but
of
this
young
man
vince
he
had
brighter
hopes
he
was
rich
that
was
proved
by
the
very
handsome
way
in
which
he
had
behaved
in
the
matter
of
a
small
loan
when
looking
in
at
the
casino
after
parting
from
ruth
he
had
found
mr
warden
in
sore
straits
for
want
of
a
little
capital
to
back
a
system
which
he
had
conceived
through
closely
observing
the
run
of
the
play
he
was
also
obviously
attracted
by
ruth
and
as
he
was
remarkably
presentable
indeed
quite
an
unusually
young
man
there
seemed
no
reason
why
ruth
should
not
be
equally
attracted
by
him
the
world
looked
good
to
mr
warden
as
he
fell
asleep
that
night
ruth
did
not
fall
asleep
so
easily
the
episode
had
disturbed
her
a
new
element
had
entered
her
life
and
one
that
gave
promise
of
producing
strange
when
on
the
following
evening
ruth
returned
from
the
stroll
on
the
promenade
which
she
always
took
after
leaving
the
with
a
feeling
of
irritation
towards
things
in
general
this
feeling
was
not
diminished
by
the
sight
of
mr
vince
very
much
at
his
ease
standing
against
the
mantelpiece
of
the
tiny
parlour
do
you
do
he
said
an
extraordinary
coincidence
i
happened
to
be
hanging
about
outside
this
house
just
now
when
your
father
came
along
and
invited
me
in
to
dinner
have
you
ever
thought
much
about
coincidences
miss
warden
to
my
mind
they
may
be
described
as
the
zero
on
the
of
life
he
regarded
her
fondly
a
shy
man
conscious
that
the
girl
he
loves
is
inspecting
him
closely
and
making
up
her
mind
about
him
he
proceeded
unexpected
meetings
are
very
trying
ordeals
you
must
not
form
your
judgement
of
me
too
hastily
you
see
me
now
nervous
embarrassed
but
i
am
not
always
like
this
beneath
this
crust
of
diffidence
there
is
sterling
stuff
miss
warden
people
who
know
me
have
spoken
of
me
as
a
little
ray
of
sun
but
here
is
your
father
mr
warden
was
more
than
usually
disappointed
with
ruth
during
dinner
it
was
the
same
old
story
so
far
from
making
herself
pleasant
to
this
attractive
stranger
she
seemed
positively
to
dislike
him
she
was
barely
civil
to
him
with
a
sigh
mr
warden
told
himself
that
he
did
not
understand
ruth
and
the
rosy
dreams
he
had
formed
began
to
fade
ruth
ideas
on
the
subject
of
mr
vince
as
the
days
went
by
were
chaotic
though
she
told
herself
that
she
thoroughly
objected
to
him
he
had
nevertheless
begun
to
have
an
undeniable
attraction
for
her
in
what
this
attraction
consisted
she
could
not
say
when
she
tried
to
analyse
it
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
only
element
in
her
life
that
made
for
excitement
since
his
advent
the
days
had
certainly
passed
more
swiftly
for
her
the
dead
level
of
monotony
had
been
broken
there
was
a
certain
fascination
in
exerting
herself
to
suppress
him
which
increased
daily
as
each
attempt
failed
mr
vince
put
this
feeling
into
words
for
her
he
had
a
maddening
habit
of
discussing
the
progress
of
his
courtship
in
the
manner
of
an
impartial
lecturer
am
making
headway
he
observed
fact
that
we
can
not
meet
without
your
endeavouring
to
plant
a
temperamental
left
jab
on
my
spiritual
solar
plexus
encourages
me
to
think
that
you
are
beginning
at
last
to
understand
that
we
are
affinities
to
persons
of
spirit
like
ourselves
the
only
happy
marriage
is
that
which
is
based
on
a
firm
foundation
of
almost
incessant
quarrelling
the
most
beautiful
line
in
english
poetry
to
my
mind
is
we
fell
out
my
wife
and
i
you
would
be
wretched
with
a
husband
who
did
like
you
to
quarrel
with
him
the
position
of
affairs
now
is
that
i
have
become
necessary
to
you
if
i
went
out
of
your
life
now
i
should
leave
an
aching
void
you
would
still
have
that
beautiful
punch
of
yours
and
there
would
be
nobody
to
exercise
it
on
you
would
pine
away
from
now
on
matters
should
i
think
move
rapidly
during
the
course
of
the
next
week
i
shall
endeavour
to
propitiate
you
with
gifts
here
is
the
first
of
them
he
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
her
it
was
a
rough
and
unfinished
but
wonderfully
clever
even
ruth
could
appreciate
that
and
she
was
a
prejudiced
observer
for
the
sketch
was
a
caricature
of
herself
it
represented
her
drawn
up
to
her
full
height
with
enormous
scornful
eyes
and
curling
lips
and
the
artist
had
managed
to
combine
an
excellent
likeness
while
accentuating
everything
that
was
marked
in
what
she
knew
had
come
to
be
her
normal
expression
of
scorn
and
discontent
did
know
you
were
an
artist
mr
vince
she
said
handing
it
back
poor
amateur
nothing
more
you
may
keep
it
have
not
the
slightest
wish
to
keep
it
have
is
not
in
the
least
clever
and
it
is
very
impertinent
of
you
to
show
it
to
me
the
drawing
is
not
funny
it
is
simply
rude
little
more
said
mr
vince
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
like
it
are
you
fond
of
chocolates
ruth
did
not
answer
am
sending
you
some
tomorrow
shall
return
them
i
shall
send
some
more
and
some
fruit
gifts
soliloquized
mr
vince
that
is
the
secret
keep
sending
gifts
if
men
would
only
stick
to
gifts
and
quarrelling
there
would
be
fewer
bachelors
on
the
morrow
as
promised
the
chocolates
arrived
many
pounds
of
them
in
a
lordly
box
the
bludgeoning
of
fate
had
not
wholly
scotched
in
ruth
a
human
weakness
for
sweets
and
it
was
with
a
distinct
effort
that
she
wrapped
the
box
up
again
and
returned
it
to
the
sender
she
went
off
to
her
work
at
the
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
which
comes
to
those
who
exhibit
an
iron
will
in
trying
circumstances
and
at
the
there
occurred
a
surprising
incident
surprising
incidents
as
mr
vince
would
have
said
are
the
zero
on
the
of
life
they
pop
up
disturbingly
when
least
expected
confusing
the
mind
and
altering
opinions
and
this
was
a
very
surprising
incident
indeed
ruth
as
has
been
stated
sat
during
her
hours
of
work
behind
a
screen
unseen
and
unseeing
to
her
the
patrons
of
the
establishment
were
mere
disembodied
voices
wheedling
voices
pathetic
voices
voices
that
protested
voices
that
hectored
voices
that
whined
moaned
broke
appealed
to
the
saints
and
in
various
other
ways
endeavoured
to
instil
into
gandinot
more
spacious
and
princely
views
on
the
subject
of
advancing
money
on
property
pledged
she
was
sitting
behind
her
screen
this
morning
scribbling
idly
on
the
for
there
had
been
a
lull
in
the
business
when
the
door
opened
and
the
polite
monsieur
of
gandinot
announced
the
arrival
of
another
unfortunate
and
then
shaking
her
like
an
electric
shock
came
a
voice
that
she
knew
the
pleasant
voice
of
mr
vince
the
dialogues
that
took
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
were
often
protracted
and
always
sordid
but
none
had
seemed
to
ruth
so
interminable
so
hideously
sordid
as
this
one
round
and
round
its
miserable
centre
a
silver
the
dreary
argument
circled
the
young
man
pleaded
gandinot
adamant
in
his
official
role
was
immovable
ruth
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
pressed
her
hands
over
her
burning
ears
and
the
voices
ceased
to
trouble
her
and
with
the
silence
came
thought
and
a
blaze
of
understanding
that
flashed
upon
her
and
made
all
things
clear
she
understood
now
why
she
had
closed
her
ears
poverty
is
an
acid
which
reacts
differently
on
differing
natures
it
had
reduced
mr
eugene
warden
to
a
minimum
ruth
it
had
reared
up
to
an
abnormal
growth
her
pride
had
become
a
weed
that
ran
riot
in
her
soul
darkening
it
and
choking
finer
emotions
perhaps
it
was
her
father
naive
stratagems
for
the
enmeshing
of
a
wealthy
husband
that
had
produced
in
her
at
last
a
morbid
antipathy
to
the
idea
of
playing
to
any
man
king
cophetua
the
state
of
mind
is
intelligible
the
cophetua
legend
never
has
been
told
from
the
point
of
view
and
there
must
have
been
moments
when
if
a
woman
of
spirit
she
resented
that
monarch
somewhat
condescending
attitude
and
felt
that
secure
in
his
wealth
and
magnificence
he
had
taken
her
grateful
acquiescence
very
much
for
granted
this
she
saw
now
was
what
had
prejudiced
her
against
george
vince
she
had
assumed
that
he
was
rich
he
had
conveyed
the
impression
of
being
rich
and
she
had
been
on
the
defensive
against
him
accordingly
now
for
the
first
time
she
seemed
to
know
him
a
barrier
had
been
broken
down
the
royal
robes
had
proved
tinsel
and
no
longer
disguised
the
man
she
loved
a
touch
on
her
arm
aroused
her
gandinot
was
standing
by
her
side
terms
apparently
had
been
agreed
upon
and
the
interview
concluded
for
in
his
hand
was
a
silver
mademoiselle
i
could
not
make
you
hear
the
more
i
call
to
you
the
more
you
did
not
answer
it
is
necessary
to
enter
this
loan
he
recited
the
details
and
ruth
entered
them
in
her
ledger
this
done
gandinot
doffing
his
official
self
sighed
is
a
place
of
much
sorrow
mademoiselle
this
office
how
he
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
that
young
man
recently
departed
a
of
yours
mademoiselle
you
would
say
what
does
this
young
man
so
in
a
but
i
know
better
i
gandinot
you
have
an
expression
you
english
i
heard
it
in
paris
in
a
cafe
and
inquired
its
meaning
when
you
say
of
a
man
that
he
swanks
how
many
young
men
have
i
seen
here
admirably
dressed
rich
you
would
say
no
no
the
permits
no
secrets
to
swank
mademoiselle
what
is
it
to
deceive
the
world
yes
but
not
the
yesterday
also
when
you
had
departed
was
he
here
that
young
man
yet
here
he
is
once
more
today
he
spends
his
money
quickly
alas
that
poor
young
swanker
when
ruth
returned
home
that
evening
she
found
her
father
in
the
smoking
a
cigarette
he
greeted
her
with
effusion
but
with
some
uneasiness
for
the
old
gentleman
had
nerved
himself
to
a
delicate
task
he
had
made
up
his
mind
tonight
to
speak
seriously
to
ruth
on
the
subject
of
her
unsatisfactory
behaviour
to
mr
vince
the
more
he
saw
of
that
young
man
the
more
positive
was
he
that
this
was
the
human
for
which
he
had
been
searching
all
these
weary
years
accordingly
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
kissed
ruth
on
the
forehead
and
began
to
speak
it
had
long
been
mr
warden
opinion
that
if
his
daughter
had
a
fault
it
was
a
tendency
towards
a
quite
unnecessary
and
highly
inconvenient
frankness
she
had
not
that
tact
which
he
would
have
liked
a
daughter
of
his
to
possess
she
would
not
evade
ignore
agree
not
to
see
she
was
at
times
painfully
blunt
this
happened
now
he
was
warming
to
his
subject
when
she
interrupted
him
with
a
question
makes
you
think
mr
vince
is
rich
father
she
asked
mr
warden
was
embarrassed
the
subject
of
mr
vince
opulence
had
not
entered
into
his
discourse
he
had
carefully
avoided
it
the
fact
that
he
was
thinking
of
it
and
that
ruth
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
it
and
that
he
knew
that
ruth
knew
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
the
question
was
not
in
order
and
it
embarrassed
him
why
i
do
i
never
said
he
was
rich
my
dear
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
ample
is
quite
poor
mr
warden
jaw
fell
slightly
but
my
dear
that
absurd
he
cried
only
this
evening
he
broke
off
abruptly
but
it
was
too
late
you
been
borrowing
money
from
him
mr
warden
drew
in
his
breath
preparatory
to
an
indignant
denial
but
he
altered
his
mind
and
remained
silent
as
a
borrower
of
money
he
had
every
quality
but
one
he
had
come
to
look
on
her
perspicacity
in
this
matter
as
a
sort
of
second
sight
it
had
frequently
gone
far
to
spoiling
for
him
the
triumph
of
success
he
has
to
pawn
things
to
live
her
voice
trembled
was
at
the
today
and
yesterday
too
i
heard
him
he
was
arguing
with
gandinot
haggling
her
voice
broke
she
was
sobbing
helplessly
the
memory
of
it
was
too
raw
and
vivid
mr
warden
stood
motionless
many
emotions
raced
through
his
mind
but
chief
among
them
the
thought
that
this
revelation
had
come
at
a
very
fortunate
time
an
exceedingly
lucky
escape
he
felt
he
was
aware
also
of
a
certain
measure
of
indignation
against
this
deceitful
young
man
who
had
fraudulently
imitated
a
with
what
might
have
been
disastrous
results
the
door
opened
and
jeanne
the
announced
mr
vince
he
entered
the
room
briskly
evening
he
said
have
brought
you
some
more
chocolates
miss
warden
and
some
fruit
great
scott
what
the
matter
he
stopped
but
only
for
an
instant
the
next
he
had
darted
across
the
room
and
before
the
horrified
eyes
of
mr
warden
was
holding
ruth
in
his
arms
she
clung
to
him
bill
the
over
whom
mr
vince
had
happened
to
stumble
was
the
first
to
speak
almost
simultaneously
mr
warden
joined
in
and
there
was
a
striking
similarity
between
the
two
voices
for
mr
warden
searching
for
words
emitted
as
a
preliminary
to
them
a
sort
of
passionate
yelp
mr
vince
removed
the
hand
that
was
patting
ruth
shoulder
and
waved
it
reassuringly
at
him
all
right
he
said
right
all
explained
mr
vince
over
his
shoulder
hearts
that
beat
as
one
we
going
to
be
married
what
the
matter
dear
you
worry
you
all
right
refuse
shouted
mr
warden
absolutely
refuse
mr
vince
lowered
ruth
gently
into
a
chair
and
holding
her
hand
inspected
the
fermenting
old
gentleman
gravely
refuse
he
said
i
thought
you
liked
me
mr
warden
frenzy
had
cooled
it
had
been
something
foreign
to
his
nature
he
regretted
it
these
things
had
to
be
managed
with
restraint
personal
likes
and
dislikes
he
said
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
mr
vince
they
are
beside
the
point
i
have
my
daughter
to
consider
i
can
not
allow
her
to
marry
a
man
without
a
penny
right
said
mr
vince
approvingly
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fellow
if
he
tries
to
butt
in
send
for
the
police
mr
warden
hesitated
he
had
always
been
a
little
ashamed
of
occupation
but
necessity
compelled
vince
my
daughter
is
employed
at
the
and
was
a
witness
to
all
that
took
place
this
afternoon
mr
vince
was
genuinely
agitated
he
looked
at
ruth
his
face
full
of
concern
do
mean
to
say
you
have
been
slaving
away
in
that
stuffy
great
scott
i
have
you
out
of
that
quick
you
must
go
there
again
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
you
had
better
let
me
explain
he
said
i
always
think
are
the
zero
on
the
of
life
always
somewhere
about
waiting
to
pop
up
have
you
ever
heard
of
vince
stores
mr
warden
perhaps
they
are
since
your
time
well
my
father
is
the
proprietor
one
of
our
specialities
is
children
toys
but
we
have
picked
a
real
winner
for
years
and
my
father
when
i
last
saw
him
seemed
so
distressed
about
it
that
i
said
i
see
if
i
could
whack
out
an
idea
for
something
something
on
the
lines
of
the
billiken
only
better
was
what
he
felt
he
needed
i
not
used
to
brain
work
and
after
a
spell
of
it
i
felt
i
wanted
a
rest
i
came
here
to
recuperate
and
the
very
first
morning
i
got
an
inspiration
you
may
have
noticed
that
the
manager
of
the
here
strong
on
conventional
good
looks
i
saw
him
at
the
casino
and
the
thing
flashed
on
me
he
thinks
his
name
gandinot
but
it
is
uncle
zip
the
the
man
who
makes
you
smile
he
pressed
ruth
hand
affectionately
lost
track
of
him
and
it
was
only
the
day
before
yesterday
that
i
discovered
who
he
was
and
where
he
was
to
be
found
well
you
ca
go
up
to
a
man
and
ask
him
to
pose
as
a
model
for
uncle
zip
the
the
only
way
to
get
sittings
was
to
approach
him
in
the
way
of
business
so
i
collected
what
property
i
had
and
waded
in
that
the
whole
story
do
i
pass
mr
warden
frosty
demeanour
had
gradually
thawed
during
this
recital
and
now
the
sun
of
his
smile
shone
out
warmly
he
gripped
mr
hand
with
every
evidence
of
esteem
and
after
that
he
did
what
was
certainly
the
best
thing
by
passing
gently
from
the
room
on
his
face
as
he
went
was
a
look
such
as
moses
might
have
worn
on
the
summit
of
pisgah
it
was
some
twenty
minutes
later
that
ruth
made
a
remark
want
you
to
promise
me
something
she
said
that
you
wo
go
on
with
that
uncle
zip
drawing
i
know
it
means
ever
so
much
money
but
it
might
hurt
poor
gandinot
feelings
and
he
has
been
very
kind
to
me
settles
it
said
mr
vince
hard
on
the
children
of
great
britain
but
say
no
more
no
uncle
zip
for
them
ruth
looked
at
him
almost
with
awe
really
wo
go
on
with
it
in
spite
of
all
the
money
you
would
make
are
you
always
going
to
do
just
what
i
ask
you
no
matter
what
it
costs
you
he
nodded
sadly
have
sketched
out
in
a
few
words
the
whole
policy
of
my
married
life
i
feel
an
awful
fraud
and
i
had
encouraged
you
to
look
forward
to
years
of
incessant
quarrelling
do
you
think
you
can
manage
without
it
i
afraid
it
going
to
be
shockingly
dull
for
you
said
mr
vince
regretfully
archibald
benefit
archibald
mealing
was
one
of
those
golfers
in
whom
desire
outruns
performance
nobody
could
have
been
more
willing
than
archibald
he
tried
and
tried
hard
every
morning
before
he
took
his
bath
he
would
stand
in
front
of
his
mirror
and
practise
swings
every
night
before
he
went
to
bed
he
would
read
the
golden
words
of
some
master
on
the
subject
of
putting
driving
or
approaching
yet
on
the
links
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
retrieving
lost
balls
or
replacing
america
whether
it
was
that
archibald
pressed
too
much
or
pressed
too
little
whether
it
was
that
his
club
deviated
from
the
dotted
line
which
joined
the
two
points
a
and
b
in
the
illustrated
plate
of
the
man
making
the
brassy
shot
in
the
on
book
or
whether
it
was
that
he
was
pursued
by
some
malignant
fate
i
do
not
know
archibald
rather
favoured
the
last
theory
the
important
point
is
that
in
his
year
after
six
seasons
of
untiring
effort
archibald
went
in
for
a
championship
and
won
it
archibald
mark
you
whose
golf
was
a
kind
of
blend
of
hockey
swedish
drill
and
dancing
i
know
the
ordeal
i
must
face
when
i
make
such
a
statement
i
see
clearly
before
me
the
solid
phalanx
of
men
from
missouri
some
urging
me
to
tell
it
to
the
king
of
denmark
others
insisting
that
i
produce
my
eskimos
nevertheless
i
do
not
shrink
i
state
once
more
that
in
his
year
archibald
mealing
went
in
for
a
golf
championship
and
won
it
archibald
belonged
to
a
select
little
golf
club
the
members
of
which
lived
and
worked
in
new
york
but
played
in
jersey
men
of
substance
financially
as
well
as
physically
they
had
combined
their
superfluous
cash
and
with
it
purchased
a
strip
of
land
close
to
the
sea
this
land
had
been
drained
to
the
huge
discomfort
of
a
colony
of
mosquitoes
which
had
come
to
look
on
the
place
as
their
private
property
and
converted
into
links
which
had
become
a
sort
of
refuge
for
incompetent
golfers
the
members
of
the
cape
pleasant
club
were
easygoing
refugees
from
other
and
more
exacting
clubs
men
who
pottered
rather
than
raced
round
the
links
men
in
short
who
had
grown
tired
of
having
to
stop
their
game
and
stand
aside
in
order
to
allow
perspiring
experts
to
whiz
past
them
the
cape
pleasant
golfers
did
not
make
themselves
slaves
to
the
game
their
language
when
they
foozled
was
gently
regretful
rather
than
sulphurous
the
moment
in
the
day
play
which
they
enjoyed
most
was
when
they
were
saying
here
luck
in
the
it
will
therefore
be
readily
understood
that
archibald
inability
to
do
a
hole
in
single
figures
did
not
handicap
him
at
cape
pleasant
as
it
might
have
done
at
andrews
his
kindly
clubmates
took
him
to
their
bosoms
to
a
man
and
looked
on
him
as
a
brother
archibald
was
one
of
those
admirable
natures
which
prompt
their
possessor
frequently
to
remark
are
on
me
and
his
fellow
golfers
were
not
slow
to
appreciate
the
fact
they
all
loved
archibald
archibald
was
on
the
floor
of
his
bedroom
one
afternoon
picking
up
the
fragments
of
his
mirror
a
friend
had
advised
him
to
practise
the
walter
travis
lofting
shot
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
he
took
up
the
receiver
and
was
hailed
by
the
comfortable
voice
of
mccay
the
club
secretary
that
mealing
asked
mccay
archie
i
putting
your
name
down
for
our
championship
competition
that
right
is
it
said
archibald
does
it
start
saturday
me
for
you
oh
archie
man
i
met
today
told
me
you
were
engaged
is
that
a
fact
murmured
archibald
blushfully
the
wire
hummed
with
mccay
congratulations
said
archibald
old
man
what
oh
yes
milsom
her
name
by
the
way
her
family
have
taken
a
cottage
at
cape
pleasant
for
the
summer
some
distance
from
the
links
yes
very
convenient
it
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
resumed
his
task
of
gathering
up
the
fragments
now
mccay
happened
to
be
of
a
romantic
and
sentimental
nature
he
was
by
profession
a
chartered
accountant
and
inclined
to
be
stout
and
all
rather
stout
chartered
accountants
are
sentimental
mccay
was
the
sort
of
man
who
keeps
old
ball
programmes
and
bundles
of
letters
tied
round
with
lilac
ribbon
at
country
houses
where
they
lingered
in
the
porch
after
dinner
to
watch
the
moonlight
flooding
the
quiet
garden
it
was
mccay
and
his
colleague
who
lingered
longest
mccay
knew
ella
wheeler
wilcox
by
heart
and
could
take
browning
without
anaesthetics
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
archibald
remark
about
his
fiancee
coming
to
live
at
cape
pleasant
should
give
him
food
for
thought
it
appealed
to
him
he
reflected
on
it
a
good
deal
during
the
day
and
running
across
sigsbee
a
fellow
cape
pleasanter
after
dinner
that
night
at
the
sybarites
club
he
spoke
of
the
matter
to
him
it
so
happened
that
both
had
dined
excellently
and
were
looking
on
the
world
with
a
sort
of
cosy
benevolence
they
were
in
the
mood
when
men
pat
small
boys
on
the
head
and
ask
them
if
they
mean
to
be
president
when
they
grow
up
called
up
archie
mealing
today
said
mccay
you
know
he
was
engaged
did
hear
something
about
it
girl
of
the
name
of
wilson
or
she
going
to
spend
the
summer
at
cape
pleasant
archie
tells
me
she
have
a
chance
of
seeing
him
play
in
the
championship
competition
mccay
sucked
his
cigar
in
silence
for
a
while
watching
with
dreamy
eyes
the
blue
smoke
as
it
curled
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
singularly
soft
you
know
sigsbee
he
said
sipping
his
maraschino
with
a
gentle
melancholy
you
know
there
is
something
wonderfully
pathetic
to
me
in
this
business
i
see
the
whole
thing
so
clearly
there
was
a
kind
of
quiver
in
the
poor
old
chap
voice
when
he
said
she
is
coming
to
cape
pleasant
which
told
me
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
it
is
a
tragedy
in
its
way
sigsbee
we
may
smile
at
it
think
it
trivial
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
tragedy
that
enthusiastic
girl
all
eagerness
to
see
the
man
she
loves
do
well
archie
poor
old
archie
all
on
fire
to
prove
to
her
that
her
trust
in
him
is
not
misplaced
and
the
end
disillusionment
disappointment
unhappiness
ought
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
ball
said
the
more
practical
sigsbee
possibly
continued
mccay
has
told
her
that
he
will
win
this
championship
archie
mutt
enough
to
have
told
her
that
said
sigsbee
decidedly
deserves
all
he
gets
waiter
two
scotch
highballs
mccay
was
in
no
mood
to
subscribe
to
this
view
tell
you
he
said
for
archie
i
for
the
poor
old
chap
and
i
more
than
sorry
for
the
girl
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
said
sigsbee
can
hardly
be
expected
to
foozle
on
purpose
just
to
let
archie
show
off
before
his
girl
mccay
paused
in
the
act
of
lighting
his
cigar
as
one
smitten
with
a
great
thought
not
he
said
not
sigsbee
sigsbee
you
hit
it
have
i
tell
you
sigsbee
you
solved
the
whole
thing
such
a
bully
good
fellow
why
not
give
him
a
benefit
why
not
let
him
win
this
championship
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
you
care
whether
you
win
a
tin
medal
or
not
sigsbee
benevolence
was
expanding
under
the
influence
of
the
scotch
highball
and
his
cigar
little
acts
of
kindness
on
archie
part
here
a
cigar
there
a
lunch
at
another
time
seats
for
the
theatre
began
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
his
memory
like
bubbles
he
wavered
but
what
about
the
rest
of
the
men
he
said
will
be
a
dozen
or
more
in
for
the
medal
can
square
them
said
mccay
confidently
will
broach
the
matter
to
them
at
a
series
of
dinners
at
which
we
will
be
joint
hosts
they
are
white
men
who
will
be
charmed
to
do
a
little
thing
like
that
for
a
sport
like
archie
about
gossett
said
sigsbee
mccay
face
clouded
gossett
was
an
unpopular
subject
with
members
of
the
cape
pleasant
golf
club
he
was
the
serpent
in
their
eden
nobody
seemed
quite
to
know
how
he
had
got
in
but
there
unfortunately
he
was
gossett
had
introduced
into
cape
pleasant
golf
a
cheerless
atmosphere
of
the
rigour
of
the
game
it
was
to
enable
them
to
avoid
just
such
golfers
as
gossett
that
the
cape
pleasanters
had
founded
their
club
genial
courtesy
rather
than
strict
attention
to
the
rules
had
been
the
leading
characteristics
of
their
play
till
his
arrival
up
to
that
time
it
had
been
looked
on
as
rather
bad
form
to
exact
a
penalty
a
cheery
system
had
prevailed
then
gossett
had
come
full
of
strange
rules
and
created
about
the
same
stir
in
the
community
which
a
hawk
would
create
in
a
gathering
of
doves
ca
square
gossett
said
sigsbee
mccay
looked
unhappy
forgot
him
he
said
course
nothing
will
stop
him
trying
to
win
i
wish
we
could
think
of
something
i
would
almost
as
soon
see
him
lose
as
archie
win
but
after
all
he
does
have
off
days
sometimes
need
to
have
a
very
off
day
to
be
as
bad
as
archie
they
sat
and
smoked
in
silence
got
it
said
sigsbee
suddenly
is
a
fine
golfer
but
nervous
if
we
upset
his
nerves
enough
he
will
go
right
off
his
stroke
could
we
think
of
some
way
mccay
reached
out
for
his
glass
is
a
noble
nature
sigsbee
he
said
no
said
the
paragon
modestly
another
cigar
in
order
that
the
reader
may
get
the
mental
on
the
plot
of
this
narrative
which
is
so
essential
if
a
short
story
is
to
charm
elevate
and
instruct
it
is
necessary
now
for
the
nonce
but
only
for
the
nonce
to
inspect
archibald
past
life
archibald
as
he
had
stated
to
mccay
was
engaged
to
a
miss
milsom
miss
margaret
milsom
how
few
men
dear
reader
are
engaged
to
girls
with
figures
brown
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
now
sparkling
and
vivacious
now
dreamy
and
soulful
but
always
large
and
blue
how
few
i
say
you
are
dear
reader
and
so
am
i
but
who
else
archibald
was
one
of
the
few
who
happened
to
be
he
was
happy
it
is
true
that
margaret
mother
was
not
as
it
were
wrapped
up
in
him
she
exhibited
none
of
that
effervescent
joy
at
his
appearance
which
we
like
to
see
in
our
elect
on
the
contrary
she
generally
cried
bitterly
whenever
she
saw
him
and
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
was
apt
to
retire
sobbing
to
her
room
where
she
remained
in
a
state
of
till
an
advanced
hour
she
was
by
way
of
being
a
confirmed
invalid
and
something
about
archibald
seemed
to
get
right
in
among
her
nerve
centres
reducing
them
for
the
time
being
to
a
complicated
hash
she
did
not
like
archibald
she
said
she
liked
big
manly
men
behind
his
back
she
not
infrequently
referred
to
him
as
a
sometimes
even
as
that
she
did
not
do
this
to
margaret
for
margaret
besides
being
was
also
a
shade
whenever
she
discussed
archibald
it
was
with
her
son
stuyvesant
stuyvesant
milsom
who
thought
archibald
a
bit
of
an
ass
was
always
ready
to
sit
and
listen
to
his
mother
on
the
subject
it
being
however
an
understood
thing
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
seance
she
yielded
one
or
two
bills
towards
his
racing
debts
for
stuyvesant
having
developed
a
habit
of
backing
horses
which
either
did
not
start
at
all
or
else
sat
down
and
thought
in
the
middle
of
the
race
could
always
do
with
ten
dollars
or
so
his
prices
for
these
interviews
worked
out
as
a
rule
at
about
three
cents
a
word
in
these
circumstances
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
archibald
and
margaret
should
prefer
to
meet
when
they
did
meet
at
some
other
spot
than
the
milsom
home
it
suited
them
both
better
that
they
should
arrange
a
secret
tryst
on
these
occasions
archibald
preferred
it
because
being
in
the
same
room
as
mrs
milsom
always
made
him
feel
like
a
murderer
with
particularly
large
feet
and
margaret
preferred
it
because
as
she
told
archibald
these
secret
meetings
lent
a
touch
of
poetry
to
what
might
otherwise
have
been
a
commonplace
engagement
archibald
thought
this
charming
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
margaret
passion
for
the
poetic
cut
so
to
speak
both
ways
he
admired
and
loved
the
loftiness
of
her
soul
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
tough
job
having
to
live
up
to
it
for
archibald
was
a
very
ordinary
young
man
they
had
tried
to
inoculate
him
with
a
love
of
poetry
at
school
but
it
had
not
taken
until
he
was
thirty
he
had
been
satisfied
to
class
all
poetry
except
that
of
mr
george
cohan
under
the
general
heading
of
punk
then
he
met
margaret
and
the
trouble
began
on
the
day
he
first
met
her
at
a
picnic
she
had
looked
so
soulful
so
aloof
from
this
world
that
he
had
felt
instinctively
that
here
was
a
girl
who
expected
more
from
a
man
than
a
mere
statement
that
the
weather
was
great
it
so
chanced
that
he
knew
just
one
quotation
from
the
classics
to
wit
critique
of
the
of
avilion
he
knew
this
because
he
had
had
the
passage
to
write
out
one
hundred
and
fifty
times
at
school
on
the
occasion
of
his
being
caught
smoking
by
one
of
the
faculty
who
happened
to
be
a
passionate
admirer
of
the
of
the
king
a
remark
of
margaret
that
it
was
a
splendid
day
for
a
picnic
and
that
the
country
looked
nice
gave
him
his
opportunity
reminds
me
he
said
reminds
me
strongly
of
the
of
avilion
where
falls
not
hail
or
rain
or
any
snow
nor
ever
wind
blows
loudly
but
it
lies
happy
fair
with
orchard
lawns
he
broke
off
here
to
squash
a
hornet
but
margaret
had
heard
enough
you
fond
of
the
poets
mr
mealing
she
said
with
a
look
said
archibald
fervently
why
i
eat
alive
and
that
was
how
all
the
trouble
had
started
it
had
meant
unremitting
toil
for
archibald
he
felt
that
he
had
set
himself
a
standard
from
which
he
must
not
fall
he
bought
every
new
volume
of
poetry
which
was
praised
in
the
press
and
learned
the
reviews
by
heart
every
evening
he
read
painfully
a
portion
of
the
classics
he
plodded
through
the
poetry
sections
of
bartlett
devotion
to
the
various
bards
was
so
enthusiastic
and
her
reading
so
wide
that
there
were
times
when
archibald
wondered
if
he
could
endure
the
strain
but
he
persevered
heroically
and
so
far
had
not
been
found
wanting
but
the
strain
was
fearful
the
early
stages
of
the
cape
pleasant
golf
tournament
need
no
detailed
description
the
rules
of
match
play
governed
the
contests
and
archibald
disposed
of
his
first
three
opponents
before
the
twelfth
hole
he
had
been
diffident
when
he
teed
off
with
mccay
in
the
first
round
but
finding
that
he
defeated
the
secretary
with
ease
he
met
one
butler
in
the
second
round
with
more
confidence
butler
too
he
routed
with
the
result
that
by
the
time
he
faced
sigsbee
in
round
three
he
was
practically
the
conquering
hero
fortune
seemed
to
be
beaming
upon
him
with
almost
insipid
sweetness
when
he
was
trapped
in
the
bunker
at
the
seventh
hole
sigsbee
became
trapped
as
well
when
he
sliced
at
the
sixth
tee
sigsbee
pulled
and
archibald
striking
a
brilliant
vein
did
the
next
three
holes
in
eleven
nine
and
twelve
and
romping
home
qualified
for
the
final
gossett
that
serpent
meanwhile
had
beaten
each
of
his
three
opponents
without
much
difficulty
the
final
was
fixed
for
the
following
thursday
morning
gossett
who
was
a
broker
had
made
some
frivolous
objection
about
the
difficulty
of
absenting
himself
from
wall
street
but
had
been
overruled
when
sigsbee
pointed
out
that
he
could
easily
defeat
archibald
and
get
to
the
city
by
if
he
wished
and
that
in
any
case
his
partner
would
be
looking
after
things
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
though
reluctantly
it
was
a
fact
that
gossett
was
in
the
midst
of
some
rather
sizeable
deals
at
that
time
thursday
morning
suited
archibald
admirably
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
bring
off
a
double
event
margaret
had
arrived
at
cape
pleasant
on
the
previous
evening
and
he
had
arranged
by
telephone
to
meet
her
at
the
end
of
the
which
was
about
a
mile
from
the
links
at
one
supply
her
with
lunch
and
spend
the
afternoon
with
her
on
the
water
if
he
started
his
match
with
gossett
at
he
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
have
his
game
and
be
at
the
end
of
the
at
the
appointed
hour
he
had
no
delusions
about
the
respective
merits
of
gossett
and
himself
as
golfers
he
knew
that
gossett
would
win
the
necessary
ten
holes
off
the
reel
it
was
saddening
but
it
was
a
scientific
fact
there
was
no
avoiding
it
one
simply
had
to
face
it
having
laid
these
plans
he
caught
the
train
on
the
thursday
morning
with
the
consoling
feeling
that
however
sadly
the
morning
might
begin
it
was
bound
to
end
well
the
day
was
fine
the
sun
warm
but
tempered
with
a
light
breeze
one
or
two
of
the
club
had
come
to
watch
the
match
among
them
sigsbee
sigsbee
drew
gossett
aside
must
let
me
caddie
for
you
old
man
he
said
know
your
temperament
so
exactly
i
know
how
little
it
takes
to
put
you
off
your
stroke
in
an
ordinary
game
you
might
take
one
of
these
boys
i
know
but
on
an
important
occasion
like
this
you
must
not
risk
it
a
grubby
boy
probably
with
a
squint
would
almost
certainly
get
on
your
nerves
he
might
even
make
comments
on
the
game
or
whistle
but
i
understand
you
you
must
let
me
carry
your
clubs
very
good
of
you
said
gossett
at
all
said
sigsbee
archibald
was
now
preparing
to
drive
off
from
the
first
tee
he
did
this
with
great
care
everyone
who
has
seen
archibald
mealing
play
golf
knows
that
his
teeing
off
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
sights
ever
witnessed
on
the
links
he
tilted
his
cap
over
his
eyes
waggled
his
club
a
little
shifted
his
feet
waggled
his
club
some
more
gazed
keenly
towards
the
horizon
for
a
moment
waggled
his
club
again
and
finally
with
the
air
of
a
strong
man
lifting
a
bar
of
iron
raised
it
slowly
above
his
head
then
bringing
it
down
with
a
sweep
he
drove
the
ball
with
a
lofty
slice
some
fifty
yards
it
was
rarely
that
he
failed
either
to
slice
or
pull
his
ball
his
progress
from
hole
to
hole
was
generally
a
majestic
zigzag
gossett
drive
took
him
well
on
the
way
to
the
green
he
holed
out
in
five
archibald
mournful
but
not
surprised
made
his
way
to
the
second
tee
the
second
hole
was
shorter
gossett
won
it
in
three
the
third
he
took
in
six
the
fourth
in
four
archibald
began
to
feel
that
he
might
just
as
well
not
be
there
he
was
practically
a
spectator
at
this
point
he
reached
in
his
pocket
for
his
to
console
himself
with
smoke
to
his
dismay
he
found
it
was
not
there
he
had
had
it
in
the
train
but
now
it
had
vanished
this
added
to
his
gloom
for
the
pouch
had
been
given
to
him
by
margaret
and
he
had
always
thought
it
one
more
proof
of
the
way
her
nature
towered
over
the
natures
of
other
girls
that
she
had
not
woven
a
monogram
on
it
in
this
record
pouch
was
missing
and
archibald
mourned
for
the
loss
his
sorrows
were
not
alleviated
by
the
fact
that
gossett
won
the
fifth
and
sixth
holes
it
was
now
a
quarter
past
twelve
and
archibald
reflected
with
moody
satisfaction
that
the
massacre
must
soon
be
over
and
that
he
would
then
be
able
to
forget
it
in
the
society
of
margaret
as
gossett
was
about
to
drive
off
from
the
seventh
tee
a
telegraph
boy
approached
the
little
group
gossett
he
said
gossett
lowered
his
driver
and
wheeled
round
but
sigsbee
had
snatched
the
envelope
from
the
boy
hand
all
right
old
man
he
said
right
ahead
i
keep
it
safe
for
you
it
to
me
said
gossett
anxiously
may
be
from
the
office
something
may
have
happened
to
the
market
i
may
be
needed
no
said
sigsbee
soothingly
you
worry
about
it
better
not
open
it
it
might
have
something
in
it
that
would
put
you
off
your
stroke
wait
till
the
end
of
the
game
it
to
me
i
want
to
see
it
sigsbee
was
firm
he
said
here
to
see
you
win
this
championship
and
i
have
you
taking
any
risks
besides
even
if
it
was
important
a
few
minutes
wo
make
any
difference
at
any
rate
open
it
and
read
it
is
probably
in
cipher
said
sigsbee
would
understand
it
play
on
old
man
you
only
a
few
more
holes
to
win
gossett
turned
and
addressed
his
ball
again
then
he
swung
the
club
tipped
the
ball
and
it
rolled
sluggishly
for
a
couple
of
feet
archibald
approached
the
tee
now
there
were
moments
when
archibald
could
drive
quite
decently
he
always
applied
a
considerable
amount
of
muscular
force
to
his
efforts
it
was
in
that
direction
as
a
rule
he
erred
on
this
occasion
whether
inspired
by
his
rival
failure
or
merely
favoured
by
chance
he
connected
with
his
ball
at
precisely
the
right
moment
it
flew
from
the
tee
straight
hard
and
low
struck
the
ground
near
the
green
bounded
on
and
finally
rocked
to
within
a
foot
of
the
hole
no
such
long
ball
had
been
driven
on
the
cape
pleasant
links
since
their
foundation
that
it
should
have
taken
him
three
strokes
to
hole
out
from
this
promising
position
was
unfortunate
but
not
fatal
for
gossett
who
seemed
suddenly
to
have
fallen
off
his
game
only
reached
the
green
in
seven
a
moment
later
a
murmur
of
approval
signified
the
fact
that
archibald
had
won
his
first
hole
gossett
said
a
voice
those
murmuring
approval
observed
that
the
telegraph
boy
was
once
more
in
their
midst
this
time
he
bore
two
missives
sigsbee
dexterously
impounded
both
he
said
with
decision
absolutely
refuse
to
let
you
look
at
them
till
the
game
is
over
i
know
your
temperament
gossett
gesticulated
they
must
be
important
they
must
come
from
my
office
where
else
would
i
get
a
stream
of
telegrams
something
has
gone
wrong
i
am
urgently
needed
sigsbee
nodded
gravely
is
what
i
fear
he
said
is
why
i
can
not
risk
having
you
upset
time
enough
gossett
for
bad
news
after
the
game
play
on
man
and
dismiss
it
from
your
mind
besides
you
could
get
back
to
new
york
just
yet
in
any
case
there
are
no
trains
dismiss
the
whole
thing
from
your
mind
and
just
play
your
usual
and
you
sure
to
win
archibald
had
driven
off
during
this
conversation
but
without
his
previous
success
this
time
he
had
pulled
his
ball
into
some
long
grass
gossett
drive
was
however
worse
and
the
subsequent
movement
of
the
pair
to
the
hole
resembled
more
than
anything
else
the
manoeuvres
of
two
men
rolling
peanuts
with
toothpicks
as
the
result
of
an
election
bet
archibald
finally
took
the
hole
in
twelve
after
gossett
had
played
his
fourteenth
when
archibald
won
the
next
in
eleven
and
the
tenth
in
nine
hope
began
to
flicker
feebly
in
his
bosom
but
when
he
won
two
more
holes
bringing
the
score
to
it
flamed
up
within
him
like
a
beacon
the
ordinary
golfer
whose
scores
per
hole
seldom
exceed
those
of
colonel
bogey
does
not
understand
the
whirl
of
mixed
sensations
which
the
really
incompetent
performer
experiences
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
does
strike
a
winning
vein
as
stroke
follows
stroke
and
he
continues
to
hold
his
opponent
a
wild
exhilaration
surges
through
him
followed
by
a
sort
of
awe
as
if
he
were
doing
something
wrong
even
irreligious
then
all
these
yeasty
emotions
subside
and
are
blended
into
one
glorious
sensation
of
grandeur
and
majesty
as
of
a
giant
among
pygmies
by
the
time
that
archibald
putting
with
the
care
of
one
brushing
flies
off
a
sleeping
venus
had
holed
out
and
won
the
thirteenth
he
was
in
the
full
grip
of
this
feeling
and
as
he
walked
to
the
fifteenth
tee
after
winning
the
fourteenth
he
felt
that
this
was
life
that
till
now
he
had
been
a
mere
mollusc
just
at
that
moment
he
happened
to
look
at
his
watch
and
the
sight
was
like
a
douche
of
cold
water
the
hands
stood
at
five
minutes
to
one
let
us
pause
and
ponder
on
this
point
for
a
while
let
us
not
dismiss
it
as
if
it
were
some
mere
trivial
everyday
difficulty
you
dear
reader
play
an
accurate
scientific
game
and
beat
your
opponent
with
ease
every
time
you
go
the
links
and
so
do
i
but
archibald
was
not
like
us
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
ever
felt
that
he
was
playing
well
enough
to
give
him
a
chance
of
defeating
a
really
good
man
true
he
had
beaten
mccay
sigsbee
and
butler
in
the
earlier
rounds
but
they
were
ignoble
rivals
compared
with
gossett
to
defeat
gossett
however
meant
the
championship
on
the
other
hand
he
was
passionately
devoted
to
margaret
milsom
whom
he
was
due
to
meet
at
the
end
of
the
at
one
sharp
it
was
now
five
minutes
to
one
and
the
end
of
the
still
a
mile
away
the
mental
struggle
was
brief
but
keen
a
sharp
pang
and
his
mind
was
made
up
cost
what
it
might
he
must
stay
on
the
links
if
margaret
broke
off
the
engagement
well
it
might
be
that
time
would
heal
the
wound
and
that
after
many
years
he
would
find
some
other
girl
for
whom
he
might
come
to
care
in
a
wrecked
broken
sort
of
way
but
a
chance
like
this
could
never
come
again
what
is
love
compared
with
holing
out
before
your
opponent
the
excitement
now
had
become
so
intense
that
a
small
boy
following
with
the
crowd
swallowed
his
for
a
slight
improvement
had
become
noticeable
in
gossett
play
and
a
slight
improvement
in
the
play
of
almost
anyone
meant
that
it
became
vastly
superior
to
archibald
at
the
next
hole
the
improvement
was
not
marked
enough
to
have
its
full
effect
and
archibald
contrived
to
halve
this
made
him
two
up
and
three
to
play
what
the
average
golfer
would
consider
a
commanding
lead
but
archibald
was
no
average
golfer
a
commanding
lead
for
him
would
have
been
two
up
and
one
to
play
to
give
the
public
of
his
best
your
golfer
should
have
his
mind
cool
and
intent
upon
the
game
inasmuch
as
gossett
was
worrying
about
the
telegrams
while
archibald
strive
as
he
might
to
dismiss
it
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
margaret
standing
alone
and
deserted
on
the
play
became
as
it
were
ragged
fine
putting
enabled
gossett
to
do
the
sixteenth
hole
in
twelve
and
when
winning
the
seventeenth
in
nine
he
brought
his
score
level
with
archibald
the
match
seemed
over
but
just
then
gossett
said
a
familiar
voice
once
more
was
the
telegraph
boy
among
those
present
dis
time
he
observed
gossett
sprang
but
again
the
watchful
sigsbee
was
too
swift
brave
gossett
be
brave
he
said
is
a
crisis
in
the
game
keep
your
nerve
play
just
as
if
nothing
existed
outside
the
links
to
look
at
these
telegrams
now
would
be
fatal
of
that
great
encounter
will
tell
the
story
of
the
last
hole
to
their
dying
day
it
was
one
of
those
titanic
struggles
which
time
can
not
efface
from
the
memory
archibald
was
fortunate
in
getting
a
good
start
he
only
missed
twice
before
he
struck
his
ball
on
the
tee
gossett
had
four
strokes
ere
he
achieved
the
feat
nor
did
archibald
luck
desert
him
in
the
journey
to
the
green
he
was
out
of
the
bunker
in
eleven
gossett
emerged
only
after
sixteen
finally
when
stroke
sent
the
ball
trickling
into
the
hole
gossett
had
played
his
thirtieth
the
ball
had
hardly
rested
on
the
bottom
of
the
hole
before
gossett
had
begun
to
tear
the
telegrams
from
their
envelopes
as
he
read
his
eyes
bulged
in
their
sockets
bad
news
i
hope
said
a
sympathetic
bystander
sigsbee
took
the
sheaf
of
telegrams
the
first
ran
luck
hope
you
win
mccay
the
second
also
ran
luck
hope
you
win
mccay
so
singularly
enough
did
the
third
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
scott
said
sigsbee
seems
to
have
been
pretty
anxious
not
to
run
any
risk
of
missing
you
gossett
as
he
spoke
archibald
close
beside
him
was
looking
at
his
watch
the
hands
stood
at
a
quarter
to
two
margaret
and
her
mother
were
seated
in
the
parlour
when
archibald
arrived
mrs
milsom
who
had
elicited
the
fact
that
archibald
had
not
kept
his
appointment
had
been
saying
told
you
so
for
some
time
and
this
had
not
improved
margaret
temper
when
therefore
archibald
damp
and
dishevelled
was
shown
in
the
chill
in
the
air
nearly
gave
him
mrs
milsom
did
her
celebrated
imitation
of
the
gorgon
while
margaret
lightly
humming
an
air
picked
up
a
weekly
paper
and
became
absorbed
in
it
let
me
explain
panted
archibald
mrs
milsom
was
understood
to
remark
that
she
dared
say
margaret
attention
was
riveted
by
a
fashion
plate
in
a
taximeter
to
the
ferry
this
morning
resumed
archibald
had
an
accident
this
was
the
result
of
some
rather
feverish
on
the
way
from
the
links
to
the
cottage
the
periodical
flopped
to
the
floor
archie
are
you
hurt
few
scratches
nothing
more
but
it
made
me
miss
my
train
train
did
you
catch
asked
mrs
milsom
sepulchrally
one
i
came
straight
on
here
from
the
station
said
margaret
was
coming
home
on
the
one
train
did
you
see
him
archibald
jaw
dropped
slightly
no
he
said
curious
said
margaret
curious
said
archibald
curious
said
mrs
milsom
they
were
still
reflecting
on
the
singularity
of
this
fact
when
the
door
opened
and
the
son
of
the
house
entered
in
person
i
should
find
you
here
mealing
he
said
gave
me
this
at
the
station
to
give
to
you
you
dropped
it
this
morning
when
you
got
out
of
the
train
he
handed
archibald
the
missing
pouch
said
the
latter
huskily
you
say
this
morning
of
course
you
mean
this
afternoon
but
thanks
all
the
same
thanks
thanks
archibald
mealing
he
does
mean
this
afternoon
said
mrs
milsom
speak
from
what
train
did
that
guf
did
mr
mealing
alight
when
he
dropped
the
ten
the
fellow
told
me
said
he
would
have
given
it
back
to
him
then
only
he
sprinted
off
in
the
deuce
of
a
hurry
six
eyes
focused
themselves
upon
archibald
he
said
will
not
try
to
deceive
you
may
try
observed
mrs
milsom
you
will
not
succeed
archibald
archibald
fingered
his
collar
was
no
taximeter
accident
said
mrs
milsom
fact
is
i
have
been
playing
in
a
golf
tournament
margaret
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
golf
archibald
bowed
his
head
with
manly
resignation
did
you
tell
me
why
did
you
arrange
for
us
to
meet
on
the
links
i
should
have
loved
it
archibald
was
amazed
take
an
interest
in
golf
margaret
you
i
thought
you
scorned
it
considered
it
an
unintellectual
game
i
thought
you
considered
all
games
unintellectual
i
play
golf
myself
not
very
well
why
did
you
tell
me
thought
you
might
not
like
it
you
were
so
spiritual
so
poetic
i
feared
you
would
despise
me
archibald
took
a
step
forward
his
voice
was
tense
and
trembling
he
said
is
no
time
for
misunderstandings
we
must
be
open
with
one
another
our
happiness
is
at
stake
tell
me
honestly
do
you
like
poetry
really
margaret
hesitated
then
answered
bravely
archibald
she
said
is
as
you
suspect
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
do
like
poetry
ah
you
shudder
you
turn
away
your
face
grows
hard
and
scornful
do
yelled
archibald
does
it
does
do
anything
of
the
sort
you
made
me
another
man
she
stared
astonished
do
you
mean
that
you
too
should
just
say
i
do
i
tell
you
i
hate
the
beastly
stuff
i
only
pretended
to
like
it
because
i
thought
you
did
the
hours
i
spent
learning
it
up
i
wonder
i
not
got
brain
fever
used
you
to
read
it
up
too
oh
if
i
only
known
you
forgive
me
this
morning
i
mean
course
you
could
leave
a
golf
tournament
by
the
way
how
did
you
get
on
archibald
coughed
well
he
said
modestly
decently
in
fact
not
badly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
won
the
championship
championship
whispered
margaret
america
not
of
america
said
archibald
all
the
same
a
championship
hero
wo
be
wanting
me
for
a
while
i
guess
said
stuyvesant
nonchalantly
i
smoke
a
cigarette
on
the
porch
and
sobs
from
the
stairs
told
that
mrs
milsom
was
already
on
her
way
to
her
room
the
man
the
maid
and
the
miasma
although
this
story
is
concerned
principally
with
the
man
and
the
maid
the
miasma
pervades
it
to
such
an
extent
that
i
feel
justified
in
putting
his
name
on
the
bills
webster
dictionary
gives
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
infection
floating
in
the
air
a
deadly
exhalation
and
in
the
opinion
of
mr
robert
ferguson
his
late
employer
that
description
though
perhaps
a
little
too
flattering
on
the
whole
summed
up
master
roland
bean
pretty
satisfactorily
until
the
previous
day
he
had
served
mr
ferguson
in
the
capacity
of
but
there
was
that
about
master
bean
which
made
it
practically
impossible
for
anyone
to
employ
him
for
long
a
syndicate
of
galahad
parsifal
and
marcus
aurelius
might
have
done
it
but
to
an
ordinary
erring
man
conscious
of
things
done
which
should
not
have
been
done
and
other
things
equally
numerous
left
undone
he
was
too
oppressive
one
conscience
is
enough
for
any
man
the
employer
of
master
bean
had
to
cringe
before
two
nobody
can
last
long
against
an
whose
eyes
shine
with
quiet
respectful
reproof
through
spectacles
whose
manner
is
that
of
a
saint
and
who
obviously
knows
all
the
plod
and
punctuality
books
by
heart
and
orders
his
life
by
their
precepts
master
bean
was
a
walking
edition
of
to
success
millionaires
who
have
never
and
man
get
up
galahad
parsifal
and
marcus
aurelius
as
i
say
might
have
remained
tranquil
in
his
presence
but
robert
ferguson
found
the
contract
too
large
after
one
month
he
had
braced
himself
up
and
sacked
the
punctual
plodder
yet
now
he
was
sitting
in
his
office
long
after
the
last
clerk
had
left
long
after
the
hour
at
which
he
himself
was
wont
to
leave
his
mind
full
of
his
late
employee
was
this
remorse
was
he
longing
for
the
touch
of
the
vanished
hand
the
gleam
of
the
departed
spectacles
he
was
not
his
mind
was
full
of
master
bean
because
master
bean
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
outer
office
and
he
lingered
on
at
his
desk
after
the
day
work
was
done
for
the
same
reason
word
had
been
brought
to
him
earlier
in
the
evening
that
master
roland
bean
would
like
to
see
him
the
answer
to
that
was
easy
him
i
busy
master
bean
admirably
dignified
reply
was
that
he
understood
how
great
was
the
pressure
of
mr
ferguson
work
and
that
he
would
wait
till
he
was
at
liberty
liberty
talk
of
the
liberty
of
the
treed
possum
but
do
not
use
the
word
in
connexion
with
a
man
bottled
up
in
an
office
with
roland
bean
guarding
the
only
exit
mr
ferguson
kicked
the
basket
savagely
the
unfairness
of
the
thing
hurt
him
a
sacked
ought
to
stay
sacked
he
had
no
business
to
come
popping
up
again
like
banquo
ghost
it
was
not
playing
the
game
the
reader
may
wonder
what
was
the
trouble
why
mr
ferguson
could
not
stalk
out
and
brusquely
dispose
of
his
foe
but
then
the
reader
has
not
employed
master
bean
for
a
month
mr
ferguson
had
and
his
nerve
had
broken
a
slight
cough
penetrated
the
door
between
the
two
offices
mr
ferguson
rose
and
grabbed
his
hat
perhaps
a
sudden
rush
he
shot
out
with
the
tense
concentration
of
one
moving
towards
the
at
a
station
where
the
train
stops
three
minutes
evening
sir
was
the
watcher
bean
said
mr
ferguson
flitting
rapidly
still
here
i
thought
you
had
gone
i
afraid
i
can
not
stop
now
some
other
time
he
was
almost
through
fear
sir
that
you
will
be
unable
to
get
out
said
master
bean
sympathetically
building
is
locked
up
men
who
have
been
hit
by
bullets
say
the
first
sensation
is
merely
a
sort
of
dull
shock
so
it
was
with
mr
ferguson
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
and
stared
porter
closes
the
door
at
seven
punctually
sir
it
is
now
nearly
twenty
minutes
after
the
hour
mr
ferguson
brain
was
still
in
the
numbed
stage
the
door
he
said
sir
how
are
we
to
get
out
fear
we
can
not
get
out
sir
mr
ferguson
digested
this
am
no
longer
in
your
employment
sir
said
master
bean
respectfully
i
hope
that
in
the
circumstances
you
will
permit
me
to
remain
here
during
the
night
the
night
would
enable
me
to
sleep
more
comfortably
than
on
the
stairs
we
ca
stop
here
all
night
said
mr
ferguson
feebly
he
had
anticipated
an
unpleasant
five
minutes
in
master
bean
company
imagination
boggled
at
the
thought
of
an
unpleasant
thirteen
hours
he
collapsed
into
a
chair
called
said
master
bean
shelving
the
trivial
subject
of
the
prospective
vigil
the
hope
that
i
might
persuade
you
sir
to
reconsider
your
decision
in
regard
to
my
dismissal
i
can
assure
you
sir
that
i
am
extremely
anxious
to
give
satisfaction
if
you
would
take
me
back
and
inform
me
how
i
have
fallen
short
i
would
endeavour
to
improve
i
ca
stop
here
all
night
interrupted
mr
ferguson
bounding
from
his
chair
and
beginning
to
pace
the
floor
presumption
sir
i
feel
that
if
you
were
to
give
me
another
chance
i
should
work
to
your
satisfaction
i
should
endeavour
mr
ferguson
stared
at
him
in
dumb
horror
he
had
a
momentary
vision
of
a
sleepless
night
spent
in
listening
to
a
speech
for
the
defence
he
was
seized
with
a
mad
desire
for
flight
he
could
not
leave
the
building
but
he
must
get
away
somewhere
and
think
he
dashed
from
the
room
and
raced
up
the
dark
stairs
and
as
he
arrived
at
the
next
floor
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
thin
pencil
of
light
which
proceeded
from
a
door
on
the
left
no
shipwrecked
mariner
on
a
desert
island
could
have
welcomed
the
appearance
of
a
sail
with
greater
enthusiasm
he
bounded
at
the
door
he
knew
to
whom
the
room
belonged
it
was
the
office
of
one
blaythwayt
and
blaythwayt
was
not
only
an
acquaintance
but
a
sportsman
quite
possibly
there
might
be
a
pack
of
cards
on
blaythwayt
person
to
help
pass
the
long
hours
and
if
not
at
least
he
would
be
company
and
his
office
a
refuge
he
flung
open
the
door
without
going
through
the
formality
of
knocking
etiquette
is
not
for
the
marooned
say
blaythwayt
he
began
and
stopped
abruptly
the
only
occupant
of
the
room
was
a
girl
beg
your
pardon
he
said
thought
he
stopped
again
his
eyes
dazzled
with
the
light
had
not
seen
clearly
they
did
so
now
he
cried
the
girl
looked
at
him
first
with
surprise
then
with
a
cool
hostility
there
was
a
long
pause
eighteen
months
had
passed
since
they
had
parted
and
conversation
does
not
flow
easily
after
eighteen
months
of
silence
especially
if
the
nature
of
the
parting
has
been
bitter
and
stormy
he
was
the
first
to
speak
are
you
doing
here
he
said
thought
my
doings
had
ceased
to
interest
you
she
said
am
mr
blaythwayt
secretary
i
have
been
here
a
fortnight
i
have
wondered
if
we
should
meet
i
used
to
see
you
sometimes
in
the
street
never
saw
you
she
said
indifferently
he
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
in
a
dazed
way
you
know
we
are
locked
in
he
said
he
had
expected
wild
surprise
and
dismay
she
merely
clicked
her
tongue
in
an
annoyed
manner
she
said
a
nuisance
i
was
locked
in
only
a
week
ago
he
looked
at
her
with
unwilling
respect
the
respect
of
the
novice
for
the
veteran
she
was
nothing
to
him
now
of
course
she
had
passed
out
of
his
life
but
he
could
not
help
remembering
that
long
ago
eighteen
months
ago
what
he
had
admired
most
in
her
had
been
this
same
spirit
this
game
refusal
to
be
disturbed
by
fate
blows
it
braced
him
up
he
sat
down
and
looked
curiously
at
her
you
left
the
stage
he
said
thought
we
agreed
when
we
parted
not
to
speak
to
one
another
said
she
coldly
we
i
thought
it
was
only
to
meet
as
strangers
the
same
thing
it
i
often
talk
to
strangers
a
bore
they
must
think
you
she
said
hiding
of
a
yawn
with
the
tips
of
two
fingers
suppose
she
went
on
with
faint
interest
talk
to
them
in
trains
when
they
are
trying
to
read
their
paper
do
force
my
conversation
on
anyone
you
she
said
raising
her
eyebrows
in
sweet
surprise
your
company
is
that
it
you
alluding
to
the
present
occasion
you
have
an
office
of
your
own
in
this
building
i
believe
have
why
am
at
perfect
liberty
he
said
with
dignity
sit
in
my
friend
blaythwayt
office
if
i
choose
i
wish
to
see
mr
blaythwayt
business
he
proved
that
she
had
established
no
corner
in
raised
eyebrows
fear
he
said
i
can
not
discuss
my
affairs
with
mr
blaythwayt
employees
i
must
see
him
personally
blaythwayt
is
not
here
will
wait
will
not
be
here
for
thirteen
hours
i
wait
well
she
burst
out
have
brought
it
on
yourself
only
yourself
to
blame
if
you
had
been
good
and
had
gone
back
to
your
office
i
would
have
brought
you
down
some
cake
and
cocoa
and
cocoa
said
he
superciliously
cake
and
cocoa
she
snapped
all
very
well
for
you
to
turn
up
your
nose
at
them
now
but
wait
you
thirteen
hours
of
this
in
front
of
you
i
know
what
it
is
last
time
i
had
to
spend
the
night
here
i
could
get
to
sleep
for
hours
and
when
i
did
i
dreamed
that
i
was
chasing
chocolate
round
and
round
trafalgar
square
and
i
never
caught
them
either
long
before
the
night
was
finished
i
would
have
given
for
even
a
dry
biscuit
i
made
up
my
mind
i
always
keep
something
here
in
case
i
ever
got
locked
in
again
yes
smile
you
better
while
you
can
he
was
smiling
but
wanly
nobody
but
a
professional
fasting
man
could
have
looked
unmoved
into
the
inferno
she
had
pictured
then
he
rallied
he
said
scornfully
she
nodded
grimly
again
that
nod
ineffably
sinister
afraid
i
do
care
for
either
he
said
you
will
excuse
me
she
said
indifferently
have
a
little
work
that
i
must
finish
she
turned
to
her
desk
leaving
him
to
his
thoughts
they
were
not
exhilarating
he
had
maintained
a
brave
front
but
inwardly
he
quailed
reared
in
the
country
he
had
developed
at
an
early
age
a
fine
healthy
appetite
once
soon
after
his
arrival
in
london
he
had
allowed
a
dangerous
fanatic
to
persuade
him
that
the
secret
of
health
was
to
go
without
breakfast
his
lunch
that
day
had
cost
him
eight
shillings
and
only
decent
shame
had
kept
the
figure
as
low
as
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
long
ere
the
dawn
of
day
his
whole
soul
would
be
crying
out
for
cake
squealing
frantically
for
cocoa
would
it
not
be
better
to
no
a
thousand
times
no
death
but
not
surrender
his
was
at
stake
looking
back
he
saw
that
his
entire
relations
with
this
girl
had
been
a
series
of
battles
of
will
so
far
though
he
had
certainly
not
won
he
had
not
been
defeated
he
must
not
be
defeated
now
he
crossed
his
legs
and
sang
a
gay
air
under
his
breath
you
would
mind
said
the
girl
looking
up
beg
your
pardon
groaning
interrupts
my
work
was
not
groaning
i
was
singing
i
sorry
at
all
eight
bars
rest
mr
ferguson
deprived
of
the
solace
of
song
filled
in
the
time
by
gazing
at
the
toiler
it
set
in
motion
a
train
of
thought
an
express
train
bound
for
the
land
of
yesterday
it
recalled
days
in
the
woods
evenings
on
the
lawn
it
recalled
sunshine
storm
plenty
of
storm
minor
tempests
that
burst
from
a
clear
sky
apparently
without
cause
and
the
great
final
tornado
there
had
been
cause
enough
for
that
why
was
it
mused
mr
ferguson
that
every
girl
in
every
country
town
in
every
county
of
england
who
had
ever
recited
shall
not
ring
tonight
well
enough
to
escape
lynching
at
the
hands
of
a
rustic
audience
was
seized
with
the
desire
to
come
to
london
and
go
on
the
stage
he
sighed
do
snort
said
a
cold
voice
from
behind
the
there
was
a
in
the
land
of
yesterday
mr
ferguson
the
only
survivor
limped
back
into
the
present
the
present
had
little
charm
but
at
least
it
was
better
than
the
cakeless
future
he
fixed
his
thoughts
on
it
he
wondered
how
master
bean
was
passing
the
time
probably
doing
exercises
or
reading
a
pocket
aristotle
the
girl
pushed
back
her
chair
and
rose
she
went
to
a
small
cupboard
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
from
it
produced
in
instalments
all
that
goes
to
make
cake
and
cocoa
she
did
not
speak
presently
filling
space
there
sprang
into
being
an
odour
and
as
it
reached
him
mr
ferguson
stiffened
in
his
chair
bracing
himself
as
for
a
fight
to
the
death
it
was
more
than
an
odour
it
was
the
soul
of
the
cocoa
singing
to
him
his
fingers
gripped
the
arms
of
the
chair
this
was
the
test
the
girl
separated
a
section
of
cake
from
the
parent
body
she
caught
his
eye
had
better
go
she
said
you
go
now
it
just
possible
that
i
may
but
i
forgot
you
do
like
cocoa
said
he
resolutely
do
she
seemed
now
in
the
mood
for
conversation
wonder
why
you
came
up
here
at
all
she
said
no
reason
why
you
should
know
i
came
up
here
because
my
late
is
downstairs
should
that
send
you
up
never
met
him
or
you
would
ask
have
you
ever
had
to
face
someone
who
is
simply
incarnate
saintliness
and
disapproval
who
you
forgetting
that
i
was
engaged
to
you
for
several
weeks
he
was
too
startled
to
be
hurt
the
idea
of
himself
as
a
roland
bean
was
too
new
to
be
assimilated
immediately
it
called
for
meditation
i
like
that
he
said
at
last
almost
humbly
know
you
were
oh
i
not
thinking
only
about
your
views
on
the
stage
it
was
everything
whatever
i
did
you
were
there
to
disapprove
like
a
like
a
like
an
aunt
she
concluded
triumphantly
were
too
good
for
anything
if
only
you
would
just
once
have
done
something
wrong
i
think
i
have
but
you
could
you
simply
perfect
a
man
will
remain
cool
and
composed
under
many
charges
hint
that
his
tastes
are
criminal
and
he
will
shrug
his
shoulders
but
accuse
him
of
goodness
and
you
rouse
the
lion
mr
ferguson
brow
darkened
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
haughtily
was
to
have
had
supper
with
a
this
very
night
very
appalling
said
she
languidly
she
sipped
her
cocoa
suppose
you
consider
that
very
terrible
she
said
a
beginner
she
crumbled
her
cake
suddenly
she
looked
up
is
she
she
demanded
fiercely
beg
your
pardon
he
said
coming
out
of
a
pleasant
reverie
is
this
girl
er
her
name
her
name
is
marie
marie
templeton
she
seemed
to
think
for
a
moment
dear
old
lady
she
said
i
know
her
quite
well
mother
we
used
to
call
her
have
you
met
her
son
son
rather
man
he
plays
heavy
parts
on
tour
he
married
and
has
two
of
the
sweetest
children
their
grandmother
is
devoted
to
them
has
she
ever
mentioned
them
to
you
she
poured
herself
out
another
cup
of
cocoa
conversation
again
languished
suppose
you
very
fond
of
her
she
said
at
length
devoted
to
her
he
paused
little
thing
he
added
she
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
there
was
a
nasty
gleam
in
her
eyes
are
going
he
said
shall
be
back
in
a
moment
i
just
going
to
bring
your
poor
little
up
here
he
must
be
missing
you
he
sprang
up
but
she
had
gone
leaning
over
the
banisters
he
heard
a
door
open
below
then
a
short
conversation
and
finally
footsteps
climbing
the
stairs
it
was
pitch
dark
on
the
landing
he
stepped
aside
and
they
passed
without
seeing
him
master
bean
was
discoursing
easily
on
cocoa
the
processes
whereby
it
was
manufactured
and
the
remarkable
distances
which
natives
of
mexico
had
covered
with
it
as
their
only
food
the
door
opened
flooding
the
landing
with
light
and
mr
ferguson
stepping
from
ambush
began
to
descend
the
stairs
the
girl
came
to
the
banisters
ferguson
he
stopped
you
want
me
he
asked
you
going
back
to
your
office
am
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
bean
society
he
has
a
fund
of
useful
information
on
all
subjects
he
went
on
after
a
while
she
returned
to
the
room
and
closed
the
door
mr
ferguson
went
into
his
office
and
sat
down
there
was
once
a
person
of
the
name
of
simeon
stylites
who
took
up
a
position
on
top
of
a
pillar
and
stayed
there
having
no
other
engagements
for
thirty
years
mr
ferguson
who
had
read
poem
on
the
subject
had
until
tonight
looked
upon
this
as
a
pretty
good
thing
reading
the
lines
thrice
ten
years
thrice
multiplied
by
superhuman
pangs
in
hunger
and
in
thirsts
fevers
and
colds
in
coughs
aches
stitches
ulcerous
throes
and
cramps
patient
on
this
tall
pillar
i
have
borne
rain
wind
frost
heat
hail
damp
and
sleet
and
snow
he
had
gathered
roughly
as
it
were
that
simeon
had
not
been
comfortable
he
had
pitied
him
but
now
sitting
in
his
he
began
to
wonder
what
the
man
had
made
such
a
fuss
about
he
suspected
him
of
having
had
a
touch
of
the
white
feather
in
him
it
was
not
as
if
he
had
not
had
food
he
talked
about
and
thirsts
but
he
must
have
had
something
to
eat
or
he
could
not
have
stayed
the
course
very
likely
if
the
truth
were
known
there
was
somebody
below
who
passed
him
up
regular
supplies
of
cake
and
cocoa
he
began
to
look
on
simeon
as
an
overrated
amateur
sleep
refused
to
come
to
him
it
got
as
far
as
his
feet
but
no
farther
he
rose
and
stamped
to
restore
the
circulation
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
definitely
condemned
simeon
stylites
as
a
sybaritic
fraud
if
this
were
one
of
those
realistic
zolaesque
stories
i
would
describe
the
crick
in
the
back
that
but
let
us
hurry
on
it
was
about
six
hours
later
he
had
no
watch
but
the
numbers
of
aches
stitches
not
to
mention
cramps
that
he
had
experienced
could
not
possibly
have
been
condensed
into
a
shorter
period
that
his
manly
spirit
snapped
let
us
not
judge
him
too
harshly
the
girl
upstairs
had
broken
his
heart
ruined
his
life
and
practically
compared
him
to
roland
bean
and
his
pride
should
have
built
up
an
impassable
wall
between
them
but
she
had
cake
and
cocoa
in
similar
circumstances
king
arthur
would
have
grovelled
before
guinevere
he
rushed
to
the
door
and
tore
it
open
there
was
a
startled
exclamation
from
the
darkness
outside
hope
i
did
disturb
you
said
a
meek
voice
mr
ferguson
did
not
answer
his
twitching
nostrils
were
drinking
in
a
familiar
aroma
you
asleep
may
i
come
in
i
brought
you
some
cake
and
cocoa
he
took
the
rich
gifts
from
her
in
silence
there
are
moments
in
a
man
life
too
sacred
for
words
the
wonder
of
the
thing
had
struck
him
dumb
an
instant
before
and
he
had
had
but
a
desperate
hope
of
winning
these
priceless
things
from
her
at
the
cost
of
all
his
dignity
and
he
had
been
prepared
to
secure
them
through
a
shower
of
biting
taunts
a
blizzard
of
told
you
so
yet
here
he
was
draining
the
cup
and
still
able
to
hold
his
head
up
look
the
world
in
the
face
and
call
himself
a
man
his
keen
eye
detected
a
crumb
on
his
this
retrieved
and
consumed
he
turned
to
her
seeking
explanation
she
was
changed
the
had
faded
from
her
eyes
she
seemed
scared
and
subdued
her
manner
was
of
one
craving
comfort
and
protection
awful
boy
she
breathed
said
mr
ferguson
picking
a
crumb
off
the
carpet
frightful
thought
you
might
get
a
little
tired
of
him
what
has
he
been
doing
i
feel
battered
he
like
one
of
those
awful
encyclopedias
that
give
you
a
sort
of
dull
leaden
feeling
in
your
head
directly
you
open
them
do
you
know
how
many
tons
of
water
go
over
niagara
falls
every
year
does
told
you
he
had
a
fund
of
useful
information
the
purpose
and
tenacity
books
insist
on
it
that
how
you
catch
your
employer
eye
one
morning
the
boss
suddenly
wants
to
know
how
many
horsehair
sofas
there
are
in
brixton
the
number
of
pins
that
would
reach
from
london
bridge
to
waterloo
you
tell
him
and
he
takes
you
into
partnership
later
you
become
a
millionaire
but
i
have
thanked
you
for
the
cocoa
it
was
fine
he
waited
for
the
retort
but
it
did
not
come
a
pleased
wonderment
filled
him
could
these
things
really
be
thus
it
is
only
what
he
says
she
went
on
know
what
you
mean
about
him
now
it
his
accusing
manner
tried
to
analyse
that
manner
i
believe
it
the
spectacles
frightful
when
he
looks
at
you
you
think
of
all
the
wrong
things
you
have
ever
done
or
ever
wanted
to
do
he
have
that
effect
on
you
he
said
excitedly
that
exactly
describes
what
i
feel
the
affinities
looked
at
one
another
she
was
the
first
to
speak
always
did
think
alike
on
most
things
did
we
she
said
course
we
did
he
shifted
his
chair
forward
was
all
my
fault
he
said
mean
what
happened
was
it
it
was
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
do
know
if
it
will
make
any
difference
now
but
i
should
like
you
to
know
it
it
this
i
altered
a
good
deal
since
i
came
to
london
for
the
better
i
think
i
a
pretty
poor
sort
of
specimen
still
but
at
least
i
imagine
i
can
measure
life
with
a
i
do
judge
the
world
any
longer
by
the
standards
of
a
country
town
london
has
knocked
some
of
the
corners
off
me
i
do
think
you
would
find
me
the
bean
type
any
longer
i
do
disapprove
of
other
people
much
now
not
as
a
habit
i
find
i
have
enough
to
do
keeping
myself
up
to
the
mark
want
to
tell
you
something
too
she
said
expect
it
too
late
but
never
mind
i
want
you
to
hear
it
i
altered
too
since
i
came
to
london
i
used
to
think
the
universe
had
been
invented
just
to
look
on
and
wave
its
hat
while
i
did
great
things
london
has
put
a
large
piece
of
cold
ice
against
my
head
and
the
swelling
has
gone
down
not
the
girl
with
ambitions
any
longer
i
just
want
to
keep
employed
and
not
have
too
bad
a
time
when
the
day
work
is
over
he
came
across
to
where
she
sat
said
we
would
meet
as
strangers
and
we
do
we
never
have
known
each
other
do
you
think
we
had
better
get
acquainted
he
said
there
was
a
respectful
tap
at
the
door
in
snapped
mr
ferguson
behind
the
spectacles
of
master
bean
there
shone
a
softer
look
than
usual
a
look
rather
complacent
than
disapproving
must
apologize
sir
for
intruding
upon
you
i
am
no
longer
in
your
employment
but
i
do
hope
that
in
the
circumstances
you
will
forgive
my
entering
your
private
office
thinking
over
our
situation
just
now
an
idea
came
to
me
by
means
of
which
i
fancy
we
might
be
enabled
to
leave
the
building
occurred
to
me
sir
that
by
telephoning
to
the
nearest
heavens
cried
mr
ferguson
two
minutes
later
he
replaced
the
receiver
all
right
he
said
made
them
understand
the
trouble
they
bringing
a
ladder
i
wonder
what
the
time
is
it
must
be
about
four
in
the
morning
master
bean
produced
a
waterbury
watch
time
sir
is
almost
exactly
half
past
ten
past
ten
we
must
have
been
here
longer
than
three
hours
your
watch
is
wrong
sir
i
am
very
careful
to
keep
it
exactly
right
i
do
not
wish
to
run
any
risk
of
being
unpunctual
past
ten
cried
mr
ferguson
we
in
heaps
of
time
to
look
in
at
the
savoy
for
supper
this
is
great
i
phone
them
to
keep
a
table
i
thought
she
stopped
that
thought
what
you
an
engagement
for
supper
he
stared
at
her
gave
you
that
idea
of
course
not
thought
you
said
you
were
taking
miss
templeton
temp
oh
his
face
cleared
there
is
such
a
person
i
invented
her
i
had
to
when
you
accused
me
of
being
like
our
friend
the
miasma
legitimate
do
not
wish
to
interrupt
you
sir
when
you
are
busy
said
master
bean
and
see
me
tomorrow
morning
said
mr
ferguson
said
the
girl
as
the
first
threatening
mutters
from
the
orchestra
heralded
an
imminent
storm
of
melody
that
boy
comes
tomorrow
what
are
going
to
do
up
the
police
but
you
must
do
something
we
should
have
been
here
if
it
had
been
for
him
true
he
pondered
got
it
i
get
him
a
job
with
raikes
and
courtenay
raikes
and
courtenay
i
have
a
pull
with
them
but
principally
said
mr
ferguson
with
a
devilish
grin
they
live
in
edinburgh
which
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
is
a
long
long
way
from
london
he
bent
across
the
table
this
like
old
times
he
said
you
remember
the
first
time
i
ever
ki
just
then
the
orchestra
broke
out
the
good
angel
any
man
under
thirty
years
of
age
who
tells
you
he
is
not
afraid
of
an
english
butler
lies
he
may
not
show
his
fear
outwardly
he
may
be
brave
aggressive
even
perhaps
to
the
extent
of
calling
the
great
man
or
but
in
his
heart
when
he
meets
that
cold
blue
introspective
eye
he
quakes
the
effect
that
keggs
the
butler
at
the
keiths
had
on
martin
rossiter
was
to
make
him
feel
as
if
he
had
been
caught
laughing
in
a
cathedral
he
fought
against
the
feeling
he
asked
himself
who
keggs
was
anyway
and
replied
defiantly
that
keggs
was
a
menial
and
an
overfed
menial
but
all
the
while
he
knew
that
logic
was
useless
when
the
keiths
had
invited
him
to
their
country
home
he
had
been
delighted
they
were
among
his
oldest
friends
he
liked
mr
keith
he
liked
mrs
keith
he
loved
elsa
keith
and
had
done
so
from
boyhood
but
things
had
gone
wrong
as
he
leaned
out
of
his
bedroom
window
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
preparatory
to
dressing
for
dinner
he
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
make
some
excuse
and
get
right
out
of
the
place
next
day
the
bland
dignity
of
keggs
had
taken
all
the
heart
out
of
him
nor
was
it
keggs
alone
who
had
driven
his
thoughts
towards
flight
keggs
was
merely
a
passive
evil
like
toothache
or
a
rainy
day
what
had
begun
actively
to
make
the
place
impossible
was
a
perfectly
pestilential
young
man
of
the
name
of
barstowe
the
at
the
keiths
had
originally
been
from
almost
ideal
the
rest
of
the
men
were
of
the
speechless
breed
they
had
come
to
shoot
and
they
shot
when
they
were
not
shooting
they
congregated
in
the
and
devoted
their
powerful
intellects
exclusively
to
leaving
martin
free
to
talk
undisturbed
to
elsa
he
had
been
doing
this
for
five
days
with
great
contentment
when
aubrey
barstowe
arrived
mrs
keith
had
developed
of
late
leanings
towards
culture
in
her
town
house
a
charge
of
fired
in
any
direction
on
a
thursday
afternoon
could
not
have
failed
to
bring
down
a
poet
a
novelist
or
a
painter
aubrey
barstowe
author
of
soul
and
other
poems
was
a
constant
member
of
the
crowd
a
youth
of
insinuating
manners
he
had
appealed
to
mrs
keith
from
the
start
and
unfortunately
the
virus
had
extended
to
elsa
many
a
pleasant
sunshiny
thursday
afternoon
had
been
poisoned
for
martin
by
the
sight
of
aubrey
and
elsa
together
on
a
distant
settee
matching
temperaments
the
rest
is
too
painful
it
was
a
rout
the
poet
did
not
shoot
so
that
when
martin
returned
of
an
evening
his
rival
was
about
five
hours
of
talk
up
and
only
two
to
play
and
those
two
the
hours
which
had
once
been
the
hours
for
which
martin
had
lived
were
pure
torture
so
engrossed
was
he
with
his
thoughts
that
the
first
intimation
he
had
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
room
was
a
genteel
cough
behind
him
holding
a
small
can
was
keggs
water
sir
said
the
butler
austerely
but
not
unkindly
keggs
was
a
man
one
must
use
that
word
though
it
seems
grossly
inadequate
of
medium
height
at
the
base
bulgy
up
and
bald
at
the
apex
his
manner
was
restrained
and
dignified
his
voice
soft
and
grave
but
it
was
his
eye
that
quelled
martin
that
cold
blue
eye
he
fixed
it
upon
him
now
as
he
added
placing
the
can
on
the
floor
is
frederick
duty
but
tonight
i
hundertook
it
martin
had
no
answer
he
was
dazed
keggs
had
spoken
with
the
proud
humility
of
an
emperor
compelled
by
misfortune
to
shine
shoes
i
have
a
word
with
you
sir
yes
stammered
martin
you
take
a
i
mean
yes
certainly
is
perhaps
a
liberty
began
keggs
he
paused
and
raked
martin
with
the
eye
that
had
rested
on
dining
dukes
at
all
said
martin
hurriedly
should
like
went
on
keggs
bowing
speak
to
you
on
a
somewhat
intimate
subject
miss
elsa
martin
eyes
and
mouth
opened
slowly
are
going
the
wrong
way
to
work
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
sir
martin
jaw
dropped
another
inch
sir
proceeded
keggs
ladies
are
peculiar
i
have
had
if
i
may
say
so
certain
hopportunities
of
observing
their
ways
miss
elsa
reminds
me
in
some
respects
of
lady
angelica
fendall
whom
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
when
i
was
butler
to
her
father
lord
stockleigh
her
ladyship
was
hinclined
to
be
romantic
she
was
fond
of
poetry
like
miss
elsa
she
would
sit
by
the
hour
sir
listening
to
young
mr
knox
reading
tennyson
which
was
no
part
of
his
duties
he
being
employed
by
his
lordship
to
teach
lord
bertie
latin
and
greek
and
what
not
you
may
have
noticed
sir
that
young
ladies
is
often
took
by
tennyson
hespecially
in
the
summertime
mr
barstowe
was
reading
tennyson
to
miss
elsa
in
the
when
i
passed
through
just
now
if
i
am
not
mistaken
do
know
what
the
thing
was
groaned
martin
seemed
to
be
enjoying
it
angelica
was
greatly
addicted
to
young
mr
knox
was
reading
portions
of
that
poem
to
her
when
his
lordship
come
upon
them
most
rashly
his
lordship
made
a
public
hexpose
and
packed
mr
knox
off
next
day
it
was
not
my
place
to
volunteer
advice
but
i
could
have
told
him
what
would
happen
two
days
later
her
ladyship
slips
away
to
london
early
in
the
morning
and
they
married
at
a
that
is
why
i
say
that
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
to
work
with
miss
elsa
sir
with
certain
types
of
spirited
young
lady
hopposition
is
useless
now
when
mr
barstowe
was
reading
to
miss
elsa
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
alluded
you
were
sitting
by
trying
to
engage
her
attention
it
not
the
way
sir
you
should
leave
them
alone
together
let
her
see
so
much
of
him
and
nobody
else
but
him
that
she
will
grow
tired
of
him
fondness
for
poetry
sir
is
very
much
like
the
whisky
you
ca
cure
a
man
what
has
got
that
by
hopposition
now
if
you
will
permit
me
to
offer
a
word
of
advice
sir
i
say
let
miss
elsa
all
the
poetry
she
wants
martin
was
conscious
of
one
coherent
feeling
at
the
conclusion
of
this
address
and
that
was
one
of
amazed
gratitude
a
lesser
man
who
had
entered
his
room
and
begun
to
discuss
his
private
affairs
would
have
had
reason
to
retire
with
some
speed
but
that
keggs
should
descend
from
his
pedestal
and
interest
himself
in
such
lowly
matters
was
a
different
thing
altogether
very
much
obliged
he
was
stammering
when
the
butler
raised
a
deprecatory
hand
interest
in
the
matter
he
said
smoothly
not
entirely
haltruistic
for
some
years
back
in
fact
since
miss
elsa
came
out
we
have
had
a
matrimonial
sweepstake
in
the
servants
hall
at
each
the
names
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
party
are
placed
in
a
hat
and
drawn
in
due
course
should
miss
elsa
become
engaged
to
any
member
of
the
party
the
pool
goes
to
the
drawer
of
his
name
should
no
engagement
occur
the
money
remains
in
my
charge
until
the
following
year
when
it
is
added
to
the
new
pool
hitherto
i
have
the
misfortune
to
draw
nothing
but
married
gentlemen
but
on
this
occasion
i
have
secured
you
sir
and
i
may
tell
you
sir
he
added
with
stately
courtesy
in
the
opinion
of
the
servants
hall
your
chances
are
fancied
very
the
pool
has
now
reached
considerable
proportions
and
had
certain
losses
on
the
turf
very
recent
i
am
extremely
anxious
to
win
it
so
i
thought
if
i
might
take
the
liberty
sir
i
would
place
my
knowledge
of
the
sex
at
your
disposal
you
will
find
it
sound
in
every
respect
that
is
all
thank
you
sir
martin
feelings
had
undergone
a
complete
revulsion
in
the
last
few
minutes
the
butler
had
shed
his
wings
and
grown
horns
cloven
feet
and
a
forked
tail
his
rage
deprived
him
of
words
he
could
only
gurgle
thank
me
sir
said
the
butler
indulgently
ask
no
thanks
we
are
working
together
for
a
common
hobject
and
any
little
i
can
provide
is
given
freely
old
scoundrel
shouted
martin
his
wrath
prevailing
even
against
that
blue
eye
have
the
insolence
to
come
to
me
and
he
stopped
the
thought
of
these
hounds
these
demons
coolly
gossiping
and
speculating
below
stairs
about
elsa
making
her
the
subject
of
little
sporting
flutters
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
country
life
choked
him
shall
tell
mr
keith
he
said
the
butler
shook
his
bald
head
gravely
should
sir
it
is
a
fantastic
story
and
i
do
think
he
would
believe
it
i
oh
get
out
keggs
bowed
deferentially
you
wish
it
sir
he
said
will
withdraw
if
i
may
make
the
suggestion
sir
i
think
you
should
commence
to
dress
dinner
will
be
served
in
a
few
minutes
thank
you
sir
he
passed
softly
out
of
the
room
it
was
more
as
a
demonstration
of
defiance
against
keggs
than
because
he
really
hoped
that
anything
would
come
of
it
that
martin
approached
elsa
next
morning
after
breakfast
elsa
was
strolling
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
with
the
bard
but
martin
broke
in
on
the
conference
with
the
dogged
determination
of
a
out
with
the
guns
today
elsa
he
said
she
raised
her
eyes
there
was
an
absent
look
in
them
guns
she
said
no
i
hate
watching
men
shoot
used
to
like
it
used
to
like
dolls
she
said
impatiently
mr
barstowe
gave
tongue
he
was
a
slim
tall
sickeningly
beautiful
young
man
with
large
dark
eyes
full
of
expression
develop
he
said
years
go
by
and
we
develop
our
souls
expand
timidly
at
first
like
little
birds
stealing
out
from
the
do
know
that
i
so
set
on
shooting
today
myself
said
martin
you
come
round
the
links
am
going
out
in
the
motor
with
mr
barstowe
said
elsa
motor
cried
mr
barstowe
rossiter
that
is
the
very
poetry
of
motion
i
never
ride
in
a
without
those
words
of
shakespeare
ringing
in
my
mind
i
put
a
girdle
round
about
the
earth
in
forty
minutes
should
give
way
to
that
sort
of
thing
if
i
were
you
said
martin
police
are
pretty
down
on
in
these
parts
barstowe
was
speaking
figuratively
said
elsa
with
disdain
he
grunted
martin
whose
sorrows
were
tending
to
make
him
every
day
more
like
a
sulky
schoolboy
afraid
i
have
got
a
poetic
soul
afraid
you
have
said
elsa
there
was
a
brief
silence
a
bird
made
itself
heard
in
a
neighbouring
tree
the
moan
of
doves
in
immemorial
elms
quoted
mr
barstowe
softly
it
happens
to
be
a
crow
in
a
beech
said
martin
as
the
bird
flew
out
elsa
chin
tilted
itself
in
scorn
martin
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
the
wrong
way
sir
it
the
wrong
way
said
a
voice
was
hobserving
you
from
a
window
sir
it
lady
angelica
over
again
hopposition
is
useless
believe
me
sir
martin
faced
round
flushed
and
wrathful
the
butler
went
on
unmoved
elsa
is
going
for
a
ride
in
the
car
today
sir
know
that
tricky
things
these
i
was
saying
so
to
roberts
the
chauffeur
just
as
soon
as
i
miss
elsa
was
going
out
with
mr
barstowe
i
said
roberts
these
cars
is
tricky
break
down
when
you
twenty
miles
from
hanywhere
as
soon
as
look
at
you
roberts
i
said
slipping
him
a
sovereign
awful
it
would
be
if
the
car
should
break
down
twenty
miles
from
hanywhere
today
martin
stared
bribed
roberts
to
i
gave
roberts
the
sovereign
because
i
am
sorry
for
him
he
is
a
poor
man
and
has
a
wife
and
family
to
support
well
said
martin
sternly
shall
go
and
warn
miss
keith
her
sir
shall
tell
her
that
you
have
bribed
roberts
to
make
the
car
break
down
so
that
keggs
shook
his
head
fear
she
would
hardly
credit
the
statement
sir
she
might
even
think
that
you
was
trying
to
keep
her
from
going
for
your
own
pussonal
ends
believe
you
are
the
devil
said
martin
you
will
come
to
look
on
me
sir
said
keggs
unctuously
your
good
hangel
martin
shot
abominably
that
day
and
coming
home
in
the
evening
gloomy
and
savage
went
straight
to
his
room
and
did
not
reappear
till
elsa
had
been
taken
in
by
one
of
the
martin
found
himself
seated
on
her
other
side
it
was
so
pleasant
to
be
near
her
and
to
feel
that
the
bard
was
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
that
for
the
moment
his
spirits
revived
how
did
you
like
the
ride
he
asked
with
a
smile
you
put
that
girdle
round
the
world
she
looked
at
him
once
the
next
moment
he
had
an
uninterrupted
view
of
her
shoulder
and
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice
as
she
prattled
gaily
to
the
man
on
her
other
side
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
bound
he
understood
now
the
demon
butler
had
had
his
wicked
way
good
heavens
she
had
thought
he
was
taunting
her
he
must
explain
at
once
he
or
sherry
sir
he
looked
up
into
kegg
expressionless
eyes
the
butler
was
wearing
his
mask
there
was
no
sign
of
triumph
in
his
face
sherry
i
mean
hock
no
sherry
neither
this
was
awful
he
must
put
this
right
he
said
she
was
engrossed
in
her
conversation
with
her
neighbour
from
down
the
table
in
a
sudden
lull
in
the
talk
came
the
voice
of
mr
barstowe
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
a
narrative
he
was
saying
had
with
me
a
volume
of
shelley
and
one
of
my
own
little
efforts
i
had
read
miss
keith
the
whole
of
the
latter
and
much
of
the
former
before
the
chauffeur
announced
that
it
was
once
more
possible
said
the
wretched
man
had
no
idea
you
do
think
she
turned
to
him
beg
your
pardon
she
said
very
sweetly
swear
i
did
know
i
mean
i
forgotten
i
mean
she
wrinkled
her
forehead
really
afraid
i
do
understand
mean
about
the
car
breaking
down
car
oh
yes
yes
it
broke
down
we
were
delayed
quite
a
little
while
mr
barstowe
read
me
some
of
his
poems
it
was
perfectly
lovely
i
was
quite
sorry
when
roberts
told
us
we
could
go
on
again
but
do
you
really
mean
to
tell
me
mr
lambert
that
you
and
once
more
the
world
became
all
shoulder
when
the
men
trailed
into
the
presence
of
the
ladies
for
that
brief
seance
on
which
etiquette
insisted
before
permitting
the
stampede
to
the
elsa
was
not
to
be
seen
said
mrs
keith
in
answer
to
martin
question
has
gone
to
bed
the
poor
child
has
a
headache
i
am
afraid
she
had
a
tiring
day
there
was
an
early
start
for
the
guns
next
morning
and
as
elsa
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
martin
had
to
leave
without
seeing
her
his
shooting
was
even
worse
than
it
had
been
on
the
previous
day
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
evening
that
the
party
returned
to
the
house
martin
on
the
way
to
his
room
met
mrs
keith
on
the
stairs
she
appeared
somewhat
agitated
martin
she
said
so
glad
you
back
have
you
seen
anything
of
elsa
she
with
the
guns
the
guns
said
martin
puzzled
have
seen
nothing
of
her
all
day
i
getting
worried
i
ca
think
what
can
have
happened
to
her
are
you
sure
she
was
with
the
guns
certain
did
she
come
in
to
lunch
tom
she
said
as
mr
keith
came
up
so
worried
about
elsa
i
have
seen
her
all
day
i
thought
she
must
be
out
with
the
guns
mr
keith
was
a
man
who
had
built
up
a
large
fortune
mainly
by
consistently
refusing
to
allow
anything
to
agitate
him
he
carried
this
policy
into
private
life
she
in
at
lunch
he
asked
placidly
tell
you
i
have
seen
her
all
day
she
breakfasted
in
her
room
she
was
tired
poor
girl
she
breakfasted
late
said
mr
keith
would
need
any
lunch
she
gone
for
a
stroll
somewhere
you
put
back
dinner
do
you
think
inquired
mrs
keith
anxiously
am
not
good
at
riddles
said
mr
keith
comfortably
i
can
answer
that
one
i
would
not
put
back
dinner
i
would
not
put
back
dinner
for
the
king
elsa
did
not
come
back
for
dinner
nor
was
hers
the
only
vacant
place
mr
barstowe
had
also
vanished
even
mr
keith
calm
was
momentarily
ruffled
by
this
discovery
the
poet
was
not
a
favourite
of
his
it
was
only
reluctantly
that
he
had
consented
to
his
being
invited
at
all
and
the
presumption
being
that
when
two
members
of
a
disappear
simultaneously
they
are
likely
to
be
spending
the
time
in
each
society
he
was
annoyed
elsa
was
not
the
girl
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
of
course
but
he
was
unwontedly
silent
at
dinner
mrs
keith
anxiety
displayed
itself
differently
she
was
frankly
worried
and
mentioned
it
by
the
time
the
fish
had
been
reached
conversation
at
the
table
had
fixed
itself
definitely
on
the
one
topic
is
the
car
this
time
at
any
rate
said
mr
keith
been
out
today
ca
understand
it
said
mrs
keith
for
the
twentieth
time
and
that
was
the
farthest
point
reached
in
the
investigation
of
the
mystery
by
the
time
dinner
was
over
a
spirit
of
unrest
was
abroad
the
company
sat
about
in
uneasy
groups
was
if
not
forgotten
at
any
rate
shelved
somebody
suggested
and
one
or
two
of
the
wandered
rather
aimlessly
out
into
the
darkness
martin
was
standing
in
the
porch
with
mr
keith
when
keggs
approached
as
his
eyes
lit
on
him
martin
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
solidifying
of
the
vague
suspicion
which
had
been
forming
in
his
mind
and
yet
that
suspicion
seemed
so
wild
how
could
keggs
with
the
worst
intentions
have
had
anything
to
do
with
this
he
could
not
forcibly
have
abducted
the
missing
pair
and
kept
them
under
lock
and
key
he
could
not
have
stunned
them
and
left
them
in
a
ditch
nevertheless
looking
at
him
standing
there
in
his
attitude
of
deferential
dignity
with
the
light
from
the
open
door
shining
on
his
bald
head
martin
felt
perfectly
certain
that
he
had
in
some
mysterious
fashion
engineered
the
whole
thing
i
have
a
word
sir
if
you
are
at
leisure
keggs
elsa
sir
kegg
voice
took
on
a
sympathetic
softness
was
not
my
place
sir
to
make
any
remark
while
in
the
but
i
could
not
but
hoverhear
the
conversation
i
gathered
from
remarks
that
was
passed
that
you
was
somewhat
hat
a
loss
to
account
for
miss
elsa
sir
mr
keith
laughed
shortly
gathered
that
eh
keggs
bowed
think
sir
that
possibly
i
may
be
hable
to
throw
light
on
the
matter
cried
mr
keith
scott
man
then
why
did
you
say
so
at
the
time
where
is
she
was
not
my
place
sir
to
henter
into
the
conversation
of
the
said
the
butler
with
a
touch
of
reproof
i
might
speak
now
sir
mr
keith
clutched
at
his
forehead
above
do
you
want
a
signed
permit
to
tell
me
where
my
daughter
is
get
on
man
get
on
think
it
possible
sir
that
miss
elsa
and
mr
barstowe
may
be
on
the
hisland
in
the
lake
sir
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
was
a
picturesque
strip
of
water
some
fifteen
hundred
yards
in
width
and
a
little
less
in
length
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
small
and
densely
wooded
island
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
visitors
at
the
house
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
engage
their
attention
but
during
the
past
week
with
shooting
to
fill
up
the
days
it
had
been
neglected
the
island
said
mr
keith
put
that
idea
into
your
head
to
be
rowing
on
the
lake
this
morning
sir
i
frequently
row
of
a
morning
sir
when
there
are
no
duties
to
detain
me
in
the
i
find
the
hexercise
hadmirable
for
the
i
walk
briskly
to
the
and
yes
i
do
want
a
schedule
of
your
daily
exercises
cut
out
the
athletic
reminiscences
and
come
to
the
point
i
was
rowing
on
the
lake
this
morning
sir
i
to
see
a
boat
up
to
a
tree
on
the
hisland
i
think
that
possibly
miss
elsa
and
mr
barstowe
might
taken
a
row
out
there
mr
barstowe
would
wish
to
see
the
hisland
sir
bein
romantic
you
say
you
saw
the
boat
there
this
morning
sir
it
does
take
all
day
to
explore
a
small
island
what
kept
them
all
this
while
is
possible
sir
that
the
rope
might
not
have
mr
barstowe
if
i
might
say
so
sir
is
one
of
those
himpetuous
literary
pussons
and
possibly
he
homitted
to
see
that
the
knot
was
hadequately
tied
or
his
eye
grave
and
inscrutable
rested
for
a
moment
on
martin
party
might
come
along
and
huntied
it
it
on
purpose
said
mr
keith
on
earth
for
keggs
shook
his
head
deprecatingly
as
one
who
realizing
his
limitations
declines
to
attempt
to
probe
the
hidden
sources
of
human
actions
thought
it
right
sir
to
let
you
know
he
said
i
should
say
so
if
elsa
has
been
kept
starving
all
day
on
that
island
by
that
here
come
along
martin
he
dashed
off
excitedly
into
the
night
martin
remained
for
a
moment
gazing
fixedly
at
the
butler
sir
said
keggs
cordially
my
hinformation
will
prove
of
genuine
hassistance
you
know
what
i
should
like
to
do
to
you
said
martin
slowly
think
i
mr
keith
calling
you
sir
should
like
to
take
you
by
the
scruff
of
your
neck
and
sir
did
you
then
quite
distinct
it
was
martin
gave
up
the
struggle
with
a
sense
of
blank
futility
what
could
you
do
with
a
man
like
this
it
was
like
quarrelling
with
westminster
abbey
should
sir
suggested
keggs
respectfully
think
mr
keith
must
have
met
with
some
haccident
his
surmise
proved
correct
when
martin
came
up
he
found
his
host
seated
on
the
ground
in
evident
pain
my
ankle
in
a
hole
he
explained
briefly
me
an
arm
back
to
the
house
there
a
good
fellow
and
then
run
on
down
to
the
lake
and
see
if
what
keggs
said
is
true
martin
did
as
he
was
requested
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
the
first
half
of
the
commission
was
concerned
as
regarded
the
second
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
make
certain
changes
having
seen
mr
keith
to
his
room
he
put
the
of
the
relief
ship
into
the
good
hands
of
a
group
of
his
fellow
guests
whom
he
discovered
in
the
porch
feelings
towards
her
rescuer
might
be
one
of
unmixed
gratitude
but
it
might
on
the
other
hand
be
one
of
resentment
he
did
not
wish
her
to
connect
him
in
her
mind
with
the
episode
in
any
way
whatsoever
martin
had
once
released
a
dog
from
a
trap
and
the
dog
had
bitten
him
he
had
been
on
an
errand
of
mercy
but
the
dog
had
connected
him
with
his
sufferings
and
acted
accordingly
it
occurred
to
martin
that
frame
of
mind
would
be
uncommonly
like
that
dog
the
set
off
martin
lit
a
cigarette
and
waited
in
the
porch
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
before
anything
happened
but
at
last
as
he
was
lighting
his
fifth
cigarette
there
came
from
the
darkness
the
sound
of
voices
they
drew
nearer
someone
shouted
all
right
we
found
them
martin
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
went
indoors
elsa
keith
sat
up
as
her
mother
came
into
the
room
two
nights
and
a
day
had
passed
since
she
had
taken
to
her
bed
are
you
feeling
today
dear
he
gone
mother
barstowe
dear
he
left
this
morning
he
said
he
had
business
with
his
publisher
in
london
i
can
get
up
said
elsa
thankfully
think
you
a
little
hard
on
poor
mr
barstowe
elsa
it
was
just
an
accident
you
know
it
was
not
his
fault
that
the
boat
slipped
away
was
it
was
it
cried
elsa
thumping
the
pillow
malignantly
believe
he
did
it
on
purpose
so
that
he
could
read
me
his
horrid
poetry
without
my
having
a
chance
to
escape
i
believe
that
the
only
way
he
can
get
people
to
listen
to
it
you
used
to
like
it
darling
you
said
he
had
such
a
musical
voice
voice
the
pillow
became
a
shapeless
heap
it
was
like
a
nightmare
if
i
had
seen
him
again
i
should
have
had
hysterics
it
was
if
he
had
been
even
the
least
bit
upset
himself
i
think
i
could
have
borne
up
but
he
it
he
in
it
he
said
it
was
like
omar
khayyam
in
the
wilderness
and
whatever
that
is
and
he
prattled
on
and
on
and
read
and
read
till
my
head
began
to
split
mother
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
hit
him
did
she
went
on
defiantly
hit
him
as
hard
as
i
could
and
he
he
she
broke
off
into
a
little
gurgle
of
laughter
tripped
over
a
bush
and
fell
right
down
and
i
was
a
bit
ashamed
i
think
it
unladylike
or
anything
i
was
just
as
proud
as
i
could
be
and
it
stopped
him
talking
elsa
why
sun
had
just
gone
down
and
it
was
a
lovely
sunset
and
the
sky
looked
like
a
great
beautiful
slice
of
underdone
beef
and
i
said
so
to
him
and
he
said
sniffily
that
he
was
afraid
he
did
see
the
resemblance
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
starving
and
he
said
no
because
as
a
rule
all
that
he
needed
was
a
little
ripe
fruit
and
that
was
when
i
hit
him
i
know
it
was
awfully
wrong
but
i
just
had
to
and
now
i
get
up
it
looks
lovely
out
martin
had
not
gone
out
with
the
guns
that
day
mrs
keith
had
assured
him
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
elsa
that
she
was
only
tired
but
he
was
anxious
and
had
remained
at
home
where
bulletins
could
reach
him
as
he
was
returning
from
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
he
heard
his
name
called
and
saw
elsa
lying
in
the
hammock
under
the
trees
near
the
terrace
martin
why
are
you
out
with
the
guns
she
said
wanted
to
be
on
the
spot
so
that
i
could
hear
how
you
were
nice
of
you
why
do
you
sit
down
i
elsa
fluttered
the
pages
of
her
magazine
know
you
a
very
restful
person
martin
you
so
big
and
outdoory
how
would
you
like
to
read
to
me
for
a
while
i
feel
so
lazy
martin
took
the
magazine
shall
i
read
here
a
poem
by
elsa
shuddered
please
no
she
cried
could
bear
it
i
tell
you
what
i
should
love
the
advertisements
there
one
about
sardines
i
started
it
and
it
seemed
splendid
it
at
the
back
somewhere
this
it
langley
and
fielding
sardines
it
martin
began
to
read
langley
and
fielding
sardines
when
you
want
the
daintiest
most
delicious
sardines
go
to
your
grocer
and
say
and
fielding
please
you
will
then
be
sure
of
having
the
finest
norwegian
smoked
sardines
packed
in
the
purest
olive
oil
elsa
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
closed
and
a
soft
smile
of
pleasure
curving
her
mouth
on
she
said
dreamily
nothing
nicer
resumed
martin
with
an
added
touch
of
eloquence
as
the
theme
began
to
develop
for
breakfast
lunch
or
supper
probably
your
grocer
stocks
them
ask
him
if
he
does
not
write
to
us
price
fivepence
per
tin
the
best
sardines
and
the
best
oil
it
she
murmured
her
hand
as
it
swung
touched
his
he
held
it
she
opened
her
eyes
stop
reading
she
said
never
heard
anything
so
soothing
he
bent
towards
her
she
smiled
at
him
her
eyes
were
dancing
i
keith
said
a
quiet
voice
me
to
say
martin
started
away
he
glared
up
furiously
gazing
down
upon
them
stood
keggs
the
butler
face
was
shining
with
a
gentle
benevolence
keith
desired
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
glad
if
miss
elsa
would
come
and
sit
with
him
for
a
while
come
at
once
said
elsa
stepping
from
the
hammock
the
butler
bowed
respectfully
and
turned
away
they
stood
watching
him
as
he
moved
across
the
terrace
a
saintly
old
man
keggs
looks
said
elsa
you
think
so
he
looks
as
if
he
had
never
even
thought
of
doing
anything
he
should
i
wonder
if
he
ever
has
wonder
said
martin
looks
like
a
stout
angel
what
were
you
saying
martin
when
he
came
up
pots
owen
bentley
was
feeling
embarrassed
he
looked
at
mr
sheppherd
and
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
from
standing
on
one
leg
and
twiddling
his
fingers
at
one
period
of
his
career
before
the
influence
of
his
uncle
henry
had
placed
him
in
the
london
and
suburban
bank
owen
had
been
an
actor
on
the
strength
of
a
batting
average
of
point
nought
seven
for
middlesex
he
had
been
engaged
by
the
astute
impresario
to
whom
the
idea
first
occurred
that
if
you
have
got
to
have
young
men
to
chant
are
merry
and
gay
for
this
is
bohemia
in
the
artists
ball
scene
you
might
just
as
well
have
young
men
whose
names
are
known
to
the
public
he
had
not
been
an
actor
long
for
loss
of
form
had
put
him
out
of
cricket
and
the
impresario
had
given
his
place
in
the
next
piece
to
a
googly
bowler
who
had
done
well
in
the
last
varsity
match
but
he
had
been
one
long
enough
to
experience
that
sinking
sensation
which
is
known
as
and
now
as
he
began
to
explain
to
mr
sheppherd
that
he
wished
for
his
consent
to
marry
his
daughter
audrey
he
found
himself
suffering
exactly
the
same
symptoms
from
the
very
start
from
the
moment
when
he
revealed
the
fact
that
his
income
salary
and
private
means
included
amounted
to
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
he
had
realized
that
this
was
going
to
be
one
of
his
failures
it
was
the
gruesome
early
victorianness
of
it
all
that
took
the
heart
out
of
him
mr
sheppherd
had
always
reminded
him
of
a
heavy
father
out
of
a
novel
but
compared
with
his
demeanour
as
he
listened
now
his
attitude
hitherto
had
been
light
and
whimsical
until
this
moment
owen
had
not
imagined
that
this
sort
of
thing
ever
happened
nowadays
outside
the
comic
papers
by
the
end
of
the
second
minute
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
find
himself
sailing
through
the
air
urged
by
mr
sheppherd
boot
his
transit
indicated
by
a
dotted
line
and
a
few
stars
mr
sheppherd
manner
was
inclined
to
bleakness
is
most
unfortunate
he
said
unfortunate
i
have
my
daughter
happiness
to
consider
it
is
my
duty
as
a
father
he
paused
say
you
have
no
prospects
i
should
have
supposed
that
your
uncle
surely
with
his
influence
uncle
shot
his
bolt
when
he
got
me
into
the
bank
that
finished
him
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
not
his
only
nephew
you
know
there
are
about
a
hundred
others
all
trailing
him
like
bloodhounds
mr
sheppherd
coughed
the
small
cough
of
disapproval
he
was
feeling
more
than
a
little
aggrieved
he
had
met
owen
for
the
first
time
at
dinner
at
the
house
of
his
uncle
henry
a
man
of
unquestioned
substance
whose
habit
it
was
to
invite
each
of
his
eleven
nephews
to
dinner
once
a
year
but
mr
sheppherd
did
not
know
this
for
all
he
knew
owen
was
in
the
habit
of
hobnobbing
with
the
great
man
every
night
he
could
not
say
exactly
that
it
was
sharp
practice
on
owen
part
to
accept
his
invitation
to
call
and
having
called
to
continue
calling
long
enough
to
make
the
present
deplorable
situation
possible
but
he
felt
that
it
would
have
been
in
better
taste
for
the
young
man
to
have
effaced
himself
and
behaved
more
like
a
and
less
like
an
heir
am
exceedingly
sorry
for
this
mr
bentley
he
said
you
will
understand
that
i
can
not
it
is
of
course
out
of
the
question
it
would
be
best
in
the
circumstances
i
think
if
you
did
not
see
my
daughter
again
waiting
in
the
passage
outside
said
owen
after
today
owen
left
the
room
audrey
was
hovering
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
door
she
came
quickly
up
to
him
and
his
spirits
rose
as
they
always
did
at
the
sight
of
her
she
said
he
shook
his
head
good
he
said
audrey
considered
the
problem
for
a
moment
and
was
rewarded
with
an
idea
i
go
in
and
cry
would
be
of
any
use
me
what
happened
said
i
must
see
you
again
did
mean
it
thinks
he
did
audrey
reflected
shall
simply
have
to
keep
writing
then
and
we
can
talk
on
the
telephone
that
is
seeing
each
other
has
your
bank
a
telephone
but
all
right
then
i
ring
you
up
every
day
wish
i
could
make
some
money
said
owen
thoughtfully
i
seem
to
be
one
of
those
chaps
who
ca
nothing
i
try
comes
off
i
never
drawn
anything
except
a
blank
in
a
sweep
i
spent
about
two
pounds
on
sixpenny
postal
orders
when
the
limerick
craze
was
on
and
did
win
a
thing
once
when
i
was
on
tour
i
worked
myself
to
a
shadow
dramatizing
a
novel
nothing
came
of
that
either
novel
thing
called
roses
by
a
woman
named
edith
butler
audrey
looked
up
quickly
suppose
you
knew
her
very
well
were
you
great
friends
did
know
her
at
all
i
never
met
her
i
just
happened
to
buy
the
thing
at
a
bookstall
and
thought
it
would
make
a
good
play
i
expect
it
was
pretty
bad
rot
anyhow
she
never
took
the
trouble
to
send
it
back
or
even
to
acknowledge
receipt
she
never
got
it
registered
it
was
a
cat
said
audrey
decidedly
glad
of
it
though
if
another
woman
had
helped
you
make
a
lot
of
money
i
should
have
died
of
jealousy
routine
is
death
to
heroism
for
the
first
few
days
after
his
parting
with
mr
sheppherd
owen
was
in
heroic
mood
full
of
vaguely
dashing
schemes
regarding
the
world
as
his
oyster
and
burning
to
get
at
it
sword
in
hand
but
routine
with
its
ledgers
and
its
and
its
customers
fell
like
a
grey
cloud
athwart
his
horizon
blotting
out
rainbow
visions
of
sudden
wealth
dramatically
won
day
by
day
the
glow
faded
and
hopelessness
grew
if
the
glow
did
not
entirely
fade
it
was
due
to
audrey
who
more
than
fulfilled
her
promise
of
ringing
him
up
on
the
telephone
she
rang
him
up
at
least
once
frequently
several
times
every
day
a
fact
which
was
noted
and
commented
upon
in
a
harshly
critical
spirit
by
the
head
of
his
department
a
man
with
no
soul
and
a
strong
objection
to
doing
his
subordinates
work
for
them
as
a
rule
her
conversation
though
pleasing
was
discursive
and
lacked
central
motive
but
one
morning
she
had
genuine
news
to
impart
her
voice
was
excited
you
seen
the
paper
today
then
listen
i
read
it
out
are
you
listening
this
is
what
it
says
the
piccadilly
theatre
will
reopen
shortly
with
a
dramatized
version
of
miss
edith
butler
popular
novel
prepared
by
the
authoress
herself
a
strong
cast
is
being
engaged
including
and
then
a
lot
of
names
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
owen
am
i
going
to
do
you
see
what
happened
that
awful
woman
has
stolen
your
play
she
has
waited
all
these
years
hoping
you
would
forget
what
are
you
laughing
at
was
laughing
you
were
it
tickled
my
ear
i
ring
off
if
you
do
it
again
you
do
believe
me
well
you
wait
and
see
if
i
not
butler
incapable
of
such
a
thing
there
was
a
slight
pause
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
thought
you
said
you
did
know
her
said
audrey
jealously
do
i
do
said
owen
hastily
i
read
her
books
they
simply
chunks
of
superfatted
sentiment
she
a
sort
of
literary
onion
she
compels
tears
a
woman
like
that
could
steal
a
play
if
she
tried
ca
judge
authors
from
their
books
you
must
go
and
see
the
play
when
it
comes
on
then
you
see
i
right
i
absolutely
certain
that
woman
is
trying
to
swindle
you
do
laugh
in
that
horrid
way
very
well
i
told
you
i
should
ring
off
and
now
i
going
to
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
month
owen
annual
holiday
arrived
the
authorities
of
the
london
and
suburban
bank
were
no
niggards
they
recognized
that
a
man
is
not
a
machine
they
gave
their
employees
ten
days
in
the
year
in
which
to
tone
up
their
systems
for
another
twelve
months
work
owen
spent
his
boyhood
in
the
shropshire
village
of
which
his
father
had
been
rector
and
thither
he
went
when
his
holiday
came
round
to
the
farm
of
one
dorman
he
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
get
to
shropshire
there
is
something
about
the
country
there
with
its
green
fields
and
miniature
rivers
that
soothes
the
wounded
spirit
and
forms
a
pleasant
background
for
sentimental
musings
it
was
comfortable
at
the
farm
the
household
consisted
of
mr
dorman
an
old
acquaintance
his
son
george
and
mr
mother
an
aged
lady
with
a
considerable
local
reputation
as
a
wise
woman
rumour
had
it
that
the
future
held
no
mysteries
for
her
and
it
was
known
that
she
could
cure
warts
bruised
fingers
and
even
the
botts
by
means
of
spells
except
for
these
owen
had
fancied
that
he
was
alone
in
the
house
it
seemed
not
however
there
was
a
primeval
piano
in
his
and
on
the
second
morning
it
suited
his
mood
to
sit
down
at
this
and
sing
the
fruity
pathos
of
which
ballad
appealed
to
him
strongly
at
this
time
accompanying
himself
by
an
ingenious
arrangement
in
three
chords
he
had
hardly
begun
however
when
mr
dorman
appeared
somewhat
agitated
you
do
mind
mr
owen
he
said
forgot
to
tell
you
there
a
gent
boarding
with
me
in
the
room
above
and
he
ca
bear
to
be
disturbed
a
muffled
stamping
from
the
ceiling
bore
out
his
words
a
book
he
is
continued
mr
dorman
caught
young
george
a
clip
over
the
yesterday
for
blowing
his
trumpet
on
the
stairs
gave
him
sixpence
afterwards
and
said
he
skin
him
if
he
ever
did
it
again
so
if
you
do
mind
all
right
said
owen
is
he
of
the
name
of
prosser
owen
could
not
recollect
having
come
across
any
work
by
anyone
of
that
name
but
he
was
not
a
wide
reader
and
whether
the
man
above
was
a
celebrity
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
quiet
never
heard
of
him
he
said
that
no
reason
why
i
should
disturb
him
let
him
rip
i
cut
out
the
musical
effects
in
future
the
days
passed
smoothly
by
the
literary
man
remained
invisible
though
occasionally
audible
tramping
the
floor
in
the
frenzy
of
composition
nor
until
the
last
day
of
his
visit
did
owen
see
old
mrs
dorman
that
she
was
not
unaware
of
his
presence
in
the
house
however
was
indicated
on
the
last
morning
he
was
smoking
an
pipe
at
the
open
window
and
waiting
for
the
that
was
to
take
him
to
the
station
when
george
the
son
of
the
house
entered
george
stood
in
the
doorway
grinned
and
said
said
owen
the
youth
repeated
the
word
again
on
the
second
repetition
light
began
to
creep
in
a
boyhood
spent
in
the
place
added
to
this
ten
days
stay
had
made
owen
something
of
a
linguist
says
would
i
like
grandma
to
do
what
yer
by
ther
cards
is
she
owen
followed
him
into
the
kitchen
where
he
found
mr
dorman
the
farmer
and
seated
at
the
table
fumbling
with
a
pack
of
cards
an
old
woman
whom
he
remembered
well
wants
to
tell
your
fortune
said
mr
dorman
in
a
hoarse
aside
always
will
tell
visitors
fortunes
she
told
mr
prosser
and
he
did
half
like
it
because
she
said
he
be
engaged
in
two
months
and
married
inside
the
year
he
said
wild
horses
would
make
him
do
it
can
tell
me
that
if
she
likes
i
sha
object
here
mr
owen
seed
him
fast
enough
said
the
old
woman
briskly
an
cut
three
times
she
then
performed
mysterious
manoeuvres
with
the
cards
see
pots
o
money
announced
the
sibyl
she
says
it
it
there
right
enough
said
her
son
means
my
bonus
said
owen
that
only
ten
pounds
and
i
lose
it
if
i
late
twice
more
before
christmas
come
sure
enough
said
the
old
woman
and
she
was
still
mumbling
the
encouraging
word
when
owen
left
the
kitchen
and
returned
to
the
he
laughed
rather
ruefully
at
that
moment
he
could
have
found
a
use
for
pots
o
money
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
it
was
a
glorious
morning
the
was
dancing
over
the
meadow
beyond
the
brook
and
from
the
farmyard
came
the
liquid
charawks
of
fowls
it
seemed
wicked
to
leave
these
haunts
of
peace
for
london
on
such
a
day
an
acute
melancholy
seized
him
absently
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
the
prejudices
of
literary
mr
prosser
had
slipped
from
his
mind
softly
at
first
then
gathering
volume
as
the
spirit
of
the
song
gripped
him
he
began
to
sing
he
became
absorbed
he
had
just
for
the
sixth
time
won
through
to
waiting
and
was
doing
some
intricate
work
preparatory
to
starting
over
again
when
a
loaf
of
bread
whizzed
past
his
ear
it
missed
him
by
an
inch
and
crashed
against
a
plaster
statuette
of
the
infant
samuel
on
the
top
of
the
piano
it
was
a
standard
loaf
containing
eighty
per
cent
of
semolina
and
it
practically
wiped
the
infant
samuel
out
of
existence
at
the
same
moment
at
his
back
there
sounded
a
loud
wrathful
snort
he
spun
round
the
door
was
open
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
standing
a
large
man
in
an
attitude
rather
reminiscent
of
ajax
defying
the
lightning
his
hands
trembled
his
beard
bristled
his
eyes
gleamed
ferociously
beneath
enormous
eyebrows
as
owen
turned
he
gave
tongue
in
a
voice
like
the
discharge
of
a
broadside
it
owen
mind
wrenched
too
suddenly
from
the
dreamy
future
to
the
vivid
present
was
not
yet
completely
under
control
he
gaped
that
infernal
noise
roared
the
man
he
shot
through
the
door
banging
it
after
him
and
pounded
up
the
stairs
owen
was
annoyed
the
artistic
temperament
was
all
very
well
but
there
were
limits
it
was
absurd
that
obscure
authors
should
behave
in
this
way
prosser
who
on
earth
was
prosser
had
anyone
ever
heard
of
him
no
yet
here
he
was
going
about
the
country
clipping
small
boys
over
the
and
flinging
loaves
of
bread
at
as
if
he
were
henry
james
or
marie
corelli
owen
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
his
momentary
loss
of
presence
of
mind
if
he
had
only
kept
his
head
he
could
have
taken
a
flying
shot
at
the
man
with
the
it
had
been
within
easy
reach
instead
of
which
he
had
merely
stood
and
gaped
of
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
might
have
been
his
manly
regret
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
mr
dorman
with
the
information
that
the
was
at
the
door
audrey
was
out
of
town
when
owen
arrived
in
london
but
she
returned
a
week
later
the
sound
of
her
voice
through
the
telephone
did
much
to
cure
the
restlessness
from
which
he
had
been
suffering
since
the
conclusion
of
his
holiday
but
the
thought
that
she
was
so
near
yet
so
inaccessible
produced
in
him
a
meditative
melancholy
which
enveloped
him
like
a
cloud
that
would
not
lift
his
manner
became
distrait
he
lost
weight
if
customers
were
not
vaguely
pained
by
his
sad
pale
face
it
was
only
because
the
fierce
rush
of
modern
commercial
life
leaves
your
business
man
little
leisure
for
observing
pallor
in
what
did
pain
them
was
the
gentle
dreaminess
with
which
he
performed
his
duties
he
was
in
the
inward
bills
department
one
of
the
features
of
which
was
the
sudden
inrush
towards
the
end
of
each
afternoon
of
hatless
energetic
young
men
with
leather
bags
strapped
to
their
left
arms
clamouring
for
mysterious
crackling
documents
much
fastened
with
pins
owen
had
never
quite
understood
what
it
was
that
these
young
men
did
want
and
now
his
detached
mind
refused
even
more
emphatically
to
grapple
with
the
problem
he
distributed
the
documents
at
random
with
the
air
of
a
preoccupied
monarch
scattering
largess
to
the
mob
and
the
subsequent
chaos
had
to
be
handled
by
a
wrathful
head
of
the
department
in
person
man
power
of
endurance
is
limited
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
the
overwrought
head
appealed
passionately
for
relief
and
owen
was
removed
to
the
postage
department
where
when
he
had
leisure
from
answering
audrey
telephone
calls
he
entered
the
addresses
of
letters
in
a
large
book
and
took
them
to
the
post
he
was
supposed
also
to
stamp
them
but
a
man
in
love
can
not
think
of
everything
and
he
was
apt
at
times
to
overlook
this
formality
one
morning
receiving
from
one
of
the
bank
messengers
the
usual
intimation
that
a
lady
wished
to
speak
to
him
on
the
telephone
he
went
to
the
box
and
took
up
the
receiver
that
you
owen
owen
i
went
to
last
night
have
you
been
yet
yet
you
must
go
tonight
owen
i
you
wrote
it
perfectly
lovely
i
cried
my
eyes
out
if
you
do
go
tonight
never
speak
to
you
again
even
on
the
telephone
promise
i
you
must
why
suppose
it
yours
it
may
mean
a
fortune
the
stalls
were
simply
packed
i
going
to
ring
up
the
theatre
now
and
engage
a
seat
for
you
and
pay
for
it
myself
i
say
protested
owen
i
shall
i
ca
trust
you
to
go
if
i
do
and
i
ring
up
early
tomorrow
to
hear
all
about
it
owen
left
the
box
somewhat
depressed
life
was
quite
gloomy
enough
as
it
was
without
going
out
of
one
way
to
cry
one
eyes
out
over
sentimental
plays
his
depression
was
increased
by
the
receipt
on
his
return
to
his
department
of
a
message
from
the
manager
stating
that
he
would
like
to
see
mr
bentley
in
his
private
room
for
a
moment
owen
never
enjoyed
these
little
chats
with
authority
out
of
office
hours
in
the
circle
of
his
friends
he
had
no
doubt
the
manager
was
a
delightful
and
entertaining
companion
but
in
his
private
room
his
conversation
was
less
enjoyable
the
manager
was
seated
at
his
table
thoughtfully
regarding
the
ceiling
his
resemblance
to
a
stuffed
trout
always
striking
was
subtly
accentuated
and
owen
an
expert
in
these
matters
felt
that
his
fears
had
been
well
founded
there
was
trouble
in
the
air
somebody
had
been
complaining
of
him
and
he
was
now
about
as
the
phrase
went
to
be
a
large
man
seated
with
his
back
to
the
door
turned
as
he
entered
and
owen
recognized
the
features
of
mr
prosser
the
literary
owen
regarded
him
without
resentment
since
returning
to
london
he
had
taken
the
trouble
of
looking
up
his
name
in
and
had
found
that
he
was
not
so
undistinguished
as
he
had
supposed
he
was
it
appeared
a
regius
professor
and
the
author
of
some
works
on
sociology
a
record
owen
felt
that
almost
justified
and
clipping
in
moments
of
irritation
the
manager
started
to
speak
but
the
man
of
letters
anticipated
him
this
the
fool
he
roared
man
i
have
no
wish
to
be
hard
on
a
congenital
idiot
who
is
not
responsible
for
his
actions
but
i
must
insist
on
an
explanation
i
understand
that
you
are
in
charge
of
the
correspondence
in
this
office
well
during
the
last
week
you
have
three
times
sent
unstamped
letters
to
my
fiancee
miss
vera
delane
woodlands
southbourne
hants
what
the
matter
with
you
do
you
think
she
likes
paying
twopence
a
time
or
what
is
it
owen
mind
leaped
back
at
the
words
they
recalled
something
to
him
then
he
remembered
he
was
conscious
of
a
not
unpleasant
thrill
he
had
not
known
that
he
was
superstitious
but
for
some
reason
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
those
absurd
words
of
mr
dorman
mother
out
of
his
mind
and
here
was
another
prediction
of
hers
equally
improbable
fulfilled
to
the
letter
scott
he
cried
you
going
to
be
married
mr
prosser
and
the
manager
started
simultaneously
dorman
said
you
would
be
said
owen
you
remember
mr
prosser
looked
keenly
at
him
i
seen
you
before
he
said
the
young
scallywag
at
the
farm
right
said
owen
been
wanting
to
meet
you
again
i
thought
the
whole
thing
over
and
it
struck
me
said
mr
prosser
handsomely
i
may
have
seemed
a
little
abrupt
at
our
last
meeting
no
fact
is
i
was
in
the
middle
of
an
infernally
difficult
passage
of
my
book
that
morning
and
when
you
began
was
my
fault
entirely
i
quite
understand
mr
prosser
produced
a
must
see
more
of
each
other
he
said
and
have
a
bit
of
dinner
some
night
come
tonight
very
sorry
i
have
to
go
to
the
theatre
tonight
come
and
have
a
bit
of
supper
afterwards
excellent
meet
me
at
the
savoy
at
i
glad
i
did
hit
you
with
that
loaf
abruptness
has
been
my
failing
through
life
my
father
was
just
the
same
at
the
savoy
then
the
manager
who
had
been
listening
with
some
restlessness
to
the
conversation
now
intervened
he
was
a
man
with
a
sense
of
fitness
of
things
and
he
objected
to
having
his
private
room
made
the
scene
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
reunion
of
old
college
chums
he
hinted
as
much
prrumph
he
observed
disapprovingly
mr
bentley
that
is
all
you
may
return
to
your
work
kindly
be
more
careful
another
time
in
stamping
the
letters
by
jove
said
mr
prosser
suddenly
reminded
of
his
wrongs
right
exercise
a
little
ordinary
care
you
young
son
of
a
gun
do
you
think
miss
delane
is
of
twopences
keep
an
eye
on
him
he
urged
the
manager
young
fellows
nowadays
want
someone
standing
over
them
with
a
knout
all
the
time
be
more
careful
another
time
young
man
remember
make
a
note
of
it
or
you
go
forgetting
the
seat
audrey
had
bought
for
him
at
the
piccadilly
theatre
proved
to
be
in
the
centre
of
the
sixth
row
of
stalls
practically
a
whatever
his
sufferings
might
be
escape
was
impossible
he
was
securely
wedged
in
the
cheaper
parts
of
the
house
were
sparsely
occupied
but
the
stalls
were
full
owen
disapproving
of
the
whole
business
refused
to
buy
a
programme
and
settled
himself
in
his
seat
prepared
for
the
worst
he
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
novel
and
he
did
not
anticipate
any
keen
enjoyment
from
it
in
its
dramatized
form
he
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
member
of
that
large
public
for
which
miss
edith
butler
catered
the
sentimental
adventures
of
governesses
in
ducal
houses
the
heroine
of
was
a
governess
no
longer
contented
his
soul
there
is
always
a
curiously
atmosphere
about
a
play
founded
on
a
book
one
seems
to
have
seen
it
all
before
during
the
whole
of
the
first
act
owen
attributed
to
this
his
feeling
of
familiarity
with
what
was
going
on
on
the
stage
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
he
found
himself
anticipating
events
but
it
was
not
till
the
third
act
that
the
truth
sank
in
the
third
was
the
only
act
in
which
in
his
dramatization
he
had
taken
any
real
liberties
with
the
text
of
the
novel
but
in
this
act
he
had
introduced
a
character
who
did
not
appear
in
the
novel
a
creature
of
his
own
imagination
and
now
with
bulging
eyes
he
observed
this
creature
emerge
from
the
wings
and
heard
him
utter
lines
which
he
now
clearly
remembered
having
written
audrey
had
been
right
serpent
edith
butler
had
stolen
his
play
his
mind
during
the
remainder
of
the
play
was
active
by
the
time
the
final
curtain
fell
and
he
passed
out
into
the
open
air
he
had
perceived
some
of
the
difficulties
of
the
case
to
prove
oneself
the
author
of
an
original
play
is
hard
but
not
impossible
friends
to
whom
one
had
sketched
the
plot
may
come
forward
as
witnesses
one
may
have
preserved
rough
notes
but
a
dramatization
of
a
novel
is
another
matter
all
dramatizations
of
any
given
novel
must
necessarily
be
very
much
alike
he
started
to
walk
along
piccadilly
and
had
reached
hyde
park
corner
before
he
recollected
that
he
had
an
engagement
to
take
supper
with
mr
prosser
at
the
savoy
hotel
he
hailed
a
cab
late
boomed
the
author
of
sociological
treatises
as
he
appeared
infernally
late
i
suppose
in
your
way
you
forgot
all
about
it
come
along
we
just
have
time
for
an
olive
and
a
glass
of
something
before
they
turn
the
lights
out
owen
was
still
thinking
deeply
as
he
began
his
supper
surely
there
was
some
way
by
which
he
could
prove
his
claims
what
had
he
done
with
the
original
manuscript
he
remembered
now
he
had
burnt
it
it
had
seemed
mere
useless
litter
then
probably
he
felt
bitterly
the
woman
butler
had
counted
on
this
mr
prosser
concluded
an
animated
conversation
with
a
waiter
on
the
subject
of
the
wines
of
france
leaned
forward
and
having
helped
himself
briskly
to
anchovies
began
to
talk
he
talked
loudly
and
rapidly
owen
his
thoughts
far
away
hardly
listened
presently
the
waiter
returned
with
the
selected
brand
he
filled
glass
and
owen
drank
and
felt
better
finding
his
glass
magically
full
once
more
he
emptied
it
again
and
then
suddenly
he
found
himself
looking
across
the
table
at
his
host
and
feeling
a
sense
of
absolute
conviction
that
this
was
the
one
man
of
all
others
whom
he
would
have
selected
as
a
confidant
how
kindly
though
somewhat
misty
his
face
was
how
soothing
if
a
little
indistinct
his
voice
he
said
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
should
like
your
advice
what
would
you
do
in
a
case
like
this
i
go
to
a
theatre
to
see
a
play
and
what
do
i
find
he
paused
and
eyed
his
host
impressively
that
tune
they
playing
said
mr
prosser
hear
it
everywhere
one
of
these
viennese
things
i
suppose
owen
was
annoyed
he
began
to
doubt
whether
after
all
mr
virtues
as
a
confidant
were
not
more
apparent
than
real
find
by
jove
he
continued
i
wrote
the
thing
myself
not
a
patch
on
merry
said
mr
prosser
owen
thumped
the
table
tell
you
i
find
i
wrote
the
thing
myself
thing
play
i
telling
you
about
this
thing
he
found
that
he
had
at
last
got
his
host
ear
mr
prosser
seemed
genuinely
interested
do
you
mean
owen
plunged
on
with
his
story
he
started
from
its
dim
beginning
from
the
days
when
he
had
bought
the
novel
on
his
journey
from
bath
to
cheltenham
he
described
his
methods
of
work
his
registering
of
the
package
his
suspense
his
growing
resignation
he
sketched
the
progress
of
his
life
he
spoke
of
audrey
and
gave
a
crisp
of
mr
sheppherd
he
took
his
hearer
right
up
to
the
moment
when
the
truth
had
come
home
to
him
towards
the
end
of
his
narrative
the
lights
went
out
and
he
finished
his
story
in
the
hotel
courtyard
in
the
cool
air
he
felt
revived
the
outlines
of
mr
prosser
became
sharp
and
distinct
again
the
sociologist
listened
admirably
he
appeared
absorbed
and
did
not
interrupt
once
makes
you
so
certain
that
this
was
your
version
he
asked
as
they
passed
into
the
strand
owen
told
him
of
the
creature
of
his
imagination
in
act
iii
you
have
lost
your
manuscript
i
burnt
it
what
one
might
have
expected
you
to
do
said
mr
prosser
unkindly
man
i
begin
to
believe
that
there
may
be
something
in
this
you
have
got
a
ghost
of
a
proof
that
would
hold
water
in
a
court
of
law
of
course
but
still
i
inclined
to
believe
you
for
one
thing
you
have
the
intelligence
to
invent
such
a
story
owen
thanked
him
fact
if
you
can
answer
me
one
question
i
shall
be
satisfied
it
seemed
to
owen
that
mr
prosser
was
tending
to
get
a
little
above
himself
as
an
intelligent
listener
he
had
been
of
service
but
that
appeared
to
be
no
reason
why
he
should
constitute
himself
a
sort
of
judge
and
master
of
the
ceremonies
very
good
of
you
he
said
will
edith
butler
be
satisfied
that
more
to
the
point
edith
butler
said
mr
prosser
owen
stopped
need
not
babble
it
from
the
you
are
the
only
person
besides
my
agent
who
knows
it
and
i
would
have
told
you
if
i
could
have
helped
it
it
is
a
thing
i
want
known
great
scott
man
goggle
at
me
like
a
fish
have
you
heard
of
pseudonyms
before
but
never
mind
take
it
from
me
that
i
edith
butler
now
listen
to
me
that
manuscript
reached
me
when
i
was
in
the
country
there
was
no
name
on
it
that
in
itself
points
strongly
to
the
fact
that
you
were
its
author
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
you
would
have
done
to
put
no
name
on
the
thing
enclosed
a
letter
anyhow
was
a
letter
enclosed
i
opened
the
parcel
out
of
doors
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
at
the
time
it
caught
the
letter
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
it
i
had
read
as
far
as
dear
madam
but
one
thing
i
do
remember
about
it
and
that
was
that
it
was
sent
from
some
hotel
in
cheltenham
and
i
could
remember
it
if
i
heard
it
now
then
can
tell
it
you
it
was
wilbraham
i
was
stopping
there
pass
said
mr
prosser
was
wilbraham
owen
heart
gave
a
jump
for
a
moment
he
walked
on
air
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
all
right
that
you
believe
do
said
mr
prosser
the
way
he
said
notice
of
went
up
last
night
owen
heart
turned
to
lead
but
he
stammered
tonight
the
house
was
packed
was
packed
with
paper
all
the
merry
in
london
were
there
it
has
been
the
worst
failure
this
season
and
by
george
he
cried
with
sudden
vehemence
right
if
i
told
them
once
it
would
fail
in
england
i
told
them
a
hundred
times
the
london
public
wo
stand
that
sort
of
blithering
twaddle
owen
stopped
and
looked
round
a
cab
was
standing
across
the
road
he
signalled
to
it
he
felt
incapable
of
walking
home
no
physical
blow
could
have
unmanned
him
more
completely
than
this
hideous
disappointment
just
when
by
a
miracle
everything
seemed
to
be
running
his
way
ride
than
walk
said
mr
prosser
pushing
his
head
through
the
open
window
slackness
that
the
curse
of
the
modern
young
man
where
shall
i
tell
him
to
drive
to
owen
mentioned
his
address
it
struck
him
that
he
had
not
thanked
his
host
for
his
hospitality
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
give
me
supper
mr
prosser
he
said
enjoyed
it
tremendously
again
said
mr
prosser
afraid
you
disappointed
about
the
play
owen
forced
a
smile
no
that
all
right
he
said
ca
be
helped
mr
prosser
half
turned
then
thrust
his
head
through
the
window
again
knew
there
was
something
i
had
forgotten
to
say
he
said
ought
to
have
told
you
that
the
play
was
produced
in
america
before
it
came
to
london
it
ran
two
seasons
in
new
york
and
one
in
chicago
and
there
are
three
companies
playing
it
still
on
the
road
here
my
card
come
round
and
see
me
tomorrow
i
ca
tell
you
the
actual
figures
but
you
be
all
right
you
have
pots
o
money
out
of
school
mark
you
i
am
not
defending
james
datchett
i
hold
no
brief
for
james
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
he
should
not
have
done
it
i
merely
say
that
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
just
that
ext
circ
nothing
more
let
us
review
the
matter
calmly
and
judicially
not
condemning
james
but
rather
probing
the
whole
affair
to
its
core
to
see
if
we
can
confirm
my
view
that
it
is
possible
to
find
excuses
for
him
we
will
begin
at
the
time
when
the
subject
of
the
colonies
first
showed
a
tendency
to
creep
menacingly
into
the
daily
of
his
uncle
frederick
james
uncle
frederick
was
always
talking
more
or
less
about
the
colonies
having
made
a
substantial
fortune
out
in
western
australia
but
it
was
only
when
james
came
down
from
oxford
that
the
thing
became
really
menacing
up
to
that
time
the
uncle
had
merely
spoken
of
the
colonies
colonies
now
he
began
to
speak
of
them
with
sinister
reference
to
his
nephew
he
starred
james
it
became
a
case
of
knott
presents
james
datchett
in
the
colonies
and
there
seemed
every
prospect
that
the
production
would
be
an
early
one
for
if
there
was
one
section
of
the
public
which
mr
knott
disliked
more
than
another
it
was
young
men
who
ought
to
be
out
earning
their
livings
instead
of
idling
at
home
he
expressed
his
views
on
the
subject
with
some
eloquence
whenever
he
visited
his
sister
house
mrs
datchett
was
a
widow
and
since
her
husband
death
had
been
in
the
habit
of
accepting
every
utterance
of
her
brother
frederick
as
a
piece
of
genuine
wisdom
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
james
uncle
had
just
about
enough
brain
to
make
a
fly
crooked
and
no
more
he
had
made
his
money
through
keeping
sheep
and
any
fool
can
keep
sheep
however
he
had
this
reputation
for
wisdom
and
what
he
said
went
it
was
not
long
therefore
before
it
was
evident
that
the
ranks
of
the
were
about
to
lose
a
member
james
for
his
part
was
all
against
the
colonies
as
a
setting
for
his
career
that
is
to
say
he
was
no
little
englander
he
had
no
earthly
objection
to
great
britain
by
all
means
have
colonies
they
could
rely
on
him
for
moral
support
but
when
it
came
to
legging
it
out
to
west
australia
to
act
as
a
sort
of
valet
to
uncle
frederick
beastly
sheep
no
not
for
james
for
him
the
literary
life
yes
that
was
james
dream
to
have
a
stab
at
the
literary
life
at
oxford
he
had
contributed
to
the
and
since
coming
down
had
been
endeavouring
to
do
the
same
to
the
papers
of
the
metropolis
he
had
had
no
success
so
far
but
some
inward
voice
seemed
to
tell
him
read
on
read
on
this
is
no
story
about
the
young
struggles
in
london
we
do
not
get
within
fifty
miles
of
fleet
street
a
temporary
compromise
was
effected
between
the
two
parties
by
the
securing
for
james
of
a
post
as
at
harrow
house
the
private
school
of
one
blatherwick
the
understanding
being
that
if
he
could
hold
the
job
he
could
remain
in
england
and
write
if
it
pleased
him
in
his
spare
time
but
if
he
fell
short
in
any
way
as
a
handler
of
small
boys
he
was
to
descend
a
step
in
the
animal
kingdom
and
be
matched
against
the
west
australian
sheep
there
was
to
be
no
second
chance
in
the
event
of
failure
from
the
way
uncle
frederick
talked
james
almost
got
the
idea
that
he
attached
a
spiritual
importance
to
a
connexion
with
sheep
he
seemed
to
strive
with
a
sort
of
religious
frenzy
to
convert
james
to
west
australia
so
james
went
to
harrow
house
with
much
the
same
emotions
that
the
old
guard
must
have
felt
on
their
way
up
the
hill
at
waterloo
harrow
house
was
a
grim
mansion
on
the
outskirts
of
dover
it
is
better
of
course
to
be
on
the
outskirts
of
dover
than
actually
in
it
but
when
you
have
said
that
you
have
said
everything
impressions
of
that
portion
of
his
life
were
made
up
almost
entirely
of
chalk
chalk
in
the
chalk
all
over
the
chalk
in
the
milk
in
this
universe
of
chalk
he
taught
bored
boys
the
rudiments
of
latin
geography
and
arithmetic
and
in
the
evenings
after
a
stately
cup
of
coffee
with
mr
blatherwick
in
his
study
went
to
his
room
and
wrote
stories
the
life
had
the
advantage
of
offering
few
distractions
except
for
mr
blatherwick
and
a
weird
freak
who
came
up
from
dover
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
to
teach
french
he
saw
nobody
it
was
about
five
weeks
from
the
beginning
of
term
that
the
river
of
life
at
harrow
house
became
ruffled
for
the
new
i
want
you
to
follow
me
very
closely
here
as
far
as
the
excusing
of
james
conduct
is
concerned
it
is
now
or
never
if
i
fail
at
this
point
to
touch
you
i
have
shot
my
bolt
let
us
marshal
the
facts
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
perfectly
ripping
morning
moreover
he
had
received
at
breakfast
a
letter
from
the
editor
of
a
monthly
magazine
accepting
a
short
story
this
had
never
happened
to
him
before
he
was
and
just
as
he
rounded
the
angle
of
the
house
he
came
upon
violet
taking
the
air
like
himself
violet
was
one
of
the
housemaids
a
trim
energetic
little
person
with
round
blue
eyes
and
a
friendly
smile
she
smiled
at
james
now
james
halted
morning
sir
said
violet
from
my
list
of
contributory
causes
i
find
that
i
have
omitted
one
item
that
there
did
not
appear
to
be
anybody
else
about
james
looked
meditatively
at
violet
violet
looked
smilingly
at
james
the
morning
was
just
as
ripping
as
it
had
been
a
moment
before
james
was
still
and
the
editor
letter
had
not
ceased
to
crackle
in
his
consequently
james
stooped
and
in
a
purely
brotherly
way
kissed
violet
this
of
course
was
wrong
it
was
no
part
of
james
duties
as
at
harrow
house
to
wander
about
bestowing
brotherly
kisses
on
housemaids
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
great
harm
done
in
the
circles
in
which
violet
moved
the
kiss
was
equivalent
to
the
of
loftier
society
everybody
who
came
to
the
back
door
kissed
violet
the
carrier
did
so
did
the
grocer
the
baker
the
butcher
the
gardener
the
postman
the
policeman
and
the
fishmonger
they
were
men
of
widely
differing
views
on
most
points
on
religion
politics
and
the
prospects
of
the
entrants
for
the
three
race
their
opinions
clashed
but
in
one
respect
they
were
unanimous
whenever
they
came
to
the
back
door
of
harrow
house
they
all
kissed
violet
had
a
story
accepted
by
the
said
james
casually
you
sir
said
violet
a
pretty
good
magazine
i
shall
probably
do
a
great
deal
for
it
from
time
to
time
the
editor
seems
a
decent
chap
he
sir
sha
tie
myself
up
in
any
way
of
course
unless
i
get
very
good
terms
but
i
shall
certainly
let
him
see
a
good
lot
of
my
stuff
jolly
morning
is
it
he
strolled
on
and
violet
having
sniffed
the
air
for
a
few
more
minutes
with
her
nose
went
indoors
to
attend
to
her
work
five
minutes
later
james
back
in
the
atmosphere
of
chalk
was
writing
on
the
blackboard
certain
sentences
for
his
class
to
turn
into
latin
prose
a
somewhat
topical
note
ran
through
them
as
thus
uncle
of
balbus
wished
him
to
tend
sheep
in
the
colonies
said
that
england
was
good
enough
for
him
sent
a
story
versus
to
maecenas
who
replied
that
he
hoped
to
use
it
in
due
course
his
mind
floated
away
from
the
classroom
when
a
shrill
voice
brought
him
back
please
sir
what
does
due
course
mean
james
reflected
it
to
immediately
he
said
is
a
great
man
he
wrote
on
the
blackboard
two
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
office
of
an
important
magazine
and
there
was
a
look
of
relief
on
the
editor
face
for
james
had
practically
promised
to
do
a
series
of
twelve
short
stories
for
him
it
has
been
well
observed
that
when
a
writer
has
a
story
rejected
he
should
send
that
story
to
another
editor
but
that
when
he
has
one
accepted
he
should
send
another
story
to
that
editor
acting
on
this
excellent
plan
james
being
off
duty
for
an
hour
after
tea
smoked
a
pipe
in
his
bedroom
and
settled
down
to
work
on
a
second
effort
for
the
universal
he
was
getting
on
rather
well
when
his
flow
of
ideas
was
broken
by
a
knock
on
the
door
in
yelled
james
your
author
is
notoriously
irritable
the
was
adolf
adolf
was
one
of
that
numerous
band
of
swiss
and
german
youths
who
come
to
this
country
prepared
to
give
their
services
ridiculously
cheap
in
exchange
for
the
opportunity
of
learning
the
english
language
mr
blatherwick
held
the
view
that
for
a
private
school
a
male
opener
was
superior
to
a
female
arguing
that
the
parents
of
prospective
pupils
would
be
impressed
by
the
sight
of
a
man
in
livery
he
would
have
liked
something
a
bit
more
imposing
than
adolf
but
the
latter
was
the
showiest
thing
that
could
be
got
for
the
money
so
he
made
the
best
of
it
and
engaged
him
after
all
an
astigmatic
parent
seeing
adolf
in
a
dim
light
might
be
impressed
by
him
you
never
could
tell
said
james
glaring
vrom

the
bulk
of
adolf
perquisites
consisted
of
the
tips
he
received
for
going
to
the
general
store
down
the
road
for
tobacco
stamps
and
so
on

growled
james
turning
to
his
work
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
adolf
so
far
from
getting
out
came
in
and
shut
the
door
said
adolf
with
a
finger
on
his
lips

james

considered
purely
as
a
situation
his
present
position
was
not
ideal
he
had
to
work
hard
and
there
was
not
much
money
attached
to
the
job
but
it
was
what
the
situation
stood
for
that
counted
it
was
his
little
rock
of
safety
in
the
midst
of
a
surging
ocean
of
west
australian
sheep
once
let
him
lose
his
grip
on
it
and
there
was
no
chance
for
him
he
would
be

hoarsely

james
roused
himself
at
all
costs
he
must
placate
this
worm
mr
blatherwick
was
an
austere
man
he
would
not
overlook
such
a
crime
he
appealed
to
the
other
chivalry
about
violet
he
said

james
last
impression
of
the
departing
one
was
of
a
vast
and
greasy
grin
stretching
most
of
the
way
across
his
face
adolf
as
blackmailer
in
which
role
he
now
showed
himself
differed
in
some
respects
from
the
conventional
blackmailer
of
fiction
it
may
be
that
he
was
doubtful
as
to
how
much
james
would
stand
or
it
may
be
that
his
soul
as
a
general
rule
was
above
money
at
any
rate
in
actual
specie
he
took
very
little
from
his
victim
he
seemed
to
wish
to
be
sent
to
the
village
oftener
than
before
but
that
was
all
half
a
crown
a
week
would
have
covered
james
financial
loss
but
he
asserted
himself
in
another
way
in
his
most
moments
adolf
never
forgot
the
reason
which
had
brought
him
to
england
he
had
come
to
the
country
to
learn
the
language
and
he
meant
to
do
it
the
difficulty
which
had
always
handicapped
him
hitherto
namely
the
poverty
of
the
vocabularies
of
those
in
the
servants
quarters
was
now
removed
he
appointed
james
of
the
english
language
to
himself
and
saw
that
he
entered
upon
his
duties
at
once
the
first
time
that
he
accosted
james
in
the
passage
outside
the
classroom
and
desired
him
to
explain
certain
difficult
words
in
a
leading
article
of
yesterday
paper
james
was
pleased
adolf
he
thought
regarded
the
painful
episode
as
closed
he
had
accepted
the
as
the
full
price
of
silence
and
was
now
endeavouring
to
be
friendly
in
order
to
make
amends
this
conduct
gratified
james
he
felt
genially
disposed
toward
adolf
he
read
the
leading
article
and
proceeded
to
give
a
full
and
kindly
explanation
of
the
hard
words
he
took
trouble
over
it
he
went
into
the
derivations
of
the
words
he
touched
on
certain
rather
tricky
of
the
same
adolf
went
away
with
any
doubts
he
might
have
had
of
james
capabilities
as
a
teacher
of
english
definitely
scattered
he
felt
that
he
had
got
hold
of
the
right
man
there
was
a
shade
less
geniality
in
james
manner
when
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
following
morning
but
he
did
not
refuse
to
help
the
untutored
foreigner
the
lecture
was
less
exhaustive
than
that
of
the
previous
morning
but
we
must
suppose
that
it
satisfied
adolf
for
he
came
again
next
day
his
faith
in
his
teacher
undiminished
james
was
trying
to
write
a
story
he
turned
on
the
student
out
he
howled
take
that
beastly
paper
away
ca
you
see

you
think
i

james
looked
at
him
there
was
a
pause
two
minutes
later
the
english
lesson
was
in
full
swing
all
that
james
had
ever
heard
or
read
about
the
wonderful
devotion
to
study
of
the
modern
german
young
man
came
home
to
him
during
the
next
two
weeks
our
english
youth
fritters
away
its
time
in
idleness
and
the
german
concentrates
adolf
concentrated
like
a
porous
plaster
every
day
after
breakfast
just
when
the
success
of
james
literary
career
depended
on
absolute
seclusion
he
would
come
trotting
up
for
his
lesson
james
writing
practically
ceased
this
sort
of
thing
can
not
last
there
is
a
limit
and
adolf
reached
it
when
he
attempted
to
add
to
the
existing
curriculum
james
as
had
been
said
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
coffee
with
mr
blatherwick
in
his
study
after
seeing
the
boys
into
bed
it
was
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
keep
this
appointment
a
fortnight
after
his
first
interview
with
adolf
that
the
young
student
waylaid
him
with
the
evening
paper
something
should
have
warned
adolf
that
the
moment
was
not
well
chosen
to
begin
with
james
had
a
headache
the
result
of
a
hard
day
with
the
boys
then
that
morning
english
lesson
had
caused
him
to
forget
entirely
an
idea
which
had
promised
to
be
the
nucleus
of
an
excellent
plot
and
lastly
passing
through
the
hall
but
an
instant
before
he
had
met
violet
carrying
the
coffee
and
the
evening
post
to
the
study
and
she
had
given
him
two
long
envelopes
addressed
in
his
own
handwriting
he
was
brooding
over
these
preparatory
to
opening
them
at
the
very
moment
when
adolf
addressed
him
said
adolf
opening
the
paper
james
eyes
gleamed
ominously

continued
adolf
unseeing

it
was
at
this
point
that
james
kicked

adolf

stricken
chamois
iss
he
cried
with
these
long
envelopes
in
his
hand
james
cared
for
nothing
he
kicked
adolf
again
said
the
student
having
bounded
away
he
added
a
few
words
in
his
native
tongue
and
proceeded

he
shot
off
to
his
lair
james
turned
away
and
went
down
the
passage
to
restore
his
nervous
tissues
with
coffee
meanwhile
in
the
study
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
in
moody
reflection
mr
blatherwick
was
musing
sadly
on
the
hardships
of
the
schoolmaster
life
the
proprietor
of
harrow
house
was
a
long
grave
man
one
of
the
last
to
hold
out
against
the
crusade
he
had
expressionless
hazel
eyes
and
a
general
air
of
being
present
in
body
but
absent
in
spirit
mothers
who
visited
the
school
to
introduce
their
sons
put
his
vagueness
down
to
activity
of
mind
busy
brain
they
thought
never
at
rest
even
while
he
is
talking
to
us
some
abstruse
point
in
the
classics
is
occupying
his
mind
what
was
occupying
his
mind
at
the
present
moment
was
the
thoroughly
unsatisfactory
conduct
of
his
wife
brother
bertie
baxter
the
more
tensely
he
brooded
over
the
salient
points
in
the
of
his
wife
brother
bertie
baxter
the
deeper
did
the
iron
become
embedded
in
his
soul
bertie
was
one
of
nature
touchers
this
is
the
age
of
the
specialist
bertie
speciality
was
borrowing
money
he
was
a
man
of
almost
eerie
versatility
in
this
direction
time
could
not
wither
nor
custom
stale
his
infinite
variety
he
could
borrow
with
a
breezy
bluffness
which
made
the
thing
practically
a
and
anon
when
his
victim
had
steeled
himself
against
this
method
he
could
extract
another
note
from
his
little
hoard
with
the
delicacy
of
one
playing
spillikins
mr
blatherwick
had
been
a
to
him
for
years
as
a
rule
the
proprietor
of
harrow
house
unbelted
without
complaint
for
bertie
as
every
good
borrower
should
had
that
knack
of
making
his
victim
feel
during
the
actual
moment
of
paying
over
as
if
he
had
just
made
a
rather
good
investment
but
released
from
the
spell
of
his
personal
magnetism
mr
blatherwick
was
apt
to
brood
he
was
brooding
now
why
he
was
asking
himself
morosely
should
he
be
harassed
by
this
bertie
it
was
not
as
if
bertie
was
penniless
he
had
a
little
income
of
his
own
no
it
was
pure
lack
of
consideration
who
was
bertie
that
he
at
this
point
in
his
meditations
violet
entered
with
the
coffee
and
the
evening
post
mr
blatherwick
took
the
letters
there
were
two
of
them
and
one
he
saw
with
a
rush
of
indignation
was
in
the
handwriting
of
his
mr
blatherwick
blood
simmered
so
the
fellow
thought
he
could
borrow
by
post
did
he
not
even
trouble
to
pay
a
visit
eh
he
tore
the
letter
open
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
cheque
for
five
pounds
mr
blatherwick
was
astounded
that
a
letter
from
his
should
not
contain
a
request
for
money
was
surprising
that
it
should
contain
a
cheque
even
for
five
pounds
was
miraculous
he
opened
the
second
letter
it
was
short
but
full
of
the
finest
noblest
sentiments
to
wit
that
the
writer
charles
pickersgill
having
heard
the
school
so
highly
spoken
of
by
his
friend
mr
herbert
baxter
would
be
glad
if
mr
blatherwick
could
take
in
his
three
sons
aged
seven
nine
and
eleven
respectively
at
the
earliest
convenient
date
mr
blatherwick
first
feeling
was
one
of
remorse
that
even
in
thought
he
should
have
been
harsh
to
the
bertie
his
next
was
one
of
elation
violet
meanwhile
stood
patiently
before
him
with
the
coffee
mr
blatherwick
helped
himself
his
eye
fell
on
violet
violet
was
a
friendly
little
thing
she
saw
that
mr
blatherwick
had
had
good
news
and
as
the
bearer
of
the
letters
which
had
contained
it
she
felt
almost
responsible
she
smiled
kindly
up
at
mr
blatherwick
mr
blatherwick
dreamy
hazel
eye
rested
pensively
upon
her
the
major
portion
of
his
mind
was
far
away
in
the
future
dealing
with
visions
of
a
school
grown
to
colossal
proportions
and
patronized
by
millionaires
the
section
of
it
which
still
worked
in
the
present
was
just
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
understand
that
he
felt
kindly
and
even
almost
grateful
to
violet
unfortunately
it
was
too
small
to
make
him
see
how
wrong
it
was
to
kiss
her
in
a
vague
fatherly
way
across
the
coffee
tray
just
as
james
datchett
walked
into
the
room
james
paused
mr
blatherwick
coughed
violet
absolutely
unmoved
supplied
james
with
coffee
and
bustled
out
of
the
room
she
left
behind
her
a
somewhat
massive
silence
mr
blatherwick
coughed
again
looks
like
rain
said
james
carelessly
said
mr
blatherwick
like
rain
said
james
said
mr
blatherwick
a
pause
if
it
rains
said
james
said
mr
blatherwick
another
pause
datchett
said
mr
blatherwick
said
james
er
feel
that
perhaps
james
waited
attentively
you
sugar
thanks
said
james
shall
be
sorry
if
it
rains
said
mr
blatherwick
conversation
languished
james
laid
his
cup
down
have
some
writing
to
do
he
said
think
i
be
going
upstairs
now
just
so
said
mr
blatherwick
with
relief
so
an
excellent
idea
datchett
said
mr
blatherwick
next
day
after
breakfast
said
james
a
feeling
of
content
was
over
him
this
morning
the
sun
had
broken
through
the
clouds
one
of
the
long
envelopes
which
he
had
received
on
the
previous
night
had
turned
out
on
examination
to
contain
a
letter
from
the
editor
accepting
the
story
if
he
would
reconstruct
certain
passages
indicated
in
the
margin
have
ah
unfortunately
been
compelled
to
dismiss
adolf
said
mr
blatherwick
said
james
he
had
missed
adolf
shining
morning
face
after
you
had
left
me
last
night
he
came
to
my
study
with
a
malicious
er
fabrication
respecting
yourself
which
i
need
not
ah
particularize
james
looked
pained
awful
thing
it
is
this
nourishing
vipers
in
bosom
i
been
giving
adolf
english
lessons
nearly
every
day
lately
no
sense
of
gratitude
these
foreigners
he
said
sadly
i
was
compelled
proceeded
mr
blatherwick
in
fact
just
so
james
nodded
sympathetically
you
know
anything
about
west
australia
he
asked
changing
the
subject
a
fine
country
i
believe
i
had
thought
of
going
there
at
one
time
said
mr
blatherwick
i
given
up
the
idea
now
said
james
three
from
dunsterville
once
upon
a
time
there
was
erected
in
longacre
square
new
york
a
large
white
statue
labelled
city
the
figure
of
a
woman
in
grecian
robes
holding
aloft
a
shield
critical
citizens
objected
to
it
for
various
reasons
but
its
real
fault
was
that
its
symbolism
was
faulty
the
sculptor
should
have
represented
new
york
as
a
conjuror
in
evening
dress
smiling
blandly
as
he
changed
a
rabbit
into
a
bowl
of
goldfish
for
that
above
all
else
is
new
york
speciality
it
changes
between
may
when
she
stepped
off
the
train
and
may
when
she
received
eddy
moore
letter
containing
the
information
that
he
had
found
her
a
post
as
stenographer
in
the
office
of
joe
rendal
it
had
changed
mary
hill
quite
remarkably
mary
was
from
dunsterville
which
is
in
canada
emigrations
from
dunsterville
were
rare
it
is
a
somnolent
town
and
as
a
rule
young
men
born
there
follow
in
their
father
footsteps
working
on
the
paternal
farm
or
helping
in
the
paternal
store
occasionally
a
daring
spirit
will
break
away
but
seldom
farther
than
montreal
two
only
of
the
younger
generation
joe
rendal
and
eddy
moore
had
set
out
to
make
their
fortunes
in
new
york
and
both
despite
the
gloomy
prophecies
of
the
village
sages
had
prospered
mary
third
and
last
emigrant
did
not
aspire
to
such
heights
all
she
demanded
from
new
york
for
the
present
was
that
it
should
pay
her
a
living
wage
and
to
that
end
having
studied
by
stealth
typewriting
and
shorthand
she
had
taken
the
plunge
thrilling
with
excitement
and
the
romance
of
things
and
new
york
had
looked
at
her
raised
its
eyebrows
and
looked
away
again
if
every
city
has
a
voice
new
york
at
that
moment
had
said
this
had
damped
mary
she
saw
that
there
were
going
to
be
obstacles
for
one
thing
she
had
depended
so
greatly
on
eddy
moore
and
he
had
failed
her
three
years
before
at
a
church
festival
he
had
stated
specifically
that
he
would
die
for
her
perhaps
he
was
still
willing
to
do
that
she
had
not
inquired
but
at
any
rate
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
employing
her
as
a
secretary
he
had
been
very
nice
about
it
he
had
smiled
kindly
taken
her
address
and
said
he
would
do
what
he
could
and
had
then
hurried
off
to
meet
a
man
at
lunch
but
he
had
not
given
her
a
position
and
as
the
days
went
by
and
she
found
no
employment
and
her
little
stock
of
money
dwindled
and
no
word
came
from
eddy
new
york
got
to
work
and
changed
her
outlook
on
things
wonderfully
what
had
seemed
romantic
became
merely
frightening
what
had
been
exciting
gave
her
a
feeling
of
dazed
helplessness
but
it
was
not
until
eddy
letter
came
that
she
realized
the
completeness
of
the
change
on
may
she
would
have
thanked
eddy
politely
for
his
trouble
adding
however
that
she
would
really
prefer
not
to
meet
poor
joe
again
on
may
she
welcomed
him
as
something
the
fact
that
she
was
to
be
employed
outweighed
a
the
fact
that
her
employer
was
to
be
joe
it
was
not
that
she
disliked
joe
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
remembered
joe
a
silent
shambling
youth
all
hands
feet
and
shyness
who
had
spent
most
of
his
spare
time
twisting
his
fingers
and
staring
adoringly
at
her
from
afar
the
opinion
of
those
in
the
social
whirl
of
dunsterville
had
been
that
it
was
his
hopeless
passion
for
her
that
had
made
him
fly
to
new
york
it
would
be
embarrassing
meeting
him
again
it
would
require
tact
to
discourage
his
silent
worshipping
without
wounding
him
more
deeply
she
hated
hurting
people
but
even
at
the
cost
of
that
she
must
accept
the
post
to
refuse
meant
ignominious
retreat
to
dunsterville
and
from
that
her
pride
revolted
she
must
revisit
dunsterville
in
triumph
or
not
at
all
joe
rendal
office
was
in
the
heart
of
the
financial
district
situated
about
up
a
building
that
to
mary
reared
amidst
the
less
impressive
architecture
of
her
seemed
to
reach
nearly
to
the
sky
a
apparently
baffled
and
mortified
by
the
information
that
she
had
an
appointment
took
her
name
and
she
sat
down
filled
with
a
fine
mixed
assortment
of
emotions
to
wait
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
in
new
york
she
felt
almost
easy
in
her
mind
new
york
with
its
shoving
jostling
hurrying
crowds
a
giant
full
of
human
fowls
scurrying
to
and
fro
clucking
ever
on
the
for
some
desired
morsel
and
ever
ready
to
swoop
down
and
snatch
it
from
its
temporary
possessor
had
numbed
her
but
now
she
felt
a
slackening
of
the
strain
new
york
might
be
too
much
for
her
but
she
could
cope
with
joe
the
haughty
boy
returned
mr
rendal
was
disengaged
she
rose
and
went
into
an
inner
room
where
a
big
man
was
seated
at
a
desk
it
was
joe
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
but
it
was
not
the
joe
she
remembered
he
of
the
twisted
ringers
and
silent
stare
in
his
case
new
york
had
conjured
effectively
he
was
improved
in
every
respect
in
the
old
days
one
had
noticed
the
hands
and
feet
and
deduced
the
presence
of
joe
somewhere
in
the
background
now
they
were
merely
adjuncts
it
was
with
a
rush
of
indignation
that
mary
found
herself
bucolic
and
awkward
awkward
with
joe
it
was
an
outrage
his
manner
heightened
the
feeling
if
he
had
given
the
least
sign
of
embarrassment
she
might
have
softened
towards
him
he
showed
no
embarrassment
whatever
he
was
very
much
at
his
ease
he
was
cheerful
he
was
even
flippant
to
our
beautiful
little
city
he
said
mary
was
filled
with
a
helpless
anger
what
right
had
he
to
ignore
the
past
in
this
way
to
behave
as
if
her
presence
had
never
reduced
him
to
pulp
you
sit
down
he
went
on
splendid
seeing
you
again
mary
you
looking
very
well
how
long
have
you
been
in
new
york
eddy
tells
me
you
want
to
be
taken
on
as
a
secretary
as
it
happens
there
is
a
vacancy
for
just
that
in
this
office
a
big
wide
vacancy
left
by
a
lady
who
departed
yesterday
in
a
shower
of
burning
words
and
hairpins
she
said
she
would
never
return
and
between
ourselves
that
was
the
right
guess
would
you
mind
letting
me
see
what
you
can
do
will
you
take
this
letter
down
certainly
there
was
something
compelling
about
this
new
joe
mary
took
the
pencil
and
pad
which
he
offered
and
she
took
them
meekly
until
this
moment
she
had
always
been
astonished
by
the
reports
which
filtered
through
to
dunsterville
of
his
success
in
the
big
city
of
course
nobody
had
ever
doubted
his
perseverance
but
it
takes
something
more
than
perseverance
to
fight
new
york
fairly
and
squarely
and
win
and
joe
had
that
something
he
had
force
he
was
sure
of
himself
it
please
he
said
when
he
had
finished
dictating
all
right
you
do
for
a
moment
mary
was
on
the
point
of
refusing
a
mad
desire
gripped
her
to
assert
herself
to
make
plain
her
resentment
at
this
revolt
of
the
serf
then
she
thought
of
those
scuttling
clucking
crowds
and
her
heart
failed
her
you
she
said
in
a
small
voice
as
she
spoke
the
door
opened
well
well
said
joe
we
all
are
come
in
eddy
mary
has
just
been
showing
me
what
she
can
do
if
time
had
done
much
for
joe
it
had
done
more
for
his
eddy
moore
he
had
always
been
and
according
to
local
standards
presentable
tall
slim
with
dark
eyes
that
made
you
catch
your
breath
when
they
looked
into
yours
and
a
ready
flow
of
speech
he
had
been
dunsterville
prize
exhibit
and
here
he
was
with
all
his
excellence
heightened
and
accentuated
by
the
polish
of
the
city
he
had
filled
out
his
clothes
were
wonderful
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
had
just
that
same
musical
quality
you
and
joe
have
fixed
it
up
capital
shall
we
all
go
and
lunch
somewhere
an
appointment
said
joe
late
already
be
here
at
two
sharp
mary
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
the
effect
of
eddy
suavity
had
been
to
make
mary
forget
the
position
in
which
she
now
stood
to
joe
eddy
had
created
for
the
moment
quite
an
atmosphere
of
good
fellowship
she
hated
joe
for
shattering
this
and
reminding
her
that
she
was
his
employee
her
quick
flush
was
not
lost
on
eddy
old
joe
is
a
little
abrupt
sometimes
he
said
a
pig
said
mary
defiantly
you
must
mind
it
new
york
makes
men
like
that
has
made
you
not
to
me
at
any
rate
oh
eddy
she
cried
impulsively
frightened
i
wish
i
had
never
come
here
you
the
only
thing
in
this
whole
city
that
is
hateful
little
girl
he
said
mind
let
me
take
you
and
give
you
some
lunch
come
along
eddy
was
soothing
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
he
stayed
her
with
minced
chicken
and
comforted
her
with
soft
shelled
crab
his
voice
was
a
lullaby
lulling
her
nerves
to
rest
they
discussed
the
dear
old
days
a
carper
might
have
said
that
eddy
was
the
least
bit
vague
on
the
subject
of
the
dear
old
days
a
carper
might
have
pointed
out
that
the
discussion
of
the
dear
old
days
when
you
came
to
analyse
it
was
practically
a
monologue
on
mary
part
punctuated
with
musical
yes
from
her
companion
but
who
cares
what
carpers
think
mary
herself
had
no
fault
to
find
in
the
roar
of
new
york
dunsterville
had
suddenly
become
very
dear
to
her
and
she
found
in
eddy
a
sympathetic
soul
to
whom
she
could
open
her
heart
you
remember
the
old
school
eddy
and
how
you
and
i
used
to
walk
there
together
you
carrying
my
and
helping
me
over
the
fences
yes
we
gather
and
persimmons
yes
murmured
eddy
you
remember
the
prizes
the
teacher
gave
the
one
who
got
best
marks
in
the
spelling
class
and
the
treats
at
christmas
when
we
all
got
twelve
sticks
of
striped
peppermint
candy
and
drawing
the
water
out
of
the
well
in
that
old
wooden
bucket
in
the
winter
and
pouring
it
out
in
the
playground
and
skating
on
it
when
it
froze
and
was
it
cold
in
the
winter
too
do
you
remember
the
stove
in
the
how
we
used
to
crowd
round
it
stove
yes
said
eddy
dreamily
yes
the
stove
yes
yes
those
were
the
dear
old
days
mary
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
looked
across
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
eddy
she
said
do
know
how
nice
it
is
to
meet
someone
who
remembers
all
about
those
old
times
i
felt
a
hundred
million
miles
from
dunsterville
before
i
saw
you
and
i
was
homesick
but
now
all
different
little
mary
you
remember
he
glanced
at
his
watch
with
some
haste
two
he
said
think
we
should
be
going
mary
face
fell
to
that
pig
joe
i
hate
him
and
i
show
him
that
i
do
eddy
looked
almost
alarmed
i
should
do
that
he
said
do
think
i
should
do
that
it
only
his
manner
at
first
you
get
to
like
him
better
he
an
awfully
good
fellow
really
joe
and
if
you
er
quarrelled
with
him
you
might
find
it
hard
what
i
mean
is
it
not
so
easy
to
pick
up
jobs
in
new
york
i
should
like
to
think
of
you
mary
he
added
tenderly
for
a
job
tired
perhaps
hungry
mary
eyes
filled
with
tears
good
you
are
eddy
she
said
i
horrid
grumbling
when
i
ought
to
be
thanking
you
for
getting
me
the
place
i
be
nice
to
him
if
i
can
as
nice
as
i
can
right
do
try
and
we
shall
be
seeing
quite
a
lot
of
each
other
we
must
often
lunch
together
mary
the
office
not
without
some
trepidation
two
hours
ago
it
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
be
frightened
of
joe
but
eddy
had
brought
it
home
to
her
again
how
completely
she
was
dependent
on
her
former
serf
and
he
had
told
her
to
be
back
at
two
sharp
and
it
was
now
nearly
a
quarter
past
the
outer
office
was
empty
she
went
on
into
the
inner
room
she
had
speculated
as
she
went
on
joe
probable
attitude
she
had
pictured
him
as
annoyed
even
rude
what
she
was
not
prepared
for
was
to
find
him
on
all
fours
grunting
and
rooting
about
in
a
pile
of
papers
she
stopped
short
you
doing
she
gasped
ca
think
what
you
meant
he
said
must
be
some
mistake
i
not
even
a
passable
pig
i
could
deceive
a
novice
he
rose
and
dusted
his
knees
you
seemed
absolutely
certain
in
the
restaurant
just
now
did
you
notice
that
you
were
sitting
near
to
a
sort
of
jungle
of
potted
palms
i
was
lunching
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
the
forest
mary
drew
herself
up
and
fixed
him
with
an
eye
that
shone
with
rage
and
scorn
she
cried
guilty
he
said
cheerfully
had
a
notion
that
you
were
there
till
you
shouted
that
pig
joe
i
hate
him
and
almost
directly
afterwards
i
left
did
not
shout
dear
girl
you
cracked
a
at
my
table
the
man
i
was
lunching
with
jumped
clean
out
of
his
seat
and
swallowed
his
cigar
you
ought
to
be
more
careful
mary
bit
her
lip
now
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
dismiss
me
you
not
much
the
thing
has
simply
confirmed
my
high
opinion
of
your
qualifications
the
ideal
secretary
must
have
two
qualities
she
must
be
able
to
sec
and
she
must
think
her
employer
a
pig
you
fill
the
bill
would
you
mind
taking
down
this
letter
life
was
very
swift
and
stimulating
for
mary
during
the
early
days
of
her
professional
career
the
inner
workings
of
a
busy
broker
office
are
always
interesting
to
the
stranger
she
had
never
understood
how
business
men
made
their
money
and
she
did
not
understand
now
but
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
see
that
if
they
were
all
like
joe
rendal
they
earned
it
there
were
days
of
comparative
calm
there
were
days
that
were
busy
and
there
were
days
that
packed
into
the
space
of
a
few
hours
the
concentrated
essence
of
a
sketch
an
earthquake
a
football
scrummage
and
the
on
the
tube
when
the
office
was
full
of
shouting
men
when
strange
figures
dived
in
and
out
and
banged
doors
like
characters
in
an
old
farce
and
harold
the
proud
lost
his
air
of
being
on
the
point
of
lunching
with
a
duke
at
the
club
and
perspired
like
one
of
the
proletariat
on
these
occasions
you
could
not
help
admiring
joe
even
if
you
hated
him
when
a
man
is
doing
his
own
job
well
it
is
impossible
not
to
admire
him
and
joe
did
his
job
well
superlatively
well
he
was
everywhere
where
others
trotted
he
sprang
where
others
raised
their
voices
he
yelled
where
others
were
in
two
places
at
once
he
was
in
three
and
moving
towards
a
fourth
these
upheavals
had
the
effect
on
mary
of
making
her
feel
curiously
linked
to
the
firm
on
ordinary
days
work
was
work
but
on
these
occasions
of
storm
and
stress
it
was
a
fight
and
she
looked
on
every
member
of
the
little
band
grouped
under
the
banner
of
rendal
as
a
for
joe
while
the
battle
raged
she
would
have
done
anything
her
resentment
at
being
under
his
orders
vanished
completely
he
was
her
captain
and
she
a
mere
unit
in
the
firing
line
it
was
a
privilege
to
do
what
she
was
told
and
if
the
order
came
sharp
and
abrupt
that
only
meant
that
the
fighting
was
fierce
and
that
she
was
all
the
more
fortunate
in
being
in
a
position
to
be
of
service
the
reaction
would
come
with
the
end
of
the
fight
her
private
hostilities
began
when
the
firm
ceased
she
became
an
ordinary
individual
again
and
so
did
joe
and
to
joe
as
an
ordinary
individual
she
objected
there
was
an
indefinable
something
in
his
manner
which
jarred
on
her
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
principally
his
insufferable
if
only
he
would
lose
his
temper
with
her
now
and
then
she
felt
he
would
be
bearable
he
lost
it
with
others
why
not
with
her
because
she
told
herself
bitterly
he
wanted
to
show
her
that
she
mattered
so
little
to
him
that
it
was
not
worth
while
quarrelling
with
her
because
he
wanted
to
put
her
in
the
wrong
to
be
superior
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
hate
a
man
who
treated
her
in
that
way
she
compared
him
to
his
disadvantage
with
eddy
eddy
during
these
days
continued
to
be
more
and
more
of
a
comfort
it
rather
surprised
her
that
he
found
so
much
time
to
devote
to
her
when
she
had
first
called
on
him
on
her
arrival
in
the
city
he
had
given
her
the
impression
more
she
admitted
by
his
manner
than
his
words
that
she
was
not
wanted
he
had
shown
no
disposition
to
seek
her
company
but
now
he
seemed
always
to
be
on
hand
to
take
her
out
to
lunch
appeared
to
be
his
chief
hobby
one
afternoon
joe
commented
on
it
with
that
air
of
suppressing
an
indulgent
smile
which
mary
found
so
trying
saw
you
and
eddy
at
stephano
just
now
he
said
between
sentences
of
a
letter
which
he
was
dictating
seeing
a
great
deal
of
eddy
are
you
said
mary
very
kind
he
knows
i
lonely
she
paused
has
forgotten
the
old
days
she
said
defiantly
joe
nodded
old
eddy
he
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
words
to
make
mary
fire
up
but
much
in
the
way
they
were
spoken
and
she
fired
up
accordingly
do
you
mean
she
cried
queried
joe
hinting
at
something
if
you
have
anything
to
say
against
eddy
why
do
you
say
it
straight
out
a
good
working
rule
in
life
never
to
say
anything
straight
out
speaking
in
parables
i
will
observe
that
if
america
was
a
monarchy
instead
of
a
republic
and
people
here
had
titles
eddy
would
be
a
certainty
for
first
earl
of
pearl
street
dignity
fought
with
curiosity
in
mary
for
a
moment
the
latter
won
do
know
what
you
mean
why
pearl
street
and
have
a
look
at
it
dignity
recovered
its
ground
mary
tossed
her
head
are
wasting
a
great
deal
of
time
she
said
coldly
i
take
down
the
rest
of
this
letter
idea
said
joe
indulgently
a
policeman
brooding
on
life
in
the
neighbourhood
of
city
hall
park
and
broadway
that
evening
awoke
with
a
start
from
his
meditations
to
find
himself
being
addressed
by
a
young
lady
the
young
lady
had
large
grey
eyes
and
a
slim
figure
she
appealed
to
the
aesthetic
taste
of
the
policeman
to
me
lady
he
said
with
gallant
alacrity
see
yez
acrost
you
i
do
want
to
cross
she
said
the
policeman
rather
liked
being
called
he
beamed
do
you
know
a
street
called
pearl
street
do
that
she
hesitated
sort
of
street
is
it
the
policeman
searched
in
his
mind
for
a
neat
definition
crooked
miss
he
said
he
then
proceeded
to
point
the
way
but
the
lady
had
gone
it
was
a
bomb
in
a
blue
dress
that
joe
found
waiting
for
him
at
the
office
next
morning
he
surveyed
it
in
silence
then
raised
his
hands
over
his
head
shoot
he
said
the
matter
right
had
you
to
say
that
about
eddy
you
know
what
i
mean
about
pearl
street
joe
laughed
you
take
a
look
at
pearl
street
mary
anger
blazed
out
did
think
you
could
be
so
mean
and
cowardly
she
cried
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
talk
about
people
behind
their
backs
when
when
besides
if
he
what
you
say
how
did
it
happen
that
you
engaged
me
on
his
recommendation
he
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
without
replying
have
engaged
you
he
said
the
recommendation
of
a
syndicate
of
forgers
and
men
he
stood
fingering
a
pile
of
papers
on
the
desk
is
the
only
person
who
remembers
the
old
days
mary
he
said
slowly
she
looked
at
him
surprised
there
was
a
note
in
his
voice
that
she
had
not
heard
before
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
embarrassment
and
a
subtler
feeling
which
she
could
not
analyse
but
before
she
could
speak
harold
the
entered
the
room
with
a
card
and
the
conversation
was
swept
away
on
a
tidal
wave
of
work
joe
made
no
attempt
to
resume
it
that
morning
happened
to
be
one
of
the
earthquake
mornings
and
conversation
what
there
was
of
it
consisted
of
brief
strenuous
remarks
of
a
purely
business
nature
but
at
intervals
during
the
day
mary
found
herself
returning
to
his
words
their
effect
on
her
mind
puzzled
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
somehow
they
caused
things
to
alter
their
perspective
in
some
way
joe
had
become
more
human
she
still
refused
to
believe
that
eddy
was
not
all
that
was
chivalrous
and
noble
but
her
anger
against
joe
for
his
insinuations
had
given
way
to
a
feeling
of
regret
that
he
should
have
made
them
she
ceased
to
look
on
him
as
something
wantonly
malevolent
a
thersites
recklessly
slandering
his
betters
she
felt
that
there
must
have
been
a
misunderstanding
somewhere
and
was
sorry
for
it
thinking
it
over
she
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
for
her
to
remove
this
misunderstanding
the
days
which
followed
strengthened
the
decision
for
the
improvement
in
joe
was
steadily
maintained
the
indefinable
something
in
his
manner
which
had
so
irritated
her
had
vanished
it
had
been
when
it
had
existed
so
nebulous
that
words
were
not
needed
to
eliminate
it
indeed
even
now
she
could
not
say
exactly
in
what
it
had
consisted
she
only
knew
that
the
atmosphere
had
changed
without
a
word
spoken
on
either
side
it
seemed
that
peace
had
been
established
between
them
and
it
amazed
her
what
a
difference
it
made
she
was
soothed
and
happy
and
kindly
disposed
to
all
men
and
every
day
felt
more
strongly
the
necessity
of
convincing
joe
and
eddy
of
each
other
merits
or
rather
of
convincing
joe
for
eddy
she
admitted
always
spoke
most
generously
of
the
other
for
a
week
eddy
did
not
appear
at
the
office
on
the
eighth
day
however
he
rang
her
up
on
the
telephone
and
invited
her
to
lunch
later
in
the
morning
joe
happened
to
ask
her
out
to
lunch
so
sorry
said
mary
just
promised
eddy
he
wants
me
to
meet
him
at
stephano
but
she
hesitated
should
we
all
lunch
together
she
went
on
impulsively
she
hurried
on
this
was
her
opening
but
she
felt
nervous
the
subject
of
eddy
had
not
come
up
between
them
since
that
memorable
conversation
a
week
before
and
she
was
uncertain
of
her
ground
wish
you
liked
eddy
joe
she
said
very
fond
of
you
and
it
seems
such
a
shame
that
i
mean
we
all
from
the
same
old
town
and
oh
i
know
i
put
it
badly
but
think
you
put
it
very
well
said
joe
if
i
could
like
a
man
to
order
i
do
it
to
oblige
you
but
well
i
not
going
to
keep
harping
on
it
perhaps
you
see
through
eddy
yourself
one
of
these
days
a
sense
of
the
hopelessness
of
her
task
oppressed
mary
she
put
on
her
hat
without
replying
and
turned
to
go
at
the
door
some
impulse
caused
her
to
glance
back
and
as
she
did
so
she
met
his
eye
and
stood
staring
he
was
looking
at
her
as
she
had
so
often
seen
him
look
three
years
before
in
dunsterville
humbly
appealingly
hungrily
he
took
a
step
forward
a
sort
of
panic
seized
her
her
fingers
were
on
the
she
turned
it
and
the
next
moment
was
outside
she
walked
slowly
down
the
street
she
felt
shaken
she
had
believed
so
thoroughly
that
his
love
for
her
had
vanished
with
his
shyness
and
awkwardness
in
the
struggle
for
success
in
new
york
his
words
his
manner
everything
had
pointed
to
that
and
now
it
was
as
if
those
three
years
had
not
been
nothing
had
altered
unless
it
were
herself
had
she
altered
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
this
thing
had
affected
her
like
some
physical
shock
the
crowds
and
noises
of
the
street
bewildered
her
if
only
she
could
get
away
from
them
and
think
quietly
and
then
she
heard
her
name
spoken
and
looked
round
to
see
eddy
you
could
come
he
said
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it
be
quiet
at
stephano
she
noticed
almost
unconsciously
that
he
seemed
nervous
he
was
unwontedly
silent
she
was
glad
of
it
it
helped
her
to
think
he
gave
the
waiter
an
order
and
became
silent
again
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
cloth
he
hardly
spoke
till
the
meal
was
over
and
the
coffee
was
on
the
table
then
he
leant
forward
he
said
always
been
pretty
good
friends
have
we
his
dark
eyes
were
looking
into
hers
there
was
an
expression
in
them
that
was
strange
to
her
he
smiled
but
it
seemed
to
mary
that
there
was
effort
behind
the
smile
course
we
have
eddy
she
said
he
touched
her
hand
little
mary
he
said
softly
he
paused
for
a
moment
he
went
on
would
like
to
do
me
a
good
turn
you
would
would
you
mary
eddy
of
course
he
touched
her
hand
again
this
time
somehow
the
action
grated
on
her
before
it
had
seemed
impulsive
a
mere
spontaneous
evidence
of
friendship
now
there
was
a
suggestion
of
artificiality
of
calculation
she
drew
back
a
little
in
her
chair
deep
down
in
her
some
watchful
instinct
had
sounded
an
alarm
she
was
on
guard
he
drew
in
a
quick
breath
nothing
much
nothing
at
all
it
only
this
i
i
joe
will
be
writing
a
letter
to
a
man
called
weston
on
thursday
thursday
remember
there
wo
be
anything
in
it
nothing
of
importance
nothing
private
but
i
i
want
you
to
mail
me
a
copy
of
it
mary
a
a
copy
of
she
was
looking
at
him
her
face
was
white
and
shocked
goodness
sake
he
said
irritably
look
like
that
not
asking
you
to
commit
murder
what
the
matter
with
you
look
here
mary
you
admit
you
owe

the
only
man
in
new
york
that

anything
for

i
get
you
your
job
well
then
it
not
as
if
i
were
asking
you
to
do
anything
dangerous
or
difficult
or
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
he
went
on
rapidly
he
did
not
look
at
her
his
eyes
wandered
past
her
shifting
restlessly
here
he
said
be
square
with
you
you
in
new
york
to
make
money
well
you
are
going
to
make
it
hammering
a
typewriter
i
giving
you
your
chance
i
going
to
be
square
with
you
let
me
see
that
letter
and
his
voice
died
away
abruptly
the
expression
on
his
face
changed
he
smiled
and
this
time
the
effort
was
obvious
joe
he
said
mary
turned
joe
was
standing
at
her
side
he
looked
very
large
and
wholesome
and
restful
do
want
to
intrude
he
said
i
wanted
to
see
you
eddy
and
i
thought
i
should
catch
you

i
wrote
a
letter
to
jack
weston
yesterday
after
i

home
from
the
office
and
one
to
you
and
somehow
i
managed
to
post
them
in
the
wrong
envelopes
it
matter
much
because
they
both
said
the
same
thing
same
thing
i
told
you
i
should
be
writing
to
you

and
explain

why

your
hurry
eddy
eddy
had
risen
from
his
seat
due
back
at
the
office
he
said
hoarsely

mary
back
joe
seated
himself
in
the
vacant
chair
looking
tired
he
said
eddy
talk
too
much
he
did
joe
you
were
right
mary
joe
chuckled
tell
you
something
i
did
tell
eddy
it
was
entirely
through
carelessness
that
i
posted
those
letters
in
the
wrong
envelopes
in
fact
to
be
absolutely
frank
it
was
through
carelessness
at
all
there
an
old
gentleman
in
pittsburgh
by
the
name
of
john
longwood
who
occasionally
is
good
enough
to
inform
me
of
some
of
his
intended
doings
on
the
market
a
day
or
so
before
the
rest
of
the
world
knows
them
and
eddy
has
always
shown
a
strong
desire
to
get
early
information
too
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
your
predecessor
at
the
office
left
a
little
abruptly
there
was
a
reason
i
engaged
her
as
a
confidential
secretary
and
she
overdid
it
she
confided
in
eddy
from
the
look
on
your
face
as
i
came
in
i
gathered
that
he
had
just
been
proposing
that
you
should
perform
a
similar
act
of
christian
charity
had
he
mary
clenched
her
hands
this
awful
new
york
she
cried
was
never
like
that
in
dunsterville
does
not
offer
quite
the
same
scope
said
joe
york
changes
everything
mary
returned
has
changed
eddy
it
has
changed
you
he
bent
towards
her
and
lowered
his
voice
altogether
he
said
just
the
same
in
one
way
i
tried
to
pretend
i
had
altered
but
it
no
use
i
give
it
up
i
still
just
the
same
poor
fool
who
used
to
hang
round
staring
at
you
in
dunsterville
a
waiter
was
approaching
the
table
with
the
air
which
waiters
cultivate
of
just
happening
by
chance
to
be
going
in
that
direction
joe
leaned
farther
forward
speaking
quickly
for
whom
he
said
did
care
a
single
solitary
snap
of
your
fingers
mary
she
looked
up
at
him
the
waiter
hovered
poising
for
his
swoop
suddenly
she
smiled
york
has
changed
me
too
joe
she
said
he
cried
pill
sare
observed
the
waiter
joe
turned
what
he
exclaimed
i
hanged
eddy
gone
off
and
left
me
to
pay
for
his
lunch
that
man
a
wonder
when
it
comes
to
he
in
a
class
by
himself
he
paused
i
have
the
luck
he
said
the
tuppenny
millionaire
in
the
crowd
that
strolled
on
the
promenade
des
etrangers
enjoying
the
morning
sunshine
there
were
some
who
had
come
to
roville
for
their
health
others
who
wished
to
avoid
the
rigours
of
the
english
spring
and
many
more
who
liked
the
place
because
it
was
cheap
and
close
to
monte
carlo
none
of
these
motives
had
brought
george
albert
balmer
he
was
there
because
three
weeks
before
harold
flower
had
called
him
a
vegetable
what
is
it
that
makes
men
do
perilous
deeds
why
does
a
man
go
over
niagara
falls
in
a
barrel
not
for
his
health
half
an
hour
with
a
would
be
equally
beneficial
to
his
liver
no
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
does
it
to
prove
to
his
friends
and
relations
that
he
is
not
the
mild
person
they
have
always
thought
him
observe
the
acrobat
as
he
prepares
to
swing
from
the
roof
by
his
eyelids
his
gaze
sweeps
the
house
is
true
it
seems
to
say
not
a
it
was
so
with
george
balmer
in
london
at
the
present
moment
there
exist
some
thousands
of
respectable
mechanical
unenterprising
young
men
employed
at
modest
salaries
by
various
banks
corporations
stores
shops
and
business
firms
they
are
put
to
work
when
young
and
they
stay
put
they
are
mussels
each
has
his
special
place
on
the
rock
and
remains
glued
to
it
all
his
life
to
these
thousands
george
albert
balmer
belonged
he
differed
in
no
detail
from
the
rest
of
the
great
army
he
was
as
respectable
as
as
mechanical
and
as
unenterprising
his
life
was
bounded
east
west
north
and
south
by
the
planet
insurance
company
which
employed
him
and
that
there
were
other
ways
in
which
a
man
might
fulfil
himself
than
by
giving
daily
imitations
behind
a
counter
of
a
mechanical
figure
walking
in
its
sleep
had
never
seriously
crossed
his
mind
on
george
at
the
age
of
there
descended
out
of
a
dear
sky
a
legacy
of
a
thousand
pounds
physically
he
remained
unchanged
beneath
the
shock
no
trace
of
hauteur
crept
into
his
bearing
when
the
head
of
his
department
calling
his
attention
to
a
technical
flaw
in
his
work
of
the
previous
afternoon
addressed
him
as
you
young
he
did
not
point
out
that
this
was
no
way
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
of
property
you
would
have
said
that
the
sudden
smile
of
fortune
had
failed
to
unsettle
him
but
all
the
while
his
mind
knocked
head
over
heels
was
lying
in
a
limp
heap
wondering
what
had
struck
it
to
him
in
his
dazed
state
came
harold
flower
harold
messenger
to
the
planet
insurance
company
and
one
of
the
most
assiduous
in
london
had
listened
to
the
office
gossip
about
the
legacy
as
if
to
the
strains
of
some
grand
sweet
anthem
he
was
a
bibulous
individual
of
uncertain
age
who
in
the
intervals
of
creeping
about
his
duties
kept
an
eye
open
for
possible
additions
to
his
staff
of
creditors
most
of
the
clerks
at
the
planet
had
been
laid
under
contribution
by
him
in
their
time
for
harold
had
a
way
with
him
that
was
good
for
threepence
any
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
things
had
come
to
a
sorry
pass
if
he
could
not
extract
something
special
from
plutocrat
balmer
in
his
hour
of
rejoicing
throughout
the
day
he
shadowed
george
and
shortly
before
backed
him
into
a
corner
tapped
him
on
the
chest
and
requested
the
temporary
loan
of
a
sovereign
in
the
same
breath
he
told
him
that
he
was
a
gentleman
that
a
messenger
life
was
practically
that
of
a
blanky
slave
and
that
a
young
man
of
spirit
who
wished
to
add
to
his
already
large
fortune
would
have
a
bit
on
giant
gooseberry
for
the
city
and
suburban
he
then
paused
for
a
reply
now
all
through
the
day
george
had
been
assailed
by
a
steady
stream
of
determined
again
and
again
he
had
been
staked
out
as
an
claim
by
men
whom
it
would
have
been
impolitic
to
rebuff
he
was
tired
of
lending
and
in
a
mood
to
resent
unauthorized
demands
harold
flower
struck
him
as
particularly
unauthorized
he
said
so
it
took
some
little
time
to
convince
mr
flower
that
he
really
meant
it
but
realizing
at
last
the
grim
truth
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
spoke
he
said
you
ca
spare
it
ca
you
a
gentleman
comes
and
asks
you
with
tack
and
civility
for
a
loan
of
about
nothing
and
all
you
do
is
to
curse
and
swear
at
him
do
you
know
what
i
call
you
you
and
your
thousand
quid
a
tuppenny
millionaire
what
i
call
you
keep
your
blooming
money
that
all
i
ask
it
much
good
you
get
out
of
it
i
know
your
sort
you
never
have
any
pleasure
of
it
not
you
you
the
careful
sort
you
put
it
into
consols
will
and
draw
your
a
year
money
was
meant
for
your
kind
it
do
nothing
to
you
you
ai
got
the
go
in
you
to
appreciate
it
a
vegetable
all
you
are
a
blanky
little
vegetable
a
blanky
little
vegetable
i
seen
turnips
with
more
spirit
in
that
what
you
got
and
brussels
sprouts
yes
parsnips
it
is
difficult
to
walk
away
with
dignity
when
a
man
with
a
hoarse
voice
and
a
watery
eye
is
comparing
you
to
your
disadvantage
with
a
parsnip
and
george
did
not
come
anywhere
near
achieving
the
feat
but
he
extricated
himself
somehow
and
went
home
brooding
mr
flower
remarks
rankled
particularly
because
it
so
happened
that
consols
were
the
identical
investment
on
which
he
had
decided
his
uncle
robert
with
whom
he
lived
as
a
paying
guest
had
strongly
advocated
them
also
they
had
suggested
themselves
to
him
independently
but
harold
flower
words
gave
him
pause
they
made
him
think
for
two
weeks
and
some
days
he
thought
flushing
uncomfortably
whenever
he
met
that
watery
but
contemptuous
eye
and
then
came
the
day
of
his
annual
vacation
and
with
it
inspiration
he
sought
out
the
messenger
whom
till
now
he
had
carefully
avoided
flower
he
said
lord
am
taking
my
holiday
tomorrow
will
you
forward
my
letters
i
will
wire
you
the
address
i
have
not
settled
on
my
hotel
yet
i
am
popping
over
he
paused
am
popping
over
he
resumed
carelessly
monte
who
inquired
mr
flower
monte
monte
carlo
you
know
mr
flower
blinked
twice
rapidly
then
pulled
himself
together
i
think
he
said
and
that
settled
it
the
george
who
strolled
that
pleasant
morning
on
the
promenade
des
strangers
differed
both
externally
and
internally
from
the
george
who
had
fallen
out
with
harold
flower
in
the
offices
of
the
planet
insurance
company
for
a
day
after
his
arrival
he
had
clung
to
the
garb
of
england
on
the
second
he
had
discovered
that
this
was
unpleasantly
warm
and
worse
conspicuous
at
the
casino
municipale
that
evening
he
had
observed
a
man
wearing
an
arrangement
in
bright
yellow
velvet
without
attracting
attention
the
sight
had
impressed
him
next
morning
he
had
emerged
from
his
hotel
in
a
flannel
suit
so
light
that
it
had
been
unanimously
condemned
as
impossible
by
his
uncle
robert
his
aunt
louisa
his
cousins
percy
eva
and
geraldine
and
his
aunt
louisa
mother
and
at
a
shop
in
the
rue
lasalle
had
spent
twenty
francs
on
a
homburg
hat
and
roville
had
taken
it
without
blinking
internally
his
alteration
had
been
even
more
considerable
roville
was
not
monte
carlo
in
which
gay
spot
he
had
remained
only
long
enough
to
send
a
picture
to
harold
flower
before
retiring
down
the
coast
to
find
something
cheaper
but
it
had
been
a
revelation
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
seeing
colour
and
it
intoxicated
him
the
silky
blueness
of
the
sea
was
startling
the
pure
white
of
the
great
hotels
along
the
promenade
and
the
casino
municipale
fascinated
him
he
was
dazzled
at
the
casino
the
pillars
were
crimson
and
cream
the
tables
and
pink
seated
on
a
striped
chair
he
watched
a
of
which
from
start
to
finish
he
understood
but
one
word
to
wit
absorbed
in
the
doings
of
a
gentleman
in
blue
who
wrangled
in
rapid
french
with
a
gentleman
in
yellow
while
a
and
a
in
a
mauve
flannel
suit
looked
on
at
the
brawl
it
was
during
that
evening
that
there
flitted
across
his
mind
the
first
suspicion
he
had
ever
had
that
his
uncle
robert
mental
outlook
was
a
little
limited
and
now
as
he
paced
the
promenade
watching
the
stir
and
bustle
of
the
crowd
he
definitely
condemned
his
absent
relative
as
a
chump
if
the
brown
boots
which
he
had
polished
so
assiduously
in
his
bedroom
that
morning
with
the
inside
of
a
and
which
now
gleamed
for
the
first
time
on
his
feet
had
a
fault
it
was
that
they
were
a
shade
tight
to
promenade
with
the
gay
crowd
therefore
for
any
length
of
time
was
injudicious
and
george
warned
by
a
shooting
sensation
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
rest
sank
down
gracefully
on
a
seat
to
rise
at
once
on
discovering
that
between
him
and
it
was
something
oblong
with
sharp
corners
it
was
a
book
a
fat
new
novel
george
drew
it
out
and
inspected
it
there
was
a
name
inside
julia
waveney
george
from
boyhood
up
had
been
raised
in
that
school
of
thought
whose
watchword
is
are
keepings
and
having
ascertained
that
there
was
no
address
attached
to
the
name
he
was
on
the
point
i
regret
to
say
of
pouching
the
volume
which
already
he
looked
upon
as
his
own
when
a
figure
detached
itself
from
the
crowd
and
he
found
himself
gazing
into
a
pair
of
grey
and
to
his
startled
conscience
accusing
eyes
thank
you
i
was
afraid
it
was
lost
she
was
breathing
quickly
and
there
was
a
slight
flush
on
her
face
she
took
the
book
from
george
unresisting
hand
and
rewarded
him
with
a
smile
missed
it
and
i
could
think
where
i
could
have
left
it
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
been
sitting
here
thank
you
so
much
she
smiled
again
turned
and
walked
away
leaving
george
to
reckon
up
all
the
social
solecisms
he
had
contrived
to
commit
in
the
space
of
a
single
moment
he
had
remained
seated
he
reminded
himself
throughout
the
interview
one
he
had
not
raised
his
hat
that
fascinating
homburg
simply
made
to
be
raised
with
a
debonair
swish
under
such
conditions
two
call
it
three
because
he
ought
to
have
raised
it
twice
he
had
gaped
like
a
fool
four
and
five
he
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
of
acknowledgement
in
reply
to
her
thanks
five
vast
bloomers
in
under
a
minute
what
could
she
have
thought
of
him
the
sun
ceased
to
shine
what
sort
of
an
utter
outsider
could
she
have
considered
him
an
east
wind
sprang
up
what
kind
of
a
cockney
bounder
and
cad
could
she
have
taken
him
for
the
sea
turned
to
an
oily
grey
and
george
rising
strode
back
in
the
direction
of
his
hotel
in
a
mood
that
made
him
forget
that
he
had
brown
boots
on
at
all
his
mind
was
active
several
times
since
he
had
come
to
roville
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
sensation
which
he
could
not
understand
a
vague
yearning
sensation
a
feeling
that
splendid
as
everything
was
in
this
paradise
of
colour
there
was
nevertheless
something
lacking
now
he
understood
you
had
to
be
in
love
to
get
the
full
flavour
of
these
vivid
whites
and
blues
he
was
getting
it
now
his
mood
of
dejection
had
passed
swiftly
to
be
succeeded
by
an
exhilaration
such
as
he
had
only
felt
once
in
his
life
before
about
through
a
dinner
given
to
the
planet
staff
on
a
princely
scale
by
a
retiring
general
manager
he
was
exalted
nothing
seemed
impossible
to
him
he
would
meet
the
girl
again
on
the
promenade
he
told
himself
dashingly
renew
the
acquaintance
show
her
that
he
was
not
the
gaping
idiot
he
had
appeared
his
imagination
donned
its
boots
he
saw
himself
proposing
eloquently
accepted
married
living
happily
ever
after
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
excellent
first
move
would
be
to
find
out
where
she
was
staying
he
bought
a
paper
and
turned
to
the
list
of
visitors
miss
waveney
where
was
it
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
column
and
then
with
a
crash
down
came
his
in
hideous
ruin
cercle
de
la
mediterranee
lord
frederick
weston
the
countess
of
southborne
and
the
hon
adelaide
liss
lady
julia
waveney
he
dropped
the
paper
and
hobbled
on
to
his
hotel
his
boots
had
begun
to
hurt
him
again
for
he
no
longer
walked
on
air
at
roville
there
are
several
institutions
provided
by
the
municipality
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
visitors
temporarily
to
kill
thought
chief
among
these
is
the
casino
municipale
where
for
a
price
the
sorrowful
may
obtain
oblivion
by
means
of
the
ingenious
game
of
disappointed
lovers
at
roville
take
to
as
in
other
places
they
might
take
to
drink
it
is
a
fascinating
game
a
high
priest
flicks
a
red
ball
into
a
polished
oaken
bowl
at
the
bottom
of
which
are
holes
each
bearing
a
number
up
to
nine
the
ball
swings
round
and
round
like
a
planet
slows
down
stumbles
among
the
holes
rests
for
a
moment
in
the
one
which
you
have
backed
then
hops
into
the
next
one
and
you
lose
if
ever
there
was
a
pastime
calculated
to
place
young
adam
cupid
in
the
background
this
is
it
to
the
tables
that
night
fled
george
with
his
hopeless
passion
from
the
instant
when
he
read
the
fatal
words
in
the
paper
he
had
recognized
its
hopelessness
all
other
obstacles
he
had
been
prepared
to
overcome
but
a
title
no
he
had
no
illusions
as
to
his
place
in
the
social
scale
the
lady
julias
of
this
world
did
not
marry
insurance
clerks
even
if
their
late
mother
cousin
had
left
them
a
thousand
pounds
that
was
definitely
ended
it
was
a
thing
of
the
past
all
over
except
the
heartache
by
way
of
a
preliminary
sip
of
the
waters
of
lethe
before
beginning
the
full
draught
he
placed
a
franc
on
number
seven
and
lost
another
franc
on
six
suffered
the
same
fate
he
threw
a
recklessly
on
evens
it
won
it
was
enough
thrusting
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
wedging
himself
firmly
against
the
table
he
settled
down
to
make
a
night
of
it
there
is
nothing
like
for
absorbing
the
mind
it
was
some
time
before
george
became
aware
that
a
hand
was
prodding
him
in
the
ribs
he
turned
irritated
immediately
behind
him
filling
the
landscape
were
two
stout
frenchmen
but
even
as
he
searched
his
brain
for
words
that
would
convey
to
them
in
their
native
tongue
his
disapproval
of
this
jostling
he
perceived
that
they
though
stout
and
in
a
general
way
offensive
were
in
this
particular
respect
guiltless
the
prodding
hand
belonged
to
somebody
invisible
behind
them
it
was
small
and
gloved
a
woman
hand
it
held
a
piece
then
in
a
gap
caused
by
a
movement
in
the
crowd
he
saw
the
face
of
lady
julia
waveney
she
smiled
at
him
eight
please
would
you
mind
he
heard
her
say
and
then
the
crowd
shifted
again
and
she
disappeared
leaving
him
holding
the
coin
his
mind
in
a
whirl
the
game
of
demands
undivided
attention
from
its
devotees
to
play
with
a
mind
full
of
other
matters
is
a
mistake
this
mistake
george
made
hardly
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
flung
the
coin
on
the
board
she
had
asked
him
to
place
it
on
eight
and
he
thought
that
he
had
placed
it
on
eight
that
in
reality
blinded
by
emotion
he
had
placed
it
on
three
was
a
fact
which
came
home
to
him
neither
then
nor
later
consequently
when
the
ball
ceased
to
roll
and
a
sepulchral
voice
croaked
the
news
that
eight
was
the
winning
number
he
fixed
on
the
croupier
a
gaze
that
began
by
being
joyful
and
expectant
and
ended
the
croupier
remaining
entirely
unresponsive
by
being
wrathful
he
leaned
towards
him
he
said
jete
cinq
francs
sur
huit
the
croupier
was
a
man
with
a
pointed
moustache
and
an
air
of
having
seen
all
the
sorrow
and
wickedness
that
there
had
ever
been
in
the
world
he
twisted
the
former
and
permitted
a
faint
smile
to
deepen
the
melancholy
of
the
latter
but
he
did
not
speak
george
moved
to
his
side
the
two
stout
frenchmen
had
strolled
off
leaving
behind
them
he
tapped
the
croupier
on
the
shoulder
say
he
said
the
game
jete
cinq
francs
sur
huit
i
tell
you
a
forgotten
idiom
from
the
days
of
boyhood
and
french
exercises
came
to
him
qui
he
added
faites
vos
crooned
the
croupier
in
a
detached
manner
to
the
normal
george
as
to
most
englishmen
of
his
age
the
one
cardinal
rule
in
life
was
at
all
costs
to
avoid
rendering
himself
conspicuous
in
public
than
george
normal
no
violet
that
ever
hid
itself
in
a
mossy
bank
could
have
had
a
greater
distaste
for
scenes
but
tonight
he
was
not
normal
roville
and
its
colour
had
wrought
a
sort
of
fever
in
his
brain
had
increased
it
and
love
had
caused
it
to
rage
if
this
had
been
entirely
his
own
affair
it
is
probable
that
the
croupier
frigid
calm
would
have
quelled
him
and
he
would
have
retired
fermenting
but
baffled
but
it
was
not
his
own
affair
he
was
fighting
the
cause
of
the
only
girl
in
the
world
she
had
trusted
him
could
he
fail
her
no
he
was
dashed
if
he
could
he
would
show
her
what
he
was
made
of
his
heart
swelled
within
him
a
thrill
permeated
his
entire
being
starting
at
his
head
and
running
out
at
his
heels
he
felt
tremendous
a
sort
of
blend
of
oliver
cromwell
a
berserk
warrior
and
sir
galahad
he
said
again
what
about
it
this
time
the
croupier
did
speak
he
said
and
print
can
not
convey
the
pensive
scorn
of
his
voice
it
stung
george
in
his
exalted
mood
like
a
blow
finished
was
it
all
right
now
he
would
show
them
they
had
asked
for
it
and
now
they
should
get
it
how
much
did
it
come
to
five
francs
the
stake
had
been
and
you
got
seven
times
your
stake
and
you
got
your
stake
back
he
was
nearly
forgetting
that
forty
francs
in
all
then
two
of
those
gold
in
fact
very
well
then
he
leaned
forward
quickly
across
the
croupier
snatched
the
lid
off
the
gold
tray
and
removed
two
louis
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
life
that
the
scenes
which
we
have
rehearsed
in
our
minds
never
happen
as
we
have
pictured
them
happening
in
the
present
case
for
instance
it
had
been
george
intention
to
handle
the
subsequent
stages
of
this
little
dispute
with
an
easy
dignity
he
had
proposed
the
money
obtained
to
hand
it
over
to
its
rightful
owner
raise
his
hat
and
retire
with
an
air
a
gallant
champion
of
the
oppressed
it
was
probably
about
of
a
second
after
his
hand
had
closed
on
the
coins
that
he
realized
in
the
most
vivid
manner
that
these
were
not
the
lines
on
which
the
incident
was
to
develop
and
with
all
his
heart
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
discarded
those
brown
boots
in
favour
of
a
worn
but
roomy
pair
of
gent
oxfords
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
and
a
silence
of
utter
astonishment
while
the
minds
of
those
who
had
witnessed
the
affair
adjusted
themselves
to
the
marvel
and
then
the
world
became
full
of
starting
eyes
yelling
throats
and
clutching
hands
from
all
over
the
casino
fresh
units
swarmed
like
bees
to
swell
the
crowd
at
the
centre
of
things
promenaders
ceased
to
promenade
waiters
to
wait
elderly
gentlemen
sprang
on
to
tables
but
in
that
momentary
pause
george
had
got
off
the
mark
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
standing
was
the
one
nearest
to
the
door
and
he
had
been
on
the
door
side
of
it
as
the
first
eyes
began
to
start
the
first
throats
to
yell
and
the
first
hands
to
clutch
he
was
passing
the
counter
of
the
he
charged
the
at
full
speed
and
true
to
its
mission
it
swung
he
had
a
vague
glimpse
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
of
the
counter
and
then
he
was
in
the
square
with
the
cold
night
breeze
blowing
on
his
forehead
and
the
stars
winking
down
from
the
blue
sky
a
on
the
pavement
ever
the
man
of
business
stepped
forward
and
offered
him
the
paris
edition
of
the
and
being
in
the
direct
line
of
transit
shot
swiftly
into
the
road
and
fell
into
a
heap
while
george
shaken
but
going
well
turned
off
to
the
left
where
there
seemed
to
be
rather
more
darkness
than
anywhere
else
and
then
the
casino
disgorged
the
pursuers
to
george
looking
hastily
over
his
shoulder
there
seemed
a
thousand
of
them
the
square
rang
with
their
cries
he
could
not
understand
them
but
gathered
that
they
were
uncomplimentary
at
any
rate
they
stimulated
a
little
man
in
evening
dress
strolling
along
the
pavement
towards
him
to
become
suddenly
animated
and
to
leap
from
side
to
side
with
outstretched
arms
panic
makes
harlequin
of
us
all
for
one
who
had
never
played
rugby
football
george
handled
the
situation
well
he
drew
the
defence
with
a
feint
to
the
left
then
swerving
to
the
right
shot
past
into
the
friendly
darkness
from
behind
came
the
ringing
of
feet
and
an
evergrowing
din
it
is
one
of
the
few
compensations
a
fugitive
pursued
by
a
crowd
enjoys
that
while
he
has
space
for
his
manoeuvres
those
who
pursue
are
hampered
by
their
numbers
in
the
little
regiment
that
pounded
at
his
heels
it
is
probable
that
there
were
many
faster
runners
than
george
on
the
other
hand
there
were
many
slower
and
in
the
early
stages
of
the
chase
these
impeded
their
swifter
brethren
at
the
end
of
the
first
therefore
george
not
sparing
himself
had
drawn
well
ahead
and
for
the
first
time
found
leisure
for
connected
thought
his
brain
became
preternaturally
alert
so
that
when
rounding
a
corner
he
perceived
entering
the
main
road
from
a
in
front
of
him
a
small
knot
of
pedestrians
he
did
not
waver
but
was
seized
with
a
keen
spasm
of
presence
of
mind
without
pausing
in
his
stride
he
pointed
excitedly
before
him
and
at
the
same
moment
shouted
the
words
la
vite
vite
his
stock
of
french
was
small
but
it
ran
to
that
and
for
his
purpose
it
was
ample
the
french
temperament
is
not
stolid
when
the
french
temperament
sees
a
man
running
rapidly
and
pointing
into
the
middle
distance
and
hears
him
shouting
la
vite
vite
it
does
not
stop
to
make
formal
inquiries
it
sprints
like
a
mustang
it
did
so
now
with
the
happy
result
that
a
moment
later
george
was
racing
down
the
road
the
centre
and
recognized
leader
of
an
enthusiastic
band
of
six
which
in
the
next
twenty
yards
swelled
to
eleven
five
minutes
later
in
a
near
the
harbour
he
was
sipping
the
first
glass
of
a
bottle
of
cheap
but
comforting
while
he
explained
to
the
interested
proprietor
by
means
of
a
mixture
of
english
broken
french
and
gestures
that
he
had
been
helping
to
chase
a
thief
but
had
been
forced
by
fatigue
to
retire
prematurely
for
refreshment
the
proprietor
gathered
however
that
he
had
every
confidence
in
the
zeal
of
his
still
active
colleagues
it
is
convincing
evidence
of
the
extent
to
which
love
had
triumphed
over
prudence
in
george
soul
that
the
advisability
of
lying
hid
in
his
hotel
on
the
following
day
did
not
even
cross
his
mind
immediately
after
breakfast
or
what
passed
for
it
at
roville
he
set
out
for
the
hotel
cercle
de
la
mediterranee
to
hand
over
the
two
louis
to
their
owner
lady
julia
he
was
informed
on
arrival
was
out
the
porter
politely
genial
advised
monsieur
to
seek
her
on
the
promenade
des
etrangers
she
was
there
on
the
same
seat
where
she
had
left
the
book
morning
he
said
she
had
not
seen
him
coming
and
she
started
at
his
voice
the
flush
was
back
on
her
face
as
she
turned
to
him
there
was
a
look
of
astonishment
in
the
grey
eyes
he
held
out
the
two
louis
could
give
them
to
you
last
night
he
said
a
horrible
idea
seized
him
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
say
he
stammered
say
i
hope
you
do
think
i
had
run
off
with
your
winnings
for
good
the
croupier
would
give
them
up
you
know
so
i
had
to
grab
them
and
run
they
came
to
exactly
two
louis
you
put
on
five
francs
you
know
and
you
get
seven
times
your
stake
i
an
elderly
lady
seated
on
the
bench
who
had
loomed
from
behind
a
parasol
towards
the
middle
of
these
remarks
broke
abruptly
into
speech
is
this
young
man
george
looked
at
her
startled
he
had
hardly
been
aware
of
her
presence
till
now
rapidly
he
diagnosed
her
as
a
mother
or
aunt
she
looked
more
like
an
aunt
of
course
it
must
seem
odd
to
her
his
charging
in
like
this
a
perfect
stranger
and
beginning
to
chat
with
her
daughter
or
niece
or
whatever
it
was
he
began
to
justify
himself
met
your
this
young
lady
something
told
him
that
was
not
the
proper
way
to
put
it
but
hang
it
what
else
could
he
say
the
casino
last
night
he
stopped
the
effect
of
his
words
on
the
elderly
lady
was
remarkable
her
face
seemed
to
turn
to
stone
and
become
all
sharp
points
she
stared
at
the
girl
you
were
gambling
at
the
casino
last
night
she
said
she
rose
from
the
seat
a
frozen
statue
of
displeasure
shall
return
to
the
hotel
when
you
have
arranged
your
financial
transactions
with
your
friend
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
you
will
find
me
in
my
room
george
looked
after
her
dumbly
the
girl
spoke
in
a
curiously
strained
voice
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
herself
do
care
she
said
glad
george
was
concerned
afraid
your
mother
is
offended
lady
julia
there
was
a
puzzled
look
in
her
grey
eyes
as
they
met
his
then
they
lit
up
she
leaned
back
in
the
seat
and
began
to
laugh
softly
at
first
and
then
with
a
note
that
jarred
on
george
whatever
the
humour
of
the
situation
and
he
had
not
detected
it
at
present
this
mirth
he
felt
was
unnatural
and
excessive
she
checked
herself
at
length
and
a
flush
crept
over
her
face
do
know
why
i
did
that
she
said
abruptly
sorry
there
was
nothing
funny
in
what
you
said
but
i
not
lady
julia
and
i
have
no
mother
that
was
lady
julia
who
has
just
gone
and
i
am
nothing
more
important
than
her
companion
companion
had
better
say
her
late
companion
it
will
soon
be
that
i
had
strict
orders
you
see
not
to
go
near
the
casino
without
her
and
i
went
then
i
lost
you
your
job
i
mean
your
position
if
it
been
for
me
she
would
have
known
i
have
done
me
a
great
service
she
said
have
cut
the
painter
for
me
when
i
have
been
trying
for
months
to
muster
up
the
courage
to
cut
it
for
myself
i
do
suppose
you
know
what
it
is
to
get
into
a
groove
and
long
to
get
out
of
it
and
not
have
the
pluck
my
brother
has
been
writing
to
me
for
a
long
time
to
join
him
in
canada
and
i
the
courage
or
the
energy
or
whatever
it
is
that
takes
people
out
of
grooves
i
knew
i
was
wasting
my
life
but
i
was
fairly
happy
at
least
not
unhappy
so
well
there
it
was
i
suppose
women
are
like
that
now
now
you
have
jerked
me
out
of
the
groove
i
shall
go
out
to
bob
by
the
first
boat
he
scratched
the
concrete
thoughtfully
with
his
stick
a
hard
life
out
there
he
said
it
a
life
he
looked
at
the
strollers
on
the
promenade
they
seemed
very
far
away
in
another
world
here
he
said
hoarsely
and
stopped
i
sit
down
he
asked
abruptly
got
something
to
say
and
i
ca
say
it
when
i
looking
at
you
he
sat
down
and
fastened
his
gaze
on
a
yacht
that
swayed
at
anchor
against
the
cloudless
sky
here
he
said
you
marry
me
he
heard
her
turn
quickly
and
felt
her
eyes
upon
him
he
went
on
doggedly
know
he
said
only
met
yesterday
you
probably
think
i
mad
do
think
you
mad
she
said
quietly
only
think
you
too
quixotic
you
sorry
for
me
and
you
are
letting
a
kind
impulse
carry
you
away
as
you
did
last
night
at
the
casino
it
like
you
for
the
first
time
he
turned
towards
her
do
know
what
you
suppose
i
am

said
i

you
a
clerk
in
an
insurance
office

few
weeks
ago
that

now
you

out
of
it
or
not
will
you
pull
me
out
she
did
not
speak
she
sat
looking
out
to
sea
past
the
crowd
he
watched
her
face
but
her
hat
shaded
her
eyes
and
he
could
read
nothing
in
it
and
then
suddenly
without
quite
knowing
how
it
had
got
there
he
found
that
her
hand
was
in
his
and
he
was
clutching
it
as
a
drowning
man
clutches
a
rope
he
could
see
her
eyes
now
and
there
was
a
message
in
them
that
set
his
heart
racing
a
great
content
filled
him
she
was
so
companionable
such
a
friend
it
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
it
was
only
yesterday
that
they
had
met
for
the
first
time
now
she
said
you
mind
telling
me
your
name
the
little
waves
murmured
as
they
rolled
lazily
up
the
beach
somewhere
behind
the
trees
in
the
gardens
a
band
had
begun
to
play
the
breeze
blowing
in
from
the
blue
mediterranean
was
charged
with
salt
and
happiness
and
from
a
seat
on
the
promenade
a
young
man
swept
the
crowd
with
a
defiant
gaze
is
true
it
seemed
to
say
not
a
ahead
of
schedule
it
was
to
wilson
his
valet
with
whom
he
frequently
chatted
in
airy
fashion
before
rising
of
a
morning
that
rollo
finch
first
disclosed
his
great
idea
wilson
was
a
man
of
silent
habit
and
men
of
silent
habit
rarely
escaped
rollo
confidences
he
said
one
morning
from
the
recesses
of
his
bed
as
the
valet
entered
with
his
you
ever
been
in
love
sir
said
the
valet
unperturbed
one
would
hardly
have
expected
the
answer
to
be
in
the
affirmative
like
most
valets
and
all
chauffeurs
wilson
gave
the
impression
of
being
above
the
softer
emotions
happened
inquired
rollo
came
to
nothing
sir
said
wilson
beginning
to
strop
the
razor
with
no
appearance
of
concern
said
rollo
i
bet
i
know
why
you
did
go
the
right
way
to
work
sir
one
fellow
in
a
hundred
does
i
know
i
thought
it
out
been
thinking
the
deuce
of
a
lot
about
it
lately
it
dashed
tricky
this
making
love
most
fellows
have
a
notion
how
to
work
it
no
system
no
system
wilson
old
scout
sir
i
a
system
and
i
tell
it
you
it
may
do
you
a
bit
of
good
next
time
you
feel
that
impulse
you
not
dead
yet
now
my
system
is
simply
to
go
to
it
gradually
by
degrees
work
by
schedule
see
what
i
mean
entirely
sir
i
give
you
the
details
first
thing
you
want
to
find
the
girl
so
sir
when
you
found
her
what
do
you
do
you
just
look
at
her
see
what
i
mean
entirely
sir
at
her
my
boy
that
just
the
start
the
foundation
you
develop
from
that
but
you
keep
away
that
the
point
i
thought
this
thing
out
mind
you
i
do
claim
absolutely
all
the
credit
for
the
idea
myself
it
by
way
of
being
based
on
christian
science
absent
treatment
and
all
that
but
most
of
it
mine
all
the
fine
work
sir
absolutely
all
the
fine
work
here
the
thing
in
a
nutshell
you
find
the
girl
right
of
course
you
got
to
meet
her
once
just
to
establish
the
connexion
then
you
get
busy
first
week
looks
just
look
at
her
second
week
letters
write
to
her
every
day
third
week
flowers
send
her
some
every
afternoon
fourth
week
presents
with
a
bit
more
class
about
them
bit
of
jewellery
now
and
then
see
what
i
mean
fifth
week
lunches
and
suppers
and
things
sixth
week
propose
though
you
can
do
it
in
the
fifth
week
if
you
see
a
chance
you
got
to
leave
that
to
the
fellow
judgement
well
there
you
are
see
what
i
mean
wilson
stropped
his
master
razor
thoughtfully
trifle
elaborate
sir
is
it
not
he
said
rollo
thumped
the
counterpane
knew
you
say
that
that
what
nine
fellows
out
of
ten
say
they
want
to
rush
it
i
tell
you
wilson
old
scout
you
rush
it
wilson
brooded
awhile
his
mind
back
in
the
passionate
past
market
bumpstead
sir
the
deuce
is
market
bumpstead
village
sir
where
i
lived
until
i
came
to
london
market
bumpstead
sir
the
prevailing
custom
was
to
escort
the
young
lady
home
from
church
buy
her
some
little
present
some
ribbons
possibly
next
day
take
her
for
a
walk
and
kiss
her
sir
wilson
voice
as
he
unfolded
these
devices
of
the
dashing
youth
of
market
bumpstead
had
taken
on
an
animation
quite
unsuitable
to
a
conscientious
valet
he
gave
the
impression
of
a
man
who
does
not
depend
on
idle
rumour
for
his
facts
his
eye
gleamed
unprofessionally
for
a
moment
before
resuming
its
habitual
expression
of
quiet
introspection
rollo
shook
his
head
sort
of
thing
might
work
in
a
village
he
said
you
want
something
better
for
london
rollo
finch
in
the
present
unsatisfactory
state
of
the
law
parents
may
still
christen
a
child
rollo
was
a
youth
to
whom
nature
had
given
a
cheerful
disposition
not
marred
by
any
superfluity
of
brain
everyone
liked
rollo
the
great
majority
on
sight
the
rest
as
soon
as
they
heard
that
he
would
be
a
millionaire
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
andrew
there
is
a
subtle
something
a
sort
of
nebulous
charm
as
it
were
about
young
men
who
will
be
millionaires
on
the
death
of
their
uncle
andrew
which
softens
the
ruggedest
misanthrope
rollo
mother
had
been
a
miss
galloway
of
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
and
andrew
galloway
the
braces
king
the
inventor
and
proprietor
of
the
inimitable
and
proven
was
her
brother
his
braces
had
penetrated
to
every
corner
of
the
earth
wherever
civilization
reigned
you
would
find
men
wearing
galloway
and
proven
between
rollo
and
this
human
benefactor
there
had
always
existed
friendly
relations
and
it
was
an
open
secret
that
unless
his
uncle
were
to
marry
and
supply
the
world
with
little
galloways
as
well
as
braces
the
young
man
would
come
into
his
money
so
rollo
moved
on
his
way
through
life
popular
and
happy
always
merry
and
bright
that
was
rollo
or
nearly
always
for
there
were
moments
we
all
have
our
greyer
moments
when
he
could
have
wished
that
mr
galloway
had
been
a
trifle
older
or
a
trifle
less
robust
the
braces
potentate
was
at
present
passing
in
excellent
health
through
the
indian
summer
of
life
he
was
moreover
as
has
been
stated
by
birth
and
residence
a
pittsburgh
man
and
the
tendency
of
pittsburgh
millionaires
to
marry
is
notoriously
like
the
homing
instinct
of
pigeons
something
it
may
be
the
smoke
seems
to
work
on
them
like
a
charm
in
the
case
of
andrew
galloway
nature
had
been
thwarted
up
till
now
by
the
accident
of
an
unfortunate
attachment
in
early
life
the
facts
were
not
fully
known
but
it
was
generally
understood
that
his
fiancee
had
exercised
woman
prerogative
and
changed
her
mind
also
that
she
had
done
this
on
the
actual
causing
annoyance
to
all
and
had
clinched
the
matter
by
eloping
to
jersey
city
with
the
prospective
bridegroom
own
coachman
whatever
the
facts
there
was
no
doubt
about
their
result
mr
galloway
having
abjured
woman
utterly
had
flung
himself
with
moody
energy
into
the
manufacture
and
propagation
of
his
and
proven
braces
and
had
found
consolation
in
it
ever
since
he
would
be
strong
he
told
himself
like
his
braces
hearts
might
snap
beneath
a
sudden
strain
not
so
the
and
proven
love
might
tug
and
tug
again
but
never
more
should
the
trousers
of
passion
break
away
from
the
tough
masterful
braces
of
as
mr
galloway
had
been
in
this
frame
of
mind
for
a
matter
of
eleven
years
it
seemed
to
rollo
not
unreasonable
to
hope
that
he
might
continue
in
it
permanently
he
had
the
very
strongest
objection
to
his
uncle
marrying
a
and
as
the
years
went
on
and
the
disaster
did
not
happen
his
hopes
of
playing
the
role
of
heir
till
the
fall
of
the
curtain
grew
stronger
and
stronger
he
was
one
of
those
young
men
who
must
be
heirs
or
nothing
this
is
the
age
of
the
specialist
and
years
ago
rollo
had
settled
on
his
career
even
as
a
boy
hardly
capable
of
connected
thought
he
had
been
convinced
that
his
speciality
the
one
thing
he
could
do
really
well
was
to
inherit
money
all
he
wanted
was
a
chance
it
would
be
bitter
if
fate
should
withhold
it
from
him
he
did
not
object
on
principle
to
men
marrying
on
the
contrary
he
wanted
to
marry
one
himself
it
was
this
fact
which
had
given
that
turn
to
his
thoughts
which
had
finally
resulted
in
the
schedule
the
first
intimation
that
wilson
had
that
the
schedule
was
actually
to
be
put
into
practical
operation
was
when
his
employer
one
monday
evening
requested
him
to
buy
a
bunch
of
the
best
red
roses
and
deliver
them
personally
with
a
note
to
miss
marguerite
parker
at
the
of
the
duke
of
cornwall
theatre
wilson
received
the
order
in
his
customary
gravely
deferential
manner
and
was
turning
to
go
but
rollo
had
more
to
add
wilson
he
said
significantly
i
understood
you
to
say
sir
i
will
see
to
it
at
once
what
i
mean
third
week
wilson
sir
rollo
remained
for
a
moment
in
what
he
would
have
called
thought
girl
wilson
sir
the
show
yet
sir
should
said
rollo
earnestly
my
advice
old
scout
and
see
it
first
chance
you
get
it
topping
i
had
the
same
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
for
two
weeks
sir
wilson
the
good
old
schedule
you
noticed
any
satisfactory
results
sir
working
on
saturday
night
she
looked
at
me
five
times
she
a
delightful
girl
wilson
nice
quiet
girl
not
the
usual
sort
i
met
her
first
at
a
lunch
at
oddy
she
the
last
girl
on
the
side
i
sure
you
like
her
wilson
have
every
confidence
in
your
taste
sir
see
her
for
yourself
this
evening
do
let
the
fellow
at
the
put
you
off
slip
him
half
a
crown
or
a
couple
of
quid
or
something
and
say
you
must
see
her
personally
are
you
a
close
observer
wilson
think
so
sir
i
want
you
to
notice
particularly
how
she
takes
it
see
that
she
reads
the
note
in
your
presence
i
taken
a
good
deal
of
trouble
over
that
note
wilson
it
a
good
note
well
expressed
watch
her
face
while
she
reading
it
good
sir
excuse
me
sir
had
almost
forgotten
to
mention
it
mr
galloway
rang
up
on
the
telephone
shortly
before
you
came
in
is
he
in
england
mr
galloway
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
occasional
trips
to
great
britain
to
confer
with
the
general
manager
of
his
london
branch
rollo
had
grown
accustomed
to
receiving
no
notice
of
these
visits
arrived
two
days
ago
on
the
sir
he
left
a
message
that
he
was
in
london
for
a
week
and
would
be
glad
if
you
would
dine
with
him
tomorrow
at
his
club
rollo
nodded
on
these
occasions
it
was
his
practice
to
hold
himself
unreservedly
at
mr
galloway
disposal
the
latter
invitations
were
royal
commands
rollo
was
glad
that
the
visit
had
happened
now
in
another
two
weeks
it
might
have
been
disastrous
to
the
schedule
the
club
to
which
the
braces
king
belonged
was
a
richly
but
gloomily
furnished
building
in
pall
mall
a
place
of
soft
carpets
shaded
lights
and
whispers
grave
elderly
men
moved
noiselessly
to
and
fro
or
sat
in
meditative
silence
in
deep
sometimes
the
visitor
felt
that
he
was
in
a
cathedral
sometimes
in
a
turkish
bath
while
now
and
then
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
of
a
more
than
usually
prosperous
dentist
it
was
magnificent
but
not
exhilarating
rollo
was
shown
into
the
where
his
uncle
received
him
there
was
a
good
deal
of
mr
andrew
galloway
grief
gnawing
at
his
heart
had
not
sagged
his
ample
waistcoat
which
preceded
him
as
he
moved
in
much
the
same
manner
as
birnam
woods
preceded
the
army
of
macduff
a
hand
crept
round
the
corner
of
the
edifice
and
enveloped
rollo
in
a
powerful
grip
my
boy
bellowed
mr
galloway
cheerfully
his
voice
was
always
loud
you
come
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
rollo
looked
at
his
uncle
keenly
he
was
not
capable
of
looking
keenly
at
anyone
but
certainly
a
puzzled
expression
came
into
his
face
whether
it
was
the
heartiness
of
the
other
or
the
unusual
cheeriness
of
his
voice
he
could
not
say
but
something
gave
him
the
impression
that
a
curious
change
had
come
over
the
braces
king
when
they
had
met
before
during
the
last
few
years
mr
galloway
had
been
practically
sixteen
stone
five
of
blood
and
iron
one
of
those
stern
soured
men
his
attitude
had
been
that
of
one
for
whom
life
music
had
ceased
had
he
then
inserted
another
record
his
manner
conveyed
that
idea
sustained
thought
always
gave
rollo
a
headache
he
ceased
to
speculate
got
the
same
here
uncle
he
said
brainy
fellow
i
always
like
dining
here
mr
galloway
surveyed
the
somnolent
occupants
of
the
room
with
spirited
scorn
are
going
to
dine
in
this
forsaken
old
mausoleum
i
sent
in
my
resignation
today
if
i
find
myself
wanting
this
sort
of
thing
at
any
time
i
go
to
paris
and
hunt
up
the
morgue
bunch
of
old
bah
i
engaged
a
table
at
romano
that
more
in
my
line
get
your
coat
and
let
be
going
in
the
cab
rollo
risked
the
headache
at
whatever
cost
this
thing
must
be
pondered
over
his
uncle
prattled
gaily
throughout
the
journey
once
he
whooped
some
weird
forgotten
college
yell
dragged
from
the
misty
depths
of
the
past
it
was
passing
strange
and
in
this
unusual
manner
the
two
rolled
into
the
strand
and
drew
up
at
romano
door
mr
galloway
was
a
good
trencherman
at
a
very
early
date
he
had
realized
that
a
man
who
wishes
to
make
satisfactory
braces
must
keep
his
strength
up
he
wanted
a
good
deal
here
below
and
he
wanted
it
warm
and
well
cooked
it
was
therefore
not
immediately
that
his
dinner
with
rollo
became
a
feast
of
reason
and
a
flow
of
soul
indeed
the
two
revellers
had
lighted
their
cigars
before
the
elder
gave
forth
any
remark
that
was
not
purely
gastronomic
when
he
did
jerk
the
conversation
up
on
to
a
higher
plane
he
jerked
it
hard
he
sent
it
shooting
into
the
realms
of
the
soulful
with
a
whiz
he
said
blowing
a
you
believe
in
affinities
rollo
in
the
act
of
sipping
a
liqueur
brandy
lowered
his
glass
in
surprise
his
head
was
singing
slightly
as
the
result
of
some
rather
spirited
bollinger
extra
sec
and
he
wondered
if
he
had
heard
aright
mr
galloway
continued
his
voice
rising
as
he
spoke
boy
he
said
feel
young
tonight
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
hang
it
i
not
so
old
men
have
married
at
twice
my
age
strictly
speaking
this
was
incorrect
unless
one
counted
methuselah
but
perhaps
mr
galloway
spoke
figuratively
times
my
age
he
proceeded
leaning
back
and
blowing
smoke
thereby
missing
his
nephew
agitated
start
times
my
age
five
times
my
age
six
he
pulled
himself
together
in
some
confusion
a
generous
wine
that
bollinger
he
must
be
careful
he
coughed
you
you
are
are
you
rollo
paused
you
thinking
of
getting
married
uncle
mr
galloway
gaze
was
still
on
the
ceiling
great
deal
of
nonsense
he
yelled
severely
talked
about
men
lowering
themselves
by
marrying
actresses
i
was
a
guest
at
a
last
night
at
which
an
actress
was
present
and
a
more
charming
sensible
girl
i
never
wish
to
meet
not
one
of
your
silly
brainless
chits
who
do
know
the
difference
between
lobster
newburg
and
duck
and
who
prefer
sweet
champagne
to
dry
no
sir
not
one
of
your
mincing
affected
kind
who
pretend
they
never
touch
anything
except
a
spoonful
of
cold

give
you
my
word
my
boy
until
i
met
her
i
did
know
a
woman
existed
who
could
talk
so
damned
sensibly
about
a
au
he
suspended
his
striking
tribute
in
order
to
relight
his
cigar
can
use
a
he
resumed
his
voice
vibrating
with
emotion
told
me
so
she
said
she
could
fix
chicken
so
that
a
man
would
leave
home
for
it
he
paused
momentarily
overcome
welsh
rarebits
he
added
reverently
he
puffed
hard
at
his
cigar
he
said
rarebits
too
and
because
he
shouted
wrathfully
forsooth
she
earns
an
honest
living
by
singing
in
the
chorus
of
a
comic
opera
a
whole
bunch
of
snivelling
idiots
will
say
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
let
them
he
bellowed
sitting
up
and
glaring
at
rollo
say
let
them
i
show
them
that
andrew
galloway
is
not
the
man
to
to
is
not
the
man
he
stopped
anyway
i
show
them
he
concluded
rather
lamely
rollo
eyed
him
with
fallen
jaw
his
liqueur
had
turned
to
wormwood
he
had
been
fearing
this
for
years
you
may
drive
out
nature
with
a
pitchfork
but
she
will
return
blood
will
tell
once
a
pittsburgh
millionaire
always
a
pittsburgh
millionaire
for
eleven
years
his
uncle
had
fought
against
his
natural
propensities
with
apparent
success
but
nature
had
won
in
the
end
his
words
could
have
no
other
meaning
andrew
galloway
was
going
to
marry
a
mr
galloway
rapped
on
the
table
and
ordered
another
kummel
parker
he
roared
dreamily
rolling
the
words
round
his
tongue
like
port
parker
exclaimed
rollo
bounding
in
his
chair
his
uncle
met
his
eye
sternly
was
the
name
i
said
you
seem
to
know
it
perhaps
you
have
something
to
say
against
the
lady
eh
have
you
have
you
i
warn
you
to
be
careful
what
do
you
know
of
miss
parker
speak
no
no
oh
no
i
just
know
the
name
that
all
i
i
rather
think
i
met
her
once
at
lunch
or
it
may
have
been
somebody
else
i
know
it
was
someone
he
plunged
at
his
glass
his
uncle
gaze
relaxed
its
austerity
hope
you
will
meet
her
many
more
times
at
lunch
my
boy
i
hope
you
will
come
to
look
upon
her
as
a
second
mother
this
was
where
rollo
asked
if
he
might
have
a
little
more
brandy
when
the
restorative
came
he
drank
it
at
a
gulp
then
looked
across
at
his
uncle
the
great
man
still
mused
when
is
it
to
be
asked
rollo
wedding
and
all
that
before
the
fall
i
think
no
not
before
the
fall
i
shall
be
busy
till
then
i
have
taken
no
steps
in
the
matter
yet
steps
you
mean
have
you
have
you
proposed
have
had
no
time
be
reasonable
my
boy
be
reasonable
said
rollo
he
breathed
a
long
breath
a
suspicion
of
silver
lining
had
become
visible
through
the
clouds
doubt
said
mr
galloway
meditatively
i
shall
be
able
to
find
time
till
the
end
of
the
week
i
am
very
busy
let
me
see
tomorrow
no
meeting
of
the
shareholders
thursday
friday
no
no
it
will
have
to
stand
over
till
saturday
after
saturday
matinee
that
will
do
excellently
there
is
a
dramatic
spectacle
to
be
observed
every
day
in
this
land
of
ours
which
though
deserving
of
recognition
no
artist
has
yet
pictured
on
canvas
we
allude
to
the
suburban
sudden
flash
of
speed
everyone
must
have
seen
at
one
time
or
another
a
happy
holder
strolling
placidly
towards
the
station
humming
perhaps
in
his
some
gay
air
he
feels
secure
fate
can
not
touch
him
for
he
has
left
himself
for
once
plenty
of
time
to
catch
that
for
which
he
has
so
often
sprinted
like
the
gazelle
of
the
prairie
as
he
strolls
suddenly
his
eye
falls
on
the
church
clock
the
next
moment
with
a
passionate
cry
he
is
endeavouring
to
lower
his
record
for
the
dash
all
the
while
his
watch
has
been
fifteen
minutes
slow
in
just
such
a
case
was
rollo
finch
he
had
fancied
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
and
now
in
an
instant
the
fact
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
he
must
hurry
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
of
his
uncle
dinner
he
lay
sleepless
vainly
endeavouring
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
it
was
not
till
early
morning
that
he
faced
the
inevitable
he
hated
to
abandon
the
schedule
to
do
so
meant
changing
a
advance
into
a
forlorn
hope
but
circumstances
compelled
it
there
are
moments
when
speed
alone
can
save
love
holder
on
the
following
afternoon
he
acted
it
was
no
occasion
for
stint
he
had
to
condense
into
one
day
the
carefully
considered
movements
of
two
weeks
and
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
did
so
he
bought
three
bouquets
a
bracelet
and
a
gold
billiken
with
ruby
eyes
and
sent
them
to
the
theatre
by
with
them
went
an
invitation
to
supper
then
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
done
all
that
was
possible
he
returned
to
his
flat
and
waited
for
the
hour
he
dressed
with
more
than
usual
care
that
night
your
wise
general
never
throws
away
a
move
he
was
particular
about
his
tie
as
a
rule
wilson
selected
one
for
him
but
there
had
been
times
when
wilson
had
made
mistakes
one
could
not
rely
absolutely
on
wilson
taste
in
ties
he
did
not
blame
him
better
men
than
wilson
had
gone
wrong
over
an
evening
tie
but
tonight
there
must
be
no
taking
of
chances
do
we
keep
our
ties
wilson
he
asked
closet
to
the
right
of
the
door
sir
the
first
twelve
shallow
shelves
counting
from
the
top
sir
they
contain
a
fair
selection
of
our
various
cravats
replicas
in
bulk
are
to
be
found
in
the
third
nest
of
drawers
in
your
sir
only
want
one
my
good
man
i
not
a
regiment
ah
i
stake
all
on
this
one
not
a
word
wilson
no
discussion
this
is
the
tie
i
wear
what
the
time
minutes
to
eleven
sir
must
be
off
i
shall
be
late
i
sha
want
you
any
more
tonight
do
wait
for
me
good
sir
rollo
left
the
room
pale
but
determined
and
hailed
a
taxi
it
is
a
pleasant
spot
the
vestibule
of
the
carlton
hotel
glare
glitter
distant
music
fair
women
brave
men
but
one
can
have
too
much
of
it
and
as
the
moments
pass
and
she
does
not
arrive
a
chill
seems
to
creep
into
the
atmosphere
we
wait
on
hoping
against
hope
and
at
last
just
as
waiters
and
commissionaires
are
beginning
to
eye
us
with
suspicion
we
face
the
truth
she
is
not
coming
then
out
we
crawl
into
cold
callous
pall
mall
and
so
home
you
have
been
through
it
dear
reader
and
so
have
i
and
so
at
eleven
that
evening
had
rollo
for
a
full
of
an
hour
he
waited
scanning
the
face
of
each
new
arrival
with
the
anxious
scrutiny
of
a
lost
dog
seeking
its
master
but
at
fourteen
minutes
to
twelve
the
last
faint
flicker
of
hope
had
died
away
a
girl
may
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
for
supper
she
may
be
half
an
hour
late
but
there
is
a
limit
and
to
rollo
mind
minutes
passed
it
at
ten
minutes
to
twelve
a
uniformed
official
outside
the
carlton
signalled
to
a
and
there
entered
it
a
young
man
whose
faith
in
woman
was
dead
rollo
meditated
bitterly
as
he
drove
home
it
was
not
so
much
the
fact
that
she
had
not
come
that
stirred
him
many
things
may
keep
a
girl
from
supper
it
was
the
calm
way
in
which
she
had
ignored
the
invitation
when
you
send
a
girl
three
bouquets
a
bracelet
and
a
gold
billiken
with
ruby
eyes
you
do
not
expect
an
entire
absence
of
recognition
even
a
machine
treats
you
better
than
that
it
may
give
you
hairpins
when
you
want
matches
but
at
least
it
takes
some
notice
of
you
he
was
still
deep
in
gloomy
thought
when
he
inserted
his
latchkey
and
opened
the
door
of
his
flat
he
was
roused
from
his
reflections
by
a
laugh
from
the
he
started
it
was
a
pleasant
laugh
and
musical
but
it
sent
rollo
diving
outraged
for
the
handle
of
the
door
what
was
a
woman
doing
in
his
at
this
hour
was
his
flat
an
hotel
the
advent
of
an
unbidden
guest
rarely
fails
to
produce
a
certain
the
sudden
appearance
of
rollo
caused
a
dead
silence
it
was
broken
by
the
fall
of
a
chair
on
the
carpet
as
wilson
rose
hurriedly
to
his
feet
rollo
stood
in
the
doorway
an
impressive
statue
of
restrained
indignation
he
could
see
the
outlying
portions
of
a
girl
in
blue
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
but
wilson
obscured
his
vision
expect
you
back
sir
said
wilson
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
his
accustomed
calm
seemed
somewhat
ruffled
i
should
think
said
rollo
believe
you
by
george
had
better
explain
jim
said
a
dispassionate
voice
from
the
end
of
the
table
wilson
stepped
aside
wife
sir
he
said
apologetically
but
with
pride
wife
were
married
this
morning
sir
the
lady
nodded
cheerfully
at
rollo
she
was
small
and
slight
with
an
impudent
nose
and
a
mass
of
brown
hair
glad
to
meet
you
she
said
cracking
a
walnut
rollo
gaped
she
looked
at
him
again
met
have
we
oh
yes
i
remember
we
met
at
lunch
once
and
you
sent
me
some
flowers
it
was
ever
so
kind
of
you
she
said
beaming
she
cracked
another
nut
she
seemed
to
consider
that
the
introductions
were
complete
and
that
formality
could
now
be
dispensed
with
once
more
she
appeared
at
peace
with
all
men
the
situation
was
slipping
from
rollo
grip
he
continued
to
gape
then
he
remembered
his
grievance
think
you
might
have
let
me
know
you
were
coming
to
supper
sent
a
note
to
the
theatre
this
afternoon
have
been
to
the
theatre
today
they
let
me
off
because
i
was
going
to
be
married
i
so
sorry
i
hope
you
did
wait
long
rollo
resentment
melted
before
the
friendliness
of
her
smile
any
time
he
said
untruthfully
i
might
explain
sir
said
wilson
george
if
you
can
you
save
me
from
a
brainstorm
cut
loose
and
do
be
afraid
you
bore
me
you
wo
wilson
and
i
are
old
friends
sir
we
come
from
the
same
town
in
fact
rollo
face
cleared
george
market
why
of
course
then
she
so
sir
if
you
recollect
you
asked
me
once
if
i
had
ever
been
in
love
and
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
it
was
wilson
and
i
were
engaged
to
be
married
before
either
of
us
came
to
london
there
was
a
misunderstanding
which
was
entirely
my
it
was
mine
it
was
all
through
my
being
a
fool
was
not
you
know
it
was
rollo
intervened
when
you
sent
me
with
the
flowers
sir
well
we
talked
it
over
again
and
that
was
how
it
came
about
sir
the
bride
looked
up
from
her
walnuts
are
angry
she
smiled
up
at
rollo
he
reflected
of
course
it
was
only
reasonable
that
he
should
be
a
little
well
not
exactly
angry
but
and
then
for
the
first
time
it
came
to
him
that
the
situation
was
not
entirely
without
its
compensations
until
that
moment
he
had
completely
forgotten
mr
galloway
he
said
scott
no
jolly
glad
i
came
back
in
time
to
get
a
bit
of
the
i
want
it
i
can
tell
you
hungry
here
we
all
are
eh
let
enjoy
ourselves
wilson
old
scout
bustle
about
and
give
us
your
imitation
of
a
bridegroom
mixing
a
and
for
the
best
man
mrs
wilson
if
you
look
in
at
the
theatre
tomorrow
you
find
one
or
two
small
wedding
presents
waiting
for
you
three
bouquets
they
be
a
bit
withered
i
afraid
a
bracelet
and
a
gold
billiken
with
ruby
eyes
i
hope

bring
you
luck
oh
wilson
this
little
business
do
answer
if
it
a
delicate
question
but
i
like
to
know
i
suppose
you
did
try
the
schedule
what
more
the
market
thingummy
method
eh
the
one
you
described
to
me
bumpstead
sir
said
wilson
those
lines
rollo
nodded
thoughtfully
seems
to
me
he
said
know
a
thing
or
two
down
in
market
bumpstead
very
rising
little
place
sir
assented
wilson
sir
agravaine
a
tale
of
king
arthur
round
table
some
time
ago
when
spending
a
delightful
at
the
ancestral
castle
of
my
dear
old
friend
the
duke
of
weatherstonhope
pronounced
wop
i
came
across
an
old
ms
it
is
on
this
that
the
story
which
follows
is
based
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
touch
the
thing
up
a
little
here
and
there
for
writers
in
those
days
were
weak
in
construction
their
idea
of
telling
a
story
was
to
take
a
long
breath
and
start
droning
away
without
any
stops
or
dialogue
till
the
thing
was
over
i
have
also
condensed
the
title
in
the
original
it
ran
how
it
came
about
that
ye
good
knight
sir
agravaine
ye
dolorous
of
ye
table
round
did
fare
forth
to
succour
a
damsel
in
distress
and
after
divers
journeyings
and
perils
by
flood
and
by
field
did
win
her
for
his
bride
and
right
happily
did
they
twain
live
ever
afterwards
by
ambrose
ye
monk
it
was
a
pretty
snappy
title
for
those
days
but
we
have
such
a
high
standard
in
titles
nowadays
that
i
have
felt
compelled
to
omit
a
few
yards
of
it
we
may
now
proceed
to
the
story
the
great
tournament
was
in
full
swing
all
through
the
afternoon
knights
on
mettlesome
chargers
had
hurled
themselves
on
each
other
spears
to
the
vast
contentment
of
all
bright
eyes
shone
handkerchiefs
fluttered
musical
voices
urged
chosen
champions
to
knock
the
cover
off
their
brawny
adversaries
the
cheap
seats
had
long
since
become
hoarse
with
emotion
all
round
the
arena
rose
the
cries
of
itinerant
merchants
malvoisie
ye
can
not
tell
the
jousters
without
a
all
was
revelry
and
excitement
a
hush
fell
on
the
throng
from
either
end
of
the
arena
a
mounted
knight
in
armour
had
entered
the
herald
raised
his
hand
gemmen
battling
galahad
and
agravaine
the
dolorous
galahad
on
my
right
agravaine
on
my
left
squires
out
of
the
ring
time
a
speculator
among
the
crowd
offered
six
to
one
on
galahad
but
found
no
takers
nor
was
the
public
caution
without
reason
a
moment
later
the
two
had
met
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
agravaine
shooting
over
his
horse
crupper
had
fallen
with
a
metallic
clang
he
picked
himself
up
and
limped
slowly
from
the
arena
he
was
not
unused
to
this
sort
of
thing
indeed
nothing
else
had
happened
to
him
in
his
whole
jousting
career
the
truth
was
that
sir
agravaine
the
dolorous
was
out
of
his
element
at
king
arthur
court
and
he
knew
it
it
was
this
knowledge
that
had
given
him
that
settled
air
of
melancholy
from
which
he
derived
his
title
until
i
came
upon
this
ms
i
had
been
under
the
impression
like
i
presume
everybody
else
that
every
knight
of
the
round
table
was
a
model
of
physical
strength
and
beauty
malory
says
nothing
to
suggest
the
contrary
nor
does
tennyson
but
apparently
there
were
exceptions
of
whom
sir
agravaine
the
dolorous
must
have
been
the
chief
there
was
it
seems
nothing
to
mitigate
this
unfortunate
physical
deficiencies
there
is
a
place
in
the
world
for
the
strong
ugly
man
and
there
is
a
place
for
the
weak
handsome
man
but
to
fall
short
both
in
features
and
in
muscle
is
to
stake
your
all
on
brain
and
in
the
days
of
king
arthur
you
did
not
find
the
populace
turning
out
to
do
homage
to
brain
it
was
a
drug
on
the
market
agravaine
was
a
good
deal
better
equipped
than
his
contemporaries
with
grey
matter
but
his
height
in
his
socks
was
but
five
feet
four
and
his
muscles
though
he
had
taken
three
correspondence
courses
in
physical
culture
remained
distressingly
flaccid
his
eyes
were
pale
and
mild
his
nose
snub
and
his
chin
receded
sharply
from
his
lower
lip
as
if
nature
designing
him
had
had
to
leave
off
in
a
hurry
and
finish
the
job
anyhow
the
upper
teeth
protruding
completed
the
resemblance
to
a
nervous
rabbit
handicapped
in
this
manner
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
should
feel
sad
and
lonely
in
king
arthur
court
at
heart
he
ached
for
romance
but
romance
passed
him
by
the
ladies
of
the
court
ignored
his
existence
while
as
for
those
wandering
damsels
who
came
periodically
to
camelot
to
complain
of
the
behaviour
of
dragons
giants
and
the
like
and
to
ask
permission
of
the
king
to
take
a
knight
back
with
them
to
fight
their
cause
just
as
nowadays
one
goes
out
and
calls
a
policeman
he
simply
had
no
chance
the
choice
always
fell
on
lancelot
or
some
other
popular
favourite
the
tournament
was
followed
by
a
feast
in
those
brave
days
almost
everything
was
followed
by
a
feast
the
scene
was
gay
and
animated
fair
ladies
brave
knights
churls
varlets
squires
scurvy
knaves
malapert
rogues
all
were
merry
all
save
agravaine
he
sat
silent
and
moody
to
the
jests
of
dagonet
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
when
his
neighbour
sir
kay
arguing
with
sir
percivale
on
current
form
appealed
to
him
to
back
up
his
statement
that
sir
gawain
though
a
lacked
the
punch
he
did
not
answer
though
the
subject
was
one
on
which
he
held
strong
views
he
sat
on
brooding
as
he
sat
there
a
entered
the
hall
majesty
he
cried
damsel
in
distress
waits
without
there
was
a
murmur
of
excitement
and
interest
her
in
said
the
king
beaming
the
retired
around
the
table
the
knights
were
struggling
into
an
upright
position
in
their
seats
and
twirling
their
moustaches
agravaine
alone
made
no
movement
he
had
been
through
this
sort
of
thing
so
often
what
were
distressed
damsels
to
him
his
whole
demeanour
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
spoken
the
words
the
use
the
crowd
at
the
door
parted
and
through
the
opening
came
a
figure
at
the
sight
of
whom
the
expectant
faces
of
the
knights
turned
pale
with
consternation
for
the
was
quite
the
plainest
girl
those
stately
halls
had
ever
seen
possibly
the
only
plain
girl
they
had
ever
seen
for
no
instance
is
recorded
in
our
authorities
of
the
existence
at
that
period
of
any
such
the
knights
gazed
at
her
blankly
those
were
the
grand
old
days
of
chivalry
when
a
thousand
swords
would
leap
from
their
scabbards
to
protect
defenceless
woman
if
she
were
beautiful
the
present
seemed
something
in
the
nature
of
a
special
case
and
nobody
was
quite
certain
as
to
the
correct
procedure
an
awkward
silence
was
broken
by
the
king
yes
he
said
the
damsel
halted
majesty
she
cried
am
in
distress
i
crave
help
so
said
the
king
uneasily
flashing
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
rows
of
perturbed
faces
before
him
what
er
what
is
the
exact
nature
of
the
ah
trouble
any
assistance
these
gallant
knights
can
render
will
i
am
sure
be
ah
eagerly
rendered
he
looked
imploringly
at
the
silent
warriors
as
a
rule
this
speech
was
the
signal
for
roars
of
applause
but
now
there
was
not
even
a
murmur
may
say
enthusiastically
he
added
not
a
sound
said
the
king
ever
tactful
now
you
were
saying
am
yvonne
the
daughter
of
earl
dorm
of
the
hills
said
the
damsel
my
father
has
sent
me
to
ask
protection
from
a
gallant
knight
against
a
fiery
dragon
that
ravages
the
dragon
gentlemen
said
the
king
aside
it
was
usually
a
safe
draw
nothing
pleased
the
knight
of
that
time
more
than
a
brisk
bout
with
a
dragon
but
now
the
tempting
word
was
received
in
silence
said
the
king
some
more
silence
the
king
had
recourse
to
the
direct
appeal
gawain
this
court
would
be
greatly
indebted
to
you
if
sir
gawain
said
he
had
strained
a
muscle
at
the
last
tournament
pelleas
the
king
voice
was
growing
flat
with
consternation
the
situation
was
unprecedented
sir
pelleas
said
he
had
an
ingrowing
the
king
eye
rolled
in
anguish
around
the
table
suddenly
it
stopped
it
brightened
his
look
of
dismay
changed
to
one
of
relief
a
knight
had
risen
to
his
feet
it
was
agravaine
said
the
king
drawing
a
deep
breath
sir
agravaine
gulped
he
was
feeling
more
nervous
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
never
before
had
he
risen
to
volunteer
his
services
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
and
his
state
of
mind
was
that
of
a
small
boy
about
to
recite
his
first
piece
of
poetry
it
was
not
only
the
consciousness
that
every
eye
except
one
of
sir
balin
which
had
been
closed
in
the
tournament
that
afternoon
was
upon
him
what
made
him
feel
like
a
mild
gentleman
in
a
who
has
asked
the
lady
assistant
if
she
will
have
time
to
attend
to
him
soon
and
has
caught
her
eye
was
the
fact
that
he
thought
he
had
observed
the
damsel
yvonne
frown
as
he
rose
he
groaned
in
spirit
this
damsel
he
felt
wanted
the
proper
goods
or
none
at
all
she
might
not
be
able
to
get
sir
lancelot
or
sir
galahad
but
she
was
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
a
the
fact
was
that
sir
agravaine
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
the
moment
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
damsel
yvonne
he
loved
her
devotedly
to
others
she
seemed
plain
and
unattractive
to
him
she
was
a
queen
of
beauty
he
was
amazed
at
the
inexplicable
attitude
of
the
knights
around
him
he
had
expected
them
to
rise
in
a
body
to
clamour
for
the
chance
of
assisting
this
radiant
vision
he
could
hardly
believe
even
now
that
he
was
positively
the
only
starter
is
sir
agravaine
the
dolorous
said
the
king
to
the
damsel
you
take
him
as
your
champion
agravaine
held
his
breath
but
all
was
well
the
damsel
bowed
sir
agravaine
said
the
king
you
had
better
have
your
charger
sent
round
at
once
i
imagine
that
the
matter
is
pressing
time
and
er
dragons
wait
for
no
man
ten
minutes
later
agravaine
still
dazed
was
jogging
along
to
the
hills
with
the
damsel
by
his
side
it
was
some
time
before
either
of
them
spoke
the
damsel
seemed
preoccupied
and
agravaine
mind
was
a
welter
of
confused
thoughts
the
most
prominent
of
which
and
the
one
to
which
he
kept
returning
being
the
startling
reflection
that
he
who
had
pined
for
romance
so
long
had
got
it
now
in
full
measure
a
dragon
fiery
withal
was
he
absolutely
certain
that
he
was
capable
of
handling
an
argument
with
a
fiery
dragon
he
would
have
given
much
for
a
little
previous
experience
of
this
sort
of
thing
it
was
too
late
now
but
he
wished
he
had
had
the
forethought
to
get
merlin
to
put
up
a
magic
prescription
for
him
rendering
him
immune
to
but
did
dragons
bite
or
did
they
whack
at
you
with
their
tails
or
just
blow
fire
there
were
a
dozen
such
points
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
settled
before
starting
it
was
silly
to
start
out
on
a
venture
of
this
sort
without
special
knowledge
he
had
half
a
mind
to
plead
a
forgotten
engagement
and
go
straight
back
then
he
looked
at
the
damsel
and
his
mind
was
made
up
what
did
death
matter
if
he
could
serve
her
he
coughed
she
came
out
of
her
reverie
with
a
start
dragon
now
said
agravaine
for
a
moment
the
damsel
did
not
reply
fearsome
worm
sir
knight
she
said
at
length
raveneth
by
day
and
by
night
it
breathes
fire
from
its
nostrils
it
said
agravaine
it
you
could
give
some
idea
what
it
looks
like
what
kind
of
it
is
body
is
as
thick
as
ten
stout
trees
and
its
head
touches
the
clouds
it
said
agravaine
thoughtfully
it
sir
knight
i
pray
you
have
a
care
will
said
agravaine
and
he
had
seldom
said
anything
more
fervently
the
future
looked
about
as
bad
as
it
could
be
any
hopes
he
may
have
entertained
that
this
dragon
might
turn
out
to
be
comparatively
small
and
inoffensive
were
dissipated
this
was
plainly
no
debilitated
wreck
of
a
dragon
its
growth
stunted
by
a
body
as
thick
as
ten
stout
trees
he
would
not
even
have
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
giving
the
creature
indigestion
for
all
the
impression
he
was
likely
to
make
on
that
vast
interior
he
might
as
well
be
a
salted
almond
as
they
were
speaking
a
dim
mass
on
the
skyline
began
to
take
shape
said
the
damsel
father
castle
and
presently
they
were
riding
across
the
drawbridge
and
through
the
great
gate
which
shut
behind
them
with
a
clang
as
they
dismounted
a
man
came
out
through
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
courtyard
said
yvonne
is
the
gallant
knight
sir
agravaine
who
has
come
to
it
seemed
to
agravaine
that
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
tackle
our
dragon
said
the
father
come
right
in
earl
dorm
of
the
hills
was
a
small
elderly
man
with
what
agravaine
considered
a
distinctly
furtive
air
about
him
his
eyes
were
too
close
together
and
he
was
with
a
weak
cunning
smile
even
agravaine
who
was
in
the
mood
to
like
the
whole
family
if
possible
for
yvonne
sake
could
not
help
feeling
that
appearances
were
against
this
particular
exhibit
he
might
have
a
heart
of
gold
beneath
the
outward
aspect
of
a
expert
whose
hobby
was
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
his
exterior
did
not
inspire
a
genial
glow
of
confidence
good
of
you
to
come
said
the
earl
a
pleasure
said
agravaine
have
been
hearing
all
about
the
dragon
great
scourge
agreed
his
host
must
have
a
long
talk
about
it
after
dinner
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
in
the
stately
homes
of
england
for
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
to
take
their
meals
together
the
guests
sat
at
the
upper
table
the
ladies
in
a
gallery
above
them
while
the
usual
drove
of
archers
malapert
rogues
varlets
scurvy
knaves
scullions
and
attached
to
all
medieval
households
squashed
in
near
the
door
wherever
they
could
find
room
the
retinue
of
earl
dorm
was
not
strong
numerically
the
household
being
to
judge
from
appearances
one
that
had
seen
better
days
but
it
struck
agravaine
that
what
it
lacked
in
numbers
it
made
up
in
toughness
among
all
those
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
there
was
not
one
whom
it
would
have
been
agreeable
to
meet
alone
in
a
dark
alley
of
all
those
foreheads
not
one
achieved
a
height
of
more
than
one
point
nought
four
inches
a
sinister
collection
indeed
and
one
which
agravaine
felt
should
have
been
capable
of
handling
without
his
assistance
any
dragon
that
ever
came
into
the
world
to
stimulate
the
asbestos
industry
he
was
roused
from
his
reflections
by
the
voice
of
his
host
hope
you
are
not
tired
after
your
journey
sir
agravaine
my
little
girl
did
not
bore
you
i
trust
we
are
very
quiet
folk
here
country
mice
but
we
must
try
to
make
your
visit
interesting
agravaine
felt
that
the
dragon
might
be
counted
upon
to
do
that
he
said
as
much
yes
the
dragon
said
earl
dorm
was
forgetting
the
dragon
i
want
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
about
that
dragon
not
now
later
on
his
eye
caught
agravaine
and
he
smiled
that
weak
cunning
smile
of
his
and
for
the
first
time
the
knight
was
conscious
of
a
curious
feeling
that
all
was
not
square
and
aboveboard
in
this
castle
a
conviction
began
to
steal
over
him
that
in
some
way
he
was
being
played
with
that
some
game
was
afoot
which
he
did
not
understand
that
in
a
word
there
was
dirty
work
at
the
there
was
a
touch
of
mystery
in
the
atmosphere
which
made
him
vaguely
uneasy
when
a
fiery
dragon
is
ravaging
the
to
such
an
extent
that
the
call
has
been
sent
out
to
the
round
table
a
knight
has
a
right
to
expect
the
monster
to
be
the
main
theme
of
conversation
the
tendency
on
his
host
part
was
apparently
to
avoid
touching
on
the
subject
at
all
he
was
vague
and
elusive
and
the
one
topic
on
which
an
honest
man
is
not
vague
and
elusive
is
that
of
fiery
dragons
it
was
not
right
it
was
as
if
one
should
phone
for
the
police
and
engage
them
on
arrival
in
a
discussion
on
the
day
football
results
a
wave
of
distrust
swept
over
agravaine
he
had
heard
stories
of
robber
chiefs
who
lured
strangers
into
their
strongholds
and
then
held
them
prisoners
while
the
public
nervously
dodged
their
anxious
friends
who
had
formed
subscription
lists
to
make
up
the
ransom
could
this
be
such
a
case
the
man
certainly
had
an
evasive
manner
and
a
smile
which
would
have
justified
any
jury
in
returning
a
verdict
without
leaving
the
box
on
the
other
hand
there
was
yvonne
his
reason
revolted
against
the
idea
of
that
sweet
girl
being
a
party
to
any
such
conspiracy
no
probably
it
was
only
the
earl
unfortunate
manner
perhaps
he
suffered
from
some
muscular
weakness
of
the
face
which
made
him
smile
like
that
nevertheless
he
certainly
wished
that
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
be
deprived
of
his
sword
and
armour
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
earl
remark
that
the
latter
needed
polishing
and
the
former
stropping
betrayed
only
a
kindly
consideration
for
his
guest
now
it
had
the
aspect
of
being
part
of
a
plot
on
the
other
hand
here
philosophy
came
to
his
rescue
if
anybody
did
mean
to
start
anything
his
sword
and
armour
might
just
as
well
not
be
there
any
one
of
those
mammoth
at
the
door
could
eat
him
armour
and
all
he
resumed
his
meal
uneasy
but
resigned
dinner
at
earl
dorm
was
no
scuffle
it
started
early
and
finished
late
it
was
not
till
an
advanced
hour
that
agravaine
was
conducted
to
his
room
the
room
which
had
been
allotted
to
him
was
high
up
in
the
eastern
tower
it
was
a
nice
room
but
to
one
in
agravaine
state
of
suppressed
suspicion
a
trifle
too
solidly
upholstered
the
door
was
of
the
thickest
oak
studded
with
iron
nails
iron
bars
formed
a
neat
pattern
across
the
only
window
hardly
had
agravaine
observed
these
things
when
the
door
opened
and
before
him
stood
the
damsel
yvonne
pale
of
face
and
panting
for
breath
she
leaned
against
the
doorpost
and
gulped
she
whispered
reader
if
you
had
come
to
spend
the
night
in
the
lonely
castle
of
a
perfect
stranger
with
a
shifty
eye
and
a
rogues
gallery
smile
and
on
retiring
to
your
room
had
found
the
door
and
the
window
barred
and
if
immediately
after
your
discovery
of
these
phenomena
a
young
lady
had
plunged
in
upon
you
and
urged
you
to
immediate
flight
would
that
jar
you
it
jarred
agravaine
he
cried
fly
sir
knight
another
footstep
sounded
in
the
passage
the
damsel
gave
a
startled
look
over
her
shoulder
what
all
this
earl
dorm
appeared
in
the
corridor
his
voice
had
a
nasty
tinkle
in
it
your
daughter
said
agravaine
hurriedly
just
telling
me
that
breakfast
would
the
sentence
remained
unfinished
a
sudden
movement
of
the
earl
hand
and
the
great
door
banged
in
his
face
there
came
the
sound
of
a
bolt
shooting
into
its
socket
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
he
was
trapped
outside
the
earl
had
seized
his
daughter
by
the
wrist
and
was
administering
a
paternal
were
you
saying
to
him
yvonne
did
not
flinch
was
bidding
him
fly
he
wants
to
leave
this
castle
said
the
earl
grimly
have
to
said
yvonne
i
ca
what
ca
his
grip
on
her
wrist
tightened
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
came
the
muffled
sound
of
blows
on
the
solid
oak
said
earl
dorm
ca
eh
well
listen
to
me
you
got
to
do
you
understand
i
admit
he
might
be
but
i
love
him
he
released
her
wrist
and
stared
at
her
in
the
uncertain
light
love
him
what
why
well
i
never
did
understand
women
he
said
at
last
and
stumped
off
down
the
passage
while
this
cryptic
conversation
was
in
progress
agravaine
his
worst
apprehensions
realized
was
trying
to
batter
down
the
door
after
a
few
moments
however
he
realized
the
futility
of
his
efforts
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
to
think
at
the
risk
of
forfeiting
the
reader
respect
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
first
emotion
was
one
of
profound
relief
if
he
was
locked
up
like
this
it
must
mean
that
that
dragon
story
was
fictitious
and
that
all
danger
was
at
an
end
of
having
to
pit
his
inexperience
against
a
ravening
monster
who
had
spent
a
lifetime
devouring
knights
he
had
never
liked
the
prospect
though
he
had
been
prepared
to
go
through
with
it
and
to
feel
that
it
was
definitely
cancelled
made
up
for
a
good
deal
his
mind
next
turned
to
his
immediate
future
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
him
on
this
point
he
felt
tolerably
comfortable
this
imprisonment
could
mean
nothing
more
than
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
disgorge
a
ransom
this
did
not
trouble
him
he
was
rich
and
now
that
the
situation
had
been
switched
to
a
purely
business
basis
he
felt
that
he
could
handle
it
in
any
case
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
sitting
up
so
he
went
to
bed
like
a
good
philosopher
the
sun
was
pouring
through
the
barred
window
when
he
was
awoken
by
the
entrance
of
a
gigantic
figure
bearing
food
and
drink
he
recognized
him
as
one
of
the
scurvy
knaves
who
had
dined
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
the
night
before
a
vast
fellow
with
a
squint
a
mop
of
red
hair
and
a
genius
for
silence
to
attempts
to
engage
him
in
conversation
he
replied
only
with
grunts
and
in
a
short
time
left
the
room
closing
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
he
was
succeeded
at
dusk
by
another
of
about
the
same
size
and
ugliness
and
with
even
less
conversational
this
one
did
not
even
grunt
it
seemed
was
not
an
art
cultivated
in
any
great
measure
by
the
lower
orders
in
the
employment
of
earl
dorm
the
next
day
passed
without
incident
in
the
morning
the
strabismic
with
the
red
hair
brought
him
food
and
drink
while
in
the
evening
the
did
the
honours
it
was
a
peaceful
life
but
tending
towards
monotony
and
agravaine
was
soon
in
the
frame
of
mind
which
welcomes
any
break
in
the
daily
round
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
it
he
had
composed
himself
for
sleep
that
night
and
was
just
dropping
comfortably
off
when
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
he
heard
the
sound
of
angry
voices
it
was
enough
to
arouse
him
on
the
previous
night
silence
had
reigned
evidently
something
out
of
the
ordinary
was
taking
place
he
listened
intently
and
distinguished
words
was
it
i
did
see
thee
coming
down
the
road
with
was
it
thou
didst
see
me
coming
down
the
road
with
who
was
it
i
did
see
thee
coming
down
the
road
with
dost
thou
think
thou
art
do
i
think
that
i
am
who
dost
thou
think
thou
art
agravaine
could
make
nothing
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
hearing
the
first
genuine
that
had
ever
occurred
in
those
dim
days
in
years
to
come
dialogue
on
these
lines
was
to
be
popular
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
great
britain
but
till
then
it
had
been
unknown
the
voices
grew
angrier
to
an
initiated
listener
it
would
have
been
plain
that
in
a
short
while
words
would
be
found
inadequate
and
the
dagger
that
medieval
forerunner
of
the
brought
into
play
but
to
agravaine
all
inexperienced
it
came
as
a
surprise
when
suddenly
with
a
muffled
thud
two
bodies
fell
against
the
door
there
was
a
scuffling
noise
some
groans
and
then
silence
and
then
with
amazement
he
heard
the
bolt
shoot
back
and
a
key
grate
in
the
keyhole
the
door
swung
open
it
was
dark
outside
but
agravaine
could
distinguish
a
female
form
and
beyond
a
shapeless
mass
which
he
took
correctly
to
be
the
remains
of
the
two
is
i
yvonne
said
a
voice
is
it
what
has
been
happening
was
i
set
them
against
each
other
they
both
loved
one
of
the
i
made
them
jealous
i
told
walt
privily
that
she
had
favoured
dickon
and
dickon
privily
that
she
loved
walt
and
now
she
glanced
at
the
shapeless
heap
and
shuddered
agravaine
nodded
for
her
he
said
reverently
i
do
care
i
did
it
to
save
you
but
come
we
are
wasting
time
come
i
will
help
you
to
escape
a
man
who
has
been
shut
up
for
two
days
in
a
small
room
is
seldom
slow
off
the
mark
when
a
chance
presents
itself
of
taking
exercise
agravaine
followed
without
a
word
and
together
they
crept
down
the
dark
staircase
until
they
had
reached
the
main
hall
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
the
rhythmic
snores
of
scurvy
knaves
getting
their
eight
hours
softly
yvonne
unbolted
a
small
door
and
passing
through
it
agravaine
found
himself
looking
up
at
the
stars
while
the
great
walls
of
the
castle
towered
above
him
said
yvonne
there
was
a
pause
for
the
first
time
agravaine
found
himself
examining
the
exact
position
of
affairs
after
his
sojourn
in
the
guarded
room
freedom
looked
very
good
to
him
but
freedom
meant
parting
from
yvonne
he
looked
at
the
sky
and
he
looked
at
the
castle
walls
and
he
took
a
step
back
towards
the
door
not
so
sure
i
want
to
go
he
said
fly
fly
sir
knight
she
cried
do
understand
said
agravaine
do
want
to
seem
to
be
saying
anything
that
might
be
interpreted
as
in
the
least
derogatory
to
your
father
in
any
way
whatever
but
without
prejudice
surely
he
is
just
a
plain
ordinary
brigand
i
mean
it
only
a
question
of
a
ransom
and
i
do
in
the
least
object
no
no
her
voice
trembled
would
ask
no
ransom
tell
me
he
kidnaps
people
just
as
a
hobby
do
understand
he
no
i
can
not
tell
you
fly
do
i
understand
she
was
silent
then
she
began
to
speak
rapidly
well
i
will
tell
you
listen
my
father
had
six
children
all
daughters
we
were
poor
we
had
to
stay
buried
in
this
spot
we
saw
no
one
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
of
us
should
ever
marry
my
father
was
in
despair
then
he
said
if
we
can
not
get
to
town
the
town
must
come
to
us
so
he
sent
my
sister
yseult
to
camelot
to
ask
the
king
to
let
us
have
a
knight
to
protect
us
against
a
giant
with
three
heads
there
was
no
giant
but
she
got
the
knight
it
was
sir
sagramore
perhaps
you
knew
him
agravaine
nodded
he
began
to
see
daylight
sister
yseult
was
very
beautiful
after
the
first
day
sir
sagramore
forgot
all
about
the
giant
and
seemed
to
want
to
do
nothing
else
except
have
yseult
show
him
how
to
play
cat
cradle
they
were
married
two
months
later
and
my
father
sent
my
sister
elaine
to
camelot
to
ask
for
a
knight
to
protect
us
against
a
wild
unicorn
who
bit
asked
agravaine
deeply
interested
malibran
of
devon
they
were
married
within
three
weeks
and
my
father
i
ca
go
on
you
understand
now
understand
the
main
idea
said
agravaine
in
my
case
were
to
marry
me
said
yvonne
her
voice
was
quiet
and
cold
but
she
was
quivering
agravaine
was
conscious
of
a
dull
heavy
weight
pressing
on
his
heart
he
had
known
his
love
was
hopeless
but
even
hopelessness
is
the
better
for
being
indefinite
he
understood
now
you
naturally
want
to
get
rid
of
me
before
it
can
happen
he
said
do
wonder
i
not
vain
well
i
go
i
knew
i
had
no
chance
he
turned
she
stopped
him
with
a
sharp
cry
do
you
mean
you
can
not
wish
to
stay
now
i
am
saving
you
me
i
have
loved
you
since
the
moment
you
entered
the
hall
at
camelot
said
agravaine
she
drew
in
her
breath
you
love
me
they
looked
at
each
other
in
the
starlight
she
held
out
her
hands
she
drooped
towards
him
and
he
gathered
her
into
his
arms
for
a
novice
he
did
it
uncommonly
well
it
was
about
six
months
later
that
agravaine
having
ridden
into
the
forest
called
upon
a
wise
man
at
his
cell
in
those
days
almost
anyone
who
was
not
a
perfect
bonehead
could
set
up
as
a
wise
man
and
get
away
with
it
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
live
in
a
forest
and
grow
a
white
beard
this
particular
wise
man
for
a
wonder
had
a
certain
amount
of
rude
sagacity
he
listened
carefully
to
what
the
knight
had
to
say
has
puzzled
me
to
such
an
extent
said
agravaine
i
felt
that
i
must
consult
a
specialist
you
see
me
take
a
good
look
at
me
what
do
you
think
of
my
personal
appearance
you
need
hesitate
worse
than
that
i
am
the
ugliest
man
in
england
you
go
as
far
as
that
said
the
wise
man
politely
and
everybody
else
thinks
so
everybody
except
my
wife
she
tells
me
that
i
am
a
model
of
manly
beauty
you
know
lancelot
well
she
says
i
have
lancelot
whipped
to
a
custard
what
do
you
make
of
that
and
here
another
thing
it
is
perfectly
obvious
to
me
that
my
wife
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
existence
i
have
seen
them
all
and
i
tell
you
that
she
stands
alone
she
is
literally
marooned
in
class
a
all
by
herself
yet
she
insists
that
she
is
plain
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
wise
man
stroked
his
beard
son
he
said
matter
is
simple
true
love
takes
no
account
of
looks
said
agravaine
two
are
affinities
therefore
to
you
the
outward
aspect
is
nothing
put
it
like
this
love
is
a
thingummybob
who
beginning
to
see
said
agravaine
i
meant
was
this
love
is
a
wizard
greater
than
merlin
he
plays
odd
tricks
with
the
eyesight
said
agravaine
put
it
another
way
love
is
a
sculptor
greater
than
praxiteles
he
takes
an
unsightly
piece
of
clay
and
moulds
it
into
a
thing
divine
get
you
said
agravaine
the
wise
man
began
to
warm
to
his
work
shall
we
say
think
i
must
be
going
said
agravaine
promised
my
wife
i
would
be
back
early
might
put
it
began
the
wise
man
perseveringly
understand
said
agravaine
hurriedly
quite
see
now
the
wise
man
sighed
resignedly
sir
knight
he
said
pay
at
ye
desk
and
agravaine
rode
on
his
way
marvelling
the
and
the
plutocrat
the
main
difficulty
in
writing
a
story
is
to
convey
to
the
reader
clearly
yet
tersely
the
natures
and
dispositions
of
one
leading
characters
brevity
brevity
that
is
the
cry
perhaps
after
all
the
style
is
the
best
in
this
drama
of
love
football
association
code
and
politics
then
the
principals
are
as
follows
in
their
order
of
entry
isabel
rackstraw
an
angel
the
hon
clarence
tresillian
a
greek
god
lady
runnymede
a
proud
old
aristocrat
mr
rackstraw
a
city
man
and
radical
politician
more
about
clarence
later
for
the
moment
let
him
go
as
a
greek
god
there
were
other
sides
too
to
mr
rackstraw
character
but
for
the
moment
let
him
go
as
a
city
man
and
radical
politician
not
that
it
is
satisfactory
it
is
too
mild
the
radical
politics
of
other
radical
politicians
were
as
to
the
radical
politics
of
radical
politician
rackstraw
where
mr
lloyd
george
referred
to
the
house
of
lords
as
blithering
backwoodsmen
and
asinine
anachronisms
mr
rackstraw
scorned
to
be
so
guarded
in
his
speech
he
did
not
mince
his
words
his
attitude
towards
a
member
of
the
peerage
was
that
of
the
terrier
to
the
perambulating
cat
it
was
at
a
charity
bazaar
that
isabel
and
clarence
first
met
isabel
was
presiding
over
the
billiken
and
fancy
goods
stall
there
she
stood
that
slim
radiant
girl
bouncing
ardent
youth
out
of
its
father
hard
earned
with
a
smile
that
alone
was
nearly
worth
the
money
when
she
observed
approaching
the
handsomest
man
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
this
is
not
one
of
those
mystery
stories
it
was
clarence
tresillian
over
the
heads
of
the
bevy
of
gilded
youths
who
clustered
round
the
stall
their
eyes
met
a
thrill
ran
through
isabel
she
dropped
her
eyes
the
next
moment
clarence
had
made
his
spring
the
gilded
youths
had
shredded
away
like
a
mist
and
he
was
leaning
towards
her
opening
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
a
yellow
at
sixteen
times
its
face
value
he
returned
at
intervals
during
the
afternoon
over
the
second
they
became
friendly
over
the
third
intimate
he
proposed
as
she
was
wrapping
up
the
fourth
golliwog
and
she
gave
him
her
heart
and
the
parcel
simultaneously
at
six
carrying
four
seven
photograph
frames
five
golliwogs
and
a
billiken
clarence
went
home
to
tell
the
news
to
his
parents
clarence
when
not
at
the
university
lived
with
his
father
and
mother
in
belgrave
square
his
mother
had
been
a
miss
trotter
of
chicago
and
it
was
on
her
dowry
that
the
runnymedes
contrived
to
make
both
ends
meet
for
a
noble
family
they
were
in
somewhat
straitened
circumstances
financially
they
lived
simply
and
without
envy
of
their
rich
on
their
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
they
asked
no
more
it
enabled
them
to
entertain
on
a
modest
scale
clarence
had
been
able
to
go
to
oxford
his
elder
brother
lord
staines
into
the
guards
the
girls
could
buy
an
occasional
new
frock
on
the
whole
they
were
a
thoroughly
happy
contented
english
family
of
the
best
sort
mr
trotter
it
is
true
was
something
of
a
drawback
he
was
a
rugged
old
tainted
millionaire
of
the
old
school
with
a
fondness
for
and
a
tendency
to
give
undue
publicity
to
toothpicks
but
he
had
been
made
to
understand
at
an
early
date
that
the
for
him
was
the
farther
shore
of
the
atlantic
ocean
and
he
now
gave
little
trouble
having
dressed
for
dinner
clarence
proceeded
to
the
library
where
he
found
his
mother
in
hysterics
and
his
father
in
a
state
of
collapse
on
the
sofa
clarence
was
too
to
make
any
comment
a
true
runnymede
he
affected
to
notice
nothing
and
picking
up
the
evening
paper
began
to
read
the
announcement
of
his
engagement
could
be
postponed
to
a
more
suitable
time
whispered
a
voice
from
the
sofa
father
the
old
man
gasped
for
utterance
lost
my
little
veto
he
said
brokenly
at
length
did
you
see
it
last
asked
clarence
ever
practical
that
fellow
rackstraw
cried
the
old
man
in
feeble
rage
bounder
rackstraw
he
the
man
behind
it
all
the
robber
it
was
his
mother
who
spoke
her
voice
seemed
to
rip
the
air
into
a
million
shreds
and
stamp
on
them
there
are
few
things
more
terrible
than
a
chicago
voice
raised
in
excitement
or
anguish
mind
your
pop
and
his
old
veto
he
did
know
he
had
one
till
the
paper
said
he
lost
it
you
listen
to
me
clarence
we
are
ruined
clarence
looked
at
her
inquiringly
much
he
asked
said
his
mother
we
have
sixty
thousand
dollars
a
year
after
this
it
all
we
shall
have
a
low
howl
escaped
from
the
stricken
old
man
on
the
sofa
clarence
betrayed
no
emotion
he
said
calmly
did
it
happen
just
had
a
cable
from
chicago
from
your
he
been
trying
to
corner
wheat
he
always
was
an
impulsive
old
gazook
surely
said
clarence
a
dim
recollection
of
something
he
had
heard
or
read
somewhere
coming
to
him
cornering
wheat
a
rather
profitable
process
said
his
mother
it
is
i
guess
dad
try
at
cornering
wheat
was
about
the
most
profitable
thing
that
ever
happened
to
the
other
fellows
it
seems
like
they
got
busy
and
clubbed
varieties
of
hades
out
of
your
old
he
got
to
give
up
a
lot
of
his
expensive
habits
and
one
of
them
is
sending
money
to
us
how
it
is
on
top
of
that
mind
you
moaned
lord
runnymede
lose
my
little
veto
it
bitter
bitter
clarence
lit
a
cigarette
and
drew
at
it
thoughtfully
do
see
how
we
going
to
manage
on
twelve
thousand
quid
a
year
he
said
his
mother
crisply
revised
his
pronouns
are
she
said
got
to
get
out
and
hustle
clarence
looked
at
her
blankly
clarence
drew
a
deep
breath
well
of
course
mind
you
fellows
work
he
went
on
thoughtfully
was
lunching
with
a
man
at
the
bachelor
only
yesterday
who
swore
he
knew
a
fellow
who
had
met
a
man
whose
cousin
worked
but
i
do
see
what
i
could
do
do
you
know
his
father
raised
himself
on
the
sofa
i
given
you
the
education
of
an
english
gentleman
the
difficulty
said
clarence
you
do
asked
his
mother
i
can
play
footer
by
jove
i
sign
on
as
a
pro
i
take
a
new
name
i
call
myself
jones
i
can
get
signed
on
in
a
minute
any
club
will
jump
at
me
this
was
no
idle
boast
since
early
childhood
clarence
had
concentrated
his
energies
on
becoming
a
footballer
and
was
now
an
exceedingly
fine
it
was
a
pleasing
sight
to
see
him
poised
on
one
foot
in
the
attitude
of
a
salome
dancer
with
one
eye
on
the
man
with
the
ball
the
other
gazing
coldly
on
the
rest
of
the
opposition
forward
line
uncurl
abruptly
like
the
of
a
watch
and
stop
a
hot
one
clarence
in
goal
was
the
nearest
approach
to
an
acrobat
and
society
contortionist
to
be
seen
off
the
stage
he
was
in
brief
hot
stuff
he
had
the
goods
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
momentous
words
when
the
butler
entered
with
the
announcement
that
he
was
wanted
by
a
lady
on
the
telephone
it
was
isabel
disturbed
and
fearful
clarence
she
cried
precious
angel
i
know
how
to
begin
just
like
that
said
clarence
approvingly
topping
you
ca
beat
it
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
i
told
papa
of
our
engagement
and
he
would
hear
of
it
he
you
a
a
what
wrong
i
nothing
of
the
sort
he
must
be
thinking
of
someone
else
preposterous
excrescence
on
the
social
cosmos
he
does
like
your
father
being
an
earl
man
may
be
an
earl
and
still
a
gentleman
said
clarence
not
without
a
touch
of
coldness
in
his
voice
forgot
to
tell
him
that
but
i
do
think
it
would
make
any
difference
he
says
i
shall
only
marry
a
man
who
works
am
going
to
work
dearest
said
clarence
am
going
to
work
like
a
horse
something
i
know
not
what
tells
me
i
shall
be
rather
good
at
work
and
one
day
when
i
said
isabel
hastily
hear
papa
coming
clarence
as
he
had
predicted
found
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
employment
he
was
signed
on
at
once
under
the
name
of
jones
by
houndsditch
wednesday
the
premier
metropolitan
club
and
embarked
at
once
on
his
new
career
the
season
during
which
clarence
tresillian
kept
goal
for
houndsditch
wednesday
is
destined
to
live
long
in
the
memory
of
followers
of
professional
football
probably
never
in
the
history
of
the
game
has
there
been
such
persistent
and
widespread
mortality
among
the
more
distant
relatives
of
and
junior
clerks
statisticians
have
estimated
that
if
all
the
grandmothers
alone
who
perished
between
the
months
of
september
and
april
that
season
could
have
been
placed
end
to
end
they
would
have
reached
from
hyde
park
corner
to
the
outskirts
of
manchester
and
it
was
clarence
who
was
responsible
for
this
holocaust
previous
to
the
opening
of
the
season
sceptics
had
shaken
their
heads
over
the
wednesday
chances
in
the
first
league
other
clubs
had
bought
up
the
best
men
in
the
market
leaving
only
a
mixed
assortment
of
inferior
scotsmen
irishmen
and
northcountrymen
to
uphold
the
honour
of
the
london
club
and
then
like
a
meteor
clarence
tresillian
had
flashed
upon
the
world
of
football
in
the
opening
game
he
had
behaved
in
the
like
a
chinese
cracker
and
exhibited
an
absolutely
impassable
defence
and
from
then
onward
except
for
an
occasional
check
houndsditch
wednesday
had
never
looked
back
among
the
spectators
who
flocked
to
the
houndsditch
ground
to
watch
clarence
perform
there
appeared
week
after
week
a
little
grey
man
insignificant
except
for
a
certain
happy
choice
of
language
in
moments
of
emotion
and
an
enthusiasm
far
surpassing
that
of
the
ordinary
spectator
to
the
trained
eye
there
are
subtle
distinctions
between
football
enthusiasts
this
man
belonged
to
the
comparatively
small
class
of
those
who
have
football
on
the
cerebrum
fate
had
made
daniel
rackstraw
a
millionaire
and
a
radical
but
at
heart
he
was
a
spectator
of
football
he
never
missed
a
match
his
library
of
football
literature
was
the
finest
in
the
country
his
football
museum
had
but
one
equal
that
of
mr
jacob
dodson
of
manchester
between
them
the
two
had
cornered
at
enormous
expense
the
curio
market
of
the
game
it
was
rackstraw
who
had
secured
the
authentic
pair
of
boots
in
which
bloomer
had
first
played
for
england
but
it
was
dodson
who
possessed
the
painted
ball
used
by
meredith
when
a
boy
probably
the
first
thing
except
a
nurse
ever
kicked
by
that
talented
foot
the
two
men
were
friends
as
far
as
rival
connoisseurs
can
be
friends
and
mr
dodson
when
at
leisure
would
frequently
pay
a
visit
to
mr
rackstraw
country
house
where
he
would
spend
hours
gazing
wistfully
at
the
bloomer
boots
buoyed
up
only
by
the
thoughts
of
the
meredith
ball
at
home
isabel
saw
little
of
clarence
during
the
winter
months
except
from
a
distance
she
contented
herself
with
clipping
photographs
of
him
from
the
sporting
papers
each
was
a
little
more
unlike
him
than
the
last
and
this
lent
variety
to
the
collection
her
father
marked
her
enthusiasm
for
the
game
with
approval
it
had
been
secretly
a
great
grief
to
the
old
gentleman
that
his
only
child
did
not
know
the
difference
between
a
linesman
and
an
inside
right
and
more
did
not
seem
to
care
to
know
he
felt
himself
drawn
closer
to
her
an
understanding
as
pleasant
as
it
was
new
and
strange
began
to
spring
up
between
parent
and
child
as
for
clarence
how
easy
it
would
be
to
haul
up
one
slacks
to
practically
an
unlimited
extent
on
the
subject
of
his
emotions
at
this
time
one
can
figure
him
after
the
game
is
over
and
the
gay
throng
has
dispersed
creeping
moodily
but
what
the
use
brevity
that
is
the
cry
brevity
let
us
on
the
months
sped
by
the
began
and
soon
it
was
evident
that
the
final
must
be
fought
out
between
houndsditch
wednesday
and
mr
jacob
dodson
pet
team
manchester
united
with
each
match
the
wednesday
seemed
to
improve
clarence
was
a
gibraltar
among
those
were
delirious
days
for
daniel
rackstraw
long
before
the
fourth
round
his
voice
had
dwindled
to
a
husky
whisper
deep
lines
appeared
on
his
forehead
for
it
is
an
awful
thing
for
a
football
enthusiast
to
be
compelled
to
applaud
in
the
very
middle
of
the
purely
by
means
of
facial
expression
in
this
time
of
affliction
he
found
isabel
an
comfort
to
him
side
by
side
they
would
sit
and
the
old
man
face
would
lose
its
drawn
look
and
light
up
as
her
clear
young
soprano
pealed
out
over
the
din
urging
this
player
to
shoot
that
to
kick
some
opponent
in
the
face
or
describing
the
referee
in
no
uncertain
terms
as
a
reincarnation
of
the
late
mr
dick
turpin
and
now
the
day
of
the
final
at
the
crystal
palace
approached
and
all
england
was
alert
confident
of
a
contest
but
alas
how
truly
does
epictetus
observe
know
not
what
awaiteth
us
round
the
corner
and
the
hand
that
counteth
its
chickens
ere
they
be
hatched
doth
but
step
on
the
the
prophets
who
anticipated
a
struggle
keener
than
any
in
football
history
were
destined
to
be
proved
false
it
was
not
that
their
judgement
of
form
was
at
fault
on
the
run
of
the
season
play
houndsditch
wednesday
manchester
united
should
have
been
the
two
most
teams
in
the
history
of
the
game
forward
the
latter
held
a
slight
superiority
but
this
was
balanced
by
the
inspired
of
clarence
tresillian
even
the
keenest
supporters
of
either
side
were
not
confident
they
argued
at
length
figuring
out
the
odds
with
the
aid
of
stubs
of
pencils
and
the
backs
of
envelopes
but
they
were
not
confident
out
of
all
those
frenzied
millions
two
men
alone
had
no
doubts
mr
daniel
rackstraw
said
that
he
did
not
desire
to
be
unfair
to
manchester
united
he
wished
it
to
be
clearly
understood
that
in
their
own
class
manchester
united
might
quite
possibly
show
to
considerable
advantage
in
some
rural
league
for
instance
he
did
not
deny
that
they
might
sweep
all
before
them
but
when
it
came
to
competing
with
houndsditch
wednesday
here
words
failed
mr
rackstraw
mr
jacob
dodson
interviewed
by
the
weekly
football
stated
that
his
decision
arrived
at
after
a
close
and
careful
study
of
the
work
of
both
teams
was
that
houndsditch
wednesday
had
rather
less
chance
in
the
forthcoming
tourney
than
a
stuffed
rat
in
the
battersea
dogs
home
it
was
his
opinion
that
in
a
contest
with
the
second
eleven
of
a
village
church
lads
brigade
houndsditch
wednesday
might
with
an
effort
conceding
them
that
slice
of
luck
which
so
often
turns
the
tide
of
a
game
scrape
home
but
when
it
was
a
question
of
meeting
a
team
like
manchester
united
here
mr
dodson
shrugging
his
shoulders
despairingly
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
watchful
secretaries
brought
him
round
with
oxygen
throughout
the
whole
country
nothing
but
the
approaching
match
was
discussed
wherever
civilization
reigned
and
in
portions
of
liverpool
one
question
alone
was
on
every
lip
who
would
win
octogenarians
mumbled
it
infants
lisped
it
tired
city
men
trampled
under
foot
in
the
rush
for
their
tram
asked
it
of
the
ambulance
attendants
who
carried
them
to
the
hospital
and
then
one
bright
clear
morning
when
the
birds
sang
and
all
nature
seemed
fair
and
gay
clarence
tresillian
developed
mumps
london
was
in
a
ferment
i
could
have
wished
to
go
into
details
to
describe
in
crisp
burning
sentences
the
panic
that
swept
like
a
tornado
through
a
million
homes
a
little
encouragement
the
slightest
softening
of
the
editorial
austerity
and
the
thing
would
have
been
done
but
no
brevity
that
was
the
cry
brevity
let
us
on
houndsditch
wednesday
met
manchester
united
at
the
crystal
palace
and
for
nearly
two
hours
the
sweat
of
agony
trickled
unceasingly
down
the
corrugated
foreheads
of
the
patriots
in
the
stands
the
men
from
manchester
freed
from
the
fear
of
clarence
smiled
grim
smiles
and
proceeded
to
pile
up
points
it
was
in
vain
that
the
houndsditch
backs
and
halfbacks
skimmed
like
swallows
about
the
field
they
could
not
keep
the
score
down
from
start
to
finish
houndsditch
were
a
beaten
side
london
during
that
black
period
was
a
desert
gloom
gripped
the
city
in
distant
brixton
wives
faced
husbands
at
the
evening
meal
and
the
children
were
sent
early
to
bed
newsboys
called
the
extras
in
a
whisper
few
took
the
tragedy
more
nearly
to
heart
than
daniel
rackstraw
leaving
the
ground
with
the
air
of
a
father
mourning
over
some
prodigal
son
he
encountered
mr
jacob
dodson
of
manchester
now
mr
dodson
was
perhaps
the
slightest
bit
shy
on
the
finer
feelings
he
should
have
respected
the
grief
of
a
fallen
foe
he
should
have
abstained
from
exulting
but
he
was
in
too
exhilarated
a
condition
to
be
magnanimous
sighting
mr
rackstraw
he
addressed
himself
joyously
to
the
task
of
rubbing
the
thing
in
mr
rackstraw
listened
in
silent
anguish
we
had
had
jones
he
said
at
length
what
they
all
say
whooped
mr
dodson
who
jones
we
had
had
jones
we
should
have
he
paused
an
idea
had
flashed
upon
his
overwrought
mind
he
said
here
wait
till
jones
is
well
again
and
let
us
play
this
thing
off
again
for
anything
you
like
a
side
in
my
private
park
mr
dodson
reflected
on
he
said
side
bet
a
million
two
million
three
mr
rackstraw
shook
his
head
scornfully
million
who
wants
a
million
i
put
up
my
bloomer
boot
against
your
meredith
ball
does
that
go
should
say
it
did
said
mr
dodson
joyfully
been
wanting
that
boot
for
years
it
like
finding
it
in
one
christmas
stocking
well
said
mr
rackstraw
let
get
it
fixed
up
honestly
it
is
but
a
dog
life
that
of
the
writer
i
particularly
wished
at
this
point
to
introduce
a
description
of
mr
rackstraw
country
house
and
estate
featuring
the
private
football
ground
with
its
fringe
of
noble
trees
it
would
have
served
a
double
purpose
not
only
charming
the
lover
of
nature
but
acting
as
a
fine
stimulus
to
the
youth
of
the
country
showing
them
the
sort
of
home
they
would
be
able
to
buy
some
day
if
they
worked
hard
and
saved
their
money
but
no
you
shall
have
three
guesses
as
to
what
was
the
cry
you
give
it
up
it
was
brevity
brevity
let
us
on
the
two
teams
arrived
at
mr
rackstraw
house
in
time
for
lunch
clarence
his
features
once
more
reduced
to
their
customary
proportions
alighted
from
the
automobile
with
a
swelling
heart
presently
he
found
an
opportunity
to
slip
away
and
meet
isabel
i
will
pass
lightly
over
the
meeting
of
the
two
lovers
i
will
not
describe
the
dewy
softness
of
their
eyes
the
catching
of
their
breath
their
murmured
endearments
i
could
mind
you
it
is
at
just
such
descriptions
that
i
am
particularly
happy
but
i
have
grown
discouraged
my
spirit
is
broken
it
is
enough
to
say
that
clarence
had
reached
a
level
of
emotional
eloquence
rarely
met
with
among
of
the
first
league
when
isabel
broke
from
him
with
a
startled
exclamation
and
vanished
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
clarence
observed
mr
daniel
rackstraw
moving
towards
him
it
was
evident
from
the
millionaire
demeanour
that
he
had
seen
nothing
the
look
on
his
face
was
anxious
but
not
wrathful
he
sighted
clarence
and
hurried
up
to
him
he
said
been
looking
for
you
i
want
a
word
with
you
thousand
if
you
wish
it
said
clarence
courteously
look
here
said
mr
rackstraw
want
to
explain
to
you
just
what
this
game
means
to
me
do
run
away
with
the
idea
i
had
you
fellows
down
to
play
an
exhibition
game
just
to
keep
me
merry
and
bright
if
houndsditch
wins
today
it
means
that
i
shall
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
and
look
my
in
the
face
instead
of
crawling
round
on
my
stomach
and
feeling
like
a
under
a
do
you
get
that
do
replied
clarence
not
only
that
went
on
the
millionaire
more
i
have
put
up
my
bloomer
boot
against
mr
dodson
meredith
ball
as
a
side
bet
you
understand
what
that
means
it
means
that
either
you
win
or
my
life
is
soured
for
ever
see
have
got
you
said
clarence
then
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
this
today
is
your
day
for
keeping
goal
as
you
never
kept
goal
before
everything
depends
on
you
with
you
keeping
goal
like
mother
used
to
make
it
houndsditch
are
safe
otherwise
they
are
completely
in
the
bouillon
it
one
thing
or
the
other
it
all
up
to
you
win
and
there
four
thousand
pounds
waiting
for
you
above
what
you
share
with
the
others
clarence
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
rackstraw
he
said

dross
i
care
nothing
for
money
all
i
ask
of
you
proceeded
clarence
your
consent
to
my
engagement
to
your
daughter
mr
rackstraw
looked
sharply
at
him
that
he
said
do
think
i
quite
got
it
i
ask
is
your
consent
to
my
engagement
to
your
daughter
man
said
mr
rackstraw
not
without
a
touch
of
admiration
admire
cheek
but
there
is
a
limit
that
limit
you
have
passed
so
far
that
you
need
to
look
for
it
with
a
telescope
refuse
your
consent
never
said
you
were
a
clever
guesser
mr
rackstraw
laughed
one
of
those
nasty
sharp
metallic
laughs
that
hit
you
like
a
bullet
would
you
support
my
daughter
was
thinking
that
you
would
help
to
some
extent
were
were
you
was
mr
rackstraw
emitted
another
of
those
laughs
he
said
off
you
can
take
that
as
coming
from
an
authoritative
source
no
for
you
clarence
drew
himself
up
fire
flashing
from
his
eyes
and
a
bitter
smile
curving
his
expressive
lips
no
meredith
ball
for
you
he
cried
mr
rackstraw
started
as
if
some
strong
hand
had
plunged
an
auger
into
him
he
shouted
clarence
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
silence
come
said
mr
rackstraw
would
let
a
little
private
difference
like
that
influence
you
in
a
really
important
thing
like
this
football
match
would
you
would
would
practically
blackmail
the
father
of
the
girl
you
love
time
old
father
colour
of
his
hair

not
affect
me

day

looking
for
a
good
bandit
like

years
you
make
captain
kidd
look
like
a
preliminary
bout
my
boy
we
be
the
greatest
combination
you
and
i
that
the
city
has
ever
seen
shake
hands
for
a
moment
clarence
hesitated
then
his
better
nature
prevailed
and
he
spoke
rackstraw
he
said
can
not
deceive
you
wo
matter
said
the
enthusiastic
old
man
bet
you
be
able
to
deceive
everybody
else
i
see
it
in
your
eye
my
boy
we
be
the
greatest
name

that
matter

is
tresillian
the
hon
tresillian
i
am
the
younger
son
of
the
earl
of
runnymede
to
a
man
of
your
political
views
nonsense
said
mr
rackstraw
are
political
views
compared
with
the
chance
of
getting
a
like
you
into
the
family
i
remember
isabel
saying
something
to
me
about
you
but
i
did
know
who
you
were
then
am
a
preposterous
excrescence
on
the
social
cosmos
said
clarence
eyeing
him
doubtfully
i
be
one
too
cried
mr
rackstraw
own
i
set
my
face
against
it
hitherto
but
circumstances
alter
cases
i
ring
up
the
prime
minister
on
the
phone
tomorrow
and
buy
a
title
myself
clarence
last
scruple
was
removed
silently
he
gripped
the
old
hand
outstretched
to
meet
his
little
remains
to
be
said
but
i
am
going
to
say
it
if
it
snows
i
am
at
my
best
in
these
tender
scenes
of
idyllic
domesticity
four
years
have
passed
once
more
we
are
in
the
rackstraw
home
a
lady
is
coming
down
the
stairs
leading
by
the
hand
her
little
son
it
is
isabel
the
years
have
dealt
lightly
with
her
she
is
still
the
same
stately
beautiful
creature
whom
i
would
have
described
in
detail
long
ago
if
i
had
been
given
half
a
chance
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
child
stops
and
points
at
a
small
round
object
in
a
glass
case
he
says
said
isabel
is
the
ball
mr
meredith
used
to
play
with
when
he
was
a
little
boy
she
looks
at
a
door
on
the
left
of
the
hall
and
puts
a
finger
to
her
lip
she
says
must
be
quiet
daddy
and
grandpa
are
busy
in
there
cornering
wheat
and
softly
mother
and
child
go
out
into
the
sunlit
garden
in
alcala
in
alcala
as
in
most
of
new
york
apartment
houses
the
schedule
of
prices
is
like
a
badly
rolled
cigarette
thick
in
the
middle
and
thin
at
both
ends
the
rooms
up
are
expensive
some
of
them
almost
as
expensive
as
if
fashion
instead
of
being
gone
for
ever
were
still
lingering
the
top
rooms
are
cheap
the
rooms
cheaper
still
cheapest
of
all
was
the
its
furniture
was
of
the
simplest
it
consisted
of
a
chair
another
chair
a
worn
carpet
and
a
the
had
an
air
of
depression
and
baffled
hopes
for
years
it
had
been
trying
to
look
like
a
bookcase
in
the
daytime
and
now
it
looked
more
like
a
than
ever
there
was
also
a
plain
deal
table
much
stained
with
ink
at
this
night
after
night
sometimes
far
into
the
morning
rutherford
maxwell
would
sit
and
write
stories
now
and
then
it
happened
that
one
would
be
a
good
story
and
find
a
market
rutherford
maxwell
was
an
englishman
and
the
younger
son
of
an
englishman
and
his
lot
was
the
lot
of
the
younger
sons
all
the
world
over
he
was
by
profession
one
of
the
numerous
employees
of
the
new
asiatic
bank
which
has
its
branches
all
over
the
world
it
is
a
sound
trustworthy
institution
and
relatives
would
assure
rutherford
that
he
was
lucky
to
have
got
a
berth
in
it
rutherford
did
not
agree
with
them
however
sound
and
trustworthy
it
was
not
exactly
romantic
nor
did
it
err
on
the
side
of
to
those
who
served
it
rutherford
salary
was
small
so
were
his
prospects
if
he
remained
in
the
bank
at
a
very
early
date
he
had
registered
a
vow
that
he
would
not
and
the
road
that
led
out
of
it
for
him
was
the
uphill
road
of
literature
he
was
thankful
for
small
mercies
fate
had
not
been
up
to
the
present
but
at
least
she
had
dispatched
him
to
new
york
the
centre
of
things
where
he
would
have
the
chance
to
try
instead
of
to
some
spot
off
the
map
whether
he
won
or
lost
at
any
rate
he
was
in
the
ring
and
could
fight
so
every
night
he
sat
in
alcala
and
wrote
sometimes
he
would
only
try
to
write
and
that
was
torture
there
is
never
an
hour
of
the
day
or
night
when
alcala
is
wholly
asleep
the
middle
of
the
house
is
a
sort
of
belt
while
in
the
upper
rooms
there
are
reporters
and
other
nightbirds
long
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
rutherford
would
hear
footsteps
passing
his
door
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
passage
he
grew
to
welcome
them
they
seemed
to
connect
him
with
the
outer
world
but
for
them
he
was
alone
after
he
had
left
the
office
utterly
alone
as
it
is
possible
to
be
only
in
the
heart
of
a
great
city
some
nights
he
would
hear
scraps
of
conversations
at
rare
intervals
a
name
he
used
to
build
up
in
his
mind
identities
for
the
owners
of
the
names
one
in
particular
peggy
gave
him
much
food
for
thought
he
pictured
her
as
bright
and
vivacious
this
was
because
she
sang
sometimes
as
she
passed
his
door
she
had
been
singing
when
he
first
heard
her
name
cut
it
out
peggy
a
girl
voice
had
said
you
get
enough
of
that
tune
at
the
theatre
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
meet
peggy
june
came
and
july
making
an
oven
of
new
york
bringing
close
scorching
days
and
nights
when
the
pen
seemed
made
of
lead
and
still
rutherford
worked
on
sipping
in
his
and
filling
the
sheets
of
paper
slowly
but
with
a
dogged
persistence
which
the
weather
could
not
kill
despite
the
heat
he
was
cheerful
things
were
beginning
to
run
his
way
a
little
now
a
novelette
an
airy
trifle
conceived
in
days
when
the
thermometer
was
lower
and
it
was
possible
to
think
and
worked
out
almost
mechanically
had
been
accepted
by
a
magazine
of
a
higher
standing
than
those
which
hitherto
had
shown
him
hospitality
he
began
to
dream
of
a
holiday
in
the
woods
the
holiday
spirit
was
abroad
alcala
was
emptying
itself
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
too
would
be
able
to
get
away
he
was
so
deep
in
his
thoughts
that
at
first
he
did
not
hear
the
knocking
at
the
door
but
it
was
a
sharp
insistent
knocking
and
forced
itself
upon
his
attention
he
got
up
and
turned
the
handle
outside
in
the
passage
was
standing
a
girl
tall
and
she
wore
a
and
a
costume
the
keynote
of
which
was
a
certain
aggressive
attractiveness
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
as
to
which
particular
brand
of
scent
was
her
favourite
at
the
moment
she
gazed
at
rutherford
dully
like
banquo
ghost
she
had
no
speculation
in
her
eyes
rutherford
looked
at
her
inquiringly
somewhat
conscious
of
his
you
knock
he
said
opening
as
a
man
must
do
with
the
inevitable
foolish
question
the
apparition
spoke
she
said
a
cigarette
afraid
i
have
said
rutherford
apologetically
been
smoking
a
pipe
i
very
sorry
said
the
apparition
afraid
i
have
a
pause
got
a
cigarette
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
conversation
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
too
much
for
rutherford
combined
with
the
heat
of
the
night
it
made
his
head
swim
his
visitor
advanced
into
the
room
arriving
at
the
table
she
began
fiddling
with
its
contents
the
pen
seemed
to
fascinate
her
she
picked
it
up
and
inspected
it
closely
what
call
this
she
said
a
pen
said
rutherford
soothingly
a
pause
got
a
cigarette
rutherford
clutched
a
chair
with
one
hand
and
his
forehead
with
the
other
he
was
in
sore
straits
at
this
moment
rescue
arrived
not
before
it
was
needed
a
brisk
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
passage
and
there
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
second
girl
do
you
think
you
doing
gladys
demanded
the
must
come
butting
into
folks
rooms
this
way
who
your
friend
name
is
maxwell
began
rutherford
eagerly
say
peggy
said
the
seeker
after
cigarettes
dropping
a
sheet
of
manuscript
to
the
floor
rutherford
looked
at
the
girl
in
the
doorway
with
interest
so
this
was
peggy
she
was
little
and
trim
of
figure
that
was
how
he
had
always
imagined
her
her
dress
was
simpler
than
the
other
the
face
beneath
the
was
small
and
the
nose
delicately
the
chin
determined
the
mouth
a
little
wide
and
suggesting
a
pair
of
grey
eyes
looked
steadily
into
his
before
transferring
themselves
to
the
statuesque
being
at
the
table
monkey
with
the
man
inkwell
gladys
come
along
up
to
bed
say
got
a
cigarette
plenty
upstairs
come
along
the
other
went
with
perfect
docility
at
the
door
she
paused
and
inspected
rutherford
with
a
grave
stare
night
boy
she
said
with
haughty
condescension
night
said
rutherford
to
have
met
you
good
night
night
said
rutherford
night
along
gladys
said
peggy
firmly
gladys
went
rutherford
sat
down
and
dabbed
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
feeling
a
little
weak
he
was
not
used
to
visitors
he
had
lit
his
pipe
and
was
his
night
work
preparatory
to
turning
in
when
there
was
another
knock
at
the
door
this
time
there
was
no
waiting
he
was
in
the
state
of
mind
when
one
hears
the
smallest
noise
in
he
cried
it
was
peggy
rutherford
jumped
to
his
feet
you
he
began
pushing
the
chair
forward
she
seated
herself
with
composure
on
the
table
she
no
longer
wore
the
and
rutherford
looking
at
her
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
change
was
an
improvement
do
for
me
she
said
i
just
look
in
i
sorry
about
gladys
she
is
often
like
that
it
the
hot
weather
is
hot
said
rutherford
noticed
it
bully
for
you
back
to
the
bench
for
sherlock
holmes
did
gladys
try
to
shoot
herself
heavens
no
why
did
once
but
i
stole
her
gun
and
i
suppose
she
has
thought
to
get
another
she
a
good
girl
really
only
she
gets
like
that
sometimes
in
the
hot
weather
she
looked
round
the
room
for
a
moment
then
gazed
unwinkingly
at
rutherford
did
you
say
your
name
was
she
asked
maxwell
that
going
some

it

rutherford
with

talking
about

stories
about
the
gibson
hero
and
the
girl
whose
life
he
saved
like

read
the
idea

looked
at

with
a
new
interest
george

one
of

she
eyed
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
burst
out
say
you
do
like
the
bank
certainly
do
you
like
to
strike
some
paying
line
of
business
why
do
you
make
your
fortune
by
hiring
yourself
out
to
a
museum
as
the
biggest
human
clam
in
captivity
that
what
you
are
you
sit
there
just
saying
thanks
and
bai
jawve
thanks
while
a
girl
telling
you

things

rutherford
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter

national
failing

george
night
peggy
she
jumped
down
from
the
table
her
eye
was
caught
by
the
photographs
on
the
mantelpiece
she
began
to
examine
them
are
these
willies
she
said
picking
up
a
group
is
the
football
team
of
my
old
school
the
lout
with
the
sheepish
smirk
holding
the
ball
is
myself
as
i
was
before
the
cares
of
the
world
soured
me
her
eye
wandered
along
the
mantelpiece
and
she
swooped
down
on
a
cabinet
photograph
of
a
girl
who
george
she
cried
he
took
the
photograph
from
her
and
replaced
it
with
a
curious
blend
of
shyness
and
defiance
in
the
very
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
intently
at
it
his
elbows
resting
on
the
imitation
marble
is
it
asked
peggy
up
george
who
this
rutherford
started
he
said
was
thinking
about
something
bet
you
were
you
looked
like
it
well
who
is
she
oh
that
a
girl
peggy
laughed
satirically
as
you
would
say
i
got
eyes
george
noticed
that
said
rutherford
smiling
ones
too
what
would
she
say
if
she
heard
you
talking
like
that
she
came
a
step
nearer
looking
up
at
him
their
eyes
met
would
say
said
rutherford
slowly
i
know
you
love
me
and
i
know
i
can
trust
you
and
i
have
the
slightest
objection
to
your
telling
miss
norton
the
truth
about
her
eyes
miss
norton
is
a
dear
good
little
sort
one
of
the
best
in
fact
and
i
hope
you
be
great
pals
there
was
a
silence
say
that
would
she
said
peggy
at
last
would
peggy
looked
at
the
photograph
and
back
again
at
rutherford
pretty
fond
of
her
george
i
guess
are
you
am
said
rutherford
quietly
she
a
pretty
good
long
way
away
is
she
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
curious
light
in
her
grey
eyes
rutherford
met
her
glance
steadily
to
me
he
said
here
now
and
all
the
time
he
stepped
away
and
picked
up
the
sheaf
of
papers
which
he
had
dropped
at
peggy
entrance
peggy
laughed
night
georgie
boy
she
said
must
keep
you
up
any
more
or
you
be
late
in
the
morning
and
what
would
the
bank
do
then
smash
or
something
i
guess
good
night
georgie
see
you
again
one
of
these
old
evenings
night
peggy
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
heard
her
footsteps
hesitate
stop
and
then
move
quickly
on
once
more
he
saw
much
of
her
after
this
first
visit
gradually
it
became
an
understood
thing
between
them
that
she
should
look
in
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
he
grew
to
expect
her
and
to
feel
restless
when
she
was
late
once
she
brought
the
gladys
with
her
but
the
experiment
was
not
a
success
gladys
was
languid
and
rather
overpoweringly
refined
and
conversation
became
forced
after
that
peggy
came
alone
generally
she
found
him
working
his
industry
amazed
her
george
she
said
one
night
sitting
in
her
favourite
place
on
the
table
from
which
he
had
moved
a
little
pile
of
manuscript
to
make
room
for
her
you
ever
let
up
for
a
second
seems
to
me
you
write
all
the
time
rutherford
laughed
take
a
rest
he
said
there
a
bit
more
demand
for
my
stuff
than
there
is
at
present
when
i
in
the
class
i
write
once
a
month
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
time
travelling
peggy
shook
her
head
travelling
for
mine
she
said
to
me
it
just
cussedness
that
makes
people
go
away
from
broadway
when
they
got
plunks
enough
to
stay
there
and
enjoy
themselves
you
like
broadway
peggy
i
like
broadway
does
a
kid
like
candy
why
do
you
all
right
for
the
time
it
not
my
ideal
and
what
particular
sort
of
little
old
paradise
do
hanker
after
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
looked
dreamily
at
her
through
the
smoke
over
in
england
peggy
there
a
county
called
worcestershire
and
somewhere
near
the
edge
of
that
there
a
grey
house
with
gables
and
there
a
lawn
and
a
meadow
and
a
shrubbery
and
an
orchard
and
a
and
a
big
cedar
on
the
terrace
before
you
get
to
the
and
if
you
climb
to
the
top
of
that
cedar
you
can
see
the
river
through
the
apple
trees
in
the
orchard
and
in
the
distance
there
are
hills
and
all
the
rube
joints
exclaimed
peggy
in
deep
disgust
a
day
of
that
would
be
about
hours
and
a
bit
too
long
for
me
broadway
for
mine
put
me
where
i
can
touch
street
without
and
then
you
can
leave
me
i
never
thought
you
were
such
a
hayseed
george
worry
peggy
it
be
a
long
time
i
expect
before
i
go
there
i
got
to
make
my
fortune
first
anywhere
near
the
john
class
yet
still
some
way
to
go
but
things
are
moving
i
think
do
you
know
peggy
you
remind
me
of
a
little
billiken
sitting
on
that
table
george
i
always
knew
my
mouth
was
rather
wide
but
i
did
think
i
had
billiken
to
the
bad
do
you
do
that
sort
of
candid
friend
stunt
with
she
pointed
to
the
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
the
first
time
since
the
night
when
they
had
met
that
she
had
made
any
allusion
to
it
by
silent
agreement
the
subject
had
been
ruled
out
between
them
the
way
you
never
told
me
her
name
said
rutherford
shortly
else
bite
at
me
george
i
not
hurting
you
tell
me
about
her
interested
does
she
live
in
the
grey
house
with
the
pigs
and
chickens
and
all
them
roses
and
the
rest
of
the
rube
outfit
chummy
george
what
the
matter
with
you
sorry
peggy
he
said
a
fool
it
only
that
it
all
seems
so
damned
hopeless
here
am
i
earning
about
half
a
dollar
a
year
and
still
it
no
use
kicking
is
it
besides
i
may
make
a
with
my
writing
one
of
these
days
that
what
i
meant
when
i
said
you
were
a
billiken
peggy
do
you
know
you
brought
me
luck
ever
since
i
met
you
i
been
doing
twice
as
well
you
my
mascot
for
me
we
all
got
our
uses
in
the
world
have
we
i
wonder
if
it
would
help
any
if
i
was
to
kiss
you
george
you
do
it
one
must
work
a
mascot
too
hard
she
jumped
down
and
came
across
the
room
to
where
he
sat
looking
down
at
him
with
the
round
grey
eyes
that
always
reminded
him
of
a
kitten
nothing
she
turned
away
to
the
mantelpiece
and
stood
gazing
at
the
photograph
her
back
towards
him
what
colour
eyes
has
she
got
mine
than
yours
than
mine
you
think
we
might
talk
about
something
else
she
swung
round
her
fists
clenched
her
face
blazing
hate
you
she
cried
do
i
wish
i
never
seen
you
i
wish
she
leaned
on
the
mantelpiece
burying
her
face
in
her
arms
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobs
rutherford
leaped
up
shocked
and
helpless
he
sprang
to
her
and
placed
a
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
old
girl
she
broke
from
him
you
touch
me
do
you
do
it
gee
i
wish
i
never
seen
you
she
ran
to
the
door
darted
through
and
banged
it
behind
her
rutherford
remained
where
he
stood
motionless
then
almost
mechanically
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
matches
and
relit
his
pipe
half
an
hour
passed
then
the
door
opened
slowly
peggy
came
in
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
were
red
she
smiled
a
pathetic
little
smile
he
took
a
step
towards
her
she
held
out
her
hand
sorry
george
i
feel
mean
old
girl
what
rot
do
you
do
know
how
mean
i
feel
you
been
real
nice
to
me
george
thought
i
look
in
and
say
i
was
sorry
good
night
george
on
the
following
night
he
waited
but
she
did
not
come
the
nights
went
by
and
still
she
did
not
come
and
one
morning
reading
his
paper
he
saw
that
island
of
had
gone
west
to
chicago
things
were
not
running
well
for
rutherford
he
had
had
his
vacation
a
golden
fortnight
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
in
the
catskills
and
was
back
in
alcala
trying
with
poor
success
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
his
work
but
though
the
indian
summer
had
begun
and
there
was
energy
in
the
air
night
after
night
he
sat
idle
in
his
room
night
after
night
went
wearily
to
bed
oppressed
with
a
dull
sense
of
failure
he
could
not
work
he
was
restless
his
thoughts
would
not
concentrate
themselves
something
was
wrong
and
he
knew
what
it
was
though
he
fought
against
admitting
it
to
himself
it
was
the
absence
of
peggy
that
had
brought
about
the
change
not
till
now
had
he
realized
to
the
full
how
greatly
her
visits
had
stimulated
him
he
had
called
her
laughingly
his
mascot
but
the
thing
was
no
joke
it
was
true
her
absence
was
robbing
him
of
the
power
to
write
he
was
lonely
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
new
york
he
was
really
lonely
solitude
had
not
hurt
him
till
now
in
his
black
moments
it
had
been
enough
for
him
to
look
up
at
the
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
and
instantly
he
was
alone
no
longer
but
now
the
photograph
had
lost
its
magic
it
could
not
hold
him
always
his
mind
would
wander
back
to
the
little
ghost
that
sat
on
the
table
smiling
at
him
and
questioning
him
with
its
grey
eyes
and
the
days
went
by
unvarying
in
their
monotony
and
always
the
ghost
sat
on
the
table
smiling
at
him
with
the
fall
came
the
reopening
of
the
theatres
one
by
one
the
electric
signs
blazed
out
along
broadway
spreading
the
message
that
the
dull
days
were
over
and
new
york
was
itself
again
at
the
melody
where
ages
ago
island
of
had
run
its
course
a
new
musical
piece
was
in
rehearsal
alcala
was
full
once
more
the
nightly
snatches
of
conversation
outside
his
door
had
recommenced
he
listened
for
her
voice
but
he
never
heard
it
he
sat
up
waiting
into
the
small
hours
but
she
did
not
come
once
he
had
been
trying
to
write
and
had
fallen
as
usual
to
brooding
there
was
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
in
an
instant
he
had
bounded
from
his
chair
and
turned
the
handle
it
was
one
of
the
reporters
from
upstairs
who
had
run
out
of
matches
rutherford
gave
him
a
handful
the
reporter
went
out
wondering
what
the
man
had
laughed
at
there
is
balm
in
broadway
especially
by
night
depression
vanishes
before
the
cheerfulness
of
the
great
white
way
when
the
lights
are
lit
and
the
human
tide
is
in
full
flood
rutherford
had
developed
of
late
a
habit
of
patrolling
the
neighbourhood
of
street
at
he
found
it
did
him
good
there
is
a
gaiety
a
bonhomie
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
new
york
streets
rutherford
loved
to
stand
on
the
sidewalk
and
watch
the
weaving
stories
round
them
one
night
his
wanderings
had
brought
him
to
herald
square
the
theatres
were
just
emptying
themselves
this
was
the
time
he
liked
best
he
drew
to
one
side
to
watch
and
as
he
moved
he
saw
peggy
she
was
standing
at
the
corner
buttoning
a
glove
he
was
by
her
side
in
an
instant
he
cried
she
was
looking
pale
and
tired
but
the
colour
came
back
to
her
cheeks
as
she
held
out
her
hand
there
was
no
trace
of
embarrassment
in
her
manner
only
a
frank
pleasure
at
seeing
him
again
have
you
been
he
said
could
think
what
had
become
of
you
she
looked
at
him
curiously
you
miss
me
george
you
of
course
i
did
my
work
been
going
all
to
pieces
since
you
went
away
only
came
back
last
night
i
in
the
new
piece
at
the
madison
gee
i
tired
george
we
been
rehearsing
all
day
he
took
her
by
the
arm
along
and
have
some
supper
you
look
worn
out
by
jove
peggy
it
good
seeing
you
again
can
you
walk
as
far
as
rector
or
shall
i
carry
you
i
can
walk
that
far
but
rector
has
your
rich
uncle
died
and
left
you
a
fortune
george
you
worry
peggy
this
is
an
occasion
i
thought
i
was
never
going
to
see
you
again
i
buy
you
the
whole
hotel
if
you
like
supper
do
i
guess
you
getting
quite
the
rounder
george
bet
i
am
there
are
all
sorts
of
sides
to
my
character
never
so
much
as
dreamed
of
they
seemed
to
know
peggy
at
rector
paul
the
head
waiter
beamed
upon
her
paternally
one
or
two
men
turned
and
looked
after
her
as
she
passed
the
waiters
smiled
slight
but
friendly
smiles
rutherford
intent
on
her
noticed
none
of
these
things
despite
her
protests
he
ordered
an
elaborate
and
expensive
supper
he
was
particular
about
the
wine
the
waiter
who
had
been
doubtful
about
him
was
won
over
and
went
off
to
execute
the
order
reflecting
that
it
was
never
safe
to
judge
a
man
by
his
clothes
and
that
rutherford
was
probably
one
of
these
eccentric
young
millionaires
who
did
care
how
they
dressed
said
peggy
when
he
had
finished
said
rutherford
looking
brown
george
been
away
in
the
catskills
as
strong
on
the
rube
proposition
as
ever
but
broadway
has
its
points
too
you
beginning
to
see
that
gee
i
glad
to
be
back
i
had
enough
of
the
wild
west
if
anybody
ever
tries
to
steer
you
west
of
eleventh
avenue
george
do
you
go
there
nothing
doing
how
have
you
been
making
out
at
your
writing
stunt
well
but
i
wanted
you
i
was
lost
without
my
mascot
i
got
a
story
in
this
month
a
long
story
and
paid
accordingly
that
why
i
able
to
go
about
giving
suppers
to
great
actresses
read
it
on
the
train
said
peggy
dandy
do
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
george
you
ought
to
turn
it
into
a
play
there
a
heap
of
money
in
plays
know
but
who
wants
a
play
by
an
unknown
man
know
who
would
want
in
the
if
you
made
it
into
a
play
and
that
winfield
knight
ever
seen
him
saw
him
in
he
clever
it
if
he
gets
a
part
to
suit
him
if
he
does
he
do
amount
to
a
row
of
beans
it
just
a
gamble
this
thing
he
in
now
is
no
good
the
part
does
begin
to
fit
him
in
a
month
he
be
squealing
for
another
play
so
you
can
hear
him
in
connecticut
shall
not
squeal
in
vain
said
rutherford
he
wants
my
work
who
am
i
that
i
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
simple
pleasures
start
on
the
thing
tomorrow
can
help
you
some
too
i
guess
i
used
to
know
winfield
knight
i
can
put
you
wise
on
lots
of
things
about
him
that
help
you
work
up
willie
character
so
it
fit
him
like
a
glove
rutherford
raised
his
glass
he
said
more
than
a
mascot
you
ought
to
be
drawing
a
big
commission
on
everything
i
write
it
beats
me
how
any
of
these
other
fellows
ever
write
anything
without
you
there
to
help
them
i
wonder
what
the
most
expensive
cigar
they
keep
here
i
must
have
it
whatever
it
is
we
popular
playwrights
be
seen
in
public
smoking
any
cheap
stuff
it
was
rutherford
artistic
temperament
which
when
they
left
the
restaurant
made
him
hail
a
are
not
for
young
men
drawing
infinitesimal
salaries
in
banks
even
if
those
salaries
are
supplemented
at
rare
intervals
by
a
short
story
in
a
magazine
peggy
was
for
returning
to
alcala
by
car
but
rutherford
refused
to
countenance
such
an
peggy
nestled
into
the
corner
of
the
cab
with
a
tired
sigh
and
there
was
silence
as
they
moved
smoothly
up
broadway
he
peered
at
her
in
the
dim
light
she
looked
very
small
and
wistful
and
fragile
suddenly
an
intense
desire
surged
over
him
to
pick
her
up
and
crush
her
to
him
he
fought
against
it
he
tried
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
the
girl
at
home
to
tell
himself
that
he
was
a
man
of
honour
his
fingers
gripping
the
edge
of
the
seat
tightened
till
every
muscle
of
his
arm
was
rigid
the
cab
crossing
a
rough
piece
of
road
jolted
peggy
from
her
corner
her
hand
fell
on
his
he
cried
hoarsely
her
grey
eyes
were
wet
he
could
see
them
glisten
and
then
his
arms
were
round
her
and
he
was
covering
her
upturned
face
with
kisses
the
cab
drew
up
at
the
entrance
to
alcala
they
alighted
in
silence
and
without
a
word
made
their
way
through
into
the
hall
from
force
of
habit
rutherford
glanced
at
the
on
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
one
letter
in
his
mechanically
he
drew
it
out
and
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
handwriting
something
seemed
to
snap
inside
him
he
looked
at
peggy
standing
on
the
bottom
stair
and
back
again
at
the
envelope
in
his
hand
his
mood
was
changing
with
a
violence
that
left
him
physically
weak
he
felt
dazed
as
if
he
had
wakened
out
of
a
trance
with
a
strong
effort
he
mastered
himself
peggy
had
mounted
a
few
steps
and
was
looking
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
he
could
read
the
meaning
now
in
the
grey
eyes
night
peggy
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
turned
facing
him
and
for
a
moment
neither
moved
night
said
rutherford
again
her
lips
parted
as
if
she
were
about
to
speak
but
she
said
nothing
then
she
turned
again
and
began
to
walk
slowly
upstairs
he
stood
watching
her
till
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
long
flight
she
did
not
look
back
peggy
nightly
visits
began
afresh
after
this
and
the
ghost
on
the
table
troubled
rutherford
no
more
his
restlessness
left
him
he
began
to
write
with
a
new
vigour
and
success
in
after
years
he
wrote
many
plays
most
of
them
good
pieces
of
work
but
none
that
came
from
him
with
the
utter
absence
of
labour
which
made
the
writing
of
in
the
a
joy
he
wrote
easily
without
effort
and
always
peggy
was
there
helping
stimulating
encouraging
sometimes
when
he
came
in
after
dinner
to
settle
down
to
work
he
would
find
a
piece
of
paper
on
his
table
covered
with
her
schoolgirl
scrawl
it
would
run
somewhat
as
follows
is
proud
of
his
arms
they
are
skinny
but
he
thinks
them
the
limit
better
put
in
a
scene
for
willie
somewhere
thinks
he
has
a
beautiful
profile
could
you
make
one
of
the
girls
say
something
about
willie
having
the
goods
in
that
line
is
crazy
about
golf
is
proud
of
his
french
accent
could
you
make
willie
speak
a
little
piece
in
french
being
winfield
knight
and
so
little
by
little
the
character
of
willie
grew
till
it
ceased
to
be
the
willie
of
the
magazine
story
and
became
winfield
knight
himself
with
improvements
the
task
began
to
fascinate
rutherford
it
was
like
planning
a
pleasant
surprise
for
a
child
like
that
he
would
say
to
himself
as
he
wrote
in
some
speech
enabling
willie
to
display
one
of
the
accomplishments
real
or
imagined
of
the
absent
actor
peggy
read
it
and
approved
it
was
she
who
suggested
the
big
speech
in
the
second
act
where
willie
described
the
progress
of
his
love
affair
in
terms
of
the
from
her
too
came
information
as
to
little
traits
in
the
man
character
which
the
stranger
would
not
have
suspected
as
the
play
progressed
rutherford
was
amazed
at
the
completeness
of
the
character
he
had
built
it
lived
willie
in
the
magazine
story
might
have
been
anyone
he
fitted
into
the
story
but
you
could
not
see
him
he
had
no
real
individuality
but
willie
in
the
play
he
felt
that
he
would
recognize
him
in
the
street
there
was
all
the
difference
between
the
two
that
there
is
between
a
nameless
figure
in
some
cheap
picture
and
a
portrait
by
sargent
there
were
times
when
the
story
of
the
play
seemed
thin
to
him
and
the
other
characters
wooden
but
in
his
blackest
moods
he
was
sure
of
willie
all
the
contradictions
in
the
character
rang
true
the
humour
the
pathos
the
surface
vanity
covering
a
real
diffidence
the
strength
and
weakness
fighting
one
another
alive
my
son
said
rutherford
admiringly
as
he
read
the
sheets
you
do
belong
to
me
at
last
there
came
the
day
when
the
play
was
finished
when
the
last
line
was
written
and
the
last
possible
alteration
made
and
later
the
day
when
rutherford
bearing
the
package
under
his
arm
called
at
the
players
club
to
keep
an
appointment
with
winfield
knight
almost
from
the
first
rutherford
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
met
the
man
before
that
he
knew
him
as
their
acquaintance
progressed
the
actor
was
in
an
expansive
mood
and
talked
much
before
coming
to
business
the
feeling
grew
then
he
understood
this
was
willie
and
no
other
the
likeness
was
extraordinary
little
turns
of
thought
little
expressions
they
were
all
in
the
play
the
actor
paused
in
a
description
of
how
he
had
almost
beaten
a
champion
at
golf
and
looked
at
the
parcel
that
the
play
he
said
said
rutherford
i
read
it
i
just
look
through
it
myself
where
act
i
here
we
are
have
a
cigar
while
you
waiting
rutherford
settled
himself
in
his
chair
and
watched
the
other
face
for
the
first
few
pages
which
contained
some
tame
dialogue
between
minor
characters
it
was
blank
enter
willie
he
said
i
willie
hope
so
said
rutherford
with
a
smile
the
star
part
he
went
on
reading
rutherford
watched
him
with
furtive
keenness
there
was
a
line
coming
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
which
he
was
then
reading
which
ought
to
hit
him
an
epigram
on
golf
a
whimsical
thought
put
almost
exactly
as
he
had
put
it
himself
five
minutes
back
when
telling
his
golf
story
the
shot
did
not
miss
fire
the
chuckle
from
the
actor
and
the
sigh
of
relief
from
rutherford
were
almost
simultaneous
winfield
knight
turned
to
him
a
dandy
line
about
golf
said
he
rutherford
puffed
complacently
at
his
cigar
lots
more
of
them
in
the
piece
he
said
for
you
said
the
actor
and
went
on
reading
of
an
hour
passed
before
he
spoke
again
then
he
looked
up
me
he
said
me
all
the
time
i
wish
i
seen
this
before
i
put
on
the
punk
i
doing
now
this
is
me
from
the
drive
off
the
tee
it
great
say
what
you
have
rutherford
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
mind
in
a
whirl
he
had
arrived
at
last
his
struggles
were
over
he
would
not
admit
of
the
possibility
of
the
play
being
a
failure
he
was
a
made
man
he
could
go
where
he
pleased
and
do
as
he
pleased
it
gave
him
something
of
a
shock
to
find
how
persistently
his
thoughts
refused
to
remain
in
england
try
as
he
might
to
keep
them
there
they
kept
flitting
back
to
alcala
in
the
was
not
a
failure
it
was
a
triumph
principally
it
is
true
a
personal
triumph
for
winfield
knight
everyone
was
agreed
that
he
had
never
had
a
part
that
suited
him
so
well
critics
forgave
the
blunders
of
the
piece
for
the
sake
of
its
principal
character
the
play
was
a
curiously
amateurish
thing
it
was
only
later
that
rutherford
learned
craft
and
caution
when
he
wrote
he
was
a
colt
rambling
unchecked
through
the
field
of
ignorant
of
its
pitfalls
but
with
all
its
faults
in
the
was
a
success
it
might
as
one
critic
pointed
out
be
more
of
a
monologue
act
for
winfield
knight
than
a
play
but
that
did
not
affect
rutherford
it
was
late
on
the
opening
night
when
he
returned
to
alcala
he
had
tried
to
get
away
earlier
he
wanted
to
see
peggy
but
winfield
knight
flushed
with
success
was
in
his
most
expansive
mood
he
seized
upon
rutherford
and
would
not
let
him
go
there
was
supper
a
gay
uproarious
supper
at
which
everybody
seemed
to
be
congratulating
everybody
else
men
he
had
never
met
before
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
somebody
made
a
speech
despite
the
efforts
of
the
rest
of
the
company
to
prevent
him
rutherford
sat
there
dazed
out
of
touch
with
the
mood
of
the
party
he
wanted
peggy
he
was
tired
of
all
this
excitement
and
noise
he
had
had
enough
of
it
all
he
asked
was
to
be
allowed
to
slip
away
quietly
and
go
home
he
wanted
to
think
to
try
and
realize
what
all
this
meant
to
him
at
length
the
party
broke
up
in
one
last
explosion
of
handshaking
and
congratulations
and
eluding
winfield
knight
who
proposed
to
take
him
off
to
his
club
he
started
to
walk
up
broadway
it
was
late
when
he
reached
alcala
there
was
a
light
in
his
room
peggy
had
waited
up
to
hear
the
news
she
jumped
off
the
table
as
he
came
in
she
cried
rutherford
sat
down
and
stretched
out
his
legs
a
success
he
said
tremendous
success
peggy
clapped
her
hands
for
you
george
i
knew
it
would
be
tell
me
all
about
it
was
winfield
good
was
the
whole
piece
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
him
he
rose
and
placed
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
old
girl
i
do
know
what
to
say
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
all
owing
to
you
that
the
piece
has
been
a
success
if
i
had
had
your
help
peggy
laughed
beat
it
george
she
said
you
come
jollying
me
i
look
like
a
playwright
do
i
no
i
real
glad
you
made
a
hit
george
but
do
start
handing
out
any
story
about
it
not
being
your
own
i
did
do
a
thing
did
you
did
everything
did
but
say
do
let
start
quarrelling
tell
me
more
about
it
how
many
calls
did
you
take
he
told
her
all
that
had
happened
when
he
had
finished
there
was
a
silence
guess
you
be
quitting
soon
george
said
peggy
at
last
that
you
made
a
you
be
going
back
to
that
rube
joint
with
the
cows
and
hens
is
that
it
rutherford
did
not
reply
he
was
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
he
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
guess
that
girl
be
glad
to
see
you
she
went
on
you
cable
tomorrow
george
and
then
you
get
married
and
go
and
live
in
the
rube
house
and
become
a
regular
hayseed
and
she
broke
off
suddenly
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
she
whispered
halt
to
herself
be
sorry
when
you
go
george
he
sprang
up
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
he
heard
the
quick
intake
of
her
breath
listen
he
gripped
her
till
she
winced
with
pain
not
going
back
i
never
going
back
i
a
cad
i
a
hound
i
know
i
am
but
i
not
going
back
i
going
to
stay
here
with
you
i
want
you
peggy
do
you
hear
i
want
you
she
tried
to
draw
herself
away
but
he
held
her
love
you
peggy
peggy
will
you
be
my
wife
there
was
utter
astonishment
in
her
grey
eyes
her
face
was
very
white
you
peggy
he
dropped
her
arm
you
peggy
she
cried
he
drew
back
she
cried
sharply
as
if
it
hurt
her
to
speak
would
play
you
such
a
mean
trick
i
too
fond
of
you
george
there
never
been
anybody
just
like
you
you
been
mighty
good
to
me
i
never
met
a
man
who
treated
me
like
you
you
the
only
real
white
man
that
ever
happened
to
me
and
i
guess
i
not
going
to
play
you
a
trick
like
spoiling
your
life
george
i
thought
you
knew
honest
i
thought
you
knew
how
did
you
think
i
lived
in
a
swell
place
like
this
if
you
did
know
how
did
you
suppose
everyone
knew
me
at
rector
how
did
you
think
i
managed
to
find
out
so
much
about
winfield
knight
you
guess
she
drew
a
long
breath
he
interrupted
her
hoarsely
there
anyone
now
peggy
she
said
is
do
love
him
peggy
do
you
him
she
laughed
bitterly
i
do
love
him
come
to
me
dear
he
said
she
shook
her
head
in
silence
rutherford
sat
down
his
chin
resting
in
his
hands
she
came
across
to
him
and
smoothed
his
hair
would
do
george
she
said
it
would
do
listen
when
we
first
met
i
i
rather
liked
you
george
and
i
was
mad
at
you
for
being
so
fond
of
the
other
girl
and
taking
no
notice
of
me
not
in
the
way
i
wanted
and
i
tried
gee
i
feel
mean
it
was
all
my
fault
i
did
think
it
would
matter
there
did
seem
no
chance
then
of
your
being
able
to
go
back
and
have
the
sort
of
good
time
you
wanted
and
i
thought
you
just
stay
here
and
we
be
pals
and
but
now
you
can
go
back
it
all
different
i
could
keep
you
it
would
be
too
mean
you
see
you
do
really
want
to
stop
you
think
you
do
but
you
do
love
you
he
muttered
forget
me
it
all
just
a
broadway
dream
george
think
of
it
like
that
broadway
got
you
now
but
you
do
really
belong
not
like
me
it
not
in
your
blood
so
you
ca
get
it
out
the
chickens
and
roses
you
want
really
just
a
broadway
dream
what
it
is
george
when
i
was
a
kid
i
remember
crying
and
crying
for
a
lump
of
candy
in
the
window
of
a
store
till
one
of
my
brothers
up
and
bought
it
for
me
just
to
stop
the
racket
gee
for
about
a
minute
i
was
the
busiest
thing
that
ever
happened
eating
away
and
then
it
seem
to
interest
me
no
more
broadway
like
that
for
you
george
you
go
back
to
the
girl
and
the
cows
and
all
of
it
it
hurt
some
i
guess
but
i
reckon
you
be
glad
you
did
she
stooped
swiftly
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
miss
you
dear
she
said
softly
and
was
gone
rutherford
sat
on
motionless
outside
the
blackness
changed
to
grey
and
the
grey
to
white
he
got
up
he
felt
very
stiff
and
cold
broadway
dream
he
muttered
he
went
to
the
mantelpiece
and
took
up
the
photograph
he
carried
it
to
the
window
where
he
could
see
it
better
a
shaft
of
sunlight
pierced
the
curtains
and
fell
upon
it
