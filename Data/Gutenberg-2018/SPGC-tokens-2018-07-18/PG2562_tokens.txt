and
toss
about

head
phidippides

alas
would
that
the
had
perished
miserably
who
induced
me
to
marry
your
mother
for
a
country
life
used
to
be
most
agreeable
to
me
dirty
untrimmed
reclining
at
random
abounding
in
bees
and
sheep
and
then
i
a
rustic
married
a
niece
of
megacles
the
son
of
megacles
from
the
city
haughty
luxurious
and
coesyrafied
when
i
married
her
i
lay
with
her
redolent
of
new
wine
of
the
and
abundance
of
wool
but
she
on
the
contrary
of
ointment
saffron
extravagance
gluttony
and
of
colias
and
genetyllis
i
will
not
indeed
say
that
she
was
idle
but
she
wove
and
i
used
to
show
her
this
cloak
by
way
of
a
pretext
and
say
wife
you
weave
at
a
great
rate
servant
servant
we
have
no
oil
in
the
lamp
strep
ah
me
why
did
you
light
the
thirsty
lamp
come
hither
that
you
may
weep
ser
for
what
pray
shall
i
weep
strep
because
you
put
in
one
of
the
thick
wicks
servant
runs
out
after
this
when
this
son
was
born
to
us
to
me
forsooth
and
to
my
excellent
wife
we
squabbled
then
about
the
name
for
she
was
for
adding
hippos
to
the
name
xanthippus
or
charippus
or
callipides
but
i
was
for
giving
him
the
name
of
his
grandfather
phidonides
for
a
time
therefore
we
disputed
and
then
at
length
we
agreed
and
called
him
phidippides
she
used
to
take
this
son
and
fondle
him
saying
when
you
being
grown
up
shall
drive
your
chariot
to
the
city
like
megacles
with
a
xystis
but
i
used
to
say
nay
rather
when
dressed
in
a
leathern
jerkin
you
shall
drive
goats
from
phelleus
like
your
father
he
paid
no
attention
to
my
words
but
poured
a
over
my
property
now
therefore
by
meditating
the
whole
night
i
have
discovered
one
path
for
my
course
extraordinarily
excellent
to
which
if
i
persuade
this
youth
i
shall
be
saved
but
first
i
wish
to
awake
him
how
then
can
i
awake
him
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
how
phidippides
my
little
phidippides
phid
what
father
strep
kiss
me
and
give
me
your
right
hand
phid
there
what
the
matter
strep
tell
me
do
you
love
me
phid
yes
by
this
equestrian
neptune
strep
nay
do
not
by
any
means
mention
this
equestrian
to
me
for
this
god
is
the
author
of
my
misfortunes
but
if
you
really
love
me
from
your
heart
my
son
obey
me
phid
in
what
then
pray
shall
i
obey
you
strep
reform
your
habits
as
quickly
as
possible
and
go
and
learn
what
i
advise
phid
tell
me
now
what
do
you
prescribe
strep
and
will
you
obey
me
at
all
phid
by
bacchus
i
will
obey
you
strep
look
this
way
then
do
you
see
this
little
door
and
little
house
phid
i
see
it
what
then
pray
is
this
father
strep
this
is
a
of
wise
spirits
there
dwell
men
who
in
speaking
of
the
heavens
persuade
people
that
it
is
an
oven
and
that
it
encompasses
us
and
that
we
are
the
embers
these
men
teach
if
one
give
them
money
to
conquer
in
speaking
right
or
wrong
phid
who
are
they
strep
i
do
not
know
the
name
accurately
they
are
minute
philosophers
noble
and
excellent
phid
bah
they
are
rogues
i
know
them
you
mean
the
quacks
the
wretches
the
fellows
of
whose
numbers
are
the
miserable
socrates
and
chaerephon
strep
hold
hold
be
silent
do
not
say
anything
foolish
but
if
you
have
any
concern
for
your
patrimony
become
one
of
them
having
given
up
your
horsemanship
phid
i
would
not
by
bacchus
even
if
you
were
to
give
me
the
pheasants
which
leogoras
rears
strep
go
i
entreat
you
dearest
of
men
go
and
be
taught
phid
why
what
shall
i
learn
strep
they
say
that
among
them
are
both
the
two
causes
the
better
cause
whichever
that
is
and
the
worse
they
say
that
the
one
of
these
two
causes
the
worse
prevails
though
it
speaks
on
the
unjust
side
if
therefore
you
learn
for
me
this
unjust
cause
i
would
not
pay
any
one
not
even
an
obolus
of
these
debts
which
i
owe
at
present
on
your
account
phid
i
can
not
comply
for
i
should
not
dare
to
look
upon
the
knights
having
lost
all
my
colour
strep
then
by
ceres
you
shall
not
eat
any
of
my
good
neither
you
nor
your
but
i
will
drive
you
out
of
my
house
to
the
crows
phid
my
uncle
megacles
will
not
permit
me
to
be
without
a
horse
but
i
go
in
and
pay
no
heed
to
you
exit
phidippides
strep
though
fallen
still
i
will
not
lie
prostrate
but
having
prayed
to
the
gods
i
will
go
myself
to
the
and
get
taught
how
then
being
an
old
man
shall
i
learn
the
subtleties
of
refined
disquisitions
i
must
go
why
thus
do
i
loiter
and
not
knock
at
the
door
knocks
at
the
door
boy
little
boy
disciple
from
within
go
to
the
devil
who
it
is
that
knocked
at
the
door
strep
strepsiades
the
son
of
phidon
of
cicynna
dis
you
are
a
stupid
fellow
by
jove
who
have
kicked
against
the
door
so
very
carelessly
and
have
caused
the
miscarriage
of
an
idea
which
i
had
conceived
strep
pardon
me
for
i
dwell
afar
in
the
country
but
tell
me
the
thing
which
has
been
made
to
miscarry
dis
it
is
not
lawful
to
mention
it
except
to
disciples
strep
tell
it
then
to
me
without
fear
for
i
here
am
come
as
a
disciple
to
the
dis
i
will
tell
you
but
you
must
regard
these
as
mysteries
socrates
lately
asked
chaerephon
about
a
flea
how
many
of
its
own
feet
it
jumped
for
after
having
bit
the
eyebrow
of
chaerephon
it
leaped
away
onto
the
head
of
socrates
strep
how
then
did
he
measure
this
dis
most
cleverly
he
melted
some
wax
and
then
took
the
flea
and
dipped
its
feet
in
the
wax
and
then
a
pair
of
persian
slippers
stuck
to
it
when
cooled
having
gently
loosened
these
he
measured
back
the
distance
strep
o
king
jupiter
what
subtlety
of
thought
dis
what
then
would
you
say
if
you
heard
another
contrivance
of
socrates
strep
of
what
kind
tell
me
i
beseech
you
dis
chaerephon
the
sphettian
asked
him
whether
he
thought
gnats
buzzed
through
the
mouth
or
the
breech
strep
what
then
did
he
say
about
the
gnat
dis
he
said
the
intestine
of
the
gnat
was
narrow
and
that
the
wind
went
forcibly
through
it
being
slender
straight
to
the
breech
and
then
that
the
rump
being
hollow
where
it
is
adjacent
to
the
narrow
part
resounded
through
the
violence
of
the
wind
strep
the
rump
of
the
gnats
then
is
a
trumpet
oh
thrice
happy
he
for
his
surely
a
defendant
might
easily
get
acquitted
who
understands
the
intestine
of
the
gnat
dis
but
he
was
lately
deprived
of
a
great
idea
by
a
lizard
strep
in
what
way
tell
me
dis
as
he
was
investigating
the
courses
of
the
moon
and
her
revolutions
then
as
he
was
gaping
upward
a
lizard
in
the
darkness
dropped
upon
him
from
the
roof
strep
i
am
amused
at
a
lizard
having
dropped
on
socrates
dis
yesterday
evening
there
was
no
supper
for
us
strep
well
what
then
did
he
contrive
for
provisions
dis
he
sprinkled
fine
ashes
on
the
table
and
bent
a
little
spit
and
then
took
it
as
a
pair
of
compasses
and
filched
a
cloak
from
the
palaestra
strep
why
then
do
we
admire
thales
open
open
quickly
the
and
show
to
me
socrates
as
quickly
as
possible
for
i
desire
to
be
a
disciple
come
open
the
door
the
door
of
the
opens
and
the
pupils
of
socrates
are
seen
all
with
their
heads
fixed
on
the
ground
while
socrates
himself
is
seen
suspended
in
the
air
in
a
basket
o
hercules
from
what
country
are
these
wild
beasts
dis
what
do
you
wonder
at
to
what
do
they
seem
to
you
to
be
like
strep
to
the
spartans
who
were
taken
at
pylos
but
why
in
the
world
do
these
look
upon
the
ground
dis
they
are
in
search
of
the
things
below
the
earth
strep
then
they
are
searching
for
roots
do
not
then
trouble
yourselves
about
this
for
i
know
where
there
are
large
and
fine
ones
why
what
are
these
doing
who
are
bent
down
so
much
dis
these
are
groping
about
in
darkness
under
tartarus
strep
why
then
does
their
rump
look
toward
heaven
dis
it
is
getting
taught
astronomy
alone
by
itself
turning
to
the
pupils
but
go
in
lest
he
meet
with
us
strep
not
yet
not
yet
but
let
them
remain
that
i
may
communicate
to
them
a
little
matter
of
my
own
dis
it
is
not
permitted
to
them
to
remain
without
in
the
open
air
for
a
very
long
time
the
pupils
retire
strep
discovering
a
variety
of
mathematical
instruments
why
what
is
this
in
the
name
of
heaven
tell
me
dis
this
is
astronomy
strep
but
what
is
this
dis
geometry
strep
what
then
is
the
use
of
this
dis
to
measure
out
the
land
strep
what
belongs
to
an
allotment
dis
no
but
the
whole
earth
strep
you
tell
me
a
clever
notion
for
the
contrivance
is
democratic
and
useful
dis
pointing
to
a
map
see
here
a
map
of
the
whole
earth
do
you
see
this
is
athens
strep
what
say
you
i
do
believe
you
for
i
do
not
see
the
dicasts
sitting
dis
be
assured
that
this
is
truly
the
attic
territory
strep
why
where
are
my
of
cicynna
dis
here
they
are
and
euboea
here
as
you
see
is
stretched
out
a
long
way
by
the
side
of
it
to
a
great
distance
strep
i
know
that
for
it
was
stretched
by
us
and
pericles
but
where
is
lacedaemon
dis
where
is
it
here
it
is
strep
how
near
it
is
to
us
pay
great
attention
to
this
to
remove
it
very
far
from
us
dis
by
jupiter
it
is
not
possible
strep
then
you
will
weep
for
it
looking
up
and
discovering
socrates
come
who
is
this
man
who
is
in
the
basket
dis
himself
strep
who
himself
dis
socrates
strep
o
socrates
come
you
sir
call
upon
him
loudly
for
me
dis
nay
rather
call
him
yourself
for
i
have
no
leisure
exit
disciple
strep
socrates
my
little
socrates
socrates
why
callest
thou
me
thou
creature
of
a
day
strep
first
tell
me
i
beseech
you
what
are
you
doing
soc
i
am
walking
in
the
air
and
speculating
about
the
sun
strep
and
so
you
look
down
upon
the
gods
from
your
basket
and
not
from
the
earth
soc
for
i
should
not
have
rightly
discovered
things
celestial
if
i
had
not
suspended
the
intellect
and
mixed
the
thought
in
a
subtle
form
with
its
kindred
air
but
if
being
on
the
ground
i
speculated
from
below
on
things
above
i
should
never
have
discovered
them
for
the
earth
forcibly
attracts
to
itself
the
meditative
moisture
also
suffer
the
very
same
thing
strep
what
do
you
say
does
meditation
attract
the
moisture
to
the
come
then
my
little
socrates
descend
to
me
that
you
may
teach
me
those
things
for
the
sake
of
which
i
have
come
socrates
lowers
himself
and
gets
out
of
the
basket
soc
and
for
what
did
you
come
strep
wishing
to
learn
to
speak
for
by
reason
of
usury
and
most
creditors
i
am
pillaged
and
plundered
and
have
my
goods
seized
for
debt
soc
how
did
you
get
in
debt
without
observing
it
strep
a
consumed
me
terrible
at
eating
but
teach
me
the
other
one
of
your
two
causes
that
which
pays
nothing
and
i
will
swear
by
the
gods
i
will
pay
down
to
you
whatever
reward
you
exact
of
me
soc
by
what
gods
will
you
swear
for
in
the
first
place
gods
are
not
a
current
coin
with
us
strep
by
what
do
you
swear
by
iron
money
as
in
byzantium
soc
do
you
wish
to
know
clearly
celestial
matters
what
they
rightly
are
strep
yes
by
jupiter
if
it
be
possible
soc
and
to
hold
converse
with
the
clouds
our
divinities
strep
by
all
means
soc
with
great
solemnity
seat
yourself
then
upon
the
sacred
couch
strep
well
i
am
seated
soc
take
then
this
chaplet
strep
for
what
purpose
a
chaplet
ah
me
socrates
see
that
you
do
not
sacrifice
me
like
athamas
strep
no
we
do
all
these
to
those
who
get
initiated
strep
then
what
shall
i
gain
pray
soc
you
shall
become
in
oratory
a
tricky
knave
a
thorough
rattle
a
subtle
speaker
but
keep
quiet
strep
by
jupiter
you
will
not
deceive
me
for
if
i
am
besprinkled
i
shall
become
fine
flour
soc
it
becomes
the

my
having

then
ye
highly
honoured
clouds
for
a
display
to
this
man

upon
the
sacred
summits
of
olympus
or
in
the
gardens

following
song

at
a
distance
accompanied
by
loud
claps
of
thunder
chorus
eternal
clouds
let
us
arise
to
view
with
our
dewy
nature
from
father
ocean
to
the
summits
of
the
lofty
mountains
in
order
that
we
may
behold
clearly
the
and
the
fruits
and
the
fostering
sacred
earth
and
the
rushing
sounds
of
the
divine
rivers
and
the
roaring
sea

the
unwearied
eye
of
aether

with
glittering
rays
come
let
us
shake
off
the
watery
cloud
from
our
immortal
forms
and
survey
the
earth
with
eye
soc
o
ye
greatly
venerable
clouds
ye
have
clearly
heard
me
when
i
called
turning
to
strepsiades
did
you
hear
the
voice
and
the
thunder
which
bellowed
at
the
same
time
feared
as
a
god
strep
i
too
worship
you
o
ye
highly
honoured
and
am
inclined
to
reply
to
the
thundering
so
much
do
i
tremble
at
them
and
am
alarmed
and
whether
it
be
lawful
or
be
not
lawful
i
have
a
desire
just
now
to
ease
myself
soc
do
scoff
nor
do
what
these
do
but
use
words
of
good
omen
for
a
great
swarm
of
goddesses
is
in
motion
with
their
songs
cho
ye
virgins
let
us
come
to
the
fruitful
land
of
pallas
to
view
the
country
of
cecrops
abounding
in
brave
men
where
is
reverence
for
sacred
rites
not
to
be
divulged
where
the
house
that
receives
the
initiated
is
thrown
open
in
holy
mystic
rites
and
gifts
to
the
celestial
gods
and
temples
and
statues
and
most
sacred
processions
in
honour
of
the
blessed
gods
and
sacrifices
to
the
gods
and
feasts
at
all
seasons
and
with
the
approach
of
spring
the
bacchic
festivity
and
the
rousings
of
melodious
choruses
and
the
music
of
flutes
strep
tell
me
o
socrates
i
beseech
you
by
jupiter
who
are
these
that
have
uttered
this
grand
song
are
they
some
heroines
soc
by
no
means
but
heavenly
clouds
great
divinities
to
idle
men
who
supply
us
with
thought
and
argument
and
intelligence
and
humbug
and
circumlocution
and
ability
to
hoax
and
comprehension
strep
on
this
account
therefore
my
soul
having
heard
their
voice
flutters
and
already
seeks
to
discourse
subtilely
and
to
quibble
about
smoke
and
having
pricked
a
maxim
with
a
little
notion
to
refute
the
opposite
argument
so
that
now
i
eagerly
desire
if
by
any
means
it
be
possible
to
see
them
palpably
soc
look
then
hither
toward
mount
parnes
for
now
i
behold
them
descending
gently
strep
pray
where
show
me
soc
see
there
they
come
in
great
numbers
through
the
hollows
and
thickets
there
obliquely
strep
what
the
matter
for
i
ca
see
them
soc
by
the
entrance
enter
chorus
strep
now
at
length
with
difficulty
i
just
see
them
soc
now
at
length
you
assuredly
see
them
unless
you
have
your
eyes
running
pumpkins
strep
yes
by
jupiter
o
highly
honoured
clouds
for
now
they
cover
all
things
soc
did
you
not
however
know
nor
yet
consider
these
to
be
goddesses
strep
no
by
jupiter
but
i
thought
them
to
be
mist
and
dew
and
smoke
soc
for
you
do
not
know
by
jupiter
that
these
feed
very
many
sophists
thurian
soothsayers
practisers
of
medicine
for
the
cyclic
dances
and
meteorological
quacks
they
feed
idle
people
who
do
nothing
because
such
men
celebrate
them
in
verse
strep
for
this
reason
then
they
introduced
into
their
verses
the
dreadful
impetuosity
of
the
moist
clouds
and
the
curls
of
typho
and
the
tempests
and
then
aerial
moist
birds
floating
in
air
and
the
showers
of
rain
from
dewy
clouds
and
then
in
return
for
these
they
swallow
slices
of
great
fine
mullets
and
of
thrushes
soc
is
it
not
just
however
that
they
should
have
their
reward
on
account
of
these
strep
tell
me
pray
if
they
are
really
clouds
what
ails
them
that
they
resemble
mortal
women
for
they
are
not
such
soc
pray
of
what
nature
are
they
strep
i
do
not
clearly
know
at
any
rate
they
resemble
fleeces
and
not
women
by
jupiter
not
a
bit
for
these
have
noses
soc
answer
then
whatever
i
ask
you
strep
then
say
quickly
what
you
wish
soc
have
you
ever
when
you
looked
up
seen
a
cloud
like
to
a
centaur
or
a
panther
or
a
wolf
or
a
bull
strep
by
jupiter
have
i
but
what
of
that
soc
they
become
all
things
whatever
they
please
and
then
if
they
see
a
person
with
long
hair
a
wild
one
of
these
hairy
fellows
like
the
son
of
xenophantes
in
derision
of
his
folly
they
liken
themselves
to
centaurs
strep
why
what
if
they
should
see
simon
a
plunderer
of
the
public
property
what
do
they
do
soc
they
suddenly
become
wolves
showing
up
his
disposition
strep
for
this
reason
then
for
this
reason
when
they
yesterday
saw
cleonymus
the
recreant
on
this
account
they
became
stags
because
they
saw
this
most
cowardly
fellow
soc
and
now
too
because
they
saw
clisthenes
you
observe
on
this
account
they
became
women
strep
hail
therefore
o
mistresses
and
now
if
ever
ye
did
to
any
other
to
me
also
utter
a
voice
reaching
to
heaven
o
queens
cho
hail
o
ancient
veteran
hunter
after
learned
speeches
and
thou
o
priest
of
most
subtle
trifles
tell
us
what
you
require
for
we
would
not
hearken
to
any
other
of
the
recent
meteorological
sophists
except
to
prodicus
to
him
on
account
of
his
wisdom
and
intelligence
and
to
you
because
you
walk
proudly
in
the
streets
and
cast
your
eyes
askance
and
endure
many
hardships
with
bare
feet
and
in
reliance
upon
us
lookest
supercilious
strep
o
earth
what
a
voice
how
holy
and
dignified
and
wondrous
soc
for
in
fact
these
alone
are
goddesses
and
all
the
rest
is
nonsense
strep
but
come
by
the
earth
is
not
jupiter
the
olympian
a
god
soc
what
jupiter
do
not
trifle
there
is
no
jupiter
strep
what
do
you
say
who
rains
then
for
first
of
all
explain
this
to
me
soc
these
to
be
sure
i
will
teach
you
it
by
powerful
evidence
come
where
have
you
ever
seen
him
raining
at
any
time
without
clouds
and
yet
he
ought
to
rain
in
fine
weather
and
these
be
absent
strep
by
apollo
of
a
truth
you
have
rightly
confirmed
this
by
your
present
argument
and
yet
before
this
i
really
thought
that
jupiter
caused
the
rain
but
tell
me
who
is
it
that
thunders
this
makes
me
tremble
soc
these
as
they
roll
thunder
strep
in
what
way
you
man
soc
when
they
are
full
of
much
water
and
are
compelled
to
be
borne
along
being
necessarily
precipitated
when
full
of
rain
then
they
fall
heavily
upon
each
other
and
burst
and
clap
strep
who
is
it
that
compels
them
to
borne
along
is
it
not
jupiter
soc
by
no
means
but
aethereal
vortex
strep
vortex
it
had
escaped
my
notice
that
jupiter
did
not
exist
and
that
vortex
now
reigned
in
his
stead
but
you
have
taught
me
nothing
as
yet
concerning
the
clap
and
the
thunder
soc
have
you
not
heard
me
that
i
said
that
the
clouds
when
full
of
moisture
dash
against
each
other
and
clap
by
reason
of
their
density
strep
come
how
am
i
to
believe
this
soc
i
teach
you
from
your
own
case
were
you
ever
after
being
stuffed
with
broth
at
the
panathenaic
festival
then
disturbed
in
your
belly
and
did
a
tumult
suddenly
rumble
through
it
strep
yes
by
apollo
and
immediately
the
little
broth
plays
the
mischief
with
me
and
is
disturbed
and
rumbles
like
thunder
and
grumbles
dreadfully
at
first
gently
pappax
pappax
and
then
it
adds
and
finally
it
thunders
downright
papapappax
as
they
do
soc
consider
therefore
how
you
have
trumpeted
from
a
little
belly
so
small
and
how
is
it
not
probable
that
this
air
being
boundless
should
thunder
so
loudly
strep
for
this
reason
therefore
the
two
names
also
trump
and
thunder
are
similar
to
each
other
but
teach
me
this
whence
comes
the
thunderbolt
blazing
with
fire
and
burns
us
to
ashes
when
it
smites
us
and
singes
those
who
survive
for
indeed
jupiter
evidently
hurls
this
at
the
perjured
soc
why
how
then
you
foolish
person
and
savouring
of
the
dark
ages
and
antediluvian
if
his
manner
is
to
smite
the
perjured
does
he
not
blast
simon
and
cleonymus
and
theorus
and
yet
they
are
very
perjured
but
he
smites
his
own
temple
and
sunium
the
promontory
of
athens
and
the
tall
oaks
wherefore
for
indeed
an
oak
does
not
commit
perjury
strep
i
do
not
know
but
you
seem
to
speak
well
for
what
pray
is
the
thunderbolt
soc
when
a
dry
wind
having
been
raised
aloft
is
inclosed
in
these
clouds
it
inflates
them
within
like
a
bladder
and
then
of
necessity
having
burst
them
it
rushes
out
with
vehemence
by
reason
of
its
density
setting
fire
to
itself
through
its
rushing
and
impetuosity
strep
by
jupiter
of
a
truth
i
once
experienced
this
exactly
at
the
diasian
festival
i
was
roasting
a
haggis
for
my
kinsfolk
and
through
neglect
i
did
not
cut
it
open
but
it
became
inflated
and
then
suddenly
bursting
befouled
my
eyes
and
burned
my
face
cho
o
mortal
who
hast
desired
great
wisdom
from
us
how
happy
will
you
become
among
the
athenians
and
among
the
greeks
if
you
be
possessed
of
a
good
memory
and
be
a
deep
thinker
and
endurance
of
labour
be
implanted
in
your
soul
and
you
be
not
wearied
either
by
standing
or
walking
nor
be
exceedingly
vexed
at
shivering
with
cold
nor
long
to
break
your
fast
and
you
refrain
from
wine
and
gymnastics
and
the
other
follies
and
consider
this
the
highest
excellence
as
is
proper
a
clever
man
should
to
conquer
by
action
and
counsel
and
by
battling
with
your
tongue
strep
as
far
as
regards
a
sturdy
spirit
and
care
that
makes
one
bed
uneasy
and
a
frugal
spirit
and
and
belly
be
of
good
courage
and
do
trouble
yourself
i
would
offer
myself
to
hammer
on
for
that
matter
soc
will
you
not
pray
now
believe
in
no
god
except
what
we
believe
in
this
chaos
and
the
clouds
and
the
tongue
these
three
strep
absolutely
i
would
not
even
converse
with
the
others
not
even
if
i
met
them
nor
would
i
sacrifice
to
them
nor
make
libations
nor
offer
frankincense
cho
tell
us
then
boldly
what
we
must
do
for
you
for
you
shall
not
fail
in
getting
it
if
you
honour
and
admire
us
and
seek
to
become
clever
strep
o
mistresses
i
request
of
you
then
this
very
small
favour
that
i
be
the
best
of
the
greeks
in
speaking
by
a
hundred
stadia
cho
well
you
shall
have
this
from
us
so
that
from
this
time
no
one
shall
get
more
opinions
passed
in
the
public
assemblies
than
you
strep
grant
me
not
to
deliver
important
opinions
for
i
do
not
desire
these
but
only
to
pervert
the
right
for
my
own
advantage
and
to
evade
my
creditors
cho
then
you
shall
obtain
what
you
desire
for
you
do
not
covet
great
things
but
commit
yourself
without
fear
to
our
ministers
strep
i
will
do
so
in
reliance
upon
you
for
necessity
oppresses
me
on
account
of
the
and
the
marriage
that
ruined
me
now
therefore
let
them
use
me
as
they
please
i
give
up
this
body
to
them
to
be
beaten
to
be
hungered
to
be
troubled
with
thirst
to
be
squalid
to
shiver
with
cold
to
flay
into
a
leathern
bottle
if
i
shall
escape
clear
from
my
debts
and
appear
to
men
to
be
bold
glib
of
tongue
audacious
impudent
shameless
a
fabricator
of
falsehoods
inventive
of
words
a
practiced
knave
in
lawsuits

a
thorough
rattle
a
fox

sharper

slippery
knave
a
dissembler
a
slippery
fellow
an
impostor
a
a
blackguard
a
twister
a
troublesome
fellow
a
of
hashes
if
they
call
me
this
when
they
meet
me
let
them
do
to
me
absolutely
what
they
please
and
if
they
like
by
ceres
let
them
serve
up
a
sausage
out
of
me
to
the
deep
thinkers
cho
this
man
has
a
spirit
not
void
of
courage
but
prompt
know
that
if
you
learn
these
matters
from
me
you
will
possess
among
mortals
a
glory
as
high
as
heaven
strep
what
shall
i
experience
cho
you
shall
pass
with
me
the
most
enviable
of
mortal
lives
the
whole
time
strep
shall
i
then
ever
see
this
cho
yea
so
that
many
be
always
seated
at
your
gates
wishing
to
communicate
with
you
and
come
to
a
conference
with
you
to
consult
with
you
as
to
actions
and
affidavits
of
many
talents
as
is
worthy
of
your
abilities
to
socrates
but
attempt
to
teach
the
old
man
by
degrees
whatever
you
purpose
and
scrutinize
his
intellect
and
make
trial
of
his
mind
soc
come
now
tell
me
your
own
turn
of
mind
in
order
that
when
i
know
of
what
sort
it
is
i
may
now
after
this
apply
to
you
new
engines
strep
what
by
the
gods
do
you
purpose
to
besiege
me
soc
no
i
wish
to
briefly
learn
from
you
if
you
are
possessed
of
a
good
memory
strep
in
two
ways
by
jove
if
anything
be
owing
to
me
i
have
a
very
good
memory
but
if
i
owe
unhappy
man
i
am
very
forgetful
soc
is
the
power
of
speaking
pray
implanted
in
your
nature
strep
speaking
is
not
in
me
but
cheating
is
soc
how
then
will
you
be
able
to
learn
strep
excellently
of
course
soc
come
then
take
care
that
whenever
i
propound
any
clever
dogma
about
abstruse
matters
you
catch
it
up
immediately
strep
what
then
am
i
to
feed
upon
wisdom
like
a
dog
soc
this
man
is
ignorant
and
brutish
i
fear
old
man
lest
you
will
need
blows
come
let
me
see
what
do
you
do
if
any
one
beat
you
strep
i
take
the
beating
and
then
when
i
have
waited
a
little
while
i
call
witnesses
to
prove
it
then
again
after
a
short
interval
i
go
to
law
soc
come
then
lay
down
your
cloak
strep
have
i
done
any
wrong
soc
no
but
it
is
the
rule
to
enter
naked
strep
but
i
do
not
enter
to
search
for
stolen
goods
soc
lay
it
down
why
do
you
talk
nonsense
strep
now
tell
me
this
pray
if
i
be
diligent
and
learn
zealously
to
which
of
your
disciples
shall
i
become
like
soc
you
will
no
way
differ
from
chaerephon
in
intellect
strep
ah
me
unhappy
i
shall
become
soc
do
chatter
but
quickly
follow
me
hither
with
smartness
strep
then
give
me
first
into
my
hands
a
honeyed
cake
for
i
am
afraid
of
descending
within
as
if
into
the
cave
of
trophonius
soc
proceed
why
do
you
keep
poking
about
the
door
exeunt
socrates
and
strepsiades
cho
well
go
in
peace
for
the
sake
of
this
your
valour
may
prosperity
attend
the
man
because
being
advanced
into
the
vale
of
years
he
imbues
his
intellect
with
modern
subjects
and
cultivates
wisdom
turning
to
the
audience
spectators
i
will
freely
declare
to
you
the
truth
by
bacchus
who
nurtured
me
so
may
i
conquer
and
be
accounted
skillful
as
that
deeming
you
to
be
clever
spectators
and
this
to
be
the
cleverest
of
my
comedies
i
thought
proper
to
let
you
first
taste
that
comedy
which
gave
me
the
greatest
labour
and
then
i
retired
from
the
contest
defeated
by
vulgar
fellows
though
i
did
not
deserve
it
these
things
therefore
i
object
to
you
a
learned
audience
for
whose
sake
i
was
expending
this
labour
but
not
even
thus
will
i
ever
willingly
desert
the
discerning
portion
of
you
for
since
what
time
my
modest
man
and
my
rake
were
very
highly
praised
here
by
an
audience
with
whom
it
is
a
pleasure
even
to
hold
converse
and
i
for
i
was
still
a
virgin
and
it
was
not
lawful
for
me
as
yet
to
have
children
exposed
my
offspring
and
another
girl
took
it
up
and
owned
it
and
you
generously
reared
and
educated
it
from
this
time
i
have
had
sure
pledges
of
your
good
will
toward
me
now
therefore
like
that
electra
has
this
comedy
come
seeking
if
haply
it
meet
with
an
audience
so
clever
for
it
will
recognize
if
it
should
see
the
lock
of
its
brother
but
see
how
modest
she
is
by
nature
who
in
the
first
place
has
come
having
stitched
to
her
no
leathern
phallus
hanging
down
red
at
the
top
and
thick
to
set
the
boys
a
laughing
nor
yet
jeered
the
nor
danced
the
cordax
nor
does
the
old
man
who
speaks
the
verses
beat
the
person
near
him
with
his
staff
keeping
out
of
sight
wretched
ribaldry
nor
has
she
rushed
in
with
torches
nor
does
she
shout
iou
iou
but
has
come
relying
on
herself
and
her
verses
and
i
although
so
excellent
a
poet
do
not
give
myself
airs
nor
do
i
seek
to
deceive
you
by
twice
and
thrice
bringing
forward
the
same
pieces
but
i
am
always
clever
at
introducing
new
fashions
not
at
all
resembling
each
other
and
all
of
them
clever
who
struck
cleon
in
the
belly
when
at
the
height
of
his
power
and
could
not
bear
to
attack
him
afterward
when
he
was
down
but
these
scribblers
when
once
hyperbolus
has
given
them
a
handle
keep
ever
trampling
on
this
wretched
man
and
his
mother
eupolis
indeed
first
of
all
craftily
introduced
his
maricas
having
basely
base
fellow
spoiled
by
altering
my
play
of
the
knights
having
added
to
it
for
the
sake
of
the
cordax
a
drunken
old
woman
whom
phrynichus
long
ago
poetized
whom
the
whale
was
for
devouring
then
again
hermippus
made
verses
on
hyperbolus
and
now
all
others
press
hard
upon
hyperbolus
imitating
my
simile
of
the
eels
whoever
therefore
laughs
at
these
let
him
not
take
pleasure
in
my
attempts
but
if
you
are
delighted
with
me
and
my
inventions
in
times
to
come
you
will
seem
to
be
wise
i
first
invoke
to
join
our
choral
band
the
mighty
jupiter
ruling
on
high
the
monarch
of
gods
and
the
potent
master
of
the
trident
the
fierce
upheaver
of
earth
and
briny
sea
and
our
father
of
great
renown
most
august
aether
of
all
and
the
who
fills
the
plain
of
the
earth
with
exceeding
bright
beams
a
mighty
deity
among
gods
and
mortals
most
clever
spectators
come
give
us
your
attention
for
having
been
injured
we
blame
you
to
your
faces
for
though
we
benefit
the
state
most
of
all
the
gods
to
us
alone
of
the
deities
you
do
not
offer
sacrifice
nor
yet
pour
libations
who
watch
over
you
for
if
there
should
be
any
expedition
without
prudence
then
we
either
thunder
or
drizzle
small
rain
and
then
when
you
were
for
choosing
as
your
general
the
paphlagonian
tanner
hateful
to
the
gods
we
contracted
our
brows
and
were
enraged
and
thunder
burst
through
the
lightning
and
the
moon
forsook
her
usual
paths
and
the
sun
immediately
drew
in
his
wick
to
himself
and
declared
he
would
not
give
you
light
if
cleon
should
be
your
general
nevertheless
you
chose
him
for
they
say
that
ill
counsel
is
in
this
city
that
the
gods
however
turn
all
these
your
mismanagements
to
a
prosperous
issue
and
how
this
also
shall
be
advantageous
we
will
easily
teach
you
if
you
should
convict
the
cormorant
cleon
of
bribery
and
embezzlement
and
then
make
fast
his
neck
in
the
stocks
the
affair
will
turn
out
for
the
state
to
the
ancient
form
again
if
you
have
mismanaged
in
any
way
and
to
a
prosperous
issue
hear
me
again
king
phoebus
delian
apollo
who
inhabitest
the
cynthian
rock
and
thou
blessed
goddess
who
inhabitest
the
house
of
ephesus
in
which
lydian
damsels
greatly
reverence
thee
and
thou
our
national
goddess
swayer
of
the
aegis
minerva
guardian
of
the
city
and
thou
reveler
bacchus
who
inhabiting
the
parnassian
rock
sparklest
with
torches
conspicuous
among
the
delphic
bacchanals
when
we
had
got
ready
to
set
out
hither
the
moon
met
us
and
commanded
us
first
to
greet
the
athenians
and
their
allies
and
then
declared
that
she
was
angry
for
that
she
had
suffered
dreadful
things
though
she
benefits
you
all
not
in
words
but
openly
in
the
first
place
not
less
than
a
drachma
every
month
for
torches
so
that
also
all
when
they
went
out
of
an
evening
were
wont
to
say
boy
do
buy
a
torch
for
the
moonlight
is
beautiful
and
she
says
she
confers
other
benefits
on
you
but
that
you
do
not
observe
the
days
at
all
correctly
but
confuse
them
up
and
down
so
that
she
says
the
gods
are
constantly
threatening
her
when
they
are
defrauded
of
their
dinner
and
depart
home
not
having
met
with
the
regular
feast
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
and
then
when
you
ought
to
be
sacrificing
you
are
inflicting
tortures
and
litigating
and
often
while
we
gods
are
observing
a
fast
when
we
mourn
for
memnon
or
sarpedon
you
are
pouring
libations
and
laughing
for
which
reason
hyperbolus
having
obtained
the
lot
this
year
to
be
hieromnemon
was
afterward
deprived
by
us
gods
of
his
crown
for
thus
he
will
know
better
that
he
ought
to
spend
the
days
of
his
life
according
to
the
moon
enter
socrates
soc
by
respiration
and
chaos
and
air
i
have
not
seen
any
man
so
boorish
nor
so
impracticable
nor
so
stupid
nor
so
forgetful
who
while
learning
some
little
petty
quibbles
forgets
them
before
he
has
learned
them
nevertheless
i
will
certainly
call
him
out
here
to
the
light
where
is
strepsiades
come
forth
with
your
couch
strep
from
within
the
bugs
do
not
permit
me
to
bring
it
forth
soc
make
haste
and
lay
it
down
and
give
me
your
attention
enter
strepsiades
strep
very
well
soc
come
now
what
do
you
now
wish
to
learn
first
of
those
things
in
none
of
which
you
have
ever
been
instructed
tell
me
about
measures
or
rhythms
or
verses
strep
i
should
prefer
to
learn
about
measures
for
it
is
but
lately
i
was
cheated
out
of
two
choenices
by
a
soc
i
do
not
ask
you
this
but
which
you
account
the
most
beautiful
measure
the
trimetre
or
the
tetrameter
strep
make
a
wager
then
with
me
if
the
semisextarius
be
not
a
tetrameter
soc
go
to
the
devil
how
boorish
you
are
and
dull
of
learning
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
learn
about
rhythms
strep
but
what
good
will
rhythms
do
me
for
a
living
soc
in
the
first
place
to
be
clever
at
an
entertainment
understanding
what
rhythm
is
for
the
and
what
again
according
to
the
dactyle
strep
according
to
the
dactyle
by
jove
but
i
know
it
soc
tell
me
pray
strep
what
else
but
this
finger
formerly
indeed
when
i
was
yet
a
boy
this
here
soc
you
are
boorish
and
stupid
strep
for
i
do
not
desire
you
wretch
to
learn
any
of
these
things
soc
what
then
strep
that
that
the
most
unjust
cause
soc
but
you
must
learn
other
things
before
these
namely
what
quadrupeds
are
properly
masculine
strep
i
know
the
males
if
i
am
not
tragos
tauros
kuon
alektryon
soc
do
you
see
what
you
are
doing
you
are
calling
both
the
female
and
the
male
alektryon
in
the
same
way
strep
how
pray
come
tell
me
soc
how
the
one
with
you
is
alektryon
and
the
other
is
alektryon
also
strep
yea
by
neptune
how
now
ought
i
to
call
them
soc
the
one
alektryaina
and
the
other
alektor
strep
alektryaina
capital
by
the
air
so
that
in
return
for
this
lesson
alone
i
will
fill
your
kardopos
full
of
on
all
sides
soc
see
see
there
again
is
another
blunder
you
make
kardopos
which
is
feminine
to
be
masculine
strep
in
what
way
do
i
make
kardopos
masculine
soc
most
assuredly
just
as
if
you
were
to
say
cleonymos
strep
good
sir
cleonymus
had
no
but
kneaded
his
bread
in
a
round
mortar
how
ought
i
to
call
it
henceforth
soc
how
call
it
kardope
as
you
call
sostrate
strep
kardope
in
the
feminine
soc
for
so
you
speak
it
rightly
strep
but
that
would
make
it
kardope
kleonyme
soc
you
must
learn
one
thing
more
about
names
what
are
masculine
and
what
of
them
are
feminine
strep
i
know
what
are
female

lysilla
philinna
clitagora
demetria

what
names
are
masculine

thousands
philoxenus
melesias
amynias
soc
but
you
wretch
these
are
not
masculine
strep
are
they
not
males
with
you
soc
by
no
means
for
how
would
you
call
amynias
if
you
met
him
strep
how
would
i
call
thus
come
hither
come
hither
amynia

do
you
see
you
call
amynias
a
woman
strep
is
it
not
then
with
justice
who
does
not
serve
in
the
army
but
why
should
i
learn
these
things
that
we
all
know
soc
it
is
no
use
by
jupiter
having
reclined
yourself
down
here
strep
what
must
i
do
soc
think
out
some
of
your
own
affairs
strep
not
here
pray
i
beseech
you
but
if
i
must
suffer
me
to
excogitate
these
very
things
on
the
ground

no
other
way

up
and
down
while
strepsiades

in
my
right

you
not
quickly
cover
yourself
up
and
think
of
something
strep
about
what
for
do
you
tell
me
this
o
socrates
soc
do
you
yourself
first
find
out
and
state
what
you
wish
strep
you
have
heard
a
thousand
times
what
i
wish
about
the
interest
so
that
i
may
pay
no
one

wrap
yourself
up
and
having
given
your
mind
play
with
subtilty
revolve
your
affairs
by
little
and
little
rightly
distinguishing
and
examining
strep
ah
me
unhappy
man
soc
keep
quiet
and
if
you
be
puzzled
in
any
one
of
your
conceptions
leave
it
and
go
and
then
set
your
mind
in
motion
again
and
lock
it
up
strep
in
great
glee
o
dearest
little
socrates

what
old
man

have
got
a
device
for
cheating
them
of
the
interest

me
this
pray
if
i
were
to
purchase
a
thessalian
witch
and
draw
down

by
night
and
then
shut
it
up
as
if
it

a
mirror
in

round
and

this
do
you

lent
out
by
the
month

will
again
propose

you
another
clever
question

how
you
would
obliterate
it
strep
how
how

i
must
seek

revolve
your
thoughts
about
yourself
but
slack
away
your
mind
into
the
air
like
a
tied
with
a
thread
by
the
foot
strep
i
have
found
a
very
clever
method
of
getting
rid
of
my
suit
so
that
you
yourself
would
acknowledge
it
soc
of
what
description
strep
have
you
ever
seen
this
stone
in
the
shops

beautiful
and
transparent
one
from
which
they
kindle
fire

do
you
mean
the
strep
i
do
come
what
would
you
say
pray
if
i
were
to
take
this
when
the
clerk
was
entering
the
suit
and
were
to
stand
at
a
distance
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
thus
and
melt
out
the
letters
of
my
suit
soc
cleverly
done
by
the
graces
strep
oh
how
i
am
delighted
that
a
suit
of
five
talents
has
been
cancelled
soc
come
now
quickly
seize
upon
this
strep
what
soc
how
when
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
you
could
overturn
the
suit
when
you
were
about
to
be
cast
because
you
had
no
witnesses
strep
most
readily
and
easily
soc
tell
me
pray
strep
well
now
i
tell
you
if
while
one
suit
was
still
pending
before
mine
was
called
on

were
to
run
away
and
hang
myself

bring
action
against
me
when

flour

you
while

what
folly
to
think
of
your
believing
in
jupiter
as
old
as
you
are
phid
why
pray
did
you
laugh
at
this
strep
reflecting
that
you
are
a
child
and
have
antiquated
notions
yet
however
approach
that
you
may
know
more
and
i
will
tell
you
a
thing
by
learning
which
you
will
be
a
man

see
that
you
do
not
teach
this
to
any
one
phid
well
what
is
it
strep
you
swore
now
by
jupiter
phid

melian
and
chaerephon
who
knows
the
footmarks

phid
have
you
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
frenzy
that
you
believe
madmen
strep
speak
words
of
good
omen
and
say
nothing
bad
of
clever
men
and
wise
of
whom
through
frugality
none
ever
shaved
or
anointed
himself
or
went
to
a
bath
to
wash
himself
while
you
squander
my
property
in
bathing
as
if
i
were
already
dead
but
go
as
quickly
as
possible
and
learn
instead
of
me
phid
what
good
could
any
one
learn
from
them
strep
what
really
whatever
wisdom
there
is
among
men
and
you
will
know
yourself
how
ignorant
and
stupid
you
are
but
wait
for
me
here
a
short
time
runs
off
phid
ah
me
what
shall
i
do
my
father
being
crazed
shall
i
bring
him
into
court
and
convict
him
of
lunacy
or
shall
i
give
information
of
his
madness
to
the
strepsiades
with
a
cock
under
one
arm
and
a
hen
under
the
other
strep
come
let
me
see
what
do
you
consider
this
to
be
tell
me
phid
alectryon
strep
right
and
what
this
phid
alectryon
strep
both
the
same
you
are
very
ridiculous
do
not
do
so
then
for
the
future
but
call
this
alektryaina
and
this
one
alektor
phid
alektryaina
did
you
learn
these
clever
things
by
going
in
just
now
to
the
titans
strep
and
many
others
too
but
whatever
i
learned
on
each
occasion
i
used
to
forget
immediately
through
length
of
years
phid
is
it
for
this
reason
pray
that
you
have
also
lost
your
cloak
strep
i
have
not
lost
it
but
have
studied
it
away
phid
what
have
you
made
of
your
slippers
you
foolish
man
strep
i
have
expended
them
like
pericles
for
needful
purposes
come
move
let
us
go
and
then
if
you
obey
your
father
go
wrong
if
you
like
i
also
know
that
i
formerly
obeyed
you
a
lisping
child
of
six
years
old
and
bought
you
a
at
the
diasia
with
the
first
obolus
i
received
from
the
heliaea
phid
you
will
assuredly
some
time
at
length
be
grieved
at
this
strep
it
is
well
done
of
you
that
you
obeyed
come
hither
come
hither
o
socrates
come
forth
for
i
bring
to
you
this
son
of
mine
having
persuaded
him
against
his
will
enter
socrates
soc
for
he
is
still
childish
and
not
used
to
the
baskets
here
phid
you
would
yourself
be
used
to
them
if
you
were
hanged
strep
a
mischief
take
you
do
you
abuse
your
teacher
soc
were
hanged
quoth
how
sillily
he
pronounced
it
and
with
lips
wide
apart
how
can
this
youth
ever
learn
an
acquittal
from
a
trial
or
a
legal
summons
or
persuasive
refutation
and
yet
hyperbolus
learned
this
at
the
cost
of
a
talent
strep
never
mind
teach
him
he
is
clever
by
nature
indeed
from
his
earliest
years
when
he
was
a
little
fellow
only
so
big
he
was
wont
to
form
houses
and
carve
ships
and
make
little
wagons
of
leather
and
make
frogs
out
of
you
ca
think
how
cleverly
but
see
that
he
learns
those
two
causes
the
better
whatever
it
may
be
and
the
worse
which
by
maintaining
what
is
unjust
overturns
the
better
if
not
both
at
any
rate
the
unjust
one
by
all
means
soc
he
shall
learn
it
himself
from
the
two
causes
in
person
exit
socrates
strep
i
will
take
my
departure
remember
this
now
that
he
is
to
be
able
to
reply
to
all
just
arguments
exit
strepsiades
and
enter
just
cause
and
unjust
cause
just
cause
come
hither
show
yourself
to
the
spectators
although
being
audacious
unjust
cause
go
whither
you
please
for
i
shall
far
rather
do
for
you
if
i
speak
before
a
crowd
just
you
destroy
me
who
are
you
unj
a
cause
just
ay
the
worse
unj
but
i
conquer
you
who
say
that
you
are
better
than
i
just
by
doing
what
clever
trick
unj
by
discovering
new
contrivances
just
for
these
innovations
flourish
by
the
favour
of
these
silly
persons
unj
no
but
wise
persons
just
i
will
destroy
you
miserably
unj
tell
me
by
doing
what
just
by
speaking
what
is
just
unj
but
i
will
overturn
them
by
contradicting
them
for
i
deny
that
justice
even
exists
at
all
just
do
you
deny
that
it
exists
unj
for
come
where
is
it
just
with
the
gods
unj
how
then
if
justice
exists
has
jupiter
not
perished
who
bound
his
own
father
just
bah
this
profanity
now
is
spreading
give
me
a
basin
unj
you
are
a
dotard
and
absurd
just
you
are
debauched
and
shameless
unj
you
have
spoken
roses
of
me
just
and
a
dirty
lickspittle
unj
you
crown
me
with
lilies
just
and
a
parricide
unj
you
do
know
that
you
are
sprinkling
me
with
gold
just
certainly
not
so
formerly
but
with
lead
unj
but
now
this
is
an
ornament
to
me
just
you
are
very
impudent
unj
and
you
are
antiquated
just
and
through
you
no
one
of
our
youths
is
willing
to
go
to
school
and
you
will
be
found
out
some
time
or
other
by
the
athenians
what
sort
of
doctrines
you
teach
the
unj
you
are
shamefully
squalid
just
and
you
are
prosperous
and
yet
formerly
you
were
a
beggar
saying
that
you
were
the
mysian
telephus
and
gnawing
the
maxims
of
pandeletus
out
of
your
little
wallet
unj
oh
the
wisdom
just
oh
the
madness
unj
which
you
have
mentioned
just
and
of
your
city
which
supports
you
who
ruin
her
youths
unj
you
sha
teach
this
youth
you
old
dotard
just
yes
if
he
is
to
be
saved
and
not
merely
to
practise
loquacity
unj
to
phidippides
come
hither
and
leave
him
to
rave
just
you
shall
howl
if
you
lay
your
hand
on
him
cho
cease
from
contention
and
railing
but
show
to
us
you
what
you
used
to
teach
the
men
of
former
times
and
you
the
new
system
of
education
in
order
that
having
heard
you
disputing
he
may
decide
and
go
to
the
school
of
one
or
the
other
just
i
am
willing
to
do
so
unj
i
also
am
willing
cho
come
now
which
of
the
two
shall
speak
first
unj
i
will
give
him
the
precedence
and
then
from
these
things
which
he
adduces
i
will
shoot
him
dead
with
new
words
and
thoughts
and
at
last
if
he
mutter
he
shall
be
destroyed
being
stung
in
his
whole
face
and
his
two
eyes
by
my
maxims
as
if
by
bees
cho
now
the
two
relying
on
very
dexterous
arguments
and
thoughts
and
sententious
maxims
will
show
which
of
them
shall
appear
superior
in
argument
for
now
the
whole
crisis
of
wisdom
is
here
laid
before
them
about
which
my
friends
have
a
very
great
contest
but
do
you
who
adorned
our
elders
with
many
virtuous
manners
utter
the
voice
in
which
you
rejoice
and
declare
your
nature
just
i
will
therefore
describe
the
ancient
system
of
education
how
it
was
ordered
when
i
flourished
in
the
advocacy
of
justice
and
temperance
was
the
fashion
in
the
first
place
it
was
incumbent
that
no
one
should
hear
the
voice
of
a
boy
uttering
a
syllable
and
next
that
those
from
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
should
march
in
good
order
through
the
streets
to
the
school
of
the
naked
and
in
a
body
even
if
it
were
to
snow
as
thick
as
meal
then
again
their
master
would
teach
them
not
sitting
to
learn
by
rote
a
song
either
pallada
persepolin
deinan
or
teleporon
ti
boama
raising
to
a
higher
pitch
the
harmony
which
our
fathers
transmitted
to
us
but
if
any
of
them
were
to
play
the
buffoon
or
to
turn
any
quavers
like
these
difficult
turns
the
present
artists
make
after
the
manner
of
phrynis
he
used
to
be
thrashed
being
beaten
with
many
blows
as
banishing
the
muses
and
it
behooved
the
boys
while
sitting
in
the
school
of
the
to
cover
the
thigh
so
that
they
might
exhibit
nothing
indecent
to
those
outside
then
again
after
rising
from
the
ground
to
sweep
the
sand
together
and
to
take
care
not
to
leave
an
impression
of
the
person
for
their
lovers
and
no
boy
used
in
those
days
to
anoint
himself
below
the
navel
so
that
their
bodies
wore
the
appearance
of
blooming
health
nor
used
he
to
go
to
his
lover
having
made
up
his
voice
in
an
effeminate
tone
prostituting
himself
with
his
eyes
nor
used
it
to
be
allowed
when
one
was
dining
to
take
the
head
of
the
radish
or
to
snatch
from
their
seniors
dill
or
parsley
or
to
eat
fish
or
to
giggle
or
to
keep
the
legs
crossed
unj
aye
antiquated
and
and
full
of
grasshoppers
and
of
cecydes
and
of
the
buphonian
festival
just
yet
certainly
these
are
those
principles
by
which
my
system
of
education
nurtured
the
men
who
fought
at
marathon
but
you
teach
the
men
of
the
present
day
so
that
i
am
choked
when
at
the
panathenaia
a
fellow
holding
his
shield
before
his
person
neglects
tritogenia
when
they
ought
to
dance
wherefore
o
youth
choose
with
confidence
me
the
better
cause
and
you
will
learn
to
hate
the
agora
and
to
refrain
from
baths
and
to
be
ashamed
of
what
is
disgraceful
and
to
be
enraged
if
any
one
jeer
you
and
to
rise
up
from
seats
before
your
seniors
when
they
approach
and
not
to
behave
ill
toward
your
parents
and
to
do
nothing
else
that
is
base
because
you
are
to
form
in
your
mind
an
image
of
modesty
and
not
to
dart
into
the
house
of
a
lest
while
gaping
after
these
things
being
struck
with
an
apple
by
a
wanton
you
should
be
damaged
in
your
reputation
and
not
to
contradict
your
father
in
anything
nor
by
calling
him
iapetus
to
reproach
him
with
the
ills
of
age
by
which
you
were
reared
in
your
infancy
unj
if
you
shall
believe
him
in
this
o
youth
by
bacchus
you
will
be
like
the
sons
of
hippocrates
and
they
will
call
you
a
booby
just
yet
certainly
shall
you
spend
your
time
in
the
gymnastic
schools
sleek
and
blooming
not
chattering
in
the
rude
jests
like
the
youths
of
the
present
day
nor
dragged
into
court
for
a
petty
suit
greedy
pettifogging
knavish
but
you
shall
descend
to
the
academy
and
run
races
beneath
the
sacred
olives
along
with
some
modest
compeer
crowned
with
white
reeds
redolent
of
yew
and
careless
ease
of
white
poplar
rejoicing
in
the
season
of
spring
when
the
whispers
to
the
elm
if
you
do
these
things
which
i
say
and
apply
your
mind
to
these
you
will
ever
have
a
stout
chest
a
clear
complexion
broad
shoulders
a
little
tongue
large
hips
little
lewdness
but
if
you
practise
what
the
youths
of
the
present
day
do
you
will
have
in
the
first
place
a
pallid
complexion
small
shoulders
a
narrow
chest
a
large
tongue
little
hips
great
lewdness
a
long
psephism
and
this
deceiver
will
persuade
you
to
consider
everything
that
is
base
to
be
honourable
and
what
is
honourable
to
be
base
and
in
addition
to
this
he
will
fill
you
with
the
lewdness
of
antimachus
cho
o
thou
that
practisest
most
renowned
wisdom
how
sweetly
does
a
modest
grace
attend
your
words
happy
therefore
were
they
who
lived
in
those
days
in
the
times
of
former
men
in
reply
then
to
these
o
thou
that
hast
a
muse
it
behooveth
thee
to
say
something
new
since
the
man
has
gained
renown
and
it
appears
you
have
need
of
powerful
arguments
against
him
if
you
are
to
conquer
the
man
and
not
incur
laughter
unj
and
yet
i
was
choking
in
my
heart
and
was
longing
to
confound
all
these
with
contrary
maxims
for
i
have
been
called
among
the
deep
thinkers
the
worse
cause
on
this
very
account
that
i
first
contrived
how
to
speak
against
both
law
and
justice
and
this
art
is
worth
more
than
ten
thousand
staters
that
one
should
choose
the
worse
cause
and
nevertheless
be
victorious
but
mark
how
i
will
confute
the
system
of
education
on
which
he
relies
who
says
in
the
first
place
that
he
will
not
permit
you
to
be
washed
with
warm
water
and
yet
on
what
principle
do
you
blame
the
warm
baths
just
because
it
is
most
vile
and
makes
a
man
cowardly
unj
stop
for
immediately
i
seize
and
hold
you
by
the
waist
without
escape
come
tell
me
which
of
the
sons
of
jupiter
do
you
deem
to
have
been
the
bravest
in
soul
and
to
have
undergone
most
labours
just
i
consider
no
man
superior
to
hercules
unj
where
pray
did
you
ever
see
cold
herculean
baths
and
yet
who
was
more
valiant
than
he
just
these
are
the
very
things
which
make
the
bath
full
of
youths
always
chattering
all
day
long
but
the
palaestras
empty
unj
you
next
find
fault
with
their
living
in
the
but
i
commend
it
for
if
it
had
been
bad
homer
would
never
have
been
for
representing
nestor
as
an
orator
nor
all
the
other
wise
men
i
will
return
then
from
thence
to
the
tongue
which
this
fellow
says
our
youths
ought
not
to
exercise
while
i
maintain
they
should
and
again
he
says
they
ought
to
be
modest
two
very
great
evils
for
tell
me
to
whom
you
have
ever
seen
any
good
accrue
through
modesty
and
confute
me
by
your
words
just
to
many
peleus
at
any
rate
received
his
sword
on
account
of
it
unj
a
sword
marry
he
got
a
pretty
piece
of
luck
the
poor
wretch
while
hyperbolus
he
of
the
lamps
got
more
than
many
talents
by
his
villainy
but
by
jupiter
no
sword
just
and
peleus
married
thetis
too
through
his
modesty
unj
and
then
she
went
off
and
left
him
for
he
was
not
lustful
nor
an
agreeable
bedfellow
to
spend
the
night
with
now
a
woman
delights
in
being
wantonly
treated
but
you
are
an
old
dotard
for
to
phidippides
consider
o
youth
all
that
attaches
to
modesty
and
of
how
many
pleasures
you
are
about
to
be
deprived
of
women
of
games
at
cottabus
of
dainties
of
of
giggling
and
yet
what
is
life
worth
to
you
if
you
be
deprived
of
these
enjoyments
well
i
will
pass
from
thence
to
the
necessities
of
our
nature
you
have
gone
astray
you
have
fallen
in
love
you
have
been
guilty
of
some
adultery
and
then
have
been
caught
you
are
undone
for
you
are
unable
to
speak
but
if
you
associate
with
me
indulge
your
inclination
dance
laugh
and
think
nothing
disgraceful
for
if
you
should
happen
to
be
detected
as
an
adulterer
you
will
make
this
reply
to
him
that
you
have
done
him
no
injury
and
then
refer
him
to
jupiter
how
even
he
is
overcome
by
love
and
women
and
yet
how
could
you
who
are
a
mortal
have
greater
power
than
a
god
just
but
what
if
he
should
suffer
the
radish
through
obeying
you
and
be
depillated
with
hot
ashes
what
argument
will
he
be
able
to
state
to
prove
that
he
is
not
a
blackguard
unj
and
if
he
be
a
blackguard
what
harm
will
he
suffer
just
nay
what
could
he
ever
suffer
still
greater
than
this
unj
what
then
will
you
say
if
you
be
conquered
by
me
in
this
just
i
will
be
silent
what
else
can
i
do
unj
come
now
tell
me
from
what
class
do
the
advocates
come
just
from
the
blackguards
unj
i
believe
you
what
then
from
what
class
do
tragedians
come
just
from
the
blackguards
unj
you
say
well
but
from
what
class
do
the
public
orators
come
just
from
the
blackguards
unj
then
have
you
perceived
that
you
say
nothing
to
the
purpose
and
look
which
class
among
the
audience
is
the
more
numerous
just
well
now
i
looking
unj
what
then
do
you
see
just
by
the
gods
the
blackguards
to
be
far
more
numerous
this
fellow
at
any
rate
i
know
and
him
yonder
and
this
fellow
with
the
long
hair
unj
what
then
will
you
say
just
we
are
conquered
ye
blackguards
by
the
gods
receive
my
cloak
for
i
desert
to
you
exeunt
the
two
causes
and
socrates
and
strepsiades
soc
what
then
whether
do
you
wish
to
take
and
lead
away
this
your
son
or
shall
i
teach
him
to
speak
strep
teach
him
and
chastise
him
and
remember
that
you
train
him
properly
on
the
one
side
able
for
petty
suits
but
train
his
other
jaw
able
for
the
more
important
causes
soc
make
yourself
easy
you
shall
receive
him
back
a
clever
sophist
strep
nay
rather
pale
and
wretched
exeunt
socrates
strepsiades
and
phidippides
cho
go
ye
then
but
i
think
that
you
will
repent
of
these
proceedings
we
wish
to
speak
about
the
judges
what
they
will
gain
if
at
all
they
justly
assist
this
chorus
for
in
the
first
place
if
you
wish
to
plough
up
your
fields
in
spring
we
will
rain
for
you
first
but
for
the
others
afterward
and
then
we
will
protect
the
fruits
and
the
vines
so
that
neither
drought
afflict
them
nor
excessive
wet
weather
but
if
any
mortal
dishonour
us
who
are
goddesses
let
him
consider
what
evils
he
will
suffer
at
our
hands
obtaining
neither
wine
nor
anything
else
from
his
farm
for
when
his
olives
and
vines
sprout
they
shall
be
cut
down
with
such
slings
will
we
smite
them
and
if
we
see
him
making
brick
we
will
rain
and
we
will
smash
the
tiles
of
his
roof
with
round
hailstones
and
if
he
himself
or
any
one
of
his
kindred
or
friends
at
any
time
marry
we
will
rain
the
whole
night
so
he
will
probably
wish
rather
to
have
been
even
in
egypt
than
to
have
judged
badly
enter
strepsiades
with
a
on
his
shoulder
strep
the
fifth
the
fourth
the
third
after
this
the
second
and
then
of
all
the
days
i
most
fear
and
dread
and
abominate
immediately
after
this
there
is
the
old
and
new
for
every
one
to
whom
i
happen
to
be
indebted
swears
and
says
he
will
ruin
and
destroy
me
having
made
his
deposits
against
me
though
i
only
ask
what
is
moderate
and
my
good
sir
one
part
take
just
now
the
other
part
put
off
i
pray
and
the
other
part
remit
they
say
that
thus
they
will
never
get
back
their
money
but
abuse
me
as
i
am
unjust
and
say
they
will
go
to
law
with
me
now
therefore
let
them
go
to
law
for
it
little
concerns
me
if
phidippides
has
learned
to
speak
well
i
shall
soon
know
by
knocking
at
the
knocks
at
the
door

good
morning

the
same
to

this
present
for
one
ought
to
compliment
the
teacher
with
a
fee
and
tell
me
about
my
son
if
he
has
learned
that
cause
which
you
just
now
brought
forward
soc
he
has
learned
it
strep
well
done
o
fraud
queen
soc
so
that
you
can
get
clear
off
from
whatever
suit
you
please
strep
even
if
witnesses
were
present
when
i
borrowed
the
money
soc
yea
much
more
even
if
a
thousand
be
present
strep
then
i
will
shout
with
a
very
loud
shout
ho
weep
you
both
you
and
your
principals
and
your
compound
interests
for
you
can
no
longer
do
me
any
harm
because
such
a
son
is
being
reared
for
me
in
this
house
shining
with
a
tongue
for
my
guardian
the
preserver
of
my
house
a
mischief
to
my
enemies
ending
the
sadness
of
the
great
woes
of
his
father
him
do
thou
run
and
summon
from
within
to
me
socrates
goes
into
the
house
o
child
o
son
come
forth
from
the
house
hear
your
father
socrates
leading
in
phidippides
soc
lo
here
is
the
man
strep
o
my
dear
my
dear
soc
take
your
son
and
depart
exit
socrates
strep
oh
oh
my
child
huzza
huzza
how
i
am
delighted
at
the
first
sight
of
your
complexion
now
indeed
you
are
in
the
first
place
negative
and
disputatious
to
look
at
and
this
fashion
native
to
the
place
plainly
appears
the
what
do
you
say
and
the
seeming
to
be
injured
when
i
well
know
you
are
injuring
and
inflicting
a
wrong
and
in
your
countenance
there
is
the
attic
look
now
therefore
see
that
you
save
me
since
you
have
also
ruined
me
phid
what
pray
do
you
fear
strep
the
old
and
new
phid
why
is
any
day
old
and
new
strep
yes
on
which
they
say
that
they
will
make
their
deposits
against
me
phid
then
those
that
have
made
them
will
lose
them
for
it
is
not
possible
that
two
days
can
be
one
day
strep
can
not
it
phid
certainly
not
unless
the
same
woman
can
be
both
old
and
young
at
the
same
time
strep
and
yet
it
is
the
law
phid
for
they
do
not
i
think
rightly
understand
what
the
law
means
strep
and
what
does
it
mean
phid
the
ancient
solon
was
by
nature
the
friend
strep
this
surely
is
nothing
whatever
to
the
old
and
new
phid
he
therefore
made
the
summons
for
two
days
for
the
old
and
new
that
the
deposits
might
be
made
on
the
first
of
the
month
strep
why
pray
did
he
add
the
old
day
phid
in
order
my
good
sir
that
the
defendants
being
present
a
day
before
might
compromise
the
matter
of
their
own
accord
but
if
not
that
they
might
be
worried
on
the
morning
of
the
new
moon
strep
why
then
do
the
magistrates
not
receive
the
deposits
on
the
new
moon
but
on
the
old
and
new
phid
they
seem
to
me
to
do
what
the
forestallers
do
in
order
that
they
may
appreciate
the
deposits
as
soon
as
possible
on
this
account
they
have
the
first
pick
by
one
day
strep
turning
to
the
audience
bravo
ye
wretches
why
do
you
sit
senseless
the
gain
of
us
wise
men
being
blocks
ciphers
mere
sheep
jars
heaped
together
wherefore
i
must
sing
an
encomium
upon
myself
and
this
my
son
on
account
of
our
good
fortune
o
happy
strepsiades
how
wise
you
are
yourself
and
how
excellent
is
the
son
whom
you
are
rearing
my
friends
and
will
say
of
me
envying
me
when
you
prove
victorious
in
arguing
causes
but
first
i
wish
to
lead
you
in
and
entertain
you
exeunt
strepsiades
and
phidippides
pasias
entering
with
his
then
ought
a
man
to
throw
away
any
part
of
his
own
property
never
but
it
were
better
then
at
once
to
put
away
blushes
rather
than
now
to
have
trouble
since
i
am
now
dragging
you
to
be
a
witness
for
the
sake
of
my
own
money
and
further
in
addition
to
this
i
shall
become
an
enemy
to
my
but
never
while
i
live
will
i
disgrace
my
country
but
will
summon
strepsiades
strep
from
within
who
there
pas
for
the
old
and
new
strep
i
call
you
to
witness
that
he
has
named
it
for
two
days
for
what
matter
do
you
summon
me
pas
for
the
twelve
minae
which
you
received
when
you
were
buying
the
horse
strep
a
horse
do
you
not
hear
i
whom
you
all
know
to
hate
horsemanship
pas
and
by
jupiter
you
swore
by
the
gods
too
that
you
would
repay
it
strep
ay
by
jove
for
then
my
phidippides
did
not
yet
know
the
irrefragable
argument
pas
and
do
you
now
intend
on
this
account
to
deny
the
debt
strep
why
what
good
should
i
get
else
from
his
instruction
pas
and
will
you
be
willing
to
deny
these
upon
oath
of
the
gods
strep
what
gods
pas
jupiter
mercury
and
neptune
strep
yes
by
jupiter
and
would
pay
down
too
a
piece
besides
to
swear
pas
then
may
you
perish
some
day
for
your
impudence
strep
this
man
would
be
the
better
for
it
if
he
were
cleansed
by
rubbing
with
salt
pas
ah
me
how
you
deride
me
strep
he
will
contain
six
choae
pas
by
great
jupiter
and
the
gods
you
certainly
shall
not
do
this
to
me
with
impunity
strep
i
like
your
gods
amazingly
and
jupiter
sworn
by
is
ridiculous
to
the
knowing
ones
pas
you
will
assuredly
suffer
punishment
some
time
or
other
for
this
but
answer
and
dismiss
me
whether
you
are
going
to
repay
me
my
money
or

who
asks
me
for
his
money

me
what
is

pas
what
is
this
a
kardopos
strep
and
do
you
then
ask
me
for
your
money
being
such
an
ignorant
person
i
would
not
pay
not
even
an
obolus
to
any
one
who
called
the
kardope
kardopos
pas
then
wo
you
pay
me
strep

you
not
then
pack
off
as
fast
as
possible
from
my
door
pas
i
will
depart
and
be
assured
of
this
that
i
will
make
deposit
against
you
or
may
i
live
no
longer
strep
then
you
will
lose
it
besides
in
addition
to
your
twelve
minae
and
yet
i
do
not
wish
you
to
suffer
this
because
you
named
the
kardopos
foolishly
exeunt
pasias
and
witness
and
enter
amynias
amynias
ah
me
ah
me
strep
ha
whoever
is
this
who
is
lamenting
surely
it
was
not
one
of
carcinus
deities
that
spoke
amyn
but
why
do
you
wish
to
know
this
who
i
am
miserable
man
strep
then
follow
your
own
path
amyn
o
harsh
fortune
o
fates
breaking
the
wheels
of
my
horses
o
pallas
how
you
have
destroyed
me
strep
what
evil
pray
has
tlepolemus
ever
done
you
amyn
do
not
jeer
me
my
friend
but
order
your
son
to
pay
me
the
money
which
he
received
especially
as
i
have
been
unfortunate
strep
what
money
is
this
amyn
that
which
he
borrowed
strep
then
you
were
really
unlucky
as
i
think
amyn
by
the
gods
i
fell
while
driving
my
horses
strep
why
pray
do
you
talk
nonsense
as
if
you
had
fallen
from
an
ass
amyn
do
i
talk
nonsense
if
i
wish
to
recover
my
money
strep
you
ca
be
in
your
senses
yourself
amyn
why
pray
strep
you
appear
to
me
to
have
had
your
brains
shaken
as
it
were
amyn
and
you
appear
to
me
by
hermes
to
be
going
to
be
summoned
if
you
will
not
pay
me
the
money
strep
tell
me
now
whether
you
think
that
jupiter
always
rains
fresh
rain
on
each
occasion
or
that
the
sun
draws
from
below
the
same
water
back
again
amyn
i
know
not
which
nor
do
i
care
strep
how
then
is
it
just
that
you
should
recover
your
money
if
you
know
nothing
of
meteorological
matters
amyn
well
if
you
are
in
want
pay
me
the
interest
of
my
money
strep
what
sort
of
animal
is
this
interest
amyn
most
assuredly
the
money
is
always
becoming
more
and
more
every
month
and
every
day
as
the
time
slips
away
strep
you
say
well
what
then
is
it
possible
that
you
consider
the
sea
to
be
greater
now
than
formerly
amyn
no
by
jupiter
but
equal
for
it
is
not
fitting
that
it
should
be
greater
strep
and
how
then
you
wretch
does
this
become
no
way
greater
though
the
rivers
flow
into
it
while
you
seek
to
increase
your
money
will
you
not
take
yourself
off
from
my
house
bring
me
the
goad
enter
servant
with
a
goad
amyn
i
call
you
to
witness
these
things
strep
beating

go
why
do
you
delay
wo
you
march
amyn
is
not
this
an
insult
pray
strep
will
you
move

the
goad
i
lay
on
you
goading
you

i
thought
i
should
stir
you
together
with
your
wheels
and
your
chariots
exit
strepsiades
cho
what
a
thing
it
is
to
love
evil
courses
for
this
old
man
having
loved
them
wishes
to
withhold
the
money
that
he
borrowed
and
he
will
certainly
meet
with
something
today
which
will
perhaps
cause
this
sophist
to
suddenly
receive
some
misfortune
in
return
for
the
knaveries
he
has
begun
for
i
think
that
he
will
presently
find
what
has
been
long
boiling
up
that
his
son
is
skilful
to
speak
opinions
opposed
to
justice
so
as
to
overcome
all
with
whomsoever
he
holds
converse
even
if
he
advance
most
villainous
doctrines
and
perhaps
perhaps
his
father
will
wish
that
he
were
even
speechless
strep
running
out
of
the
house
pursued
by
his
son
hollo
hollo
o
neighbours
and
kinsfolk
and
defend
me
by
all
means
who
am
being
beaten
ah
me
unhappy
man
for
my
head
and
jaw
wretch
do
you
beat
your
father
phid
yes
father
strep
you
see
him
owning
that
he
beats
me
phid
certainly
strep
o
wretch
and
parricide
and
phid
say
the
same
things
of
me
again
and
more
do
you
know
that
i
take
pleasure
in
being
much
abused
strep
you
blackguard
phid
sprinkle
me
with
roses
in
abundance
strep
do
you
beat
your
father
phid
and
will
prove
too
by
jupiter
that
i
beat
you
with
justice
strep
o
thou
most
rascally
why
how
can
it
be
just
to
beat
a
father
phid
i
will
demonstrate
it
and
will
overcome
you
in
argument
strep
will
you
overcome
me
in
this
phid
yea
by
much
and
easily
but
choose
which
of
the
two
causes
you
wish
to
speak
strep
of
what
two
causes
phid
the
better
or
the
worse
strep
marry
i
did
get
you
taught
to
speak
against
justice
by
jupiter
my
friend
if
you
are
going
to
persuade
me
of
this
that
it
is
just
and
honourable
for
a
father
to
be
beaten
by
his
sons
phid
i
think
i
shall
certainly
persuade
you
so
that
when
you
have
heard
not
even
you
yourself
will
say
anything
against
it
strep
well
now
i
am
willing
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
cho
it
is
your
business
old
man
to
consider
in
what
way
you
shall
conquer
the
man
for
if
he
were
not
relying
upon
something
he
would
not
be
so
licentious
but
he
is
emboldened
by
something
the
boldness
of
the
man
is
evident
now
you
ought
to
tell
to
the
chorus
from
what
the
contention
first
arose
and
this
you
must
do
by
all
means
strep
well
now
i
will
tell
you
from
what
we
first
began
to
rail
at
one
another
after
we
had
feasted
as
you
know
i
first
bade
him
take
a
lyre
and
sing
a
song
of
simonides
the
shearing
of
the
ram
but
he
immediately
said
it
was
to
play
on
the
lyre
and
sing
while
drinking
like
a
woman
grinding
parched
barley
phid
for
ought
you
not
then
immediately
to
be
beaten
and
trampled
on
bidding
me
sing
just
as
if
you
were
entertaining
cicadae
strep
he
expressed
however
such
opinions
then
too
within
as
he
does
now
and
he
asserted
that
simonides
was
a
bad
poet
i
bore
it
at
first
with
difficulty
indeed
yet
nevertheless
i
bore
it
and
then
i
bade
him
at
least
take
a
and
recite
to
me
some
portion
of
aeschylus
and
then
he
immediately
said
shall
i
consider
aeschylus
the
first
among
the
poets
full
of
empty
sound
unpolished
bombastic
using
rugged
words
and
hereupon
you
ca
think
how
my
heart
panted
but
nevertheless
i
restrained
my
passion
and
said
at
least
recite
some
passage
of
the
more
modern
poets
of
whatever
kind
these
clever
things
be
and
he
immediately
sang
a
passage
of
euripides
how
a
brother
o
averter
of
ill
debauched
his
uterine
sister
and
i
bore
it
no
longer
but
immediately
assailed
him
with
many
abusive
reproaches
and
then
after
that
as
was
natural
we
hurled
word
upon
word
then
he
springs
upon
me
and
then
he
was
wounding
me
and
beating
me
and
throttling
me
phid
were
you
not
therefore
justly
beaten
who
do
not
praise
euripides
the
wisest
of
poets
strep
he
the
wisest
oh
what
shall
i
call
you
but
i
shall
be
beaten
again
phid
yes
by
jupiter
with
justice
strep
why
how
with
justice
who
o
shameless
fellow
reared
you
understanding
all
your
wishes
when
you
lisped
what
you
meant
if
you
said
bryn
i
understanding
it
used
to
give
you
to
drink
and
when
you
asked
for
mamman
i
used
to
come
to
you
with
bread
and
you
used
no
sooner
to
say
caccan
than
i
used
to
take
and
carry
you
out
of
doors
and
hold
you
before
me
but
you
now
throttling
me
who
was
bawling
and
crying
out
because
i
wanted
to
ease
myself
had
not
the
heart
to
carry
me
forth
out
of
doors
you
wretch
but
i
did
it
there
while
i
was
being
throttled
cho
i
fancy
the
hearts
of
the
youths
are
panting
to
hear
what
he
will
say
for
if
after
having
done
such
things
he
shall
persuade
him
by
speaking
i
would
not
take
the
hide
of
the
old
folks
even
at
the
price
of
a
it
is
thy
business
thou
author
and
upheaver
of
new
words
to
seek
some
means
of
persuasion
so
that
you
shall
seem
to
speak
justly
phid
how
pleasant
it
is
to
be
acquainted
with
new
and
clever
things
and
to
be
able
to
despise
the
established
laws
for
i
when
i
applied
my
mind
to
horsemanship
alone
used
not
to
be
able
to
utter
three
words
before
i
made
a
mistake
but
now
since
he
himself
has
made
me
cease
from
these
pursuits
and
i
am
acquainted
with
subtle
thoughts
and
arguments
and
speculations
i
think
i
shall
demonstrate
that
it
is
just
to
chastise
one
father
strep
ride
then
by
jupiter
since
it
is
better
for
me
to
keep
a
team
of
four
horses
than
to
be
killed
with
a
beating
phid
i
will
pass
over
to
that
part
of
my
discourse
where
you
interrupted
me
and
first
i
will
ask
you
this
did
you
beat
me
when
i
was
a
boy
strep
i
did
through
and
concern
for
you
phid
pray
tell
me
is
it
not
just
that
i
also
should
be
well
inclined
toward
you
in
the
same
way
and
beat
you
since
this
is
to
be
well
give
a
beating
for
why
ought
your
body
to
be
exempt
from
blows
and
mine
not
and
yet
i
too
was
born
free
the
boys
weep
and
do
you
not
think
it
is
right
that
a
father
should
weep
you
will
say
that
it
is
ordained
by
law
that
this
should
be
the
lot
of
boys
but
i
would
reply
that
old
men
are
boys
twice
over
and
that
it
is
the
more
reasonable
that
the
old
should
weep
than
the
young
inasmuch
as
it
is
less
just
that
they
should
err
strep
it
is
nowhere
ordained
by
law
that
a
father
should
suffer
this
phid
was
it
not
then
a
man
like
you
and
me
who
first
proposed
this
law
and
by
speaking
persuaded
the
ancients
why
then
is
it
less
lawful
for
me
also
in
turn
to
propose
henceforth
a
new
law
for
the
sons
that
they
should
beat
their
fathers
in
turn
but
as
many
blows
as
we
received
before
the
law
was
made
we
remit
and
we
concede
to
them
our
having
been
thrashed
without
return
observe
the
cocks
and
these
other
animals
how
they
punish
their
fathers
and
yet
in
what
do
they
differ
from
us
except
that
they
do
not
write
decrees
strep
why
then
since
you
imitate
the
cocks
in
all
things
do
you
not
both
eat
dung
and
sleep
on
a
perch
phid
it
is
not
the
same
thing
my
friend
nor
would
it
appear
so
to
socrates
strep
therefore
do
not
beat
me
otherwise
you
will
one
day
blame
yourself
phid
why
how
strep
since
i
am
justly
entitled
to
chastise
you
and
you
to
chastise
your
son
if
you
should
have
one
phid
but
if
i
should
not
have
one
i
shall
have
wept
for
nothing
and
you
will
die
laughing
at
me
strep
to
me
indeed
o
comrades
he
seems
to
speak
justly
and
i
think
we
ought
to
concede
to
them
what
is
fitting
for
it
is
proper
that
we
should
weep
if
we
do
not
act
justly
phid
consider
still
another
maxim
strep
no
for
i
shall
perish
if
i
do
phid
and
yet
perhaps
you
will
not
be
vexed
at
suffering
what
you
now
suffer
strep
how
pray
for
inform
me
what
good
you
will
do
me
by
this
phid
i
will
beat
my
mother
just
as
i
have
you
strep
what
do
you
say
what
do
you
say
this
other
again
is
a
greater
wickedness
phid
but
what
if
having
the
worst
cause
i
shall
conquer
you
in
arguing
proving
that
it
is
right
to
beat
one
mother
strep
most
assuredly
if
you
do
this
nothing
will
hinder
you
from
casting
yourself
and
your
worse
cause
into
the
pit
along
with
socrates
these
evils
have
i
suffered
through
you
o
clouds
having
intrusted
all
my
affairs
to
you
cho
nay
rather
you
are
yourself
the
cause
of
these
things
having
turned
yourself
to
wicked
courses
strep
why
pray
did
you
not
tell
me
this
then
but
excited
with
hopes
a
rustic
and
aged
man
cho
we
always
do
this
to
him
whom
we
perceive
to
be
a
lover
of
wicked
courses
until
we
precipitate
him
into
misfortune
so
that
he
may
learn
to
fear
the
gods
strep
ah
me
it
is
severe
o
clouds
but
it
is
just
for
i
ought
not
to
have
withheld
the
money
which
i
borrowed
now
therefore
come
with
me
my
dearest
son
that
you
may
destroy
the
blackguard
chaerephon
and
socrates
who
deceived
you
and
me
phid
i
will
not
injure
my
teachers
strep
yes
yes
reverence
paternal
jove
phid
paternal
jove
how
antiquated
you
are
why
is
there
any
jove
strep
there
is
phid
there
is
not
no
for
vortex
reigns
having
expelled
jupiter
strep
he
has
not
expelled
him
but
i
fancied
this
on
account
of
this
vortex
here
ah
me
unhappy
man
when
i
even
took
you
who
are
of
earthenware
for
a
god
phid
here
rave
and
babble
to
yourself
exit
phidippides
strep
ah
me
what
madness
how
mad
then
i
was
when
i
ejected
the
gods
on
account
of
socrates
but
o
dear
hermes
by
no
means
be
wroth
with
me
nor
destroy
me
but
pardon
me
since
i
have
gone
crazy
through
prating
and
become
my
adviser
whether
i
shall
bring
an
action
and
prosecute
them
or
whatever
you
think
you
advise
me
rightly
not
permitting
me
to
get
up
a
lawsuit
but
as
soon
as
possible
to
set
fire
to
the
house
of
the
prating

you
love
your
master
until
you
tumble
the
house
upon
them
xanthias

the
roof
but
let
some
one
bring
me
a
lighted
torch
and
i
make
some
of
them
this
day
suffer
punishment
even
if
they
be
ever
so
