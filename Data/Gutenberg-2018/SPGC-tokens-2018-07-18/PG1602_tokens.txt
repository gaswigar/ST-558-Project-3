chapter
i
the
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
are
pleasanter
than
being
sick
in
a
new
york
when
one
nearest
dearest
is
a
married
sister
up
in
michigan
some
one
must
have
been
very
kind
for
there
were
doctors
and
a
striped
nurse
and
bottles
and
things
there
was
even
a
vase
of
perky
carnations
scarlet
ones
i
discovered
that
they
had
a
trick
of
nodding
their
heads
saucily
the
discovery
did
not
appear
to
surprise
me
said
i
aloud
to
the
fattest
and
reddest
carnation
that
overtopped
all
the
rest
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
in
here
the
striped
nurse
i
had
noticed
her
before
rose
from
some
corner
and
came
swiftly
over
to
my
bedside
taking
my
wrist
between
her
fingers
i
very
well
thank
you
she
said
smiling
and
i
came
in
at
the
door
of
i
was
talking
to
you
i
snapped
crossly
i
was
speaking
to
the
carnations
particularly
to
that
elderly
one
at
the
top
the
fat
one
who
keeps
bowing
and
wagging
his
head
at
oh
yes
answered
the
striped
nurse
politely
of
course
that
one
is
very
lively
is
he
but
suppose
we
take
them
out
for
a
little
while
she
picked
up
the
vase
and
carried
it
into
the
corridor
and
the
carnations
nodded
their
heads
more
vigorously
than
ever
over
her
shoulder
i
heard
her
call
softly
to
some
one
the
some
one
answered
with
a
sharp
little
cry
that
sounded
like
conscious
the
next
moment
my
own
sister
norah
came
quietly
into
the
room
and
knelt
at
the
side
of
my
bed
and
took
me
in
her
arms
it
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
that
she
should
be
there
patting
me
with
reassuring
little
love
pats
murmuring
over
me
with
her
lips
against
my
check
calling
me
a
hundred
pet
names
that
i
had
not
heard
for
years
but
then
nothing
seemed
to
surprise
me
that
surprising
day
not
even
the
sight
of
a
great
scrubbed
looking
man
who
strolled
into
the
room
just
as
norah
was
in
the
midst
of
denouncing
newspapers
in
general
and
my
newspaper
in
particular
and
calling
the
city
editor
a
and
a
beast
the
big
man
stood
regarding
us
tolerantly
better
eh
said
he
not
as
one
who
asks
a
question
but
as
though
in
confirmation
of
a
thought
then
he
too
took
my
wrist
between
his
fingers
his
touch
was
very
firm
and
cool
after
that
he
pulled
down
my
eyelids
and
said
then
he
patted
my
cheek
smartly
once
or
twice
you
do
he
pronounced
he
picked
up
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
table
and
looked
it
over
there
followed
a
clinking
of
bottles
and
glasses
a
few
words
to
the
nurse
and
then
as
she
left
the
room
the
big
man
seated
himself
heavily
in
the
chair
near
the
bedside
and
rested
his
great
hands
on
his
fat
knees
he
stared
down
at
me
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
huge
mastiff
looks
at
a
terrier
finally
his
glance
rested
on
my
limp
left
hand
married
h
for
a
moment
the
word
would
not
come
i
could
hear
norah
catch
her
breath
quickly
then
yes
answered
i
husband
living
i
could
see
suspicion
dawning
in
his
cold
gray
eye
again
the
catch
in
norah
throat
and
a
little
half
warning
half
supplicating
gesture
and
again
yes
said
i
the
dawn
of
suspicion
burst
into
full
glow
where
is
he
growled
the
doctor
at
a
time
like
this
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
moment
too
sick
at
heart
to
resent
his
manner
i
could
feel
more
than
see
that
sis
was
signaling
him
frantically
i
moistened
my
lips
and
answered
him
bitterly
he
is
in
the
starkweather
hospital
for
the
when
the
man
spoke
again
the
growl
was
quite
gone
from
his
voice
and
your
home
is
where
nowhere
i
replied
meekly
from
my
pillow
but
at
that
sis
put
her
hand
out
quickly
as
though
she
had
been
struck
and
said
my
home
is
her
well
then
take
her
there
he
ordered
frowning
and
keep
her
there
as
long
as
you
can
newspaper
reporting
h
in
new
york
that
a
devil
of
a
job
for
a
woman
and
a
husband
who
well
you
have
to
take
a
six
months
course
in
loafing
young
woman
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
you
are
still
determined
to
work
ca
you
pick
out
something
easier
like
taking
in
scrubbing
for
instance
i
managed
a
feeble
smile
wishing
that
he
would
go
away
quickly
so
that
i
might
sleep
he
seemed
to
divine
my
thoughts
for
he
disappeared
into
the
corridor
taking
norah
with
him
their
voices
and
carefully
guarded
could
be
heard
as
they
conversed
outside
my
door
norah
was
telling
him
the
whole
miserable
business
i
wished
savagely
that
she
would
let
me
tell
it
if
it
must
be
told
how
could
she
paint
the
fascination
of
the
man
who
was
my
husband
she
had
never
known
the
charm
of
him
as
i
had
known
it
in
those
few
brief
months
before
our
marriage
she
had
never
felt
the
caress
of
his
voice
or
the
magnetism
of
his
strange
smoldering
eyes
glowing
across
the
city
room
as
i
had
felt
them
fixed
on
me
no
one
had
ever
known
what
he
had
meant
to
the
girl
of
twenty
with
her
brain
full
of
unspoken
dreams
dreams
which
were
all
to
become
glorious
realities
in
that
new
york
how
he
had
fired
my
imagination
he
had
been
the
most
brilliant
writer
on
the
big
brilliant
sheet
and
the
most
dissolute
how
my
heart
had
pounded
on
that
first
lonely
day
when
this
looked
up
from
his
desk
saw
me
and
strolled
over
to
where
i
sat
before
my
typewriter
he
smiled
down
at
me
companionably
i
quite
sure
that
my
mouth
must
have
been
wide
open
with
surprise
he
had
been
smoking
a
cigarette
an
one
now
he
removed
it
from
between
his
lips
with
that
hand
that
always
shook
a
little
and
dropped
it
to
the
floor
crushing
it
lightly
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
he
threw
back
his
handsome
head
and
sent
out
the
last
mouthful
of
smoke
in
a
thin
lazy
spiral
i
remember
thinking
what
a
pity
it
was
that
he
should
have
crushed
that
cigarette
just
for
me
my
name
orme
he
said
gravely
peter
orme
and
if
yours
shaughnessy
or
burke
at
least
then
i
no
judge
of
what
black
hair
and
gray
eyes
stand
then
you
not
retorted
i
laughing
up
at
him
for
it
happens
to
be
dawn
if
ye
he
picked
up
a
trifle
that
lay
on
my
desk
a
pencil
perhaps
or
a
bit
of
paper
and
toyed
with
it
absently
as
though
i
had
not
spoken
i
thought
he
had
not
heard
and
i
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
bit
embarrassed
and
very
young
suddenly
he
raised
his
smoldering
eyes
to
mine
and
i
saw
that
they
had
taken
on
a
deeper
glow
his
white
even
teeth
showed
in
a
half
smile
dawn
said
he
slowly
and
the
name
had
never
sounded
in
the
least
like
music
before
dawn
it
sounds
like
a
rose
a
pink
blush
rose
that
is
deeper
pink
at
its
heart
and
very
he
picked
up
the
trifle
with
which
he
had
been
toying
and
eyed
it
intently
for
a
moment
as
though
his
whole
mind
were
absorbed
in
it
then
he
put
it
down
turned
and
walked
slowly
away
i
sat
staring
after
him
like
a
little
simpleton
puzzled
bewildered
stunned
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
it
all
he
had
what
we
irish
call
a
way
wid
i
wonder
now
why
i
did
not
go
mad
with
the
joy
and
the
pain
and
the
uncertainty
of
it
all
never
was
a
girl
so
dazzled
so
humbled
so
worshiped
so
neglected
so
courted
he
was
a
creature
of
a
thousand
moods
to
torture
one
what
guise
would
he
wear
would
he
be
gay
or
dour
or
sullen
or
teasing
or
passionate
or
cold
or
tender
or
scintillating
i
know
that
my
hands
were
always
cold
and
my
cheeks
were
always
hot
those
days
he
wrote
like
a
modern
demosthenes
with
all
political
new
york
to
quiver
under
his
philippics
the
managing
editor
used
to
send
him
out
on
wonderful
assignments
and
they
used
to
hold
the
paper
for
his
stuff
when
it
was
late
sometimes
he
would
be
gone
for
days
at
a
time
and
when
he
returned
the
men
would
look
at
him
with
a
sort
of
admiring
awe
and
the
city
editor
would
glance
up
from
beneath
his
green
and
call
out
say
orme
for
a
man
who
has
just
wired
in
about
a
million
worth
of
stuff
seems
to
me
you
do
look
very
crisp
and
have
slept
for
a
week
peter
orme
would
growl
and
then
he
would
brush
past
the
men
who
were
crowded
around
him
and
turn
in
my
direction
and
the
old
happy
frightened
laughing
sobbing
sensation
would
have
me
by
the
throat
again
well
we
were
married
love
cast
a
glamour
over
his
very
vices
his
love
of
drink
a
weakness
which
i
would
transform
into
strength
his
white
hot
flashes
of
uncontrollable
temper
surely
they
would
die
down
at
my
cool
tender
touch
his
fits
of
abstraction
and
irritability
mere
evidences
of
the
genius
within
oh
my
worshiping
soul
was
always
alert
with
an
excuse
and
so
we
were
married
he
had
quite
tired
of
me
in
less
than
a
year
and
the
hand
that
had
always
shaken
a
little
shook
a
great
deal
now
and
the
fits
of
abstraction
and
temper
could
be
counted
upon
to
appear
oftener
than
any
other
moods
i
used
to
laugh
sometimes
when
i
was
alone
at
the
bitter
humor
of
it
all
it
was
like
a
duchess
novel
come
to
life
his
work
began
to
show
slipshod
in
spots
they
talked
to
him
about
it
and
he
laughed
at
them
then
one
day
he
left
them
in
the
ditch
on
the
big
story
of
the
mcmanus
indictment
and
the
whole
town
scooped
him
and
the
managing
editor
told
him
that
he
must
go
his
lapses
had
become
too
frequent
they
would
have
to
replace
him
with
a
man
not
so
brilliant
perhaps
but
more
reliable
i
dare
think
of
his
face
as
it
looked
when
he
came
home
to
the
little
apartment
and
told
me
the
smoldering
eyes
were
flaming
now
his
lips
were
flecked
with
a
sort
of
foam
i
stared
at
him
in
horror
he
strode
over
to
me
clasped
his
fingers
about
my
throat
and
shook
me
as
a
dog
shakes
a
mouse
why
do
you
cry
eh
he
snarled
why
do
you
cry
and
then
i
did
cry
out
at
what
i
saw
in
his
eyes
i
wrenched
myself
free
fled
to
my
room
and
locked
the
door
and
stood
against
it
with
my
hand
pressed
over
my
heart
until
i
heard
the
outer
door
slam
and
the
echo
of
his
footsteps
die
away
divorce
that
was
my
only
salvation
no
that
would
be
cowardly
now
i
would
wait
until
he
was
on
his
feet
again
and
then
i
would
demand
my
old
free
life
back
once
more
this
existence
that
was
dragging
me
into
the
gutter
this
was
not
life
life
was
a
glorious
beautiful
thing
and
i
would
have
it
yet
i
laid
my
plans
feverishly
and
waited
he
did
not
come
back
that
night
or
the
next
or
the
next
or
the
next
in
desperation
i
went
to
see
the
men
at
the
office
no
they
had
not
seen
him
was
there
anything
that
they
could
do
they
asked
i
smiled
and
thanked
them
and
said
oh
peter
was
so
no
doubt
he
had
misdirected
his
letters
or
something
of
the
sort
and
then
i
went
back
to
the
flat
to
resume
the
horrible
waiting
one
week
later
he
turned
up
at
the
old
office
which
had
cast
him
off
he
sat
down
at
his
former
desk
and
began
to
write
breathlessly
as
he
used
to
in
the
days
when
all
the
big
stories
fell
to
him
one
of
the
men
reporters
strolled
up
to
him
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
peter
orme
raised
his
head
and
stared
at
him
and
the
man
sprang
back
in
terror
the
smoldering
eyes
had
burned
down
to
an
ash
peter
orme
was
quite
bereft
of
all
reason
they
took
him
away
that
night
and
i
kept
telling
myself
that
it
was
true
that
it
was
all
a
nasty
dream
and
i
would
wake
up
pretty
soon
and
laugh
about
it
and
tell
it
at
the
breakfast
table
well
one
does
not
seek
a
divorce
from
a
husband
who
is
insane
the
busy
men
on
the
great
paper
were
very
kind
they
would
take
me
back
on
the
staff
did
i
think
that
i
still
could
write
those
amusing
little
human
interest
stories
funny
ones
you
know
with
a
punch
in
oh
plenty
of
good
stories
left
in
me
yet
i
assured
them
they
must
remember
that
i
was
only
after
all
and
at
one
does
not
lose
the
sense
of
humor
and
so
i
went
back
to
my
old
desk
and
wrote
bright
chatty
letters
home
to
norah
and
ground
out
very
funny
stories
with
a
punch
in
that
the
husband
in
the
insane
asylum
might
be
kept
in
comforts
with
both
hands
i
hung
on
like
grim
death
to
that
saving
sense
of
humor
resolved
to
make
something
of
that
miserable
mess
which
was
my
life
to
make
something
of
it
yet
and
now
at
this
point
in
my
musings
there
was
an
end
of
the
conversation
in
the
hall
sis
tiptoed
in
and
looked
her
disapproval
at
finding
me
sleepless
dawn
old
girlie
this
will
never
do
shut
your
eyes
now
like
a
good
child
and
go
to
sleep
guess
what
that
great
brute
of
a
doctor
said
i
may
take
you
home
with
me
next
week
dawn
dear
you
will
come
you
you
must
this
is
killing
you
do
make
me
go
away
leaving
you
here
i
could
stand
she
leaned
over
my
pillow
and
closed
my
eyelids
gently
with
her
sweet
cool
fingers
you
are
coming
home
with
me
and
you
shall
sleep
and
eat
and
sleep
and
eat
until
you
are
as
lively
as
the
widow
malone
ohone
and
twice
as
fat
home
dawnie
dear
where
we
forget
all
about
new
york
home
with
i
reached
up
uncertainly
and
brought
her
hand
down
to
my
lips
and
a
great
peace
descended
upon
my
sick
soul
home
with
you
i
said
like
a
child
and
fell
asleep
chapter
ii
mostly
eggs
oh
but
it
was
clean
and
sweet
and
wonderfully
still
that
room
at
norah
no
street
cars
to
tear
at
one
nerves
with
grinding
brakes
and
clanging
bells
no
tramping
of
restless
feet
on
the
concrete
all
through
the
long
noisy
hours
no
shrieking
midnight
not
one
of
the
hundred
sounds
which
make
night
hideous
in
the
city
what
bliss
to
lie
there
hour
after
hour
in
a
delicious
wholly
exquisite
stupor
only
rousing
myself
to
swallow
no
and
then
to
flop
back
again
on
the
big
cool
pillow
new
york
with
its
lights
its
clangor
its
millions
was
only
a
jumbled
nightmare
the
office
with
its
clacking
typewriters
its
insistent
telephone
bells
its
systematic
rush
its
city
room
was
but
an
ugly
part
of
the
dream
back
to
that
inferno
of
haste
and
scramble
and
clatter
never
never
i
resolved
drowsily
and
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
and
the
sheets
oh
those
sheets
of
norah
why
they
were
white
instead
of
gray
and
they
actually
smelled
of
flowers
for
that
matter
there
were
rosebuds
on
the
silken
coverlet
it
took
me
a
week
to
get
chummy
with
that
quilt
i
had
to
explain
carefully
to
norah
that
after
a
years
of
sleeping
under
doubtful
blankets
one
does
not
so
soon
get
rid
of
a
shuddering
disgust
for
coverings
which
are
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
a
hundred
unknown
sleepers
those
years
had
taught
me
to
draw
up
the
sheet
with
scrupulous
care
to
turn
it
down
and
smooth
it
over
so
that
no
contaminating
and
woolly
blanket
should
touch
my
skin
the
habit
stuck
even
after
norah
had
tucked
me
in
between
her
fragrant
sheets
automatically
my
hands
groped
about
arranging
the
old
protecting
barrier
what
the
matter
inquired
norah
looking
on
that
down
quilt
wo
bite
you
what
an
old
maid
you
are
do
like
blankets
next
to
my
face
i
elucidated
sleepily
never
can
tell
who
slept
under
last
you
cat
exclaimed
norah
making
a
little
rush
at
me
if
you
supposed
to
be
ill
i
shake
you
comparing
my
darling
rosebud
quilt
to
your
miserable
gray
blankets
just
for
that
i
make
you
eat
an
extra
pair
of
there
never
was
a
sister
like
norah
but
then
who
ever
heard
of
a
like
max
no
woman
not
even
a
newspaper
woman
could
receive
the
love
and
care
that
they
gave
me
and
fail
to
flourish
under
it
they
had
been
dad
and
mother
to
me
since
the
day
when
norah
had
tucked
me
under
her
arm
and
carried
me
away
from
new
york
sis
was
an
angel
a
comforting
angel
with
white
apron
strings
for
wings
and
a
tempting
tray
in
her
hands
in
place
of
the
hymn
books
and
palm
leaves
that
the
angels
carry
she
coaxed
the
inevitable
eggs
and
beef
into
more
tempting
forms
than
rorer
ever
guessed
at
she
could
disguise
those
two
plain
nourishing
articles
of
diet
so
effectually
that
neither
hen
nor
cow
would
have
suspected
either
of
having
once
been
part
of
her
anatomy
once
i
ate
halfway
through
a
melting
fluffy
plate
of
something
before
i
discovered
that
it
was
only
another
egg
in
disguise
feel
like
eating
a
great
big
dinner
kidlet
norah
would
ask
in
the
morning
as
she
stood
at
my
bedside
with
a
glass
of
in
her
hand
of
course
eat
horror
and
disgust
shuddering
through
my
voice
eat
ugh
do
of
it
to
me
and
for
pity
sake
tell
frieda
to
shut
the
kitchen
door
when
you
go
down
will
you
i
can
smell
something
like
ugh
like
pot
roast
with
gravy
and
i
would
turn
my
face
to
the
wall
three
hours
later
i
would
hear
sis
coming
softly
up
the
stairs
accompanied
by
a
tinkling
of
china
and
glass
i
would
face
her
all
protest
did
i
tell
you
sis
that
i
could
eat
a
mouthful
not
a
mouthf
how
perfectly
scrumptious
that
looks
what
that
affair
in
the
lettuce
leaf
oh
ca
i
begin
on
that
pinky
stuff
in
the
tall
glass
h
oh
please
i
thought
norah
would
begin
and
then
she
would
snigger
softly
oh
well
that
was
hours
ago
i
would
explain
loftily
perhaps
i
could
manage
a
bite
or
two
whereupon
i
would
demolish
everything
except
the
china
and
doilies
it
was
at
this
point
on
the
road
to
recovery
just
halfway
between
illness
and
health
that
norah
and
max
brought
the
great
and
unsmiling
von
gerhard
on
the
scene
it
appeared
that
even
new
york
was
respectfully
aware
of
von
gerhard
the
nerve
specialist
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
lived
in
milwaukee
the
idea
of
bringing
him
up
to
look
at
me
occurred
to
max
quite
suddenly
i
think
it
was
on
the
evening
that
i
burst
into
tears
when
max
entered
the
room
wearing
a
squeaky
shoe
the
weeping
walrus
was
a
and
tranquil
creature
compared
to
me
at
that
time
the
sight
of
a
fly
on
the
wall
was
enough
to
make
me
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobs
i
know
the
boy
to
steady
those
shaky
nerves
of
yours
dawn
said
max
after
i
had
made
a
shamefaced
apology
for
my
hysterical
weeping
going
to
have
von
gerhard
up
here
to
look
at
you
he
can
run
up
sunday
eh
norah
who
von
gerhard
i
inquired
out
of
the
depths
of
my
ignorance
anyway
i
wo
have
him
i
bet
he
wears
a
vandyke
and
von
gerhard
exclaimed
norah
indignantly
you
ought
to
be
thankful
to
have
him
look
at
you
even
if
he
wears
goggles
and
a
flowing
beard
why
even
that
new
york
doctor
of
yours
cringed
and
looked
impressed
when
i
told
him
that
von
gerhard
was
a
friend
of
my
husband
and
that
they
had
been
comrades
at
heidelberg
i
must
have
mentioned
him
dozens
of
times
in
my
queer
commented
max
he
runs
up
here
every
now
and
then
to
spend
a
quiet
sunday
with
norah
and
me
and
the
spalpeens
says
it
rests
him
the
kids
swarm
all
over
him
and
tear
him
limb
from
limb
it
does
look
restful
but
he
says
it
great
i
think
he
came
here
from
berlin
just
after
you
left
for
new
york
dawn
milwaukee
fits
him
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
but
you
not
going
to
drag
this
wonderful
being
up
here
just
for
me
i
protested
aghast
max
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
me
from
the
doorway
are
you
what
the
bromides
call
a
bundle
of
nerves
and
is
von
gerhard
specialty
untying
just
those
knots
i
write
to
him
and
he
did
and
von
gerhard
came
the
spalpeens
watched
for
him
their
noses
flattened
against
the
for
it
was
raining
as
he
came
up
the
path
they
burst
out
of
the
door
to
meet
him
from
my
bedroom
window
i
saw
him
come
prancing
up
the
walk
like
a
boy
with
the
two
children
clinging
to
his
all
three
quite
unmindful
of
the
rain
and
yelling
like
comanches
ten
minutes
later
he
had
donned
his
professional
dignity
entered
my
room
and
beheld
me
in
all
my
limp
and
beauty
i
noted
approvingly
that
he
had
to
stoop
a
bit
as
he
entered
the
low
doorway
and
that
the
vandyke
of
my
prophecy
was
missing
he
took
my
hand
in
his
own
steady
reassuring
clasp
then
he
began
to
talk
half
an
hour
sped
away
while
we
discussed
new
york
books
music
theatres
everything
and
anything
but
dawn
i
learned
later
that
as
we
chatted
he
was
getting
his
story
bit
by
bit
from
every
twitch
of
the
eyelids
from
every
gesture
of
the
hands
that
had
grown
too
thin
to
wear
the
hateful
ring
from
every
motion
of
the
lips
from
the
color
of
my
nails
from
each
convulsive
muscle
from
every
shadow
and
wrinkle
and
curve
and
line
of
my
face
suddenly
he
asked
are
you
making
the
proper
effort
to
get
well
you
try
to
conquer
those
jumping
nerfs
yes
i
glared
at
him
try
i
do
everything
i
eat
woolly
worms
if
i
thought
they
might
benefit
me
if
ever
a
girl
has
minded
her
big
sister
and
her
doctor
that
girl
is
i
eaten
everything
from
pate
de
foie
gras
to
raw
beef
and
i
drunk
everything
from
blood
to
eggs
queried
von
gerhard
as
though
making
a
happy
suggestion
eggs
i
snorted
eggs
thousands
of
eggs
hard
and
soft
boiled
poached
and
fried
scrambled
and
shirred
eggs
in
beer
and
egg
lemonades
and
egg
orangeades
eggs
in
wine
and
eggs
in
milk
and
eggs
au
naturel
i
lapped
up
and
whole
rivers
of
milk
and
i
devoured
rare
porterhouse
and
roast
beef
day
after
day
for
weeks
so
eggs
mein
himmel
ejaculated
he
fervently
and
you
still
live
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
dawned
in
his
eyes
i
wondered
if
he
ever
laughed
i
would
experiment
do
breathe
it
to
a
soul
i
whispered
tragically
but
eggs
and
eggs
alone
are
turning
my
love
for
my
sister
into
bitterest
hate
she
stalks
me
the
whole
day
long
forcing
egg
mixtures
down
my
unwilling
throat
she
bullies
me
i
dare
put
out
my
hand
suddenly
without
knocking
over
liquid
refreshment
in
some
form
but
certainly
with
an
egg
lurking
in
its
depths
i
am
so
expert
that
i
can
tell
an
egg
orangeade
from
an
egg
lemonade
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
with
my
left
hand
tied
behind
me
and
one
eye
shut
and
my
feet
in
a
you
can
laugh
eh
well
that
iss
good
commented
the
grave
and
unsmiling
one
sure
answered
i
made
more
flippant
by
his
solemnity
surely
i
can
laugh
for
what
else
was
my
father
irish
dad
used
to
say
that
a
sense
of
humor
was
like
a
shillaly
an
iligent
thing
to
have
around
handy
especially
when
the
joke
on
the
ghost
of
a
twinkle
appeared
again
in
the
corners
of
the
german
blue
eyes
some
fiend
of
rudeness
seized
me
laugh
i
commanded
ernst
von
gerhard
stiffened
pardon
inquired
he
as
one
who
is
sure
that
he
has
misunderstood
laugh
i
snapped
again
i
dare
you
to
do
it
i
double
dare
you
you
dasse
but
he
did
after
a
moment
bewildered
surprise
he
threw
back
his
handsome
blond
head
and
gave
vent
to
a
great
deep
infectious
roar
of
mirth
that
brought
the
spalpeens
tumbling
up
the
stairs
in
defiance
of
their
mother
strict
instructions
after
that
we
got
along
beautifully
he
turned
out
to
be
quite
human
beneath
the
outer
crust
of
reserve
he
continued
his
examination
only
after
bribing
the
spalpeens
shamefully
so
that
even
their
rapacious
demands
were
satisfied
and
they
trotted
off
contentedly
there
followed
a
process
which
reduced
me
to
a
giggling
heap
but
which
von
gerhard
carried
out
ceremoniously
it
consisted
of
certain
raps
at
my
knees
and
shins
and
elbows
and
fingers
and
certain
commands
to
look
at
my
finger
look
at
the
wall
look
at
my
finger
look
at
the
wall
so
said
von
gerhard
at
last
in
a
tone
of
finality
i
sank
my
battered
frame
into
the
nearest
chair
this
this
newspaper
work
it
must
he
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
certainly
i
said
with
elaborate
sarcasm
how
should
you
advise
me
to
earn
my
living
in
the
future
in
the
stories
they
paint
dinner
cards
do
they
or
bake
angel
cakes
are
you
then
never
serious
asked
von
gerhard
in
disapproval
never
said
i
an
old
newspaper
reporter
with
a
husband
in
the
ca
afford
to
be
serious
for
a
minute
because
if
she
were
she
go
mad
too
with
the
hopelessness
of
it
and
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
the
room
was
very
still
for
a
moment
then
the
great
von
gerhard
came
over
and
took
my
hands
gently
from
my
face
i
i
do
beg
your
pardon
he
said
he
looked
strangely
boyish
and
uncomfortable
as
he
said
it
i
was
thinking
only
of
your
good
we
do
that
sometimes
forgetting
that
circumstances
may
make
our
wishes
impossible
of
execution
so
you
will
forgive
me
forgive
you
yes
indeed
i
assured
him
and
we
shook
hands
gravely
but
that
does
help
matters
much
after
all
does
it
yes
it
helps
for
now
we
understand
one
another
is
it
not
so
you
say
you
can
only
write
for
a
living
then
why
not
write
here
at
home
surely
these
years
of
newspaper
work
have
given
you
a
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
then
too
there
is
your
gift
of
humor
surely
that
is
a
combination
which
should
make
your
work
acceptable
to
the
magazines
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
so
many
magazines
as
here
in
the
united
states
but
hundreds
thousands
me
i
exploded
a
real
writer
lady
no
more
interviews
with
actresses
no
more
slushy
sunday
specials
no
more
teary
tales
oh
my
when
may
i
begin
you
know
i
brought
my
typewriter
with
me
i
almost
forgotten
where
the
letters
are
on
the
wait
wait
not
so
fast
in
a
month
or
two
perhaps
but
first
must
come
other
things
outdoor
things
also
housework
i
echoed
feebly
naturlich
a
little
dusting
a
little
scrubbing
a
little
sweeping
a
little
cooking
the
finest
kind
of
indoor
exercise
later
you
may
write
a
little
but
very
little
run
and
play
out
of
doors
with
the
children
when
i
see
you
again
you
will
have
roses
in
your
cheeks
like
the
german
girls
yes
yes
i
echoed
meekly
i
wonder
how
frieda
will
like
my
elephantine
efforts
at
assisting
with
the
housework
if
she
gives
notice
norah
will
be
lost
to
but
frieda
did
not
give
notice
after
i
had
helped
her
clean
the
kitchen
and
the
pantry
i
noticed
an
expression
of
deepest
pity
overspreading
her
lumpy
features
the
expression
became
almost
one
of
agony
as
she
watched
me
roll
out
some
noodles
for
soup
and
delve
into
the
sticky
mysteries
of
a
new
kind
of
cake
max
says
that
for
a
poor
working
girl
who
has
had
time
to
cultivate
the
domestic
graces
my
cakes
are
a
distinct
triumph
sis
sniffs
at
that
and
mutters
something
about
cups
of
raisins
and
nuts
and
citron
hiding
a
multitude
of
batter
sins
she
never
allows
the
spalpeens
to
eat
my
cakes
and
on
my
baking
days
they
are
usually
sent
from
the
table
howling
norah
declares
severely
that
she
is
going
to
hide
the
green
cook
book
the
green
cook
book
is
a
german
one
norah
bought
it
in
deference
to
max
love
of
german
cookery
it
is
called
aunt
cook
book
and
the
author
between
hints
as
to
flour
and
butter
gets
delightfully
chummy
with
her
pupil
her
cakes
are
proud
rich
cakes
she
orders
grandly
now
throw
in
the
yolks
of
twelve
eggs
of
a
pound
of
almonds
two
pounds
of
raisins
a
pound
of
citron
a
pound
of
as
if
that
were
not
enough
there
follow
minor
instructions
as
to
trifles
like
ounces
of
walnut
meats
pounds
of
confectioner
sugar
and
pints
of
very
rich
cream
when
cold
to
be
frosted
with
an
icing
made
up
of
more
eggs
more
nuts
more
cream
more
everything
the
children
have
appointed
themselves
official
lickers
and
scrapers
of
the
spoons
and
icing
pans
also
official
guides
on
their
walks
they
regard
their
aunt
dawn
as
a
quite
ridiculous
but
altogether
delightful
old
thing
and
norah
bless
her
looks
up
when
i
come
in
from
a
romp
with
the
spalpeens
and
says
your
cheeks
are
pink
actually
and
you
losing
a
puff
there
at
the
back
of
your
ear
and
your
hat
on
crooked
oh
you
are
beginning
to
look
your
old
self
dawn
dear
at
which
doubtful
compliment
i
retort
recklessly
pooh
what
a
puff
more
or
less
in
a
worthy
cause
and
if
you
think
my
cheeks
are
pink
now
just
wait
until
your
mighty
von
gerhard
comes
again
by
that
time
they
shall
be
so
red
and
bursting
that
frieda
on
wash
day
will
look
anemic
by
comparison
say
norah
how
red
are
german
red
cheeks
anyway
chapter
iii
good
as
new
so
spring
danced
away
and
summer
sauntered
in
my
pillows
looked
less
and
less
tempting
the
wine
of
the
northern
air
imparted
a
cocky
assurance
one
day
followed
the
other
and
i
spent
hours
together
out
of
doors
in
the
sunshine
lying
full
length
on
the
warm
sweet
ground
to
the
horror
of
the
entire
neighborhood
to
be
sure
i
was
sufficiently
discreet
to
choose
the
lawn
at
the
rear
of
the
house
there
i
drank
in
the
atmosphere
as
per
doctor
instructions
while
the
genial
sun
warmed
the
watery
blood
in
my
veins
and
burned
the
skin
off
the
end
of
my
nose
all
my
life
i
had
envied
the
loungers
in
the
parks
those
silent
inert
figures
that
lie
under
the
trees
all
the
long
summer
day
their
shabby
hats
over
their
faces
their
hands
clasped
above
their
heads
legs
sprawled
in
uncouth
comfort
while
the
sun
dapples
down
between
the
leaves
and
like
a
good
fairy
godmother
touches
their
frayed
and
wrinkled
garments
with
flickering
figures
of
golden
splendor
while
they
sleep
they
always
seemed
so
blissfully
and
at
ease
those
sprawling
men
figures
and
i
to
whom
such
simple
joys
were
forbidden
being
a
woman
had
envied
them
now
i
was
reveling
in
that
very
joy
stretched
prone
upon
the
ground
blinking
sleepily
up
at
the
sun
and
the
cobalt
sky
feeling
my
very
hair
grow
and
health
returning
in
warm
electric
waves
i
even
dared
to
cross
one
leg
over
the
other
and
to
swing
the
pendant
member
with
nonchalant
air
first
taking
a
cautious
survey
of
the
neighboring
back
windows
to
see
if
any
one
peeked
doubtless
they
did
behind
those
ruffled
curtains
but
i
grew
splendidly
indifferent
even
the
crawling
things
and
there
were
myriads
of
them
added
to
the
enjoyment
of
my
ease
with
my
ear
so
close
to
the
ground
the
grass
seemed
fairly
to
buzz
with
them
everywhere
there
were
crazily
busy
ants
and
i
patently
a
sluggard
and
therefore
one
of
those
for
whom
the
ancient
warning
was
intended
considered
them
lazily
how
they
plunged
about
weaving
in
and
out
rushing
here
and
there
like
women
darting
wildly
from
counter
to
counter
o
foolish
foolish
antics
i
chided
them
stop
wearing
yourselves
out
this
way
do
you
know
that
the
game
is
worth
the
candle
and
that
you
give
yourselves
nervous
and
then
you
have
to
go
home
to
be
patched
up
look
at
me
i
a
horrible
but
they
only
bustled
on
heedless
of
my
advice
and
showed
their
contempt
by
crawling
over
me
as
i
lay
there
like
a
lady
gulliver
oh
i
played
what
they
call
a
heavy
thinking
part
it
was
not
only
the
ants
that
came
in
for
lectures
i
preached
sternly
to
myself
well
dawn
old
girl
you
made
a
beautiful
mess
of
it
a
wreck
at
and
what
have
you
to
show
for
it
nothing
a
useless
pulp
like
a
lemon
that
has
been
squeezed
dry
von
gerhard
was
right
there
must
be
no
more
newspaper
work
for
you
me
girl
not
if
you
can
keep
away
from
the
fascination
of
it
which
i
do
think
you
then
i
would
fall
to
thinking
of
those
years
of
newspapering
of
the
thrills
of
them
and
the
ills
of
them
it
had
been
exhilarating
and
educating
but
scarcely
remunerative
mother
had
never
approved
dad
had
chuckled
and
said
that
it
was
a
curse
descended
upon
me
from
the
terrible
old
kitty
the
only
old
maid
in
the
history
of
the
and
famed
in
her
day
for
a
caustic
tongue
and
a
venomed
pen
dad
and
mother
what
a
pair
of
children
they
had
been
the
very
dissimilarity
of
their
natures
had
been
a
bond
between
them
dad
whimsical
improvident
mother
gravely
sweet
trying
to
teach
economy
to
the
handsome
irish
husband
who
descendant
of
a
long
and
royal
line
of
spendthrift
ancestors
would
have
none
of
it
it
was
dad
who
had
insisted
that
they
name
me
dawn
dawn
his
sense
of
humor
must
have
been
sleeping
you
were
such
a
rosy
pinky
soft
baby
thing
mother
had
once
told
me
that
you
looked
just
like
the
first
flush
of
light
at
sunrise
that
is
why
your
father
insisted
on
calling
you
poor
dad
how
could
he
know
that
at
i
would
be
a
yellow
wreck
of
a
newspaper
reporter
with
a
wrinkle
between
my
eyes
if
he
could
see
me
now
he
would
say
sure
you
look
like
the
dawn
yet
me
girl
but
a
pittsburgh
at
that
mother
if
she
were
here
would
pat
my
check
where
the
hollow
place
is
and
murmur
never
mind
dawnie
dearie
mother
thinks
you
are
beautiful
just
the
of
such
blessed
stuff
are
mothers
made
at
this
stage
of
the
memory
game
i
would
bury
my
face
in
the
warm
grass
and
thank
my
god
for
having
taken
mother
before
peter
orme
came
into
my
life
and
then
i
would
fall
asleep
there
on
the
soft
sweet
grass
with
my
head
snuggled
in
my
arms
and
the
ants
wriggling
unchided
into
my
ears
on
the
last
of
these
sylvan
occasions
i
awoke
not
with
a
graceful
start
like
the
ladies
but
with
a
grunt
sis
was
digging
me
in
the
ribs
with
her
toe
i
looked
up
to
see
her
standing
over
me
a
foaming
tumbler
of
something
in
her
hand
i
felt
that
it
was
eggy
and
eyed
it
disgustedly
get
up
said
she
you
lazy
scribbler
and
drink
i
sat
up
eyeing
her
severely
and
picking
grass
and
ants
out
of
my
hair
d
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
woke
me
out
of
that
slumber
to
make
me
drink
that
goo
what
is
it
anyway
i
bet
it
another
it
is
and
swallow
it
right
away
because
there
are
guests
to
see
i
emerged
from
the
first
dip
into
the
yellow
mixture
and
fixed
on
her
as
stern
and
terrible
a
look
at
any
one
can
whose
mouth
is
encircled
by
a
mustache
of
yellow
foam
guests
i
roared
not
for
me
do
you
dare
to
say
that
they
came
to
see
me
did
too
insists
norah
with
firmness
they
came
especially
to
see
you
asked
for
you
right
from
the
i
finished
the
in
four
gulps
returned
the
empty
tumbler
with
an
air
of
decision
and
sank
upon
the
grass
tell
i
rave
tell
that
i
unconscious
and
that
for
weeks
i
have
recognized
no
one
not
even
my
dear
sister
say
that
in
my
present
condition
i
that
would
satisfy
them
norah
calmly
interrupts
they
know
you
crazy
because
they
saw
you
out
here
from
their
second
story
back
windows
that
why
they
came
so
you
may
as
well
get
up
and
face
them
i
promised
them
i
bring
you
in
you
ca
go
on
forever
refusing
to
see
people
and
you
know
the
whalens
are
whalens
i
gasped
how
many
of
them
not
not
the
entire
fiendish
three
all
three
i
left
them
champing
with
the
whalens
live
just
around
the
corner
the
whalens
are
omniscient
they
have
a
system
of
news
gathering
which
would
make
the
efforts
of
a
new
york
daily
appear
antiquated
they
know
that
jenny
laffin
feeds
the
family
on
soup
meat
and
when
laffin
is
on
the
road
they
know
that
pearson
only
shakes
out
her
rugs
once
in
four
weeks
they
can
tell
you
the
number
of
times
a
week
that
sam
dempster
comes
home
drunk
they
know
that
the
merkles
never
have
cream
with
their
coffee
because
little
lizzie
merkle
goes
to
the
creamery
every
day
with
just
one
pail
and
three
cents
they
gloat
over
the
knowledge
that
professor
grimes
who
is
a
married
man
is
sweet
on
gertie
ashe
who
teaches
second
reader
in
his
school
they
can
tell
you
where
black
got
her
seal
coat
and
her
husband
only
earning
two
thousand
a
year
they
know
who
is
going
to
run
for
mayor
and
how
long
poor
angela
sims
has
to
live
and
what
guy
donnelly
said
to
min
when
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
the
three
whalens
mother
and
daughters
hunt
in
a
group
they
send
meaning
glances
to
one
another
across
the
room
and
at
parties
they
get
together
and
exchange
bulletins
in
a
corner
on
passing
the
whalen
house
one
is
uncomfortably
aware
of
shadowy
forms
lurking
in
the
windows
and
of
parlor
curtains
that
are
agitated
for
no
apparent
cause
therefore
it
was
with
a
groan
that
i
rose
and
prepared
to
follow
norah
into
the
house
something
in
my
eye
caused
her
to
turn
at
the
very
door
do
you
dare
she
hissed
then
banishing
the
warning
scowl
from
her
face
and
assuming
a
she
entered
the
room
and
i
followed
miserably
at
her
heels
the
whalens
rose
and
came
forward
effusively
whalen
plump
dark
voluble
sally
lean
swarthy
vindictive
flossie
pudgy
powdered
they
eyed
me
hungrily
i
felt
that
they
were
searching
my
features
for
signs
of
incipient
insanity
dear
dear
girl
bubbled
the
billowy
flossie
kissing
the
end
of
my
nose
and
fastening
her
eye
on
my
ringless
left
hand
sally
contented
herself
with
a
limp
and
fishy
handshake
she
and
i
were
sworn
enemies
in
our
days
and
a
baleful
gleam
still
lurked
in
sally
eye
whalen
bestowed
on
me
a
motherly
hug
that
enveloped
me
in
an
atmosphere
of
liquid
strong
perfumery
and
fried
lard
whalen
is
a
famous
cook
said
she
we
been
thinking
of
calling
ever
since
you
were
brought
home
but
dear
me
you
been
looking
so
poorly
i
just
said
to
the
girls
wait
till
the
poor
thing
feels
more
like
seeing
her
old
friends
tell
me
how
are
you
feeling
now
the
three
sat
forward
in
their
chairs
in
attitudes
of
tense
waiting
i
resolved
that
if
err
i
must
it
should
be
on
the
side
of
safety
i
turned
to
sister
norah
how
am
i
feeling
anyway
norah
i
guardedly
inquired
norah
face
was
a
study
why
dawn
dear
she
said
no
doubt
you
know
better
than
i
but
i
sure
that
you
are
wonderfully
improved
almost
your
old
self
in
fact
do
you
think
she
looks
splendid
whalen
the
three
whalens
tore
their
gaze
from
my
blank
countenance
to
exchange
a
series
of
meaning
looks
i
suppose
purred
whalen
that
your
awful
trouble
was
the
real
cause
of
your
worrying
about
it
and
grieving
as
you
must
she
pronounces
it
with
a
capital
t
and
i
know
she
means
peter
i
hate
her
for
it
trouble
i
chirped
trouble
never
troubles
me
i
just
worked
too
hard
that
all
and
acquired
an
awful
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jill
a
nervous
wreck
you
at
that
the
elephantine
flossie
wagged
a
playful
finger
at
me
oh
now
you
ca
make
us
believe
that
just
because
we
from
the
country
we
know
all
about
you
gay
new
yorkers
with
your
bohemian
ways
and
your
midnight
studio
suppers
and
your
cigarettes
and
cocktails
and
high
jinks
memory
painted
a
swift
mental
picture
of
dawn
as
she
used
to
tumble
into
bed
after
a
whirlwind
day
at
the
office
too
to
give
her
hair
even
one
half
of
the
prescribed
one
hundred
strokes
of
the
brush
but
in
turn
i
shook
a
reproving
forefinger
at
flossie
you
been
reading
some
naughty
society
novel
one
of
those
novels
dear
dear
shall
i
ever
forget
the
first
new
york
actress
i
ever
met
or
what
she
said
i
felt
more
than
saw
a
warning
movement
from
sis
but
the
three
whalens
had
hitched
forward
in
their
chairs
what
did
she
say
gurgled
flossie
was
it
something
real
reezk
well
it
was
at
a
late
supper
a
studio
supper
given
in
her
honor
i
confessed
hissed
the
whalens
and
this
actress
she
was
one
of
those
musical
comedy
actresses
you
know
i
remember
her
part
called
for
a
good
deal
of
kicking
about
in
a
short
dutch
costume
came
in
rather
late
after
the
performance
she
was
wearing
a
evening
wrap
and
she
still
wore
all
her
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
sis
sink
back
with
an
air
of
resignation
and
she
threw
open
the
door
and
said
hissed
the
whalens
again
wetting
their
lips
said
i
just
had
a
wire
from
mother
up
in
maine
the
boy
has
the
croup
i
scared
green
i
hate
to
spoil
the
party
but
do
ask
me
to
stay
i
want
to
go
home
to
the
flat
and
blubber
i
did
even
stop
to
take
my
off
my
god
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
boy
well
have
a
good
time
without
me
jim
waiting
outside
a
silence
then
who
was
jim
asked
flossie
hopefully
jim
was
her
husband
of
course
he
was
in
the
same
another
silence
is
that
all
demanded
sally
from
the
corner
in
which
she
had
been
glowering
all
you
unnatural
girl
is
one
husband
enough
whalen
smiled
an
uncertain
wavering
smile
there
passed
among
the
three
a
series
of
cabalistic
signs
they
rose
simultaneously
how
quaint
you
are
exclaimed
whalen
and
so
amusing
come
girls
we
must
tire
miss
ah
er
with
another
meaning
look
at
my
bare
left
hand
my
husband
name
is
still
orme
i
prompted
quite
quite
pleasantly
oh
certainly
i
so
forgetful
and
one
reads
such
queer
things
in
the
newspapers
divorces
and
separations
and
and
there
was
a
note
of
gentle
insinuation
in
her
voice
norah
stepped
firmly
into
the
fray
yes
does
one
what
a
comfort
it
must
be
to
you
to
know
that
your
dear
girls
are
safe
at
home
with
you
and
no
doubt
will
be
secure
for
years
to
come
from
the
buffeting
winds
of
there
was
a
tinge
of
purple
in
whalen
face
as
she
moved
toward
the
door
gathering
her
brood
about
her
now
that
dear
dawn
is
almost
normal
again
i
shall
send
my
little
girlies
over
real
often
she
must
find
it
very
dull
here
after
her
ah
life
in
new
not
at
all
i
said
hurriedly
not
at
all
you
see
i
i
writing
a
book
my
entire
day
is
a
book
screeched
the
three
how
interesting
what
is
it
when
will
it
be
published
i
avoided
norah
baleful
eye
as
i
answered
their
questions
and
performed
the
final
adieux
as
the
door
closed
norah
and
i
faced
each
other
glaring
hussies
hissed
norah
whereupon
it
struck
us
funny
and
we
fell
a
shrieking
heap
into
the
nearest
chair
finally
sis
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
drew
a
long
breath
and
asked
with
elaborate
sarcasm
why
i
had
made
it
a
play
instead
of
a
book
while
i
was
about
it
but
i
mean
it
i
declared
i
had
enough
of
loafing
max
must
unpack
my
typewriter
i
homesick
for
a
look
at
the
keys
and
i
to
be
installed
in
the
cubbyhole
off
the
and
i
defy
any
one
to
enter
it
on
peril
of
their
lives
if
you
value
the
lives
of
your
offspring
warn
them
away
from
that
door
von
gerhard
said
that
there
was
writing
in
my
system
and
by
the
great
horn
spoon
and
the
beard
of
the
prophet
i
have
it
out
besides
i
need
the
money
norah
dear
how
does
one
set
about
writing
a
book
it
seems
like
such
a
large
chapter
iv
dawn
develops
a
heimweh
it
hard
trying
to
develop
into
a
real
writer
lady
in
the
bosom
of
one
family
especially
when
the
family
refuses
to
take
one
seriously
seven
years
of
newspaper
grind
have
taught
me
the
fallacy
of
trying
to
write
by
the
inspiration
method
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
train
of
thought
and
mine
is
constantly
being
derailed
and
wrecked
and
pitched
about
scarcely
am
i
settled
in
my
typewriter
before
me
the
working
plan
of
a
story
buzzing
about
in
my
brain
when
i
hear
my
name
called
in
muffled
tones
as
though
the
speaker
were
laboring
with
a
mouthful
of
hairpins
i
pay
no
attention
i
have
just
given
my
heroine
a
pair
of
calm
gray
eyes
shaded
with
black
lashes
and
hair
to
match
a
voice
floats
down
from
the
upstairs
regions
dawn
oh
dawn
just
run
and
rescue
the
cucumbers
out
of
the
top
of
the
will
you
the
iceman
coming
and
he
squash
a
parting
jab
at
my
heroine
hair
and
eyes
and
i
off
to
save
the
cucumbers
back
at
my
typewriter
once
more
shall
i
make
my
heroine
petite
or
grande
i
decide
that
stateliness
and
gibsonesque
height
should
accompany
the
calm
gray
eyes
i
rattle
away
happily
the
plot
unfolding
itself
in
some
mysterious
way
sis
opens
the
door
a
little
and
peers
in
she
is
dressed
for
the
street
dawn
dear
i
going
to
the
dressmaker
frieda
upstairs
cleaning
the
bathroom
so
take
a
little
squint
at
the
roast
now
and
then
will
you
see
that
it
does
burn
and
that
there
plenty
of
gravy
oh
and
dawn
tell
the
milkman
we
want
an
extra
of
cream
the
tickets
are
on
the
kitchen
shelf
back
of
the
clock
i
be
back
in
an
mhmph
i
reply
sis
shuts
the
door
but
opens
it
again
almost
immediately
do
let
the
infants
bother
you
but
if
frieda
upstairs
and
they
come
to
you
for
something
to
eat
do
let
them
have
any
cookies
before
dinner
if
they
really
hungry
they
eat
bread
and
i
promise
dreamily
my
last
typewritten
sentence
still
running
through
my
head
the
gravy
seems
to
have
got
into
the
heroine
calm
gray
eyes
what
heroine
could
remain
when
her
creator
mind
is
filled
with
roast
beef
a
elapses
before
i
get
back
on
the
track
then
appears
the
hero
a
tall
blond
youth
fair
to
behold
i
make
him
two
yards
high
and
endow
him
with
a
pair
of
shoulders
there
assails
my
nostrils
a
fearful
smell
of
scorching
the
roast
a
wild
rush
into
the
kitchen
i
fling
open
the
oven
door
the
roast
is
and
gravyless
it
takes
fifteen
minutes
of
the
most
desperate
measures
before
the
roast
is
revived
back
to
the
writing
it
has
lost
its
charm
the
heroine
is
a
stick
she
moves
like
an
indian
lady
outside
a
cigar
shop
the
hero
is
a
sissy
without
a
vital
spark
in
him
what
the
use
of
trying
to
write
anyway
nobody
wants
my
stuff
good
for
nothing
except
dubbing
on
a
newspaper
rap
rap
bing
milk
i
dash
into
the
kitchen
no
milk
no
milkman
i
fly
to
the
door
he
is
disappearing
around
the
corner
of
the
house
hi
milkman
say
milkman
with
frantic
beckonings
he
turns
he
lifts
up
his
voice
the
screen
door
was
locked
so
i
left
youse
yer
milk
on
top
of
the
on
the
back
porch
thought
like
the
hired
girl
was
upstairs
an
i
could
git
the
tickets
i
explain
about
the
cream
adding
that
it
is
wanted
for
the
explanation
does
not
seem
to
cheer
him
he
appears
to
be
a
very
gloomy
and
reserved
milkman
i
fancy
that
he
is
in
the
habit
of
indulging
in
a
little
airy
persiflage
with
frieda
o
mornings
and
he
finds
me
a
poor
substitute
for
her
comeliness
the
milk
safely
stowed
away
in
the
i
have
another
look
at
the
roast
i
am
dipping
up
spoonfuls
of
brown
gravy
and
pouring
them
over
the
surface
of
the
roast
in
approved
basting
style
when
there
is
a
rush
a
scramble
and
two
hard
bodies
precipitate
themselves
upon
my
legs
so
suddenly
that
for
a
moment
my
head
pitches
forward
into
the
oven
i
withdraw
my
head
from
the
oven
hastily
the
basting
spoon
is
immersed
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
i
turn
indignant
the
spalpeens
look
up
at
me
with
innocent
eyes
you
little
divils
what
do
you
mean
by
shoving
your
old
aunt
into
the
oven
it
cannibals
you
are
the
idea
pleases
them
they
release
my
legs
and
execute
a
savage
war
dance
around
me
the
spalpeens
are
firm
in
the
belief
that
i
was
brought
to
their
home
for
their
sole
amusement
and
they
refuse
to
take
me
seriously
the
spalpeens
themselves
are
two
of
the
finest
examples
of
real
humor
that
ever
were
perpetrated
upon
parents
sheila
is
the
norah
decided
that
she
should
be
an
irish
beauty
and
bestowed
upon
her
a
name
that
reeks
of
the
bogs
whereupon
sheila
at
the
age
of
six
is
as
and
and
stolid
a
little
german
madchen
as
ever
fooled
her
parents
and
she
is
a
feminine
reproduction
of
her
german
dad
two
years
later
came
a
sturdy
boy
and
they
named
him
hans
in
a
flaunt
of
defiance
hans
is
and
irish
as
killarny
we
awful
hungry
announces
sheila
ca
you
wait
until
dinner
time
such
a
grand
dinner
sheila
and
hans
roll
their
eyes
to
convey
to
me
that
were
they
to
wait
until
dinner
for
sustenance
we
should
find
but
their
lifeless
forms
well
then
auntie
will
get
a
nice
piece
of
bread
and
butter
for
each
of
do
want
bread
an
butty
shrieks
hans
want
tooky
cooky
echoes
sheila
pounding
on
the
kitchen
table
with
the
rescued
basting
spoon
you
ca
have
cookies
before
dinner
they
bad
for
your
can
too
disputes
hans
fwieda
dives

tookies
want
tooky
wailingly
please
auntie
dawnie
dearie
wheedles
sheila
wriggling
her
soft
little
fingers
in
my
hand
but
mother
never
lets
you
have
cookies
before
dinner
i
retort
severely
she
knows
they
are
bad
for
pooh
she
does
too
she
always
says
not
a
cooky
and
then
we
beg
and
screech
and
then
she
says
for
pity
sake
frieda
give
a
cooky
and
send
out
one
cooky
ca
kill
sheila
imitation
is
delicious
hans
catches
the
word
screech
and
takes
it
as
his
cue
he
begins
a
series
of
wails
sheila
surveys
him
with
pride
and
then
takes
the
wail
up
in
a
minor
key
their
teamwork
is
marvelous
i
fly
to
the
cooky
jar
and
extract
two
round
and
sugary
confections
i
thrust
them
into
the
pink
eager
palms
the
wails
cease
solemnly
they
place
one
cooky
atop
the
other
measuring
the
circlets
with
grave
eyes
mine
a
weeny
bit
yours
this
time
decides
sheila
and
holds
her
cooky
heroically
while
hans
takes
a
just
and
lawful
bite
out
of
his
sister
larger
share
the
blessed
little
angels
i
say
to
myself
melting
the
dear
unselfish
little
sweeties
and
give
each
of
them
another
cooky
back
to
my
typewriter
but
the
words
flatly
refuse
to
come
now
i
make
six
false
starts
bite
all
my
best
screw
my
hair
into
a
wilderness
of
and
give
it
up
no
doubt
a
real
lady
writer
could
write
on
unruffled
and
unhearing
while
the
iceman
squashed
the
cucumbers
and
the
roast
burned
to
a
frazzle
and
the
spalpeens
perished
of
hunger
possessed
of
the
real
spark
of
genius
trivialities
like
milkmen
and
cucumbers
could
not
dim
its
glow
perhaps
all
successful
lady
writers
with
real
live
sparks
have
cooks
and
scullery
maids
and
need
not
worry
about
basting
and
gravy
and
milkmen
this
book
writing
is
all
very
well
for
those
who
have
a
large
faith
in
the
future
and
an
equally
large
bank
account
but
my
future
will
have
to
be
and
my
bank
account
has
always
been
an
all
too
small
pay
envelope
at
the
end
of
each
week
it
will
be
months
before
the
book
is
shaped
and
finished
and
my
pocketbook
is
empty
last
week
max
sent
money
for
the
care
of
peter
he
and
norah
think
that
i
do
not
know
von
gerhard
was
here
in
august
i
told
him
that
all
my
firm
resolutions
to
forsake
newspaperdom
forever
were
slipping
away
one
by
one
i
have
heard
of
the
fascination
of
the
newspaper
office
he
said
in
his
understanding
way
i
believe
you
have
a
heimweh
for
it
not
heimweh
that
the
word
i
had
agreed
after
you
have
been
a
newspaper
writer
for
seven
years
and
loved
it
you
will
be
a
newspaper
writer
at
heart
and
by
instinct
at
least
until
you
die
there
no
getting
away
from
it
it
in
the
blood
newspaper
men
have
been
known
to
inherit
fortunes
to
enter
politics
to
write
books
and
become
famous
to
degenerate
into
press
agents
and
become
infamous
to
blossom
into
personages
to
sink
into
nonentities
but
their
remained
a
part
of
them
and
the
inky
smoky
stuffy
smell
of
a
newspaper
office
was
ever
sweet
in
their
but
not
yet
von
gerhard
had
said
it
unless
you
want
to
have
again
this
miserable
business
of
the
sick
nerfs
wait
yet
a
few
and
so
i
have
waited
saying
nothing
to
norah
and
max
but
i
want
to
be
in
the
midst
of
things
i
miss
the
sensation
of
having
my
fingers
at
the
pulse
of
the
big
old
world
i
lonely
for
the
noise
and
the
rush
and
the
hard
work
for
a
glimpse
of
the
busy
local
room
just
before
press
time
when
the
lights
are
swimming
in
a
smoky
haze
and
the
big
presses
downstairs
are
thundering
their
warning
to
hurry
and
the
men
are
breezing
in
from
their
runs
with
the
grist
of
news
that
will
be
ground
finer
and
finer
as
it
passes
through
the
mill
of
and
editors
hands
i
want
to
be
there
in
the
thick
of
the
confusion
that
is
after
all
so
orderly
i
want
to
be
there
when
the
telephone
bells
are
zinging
and
the
typewriters
are
snapping
and
the
messenger
boys
are
shuffling
in
and
out
and
the
office
kids
are
scuffling
in
a
corner
and
the
big
city
editor
collar
off
sleeves
rolled
up
from
his
great
arms
hair
bristling
wildly
above
his
green
is
swearing
gently
and
smoking
cigarette
after
cigarette
lighting
each
fresh
one
at
the
dying
glow
of
the
last
i
would
give
a
year
of
my
life
to
hear
him
say
i
do
mind
tellin
you
beatrice
fairfax
that
that
was
a
darn
good
story
you
got
on
the
millhaupt
divorce
the
other
fellows
have
a
word
that
is
all
of
which
is
most
unwomanly
for
is
not
marriage
woman
highest
aim
and
home
her
true
sphere
have
i
tried
both
i
ought
to
know
i
merely
have
been
miscast
in
this
life
drama
my
part
should
have
been
that
of
one
who
makes
her
way
alone
peter
with
his
thin
cruel
lips
and
his
shaking
hands
and
his
haggard
face
and
his
smoldering
eyes
is
a
shadow
forever
blotting
out
the
sunny
places
in
my
path
i
was
meant
to
be
an
old
maid
like
the
terrible
old
kitty
not
one
of
the
kind
but
an
impressive
bustling
old
girl
with
a
double
chin
the
kitty
used
to
say
that
being
an
old
maid
was
a
great
deal
like
death
by
drowning
a
really
delightful
sensation
when
you
ceased
struggling
norah
has
pleaded
with
me
to
be
more
like
other
women
of
my
age
and
for
her
sake
i
tried
she
has
led
me
about
to
bridge
parties
and
tea
fights
and
i
have
tried
to
act
as
though
i
were
enjoying
it
all
but
i
knew
that
i
was
getting
on
a
bit
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
one
year
of
newspapering
counts
for
two
years
of
ordinary
existence
and
that
while
i
in
the
family
bible
i
fully
forty
inside
when
one
day
may
bring
under
one
pen
a
priest
a
pauper
a
prostitute
a
philanthropist
each
with
a
story
to
tell
and
each
requiring
to
be
bullied
or
cajoled
or
bribed
or
threatened
or
tricked
into
telling
it
then
the
end
of
that
day
work
finds
one
looking
out
at
the
world
with
eyes
that
are
very
tired
and
as
old
as
the
world
itself
i
spoiled
for
sewing
bees
and
church
sociables
and
afternoon
bridges
a
hunger
for
the
city
is
upon
me
the
long
lazy
summer
days
have
slipped
by
there
is
an
autumn
tang
in
the
air
the
breeze
has
a
touch
that
is
sharp
winter
in
a
little
northern
town
i
should
go
mad
but
winter
in
the
city
the
streets
at
dusk
on
a
frosty
evening
the
shop
windows
arranged
by
artist
hands
for
the
eyes
of
women
the
rows
of
lights
like
jewels
strung
on
an
invisible
chain
the
glitter
of
brass
and
enamel
as
the
endless
procession
of
motors
flashes
past
the
women
the
nervous
men
the
shrill
note
of
the
crossing
policeman
whistle
every
wall
and
pillar
taking
on
a
mysterious
shadowy
beauty
in
the
purple
dusk
every
unsightly
blot
obscured
by
the
kindly
night
but
best
of
all
the
fascination
of
the
people
i
like
to
know
they
pop
up
now
and
then
in
the
shifting
crowds
and
are
gone
the
next
moment
leaving
behind
them
a
vague
regret
sometimes
i
call
them
the
people
i
like
to
know
and
sometimes
i
call
them
the
people
i
know
i
like
but
it
means
much
the
same
their
faces
flash
by
in
the
crowd
and
are
gone
but
i
recognize
them
instantly
as
belonging
to
my
beloved
circle
of
unknown
friends
once
it
was
a
girl
opposite
me
in
a
car
a
girl
with
a
wide
humorous
mouth
and
tragic
eyes
and
a
hole
in
her
shoe
once
it
was
a
big
homely
giant
of
a
man
with
an
engineering
magazine
sticking
out
of
his
coat
pocket
he
was
standing
at
a
book
counter
reading
dickens
like
a
schoolboy
and
laughing
in
all
the
right
places
i
know
because
i
peaked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
another
time
it
was
a
sprightly
little
grizzled
old
woman
staring
into
a
dazzling
shop
window
in
which
was
displayed
a
wonderful
collection
of
fashionably
impossible
hats
and
gowns
she
was
dressed
all
in
rusty
black
was
the
little
old
lady
and
she
had
a
quaint
cast
in
her
left
eye
that
gave
her
the
oddest
most
sporting
look
the
cast
was
working
overtime
as
she
gazed
at
the
gowns
and
the
ridiculous
old
sprigs
on
her
rusty
black
bonnet
trembled
with
her
silent
mirth
she
looked
like
one
of
those
clever
epigrammatic
dowdy
old
duchesses
that
one
reads
about
in
english
novels
i
sure
she
had
cardamon
seeds
in
her
shabby
bag
and
a
carriage
with
a
crest
on
it
waiting
for
her
just
around
the
corner
i
ached
to
slip
my
hand
through
her
arm
and
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
it
all
i
know
that
her
reply
would
have
been
exquisitely
witty
and
audacious
and
i
did
so
long
to
hear
her
say
it
no
doubt
some
good
angel
tugs
at
my
common
sense
restraining
me
from
doing
these
things
that
i
am
tempted
to
do
of
course
it
would
be
madness
for
a
woman
to
address
unknown
men
with
the
look
of
an
engineer
about
them
and
a
book
of
dickens
in
their
hands
or
perky
old
women
with
nutcracker
faces
or
girls
with
wide
humorous
mouths
oh
it
could
be
done
i
suppose
they
would
clap
me
in
a
padded
cell
in
no
time
if
i
were
to
say
mister
man
i
so
glad
your
heart
is
young
enough
for
dickens
i
love
him
too
enough
to
read
him
standing
at
a
book
counter
in
a
busy
shop
and
do
you
know
i
like
the
squareness
of
your
jaw
and
the
way
your
eyes
crinkle
up
when
you
laugh
and
as
for
your
being
an
engineer
why
one
of
the
very
first
men
i
ever
loved
was
the
engineer
in
of
fortune
i
wonder
what
the
girl
in
the
car
would
have
said
if
i
had
crossed
over
to
her
and
put
my
hand
on
her
arm
and
spoken
thus
girl
with
the
wide
humorous
mouth
and
the
tragic
eyes
and
the
hole
in
your
shoe
i
think
you
must
be
an
awfully
good
sort
i
wager
you
paint
or
write
or
act
or
do
something
clever
like
that
for
a
living
but
from
that
hole
in
your
shoe
which
you
have
inked
so
carefully
although
it
persists
in
showing
white
at
the
seams
i
fancy
you
are
stumbling
over
a
rather
stony
bit
of
life
road
just
now
and
from
the
look
in
your
eyes
girl
i
afraid
the
stones
have
cut
and
bruised
rather
cruelly
but
when
i
look
at
your
smiling
humorous
mouth
i
know
that
you
are
trying
to
laugh
at
the
hurts
i
think
that
this
morning
when
you
inked
your
shoe
for
the
dozenth
time
you
hesitated
between
tears
and
laughter
and
the
laugh
won
thank
god
please
keep
right
on
laughing
and
do
you
dare
stop
for
a
minute
because
pretty
soon
you
come
to
a
smooth
easy
place
and
then
wo
you
be
glad
that
you
did
give
up
to
lie
down
by
the
roadside
weary
of
your
hurts
oh
it
would
never
do
never
and
yet
no
charm
possessed
by
the
people
i
know
and
like
can
compare
with
the
fascination
of
those
people
i
like
to
know
and
know
i
would
like
here
at
home
with
norah
there
are
no
faces
in
the
crowds
there
are
no
crowds
when
you
turn
the
corner
at
main
street
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
will
see
the
same
people
in
the
same
places
you
know
that
mamie
hayes
will
be
flapping
her
duster
just
outside
the
door
of
the
jewelry
store
where
she
clerks
she
gazes
up
and
down
main
street
as
she
flaps
the
cloth
her
bright
eyes
keeping
a
sharp
watch
for
stray
traveling
men
that
may
chance
to
be
passing
you
know
that
there
will
be
the
same
lounging
group
of
youths
outside
the
briggs
patient
runabout
will
be
standing
at
his
office
doorway
outside
his
butcher
shop
assemblyman
schenck
will
be
holding
forth
on
the
subject
of
county
politics
to
a
group
of
badly
dressed
prosperous
looking
farmers
and
townsmen
and
as
he
talks
the
circle
of
brown
tobacco
juice
which
surrounds
the
group
closes
in
upon
them
nearer
and
nearer
and
there
in
a
roomy
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
public
library
reference
room
facing
the
big
front
window
you
will
see
old
man
randall
his
white
hair
forms
a
halo
above
his
pitiful
face
he
was
to
have
been
a
great
lawyer
was
old
man
randall
but
on
the
road
to
fame
he
met
drink
and
she
grasped
his
arm
and
led
him
down
and
into
crooked
lanes
and
finally
into
ditches
and
he
never
arrived
at
his
goal
there
in
that
library
window
nook
it
is
cool
in
summer
and
warm
in
winter
so
he
sits
and
dreams
holding
an
open
volume
unread
on
his
knees
some
times
he
writes
hunched
up
in
his
corner
feverishly
scribbling
at
ridiculous
plays
short
stories
and
novels
which
later
he
will
insist
on
reading
to
the
tittering
schoolboys
and
girls
who
come
into
the
library
to
do
their
courting
and
reference
work
presently
when
it
grows
dusk
old
man
randall
will
put
away
his
book
throw
his
coat
over
his
shoulders
sleeves
dangling
flowing
white
locks
sweeping
the
frayed
velvet
collar
he
will
march
out
with
his
soldierly
tread
humming
a
bit
of
a
tune
down
the
street
and
into
vandermeister
saloon
where
he
will
beg
a
drink
and
a
lunch
and
some
man
will
give
it
to
him
for
the
sake
of
what
old
man
randall
might
have
been
all
these
things
you
know
and
knowing
them
what
is
left
for
the
imagination
how
can
one
dream
dreams
about
people
when
one
knows
how
much
they
pay
their
hired
girl
and
what
they
have
for
dinner
on
wednesdays
chapter
the
absurd
becomes
serious
i
can
understand
the
emotions
of
a
war
horse
that
is
hitched
to
a
vegetable
wagon
i
am
going
to
milwaukee
to
work
it
is
a
thing
to
make
the
gods
hold
their
sides
and
roll
down
from
their
mountain
peaks
with
laughter
after
new
york
milwaukee
of
course
von
gerhard
is
to
blame
but
i
think
even
he
sees
the
humor
of
it
it
happened
in
this
way
on
a
day
when
i
was
indulging
in
a
particularly
fit
of
gloom
norah
rushed
into
my
room
i
think
i
was
mooning
over
some
old
papers
or
letters
or
ribbons
or
some
such
truck
in
the
charming
way
that
women
have
when
they
are
blue
out
wid
yez
cried
norah
on
with
your
hat
and
coat
i
just
had
a
wire
from
ernst
von
gerhard
he
coming
and
you
look
like
an
dill
pickle
you
are
half
as
blooming
as
when
he
was
here
in
august
and
this
is
october
get
out
and
walk
until
your
cheeks
are
so
red
that
von
gerhard
will
refuse
to
believe
that
this
puffing
bouncing
creature
is
the
green
and
limp
thing
that
huddled
in
a
chair
a
few
months
ago
out
ye
go
and
out
i
went
hatless
i
strode
countrywards
leaving
paved
streets
and
concrete
walks
far
behind
there
were
drifts
of
fallen
leaves
all
about
and
i
scuffled
through
them
drearily
trying
to
feel
gloomy
and
old
and
useless
and
failing
because
of
the
tang
in
the
air
and
the
wonder
of
the
leaves
and
the
regular
of
good
red
blood
that
was
coursing
through
my
body
as
per
norah
request
in
a
field
at
the
edge
of
the
town
just
where
city
and
country
begin
to
have
a
bowing
acquaintance
the
college
boys
were
at
football
practice
their
scarlet
sweaters
made
gay
patches
of
color
against
the
dull
of
the
autumn
grass
called
a
voice
there
followed
a
scuffle
a
creaking
of
leather
on
leather
a
thud
i
watched
them
a
bit
enviously
walking
backwards
until
a
twist
in
the
road
hid
them
from
view
that
same
twist
transformed
my
path
into
a
real
country
road
a
brown
dusty
monotonous
michigan
country
road
that
went
severely
about
its
business
never
once
stopping
to
flirt
with
the
blushing
autumn
woodland
at
its
left
or
to
dally
with
the
dimpling
ravine
at
its
right
now
if
that
were
an
english
country
road
thought
i
a
sociably
inclined
english
country
road
one
might
expect
something
of
it
on
an
english
country
road
this
would
be
the
psychological
moment
for
the
appearance
of
a
blond
god
in
gray
tweed
what
a
delightful
time
of
it
richard
le
gallienne
hero
had
on
his
quest
he
could
not
stroll
down
the
most
innocent
looking
lane
he
might
not
loiter
along
the
most
path
he
never
ambled
over
the
barest
piece
of
country
road
that
he
did
not
come
face
to
face
with
some
witty
and
lovely
woman
creature
also
in
search
of
things
unconventional
and
able
to
quote
charming
lines
from
chaucer
to
ah
but
that
was
england
and
this
is
america
i
realize
it
sadly
as
i
step
out
of
the
road
to
allow
a
yellow
milk
wagon
to
rattle
past
the
red
letters
on
the
yellow
milk
cart
inform
the
reader
that
it
is
the
property
of
august
schimmelpfennig
of
hickory
grove
the
schimmelpfennig
eye
may
be
seen
staring
down
upon
me
from
the
bit
of
glass
in
the
rear
as
the
cart
rattles
ahead
doubtless
being
suspicious
of
hatless
young
women
wandering
along
country
roads
at
dusk
alone
there
was
that
in
the
staring
eye
to
which
i
took
exception
it
wore
an
expression
which
made
me
feel
sure
that
the
mouth
below
it
was
all
if
i
could
but
have
seen
it
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
stared
at
by
the
fishy
schimmelpfennig
eye
but
to
be
grinned
at
by
the
schimmelpfennig
mouth
i
resented
it
in
order
to
show
my
resentment
i
turned
my
back
on
the
schimmelpfennig
cart
and
pretended
to
look
up
the
road
which
i
had
just
traveled
i
pretended
to
look
up
the
road
and
then
i
did
look
in
earnest
no
wonder
the
schimmelpfennig
eye
and
mouth
had
worn
the
leering
expression
the
blond
god
in
gray
tweed
was
swinging
along
toward
me
i
knew
that
he
was
blond
because
he
wore
no
hat
and
the
last
rays
of
the
october
sun
were
making
a
little
halo
effect
about
his
head
i
knew
that
his
gray
clothes
were
tweed
because
every
well
regulated
hero
on
a
country
road
wears
tweed
it
almost
a
religion
with
them
he
was
not
near
enough
to
make
a
glance
at
his
features
possible
i
turned
around
and
continued
my
walk
the
yellow
cart
with
its
impudent
schimmelpfennig
leer
was
disappearing
in
a
cloud
of
dust
shades
of
the
duchess
and
bertha
clay
how
does
one
greet
a
blond
god
in
gray
tweed
on
a
country
road
when
one
has
him
the
blond
god
solved
the
problem
for
me
hi
he
called
i
did
not
turn
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
there
came
a
shrill
insistent
whistle
of
the
kind
that
is
made
by
placing
four
fingers
between
the
teeth
it
is
a
favorite
with
the
gallery
gods
i
would
not
have
believed
that
gray
tweed
gods
stooped
to
it
hi
called
the
voice
again
very
near
now
lieber
gott
never
have
i
seen
so
proud
a
young
woman
i
whirled
about
to
face
von
gerhard
a
strangely
boyish
and
unprofessional
looking
von
gerhard
young
man
i
said
severely
have
you
been
of
me
for
miles
groaned
he
as
we
shook
hands
you
walk
like
a
grenadier
i
am
sent
by
the
charming
norah
to
tell
you
that
you
are
to
come
home
to
mix
the
salad
dressing
for
there
is
company
for
supper
i
am
the
i
was
still
a
bit
dazed
but
how
did
you
know
which
road
to
take
and
when
wunderbar
nicht
wahr
laughed
von
gerhard
but
really
quite
simple
i
come
in
on
an
earlier
train
than
i
had
expected
chat
a
moment
with
sister
norah
inquire
after
the
health
of
my
patient
and
am
told
that
she
is
running
away
from
a
horde
of
blue
devils
quote
your
charming
sister
that
have
swarmed
about
her
all
day
what
direction
did
her
flight
take
i
ask
sister
norah
shrugs
her
shoulders
and
presumes
that
it
is
the
road
which
shows
the
reddest
and
yellowest
autumn
colors
that
road
will
be
your
road
so
pooh
how
simple
that
is
the
second
disappointment
you
have
given
me
but
how
is
that
possible
the
first
has
not
had
time
to
the
first
was
yourself
i
replied
rudely
i
had
been
longing
for
an
adventure
and
when
i
saw
you
up
the
road
such
an
unusual
figure
for
our
michigan
country
roads
i
forgot
that
i
was
a
disappointed
old
grass
widder
with
a
history
and
i
grew
young
again
and
my
heart
jumped
up
into
my
throat
and
i
sez
to
mesilf
sez
i
the
hero
and
it
was
only
von
gerhard
stared
a
moment
a
curious
look
on
his
face
then
he
laughed
one
of
those
rare
laughs
of
his
and
i
joined
him
because
i
was
strangely
young
light
and
happy
to
be
alive
you
walk
and
enjoy
walking
yes
asked
von
gerhard
scanning
my
face
your
cheeks
they
are
like
well
as
unlike
the
cheeks
of
the
german
girls
as
diana
are
unlike
a
dairy
maid
and
the
nerfs
they
no
longer
jump
eh
oh
they
jump
but
not
with
weariness
they
jump
to
get
into
action
again
from
a
life
of
too
much
excitement
i
have
gone
to
the
other
extreme
i
shall
be
dead
of
ennui
in
another
six
ennui
mused
he
and
you
are
how
is
it
years
yes
h
there
was
a
world
of
exasperation
in
the
last
exclamation
i
am
a
thousand
years
old
it
made
me
exclaim
a
million
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
are
sixteen
declared
von
gerhard
calmly
we
had
come
to
a
fork
in
the
road
at
the
right
the
narrower
road
ran
between
two
rows
of
great
maples
that
made
an
arch
of
golden
splendor
the
frost
had
kissed
them
into
a
gorgeous
radiance
sunshine
avenue
announced
von
gerhard
it
beckons
us
away
from
home
and
supper
and
salad
dressing
and
duty
but
who
knows
what
we
shall
find
at
the
end
of
it
let
explore
i
suggested
it
is
splendidly
golden
enough
to
be
we
entered
the
yellow
canopied
pathway
let
us
pretend
this
is
germany
yes
pleaded
von
gerhard
this
golden
pathway
will
end
in
a
neat
little
restaurant
with
tables
and
chairs
outside
and
comfortable
german
papas
and
mammas
and
children
sitting
at
the
tables
drinking
coffee
or
beer
there
will
be
stout
waiters
and
a
host
and
we
will
seat
ourselves
at
one
of
the
tables
and
i
will
wave
my
hand
and
one
of
the
stout
waiters
will
come
flying
you
have
coffee
or
beer
it
sounds
prosaic
but
it
is
very
very
good
as
you
will
see
pathways
in
germany
always
end
in
coffee
and
kuchen
and
waiters
in
white
but
oh
no
i
exclaimed
for
his
mood
was
infectious
this
is
france
please
the
golden
pathway
will
end
in
a
picturesque
little
french
farm
with
a
dairy
and
in
the
doorway
of
the
farmhouse
there
will
be
a
peasant
woman
with
a
white
cap
and
a
baby
on
her
arm
and
sabots
oh
surely
she
will
wear
sabots
most
certainly
she
will
wear
sabots
von
gerhard
said
heatedly
and
blue
knitted
stockings
and
the
baby
name
is
mimi
we
had
taken
hands
and
were
skipping
down
the
pathway
now
like
two
excited
children
let
run
i
suggested
and
run
we
did
like
two
mad
creatures
until
we
rounded
a
gentle
curve
and
brought
up
panting
within
a
foot
of
a
decrepit
rail
fence
the
rail
fence
enclosed
a
stubbly
lumpy
field
the
field
was
inhabited
by
an
inquiring
cow
von
gerhard
and
i
stood
quite
still
hand
in
hand
gazing
at
the
cow
then
we
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
each
other
this
pathway
of
glorified
maples
ends
in
a
cow
i
said
solemnly
at
which
we
both
shrieked
with
mirth
leaning
on
the
decrepit
fence
and
mopping
our
eyes
with
our
handkerchiefs
did
i
not
say
you
were
sixteen
taunted
von
gerhard
we
were
getting
surprisingly
well
acquainted
such
a
scolding
as
we
shall
get
it
will
be
quite
dark
before
we
are
home
norah
will
be
tearing
her
it
was
a
true
prophecy
as
we
stampeded
up
the
steps
the
door
was
flung
open
disclosing
a
tragic
figure
such
a
steak
wailed
norah
and
it
has
been
done
for
hours
and
hours
and
now
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
fried
ear
where
have
you
two
driveling
idiots
been
and
mushrooms
she
means
that
the
ruined
steak
was
further
enhanced
by
mushrooms
i
explained
in
response
to
von
gerhard
bewildered
look
we
marched
into
the
house
trying
not
to
appear
like
sneak
thieves
max
pipe
in
mouth
surveyed
us
blandly
fine
color
you
got
dawn
he
remarked
there
is
such
a
thing
as
overdoing
this
health
business
snapped
norah
with
a
great
deal
of
acidity
for
her
i
did
tell
you
to
make
them
purple
you
max
turned
to
von
gerhard
now
what
does
she
mean
by
that
do
you
suppose
eh
ernst
softly
brother
softly
whispered
von
gerhard
when
women
exchange
remarks
that
apparently
are
simple
and
yet
that
you
a
man
can
not
understand
then
know
there
is
a
woman
war
going
on
and
step
softly
and
hold
your
peace
aber
ruhig
calm
was
restored
with
the
appearance
of
the
steak
which
was
found
to
have
survived
the
period
of
waiting
and
to
be
incredibly
juicy
and
tender
presently
we
were
all
settled
once
more
in
the
great
beamed
living
room
sis
at
the
piano
the
two
men
smoking
their
cigars
with
that
idiotic
expression
of
contentment
which
always
adorns
the
masculine
face
on
such
occasions
i
looked
at
them
at
those
three
who
had
done
so
much
for
my
happiness
and
well
being
and
something
within
me
said
now
speak
now
norah
was
playing
very
softly
so
that
the
spalpeens
upstairs
might
not
be
disturbed
i
took
a
long
breath
and
made
the
plunge
norah
if
you
continue
the
slow
music
i
be
much
obliged
time
has
come
the
walrus
said
to
talk
of
many
things
do
be
absurd
said
norah
over
her
shoulder
and
went
on
playing
i
never
was
more
serious
in
my
life
good
folkses
all
i
got
to
be
this
butterfly
existence
has
gone
on
long
enough
norah
and
max
and
mr
doctor
man
i
am
going
norah
hands
crashed
down
on
the
piano
keys
with
a
jangling
discord
she
swung
about
to
face
me
not
new
york
again
dawn
not
new
york
i
am
afraid
so
i
answered
max
bless
his
great
brotherly
heart
rose
and
came
over
to
me
and
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
do
you
like
it
here
girlie
want
to
be
hauled
home
on
a
shutter
again
do
you
you
know
that
as
long
as
we
have
a
home
you
have
one
we
need
you
but
i
shook
my
head
from
his
chair
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
could
feel
von
gerhard
gaze
fixed
upon
us
he
had
said
nothing
need
me
no
one
needs
me
do
worry
i
not
going
to
become
maudlin
about
it
but
i
do
belong
here
and
you
know
it
i
have
my
work
to
do
norah
is
the
best
sister
that
a
woman
ever
had
and
max
an
angel
but
how
can
i
stay
on
here
and
keep
my
i
took
max
big
hand
in
mine
and
gathered
courage
from
it
but
you
have
been
working
wailed
norah
every
morning
and
i
thought
the
book
was
coming
on
beautifully
and
i
sure
it
will
be
a
wonderful
book
dawn
dear
you
are
so
oh
the
book
it
is
too
uncertain
perhaps
it
will
go
but
perhaps
it
wo
and
then
what
it
will
be
months
before
the
book
is
properly
polished
off
and
then
i
may
peddle
it
around
for
more
months
no
i
ca
afford
to
trifle
with
uncertainties
every
newspaper
man
or
woman
writes
a
book
it
like
having
the
measles
there
is
not
a
newspaper
man
living
who
does
not
believe
in
his
heart
that
if
he
could
only
take
a
month
or
two
away
from
the
telegraph
desk
or
the
police
run
he
could
write
the
book
of
the
year
not
to
speak
of
the
great
american
play
why
just
look
at
me
i
only
been
writing
seriously
for
a
few
weeks
and
already
the
best
magazines
in
the
country
are
refusing
my
manuscripts
do
joke
said
norah
coming
over
to
me
i
ca
stand
why
not
much
better
than
weeping
is
it
and
anyway
i
no
subject
for
tears
any
more
von
gerhard
will
tell
you
how
well
and
strong
i
am
wo
you
herr
doktor
well
said
von
gerhard
in
his
careful
deliberate
english
since
you
ask
me
i
should
say
that
you
might
last
about
one
year
in
new
there
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
norah
what
utter
blither
i
scoffed
turning
to
glare
at
von
gerhard
gently
warned
max
such
disrespect
to
the
man
who
pulled
you
back
from
the
edge
of
the
yawning
grave
only
six
months
ago
yawning
fiddlesticks
snapped
i
elegantly
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
me
except
that
i
wanted
to
be
fussed
over
and
i
have
been
and
i
loved
it
but
it
must
stop
i
rose
and
walked
over
to
the
table
and
faced
von
gerhard
sitting
there
in
the
depths
of
a
great
chair
you
do
not
seem
to
realize
that
i
am
not
free
to
come
and
go
and
work
and
play
and
laugh
and
live
like
other
women
there
is
my
living
to
make
and
there
is
peter
orme
do
you
think
that
i
could
stay
on
here
like
this
oh
i
know
that
max
is
not
a
poor
man
but
he
is
not
a
rich
man
either
and
there
are
the
children
to
be
educated
and
besides
max
married
norah
not
the
whole
tribe
i
want
to
go
to
work
i
am
not
a
free
woman
but
when
i
am
working
i
forget
and
am
almost
happy
i
tell
you
i
must
be
well
again
i
will
be
well
i
am
well
at
the
end
of
which
dramatic
period
i
spoiled
the
whole
effect
by
bowing
my
head
on
the
table
and
giving
way
to
a
fit
of
weeping
such
as
i
had
not
had
since
the
days
of
my
illness
looks
like
it
said
max
at
which
i
decided
to
laugh
and
the
situation
was
saved
it
was
then
that
von
gerhard
proposed
the
thing
that
set
us
staring
at
him
in
amused
wonder
he
came
over
and
stood
looking
down
at
us
his
hands
outspread
upon
the
big
library
table
his
body
bent
forward
in
an
attitude
of
eager
intentness
i
remember
thinking
what
wonderful
hands
they
were
true
indexes
of
the
man
character
broad
white
surgeonly
hands
the
fingers
almost
square
at
the
tips
they
were
hands
as
different
from
those
slender
nervous
unsteady
womanly
hands
of
peter
orme
as
any
hands
could
be
i
thought
they
were
hands
made
for
work
that
called
for
delicate
strength
if
such
a
paradox
could
be
hands
to
cling
to
to
gain
courage
from
hands
that
spelled
power
and
reserve
i
looked
at
them
fascinated
as
i
often
had
done
before
and
thought
that
i
never
had
seen
such
sane
hands
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
include
me
in
this
little
family
conclave
began
ernst
von
gerhard
i
am
going
to
take
advantage
of
your
trust
i
shall
give
you
some
advice
a
thing
i
usually
keep
for
unpleasant
professional
occasions
do
not
go
back
to
new
but
i
know
new
york
and
new
york
the
newspaper
part
of
it
knows
me
where
else
can
i
go
you
have
your
book
to
finish
you
could
never
finish
it
there
is
it
not
so
i
afraid
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
was
all
so
much
harder
than
i
had
expected
what
did
they
want
me
to
do
i
asked
myself
bitterly
von
gerhard
went
on
why
not
go
where
the
newspaper
work
will
not
be
so
where
you
still
might
find
time
for
this
other
work
that
is
dear
to
you
and
that
may
bring
its
reward
in
he
reached
out
and
took
my
hand
into
his
great
steady
clasp
come
to
the
happy
healthy
german
town
called
milwaukee
yes
ach
you
may
laugh
but
newspaper
work
is
newspaper
work
the
world
over
because
men
and
women
are
just
men
and
women
the
world
over
but
there
you
could
live
sanely
and
work
not
too
hard
and
there
would
be
spare
hours
for
the
book
that
is
near
your
heart
and
i
i
will
speak
of
you
to
norberg
of
the
post
and
on
sundays
if
you
are
good
i
may
take
you
along
the
marvelous
lake
drives
in
my
little
red
runabout
yes
aber
wunderbar
those
drives
are
then
milwaukee
shrieked
max
and
norah
and
i
together
after
new
york
milwaukee
laugh
said
von
gerhard
quite
composedly
i
give
you
until
morning
to
stop
laughing
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
will
not
seem
quite
so
amusing
no
joke
is
so
funny
after
one
has
contemplated
it
for
twelve
the
voice
of
norah
the
temptress
sounded
close
to
my
ear
dawn
dear
just
think
how
many
million
miles
nearer
you
would
be
to
max
and
me
and
oh
you
have
all
gone
mad
the
thing
is
impossible
i
sha
go
back
to
a
country
sheet
in
my
old
age
i
suppose
that
in
two
more
years
i
shall
be
editing
a
mothers
column
on
an
agricultural
norberg
would
be
delighted
to
get
you
mused
von
gerhard
and
it
would
be
day
work
instead
of
night
and
you
would
send
me
a
weekly
bulletin
on
dawn
health
would
you
ernst
pleaded
norah
and
you
teach
her
to
drink
beer
and
she
shall
grow
so
fat
that
the
spalpeens
wo
know
their
at
last
how
much
do
they
pay
i
asked
in
desperation
and
the
thing
that
had
appeared
so
absurd
at
first
began
to
take
on
the
shape
of
reality
von
gerhard
did
speak
to
norberg
of
the
post
and
i
am
to
go
to
milwaukee
next
week
the
skeleton
of
the
book
manuscript
is
stowed
safely
away
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
and
norah
has
filled
in
the
remaining
space
with
sundry
flannels
and
hot
water
bags
and
medicine
flasks
so
that
i
feel
like
a
schoolgirl
on
her
way
to
instead
of
like
a
seasoned
old
newspaper
woman
with
a
capital
past
and
a
shaky
future
i
wish
that
i
were
chummier
with
the
irish
saints
i
need
them
now
chapter
vi
steeped
in
german
i
am
living
at
a
little
private
hotel
just
across
from
the
court
house
square
with
its
scarlet
geraniums
and
its
pretty
fountain
the
house
is
filled
with
german
civil
engineers
mechanical
engineers
and
herr
professors
from
the
german
academy
on
sunday
mornings
we
have
pfannkuchen
with
currant
jelly
and
the
herr
professors
come
down
to
breakfast
in
fearful
flappy
german
slippers
i
the
only
creature
in
the
place
that
is
just
over
from
germany
even
the
dog
is
a
dachshund
it
is
so
unbelievable
that
every
day
or
two
i
go
down
to
wisconsin
street
and
gaze
at
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
the
government
building
in
order
to
convince
myself
that
this
is
america
it
needs
only
a
kaiser
or
so
and
a
bit
of
unter
den
linden
to
be
quite
complete
the
little
private
hotel
is
kept
by
herr
and
frau
knapf
after
one
has
seen
them
one
quite
understands
why
the
place
is
steeped
in
a
german
atmosphere
up
to
its
eyebrows
i
never
would
have
found
it
myself
it
was
doctor
von
gerhard
who
had
suggested
knapf
and
who
had
paved
the
way
for
my
coming
here
you
will
find
it
quite
unlike
anything
you
have
ever
tried
before
he
warned
me
very
german
it
is
and
very
very
clean
and
most
inexpensive
also
i
think
you
will
find
material
there
how
is
it
you
call
it
copy
yes
well
there
should
be
copy
in
plenty
and
types
but
you
shall
from
the
moment
i
rang
the
knapf
doorbell
i
saw
the
dapper
cheerful
herr
knapf
wearing
a
disappointed
kaiser
wilhelm
mustache
opened
the
door
i
scarcely
had
begun
to
make
my
wishes
known
when
he
interrupted
with
a
large
wave
of
the
hand
and
an
elaborate
german
bow
ach
yes
you
would
be
the
lady
of
whom
the
herr
doktor
has
spoken
gewiss
frau
orme
not
but
so
a
young
lady
i
did
not
expect
to
see
a
room
we
have
saved
for
you
aber
wunderhubsch
it
makes
me
much
pleasure
to
show
folgen
sie
mir
you
you
speak
english
i
faltered
with
visions
of
my
evenings
spent
in
expressing
myself
in
the
sign
language
englisch
but
yes
here
in
milwaukee
it
gives
aber
mostly
german
and
then
too
i
have
been
only
twenty
years
in
this
country
and
always
in
milwaukee
here
is
it
gemutlich
and
mostly
it
gives
i
tried
not
to
look
frightened
and
followed
him
up
to
the
but
wonderfully
beautiful
room
to
my
joy
i
found
it
airy
and
huge
with
a
great
vault
of
a
clothes
closet
bristling
with
hooks
and
boasting
an
unbelievable
number
of
shelves
my
trunk
was
swallowed
up
in
it
never
in
all
my
experience
have
i
seen
such
a
room
or
such
a
closet
the
closet
must
have
been
built
for
a
trousseau
in
the
days
of
and
scuttle
bonnets
there
was
a
separate
and
distinct
hook
for
each
and
every
one
of
my
most
obscure
garments
i
tried
to
spread
them
out
i
used
two
hooks
to
every
petticoat
and
three
for
my
kimono
and
when
i
had
finished
there
were
rows
of
hooks
to
spare
tiers
of
shelves
yawned
for
which
i
possessed
not
bluebeard
wives
could
have
held
a
family
reunion
in
that
closet
and
invited
all
of
solomon
spouses
finally
in
desperation
i
gathered
all
my
poor
garments
together
and
hung
them
in
a
sociable
bunch
on
the
hooks
nearest
the
door
how
i
should
have
loved
to
have
shown
that
closet
to
a
select
circle
of
new
york
landladies
after
wrestling
in
vain
with
the
forest
of
hooks
i
turned
my
attention
to
my
room
i
yanked
a
towel
thing
off
the
center
table
and
replaced
it
with
a
scarf
that
peter
had
picked
up
in
the
orient
i
set
up
my
typewriter
in
a
corner
near
a
window
and
dug
a
gay
cushion
or
two
and
a
out
of
my
trunk
i
distributed
photographs
of
norah
and
max
and
the
spalpeens
separately
in
couples
and
in
groups
then
i
bounced
up
and
down
in
a
huge
yellow
brocade
chair
and
found
it
unbelievably
soft
and
comfortable
of
course
i
reflected
after
the
big
veranda
and
the
apple
tree
at
norah
and
the
comfort
of
her
library
and
the
charming
tones
of
her
oriental
rugs
and
hangings
oh
stop
your
carping
dawn
i
told
myself
you
ca
expect
charming
tones
and
oriental
and
apple
trees
in
a
german
anyhow
there
running
water
in
the
room
for
general
utility
purposes
that
better
than
a
pink
prayer
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
that
it
was
the
luxuries
that
made
life
worth
living
that
was
in
the
old
bohemian
days
necessities
i
used
to
laugh
pooh
who
cares
about
the
necessities
what
if
the
dishpan
does
leak
it
is
the
luxuries
that
bohemia
and
luxuries
half
a
dozen
lean
years
have
steered
me
safely
past
that
after
such
a
course
in
common
sense
you
do
stand
back
and
examine
the
pictures
of
a
pink
moses
in
a
nest
of
purple
bullrushes
or
complain
because
the
bureau
does
not
harmonize
with
the
wall
paper
neither
do
you
criticize
the
blue
and
saffron
roses
that
form
the
rug
pattern
not
instead
you
warily
punch
the
mattress
to
see
if
it
is
and
you
snoop
into
the
clothes
closet
you
inquire
the
distance
to
the
nearest
bath
room
and
whether
the
payments
are
weekly
or
monthly
and
if
there
is
a
baby
in
the
room
next
door
oh
there
nothing
like
living
in
a
for
cultivating
the
materialistic
side
but
i
was
to
find
that
here
at
knapf
things
were
quite
different
not
only
was
ernst
von
gerhard
right
in
saying
that
it
was
very
german
and
very
very
clean
he
recognized
good
copy
when
he
saw
it
types
i
never
dreamed
that
such
faces
existed
outside
of
the
old
german
woodcuts
that
one
sees
illustrating
books
i
had
thought
myself
hardened
to
strange
dining
rooms
with
their
batteries
of
cold
critical
women
eyes
i
had
learned
to
walk
unruffled
in
the
face
of
the
most
carping
suspicious
and
the
fishiest
of
these
batteries
therefore
on
my
first
day
at
knapf
i
went
down
to
dinner
in
the
evening
quite
composed
and
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
my
collar
was
clean
and
that
there
was
no
flaw
to
find
in
the
fit
of
my
skirt
in
the
back
as
i
opened
the
door
of
my
room
i
heard
sounds
as
of
a
violent
altercation
in
progress
downstairs
i
leaned
over
the
balusters
and
listened
the
sounds
rose
and
fell
and
swelled
and
boomed
they
were
german
sounds
that
started
in
the
throat
gutturally
and
spluttered
their
way
up
they
were
sounds
such
as
i
had
not
heard
since
the
night
i
was
sent
to
cover
a
socialist
meeting
in
new
york
i
down
the
stairs
although
i
might
have
fallen
down
and
landed
with
a
thud
without
having
been
heard
the
din
came
from
the
direction
of
the
dining
room
well
come
what
might
i
would
not
falter
after
all
it
could
not
be
worse
than
that
awful
time
when
i
had
helped
cover
the
strike
i
peered
into
the
dining
room
the
thunder
of
conversation
went
on
as
before
but
there
was
no
bloodshed
nothing
but
men
and
women
sitting
at
small
tables
eating
and
talking
when
i
say
eating
and
talking
i
do
not
mean
that
those
acts
were
carried
on
separately
not
at
all
the
eating
and
the
talking
went
on
simultaneously
neither
interrupting
the
other
a
fork
full
of
food
and
a
mouthful
of
german
words
met
wrestled
and
passed
one
another
unscathed
i
stood
in
the
doorway
fascinated
until
herr
knapf
spied
me
took
a
nimble
skip
in
my
direction
twisted
the
discouraged
mustaches
into
temporary
sprightliness
and
waved
me
toward
a
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
then
a
frightful
thing
happened
when
i
think
of
it
now
i
turn
cold
the
battery
was
not
that
of
women
eyes
but
of
men
and
conversation
ceased
the
uproar
and
the
booming
of
vowels
was
hushed
the
silence
was
appalling
i
looked
up
in
horror
to
find
that
what
seemed
to
be
millions
of
staring
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
the
stillness
was
so
thick
that
you
could
cut
it
with
a
knife
such
men
immediately
i
dubbed
them
the
aborigines
and
prayed
that
i
might
find
adjectives
with
which
to
describe
their
foreheads
it
appeared
that
the
aborigines
were
especially
favored
in
that
they
were
all
placed
at
one
long
untidy
table
at
the
head
of
the
room
the
rest
of
us
sat
at
small
tables
later
i
learned
that
they
were
all
engineers
at
meals
they
discuss
engineering
problems
in
the
most
german
after
supper
they
smoke
impossible
german
pipes
and
dozens
of
cigarettes
they
have
bulging
knobby
foreheads
and
bristling
pompadours
and
some
of
the
rawest
of
them
wear
beards
and
thick
spectacles
and
cravats
and
trousers
that
lew
fields
never
even
dreamed
of
they
are
all
graduates
of
foreign
universities
and
are
horribly
learned
and
brilliant
but
they
are
the
worst
mannered
lot
i
ever
saw
in
the
silence
that
followed
my
entrance
a
maid
approached
me
and
asked
what
i
would
have
for
supper
supper
i
asked
was
not
dinner
served
in
the
evening
the
aborigines
nudged
each
other
and
sniggered
like
fiendish
little
the
maid
looked
at
me
pityingly
dinner
was
served
in
the
middle
of
the
day
naturlich
for
supper
there
was
wienerschnitzel
and
kalter
aufschnitt
also
kartoffel
salat
and
fresh
kaffeekuchen
the
room
hung
breathless
on
my
decision
i
wrestled
with
a
horrible
desire
to
shriek
and
run
instead
i
managed
to
mumble
an
order
the
aborigines
turned
to
one
another
inquiringly
was
hat
sie
gesagt
they
asked
what
did
she
say
whereupon
they
fell
to
discussing
my
hair
and
teeth
and
eyes
and
complexion
in
german
as
crammed
with
adjectives
as
was
the
rye
bread
over
which
i
was
choking
with
caraway
the
entire
table
watched
me
with
unabashed
interest
while
i
ate
and
i
advanced
by
quick
stages
from
confusion
to
purple
mirth
it
appeared
that
my
presence
was
the
ground
for
a
heavy
german
joke
in
connection
with
the
youngest
of
the
aborigines
he
was
a
very
plump
and
greasy
looking
aborigine
with
a
rosiness
of
cheek
and
a
scared
and
bristling
pompadour
and
very
small
the
other
aborigines
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
roared
ai
fritz
jetzt
brauchst
du
nicht
zu
weinen
deine
lena
war
aber
nicht
so
huebsch
eh
later
i
learned
that
fritz
was
the
newest
arrival
and
that
since
coming
to
this
country
he
had
been
rather
low
in
spirits
in
consequence
of
a
certain
lena
whom
he
had
left
behind
in
the
fatherland
an
examination
of
the
dining
room
and
its
other
occupants
served
to
keep
my
mind
off
the
hateful
long
table
the
dining
room
was
a
double
one
the
floor
carpetless
and
clean
there
was
a
little
platform
at
one
end
with
plants
in
pots
near
the
windows
the
wall
was
ornamented
with
very
german
pictures
of
very
plump
german
girls
being
chucked
under
the
chin
by
very
dashing
mustachioed
german
lieutenants
it
was
all
very
bare
and
strange
and
foreign
to
my
eyes
and
yet
there
was
something
bright
and
comfortable
about
it
i
felt
that
i
was
going
to
like
it
aborigines
and
all
the
men
drink
beer
with
their
supper
and
read
the
and
the
germania
and
foreign
papers
that
i
never
heard
of
it
is
uncanny
in
these
united
states
but
it
is
going
to
be
bully
for
my
german
after
my
first
letter
home
norah
wrote
frantically
demanding
to
know
if
i
was
the
only
woman
in
the
house
i
calmed
her
fears
by
assuring
her
that
while
the
men
were
interesting
and
ugly
with
the
fascinating
ugliness
of
a
bulldog
the
women
were
crushed
looking
and
uninteresting
and
wore
hopeless
hats
i
have
written
norah
and
max
reams
about
this
household
from
the
aborigines
to
minna
who
tidies
my
room
and
serves
my
meals
and
admires
my
clothes
minna
is
related
to
frau
knapf
whom
i
have
never
seen
minna
is
inordinately
fond
of
dress
and
her
remarks
anent
my
own
garments
are
apt
to
be
a
trifle
disconcerting
especially
when
she
intersperses
her
recital
of
dinner
dishes
with
admiring
adjectives
directed
at
my
blouse
or
hat
thus
wir
haben
roast
beef
und
spareribs
mit
sauerkraut
und
schicken
ach
wie
schon
frau
orme
aber
ganz
prachtvoll
her
eyes
and
hands
are
raised
toward
heaven
what
prachtful
i
ask
startled
the
chicken
nein
your
waist
selbst
gemacht
i
am
even
becoming
hardened
to
the
manners
of
the
aborigines
it
used
to
fuss
me
to
death
to
meet
one
of
them
in
the
halls
they
always
stopped
short
brought
heels
together
with
a
click
bent
stiffly
from
the
waist
and
thundered
nabben
fraulein
i
have
learned
to
take
the
salutation
quite
calmly
and
even
the
wildest
most
spectacled
and
aborigine
can
not
startle
me
nonchalantly
i
reply
nabben
and
wish
that
norah
could
but
see
me
in
the
act
when
i
told
ernst
von
gerhard
about
them
he
laughed
a
little
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
na
you
should
not
look
so
young
and
so
pretty
and
so
unmarried
in
germany
a
married
woman
brushes
her
hair
quite
smoothly
back
and
pins
it
in
a
hard
knob
and
she
knows
nothing
of
such
bewildering
collars
and
fluffy
frilled
things
in
the
front
of
the
blouse
how
do
you
call
them
jabots
von
gerhard
has
not
behaved
at
all
nicely
i
did
not
see
him
until
two
weeks
after
my
arrival
in
milwaukee
although
he
telephoned
twice
to
ask
if
there
was
anything
that
he
could
do
to
make
me
comfortable
yes
i
had
answered
the
last
time
that
i
heard
his
voice
over
the
telephone
it
would
be
a
whole
heap
of
comfort
to
me
just
to
see
you
you
are
the
nearest
thing
to
norah
that
there
is
in
this
whole
german
town
and
goodness
knows
you
far
from
he
came
the
weather
had
turned
suddenly
cold
and
he
was
wearing
a
coat
with
a
collar
of
fur
he
looked
most
amazingly
handsome
and
blond
and
splendidly
healthy
the
clasp
of
his
hands
was
just
as
big
and
sure
as
ever
you
have
no
idea
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
told
him
if
you
had
you
would
have
been
here
days
ago
are
you
rather
and
neglectful
considering
that
you
are
responsible
for
my
being
here
i
did
not
know
whether
you
a
married
woman
would
care
to
have
me
here
he
said
in
his
composed
way
in
a
place
like
this
people
are
not
always
kind
enough
to
take
the
trouble
to
understand
and
i
would
not
have
them
raise
their
eyebrows
at
you
not
for
married
i
laughed
some
imp
of
willfulness
seizing
me
i
not
married
what
mockery
to
say
that
i
am
married
simply
because
i
must
write
madam
before
my
name
i
am
not
married
and
i
shall
talk
to
whom
i
and
then
von
gerhard
did
a
surprising
thing
he
took
two
great
steps
over
to
my
chair
and
grasped
my
hands
and
pulled
me
to
my
feet
i
stared
up
at
him
like
a
silly
creature
his
face
was
suffused
with
a
dull
red
and
his
eyes
were
unbelievably
blue
and
bright
he
had
my
hands
in
his
great
grip
but
his
voice
was
very
quiet
and
contained
you
are
married
he
said
never
forget
that
for
a
moment
you
are
bound
hard
and
fast
and
tight
and
you
are
for
no
man
you
are
married
as
much
as
though
that
poor
creature
in
the
mad
house
were
here
working
for
you
instead
of
the
case
being
reversed
as
it
is
what
do
you
mean
i
cried
wrenching
myself
away
indignantly
what
right
have
you
to
talk
to
me
like
this
you
know
what
my
life
has
been
and
how
i
have
tried
to
smile
with
my
lips
and
stay
young
in
my
heart
i
thought
you
understood
norah
thought
so
too
and
max
i
do
understand
i
understand
so
well
that
i
would
not
have
you
talk
as
you
did
a
moment
ago
and
i
said
what
i
said
not
so
much
for
your
sake
as
for
mine
for
see
i
too
must
remember
that
you
write
madam
before
your
name
and
sometimes
it
is
hard
for
me
to
oh
i
said
like
a
simpleton
and
stood
staring
after
him
as
he
quietly
gathered
up
his
hat
and
gloves
and
left
me
standing
there
chapter
vii
blackie
philosophy
i
did
not
write
norah
about
von
gerhard
after
all
i
told
myself
there
was
nothing
to
write
and
so
i
was
the
first
to
break
the
solemn
pact
that
we
had
made
you
will
write
everything
wo
you
dawn
dear
norah
had
pleaded
with
tears
in
her
pretty
eyes
promise
me
we
been
nearer
to
each
other
in
these
last
few
months
than
we
have
been
since
we
were
girls
and
i
loved
it
so
please
do
do
as
you
did
during
those
miserable
years
in
new
york
when
you
were
fighting
your
troubles
alone
and
we
knew
nothing
of
it
you
wrote
only
the
happy
things
promise
me
write
the
unhappy
ones
too
though
the
saints
forbid
that
there
should
be
any
to
write
and
dawn
do
you
dare
to
forget
your
heavy
underwear
in
november
those
lake
breezes
well
some
one
has
to
tell
you
and
i
ca
leave
those
to
von
gerhard
he
has
promised
to
act
as
monitor
over
your
and
so
i
promised
i
crammed
my
letters
with
descriptions
of
the
knapf
household
i
assured
her
that
i
was
putting
on
so
much
weight
that
the
skirts
which
formerly
hung
about
me
in
limp
dejected
folds
now
refused
to
meet
in
the
back
and
all
the
hooks
and
eyes
were
making
faces
at
each
other
my
cheeks
i
told
her
looked
as
if
i
were
wearing
plumpers
and
i
was
beginning
to
waddle
and
puff
as
i
walked
norah
made
frantic
answer
for
mercy
sake
child
be
careful
or
you
be
fat
to
which
i
replied
do
care
if
i
am
rather
be
hunky
and
healthy
than
skinny
and
sick
have
tried
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
becoming
when
one
is
working
on
a
paper
that
allows
one
to
shut
one
desk
and
amble
comfortably
home
for
dinner
at
least
five
days
in
the
week
everybody
is
at
least
plump
in
this
comfortable
gemutlich
town
where
everybody
placidly
locks
his
shop
or
office
and
goes
home
at
noon
to
dine
heavily
on
soup
and
meat
and
vegetables
and
pudding
washed
down
by
the
inevitable
beer
and
followed
by
forty
winks
on
the
dining
room
sofa
with
the
german
zeitung
spread
comfortably
over
the
head
as
protection
against
the
flies
there
is
a
fascination
about
the
bright
little
city
there
is
about
it
something
quaint
and
foreign
as
though
a
of
the
old
world
had
been
dumped
bodily
into
the
lap
of
wisconsin
it
does
not
seem
at
all
strange
to
hear
german
spoken
everywhere
in
the
streets
in
the
shops
in
the
theaters
in
the
street
cars
one
day
i
chanced
upon
a
sign
hung
above
the
doorway
of
a
little
german
bakery
over
on
the
north
side
there
were
hornchen
and
kaffeekuchen
in
the
windows
and
a
brood
of
and
sticky
children
in
the
back
of
the
shop
i
stopped
to
stare
at
the
worn
sign
tacked
over
the
door
hier
wird
englisch
gesprochen
it
announced
i
blinked
then
i
read
it
again
i
shut
my
eyes
and
opened
them
again
suddenly
the
fat
german
letters
spoke
their
message
as
before
english
spoken
on
reaching
the
office
i
told
norberg
the
city
editor
about
my
find
he
was
not
impressed
norberg
never
is
impressed
he
is
the
most
and
theatrical
city
editor
that
i
have
ever
met
he
is
fat
and
unbelievably
nimble
and
and
untiring
he
says
hell
when
things
go
wrong
he
smokes
innumerable
cigarettes
inhaling
the
fumes
and
sending
out
the
thin
wraith
of
smoke
with
little
explosive
sounds
between
tongue
and
lips
he
wears
blue
shirts
and
no
collar
to
speak
of
and
his
trousers
are
kept
in
place
only
by
a
miracle
and
an
inefficient
looking
leather
belt
when
he
refused
to
see
the
story
in
the
little
german
bakery
sign
i
began
to
argue
but
man
alive
this
is
america
i
think
i
know
a
story
when
i
see
it
suppose
you
were
traveling
in
germany
and
should
come
across
a
sign
over
a
shop
saying
wird
deutsch
gesprochen
would
you
think
you
were
dreaming
norberg
waved
an
explanatory
hand
this
is
america
this
is
milwaukee
after
you
lived
here
a
year
or
so
you
understand
what
i
mean
if
we
should
run
a
story
of
that
sign
with
a
cut
milwaukee
would
even
see
the
but
it
was
not
necessary
that
i
live
in
milwaukee
a
year
or
so
in
order
to
understand
its
peculiarities
for
i
had
a
personal
conductor
and
efficient
guide
in
the
new
friend
that
had
come
into
my
life
with
the
first
day
of
my
work
on
the
post
surely
no
woman
ever
had
a
stronger
friend
than
little
blackie
griffith
sporting
editor
of
the
milwaukee
post
we
became
friends
not
step
by
step
but
in
one
gigantic
leap
such
as
sometimes
triumphs
over
the
gap
between
acquaintance
and
liking
i
never
shall
forget
my
first
glimpse
of
him
he
strolled
into
the
city
room
from
his
little
domicile
across
the
hall
a
shabby
disreputable
office
coat
was
worn
over
his
street
clothes
and
he
was
puffing
at
a
freakish
little
pipe
in
the
shape
of
a
miniature
automobile
he
eyed
me
a
moment
from
the
doorway
a
fantastic
elfin
little
figure
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
so
strange
and
so
ugly
a
face
as
that
of
this
little
brown
welshman
with
his
lank
black
hair
and
his
uncanny
black
eyes
suddenly
he
trotted
over
to
me
with
a
quick
little
step
in
the
doorway
he
had
looked
forty
now
a
smile
illumined
the
many
lines
of
his
dark
countenance
and
in
some
miraculous
way
he
looked
twenty
are
you
the
new
york
importation
he
asked
his
great
black
eyes
searching
my
face
i
what
left
of
it
i
replied
meekly
i
understand
you
been
in
for
repairs
must
of
met
up
with
on
the
road
they
say
the
goin
is
full
of
bumps
in
n
bumps
i
laughed
it
uphill
every
bit
of
the
road
and
yet
got
to
go
full
speed
to
get
anywhere
but
i
running
easily
again
thank
he
waved
away
a
cloud
of
and
knowingly
squinted
through
the
haze
we
do
speed
up
much
here
and
they
ai
no
hill
climbin
speak
of
but
say
if
you
ever
should
hit
a
nasty
place
on
the
route
toot
your
siren
for
me
and
i
come
i
a
regular
little
human
garage
when
it
comes
to
patchin
up
those
aggravatin
screws
that
need
oilin
and
say
do
let
norberg
bully
you
my
name
blackie
i
goin
like
you
come
on
over
t
my
sanctum
once
in
a
while
and
i
show
you
my
scrapbook
and
let
you
play
with
the
office
and
so
it
happened
that
i
had
not
been
in
milwaukee
a
month
before
blackie
and
i
were
friends
norah
was
horrified
my
letters
were
full
of
him
i
told
her
that
she
might
get
a
more
complete
mental
picture
of
him
if
she
knew
that
he
wore
the
pinkest
shirts
and
the
purplest
neckties
and
the
blackest
and
whitest
of
checked
vests
that
ever
aroused
the
envy
of
an
office
boy
and
beneath
them
all
the
gentlest
of
hearts
and
therefore
one
loves
him
there
is
a
sort
of
spell
about
the
illiterate
little
slangy
brown
welshman
he
is
the
presiding
genius
of
the
place
the
office
boys
adore
him
the
old
man
takes
his
advice
in
selecting
a
new
motor
car
the
managing
editor
arranges
his
lunch
hour
to
suit
blackie
and
they
go
off
to
the
press
club
together
arm
in
arm
it
is
blackie
who
lends
a
sympathetic
ear
to
the
society
editor
tale
of
woe
he
hires
and
fires
the
office
boys
boldly
he
criticizes
the
news
editor
makeup
he
receives
delegations
of
persons
he
gently
explains
to
the
photographer
why
that
last
batch
of
cuts
make
their
subjects
look
as
if
afflicted
with
the
german
measles
he
arbitrates
any
row
that
the
newspaper
may
have
with
such
dignitaries
as
the
mayor
or
the
chief
of
police
he
manages
boxing
shows
he
skims
about
in
a
smart
little
roadster
he
edits
the
best
sporting
page
in
the
city
and
at
four
of
an
afternoon
he
likes
to
send
around
the
corner
for
a
chunk
of
devil
food
cake
with
butter
filling
from
the
woman
exchange
blackie
never
went
to
school
to
speak
of
he
does
know
was
from
were
but
he
can
see
a
story
quicker
and
farther
and
clearer
than
any
newspaper
man
i
ever
knew
excepting
peter
orme
there
is
a
legend
about
to
the
effect
that
one
day
the
managing
editor
who
is
scotch
and
without
a
sense
of
humor
ordered
that
blackie
should
henceforth
be
addressed
by
his
surname
of
griffith
as
being
a
more
dignified
appellation
for
the
use
of
fellow
reporters
copy
kids
office
boys
and
others
about
the
big
building
the
day
after
the
order
was
issued
the
managing
editor
summoned
a
freckled
youth
and
thrust
a
sheaf
of
galley
proofs
into
his
hand
take
those
to
griffith
he
ordered
without
looking
up
t
who
to
griffith
said
the
managing
editor
laboriously
and
scowling
a
bit
the
boy
took
three
unwilling
steps
toward
the
door
then
he
turned
a
puzzled
face
toward
the
managing
editor
say
honest
i
ai
never
heard
of
dat
guy
he
must
be
a
new
one
i
find
him
oh
damn
take
those
proofs
to
blackie
roared
the
managing
editor
and
thus
ended
blackie
enforced
flight
into
the
realms
of
dignity
all
these
things
and
more
i
wrote
to
the
scandalized
norah
i
informed
her
that
he
wore
more
diamond
rings
and
scarf
pins
and
watch
fobs
than
a
railroad
conductor
and
that
his
checked
shrieked
to
heaven
there
came
back
a
letter
in
which
every
third
word
was
underlined
and
which
ended
by
asking
what
the
morals
of
such
a
man
could
be
then
i
tried
to
make
blackie
more
real
to
norah
who
in
all
her
sheltered
life
had
never
come
in
contact
with
a
man
like
this
as
for
his
morals
or
what
you
would
consider
his
morals
sis
they
probably
are
a
deep
crimson
but
i
swear
there
is
no
yellow
streak
i
never
have
heard
anything
more
pathetic
than
his
story
blackie
sold
papers
on
a
corner
when
he
was
a
baby
six
years
old
then
he
got
a
job
as
office
boy
here
and
he
used
to
sharpen
pencils
and
run
errands
and
carry
copy
after
office
hours
he
took
care
of
some
horses
in
an
alley
barn
near
by
and
after
that
work
was
done
he
was
employed
about
the
pressroom
of
one
of
the
old
german
newspaper
offices
sometimes
he
would
be
too
weary
to
crawl
home
after
working
half
the
night
and
so
he
would
fall
asleep
a
worn
tragic
little
figure
on
a
pile
of
old
papers
and
sacks
in
a
warm
corner
near
the
presses
he
was
the
head
of
a
household
and
every
penny
counted
and
all
the
time
he
was
watching
things
and
learning
nothing
escaped
those
keen
black
eyes
he
used
to
help
the
photographer
when
there
was
a
pile
of
plates
to
develop
and
presently
he
knew
more
about
photography
than
the
man
himself
so
they
made
him
staff
photographer
in
some
marvelous
way
he
knew
more
ball
players
and
fighters
and
horsemen
than
the
sporting
editor
he
had
a
nose
for
news
that
was
nothing
short
of
wonderful
he
never
went
out
of
the
office
without
coming
back
with
a
story
they
used
to
use
him
in
the
sporting
department
when
a
rush
was
on
then
he
became
one
of
the
sporting
staff
then
assistant
sporting
editor
then
sporting
editor
he
knows
this
paper
from
the
basement
up
he
could
operate
a
linotype
or
act
as
managing
editor
with
equal
ease
no
i
afraid
that
blackie
has
had
much
time
for
morals
but
norah
dear
i
wish
that
you
could
hear
him
when
he
talks
about
his
mother
he
may
follow
doubtful
paths
and
associate
with
questionable
people
and
wear
restless
clothes
but
i
would
exchange
his
friendship
for
that
of
a
dozen
of
your
ordinary
good
men
all
these
years
of
work
and
suffering
have
made
an
old
man
of
little
blackie
although
he
is
young
in
years
but
they
have
spoiled
his
heart
any
he
is
able
to
distinguish
between
sham
and
truth
because
he
has
been
obliged
to
do
it
ever
since
he
was
a
child
selling
papers
on
the
corner
but
he
still
clings
to
the
office
that
gave
him
his
start
although
he
makes
more
money
in
a
single
week
outside
the
office
than
his
salary
would
amount
to
in
half
a
year
he
says
that
this
is
a
job
that
does
not
interfere
with
his
such
is
blackie
surely
the
oddest
friend
a
woman
ever
had
he
possesses
a
genius
for
friendship
and
a
wonderful
understanding
of
suffering
born
of
those
years
of
hardship
and
privation
each
learned
the
story
bit
by
bit
in
a
series
of
confidences
exchanged
during
that
peaceful
beatific
period
that
follows
just
after
the
last
edition
has
gone
down
blackie
little
of
an
office
is
always
blue
with
smoke
and
cluttered
with
a
thousand
odds
and
ends
photographs
souvenirs
a
litter
of
pipes
and
tobacco
a
wardrobe
of
discarded
coats
and
hats
and
blackie
in
the
midst
of
it
all
sunk
in
the
depths
of
his
swivel
chair
and
looking
like
an
amiable
brown
gnome
or
a
cheerful
little
god
come
to
life
there
is
in
him
an
uncanny
wisdom
which
only
the
streets
can
teach
he
is
one
of
those
born
newspaper
men
who
could
not
live
out
of
sight
of
the
and
the
and
the
y
see
girl
it
like
this
here
blackie
explained
one
day
all
workin
for
some
good
reason
a
few
of
us
are
workin
for
the
glory
of
it
and
most
of
us
are
workin
t
eat
and
lots
of
us
are
an
savin
in
the
hopes
that
some
day
we
have
money
enough
to
get
back
at
some
people
we
know
but
there
is
some
few
workin
for
the
pure
love
of
the
work
and
i
guess
i
one
of
them
fools
y
see
i
started
in
at
this
game
when
i
was
such
a
little
runt
that
now
it
a
ingrowing
habit
though
it
is
comfortin
t
know
you
got
a
place
where
you
always
come
in
out
of
the
rain
and
where
you
have
your
mail
this
newspaper
work
is
a
curse
i
remarked
show
me
a
clever
newspaper
man
and
i
show
you
a
failure
there
is
nothing
in
it
but
the
glory
and
little
of
that
we
contrive
and
scheme
and
run
about
all
day
getting
a
story
and
then
we
write
it
at
fever
heat
searching
our
souls
for
words
that
are
cleancut
and
virile
and
then
we
turn
it
in
and
what
is
it
what
have
we
to
show
for
our
day
work
an
ephemeral
thing
lacking
the
first
breath
of
life
a
thing
that
is
dead
before
it
is
born
why
any
cub
reporter
if
he
were
to
put
into
some
other
profession
the
same
amount
of
nerve
and
tact
and
ingenuity
and
finesse
and
that
he
expends
in
prying
a
single
story
out
of
some
unwilling
victim
could
retire
with
a
fortune
in
no
blackie
blew
down
the
stem
of
his
pipe
preparatory
to
the
bowl
there
was
a
quizzical
light
in
his
black
eyes
the
little
heap
of
burned
matches
at
his
elbow
was
growing
to
kindling
wood
proportions
it
was
common
knowledge
that
blackie
trick
of
lighting
pipe
or
cigarette
and
then
forgetting
to
puff
at
it
caused
his
bill
for
matches
to
exceed
his
tobacco
expense
account
you
talk
chuckled
blackie
like
you
meant
it
but
girl
it
a
lonesome
game
this
retirin
with
a
fortune
i
noticed
that
them
guys
who
retire
with
a
barrel
of
money
usually
dies
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
a
kind
of
a
lingerin
homesickness
you
see
their
pictures
in
th
papers
with
a
pathetic
story
of
how
they
was
just
beginnin
t
enjoy
life
when
along
comes
the
grim
reaper
an
claims
blackie
slid
down
in
his
chair
and
blew
a
column
of
smoke
ceilingward
i
knew
a
guy
once
newspaper
man
too
who
retired
with
a
fortune
he
used
to
do
the
city
hall
for
us
well
he
got
in
soft
with
the
new
administration
before
election
and
made
quite
a
pile
in
stocks
that
was
tipped
off
to
him
by
his
political
friends
his
wife
was
crazy
for
him
to
quit
the
newspaper
game
he
done
it
an
say
that
guy
kept
on
gettin
richer
and
richer
till
even
his
wife
was
almost
satisfied
but
girl
was
that
chap
lonesome
one
day
he
come
up
here
looking
like
a
dog
that
run
off
with
the
steak
he
was
just
dyin
for
a
kind
word
an
he
sniffed
the
smell
of
the
ink
and
the
hot
metal
like
it
was
june
roses
he
kind
of
wanders
over
to
his
old
desk
and
slumps
down
in
the
chair
and
tips
it
back
and
puts
his
feet
on
the
desk
with
his
hat
tipped
back
and
a
bum
stogie
in
his
mouth
and
along
came
a
kid
with
a
bunch
of
papers
wet
from
the
presses
and
sticks
one
in
his
hand
and
well
girl
that
fellow
he
just
wriggled
he
was
so
happy
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
every
man
on
a
morning
paper
spends
his
day
off
hanging
around
the
office
wishin
that
a
mob
or
a
fire
or
somethin
big
would
tear
lose
so
he
could
get
back
into
the
game
i
guess
i
told
you
about
the
time
von
gerhard
sent
me
abroad

i
von
gerhard
i
repeated
startled

of
went
to
pieces
about
that
time
and
i
went
t
him
to
be
patched
up
he
thumps
me
fore
aft
firing
a
volley
of
questions
lookin
up
the
roof
of
m
mouth
and
at
m
finger
nails
an
teeth
like
i
was
a
prize
horse
for
sale
then
he
sits
still
lookin
at
me
for
about
half
a
minute
till
i
begin
t
feel
uncomfortable
then
he
says
slow
man

old

i
says

to
his
promise

from
the
doorway
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day

rush
of
the
day

so
glad

must
have
passed
it
a
dozen
times
without
once
noticing
it
just
a
dingy
little
black
shop
nestling
between
two
taller
buildings
almost
within
the
shadow
of
the
city
hall
over
the
sidewalk
swung
a
shabby
black
sign
with
gilt
letters
that
spelled
franz
blackie
waved
an
introductory
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
sign
there
he
is
that
all
you
ever
see
of
dead
asked
i
regretfully
as
we
entered
the
narrow
doorway
no
down
in
the
basement
baking
two
tiny
faced
the
street
such
queer
windows
in
these
days
of
plate
glass
at
the
back
they
were
quite
open
to
the
shop
and
in
one
of
them
reposed
a
huge
white
immovable
structure
a
majestic
heavy
nutty
surely
indigestible
birthday
cake
around
its
edge
were
flutings
and
scrolls
of
white
icing
and
on
its
broad
breast
reposed
cherries
and
stout
butterflies
of
jelly
and
cunning
traceries
of
colored
sugar
it
was
quite
the
dressiest
cake
i
had
ever
beheld
surely
no
human
hand
could
be
wanton
enough
to
guide
a
knife
through
all
that
magnificence
but
in
the
center
of
all
this
splendor
was
an
inscription
in
heavy
white
letters
of
icing
charlottens
reluctantly
i
tore
my
gaze
from
this
imposing
example
of
the
german
confectioner
art
for
blackie
was
tugging
impatiently
at
my
sleeve
but
blackie
i
marveled
do
you
honestly
suppose
that
that
structure
is
intended
for
some
charlotte
birthday
in
milwaukee
explained
blackie
you
got
a
birthday
you
got
have
a
geburtstag
cake
with
your
name
on
it
and
all
the
cousins
and
aunts
and
members
of
the
north
side
frauen
turner
verein
gesellchaft
in
for
the
day
it
ai
considered
decent
if
you
do
are
you
ready
to
fight
your
way
into
the
main
tent
it
was
holiday
time
and
the
single
narrow
aisle
of
the
front
shop
was
crowded
it
was
not
easy
to
elbow
one
way
through
the
packed
little
space
men
and
women
were
ordering
recklessly
of
the
cakes
of
every
description
that
were
heaped
in
cases
and
on
shelves
cakes
what
a
pale
dry
name
to
apply
to
those
crumbling
melting
indigestible
german
confections
blackie
grinned
with
enjoyment
while
i
gazed
there
were
cakes
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
and
of
which
i
did
not
even
know
the
names
there
were
little
round
cup
cakes
made
of
almond
paste
that
melts
in
the
mouth
there
were
schnecken
glazed
with
a
delicious
candied
brown
sugar
there
were
bismarcks
composed
of
layer
upon
layer
of
flaky
crust
inlaid
with
an
oozy
custard
that
evades
the
eager
consumer
at
the
first
bite
and
that
slides
down
one
collar
when
chased
with
a
pursuing
tongue
there
were
pfeffernusse
there
were
lebkuchen
there
were
apfelkuchen
the
juicy
fruit
stuck
thickly
into
the
crust
the
whole
dusted
over
with
powdered
sugar
there
were
torten
and
hornchen
and
butter
cookies
blackie
touched
my
arm
and
i
tore
my
gaze
from
a
schaumtorte
that
was
being
reverently
packed
for
delivery
my
what
a
greedy
girl
now
get
your
mind
all
made
up

is
your
chance

mind
i
hate
t
have
you
blunder
have
you
decided
decided
how
can
i
i
moaned
watching
a
alsatian
girl
behind
the
counter
as
she
rolled
a
piece
of
white
paper
into
a
cone
and
dipped
a
spoonful
of
whipped
cream
from
a
great
brown
bowl
heaped
high
with
the
snowy
stuff
she
filled
the
paper
cone
inserted
the
point
of
it
into
one
end
of
a
hollow
pastry
horn
and
gently
squeezed
presto
a
hornchen
oh
blackie
i
gasped
come
on
i
want
to
go
in
and
as
we
elbowed
our
way
to
the
rear
room
separated
from
the
front
shop
only
by
a
flimsy
wooden
partition
i
expected
i
know
not
what
but
surely
this
was
not
blackie
baumbach
this
long
narrow
dingy
room
with
its
bare
floor
and
its
tables
whose
bare
marble
tops
were
yellow
with
age
and
use
i
said
nothing
as
we
seated
ourselves
blackie
was
watching
me
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
my
glance
wandered
about
the
shabby
room
and
slowly
and
surely
the
charm
of
that
fusty
dingy
little
cafe
came
upon
me
a
huge
stove
glowed
red
in
one
corner
on
the
wall
behind
the
stove
was
suspended
a
wooden
rack
black
with
age
its
compartments
holding
german
austrian
and
hungarian
newspapers
against
the
opposite
wall
stood
an
ancient
walnut
mirror
and
above
it
hung
a
colored
print
of
bismarck
helmeted
uniformed
and
fiercely
mustached
the
clumsy
tables
stood
in
two
solemn
rows
down
the
length
of
the
narrow
room
three
or
four
stout
blond
girls
plodded
back
and
forth
from
tables
to
front
shop
bearing
trays
of
cakes
and
steaming
cups
of
coffee
there
was
a
rumble
and
clatter
of
german
every
one
seemed
to
know
every
one
else
a
game
of
chess
was
in
progress
at
one
table
and
between
moves
each
contestant
would
refresh
himself
with
a
sibilant
mouthful
of
coffee
there
was
nothing
about
the
place
or
its
occupants
to
remind
one
of
america
this
dim
smoky
cafe
was
germany
time
said
blackie
here
comes
rosie
to
take
our
order
you
can
take
your
choice
of
coffee
or
chocolate
that
as
fancy
as
they
get
an
expansive
blond
girl
paused
at
our
table
smiling
a
broad
welcome
at
blackie
wie
geht
roschen
he
greeted
her
roschen
smile
became
still
more
pervasive
so
that
her
blue
eyes
disappeared
in
creases
of
good
humor
she
wiped
the
marble
table
top
with
a
large
and
careless
gesture
that
precipitated
stray
crumbs
into
our
laps
gut
murmured
she
coyly
and
leaned
one
hand
on
a
portly
hip
in
an
attitude
of
waiting
coffee
asked
blackie
turning
to
me
i
nodded
zweimal
kaffee

roschen
grasping
the
idea
now
your
time
to
speak
up
urged
blackie
go
ahead
an
order

the
cream
gefillte
things
that
looked
good
to
you
out
in
but
i
leaned
forward
lowering
my
voice
discreetly
blackie
before
i
plunge
in
too
recklessly
tell
me
are
their
prices
very
child

just
ca

a
dollar

yuh
your
check
an
say

so
wade
right
in
an
spoil
your
with
enthusiasm
i
turned
upon
the
patient
rosie
o
bring
me
some
of
those
cunning
little
round
things
with
the
cream
on
you
know
two
of
those
eh
blackie
and
a
couple
of
those
with
the
flaky
crust
and
the
custard
between
and
a
slice
of
that
cake
and
some
of
those
funny
shaped
cookies
but
a
pall
of
bewilderment
was
slowly
settling
over
rosie
erstwhile
smiling
face
her
plump
shoulders
went
up
in
a
helpless
shrug
and
she
turned
her
round
blue
eyes
appealingly
to
blackie
was
meint
sie
alles
she
asked
so
i
began
all
over
again
with
the
assistance
of
blackie
we
went
into
minute
detail
we
made
elaborate
gestures
we
drew
pictures
of
our
desired
goodies
on
the
table
using
a
pencil
rosie
countenance
wore
a
distracted
look
in
desperation
i
was
about
to
accompany
her
to
the
crowded
shop
there
to
point
out
my
chosen
dainties
when
suddenly
as
they
would
put
it
here
a
light
went
her
over
ach
sie
wollten
vielleicht
abgeruhrter
gugelhopf
haben
und
auch
schaumtorte
und
bismarcks
und
hornchen
mit
cream
gefullt
nicht
certainly
i
murmured
quite
crushed
roschen
waddled
merrily
off
to
the
shop
blackie
was
rolling
a
cigarette
he
ran
his
funny
little
red
tongue
along
the
edge
of
the
paper
and
glanced
up
at
me
in
glee
bother
about
me
he
generously
observed
just
set
still
and
let
the
atmosphere
soak
but
already
i
was
lost
in
contemplation
of
a
pompadoured
german
who
was
drinking
coffee
and
reading
the
fliegende
blatter
at
a
table
just
across
the
way
there
were
counterparts
of
my
aborigines
at
knapf
thick
spectacled
engineers
with
high
foreheads
actors
and
actresses
from
the
german
stock
company
reporters
from
the
english
and
german
newspapers
business
men
with
comfortable
german
consciences
musicians
dapper
young
lawyers
a
giggling
group
of
college
girls
and
boys
a
couple
of
smartly
dressed
women
nibbling
appreciatively
at
slices
of
nusstorte
lovers
whose
coffee
cups
stood
untouched
at
their
elbows
while
no
fragrant
cloud
of
steam
rose
to
indicate
that
there
was
warmth
within
their
glances
grow
warmer
as
the
neglected
kaffee
grows
colder
the
color
comes
and
goes
in
the
girl
face
and
i
watch
it
a
bit
enviously
marveling
that
the
old
story
still
should
be
so
new
at
a
large
square
table
near
the
doorway
a
group
of
eight
men
were
absorbed
in
an
animated
political
discussion
accompanied
by
much
waving
of
arms
and
thundering
of
gutturals
it
appeared
to
be
a
table
of
importance
for
the
bench
that
ran
along
one
side
was
upholstered
in
worn
red
velvet
and
every
newcomer
paused
a
moment
to
nod
or
to
say
a
word
in
greeting
it
was
not
of
american
politics
that
they
talked
but
of
the
politics
of
austria
and
hungary
finally
the
argument
resolved
itself
into
a
duel
of
words
between
a
handsome
german
whose
rosy
skin
seemed
to
take
on
a
deeper
tone
in
contrast
to
the
whiteness
of
his
hair
and
mustache
and
a
swarthy
young
fellow
whose
thick
spectacles
and
heavy
mane
of
black
hair
gave
him
the
look
of
a
caricature
out
of
an
illustrated
german
weekly
the
man
argued
loudly
with
much
rapping
of
bare
knuckles
on
the
table
top
but
the
dark
man
spoke
seldom
and
softly
with
a
little
twisted
on
his
lips
and
whenever
he
spoke
the
man
grew
redder
and
there
came
a
huge
laugh
from
the
others
who
sat
listening
say
would
it
curdle
your
english
blackie
laughed
solemnly
i
turned
to
him
blackie
griffith
these
people
do
not
even
realize
that
there
is
anything
unusual
about
sure
not
that
the
beauty
of
it
they
do
need
to
make
no
artificial
atmosphere
for
this
place
it
just
grows
wild
like
dandelions
everybody
comes
here
for
their
coffee
because
their
aunts
an
uncles
and
grossmutters
and
grosspapas
used
t
come
and
come
yet
if
they
livin
an
after
all
what
is
it
but
a
little
german
bakery
but
o
wise
herr
baumbach
down
in
the
kitchen
o
subtle
frau
baumbach
back
of
the
desk
said
i
others
may
fit
their
shops
with
mirrors
and
chandeliers
and
oriental
rugs
and
mahogany
but
you
sit
serenely
by
and
you
smile
and
you
change
nothing
you
let
the
brown
walls
grow
dimmer
with
age
you
see
the
tables
turning
yellow
you
leave
bare
your
wooden
floor
and
you
smile
and
smile
and
fine
applauded
blackie
you
on
and
here
comes
rosie
the
radiant
placed
on
the
table
cups
and
saucers
of
an
unbelievable
thickness
she
set
them
down
on
the
marble
surface
with
a
crash
as
one
who
knows
well
that
no
mere
marble
or
granite
could
shatter
the
solidity
of
those
stout
earthenware
receptacles
napkins
there
were
none
i
was
to
learn
that
fingers
were
rid
of
any
clinging
remnants
of
cream
or
crumb
by
the
simple
expedient
of
licking
them
blackie
emptied
his
pitcher
of
cream
into
his
cup
of
black
black
coffee
sugared
it
stirred
tasted
and
then
with
a
wicked
gleam
in
his
black
eyes
he
lifted
the
heavy
cup
to
his
lips
and
took
a
long
gurgling
mouthful
blackie
i
hissed
if
you
do
that
again
i
shall
refuse
to
speak
to
you
do
what
demanded
he
all
injured
innocence
snuffle
up
your
coffee
like
why
girl
that
th
proper
way
t
drink
coffee
here
listen
everybody
and
while
i
glared
he
wrapped
his
hand
lovingly
about
his
cup
holding
the
spoon
imprisoned
between
first
and
second
fingers
and
took
another
sibilant
mouthful
any
more
of
your
back
talk
and
drink
it
out
of
m
saucer
an
blow
on
it
like
the
hefty
party
over
there
in
the
earrings
is
doin
calm
yerself
an
try
a
i
picked
up
one
of
the
flaky
confections
and
eyed
it
in
despair
there
were
no
plates
except
that
on
which
the
cakes
reposed
how
does
one
eat
them
i
inquired
yuh
do
really
eat
the
motion
is
more
like
inhalin
t
eat
successful
you
really
ought
t
get
into
a
with
water
because
as
soon
you
bite
in
at
one
end
the
custard
stuff
slides
out
at
the
other
an
no
human
mouth
be
two
places
at
oncet
shut
your
eyes
girl
an
just
wade
i
waded
in
silence
i
took
a
deep
delicious
bite
nimbly
chased
the
coy
filling
around
a
corner
with
my
tongue
devoured
every
bit
down
to
the
last
crumb
and
licked
the
stickiness
off
my
fingers
then
i
investigated
the
interior
of
the
next
cake
i
coming
here
every
day
i
announced
better
not
ruin
your
complexion
and
turn
all
your
lines
into
bumps

at
the
dame

the
earrings

nusshornchen
and
a
slice
of

she
a
horrible
example
and
yet
she
got
th
nerve
t
wear
a
princess
gown

i
replied
recklessly
my
voice
choked
with
whipped
cream
and
butteriness
i
can
just
feel
myself
getting
greasy
have
i
done
beautifully
for
a
new
hand
now
tell
me
about
some
of
these
people
who
is
the
funny
little
man
in
the
checked
suit
with
the
black
braid
trimming
and
the
green
cravat
and
the
white
spats
and
the
tan
hat
and
the
eyeglasses
ai
them
th
dizzy
habiliments
a
note
of
envy
crept
into
voice
his
name
is
hugo
luders
used
t
be
a
reporter
on
the
germania
but
he
reformed
and
gone
into
advertisin
where
there
real
money
some
say
he
wears
them
on
a
bet
and
some
say
his
taste
in
dress
is
a
curse
descended
upon
him
from
joseph
the
guy
with
the
fancy
coat
but
i
think
he
wears
because
he
fancies
he
been
coming
here
ever
afternoon
for
twelve
years
has
a
cup
of
coffee
game
of
chess
and
a
with
a
bunch
of
cronies
if
baumbach
ever
decide
to
paint
the
front
of
their
shop
or
put
in
cut
glass
fixtures
and
handpainted
china
hugo
luders
would
serve
an
injunction
on
next
who
the
woman
with
the
leathery
complexion
and
the
belt
to
match
and
the
untidy
hair
and
the
big
feet
i
like
her
face
and
why
does
she
sit
at
a
table
with
all
those
men
and
who
are
all
the
men
and
who
is
the
grand
opera
tenor
just
coming
in
oh
blackie
glanced
over
his
shoulder
just
as
the
tall
man
in
the
doorway
turned
his
face
toward
us
that
why
girl
that
von
gerhard
the
man
who
gives
me
one
more
year
t
live
look
at
everybody
kowtowing
to
him
he
do
favor
baumbach
often
too
busy
patching
up
the
nervous
wrecks
that
are
washed
up
on
his
the
tall
figure
in
the
doorway
was
glancing
from
table
to
table
nodding
here
and
there
to
an
acquaintance
his
eyes
traveled
the
length
of
the
room
now
they
were
nearing
us
i
felt
a
sudden
inexplicable
tightening
at
heart
and
throat
as
though
fingers
were
clutching
there
then
his
eyes
met
mine
and
i
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
my
face
as
he
came
swiftly
over
to
our
table
and
took
my
hand
in
his
so
you
have
discovered
baumbach
he
said
may
i
have
my
coffee
and
cigar
here
with
you
blackie
here
is
responsible
for
my
being
initiated
into
the
sticky
mysteries
of
baumbach
i
never
should
have
discovered
it
if
he
had
not
offered
to
act
as
personal
conductor
you
know
one
another
i
believe
the
two
men
shook
hands
across
the
table
there
was
something
forced
and
graceless
about
the
act
blackie
eyed
von
gerhard
through
a
misty
curtain
of
cigarette
smoke
von
gerhard
gazed
at
blackie
through
narrowed
lids
as
he
lighted
his
cigar
i
th
gink
you
killed
off
two
or
three
years
back
blackie
explained
i
remember
you
perfectly
von
gerhard
returned
courteously
i
rejoice
to
see
that
i
was
well
drawled
blackie
a
wicked
gleam
in
his
black
eyes
some
rejoiced
old
top
angel
wings
and
a
white
kimono
worn
would
go
some
rotten
with
my
spanish
style
of
beauty
what
did
know
that
you
and
friend
here
was
acquainted
known
each
other
long
i
felt
myself
flushing
again
i
knew
von
gerhard
back
home
i
scarcely
seen
him
since
i
have
been
here
famous
specialists
ca
be
bothered
with
relatives
of
their
college
friends
can
they
herr
doktor
and
now
it
was
von
gerhard
face
that
flushed
a
deep
and
painful
crimson
he
looked
at
me
in
silence
and
i
felt
very
little
and
insignificant
and
much
like
an
impudent
child
who
has
stuck
out
its
tongue
at
its
elders
silent
men
always
affect
talkative
women
in
that
way
you
know
that
what
you
say
is
not
true
he
said
slowly
well
we
wo
quibble
we
we
were
just
about
to
leave
were
we
blackie
just
said
blackie
rising
sorry
t
see
you
drinkin
coffee
doc
it
ai
fair
t
your
quite
right
replied
von
gerhard
and
rose
with
us
i
shall
not
drink
it
i
shall
walk
home
with
orme
instead
if
she
will
allow
me
that
will
be
more
stimulating
than
coffee
and
twice
as
dangerous
perhaps
but
you
know
how
i
hate
that
sort
of
thing
i
said
coldly
as
we
passed
from
the
warmth
of
the
little
front
shop
where
the
plump
girls
were
still
filling
pasteboard
boxes
with
holiday
cakes
to
the
brisk
chill
of
the
winter
street
the
little
sign
swung
and
creaked
in
the
wind
whimsically
and
with
the
memory
of
that
last
cake
fresh
in
my
mind
i
saluted
the
letters
that
spelled
franz
blackie
chuckled
impishly
just
the
same
try
a
pinch
of
soda
when
you
get
home
dawn
he
advised
well
i
off
to
the
factory
again
got
t
make
up
for
time
wasted
on
m
lady
friend
auf
wiedersehen
and
the
little
figure
in
the
checked
trotted
off
but
he
called
you
dawn
broke
from
von
gerhard
mhum
i
agreed
my
name
surely
not
to
him
you
have
known
him
but
a
few
weeks
i
would
not
have
presumed
blackie
never
presumes
i
laughed
blackie
just
blackie
imagine
taking
offense
at
him
he
knows
every
one
by
their
given
name
from
jo
the
boss
of
the
pressroom
to
the
chief
who
imports
his
office
coats
from
london
besides
blackie
and
i
are
newspaper
men
and
people
scrape
and
bow
in
a
newspaper
office
especially
when
they
fond
of
one
another
you
would
as
i
looked
at
von
gerhard
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
i
saw
a
tense
drawn
look
about
the
little
group
of
muscles
which
show
when
the
teeth
are
set
hard
when
he
spoke
those
muscles
had
relaxed
but
little
one
man
does
not
talk
ill
of
another
but
this
is
different
i
want
to
ask
you
do
you
know
what
manner
of
man
this
this
blackie
is
i
ask
you
because
i
would
have
you
safe
and
sheltered
always
from
such
as
he
because
i
safe
from
blackie
now
listen
there
never
was
a
safer
saner
truer
more
generous
friend
oh
i
know
what
his
life
has
been
but
what
else
could
it
have
been
beginning
as
he
did
i
have
no
wish
to
reform
him
i
tried
my
hand
at
reforming
one
man
and
made
a
glorious
mess
of
it
so
i
just
take
blackie
as
he
is
if
you
please
slang
wickedness
pink
shirt
red
necktie
diamond
rings
and
all
if
there
any
bad
in
him
we
all
know
it
for
it
right
down
on
the
table
face
up
you
just
angry
because
he
called
you
small
one
said
von
gerhard
in
his
quaint
german
idiom
we
will
not
quarrel
you
and
i
if
i
have
been
neglectful
it
was
because
edged
tools
were
never
a
chosen
plaything
of
mine
perhaps
your
little
blackie
realizes
that
he
need
have
no
fear
of
such
things
for
the
great
fear
is
upon
the
great
fear
you
mean
i
mean
that
there
are
too
many
fine
little
lines
radiating
from
the
corners
of
the
sunken
eyes
and
that
his
leaves
a
moisture
in
the
palm
ach
you
may
laugh
come
we
will
change
the
subject
to
something
more
cheerful
yes
tell
me
how
grows
the
book
by
inches
after
working
all
day
on
a
bulletin
paper
whose
city
editor
is
constantly
shouting
it
now
fellows
keep
it
down
crowded
it
is
too
much
of
a
wrench
to
find
myself
seated
calmly
before
my
own
typewriter
at
night
privileged
to
write
one
hundred
thousand
words
if
i
choose
i
ca
get
over
the
habit
of
crowding
the
story
all
into
the
first
paragraph
whenever
i
flower
into
a
descriptive
passage
i
glance
nervously
over
my
shoulder
expecting
to
find
norberg
stationed
behind
me
scissors
and
blue
pencil
in
hand
consequently
the
book
thus
far
sounds
very
much
like
a
police
reporter
story
of
a
fire
four
minutes
before
the
paper
is
due
to
go
to
von
gerhard
face
was
unsmiling
so
he
said
slowly
you
burn
the
candle
at
both
ends
all
day
you
write
is
it
not
so
and
at
night
you
come
home
to
write
still
more
ach
kindchen
na
we
shall
change
all
that
we
will
be
better
comrades
we
two
yes
you
remember
that
gay
little
walk
of
last
autumn
when
we
explored
the
michigan
country
lane
at
dusk
i
shall
be
your
sunday
schatz
and
there
shall
be
more
rambles
like
that
one
to
bring
the
roses
into
your
cheeks
we
shall
be
good
kameraden
as
you
and
this
little
griffith
are
what
is
it
they
say
good
fellows
that
is
it
good
fellows
yes
so
shall
we
shake
hands
on
it
but
i
snatched
my
hand
away
i
do
want
to
be
a
good
fellow
i
cried
i
tired
of
being
a
good
fellow
i
been
a
good
fellow
for
years
and
years
while
every
other
married
woman
in
the
world
has
been
happy
in
her
own
home
bringing
up
her
babies
when
i
am
old
i
want
some
sons
to
worry
me
too
and
to
stay
awake
nights
for
and
some
daughters
to
keep
me
young
and
to
prevent
me
from
doing
my
hair
in
a
knob
and
wearing
bonnets
i
hate
women
and
so
do
you
and
so
does
every
one
else
i
i
dawn
cried
von
gerhard
but
i
ran
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
behind
me
leaving
him
standing
there
chapter
ix
the
lady
from
vienna
two
more
aborigines
have
appeared
one
of
them
is
a
lady
aborigine
they
made
their
entrance
at
supper
and
i
forgot
to
eat
watching
them
the
are
from
vienna
he
is
an
expert
engineer
and
she
is
a
woman
of
noble
birth
with
a
history
their
combined
appearance
is
calculated
to
strike
terror
to
the
heart
he
is
daringly
ugly
with
a
chin
that
curves
in
under
his
lip
and
then
out
in
a
peak
like
pictures
of
punch
she
wore
a
gray
gown
of
a
style
i
never
had
seen
before
and
never
expect
to
see
again
it
was
fastened
with
huge
black
buttons
all
the
way
down
the
breathlessly
tight
front
and
the
upper
part
was
composed
of
that
garment
known
as
a
basque
she
curved
in
where
she
should
have
curved
out
and
she
bulged
where
she
should
have
had
about
her
neck
was
suspended
a
string
of
beads
that
clanked
as
she
walked
on
her
forehead
rested
a
sparse
fringe
mein
himmel
thought
i
am
i
dreaming
this
is
wisconsin
this
is
nurnberg
or
strassburg
with
a
dash
of
heidelberg
and
berlin
thrown
in
dawn
old
girl
it
going
to
be
more
instructive
than
a
cook
that
turned
out
to
be
the
truest
prophecy
i
ever
made
the
first
surprising
thing
that
the
did
was
to
seat
themselves
at
the
long
table
with
the
other
aborigines
the
lady
aborigine
being
the
only
woman
among
the
twelve
men
it
was
plain
that
they
had
known
one
another
previous
to
this
meeting
for
they
became
very
good
friends
at
once
and
the
men
grew
heavily
humorous
about
there
being
thirteen
at
table
at
that
the
lady
aborigine
began
to
laugh
straightway
i
forgot
the
outlandish
gown
forgot
the
beads
forgot
the
sparse
fringe
forgave
the
absence
of
such
a
voice
a
lilting
melodious
thing
she
broke
into
a
torrent
of
speech
with
bewildering
gestures
and
i
saw
that
her
hands
were
exquisitely
formed
and
as
expressive
as
her
voice
her
german
was
the
musical
tongue
of
the
viennese
possessing
none
of
the
gutturals
and
sputterings
when
she
crowned
it
with
the
gay
little
trilling
laugh
my
views
on
the
language
underwent
a
lightning
change
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
see
her
open
the
flat
silver
case
that
dangled
at
the
end
of
the
chain
take
out
a
cigarette
light
it
and
smoke
it
there
in
that
little
german
dining
room
she
wore
the
most
gracefully
nonchalant
air
imaginable
as
she
blew
little
rings
and
wreaths
and
laughed
and
chatted
brightly
with
her
husband
and
the
other
men
occasionally
she
broke
into
french
her
accent
as
charmingly
perfect
as
it
had
been
in
her
native
tongue
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
staring
on
the
part
of
the
respectable
frauen
at
the
other
tables
then
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
plunged
into
their
meal
again
there
was
a
certain
little
air
of
assurance
about
that
that
no
amount
of
staring
could
ruffle
watching
the
new
aborigines
grew
to
be
a
sort
of
game
the
lady
aborigine
of
the
golden
voice
and
the
ugly
husband
of
the
peaked
chin
had
a
strange
fascination
for
me
i
scrambled
downstairs
at
meal
time
in
order
not
to
miss
them
and
i
dawdled
over
the
meal
so
that
i
need
not
leave
before
they
i
discovered
that
when
the
lady
aborigine
was
animated
her
face
was
that
of
a
young
woman
possessing
a
certain
charm
but
that
when
in
repose
the
face
of
the
lady
aborigine
was
that
of
a
very
old
and
tired
woman
indeed
also
that
her
husband
bullied
her
and
that
when
he
did
that
she
looked
at
him
worshipingly
then
one
evening
a
week
or
so
after
the
appearance
of
the
new
aborigines
there
came
a
clumping
at
my
door
i
was
seated
at
my
typewriter
and
the
book
was
balkier
than
usual
and
i
wished
that
the
clumper
at
the
door
would
go
away
come
i
called
ungraciously
enough
then
on
second
thought
herein
the
knob
turned
slowly
and
the
door
opened
just
enough
to
admit
the
top
of
a
head
crowned
with
a
tight
moist
german
knob
of
hair
i
searched
my
memory
to
recognize
the
knob
failed
utterly
and
said
again
this
time
with
mingled
curiosity
and
hospitality
wo
you
come
in
the
apparently
bodiless
head
thrust
itself
forward
a
bit
disclosing
an
apologetically
smiling
face
with
high
check
bones
that
glistened
with
friendliness
and
scrubbing
nabben
fraulein
said
the
head
nabben
i
replied
more
mystified
than
ever
howdy
do
is
there
anything
the
head
thrust
itself
forward
still
more
showing
a
pair
of
plump
shoulders
as
its
support
then
the
plump
shoulders
heaved
into
the
room
disclosing
a
stout
starched
gingham
body
ich
bin
frau
knapf
announced
the
beaming
vision
now
up
to
this
time
frau
knapf
had
maintained
a
mysteriousness
i
had
heard
rumors
of
her
and
i
had
partaken
of
certain
crispy
dishes
of
german
extraction
reported
to
have
come
from
her
deft
hands
but
i
had
not
even
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
skirts
whisking
around
a
corner
therefore
frau
knapf
i
repeated
nonsense
there
ai
no
sich
person
that
is
i
glad
to
see
you
wo
you
come
in
and
sit
down
ach
no
smiled
the
substantial
frau
knapf
clinging
tightly
to
the
door
knob
i
got
no
time
it
gives
much
to
do
yet
kuchen
dough
i
must
set
und
ich
weiss
nicht
was
i
got
no
bustling
frau
knapf
this
was
why
i
had
never
had
a
glimpse
of
her
always
she
got
no
time
for
while
herr
knapf
dapper
and
genial
welcomed
chatted
with
the
diners
poured
a
glass
of
foaming
for
herr
weber
or
dexterously
carved
fowl
for
the
aborigines
table
frau
knapf
was
making
the
wheels
go
round
i
discovered
that
it
was
she
who
bakes
the
melting
golden
german
pfannkuchen
on
sunday
mornings
she
it
is
who
fries
the
crisp
and
hissing
wienerschnitzel
she
it
is
who
prepares
the
plump
ducklings
and
the
thick
gravies
and
the
steaming
lentil
soup
and
the
rosy
sausages
nestling
coyly
in
their
bed
of
sauerkraut
all
the
week
frau
knapf
bakes
and
broils
and
stews
her
rosy
cheeks
taking
on
a
twinkling
crimson
from
the
fire
over
which
she
bends
but
on
sunday
night
frau
knapf
sheds
her
huge
apron
and
rolls
down
the
sleeves
from
her
plump
arms
on
sunday
evening
she
leaves
pots
and
pans
and
cooking
and
is
a
transformed
frau
knapf
then
does
she
don
a
bright
blue
silk
waist
and
a
velvet
coat
that
is
dripping
with
jet
and
a
black
bonnet
on
which
are
perched
palpitating
birds
and
plumes
then
she
and
herr
knapf
walk
comfortably
down
to
the
pabst
theater
to
see
the
german
play
by
the
german
stock
company
they
applaud
their
favorite
stout
blond
german
comedienne
as
she
romps
through
the
acts
of
a
sprightly
german
comedy
and
after
the
play
they
go
to
their
favorite
around
the
corner
there
they
have
sardellen
and
cheese
sandwiches
and
a
great
deal
of
beer
and
for
one
charmed
evening
frau
knapf
forgets
all
about
the
insides
of
geese
and
the
thickening
for
gravies
and
is
happy
many
of
these
things
frau
knapf
herself
told
me
standing
there
by
the
door
with
the
kuchen
heavy
on
her
mind
some
of
them
i
got
from
ernst
von
gerhard
when
i
told
him
about
my
visitor
and
her
errand
the
errand
was
not
disclosed
until
frau
knapf
had
caught
me
casting
a
despairing
glance
at
my
last
typewritten
page
ach
see
you
got
no
time
for
talking
to
ai
it
she
apologized
heaps
of
time
i
politely
assured
her
do
hurry
but
why
not
have
a
chair
and
be
comfortable
frau
knapf
was
not
to
be
deceived
i
go
in
a
minute
but
first
it
is
something
i
like
to
ask
you
you
know
maybe
frau
nirlanger
i
shook
my
head
but
sure
you
must
know
from
vienna
she
is
with
such
a
voice
like
a
and
the
beads
and
the
gray
gown
and
the
fringe
and
the
cigarettes
and
the
oogly
husband
finished
frau
knapf
nodding
oogly
i
agreed
is
the
name
for
it
and
so
she
is
frau
nirlanger
i
thought
there
would
be
a
von
at
the
very
whereupon
my
visitor
deserted
the
doorknob
took
half
a
dozen
stealthy
steps
in
my
direction
and
lowered
her
voice
to
a
hissing
whisper
of
confidence
it
is
more
as
a
von
i
will
tell
you
today
comes
frau
nirlanger
by
me
and
she
says
knapf
i
wish
to
buy
clothes
aber
echt
amerikanische
myself
i
do
not
know
what
is
modish
and
i
can
not
go
alone
to
buy
that
a
grand
idea
said
i
recalling
the
gray
basque
and
the
beads
ja
sure
it
is
agreed
frau
knapf
she
asks
me
was
it
some
lady
who
would
come
with
her
by
the
stores
to
help
a
hat
and
suit
and
dresses
to
buy
stylish
she
likes
they
should
be
and
echt
amerikanisch
i
say
to
her
i
would
go
myself
with
you
only
so
awful
stylish
i
ai
and
anyway
i
got
no
time
but

stylish

raised
admiring
hands
and
eyes
toward
heaven
such
a
nice
lady
she
is
and
stylish
like
anything
and
her
name
is
frau
oh

i
murmured
in
blushing
confusion
sure
it
is
so
insisted
frau
knapf
coming
a
step
nearer
and
sinking
her
voice
one
hiss
lower
you
should
say
i
said
it
but
frau
nirlanger
likes
she
should
look
young
for
her
husband
he
is
much
younger
as
she
is
aber
much
anyhow
ten
years
frau
nirlanger
does
not
tell
me
this
but
from
other
people
i
have
found
frau
knapf
shook
her
head
mysteriously
a
great
many
times
but
maybe
you
ai
got
such
an
interest
in
frau
nirlanger
yes
interest
i
eaten
up
with
curiosity
you
sha
leave
this
room
alive
until
you
told
me
frau
knapf
shook
with
silent
mirth
now
you
make
jokings
ai
well
i
tell
you
in
vienna
frau
nirlanger
was
a
widow
from
a
family
aber
hoch
edel
very
high
born
from
the
court
her
family
is
and
friends
from
the
emperor
und
alles
sure
frau
nirlanger
she
is
different
from
the
rest
books
she
likes
und
meetings
und
all
such
komisch
things
and
what
you
think
i
do
know
i
gasped
hanging
on
her
words
what
do
i
think
she
meets
this
here
konrad
nirlanger
and
falls
with
him
in
love
und
her
family
is
mad
but
schrecklich
mad
forty
years
old
she
is
and
from
a
noble
family
and
konrad
nirlanger
is
only
a
student
from
a
university
and
he
comes
from
the
volk
sehr
gebildet
he
is
but
not
high
born
she
runs
with
him
away
and
is
shamelessly
i
drank
it
all
in
you
do
mean
it
well
then
what
happened
she
ran
away
with
him
with
that
chin
and
then
what
frau
knapf
was
enjoying
it
as
much
as
i
she
drew
a
long
breath
felt
of
the
knob
of
hair
and
plunged
once
more
into
the
story
like
a
it
is
nicht
well
frau
nirlanger
she
has
already
a
boy
who
is
ten
years
old
and
a
fine
sum
of
money
that
her
first
husband
left
her
aber
when
she
runs
with
this
poor
kerl
away
from
her
family
and
her
first
husband
family
is
so
schrecklich
mad
that
they
try
by
law
to
take
from
her
her
boy
and
her
money
because
she
has
her
highborn
family
disgraced
you
see
for
a
year
they
fight
in
the
courts
and
then
it
stands
that
her
money
frau
nirlanger
can
keep
but
her
boy
she
can
not
have
he
will
be
taken
by
her
highborn
family
and
educated
and
he
must
forget
all
about
his
mamma
to
cry
it
is
ai
it
das
arme
kind
well
she
can
stand
it
no
longer
to
live
where
her
boy
is
and
not
to
see
him
konrad
nirlanger
he
gets
a
chance
to
come
by
amerika
where
there
is
a
big
engineering
plant
here
in
milwaukee
and
she
begs
her
husband
he
should
come
because
this
boy
she
loves
very
much
oh
she
loves
her
young
husband
too
but
different
yes
oh
yes
i
agreed
remembering
the
gay
little
trilling
laugh
and
the
face
that
was
so
young
when
animated
and
so
old
and
worn
in
repose
oh
yes
quite
quite
frau
knapf
smoothed
her
spotless
skirt
and
shook
her
head
slowly
and
sadly
by
amerika
they
come
and
konrad
nirlanger
he
is
maybe
a
little
cross
and
so
because
for
a
year
they
have
been
in
the
courts
and
it
might
have
been
the
money
they
would
lose
and
for
money
konrad
nirlanger
cares
well
you
shall
see
but
frau
nirlanger
must
not
mourn
and
cry
she
must
laugh
and
sing
and
be
gay
for
her
husband
but
frau
nirlanger
has
no
grand
clothes
for
first
she
runs
away
with
konrad
nirlanger
and
then
her
money
is
tied
in
the
law
now
she
has
again
her
money
and
she
must
be
young
but
young
with
a
gesture
that
expressed
a
world
of
pathos
and
futility
frau
knapf
flung
out
her
arms
he
must
not
see
that
she
looks
different
as
the
ladies
in
this
country
so
frau
nirlanger
wants
she
should
buy
here
in
the
stores
new
dresses
echt
amerikanische
all
new
and
beautiful
things
she
would
have
because
she
must
look
young
ai
it
and
perhaps
her
boy
will
remember
her
when
he
is
a
fine
young
man
if
she
is
yet
young
when
he
grows
up
you
see
and
too
there
is
the
young
husband
first
she
gives
up
her
old
life
and
her
friends
and
her
family
for
this
man
and
then
she
must
do
all
things
to
keep
him
men
they
are
but
children
after
all
spake
the
wise
frau
knapf
in
conclusion
they
war
and
cry
and
plead
for
that
which
they
would
have
and
when
they
have
won
then
see
they
are
amused
for
a
moment
and
the
new
toy
is
thrown
poor
plain
vivacious
fascinating
little
frau
nirlanger
i
said
i
wonder
just
how
much
of
pain
and
heartache
that
little
musical
laugh
of
hers
conceals
ja
that
is
so
mused
frau
knapf
her
eyes
look
like
eyes
that
have
wept
much
not
and
so
you
will
be
so
kind
and
go
maybe
to
select
the
so
beautiful
clothes
clothes
i
repeated
remembering
the
original
errand
but
dear
lady
how
does
one
select
clothes
for
a
woman
of
forty
who
would
not
weary
her
husband
that
is
a
task
for
a
french
modiste
a
wizard
and
a
fairy
godmother
all
rolled
into
but
you
will
do
it
yes
urged
frau
knapf
i
do
it
i
agreed
a
bit
ruefully
if
only
to
see
the
face
of
the
oogly
husband
when
his
bride
is
properly
corseted
and
whereupon
frau
knapf
in
a
panic
remembered
the
unset
kuchen
dough
and
rushed
away
with
her
hand
on
her
lips
and
her
eyes
big
with
secrecy
and
i
sat
staring
at
the
last
typewritten
page
stuck
in
my
typewriter
and
i
found
that
the
little
letters
on
the
white
page
were
swimming
in
a
dim
purple
haze
chapter
x
a
tragedy
of
gowns
from
husbands
in
general
and
from
oogly
german
husbands
in
particular
may
hymen
defend
me
never
again
will
i
attempt
to
select
echt
amerikanische
clothes
for
a
woman
who
must
not
weary
her
young
husband
but
how
was
i
to
know
that
the
harmless
little
shopping
expedition
would
resolve
itself
into
a
domestic
tragedy
with
herr
nirlanger
as
the
villain
frau
nirlanger
as
the
persecuted
heroine
and
i
as
what
is
it
in
tragedy
that
corresponds
to
the
innocent
bystander
in
real
life
that
would
be
my
role
the
purchasing
of
the
clothes
was
a
real
joy
next
to
buying
pretty
things
for
myself
there
is
nothing
i
like
better
than
choosing
them
for
some
one
else
and
when
that
some
one
else
happens
to
be
a
fascinating
little
foreigner
who
coos
over
the
silken
stuffs
in
a
delightful
mixture
of
german
and
english
and
especially
when
that
some
one
else
must
be
made
to
look
so
charming
that
she
will
astonish
her
oogly
husband
then
does
the
selecting
of
those
pretty
things
cease
to
be
a
task
and
become
an
art
it
was
to
be
a
complete
surprise
to
herr
nirlanger
he
was
to
know
nothing
of
it
until
everything
was
finished
and
frau
nirlanger
dressed
in
the
prettiest
of
the
pretty
amerikanisch
gowns
was
ready
to
astound
him
when
he
should
come
home
from
the
office
of
the
vast
plant
where
he
solved
engineering
problems
from
my
own
money
i
buy
all
this
frau
nirlanger
confided
to
me
with
a
gay
little
laugh
of
excitement
as
we
started
out
from
vienna
it
comes
always
i
have
given
it
at
once
to
my
husband
as
a
wife
should
yesterday
it
came
but
i
said
nothing
and
when
my
husband
said
to
me
did
not
the
money
come
as
usual
it
is
time
i
told
a
little
lie
but
a
little
one
is
it
not
very
amusing
it
was
almost
i
did
laugh
na
he
will
not
be
cross
when
he
see
how
his
wife
like
the
amerikanische
ladies
will
look
he
admires
very
much
the
ladies
of
amerika
many
times
he
has
said
i
wager
he
has
the
great
ugly
boor
i
thought
in
parenthesis
we
show
him
i
said
aloud
he
wo
know
you
such
a
lot
of
beautiful
clothes
as
we
can
buy
with
all
this
money
oh
dear
frau
nirlanger
it
going
to
be
slathers
of
fun
i
feel
as
excited
about
it
as
though
it
were
a
trousseau
we
were
so
it
is
she
replied
a
little
shadow
of
sadness
falling
across
the
brightness
of
her
face
i
had
no
proper
clothes
when
we
were
married
but
nothing
you
know
perhaps
my
story
in
america
everyone
knows
everything
it
is
wonderful
when
i
ran
away
to
marry
konrad
nirlanger
i
had
only
the
dress
which
i
wore
even
that
i
borrowed
from
one
of
the
upper
servants
on
a
pretext
so
that
no
one
should
recognize
me
ach
gott
i
need
not
have
worried
so
you
see
it
will
be
after
all
a
why
oh
why
should
a
woman
with
her
graceful
carriage
and
pretty
vivacity
have
been
cursed
with
such
an
lot
of
features
especially
when
certain
boorish
young
husbands
have
expressed
an
admiration
for
effects
in
femininity
never
mind
mr
husband
i
show
yez
i
resolved
as
the
elevator
left
us
at
the
floor
where
waxen
ladies
in
shining
glass
cases
smiled
amiably
all
the
day
there
must
be
no
violent
pinks
or
blues
brown
was
too
old
she
was
not
young
enough
for
black
violet
was
too
trying
and
so
the
gowns
began
to
strew
tables
and
chairs
and
racks
and
still
i
shook
my
head
and
frau
nirlanger
looked
despairing
and
the
and
real
saleswoman
began
to
develop
a
baleful
gleam
about
the
eyes
and
then
we
found
it
it
was
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
the
unimaginative
would
have
called
it
gray
the
thoughtless
would
have
pronounced
it
pink
it
was
neither
and
both
a
soft
mixture
of
the
two
like
the
sky
that
one
sometimes
sees
at
winter
twilight
the
pink
of
the
sunset
veiled
by
the
gray
of
the
snow
clouds
it
was
of
a
supple
shining
cloth
simple
in
cut
graceful
in
lines
there
we
found
it
let
pray
that
it
will
not
require
too
much
but
when
it
had
been
slipped
over
her
head
we
groaned
at
the
inadequacy
of
her
stays
there
followed
a
flying
visit
to
the
department
where
hips
were
whisked
out
of
sight
in
a
jiffy
and
where
lines
miraculously
took
the
place
of
curves
then
came
the
gown
once
more
over
the
new
stays
this
time
the
effect
was
magical
the
saleswoman
and
i
clasped
hands
and
fell
back
in
attitudes
of
admiration
frau
nirlanger
turned
this
way
and
that
before
the
long
mirror
and
chattered
like
a
pleased
child
her
adjectives
grew
into
words
of
six
syllables
she
cooed
over
the
stuff
in
little
broken
exclamations
in
french
and
german
then
came
a
straight
and
simple
street
suit
of
blue
cloth
a
lingerie
gown
of
white
hats
shoes
and
even
a
couple
of
limp
satin
petticoats
the
day
was
gone
before
we
could
finish
i
bullied
them
into
promising
the
gown
for
the
next
afternoon
sooch
funs
giggled
frau
nirlanger
and
how
it
makes
one
tired
so
kind
you
were
to
take
this
trouble
for
me
me
i
could
never
have
warred
with
that
fraulein
who
served
us
so
haughty
she
was
nicht
but
it
is
good
again
pretty
clothes
to
have
pretty
gowns
i
lofe
you
also
not
indeed
i
do
lofe
but
my
money
comes
to
me
in
a
yellow
pay
envelope
and
it
is
spent
before
it
reaches
me
as
a
rule
it
leave
much
of
a
margin
for
general
a
tiny
sigh
came
from
frau
nirlanger
there
will
be
little
to
give
to
konrad
this
time
so
much
money
they
cost
those
clothes
but
konrad
he
will
not
care
when
he
sees
the
so
beautiful
dresses
is
it
not
so
care
i
cried
with
a
great
deal
of
bravado
although
a
tiny
inner
voice
spake
in
doubt
certainly
not
how
could
he
next
day
the
boxes
came
and
we
smuggled
them
into
my
room
the
unwrapping
of
the
tissue
paper
folds
was
a
ceremony
we
reveled
in
the
very
crackle
of
it
i
had
scuttled
home
from
the
office
as
early
as
decency
would
permit
in
order
to
have
plenty
of
time
for
the
dressing
it
must
be
quite
finished
before
herr
nirlanger
should
arrive
frau
nirlanger
had
purchased
three
tickets
for
the
german
theater
also
as
a
surprise
and
i
was
to
accompany
the
happily
surprised
husband
and
the
proud
little
wife
of
the
new
amerikanische
clothes
i
coaxed
her
to
let
me
do
things
to
her
hair
usually
she
wore
a
stiff
and
ugly
coiffure
that
could
only
be
described
as
a
chignon
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
seen
a
chignon
but
i
know
that
it
must
look
like
that
i
was
thankful
for
my
irish
deftness
of
fingers
as
i
stepped
back
to
view
the
result
of
my
labors
the
new
arrangement
of
the
hair
gave
her
features
a
new
softness
and
dignity
we
came
to
the
lacing
of
the
stays
with
their
exaggerated
length
aber
exclaimed
frau
nirlanger
not
daring
to
laugh
because
of
the
strange
snugness
ach
and
again
aber
to
laugh
it
is
we
had
decided
the
prettiest
of
the
new
gowns
must
do
honor
to
the
occasion
this
shade
is
called
ashes
of
roses
i
explained
as
i
slipped
it
over
her
head
ashes
of
roses
she
echoed
how
pretty
yes
but
a
little
sad
too
is
it
not
so
like
rosy
hopes
that
have
been
withered
ach
what
a
foolish
talk
so
now
you
will
fasten
it
please
a
real
trick
it
is
to
button
such
a
dress
so
sly
they
are
those
when
all
the
sly
fastenings
were
secure
i
stood
at
gaze
nose
is
shiny
i
announced
searching
in
a
drawer
for
chamois
and
powder
frau
nirlanger
raised
an
objecting
hand
but
konrad
does
not
approve
of
such
things
he
has
said
so
he
has
you
tell
your
konrad
that
a
chamois
skin
is
half
as
objectionable
as
a
shiny
one
come
here
and
let
me
dust
this
over
your
nose
and
chin
while
i
breathe
a
prayer
of
thanks
that
i
have
no
overzealous
husband
near
to
forbid
me
the
use
of
a
bit
of
powder
there
if
i
sez
it
mesilf
as
should
yez
a
credit
t
me
me
you
are
satisfied
there
is
not
one
small
thing
awry
ach
how
we
shall
laugh
at
konrad
satisfied
i
kiss
you
if
i
were
afraid
that
i
should
muss
you
up
you
not
the
same
woman
you
look
like
a
girl
and
so
pretty
now
skedaddle
into
your
own
rooms
but
do
you
dare
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
i
going
down
to
get
frau
knapf
before
your
husband
but
is
there
then
time
inquired
frau
nirlanger
he
should
be
here

bring
her
up
in
a
jiffy
just
for
one
peep
she
wo
know
you
her
face
will
be
a
treat
do
touch
your
hair
it
quite
perfect
and
jawn
sake
do
twist
around
to
look
at
yourself
in
the
back
or
something
will
burst
i
know
it
will
i
be
back
in
a
minute
now
run
the
slender
graceful
figure
disappeared
with
a
gay
little
laugh
and
i
flew
downstairs
for
frau
knapf
she
was
discovered
with
a
spoon
in
one
hand
and
a
spluttering
saucepan
in
the
other
i
detached
her
from
them
clasped
her
big
capable
red
hands
and
dragged
her
up
the
stairs
explaining
as
i
went
now
do
fuss
about
that
supper
let
wait
you
must
see
her
before
herr
nirlanger
comes
home
he
due
any
minute
she
looks
like
a
girl
so
young
and
actually
pretty
and
her
figure
divine
funny
what
a
difference
a
decent
pair
of
corsets
and
a
gown
and
some
puffs
will
make
h
frau
knapf
was
panting
as
i
pulled
her
after
me
in
swift
eagerness
between
puffs
she
brought
out
exclamations
of
surprise
and
unbelief
such
as
unmoglich
puff
puff
aber
wunderbar
puff
puff
we
stopped
before
frau
nirlanger
door
i
struck
a
dramatic
pose
prepare
i
cried
grandly
and
threw
open
the
door
with
a
bang
crouched
against
the
wall
at
a
far
corner
of
the
room
was
frau
nirlanger
her
hands
were
clasped
over
her
breast
and
her
eyes
were
dilated
as
though
she
had
been
running
in
the
center
of
the
room
stood
konrad
nirlanger
and
on
his
oogly
face
was
the
very
oogliest
look
that
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
man
he
glanced
at
us
as
we
stood
transfixed
in
the
doorway
and
laughed
a
short
sneering
laugh
that
was
like
a
stinging
blow
on
the
cheek
so
he
said
and
i
would
not
have
believed
that
men
really
said
so
in
that
way
outside
of
a
melodrama
so
you
are
in
the
little
surprise
yes
you
carry
your
meddling
outside
of
your
newspaper
work
eh
i
leave
behind
me
an
old
wife
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
presto
i
find
a
young
bride
wonderful
but
wonderful
he
laughed
an
unmusical
and
mirthless
laugh
but
do
you
like
it
i
asked
like
a
simpleton
frau
nirlanger
seemed
to
shrink
before
our
very
eyes
so
that
the
pretty
gown
hung
in
limp
folds
about
her
i
stared
fascinated
at
konrad
nirlanger
cruel
face
with
its
little
eyes
that
were
too
close
together
and
its
chin
that
curved
in
below
the
mouth
and
out
again
so
grotesquely
like
it
sneered
konrad
nirlanger
for
a
young
girl
yes
but
how
useless
this
belated
trousseau
what
a
waste
of
good
money
for
see
a
young
wife
i
do
not
want
young
women
one
can
have
in
plenty
always
but
i
have
an
old
woman
married
and
for
an
old
woman
the
gowns
need
be
few
eh
frau
orme
and
you
too
frau
knapf
frau
knapf
crimson
and
staring
was
dumb
there
came
a
little
shivering
moan
from
the
figure
crouched
in
the
corner
and
frau
nirlanger
her
face
queerly
withered
and
ashen
crumpled
slowly
in
a
little
heap
on
the
floor
and
buried
her
shamed
head
in
her
arms
konrad
nirlanger
turned
to
his
wife
the
black
look
on
his
face
growing
blacker
come
get
up
anna
he
ordered
in
german
these
heroics
become
not
a
woman
of
your
years
and
too
you
must
not
ruin
the
so
costly
gown
that
will
be
returned
frau
nirlanger
white
face
was
lifted
from
the
shelter
of
her
arms
the
stricken
look
was
still
upon
it
but
there
was
no
cowering
in
her
attitude
now
slowly
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
had
not
realized
that
she
was
so
tall
the
gown
does
not
go
back
she
said
so
he
snarled
with
a
savage
note
in
his
voice
now
hear
me
there
shall
be
no
more
buying
of
gowns
and
fripperies
you
hear
it
is
for
the
wife
to
come
to
the
husband
for
the
money
not
for
her
to
waste
it
wantonly
on
gowns
like
a
creature
of
the
streets
you
his
voice
was
an
insult
you
with
your
wrinkles
and
your
faded
eyes
in
a
gown
of
he
turned
inquiringly
toward
me
how
does
one
call
it
that
color
frau
orme
there
came
a
blur
of
tears
to
my
eyes
it
is
called
ashes
of
roses
i
answered
ashes
of
konrad
nirlanger
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
a
laugh
as
stinging
as
a
ashes
of
roses
so
it
is
well
named
for
my
dear
wife
it
is
poetically
fit
is
it
not
so
for
see
her
roses
are
but
withered
ashes
eh
anna
deliberately
and
in
silence
anna
nirlanger
walked
to
the
mirror
and
stood
there
gazing
at
the
woman
in
the
glass
there
was
something
dreadful
and
portentous
about
the
calm
and
studied
deliberation
with
which
she
critically
viewed
that
reflection
she
lifted
her
arms
slowly
and
patted
into
place
the
locks
that
had
become
disarranged
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
to
study
the
effect
then
she
took
from
a
drawer
the
bit
of
chamois
skin
that
i
had
given
her
and
passed
it
lightly
over
her
eyelids
and
cheeks
humming
softly
to
herself
the
while
no
music
ever
sounded
so
uncanny
to
my
ears
the
woman
before
the
mirror
looked
at
the
woman
in
the
mirror
with
a
long
steady
measuring
look
then
slowly
and
deliberately
the
long
graceful
folds
of
her
lovely
gown
trailing
behind
her
she
walked
over
to
where
her
frowning
husband
stood
so
might
a
queen
have
walked
head
held
high
gaze
steady
she
stopped
within
half
a
foot
of
him
her
eyes
level
with
his
for
a
long
they
stood
thus
the
faded
blue
eyes
of
the
wife
gazing
into
the
sullen
black
eyes
of
the
husband
and
his
were
the
first
to
drop
for
all
the
noble
blood
in
anna
nirlanger
veins
and
all
her
long
line
of
gently
bred
ancestors
were
coming
to
her
aid
in
dealing
with
her
husband
you
forget
she
said
very
slowly
and
distinctly
if
this
were
austria
instead
of
amerika
you
would
not
forget
in
austria
people
of
your
class
do
not
speak
in
this
manner
to
those
of
my
unsinn
laughed
konrad
nirlanger
this
is
yes
said
anna
nirlanger
this
is
amerika
and
in
amerika
all
things
are
different
i
see
now
that
my
people
knew
of
what
they
spoke
when
they
called
me
mad
to
think
of
wedding
a
clod
of
the
people
such
as
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
strike
her
i
think
he
would
have
if
she
had
flinched
but
she
did
not
her
head
was
held
high
and
her
eyes
did
not
waver
i
married
you
for
love
it
is
most
comical
is
it
not
with
you
i
thought
i
should
find
peace
and
happiness
and
a
of
the
intellect
that
was
being
smothered
in
the
splendor
and
artificiality
and
the
restrictions
of
my
life
there
well
i
was
wrong
but
wrong
now
hear
me
her
voice
was
tense
with
passion
there
will
be
gowns
as
many
and
as
rich
as
i
choose
you
have
said
many
times
that
the
ladies
of
amerika
you
admire
and
see
i
shall
be
also
one
of
those
ladies
my
money
shall
go
for
gowns
for
hats
for
trifles
of
lace
and
velvet
and
fur
you
shall
learn
that
it
is
not
a
peasant
woman
whom
you
have
married
this
is
amerika
the
land
of
the
free
my
husband
and
see
who
is
more
of
amerika
than
i
who
she
laughed
a
high
little
laugh
and
came
over
to
me
taking
my
hands
in
her
own
dear
girl
you
must
run
quickly
and
dress
for
this
evening
we
go
to
the
theater
oh
but
you
must
there
shall
be
no
unpleasantness
that
i
promise
my
husband
accompanies
us
with
joy
is
it
not
so
konrad
with
joy
so
wildly
i
longed
to
decline
but
i
dared
not
so
i
only
nodded
for
fear
of
the
great
lump
in
my
throat
and
taking
frau
knapf
hand
i
turned
and
fled
with
her
frau
knapf
was
muttering
du
hund
du
unverschamter
hund
du
in
good
billingsgate
german
and
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
and
i
dressed
with
trembling
fingers
because
i
dared
not
otherwise
face
the
brave
little
austrian
the
plucky
little
aborigine
who
with
the
donning
of
the
new
amerikanische
gown
had
acquired
some
real
amerikanisch
nerve
chapter
xi
von
gerhard
speaks
of
von
gerhard
i
had
not
had
a
glimpse
since
that
evening
of
my
hysterical
outburst
on
christmas
day
there
had
come
a
box
of
roses
so
huge
that
i
could
not
find
vases
enough
to
hold
its
contents
although
i
pressed
into
service
everything
from
mason
jars
from
the
kitchen
to
atrocities
from
the
parlor
after
i
had
given
posies
to
frau
nirlanger
and
fastened
a
rose
in
frau
knapf
hard
knob
of
hair
where
it
bobbed
in
ludicrous
discomfort
i
still
had
enough
to
fill
the
washbowl
my
room
looked
like
a
grand
opera
star
boudoir
when
she
is
expecting
the
newspaper
reporters
i
reveled
in
the
glowing
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
and
felt
very
eastern
and
luxurious
and
popular
it
had
been
a
busy
happy
week
in
which
i
had
had
to
snatch
odd
moments
for
the
selecting
of
certain
wonderful
toys
for
the
spalpeens
there
had
been
dolls
and
and
a
marvelous
miniature
kitchen
for
the
practical
and
stolid
sheila
and
ingenious
bits
of
mechanism
that
did
unbelievable
things
when
wound
up
for
the
clever
imaginative
hans
i
was
not
to
have
the
joy
of
seeing
their
delight
but
i
knew
that
there
would
follow
certain
laboriously
scrawled
letters
filled
with
capitals
and
crazily
leaning
words
of
thanks
to
the
doting
old
auntie
who
had
been
such
good
fun
the
summer
before
christmases
had
become
an
old
story
i
had
learned
to
accept
them
even
to
those
obscure
and
foreign
parts
of
turkey
which
are
seen
only
on
plates
and
which
would
be
recognized
nowhere
else
as
belonging
to
that
stately
bird
christmas
at
knapf
had
been
a
happy
surprise
a
day
of
hearty
good
cheer
and
kindness
there
had
even
been
a
christmas
tree
hung
with
stodgy
german
angels
and
pfeffernuesse
and
cakes
i
found
myself
the
bewildered
recipient
of
gifts
from
everyone
from
the
knapfs
and
the
aborigines
and
even
from
one
of
the
wives
the
aborigine
whom
they
called
fritz
had
presented
me
with
a
huge
and
imposing
lebkuchen
reposing
in
a
box
with
frilled
border
ornamented
with
quaint
little
german
figures
in
sugar
and
labeled
nurnberg
in
stout
letters
for
it
had
come
all
the
way
from
that
city
the
lebkuchen
i
placed
on
my
mantel
shelf
as
befitted
so
magnificent
a
work
of
art
it
was
quite
too
elaborate
and
imposing
to
be
sent
the
way
of
ordinary
food
although
it
had
a
certain
tantalizingly
spicy
scent
that
tempted
one
to
break
off
a
corner
here
and
there
on
the
afternoon
of
christmas
day
i
sat
down
to
thank
von
gerhard
for
the
flowers
as
prettily
as
might
be
also
i
asked
his
pardon
a
thing
not
hard
to
do
with
the
perfume
of
his
roses
filling
the
room
for
you
i
wrote
who
are
so
wise
in
the
ways
of
those
tricky
things
called
nerves
must
know
that
it
was
only
a
mild
hysteria
that
made
me
say
those
most
unladylike
things
i
have
written
norah
all
about
it
she
has
replied
advising
me
to
stick
to
the
role
but
not
to
dress
the
part
so
when
next
you
see
me
i
shall
be
a
perfectly
safe
and
sane
comrade
in
petticoats
and
i
promise
you
no
more
so
it
happened
that
on
the
afternoon
of
new
year
day
von
gerhard
and
i
gravely
wished
one
another
many
happy
and
impossible
things
for
the
coming
year
looking
fairly
and
squarely
into
each
other
eyes
as
we
did
so
so
said
von
gerhard
as
one
who
is
satisfied
the
nerfs
are
steady
what
do
you
say
to
a
brisk
walk
along
the
lake
shore
to
put
us
in
a
new
year
frame
of
mind
and
then
a
supper
somewhere
with
a
toast
to
max
and
norah
you
saved
my
life
sit
down
here
in
the
parlor
and
gaze
at
the
oranges
while
i
powder
my
nose
and
get
into
some
street
clothes
i
have
such
a
story
to
tell
you
it
has
made
me
quite
contented
with
my
the
story
was
that
of
the
nirlangers
and
as
we
struggled
against
a
brisk
lake
breeze
i
told
it
and
partly
because
of
the
breeze
and
partly
because
of
the
story
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
when
i
had
finished
von
gerhard
stared
at
me
aghast
but
you
are
crying
he
marveled
watching
a
tear
slide
down
my
nose
i
not
i
retorted
anyway
i
know
it
i
think
i
may
blubber
if
i
choose
to
may
i
as
well
as
other
women
blubber
repeated
von
gerhard
he
of
the
careful
and
cautious
english
but
most
certainly
if
you
wish
i
had
thought
that
newspaper
women
did
not
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
they
do
often
have
the
time
if
a
woman
reporter
were
to
burst
into
tears
every
time
she
saw
something
to
weep
over
she
be
going
about
with
a
red
nose
and
puffy
eyelids
half
the
time
scarcely
a
day
passes
that
does
not
bring
her
face
to
face
with
human
suffering
in
some
form
not
only
must
she
see
these
things
but
she
must
write
of
them
so
that
those
who
read
can
also
see
them
and
just
because
she
does
not
wail
and
tear
her
hair
and
faint
she
popularly
is
supposed
to
be
a
flinty
creature
who
rampages
up
and
down
the
land
seeking
whom
she
may
rend
with
her
pen
and
gazing
upon
scenes
of
horrid
and
yet
the
little
domestic
tragedy
of
the
nirlangers
can
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
oh
that
was
quite
different
the
case
of
the
nirlangers
had
nothing
to
do
with
dawn
newspaper
reporter
it
was
just
plain
dawn
woman
who
witnessed
that
little
tragedy
mein
himmel
are
all
german
husbands
like
that
not
all
i
have
a
very
good
friend
named
max
o
max
max
is
an
angel
husband
fancy
max
and
norah
waxing
tragic
on
the
subject
of
a
gown
now
you
i
come
you
are
sworn
to
as
one
comrade
to
another
tell
me
what
sort
of
husband
do
you
think
i
should
make
eh
the
boorish
nirlanger
sort
or
the
charming
max
variety
come
tell
me
you
who
always
have
seemed
so
so
damnably
able
to
take
care
of
his
eyes
were
twinkling
in
the
maddening
way
they
had
i
looked
out
across
the
lake
to
where
a
line
of
was
piling
up
formidably
only
to
break
in
futile
wrath
against
the
solid
wall
of
the
shore
and
there
came
over
me
an
equally
futile
wrath
that
savage
unreasoning
instinct
in
women
which
prompts
them
to
hurt
those
whom
they
love
oh
you
i
began
with
von
gerhard
amused
eyes
laughing
down
upon
me
i
should
say
that
you
would
be
more
in
the
nirlanger
style
in
your
large
immovable
germansure
way
not
that
you
would
stoop
to
wrangle
about
money
or
gowns
but
that
you
would
control
those
things
your
wife
will
be
a
placid
blond
rather
plump
german
fraulein
of
excellent
family
and
no
imagination
men
of
your
type
always
select
negative
wives
twenty
years
ago
she
would
have
run
to
bring
you
your
zeitung
and
your
slippers
she
would
be
that
kind
if
husbands
still
were
in
existence
you
will
be
fond
of
her
in
a
patronizing
sort
of
way
and
she
will
never
know
the
difference
between
that
and
being
loved
not
having
a
great
deal
of
imagination
as
i
have
said
before
and
you
will
go
on
becoming
more
and
more
famous
and
she
will
grow
plumper
and
more
placid
and
less
and
less
understanding
of
what
those
komisch
medical
journals
have
to
say
so
often
about
her
husband
who
is
always
discovering
things
and
you
will
live
happily
ever
after
a
hand
gripped
my
shoulder
i
looked
up
startled
into
two
blue
eyes
blazing
down
into
mine
von
gerhard
face
was
a
painful
red
i
think
that
the
hand
on
my
shoulder
even
shook
me
a
little
there
on
that
bleak
and
deserted
lake
drive
i
tried
to
wrench
my
shoulder
free
with
a
jerk
you
are
hurting
me
i
cried
a
quiver
of
pain
passed
over
the
face
that
i
had
thought
so
calmly
unemotional
you
talk
of
hurts
you
who
set
out
deliberately
and
maliciously
to
make
me
suffer
how
dare
you
then
talk
to
me
like
this
you
stab
with
a
hundred
knives
you
who
know
how
i
i
sorry
i
put
in
contritely
please
do
be
so
dreadful
about
it
after
all
you
asked
me
did
you
perhaps
i
hurt
your
vanity
there
i
did
mean
that
either
oh
dear
let
talk
about
something
impersonal
we
get
along
wretchedly
of
the
angry
red
ebbed
away
from
von
gerhard
face
the
blaze
of
wrath
in
his
eyes
gave
way
to
a
deeper
brighter
light
that
held
me
fascinated
and
there
came
to
his
lips
a
smile
of
rare
sweetness
the
hand
that
had
grasped
my
shoulder
slipped
down
down
until
it
met
my
hand
and
gripped
it
na

recht
kindchen
those
that
we
most
care
for
we
would
hurt
always
when
i
have
told
you
of
my
love
for
you
although
already
you
know
it
then
you
will
tell
me
hush
do
not
deny
this
thing
there
shall
be
no
more
lies
between
us
there
shall
be
only
the
truth
and
no
more
about
plump
blonde
german
wives
who
run
with
zeitung
and
slippers
after
all
it
is
no
secret
three
months
ago
i
told
norah
it
was
not
news
to
her
but
she
trusted
i
felt
my
face
to
be
as
white
and
as
tense
as
his
own
norah
knows
it
is
better
to
speak
these
things
then
there
need
be
no
shifting
of
the
eyes
no
evasive
words
no
tricks
no
we
had
faced
about
and
were
retracing
our
steps
past
the
rows
of
peculiarly
houses
that
line
milwaukee
magnificent
lake
shore
windows
were
hung
with
holiday
scarlet
and
holly
and
here
and
there
a
face
was
visible
at
a
window
looking
out
at
the
man
and
woman
walking
swiftly
along
the
heights
that
rose
far
above
the
lake
a
wretched
revolt
seized
me
as
i
gazed
at
the
substantial
comfort
of
those
normal
happy
homes
why
did
you
tell
me
what
good
can
that
do
at
least
we
were
friends
before
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
care
then
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
von
gerhard
replied
quietly
you
need
not
you
know
you
knew
long
long
ago
you
know
i
love
the
big
quietness
of
you
and
your
sureness
and
the
german
way
you
have
of
twisting
your
sentences
about
and
the
steady
grip
of
your
great
firm
hands
and
the
rareness
of
your
laugh
and
the
simplicity
of
you
why
i
love
the
very
cleanliness
of
your
ruddy
skin
and
the
way
your
hair
grows
away
from
your
forehead
and
your
walk
and
your
voice
and
oh
what
is
the
use
of
it
all
just
this
dawn
the
light
of
day
sweetens
all
things
we
have
dragged
this
thing
out
into
the
sunlight
where
if
it
grows
it
will
grow
sanely
and
healthily
it
was
but
an
ugly
distorted
unsightly
thing
sending
out
pale
unhealthy
shoots
in
the
dark
unwholesome
cellars
of
our
inner
consciences
norah
knowing
was
the
cleanest
sweetest
thing
about
how
wonderfully
you
understand
her
and
how
right
you
are
her
knowing
seems
to
make
it
as
it
should
be
does
it
i
am
braver
already
for
the
knowledge
of
it
it
shall
make
no
difference
between
us
there
is
no
difference
dawn
said
he
no
it
is
only
in
the
that
they
sigh
and
groan
and
utter
silly
nonsense
we
are
not
like
that
perhaps
after
a
bit
you
will
meet
some
one
you
care
for
greatly
not
plump
or
blond
or
german
perhaps
but
still
doch
you
are
flippant
i
must
say
those
things
to
keep
the
tears
back
you
would
not
have
me
wailing
here
in
the
street
tell
me
just
one
thing
and
there
shall
be
no
more
fluttering
breaths
and
languishing
looks
tell
me
when
did
you
begin
to
care
we
had
reached
knapfs
the
short
winter
day
was
already
drawing
to
its
close
in
the
von
gerhard
eyes
glowed
luminous
since
the
day
i
first
met
you
at
norah
he
said
simply
i
stared
at
him
aghast
my
sense
of
humor
struggling
to
the
surface
not
not
on
that
day
when
you
came
into
the
room
where
i
sat
in
the
chair
by
the
window
with
a
flowered
quilt
humped
about
my
shoulders
and
a
twisting
my
mouth
and
my
complexion
the
color
of
cheese
and
my
hair
plastered
back
from
my
forehead
and
my
eyes
like
boiled
onions
thank
god
for
your
gift
of
laughter
von
gerhard
said
and
took
my
hand
in
his
for
one
brief
moment
before
he
turned
and
walked
away
quite
prosaically
i
opened
the
big
front
door
at
knapfs
to
find
herr
knapf
standing
in
the
hallway
with
his
nabben
frau
and
there
was
the
sane
and
soothing
scent
of
wienerschnitzel
and
spluttering
things
in
the
air
and
i
ran
upstairs
to
my
room
and
turned
on
all
the
lights
and
looked
at
the
creature
in
the
mirror
then
i
took
the
biggest
newest
photograph
of
norah
from
the
mantel
and
looked
at
her
for
a
long
long
minute
while
she
looked
back
at
me
in
her
brave
true
way
thank
you
dear
i
said
to
her
thank
you
would
you
think
me
stagey
and
silly
if
i
were
to
kiss
you
just
once
on
your
beautiful
trusting
eyes
a
telephone
bell
tinkled
downstairs
and
herr
knapf
stationed
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
roared
my
name
when
i
had
picked
up
the
receiver
this
is
ernst
said
the
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
i
have
just
remembered
that
i
had
asked
you
for
i
would
rather
thank
god

i
replied
very
softly
and
hung
the
receiver
on
its
hook

from

and
glaring
light
is
a
little

painted
blue
and
ornamented
with
stout

roses
that
are
faded
by
time
and
much
abuse
every
evening
at

three
women

about
the
quaint
old
bed
while
its
occupant
sleeps
and
smiles
as
he
sleeps
and
clasps
to
his
breast
a
woolly
dog
for
a
new
joy
has
come
to
the
sad
little
frau
nirlanger
and
i
quite
by
accident
was
the
cause
of
bringing
it
to
her
the
queer
little
blue
bed
with
its
faded
roses
was
brought
down
from
the
attic
by

for
she
is
one
of
the
three
foster
mothers
of

small
occupant
of

the
occupant
of

and

for

purpose
of

with

and

to

o
evenings
bennie
had
been
one
of
those
little
tragedies
that
find
their
way
into
juvenile
court
bennie
story
was
common
enough
but
bennie
himself
had
been
different
ten
minutes
after
his
first
appearance
in
the
court
room
everyone
from
the
big
bald
judge
to
the
newest
probation
officer
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
somehow
you
wanted
to
smooth
the
hair
from
his
forehead
tip
his
pale
little
face
upward
and
very
gently
kiss
his
smooth
white
brow
which
alone
was
enough
to
distinguish
bennie
for
juvenile
court
children
as
a
rule
are
distinctly
not
kissable
bennie
mother
was
accused
of
being
unfit
to
care
for
her
boy
and
bennie
was
temporarily
installed
in
the
detention
home
there
the
superintendent
and
his
plump
and
kindly
wife
had
fallen
head
over
heels
in
love
with
him
and
had
dressed
him
in
a
smart
little
norfolk
suit
and
a
frivolous
plaid
silk
tie
there
were
delays
in
the
case
and
postponement
after
postponement
so
that
bennie
appeared
in
the
court
room
every
tuesday
for
four
weeks
the
reporters
and
the
probation
officers
and
policemen
became
very
chummy
with
bennie
and
showered
him
with
bright
new
pennies
and
certain
wonderful
candies
superintendent
arnett
of
the
detention
home
was
as
proud
of
the
boy
as
though
he
were
his
own
and
when
bennie
would
look
shyly
and
questioningly
into
his
face
for
permission
to
accept
the
proffered
offerings
the
big
superintendent
would
chuckle
delightedly
bennie
had
a
strangely
mobile
face
for
such
a
baby
and
the
whitest
smoothest
brow
i
have
ever
seen
the
comedy
and
tears
and
misery
and
laughter
of
the
big
court
room
were
too
much
for
bennie
he
would
gaze
about
with
puzzled
blue
eyes
then
giving
up
the
situation
as
something
too
vast
for
his
comprehension
he
would
fall
to
drawing
on
a
bit
of
paper
with
a
great
yellow
pencil
presented
him
by
one
of
the
newspaper
men
every
tuesday
the
rows
of
benches
were
packed
with
a
motley
crowd
of
poles
russians
slavs
italians
greeks
lithuanians
a
crowd
made
up
of
fathers
mothers
sisters
brothers
aunts
uncles
neighbors
friends
and
enemies
of
the
boys
and
girls
whose
fate
was
in
the
hands
of
the
big
man
seated
in
the
revolving
chair
up
in
front
but
mother
was
not
of
this
crowd
this
pitiful
ludicrous
crowd
filling
the
great
room
with
the
stifling
rancid
odor
of
the
poor
nor
was
bennie
he
sat
and
unsmiling
in
the
depths
of
a
great
chair
on
the
court
side
of
the
railing
and
gravely
received
the
attentions
of
the
lawyers
and
reporters
and
court
room
attaches
who
had
grown
fond
of
the
grave
little
figure
then
on
the
fifth
tuesday
bennie
mother
appeared
how
she
had
come
to
be
that
child
mother
god
only
knows
or
perhaps
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
was
terribly
sober
and
frightened
her
face
was
swollen
and
bruised
and
beneath
one
eye
there
was
a
puffy
swelling
her
sordid
story
was
common
enough
as
the
probation
officer
told
it
the
woman
had
been
living
in
one
wretched
room
with
the
boy
her
husband
had
deserted
her
there
was
no
food
and
little
furniture
the
queer
feature
of
it
said
the
probation
officer
was
that
the
woman
managed
to
keep
the
boy
fairly
neat
and
clean
regardless
of
her
own
condition
and
he
generally
had
food
of
some
sort
although
the
mother
sometimes
went
without
food
for
days
through
the
squalor
and
misery
and
degradation
of
her
own
life
bennie
had
somehow
been
kept
unsullied
a
thing
apart
h
said
judge
wheeling
and
looked
at
bennie
bennie
was
standing
beside
his
mother
he
was
very
quiet
and
his
eyes
were
smiling
up
into
those
of
the
battered
creature
who
was
fighting
for
him
i
guess
have
to
take
you
out
of
this
the
judge
decided
abruptly
that
boy
is
too
good
to
go
to
the
sodden
dazed
woman
before
him
did
not
immediately
get
the
full
meaning
of
his
words
she
still
stood
there
swaying
a
bit
and
staring
unintelligently
at
the
judge
then
quite
suddenly
she
realized
it
she
took
a
quick
step
forward
her
hand
went
up
to
her
breast
to
her
throat
to
her
lips
with
an
odd
stifled
gesture
you
ai
going
to
take
him
away
from
me
no
you
would
do
that
would
you
not
for
not
for
always
you
would
do
that
you
would
judge
wheeling
waved
her
away
but
the
woman
dropped
to
her
knees
judge
give
me
a
chance
i
stop
drinking
only
do
take
him
away
from
me
do
judge
do
he
all
i
got
in
the
world
give
me
a
chance
three
months
six
months
a
year
get
up
ordered
judge
wheeling
gruffly
and
stop
that
it
wo
do
you
a
bit
of
and
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
the
woman
rose
to
her
feet
a
new
and
strange
dignity
had
come
into
her
battered
face
the
lines
of
suffering
and
vice
were
erased
as
by
magic
and
she
seemed
to
grow
taller
younger
almost
beautiful
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
slowly
and
distinctly
her
words
quite
free
from
the
blur
of
the
barroom
and
street
vernacular
i
tell
you
you
must
give
me
a
chance
you
can
not
take
a
child
from
a
mother
in
this
way
i
tell
you
if
you
will
only
help
me
i
can
crawl
back
up
the
road
that
i
traveled
i
was
not
always
like
this
there
was
another
life
before
before
oh
since
then
there
have
been
years
of
blackness
and
hunger
and
cold
and
worse
but
i
never
dragged
the
boy
into
it
look
at
him
our
eyes
traveled
from
the
woman
transfigured
face
to
that
of
the
boy
we
could
trace
a
wonderful
likeness
where
before
we
had
seen
none
but
the
woman
went
on
in
her
steady
even
tone
i
ca
talk
as
i
should
because
my
brain
is
clear
it
the
drink
when
you
drink
you
forget
but
you
must
help
me
i
ca
do
it
alone
i
can
remember
how
to
live
straight
just
as
i
can
remember
how
to
talk
straight
let
me
show
you
that
i
not
all
bad
give
me
a
chance
take
the
boy
and
then
give
him
back
to
me
when
you
are
satisfied
try
god
only
knows
how
i
try
only
do
take
him
away
forever
judge
do
do
that
judge
wheeling
ran
an
uncomfortable
finger
around
his
collar
edge
any
friends
living
here
no
no
sure
about
that
quite
now
see
here
i
going
to
give
you
your
chance
i
shall
take
this
boy
away
from
you
for
a
year
in
that
time
you
will
stop
drinking
and
become
a
decent
woman
you
will
be
given
in
charge
of
one
of
these
probation
officers
she
will
find
work
for
you
and
a
good
home
and
she
stand
by
you
and
you
must
report
to
her
if
she
is
satisfied
with
you
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
boy
goes
back
to
she
will
be
satisfied
the
woman
said
simply
she
stooped
and
taking
bennie
face
between
her
hands
kissed
him
once
then
she
stepped
aside
and
stood
quite
still
looking
after
the
little
figure
that
passed
out
of
the
court
room
with
his
hand
in
that
of
a
big
kindly
police
officer
she
looked
until
the
big
door
had
opened
and
closed
upon
them
then
well
it
was
just
another
newspaper
story
it
made
a
good
one
that
evening
i
told
frau
nirlanger
about
it
and
she
wept
softly
and
murmured
ach
das
arme
baby
like
my
little
oscar
he
is
without
a
i
told
ernst
about
him
too
and
blackie
because
i
could
not
get
his
grave
little
face
out
of
my
mind
i
wondered
if
those
who
had
charge
of
him
now
would
take
the
time
to
bathe
the
little
body
and
brush
the
soft
hair
until
it
shone
and
tie
the
gay
plaid
silk
tie
as
lovingly
as
daddy
arnett
of
the
detention
home
had
done
then
it
was
that
i
quite
unwittingly
stepped
into
bennie
life
there
was
an
anniversary
or
a
change
in
the
board
of
directors
or
a
new
coat
of
paint
or
something
of
the
kind
in
one
of
the
orphan
homes
and
the
story
fell
to
me
i
found
the
orphan
home
to
be
typical
of
its
kind
a
big
dreary
structure
the
woman
at
the
door
did
not
in
the
least
care
to
let
me
in
she
was
a
woman
with
a
hard
eye
and
as
i
told
my
errand
her
mouth
grew
fishier
and
the
eye
harder
finally
she
led
me
down
a
long
dark
airless
stretch
of
corridor
and
departed
in
search
of
the
matron
leaving
me
seated
in
the
unfriendly
reception
room
with
its
chairs
placed
stonily
against
the
walls
beneath
rows
of
red
and
blue
and
yellow
religious
pictures
just
as
i
was
wondering
why
it
seemed
impossible
to
be
holy
and
cheerful
at
the
same
time
there
came
a
down
the
corridor
the
next
moment
the
matron
stood
in
the
doorway
she
was
a
mountainous
woman
with
warts
on
her
nose
i
said
sweetly
ugh
what
a
brute
i
thought
then
i
began
to
explain
my
errand
once
more
criticism
of
the
home
no
indeed
i
assured
her
at
last
convinced
of
my
disinterestedness
she
reluctantly
guided
me
about
the
big
gloomy
building
there
were
endless
flights
of
shiny
stairs
and
endless
stuffy
airless
rooms
until
we
came
to
a
door
which
she
flung
open
disclosing
the
nursery
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
a
hundred
babies
babies
at
every
stage
of
development
of
all
sizes
and
ages
and
types
they
glanced
up
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
then
a
dreadful
thing
happened
every
child
that
was
able
to
walk
or
creep
scuttled
into
the
farthest
corners
and
remained
quite
quite
still
with
a
expression
of
fear
and
apprehension
on
every
face
for
a
moment
my
heart
stood
still
i
turned
to
look
at
the
woman
by
my
side
her
thin
lips
were
compressed
into
a
straight
hard
line
she
said
a
word
to
a
nurse
standing
near
and
began
to
walk
about
eying
the
children
sharply
she
put
out
a
hand
to
pat
the
head
of
one
mite
in
a
soiled
pinafore
but
before
her
hand
could
descend
i
saw
the
child
dodge
and
the
tiny
hand
flew
up
to
the
head
as
though
in
defense
they
are
afraid
of
her
my
sick
heart
told
me
those
babies
are
afraid
of
her
what
does
she
do
to
them
i
ca
stand
this
i
i
mumbled
a
hurried
thank
you
to
the
fat
matron
as
i
turned
to
leave
the
big
bare
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
great
black
door
i
stopped
before
it
god
knows
why
and
pointed
toward
it
what
is
in
that
room
i
asked
since
then
i
have
wondered
many
times
at
the
unseen
power
that
prompted
me
to
put
the
question
the
stout
matron
bustled
on
rattling
her
keys
as
she
walked
that
oh
that
where
we
keep
the
may
i
see
them
i
asked
again
prompted
by
that
inner
voice
there
is
only
she
grudgingly
unlocked
the
door
using
one
of
the
great
keys
that
swung
from
her
waist
the
heavy
black
door
swung
open
i
stepped
into
the
bare
room
lighted
dimly
by
one
small
window
in
the
farthest
corner
crouched
something
that
stirred
and
glanced
up
at
our
entrance
it
peered
at
us
with
an
ugly
look
of
terror
and
defiance
and
i
stared
back
at
it
in
the
dim
light
during
one
dreadful
breathless
second
i
remained
staring
while
my
heart
stood
still
then
bennie
i
cried
and
stumbled
toward
him
bennie
boy
the
little
unkempt
figure
in
its
soiled
knickerbocker
suit
the
sunny
hair
all
uncared
for
the
gay
plaid
tie
draggled
and
limp
rushed
into
my
arms
with
a
crazy
inarticulate
cry
down
on
my
knees
on
the
bare
floor
i
held
him
close
close
and
his
arms
were
about
my
neck
as
though
they
never
should
unclasp
take
me
away
take
me
away
his
wet
cheek
was
pressed
against
my
own
streaming
one
i
want
my
mother
i
want
daddy
arnett
take
me
away
i
wiped
his
cheeks
with
my
notebook
or
something
picked
him
up
in
my
arms
and
started
for
the
door
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
fat
matron
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
blocking
the
doorway
with
her
huge
bulk
i
going
to
take
him
back
with
me
please
let
me
i
take
care
of
him
until
the
year
is
up
he
sha
bother
you
any
that
is
impossible
she
said
coldly
he
has
been
sent
here
by
the
court
for
a
year
and
he
must
stay
here
besides
he
is
a
stubborn
uncontrollable
uncontrollable
he
nothing
of
the
kind
why
do
you
treat
him
as
a
child
should
be
treated
instead
of
like
a
little
animal
you
do
know
him
why
he
the
most
lovable
and
he
only
a
baby
ca
you
see
that
a
baby
she
only
stared
her
dislike
her
little
pig
eyes
grown
smaller
and
more
glittering
you
great
big
thing
i
shrieked
at
her
like
an
infuriated
child
with
the
tears
streaming
down
my
cheeks
i
unclasped
bennie
cold
hands
from
about
my
neck
he
clung
to
me
frantically
until
i
had
to
push
him
away
and
run
the
woman
swung
the
door
shut
and
locked
it
but
for
all
its
thickness
i
could
hear
bennie
helpless
fists
pounding
on
its
panels
as
i
stumbled
down
the
stairs
and
bennie
voice
came
faintly
to
my
ears
muffled
by
the
heavy
door
as
he
shrieked
to
me
to
take
him
away
to
his
mother
and
to
daddy
arnett
i
blubbered
all
the
way
back
in
the
car
until
everyone
stared
but
i
did
care
when
i
reached
the
office
i
made
straight
for
sanctum
when
my
tale
was
ended
he
let
me
cry
all
over
his
desk
with
my
head
buried
in
a
heap
of
and
my
tears
watering
his
he
sat
calmly
by
smoking
finally
he
began
gently
to
philosophize
now
girl
he
better
off
there
than
he
ever
was
at
home
with
his
mother
soused
all
the
time
maybe
he
give
that
warty
matron
friend
of
yours
all
kinds
of
trouble
yellin
for
his
i
raised
my
head
from
the
desk
oh
you
can
talk
you
did
see
him
what
do
you
care
but
if
you
could
have
seen
him
crouched
there
alone
like
a
little
animal
he
was
so
sweet
and
lovable
and
and
he
had
been
decently
washed
for
weeks
and
his
arms
clung
to
me
i
can
feel
his
hands
about
my
neck
i
buried
my
head
in
the
papers
again
blackie
went
on
smoking
there
was
no
sound
in
the
little
room
except
the
of
blackie
pipe
then
i
done
a
favor
for
wheeling
once
mused
he
i
glanced
up
quickly
oh
blackie
do
you
think
no
i
do
but
then
again
you
ca
never
tell
that
was
four
or
five
years
ago
and
the
of
past
favors
grows
dim
fast
still
if
you
through
waterin
the
top
of
my
desk
why
i
like
t
set
down
and
do
a
little
real
brisk
talkin
over
the
phone
you
quite
humbly
i
crept
away
with
hope
in
my
heart
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
secret
string
the
resourceful
blackie
pulled
but
the
next
afternoon
i
found
a
hastily
scrawled
note
tucked
into
the
roll
of
my
typewriter
it
sent
me
scuttling
across
the
hall
to
the
sporting
editor
room
and
there
on
a
chair
beside
the
desk
surrounded
by
lead
pencils
and
odds
and
ends
of
newspaper
office
paraphernalia
sat
bennie
his
hair
was
parted
very
smoothly
on
one
side
and
under
his
dimpled
chin
bristled
a
very
new
and
extremely
lively
plaid
silk
tie
the
next
instant
i
had
swept
aside
papers
brushes
pencils
books
and
bennie
was
gathered
close
in
my
arms
blackie
with
a
strange
glow
in
his
black
eyes
regarded
us
with
an
assumed
disgust
wimmin
is
all
alike
ai
it
th
truth
i
used
t
think
you
was
different
but
shucks
it
ai
so
got
t
turn
on
the
weeps
the
minute
you
tickled
or
mad
why
say
i
ai
goin
t
have
you
comin
in
here
an
dampenin
up
the
whole
place
every
little
while
it
unhealthy
for
me
sittin
here
in
the
oh
shut
up
blackie
i
said
happily
how
in
the
world
did
you
do
it
never
you
mind
the
question
is
what
you
goin
t
do
with
him
now
you
got
him
goin
t
have
a
french
bunny
for
him
or
fetch
him
up
by
hand
wheeling
appointed
a
probation
skirt
to
look
after
the
crowd
of
us
and
we
got
t
toe
the
glory
be
i
ejaculated
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
with
him
i
shall
have
to
bring
him
down
with
me
every
morning
and
perhaps
you
can
make
a
sporting
editor
out
of
nix
not
with
that
forehead
he
a
we
make
him
dramatic
critic
in
the
meantime
i
be
little
fairy
godmother
an
if
get
on
your
bonnet
i
stake
you
and
the
young
to
strawberry
shortcake
an
chocolate
ice
so
it
happened
that
a
wondering
frau
knapf
and
a
sympathetic
frau
nirlanger
were
called
in
for
consultation
an
hour
later
bennie
was
ensconced
in
my
room
very
and
wondering
but
quite
content
with
the
entrance
of
frau
nirlanger
the
consultation
was
somewhat
disturbed
she
made
a
quick
rush
at
him
and
gathered
him
in
her
hungry
arms
du
baby
du
she
cried
du
kleiner
and
she
was
down
on
her
knees
and
somehow
her
figure
had
melted
into
delicious
with
bennie
head
just
fitting
into
that
most
gracious
one
between
her
shoulder
and
breast
she
cooed
to
him
in
a
babble
of
french
and
german
and
english
calling
him
her
oscar
bennie
seemed
miraculously
to
understand
perhaps
he
was
becoming
accustomed
to
having
strange
ladies
snatch
him
to
their
breasts
so
said
frau
nirlanger
looking
up
at
us
is
he
not
sweet
he
shall
be
my
boy
nicht
for
one
small
year
he
shall
be
my
own
boy
ach
i
am
but
lonely
all
the
long
day
here
in
this
strange
land
you
will
let
me
care
for
him
nicht
and
konrad
he
will
be
very
angry
but
that
shall
make
no
bit
of
difference
eh
oscar
and
so
the
thing
was
settled
and
an
hour
later
three
women
were
debating
the
weighty
question
of
eggs
or
for
bennie
supper
frau
nirlanger
was
for
eggs
as
being
none
too
heavy
after
orphan
asylum
fare
i
was
for
that
being
the
prescribed
supper
dish
for
all
the
orphans
and
waifs
that
i
had
ever
read
about
from
the
wide
wide
world
to
helen
babies
and
back
again
frau
knapf
was
for
both
eggs
and
with
a
dash
of
meat
and
potatoes
thrown
in
for
good
measure
and
a
slice
or
so
of
kuchen
on
the
side
we
compromised
on
one
egg
one
glass
of
milk
and
a
slice
of
lavishly
buttered
bread
and
jelly
it
was
a
clean
sweet
bennie
that
we
tucked
between
the
sheets
we
three
women
stood
looking
down
at
him
as
he
lay
there
in
the
quaint
old
bed
that
had
once
held
the
plump
little
knapfs
you
think
anyway
he
had
enough
supper
mused
the
frau
knapf
to
school
he
will
have
to
go
yes
murmured
frau
nirlanger
regretfully
i
tucked
in
the
covers
at
one
side
of
the
bed
not
that
they
needed
tucking
but
because
it
was
such
a
comfortable
satisfying
thing
to
do
just
at
this
minute
i
said
as
i
tucked
i
rather
be
a
newspaper
reporter
than
anything
else
in
the
world
as
a
profession
is
so
broadenin
an
at
the
same
time
so
chapter
xiii
the
test
some
day
the
marriageable
age
for
women
will
be
advanced
from
twenty
to
thirty
and
the
old
maid
line
will
be
changed
from
thirty
to
forty
when
that
time
comes
there
will
be
surprisingly
few
divorces
the
husband
of
whom
we
dream
at
twenty
is
not
at
all
the
type
of
man
who
attracts
us
at
thirty
the
man
i
married
at
twenty
was
a
brilliant
morbid
handsome
abnormal
creature
with
magnificent
eyes
and
very
white
teeth
and
no
particular
appetite
at
mealtime
the
man
whom
i
could
care
for
at
thirty
would
be
the
normal
safe
and
substantial
sort
who
would
come
in
at
six
kiss
me
once
sniff
the
air
twice
and
say
mm
what
that
smells
so
good
old
girl
i
as
hungry
as
a
bear
trot
it
out
where
are
the
kids
these
are
dangerous
things
to
think
upon
so
dangerous
and
disturbing
to
the
peace
of
mind
that
i
have
decided
not
to
see
ernst
von
gerhard
for
a
week
or
two
i
find
that
seeing
him
is
apt
to
make
me
forget
peter
orme
to
forget
that
my
duty
begins
with
a
capital
d
to
forget
that
i
am
dangerously
near
the
thirty
year
old
mark
to
forget
norah
and
max
and
the
spalpeens
and
the
world
and
everything
but
the
happiness
of
being
near
him
watching
his
eyes
say
one
thing
while
his
lips
say
another
at
such
times
i
am
apt
to
work
myself
up
into
rather
a
savage
frame
of
mind
and
to
shut
myself
in
my
room
evenings
paying
no
heed
to
frau
nirlanger
timid
knocking
or
bennie
message
i
uncover
my
typewriter
and
set
to
work
at
the
thing
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
book
and
am
extremely
wretched
and
gloomy
and
pessimistic
after
this
fashion
he
probably
would
care
anything
about
you
if
you
were
free
it
is
just
a
case
of
the
fruit
that
is
out
of
reach
being
the
most
desirable
men
do
marry
frumpy
snuffy
old
things
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
men
are
marrying
anyway
certainly
not
for
love
they
marry
for
position
or
power
or
money
when
they
do
marry
think
of
all
the
glorious
creatures
he
meets
every
day
women
whose
hair
and
and
teeth
and
skin
are
a
religion
women
whose
clothes
are
a
fine
art
women
who
are
free
to
care
only
for
themselves
to
rest
to
enjoy
to
hear
delightful
music
and
read
charming
books
and
eat
delicious
food
he
does
really
care
about
you
with
your
rumpled
blouses
and
your
shabby
gloves
and
shoes
and
your
somewhat
doubtful
linen
collars
the
last
time
you
saw
him
you
were
just
coming
home
from
the
office
after
a
dickens
of
a
day
and
there
was
a
smudge
on
the
end
of
your
nose
and
he
told
you
of
it
laughing
but
you
did
laugh
you
rubbed
it
off
furiously
and
you
wanted
to
cry
cry
you
dawn
begorra
is
losin
your
sense
av
humor
you
after
doin
get
to
after
which
i
would
fall
upon
the
book
in
a
furious
futile
fashion
writing
many
incoherent
irrelevant
paragraphs
which
i
knew
would
be
cast
aside
as
worthless
on
the
sane
and
reasoning
oh
it
had
been
easy
enough
to
talk
of
love
in
a
lofty
superior
impersonal
way
that
new
year
day
just
the
luxury
of
speaking
of
it
at
all
after
those
weeks
of
repression
sufficed
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
be
impersonal
and
lofty
when
the
touch
of
a
coat
sleeve
against
your
arm
sends
little
prickling
tingling
shivers
racing
madly
through
thousands
of
too
taut
nerves
it
is
not
so
easy
to
force
the
mind
and
tongue
into
safe
sane
channels
when
they
are
forever
threatening
to
rush
together
in
an
overwhelming
torrent
that
will
carry
misery
and
destruction
in
its
wake
invariably
we
talk
with
feverish
earnestness
about
the
book
about
my
work
at
the
office
about
ernst
profession
with
its
wonderful
growth
about
norah
and
max
and
the
spalpeens
and
the
home
about
the
latest
news
about
the
weather
about
peter
orme
and
then
silence
at
our
last
meeting
things
took
a
new
and
startling
turn
so
startling
so
full
of
temptation
and
that
i
resolved
to
forbid
myself
the
pain
and
joy
of
being
near
him
until
i
could
be
quite
sure
that
my
grip
on
dawn
was
firm
unshakable
and
lasting
von
gerhard
sports
a
a
rakish
little
craft
built
long
and
low
with
racing
lines
and
a
green
complexion
and
a
nose
that
cuts
through
the
air
like
the
prow
of
a
swift
boat
through
water
von
gerhard
had
promised
me
a
spin
in
it
on
the
first
mild
day
sunday
turned
out
to
be
unexpectedly
lamblike
as
only
a
march
day
can
be
with
real
sunshine
that
warmed
the
end
of
one
nose
instead
of
laughing
as
it
tweaked
it
as
the
lying
february
sunshine
had
done
but
warmly
you
must
dress
yourself
von
gerhard
warned
me
with
no
gauzy
blouses
or
sleeveless
gowns
the
air
cuts
like
a
knife
but
it
feels
good
against
the
face
and
a
little
i
know
where
one
is
served
great
steaming
plates
of
hot
oyster
stew
how
will
that
be
for
a
lark
yes
and
so
i
had
swathed
myself
in
wrappings
until
i
could
scarcely
clamber
into
the
panting
little
car
and
we
had
darted
off
along
the
smooth
lake
drives
while
the
wind
whipped
the
scarlet
into
our
cheeks
even
while
it
brought
the
tears
to
our
eyes
there
was
no
chance
for
conversation
even
if
von
gerhard
had
been
in
talkative
mood
which
he
was
not
he
seemed
more
taciturn
than
usual
seated
there
at
the
wheel
looking
straight
ahead
at
the
ribbon
of
road
his
eyes
narrowed
down
to
mere
keen
blue
slits
i
realized
without
alarm
that
he
was
driving
furiously
and
lawlessly
and
i
did
not
care
von
gerhard
was
that
sort
of
man
one
could
sit
quite
calmly
beside
him
while
he
pulled
at
the
reins
of
a
pair
of
runaway
horses
knowing
that
he
would
conquer
them
in
the
end
just
when
my
face
began
to
feel
as
stiff
and
glazed
as
a
mummy
we
swung
off
the
roadway
and
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
that
was
to
revive
us
with
things
hot
and
soupy
another
minute
i
said
through
stiff
lips
as
i
extricated
myself
from
my
swathings
and
i
should
have
been
what
mantalini
described
as
a
demnition
body
for
pity
sake
tell
the
soup
ca
be
too
hot
nor
too
steaming
for
your
lady
friend
i
had
enough
fresh
air
to
last
me
the
remainder
of
my
life
may
i
timidly
venture
to
suggest
that
a
cheese
sandwich
follow
the
oyster
stew
i
am
famished
and
this
place
looks
as
though
it
might
make
a
speciality
of
cheese
by
all
means
a
cheese
sandwich
und
was
noch
that
fresh
air
it
has
given
you
an
appetite
nicht
wahr
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
smile
on
his
face
nor
was
the
kindly
twinkle
of
amusement
to
be
seen
in
his
eyes
that
twinkle
that
i
had
learned
to
look
for
smile
for
the
lady
i
mockingly
begged
when
we
had
been
served
you
been
owlish
all
the
afternoon
here
try
a
cheese
sandwich
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
this
mustard
tastes
so
much
better
than
the
kind
one
gets
at
home
von
gerhard
had
been
smoking
a
cigarette
the
first
that
i
had
ever
seen
in
his
fingers
now
he
tossed
it
into
the
fireplace
that
yawned
black
and
empty
at
one
side
of
the
room
he
swept
aside
the
plates
and
glasses
that
stood
before
him
leaned
his
arms
on
the
table
and
deliberately
stared
at
me
i
sail
for
europe
in
june
to
be
gone
a
year
probably
more
he
said
sail
i
echoed
idiotically
and
began
blindly
to
dab
clots
of
mustard
on
that
ridiculous
sandwich
i
go
to
study
and
work
with
gluck
it
is
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
gluck
is
to
the
world
of
medicine
what
edison
is
to
the
world
of
electricity
he
is
a
wizard
a
man
inspired
you
should
see
him
a
little
bent
grizzled
shabby
old
man
who
looks
at
you
and
sees
you
not
it
is
a
wonderful
opportunity
a
the
mustard
and
the
sandwich
and
the
table
and
von
gerhard
face
were
very
indistinct
and
uncertain
to
my
eyes
but
i
managed
to
say
so
glad
congratulate
you
very
happy
no
doubt
fortunate
two
strong
hands
grasped
my
wrists
drop
that
absurd
mustard
spoon
and
sandwich
na
i
did
not
mean
to
frighten
you
dawn
how
your
hands
tremble
so
look
at
me
you
would
like
vienna
kindchen
you
would
like
the
gayety
and
the
brightness
of
it
and
the
music
and
the
pretty
women
and
the
incomparable
gowns
your
sense
of
humor
would
discern
the
hollowness
beneath
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
and
rigid
lines
of
caste
and
military
glory
and
your
writer
instinct
would
revel
in
the
splendor
and
color
and
romance
and
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
assumed
indifference
ca
you
convey
all
this
to
me
without
grasping
my
wrists
like
a
villain
in
a
melodrama
besides
it
is
very
generous
or
thoughtful
of
you
to
tell
me
all
this
knowing
that
it
is
not
for
me
vienna
for
you
and
milwaukee
and
cheese
sandwiches
for
me
please
pass
the
but
the
hold
on
my
wrists
grew
firmer
von
gerhard
eyes
were
steady
as
they
gazed
into
mine
dawn
vienna
and
the
whole
world
is
waiting
for
you
if
you
will
but
take
it
vienna
and
happiness
with
me
i
wrenched
my
wrists
free
with
a
dreadful
effort
and
rose
sick
bewildered
stunned
my
world
my
refuge
of
truth
and
honor
and
safety
and
sanity
that
had
lain
in
ernst
von
gerhard
great
steady
hands
was
slipping
away
from
me
i
think
the
horror
that
i
felt
within
must
have
leaped
to
my
eyes
for
in
an
instant
von
gerhard
was
beside
me
steadying
me
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
he
did
not
touch
the
tips
of
my
fingers
as
he
stood
there
very
near
me
from
the
look
of
pain
on
his
face
i
knew
that
i
had
misunderstood
somehow
kleine
i
see
that
you
know
me
not
he
said
in
german
and
the
saying
it
was
as
tender
as
is
a
mother
when
she
reproves
a
child
that
she
loves
this
fight
against
the
world
those
years
of
unhappiness
and
misery
they
have
made
you
suspicious
and
lacking
in
trust
is
it
not
so
you
do
not
yet
know
the
perfect
love
that
casts
out
all
doubt
dawn
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
reasoning
and
for
the
sake
of
your
happiness
and
mine
to
divorce
this
man
peter
orme
this
man
who
for
almost
ten
years
has
not
been
your
husband
who
never
can
be
your
husband
i
ask
you
to
do
something
which
will
bring
suffering
to
no
one
and
which
will
mean
happiness
to
many
let
me
make
you
happy
you
were
born
to
be
happy
you
who
can
laugh
like
a
girl
in
spite
of
your
sorrows
but
i
sank
into
a
chair
and
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
so
that
i
might
be
spared
the
beauty
and
the
tenderness
of
his
eyes
i
tried
to
think
of
all
the
sane
and
commonplace
things
in
life
somewhere
in
my
inner
consciousness
a
cool
little
voice
was
saying
over
and
over
again
now
dawn
careful
you
come
to
the
crossroads
at
last
right
or
left
choose
now
dawn
careful
and
the
rest
of
it
all
over
again
when
i
lifted
my
face
from
my
hands
at
last
it
was
to
meet
the
tenderness
of
von
gerhard
gaze
with
scarcely
a
tremor
you
ought
to
know
i
said
very
slowly
and
evenly
that
a
divorce
under
these
circumstances
is
almost
impossible
even
if
i
wished
to
do
what
you
suggest
there
are
certain
state
laws
an
exclamation
of
impatience
broke
from
him
laws
in
some
states
yes
in
others
no
it
is
a
mere
technicality
a
trifle
there
is
about
it
a
bit
of
that
which
you
call
red
tape
it
amounts
to
nothing
to
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
a
few
months
residence
in
another
state
perhaps
these
american
laws
they
are
made
to
yes
you
are
quite
right
i
said
and
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
the
cool
insistent
little
voice
within
had
not
spoken
in
vain
but
there
are
other
laws
laws
of
honor
and
decency
and
right
living
and
conscience
that
can
not
be
broken
with
such
ease
i
can
not
marry
you
i
have
a
you
can
call
that
unfortunate
wretch
your
husband
he
does
not
know
that
he
has
a
wife
he
will
not
know
that
he
has
lost
a
wife
come
dawn
small
one
be
not
so
foolish
you
do
not
know
how
happy
i
will
make
you
you
have
never
seen
me
except
when
i
was
tortured
with
doubts
and
fears
you
do
not
know
what
our
life
will
be
together
there
shall
be
everything
to
make
you
forget
everything
that
thought
and
love
and
money
can
give
you
the
man
there
in
the
barred
room
at
that
i
took
his
dear
hands
in
mine
and
held
them
close
as
i
miserably
tried
to
make
him
hear
what
that
small
still
voice
had
told
me
there
that
is
it
if
he
were
free
if
he
were
able
to
stand
before
men
that
his
actions
might
be
judged
fairly
and
justly
i
should
not
hesitate
for
one
single
precious
moment
if
he
could
fight
for
his
rights
or
relinquish
them
as
he
saw
fit
then
this
thing
would
not
be
so
monstrous
but
ernst
ca
you
see
he
is
there
alone
in
that
dreadful
place
quite
helpless
quite
incapable
quite
at
our
mercy
i
should
as
soon
think
of
hurting
a
little
child
or
snatching
the
pennies
from
a
blind
man
cup
the
thing
is
inhuman
it
is
monstrous
no
state
laws
no
red
tape
can
dissolve
such
a
you
still
care
for
him
ernst
his
face
was
very
white
with
the
pallor
of
repressed
emotion
and
his
eyes
were
like
the
blue
flame
that
one
sees
flashing
above
a
bed
of
coals
you
do
care
for
him
still
but
yes
you
can
stand
there
quite
cool
but
quite
and
tell
me
that
you
would
not
hurt
him
not
for
your
happiness
not
for
mine
but
me
you
can
hurt
again
and
again
without
one
twinge
of
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
in
the
little
bare
a
miserable
silence
on
my
part
a
bitter
one
for
ernst
then
von
gerhard
seated
himself
again
at
the
table
opposite
and
smiled
one
of
the
rare
smiles
that
illumined
his
face
with
such
sweetness
come
dawn
almost
we
are
quarreling
we
who
were
to
have
been
so
and
sensible
let
us
make
an
end
of
this
question
you
will
think
of
what
i
have
said
will
you
not
perhaps
i
was
too
abrupt
too
brutal
ach
dawn
you
know
not
how
i
very
well
i
will
with
both
hands
i
was
clinging
to
my
courage
and
praying
for
strength
to
endure
this
until
i
should
be
alone
in
my
room
again
as
for
that
poor
creature
who
is
bereft
of
reason
he
shall
lack
no
care
no
attention
the
burden
you
have
borne
so
long
i
shall
take
now
upon
my
he
seemed
so
confident
so
sure
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
ernst
if
you
have
any
pity
any
love
for
me
stop
i
tell
you
i
can
never
do
this
why
do
you
make
it
so
terribly
hard
for
me
so
pitilessly
hard
you
always
have
been
so
strong
so
sure
such
a
staff
of
i
say
again
and
again
and
again
you
do
not
it
was
then
that
i
took
my
last
vestige
of
strength
and
courage
together
and
going
over
to
him
put
my
two
hands
on
his
great
shoulders
looking
up
into
his
drawn
face
as
i
spoke
ernst
look
at
me
you
never
can
know
how
much
i
care
i
care
so
much
that
i
could
not
bear
to
have
the
shadow
of
wrong
fall
upon
our
happiness
there
can
be
no
lasting
happiness
upon
a
foundation
of
shameful
deceit
i
should
hate
myself
and
you
would
grow
to
hate
me
it
always
is
so
dear
one
i
care
so
much
that
i
have
the
strength
to
do
as
i
would
do
if
i
had
to
face
my
mother
and
norah
tonight
i
do
ask
you
to
understand
men
are
not
made
to
understand
these
things
not
even
a
man
such
as
you
who
are
so
beautifully
understanding
i
only
ask
that
you
believe
in
me
and
think
of
me
sometimes
i
shall
feel
it
and
be
helped
will
you
take
me
home
now
von
gerhard
the
ride
home
was
made
in
silence
the
wind
was
colder
sharper
i
was
chilled
miserable
sick
von
gerhard
face
was
quite
expressionless
as
he
guided
the
little
car
over
the
smooth
road
when
we
had
stopped
before
my
door
still
without
a
word
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
leave
me
with
that
barrier
of
silence
unbroken
but
as
i
stepped
stiffly
to
the
curbing
his
hands
closed
about
mine
with
the
old
steady
grip
i
looked
up
quickly
to
find
a
smile
in
the
corners
of
the
tired
eyes
you
you
will
let
me
see
you
sometimes
but
wisdom
came
to
my
aid
not
now
it
is
better
that
we
go
our
separate
ways
for
a
few
weeks
until
our
work
has
served
to
adjust
the
balance
that
has
been
disturbed
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
write
you
and
from
that
time
until
you
sail
in
june
we
shall
be
just
good
comrades
again
and
once
in
vienna
who
knows
you
may
meet
the
plump
blond
fraulein
of
excellent
family
and
no
particular
imagination
and
then
we
both
laughed
a
bit
hysterically
because
laughter
is
after
all
akin
to
tears
and
the
little
green
car
shot
off
with
a
whir
as
i
turned
to
enter
my
new
world
of
loneliness
chapter
xiv
bennie
and
the
charming
old
maid
there
followed
a
blessed
week
of
work
a
human
warious
week
with
something
piquant
lurking
at
every
turn
a
week
so
busy
so
kaleidoscopic
in
its
quick
succession
of
events
that
my
own
troubles
and
grievances
were
pushed
into
a
neglected
corner
of
my
mind
and
made
to
languish
there
unfed
by
tears
or
sighs
news
comes
in
cycles
there
are
weeks
when
a
city
editor
tears
his
hair
in
vain
as
he
bellows
for
a
story
there
follow
days
so
bristling
with
real
live
copy
that
perfectly
good
stuff
which
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
might
be
used
to
grace
the
front
sheet
is
sandwiched
away
between
the
marine
intelligence
and
the
elgin
butter
reports
such
a
week
was
this
i
interviewed
everything
from
a
murderer
to
an
incubator
baby
the
town
seemed
to
be
running
over
with
celebrities
norberg
the
city
editor
adores
celebrities
he
never
allows
one
to
escape
uninterviewed
on
friday
there
fell
to
my
lot
a
prima
donna
an
infamous
and
a
charming
old
maid
norberg
cared
not
whether
the
celebrity
in
question
was
noted
for
a
magnificent
high
c
or
a
left
hook
so
long
as
the
interview
was
dished
up
hot
and
juicy
with
plenty
of
quotation
marks
a
liberal
sprinkling
of
adjectives
and
adverbs
and
a
cut
of
the
victim
gracing
the
top
of
the
column
it
was
long
past
the
lunch
hour
when
the
prima
donna
and
the
properly
embellished
were
snapped
on
the
copy
hook
the
prima
donna
had
chattered
in
french
the
had
jabbered
in
slang
but
the
charming
old
maid
who
spoke
milwaukee
english
was
to
make
better
copy
than
a
whole
chorus
of
prima
donnas
or
a
ring
full
of
fighters
copy
it
was
such
wonderful
stuff
that
i
could
use
it
it
was
with
the
charming
old
maid
in
mind
that
norberg
summoned
me
another
special
story
for
you
he
cheerfully
announced
no
answering
cheer
appeared
upon
my
lunchless
features
a
at
and
a
prima
donna
at
twelve
what
the
next
choice
morsel
an
aeronaut
with
another
successful
airship
or
a

has
inherited

i

savage
by

norberg
proceeded
to
outline

characteristic

away
with
a
scamp
some
years
ago
nice
old
maid
has
never
heard
of
her
since
but
she
leaves
the
gate
ajar
or
the
open
or
a
lamp
in
the
window
or
something
so
that
if
ever
she
wanders
back
to
the
old
home
she
know
she
welcome
see
sounds
like
a
moving
picture
play
i
remarked
wait
a
minute
here
the
point
the
city
wants
to
build
a
branch
library
or
something
on
her
property
and
the
nice
old
party
is
so
pinched
for
money
that
she
have
to
take
their
offer
so
the
time
has
come
when
she
have
to
leave
that
old
cottage
with
its
romance
and
its
memories
and
its
lamp
in
the
window
and
go
to
live
in
a
cheap
little
flat
see
where
the
old
will
choke
up
the
bedroom
and
the
parlor
will
be
done
in
red
and
green
i
put
in
eagerly
and
where
there
will
be
an
ingrowing
sideboard
in
the
that
fit
in
with
the
quaint
old
at
all
and
a
kitchenette
just
off
that
in
which
the
great
iron
pots
and
kettles
that
used
to
hold
the
family
dinners
will
be
monstrously
out
of
place
you
on
said
norberg
half
an
hour
later
i
stood
before
the
cottage
set
primly
in
the
center
of
a
great
lot
that
extended
for
half
a
square
on
all
sides
a
bare
enough
sight
it
was
in
the
gray
of
that
march
day
but
it
was
not
long
before
alma
pflugel
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
the
march
winds
flapping
her
neat
skirts
about
her
ankles
filled
it
with
a
blaze
of
color
as
she
talked
a
row
of
stately
hollyhocks
pink
and
scarlet
and
saffron
reared
their
heads
against
the
cottage
sides
the
chill
march
air
became
sweet
with
the
scent
of
heliotrope
and
sweet
william
and
pansies
and
bridal
wreath
the
naked
twigs
of
the
rose
bushes
flowered
into
wondrous
bloom
so
that
they
bent
to
the
ground
with
their
weight
of
crimson
and
yellow
glory
the
bare
brick
paths
were
overrun
with
the
green
of
growing
things
gray
mounds
of
dirt
grew
vivid
with
the
fire
of
poppies
even
the
wood
of
the
miraculously
was
hidden
in
a
hedge
of
green
over
which
ran
riot
the
butterfly
beauty
of
the
lavender
and
pink
and
cerise
blossoms
oh
she
did
marvelous
things
that
dull
march
day
did
plain
german
alma
pflugel
and
still
more
marvelous
were
the
things
that
were
to
come
but
of
these
things
we
knew
nothing
as
the
door
was
opened
and
alma
pflugel
and
i
gazed
curiously
at
one
another
surprise
was
writ
large
on
her
honest
face
as
i
disclosed
my
errand
it
was
plain
that
the
ways
of
newspaper
reporters
were
foreign
to
the
life
of
this
plain
german
woman
but
she
bade
me
enter
with
a
sweet
graciousness
of
manner
wondering
but
silent
she
led
the
way
down
the
dim
narrow
hallway
to
the
beyond
and
there
i
saw
that
norberg
had
known
whereof
he
spoke
a
stout
stove
glowed
cheerfully
in
one
corner
of
the
room
back
of
the
stove
a
sleepy
cat
opened
one
indolent
eye
yawned
shamelessly
and
rose
to
investigate
as
is
the
way
of
cats
the
windows
were
aglow
with
the
sturdy
potted
plants
that
german
women
coax
into
bloom
the
room
twinkled
and
shone
as
the
polished
surfaces
of
tables
and
chairs
reflected
the
rosy
glow
from
the
plethoric
stove
i
sank
into
the
depths
of
a
huge
rocker
that
must
have
been
built
for
grosspapa
pflugel
generous
curves
alma
pflugel
in
a
chair
opposite
politely
waited
for
this
new
process
of
interviewing
to
begin
but
relaxed
in
the
embrace
of
that
great
armchair
i
suddenly
realized
that
i
was
very
tired
and
hungry
and
and
that
here
was
a
great
peace
the
prima
donna
with
her
french
and
her
paint
and
her
pearls
and
the
prizefighter
with
his
slang
and
his
cauliflower
ear
and
his
diamonds
seemed
creatures
of
another
planet
my
eyes
closed
a
delicious
sensation
of
warmth
and
drowsy
contentment
stole
over
me
do
listen
to
the
purring
of
that
cat
i
murmured
oh
newspapers
have
no
place
in
this
this
is
peace
and
alma
pflugel
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
you
you
like
it
like
it
this
is
home
i
feel
as
though
my
mother
were
here
in
this
room
seated
in
one
of
those
deep
chairs
with
a
bit
of
sewing
in
her
hand
so
near
that
i
could
touch
her
cheek
with
my
alma
pflugel
rose
from
her
chair
and
came
over
to
me
she
timidly
placed
her
hand
on
my
arm
ah
i
am
so
glad
you
are
like
that
you
do
not
laugh
at
the
low
ceilings
and
the
sunken
floors
and
the
rooms
you
do
not
raise
your
eyes
in
horror
and
say
conveniences
and
why
do
you
try
striped
wall
paper
it
would
make
those
dreadful
ceilings
seem
higher
how
nice
you
are
to
understand
like
that
my
hand
crept
over
to
cover
her
own
that
lay
on
my
arm
indeed
indeed
i
do
understand
i
whispered
which
as
the
veriest
cub
reporter
can
testify
is
no
way
to
begin
an
interview
a
hundred
happy
memories
filled
the
little
low
room
as
alma
pflugel
showed
me
her
treasures
the
cat
purred
in
great
content
and
the
stove
cast
a
rosy
glow
over
the
scene
as
the
simple
woman
told
the
story
of
each
precious
relic
from
the
battered
on
the
shelf
to
the
great
mahogany
folding
table
and
sewing
stand
and
carved
bed
then
there
was
the
old
horn
lantern
that
jacob
pflugel
had
used
a
century
before
and
in
one
corner
of
the
stood
grossmutter
pflugel
behind
cupboard
doors
were
ranged
the
carefully
preserved
china
dishes
and
on
the
shelf
below
stood
the
clumsy
earthen
set
that
grosspapa
pflugel
himself
had
modeled
for
his
young
bride
in
those
days
of
long
ago
in
the
linen
chest
there
still
lay
in
neat
fragrant
folds
piles
of
the
linen
that
had
been
spun
on
that
and
because
of
the
tragedy
in
the
honest
face
bent
over
these
dear
treasures
and
because
she
tried
so
bravely
to
hide
her
tears
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
this
could
never
be
a
newspaper
story
so
said
alma
pflugel
at
last
and
rose
and
walked
slowly
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
garden
that
window
with
its
many
tiny
panes
once
had
looked
out
across
a
wilderness
with
an
indian
camp
not
far
away
grossmutter
pflugel
had
sat
at
that
window
many
a
bitter
winter
night
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
watching
and
waiting
for
the
young
husband
who
was
urging
his
across
the
ice
of
lake
michigan
in
the
teeth
of
a
raging
blizzard
the
little
room
was
very
still
i
looked
at
alma
pflugel
standing
there
at
the
window
in
her
neat
blue
gown
and
something
about
the
face
and
figure
or
was
it
the
pose
of
the
sorrowful
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
somewhere
in
my
mind
the
resemblance
haunted
me
resemblance
to
what
whom
would
you
like
to
see
my
garden
asked
alma
pflugel
turning
from
the
window
for
a
moment
i
stared
in
wonderment
but
the
honest
kindly
face
was
unsmiling
these
things
that
i
have
shown
you
i
can
take
with
me
when
i
go
but
there
and
she
pointed
out
over
the
bare
lot
there
is
something
that
i
can
not
take
my
flowers
you
see
that
mound
over
there
covered
so
snug
and
warm
with
burlap
and
sacking
there
my
tulips
and
hyacinths
sleep
in
a
few
weeks
when
the
covering
is
whisked
off
ah
you
shall
see
then
one
can
be
quite
sure
that
the
spring
is
here
who
can
look
at
a
great
bed
of
red
and
pink
and
lavender
and
yellow
tulips
and
hyacinths
and
doubt
it
with
a
quick
gesture
she
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
beckoned
me
together
we
stepped
out
into
the
chill
of
the
raw
march
afternoon
she
stood
a
moment
silent
gazing
over
the
sodden
earth
then
she
flitted
swiftly
down
the
narrow
path
and
halted
before
a
queer
little
structure
of
brick
covered
with
the
skeleton
of
a
creeping
vine
stooping
alma
pflugel
pulled
open
the
rusty
iron
door
and
smiled
up
at
me
this
was
my
grandmother
oven
all
her
bread
she
baked
in
this
little
brick
stove
black
bread
it
was
with
a
great
thick
crust
and
a
bitter
taste
but
it
was
sweet
too
i
have
never
tasted
any
so
good
i
like
to
think
of
grossmutter
when
she
was
a
bride
baking
her
first
batch
of
bread
in
this
oven
that
grossvater
built
for
her
and
because
the
old
oven
was
so
very
difficult
to
manage
and
because
she
was
such
a
young
thing
only
sixteen
i
like
to
think
that
her
first
loaves
were
perhaps
not
so
successful
and
that
grosspapa
joked
about
them
and
that
the
little
bride
wept
so
that
the
young
husband
had
to
kiss
away
the
she
shut
the
rusty
sagging
door
very
slowly
and
gently
no
doubt
the
workmen
who
will
come
to
prepare
the
ground
for
the
new
library
will
laugh
and
joke
among
themselves
when
they
see
the
oven
and
they
will
kick
it
with
their
heels
and
wonder
what
the
old
brick
mound
could
have
there
was
a
little
twisted
smile
on
her
face
as
she
rose
a
smile
that
brought
a
hot
mist
of
tears
to
my
eyes
there
was
tragedy
itself
in
that
spare
homely
figure
standing
there
in
the
garden
the
wind
twining
her
skirts
about
her
you
should
but
see
the
children
peering
over
the
fence
to
see
my
flowers
in
the
summer
she
said
the
blue
eyes
wore
a
wistful
look
all
the
children
know
my
garden
it
blooms
from
april
to
october
there
i
have
my
sweet
peas
and
here
my
roses
thousands
of
them
some
are
as
red
as
a
drop
of
blood
and
some
as
white
as
a
bridal
wreath
when
they
are
blossoming
it
makes
the
heart
ache
it
is
so
she
had
quite
forgotten
me
now
for
her
the
garden
was
all
abloom
once
more
it
was
as
though
the
spirit
of
the
flowers
had
touched
the
naked
twigs
with
fairy
fingers
waking
them
into
glowing
life
for
her
who
never
again
was
to
shower
her
love
and
care
upon
them
these
are
my
poppies
did
you
ever
come
out
in
the
morning
to
find
a
hundred
poppy
faces
smiling
at
you
and
swaying
and
glistening
and
rippling
in
the
breeze
there
they
are
scarlet
and
pink
side
by
side
as
only
god
can
place
them
and
near
the
poppies
i
planted
my
pansies
because
each
is
a
lesson
to
the
other
i
call
my
pansies
little
children
with
happy
faces
see
how
this
great
purple
one
winks
his
yellow
eye
and
laughs
her
gray
shawl
had
slipped
back
from
her
face
and
lay
about
her
shoulders
and
the
wind
had
tossed
her
hair
into
a
soft
fluff
about
her
head
we
used
to
come
out
here
in
the
early
morning
my
little
schwester
and
i
to
see
which
rose
had
unfolded
its
petals
overnight
or
whether
this
great
peony
that
had
held
its
white
head
so
high
only
yesterday
was
humbled
to
the
ground
in
a
heap
of
ragged
leaves
oh
in
the
morning
she
loved
it
best
and
so
every
summer
i
have
made
the
garden
bloom
again
so
that
when
she
comes
back
she
will
see
flowers
greet
her
all
the
way
up
the
path
to
the
door
she
will
walk
in
an
aisle
of
fragrance
and
when
she
turns
the
handle
of
the
old
door
she
will
find
it
unlocked
summer
and
winter
day
and
night
so
that
she
has
only
to
turn
the
knob
and
she
stopped
abruptly
the
light
died
out
of
her
face
she
glanced
at
me
half
defiantly
half
timidly
as
one
who
is
not
quite
sure
of
what
she
has
said
at
that
i
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
hands
in
mine
and
smiled
down
into
the
faded
blue
eyes
grown
dim
with
tears
and
watching
perhaps
who
knows
the
little
sister
may
come
yet
i
feel
it
she
will
walk
up
the
little
path
and
try
the
handle
of
the
door
and
it
will
turn
beneath
her
fingers
and
she
will
with
my
arm
about
her
we
walked
down
the
path
toward
the
arbor
bare
now
except
for
the
tendrils
that
twined
about
the
lattice
the
arbor
was
fitted
with
a
wooden
floor
and
there
were
rustic
chairs
and
a
table
i
could
picture
the
sisters
sitting
there
with
their
sewing
during
the
long
peaceful
summer
afternoons
alma
pflugel
would
be
wearing
one
of
her
neat
gingham
gowns
very
starched
and
stiff
with
perhaps
a
snowy
apron
edged
with
a
border
of
heavy
crochet
done
by
the
wrinkled
fingers
of
grossmutter
pflugel
on
the
rustic
table
there
would
be
a
bowl
of
flowers
and
a
pot
of
delicious
kaffee
and
a
plate
of
german
kaffeekuchen
and
through
the
leafy
doorway
the
scent
of
the
wonderful
garden
would
come
stealing
i
thought
of
the
cheap
little
flat
with
the
ugly
sideboard
and
the
bit
of
weedy
yard
in
the
rear
and
the
alley
beyond
that
and
the
red
and
green
wall
paper
in
the
parlor
the
next
moment
to
my
horror
alma
pflugel
had
dropped
to
her
knees
before
the
table
in
the
damp
little
arbor
her
face
in
her
hands
her
spare
shoulders
shaking
ich
kann
nicht
thun
she
moaned
ich
kann
nicht
ach
kleine
schwester
wo
bist
du
denn
nachts
und
morgens
bete
ich
aber
doch
kommst
du
a
great
dry
sob
shook
her
her
hand
went
to
her
breast
to
her
throat
to
her
lips
with
an
odd
stifled
gesture
do
that
again
i
cried
and
shook
alma
pflugel
sharply
by
the
shoulder
do
that
again
her
startled
blue
eyes
looked
into
mine
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
that
that
gesture
i
seen
it
somewhere
that
trick
of
pressing
the
hand
to
the
breast
to
the
throat
to
the
lips
oh
suddenly
i
knew
i
lifted
the
drooping
head
and
rumpled
its
neat
braids
and
laughed
down
into
the
startled
face
she
here
i
shouted
and
started
a
dance
of
triumph
on
the
shaky
floor
of
the
old
arbor
i
know
her
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
the
resemblance
haunted
and
then
as
alma
pflugel
continued
to
stare
while
the
stunned
bewilderment
grew
in
her
eyes
why
i
have
interest
in
your
own
nephew
this
very
minute
and
his
name
is
bennie
whereupon
alma
pflugel
fainted
quietly
away
in
the
chilly
little
grape
arbor
with
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
called
myself
savage
names
as
i
chafed
her
hands
and
did
all
the
foolish
futile
things
that
distracted
humans
think
of
at
such
times
wondering
meanwhile
if
i
had
been
quite
mad
to
discern
a
resemblance
between
this
simple
gentle
german
woman
and
the
battered
ragged
swaying
figure
that
had
stood
at
the
judge
bench
suddenly
alma
pflugel
opened
her
eyes
recognition
dawned
in
them
slowly
then
with
a
jerk
she
sat
upright
her
trembling
hands
clinging
to
me
where
is
she
take
me
to
her
ach
you
are
sure
sure
lordy
i
hope
so
come
you
must
let
me
help
you
into
the
house
and
where
is
the
nearest
telephone
never
mind
i
find
when
i
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
nearest
drug
store
i
spent
a
wild
ten
minutes
telephoning
the
surprised
little
probation
officer
then
frau
nirlanger
and
finally
blackie
for
no
particular
reason
i
shrieked
my
story
over
the
wire
in
disconnected
incoherent
sentences
then
i
rushed
back
to
the
little
cottage
where
alma
pflugel
and
i
waited
with
what
patience
we
could
summon
blackie
was
the
first
to
arrive
he
required
few
explanations
that
is
one
of
the
nicest
things
about
blackie
he
understands
by
leaps
and
bounds
while
others
crawl
to
comprehension
but
when
frau
nirlanger
came
with
bennie
in
tow
there
were
tears
and
exclamations
followed
by
a
little
stricken
silence
on
the
part
of
frau
nirlanger
when
she
saw
bennie
snatched
to
the
breast
of
this
weeping
woman
so
it
was
that
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
we
did
not
hear
the
approach
of
the
probation
officer
and
her
charge
they
came
up
the
path
to
the
door
and
there
the
little
sister
turned
the
knob
and
it
yielded
under
her
fingers
and
the
old
door
swung
open
and
so
she
entered
the
house
quite
as
alma
pflugel
had
planned
she
should
except
that
the
roses
were
not
blooming
along
the
edge
of
the
sunken
brick
walk
she
entered
the
room
in
silence
and
no
one
could
have
recognized
in
this
pretty
fragile
creature
the
pitiful
wreck
of
the
juvenile
court
and
when
alma
pflugel
saw
the
face
of
the
little
sister
the
poor
marred
stricken
face
her
own
face
became
terrible
in
its
agony
she
put
bennie
down
very
gently
rose
and
took
the
shaking
little
figure
in
her
strong
arms
and
held
it
as
though
never
to
let
it
go
again
there
were
little
broken
words
of
love
and
pity
she
called
her
lammchen
and
little
one
and
so
frau
nirlanger
and
blackie
and
i
stole
away
after
a
whispered
consultation
with
the
little
probation
officer
blackie
had
come
in
his
red
runabout
and
now
he
tucked
us
into
it
feigning
a
deep
disgust
i
like
to
know
where
i
enter
into
this
little
drayma
he
growled
ai
i
got
nothin
t
do
but
run
around
town
unitin
long
lost
sisters
an
orphans
now
blackie
you
know
you
would
never
have
forgiven
me
if
i
had
left
you
out
of
this
besides
you
must
hustle
around
and
see
that
they
need
not
move
out
of
that
dear
little
cottage
now
do
say
a
word
never
have
a
greater
chance
to
act
the
fairy
frau
nirlanger
hand
sought
mine
and
i
squeezed
it
in
silent
sympathy
poor
little
frau
nirlanger
the
happiness
of
another
had
brought
her
only
sorrow
and
she
had
kissed
bennie
with
the
knowledge
that
the
little
bed
with
its
faded
red
roses
would
again
stand
empty
in
the
gloom
of
the
knapf
attic
norberg
glanced
up
quickly
as
i
entered
the
city
room
get
something
good
on
that
south
side
story
he
asked
why
no
i
answered
you
were
mistaken
about
that
the
the
nice
old
maid
is
not
going
to
move
after
chapter
xv
farewell
to
knapfs
consternation
has
corrugated
the
brows
of
the
aborigines
consternation
twice
confounded
had
added
a
wrinkle
or
two
to
my
collection
we
are
homeless
that
is
we
are
knapfless
we
to
whom
the
knapfs
spelled
home
herr
knapf
mustache
aquiver
and
frau
knapf
cheek
bones
glistening
broke
the
news
to
us
one
evening
just
a
week
after
the
exciting
day
which
so
changed
bennie
life
es
thut
uns
sehr
sehr
leid
herr
knapf
had
begun
and
before
he
had
finished
protesting
german
groans
mingled
with
voluble
german
explanations
the
aborigines
were
stricken
down
they
clapped
pudgy
fists
to
knobby
foreheads
they
smote
their
breasts
and
made
wild
gestures
with
their
arms
if
my
protests
were
less
frenzied
than
theirs
it
was
only
because
my
knowledge
of
german
stops
at
words
of
six
syllables
out
of
the
chaos
of
ejaculations
and
interrogation
the
reason
for
our
expulsion
at
last
was
made
clear
the
little
german
hotel
had
not
been
remunerative
our
host
and
hostess
were
too
hospitable
and
too
polite
to
state
the
true
reason
for
this
state
of
affairs
perhaps
rents
were
too
high
perhaps
thought
i
frau
knapf
had
been
too
liberal
with
the
butter
in
the
stewed
chicken
perhaps
there
had
been
too
many
golden
pfannkuchen
with
real
eggs
and
milk
stirred
into
them
and
with
toothsome
little
islands
of
ruddy
currant
jelly
on
top
perhaps
there
had
been
too
much
honest
nourishing
food
and
not
enough
victuals
at
any
rate
the
enterprise
would
have
to
be
abandoned
it
was
then
that
the
bare
bright
little
dining
room
with
its
queer
prints
of
lieutenants
and
its
queerer
faces
and
its
german
cookery
became
very
dear
to
me
i
had
grown
to
like
frau
knapf
of
the
shining
cheek
bones
and
herr
knapf
of
the
heavy
geniality
a
close
bond
of
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
frau
nirlanger
and
me
i
would
miss
her
friendly
visits
and
her
pretty
ways
and
her
sparkling
conversation
she
and
i
had
held
many
kimonoed
and
sometimes
not
often
she
had
given
me
wonderful
glimpses
of
that
which
she
had
left
of
vienna
the
opera
the
court
the
life
which
had
been
hers
she
talked
marvelously
well
for
she
had
all
the
charm
and
vivacity
of
the
true
viennese
even
the
aborigines
bristling
pompadours
thick
spectacles
terrifying
manner
and
all
became
as
dear
as
old
friends
now
that
i
knew
i
must
lose
them
the
great
room
upstairs
had
taken
on
the
look
of
home
the
closet
no
longer
appalled
me
the
very
purpleness
of
the
purple
roses
in
the
rug
had
grown
beautiful
in
my
eyes
because
they
were
part
of
that
little
domain
which
spelled
peace
and
comfort
and
kindness
how
could
i
live
without
the
stout
yellow
brocade
armchair
its
plethoric
curves
were
balm
for
my
tired
bones
its
great
lap
admitted
of
sitting
with
knees
crossed
its
cushioned
back
stopped
just
at
the
point
where
the
head
found
needed
support
its
pudgy
arms
offered
rest
for
tired
elbows
its
yielding
bosom
was
made
for
tired
backs
given
the
padded
comfort
of
that
stout
old
chair
a
friendly
book
between
my
fingers
a
dish
of
ruddy
apples
twinkling
in
the
my
mundane
soul
snuggled
in
content
and
then
too
the
had
grown
in
that
room
it
had
developed
from
a
weak
wobbling
uncertainty
into
a
lusty
thing
that
grew
and
grew
until
it
promised
soon
to
become
mansize
now
all
this
was
to
be
changed
and
i
knew
that
i
would
miss
the
easy
german
atmosphere
of
the
place
the
kindness
they
had
shown
me
the
chattering
admiring
minna
the
dachshund
the
aborigines
with
their
pipes
and
flappy
slippers
the
wienerschnitzel
the
wives
and
the
masterful
german
husbands
the
very
darns
in
the
and
the
very
nicks
in
the
china
we
had
a
last
family
gathering
in
token
of
our
appreciation
of
herr
and
frau
knapf
and
because
i
had
not
seen
him
for
almost
three
weeks
and
because
the
time
for
his
going
was
drawing
so
sickeningly
near
and
because
i
was
quite
sure
that
i
had
myself
in
hand
and
because
he
knew
the
knapfs
and
was
fond
of
them
and
i
invited
von
gerhard
he
came
and
i
found
myself
dangerously
glad
to
see
him
so
that
i
made
my
greeting
as
airy
and
frivolous
as
possible
perhaps
i
overdid
the
airy
business
for
von
gerhard
looked
at
me
for
a
long
silent
minute
until
the
nonsense
i
had
been
chattering
died
on
my
lips
and
i
found
myself
staring
up
at
him
like
a
child
that
is
apprehensive
of
being
scolded
for
some
naughtiness
not
so
much
chatter
small
one
he
said
unsmilingly
this
pretense
it
is
not
necessary
between
you
and
me
so
you
are
ein
bischen
blasz
nicht
a
little
pale
you
have
not
been
ill
dawn
ill
never
felt
more
chipper
in
my
life
i
made
flippant
answer
and
i
adore
these
people
who
are
forever
telling
one
how
unusually
thin
or
pale
or
scrawny
one
is
na
they
are
not
to
be
satisfied
these
women
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
lovely
you
look
to
me
you
would
draw
yourself
up
with
chill
dignity
and
remind
me
that
i
am
not
privileged
to
say
these
things
to
you
so
i
discreetly
mention
that
you
are
looking
interestingly
pale
taking
care
to
keep
all
tenderness
out
of
my
tones
and
still
you
are
not
he
shrugged
despairing
shoulders
ca
you
strike
a
happy
medium
between
rudeness
and
tenderness
after
all
i
have
had
a
glimpse
of
your
blond
beauty
for
three
weeks
and
while
i
do
ask
you
to
whisper
sweet
nothings
still
after
days
you
have
been
lonely
if
only
i
thought
that
those
weeks
have
been
as
wearisome
to
you
not
lonely
exactly
i
hurriedly
interrupted
but
sort
of
wishing
that
some
one
would
pat
me
on
the
head
and
tell
me
that
i
was
a
good
doggie
you
know
what
i
mean
it
is
so
easy
to
become
accustomed
to
thoughtfulness
and
devotion
and
so
dreadfully
hard
to
be
happy
without
it
once
one
has
had
it
this
has
been
a
sort
of
training
for
what
i
may
expect
when
vienna
has
swallowed
you
you
are
still
obstinate
these
three
weeks
have
not
changed
you
ach
dawn
kindchen
but
i
knew
that
these
were
thin
spots
marked
danger
in
our
conversational
pond
so
come
said
i
i
have
two
new
aborigines
for
you
to
meet
they
are
the
very
shiniest
and
wildest
of
all
our
and
wild
aborigines
and
you
should
see
their
trousers
and
neckties
if
you
dare
to
come
back
from
vienna
wearing
trousers
like
these
and
is
the
party
in
honor
of
these
new
aborigines
laughed
von
gerhard
you
did
not
explain
in
your
note
merely
you
asked
me
to
come
knowing
that
i
cared
not
if
it
were
a
lawn
fete
or
a
ball
so
long
as
i
might
again
be
with
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
dining
room
where
the
festivities
were
to
be
held
i
stopped
and
turned
a
look
of
surprise
upon
him
do
you
know
that
the
knapfs
are
leaving
did
i
neglect
to
mention
that
this
is
a
farewell
party
for
herr
and
frau
knapf
we
are
losing
our
home
and
we
have
just
one
week
in
which
to
find
but
where
will
you
go
and
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
i
have
an
idea
where
i
shall
lay
my
poor
old
head
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
probably
for
i
do
know
how
i
shall
find
the
time
to
interview
landladies
and
pack
my
belongings
in
seven
short
days
the
book
will
have
to
suffer
for
it
just
when
it
was
getting
along
so
beautifully
there
was
a
dangerous
tenderness
in
von
gerhard
eyes
as
he
said
again
you
are
a
wanderer
eh
small
one
that
you
with
your
love
of
beautiful
things
and
your
fastidiousness
should
have
to
live
in
this
way
in
these
alone
with
not
even
the
comforts
that
should
be
yours
ach
kindchen
you
were
not
made
for
that
you
were
intended
for
the
home
with
a
husband
and
kinder
and
all
that
is
truly
worth
i
swallowed
a
lump
in
my
throat
as
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
pooh
any
woman
can
have
a
husband
and
babies
i
retorted
wickedly
but
mighty
few
women
can
write
a
book
it
a
special
and
you
prefer
this
life
this
existence
to
the
things
that
i
offer
you
you
would
endure
these
hardships
rather
than
give
up
the
nonsensical
views
which
you
entertain
toward
your
please
we
were
not
to
talk
of
that
i
am
enduring
no
hardships
since
i
have
lived
in
this
pretty
town
i
have
become
a
worshiper
of
the
goddess
gemutlichkeit
perhaps
i
sha
find
another
home
as
dear
to
my
heart
as
this
has
been
but
at
least
i
sha
have
to
sleep
on
a
park
bench
and
any
one
can
tell
you
that
park
benches
have
long
been
the
favored
resting
place
of
genius
there
is
frau
nirlanger
beckoning
us
now
do
stop
scowling
and
smile
for
the
lady
i
know
you
will
get
on
beautifully
with
the
he
did
get
on
with
them
so
beautifully
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
were
swapping
stories
of
germany
of
austria
of
the
universities
of
student
life
frau
knapf
served
a
late
supper
at
which
some
one
led
in
singing
auld
lang
syne
although
the
sounds
emanating
from
the
aborigines
end
of
the
table
sounded
suspiciously
like
die
wacht
am
rhein
following
that
the
aborigines
rose
en
masse
and
roared
out
their
german
university
songs
banging
their
glasses
on
the
table
when
they
came
to
the
chorus
until
we
all
caught
the
spirit
of
it
and
banged
our
glasses
like
rathskeller
veterans
then
the
and
amorous
fritz
he
of
the
absent
lena
announced
his
intention
of
entertaining
the
company
made
bold
by
an
injudicious
mixture
of
herr
knapf
excellent
beer
and
a
wonderful
punch
which
von
gerhard
had
concocted
fritz
mounted
his
chair
placed
his
plump
hand
over
the
spot
where
he
supposed
his
heart
to
be
fastened
his
watery
blue
eyes
upon
my
surprised
and
blushing
countenance
and
sang
weh
dass
wir
scheiden
mussen
in
an
astonishingly
beautiful
barytone
i
dared
not
look
at
von
gerhard
for
i
knew
that
he
was
purple
with
suppressed
mirth
so
i
stared
stonily
at
the
sardine
sandwich
and
dill
pickle
on
my
plate
and
felt
myself
growing
hot
and
hysterical
and
cold
and
tearful
by
turns
at
the
end
of
the
last
verse
i
rose
hastily
and
brought
from
their
the
gifts
which
we
of
knapfs
had
purchased
as
remembrances
for
herr
and
frau
knapf
i
had
been
delegated
to
make
the
presentation
speech
so
i
grasped
in
one
hand
the
too
elaborate
pipe
that
was
to
make
herr
knapf
unhappy
and
the
too
fashionable
silk
umbrella
that
was
to
appall
frau
knapf
and
ascended
the
little
platform
at
the
end
of
the
dining
room
and
began
to
speak
in
what
i
fondly
thought
to
be
fluent
and
highsounding
german
immediately
the
aborigines
went
off
into
paroxysms
of
laughter
they
threw
back
their
heads
and
roared
and
slapped
their
thighs
and
spluttered
it
appeared
that
they
thought
i
was
making
a
humorous
speech
at
that
discovery
i
cast
dignity
aside
and
continued
my
speech
in
the
language
of
a
german
vaudeville
comedian
with
a
dash
of
weber
and
field
here
and
there
with
the
presentation
of
the
silk
umbrella
frau
knapf
burst
into
tears
groped
about
helplessly
for
her
apron
realized
that
it
was
missing
from
its
accustomed
place
and
wiped
her
tears
upon
her
cherished
blue
silk
sleeve
in
the
utter
abandon
of
her
sorrow
we
drank
to
the
future
health
and
prosperity
of
our
tearful
host
and
hostess
and
some
one
suggested
drei
mal
drei
to
which
we
responded
in
a
manner
to
make
the
lieutenant
tremble
in
his
frame
on
the
wall
when
it
was
all
over
frau
nirlanger
beckoned
me
and
she
von
gerhard
and
i
stole
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
discussing
our
plans
for
the
future
and
trying
to
smile
as
we
talked
of
this
plan
and
that
frau
nirlanger
in
the
pretty
white
gown
was
looking
haggard
and
distrait
the
oogly
husband
was
still
in
the
dining
room
finishing
the
beer
and
punch
of
which
he
had
already
taken
too
much
a
tiny
apartment
we
have
taken
said
frau
nirlanger
softly
it
is
better
so
then
i
shall
have
a
little
housework
a
little
cooking
a
little
marketing
to
keep
me
busy
and
perhaps
her
hand
closed
over
mine
but
that
shall
us
not
separate
she
pleaded
without
you
to
make
me
sometimes
laugh
what
should
i
then
do
you
will
bring
her
often
to
our
little
apartment
not
she
went
on
turning
appealingly
to
von
gerhard
as
often
as
orme
will
allow
me
he
answered
ach
yes
so
lonely
i
shall
be
you
do
not
know
what
she
has
been
to
me
this
dawn
she
is
brave
for
two
always
laughing
she
is
and
merry
nicht
wahr
meine
kleine
soldatin
i
call
her
soldatin
eh
mused
von
gerhard
our
little
soldier
she
is
well
named
and
her
battles
she
fights
alone
but
quite
his
eyes
as
they
looked
down
on
me
from
his
great
height
had
that
in
them
which
sent
the
blood
rushing
and
tingling
to
my
i
brought
my

wore
a

little
look
of

as
she
gazed
at
him
and
from
him
to
the
figure
of
her
husband
who
had
just
emerged
from
the
dining
room
and
was
making
unsteady
progress
toward
us
herr

face
was
flushed
and
his
damp
dark
hair
was
awry
so
that
one
lock
straggled
limply
down
over
his
forehead
as
he
approached
he
surveyed
us
with
a
surly
frown
that
changed
slowly
into
a
leering
grin
he
lurched
over
and
placed
a
hand
familiarly
on
my
shoulder

raised
one

as
though
to
pat
my
check
and
because
of
the
horror
which
i
saw
on
the
face
of
the
woman
beside
me
i
tried
to
smile
and
did
not
shrink
from
him
but
with
a
quick
movement

clutched
the
swaying
figure
and
turned
it
so
that

began
to
climb
the
stairs
laboriously
with
frau

light
figure
flitting
just
ahead
of
him
at
the
bend
in
the
stairway
she
turned
and
looked
down
on
us
a
moment
her
eyes
very
bright
and
big
she
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
lips
and
wafted
a
little
kiss
toward
us
with
a
gesture
indescribably
graceful
and
pathetic
she
viewed
her
laborious
progress
not
daring
to
offer
help
then
the
turn
in
the
stair
hid
her
from
sight
in
the
dim
quiet
of
the
little
hallway
von

held
out
his
hands
those
deft
manual
hands
those
steady
sure
surgeonly
hands
hands
to
cling
to
to
steady
oneself
by
and
because
i
needed
them
most
just
then
and
because
i
longed
with
my
whole
soul
to
place
both
my
weary
hands
in
those
strong
capable
ones
and
to
bring
those
dear
cool
sane
fingers
up
to
my
burning
cheeks
i
put
one
foot
on
the
first
stair
and
held
out
two
chilly
fingertips
herr
doktor
i
said
and
thank
you
not
only
for
myself
but
for
her
i
have
felt
what
she
feels
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
one
von

two
hands
closed
over
that
one
of
mine

you
will
let
me
help
you
to
find
comfortable
quarters
you
can
not
tramp
about
from
place
to
place
all
the
week
let
us
get
a
list
of
addresses
and
then
with
the
machine
we
can
drive
from
one
to
the
other
in
an
hour
it
will
at
least
save
you
time
and
go
hunting
in
a
stunning
green
automobile
i
exclaimed
from
my
vantage
point
on
the
steps
i
could
look
down
on
him
and
there
came
over
me
a
great
longing
to
run
my
fingers
gently
through
that
crisp
blond
hair
and
to
bring
his
head
down
close
against
my
breast
for
one
exquisite
moment
so
landladies
and
oitermobiles
i
laughed
never
do
you
know
that
if
they
got
one
glimpse
through
the
front
parlor
windows
of
me
stepping
out
of
your
green
motor
car
they
would
promptly
me
for
any
room
in
the
house
i
shall
go
in
my
oldest
hat
with
one
finger
sticking
out
of
my
von
gerhard
shrugged
despairing
shoulders
na
of
what
use
is
it
to
plead
with
you
sometimes
i
wonder
if
after
all
you
are
not
merely
amusing
yourself
getting
copy
perhaps
for
the
book
or
a
new
experience
to
add
to
your
already
varied
abruptly
i
turned
to
hide
my
pain
and
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
with
a
bound
von
gerhard
was
beside
me
his
face
drawn
and
contrite
forgive
me
dawn
i
know
that
you
are
wisest
it
is
only
that
i
become
a
little
mad
i
think
when
i
see
you
battling
alone
like
this
among
strangers
and
know
that
i
have
not
the
right
to
help
you
i
knew
not
what
i
was
saying
come
raise
your
eyes
and
smile
like
the
little
soldatin
that
you
are
so
now
i
am
forgiven
yes
i
smiled
cheerily
enough
into
his
blue
eyes
quite
forgiven
and
now
you
must
run
along
this
is
scandalously
late
the
aborigines
will
be
along
saying
instead
of
if
we
stay
here
much
longer
you
will
give
me
your
new
address
as
soon
as
you
have
found
a
satisfactory
home
never
fear
i
probably
shall
be
pestering
you
with
telephone
calls
urging
you
to
have
pity
upon
me
in
my
loneliness
now
goodnight
again
i
as
full
of
farewells
as
a
and
to
end
it
i
ran
up
the
stairs
at
the
bend
just
where
frau
nirlanger
had
turned
i
too
stopped
and
looked
over
my
shoulder
von
gerhard
was
standing
as
i
had
left
him
looking
up
at
me
and
like
frau
nirlanger
i
wafted
a
little
kiss
in
his
direction
before
i
allowed
the
bend
in
the
stairs
to
cut
off
my
view
but
von
gerhard
did
not
signify
by
look
or
word
that
he
had
seen
it
as
he
stood
looking
up
at
me
one
strong
white
hand
resting
on
the
broad
baluster
chapter
xvi
june
moonlight
and
a
new
boardinghouse
there
was
a
week
in
which
to
scurry
about
for
a
new
home
the
days
scampered
by
tripping
over
one
another
in
their
haste
my
sleeping
hours
were
haunted
by
nightmares
of
landladies
and
impossible
bedrooms
columns
of
to
let
furnished
or
unfurnished
ads
filed
advanced
and
retreated
before
my
dizzy
eyes
my
time
after
office
hours
was
spent
in
climbing
dim
stairways
interviewing
unenthusiastic
females
in
kimonos
and
peering
into
ugly
bedrooms
papered
with
sprawly
and
impossible
patterns
and
filled
with
the
odors
of
dinners
i
found
one
room
less
impossible
than
the
rest
only
to
be
told
that
the
preference
was
to
be
given
to
a
man
who
had
looked
the
day
before
i
take
gents
only
explained
the
ample
person
who
carried
the
keys
to
the
mansion
gents
goes
early
in
the
morning
and
comes
in
late
at
night
and
that
all
you
ever
see
of
half
the
time
i
tried
ladies
an
they
get
me
wild
always
yellin
for
hot
water
to
wash
their
hair
or
pastin
handkerchiefs
up
on
the
or
wantin
to
butt
into
the
kitchen
to
press
this
or
that
i
let
you
know
if
the
gent
take
it
but
i
got
an
idea
he
he
did
at
any
rate
no
voice
summoned
me
to
that
haven
for
gents
only
there
were
other
landladies
landladies
fat
and
german
landladies
lean
and
irish
landladies
loquacious
regardless
of
nationality
landladies
reserved
landladies
husbandless
wedded
widowed
divorced
and
willing
landladies
slatternly
landladies
prim
and
all
hinting
of
past
estates
wherein
there
had
been
much
grandeur
at
last
when
despair
gripped
me
and
i
had
horrid
visions
of
my
trunk
and
typewriter
reposing
on
the
sidewalk
while
i
homeless
sat
perched
in
the
midst
of
them
i
chanced
upon
a
room
which
commanded
a
glorious
view
of
the
lake
true
it
was
too
expensive
for
my
slim
purse
true
the
owner
of
it
was
sour
of
feature
true
the
room
itself
was
cavernous
and
unfriendly
and
but
the
view
of
the
great
blue
lake
triumphed
over
all
these
although
a
cautious
inner
voice
warned
me
that
that
lake
view
would
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
i
remembered
later
how
she
of
the
sour
visage
had
dilated
upon
the
subject
of
the
sunrise
over
the
water
i
told
her
at
the
time
that
while
i
was
passionately
fond
of
sunrises
myself
still
i
should
like
them
just
as
well
did
they
not
occur
so
early
in
the
morning
whereupon
she
of
the
vinegar
countenance
had
sniffed
i
loathe
landladies
who
sniff
my
trunk
and
trusty
typewriter
were
sent
on
to
my
new
home
at
noon
unchaperoned
for
i
had
no
time
to
spare
at
that
hour
of
the
day
later
i
followed
them
laden
with
umbrella
boxes
parcels
and
other
unfashionable
paraphernalia
i
bumped
and
banged
my
way
up
the
two
flights
of
stairs
that
led
to
my
lake
view
and
my
bed
and
my
heart
went
down
as
my
feet
went
up
by
the
time
the
cavernous
bedroom
was
gained
i
felt
decidedly
so
that
i
dumped
my
belongings
on
the
floor
in
a
heap
and
went
to
the
window
to
gaze
on
the
lake
until
my
spirits
should
rise
but
it
was
a
gray
day
and
the
lake
looked
large
and
wet
and
unsociable
you
could
get
chummy
with
it
i
turned
to
my
great
barn
of
a
room
you
could
get
chummy
with
that
either
i
began
to
unpack
with
furious
energy
in
vain
i
turned
every
gas
jet
blazing
high
they
only
cast
dim
shadows
in
the
murky
vastness
of
that
awful
chamber
a
whole
fourth
of
july
fireworks
display
roman
candles
set
pieces
and
all
could
not
have
made
that
room
take
on
a
festive
air
as
i
unpacked
i
thought
of
my
cosy
room
at
knapfs
and
as
i
thought
i
took
my
head
out
of
my
trunk
and
sank
down
on
the
floor
with
a
satin
blouse
in
one
hand
and
a
walking
boot
in
the
other
and
wanted
to
bellow
with
loneliness
there
came
to
me
dear
visions
of
the
friendly
old
yellow
brocade
chair
and
the
lamplight
and
the
fireplace
and
frau
nirlanger
and
the
pfannkuchen
i
thought
of
the
aborigines
in
my
homesick
mind
their
bumpy
faces
became
things
of
transcendent
beauty
i
could
have
put
my
head
on
their
combined
shoulders
and
wept
down
their
blue
satin
neckties
in
my
memory
of
frau
knapf
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
discern
a
dim
misty
halo
hovering
above
her
tightly
wadded
hair
my
soul
went
out
to
her
as
i
recalled
the
shining
and
the
apron
and
the
chickens
stewed
in
butter
i
would
have
given
a
year
out
of
my
life
to
have
heard
that
one
aborigine
had
been
wont
to
emphasize
his
arguments
with
a
toothpick
brandished
fiercely
between
thumb
and
finger
the
brandisher
had
always
annoyed
me
now
i
thought
of
him
with
tenderness
in
my
heart
and
reproached
myself
for
my
fastidiousness
i
should
have
wept
if
i
had
not
had
a
walking
boot
in
one
hand
and
a
satin
blouse
in
the
other
a
walking
boot
is
but
a
cold
comfort
and
my
thriftiness
denied
my
tears
the
soiling
of
the
blouse
so
i
sat
up
on
my
knees
and
finished
the
unpacking
just
before
dinner
time
i
donned
a
becoming
gown
to
chirk
up
my
courage
groped
my
way
down
the
long
dim
stairs
and
telephoned
to
von
gerhard
it
seemed
to
me
that
just
to
hear
his
voice
would
instill
in
me
new
courage
and
hope
i
gave
the
number
and
waited
dr
von
gerhard
repeated
a
woman
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
he
is
very
busy
will
you
leave
your
name
no
i
snapped
i
hold
the
wire
tell
him
that
orme
is
waiting
to
speak
to
i
the
voice
was
grudging
another
wait
then
dawn
came
his
voice
in
glad
surprise
hello
i
cried
hysterically
hello
oh
talk
say
something
nice
for
pity
sake
i
sorry
that
i
taken
you
away
from
whatever
you
were
doing
but
i
could
help
it
just
talk
please
i
dying
of
child
are
you
ill
von
gerhard
voice
was
so
satisfyingly
solicitous
is
anything
wrong
your
voice
is
trembling
i
can
hear
it
quite
plainly
what
has
happened
has
norah
written
norah
no
there
was
nothing
in
her
letter
to
upset
me
it
is
only
the
strangeness
of
this
place
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
the
new
home
it
is
satisfactory
you
have
found
what
you
wanted
your
room
is
comfortable
it
it
a
large
room
i
faltered
and
there
a
a
large
view
of
the
lake
there
was
a
smothered
sound
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
then
i
want
you
to
meet
me
at
seven
we
will
have
dinner
together
von
gerhard
said
i
can
not
have
you
moping
up
there
all
alone
all
i
ca
why
because
i
want
to
so
very
much
and
anyway
i
much
more
cheerful
now
i
am
going
in
to
dinner
and
after
dinner
i
shall
get
acquainted
with
my
room
there
are
six
corners
and
all
the
space
under
the
bed
that
i
have
explored
dawn
yes
if
you
were
free
would
you
marry
me
if
you
knew
that
the
next
month
would
find
you
mistress
of
yourself
would
you
ernst
yes
if
the
gates
of
heaven
were
opened
wide
to
you
and
they
had
done
in
diamonds
over
the
door
and
all
the
loveliest
angel
ladies
grouped
about
the
doorway
to
receive
you
and
just
beyond
you
could
see
awaiting
you
all
that
was
beautiful
and
most
exquisite
and
most
desirable
would
you
enter
and
then
i
hung
up
the
receiver
and
went
in
to
dinner
i
went
in
to
dinner
but
not
to
dine
oh
shades
of
those
who
have
suffered
in
that
dining
room
it
must
have
been
patterned
after
the
dining
room
at
dotheboys
hall
it
was
bare
and
cheerless
and
fearfully
undressed
looking
the
diners
were
seated
at
two
long
unsociable
tables
that
ran
the
length
of
the
room
and
all
the
women
folks
came
down
to
dine
with
white
wool
shawls
wrapped
snugly
about
their
susceptible
black
silk
shoulders
the
general
effect
was
that
of
an
old
people
home
i
found
seat
after
seat
at
table
was
filled
and
myself
the
youngest
thing
present
i
felt
so
criminally
young
that
i
wondered
they
did
not
strap
me
in
a
high
chair
and
ram
bread
and
milk
down
my
throat
now
and
then
the
door
would
open
to
admit
another
snuffly
ancient
and
member
of
the
company
i
learned
that
schwartz
on
my
right
did
not
care
mooch
for
shteak
for
breakfast
aber
a
leedle
she
likes
also
that
the
elderly
party
on
my
left
and
the
elderly
party
on
my
right
resented
being
separated
by
my
person
conversation
between
on
right
and
on
left
scintillated
across
my
soup
thus
how
you
feel
this
evening
mis
maurer
h
do
ask
no
wonder
you
got
rheumatism
my
room
was
like
a
all
day
yours
too
i
do
complain
any
more
much
good
it
does
barley
soup
again
in
my
own
home
i
never
ate
it
and
here
i
pay
my
good
money
and
get
four
time
a
week
barley
soup
are
those
fresh
cucumbers
they
stood
long
enough
look
at
mis
miller
she
feels
good
this
evening
she
should
feel
good
cents
she
won
at
bridge
i
never
seen
how
that
woman
is
got
i
choked
gasped
and
fled
back
in
my
own
mausoleum
once
more
i
put
things
in
order
dragged
my
typewriter
stand
into
the
least
murky
corner
under
the
bravest
gas
jet
and
rescued
my
tottering
reason
by
turning
out
a
long
letter
to
norah
that
finished
my
spirits
rose
i
dived
into
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
for
the
loose
sheets
of
the
glanced
over
the
last
three
or
four
discovered
that
they
did
not
sound
so
maudlin
as
i
had
feared
and
straightway
forgot
my
gloomy
surroundings
in
the
fascination
of
weaving
the
tale
in
the
midst
of
my
fine
frenzy
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
in
the
hall
stood
the
anemic
little
serving
maid
who
had
attended
me
at
dinner
she
was
almost
eclipsed
by
a
huge
green
pasteboard
box
you
mis
orme
ai
you
this
here
for
the
little
maid
hovered
at
the
threshold
while
i
lifted
the
box
cover
and
revealed
the
perfection
of
the
american
beauty
buds
that
lay
there
all
dewy
and
fragrant
the
eyes
of
the
little
maid
were
wide
with
wonder
as
she
gazed
and
because
i
had
known
i
separated
two
stately
blossoms
from
the
glowing
cluster
and
held
them
out
to
her
for
me
she
gasped
and
brought
her
lips
down
to
them
gently
then
there
a
high
green
jar
downstairs
you
can
have
to
stick
your
flowers
in
you
ai
got
nothin
big
enough
in
here
except
your
water
pitcher
an
putting
these
grand
flowers
in
a
water
pitcher
why
be
like
wearing
a
silk
dress
over
a
flannel
petticoat
would
it
when
the
anemic
little
slavey
with
the
soul
had
fetched
the
green
jar
i
placed
the
shining
stems
in
it
with
gentle
fingers
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
i
found
a
card
that
read
for
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
a
room
with
red
roses
and
still
be
how
well
he
knew
and
how
truly
impossible
to
be
sad
when
red
roses
are
glowing
for
one
and
filling
the
air
with
their
fragrance
the
interruption
was
fatal
to
my
thoughts
were
a
chaos
of
red
roses
and
anemic
little
maids
with
glowing
eyes
and
thoughtful
young
doctors
with
a
marvelous
understanding
of
feminine
moods
so
i
turned
out
all
the
lights
undressed
by
moonlight
and
throwing
a
kimono
about
me
carried
my
jar
of
roses
to
the
window
and
sat
down
beside
them
so
that
their
exquisite
scent
caressed
me
the
moonlight
had
put
a
spell
of
white
magic
upon
the
lake
it
was
a
world
that
lay
below
my
window
summer
finger
on
lip
had
stolen
in
upon
the
heels
of
spring
dim
shadowy
figures
dotted
the
benches
of
the
park
across
the
way
just
beyond
lay
the
silver
lake
a
dazzling
bar
of
moonlight
on
its
breast
motors
rushed
along
the
roadway
with
a
roar
and
a
whir
and
were
gone
leaving
a
trail
of
laughter
behind
them
from
the
open
window
of
the
room
below
came
the
of
cards
on
the
polished
table
surface
and
the
low
buzz
of
occasional
conversation
as
the
players
held
postmortems
under
the
street
light
the
popcorn
vender
cart
made
a
blot
on
the
mystic
beauty
of
the
scene
below
but
the
perfume
of
my
red
roses
came
to
me
and
their
velvet
caressed
my
check
and
beyond
the
noise
and
lights
of
the
street
lay
that
glorious
lake
with
the
bar
of
moonlight
on
its
soft
breast
i
gazed
and
forgave
the
landlady
her
dining
room
forgave
the
elderly
parties
their
shawls
and
barley
soup
forgot
for
a
moment
my
weary
thoughts
of
peter
orme
forgot
everything
except
that
it
was
june
and
moonlight
and
good
to
be
alive
all
the
changes
and
events
of
that
strange
eventful
year
came
crowding
to
my
mind
as
i
crouched
there
at
the
window
four
new
friends
tried
and
true
i
conned
them
over
joyously
in
my
heart
what
a
strange
contrast
they
made
blackie
of
the
elastic
morals
and
the
still
more
elastic
heart
frau
nirlanger
of
the
smiling
lips
and
the
lilting
voice
and
the
tragic
eyes
she
who
had
stooped
from
a
great
height
to
pluck
the
flower
of
love
blooming
below
only
to
find
a
worthless
weed
sullying
her
hand
alma
pflugel
with
the
unquenchable
light
of
gratefulness
in
her
honest
face
von
gerhard
ready
to
act
as
buffer
between
myself
and
the
world
tender
as
a
woman
gravely
thoughtful
with
the
light
of
devotion
glowing
in
his
steady
eyes
here
richness
said
i
like
the
fat
boy
in
pickwick
papers
and
i
thanked
god
for
the
new
energy
which
had
sent
me
to
this
lovely
city
by
the
lake
i
thanked
him
that
i
had
not
been
content
to
remain
a
burden
to
max
and
norah
growing
sour
and
crabbed
with
the
years
those
years
of
work
and
buffeting
had
made
of
me
a
broader
finer
truer
type
of
womanhood
had
caused
me
to
forget
my
own
little
tragedy
in
contemplating
the
great
human
comedy
and
so
i
made
a
little
prayer
there
in
the
room
o
dear
lord
i
prayed
and
i
did
not
mean
that
it
should
sound
irreverent
o
dear
lord
do
bother
about
my
ambitions
just
let
me
remain
strong
and
well
enough
to
do
the
work
that
is
my
portion
from
day
to
day
keep
me
faithful
to
my
standards
of
right
and
wrong
let
this
new
and
wonderful
love
which
has
come
into
my
life
be
a
staff
of
strength
and
comfort
instead
of
a
burden
of
weariness
let
me
not
grow
careless
and
slangy
as
the
years
go
by
let
me
keep
my
hair
and
complexion
and
teeth
and
deliver
me
from
wearing
soiled
blouses
and
doing
my
hair
in
a
knob
i
felt
quite
cheerful
after
that
so
cheerful
that
the
strange
bumps
in
the
new
bed
did
not
bother
me
as
unfamiliar
beds
usually
did
the
roses
i
put
to
sleep
in
their
jar
of
green
keeping
one
to
hold
against
my
cheek
as
i
slipped
into
dreamland
i
thought
drowsily
just
before
sleep
claimed
me
after
office
hours
i
tuck
up
my
skirt
and
wrap
my
head
in
a
towel
and
have
a
housecleaning
bee
i
move
the
bed
where
the
is
now
and
i
make
the
chiffonnier
swap
places
with
the
couch
one
feels
on
friendlier
terms
with
furniture
that
one
has
shoved
about
a
little
how
brilliant
the
moonlight
is
the
room
is
flooded
with
it
those
roses
sweet
sweet
when
i
awoke
it
was
morning
during
the
days
that
followed
i
looked
back
gratefully
upon
that
night
with
its
moonlight
and
its
roses
and
its
great
peace
chapter
xvii
the
shadow
of
terror
two
days
before
the
date
set
for
von
gerhard
departure
the
book
was
finished
typed
packed
and
sent
away
half
an
hour
after
it
was
gone
all
its
most
glaring
faults
seemed
to
marshall
themselves
before
my
mind
eye
whole
paragraphs
that
had
read
quite
reasonably
before
now
loomed
ludicrous
in
perspective
i
longed
to
snatch
it
back
to
tidy
it
here
to
take
it
in
there
to
smooth
certain
rough
places
neglected
in
my
haste
for
almost
a
year
i
had
lived
with
this
thing
so
close
that
its
faults
and
its
virtues
had
become
indistinguishable
to
me
day
and
night
for
many
months
it
had
been
in
my
mind
of
late
some
instinct
had
prompted
me
to
finish
it
i
had
worked
at
it
far
into
the
night
until
i
marveled
that
the
ancient
occupants
of
the
surrounding
rooms
did
not
enter
a
combined
protest
against
the
of
my
typewriter
keys
and
now
that
it
was
gone
i
wondered
dully
if
i
could
feel
von
gerhard
departure
more
keenly
no
one
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
book
except
norah
von
gerhard
blackie
and
me
blackie
had
a
way
of
inquiring
after
its
progress
in
hushed
tones
of
mock
awe
also
he
delighted
in
getting
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
guiding
a
carefully
about
my
desk
with
a
view
to
having
a
fence
built
around
it
bearing
an
inscription
which
would
inform
admiring
tourists
that
here
was
the
desk
at
which
the
brilliant
author
had
been
wont
to
sit
when
grinding
out
stories
for
the
humble
post
he
took
an
impish
delight
in
my
struggles
with
my
hero
and
heroine
and
his
inquiries
after
the
health
of
both
were
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
any
earnest
writer
person
rise
in
wrath
and
slay
him
i
had
seen
little
of
blackie
of
late
my
spare
hours
had
been
devoted
to
the
work
in
hand
on
the
day
after
the
book
was
sent
away
i
was
conscious
of
a
little
shock
as
i
strolled
into
blackie
sanctum
and
took
my
accustomed
seat
beside
his
big
desk
there
was
an
oddly
pinched
look
about
blackie
nostrils
and
lips
i
thought
and
the
black
eyes
appeared
deeper
and
blacker
than
ever
in
his
thin
little
face
a
week
of
unseasonable
weather
had
come
upon
the
city
june
was
going
out
in
a
wave
of
torrid
heat
such
as
august
might
have
boasted
the
day
had
seemed
endless
and
intolerably
close
i
was
feeling
very
limp
and
languid
perhaps
thought
i
it
was
the
heat
which
had
wilted
debonair
spirits
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
we
had
a
blackie
missed
you
also
you
look
just
a
wee
bit
green
around
the
edges
thinking
a
vacation
would
hurt
blackie
lean
brown
forefinger
caressed
the
bowl
of
his
favorite
pipe
his
eyes
that
had
been
gazing
out
across
the
roofs
beyond
his
window
came
back
to
me
and
there
was
in
them
a
curious
and
quizzical
expression
as
of
one
who
is
inwardly
amused
i
been
thinkin
about
a
vacation
none
of
your
measly
little
two
weeks
affairs
with
one
week
on
salary
and
th
other
without
i
goin
t
take
my
vacation
for
a
while
not
till
fall
or
maybe
winter
but
i
do
take
it
girl
it
goin
t
be
a
real
but
why
wait
so
long
i
asked
you
need
it
now
who
ever
heard
of
putting
off
a
vacation
until
winter
well
i
dunno
mused
blackie
i
just
made
my
arrangements
for
that
time
and
i
hate
t
muss
up
you
say
the
time
comes
that
my
plans
are
there
was
a
sharp
ring
from
the
telephone
at
blackie
elbow
he
answered
it
then
thrust
the
receiver
into
my
hand
for
you
he
said
it
was
von
gerhard
voice
that
came
to
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
said
something
most
important
if
i
call
for
you
at
six
we
can
drive
out
to
the
bay
for
supper
yes
i
must
talk
to
you
have
saved
my
life
i
called
back
it
has
been
a
beast
of
a
day
you
may
talk
as
much
and
as
importantly
as
you
like
so
long
as
i
am
kept
that
was
von
gerhard
said
i
to
blackie
and
tried
not
to
look
uncomfortable
mm
grunted
blackie
pulling
at
his
pipe
thoughtful
ai
he
i
turned
at
the
door
he
he
going
away
day
after
blackie
i
explained
although
no
explanation
had
been
asked
for
to
vienna
he
expects
to
stay
a
year
or
two
or
three
blackie
looked
up
quickly
goin
away
is
he
well
maybe
it
best
all
around
girl
i
see
his
name
been
mentioned
in
all
the
medical
papers
and
the
big
magazines
and
all
that
lately
gettin
t
be
a
big
bug
von
gerhard
is
sorry
he
goin
though
i
was
plannin
t
consult
him
just
before
i
go
on
my
vacation
but
some
other
guy
do
he
approve
of
me
von
gerhard
for
some
reason
which
i
could
never
explain
i
went
back
into
the
room
and
held
out
both
my
hands
to
blackie
his
nervous
brown
fingers
closed
over
them
that
does
make
one
bit
of
difference
to
us
does
it
blackie
i
said
gravely
we
we
not
caring
so
long
as
we
approve
of
one
another
are
we
not
a
bit
girl
smiled
blackie
not
a
when
the
green
car
stopped
before
the
old
folks
home
i
was
in
seraphic
mood
i
had
bathed
donned
clean
linen
and
a
gown
the
result
was
most
my
spirits
rose
unaccountably
even
the
sight
of
von
gerhard
looking
troubled
and
distrait
did
not
quiet
them
we
darted
away
out
along
the
lake
front
past
the
toll
gate
to
the
bay
road
stretching
its
flawless
length
along
the
water
side
it
was
alive
with
motor
cars
swarming
like
pilgrims
toward
the
mecca
of
cool
breezes
and
comfort
there
were
proud
limousines
comfortable
family
cars
trim
little
roadsters
noisy
runabouts
not
a
was
to
be
heard
it
was
as
though
the
horseless
age
had
indeed
descended
upon
the
world
there
was
only
a
hum
a
rush
a
roar
as
car
after
car
swept
on
summer
homes
nestled
among
the
trees
near
the
lake
through
the
branches
one
caught
occasional
gleams
of
silvery
water
the
rush
of
cool
air
fanned
my
hot
forehead
tousled
my
hair
slid
down
between
my
collar
and
the
back
of
my
neck
and
i
was
grandly
content
even
though
you
are
going
to
sail
away
and
even
though
you
have
the
grumps
and
refuse
to
talk
and
scowl
like
a
jabberwock
this
is
an
extremely
nice
world
you
ca
spoil
behute
von
gerhard
tone
was
solemn
would
you
be
faintly
interested
in
knowing
that
the
book
is
finished
so
that
is
well
you
were
wearing
yourself
thin
over
it
it
was
then
quickly
perfected
i
groaned
i
turn
cold
when
i
think
of
it
the
last
chapters
got
away
from
me
completely
they
lacked
the
von
gerhard
considered
that
a
moment
as
i
wickedly
had
intended
that
he
should
then
the
punch
what
is
that
then
the
punch
obligingly
i
elucidated
a
book
may
be
written
in
flawless
style
with
a
plot
and
a
climax
and
a
lot
of
little
side
surprises
but
if
it
lacks
that
peculiar
and
convincing
quality
poetically
known
as
the
punch
it
might
as
well
never
have
been
written
it
can
never
be
a
neither
will
it
live
as
a
classic
you
will
never
see
it
advertised
on
the
book
review
page
of
the
saturday
papers
nor
will
the
man
across
the
aisle
in
the
street
car
be
so
absorbed
in
its
contents
that
he
will
be
taken
past
his
von
gerhard
looked
troubled
but
the
literary
value
does
that
not
enter
i
do
aim
to
contribute
to
the
literary
uplift
i
assured
him
all
my
life
i
have
cherished
two
ambitions
one
of
them
is
to
write
a
successful
book
and
the
other
to
learn
to
whistle
through
my
teeth
this
way
you
know
as
the
gallery
gods
do
it
i
am
almost
despairing
of
the
whistle
but
i
still
have
hopes
of
the
whereupon
von
gerhard
after
a
moment
stiff
surprise
gave
vent
to
one
of
his
heartwarming
roars
thanks
said
i
now
tell
me
the
important
his
face
grew
serious
in
an
instant
not
yet
dawn
later
let
us
hear
more
about
the
book
not
so
flippant
however
small
one
the
time
is
past
when
you
can
deceive
me
with
your
surely
you
would
not
have
me
take
myself
seriously
that
another
debt
i
owe
my
irish
forefathers
they
could
laugh
bless
in
the
very
teeth
of
a
potato
crop
failure
and
let
me
tell
you
that
takes
some
sense
of
humor
the
book
is
my
potato
crop
if
it
fails
it
will
mean
that
i
must
keep
on
drudging
with
a
knot
or
two
taken
in
my
belt
but
i
squeeze
a
smile
out
of
the
corner
of
my
mouth
somehow
and
if
it
succeeds
oh
ernst
if
it
succeeds
then
kindchen
then
it
means
that
i
may
have
a
little
thin
layer
of
jam
on
my
bread
and
butter
it
wo
mean
money
at
least
i
do
think
it
will
a
first
book
never
does
but
it
will
mean
a
future
it
will
mean
that
i
will
have
something
solid
to
stand
on
it
will
be
a
real
beginning
a
breathing
spell
time
in
which
to
accomplish
something
really
worth
while
independence
freedom
from
this
stop
cried
von
gerhard
sharply
then
as
i
stared
in
surprise
i
do
ask
your
pardon
i
was
again
rude
nicht
wahr
but
in
me
there
is
a
queer
vein
of
german
superstition
that
disapproves
of
air
castles
sich
einbilden
we
call
the
lights
of
the
bay
pavilion
twinkled
just
ahead
the
green
car
poked
its
nose
up
the
path
between
rows
of
empty
machines
at
last
it
drew
up
panting
before
a
vacant
space
between
an
imposing
scarlet
touring
car
and
a
smart
runabout
we
left
it
there
and
walked
up
the
path
inside
the
great
structure
that
did
duty
as
pavilion
glasses
clinked
chairs
scraped
on
the
wooden
floor
a
burst
of
music
followed
a
sharp
fusillade
of
applause
through
the
open
doorway
could
be
seen
a
company
of
tyrolese
singers
in
picturesque
costumes
of
scarlet
and
green
and
black
the
scene
was
very
noisy
and
very
bright
and
very
german
not
in
there
eh
said
von
gerhard
as
though
divining
my
wish
it
is
too
brightly
lighted
and
too
noisy
we
will
find
a
table
out
here
under
the
trees
where
the
music
is
softened
by
the
distance
and
our
eyes
are
not
offended
by
the
ugliness
of
the
singers
but
inexcusably
ugly
they
are
these
tyrolese
we
found
a
table
within
the
glow
of
the
pavilion
lights
but
still
so
near
the
lake
that
we
could
hear
the
water
lapping
the
shore
a
cadaverous
waiter
brought
things
to
eat
and
we
made
brave
efforts
to
appear
hungry
and
hearty
but
my
high
spirits
were
ebbing
fast
and
von
gerhard
was
frankly
distraught
one
of
the
women
singers
appeared
suddenly
in
the
doorway
of
the
pavilion
then
stole
down
the
steps
and
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
beyond
our
table
the
voices
of
the
singers
ceased
abruptly
there
was
a
moment
hushed
silence
then
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
came
a
woman
voice
clear
strong
flexible
flooding
the
night
with
the
trill
of
the
mountain
yodel
the
sound
rose
and
fell
and
swelled
and
soared
a
silence
then
in
a
great
burst
of
melody
the
chorus
of
voices
within
the
pavilion
answered
the
call
again
a
silence
again
the
wonder
of
the
woman
voice
flooded
the
stillness
ending
in
a
note
higher
clearer
sweeter
than
any
that
had
gone
before
then
the
little
tyrolese
her
moment
of
glory
ended
sped
into
the
light
of
the
noisy
pavilion
again
when
i
turned
to
von
gerhard
my
eyes
were
wet
i
shall
have
that
to
remember
when
you
are
von
gerhard
beckoned
the
hovering
waiter
take
these
things
away
and
you
need
not
he
placed
something
in
the
man
palm
something
that
caused
a
sudden
whisking
away
of
empty
dishes
and
many
obsequious
bows
von
gerhard
face
was
turned
away
from
me
toward
the
beauty
of
the
lake
and
sky
now
as
the
last
flirt
of
the
waiter
apron
vanished
around
the
corner
he
turned
his
head
slowly
and
i
saw
that
in
his
eyes
which
made
me
catch
my
breath
with
apprehension
what
is
it
i
cried
norah
max
the
children
he
shook
his
head
they
are
well
so
far
as
i
know
i
perhaps
first
i
should
tell
you
although
this
is
not
the
thing
which
i
have
to
say
to
you
yes
i
urged
him
on
impatiently
i
had
never
seen
him
like
this
i
do
not
sail
this
week
i
shall
not
be
with
gluck
in
vienna
this
year
i
shall
stay
here
why
surely
because
i
shall
be
needed
here
dawn
because
i
can
not
leave
you
now
you
will
need
some
one
a
friend
i
stared
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
wide
with
terror
waiting
for
i
knew
not
what
need
some
one
for
what
i
stammered
why
should
you
in
the
kindly
shadow
of
the
trees
von
gerhard
hands
took
my
icy
ones
and
held
them
in
a
close
clasp
of
encouragement
norah
is
coming
to
be
with
you
norah
why
tell
me
at
once
at
once
because
peter
orme
has
been
sent
home
cured
said
he
the
lights
of
the
pavilion
fell
away
and
advanced
and
swung
about
in
a
great
sickening
circle
i
shut
my
eyes
the
lights
still
swung
before
my
eyes
von
gerhard
leaned
toward
me
with
a
word
of
alarm
i
clung
to
his
hands
with
all
my
strength
no
i
said
and
the
savage
voice
was
not
my
own
no
no
no
it
is
true
it
is
oh
it
some
joke
is
it
tell
me
it
something
funny
is
it
and
after
a
bit
we
laugh
we
laugh
of
course
see
i
am
smiling
already
dawn
dear
one
it
is
true
god
knows
i
wish
that
i
could
be
happy
to
know
it
the
hospital
authorities
pronounce
him
cured
he
has
been
quite
sane
for
you
knew
it
how
long
you
know
that
max
has
attended
to
all
communications
from
the
doctors
there
a
few
weeks
ago
they
wrote
that
orme
had
shown
evidences
of
recovery
he
spoke
of
you
of
the
people
he
had
known
in
new
york
of
his
work
on
the
paper
all
quite
rationally
and
calmly
but
they
must
first
be
sure
max
went
to
new
york
a
week
ago
peter
was
gone
the
hospital
authorities
were
frightened
and
apologetic
peter
had
walked
away
quite
coolly
one
day
he
had
gone
into
the
city
borrowed
money
of
some
old
newspaper
cronies
and
vanished
he
may
be
there
still
he
may
be
here
ernst
take
me
home
o
god
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
i
ought
to
be
happy
but
i
not
i
ought
to
be
thankful
but
i
not
i
not
the
horror
of
having
him
there
was
great
enough
but
it
was
nothing
compared
to
the
horror
of
having
him
here
i
used
to
dream
that
he
was
well
again
and
that
he
was
searching
for
me
and
the
dreadful
realness
of
it
used
to
waken
me
and
i
would
find
myself
shivering
with
terror
once
i
dreamed
that
i
looked
up
from
my
desk
to
find
him
standing
in
the
doorway
smiling
that
mirthless
smile
of
his
and
i
heard
him
say
in
his
mocking
way
dawn
my
love
looking
wonderfully
well
grass
widowhood
agrees
with
you
eh
dawn
you
must
not
laugh
like
that
come
we
will
go
you
are
shivering
do
dear
do
see
you
have
norah
and
max
and
me
to
help
you
we
will
put
him
on
his
feet
physically
he
is
not
what
he
should
be
i
can
do
much
for
you
i
cried
and
the
humor
of
it
was
too
exquisite
for
laughter
for
that
i
gave
up
vienna
said
von
gerhard
simply
you
too
must
do
your
my
share
i
have
done
my
share
he
was
in
the
gutter
and
he
was
dragging
me
with
him
when
his
insanity
came
upon
him
i
thanked
god
for
it
and
struggled
up
again
even
norah
never
knew
what
that
struggle
was
whatever
i
am
i
am
in
spite
of
him
i
tell
you
i
could
hug
my
widow
weeds
ten
years
ago
he
showed
me
how
horrible
and
unclean
a
thing
can
be
made
of
this
beautiful
life
i
was
a
despairing
cowering
girl
of
twenty
then
i
am
a
woman
now
happy
in
her
work
her
friends
growing
broader
and
saner
in
thought
quicker
to
appreciate
the
finer
things
in
life
and
now
what
they
were
dashing
off
a
rollicking
indoors
when
it
was
finished
there
came
a
burst
of
laughter
and
the
sharp
spat
of
applauding
hands
and
shouts
of
approbation
the
sounds
seemed
seared
upon
my
brain
i
rose
and
ran
down
the
path
toward
the
waiting
machine
there
in
the
darkness
i
buried
my
shamed
face
in
my
hands
and
prayed
for
the
tears
that
would
not
come
it
seemed
hours
before
i
heard
von
gerhard
firm
quick
tread
upon
the
gravel
path
he
moved
about
the
machine
adjusting
this
and
that
then
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
without
a
word
we
glided
out
upon
the
smooth
white
road
all
the
loveliness
of
the
night
seemed
to
have
vanished
only
the
ugly
distorted
shadows
remained
the
terror
of
uncertainty
gripped
me
i
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
von
stern
set
face
i
grasped
his
arm
suddenly
so
that
the
machine
veered
and
darted
across
the
road
with
a
mighty
wrench
von
gerhard
righted
it
he
stopped
the
machine
at
the
careful
kindchen
he
said
gravely
ernst
i
said
and
my
breath
came
quickly
chokingly
as
though
i
had
been
running
fast
ernst
i
ca
do
it
i
not
big
enough
i
ca
i
hate
him
i
tell
you

made
it
what
it
is
in
the
face
of

hundred
temptations
in
spite
of
a
hundred
pitfalls
i

lay

down

a
man
figure
rose
from
the
shadows
of
the
porch
and
came
forward
to
meet
us
as
we
swung
up
to
the
curbing
i
stifled
a
scream
in
my
throat
as
i
shrank
back
into
the
seat
i
heard
the
quick
intake
of
von
breath
as
he
leaned
forward
to
peer
into
the
darkness
a
sick
dread
came
upon
me
girl
drawled
the
man
voice
with
a
familiar
little
cackling
laugh
in
it

for

suspicious
character

fiendish
inspirations

this
time

blackie
struck
a
match
and
held
it
for
an
instant
so
that
the
flare
of
it
illuminated
his
face
as
he
lighted
his
cigarette
there
was
no
laughter
in
the
black
eyes
what
is
it
blackie
i
asked
again
the
horror
of
what

welcome
relief

led
the
way
indoors

bare
unfriendly
parlor
was
unoccupied
and
one
dim
gas
jet
did
duty
as
illumination

in
the
set
pieces
muttered
blackie
as
he
turned
two
more
gas
jets
flaring
high

yells
for
a
von

was
frowning

shortly
blackie
strange
black
eyes
were
fastened
on
my
face
and
i
saw
an
expression
of
pity
in
their
depths
as
he
began
to
talk
i
was
up
at
the
press
club
dropped
in
for
a
minute
or
two
like
i
always

dining
room
an
there
was
the
bunch
an
just
as
i
come
in
they
give
a
roar
and
i
started
to
investigate
up
against
the
fireplace
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
the
other
hanging
careless
like
on
the
mantel
stood
a
man
stranger
t
me
he
was
talkin
kind
of
low
and
quick
bitin
off
his
words
like
a
englishman
an
the
boys
they
was
with
their
eyes
an
their
mouths
and
forgettin
t

thin
unearthly
chap
with
the
whitest

somethin
like

lighted
pipe
with
a
little
fine
ash
over

red
just
waitin
for
a
sudden
pull
t
make
it

i
moaned
and
buried
my
face
in

quick
hand
on
my
arm
but
i
shook
it
off
i
not

new
york
press

boer
war
and
the
an
gawd
knows
where
he
spoke
low
not
usin
any
big
words

an
i
thought
his
eyes
looked
somethin
like
those
of
the
black
cat
up
on
the
mantel
just
over
his
head
you
know
what
i
mean
when
the
electric
lights
is
turned
on
sic
the
ugly
thing
well
every
time
he
showed
signs
of
stoppin
one
of
the
boys
would
up
with
a
question
and
start
him
again
he
knew
everybody
an
everything
an
everywhere
all
of
a
sudden
one
of
the
boys
points
to
the
roosevelt
signature
on
the
wall
the
one
he
scrawled
up
there
along
with
all
the
other
celebrities
first
time
he
was
entertained
by
the
press
club
boys
well
this
guy
he
looked
at
the
name
for
a
minute
he
says
slow
yes
seems
t
me
i
heard
of
him
well
at
that
the
boys
yelled
thought
it
was
a
good
joke
seein
that
ted
had
been
smeared
all
over
the
first
page
of
everything
for
years
but
kid
i
seen
th
look
in
that
eyes
when
he
said
it
and
he
was
jokin
girl
an
it
came
t
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
all
the
things
he
been
talkin
about
had
happened
almost
ten
years
back
after
he
made
that
break
about
roosevelt
he
kind
of
shut
up
and
strolled
over
to
the
piano
and
began
t
play
you
know
that
bum
old
piano
with
half
a
dozen
dead
keys
and
no
tune
i
looked
up
for
a
moment
he
could
make
you
think
that
it
was
a
concert
grand
could
he
he
has
forgotten
even
that
forgotten
girl
i
do
know
what
his
accomplishments
was
when
you
knew
him
but
if
he
was
any
more
fascinatin
than
he
is
now
then
glad
i
did
know
him
he
could
charm
the
pay
envelope
away
from
a
reporter
that
was
saturday
broke
somethin
seemed
t
urge
me
t
go
up
t
him
an
say
a
game
of
billiards
care
if
i
do
says
he
and
swung
his
long
legs
off
the
piano
stool
and
we
made
for
the
billiard
room
with
the
whole
gang
after
us
girl
i
a
modest
violet
i
am
but
i
do
mind
that
the
general
opinion
up
at
the
club
is
that
i
a
little
wizard
with
the
cue
well
he
got
through
with
me
i
looked
like
little
sister
when
big
brother
is
tryin
t
teach
her
how
to
hold
the
cue
in
her
fingers
he
just
sent
them
balls
wherever
he
thought
they
look
pretty
i
bet
if
he
held
up
his
thumb
and
finger
an
said
through
this
them
balls
would
of
von
gerhard
took
a
couple
of
quick
steps
in
blackie
direction
his
eyes
were
blue
steel
is
this
then
necessary
he
asked
all
this
leads
to
what
has
not
orme
suffered
enough
that
she
should
undergo
this
idle
chatter
it
is
sufficient
that
she
knows
this
this
man
is
here
it
is
a
time
for
action
not
for
action
comin
later
doc
drawled
blackie
looking
impish
monologuin
ai
my
specialty
i
let
the
other
gink
talk
you
never
can
learn
nothin
by
talkin
but
i
got
somethin
t
say

now
in
case
you
bored
the
least
bit
do
hesitate
one
minnit
t
na
you
are
quite
right
and
i
was
hasty
said
von
gerhard
and
his
eyes
with
the
kindly
gleam
in
them
smiled
down
upon
the
little
man
it
is
only
that
both
you
and
i
are
to
be
of
assistance
to
this
unhappy
lady
well
we
shall
see
you
talked
with
this
man
at
the
press
club
he
talked
i
that
would
be
peter
way
i
said
bitterly
how
he
used
to
love
to
hold
forth
and
how
i
grew
to
long
for
blessed
silence
for
fewer
words
and
more
of
that
reserve
which
means
strength
all
this
time
continued
blackie
i
did
know
his
name
when
finished
our
game
of
billiards
he
hung
up
his
cue
and
then
he
turned
around
like
lightning
and
faced
the
boys
that
were
standing
around
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
he
had
a
odd
little
smile
on
his
face
a
smile
with
no
fun
it
if
you
know
what
i
mean
guess
you
do
maybe
if
you
seen
it
says
he
smilin
that
twisted
kind
of
smile
i
for
a
job
i
not
much
of
a
talker
an
i
only
a
amateur
at
music
and
my
game
of
billiards
is
ragged
but
there
one
thing

abc
up
to
xyz

that
case
can

let
me
have
ten
until
monday
blackie
came
over
to
me
as
i
sat
cowering
in
my
chair
he
patted
my
shoulder
with
one
lean
brown
hand
now
kid
you
dig
see
beat
it
go
home
for
a
week
i
fix
it
up
with
norberg

a
guy

t
do
send
your
down
here
if
you
want
to
make
it
a
family
affair
and
between
us
we
see
this
thing
i
looked
up
at
von
gerhard
he
was
nodding
approval
it
all
seemed
so
easy
so
temptingly
easy
to
run
away
not
to
face
him
until
i
was
safe
in
the
shelter
of
norah
arms
i
stood
up
resolve
lending
me
new
strength
and
courage
i
am
going
i
know
it
is
brave
but
i
ca
be
brave
any
longer
too
tired
too
old
i
grasped
the
hand
of
each
of
those
men
who
had
stood
by
me
so
staunchly
in
the
year
that
was
past
the
words
of
thanks
that
i
had
on
my
lips
ended
in
dry
helpless
sobs
and
because
blackie
and
von
gerhard
looked
so
pathetically
concerned
and
so
unhappy
in
my
unhappiness
my
sobs
changed
to
hysterical
laughter
in
which
the
two
men
joined
after
one
moment
bewildered
staring
so
it
was
that
we
did
not
hear
the
front
door
slam
or
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
hall
our
overstrained
nerves
found
relief
in
laughter
so
that
peter
orme
a
lean
ominous
figure
in
the
doorway
looked
in
upon
a
merry
scene
i
was
the
first
to
see
him
and
at
the
sight
of
the
emaciated
figure
with
its
hollow
cheeks
and
its
sunken
eyes
all
terror
and
hatred
left
me
and
i
felt
only
a
great
pity
for
this
wreck
of
manhood
slowly
i
went
up
to
him
there
in
the
doorway
well
peter
i
said
well
dawn
old
girl
said
he
you
looking
wonderfully
fit
grass
widowhood
seems
to
agree
with
you
eh
and
i
knew
then
that
my
dread
dream
had
come
true
peter
advanced
into
the
room
with
his
old
easy
grace
of
manner
his
eyes
glowed
as
he
looked
at
blackie
then
he
laughed
showing
his
even
white
teeth
why
you
little
liar
he
said
in
his
crisp
clear
english
i
a
notion
to
thwack
you
what
d
you
mean
by
telling
me
my
gone
you
not
sweet
on
her
yourself
eh
von
gerhard
stifled
an
exclamation
and
orme
turned
quickly
in
his
direction
who
are
you
he
asked
still
another
admirer
jolly
time
you
were
having
when
i
he
stared
at
von
gerhard
deliberately
and
coolly
a
little
frown
of
dislike
came
into
his
face
you
a
doctor
are
you
i
knew
it
i
can
tell
by
the
hands
and
the
eyes
and
the
skin
and
the
smell
lived
with
for
ten
years
damn
them
dawn
tell
these
fellows
they
excused
will
you
and
by
the
way
you
do
seem
very
happy
to
see
me
i
went
up
to
him
then
and
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
peter
you
understand
these
two
gentlemen
have
been
all
that
is
kind
to
me
i
am
happy
to
know
that
you
are
well
again
surely
you
do
not
expect
me
to
be
joyful
at
seeing
you
all
that
pretense
was
left
out
of
our
lives
long
before
your
illness
it
has
been
all
roses
for
me
since
then
peter
i
worked
until
i
wanted
to
die
with
weariness
you
know
what
this
newspaper
game
is
for
a
woman
it
does
grow
easier
as
she
grows
older
and
oh
cut
out
the
melodrama
dawn
sneered
peter
have
either
of
you
fellows
the
makin
about
you
thanks
i
famished
for
a
the
worrying
words
of
ten
years
ago
rose
automatically
to
my
lips
are
you
smoking
too
much
peter
the
tone
was
that
of
a
harassed
wife
peter
stared
then
he
laughed
his
short
mirthless
little
laugh
by
jove
dawn
i
believe
you
as
much
my
wife
now
as
you
were
ten
years
ago
i
always
said
you
know
that
you
would
have
become
a
nagger
if
you
had
had
such
a
keen
sense
of
humor
that
saved
he
turned
his
mocking
eyes
to
von
gerhard
does
it
beat
the
devil
how
these
good
women
stick
to
a
man
once
they
married
there
a
certain
devotion
about
it
that
there
was
a
dreadful
little
silence
for
the
first
time
in
my
knowledge
of
him
i
saw
a
hot
painful
red
dyeing
blackie
sallow
face
his
eyes
had
a
menace
in
their
depths
then
very
quietly
von
gerhard
stepped
forward
and
stopped
directly
before
me
dawn
he
said
very
softly
and
gently
i
retract
my
statement
of
an
hour
ago
if
you
will
give
me
another
chance
to
do
as
you
asked
me
i
shall
thank
god
for
it
all
my
life
there
is
no
degradation
in
that
to
live
with
this
man
that
is
degradation
and
i
say
you
shall
not
suffer
i
looked
up
into
his
face
and
it
had
never
seemed
so
dear
to
me
the
time
for
that
is
past
i
said
my
tone
as
calm
and
even
as
his
own
a
man
like
you
can
not
burden
himself
with
a
derelict
like
me
mast
gone
sails
gone
drifting
five
years
from
now
you
thank
me
for
what
i
am
saying
now
my
place
is
with
this
other
wreck
tossed
about
by
wind
and
weather
until
we
both
go
down
there
came
a
sharp
insistent
ring
at
the
no
answering
sound
came
from
the
regions
above
stairs
the
ringing
sounded
again
louder
than
before
i
be
the
buttons
said
blackie
and
disappeared
into
the
hallway
oh
yes
i
heard
about
you
came
to
our
ears
a
moment
later
in
a
high
clear
voice
a
dear
beloved
voice
that
sent
me
flying
to
the
door
in
an
agony
of
hope
norah
i
cried
norah
norah
norah
and
as
her
blessed
arms
closed
about
me
the
tears
that
had
been
denied
me
before
came
in
a
torrent
of
joy
there
there
murmured
she
patting
my
shoulder
with
those
comforting
what
all
this
about
and
why
did
somebody
meet
me
i
telegraphed
you
did
get
it
well
i
forgive
you
peter
i
suppose
you
are
peter
i
hope
you
have
been
acting
devilish
again
that
seems
to
be
your
specialty
now
do
smile
that
mephistophelian
smile
at
me
it
does
frighten
me
von
gerhard
take
him
down
to
his
hotel
i
dying
for
my
kimono
and
bed
and
this
child
is
trembling
like
a
now
run
along
all
of
you
things
that
look
at
night
always
turn
pink
in
the
morning
great
heavens
there
somebody
calling
down
from
the
landing
it
sounds
like
a
landlady
run
dawn
and
tell
her
your
perfectly
respectable
sister
has
come
peter
von
gerhard
blackie
shoo
chapter
xix
a
turn
of
the
wheel
you
who
were
ever
alert
to
befriend
a
man
you
who
were
ever
the
first
to
defend
a
man
you
who
had
always
the
money
to
lend
a
man
down
on
his
luck
and
hard
up
for
a
v
sure
you
be
playing
a
harp
in
beatitude
and
a
quare
sight
you
will
be
in
that
attitude
some
day
where
gratitude
seems
but
a
platitude
you
find
your
from
my
desk
i
could
see
peter
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
news
editor
room
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
moment
then
i
opened
them
again
quickly
no
it
was
not
a
dream
he
was
there
a
slender
graceful
hateful
figure
with
the
inevitable
cigarette
in
his
unsteady
fingers
the
cigarette
of
the
old
days
peter
was
peter
ten
years
had
made
little
difference
there
were
queer
little
hollow
places
in
his
cheeks
and
under
the
and
at
the
base
of
the
head
and
a
flabby
appearance
about
the
skin
that
was
all
that
made
him
different
from
the
peter
of
the
old
days
the
thing
had
adjusted
itself
as
norah
had
said
it
would
the
situation
that
had
filled
me
with
loathing
and
terror
the
night
of
peter
return
had
been
transformed
into
quite
a
and
commonplace
affair
under
norah
deft
management
and
now
i
was
back
in
harness
again
and
peter
was
turning
out
brilliant
political
stuff
at
spasmodic
intervals
he
was
not
capable
of
any
sustained
effort
he
never
would
be
again
that
was
plain
he
was
growing
restless
and
dissatisfied
he
spoke
of
new
york
as
though
it
were
valhalla
he
said
that
he
had
seen
a
pretty
girl
since
he
left
street
he
laughed
at
quaint
german
atmosphere
he
sneered
at
our
journalistic
methods
and
called
the
newspapers
country
sheets
and
was
forever
talking
of
the
world
and
the
herald
and
the
sun
until
the
men
at
the
press
club
fought
shy
of
him
norah
had
found
quiet
and
comfortable
quarters
for
peter
in
a
near
the
lake
and
just
a
square
or
two
distant
from
my
own
he
hated
it
cordially
as
only
the
can
hate
a
and
threatened
to
leave
daily
let
go
back
to
the
big
town
dawn
old
girl
he
would
say
buried
alive
in
this
overgrown
dutch
village
i
came
here
in
the
first
place
on
your
account
now
it
up
to
you
to
get
me
out
of
it
think
of
what
new
york
means
think
of
what
i
been
and
i
can
write
as
well
as
but
i
always
shook
my
head
we
would
not
last
a
month
in
new
york
peter
new
york
has
hurried
on
and
left
us
behind
we
just
two
pieces
of
discard
we
have
to
be
content
where
we
content
in
this
silly
hole
you
must
be
mad
then
with
one
of
his
unaccountable
changes
of
tone
and
topic
dawn
let
me
have
some
money
i
strapped
if
i
had
the
time
i
get
out
some
magazine
stuff
anything
to
get
a
little
extra
coin
tell
me
how
does
that
little
sport
you
call
blackie
happen
to
have
so
much
ready
cash
i
never
yet
struck
him
for
a
loan
that
he
has
obliged
me
i
think
he
sweet
on
you
perhaps
and
thinks
he
doing
you
a
sort
of
at
times
such
as
these
all
the
old
spirit
that
i
had
thought
dead
within
me
would
rise
up
in
revolt
against
this
creature
who
was
taking
from
me
my
pride
my
sense
of
honor
my
friends
i
never
saw
von
gerhard
now
peter
had
refused
outright
to
go
to
him
for
treatment
saying
that
he
was
going
to
be
poisoned
by
any
cursed
doctor
particularly
not
by
one
who
had
wanted
to
run
away
with
his
wife
before
his
very
eyes
sometimes
i
wondered
how
long
this
could
go
on
i
thought
of
the
old
days
with
the
nirlangers
of
alma
pflugel
cottage
of
bennie
of
the
knapfs
of
the
uncouth
aborigines
and
their
many
kindnesses
i
saw
these
dear
people
rarely
now
frau
nirlanger
resignation
to
her
unhappiness
only
made
me
rebel
more
keenly
against
my
own
if
only
peter
could
become
well
and
strong
again
i
told
myself
bitterly
if
it
were
not
for
those
blue
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
the
shrunken
muscles
and
the
withered
skin
i
could
leave
him
to
live
his
life
as
he
saw
fit
but
he
was
as
dependent
as
a
child
and
as
capricious
what
was
the
end
to
be
i
asked
myself
where
was
it
all
leading
me
and
then
in
a
fearful
and
wonderful
manner
my
question
was
answered
there
came
to
my
desk
one
day
an
envelope
bearing
the
of
the
publishing
house
to
which
i
had
sent
my
story
i
balanced
it
for
a
moment
in
my
fingers
wondering
hoping
surmising
of
course
they
ca
want
it
i
told
myself
in
preparation
for
any
disappointment
that
was
in
store
for
me
they
sending
it
back
this
is
the
letter
that
will
tell
me
and
then
i
opened
it
the
words
jumped
out
at
me
from
the
typewritten
page
i
crushed
the
paper
in
my
hands
and
rushed
into
blackie
little
office
as
i
had
been
used
to
doing
in
the
old
days
he
was
at
his
desk
pipe
in
mouth
i
shook
his
shoulder
and
flourished
the
letter
wildly
and
did
a
crazy
little
dance
about
his
chair
they
want
it
they
like
it
not
only
that
they
want
another
as
soon
as
i
can
get
it
out
think
of
it
blackie
removed
his
pipe
from
between
his
teeth
and
wiped
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
i
thinkin
he
said
anything
t
oblige
you
when
you
through
shovin
that
paper
into
my
face
would
you
mind
explainin
who
wants
what
oh
you
so
stupid
so
slow
ca
you
see
that
i
written
a
real
live
book
and
had
it
accepted
and
that
i
am

on

yacht
or

got
through
gettin
those
royalties
for
that
book

down
to
fresh
wall

new
gas
stove

do
want
to
but
i
hate
to
see
you
come
down
with
a
suddenly
he
sat
up
and
a
grin
overspread
his
thin
face
tell
you
what
we
do
girlie
we
celebrate
maybe
it
be
the
last
time

pretend
this
is
six
months
ago
and
everything
serene
you
get
your
bonnet
i
get
the
machine

too
hot
to
work
anyway
we
take
a
spin
out
to
somewhere
that
cool
and
we
order
cold
things
to
eat
and
cold
things
to
drink
and
you
can
talk
about
yourself
till
you
tired
you
have
to
take
it
out
on
somebody
an
it
might
as
well
be
five
minutes
later
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
i
turned
to
find
peter
at
my
elbow
want
to
talk
to
you
he
said
frowning
sorry
peter
but
i
ca
stop
wo
it
do
later
no
got
an
assignment
i
go
with
exactly
peter
the
truth
is
blackie
has
taken
pity
on
me
and
has
promised
to
take
me
out
for
a
spin
just
to
cool
off
it
has
been
so
insufferably
peter
turned
away
count
me
in
on
that
he
said
over
his
shoulder
but
i
ca
peter
i
cried
it
is
my
party
and
anyway
peter
turned
around
and
there
was
an
ugly
glow
in
his
eyes
and
an
ugly
look
on
his
face
and
a
little
red
ridge
that
i
had
not
noticed
before
seemed
to
burn
itself
across
his
forehead
and
anyway
you
do
want
me
eh
well
i
going
i
not
going
to
have
my
wife
chasing
all
over
the
country
with
strange
men
remember
you
not
the
giddy
grass
widdy
you
used
to
be
you
can
take
me
or
stay
at
home
understand
his
voice
was
and
quavering
something
in
his
manner
struck
a
vague
terror
to
my
heart
why
peter
if
you
care
that
much
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
go
so
will
blackie
i
am
sure
come
we
go
down
now
he
be
waiting
for
blackie
keen
clever
mind
grasped
the
situation
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
together
his
dark
face
was
illumined
by
one
of
his
rare
smiles
coming
with
us
orme
do
you
good
pile
into
the
tonneau
you
two
and
hang
on
to
your
hair
i
going
to
smash
the
peter
sauntered
up
to
the
let
me
drive
he
said
not
bad
at
nix
with
the
artless
amateur
returned
blackie
this
ai
no
demonstration
car
i
drive
my
own
little
wagon
when
i
go
riding
and
i
intend
to
until
i
take
my
last
ride
feet
peter
muttered
something
surly
and
climbed
into
the
front
seat
next
to
blackie
leaving
me
to
occupy
the
tonneau
in
solitary
state
peter
began
to
ask
questions
dozens
of
them
which
blackie
answered
patiently
and
fully
i
could
not
hear
all
that
they
said
but
i
saw
that
peter
was
urging
blackie
to
greater
speed
and
that
blackie
was
explaining
that
he
must
first
leave
the
crowded
streets
behind
suddenly
peter
made
a
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
wheel
and
said
something
in
a
high
sharp
voice
blackie
answer
was
quick
and
decidedly
in
the
negative
the
next
instant
peter
orme
rose
in
his
place
and
leaning
forward
and
upward
grasped
the
wheel
that
was
in
blackie
hands
the
car
swerved
sickeningly
i
noticed
dully
that
blackie
did
not
go
white
as
novelists
say
men
do
in
moments
of
horror
a
dull
red
flush
crept
to
the
very
base
of
his
neck
with
a
twist
of
his
frail
body
he
tried
to
throw
off
peter
hands
i
remember
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
trying
to
pull
peter
back
as
i
realized
that
it
was
a
madman
with
whom
we
were
dealing
nothing
seemed
real
it
was
ridiculously
like
the
things
one
sees
in
the
moving
picture
theaters
i
felt
no
fear
sit
down
orme
blackie
yelled
you
ditch
us
dawn
god
we
shot
down
a
little
hill
two
wheels
were
lifted
from
the
ground
the
machine
was
poised
in
the
air
for
a
second
before
it
crashed
into
the
ditch
and
turned
over
completely
throwing
me
clear
but
burying
blackie
and
peter
under
its
weight
of
steel
and
wood
and
whirring
wheels
i
remember
rising
from
the
ground
and
sinking
back
again
and
rising
once
more
to
run
forward
to
where
the
car
lay
in
the
ditch
and
tugging
at
that
great
frame
of
steel
with
crazy
futile
fingers
then
i
ran
screaming
down
the
road
toward
a
man
who
was
tranquilly
working
in
a
field
nearby
chapter
xx
blackie
vacation
comes
the
shabby
blue
office
coat
hangs
on
the
hook
in
the
little
sporting
room
where
blackie
placed
it
no
one
dreams
of
moving
it
there
it
dangles
out
at
elbows
disreputable
its
pockets
burned
from
many
a
hot
pipe
thrust
carelessly
into
them
its
cuffs
frayed
its
lapels
bearing
the
marks
of
cigarette
and
pen
it
is
that
faded
old
garment
more
than
anything
else
which
makes
us
fail
to
realize
that
its
owner
will
never
again
slip
into
its
comfortable
folds
we
can
not
believe
that
a
lifeless
rag
like
that
can
triumph
over
the
man
of
flesh
and
blood
and
nerves
and
sympathies
with
what
contempt
do
we
look
upon
those
garments
during
our
lifetime
and
how
they
live
on
defying
time
long
long
after
we
have
been
gathered
to
our
last
rest
in
some
miraculous
manner
blackie
had
lived
on
for
two
days
after
that
ghastly
ride
peter
had
been
killed
instantly
the
doctors
said
they
gave
no
hope
for
blackie
my
escape
with
but
a
few
ridiculous
bruises
and
scratches
was
due
they
said
to
the
fact
that
i
had
sat
in
the
tonneau
i
heard
them
all
in
a
stupor
of
horror
and
grief
and
wondered
what
plan
fate
had
in
store
for
me
that
i
alone
should
have
been
spared
norah
and
max
came
and
took
things
in
charge
and
i
saw
von
gerhard
but
all
three
appeared
dim
and
shadowy
like
figures
in
a
mist
when
i
closed
my
eyes
i
could
see
peter
tense
figure
bending
over
blackie
at
the
wheel
and
heard
his
labored
breathing
as
he
struggled
in
his
mad
fury
and
felt
again
the
helpless
horror
that
had
come
to
me
as
we
swerved
off
the
road
and
into
the
ditch
below
with
blackie
rigid
and
desperate
still
clinging
to
the
wheel
i
lived
it
all
over
and
over
in
my
mind
in
the
midst
of
the
blackness
i
heard
a
sentence
that
cleared
the
fog
from
my
mind
and
caused
me
to
raise
myself
from
my
pillows
some
one
norah
i
think
had
said
that
blackie
was
conscious
and
that
he
was
asking
for
some
of
the
men
at
the
office
and
for
me
for
me
i
rose
and
dressed
in
spite
of
norah
protests
i
was
quite
well
i
told
them
i
must
see
him
i
shook
them
off
with
trembling
fingers
and
when
they
saw
that
i
was
quite
determined
they
gave
in
and
von
gerhard
telephoned
to
the
hospital
to
learn
the
hour
at
which
i
might
meet
the
others
who
were
to
see
blackie
for
a
brief
moment
i
met
them
in
the
stiff
little
waiting
room
of
he
hospital
norberg
deming
schmidt
holt
men
who
had
known
him
from
the
time
when
they
had
yelled
heh
boy
at
him
when
they
wanted
their
pencils
sharpened
awkwardly
we
followed
the
nurse
who
glided
ahead
of
us
down
the
wide
hospital
corridors
past
doorways
through
which
we
caught
glimpses
of
white
beds
that
were
no
whiter
than
the
faces
that
lay
on
the
pillows
we
came
at
last
into
a
very
still
and
bright
little
room
where
blackie
lay
had
years
passed
over
his
head
since
i
saw
him
last
the
face
that
tried
to
smile
at
us
from
the
pillow
was
strangely
wizened
and
old
it
was
as
though
a
withering
blight
had
touched
it
only
the
eyes
were
the
same
they
glowed
in
the
sunken
face
beneath
the
shock
of
black
hair
with
a
startling
luster
and
brilliancy
i
do
not
know
what
pain
he
suffered
i
do
not
know
what
magic
medicine
gave
him
the
strength
to
smile
at
us
dying
as
he
was
even
then
well
what
do
you
know
about
little
paul
dombey
he
piped
in
a
high
thin
voice
the
shock
of
relief
was
too
much
we
giggled
hysterically
then
stopped
short
and
looked
at
each
other
like
scared
and
naughty
children
boys
and
girls
cut
out
the
heavy
thinking
parts
do
make
me
do
all
the
social
stunts
what
the
news
what
kind
of
a
rotten
cotton
sportin
sheet
is
that
dub
callahan
gettin
out
who
won
cubs
or
pirates
norberg
you
goat
who
pinned
that
purple
tie
on
you
he
was
so
like
the
blackie
we
had
always
known
that
we
were
at
our
ease
immediately
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
window
and
some
one
laughed
a
little
laugh
somewhere
down
the
corridor
and
deming
who
is
irish
plunged
into
a
droll
description
of
a
office
boy
who
had
arrived
that
day
me
black
the
kid
wears
spectacles
and
a
norfolk
suit
and
shoes
with
bows
on
on
the
square
he
does
looks
like
one
of
those
boston
infants
you
see
in
the
comic
papers
i
do
believe
real
we
saving
him
until
you
get
back
if
the
kids
in
the
alley
do
chew
him
up
before
that
an
almost
imperceptible
shade
passed
over
blackie
face
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
without
their
light
his
countenance
was
ashen
and
awful
a
nurse
in
stripes
and
cap
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
looked
keenly
at
the
little
figure
in
the
bed
then
she
turned
to
us
you
must
go
now
she
said
you
were
just
to
see
him
for
a
minute
or
two
you
blackie
summoned
the
wan
ghost
of
a
smile
to
his
lips
guess
you
guys
ai
got
th
stimulatin
effect
that
a
bunch
of
live
wires
ought
to
have
say
norberg
tell
that
fathead
callahan
if

office
kids

all
the
roller
rink
passes
surest
thing
you
i
tell
him
black
stammered
norberg
and
turned
away
they
said
awkwardly
enough
not
one
of
them
that
did
not
owe
him
an
unpayable
debt
of
gratitude
not
one
that
had
not
the
memory
of
some
secret
kindness
stored
away
in
his
heart
it
was
blackie
who
had
furnished
the
money
that
had
sent
deming
sick
wife
west
it
had
been
blackie
who
had
rescued
schmidt
time
and
again
when
drink
got
a
blackie
had
always
said
fire
schmidt
not
much
why
schmidt
writes
better
stuff
drunk
than
all
the
rest
of
the
bunch
and
schmidt
would
be
granted
another
reprieve
by
the
powers
that
were
suddenly
blackie
beckoned
the
nurse
in
the
doorway
she
came
swiftly
and
bent
over
him
gim
me
two
minutes
more
that
a
good
nursie
there
something
i
want
to
say
t
this
dame
it

doubtfully
but

t
be
no

from
east
lynne
be
a
good
kid
the
rest
of
the
bunch
can
and
so
when
the
others
had
gone
i
found
myself
seated
at
the
side
of
his
bed
trying
to
smile
down
at
him
i
knew
that
there
must
be
nothing
to
excite
him
but
the
words
on
my
lips
would
come
blackie
i
said
and
i
struggled
to
keep
my
voice
calm
and
emotionless
blackie
forgive
me
it
is
all
my
fault
my
wretched
now
cut
that
interrupted
blackie
i
thought
that
was
your
game
that
why
i
said
i
wanted
t
talk
t
you
now

tellin

kid
ai

shame
that

to
go
out
in
a
auto
smashup
in
these
days
when
even
a
airship
exit
do
make
a
splash
on
the
front
page
the
nervous
brown
hand
was
moving
restlessly
over
the
covers
finally
it
met
my
hand
and
held
it
in
a
tense
little
grip
we
been
good
pals

ai
we
kid

he
gave
a
little
contented
sigh
at
that
and
his
eyes
closed
when
he
opened
them
the
old
whimsical
smile
wrinkled
his
face
this
is
where
i
get
off
at
it
ai
been
no
long
trip
but
girl
i
enjoyed
every
mile
of
the
road

kinds
of
plain
fancy
uphill
downhill
i
leaned
forward
fearfully
not

whispered
blackie

in
the

they
always
are
strong
on
the
kiss
what
and
as
the
nurse
appeared
in
the
doorway
again
disapproval
on
her
face
i
stooped
and
gently
pressed
my
lips
to
the
cheek
chapter

happiness
we
laid
peter
to
rest
in
that
noisy
careless
busy
city
that
he
had
loved
so
well
and
i
think
his
cynical
lips
would
have
curled
in
a
bitterly
amused
smile
and
his
somber
eyes
would
have
flamed
into
sudden
wrath
if
he
could
have
seen
how
utterly
and
completely
new
york
had
forgotten
peter
orme
he
had
been
buried
alive
ten
years
before
and
newspaper
row
has
no
faith
in
resurrections
peter
orme
was
not
even
a
memory
ten
years
is
an
age
in
a
city
where
epochs
are
counted
by
hours
now
after
two
weeks
of
norah
loving
care
i
was
back
in
the
pretty
little
city
by
the
lake
i
had
come
to
say
farewell
to
all
those
who
had
filled
my
life
so
completely
in
that
year
my
days
of
newspaper
work
were
over
the
autumn
and
winter
would
be
spent
at
norah
occupied
with
hours
of
delightful
congenial
work
for
the
second
book
was
to
be
written
in
the
quiet
peace
of
my
own
little
michigan
town
von
gerhard
was
to
take
his
deferred
trip
to
vienna
in
the
spring
and
i
knew
that
i
was
to
go
with
him
the
thought
filled
my
heart
with
a
great
flood
of
happiness
together
von
gerhard
and
i
had
visited
alma
pflugel
cottage
and
the
garden
was
blooming
in
all
its
wonder
of
color
and
scent
as
we
opened
the
little
gate
and
walked
up
the
worn
path
we
found
them
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
arbor
the
two
women
sewing
bennie
playing
with
the
last
wonderful
toy
that
blackie
had
given
him
they
made
a
serene
and
beautiful
picture
there
against
the
green
canopy
of
the
leaves
we
spoke
of
frau
nirlanger
and
of
blackie
and
of
the
strange
snarl
of
events
which
had
at
last
been
unwound
to
knit
a
close
friendship
between
us
and
when
i
had
kissed
them
and
walked
for
the
last
time
in
many
months
up
the
path
the
scarlet
and
pink
and
green
and
gold
of
that
wonderful
garden
swam
in
a
mist
before
my
eyes
frau
nirlanger
was
next
when
we
spoke
of
vienna
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
vienna
she
repeated
and
the
longing
in
her
voice
was
an
actual
pain
vienna
gott
shall
i
ever
see
it
again
vienna
my
boy
is
there
perhaps
perhaps
i
said
gently
stranger
things
have
happened
perhaps
if
i
could
see
them
and
talk
to
them
if
i
could
tell
them
they
might
be
made
to
understand
i
have
been
a
newspaper
reporter
all
these
years
without
acquiring
a
golden
gift
of
persuasiveness
perhaps
who
knows
we
may
meet
again
in
vienna
stranger
things
have
frau
nirlanger
shook
her
head
with
a
little
hopeless
sigh
you
do
not
know
vienna
you
do
not
know
the
iron
strength
of
caste
and
custom
and
pride
i
am
dead
in
vienna
and
the
dead
should
rest
in
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
von
gerhard
and
i
turned
the
corner
which
led
to
the
building
that
held
the
post
i
had
saved
that
for
the
last
i
hope
that
heaven
is
not
a
place
of
golden
streets
and
twanging
harps
and
angel
choruses
i
said
softly
little
nervous
slangy
restless
blackie
how
bored
and
ill
at
ease
he
would
be
in
such
a
heaven
how
lonely
without
his
old
black
pipe
and
his
checked
waistcoats
and
his
diamonds
and
his
sporting
extra
oh
i
hope
they
have
all
those
comforting
everyday
things
up
there
for
blackie
how
you
grew
to
understand
him
in
that
short
year
mused
von
gerhard
i
sometimes
used
to
resent
the
bond
between
you
and
this
little
blackie
whose
name
was
always
on
your
ah
that
was
because
you
did
not
comprehend
it
is
given
to
very
few
women
to
know
the
beauty
of
a
man
real
friendship
that
was
the
bond
between
blackie
and
me
to
me
he
was
a
comrade
and
to
him
i
was
a
girl
one
to
whom
he
could
talk
without
excusing
his
pipe
or
cigarette
love
and
were
things
to
bring
a
kindly
amused
chuckle
from
von
gerhard
was
silent
something
in
his
silence
held
a
vague
irritation
for
me
i
extracted
a
penny
from
my
purse
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
i
was
thinking
he
said
that
none
are
so
blind
as
those
who
will
not
i
do
understand
i
said
puzzled
that
is
well
answered
von
gerhard
as
we
entered
the
building
that
is
as
it
should
and
he
would
say
nothing
more
the
last
edition
of
the
paper
had
been
run
off
for
the
day
i
had
purposely
waited
until
the
footfalls
of
the
last
departing
reporter
should
have
ceased
to
echo
down
the
long
corridor
the
city
room
was
deserted
except
for
one
figure
bent
over
a
pile
of
papers
and
proofs
norberg
the
city
editor
was
the
last
to
leave
as
always
his
desk
light
glowed
in
the
darkness
of
the
big
room
and
his
typewriter
alone
awoke
the
echoes
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
he
peered
up
from
beneath
his
green
and
waved
a
cloud
of
smoke
away
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
that
you
orme
he
called
out
lord
we
missed
you
that
new
woman
ca
write
an
obituary
and
her
teary
tales
sound
like
they
were
carved
with
a
cold
chisel
when
are
you
coming
back
i
not
coming
back
i
replied
i
come
to
say
to
you
and
norberg
looked
up
quickly
you
feel
that
way
too
funny
so
do
the
rest
of
us
sometimes
i
think
we
are
all
half
sure
that
it
is
only
another
of
his
impish
tricks
and
that
some
morning
he
will
pop
open
the
door
of
the
city
room
here
and
call
out
slaves
been
keepin
memory
green
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
gratefully
he
took
it
in
his
great
palm
and
a
smile
dimpled
his
plump
cheeks
going
to
blossom
into
a
regular
little
writer
h
well
they
say
it
a
paying
game
when
you
get
the
hang
of
it
and
i
guess
you
got
it
but
if
ever
you
feel
that
you
want
a
real
thrill
a
touch
of
the
old
satisfying
newspaper
feeling
a
sniff
of
wet
ink
the
music
of
some
editorial
cussing
why
come
up
here
and
i
give
you
the
hottest
assignment
on
my
list
if
i
have
to
take
it
away
from
deming
very
when
i
had
thanked
him
i
crossed
the
hall
and
tried
the
door
of
the
sporting
editor
room
von
gerhard
was
waiting
for
me
far
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
the
door
opened
and
i
softly
entered
and
shut
it
again
the
little
room
was
dim
but
in
the
i
could
see
that
callahan
had
changed
something
had
shoved
a
desk
nearer
the
window
or
swung
the
typewriter
over
to
the
other
side
i
resented
it
i
glanced
up
at
the
corner
where
the
shabby
old
office
coat
had
been
wont
to
hang
there
it
dangled
untouched
just
as
he
had
left
it
callahan
had
not
dared
to
change
that
i
over
to
the
corner
and
touched
it
gently
with
my
fingers
a
light
pall
of
dust
had
settled
over
the
worn
little
garment
but
i
knew
each
worn
place
each
each
scorch
or
burn
from
pipe
or
cigarette
i
passed
my
hands
over
it
reverently
and
gently
and
then
in
the
dimness
of
that
quiet
little
room
i
laid
my
cheek
against
the
rough
cloth
so
that
the
scent
of
the
old
black
pipe
came
back
to
me
once
more
and
a
new
spot
appeared
on
the
coat
sleeve
a
damp
salt
spot
blackie
would
have
hated
my
doing
that
but
he
was
not
there
to
see
and
one
spot
more
or
less
did
not
matter
it
was
such
a
grimy
disreputable
old
coat
dawn
called
von
gerhard
softly
outside
the
door
dawn
coming
kindchen
i
gave
the
little
coat
a
parting
pat
goodby
i
whispered
under
my
breath
and
turned
toward
the
door
coming
i
called
aloud
