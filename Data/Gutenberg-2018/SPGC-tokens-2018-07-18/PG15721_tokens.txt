the

call

just
as
damaris
followed
closely
by
wellington
her
bulldog
turned
out
of
the
narrow
street
into
the
khan
shrill
and
sweet
from
far
and
near
it
came
calling
the
faithful
to

impelling
merchants
to
leave
their
wares
buyers
their
purchases
gossips
their
chatter
and
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
mecca
and
offer
their
praise
to

who
is
god
as
the
entire
male
population
of
the
native
quarter
knelt
the
girl
drew
back
beneath
an
awning
of
many
colours
which
shaded
silken
goods
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
whilst
curious
eyes
peeped
down
upon
her
from
behind
the
shelter
of
the
the
harem
lattice
of
wood
yards
of
silk
of
every

lay
tumbled
inside
and
outside

or
shop
in
the

plain
and
embroidered
hung
from

silk
shawls
were
spread
upon

carpets
a
veritable
riot
of
colour
against
the
plaster

flamed
the

the
or
the
talked
softly
together
as
they
watched
the
beautiful
girl
who
serenely
and
quite
unveiled
walked
amongst
men
with
an
animal
of
surpassing
hideousness
at
her
heels
she
stood
with
her
head
uncovered
it
is
permissible
at
sunset
and
with
her
face
lifted
as
she
listened
to
the
call
to
prayer
so
that
a
silting
in
through
the
silks
blazed
down
upon
the
positively
red
curls
which
rioted
all
over
her
head
and
were
of
a
tone
sharper
than
henna
yet
many
times
removed
from
the
shades
of
red
known
as
carrots
or
ginger
her
skin
was
her
mouth
crimson
and
curved
the
teeth
perfect
and
her
eyes
of
so
deep
a
purple
as
to
appear
black
she
was
slim
and
supple
unencumbered
by
anything
more
confining
than
a
a
fortnight
off
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
entirely
lovable
in
looks
ways
and
temperament
in
the
eyes
of
all
mankind
which
includes
women
the
prayer
over
and
the
men
again
about
the
business
of
the
hour
she
enquired
her
way
of
the
vendor
of
silks
who
having
quickly
replaced
his
shoes
had
as
hastily
returned
to
his
shop
his
heart
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
perhaps
one
or
two
hours
more
bargaining
for
where
is
to
be
found
the
oriental
who
knows
the
value
of
time
loving
animals
damaris
wanted
to
find
that
corner
near
the
where
can
be
purchased
anything
from
a
camel
to
a
hunting
cheetah
a
greyhound
to
a
falcon
it
is
not
wise
for
european
women
to
saunter
about
the
old
arabian
quarter
unaccompanied
especially
if
they
have
been
blessed
by
the
gods
in
the
ways
of
looks
damaris
hethencourt
most
certainly
ought
not
to
have
been
there
but
you
must
perforce
follow
the
path
fate
has
marked
out
for
you
whether
it
leads
through
country
lanes
or
piccadilly
or
the
arab
quarter
of
cairo
the
vendor
of
silks
salaamed
deeply
before
her
beauty
and
the
graciousness
of
her
manner
for
she
smiled
when
she
talked
and
spoke
the
prettiest
broken
arabic
in
the
world
so
putting
the
huge
bulldog
which
one
day
was
to
claim
the
proud
title
of
champion
on
the
leash
she
wended
her
way
through
the
narrow
streets
in
which
two
camels
may
scarce
squeeze
past
each
other
and
where
the
of
the
harems
almost
meet
overhead
camels
lowly
women
in
black
gown

donkeys

continually

by

only
and

and
a

does
not
always

that
appointment
damaris
turned
suddenly
into
the
market
and
hurriedly
looked
round
for
shelter
which
she
found
in
an
arched
doorway
leading
to
the
usual
court
of
the
native
house
zulannah
the
courtesan
peered
down
upon
her
from
between
the
silken
curtains
of
her
balcony
and
clapped
her
hands
twice
so
that
her
ran
quickly
to
watch
and
whisper
about
this
white
woman
who
stood
unattended
in
the
open
market
they
giggled
in
the
insufferable
eastern
way
and
pointed
across
the
square
where
the
whole
of
the
male
population
surged
about
two
men
but
zulannah
the
recognised
beauty
of
the
north
of
egypt
shrugged
her
dimpled
shoulders
as
she
stuffed
portions
of
sweetmeats
between
her
dazzling
teeth
and
stretched
herself
upon
a
divan
to
watch
the
scene
over
the
way
abdul
falconer
of
shammar
bearded
and
stood
with
a
of
jaraza
upon
his
fist
and
a
hooded
eyess
which
means
a
young
hawk
or
nestling
taken
from
the
nest
of
the
same
species
upon
a
padded
and
spiked
perch
beside
him
whilst
hooded
or
with
seeled
eyes
upon
perch
or
bough
were
other
yellow
or
birds
of
prey
hawks
a
bearded
vulture
a
hobby
a
passage
saker
but
it
was
not
upon
abdul
or
his
stock
that
the
girl
eyes
rested
nor
peradventure
the
eyes
behind
the
silken
curtains
the
central
figure
of
the
glowing
picture
was
that
of
hugh
carden
ali
the
eldest
and
son
of
hahmed
the
sheikh
and
jill
his
beautiful
english
and
one
and
only
wife
the
son
conceived
in
a
surpassing
love
and
born
upon
the
desert
sands
an
englishman
said
damaris
softly
as
she
withdrew
yet
further
into
the
sheltering
doorway
and
unleashed
the
dog
and
still
further
back
when
the
man
suddenly
turned
and
looked
across
the
square
as
though
in
search
of
someone
no
a
native
she
added
as
she
noticed
the
crimson
and
yet
she
was
by
no
means
the
first
to
wonder
as
to
the
nationality
of
the
man
in
with
boots
from
peter
yapp
he
looked
except
for
the
headcovering
exactly
like
an
englishman
certainly
the
shape
of
the
face
was
slightly
more
oval
than
is
common
to
the
sons
of
a
northern
race
but
nothing
really
out
of
the
ordinary
just
as
the
eyes
were
an
ordinary
kind
of
brown
with
a
disconcerting
way
of
looking
suddenly
into
your
face
sweeping
it
in
an
lightning
glance
and
looking
indifferently
away
the
nose
was
good
and
quite
straight
the
hair
thick
brown
and
controllable
the
mouth
covering
the
perfect
teeth
was
deceptive
or
maybe
it
was
the
strength
of
the
jaw
which
belied
the
gentleness
just
as
the
slimness
of
the
of
body
trained
to
a
hair
from
babyhood
gave
no
clue
to
the
steel
muscles
underlying
a
skin
as
white
as
and
a
good
deal
whiter
than
that
of
some
europeans
he
moved
with
the
quickness
and
quietness
of
those
accustomed
to
the
far
horizon
as
a
background
he
was
slow
in
speech
and
in
anger
until
aroused
by
opposition
for
the
physically
he
had
the
gentle
sympathy
of
the
very
strong
for
the
physically
undeveloped
and
the
morally
weak
he
had
no
use
whatever
in
the
west
his
reserve
with
men
had
been
labelled
taciturnity
or
which
did
not
fit
the
case
at
all
whilst
in
spite
of
his
perfect
manner
towards
them
his
indifference
to
woman
or
in
the
individual
was
supreme
and
sincere
he
was
the
direct
descendant
of
the
founder
of
nineveh
where
horses
were
concerned
and
his
stables
in
the
oasis
of
khargegh
would
have
been
one
of
the
sights
of
egypt
had
he
permitted
sightseers
educated
at
harrow
where
he
had
excelled
in
sport
and
captained
the
eleven
at
lord
for
two
succeeding
years
respected
by
the
upper
forms
and
worshipped
by
the
lower
he
had
developed
the
english
side
of
his
dual
nationality
until
masters
and
schoolfellows
had
come
to
look
upon
him
as
one
of
themselves
from
harrow
he
had
gone
to
brazenose
then
had
quite
suddenly
thrown
up
the
and
returned
to
egypt
love
not
at
all
for
was
not
his
indifference
to
woman
supreme
and
sincere
just
the
inevitable
ending
of
a
very
commonplace
sordid
little
story
which
had
taught
the
youth
one
of
life
bitterest
lessons
one
of
a
multitude
of
guests
at
hurdley
castle
he
had
met
a
woman
beautiful
but
predatory
whose
looks
were
taking
on
an
autumnal
tint
and
whose
banking
account
had
shrivelled
under
the
frost
of
extravagance
his
utter
indifference
to
her
wiles
and
her
beauty
had
culminated
in
a
degrading
scene
of
anger
on
her
part
when
forgetting
her
breeding
her
birth
and
her
nationality
she
had
first
of
all
twitted
him
and
then
openly
laughed
at
his
mixed
parentage
he
had
stood
without
uttering
a
word
white
to
the
lips
during
her
tirade
do
you
think
that
any
white
woman
would
marry
you
a
had
cried
the
woman
whose
bills
were
coming
in
in
shoals
yes
many
he
had
quietly
answered
as
he
bent
to
pick
up
her
torn
handkerchief
am
i
not
a
rich
man
he
had
returned
to
egypt
upon
a
visit
to
the
flat
oasis
where
dwelt
his
parents
who
though
noting
the
indescribable
hurt
in
the
eyes
of
their
firstborn
yet
asked
no
question
for
in
egypt
a
youth
is
his
own
master
and
ofttimes
married
at
the
age
of
fourteen
how
much
more
therefore
is
he
a
man
at
over
twenty
years
he
had
visited
his
own
house
in
the
oasis
of
khargegh
with
the
purpose
of
putting
his
stables
in
order
and
his
falconers
through
a
stiff
catechism
and
had
finally
set
out
to
see
something
of
the
world
not
in
a
desire
to
cover
his
hurt
for
he
was
as
stoical
as
any
arab
and
mohammedan
from
belief
as
well
as
early
training
did
not
kick
against
what
he
looked
upon
as
the
commands
of
allah
as
for
women
well
the
sweet
docile
woman
of
his
father
race
interested
him
not
at
all
so
that
he
refused
to
listen
to
any
hint
anent
the
desirability
of
his
taking
a
wife
and
establishing
the
succession
of
the
house
mahabbha
which
is
the
eldest
branch
of
the
house
and
racial
distinction
barred
him
from
the
virile
lovely
women
of
his
mother
race
he
had
his
horses
his
hawks
his
hunting
cheetahs
his
dogs
one
great
treasure
which
he
prized
and
one
little
conceit
the
treasure
had
been
found
in
the
ruins
of
the
temple
an
ornament
of
gold
set
with
precious
stones
its
shape
was
that
of
the
hawk
which
had
stood
as
the
symbol
of
the
north
in
the
glorious
days
of
ancient
egypt
the
wings
were
of
emeralds
tipped
with
rubies
gold
were
the
claws
and
gold
the
symbol
of
life
they
held
the
body
and
tail
were
a
mass
of
precious
stones
and
the
eye
of
some
stone
unknown
to
the
present
century
as
an
ornament
it
was
of
great
value
as
an
antiquity
found
in
the
shrine
of
anubis
the
god
of
death
its
value
could
not
even
be
guessed
at
and
how
it
had
come
into
the
possession
of
hugh
garden
ali
will
never
be
known
though
of
a
truth
unlimited
wealth
works
wonders
and
upon
his
horses
his
falcons
hoods
his
coats
and
the
fine
linen
and
satins
of
his
eastern
raiment
he
had
the
emblem
worked
in
thread
or
silk
or
jewels
or
painted
in
soft
colours
it
was
just
a
pretty
conceit
but
in
conjunction
with
of
his
lineage
and
his
love
for
his
birds
it
had
earned
him
the
title
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
and
such
was
the
man
as
he
stood
in
the
having
followed
the
path
which
fate
had
marked
out
for
him
through
the
twisting
lanes
of
the

should
not
have
been
strolling
by
herself
in

if
you
are
drab
or
flat
of
chest
or
soul
or
face
you
can
saunter
your
fill
in

without
adventure
befalling
you
if
however
nature
should
have
endowed
you
with
the
colouring
of
a
desert
sunset
if
in
short
you
add
a
splash
of
colour
to
anything
so
colourful
as
a
native
bazaar
then
wise
to
do
your
sauntering
under
the
wing
of
a
vigilant
chaperon
so
that
the
curiosity
and
interest
resultant
on
your
splash
may
reach
you
obliquely
and
as
through
a
glass
darkly
but
there
was
no
one
to
worry
the
girl
at
this
hour
before
sunset
so
that
little
by
little
and
quite
unconsciously
she
moved
forward
until
she
stood
outside
the
doorway
she
stood
outlined
against
a
background
of
blazing
colours
which
served
in
no
way
to
dim
her
beauty
through
the
arch
of
the
doorway
showed
a
stretch
of
sky
across
which
upon
a
string
swung
golden
onions
and
scarlet
peppercorns
whilst
underneath
ruminated
a
fine
superbly
indifferent
dromedary
for
a
moment
hugh

jogged
by

looked
straight
across
at
the
beautiful
picture
staying
his
talk
with

with

courtesy
of
the
east
did
not
turn
his
head
as
he
stroked
the
breast
and
head
of
the
on
his
fist
but
damaris
with
envy
rampant
in
her
heart
had
no
eyes
for
mere
man
she
wanted
to
walk
across
and
get
near
the
stallion
from
unayza
a
district
famous
for
its
breed
of
large
horses
he
stood
impatiently
with
an
occasional
plunk
of
a
hoof
on
the
sandy
stones
or
nuzzled
his
master
sleeve
or
pulled
at
it
with
his
teeth
whilst
two
shaggy
dogs
of
billi
lay
stretched
out
awaiting
the
signal
to
be
up
and
going
perhaps
in
a
sprint
across

greyhounds
and
a
dog
or
so
from
billi
get
right
off
the
tourist
track
and
let
the
red
rascal
out
and
see
if
you
do
have
some
fun
before
breakfast
only
get
off
the
tourist
track
else
you
will
have
all
the
bazaar
camels
and
ponies
loping
along
behind
you
the
only
wild
beast
this
afternoon
for
sale
was
a
jaguar
black
as
ink
smooth
as
satin
short
heavy
with
green
eyes
fixed
steadfastly
upon
a
plump
white
pigeon
foolishly
strutting
just
out
of
reach
of
the
claws
take
her
upon
thy
fist
o
master
said
abdul
of
shammar
as
he
lengthened
the
jesses
the
short
narrow
straps
of
leather
or
woven
silk
or
cotton
with
which
to
hold
the
hawk
see
she
is
well
reclaimed
being
tame
and
gentle
and
altogether
amiable
when
thrown
she
is
as
a
bullet
from
a
rifle
binding
her
quarry
in
high
air
even
as
a
man
holds
his
woman
to
his
heart
upon
the
under
the
stars
she
is
full
summed
and
he
ran
his
slender
fingers
through
the
new
feathers
full
and
soft
after
moulting
she
is
keen
as
the
winter
wind
behold
the
worn
and
blunted
nails
she
will
not
give
up
my
master
yet
will
she
come
to
the
lure
as
quickly
as
joyfully
as
a
maid
to
her
lover
hugh
carden
ali
the
greatest
authority
after
abdul
on
the
took
the
bird
upon
his
fist
looked
at
the
sunken
piercing
eyes
which
were
partially
seeled
ran
his
hand
over
the
narrow
body
short
tail
and
black
back
and
a
finger
over
the
large
beak
and
deep
mouth
held
up
the
ugly
face
to
the
light
examined
the
and
moving
his
hand
quickly
up
and
down
caused
the
bird
to
flutter
its
wings
and
so
give
him
a
chance
of
measuring
the
distance
of
the
wings
from
the
body
finding
her
altogether
lovely
he
nodded
and
handed
her
back
to
the
delighted
falconer
of
shammar
just
as
with
a
decisive
pat
the
jaguar
landed
its
huge
paw
upon
the
strutting
pigeon
which
had
forgotten
to
keep
its
distance
for
a
moment
the
attention
of
the
spectators
who
were
mostly
squatting
on
their
heels
was
diverted
from
the
master
and
the
falconer
they
laughed
they
moved
whilst
some
in
the
back
row
stood
up
to
see
the
fun
leaving
for
one
second
an
open
space
through
which
damaris
could
see
the
fluttering
white
bird
ah
she
cried
heartbroken
at
the
sight
then
fetch
she
commanded
the
dog
pointing
across
the
square
now
the
dog
who
had
dispensed
with
his
spiked
collar
on
account
of
the
heat
had
no
more
idea
than
the
man
in
the
moon
what
he
had
to
fetch
for
his
beloved
mistress
but
restless
from
prolonged
inactivity
and
the
smell
of
strange
beasts
he
hurled
himself
in
the
direction
pointed
and
his
speed
once
he
got
going
was
as
surprising
as
that
of
the
elephant
or
rhinoceros
and
other
animals
and
in
very
truth
his
appearance
was
just
as
terrifying
he
crashed
into
the
back
row
of
spectators
which
as
one
man
yelled
and
fled
tore
along
the
path
made
clear
for
him
and
sensing
an
enemy
in
the
growling
jaguar
was
at
its
throat
like
a
thrown
spear
missing
it
by
an
inch
as
the
black
beast
flung
itself
back
to
the
full
length
of
the
steel
chain
which
fastened
it
to
an
iron
ring
in
the
ground
damaris
in
her
turn
rushed
across
the
square
passing
the
astounded
spectators
who
salaamed
as
she
ran
and
as
she
ran
she
shouted
let
the
animal
loose
she
cried
give
it
a
chance
let
it
loose
but
hugh
carden
ali
not
in
the
least
understanding
the
sudden
onslaught
but
with
every
sporting
instinct
uppermost
had
already
leant
down
in
the
seething
growling
mass
of
fur
and
hate
and
loosened
the
chain
whilst
with
screams
of
fear
and
delight
the
crowd
raced
for
the
adjacent
houses
from
the
upper
windows
of
which
they
could
hang
in
safety
to
watch
the
fight
disgusting
quite
so
but
have
you
ever
heard
of
or
in
civilised
humane
europe
there
followed
a
frightful
scene
during
which
abdul
having
picked
up
the
pigeon
hastily
flung
his
birds
far
behind
the
growling
spitting
raging
couple
whilst
the
stallion
rearing
in
terror
nearly
jerked
his
master
who
had
the
bridle
slipped
over
his
arm
off
his
feet
the
two
dogs
of
billi
and
the
two
greyhounds
leapt
and
barked
and
snapped
at
the
belligerents
until
wellington
taking
an
suddenly
turned
and
bit
one
of
them
clean
through
the
shoulder
whereupon
it
yelped
and
howled
and
fled
whilst
shouts
of
and
much
clapping
came
from
the
upper
windows
damaris
ran
straight
towards
the
man
who
slipping
the
bridle
put
both
arms
round
her
to
draw
her
to
safety
then
suddenly
realising
the
beauty
the
youth
and
the
pure
whiteness
of
her
as
suddenly
let
her
go
shall
i
separate
them
he
asked
simply
no
not
even
if
you
could
once
my
dog
blood
is
up
nothing
but
death
will
satisfy
him
she
stood
quite
still
as
white
as
a
sheet
with
both
hands
on
his
arm
whilst
the
great
dog
hurled
himself
at
the
spitting
brute
only
to
meet
the
teeth
and
claws
which
drew
blood
at
every
attempt
until
the
ground
was
crimson
where
they
fought
and
then
with
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
damaris
looked
up
into
the
man
face
then
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
the
seed
of
love
which
is
in
the
heart
of
every
human
burst
through
the
clogging
mould
of
custom
and
convention
and
taking
root
put
forth
shoots
and
sprang
in
one
moment
into
the
great
tree
of
love
of
which
the
fruits
being
those
of
purity
honour
and
sacrifice
are
golden
yet
he
did
not
touch
her
having
learned
his
lesson
instead
he
raised
his
right
hand
above
his
head
allah
he
said
in
praise
of
that
which
had
come
unto
him
allah
there
is
no
god
but
thee
just
as
with
a
sudden
swish
a
flock
of
startled
pigeons
flashing
like
jewels
in
the
setting
sun
new
low
down
across
his
head
bringing
an
end
to
the
battle
for
one
the
jaguar
green
eyes
shifted
and
the
dog
was
at
its
throat
there
was
a
mighty
convulsive
effort
of
the
which
ripped
the
bulldog
sides
a
click
a
shiver
and
the
black
brute
fell
dead
as
the
dog
a
mass
of
blood
foam
and
pride
hurled
himself
onto
the
skirt
of
his
beloved
mistress
whilst
the
enraptured
spectators
yelling
with
excitement
rushed
out
into
the
square
with
shouts
of
which
means
well
done
well
done
keep
quite
still
said
hugh
carden
ali
gently
as
damaris
made
an
effort
to
turn
then
speaking
quickly
to
the
beaming
salaaming
spectators
who
had
had
the
time
of
their
lives
gambling
on
the
chances
of
either
animal
ordered
them
to
remove
the
dead
beast
and
to
strew
the
place
with
sand
and
he
called
to
the
stallion
which
terrified
at
the
sounds
and
sight
and
smell
of
battle
had
bolted
up
a
side
street
where
he
stood
fretting
and
fidgeting
himself
into
a
fine
sweat
until
he
heard
the
clear
call
which
could
always
bring
him
back
to
the
man
he
loved
he
stood
for
one
second
then
flung
up
his
heels
to
the
devastation
of
a
stall
of
earthenware
and
raced
back
to
the
square
at
a
most
unseemly
pace
causing
the
spectators
once
more
to
fly
in
all
directions
with
cries
of
which
means
look
out
look
out
he
pushed
his
soft
nose
with
determination
against
the
woman
who
stood
so
close
to
his
master
so
that
she
looked
up
and
then
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
arms
you
beauty
she
cried
oh
you
you
ride
damaris
thinking
of
the
hack
the
only
thing
with
the
shape
of
a
horse
she
had
been
able
to
get
so
far
and
upon
the
back
of
which
she
loathed
to
be
seen
made
a
grimace
i
go
out
on
horseback
she
said
i
have
not
ridden
since
i
left
home
the
man
reply
whatever
it
might
have
been
was
interrupted
by
abdul
who
all
smiles
stood
before
them
with
the
white
pigeon
in
the
left
hand
and
the
upon
his
right
fist
the
native
had
no
intention
of
causing
the
white
woman
pain
in
fact
wishing
to
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
nobles
he
only
wanted
to
give
them
a
chance
of
witnessing
a
little
of
to
him
the
finest
sport
in
the
world
look
lady
he
cried
he
tossed
the
pigeon
high
into
the
air
allowed
her
a
little
distance
then
threw
the
hawk
no
oh
no
do
cried
damaris
as
the
hawk
rose
stooped
and
missed
the
pigeon
by
a
as
it
put
in
which
means
that
it
flew
straight
into
a
small
niche
of
a
minaret
for
cover
ah
cried
damaris
and
ejaculated
abdul
as
he
threw
the
lure
of
a
dead
plover
and
called
his
hawk
with
the
luring
eastern
call
he
called
to
which
the
hawk
responded
as
a
should
hugh
carden
ali
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
stallion
mane
looking
up
at
the
sky
in
which
shone
a
great
star
the
hawk
of
egypt
failed
he
said
to
himself
flown
at
a
white
bird
it
failed
the
house
of
allah
who
is
god
gave
sanctuary
to
the
little
white
bird
praise
be
to
allah
who
is
god
he
looked
down
at
the
girl
who
was
kneeling
consoling
the
dog
who
reft
pride
and
pain
showed
a
lamentable
countenance
suddenly
she
looked
up
and
rose
and
stood
silently
come
he
said
simply
while
he
longed
to
pick
her
up
and
ride
with
her
to
his
home
in
the
oasis
i
will
take
you
to
your
hotel
my
car
is
waiting
for
me
in
the
sikket
she
replied
later
a
vision
of
loveliness
she
walked
down
the
behind
the
duchess
of
longacres
whilst
continuous
lamentations
were
wafted
through
the
from
the
spot
where
sat
a
dog
with
across
his
nose
and
middle
girt
with
a
cummerbund
of
pink
boracic
lint
beside
the
girl
place
lay
a
huge
bunch
of
crimson
roses
tied
with
golden
tassels
there
was
no
card
name
nor
message
she
asked
no
question
neither
did
her
godmother
to
what
purpose
should
they
the
one
the
other
firmly
believed
in
allowing
the
young
to
work
out
the
salvation
of
their
own
souls
which
did
not
however
mean
that
she
would
not
keep
a
sharp
in
the
future
over
the
troubled
sea
of
life
i
knew
something
would
happen
thought
the
wise
old
lady
as
she
passed
a
biscuit
up
to
the
parrot
on
her
shoulder
it
said
delightedly
it
merely
means
thank
you
but
had
taken
weeks
of
teaching
and
repeating
to
master
chapter
iii
lor
but
women
rum
cattle
to
deal
with
the
first
man
found
that
to
his
cost
and
i
reckon
it
just
through
a
woman
that
the
last
man
on
earth
be
lost
sims
damaris
was
the
only
daughter
of
squire
hethencourt
her
mother
was
an
italian
from
the
udino
where
the
hair
of
the
women
is
genuine
and
the
eyes
are
blue
which
perhaps
accounted
for
her
colouring
and
some
part
of
her
temperament
her
type
of
beauty
was
certainly
remarkable
given
it
must
be
confessed
to
a
certain
amount
of
fluctuation
and
she
danced
divinely
which
gift
must
not
be
counted
as
a
she
was
slow
in
her
movements
and
quiet
in
her
manner
until
she
talked
of
horses
or
anybody
she
loved
then
her
great
eyes
would
flash
and
her
laugh
ring
out
also
she
would
gesticulate
as
her
mother
had
been
wont
to
do
until
the
climate
maybe
of
a
northern
country
had
served
to
repress
the
spontaneity
of
her
latin
mannerisms
she
was
simple
and
unsophisticated
and
would
have
made
a
splendid
little
chum
if
only
one
out
of
every
three
men
who
met
her
had
not
been
consumed
with
a
desire
to
annex
her
for
life
by
means
of
a
gold
ring
dads
she
exclaimed
two
months
before
the
beginning
of
this
story
having
enticed
him
to
her
bedroom
one
night
and
offered
him
cream
chocolates
as
he
eat
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
facing
her
dads
what
am
i
to
do
guy
danvers

he
is

to
see

i
am
sure

to
be

the
how

the
number

the
awful
they
got
into
and
i
do
understand
anything
and
i
do
encourage
them
do
i
do
lend
me
a
hankie
this
chocolate
has
burst
and
what
am
i
to
do
turn
a
deaf
ear
or
a
cold
shoulder
or
put
a
brave
face
on
until
said
dads
retrieving
his
handkerchief
until
what
until
the
right
man
comes
along
darling
as
he
surely
will
the
girl
lids
suddenly
dropped
until
the
lashes
lay
like
a
fringe
upon
the
white
cheek
over
which
very
slowly
but
very
surely
crept
the
faintest
of
hum
said
dads
to
himself
as
he
made
great
use
of
the
hankie
do
smoke
dearest
no
thank
you
pet
i
could
here
the
man
who
worshipped
his
wife
and
adored
his
little
daughter
looked
round
the
white
and
somewhat
austere
room
and
ran
his
eye
over
the
bookstand
at
his
elbow
books
on
horses
a
treatise
on
bulldogs
the
new
testament
essays
in
french
and
in
german
the
history
of
egypt
in
arabic
budge
book
of
the
dead
and
king
solomon
mines
but
what
am
i
do
dads
and
the
girl
threw
out
her
hands
imploringly
be
cold
deaf
or
brave
golliwog
as
i
have
suggested
but
i
been
all
that
and
it
quite
useless
do
you
think
it
would
help
if
i
let
my
hair
grow
and
did
it
up
in
a
tight
knob
i
think
it
would
help
a
lot
if
you
shaved
your
head
entirely
kiddie
and
the
man
leant
forward
and
ran
his
hand
through
the
red
curls
once
upon
a
time
damaris
had
read
the
advertisement
of
a
certain
powder
guaranteed
to
darken
hair
of
any
colour
and
life
having
been
one
long
torment
owing
to
her
violent
colouring
she
had
greatly
daring
acquired
a
packet
had
followed
the
directions
by
mixing
the
powder
with
water
and
covering
her
head
with
the
muddy
result
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
had
sat
with
her
clay
pate
for
an
hour
instead
of
ten
minutes
near
a
fire
had
cracked
the
clay
washed
her
head
and
found
her
hair
she
had
chopped
the
verdant
masses
off
without
a
thought
and
had
ever
after
refused
to
allow
it
to
grow
to
hairpin
length
and
to
her
father
only
had
granted
the
privilege
of
calling
her
by
the
pet
name
of
golliwog
would
you
like
to
travel
a
bit
pet
and
the
man
smiled
though
his
heart
was
heavy
at
the
thought
of
the
blank
which
his
departure
would
leave
in
the
home
and
the
daily
round
travel
travel
oh
darling
to
egypt
why
egypt
why
not
france
or
or
italy
because
i
to
go
to
egypt
sometime
or
another
dads
i
got
to
see
the
desert
and
the
mosques
and
the
whites
and
blues
and
oranges
and
camels
it
me
and
she
thumped
her
nightgown
above
her
heart
i
shall
never
be
happy
until
i
have
seen
them
all
oh
dads
i
wonder
if
you
can
understand
it
it
sounds
so
so
silly
tell
me
and
the
man
moved
over
to
the
head
of
the
bed
and
took
his
daughter
gently
in
his
arms
i
so
out
of
the
picture
somehow
here
dearest
said
the
child
striving
as
best
she
could
to
describe
what
was
really
only
the
passing
of
the
between
girl
and
womanhood
this
terrible
colouring
of
mine
for
one
thing
why
amongst
other
girls
i
am
like
a
raemaeker
stuffed
into
a
heath
robinson
folio
like
a
palette
daubed
with
oils
hung
amongst
a
lot
of
i
want
to
find
my

hang
for
one
hour
by
myself
if
it
on
a
or
the
wall
of
a
mosque
as
long
as
i
am
by
myself
good
lord
said
the
man
inwardly
as
he
patted
his
daughter
arm
then
aloud
as
it
happens
golliwog
darling
i
had
a
letter
from
yesterday
asking
me
to
let
you
go
out
to
her
in
cairo
for
the
winter
and
see
as
much
as
possible
of
the
ordinary
sights

it
over
with
mother
oh
dads
how
wonderful
and
ca
you
and
mother
come
and
oh
i
take
wellington
i
think
so
dear
if
he
has
hydrophobia
and
the
man
bent
to
pat
the
head
of
the
great
dog
which
had
crept
from
under
the
bed
at
the
sound
of
his
name
and
later
dads
stood
at
his
window
smoking
two
last
pipes
whilst
a
glimpse
into
the
future
was
allowed
him
can
it
be
can
it
possibly
be
he
said
puffing
clouds
of
smoke
into
the
creeper
to
the
annoyance
of
many
insects
big
ben
kelham
and
the
estates
run
alongside
wonder
if
teresa
has
noticed
anything
and
by
jove
of
course
he
at
heliopolis
getting
over
his
hunting
accident
i
wonder
and
damaris
sat
at
her
window
with
her
arms
round
the
dog
who
longed
inordinately
for
his
mat
the
desert
she
whispered
the
pyramids
the
bazaar
life
adventure
how
there
came
a
long
long
pause
and
then
she
added
as
she
turned
towards
a
coloured
picture
of
the
sphinx
upon
the
wall
and
who
cares
if
the
nail
is
a
or
a
screw
as
it
happened
it
was
destined
to
be
the
unsheathed
dagger
of
love
and
fate
having
mislaid
her
glasses
worked
her
shuttle
at
hazard
in
and
out
of
that
picture
of
intricate
pattern
called
life
and
having
tangled
and
knotted
together
the
crimson
thread
of
passion
the
golden
thread
of
youth
and
the
honest
brown
of
a
deep
undemonstrative
love
she
left
the
disentanglement
of
the
muddle
in
the
hands
of
olivia
duchess
of
longacres
her
grace
was
over
eighty
of
a
line
of
yeomen
ancestors
ranging
back
down
the
centuries
to
the
william
carew
who
had
fought
for
harold
she
had
been
about
years
ago
the
belle
of
devon
against
the
warnings
of
her
heart
and
to
the
delight
of
her
friends
and
family
she
had
married
the
duke
of
longacres
whose
roving
eye
had
been
arrested
by
her
beauty
at
a
meet
of
the
devon
and
somerset
and
his
equally
roving
heart
temporarily
captured
by
the
indifference
of
her
demeanour
towards
his
autocratic
self
she
had
lost
him
to
all
intents
and
purposes
two
years
after
the
marriage
but
blinding
her
eyes
and
stuffing
her
ears
had
held
high
her
beautiful
head
and
high
her
honour
filling
her
empty
heart
with
the
love
of
her
son
and
the
esteem
of
her
legion
of
real
friends
showing
the
bravest
of
beautiful
faces
to
the
world
until
a
happy
widowhood
had
set
her
free
some
years
of
absolute
happiness
of
the
simplest
kind
had
followed
the
marriage
of
her
son
and
birth
of
her
grandson
who
had
cost
his
mother
her
life
then
the
following
year
had
come
the
boer
war
and
the
heroic
tragedy
of
spion
kop
which
left
her
childless
after
that
many
years
of
utter
devotion
to
her
grandson
who
adored
her
then
the
great
war
and
the
battle
of
the
falkland
islands
which
left
her
absolutely
bereft
with
the
care
of
the
boy
greatest
treasure
even
the
grey
parrot
dekko
for
short
methuselah
of
birds
it
was
possessed
of
an
uncanny
gift
of
human
speech
and
understanding
and
had
been
promoted
through
generation
to
generation
from
merchant
service
to
british
navy
as
time
and
tragedy
worked
hard
together
to
silver
her
hair
and
line
her
face
so
did
a
veritable
imp
of
mischief
bred
of
her
desolation
seem
to
possess
the
old
darling
she
cared
not
a
brass
farthing
for
the
opinion
of
her
neighbours
so
that
after
the
death
of
the
great
queen
who
had
been
her
staunchest
friend
she
had
instructed
maria
hobson
her
maid
and
also
staunchest
friend
to
revive
the
faded
roses
of
her
cheeks
with
the
aid
of
cosmetics
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
in
that
respect
until
her
pretty
hair
had
been
covered
by
a
flagrant
golden
perruque
and
the
dear
old
face
with
a
mask
of
pink
and
white
enamel
her
eyes
were
blue
and
keen
as
a
hawk
undimmed
by
the
tears
shed
in
secret
during
her
tumultuous
and
tragic
life
her
teeth
each
one
in
a
perfect
and
pearly
state
of
preservation
were
her
own
for
which
asset
she
was
never
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
her
tongue
was
vitriolic
her
heart
of
pure
gold
and
she
owned
a
right
hand
which
said
nothing
to
the
left
of
the
spaces
between
its
fingers
through
which
daily
ran
deeds
of
kindness
and
streams
of
love
towards
the
unfortunate
ones
of
the
earth
her
dress
was
invariably
of
grey
taffeta
or
brocade
bunched
at
the
back
and
trailing
on
the
ground
there
were
ruffles
of
priceless
lace
at
the
and
neck
a
plain
straw
served
for
all
outdoor
functions
and
an
ebony
stick
called
the
wand
by
the
denizens
of
the
slums
who
adored
her
completed
her
picturesque
toilette
the
majority
feared
this
a
minority
if
they
had
had
the
chance
would
have
fawned
upon
her
in
public
and
laughed
at
or
caricatured
her
in
private
those
who
really
knew
her
and
they
lived
principally
east
of
london
town
would
willingly
have
laid
themselves
down
and
allowed
her
ridiculously
small
feet
invariably
shod
in
crimson
buckled
outrageously
shoes
to
trample
upon
their
prostrate
bodies
if
it
would
have
given
her
pleasure
so
to
do
she
adored
young
things
and
had
an
enormous
family
of
godsons
and
goddaughters
out
of
which
crowd
ben
kelham
and
damaris
hethencourt
were
supreme
favourites
and
about
whom
she
had
been
weaving
plots
when
she
had
written
her
letter
of
invitation
to
the
squire
she
smoked
three
castles
which
she
kept
in
a
jewelled
louis
xv
and
had
a
perfect
tartar
of
a
maid
who
simply
worshipped
her
of
a
truth
a
long
description
of
a
very
old
and
very
wise
old
woman
of
whom
the
great
queen
had
once
remarked
to
her
consort
i
wish
i
were
not
a
queen
so
that
might
curtsey
to
olivia
and
in
this
wise
old
woman
hands
fate
placed
the
twisted
threads
of
passion
youth
and
love
and
a
wiser
selection
she
could
not
have
made
a
bronchitic
cough
had
taken
her
to
cairo
just
as
a
lung
left
behind
by
the
pneumonia
which
had
followed
the
hunting
accident
had
taken
ben
kelham
to
heliopolis
and
for
recuperation
of
body
or
mind
there
is
nothing
to
equal

egyptian
winter

to

he
looked
upon
as
his
greatest

vice

educated
at
harrow
ben

been
known
on

as

that
the
crimson
golden
and
brown
threads
were
more
than
uncommonly
twisted
ben
was
heavy
in
build
and
slow
in
every
way
but
he
was
still
more
sure
than
slow
and
had
never
been
known
to
give
up
when
once
he
had
set
his
mind
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
task
and
although
he
had
stood
in
absolute
awe
of
beautiful
damaris
since
the
day
she
had
lengthened
her
skirts
yet
had

determined
to
make
her
his
wife

if
it
meant
following
in
jacob

the
tune
of
waiting
many
years

had
confided
his
determination
to
his
godmother

had
immediately
taken
the
case
in
hand
and
proceeded
to
throw
bucketsful
of
cold
water
upon
his
suggestion
of
being
on
the
quay
or
doorstep
to
welcome
the
girl
to
egypt
my
dear

replied
the
tactful
old
lady

she
rasped
a
match
on
the
sole
of
a
crimson
shoe

lit

fragrant

that
everything

will
be
one
vast
ejaculation
for
at

a
month
let
her
get
over
that
let
her
realise
that
you
are
close
at
hand
but
not
the
least
bit
anxious
to
be
under
her
feet
and
you
see
remember
she
is
very
young
just
like
a
bit
of
dough
which
must
be
stuffed
with
the
currants

raisins
of
knowledge

then
in

shown
no

incipient
hydrophobia
and
jane

her
maid
it
were
best
to
describe
them
both
now
and
so
get
it
all
over
whilst
waiting
one
exeat
upon
waterloo
station
the
girl
had
annexed
unto
herself
a
holy
terror
in
the
shape
of
a
brindle
the
hilarious
quadruped
had
twined
its
leash
about
one
leg
of
its
master
who
was
an
alien
from
wapping
and
the
spout
of
a
zinc
which
a
porter
had
left
upon
the
platform
for
which
joke
it
had
received
a
vile
cuff
on
its
wrinkled
physiognomy
from
the
alien
master
like
some
avenging
goddess
damaris
the
ladylike
almost
finished
product
of
onslow
house
sprang
straight
at
the
man
smote
him
with
the
flat
of
the
hand
upon
the
face
and
pounced
upon
the
yelping
pup
take
your
leg
out
of
the
dog
chain
you
idiot
she
cried
her
eyes
blazing
her
perfect
teeth
flashing
in
a
positive
snarl
be
quick
do
be
so
clumsy
how
dare
you
hit
a
dog

and
i

society
i
take

poun
for

child
fished
for
her
purse
which
contained
and
her
ticket
and
flung
it
with
a
supreme
gesture
of
contempt
at
the
feet
then
squeezing
up
the
dog
in
her
arms
tore
a
simple
gold
bracelet
off
her
left
arm
and
flung
it
after
the
purse
worv
two
poun
at
the
mos
then
from
out
of
a
carriage
of
the
train
waiting
to
start
for
southampton
slowly
descended
olivia
duchess
of
longacres
the
girl
and
the
alien
had
their
backs
turned
to
her
but
the
crowd
had
seen
had
looked
started
to
laugh
and
then
had
become
silent
so
great
was
the
dignity
of
the
old
lady
clad
in
a
voluminous
grey
taffeta
gown
from
under
which
peeped
little
crimson
shoes
covered
with
a
huge
loose
ermine
wrap
with
the
black
on
top
of
the
outrageous
golden
perruque
and
the
grey
parrot
bobbing
up
and
down
excitedly
upon
her
shoulder
she
stood
silently
taking
in
the
scene
there
was
the
light
of
battle
in
the
famous
as
she
listened
to
the
girl
defending
the
pup
and
her
splendid
teeth
shone
in
a
grin
of
enjoyment
as
she
suddenly
rattled
her
ebony
stick
upon
the
those
most
tender
bits
of
anatomical
scaffolding
there
was
a
yell
of
pain
as
the
alien
backed
hastily
into
the
arms
of
a
lusty
youth
who
had
continuously
besought
damaris
to
allow
him
ter
put
it
acrorst
ther
blighter
mug
and
a
cry
of
delight
as
damaris
ran
to
the
old
lady
side
and
squeezing
the
pup
in
one
arm
made
the
sweetest
little
reverence
in
the
pretty
continental
way
before
she
excitedly
wrung
her
hand
he
hit
the
puppy
and
i
bought
him
for
ten
pounds
at
least
dad

send
a
cheque

i
given
him
and
my
bracelet
on

said
her
grace
to
the
bird
who
obeying
had
shrilly
piped
tumble
up
men
tumble
up
until
hobson
the
maid
suddenly
surged
from
the
and
ploughed
her
way
through
the
delighted
crowd
give
the
purse
and
bracelet
to
my
maid
you
swab
supplemented
the
once
finished
her
grace
just
as
with
a
cry
of
dad
damaris
ran
to
meet
her
father
who
having
got
hung
up
in
the
traffic
had
failed
to
meet
the
train
he
listened
patiently
with
dancing
eyes
to
the
story
smiled
across
at
the
duchess
gave
the
man
a
and
a
jolly
good
talking
to
and
acquired
a
bull
pup
with
the
rodney
stone
strain
which
they
promptly
christened
wellington
as
it
had
won
at
waterloo
wellington
forthwith
developed
an
inordinate
jealousy
of
jane
coop
jane
coop
was
maid
adviser
and
buffer
to
the
girl
whom
she
loved
more
than
anyone
on
earth
born
on
the
squire
lands
she
had
developed
a
positive
genius
for
mothering
delicate
lambs
and
calves
and
sickly
chicks
so
that
when
a
crisis
had
arrived
almost
immediately
after
the
birth
of
damaris
the
squire
had
bundled
the
nurse
into
a
motor
and
sent
her
packing
back
to
london
and
called
upon
jane
coop
to
rise
to
the
occasion
she
had
risen
bonny
and
plump
she
had
taken
the
weakly
little
bit
of
humanity
also
the
situation
into
her
strong
capable
hands
treated
the
mother
and
babe
just
as
she
would
have
treated
a
couple
of
delicate
lambs
and
pulled
them
both
through
from
that
day
forth
she
had
dominated
the
house
tyrannised
over
the
squire
and
his
lady
defied
each
and
every
governess
who
had
shown
signs
of
undue
strictness
and
found
her
reward
for
her
devotion
in
the
love
of
the
child
who
teased
her
to
death
and
in
the
long
run
obeyed
her
she
had
shown
herself
a
positive
on
board
the
boat
she
had
rounded
up
her
white
lamb
and
yapped
upon
the
heels
of
those
who
dared
approach
with
too
great
familiarity
had
bristled
and
shown
her
teeth
upon
every
possible
occasion
until
those
who
would
fain
have
led
the
girl
into
new
and
verdant
pastures
had
fled
at
the
approach
leaving
them
both
to
enjoy
the
novelty
of
everything
each
after
her
own
kind
damaris
revelled
in
it
all
the
seagulls
the
lighthouses
the
ships
that
passed
in
the
day
and
night
and
the
of
a
storm
they
hit
up
in
the
bay
whilst
jane
coop
invented
new
verses
to
the
litany
as
she
tried
in
her
cabin
to
solve
the
problem
of
two
into
one
and
wellington
somewhere
under
the
daily
gave
a
fine
imitation
of
to
a
circle
of
admiring
seamen
to
his
last
hour
at
sea
captain
x
will
forever
retain
the
memory
of
what
it
cost
him
in
strength
of
will
to
maintain
his
dignity
when
standing
straight
and
exceedingly
beautiful
with
one
hand
full
of
lists
the
huge
bulldog
at
her
feet
with
a
black
bow
under
his
left
ear
and
an
assembly
of
the
greatest
sufferers
before
her
damaris
two
days
before
arriving
at
port
said
solemnly
read
out
the

at

the
speechless
captain
here
intimated
by
signs
that
the
culprit
should
stand
up
and
the
brindle
of
rodney
stone
strain
stood
whilst
the
men
eyes
glistened
as
they
fidgeted
upon
their
feet
from
very
joy
in
the
spectacle
his
skull
was
massive
and
the
square
and
strong
thrust
up
and
beyond
the
upper
the
teeth
were
perfect
even
large
and
also
strong
the
nose
was
black
and
large
well
back
between
the
eyes
which
were
set
low
down
and
wide
apart
but
well
in
front
and
round
with
a
deep
stop
between
them
the
honestest
outward
sign
of
his
gallant
loving
heart
the
ears
were
rose
not
in
colour
of
course
but
of
shape
set
high
and
small
and
fine
the
face
was
the
chop
well
down
and
the
loose
skin
in
abundant
folds
about
his
throat
and
neck
the
chest
was
wide
and
deep
and
prominent
the
shoulders
were
tremendously
muscular
the
body
was
short
with
a
roach
back
fine
in
the
rear
the
forelegs
short
and
strong
with
the
developed
calves
which
give
them
the
appearance
of
being
bowed
whereas
the
bones
are
really
straight
the
feet
turned
out
a
bit
with
toes
split
up
and
arched
the
tail
set
low
and
straight
down
and
anything
but
a
glad
tail
his
heart
was
of
the
finest
honest
loving
courageous
capable
of
hurling
its
owner
to
instant
battle
or
death
in
defence
of
the
one
loved
at
other
times
rendering
him
in
its
gentleness
an
almost
ludicrous
spectacle
of
adoration
of
such
was
wellington
and
if
the
description
is
somewhat
detailed
and
technical
it
is
because
he
happens
a
good
deal
into
the
book
the
duchess
had
been
put
into
the
train
for
port
said
by
ben
kelham
who
inwardly
kicking
at
her
sage
advice
looked
as
despondent
as
a
camel
who
considers
its
strength
unequal
to
its
burden
cheer
up
lad
she
cried
as
the
train
moved
off
cheer
up
something
is
sure
to
happen
before
long
which
was
a
perfectly
safe
prophecy
to
make
where
damaris
was
concerned
arrived
at
port
said
she
put
off
in
a
boat
with
her
maid
and
her
parrot
and
found
her
godchild
who
did
not
expect
her
on
deck
entranced
with
all
she
saw
yes
of
course
port
said
is
a
sink
of
iniquity
and
a
place
of
odours
and
a
fold
for
native
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
also
a
centre
for
antiquities
made
in
birmingham
or
by
the
vendor
himself
in
the
hot
weather
and
a
market
for
things
which
should
not
be
sold
much
less
bought
in
fact
in
one
short
sentence
it
is
a
deal
of
cosmopolitan
all
the
same
you
need
not
buy
and
you
need
not
listen
nor
look
and
if
it
is
the
first
bit
of
the
orient
you
have
meet
with
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
well
it
is
the
east
and
jolly
exciting
and
interesting
too
damaris
rushed
at
the
old
lady
and
having
curtsied
to
her
gathered
her
up
in
her
strong
arms
and
hugged
her
tightly
just
as
captain
x
who
during
one
trip
had
had
the
duchess
as
passenger
and
therefore
loved
her
came
along
as
they
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
the
girl
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
two
maids
and
smiled
with
a
great
love
of
their
respective
mistresses
as
their
sole
bond
in
common
they
stood
otherwise
divided
staring
at
each
other
pleased
to
meet
you
again
volunteered
jane
offering
a
plump
hand
hoping
you
are
in
good
health
responded
maria
hobson
making
a
corner
in
as
she
just
touched
the
wellington
you
have
met
dekko
i
think
laughed
the
girl
woomph
grunted
the
dog
disdainfully
as
he
cocked
an
eye
at
the
bird
which
ruffled
its
feathers
spread
its
red
tail
and
looked
down
sideways
and
spitefully
for
a
long
moment
my
gawd
it
suddenly
shrieked
my
gawd
and
it
swung
about
and
rubbed
its
soft
grey
pate
against
its
outrageous
golden
perruque
then
hurled
itself
onto
the
shoulder
chapter
yet
we
trust
that
somehow
good
will
be
the
final
goal
of
tennyson
after
the
fight
in
the
bazaar
the
ducal
party
stayed
for
another
fortnight
in
cairo
during
which
time
damaris
saw
as
much
of
the
place
and
its
surroundings
as
she
could
in
fourteen
days
and
a
few
hours
out
of
each
of
the
fourteen
nights
whilst
her
godmother
played
bridge
or
poker
paid
and
received
visits
took
her
to
dances
and
parties
and
busied
her
fingers
in
the
tangled
threads
fate
had
tossed
into
her
lap
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
the
girl
should
be
ready
to
conduct
the
old
aristocrat
to
the
at
the
and
give
her
the
evening
other
than
that
her
time
was
her
own
though
owing
to
her
innate
courtesy
and
her
love
for
her
godmother
she
never
once
absented
herself
without
having
obtained
permission
you
are
a
positive
tonic
child
in
these
perplexing
days
remarked
her
grace
when
the
girl
had
concluded
the
recital
of
the
fight
in
the
bazaar
only
do
remember
to
come
straight
to
me
if
ever
you
get
into
a
real
scrape
and
that
night
the
old
lady
who
had
lost
heavily
at
poker
fairly
snapped
at
maria
hobson
who
tucking
her
up
in
bed
remarked
greatly
daring
upon
the
amount
of
liberty
allowed
the
child
do
be
foolish
my
good
woman
she
said
and
do
for
goodness
sake
mind
your
business
of
looking
after
me
although
my
may
bluff
a
bit
for
the
fun
of
the
game
and
get
let
down
a
bit
for
her
own
good
yet
i
should
advise
anyone
to
get
seeing
her
too
often
fate
dealt
her
a
royal
straight
flush
in
hearts
and
better
that
you
ca
no
not
even
if
you
hold
a
full
house
of
intrigue
and
bad
intent
end
of
life
table
humff
replied
the
maid
heavily
through
her
nose
not
having
understood
one
word
of
her
mistress
admonition
each
day
at
breakfast
and
at
dinner
a
bunch
big
or
little
of
simple
or
hothouse
flowers
lay
beside
the
girl
plate
without
name
or
message
now
the
finding
of
flowers
upon
your
table
does
not
in
egypt
necessarily
imply
that
the
donor
thereof
is
a
son
of
the
desert
the
maître
has
been
known
to
do
it
out
of
deference
to
your
rank
or
purse
and
only
once
had
jane
coop
had
the
mixed
pleasure
of
meeting
the
nubian
who
daily
left
the
posies
at
the
hotel
refreshed
from
her
siesta
she
had
descended
to
the
hall
the
stairs
instead
of
the
lift
and
bumped
into
the
slave
as
he
bent
to
lay
a
sheaf
of
flowers
upon
the
matting
outside
her
door
he
had
straightened
himself
and
salaamed
almost
to
the
ground
which
had
delighted
jane
coop
and
had
offered
the
bunch
to
her
oh
no
my
man
she
had
said
bridling
you
do
come
over
me
that
way
just
you
take
that
trash
back
to
where
it
came
from
my
young
lady
ai
that
kind
and
had
shaken
her
fist
in
his
face
and
flounced
downstairs
to
lay
a
complaint
what
with
the
militant
maids
the
parrot
and
the
dog
the
ducal
party
was
continually
breaking
out
in
some
direction
or
another
but
the
maître
who
simply
worshipped
the
old
lady
merely
smiled
and
poured
the
oil
of
soothing
words
upon
the
troubled
waters
the
girl
had
quite
casually
recounted
the
fight
in
the
bazaar
and
the
wise
old
woman
had
made
no
comment
but
all
the
same
next
day
she
indifferently
asked
a
few
questions
of
lady
thistleton
who
had
a
big
heart
narrow
mind
an
tongue
and
two
daughters
oh
that
the
son
of
the
arab
and
the
english
girl
you
must
remember
the
fuse
there
was
in
england
over
the
runaway
marriage
what
was
her
name
how
she
could
you
know
ah
yes
you
must
be
talking
of
jill
carden
i
knew
her
very
well
naughty
girl
she
refused
the
invitation
i
sent
them
asking
them
to
come
to
england
and
stay
with
me
and
gave
up
writing
to
me
after
a
while
does
she
live
in
cairo
it
seemed
that
jill
the
wife
of
the
sheikh
lived
in
the
flat
oasis
side
of
the
canal
in
arabia
proper
but
according
to
current
gossip
was
at
the
moment
upon
a
visit
to
her
son
at
the
house
mahabbha
which
had
been
built
for
the
elder
branch
of
the
house
on
a
verdant
patch
watered
by
the
springs
from
the
limestone
hills
which
stretch
on
the
desert
side
of
the
oasis
of
khargegh
he
not
in
cairo
then
no
he
left
replied
the
gossip
you
see
his
mother
is
expected
any
time
at
his
home
if
she
is
already
there
my
maid
will
chatter
so
there
absolutely
no
stopping
her
funnily
enough
i
arrived
at
the
station
as
he
was
leaving
in
a
special
train
such
a
handsome
man
educated
in
england
millionaire
too
of
course
it
a
case
of
a
touch
of
the
tarbrush
such
a
pity
too
the
duchess
suddenly
shivered
little
jill
she
said
gently
little
jill
i
must
go
and
see
her
if
she
will
let
me
ah
general
what
about
a
hand
at
écarté
before
dinner
and
she
rose
with
a
stormy
rustling
of
her
silks
leaving
the
gossip
wondering
in
what
way
she
had
put
her
foot
in
it
that
night
as
she
lay
like
a
little
brown
mouse
under
the
watching
the
stars
through
the
open
window
the
old
lady
suddenly
decided
to
bestir
herself
it
too
risky
she
too
beautiful
too
young
and
unsophisticated
she
murmured
as
she
lit
a
cigarette
under
the
curtains
which
is
strictly
against
the
rules
i
bet
my
last
that
jill
carden
son
all
right
but
all
the
same
one
has
to
reckon
with
the
glamour
of
the
east
love
all
very
well
in
a
cool
climate
but
the
dickens
out
here
must
get
her
anchored
in
safe
waters
what
think
dekko
old
friend
what
course
shall
i
set
shall
we
go
home
or
to
heliopolis
the
bird
scrambled
awkwardly
on
to
the
well
old
man
how
about
it
steer
a
straight
course
for
hell
old
dear
came
the
muffled
reply
as
the
bird
twisted
its
head
under
its
wing
then
untucked
it
to
murmur
sleepily
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
move
on
the
very
day
after
the
birthday
which
fell
in
a
fortnights
time
she
would
indeed
have
left
at
once
if
it
had
not
been
that
she
had
issued
invitations
on
a
gigantic
scale
for
a
ball
in
honour
of
the
anniversary
inwardly
damaris
rebelled
at
the
suggestion
of
moving
on
to
heliopolis
outwardly
she
acquiesced
without
enthusiasm
but
if
it
will
do
that
nasty
little
cough
good
dearest
why
wait
for
the
ball
do
you
want
to
go
maris
the
desert
will
be
so
near
evaded
the
girl
ride
at
the
most
so
so
ben
kelham
told
me
and
there
you
see
the
desert
miles
upon
miles
of
it
stretching
right
away
like
the
sea
the
flashed
across
the
girl
face
taking
in
the
forced
indifference
of
the
expression
and
the
light
which
gleamed
far
down
in
the
eyes
i
had
a
letter
from
ben
this
morning
his
lung
has
been
troubling
him
that
is
why
he
has
been
over
did
you
has
it
is
it
rather
lamely
replied
the
girl
he
had
written
damaris
a
perfunctory
note
of
welcome
to
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
then
a
week
later
had
come
over
to
dine
he
had
ached
to
take
his
beautiful
little
chum
up
in
his
arms
and
shake
her
for
her
haughtiness
and
by
sheer
strength
of
arms
and
will
force
her
to
say
yes
to
the
question
which
it
took
him
all
his
strength
not
to
ask
since
childhood
he
had
been
her
slave
her
and
the
butt
of
her
various
moods
feeling
infinitely
well
rewarded
by
a
careless
smile
or
word
so
that
he
found
it
difficult
in
fact
impossible
to
act
up
to
her
grace
plans
and
suddenly
transpose
himself
into
the
strong
silent
man
the
girl
spoilt
and
accustomed
to
slavish
devotion
and
used
to
his
worship
felt
incensed
then
hurt
and
finally
perplexed
and
to
hide
it
all
retired
therewith
into
a
shell
of
icy
reserve
he
had
adored
her
openly
and
now
seemingly
looked
upon
her
as
just
one
of
the
crowd
of
women
in
the
hotel
she
had
taken
his
adoration
for
granted
and
as
a
right
to
waken
one
morning
to
find
the
gem
she
had
tossed
in
amongst
the
rubbish
of
her
little
experiences
gone
is
there
a
greater
mistake
in
the
world
than
that
of
looking
upon
love
as
an
ordinary
possession
instead
of
as
a
rare
jewel
they
were
both
very
young
so
that
they
suffered
the
agonies
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
whilst
the
old
dame
smiled
up
her
sleeve
from
the
hour
of
the
early
cup
of
tea
until
on
the
morning
of
the
ball
which
was
also
the
girl
birthday
morning
tarbusched
impudent
young
monkeys
of
messenger
boys
bearing
gifts
and
flowers
arrived
in
a
stream
at
the
hotel
flowers
in
pots
and
vases
and
bunches
lay
everywhere
in
the
suite
shawls
of
many
colours
silken
veils
slippers
albums
of
views
of
egypt
rare
antiques
made
mostly
in
birmingham
one
mummied
cat
genuine
scarabs
suspicious
and
one
live
gazelle
littered
the
place
ben
kelham
had
bought
her
a
ring
of
dull
gold
through
it
he
had
forced
some
flowers
and
sent
it
along
she
held
it
tight
in
her
hand
for
a
moment
then
deliberately
and
ostentatiously
laid
it
amongst
the
clutter
on
the
table
whilst
her
grace
peeped
from
behind
the
newspaper
which
she
was
reading
in
bed
arrived
at
the
table
in
the
the
girl
suddenly
flushed
pink
and
then
went
quite
white
right
in
the
centre
flanked
on
one
side
by
the
glass
dish
of
glowing
fruit
and
the
other
by
a
jar
of
keiller
marmalade
stood
a
cage
tied
at
the
top
with
silver
ribbon
and
containing
two
cooing
doves
the
doves
were
just
ordinary
ones
but
their
prison
was
no
ordinary
cage
and
square
it
was
made
of
fine
white
bars
of
ivory
the
underside
was
also
ivory
square
and
unblemished
and
would
have
made
an
ideal
it
stood
upon
ebony
feet
inlaid
with
infinitesimal
precious
stones
it
has
but
just
arrived
miss
hethencourt
said
the
maître
who
had
been
fluttering
around
upon
the
tiptoe
of
a
most
unusual
curiosity
there
is
no
name
no
message
please
send
it
to
my
room
she
replied
indifferently
whilst
for
some
unaccountable
reason
her
heart
throbbed
as
she
responded
to
the
birthday
greetings
which
came
from
every
corner
of
the
room
chapter
vi
mother
is
a
mother
still
the
holiest
thing
coleridge
may
the
blessing
of
allah
who
is
god
be
upon
thee
o
woman
the
sonorous
words
of
the
benediction
rang
through
the
room
as
hugh
carden
ali
stood
with
the
silken
curtain
drawn
back
in
one
hand
and
the
right
raised
in
blessing
upon
his
mother
who
stood
with
arms
outstretched
in
the
centre
of
the
room
then
he
knelt
to
receive
the
benison
of
the
woman
he
loved
smiled
when
he
felt
the
small
hands
upon
his
head
and
leaping
to
his
feet
swung
her
up
into
his
arms
covering
her
face
with
kisses
you
beautiful
darling
he
said
as
he
crushed
her
up
to
the
derangement
of
her
perfumed
silks
and
satins
and
many
jewels
just
heavenly
coming
back
to
you
you
dear
understanding
mother
the
woman
heart
leapt
to
battle
for
in
the
last
words
in
the
way
her
beloved
son
looked
down
upon
her
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
she
knew
that
somewhere
out
in
the
world
he
had
received
a
hurt
she
knew
so
little
of
him
had
only
had
him
for
such
a
little
little
while
under
the
influence
of
her
love
and
in
the
shelter
of
her
heart
and
she
loved
him
her
firstborn
with
a
love
beyond
words
thinking
to
do
the
best
for
him
and
making
the
biggest
mistake
of
all
beating
down
her
beloved
husband
opposition
she
had
sent
the
boy
to
england
and
in
the
subsequent
eight
years
had
only
seen
him
twice
he
is
of
the
east
woman
of
my
heart
behold
i
have
studied
him
had
said
the
sheikh
all
those
years
ago
let
him
be
else
evil
may
befall
him
but
jill
his
beautiful
wife
had
insisted
and
his
love
for
her
being
beyond
telling
the
great
arab
had
submitted
to
her
wish
for
so
it
had
been
written
and
what
can
be
the
outcome
of
the
tragic
mixing
of
blood
nothing
but
pain
come
to
the
roof
and
talk
mother
under
the
stars
so
up
the
marble
staircase
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
to
the
roof
they
went
where
the
silken
awnings
lay
folded
and
the
scented
white
flowers
hung
asleep
they
stood
under
the
canopy
of
purple
night
studded
with
flashing
silvery
points
as
the
soft
winds
carried
to
them
the
notes
of
a
guitar
softly
thrummed
in
the
shade
of
the
palms
it
is
mary
dear
happily
whispered
the
woman
she
came
with
me
to
welcome
you
and
then
she
clasped
her
hands
at
the
blaze
of
anger
which
swept
the
man
face
most
gracious
mother
i
am
master
of
my
house
and
save
for
your
presence
i
can
not
have
woman
set
foot
in
it
without
my
consent
when
i
have
the
desire
for
one
as
wife
plaything
or
servant
then
i
will
give
orders
but
hugh
mary
is
your
sister
mary
is
my
sister
and
i
do
not
deem
it
wise
or
seemly
that
she
should
run
about
the
country
at
her
own
wish
or
whim
but
hugh
dear
let
me
speak
i
saw
so
much
of
woman
in
europe
that
the
yashmak
the
barku
the
seclusion
and
modesty
of
the
east
have
become
dear
to
me
above
all
else
have
you
forgotten
dear
the
restaurants
the
theatres
the
parks
and
allah
the
streets
the
bodies
the
craving
for
excitement
the
wine
the
nights
turned
into
day
why
one
has
but
to
stretch
the
hand
for
flowers
to
be
laid
therein
the
feet
trip
at
every
step
with
the
trap
of
woman
hair
the
quarry
stands
waiting
for
the
arrow
there
is
not
even
the
incentive
of
the
chase
the
hot
pursuit
the
lust
of
the
kill
i
speak
as
my
father
son
and
in
my
house
i
will
have
privacy
and
seclusion
and
seemliness
women
shall
be
brought
to
me
when
i
desire
their
presence
and
the
steeliness
of
the
voice
brought
the
woman
as
he
gave
her
an
order
cloaked
in
the
guise
of
a
favour
begged
and
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
ask
my
sister
to
keep
within
the
women
quarters
until
i
send
for
her
but
and
she
ripped
the
corner
of
her
veil
between
perturbed
fingers
when
upon
the
clapping
of
hands
a
slave
ran
swiftly
to
learn
his
pleasure
then
hastened
away
to
find
the
head
of
the
guesthouse
assigned
to
after
which
the
sweet
thrumming
of
the
guitar
instantly
stopped
on
more
than
one
night
they
talked
under
the
stars
sitting
on
satin
cushions
or
leaning
on
the
marble
of
the
balustrade
looking
due
east
to
where
so
many
miles
away
flows
the
nile
as
it
has
flowed
through
the
centuries
all
unheeding
of
the
passing
of
mighty
kingdoms
and
yet
had
the
mother
learned
nothing
of
the
hurt
reflected
in
her
firstborn
eyes
most
precious
mother
he
was
saying
as
he
stood
flicking
the
pages
of
the
latest
illustrated
paper
just
arrived
from
cairo
but
which
was
really
a
volume
of
the
book
of
life
written
printed
and
published
by
fate
if
it
pleases
you
to
stay
when
i
am
gone
will
you
do
so
just
as
long
as
you
find
happiness
in
my
dwelling
you
are
going
hugh
so
soon
for
long
there
has
come
a
report
of
lion
in
the
nubian
desert
as
far
north
as
deir
i
can
hardly
believe
it
for
it
is
years
and
years
since
a
lion
has
been
seen
even
in
the
khor
baraka
however
a
runner
from
nubia
came
in
this
morning
so
there
may
be
something
in
it
god
grant
it
for
the
sport
and
the
danger
would
be
great
killing
or
being
killed
in
the
rocks
and
ruins
of
the
temple
also
i
could
visit
my
tents
of
purple
and
of
gold
how
long
shall
i
be
gone
sweet
mother
that
is
known
only
to
allah
to
whom
our
goings
and
our
comings
are
as
the
drifting
of
the
sands
your
tents
are
very
beautiful
my
son
the
servants
are
waiting
for
your
orders
before
pitching
the
the
middle
one
without
asking
permission
i
went
to
inspect
them
just
before
your
return
just
to
see
if
everything
was
quite
all
right
one
can
never
quite
trust
the
servants
jill
might
have
been
sitting
on
a
rectory
lawn
talking
about
her
or
with
a
neighbour
instead
of
one
of
the
wonders
of
modern
egypt
in
fact
so
quaint
was
it
that
the
man
laughed
and
swung
her
onto
the
balustrade
i
not
surprised
father
worships
the
ground
your
ridiculous
little
feet
tread
on
mater
he
said
causing
his
mother
to
gasp
so
english
did
he
sound
so
oriental
did
he
look
dear
she
said
gently
as
she
scrutinised
him
with
a
mother
eyes
and
touched
his
face
and
patted
his
cheek
and
pulled
a
bit
here
and
there
at
his
fine
white
linen
coat
upon
which
in
coarse
thread
was
embroidered
the
hawk
of
old
egypt
dear
do
you
think
you
would
be
happier
if
you
were
to
marry
and
settle
down
and
it
was
then
that
there
came
to
her
the
full
explanation
of
the
hurt
reflected
in
her
firstborn
eyes
i
shall
never
marry
dear
very
gently
replied
the
man
so
fearful
was
he
of
causing
pain
to
the
woman
who
had
borne
him
i
i
you
see
i
can
not
can
not
hugh
but
my
dear
what
is
the
matter
you
will
have
to
some
day
you
know
you
are
your
father
eldest
son
answered
the
woman
who
wrapped
in
perfect
love
and
happiness
had
never
given
a
thought
to
the
effects
of
her
marriage
with
the
arabian
dear
son
there
are
so
many
beautiful
cultured
gentle
women
here
and
at
home
i
mean
in
england
you
mother
please
oh
mother
you
do
understand
dear
heavens
you
do
understand
listen
and
how
i
wish
my
father
whom
i
honour
were
here
to
comfort
you
forgive
me
dear
forgive
me
for
the
pain
i
must
cause
you
and
the
woman
went
white
to
the
lips
under
a
sudden
blinding
flash
of
understanding
and
her
proud
eyes
dropped
to
the
hands
clenched
in
her
lap
i
want
to
marry
mother
of
mine
he
spoke
in
the
arabian
tongue
which
is
so
atune
to
love
for
behold
love
in
the
space
of
an
hour
has
grown
within
me
the
floods
of
love
drown
me
the
trees
of
passion
throw
their
shade
upon
the
surging
waters
and
behold
the
shade
is
that
of
tenderness
from
the
midst
of
the
flood
where
i
am
like
to
drown
i
stretch
my
arms
towards
the
rocky
shore
where
stands
looking
towards
me
the
desire
of
my
soul
behold
my
eyes
have
seen
her
and
behold
she
is
white
with
hair
like
the
desert
at
sunset
and
eyes
even
as
the
pools
of
lebanon
she
is
as
a
rod
to
be
bent
and
as
a
vase
of
perfume
to
be
broken
upon
a
night
of
love
and
i
love
her
her
out
of
all
women
a
doe
to
be
hunted
at
dawn
a
mare
to
be
spurred
through
the
watches
of
the
night
hugh
i
love
her
as
my
father
loved
you
my
father
of
whom
i
am
the
eldest
son
son
of
a
highborn
father
son
of
a
highborn
mother
outcast
outcast
for
pity
sake
hugh
stop
but
the
storm
swept
on
tearing
the
veil
from
the
woman
eyes
behold
i
care
not
for
the
plucking
of
garden
blossoms
therefore
are
the
beautiful
docile
women
of
the
east
not
for
me
and
the
thorns
upon
the
hedge
of
convention
defied
the
barbed
wires
of
racial
distinction
keep
me
from
the
hedgerow
flower
born
of
the
wind
and
the
sky
and
the
summer
heat
which
i
covet
among
men
i
am
nothing
i
may
not
claim
equality
with
the
scavenger
of
the
western
streets
or
with
the
of
the
eastern
bazaar
here
i
am
served
with
fear
and
servility
being
a
man
of
riches
across
the
waters
i
may
sun
myself
in
the
smiles
of
women
as
long
as
i
have
no
desire
to
he
suddenly
seized
the
woman
holding
her
in
a
grip
of
iron
which
left
great
bruises
on
her
arms
do
you
know
what
she
called
me
mother
that
harlot
of
a
line
of
noblemen
what
she
flung
in
my
teeth
because
seeing
in
her
a
woman
of
the
streets
hidden
under
the
cloak
of
marriage
i
refused
to
be
tempted
there
fell
a
terrible
silence
and
then
a
few
whispered
words
she
called
me
a
mother
me
a
and
the
mother
fell
at
her
son
feet
and
bowed
her
head
to
the
ground
and
he
swept
her
up
into
his
arms
raining
kisses
upon
the
piteous
face
i
do
blame
you
he
said
in
english
whilst
she
sobbed
on
his
heart
am
i
not
the
fruit
of
a
brave
woman
great
love
could
there
be
anything
finer
than
that
but
my
father
in
me
made
my
whole
body
clamour
for
the
desert
when
i
was
in
england
my
mother
in
me
makes
my
heart
throb
in
the
desert
for
just
one
hour
of
her
cool
misty
country
one
hour
on
a
in
which
to
watch
the
dawn
dearest
dearest
do
sob
so
it
is
a
case
of
two
affirmatives
making
a
negative
two
great
nationalities
decried
derided
rendered
null
and
void
in
their
offspring
through
the
dictates
of
those
who
in
religion
prate
that
we
are
all
brothers
i
have
just
got
to
stick
it
my
mother
and
life
is
not
very
long
but
i
shall
never
marry
and
as
he
spoke
fate
flicked
a
page
of
an
illustrated
paper
which
was
but
the
volume
of
the
book
of
life
and
perhaps
only
a
mother
eyes
would
have
noticed
the
sudden
tightening
of
the
hand
upon
the
marble
of
the
balustrade
as
the
man
looked
down
into
the
pictured
beauty
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
having
read
what
had
been
written
he
knelt
to
receive
his
mother
blessing
to
the
tents
of
purple
and
gold
my
darling
she
asked
smiling
so
bravely
to
hide
her
breaking
heart
not
just
yet
dear
a
bit
further
north
first
i
think
for
long
i
do
not
know
dear
bless
me
o
my
mother
she
blessed
him
and
called
to
him
as
he
stood
at
the
head
of
the
marble
stairway
come
back
to
me
my
son
that
o
woman
is
in
the
hands
of
allah
who
is
god
and
he
turned
and
left
her
and
she
having
wept
her
heart
out
and
her
beautiful
eyes
dim
took
up
the
illustrated
paper
which
was
a
volume
of
the
book
of
life
and
turned
the
pages
ah
she
said
how
beautiful
it
was
just
a
simple
photograph
of
damaris
at
a
tennis
tournament
and
underneath
the
information
that
the
most
popular
and
beautiful
visitor
in
cairo
would
celebrate
her
birthday
in
a
week
time
that
in
honour
of
the
occasion
her
the
duchess
of
longacres
had
issued
invitations
for
a
ball
after
which
social
event
she
and
her
would
proceed
to
the
desert
palace
hotel
heliopolis
i
wonder
whispered
jill
i
wonder
if
she
would
come
to
see
me
she
was
always
such
a
wise
old
woman
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
way
out
and
she
stretched
her
arms
out
towards
the
desert
hahmed
she
called
beloved
i
love
you
and
my
heart
is
breaking
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
many
horses
running
then
bowed
her
head
and
wept
the
dawn
was
nigh
to
breaking
and
yet
the
parade
of
horses
was
not
finished
whilst
the
trainer
the
head
groom
the
stud
groom
the
and
the
rank
and
file
of
the
stables
tore
their
beards
or
their
hair
as
they
endeavoured
to
please
their
master
whilst
they
waited
anxiously
for
the
return
of
the
man
who
had
been
hurriedly
sent
to
fetch
in
the
mare
who
was
out
to
grass
and
as
wild
as
a
bird
on
the
wing
singly
or
in
pairs
every
priceless
quadruped
had
been
put
through
its
paces
upon
the
track
of
tan
imported
from
england
three
stallions
brothers
to
even
then
in
cairo
and
famous
throughout
egypt
tore
past
him
like
a
cyclone
and
left
him
indifferent
a
chestnut
brood
mare
whose
price
was
above
that
of
many
rubies
trotted
up
at
his
call
and
snuffled
a
welcome
in
his
sleeve
searched
for
sugar
in
his
hand
and
found
it
and
whinnied
gently
when
he
turned
away
bays
piebalds
roans
greys
trotted
galloped
jumped
whilst
their
master
smoked
endless
cigarettes
and
the
stud
groom
prayed
fervently
to
allah
by
the
patience
of
the
prophet
the
master
suddenly
cried
turning
on
the
man
hast
thou
nothing
else
is
there
no
jewel
amongst
my
horses
hast
thou
not
in
all
my
stables

of

found

mare
alia
has
she
been
perchance
as
sterile
as
thy
wits
and
then
he
stopped
short
and
stood
in
silence
watching
the
loveliest
picture
any
human
could
wish
to
see
picking
up
her
dainty
feet
as
though
she
walked
upon
hot
stones
tossing
her
proud
little
head
with
big
gentle
eyes
spreading
nostrils
and
fine
small
ears
almost
touching
at
the
tips
mane
flowing
tail
set
high
and
spread
came
the
mare
allah
but
the
loveliness
of
that
picture
as
she
stood
thoroughbred
perfect
as
proud
as
any
queen
as
scornful
as
any
spoiled
beauty
as
confused
at
the
sight
of
her
master
as
any
bride
ten
yards
away
and
motionless
she
stood
from
this
man
who
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
her
and
then
she
wheeled
and
flung
up
her
heels
then
stopped
and
looked
at
him
along
her
satin
flank
and
piqued
with
his
indifference
suddenly
sped
out
into
the
desert
then
softly
melodiously
the
man
voice
called
her
ringing
like
a
bell
under
the
lightening
sky
and
behold
love
awoke
in
the
heart
and
she
turned
and
raced
back
towards
him
longing
for
his
hand
and
the
grip
of
his
knees
upon
her
but
with
her
feet
upon
the
tan
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
and
danced
across
towards
the
stallions
causing
their
grooms
to
hold
on
to
them
with
both
hands
then
she
came
back
to
circle
round
about
this
man
who
seemingly
took
no
notice
of
her
vagaries
not
even
when
she
reared
just
behind
him
pawing
the
air
nor
when
she
lashed
out
at
a
humble
missing
him
by
a
hair
until
at
last
overpowered
by
curiosity
and
love
curveting
rearing
throwing
her
feet
and
making
a
frightful
over
nothing
at
all
she
came
close
up
oh
very
close
and
whinnied
gently
with
one
hand
clutching
the
silvery
mane
and
in
one
bound
he
was
across
the
bare
back
and
away
with
her
into
the
desert
gripping
her
with
his
knees
calling
to
her
by
every
he
could
think
of
and
out
there
alone
in
the
desert
at
the
hour
of
prayer
he
slipped
from
her
and
turning
towards
mecca
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
o
god
of
the
west
o
allah
of
the
east
give
me
one
single
hour
of
love
and
the
mare
wonderful
in
her
beauty
raced
from
him
far
out
into
the
desert
leaving
him
alone
with
his
god
then
stood
quite
still
with
fine
small
ears
pricked
waiting
for
the
call
she
knew
would
come
and
when
it
came
ringing
clear
over
the
golden
sand
she
raced
back
to
him
and
pushed
against
him
until
he
sprang
upon
her
and
turned
her
towards
the
east
the
he
cried
quoting
from
run
swiftly
to
battle
with
a
panting
noise
and
by
those
who
strike
fire
by
dashing
their
hoofs
against
the
stones
and
by
those
who
make
a
sudden
invasion
on
the
enemy
early
in
the
morning
and
therein
raise
the
dust
and
therein
pass
through
the
midst
of
the
adverse
by
the
message
of
the
great
book
and
by
my
love
will
i
wrest
one
hour
from
life
and
urging
the
mare
with
the
whip
of
love
to
the
uttermost
of
her
wonderful
speed
he
thundered
back
across
the
path
of
sand
which
was
to
be
trodden
by
his
feet
alone
in
spite
of
the
plots
which
zulannah
the
courtesan
was
even
then
weaving
about
him
to
her
own
advancement
chapter
vii
and
she
painted
her
face
and
tired
her
head
and
looked
out
at
a
ii
kings
the
house
of
the
scarlet
enchantress
with
its
balconies
turrets
and
outer
and
inner
courts
stood
quite
by
itself
at
one
corner
of
the
square
in
a
big
neglected
garden
it
had
been
built
by
means
of
untold
gold
and
the
destruction
of
scores
of
miserable
picturesque
hovels
which
poor
as
they
might
be
had
however
meant
home
to
many
of
the
needy
in
the
arabian
quarters
of
cairo
it
would
be
useless
to
look
for
that
building
covered
in
white
plaster
now
it
was
later
looted
and
burned
to
the
ground
a
beautiful
wanton
of
fourteen
summers
ambitious
relentless
with
the
eyes
of
an
innocent
child
the
morals
of
a
jackal
and
a
fair
supply
of
rather
than
intellect
zulannah
sat
this
night
of
stars
in
a
corner
of
her
balcony
overlooking
the
square
smoking
endless
cigarettes
courtesan
of
the
highest
rank
she
had
plied
her
ruthless
trade
for
three
successful
years
accumulating
incredible
wealth
in
jewels
and
hard
cash
her
ambition
knew
no
bounds
her
greed
no
limit
her
jealousy
of
other
women
had
become
a
in
the
north
physically
she
was
perfect
otherwise
she
had
not
one
saving
grace
and
her
enemies
were
legion
she
had
driven
hard
bargains
demanding
the
very
rings
off
men
fingers
in
exchange
for
kisses
shutting
the
door
with
callous
finality
in
the
face
of
those
she
had
beggared
she
had
disowned
her
mother
who
stricken
with
ophthalmia
begged
in
the
streets
she
had
no
mercy
for
man
woman
or
beast
yet
all
had
gone
well
until
love
had
come
to
her
love
comes
to
harlots
and
to
queens
as
well
as
to
us
ordinary
women
and
they
suffer
every
whit
as
much
as
we
do
perhaps
more
keenly
on
account
of
the
hopeless
positions
they
fill
it
had
come
to
zulannah
uncontrollably
that
night
when
unveiled
garbed
in
silks
and
satins
and
hung
with
jewels
she
brazenly
graced
the
at
a
gala
performance
she
looked
down
and
ben
kelham
in
the
end
seat
of
the
first
row
of
stalls
looked
up
and
looked
and
looked
seeing
nothing
being
blinded
with
love
of
damaris
zulannah
drove
back
in
her
to
the
edge
of
the
arabian
quarter
where
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
lanes
called
by
courtesy
streets
she
alighted
to
finish
what
remained
of
the
journey
in
a
litter
swung
from
the
shoulders
of
four
nubian
slaves
and
arrived
at
the
great
house
summoned
her
special
bodyguard
qatim
the
ethiopian
and
for
acquiring
information
down
to
the
smallest
detail
about
some
special
individual
there
is
surely
no
detective
agency
on
earth
to
compare
to
one
ordinary
native
servant
he
loves
intrigue
so
that
hours
later
zulannah
laughed
shrilly
when
qatim
the
ethiopian
repeated
all
he
had
learned
of
the
white
man
and
the
white
maid
he
presumably
loved
love
she
scoffed
he
has
not
met
but
in
the
weeks
that
followed
no
plot
had
succeeded
no
device
or
subtle
invitation
had
lured
the
bird
to
the
list
so
that
she
beat
sharply
upon
a
silver
gong
this
night
of
the
stars
upon
which
the
ethiopian
came
running
hastily
to
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
at
the
jewelled
henna
feet
get
up
she
said
kicking
him
upon
the
side
of
the
head
whereupon
he
rose
chalking
up
one
more
mark
on
his
own
particular
slate
of
life
upon
one
side
of
which
was
written
desire
and
the
other
revenge
he
stood
in
his
as
black
and
glistening
as
a
polished
ebony
statue
the
enormous
hands
at
the
end
of
great
arms
almost
touched
his
knees
the
chest
and
shoulders
and
abdomen
were
hard
as
iron
rippling
with
muscle
under
the
oiled
skin
the
feet
were
huge
and
pink
of
sole
and
the
animality
of
the
man
was
intensified
by
a
certain
gleam
of
intelligence
somewhere
in
the
impassive
negroid
face
the
woman
took
no
notice
of
the
magnificent
physique
it
neither
repulsed
nor
attracted
her
he
was
a
slave
run
and
give
orders
that
no
one
is
admitted
hasten

a
great
noble
waits
at

thou
thy
tongue
split
thou
black
dog
that
thou
answerest
zulannah
haste
thee
and
return
and
far
into
the
night
they
talked
those
two
planning
death
or
destruction
anything
as
long
as
it
attained
the
desire
of
the
woman
who
looking
into
the
future
took
no
notice
of
the
mountain
of
disaster
beside
her
in
the
shape
of
the
ethiopian
who
desired
and
hated
her
with
all
the
bestial
passion
of
his
race
then
just
as
far
down
in
the
east
the
sky
lightened
she
sat
suddenly
upright
and
clapped
her
jewelled
hands
thou
the
eunuch
who
guards
the
harem
empty
of
women
in
the
palace
of
ah
the
barbarity

who
perchance
would
give
nay
all
of
his
great
wealth
in

for
the
of
thy
odorous
skin
there
is
to
be
held
a
big
entertainment
within
the
walls
of
the
white
man
hotel
and
soon
an
entertainment
where
the
whites
dance
foolishly
in
foolish
raiment
disguised
as
that
which
they
are
not
and
with
covered
faces
what
easier
than
for
me
to
obtain
entry
as
one
of
them
under
my
veils
and
have
speech
with
the
man
i
love
and
if
he
is
as
thou
sayest
besotted
with
love
of
this
white
girl
then
will
i
use
the
man
of
barbarous
name
as
a
tool
to
bring
about
that
which
i
desire
thou
the
eunuch
mistress
he
is
my
twin
of
behold
did
not
thy
mother
die
of
fright
at

of
such
monstrosities
nay
mistress
there
are
six
sons
younger
than
thy
slave
each
one
of
which
could
break
thee
in
one
hand
zulannah
sprang
to
her
feet
and
seizing
a
short
whip
from
a
table
smote
the
man
again
and
again
until
his
face
ran
blood
thou
vile
brute
darest
thou
so
to
speak
behold
this
is
but
a
foretaste
of
what
will
befall

black
carcase

the
hour

split
my
tongue

the

from

bones
and
thou
shalt
never
meet
my
who
even
now
prepareth
the
great
palace
for
the
coming
of
the
he
spat
bird
of
plumage
and
zulannah
understanding
that
she
must
not
overstep
the
limit
if
she
desired
to
attain
her
end
flung
the
whip
full
into
the
stolid
indifferent
face
and
fled
raving
obscenities
into
the
house
chapter

in
his

brought
close
the
day
when
i
must
die

what
you
think
there
is
to
be
a
real
native
in
the
winter
garden
they
made
the
corner
near
the
fountain
like
an
arab
tent
and

our
horoscopes
in
the
sand
and
all
sorts
of
things
not
forgetting
the
stars
let
us
hope
oh
there
sure
to
be
that
damaris
laughed
as
she
turned
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
the
excited
little
visitor
in
you
look
sweet
a
light
of
the
harem
for
certain
yes
and
what
do
you
think
there
are
three
dozen
lights
is
it
a
shame
i
thought
i
should
be
the
only
one
and
there
are
two
and
a
half
dozen
sheikhs
and
i
do
know
how
many
dozen
bedouins
you
are
what
are
you
you
look
awfully
awfully
er
i
do
quite
know
what
damaris
adjusted
the
the
quaint
silver
kind
of
tube
between
the
eyebrows
which
connects
the
yashmak
and
the
or
took
a
final
look
in
the
mirror
and
rose
i
am
an
egyptian
woman
of
the
humblest
class
she
was
all
in
black
as
befits
a
member
of
that
class
the
simple
bodice
cut
in
a
yoke
of
the
black
muslin
dress
fitted
her
like
a
glove
the
skirt
fell
in
wide
folds
from
the
waist
and
swung
about
her
ankles
encircled
by
big
brass
rings
which
clashed
as
she
moved
she
wore
the
black
yashmak
and
upon
her
arms
were
many
brass
bracelets
which
tinkled
on
one
hand
she
wore
a
ring
and
there
were
silken
hose
and
sandals
upon
her
feet
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
henna
her
which
members
of
the
humblest
class
have
not
time
to
do
besides
their
patient
hands
matter
so
little
and
her
great
eyes
looked
as
black
as
the
yashmak
over
which
they
shone
her
beautiful
face
was
hidden
yet
was
she
infinitely
alluring
tantilising
mysterious
under
her
veils

if
only
women
knew
how
easy
it
is
to
enhance
the
looks
by
the
simple
method
of
touching
up
the
eyes
with
and
covering
the
rest
of
the
face
all
of
us
in
veils
and
masks
will
have
to
take
them
off

up

gargoyle
my

she
whispered

what
she
meant
gargoyle
do
come
along
the
girls
happy
laughter
rang
down
the
corridor
as
they
knocked
at
her
grace
door
she
stood
at
her
in
a
beautiful
dress
of
grey
brocade
diamonds
sparkled
in
the
laces
of
her
corsage
on
her
fingers
and
in
the
buckles
of
her
lovely
shoes
a
big
bunch
of
pink
carnations
was
tied
on
the
top
of
her
ebony
stick
a
priceless
lace
veil
fastened
over
her
head
by
a
fragile
wreath
of
diamond
leaves
fell
almost
to
the
hem
of
her
dress
behind
she
had
discarded
the
terrifying
perruque
and
her
own
hair
was
puffed
and
curled
about
the
little
face
which
was
finely
powdered
and
slightly
rouged
she
was
a
dream
of
beautiful
old
age
with
dekko
just
visible
under
a
huge
pink
bow
upon
her
shoulder
may
i
present
a
very
old
woman
to
youth
she
said
simply
darling
cried
damaris
as
she
ran
forward
and
pushing
the
yashmak
to
one
side
kissed
the
jewelled
hand
you
are
too
beautiful
too
beautiful
promise
me
never
never
never
to
wear
it
again
i
too
old
to
get
rid
of
bad
habits
chérie
said
her
godmother
and
we
had
better
go
down
by
the
way
what
is
ben
coming
as
i
really
do
know
came
the
muffled
reply
from
behind
the
yashmak
if
he
comes
at
all
as
cairo
entire
had
accepted
the
invitation
the
place
was
packed
but
nowhere
was
the
crowd
so
suffocating
as
round
the
entrance
to
the
winter
garden
wonderful
gasped
a
rotund
ouled
nail
to
a
masked
dancer
of
the
same
sex
and
size
he
told
me
about
that
terrible
time
when
i
lost
so
much
at
bridge
you
remember
dear
when
i
had
to
er
to
raise
money
on
my
diamonds
how
could
he
have
seen
it
in
my
hand
he
had
he
had
been
a
guest
at
hurdley
castle
with
her
what
he
like
oh
i
could
see
his
face
on
account
of
the
handkerchief
thing
but
i
think
he
quite
common
his
clothes
are
quite
poor
i
believe
he
is
one
of
the
waiters
dressed
up
i
seem
to
recognise
his
voice
have
you
long
to
wait
i
down
the
list
who
in
now
some
woman
in
black
there
are
four
of
them
and
i
ca
tell
from
which
the
hand
of
the
woman
who
was
down
the
list
was
never
told
damaris
lifted
the
curtain
and
walked
into
the
corner
of
the
winter
garden
which
had
been
temporarily
given
the
appearance
of
an
tent
she
said
gently
giving
the
word
of
peace
the
salaamed
with
hands
to
forehead
mouth
and
heart
in
the
beautiful
eastern
gesture
he
replied
as
gently
which
is
the
sacrament
of
lips
there
was
the
regulation
small
table
with
a
chart
of
the
stars
and
a
silver
tray
covered
in
sand
upon
it
on
either
side
was
a
chair
but
it
was
upon
a
cushion
on
the
floor
that
damaris
seated
herself
with
her
back
against
the
canvas
drapery
of
the
wall
motioning
the
arab
to
a
cushion
near
her
whilst
her
eyes
swept
the
loose
cotton
tunic
the
or
which
almost
completely
hid
the
face
the
great
white
mantle
and
the
sandals
upon
the
naked
feet
oh
the
game
of
they
played
those
two
with
the
dagger
of
love
between
them
there
fell
a
silence
and
then
the
spoke
in
his
own
tongue
and
too
absorbed
were
they
in
the
game
of
to
notice
that
he
made
use
of
neither
sand
nor
stars
nor
the
lines
upon
her
hands
which
were
clasped
above
her
heart
as
he
read
her
future
in
her
eyes
two
paths
lie
before
thee
o
woman
and
both
stretch
through
the
kingdom
of
love
the
one
to
thy
right
hand
has
been
marked
out
upon
the
field
of
content
by
feet
bound
in
the
sandals
of
custom
and
convention
there
is
shade
upon
this
path
for
behold
the
scorching
sun
of
passion
may
not
penetrate
the
leaves
of
the
trees
of
tranquillity
the
storm
breaks
not
neither
do
the
biting
winds
of
fear
nor
the
drenching
torrents
of
desire
encompass
those
who
walk
thereon
the
river
the
slow
river
of
patience
flows
ever
beside
it
on
its
way
to
the
ocean
of
life
in
which
all
waters
must
mingle
in
eternity
there
fell
a
silence
broken
by
the
swaying
throbbing
music
from
the
distant
causing
the
girl
suddenly
to
stretch
out
her
hands
upon
which
shone
the
ring
and
the
man
to
stretch
out
his
though
he
touched
not
hers
at
all
and
to
the
left
to
the
left
o
woman
whose
eyes
are
like
unto
the
pools
of
lebanon
at
night
to
thy
left
lies
the
desert
the
desert
where
the
feet
are
blistered
by
the
gritting
sands
of
passion
and
the
eyes
are
blinded
in
desire
the
vast
plain
where
knowledge
walks
with
death
where
the
footprints
of
horror
fear
starvation
thirst
which
are
but
the
footprints
of
jealousy
and
love
desired
and
fulfilled
mark
the
sands
for
one
little
second
and
then
are
gone
the
desert
where
there
is
no
shade
no
cool
waters
no
content
no
peace
until
the
wanderer
lies
still
with
sightless
eyes
turned
towards
eternity
and
if
a
woman
feet
trod
upon
it
then
will
she
cut
her
feet
upon
the
stones
of
pain
then
will
the
scorpion
of
bitter
experience
sting
her
heel
then
will
she
die
with
a
smile
upon
her
red
mouth
for
love
will
have
come
to
her
maybe
for
a
day
maybe
for
a
second
of
time
but
a
love
which
will
mingle
her
soul
with
the
soul
of
her
desert
lover
or
shatter
her
body
even
as
is
broken
the
alabaster
vase
of
sweet
perfume
yet
is
it
the
of
the
that
endureth
forever
yea
even
if
the
body
of
the
woman
passeth
unto
another
keeping
the
girl
pulled
her
veil
closely
about
her
head
and
sat
quite
still
her
wonderful
eyes
hidden
by
the
fringe
of
black
lashes
and
yet
did
she
not
move
when
he
sprang
to
his
feet
intoxicated
with
the
mystery
of
her
afire
with
that
love
which
is
the
heritage
of
the
desert
then
he
bent
and
caught
her
by
the
wrists
and
raised
her
to
her
feet
take
the
path
at
thy
right
hand
woman
set
not
a
foot
upon
the
desert
sand
lest
perchance
a
bird
of
prey
swoop
down
upon
thee
thou
white
dove
he
pulled
her
hands
up
holding
them
cruelly
as
in
a
steel
vise
so
that
he
had
but
to
bend
a
finger
breadth
to
kiss
them
thy
feet
hesitate
woman
why
what
searchest
thou
knowledge
the
man
unconsciously
laced
his
fingers
in
hers
crushing
them
until
she
went
white
to
the
lips
knowledge
is
pain
woman
what
thou
of
pain
great
pain
how
thou
endure
it
then
he
let
her
hands
go
and
touched
the
silver
tray
of
sand
upon
the
table
beside
him
behold
love
shall
be
offered
thee
within
the
passing
of
a
few
hours
the
love
of
thy
right
hand
and
thou
shalt
reject
it
searching
for
that
which
thou
desirest
thou
shalt
surrounded
by
thy
women
who
love
thee
pass
down
the
river
even
unto
thebes
of
the
hundred
gates
yet
shalt
thou
not
find
it
in
the
river
nor
in
the
temples
upon
the
east
bank
of
the
waters
nor
upon
the
west
bank
drawing
a
square
in
the
sand
the
made
a
cross
at
the
upon
which
to
see
it
better
the
girl
drew
close
so
close
that
the
sweet
perfume
of
her
veils
filled
his
nostrils
then
shalt
thou
in
thy
search
go
even
under
the
stars
to
the
gate
of
tomorrow
and
there
shall
thou
find
a
mare
descended
from
the
mares
of
mohammed
the
prophet
of
allah
the
one
and
only
god
white
is
the
mare
and
beautiful
yea
even
is
she
like
unto
thee
thou
woman
of
ivory
her
bit
is
of
silver
her
bridle
of
plaited
gold
her
encrusted
with
jewels
thou
wilt
spring
upon
her
and
she
knowing
her
way
will
bring
thee
to
the
tents
of
purple
and
gold
ah
whispered
the
girl
the
tents
of
the
queen
they
are
the
talk
of
cairo
but
nobody
at
least
no
foreigner
has
seen
them
no
man
but
the
servants
no
woman
but
the
mother
of
him
who
is
the
master
has
even
set
foot
within
the
tents
of
purple
and
of
gold
no
one
but
the
master
has
set
foot
in
the
tent
which
stands
between
them
the
tent
of
death
and
in
them
if
i
come
what
what
should
i
find
no
harm
shall
befall
thee
no
smirching
of
thy
fair
name
the
master
alone
shall
greet
thee
and
when
thou
hast
found
that
for
which
thou
searchest
then
shalt
thou
return
if
so
thou
wilt
and
peace
rest
i
think
i
mean
is
it
in
your
tents
of
purple
and
gold
peace
is
to
be
found
within
the
temple
of
anubis
who
is
the
god
of
death
and
there
only
the
girl
shivered
and
lifted
her
head
as
from
some
part
of
the
hotel
there
drifted
the
wonderful
desert
which
begins
my
love
for
thee
is
as
the
sun
at
noon
then
she
looked
at
the
man
whose
face
she
had
not
plainly
seen
in
the
passing
of
the
hour
how
am
i
to
believe
you
will
you
give
me
a
sign
something
anything
so
that
i
shall
know
that
if
i
ever
want
to
visit
the
wonderful
tents
i
shall
find
them
she
only
spoke
to
gain
time
knowing
that
outside
the
curtain
there
stretched
the
path
across
the
field
of
content
she
deliberately
placed
her
foot
upon
the
desert
sand
and
whilst
common
sense
urged
her
to
get
out
of
the
room
she
listened
to
temptation
and
lingered
throwing
safety
to
the
four
winds
opening
wide
her
arms
to
danger
by
the
sign
of
the
black
stallion
who
awaits
thee
at
dawn
near
all
that
remaineth
upright
of
the
city
of
on
shalt
thou
find
the
tents
of
purple
and
gold
but
i
do
ride
any
more
said
damaris
i
ca
find
a
horse
a
good
one
and
i
do
know
where
the
city
of
on
is
thou
shall
know
thou
ivory
casket
to
which
love
is
the
key
and
if
thou
one
afar
off
as
thou
ridest
into
the
desert
at
dawn
fear
not
for
behold
is
thy
beauty
spoken
of
yea
even
in
the
harem
and
it
were
not
wise
for
thee
to
ride
alone
the
girl
put
out
her
hand
towards
the
silken
curtain
how
do
you
know
who
i
am
by
thy
voice
which
is
as
the
wind
of
dawn
she
hesitated
divided
between
a
desire
to
know
more
about
this
man
and
an
innate
courtesy
which
forbade
her
questioning
search
not
ask
not
woman
said
the
divining
her
thoughts
for
i
am
not
worthy
of
thy
notice
were
i
to
cross
thy
threshold
were
i
to
lay
my
hand
upon
thee
as
surely
should
i
pollute
thee
there
is
that
within
me
which
cries
aloud
urging
me
to
lead
thy
feet
upon
the
burning
desert
sands
and
again
there
is
that
within
me
which
would
fain
force
thee
for
thy
happiness
upon
the
path
running
through
the
field
of
content
yet
behold
art
thou
all
safe
with
me
could
i
help
you
if
you
were
to
tell
me
your
trouble
perhaps
it
would
be
easier
the
moment
is
not
yet
woman
but
being
a
teller
of
tales
even
as
i
am
a
teller
of
fortunes
one
day
will
i
sit
at
thy
feet
and
for
the
passing
of
an
hour
will
tell
thee
the
story
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
you
have
made
this
hour
pass
so
pleasantly
that
i
should
should
like
to
to
give
you
something
so
as
as
to
show
you
how
pleased
i
am
but
i
have
nothing
with
me
nothing
she
put
out
her
hands
and
turned
them
down
the
man
looked
down
at
her
for
a
moment
with
blazing
eyes
give
me
as
a
reward
allah
give
me
they
stood
quite
still
as
the
torrent
surged
about
them
give
me
the
ring
from
off
thy
finger
he
added
gently
the
girl
held
out
her
hand
take
it
though
it
seems
a
poor
reward
for
all
you
have
promised
me
nay
give
it
thou
to
me
she
slipped
it
off
and
held
it
out
showing
a
bruise
across
the
back
of
her
hand
allah
whispered
the
man
that
i
should
mark
thee
thus
and
yet
in
love
in
love
he
took
the
ring
of
which
the
setting
held
an
emerald
in
the
form
of
a
scarab
with
heartshaped
base
the
turned
it
over
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
then
held
it
out
nay
this
i
can
not
take
i
thought
it
was
a
ring
from
the
bazaar
to
go
with
thy
dress
of
fantasy
behold
it
is
an
amulet
of
the
heart
of
nay
i
can
not
tell
thus
quickly
of
what
dynasty
with
words
of
power
engraved
upon
it
which
read
thus
heart
my
mother
my
heart
my
mother
my
heart
whereby
i
came
into
the
girl
listened
entranced
touching
the
ring
with
which
felt
as
upon
the
man
hand
what
is
an
amulet
of
the
heart
in
the
days
of
ancient
egypt
when
the
heart
had
been
taken
from
the
dead
body
for
purposes
of
preservation
an
amulet
a
scarab
sometimes
was
placed
within
the
body
to
ensure
it
life
and
movement
in
the
new
life
they
both
stood
looking
down
upon
the
jewel
the
girl
resting
upon
the
man
hand
keep
it
she
said
softly
keep
it
i
will
keep
it
to
replace
that
which
has
gone
from
me
i
will
restore
it
to
its
shape
i
will
take
from
it
the
golden
setting
of
the
ring
i
will
wear
it
upon
my
breast
and
bending
he
gently
raised
the
yashmak
in
both
hands
and
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
few
inches
which
had
rested
above
her
crimson
mouth

ben
kelham
disguised
as
rameses
the
great
laid
a
hand
upon
the
shoulder
as
passing
to
the
left
of
the
tent
she
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
leading
to
the
grounds
whilst
sounds
of
wrath
came
from
the
serried
ranks
of
those
who
wished
to
pry
into
the
future
the
had
sent
word
that
there
would
be
no
more
reading
of
horoscopes
or
hands
that
evening
and
had
absented
himself
therewith
through
a
back
entrance
you
been
a
long
time
said
ben
kelham
he
looked
magnificent
as
the
great
sestoris
who
had
stood
well
over
six
feet
in
the
days
of
ancient
egypt
what
was
the
man
telling
you
damaris
was
disturbed
and
it
was
most
unfortunate
that
under
the
spur
of
inquietude
he
should
have
chosen
just
this
occasion
and
this
moment
to
allow
a
hint
of
authority
to
creep
into
his
voice
and
a
shadow
of
proprietorship
to
show
in
his
actions
how
do
you
know
who
i
am
parried
the
girl
coldly
as
she
shrugged
the
proprietory
hand
off
her
shoulder
wellington
gave
you
away
he
followed
your
trail
to
the
tent
and
sat
growling
at
everybody
until
i
came
along
and
removed
him
i
wish
you
would
leave
the
dog
alone
said
damaris
with
a
certain
amount
of
acerbity
he
is
my
custos
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
guardian
you
want
damaris
you
are
too
beautiful
you
know
let
us
sit
here
it
lovely
and
warm
and
the
stars
look
just
like
diamonds
do
they
i
would
rather
walk
said
damaris
who
was
longing
to
sit
down
but
she
sat
down
when
ben
kelham
took
her
by
the
elbow
and
led
her
to
the
seat
and
she
sat
quite
still
when
he
suddenly
took
both
her
hands
oh
do
ben
she
said
when
he
pulled
them
up
against
his
heart
i
ca
stand
any
more
and
he
being
in
the
uptak
failed
to
catch
her
in
this
slip
of
the
tongue
i
want
you
for
my
wife
dear
was
all
he
said
then
damaris
pulled
her
hands
away
and
removing
the
yashmak
looked
up
into
his
face
whilst
he
drew
a
breath
sharply
at
the
beauty
of
her
i
love
you
so
dear
i
a
clumsy
fool
at
speaking
but
i
could
show
you
how
i
love
you
i
want
to
marry
you
and
take
you
right
away
home
do
you
know
i
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
but
i
somehow
feel
you
are
in
danger
out
here
i
will
you
damaris
looked
to
the
right
and
looked
to
the
left
hesitated
and
chose
the
middle
path
i
ca
answer
you
now
ben
i
i
not
sure
about
loving
you
and
of
course
one
ca
marry
without
that
on
both
sides
can
one
oh
the
blessed
little
ignoramus
besides
she
added
as
an
afterthought
i
so
young
and
so
are
you
oh
damaris
surely
you
do
want
to
wait
until
you
find
someone
who
had
lots
of
experience
which
only
means
that
he
has
been
playing
the
game
as
far
as
his
future
wife
is
concerned
and
will
come
to
you
like
a
suit
returned
from
the
cleaner
the
kelhams
always
marry
young
and
our
brides
are
always
very
young
that
why
i
think
we
so
strong
and
he
veered
suddenly
from
the
mazy
subject
of
eugenics
and
pleaded
hard
persuasively
stubbornly
but
damaris
just
as
stubbornly
shook
her
head
besides
ben
this
is
unexpected
i
have
seen
anything
of
you
since
i
have
been
out
surely
if
you
love
me
so
you
would
have
come
over
more
often
to
to
prepare
the
way
she
unashamedly
exposed
her
hurt
whilst
the
man
inwardly
called
himself
every
kind
of
a
fool
for
having
listened
to
another
voice
upon
a
subject
as
vital
and
tricky
as
love
still
he
urged
and
pleaded
being
of
those
who
refusing
to
take
no
as
an
answer
usually
succeed
in
attaining
their
desire
a
wearisome
process
but
well
worth
while
once
in
a
lifetime
whatever
kind
of
a
clutter
those
first
cousins
obstinacy
stubbornness
and
strong
will
cause
you
to
accumulate
about
your
feet
at
other
times
i
do
know
enough
to
marry
persisted
the
girl
i
want
to
know
what
love
really
is
first
oh
but
dear
i
can
teach
you
all
you
want
to
know
replied
the
man
in
the
customary
manner
of
the
male
but
i
want
to
know
all
about
the
different
kinds
there
are
no
different
kinds
damaris
there
is
only
one
sort
then
explain
this
to
me
it
seemed
that
two
months
before
the
girl
had
left
england
she
had
found
the
tweeny
lizzie
stitch
by
name
sobbing
over
the
cinders
in
her
grate
the
besmirched
little
face
like
a
sodden
little
pudding
had
been
covered
with
grimy
hands
and
the
thin
little
chest
had
heaved
under
the
scanty
cotton
blouse
and
the
stress
of
the
tale
of
betrayal
and
desertion
i
did
know
miss
i
did
do
it
purposelike
for
a
lark
i
did
think
it
was
love

what
what
is
pardinned
well
miss
if
you
think
it
wise
to
force
i
do
what
you

not
about

as
i
worrying
it
i
must
have
a
father
for
the
kid
i
could
put
it
out
an
lose
it
not
so
then
had
come
about
a
strange
scene
of
transformation
confronted
by
damaris
with
a
in
one
hand
a
special
license
in
the
other
and
wellington
at
her
heels
the
young
man
had
professed
a
desire
to
marry
the
tweeny
on
the
spot
then
had
been
granted
a
glimpse
of
what
love
real
love
can
be
to
the
tweeny
maid
changing
her
into
a
veritable
spitfire
who
had
turned
and
rent
the
youth
i
would
you
nohow
no
not
if
yer
were
the
larst
man
on
earth
not
i
would
i
get
through
my
trouble

by
meself
thanking
you
kindly
for
troubling
an
i
wait
until
mister
right
comes
along
that
what
i
do
mister
runaway
and
when
runaway
had
hinted
that
mr
right
might
kick
at
being
called
upon
to
shoulder
the
encumbrances
of
others
she
had
snatched
the
special
license
from
her
young
mistress
torn
it
into
bits
flung
it
into
the
foxy
face
and
blazed
into
a
little
tweeny
maid
of
a
woman
i
said
mr
right
did
i
yer
bloomin
chuckhead
unnerstand
that
it
was
all
done
in
mistake
an
not
by
preference
so
to
speak
an
unnerstandin
he
forgive
lots
of
them
mistakes
are
made
by
girls
like
me
thumping
of
washed
but
still
grimy
hand
above
gallant
little
heart
through
swipes
like
you
life
full
of
down
our
way
but
life
love
and
love
life
and
you
ca
get
away
from
that
that
yer
ca
and
i
raver
die
wiv
my
love
shut
up
more
thumps
above
gallant
little
heart
than
throw
it
away
on
a
louse
like
you
i
would
not
ben
kelham
said
nothing
and
there
fell
a
silence
between
the
two
though
the
egyptian
night
was
as
full
of
noise
as
it
ever
is
in
the
big
cities
of
the
east
what
did
she
mean
ben
said
damaris
at
last
by
that
love
which
understanding
can
forgive
even
even
trouble
and
to
ben
kelham
came
the
tweeny
glimpse
of
the
understanding
of
real
love
he
rose
and
swept
damaris
at
the
mastery
into
his
arms
where
he
held
her
as
he
might
have
held
a
child
that
dear
and
he
spoke
choosing
the
simplest
words
just
because
he
knew
no
others
that
means
that
if
you
said
you
loved
me
and
i
if
i
ever
found
you
in
a
how
shall
i
put
it
in
no
matter
how
compromising
a
situation
that
i
should
love
you
just
the
same
because
i
should
know
that
although
to
all
appearances
you
you
might
have
sinned
yet
the
real
you
the
pure
honourable
perfect
woman
in
you
could
not
show
the
smallest
stain
do
you
understand
almost
whispered
the
girl
as
she
lay
still
in
the
arms
that
held
her
as
a
child
you
to
understand
listen
it
may
sound
brutal
but
got
to
understand
my
love
for
you
supposing
you
disappeared
as
englishwomen
do
sometimes
in
the
east
supposing
i
searched
and
found
you
and
you
you
were
you
were
like
the
little
tweeny
girl
what
should
i
do
why
damaris
unless
you
came
to
me
and
confessed
to
sin
i
marry
you
loving
you
understanding
you
without
asking
any
questions
without
asking
any
explanation
yes
dear
yes
because
i
love
you
and
you
would
forgive
me
but
dear
there
would
be
any
need
for
forgiveness
the
real
pure
you
would
not
have
done
anything
wrong
then
he
blundered
like
most
big
men
he
was
diffident
he
underestimated
the
attraction
of
his
strength
allied
to
a
very
gentle
courtesy
in
fact
bound
up
in
his
love
for
damaris
he
had
never
given
it
a
thought
excepting
to
curse
the
awkwardness
of
his
body
and
the
slowness
of
his
speech
he
knew
nothing
of
the
honesty
which
looked
out
of
the
eyes
the
quiet
strength
of
his
movements
and
speech
the
feeling
of
confidence
he
inspired
he
was
not
given
to
he
loved
the
sun
in
the
heavens
the
grass
under
foot
and
the
traditions
of
his
house
too
much
to
waste
time
on
that
kind
of
thing
so
that
fearing
to
have
hurt
the
girl
or
bored
the
girl
he
plumped
her
on
her
feet
when
he
could
have
won
her
and
saved
her
and
others
including
himself
a
mint
of
pain
if
he
had
only
just
crushed
her
up
to
his
heart
and
kissed
her
she
stood
quite
still
with
that
dazed
little
feeling
which
falls
upon
one
who
has
entered
the
wrong
room
i
not
going
to
bother
you
any
more
dear
he
said
watching
for
the
flash
of
relief
which
did
not
cross
the
beautiful
face
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
has
come
a
report
of
lion
somewhere
near
karnak
i
think
i
shall
run
down
and
have
a
look
round
i
thought
of
going
on
to
nairobi
once
i
was
really
fit
so
have
got
all
my
shooting
gear
with
me
but
remember
you
have
only
to
send
for
me
and
i
will
come
and
do
try
to
run
away
damaris
and
his
voice
was
stern
as
he
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
drew
her
towards
him
you
are
mine
i
letting
you
go
now
because
you
want
to
learn
about
life
and
that
you
ca
do
if
you
have
a
man
always
on
your
heels
you
will
learn
all
right
dear
and
suffer
a
bit
dear
but
you
will
come
to
me
in
the
end
i
ca
offer
you
the
witchery
and
colouring
and
poetry
of
the
east
but
i
do
offer
you
the
biggest
love
there
has
ever
been
in
a
heart
for
a
woman
and
a
troupe
of
riotous
guests
came
streaming
down
the
path
one
they
shouted
one
masks
off
masks
off
the
two
walked
slowly
towards
them
you
like
a
lion
skin
would
you
he
asked
eagerly
and
stared
amazed
at
the
reproachful
hurt
eyes
which
looked
back
at
him
just
as
the
dancers
swooped
upon
her
a
lion
skin
when
she
was
craving
for
the
strength
of
his
arms
about
her
and
the
tower
of
his
love
behind
her
from
the
top
of
which
she
could
safely
make
of
derision
at
life
standing
with
in
one
hand
and
a
cane
in
the
other
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
entered
the
ballroom
and
he
went
back
to
the
seat
in
the
garden
unconscious
of
the
woman
who
watched
and
as
the
merry
little
crowd
ran
laughing
into
the
hotel
the
duchess
with
mind
intent
on
a
cigarette
slipped
out
of
another
door
and
hurried
as
fast
as
her
outrageous
heels
would
allow
her
to
a
seat
under
the
she
took
a
three
castles
from
the
jewelled
louis
xv
rasped
a
match
on
the
sole
of
one
little
crimson
shoe
lit
her
cigarette
and
studied
the
slipper
then
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
a
man
an
arab
standing
beside
the
seat
there
had
been
no
sound
just
out
of
the
dark
he
had
suddenly
materialised
in
the
startling
silent
way
of
the
east
well
does
it
behove
us
to
remember
that
we
have
claimed
the
privilege
of
giving
lessons
in
morality
culture
manners
in
fact
in
one
word
civilisation
to
the
world
at
large
in
the
glaring
sun
of
an
eastern
you
can
sit
with
your
feet
figuratively
or
literally
on
the
table
if
it
pleases
you
it
will
but
be
accounted
as
one
more
eccentricity
unto
you
but
in
the
shadows
you
would
retain
the
position
of
teacher
to
the
world
at
large
keep
the
heels
on
the
rail
of
your
chair
for
there
are
ears
and
eyes
in
the
shadows
and
behind
the
silken
curtain
but
it
took
a
good
deal
more
than
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
native
to
make
the
old
lady
start
she
put
out
her
cigarette
with
the
toe
of
a
red
shoe
took
another
from
the
rasped
a
match
not
on
the
sole
of
her
foot
this
time
lit
the
fragrant
weed
and
looked
at
the
man
who
salaamed
yes
she
said
courteously
i
am
the
great
lady
in
the
sand
by
the
stars
or
the
lines
of
your
jewelled
hand
if
in
your
graciousness
you
will
permit
me
i
will
tell
you
your
future
my
son
behold
i
am
near
the
sunset
the
moment
approaches
when
my
tired
feet
will
advance
still
further
upon
the
bridge
which
leadeth
me
to
my
god
and
your
god
what
is
past
i
know
what
is
what
is
to
be
is
so
near
that
behold
sometimes
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
i
hear
the
angels
whispering
as
they
take
counsel
as
to
the
moment
when
one
shall
tap
me
upon
the
shoulder
saying
he
sank
to
the
ground
just
at
her
feet
and
looked
up
in
the
splendid
old
face
with
an
agony
of
hurt
born
of
misunderstanding
in
his
own
so
that
suddenly
realising
that
her
refusal
had
been
taken
for
antipathy
she
stretched
out
her
hand
which
having
first
pulled
a
corner
of
his
white
mantle
between
he
held
upon
the
back
of
his
own
tell
me
then
of
those
i
love
the
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
thy
hands
are
full
of
white
woman
thy
head
is
crowned
with
them
thy
feet
pass
upon
them
thou
art
all
love
yea
even
though
there
are
many
upon
the
bridge
who
having
preceded
thee
await
thy
coming
yet
art
thou
surrounded
with
love
and
in
the
flowers
in
thy
hands
is
there
one
which
thou
cherishest
and
for
which
thou
fearest
fear
not
wise
woman
let
thy
heart
beat
tranquilly
at
dawn
at
noon
and
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
for
it
is
written
that
no
harm
shall
befall
the
flower
no
stain
shall
mark
the
ivory
petals
of
innocence
no
rude
hand
pluck
it
before
its
time
thou
art
not
the
only
one
to
love
the
flower
wise
woman
there
is
one
also
who
loveth
it
and
watcheth
it
and
will
pluck
it
in
due
season
there
is
yet
another
who
loveth
and
watcheth
but
from
a
great
great
distance
if
by
the
grace
of
allah
who
is
god
the
flower
should
be
placed
even
for
the
passing
of
an
hour
within
the
hands
of
him
who
watcheth
from
afar
i
tell
thee
for
so
it
is
written
fear
not
for
no
harm
shall
befall
the
fragrant
blossom
the
old
woman
nodded
her
head
so
that
the
diamond
leaves
glistened
and
smiled
gently
and
lifting
her
hand
pulled
aside
the
corner
of
the
mantle
and
laid
her
hand
again
on
his
nay
touch
me
not
for
fear
i
shall
pollute
thee
thou
woman
of
one
great
race
thou
descendant
of
one
unbroken
line
thou
noble
with
unblemished
shield
then
she
leant
right
forward
and
laid
both
hands
upon
his
shoulders
my
son
my
son
perchance
could
a
very
wise
very
old
woman
help
thee
in
thy
stress
for
behold
she
understands
all
things
having
herself
passed
through
the
troubled
waters
of
life
the
shook
his
head
as
he
gripped
the
little
hands
upon
his
shoulders
for
me
there
is
no
help
wise
woman
but
she
who
loves
me
she
whom
i
love
and
for
whom
i
would
die
even
breaks
her
heart
through
me
her
in
my
desert
home
her
beautiful
eyes
are
full
of
tears
she
lifts
not
her
head
and
my
father
whom
i
honour
is
far
from
her
in
her
stress
perchance
in
the
golden
mint
of
thy
heart
hast
thou
a
few
coins
of
patience
wisdom
and
love
to
spare
as
the
old
woman
got
slowly
to
her
feet
the
man
sprang
up
beside
her
my
son
though
thou
drainest
a
fortune
from
the
mint
of
love
at
dawn
yet
is
it
still
there
at
eventide
she
whispered
as
she
raised
her
jewelled
hand
to
his
shoulders
and
pulled
him
down
towards
her
my
son
thou
art
my
son
and
i
have
faith
in
and
a
great
love
for
thee
and
thine
and
she
kissed
him
upon
the
forehead
whilst
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
turned
towards
the
house
without
noticing
a
man
and
a
woman
sitting
in
the
shadows
at
the
far
side
of
the
grounds
for
the
woman
who
watched
was
zulannah
the
harlot
who
had
gained
an
easy
admission
under
the
secrecy
of
her
veils
and
the
potency
of
backschish
and
as
ben
kelham
had
sat
down
she
had
crept
quietly
from
behind
the
palms
to
stand
a
shimmering
bundle
of
silks
and
satins
in
front
of
the
man
who
looked
up
in
annoyance
and
then
smiled
you
really
could
be
rude
to
anything
so
tantalisingly
beautiful
especially
when
the
lady
of
your
choice
has
just
shown
a
certain
lamentable
want
of
appreciation
in
regard
to
your
person
and
propositions
it
one
fair
lady
you
must
unmask
and
he
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
zulannah
had
lifted
her
veil
and
the
moments
sped
as
she
wove
the
golden
web
of
beauty
and
desire
and
love
into
which
however
the
clumsy
fly
refused
to
be
enticed
but
ben
kelham
for
all
his
slowness
was
no
fool
and
understanding
that
the
woman
was
offering
him
something
outside
her
usual
wares
and
understanding
also
the
danger
of
rousing
the
wrath
of
such
a
woman
he
dealt
with
the
matter
as
delicately
as
he
come
but
once
to
my
entertainments
she
urged
my
girls
shall
dance
for
thee
my
animals
fight
for
thee
the
man
shuddered
sick
to
the
soul
at
the
thought
of
the
means
by
which
this
woman
enslaved
her
suitors
am
i
not
beautiful
she
added
she
made
her
last
bid
she
stepped
back
into
the
moonlight
and
unwound
her
veils
from
about
her
standing
palpitating
trembling
under
the
possession
of
her
strange
love
beautiful
she
was
a
dream
yet
beside
her
beauty
the
pure
loveliness
of
damaris
hethencourt
would
have
shown
like
the
work
of
an
old
master
beside
a
coarse
copy
but
what
will
you
some
like
the
and
some
the
stretching
plain
others
the
turbulent
ocean
and
yet
others
the
farmyard
with
its
rural
sights
and
sounds
thank
goodness
for
it
just
imagine
the
lamentation
throughout
the
world
if
love
like
the
set
fashions
for
the
seasons
love
dictates
that
women
this
season
shall
resemble
the
dazzling
peaks
of
the
himalayas
and
we
looking
as
the
majority
of
us
look
not
that
we
should
really
be
downhearted
about
it
not
a
bit
only
let
the
decree
go
forth
and
every
one
of
us
at
the
end
of
a
week
or
so
would
by
hook
or
by
crook
have
acquired
a
distinctly
appearance
but
kelham
looked
up
looked
long
and
smiled
you
beautiful
very
beautiful
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
have
seen
save
one
zulannah
recognised
her
defeat
and
in
a
whirl
of
rage
and
scented
veils
disappeared
through
the
palms
and
arrived
at
her
house
she
stormed
through
court
and
rooms
and
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
scented
garden
leaving
a
trail
of
servants
lying
face
downwards
in
her
wake
she
leant
over
the
marble
balustrade
and
looked
down
into
the
huge
pit
with
marble
walls
and
sanded
floor
all
around
it
were
cages
in
which
were
confined
great
beasts
and
alcoves
in
which
she
and
her
guests
behind
iron
bars
would
sit
when
sated
with
love
and
feasting
to
watch
the
animals
fight
to
the
death
then
she
ran
quickly
down
the
flight
of
marble
steps
and
clapped
her
hands
from
some
dark
corner
a
shape
came
running
ambling
like
some
gigantic
ape
maintaining
an
upright
position
by
means
of
an
occasional
thrust
at
the
ground
with
the
knuckles
of
the
left
hand
the
small

themselves
against

were

of

mean
she
was
a
niggard
in
things

did
not

herself
so
that
to

his
numerous
progeny
of
repulsive

the

starved
the

not
that
zulannah
cared
one
iota
for
their
hunger
or
suffering
it
made
them
fight
the
merrier
for
a
bit
of
meat
and
she
sat
in
her
ebony
chair
close
to
the
bars
with
a
brazier
beside
her
and
laughed
delightedly
as
the
liberated
lion
flung
itself
at
the
cages
in
which
roared
its
wretched
brethren
and
then
the
great
beast
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
den
growling
softly
snuffing
the
air
then
with
heartrending
roar
hurled
itself
straight
at
the
bars

she
sat
was
she
afraid
not
one
bit
she
was
behind
the
bars
she
laughed
aloud
and
clapped
her
hands
standing
just
out
of
reach
of
the
paw
which
tried
to
reach
her
back
across
the
sand
rushed
the
animal
and
then
with
all
its
might
crashed
against
the
barrier
a
look
of
horror
swept
the
woman

the

bent
she
sensed
her
danger
but
kept
her
nerve
without
hesitating
she
turned
to
the
brazier
at
her
side
carefully
selected
a
handle
well
wrapped
about
and
turning
again
swiftly
thrust
the
point
down
the
lion
maw
best
not
to
describe
the
rest
of
the
awful
scene
in
which
a
woman
safe
behind
bars
clapped
her
hands
over
the
pain
she
had
caused
but
is
it
surprising
that

were

damaris
laughed
aloud
from
sheer
content
as
she
touched
the
stallion
with
her
heel
and
held
him
fretting
eager
to
be
away
over
the
sand
to
wherever
fate
pointed
the
words

the
this
early
morning
following
hard
upon
her
arrival
in

she
slipped
from
her
room
wakened
the
astounded
of
the
desert
palace

and
demanded
a
car
to
be
brought
upon
the
instant
and
lucky
it
was
for
her
that
she
made
one
of
the
ducal

for
nothing

would
have
procured
her
her
heart

at
that
untoward
hour
before
dawn
with
wellington
beside
her
she
drove
hard
along
the
deserted
towards
the
village
of
makariyeh
where
under
a
sycamore
is
said
the
virgin
and
child
rested
on
their
flight
into
egypt
the
seemed
to
hurl
the
shadows
back
as
she
raced
down
the
sharia
towards
the
ruins
of
old
heliopolis
which
is
all
that
remains
of
the
great
seat
of
learning
the
biblical
city
of
on
and
the
sky
lightened
way
down
in
the
east
as
she
drove
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
fort
to
the
obelisk
known
to
the
arab
as
and
there
the
words
of
the
came
true
for
fretting
and
fuming
in
an
endeavour
to
unseat
his
who
rode
him
without
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
rearing
and
backing
at
the
sound
of
the
engine
throbbing
in
the
gloom
was
the
stallion
of
unayza
damaris
did
not
cast
a
look
at
the
obelisk
she
had
eyes
only
for
the
beautiful
beast
which
seemingly
she
was
to
ride
on
a
single
rein
and
a
wisp
of
a
saddle
standing
sixteen
hands
born
of
the
desert
nervous
and
he
was
no
fit
mount
for
a
woman
and
a
gleam
of
anxiety
flashed
across
the
face
as
he
measured
the
slender
girl
with
his
eye
and
the
in
the
name
of
the
the
servant
salaamed
as
he
mechanically
repeated
the
unintelligible
sentence
which
had
been
drummed
into
him
by
his
master
and
damaris
smiled
and
replied
in
the
servant
tongue
to
his
amazement
and
walked
up
close
to
holding
out
a
flat
palm
with
sugar
upon
it
it
took
some
time
before
he
snuffled
her
hand
and
then
only
by
stratagem
she
mounted
swinging
herself
in
a
bound
to
the
saddle
as
the
groom
slipped
to
the
ground
on
the
upon
which
wheeled
sharply
and
headed
straight
for
the
village
of
khankah
which
is
the
outskirt
proper
of
the
desert
for
two
and
a
half
miles
at
a
tearing
gallop
the
girl
made
no
attempt
to
show
any
authority
but
once
on
the
very
edge
of
the
desert
she
did
for
this
was
the
moment
of
her
life
when
alone
free
she
should
ride
out
into
the
unknown
and
she
had
no
inclination
or
intention
of
being
hurled
through
that
moment
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
sooltan
behaving
like
a
very
demon
tried
his
best
to
unseat
the
light
weight
upon
his
back
by
the
simple
and
usually
so
effective
methods
of
rearing
plunging
and
bucking
but
damaris
only
smiled
and
shouted
as
she
looked
towards
the
east
caring
not
a
jot
for
any
vagary
so
content
was
she
but
as
the
sun
leapt
clear
of
the
horizon
she
gave
one
cry
touched
the
stallion
lightly
upon
the
neck
gave
him
his
head
and
was
across
the
desert
unmindful
of
an
arab
who
some
distance
away
which
in
the
desert
is
really
no
optical
distance
at
all
headed
a
grey
mare
thoroughbred
and
of
mighty
endurance
in
the
same
direction
where
is
there
anything
to
compare
to
riding
across
the
desert
at
dawn
at
dawn
when
to
your
right
and
to
your
left
march
phalanxes
of
ghostly
shapes
which
maybe
are
the
shadows
of
the
night
or
maybe
as
says
the
legend
the
ghosts
of
the
many
kingdoms
buried
in
oblivion
and
the
relentless
sands
when
the
whistling
of
the
wind
is
as
the
shouting
of
men
and
the
thunder
of
your
horse
hoofs
as
the
rolling
of
many
drums
calling
you
through
the
power
of
past
centuries
and
the
ecstasy
of
the
solitude
in
your
heart
out
to
the
mystery
of
the
plains
mystery
fascination
spell
lure
call
of
the
desert
all
fine
words
but
hopeless
to
explain
that
which
has
lured
more
than
one
white
woman
out
into
the
golden
wilderness
to
the
wrecking
of
her
soul
and
which
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
waves
which
trick
us
into
such
pitiable
hysteria
and
hallucination
but
there
is
no
mystery
about
that
which
called
damaris
it
was
the
joy
of
youth
the
salt
of
novelty
the
exhilarating
sympathy
between
horse
and
rider
she
shouted
as
she
seemingly
rode
straight
into
the
massed
colouring
of
the
sunrise
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
golden
banners
flung
across
the
sky
and
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
back
at
the
hem
of
night
garments
disappearing
down
in
the
west
she
was
still
a
child
for
those
auxiliaries
love
and
life
had
not
yet
lain
hand
upon
her
they
had
but
pulled
aside
the
veil
from
before
her
eyes
for
one
brief
second
and
she
dazzled
by
the
glimpse
had
pulled
it
back
hastily
neither
was
there
anything
to
tell
her
that
upon
a
not
very
far
distant
day
the
veil
would
be
torn
from
her
leaving
her
to
be
blinded
by
the
radiance
of
the
greatest
light
in
the
world
and
she
rode
carelessly
without
a
thought
to
the
passing
of
time
or
to
the
speed
of
who
was
all
out
in
an
endeavour
to
find
his
stable
also
his
companions
from
whom
he
had
been
parted
for
many
weary
weeks
that
they
happened
to
be
in
the
oasis
of
khargegh
some
few
hundred
miles
down
the
nile
he
was
not
to
know
he
only
knew
that
the
desert
was
his
home
and
that
in
it
and
of
it
was
his
happiness
to
be
found
and
it
was
only
when
damaris
turned
to
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
city
of
on
from
a
far
distance
that
she
discovered
that
they
had
disappeared
in
a
mist
which
was
merely
the
combination
of
the
distance
and
the
waters
of
the
oasis
evaporating
in
the
morning
sun
she
tried
to
pull
the
stallion
gently
at
first
and
then
with
all
her
might
but
to
no
purpose
for
nothing
but
the
voice
of
his
master
or
his
own
particular
could
stop
once
he
had
got
the
light
bit
between
his
teeth
and
of
the
death
from
thirst
which
awaited
him
and
his
rider
upon
this
particular
venture
if
he
continued
in
his
obstinacy
he
had
of
course
no
warning
what
a
nuisance
said
damaris
as
she
looked
round
the
great
yellow
plain
which
stretched
a
carpet
of
level
sand
to
the
west
and
under
her
horse
feet
and
broke
to
the
east
into
a
chain
of
hummocks
piled
by
the
last
sandstorm
which
had
caused
such
devastation
in
the
nomad
tribes
and
such
annoyance
to
the
visitors
at
heliopolis
she
felt
no
fear
only
an
increasing
vacuum
beneath
her
waistbelt
and
distress
for
the
worry
her
long
absence
might
cause
her
godmother
and
will
have
chewed
everything
chewable
in
the
car
also
the
legs

the
by
the
time
i
get
back
she
exclaimed
and
i
ca
do
anything
i
irrevocably
given
his
head
no
use
slipping
from
the
saddle
because
i
could
walk
back
i
she
broke
off
suddenly
rose
in
the
stirrups
and
waved
and
a
more
radiant
picture
of
youth
you
could
not
have
wished
to
see
in
a
lifetime

she
shouted

an
oasis
with
tents
women
and
children
and
men
come
round
sooltan
come
round
and
she
pulled
with
all
her
strength
and
still
to
no
avail
for
oblivious
of
the
peaceful
verdant
patch
the
mighty
animal
forged
ahead
well
i
shall
have
to
drop
from
the
saddle
let
sooltan
go
and
walk
over
to
them
they
are
sure
to
be
friendly
and
she
had
just
slipped
her
foot
from
the
stirrup
when
clear
and
insistent
there
came
a
ringing
cry
some
way
off
the
hawk
of
egypt
had
followed
her
from
the
village
of
khankah
with
intent
knowing
the
horse
she
rode
to
watch
over
but
not
intrude
his
presence
upon
her
he
had
known
for
some
time
that
was
out
of
hand
and
had
decided
to
call
him
after
a
mile
or
so
more
of
furious
exercise
but
instead
quite
suddenly
and
instinctively
he
cried
balak
which
means
be
careful
be
careful
and
pulled
the
mare
to
a
standstill
he
too
had
seen
the
mirage
of
the
peaceful
oasis
thrown
by
the
atmosphere
from
a
distance
of
eighty
miles
and
with
his
eyes
had
caught
the
little
movement
of
the
foot
and
connecting
the
two
he
insistently
called
the
stallion
knowing
that
a
drop
from
the
saddle
at
the
almost
incredible
speed
at
which
sooltan
was
going
might
easily
result
in
twisted
ankles
or
even
a
broken
neck
he
called
which
means
come
back
come
back
and
he
called
again
and
again
as
the
stallion
dropped
from
a
gallop
to
a
canter
a
canter
to
a
trot
then
stopped
dead
whinnied
gently
wheeled
sharply
and
stood
came
the
cry
and
with
the
cry
came
the
neighing
of
the
mare
the
stallion
lashed
out
reared
and
stood
still
ears
pricked
silken
mane
and
tail
flying
in
the
wind
then
answered
until
the
desert
seemed
filled
with
the
calling
of
the
noble
beasts
as
the
girl
sat
with
thudding
heart
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
distant
spot
where
fretted
and
fidgeted
the
mare
ridden
by
the
arab
then
something
within
her
rebelled
at
this
intrusion
upon
her
privacy
causing
her
to
be
suddenly
stricken
with
anger
and
confusion
take
me
to
the
tents
sooltan
she
cried
turning
to
look
back
take
but
why
oh
what
an
escape
a
mirage
a
but
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
sudden
bound
of
as
he
raced
in
obedience
to
his
master
call
the
man
waited
until
they
were
within
a
mile
of
him
then
he
wheeled
the
mare
and
took
her
back
along
her
tracks
urging
her
to
her
topmost
speed
swiftly
she
fled
and
swiftly
pursued
sooltan
the
man
not
once
turning
in
his
seat
and
as
they
neared
the
outskirts
of
the
oasis
of
heliopolis
hugh

urged
the
mare
so
that
she
gained
upon
the
stallion
and
beckoned
to
his
groom
who
had
run
from
the
obelisk
to
the
edge
of
the
desert
with
fear
in
his
heart
for
the
beast
but
not
one
whit
for
the
girl
and
he
caught
the
shouted
order
as
his
master
passed
him
at
full
speed
and
ran
out
shouting
in
his
turn
to
the
stallion
connecting
the
with
the
bucketsful
of
water
he
stood
so
badly
in
need
of
stopped
short
nearly
unseating
damaris
with
the
suddenness
of
his
decision
and
then
with
the
hand
of
the
groom
upon
his
heaving
flank
trotted
docilely
back
to
the
obelisk
where

risking

turned
himself
into

was
his
at

in

although

of

stretched
between
them

in

rush
of
the

the

and

did

turn
at

in
the

of

the

of

the

so
giving
a

to

he
tucked
the

in

him
and
drove
as

set
to

that

presence
should
not
be
thrust
upon
the
girl
or
the
old
woman
who
had
known
his
mother
he
sat
there
indifferent
to
or
oblivious
of
the
interest
his
presence
aroused
unconsciously
counting
the
vertebrae
of
the
lady
at
the
next
table
who
had
evidently
forgotten
some
essential
part
of
her
bodice
he
counted
the
vertebrae
in
the
back
of
the
lady
who
was
dying
to
turn
round
until
the
duchess
and
damaris
entered
the
room
then
he
clenched
his
hands
under
the
table
with
an
involuntary
shudder
of
disgust
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
girl
he
loved
in
evening
dress
and
every
instinct
of
the
oriental
in
him
was
outraged
at
the
sight
of
the
gleaming
neck
and
shoulders
and
hint
of
virgin
form
she
was
not
in
full
by
any
means
but
the
waiter
sleeve
was
but
an
inch
from
her
satin
skin
when
he
bent
over
her
so
that
although
he
had
long
grown
accustomed
in
europe
to
the
undraping
of
woman
o
nights
yet
because
he
loved
the
beautiful
girl
he
longed
for
the
right
to
walk
across
the
room
pick
her
up
in
his
arms
and
smothering
her
in
a
hide
her
forever
from
all
male
eyes
but
his
own
later
as
he
sat
alone
in
a
far
corner
of
the
he
twisted
the
dagger
of
love
this
way
and
that
in
his
tormented
heart
whilst
the
dogs
of
billi
worried
the
life
out
of
the
as
they
fretted
and
moaned
for
their
master
who
tarried
he
had
never
danced
himself
loathing
the
idea
of
the
propinquity
of
a
stranger
body
so
close
to
his
own
of
a
stranger
mouth
so
near
his
own
of
the
animal
odour
of
the
naked
body
which
no
perfume
can
hide
within
his
nostrils
just
as
he
loathed
the
idea
of
a
woman
passing
from
one
man
arms
to
throughout
the
best
part
of
a
night
he
had
no
desire
whatever
to
dance
with
damaris
but
all
the
eastern
in
him
longed
to
make
her
dance
for
him
in
the
desert
for
preference
under
the
light
of
the
moon
with
the
insistent
throbbing
of
the
drum
keeping
time
to
the
rhythm
of
the
slender
feet
upon
the
warm
sand
and
he
sat
and
dreamed
under
the
palms
taking
no
heed
of
the
sudden
cessation
of
music
the
gathering
of
the
dancers
against
the
walls
the
laughter
and
moistening
of
lip
with
furtive
tongue
and
the
unusual
feeling
of
expectancy
in
the
heavy
perfumed
air
but
he
came
back
to
earth
when
from
some
corner
of
the
room
there
came
the
faint
tapping
of
a
drum
three
times
there
fell
a
single
beat
then
a
gentle
roll
and
a
single
beat
bringing
him
to
his
feet
as
he
recognised
the
measure
just
as
the
lights
were
switched
off
excepting
for
one
great
beam
which
striking
down
from
some
device
in
the
ceiling
made
a
silvery
pool
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
no
he
cried
from
the
shadows
this
must
not
be
it
is
not
seemly
for
the
eyes
of
women
but
the
answer
to
this
protest
came
in
little
jeering
laughs
and
quick
remonstrance
from
those
who
feared
that
the
whetting
of
their
appetites
should
be
snatched
from
them
and
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
went
up
when
from
the
shadows
there
sprang
an
arabian
youth
beautiful
as
a
god
supple
as
a
snake
quick
upon
his
feet
as
any
fighting
stallion
he
stood
for
a
second
with
arms
outflung
to
the
men
and
women
he
knew
were
watching
his
every
movement
outside
the
radius
of
the
light
and
then
he
sprang
back
with
that
marvellous
leap
which
is
the
gift
of
some
arabian
male
dancers
ah
me
you
talk
in
pharisaic
whispers
of
the
nautch
girl
in
righteous
anger
against
the
dainty
geisha
in
horror
of
the
weaving
salomes
as
known
in
western
cities
wait
however
before
you
pour
the
last
drop
from
your
vials
of
wrath
and
indignation
until
you
have
seen
an
arab
dance
which
being
translated
means
the
dawn
you
can
put
what
interpretation
you
like
upon
it
the
dawn
of
day
or
love
anything
will
do
but
you
most
certainly
ought
not
to
watch
it
if
however
you
persist
in
so
doing
you
should
blush
to
the
roots
of
your
hair
you
will
not
because
it
will
be
the
perfect
poetry
of
motion
you
will
be
witnessing
also
ought
you
after
the
third
movement
to
turn
your
back
or
flee
the
room
you
will
not
again
because
of
the
mocking
sensuality
which
will
keep
you
rooted
where
you
stand
again
you
ought
to
stuff
your
ears
against
the
throbbing
of
the
drum
but
that
will
you
not
do
because
of
the
words
of
love
which
fall
seemingly
reft
from
the
dancer
lips
in
the
rapture
of
his
movements
it
is
the
last
word
in
sensual
ecstasy
and
should
be
prohibited
for
public
exhibition
to
europeans
yet
it
is
quite
impossible
to
point
at
any
one
movement
and
label
it
as
the
cause
of
the
tumult
within
you
but
hugh
carden
ali
standing
under
a
palm
turned
quickly
when
a
little
sound
of
distress
caught
his
ear
and
put
out
his
hand
and
pulled
the
girl
he
had
recognised
in
the
dark
by
her
perfume
towards
him
so
that
the
back
of
her
head
rested
against
his
arm
and
sensing
her
nausea
at
the
sight
from
which
she
had
been
trying
to
fly
and
knowing
the
sheer
impossibility
of
keeping
the
eyes
shut
in
a
theatre
he
pulled
his
handkerchief
from
his
sleeve
and
placed
it
across
her
eyes
save
for
the
back
of
her
head
resting
just
below
his
shoulder
he
did
not
touch
her
and
if
he
bent
his
head
so
that
the
perfumed
riot
of
her
curls
swept
his
cheek
should
it
count
as
a
grievous
sin
against
him
the
stone
beside
each
of
us
is
quite
likely
to
lie
untouched
throughout
our
span
of
plus
ten
at
the
last
beat
of
the
drum
and
just
before
the
lights
were
switched
on
damaris
was
alone
with
a
silken
handkerchief
in
her
hand
in
one
corner
of
which
as
she
discovered
later
was
embroidered
the
hawk
of
old
egypt
chapter
xii
hither
and
thither
moves
and
mates
and
slays
and
one
by
one
back
in
the
closet
omar
khayyam
hugh
carden
ali
with
the
dogs
of
billi
crushed
in
beside
him
raced
back
to
his
palace
in
cairo
and
with
the
shaggy
pair
at
his
heels
passed
to
his
side
of
the
great
house
his
as
nimble
as
a
monkey
as
devoted
as
a
dog
and
almost
dumb
by
reason
of
a
tongue
split
in
his
youth
for
misdemeanour
fell
on
his
knees
at
his
feet
he
worshipped
his
young
master
who
had
one
time
rescued
him
from
a
savage
baiting
crowd
in
the
bazaar
and
taking
him
into
his
service
had
made
him
his
own
particular
servant
he
equally
loathed
his
austere
bedroom
and
adjoining
with
simple
furniture
which
had
lately
come
from
a
dark
cold
country
across
the
sea
where
it
rains
without
ceasing
and
he
helped
strip
his
master
of
the
hateful
tight
hot
european
clothes
and
trotted
joyfully
after
him
to
the
and
watched
him
dive
in
and
swim
the
length
and
climb
out
the
other
end
and
disappear
between
curtains
into
the
luxurious
rooms
of
the
east
having
robed
him
agog
with
curiosity
and
at
a
discreet
distance
he
followed
the
resplendent
figure
in
his
satin
raiment
turban
glistening
with
jewels
and
hooded
falcon
on
wrist
and
cursed
the
dogs
under
his
breath
when
they
turned
and
growled
softly
but
his
curiosity
was
turned
to
a
great
amazement
when
his
master
passed
into
the
court
of
the
empty
luxuriant
perfumed
harem
where
once
had
loved
and
quarrelled
idled
and
fought
so
many
beautiful
women
under
the
orders
of
the
ethiopian
eunuch
giant
twin
of
qatim
in
the
service
of
zulannah
the
courtesan
the
harem
was
kept
swept
and
garnished
adorned
with
flowers
aglow
at
nights
with
a
myriad
soft
lights
hanging
from
the
ceiling
in
jewelled
lamps
to
which
were
flung
the
fountain
perfumed
drops
to
fall
and
break
on
marble
floor
and
silken
cushion
inlaid
table
and
birds
in
jewelled
cage
there
does
exist
a
different
kind
of
harem
dirty
gaudy
somewhat
like
the
inmates
over
the
whole
of
which
is
wise
to
draw
a
veil
the
eunuch
which
was
kept
in
a
certain
secret
nook
of
the
harem
court
had
become
sadly
depleted
on
account
of
his
master
eccentric
views
as
regarded
women
but
he
still
lived
in
hope
and
delighting
in
intrigue
as
every
native
does
had
welcomed
the
advent
of
his
ebony
brother
primed
with
gossip
and
suggestion
therefore
upon
the
beating
of
the
gong
which
had
not
been
struck
for
many
weary
moons
he
hastened
to
the
court
and
salaamed
to
the
ground
before
his
master
who
sat
upon
a
pile
of
cushions
guarded
by
the
two
shaggy
dogs
of
billi
with
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
the
between
his
lips
and
the
falcon
upon
a
padded
perch
beside
him
bring
me
a
woman
to
dance
he
curtly
ordered
and
the
slave
sped
to
do
his
bidding
with
visions
of
a
big
increase
in
the
hidden
in
a
secret
place
and
when
the
dancer
drifted
in
like
a
upon
a
breeze
hugh
carden
ali
looked
up
slowly
letting
escape
a
wisp
of
smoke
from
between
his
lips
the
dancer
wore
one
single
garment
of
transparent
black
hung
from
the
shoulders
by
diamond
bands
and
through
which
her
perfectly
nude
body
shone
like
an
ivory
pillar
her
slender
feet
with
crimsoned
toes
and
heels
were
bare
the
tiny
hands
ablaze
with
jewels
a
huge
bunch
of
osprey
was
fastened
in
her
hair
across
her
face
there
hung
a
short
almost
transparent
veil
one
corner
of
which
she
held
between
her
teeth
leaving
to
view
the
wonderful
eyes
a
heaven
or
hell
of
invitation
as
you
will
she
danced
as
had
danced
her
biblical
sister
to
the
pleasing
of
a
king
for
the
attainment
of
her
desire
and
she
danced
humming
a
little
tune
behind
the
veil
until
the
movement
of
her
beautiful
body
and
the
knowledge
of
a
man
eyes
upon
her
went
to
her
head
like
wine
so
that
in
the
end
by
force
of
habit
maybe
she
danced
to
conquer
where
she
had
only
intended
to
interest
as
already
mentioned
she
had
the
morals
of
a
jackal
she
drifted
down
the
court
towards
hugh
carden
ali
and
standing
before
him
bowed
her
beautiful
head
to
the
level
of
her
dimpled
knees
laughed
gently
and
was
gone
like
a
bird
to
a
far
corner
of
the
court
she
seemed
to
swing
in
the
air
like
a
lime
flower
caught
on
the
end
of
a
spider
thread
as
she
came
slowly
down
once
more
to
be
blown
hither
and
thither
like
a
leaf
before
the
gale
as
she
ran
here
sprang
there
to
the
rhythm
of
the
little
tune
she
hummed
behind
the
wisp
of
veil
to
undulate
like
a
field
of
ripe
wheat
beneath
the
summer
sun
as
she
stood
quite
near
the
man
who
watched
her
with
a
fraction
of
the
interest
he
would
have
shown
in
the
purchase
of
a
dog
or
falcon
in
the
open
mart
her
henna
toes
pressed
firmly
on
the
centre
of
a
persian
rug
of
such
antiquity
as
to
render
the
pattern
indecipherable
she
moved
her
body
from
the
slender
waist
downward
not
at
all
the
muscles
of
her
arms
and
shoulders
rippled
and
her
head
moved
slightly
but
unceasingly
from
side
to
side
how
often
one
hears
of
the
european
boredom
whilst
watching
the
nautch
dance
in
which
the
indian
nautch
girl
fully
clothed
indeed
in
high
tight
bodice
and
voluminous
skirt
will
drive
her
native
audience
clean
crazy
with
the
tapping
of
her
feet
and
slight
undulating
movements
of
the
slender
body
and
arms
it
is
indeed
the
dullest
thing
on
earth
to
watch
if
you
are
unable
to
follow
and
every
little
movement
but
if
you
can
well
the
unexpurgated
version
of
the
arabian
nights
will
be
as
compared
to
the
heady
brew
offered
for
your
consumption
and
the
old
harrovian
sitting
upon
a
heap
of
cushions
with
the
smoke
of
the
drifting
from
between
his
lips
smiled
as
he
picked
up
the
thread
of
the
same
old
story
which
had
been
spun
for
him
when
an
arrogant
youth
of
twelve
summers
he
had
ruled
his
house
with
no
gentle
hand
otherwise
he
showed
little
interest
and
felt
no
desire
to
lift
the
tantalising
veil
neither
did
he
turn
his
head
else
might
he
have
seen
the
ebony
face
of
the
ethiopian
eunuch
peering
from
between
a
mass
of
flowers
from
which
point
of
vantage
he
watched
the
scene
with
intent
to
report
thereon
to
his
black
at
last
and
very
slowly
and
with
a
growing
feeling
of
resentment
in
the
place
where
her
heart
by
rights
should
have
been
zulannah
sped
down
the
court
upon
her
toes
and
fell
at
the
edge
of
the
piled
cushions
causing
the
dogs
to
growl
softly
at
her
daring
thou
art
a
beautiful
dancer
woman
said
hugh
carden
ali
making
no
movement
to
lift
the
veil
behold
i
have
passed
a
pleasant
hour
and
would
reward
thee
what
thou
wilt
money
jewels
speak
from
behind
the
wisp
of
veil
which
fluttered
in
the
dancer
quick
breathing
came
the
barely
whispered
answer
i
hear
thee
not
woman
raise
thy
voice
and
be
not
afraid
i
will
give
thee
what
thou
desirest
one
hour
the
man
bent
forward
to
catch
the
words
and
when
their
full
import
struck
him
leapt
to
his
feet
and
catching
the
woman
wrist
jerked
her
upright
ripping
the
veil
from
before
her
face
he
cried
and
sprang
back
having
heard
of
the
deft
handling
of
her
dagger
when
in
the
tantrums
then
he
caught
both
wrists
and
held
her
pinioned
looking
with
loathing
into
the
exquisite
furious
face
whilst
the
great
dogs
fangs
bared
ruffs
upstanding
sniffed
suspiciously
at
the
knees
and
waist
even
rising
on
their
to
snuff
the
slender
neck
of
this
woman
who
had
angered
their
master
for
a
second
he
held
her
with
arms
stretched
to
and
henna
toes
barely
touching
the
ground
then
threw
her
across
the
cushions
whilst
the
dogs
growled
softly
as
they
prowled
belly
to
ground
about
the
prostrate
figure
and
the
eunuch
tore
at
his
woolly
hirsute
covering
amongst
the
flowers
but
courtesans
have
tears
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
women
and
they
use
them
every
whit
as
effectively
perhaps
a
bit
better
on
account
of
the
stoutness
of
their
hearts
so
that
when
the
man
ordered
the
woman
to
sit
up
she
sat
up
wiped
real
tears
from
the
eyes
her
garments
and
prepared
for
battle
tough
might
describe
the
epidermis
of
the
scarlet
enchantress
thou
hast
a
great
daring
woman
the
courtesan
knew
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
hesitation
and
was
off
with
the
desire
and
on
with
her
original
business
between
the
tossing
and
falling
of
a
drop
from
the
perfumed
fountain
and
ready
with
an
explanation
even
before
the
man
spoke
thou
hast
misheard
my
words
lord
knowing
by
hearsay
of
thy
hatred
of
women
i
entered
thy
house
as
dancer
before
thee
to
gain
as
my
reward
one
hour
of
speech
with
thee
speech
wherefore
because
i
would
help
thee
and
in
helping
thee
help
myself
clasping
her
slender
jewelled
hands
across
her
bosom
she
looked
up
to
the
gilded
ceiling
and
sighing
softly
whispered
i
love
yea
lord
i
love
and
thou
lovest
and
nay
hear
me
it
is
for
thy
advancement
and
mine
and
he
the
man
for
whom
my
soul
has
turned
to
water
for
whom
i
yearn
yea
if
it
be
but
for
one
single
hour
of
his
love
a
memory
of
in
the
of
my
years
he
she
stopped
is
wise
to
approach
a
wounded
tiger
warily
especially
if
you
are
not
certain
as
to
the
extent
of
the
hurt
or
the
power
of

in

and
speak

for
i
would
have
thee
gone
the
man
spoke
curtly
as
he
sank
upon
a
pile
of
cushions
and
pointed
to
one
on
the
far
side
of
the
persian
rug
upon
which
the
most
courted
woman
in
egypt
knelt
with
her
eyes
full
of
gentleness
and
her
heart
pounding
in
a
torment
of
rage
and
fear
yea
i
understand
hugh
carden
ali
spoke
wearily
being
stricken
with
love
for
ten
solid
minutes
the
woman
had
talked
round
her
subject
intuitive
she
scented
danger
usually
fearless
her
whole
being
was
sick
with
apprehension
desperate
she
dug
her
nails
into
her
flesh
and
essayed
to
reach
her
goal
by
a
roundabout
way
then
she
stopped
sighed
and
cast
down
her
eyes
then
raised
them
beseechingly
when
the
man
spoke
fearing
to
use
force
against
the
the
woman
who
thou
sayest
is
loved
by
the
man
thou
lovest
and
may
the
prophet
bear
witness
that
thy
tale
is
as
full
of
turnings
and
twistings
as
the
paths
in
the
bazaar
in
which
thou
thy
web
thou
tear
her
from
him
by
craft
explain
thy
seemingly
futile
words
and
hasten
thy
lying
tongue
for
behold
the
hour
of
dawn
approacheth
and
the
wrath
in
the
voice
was
such
as
to
hurl
the
woman
over
the
cliff
of
discretion
down
into
the
depths
of
her
own
undoing
she
the
white
woman
walks
in
the
bazaar
yea
even
at
noon
and
at
sunset
perchance
one
evening
lured
by
the
tale
of
the
riches
of
the
house
of
zulannah
might
not
her
feet
stray
within
the
portals
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
behold
the
key
of
the
great
door
is
within
these
hands
and
and
the
man
hands
lay
quietly
on
his
knees
as
he
leant
forward
and
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
flowering
plants
hid
the
twin
pools
of
murder
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
and
he
whispered
and
she
whispered
back
would
the
white
man
thinkest
thou
take
to
wife
her
who
had
passed
a
night
in
the
house
of
the
courtesan
would
he
not
without
waiting
for
explanation
throw
her
into
the
filth
of
the
bazaar
leaving
her
for
the
first
comer
to
pick
up
and
turn
himself
to
she
leapt
to
her
feet
screaming
as
his
fingers
closed
round
her
wrist
in
a
grip
of
steel
mad
with
fury
she
tore
her
raiment
and
hair
raving
obscenities
in
the
vilest
language
of
the
lowest
reaches
of
the
bazaar
oblivious
of
the
dogs
which
reared
and
fell
and
reared
unceasingly
behind
her
the
white
woman
who
trapeses
the
bazaar
unveiled
she
screamed
the
white
virgin
who
flung
herself

thy
arms

the

ali
the
son
of
his
father
to
the
part
of
his
being
in
the
horrible
scene
had
made
one
little
sign
and
the
dogs
were
upon
her
with
a
sickening
scrunch
one
caught
the
side
of
her
head
in
the
steel
jaws
which
stretched
from
the
nape
of
the
neck
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
with
a
sharp
snap
the
other
drove
its
fangs
into
the
muscle
behind
the
dimpled
knee
they
pulled
her
down
and
stood
as
these
dogs
are
trained
to
do
then
with
crimson
saliva
dripping
from
the
jaws
crimson
lights
shining
in
the
eyes
let
go
their
hold
and
stood
looking
alternately
from
master
to
quarry
with
slowly
wagging
tails
there
was
no
sign
of
anger
in
the
man
as
he
sat
tranquilly
upon
the
cushions
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
the
between
his
lips
no
sound
of
wrath
in
the
gentle
voice
which
bid
the
ethiopian
eunuch
to
remain
prostrated
upon
the
floor
until
the
arrival
of
the
other
slaves
who
could
be
heard
pelting
through
the
house
from
every
direction
in
answer
to
the
summons
of
the
gong

he
said
quietly
to
four
of
the
domestic
staff
pointing
to
the
eunuch
upon
the
soles
of
the
feet
so
that
he
walketh
not
for
many
a
day
if
ever
and
as
the
wretch
was
dragged
screaming
from
the
room
he
beckoned
to
four
others
and
pointed
to
the
body
of
the
woman

that

and

it
in

down

turned
to

the
little
old
lady
sat
at
her
window
taking
her
hour
of
rest
her
hour
of
understanding
with
hands
clasped
peacefully
in

lap
a
little
smile
at
the
corner

her
whimsical
mouth

her

fluttered
by

she
was

from

confined
by
priceless

just
as
she
had
thrown
aside
the
thoughts
and
worries
which
are
the
outcome
of
the
turmoil
and
unrest
of
civilisation
to
sit
awhile
quietly
with

eyes
upon
the
dazzling

which
show
so
clearly
when
we
push
aside
the
nightmare
fog
we
have
wrapped
about
ourselves
not
for
her
own
relief
did
she
sit
at
rest
for
in
that
way
rest
does
not
come
to
us
but
to
the
relieving
of
others
by
withdrawing
from
the
lights
and
noises
of
this
tumultuous
planet
and
so
obtaining
a
better
perspective
of
things
as
they
stand
spiritually
and
a
clearer
insight
into
the
message
of
the
only
book
she
considered
worth
studying
and
committing
to
memory
she
was
no
great
thinker
this
little
old
lady
neither
did
she
store
up
the
printed
thoughts
of
others
to
repeat
them
aptly
upon
fitting
occasions
she
invariably
mixed
up
the
philosophers
and
their
works
simply
bewildered
her
ritual
left
her
cold
psychology
troubled
her
but
little
save
only
in
its
practical
application
to
the
lives
of
those
she
loved
but
she
knew
the
book
of
life
with
its
tragedies
and
comedies
humour
and
crass
stupidity
nettles
and
balm
from
the
first
chapter
to
the
last
and
could
prescribe
you
a
remedy
to
cure
your
mental
hurt
just
as
easily
as
she
could
undress
your
screaming
baby
find
the
criminal
pin
and
it
for
you
and
every
member
of
every
church
and
every
disciple
of
every
creed
could
have
fought
a
pitched
battle
at
her
feet
and
left
her
unmoved
so
long
as
the
sick
and
sinning
crept
to
her
for
help
and
children
rich
or
poor
in
silks
or
rags
rushed
at
her
coming
to
cling
about
her
knees
she
had
no
fixed
time
for
her
hour
of
understanding
at
her
window
in
moonlight

or
the
coming
of
the
dawn
in
her
gilded
armchair
in
the
firelight
or
the
light
of
the
sun
in
her
in
her
parks
anywhere
as
long
as
she
was
withdrawn
from
noise
and
strife
not
that
she
did
not
thoroughly
enjoy
going
out
to
battle
upon
the
most
mundane
of
material
planes
a
born
fighter
she
would
plunge
into
the
strife
for
the
sheer
love
of
fighting
and
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
or
the
man
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
lay
about
her
right
heartily
with
her
stout
ebony
stick
backed
by
verbal
blows
from
her
vitriolic
tongue
well
if
we
all
rested
for
one
hour
even
for
one
minute
out
of
the
during
the
frantic
passing
of
modern
days
what
a
boon
we
should
grant
our
neighbours
and
as
the
duchess
sat
quietly
with
dekko
the
parrot
fast
asleep
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
as
becomes
a
bird
fate
crept
up
behind
and
dropped
the
black
thread
of
hate
and
the
purple
thread
of
grief
amongst
the
others
she
had
tossed
into
the
old
lady
lap
she
suddenly
sat
upright
with
a
shiver
qatim
the
ethiopian
lifted
the
body
of
a
woman
from
out
the
gutter
and
the
messenger
from
the
oasis
of
khargegh
strode
through
the
gateway
of
the
hotel
and
kicked
the
somnolent
or
watchman
who
coughed
discreetly
behind
the
sleeping
back
and
when
hobson
some
time
later
entered
the
bedroom
with
her
early
cup
of
tea
which
included
an
egg
and
fruit
she
said
nothing
of
the
terrible
story
which
had
run
like
wildfire
through
the
quarters
and
had
turned
her
cold
with
horror
hobson
was
an
autocrat
in
her
own
domain
and
ruled
with
a
rod
do
you
utter
one
word
of
this
disgusting
tale
to
her
grace
she
had
said
fiercely
as
she
had
sailed
through
the
door
of
the
room
held
meekly
open
for
her
by
one
of
the
who
had
been
caught
gossiping
or
back
you
go
to
england
both
of
you
she
turned
back
into
the
room
and
rattled
the
tray
to
emphasise
her
orders
i
wo
have
my
lady
troubled
with
it
hear
common
circus
trash
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
you
i
should
like
to
know
if
she
been
killed
or
not
that
what
they
all
come
to
as
you
find
out
if
you
do
take
care
she
had
swept
from
the
room
leaving
the
plump
devonshire
lasses
trembling
many
many
years
ago
the
duchess
had
taken
the
bright
intelligent
daughter
of
a
devonshire
farmer
on
the
estate
into
her
service
trained
her
and
promoted
her
as
her
seniors
in
the
lady
service
had
married
or
been
pensioned
off
until
she
had
finally
risen
to
the
post
of
head
maid
and
confidential
companion
love
and
marriage
had
passed
maria
hobson
by
but
she
adored
her
mistress
and
constituted
herself
as
dragon
and
buffer
so
as
to
save
her
from
unpleasantness
or
pain
at
the
same
time
issuing
orders
as
to
health
and
hours
which
her
grace
usually
meekly
obeyed
though
you
would
not
have
taken
a
bet
upon
it
with
any
feeling
of
security
it
is
curious
the
ascendancy
which
such
a
type
of
maid
can
obtain
over
a
mistress
think
of
abigail
hill
and
the
influence
she
had
over
queen
anne
which
finally
ousted
the
great
sarah
jennings
duchess
of
marlborough
brought
disturbance
into
english
politics
and
ruin
to
the
fortune
of
the
jacobites
but
at
times
there
was
a
look
in
her
mistress
eyes
and
a
certain
atmosphere
radiating
from
the
frail
little
person
before
which
hobson
quailed
so
that
she
said
quite
gently
tea
and
one
letter
your
grace
when
she
found
her
sitting
at
the
open
window
looking
out
at
the
morning
sky
but
although
she
spoke
gently
and
tucked
an
extra
shawl
about
the
bent
shoulders
with
a
tender
hand
she
was
thinking
viciously
all
the
same
over
her
mistresses
leniency
towards
her
i
wish
the
young
lady
could
be
safely
married
to
that
proper
english
gentleman
one
can
see
he
wants
her
but
she
does
seem
to
know
her
own
mind
too
pleased
by
half
she
is
to
my
thinking
with
this
country
and
the
silly
nonsense
of
their
nasty
heathen
ways
and
she
left
the
room
with
a
swish
of
starched
petticoat
when
damaris
who
had
just
returned
from
her
desert
ride
entered
to
greet
her
godmother
she
knelt
at
the
side
of
the
chair
and
encircling
her
in
her
strong
young
arms
laid
her
cheek
against
the
old
lady
and
knelt
without
movement
looking
out
to
the
desert
whilst
one
wrinkled
old
hand
stroked
her
head
and
the
other
turned
the
pages
of
the
letter
a
piteous
letter
of
appeal
from
a
woman
whose
love
had
brought
forth
the
bitterest
of
bitter
fruit
there
a
way
out
petite
wrote
jill
the
english
wife
of
hahmed
sheikh
will
you
undertake
the
long
journey
and
come
and
see
me
for
who
knows
if
together
we
could
not
find
a
way
to
ensure
my
boy
happiness
i
would
come
to
you
only
hugh
is
near
you
and
our
men
in
the
east
tolerate
no
interference
from
their
my
messenger
will
wait
for
your
answer
i
am
overwhelmed
with
foreboding
for
hugh
my
if
you
can
come
to
me
jill
and
as
the
sun
rose
the
old
lady
still
sat
near
the
window
trying
to
come
to
a
decision
could
she
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
woman
she
had
known
as
a
girl
almost
years
ago
could
she
on
the
other
hand
go
to
her
and
risk
leaving
the
girl
at
her
side
exposed
to
the
indescribable
appeal
of
the
east
should
she
send
her
back
to
england
or
take
her
as
far
as
luxor
and
leave
her
there
under
the
social
wing
of
lady
thistleton
have
you
learned
any
more
about
the
arab
who
follows
at
a
distance
when
you
ride
in
the
morning
dear
damaris
nodded
it
seemed
she
had
overheard
lady
thistleton
talking
about
him
his
palaces
in
the
desert
and
at
cairo
his
stables
and
falcons
the
girl
stopped
for
a
moment
then
continued
he
has
an
english
name
and
seems
to
be
a
millionaire
and
something
else
which
i
could
not
catch
but
by
the
sound
of
the
voice
it
seemed
to
be
something
awful
this
the
old
lady
touched
the
letter
in
her
lap
this
is
from
his
mother
dear
asking
me
to
go
and
see
her
if
i
do
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
when
i
come
back
do
ask
me
anything
until
then
dear
silence
fell
between
them
as
the
hotel
woke
to
another
sunlit
day
something
will
happen
to
decide
me
mused
the
old
lady
as
a
little
later
she
took
her
mail
from
hobson
who
moved
majestically
about
the
room
with
and
towels
from
ben
she
continued
flicking
a
lightning
glance
at
the
face
which
went
suddenly
rosy
pink
as
it
rested
against
her
knee
written
from
the
oasis
of
kurkur
near
the
first
cataract
he
has

but
has
heard
a
lot
about

is
causing

panic
amongst

oh
how
nice
for
him
do
you
remember
fat
sybil
sidmouth
the
crack
shot
it
seemed
that
jolly
sybil
sidmouth
well
known
at
bisley
and
who
had
brought
a
thin
stepmother
devastated
with
nerves
to
winter
in
luxor
had
also
fallen
a
victim
to
lion
gossip
and
had
wired
a
bet
to
ben
kelham
that
she
would
bring
in
the
lion

are
meeting
at
assouan
to
discuss

yes
said
damaris
indifferently
and
added
vindictively
knocking
about
in
the
desert
might
reduce
her
a
bit
and
gave
no
thought
to
the
moment
of
that
very
morning
when
under
some
uncontrollable
impulse
she
had
turned
the
stallion
sooltan
and
taken
him
back
at
full
gallop
and
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
arab
who
in
european
and
boots
from
peter
yapp
had
raised
his
right
hand
as
she
had
thundered
past
standing
in
her
stirrups
a
woman
could
keep
a
till
the
last
trump
and
even
then
never
awake
to
the
fact
that
the
same
brand
of
corn
is
appreciated
both
by
the
goose
and
the
gander
and
sure
enough
something
happened
to
decide
her

were
just
returning
from

and
were
negotiating
the

when
a
native
policeman
waving
his
arm
like
a
semaphore
stepped
into
the
stream
of
traffic
resulted
the
usual
maelstrom
of
motors
native
vehicles
stray
animals
and
trams
in
which
tossed
the
native
pedestrian
as
agile
and
vociferous

slipped
in

out

loudly

was

then
blushed
divinely

there
was
one
gorgeous
mounted

in

which
came
whirling
across

in

seen

on

almost
bursting
with
importance
came
a
persian
deftly
carrying
the

a
kind
of
padded
stand
upon
which
hooded
and
fastened
by

couple
of
waving
the

ran
shouting
before

surrounded
the

armed
with

they
rattled
with

effect
upon

interchanged

watched

urge
the

picked
a
dainty
path
through
the
wondering
crowds
which
opened
a
way
before

the
sun
caught
the
jewels
on
the
man
breast
and
above
his
turban
and
upon
the
of
the

and
struck
fiercely
slantwise
into
the
proud
handsome
face
with
the
set
mouth
and
the
eyes
which
never
once
looked
in
the
englishwomen

for
a
full
minute
he
sat
immovable
whilst
the
mare
freed
from
the
fret
of
the
crowd
stood
in
his
bearing
in
the
magnificent
picture
he
made
under
the
flaming
skies
there
seemed
a
subtle
challenge
to
the
two
englishwomen
all
his
english
nature
rose
in
revolt
against
the
barriers
that
rose
between
himself
and
damaris
daughter
of
his
mother
race
but
curbing
his
passion
with
the
he
had
learned
in
british
fields
of
sport
he
remembered
that
he
belonged
primarily
to
his
father
land
whose
people
had
three
thousand
years
before
held
the
keys
of
civilisation
in
their
powerful
hands
whilst
the
people
of
his
mother
land
were
just
about
emerging
from
the
primitiveness
of
the
stone
age
am
the
he
seemed
to
cry
in
his
utter
immobility
then
he
turned
beckoned
and
gave
a
sharp
order
to
the
bewildered
policeman
who
salaamed
almost
to
the
ground
hugh
carden
ali
bowed
to
the
saddle
as
the
great
car
shot
smoothly
forward
there
was
a
smile
of
welcome
on
the
face
of
the
old
woman
who
had
loved
his
mother
a
whole
world
of
welcome
in
the
outstretched
hand
and
a
little
feeling
of
thankfulness
in
her
heart
that
at
last
she
might
get
to
know
the
man
in
time
and
with
him
go
to
visit
his
mother
or
better
still
win
his
confidence
heal
his
hurt
and
so
obviate
the
tedious
journey
but
there
was
to
be
no
drawing
together
of
the
man
wound
with
the
silken
threads
of
sympathy
he
sat
like
a
statue
with
his
left
hand
raised
in
salute
until
the
englishwomen
had
passed
then
throwing
his
falcon
he
watched
the
confused
bird
flight
in
search
of
the
quarry
which
was
not
there

down

the
old
lady
going
in

came
to

he
is
best
he
is
little
worse
than
a
man
and
when
he
is
worst
he
is
little
better
than
a
shakespeare
even
as
the
frail
little
old
lady
sat
quietly
looking
out
at
the
coming
of
the
dawn
qatim
the
ethiopian
sat
looking
with
pride
round
his
transformed
hovel
in
the
back
reaches
of
the
bazaar
having
gathered
zulannah
from
the
gutter
where
she
had
been
thrown
after
the
dogs
had
pulled
her
down
he
carried
her
to
his
hovel
and
believing
her
to
be
dead
flung
her
body
on
the
heap
of
filthy
straw
which
served
him
as
couch
and
then
stole
back
in
fact
six
times
he
made
the
journey
to
the
courtesan
great
house
he
did
not
argue
with
himself
he
had
no
theories
and
most
certainly
no
moral
standards
the
woman
was
dead
there
were
certain
things
beautiful
gaudy
glittering
things
in
her
house
which
his
heart
had
always
coveted
which
had
made
his
fingers
to
itch
and
his
mouth
to
water
brute
instinct
told
him
to
seize
the
bones
before
the
other
dogs
fell
upon
them
and
he
obeyed
the
brutish
impulse
hundreds
of
soft
silken
gowns
cushions
of
every
hue
the
great
crimson
cover
from
off
the
divan
all
of
these
he
made
into
a
huge
bundle
which
he
carried
to
his
den
the
gold
and
jewelled
toilet
accessories
the
silver
basin
and
ewer
just
because
they
glittered
he
tied
in
a
pair
of
emerald
green
satin
curtains
various
strange
knives
and
things
with
prongs
with
which
on
certain
occasions
the
courtesan
had
conveyed
food
to
her
mouth
she
used
her
fingers
in
private
with
a
of
marvellous
workmanship
he
rolled
up
in
a
bright
yellow
and
green
kidderminster
carpet
on
his
fifth
journey
he
carried
a
small
milner
safe
upon
his
back
letting
it
drop
gently
upon
the
hovel
floor
without
the
slightest
acceleration
in
his
breathing
for
five
minutes
he
played
with
the
knob
like
a
huge
monkey
then
grinned
rubbed
his
chest
and
with
straw
and
padded
off
again
down
the
circuitous
streets
at
a
gentle
trot
he
looked
at
the
sky
and
at
the
closed
doors
and
windows
of
the
packed
houses
and
grinned
again
he
could
not
tell
the
hour
by
a
clock
but
he
knew
to
a
second
when
the
first
of
the
seething
mass
of
humans
asleep
on
the
beds
and
floors
and
stairs
of
the
packed
houses
would
yawn
rub
the
sleep
from
their
eyes
and
stumble
shivering
into
the
street
he
had
still
his
greatest
treasure
to
bring
and
had
no
wish
to
be
caught
with
it
on
his
back
not
because
of
the
criminality
of
his
proceedings
that
never
once
entered
his
thick
skull
but
because
he
was
scared
of
having
the
mirror
reft
from
him
he
was
almost
devoid
of
brain
but
had
a
certain
animal
instinct
which
served
him
in
good
stead
and
which
in
this
instance
urged
him
to
keep
his
part
in
the
history
of
the
past
evening
to
himself
he
picked
up
the
mirror
as
though
it
had
been
a
small
picture
and
stood
for
an
instant
grinning
cheerfully
looking
round
the
room
in
which
his
mistress
had
so
often
kicked
and
threatened
him
then
he
gave
a
little
click
at
the
back
of
his
throat
placed
the
mirror
on
the
floor
and
stole
across
the
persian
carpet
of
an
unknown
antiquity
and
value
to
a
painted
deal
writing
desk
which
had
once
reposed
in
a
shop
window
in
westbourne
grove
and
which
on
account
of
its
little
drawers
and
little
cupboards
with
painted
doors
had
given
intense
joy
to
the
woman
whose
wealth
in
hard
cash
in
the
bank
and
jewels
in
the
safe
was
almost
incredible
he
lifted
the
slanting
lid
moved
a
bundle
of
papers
fastened
by
an
elastic
band
and
pulled
out
a
drawer
out
of
which
be
took
a
he
had
no
idea
of
the
real
use
of
the
book
with
the
buff
cover
and
pale
pink
leaves
but
he
knew
that
you
had
only
to
make
certain
black
marks
on
one
of
the
pink
leaves
and
take
it
to
the
big
house
in
the
sharia
clot
bey
with
its
fierce
man
standing
in
front
of
the
door
and
money
would
be
given
in
exchange
on
account
of
his
cunning
his
stolidity
his
mighty
muscle
and
ferocious
appearance
qatim
had
been
made
in
chief
to
the
house
of
zulannah
and
had
often
stood
at
his
mistress
side
when
she
had
taken
the
from
the
drawer
and
made
strange
black
marks
on
one
of
the
pink
leaves
true
he
had
rolled
his
eyes
and
shown
his
teeth
fiercely
many
a
time
at
the
interpreter
who
had
had
to
be
called
to
explain
that
although
he
had
handed
a
pink
leaf
through
the
bars
there
was
no
money
forthcoming
but
as
his
mistress
had
not
struck
him
for
returning
he
had
resigned
himself
at
last
to
the
strangeness
of
the
proceedings
the
book
meant
money
that
was
all
he
knew
so
he
slipped
it
into
his
as
had
been
his
rather
distressing
habit
when
handed
a
bundle
of
notes
by
the
who
with
his
had
never
tired
of
gazing
at
the
gigantic
creature
in
white
shorts
crimson
tunic
huge
turban
and
rattling
scimitar
he
gave
no
thought
to
the
dead
body
on
the
filthy
straw
that
he
knew
he
could
carry
under
his
arm
and
drop
into
the
nile
when
the
bazaar
slept
but
he
pulled
hard
at
his
curly
hair
as
a
plan
germinated
in
the
sluggish
convolutions
of
his
brain
it
was
a
very
vague
and
a
very
childlike
plan
but
too
much
could
not
be
expected
from
one
who
had
been
conceived
born
and
bred
on
the
animal
plane
after
an
hour
pondering
it
however
took
a
fairly
definite
outline
when
the
sun
had
warmed
the
cool
wind
of
night
he
would
hide
the
body
under
the
straw
and
visit
his
eunuch
twin
who
had
really
been
the
cause
of
the
disaster
his
silence
would
have
to
be
bought
of
course
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
broken
his
neck
at
once
but
it
was
too
late
now
so
there
was
no
use
in
worrying
then
he
would
go
terrorise
the
servants
giving
them
to
understand
that
he
had
been
left
in
charge
in
his
mistress
absence
he
would
remain
in
charge
until
he
had
acquired
enough
money
to
buy
the
little
venus
who
worked
in
the
shoemakers
bazaar
after
that
he
would
creep
away
with
her
and
return
to
his
own
village
further
down
the
nile
and
because
perhaps
of
the
childishness
of
the
plan
it
succeeded
up
to
a
certain
point
he
found
his
eunuch
brother
who
was
the
only
one
besides
his
master
and
himself
to
know
that
the
dancer
had
been
zulannah
in
the
grip
of
such
terror
and
physical
pain
as
to
be
almost
imbecile
though
a
look
of
cunning
had
shone
for
a
moment
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
when
qatim
had
inadvertently
let
drop
a
hint
as
to
the
accumulated
riches
in
his
hovel
anyway
they
came
to
an
understanding
which
ensured
the
silence
at
the
price
of
so
much
good
money
paid
in
instalments
qatim
had
no
intention
of
holding
to
his
side
of
the
agreement
nor
his
brother
to
his
as
is
the
way
of
such
breed
of
oriental
then
just
as
he
was
clad
only
in
and
with
whip
in
hand
the
gigantic
brute
strode
to
the
house
of
zulannah
ensued
a
turbulent
hour
at
the
end
of
which
he
remained
acknowledged
master
of
the
house
and
inmates
until
the
return
of
the
mistress
whilst
those
who
had
mocked
him
went
in
search
of
cool
leaves
to
place
upon
the
bruised
portion
of
their
backs
and
those
two
whose
heads
he
had
cracked
together
for
having
resisted
him
lay
quite
still
returned
to
the
hovel
as
the
sun
was
sinking
and
in
high
fettle
he
donned
red
tunic
huge
turban
and
rattling
scimitar
and
strutted
with
all
the
negro
delight
in
fine
feathers
in
front
of
the
mirror
which
rested
against
the
crumbling
plaster
walls
and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
stared
into
the
glass
the
filthy
straw
in
the
corner
of
the
room
had
moved
his
face
went
grey
great
beads
of
sweat
showed
upon
his
chest
his
knees
shook
then
he
fell
on
his
face
and
covered
his
head
with
a
corner
of
the
kidderminster
carpet
when
a
voice
feebly
craved
for
water
and
a
small
hand
weakly
pulled
at
the
straw
zulannah
was
not
dead
he
lay
for
some
long
time
then
slowly
got
to
his
knees
tore
off
the
fine
feathers
and
flung
the
scimitar
into
a
far
corner
then
naked
save
for
the
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
straw
and
pulled
at
his
curly
oiled
hair
a
sure
sign
in
him
of
deep
thought
then
he
grinned
and
rising
walked
across
the
floor
and
sitting
down
again
pulled
the
woman
from
under
the
straw
no
zulannah
was
not
dead
nor
even
fatally
hurt
but
she
was
horrible
to
look
upon
when
the
ethiopian
had
washed
her
clean
by
means
of
a
handful
of
straw
dipped
in
a
broken
pitcher
of
water
the
dog
great
fangs
had
driven
behind
the
ear
severing
the
mastoid
nerve
so
that
the
mouth
was
pulled
right
up
the
left
side
of
the
face
it
had
also
injured
the
muscle
controlling
the
eyelid
causing
it
to
droop
and
giving
a
diabolical
leer
to
the
once
beautiful
eye
it
had
also
injured
the
muscle
of
the
neck
so
that
the
head
was
slightly
twisted
but
worst
of
all
the
other
dog
had
driven
its
terrible
fangs
into
the
muscle
above
the
knees
injuring
it
so
that
she
would
never
walk
straight
again
and
qatim
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
laughed
clapping
his
enormous
hands
she
was
not
dead
and
her
hands
were
not
injured
but
she
was
too
hideous
to
show
herself
unveiled
and
too
twisted
to
be
recognised
in
the
street
so
all
that
was
left
to
him
to
do
was
to
cure
her
injuries
which
he
did
and
quickly
under
the
advice
of
an
old
herbalist
in
the
silk
market
and
then
sit
down
for
the
rest
of
his
life
whilst
she
drew
strange
little
marks
on
those
pale
pink
leaves

old
aristocrat
as
a
key
to
the
door
which
was
locked
fast
between
himself
and
the
girl
he
loved
after
all
such
marriages
taken
place
thousands
of
them
so
why
should
not
his
with
the
beautiful
girl
be
added
to
the
list
the
outcome
thereof
proving
the
proverbial
exception
to
the
inevitable
disastrous
ending
of
all
such
unions
why
did
he
deny
himself
just
because
he
loved
the
girl
with
the
same
love
his
white
mother
had
given
his
arabian
father
if
it
had
been
otherwise
with
never
a
second
thought
he
would
have
lifted
the
girl
as
doubtlessly
his
ancestors
had
lifted
women
in
their
or
raids
and
left
the
consequences
in
the
hands
of
that
old
beldame
fate
so
it
had
been
decided
to
start
the
day
after
the
morrow
by
private
and
swiftest
to
luxor
where
damaris
shepherded
by
jane
coop
and
under
the
social
wing
of
lady
thistleton
would
sojourn
at
the
winter
palace
hotel
until
such
time
as
her
godmother
should
see
fit
to
return
from
her
errand
of
mercy
to
the
house
mahabbha
in
the
oasis
of
khargegh
thus
whilst
jane
coop
slept
placidly
and
maria
hobson
wrestled
under
the
in
the
last
throes
of
a
nightmare
in
which
as
a
camel
she
packed
parcels
of
sand
wrapped
in
in
trunks
which
stretched
across
an
endless
desert
damaris
drove
out
to
the
obelisk
for
her
last
ride
on
the
stallion
sooltan
she
rode
out
into
the
shadows
the
dawn
having
barely
lifted
the
hem
of
night
purple
raiment
from
the
edge
of
the
world
out
into
the
desert
stretching
soundless
just
stirred
by
the
light
touch
of
the
breeze
which
heralding
the
dawn
sends
little
spirals
of
sand
dancing
away
to
the
east
and
away
to
the
west
and
blows
out
the
stars
one
by
one
and
she
rode
listlessly
knowing
that
no
desert
would
ever
be
as
this
desert
or
dawn
as
this
passing
of
the
night
or
liberty
as
this
hour
of
freedom
in
the
wastes
of
sand
and
then
when
perhaps
ten
perhaps
more
or
less
miles
out
she
pulled
the
stallion
sharply
and
sat
forward
staring
whilst
her
heart
thrilled
in
a
most
unwarrantable
manner
beneath
her
coat
upon
a
hummock
of
sand
with
tattered
robes
of
saffron
purple
and
of
gold
about
his
feet
there
sat
a
youth
sideways
he
sat
with
tips
of
slender
feet
to
ground
as
though
preparatory
to
flight
one
fine
brown
hand
pushed
back
a
misty
veil
before
the
face
which
shone
wanly
in
the
a
strange
dreamy
cruel
face
with
crimson
laughing
mouth
pointed
chin
and
eyes
of
eyes
in
which
the
pupils
never
close
and
which
under
the
shadow
of
the
coarse
black
hair
with
sand
shone
like
twin
pools
of
loneliness
hidden
in
the
rocks
of
time
the
other
hand
outstretched
palm
uppermost
held
between
the
curling
beckoning
fingers
tatters
of
the
veil
which
blown
by
the
wind
twined
about
the
slender
limbs
and
outlined
the
ribbed
ridges
of
the
body
thin
to
gauntness
and
even
as
she
looked
the
hummock
showed
empty
whilst
upon
tips
of
slender
feet
with
beckoning
hand
he
stood
a
mile
off
perchance
more
this
youth
of
crimson
laughing
mouth
and
haunting
eyes
one
with
the
and
purple
of
the
night
one
with
the
gold
and
crimson
of
the
coming
day
he
drew
her
whilst
the
breeze
laughed
over
her
head
and
soughed
faintly
in
her
ears
so
that
she
strove
to
ride
him
down
only
to
find
that
he
was
not
there
and
urged
the
great
beast
further
still
and
at
his
greatest
speed
to
see
the
figure
ever
out
of
reach
with
beckoning
hand
and
little
mocking
laugh
and
then
with
hoofs
clattering
in
the
shining
bones
of
some
fugitive
who
had
failed
to
reach
the
oasis
the
stallion
reared
and
wheeled
and
caring
naught
for
the
hand
upon
the
reins
and
with
the
bit
between
his
teeth
raced
back
upon
his
tracks
leaving
the
spirit
of
the
desert
wrapped
to
the
eyes
in
tattered
misty
veil
take
heed
so
matter
at
what
hour
of
the
day
you
meet
him
be
it
at
the
hour
of
noon
when
the
scorpion
basks
blissfully
in
the
scorching
sun
be
it
at
night
when
the
white
fingers
of
the
moon
essay
to
close
your
eyes
in
the
sleep
that
perchance
may
have
no
waking
or
at
dawn
when
heart
or
soul
or
whatever
it
be
is
like
unto
running
water
in
its
strength
beware
of
that
gaunt
figure
with
crimson
laughing
mouth
men
bewitched
as
with
woman

followed
women
bewitched
as
with
man
have
followed
you
will
find
their
bones
if
you
go
far
enough
or
dig
deep
enough
and
leave
yours
to
bleach
with
theirs
if
you
have
not
strength
to
resist

see
it
not
at
all
so
that
through
a
certain
unromantic
yearning
for
oats
under
his
loosening
girth
the
stallion
sooltan
raced
damaris
back
to
the
and
safety
she
had
not
understood
the
import
of
the
apparition
in
the
desert
any
more
than
she
perceived
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
amongst
the
ruins
watching
her
hugh
carden
ali
knew
that
it
was
her
last
ride
the
last
time
she
would
feed
the
stallion
with
sugar
her
last
day
amongst
the
ruins
of
the
city
of
on
the
blood
of
his
fathers
even
that
of
the
men
who
had
swept
the
desert
for
their
women
warred
with
the
blood
of
his
mother
of
a
gentler
breed
so
that
fearing
the
strength
of
the
one
or
the
weakness
of
the
other
he
had
sacrificed
the
last
ride
to
the
love
in
his
heart

in

if

the

damaris
had
spent
the
last
fortnight
in
helping
her
godmother
prepare
for
her
tedious
journey
with
the
knowledge
that
she
would
have
a
fortnight
perhaps
more
in
which
there
would
be
little
else
to
do
than
to
visit
the
ruins
she
had
rushed
through
the
principal
objects
of
interest
in
the
wake
of
a
verbose
dragoman
and
then
given
every
moment
of
her
time
to
her
beloved
godmother
to
whom
she
had
said
that
very
morning
restless
and
irritated
by
the
trivial
conversation
of
girls
of
her
own
age
and
the
amorous
tendencies
of
the
stronger
sex
of
the
same
age
and
also
a
good
bit
older
she
had
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
hotel
grounds
waiting
for
the
evening
when
she
could
slip
away
by
herself
having
realised
that
the
best
time
of
all
in
thebes
of
the
hundred
gates
is
at
fall
of
night
when
the
shadows
cast
a
seemly
cloak
over
the
vulgarity
of
the
modern
buildings
and
give
an
air
of
romance
even
to
the
glittering
lights
of
the
appalling
esplanade
which
flaunts
its
tawdry
modernity
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
quay
built
by
one
of
the
ptolemies
and
in
use
even
to
the
present
day
when
the
call
of
the
from
the
mosque
of
came
to
her
an
hour
before
sunset
she
went
in
bathed
and
dressed
and
dined
in
her
own
room
later
she
stole
out
ordered
her
car
and
drove
herself
along
the
broad
road
and
up
the
avenue
of
sphinxes
to
the
first
pylon
of
the
great
temple
there
she
switched
off
the
lights
hid
the
under
the
cushions
and
passed
through
the
first
pylon
and
up
to
the
broken
kiosk
of
the
ethiopian
tahraka
she
walked
quietly
though
assuredly
her
footsteps
would
have
been
deadened
by
egypt
sands
even
if
she
had
walked
upon
her
heels
and
stole
through
the
vestibule
to
the
second
pylon
occasionally
switching
on
her
electric
torch
for
fear
of
being
tripped
by
fallen
stone
she
had
not
heard
of
the
great
catastrophe
which
had
brought
the
columns
hurtling
to
the
ground
due
perhaps
to
the
merciless
greed
of
ptolemy
lathyrus
or
earthquake
or
the
fact
that
temples
houses
or
plans
built
upon
sand
are
bound
to
crumble
nor
did
she
wot
of
the
precariousness
of
the
walls
around
her
or
the
shifting
propensities
of
the
foundations
she
walked
quietly
because
the
spirit
of
the
place
was
upon
her
the
spirit
which
puts
a
hand
upon
your
mouth
so
that
words
shall
not
disturb
the
ghosts
of
the
past
and
which
blinds
your
eyes
so
that
you
look
back
upon
that
hour
as
on
a
dream
yet
as
she
passed
through
pylon
vestibule
and
the
great
court
she
stopped
and
turned
went
on
and
stopped
again
to
listen
there
was
no
sound
flashing
her
light
upon
part
of
a
fallen
column
she
sat
down
upon
it
with
the
purple
sky
studded
with
stars
as
roof
above
her
head
and
the
sands
of
ages
as
carpet
to
her
feet
and
as
she
sat
so
still
her
thoughts
turned
to
the
man
who
had
said
he
loved
her
and
who
yet
seemed
so
content
to
leave
her
quite
alone
a
woman
may
refuse
a
man
honest
proposal
of
marriage
and
have
no
intention
whatever
of
marrying
him
even
later
on
but
that
does
not
mean
he
need
necessarily
take
her
at
her
word
to
the
extent
of
retiring
altogether
from
the
horizon
of
her
life
as
for
the
rest
the
flowers
upon
her
her
rides
at
dawn
about
that
she
instinctively
kept
her
thoughts
in
check
it
was
like
the
bottle
of
perfume
which
you
are
not
allowed
to
use
on
account
of
your
youth
the
first
few
lines
of
the
first
novel
you
filched
from
your
mother
that
afternoon
she
was
out
the
first
time
you
put
on
a
real
evening
dress
and
wound
a
fichu
about
your
neck
before
you
opened
your
bedroom
door
and
as
she
sat
there
fell
a
little
sound
bits
of
masonry
as
big
as
a
bowl
or
as
small
as
a
marble
are
quite
likely
to
fall
upon
your
pate
in
colossal
ruins
but
remembering
the
vague
uneasiness
which
had
caused
her
to
stop
and
listen
further
back
she
sat
forward
and
switched
on
her
light
against
the
wall
opposite
her
entirely
robed
in
black
with
a
glittering
jewel
clasping
a
corner
of
the
great
black
mantle
swinging
from
the
shoulders
there
stood
a
man
there
was
no
sign
of
the
paralysing
terror
which
swept
the
girl
her
face
which
had
gone
was
in
shadow
her
hands
under
control
for
a
moment
she
sat
breathless
then
flashed
the
light
full
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
stalked
her
through
the
temple
then
flashed
it
back
to
the
jewel
then
sighed
an
unutterable
sigh
of
relief
the
jewel
was
in
the
shape
of
a
hawk
the
symbol
of
ancient
egypt
just
for
a
moment
they
stayed
in
utter
silence
those
two
who
for
all
we
know
may
have
met
and
parted
in
this
very
spot
in
the
days
of
the
xii
dynasty
to
meet
and
part
and
meet
again
then
she
tackled
the
untoward
situation
in
the
only
possible
way
will
you
as
you
promised
if
the
hour
is
come
tell
me
the
tale
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
she
spoke
sweetly
softly
switching
out
the
light
and
hugh
carden
ali
crossed
the
intervening
square
of
sand
which
however
being
his
heritage
stretched
an
impregnable
barrier
between
them
and
sank
to
the
ground
beside
her
the
perfume
of
her
raiment
was
about
him
the
sound
of
her
breathing
in
his
ears
all
the
love
and
worship
of
his
heart
was
hers
yet
he
merely
lifted
the
hem
of
her
cloak
to
his
lips
the
shadows
pressed
down
upon
them
as
he
spoke
quietly
his
voice
echoing
strangely
in
the
temple
of
the
gods
behold
the
hawk
of
egypt
looked
forth
from
the
shadows
of
the
mountain
fastness
and
nothing
stirred
in
the
earth
or
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
wrong
had
been
wrought
and
the
anger
of
the
gods
was
as
clouds
loosened
from
their
hands
and
behold
as
the
first
pierced
the
fury
of
the
storm
the
mighty
bird
spread
wide
its
wings
which
were
as
of
ruby
and
of
emerald
and
of
onyx
and
of
gold
as
they
glistened
in
the
sun
and
sailed
upon
the
wind
of
the
morning
down
towards
the
plains
and
as
he
passed
glittering
like
a
jewel
in
the
crown
of
osiris
those
of
his
kind
screaming
defiance
spread
their
wings
and
hastened
west
and
east
they
would
have
none
of
him
for
beneath
the
mighty
pinions
showed
the
white
plumage
of
another
race
and
in
the
radiant
light
of
day
there
came
from
the
southern
plains
a
white
bird
crossing
the
hawk
path
as
a
snowflake
driven
by
destiny
across
the
desert
wastes
and
he
encircled
her
lifting
her
upon
the
wind
of
his
great
pinions
higher
higher
yet
towards
the
eyrie
in
the
solitary
mountain
peak
and
as
they
mounted
those
of
his
kind
and
those
of
her
kind
who
had
followed
battled
with
him
for
he
was
outcast
from
the
one
and
the
other
and
the
mist
which
was
the
anger
of
the
gods
closed
down
the
shadows
seemed
to
deepen
as
the
quiet
voice
stopped
and
said
damaris
gently
the
end
that
is
on
the
lap
of
the
gods
i
do
not
understand
she
had
not
caught
the
end
of
lady
thistleton
chatter
else
would
she
have
been
able
to
interpret
the
little
story
and
the
man
who
had
thought
that
his
parents
mixed
marriage
was
a
common
subject
for
gossip
in
the
hotel
which
it
was
sprang
to
his
feet
the
future
still
held
the
moment
when
someone
would
enlighten
her
as
to
the
lowliness
of
his
caste
it
is
late
he
said
gravely
in
english
perhaps
if
you
were
to
ask
at
the
hotel
someone
would
interpret
the
little
tale
and
now
will
you
not
return
for
fear
they
come
in
search
of
you
it
is
not
wise
to
wander
alone
at
night
without
a
companion
your
dog
damaris
laughed
the
echoes
binding
the
silvery
sound
like
a
soft
wrapping
about
the
wounds
and
bruises
time
had
left
upon
the
ruins
wellington
oh
he
cut
his
foot
badly
this
morning
and
i
i
want
to
go
to
the
hall
built
like
a
tent
the
great
festal
hall
of
totmes
iii
the
man
made
no
other
comment
it
was
not
for
him
to
offer
himself
as
dragoman
will
you
take
me
there
if
you
know
the
way
verily
would
i
be
thy
guide
came
the
passionate
reply
to
guard
thy
feet
against
the
stones

yes
indeed
side
by
side
they
walked
the
torch
throwing
a
pool
of
radiance
just
ahead
until
damaris
walked
blindly
into
a
column
and
cried
aloud
from
the
hurt
of
the
stone
against
her
shoulder
it
was
then
that
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
support
and
tingled
to
her
feet
when
sudden
flames
seemed
to
singe
her
as
they
rested
on
the
man
arm
through
the
central
court
and
the
pylons
and
into
the
hall
of
records
they
went
until
she
tripped
and
crashed
to
her
knees
and
rising
slipped
her
hand
into
the
man
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
thudding
heart
when
closing
fiercely
round
hers
it
seemed
to
burn
her
whole
being
hand
in
hand
they
stood
seeing
by
reason
of
the
gloom
vastly
little
of
the
columns
which
have
the
strange
shape
of
then
walked
warily
and
still

in

in
and
out
of
various
and
dilapidated
chambers
i
i
do
to
go
back
but
i
think
it
must
be
very
late
so
they
were
standing
near
the
chapel
with
the
granite
altar
as
she
spoke
and
had
turned
to
retrace
their
way
when
she
flashed
her
light
upon
a
flight
of
steps
strange
is
the
fascination
and
desolation
of
steps
leading
to
an
empty
dwelling
and
almost
as
mysterious
as
the
door
ajar
in
an
empty
house
she
stood
in
the
little
room
and
swept
the
light
across
the
walls
upon
which
are
represented
the
animals
and
flowers
brought
from
syria
century
upon
century
ago
then
the
light
which
had
been
growing
dimmer
and
dimmer
went
out
and
it
was
the
man
this
time
who
tackled
the
situation
i
am
your
guide
i
know
the
way
in
the
dark
he
spoke
in
english
as
he
swept
the
girl
into
his
arms
carrying
her
like
a
feather
down
the
great
temple
where
perchance
he
had
held
her
against
his
heart
century
upon
century
ago
even
when
the
flowers
and
animals
had
been
brought
from
syria
may
i
drive
you
home
i
should
love
to
he
said
as
he
placed
her
on
her
feet
near
the
car
he
spoke
in
english
with
an
eagerness
out
of
keeping
with
the
trivial
request
and
which
was
merely
the
expression
of
a
desire
to
be
with
her
under
commonplace
circumstances
please
do
i
do
think
i
could
i
am
so
tired
the
was
accustomed
to
the
strange
habits
of
the
white
people
but
although
almost
drunken
with
slumber
he
peered
closely
and
furtively
at
the
driver
thank
you
so
much
said
damaris
gravely
with
her
hand
against
a
mark
upon
her
cheek
caused
by
the
pressure
of
an
amulet
made
of
a
emerald
in
a
dull
gold
setting
and
which
hugh
carden
ali
wore
night
and
day
above
his
heart
is
there
anything
else
as
wonderful
to
see
as
the
temple
deir
the
man
spoke
curtly
and
made
no
further
comment
not
for
him
was
it
to
offer
himself
as
guide
ah
yes
of
course
but
people
go
to
it
in
crowds
and
one
has
to
follow
behind
a
guide
in
a
procession
one
is
not
obliged
to
return
with
the
crowd
nor
to
listen
to
the
dragoman
who
knows
nothing
about
the
of
punt
which
were
planted
upon
the
terrace
to
perfume
the
air
under
the
light
of
the
full
moon
in
the
days
of
queen
hatshepu
with
apparent
abruptness
she
ended
the
conversation
i
share
my
godmother
great
faith
in
you
good
night
she
put
out
her
hand
as
he
salaamed
with
hands
to
brow
and
lips
and
heart
perhaps
that
was
why
he
failed
to
see
it
or
was
it
perhaps
that
he
still
felt
the
softness
of
her
against
his
heart

soothe

wounded
pride
at

ben

the
tortures
of
the
nethermost
pit
down

his
heart
was
not
in

at
all
it
was
literally
at
damaris
feet
he
had
not
rushed
away
in
pique
after
her
refusal
of
him
on
the
night
of
the
ball
nor
with
any
vague
idea
of
causing
her
to
regret
her
decision
in
realising
the
vacuum
in
her
existence
which
his
absence
might
make
he
had
not
an
ounce
of
subtlety
or
vanity
in
his
nature
he
had
gone
because
he
thought
it
would
be
the
decent
thing
to
do
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
and
also
to
hide
his
hurt
and
disappointment
which
were
deep
the
rumour
of
lion
was
genuine
and
the
excitement
extending
far
down
the
nile
intense
in
fact
with
the
aid
of
the
oriental
prodigal
imagination
the
one
royal
beast
of
feminine
persuasion
which
was
reported
as
having
been
seen
prowling
around
deir
had
been
multiplied
to
two
pairs
ravaging
the
outskirts
of
assouan
he
sat
drinking
coffee
with
jolly
sybil
sidmouth
and
her
stepmother
in
the
lounge
of
the
savoy
hotel
in
assouan
just
at
the
moment
when
damaris
sat
herself
down
on
the
broken
column
in
the
hypostyle
hall
jolly
bad
luck
we
had
have
we
said
sybil
kelham
nodded
his
head
the
last
post
had
come
in
with
nothing
for
him
but
a
few
letters
from
home
yes
rotten
he
replied
after
a
moment
she
have
sent
me
a
line
sybil
stepmother
moved
restlessly
in
her
chair
ridden
with
nerves
she
was
also
mother
of
neurotic
and
plain
who
sered
by
nature
and
yellowed
by
time
and
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
matrimonial
hedge
had
been
only
too
glad
to
foist
her
on
to
the
plump
shoulders
of
jolly
capable
pretty
sybil
and
to
get
rid
of
them
both
for
the
winter
in
the
last
week
or
so
a
sprouting
of
hope
had
pierced
the
matchmaking
soil
in
the
querulous
lady
really
heart
for
like
the
proverbial
a
is
distinctly
better
than
none
at
all
but
sybil
only
smiled
at
the
of
the
young
remark
for
weeks
she
had
been
the
recipient
of
his
confidences
he
had
dragged
her
suffocating
down
into
the
of
the
diffidence
in
which
he
wallowed
had
tugged
her
gasping
to
the
olympian
heights
from
which
he
viewed
a
world
of
love
all
had
flung
her
senseless
from
exhaustion
upon
the
rocks
of
despair
and
had
taken
her
paddling
in
the
wash
of
his
vapourings
she
was
absolutely
with
a
firm
belief
in
the
lion
rumour
and
later
long
after
the
end
of
this
story
became
the
jolly
popular
wife
of
the
great
to
whom
she
had
rushed
when
after
a
scene
with
her
she
had
missed
the
target
entirely
at
bisley
as
it
happened
the
duchess
had
written
but
in
a
moment
of
most
unusual
aberration
had
put
khartoum
on
the
envelope
instead
of
assouan
so
that
it
was
months
long
after
the
end
of
this
story
that
the
letter
reached
him
strange
is
it
how
the
lives
of
men
are
wrecked
or
made
through
the
most
trivial
happenings
the
grain
of
dust
in
the
eye
the
mudbank
in
the
river
the
hen
in
the
road
just
think
of
the
outcome
of
such
insignificant
incidents
the
last
letter
he
had
received
had
been
written
in
heliopolis
on
the
eve
of
her
grace
sudden
decision
the
one
that
had
gone
astray
had
been
mailed
in
luxor
and
had
contained
the
request
that
when
he
had
shot
the
lion
he
would
take
the
carcase
or
the
skin
as
a
present
to
damaris
at
the
winter
palace
hotel
and
wait
there
until
her
return
from
the
oasis
of
khargegh
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
he
was
genuinely
in
love
lion
or
no
lion
in
the
vicinity
he
would
sit
dreaming
for
hours
amongst
the
rock
tombs
at
full
noon
or
fall
of
evening
or
by
the
light
of
the
a
perfectly
absurd
proceeding
where
big
game
is
concerned
food
or
sleep
meant
nothing
to
him
so
that
his
usual
was
sharpened
and
his
undoubted
good
looks
enchanced
by
a
certain
romantic
gauntness
under
the
people
seemed
as
ghosts
to
him
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
love
and
his
pain
so
that
his
act
of
rising
when
sidmouth
took
what
she
thought
to
be
a
diplomatic
departure
was
purely
mechanical
then
sybil
laughed
a
jolly
ringing
laugh
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
why
do
you
run
up
to
heliopolis
by
jove
sybil
that
an
idea
you
come
along
too
damaris
would
love
to
meet
you
you
just
her
sort
besides
there
nothing
doing
in
lion
here
it
only
a
yarn
let
pack
and
get
off
i
go
and
see
if
we
can
get
a
private
steamer
stick
a
public
one
stopping
every
other
minute
to
look
at
tombs
sybil
laughed
we
go
ben
it
will
be
ripping
but
how
exactly
like
a
man
ben
was
contrite
he
thought
sybil
travelled
with
a
and
her
guns
he
had
forgotten
mamma
mamma
protested
she
was
an
invalid
with
all
an
paraphernalia
they
started
after
the
passing
of
a
week
in
which
sidmouth
had
a
series
of
and
in
which
sybil
to
pass
the
time
wrote
a
letter
to
ellen
thistleton
which
she
duly
received
at
breakfast
they
certainly
did
not
stop
en
route
to
look
at
temples
or
tombs
but
they
made
quite
a
long
halt
on
the
sandbank
just
above
luxor
onto
which
boats
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
so
often
run
the
loss
of
time
is
irritating
enough
goodness
knows
in
ordinary
travelling
and
occurs
quite
frequently
but
when
one
is
and
this
maddening
delay
happens
then
you
have
to
make
as
big
an
exercise
of
as
when
you
rush
onto
the
platform
only
to
see
the
guard
van
of
your
train
disappearing
into
the
tunnel
and
surely
the
gods
laughed
long
and
loud
when
damaris
chose
that
very
day
to
return
by
public
steamer
from
denderah
where
she
had
been
to
visit
the
temple
of
hathor

egyptian

exhaustively
energetic

belied
their

which
was
dun
and
which
though
of

is
distinct
from

it
has
infinitely
more

a
vast

a

his

except
of
course
for
the

which
were
of
a
snapping
blue
reminded
one
of
a
tomato
salad
dressed
with
chilis
and
smothered
in

temper

they
had
fought
over
everything
until
they
had
smashed
their
engagement

was
engaged
to
a
parson
in
edinburgh
one
of
the
of

she
made
a
doormat
of
herself
loving
the
herculean
minister
and
though
longing
to
stay
at
home
and
get
married
had
at
her
lover
earnest
request
consented
to
accompany
her
mother
and
sister
to
egypt
instead
to
his
fervent
mind
the
loss
of
a
few
months
of
married
life
would
be
compensated
for
by
the
biblical
discourses
upon
the
land
of
moses
with
which
later
on
as
his
wife
she
would
be
able
to
enliven
meetings

admired

a
lot
though
her
independence
and
colouring
shocked
them
not
a
little
in
the
seclusion
of
the
double
bedroom
as
they
brushed
or
twisted
their
lanky
locks
in
hindes
they
whispered
about
her
which
had
presumably
gone
agley
and
thrilled
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
over
the
gossip
anent
the
mythical
sheikh
if
they
had
asked
damaris
about
the
myth
she
would
have
told
them
everything

simply
and
truthfully

would
have
cleared
up

large
and
recumbent
and
averse

after
a
talk
with
her
daughters

seen
to
it
that
damaris
had
no

for
moping

went
here
there
and
everywhere
played

as
you

somebody

and
was
thoroughly
miserable

was
miserable
too
so
was
the
bulldog

a
certain
unconfessed
and
indefinable
vigilance
they
both
felt
called
upon
to
exercise

nervy

giving
pithy
verbal
expression
to
the
ragged
state
of
her
nerves
as
she
cut
the
stalks
of
the
beautiful
flowers
which
came
daily
without
name
or
message
the
dog
method
of
expressing
himself
was
somewhat
more
violent
it
consisted
of
the
sudden
seizure
between
his
great
teeth
of
the
posterior
portion
of
the
nether
garments
of
males
white
or
coloured
you
could
almost
tell
the
status
of
the
male
bipeds
by
casting
a
discreet
eye
upon
their
raiment
and
as
there
was
not
a
muzzle
in
egypt
big
enough
to
fit
the
dog
it
had
ended
in
him
being
led
or
chained
in
polite
society
damaris
table
was
next
that
of
the
thistletons
who
with
a
vague
memory
maybe
of
their
duty
towards
their
neighbour
as
instilled
on
sundays
into
their
rebellious
infantile
heads
chatted
brightly
to
right
and
to
left
of
them
at
meals
full
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
they
allowed
it
to
overflow
into
their
writhing
neighbours
jugs
they
broke
through
the
glacial
atmosphere
which
surrounds
the
britisher
newspaper
propped
against
was
no
barrier
their
gladsome
invitations
or
suggestions
dammed
for
the
moment
would
rise
at
last
level
with
the
paper
edge
to
trickle
down
the
other
side
and
mingle
with
the
eggs
and
bacon
porridge
kidneys
or
whatever
trifle
the
plate
might
contain
they
read
out
scraps
of
news
from
the
morning
paper
they
read
out
bits
of
home
news
from
their
stacks
of
correspondence
written
for
the
most
part
on
eight
pages
and
in
the
sprawling
uncontrolled
script
of
the
woman
who
has
nothing
but
trivialities
with
which
to
fill
her
day
their
blood
was
blue
their
upbringing
beyond
suspicion
they
simply
erred
through
a
supply
of
the
philanthropic
fluid
they
had
come
home
the
night
before
but
were
first
down
to
breakfast
as
happy
as
could
be
at
the
thought
of
the
strenuous
day
before
them
and
were
ostentatiously
comparing
their
books
of
notes
or
jottings
when
damaris
came
in
they
went
everywhere
with
in
their
hands
and
made
entries
at
the
most
inconvenient
moments
during
their
journey
to
you
or
me
they
would
have
seemed
but
jottings
but
berenice
could
have
read
you
a
in
the
thick
markings
of
her
and
ellen
a
from
the
hieroglyphics
and
inscriptions
copied
by
her
scratchy
stylo
and
under
which
she
essayed
to
bury
the
memory
of
the
inverness
damaris
slid
into
her
seat
with
an
inward
prayer
that
she
might
be
allowed
time
to
read
her
mail
which
consisted
of
a
fat
letter
from
her
godmother
and
a
bulky
one
from
home
perhaps
will
be
back
soon
she
thought
opening
the
other
letter
first
as
is
a
way
with
us
perverse
humans
enclosed
was
an
letter
to
her
mother
from
her
brother
written
from
harrow
it
awfully
jolly
wrote
the
enthusiastic
youngster
being
in
ben
kelham
house
they
still
talk
about
his
last
against
bumbles
do
you
remember
i
just
got
over
mumps
and
we
went
down
for
it
bumbles
had
six
to
win
and
ten
minutes
to
do
it
in
when
howard
was
bowled
and
carden
their
captain
went
in
and
drove
right
over
the
pav
he
won
the
match
by
one
do
you
remember
and
then
kelham
caught
him
magnificently
in
the
slips
just
as
time
was
up
damaris
looked
at
a
bunch
of
jasmine
lying
beside
her
plate
and
sighed
as
she
opened
her
godmother
letter
then
sighed
again
more
profoundly
the
duchess
had
arrived
at
khargegh
without
mishap
she
described
the
journey
gradually
ascending
through
the
desert
then
down
through
the
narrow
valley
of
rocks
the
wastes
of
rock
and
gravel
the
beautiful
valley
the
great
plain
to
with
its
its
filthy
lanes
its
mosques
with
the
limestone
hills
almost
surrounding
it
and
we
ca
get
any
further
my
dear
a
report
has
come
of
the
appearance
near
here
of
a
notorious
robber
gang
which
has
infested
the
desert
farther
south
for
years
i
do
believe
it
myself
hobson
is
furious
as
the
hotel
we
are
in
is
not
totally
devoid
of
shall
i
call
them
mosquitoes
but
the
authorities
refuse
to
allow
us
to
proceed
i
have
sent
a
runner
through
to
the
friend
i
was
going
to
see
damaris
touched
the
jasmine
at
her
side
and
sighed
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
history
when
i
return
so
sad
my
child
so
very
tragic
she
may
come
to
see
me
as
the
authorities
have
no
power
over
her
she
is
staying
at
her
eldest
son
house
until
his
return
i
will
let
you
know
my
movements
as
soon
as
i
can
enjoy
yourself
dekko
is
very
quiet
he
is
either
apprehensive
or
going
to
moult
damaris
smiled
spasmodically
when
as
she
put
the
letter
down
under
the
jasmine
her
neighbours
let
off
a
broadside
the
head
dragoman
wanted
to
get
up
a
party
for
deir
on
the
morrow
he
had
twenty
pairs
of
donkeys
all
of
which
were
so
accustomed
it
seemed
to
going
about
in
a
bunch
that
they
refused
to
move
a
step
if
one
pair
was
missing
nineteen
pairs
had
been
filled
from
the
different
hotels
one
pair
was
still
minus
riders
would
damaris
make
a
couple
with
lumlough
lumlough
who
was
of
the
raw
age
of
nineteen
and
who
worshipped
in
secret
at
the
girl
shrine
blushed
divinely
and
coughed
damaris
shook
her
head
she
longed
to
see
the
temple
as
she
longed
to
go
to
denderah
but
not
in
a
crowd
also
she
longed
to
confide
all
her
secrets
of
which
her
visit
to
the
temple
of
amnon
was
not
one
of
the
least
to
her
godmother
she
was
just
the
slightest
bit
scared
and
being
very
young
felt
incapable
of
prescribing
for
her
burnt
she
had
only
to
keep
away
from
the
fire
but
as
i
have
already
said
she
was
very
young
do
damaris
we
are
taking
our
lunch
on
donkeys
as
well
but
why
not
let
the
empty
pair
go
without
riders
or
let
lumlough
go
on
one
and
let
the
other
trot
by
its
side
without
anyone
i
sure
it
would
love
a
holiday
no
these
twenty
pairs
of
donkeys
belonged
to
an
asinine
trades
union
the
twenty
pairs
went
together
or
not
at
all
they
went
up
the
steep
hill
with
a
human
being
on
their
backs
or
not
at
all
if
one
solitary
moke
out
of
the
forty
should
be
asked
to
climb
a
hill
with
nothing
on
its
back
it
would
not
move
one
step
no
not
if
the
most
luscious
carrot
feast
awaited
it
at
the
top
and
if
it
refused
to
budge
the
others
would
support
it
by
also
refusing
to
budge
yes
even
if
they
held
up
the
whole
of
the
tourist
season
for
eternity
and
never
again
tasted
luscious
carrot
in
all
the
years
allotted
to
the
asinine
race
what
the
good
of
customs
if
you
do
stick
to
them
the
donkeys
parents
had
always
climbed
that
hill
and
what
was
good
enough
for
them
was
also
good
enough
for
their
descendants
i
think
it
horrid
of
you
damaris
besides
what
are
you
going
to
do
all
by
yourself
said
ellen
opening
a
letter
bits
of
which
she
proceeded
to
read
out
here
a
letter
from
sybil
sidmouth
she
and
kelham
are
having
a
very
poor
time
sitting
about
in
the
rocks
and
tombs
all
day
and
half
the
night
how
romantic
sighed
berenice
all
alone
with
nature
in
an
egyptian
desert
it
reminds
me
of
omar
jug
and
loaf
verse
how
does
it
go
she
flipped
through
her
notebook
ah
here
it
is
and
she
proceeded
to
read
with
appropriate
punctuation
with
her
on
the
edge
of
her
saucer
a
book
of
verses
underneath
the
bough
a
jug
of
wine
a
loaf
of
bread
and
thou
beside
me
singing
in
the
wilderness
o
wilderness
were
paradise
enow
she
looked
up
suddenly
surprised
and
indignant
at
ellen
who
had
kicked
her
violently
under
the
table
then
she
tried
to
cover
up
her
confusion
at
her
unfortunate
sidmouth
of
course
is
far
from
well
she
continued
but
ellen
broke
in
in
her
high
staccato
and
appalling
french
à
nos
or
at
least
our
donkeys
she
looked
at
damaris
who
with
eyes
laughed
at
the
feeble
joke
do
change
your
mind
damaris
the
guide
is
yussuf
the
very
best
you
know
besides
we
see
the
lion
all
right
said
damaris
tucking
the
jasmine
into
the
belt
of
her
white
dress
which
she
had
never
done
before
i
come
twenty
pairs
of
donkeys
climbing
up
a
hill
will
be
an
awfully
funny
sight
do
you
think
so
mr
lumlough
she
smiled
across
at
lumlough
who
was
thereupon
transported
to
the
portals
of
the
seventh
heaven
with
a
piece
of
toast
and
marmalade
in
his
right
hand
chapter
xx
was
never
less
alone
than
when
by
gibbon
next
morning
with
her
chaperon
energetic
daughters
damaris
found
herself
one
of
the
herd
foregathered
on
the
nile
bank
preparatory
to
the
excursion
to
the
valley
of
the
kings
and
later
in
the
afternoon
by
mountain
path
over
the
ridge
to
that
marvel
of
antiquity
the
of
deir
i
do
want
to
go
janie
dear
she
said
the
preceding
night
whilst
the
devoted
maid
wielded
brushes
on
the
burnished
hair
better
go
dearie
one
must
be
polite
even
if
the
heart
breaks
jane
coop
literary
plane
swung
between
a
weekly
entitled
real
stories
from
high
life
and
ouida
novels
which
latter
she
had
bought
in
the
charing
cross
road
and
kept
sandwiched
between
her
bible
and
grandmother
herb
recipes
but
i
do
want
to
go
i
hate
crowds
and
i
ca
take
wellington
every
native
flies
from
him
since
he
got
behind
the
musical
colossus
and
growled
you
remember
they
thought
it
was
the
statue
speaking
and
the
dear
old
darling
was
only
trying
to
catch
a
lizard
the
bulldog
loathed
egypt
he
was
always
either
in
disgrace
or
being
talked
to
in
baby
language
he
had
seen
next
to
nothing
of
his
beloved
mistress
and
his
digestion
had
been
almost
ruined
by
the
amount
of
chocolates
he
had
eaten
out
of
pure
boredom
take
me
he
said
every
time
his
beloved
went
out
as
plainly
as
could
be
by
means
of
his
beautiful
face
and
tail
but
excursions
had
grown
rarer
and
rarer
and
his
slender
middle
more
and
more
defined
through
grief
my
heart
is
breaking
janie
damaris
declared
sitting
up
in
bed
i
know
it
is
dearie
there
nothing
to
break
it
over
sure
i
was
just
repeating
from
scarlet
sin
where
the
beautiful
heroine
is
torn
between
two
stools
as
it
were
jane
coop
had
no
use
for
knights
who
left
the
field
of
combat
and
as
for
the
tales
which
were
duly
carried
to
her
of
an
arabian
chief
who
followed
her
young
mistress
in
the
desert
and
sent
her
bunches
of
flowers
and
trash
well
it
was
all
you
could
expect
if
you
left
your
own
country
for
heathen
parts
to
jane
coop
rides
in
the
desert
in
egypt
were
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
day
programme
as
rides
on
donkeys
at
had
been
in
margate
before
interfering
people
began
to
make
a
fuss
about
the
rider
weight
you
mind
your
own
hedges
maria
hobson
and
see
that
your
own
cattle
do
go
with
their
monkey
tricks
she
had
said
tartly
and
not
to
her
grace
maid
who
had
heard
from
someone
who
had
heard
from
someone
else
that
miss
hethencourt
was
out
at
all
hours
of
the
night
here
there
and
everywhere
i
know
what
time
she
comes
in
and
where
she
has
been
and
who
with
and
that
quite
enough
for
me
thank
you
i
can
shepherd
my
own
flock
she
was
not
exactly
within
the
confines
of
truth
in
her
statement
but
having
learned
in
her
youth
to
diagnose
the
hurt
of
dumb
animals
she
felt
she
was
fully
qualified
to
treat
her
beloved
child
unrest
without
any
verbal
aid
from
outsiders
yet
something
a
warning
from
the
future
maybe
had
prompted
her
to
speak
this
night
as
she
stood
beside
the
bed
looking
down
upon
the
beauty
of
the
child
to
whom
she
seemed
more
than
anyone
else
to
stand
in
the
position
of
sponsor
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
dearie
she
stroked
the
red
head
lovingly
as
it
leant
against
the
motherly
bosom
upon
which
had
so
often
rested
errant
lambs
and
stricken
pullets
yes
janie
darling
i
would
promise
you
anything
i
know
things
are
going
crosswise
a
bit
with
you
dearie
as
they
always
do
in
an
unknown
country
but
i
do
worry
about
that
because
at
the
crossways
there
is
always
a
signpost
but
now
that
we
are
in
this
heathen
land
i
want
your
promise
that
you
will
always
tell
me
where
you
are
going
to
when
you
go
out
always
if
it
out
for
a
ride
in
the
desert
or
over
amongst
them
or
out
to
a
or
dance
will
you
dearie
always
the
insistence
in
the
demand
made
the
girl
look
up
into
the
homely
face
and
she
did
not
smile
as
she
made
a
little
cross
above
her
heart
in
the
manner
of
children
i
promise
janie
cross
heart
and
i
starting
out
morning
on
an
excursion
to
the
tombs
of
the
kings
we
are
taking
lunch
with
us
and
remnants
of
sandwiches
amongst
egypt
dead
tea
at
the
rest
house
and
she
stopped
for
a
minute
then
continued
slowly
and
if
i
do
come
back
with
the
rest
janie
dear
do
worry
it
full
moon
and
i
may
stay
to
see
the
temple
by
moonlight
a
moment
silence
then
said
practical
jane
and
as
you
ca
take
wellington
dearie
will
you
promise
to
take
your
revolver
you
know
they
say
lions
have
been
seen
in
damaris
laughed
they
left
janie
they
all
at
assouan
waiting
to
be
shot
by
kelham
and
miss
sidmouth
jane
coop
sniffed
as
she
tucked
in
the
and
kissed
her
child
she
had
got
to
the
door
when
damaris
spoke
janie
you
know
all
about
birds
do
you
hens
dearie
well
the
girl
voice
came
muffled
as
though
she
had
drawn
the
sheet
about
her
face
supposing
a
hawk
hawks
are
hens
dearie
well
hens
supposing
you
had
a
breed
of
hens
that
were
all
all
oh
any
colour
white
leghorns
said
jane
coop
who
was
beginning
to
get
interested
in
this
subject
so
near
her
heart
yes
well
supposing
you
found
that
one
when
it
had
all
its
feathers
had
some
speckled
ones
under
its
wings
but
it
could
dearie
if
it
was
yes
but
just
supposing
it
had
what
would
be
the
meaning
of
it
jane
coop
hesitated
and
her
descriptive
analysis
was
not
her
strong
forte
well
dearie
i
should
say
that
the
male
bird
was
a
a
oh
a
plymouth
rock
or
something
like
that
the
speckled
bird
would
be
a
good
one
but
if
it
was
mixed
it
would
have
to
be
turned
out
of
the
run
if
you
had
a
fancy
for
showing
and
prizes
i
remember
a
black
but
there
now
what
made
you
start
your
old
nannie
talking
about
hens
just
you
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
dearie
you
have
to
be
up
and
away
early
you
know
she
closed
the
door
gently
and
left
the
girl
alone
i
do
understand
she
said
softly
and
slipped
out
of
bed
to
stand
at
the
open
window
with
all
the
glory
of
an
egyptian
night
before
her
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
story
she
repeated
as
she
watched
the
figure
of
a
wrapped
in
a
big
cloak
which
shone
under
the
moon
trudging
patiently
across
the
grounds
to
the
servants
quarters
then
as
the
huge
dog
flung
himself
against
her
she
struck
her
hands
together
the
sudden
impact
sent
her
mind
flying
back
to
the
first
time
she
had
seen
hugh
carden
ali
in
english
and
mohammedan
in
the
bazaar
then
in
her
memory
she
saw
him
dining
as
an
englishman
saw
him
riding
with
falcon
upon
fist
a
very
eastern
saw
him
as
an
arab
of
arabia
in
the
desert
again
as
an
englishman
save
for
the
mohammedan
holding
in
the
bay
mare
as
she
thundered
past
him
on
the
stallion
sooltan
in
a
flash
she
understood
the
tragic
story
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
the
pity
of
it
she
whispered
oh
the
cruel
pity
of
it
and
crept
back
to
bed
and
quiet
she
stood
very
early
next
morning
with
the
jostling
laughing
crowd
waiting
to
be
ferried
across
the
nile
on
the
excursion
to
the
tombs
of
the
kings
which
to
most
of
the
crowd
ranked
on
a
level
with
madame
tussaud
waxworks
with
the
difference
that
in
the
valley
of
desolation
you
could
leave
the
remnants
of
your
lunch
anywhere
which
is
a
habit
strictly
forbidden
in
the
marylebone
road
mounting
the
diminutive
donkeys
caused
peals
of
laughter
the
hamlets
of
and
rang
with
the
cries
of
the
cavalcade
and
damaris
blindly
followed
lady
thistleton
energetic
offspring
as
with
and
pencil
they
followed
the
guide
in
and
out
of
the
regulation
tombs
of
biban
the
history
of
which
he
repeated
with
monotony
lucy
jones
lighthearted
tourist
thought
the
lunch
awfully
jolly
in
the
shade
of
the
tomb
in
fact
she
made
it
a
riotous
feast
with
the
help
of
others
as
young
and
as
herself
after
all
what
did
it
matter
as
lucy
said
the
dead
had
been
such
a
jolly
long
time
dead
and
the
desolation
of
the
valley
made
such
a
splendid
contrast
to
the
golden
sunshine
and
violent
blue
of
the
sky
the
path
down
to
deir
occasioned
more
laughter
and
little
screams
and
offers
of
help
from
the
sterner
male
who
under
an
extreme
insouciance
tried
to
hide
the
insecurity
of
his
perch
on
the
back
of
the
humble
scrambling
quadruped
when
the
laughing
jostling
and
somewhat
dishevelled
crowd
streamed
back
down
the
second
incline
and
across
the
central
terrace
en
route
for
the
donkeys
it
left
damaris
standing
with
dancing
eyes
and
laughing
mouth
under
the
blue
and
ceiling
of
the
shrine
and
when
the
last
sound
of
laughter
and
clattering
stone
under
nimble
hoof
had
melted
away
when
the
sky
had
turned
the
marble
temple
mauve
and
pink
and
deepest
red
and
back
to
pink
to
mauve
to
softest
white
when
the
first
star
had
fastened
the
robe
of
day
to
the
cloak
of
night
and
silence
had
fallen
like
balm
upon
the
wound
caused
by
raucous
voices
damaris
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
colonnade
of
punt
she
was
quite
alone
chapter

so
dark

through
its
woof
there
run
some
blessed
threads
of
cranach
it
is
difficult
no
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
wonder
of
deir

just
as
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
light
that
never
was
on

it
is
the

say
or
think
we
have
met
before
may
it
not
have
been
that
we
once
met
to
burn
incense
together
before
the
dread
god
anubis
or
to
make
offerings
upon
the
altar
erected
to
the
great
god
ra
hamarkhis
or
was
it
perchance
that
you
if
you
are
a
woman
once
waited
at
the
temple
gates
to
see
him
pass
upon
his
return
from
the
great
expedition
to
the
land
of
punt
which
we
call
somaliland
had
the
man
with
who
offers
you
a
muffin
or
cup
of
tea
once
brought
you
gifts
of
ivory
or
incense
or
skin
of
panther
from
the
wonderland
did
he
sweep
the
seething
crowd
with
piercing
eye
to
find
the
face
beloved
and
pass
on
to
the
rolling
of
drums
the
crash
of
cymbals
the
blaring
of
trumpets
to
make
obeisance
to
his
monarch
and
return
thanks
to
the
mighty
gods
perchance
but
damaris
had
no
thought
of
the
past
as
she
stood
amongst
the
pillars
of
the
colonnade
which
commemorate
the
great
expedition
she
was
enthralled
with
the
hour
the
solitude
the
silence
as
she
hesitated
wondering
which
way
to
go
then
even
as
she
hesitated
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
distant
throbbing
of
a
drum
it
came
from
one
of
the
villages
far
down
the
hill
and
caught
by
the
evening
breeze
was
carried
to
the
temple
to
be
multiplied
a
hundredfold
in
the
echoing
roof
all
other
sounds
may
cease
way
out
in
the
east
birds
may
nest
and
humans
sleep
but
the
sound
of
the
drum
faileth
never
it
is
a
message
a
a
lament
a
prayer
and
you
hear
it
in
the
desert
as
in
the
jungle
in
the
temple
as
in
the
courtyard
behind
the
hovel
it
is
not
a
wise
thing
to
listen
to
its
call
for
it
can
lead
you
off
the
beaten
track
or
over
the
precipice
or
out
into
the
desert
to
die
it
caught
the
girl
feet
in
the
witchery
of
its
rhythm
and
set
them
moving
upon
the
floor
of
the
temple
yet
there
was
no
smile
on
her
lips
as
moved
by
whatever
it
is
that
causes
us
to
do
strange
things
in
the
east
she
danced
like
a
wraith
or
a
sylph
or
a
leaf
in
the
wind
in
and
out
of
the
columns
and
out
into
the
light
of
the
moon
and
through
the
granite
door
onto
the
terrace
where
once
had
been
planted
the
incense
trees
which
had
come
with
the
spoil
from
punt
to
perfume
the
air
to
the
glory
of
ra
hamarkhis
the
rolling
of
the
drum
stopped
short
and
damaris
came
to
herself
with
a
start
as
she
stood
under
the
moon
then
clasped
her
hands
upon
her
thudding
heart
as
she
watched
a
man
with
two
great
shaggy
dogs
walk
across
the
terrace
towards
her
save
for
the
mohammedan
he
was
an
englishman
and
he
spoke
in
his
mother
tongue
to
the
girl
he
loved
and
whom
he
had
watched
since
her
arrival
with
the
jostling
laughing
crowd
the
gods
of
the
temple
are
good
to
me
he
said
simply
i
prayed
that
i
might
watch
you
dance
upon
the
incense
terrace
of
their
house
they
have
answered
my
prayer
come
as
they
passed
across
the
terrace
to
the
hall
of
columns
which
is
the
vestibule
of
the
chapel
of
the
god
of
death
he
told
her
how
he
had
watched
and
waited
meaning
no
discourtesy
until
she
should
visit
the
temple
amongst
the
limestone
hills
where
are
we
going
damaris
spoke
more
to
break
the
spell
which
seemed
to
hold
her
than
to
know
the
end
of
the
walk
across
the
sand
bewitched
by
the
moon
and
the
terrific
power
of
old
egypt
she
would
have
followed
the
man
blindly
fearing
no
hurt
even
into
the
sanctuary
which
hewn
out
of
the
rock
itself
lies
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
temple
to
the
shrine
of
anubis
the
god
of
death
where
i
would
show
you
the
hawk
of
northern
egypt
upon
the
wall
they
passed
between
the
great
columns
and
up
the
flight
of
steps
to
the
doorway
beyond
which
lie
the
chambers
of
the
shrine
and
there
hugh
carden
ali
took
the
girl
hand
as
he
called
her
name
aloud
until
the
walls
or
the
spirits
of
the
gods
thundered
back
the
echo
the
gods
introduced
the
kings
of
egypt
to
the
sanctuary
anubis
god
of
death
as
you
will
see
by
the
painting
upon
the
wall
led
the
great
queen
to
the
door
he
said
in
reply
to
a
whispered
question
from
damaris
i
would
not
that
the
shadow
of
death
touched
the
hem
of
your
raiment
i
called
your
name
aloud
so
that
the
gods
might
hear
do
i
believe
in
such
strange
things
how
can
one
say
i
believe
or
do
not
believe
in
this
land
which
is
in
the
grip
of
a
dead
past
which
is
not
dead
and
they
passed
in
through
the
door
and
stood
looking
up
at
the
hawk
of
horus
painted
in
the
xviii
dynasty
upon
the
wall
brilliant
in
colouring
green
and
white
with
wings
it
spreads
them
above
the
place
where
once
was
seen
the
painted
picture
of
the
queen
who
reigned
and
suffered
and
died
thousands
of
years
ago
ah
said
damaris
as
she
looked
up
to
the
corner
it
is
your
your
crest
your
it
is
a
fantasy
of
mine
we
trace
my
father
house
right
back
without
a
break
to
the
days
of
the
pharaohs
so
i
believe
does
mohammed
ali
vendor
of
slippers
in
the
bazaar
he
paused
then
added
abruptly
with
a
frown
and
a
movement
of
the
shoulders
as
though
he
were
trying
to
shift
a
burden
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
inner
chamber
if
you
are
not
afraid
i
will
interpret
the
story
of
the
hawk
to
you
in
the
shadows
where
it
belongs
damaris
put
out
her
hand
as
though
to
speak
then
passed
into
the
inner
room
across
the
threshold
of
which
the
dogs
of
billi
laid
themselves
down
death
is
around
us
said
hugh
carden
ali
do
you
believe
in
omens
no
nor
i
wish
there
was
a
seat
so
that
you
could
rest
whilst
i
tell
you
damaris
laid
her
hand
gently
upon
his
arm
and
he
looked
down
into
the
face
shining
in
the
reflection
of
the
moon
which
had
silted
in
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
you
know
damaris
looked
up
and
smiled
yes
i
know
and
being
the
son
of
such
splendid
people
i
can
not
understand
why
the
gates
of
pain
and
love
and
sacrifice
were
opened
and
the
girl
shrank
back
against
the
wall
as
the
tide
of
bitterness
swept
around
her
in
the
ruined
shrine
the
man
face
was
white
his
eyes
blazed
in
the
agony
of
his
hurt
whilst
the
dogs
lifted
their
heads
and
growled
you
do
not
understand
you
do
not
understand
that
i
love
you
and
loving
you
i
stand
a
prisoner
behind
the
bars
wrought
for
me
by
the
love
of
my
parents
that
i
love
you
as
surely
you
never
have
been
never
will
be
loved
and
that
i
dare
not
can
not
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
even
if
you
loved
me
which
you
do
not
what
you
do
not
see
why
i
should
not
marry
into
my
mother
race
even
as
my
father
did
i
will
tell
you
why
he
gripped
her
wrists
and
pulled
her
to
him
because
i
am
the
outcome
of
their
union
my
father
is
an
arab
my
mother
an
englishwoman
i
i
am
a
i
am
nearer
white
truly
than
my
father
but
but
my
son
although
he
might
be
white
or
dark
a
a
native
as
you
say
in
england
would
only
be
a
lying
on
your
white
breast
if
you
were
my
wife
the
moonbeams
lengthened
as
the
man
talked
on
whilst
damaris
learned
of
one
of
love
bitterest
mistakes
oh
forgive
me
he
ended
why
did
i
bring
you
here
to
hurt
you
to
make
you
cry
for
a
pain
which
is
not
yours
why
are
you
left
alone
it
is
so
dangerous
in
this
land
of
my
fathers
your
godmother
deserts
you
whilst
she
goes
to
my
mother
who
is
afraid
for
me
ah
did
you
not
know
the
man
who
loves
you
has
left
you
to
the
wind
of
chance
my
friend
big
ben
kelham
o
gods
of
ancient
egypt
how
you
must
laugh
my
shall
we
meet
again
i
wonder
surely
anubis
the
god
of
death
anubis
the
who
leads
the
soul
of
the
departed
through
the
underworld
into
the
presence
of
the
great
osiris
surely
he
moved
upon
the
wall
and
turned
to
look
after
those
two
as
they
passed
out
of
the
inner
chamber
to
stand
beneath
the
hawk
upon
the
wall
or
was
it
the
shifting
of
the
moon
amongst
the
shadows
will
you
there
was
no
trace
of
the
man
anguish
in
his
voice
the
mohammedan
resignation
to
the
inevitable
may
seem
a
weak
way
out
to
one
who
will
kick
and
worry
until
he
drops
from
exhaustion
but
it
saves
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
others
will
you
you
must
surely
marry
some
day
so
beautiful
so
sweet
you
are
will
you
let
me
give
you
this
as
a
and
will
you
think
of
me
a
prisoner
when
you
fasten
it
in
your
he
held
out
a
jewel
in
the
shape
of
the
hawk
which
spread
its
wings
upon
the
wall
above
them
it
was
found
here
in
this
sanctuary
a
priestly
ornament
a
offering
who
knows
will
you
have
no
right
to
it
for
beneath
my
wings
is
the
plumage
of
another
race
i
am
not
a
son
of
northern
egypt
will
you
pin
it
in
the
girl
voice
shook
as
she
tilted
back
her
chin
so
that
her
mouth
was
on
a
level
with
the
man
as
he
bent
to
fasten
the
jewel
in
the
silk
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
yes
you
are
good
to
the
prisoner
allah
how
i
love
you
and
surely
if
i
may
not
be
your
master
i
may
serve
you
if
you
should
be
in
trouble
ever
in
this
land
of
egypt
the
very
soil
of
which
is
drenched
with
the
blood
of
those
who
have
fought
and
loved
and
won
and
lost
thousands
of
years
before
the
coming
of
the
gentle
prophet
who
said
that
in
the
sight
of
the
great
god
anyway
we
are
brethren
yes
if
trouble
should
come
to
you
will
you
send
me
a
messenger
to
the
tents
of
purple
and
of
gold
i
am
doing
you
a
great
wrong
in
lingering
where
i
can
catch
glimpses
of
you
i
love
you
love
you
but
that
is
no
excuse
for
causing
you
harm
through
the
wagging
of
evil
tongues
tears
dropped
one
by
one
upon
the
jewel
which
glittered
on
her
breast
and
if
i
were
in
trouble
great
trouble
if
i
were
to
come
to
you
myself
how
my
boat
waits
at
the
from
sundown
to
sunrise
the
swiftest
mare
in
all
egypt
as
the
foretold
you
the
mare
waits
from
the
setting
until
the
rising
of
the
sun
at
the
gate
of
which
is
a
ruined
portal
on
the
road
of
the
colossi
from
there
the
way
lies
west
and
fear
not
he
pointed
to
an
inscription
on
the
wall
and
translated
it
in
the
egyptian
tongue
have
come
full
of
joy
because
of
my
love
to
thee
my
hands
are
full
of
all
life
and
purity
i
am
protecting
thee
among
all
followed
by
the
dogs
they
walked
slowly
down
the
incline
to
a
mound
of
rubbish
flung
up
and
left
by
an
excavating
party
many
years
back
behind
it
they
found
the
stallion
sooltan
in
the
care
of
his
also
the
one
donkey
which
had
wandered
off
in
search
of
grass
and
got
lost
and
whose
absence
in
the
cavalcade
had
not
been
noticed
on
account
of
the
disorder
of
the
descent
kismet
had
said
jobad
the
guide
when
he
had
made
the
discovery
at
the
water
edge
if
the
white
folk
could
not
keep
count
of
themselves
he
was
not
going
to
draw
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
party
was
missing
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
providing
an
evening
meal
for
the
lion
by
offering
to
go
in
search
of
the
pair
kismet
allah
would
watch
over
them
hugh
carden
ali
leapt
to
the
saddle
without
touching
the
stirrups
then
swung
the
girl
as
lightly
as
a
leaf
up
into
his
arms
heedless
of
the
extra
burden
of
the
slip
of
a
girl
who
had
mastered
him
in
the
desert
and
who
lay
so
quietly
against
his
master
heart
the
magnificent
black
beast
stood
then
suddenly
shivered
violently
just
as
the
dogs
of
billi
belly
to
ground
eyes
blazing
ruffs
on
end
growled
softly
hugh
carden
pressed
damaris
back
against
his
shoulder
and
turned
and
looked
in
the
direction
whence
had
come
that
sound
paralysing
if
you
do
not
happen
to
be
armed
from
somewhere
amongst
the
rocky
wilderness
of
the
hills
carried
by
the
had
come
the
hoarse
coughing
of
a
lion
listen
he
said
and
as
it
came
again
with
shrieks
of
sabé
sabé
the
leapt
on
the
back
of
the
terrified
donkey
which
spurred
by
fear
disappeared
like
a
streak
down
the
hill
just
as
the
stallion
sweating
with
pure
terror
reared
and
wheeled
then
backed
with
great
eyes
rolling
and
hoofs
striking
sparks
from
the
stones
up
he
reared
until
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
not
fall
backwards
crushing
to
death
or
hideously
maiming
the
man
who
encumbered
with
the
girl
upon
his
arm
could
do
little
to
calm
the
frightened
beast
and
well
for
them
was
it
that
hugh
carden
ali
with
his
love
and
understanding
of
horses
knew
that
only
to
the
sagacity
of
the
animal
could
the
safe
negotiation
of
the
dangerous
descent
down
the
hillside
be
left
he
gave
sooltan
his
head
there
is
no
danger
in
it
goodness
knows
when
you
bestride
a
diminutive
donkey
whose
dainty
little
feet
know
every
pebble
on
the
route
but
there
is
danger
when
an
animal
like
sooltan
takes
the
avenue
of
sphinxes
at
a
mad
rush
and
slips
and
slithers
and
slides
under
the
impetus
of
his
own
weight
pace
and
terror
the
rest
of
the
way
even
if
he
is
as
as
a
goat

when
her
beloved
child
wakened
the

with
anxiety
and
cold

unhygienically
closed

had
a
great
affection
for

not

either
of
my

was
saying
the
morning
after
the
visit
to
the
terrace

to
visit
the

or
stay
out
unchaperoned
after
dark
i

beautiful
and
very
young
of
course
i
know
that
you
are
a
little
unhappy

thinking
of

damaris
smiled
the
radiant
smile
which
made
her
so
attractive
and
rising
put
her
arms
round
the
motherly
old
dear
neck
and
kissed
her
which
was
an
unusual
thing
for
her
to
do
as
she
was
as
a
rule
undemonstrative
to
coldness
i
love
to
go
to
denderah
if
i
may
take
janie
and
wellington
and
i
truly
not
worrying
it
just
a
tremendous
spirit
of
adventure
which
drives
me
to
do
these
awful
things
so
to
denderah
she
went
with
her
spirits
at
highest
pitch
at
the
thought
of
getting
away
from
luxor
for
a
few
days
and
of
seeing
the
wonderful
temple
of
hathor
the
goddess
of
joy
and
youth
she
was
in
riotous
spirits
when
she
arrived
at
the
hotel
denderah
in
kulla
where
the
lovely
porous
jugs
come
from
in
fact
so
blithe
was
she
that
ellen
inclined
to
despondency
and
of
a
superstitious
tendency
remarked
i
should
calm
myself
a
little
my
dear
damaris
such
gaiety
can
only
lead
to
depression
later
on
but
damaris
only
laughed
how
good
it
is
that
we
can
not
visualise
beforehand
the
hour
in
which
our
tears
must
flow
and
our
hearts
come
to
breaking
she
laughed
she
sang
she
visited
the
town
and
went
to
bed
early
she
teased
jane
coop
the
next
morning
as
perilously
perched
on
she
headed
the
little
procession
which
wended
its
way
through
the
stretches
of
earth
which
later
would
give
a
harvest
of
corn
and
flowering
bean
she
urged
the
panting
bulldog
along
the
three
good
miles
and
laughed
at
him
when
sneezing
and
coughing
he
rubbed
his
great
paws
over
his
face
covered
with
the
cobwebs
which
floated
on
the
air
but
she
stopped
laughing
when
she
first
caught
sight
of
the
great
arch
of
crumbling
antiquity
which
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
edifice
upon
the
site
of
which
the
temple
of
hathor
was
built
and
she
stood
quite
still
in
the
colonnade
whilst
the
thistletons
notebooks
in
hand
rushed
inside
in
the
wake
of
the
guide
jane
coop
stopped
dead
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
colonnade
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
temple
of
love
dearie
all
white
marble
with
doves
and
and
and
hearts
it
a
tomb
that
what
it
is
and
i
going
to
sit
outside
i
do
like
it
it
bodes
no
good
let
go
back
dearie
i
do
like
the
place
or
the
hotel
or
the
town
if
we
go
quickly
we
can
catch
the
first
boat
let
the
others
stay
if
they
want
to
i
thinking
of
you
my
heart
telling
me
that
you
must
not
stop
and
that
if
you
do
harm
come
to
you
or
somebody
strange
was
the
persistence
of
the
usually
placid
woman
as
she
caught
her
young
mistress
by
the
arm
and
quite
violently
shook
her
fist
at
the
sinister
face
of
the
goddess
which
shows
on
each
side
of
the
columns
and
strange
it
is
to
know
that
if
the
girl
had
but
listened
the
harm
might
not
have
befallen
but
damaris
shook
her
head
we
must
be
polite
janie
dear
even
if
we
are
dying
to
go
home
besides
two
or
three
days
will
do
us
good
and
it
will
help
pass
the
time
until
marraine
comes
back
come
the
dog
followed
his
mistress
up
to
the
door
but
there
he
stopped
come
along
she
repeated
the
dog
sat
down
with
a
definite
air
of
ending
further
exploration
as
far
as
ruins
were
concerned
on
his
part
i
think
you
and
janie
are
bewitched
damaris
spoke
petulantly
and
watched
the
dog
waddle
back
and
sit
down
beside
the
maid
who
busy
crocheting
sat
on
a
stone
some
few
yards
from
the
temple
to
which
she
had
resolutely
turned
her
back
damaris
stood
for
a
moment
feeling
as
though
the
very
wettest
of
wet
blankets
had
been
wrapped
round
her
then
turned
listened
until
she
heard
ellen
staccato
voice
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
antechamber
in
the
middle
of
the
temple
and
tiptoed
across
to
the
east
side
where
are
to
be
found
the
ruined
treasury
and
store
rooms
in
which
were
stored
the
incense
for
sacrifice
or
offering
the
vestments
and
banners
and
other
such
props
needful
to
the
correct
fulfilment
of
the
rites
of
an
ancient
worship
which
as
far
as
services
go
in
display
of
wealth
and
accessories
did
not
differ
so
very
much
from
what
we
see
in
some
of
our
churches
in
this
present
day
of
grace
she
came
to
the
stairs
up
which
so
many
years
ago
the
mother
of
hugh
carden
ali
had
climbed
on
the
day
when
she
had
fully
realised
that
the
crown
of
love
had
come
to
her
damaris
climbed
them
and
stood
on
the
roof
watching
as
had
watched
jill
carden
the
clouds
of
twittering
birds
as
they
flew
in
the
direction
of
the
libyan
hills
then
she
crossed
to
the
little
shrine
of
osiris
stood
for
a
moment
unconsciously
passing
her
finger
over
the
carvings
turned
as
though
someone
had
called
her
and
ran
down
the
stairs
she
stood
and
listened
until
she
heard
ellen
voice
looming
from
the
side
chapel
on
the
western
side
then
and
just
as
though
pulled
by
some
invisible
hand
she
passed
quietly
through
the
antechamber
into
the
sanctuary
where
in
the
days
of
ancient
egypt
the
mighty
pharaoh
and
he
only
entered
to
commune
with
the
gods
at
the
birth
of
the
new
year
and
where
the
mother
of
hugh
carden
ali
stricken
with
the
glory
of
the
secret
revealed
had
fallen
unconscious
to
the
ground
over
twenty
years
ago
she
stood
quite
still
her
heart
beating
to
suffocation
then
she
raised
her
hand
and
pushed
the
hair
from
her
forehead
i
feel
just
as
though
the
roof
was
pressing
down
upon
me
she
whispered
to
herself
as
though
through
me
something
awful
was
going
to
happen
i
she
turned
and
almost
ran
out
of
the
sanctuary
her
footsteps
waking
the
echoes
of
the
roof
which
once
had
resounded
to
the
clash
of
cymbal
the
roll
of
drum
and
blare
of
trumpets
she
heard
ellen
strident
voice
calling
to
her
telling
her
to
come
and
join
them
in
the
crypts
she
paid
no
heed
she
ran
on
and
out
into
the
sunshine
and
down
to
the
maid
who
was
still
placidly
crocheting
and
as
she
left
the
ruin
the
mantle
of
depression
fell
from
her
and
she
laughed
as
she
caught
the
great
dog
and
forced
him
to
walk
upon
his
no
janie
she
said
that
night
as
the
maid
tucked
her
up
in
bed
here
i
stay
until
i
have
visited
the
temple
thoroughly
and
i
take
you
down
into
the
creepy
crypts
and
lock
you
in
them
if
you
worry
any
more
we
all
got
up
too
early
and
had
had
enough
breakfast
that
is
why
we
disliked
the
place
so
much
they
stayed
some
days
and
then
took
the
public
steamer
home
damaris
bubbling
over
with
high
infectious
spirits
which
had
their
birth
in
a
secret
hope
that
she
might
find
a
letter
from
ben
kelham
upon
her
return
she
was
leaning
over
the
rail
thinking
about
him
as
the
boat
made
its
lazy
way
so
funny
she
was
saying
to
herself
as
they
approached
luxor
under
a
sunset
sky
i
wonder
if
he
will
be
at
the
hotel
i
somehow
feel
him
quite
near
and
then
her
thoughts
were
distracted
by
the
exclamations
and
laughter
of
the
passengers
as
they
rushed
to
the
side
causing
the
boat
to
take
a
distinct
list
what
little
things
serve
to
amuse
us
the
bluebottle
at
the
cathedral
service
the
stray
dog
which
rushes
athwart
the
regal
procession
the
straw
hat
blown
through
the
traffic
the
steamer
was
churning
up
the
waters
of
the
river
down
which
cleopatra
had
passed
in
all
her
power
and
beauty
on
each
side
were
the
ruins
of
temples
and
tombs
built
to
the
glory
of
great
god
or
mighty
emperor
yet
the
tourists
flung
down
and
left
their
tea
to
shout
encouragement
and
wave
their
handkerchiefs
to
ben
kelham
and
sybil
sidmouth
who
were
also
having
tea
on
the
slanting
deck
of
their
private
steamer
which
had
run
aground
on
the
pestiferous
sidmouth
in
the
seclusion
of
the
saloon
was
summoning
all
her
strength
for
a
real
damaris
looked
hard
for
a
moment
then
became
and
backed
her
way
out
through
the
crowd
she
flashed
a
quick
glance
round
in
search
of
the
thistletons
and
saw
them
leaning
dangerously
far
over
the
rail
trying
to
attract
the
attention
of
sybil
sidmouth
who
was
smiling
so
contentedly
as
she
handed
her
companion
his
tea
then
she
turned
to
run
to
the
saloon
to
hide
herself
and
ran
instead
right
into
jane
coop
arms
there
was
a
grim
set
to
the
maid
mouth
and
a
steely
glitter
in
her
eyes
i
was
just
coming
to
ask
you
dearie
if
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
one
gets
fair
sick
of
the
ruins
and
things
one
sees
on
this
river
the
young
ladies
can
come
and
find
you
at
tea
if
they
want
to
how
often
had
the
motherly
woman
gone
out
to
bring
in
the
lamb
from
the
storm
or
hunted
the
fields
and
hedgerows
for
her
straying
chick
later
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
darling
bed
and
patted
the
curly
head
resting
on
her
faithful
heart
to
the
accompaniment
of
little
clucking
sounds
there
now
dearie
there
now
there
now
it
is
worth
crying
over
every
river
is
as
full
of
good
fish
as
ever
sailed
on
it
in
a
boat
that
could
run
straight
let
old
nannie
dry
her
baby
tears
there
how
there
now
she
dried
the
little
face
with
a
big
handkerchief
and
rocked
her
child
to
the
rhythm
of
the
music
which
drifted
from
the
hall
borne
by
the
night
breeze
through
the
open
window
until
the
sobs
had
ceased
and
in
the
the
thistleton
family
nodded
their
heads
sagely
to
the
rhythm
of
the
same
music
i
am
sure
she
did
see
kelham
and
sybil
mamma
ellen
was
saying
she
was
having
tea
when
we
went
to
find
her
and
looked
quite
all
right
i
was
thankful
when
i
saw
her
broke
in
berenice
patting
a
thick
envelope
with
the
edinburgh
on
the
together
it
really
did
not
seem
il
at
all
and
wherever
sidmouth
was
she
might
have
countenanced
the
er
the
courtship
by
her
presence
on
deck
well
all
well
that
ends
well
said
mamma
placidly
as
she
secretly
returned
thanks
that
her
daughters
were
not
as
others
but
later
far
into
the
night
damaris
stood
at
her
window
with
her
arms
round
the
bulldog
neck
you
the
only
one
who
loves
me
everybody
else
run
away
and
leaves
me
i
i
so
unhappy
tears
stood
in
the
big
eyes
as
she
flung
out
her
arms
and
cried
in
a
sudden
passionate
intensity
i
want
you
i
want
you
if
you
loved
me
you
would
come
to
me
because
i
want
you
so
chapter

thorns
which
i
have
reap
are
of
the
tree
i
planted
they
have
torn
me
and
i
bleed
i
should
have
known
what
fruit
would
spring
from
such
a
byron
olivia
duchess
of
longacres
stood
on
the
balcony
of
the
hotel
looking
down
at
the
cortege
which
had
escorted
the
wife
of
the
sheik
from
the
house
mahabbah
some
way
out
in
the
desert
and
which
was
making
its
way
as
best
it
could
through
the
tortuous
narrow
unpaved
streets
of
khargegh
town
the
white
and
only
wife
of
the
great
arab
travelled
two
outriders
with
modern
rifles
slung
across
the
shoulder
and
brandishing
caused
consternation
amongst
the
spectators
as
at
a
word
or
touch
of
the
unspurred
foot
they
made
their
magnificent
horses
rear
and
back
and
plunge
one
trick
or
feat
had
caused
the
heavens
to
be
rent
with
screams
of
pure
joy
and
shouts
of
and
other
references
to
the
might
and
glory
of
the
almighty
you
do
not
often
see
this
feat
of
strength
and
dexterity
and
when
you
do
it
brings
your
heart
almost
out
of
your
body
and
has
an
exhibition
of
simply
beaten
to
a
frazzle
a
spectator
of
the
tender
age
of
three
clothed
as
it
was
a
day
of
festival
in
and
voluminous
robe
girt
about
him
with
a
cummerbund
on
ordinary
days
he
would
have
been
clothed
in
nature
and
girt
in
dirt
toddled
straight
into
the
middle
of
a
square
just
as
the
outriders
charged
across
it
there
was
no
room
for
them
to
turn
so
packed
were
the
places
where
the
sidewalks
should
have
been
neither
was
there
time
in
which
to
rein
in
their
horses
women
shrieked
and
beat
their
breasts
men
looked
on
at
the
inevitable
tragedy
with
the
composure
of
the
sterner
sex
the
babe
stood
and
yussuf
the
outrider
bending
low
on
his
saddle
drove
straight
down
upon
it
gathered
the
back
part
of
the
cummerbund
and
some
folds
of
the
voluminous
skirt
upon
the
point
of
his
spear
and
lifting
the
mite
amidst
yells
and
shouts
and
wild
clamour
carried
him
at
and
top
speed
safely
across
the
square
where
the
real
danger
comes
in
is
in
judging
the
exact
amount
of
stuff
to
gather
on
the
an
inch
or
so
too
much
and
you
may
get
a
part
of
the
kiddie
little
back
an
inch
or
so
too
little
and
when
you
have
him
high
in
air
you
may
cut
through
the
cloth
and
cause
said
kiddie
to
make
a
hasty
descent
to
anyway
the
child
was
safely
restored
to
its
fond
mother
who
simultaneously
smacked
it
and
stuffed
its
mouth
with
sweetmeats
and
became
the
hero
for
the
latter
part
of
the
day
the
real
cortège
was
headed
by
camels
bearing
gifts
from
the
house
to
the
great
white
woman
who
stood
on
the
balcony
in
a
grey
silk
taffeta
dress
a
shawl
of
priceless
lace
on
her
head
and
a
grey
parrot
upon
her
shoulder
silks
jewels
sweetmeats
in
ivory
and
precious
metal
dates
coffee
in
berries
a
monkey
and
a
bushel
of
wheat
were
amongst
the
gifts
carried
by
the
camels
who
grumbled
and
rumbled
as
they
stalked
with
swaying
gait
and
contemptuous
eyes
next
came
the
armed
escort
mounted
on
horses
with
modern
rifles
slung
and
cummerbunds
stuck
full
of
the
most
knives
they
scowled
at
everyone
but
as
they
passed
under
the
balcony
each
one
drew
his
knife
and
rattled
it
against
that
of
his
neighbour
so
that
the
weapons
made
a
glittering
arch
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
as
salutation
to
the
old
white
woman
who
was
of
their
mistress
race
came
mustapha
the
ethiopian
into
whose
care
the
sheikh
had
given
his
wife
all
those
years
ago
when
they
had
ridden
out
of
the
desert
up
to
his
dwelling
amongst
the
talik
palms
of
the
flat
oasis
he
was
on
foot
not
that
he
had
done
the
entire
journey
in
like
manner
and
held
the
golden
chain
of
the
magnificent
camel
upon
which
his
mistress
rode
she
rode
in
a
palanquin
of
ivory
with
curtains
of
rose
satin
embroidered
in
precious
stones
on
either
side
also
on
camels
rode
two
slaves
who
waved
huge
circular
fans
on
long
staffs
to
cool
the
air
about
this
woman
who
was
so
beloved
throughout
the
land
for
her
good
deeds
and
loving
helping
hand
she
was
in
silk
robes
of
rose
covered
in
a
satin
cloak
of
deeper
shade
she
was
closely
veiled
as
becomes
the
wife
of
a
mohammedan
and
wore
no
jewels
save
a
rope
of
pearls
and
her
steady
wonderful
blue
eyes
which
were
just
twin
heavens
of
happiness
shone
with
delight
as
she
looked
up
at
the
old
woman
who
had
known
her
as
a
girl
with
her
hair
hanging
in
two
great
plaits
she
put
both
hands
to
her
forehead
and
spread
them
out
in
the
beautiful
eastern
gesture
of
welcome
then
bowed
to
her
knees
as
she
passed
then
turning
she
pulled
her
yashmak
a
little
to
one
side
she
cried
welcome
and
blew
her
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
rosy
fingers
arrived
at
the
entrance
the
armed
escort
made
a
circle
round
her
with
drawn
knives
her
camel
knelt
a
persian
carpet
was
laid
across
the
stones
then
mustapha
the
ethiopian
made
a
sign
upon
which
ameena
the
little
hunchback
woman
who
loved
her
mistress
more
than
her
life
and
who
had
been
transported
with
joy
when
she
had
laid
the
the
son
in
the
mother
arms
came
running
swiftly
mustapha
and
ameena
lived
one
long
life
of
secret
feud
they
fought
like
cat
and
dog
as
to
who
could
do
the
most
in
their
service
they
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
fought
everybody
else
in
the
same
good
cause
and
the
huge
man
scowled
fiercely
as
the
deformed
little
woman
arranged
the
flowing
robes
and
walked
up
the
persian
carpet
behind
the
wife
of
the
great
sheikh
well
i
never
was
hobson
comment
as
she
peeked
from
behind
a
door
her
grace
must
have
made
a
mistake
you
take
that
downstairs
she
added
coming
boldly
out
onto
the
landing
to
intercept
the
slave
with
the
monkey
downstairs
and
she
pointed
down
to
the
entrance
surging
with
people
unless
you
want
the
place
to
be
full
of
feathers
and
fur
jill
stood
in
the
doorway
looked
across
at
her
godmother
and
made
the
beautiful
gesture
of
salutation
then
removed
her
veil
picked
up
her
robes
and
ran
across
the
room
right
into
the
outstretched
arms
tears
were
very
close
as
they
laughed
and
held
each
other
by
the
hand
but
the
laughter
died
away
altogether
as
they
sat
in
the
falling
shadows
the
younger
one
with
her
head
on
the
older
one
lap
two
wise
women
they
were
fighting
for
the
happiness
of
the
young
as
the
shadows
fell
and
the
stars
came
out
and
faded
before
the
light
of
the
moon
as
she
trailed
her
silver
garments
across
the
heavens
jill
had
risen
once
to
her
feet
in
a
moment
of
anger
and
had
gone
out
onto
the
balcony
and
stood
looking
down
smiling
upon
the
crowd
composed
chiefly
of
women
who
had
raised
their
hands
and
called
down
the
blessings
of
allah
upon
her
the
steps
were
strewn
with
gifts
ranging
from
live
goats
to
masses
of
sticky
sweetmeats
and
glass
beads
mothers
had
brought
their
sickly
babies
and
laid
them
down
amongst
the
goats
and
beads
hoping
that
if
even
the
shadow
of
the
blessed
woman
were
to
fall
upon
them
they
might
be
healed
mustapha
kept
guard
hurling
abuse
at
those
who
tarried
helping
their
departure
by
the
aid
of
his
foot
hobson
stood
like
a
grim
sentinel
outside
the
door
she
had
made
tea
under
the
greatest
difficulty
the
kettle
of
tepid
water
had
been
flung
at
the
salaaming
offender
who
had
brought
it
and
had
taken
it
in
blushing
when
jill
had
risen
and
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
dinner
had
been
served
hardly
tasted
and
been
sent
away
and
a
whole
tray
of
cups
full
of
burnt
milk
showed
the
perturbation
of
the
maid
mind
as
she
waited
and
waited
for
the
sound
of
the
little
bell
which
summoned
her
to
her
grace
presence
you
are
a
woman
my
child
said
the
duchess
as
she
keenly
scrutinised
the
fair
face
with
great
blue
eyes
and
broad
humourous
mouth
which
but
for
an
added
serenity
and
dignity
was
so
very
like
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
been
left
behind
at
ismailiah
over
twenty
years
ago
and
who
had
journeyed
into
the
desert
with
the
arabian
sheikh
and
had
married
him
i
not
surprised
your
husband
adores
you
could
he
not
have
come
with
you
i
have
always
longed
to
see
him
it
seemed
that
the
sheikh
hahmed
had
been
invited
to
bagdad
to
some
conference
concerning
the
big
arabian
question
but
hoped
to
be
able
to
greet
her
grace
before
her
departure
in
the
meanwhile
his
dwellings
his
servants
his
horses
and
everything
he
was
possessed
of
were
hers
and
he
means
it
he
loves
making
people
happy
i
i
him
she
paused
for
a
moment
then
looked
straight
into
the
stern
old
eyes
my
love
for
my
son
is
as
great
as
my
love
for
his
father
and
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
their
happiness
there
was
no
tenderness
in
the
sad
old
eyes
and
no
lines
of
yielding
in
the
stern
old
mouth
for
although
her
heart
was
aching
to
say
yes
to
the
mother
insistent
demands
for
her
son
happiness
her
common
sense
had
turned
her
into
a
very
rock
of
resistance
i
am
happy
radiantly
happy
jill
who
was
sitting
on
a
stool
at
the
old
woman
feet
slipped
to
her
knees
and
caught
the
wrinkled
old
hands
in
her
own
so
why
should
the
little
girl
not
be
happy
with
my
son
who
is
the
finest
man
and
dearest
son
ever
born
to
woman
tell
me
what
difference
is
there
why
should
my
son
be
made
unhappy
tell
me
she
knew
perfectly
well
her
son
words
on
the
roof
of
his
dwelling
under
the
stars
were
ringing
in
her
ears
but
she
was
hanging
on
to
a
very
forlorn
hope
with
both
hands
tricking
herself
with
the
thought
that
out
of
her
love
for
her
the
wise
old
woman
might
see
things
in
a
different
light
and
give
her
consent
to
the
marriage
just
because
the
man
was
her
son
but
the
old
woman
caught
the
mother
to
her
breast
and
stroked
the
golden
head
and
kissed
it
with
a
world
of
pain
in
her
sad
old
eyes
because
dear
and
the
words
were
very
gentle
and
the
voice
was
very
soft
just
because
when
we
love
we
think
of
ourselves
only
and
not
of
those
to
come
the
old
woman
sighed
as
jill
raised
her
head
sharply
try
to
understand
little
one
you
my
dear
a
white
woman
married
a
arab
ah
my
dear
my
dear
forgive
me
your
son
is
jill
sprang
to
her
feet
and
as
she
sprang
caught
the
rope
of
pearls
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
breaking
it
and
scattering
the
jewels
to
the
four
corners
of
the
room
she
flung
out
her
hands
making
the
eastern
sign
to
scare
away
evil
spirits
the
omen
she
whispered
the
omen
a
broken
string
of
pearls
means
means
death
come
come
child
said
the
old
lady
sharply
and
to
allay
the
unsightly
terror
in
the
other
face
and
also
because
she
believed
in
using
an
axe
in
felling
a
tree
repeated
her
last
remark
you
are
suffering
now
through
the
selfishness
of
love
women
who
marry
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
result
of
the
marriage
to
the
good
or
the
harm
it
might
bring
to
the
children
of
that
marriage
deserve
to
suffer
marry
the
man
if
you
really
love
him
and
can
help
him
by
being
his
wife
but
let
there
be
no
children
if
there
is
anything
in
the
union
that
might
hurt
them
she
rose
and
crossed
to
the
girl
who
was
standing
staring
into
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
world
of
horror
in
her
eyes
she
moved
back
as
the
old
woman
came
towards
her
holding
out
her
hands
as
though
to
ward
off
some
evil
thing
she
saw
in
the
shadows
i
ca
bear
it
she
whispered
i
ca
bear
it
i
do
believe
that
anyone
could
think
of
hugh
remember
how
loved
he
was
at
harrow
ah
my
dear
my
dear
there
was
your
great
mistake
you
wrong
interrupted
jill
harshly
you
hopelessly
cruelly
wrong
he
was
idolised
in
england
he
is
loved
out
here
it
was
sheer
spite
on
the
part
of
the
woman
who
told
him
that
he
was
was
she
pressed
her
hands
over
her
mouth
as
she
backed
to
the
wall
then
flung
her
arms
out
wide
her
face
was
her
eyes
blazing
she
reminded
the
old
woman
of
a
tigress
fighting
for
her
cubs
she
was
beautiful
beyond
words
in
the
tragedy
of
her
motherhood
i
believe
you
i
do
believe
you
i
you
listen
jill
the
old
woman
voice
was
as
cold
as
ice
as
she
watched
the
agony
in
the
fair
face
dear
heavens
she
did
not
want
to
hurt
she
wanted
to
give
in
and
gather
the
child
up
in
her
arms
but
she
knew
what
was
best
your
boy
knows
it
dear
he
knows
he
is
out
of
the
running
come
over
to
me
and
listen
whilst
i
tell
you
something
she
sat
down
and
pulled
the
suffering
child
down
beside
her
who
lay
across
the
silken
knees
like
the
stricken
mother
across
the
knees
of
the
wise
madonna
and
made
no
sound
or
movement
whilst
she
listened
to
the
bitter
words
of
the
in
the
hotel
garden
at
cairo
a
little
silence
fell
then
very
gently
very
tenderly
the
old
woman
spoke
so
you
see
dear
until
she
is
of
age
it
will
be
only
my
duty
to
see
that
damaris
does
not
marry
your
son
and
jill
sprang
to
her
feet
and
beat
her
hands
together
and
i
she
said
i
will
give
my
heart
blood
to
bring
happiness
to
my
son
death
alone
shall
she
stopped
and
shivered
as
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
out
into
the
night
then
drew
herself
up
with
a
surpassing
dignity
and
threw
out
her
hands
in
the
eastern
gesture
of
resignation
you
say
will
not
i
say
will
but
it
is
god
who
decides
with
a
little
sobbing
sigh
she
relinquished
the
unequal
struggle
just
as
hobson
walked
boldly
into
the
room
and
stood
inside
the
door
like
a
graven
image
of
intense
displeasure
when
her
mistress
unable
to
withstand
the
unspoken
disapproval
consented
after
a
promise
to
jill
to
have
another
long
talk
on
the
morrow
to
go
to
bed
but
there
was
to
be
no
long
talk
anyway
in
the
town
of
khargegh
on
the
morrow
she
lay
in
bed
propped
by
pillows
against
which
divested
of
its
mask
of
red
and
white
and
blue
the
dear
little
old
face
shone
brown
a
priceless
bit
of
lace
hid
her
own
white
locks
free
for
the
night
of
the
outrageous
perruque
which
covered
them
by
day
and
which
lay
at
the
moment
hidden
in
its
box
a
pair
of
crimson
peeped
from
under
the
bed
another
pair
absurdly
small
outrageously
buckled
and
crimson
made
a
splash
of
colour
near
the
her
little
hands
were
gently
folded
under
the
ruffles
of
priceless
lace
of
her
cashmere
as
she
lay
quite
still
trying
to
find
a
way
out
through
the
jungle
of
pain
and
grief
which
seemed
to
spread
round
and
about
so
many
she
loved
whilst
dekko
puffed
out
with
sleepiness
sat
on
the
back
of
a
chair
muttering
incoherently
to
some
fanciful
image
of
his
weird
brain
hobson
lay
fast
asleep
in
the
next
room
which
had
a
communicating
door
with
that
of
her
mistress
knowing
nothing
of
nerves
or
of
temperament
she
had
dropped
asleep
as
soon
as
her
head
with
scanty
locks
tortured
into
a
of
steel
pins
had
touched
the
pillow
her
strong
hands
were
clenched
on
the
frill
of
her
stout
calico
nightdress
her
powerful
face
looked
grim
in
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
which
high
in
the
heavens
flung
a
silver
shaft
through
the
open
window
straight
across
the
bed
there
was
absolutely
no
sound
when
just
as
so
many
miles
away
damaris
made
her
passionate
appeal
as
she
stood
by
the
window
hobson
dour
stolid
unimaginative
yet
with
a
streak
of
scotch
blood
in
her
veins
sat
straight
up
in
bed
her
eyes
were
wide
open
as
she
stared
in
front
of
her
then
she
passed
her
powerful
hand
over
her
grim
face
and
flung
the
bedclothes
to
one
side
she
in
trouble
she
spoke
very
clearly
sat
for
a
moment
thinking
then
reached
for
a
puce
trimmed
mulberry
i
go
and
tell
her
and
the
infinite
love
in
the
pronoun
was
good
to
hear
she
understand
the
duchess
turned
her
head
as
the
door
opened
slowly
but
made
no
movement
although
her
heart
suddenly
quickened
its
beat
yes
she
said
quietly
hobson
walked
up
to
the
bed
and
took
one
of
the
little
old
hands
between
her
own
powerful
ones
miss
damaris
wants
you
she
spoke
with
certain
conviction
then
added
i
had
a
dream
i
saw
nothing
but
i
heard
miss
damaris
calling
you
it
woke
me
up
she
said
want
you
that
was
all
and
she
does
she
stood
patting
the
hand
of
her
mistress
who
lay
for
a
moment
quite
still
then
the
faithful
creature
put
a
shetland
shawl
round
the
bent
shoulders
as
the
old
lady
sat
straight
up
in
bed
would
you
please
find
miss
jill
maid
she
used
the
term
of
the
past
when
jill
carden
had
stayed
at
the
castle
and
had
teased
hobson
to
death
and
ask
her
to
tell
her
mistress
that
i
should
be
pleased
if
she
could
find
it
convenient
to
come
to
my
room
for
a
moment
hobson
found
the
aged
lying
asleep
outside
her
door
ameena
had
learned
a
few
words
of
the
english
language
in
the
last
twenty
years
but
not
enough
to
allow
her
to
understand
the
terrifying
person
who
stood
over
her
so
that
she
shook
her
head
whilst
hobson
repeated
her
request
over
and
over
again
and
ever
more
distinctly
until
it
ended
at
last
in
a
veritable
shout
which
brought
jill
who
had
not
slept
for
the
ache
in
her
to
the
door
for
a
moment
she
stood
a
beautiful
picture
with
big
questioning
eyes
and
two
great
plaits
of
auburn
hair
hanging
down
over
her
satin
wrap
then
she
ran
down
the
corridor
and
into
her
godmother
bedroom
in
an
hour
those
two
forceful
women
had
made
their
plans
acting
without
hesitation
upon
what
might
so
easily
have
been
the
outcome
of
digestive
trouble
on
maria
hobson
part
fully
clothed
the
two
maids
entered
her
grace
bedroom
the
one
carrying
the
and
the
other
a
plate
of
biscuits
ameena
said
jill
who
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
bed
please
go
and
find
mustapha
tell
him
to
go
to
the
station
find
the
and
give
him
this
letter
we
want
a
special
train
as
soon
as
possible
mustapha
is
to
bring
me
a
written
reply
from
the
she
spoke
with
the
authority
of
the
eastern
potentate
and
took
no
notice
of
the
maid
when
she
knelt
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
satin
wrap
give
me
a
cigarette
hobson
said
her
grace
in
the
depths
of
whose
eyes
twinkled
the
star
of
humour
we
shall
be
starting
as
soon
as
possible
maybe
directly
after
breakfast
for
luxor
yes
your
grace
i
will
begin
the
packing
said
the
imperturbable
hobson
placing
the
tray
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
and
when
you
have
had
your
tea
will
you
try
and
get
a
little
sleep
you
can
leave
everything
safely
to
me
but
special
trains
do
not
grow
like
blackberries
upon
a
side
line
in
the
east
so
that
many
weary
hours
passed
before
they
set
out
upon
the
return
journey
which
was
rendered
infinitely
tedious
by
the
mistakes
which
got
them
shunted
into
sidings
to
allow
the
ordinary
trains
to
pass

watchmen
that
went
about

found
me
they
smote
me
they
wounded
me
the
keepers
of
the

took
away
my
veil
from
song
of

the
night
before
ben

return
to

zulannah
sat
on
a
pile
of
cushions
with
her
back
to
the
crumbling
plaster
wall
in
the
filthy
hovel
she
had
completely
recovered
and
save
for
the
excruciating
pain
caused
by
the
shrunken
muscles
when
she
moved
was
as
sound
as
a
bell
and
likely
to
live
to
a
ripe
old
age
slave
to
her
whilom
servant
who
sat
on
his
heels
inhaling
the
fumes
of
the
which
his
heart
had
always
coveted
it
is
useless
writing
about
the
hell
through
which
the
woman
had
lived
from
the
moment
she
had
returned
to
consciousness
besides
there
are
some
things
which
words
can
not
describe
and
which
in
any
case
are
best
left
alone
not
even
to
the
imagination
she
was
absolutely
in
the
power
of
the
negroid
brute
with
the
destruction
of
her
beauty
she
had
lost
everything
save
what
she
had
in
the
bank
and
from
the
heaps
of
little
canvas
bags
in
a
corner
and
little
piles
of
banknotes
under
the
straw
she
knew
that
some
day
that
too
must
come
to
an
end
she
had
loved
her
jewels
loved
the
shimmering
pearls
and
sparkling
diamonds
and
had
found
her
greatest
joy
in
dipping
her
hand
into
a
leather
bag
filled
with
unset
stones
how
often
had
she
sat
in
the
luxury
of
her
bedroom
revelling
in
the
trickle
of
the
rubies
sapphires
and
emeralds
from
between
her
fingers
into
her
lap
even
those
she
had
lost
the
milner
safe
stood
open
showing
empty
shelves
and
she
shuddered
yet
at
the
memory
of
the
frightful
scene
which
had
followed
her
refusal
to
open
it
she
loved
jewels
wanted
them
for
their
beauty
had
fought
the
negro
for
them
but
there
was
one
thing
she
clung
to
even
more
and
that
was
life
so
that
when
the
huge
hands
had
slowly
so
very
slowly
pressed
upon
her
neck
she
had
given
in
and
setting
the
combination
had
swung
the
door
slowly
back
and
qatim
with
fright
thinking
that
it
had
been
worked
by
the
power
of
a
or
devil
had
flung
her
out
into
the
night
and
having
scraped
a
hole
in
the
foetid
earth
under
the
straw
with
fervent
prayers
to
whatever
he
worshipped
had
withdrawn
the
jewels
hidden
them
and
called
the
woman
back
yes
she
clung
to
life
strange
is
it
how
we
do
even
when
youth
and
beauty
and
health
have
passed
from
us
how
crippled
and
unlovely
twisted
of
temper
or
limb
with
failing
senses
in
or
propped
on
sticks
we
hang
on
to
the
last
thread
when
surely
we
ought
to
be
so
thankful
to
snap
it
and
be
away
to
whatever
our
lives
here
have
prepared
for
us
over
the
border
not
a
shame
not
a
loss
for
him
in
this
clay
carcase
crippled
to
abide
well
might
old
omar
ponder
upon
this
but
zulannah
had
a
good
reason
for
clinging
to
life
in
spite
of
the
greatness
of
her
debacle
the
metal
of
which
had
been
wrought
the
one
love
that
had
come
to
her
in
her
short
life
had
not
been
able
to
withstand
the
crucible
of
physical
pain
for
hours
and
days
she
had
writhed
in
the
agony
of
her
physical
injury
with
no
one
to
care
if
she
suffered
or
starved
except
the
ethiopian
who
when
her
senses
had
come
back
to
her
had
twitted
her
upon
her
failure
in
her
had
tormented
and
mocked
and
laughed
until
a
great
wish
for
revenge
had
taken
the
place
of
her
former
love
for
the
englishman
revenge
above
all
things
on
the
girl
who
had
been
capable
of
inspiring
love
in
two
such
men
revenge
on
the
white
man
who
had
really
been
the
primary
cause
of
her
downfall
but
a
lingering
hellish
revenge
if
she
could
only
think
of
one
for
the
man
who
had
given
the
order
to
the
dogs
just
because
she
had
reviled
the
white
girl
damaris
so
she
sat
on
the
pile
of
cushions
smoking
the
cheapest
cigarette
of
the
bazaar
whilst
her
cunning
brain
wove
plots
around
the
astounding
news
qatim
had
just
imparted
they
were
perfectly
free
from
interruption
the
door
was
barred
and
the
small
aperture
which
served
as
window
was
too
highly
placed
in
the
wall
to
allow
of
eyes
to
peep
but
it
was
superstition
that
really
kept
them
safe
and
proved
far
more
potent
as
a
barrier
against
their
neighbours
curiosity
than
any
wall
qatim
had
given
out
that
the
woman
was
bewitched
and
that
death
instantaneous
and
horrible
would
be
the
fate
awaiting
anyone
but
himself
who
should
speak
to
her
or
look
upon
her
unveiled
face
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
some
of
us
christians
refuse
to
walk
under
ladders
and
although
it
entailed
much
fetching
and
carrying
and
marketing
on
his
part
still
it
ensured
them
solitude
and
you
saw
him
she
spoke
with
a
sibilant
intaking
of
breath
caused
by
the
twist
to
her
mouth
yes
with
a
beautiful

woman

shook
her
head
and
turning
it
so
that
the
wounds
and
distortion
were
hidden
leant
against
the
wall
not
yet
she
said
loosening
with
filthy
hand
the
uncombed
masses
of
hair
which
still
retained
something
of
the
perfume
of
better
days
not
let
me
think
awhile
and
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
man
who
sat
staring
at
her
breathing
heavily
the
right
side
of
her
face
untouched
and
perfect
showed
in
all
its
beauty
against
the
dirty
whiteness
of
the
wall
her
hair
served
as
a
mantle
to
the
perfect
figure
in
the
soiled
satin
wrap
her
crippled
limbs
showed
not
at
all
in
the
foul
room
lit
by
a
wick
floating
in
a

light
went

near
the
balustrade
on
the
verandah
of

hotel
just
after
breakfast
pretending
to
read
the
morning
paper
whilst
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
sybil
sidmouth
and
her
mother
owing
to
lack
of
accommodation
brought
about
by
the
crush
of
visitors
in
the
huge
caravanserai
had
gone
to
the
savoy
for
which
the
man
was
secretly
thankful
he
wanted
to
eat
out
his
heart
all
by
himself
in
the
appalling
loneliness
which
had
overwhelmed
him
when
on
ringing
up
heliopolis
the
night
before
he
had
learned
that
damaris
and
the
duchess
had
transferred
themselves
to
luxor
and
you
simply
can
not
indulge
in
your
particular
brand
of
or
dolour
with
an
extreme
optimist
sitting
opposite
you
at
meals
or
adjacent
to
your
elbow
at
most
other
times
he
anathematised
the
postal
system
of
egypt
his
own
haste
in
accepting
the
girl
refusal
the
oriental
imagination
which
magnified
cats
into
lions
but
above
all
the
wash
of
that
steamer
upon
which
damaris
had
returned
from
denderah
which
had
his
own
craft
and
sent
him
racing
full
steam
ahead
for
cairo
another
hour
of
the
infernal
wait
on
the
sandbank
and
he
would
have
transferred
himself
to
one
of
the
scores
of
small
boats
and
been
ferried
across
to
luxor
where
he
would
have
dined
at
the
winter
palace
hotel
whilst
waiting
to
catch
the
express
to
cairo
and
perhaps
have
seen
his
beloved
in
the
or
have
heard
that
she
was
staying
there
he
was
thoroughly
irritated
as
he
pondered
in
his
deliberate
way
as
to
the
best
thing
to
do
should
he
take
the
first
train
back
to
luxor
or
as
the
duchess
had
not
seen
fit
to
acquaint
him
as
to
her
movements
should
he
stay
where
he
was
write
her
a
letter
or
send
a
telegram
and
wait
for
an
answer
anyway
he
was
irritated
enough
to
scowl
at
the
commissionaire
who
was
rating
a
woman
whom
he
had
seen
hanging
about
the
street
doubtless
with
intent
of
soliciting
a
nickel
coin
from
one
of
the
great
white
race
as
he
or
she
descended
the
steps
to
stroll
along
the
street
she
made
a
few
choice
remarks
upon
the
undoubted
inclusion
of
a
pig
in
the
commissionaire
parentage
in
a
curiously
sibilant
voice
then
limped
away
with
a
distressing
swing
of
her
body
from
the
hips
ca
you
keep
those
people
quiet
kelham
demanded
angrily
as
he
moved
a
chair
further
back
and
lit
a
cigarette
an
hour
had
passed
in
which
he
had
come
to
no
decision
when
fate
in
the
shape
of
a
offered
him
the
local
morning
paper
which
he
took
and
read
with
only
half
a
mind
upon
the
gossipy
contents
by
jove
he
suddenly
exclaimed
if
that
is
a
bit
of
luck
here
the
very
excuse
for
getting
down
there
without
kind
of
thrusting
myself
upon
them
he
flattened
out
the
paper
and
again
read
through
the
paragraph
which
gave
a
most
extraordinarily
detailed
account
of
the
immensely
wealthy
hugh
carden
ali
his
career
at
harrow
his
travels
his
stables
in
the
desert
his
birds
and
a
hundred
and
one
other
details
calculated
to
interest
those
who
like
reading
about
other
people
most
intimate
affairs
it
ended
being
a
great
sportsman
the
strange
story
of
lion
which
is
causing
such
uneasiness
and
is
likely
to
do
harm
to
the
luxor
season
has
taken
him
to
his
tents
of
purple
and
gold
one
of
the
wonders
of
modern
egypt
and
which
lie
in
the
desert
a
little
distance
from
the
colossi
he
did
not
frown
this
time
as
he
folded
the
paper
and
turned
to
watch
the
commissionaire
in
conclave
with
a
ethiopian
who
clad
in
crimson
tunic
enormous
turban
and
with
scimitar
rattling
at
his
side
tendered
an
envelope
yes
yes
said
the
hotel
servant
i
will
see
that
it
is
delivered
into
the
gentleman

hands
and
tell
me
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
winked
his
eye

she
returned
from
alexandria
qatim
was
caught
in
a
quandary
and
he
cursed
the
vanity
which
had
urged
him
to
don
his
most
resplendent
garments
upon
his
errand
to
the
great
hotel
to
which
he
had
come
after
a
violent
argument
with
zulannah
with
a
heart
full
of
hatred
and
agony
in
her
twisted
limbs
the
woman
had
hung
about
the
streets
in
front
of
the
hotel
until
she
had
seen
the
man
for
whom
she
had
felt
such
a
sudden
and
fleeting
love
and
who
was
the
primary
cause
of
her
disfigurement
hurt
him
she
must
if
only
as
a
balm
to
her
own
physical
and
mental
agony
and
in
what
better
way
than
by
destroying
his
faith
in
the
white
girl
he
loved
hence
the
letter
written
hastily
in
the
hovel
and
consigned
to
the
care
of
the
ethiopian
who
in
return
for
his
assistance
had
demanded
backshisch
in
the
shape
of
a
pink
leaf
covered
with
strange
black
marks
the
woman
presence
in
the
great
city
in
her
deplorable
state
was
the
last
thing
he
wanted
to
be
known
so
he
lied
clumsily
nay
she
is
in
alexandria
he
blurted
out
the
commissionaire
slowly
winked
an
eye
perhaps
he
said
perhaps
not
and
chuckled
as
the
negro
turned
hastily
and
strode
away
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
and
thus
came
it
to
be
known
in
the
bazaar
that
zulannah
the
courtesan
had
returned
to
the
great
city
and
a
little
later
ben
kelham
felt
no
tweak
at
the
string
with
which
fate
had
hobbled
him
to
his
destiny
when
on
hearing
his
number
called
he
took
the
letter
from
the
turned
it
over
and
looked
at
it
on
each
side
as
we
do
when
curious
but
not
then
he
opened
it
idly
read
it
and
crushed
it
in
both
hands
it
was
written
in
the
execrable
english
zulannah
had
picked
up
in
her
few
years
of
cosmopolitan
intercourse
with
different
nationalities
it
was
in
vile
and
was
as
despicable
a
method
of
revenge
as
an
anonymous
letter
usually
is
it
ran
after
this
fashion
if
you
want
to
find
your
white
woman
go
and
look
for
her
in
the
ruins
of
karnak
at
night
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
hugh
carden
ali
and
the
woman
who
had
limped
back
to
the
street
sniggered
behind
her
veil
as
she
watched
the
man
tear
the
letter
into
shreds
while
he
sat
and
thought
out
an
answer
to
this
second
problem
it
a
damnable
lie
my
damaris
and
good
old
carden
i
expect
they
met
but
who
he
sniffed
at
his
hands
suddenly
pah
now
where
have
i
smelt
that
scent
before
filth
he
sat
with
his
hands
to
his
nose
then
frowned
as
under
the
suggestion
of
the
perfume
the
picture
of
a
lovely
woman
clad
in
silks
and
satins
and
wearing
rich
jewels
rose
before
him
my
god
he
said
slowly
as
the
full
significance
of
it
all
dawned
slowly
upon
him
of
course
she
she
invited
me
to
to
visit
her
and
i
refused
by
all
that
clean
and
decent
if
i
do
make
her
pay
for
this
and
it
carden
too
who
can
tell
me
the
best
way
to
set
about
it
the
harlot
i
wonder
if
i
shall
have
to
wait
until
evening
for
a
train
he
clenched
his
hands
until
the
knuckles
showed
white
as
he
unseeingly
watched
a
woman
limp
down
the
street
make
her
sorry
she
was
ever
born
he
need
not
have
worried
on
that
point
fate
was
dogging
those
unsteady
feet
back
to
the
hovel
the
spreading
of
a
prairie
fire
is
slow
compared
to
the
speed
with
which
news
runs
through
the
bazaar
the
servants
in
the
big
house
in
the
big
garden
went
sullenly
about
their
various
tasks
of
tidying
and
clearing
up
the
courtesan
home
whilst
little
knots
of
people
composed
principally
of
women
stood
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
gate
it
was
the
first
time
the
tyrannical
woman
had
been
absent
upon
a
long
journey
and
the
relatives
and
friends
even
unto
a
most
distant
generation
of
her
servants
had
taken
advantage
of
it
to
visit
the
house
and
examine
its
to
them
surpassing
luxury
the
ethiopian
with
his
mind
fixed
only
upon
the
bank
had
taken
but
little
interest
in
the
house
itself
and
had
visited
it
but
rarely
and
then
only
for
the
sake
of
appearances
so
that
the
visitors
had
become
more
and
more
brazen
as
the
days
passed
fingering
the
satins
sitting
upon
the
cushions
feasting
on
the
floor
bes
the
monstrous
keeper
of
the
lions
had
become
prime
favourite
with
the
men
and
the
neighbourhood
had
resounded
with
the
roars
of
the
brutes
at
night
as
they
fought
for
their
food
also
was
there
something
savage
in
the
way
the
women
visitors
had
fingered
and
touched
everything
and
had
visited
every
corner
of
the
building
they
were
fat
or
thin
plain
or
passably
they
were
all
hideously
poor
and
in
their
heads
they
had
the
echo
of
the
gibes
their
menfolk
had
cast
at
them
when
returning
with
empty
pockets
they
had
boasted
of
great
conquests
which
boasting
the
sillies
had
believed
thinking
as
all
women
think
that
their
own
particular
male
has
been
specially
favoured
of
the
gods
and
is
therefore
an
adonis
in
the
eyes
of
every
other
woman
there
was
an
indefinite
air
of
trouble
in
that
quarter
of
the
bazaar
which
increased
with
the
heat
of
the
day
household
matters
were
neglected
whilst
the
women
foregathered
to
talk
words
were
few
but
gestures
were
quick
and
expressive
the
servants
wondering
at
the
absence
of
the
ethiopian
grumbled
as
they
worked
they
had
been
paid
no
wages
in
their
mistress
absence
and
were
on
the
verge
of
mutiny
brave
words
when
they
knew
that
they
would
fall
flat
upon
their
faces
at
the
first
swish
of
her
satin
robes
they
waited
all
the
day
and
no
definite
word
came
of
the
return
they
waited
until
the
stars
twinkled
and
they
still
waited
with
the
terrible
patience
of
the
east
why
they
waited
they
could
not
have
told
you
they
dared
not
set
upon
her
if
she
passed
in
her
litter
she
wielded
too
great
a
power
through
her
beauty
and
wealth
for
that
but
as
the
hours
passed
they
moved
softly
to
and
fro
as
moves
the
wretched
beast
in
his
cage
at
whilst
a
look
of
cunning
allied
to
cruelty
shone
in
the
soft
brown
eyes
it
only
required
a
spark

the
station
was
bathed
in
the
of
the
wonderful
sunset
which
being
a
daily
occurrence
is
hardly
ever
noticed
by
the
winter
visitors
in
cairo
a
star
or
two
twinkled
in
the
pale
grey
hem
of
the
coat
of
many
colours
which
day
was
offering
to
night
as
the
evening
breeze
lifted
the
edges
of
the
veils
and
blew
refreshingly
around
a
woman
who
descended
awkwardly
from
a
native
cart
and
limped
her
way
across
the
station
yard
the
porter
trundling
ben
luggage
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
and
likening
her
to
the
offspring
of
a
clumsy
flung
her
to
one
side
rage
incarnate
glared
from
her
eyes
bitter
vituperation
flowed
from
behind
the
yashmak
until
noticing
that
a
swashbuckling
member
of
the
native
police
was
making
his
menacing
way
towards
her
she
quieted
down
and
limped
to
where
she
saw
standing
the
station
porter
of
hotel
strange
is
that
power
which
has
led
so
many
a
criminal
to
the
gallows
by
dragging
him
irresistibly
back
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
it
was
some
such
force
which
had
held
zulannah
throughout
the
day
she
had
nothing
further
to
gain
by
looking
upon
the
man
who
had
unconsciously
been
the
cause
of
her
ruin
she
had
done
her
best
to
retaliate
by
blighting
the
love
she
had
herself
tried
to
gain
but
she
had
been
mastered
by
a
morbid
desire
to
look
just
once
more
upon
ben
kelham
hoping
to
be
able
to
trace
in
his
face
some
sign
of
his
mental
hurt
the
suffering
of
innocent
people
and
animals
had
always
given
her
intense
pleasure
how
much
greater
therefore
her
satisfaction
if
she
could
bring
and
gloat
over
bodily
or
mental
pain
to
someone
who
had
made
her
suffer
she
hung
about
until
she
saw
ben
kelham
arrive
and
stood
quite
close
to
him
chuckling
inwardly
at
the
tale
told
by
the
grim
set
of
his
mouth
zulannah
was
dirty
her
hands
were
her
fine
muslin
veils
filthy
and
torn
but
there
still
hung
about
her
the
faint
odour
of
the
perfume
she
had
always
used
in
the
of
her
success
the
passing
of
a
barrow
piled
high
with
luggage
disturbed
her
veils
and
as
the
rush
of
some
excited
natives
disturbed
the
air
ben
kelham
swung
around
he
had
suddenly
scented
the
perfume
of
zulannah
the
courtesan
he
looked
to
right
to
left
and
all
about
him
eyed
with
disfavour
the
dirty
woman
so
close
to
him
who
stood
crookedly
with
an
evil
leer
to
one
eye
frowned
and
walked
away
to
the
platform
from
which
the
train
starts
for
luxor
all
stations
in
the
east
are
invariably
and
most
uncomfortably
crowded
with
natives
who
either
stray
hopelessly
after
the
manner
of
lost
sheep
or
stand
as
hopelessly
incapable
of
movement
or
rush
at
the
sound
of
clanging
bell
or
shriek
from
locomotive
but
the
station
was
unduly
crowded
this
evening
owing
to
the
return
of
hundreds
of
pilgrims
from
a
visit
to
a
certain
shrine
in
the
countryside
and
an
influx
of
their
friends
and
relations
from
the
bazaar
to
greet
them
the
strong
electric
lights
were
blazing
intensifying
the
vivid
colours
and
modifying
the
dirt
upon
what
was
intended
to
be
the
white
portions
of
the
natives
picturesque
raiment
they
shone
down
also
upon
the
disfigured
woman
who
with
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
in
her
heart
brought
about
by
the
grim
look
on
ben
kelham
face
was
limping
towards
the
exit
she
had
just
reached
it
when
her
veil
was
caught
on
the
rough
wicker
of
a
basket
containing
hens
which
was
being
carried
on
the
back
of
a
man
whose
mean
hovel
which
yet
had
been
his
home
had
been
razed
to
the
ground
to
allow
of
the
building
of
the
house
he
had
stood
the
best
part
of
the
day
with
heart
full
of
vengeance
amongst
the
little
knots
of
people
loitering
outside
the
gate
and
had
only
been
induced
to
leave
the
spot
to
go
and
claim
the
poultry
waiting
for
him
at
the
station
just
as
the
veil
caught
in
the
wicker
he
moved
a
little
to
one
side
to
escape
a
group
of
laughing
joyous
pilgrims
swung
right
round
to
shout
them
a
greeting
and
in
so
doing
pulled
the
struggling
woman
in
front
of
him
tearing
off
her
veil
and
exposing
the
right
side
of
her
face
which
having
escaped
injury
was
still
wonderfully
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
dirt
the
basket
of
hens
crashed
to
the
ground
and
bursting
liberated
the
birds
as
with
a
yell
of
zulannah
the
man
leapt
straight
at
the
woman
who
dived
under
a
porter
arm
and
disappeared
through
the
exit
there
was
a
sudden
mad
rush
to
the
exit
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
bazaar
who
jamming
together
in
a
shouting
yelling
pack
gave
the
woman
a
few
moments
grace
stand
on
one
side
sir
come
back
miss
ordered
the
seizing
the
arm
of
an
indignant
britisher
it
no
use
trying
to
stop
them
they
go
like
this
sometimes
quite
mad
generally
when
sighted
a
thief
or
somebody
against
whom
they
have
some
grudge
let
them
pass
sir
let
them
pass
the
was
packed
with
vehicles
motors
omnibuses
and
scores
of
rattling
racketing
native
carts
straight
into
the
middle
of
them
fled
the
woman
terror
lending
her
an
incredible
speed
which
agonising
physical
pain
augmented
she
dived
under
horses
she
squeezed
through
vehicles
she
twisted
and
turned
caring
naught
for
the
native
drivers
who
indifferent
to
the
daily
sufferings
of
their
wretched
little
horses
lashed
at
her
with
their
whips
with
shouts
of
and
peals
of
derisive
laughter
headed
by
the
man
who
had
carried
the
hens
their
eyes
blazing
helpless
victims
of
the
indescribable
which
sometimes
seizes
the
mob
the
inhabitants
of
the
bazaar
with
those
who
understanding
nothing
of
the
cause
of
the
tumult
had
joined
in
merely
for
the
sport
were
after
the
woman
like
a
pack
of
hounds
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
limp
caused
by
the
shortening
of
one
leg
and
which
became
more
noticeable
the
more
she
ran
she
might
have
escaped
in
the
crowd
in
the
place
rameses
and
been
alive
but
the
pack
as
they
ran
shouted
a
lame
dog
a
lame
dog
who
has
seen
a
lame
dog
and
those
who
had
rushed
to
door
or
window
to
watch
the
fun
pointed
her
out
with
yells
of
laughter
she
found
a
few
respite
when
she
tripped
and
fell
over
the
neck
of
a
recumbent
camel
indistinguishable
in
the
gloom
of
the
side
street
into
which
she
had
turned
as
she
headed
for
her
own
house
she
had
no
distinct
plan
in
her
head
she
was
too
exhausted
to
think
she
only
knew
as
know
all
wounded
animals
that
home
is
the
place
to
get
to
when
stricken
unto
death
if
she
had
just
sat
quite
still
on
the
kerb
pulled
a
bit
of
stuff
across
her
face
and
pointed
way
down
the
street
with
peals
of
laughter
the
mob
would
have
swept
past
her
and
she
would
have
been
safe
but
she
blindly
ran
for
home
if
she
had
stayed
where
she
had
fallen
behind
the
camel
which
lurched
to
its
feet
as
the
pack
ran
by
she
would
even
then
have
been
safe
but
she
lay
face
down
in
the
filth
only
long
enough
to
regain
her
breath
which
sounded
like
a
whistle
as
it
shrilled
through
the
twisted
mouth
with
breath
regained
she
was
up
and
away
with
the
secret
door
in
the
wall
which
had
been
discovered
in
her
absence
as
her
goal
just
as
the
human
hounds
doubling
on
their
tracks
tore
into
the
street
to
see
the
fluttering
end
of
her
dress
disappear
round
a
corner
she
ran
with
a
twisting
shuffling
lope
horrible
to
see
she
looked
like
some
wounded
animal
as
bent
double
she
paused
again
for
breath
just
for
one
moment
with
face
to
the
wall
she
ran
on
she
stumbled
and
regained
her
footing
she
fell
on
her
crippled
knees
then
onto
her
face
in
the
dust
where
she
remained
breathing
like
a
horse
with
bloodstained
foam
flecking
the
corners
of
her
mouth
a
great
shivering
shook
her
as
she
listened
to
the
shouting
yelling
mob
questing
this
way
and
that
for
the
lost
quarry
she
did
not
pray
poor
zulannah
she
knew
nothing
of
a
god
of
love
or
pity
to
pray
to
she
lay
still
burying
her
fingers
in
the
sand
clinging
desperately
to
what
remained
to
her
of
life
they
swept
round
the
corner
those
men
and
women
screaming
vengeance
on
her
who
lived
in
luxury
whilst
they
starved
who
hung
herself
with
jewels
and
neglected
to
pay
the
trifling
debts
of
the
bazaar
who
lived
in
a
house
built
on
the
site
of
their
demolished
homes
they
rushed
past
and
over
her
lying
begrimed
and
foul
one
with
the
dust
of
the
street
they
drove
her
face
into
the
dust
they
marked
her
beautiful
body
with
the
shape
of
their
feet
but
they
did
not
kill
her
she
wanted
to
live
the
pack
passed
on
to
the
bazaar
carrying
with
it
the
definite
news
of
the
return
of
the
woman
zulannah
and
if
you
had
looked
close
you
would
have
seen
the
cunning
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
carried
the
hens
if
you
had
listened
to
his
whispered
words
you
would
have
shivered
at
the
ferocity
of
his
counsel
in
the
passing
of
ten
minutes
you
would
if
you
had
walked
that
way
have
walked
through
empty
streets
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
or
nobody
to
whisper
to
you
of
the
men
women
children
and
dogs
standing
packed
in
the
rooms
and
passages
and
courtyards
waiting
for
a
given
signal
the
moon
looked
down
on
a
peaceful
scene
as
zulannah
wrapped
in
filthy
garments
crept
stealthily
from
shadow
to
shadow
had
she
been
more
observant
she
would
have
wondered
at
the
intense
stillness
of
the
bazaar
which
no
matter
at
what
hour
of
the
night
is
full
of
little
sounds
the
song
of
a
woman
or
her
laugh
or
her
cry
the
crack
of
a
whip
the
baying
of
dogs
if
she
had
looked
back
she
would
have
seen
the
stealthy
opening
of
doors
the
craning
of
a
furtive
head
as
quickly
withdrawn
she
paid
no
heed
she
was
so
near
so
very
near
the
place
in
the
wall
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
palms
and
in
which
was
the
secret
door
which
opened
on
the
pressing
of
a
certain
brick
in
the
third
row
from
the
top
and
once
in
the
house
with
a
veil
across
her
face
a
whip
or
dagger
in
her
hand
she
would
show
them
who
was
master
cripple
or
no
cripple
fool
that
she
had
been
to
have
submitted
to
the
black
qatim
but
thrice
fool
he
who
knew
nothing
of
that
other
bank
in
which
her
fortune
and
her
jewels
were
kept
in
safe
custody
against
such
a
rainy
day
as
this
she
cursed
herself
for
the
blundering
feeble
way
she
had
set
about
revenge
she
cursed
the
moon
the
agony
of
her
limbs
the
stretch
which
lay
between
one
shadow
and
another
but
she
laughed
though
no
sound
issued
from
the
gaping
mouth
as
she
stood
in
the
last
patch
of
shadow
which
was
separated
by
some
few
yards
of
silvery
path
from
the
black
blot
upon
the
wall
which
covered
the
secret
door
they
had
hunted
and
harried
her
and
walked
upon
her
body
lying
in
the
dust
but
they
had
lost
her
and
had
gone
back
to
their
hovels
to
eat
and
sleep
and
maybe
once
more
cast
up
the
reckoning
of
the
money
she
owed
them
the
which
she
swore
the
most
horrible
oath
she
would
never
pay
she
gathered
up
her
garments
and
stole
swiftly
across
the
moonlit
space
she
had
just
touched
the
edge
of
the
shadow
she
was
almost
home
when
with
a
mighty
shout
they
were
upon
her
out
of
the
houses
out
of
the
courtyards
down
the
streets
they
swarmed
children
and
women
falling
to
be
jerked
to
their
feet
by
the
men
who
ran
silently
urged
on
by
the
fanatic
who
for
years
had
hugged
the
idea
of
some
such
moment
of
most
horrible
revenge
and
then
to
the
sinister
sound
of
the
rushing
feet
there
was
added
the
baying
of
many
pariah
dogs
which
from
every
conceivable
corner
and
from
miles
away
raced
like
a
pack
of
wolves
upon
the
steppes
to
join
the
hunt
blind
with
terror
shaking
in
agony
zulannah
fumbled
helplessly
for
the
special
brick
it
lay
she
knew
in
the
third
row
and
had
as
mark
a
jutting
piece
of
mortar
in
the
middle
she
passed
her
hand
wildly
up
and
down
too
mad
with
fear
to
count
every
brick
to
right
to
left
and
as
far
as
she
could
reach
above
below
had
the
jutting
piece
of
mortar
the
wall
was
as
high
as
the
heavens
the
third
row
was
here
beneath
her
hand
no
high
above
her
head
no
one
two
yes
here
her
fingers
touched
it
it
was
gone
it
takes
a
long
time
to
write
or
read
in
inky
words
but
it
was
really
only
a
few
seconds
before
the
door
swung
open
she
gave
a
scream
of
terrible
relief
and
rushed
into
the
blackness
and
as
she
rushed
a
dog
leapt
straight
at
her
shoulders
she
screamed
again
and
the
door
with
all
her
strength
it
shut
upon
the
dog
breaking
its
back
it
remained
ajar
to
her
pursuers
there
still
was
hope
she
knew
the
way
they
did
not
could
she
but
get
to
her
bedroom
behind
the
massive
doors
could
she
but
reach
the
telephone
the
instrument
she
had
regarded
as
her
finest
toy
she
would
soon
have
the
police
running
to
the
rescue
she
fled
down
the
narrow
passage
which
led
to
a
jumble
of
small
rooms
she
even
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
cursing
of
those
who
ran
behind
her
stumbling
in
the
narrow
way
she
fled
through
the
farthest
door
she
was
free
there
but
remained
the
shallow
flight
of
marble
stairs
to
the
suite
wherein
her
bedroom
lay
then
she
stopped
and
shrieking
flung
out
her
arms
to
right
to
left
and
upon
the
flight
of
stairs
there
stood
her
servants
the
men
and
the
women
she
had
flogged
and
kicked
thinking
to
heal
their
wounds
and
bruises
and
dim
their
memories
by
throwing
gold
amongst
them
on
the
morrow
they
made
no
movement
they
simply
stood
and
stared
her
and
mantle
had
gone
her
were
torn
to
shreds
leaving
exposed
the
slender
body
which
leaned
sideways
like
a
tree
which
had
been
struck
by
lightning
her
matted
hair
fell
far
below
her
waist
it
made
a
frame
to
the
horrible
face
one
side
of
which
was
as
that
of
an
old
old
hag
and
the
other
grimed
with
dirt
flecked
with
foam
was
yet
as
lovely
as
a
jewel
they
shrank
back
and
still
further
back
they
made
the
sign
to
scare
away
the
spirit
of
evil
thinking
her
possessed
of
eblis
the
devil
they
would
not
have
touched
her
for
a
gold
piece
they
turned
their
heads
at
the
sound
of
rushing
footsteps
they
motioned
her
to
move
on
believing
her
mad
they
gave
her
a
chance
for
in
the
east
you
dare
not
turn
your
hand
against
the
mentally
afflicted
she
ran
and
after
her
came
the
pack
in
full
cry
across
great
rooms
lit
by
hanging
lamps
scented
with
brasiers
of
perfumed
wood
she
fled
slipping
upon
chinchilla
rug
or
glaring
monstrous
hearthrug
of
berlin
wool
in
her
desperate
haste
to
quit
the
house
out
into
the
air
she
must
get
under
the
trees
in
the
garden
under
the
moon
down
the
broad
paths
to
the
wall
at
the
end
there
was
no
wall
too
high
for
her
to
climb
in
her
extremity
her
face

grey
her
eyes
sunk
in
black
orbits
her
nose
pinched
with
nostrils
which
blew
and
flattened
like
bellows
to
her

breathing

clutched
at
her
streaming

it

hurtled
through

was
she
dead

she
crashed
down
into
the

at
the

in

they

stripped
bare
just
before

shot
skywards

of
the

had

to
go
to
the
ball
in
fact
since
her
storm
of
tears
on
her
return
from
the
unlucky
visit
to
denderah
she
had
taken
the
broad
view
of
the
situation
and
had
decided
to
give
her
neighbours
no
cause
for
comment
and
to
continue
the
festive
life
as
led
in
the
winter
season
on

until
the
return
of
her
godmother
after
which
she
would
as
soon
as

shake
the

of
the

of

from
off

so
gay

she
so
full

i
told
you
so
mamma
had
said
ellen
this
night
of
the
full
moon
as
she
had
pondered
before
the
mirror
upon
the
effect
a
in
the
shape
of
a
royal
asp
would
have
upon
a
certain
retired
colonel
who
seemed
inclined
to
find
solace
for
his
long
widowhood
secondes
she
evidently
did
not
see
kelham
and
sybil
on
the
and
i
honestly
do
not
think
she
cares
for
him
a
bit
no
broke
in
berenice
whose
hair
clung
to
her
head
like
wet
seaweed
to
a
rock
i
am
sure
she
does
not
do
you
think
if
ambrose
had
had
courted
me
and
then
neglected
me
that
i
could
have
danced
and
laughed
and
well
i
thankful
broke
in
mamma
looking
after
any
girl
as
beautiful
and
erratic
supplied
ellen
who
had
decided
on
the
erratic
as
damaris
is
certainly
no
sinecure
supplied
berenice
who
in
the
fervour
of
her
affection
for
her
herculean
cleric
gave
no
thought
to
such
trifles
as
and
not
much
to
the
rest
of
her
attire
giving
a
final
pat
to
her
offsprings
toilettes
mamma
shepherded
them
downstairs
tapping
at
damaris
door
as
she
passed
inviting
her
to
join
them
in
the
where
they
were
going
to
sit
and
look
at
the
dresses
and
watch
the
arrival
of
the
guests
from
the
less
select
hotels
damaris
looked
radiantly
beautiful
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
window
of
her
godmother
into
which
she
had
gone
to
fetch
a
fan
true
her
eyes
looked
in
the
violet
shadows
that
surrounded
them
and
her
cheek
and
were
unduly
prominent
but
then
however
well
you
hide
the
fox
of
uncertainty
which
tears
at
the
vitals
of
your
common
sense
and
sense
of
humour
you
can
not
completely
hide
the
outward
signs
of
the
inner
agony
which
tortures
you
you
a
perfect
picture
dearie
said
jane
coop
as
she
tied
the
ribbons
of
the
simple
heelless
white
leather
shoes
in
which
the
girl
always
preferred
to
dance
let
me
look
at
you
just
once
more
like
a
slender
lily
damaris
stood
under
the
electric
light
the
soft
white
satin
seemed
to
cling
like
a
sheath
to
the
slender
beautiful
figure
her
arms
were
bare
the
bodice
cut
low
enough
to
show
her
gleaming
shoulders
she
was
dazzling
virginal
remote
as
she
stood
quite
still
looking
down
at
her
maid
her
eyes
looked
intensely
black
her
red
hair
flamed
she
wore
no
jewels
save
for
a
massive
jewelled
brooch
in
the
shape
of
a
hawk
which
glittered
in
the
bodice
just
above
the
where
thinking
the
bodice
too
low
she
had
pinned
it
hastily
i
do
like
that
brooch
dearie
said
the
maid
it
a
waste
of
money
i
think
to
buy
these
heathen
things
but
there
you
and
her
grace
know
best
and
do
forget
your
cloak
darling
it
too
chilly
to
sit
out
in
the
grounds
without
one
egypt
or
no
egypt
i
be
real
glad
when
we
run
into
waterloo
station
that
i
shall
damaris
laughed
as
she
took
the
satin
cloak
with
broad
sable
collar
then
kissed
her
nannie
and
walked
down
the
corridor
to
her
followed
by
the
bulldog
i
do
want
to
dance
i
much
rather
stay
up
here
with
you
and
read
humff
said
the
dog
as
he
followed
his
beloved
onto
the
small
balcony
where
he
stood
as
close
as
he
could
to
her
as
she
leant
on
the
rail
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
and
out
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
ruined
temple
and
ruined
tomb
shone
white
i
come
up
and
see
you
both
she
said
looking
down
into
the
face
with
its
honest
eyes
and
beaming
expression
but
i
ca
take
you
down
with
me
you
know
you
might
hurl
yourself
into
the
middle
of
a
to
find
me
i
bring
you
up
a
cake
or
a
chocolate
if
you
stay
in
here
and
not
go
after
jane
to
worry
her
with
my
good
boy
stay
here
and
wait
for
missie
take
me
with
you
said
wellington
as
plainly
as
he
could
with
eyes
and
tail
take
me
with
you
ca
old
boy
look
she
reached
inside
for
a
book
she
had
been
reading
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
keep
that
for
missie
until
she
comes
back
she
smiled
down
at
the
great
brute
as
it
placed
both
forefeet
upon
the
volume
but
she
sighed
as
she
leant
for
a
moment
on
the
rail
then
suddenly
drew
back
as
she
heard
her
name
mentioned
by
someone
who
hankering
after
a
cigarette
had
wandered
out
to
the
canvas
rocking
seat
directly
beneath
the
balcony
well
said
the
masculine
voice
i
think
it
damned
hard
lines
on
miss
hethencourt
that
all
and
a
man
wants
a
damned
good
hiding
for
being
a
knave
as
well
as
a
fool
of
course
it
not
replied
the
voice
of
the
who
on
account
of
her
abnormal
interest
in
other
people
affairs
had
earned
the
sobriquet
of
paulina
pry
but
some
people
i
know
who
were
at
heliopolis
and
have
just
come
from
assouan
told
me
that
kelham
is
engaged
to
miss
sidmouth
you
know
she
is
the
crack
and
that
they
are
on
their
way
home
now
the
engagement
i
should
think
will
be
announced
shortly
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
infernally
sorry
that
miss
hethencourt
has
been
made
the
butt
of
gossip
and
scandal
through
a
cad
behaviour
and
i
think
that
you
and
i
ought
to
be
shot
for
discussing
her
and
her
very
intimate
affairs
if
damaris
waited
to
hear
no
more
white
as
chalk
she
stumbled
back
into
the
room
and
crouched
down
upon
the
floor
beside
a
chair
burying
her
face
in
her
arms
for
five
of
the
longest
minutes
of
her
life
she
knelt
burning
with
shame
trembling
with
rage
then
she
sat
hack
on
her
heels
is
there
nobody
to
help
me
in
all
the
wide
world
nobody
i
can
go
to
and
clearly
as
though
it
was
in
the
room
she
heard
the
echo
of
the
words
spoken
in
the
shrine
of
anubis
the
god
of
death
allah
how
i
love
you
and
if
i
may
not
be
your
master
i
can
at
least
serve
you
if
you
are
in
distress
will
you
send
me
a
messenger
to
my
tents
of
purple
and
gold
my
boat
from
sunset
to
sunrise
waits
at
the
the
mare
waits
from
the
setting
until
the
rising
of
the
sun
at
the
gate
of
she
acted
on
the
impulse
of
her
outraged
pride
she
gave
not
one
thought
to
the
mad
thing
she
was
about
to
do
she
stayed
not
one
instant
to
question
the
trustworthiness
of
the
man
who
had
so
strangely
shadowed
her
since
their
meeting
in
the
bazaar
she
decided
in
the
flick
of
an
eyelid
she
would
go
to
him
she
would
tell
him
everything
and
if
he
were
then
willing
to
make
her
his
wife
she
would
go
to
his
english
mother
and
from
the
shelter
of
her
arms
proclaim
her
engagement
to
the
world
yes
she
would
run
away
in
a
flash
she
thought
of
her
beloved
old
godmother
and
the
loving
arms
always
held
out
to
her
and
the
loving
sympathy
and
counsel
which
never
failed
but
she
shook
her
head
to
silence
the
scandalmongers
her
engagement
must
be
made
known
before
that
of
the
man
who
had
treated
her
so
shamefully
who
if
only
she
had
known
was
racing
towards
her
at
that
very
moment
as
fast
as
train
could
take
him
wait
for
missie
you
shall
come
to
her
she
whispered
as
she
knelt
and
kissed
the
dog
you
and
janie
she
sprang
to
her
feet
what
about
her
promise
to
her
old
nannie
had
she
not
crossed
her
heart
and
given
her
word
that
she
would
always
let
her
know
where
she
had
gone
she
moved
swiftly
to
the
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
hastily
wrote
a
line
then
looked
round
for
some
place
to
leave
the
message
wellington
whimpered
as
he
stood
with
his
on
the
book
she
ran
to
him
and
twisted
the
folded
paper
into
the
steel
ring
of
his
collar
hugged
him
closely
and
turned
away
with
a
lace
veil
over
her
head
concealing
her
face
with
the
cloak
wrapped
close
about
her
she
slipped
from
the
hotel
without
being
recognised
and
down
to
the
quay
almost
uncanny
is
the
intuitive
power
of
the
native
without
hesitation
a
boatman
stepped
forward
and
salaamed
to
the
ground
before
her
by
the
sign
of
the
harakat
he
repeated
the
phrase
his
master
had
taught
him
and
which
he
had
repeated
over
and
over
again
for
many
days
and
damaris
never
once
looked
back
as
the
boat
crossed
the
nile
which
for
all
she
knew
would
stretch
forever
an
impassable
barrier
between
herself
and
those
she
loved
acting
as
in
a
dream
she
could
never
clearly
recall
what
happened
until
she
stood
at
the
gate
of
she
had
a
vague
recollection
of
crossing
the
great
river
and
of
being
helped
out
of
the
boat
and
of
four
gigantic
nubians
who
stood
near
a
litter
and
salaamed
as
she
approached
she
remembered
too
that
the
litter
was
lined
and
hung
with
satin
curtains
and
piled
with
satin
cushions
and
that
she
had
been
carried
some
distance
at
a
gentle
trot
which
had
in
no
wise
disturbed
her
then
it
had
been
gently
placed
upon
the
ground
and
she
had
been
handed
out
to
find
the
of
the
stallion
sooltan
standing
salaaming
before
her
with
his
hand
on
the
bridle
of
the
mare
the
glory
of
egypt
chapter

made
the
pillars

the
bottom
thereof

of
purple
the
midst
thereof
being
paved
with
love
song
of
solomon
accustomed
to
the
flowing
robes
of
the
arab
it
is
not
as
difficult
as
it
might
be
imagined
to
break
a
horse
to
but
the
mare
spoilt
and
sensitive
behaved
like
a
very
demon
whilst
the
exchanged
the
which
is
the
native
pad
without
stirrups
for
the
lady
saddle
she
was
not
really
bad
not
she
she
was
simply
a
spoilt
beauty
and
inclined
to
show
off
so
that
every
time
her
big
beautiful
eye
caught
the
sheen
of
the
girl
satin
cloak
she
backed
and
reared
and
plunged
but
more
out
of
mischief
than
wickedness
for
many
days
she
had
been
ridden
alternately
astride
and
side
by
the
who
loved
her
better
than
his
wife
and
almost
as
much
as
his
son
ridden
from
the
tents
of
purple
and
gold
and
not
did
she
go
to
the
gate
of
at
sunset
to
be
taken
back
at
a
tearing
gallop
to
the
tents
without
restraining
or
guiding
hand
upon
the
reins
at
sunrise
it
was
not
sunrise
now
and
she
did
not
like
the
person
in
the
shimmering
satin
who
had
in
some
miraculous
way
swung
to
her
back
and
stayed
there
but
she
was
headed
in
the
direction
of
home
and
the
moonlight
was
having
just
as
much
effect
upon
her
temperament
as
it
has
on
that
of
humans
a
horse
or
a
camel
in
the
desert
is
a
weird
picture
and
it
were
wise
as
they
are
for
the
moment
absolutely
fey
to
give
them
an
extremely
wide
passage
guide
her
not
lady
shouted
the
to
damaris
who
answered
to
the
movement
of
the
mare
like
a
reed
in
the
wind
but
otherwise
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
horse
or
man
or
moon
or
untoward
circumstance
he
hung
on
for
a
moment
to
the
silken
mane
and
stared
up
into
the
girl
unseeing
eyes
then
with
a
ringing
shout
let
go
and
jumped
nimbly
to
one
side
there
was
no
backing
no
rearing
or
vagary
of
any
sort
now
the
mare
started
on
her
journey
broke
into
a
canter
broke
into
a
gallop
then
silken
mane
and
tail
flying
thundered
back
at
a
terrific
speed
along
the
path
marked
out
by
her
own
dainty
hoofs
and
the
relentless
feet
of
that
hound

damaris
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
behind
and
then
to
her
right
and
then
to
her
left
she
was
alone
in
the
desert
the
sands
stretched
like
a
silver
carpet
in
front
of
her
and
like
a
silver
carpet
with
the
black
ribbon
woven
across
it
by
the
mare
feet
behind
to
the
east
and
west
the
sandy
waste
seemed
to
undulate
in
great
fawn
and
amethyst
and
waves
so
tremendous
was
the
beast
pace
the
horizon
looked
as
though
draped
in
curtains
and
opalescent
the
heavens
stretched
silvery
and
cold
as
merciless
as
a
woman
who
has
ceased
to
love
and
then
just
as
on
the
far
horizon
there
showed
a
mound
which
might
have
been
a
hillock
of
sand
or
a
verdant
patch
outcome
of
precious
water
or
a
caravan
of
camel
the
mare
increased
her
pace
you
would
not
have
noticed
it
for
it
would
have
seemed
to
you
that
she
was
already
all
out
but
you
would
as
did
damaris
if
you
knew
anything
about
horses
have
it
had
you
been
riding
her
it
was
that
last
grain
of
the
last
ounce
by
which
races
are
won
the
supreme
effort
of
the
great
sporting
instinct
which
lies
in
all
thoroughbreds
human
or
animal
and
damaris
thrilled
to
the
innermost
part
of
her
being
as
she
sensed
rather
than
felt
the
quiver
which
passed
through
the
mare
leant
forward
and
touched
the
satin
neck
that
which
distance
had
given
the
appearance
of
a
mound
grew
more
and
more
distinct
it
was
no
mound
nor
hillock
verdant
patch
nor
caravan
of
camel
three
tents
showed
at
last
distinctly
and
the
following
is
the
short
explanation
of
their
origin
as
it
is
not
good
for
the
oriental
youth
to
stay
under
the
same
roof
as
his
mother
once
he
has
come
to
man
estate
which
is
at
any
age
after
eleven
in
the
lands
of
intense
sun
the
building
of
the
house
mahabbha
near
the
oasis
of
khargegh
had
been
begun
within
the
first
year
of
the
birth
of
hugh
carden
ali
owing
to
the
entreaties
of
his
english
mother
the
boy
had
not
been
affianced
in
extreme
youth
to
a
little
maid
of
two
or
three
or
four
summers
upon
whom
he
would
not
have
set
eyes
until
the
night
of
the
marriage
his
mother
had
idolised
him
and
he
had
worshipped
her
he
obeyed
her
he
would
willingly
have
died
for
her
later
at
her
request
he
even
left
his
country
of
sunshine
and
vivid
colouring
for
hers
so
cold
and
bleak
but
before
that
and
at
the
age
when
other
youths
of
arabia
settle
down
in
their
own
house
to
contemplate
seriously
the
taking
of
the
reins
into
their
own
despotic
hands
he
had
absolutely
refused
to
go
to
the
house
mahabbha
built
for
him
as
his
perhaps
also
it
was
the
english
blood
in
his
veins
which
at
that
age
filled
him
with
the
spirit
of
adventure
a
desire
for
solitude
a
desire
for
something
sterner
than
the
everyday
existence
of
his
luxurious
life
had
driven
him
out
into
the
desert
where
bewitched
as
it
were
of
woman
he
had
followed
the
spirit
which
ever
held
out
her
long
fine
hand
with
beckoning
finger
a
mere
boy
absurd
ridiculous
not
at
all
for
the
boy
of
twelve
in
the
orient
is
as
much
developed
physically
and
mentally
as
the
occidental
of
over
twenty
he
had
followed
the
spirit
where
she
had
beckoned
and
an
arab
through
the
blood
of
his
father
had
caught
her
and
crushed
the
body
slender
to
gauntness
in
his
arms
had
twined
his
fingers
in
the
coarse
black
hair
and
pulled
it
back
from
the
eyes
had
sought
the
crimson
mouth
until
his
lips
had
rasped
with
the
kisses
with
sand
slept
with
his
hands
clutching
her
tattered
robes
of
saffron
purple
and
of
gold
torn
the
misty
veil
from
before
her
face
and
dreamed
with
her
cool
breath
which
is
the
wind
of
dawn
upon
his
face
he
loved
her
and
to
her
had
pitched
his
tents
he
prayed
that
he
might
be
with
her
when
he
died
and
convinced
that
his
prayer
would
be
answered
he
had
pitched
him
a
funeral
tent
between
those
of
purple
and
of
gold
bewitched
of
the
desert
the
colour
of
the
tents
resembled
those
in
which
she
decks
herself
in
the
passing
of
a
day
and
a
night
outwardly
they
were
just
ordinary
bedouin
tents
the
tan
and
brown
of
and
square
giving
a
man
room
in
which
to
move
and
stand
to
his
full
stature
without
the
fear
as
in
the
peaked
affair
called
bell
of
bringing
the
whole
thing
down
upon
his
crown
they
lifted
at
each
side
to
allow
the
desert
wind
to
enter
at
any
hour
it
listed
or
the
moon
to
pierce
him
with
silvery
spear
or
the
stars
to
blaze
like
jewels
before
his
eyes
as
he
waited
for
sleep
on
a
rug
upon
the
sand
the
one
in
which
he
slept
was
hung
inside
with
satin
curtains
of
deepest
purple
with
here
and
there
a
star
of
silver
which
glittered
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
hung
from
the
the
persian
rug
upon
the
floor
was
grey
and
old
rose
and
faintest
yellow
and
glistened
like
the
skin
of
woman
of
the
ordinary
furnishings
of
an
ordinary
bedroom
there
was
no
sign
you
would
have
to
go
much
farther
afield
to
find
the
tent
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
the
toilet
just
as
you
would
have
to
go
still
farther
and
towards
the
west
to
where
were
pitched
the
stables
and
the
quarters
of
the
servants
he
took
with
him
in
his
desert
wanderings
just
enough
and
they
had
their
work
cut
out
to
look
after
the
dogs
and
birds
and
horses
the
camels
upon
whom
depended
the
supplies
were
right
out
of
sight
and
any
one
of
the
servants
would
have
preferred
death
by
torture
to
approaching
within
a
mile
of
his
tents
until
he
heard
his
call
in
the
other
tent
he
ate
his
bread
and
dates
and
drank
his
coffee
or
received
the
humblest
of
his
passing
brothers
those
who
scorched
with
heat
tortured
with
thirst
or
hunger
and
blinded
with
flying
sand
yet
would
not
exchange
one
minute
of
their
own
free
desert
life
for
an
eternity
of
soft
couches
and
the
most
succulent
effort
of
a
in
the
cramped
surroundings
of
a
crowded
city
it
was
hung
with
orange
satin
cushions
of
every
hue
were
flung
upon
a
carpet
of
violent
colours
the
lamps
of
bronze
with
wicks
floating
in
crimson
saucers
hanging
from
the
crosspole
were
rarely
lit
the
satin
curtains
hid
a
smaller
room
behind
filled
with
dates
and
sweetmeats
beads
and
other
things
which
bring
joy
to
the
grateful
heart
of
the
wandering
arab
and
his
family
the
sand
outside
was
marked
and
pressed
down
with
footprints
of
men
and
women
and
little
children
they
had
not
to
ask
in
order
to
receive
but
no
foot
but
his
had
ever
trod
the
fine
matting
of
the
tent
between
the
other
two
firmly
convinced
that
his
prayer
would
be
granted
and
that
in
the
desert
he
would
find
the
answer
to
the
many
questions
which
had
occurred
to
him
to
ask
of
life
he
had
sought
for
a
covering
under
which
he
could
lie
after
death
until
naught
but
his
bones
should
be
left
for
the
wind
of
chance
to
play
with
he
had
all
a
mohammedan
belief
in
the
hand
of
destiny
but
the
english
blood
in
his
veins
filled
him
with
horror
at
the
thought
of
being
torn
to
pieces
by
vultures
after
death
his
desert
blood
filled
him
with
an
equal
horror
at
the
thought
of
being
weighted
down
by
the
regulation
tomb
of
bricks
and
mortar
and
so
it
came
to
pass
on
this
night
of
the
full
moon
when
the
girl
he
loved
was
racing
towards
him
and
fate
was
disentangling
the
threads
she
had
knotted
so
grievously
that
he
lay
stretched
upon
the
block
of
wood
which
stood
three
feet
high
in
the
centre
of
this
tent
he
lay
face
downwards
with
chin
in
hand
looking
out
through
the
lifted
flap
in
the
direction
of
mecca
whilst
the
moon
hung
as
a
silver
shield
above
him
and
the
desert
enfolded
him
on
every
side
outwardly
the
tent
was
as
that
of
any
bedouin
tan
and
brown
the
colour
of
the
camel
hide
of
which
it
was
made
with
one
side
only
which
lifted
the
side
which
was
towards
mecca
inside
it
was
lined
with
a
copy
of
the
queen
funeral
canopy
of
softest
leather
stretched
square
to
the
touch
as
soft
supple
and
fine
as
velvet
true
this
copy
had
not
taken
year
upon
year
to
make
nor
had
scores
and
scores
of
nimble
fingers
stitched
and
stitched
for
days
and
months
to
finish
it
as
in
the
days
of
the
xixth
dynasty
the
panels
in
the
copy
were
of
one
piece
of
hide
stitched
finely
by
machinery
with
the
emblems
painted
upon
them
after
the
stitching
in
the
original
they
are
made
by
the
stitching
together
by
hand
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
pieces
of
each
of
which
had
been
painted
either
pink
or
blue
or
green
or
in
various
shades
of
yellow
before
the
stitching
look
up
with
hugh
carden

as
he
lifts
his
head
to
gaze
at
something
far
beyond
the
you
will
see
a
copy
of
the
central
square
which
divided
into
two
rested
upon
the
top
of
the
shrine
which
covered
the
dead
queen
who
died
about
one
hundred
years
after
the
siege
of
troy
one
side
of
the
panel
is
sprinkled
with
yellow
and
pink
rosettes
on
a
ground
the
other
side
shows
the

emblem
of
maternity
holding
in
its
claws

a
copy
of
the
flaps
which
hung
down
on
each
side
of
the
shrine
of
the
of
the
egyptian
queen
who
some
thousand
years
before
christ
crossed
the

followed
by
other
boats
filled
with
her
priests

princes
her
officers
her
mourning
women
north
and
south
the
flaps
are
of
pattern
in
squares
of
pink
and
green
behind
one
of
which
was
hidden
the
small
room
which
held
naught
but
a
crystal
pitcher
and
crystal
basin
filled
to
the
brim
with
water
for
the
ablutions
at
the
hour
of

the
hour
of
prayer
near
the

the
sides
show
bands
of
colour
red
yellow
green
and
blue
almost
as
bright
in
the
original
as
on
the
day

paints
were
mixed
one
thousand
years
ago
beneath
the
bands
upon

will
see
the
which
opens
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
closes
at
its
setting
the
enigmatic
ducklings
and
the
picture
of
a
gazelle
which
is
doubtless
the
representation
of
the
pet
which
bound
in
mummy
trappings
was
found
beside
its
royal
mistress

technical

down

like

of

a
great
light
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
rose
from
the
couch
of
wood
upon
which
his
dead
body
with
feet
turned
towards
mecca
was
to
lie
the
light
from
the
lamp
of
bronze
and
shade
of
deepest
orange
tint
struck
down
upon
him
throwing
shadows
from
the
turban
which
outlined
the
fine
face
to
beneath
the
eyes

round
about
the
and
the
mouth
of
which
the
gentleness
was
so
belied

the
dominant
jaw

gave
an
ivory
shade

of

glistened
on
his
only
jewel
an
amulet
carved
from
an
emerald
in
the
shape
of
a
scarab
set
in
gold
and
hung
from
a
fine
gold
chain
about
his
neck
his
beauty
was
of
the
east
but
it
was
male
there
was
no
trace
of
that
effeminacy
which
so
jars
upon
the
sensibilities
of
those
who
are
bred
in
colder
climes
and
brought
up
on
sterner
lines
than
the
luxurious
dweller
of
the
east
he
stood
listening
to
the
sound
then
threw
out
his
arms
by
the
mercy
of
allah
god
of
gods
i
am
found
worthy
to
serve
thee
o
my
beloved
within

over

passing
of
half
one
hour
before
the

he
knew
his
heart
told
him
who
was
coming
to
him
out
of
the
night
his
knowledge
of
the
desert
enabled
him
by
the
drumming
sound
of
the
hoofs
upon
the
sand
a
sound
which
has
not
its
semblance
in
the
world
to
know
to
a
second
when
the
mare
would
stop
before
the
tent
it
was
not
the
hour
of
nazam
the
hour
of
prayer
before
dawn
the
dawn
which
was
to
see
his
questions
answered
but
he
turned
and
pulling
back
the
leather
curtain
entered
the
small
room
lighted
by
a
silver
lamp
hanging
just
above
the
crystal
basin
full
to
the
brim
with
water
no
it
was
not
the
hour
of
nazam
but
filled
with
the
mysterious
premonition
of
that
which
is
to
befall
he
performed
the
prescribed
ablutions
of
the
hour
of
prayer
three
times
he
washed
his
nostrils
his
mouth
and
hands
and
arms
to
the
elbow
the
right
first
as
ordained
then
the
head
and
neck
and
ears
once
and
feet
once
he
stood
erect
with
his
hands
above
his
head
for
five
full
minutes
whilst
the
drumming
of
the
sands
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
then
emptied
the
water
in
a
circle
upon
the
desert
sands
refilled
the
crystal
basin
with
water
from
a
crystal
pitcher
and
passed
into
the
tent
and
out
upon
the
sands
across
which
and
even
as
a
speck
upon
the
horizon
he
saw
the
mare
racing
and
he
threw
his
hands
heavenwards
with
a
great
cry
allah
be
praised
oh
allah
unto
thee
i
give
thanks
the
prayer
of
thanksgiving
uttered
by
his
own
father
so
many
years
ago
it
was
a
sight
to
watch
that
of
the
mare
stretched
out
flying
like
the
wind
ridden
by
a
slip
of
a
girl
with
her
gleaming
cloak
streaming
like
a
banner
behind
her
but
the
look
upon
the
face
was
still
more
wonderful
to
behold
as
he
stood
motionless
sharply
outlined
against
the
orange
light
behind
him
the
mare
slackened
not
her
pace
one
whit
like
a
thunderbolt
she
hurled
herself
right
up
to
where
stood
the
master
she
loved
with
all
her
great
equine
heart
then
she
stopped
short
fine
spread
wide
then
reared
until
it
seemed
she
must
fall
backwards
then
crashed
down
to
rear
again
until
the
loved
voice
bade
her
stand
with
the
strange
frozen
look
in
her
eyes
which
gave
them
the
appearance
of
lakes
and
which
had
been
there
since
she
had
crept
from
the
hotel
damaris
slipped
from
the
saddle
into
the
arms
of
hugh
carden
ali
and
there
she
rested
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
the
stress
of
her
ride
whilst
the
white
mare
whinnied
for
some
recognition
from
her
master
and
he
pulled
her
forelock
from
about
her
gentle
eyes
and
pulled
her
small
ears
and
stroked
the
arched
neck
then
with
a
sharp
word
ordered
her
to
her
stables
and
turning
to
lead
the
girl
into
the
tent
in
which
no
foot
but
his
had
trod
gave
no
more
thought
to
the
mare
she
obeyed
him
with
mighty
little
zest
yet
lingering
not
one
moment
even
though
her
delicate
nostrils
showed
wide
their
crimson
depths
and
her
satin
flanks
heaved
like
bellows
through
the
speed
in
which
she
had
covered
so
many
miles
she
moved
away
at
a
gentle
trot
then
stopped
and
looked
back
along
her
satin
flank
towards
the
tent
in
a
vain
hope
of
seeing
her
master
just
once
more
she
did
not
turn
completely
round
she
obeyed
where
she
loved
she
just
looked
back
along
her
flank
then
doubtless
recognising
her
defeat
gave
a
little
flick
of
her
heels
and
trotted
off
again
she
was
just
midway
between
the
tents
and
her
stables
when
she
stopped
dead
with
ears
pricked
forward
save
for
the
silvery
mane
and
tail
blown
by
the
she
might
have
been
a
statue
carved
out
of
marble
so
still
was
she
then
she
suddenly
backed
and
reared
a
foot
or
two
then
backed
again
wheeled
started
towards
the
tents
stopped
and
wheeled
again
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
the
beautiful
terrified
creature
great
eyes
rolling
little
feet
sending
the
sand
flying
as
she
moved
continually
on
one
spot
there
was
nothing
to
see
as
she
stood
looking
east
the
tents
were
behind
her
her
stables
in
a
straight
line
from
them
to
the
west
there
was
absolutely
no
sound
none
at
all
until
she
neighed
she
neighed
until
the
desert
rang
with
the
sound
neighed
until
the
horses
in
the
stables
some
miles
away
pulled
at
their
halters
and
lashed
out
on
every
side
then
she
reared
and
wheeled
as
she
stood
straight
on
her
slender
then
crashing
to
the
ground
with
a
convulsive
leap
was
off
into
the
desert
neither
did
she
return
for
many
days
nor
was
she
seen
until
that
dawn
when
her
found
her
in
front
of
the
middle
tent
snuffing
at
the
closed
flap
but
the
flap
was
not
closed
this
night
as
hugh
carden
ali
sat
on
the
couch
of
wood
and
looked
at
the
girl
who
sat
beside
him
she
stared
down
at
her
hands
which
pleated
and
flattened
and
the
satin
of
her
skirt
and
her
face
was
as
white
as
her
neck
and
her
arms
which
shone
like
lilies
kissed
by
the
sun
under
the
light
of
the
orange
lamp
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
for
it
was
not
for
him
to
guide
or
influence
her
in
any
way
by
spoken
word
he
led
her
to
the
wooden
couch
which
had
perforce
to
serve
as
seat
as
there
was
none
other
in
the
tent
and
took
her
cloak
passing
his
hand
gently
across
the
sable
collar
which
encircled
her
throat
and
he
glimpsed
the
hurt
of
her
heart
down
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
when
she
looked
up
at
him
and
put
out
her
hand
and
stopped
him
when
murmuring
something
about
coffee
he
turned
to
the
entrance
i
could
not
drink
it
thank
you
she
whispered
i
i
want
and
stopped
and
looked
down
and
pleated
the
satin
over
her
knee
and
flattened
it
with
her
palm
she
was
terrified
at
the
desperate
step
she
had
taken
and
well
she
might
be
she
was
strung
to
a
great
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
through
the
exhilaration
of
her
tearing
ride
she
was
stubbornly
determined
to
prevent
the
finger
of
scorn
from
pointing
in
her
direction
but
she
was
finding
a
subtle
salve
to
the
smart
of
the
wound
to
her
pride
in
the
romantic
setting
of
the
wonderful
picture
made
by
the
man
beside
her
in
faith
i
see
no
real
excuse
whatever
in
exoneration
of
her
mad
impulse
unless
it
be
in
her
education
or
rather
want
of
it
and
in
the
fact
that
she
was
younger
than
her
years
educated
in
the
way
in
which
are
educated
the
girls
who
will
not
have
to
use
their
knowledge
to
earn
a
livelihood
with
it
must
be
confessed
the
great
and
rare
in
these
days
asset
of
perfect
manners
and
courtesy
towards
all
mankind
yet
had
she
never
been
taught
the
rudiments
of
and
deliberation
she
had
a
heart
of
gold
truly
but
she
leapt
to
conclusions
with
closed
eyes
with
her
to
think
had
always
been
to
act
so
that
having
leapt
far
out
into
a
morass
of
incertitude
she
sat
perplexed
for
is
no
easy
matter
to
say
please
will
you
marry
me
to
a
man
even
if
you
know
that
he
worships
the
ground
your
shadow
falls
upon
he
sat
silent
with
his
eyes
upon
her
hands
waiting
for
fate
to
point
out
his
path
little
by
little
bit
by
bit
her
surroundings
began
to
affect
her
the
blood
came
slowly
back
to
her
cheeks
so
that
they
glowed
like
the
wild
rose
in
the
hedgerow
and
her
eyes
began
to
lose
that
set
stare
which
hides
the
perturbed
mind
and
to
soften
behind
the
heavy
fringe
of
lashes
and
her
hands
to
cease
their
nervous
plucking
at
her
dress
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
tent
side
looked
at
the
silvery
spear
and
tilted
her
head
back
until
her
throat
gleamed
like
an
ivory
pillar
to
look
up
at
the
ceiling
with
the
painted
vultures
the
emblem
of
maternity
the
man
looked
up
then
looked
down
upon
this
woman
of
his
mother
race
whom
he
loved
and
longed
with
all
the
intense
passion
of
his
race
that
he
might
see
his
upon
her
breast
she
was
trying
to
find
words
and
they
came
to
her
when
she
clasped
her
hands
upon
the
jewelled
brooch
in
the
shape
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
she
looked
at
him
suddenly
and
a
little
shiver
swept
her
at
the
strange
beauty
of
this
silent
man
and
he
as
suddenly
turned
his
hands
palm
upwards
in
an
uncontrollable
gesture
of
eastern
prayer
to
fate
who
had
so
much
to
give
him
or
perhaps
so
little
you
said
you
you
would
help
me
if
i
came
to
you
in
trouble
she
tripped
and
stumbled
over
the
words
i
have
come
to
to
ask
my
help
the
words
were
as
cold
as
stones
dropped
in
the
beggar
hand
but
damaris
leant
back
quickly
when
she
looked
into
the
man
eyes
and
saw
in
them
the
reflection
of
the
fire
she
had
kindled
what
is
the
help
you
need
of
me
i
know
nothing
of
the
ways
of
women
but
i
do
know
that
it
has
been
the
storm
which
has
swept
you
from
your
safe
harbour
out
towards
a
shore
upon
which
are
piled
the
wrecks
of
many
souls
she
twisted
the
brooch
between
her
fingers
my
wedding
gift
said
hugh
carden
ali
softly
then
watched
the
crimson
dye
the
white
neck
and
surge
across
her
face
you
come
to
for
help
he
repeated
the
words
slowly
then
you
of
course
are
are
free
ah
he
leant
forward
and
caught
her
hands
you
have
run
away
from
what
no
do
not
speak
i
can
read
your
answer
in
your
face
you
have
been
hurt
he
lifted
the
little
ringless
left
hand
then
pressed
it
against
the
other
between
his
own
whilst
a
great
light
flamed
in
his
eyes
you
have
come
to
me
and
there
is
but
one
meaning
for
me
in
that
you
have
come
to
is
it
his
voice
dropped
to
the
softest
whisper
as
he
crushed
her
hands
down
upon
the
wooden
couch
so
that
she
swayed
towards
him
is
it
that
i
may
fasten
my
own
wedding
gift
into
the
bridal
robe
of
the
woman
i
love
and
will
take
to
wife
it
damaris
bowed
her
head
so
that
the
curls
danced
and
glistened
in
the
light
as
the
torrent
of
his
words
in
the
egyptian
tongue
swept
about
her
like
a
flood
hast
thou
come
to
me
in
love
thou
dove
from
the
nest
nay
what
knowest
thou
of
love
i
ask
it
not
of
thee
yet
but
the
seed
i
shall
plant
within
thee
shall
grow
in
the
passing
of
the
days
and
the
nights
and
the
months
and
the
years
until
it
is
as
a
grove
of
perfumed
flowers
which
shall
change
to
golden
fruit
ready
to
the
plucking
of
my
hand
he
pressed
her
little
hands
back
against
her
breast
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
and
held
her
watching
the
colour
rise
and
fade
allah
he
whispered
allah
god
of
all
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
signs
of
thy
great
goodness
wilt
love
me
he
laughed
gently
canst
thou
look
into
mine
eyes
and
shake
thy
golden
head
which
shall
be
pillowed
upon
my
heart
my
wife
the
mother
of
my
children
look
at
me
look
at
me
ah
thine
eyes
which
were
as
the
pools
of
lebanon
at
night
are
as
a
sea
of
love
thou
it
not
but
love
is
within
thee
for
me
thy
master
and
was
there
not
truth
in
what
he
said
may
there
not
have
been
love
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
not
maybe
the
love
which
stands
sweet
and
sturdy
like
the
stocky
hyacinth
to
bloom
afresh
no
matter
how
often
the
flowers
be
struck
or
the
leaves
be
bruised
from
the
humdrum
bulb
deep
in
the
soil
of
quiet
content
but
the
iridescent
love
of
youth
for
youth
with
its
passion
so
swift
so
sweet
a
love
like
the
which
hangs
over
the
door
in
the
dawn
which
is
to
the
sun
at
noon
which
scatters
its
petals
at
dusk
the
rose
she
has
filled
your
days
with
the
memory
of
her
fragrance
her
leaves
still
scent
the
night
from
out
the
sealed
crystal
vase
which
is
your
heart
but
an
you
would
attain
the
priceless
boon
of
peace
see
to
it
that
a
humdrum
bulb
be
planted
in
the
brown
which
is
your
home
and
because
of
this
love
of
youth
which
was
causing
her
heart
to
thud
and
the
blood
to
race
through
her
veins
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hands
when
he
held
and
kissed
them
and
pressed
his
forehead
upon
them
he
whispered
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
bud
of
innocence
ivory
tower
of
womanhood
temple
of
love
beloved
beloved
i
am
at
thy
feet
and
he
knelt
and
kissed
the
little
feet
in
the
heelless
little
slippers
then
rising
took
both
her
hands
and
led
her
to
the
door
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
a
great
sadness
in
spite
of
the
joy
which
sang
in
his
heart
as
he
took
her
into
the
shelter
of
his
arms
i
love
thee
too
well
he
said
as
he
bent
and
kissed
the
riotous
curls
so
near
his
mouth
yea
i
love
thee
too
well
to
snatch
thee
even
as
a
hungry
dog
snatches
his
food
though
verily
i
be
more
near
to
starving
than
any
hungry
dog
what
dost
thou
know
of
love
of
life
in
the
strange
countries
of
the
east
for
thy
life
will
be
a
desert
life
my
love
if
once
thou
art
my
wife
look
up
look
around
thee
he
pointed
to
the
stars
he
pointed
to
the
dim
horizon
of
the
desert
over
which
at
that
very
moment
was
padding
that
hound
fate
wilt
thou
be
content
with
that
and
with
me
and
thy
children
wilt
thou
not
yearn
for
the
comforts
of
thy
heated
rooms
the
company
of
those
who
will
point
the
finger
of
scorn
maybe
at
thee
as
they
have
pointed
it
at
my
mother
he
spared
her
not
one
jot
as
he
made
plain
to
her
what
might
be
the
result
of
her
marriage
she
would
not
be
marrying
the
son
of
a
splendid
race
as
his
mother
had
done
she
would
be
the
wife
of
a
the
mixed
of
two
great
races
her
children
would
be
outcast
from
their
rightful
heritage
of
the
sons
of
the
east
and
the
west
the
women
of
her
race
would
not
own
her
the
women
of
his
father
race
would
not
permit
her
children
to
play
with
theirs
wealth
palaces
camels
horses
jewels
would
be
hers
a
place
for
her
children
in
the
seat
of
his
fathers
or
her
fathers
i
should
be
strong
i
should
be
strong
for
in
my
heart
something
tells
me
that
i
am
thinking
of
my
happiness
and
not
thine
your
mother
whispered
damaris
so
softly
that
he
had
to
bend
his
head
lower
still
so
that
when
she
moved
in
the
pain
of
his
arms
which
crushed
her
her
cheek
brushed
his
is
happy
everyone
says
so
happy
yes
she
was
happy
his
beloved
most
honoured
mother
at
least
she
had
been
until
there
had
come
the
question
of
her
child
happiness
her
child
then
he
laughed
joyfully
stretched
the
girl
arms
wide
then
crushed
her
hands
above
her
heart
of
course
of
course
he
cried
they
are
at
my
house
mahabbha
the
house
of
love
even
now
where
they
have
met
to
see
if
they
the
dears
thy
wise
old
godmother
my
beautiful
wise
mother
can
find
an
answer
to
this
very
question
they
were
not
sick
with
suspense
they
had
landed
on
the
far
side
of
the
nile
on
their
race
with
time
to
the
gate
of
we
will
go
to
them
thou
and
i
to
the
gate
of
thou
with
the
mare
i
with
the
stallion
sooltan
who
will
kill
thy
mare
my
woman
in
jealousy
yea
he
bent
and
whispered
in
her
ear
so
quietly
so
coldly
as
to
cause
the
girl
to
tremble
as
i
will
kill
anyone
who
looks
at
thee
when
thou
art
my
wife
then
he
laughed
like
a
boy
as
he
swung
her
round
and
held
her
at
by
both
hands
we
will
start
to
meet
them
when
we
will
lay
the
question
before
them
and
then
and
then
why
damaris
with
all
the
smart
of
the
wound
to
her
pride
revived
had
shaken
her
head
i
want
you
i
want
you
to
hugh
carden
ali
understood
by
the
grace
of
intuition
we
will
start
for
khargegh
he
continued
after
a
little
pause
and
at
the
same
time
if
it
will
please
thee
with
thy
consent
i
will
send
my
swiftest
runner
to
luxor

he
will
despatch

and
of
thy
country
have
i
thy
consent

damaris
nodded
having
cast
the
die
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
and
at
the
sight
of
her
white
with
big
frightened
eyes
staring
at
him
and
teeth
driven
into
her
lip
he
took
her
in
his
arms
thou
art
mine
beloved
mine
as
thou
hast
been
in
all
the
past
as
thou
wilt
be
in
all

ask

gather
no
pebble
from
the
path
nor
flower
from
the
tree
i
will
have
the
jewelled
necklace
of
thy
beauty
to
hang
above
my
heart
and
the
grove
of
thy
sweetness
in
which
to
take
my
rest
i
love
thee
and
for
the
agony
of
the
hours
passed
in
the
ruined
temples
i
will
take
my
reward
i
love
thee
love
thee
love
thee
she
made
no
sound
when
he
bent
and
kissed
her
hair
but
in
the
glory
of
the
love
which
is
that
of
youth
which
is
as
a
bud
at
dawn
the
full
flower
at
noon
and
a
few
petals
at
dusk
and
of
which
the
fragrance
stays
with
you
down
all
the
ages
she
raised
her
face
so
that
he
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
and
he
kissed
her
closed
eyes
and
the
pillar
of
her
throat
and
the
whiteness
of
her
shoulders
and
her
crimson
mouth
again
and
yet
again
in
the
wonder
of
this
his
hour
of
life
granted
him
by
allah
who
is
god
and
then
raised
his
head
and
stared
out
across
the
desert
from
a
great
distance
there
came
to
him
the
drumming
of
a
horse
hoofs
upon
the
sand

telephone
and
telegraph
but
above
all
by
the
magic
of
the
sheikh
name
and
his
wife
unlimited
distribution
of
gold
olivia
duchess
of
longacres
and
her
maid
and
jill
and
her
maid
arrived
at
the
hotel
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
they
would
have
arrived
before
sunset
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
mistake
made
about
the
special
steamer
which
had
kept
them
waiting
at
the
quay
they
would
not
have
arrived
until
hours
later
if
they
had
made
use
of
the
ordinary
train
and
boat
ca
we
go
faster
ca
we
get
there
quicker
it
was
maria
hobson
stolid
solid
dour
woman
with
a
streak
of
scotch
blood
in
her
veins
who
worried
outwardly
if
you
had
watched
her
out
of
the
corner
of
your
eye
you
would
have
seen
her
shake
her
fist
at
the
desert
if
you
had
walked
behind
her
on
the
quay
you
would
have
heard
her
say
with
a
world
of
entreaty
in
her
voice
to
some
terrified
who
quaked
at
the
knee
ca
you
get
a
move
on
somehow
you
only
a
heathen
to
be
sure
but
if
you
heard
the
tone
in
the
young
lady
voice
you
do
something
instead
of
she
said
very
little
to
her
beloved
mistress
but
to
jill
she
poured
out
her
heart
and
jill
who
with
the
intuition
of
a
mother
love
had
connected
the
dream
with
her
son
let
her
repeat
her
tale
over
and
over
again
just
as
though
she
was
standing
on
a
precipice
and
frightened
of
falling
over
was
her
voice
like
mum
miss
jill
may
i
call
you
miss
jill
it
more
and
homely
and
i
know
you
will
excuse
me
miss
jill
if
i
say
that
i
ca
get
used
to
you
in
those
clothes
pretty
as
they
are
and
becoming
to
you
it
seems
to
me
like
you
with
a
veil
over
your
face
if
you
will
excuse
me
saying
so
you
are
just
the
same
to
me
and
my
lady
as
when
you
came
to
stay
with
her
grace
and
glad
i
for
one
shall
be
when
i
see
the
barouche
waiting
for
her
at
victoria
with
whippup
and
his
powdered
head
on
the
box
i
do
mind
that
young
chauffeur
with
one
leg
lost
in
the
war
but
i
do
like
that
red
vermilion
of
her
grace
though
the
do
and
you
should
hear
them
cheer
miss
jill
when
it
goes
down
shadwell
way
this
conversation
took
place
on
the
quay
whilst
her
grace
was
absent
trying
to
still
the
unaccountable
fear
with
which
her
heart
had
been
filled
by
her
maid
dream
by
talking
to
the
little
brown
urchins
who
swarmed
about
her
the
better
to
view
the
bird
what
do
you
think
of
them
dekko
old
fellow
she
took
him
on
her
wrist
at
which
he
spread
his
tail
rattled
his
wings
and
puffed
his
ruff
whereupon
the
children
fled
yelling
come
now
say
something
nice
to
the
poor
little
things
you
frightened
them
ask
them
if
the
boat
is
ready
dekko
gave
a
sudden
piercing
screech
you
damned
dirty
lot
he
yelled
you
and
some
doubted
the
bird
sojourn
on
a
in
the
days
of
her
grace
rapped
the
beak
sharply
and
returned
to
the
other
two
just
in
time
to
hear
her
maid
answer
to
some
question
sergeant
of
the
irish
guards
miss
jill
he
demeaned
himself
by
marrying
a
miss
as
already
mentioned
love
and
marriage
had
passed
maria
hobson
by
arrived
at
the
hotel
their
spirits
went
up
with
a
bound
what
had
come
to
them
out
there
in
the
desert
town
had
they
all
been
stricken
with
some
dreadful
depression
of
course
the
child
was
safe
in
this
laughing
dancing
happy
throng
and
at
the
sight
of
her
she
would
leave
her
partner
and
run
to
her
would
throw
her
arms
about
her
and
hug
her
in
her
loving
way
owing
to
the
crowds
of
people
and
the
crush
of
cars
little
if
any
notice
had
been
taken
of
their
arrival
the
luggage
was
coming
up
later
wait
a
minute
here
hobson
had
said
her
grace
jill
come
and
see
if
you
can
recognise
damaris
by
the
picture
you
saw
of
her
the
prettiest
girl
in
egypt
they
stood
at
the
side
door
of
the
ballroom
and
scanned
the
laughing
couples
sitting
in
rows
in
the
throes
of
the
cotillon
ellen
thistleton
with
the
royal
asp
of
ancient
egypt
with
a
slight
list
to
starboard
above
her
heated
countenance
stood
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
glass
of
champagne
in
one
hand
before
her
stood
lumlough
and
the
colonel
for
whom
the
gilded
asp
was
being
worn
at
such
a
rakish
angle
she
stood
for
quite
some
seconds
in
her
conspicuous
position
as
though
debating
within
herself
upon
the
choice
as
lumlough
subsequently
remarked
to
his
panting
partner
in
his
customary
slang
she
had
a
nerve
then
with
head
on
one
side
she
coyly
handed
the
veuve
clicquot
to
the
thankful
young
man
and
allowed
herself
to
be
gathered
to
the
heart
of
the
portly
jubilant
colonel
who
loving
her
saw
the
jaunty
gilded
asp
as
a
nimbus
around
her
head
of
damaris
there
was
no
sign
and
the
old
lady
heart
through
some
unaccountable
terror
seemed
as
if
it
would
sink
into
her
small
crimson
shoes
though
outwardly
she
showed
no
sign
of
the
fear
that
gripped
her
i
expect
she
has
gone
upstairs
or
out
into
the
grounds
to
give
wellington
a
run
i
do
see
him
anywhere
come
hobson
give
me
your
arm
to
the
lift
a
deep
growl
welcomed
them
as
the
maid
opened
the
door
and
switched
on
the
light
as
the
ladies
entered
wellington
lay
near
the
balcony
window
head
on
paws
with
the
book
his
mistress
had
given
him
between
his
teeth
he
rose
slowly
very
slowly
eyes
red
ruff
bristling
round
the
spiked
collar
growling
menacingly
my
dear
said
the
duchess
quietly
just
stand
still
damaris
has
gone
away
he
is
always
like
this
when
she
has
left
him
hobson
go
and
see
if
you
can
find
jane
coop
i
hope
to
goodness
you
do
she
walked
across
the
room
and
passed
close
to
the
dog
who
turned
his
head
and
growling
savagely
watched
her
as
she
moved
then
she
came
back
and
sat
down
quite
near
him
and
leaning
down
arranged
the
buckle
on
her
shoe
whilst
jill
stood
perfectly
still
filled
with
admiration
for
the
old
woman
who
was
not
acting
out
of
bravado
but
simply
tackling
the
situation
in
the
only
possible
way
once
let
a
bulldog
on
guard
know
that
you
do
not
want
to
take
away
or
touch
his
possessions
and
that
you
are
not
in
the
least
bit
afraid
of
him
and
all
will
be
well
come
over
here
jill
jill
who
had
removed
her
veil
and
satin
mantle
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
on
a
stool
at
the
elder
woman
feet
she
took
the
wrinkled
little
old
hand
and
patted
it
then
they
sat
still
and
silent
hand
in
hand
waiting
for
the
maids
return
what
was
there
for
these
women
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
can
not
a
girl
be
allowed
to
sit
out
perhaps
a
dance
or
a
whole
cotillon
even
without
the
world
coming
to
an
end
what
made
them
all
three
fret
and
fuss
and
fear
the
great
love
they
had
one
for
the
other
perhaps
for
love
has
been
known
to
pierce
the
mental
fog
we
each
one
of
us
weave
about
ourselves
and
so
allow
us
to
help
one
another
sometimes
even
at
a
great
distance
maria
hobson
knocked
and
opened
jane
coop
door
who
rose
and
came
quickly
towards
her
and
as
her
grace
maid
involuntarily
glanced
round
the
room
old
nannie
peered
over
her
shoulder
with
the
hope
of
seeing
her
young
mistress
in
the
corridor
is
she
here
my
young
lady
no
she
dancing
she
paused
and
put
out
her
hand
is
she
dancing
is
she
why
did
jane
coop
fear
as
the
others
feared
and
why
did
her
bonny
face
go
suddenly
white
because
she
too
was
one
of
the
happy
limited
throng
who
know
what
real
love
is
my
mistress
would
like
to
speak
to
you
miss
coop
what
wrong
maria
hobson
tell
me
what
wrong
hobson
allowed
the
unlicensed
use
of
her
christian
name
to
pass
unnoticed
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
spoke
gently
as
she
took
the
other
woman
hand
and
shook
it
which
was
her
somewhat
masculine
way
of
showing
sympathy
i
do
know
none
of
us
know
that
anything
wrong
as
mike
used
to
say
may
be
afther
barking
in
the
wrong
but
i
had
a
dream
jane
coop
sit
you
down
whilst
telling
it
you
they
sat
on
the
sofa
hand
in
hand
strangely
like
their
mistresses
as
they
sat
in
the
near
the
suspicious
bulldog
at
the
end
of
the
story
of
the
dream
jane
coop
rose
thank
you
miss
hobson
i
thought
my
young
mistress
was
dancing
i
was
hoping
she
was
forgetting
a
bit
with
the
music
and
young
folk
there
one
thing
i
shall
know
where
she
has
gone
to
my
dearie
would
break
her
word
come
along
she
opened
the
door
and
turned
and
spoke
over
her
shoulder
drat
men
she
said
briefly
and
emphatically
yes
replied
maria
hobson
even
more
emphatically
as
her
memory
leapt
clear
across
the
gulf
of
years
to
the
time
when
she
had
walked
out
with
a
certain
sergeant
of
the
irish
guards
jane
coop
dropped
a
curtsey
to
the
gentry
and
stood
just
inside
the
door
up
in
arms
ready
to
fight
anyone
at
the
first
word
of
condemnation
of
her
young
mistress
come
over
here
coop
please
and
tell
me
everything
you
can
about
miss
damaris
i
have
an
idea
mind
you
i
am
not
sure
that
she
has
gone
out
alone
and
we
must
be
as
quick
as
we
can
in
finding
her
because
egypt
is
no
place
for
a
white
girl
to
be
running
about
in
by
herself
jane
coop
took
up
a
corner
of
the
big
white
apron
she
insisted
upon
wearing
and
pleated
it
between
her
fingers
as
she
told
her
grace
everything
with
a
surprising
lucidity
she
came
in
here
to
fetch
her
fan
your
grace
and
in
here
somewhere
she
will
have
left
me
a
message
i
never
known
my
baby
to
break
her
word
and
i
look
for
it
if
i
may
she
have
written
it
on
a
bit
of
this
block
and
with
this
pencil
it
been
thrown
down
in
a
hurry
miss
damaris
is
that
tidy
she
can
put
her
hand
on
anything
she
wants
in
the
dark
which
is
more
than
most
of
the
slipshod
young
ladies
of
the
present
day
could
do
the
anxious
maid
hid
her
fear
in
a
invective
against
the
pharaohs
and
their
descendants
down
to
the
present
generation
as
they
all
hunted
vainly
for
the
bit
of
paper
then
she
stood
helplessly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
apostrophised
the
dog
know
where
your
missie
gone
to
why
do
you
help
us
instead
of
lying
there
growling
she
stood
scowling
at
him
then
suddenly
walked
across
to
where
he
lay
i
wonder
if
she
put
it
inside
that
book
she
muttered
then
gave
a
little
cry
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
paper
twisted
in
the
steel
ring
of
the
spiked
collar
i
got
it
she
cried
i
got
it
the
duchess
who
was
quite
near
her
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
take
care
coop
the
dog
is
really
angry
let
me
get
it
not
you
your
grace
no
not
ever
so
bless
you
wellington
was
standing
on
the
book
great
tusks
gleaming
eyes
glaring
a
hideous
picture
of
rage
but
love
casts
out
fear
even
the
just
fear
of
a
dog
who
would
never
let
go
until
you
or
he
were
dead
once
he
got
his
teeth
into
any
part
of
yon
there
was
no
haste
about
jane
coop
as
she
knelt
beside
him
missie
wants
you
she
said
hear
the
ears
pricked
at
the
sound
of
the
beloved
name
but
the
whole
tremendous
body
shook
with
his
growling
response
you
do
love
her
you
brute
else
you
have
picked
up
the
book
and
been
ready
to
start
at
the
sound
of
her
name
i
teach
you
to
be
so
slow
with
a
sudden
lightning
movement
she
caught
hold
of
the
loose
skin
just
under
the
jaw
firmly
grimly
with
her
left
hand
holding
him
amazed
and
for
a
moment
helpless
as
she
pulled
the
paper
out
of
the
ring
then
she
let
go
and
pointed
to
the
book
just
as
the
dog
was
about
to
spring
missie
told
you
to
keep
it
for
her
the
room
vibrated
with
the
thunder
of
his
fury
as
he
placed
both
feet
on
the
book
and
glared
about
him
i
know
said
jill
as
she
read
the
message
over
the
old
shoulder
she
has
gone
to
my
son
to
his
tents
in
the
desert
she
spoke
quietly
and
with
a
certain
dignity
and
authority
which
checked
all
questions
he
will
take
her
straight
to
me
shall
we
go
back
to
khargegh
or
shall
i
go
to
them
to
his
tents
there
was
no
sign
of
the
triumph
in
the
at
the
thought
of
the
happiness
which
was
to
come
to
her
neither
had
she
a
single
thought
for
the
others
a
mother
love
is
the
most
surpassing
of
all
loves
it
is
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
it
is
a
mystery
before
which
that
of
the
sphinx
shrinks
to
insignificance
it
is
the
one
love
which
asks
for
so
very
little
in
return
for
all
it
gives
blessed
sanctified
refuge
against
all
harm
five
minutes
of
quick
discussion
rapid
weighing
of
the
pros
and
cons
as
to
the
best
way
to
keep
from
the
ears
that
which
would
serve
as
a
whetstone
to
the
tongues
of
the
scandalmongers
a
sharp
clear
understanding
and
decision
the
manager
of
the
hotel
salaamed
deeply
in
the
doorway
before
the
women
and
showed
no
surprise
at
the
tale
which
he
believed
perhaps
of
miss
hethencourt
who
had
gone
to
meet
her
grace
and
having
undoubtedly
mixed
up
instructions
had
either
gone
up
to
kulla
to
meet
her
crossing
her
on
the
river
or
had
crossed
to
the
other
side
thinking
as
her
grace
had
suggested
doing
that
the
return
from
kulla
would
be
made
by
camel
on
the
far
side
of
the
nile
good
gracious
no
he
had
long
since
given
up
showing
or
feeling
surprise
at
anything
any
of
the
great
white
races
might
elect
to
do
he
had
harboured
them
for
several
winters
in
his
hotel
you
see
certainly
everything
should
be
ready
in
the
quickest
possible
time
a
hamper
and
some
brandy
the
boat
and
upon
the
other
side
the
swiftest
camel
from
the
hotel
stables
for
her
excellency
the
wife
of
the
sheikh
the
swiftest
men
to
carry
a
litter
ah
two
litters
as
her
grace
maid
would
join
in
the
search
not
miss
coop
she
was
staying
behind
of
course
to
have
everything
in
readiness
for
miss
hethencourt
who
would
doubtless
be
very
tired
and
a
little
frightened
there
is
nothing
to
fear
he
added
nobody
has
ever
really
been
lost
in
egypt
and
as
miss
hethencourt
will
not
want
a
crowd
of
friends
to
meet
her
on
her
safe
return
not
one
word
shall
be
said
about
the
little
expedition
of
relief
he
salaamed
and
retired
leaving
the
duchess
looking
after
him
she
had
her
doubts
about
his
belief
in
one
word
of
the
story
wrapped
in
her
ermine
cloak
and
leaning
on
her
ebony
stick
olivia
duchess
of
longacres
stood
near
all
that
is
left
of
the
gate
of
hugh
carden
mother
looked
down
at
her
from
the
back
of
her
camel
on
which
had
been
fixed
the
padded
seat
which
is
perhaps
the
most
comfortable
of
all
saddles
wellington
with
the
book
between
his
teeth
sat
next
her
firmly
secured

and

incredible

of

out

on

lit

on
the
track
left
by
the
hoofs
of
two
horses
yes
two
just
an
hour
before
they
arrived
ben
kelham
had
started
from
the
gate
of
to
find
his
hugh
carden
ali
at
his
tents
of
purple
and
of
gold
chapter

is
true

tho
given
in

in
vain
and

is

who
puts
an
end
to
tennyson
hugh
carden
ali
quite
still
and
strangely
unwelcoming
stood
just
inside
his
tent
as
ben
kelham
flung
himself
off
his
horse
neither
did
he
put
out
his
hand
to
take
the
outstretched
one
of
his
old
pretending
not
to
notice
the
seeming
lapse
in
courtesy
kelham
turned
to
hitch
his
horse
only
to
find
that
that
product
of
the
bazaar
had
cleared
for
the
horizon
it
were
wise
when
out
in
the
desert
if
your
horse
is
not
to
hang
on
to
the
bridle
until
you
have
hobbled
or
hitched
your
steed
lest
peradventure
the
vultures
at
a
discreet
distance
should
assemble
about
you
later
as
you
lie
raving
upon
the
sands
only
waiting
until
your
ravings
cease
altogether
to
approach
quite
near
to
you
that
the
omission
was
intentional
never
crossed
his
mind
he
remembered
his
friend
religion
and
the
strictness
with
which
he
adhered
to
its
tenets
and
thought
that
perhaps
the
shaking
of
a
hand
was
forbidden
at
certain
hours
so
that
he
did
not
offer
his
hand
again
but
his
eyes
shone
with
all
the
affection
which
might
be
termed
love
he
had
had
at
harrow
for
the
man
who
had
met
him
so
often
as
opponent
in
the
and
as
a
friend
in
his
rooms
he
stood
quite
still
for
a
minute
just
outside
the
tent
the
moon
shining
down
upon
his
splendid
and
a
little
shadow
of
doubt
swept
across
the
face
of
the
eastern
as
so
strong
was
the
moonlight
he
noticed
the
set
of
the
jaw
and
the
honesty
of
purpose
in
the
steady
grey
eyes
this
englishman
might
make
a
mistake
might
blunder
in
the
slowness
of
his
deliberate
way
there
was
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
smile
on
hugh
carden
ali
face
as
he
remembered
even
at
this
critical
moment
how
having
won
the
toss
it
had
taken
ben
kelham
so
long
to
decide
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
whether
to
put
his
side
in
or
not
but
that
he
would
deliberately
behave
like
a
cad
to
anything
so
beautiful
and
desirable
as
damaris
or
in
fact
to
any
man
woman
child
or
beast
on
earth
no
that
thought
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
one
moment
come
to
think
of
it
what
a
blessing
it
is
that
the
cad
can
not
efface
the
mark
of
nature
he
may
be
an
adonis
a
diplomat
a
a
good
sort
a
real
sport
he
may
have
a
brain
and
a
personality
and
a
gift
for
choosing
and
wearing
his
clothes
his
blood
may
be
cerulean
red
or
merely
muddy
but
just
watch
out
one
day
he
will
forget
to
shoot
his
linen
and
you
will
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
in
the
second
of
time
which
it
took
this
little
analysis
of
his
friend
to
flash
across
his
mind
the
hands
of
life
moved
slowly
towards
the
hour
he
put
his
hand
to
his
turban
then
stood
on
one
side
come
in
kelham
who
ever
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
jolly
decent
of
you
coming
all
this
way
out
to
see
me
i
thought
you
were
after
lion
but
i
see
you
have
no
gun
i
afraid
i
can
only
offer
you
coffee
no
pegs
in
a
mohammedan
tent
you
see
they
each
advanced
one
step
and
their
hands
met
and
gripped
across
the
little
on
one
side
of
which
one
of
the
two
stood
under
the
stars
which
belong
to
all
men
and
the
other
inside
the
desert
dwelling
such
a
faint
line
this
one
of
racial
distinction
yet
which
rises
as
a
barrier
higher
than
the
himalayas
deeper
than
the
ocean
and
stronger
than
steel
between
the
men
of
the
east
and
the
men
of
the
west
kelham
laughed
as
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
wooden
couch
to
which
without
making
any
apology
for
the
bareness
of
the
tent
his
host
had
pointed
jolly
seeing
you
again
carden
i
had
an
idea
you
were
travelling
round
the
world
and
only
discovered
through
the
morning
paper
that
you
were
quite
near
the
paragraph
gave
a
full
description
of
you
and
these
tents
so
i
took
the
first
train
i
was
in
cairo
enquired
about
you
when
i
arrived
at
luxor
station
where
they
seemed
to
know
all
about
you
hired
that
horse
which
has
just
gone
off
on
a
survey
into
the
middle
of
the
desert
got
ferried
across
and
came
straight
here
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
lion
is
rather
a
sore
point
with
me
at
present
he
laughed
again
as
he
took
his
automatic
colt
which
lay
cosily
in
the
palm
of
his
big
hand
from
his
pocket
and
released
the
i
like
darling
old
aunt
olivia
she
refuses
to
be
parted
from
hers
once
she
has
sighted
port
said
by
jove
carden
you
absolutely
got
to
meet
her
if
you
have
met
her
already
she
knew
your
mother
well
but
of
course
you
stayed
at
the
castle
no
you
did
though
you
had
measles
well
you
got
to
meet
he
stopped
suddenly
as
the
thought
of
the
abominable
anonymous
letter
flashed
across
his
mind
turned
a
dull
red
under
his
tan
and
looked
round
the
strange
tent
and
then
at
the
man
who
sat
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
wooden
couch
dressed
in
all
the
picturesque
simplicity
of
the
east
with
the
stars
and
the
desert
as
a
background
he
sat
quite
silent
staring
at
his
friend
who
yet
in
some
indefinable
way
seemed
such
a
total
stranger
by
jove
carden
he
said
at
last
i
did
know
you
had
he
stopped
confused
horrified
at
the
words
which
had
almost
escaped
him
turned
native
kelham
i
have
i
am
an
arab
a
mohammedan
by
birth
this
he
looked
quickly
at
the
leather
curtain
at
the
back
of
his
friend
this
is
my
natural
environment
harrow
was
a
a
loving
thought
on
the
part
of
my
honoured
mother
and
he
paused
and
raising
his
voice
ever
so
slightly
looked
steadily
at
the
curtain
which
seemed
to
move
perchance
blown
by
the
night
wind
and
a
great
a
terrible
mistake
yes
kelham
a
terrible
mistake
did
you
ever
think
of
the
risk
i
ran
i
an
arab
of
meeting
some
white
woman
whom
i
might
love
supposing
i
had
met
such
an
one
and
had
loved
her
and
had
wanted
to
marry
her
tell
me
you
all
white
as
you
are
i
have
done
so
he
took
a
simple
wooden
from
his
cummerbund
and
held
it
out
to
his
friend
they
lit
their
cigarettes
and
sat
smoking
in
an
intolerable
silence
there
was
no
real
need
to
ask
the
question
because
it
had
been
answered
even
whilst
the
englishman
had
swung
himself
from
the
saddle
in
a
searing
flash
by
the
sound
of
his
friend
voice
the
way
he
moved
the
whole
western
look
of
him
carden
ali
had
understood
that
this
man
born
of
the
moors
the
bracing
climate
the
cold
skies
the
snows
and
springs
of
england
was
the
true
mate
for
beautiful
english
damaris
but
to
turn
the
knife
in
the
wound
in
his
heart
he
repeated
the
question
and
kelham
who
knew
it
could
be
answered
only
in
one
way
wrenched
at
his
collar
and
got
to
his
feet
and
crossed
to
the
wall
to
finger
the
with
his
back
to
his
friend
well
you
know
old
man
i
well
do
you
think
it
best
as
your
father
is
an
arab
well
well
you
know
what
who
was
it
said
something
about
east
and
west
i
do
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
wall
then
exclaimed
in
an
effort
to
change
the
subject
by
jove
it
leather
why
i
thought
the
wall
was
velvet
carden
laughed
and
lit
another
cigarette
as
he
watched
kelham
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
walked
slowly
round
the
tent
keeping
something
from
each
other
they
were
ill
at
ease
where
under
ordinary
circumstances
they
would
have
talked
without
ceasing
upon
the
good
old
days
at
harrow
of
houses
and
masters
and
schoolfellows
of
ducker
the
and
lords
and
bill
the
they
talked
instead
disjointedly
upon
things
which
though
they
interested
them
mightily
were
not
near
their
hearts
as
is
the
hill
to
the
harrovian
they
had
both
come
to
a
decision
which
however
left
them
in
nowise
comforted
ben
kelham
decided
as
he
walked
about
the
tent
that
not
a
word
about
the
anonymous
letter
or
the
courtesan
should
pass
his
lips
how
could
he
ever
have
thought
of
mentioning
the
matter
even
if
it
had
been
only
as
a
safeguard
for
the
future
in
finding
out
the
best
way
in
which
to
silence
the
woman
lying
tongue
besides
if
carden
he
thought
had
met
damaris
or
the
duchess
he
would
most
surely
have
said
so
which
only
showed
that
he
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
oriental
hugh
carden
ali
had
come
to
his
decision
even
as
he
had
realised
that
honour
bade
him
give
up
the
girl
whom
he
had
held
so
close
to
his
heart
in
his
one
hour
reft
from
life
on
the
pretext
of
want
of
accommodation
with
promise
to
meet
in
cairo
or
elsewhere
as
soon
as
possible
he
would
send
ben
kelham
back
upon
the
track
to
luxor
and
by
a
circuitous
route
would
take
the
girl
at
dawn
to
a
spot
from
whence
she
could
ride
to
kulla
and
get
from
there
by
boat
to
denderah
or
back
to
luxor
none
save
the
knew
she
had
come
to
the
tents
this
night
and
he
was
faithful
and
as
dumb
as
a
dog
besides
the
oriental
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
he
should
prove
to
be
otherwise
what
easier
than
to
silence
him
for
all
eternity
and
if
a
life
barren
of
love
stretched
as
bleak
and
limitless
as
the
desert
before
him
what
then
life
was
short
and
if
children
of
mixed
races
were
to
suffer
the
hell
he
must
suffer
through
honour
well
surely
praise
should
be
offered
to
allah
in
that
he
would
never
see
his
upon
the
breast
of
woman
kismet
he
whispered
the
oriental
supreme
submission
to
the
inevitable
and
caught
his
breath
then
lit
another
cigarette
ben
kelham
placed
his
hand
upon
the
chequered
curtain
which
swung
back
at
his
touch
is
this
where
you
sleep
carden
i
never
thought
you
had
another
room
behind
it
is
the
room
in
which
i
make
my
ablutions
prescribed
by
mohammed
the
prophet
of
allah
who
is
god
at
the
hour
of
prayer
the
words
which
were
in
truth
a
prayer
for
the
safe
keeping
of
the
woman
be
loved
and
had
renounced
rang
sonorously
through
the
tent
causing
ben
kelham
to
turn
and
look
at
the
oriental
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
as
he
prayed
the
two
fine
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
across
the
tent
then
the
englishman
moved
forward
and
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
wooden
couch
as
the
other
moved
back
and
leant
against
the
wall
with
his
fingers
upon
the
little
amulet
above
his
heart
have
you
ever
been
in
love
carden
kelham
asked
abruptly
unable
to
control
the
question
there
is
no
in
love
you
either
love
or
you
do
not
love
do
you
ben
kelham
nodded
his
head
then
if
you
do
why
in
the
name
of
allah
who
is
your
god
as
well
as
mine
are
you
here
why
are
you
not
at
the
feet
of
this
woman
stricken
with
wonder
and
humility
before
the
gifts
the
great
god
has
given
you
why
do
you
leave
her
exposed
to
the
temptations
of
the
east
where
has
been
wrecked
the
soul
of
many
a
white
woman
what
is
the
killing
of
wild
beasts
compared
to
the
look
of
the
woman
eyes
where
are
your
eyes
the
eyes
of
your
soul
what
is
this
love
you
speak
of
which
lets
you
drop
the
jewel
from
between
your
fingers
as
you
would
drop
the
cigarette
upon
the
ground
it
was
the
prisoner
last
despairing
cry
as
the
swings
to
shutting
out
the
sun
the
song
of
birds
the
voice
of
children
it
was
the
beggar
hungering
for
a
crust
crying
against
the
wasted
abundance
of
the
rich
man
table
what
is
this
love
you
speak
of
this
love
which
lets
you
pass
your
days
in
the
shadow
of
another
woman
a
woman
brown
as
a
burned
cake
as
comely
as
a
stuffed
pillow
who
lies
in
wait
to
kill
the
king
of
beasts
yes
i
know
in
the
east
all
things
are
known
i
know
whom
it
is
you
love
and
it
is
for
her
that
i
dare
speak
as
men
should
not
speak
of
woman
go
to
her
tarry
not
go
and
heal
the
wound
to
her
pride
her
heart
her
love
lest
in
her
pain
she
should
fly
to
the
first
hand
for
succour
ben
kelham
sprang
to
his
feet
do
you
think
if
my
love
was
returned
carden
that
i
should
be
here
love
the
man
voice
was
not
raised
one
tone
but
the
tent
vibrated
with
the
passionate
words
are
you
such
a
coward
that
you
run
away
at
the
first
hurt
when
the
ball
struck
you
in
the
face
at
lords
did
you
retire
hurt
no
you
stuck
it
and
scored
a
century
are
you
such
a
dullard
that
you
can
not
read
beneath
a
woman
yes
and
no
love
do
you
know
what
love
means
what
would
you
do
for
love
could
you
forgive
in
love
kelham
stared
at
the
man
who
word
for
word
repeated
the
question
damaris
had
asked
on
the
night
he
had
proposed
to
her
if
you
heard
tongues
gossiping
out
of
jealousy
of
the
woman
you
loved
if
you
found
her
in
a
situation
which
could
not
easily
be
explained
if
she
hurt
wounded
had
run
like
a
little
child
to
another
to
beg
for
balm
for
her
wound
tell
me
would
you
forgive
her
tell
me
there
was
a
strange
insistency
in
the
repeated
question
and
a
deep
anxiety
in
his
eyes
which
passed
as
kelham
laughed
it
was
the
genuine
honest
laugh
of
the
man
who
loves
and
is
willing
to
shoulder
the
burdens
great
and
small
which
love
brings
in
her
train
you
say
there
is
no
in

i
say
there
is
no
question
of
forgiveness
in
love
you
love
and
there
is
no
room
anywhere
for
anything
else
but
love
a
great
silence
fell
the
silence
of
two
strong
men
who
for
one
moment
had
broken
through
the
of
convention
to
be
their
natural
selves
the
silence
heralding
the
birth
of
a
new
day
there
was
no
sound
as
the
hands
of
fate
pointed
to
the
full
hour
it
all
happened
and
was
over
even
as
the
hour
struck
there
was
a
shout
from
both
men
as
the
tawny
shape
leapt
out
of
the
night
through
the
opening
of
the
tent
the
crashing
report
of
ben
kelham
revolver
as
he
fired
the
coughing
of
the
wounded
lioness
as
spitting
blood
she
recoiled
to
spring
a
ringing
shout
from
hugh
carden
ali
as
he
flung
himself
in
front
of
his
friend
just
as
he
fired
and
the
great
brute
with
a
mighty
roar
turned
and
disappeared
into
the
night
whence
she
had
come
there
was
a
look
of
great
wonder
on
the
face
of
hugh
carden
ali
as
he
stood
looking
beyond
his
friend
then
he
suddenly
turned
in
the
direction
of
mecca
slowly
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
turban
whilst
a
look
of
ineffable
peace
swept
across
his
face
and
stayed
as
a
little
red
stain
like
a
crimson
rose
showed
just
above
his
heart
the
answer
to
the
rang
out
across
the
desert
he
had
loved
so
well
and
was
carried
by
the
breeze
of
dawn
up
through
the
stars
to
the
head
master
whose
justice
and
mercy
take
no
account
of
race
then
the
old
harrovian
crashed
face
downward

every
part
milton
the
light
from
the
silver
lamp
shone
down
upon
the
water
in
the
crystal
basin
and
upon
the
girl
red
head
as
she
crouched
upon
her
knees
against
the
leather
curtain
well
might
she
crouch
well
might
she
have
put
dust
upon
her
head
as
do
the
easterns
in
their
grief
and
shame
well
might
her
voice
have
wailed
out
across
the
desert
in
sorrow
for
the
young
life
broken
by
the
careless
fingers
of
her
heedless
youth
but
she
knelt
without
movement
with
her
face
in
her
hands
the
hands
which
had
so
lightly
played
with
a
man
heart
and
a
man
life
and
prayed
desperately
silently
for
forgiveness
let
it
be
granted
her
on
account
of
her
years
for
youth
is
ever
blind
and
the
young
are
ever
selfish
giving
never
a
thought
to
the
years
they
must
spend
when
and
wise
they
will
try
to
repair
with
their
shaking
old
hands
the
tatters
and
rents
they
had
made
in
their
thoughtless
grasping
youth
strange
it
is
that
the
old
in
years
in
sorrow
and
knowledge
will
sit
darning
the
rents
and
patching
the
bad
places
with
their
trembling
hands
as
their
wise
old
heads
nod
and
their
dear
old
mouths
murmur
a
prayer
and
yet
be
unable
to
teach
the
young
how
to
keep
the
fabric
of
life
whole
or
safeguard
it
with
the
lavender
of
love
and
pressed
between
its
folds
until
the
drumming
of
the
sands
had
sounded
like
distant
thunder
and
the
shape
of
the
horse
and
its
rider
had
become
distinct
to
the
eye
of
her
desert
lover
damaris
remained
apprehensive
and
silent
in
the
safe
refuge
of
his
arms
which
crushed
her
to
his
heart
then
he
lifted
her
and
carried
her
swiftly
to
the
little
room
of
prayer
lit
by
the
silver
lamp
and
wresting
a
promise
from
her
to
keep
her
presence
hidden
no
matter
what
she
might
hear
through
the
curtain
kissed
her
hands
one
and
twice
and
yet
again
and
left
her
drawing
the
curtain
close
horrified
she
heard
the
voice
of
ben
kelham
like
a
statue
of
fear
she
stood
with
her
ear
close
to
the
curtain
for
the
half
of
an
hour
the
thirty
short
minutes
in
which
she
came
to
understand
at
last
clearly
definitely
that
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
world
for
her
and
that
was
the
englishman
who
sat
with
clenched
hands
under
the
lash
of
his
friend
words
and
her
hand
trembled
so
that
the
curtain
shook
as
though
blown
by
the
as
she
held
it
back
just
wide
enough
to
look
through
without
being
seen
and
her
eyes
were
soft
with
gratitude
when
she
understood
the
greatness
of
the
sacrifice
the
man
of
the
east
had
laid
on
the
altar
of
his
honour
and
his
friendship
and
his
love
but
her
youth
had
gone
from
her
forever
and
her
heart
had
been
stamped
with
the
seal
of
an
everlasting
regret
her
eyes
had
been
filled
with
a
great
questioning
which
was
never
to
be
answered
on
this
earth
when
her
scream
had
been
drowned
in
the
crash
of
the
report
as
the
man
she
loved
had
fired
and
killed
his
friend
had
hugh
carden
ali
really
feared
for
the
safety
of
his
friend
and
flung
himself
between
him
and
the
wounded
beast
or
understanding
that
in
that
way
only
could
peace
be
obtained
for
all
three
had
he
deliberately
sought
death
allah
who
is
god
of
all
alone
knows
the
answer
so
let
us
leave
it
with
him
and
then
being
untried
and
very
young
she
slipped
to
her
knees
and
fell
unconscious
with
her
face
upon
her
outstretched
arms
and
there
she
lay
whilst
the
silence
of
the
coming
dawn
fell
upon
the
earth
and
wrapped
itself
in
a
soft
about
him
who
lay
asleep
upon
his
couch
of
death
at
the
foot
of
which
stood
his
friend
looking
down
upon
the
peaceful
face
only
a
few
moments
had
slipped
into
eternity
when
damaris
shivered
and
bewildered
not
knowing
if
an
hour
or
a
second
had
passed
whilst
she
had
lain
senseless
rose
to
her
knees
there
was
no
sound
she
sat
back
and
pushed
the
hair
from
her
forehead
then
rose
and
tiptoed
to
the
curtain
she
put
out
her
hand
and
drew
back
then
urged
by
a
desire
which
clamoured
for
definite
knowledge
parted
the
curtain
and
looked
in
she
looked
for
just
one
second
then
staggered
back
and
back
as
far
as
the
crystal
basin
filled
with
the
clear
water
which
was
used
in
prayer
and
she
stood
with
her
arms
outstretched
and
fingers
spread
between
her
eyes
and
the
picture
she
herself
had
painted
in
the
thoughtlessness
of
youth
and
then
swung
round
with
her
back
to
the
tent
of
death
and
looked
down
into
the
water
and
as
though
a
veil
had
been
lifted
from
before
her
eyes
looked
back
along
the
past
and
forward
into
the
future
as
in
a
flash
she
saw
the
wreck
she
had
made
of
her
life
by
throwing
away
the
substance
of
a
good
man
love
for
the
fantastic
conviction
that
as
she
was
not
as
other
girls
she
must
therefore
go
through
the
world
mazy
and
until
she
had
found
her
own
particular
niche
she
saw
the
picture
of
herself
proclaiming
it
to
her
life
by
throwing
away
the
substance
of
a
good
man
godmother
letter
of
invitation
to
egypt
she
saw
the
girl
lips
moving
what
was
she
saying
i
want
to
find
my
own
nail
and
hang
for
one
hour
by
myself
if
it
on
a
barn
door
or
the
wall
of
a
mosque
as
long
as
i
am
by
myself
then
the
picture
faded
to
give
place
to
another
in
which
she
saw
herself
sitting
in
the
moonlight
beside
ben
kelham
the
honest
slow
lovable
man
standing
at
that
very
moment
a
grim
picture
of
despair
divided
only
by
a
curtain
from
her
through
whom
indirectly
he
had
killed
his
friend
what
was
she
saying
to
him
in
this
i
do
know
enough
to
marry
i
want
to
know
what
love
really
is
first
what
was
he
saying
in
reply
you
will
learn
your
lesson
all
right
dear
and
suffer
a
bit
dear
but
you
will
come
to
me
in
the
end
she
suddenly
knelt
and
plunged
her
hand
down
into
the
water
breaking
the
smooth
surface
into
a
thousand
miniature
waves
which
turned
as
she
stared
into
the
mocking
smiles
of
her
acquaintances
and
friends
and
she
knelt
quite
still
until
the
surface
was
once
more
smooth
out
of
which
as
she
stared
looked
the
tragic
face
of
the
dead
man
mother
and
the
shamed
face
of
her
beloved
godmother
the
gossip
the
scandal
with
her
name
linked
as
lover
to
that
dead
man
the
chuckles
the
sly
lifting
of
eyebrow
and
pursing
of
lips
when
it
should
be
known
that
the
other
man
the
dead
man
greatest
friend
had
come
upon
them
unawares
alone
in
the
tent
at
night
the
story
of
this
struggle
the
shooting
of
the
treacherous
friend
for
who
would
believe
the
story
told
by
the
principals
in
the
drama
of
a
wounded
lion
which
had
turned
and
disappeared
into
the
night
there
would
be
the
inquest
the
inquiry
the
arrest
for
murder
and
the
trial
in
which
she
and
all
those
she
loved
would
be
pilloried
through
her
fault
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
stared
down
at
the
water
which
seemed
to
hold
her
hands
in
the
icy
grip
of
death
her
hands
look
what
was
that
what
had
happened
to
them
they
were
spotted
with
red
she
tore
at
her
handkerchief
and
rubbed
them
under
the
water
rubbed
hard
rubbed
frantically
but
the
red
spots
were
there
on
her
hands
on
her
handkerchief
on
the
water
the
red
she
had
seen
when
she
had
looked
she
flung
the
handkerchief
from
her
and
rose
to
her
feet
shaking
convulsively
from
head
to
foot
poor
child
from
horror
from
fatigue
and
want
of
food
she
had
mistaken
the
reflection
of
the
jewelled
hawk
she
wore
at
her
breast
thrown
by
the
lamp
upon
the
water
for
the
stain
she
had
seen
and
which
had
looked
like
a
crimson
rose
above
the
heart
of
hugh
carden
ali
as
he
lay
asleep
with
his
feet
turned
towards
mecca
god
she
prayed
you
who
alone
can
save
me
and
everyone
from
shame
you
who
can
hide
me
from
ben
show
me
a
way
out
show
me
a
way
out
and
as
she
repeated
the
words
the
answer
came
of
course
she
whispered
right
out
in
the
desert
out
on
the
sands
alone
with
my
shame
where
when
this
has
been
forgotten
perhaps
all
that
will
be
left
of
me
will
be
found
by
some
wandering
bedouin
who
will
bury
me
deep
in
the
sand
she
was
genuinely
remorseful
and
horrified
at
what
she
had
done
but
also
was
she
as
are
so
many
of
us
who
do
not
really
feel
deeply
pleasurably
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
the
dramatic
picture
in
which
she
should
be
the
centre
figure
if
only
men
knew
it
that
is
why
so
many
women
create
such
terrific
scenes
over
nothing
at
all
it
gives
them
a
chance
of
donning
their
most
effective
gown
and
pulling
their
hair
if
their
own
down
about
their
shoulders
not
even
then
did
she
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
love
she
parted
the
curtain
at
the
back
of
the
room
of
prayer
and
looked
out
across
the
desert
and
behold
standing
upon
the
tips
of
slender
feet
wrapped
about
in
binding
cloths
of
grey
and
white
there
stood
a
figure
and
the
wind
of
dawn
upon
whose
wings
are
wafted
the
liberated
souls
into
the
safe
keeping
of
allah
who
is
god
lifted
for
one
instant
the
veil
from
before
the
face
just
for
a
moment
she
looked
upon
the
eyes
alight
with
no
earthly
happiness
and
the
tender
mouth
smiling
in
farewell
and
then
the
wind
lifted
the
soft
cloth
of
grey
and
white
and
bound
it
across
the
hawklike
face
the
figure
stood
with
beckoning
hand
outstretched
and
to
the
girl
was
granted
the
vision
of
the
legions
at
dawn
there
was
no
sound
in
all
the
limitless
desert
yet
the
air
was
filled
as
with
the
tramp
of
feet
the
thunder
of
horses
the
rumble
of
wheels
they
came
from
nowhere
those
countless
legions
from
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
spent
night
they
walked
in
phalanxes
the
uncountable
spirits
of
dead
kingdoms
with
eyes
uplifted
to
the
dawn
spears
raised
mouths
open
with
their
shouts
of
welcome
to
the
break
of
day
they
rode
their
horses
thundering
down
the
path
of
time
they
drove
their
chariots
straight
towards
the
cup
of
gold
which
rested
on
the
rim
of
the
world
they
come
from
nowhere
those
countless
legions
from
out
the
shadows
of
the
spent
night
they
journey
over
the
ordained
path
which
they
have
trod
since
the
beginning
of
time
which
has
no
beginning
and
which
they
will
tread
unto
the
end
of
all
time
which
shall
have
no
end
and
laughing
or
sobbing
hoping
despairing
we
shall
fall
in
as
our
line
passes
and
go
marching
along
with
them
marching
along
until
we
came
to
the
place
where
shadow
of
the
god
is
like
a
ram
set
with
lapis
lazuli
adorned
with
gold
and
with
precious
wait
for
me
the
whisper
was
just
a
part
of
the
shadows
as
the
girl
turned
her
face
to
the
east
wrapped
in
her
satin
cloak
she
walked
wearily
on
and
on
her
eyes
were
wide
open
staring
in
a
terrible
fatigue
she
saw
nothing
her
heelless
slippers
were
torn
to
shreds
her
feet
were
bleeding
she
felt
nothing
not
once
did
she
look
up
or
back
or
round
had
she
done
so
she
might
have
noticed
that
her
footprints
in
the
sand
were
describing
a
circle
as
our
footprints
do
when
we
are
lost
in
the
bush
or
the
desert
the
shadows
had
gone
and
the
sands
stretched
a
carpet
of
rose
and
grey
and
gold
before
her
the
sky
a
canopy
of
blue
and
grey
and
purple
above
like
a
lighthouse
of
hope
day
was
flashing
his
golden
beams
across
the
sky
a
message
to
the
weary
who
have
toiled
through
the
night
and
then
with
one
great
leap
he
sprang
clear
of
the
horizon
just
as
damaris
stopped
she
looked
back
in
the
direction
in
which
she
thought
she
had
come
there
was
no
sign
of
the
tents
there
could
not
be
they
were
not
out
of
sight
but
merely
wrapped
in
the
mist
which
sometimes
rises
as
a
fog
in
the
desert
at
dawn
let
me
die
soon
let
me
die
soon
a
great
sob
shook
her
as
she
prayed
the
prayer
of
the
weak
how
much
easier
is
it
to
stand
at
the
window
with
the
police
battering
at
the
door
and
stimulated
by
its
morbid
interest
blow
out
our
brains
before
the
gaping
crowd
which
will
by
the
way
take
exactly
the
same
morbid
interest
in
the
shooting
of
a
horse
in
the
street
than
to
retire
into
the
silence
of
the
or
seclusion
of
the
tideless
backwater
and
there
work
out
our
salvation
amongst
those
who
do
not
know
if
our
name
is
smith
or
jones
or
brown
and
much
less
care
in
the
intensity
of
her
prayer
she
clasped
her
hands
upon
the
jewelled
symbol
upon
her
breast
and
looked
up
from
out
of
the
west
cleaving
the
air
like
a
thrown
spear
flying
straight
towards
the
sun
in
greeting
there
came
a
hawk
up
up
it
sped
as
though
to
pierce
the
very
heavens
then
hovered
wheeled
and
swooped
downwards
above
the
girl
she
flung
out
her
arms
as
its
symbol
struck
through
her
clouded
senses
and
unconsciously
called
the
luring
call
she
had
heard
but
once
when
she
had
first
seen
the
man
who
lay
asleep
in
the
tent
in
the
of
the
arabian
quarter
in
cairo
sweet
and
clear
her
voice
rose
through
the
morning
air
rising
until
the
bird
caught
the
sound
and
just
as
she
swayed
and
fell
swooped
down
it
came
straighter
than
a
shaft
of
rain
swept
across
her
like
the
wind
rose
and
sailed
away
there
was
no
call
to
bring
it
back
now
the
falconer
who
had
thrown
it
as
was
the
custom
at
sunrise
was
upon
his
knees
with
his
forehead
upon
the
ground
in
sign
of
a
great
grief
taking
no
notice
of
his
master

which
he
had
petted
and
trained
it
flew
towards

it
flew
away
it
was

again

shelley
ben
kelham
sat
on
the
ground
with
his
head
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
wooden
couch
so
that
his
friend
satin
coat
touched
his
cheek
save
for
his
hands
clenched
round
his
knee
there
was
no
sign
of
the
grief
which
was
breaking
his
heart
which
had
drawn
great
lines
across
his
face
and
had
turned
him
in
one
hour
from
a
youth
into
a
grave
man
with
steady
sorrowful
grey
eyes
there
was
no
sound
as
he
sat
staring
in
front
of
him
as
the
light
of
the
lamp
grew
dim
in
the
coming
light
of
day
there
was
no
movement
anywhere
save
for
the
chequered
curtain
behind
his
friend
which
stirred
as
though
blown
by
the
wind
of
dawn
they
seemed
to
be
alone
quite
alone
in
the
desert
these
two
who
had
been
known
as
david
and
jonathan
in
the
days
on
the
hill
and
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
calm
face
and
in
the
soft
light
it
seemed
that
the
brown
eyes
were
looking
at
him
from
under
lids
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
the
arms
which
were
folded
across
the
breast
in
an
attitude
of
surpassing
dignity
carden
old
fellow
he
said
wake
up
as
his
friend
slept
on
he
spoke
more
clearly
repeating
the
line
out
of
the
which
had
acted
like
a
charm
in
those
days
when
love
and
pain
and
death
had
been
mere
words
to
them
carden
he
called
carden
a
quarter
to
seven
there
goes
the
and
when
there
came
no
answer
he
turned
and
buried
his
head
on
his
arms
so
he
sat
and
kept
his
vigil
with
never
a
thought
to
the
outcome
of
it
all
servants
there
must
be
somewhere
he
knew
but
time
enough
to
explain
things
when
they
appeared
time
enough
to
face
the
world
with
the
terrible
tale
time
oh
a
whole
long
life
in
which
to
regret
and
he
ached
with
a
great
longing
to
look
upon
the
girl
he
loved
he
longed
passionately
to
be
able
to
tell
her
everything
before
he
must
tell
others
he
threw
out
his
arms
in
a
vain
hope
that
perhaps
he
could
reach
her
and
drawing
her
to
him
put
his
head
down
upon
her
knees
and
tell
her
of
his
love
for
his
friend
which
had
almost
equalled
his
love
for
her
his
one
moment
of
doubt
when
a
vile
hand
had
linked
their
names
together
his
happiness
when
the
friend
he
had
doubted
had
lashed
him
with
words
and
told
him
bluntly
to
try
again
then
he
sat
up
and
turned
and
looked
out
into
the
desert
and
got
to
his
feet
but
his
hand
did
not
go
to
his
hip
pocket
as
he
watched
something
which
came
running
fleetly
through
the
shadows
iouaa
and
touaa
the
dogs
of
billi
were
racing
home
to
tell
their
master
of
a
surprising
adventure
which
had
befallen
them
ever
so
far
out
in
the
desert
where
they
had
gone
for
an
evening
stroll
before
taking
up
their
posts
as
sentries
outside
his
tent
for
the
night
and
if
only
he
had
not
shaken
his
head
when
they
asked
him
to
go
with
them
and
he
had
had
his
on
and
all
would
have
seen
for
himself
that
there
was
every
excuse
in
the
world
for
them
being
out
so
late
at
night
what
matter
if
they
were
a
disgrace
to
look
upon
with
their
shaggy
hair
matted
with
sand
and
what
looked
suspiciously
like
blood
what
if
one
of
touaa
ears
hung
limp
and
iouaa
tail
hung
down
the
lioness
was
dead
and
they
were
coming
just
as
hard
as
they
could
pelt
to
ask
him
to
come
and
see
they
knew
exactly
what
he
would
say
and
do
when
they
rushed
upon
him
he
would
hold
up
his
hand
and
say
you
pair
of
disreputable
tikes
he
always
did
and
pull
them
to
him
touaa
first
because
she
was
a
lady
and
would
run
his
hands
over
them
to
feel
for
bumps
and
turn
back
their
ears
and
lips
and
look
at
the
pads
of
their
feet
and
give
them
a
good
cuff
and
lead
them
off
if
they
were
scarred
with
battle
right
away
to
another
tent
and
there
he
himself
would
wash
their
faces
and
their
wounds
and
brush
the
sand
out
of
their
coats
and
but
of
course
this
was
a
deadly
secret
would
prize
open
their
mouths
and
wash
out
all
the
remains
of
whatever
they
had
been
chewing
or
chasing
with
a
ivory
brush
of
course
he
would
not
do
all
this
because
this
was
a
special
occasion
and
they
knew
exactly
how
to
make
him
come
out
of
the
tent
and
send
a
certain
call
ringing
across
so
that
their
friend
the
stallion
sooltan
would
come
racing
with
native
pad
and
halter
riderless
towards
them
this
is
how
they
worked
it
first
touaa
because
ladies
always
come
first
would
pull
his
coat
and
then
go
out
and
point
in
the
direction
of
the
find
growling
softly
then
give
a
short
yelp
and
give
up
her
place
to
iouaa
who
had
just
pulled
the
coat
to
come
and
point
and
yelp
whilst
she
returned
to
pull
the
coat
it
sounds
complicated
but
it
really
as
simple
as
simple
and
had
never
been
known
to
fail
of
course
he
would
throw
something
at
them
and
tell
them
he
was
coming
because
he
was
sick
to
death
of
them
and
their
silly
ways
but
they
knew
better
he
was
really
just
as
keen
as
themselves
besides
he
belonged
to
the
desert
and
tonight
they
would
take
him
first
along
the
path
where
they
had
chased
their
own
shadows
and
show
him
the
very
spot
where
they
had
stopped
and
crouched
belly
to
ground
as
the
wind
had
brought
a
most
unusual
scent
to
their
keen
noses
then
they
would
take
him
further
along
the
path
and
show
him
how
fast
they
had
gone
by
the
marks
of
their
pads
in
the
sand
and
then
and
then
they
would
show
him
the
scene
of
the
great
and
glorious
fight
why
the
field
of
battle
stretched
for
yards
and
yards
and
yards
and
they
could
show
him
the
marks
where
the
wounded
lioness
had
lashed
with
her
tail
in
rage
and
the
very
place
where
they
had
taken
off
as
they
leapt
upon
her
and
he
would
really
have
to
take
care
where
he
walked
because
the
place
was
in
a
really
terrible
state
and
he
would
have
to
keep
his
hand
on
the
halter
because
horses
even
stallions
were
most
foolishly
upset
at
the
scent
of
lion
there
was
the
spot
where
touaa
had
rolled
after
her
side
had
been
ripped
and
the
place
from
which
iouaa
had
leapt
to
fasten
his
fangs
in
the
lioness
muzzle
from
which
she
had
dislodged
him
by
rolling
on
her
back
and
ripping
his
chest
and
throat
with
the
claws
of
her
back
paws
which
somehow
had
savoured
of
hitting
below
the
belt
then
they
would
show
him
the
place
where
the
great
tawny
beast
lay
dead
she
was
quite
dead
you
could
go
and
touch
her
they
had
seen
to
that
and
you
could
see
by
the
state
of
the
sand
how
she
had
beaten
off
attack
after
attack
and
they
had
leapt
again
and
again
to
pull
her
down
until
the
great
fangs
had
met
in
the
side
of
her
neck
and
worried
and
gripped
until
the
end
whose
fangs
oh
well
of
course
ladies
have
to
come
first
and
they
raced
across
the
desert
as
the
dawn
broke
to
tell
him
of
the
great
victory
they
had
won
for
him
and
then
within
twenty
yards
of
the
tent
they
stopped
dead
threw
up
their
fine
heads
eyes
red
and
glaring
ruffs
standing
and
sniffed
the
mingled
scents
which
came
to
them
on
the
wind
they
sniffed
the
ground
at
their
feet
and
growled
and
belly
to
the
ground
crept
a
few
yards
to
their
right
the
lioness
had
passed
that
way
would
their
great
victory
he
not
such
a
big
surprise
for
him
after
all
had
he
seen
the
beast
already
and
that
other
scent
a
mixed
scent
of
humans
the
humans
that
were
not
of
the
desert
humans
meant
noise
where
were
they
why
was
there
such
a
strange
feeling
such
a
strange
quietness
about
the
place
did
he
sleep
so
soundly
that
he
did
not
hear
and
whistle
them
they
stood
quite
still
still
as
though
carved
out
of
stone
looking
at
the
light
which
showed
dim
in
the
coming
dawn
and
which
when
they
hunted
across
the
desert
had
always
been
to
them
as
a
beacon
of
happiness
then
they
growled
the
deep
unforgiving
growl
of
hate
somebody
was
standing
looking
at
them
from
inside
the
tent
and
that
somebody
was
not
him
nor
in
any
way
like
him
their
great
faithful
hearts
leapt
in
a
strange
fear
for
their
master
and
the
hair
on
their
backs
rose
stiff
and
straight
as
they
moved
slowly
forward
side
by
side
up
to
the
entrance
they
went
growling
softly
all
the
while
then
with
barks
and
yelps
of
joy
they
leapt
inside
they
had
seen
him
asleep
their
hearts
were
at
rest
how
could
he
hear
or
whistle
them
if
he
lay
asleep
one
on
each
side
tails
wagging
eyes
gleaming
they
stood
with
upon
the
couch
and
bent
to
sniff
him
who
was
so
dear
to
them
so
they
stood
for
just
one
uncomprehending
moment
then
dropped
to
the
ground
shivering
as
touaa
gave
a
little
whine
then
they
walked
slowly
round
the
couch
whining
and
sniffing
as
they
went
and
touaa
stayed
a
moment
to
lick
the
hand
which
had
so
often
pulled
her
silky
ears
and
iouaa
rose
for
an
instant
upon
his
and
scratched
at
his
master
boot
as
he
had
so
often
done
when
impatient
to
be
up
and
away
across
the
desert
then
side
by
side
they
crossed
to
where
the
man
stood
watching
with
nails
driven
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
tears
in
his
sorrowing
eyes
touaa
wagged
her
tail
once
iouaa
drove
his
head
fiercely
against
the
clenched
hand
it
was
their
only
way
of
asking
what
had
happened
to
make
him
sleep
so
very
soundly
and
ben
kelham
bent
down
and
putting
his
hand
under
their
mighty
jaws
lifted
their
heads
so
that
their
sorrowful
eyes
looked
into
his
and
slowly
shook
his
head
and
they
turned
and
walked
close
against
each
other
to
the
outside
of
the
tent
and
there
they
sat
upon
their
haunches
and
lifted
their
heads
and
howled
three
times
the
despairing
cry
the
last
post
of
the
faithful
friends
rang
out
across
the
plain
then
they
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
close
together
and
separating
at
the
foot
went
up
to
the
head
of
the
couch
and
sat
down
upon
their
haunches
one
on
each
side
of
him
immovable
as
though
carved
by
grief
out
of
stone
ben
kelham
with
the
one
thought
of
shutting
the
tragic
picture
if
only
for
a
moment
from
his
eyes
of
hiding
his
grief
if
only
from
the
great
dogs
blindly
pulled
back
the
curtain
and
stumbled
into
the
silent
room
of
prayer
lit
by
a
silver
lamp
he
stood
staring
down
at
the
water
with
which
his
friend
had
so
lately
prepared
himself
for
the
hour
of
prayer
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
white
handkerchief
he
had
evidently
dropped
and
he
stood
and
stared
and
stared
as
he
turned
the
little
square
over
and
over
in
his
hand
it
was
wringing
wet
it
smelt
faintly
of
the
perfume
the
girl
he
loved
had
always
used
it
had
her
initials
woven
in
one
corner
my
god
he
whispered
as
he
looked
round
the
little
room
then
crossed
to
the
spot
near
the
curtain
where
the
sand
had
been
disturbed
and
then
followed
the
prints
of
small
feet
across
the
floor
to
the
further
side
my
god
he
repeated
i
understand
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
at
the
curtain
which
divided
him
from
his
friend
carden
old
fellow
i
understand
what
you
gave
your
life
to
make
me
understand
and
his
heart
beat
with
a
great
love
and
a
greater
gratitude
as
he
parted
the
curtain
and
went
out
into
the
desert
he
did
not
once
turn
to
look
back
else
might
he
have
seen
a
speck
on
the
horizon
moving
at
the
incredible
speed
with
which
a
camel
can
race
as
it
slithers
across
the
sands
chapter
xxxiv
in
rama
was
there
a
voice
heard
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
and
would
not
be
comforted
because
they
were
not
matthew
ii
hugh
as
she
called
to
her
son
from
her
high
seat
upon
the
camel
the
woman
was
the
only
living
thing
to
be
seen
in
the
desert
in
her
simplicity
her
colouring
her
solitude
she
was
biblical
she
might
have
been
a
woman
of
the
old
testament
asking
for
succour
or
sanctuary
at
the
tent
of
abraham
pitched
between
and

she
might
have
been
a
woman
fleeing
from
the
wrath
of
moses
who
gave
unto
sin
its
strength
when
out
of
sheer
solicitude
for
the
of
the
masses
he
made
laws
about
things
to
which
in
the
innocence
of
their
hearts
they
had
up
till

never
given
two
thoughts
leave
that
corner
piece
of

unhedged

on
that
not

soul
will
tramp

tramp

up

if
you
do
find

across

yes
the
picture
was
biblical
rebecca
must
have
worn
exactly
the

as

become

such
a

across
just
such
a
desert
we
change
our
fashions
our
fixed
opinions
the
colour
of
our
hair
and
the
pattern
of
our
socks
when
the
fancy
seizes
us
but
neither

has
changed

so
far

heaven
for
it
there
is
still
one
place
left
in
which
we
can
go
to

solitude
the
grief
of
rachel
was
shadowed
upon
the
face
of
jill
the
wife
of
the
arab
as
she
sat
quite
still
looking
down
at
the
pool
of
orange
light
flung
from
the
tent
out
onto
the
sand
then
she
sighed
the
little
sigh
of
the
anxious
heart
which
like
the
wind
that
springs
up
and
sweeps
over
your
dwelling
and
is
gone
heralding
the
storm
is
the
forerunner
of
the
grief
which
will
ere
long
overwhelm
you
she

the
lover
the
wife
the
brother
the
friend
can
temporarily
blind
themselves
with
the
blinkers
of
false
hope
and
can
blunt
the
stabbing
spear
of
hideous
fear
with
reasoning
but
the
never
you
can
not
deceive
her
with
a
smile
nor
can
distance
hide
your
distress
from
her
you
can
not
if
you
could
be
so
minded
conceal
your
joy
from
her
nor
can
you
hurt
her
with
a
wound
that
will
not

to
her
with
your
hands
swelling
from
the
sting
of
the
wasp
you
found
in
the
stolen
fruit
or
stained
with
crime
or
your
shoes
wet
through
with
the
mire
of
the
in
which
you
have
been
straying
and
what
will
she
do
she
will
sit
you
down
in

of
the
glowing
fire
of
her
love
warm
your
straying
feet
wash
away
the
stain
in
the
bitter
waters
of
her
tears
and
then
dry
them
with
her
smile
and
you
can
go
on
straying
if
you
could
be
so
minded
until
seven
million
and
you
will
find
her
just
the
same
it
is
not
forgiveness
it
is
love
and
it
was
love
which
when
there
came
no
answer
to
her
call
urged
jill
to
get
her
camel
to
its
knees
over
twenty
years
had
passed
since
jill
carden
the
english
girl
had
first
tried
her
hand
upon
the
obstreperous
camel
she
had
ridden
out
into
the
desert
under
the
stars
with
her
desert
lover
she
had
strong
in
a
great
love
fearlessly
climbed
the
high
wall
of
racial
distinction
crowned
with
the
spikes
of
custom
and
convention
she
had
watched
the
seed
of
happiness
burst
and
blossom
until
it
had
grown
into
a
great
tree
but
she
had
forgotten
that
no
tree
however
deep
its
roots
however
strong
its
branches
is
safe
so
long
as
fate
in
senile
jealousy
can
tear
the
heavens
into
ribbons
with
her
hellish
lightning
the
camel
lurching
and
groaning
staggering
and
heaving
got
to
its
knees
in
just
the
same
way
as
taffadaln
had
done
over
twenty
years
ago
just
as
the
camel
will
do
twenty
centuries
hence
if
it
has
not
become
extinct
through
some
button
or
wire
or
wave
or
ray
which
will
have
turned
the
desert
into
a
kind
of
international
piazza
into
the
middle
of
which
for
our
coffee
and
cigarette
we
shall
be
conveyed
in
a
few
moments
by
means
of
something
wireless
for
so
much
cash
down
in
advance
which
will
include
the
tip
to
the
bedouin
waiter
one
can
see
empires
and
deserts
disappearing
but
the
tipping
system
never
and
as
wellington
would
not
let
go
of
the
book
his
mistress
had
left
him
as
guarantee
of
her
return
so
as
to
grip
the
back
of
the
seat
in
his
powerful
jaw
he
came
nigh
to
being
strangled
as
he
lurched
and
swung
and
bumped
as
the
camel
got
to
its
knees
which
seemed
to
be
legion
as
it
tucked
its
legs
under
and
untucked
them
and
did
it
all
over
again
with
vociferous
lamentations
until
it
had
got
them
all
neatly
folded
up
and
once
standing
upon
the
sand
he
wrinkled
his
nose
in
disgust
and
removed
himself
some
yards
from
the
odour
of
this
unpleasant
complaining
brute
which
hailed
undoubtedly
from
the
bazaar
and
gave
disgusting
and
crude
imitations
in
its
throat
of
water
being
poured
out
of
a
bottle
he
wanted
his
mistress
and
her
only
so
having
no
use
for
or
interest
in
this
woman
who
had
brought
him
for
no
apparent
reason
upon
such
an
uncomfortable
journey
he
simply
took
matters
into
his
own
big
head
and
without
a
with
or
by
your
leave
waddled
off
book
in
slobbering
mouth
to
look
for
his
beloved
whom
his
olfactory
powers
not
being
of
the
keenest
he
felt
to
be
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
perhaps
playing
at
behind
the
tents
as
she
did
on
wet
mornings
at
home
behind
the
chesterfield
jill
dismounted
and
stood
facing
the
desert
which
seemed
to
stretch
as
one
vast
purple
pall
and
as
she
stood
she
wrestled
with
a
mighty
fear
which
held
her
so
that
she
could
not
turn
and
go
towards
the
tent
through
which
shone
the
orange
light
she
did
not
say
to
herself
that
her
son
had
gone
out
with
his
horses
and
his
dogs
she
did
not
try
to
trick
herself
with
the
thought
that
perhaps
he
slept
in
his
purple
tent
and
for
that
reason
had
not
rushed
out
across
the
desert
to
meet
and
lift
her
from
the
camel
she
knew
that
she
had
only
to
turn
and
walk
the
few
yards
to
the
tent
to
have
all
her
questions
answered
but
she
also
knew
that
all
she
wanted
to
do
was
to
stand
on
and
on
and
on
just
as
she
was
with
her
face
towards
the
night
and
her
back
to
the
dawn
of
another
day
and
definite
knowledge
she
loved
her
other
sons
deeply
and
dearly
she
loved
her
little
daughter
but
her
held
equal
place
in
her
heart
with
the
arab
his
father
and
her
love
for
him
was
beyond
words
and
almost
too
great
and
too
holy
a
thing
to
be
written
about
here
tears
and
laughter
the
moon
and
the
stars
the
mystery
of
the
sphinx
and
the
desert
at
dawn
at
noon
at
night
bound
them
both
to
her
heart
with
golden
chains
of
a
surpassing
love
she
had
said
no
word
of
what
she
had
suffered
in
all
these
years
he
had
been
gone
from
her
she
could
not
have
told
you
an
she
would
of
her
joy
at
the
thought
of
his
at
last
and
she
lifted
up
her
hands
and
cried
aloud
he
is
my
son
he
is
my
son
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
to
the
tent
she
made
no
sound
she
gave
no
cry
she
just
stretched
wide
her
arms
in
stricken
motherhood
as
the
great
dogs
sat
immovable
at
their
head
like
images
of
grief
carved
out
of
stone
the
cloak
slid
from
her
shoulders
and
fell
about
her
feet
as
she
crossed
to
the
foot
of
the
couch
with
arms
where
she
stood
such
a
slender
and
beautiful
mother
looking
down
and
her
silken
veils
filled
the
air
with
a
gentle
whispering
as
she
moved
to
his
head
such
a
desolate
mother
looking
down
at
the
little
crimson
mark
which
showed
like
a
rose
above
the
heart
hugh
she
whispered
as
she
touched
the
long
lashes
which
hid
the
eyes
which
had
always
been
so
full
of
tender
love
for
her
my
son
she
whispered
as
she
stroked
his
cheek
and
with
slender
fingers
and
a
little
smile
tucked
back
the
stray
lock
of
brown
hair
which
never
would
stay
under
the
turban
she
patted
his
chest
and
arranged
the
full
skirt
of
his
satin
coat
into
folds
and
stroked
his
hand
as
mothers
do
and
she
knelt
at
his
knees
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
boots
and
smiled
a
little
nodding
her
head
just
to
let
him
know
how
wonderful
she
thought
him
she
did
not
know
she
was
doing
it
she
did
not
fully
understand
how
could
she
she
was
just
holding
back
the
door
which
was
closing
she
lifted
the
amulet
in
the
form
of
a
scarab
of
which
the
base
was
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
and
which
just
touched
the
mark
that
looked
like
a
crimson
rose
she
was
not
very
good
at
reading
inscriptions
but
she
always
tried
her
best
because
it
pleased
him
and
made
him
laugh
so
lovingly
at
her
funny
little
accent
and
to
please
him
now
she
tried
she
did
not
know
she
was
doing
it
but
there
was
not
much
more
than
a
crack
left
open
through
which
she
could
see
heart
my
mother
my
heart
my
mother
my
heart
whereby
i
came
into
and
if
great
tears
dropped
upon
his
heart
as
she
slowly
read
the
words
of
power
they
surely
made
a
very
fitting
insignia
with
which
to
enter
into
the
presence
of
allah
who
is
god
she
kissed
his
hands
and
kissed
the
closed
eyes
and
tender
mouth
which
smiled
as
he
slept
she
moved
round
the
tent
pulling
the
curtains
straight
having
promised
faithfully
to
carry
out
his
wishes
ah
how
she
had
smiled
when
she
had
given
that
promise
love
of
his
wife
and
his
children
she
had
thought
would
soon
oust
the
idea
of
death
from
his
mind
and
looked
up
at
the
lamp
to
see
if
it
was
well
filled
with
oil
and
gently
took
down
the
spear
from
the
wall
whilst
the
great
dogs
sat
immovable
as
images
of
grief
carved
out
of
stone
and
she
laid
her
hand
upon
their
heads
and
taking
the
corner
of
her
veil
wiped
the
sand
from
their
jaws
but
they
growled
softly
not
angrily
just
to
let
her
know
that
no
hand
but
that
of
their
master
must
touch
them
she
went
to
the
entrance
and
called
them
but
they
growled
just
to
let
her
know
that
they
would
answer
no
voice
but
that
of
their
master
and
that
for
the
sound
of
that
beloved
voice
they
would
wait
for
eternity
of
course
she
did
not
quite
understand
them
how
could
she
not
knowing
that
the
love
of
a
dog
surpasses
that
of
a
friend
and
equals
that
of
a
mother
so
she
lifted
the
chequered
curtains
at
the
back
just
to
let
them
know
that
there
was
a
way
out
and
looked
down
at
the
footprints
of
small
feet
and
of
heavy
feet
and
across
to
the
lifted
flap
through
which
she
could
see
the
day
dawning
and
if
her
whole
being
shook
with
anguish
as
part
of
her
question
was
answered
and
if
her
heart
was
stabbed
with
sudden
pain
at
the
thought
that
strangers
had
plucked
her
crown
of
glory
from
her
and
trampled
upon
it
and
if
she
suddenly
threw
out
her
arms
and
questioned
the
almighty
upon
the
wisdom
of
his
ways
can
we
blame
her
she
passed
through
the
lifted
flap
of
the
room
of
prayer
and
mounted
her
camel
and
rode
out
to
the
west
and
at
the
sight
of
the
woman
with
the
light
in
her
hand
the
servants
who
had
been
watching
the
tents
rushed
out
to
meet
her
and
at
the
sign
she
made
bowed
their
heads
to
the
sands
and
their
dirge
swept
across
the
desert
as
they
answered
as
she
called
thy
master
o
my
people
has
started
upon
a
long
journey
allah
receive
him
at
his
journey
end
into
his
safe
keeping
our
master
they
answered
is
absent
upon
a
long
journey
allah
guide
his
feet
into
eternal
joy
they
brought
her
two
camels
and
watched
her
depart
then
turned
to
make
all
things
ready
to
lead
their
master
horses
and
dogs
and
birds
down
to
the
river
she
rode
her
camel
some
distance
from
the
tents
of
purple
and
of
gold
and
of
death
and
hobbled
them
and
returned
on
foot
across
the
sands
which
were
gold
with
the
beams
of
the
risen
sun
she
lifted
the
lamp
in
the
tent
of
purple
and
spilled
the
oil
upon
the
floor
and
let
drop
the
wick
upon
the
oil
and
she
crossed
to
the
tent
of
gold
and
did
likewise
and
as
the
flames
shot
up
on
each
side
she
crossed
to
the
tent
of
death
and
entered
she
bent
down
over
her
son
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
laid
her
cheek
just
for
the
last
time
against
his
and
stood
for
one
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
with
arms
outstretched
in
stricken
motherhood
looking
down
then
she
turned
and
went
out
and
called
softly
to
the
dogs
who
growled
not
angrily
but
just
to
let
her
know
that
they
could
not
come
and
she
looked
at
her
son
hugh
carden
ali
with
his
two
friends
like
images
of
grief
carved
out
of
stone
to
guard
him
then
dropping
the
curtain
went
out
as
the
door
closed
and
just
as
the
flew
straight
to
the
sun
in
answer
perhaps
to
his
master
voice
she
raised
the
spear
and
drove
it
through
the
corner
of
the
tent
into
the
sand
so
as
to
let
those
who
passed
know
that
the
owner
was
absent
upon
a
long
journey

big
ben
kelham
walked
slowly
with
his
eyes
upon
the
faint
track
of
little
feet
which
had
moved
in
a
circle
and
not
once
did
he
look
behind
else
would
he
have
seen
the
smoke
of
the
burning
tents
he
moved
slowly
not
because
he
feared
or
because
he
did
not
want
to
run
but
because
he
knew
and
wanted
time
in
which
to
reason
with
himself
to
decide
if
he
had
the
right
to
take
the
joy
which
was
waiting
for
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
strong
silent
lovable
man
that
he
was
and
shook
himself
just
as
a
spaniel
does
when
it
comes
out
of
the
water
he
had
been
nigh
to
drowning
in
the
depths
and
out
of
his
pocket
to
be
lost
for
ever
had
fallen
the
jewel
of
youth
but
somehow
he
had
managed
to
scramble
to
the
bank
and
to
pull
himself
out
and
he
made
a
step
forward
and
swept
the
horizon
to
see
if
his
journey
was
at
an
end
then
hesitated
remembering
he
stood
quite
still
and
looked
at
a
slender
figure
wrapt
about
in
a
mantle
of
gold
which
stood
some
distance
off
with
hands
outstretched
toward
him
and
with
beckoning
finger
and
the
wind
with
a
laugh
lifted
the
veil
from
her
face
and
dropped
it
and
lifted
it
again
and
swept
the
mantle
so
that
it
clung
to
the
slender
supple
figure
then
spread
it
out
behind
like
gleaming
wings
she
put
one
finger
to
her
mouth
and
opened
wide
her
eyes
of
knowledge
shaded
with
the
fringe
of
tears
which
come
from
pain
and
just
as
much
from
joy
follow
me
she
whispered
and
the
south
wind
seized
upon
the
golden
tones
and
flung
them
to
the
west
wind
and
to
the
east
and
to
the
north
wind
so
that
the
message
was
carried
right
across
the
world
follow
me
i
am
hope
and
he
plunged
his
hands
still
further
into
his
pockets
and
scrunched
up
some
keys
and
small
change
and
a
most
cherished
pipe
just
out
of
gratitude
and
walked
on
he
found
her
in
fact
he
would
have
seen
her
ever
so
much
sooner
if
she
had
not
been
lying
face
down
on
the
sands
with
her
head
buried
in
her
arms
he
did
not
hasten
knowing
that
the
whole
of
his
life
stretched
before
him
in
which
to
heal
her
hurt
she
did
not
hear
him
because
he
walked
lightly
as
those
delightfully
big
men
do
and
he
stood
over
her
wondering
how
to
rouse
her
without
frightening
her
and
frowned
when
a
little
sob
shook
her
then
he
smiled
strange
is
it
how
in
the
very
middle
of
the
most
dramatic
situation
a
little
thought
will
push
open
the
lid
of
its
own
little
and
creep
out
to
touch
our
risible
nerve
it
really
ought
to
know
better
because
empires
and
marriages
and
business
contracts
have
been
upset
if
not
lost
on
account
of
its
freaky
humour
and
it
twisted
the
corners
of
the
man
mouth
into
a
distinct
smile
as
he
involuntarily
thought
of
the
drizzling
november
afternoon
when
damaris
in
brogues
tweed
skirt
and
mackintosh
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
out
to
join
in
some
demonstration
which
had
to
do
with
the
upholding
of
the
rights
of
her
and
had
only
been
dissuaded
therefrom
by
the
opportune
arrival
of
tea
and
muffins
little
damaris
just
one
of
those
women
who
creep
right
into
the
hearts
of
men
on
account
of
their
gentleness
and
apparent
helplessness
who
are
born
to
be
put
into
a
glass
cupboard
before
which
those
who
love
them
spread
themselves
like
who
rule
with
a
rod
pickled
in
their
apparent
helplessness
which
is
stronger
than
a
whip
of
steel
and
who
are
quite
closely
related
to
the
barnacle
and
mollusc
to
which
the
tide
regularly
brings
out
of
the
ocean
whilst
the
more
mercurial
eel
has
to
go
out
and
thresh
about
in
the
mud
for
what
it
requires
to
keep
it
going
in
its
fight
for
life
anyway
the
eel
has
the
advantage
of
getting
about
a
bit
then
the
smiled
faded
and
he
knelt
because
he
could
not
stand
the
sound
of
that
little
sob
any
longer
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stroked
her
hair
damaris
darling
it
i
ben
she
stiffened
under
the
shock
of
the
words
and
flung
her
hands
over
her
head
the
terrible
hour
had
come
she
would
have
out
of
very
decency
to
tell
him
everything
why
she
lay
where
he
had
so
miraculously
found
her
how
she
had
promised
herself
to
his
friend
how
she
had
she
clutched
her
bonny
curls
in
both
hands
and
pressed
herself
hard
to
the
ground
longing
that
it
should
open
and
swallow
her
up
she
could
not
get
up
she
could
not
turn
round
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
man
she
loved
with
all
the
strength
of
the
love
of
which
she
was
capable
she
could
not
watch
the
love
in
his
eyes
change
to
a
look
of
disgust
she
simply
could
not
do
it
and
then
she
felt
his
hands
on
hers
and
his
fingers
unfastening
hers
one
by
one
from
her
grasp
upon
her
curls
and
she
lay
quite
still
with
a
lovely
warm
feeling
creeping
over
and
through
her
because
she
knew
by
the
gentleness
of
the
touch
and
the
firmness
of
it
that
she
would
be
gathered
up
safely
into
his
arms
and
carried
away
to
happiness
and
just
as
she
had
thought
he
would
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
lifted
her
like
a
feather
and
crushed
her
up
against
his
heart
and
got
to
his
feet
and
lifted
his
head
to
the
glory
of
the
sky
but
she
would
not
look
up
she
could
not
because
she
had
taken
the
jewel
of
her
youth
and
flung
it
carelessly
far
from
her
so
that
she
lay
as
a
woman
in
his
arms
and
a
woman
who
had
looked
deep
in
the
passing
of
a
few
hours
into
the
heart
of
those
things
which
have
to
do
with
love
the
wind
whispered
in
her
ear
as
it
carelessly
touched
her
face
and
it
whispered
in
a
voice
out
of
the
past
and
this
is
what
it
whispered
for
love
will
have
come
to
her
maybe
for
a
day
maybe
for
a
second
of
time
but
a
love
which
will
mingle
her
soul
with
the
soul
of
her
desert
lover
yet
it
is
the
love
of
the
soul
that
endureth
for
ever
yea
even
if
the
body
of
the
woman
passeth
into
keeping
and
ben
kelham
feeling
her
shiver
and
thinking
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
that
she
was
cold
and
hungry
tucked
the
satin
cloak
with
sable
collar
still
closer
round
her
then
looked
across
to
the
east
where
lay
a
pall
of
smoke
upon
the
air
i
am
taking
you
back
damaris
my
little
love
he
spoke
slowly
with
his
eyes
on
the
burning
tents
the
significance
of
which
had
sunk
deep
into
his
heart
wo
you
look
up
wo
you
just
say
that
you
will
marry
me
so
that
i
can
tell
everyone
directly
we
get
back
he
put
her
on
her
feet
when
she
suddenly
struggled
and
pushed
against
him
and
stared
aghast
when
she
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
damaris
dear
what
is
it
do
you
want
to
marry
me
damaris
nodded
her
lovely
head
which
glistened
like
a
hall
of
silk
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
you
do
you
will
then
what
are
you
crying
for
oh
damaris
the
words
came
muffled
as
she
shook
with
sobs
because
of
the
scandal
ben
because
of
what
people
will
say
about
me
i
mean
about
me
when
they
know
i
am
engaged
to
to
you
they
will
laugh
at
you
behind
your
back
they
will
they
will
know
about
about
he
pulled
her
to
him
quite
roughly
and
pressed
her
head
against
his
shoulder
which
it
barely
reached
laugh
he
said
laugh
at
me
or
you
i
should
just
like
to
hear
them
darling
there
is
a
way
out
of
all
this
sweetheart
somewhere
and
i
am
going
to
find
it
and
all
that
has
happened
beloved
rests
on
my
shoulders
and
heaven
knows
they
are
broad
enough
to
bear
it
and
if
we
have
hurt
others
darling
and
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
the
tents
it
has
been
through
my
carelessness
and
we
shall
be
shown
a
way
in
which
to
try
and
make
amends
laugh
dear
let
them
laugh
dear
heart
when
they
see
how
we
love
each
other
but
for
all
that
he
frowned
above
her
curly
head
because
he
had
all
the
englishman
horror
of
scandal
in
connection
with
any
of
his
but
he
set
his
teeth
and
crushed
her
up
closer
then
let
her
go
suddenly
and
swung
her
round
pointing
across
to
the
west
look
darling
look
and
the
tears
streamed
down
the
girl
face
as
she
flung
out
her
arms
she
called
her
voice
carried
on
the
still
air
like
the
note
of
a
bell
over
water
and
the
stallion
who
had
broken
from
his
as
he
was
being
led
from
the
stable
in
readiness
for
the
sad
procession
to
the
river
and
who
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
burning
tents
had
rushed
on
in
search
of
his
master
stopped
dead
with
his
head
up
and
tail
and
mane
streaming
in
the
wind
he
had
not
found
his
master
but
he
knew
the
voice
that
called
it
came
again
and
he
reared
and
wheeled
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
came
then
raced
to
where
he
saw
the
girl
standing
he
stamped
and
whinnied
and
nuzzled
her
hand
and
her
shoulder
as
she
stood
in
her
lover
arms
tell
me
you
will
marry
me
sweetheart
ben
kelham
was
saying
with
one
hand
on
the
stallion
bridle
say
it
damaris
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
up
piteously
with
tears
in
her
wonderful
eyes
as
she
made
a
great
sacrifice
to
her
honour
i
ca
ben
she
whispered
i
i
oh
i
ca
tell
you
i
have
the
courage
oh
ben
you
would
never
understand
he
gave
a
great
shout
as
he
leapt
to
the
saddle
and
took
the
stallion
back
a
hundred
yards
then
wheeled
him
and
raced
him
back
along
his
tracks
understand
beloved
he
cried
as
he
bent
as
he
rushed
past
her
at
full
speed
and
lifted
her
to
the
saddle
there
is
nothing
to
understand
and
he
turned
the
stallion
as
he
spoke
and
headed
him
towards
the
tents
we
will
just
go
back
dear
we
will
just
pass
to
say
goodbye
together
and
they
swept
across
the
desert
then
he
reined
in
the
stallion
and
sat
staring
then
whispered
as
he
bent
and
kissed
the
bonny
curls
the
way
out
dear
the
way
out
someone
is
waiting
for
us
stubbornly
heavily
across
the
desert
with
occasional
pauses
for
rest
and
investigation
of
the
track
of
small
footprints
and
the
horizon
came
wellington
he
was
very
hot
and
very
thirsty
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
walking
for
many
days
through
many
many
endless
deserts
but
he
intended
to
the
sahara
or
any
other
desert
through
all
eternity
until
he
could
deliver
the
book
he
held
between
his
formidable
teeth
to
his
beloved
mistress
and
she
slid
from
the
saddle
and
knelt
and
put
her
arms
around
him
and
took
the
somewhat
moist
keepsake
from
him
she
swung
up
like
a
bird
into
her
lover
arms
and
took
the
reins
whilst
he
leant
right
down
to
lift
the
dog
but
wellington
great
heart
was
troubled
he
looked
up
at
his
mistress
and
said
as
plainly
as
could
be
with
reproachful
eyes
two
company
and
turned
to
walk
stubbornly
and
heavily
back
across
those
many
many
deserts
to
the
tents
ben
kelham
cheered
him
on
as
they
thundered
past
him
we
wait
for
you
old
fellow
he
cried
then
looked
down
on
the
woman
he
loved
her
hands
were
clasped
upon
the
silken
bodice
where
she
had
pinned
the
brooch
which
had
been
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
the
hawk
of
egypt
it
was
not
there
it
had
come
unfastened
as
she
lay
in
her
grief
she
had
left
it
to
be
buried
so
deep
just
a
few
days
later
when
the
greatest
storm
which
had
ever
been
known
to
sweep
the
desert
piled
the
sand
the
desert
own
cloak
to
the
height
of
hills
under
which
slumbered
all
those
who
had
sought
peace
at
her
breast
under
which
guarded
throughout
all
ages
by
his
dogs
peacefully
slept
her
son
ben
she
cried
opening
wide
her
eyes
in
which
shone
love
and
tears
ben
can
you
ever
ever
forgive
me
and
he
bent
and
kissed
her
as
he
replied
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
beloved
of
my
heart
i
love
you
