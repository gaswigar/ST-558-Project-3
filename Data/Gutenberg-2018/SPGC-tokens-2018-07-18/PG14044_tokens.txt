the
angels
of
mons
the
bowmen
and
other
legends
of
the
war
by
arthur
machen
introduction
i
have
been
asked
to
write
an
introduction
to
the
story
of
the
bowmen
on
its
publication
in
book
form
together
with
three
other
tales
of
similar
fashion
and
i
hesitate
this
affair
of
the
bowmen
has
been
such
an
odd
one
from
first
to
last
so
many
queer
complications
have
entered
into
it
there
have
been
so
many
and
so
divers
currents
and
of
rumour
and
speculation
concerning
it
that
i
honestly
do
not
know
where
to
begin
i
propose
then
to
solve
the
difficulty
by
apologising
for
beginning
at
all
for
usually
and
fitly
the
presence
of
an
introduction
is
held
to
imply
that
there
is
something
of
consequence
and
importance
to
be
introduced
if
for
example
a
man
has
made
an
anthology
of
great
poetry
he
may
well
write
an
introduction
justifying
his
principle
of
selection
pointing
out
here
and
there
as
the
spirit
moves
him
high
beauties
and
supreme
excellencies
discoursing
of
the
magnates
and
lords
and
princes
of
literature
whom
he
is
merely
serving
as
groom
of
the
chamber
introductions
that
is
belong
to
the
masterpieces
and
classics
of
the
world
to
the
great
and
ancient
and
accepted
things
and
i
am
here
introducing
a
short
small
story
of
my
own
which
appeared
in
evening
about
ten
months
ago
i
appreciate
the
absurdity
nay
the
enormity
of
the
position
in
all
its
grossness
and
my
excuse
for
these
pages
must
be
this
that
though
the
story
itself
is
nothing
it
has
yet
had
such
odd
and
unforeseen
consequences
and
adventures
that
the
tale
of
them
may
possess
some
interest
and
then
again
there
are
certain
psychological
morals
to
be
drawn
from
the
whole
matter
of
the
tale
and
its
sequel
of
rumours
and
discussions
that
are
not
i
think
devoid
of
consequence
and
so
to
begin
at
the
beginning
this
was
in
last
august
to
be
more
precise
on
the
last
sunday
of
last
august
there
were
terrible
things
to
be
read
on
that
hot
sunday
morning
between
meat
and
mass
it
was
in
weekly
that
i
saw
the
awful
account
of
the
retreat
from
mons
i
no
longer
recollect
the
details
but
i
have
not
forgotten
the
impression
that
was
then
on
my
mind
i
seemed
to
see
a
furnace
of
torment
and
death
and
agony
and
terror
seven
times
heated
and
in
the
midst
of
the
burning
was
the
british
army
in
the
midst
of
the
flame
consumed
by
it
and
yet
aureoled
in
it
scattered
like
ashes
and
yet
triumphant
martyred
and
for
ever
glorious
so
i
saw
our
men
with
a
shining
about
them
so
i
took
these
thoughts
with
me
to
church
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
making
up
a
story
in
my
head
while
the
deacon
was
singing
the
gospel
this
was
not
the
tale
of
the
bowmen
it
was
the
first
sketch
as
it
were
of
the
soldiers
rest
i
only
wish
i
had
been
able
to
write
it
as
i
conceived
it
the
tale
as
it
stands
is
i
think
a
far
better
piece
of
craft
than
the
bowmen
but
the
tale
that
came
to
me
as
the
blue
incense
floated
above
the
gospel
book
on
the
desk
between
the
tapers
that
indeed
was
a
noble
story
like
all
the
stories
that
never
get
written
i
conceived
the
dead
men
coming
up
through
the
flames
and
in
the
flames
and
being
welcomed
in
the
eternal
tavern
with
songs
and
flowing
cups
and
everlasting
mirth
but
every
man
is
the
child
of
his
age
however
much
he
may
hate
it
and
our
popular
religion
has
long
determined
that
jollity
is
wicked
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
modern
protestantism
believes
that
heaven
is
something
like
evensong
in
an
english
cathedral
the
service
by
stainer
and
the
dean
preaching
for
those
opposed
to
dogma
of
any
kind
even
the
mildest
i
suppose
it
is
held
that
a
course
of
ethical
lectures
will
be
arranged
well
i
have
long
maintained
that
on
the
whole
the
average
church
considered
as
a
house
of
preaching
is
a
much
more
poisonous
place
than
the
average
tavern
still
as
i
say
one
age
masters
one
and
clouds
and
bewilders
the
intelligence
and
the
real
story
of
the
soldiers
rest
with
its
sonus
epulantium
in
æterno
convivio
was
ruined
at
the
moment
of
its
birth
and
it
was
some
time
later
that
the
actual
story
got
written
and
in
the
meantime
the
plot
of
the
bowmen
occurred
to
me
now
it
has
been
murmured
and
hinted
and
suggested
and
whispered
in
all
sorts
of
quarters
that
before
i
wrote
the
tale
i
had
heard
something
the
most
decorative
of
these
legends
is
also
the
most
precise
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
whole
thing
was
given
him
in
typescript
by
a
this
was
not
the
case
and
all
vaguer
reports
to
the
effect
that
i
had
heard
some
rumours
or
hints
of
rumours
are
equally
void
of
any
trace
of
truth
again
i
apologise
for
entering
so
pompously
into
the
minutiæ
of
my
bit
of
a
story
as
if
it
were
the
lost
poems
of
sappho
but
it
appears
that
the
subject
interests
the
public
and
i
comply
with
my
instructions
i
take
it
then
that
the
origins
of
the
bowmen
were
composite
first
of
all
all
ages
and
nations
have
cherished
the
thought
that
spiritual
hosts
may
come
to
the
help
of
earthly
arms
that
gods
and
heroes
and
saints
have
descended
from
their
high
immortal
places
to
fight
for
their
worshippers
and
clients
then
kipling
story
of
the
ghostly
indian
regiment
got
in
my
head
and
got
mixed
with
the
mediævalism
that
is
always
there
and
so
the
bowmen
was
written
i
was
heartily
disappointed
with
it
i
remember
and
thought
it
as
i
still
think
it
an
indifferent
piece
of
work
however
i
have
tried
to
write
for
these
long
years
and
if
i
have
not
become
practised
in
letters
i
am
at
least
a
past
master
in
the
lodge
of
disappointment
such
as
it
was
the
bowmen
appeared
in
evening
of
september
now
the
journalist
does
not
as
a
rule
dwell
much
on
the
prospect
of
fame
and
if
he
be
an
evening
journalist
his
anticipations
of
immortality
are
bounded
by
twelve
at
night
at
the
latest
and
it
may
well
be
that
those
insects
which
begin
to
live
in
the
morning
and
are
dead
by
sunset
deem
themselves
immortal
having
written
my
story
having
groaned
and
growled
over
it
and
printed
it
i
certainly
never
thought
to
hear
another
word
of
it
my
colleague
the
londoner
praised
it
warmly
to
my
face
as
his
kindly
fashion
is
entering
very
properly
a
technical
caveat
as
to
the
language
of
the
of
the
bowmen
why
should
english
archers
use
french
terms
he
said
i
replied
that
the
only
reason
was
this
that
a
monseigneur
here
and
there
struck
me
as
picturesque
and
i
reminded
him
that
as
a
matter
of
cold
historical
fact
most
of
the
archers
of
agincourt
were
mercenaries
from
gwent
my
native
country
who
would
appeal
to
mihangel
and
to
saints
not
known
to
the
saxons
teilo
iltyd
dewi
cadwaladyr
vendigeid
and
i
thought
that
that
was
the
first
and
last
discussion
of
the
bowmen
but
in
a
few
days
from
its
publication
the
editor
of
occult
wrote
to
me
he
wanted
to
know
whether
the
story
had
any
foundation
in
fact
i
told
him
that
it
had
no
foundation
in
fact
of
any
kind
or
sort
i
forget
whether
i
added
that
it
had
no
foundation
in
rumour
but
i
should
think
not
since
to
the
best
of
my
belief
there
were
no
rumours
of
heavenly
interposition
in
existence
at
that
time
certainly
i
had
heard
of
none
soon
afterwards
the
editor
of
wrote
asking
a
like
question
and
i
made
him
a
like
reply
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
stifled
any
bowmen
mythos
in
the
hour
of
its
birth
a
month
or
two
later
i
received
several
requests
from
editors
of
parish
magazines
to
reprint
the
story
i
or
rather
my
editor
readily
gave
permission
and
then
after
another
month
or
two
the
conductor
of
one
of
these
magazines
wrote
to
me
saying
that
the
february
issue
containing
the
story
had
been
sold
out
while
there
was
still
a
great
demand
for
it
would
i
allow
them
to
reprint
the
bowmen
as
a
pamphlet
and
would
i
write
a
short
preface
giving
the
exact
authorities
for
the
story
i
replied
that
they
might
reprint
in
pamphlet
form
with
all
my
heart
but
that
i
could
not
give
my
authorities
since
i
had
none
the
tale
being
pure
invention
the
priest
wrote
again
suggesting
to
my
amazement
that
i
must
be
mistaken
that
the
main
facts
of
the
bowmen
must
be
true
that
my
share
in
the
matter
must
surely
have
been
confined
to
the
elaboration
and
decoration
of
a
veridical
history
it
seemed
that
my
light
fiction
had
been
accepted
by
the
congregation
of
this
particular
church
as
the
solidest
of
facts
and
it
was
then
that
it
began
to
dawn
on
me
that
if
i
had
failed
in
the
art
of
letters
i
had
succeeded
unwittingly
in
the
art
of
deceit
this
happened
i
should
think
some
time
in
april
and
the
snowball
of
rumour
that
was
then
set
rolling
has
been
rolling
ever
since
growing
bigger
and
bigger
till
it
is
now
swollen
to
a
monstrous
size
it
was
at
about
this
period
that
variants
of
my
tale
began
to
be
told
as
authentic
histories
at
first
these
tales
betrayed
their
relation
to
their
original
in
several
of
them
the
vegetarian
restaurant
appeared
and
george
was
the
chief
character
in
one
case
an
officer
name
and
address
missing
said
that
there
was
a
portrait
of
george
in
a
certain
london
restaurant
and
that
a
figure
just
like
the
portrait
appeared
to
him
on
the
battlefield
and
was
invoked
by
him
with
the
happiest
results
another
variant
this
i
think
never
got
into
print
told
how
dead
prussians
had
been
found
on
the
battlefield
with
arrow
wounds
in
their
bodies
this
notion
amused
me
as
i
had
imagined
a
scene
when
i
was
thinking
out
the
story
in
which
a
german
general
was
to
appear
before
the
kaiser
to
explain
his
failure
to
annihilate
the
english
the
general
was
to
say
it
is
true
it
is
impossible
to
deny
it
the
men
were
killed
by
arrows
the
shafts
were
found
in
their
bodies
by
the
burying
parties
i
rejected
the
idea
as
even
for
a
mere
fantasy
i
was
therefore
entertained
when
i
found
that
what
i
had
refused
as
too
fantastical
for
fantasy
was
accepted
in
certain
occult
circles
as
hard
fact
other
versions
of
the
story
appeared
in
which
a
cloud
interposed
between
the
attacking
germans
and
the
defending
british
in
some
examples
the
cloud
served
to
conceal
our
men
from
the
advancing
enemy
in
others
it
disclosed
shining
shapes
which
frightened
the
horses
of
the
pursuing
german
cavalry
george
it
will
he
noted
has
disappeared
he
persisted
some
time
longer
in
certain
roman
catholic
variants
and
there
are
no
more
bowmen
no
more
arrows
but
so
far
angels
are
not
mentioned
yet
they
are
ready
to
appear
and
i
think
that
i
have
detected
the
machine
which
brought
them
into
the
story
in
the
bowmen
my
imagined
soldier
saw
a
long
line
of
shapes
with
a
shining
about
them
and
sinnett
writing
in
the
may
issue
of
occult
reporting
what
he
had
heard
states
that
those
who
could
see
said
they
saw
row
of
shining
beings
between
the
two
armies
now
i
conjecture
that
the
word
shining
is
the
link
between
my
tale
and
the
derivative
from
it
in
the
popular
view
shining
and
benevolent
supernatural
beings
are
angels
and
so
i
believe
the
bowmen
of
my
story
have
become
the
angels
of
mons
in
this
shape
they
have
been
received
with
respect
and
credence
everywhere
or
almost
everywhere
and
here
i
conjecture
we
have
the
key
to
the
large
popularity
of
the
delusion
as
i
think
it
we
have
long
ceased
in
england
to
take
much
interest
in
saints
and
in
the
recent
revival
of
the
cultus
of
george
the
saint
is
little
more
than
a
patriotic
figurehead
and
the
appeal
to
the
saints
to
succour
us
is
certainly
not
a
common
english
practice
it
is
held
popish
by
most
of
our
countrymen
but
angels
with
certain
reservations
have
retained
their
popularity
and
so
when
it
was
settled
that
the
english
army
in
its
dire
peril
was
delivered
by
angelic
aid
the
way
was
clear
for
general
belief
and
for
the
enthusiasms
of
the
religion
of
the
man
in
the
street
and
so
soon
as
the
legend
got
the
title
the
angels
of
mons
it
became
impossible
to
avoid
it
it
permeated
the
press
it
would
not
be
neglected
it
appeared
in
the
most
unlikely
quarters
in
and
new
church
swedenborgian
and
the
editor
of
church
has
exercised
a
wise
reserve
he
awaits
that
evidence
which
so
far
is
lacking
but
in
one
issue
of
the
paper
i
noted
that
the
story
furnished
a
text
for
a
sermon
the
subject
of
a
letter
and
the
matter
for
an
article
people
send
me
cuttings
from
provincial
papers
containing
hot
controversy
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
appearances
the
office
window
of
daily
suggests
scientific
explanations
of
the
hallucination
the
in
a
note
about
james
says
he
is
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
bowmen
of
mons
this
reversion
to
the
bowmen
from
the
angels
being
possibly
due
to
the
strong
statements
that
i
have
made
on
the
matter
the
pulpits
both
of
the
church
and
of
have
been
busy
bishop
welldon
dean
hensley
henson
a
disbeliever
bishop
taylor
smith
the
and
many
other
clergy
have
occupied
themselves
with
the
matter
horton
preached
about
the
angels
at
manchester
sir
joseph
compton
rickett
president
of
the
national
federation
of
free
church
councils
stated
that
the
soldiers
at
the
front
had
seen
visions
and
dreamed
dreams
and
had
given
testimony
of
powers
and
principalities
fighting
for
them
or
against
them
letters
come
from
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
the
editor
of
evening
with
theories
beliefs
explanations
suggestions
it
is
all
somewhat
wonderful
one
can
say
that
the
whole
affair
is
a
psychological
phenomenon
of
considerable
interest
fairly
comparable
with
the
great
russian
delusion
of
last
august
and
september
now
it
is
possible
that
some
persons
judging
by
the
tone
of
these
remarks
of
mine
may
gather
the
impression
that
i
am
a
profound
disbeliever
in
the
possibility
of
any
intervention
of
the
order
in
the
affairs
of
the
physical
order
they
will
be
mistaken
if
they
make
this
inference
they
will
be
mistaken
if
they
suppose
that
i
think
miracles
in
judæa
credible
but
miracles
in
france
or
flanders
incredible
i
hold
no
such
absurdities
but
i
confess
very
frankly
that
i
credit
none
of
the
angels
of
mons
legends
partly
because
i
see
or
think
i
see
their
derivation
from
my
own
idle
fiction
but
chiefly
because
i
have
so
far
not
received
one
jot
or
tittle
of
evidence
that
should
dispose
me
to
belief
it
is
idle
indeed
and
foolish
enough
for
a
man
to
say
i
am
sure
that
story
is
a
lie
because
the
supernatural
element
enters
into
it
here
indeed
we
have
the
maggot
writhing
in
the
midst
of
corrupted
offal
denying
the
existence
of
the
sun
but
if
this
fellow
be
a
fool
as
he
is
equally
foolish
is
he
who
says
if
the
tale
has
anything
of
the
supernatural
it
is
true
and
the
less
evidence
the
better
and
i
am
afraid
this
tends
to
be
the
attitude
of
many
who
call
themselves
occultists
i
hope
that
i
shall
never
get
to
that
frame
of
mind
so
i
say
not
that
interventions
are
impossible
not
that
they
have
not
happened
during
this
war
i
know
nothing
as
to
that
point
one
way
or
the
other
but
that
there
is
not
one
atom
of
evidence
so
far
to
support
the
current
stories
of
the
angels
of
mons
for
be
it
remarked
these
stories
are
specific
stories
they
rest
on
the
second
third
fourth
fifth
hand
stories
told
by
a
soldier
by
an
officer
by
a
catholic
correspondent
by
a
nurse
by
any
number
of
anonymous
people
indeed
names
have
been
mentioned
a
lady
name
has
been
drawn
most
unwarrantably
as
it
appears
to
me
into
the
discussion
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
lady
has
been
subject
to
a
good
deal
of
pestering
and
annoyance
she
has
written
to
the
editor
of
evening
denying
all
knowledge
of
the
supposed
miracle
the
psychical
research
society
expert
confesses
that
no
real
evidence
has
been
proffered
to
her
society
on
the
matter
and
then
to
my
amazement
she
accepts
as
fact
the
proposition
that
some
men
on
the
battlefield
have
been
hallucinated
and
proceeds
to
give
the
theory
of
sensory
hallucination
she
forgets
that
by
her
own
showing
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
anybody
has
been
hallucinated
at
all
someone
unknown
has
met
a
nurse
unnamed
who
has
talked
to
a
soldier
anonymous
who
has
seen
angels
but
is
not
evidence
and
not
even
sam
weller
at
his
gayest
would
have
dared
to
offer
it
as
such
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
so
far
then
nothing
remotely
approaching
proof
has
been
offered
as
to
any
supernatural
intervention
during
the
retreat
from
mons
proof
may
come
if
so
it
will
be
interesting
and
more
than
interesting
but
taking
the
affair
as
it
stands
at
present
how
is
it
that
a
nation
plunged
in
materialism
of
the
grossest
kind
has
accepted
idle
rumours
and
gossip
of
the
supernatural
as
certain
truth
the
answer
is
contained
in
the
question
it
is
precisely
because
our
whole
atmosphere
is
materialist
that
we
are
ready
to
credit
anything
save
the
truth
separate
a
man
from
good
drink
he
will
swallow
methylated
spirit
with
joy
man
is
created
to
be
inebriated
to
be
nobly
wild
not
mad
suffer
the
cocoa
prophets
and
their
company
to
seduce
him
in
body
and
spirit
and
he
will
get
himself
stuff
that
will
make
him
ignobly
wild
and
mad
indeed
it
took
hard
practical
men
of
affairs
business
men
advanced
thinkers
freethinkers
to
believe
in
madame
blavatsky
and
mahatmas
and
the
famous
message
from
the
golden
shore
judge
plan
is
right
follow
him
and
and
the
main
responsibility
for
this
dismal
state
of
affairs
undoubtedly
lies
on
the
shoulders
of
the
majority
of
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
christianity
as
courtney
has
so
admirably
pointed
out
is
a
great
mystery
religion
it
is
mystery
religion
its
priests
are
called
to
an
awful
and
tremendous
hierurgy
its
pontiffs
are
to
be
the
pathfinders
the
between
the
world
of
sense
and
the
world
of
spirit
and
in
fact
they
pass
their
time
in
preaching
not
the
eternal
mysteries
but
a
twopenny
morality
in
changing
the
wine
of
angels
and
the
bread
of
heaven
into
gingerbeer
and
mixed
biscuits
a
sorry
transubstantiation
a
sad
alchemy
as
it
seems
to
me
the
bowmen
it
was
during
the
retreat
of
the
eighty
thousand
and
the
authority
of
the
censorship
is
sufficient
excuse
for
not
being
more
explicit
but
it
was
on
the
most
awful
day
of
that
awful
time
on
the
day
when
ruin
and
disaster
came
so
near
that
their
shadow
fell
over
london
far
away
and
without
any
certain
news
the
hearts
of
men
failed
within
them
and
grew
faint
as
if
the
agony
of
the
army
in
the
battlefield
had
entered
into
their
souls
on
this
dreadful
day
then
when
three
hundred
thousand
men
in
arms
with
all
their
artillery
swelled
like
a
flood
against
the
little
english
company
there
was
one
point
above
all
other
points
in
our
battle
line
that
was
for
a
time
in
awful
danger
not
merely
of
defeat
but
of
utter
annihilation
with
the
permission
of
the
censorship
and
of
the
military
expert
this
corner
may
perhaps
be
described
as
a
salient
and
if
this
angle
were
crushed
and
broken
then
the
english
force
as
a
whole
would
be
shattered
the
allied
left
would
be
turned
and
sedan
would
inevitably
follow
all
the
morning
the
german
guns
had
thundered
and
shrieked
against
this
corner
and
against
the
thousand
or
so
of
men
who
held
it
the
men
joked
at
the
shells
and
found
funny
names
for
them
and
had
bets
about
them
and
greeted
them
with
scraps
of
songs
but
the
shells
came
on
and
burst
and
tore
good
englishmen
limb
from
limb
and
tore
brother
from
brother
and
as
the
heat
of
the
day
increased
so
did
the
fury
of
that
terrific
cannonade
there
was
no
help
it
seemed
the
english
artillery
was
good
but
there
was
not
nearly
enough
of
it
it
was
being
steadily
battered
into
scrap
iron
there
comes
a
moment
in
a
storm
at
sea
when
people
say
to
one
another
it
is
at
its
worst
it
can
blow
no
harder
and
then
there
is
a
blast
ten
times
more
fierce
than
any
before
it
so
it
was
in
these
british
trenches
there
were
no
stouter
hearts
in
the
whole
world
than
the
hearts
of
these
men
but
even
they
were
appalled
as
this
hell
of
the
german
cannonade
fell
upon
them
and
overwhelmed
them
and
destroyed
them
and
at
this
very
moment
they
saw
from
their
trenches
that
a
tremendous
host
was
moving
against
their
lines
five
hundred
of
the
thousand
remained
and
as
far
as
they
could
see
the
german
infantry
was
pressing
on
against
them
column
upon
column
a
grey
world
of
men
ten
thousand
of
them
as
it
appeared
afterwards
there
was
no
hope
at
all
they
shook
hands
some
of
them
one
man
improvised
a
new
version
of
the
battlesong
to
tipperary
ending
with
and
we
sha
get
there
and
they
all
went
on
firing
steadily
the
officers
pointed
out
that
such
an
opportunity
for
fancy
shooting
might
never
occur
again
the
germans
dropped
line
after
line
the
tipperary
humorist
asked
what
price
sidney
street
and
the
few
machine
guns
did
their
best
but
everybody
knew
it
was
of
no
use
the
dead
grey
bodies
lay
in
companies
and
battalions
as
others
came
on
and
on
and
on
and
they
swarmed
and
stirred
and
advanced
from
beyond
and
beyond
world
without
end
amen
said
one
of
the
british
soldiers
with
some
irrelevance
as
he
took
aim
and
fired
and
then
he
remembered
he
says
he
can
not
think
why
or
wherefore
a
queer
vegetarian
restaurant
in
london
where
he
had
once
or
twice
eaten
eccentric
dishes
of
cutlets
made
of
lentils
and
nuts
that
pretended
to
be
steak
on
all
the
plates
in
this
restaurant
there
was
printed
a
figure
of
george
in
blue
with
the
motto
anglis
sanctus
may
george
be
a
present
help
to
the
english
this
soldier
happened
to
know
latin
and
other
useless
things
and
now
as
he
fired
at
his
man
in
the
grey
advancing
mass
yards
away
he
uttered
the
pious
vegetarian
motto
he
went
on
firing
to
the
end
and
at
last
bill
on
his
right
had
to
clout
him
cheerfully
over
the
head
to
make
him
stop
pointing
out
as
he
did
so
that
the
king
ammunition
cost
money
and
was
not
lightly
to
be
wasted
in
drilling
funny
patterns
into
dead
germans
for
as
the
latin
scholar
uttered
his
invocation
he
felt
something
between
a
shudder
and
an
electric
shock
pass
through
his
body
the
roar
of
the
battle
died
down
in
his
ears
to
a
gentle
murmur
instead
of
it
he
says
he
heard
a
great
voice
and
a
shout
louder
than
a
crying
array
array
array
his
heart
grew
hot
as
a
burning
coal
it
grew
cold
as
ice
within
him
as
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
tumult
of
voices
answered
to
his
summons
he
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
thousands
shouting
george
st
george
ha
messire
ha
sweet
saint
grant
us
good
deliverance
george
for
merry
england
harow
harow
monseigneur
george
succour
us
ha
george
ha
george
a
long
bow
and
a
strong
bow
heaven
knight
aid
us
and
as
the
soldier
heard
these
voices
he
saw
before
him
beyond
the
trench
a
long
line
of
shapes
with
a
shining
about
them
they
were
like
men
who
drew
the
bow
and
with
another
shout
their
cloud
of
arrows
flew
singing
and
tingling
through
the
air
towards
the
german
hosts
the
other
men
in
the
trench
were
firing
all
the
while
they
had
no
hope
but
they
aimed
just
as
if
they
had
been
shooting
at
bisley
suddenly
one
of
them
lifted
up
his
voice
in
the
plainest
english
gawd
help
us
he
bellowed
to
the
man
next
to
him
but
blooming
marvels
look
at
those
grey
gentlemen
look
at
them
d
see
them
they
not
going
down
in
dozens
nor
in
thousands
it
is
look
look
there
a
regiment
gone
while
talking
to
ye
shut
it
the
other
soldier
bellowed
taking
aim
what
are
ye
gassing
about
but
he
gulped
with
astonishment
even
as
he
spoke
for
indeed
the
grey
men
were
falling
by
the
thousands
the
english
could
hear
the
guttural
scream
of
the
german
officers
the
crackle
of
their
revolvers
as
they
shot
the
reluctant
and
still
line
after
line
crashed
to
the
earth
all
the
while
the
soldier
heard
the
cry
harow
harow
monseigneur
dear
saint
quick
to
our
aid
george
help
us
high
chevalier
defend
us
the
singing
arrows
fled
so
swift
and
thick
that
they
darkened
the
air
the
heathen
horde
melted
from
before
them
more
machine
guns
bill
yelled
to
tom
do
hear
them
tom
yelled
back
but
thank
god
anyway
got
it
in
the
neck
in
fact
there
were
ten
thousand
dead
german
soldiers
left
before
that
salient
of
the
english
army
and
consequently
there
was
no
sedan
in
germany
a
country
ruled
by
scientific
principles
the
great
general
staff
decided
that
the
contemptible
english
must
have
employed
shells
containing
an
unknown
gas
of
a
poisonous
nature
as
no
wounds
were
discernible
on
the
bodies
of
the
dead
german
soldiers
but
the
man
who
knew
what
nuts
tasted
like
when
they
called
themselves
steak
knew
also
that
george
had
brought
his
agincourt
bowmen
to
help
the
english
the
soldiers
rest
the
soldier
with
the
ugly
wound
in
the
head
opened
his
eyes
at
last
and
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
pleasant
satisfaction
he
still
felt
drowsy
and
dazed
with
some
fierce
experience
through
which
he
had
passed
but
so
far
he
could
not
recollect
much
about
it
but
an
agreeable
glow
began
to
steal
about
his
heart
such
a
glow
as
comes
to
people
who
have
been
in
a
tight
place
and
have
come
through
it
better
than
they
had
expected
in
its
mildest
form
this
set
of
emotions
may
be
observed
in
passengers
who
have
crossed
the
channel
on
a
windy
day
without
being
sick
they
triumph
a
little
internally
and
are
suffused
with
vague
kindly
feelings
the
wounded
soldier
was
somewhat
of
this
disposition
as
he
opened
his
eyes
pulled
himself
together
and
looked
about
him
he
felt
a
sense
of
delicious
ease
and
repose
in
bones
that
had
been
racked
and
weary
and
deep
in
the
heart
that
had
so
lately
been
tormented
there
was
an
assurance
of
comfort
of
the
battle
won
the
thundering
roaring
waves
were
passed
he
had
entered
into
the
haven
of
calm
waters
after
fatigues
and
terrors
that
as
yet
he
could
not
recollect
he
seemed
now
to
be
resting
in
the
easiest
of
all
easy
chairs
in
a
dim
low
room
in
the
hearth
there
was
a
glint
of
fire
and
a
blue
puff
of
wood
smoke
a
great
black
oak
beam
roughly
hewn
crossed
the
ceiling
through
the
leaded
panes
of
the
windows
he
saw
a
rich
glow
of
sunlight
green
lawns
and
against
the
deepest
and
most
radiant
of
all
blue
skies
the
wonderful
towers
of
a
vast
gothic
cathedral
mystic
rich
with
imagery
good
lord
he
murmured
to
himself
i
did
know
they
had
such
places
in
france
it
just
like
wells
and
it
might
be
the
other
day
when
i
was
going
past
the
swan
just
as
it
might
be
past
that
window
and
asked
the
ostler
what
time
it
was
and
he
says
time
why
and
there
outside
it
looks
like
summer
that
would
last
for
ever
if
this
was
an
inn
they
ought
to
call
it
he
dozed
off
again
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
a
kindly
looking
man
in
some
sort
of
black
robe
was
standing
by
him
it
all
right
now
is
it
he
said
speaking
in
good
english
yes
thank
you
sir
as
right
as
can
be
i
hope
to
be
back
again
soon
well
well
but
how
did
you
come
here
where
did
you
get
that
he
pointed
to
the
wound
on
the
soldier
forehead
the
soldier
put
his
hand
up
to
his
brow
and
looked
dazed
and
puzzled
well
sir
he
said
at
last
it
was
like
this
to
begin
at
the
beginning
you
know
how
we
came
over
in
august
and
there
we
were
in
the
thick
of
it
as
you
might
say
in
a
day
or
two
an
awful
time
it
was
and
i
do
know
how
i
got
through
it
alive
my
best
friend
was
killed
dead
beside
me
as
we
lay
in
the
trenches
by
cambrai
i
think
it
was
then
things
got
a
little
quieter
for
a
bit
and
i
was
quartered
in
a
village
for
the
best
part
of
a
week
she
was
a
very
nice
lady
where
i
was
and
she
treated
me
proper
with
the
best
of
everything
her
husband
he
was
fighting
but
she
had
the
nicest
little
boy
i
ever
knew
a
little
fellow
of
five
or
six
it
might
be
and
we
got
on
splendid
the
amount
of
their
lingo
that
kid
taught
me
we
and
swot
and
voo
potty
we
and
all
and
i
taught
him
english
you
should
have
heard
that
nipper
say
a
mo
old
un
it
was
a
treat
then
one
day
we
got
surprised
there
was
about
a
dozen
of
us
in
the
village
and
two
or
three
hundred
germans
came
down
on
us
early
one
morning
they
got
us
no
help
for
before
we
could
shoot
well
there
we
were
they
tied
our
hands
behind
our
backs
and
smacked
our
faces
and
kicked
us
a
bit
and
we
were
lined
up
opposite
the
house
where
i
been
staying
and
then
that
poor
little
chap
broke
away
from
his
mother
and
he
run
out
and
saw
one
of
the
boshes
as
we
call
them
fetch
me
one
over
the
jaw
with
his
clenched
fist
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
might
have
done
it
a
dozen
times
if
only
that
little
child
had
seen
him
he
had
a
poor
bit
of
a
toy
i
bought
him
at
the
village
shop
a
toy
gun
it
was
and
out
he
came
running
as
i
say
crying
out
something
in
french
like
man
bad
man
do
hurt
my
anglish
or
i
shoot
you
and
he
pointed
that
gun
at
the
german
soldier
the
german
he
took
his
bayonet
and
he
drove
it
right
through
the
poor
little
chap
throat
the
soldier
face
worked
and
twitched
and
twisted
itself
into
a
sort
of
grin
and
he
sat
grinding
his
teeth
and
staring
at
the
man
in
the
black
robe
he
was
silent
for
a
little
and
then
he
found
his
voice
and
the
oaths
rolled
terrible
thundering
from
him
as
he
cursed
that
murderous
wretch
and
bade
him
go
down
and
burn
for
ever
in
hell
and
the
tears
were
raining
down
his
face
and
they
choked
him
at
last
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
sure
he
said
especially
you
being
a
minister
of
some
kind
i
suppose
but
i
ca
help
it
he
was
such
a
dear
little
man
the
man
in
black
murmured
something
to
himself
in
conspectu
domini
mors
innocentium
dear
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
innocents
then
he
put
a
hand
very
gently
on
the
soldier
shoulder
never
mind
said
he
i
seen
some
service
in
my
time
myself
but
what
about
that
wound
oh
that
that
nothing
but
i
tell
you
how
i
got
it
it
was
just
like
this
the
germans
had
us
fair
as
i
tell
you
and
they
shut
us
up
in
a
barn
in
the
village
just
flung
us
on
the
ground
and
left
us
to
starve
seemingly
they
barred
up
the
big
door
of
the
barn
and
put
a
sentry
there
and
thought
we
were
all
right
there
were
sort
of
slits
like
very
narrow
windows
in
one
of
the
walls
and
on
the
second
day
it
was
i
was
looking
out
of
these
slits
down
the
street
and
i
could
see
those
german
devils
were
up
to
mischief
they
were
planting
their
everywhere
handy
where
an
ordinary
man
coming
up
the
street
would
never
see
them
but
i
see
them
and
i
see
the
infantry
lining
up
behind
the
garden
walls
then
i
had
a
sort
of
a
notion
of
what
was
coming
and
presently
sure
enough
i
could
hear
some
of
our
chaps
singing
hullo
hullo
in
the
distance
and
i
says
to
myself
this
time
so
i
looked
about
me
and
i
found
a
hole
under
the
wall
a
kind
of
a
drain
i
should
think
it
was
and
i
found
i
could
just
squeeze
through
and
i
got
out
and
crept
round
and
away
i
goes
running
down
the
street
yelling
for
all
i
was
worth
just
as
our
chaps
were
getting
round
the
corner
at
the
bottom
bang
went
the
guns
behind
me
and
in
front
of
me
and
on
each
side
of
me
and
then
bash
something
hit
me
on
the
head
and
over
i
went
and
i
do
remember
anything
more
till
i
woke
up
here
just
now
the
soldier
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
when
he
opened
them
he
saw
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
room
besides
the
minister
in
the
black
robes
one
was
a
man
in
a
big
black
cloak
he
had
a
grim
old
face
and
a
great
beaky
nose
he
shook
the
soldier
by
the
hand
by
god
sir
he
said
you
a
credit
to
the
british
army
you
a
damned
fine
soldier
and
a
good
man
and
by
god
i
proud
to
shake
hands
with
you
and
then
someone
came
out
of
the
shadow
someone
in
queer
clothes
such
as
the
soldier
had
seen
worn
by
the
heralds
when
he
had
been
on
duty
at
the
opening
of
parliament
by
the
king
now
by
this
man
said
of
all
knights
ye
be
noblest
and
gentlest
and
ye
be
of
fairest
report
and
now
ye
be
a
brother
of
the
noblest
brotherhood
that
ever
was
since
this
beginning
since
ye
have
yielded
dear
life
for
your
friends
sake
the
soldier
did
not
understand
what
the
man
was
saying
to
him
there
were
others
too
in
strange
dresses
who
came
and
spoke
to
him
some
spoke
in
what
sounded
like
french
he
could
not
make
it
out
but
he
knew
that
they
all
spoke
kindly
and
praised
him
what
does
it
all
mean
he
said
to
the
minister
what
are
they
talking
about
they
do
think
i
let
down
my
pals
drink
this
said
the
minister
and
he
handed
the
soldier
a
great
silver
cup
brimming
with
wine
the
soldier
took
a
deep
draught
and
in
that
moment
all
his
sorrows
passed
from
him
what
is
it
he
asked
nouveau
du
said
the
minister
new
wine
of
the
kingdom
you
call
it
and
then
he
bent
down
and
murmured
in
the
soldier
ear
what
said
the
wounded
man
the
place
they
used
to
tell
us
about
in
sunday
school
with
such
drink
and
such
joy
his
voice
was
hushed
for
as
he
looked
at
the
minister
the
fashion
of
his
vesture
was
changed
the
black
robe
seemed
to
melt
away
from
him
he
was
all
in
armour
if
armour
be
made
of
starlight
of
the
rose
of
dawn
and
of
sunset
fires
and
he
lifted
up
a
great
sword
of
flame
full
in
the
midst
his
cross
of
red
triumphant
michael
brandished
and
trampled
the
apostate
pride
the
monstrance
then
it
fell
out
in
the
sacring
of
the
mass
that
right
as
the
priest
heaved
up
the
host
there
came
a
beam
redder
than
any
rose
and
smote
upon
it
and
then
it
was
changed
bodily
into
the
shape
and
fashion
of
a
child
having
his
arms
stretched
forth
as
he
had
been
nailed
upon
the
old
romance
so
far
things
were
going
very
well
indeed
the
night
was
thick
and
black
and
cloudy
and
the
german
force
had
come
of
their
way
or
more
without
an
alarm
there
was
no
challenge
from
the
english
lines
and
indeed
the
english
were
being
kept
busy
by
a
high
on
their
front
this
had
been
the
german
plan
and
it
was
coming
off
admirably
nobody
thought
that
there
was
any
danger
on
the
left
and
so
the
prussians
writhing
on
their
stomachs
over
the
ploughed
field
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
wood
once
there
they
could
establish
themselves
comfortably
and
securely
during
what
remained
of
the
night
and
at
dawn
the
english
left
would
be
hopelessly
enfiladed
and
there
would
be
another
of
those
movements
which
people
who
really
understand
military
matters
call
readjustments
of
our
line
the
noise
made
by
the
men
creeping
and
crawling
over
the
fields
was
drowned
by
the
cannonade
from
the
english
side
as
well
as
the
german
on
the
english
centre
and
right
things
were
indeed
very
brisk
the
big
guns
were
thundering
and
shrieking
and
roaring
the
were
keeping
up
the
very
devil
racket
the
flares
and
illuminating
shells
were
as
good
as
the
crystal
palace
in
the
old
days
as
the
soldiers
said
to
one
another
all
this
had
been
thought
of
and
thought
out
on
the
other
side
the
german
force
was
beautifully
organised
the
men
who
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
wood
carried
quite
a
number
of
machine
guns
in
bits
on
their
backs
others
of
them
had
small
bags
full
of
sand
yet
others
big
bags
that
were
empty
when
the
wood
was
reached
the
sand
from
the
small
bags
was
to
be
emptied
into
the
big
bags
the
parts
were
to
be
put
together
the
guns
mounted
behind
the
sandbag
redoubt
and
then
as
major
von
und
zu
pleasantly
observed
the
english
pigs
shall
to
quickly
come
the
major
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
way
things
had
gone
that
he
permitted
himself
a
very
low
and
guttural
chuckle
in
another
ten
minutes
success
would
be
assured
he
half
turned
his
head
round
to
whisper
a
caution
about
some
detail
of
the
sandbag
business
to
the
big
karl
heinz
who
was
crawling
just
behind
him
at
that
instant
karl
heinz
leapt
into
the
air
with
a
scream
that
rent
through
the
night
and
through
all
the
roaring
of
the
artillery
he
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
plunged
and
pitched
forward
stone
dead
they
said
that
his
face
as
he
stood
up
there
and
cried
aloud
was
as
if
it
had
been
seen
through
a
sheet
of
flame
they
were
one
or
two
out
of
the
few
who
got
back
to
the
german
lines
most
of
the
prussians
stayed
in
the
ploughed
field
karl
heinz
scream
had
frozen
the
blood
of
the
english
soldiers
but
it
had
also
ruined
the
major
plans
he
and
his
men
caught
all
unready
clumsy
with
the
burdens
that
they
carried
were
shot
to
pieces
hardly
a
score
of
them
returned
the
rest
of
the
force
were
attended
to
by
an
english
burying
party
according
to
custom
the
dead
men
were
searched
before
they
were
buried
and
some
singular
relies
of
the
campaign
were
found
upon
them
but
nothing
so
singular
as
karl
heinz
diary
he
had
been
keeping
it
for
some
time
it
began
with
entries
about
bread
and
sausage
and
the
ordinary
incidents
of
the
trenches
here
and
there
karl
wrote
about
an
old
grandfather
and
a
big
china
pipe
and
pinewoods
and
roast
goose
then
the
diarist
seemed
to
get
fidgety
about
his
health
thus
april
annoyed
for
some
days
by
murmuring
sounds
in
my
head
i
trust
i
shall
not
become
deaf
like
my
departed
uncle
christopher
april
the
noise
in
my
head
grows
worse
it
is
a
humming
sound
it
distracts
me
twice
i
have
failed
to
hear
the
captain
and
have
been
reprimanded
april
so
bad
is
my
head
that
i
go
to
see
the
doctor
he
speaks
of
tinnitus
and
gives
me
an
inhaling
apparatus
that
shall
reach
he
says
the
middle
ear
april
the
apparatus
is
of
no
use
the
sound
is
now
become
like
the
booming
of
a
great
church
bell
it
reminds
me
of
the
bell
at
lambart
on
that
terrible
day
of
last
august
april
i
could
swear
that
it
is
the
bell
of
lambart
that
i
hear
all
the
time
they
rang
it
as
the
procession
came
out
of
the
church
the
man
writing
at
first
firm
enough
begins
to
straggle
unevenly
over
the
page
at
this
point
the
entries
show
that
he
became
convinced
that
he
heard
the
bell
of
lambart
church
ringing
though
as
he
knew
better
than
most
men
there
had
been
no
bell
and
no
church
at
lambart
since
the
summer
of
there
was
no
village
either
the
whole
place
was
a
then
the
unfortunate
karl
heinz
was
beset
with
other
troubles
may
i
fear
i
am
becoming
joseph
kleist
who
is
next
to
me
in
the
trench
asked
me
why
i
jerked
my
head
to
the
right
so
constantly
i
told
him
to
hold
his
tongue
but
this
shows
that
i
am
noticed
i
keep
fancying
that
there
is
something
white
just
beyond
the
range
of
my
sight
on
the
right
hand
may
this
whiteness
is
now
quite
clear
and
in
front
of
me
all
this
day
it
has
slowly
passed
before
me
i
asked
joseph
kleist
if
he
saw
a
piece
of
newspaper
just
beyond
the
trench
he
stared
at
me
solemnly
he
is
a
stupid
fool
and
said
there
is
no
paper
may
it
looks
like
a
white
robe
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
incense
in
the
trench
no
one
seemed
to
notice
it
there
is
decidedly
a
white
robe
and
i
think
i
can
see
feet
passing
very
slowly
before
me
at
this
moment
while
i
write
there
is
no
space
here
for
continuous
extracts
from
karl
heinz
diary
but
to
condense
with
severity
it
would
seem
that
he
slowly
gathered
about
himself
a
complete
set
of
sensory
hallucinations
first
the
auditory
hallucination
of
the
sound
of
a
bell
which
the
doctor
called
tinnitus
then
a
patch
of
white
growing
into
a
white
robe
then
the
smell
of
incense
at
last
he
lived
in
two
worlds
he
saw
his
trench
and
the
level
before
it
and
the
english
lines
he
talked
with
his
comrades
and
obeyed
orders
though
with
a
certain
difficulty
but
he
also
heard
the
deep
boom
of
lambart
bell
and
saw
continually
advancing
towards
him
a
white
procession
of
little
children
led
by
a
boy
who
was
swinging
a
censer
there
is
one
extraordinary
entry
but
in
august
those
children
carried
no
lilies
now
they
have
lilies
in
their
hands
why
should
they
have
lilies
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
transition
over
the
border
line
after
may
there
is
no
reference
in
the
diary
to
bodily
illness
with
two
notable
exceptions
up
to
and
including
that
date
the
sergeant
knows
that
he
is
suffering
from
illusions
after
that
he
accepts
his
hallucinations
as
actualities
the
man
who
can
not
see
what
he
sees
and
hear
what
he
hears
is
a
fool
so
he
writes
i
ask
who
is
singing
maria
stella
that
blockhead
friedrich
schumacher
raises
his
crest
and
answers
insolently
that
no
one
sings
since
singing
is
strictly
forbidden
for
the
present
a
few
days
before
the
disastrous
night
expedition
the
last
figure
in
the
procession
appeared
to
those
sick
eyes
the
old
priest
now
comes
in
his
golden
robe
the
two
boys
holding
each
side
of
it
he
is
looking
just
as
he
did
when
he
died
save
that
when
he
walked
in
lambart
there
was
no
shining
round
his
head
but
this
is
illusion
and
contrary
to
reason
since
no
one
has
a
shining
about
his
head
i
must
take
some
medicine
note
here
that
karl
heinz
absolutely
accepts
the
appearance
of
the
martyred
priest
of
lambart
as
actual
while
he
thinks
that
the
halo
must
be
an
illusion
and
so
he
reverts
again
to
his
physical
condition
the
priest
held
up
both
his
hands
the
diary
states
as
if
there
were
something
between
them
but
there
is
a
sort
of
cloud
or
dimness
over
this
object
whatever
it
may
be
my
poor
aunt
kathie
suffered
much
from
her
eyes
in
her
old
age
one
can
guess
what
the
priest
of
lambart
carried
in
his
hands
when
he
and
the
little
children
went
out
into
the
hot
sunlight
to
implore
mercy
while
the
great
resounding
bell
of
lambart
boomed
over
the
plain
karl
heinz
knew
what
happened
then
they
said
that
it
was
he
who
killed
the
old
priest
and
helped
to
crucify
the
little
child
against
the
church
door
the
baby
was
only
three
years
old
he
died
calling
piteously
for
mummy
and
daddy
and
those
who
will
may
guess
what
karl
heinz
saw
when
the
mist
cleared
from
before
the
monstrance
in
the
priest
hands
then
he
shrieked
and
died
the
dazzling
light
the
new
is
made
of
heavy
steel
which
has
been
specialty
treated
to
increase
its
resisting
power
the
walls
protecting
the
skull
are
particularly
thick
and
the
weight
of
the
helmet
renders
its
use
in
open
warfare
out
of
the
question
the
rim
is
large
like
that
of
the
headpiece
of
mambrino
and
the
soldier
can
at
will
either
bring
the
helmet
forward
and
protect
his
eyes
or
wear
it
so
as
to
protect
the
base
of
the
skull
military
experts
admit
that
continuance
of
the
present
trench
warfare
may
lead
to
those
engaged
in
it
especially
bombing
parties
and
barbed
wire
cutters
being
more
heavily
armoured
than
the
knights
who
fought
at
bouvines
and
at
july
the
war
is
already
a
fruitful
mother
of
legends
some
people
think
that
there
are
too
many
war
legends
and
a
croydon
gentleman
or
lady
i
am
not
sure
which
wrote
to
me
quite
recently
telling
me
that
a
certain
particular
legend
which
i
will
not
specify
had
become
the
chief
horror
of
the
war
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
for
this
point
of
view
but
it
strikes
me
as
interesting
that
the
old
faculty
has
survived
into
these
days
a
relic
of
noble
homeric
battles
and
after
all
what
do
we
know
it
does
not
do
to
be
too
sure
that
this
that
or
the
other
has
happened
and
could
have
happened
what
follows
at
any
rate
has
no
claim
to
be
considered
either
as
legend
or
as
myth
it
is
merely
one
of
the
odd
circumstances
of
these
times
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
can
easily
be
explained
away
in
fact
the
rationalistic
explanation
of
the
whole
thing
is
patent
and
on
the
surface
there
is
only
one
little
difficulty
and
that
i
fancy
is
by
no
means
insuperable
in
any
case
this
one
knot
or
tangle
may
be
put
down
as
a
queer
coincidence
and
nothing
more
here
then
is
the
curiosity
or
oddity
in
question
a
young
fellow
whom
we
will
call
for
avoidance
of
all
identification
delamere
smith
he
is
now
lieutenant
delamere
smith
was
spending
his
holidays
on
the
coast
of
west
south
wales
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
was
something
or
other
not
very
important
in
the
city
and
in
his
leisure
hours
he
smattered
lightly
and
agreeably
a
little
literature
a
little
art
a
little
antiquarianism
he
liked
the
italian
primitives
he
knew
the
difference
between
first
second
and
third
pointed
he
had
looked
through
boutell
engraved
brasses
he
had
been
heard
indeed
to
speak
with
enthusiasm
of
the
brasses
of
sir
robert
de
septvans
and
sir
roger
de
trumpington
one
morning
he
thinks
it
must
have
been
the
morning
of
august
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
into
his
room
that
he
woke
early
and
the
fancy
took
him
that
it
would
be
fine
to
sit
on
the
cliffs
in
the
pure
sunlight
so
he
dressed
and
went
out
and
climbed
up
giltar
point
and
sat
there
enjoying
the
sweet
air
and
the
radiance
of
the
sea
and
the
sight
of
the
fringe
of
creaming
foam
about
the
grey
foundations
of
margaret
island
then
he
looked
beyond
and
gazed
at
the
new
white
monastery
on
caldy
and
wondered
who
the
architect
was
and
how
he
had
contrived
to
make
the
group
of
buildings
look
exactly
like
the
background
of
a
mediæval
picture
after
about
an
hour
of
this
and
a
couple
of
pipes
smith
confesses
that
he
began
to
feel
extremely
drowsy
he
was
just
wondering
whether
it
would
be
pleasant
to
stretch
himself
out
on
the
wild
thyme
that
scented
the
high
place
and
go
to
sleep
till
breakfast
when
the
mounting
sun
caught
one
of
the
monastery
windows
and
smith
stared
sleepily
at
the
darting
flashing
light
till
it
dazzled
him
then
he
felt
queer
there
was
an
odd
sensation
as
if
the
top
of
his
head
were
dilating
and
contracting
and
then
he
says
he
had
a
sort
of
shock
something
between
a
mild
current
of
electricity
and
the
sensation
of
putting
one
hand
into
the
ripple
of
a
swift
brook
now
what
happened
next
smith
can
not
describe
at
all
clearly
he
knew
he
was
on
giltar
looking
across
the
waves
to
caldy
he
heard
all
the
while
the
hollow
booming
tide
in
the
caverns
of
the
rocks
far
below
him
and
yet
he
saw
as
if
in
a
glass
a
very
different
country
a
level
fenland
cut
by
slow
streams
by
long
avenues
of
trimmed
trees
it
looked
he
says
as
if
it
ought
to
have
been
a
lonely
country
but
it
was
swarming
with
men
they
were
thick
as
ants
in
an
anthill
and
they
were
all
dressed
in
armour
that
was
the
strange
thing
about
it
i
thought
i
was
standing
by
what
looked
as
if
it
had
been
a
farmhouse
but
it
was
all
battered
to
bits
just
a
heap
of
ruins
and
rubbish
all
that
was
left
was
one
tall
round
chimney
shaped
very
much
like
the
chimneys
in
pembrokeshire
and
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
went
marching
by
they
were
all
in
armour
and
in
all
sorts
of
armour
some
of
them
had
overlapping
tongues
of
bright
metal
fastened
on
their
clothes
others
were
in
chain
mail
from
head
to
foot
others
were
in
heavy
plate
armour
they
wore
helmets
of
all
shapes
and
sorts
and
sizes
one
regiment
had
steel
caps
with
wide
trims
something
like
the
old
barbers
basins
another
lot
had
knights
tilting
helmets
on
closed
up
so
that
you
could
see
their
faces
most
of
them
wore
metal
gauntlets
either
of
steel
rings
or
plates
and
they
had
steel
over
their
boots
a
great
many
had
things
like
swinging
by
their
sides
and
all
these
fellows
carried
a
sort
of
string
of
big
metal
balls
round
their
waist
then
a
dozen
regiments
went
by
every
man
with
a
steel
shield
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
last
to
go
by
were
in
fact
it
appeared
to
delamere
smith
that
he
watched
the
passing
of
a
host
of
men
in
mediæval
armour
before
him
and
yet
he
knew
by
the
position
of
the
sun
and
of
a
rosy
cloud
that
was
passing
over
the
worm
head
that
this
vision
or
whatever
it
was
only
lasted
a
second
or
two
then
that
slight
sense
of
shock
returned
and
smith
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
the
physical
phenomena
of
the
pembrokeshire
coast
blue
waves
grey
margaret
and
caldy
abbey
white
in
the
sunlight
it
will
be
said
no
doubt
and
very
likely
with
truth
that
smith
fell
asleep
on
giltar
and
mingled
in
a
dream
the
thought
of
the
great
war
just
begun
with
his
smatterings
of
mediæval
battle
and
arms
and
armour
the
explanation
seems
tolerable
enough
but
there
is
the
one
little
difficulty
it
has
been
said
that
smith
is
now
lieutenant
smith
he
got
his
commission
last
autumn
and
went
out
in
may
he
happens
to
speak
french
rather
well
and
so
he
has
become
what
is
called
i
believe
an
officer
of
liaison
or
some
such
term
anyhow
he
is
often
behind
the
french
lines
he
was
home
on
short
leave
last
week
and
said
ten
days
ago
i
was
ordered
to
i
got
there
early
in
the
morning
and
had
to
wait
a
bit
before
i
could
see
the
general
i
looked
about
me
and
there
on
the
left
of
us
was
a
farm
shelled
into
a
heap
of
ruins
with
one
round
chimney
standing
shaped
like
the
chimneys
in
pembrokeshire
and
then
the
men
in
armour
marched
by
just
as
i
had
seen
them
french
regiments
the
things
like
were
and
the
metal
balls
round
the
men
waists
were
the
bombs
they
told
me
that
the
were
used
for
the
march
i
saw
was
part
of
a
big
movement
you
will
hear
more
of
it
before
long
the
bowmen
and
other
noble
ghosts
by
the
londoner
there
was
a
journalist
and
the
reader
well
knows
the
initials
of
his
name
who
lately
sat
down
to
write
a
story
of
course
his
story
had
to
be
about
the
war
there
are
no
other
stories
nowadays
and
so
he
wrote
of
english
soldiers
who
in
the
dusk
on
a
field
of
france
faced
the
sullen
mass
of
the
oncoming
huns
they
were
few
against
fearful
odds
but
as
they
sent
the
home
and
aimed
and
fired
they
became
aware
that
others
fought
beside
them
down
the
air
came
cries
to
george
and
twanging
of
the
the
old
bowmen
of
england
had
risen
at
england
need
from
their
graves
in
that
french
earth
and
were
fighting
for
england
he
said
that
he
made
up
that
story
by
himself
that
he
sat
down
and
wrote
it
out
of
his
head
but
others
knew
better
it
must
really
have
happened
there
was
i
remember
a
clergyman
of
good
credit
who
told
him
that
he
was
clean
mistaken
the
archers
had
really
and
truly
risen
up
to
fight
for
england
the
tale
was
all
up
and
down
the
front
for
my
part
i
had
thought
that
he
wrote
out
of
his
head
i
had
seen
him
at
the
detestable
job
of
doing
it
i
myself
have
hated
this
business
of
writing
ever
since
i
found
out
that
it
was
not
so
easy
as
it
looks
and
i
can
always
spare
a
little
sympathy
for
a
man
who
is
driving
a
pen
to
the
task
of
putting
words
in
their
right
places
yet
the
clergyman
persuaded
me
at
last
who
am
i
that
i
should
doubt
the
faith
of
a
clerk
in
holy
orders
it
must
have
happened
those
archers
fought
for
us
and
the
feather
has
flown
once
again
in
english
battle
since
that
day
i
look
eagerly
for
the
ghosts
who
must
be
taking
their
share
in
this
never
since
the
world
began
was
such
a
war
as
this
surely
marlborough
and
the
duke
talbot
and
harry
of
monmouth
and
many
another
shadowy
captain
must
be
riding
among
our
horsemen
the
old
gods
of
war
are
wakened
by
this
loud
clamour
of
the
guns
all
the
lands
are
astir
it
is
not
enough
that
asia
should
be
humming
like
an
angry
hive
and
the
far
islands
in
arms
australia
sending
her
young
men
and
canada
making
herself
a
camp
when
we
talk
over
the
war
news
we
call
up
ancient
names
we
debate
how
rome
stands
and
what
is
the
matter
with
greece
as
for
greece
i
have
ceased
to
talk
of
her
if
i
wanted
to
say
anything
about
greece
i
should
get
down
the
poetry
book
and
quote
lord
byron
fine
old
ranting
verse
the
mountains
look
on
marathon
and
marathon
looks
on
the
sea
but
standing
on
the
persians
grave
greece
seems
in
the
same
humour
that
made
lord
byron
give
her
up
as
a
hopelessly
flabby
country
is
greece
but
living
greece
no
more
is
as
true
as
ever
it
was
that
last
telegram
of
the
kaiser
must
have
done
its
soothing
work
you
remember
how
it
ran
the
kaiser
was
too
busy
to
make
up
new
phrases
he
telegraphed
to
his
sister
the
familiar
potsdam
sentence
woe
to
those
who
dare
to
draw
the
sword
against
me
i
am
sure
that
i
have
heard
that
before
and
he
added
delightful
and
significant
postscript
my
compliments
to
tino
and
tino
king
constantine
of
the
hellenes
understood
he
is
in
bed
now
with
a
very
bad
cold
and
like
to
stay
in
bed
until
the
weather
be
more
settled
but
before
going
to
bed
he
was
able
to
tell
a
journalist
that
greece
was
going
quietly
on
with
her
proper
business
it
was
her
mission
to
carry
civilisation
to
the
world
truly
that
was
the
mission
of
ancient
greece
what
we
get
from
tino
modern
greece
is
not
civilisation
but
the
little
black
currants
for
but
rome
greece
may
be
dead
or
in
the
currant
trade
rome
is
alive
and
immortal
do
not
talk
to
me
about
signor
giolitti
who
is
quite
sure
that
the
only
things
that
matter
in
this
new
italy
which
is
old
rome
are
her
commercial
relations
with
germany
rome
of
the
legions
our
ancient
mistress
and
conqueror
is
alive
and
she
can
not
be
for
an
ignoble
peace
here
in
my
newspaper
is
the
speech
of
a
poet
spoken
in
rome
to
a
shouting
crowd
i
will
cut
out
the
column
and
put
it
in
the
poetry
book
he
calls
to
the
living
and
to
the
dead
i
saw
the
fire
of
vesta
o
romans
lit
yesterday
in
the
great
steel
works
of
liguria
the
fountain
of
juturna
o
romans
i
saw
its
water
run
to
temper
armour
to
chill
the
drills
that
hollow
out
the
bore
of
guns
this
is
poetry
of
the
old
roman
sort
i
imagine
that
scene
in
rome
the
latest
poet
of
rome
calling
upon
the
romans
in
the
name
of
vesta
holy
fire
in
the
name
of
the
springs
at
which
the
great
twin
brethren
washed
their
horses
i
still
believe
in
the
power
and
the
ancient
charm
of
noble
words
i
do
not
think
that
giolitti
and
the
stockbrokers
will
keep
old
rome
off
the
old
roads
where
the
legions
went
postscript
while
this
volume
was
passing
through
the
press
ralph
shirley
the
editor
of
the
occult
review
called
my
attention
to
an
article
that
is
appearing
in
the
august
issue
of
his
magazine
and
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
see
the
advance
proof
sheets
the
article
is
called
the
angelic
leaders
it
is
written
by
miss
phyllis
campbell
i
have
read
it
with
great
care
miss
campbell
says
that
she
was
in
france
when
the
war
broke
out
she
became
a
nurse
and
while
she
was
nursing
the
wounded
she
was
informed
that
an
english
soldier
wanted
a
holy
picture
she
went
to
the
man
and
found
him
to
be
a
lancashire
fusilier
he
said
that
he
was
a
wesleyan
methodist
and
asked
for
a
picture
or
medal
he
did
care
which
of
george
because
he
had
seen
him
on
a
white
horse
leading
the
british
at
when
the
allies
turned
this
statement
was
corroborated
by
a
wounded
man
who
was
present
he
saw
a
tall
man
with
yellow
hair
in
golden
armour
on
a
white
horse
holding
his
sword
up
and
his
mouth
open
as
if
he
was
saying
come
on
boys
i
put
the
kybosh
on
the
devils
this
figure
was
bareheaded
as
appeared
later
from
the
testimony
of
other
soldiers
and
the
man
and
the
fusilier
knew
that
he
was
george
because
he
was
exactly
like
the
figure
of
george
on
the
sovereigns
had
they
seen
him
with
his
sword
on
every
they
ever
had
from
further
evidence
it
seemed
that
while
the
english
had
seen
the
apparition
of
george
coming
out
of
a
yellow
mist
or
cloud
of
light
to
the
french
had
been
vouchsafed
visions
of
michael
the
archangel
and
joan
of
arc
miss
campbell
says
everybody
has
seen
them
who
has
fought
through
from
mons
to
ypres
they
all
agree
on
them
individually
and
have
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
the
final
issue
of
their
interference
such
are
the
main
points
of
the
article
as
it
concerns
the
great
legend
of
the
angels
of
mons
i
can
not
say
that
the
author
has
shaken
my
incredulity
firstly
because
the
evidence
is
miss
campbell
is
perhaps
acquainted
with
pickwick
and
i
would
remind
her
of
that
famous
and
golden
ruling
of
stareleigh
to
the
effect
that
you
must
tell
us
what
the
soldier
said
it
not
evidence
miss
campbell
has
offended
against
this
rule
and
she
has
not
only
told
us
what
the
soldier
said
but
she
has
omitted
to
give
us
the
soldier
name
and
address
if
miss
campbell
proffered
herself
as
a
witness
at
the
old
bailey
and
said
john
doe
is
undoubtedly
guilty
a
soldier
i
met
told
me
that
he
had
seen
the
prisoner
put
his
hand
into
an
old
gentleman
pocket
and
take
out
a
purse
well
she
would
find
that
the
stout
spirit
of
justice
stareleigh
still
survives
in
our
judges
the
soldier
must
be
produced
before
that
is
done
we
are
not
technically
aware
that
he
exists
at
all
then
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
the
article
itself
which
puzzle
me
the
fusilier
and
the
man
had
seen
st
george
leading
the
british
at
when
the
allies
turned
thus
the
time
of
the
apparition
and
the
place
of
the
apparition
were
firmly
fixed
in
the
two
soldiers
minds
yet
the
very
next
paragraph
in
the
article
begins
was
this
i
asked
but
neither
of
them
could
tell
this
is
an
odd
circumstance
they
knew
and
yet
they
did
not
know
or
rather
they
had
forgotten
a
piece
of
information
that
they
had
themselves
imparted
a
few
seconds
before
another
point
the
soldiers
knew
that
the
figure
on
the
horse
was
george
by
his
exact
likeness
to
the
figure
of
the
saint
on
the
english
sovereign
this
again
is
odd
the
apparition
was
of
a
bareheaded
figure
in
golden
armour
the
george
of
the
coinage
is
naked
except
for
a
short
cape
flying
from
the
shoulders
and
a
helmet
he
is
not
bareheaded
and
has
no
armour
save
the
piece
on
his
head
i
do
not
quite
see
how
the
soldiers
were
so
certain
as
to
the
identity
of
the
apparition
lastly
miss
campbell
declares
that
everybody
who
fought
from
mons
to
ypres
saw
the
apparitions
if
that
be
so
it
is
again
odd
that
nobody
has
come
forward
to
testify
at
first
hand
to
the
most
amazing
event
of
his
life
many
men
have
been
back
on
leave
from
the
front
we
have
many
wounded
in
hospital
many
soldiers
have
written
letters
home
and
they
have
all
combined
this
great
host
to
keep
silence
as
to
the
most
wonderful
of
occurrences
the
most
inspiring
assurance
the
surest
omen
of
victory
it
may
be
so
but
