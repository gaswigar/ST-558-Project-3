the
poor
little
rich
girl
chapter
i
halfway
up
the
shining
surface
of
the
pier
glass
was
a
mark
a
tiny
that
had
been
carefully
drawn
across
the
outer
edge
of
the
wide
bevel
as
gwendolyn
stared
at
the
line
the
reflection
of
her
small
face
in
the
mirror
grew
suddenly
all
white
as
if
some
rude
hand
had
reached
out
and
brushed
away
the
pink
from
cheeks
and
lips
arms
rigid
at
her
sides
and
open
palms
pressed
hard
against
the
flaring
skirts
of
her
she
shrank
back
from
the
glass
she
breathed
aghast
the
gray
eyes
swam
after
a
moment
however
she
blinked
resolutely
to
clear
her
sight
stepped
forward
again
and
straightening
her
slender
little
figure
to
its
utmost
height
measured
herself
a
second
time
against
the
mirror
but
as
before
the
top
of
her
yellow
head
did
not
reach
above
the
not
by
the
smallest
part
of
an
inch
so
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
to
hope
the
worst
was
true
she
had
drawn
the
tiny
line
across
the
edge
of
the
bevel
the
evening
before
when
she
was
only
six
years
old
now
it
was
of
another
day
and
she
was
seven
she
was
not
a
whit
taller
the
tears
began
to
overflow
she
pressed
her
embroidered
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
then
stifling
a
sob
she
crossed
the
nursery
stumbling
once
or
twice
as
she
made
toward
the
long
cushioned
seat
that
stretched
the
whole
width
of
the
front
window
there
among
the
pillows
with
her
loose
hair
falling
about
her
wet
cheeks
and
screening
them
she
lay
down
for
months
she
had
looked
forward
with
secret
longing
to
this
seventh
anniversary
every
morning
she
had
taken
down
the
calendar
that
stood
on
the
top
of
her
and
tallied
off
another
of
the
days
that
intervened
before
her
birthday
and
the
previous
evening
she
had
measured
herself
against
the
pier
glass
without
even
a
single
misgiving
she
rose
at
an
early
hour
her
waking
look
was
toward
the
pier
glass
her
one
thought
was
to
gauge
her
new
height
but
the
morning
was
the
usual
busy
one
when
jane
finished
bathing
and
dressing
her
miss
royle
summoned
her
to
breakfast
an
hour
in
the
followed
an
hour
of
quiet
study
but
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
governess
next
gwendolyn
changed
her
for
a
and
with
jane
holding
her
by
one
small
hand
and
with
thomas
following
stepped
into
the
bronze
cage
that
dropped
down
so
noiselessly
from
nursery
floor
to
wide
outside
the
limousine
was
waiting
she
and
jane
entered
it
thomas
took
his
seat
beside
the
chauffeur
and
in
a
moment
the
motor
was
speeding
away
at
the
her
master
gave
her
the
customary
lesson
she
circled
the
tanbark
on
her
fat
brown
pony
now
to
the
right
at
a
walk
now
to
the
left
at
a
trot
now
back
to
the
right
again
at
a
rattling
canter
with
her
yellow
hair
whipping
her
shoulders
and
her
hat
working
farther
and
farther
back
on
her
bobbing
head
and
tugging
hard
at
the
elastic
under
her
dimpled
chin
after
nearly
an
hour
of
this
walk
trot
and
canter
she
was
very
rosy
and
quite
out
of
breath
then
she
was
put
back
into
the
limousine
and
driven
swiftly
home
and
it
was
not
until
after
her
arrival
that
she
had
a
moment
entirely
to
herself
and
the
first
opportunity
of
comparing
her
height
with
the
tiny
on
the
edge
of
the
mirror
bevel
now
as
she
lay
face
down
on
the
she
know
how
vain
had
been
all
the
longing
of
months
the
realization
so
sudden
and
unexpected
was
a
blow
the
slender
little
figure
among
the
cushions
quivered
under
it
but
all
at
once
she
sat
up
and
disappointment
and
grief
gave
place
to
apprehension
i
wonder
what
the
matter
with
me
she
faltered
aloud
oh
something
awful
i
guess
the
next
moment
caution
succeeded
fear
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
across
the
room
that
mark
was
still
on
the
mirror
for
nurse
or
governess
to
see
and
question
and
it
was
advisable
that
no
one
should
learn
the
unhappy
truth
her
handkerchief
was
damp
with
tears
she
gathered
the
tiny
square
of
linen
into
a
tight
ball
and
rubbed
at
the
industriously
she
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
scarcely
had
she
regained
the
when
the
hall
door
opened
and
thomas
appeared
on
the
sill
almost
filling
the
opening
with
his
tall
figure
as
a
rule
he
wore
his
very
splendid
footman
livery
of
dark
blue
coat
with
buttons
blue
trousers
and
striped
buff
waistcoat
now
he
wore
street
clothes
and
he
had
a
leash
in
his
hand
is
jane
about
miss
gwendolyn
he
inquired
then
seeing
that
gwendolyn
was
alone
would
you
mind
tellin
her
when
she
comes
that
out
takin
the
madam
dogs
for
a
walk
gwendolyn
had
a
new
thought
a
a
walk
she
repeated
and
stood
up
but
tell
jane
if
you
please
continued
he
that
i
be
back
in
time
to
go
well
knows
where
this
was
said
significantly
he
turned
thomas
gwendolyn
hastened
across
to
him
wait
till
i
put
on
my
hat
i
i
going
with
you
her
lay
among
the
dainty
articles
on
her
she
caught
it
up
miss
gwendolyn
exclaimed
thomas
astonished
i
seven
declared
gwendolyn
struggling
with
the
a
whole
year
older
than
i
was
yesterday
and
and
i
an
exasperating
smile
lifted
thomas
lip
oh
you
he
observed
the
hat
settled
she
met
his
look
squarely
did
he
suspicion
anything
and
you
take
the
dogs
out
to
walk
so
she
started
to
pass
him
going
to
walk
his
hair
was
black
and
straight
now
it
seemed
fairly
to
bristle
with
amazement
i
could
take
you
if
you
he
asserted
firmly
blocking
her
advance
leastways
not
without
miss
royle
or
jane
say
yes
it
be
worth
my
job
gwendolyn
lowered
her
eyes
stood
a
moment
in
indecision
then
pulled
off
the
hat
tossed
it
aside
went
back
to
the
window
and
sat
down
at
one
end
of
the
seat
swung
high
on
its
gilded
spring
danced
the
cage
of
her
canary
presently
she
raised
her
face
to
him
he
was
traveling
tirelessly
from
perch
to
from
floor
to
trapeze
again
his
wings
were
half
lifted
from
his
little
body
the
bright
yellow
of
her
own
hair
it
was
as
if
he
were
ready
for
flight
his
round
black
eyes
were
constantly
turned
toward
the
world
beyond
the
window
he
perked
his
head
inquiringly
and
cheeped
now
and
then
with
a
wild
beating
of
his
pinions
he
sprang
sidewise
to
the
shining
bars
of
the
cage
and
hung
there
panting
she
watched
him
for
a
time
made
a
slow
survey
of
the
nursery
next
and
sighed
poor
thing
she
murmured
she
heard
the
rustle
of
silk
skirts
from
the
direction
of
the
hastily
she
shook
out
the
embroidered
handkerchief
and
put
it
against
her
eyes
a
door
opened
there
will
be
no
lessons
this
afternoon
gwendolyn
it
was
miss
royle
voice
gwendolyn
did
not
speak
but
she
lowered
the
handkerchief
a
trifle
and
noted
that
the
governess
was
dressed
for
going
out
in
a
glistening
black
silk
plentifully
ornamented
with
jet
miss
royle
rustled
her
way
to
the
to
have
a
last
look
at
her
bonnet
it
was
a
poke
with
a
quilted
ribbon
circling
its
brim
and
some
lace
arranged
fluffily
it
did
not
reach
many
inches
above
the
spot
where
gwendolyn
had
drawn
the
for
miss
royle
was
small
when
she
had
given
the
poke
a
pat
here
and
a
touch
there
she
leaned
forward
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
face
she
had
a
pale
thin
face
and
thin
faded
hair
on
either
side
of
a
high
bony
nose
were
set
her
eyes
shutting
them
in
and
perched
on
the
thinnest
part
of
her
nose
were
spectacles
i
very
glad
i
can
give
you
a
dear
she
went
on
but
her
tone
was
somewhat
sorrowful
she
detached
a
small
leaf
of
paper
from
a
tiny
book
in
her
and
rubbed
it
across
her
forehead
for
my
neuralgia
is
worse
she
coughed
once
or
twice
behind
a
hand
snapped
the
clasp
of
her
and
started
toward
the
hall
door
it
was
now
that
for
the
first
time
she
looked
at
gwendolyn
and
caught
sight
of
the
bowed
head
the
cheeks
the
suspended
handkerchief
she
stopped
short
gwendolyn
she
exclaimed
annoyed
i
you
not
going
to
be
cross
and
troublesome
and
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
have
a
couple
of
hours
to
myself
this
afternoon
especially
when
i
suffering
then
coaxingly
you
can
amuse
yourself
with
one
of
your
nice
dear
from
under
long
lashes
gwendolyn
regarded
her
in
silence
i
planned
to
lunch
out
went
on
miss
royle
but
you
wo
mind
you
dear
gwendolyn
plaintively
for
i
be
back
at

besides
growing
brighter
you
to
have
what
do
you
think
the
birthday
cake
cook
has
made
i
cake
burst
out
gwendolyn
and
covered
her
eyes
once
more
breathed
miss
royle
gwendolyn
sat
very
still
how
you
be
so
naughty
oh
it
really
wicked
and
ungrateful
of
you
to
be
fretting
and
complaining
you
who
have
many
blessings
but
you
do
appreciate
them
because
you
always
had
them
well
mournfully
solicitous
i
trust
they
never
be
taken
from
you
my
child
ah
know
how
bitter
such
a
loss
is
i
have
been
in
my
present
circumstances
compelled
to
go
out
among
strangers
to
earn
a
scant
living
once
here
she
was
interrupted
the
door
from
the
swung
wide
with
a
bang
gwendolyn
looking
up
saw
her
nurse
jane
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
miss
royle
taller
and
stocky
with
broad
shoulders
and
big
arms
as
she
halted
against
the
open
door
her
hair
was
as
ruddy
as
the
panel
that
made
a
background
for
it
and
she
had
reddish
eyes
and
a
full
round
face
in
the
midst
of
her
face
and
all
out
of
proportion
to
it
was
her
short
nose
which
was
plentifully
sprinkled
with
freckles
so
you
goin
out
she
began
angrily
addressing
the
governess
miss
royle
retreated
a
step
just
for
a
a
couple
of
hours
she
explained
jane
face
grew
almost
as
red
as
her
hair
slamming
the
door
behind
her
she
advanced
i
suppose
it
the
neuralgia
again
she
suggested
with
quiet
heat
the
color
stole
into
miss
royle
pale
cheeks
she
coughed
it
a
little
worse
than
usual
this
afternoon
she
admitted
i
thought
so
said
jane
it
always
worse
how
you
you
ask
me
that
do
you
you
old
now
jane
grew
pallid
with
anger
gwendolyn
listening
contemplated
her
governess
thoughtfully
she
had
often
heard
her
pronounced
a
miss
royle
was
also
pale
that
will
do
she
declared
i
shall
report
you
to
madam
report
echoed
jane
giving
a
loud
harsh
laugh
and
shaking
her
hair
the
huge
pompadour
in
front
the
pug
behind
well
go
ahead
and
i
report
and
your
handy
neuralgia
it
your
duty
to
look
after
gwendolyn
when

miss
royle
but
weakening
noticeably
on
shrilled
jane
oh
do
try
to
fool
me
with
any
of
your
schemin
see
and
i
just
laugh
in
my
sleeve
gwendolyn
fixed
inquiring
gray
eyes
upon
that
sleeve
of
jane
dress
which
was
the
nearer
it
was
of
black
sateen
it
fitted
the
stout
arm
sleekly
this
is
the

this
sneeringly
miss
royle
tossed
her
head
i
thought
perhaps

using
the
car
she
answered
with
fine
sarcasm
jane
began
to
argue
throwing
out
both
hands
how
was
to
know
was
her
birthday
you
might
told
me
about
it
instead
just
all
of
a
sudden
you
shove
her
off
on
my
hands
gwendolyn
eyes
narrowed
resentfully
miss
royle
gave
a
quick
look
toward
the
you
mean
made
plans
she
asked
concern
supplanting
anger
in
her
voice
to
all
appearances
jane
was
near
to
tears
she
did
not
answer
she
nodded
dejectedly
well
jane
you
shall
have
afternoon
declared
miss
royle
soothingly
is
fair
i
did
know
you
counted
on
so
here
another
glance
shot
then
she
beckoned
jane
they
went
into
the
hall
and
gwendolyn
heard
them
whispering
together
when
jane
came
back
into
the
nursery
she
looked
almost
cheerful
now
off
with
that
habit
she
called
to
gwendolyn
briskly
and
into
something
for
your
dinner
i
want
to
wear
a
plaid
dress
announced
gwendolyn
getting
down
from
her
seat
slowly
jane
was
selecting
a
white
muslin
from
a
tall
wardrobe
little
girls
ai
wearin
plaids
this
year
she
declared
shortly

on
gwendolyn
a
pocket
down
on
this
side
she
touched
the
right
skirt
of
her
they
ai
makin

jane
come

repeated
gwendolyn

bade
jane
then
catching
at
the
delicate
square
of
linen
in
gwendolyn
hand
how

git
ink
smeared
over
your
handkerchief
what

jane
ignored
the
question
yesterday
you
said

send
us
went
on
gwendolyn
talking
to
herself
now
rather
than
to
the
nurse
and
like
to
know
where
whereupon
she
fell
to
pondering
the
question
evidently
this
like
many
another
propounded
to
jane
or
miss
royle
to
thomas
to
her
miss
brown
to
mademoiselle
du
bois
her
french
teacher
and
to
her
teacher
of
german
was
one
that
was
meant
to
remain
a
secret
of
the
jane
having
unbuttoned
the
pulled
at
the
small
black
boots
she
was
also
talking
to
herself
for
her
lips
moved
the
moment
gwendolyn
caught
sight
of
her
unshod
feet
she
had
a
new
idea
the
securing
of
a
privilege
by
urging
the
occasion
oh
jane
she
cried
may
i
go
barefoot
just
for
a
while
i
want
to
jane
stripped
off
the
cobwebby
stockings
gwendolyn
wriggled
her
ten
pink
toes
may
i
jane
you
can
go
barefoot
to
said
jane
gwendolyn
bed
stood
midway
of
the
nursery
partly
hidden
by
a
high
tapestried
screen
it
was
a
beautiful
bed
carved
and
enamelled
and
panelled
head
and
foot
with
woven
cane
but
to
gwendolyn
it
was
by
day
a
white
instrument
of
torture
she
gave
it
a
glance
of
disfavor
now
and
refrained
from
pursuing
her
idea
when
the
muslin
dress
was
donned
and
a
pink
satin
replaced
the
black
one
that
bobbed
on
gwendolyn
head
when
she
rode
she
returned
to
the
window
and
sat
down
the
seat
was
deep
and
her
shiny
slippers
stuck
straight
out
in
front
of
her
in
one
hand
she
held
a
fresh
handkerchief
she
nibbled
at
it
thoughtfully
she
was
still
wondering
about
they
thomas
looked
cross
when
he
came
in
to
serve
her
noon
dinner
he
arranged
the
table
with
a
jerk
and
a
bang
so
old
royle
up
and
outed
did
she
he
said
to
jane
hush
counseled
jane
significantly
and
rolled
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
gwendolyn
stopped
nibbling
her
handkerchief
and
our
plans
is
spoiled
went
on
thomas
well
ai
that
our
luck
and
i
suppose
you
could
manage
to
leave
a
certain
party
gwendolyn
had
been
watching
thomas
now
she
fell
to
observing
the
silver
buckles
on
her
slippers
she
might
not
know
who
they
were
but
a
certain
party
leave
repeated
jane
who
with
not
alone
surely
you
do
mean
for
something
gone
wrong
already
as
you
see
if
you
use
your
eyes
and
a
fuss

and
a
bit
of
tea
afterwards
with
a
a
friend
at
this
point
gwendolyn
glanced
up
just
in
time
to
see
thomas
regarding
jane
with
a
broad
grin
and
jane
was
smiling
back
at
him
her
face
so
suffused
with
blushes
that
there
was
not
a
freckle
to
be
seen
now
jane
sighed
and
stood
looking
down
with
hands
folded
what
good
does
it
do
to
talk
though
she
observed

down
nearby
choosing
an
upholstered
spacious
she
lolled
in
it
at
ease
but
watchful

inquired

his
black
brows
excitedly
how

that
gwendolyn
went
calmly
on
with
her
she
already
knew
each
detail
of
the
recital
well
began
jane
she
played
her
usual
trick
of
startin

much
as
a
word
to
me
and
i
just
up
and
give
her
a
gwendolyn

up
and

demanded
jane
and
have
a
doctor
come
gwendolyn
raised
frightened
eyes
a
doctor

been
called
once
in
the
dim
past
when
she
was
a
baby
racked
by
colic
and
budding
teeth
she
did
not
remember
him
but
since
the
era
of

been
mercifully
spared
his
visits
she
faltered

an
idea

he
asked
in
a
loud
whisper
jane
nodded
he
disappeared
to
reappear
at
once
with
a
round
frosted
cake
that
had
a
border
of
pink
icing
upon
its
glazed
white
top
and
set
within
the
circle
of
the
border
were
seven
pink
candles
all
alight

jane
excitedly
pulling
gwendolyn
hand
away
from
her
eyes
is
it
a
beautiful
cake

shall
have
a
piece
those
seven
small
candles
dispelled
the
gloom
with
tears
on
her
cheeks
but
all
eager
and
smiling
once
more
gwendolyn
blew
the
candles
out
and
as
she
bent
forward
to
puff
at
each
tiny
one
jane
held
her
bright
hair
back
for
fear
that
a
strand
might
get
too
near
a
flame
oh
jane
cried
gwendolyn
when
i
blow
like
that
do
all
the
little
lights

a

exclaimed
jane
appealing
to
thomas

to
thomas
and
make
a
big
light
she
started
to

down
from

gwendolyn
stood
up
a
ride
meant
the
limousine
with
its
screening
top
and
little
windows
the
limousine
meant
a
long
tiresome
run
at
good
speed
through
streets
that
she
longed
to
travel
afoot
slowly
with
a
stop
here
and
a
stop
there
and
a
poke
into
things
in
general
her
crimson
cheeks

jane
went
to
shake
her
frilled
apron
into
the
gilded
beside
gwendolyn

she
said
calmly
gwendolyn

upon
thomas
but
i

up
in
the
car
this
afternoon
she
cried
and
i
wo
i
i
wo
jane
gave
a
gasp
of
smothered
rage
the
reddish
eyes
blazed
do
you
want
me
to
send
for
a
great
black
bear
she
demanded
at
that
gwendolyn
quailed
jane
shot
a
glance
toward
thomas
it
invited
suggestion
let
her
take
something
along
he
said
under
his
breath
nodding
toward
a
case
of
shelves
that
stood
opposite
bed
each
shelf
of
the
case
was
covered
with
toys
along
one
sat
a
line
of
daintily
clad
dolls
dolls
dolls
dolls
from
china
with
slanted
eyes
and
a
queue
dolls
from
japan
in
gayly
figured
kimonos
dutch
dolls
a
boy
and
a
girl
a
french
doll
in
an
exquisite
frock
a
russian
an
indian
a
spaniard
a
second
shelf
held
a
shiny
a
black
wooden
snake
beside
its
case
a
tin
soldier
in
an
english
uniform
red
coat
and
cap
held
on
by
a
a
second
uniformed
tin
man
who
turned
somersaults
but
in
repose
stood
upon
his
head
a
black
dog
on
wheels
with
great
floppy
ears
and
a
downy
ducklings
acquired
at
easter
much
good
takin
anything
do
grumbled
jane
then
plucking
crossly
at
a
muslin
sleeve
well
what
do
you
want
your
french
doll
speak
up
i
do
want
anything
asserted
gwendolyn
long
as
i
ca
have
my
puffy
bear
any
more
there
was
a
wide
vacant
place
beside
the
dog
with
the
large
ears
the
little
beast
got
shabby
explained
thomas
and
i
was
compelled
to
throw
him
away
along
with
the
old
like
as
not
some
poor
little
child
has
him
now
she
considered
the
statement
gray
eyes
wistful
then
i
liked
him
she
said
huskily
he
was
old
and
squashy
and
it
would
hurt
him
to
walk
up
the
drive
right
in
the
path
where
the
horses
go
the
dirt
is
loose
there
like
it
was
in
the
road
at
johnnie
blake
in
the
country
i
could
scuff
it
with
my
shoes
you
could
scuff
it
and
i
could
wear
myself
out
cleanin
i
suppose
retorted
jane
and
like
as
not
run
the
risk
of
gittin
some
bad
germs
on
my
hands
and
dyin
of
from
what
rosa
says
it
was
downright
the
way
you
muddied
your
clothes
and
tore
and
messed
in
the
water
after
nasty
that
week
you
was
up
country
allow
you
to
treat
your
beautiful
dresses
like
that
or
climb
about
or
let
the
hot
sun
git
at
you
i
going
to
silence
but
silence
palpitant
with
thought
then
jane
threw
up
her
head
as
if
seized
with
an
inspiration
you
going
to
walk
said
she
all
right
right
walk
if
you
want
to
she
made
as
if
to
set
out
ahead
but
my
she
dropped
her
voice
in
fear
you
no
git
to
the
next
corner
when
steal
you
gwendolyn
was
silent
for
a
long
moment
she
glanced
from
jane
to
thomas
from
thomas
to
jane
and
crooked
her
fingers
in
and
out
of
her
twisted
handkerchief
but
jane
she
said
finally
the
dogs
go
out
walking
and
and
nobody
steals
the
dogs
hear
the
silly
child
cried
jane
nobody
steals
the
dogs
why
if
anybody
was
to
steal
the
dogs
what
good
would
it
do
they
only
pomeranians
anyhow
and
madam
could
go
straight
out
and
buy
more
besides
like
as
not
pomeranians
wo
be
stylish
next
year
and
so
madam
would
care
two
snaps
she
go
buy
the
latest
thing
in
poodles
or
else
a
fine
collie
or
a
spaniel
or
a
spitz
but
other
little
girls
walk
all
the
time
insisted
gwendolyn
and
nobody
steals
jane
crossed
her
knees
pursed
her
mouth
and
folded
her
arms
well
thomas
she
said
shaking
her
head
i
guess
after
all
that
i
have
to
tell
her
ah
yes
i
suppose
so
agreed
thomas
his
tone
was
funereal
gwendolyn
looked
from
one
to
the
other
i
have
wanted
to
continued
jane
dolefully
know
that
but
now
she
forces
me
to
do
it
though
i
as
sorry
as
sorry
can
be
thomas
had
just
taken
his
portion
of
cake
in
one
great
mouthful
my
he
chimed
in
gwendolyn
looked
concerned
but
i
seven
she
reiterated
seven
said
jane
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
matter
gwendolyn
did
not
flinch
you
said
nobody
steals
other
little
girls
went
on
jane
it
true
poor
little
girls
and
boys
steals
you
can
see
runnin
around
loose
everywheres
but
it
different
when
a
little
girl
papa
is
made
of
money
so
much
money
added
thomas
that
it
fairly
makes
me
palm
itch
whereat
he
fell
to
rubbing
one
open
hand
against
a
corner
of
the
piano
gwendolyn
reflected
a
moment
then
but
my
is
made
of
money
she
lingered
a
little
tenderly
over
the
word
father
pronouncing
it
as
if
it
were
two
words
i
he
is
when
i
was
at
johnnie
blake
cottage
we
went
fishing
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
his
arms
were
strong
and
red
like
jane
thomas
sniggered
but
jane
gestured
impatiently
then
making
scared
eyes
what
has
that
to
she
demanded
the
wicked
men
that
keep
watch
of
this
house
gwendolyn
swallowed
what
wicked
men
she
questioned
apprehensively
triumphed
jane
i
that
catch
you
now
just
let
me
ask
you
another
question
are
there
bars
on
the
basement
windows
gwendolyn
lips
parted
to
reply
but
no
words
came
you
do
know
said
jane
but
i
tell
you
something
there
no
bars
on
the
windows
where
little
girls
live
for
the
simple
reason
that
nobody
wants
to
steal
gwendolyn
considered
the
statement
her
fingers
still
busy
knotting
and
unknotting
i
tell
you
jane
launched
forth
again
that
if
you
run
about
on
the
street
like
poor
children
do
you
be
grabbed
up
by
a
band
of
kidnapers
are
are
kidnapers
worse
than
doctors
asked
gwendolyn
worse
than
doctors
scoffed
thomas
worse
worse
than
than
bears
the
last
trace
of
that
rebellious
red
was
gone
up
and
down
went
jane
head
solemnly
kidnapers
carry
knives
big
curved
knives
now
gwendolyn
recalled
a
certain
man
with
a
long
belted
coat
and
a
cap
with
a
shiny
visor
it
was
not
his
height
that
made
her
fear
him
for
her
father
was
fully
as
tall
and
it
was
not
his
coat
or
the
dark
piercing
eyes
under
the
visor
she
feared
him
because
jane
had
often
threatened
her
with
his
coming
and
secondly
because
he
wore
hanging
from
his
belt
a
cudgel
long
and
heavy
and
thick
how
that
cudgel
glistened
in
the
sunlight
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
by
a
thong
worse
than
a
a
she
faltered
policeman
than
the
that
that
always
hanging
around
here
now
jane
giggled
and
blushed
as
red
as
her
hair
hush
she
chided
thomas
poked
a
teasing
finger
at
her
haw
haw
he
laughed
other
people
that
noticed
a
policeman
hangin
round
a
dandy
he
is
he
let
that
old
hand
organ
man
give
him
a
black
eye
pooh
retorted
jane
you
know
how
much
i
care
about
that
policeman
it
only
that
i
like
to
have
him
handy
for
just
such
times
as
this
but
gwendolyn
was
dwelling
on
the
newly
discovered
scourge
of
moneyed
children
what
would
the
kidnapers
do
she
inquired
the
kidnapers
promptly
answered
jane
would
take
you
and
shut
you
up
in
a
nasty
cellar
where
there
was
rats
and
mice
and
things
and
gwendolyn
mouth
began
to
quiver
hastily
jane
put
out
a
hand
but
we
look
sharp
that
nothin
of
the
kind
happens
she
declared
stoutly
for
who
can
git
you
when
you
in
the
car
when
thomas
is
along
to
watch
out
so
with
a
great
show
of
enthusiasm
we
go
out
oh
for
a
ride
she
rose
and
maybe
when
we
git
into
the
country
a
ways
we
invite
thomas
to
take
the
inside
seat
opposite
another
wink
and
he
tell
you
about
soldierin
in
india
and
camps
and
marches
and
elephants
are
there
kidnapers
in
the
country
too
asked
gwendolyn
i
i
guess
i
rather
stay
home
you
wo
see
in
the
country
this
time
of
day
explained
jane
they
all
in
town
huntin
rich
little
children
so
on
with
the
sweet
new
hat
and
a
pretty
coat
she
opened
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
gwendolyn
did
not
move
but
as
she
watched
jane
the
gray
eyes
filled
with
tears
which
overflowed
and
trickled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
if
if
thomas
walked
along
with
us
she
began
could
could
anybody
steal
me
then
jane
was
taking
out
coat
hat
and
gloves
what
would
kidnapers
care
about
she
demanded
contemptuously
they
steal
you
and
then
they
say
to
your
father
me
a
million
dollars
in
cash
if
you
want
miss
gwendolyn
back
and
if
your
father
did
give
the
money
on
the
spot
you
be
sold
to
gipsies
or
or
but
gwendolyn
persisted
thomas
has
killed
she
reminded
are
are
kidnapers
worse
than
she
drew
on
her
gloves
jane
sat
down
and
held
out
the
coat
it

nearly
upset

to
trapse
over
the
hard
pavements
on
my
poor
tired
feet
just
because

your
notions
gwendolyn
began
to
cry
softly
oh

i
thought
i
would
ever
have
to
ride
again
i
was
seven
she
faltered
putting
one
hand
to
her
eyes
stop
that
commanded
jane
again
dirtyin
your
gloves
you
wasteful
little
thing
now
the
big
sobs
came
down

the
yellow
head
oh

said
thomas
little
never

walk
walk
walk
scolded
jane
kneeling
and
preparing
to
adjust
the
new
hat
the
hat
had
wide
ribbons
that
tied
under
the
chin
new
stiff
ribbons
johnnie
did
fasten
hat
on
like
this
wept
gwendolyn
she
moved
her
chin
from
side
to
side
he
just
had
a
a
jane
had
finished
johnnie
blake
johnnie
blake
johnnie
blake
she
mocked
she
gave
gwendolyn
a
little
push
toward
the
front
window
now
no
more
of
your
nonsense
go
and
be
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
and
keep
eye
out
will
you
to
see
that
there
nobody
layin
in
wait
for
us
out
in
front
gwendolyn
went
forward
to
the
and
climbed
up
among
its
cushions
from
there
she
looked
down
upon
the
drive
with
its
sloping
grass
its
smooth
tawny
road
and
soft
brown
and
its
curving
walk
on
the
outer
side
beyond
park
and
road
and
walk
were
above
the
wall
and
beyond
these
was
the
broad
river
with
boats
going
to
and
fro
upon
its
shimmering
surface
the
farther
side
of
the
river
was
walled
like
the
walk
only
the
wall
was
a
cliff
sheer
and
dark
and
and
through
this
timber
could
be
seen
the
roofs
and
chimneys
of
distant
houses
but
gwendolyn
saw
nothing
of
the
beauty
of
the
view
she
did
not
even
glance
down
to
where
on
its
pedestal
stood
the
great
bronze
its
mane
and
tail
flying
its
neck
arched
its
lips
curved
to
neigh
astride
the
horse
was
her
friend
the
general
soldierly
valorous
his
hat
doffed
as
if
in
silent
greeting
to
the
double
procession
of
vehicles
and
pedestrians
that
was
passing
before
him
brave
he
might
be
but
what
help
was
the
general
when
jane
was
ready
for
the
drive
gwendolyn
took
a
firm
hold
of
one
thick
thumb
and
with
thomas
following
they
were
soon
in
the
entrance
hall
there
waiting
as
usual
was
potter
the
butler
he
smiled
at
gwendolyn
but
gwendolyn
did
not
smile
in
return
as
the
cage
had
sunk
swiftly
down
the
long
shaft
her
heart
had
sunk
too
and
now
she
thought
how
old
potter
was
how
thin
and
stooped
with
kidnapers
about
was
a
fit
guardian
for
the
front
door
as
potter
swung
wide
the
heavy
grille
of
wrought
iron
with
its
back
of
gwendolyn
pulled
hard
at
jane
hand
and
went
down
the
granite
steps
and
across
the
sidewalk
as
quickly
as
possible
with
a
timid
glance
to
right
and
left
for
even
as
she
entered
the
car
might
not
that
band
of
suddenly
catch
sight
of
her
and
rushing
over
walk
and
and
roadway
seize
her
and
carry
her
off
she
sank
trembling
upon
the
seat
of
the
limousine
jane
followed
her
then
thomas
closed
the
windowed
door
of
the
motor
and
took
his
place
beside
the
chauffeur
gwendolyn
leaned
forward
for
a
swift
glance
at
the
lower
windows
barred
against
intruders
the
great
house
was
of
stone
on
side
and
rear
it
stood
flat
against
other
houses
but
it
was
built
on
a
corner
and
along
its
front
and
outer
side
the
tops
of
the
basement
windows
were
set
a
foot
or
more
above
the
level
of
the
sidewalk
to
gwendolyn
those
windows
were
huge
eyes
peering
out
at
her
from
under
heavy
lashes
of
iron
the
automobile
started
jane
arranged
her
skirts
and
leaned
back
luxuriously
her
big
hands
folded
on
her
lap
my
but
ai
this
grand
she
exclaimed
then
to
gwendolyn
you
do
mind
do
you
dearie
if
jane
has
a
taste
of
gum
as
we
go
along
gwendolyn
did
not
reply
she
had
not
heard
she
was
leaning
toward
the
little
window
on
her
side
of
the
limousine
in
front
of
jane
was
the
chauffeur
and
skillful
and
crouched
vigilantly
over
his
wheel
but
in
front
of
her
was
thomas
sitting
in
the
proudly
erect
stiff
position
peculiar
to
him
whenever
he
fared
abroad
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
he
seemed
indifferent
that
danger
lurked
for
her
along
the
drive
but
she
as
the
limousine
joined
others
all
speeding
forward
merrily
her
pale
little
face
was
pressed
against
the
pane
of
glass
her
frightened
eyes
roved
continually
searching
the
moving
crowds
chapter
ii
the
nursery
was
on
the
floor
of
the
great
stone
house
this
for
sunshine
and
air
but
the
sunshine
was
gone
when
gwendolyn
returned
from
her
drive
and
a
lights
threw
a
soft
glow
over
the
room
to
shut
out
the
chill
of
the
spring
evening
the
windows
were
down
across
them
were
drawn
the
heavy
hangings
of
rose
brocade
there
was
a
lamp
on
the
larger
of
the
nursery
tables
a
tall
lamp
almost
with
its
ruffles
of
lace
and
chiffon
it
made
conspicuous
two
packages
that
flanked
it
one
small
and
square
the
other
large
and
as
round
as
a
each
was
wrapped
in
white
paper
and
tied
with
red
string
birthday
presents
cried
jane
the
moment
she
spied
them
and
sprang
forward
oh
i
wonder
what
they
are
what
do
guess
gwendolyn
gwendolyn
followed
slowly
blinking
against
the
light
i
ca
guess
she
said
without
enthusiasm
the
case
was
full
of
toys
none
of
which
she
particularly
cherished
indeed
most
of
them
were
carefully
wrapped
from
sight
new
ones
would
merely
form
an
addition
well
what
would
you
queried
jane
catching
up
the
small
package
and
shaking
it
gwendolyn
suddenly
looked
very
earnest
most
in
the
whole
she
asked
yes
what
jane
dropped
the
small
package
and
shook
the
large
one
in
the
whole
whole
big
world
went
on
gwendolyn
to
herself
rather
than
to
her
nurse
she
was
not
looking
at
the
table
but
toward
a
curtained
window
and
the
gray
eyes
had
a
tender
faraway
expression
there
was
a
faint
conventional
pattern
in
the
brocade
of
the
heavy
hangings
it
suggested
trees
with
graceful
boughs
she
clasped
her
hands
i
want
to
live
out
in
the
woods
she
said
at
johnnie
blake
cottage
by
the
stream
that
got
fish
in
it
jane
set
the
big
package
down
with
a
thump
that
selfish
of
you
she
declared
warmly
for
you
know
right
well
that
thomas
and
would
like
to
leave
the
city
and
live
away
out
in
the
country
we
thomas
for
he
had
just
entered
said
thomas
and
it
give
poor
miss
royle
the
neuralgia
jane
and
miss
royle
might
contend
with
each
other
they
made
common
cause
against
but
none
of
you
to
assured
gwendolyn
when
i
was
at
johnnie
blake
that
once
just
potter
went
and
rosa
and
cook
and
rosa
buttoned
my
dresses
and
gave
me
my
bath
and
so
rosa
do
as
well
as
me
interrupted
jane
and
potter
passed
the
dishes
at
table
resumed
gwendolyn
ignoring
the
remark
and
never
hurried
the
ones
hear
that
will
you
thomas
cried
jane
never
hurried
the
ones
thomas
gave
her
a
significant
stare
i
tell
you
a
certain
person
is
growin
keen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
jane
took
gwendolyn
by
the
arm
put
all
that
johnnie
blake
nonsense
out
of
your
head
she
commanded
folks
that
live
in
the
woods
do
know
nothin
they
silly
and
pokey
gwendolyn
shook
her
head
with
deliberation
johnny
blake
was
pokey
she
denied
he
had
a
willow
fishpole
and
a
string
tied
to
it
and
he
caught
shiny
fishes
on
the
end
of
the
string
johnnie
blake
sniffed
jane
oh
i
know
all
about
rosa
told
me
he
a
common
poor
little
boy
and
severely
i
for
see
why
you
was
ever
allowed
to
play
with
him
now
darlin
softening
here
we
stand
fussin
and
you
ai
even
guessed
what
your
presents
are
guess
something
that
real
fine
something
you
like
in
the
city
pettie
she
began
to
unwrap
the
larger
of
the
packages
oh
said
gwendolyn
what
i
like
in
the
well
suddenly
between
her
brows
there
came
a
curious
strained
little
wrinkle
like
the
white
paper
fell
away
a
large
round
box
was
disclosed
to
it
was
tied
a
small
card
this
is
from
your
papa
cried
jane
oh
let
see
what
it
is
the
wrinkle
smoothed
a
smile
broke
like
sudden
sunlight
after
clouds
and
shadow
then
there
poured
forth
all
that
had
filled
her
heart
during
the
past
months
i
like
to
eat
at
the
table
with
my
and
my
she
declared
and
i
do
want
to
have
a
nurse
any
more
like
a
baby
and
i
want
to
go
to
jane
gasped
and
her
big
hands
fell
from
the
round
box
thomas
stared
and
reddened
even
to
his
ears
which
were
large
and
to
both
the
project
cherished
so
long
and
constantly
was
in
the
nature
of
a
bombshell
said
jane
recovering
herself
after
a
moment
so
me
and
thomas
are
to
be
thrown
out
of
our
jobs
are
we
gwendolyn
looked
mild
surprise
but
you
do
to
be
here
she
reminded
and
you
and
thomas
would
have
to
work
any
more
you
could
just
play
all
the
time
she
smiled
up
at
them
encouragingly
thomas
eyed
jane
if
we
ai
careful
he
warned
in
a
low
voice
and
let
a
certain
party
talk
too
much
at
headquarters
the
other
nodded
comprehending
i
look
sharp
she
promised
royle
will
too
whereupon
with
a
forced
change
to
gayety
and
a
toss
of
the
white
card
aside
she
lifted
the
cover
of
the
box
and
peeked
in
it
was
a
canopied
in
gay
stripes
and
built
to
accommodate
a
party
of
twelve
dolls
there
were
six
deep
seats
each
lined
with
ruby
plush
for
as
many
lady
dolls
there
were
six
prancing
arab
steeds
bay
and
chestnut
and
dappled
gray
for
an
equal
number
of
men
a
small
handle
turned
to
wind
up
the
whereupon
the
seats
revolved
gayly
the
arabs
curvetted
and
from
the
base
of
the
stout
canopy
pole
there
sounded
a
merry
tune
oh
darlin
what
a
grand
thing
cried
jane
lifting
gwendolyn
to
stand
on
the
rounding
seat
of
a
chair
a
position
at
other
times
strictly
forbidden
and
what
a
pile
of
money
it
cost
why
it
as
natural
as
the
big
one
in
the
park
the
music
and
the
horses
appealed
other
considerations
moved
temporarily
into
the
background
as
gwendolyn
watched
and
listened
thomas
broke
the
string
of
the
smaller
package
this
is
the
present
he
declared
and
i
warrant
it
a
beauty
it
proved
a
surprise
all
paper
shorn
away
there
stood
revealed
a
green
cabbage
topped
by
something
fluffy
and
hairy
and
this
was
a
rabbit
head
and
when
thomas
had
turned
a
key
in
the
base
of
the
cabbage
the
rabbit
gave
a
sudden
hop
lifted
a
pair
of
long
ears
munched
at
a
bit
of
turned
his
pink
nose
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
and
rolled
two
amber
eyes
and
look
look
shouted
jane
the
eyes
light
up
for
each
was
glowing
as
yellowly
as
the
tiny
electric
bulbs
on
either
side
of
now
what
could
a
little
lady
want
exclaimed
thomas
it
as
wonderful
say
as
a
wax
figger
the
rabbit
with
a
sharp
click
of
farewell
popped
back
into
the
cabbage
gwendolyn
got
down
from
the
chair
it
nice
she
conceded
and
i
going
to
ask
and
to
come
up
and
see
it
neither
thomas
nor
jane
answered
but
again
he
eyed
the
nurse
this
time
flashing
a
silent
warning
after
which
she
began
to
exclaim
excitedly
over
the
rabbit
while
he
wound
up
the
then
the
ruby
seats
and
the
arabs
careened
in
a
circle
the
music
played
the
rabbit
chewed
and
wriggled
and
rolled
his
luminous
eyes
an
interruption
came
in
the
shape
of
a
ring
at
the
telephone
which
stood
on
the
small
table
at
the
head
of
gwendolyn
bed
jane
answered
the
summons
and
received
the
message
a
brief
one
it
worked
however
a
noticeable
change
for
when
jane
turned
round
her
face
was
sullen
gwendolyn
remarked
the
scowls
also
the
fact
that
the
moment
jane
made
thomas
her
confidant
in
an
undertone
he
showed
plain
signs
of
being
annoyed
gwendolyn
saw
the
cabbage
and
all
disappear
into
the
large
round
box
without
a
trace
of
regret
so
much
on
the
part
of
nurse
and
undoubtedly
meant
that
something
of
a
decidedly
pleasant
nature
was
about
to
happen
to
herself
it
was
a
usual
almost
a
daily
occurrence
for
her
to
visit
the
region
of
the
at
the
on
such
occasions
she
saw
one
though
more
often
both
of
her
parents
as
well
as
a
varying
number
of
guests
and
the
privilege
was
one
held
dear
she
coveted
a
dearer
and
her
eyes
roved
to
the
larger
of
her
two
tables
where
stood
the
tall
lamp
there
she
ate
all
her
meals
in
the
condescending
company
of
miss
royle
what
if
the
telephone
message
meant
that
henceforth
she
was
to
eat
standing
on
one
foot
she
waited
developments
and
concealed
her
eagerness
by
snapping
her
underlip
against
her
teeth
with
one
busy
forefinger
her
spirits
fell
when
thomas
appeared
with
the
and
she
ate
with
no
appetite
for
all
that
she
was
eating
alone
alone
that
is
except
for
thomas
who
preserved
a
complete
and
stony
silence
miss
royle
had
not
returned
jane
had
disappeared
toward
her
room
grumbling
about
never
having
a
single
evening
to
call
her
own
but
at
seven
cheer
returned
with
the
realization
that
jane
was
not
getting
ready
the
bed
still
in
a
very
bad
humor
and
touched
up
smartly
by
a
fresh
cap
and
a
dainty
apron
the
nurse
put
gwendolyn
into
a
mull
frock
and
tied
a
bow
atop
her
yellow
hair
where
am
i
going
jane
asked
gwendolyn
she
felt
certain
that
this
was
one
of
the
nights
when
she
was
invited
downstairs
she
hoped
with
a
throb
in
her
throat
that
was
like
the
beat
of
a
heart
that
the
supper
just
past
was
only
afternoon
tea
and
that
there
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
table
in
view
of
her
newly
acquired
year
and
dignity
empty
you
see
soon
enough
answered
jane
shortly
next
a
new
thought
her
father
and
mother
had
not
seen
her
for
two
whole
days
not
since
she
was
six
wonder
if
i
show
i
not
taller
she
mused
under
her
breath
at
precisely
fifteen
minutes
to
eight
jane
took
her
by
the
hand
and
she
went
down
and
down
in
the
bronze
cage
past
the
floor
where
were
the
guest
chambers
past
the
library
floor
which
was
where
her
mother
and
father
lived
to
the
second
floor
of
the
great
house
here
was
the
spacious
and
splendid
and
the
the
doors
of
this
latter
room
were
double
before
them
the
two
halted
not
only
the
pause
at
this
entrance
betrayed
whereto
they
were
bound
but
also
jane
manner
for
the
nurse
was
holding
herself
erect
and
proper
shoulders
back
chin
in
heels
together
gwendolyn
had
often
noted
that
upon
both
jane
and
thomas
her
parents
had
a
curious
stiffening
effect
the
thought
of
that
empty
chair
now
forced
itself
uppermost
the
gray
eyes
darkened
with
sudden
anxiety
now
gwendolyn
whispered
jane
leaning
down
put
your
best
foot
forward
her
face
had
lost
some
of
its
accustomed
color
but
jane
whispered
gwendolyn
back
which
my
best
foot
jane
gave
the
small
hand
she
was
holding
an
impatient
shake
hush
your
rubbishy
questions
she
commanded
we
goin
in
she
tapped
one
of
the
doors
gently
gwendolyn
glanced
down
at
her
daintily
slippered
feet
with
so
little
time
for
reflecting
she
could
not
decide
which
one
she
should
put
forward
both
looked
equally
well
the
next
moment
the
doors
swung
open
and
potter
grave
and
bent
stepped
aside
for
them
to
pass
they
crossed
the
threshold
the
was
wide
and
long
and
lofty
its
wainscot
was
somberly
stained
above
the
wainscot
the
dull
tapestried
walls
reached
to
a
ceiling
richly
panelled
the
center
of
this
dark
setting
was
a
long
table
glittering
with
china
and
crystal
bright
with
silver
and
roses
and
lighted
by
clusters
of
candles
that
reflected
themselves
upon
circular
table
mirrors
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
sat
gwendolyn
father
pale
in
his
black
and
at
the
near
end
sat
her
mother
and
pretty
with
jewels
about
her
bare
throat
and
in
her
fair
hair
and
between
the
two
filling
the
chairs
on
either
side
of
the
table
were
strange
men
and
women
gwendolyn
let
go
of
jane
hand
and
went
toward
her
mother
thither
had
gone
her
first
glance
her
second
had
swept
the
whole
length
of
the
board
to
her
father
face
and
now
without
heeding
any
of
the
others
her
look
circled
swiftly
from
chair
to
chair
searching
not
one
was
empty
the
gray
eyes
blurred
yet
she
tried
to
smile
close
to
that
dear
presence
so
delicately
perfumed
with
a
haunting
perfume
that
was
a
very
part
of
her
mother
charm
and
beauty
she
halted
and
curtsied
precisely
as
monsieur
tellegen
had
taught
her
and
when
the
bow
bobbed
above
the
level
of
the
table
once
more
she
raised
her
face
for
a
kiss
a
murmur
went
up
and
down
the
double
row
of
chairs
gwendolyn
mother
smiled
radiantly
her
glance
over
the
table
was
proud
this
is
my
little
daughter
seventh
birthday
anniversary
she
proclaimed
to
gwendolyn
the
announcement
was
unexpected
but
she
was
quick
very
cautiously
she
lifted
herself
on
her
toes
just
a
little
another
buzz
of
comment
circled
the
board
sweet
said
one
and
and
fine
child
that
now
dear
encouraged
her
mother
gwendolyn
would
have
liked
to
stand
still
and
listen
to
the
chorus
of
praise
but
there
was
something
else
to
do
she
turned
a
corner
of
the
table
and
started
slowly
along
it
curtseying
at
each
chair
as
she
curtsied
she
said
nothing
only
bobbed
the
satin
bow
and
put
out
a
small
hand
and
how
do
you
do
darling
said
the
ladies
and
ah
little
miss
gwendolyn
said
the
men
the
last
man
on
that
side
however
said
something
different
he
she
had
seen
at
the
often
he
slipped
a
hand
into
a
pocket
when
it
came
forth
it
held
an
oblong
box
i
did
forget
that
this
was
your
birthday
he
here
as
he
laid
the
box
upon
gwendolyn
pink
palm
that
for
your
sweet
tooth
everyone
was
watching
the
ladies
beaming
the
men
intent
and
amused
but
gwendolyn
was
unaware
both
of
the
silence
and
the
scrutiny
she
glanced
at
the
box
then
she
looked
up
into
the
friendly
eyes
of
the
donor
but
she
began
but
which
my
sweet
tooth
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
gwendolyn
father
and
mother
joining
in
the
man
who
had
presented
the
box
laughed
heartiest
of
all
then
rose
first
he
bowed
to
her
mother
who
acknowledged
his
salute
graciously
next
he
turned
to
her
father
whose
pale
face
softened
last
of
all
he
addressed
her
miss
gwendolyn
said
he
a
toast
gwendolyn
looked
at
those
which
were
nearest
her
there
was
no
toast
in
sight
only
some
very
nice
moreover
potter
and
thomas
were
not
starting
for
the
pantry
but
were
standing
the
one
behind
her
mother
the
other
behind
her
father
quietly
listening
and
what
this
friend
of
her
father
had
in
his
right
hand
was
not
anything
to
eat
but
a
glass
wherein
some
champagne
was
bubbling
like
amber
she
was
forced
to
conclude
that
he
was
unaccountably
stupid
or
only
queer
or
else
indulging
in
another
of
those
incomprehensible
jokes
he
made
a
little
speech
which
she
could
not
understand
but
which
elicited
much
laughter
and
polite
applause
though
to
her
it
did
not
seem
brilliant
or
even
interesting
reseating
himself
he
patted
her
head
she
put
the
candy
under
her
left
arm
said
a
hasty
to
him
went
to
the
next
chair
curtsied
bobbed
the
and
put
out
a
hand
a
pat
on
the
head
was
dismissal
there
was
no
need
to
wait
for
an
answer
to
her
question
concerning
her
sweet
tooth
experience
had
taught
her
that
whenever
mirth
greeted
an
inquiry
that
inquiry
was
ignored
when
one
whole
side
of
the
table
was
finished
and
she
turned
a
second
corner
her
father
brushed
her
soft
cheek
with
his
lips
did
your
dolls
like
the
he
asked
kindly
yes
fath
er
was
there
something
else
my
little
girl
wanted
now
she
raised
herself
so
far
on
her
toes
that
her
lips
were
close
to
his
ear
for
there
was
a
lady
on
either
side
of
him
and
both
were
plainly
listening
if
if
you
come
up
and
make
it
go
she
said
almost
whispering
he
nodded
energetically
she
went
behind
his
chair
thomas
was
in
wait
there
still
down
here
he
seemed
to
raise
a
wall
of
aloofness
between
himself
and
her
to
wear
a
magnificent
air
all
cold
and
haughty
that
was
quite
foreign
to
the
nursery
as
she
passed
him
she
dimpled
up
at
him
saucily
but
it
failed
to
slack
the
starchy
tenseness
of
his
visage
she
turned
another
corner
and
curtsied
her
way
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
on
this
side
were
precisely
as
many
chairs
as
on
the
other
and
now
you
child
cried
the
ladies
and
haw
haw
do
the
rest
of
us
get
a
smile
said
the
men
when
all
the
curtseying
was
over
and
the
last
corner
was
turned
she
paused
and
what
is
my
daughter
going
to
say
about
the
rabbit
in
the
cabbage
asked
her
mother
there
was
a
man
seated
on
either
hand
gwendolyn
gave
each
a
quick
glance
at
johnnie
blake
she
had
been
often
alone
with
her
father
and
mother
during
that
one
glorious
week
but
in
town
her
little
confidences
for
the
most
part
had
to
be
made
in
just
this
way
under
the
eye
of
listening
guests
and
servants
in
a
low
voice
i
like
the
rabbit
she
answered
but
my
puffy
bear
was
nicer
only
he
got
old
and
shabby
and
so
at
this
point
jane
took
one
quick
step
forward
but
if
you
come
up
to
the
nursery
soon
gwendolyn
hastened
to
add
you
moth
er
yes
indeed
dear
gwendolyn
went
up
to
jane
who
was
waiting
rooted
and
rigid
close
by
the
reddish
eyes
of
the
fairly
bulged
with
importance
her
lips
were
sealed
primly
her
face
was
so
pale
that
every
freckle
she
had
stood
forth
clearly
how
strangely
even
direly
the
great
affected
who
was
so
at
ease
in
the
nursery
no
smile
no
wink
no
remark
either
lively
or
sensible
ever
melted
the
ice
of
countenance
and
it
was
with
a
look
almost
akin
to
pity
that
gwendolyn
held
out
a
hand
jane
took
it
with
a
great
show
of
affection
then
once
more
potter
swung
wide
the
double
doors
gwendolyn
turned
her
head
for
a
last
glimpse
of
her
father
sitting
grave
and
haggard
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
at
her
beautiful
jeweled
mother
at
the
double
line
of
chairs
that
showed
now
a
man
stern
next
the
gayer
colors
of
a
dress
at
the
clustered
lights
the
glitter
the
roses
then
the
doors
closed
making
faint
the
din
of
chatter
and
laughter
and
the
bronze
cage
carried
gwendolyn
up
and
up
chapter
iii
there
was
a
high
wind
blowing
and
the
newly
washed
garments
hanging
on
the
roofs
of
nearby
buildings
were
writhing
and
twisting
violently
and
tugging
at
the
long
swagging
gwendolyn
watching
from
the
side
window
of
the
nursery
pretended
that
the
garments
were
so
many
tortured
creatures
vainly
struggling
to
be
free
and
she
wished
that
two
or
three
of
the
whitest
and
prettiest
might
loose
their
hold
and
go
flying
away
across
the
crescent
of
the
drive
and
the
wide
river
to
liberty
and
happiness
in
the
forest
beyond
among
the
flapping
lines
walked
maids
fully
a
score
of
them
some
were
taking
down
wash
that
was
dry
and
stuffing
it
into
baskets
others
were
busy
hanging
up
limp
pieces
first
giving
them
a
vigorous
shake
then
putting
a
small
portion
of
each
over
the
line
and
pinching
all
securely
into
place
with
huge
wooden
pins
it
seemed
cruel
yet
the
faces
of
the
maids
were
kind
kinder
than
the
faces
of
miss
royle
and
jane
and
thomas
behind
gwendolyn
the
heavy
brocade
curtains
hung
touching
she
parted
them
to
make
sure
that
she
was
alone
in
the
nursery
after
which
she
raised
the
window
just
a
trifle
the
roofs
that
were
white
with
laundry
were
not
those
directly
across
from
the
nursery
but
the
next
street
nevertheless
with
the
window
up
gwendolyn
could
hear
the
crack
and
snap
of
the
whipping
garments
and
an
indistinct
chorus
of
cheery
voices
one
maid
was
singing
a
lilting
tune
the
rest
were
chattering
back
and
forth
with
all
her
heart
gwendolyn
envied
them
envied
their
freedom
and
the
fact
that
they
were
indisputably
and
she
decided
that
later
on
when
she
was
as
big
and
strong
she
would
be
a
and
run
about
on
just
such
level
roofs
joyously
hanging
up
wash
presently
she
raised
the
window
a
trifle
more
so
that
the
lower
sill
was
above
her
head
then
she
piped
in
her
clear
voice
a
maid
heard
her
and
pointed
her
out
to
another
soon
a
number
were
looking
her
way
they
smiled
at
her
too
gwendolyn
smiled
in
return
and
nodded
at
that
one
of
a
group
snatched
up
a
square
of
white
cloth
and
waved
it
instantly
gwendolyn
waved
back
one
by
one
the
maids
went
then
gwendolyn
suddenly
recalled
why
she
was
waiting
alone
while
miss
royle
and
jane
made
themselves
extra
neat
in
their
respective
rooms
why
she
herself
was
dressed
with
such
unusual
care
in
a
pink
muslin
white
silk
stockings
and
black
pumps
the
whole
crowned
by
a
with
the
remembrance
the
was
forgotten
utterly
the
lines
of
limp
white
creatures
on
the
roofs
flung
their
tortured
shapes
about
unheeded
at
the
previous
evening
potter
had
telephoned
that
madam
would
pay
a
morning
visit
to
the
nursery
the
thought
had
kept
gwendolyn
awake
for
a
while
smiling
into
the
dark
kissing
her
own
hands
for
very
happiness
it
had
made
her
heart
beat
wildly
too
for
she
reviewed
all
the
things
she
intended
broaching
to
her
mother
about
eating
at
the
table
and
not
having
a
nurse
any
more
and
going
to
contrary
to
a
secret
plan
of
action
she
slept
late
at
breakfast
excitement
took
away
her
appetite
and
throughout
the
that
followed
her
eyes
read
and
her
lips
repeated
aloud
several
pages
of
standard
literature
for
juveniles
that
her
busy
brain
did
not
comprehend
yet
now
as
she
waited
behind
the
rose
hangings
for
the
supreme
moment
she
felt
strangely
enough
no
impatience
with
three
to
attend
her
privacy
was
not
a
common
privilege
and
therefore
prized
she
fell
to
inspecting
the
row
of
houses
across
the
way
in
search
for
other
strange
but
friendly
faces
there
were
exactly
twelve
houses
opposite
the
corner
one
farthest
from
the
river
she
called
the
house
an
old
lady
lived
there
who
knitted
bright
worsted
also
a
fat
old
gentleman
in
a
gay
who
showed
much
attention
to
a
that
flourished
behind
the
glass
of
the
street
door
gwendolyn
leaned
out
chin
on
palm
to
canvass
the
quaintly
curtained
windows
none
of
which
at
the
moment
framed
a
venerable
head
next
the
house
there
had
been
up
to
a
recent
date
a
vacant
lot
walled
off
from
the
sidewalk
by
a
high
broad
now
a
pit
yawned
where
formerly
was
the
vacant
space
and
instead
of
the
fascinating
pictures
that
decorated
the
one
week
a
baby
rosy
dimpled
and
laughing
the
next
some
huge
lettering
elaborately
combined
with
a
floral
design
the
next
a
mammoth
bottle
red
and
beautiful
and
flanked
by
a
single
gleaming
word
catsup
there
towered
above
street
and
pit
and
even
above
the
chimneys
of
the
house
the
naked
girders
of
a
new
steel
structure
the
girders
were
black
but
rusted
to
a
in
patches
and
streaks
they
were
so
riveted
together
that
through
them
could
be
seen
small
regular
spots
of
light
later
on
as
gwendolyn
knew
floors
and
windowed
walls
and
a
tin
top
would
be
fitted
to
the
framework
and
what
was
now
a
skeleton
would
be
another
house
directly
opposite
the
nursery
on
that
part
of
the
side
street
which
sloped
were
ten
narrow
houses
each
four
stories
high
each
with
fronts
and
steps
each
topped
by
a
large
chimney
and
a
small
chimney
in
every
detail
these
ten
houses
were
precisely
alike
jane
for
some
unaccountable
reason
referred
to
them
as
private
dwellings
but
since
the
roof
of
the
second
house
was
just
a
foot
lower
than
the
roof
of
the
first
the
third
roof
just
a
foot
lower
than
the
roof
of
the
second
and
so
on
to
the
very
tenth
and
last
gwendolyn
called
these
ten
the
the
were
seldom
interesting
as
gwendolyn
glances
traveled
now
from
front
to
front
not
one
presented
even
the
relief
of
a
visiting
her
progress
down
the
line
of
brought
her
by
degrees
to
the
brick
house
on
the
drive
a
large
house
the
wide
entrance
of
which
was
toward
the
river
and
no
sooner
had
she
given
it
one
quick
glance
than
she
uttered
a
little
shout
of
pleased
surprise
the
people
were
back
all
the
shades
were
up
there
was
smoke
rising
from
one
of
the
four
tall
chimneys
and
even
as
gwendolyn
gazed
all
absorbed
interest
the
net
curtains
at
an
upper
window
were
suddenly
drawn
aside
and
a
face
looked
out
it
was
a
face
that
gwendolyn
had
never
seen
before
in
the
brick
house
but
though
it
was
strange
it
was
entirely
friendly
for
as
gwendolyn
smiled
it
a
greeting
it
smiled
her
a
greeting
back
she
was
a
so
much
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
she
wore
a
cap
but
it
was
also
plain
that
her
duties
differed
in
some
way
from
jane
for
her
cap
was
different
shaped
like
a
turned
hollow
and
white
and
marred
by
no
flying
strings
and
she
was
not
a
her
hair
was
almost
as
fair
as
gwendolyn
own
and
it
framed
her
face
in
a
score
of
saucy
wisps
and
curls
her
face
was
pretty
full
and
rosy
like
the
face
of
french
doll
also
it
seemed
certain
even
at
such
a
distance
that
she
had
no
freckles
gwendolyn
waved
both
hands
at
her
she
threw
a
kiss
back
oh
thank
you
cried
gwendolyn
out
loud
she
threw
kisses
with
alternating
the
shook
the
curtains
at
her
then
they
fell
into
place
she
was
gone
gwendolyn
sighed
the
next
moment
she
heard
voices
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
first
thomas
next
a
woman
a
strange
one
this
disappointed
she
turned
to
face
the
screening
curtains
but
she
was
in
no
mood
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
visiting
friends
of
miss
royle
and
who
else
could
this
be
she
decided
to
remain
quietly
in
seclusion
to
emerge
for
no
one
except
her
mother
a
door
opened
a
heavy
step
advanced
followed
by
the
murmur
of
trailing
skirts
upon
carpet
then
thomas
spoke
his
tone
that
full
and
measured
one
employed
not
to
the
governess
to
jane
to
herself
or
to
any
other
common
mortal
but
to
potter
to
her
father
and
mother
and
to
guests
this
is
miss
gwendolyn
nursery
he
announced
beyond
the
curtains
were
persons
of
importance
she
shrank
against
the
window
taking
care
not
to
stir
the
brocade
we
will
wait
here
the
voice
was
clear
musical
thank
you
thomas
heavy
step
retreated
a
door
closed
there
was
a
moment
of
perfect
stillness
then
that
musical
voice
began
again
where
do
you
suppose
that
young
one
is
a
second
voice
rippled
out
a
low
laugh
gwendolyn
laughed
too
silently
her
face
against
the
glass
the
fat
old
gentleman
in
the
house
chanced
to
be
looking
in
her
direction
he
caught
the
broad
smile
and
joined
in
in
the
likely
it
was
the
first
speaker
answering
her
own
inquiry
getting
stuffed
stuffed
gwendolyn
could
appreciate
she
choked
back
a
giggle
with
one
small
hand
someone
else
thought
the
declaration
amusing
for
there
was
another
ripple
then
once
more
that
murmur
of
trailing
skirts
going
toward
the
going
the
opposite
way
also
as
if
one
of
the
two
was
making
a
circuit
of
the
room
presently
just
look
at
this
louise
fancy
such
a
piece
of
furniture
for
a
ridiculous
gwendolyn
cocked
her
yellow
head
to
one
side
after
the
manner
of
her
canary
bad
taste
louise
joined
her
companion
if
you
please
must
cost
a
fabulous
sum
one
or
two
articles
were
moved
on
the
dresser
then
poor
little
girl
observed
the
other
woman
rich
but
gwendolyn
puckered
her
brows
gravely
was
the
speaker
referring
to
clasping
her
hands
tight
she
leaned
forward
a
little
straining
to
catch
every
syllable
as
a
rule
when
gossip
or
criticism
was
talked
in
her
hearing
it
was
insured
against
being
understood
by
the
use
of
strange
terms
spellings
winks
nods
shrugs
or
sudden
stops
at
the
most
important
point
but
now
with
herself
hidden
was
there
not
a
likelihood
of
plain
speech
it
came
the
voice
went
on
this
is
the
first
time
you
met
the
mother
it
i
think
so
indifferently
who
is
she
anyhow
gwendolyn
stared
nobody
at
all
you
know
they
say
she
paused
for
emphasis
now
gwendolyn
eyes
grew
suddenly
round
her
lips
parted
in
surprise
again
yes
encouraged
louise
lower
they
say
she
was
just
an
ordinary
country
girl
pretty
and
horribly
poor
with
a
fair
education
but
no
culture
to
speak
of
she
met
him
he
had
money
and
fell
in
love
with
her
she
married
him
and
oh
she
chuckled
made
the
money
fly
the
two
were
coming
to
settle
themselves
in
chairs
close
to
the
side
window
not
exactly
have
you
heard
what
the
matter
with
her
gwendolyn
face
paled
a
little
there
was
something
the
matter
with
her
mother
her
dear
beautiful
young
mother
the
clasped
hands
were
pressed
to
her
breast
ambitious
hazarded
louise
confidently
it
no
secret
everybody
laughing
at
her
at
the
rebuffs
she
takes
the
money
she
gives
to
charity
wedges
you
understand
the
quantities
of
dresses
she
buys
the
way
she
slaps
on
the
jewels
she
got
the
society
bee
in
her
bonnet
gwendolyn
caught
her
breath
society
bee
in
her
bonnet
ah
breathed
louise
as
if
comprehending
then
dear
dear
she
nothing
else
she
nothing
else
she
nothing
else
bad
as
that
goes
wherever
she
can
shove
in
subscription
lectures
and
musicales
hospital
teas
christmas
bazars
and
she
benches
her
poms
has
boxes
at
the
horse
show
and
the
opera
gives
dinners
and
heaven
knows
what
ha
ha
have
boosted
her
dear
not
a
bit
of
it
make
a
point
of
never
being
seen
with
her
and
he
gwendolyn
swallowed
was
her
father
well
it
has
kept
the
poor
fellow
in
harness
all
the
time
of
course
you
should
have
seen
him
when
he
came
to
town
straight
and
boyish
and
handsome
you
know
the
type
he
changed
burns
his
candles
at
both
ends
hm
gwendolyn
blinked
with
the
effort
of
making
mental
notes
you
have
heard
the
latest
about
him
trying
to
make
some
club
whispering
on
the
edge
of
a
who
told
you
oh
a
little
bird
up
came
both
palms
to
cover
gwendolyn
mouth
but
not
to
smother
mirth
a
startled
cry
had
all
but
escaped
her
a
little
bird
she
knew
of
that
bird
he
had
told
things
against
true
things
more
often
than
not
to
jane
and
miss
royle
and
now
here
he
was
chattering
about
her
father
it
the
usual
story
commented
louise
calmly
with
these
sh
a
moment
of
stillness
as
if
both
were
listening
then
sie
deutsch
i
er
read
it
fairly
well
francais
oui
oui
and
there
followed
in
undertones
a
short
spirited
conversation
in
the
gallic
gwendolyn
made
a
silent
resolution
to
devote
more
time
and
thought
to
the
peevish
and
staccato
instruction
of
miss
du
bois
the
two
were
interrupted
by
a
light
quick
step
outside
again
the
hall
door
opened
oh
you
pardon
my
having
to
desert
you
you
it
was
gwendolyn
mother
i
did
intend
being
so
long
gwendolyn
forward
then
stopped
why
of
course
with
sounds
of
rising
differences
below
stairs
i
find
require
prompt
action
i
fancy
you
have
oceans
of
executive
ability
declared
louise
warmly
that
orphans
home
affair
i
hear
you
managed
it
no
no
really
my
dear
it
was
the
other
woman
to
be
frank
we
must
confess
that
we
have
missed
you
we
been
enjoying
our
glimpse
of
the
nursery
it
simply
cried
louise
and
what
a
perfectly
sweet
have
you
seen
my
little
daughter
thomas
yes
madam
there
a
draught
coming
from
somewhere
it
the
side
window
madam
instinctively
gwendolyn
flattened
herself
against
the
at
her
back
three
or
four
steps
brought
thomas
across
the
floor
then
his
two
big
hands
appeared
high
up
on
the
hangings
the
next
moment
the
hands
parted
sweeping
the
curtains
with
them
to
escape
detection
was
impossible
a
quick
thought
made
gwendolyn
raise
a
face
upon
which
was
a
forced
expression
that
bore
only
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
smile
boo
she
said
jumping
out
at
him
startled
he
fell
back
why
miss
gwendolyn
gwendolyn
repeated
her
mother
surprised
why
what
were
you
doing
there
darling
this
in
a
faint
gasp
from
both
visitors
gwendolyn
came
slowly
forward
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
only
curtsied
so
is
your
little
daughter
a
gloved
hand
was
reached
out
and
gwendolyn
was
drawn
forward
how
gwendolyn
recognized
the
voice
of
louise
now
she
looked
up
and
saw
a
pleasant
face
young
but
not
so
pretty
as
her
mother
she
shook
hands
bashfully
then
shook
again
with
an
older
woman
whose
plain
countenance
was
dimly
familiar
after
which
giving
a
sudden
little
bound
and
putting
up
eager
arms
she
was
caught
to
her
mother
my
baby
cheek
caressed
cheek
she
six
is
she
my
dear
asked
the
plain
elderly
one
oh
she
seven
a
soft
hand
stroked
the
yellow
hair
as
much
as
that
really
the
inference
was
not
lost
upon
gwendolyn
she
tightened
her
embrace
and
turning
her
head
on
her
mother
breast
looked
frank
resentment
the
visitors
were
not
watching
her
they
were
exchanging
glances
and
smiles
faint
and
uneasy
slowly
now
they
began
to
move
toward
the
hall
door
which
stood
open
beside
it
waiting
with
an
impressive
air
was
miss
royle
i
think
we
must
go
louise
oh
we
must
quickly
dear
me
i
almost
forgot
we
promised
to
lunch
with
one
or
two
people
i
wish
you
were
lunching
here
said
gwendolyn
mother
she
freed
herself
gently
from
the
clinging
arms
and
followed
the
two
miss
royle
will
you
take
gwendolyn
as
the
governess
promptly
advanced
with
a
and
a
set
smile
that
was
like
a
grimace
gwendolyn
raised
a
face
tense
with
earnestness
until
half
an
hour
before
her
whole
concern
had
been
for
herself
but
now
to
fail
to
grow
up
to
have
her
hopes
come
short
of
fulfillment
that
was
thing
to
know
that
her
mother
and
father
had
real
and
serious
troubles
of
their
own
that
was
another
oh
do
go
mother
must
tell
the
ladies
what
touching
affection
it
was
the
elder
of
the
visiting
pair
miss
royle
assented
with
a
simper
will
you
come
back
urged
gwendolyn
dropping
her
voice
oh
i
want
to
see
you
darting
a
look
sidewise
all
by
myself
there
was
a
wheel
and
a
flutter
at
the
door
another
silent
exchange
of
comment
question
and
exclamation
all
mingled
eloquently
then
louise
swept
back
what
a
bright
child
she
enthused
does
she
speak
french
she
is
acquiring
two
tongues
at
present
answered
gwendolyn
mother
proudly
french
and
german
it
was
the
elder
woman
i
think
every
little
girl
should
have
those
and
later
on
i
suppose
greek
and
latin
i
thought
of
spanish
and
italian
informed
miss
royle
with
a
conscious
sinuous
shift
from
foot
to
foot
gwendolyn
will
have
tongues
at
her
command
how
once
more
the
gloved
hand
was
extended
to
pat
the
gwendolyn
accepted
the
pat
stolidly
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
face
now
the
elder
of
the
strangers
drew
closer
i
wonder
she
began
addressing
her
hostess
with
almost
a
coy
air
if
we
could
induce
to
take
lunch
with
us
would
that
be
jolly
louise
turning
jolly
come
oh
gwendolyn
mother
looked
down
a
sudden
color
was
mounting
to
her
cheeks
her
eyes
shone
she
said
with
rising
inflection
it
was
acceptance
gwendolyn
stepped
back
the
pink
muslin
in
a
nervous
grasp
at
either
side
oh
you
stay
she
mother
see
you
at
dinnertime
darling
tell
jane
miss
royle
a
bow
louise
led
the
way
quickly
followed
by
the
elderly
lady
mother
came
last
a
bronze
gate
slid
between
the
three
and
gwendolyn
watching
them
go
the
cage
lowered
noiselessly
with
a
last
glimpse
of
upturned
faces
and
waving
hands
gwendolyn
lips
pouting
crossed
toward
the
door
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
she
gave
it
a
smart
pull
a
kneeling
figure
rose
from
behind
it
it
was
jane
who
greeted
her
with
a
nervous
and
somewhat
apprehensive
grin
i
was
waitin
to
jump
out
at
miss
royle
and
give
her
a
scare
when
come
through
she
explained
gwendolyn
said
nothing
chapter
iv
it
was
a
morning
abounding
in
unexpected
good
fortune
for
one
thing
miss
royle
was
indisposed
to
an
extent
that
was
fully
convincing
and
was
lying
down
brows
swathed
by
a
towel
in
her
own
room
for
another
the
bursting
of
a
pipe
on
the
same
floor
as
the
nursery
required
the
prompt
attention
of
a
man
in
a
greasy
cap
and
johnnie
blake
overalls
who
as
he
hammered
and
soldered
and
coupled
lengths
of
piping
with
his
wrench
discussed
various
topics
in
a
loud
voice
with
jane
thus
levying
on
attention
miss
royle
temporary
incapacity
set
aside
the
program
of
study
usual
to
each
forenoon
and
suddenly
aroused
interest
in
plumbing
made
the
canceling
of
that
seem
advisable
it
was
thomas
who
telephoned
the
postponement
and
gwendolyn
found
herself
granted
some
little
time
to
herself
but
she
was
not
playing
any
of
the
games
she
loved
the
absorbing
with
which
she
occupied
herself
on
just
such
rare
occasions
her
own
pleasure
her
own
disappointment
too
these
were
entirely
put
aside
in
a
concern
touching
weightier
matters
slippers
upheld
by
a
hassock
and
slender
figure
bent
across
the
edge
of
the
table
she
had
each
elbow
firmly
planted
on
a
page
of
the
dictionary
at
all
times
the
volume
was
beguiling
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
square
of
always
carried
along
its
top
in
glaring
chalk
the
irritating
reminder
your
dictionary
there
was
diversion
in
turning
the
leaves
at
random
blissfully
ignoring
the
while
any
white
list
that
might
be
inscribed
down
the
whole
of
the
board
to
chance
upon
big
strange
words
but
the
word
she
was
now
poring
over
was
a
small
one
she
spelled
bee
a
she
pondered
the
definition
with
wrinkled
forehead
and
worried
eye
social
the
word
seemed
vaguely
linked
with
that
other
word
society
which
she
had
so
fortunately
overheard
but
what
of
the
remainder
of
that
visitor
declaration
of
scorn
for
the
definition
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
about
any
she
was
shoving
the
pages
forward
with
an
impatient
damp
thumb
in
her
search
for
bonnet
when
thomas
entered
slipping
in
around
the
edge
of
the
hall
door
on
soft
foot
with
a
covert
peek
that
was
designed
to
lend
significance
to
his
coming
his
countenance
which
on
occasion
could
be
so
rigorously
sober
was
fairly
askew
with
a
smile
gwendolyn
stood
up
straight
on
the
hassock
to
look
at
him
and
at
first
glance
divined
that
something
probably
in
the
nature
of
an
edible
might
be
expected
for
the
of
his
liveried
coat
bulged
promisingly
hello
he
saluted
tiptoeing
genially
across
the
room
hello
she
returned
noncommittally
near
the
table
he
reached
into
the
bulging
pocket
and
drew
out
a
small
manila
bag
the
bag
was
partly
open
at
the
top
he
tipped
his
head
to
direct
one
black
eye
upon
its
contents
say
miss
gwendolyn
he
began
like
old
thomas
do
you
gwendolyn
nostrils
widened
and
quivered
receiving
the
tempting
fragrance
of
peanuts
at
the
same
time
her
eyes
lit
with
glad
surprise
since
her
seventh
anniversary
she
had
noted
a
vast
change
for
the
better
in
the
attitude
of
miss
royle
thomas
and
jane
where
previous
to
the
birthday
it
had
seemed
the
main
purpose
of
the
trio
if
not
the
duty
to
circumvent
her
at
every
turn
to
which
end
each
had
a
method
that
was
unique
the
first
commanded
the
second
threatened
thomas
employed
sarcasm
or
bribery
but
now
this
wave
of
thoughtfulness
generosity
and
smooth
speech
marking
a
very
era
in
the
history
of
the
nursery
here
was
fresh
evidence
that
it
was
yet
was
it
not
too
good
to
last
why
she
answered
more
than
half
guessing
that
this
time
bribery
was
in
the
air
but
the
fragrant
bag
resolved
itself
into
a
friendly
offering
thomas
let
it
drop
to
the
table
casting
her
last
doubt
aside
gwendolyn
caught
it
up
eagerly
miss
royle
never
permitted
her
to
eat
peanuts
which
lent
to
them
all
the
charm
of
the
forbidden
she
cracked
a
pod
and
fell
to
crunching
merrily
and
you
would
like
to
see
me
go
away
you
now
went
on
thomas
her
mouth
being
crammed
she
shook
her
head
cordially
ah
i
thought
so
he
tore
the
bag
down
the
side
so
that
she
could
more
easily
get
at
its
store
then
leaning
down
confidentially
and
pointing
a
teasing
finger
at
her
ha
ha
who
was
it
got
caught
yesterday
the
small
jaws
ceased
grinding
she
lifted
her
eyes
their
gray
was
suddenly
clouded
remembering
what
for
a
moment
her
joy
in
the
peanuts
had
blotted
out
but
i
spying
she
denied
earnestly
then
what
you
doin
still
as
mice
behind
them
curtains
the
mist
cleared
her
face
sunned
over
once
more
i
was
waving
at
the
nurse
in
the
brick
house
she
explained
at
that
up
went
thomas
head
his
mouth
opened
his
ears
grew
red
the
nurse
in
the
brick
house
he
repeated
softly
the
one
with
the
curly
hair
went
on
gwendolyn
cracking
more
pods
thomas
turned
his
face
toward
the
side
window
of
the
through
it
could
be
seen
the
chimneys
of
the
brick
house
he
smacked
his
lips
you
like
peanuts
too
said
gwendolyn
she
proffered
the
bag
he
ignored
it
his
look
was
dreamy
there
a
fine
pomeranian
at
the
brick
house
he
remarked
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
seen
her
said
gwendolyn
with
the
nurse
still
in
mind
does
she
smile
nice
now
thomas
waxed
enthusiastic
and
she
a
lot
prettier
close
to
he
declared
than
she
is
with
a
street
between
ah
you
ought
that
moment
jane
entered
fairly
darting
in
here
she
called
sharply
to
gwendolyn
what
you
eatin
peanuts
jane
perfect
frankness
being
the
rule
when
concealment
was
not
possible
jane
came
over
and
where
you
git
she
demanded
promptly
seizing
the
bag
as
contraband
thomas
sudden
suspicion
flamed
in
jane
red
glance
oh
you
must
did
thomas
a
turn
she
observed
thomas
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
i
was
er
um
just
tellin
miss
gwendolyn
he
winked
significantly
that
she
would
like
to
lose
us
so
said
jane
still
sceptical
then
to
gwendolyn
after
a
reflection
let
me

your
dictionary
for
you
pettie
jane
never
likes
to
see
one
of
your
fine
books
lyin
open
that
way
it
might
put
a
strain
on
the
back
emboldened
by
that
cooing
tone
gwendolyn
eyed
the
manila
bag
covetously
i
did
eat
many
she
asserted
gently
argumentative
oh
a
peanut
or
two
wo
hurt

lovie
answered
jane
kneeling
to
present
the
bag
then
drawing
the
figure
close
and
you
tell
him
what
them
two
ladies
had
to
say
no
it
was
decisive
i
told
him
about
i
did
ask
her
interrupted
thomas
no
i
talked
about
how
she
loves
us
and
she
does
jane
ai
it
near
twelve
but
gwendolyn
had
no
mind
to
be
held
as
a
tattler
i
told
him
she
continued
husking
peanuts
busily
about
the
at
the
brick
house
jane
sat
back
ah
she
flashed
a
glance
at
thomas
still
shifting
about
uneasily
between
table
and
door
then
what
the
dearie
it
was
gwendolyn
turn
to
wax
enthusiastic
oh
she
has
sweet
hair
she
exclaimed
and
she
smiles
nice
jealousy
hardened
the
freckled
visage
of
the
kneeling
jane
and
taken
with
you
i
suppose
said
she
she
threw
me
kisses
recounted
gwendolyn
crunching
happily
the
while
and
oh
jane
some
day
may
i
go
over
to
the
brick
house
some
day
you
may
gwendolyn
recognized
the
sudden
change
to
belligerence
and
foreseeing
a
possible
loss
of
the
peanuts
commenced
to
eat
more
rapidly
well
then
she
persisted
she
could
come
over
here
jane
stared
what
do
you
mean
she
demanded
crossly
and
do
you
go
botherin
your
poor
father
and
mother
about
this
strange
woman
do
you
but
she
takes
care
of
a
rich
little
girl
i
there
are
bars
on
the
basement
windows
and
thomas
says
oh
broke
in
thomas
urging
jane
hallward
with
a
nervous
jerk
of
the
head
ah
now
complete
understanding
brought
jane
to
her
feet
she
fixed
thomas
with
blazing
eyes
and
does
thomas
say
darlin
thomas
waited
his
ears
were
a
dead
white
there
a
pomeranian
at
the
brick
house
went
on
gwendolyn
and
the
pretty
nurse
takes
it
out
to
walk
and
and
thomas
is
our
poms
at
the
same
time
jane
was
breathing
hard
and
he
says
she
lots
prettier
close
to
a
bell
rang
sharply
thomas
sprang
away
with
a
gurgle
jane
flounced
after
the
next
moment
gwendolyn
from
the
hassock
upon
which
she
had
settled
in
comfort
heard
a
wrangle
of
voices
first
jane
shrill
accusing
it
was
put
it
into
her
head
to
come
and
take
my
place
from
under
me
and
the
food
out
of
my
very
mouth
and
break
my
next
thomas
sonorous
stuff
and
then
sounds
of
lamentation
and
the
slamming
of
a
door
the
last
peanut
was
eaten
as
gwendolyn
searched
out
some
few
remaining
bits
from
the
crevices
of
the
bag
she
shook
her
yellow
hair
hopelessly
truly
there
was
no
fathoming
the
morning
which
had
begun
so
propitiously
ended
in
gloom
at
the
noon
dinner
thomas
looked
harassed
he
had
set
the
table
for
one
that
single
plate
as
well
as
the
empty
so
popular
with
jane
emphasized
the
infestivity
as
for
the
heavy
curtains
at
the
side
window
which
as
near
as
gwendolyn
could
puzzle
it
out
were
the
cause
of
the
late
unpleasantness
these
were
closely
drawn
having
already
eaten
heartily
gwendolyn
had
little
appetite
furthermore
again
she
was
turning
over
and
over
the
direful
statements
made
concerning
her
parents
she
employed
the
in
formulating
a
plan
that
was
simple
but
daring
one
that
would
bring
quick
enlightenment
concerning
the
things
that
worried
miss
royle
was
still
indisposed
jane
was
locked
in
her
own
room
from
which
issued
an
occasional
low
bellow
when
thomas
too
was
out
of
the
way
gone
with
tray
held
aloft
she
would
carry
it
out
it
called
for
no
great
amount
of
time
no
searching
of
the
dictionary
she
would
close
all
doors
softly
then
fly
to
the
telephone
call
up
her
there
were
times
when
thomas
as
well
as
the
two
others
seemed
to
possess
the
power
of
divination
and
during
the
whole
of
the
dinner
his
manner
showed
distinct
apprehension
the
meal
concluded
even
to
the
use
of
the
and
all
dishes
disposed
upon
the
tray
he
hung
about
puttering
with
the
table
picking
up
crumbs
and
pins
dusting
this
article
and
that
with
a
napkin
all
the
while
working
his
lips
with
silent
speech
and
drawing
down
and
lifting
his
black
menacingly
meanwhile
gwendolyn
fretted
but
found
some
small
diversion
in
standing
before
the
pier
glass
at
which
between
the
shining
rows
of
her
teeth
she
thrust
out
a
tip
of
scarlet
she
was
thinking
about
the
discussion
anent
tongues
held
by
her
mother
and
the
two
visitors
seven
she
murmured
and
viewed
the
greater
part
of
her
own
tongue
thoughtfully
the
afternoon
was
a
afternoon
directly
after
dinner
might
be
expected
the
gallic
teacher
undesired
at
any
hour
thomas
puttered
and
frowned
until
a
light
tap
announced
her
arrival
then
quickly
handed
gwendolyn
over
to
her
company
mademoiselle
du
bois
was
short
and
spare
and
these
defects
she
emphasized
by
means
of
a
wide
hat
and
a
long
feather
boa
she
led
gwendolyn
to
the
there
she
settled
down
in
a
low
chair
opened
a
black
reticule
took
out
a
thick
closely
written
letter
and
fell
to
reading
gwendolyn
amused
herself
by
experimenting
with
the
boa
which
she
festooned
now
over
one
shoulder
now
over
the
other
mademoiselle
she
began
what
kind
of
a
bird
owned
these
feathers
dear
me
mees
gwendolyn
chided
mademoiselle
irritably
she
spoke
with
much
precision
and
only
a
slight
accent
how
you
talk
the
word
was
a
cue
why
not
make
certain
inquiries
of
mademoiselle
but
do
little
ever
talk
returned
gwendolyn
undaunted
the
boa
was
thin
at
one
point
she
tied
a
knot
in
it
and
which
little
bird
is
it
that
tells
things
to
to
people
then
more
to
herself
than
to
mademoiselle
who
was
still
deep
in
her
letter
i
should
wonder
if
it
was
the
little
bird
that
in
the
cuckoo
clock
though
foil
exclaimed
mademoiselle
she
seized
an
end
of
the
boa
and
drew
gwendolyn
to
her
knee
you
make
ze
head
buzz
come
she
reached
for
a
book
on
the
table
mademoiselle
persisted
gwendolyn
twining
and
untwining
if
i
do
my
french
fast
will
you
tell
me
something
what
does
mean
said
mademoiselle
is
not
on
ziss
page
miss
brown
followed
mademoiselle
du
bois
the
one
coming
upon
the
heels
of
the
other
so
that
a
loud
from
the
nursery
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
drowned
the
last
paragraph
of
french
to
gwendolyn
an
interruption
at
any
time
was
welcome
this
day
it
was
doubly
so
she
had
learned
nothing
from
mademoiselle
but
miss
brown
she
made
toward
the
nursery
doing
her
newest
dance
step
miss
brown
was
stocky
with
a
firm
tread
and
an
eye
of
decision
as
gwendolyn
appeared
she
was
seated
at
the
piano
her
face
raised
as
if
she
were
seeking
out
some
spot
on
the
ceiling
and
her
solid
frame
swaying
from
side
to
side
in
the
ecstasy
of
performance
up
and
down
the
of
the
instrument
her
plump
hands
galloped
gwendolyn
paused
beside
the
the
air
was
vibrant
with
melody
the
lifted
face
the
rocking
the
ardent
touch
all
these
inspired
hope
the
gray
eyes
were
wide
with
eagerness
each
corner
of
the
rosy
mouth
was
upturned
the
resounding
notes
of
a
march
ended
with
a
bang
miss
brown
straightened
got
to
her
feet
smiled
down
that
smile
gave
gwendolyn
renewed
encouragement
they
were
alone
she
stood
on
tiptoe
miss
brown
she
began
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
a
bee
that
some
ladies
carry
in
a
miss
brown
smile
of
greeting
went
now
gwendolyn
she
interrupted
severely
are
you
going
to
begin
your
usual
silly
silly
questions
gwendolyn
fell
back
a
step
but
i
did
ask
you
a
silly
question
day
before
yesterday
she
plead
i
just
wanted
to
know
how
could
call
my
german
teacher
miss
take
your
place
if
you
please
bade
miss
brown
curtly
and
waste
my
time
she
pointed
a
stubby
finger
at
the
gwendolyn
climbed
up
her
cheeks
scarlet
with
wounded
dignity
her
breast
heaving
with
a
rancor
she
dared
not
express
do
i
have
to
play
that
old
piece
she
asked
you
must
with
rising
inflection
up
at
johnnie
blake
it
sounded
nice
my
ready
miss
brown
set
the
metronome
to
then
she
consulted
a
watch
gwendolyn
raised
one
hand
to
her
face
and
gulped
come
come
put
your
fingers
on
the
keys
but
my
cheek
itches
get
your
position
i
say
gwendolyn
struck
a
spiritless
chord
miss
brown
gone
gwendolyn
sought
the
long
and
curled
up
among
its
cushions
at
the
side
which
commanded
the
best
view
of
the
general
straight
before
that
martial
figure
on
the
a
man
with
a
and
a
horse
was
picking
up
leaves
he
used
a
shovel
and
each
time
he
raised
it
to
and
emptied
it
into
his
cart
a
few
of
the
leaves
went
whirling
away
out
of
reach
like
frightened
butterflies
but
she
had
no
time
to
pretend
anything
of
the
kind
a
new
and
a
better
plan
this
was
what
she
must
prepare
for
heart
beating
hands
trembling
from
haste
she
had
the
telephone
found
it
dead
to
every
hello
but
she
was
not
discouraged
she
was
only
balked
the
talking
bird
the
bee
her
mother
kept
in
a
bonnet
her
harness
and
the
candles
that
burned
at
both
ends
if
she
had
known
about
them
that
evening
of
her
seventh
anniversary
ignoring
miss
royle
lesson
that
nice
little
girls
do
not
ask
questions
or
worry
father
and
mother
how
easy
it
would
have
been
to
say
what
little
bird
tells
things
about
you
and
have
you
got
a
bee
in
your
bonnet
but
the
questions
could
still
be
asked
she
was
balked
only
temporarily
she
got
down
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
two
photographs
in
silver
frames
stood
upon
it
flanking
the
calendar
at
either
side
she
took
them
down
one
at
a
time
and
looked
at
them
earnestly
the
first
was
of
her
mother
taken
long
long
ago
before
gwendolyn
was
born
the
oval
face
was
delicately
lovely
and
girlish
the
mouth
curved
in
a
smile
that
was
tender
and
sweet
the
second
photograph
showed
a
boyish
young
man
in
a
rough
this
was
her
father
when
he
first
came
to
the
city
his
lips
were
set
together
firmly
almost
determinedly
but
his
face
was
unlined
his
dark
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
despite
all
the
commands
miss
royle
had
issued
despite
jane
threats
and
thomas
warnings
and
putting
aside
too
any
thought
of
what
punishment
might
follow
her
daring
gwendolyn
now
made
a
firm
resolution
see
at
least
one
of
her
parents
immediately
and
as
she
set
the
photographs
back
in
their
places
she
lifted
each
to
kiss
it
she
kissed
the
smiling
lips
of
the
one
the
laughing
eyes
of
the
other
chapter
v
the
crescent
of
the
drive
never
without
its
pageant
the
broad
river
thronged
with
craft
the
high
precipice
and
the
houses
that
could
be
glimpsed
beyond
all
these
played
their
part
in
gwendolyn
she
crowded
the
drive
with
the
soldiers
of
the
general
rank
upon
rank
of
marching
men
whom
he
reviewed
with
pride
while
his
great
bronze
steed
pranced
tirelessly
and
she
a
swordless
joan
of
arc
in
a
hat
and
habit
pranced
close
beside
to
share
all
honors
from
the
wide
back
of
her
own
mettlesome
as
for
the
river
vessels
she
took
long
upon
them
every
detail
of
which
she
carefully
carried
out
the
companions
selected
were
those
smiling
friends
that
appeared
at
neighboring
windows
or
she
chose
hearty
happy
laundresses
from
the
roofs
adding
by
way
of
variety
some
small
bashful
acquaintances
made
at
the
of
monsieur
tellegen
but
more
often
imagining
herself
a
princess
and
the
nursery
a
from
the
of
which
she
viewed
the
great
free
world
she
liked
to
people
the
boats
out
of
stories
that
potter
had
told
her
on
rare
but
happy
occasions
a
prosaic
steamer
became
the
wonderful
ship
of
ulysses
his
seamen
bound
to
smokestacks
and
railing
his
prow
pointed
for
the
ocean
whereinto
the
river
crammed
its
deep
flood
a
smaller
boat
smoking
its
way
changed
into
the
fabled
bark
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
jason
and
at
the
bow
of
this
argo
sat
johnnie
blake
over
the
side
feet
dangling
line
trailing
and
a
silvery
trout
spinning
at
the
hook
a
third
boat
smaller
still
and
driven
forward
by
oars
bore
a
sad
figure
elaine
dead
through
the
plotting
of
cruel
servants
and
now
rowed
by
the
hoary
dumb
toward
a
peaceful
mooring
at
the
foot
of
some
far
timbered
slope
in
each
of
the
houses
across
the
wide
river
she
often
established
a
her
father
was
with
her
always
her
mother
too
in
a
silken
gown
with
a
jeweled
chaplet
on
her
head
but
her
household
was
always
blissfully
free
of
those
whose
chief
design
it
was
to
thwart
and
terrify
her
miss
royle
jane
thomas
her
teachers
as
a
body
also
policemen
doctors
and
bears
old
potter
was
of
course
the
and
rosa
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
she
had
once
been
while
at
johnnie
blake
the
herald
of
a
hated
went
as
maid
gwendolyn
had
often
secretly
coveted
the
superintendent
residence
in
the
park
so
that
instead
of
straggling
along
a
concrete
pavement
at
rare
intervals
held
captive
by
the
hand
that
was
in
jane
she
might
always
have
the
right
to
race
across
the
grass
chase
the
tame
squirrels
to
shelter
climb
a
but
more
earnestly
did
she
covet
a
house
beyond
the
precipice
were
there
not
trees
there
and
rocks
without
doubt
there
were
johnnie
blake
glades
as
well
glades
bright
with
flowers
and
green
with
lacy
ferns
for
of
these
glades
gwendolyn
had
received
proof
following
a
sprinkle
on
a
cool
day
a
light
west
wind
brought
a
butterfly
against
a
pane
of
the
front
window
when
gwendolyn
raised
the
sash
the
butterfly
fluttered
in
throwing
off
a
jeweled
drop
as
he
came
and
alighted
upon
the
dull
rose
and
green
of
a
flower
in
the
border
of
the
nursery
rug
his
wings
were
flat
together
and
he
was
tipped
to
one
side
like
a
skiff
with
tinted
sails
but
when
the
sails
were
dry
and
parted
once
more
and
sunlight
had
replaced
shower
he
launched
forth
from
the
pink
of
palm
and
sped
away
and
away
due
west
but
the
view
from
the
window
beyond
the
line
of
and
beyond
the
buildings
where
the
maids
hung
their
wash
were
roofs
they
seemed
to
touch
to
have
no
streets
between
them
anywhere
they
reached
as
far
as
gwendolyn
could
see
they
were
all
heights
all
shapes
all
varieties
as
to
tops
some
being
level
others
coming
to
a
point
at
one
corner
a
few
ending
in
a
tower
one
tower
which
was
square
and
on
the
edge
of
the
roofs
had
a
clock
in
its
summit
when
night
settled
a
light
sprang
up
behind
the
clock
a
great
round
light
that
was
like
a
single
shining
eye
she
did
not
know
the
proper
name
for
all
those
acres
of
roof
but
jane
called
them
at
all
times
they
were
fascinating
of
a
winter
day
the
snow
whitened
them
into
beauty
the
rain
washed
them
with
its
slanting
till
their
metal
sheeting
glistened
as
brightly
as
the
sides
of
the
horse
the
advanced
by
the
wind
blotted
out
all
but
the
nearest
wrapped
these
in
torn
shrouds
and
heaped
itself
about
the
chimneys
like
the
smoke
of
a
hundred
fires
she
loved
the
roofs
far
more
than
drive
or
river
or
wooded
expanse
more
because
they
meant
so
much
and
that
without
her
having
to
do
much
pretending
for
across
them
in
some
building
which
no
one
had
ever
pointed
out
to
her
in
a
street
through
which
she
had
never
driven
was
her
father
office
she
herself
often
selected
the
building
he
was
in
placing
him
first
in
one
great
structure
then
in
another
whenever
a
new
one
rose
as
it
often
did
there
she
promptly
moved
his
office
once
for
a
whole
week
he
worked
directly
under
the
great
glowing
eye
of
the
clock
just
now
she
was
standing
at
the
side
window
of
the
nursery
looking
away
across
the
roofs
the
fat
old
gentleman
at
the
house
was
sponging
off
the
and
waving
the
long
green
leaves
at
her
in
greeting
gwendolyn
feigned
not
to
see
her
lips
were
firmly
set
a
scarlet
spot
of
determination
burned
round
either
dimple
her
gray
eyes
smouldered
darkly
with
a
purpose
that
was
unswerving
i
just
going
down
there
she
said
aloud
rustle
rustle
it
was
miss
royle
entering
though
saturday
was
yet
two
days
away
the
governess
was
preparing
to
go
out
for
the
afternoon
and
was
busily
engaged
in
drawing
on
her
gloves
her
glance
alternating
between
her
task
and
the
on
the
mantel
gwendolyn
dear
said
she
you
can
have
such
a
long
between
now
and
supper
you
gwendolyn
moved
her
head
up
and
down
in
slow
assent
doing
so
she
rubbed
the
tip
of
her
nose
against
the
smooth
glass
the
glass
was
cool
she
liked
the
feel
of
it
you
can
travel
enthused
miss
royle
and
do
you
think
go
the
gray
eyes
were
searching
the
tiers
of
windows
in
a
distant
granite
pile
oh
asia
i
guess
answered
gwendolyn
indifferently
she
had
lately
reviewed
the
latter
part
of
her
geography
asia
fine
and
how
will
you
travel
darling
in
your
sweet
car
a
pause
miss
royle
was
habitually
honeyed
in
speech
and
full
of
suggestions
when
she
was
setting
out
thus
she
deceived
no
one
yet
it
was
just
as
well
to
humor
her
oh
i
ride
a
or
picking
at
random
from
the
fauna
of
the
world
or
a
llama
or
a
a
she
rubbed
her
nose
so
hard
against
the
glass
that
it
gave
out
a
squeaking
sound
then
off
you
go
and
rustle
rustle
gwendolyn
whirled
this
was
the
moment
if
ever
to
make
her
wish
known
to
assert
her
will
with
a
running
patter
of
slippers
she
cut
off
miss
royle
progress
that
tall
building
down
on
the
sky
she
panted
yes
dear
with
a
simper
is
where
my
father
is
the
smirk
went
miss
royle
stared
down
er
why
she
asked
the
other
look
was
met
squarely
i
going
down
there
to
see
him
ah
breathed
the
governess
i
going
went
on
gwendolyn
passionately
i
want
to
her
lips
trembled
there
something
something
you
want
to
tell
him
dear
purringly
confusion
followed
boldness
gwendolyn
dropped
her
chin
and
made
reply
with
an
inarticulate
murmur
hm
coughed
miss
royle
her
invariably
prepared
the
way
for
important
pronouncements
gwendolyn
waited
for
all
the
familiar
arguments
i
ca
let
you
go
until
you
sent
for
dear
your
papa
does
want
to
be
bothered
and
this
is
probably
his
busy
day
instead
has
anyone
ever
told
you
about
that
street
gwennie
no
still
with
lowered
glance
well
i
would
go
down
into
it
if
were
you
the
tone
was
full
of
hidden
meaning
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
why
asked
gwendolyn
back
against
the
door
the
question
was
put
as
a
challenge
she
did
not
expect
an
answer
an
answer
came
however
well
i
tell
you
the
street
is
full
of
bears
gwendolyn
caught
her
hands
together
in
a
nervous
grasp
all
her
life
she
had
heard
about
bears
and
never
any
good
of
them
according
to
miss
royle
and
jane
these
dread
animals
who
existed
in
all
colors
and
in
nearly
all
climes
made
it
their
special
office
to
eat
up
little
girls
who
disobeyed
she
knew
where
several
of
the
beasts
were
harbored
in
cages
at
the
zoo
from
where
they
sallied
at
the
summons
of
outraged
nurses
and
governesses
but
as
to
their
being
she
lifted
a
face
tense
with
earnestness
is
it
she
asked
hoarsely
my
dear
said
miss
royle
gently
reproving
ask
gwendolyn
reflected
thomas
was
freely
given
to
exaggeration
jane
at
times
resorted
to
bald
falsehood
but
gwendolyn
had
never
found
reason
to
doubt
miss
royle
she
moved
aside
the
governess
turned
to
the
mirror
to
take
a
peep
at
her
poke
and
slung
the
chain
of
her
across
her
arm
then
i
be
home
early
she
said
pleasantly
and
went
out
by
the
door
leading
into
the
nursery
bears
gwendolyn
stood
bewildered
oh
were
the
zoo
bears
in
her
street
did
it
mean
that
he
was
in
danger
the
thought
sent
her
toward
the
nursery
door
as
she
went
she
glanced
back
over
a
shoulder
uneasily
close
to
the
door
she
paused
miss
royle
was
not
yet
gone
for
there
was
a
faint
rustling
in
the
next
room
and
gwendolyn
could
hear
the
quick
of
her
whispering
like
the
low
purl
of
johnnie
blake
presently
silence
gwendolyn
went
in
she
found
jane
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
mouth
puckered
soberly
reddish
eyes
winking
with
disquiet
apprehension
in
the
very
set
of
her
heavy
shoulders
the
sight
halted
gwendolyn
and
filled
her
with
misgivings
had
just
heard
when
it
came
time
to
prepare
for
the
afternoon
gwendolyn
tested
the
matter
yet
without
repeating
miss
royle
dire
statement
let
go
past
where
my
office
is
she
proposed
and
tried
to
smile
jane
was
tucking
a
small
hand
through
a
well
dearie
she
answered
with
a
sigh
and
a
shake
of
her
red
head
you
could
hire
to
go
into
that
street
and
i
would
like
to
see
go
gwendolyn
paled
bears
she
asked
jane
made
big
eyes
then
turning
the
slender
little
figure
carefully
about
gwendolyn
lovie
thinks
you
better
give
the
idear
up
so
it
was
true
jane
who
was
happiest
when
standing
in
opposition
to
others
who
was
certain
to
differ
if
a
difference
was
possible
jane
had
borne
it
out
moreover
she
was
frightened
for
gwendolyn
was
leaning
against
the
nurse
and
she
could
feel
her
shaking
oh
how
one
terrible
thing
followed
another
gwendolyn
felt
utterly
cast
down
and
the
ride
in
the
car
only
increased
her
dejection
for
she
did
not
even
have
the
entertainment
afforded
by
thomas
enlivening
company
he
stayed
beside
the
chauffeur
as
he
had
indeed
ever
since
the
memorable
feast
of
peanuts
and
avoided
turning
his
haughty
black
head
jane
was
morose
now
and
then
for
no
apparent
reason
she
sniffled
gwendolyn
mind
was
occupied
by
a
terrifying
series
of
pictures
that
miss
royle
declaration
called
up
the
central
figure
of
each
picture
was
her
father
his
safety
threatened
arrived
home
she
resolved
upon
still
another
course
of
action
she
was
forced
to
give
up
visiting
her
father
at
his
office
but
she
would
steal
down
to
the
part
of
the
house
at
a
time
than
the
that
very
night
evening
fell
and
she
was
not
asked
to
appear
in
the
great
that
strengthened
her
determination
however
to
give
a
hint
of
it
would
be
folly
so
while
miss
royle
picked
at
a
chop
and
tittered
over
copious
draughts
of
tea
and
thomas
chattered
unrebuked
she
ate
her
supper
in
silence
ordinarily
she
rebelled
at
being
undressed
she
was
not
sleepy
or
she
wanted
to
watch
the
drive
or
she
did
not
believe
it
was
seven
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
clock
but
supper
over
and
seven
on
the
strike
she
went
willingly
to
bed
when
gwendolyn
was
under
the
covers
and
all
the
shades
were
down
jane
stepped
into
the
leaving
the
door
slightly
ajar
she
snapped
on
the
lights
above
the
table
then
gwendolyn
heard
the
crackling
of
a
she
lay
thinking
why
had
she
not
been
asked
to
the
great
at
seven
her
father
if
all
were
well
should
be
sitting
down
to
his
dinner
but
was
he
ill
or
hurt
a
dragged
past
jane
left
her
paper
and
tiptoed
into
the
nursery
gwendolyn
did
not
speak
or
move
when
the
nurse
approached
the
bed
and
looked
down
gwendolyn
shut
her
eyes
jane
tiptoed
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
a
moment
later
gwendolyn
heard
another
door
open
and
shut
then
the
rumble
of
a
man
deep
voice
and
the
shriller
tones
of
a
woman
the
chorus
of
indistinct
voices
made
gwendolyn
sleepy
she
found
her
eyelids
drooping
in
spite
of
herself
that
would
never
do
to
keep
herself
awake
she
got
up
cautiously
put
on
her
slippers
and
stole
to
the
front
window
climbed
upon
the
long
seat
and
drew
aside
the
shade
softly
the
night
was
moonless
clouds
hid
the
stars
the
street
lamps
disclosed
the
crescent
of
the
drive
only
dimly
beyond
the
drive
the
river
stretched
like
a
smooth
wide
ribbon
of
black
satin
it
undulated
gently
upon
the
dark
water
of
the
farther
edge
a
procession
of
lights
laid
a
fringe
of
gold
there
were
other
lights
where
beyond
the
precipice
stood
the
forest
houses
where
moored
boats
rocked
at
a
and
on
boats
that
were
plying
past
a
few
lights
made
on
the
but
most
brilliant
of
all
were
those
forming
the
monster
letters
of
words
these
words
gwendolyn
did
not
pronounce
for
miss
royle
whenever
she
chanced
to
look
out
and
see
them
said
shameful
or
what
a
disgrace
or
abominable
and
gwendolyn
guessed
that
the
words
were
wicked
as
she
knelt
peering
out
sounds
from
city
and
river
came
up
to
her
there
was
the
distant
roll
of
the
warning
honk
of
an
automobile
the
scream
of
a
tug
and
lesser
sounds
feet
upon
the
sidewalk
under
the
window
low
laughter
from
the
dim
walk
she
wondered
about
her
father
suddenly
there
rose
to
her
window
a
cry
she
recognized
it
the
monotonous
cry
of
a
man
who
often
hurried
past
with
a
bundle
of
newspapers
under
his
arm
now
it
startled
her
it
filled
her
with
foreboding
uxtra
uxtra
about
the
in
ump
street
street
street
gwendolyn
strained
her
ears
to
catch
the
words
what
if
it
were
the
street
where
her
fath
uxtra
uxtra
cried
the
voice
again
it
was
nearer
yet
the
words
were
no
clearer
about
the
in
ump
street
he
passed
his
cry
died
in
the
distance
gwendolyn
let
the
go
back
into
place
very
gently
to
prepare
properly
for
her
trip
downstairs
meant
running
the
risk
of
discovery
she
tiptoed
noiselessly
to
the
door
there
she
listened
thomas
deep
voice
was
still
rumbling
on
punctuating
it
regularly
was
a
sniffle
and
the
showed
a
spot
of
glinting
red
jane
hair
gwendolyn
left
the
door
for
the
one
opening
on
the
hall
in
the
hall
were
shaded
lights
light
streamed
up
the
bronze
shaft
gwendolyn
put
her
face
against
the
scrolls
and
peered
down
the
cage
was
far
below
and
all
was
still
the
stairs
wound
their
carpeted
length
before
her
she
slipped
from
one
step
to
another
warily
one
hand
on
the
polished
banisters
to
steady
herself
the
other
carrying
her
slippers
at
the
next
floor
she
stopped
before
crossing
the
hall
to
peer
back
over
a
shoulder
to
peer
ahead
down
the
second
flight
outside
the
high
carved
door
of
the
library
she
stopped
and
put
on
the
slippers
and
she
could
not
forbear
wishing
that
she
knew
which
was
really
her
best
foot
so
that
she
might
put
it
forward
but
there
was
no
time
for
conjectures
she
bore
down
with
both
hands
on
the
huge
knob
and
pressed
her
light
weight
against
the
panels
the
heavy
door
swung
open
she
stole
in
the
library
had
three
windows
that
looked
upon
the
side
street
these
windows
were
all
set
together
the
middle
one
being
built
out
farther
than
the
other
two
so
as
to
form
an
embrasure
over
against
these
windows
in
the
shallow
bow
they
formed
was
a
desk
of
dark
wood
and
it
was
scattered
with
papers
and
books
before
it
sat
her
father
the
moment
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
she
realized
that
she
had
not
come
any
too
soon
for
his
shoulders
were
bent
as
from
a
great
weight
his
head
was
bowed
his
face
was
covered
by
his
hands
she
went
forward
swiftly
when
she
was
between
the
desk
and
the
windows
she
stopped
but
did
not
speak
she
kept
her
gray
eyes
on
those
shielding
hands
presently
he
sighed
straightened
on
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
for
one
instant
gwendolyn
did
not
move
though
her
heart
beat
so
wildly
that
it
stirred
the
lace
ruffles
of
her
then
remembering
dancing
instructions
she
curtsied
a
smile
softened
the
stern
lines
of
her
father
mouth
it
traveled
up
his
cheeks
in
little
ripples
and
half
shut
his
tired
eyes
he
put
out
a
hand
why
hello
daughter
he
said
wearily
but
fondly
she
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
desire
to
throw
out
her
arms
to
him
to
clasp
his
neck
to
cry
oh
daddy
daddy
i
do
want
them
to
hurt
you
but
she
conquered
it
her
underlip
in
her
teeth
and
put
a
small
hand
in
his
outstretched
one
gravely
i
i
heard
the
man
calling
she
began
timidly
and
i
i
thought
maybe
the
bears
down
in
your
street
ah
the
bears
he
gave
a
bitter
laugh
so
miss
royle
had
told
the
truth
the
hand
in
his
tightened
its
hold
have
the
bears
ever
frightened
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
he
did
not
answer
at
once
but
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
her
for
a
full
then
he
nodded
yes
he
said
yes
dear
once
or
twice
she
had
planned
to
spy
out
at
least
a
strap
of
the
harness
he
wore
to
examine
closely
what
sort
of
candles
if
any
he
burned
in
the
seclusion
of
the
library
now
she
forgot
to
do
either
could
not
have
seen
if
she
had
tried
for
her
eyes
were
swimming
blinding
her
she
swayed
nearer
him
if
if
you
take
thomas
along
on
your
car
she
suggested
chokingly
he
hunted
once
and
and
do
need
him
her
father
rose
he
was
not
looking
at
her
but
away
beyond
the
bowed
windows
though
the
shades
of
these
were
drawn
the
hangings
were
in
place
and
no
he
said
hoarsely
not
yet
i
not
through
fighting
them
daddy
fear
for
him
wrung
the
cry
from
her
his
eyes
fell
to
her
upturned
face
and
as
if
he
saw
the
terror
there
he
knelt
suddenly
all
concern
who
told
you
about
the
bears
gwendolyn
with
a
note
of
displeasure
miss
royle
that
was
wrong
she
should
have
done
it
there
are
things
a
little
girl
ca
understand
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
her
brimming
ones
the
next
moment
gwendolyn
oh
where
that
child
the
voice
was
jane
she
was
pounding
her
way
down
the
stairs
before
gwendolyn
could
put
a
finger
to
his
lips
to
plead
for
silence
here
jane
he
called
and
stood
up
once
more
jane
came
in
puffing
with
her
haste
oh
thank
you
sir
she
cried
it
give
me
a
turn
her
stealin
off
like
that
madam
like
her
to
be
up
late
as
she
well
knows
and
i
be
blamed
for
this
sir
though
i
take
pains
to
follow
out
madam
orders
exact
she
seized
gwendolyn
gwendolyn
eyes
dry
now
and
defiant
pulled
back
with
all
the
strength
of
her
slender
arm
oh
she
plead
oh
i
want
to
go
why
why
why
it
was
reproval
but
tender
reproval
mixed
with
mild
amazement
oh
i
want
to
tell
you
something
cried
gwendolyn
let
me
stay
just
a
that
just
the
way
she
acts
sir
whenever
it
mourned
jane
he
leaned
to
lift
gwendolyn
chin
gently
father
thinks
she
better
go
now
he
said
quietly
and
she
not
to
worry
her
blessed
baby
head
any
more
then
he
kissed
her
the
kiss
the
knowledge
that
strife
was
futile
the
sadness
of
parting
these
brought
the
great
sobs
she
went
without
resisting
but
stumbling
a
little
the
back
of
one
hand
was
laid
against
her
streaming
eyes
half
a
flight
up
the
stairs
jane
turned
her
right
about
at
a
bend
then
she
dropped
the
hand
to
look
over
the
banisters
and
through
a
blur
of
tears
saw
her
father
watching
after
her
his
shoulders
against
the
library
door
he
threw
a
kiss
then
another
bend
of
the
staircase
hid
his
upturned
face
chapter
vi
gwendolyn
was
lying
on
her
back
in
the
middle
of
the
nursery
floor
the
skein
of
her
flaxen
hair
streamed
about
her
shoulders
in
tangles
her
head
being
unpillowed
her
face
was
pink
and
pink
too
with
wrath
her
frock
was
crumpled
she
was
kicking
the
rug
with
both
heels
it
was
noon
and
miss
royle
was
having
her
dinner
her
face
usually
so
pale
was
dark
with
anger
held
well
in
check
her
expression
was
that
of
one
who
had
recently
suffered
a
scare
and
her
faded
eyes
shifted
here
and
there
uneasily
thomas
too
looked
apprehensive
as
he
moved
between
table
and
tray
jane
was
just
gone
showing
as
she
disappeared
lips
nervously
pursed
and
a
red
roving
glance
that
betokened
worry
gwendolyn
watching
out
from
under
the
arm
that
rested
across
her
forehead
realized
how
her
last
night
breach
of
authority
had
impressed
each
one
of
them
and
secretly
rejoicing
at
her
triumph
she
kept
up
a
brisk
tattoo
miss
royle
ignored
her
i
take
a
little
more
chocolate
thomas
she
said
with
a
fair
semblance
of
calm
but
cup
and
saucer
rattled
in
her
hand
thomas
too
feigned
indifference
to
the
rat
tat
tat
of
heels
he
bent
above
the
table
attentively
and
to
gwendolyn
was
wafted
down
a
sweet
aroma
thank
you
said
miss
royle
and
cake
splendid
how
did
you
manage
it
a
cut
against
china
she
helped
herself
generously
gwendolyn
fell
silent
to
listen
well
i
have
potter
to
thank
said
thomas
warmly
only
my
own
forethoughtedness
as
you
might
say
the
first
time
i
ever
set
eyes
on
it
i
seen
it
was
the
kind
that
keep
so
from
under
the
shielding
arm
gwendolyn
blinked
with
indignation
birthday
cake
say
miss
royle
chuckled
thomas
replenishing
the
chocolate
cup
that
was
a
whack
you
give
miss
j
last
night
at
once
gwendolyn
forgot
the
wrong
put
upon
her
in
the
matter
of
the
cake
in
astonishment
at
this
new
turn
of
affairs
evidently
miss
royle
and
thomas
were
leagued
against
jane
the
governess
nodded
importantly
she
only
a
cook
before
she
came
here
she
declared
contemptuously
down
at
the
employment
agency
where
madam
got
her
they
said
so
the
common
thing
this
last
was
said
with
much
vindictiveness
following
it
she
proffered
thomas
the
thanks
said
he
i
do
mind
if
i
do
have
a
slice
now
of
a
sudden
wrath
and
resentment
possessed
gwendolyn
sweeping
her
like
a
wave
at
seeing
her
cake
portioned
out
at
having
her
kicking
ignored
at
hearing
these
two
openly
abuse
jane
i
want
some
strawberries
she
stormed
pounding
the
rug
full
force
and
an
egg
i
eat
dry
bread
bang
bang
bang
miss
royle
did
you
ask
to
go
down
to
the
library
she
inquired
she
seemed
totally
undisturbed
yet
her
eyes
glittered
did
she
ask
snorted
thomas
she
gettin
very
forward
she
is
no
you
knew
better
went
on
miss
royle
you
i
would
permit
you
to
bother
your
father
when
he
did
want
you
he
want
me
choking
with
a
sob
think
resumed
the
governess
inflecting
her
tones
eloquently
of
the
fortune
he
spends
on
your
dresses
and
your
pony
and
your
beautiful
car
and
he
hires
all
of
us
she
swept
a
gesture
to
wait
on
you
you
naughty
girl
and
try
to
make
a
little
lady
out
of
you
i
hate
ladies
cried
gwendolyn
rapping
her
heels
by
way
of
emphasis
is
asserted
miss
royle
next
year
i
going
to
like
johnnie
oh
hush

nonsense
commanded
thomas
irritably
miss
royle
glanced
up
at
him
that
will
do
she
snapped
he
bridled
up
what
the
little
imp
needs
is
a
good
paddlin
he
declared
well

nothing

do
with
the
disciplining
of

what
she
needs
all
the
same
the
very
idear
of

bawlin
all
the
mornin
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
i
did
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
contradicted
gwendolyn
i
cried
with
my
mouth
so
the
whole
house
can
hear
continued
thomas
and
beatin
about
the
floor
it
clear
shameful
say
and
enough
to
give
a
sensitive
person
the
nerves
as
i
remarked
to
jane
only
you
remark
too
many
things
to
jane
interposed
the
governess
curtly
now
he
sobered
i
you
ai
displeased
with
me
he
ventured
displeased
repeated
miss
royle
more
than
ever
fretful
oh
thomas

murdering
the
king
english
at
that
gwendolyn
sat
up
shook
back
her
hair
and
raised
a
startled
face
to
the
row
of
toys
in
the
case
murdering
the
english
had
he
to
harm
her
soldier
with
the
scarlet

miss
royle
reminded
thomas
gently
i
says
to
jane
i
says

in
his
place
safe
relieved
gwendolyn
straightened
out
once
more
on
her
whole
lot
of
us

to
be
paid
higher
wages
than
gettin
for
it
a
real
trial
to
have
to
be
under
the
same
roof
with
such
a
provokin
miss
royle
interrupted
by
vigorously
bobbing
her
head
oh
that
i
have
to
make
my
living
in
this
way
she
exclaimed
voice
deep
with
mournfulness
i
rather
wash
dishes
i
rather
scrub
floors
rather
something
in
the
vehemence
or
in
the
cadence
of
miss
declaration
again
gave
gwendolyn
that
sense
of
triumph
with
a
sudden
curling
up
of
her
small
nose
she
giggled
miss
royle
whirled
with
a
rustle
of
silk
skirts
gwendolyn
she
said
threateningly
if
you
going
to
act
like
that
i
shall
know
something
the
matter
with
you
and
i
shall
certainly
call
a
doctor
gwendolyn
lay
very
still
as
thomas
glanced
down
at
her
smirking
exultantly
her
smile
went
and
the
pink
of
wrath
once
more
surged
into
her
face
and
the
doctor
give
nasty
medicine
declared
thomas
or
maybe
he
cut
out
your
appendix
potter
wo
let
him
potter
huh
he
cut
out
your
appendix
and
charge
your
papa
a
thousand
dollars
oh
you
bet
them
that
naughty
always
pays
the
piper
gwendolyn
got
to
her
feet
i
pay
the
piper
she
retorted
going
to
give
all
my
money
to
the
man
of
it
i
like
tauntingly
but
i
hate
you
hate
a
sneak
observed
miss
royle
blandly
the
little
figure
went
rigid
and
i
hate
she
cried
shrilly
then
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
it
was
a
solemn
and
horrified
warning
gwendolyn
turned
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
her
breast
was
heaving
come
back
and
sit
in
this
chair
bade
the
governess
gwendolyn
paused
but
did
not
turn
shall
i
fetch
you
ca
i
even
look
out
of
the
window
burst
forth
gwendolyn
oh
you
you
you
she
yearned
to
say
grass
yet
dared
not
you
mean
her
voice
rose
to
a
scream
miss
royle
stood
up
i
see
that
you
want
to
go
to
bed
she
declared
the
torrent
of
gwendolyn
anger
and
resentment
surged
and
broke
bounds
she
pivoted
arms
tossing
face
aflame
there
were
those
wicked
words
across
the
river
that
each
night
burned
themselves
upon
the
dark
she
had
never
pronounced
them
aloud
before
but
starch
she
shrilled
stamping
a
foot
villa
sites
borax
miss
royle
gave
thomas
a
worried
stare
he
in
turn
fixed
her
with
a
look
of
alarm
so
much
gwendolyn
saw
before
she
flung
herself
down
again
sobbing
aloud
but
tearlessly
her
cheek
upon
the
rug
she
heard
miss
royle
rustle
toward
the
heard
thomas
close
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
there
were
times
the
nursery
had
seen
a
few
when
the
trio
found
it
well
to
let
her
severely
alone
now
only
a
hoarse
lamenting
broke
the
quiet
it
was
an
hour
later
when
some
one
tapped
on
the
door
miss
french
doubtless
since
it
was
her
allotted
time
the
lamentations
swelled
then
and
grew
fainter
only
when
the
last
died
away
on
the
stairs
then
gwendolyn
slept
awakening
she
lay
and
watched
out
through
the
upper
panes
of
the
front
window
across
the
square
of
serene
blue
framed
by
curtains
and
casing
small
clouds
were
drifting
clouds
dazzlingly
white
she
pretended
the
clouds
were
fat
snowy
sheep
that
were
passing
one
by
one
thus
had
snowy
flocks
crossed
above
the
oh
where
was
that
stream
the
glade
through
which
it
flowed
the
shingled
cottage
among
the
trees
with
all
her
heart
gwendolyn
wished
she
were
a
butterfly
suddenly
she
sat
up
she
had
found
her
way
alone
to
the
library
why
not
put
on
hat
and
coat
go
to
johnnie
blake
she
was
at
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
before
she
remembered
the
kidnapers
and
realized
that
she
dared
not
walk
out
alone
but
potter
liked
the
country
besides
he
knew
the
way
she
decided
to
ask
him
to
go
with
her
old
and
stooped
though
he
was
perhaps
she
would
also
take
the
pretty
at
the
corner
and
those
who
were
left
behind
miss
royle
and
thomas
and
jane
would
all
be
sorry
when
she
was
gone
but
let
them
fret
let
them
weep
and
wish
her
back
she
that
moment
she
caught
sight
of
the
photographs
on
the
she
stood
still
to
look
at
them
as
she
looked
both
pictured
faces
gradually
dimmed
for
tears
had
come
at
last
at
the
thought
of
leaving
father
and
mother
quiet
tears
that
flowed
in
erratic
little
s
between
gray
eyes
and
trembling
mouth
how
could
she
forsake
gwendolyn
she
we
just
the
johnnie
blake
pretend
oh
very
well
this
last
with
all
of
miss
precise
intonation
the
heavy
brocade
hangings
were
the
forest
trees
the
piano
was
the
mountain
richly
inlaid
the
table
was
the
cottage
and
she
rolled
it
nearer
the
dull
rose
timber
at
the
side
window
the
rug
was
the
grassy
flowery
glade
its
border
the
stream
that
threaded
the
glade
beyond
the
stream
twisted
an
unpaved
and
carefully
polished
road
the
first
part
of
this
particular
pretend
was
the
drive
to
the
village
carved
and
enameled
and
paneled
with
woven
cane
a
hassock
did
duty
for
a
runabout
that
had
no
top
to
shut
out
the
no
windows
to
bar
the
fragrant
air
in
front
of
the
hassock
a
pillow
did
duty
as
a
stout
dappled
pony
her
father
drove
and
she
sat
beside
him
holding
on
to
the
iron
bar
of
the
runabout
seat
with
one
hand
to
a
corner
of
his
coat
with
the
other
for
not
only
were
the
turns
sharp
but
the
country
road
was
uneven
the
sun
was
just
rising
above
the
forest
and
it
warmed
her
little
back
the
fresh
breeze
caressed
her
cheeks
into
crimson
and
swirled
her
hair
about
the
rim
of
her
hat
that
breeze
brought
with
it
the
perfume
of
opening
flowers
the
fragrance
exhaled
by
the
trees
along
the
way
the
essence
of
the
damp
ground
stirred
by
hoof
and
wheel
gwendolyn
breathed
through
nostrils
swelled
to
their
widest
following
the
drive
to
the
village
came
the
trip
up
the
stream
to
gwendolyn
father
led
the
way
with
basket
and
reel
she
trotted
at
his
heels
and
beside
gwendolyn
trotted
johnnie
blake
the
was
johnnie
his
eyes
were
blue
and
full
of
laughter
his
small
nose
was
as
freckled
as
jane
his
brown
hair
disposed
itself
in
several
rough
heaps
as
if
it
had
been
winnowed
by
a
tiny
whirlwind
said
gwendolyn
curtseying
hello
returned
johnnie
while
gwendolyn
smiled
at
herself
in
the
johnnie
carried
a
long
willow
cut
from
the
reel
he
had
none
nor
basket
and
he
did
not
own
a
belted
of
and
high
buckled
boots
he
wore
a
plaid
gingham
waist
starched
so
stiff
that
its
round
collar
stood
up
and
tickled
his
ears
his
hat
was
of
straw
and
somewhat
ragged
his
brown
jeans
overalls
riveted
and
suspendered
reached
to
bare
ankles
fully
as
brown
the
overalls
were
provided
with
three
pockets
bulging
one
was
his
round
tin
which
was
full
of
worms
are
there
in
these
woods
inquired
gwendolyn
nope
said
johnnie
are
there
bears
nope
are
there
doctors
nope
but
there
snakes
some
oh
i
not
afraid
of
snakes
i
got
one
at
home
it
long
and
black
and
it
got
a
wooden
tongue
to
go
barefoot
oh
i
wish
i
could
here
she
glanced
over
a
shoulder
toward
the
then
toward
the
hall
did
she
dare
well
you
little
yet
explained
johnnie
but
just
you
wait
till
you
grow
up
are
are
a
trifle
doubtfully
of
i
grown
up
why
i
whereat
she
strode
up
and
down
hands
on
hips
in
feeble
imitation
of
johnnie
but
here
the
inclination
for
further
died
utterly
at
a
point
where
usually
johnnie
threw
back
his
head
with
a
triumphant
laugh
gave
a
leap
into
the
air
from
the
top
of
the
nursery
table
caught
the
lower
branch
of
a
tall
slim
tree
the
chandelier
and
swung
himself
to
and
fro
with
joyous
abandon
for
gwendolyn
suddenly
remembered
the
cruel
truth
borne
out
by
the
on
the
and
instead
of
climbing
upon
the
table
she
went
to
stand
in
front
of
her
i
was
seven
my
last
birthday
she
murmured
looking
up
at
the
calendar
seven
and
and
yet
everything
was
just
the
same
she
went
to
the
front
window
and
knelt
on
the
cushioned
seat
across
the
river
red
smoke
was
pouring
up
from
those
chimneys
on
the
water
edge
that
were
assuredly
a
mile
high
red
smoke
meant
that
evening
was
approaching
jane
would
enter
soon
with
two
in
the
nursery
the
advantage
was
for
her
who
did
not
have
to
make
the
overtures
of
peace
she
turned
her
back
to
the
room
jane
came
she
drew
the
heavy
curtains
at
the
side
window
and
busied
herself
in
the
vicinity
of
the
bed
moving
about
quietly
saying
not
a
word
presently
she
went
out
gwendolyn
faced
round
the
bed
was
arranged
for
the
night
at
its
head
on
the
small
table
was
a
glass
of
milk
a
sandwich
a
cup
of
broth
a
plate
of
cooked
fruit
the
western
sky
faded
to
gray
to
deep
blue
to
jade
the
river
flowed
jade
beneath
along
it
the
lights
sprang
up
then
came
the
stars
gwendolyn
worked
at
the
buttons
of
her
slippers
the
tears
were
falling
again
but
not
tears
of
anger
or
resentment
only
of
loneliness
of
yearning
the
little
frock
fastened
down
the
front
she
undid
it
weeping
softly
the
while
found
her
put
it
on
and
climbed
into
bed
the
food
was
close
at
hand
she
did
not
touch
it
she
was
not
hungry
only
worn
with
her
combat
she
lay
back
among
the
pillows
and
as
she
looked
up
at
the
stars
each
sent
out
gay
little
flashes
of
light
to
every
side
oh
she
mourned
everybody
hates
me
everybody
hates
me
then
came
a
comforting
thought
she
would
play
the
dearest
pretend
it
was
easy
to
make
believe
that
a
girlish
figure
was
seated
in
the
dark
beside
the
bed
that
a
tender
face
was
bending
down
a
gentle
hand
touching
the
troubled
forehead
stroking
the
tangled
hair
oh
i
want
you
all
the
time
and
i
want
my
precious
baby
how
much
do
you
love
me
love
you
oh
big
as
the
sky
dear
may
i
eat
at
the
table
all
the
time
sweetheart
goody
and
we
just
let
miss
royle
eat
with
jane
and
she
caught
a
stealthy
rustle
rustle
from
the
direction
of
the
hall
she
spoke
more
low
then
but
continued
to
chatter
her
loving
confidential
and
consoling
finally
she
plead
will
you
please
sing
she
sang
her
voice
was
husky
from
crying
more
than
once
it
quavered
and
broke
but
the
song
was
one
she
had
heard
in
the
long
raftered
at
johnnie
blake
and
it
soothed
oh
it
is
not
while
beauty
and
youth
are
thine
and
thy
cheek
is
unstained
by
a
tear
that
the
fervor
and
faith
of
a
soul
can
be
it
grew
faint
it
ended
in
a
long
sigh
then
one
small
hand
in
the
gentle
grasp
of
another
she
slept
chapter
vii
miss
royle
looked
sober
as
she
sipped
her
and
she
cut
off
the
top
of
her
breakfast
egg
as
noiselessly
as
possible
her
directions
to
thomas
she
or
merely
signaled
them
by
a
wave
of
her
now
and
then
she
glanced
across
the
room
to
the
bed
then
she
beamed
fondly
as
for
thomas
he
fairly
stole
from
tray
to
table
from
table
to
tray
his
face
all
concern
occasionally
if
his
glance
followed
miss
royle
he
smiled
a
broad
sympathetic
smile
and
jane
was
subdued
and
solicitous
she
sat
beside
the
bed
holding
a
small
hand
which
from
time
to
time
she
patted
encouragingly
after
the
storm
calm
the
more
tempestuous
the
storm
the
more
perfect
the
calm
this
was
the
rule
of
the
nursery
gwendolyn
lying
among
the
pillows
wished
she
could
always
feel
weak
and
listless
it
made
everyone
so
kind
thomas
said
miss
royle
as
she
folded
her
napkin
and
rustled
to
her
feet
you
may
call
up
the
riding
school
and
say
that
miss
gwendolyn
will
not
ride
yes
and
jane
you
may
go
out
for
the
morning
i
shall
stay
here
thanks
acknowledged
jane
in
a
tone
quite
unusual
for
her
she
did
not
rise
however
but
waited
striving
to
catch
thomas
eye
and
thomas
went
on
the
governess
when
would
like
an
hour
thomas
advanced
with
a
bow
of
appreciation
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
miss
royle
said
he
i
have
a
bit
of
an
airin
directly
after
supper
this
evenin
jane
glared
very
well
miss
royle
rustled
toward
the
taking
a
survey
of
herself
in
the
as
she
went
jane
she
added
you
will
be
free
to
go
in
half
an
hour
she
threw
gwendolyn
a
loud
kiss
thomas
was
directing
his
attention
to
the
clearing
of
the
the
moment
the
door
closed
behind
the
governess
jane
shot
up
from
her
chair
and
advanced
upon
him
you
ai
treatin
me
fair
she
charged
speaking
low
but
breathing
fast
you
ai
takin
your
hours
off
duty
along
with
me
no
more
you
givin
me
the
cold
shoulder
at
that
gwendolyn
turned
her
head
to
look
of
late
she
had
heard
not
a
few
times
of
thomas
cold
shoulder
this
in
heated
encounters
between
him
and
jane
she
wondered
which
of
his
shoulders
was
the
cold
one
thomas
lifted
his
upper
lip
in
a
sneer
indeed
he
replied
i
not
treatin
you
fair
well
with
meaning
i
did
think
you
was
botherin
your
head
about
anybody
except
a
certain
policeman
back
jerked
jane
chin
ca
i
have
a
gentleman
friend
she
demanded
defensively
ha
ha
gentleman
friend
then
addressing
no
one
in
particular
my
but
do
a
uniform
take
a
woman
eye
why
thomas
it
was
a
sorrowful
protest
you
misjudge
you
really
so
far
there
was
no
fresh
element
in
the
misunderstanding
thus
the
two
argued
time
and
again
gwendolyn
almost
knew
their
quarrel
by
heart
but
now
thomas
came
round
upon
jane
with
a
snarl
you
not
me
he
declared
do
you
think
i
know
that
policeman
heels
over
head
he
shook
his
at
her
over
head
then
seizing
the
tray
and
swinging
it
up
he
stalked
out
jane
fell
to
pacing
the
floor
her
reddish
eyes
roved
angrily
heels
over
head
gwendolyn
pondering
now
watched
the
nurse
now
looked
across
to
where
on
its
shelf
was
poised
the
toy
somersault
man
if
one
of
the
uniformed
men
she
dreaded
was
heels
over
head
but
jane
well
well
i
saw
the
walking
on
his
feet
hush
your
silly
talk
gwendolyn
hushed
her
gray
eyes
wistful
her
mouth
drooping
the
morning
had
been
so
peaceful
now
jane
had
spoken
the
first
rough
word
peace
returned
with
miss
royle
who
came
in
with
the
morning
paper
dismissed
jane
and
settled
down
in
the
upholstered
chair
spectacles
on
nose
the
brocade
hangings
of
the
front
window
were
only
partly
drawn
between
them
gwendolyn
made
out
more
of
those
fat
sheep
straying
down
the
azure
field
of
the
sky
she
lay
very
still
and
counted
them
and
counting
slept
but
restlessly
with
eyes
only
and
nervous
starts
awakening
at
noon
the
listlessness
was
gone
and
she
felt
stronger
her
eyes
were
bright
too
there
was
a
faint
color
in
cheeks
and
lips
miss
royle
yes
darling
the
governess
leaned
forward
attentively
i
can
understand
why
you
call
thomas
a
footman
it
he
runs
around
so
much
on
his
feet
you
better
said
miss
royle
she
turned
her
paper
inside
out
but
one
day
you
said
he
was
all
ears
and
gwendolyn
miss
royle
stared
down
over
her
glasses
never
repeat
what
you
hear
me
say
love
it
tattling
and
tattling
is
now
what
can
i
give
you
gwendolyn
wanted
a
drink
of
water
when
thomas
appeared
with
the
he
gave
an
impressive
wag
of
the
head
do
you
think
i
got
for
you
he
asked
while
miss
royle
propped
gwendolyn
to
a
sitting
position
gwendolyn
did
not
try
to
guess
she
was
not
interested
she
had
no
appetite
thomas
brought
forward
a
silver
dish
it
a
bird
he
announced
and
lifted
the
cover
gwendolyn
looked
it
was
a
small
bird
richly
browned
a
tiny
sprig
of
parsley
garnished
it
on
either
side
a
ribbon
of
bacon
lay
in
crisp
flutings
across
it
its
short
round
legs
were
on
the
end
of
each
was
a
paper
frill
it
look
delicious
said
thomas
warmly
do
it
tempt
but
gwendolyn
regarded
it
without
enthusiasm
what
kind
of
a
bird
is
it
she
asked
thomas
displayed
a
second
dish
bermuda
potatoes
the
size
of
her
own
small
fist
who
knows
said
he
it
might
be
a
robin
it
might
be
a
plover
it
might
be
a
quail
it
might
be
a
a
said
gwendolyn
she
poked
the
bird
with
a
fork
not
likely
declared
thomas
gwendolyn
turned
away
ai
it
to
your
likin
asked
thomas
surprised
he
did
not
take
the
plate
at
once
in
his
usual
fashion
i
i
do
want
anything
she
declared
oh
but
maybe
you
fancy
an
egg
gwendolyn
took
a
glass
of
water
it
just
as
well
said
miss
royle
when
she
resigned
her
place
presently
she
talked
to
jane
in
undertones
so
that
gwendolyn
could
hear
only
disconnectedly
think
it
would
be
the
safest
thing
she
gets
any
worse
never
do
jane
find
out
by
themselves
she
wo
be
home
till
late
some
grand
affair
but
he
though
of
course
i
sorry
to
have
to
the
moment
miss
royle
was
well
away
jane
had
a
plan
think
gittin
on
so
fine
that
you
can
hop
up
and
dress
she
declared
noting
how
the
gray
eyes
sparkled
and
how
pink
were
the
round
spots
on
gwendolyn
cheeks
gwendolyn
had
nothing
to
say
jane
ran
to
the
wardrobe
and
took
out
a
dress
it
was
a
new
one
of
wool
and
on
a
sleeve
as
well
as
on
the
corners
of
the
sailor
collar
and
the
tips
of
the
broad
tie
scarlet
anchors
were
embroidered
gwendolyn
smiled
but
it
was
not
the
anchors
that
charmed
forth
the
smile
it
was
a
pocket
set
like
a
shield
on
the
blouse
an
adorable
oh
she
cried
did
they
make
me
that
pocket
jane
how
sweet
one
two
three
said
jane
briskly
and
we
have
this
on
see
by
the
clock
how
quick
you
can
jump
into
it
the
clock
was
a
familiar
method
of
inducing
gwendolyn
to
do
hastily
something
she
had
not
thought
of
doing
at
all
she
shook
her
head
why
it
do
you
pettie
this
coaxingly
it
too
warm
to
dress
said
gwendolyn
jane
flung
the
garment
back
into
the
wardrobe
without
troubling
to
hang
it
up
and
banged
the
wardrobe
door
but
she
did
not
again
broach
the
subject
of
getting
up
a
hint
of
uneasiness
betrayed
itself
in
her
manner
she
took
a
chair
by
the
bed
gwendolyn
whole
face
was
gradually
taking
on
a
deep
flush
for
those
flaming
spots
on
her
cheeks
were
spreading
to
throat
and
temples
to
her
very
hair
she
kept
her
hands
in
constant
motion
next
the
small
tongue
began
to
babble
uninterruptedly
it
was
the
overlively
talking
that
made
jane
certain
that
gwendolyn
was
she
leaned
to
feel
of
the
busy
hands
the
throbbing
forehead
then
she
hastily
telephoned
thomas
have
we
any
more
of
that
quietin
medicine
she
asked
as
he
opened
the
door
it
all
gone
why
the
two
forgot
their
differences
and
bent
over
gwendolyn
she
smiled
up
and
nodded
all
the
clouds
in
the
sky
are
filled
with
wind
she
declared
like
automobile
tires
are
i
know
once
i
put
a
pin
in
one
and
the
wind
blew
right
out
i
the
clouds
in
the
south
hold
the
south
wind
and
the
clouds
in
the
north
hold
the
north
wind
and
the
clouds
jane
said
thomas
we
got
to
have
a
doctor
gwendolyn
heard
she
saw
jane
spring
to
the
telephone
the
next
instant
with
a
piercing
scream
that
sent
her
canary
fluttering
to
the
top
of
its
cage
she
flung
herself
sidewise
jane
oh
do
jane
he
kill
me
jane
fell
back
and
caught
gwendolyn
in
her
arms
the
little
figure
was
all
both
small
hands
were
beating
the
air
in
wild
protest
jane
oh
i
be
good
i
be
good
she
hid
her
face
against
the
nurse
shuddering
but
you
sick
lovie
and
a
doctor
would
make
you
well
there
there
listen
to
jane
dearie
thomas
laid
an
anxious
hand
on
the
yellow
head
the
doctor
wo
hurt
you
he
declared
he
only
gives
anyhow
she
flung
herself
back
upon
the
bed
catching
at
the
pillows
as
if
to
hide
beneath
them
writhing
pitifully
moaning
beseeching
with
terrified
eyes
jane
and
thomas
stared
helplessly
at
each
other
their
faces
guilty
and
frightened
dearie
cried
jane
hush
and
we
wo
oh
thomas
i
fairly
distracted
pettie
we
have
the
doctor
gradually
gwendolyn
quieted
then
carefully
and
by
degrees
jane
approached
the
matter
of
medical
aid
in
a
new
way
we
just
telephone
she
declared
we
wont
let
any
old
doctor
come
here
not
a
of
it
we
ask
him
to
send
something
is
all
right
darlin
reluctantly
gwendolyn
yielded
the
medicine
be
awful
nasty
she
faltered
to
that
jane
made
no
reply
her
every
freckle
was
standing
out
clearly
her
reddish
eyes
bulged
she
hunted
a
number
in
the
with
fumbling
fingers
after
which
she
held
the
receiver
to
her
ear
with
a
shaking
hand
everything
goin
wrong
she
mourned
huddled
into
a
little
ball
and
still
as
a
frightened
bird
gwendolyn
listened
to
the
message
hello
hello
is
this
the
doctor
speakin
oh
this
is
miss
gwendolyn
nurse
sir
sir

miss
gwendolyn

little

soothin
she

like
that
all
yes

and
wakeful
a
little
hysterical
yesterday

thomas
in
a
low
voice
a
little
hysterical
yesterday

on
jane
yes

by
messenger
i
be
careful
sir
thank
you
sir
jane
and
thomas
combined
to
make
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
less
dull
one
by
one
the
favorite
toys
came
down
from
the
second
shelf
and
a
miniature
circus
took
place
on
the
rug
beside
the
bed
a
circus
in
which
each
toy
played
a
part
gwendolyn
fear
was
charmed
away
she
laughed
and
drank
copious
draughts
of
water
delicious
bubbling
water
that
thomas
poured
from
tall
bottles
jane
had
her
own
supper
beside
the
bed
coffee
and
a
sandwich
only
gwendolyn
still
had
no
appetite
but
seemed
almost
her
usual
self
once
more
so
much
so
that
when
she
asked
questions
jane
was
cross
and
counseled
immediate
sleep
but
i
not
a
bit
sleepy
declared
gwendolyn
it
be
moonlight
after
while
jane
may
i
look
out
at
the
roofs
you
may
stop
your
botherin
retorted
jane
and
make
up
your
mind
to
go
to
sleep
you
give
me
a
awful
day
now
try
just
forty
winks
why
do
you
always
say
forty
inquired
gwendolyn
could
i
take
after
supper
came
the
medicine
a
dark
liquid
gwendolyn
eyed
it
anxiously
thomas
was
gone
jane
opened
the
bottle
and
measured
a
teaspoonful
into
a
do
i
have
to
take
it
now
asked
gwendolyn
you
wake
up
as
good
as
new
asserted
jane
she
touched
her
tongue
with
the
spoon
then
smacked
her
lips
why
dearie
it
she
was
interrupted
from
the
direction
of
the
side
window
there
came
a
burst
of
instrumental
music
with
it
singing
the
words
of
a
waltz
from
a
popular
opera
blended
a
thin
cracked
voice
before
jane
could
put
out
a
restraining
hand
gwendolyn
bounced
to
her
knees
oh
it
the
old
man
she
cried
it
the
old
man
oh
where
some
money
i
want
to
give
him
some
money
jane
threw
up
both
hands
wildly
oh
did
i
ever
have
such
luck
she
exclaimed
then
between
her
teeth
and
pressing
gwendolyn
back
upon
the
pillows
you
lay
down
or
i
shake
you
oh
please
let
him
stay
just
this
time
begged
gwendolyn
i
like
him
jane
i
stay
him
promised
jane
grimly
she
marched
to
the
side
window
threw
up
the
sash
and
leaned
out
here
you
she
called
down
roughly
you
git
oh
jane
plead
gwendolyn
the
thin
cracked
voice
fell
silent
the
waltz
slowed
its
tempo
then
came
to
a
gasping
stop
how
a
body
to
git
a
child
asleep
with
that
old
wheeze
of
yours
goin
demanded
jane
we
do
you
here
move
along
he
could
play
me
to
sleep
protested
gwendolyn
a
reply
to
jane
order
was
shrilled
up
something
defiant
he
only
excite
you
darlin
declared
jane
she
was
on
her
knees
at
the
window
and
turned
her
head
to
speak
i
ca
have
that
rumpus
in
the
street
with
you
so
nervous
gwendolyn
sighed
take
your
medicine
dearie
went
on
jane
she
stayed
where
she
was
promptly
gwendolyn
sat
up
and
reached
for
the
glass
to
hold
it
to
shake
it
about
and
potter
in
the
strange
liquid
with
a
spoon
would
be
some
compensation
for
having
to
drink
it
if
that
mean
old
creature
did
make
faces
grumbled
jane
she
was
leaning
forward
to
look
out
did
he
make
faces
jane
asked
gwendolyn
were
they
nice
ones
she
lifted
the
glass
to
take
a
whiff
of
its
contents
i
like
to
see
him
make
faces
she
put
the
spoon
into
jane
then
let
the
medicine
run
up
the
side
of
the
glass
until
it
was
almost
to
her
lips
she
tasted
it
it
tasted
good
she
hesitated
a
second
then
drained
the
glass
the
street
was
quiet
jane
rose
to
her
feet
and
came
over
did
you
do
as
i
said
she
asked
yes
jane
now
you
jane
picked
up
the
glass
looked
into
it
then
at
gwendolyn
honest
yes
every
sip
jane
held
her
with
doubting
eyes
i
do
believe
it
but
i
jane
bent
down
to
the
cup
sniffed
it
then
smelled
of
the
glass
gwendolyn
she
said
solemnly
i
know
you
did
take
your
medicine
you
poured
it
into
this
cup
but
i
i
jane
pointed
an
accusing
finger
how
you
demanded
gwendolyn
you
were
looking
at
the
brick
house
i
got
eyes
in
the
back
of
my
head
and
i
seen
you
when
i
was
lookin
straight
the
other
way
laughed
gwendolyn
skeptically
they
hid
by
my
braids
went
on
jane
but
they
there
and
i
seen
you
throw
away
that
medicine
you
bad
girl
again
she
leaned
to
examine
the
miss
royle
said
you
had
two
faces
admitted
gwendolyn
she
stared
hard
at
the
coiled
braids
on
the
back
of
jane
head
the
braids
were
pinned
close
together
no
pair
of
eyes
was
visible
jane
straightened
resolutely
seized
the
and
the
spoon
poured
out
a
second
dose
and
proffered
it
come
now
she
said
firmly
you
ai
to
git
ahead
of
me
with
your
cuteness
take
this
and
go
to
sleep
that
moment
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
from
the
street
now
cried
jane
triumphantly
the
policeman
right
here
i
can
call
him
up
whenever
i
like
gwendolyn
drank
jane
tossed
the
spoon
aside
corked
the
bottle
and
went
back
to
the
open
window
you
go
to
sleep
she
commanded
gwendolyn
lying
flat
was
murmuring
to
herself
how
funny
she
said
now
do
let
me
hear
another
word
out
of
you
warned
jane
gwendolyn
turned
her
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
a
great
light
of
some
kind
was
flaming
against
her
eyes
a
light
shot
through
and
through
with
black
whirling
balls
where
did
it
come
from
it
stayed
and
grew
her
eyes
widened
with
wonderment
a
smile
curved
her
lips
then
suddenly
she
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
threw
out
both
arms
and
gave
a
little
choking
cry
chapter
viii
it
was
a
cry
of
amazement
for
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
she
did
not
have
time
to
think
how
it
had
happened
she
found
herself
and
and
standing
alone
gazing
about
her
the
open
air
but
there
were
no
high
buildings
on
any
side
no
people
passing
to
and
fro
no
flashing
by
and
the
grass
underfoot
was
not
the
grass
of
a
lawn
evenly
cut
and
flowerless
it
was
tall
so
that
it
brushed
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
not
the
sky
of
the
city
distant
and
marbled
with
streaks
of
smoke
it
was
close
and
clear
starless
too
and
no
moon
hung
upon
it
yet
though
it
was
night
there
was
light
everywhere
warm
glowing
roseate
by
that
radiant
glow
she
saw
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
trees
some
were
tall
and
slender
and
others
were
low
and
thick
of
trunk
but
with
the
wide
shapely
spread
of
the
great
banyan
in
her
geography
and
towering
above
the
others
were
the
giants
of
that
forest
unevenly
branched
misshapen
aslant
and
rugged
with
burls
is
is
this
the
park
she
said
aloud
still
looking
around
or
or
the
woods
across
the
river
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
paved
walk
such
as
traced
patterns
through
the
park
nor
of
a
chimney
to
mark
the
whereabouts
of
a
house
behind
her
the
ground
sloped
gently
up
to
a
wooded
rise
in
front
of
her
it
sloped
as
gently
down
to
the
edge
of
a
narrow
noisy
mountain
stream
why
i
at
johnnie
blake
she
cried
then
glanced
over
a
shoulder
cautiously
if
this
were
indeed
the
place
she
had
longed
to
revisit
it
would
be
advisable
to
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
lest
someone
should
hear
her
and
straightway
come
to
take
her
home
still
watching
backward
apprehensively
she
pushed
through
the
grass
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
the
moment
she
reached
it
she
knew
that
it
was
not
the
along
which
she
had
wandered
while
her
father
fished
it
was
in
fact
not
ordinary
water
at
all
but
something
lighter
more
sparkling
with
color
swifter
and
louder
it
effervesced
so
that
a
creamy
mist
lay
along
its
surface
this
the
smoke
of
bursting
bubbles
it
was
like
the
bottled
water
she
drank
at
her
nursery
meals
hands
clasped
she
leaned
to
stare
down
is
it
she
exclaimed
half
under
her
breath
a
voice
answered
her
from
close
at
hand
it
was
a
thin
cracked
voice
this
is
where
they
get
their
it
said
she
turned
and
saw
him
he
was
a
queer
little
old
gentleman
with
grizzled
whiskers
a
ragged
hat
and
baggy
trousers
his
eyes
were
round
and
black
under
his
brows
which
were
square
and
and
not
unlike
a
certain
new
that
jane
wielded
of
a
morning
across
gwendolyn
small
over
one
shoulder
by
a
strap
hung
a
dark
box
by
a
piece
of
old
carpet
in
one
hand
he
held
a
huge
curved
knife
though
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
him
at
johnnie
blake
and
though
the
curved
knife
was
in
pattern
the
true
type
of
a
kidnaper
weapon
and
the
look
out
of
those
round
dark
eyes
as
he
strode
toward
her
was
not
at
all
friendly
she
did
not
scamper
away
she
waited
her
heart
beating
hard
when
he
halted
she
curtsied
i
i
always
wondered
about
she
faltered
trying
to
smile
but
when
i
asked
um
he
grunted
then
with
a
sidewise
jerk
of
the
head
take
a
drink
she
lifted
eager
eyes
all
i
to
she
he
nodded
sip
lap
tipple
oo
fairly
beaming
with
delight
she
knelt
down
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
could
have
all
the
she
wanted
first
she
put
the
tip
of
one
finger
into
the
rushing
sparkle
slowly
to
lengthen
out
her
joy
next
with
a
little
laugh
she
sank
her
whole
hand
bubbles
formed
upon
it
all
sizes
of
them
standing
out
like
dewdrops
upon
leaves
the
bubbles
cooled
and
tempted
her
thirst
with
a
deep
breath
she
bent
forward
until
her
red
mouth
touched
the
shimmering
surface
thus
lying
prone
with
arms
spread
wide
she
drank
deep
of
the
flow
when
she
straightened
and
sat
back
upon
her
heels
she
made
an
astonishing
discovery
the
trees
that
studded
the
slope
were
not
covered
with
leaves
like
ordinary
trees
each
branched
to
hold
lights
myriads
of
lights
some
of
these
shone
steadily
others
burned
with
a
hissing
sound
others
were
silent
enough
but
rose
and
fell
jumped
and
flickered
it
was
these
countless
lights
that
illumed
the
forest
like
a
pink
sun
she
rose
there
was
wonder
in
the
gray
eyes
are
these
christmas
trees
she
said
where
am
i
you
had
your
he
answered
shortly
you
ought
to
know
yes
i
i
ought
to
know
but
i
do
he
grunted
i
she
ventured
timidly
that
nobody
ever
answers
questions
here
either
he
looked
uncomfortable
yes
he
retorted
does
then
advancing
an
eager
step
why
do
he
mopped
his
forehead
well
well
if
i
must
i
must
this
is
where
all
the
lights
go
when
they
put
out
at
night
oh
and
now
as
she
glanced
from
tree
to
tree
she
saw
that
what
he
had
said
was
true
for
the
greater
part
of
the
lights
were
electric
bulbs
while
many
were
and
a
few
still
marveling
her
look
chanced
to
fall
upon
herself
and
she
found
that
she
was
not
wearing
a
despised
muslin
frock
her
dress
was
gingham
an
adorable
plaid
with
long
sleeves
and
a
low
down
on
the
right
side
you
darling
she
exclaimed
happily
and
thrust
a
hand
into
the
pocket
i
guess
they
made
it
next
she
looked
down
at
her
feet
and
could
scarcely
believe
she
had
on
no
stockings
she
did
not
even
have
on
slippers
was
barefoot
then
still
fearful
that
there
was
some
mistake
about
it
all
she
put
a
hand
to
her
head
and
found
her
gone
in
its
place
making
a
small
floppy
double
knot
was
a
length
of
black
oh
goody
she
cried
um
grunted
the
little
old
gentleman
and
you
can
play
in
the
water
if
you
like
to
that
needed
no
urging
she
was
face
about
on
the
instant
from
the
standpoint
of
messing
the
was
ideal
it
brawled
around
flat
rocks
set
at
convenient
from
one
another
she
leaped
promptly
to
one
of
these
and
sopped
her
handkerchief
it
circled
into
pools
just
shallow
enough
for
wading
and
from
the
pools
it
spread
out
thinly
to
thread
the
grass
thus
giving
her
an
opportunity
for
squashing
a
diverting
pastime
consisting
in
squirting
equal
parts
of
water
and
soil
ticklishly
through
the
toes
she
hopped
from
rock
to
pool
she
splashed
from
pool
to
long
wet
muddy
grass
it
was
the
that
brought
the
realization
of
all
her
new
the
being
out
of
doors
and
plainly
clad
free
from
the
espionage
of
a
governess
away
from
the
tyranny
of
a
barefoot
and
chief
blessing
of
all
forgetting
the
little
old
gentleman
in
a
sudden
excess
of
glee
she
seized
a
stick
and
bestrode
it
seized
another
and
belabored
the
quarters
of
a
stout
dappled
pony
pranced
reared
kicked
up
her
wet
feet
shied
wildly
then
both
sticks
cast
aside
she
began
to
dance
at
first
with
deliberation
holding
out
the
gingham
dress
at
either
side
and
mincing
through
the
steps
taught
by
monsieur
tellegen
but
gradually
she
forsook
rhythm
and
measure
capering
ceased
the
dance
became
fast
and
furious
hallooing
she
raced
hither
and
thither
among
the
trees
tossing
her
arms
darting
down
at
the
flowers
and
flinging
them
high
swishing
her
yellow
hair
from
side
to
side
leaping
exultantly
toward
the
lights
pivoting
suddenly
she
found
that
she
was
dancing
to
music
not
the
laboriously
strummed
notes
of
a
piano
such
as
were
beaten
out
by
the
miss
brown
not
the
clamorous
deafening
tuneless
efforts
of
an
orchestra
this
was
music
inviting
inspiring
heavenly
it
was
a
she
halted
he
was
playing
turning
the
crank
with
a
swift
steady
motion
his
ragged
hat
tipped
to
one
side
now
she
understood
the
box
hanging
from
its
strap
she
danced
up
to
him
and
held
out
a
hand
why
you
the
man
she
panted
breathlessly
and
you
got
here
as
quick
as
i
did
he
stopped
playing
i
the
man
when
i
in
town
he
corrected
here
in
the
land
of
the
lights
i
the
the
she
looked
at
him
with
new
interest
why
of
course
you
are
she
acknowledged
sometimes
you
make
in
town
sometimes
in
town
i
make
an
ugly
one
he
retorted
whereupon
he
shouldered
the
grasped
the
curved
knife
and
started
away
as
he
walked
he
called
aloud
to
every
side
like
a
huckster
here
where
you
get
your
ears
sharpened
he
sang
sharpened
sharpened
edges
taken
off
of
tongues
she
trotted
beside
him
head
up
gray
eyes
wide
lips
parted
he
was
ascending
a
gentle
rise
toward
a
low
hill
not
far
distant
as
she
drew
away
from
the
stream
and
the
glade
she
heard
from
somewhere
far
behind
a
shrill
voice
it
called
a
name
a
name
strangely
familiar
she
paid
no
heed
at
the
summit
of
the
little
hill
under
some
trees
he
paused
and
waved
the
kidnaper
knife
in
circles
to
sharpen
he
shrilled
again
to
sharpen
edges
taken
off
of
tongues
she
smiled
up
at
him
engagingly
noting
how
his
gray
hair
hung
over
the
back
of
his
collar
she
felt
no
fear
of
him
whatever
i
think
nice
she
announced
presently
i
so
glad
i
can
look
straight
at
you
i
did
know
you
your
voice
is
different
and
i
never
seen
you
before
when
i
was
looking
at
you
he
had
been
ignoring
her
but
now
was
my
fault
that
we
did
meet
face
to
face
he
retorted
though
his
voice
was
still
cross
his
round
bright
eyes
were
almost
kind
if
you
remember
i
often
came
under
your
window
and
i
threw
you
money
she
answered
nodding
brightly
i
wanted
to
come
down
and
talk
to
you
oh
lots
of
times
only
at
that
he
relented
altogether
and
reaching
out
shook
hands
cordially
would
you
like
said
he
to
have
a
look
at
my
establishment
he
jerked
a
thumb
over
a
shoulder
here
where
i
make
faces
in
the
city
she
had
seen
many
wonderful
shops
catching
glimpses
of
some
from
the
little
window
of
her
car
visiting
others
with
miss
royle
or
jane
among
the
former
were
those
fascinating
ones
usually
low
of
ceiling
and
dark
with
where
grimy
men
in
leather
aprons
tried
shoes
on
horses
and
those
horrifying
places
past
which
she
always
drove
with
closed
eyes
places
where
scraped
white
and
head
downward
hung
little
pigs
pitiful
husks
of
what
they
once
had
been
flanked
on
either
hand
by
turkeys
with
poor
glazed
eyes
and
once
she
had
seen
a
wonderful
shop
in
which
men
were
sawing
out
flat
pieces
of
stone
and
writing
words
on
them
with
chisels
but
this
shop
of
the
was
the
most
interesting
of
all
it
occupied
a
square
of
ground
a
square
as
broad
as
the
nursery
and
curiously
enough
like
the
nursery
it
had
marking
it
off
all
the
way
around
its
outer
edge
a
border
of
flowers
it
was
shaded
by
one
huge
tree
explained
the
little
old
gentleman
and
the
lights
do
tell
me
she
cried
i
know
they
lime
lights
these
made
the
shop
exceedingly
bright
full
in
their
glare
neatly
disposed
were
two
tables
a
squat
stool
and
a
high
broad
the
seated
himself
on
the
stool
at
one
of
the
tables
and
began
working
industriously
but
gwendolyn
could
only
stand
and
stare
about
her
so
amazed
that
she
was
dumb
for
in
front
of
the
little
old
gentleman
and
spread
handily
were
ears
and
eyes
noses
and
mouths
cheeks
and
chins
and
foreheads
and
upon
the
pendant
were
toupees
and
and
mustaches
puffs
transformations
and
goatees
and
one
coronet
braid
a
red
one
glossy
and
thick
and
handsome
the
also
held
an
assortment
of
tongues
long
and
scarlet
these
a
score
in
all
were
ranged
in
a
shining
row
and
underneath
them
was
a
sign
which
bore
this
announcement
in
all
languages
dead
or
modern
chic
if
seven
are
purchased
at
gwendolyn
clapped
her
hands
oo
how
she
exclaimed
finding
her
voice
again
quite
so
said
the
little
old
gentleman
shoving
away
a
tray
of
chins
and
cheeks
and
reaching
for
a
forehead
welcome
convenient
and
satisfactory
she
saw
her
opportunity
please
she
began
i
like
to
buy
six
she
counted
on
her
fingers
i
have
a
french
tongue
a
german
tongue
a
greek
tongue
a
latin
tongue
and
later
though
if
you
do
happen
to
have
on
hand
a
spanish
and
an
italian
then
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
i
glad
i
saw
these
she
added
they
save
me
a
lot
of
work
and
they
helped
me
about
a
i
looked
for
in
my
big
dictionary
and
it
said
whip
but
could
see
how
anybody
could
whip
anybody
else
with
a
now
though
the
nodded
just
wait
till
you
see
the
english
he
bragged
the
king
english
will
i
see
him
likely
to
he
answered
selecting
an
eye
he
had
all
his
eyes
about
him
in
a
circle
each
looking
as
natural
as
life
there
were
blue
eyes
and
brown
eyes
hazel
eyes
and
ah
she
exclaimed
suddenly
i
remember
it
was
who
gave
the
policeman
a
black
eye
one
black
eye
he
answered
chuckling
as
he
poked
about
in
a
pile
of
noses
and
selected
a
one
yes
yes
and
recently
i
made
a
lovely
blue
pair
for
a
child
who
cried
her
own
eyes
out
she
assented
she
had
heard
of
just
such
a
case
once
i
saw
some
eyes
in
a
she
confided
it
was
a
shop
where
you
could
buy
spectacles
he
wagged
his
beard
proudly
i
made
every
of
he
boasted
oh
yes
indeed
and
polished
away
at
the
tip
of
the
large
nose
she
considered
for
a
moment
i
glad
i
know
she
said
gravely
i
wanted
to
awful
much
after
that
she
studied
the
for
a
time
and
presently
discovered
that
a
second
supply
of
eyes
was
displayed
there
being
set
in
it
as
jewels
are
set
in
brooches
she
pointed
what
kind
are
those
he
looked
surprised
at
the
question
the
is
the
rear
wall
of
my
shop
said
he
and
those
eyes
are
she
flushed
with
pleasure
that
what
i
thought
she
declared
she
began
to
walk
up
and
down
one
hand
in
the
to
make
sure
it
was
really
there
for
this
was
all
too
good
to
be
true
here
in
this
land
so
new
to
her
and
so
wonderful
were
things
about
which
she
had
pondered
and
puzzled
and
asked
questions
the
tongues
for
instance
and
the
and
the
how
simply
and
naturally
each
was
now
explained
explained
as
she
herself
had
imagined
each
would
be
she
felt
a
sudden
pride
in
herself
so
far
had
anything
been
really
unexpected
as
she
went
back
to
pause
in
front
of
the
little
old
gentleman
it
was
with
a
delightful
sense
of
understanding
oh
this
was
one
of
her
gloriously
come
true
now
she
felt
a
very
flood
of
questions
surge
to
her
lips
she
pointed
to
a
deep
yellow
bowl
set
on
the
table
beside
him
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
that
is
she
asked
that
that
a
and
he
smiled
oh
what
it
full
of
please
full
of
mouths
cheerily
it
was
her
turn
to
smile
she
smiled
into
the
at
its
center
was
a
queer
object
very
like
a
short
length
of
dried
i
that
part
of
a
mouth
she
ventured
he
picked
up
the
object
and
balanced
it
across
his
thumb
guessed
it
he
declared
and
it
a
fine
thing
to
carry
around
with
one
you
see
it
a
stiff
upper
lip
he
tossed
it
back
my
she
took
a
deep
breath
once
i
asked
and
about
a
stiff
upper
lip
he
went
on
with
his
polishing
should
think
you
be
more
interested
in
these
he
observed
giving
a
nod
of
the
ragged
hat
toward
a
shallow
dish
at
his
elbow
little
girls
generally
are
she
looked
and
saw
that
the
dish
was
heaped
high
with
what
seemed
to
be
peanuts
that
tapered
to
a
point
at
one
end
she
puckered
her
brows
over
them
ca
guess
said
he
then
you
did
drink
enough
of
that
well
ever
hear
of
a
sweet
tooth
at
that
she
clapped
her
hands
and
jumped
up
and
down
why
i
one
she
cried
oh
said
the
little
old
gentleman
thought
so
i
keep
a
supply
on
hand
carve
myself
out
of
cube
sugar
oh
are
they
funny
she
leaned
above
the
shallow
dish
funny
repeated
the
not
when
they
get
into
the
wrong
mouth
a
wry
mouth
for
instance
or
an
ugly
mouth
a
sweet
tooth
should
go
you
understand
only
with
a
sweet
face
is
it
a
sweet
tooth
that
makes
a
face
sweet
she
inquired
quite
so
he
held
up
the
nose
to
examine
it
critically
she
watched
him
in
silence
for
a
while
then
you
do
mind
telling
me
who
going
to
have
that
she
ventured
pointing
a
finger
at
the
nose
this
oh
this
is
for
a
certain
little
boy
father
she
blinked
thoughtfully
is
his
name
she
began
and
stopped
his
father
the
unfortunate
man
has
been
keeping
his
own
nose
to
the
grindstone
pretty
steadily
of
late
and
so
i
ca
just
remember
the
name
i
thinking
about
said
gwendolyn
troubled
he
glanced
up
and
the
round
bright
eyes
were
grave
as
he
searched
her
face
i
wonder
he
said
in
a
low
voice
if
you
know
who
are
she
smiled
well
i
been
acquainted
with
myself
for
seven
years
she
declared
but
do
you
know
who
you
the
round
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
felt
uncertain
i
did
just
a
little
while
ago
now
though
he
reached
to
take
her
hand
shall
i
tell
you
yes
in
a
whisper
you
the
poor
little
rich
girl
he
patted
her
hand
the
poor
little
rich
girl
she
nodded
bravely
and
stood
looking
up
at
him
he
was
old
and
unkempt
out
at
elbows
too
and
the
bottoms
of
his
baggy
trousers
hung
in
dusty
shreds
but
his
lined
and
bearded
face
was
kind
i
i
have
been
so
very
happy
she
said
falteringly
he
shook
his
head
not
happy
and
no
either
well
er
she
felt
uncertain
there
are
some
just
across
the
street
not
the
same
thing
he
declared
shortly
but
hm
as
he
coughed
he
waved
an
arm
cheerily
things
will
improve
oh
yes
all
you
got
to
do
is
follow
my
advice
the
gray
eyes
were
wistful
and
questioning
you
got
a
lot
to
do
he
went
on
oh
a
deal
for
instance
here
he
paused
running
his
fingers
through
his
long
hair
there
miss
royle
and
thomas
and
jane
she
was
silent
for
a
long
moment
miss
royle
thomas
jane
in
the
joy
of
being
out
of
doors
of
having
real
dirt
to
scuff
in
and
high
grass
through
which
to
brush
of
having
a
plaid
gingham
with
a
pocket
and
all
the
fizzing
drink
she
wished
of
being
able
to
dabble
and
wade
and
of
having
good
squashy
for
pies
in
the
joy
at
all
this
she
had
utterly
forgotten
them
she
looked
up
at
the
tapered
trees
and
down
at
the
ground
then
at
the
and
the
loaded
tables
of
that
marvelous
establishment
there
was
still
so
much
to
see
and
oh
how
many
scores
of
questions
to
ask
he
bent
until
his
beard
swept
the
you
just
have
to
keep
out
of
their
he
declared
again
she
nodded
twisting
and
untwisting
her
fingers
i
thought
maybe
they
did
come
here
come
he
grunted
wo
they
be
hunting
well
keep
out
of
their
clutches
i
say
that
absolutely
necessary
you
see
why
if
you
let
get
you
for
how
you
ever
find
your
father
a
sudden
flush
swept
her
face
she
looked
at
the
ground
she
had
forgotten
miss
royle
and
thomas
and
jane
worse
until
that
moment
had
forgotten
her
father
and
mother
there
that
harness
of
his
went
on
the
he
thought
a
moment
pursing
his
lips
and
twiddling
his
thumbs
we
have
to
consider
how
we
can
get
rid
of
it
she
glanced
up
where
does
he
come
she
asked
huskily
my
um
yes
where
he
seemed
uneasy
scratched
his
jaw
and
rearranged
a
row
of
chins
well
the
fact
is
he
comes
here
to
er
buy
candles
that
burn
at
both
ends
of
course
is
it
far
out
in
a
new
fashionable
addition
yes
addition
subtraction
multiplication
wo
mind
showing
me
the
way
now
her
face
grew
pale
with
earnestness
he
smiled
sadly
i
your
father
thinks
poorly
of
me
he
driven
me
off
the
block
once
or
twice
you
know
though
he
looked
away
thoughtfully
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
such
a
lot
of
difference
between
your
father
and
me
he
makes
money
i
make
faces
it
was
one
of
those
unpleasant
moments
when
there
seemed
very
little
to
be
said
she
stood
on
the
other
foot
he
began
polishing
once
more
then
there
that
bee
he
resumed
he
went
on
as
quickly
as
possible
of
course
there
are
lots
of
things
worse
than
one
of
those
she
sees
nothing
else
she
nothing
else
um
we
help
her
get
rid
of
it
if
you
got
a
lot
to
overcome
recollect
the
policeman
she
retreated
a
step
just
suppose
we
meet
and
the
bear
that
my
yes
and
a
certain
doctor
oh
bad
pretty
bad
where
does
my
come
timidly
the
question
embarrassed
er
the
place
is
full
of
he
began
and
and
and
and
er
lanterns
she
looked
concerned
i
ca
guess
just
ordinary
lanterns
he
added
you
see
the
madam
comes
to
to
robin
hood
barn
robin
hood
barn
exactly
nice
day
it
by
the
expression
on
his
face
gwendolyn
judged
that
robin
barn
of
which
she
had
often
heard
was
a
most
undesirable
spot
is
it
far
she
asked
swallowing
no
only
we
have
to
go
around
it
somehow
all
at
once
he
seemed
the
one
friend
she
had
she
put
out
a
hand
to
him
you
go
with
me
she
begged
oh
i
want
to
find
my
and
my
you
want
to
tell
the
real
truth
about
those
three
servants
hiring
unless
i
mistaken
your
parents
have
never
taken
one
good
square
look
at
those
three
oh
let
start
now
of
a
sudden
all
the
hopes
and
plans
of
the
past
months
came
crowding
back
into
her
mind
i
want
to
sit
at
the
table
she
declared
and
i
want
to
live
in
the
country
and
go
to
he
hung
the
over
a
shoulder
you
can
do
every
one
of
them
he
said
if
we
find
your
father
and
mother
we
find
them
she
cried
determinedly
we
find
he
said
if
as
we
go
along
we
do
leave
one
single
stone
oh
she
glanced
about
her
searching
the
ground
not
he
repeated
and
now
we
start
he
picked
up
two
or
three
small
articles
an
ear
a
handful
of
hair
a
plump
cheek
but
there
a
stone
right
here
said
gwendolyn
it
was
a
small
one
and
lay
at
her
feet
close
to
the
he
peered
over
all
right
turn
it
she
stooped
turned
the
rock
straightened
the
next
moment
a
chill
swept
her
the
next
she
felt
a
heavy
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
clumsy
fingers
busy
with
the
buttons
on
the
gingham
dress
hee
hee
hee
it
was
the
voice
that
had
called
from
a
distance
hearing
it
now
she
felt
a
sudden
sickish
sinking
feeling
she
whirled
a
strange
creature
was
kneeling
behind
her
a
creature
dressed
in
black
sateen
and
like
no
human
being
that
she
had
ever
met
before
for
it
was
one
face
the
front
was
blowzy
and
freckled
with
a
small
pug
nose
and
a
quarrelsome
mouth
the
other
the
face
on
what
with
ordinary
persons
was
the
back
of
the
head
was
dark
and
forbidding
its
nose
a
large
pug
the
mouth
underneath
shaped
most
extraordinarily
not
unlike
a
for
it
was
wide
and
long
and
square
at
the
corners
and
full
of
shining
teeth
but
the
creature
had
only
one
tongue
this
was
loose
at
both
ends
so
that
there
was
one
tip
for
her
front
face
and
one
for
the
back
but
she
had
only
one
pair
of
eyes
these
were
reddish
they
watched
gwendolyn
boldly
from
the
front
then
rolled
quickly
to
the
rear
to
stare
at
the
at
sight
of
the
creature
gwendolyn
shrank
away
frightened
oh
oh
my
she
faltered
both
horrid
mouths
now
bellowed
hilariously
and
the
creature
reached
out
a
big
hand
look
here
gwendolyn
it
ordered
you
ai
goin
gwendolyn
lifted
terrified
eyes
for
a
second
look
at
the
hair
the
blowzy
countenance
no
possibility
of
doubt
remained
it
was
jane
chapter
ix
bobbing
and
swaying
foolishly
the
shuffled
to
her
feet
and
gwendolyn
though
she
wanted
to
turn
and
flee
beyond
the
reach
of
those
big
clutching
hands
found
herself
rooted
to
the
ground
and
could
only
stand
and
stare
helplessly
the
stepped
to
her
side
hastily
his
look
was
perturbed
my
my
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
she
worse
than
i
thought
worse
with
a
little
gasp
of
relief
at
having
him
so
near
gwendolyn
slipped
her
trembling
fingers
into
his
she
worse
than
thought
she
managed
to
whisper
back
neither
was
given
a
chance
to
say
more
for
seeing
them
thus
hand
in
hand
jane
suddenly
started
forward
with
a
great
boisterous
hop
and
skip
her
front
face
was
distorted
with
a
jealous
scowl
she
gave
gwendolyn
a
rough
sidewise
shove
git
away
from
that
old
beggar
she
commanded
harshly
why
kidnap
you
look
at
his
knife
nimbly
the
little
old
gentleman
thrust
himself
in
front
of
her
barring
her
way
and
shielding
gwendolyn
who
told
you
where
she
was
he
asked
angrily
who
mocked
jane
impudently
well
who
is
it
that
tells
people
things
you
mean
the
jane
front
face
broke
into
a
pleased
grin
i
mean
the
bird
she
bragged
and
balanced
from
foot
to
foot
gwendolyn
peeking
round
at
her
of
a
sudden
felt
a
fresh
concern
the
bird
the
same
bird
that
had
repeated
tales
against
her
father
and
now
he
was
tattling
on
her
she
saw
all
her
hopes
of
finding
her
parents
all
her
happy
plans
in
danger
of
being
blighted
oh
my
goodness
she
said
mournfully
she
was
holding
tight
to
the
little
old
gentleman
now
he
leaned
down
we
get
rid
of
her
he
declared
you
know
what
i
said
she
make
us
trouble
here
none
of
that
it
was
jane
once
more
the
grin
replaced
by
a
dark
look
i
have
you
know
this
child
is
in
charge
again
she
tried
to
seize
gwendolyn
the
stood
his
ground
resolutely
and
swung
the
curved
knife
up
to
check
any
advance
she
does
need
you
he
declared
she
seven
and
she
and
to
gwendolyn
her
so
do
be
afraid
tell
her
gwendolyn
promptly
opened
her
mouth
but
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
speak
her
lips
seemed
dry
her
tongue
refused
to
move
she
could
only
swallow
as
if
he
understood
her
plight
the
little
old
gentleman
suddenly
sprang
aside
to
where
was
the
snatched
something
out
of
it
ran
to
the
other
table
and
picked
up
an
oblong
leather
case
a
case
exactly
like
the
one
in
which
miss
royle
kept
her
spectacles
put
the
something
out
of
the
into
the
case
closed
the
case
with
a
snap
and
put
it
with
a
swift
motion
into
gwendolyn
hand
there
he
cried
triumphantly
there
that
stiff
upper
lip
you
can
answer
it
was
true
no
sooner
did
she
feel
the
leather
case
against
her
palm
than
her
fear
and
her
hesitation
and
lack
of
words
were
gone
she
assumed
a
determined
attitude
and
went
up
to
jane
i
do
need
you
she
said
firmly
i
seven
years
old
now
and
i
grown
up
and
what
are
you
here
for
at
the
very
boldness
of
it
jane
manner
completely
changed
that
front
countenance
took
on
a
silly
simper
and
she
put
her
head
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
ingratiatingly
what
am
i
here
for
she
repeated
in
an
injured
tone
and
you
ask
me
that
miss
why
what
i
be
doin
for
you
lovie
but
attendance
at
that
she
began
to
act
most
curiously
stepping
to
the
right
and
pointing
a
toe
stepping
to
the
left
and
pointing
a
toe
setting
down
one
heel
setting
down
the
other
then
taking
a
waltzing
turn
oh
said
gwendolyn
understanding
for
dancing
attendance
was
precisely
what
jane
was
doing
after
observing
the
other
antics
for
a
moment
she
tossed
her
head
well
if
all
you
want
to
do
she
said
unconcernedly
why
yes
dance
broke
in
the
snapping
his
fingers
frolic
and
frisk
and
flounce
jane
obeyed
and
waltzed
up
to
the
say
what
the
price
of
that
big
braid
she
called
between
her
teeth
she
had
spied
the
red
coronet
and
was
admiring
its
plaited
beauty
from
under
those
long
square
brows
the
little
old
gentleman
frowned
across
the
table
at
her
i
quote
you
no
prices
he
answered
you
have
paid
me
yet
for
your
extra
face
jane
reply
was
an
impudent
she
was
examining
the
different
things
on
the
and
hopping
sillily
from
foot
to
foot
gwendolyn
tugged
gently
at
a
ca
we
run
now
she
asked
and
hide
sh
warned
the
not
stirring
what
was
that
i
do
know
both
held
their
breath
and
gwendolyn
took
a
more
firm
hold
of
the
after
a
moment
the
little
old
gentleman
began
to
speak
very
low
we
sha
be
able
to
steal
away
she
watching
us
out
of
the
back
of
her
head
yes
i
can
see
shine
i
believe
that
when
she
rolled
her
eyes
from
one
face
to
the
other
it
made
that
scares
me
whispered
gwendolyn
ump
he
grunted
ought
to
cheer
you
up
for
it
my
opinion
that
her
eyes
rumble
her
head
if
it
was
hollow
i
think
i
know
she
answered
doubtfully
you
see
she
been
my
nurse
a
long
time
but
would
it
help
he
advised
and
if
it
a
fact
your
mother
ought
to
know
gwendolyn
watching
saw
two
shining
spots
in
jane
back
face
grow
suddenly
small
to
the
size
of
glinting
then
disappear
the
nurse
turned
and
came
dancing
back
you
better
let
me
have
that
braid
old
man
she
cried
rudely
i
smooth
down
your
saucy
tongue
he
threatened
tee
hee
hee
hee
she
tittered
ha
ha
ha
gwendolyn
had
heard
her
laugh
before
but
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
her
laugh
the
too
now
at
the
same
moment
both
witnessed
an
extraordinary
thing
as
jane
chuckled
she
lifted
one
stout
arm
so
that
a
black
sateen
cuff
was
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
front
face
and
holding
it
there
actually
in
her
sleeve
laughed
in
her
sleeve
a
great
deal
more
for
with
each
chuckle
from
the
top
of
her
red
head
to
her
very
feet
grew
a
trifle
more
plump
the
little
old
gentleman
warned
her
with
one
long
finger
you
look
out
young
lady
said
he
one
of
these
days
you
laugh
on
the
other
side
of
your
face
which
made
gwendolyn
wish
that
it
was
not
impolite
to
correct
those
older
than
herself
for
it
was
plain
that
he
meant
you
laugh
on
your
face
jane
put
out
a
at
him
insolently
then
dancing
near
come
she
bade
gwendolyn
come
away
with
nurse
the
made
no
effort
to
interpose
but
he
wagged
his
head
significantly
it
evident
miss
jane
said
he
that
forgotten
all
about
the
piper
she
came
short
and
showed
herself
upset
by
what
he
had
said
for
she
did
a
he
was
not
slow
to
take
advantage
we
sure
to
see
him
shortly
he
went
on
and
when
we
do
because
your
account
with
him
is
adding
up
you
dancing
a
good
deal
you
know
how
can
i
help
demanded
jane
ai
i
dancin
atten
gwendolyn
forgot
to
listen
to
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
all
at
once
she
was
a
little
apprehensive
on
her
own
account
remembering
how
had
danced
beside
the
not
half
an
hour
before
she
began
timidly
do
you
mean
the
piper
that
everybody
has
to
pay
exactly
replied
the
little
old
gentleman
he
out
collecting
some
pay
for
me
now
from
a
dishonest
fellow
who
did
settle
for
two
dozen
ears
that
i
boxed
and
sent
him
at
that
jane
began
tittering
harder
than
ever
hysterically
this
time
holding
up
her
arm
as
before
and
filling
out
two
or
three
wrinkles
in
the
black
sateen
and
gwendolyn
watching
closely
saw
that
while
the
front
face
of
her
nurse
was
all
the
face
on
the
back
of
her
head
wore
a
nervous
expression
evidently
that
front
face
was
not
always
to
be
depended
upon
the
little
old
gentleman
also
remarked
the
nervous
expression
and
followed
up
the
advantage
already
won
now
said
he
perhaps
be
willing
to
come
along
quietly
we
just
starting
you
understand
he
jerked
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
gwendolyn
glanced
in
the
direction
he
pointed
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
a
wide
smooth
road
led
away
from
the
a
road
as
wide
and
smooth
and
curving
as
the
drive
like
the
drive
it
was
on
either
side
but
lighted
by
a
row
of
tiny
electric
bulbs
with
frosted
shades
each
resembling
an
incandescent
toadstool
she
remembered
having
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
similar
in
a
these
tiny
lamps
were
set
close
together
on
short
stems
precisely
as
white
stones
of
a
selected
size
edged
all
the
paths
at
johnnie
blake
and
each
gave
out
a
soft
light
she
did
not
have
to
ask
about
them
she
guessed
promptly
what
they
were
lights
to
make
plain
the
way
for
people
feet
in
short
nothing
more
nor
less
than
footlights
a
few
times
in
her
life
so
few
that
she
could
tell
them
off
on
her
pink
fingers
she
had
been
taken
to
the
theater
jane
accompanying
her
by
right
of
miss
royle
by
her
superior
right
as
judge
of
all
matters
that
partook
of
entertainment
thomas
coming
also
though
apparently
for
no
reason
whatever
to
grace
a
rear
seat
along
with
the
chauffeur
seated
in
a
box
close
to
the
curved
edge
of
the
stage
she
had
seen
the
soft
glow
of
the
footlights
but
for
some
reason
which
she
could
not
fathom
the
footlights
had
always
been
carefully
concealed
from
everyone
but
the
people
on
the
stage
trying
to
imagine
them
without
any
suggestions
from
miss
royle
or
jane
she
had
patterned
them
after
a
certain
stuffed
that
stood
on
how
different
was
the
reality
and
how
much
more
satisfactory
jane
looked
up
the
road
between
the
lines
of
footlights
you
just
startin
she
repeated
where
to
find
her
father
and
mother
answered
the
stoutly
at
that
jane
shook
her
huge
pompadour
father
and
mother
she
cried
indeed
you
wo
not
while
care
of
her
and
reaching
out
caught
gwendolyn
by
a
slender
wrist
the
seized
the
other
and
the
next
moment
gwendolyn
was
unpleasantly
reminded
of
times
in
the
nursery
times
when
miss
royle
and
jane
disagreeing
about
her
each
pulled
at
an
arm
and
quarreled
for
here
was
the
nurse
tugging
one
direction
to
drag
her
away
and
the
little
old
gentleman
tugging
the
other
with
all
his
might
slap
her
hands
slap
her
hands
he
shouted
excitedly
it
start
circulation
both
slapped
so
hard
that
her
hands
stung
and
with
the
result
he
sought
for
instantly
all
three
began
going
in
circles
around
and
around
faster
and
faster
and
faster
it
was
jane
who
first
let
go
she
was
puffing
hard
and
the
perspiration
was
standing
out
upon
her
forehead
i
going
to
call
the
policeman
she
threatened
shrilly
oh
oh
please
do
gwendolyn
cry
was
as
shrill
i
do
want
him
to
get
me
the
policeman
then
retorted
the
and
to
gwendolyn
soothingly
hush
hush
child
jane
danced
away
sidewise
as
if
to
keep
watch
as
she
went
help
help
she
shouted
police
police
gwendolyn
was
terribly
frightened
but
she
could
not
run
one
wrist
was
still
in
the
grasp
of
the
little
old
gentleman
with
wildly
throbbing
heart
she
watched
the
road
is
he
coming
called
the
little
old
gentleman
he
too
was
looking
up
the
curving
road
a
whistle
sounded
it
was
piercing
and
now
gwendolyn
heard
movements
all
about
her
in
the
forest
the
soft
of
running
paws
the
sound
of
wings
as
if
small
live
things
were
fleeing
before
the
sharp
call
jane
hastened
back
galloping
a
polka
turn
a
stone
turn
a
stone
she
cried
rumbling
her
eyes
gwendolyn
clung
to
the
little
old
gentleman
oh
do
let
her
she
plead
what
if
we
will
a
do
yelled
jane
excitedly
yes
yes
answered
the
you
seen
stones
in
rings
have
you
are
the
nurse
stooped
picked
up
a
small
stone
and
sent
it
spinning
from
the
end
of
a
thumb
faint
with
fear
gwendolyn
thrust
a
trembling
hand
into
the
and
took
hold
of
the
then
leaning
against
the
little
old
gentleman
her
yellow
head
by
the
dusty
flap
of
his
torn
coat
she
waited
chapter
x
what
she
first
saw
was
a
face
straight
ahead
at
the
top
of
a
steep
rise
where
the
wide
road
narrowed
to
a
point
the
face
was
a
man
and
upon
it
the
footlights
beat
so
strongly
that
each
feature
was
startlingly
vivid
but
it
was
not
the
fact
that
she
saw
a
face
that
set
her
knees
to
trembling
weakly
nor
the
fact
that
the
face
was
fearfully
distorted
but
because
it
was
down
she
stared
feeling
herself
grow
cold
her
flesh
creep
oh
i
want
to
go
home
she
gasped
the
face
began
to
move
nearer
slowly
inch
by
inch
and
there
sounded
a
hoarse
outcry
hoo
hoo
hoo
it
was
the
little
old
gentleman
who
reassured
her
somewhat
by
his
even
voice
ah
said
he
with
something
of
pride
yet
as
if
to
himself
he
realizes
that
the
black
eye
is
a
beauty
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
is
coming
to
match
it
but
what
temporary
confidence
she
gained
fled
when
jane
tettering
from
side
to
side
began
to
threaten
in
a
most
terrifying
way
young
miss
she
cried
you
goin
to
be
sorry
you
did
mind
jane
oh
told
you
he
git
you
some
fine
day
the
retorted
what
gwendolyn
did
not
hear
she
was
sick
with
apprehension
i
guess
i
wo
find
my
father
and
now
she
whispered
miserably
then
all
at
once
she
could
see
than
a
face
silhouetted
against
the
lighted
sky
was
a
figure
broad
shouldered
and
belted
with
swinging
cudgel
and
visored
cap
it
was
like
those
dreaded
figures
that
patroled
the
drive
yet
how
different
for
as
the
policeman
came
on
his
wild
face
peered
between
his
peered
between
his
for
the
reason
that
he
was
and
walking
his
hands
hoo
hoo
hoo
he
clamored
again
his
coat
flopped
about
his
ears
his
natural
merino
socks
showed
where
his
trousers
fell
away
from
his
shoes
his
club
bumped
the
side
of
his
head
at
every
stride
of
his
long
arms
his
identification
was
complete
for
precisely
as
thomas
had
declared
he
was
over
my
breathed
gwendolyn
so
astonished
that
she
almost
forgot
to
be
anxious
for
her
own
safety
what
a
marvelous
land
was
this
where
everything
was
really
as
it
ought
to
be
the
addressed
her
smiling
down
you
wo
mind
if
we
do
start
for
a
minute
or
two
will
you
he
inquired
this
officer
will
probably
want
to
discuss
the
prices
of
eyes
you
see
i
gave
him
his
black
one
if
he
wants
another
though
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
the
piper
to
collect
are
are
you
afraid
of
him
stammered
gwendolyn
in
a
whisper
he
echoed
surprised
why
no
are
somehow
she
felt
ashamed
very
she
faltered
no
sooner
did
she
partly
deny
her
fear
than
she
experienced
a
most
delicious
feeling
of
security
and
this
feeling
grew
as
she
watched
the
nearing
policeman
for
she
saw
that
he
was
in
a
mournful
state
it
was
worry
and
grief
that
distorted
his
face
the
dark
eyes
above
the
visor
both
the
black
eye
and
the
other
one
were
streaming
with
tears
tears
which
naturally
enough
ran
from
the
four
corners
of
his
eyes
down
across
his
forehead
and
on
into
his
hair
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
weeping
for
a
long
time
for
his
cap
was
full
and
now
she
realized
that
the
hoarse
cries
which
had
filled
her
with
terror
were
the
saddest
of
complaints
were
not
hoo
hoo
but
hoo
poor
man
sympathized
the
little
old
gentleman
wagging
his
beard
jane
however
with
characteristic
lack
of
compassion
hopped
about
loudly
and
straightening
out
any
number
of
wrinkles
oh
ai
he
a
sight
she
chortled
she
had
entirely
given
over
her
threatening
gwendolyn
now
felt
secure
enough
but
she
did
not
feel
like
laughing
she
was
sober
to
the
point
of
pitying
for
though
he
looked
ridiculous
he
was
so
absolutely
helpless
so
utterly
unhappy
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
exclaimed
as
he
came
on
hand
over
hand
legs
held
together
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
rhythmically
like
the
pendulum
of
the
metronome
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
need
any
sharpening
called
out
the
brandishing
the
curved
knife
is
there
something
wrong
wrong
echoed
the
policeman
dolefully
i
should
say
so
oh
oh
dear
and
still
weeping
copiously
so
that
his
forehead
glistened
with
his
tears
he
plodded
across
the
border
of
the
it
was
then
that
gwendolyn
recalled
under
what
circumstances
she
had
seen
him
last
only
two
or
three
days
before
when
bound
homeward
in
the
limousine
she
had
spied
him
loitering
beside
the
walled
walk
what
makes
his
club
shine
so
she
had
asked
jane
whispering
eh
whispered
jane
in
return
what
else
than
the
wind
was
blowing
as
the
automobile
swept
past
him
the
breeze
lifted
the
tail
of
his
belted
coat
and
for
one
terrifying
instant
gwendolyn
caught
a
glimpse
of
steel
and
if
he
do
mean
harm
to
anybody
jane
had
added
when
gwendolyn
turned
scared
eyes
to
her
why
does
he
carry
a
but
there
was
no
need
to
fear
a
weapon
now
the
falling
away
of
his
had
uncovered
his
and
as
he
halted
gwendolyn
saw
that
his
revolver
was
gone
his
empty
she
took
a
timid
step
toward
him
how
do
you
do
mr
officer
she
said
ca
you
let
your
feet
come
down
then
you
be
on
your
back
and
you
could
get
up
the
right
way
up
came
his
face
between
his
he
stared
at
her
with
his
new
black
eye
with
the
other
one
too
she
noted
that
it
was
blue
but
i
up
the
right
way
he
answered
oh
no
it
is
that
it
that
his
hands
were
encased
in
white
cotton
gloves
he
rocked
himself
from
one
to
the
other
no
it
that
agreed
the
little
old
gentleman
but
i
firmly
believe
that
you
feel
better
if
you
order
another
eye
another
eye
said
the
policeman
bitterly
would
another
eye
help
me
to
find
him
oh
i
see
the
spoke
with
some
concern
then
flown
gwendolyn
puzzled
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
who
is
she
asked
the
policeman
bumped
his
head
against
his
the
bird
he
mourned
at
that
jane
hopped
up
and
down
in
evident
delight
but
gwendolyn
fell
back
taking
up
a
position
beside
the
little
old
gentleman
that
bird
again
and
it
was
evident
that
the
policeman
thought
well
of
him
pity
swiftly
merged
into
suspicion
i
you
mean
the
bird
that
tells
people
things
she
ventured
to
be
sure
that
she
was
not
misjudging
him
he
wiped
his
black
eye
on
a
aye
he
answered
that
the
one
and
oh
but
he
could
tell
things
gwendolyn
considered
the
statement
at
last
he
a
tattletale
she
charged
and
felt
her
cheeks
crimson
with
sudden
anger
he
nodded
so
vigorously
that
some
of
his
tears
splashed
over
the
rim
of
his
cap
that
why
the
police
ca
get
along
without
him
he
declared
and
oh
here
i
gone
and
lost
him
and
they
put
me
off
the
force
bump
bump
bump
they
she
questioned
do
you
mean
the
they
and
they
know
so
much
explained
the
little
old
gentleman
because
the
bird
tells
he
tells
everything
grumbled
the
officer
they
send
him
around
the
whole
country
hunting
gossip
when
he
ought
to
be
working
exclusively
in
the
interest
of
law
and
order
law
and
order
gwendolyn
wondered
who
these
two
were
he
knows
everything
do
asserted
the
policeman
and
everything
does
here
he
jerked
his
head
sidewise
at
jane
she
retreated
an
expression
of
guilt
on
that
front
face
and
everything
do
he
went
on
indicating
gwendolyn
i
know
that
she
said
in
an
injured
tone
he
told
jane
i
was
here
at
that
the
policeman
gave
himself
a
quick
you
him
he
demanded
of
the
nurse
she
shifted
from
side
to
side
nervously
it
ai
the
same
one
she
protested
it
he
interrupted
you
could
be
mistaken
he
declared
did
he
have
a
bumpy
forehead
and
a
lumpy
tail
you
do
mean
lump
of
said
gwendolyn
astonished
he
does
said
the
little
old
gentleman
and
the
bumpy
forehead
is
from
having
to
remember
so
many
things
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
well
i
think
i
like
bird
she
said
and
i
do
believe
he
far
when
you
whistled
i
heard
flying
and
flying
corrected
the
policeman
running
and
flying
to
he
said
it
proudly
the
squirrels
and
the
and
the
sparrows
all
follow
me
here
from
the
park
of
a
night
knowing
i
protect
oh
murmured
gwendolyn
you
protect
she
looked
sidewise
at
jane
reflecting
that
the
nurse
had
given
him
quite
another
character
yes
and
i
protect
old
old
people
huh
snorted
the
you
protect
old
people
eh
well
how
about
old
you
ought
to
know
answered
the
officer
promptly
i
guess
you
give
me
that
black
eye
for
nothing
whereat
the
little
old
gentleman
suddenly
subsided
into
silence
yes
i
protect
old
people
reiterated
the
other
and
the
blind
of
course
and
the
trees
and
the
flowers
and
the
fountains
also
the
statues
there
the
general
for
instance
if
i
did
watch
out
folks
would
scribble
on
him
with
chalk
gwendolyn
assented
once
more
she
was
beginning
to
have
belief
in
him
then
he
resumed
i
look
after
the
children
so
that
she
started
the
children
but
she
interrupted
always
told
me
that
you
grab
little
boys
and
girls
carry
then
fairly
shook
at
her
own

urged
the
little
old
gentleman
the
policeman
leaned
his
feet
against
the

the
man
said
he
that

little
kids
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
to
their
fathers
and

gwendolyn
came
round
upon
jane
lifting
accusing
eyes
pointing
an
accusing
finger
so
she
breathed
you
told
me
he
stole

is
and
she
wiggled
the
finger
jane
edged
away
head
on
one
side
oh
i
was
jokin

she
declared
lightly
but
accidentally
she
turned
aside
her
grinning
front
face
and
gave
the
others
a
glimpse
of
the
back
one
and
each
noted
how
the
square
mouth
was
trembling
with
anxiety
exclaimed
gwendolyn
triumphantly
i
finding
you
out
the
policeman
crossed
his
feet
against
the
taking
care
not
to
injure
any
of
the
articles
there
displayed
yes
i
taken
a
lot
of
lost
little
kids
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
he
repeated
and
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
she
gave
him
no
chance
to
finish
his
sentence
in
her
joy
at
finding
that
here
was
another
friend
she
ran
to
him
and
leaned
to
smile
into
his
face
you
help
to
find
my
and
wo
you
she
cried
we
were
starting
just
as
you
came
said
the
well
let
be
off
his
whistle
hung
by
a
thin
chain
from
a
of
his
coat
he
swung
it
to
his
lips
toot
it
was
a
cheery
blast
the
next
moment
coming
as
it
were
on
the
heels
of
her
sudden
good
fortune
gwendolyn
closed
her
right
hand
and
found
herself
possessed
of
a
bag
of
candy
of
the
variety
that
she
had
often
seen
selling
at
street
corners
out
of
that
went
on
wheels
more
than
once
she
had
longed
and
in
vain
to
stop
at
one
of
these
and
purchase
now
she
suddenly
remembered
having
done
so
with
a
high
hand
the
sticks
were
striped
spirally
boldly
she
produced
one
and
fell
to
sucking
it
making
more
noise
with
her
sucking
than
ever
the
strict
proprieties
of
the
nursery
permitted
then
candy
in
hand
and
with
the
little
old
gentleman
on
her
right
the
policeman
on
her
left
and
jane
trailing
behind
doing
a
she
set
forward
gayly
along
the
wide
curving
road
chapter
xi
as
she
trotted
along
pulling
with
great
relish
at
a
she
glanced
down
at
the
policeman
every
now
and
then
and
glowed
with
pride
on
some
few
occasions
her
chauffeur
had
condescended
to
hold
a
short
conversation
with
her
had
even
permitted
her
to
sound
the
clarion
of
the
limousine
with
its
bright
piercing
tones
all
of
which
had
been
keenly
gratifying
but
here
she
was
actually
conversing
with
an
officer
in
full
uniform
and
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
she
proffered
him
the
bag
of
spiral
sweets
he
cocked
his
head
side
wise
at
it
is
that
the
chewing
kind
he
inquired
oh
i
sorry
however
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
disappointed
for
he
had
a
mouthful
of
gum
and
this
he
cracked
loudly
from
time
to
time
in
a
way
that
excited
her
admiration
and
envy
i
watched
you
go
by
our
house
lots
of
times
she
confided
presently
eager
to
say
something
cordial
oh
said
he
it
a
beat
that
does
well
enough
in
summer
but
in
the
wintertime
i
rather
be
puffing
a
little
for
though
he
was
upside
down
and
walking
on
his
hands
he
had
so
far
made
good
progress
he
halted
and
rested
his
feet
against
the
lowest
limb
of
a
tree
that
stood
close
to
the
road
now
his
cap
touched
the
ground
and
his
hands
were
free
with
one
finger
he
drew
three
short
lines
in
the
packed
dirt
and
you
to
be
declared
the
little
old
gentleman
halting
too
because
you
a
policeman
with
a
level
head
a
level
head
gwendolyn
stooped
to
look
and
saw
that
it
was
indeed
a
fact
if
i
had
one
answered
the
policeman
with
dignity
would
i
be
able
to
stand
up
comfortably
in
this
remarkable
manner
oh
tee
hee
hee
hee
it
was
the
nurse
her
sleeve
lifted
her
blowzy
face
convulsed
as
she
laughed
gwendolyn
saw
wrinkle
after
wrinkle
in
the
black
sateen
taken
up
with
truly
alarming
rapidity
my
she
exclaimed
jane
always
been
stout
but
now
the
policeman
was
deepening
the
three
short
lines
in
the
dirt
making
a
capital
a
two
streets
come
together
he
said
placing
his
finger
on
the
point
of
the
letter
and
the
block
that
connects
just
before
they
meet
that
the
beat
for
i
hope
you
get
it
she
said
heartily
get
it
he
repeated
bitterly
well
i
certainly
wo
if
i
do
find
that
bird
and
he
started
forward
once
more
the
trudging
alongside
craned
to
peer
ahead
his
grizzled
beard
sticking
straight
out
in
front
of
him
now
let
me
see
he
mused
in
a
puzzled
way
which
route
i
wonder
had
we
better
take
that
depends
on
where
we
going
replied
the
policeman
helplessly
and
with
the
bird
gone
of
course
i
do
know
i
tell
you
said
the
little
old
gentleman
promptly
first
we
must
cross
the
glass
gwendolyn
gave
him
a
quick
glance
surely
he
meant
cross
the
yes
the
glass
go
on
encouraged
the
and
find
those
round
dark
eyes
darted
a
quick
glance
at
gwendolyn
jane
capering
at
his
heels
now
interrupted
find
him
she
taunted
gwendolyn
never
find
her
father
if
she
do
listen
to
me
he
ignored
her
next
he
went
on
we
steer
straight
for
robin
hood
barn
oh
exclaimed
the
policeman
then
we
have
to
go
around
has
to
go
around
once
more
jane
broke
in
gwendolyn
she
called
you
never
find
your
mother
this
precious
pair
is
takin
you
the
wrong
way
gwendolyn
paid
no
heed
ahead
the
road
divided
to
the
left
in
a
narrow
all
loose
soil
and
and
sharp
turns
to
the
right
in
a
level
thoroughfare
that
held
a
straight
course
she
touched
the
little
old
gentleman
elbow
which
she
whispered
as
the
parting
of
the
ways
was
reached
he
pointed
and
she
saw
a
sign
a
sign
with
an
arrow
directing
travelers
to
the
right
under
the
arrow
plainly
lettered
were
the
words
the
bear
gwendolyn
looked
her
concern
do
we
to
go
that
road
she
asked
him
he
nodded
the
next
moment
with
a
loud
rumbling
of
the
eyes
jane
came
alongside
oh
dearie
she
cried
you
could
hire
to
go
and
i
like
to
see
go
i
think
too
much
of
you
i
do
hold
your
tongue
ordered
the
little
old
gentleman
crossly
jane
obeyed
up
came
a
hand
and
she
seized
the
in
her
front
mouth
but
since
there
was
a
second
in
that
back
face
she
still
continued
her
babbling
do
ask
me
to
trapse
over
the
hard
pavements
on
my
poor
tired
feet
dearie
just
because
you
take
your
notions
come
i
say
your
mother
nobody
anyhow
you
do
know
what
you
sayin
or
doin
poor
thing
you
just
wanderin
all
just
wanderin
i
wandering
in
the
right
direction
anyhow
retorted
gwendolyn
stoutly
and
to
the
little
old
gentleman
i
sorry
we
going
this
way
though
i
of
bears
for
the
sign
was
past
now
the
four
were
on
the
level
thoroughfare
the
policeman
seemed
not
to
have
remarked
her
anxiety
and
after
the
den
what
do
we
pass
he
questioned
the
big
rock
answered
the
do
we
have
to
turn
it
the
other
spoke
with
some
annoyance
likely
to
come
out
i
suppose
it
wo
be
hiding
that
bird
there
a
hollow
under
the
rock
said
the
little
old
gentleman
find
his
face
grew
grave
and
and
after
we
go
by
the
big
rock
ventured
gwendolyn
the
little
old
gentleman
smiled
ah
then
he
said
then
we
come
to
the
pillery
oh
she
considered
the
reply
pillery
it
was
a
word
she
had
never
chanced
upon
in
the
large
dictionary
yet
she
felt
she
could
hardly
ask
any
questions
about
it
she
had
asked
so
many
already
it
kind
of
you
to
answer
and
answer
and
answer
she
said
aloud
nobody
else
ever
did
that
ask
anything
you
want
to
know
he
returned
cordially
i
always
give
you
prompt
attention
though
of
course
there
are
things
he
hesitated
yes
eagerly
that
only
fathers
and
mothers
can
answer
oh
did
you
know
that
demanded
the
policeman
surprised
tee
hee
hee
hee
snickered
jane
though
she
was
some
few
steps
in
the
rear
her
difficult
breathing
could
be
plainly
heard
she
had
laughed
so
much
into
her
sleeve
and
had
grown
so
stout
that
by
now
not
a
single
wrinkle
remained
in
the
black
sateen
she
was
beginning
to
try
every
square
inch
of
the
cloth
sorely
and
having
danced
every
foot
of
the
way
she
was
tiring
oh
questions
said
gwendolyn
precisely
answered
the
little
old
gentleman
about
my
friends
santa
claus
and
the
for
instance
they
not
friends
of
potter
i
guess
he
and
the
fairies
and
the
gnomes
and
the
giants
and
mother
goose
and
crowd
of
course
a
nurse
or
a
governess
or
a
teacher
of
some
sort
might
to
explain
would
do
any
good
though
you
understand
the
policeman
swung
his
head
back
and
forth
nodding
that
the
worst
said
he
of
being
a
poor
here
he
fell
suddenly
silent
and
spatted
the
dust
with
his
palms
in
an
embarrassed
way
she
understood
a
poor
little
rich
girl
she
said
who
does
see
her
and
but
you
will
he
declared
determinedly
and
forged
ahead
faster
than
ever
white
hand
following
white
hand
it
was
then
that
gwendolyn
heard
the
nurse
muttering
and
chortling
to
herself
well
i
never
exclaimed
the
that
was
not
being
held
if
this
ai
a
road
why
it
a
road
ha
ha
ha
makes
a
difference
gwendolyn
was
startled
what
did
jane
mean
difference
why
so
much
satisfaction
all
at
once
she
wished
the
others
would
listen
would
take
note
of
the
triumphant
air
but
both
were
busy
the
little
old
gentleman
chattering
and
pointing
ahead
the
policeman
straining
to
keep
pace
and
look
where
his
companion
directed
to
lessen
her
uneasiness
gwendolyn
hunted
a
second
stick
of
candy
then
sidled
in
between
her
two
friends
oh
please
she
began
appealingly
with
a
glance
up
and
a
glance
down
i
jane
going
to
make
us
trouble
ca
we
think
of
some
way
to
get
rid
of
her
the
policeman
twisted
his
neck
around
until
he
could
wink
at
her
with
his
black
eye
in
town
said
he
meaningly
we
policemen
have
a
way
oh
tell
us
she
begged
for
the
looked
keenly
interested
well
resumed
the
officer
and
now
he
halted
just
long
enough
to
raise
a
gloved
finger
to
one
side
of
his
head
with
a
significant
gesture
when
we
want
to
get
rid
of
a
person
we
put
a
flea
in
his
ear
gwendolyn
blushed
rosy
a
flea
it
was
an
insect
that
miss
royle
had
never
permitted
her
to
mention
still
but
but
where
could
we
er
find
a
a
she
had
stammered
that
far
when
she
saw
the
little
old
gentleman
turn
his
wrinkled
face
over
a
shoulder
next
he
jerked
an
excited
thumb
and
looking
she
saw
that
jane
was
to
keep
by
now
the
nurse
had
swelled
to
astonishing
proportions
her
body
was
as
round
as
a
barrel
her
face
was
round
too
and
more
red
than
ever
her
cheeks
were
so
puffed
the
skin
of
her
forehead
was
so
tight
and
shiny
that
she
looked
precisely
like
a
monster
copy
of
a
sanitary
rubber
doll
she
ca
last
much
longer
her
strength
giving
out
it
was
the
policeman
and
his
voice
ended
in
a
sob
yet
the
sob
meant
nothing
for
he
was
showing
all
his
white
teeth
in
a
delighted
smile
she
must
have
help
this
the
his
voice
broke
too
but
his
round
dark
eyes
were
brimming
with
laughter
who
help
her
demanded
gwendolyn
so
of
that
three
is
gone
for
good
she
halted
now
on
the
summit
of
a
rise
up
this
but
at
a
considerable
distance
jane
was
toiling
with
feeble
hops
to
the
right
and
staggering
steps
to
the
left
and
faint
fat
gasps
oh
gwendolyn
darlin
she
called
weepingly
oh
do
leave
your
jane
oh
oh
i
made
up
my
mind
announced
gwendolyn
to
have
the
in
the
brick
house
so
she
began
to
descend
rapidly
with
the
little
old
gentleman
in
a
shuffling
run
and
the
policeman
springing
from
hand
to
hand
as
if
he
feared
pursuit
and
swaying
his
legs
from
side
to
side
with
a
the
going
was
easy
soon
the
bottom
of
the
slope
was
reached
then
all
stopped
to
look
back
jane
had
just
gained
the
top
but
was
come
to
a
standstill
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
could
be
seen
only
her
full
face
like
a
big
red
moon
at
the
sight
gwendolyn
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
the
joy
of
freedom
found
again
why
she
not
coming
up
she
called
out
delightedly
going
down
and
she
punctuated
her
words
with
a
gay
skip
that
skip
proved
unfortunate
for
as
would
have
it
she
stumbled
and
stumbling
stubbed
her
toe
the
toe
struck
two
small
stones
that
lay
partly
embedded
in
the
road
dislodged
them
turned
them
end
for
end
and
sent
them
skimming
along
the
ground
cried
the
policeman
who
if
only
the
right
kind
come
added
the
little
old
gentleman
each
of
his
round
eyes
rimmed
with
sudden
white
i
blow
my
whistle
up
swung
the
shining
bit
of
metal
on
the
end
of
its
chain
blow
it
at
the
top
of
your
lungs
the
policeman
had
balanced
himself
on
his
head
thrown
away
his
gum
and
put
the
whistle
against
his
lips
now
he
raised
it
and
placed
it
against
his
chest
just
above
his
then
he
blew
and
through
the
forest
the
blast
rang
and
echoed
and
boomed
until
all
the
tapers
rose
and
fell
and
all
the
footlights
flickered
instantly
that
red
moon
sank
below
the
crest
of
the
hill
puffs
of
smoke
rose
in
its
place
then
there
was
borne
to
the
waiting
trio
a
sound
of
and
the
next
instant
with
a
purr
of
its
engine
and
a
whirr
of
its
wheels
here
into
full
sight
shot
forward
the
limousine
gwendolyn
paled
the
stick
of
candy
slipped
from
her
fingers
oh
i
do
want
to
be
shut
up
in
the
car
she
cried
out
and
i
wo
i
i
wo
she
scurried
behind
the
the
automobile
came
on
its
polished
sides
reflected
the
varied
lights
of
the
forest
its
hated
windows
glistened
one
door
swung
wide
as
if
yawning
for
a
victim
the
little
old
gentleman
as
he
watched
it
seemed
interested
rather
than
apprehensive
after
a
moment
recollect
my
speaking
of
the
piper
he
asked
at
the
mention
of
the
piper
the
policeman
stared
up
the
he
protested
stammering
and
beginning
to
back
away
at
that
gwendolyn
felt
renewed
anxiety
the
piper
she
faltered
oh
i
have
to
settle
with
him
and
thrust
a
searching
hand
into
the
the
policeman
kept
on
retreating
i
do
want
to
see
him
he
declared
he
made
me
pay
too
dear
for
my
whistle
and
he
bumped
his
head
against
his
the
hastened
to
him
and
halted
him
by
grasping
him
about
his
legs
you
ca
run
away
from
the
piper
he
reminded
so
gwendolyn
was
no
longer
frightened
in
her
search
for
money
she
had
found
the
leather
case
this
she
now
clutched
receiving
courage
from
the
stiff
but
the
policeman
was
far
from
sanguine
now
perspiration
and
not
tears
glistened
on
his
forehead
he
grasped
his
club
with
one
shaking
hand
as
for
the
little
old
gentleman
he
held
the
curved
knife
out
in
front
of
him
all
his
thin
fingers
wound
tightly
around
its
hilt
what
the
piper
got
beside
him
he
asked
in
a
tone
full
of
wonder
is
it
a
gwendolyn
looked
the
piper
was
leaning
over
the
of
the
car
he
was
so
near
by
now
that
she
could
make
him
out
clearly
a
lanky
young
man
in
a
greasy
cap
and
johnnie
blake
overalls
over
his
right
shoulder
on
a
strap
was
suspended
a
bundle
a
hung
from
a
corner
of
his
mouth
but
it
was
evidently
not
this
pipe
that
had
given
him
his
title
but
pipes
of
a
different
kind
all
of
lead
in
varying
lengths
these
were
arranged
about
his
waist
somewhat
like
a
long
uneven
fringe
and
among
them
was
a
a
coupling
or
two
and
a
cutter
beside
him
on
the
seat
in
the
foot
man
place
was
a
queer
object
it
was
tall
and
in
color
or
was
it
green
on
one
side
of
it
were
what
seemed
to
be
seven
long
leaves
on
the
other
side
were
seven
similar
leaves
and
as
the
car
rolled
swiftly
up
these
fourteen
long
projections
waved
gently
she
had
no
chance
to
examine
the
object
further
something
else
claimed
her
attention
the
windowed
door
of
the
limousine
suddenly
swung
wide
and
through
it
toward
her
was
extended
a
long
black
beckoning
arm
next
a
freckled
face
filled
the
whole
of
the
opening
spying
this
way
and
that
it
was
jane
come
dearie
she
cooed
she
had
let
go
the
front
i
would
stay
with
them
two
any
more
here
your
beautiful
car
love
is
what
take
you
fast
to
your
papa
and
mamma
cried
gwendolyn
and
to
the
she
was
of
the
piper
just
a
little
while
ago
now
she
riding
around
with
him
think
he
ssh
warned
the
little
old
gentleman
speaking
low
we
have
to
have
him
and
he
has
his
good
points
the
piper
was
staring
at
gwendolyn
impertinently
now
he
climbed
down
from
his
seat
all
his
pipes
and
as
he
moved
and
gave
her
a
mocking
salute
quite
as
if
he
knew
her
yet
without
removing
the
from
between
his
lips
or
the
greasy
cap
from
his
hair
well
if
here
ai
the
he
exclaimed
rudely
as
she
got
a
better
view
of
him
she
remembered
that
she
met
him
before
in
her
nursery
that
fortunate
morning
the
pipe
burst
he
was
the
very
piper
that
had
been
called
in
to
make
plumbing
repairs
said
gwendolyn
nodding
courteously
but
staying
close
to
the
little
old
gentleman
for
jane
had
summoned
strength
enough
to
topple
out
of
the
limousine
and
teeter
forward
now
she
was
kneeling
in
the
road
crooking
a
coaxing
finger
and
gurgling
invitingly
the
piper
scowled
at
the
nurse
say
what
do
you
think
you
doin
he
demanded
singin
a
duet
with
yourself
then
turning
upon
the
policeman
off
your
beat
ai
you
he
inquired
impudently
when
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
swung
round
upon
the
old
gent
he
began
tauntingly
i
ca
collect
real
money
for
that
dozen
ears
and
threw
out
an
arm
toward
the
object
on
the
driver
seat
gwendolyn
looked
a
second
time
and
saw
a
horrid
and
unnatural
sight
for
the
object
was
a
man
straight
enough
enough
with
arms
and
legs
feet
and
hands
and
a
small
head
but
a
man
shockingly
disfigured
for
down
either
side
of
him
projecting
from
head
and
shoulders
and
arms
were
ears
long
hairy
mulish
ears
that
wriggled
horribly
one
moment
unfolding
themselves
to
catch
every
sound
the
next
flopping
about
ridiculously
why
he
all
ears
she
gasped
the
little
old
gentleman
started
forward
it
that
dozen
i
boxed
he
announced
hey
come
out
of
there
gwendolyn
heart
sank
now
she
knew
from
the
first
her
fear
had
been
that
one
of
the
dreaded
three
would
come
and
fetch
her
out
of
the
land
before
she
could
find
her
parents
and
here
at
the
very
moment
when
she
hoped
to
leave
the
worst
of
the
trio
behind
here
was
another
to
hamper
and
tattle
and
thwart
for
the
rubber
plant
was
thomas
and
now
all
at
once
there
was
the
greatest
excitement
the
seized
thomas
by
an
ear
and
dragged
him
to
the
ground
all
the
while
upbraiding
him
loudly
and
while
these
two
were
occupied
the
piper
swaggered
toward
the
policeman
his
pipes
and
implements
striking
and
jangling
together
i
want
my
money
he
bellowed
i
do
owe
you
anything
retorted
the
policeman
all
this
gave
jane
the
opportunity
she
wished
she
advanced
upon
gwendolyn
come
sweetie
she
wheedled
rich
little
girls
do
hike
along
the
streets
like
common
poor
little
girls
so
jump
in
and
pretend
you
a
queen
and
have
a
grand
ride
now
all
of
a
sudden
a
terrible
inclination
to
obey
seized
gwendolyn
there
yawned
that
door
here
burned
those
reddish
eyes
compelling
her
forward
into
a
dreaded
grasp
she
screamed
covering
her
face
in
that
moment
of
danger
it
was
the
policeman
who
came
to
her
rescue
eluding
the
piper
he
ran
hand
over
hand
to
the
side
of
the
car
balanced
himself
on
his
level
head
and
waved
his
club
move
on
he
ordered
in
a
deep
voice
precisely
as
gwendolyn
had
heard
officers
order
at
crowded
crossings
move
on
there
the
limousine
obeyed
with
no
one
touching
the
the
engine
began
to
the
wheels
to
whirr
and
purring
again
like
some
great
live
thing
it
gained
momentum
took
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
pink
dust
and
rounding
a
distant
turn
disappeared
from
sight
chapter
xii
it
occurred
to
gwendolyn
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
idea
to
stop
turning
stones
the
first
one
set
up
had
resulted
in
the
arrival
of
jane
and
whereas
the
policeman
had
appeared
when
the
second
was
dislodged
here
following
the
accidental
stub
of
a
toe
were
these
two
the
piper
and
thomas
the
hurried
across
to
her
his
expression
dubious
bitter
pill
he
exclaimed
with
a
sidewise
jerk
of
the
ragged
hat
gall
and
wormwood
oh
yes
for
sure
enough
there
an
taste
on
her
lips
a
taste
that
made
her
regret
having
lost
the
candy
next
the
policeman
came
up
the
scheme
was
to
kidnap
you
he
declared
wrathfully
and
keep
me
from
finding
my
and
added
gwendolyn
now
she
understood
why
jane
was
so
pleased
with
the
choice
of
the
automobile
road
and
she
realized
that
all
along
there
was
never
any
danger
of
her
being
kidnaped
by
but
by
the
two
who
their
past
evidently
forgotten
were
at
this
very
moment
chuckling
and
chattering
together
ugly
heads
touching
the
eary
head
and
the
head
with
the
double
face
seeing
the
policeman
and
the
little
old
gentleman
in
conversation
with
gwendolyn
the
piper
slouched
over
look
he
began
roughly
addressing
all
three
you
goin
to
make
a
great
big
mistake
if
you
antagonize
a
man
that
belongs
to
a
labor
union
just
so
had
he
spoken
the
day
he
fixed
the
broken
pipe
bosh
cried
the
policeman
what
do
we
care
about
why
never
even
get
through
the
gate
gwendolyn
was
puzzled
gate
and
would
thomas
not
get
through
it
then
looking
round
to
where
he
was
conspiring
with
jane
she
saw
what
she
believed
was
a
very
good
explanation
he
would
never
even
get
through
the
gate
because
a
simple
reason
the
would
not
be
able
to
get
through
for
by
now
jane
was
not
only
as
as
a
barrel
but
she
was
fully
as
what
with
so
much
happy
giggling
over
thomas
arrival
moreover
having
toppled
sidewise
she
like
a
barrel
a
barrel
upholstered
in
black
sateen
with
a
neat
touch
of
white
at
collar
and
cuffs
he
been
in
trouble
before
continued
the
policeman
stormily
but
time
and
letting
himself
down
flat
upon
his
head
he
shook
both
neatly
shod
feet
in
the
piper
face
it
was
now
that
gwendolyn
chanced
for
the
first
time
to
examine
the
latter
bundle
and
was
surprised
to
discover
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
large
of
the
fluffy
lacy
ribbony
sort
and
she
was
admiring
it
for
it
was
of
black
silk
and
handsome
something
within
it
stirred
she
retreated
until
the
and
the
kidnaper
knife
were
between
her
and
the
poke
had
we
better
be
she
faltered
nervously
the
piper
marked
her
manner
and
showed
instant
resentment
of
it
this
here
thing
was
handed
me
once
in
he
explained
and
i
ai
been
able
to
get
rid
of
it
since
every
single
day
it
harder
to
lug
around
because
you
see
he
growin
at
that
the
policeman
and
the
exchanged
a
glance
full
of
significance
and
both
shrugged
the
policeman
with
such
an
emphatic
shrug
that
his
shoulders
brushed
the
ground
gwendolyn
curiosity
emboldened
her
she
questioned
the
pig
pig
gwendolyn
pink
mouth
opened
in
amazement
here
was
the
very
pig
that
she
heard
in
a
poke
the
piper
was
glowering
at
jane
who
was
rocking
gently
from
side
to
side
displaying
first
one
face
then
the
other
well
call
that
dancing
he
declared
and
pulling
out
a
small
jotted
down
some
figures
gwendolyn
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
while
feeling
mistrust
toward
the
piper
and
abhorrence
toward
the
poke
and
its
contents
at
last
she
took
refuge
in
polite
inquiry
when
did
you
come
out
from
town
she
asked
the
piper
grunted
rather
or
was
it
the
pig
she
could
not
be
certain
and
colored
up
a
little
i
did
out
he
answered
in
his
surly
fashion
whereupon
he
fell
to
fitting
a
coupling
upon
the
ends
of
two
pipes
no
inquisitively
i
er
got
run
out
oh
again
the
policeman
and
the
exchanged
a
significant
glance
you
see
went
on
the
piper
in
the
city
everybody
in
debt
well
i
have
to
have
my
money
do
i
so
i
dunned
all
good
but
maybe
er
a
speck
much
so
oh
dear
breathed
gwendolyn
of
course
i
never
been
what
you
might
call
popular
who
be
if
everybody
owed
him
money
huh
snorted
the
policeman
you
overcharge
asserted
the
little
old
gentleman
gwendolyn
hastened
to
forestall
any
heated
reply
from
the
piper
you
do
think
your
pig
had
anything
to
do
with
it
she
suggested
considerately
do
do
people
like
pigs
the
pig
was
never
in
sight
asserted
the
piper
guess
that
one
reason
why
i
ca
sell
him
what
people
do
see
they
do
want
to
buy
even
when
it
covered
up
stylish
here
he
regarded
the
poke
with
an
expression
of
entire
satisfaction
the
little
company
was
well
on
its
way
by
now
though
gwendolyn
could
not
recall
the
moment
of
starting
the
piper
had
not
waited
to
be
invited
but
strolled
along
with
the
others
his
in
a
corner
of
his
mouth
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
the
at
his
elbow
thomas
left
to
get
jane
along
as
best
he
could
had
managed
most
ingeniously
the
nurse
was
cylindrical
all
he
had
to
do
therefore
was
to
give
her
momentum
over
the
smooth
windings
of
the
road
by
an
occasional
smart
shove
with
both
hands
which
made
it
clear
that
the
likelihood
of
losing
jane
of
leaving
her
behind
was
lessening
with
each
moment
for
now
the
more
the
nurse
laughed
easier
it
would
be
to
get
her
oh
dear
sighed
gwendolyn
with
a
sad
shake
of
her
yellow
head
as
jane
came
trundling
up
both
fat
arms
folded
to
keep
them
out
of
the
way
if
she
stopped
dancin
where
would
i
come
in
demanded
the
piper
resentfully
the
pig
moved
in
the
poke
he
trounced
the
poor
thing
irritably
the
now
began
to
speak
in
a
curious
chanting
fashion
the
mode
of
locomotion
adapted
by
this
woman
said
he
rather
adds
to
then
detracts
from
her
value
as
a
nurse
think
what
facilities
she
has
for
amusing
a
child
on
say
an
extensive
slope
of
lawn
and
her
ability
to
see
two
ways
practically
at
once
gives
her
further
value
would
ever
let
a
young
charge
fall
over
a
cliff
the
barrel
was
whopping
over
and
over
noiselessly
except
for
the
faint
chatter
of
jane
teeth
behind
it
was
thomas
by
now
and
perspiring
but
faithful
to
his
task
the
thing
whispered
gwendolyn
reaching
to
touch
a
ragged
sleeve
would
be
to
get
rid
of
thomas
then
she
the
policeman
heard
get
rid
of
thomas
he
repeated
easy
enough
on
the
she
looked
see
the
h
sure
enough
the
road
was
fairly
strewn
with
the
sixth
consonant
both
in
small
letters
and
capitals
been
dropped
went
on
the
officer
she
had
heard
the
expression
dropping
his
h
now
she
understood
it
oh
but
how
these
help
show
to
thomas
she
approached
the
barrel
and
pointed
down
thomas
followed
her
pointing
instantly
his
expression
became
furious
and
one
by
one
his
ears
stood
up
alertly
it
him
he
shouted
oh
wait
till
i
get
my
hands
on
him
then
heaving
hard
at
the
barrel
he
raced
off
along
the
alphabetical
trail
gwendolyn
was
compelled
to
run
to
keep
up
with
him
what
the
trouble
she
asked
the
a
dictionarial
difference
he
answered
his
face
very
grave
oh
she
resolved
to
hunt
dictionarial
up
the
moment
she
was
back
in
the
thomas
was
shouting
once
more
from
where
he
labored
in
the
lead
murder
him
he
threatened
this
time
i
him
murder
that
made
matters
clear
there
was
only
one
person
against
whom
thomas
bore
such
hot
it
the
king
english
she
panted
it
the
king
english
agreed
the
policeman
in
rapid
she
reached
again
to
tug
gently
at
a
ragged
sleeve
do
know
him
she
asked
the
round
black
eyes
of
the
little
old
gentleman
shone
proudly
down
at
her
all
nice
people
are
well
acquainted
with
the
king
english
he
declared
which
statement
she
had
often
heard
in
the
nursery
now
however
it
embarrassed
her
for
she
was
compelled
to
admit
to
herself
that
was
not
acquainted
with
the
king
english
and
he
a
personage
of
such
consequence
the
piper
hurried
alongside
all
his
pipes
rattling
just
where
are
we
goin
anyhow
he
asked
petulantly
we
going
to
the
bear
den
informed
the
and
here
the
zoo
now
announced
the
policeman
it
was
unmistakably
the
zoo
gwendolyn
recognized
the
main
entrance
for
above
it
in
monster
letters
formed
by
electric
lights
was
a
sign
bulbous
and
blinding
sites
borax
starch
so
is
the
gate
you
meant
she
called
to
the
policeman
the
gate
was
flung
invitingly
wide
thomas
rushed
toward
it
his
fourteen
ears
flopping
horribly
and
here
is
cried
the
policeman
on
guard
the
next
moment
ordered
a
harsh
voice
a
voice
with
an
english
accent
there
was
a
flash
of
scarlet
before
gwendolyn
face
of
scarlet
so
vivid
that
it
blinded
she
flung
up
a
hand
but
she
was
not
frightened
she
knew
what
it
was
and
rubbed
at
her
eyes
hastily
to
clear
them
he
stood
in
full
view
as
far
as
outward
appearance
was
concerned
he
was
exactly
the
looking
person
she
had
pictured
in
her
own
mind
young
and
tall
and
lusty
with
a
florid
countenance
and
hair
as
blonde
as
her
own
and
he
wore
the
uniform
of
an
english
soldier
short
coat
of
scarlet
all
gold
braid
and
brass
buttons
dark
trousers
with
stripes
and
a
little
round
cap
with
a
chin
strap
but
he
carried
no
cane
instead
as
he
stepped
forward
nose
up
chin
up
eyes
very
bold
he
swung
a
most
amazing
weapon
it
was
as
scarlet
as
his
own
coat
as
long
as
he
was
tall
and
polished
to
a
high
degree
but
it
was
not
unbending
like
a
sword
it
was
limber
to
whippiness
so
that
as
he
twirled
it
about
his
blonde
head
it
snapped
and
whistled
and
gwendolyn
remembered
having
seen
others
exactly
like
it
hanging
on
the
at
the
for
it
was
a
tongue
aw
mah
word
exclaimed
the
king
english
surveying
the
halted
group
gwendolyn
could
not
imagine
what
word
he
had
in
mind
but
she
thought
him
very
fine
with
his
air
of
proud
and
his
fine
brilliant
uniform
he
was
strikingly
like
her
own
toy
anxious
to
make
a
favorable
impression
upon
him
she
smoothed
the
gingham
dress
hastily
brushed
back
straying
wisps
of
yellow
straightened
her
shoulders
and
assumed
a
cordial
expression
of
countenance
how
do
you
do
she
said
curtseying
he
saluted
but
blocked
the
way
may
we
go
into
the
zoo
please
his
hand
jerked
down
to
his
side
one
at
a
time
he
answered
all
but
thomas
thomas
had
come
short
with
the
others
now
as
gwendolyn
looked
at
him
she
saw
that
he
also
was
armed
with
a
tongue
a
warped
and
twisted
affair
rough
but
thin
along
its
edges
if
you
try
to
keep
me
out
he
cried
i
certainly
murder
you
at
this
juncture
the
policeman
forward
and
took
his
station
at
the
left
of
the
gate
next
the
king
english
stepped
back
until
he
stood
at
the
right
between
them
hand
in
hand
once
more
passed
gwendolyn
and
the
the
piper
came
next
call
that
a
english
tongue
he
asked
with
an
impudent
grin
at
the
soldier
shining
weapon
yes
sir
pah
now
thomas
gave
jane
a
quick
shove
forward
but
a
shove
which
sent
her
only
as
far
as
the
gate
the
king
english
stared
down
at
her
how
are
you
he
said
coldly
i
awful
uncomfortable
was
the
mournful
answer
then
take
off
your
stays
he
advised
whereat
the
polished
tongue
glanced
through
the
light
caught
jane
fairly
around
the
waist
and
with
a
swift
recoil
brought
her
to
her
feet
and
now
gwendolyn
astonished
saw
that
too
much
laughter
had
again
remolded
that
sateen
bulk
the
nurse
had
grown
woefully
heavy
about
the
shoulders
which
put
a
fearful
strain
on
the
stitches
of
her
bodice
and
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
gigantic
as
she
swayed
a
moment
on
her
shoes
shoes
now
utterly
lacking
buttons
the
king
english
again
struck
out
caught
her
this
time
around
the
neck
and
sent
her
spinning
through
the
gate
she
laughed
dizzily
that
laugh
the
high
persistent
note
of
a
top
thomas
attempted
to
follow
i
just
come
in
he
cried
wielding
his
warped
weapon
with
a
flourish
you
shall
to
bar
the
way
the
king
english
thrust
out
his
polished
tongue
i
crack

thomas
saucily

at
a
brass
button
his
face
was
all
cunning
then
how
the
tongues
popped
this
is
i
corrected
the
king
english
promptly
but
his
face
got
a
trifle
more
florid

the
little
old
gentleman
i
hall

the

cried
back

gwendolyn

shifted
his
tobacco

from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
i
for
the
man
that
got

was
no

about

thomas
acted
upon

he
charged
haggle
and
halve
and
hamper
halt
and
hang
and
harass
and
and
struck
back
the
king
english
beginning
to
breath
hard
aggie
and
and
and
and
as
the
tongues
met
gwendolyn
saw
small
bright
splinters
fly
this
way
and
that
a
shower
of
them
these
splinters
darted
downward
falling
upon
the
road
and
each
as
it
lit
was
an

the
policeman
was
frightened
which
is
your
best
foot
he
called

king

then
put
it
forward
my
goodness
exclaimed
gwendolyn

scourged

the

the

panted
i
hall
right
has
long
has
grammar
does
get
too
bad
and
off
came
one
of
thomas
ears
a
large
one
and
blew
along
the
ground
like
a
great
leaf
that
was
an
unfortunate
boast
for
thomas
enraged
by
the
loss
of
an
ear
fought
with
renewed
zeal
if
you
see
he
just
tell
i
he
shouted
the
king
english
went
pallid
if
you

just
tell

he
gasped
meeting
thomas
gallantly
with
the
loss
of
only
one
splinter
oh
i
want
you
to
win
called
gwendolyn
to
him
but
the
contest
was
unequal
that
was
now
plain
the
king
english
had
polish
and
finish
thomas
had
more
his
tongue
newly
sharpened
cut
deep
at
each
blow
unequal
as
was
the
contest
jane
interference
a
second
time
made
it
more
so
for
as
the
fighters
trampled
to
and
fro
seeking
the
better
of
each
other
she
twirled
near
again
try
your
thomas
she
counseled
try
your
verbs
eagerly
thomas
grasped
this
second
hint
by
which
i
could
was
he
cried
with
a
curling
stroke
of
the
warped
tongue
or
shall
am
at
that
the
king
english
showed
distressing
weakness
he
seemed
scarcely
to
have
enough
strength
for
another
snap
by
i
could
be
he
whipped
back
feebly
or
shall
been
and
staggered
sidewise
now
the
warped
and
twisted
tongue
began
to
chant
i
done
i
done
i
done
implored
the
king
english
fairly
wan
friends
this
this
fellow
treated
me
houtrageously
for
for
yaaws
oh
worser
and
worser
and
worser
pursued
thomas
changing
suddenly
to
adverbs
rawly
now
the
king
english
tottered
to
his
knees
i
prompted
gwendolyn
eager
to
help
him
i
did
repeated
the
king
english
but
the
polished
tongue
slipped
from
his
grasp
i
seen
followed
up
thomas
i
sung
crack
it
was
the
last
fatal
onslaught
the
figure
fell
forward
yet
bravely
he
strove
again
to
give
for
by
reaching
out
one
palsied
hand
toward
his
weapon
i
i
he
muttered
i
and
expired
with
his
last
breath
gasping
good
grammar
instantly
thomas
leaped
the
prostrate
figure
and
strode
to
the
gate
he
was
breathing
hard
but
looking
about
him
boldly
now
come
through
he
boasted
it
was
gwendolyn
cry
officer
do
let
him
in
answer
to
her
appeal
the
policeman
seized
thomas
by
a
lower
ear
and
shoved
him
against
a
you
committed
murder
he
cried
and
i
arrest
you
him
shouted
the
little
old
gentleman
springing
to
jerk
thomas
weapon
out
of
his
hand
and
to
snatch
up
the
nicked
and
splintered
weapon
of
the
vanquished
soldier
under
the
great
blazing
sign
of
the
zoo
entrance
the
capture
was
accomplished
and
in
a
moment
from
his
feet
to
his
very
ears
thomas
was
wrapped
arms
tight
against
sides
in
the
scarlet
toils
of
the
tongues
so
exclaimed
the
little
old
gentleman
as
he
tied
a
last
knot
thomas
never
bother
my
little
girl
again
and
taking
gwendolyn
by
the
hand
he
led
her
away
it
was
not
until
she
had
gone
some
distance
that
she
turned
to
take
a
last
look
back
and
saw
there
beside
the
wide
gate
a
its
long
leaves
waving
gently
it
was
thomas
bound
securely
and
abandoned
yet
she
did
not
pity
him
he
had
murdered
the
king
english
and
he
deserved
his
punishment
furthermore
he
looked
so
green
so
cool
so
ornamental
chapter
xiii
so
far
the
piper
had
seemed
to
be
no
one
friend
unless
perhaps
his
own
he
had
lagged
along
surly
or
boisterous
by
turns
and
careless
of
his
manners
not
even
showing
respect
to
the
and
the
policeman
but
now
gwendolyn
remarked
a
change
in
him
for
as
he
spoke
to
her
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
under
the
pretext
of
cleaning
it
say
he
began
in
a
cautious
undertone
i
give
you
some
advice
about
jane
gwendolyn
was
looking
about
her
at
the
zoo
its
roofs
seemed
countless
they
touched
having
no
streets
between
them
anywhere
and
reached
as
far
as
she
could
see
they
were
all
heights
all
shapes
all
varieties
some
being
level
others
coming
to
a
point
at
one
corner
a
few
ending
in
a
tower
one
tower
on
the
edge
of
the
zoo
was
square
and
tapered
jane
she
said
indifferently
oh
she
only
a
top
only
a
top
it
was
the
little
old
gentleman
why
that
makes
her
all
the
dangerous
because
she
spinning
so
fast
the
policeman
balanced
on
one
arm
while
he
shook
an
emphatic
finger
that
she
stir
up
trouble
well
then
what
shall
i
do
asked
gwendolyn
for
elated
over
seeing
thomas
disposed
of
so
completely
and
yet
with
so
much
mercy
she
was
impatient
at
hearing
that
she
still
had
reason
to
fear
the
nurse
the
piper
took
his
time
about
replying
he
sharpened
one
end
of
a
match
thrust
the
bit
of
pine
into
the
stem
of
his
pipe
jabbed
away
industriously
threw
away
the
match
blew
through
the
stem
once
or
twice
and
turned
the
bowl
upside
down
to
make
it
against
a
palm
then
keep
jane
laughin
he
counseled
see
what
jane
was
alongside
spinning
comfortably
on
her
point
now
as
if
she
had
overheard
or
guessed
a
plot
sudden
uneasiness
showed
on
both
her
countenances
and
she
increased
her
speed
you
done
up
thomas
the
lot
of
you
she
charged
as
she
whirled
away
but
you
do
git
and
we
wo
declared
gwendolyn
if
we
do
hurry
up
and
trip
her
a
idear
chimed
in
the
piper
if
we
only
had
some
string
cried
the
little
old
gentleman
string
wo
do
said
the
policeman
we
need
rope
there
was
a
high
wind
sweeping
the
roofs
and
as
the
three
began
to
run
about
searching
it
fluttered
the
policeman
swelled
out
the
piper
cap
and
tugged
at
the
ragged
garb
of
the
here
a
piece
of
the
policeman
made
the
find
catching
sight
of
the
line
where
it
dangled
from
the
edge
of
a
roof
the
others
hastened
to
join
him
and
each
seized
the
rope
in
both
hands
the
piper
staying
at
one
end
of
it
the
little
old
gentleman
at
the
opposite
while
gwendolyn
and
the
policeman
posted
themselves
at
proper
distances
between
then
forward
in
a
row
swept
all
carrying
the
rope
with
them
it
was
a
curious
one
of
its
kind
as
black
as
if
it
had
been
tarred
thick
at
the
middle
but
noticeably
thin
at
one
end
jane
saw
their
design
she
mocked
not
afraid
of
you
i
goin
to
turn
the
big
rock
you
see
and
she
made
straight
toward
the
square
tower
in
the
distance
it
was
the
little
old
gentleman
beard
blown
sidewise
by
the
wind
we
mus
let
her
the
piper
in
his
excitement
jounced
the
pig
so
hard
that
it
squealed
we
ought
to
be
able
he
panted
to
manage
a
top
jane
bellowed
the
policeman
galloping
hard
you
must
injure
that
shaft
then
gwendolyn
realized
that
the
square
toward
which
the
nurse
was
spinning
was
the
big
rock
and
she
recognized
it
as
a
certain
great
pillar
of
pink
granite
up
and
down
the
sides
of
which
deep
cut
by
chisels
were
written
strange
words
it
rose
just
ahead
answering
the
officer
with
a
shrill
scoffing
laugh
jane
bore
down
upon
it
aided
by
the
wind
she
made
top
speed
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
her
pursuers
fairly
tore
after
her
and
the
piper
who
made
the
fastest
progress
gained
until
he
was
at
her
very
heels
then
with
a
final
leap
he
passed
her
and
circled
dragging
the
rope
it
made
a
loop
about
the
buttonless
shoes
a
loop
that
tightened
as
the
little
old
gentleman
came
short
as
the
piper
halted
each
gave
a
pull
with
disastrous
result
for
as
the
line
came
taut
up
jane
went
caught
bodily
from
the
ground
and
still
spinning
whizzed
forward
in
that
high
wind
and
struck
the
granite
squarely
she
fell
to
the
ground
toppling
sidewise
and
bulking
large
but
the
shaft
it
began
to
move
slowly
at
first
to
tip
forward
farther
and
farther
when
gaining
velocity
with
a
great
grinding
noise
down
from
off
the
massive
cube
upon
which
it
stood
it
came
crashing
instantly
a
chorus
of
cries
arose
oh
she
bumped
over
the
obelisk
she
bumped
over
the
obelisk
with
the
cries
and
sounding
from
beneath
the
tapered
end
of
the
big
rock
mingled
ferocious
growls
rar
rar
rar
and
in
that
same
moment
the
four
who
were
holding
the
rope
felt
it
begin
to
writhe
and
twist
in
their
grasp
a
live
and
its
black
length
took
on
a
scaly
look
glittering
in
that
pink
glow
as
if
it
were
covered
with
small
ebon
it
grew
cold
and
clammy
at
its
thicker
end
gwendolyn
saw
that
the
piper
was
supporting
a
head
a
head
with
small
fiery
eyes
and
a
tongue
in
its
color
and
swift
darting
next
and
with
one
hideous
contortion
the
huge
black
body
wrung
itself
free
and
coiled
once
gwendolyn
had
boasted
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
snakes
and
now
she
did
not
flee
though
the
black
coils
were
piled
at
her
very
feet
for
she
recognized
the
serpent
there
was
no
mistaking
that
thin
face
and
those
small
eyes
moreover
a
was
bound
round
the
reptilian
jaws
and
tied
at
the
top
of
the
head
in
a
she
had
gotten
rid
of
thomas
but
here
was
miss
royle
there
was
no
time
for
greetings
again
were
sounding
those
furious
growls
rar
rar
jane
swung
round
in
a
to
warn
the
governess
it
that
bear
she
hummed
ca
you
drive
him
away
miss
royle
began
to
uncoil
the
policeman
was
up
and
down
the
den
damaged
he
lamented
who
goin
to
pay
demanded
the
piper
i
afraid
the
bear
hurt
declared
the
in
her
eagerness
to
trip
jane
gwendolyn
had
utterly
forgotten
the
bear
den
now
she
saw
it
a
large
cage
light
in
color
its
bars
woven
closely
together
and
she
saw
too
with
horror
that
what
the
policeman
said
was
true
in
falling
the
big
rock
had
broken
the
cover
of
the
den
this
cover
was
flopping
up
and
down
on
its
hinges
oh
he
loose
she
gasped
rar
the
bear
himself
was
knocking
the
cover
into
the
air
the
top
of
his
head
could
be
seen
as
he
hopped
about
evidently
in
pain
and
now
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
a
black
glittering
body
shot
rustling
through
the
grass
to
the
side
of
the
den
then
up
went
a
scaly
head
and
forth
darted
a
flaming
tongue
driving
the
bear
back
under
the
cover
at
which
the
bear
rebelled
for
his
growls
turned
into
a
muffled
protest
now
you
stop
miss
royle
i
be
treated
like
this
i
then
gwendolyn
understood
jane
hum
and
why
the
governess
had
obeyed
it
so
swiftly
the
cage
with
the
loose
cover
was
nothing
else
than
the
old
as
for
the
bear
hair
flying
cheeks
crimson
eyes
shining
with
quick
tears
of
joy
she
darted
past
jane
leaped
the
glittering
before
the
hamper
and
swung
the
cover
up
on
its
hinges
puffy
she
cried
oh
puffy
it
was
indeed
puffy
with
his
plushy
brown
head
his
bright
eyes
his
sharply
pointed
nose
his
adorably
tiny
ears
and
tightly
shut
determined
mouth
it
was
puffy
as
dear
as
ever
as
old
and
as
squashy
he
stood
up
in
the
hamper
to
look
at
her
leaning
his
front
paws
in
rather
a
dignified
manner
on
the
broken
edge
of
the
basketry
he
was
breathing
hard
from
his
contest
but
smiling
nevertheless
ah
said
he
affably
the
poor
little
rich
girl
i
see
gwendolyn
first
impulse
was
to
take
him
up
in
her
arms
but
his
proud
air
combined
with
the
fact
that
he
had
grown
tremendously
caused
her
to
check
the
impulse
how
do
you
do
she
inquired
politely
i
pretty
shabby
thank
you
oh
it
good
to
hear
your
voice
again
she
exclaimed
when
you
left
i
did
have
a
chance
to
tell
you
it
was
then
that
she
noticed
a
white
something
fluttering
at
his
breast
just
under
his
left
excuse
me
she
said
apologetically
but
are
you
losing
your
pocket
handkerchief
sadly
he
shook
his
head
it
my
stuffing
he
explained
and
gently
withdrawing
his
paw
from
her
eager
grasp
laid
it
upon
his
breast
you
see
the
big
rock
the
little
old
gentleman
was
beside
him
examining
the
wound
muttering
to
himself
can
you
mend
him
asked
gwendolyn
oh
puffy
the
little
old
gentleman
began
to
empty
his
pockets
of
the
articles
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
the
ear
the
handful
of
hair
the
plump
cheek
ah
ah
he
breathed
as
he
examined
each
one
and
to
and
fro
wagged
the
grizzled
beard
i
afraid
i
must
have
help
this
is
a
case
that
will
require
a
specialist
the
tone
was
so
solemn
that
it
frightened
her
oh
do
you
mean
we
need
a
puffy
was
trembling
weakly
i
lost
some
once
before
he
to
gwendolyn
it
was
when
you
were
teething
oh
i
know
it
was
unintentional
you
were
little
but
i
ca
spare
any
more
down
into
the
went
her
hand
out
came
the
she
thrust
it
into
his
furry
grasp
keep
this
she
bade
till
i
come
back
go
for
the
doctor
the
leaned
down
fly
he
urged
at
that
jane
began
to
circle
once
more
lovie
she
hummed
do
you
go
he
give
you
nasty
medicine
chimed
in
miss
royle
her
bandaged
head
rising
and
lowering
in
assent
he
cut
out
your
appendix
one
moment
she
hesitated
feeling
the
old
fear
drive
the
blood
from
her
cheeks
to
her
wildly
beating
heart
then
she
saw
puffy
sway
half
fainting
and
obeying
the
command
of
the
little
old
gentleman
she
grasped
her
gingham
dress
at
either
side
held
it
out
to
its
fullest
width
and
with
the
wind
pouching
the
little
skirt
left
the
high
grass
passed
up
through
the
lights
of
the
nearby
trees
and
rose
into
the
higher
air
she
gave
a
glance
down
as
she
went
how
excitedly
jane
was
circling
how
miss
royle
was
lashing
the
ground
but
the
faces
of
the
other
three
were
smiling
encouragement
and
she
flew
for
her
very
life
lightly
she
went
as
if
there
were
nothing
to
her
but
her
little
gingham
dress
as
if
that
empty
dress
having
tugged
at
some
swagging
until
it
was
free
were
now
being
wafted
across
the
roofs
the
the
smooth
windings
of
a
road
to
a
without
doubt
for
her
nostrils
caught
the
good
smell
of
fresh
bread
suddenly
the
shop
loomed
ahead
of
her
she
alighted
to
have
a
look
at
it
it
was
a
round
high
stone
building
with
stone
steps
leading
up
to
it
from
every
side
and
columns
ranged
in
a
circle
at
the
top
of
the
steps
seated
on
the
bottom
step
engrossed
in
some
task
was
a
man
as
gwendolyn
looked
at
him
she
told
herself
that
the
had
given
this
customer
such
a
nice
face
the
eyes
in
particular
were
kind
he
had
a
large
pan
of
beside
him
out
of
it
now
he
gouged
a
spoonful
which
he
began
to
roll
between
his
palms
and
as
he
rolled
the
dough
it
became
rounder
and
rounder
until
it
was
it
turned
browner
and
browner
too
precisely
as
if
it
were
baking
in
his
hands
when
he
was
finished
with
it
he
piled
it
to
one
side
atop
other
brown
pellets
she
advanced
to
speak
please
she
began
pointing
a
small
finger
what
is
this
place
he
glanced
up
this
little
girl
is
the
pillery
the
pillery
instantly
she
knew
what
he
was
making
and
the
helped
her
to
recognize
him
she
dimpled
cordially
i
have
seen
you
since
i
had
the
colic
she
said
nodding
but
i
know
you
you
the
doctor
the
doctor
was
most
cordial
shaking
her
hand
gently
after
which
naturally
enough
he
felt
her
pulse
but
there
nothing
the
matter
with
she
protested
it
my
dear
puffy
remember
now
he
rose
solemnly
selected
a
pill
bowed
to
the
right
again
to
the
left
last
of
all
to
her
and
presented
the
pill
in
that
case
miss
gwendolyn
he
said
smiling
down
a
toast
and
quite
in
contrast
to
the
evening
of
her
seventh
birthday
anniversary
toast
there
deliciously
crisp
and
crunchy
oo
how
good
she
exclaimed
not
nibbling
conventionally
but
taking
big
bites
i
hate
cake
the
next
moment
she
became
aware
of
the
munching
of
others
and
on
looking
round
found
that
she
was
back
at
the
den
she
was
not
surprised
things
had
a
way
of
coming
to
pass
in
a
pleasantly
instantaneous
fashion
and
she
was
glad
to
see
the
little
old
gentleman
the
piper
and
the
policeman
each
fairly
gobbling
up
a
pellet
miss
royle
was
eating
too
and
jane
was
stuffing
mouths
but
puffy
was
having
quite
different
fare
in
front
of
him
stood
the
doctor
busily
feeding
filmy
white
bits
into
the
tear
just
under
a
i
think
you
find
assured
the
latter
that
a
proper
amount
of
is
most
refreshing
once
i
wanted
jane
to
take
me
to
the
doll
hospital
complained
puffy
his
eyes
hard
with
resentment
but
she
said
i
was
only
a
little
beast
gwendolyn
looked
severe
jane
you
be
sorry
for
that
she
scolded
my
dear
said
the
addressing
the
nurse
at
last
one
of
your
chickens
is
coming
home
to
roost
gwendolyn
glanced
up
and
sure
enough
a
chicken
going
past
a
small
blue
hen
who
looked
exceedingly
fagged
this
was
an
occurrence
worth
noting
how
often
had
she
heard
the
selfsame
remark
and
never
seen
as
much
as
a
feather
jane
also
saw
the
blue
hen
and
appeared
much
disconcerted
i
think
i
take
forty
winks
she
hummed
twenty
for
the
front
face
and
twenty
for
the
back
whereupon
she
made
a
few
quick
revolutions
landing
up
against
the
granite
base
of
the
obelisk
the
doctor
had
been
sewing
up
the
tear
in
puffy
coat
now
he
finished
his
seam
and
knotted
the
thread
there
said
he
cheerily
you
as
good
as
new
thank
you
said
puffy
and
i
feel
so
grateful
to
you
miss
gwendolyn
that
i
must
repay
your
kindness
you
always
heard
a
certain
statement
about
jane
yonder
well
i
going
to
prove
that
what
true
asked
gwendolyn
puzzled
he
made
no
answer
but
after
a
short
whispered
conference
with
the
policeman
turned
his
back
and
began
sniffing
and
snarling
under
his
breath
while
a
was
busy
in
the
region
of
his
third
rib
when
he
faced
round
again
the
eyes
were
shining
triumphantly
and
he
was
holding
both
together
tightly
i
found
one
he
cried
and
wabbling
over
to
jane
stationed
himself
on
one
side
of
her
at
the
same
time
motioning
the
officer
to
steal
round
to
the
other
side
on
quiet
hands
and
now
gwendolyn
saw
that
jane
though
she
was
only
feigning
sleep
was
ignorant
of
what
was
happening
for
her
double
equipment
of
faces
had
its
disadvantages
even
when
upright
she
had
not
been
able
to
roll
one
eye
forward
while
its
mate
was
on
guard
in
the
rear
and
reclining
flat
upon
her
back
she
could
not
rumble
her
eyes
forward
to
her
front
face
for
the
reason
that
they
would
not
roll
both
stayed
in
the
back
of
her
head
where
they
could
see
only
the
ground
very
cautiously
puffy
put
his
to
jane
ear
suddenly
separated
them
and
waited
a
moment
then
well
finding
out
you
can
wager
i
do
stay
heels
over
head
no
more
cried
the
policeman
and
with
a
wriggle
and
a
twist
and
a
bound
he
gave
a
half
somersault
and
stood
on
his
feet
at
once
the
bottoms
of
his
came
down
over
his
shoes
his
fell
about
him
properly
uncovering
his
shield
and
his
belt
and
his
club
took
its
place
at
his
right
side
ouch
he
exclaimed
and
began
to
scratch
hard
at
the
spot
just
between
his
at
the
same
time
the
tears
that
were
in
his
cap
flowed
out
and
down
his
face
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
weeping
the
doctor
leaning
close
beside
gwendolyn
was
all
sympathy
there
is
no
reason
to
feel
bad
he
said
kindly
the
operation
was
successful
feel
bad
repeated
the
policeman
why
i
ha
ha
we
put
a
flea
in
her
ear
at
that
jane
began
to
laugh
oh
laws
she
exclaimed
sleeve
to
mouth
once
more
oh
i
never
heard
the
like
of
it
growled
puffy
delighted
the
plan
is
working
see
her
growl
that
flea
went
in
one
ear
and
came
out
the
other
declared
the
little
old
gentleman
poking
jane
with
the
toe
of
a
worn
shoe
jane
laughed
the
harder
oh
it
awful
funny
she
cried
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
steadily
increasing
her
girth
oh
oh
oh
we
proved
that
you
said
puffy
and
now
the
nurse
was
seized
by
a
very
paroxysm
of
mirth
both
faces
distorted
she
whopped
over
and
over
that
right
split
your
sides
alaughin
cried
the
piper
at
these
words
sudden
terror
showed
on
her
face
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
trap
into
which
she
had
been
led
yet
she
could
not
check
her
laughter
oh
ho
she
gasped
hysterically
it
was
her
last
black
sateen
could
stand
no
more
she
gave
a
final
and
feeble
rock
both
revolving
faces
paled
then
there
sounded
a
loud
like
the
bursting
of
an
automobile
tire
next
a
ripping
look
cried
gwendolyn
there
were
great
rents
down
the
front
seams
of
jane
waist
the
nurse
guessed
what
had
happened
and
clutched
desperately
at
the
gaping
seams
with
both
fat
hands
now
in
front
now
at
the
sides
striving
to
hold
the
rips
together
to
no
avail
all
the
laughter
was
gone
out
of
her
quickly
she
collapsed
her
sateen
hanging
in
loose
ragged
strips
once
more
she
was
just
ordinary
size
oh
will
she
die
asked
gwendolyn
anxiously
the
doctor
knelt
to
grasp
jane
wrist
no
he
answered
gravely
she
only
have
to
go
back
to
the
employment
agency
i
wo
cried
jane

understand
hissed
back
the
snake
gwendolyn
was
troubled
now
the
policeman
and
the
piper
assisted
by
puffy
picked
the
nurse
up
and
packed
her
into
the
whereupon
the
little
old
gentleman
slapped
down
the
cover
and
tied
a
large
tag
to
it
on
the
tag
was
written
agency

done

gwendolyn
if
she

perfectly
good
top

jane
calling
through
the
weave
of
the
hamper
but
how
about

send
her
back
too
declared
the
here
where
you
he
ran
about
searching
the
others
searched
also
through
the
grass
behind
the
granite
shift
everywhere
concern
sobered
each
face
for
the

chapter
xiv
why
had
miss
royle
sly
reptile
that
she
was
scuttled
away
without
so
much
as
a
oh
dear
sighed
gwendolyn
just
as
soon
as
one
trouble
finished
another
one
starts
we
must
get
on
her
track
declared
the
policeman
patroling
to
and
fro
anxiously
and
let
hurry
urged
the
it
coming
night
in
the
city
and
all
these
lights
be
needed
soon
very
soon
indeed
for
even
as
he
spoke
it
happened
with
a
sharp
click
instantly
the
pink
glow
was
blotted
out
as
suddenly
thick
blackness
shut
down
except
straight
ahead
there
gwendolyn
made
out
an
oblong
patch
of
sky
in
which
were
a
few
dim
stars
never
mind
went
on
the
little
old
gentleman
soothingly
because
we
close
to
the
place
where
there
light
all
the
time
the
time
repeated
gwendolyn
surprised
it
where
light
grows
well
it
where
grows
she
cried
you
mean
oh
it
where
my
comes
sometimes
will
he
be
there
now
only
the
bird
can
tell
us
that
then
she
understood
jane
last
gasping
admonition
get
out
of
the
way
a
certain
person
must
talk
to
it
if
she
does
find
it
was
the
doctor
hand
that
steadied
her
as
she
hurried
forward
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
big
hand
and
she
was
able
to
grasp
only
two
fingers
of
it
but
that
clinging
hold
made
her
feel
that
their
friendship
was
established
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
her
complete
change
of
attitude
toward
him
it
seemed
to
her
now
as
if
he
and
she
had
always
been
on
good
terms
the
others
were
near
she
could
hear
the
of
the
pipes
the
scuff
of
puffy
paws
the
labored
breathing
of
the
little
old
gentleman
as
he
trudged
the
heavy
tramp
tramp
of
the
policeman
she
made
her
bare
feet
travel
as
fast
as
she
could
and
kept
her
look
steadily
ahead
on
the
dim
stars
and
saw
moving
from
one
to
another
of
them
in
quick
darts
now
up
now
down
a
small
something
she
did
not
instantly
guess
what
it
was
flitting
across
that
sky
until
she
heard
the
wild
beating
of
tiny
pinions
why
it
a
bird
she
exclaimed
a
bird
repeated
the
policeman
all
eagerness
must
be
bird
declared
the
triumphantly
it
was
even
in
the
poor
light
her
eager
eyes
made
out
the
bumps
on
that
small
feathered
head
and
saw
that
on
the
tail
nicely
balanced
and
gleaming
whitely
was
a
lump
remembering
what
she
had
heard
about
that
bit
of
salt
she
ran
forward
at
her
approach
his
wings
and
as
she
reached
out
to
him
pointing
a
small
finger
he
sprang
sidewise
alighting
upon
it
oh
i
glad
you
come
he
panted
he
was
no
larger
than
a
canary
and
seemed
to
be
brown
a
prejudiced
against
him
she
had
been
he
had
tattled
about
her
about
her
father
yet
seeing
him
now
so
tiny
and
ruffled
and
frightened
she
liked
him
she
brought
him
to
a
level
with
her
eyes
what
the
matter
she
asked
soothingly
i
afraid
he
thrust
out
his
head
pointing
she
looked
ahead
the
tops
of
the
grass
blades
were
swaying
this
way
and
that
in
a
winding
path
as
if
from
the
passage
of
some
crawling
thing
she
tried
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
oh
tell
me
where
is
my
why
of
they
say
he
he
did
not
finish
or
if
he
did
she
heard
no
end
to
the
sentence
of
a
sudden
her
face
had
grown
almost
painfully
hot
as
a
great
yellow
light
flamed
against
it
a
light
that
shimmered
up
dazzlingly
from
the
surface
of
a
broad
treeless
field
this
field
was
like
none
that
she
had
ever
imagined
for
its
acres
were
neatly
sodded
with
the
little
company
was
on
the
beveled
edge
of
the
field
to
halt
them
and
conspicuously
displayed
was
a
sign
it
read
off
the
off
the
glass
read
gwendolyn
and
i
do
wonder
crack
it
we
do
crack
it
we
cross
it
reminded
the
and
stepped
boldly
upon
the
gleaming
plate
my
my
exclaimed
the
piper
ai
there
a
crop
this
year
a
fine
crop
gwendolyn
glanced
down
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
the
mirrored
acres
were
studded
with
countless
candles
what
curious
candles
they
were
they
did
not
grow
horizontally
as
she
had
imagined
they
must
but
upright
and
above
their
sticks
which
were
of
brass
silver
and
decorated
porcelain
was
a
flame
ruddy
of
tip
sharply
pointed
but
fat
and
yellow
at
the
base
where
the
soft
white
wax
fed
the
fire
at
the
other
end
of
the
sticks
as
like
the
top
light
as
if
it
were
a
perfect
reflection
was
a
second
flame
these
were
candles
that
burned
both
and
this
was
the
region
she
had
traveled
so
far
to
find
her
heart
beat
so
wildly
that
it
stirred
the
plaid
of
the
little
gingham
dress
say
i
hear
a
quacking
announced
puffy
staring
up
into
the
sky
gwendolyn
heard
it
too
it
seemed
to
come
from
across
the
field
of
candles
she
peered
that
way
to
where
a
heavy
fringe
of
trees
walled
the
farther
side
greenily
she
saw
him
first
while
the
others
excepting
the
bird
were
still
staring
skyward
at
the
start
what
she
discerned
was
only
a
faint
outline
on
the
the
outline
of
a
man
tall
but
a
trifle
stooped
it
was
faint
for
the
reason
that
it
blended
with
the
trees
for
the
man
was
garbed
in
green
as
he
advanced
into
the
field
the
chorus
of
quacks
grew
louder
and
presently
gwendolyn
caught
certain
familiar
expressions
oh
bozzer
me
sit
up
straight
miss
sit
up
straight
this
a
rather
deep
quack
my
dear
child
you
have
no
sense
of
time
and
what
on
earth
ever
put
such
a
question
into
your
head
she
concluded
that
the
expressions
were
issuing
from
the
large
horn
which
was
pointed
her
way
over
one
shoulder
of
the
man
in
green
the
to
which
the
horn
was
attached
a
handsome
mahogany
affair
he
carried
on
his
back
it
was
not
unlike
a
which
made
gwendolyn
wonder
if
he
was
not
the
brother
she
glanced
back
inquiringly
at
the
little
old
gentleman
either
the
stranger
a
relation
and
not
a
popular
one
or
else
the
quacking
expressions
annoyed
for
the
was
scowling
and
cavil
criticism
correction
he
scolded
half
to
himself
he
in
green
now
began
to
move
about
and
gather
candles
bending
this
way
and
that
to
pluck
them
and
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
group
of
watchers
in
plain
view
but
not
one
of
these
was
indifferent
to
presence
and
all
were
acting
in
a
most
incomprehensible
manner
with
one
accord
doctor
and
piper
bear
and
policeman
and
bird
were
rubbing
hard
at
the
palm
of
one
hand
there
being
no
trees
close
by
the
men
used
the
sole
of
a
shoe
while
puffy
raked
away
at
one
paw
with
the
claws
of
the
others
and
the
bird
pecked
a
foot
with
his
beak
and
yet
gwendolyn
could
not
believe
that
it
was
really
the
policeman
drew
near
you
heard
of
hobson
choice
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
this
is
hobson
or
sam
hill
or
punch
or
great
scott
the
shook
his
head
you
do
know
him
he
answered
because
recently
when
the
bears
were
bothering
him
a
lot
in
his
street
i
made
him
a
long
face
the
man
in
green
was
pausing
where
the
candles
clustered
thickest
gwendolyn
still
doubtful
went
forward
to
greet
him
how
do
you
do
sir
she
began
curtseying
his
face
was
long
as
the
had
pointed
out
very
long
and
pale
and
haggard
between
his
sunken
temples
burned
his
eyes
his
nose
was
thin
and
over
it
the
skin
was
drawn
so
tightly
that
his
nostrils
were
pinched
his
lips
were
pressed
together
driving
out
the
blood
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
shadowed
bluely
by
a
beard
he
had
on
a
hat
yet
she
was
able
curiously
enough
to
note
that
his
hair
was
sparse
over
the
top
of
his
head
and
streaked
with
gray
nevertheless
there
was
no
denying
that
she
recognized
him
dimly
something
knotted
in
her
throat
at
seeing
weariness
anxiety
even
torture
in
those
eyes
i
think
i
met
you
before
somewhere
she
faltered
your
your
long
face
the
bird
was
perched
on
the
forefinger
of
one
hand
she
proffered
the
other
he
did
not
even
look
at
her
my
hands
are
full
he
declared
and
again
my
hands
are
full
she
glanced
at
them
and
saw
that
each
was
indeed
full
of
paper
money
moreover
the
green
of
his
coat
was
the
green
of
new
crisp
bills
while
his
trousers
were
made
of
yellowish
ones
carefully
creased
he
was
literally
of
now
she
felt
reasonably
certain
of
his
identity
yet
she
determined
to
make
even
more
sure
would
you
mind
just
turning
around
for
a
moment
she
inquired
but
i
busy
he
protested
i
ca
be
bothered
with
little
girls
i
see
you
when
you
eight
years
old
nevertheless
he
faced
about
accommodatingly
the
moment
he
turned
his
back
he
displayed
a
detail
of
his
dress
that
had
not
been
visible
before
this
detail
at
first
glance
appeared
to
be
a
smart
leather
piping
on
second
glance
it
seemed
a
sort
of
contrivance
by
which
the
was
suspended
but
in
the
end
she
knew
what
it
was
a
leather
harness
an
exceedingly
handsome
harness
she
went
around
him
and
raised
a
smiling
face
caught
at
a
hand
too
and
felt
her
own
happy
tears
make
cool
streaks
down
her
cheeks
i
i
do
see
you
often
she
said
i
know
you
just
the
same
you
you
my
at
that
he
glanced
down
at
her
stooped
picked
a
candle
and
held
it
close
to
her
face
poor
little
girl
he
said
poor
little
girl
poor
little
girl
she
prompted
noting
that
he
had
left
out
the
word
she
heard
a
sob
the
next
moment
rustle
rustle
and
at
her
feet
the
candles
were
bent
this
way
and
that
as
miss
royle
with
an
artful
on
her
bandaged
face
writhed
her
way
swiftly
between
them
dearie
she
hissed
making
an
affectionate
about
gwendolyn
what
you
think
i
going
to
say
to
you
gwendolyn
only
shook
her
head
darling
encouraged
the
governess
coiling
herself
a
little
closer
maybe
you
going
to
say
your
dictionary
ventured
gwendolyn
oh
dearie
chided
miss
royle
managing
a
very
good
blush
for
a
snake
but
now
gwendolyn
guessed
the
reason
for
the
other
sudden
display
of
affection
for
that
scaly
head
was
rising
out
of
the
grass
inch
by
inch
and
those
glittering
serpent
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
bird
unable
to
move
he
watched
her
plumage
on
end
round
eyes
fairly
starting
cheep
at
his
cry
of
terror
the
doctor
interposed
i
think
we
better
take
the
bird
out
of
here
he
said
the
less
noise
the
better
and
with
that
he
lifted
the
small
frightened
thing
from
gwendolyn
finger
miss
royle
quite
thrown
off
her
poise
sank
hissing
to
the
ground
my
neuralgia
worse
than
ever
this
evening
she
complained
affecting
not
to
notice
his
interference
huh
he
grunted
keep
away
from
bargain
counters
the
piper
came
jangling
up
that
snake
belongs
in
her
case
he
declared
addressing
the
doctor
more
than
once
gwendolyn
had
wondered
why
the
piper
had
burdened
himself
to
all
appearances
uselessly
and
foolishly
with
the
various
pieces
of
lead
pipe
but
now
what
wily
forethought
she
granted
him
for
with
a
few
quick
flourishes
of
the
wrench
she
saw
him
join
them
end
to
end
to
form
one
length
this
he
threw
to
the
ground
after
which
he
gave
a
short
sharp
whistle
in
answer
to
it
the
bird
fluttered
down
and
entered
one
end
of
the
pipe
giving
as
he
disappeared
from
sight
one
faint
cheep
miss
royle
heard
her
scaly
head
glittered
up
once
more
her
beady
eyes
shone
her
tongue
darted
hate
then
little
by
little
that
long
black
body
began
to
move
toward
the
pipe
a
moment
and
she
entered
it
another
and
the
last
foot
of
rustling
serpent
had
disappeared
then
out
of
the
farther
end
of
the
pipe
bounced
the
bird
whereat
the
piper
sprang
to
the
bird
side
produced
a
nut
and
screwed
it
on
the
how
that
he
cried
triumphantly
the
pipe
rolled
partly
over
a
muffled
voice
came
from
it
railing
at
him
be
careful
what
you
do
young
man
saw
you
had
that
bonnet
of
mine
oh
can
a
snake
crawl
backwards
demanded
gwendolyn
excitedly
the
piper
answered
with
a
harsh
laugh
and
scrambling
the
length
of
the
lead
pipe
fell
to
hammering
in
a
plug
miss
royle
was
a
prisoner
the
bird
bounced
very
high
that
a
feather
in
cap
he
declared
joyously
advancing
to
the
piper
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
pulled
a
tiny
plume
from
his
own
wing
fluttered
up
and
thrust
it
under
the
band
of
the
other
greasy
think
how
that
governess
has
treated
me
growled
puffy
when
i
was
in
your
nursery
and
was
old
and
a
little
worn
out
i
appreciated
care
and
repair
the
employment
agency
for
her
said
the
piper
i
attend
to
that
added
the
policeman
gwendolyn
father
had
been
gathering
candles
and
had
seemed
not
to
see
what
was
transpiring
now
as
if
he
was
satisfied
with
his
load
he
suddenly
started
away
in
the
direction
he
had
come
his
firm
stride
jolted
the
not
a
little
the
quacking
cries
recommenced
please
to
pay
me
let
me
sell
you
let
me
borrow
wo
you
hire
quack
quack
after
him
hurried
the
others
in
an
excited
group
the
piper
led
it
his
jangling
his
and
gwendolyn
saw
him
grin
back
over
a
shoulder
craftily
then
lay
hold
of
her
father
and
a
she
trudged
in
the
rear
she
had
found
her
father
and
he
could
see
only
the
candles
he
sought
and
the
money
in
his
grasp
she
was
out
in
the
open
with
him
once
more
where
she
was
free
to
gambol
and
shout
yet
he
was
bound
by
his
harness
and
heavily
laden
i
might
just
as
well
be
home
she
said
to
puffy
disheartened
wish
your
father
let
me
sharpen
his
ears
whispered
the
he
shifted
the
to
the
other
shoulder
the
doctor
had
a
basket
on
his
arm
he
peered
into
it
i
have
a
thing
about
me
he
declared
but
a
how
would
a
glass
of
do
suggested
the
policeman
in
an
undertone
why
of
it
had
happened
before
that
the
mere
mention
of
a
thing
brought
that
dying
swiftly
now
it
happened
again
for
immediately
gwendolyn
heard
the
rush
and
bubble
and
brawl
of
a
narrow
next
looking
down
from
the
summit
of
a
gentle
rise
she
saw
the
smoky
windings
of
the
unbottled
soda
the
doctor
was
a
man
of
action
though
the
policeman
had
made
his
suggestion
only
a
second
before
here
was
the
former
already
leaning
down
to
the
stream
and
having
dipped
was
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
little
company
glass
in
hand
gwendolyn
ran
forward
she
called
have
a
drink
her
father
shook
his
head
i
not
thirsty
he
declared
utterly
ignoring
the
proffered
glass
i
i
was
he
would
sighed
gwendolyn
head
down
again
and
scuffing
bare
feet
in
the
cool
damp
grass
of
the
yet
not
enjoying
it
the
lights
had
changed
the
candles
had
disappeared
filling
the
land
once
more
with
a
golden
glow
were
countless
tapers
electric
gas
and
kerosene
she
was
back
where
she
had
started
threading
the
trees
among
which
she
had
danced
with
joy
but
she
was
far
from
dancing
now
let
not
give
up
hope
said
a
voice
the
doctor
he
was
holding
up
the
glass
before
his
face
to
watch
the
bubbles
creaming
upon
its
surface
there
may
be
a
sudden
turn
for
the
better
before
she
could
draw
another
breath
here
was
the
turn
a
sharp
one
and
she
felt
a
keen
wind
in
her
eyes
blown
in
gusts
as
if
by
the
wings
of
giant
butterflies
the
cloud
that
held
the
wind
lay
just
ahead
a
pinky
mass
that
stretched
from
sky
to
earth
the
bird
turned
his
dark
eyes
upon
gwendolyn
from
where
he
sat
high
and
safe
on
the
doctor
shoulder
i
think
her
little
journey
almost
done
he
said
there
was
a
rich
canary
note
in
his
voice
oo
goody
she
cried
you
mean
you
have
a
solution
asked
the
little
old
gentleman
a
solution
called
back
the
piper
well
a
moment
perfect
stillness
then
it
simple
said
the
bird
now
his
voice
was
strangely
like
the
doctor
i
suppose
you
might
call
it
a
salt
solution
his
last
three
words
began
to
run
through
gwendolyn
mind
a
salt
solution
a
salt
solution
a
salt
solution
as
regularly
as
the
pulse
that
throbbed
in
her
throat
yes
the
doctor
voice
now
breathless
low
tremulous
with
anxiety
if
we
want
to
save
her
am
i
interrupted
gwendolyn
and
again
somebody
sobbed
must
be
done
there
is
anything
to
cry
about
declared
gwendolyn
stoutly
she
felt
hopeful
even
buoyant
it
was
all
novel
and
interesting
the
doctor
began
by
making
grabs
at
the
lump
of
salt
on
the
bird
tail
the
lump
loosened
suddenly
he
caught
it
between
his
palms
after
which
he
began
to
roll
it
precisely
as
he
had
rolled
the
dough
at
the
pillery
and
as
the
salt
worked
into
a
more
perfect
ball
it
slowly
browned
gwendolyn
clapped
her
hands
my
father
wo
know
the
difference
she
cried
you
get
my
idea
exactly
answered
the
bird
the
doctor
uncovered
the
selected
a
fine
round
toasted
example
of
his
own
baking
and
presented
it
to
the
presented
a
second
to
gwendolyn
thence
went
from
one
to
another
of
the
little
company
whereat
everyone
fell
to
eating
at
once
gwendolyn
father
looked
round
the
circle
of
picknickers
as
if
annoyed
by
the
crunching
but
when
the
doctor
held
out
the
brown
salt
he
took
it
examined
it
critically
turning
it
over
and
over
then
lifted
it
and
bit
pretty
slim
lunch
this
he
observed
he
ate
heartily
until
the
last
salt
crumb
was
gone
then
thirsty
he
declared
where
instantly
the
doctor
proffered
the
glass
and
the
other
drank
in
one
great
gasping
mouthful
ah
breathed
gwendolyn
and
felt
a
grateful
coolness
on
her
lips
as
if
she
had
slaked
her
own
thirst
the
next
moment
her
father
turned
and
she
saw
that
the
change
had
already
come
first
of
all
he
looked
down
at
his
hands
caught
sight
of
the
crumpled
bills
and
attempted
to
stuff
them
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
but
his
pockets
were
already
wedged
tight
with
candles
he
reached
round
and
fed
the
bills
into
the
mahogany
case
of
the
next
he
emptied
his
pockets
of
the
candles
frowned
at
them
and
threw
them
to
one
side
to
wilt
last
of
all
he
spied
a
bit
of
leather
strap
and
pulled
at
it
impatiently
whereupon
with
a
clear
ring
of
its
silver
mountings
his
harness
fell
about
his
feet
he
smiled
and
stepped
out
of
it
as
out
of
a
garment
this
quick
movement
shook
up
the
and
at
once
voices
issued
from
the
great
horn
shrilly
protesting
into
his
ear
quack

fille
stupider
honk
honk
and
then
rippling
upward
to
the
accompaniment
of
dancing
feet
a
scale
on
a
piano
he
peered
into
the
horn
when
did
i
come
by
he
demanded
well
i
sha
carry
it
another
step
and
moving
his
shoulders
as
if
they
ached
let
the
slip
sidewise
to
the
glass
there
was
a
crank
attached
to
one
side
of
the
machine
this
he
grasped
and
while
he
continued
to
stuff
bills
into
the
mahogany
box
with
one
hand
he
turned
the
crank
with
the
other
gwendolyn
had
often
marveled
at
the
way
bands
of
music
voices
of
men
and
women
chimes
of
clocks
and
could
come
out
of
the
place
now
this
was
made
clear
to
her
for
as
her
father
whirled
the
crank
out
of
the
horn
in
a
little
procession
waddled
the
creatures
who
had
quacked
so
persistently
there
were
six
of
them
in
all
one
wore
patent
leather
pumps
one
had
a
the
third
was
in
buff
and
blue
another
waddled
with
an
air
unmistakably
french
feathers
formed
a
boa
about
her
neck
the
next
advanced
firmly
a
metronome
swinging
on
a
slender
chain
the
last
one
of
all
carried
a
german
dictionary
her
father
observed
them
gloomily
the
kind
of
ducks
and
drakes
i
been
making
out
of
my
money
he
declared
the
procession
quacked
loudly
as
if
glad
to
get
out
and
waddled
toward
the
stream
why
cried
gwendolyn
there
monsieur

my
and
the
chauffeur
and
my
french
teacher
and
my

his
eyes
rested
upon
her
then
and
she
saw
that
he
knew
her
oh

the
tender
name
she
loved
to
call
him
little
daughter
little
daughter
she
felt
his
arms
about
her
pressing
her
to
him
his
pale
face
was
close
when
my
precious
baby

strong
enough
he
began

right
away

declared

chapter

without
another
moment
delay
gwendolyn
and
her
father
set
forth
traveling
a
road
that
stretched
forward
beside
the
stream
of
soda
winding
as
the
stream
wound
to
the
music
of
the
fuming
water
music
with
a
bass
of
deep
how
sweet
it
all
was
underfoot
the
dirt
was
cool
it
yielded
itself
deliciously
to
gwendolyn
bare
tread
overhead
shading
the
way
were
green
boughs
but
permitting
glimpses
of
blue
upon
this
arbor
bouncing
along
with
an
occasional
chirp
of
contentment
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
assumed
the
lead
went
the
bird
gwendolyn
father
walked
in
silence
his
look
fixed
far
ahead
trotting
at
his
side
she
glanced
up
at
him
now
and
then
she
did
not
have
to
dread
the
coming
of
jane
or
miss
royle
or
thomas
yet
she
felt
concern
on
the
score
of
keeping
beside
him
of
having
ready
a
remark
gay
or
entertaining
should
he
show
signs
of
being
bored
no
sooner
did
the
thought
occur
to
her
than
the
bird
was
ready
with
a
story
he
fluttered
down
to
the
road
hunted
a
small
brush
from
under
his
left
wing
and
scrubbed
carefully
at
the
feathers
covering
his
crop
now
i
can
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
announced
oh
you
going
to
tell
us
how
you
got
the
lump
asked
gwendolyn
eagerly
the
feathers
over
his
crop
were
spotless
he
nodded
and
tucked
away
the
scrubbing
brush
once
upon
a
time
he
began
she
dimpled
with
pleasure
i
like
stories
that
start
that
way
she
interrupted
once
upon
a
time
he
repeated
i
was
just
an
ordinary
sparrow
hopping
about
under
the
of
a
residence
busily
picking
up
crumbs
while
i
was
thus
employed
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
happened
to
spill
some
salt
on
the
floor
being
a
superstitious
creature
she
promptly
threw
a
lump
of
it
over
her
shoulder
well
the
kitchen
window
was
open
and
the
salt
went
through
it
and
lit
on
my
tail
here
he
pointed
his
beak
to
where
the
crystal
had
been
and
no
sooner
did
it
get
firmly
settled
on
my
feathers
the
first
person
that
came
along
could
catch
you
cried
gwendolyn
jane
told
me
jane
said
the
bird
the
fat
woman
that
was
my
nurse
the
bird
ruffled
his
plumage
well
of
course
she
knew
the
facts
he
admitted
you
see
was
the
oh
as
long
as
that
lump
was
on
my
tail
resumed
the
bird
anybody
could
catch
me
and
send
me
anywhere
and
nobody
ever
seemed
to
want
to
take
the
horrid
load
off
with
salt
so
cheap
did
you
do
errands
for
my
her
father
answered
messages
and
messages
and
messages
he
murmured
wearily
there
was
a
rustle
as
of
paper
mostly
financial
he
sighed
sometimes
my
work
has
eased
up
a
trifle
went
on
the
bird
more
cheerily
that
when
they
hired
jack
robinson
because
he
so
quick
oh
yes
you
worked
for
they
said
gwendolyn
please
who
are
they
and
what
do
they
look
like
and
how
many
are
there
of
ahead
was
a
bend
in
the
road
he
pointed
it
out
with
his
bill
you
know
said
he
it
just
as
good
to
turn
a
corner
as
a
stone
for
there
they
are
now
he
gave
an
important
bounce
she
rounded
the
bend
on
tiptoe
but
when
she
caught
sight
of
they
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
seen
them
many
times
before
they
were
two
in
number
and
wore
top
hats
and
coats
with
black
piping
they
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
facing
each
other
about
their
feet
fluttered
dingy
feathers
and
between
them
was
a
crow
which
they
were
picking
once
she
had
wanted
to
thank
they
for
the
pocket
in
the
new
dress
now
she
felt
as
if
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
mention
to
such
stately
personages
so
leaving
her
father
she
advanced
modestly
and
curtsied
how
do
you
do
they
she
began
i
glad
to
meet
you
they
stared
at
her
without
replying
they
were
alike
in
face
as
well
as
in
dress
even
in
their
haughty
expression
of
countenance
i
heard
about
you
so
often
went
on
gwendolyn
i
feel
i
almost
know
you
and
i
heard
lots
of
things
that
you
said
are
you
always
saying
things
saying
things
they
repeated
she
was
astonished
to
find
that
they
spoke
in
chorus
well
it
often
that
does
the
talking
but
we
get
the
blame
now
they
glared
gwendolyn
realizing
that
she
had
been
unfortunate
in
the
choice
of
a
subject
hastened
to
reassure
them
oh
i
do
want
to
blame
you
she
protested
for
things
you
do
do
at
that
they
smiled
i
blame
him
and
he
blames
me
they
answered
in
that
way
we
shift
the
responsibility
at
which
gwendolyn
nodded
understandingly
and
since
we
always
hunt
as
a
couple
here
they
pulled
fiercely
at
the
feathers
of
the
captured
bird
between
them
nobody
ever
knows
who
really
to
blame
they
cast
aside
the
crow
then
and
led
the
way
along
the
road
walking
briskly
behind
them
walked
the
policeman
one
hand
to
his
cap
say
please
do
put
me
off
the
force
he
begged
grass
and
flowers
grew
along
the
center
of
the
road
no
sooner
did
the
policeman
make
his
request
than
they
moved
across
this
tiny
hedge
and
traveled
one
side
of
the
road
giving
the
other
side
over
to
the
officer
whereupon
he
strode
abreast
of
they
swinging
his
thoughtfully
the
walking
was
pleasant
there
by
the
the
fresh
breeze
caressed
gwendolyn
cheeks
and
swirled
her
yellow
hair
about
her
shoulders
she
took
deep
breaths
through
nostrils
swelled
to
their
widest
oh
i
like
this
place
best
in
the
whole
whole
world
she
said
earnestly
the
next
moment
she
knew
why
for
rounding
another
bend
she
caught
sight
of
a
small
boyish
figure
in
a
plaid
gingham
waist
and
jeans
overalls
his
tousled
head
was
raised
eagerly
his
blue
eyes
shone
he
called
she
gave
a
leap
forward
why
it
johnnie
blake
she
cried
johnnie
oh
johnnie
it
was
johnnie
there
was
no
mistaking
that
small
freckled
nose
say
do
you
want
to
help
dig
worms
he
invited
and
proffered
his
she
needed
no
urging
but
began
to
dig
at
once
and
found
bait
in
abundance
so
that
the
cup
was
quickly
filled
and
she
was
compelled
to
use
his
ragged
straw
hat
oh
is
this
nice
she
exclaimed
and
after
we
fish
let
hunt
a
frog
i
know
where
there
tadpoles
boasted
he
and
bugs
that
can
walk
on
the
water
and
oh
i
want
to
stay
here
always
she
had
forgotten
that
there
were
others
about
but
now
a
voice
her
father
broke
in
upon
her
happy
chatter
without
your
she
had
been
sitting
down
she
rose
and
brushed
her
hands
on
the
skirt
of
her
dress
i
find
my
she
said
the
little
old
gentleman
was
beside
johnnie
patting
his
shoulder
and
thrusting
something
into
a
riveted
pocket
there
he
and
tell
your
father
to
be
sure
to
keep
this
nose
away
from
the
grindstone
gwendolyn
wrinkled
her
brows
but
but
is
johnnie
coming
with
she
asked
at
that
johnnie
shook
his
head
vigorously
not
away
from
he
declared
no
no
repeated
puffy
not
away
from
the
woods
and
the
stream
and
fishing
and
hunting
frogs
and
tadpoles
and
why
he
the
rich
little
poor
boy
oh
well
then
i
come
back
she
moved
away
slowly
looking
over
a
shoulder
at
him
as
she
went
do
forget
i
come
back
i
be
here
he
answered
and
i
let
you
use
my
willow
fishpole
he
waved
a
hand
there
were
along
the
stream
now
alternating
with
these
were
automobile
lights
brass
and
larger
brass
all
like
great
glowing
eyes
again
they
were
in
advance
we
ca
be
very
far
from
the
barn
they
announced
and
each
waved
his
right
arm
in
a
robin
hood
barn
whispered
gwendolyn
the
policeman
nodded
the
first
people
to
go
around
it
said
he
were
ladies
who
used
on
the
parlor
furniture
i
it
been
built
a
long
time
said
gwendolyn
ah
a
time
her
father
was
speaking
now
he
halted
and
pointed
down
to
a
wide
road
that
crossed
the
one
she
was
traveling
just
notice
how
been
worn
the
wide
road
had
deep
ruts
also
here
and
there
upon
it
were
great
holes
but
a
level
strip
between
the
ruts
and
the
holes
shone
as
if
it
had
been
tramped
down
by
countless
feet
around
robin
hood
barn
went
on
her
father
sadly
how
many
have
helped
to
wear
that
road
not
only
her
mother
but
mother
before
her
and
then
back
and
back
as
far
as
you
can
count
i
ca
count
back
very
far
said
gwendolyn
i
never
have
any
time
for
i
have
to
study
my
french
and
my
german
and
my
music
and
my
her
father
groaned
i
traveled
it
too
he
admitted
she
lifted
her
eyes
then
and
there
just
across
that
wide
road
was
the
barn
looming
up
darkly
a
great
framework
of
steel
girders
all
bolted
together
and
rusted
in
patches
and
streaks
through
these
girders
could
be
seen
small
regular
spots
of
light
nobody
to
go
round
the
barn
she
protested
anybody
could
just
go
right
in
at
one
side
and
right
out
at
the
other
but
the
said
her
father
meaningly
if
ever
one
feet
touch
it
she
thought
the
road
wonderful
it
was
and
full
of
gentle
undulations
where
it
was
smoothest
it
reflected
the
barn
and
all
the
surrounding
lights
yet
now
like
the
shining
tin
of
a
it
resounded
to
a
some
one
coming
announced
the
piper
it
was
a
low
angry
droning
the
next
moment
a
figure
came
into
sight
at
a
corner
of
the
barn
it
was
a
slender
girlish
figure
and
it
came
hurrying
forward
along
the
circular
way
with
never
a
glance
to
right
or
left
gwendolyn
could
see
that
whoever
the
traveler
was
her
dress
was
plain
and
scant
nor
were
there
ornaments
shining
in
her
pretty
hair
which
was
unbound
she
was
shod
in
dainty
slippers
and
now
she
walked
as
fast
as
she
could
again
she
broke
into
a
run
but
taking
no
note
of
the
ruts
and
rough
places
continually
stumbled
she
watching
what
in
her
hand
said
the
contemplation
speculation
perlustration
and
he
sighed
she
have
a
fine
account
to
settle
with
me
this
the
piper
again
he
whipped
out
his
that
what
call
a
merry
dance
see
what
she
carrying
advised
the
bird
in
one
hand
the
figure
held
a
small
dark
something
gwendolyn
looked
why
why
she
began
hesitatingly
is
it
a
a
bonnet
it
was
a
plain
piece
of
millinery
the
drone
grew
loud
the
figure
caught
the
bonnet
close
to
her
face
and
held
it
there
turning
it
about
anxiously
her
eyes
were
eager
her
lips
wore
a
proud
smile
it
was
then
that
gwendolyn
recognized
her
and
leaned
forward
holding
out
her
arms
she
plead
her
mother
did
not
hear
or
if
she
heard
did
not
so
much
as
lift
her
eyes
from
the
bonnet
she
tripped
regained
her
balance
and
rushed
past
hair
dress
fluttering
at
either
side
of
her
smoke
curled
away
like
silk
veiling
blown
out
by
the
swift
pace
oh
she
burning
cried
gwendolyn
in
a
panic
of
sudden
distress
the
doctor
bent
down
that
money
he
explained
burning
her
pockets
she
ca
see
anything
but
the
bee
she
ca
hear
anything
but
the
bee
it
was
gwendolyn
father
murmuring
to
himself
bee
now
the
bird
came
bouncing
to
gwendolyn
side
you
read
that
bees
are
busy
little
things
have
you
he
asked
well
this
particular
that
the
very
one
she
declared
is
no
exception
we
must
get
it
away
from
her
declared
gwendolyn
oh
how
her
poor
feet
must
be
as
she
said
it
she
was
conscious
of
the
burning
ache
of
her
own
feet
and
yet
the
tears
that
swam
in
her
eyes
were
tears
of
sympathy
not
of
pain
puffy
wo
you
eat
it
puffy
blinked
as
if
embarrassed
well
you
see
a
bee
er
makes
honey
he
began
lamely
the
figure
had
turned
a
corner
of
the
barn
now
on
the
farther
side
of
the
great
structure
it
was
flitting
past
the
openings
gwendolyn
rested
a
hand
on
the
wing
of
the
bird
wo
eat
it
she
questioned
the
bird
wagged
his
bumpy
head
it
against
all
the
laws
of
this
land
he
declared
but
this
is
a
bee
a
bird
is
even
allowed
to
eat
a
bad
bee
but
chirping
low
tell
you
what
be
tried
yes
your
mother
to
trade
her
bonnet
for
the
piper
gwendolyn
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
she
understood
the
prettier
she
declared
oh
if
she
only
would
piper
the
piper
swaggered
up
some
collecting
on
hand
he
asked
swinging
as
usual
from
a
shoulder
was
the
poke
gwendolyn
thought
she
had
never
seen
a
prettier
one
its
ribbon
bows
were
fresh
and
smart
its
lace
was
and
neatly
frilled
oh
i
she
make
the
trade
she
exclaimed
happily
the
piper
considered
the
matter
pursing
his
lips
around
the
in
his
mouth
standing
on
one
foot
gwendolyn
appealed
to
the
maybe
have
to
have
her
ears
sharpened
she
suggested
the
little
old
gentleman
shook
his
shaggy
head
let
her
hear
that
pig
he
warned
darkly
she
come
round
in
another
moment
it
was
the
doctor
voice
very
cheery
at
that
the
piper
unslung
the
poke
and
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
road
i
never
wanted
this
crazy
poke
he
asserted
over
a
shoulder
to
gwendolyn
now
i
just
get
rid
of
it
and
i
present
that
bonnet
with
the
bee
here
he
laughed
harshly
to
a
woman
that
footed
a
single
one
of
my
bills
ha
ha
again
that
high
strident
note
gwendolyn
mother
was
circling
into
sight
once
more
fortunately
she
was
keeping
close
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
road
the
piper
faced
in
the
direction
she
was
speeding
and
prepared
to
race
beside
her
it
was
an
exciting
moment
she
was
holding
out
the
bonnet
as
before
he
thrust
the
poke
between
her
face
and
it
carefully
keeping
the
lace
and
the
bows
in
front
of
her
very
eyes
madam
he
shouted
trade
her
mother
heard
her
look
fell
upon
the
poke
she
slowed
to
a
walk
shouted
the
piper
again
dangling
the
poke
temptingly
she
stopped
short
gazing
hard
at
the
poke
trade
she
repeated
coldly
her
voice
sounded
as
if
from
a
great
distance
trade
well
that
depends
upon
what
they
say
then
she
circled
on
at
such
a
terrible
rate
that
the
piper
could
not
keep
pace
he
ceased
running
and
fell
behind
breathing
hard
and
complaining
oh
oh
mourned
gwendolyn
the
smoke
blown
back
from
that
fleeing
figure
smarted
her
throat
and
eyes
she
raised
an
arm
to
shield
her
face
disappointed
and
feeling
a
first
touch
of
weariness
she
could
not
choke
back
a
great
sob
that
shook
her
convulsively
the
whiskers
buried
in
his
ragged
collar
was
nodding
thoughtfully
by
and
by
he
murmured
by
and
by
presently
later
on
the
doctor
was
even
more
comforting
there
there
he
said
cry
but
oh
breathed
gwendolyn
her
bosom
heaving
why
do
you
feel
pulse
it
it
terrible
faltered
gwendolyn
father
his
agonized
look
was
fixed
upon
the
road
now
the
road
was
indeed
terrible
for
there
were
great
chasms
in
it
chasms
that
yawned
darkly
that
opened
and
closed
as
if
by
the
rush
and
receding
of
water
gwendolyn
mother
crossed
them
in
flitting
leaps
as
from
one
to
another
her
daintily
shod
feet
scarcely
touched
the
road
so
swift
was
her
going
a
second
and
she
was
whipped
from
sight
at
the
barn
corner
about
her
slender
figure
as
it
disappeared
dust
mingled
with
the
smoke
mingled
and
swirled
in
shape
with
a
wide
base
and
a
narrow
top
like
the
picture
of
a
in
the
back
of
gwendolyn
geography
the
piper
came
back
wiping
his
forehead
what
does
she
care
about
a
poke
he
scolded
flinging
himself
down
irritably
huh
all
she
thinks
about
is
what
they
say
at
that
gwendolyn
spirits
revived
somehow
instantly
and
clearly
she
knew
what
should
be
done
but
when
she
opened
her
mouth
she
found
that
she
could
not
speak
her
lips
were
dry
her
tongue
would
not
move
she
could
only
swallow
then
just
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
herself
down
and
giving
way
utterly
to
tears
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
hand
a
furry
touch
next
something
was
slipped
into
her
grasp
it
was
the
well
piper
she
cried
out
what
they
say
they
were
close
by
standing
side
by
side
gazing
at
nothing
for
their
eyes
were
wide
open
their
faces
gwendolyn
father
addressed
them
i
never
asked
my
wife
to
drop
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
gravely
for
gwendolyn
sake
might
i
suppose
one
hand
was
in
his
pocket
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
blinked
once
the
two
mouths
spoke
in
unison
money
talks
gwendolyn
father
drew
his
hand
from
his
pocket
it
was
filled
with
bills
will
these
he
began
it
was
the
piper
who
snatched
the
money
out
of
his
hand
and
handed
it
to
they
and
thinking
it
over
afterward
gwendolyn
felt
deep
gratitude
for
the
promptness
with
which
they
acted
for
having
received
the
money
they
advanced
into
that
terrible
road
faced
and
halted
the
angry
song
of
the
bee
was
faint
then
for
the
slender
figure
was
speeding
past
those
patches
of
light
that
could
be
seen
through
the
girders
of
the
barn
but
soon
the
buzzing
grew
louder
as
mother
came
into
sight
shrouded
and
scarcely
discernible
they
met
her
as
she
came
on
blocking
her
way
and
madam
they
shouted
trade
your
bonnet
for
the
piper
poke
gwendolyn
held
her
breath
her
mother
halted
now
for
the
first
time
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
about
as
if
dazed
and
miserable
there
was
a
flush
on
each
smooth
cheek
she
was
panting
so
that
her
lips
quivered
the
piper
rose
and
hurried
forward
and
seeing
him
she
reached
out
a
hand
a
slender
white
hand
quickly
he
relinquished
the
poke
but
when
she
took
it
made
a
cup
of
his
two
hands
under
it
as
if
he
feared
she
might
let
it
fall
the
poke
was
heavier
than
the
bonnet
she
held
it
low
but
looked
at
it
intently
smiling
a
little
presently
without
even
a
parting
glance
she
held
the
bonnet
out
to
him
take
it
away
she
commanded
it
is
becoming
he
received
it
and
promptly
made
off
along
the
road
the
bonnet
held
up
before
his
face
when
it
comes
to
chargin
he
called
back
with
an
independent
jerk
of
the
head
i
the
only
chap
that
can
keep
ahead
of
a
chauffeur
and
he
laughed
uproariously
gwendolyn
mother
now
began
to
admire
the
poke
turning
it
around
at
the
same
time
tilting
her
head
to
one
side
this
very
like
the
bird
she
fingered
the
lace
and
picked
at
the
ribbon
then
having
viewed
it
from
every
angle
she
opened
it
as
if
to
put
it
on
there
was
a
bounce
and
a
piercing
squeal
then
over
the
rim
of
the
poke
with
a
thump
as
it
hit
the
roadway
shot
a
small
pig
she
dropped
the
poke
and
sprang
back
frightened
and
as
the
porker
cut
away
among
the
trees
she
wheeled
caught
sight
of
gwendolyn
and
suddenly
opened
her
arms
with
a
cry
gwendolyn
flung
herself
forward
no
need
now
to
fear
harming
an
elegant
dress
or
roughing
carefully
arranged
hair
she
clasped
her
mother
neck
pressing
a
wet
cheek
against
a
cheek
of
satin
oh
my
baby
my
baby
look
at
mother
i
looking
at
you
answered
gwendolyn
half
sobbing
and
half
laughing
i
looked
at
you
for
a
time
i
you
so
i
love
you
the
next
moment
the
dashed
suddenly
aside
to
a
nearby
square
of
packed
ground
over
which
blazing
with
lights
hung
one
huge
tree
under
the
tree
was
a
high
broad
a
squat
stool
and
two
tables
the
little
old
gentleman
began
to
bang
his
furniture
about
excitedly
the
tables
are
turned
he
shouted
the
tables
are
turned
of
course
the
tables
are
turned
said
gwendolyn
but
what
make
difference
he
repeated
tearing
back
it
means
that
from
now
on
everything
going
to
be
exactly
to
what
it
has
been
oo
goody
then
lifting
a
puzzled
face
but
why
did
you
turn
the
tables
at
first
and
why
did
we
stay
here
my
was
here
all
the
time
and
the
regarded
her
solemnly
suppose
we
had
gone
around
he
said
just
suppose
before
her
in
a
line
were
they
the
doctor
the
policeman
puffy
and
the
bird
he
indicated
them
by
a
nod
she
nodded
too
comprehending
but
now
went
on
the
little
old
gentleman
we
must
all
absquatulate
he
took
her
hand
oh
must
you
she
asked
regretfully
absquatulate
was
a
big
word
but
she
understood
it
having
come
across
it
one
day
in
the
dictionary
he
leaned
down
and
she
saw
that
his
round
black
eyes
were
clouded
while
his
square
brows
were
working
with
the
effort
of
keeping
back
his
tears
he
stepped
back
out
of
the
waiting
line
turned
and
made
off
slowly
turning
the
crank
of
the
as
he
went
now
the
voices
of
they
spoke
up
we
also
bid
you
they
said
politely
we
shall
have
to
go
people
must
hear
about
this
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
wheeled
and
followed
the
little
old
gentleman
but
my
puffy
said
gwendolyn
i
like
to
keep
him
i
do
care
if
he
is
shabby
for
answer
there
was
a
crackling
and
crashing
in
the
underbrush
as
if
some
animal
were
lumbering
away
i
think
explained
her
father
that
he
gone
to
make
some
poor
little
boy
very
happy
oh
the
rich
little
poor
boy
i
guess
said
gwendolyn
contented
the
bird
was
just
in
front
of
her
he
looked
very
handsome
and
bright
as
he
flirted
his
rudder
saucily
and
darted
now
up
now
down
presently
he
began
to
sing
a
glad
clear
song
and
singing
rose
into
the
air
oh
she
breathed
he
happy
he
got
that
salt
off
his
tail
when
she
looked
again
at
the
line
the
policeman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
doctor
yes
do
go
the
doctor
is
right
here
said
her
mother
soothingly
gwendolyn
smiled
and
put
one
hand
in
the
clasp
of
her
mother
the
other
in
a
bigger
grasp
tired
out
all
tired
out
murmured
her
father
she
was
sleepy
too
almost
past
the
keeping
open
of
her
gray
eyes
long
as
you
both
are
with
me
she
whispered
i
would
mind
if
i
was
back
in
the
nursery
the
glow
that
filled
the
land
now
seemed
suddenly
to
soften
the
clustered
tapers
had
lessened
to
a
single
chandelier
of
four
globes
next
the
forest
trees
began
to
flatten
and
take
on
the
appearance
of
a
conventional
pattern
the
grass
became
in
smoothness
the
sky
squared
itself
to
the
proportions
of
a
ceiling
there
was
no
mistaking
the
change
at
hand
we
getting
close
she
announced
happily
the
light
was
dim
peaceful
here
and
there
through
it
she
caught
glints
of
white
and
gold
then
familiar
objects
took
shape
she
made
out
the
flanking
it
her
upon
which
were
the
two
portraits
and
there
between
the
portraits
was
the
calendar
with
checking
off
each
figure
in
the
lines
that
led
up
to
her
birthday
she
sighed
a
deep
tremulous
sigh
of
content
chapter
xvi
she
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
slowly
and
felt
the
cool
touch
of
the
pillow
against
either
cheek
then
she
tried
to
lift
her
arms
but
found
that
one
hand
was
still
in
a
big
grasp
the
other
in
a
clasp
that
was
softer
little
by
little
and
with
effort
she
opened
her
gray
eyes
in
the
dimness
she
could
see
to
her
left
scarcely
more
than
an
outline
of
a
figure
stooped
and
watchful
of
that
other
slender
figure
opposite
after
all
the
fatigue
and
worry
of
the
night
her
father
and
mother
were
with
her
yet
and
someone
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
leaning
and
looking
down
at
her
that
was
the
doctor
she
lay
very
still
this
was
a
novel
experience
this
having
both
father
and
mother
in
the
nursery
at
the
same
time
and
plainly
in
no
haste
to
depart
the
heaviness
of
deep
sleep
was
gradually
leaving
her
yet
she
forbore
to
speak
and
as
each
moment
went
she
dreaded
the
passing
of
it
lest
her
wonderful
new
happiness
come
to
an
end
presently
she
ventured
a
look
around
at
the
ceiling
with
its
cluster
of
plaster
roses
out
of
which
branched
the
chandelier
at
the
walls
of
soft
rose
met
here
and
there
by
the
deeper
rose
of
the
brocade
hangings
at
the
plushy
rug
the
piano
the
large
table
now
scattered
with
an
unusual
assortment
of
bottles
and
glasses
at
the
dresser
and
strewn
daintily
the
deep
upholstered
chair
and
the
long
cushioned
seat
across
the
front
window
over
which
strangely
enough
no
cage
was
swinging
and
there
was
the
tall
the
shelves
of
it
were
unchanged
on
that
one
below
the
line
of
prettily
clad
dolls
were
the
toys
she
favored
most
the
top
the
handsome
soldier
in
the
scarlet
coat
the
jointed
snake
beside
its
box
and
the
somersault
man
poised
heels
over
head
beyond
these
ranged
in
a
buff
row
were
the
six
small
ducks
acquired
at
easter
she
gave
each
plaything
a
keen
glance
they
reminded
her
vividly
of
the
long
busy
night
just
past
her
small
nose
wrinkled
in
a
quizzical
smile
at
that
the
three
waiting
figures
stirred
her
look
came
back
to
them
to
rest
first
upon
her
father
face
noting
how
long
and
pale
and
haggard
it
was
how
sunken
the
temples
how
bloodless
the
tightly
pressed
lips
how
hollow
the
unshaven
cheeks
when
she
turned
to
gaze
at
her
mother
as
daintily
clad
as
ever
and
as
delicately
perfumed
showing
no
evidence
of
dusty
travel
she
saw
how
pitifully
pale
was
that
dear
beautiful
face
but
the
eyes
were
no
longer
proud
only
anxious
tender
and
next
gwendolyn
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
doctor
and
felt
suddenly
remembering
how
she
had
always
dreaded
him
had
taken
the
mere
thought
of
his
coming
as
punishment
remembering
too
how
helpful
and
kind
he
had
been
to
her
through
the
night
he
began
to
speak
low
and
earnestly
and
as
if
continuing
something
already
half
said
pardon
my
bluntness
but
it
a
bad
thing
when
there
too
much
money
spent
on
forcing
the
brain
before
the
body
is
given
a
chance
or
the
soul
does
a
child
get
food
that
is
simple
and
nourishing
and
enough
of
it
is
all
exercise
taken
in
the
open
too
often
i
find
where
a
motor
at
the
beck
and
call
of
a
nurse
the
child
in
her
charge
is
utterly
cut
off
and
in
the
period
of
quickest
growth
from
a
normal
supply
of
plain
walking
every
boy
and
girl
has
a
right
his
voice
deepened
with
feeling
to
the
great
world
out
of
doors
let
the
warm
sun
and
the
fresh
air
and
god
good
earth
gwendolyn
moved
is
is
he
praying
she
whispered
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
no
daughter
answered
her
father
while
her
mother
leaned
to
lay
a
gentle
hand
on
her
forehead
the
doctor
went
aside
to
the
larger
table
and
busied
himself
with
some
bottles
when
he
came
back
her
father
lifted
her
head
a
trifle
by
lifting
the
pillow
her
mother
rising
quickly
to
assist
and
the
doctor
put
a
glass
to
gwendolyn
lips
she
drank
dutifully
and
was
lowered
at
once
she
felt
stronger
is
the
sun
up
she
asked
her
voice
was
weak
and
somewhat
hoarse
would
you
like
to
see
the
sky
asked
her
father
and
without
waiting
for
her
eager
nod
crossed
to
the
front
window
and
drew
aside
the
heavy
silk
hangings
serenely
blue
was
the
long
rectangle
framed
by
curtains
and
casing
across
it
not
a
single
fat
sheep
was
straying
yes
darling
is
is
always
the
same
piece
of
heaven
right
there
through
the
window
no
the
earth
is
turning
all
the
time
just
as
your
globe
in
the
turns
and
so
each
moment
you
see
a
new
square
of
sky
the
doctor
nodded
with
satisfaction
um
better
are
we
he
inquired
smiling
down
she
returned
the
smile
well
am
she
declared
but
i
know
you
felt
bad
he
laughed
tell
me
something
he
went
on
i
sent
a
bottle
of
medicine
here
yesterday
yes
it
was
a
little
bottle
how
much
of
it
did
jane
give
you
can
you
remember
well
first
she
poured
out
one
teaspoonful
the
doctor
had
been
leaning
again
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
now
he
fell
back
of
a
sudden
a
he
gasped
and
to
gwendolyn
father
why
that
wretched
girl
did
read
the
directions
on
the
bottle
there
was
another
silence
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
but
gwendolyn
mother
her
face
paler
than
before
bent
above
the
yellow
head
on
the
pillow
after
i
drank
teaspoonful
went
on
gwendolyn
jane
believe
me
and
so
she
made
me
take
the
other
it
was
the
doctor
once
more
he
pressed
a
trembling
hand
to
his
forehead
her
father
rose
angrily
she
shall
be
punished
he
declared
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
i
wo
let
this
pass
gwendolyn
look
followed
him
tenderly
well
you
see
she
did
know
about
about
nursery
work
she
explained
before
she
came
here
she
was
just
a
cook
oh
my
baby
daughter
murmured
gwendolyn
mother
brokenly
she
bent
forward
until
her
face
was
hidden
against
the
silken
cover
of
the
bed
mother
did
know
you
were
being
neglected
she
thought
she
was
giving
you
the
of
care
dear
two
spoonfuls
said
the
doctor
grimly
that
explains
everything
oh
but
i
did
want
to
take
the
last
one
protested
gwendolyn
hastily
though
it
tasted
good
she
made
me
she
said
if
i
did
so
exclaimed
the
doctor
interrupting
she
frightened
the
poor
little
helpless
thing
in
order
to
get
obedience
gwendolyn
whispered
her
mother
she
you
the
gray
eyes
smiled
wisely
it
does
matter
now
she
said
a
hint
of
triumph
in
her
voice
i
found
out
that
are
nice
and
so
are
are
doctors
she
dimpled
and
nodded
and
all
the
bears
in
the
world
that
are
outside
of
cages
are
just
puffy
bears
grown
up
then
uncertainly
but
i
did
find
out
about
the
other
what
other
asked
her
father
pausing
in
his
walk
the
gray
eyes
were
now
though
i
do
believe
it
she
hastened
to
add
but
wicked
men
keep
watch
of
this
house
men
her
mother
suddenly
straightened
kidnapers
this
innocent
statement
had
an
unexpected
effect
again
her
father
began
to
stride
up
and
down
angrily
while
her
mother
head
drooping
once
more
began
to
weep
oh
mother
did
know
she
sobbed
mother
did
guess
what
terrible
things
were
happening
oh
forgive
her
forgive
her
the
doctor
came
to
her
side
too
much
excitement
for
the
patient
he
reminded
her
do
you
think
you
better
go
and
lie
down
for
a
while
and
have
a
little
rest
a
startled
look
and
gwendolyn
put
out
a
staying
hand
to
her
mother
then
tired
she
assented
she
tireder
than
i
am
it
was
hard
work
going
round
and
round
robin
hood
barn
the
doctor
hunted
a
small
wrist
and
felt
the
pulse
in
it
that
all
right
he
said
to
her
mother
in
an
undertone
everything
still
pretty
real
to
her
you
see
but
her
pulse
is
normal
he
laid
cool
fingers
across
her
forehead
temperature
almost
normal
too
gwendolyn
felt
that
she
had
not
made
herself
altogether
clear
she
hastened
to
explain
i
mean
she
said
when
was
carrying
that
society
bee
in
her
bonnet
confusion
showed
in
the
doctor
quick
glance
from
parent
to
parent
then
i
think
i
just
drop
down
into
the
pantry
he
said
hastily
and
see
how
that
young
nurse
from
over
yonder
is
getting
along
he
jerked
a
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
side
window
as
he
went
out
gwendolyn
wondered
just
who
the
young
nurse
was
she
opened
her
lips
to
ask
then
saw
how
painfully
her
mother
had
colored
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
person
in
question
and
so
kept
silence
the
doctor
gone
her
father
came
to
her
mother
side
and
patted
a
shoulder
well
we
sha
ever
say
anything
more
about
that
bee
he
declared
laughing
yet
serious
enough
we
gwendolyn
no
she
blinked
puzzling
over
it
a
little
there
it
settled
he
bent
and
kissed
his
wife
you
thought
you
were
doing
the
best
thing
for
our
little
girl
know
that
dear
you
had
her
future
in
mind
and
it
natural
and
for
a
mother
to
think
of
making
friends
the
right
kind
too
and
a
place
in
the
social
world
for
her
daughter
and
i
been
and
neglectful
and
ah
she
raised
wet
eyes
to
him
you
had
your
worries
you
were
doing
than
your
share
you
had
to
meet
the
question
of
money
while
i
he
interrupted
her
we
thought
we
were
doing
our
very
best
he
declared
we
almost
did
our
worst
oh
what
would
it
all
have
amounted
to
what
would
have
mattered
if
we
lost
our
little
girl
the
pink
came
rushing
to
gwendolyn
cheeks
why
i
was
lost
at
all
she
declared
happily
and
oh
it
was
so
good
to
have
my
questions
all
answered
and
understand
so
many
things
i
did
once
and
to
be
where
all
the
lights
go
and
and
where
comes
from
and
i
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
thomas
and
jane
and
miss
royle
and
the
opened
she
checked
herself
to
look
that
way
someone
was
entering
with
a
tray
it
was
a
maid
maid
wearing
a
gwendolyn
knew
her
instantly
that
pretty
face
as
full
and
rosy
as
the
face
of
the
french
doll
and
framed
by
saucy
wisps
and
curls
as
fair
as
gwendolyn
own
and
freckleless
oh
it
was
a
low
cry
of
delight
the
nurse
smiled
she
had
a
tray
in
one
hand
on
the
tray
was
a
blue
bowl
of
something
steaming
hot
she
set
the
tray
down
and
came
to
the
gwendolyn
eyes
were
wide
with
wonder
how
how
she
began
her
mother
answered
jane
called
down
to
the
policeman
and
he
ran
to
the
house
on
the
corner
now
the
dimples
sprang
into
place
goody
exclaimed
gwendolyn
and
gave
a
little
chuckle
her
mother
went
on
we
never
can
feel
grateful
enough
to
her
because
she
was
such
a
help
and
we
so
glad
you
friends
already
gwendolyn
nodded
she
one
of
my
she
explained

the
nurse
she
smoothed
hair
fondly

you
like
that
it
fine
i
i
wanted
you
the
doctor
well
how
does
our
sharp
little
patient
feel
now
he
inquired

hungry

have
some
broth
for
you
announced
the
pretty
nurse
and
brought
forward
the
tray
gwendolyn
looked
down
at
the
bowl
she
breathed
it
smells
good
now
to
the
doctor
if
i
had
one
of
your
nice
at
that
curiously
enough
everyone
laughed
the
doctor
heartiest
of
all
and
hush
chided
her
mother
gently
while
the
doctor
shook
a
teasing
finger
just
for
that
said
he
we
have
eating
and
conversation
for
five
whole
minutes
whereupon
he
began
to
scribble
on
a
pad
laughing
to
himself
every
now
and
then
as
he
wrote
that
must
be
a
cheerful
prescription
observed
gwendolyn
father
he
himself
looking
happier
than
he
had
the
country
answered
the
doctor
is
always
cheerful
gwendolyn
spoon
slipped
from
her
fingers
she
lifted
eager
shining
eyes
she
does
the
doctor
mean
blake
the
doctor
assented
energetically
i
johnnie
blake
he
declared
it
was
a
deep
breath
of
happiness
i
johnnie
that
i
come
back
but
if
my
little
daughter
is
strong
her
father
gave
a
sidewise
glance
at
the
steaming
bowl
on
the
tray
thus
prompted
gwendolyn
fell
to
eating
once
more
turning
her
attention
to
the
bobbing
about
on
the
broth
each
was
square
and
crunchy
but
not
so
brown
as
a
i
shall
now
read
my
johnnie
blake
prescription
announced
the
doctor
and
held
up
a
leaf
from
the
pad
hm
hm
then
in
a
tone
two
pairs
of
sandals
a
dozen
cheap
gingham
dresses
with
plenty
of
pockets
and
extra
pieces
for
patches
and
a
bottle
of
something
good
for
wild
he
bowed
all
together
with
one
strong
oh
cried
gwendolyn
her
hoarse
voice
wistful
with
pleading
wo
mind
if
i
play
with
johnnie

the
time
answered
her
father
play
hard
and
then
play
some
more
he
a
common
little
boy
whereupon
satisfied
she
returned
to
the
blue
bowl
and
now
went
on
the
doctor
as
to
directions
he
held
up
other
leaves
from
the
pad
first
week
you
have
to
go
easy
the
first
week
use
the
prescription
each
day
as
follows
when
driving
also
when
lying
on
back
watching
birds
in
trees
and
have
a
nap
out
of
doors
if
you
feel
like
it
also
when
lighting
the
fire
at
sundown
nurse
here
will
watch
out
for
fingers
at
that
another
pleased
little
chuckle
second
week
the
doctor
coughed
importantly
when
riding
your
own
fat
pony
or
chasing
butterflies
assisted
by
one
common
ordinary
dog
or
when
fishing
stream
or
it
does
matter
or
carrying
kindling
in
to
cook
whether
you
tired
or
not
i
it
third

mudpies
or

tomboy
yelling
and

barefoot
gwendolyn
spoon
wabbled
in

she
repeated
small
face
flushing
to
a
pleased
pink
right
before
i
eight
um
assented
the
doctor
and
shin
up
trees
but
do
disturb
eggs
if
you
find
also
do
barefoot
gardening
where
there
is
a
plant
to
hurt
wade
the
again
the
dimples
came
rushing
to
their
places
i
like
squashing
she
declared
smiling
round
then
is
there
a
hill
to
climb
continued
the
doctor
with
your
hat
down
your
back
on
a
string
and
stones
to
roll
the
small
face
grew
suddenly
serious
no
thank
you
she
said
with
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
i
rather
not
turn
any
stones
very
well
hm
hm
oh
and
there
be
jolly
times
of
an
evening
after
supper
broke
in
her
father
enthusiastically
the
stern
lines
of
his
face
were
relaxed
and
a
score
of
tiny
ripples
were
carrying
a
smile
from
his
mouth
to
his
tired
eyes
we
light
all
the
candles
daddy
she
relinquished
the
bowl
and
turned
to
him
swiftly
not
not
candles
that
burn
at
both
ends
no
he
stopped
smiling
you
a
wise
little
body
pronounced
the
doctor
taking
her
hand
how
the
pulse
now
asked
her
mother
somehow
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
she
makes
me
anxious
normal
answered
the
doctor
promptly
only
thing
that
is
normal
about
her
is
that
busy
brain
which
is
abnormally
bright
thereupon
he
shook
the
small
hand
he
was
holding
strode
to
the
table
and
picked
up
a
case
it
was
black
and
held
a
number
of
bottles
in
no
way
did
it
resemble
the
and
if
a
certain
person
is
to
leave
for
the
country
soon
gwendolyn
smile
was
knowing
you
mean
certain
party
he
was
trying
to
tease
her
with
that
old
nursery
name
she
better
rest
and
with
that
mild
advice
he
beckoned
the
nurse
to
follow
him
whispered
with
her
a
moment
at
the
door
and
was
gone
gwendolyn
father
resumed
his
place
beside
the
bed
she
rest
he
declared
the
blessed
baby

governess
or
a
teacher

to
show
as
much
as
a
she
nodded
we
do
want
quacking
around
someone
tapped
at
the
door
then
and
entered
rosa
bearing
a
upon
which
were
two
square
bits
of
pasteboard
to
see
madam
she
said
presenting
the
tray
after
which
she
showed
her
white
teeth
in
greeting
to
gwendolyn
then
stooped
and
touched
an
open
palm
with
her
lips
gwendolyn
mother
read
the
cards
and
shook
her
head

moment

gwendolyn

policy

good
deal
yes
oh
yes
he
went
to
the
front
window
and
as
he
stood
in
the
light
gwendolyn
lay
and
looked
at
him
he
had
worn
green
the
night
before
but
now
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
paper
money
showing
anywhere
in
his
dress
in
fact
he
was
wearing
the
suit
a
dark
blue
he
had
worn
that
night
she
penetrated
to
the
library
well
little
daughter
i
was
wondering
has
anybody
scribbled
on
the
general
horse
with
chalk
her
father
looked
down
at
the
drive
the
general
there
he
announced
glancing
back
at
her
over
a
shoulder
and
his
horse
seems
in
fettle
this
morning
prancing
and
arching
his
neck
and
scribbled
on
him
which
seems
to
please
the
general
very
much
for
got
his
hat
off
gwendolyn
sat
up
her
eyes
rounding
to
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
soldiers
she
told
her
mother
only
everybody
ca
see
the
soldiers
her
father
came
back
to
her
can
he
declared
proudly
do
you
want
to
see
too
just
a
glimpse
mother
come
we
play
the
game
together
and
the
next
moment
silk
coverlet
and
all
gwendolyn
was
swung
up
in
his
arms
and
borne
to
the
and
oh
there
the
she
cried
out
his
name
is
flynn
informed
her
father
and
this
morning
asked
after
you
oh
she
stood
up
among
the
cushions
to
get
a
better
view
he
takes
lost
little
boys
and
girls
to
their
and
daddy
and
he
takes
care
of
the
trees
and
the
flowers
and
the
fountains
and
and
the
but
he
only
likes
it
up
here
in
summer
in
winter
he
likes
to
be
and
he
to
be
he
got
a
level
head
wave
to
him
now
said
her
father
there
he
swinging
his
cap
when
we
out
walking
one
of
these
times
we
stop
and
shake
hands
with
him
with
the
man
too
oh
you
like
him
you
and
you
wo
send
him
away
father
wo
he
laid
her
back
among
the
pillows
then
and
she
turned
her
face
to
her
mother
ca
you
sleep
darling
and
do
dream
well
i
pretty
tired
we
know
what
a
hard
long
night
it
was
oh
i
glad
we
going
back
to
johnnie
blake
oh
i
tired
of
pretending
of
pretending
said
her
father
ah
yes
her
mother
nodded
at
him
i
tired
of
pretending
too
she
said
in
a
low
voice
gwendolyn
looked
pleased
i
did
know
you
ever
pretended
she
said
well
of
course
you
know
that
things
are
so
much
nicer
ah
yes
my
little
girl
it
was
her
father
his
voice
trembled
real
grass
she
smiled
up
at
him
and
real
trees
and
real
people
after
that
for
a
while
she
gave
herself
over
to
thinking
how
wonderful
that
one
single
night
could
bring
about
the
changes
for
which
she
had
so
longed
the
living
in
the
country
the
eating
at
the
table
and
having
no
governess
one
full
busy
night
had
done
all
that
and
yet
she
glanced
down
at
herself
under
her
pink
chin
was
the
lace
and
ribbon
of
a
she
could
not
remember
being
put
to
bed
could
not
even
recall
coming
up
in
the
bronze
cage
and
was
the
plaid
gingham
with
the
now
hanging
in
the
wardrobe
brows
knit
she
slipped
one
small
foot
sidewise
until
it
was
close
to
the
edge
of
the
then
of
a
sudden
thrust
it
out
from
beneath
them
the
foot
was
as
white
as
if
it
had
only
just
been
bathed
not
a
sign
did
it
show
of
having
waded
any
stream
pattered
through
mud
or
trudged
a
forest
road
presently
sleepily
yes
darling
are
law
and
order
a
moment
silence
then
well
er
is
it
a
question
why
my
baby
but
i
father
will
tell
you
dear
he
was
seated
beside
her
once
more
you
see
it
this
way
can
you
tell
it
like
a
story
yes
a
story
i
try
but
first
you
must
understand
that
law
and
order
are
not
two
people
oh
no
and
they
are
anything
a
little
girl
could
see
as
she
can
see
the
mirror
for
instance
or
a
chair
gwendolyn
looked
at
the
mirror
and
the
chair
thence
around
the
room
these
were
the
same
things
that
had
been
there
all
the
time
now
how
different
each
appeared
there
was
the
bed
for
instance
she
had
never
liked
the
bed
beautiful
though
it
was
yet
even
with
the
sun
shining
on
the
great
panes
of
the
wide
front
window
it
seemed
good
to
be
lying
in
it
and
the
nursery
once
a
hated
place
a
very
prison
the
nursery
had
never
looked
lovelier
her
father
went
on
with
his
explaining
low
and
cheerily
and
as
confidentially
as
if
to
a
across
from
him
listening
was
her
mother
one
soft
cheek
lowered
to
rest
close
to
the
small
face
in
the
pillow
when
her
father
finished
speaking
gwendolyn
gave
a
deep
breath
of
happiness
and
content
then
yes
with
a
kiss
as
light
as
the
touch
of
a
butterfly
her
eyelids
all
at
once
seemed
curiously
heavy
she
let
them
flutter
down
but
a
drowsy
smile
curved
the
pink
mouth
she
whispered
the
dearest
pretend
has
come
true
