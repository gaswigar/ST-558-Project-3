i
it
seemed
to
them
at
first
the
offer
too
good
to
be
true
and
their
friend
letter
addressed
to
them
to
feel
as
he
said
the
ground
to
sound
them
as
to
inclinations
and
possibilities
had
almost
the
effect
of
a
brave
joke
at
their
expense
their
friend
a
highly
preponderant
pushing
person
great
in
discussion
and
arrangement
abrupt
in
overture
unexpected
if
not
perverse
in
attitude
and
almost
equally
acclaimed
and
objected
to
in
the
wide
midland
region
to
which
he
had
taught
as
the
phrase
was
the
size
of
his
foot
their
friend
had
launched
his
bolt
quite
out
of
the
blue
and
had
thereby
so
shaken
them
as
to
make
them
fear
almost
more
than
hope
the
place
had
fallen
vacant
by
the
death
of
one
of
the
two
ladies
mother
and
daughter
who
had
discharged
its
duties
for
fifteen
years
the
daughter
was
staying
on
alone
to
accommodate
but
had
found
though
extremely
mature
an
opportunity
of
marriage
that
involved
retirement
and
the
question
of
the
new
incumbents
was
not
a
little
pressing
the
want
thus
determined
was
of
a
united
couple
of
some
sort
of
the
right
sort
a
pair
of
educated
and
competent
sisters
possibly
preferred
but
a
married
pair
having
its
advantages
if
other
qualifications
were
marked
applicants
candidates
besiegers
of
the
door
of
every
one
supposed
to
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
were
already
beyond
counting
and
who
was
in
his
way
diplomatic
and
whose
voice
though
not
perhaps
of
the
loudest
possessed
notes
of
insistence
had
found
his
preference
fixing
itself
on
some
person
or
brace
of
persons
who
had
been
decent
and
dumb
the
gedges
appeared
to
have
struck
him
as
waiting
in
silence
though
absolutely
as
happened
no
busy
body
had
brought
them
far
away
in
the
north
a
hint
either
of
bliss
or
of
danger
and
the
happy
spell
for
the
rest
had
obviously
been
wrought
in
him
by
a
remembrance
which
though
now
scarcely
fresh
had
never
before
borne
any
such
fruit
morris
gedge
had
for
a
few
years
as
a
young
man
carried
on
a
small
private
school
of
the
order
known
as
preparatory
and
had
happened
then
to
receive
under
his
roof
the
small
son
of
the
great
man
who
was
not
at
that
time
so
great
the
little
boy
during
an
absence
of
his
parents
from
england
had
been
dangerously
ill
so
dangerously
that
they
had
been
recalled
in
haste
though
with
inevitable
delays
from
a
far
country
they
had
gone
to
america
with
the
whole
continent
and
the
great
sea
to
cross
again
and
had
got
back
to
find
the
child
saved
but
saved
as
help
coming
to
light
by
the
extreme
devotion
and
perfect
judgement
of
gedge
without
children
of
her
own
she
had
particularly
attached
herself
to
this
tiniest
and
tenderest
of
her
husband
pupils
and
they
had
both
dreaded
as
a
dire
disaster
the
injury
to
their
little
enterprise
that
would
be
caused
by
their
losing
him
nervous
anxious
sensitive
persons
with
a
pride
as
they
were
for
that
matter
well
aware
above
their
position
never
at
the
best
to
be
anything
but
dingy
they
had
nursed
him
in
terror
and
had
brought
him
through
in
exhaustion
exhaustion
as
befell
had
thus
overtaken
them
early
and
had
for
one
reason
and
another
managed
to
assert
itself
as
their
permanent
portion
the
little
boy
death
would
as
they
said
have
done
for
them
yet
his
recovery
had
saved
them
with
which
it
was
doubtless
also
part
of
a
shy
but
stiff
candour
in
them
that
they
regard
themselves
as
having
in
a
more
indirect
manner
laid
up
treasure
treasure
was
not
to
be
in
any
form
whatever
of
their
dreams
or
of
their
waking
sense
and
the
years
that
followed
had
limped
under
their
weight
had
now
and
then
rather
grievously
stumbled
had
even
barely
escaped
laying
them
in
the
dust
the
school
had
prospered
had
but
dwindled
to
a
close
gedge
health
had
failed
and
still
more
every
sign
in
him
of
a
capacity
to
publish
himself
as
practical
he
had
tried
several
things
he
had
tried
many
but
the
final
appearance
was
of
their
having
tried
him
not
less
they
mostly
at
the
time
i
speak
of
were
trying
his
successors
while
he
found
himself
with
an
effect
of
dull
felicity
that
had
come
in
this
case
from
the
mere
postponement
of
change
in
charge
of
the
grey
of
all
granite
fog
and
female
fiction
this
was
a
situation
in
which
his
general
intelligence
admittedly
his
strong
point
was
doubtless
imaged
around
him
as
feeling
less
of
a
strain
than
that
mastery
of
particulars
in
which
he
was
recognised
as
weak
it
was
at
that
the
silver
shaft
reached
and
pierced
him
it
was
as
an
alternative
to
dispensing
volumes
the
very
titles
of
which
on
the
lips
of
innumerable
glib
girls
were
a
challenge
to
his
nerves
that
the
wardenship
of
so
different
a
temple
presented
itself
the
stipend
named
exceeded
little
the
slim
wage
at
present
paid
him
but
even
had
it
been
less
the
interest
and
the
honour
would
have
struck
him
as
determinant
the
shrine
at
which
he
was
to
preside
though
he
had
always
lacked
occasion
to
approach
it
figured
to
him
as
the
most
sacred
known
to
the
steps
of
men
the
early
home
of
the
supreme
poet
the
mecca
of
the
race
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
sooner
still
than
into
his
wife
while
he
looked
about
with
her
at
their
actual
narrow
prison
so
grim
with
enlightenment
so
ugly
with
industry
so
turned
away
from
any
dream
so
intolerable
to
any
taste
he
felt
as
if
a
window
had
opened
into
a
great
green
woodland
a
woodland
that
had
a
name
all
glorious
immortal
that
was
peopled
with
vivid
figures
each
of
them
renowned
and
that
gave
out
a
murmur
deep
as
the
sound
of
the
sea
which
was
the
rustle
in
forest
shade
of
all
the
poetry
the
beauty
the
colour
of
life
it
would
be
prodigious
that
of
this
transfigured
world
should
keep
the
key
no
he
could
believe
it
not
even
when
isabel
at
sight
of
his
face
came
and
helpfully
kissed
him
he
shook
his
head
with
a
strange
smile
we
get
it
why
should
we
it
perfect
if
we
do
he
simply
have
been
cruel
which
is
impossible
when
he
has
waited
all
this
time
to
be
kind
gedge
did
believe
she
since
the
wide
doors
of
the
world
of
poetry
had
suddenly
pushed
back
for
them
it
was
in
the
form
of
poetic
justice
that
they
were
first
to
know
it
she
had
her
faith
in
their
patron
it
was
sudden
but
now
complete
he
remembers
that
all
and
that
our
strength
and
what
gedge
asked
he
may
want
to
put
us
through
but
a
different
thing
from
being
able
what
are
our
special
advantages
well
that
we
just
the
thing
her
knowledge
of
the
needs
of
the
case
was
as
yet
thanks
to
scant
information
of
the
vaguest
and
she
had
never
more
than
her
husband
stood
on
the
sacred
spot
but
she
saw
herself
waving
a
hand
over
a
collection
of
remarkable
objects
and
saying
to
a
compact
crowd
of
gaping
awestruck
persons
and
now
please
way
she
even
heard
herself
meeting
with
promptness
and
decision
an
occasional
inquiry
from
a
visitor
in
whom
audacity
had
prevailed
over
awe
she
had
once
been
with
a
cousin
years
before
to
a
great
northern
castle
and
that
was
the
way
the
housekeeper
had
taken
them
round
and
it
was
not
moreover
either
that
she
thought
of
herself
as
a
housekeeper
she
was
well
above
that
and
the
wave
of
her
hand
would
fail
to
be
such
as
to
show
it
this
and
much
else
she
summed
up
as
she
answered
her
mate
our
special
advantages
are
that
you
a
gentleman
oh
said
gedge
as
if
he
had
never
thought
of
it
and
yet
as
if
too
it
were
scarce
worth
thinking
of
i
see
it
all
she
went
on
they
the
vulgar
they
find
they
do
do
we
poor
and
we
modest
but
any
one
can
see
what
we
are
gedge
wondered
do
you
mean
more
modest
than
she
he
did
know
quite
what
she
meant
we
refined
we
know
how
to
speak
do
we
he
still
suddenly
wondered
but
she
was
from
the
first
surer
of
everything
than
he
so
that
when
a
few
weeks
more
had
elapsed
and
the
shade
of
uncertainty
though
it
was
only
a
shade
had
grown
almost
to
sicken
him
her
triumph
was
to
come
with
the
news
that
they
were
fairly
named
we
on
poor
pay
though
we
manage
she
had
at
the
present
juncture
contended
for
her
point
but
we
highly
cultivated
and
for
them
to
get
do
you
see
without
getting
too
much
with
it
in
the
way
of
pretensions
and
demands
must
be
precisely
their
dream
we
no
social
position
but
we
do
that
we
have
do
we
a
bit
which
is
because
we
know
the
difference
between
realities
and
shams
we
hold
to
reality
and
that
gives
us
common
sense
which
the
vulgar
have
less
than
anything
and
which
yet
must
be
wanted
there
after
all
as
well
as
anywhere
else
her
companion
followed
her
but
musingly
as
if
his
horizon
had
within
a
few
moments
grown
so
great
that
he
was
almost
lost
in
it
and
required
a
new
orientation
the
shining
spaces
surrounded
him
the
association
alone
gave
a
nobler
arch
to
the
sky
allow
that
we
hold
also
a
little
to
the
romance
it
seems
to
me
that
that
the
beauty
we
missed
it
all
our
life
and
now
it
come
we
shall
be
at
headquarters
for
it
we
shall
have
our
fill
of
it
she
looked
at
his
face
at
the
effect
in
it
of
these
prospects
and
her
own
lighted
as
if
he
had
suddenly
grown
handsome
certainly
we
shall
live
as
in
a
but
what
i
mean
is
that
we
shall
give
in
a
way
and
so
gladly
quite
as
much
as
we
get
with
all
the
rest
of
it
we
for
instance
neat
their
letter
had
come
to
them
at
breakfast
and
she
picked
a
fly
out
of
the
it
the
way
we
the
place
with
which
she
removed
from
the
sofa
to
the
top
of
the
a
tin
of
biscuits
that
had
refused
to
squeeze
into
the
cupboard
at
blackport
they
were
in
lodgings
of
the
lowest
description
she
had
been
known
to
declare
with
a
freedom
felt
by
blackport
to
be
slightly
invidious
the
birthplace
and
that
itself
after
such
a
life
was
exaltation
would
be
lodgings
since
a
house
close
beside
it
was
set
apart
for
the
warden
a
house
joining
on
to
it
as
a
sweet
old
parsonage
is
often
annexed
to
a
quaint
old
church
it
would
all
together
be
their
home
and
such
a
home
as
would
make
a
little
world
that
they
would
never
want
to
leave
she
dwelt
on
the
gain
for
that
matter
to
their
income
as
obviously
though
the
salary
was
not
a
change
for
the
better
the
house
given
them
would
make
all
the
difference
he
assented
to
this
but
absently
and
she
was
almost
impatient
at
the
range
of
his
thoughts
it
was
as
if
something
for
him
the
very
swarm
of
them
veiled
the
view
and
he
presently
of
himself
showed
what
it
was
what
i
ca
get
over
is
its
being
such
a
man
he
almost
from
inward
emotion
broke
down
such
a
man
him
him
it
was
too
much
yes
it
a
surprise
but
one
sees
how
he
has
been
meaning
all
the
while
the
right
thing
by
us
i
mean
gedge
returned
more
coldly
our
becoming
familiar
and
intimate
for
that
what
it
will
come
to
we
shall
just
live
with
him
of
course
it
the
beauty
and
she
added
quite
gaily
the
more
we
do
the
more
we
shall
love
him
no
doubt
but
it
rather
awful
the
more
we
him
gedge
reflected
the
more
we
shall
love
him
we
do
as
yet
you
see
know
him
so
very
tremendously
we
do
so
quite
as
well
i
imagine
as
the
sort
of
people
they
had
and
that
probably
is
unless
you
care
as
we
do
so
awfully
necessary
for
there
are
the
facts
yes
there
are
the
facts
i
mean
the
principal
ones
they
all
that
the
people
the
people
who
come
want
yes
they
must
be
all
want
so
that
they
all
that
those
who
been
in
charge
have
needed
to
know
ah
he
said
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
honour
we
must
know
everything
she
cheerfully
acceded
she
had
the
merit
he
felt
of
keeping
the
case
within
bounds
everything
but
about
him
personally
she
added
there
is
is
there
so
very
very
much
more
i
believe
than
there
used
to
be
they
made
discoveries
it
was
a
grand
thought
perhaps
shall
make
some
oh
i
shall
be
content
to
be
a
little
better
up
in
what
has
been
done
and
his
eyes
rested
on
a
shelf
of
books
half
of
which
little
worn
but
much
faded
were
of
the
florid
gift
order
and
belonged
to
the
house
of
those
among
them
that
were
his
own
most
were
common
specimens
of
the
reference
sort
not
excluding
an
old
bradshaw
and
a
catalogue
of
the
we
not
even
a
set
of
our
own
of
the
works
he
explained
in
quick
repudiation
of
the
sense
perhaps
more
obvious
in
which
she
might
have
taken
it
as
a
proof
of
their
scant
range
of
possessions
this
sounded
almost
abject
till
the
painful
flush
with
which
they
met
on
the
admission
melted
presently
into
a
different
glow
it
was
just
for
that
kind
of
poorness
that
their
new
situation
was
by
its
intrinsic
charm
to
console
them
and
gedge
had
a
happy
thought
would
the
library
more
or
less
have
them
oh
no
we
nothing
of
that
sort
for
what
do
you
take
us
this
however
was
but
the
play
of
gedge
high
spirits
the
form
both
depression
and
exhilaration
most
frequently
took
with
him
being
a
bitterness
on
the
subject
of
the
literary
taste
of
blackport
no
one
was
so
deeply
acquainted
with
it
it
acted
with
him
in
fact
as
so
lurid
a
sign
of
the
future
that
the
charm
of
the
thought
of
removal
was
sharply
enhanced
by
the
prospect
of
escape
from
it
the
institution
he
served
did
of
course
deserve
the
particular
reproach
into
which
his
irony
had
flowered
and
indeed
if
the
several
sets
in
which
the
works
were
present
were
a
trifle
dusty
the
dust
was
a
little
his
own
fault
to
make
up
for
that
now
he
had
the
vision
of
immediately
giving
his
time
to
the
study
of
them
he
saw
himself
indeed
inflamed
with
a
new
passion
earnestly
commenting
and
collating
gedge
who
had
suggested
that
till
their
move
should
come
they
ought
to
read
him
regularly
of
an
evening
certain
as
they
were
to
do
it
still
more
when
in
closer
quarters
with
him
gedge
felt
also
in
her
degree
the
spell
so
that
the
very
happiest
time
of
their
anxious
life
was
perhaps
to
have
been
the
series
of
lamplight
hours
after
supper
in
which
alternately
taking
the
book
they
declaimed
they
almost
performed
their
beneficent
author
he
became
speedily
more
than
their
author
their
personal
friend
their
universal
light
their
final
authority
and
divinity
where
in
the
world
they
were
already
asking
themselves
would
they
have
been
without
him
by
the
time
their
appointment
arrived
in
form
their
relation
to
him
had
immensely
developed
it
was
amusing
to
morris
gedge
that
he
had
so
lately
blushed
for
his
ignorance
and
he
made
this
remark
to
his
wife
during
the
last
hour
they
were
able
to
give
their
study
before
proceeding
across
half
the
country
to
the
scene
of
their
romantic
future
it
was
as
if
in
deep
close
throbs
in
cool
that
broke
of
a
sudden
and
bathed
his
mind
all
possession
and
comprehension
and
sympathy
all
the
truth
and
the
life
and
the
story
had
come
to
him
and
come
as
the
newspapers
said
to
stay
it
absurd
he
did
hesitate
to
say
to
talk
of
our
not
so
far
as
we
do
it
because
we
dunces
he
the
thing
over
his
ears
and
the
more
we
get
into
it
the
more
we
with
him
i
seem
to
myself
at
any
rate
he
declared
to
him
in
it
as
if
he
were
painted
on
the
wall
oh
one
rather
the
dear
thing
and
do
you
feel
where
it
is
gedge
finely
asked
we
see
him
because
we
love
him
that
what
we
do
how
can
we
not
the
old
darling
with
what
he
doing
for
us
no
light
she
had
a
sententious
turn
like
true
affection
yes
i
suppose
that
it
and
yet
her
husband
mused
i
see
confound
me
the
faults
that
because
you
so
critical
you
see
them
but
you
do
mind
them
you
see
them
but
you
forgive
them
you
must
mention
them
we
sha
you
know
be
there
for
dear
no
he
laughed
we
chuck
out
any
one
who
hints
at
them
ii
if
the
sweetness
of
the
preliminary
months
had
been
great
great
too
though
almost
excessive
as
agitation
was
the
wonder
of
fairly
being
housed
with
him
of
treading
day
and
night
in
the
footsteps
he
had
worn
of
touching
the
objects
or
at
all
events
the
surfaces
the
substances
over
which
his
hands
had
played
which
his
arms
his
shoulders
had
rubbed
of
breathing
the
air
or
something
not
too
unlike
it
in
which
his
voice
had
sounded
they
had
had
a
little
at
first
their
bewilderments
their
disconcertedness
the
place
was
both
humbler
and
grander
than
they
had
exactly
prefigured
more
at
once
of
a
cottage
and
of
a
museum
a
little
more
archaically
bare
and
yet
a
little
more
richly
official
but
the
sense
was
strong
with
them
that
the
point
of
view
for
the
inevitable
ease
of
the
connexion
patiently
indulgently
awaited
them
in
addition
to
which
from
the
first
evening
after
when
the
last
blank
pilgrim
had
gone
the
mere
spell
the
mystic
presence
as
if
they
had
had
it
quite
to
themselves
were
all
they
could
have
desired
they
had
received
at
behest
and
in
addition
to
a
table
of
instructions
and
admonitions
by
the
number
and
in
some
particulars
by
the
nature
of
which
they
found
themselves
slightly
depressed
various
little
guides
manuals
travellers
tributes
literary
memorials
and
other
publications
which
however
were
to
be
for
the
moment
swallowed
up
in
the
interesting
episode
of
the
induction
or
initiation
appointed
for
them
in
advance
at
the
hands
of
several
persons
whose
relation
to
the
establishment
was
as
superior
to
their
own
still
more
official
and
at
those
in
especial
of
one
of
the
ladies
who
had
for
so
many
years
borne
the
brunt
about
the
instructions
from
above
about
the
shilling
books
and
the
facts
and
the
legend
the
supervision
the
subjection
the
submission
the
view
as
of
a
cage
in
which
he
should
circulate
and
a
groove
in
which
he
should
slide
gedge
had
preserved
a
certain
play
of
mind
but
all
power
of
reaction
appeared
suddenly
to
desert
him
in
the
presence
of
his
so
visibly
competent
predecessor
and
as
an
effect
of
her
good
offices
he
had
not
the
resource
enjoyed
by
his
wife
of
seeing
himself
with
impatience
attired
in
black
silk
of
a
make
characterised
by
just
the
right
shade
of
austerity
so
that
this
firm
smooth
expert
and
consummately
respectable
person
had
him
somehow
on
the
whole
ground
completely
at
her
mercy
it
was
evidently
something
of
a
rueful
moment
when
as
a
lesson
she
being
for
the
day
or
two
still
in
the
field
he
accepted
miss
suggestion
of
going
round
with
her
and
with
the
successive
squads
of
visitors
she
was
there
to
deal
with
he
appreciated
her
method
he
saw
there
had
to
be
one
he
admired
her
as
succinct
and
definite
for
there
were
the
facts
as
his
wife
had
said
at
blackport
and
they
were
to
be
disposed
of
in
the
time
yet
he
felt
a
very
little
boy
as
he
dangled
more
than
once
with
gedge
at
the
tail
of
the
human
comet
the
idea
had
been
that
they
should
by
this
attendance
more
fully
embrace
the
possible
accidents
and
incidents
so
to
put
it
of
the
relation
to
the
great
public
in
which
they
were
to
find
themselves
and
the
poor
man
excited
perception
of
the
great
public
rapidly
became
such
as
to
resist
any
diversion
meaner
than
that
of
the
admirable
manner
of
their
guide
it
wandered
from
his
gaping
companions
to
that
of
the
priestess
in
black
silk
whom
he
kept
asking
himself
if
either
he
or
isabel
could
hope
by
any
possibility
ever
remotely
to
resemble
then
it
bounded
restlessly
back
to
the
numerous
persons
who
revealed
to
him
as
it
had
never
yet
been
revealed
the
happy
power
of
the
simple
to
hang
upon
the
lips
of
the
wise
the
great
thing
seemed
to
be
and
quite
surprisingly
that
the
business
was
easy
and
the
strain
which
as
a
strain
they
had
feared
moderate
so
that
he
might
have
been
puzzled
had
he
fairly
caught
himself
in
the
act
by
his
recognising
as
the
last
effect
of
the
impression
an
odd
absence
of
the
power
really
to
rest
in
it
an
agitation
deep
within
him
that
vaguely
threatened
to
grow
it
is
you
see
so
very
complicated
the
black
silk
lady
seemed
to
throw
off
with
everything
else
in
her
neat
crisp
cheerful
way
in
spite
of
which
he
already
the
very
first
time
that
is
after
several
parties
had
been
in
and
out
and
up
and
down
went
so
far
as
to
wonder
if
there
were
more
in
it
than
she
imagined
she
was
so
to
speak
kindness
itself
was
all
encouragement
and
reassurance
but
it
was
just
her
slightly
coarse
redolence
of
these
very
things
that
on
repetition
before
they
parted
dimmed
a
little
as
he
felt
the
light
of
his
acknowledging
smile
this
again
she
took
for
a
symptom
of
some
pleading
weakness
in
him
he
could
never
be
as
brave
as
she
so
that
she
wound
up
with
a
few
pleasant
words
from
the
very
depth
of
her
experience
get
into
it
never
fear
it
will
and
then
you
feel
as
if
you
had
never
done
anything
else
he
was
afterwards
to
know
that
on
the
spot
at
this
moment
he
must
have
begun
to
wince
a
little
at
such
a
menace
that
he
might
come
to
feel
as
if
he
had
never
done
anything
but
what
miss
putchin
did
loomed
for
him
in
germ
as
a
penalty
to
pay
the
support
she
offered
none
the
less
continued
to
strike
him
she
put
the
whole
thing
on
so
sound
a
basis
when
she
said
you
see
they
so
nice
about
it
they
take
such
an
interest
and
they
never
do
a
thing
they
should
that
was
always
every
thing
to
mother
and
me
they
gedge
had
already
noticed
referred
constantly
and
hugely
in
the
good
woman
talk
to
the
millions
who
shuffled
through
the
house
the
pronoun
in
question
was
for
ever
on
her
lips
the
hordes
it
represented
filled
her
consciousness
the
addition
of
their
numbers
ministered
to
her
glory
gedge
promptly
fell
in
it
must
be
indeed
delightful
to
see
the
effect
on
so
many
and
to
feel
that
one
may
perhaps
do
something
to
make
it
well
permanent
but
he
was
kept
silent
by
his
becoming
more
sharply
aware
that
this
was
a
new
view
for
him
of
the
reference
made
that
he
had
never
thought
of
the
quality
of
the
place
as
derived
from
them
but
from
somebody
else
and
that
they
in
short
seemed
to
have
got
into
the
way
of
crowding
him
out
he
found
himself
even
a
little
resenting
this
for
him
which
perhaps
had
something
to
do
with
the
slightly
invidious
cast
of
his
next
inquiry
and
are
they
always
as
one
might
say
a
stupid
stupid
she
stared
looking
as
if
no
one
be
such
a
thing
in
such
a
connexion
no
one
had
ever
been
anything
but
neat
and
cheerful
and
fluent
except
to
be
attentive
and
unobjectionable
and
so
far
as
was
possible
american
what
i
mean
is
he
explained
is
there
any
perceptible
proportion
that
take
an
interest
in
him
his
wife
stepped
on
his
toe
she
deprecated
levity
but
his
mistake
fortunately
was
lost
on
their
friend
that
just
why
they
come
that
they
take
such
an
interest
i
sometimes
think
they
take
more
than
about
anything
else
in
the
world
with
which
miss
putchin
looked
about
at
the
place
it
pretty
do
you
think
the
way
they
got
it
now
this
gedge
saw
was
a
different
they
it
applied
to
the
powers
that
were
the
people
who
had
appointed
him
the
governing
visiting
body
in
respect
to
which
he
was
afterwards
to
remark
to
gedge
that
a
fellow
it
was
the
difficulty
did
know
where
to
have
her
his
wife
at
a
loss
questioned
at
that
moment
the
necessity
of
having
her
anywhere
and
he
said
of
course
it
all
right
he
was
in
fact
content
enough
with
the
last
touches
their
friend
had
given
the
picture
there
are
many
who
know
all
about
it
when
they
come
and
the
americans
often
are
tremendously
up
mother
and
me
really
enjoyed
it
was
her
only
slip
the
interest
of
the
americans
sometimes
had
ninety
a
day
and
all
wanting
to
see
and
hear
everything
but
you
work
them
off
you
see
the
way
it
all
experience
she
came
back
for
his
comfort
to
that
she
came
back
also
to
other
things
she
did
justice
to
the
considerable
class
who
arrived
positive
and
primed
there
are
those
who
know
more
about
it
than
you
do
but
only
comes
from
their
interest
who
know
more
about
what
gedge
inquired
why
about
the
place
i
mean
they
have
their
ideas
of
what
everything
is
and
it
is
and
what
it
is
and
where
it
be
they
do
ask
questions
she
said
yet
not
so
much
in
warning
as
in
the
complacency
of
being
herself
seasoned
and
sound
and
they
down
on
you
when
they
think
you
go
wrong
as
if
you
ever
could
you
know
too
much
she
astutely
smiled
or
you
oh
you
must
know
much
must
you
and
gedge
now
smiled
as
well
he
knew
he
thought
what
he
meant
well
you
must
know
as
much
as
anybody
else
i
claim
at
any
rate
that
i
do
miss
putchin
declared
they
never
really
caught
me
out
i
very
certain
of
and
gedge
had
an
elation
almost
personal
surely
he
said
i
do
want
to
be
caught
out
she
rejoined
that
in
such
a
case
he
would
have
down
on
him
and
he
saw
that
this
time
she
meant
the
powers
above
it
quickened
his
sense
of
all
the
elements
that
were
to
reckon
with
yet
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
the
powers
above
were
not
what
he
should
most
fear
i
glad
he
observed
that
they
ever
ask
questions
but
i
happened
to
notice
you
know
that
no
one
did
then
you
missed
several
and
no
loss
there
were
three
or
four
put
to
me
too
silly
to
remember
but
of
course
they
mostly
silly
you
mean
the
questions
she
laughed
with
all
her
cheer
yes
sir
i
do
mean
the
answers
whereupon
for
a
moment
snubbed
and
silent
he
felt
like
one
of
the
crowd
then
it
made
him
slightly
vicious
i
did
know
but
you
meant
the
people
in
general
till
i
remembered
that
i
to
understand
from
you
that
wise
only
occasionally
breaking
down
it
was
really
till
then
he
thought
that
she
lost
patience
and
he
had
had
much
more
than
he
meant
no
doubt
a
air
you
see
for
yourself
of
which
he
was
sure
enough
he
was
in
fact
so
ready
to
take
this
that
she
came
round
to
full
accommodation
put
it
frankly
that
every
now
and
then
they
broke
out
not
the
silly
oh
no
the
intensely
inquiring
we
had
quite
lively
discussions
do
you
know
about
points
they
want
it
all
way
and
i
know
the
sort
that
are
going
to
as
soon
as
i
see
them
that
one
of
the
things
you
do
you
get
to
know
the
sorts
and
if
it
what
you
afraid
of
their
taking
you
up
she
was
further
gracious
enough
to
say
you
need
mind
a
bit
what
they
know
after
all
when
for
us
it
our
life
i
never
moved
an
inch
because
you
see
i
should
have
been
here
if
i
did
know
where
i
was
no
more
will
be
a
year
hence
you
know
what
i
mean
putting
it
impossibly
if
you
do
i
expect
you
do
in
spite
of
your
fancies
and
she
dropped
once
more
to
there
are
the
facts
otherwise
where
would
any
of
us
be
that
all
you
got
to
go
upon
a
person
however
cheeky
ca
have
them
way
just
because
he
takes
it
into
his
head
there
can
only
be
way
and
she
gaily
added
as
she
took
leave
of
them
i
sure
it
quite
enough
iii
gedge
not
only
assented
eagerly
one
way
quite
enough
if
it
were
the
right
one
but
repeated
it
after
this
conversation
at
odd
moments
several
times
over
to
his
wife
there
can
only
be
one
way
one
way
he
continued
to
remark
though
indeed
much
as
if
it
were
a
joke
till
she
asked
him
how
many
more
he
supposed
she
wanted
he
failed
to
answer
this
question
but
resorted
to
another
repetition
there
are
the
facts
the
facts
which
perhaps
however
he
kept
a
little
more
to
himself
sounding
it
at
intervals
in
different
parts
of
the
house
gedge
was
full
of
comment
on
their
clever
introductress
though
not
restrictively
save
in
the
matter
of
her
speech
me
and
mother
and
a
general
tone
which
certainly
was
not
their
sort
of
thing
i
do
know
he
said
perhaps
it
comes
with
the
place
since
speaking
in
immortal
verse
does
seem
to
come
it
must
be
one
seems
to
see
one
thing
or
the
other
i
daresay
that
in
a
few
months
i
shall
also
be
at
it
and
the
wife
why
not
and
the
missus
at
once
gedge
resentfully
inquired
i
do
think
she
observed
at
another
time
that
i
quite
know
what
the
matter
with
you
it
only
that
i
excited
awfully
excited
as
i
do
see
how
one
be
you
would
have
a
fellow
drop
into
this
berth
as
into
an
appointment
at
the
post
office
here
on
the
spot
it
goes
to
my
head
how
can
that
be
helped
but
we
shall
live
into
it
and
perhaps
he
said
with
an
implication
of
the
other
possibility
that
was
doubtless
but
part
of
his
fine
ecstasy
we
shall
live
through
it
the
place
acted
on
his
imagination
how
surely
should
it
and
his
imagination
acted
on
his
nerves
and
these
things
together
with
the
general
vividness
and
the
new
and
complete
immersion
made
rest
for
him
almost
impossible
so
that
he
could
scarce
go
to
bed
at
night
and
even
during
the
first
week
more
than
once
rose
in
the
small
hours
to
move
about
up
and
down
with
his
lamp
standing
sitting
listening
wondering
in
the
stillness
as
if
positively
to
recover
some
echo
to
surprise
some
secret
of
the
he
could
have
explained
it
and
did
in
fact
need
to
explain
it
at
least
to
himself
since
the
impulse
simply
held
him
and
shook
him
but
the
time
after
closing
the
time
above
all
after
the
people
them
as
he
felt
himself
on
the
way
habitually
to
put
it
predominant
insistent
all
in
the
foreground
brought
him
or
ought
to
have
brought
him
he
seemed
to
see
nearer
to
the
enshrined
presence
enlarging
the
opportunity
for
communion
and
intensifying
the
sense
of
it
these
nightly
prowls
as
he
called
them
were
disquieting
to
his
wife
who
had
no
disposition
to
share
in
them
speaking
with
decision
of
the
whole
place
as
just
the
place
to
be
forbidding
after
dark
she
rejoiced
in
the
distinctness
contiguous
though
it
was
of
their
own
little
residence
where
she
trimmed
the
lamp
and
stirred
the
fire
and
heard
the
kettle
sing
repairing
the
while
the
omissions
of
the
small
domestic
who
slept
out
she
foresaw
her
self
with
some
promptness
drawing
rather
sharply
the
line
between
her
own
precinct
and
that
in
which
the
great
spirit
might
walk
it
would
be
with
them
the
great
spirit
all
day
even
if
indeed
on
her
making
that
remark
and
in
just
that
form
to
her
husband
he
replied
with
a
queer
but
will
he
though
and
she
vaguely
imaged
the
development
of
a
domestic
antidote
after
a
while
precisely
in
the
shape
of
curtains
more
markedly
drawn
and
everything
most
modern
and
lively
tea
patterns
the
newspapers
the
female
fiction
itself
that
they
had
reacted
against
at
blackport
quite
defiantly
cultivated
these
possibilities
however
were
all
right
as
her
companion
said
it
was
all
the
first
autumn
they
had
arrived
at
summer
end
and
he
might
have
been
more
than
content
with
a
special
set
of
his
own
that
he
had
access
to
from
behind
passing
out
of
their
low
door
for
the
few
steps
between
it
and
the
birthplace
with
his
lamp
ever
so
carefully
guarded
and
his
nursed
keys
that
made
him
free
of
treasures
he
crossed
the
dusky
interval
so
often
that
she
began
to
qualify
it
as
a
habit
that
grew
she
spoke
of
it
almost
as
if
he
had
taken
to
drink
and
he
humoured
that
view
of
it
by
allowing
the
cup
to
be
strong
this
had
been
in
truth
altogether
his
immediate
sense
of
it
strange
and
deep
for
him
the
spell
of
silent
sessions
before
familiarity
and
to
some
small
extent
disappointment
had
set
in
the
exhibitional
side
of
the
establishment
had
struck
him
even
on
arrival
as
qualifying
too
much
its
character
he
scarce
knew
what
he
might
best
have
looked
for
but
the
three
or
four
rooms
bristled
overmuch
in
the
garish
light
of
day
with
busts
and
relics
not
even
ostensibly
always
old
prints
and
old
editions
old
objects
fashioned
in
his
likeness
furniture
of
the
time
and
autographs
of
celebrated
worshippers
in
the
quiet
hours
and
the
deep
dusk
none
the
less
under
the
play
of
the
shifted
lamp
and
that
of
his
own
emotion
these
things
too
recovered
their
advantage
ministered
to
the
mystery
or
at
all
events
to
the
impression
seemed
consciously
to
offer
themselves
as
personal
to
the
poet
not
one
of
them
was
really
or
unchallengeably
so
but
they
had
somehow
through
long
association
got
as
gedge
always
phrased
it
into
the
secret
and
it
was
about
the
secret
he
asked
them
while
he
restlessly
wandered
it
was
till
months
had
elapsed
that
he
found
how
little
they
had
to
tell
him
and
he
was
quite
at
his
ease
with
them
when
he
knew
they
were
by
no
means
where
his
sensibility
had
first
placed
them
they
were
as
out
of
it
as
he
only
to
do
them
justice
they
had
made
him
immensely
feel
and
still
too
it
was
not
they
who
had
done
that
most
since
his
sentiment
had
gradually
cleared
itself
to
deep
to
deeper
refinements
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
birthplace
was
the
low
the
sublime
chamber
of
birth
sublime
because
as
the
americans
usually
said
unlike
the
natives
they
mostly
found
words
it
was
so
pathetic
and
pathetic
because
it
was
well
really
nothing
else
in
the
world
that
one
could
name
number
or
measure
it
was
as
empty
as
a
shell
of
which
the
kernel
has
withered
and
contained
neither
busts
nor
prints
nor
early
copies
it
contained
only
the
fact
fact
itself
which
as
he
stood
sentient
there
at
midnight
our
friend
holding
his
breath
allowed
to
sink
into
him
he
to
take
it
as
the
place
where
the
spirit
would
most
walk
and
where
he
would
therefore
be
most
to
be
met
with
possibilities
of
recognition
and
reciprocity
he
had
most
probably
had
much
inhabited
the
room
as
men
apt
as
a
rule
to
convert
to
their
later
use
and
involve
in
their
wider
fortune
the
scene
itself
of
their
nativity
but
as
there
were
moments
when
in
the
conflict
of
theories
the
sole
certainty
surviving
for
the
critic
threatened
to
be
that
he
had
not
unlike
other
successful
men
been
born
so
gedge
though
little
of
a
critic
clung
to
the
square
feet
of
space
that
connected
themselves
however
feebly
with
the
positive
appearance
he
was
little
of
a
critic
he
was
nothing
of
one
he
pretended
to
the
character
before
coming
nor
come
to
pretend
to
it
also
luckily
for
him
he
was
seeing
day
by
day
how
little
use
he
could
possibly
have
for
it
it
would
be
to
him
the
attitude
of
a
high
expert
distinctly
a
and
that
he
rejoiced
as
the
winter
waned
in
his
ignorance
was
one
of
the
propositions
he
betook
himself
in
his
odd
manner
to
enunciating
to
his
wife
she
denied
it
for
had
she
in
the
first
place
been
present
was
she
still
present
at
his
pious
his
tireless
study
of
everything
connected
with
the
subject
so
present
that
she
had
herself
learned
more
about
it
than
had
ever
seemed
likely
then
in
the
second
place
he
was
to
proclaim
on
the
any
point
at
which
he
might
be
weak
for
who
knew
if
it
should
get
abroad
that
they
were
ignorant
what
effect
might
be
produced
on
the
attraction
he
took
her
up
of
the
show
he
had
fallen
into
the
harmless
habit
of
speaking
of
the
place
as
the
show
but
she
did
mind
this
so
much
as
to
be
diverted
by
it
no
on
the
attitude
of
the
body
you
know
they
pleased
with
us
and
i
do
see
why
you
should
want
to
spoil
it
we
got
in
by
a
tight
squeeze
you
know
we
had
evidence
of
that
and
that
it
was
about
as
much
as
our
backers
could
manage
but
we
proving
a
comfort
to
them
and
it
absurd
of
you
to
question
your
suitability
to
people
who
were
content
with
the
putchins
i
do
my
dear
he
returned
question
any
thing
but
if
i
should
do
so
it
would
be
precisely
because
of
the
greater
advantage
constituted
for
the
putchins
by
the
simplicity
of
their
spirit
they
were
kept
straight
by
the
quality
of
their
ignorance
which
was
denser
even
than
mine
it
was
a
mistake
in
us
from
the
first
to
have
attempted
to
correct
or
to
disguise
ours
we
should
have
waited
simply
to
become
good
parrots
to
learn
our
lesson
all
on
the
spot
here
so
little
of
it
is
wanted
and
squawk
it
off
ah
love
what
a
word
to
use
about
him
it
is
about
him
nothing
about
him
none
of
them
care
tuppence
about
him
the
only
thing
they
care
about
is
this
empty
shell
or
rather
for
it
is
empty
the
extraneous
preposterous
stuffing
of
it
preposterous
he
made
her
stare
with
this
as
he
had
yet
done
at
sight
of
her
look
however
the
gleam
as
it
might
have
been
of
a
queer
suspicion
he
bent
to
her
kindly
and
tapped
her
cheek
oh
it
all
right
we
fall
back
on
the
putchins
do
you
remember
what
she
said
made
it
so
pretty
now
they
made
it
pretty
and
it
a
show
it
a
show
and
a
billet
and
he
was
a
poet
and
you
a
woman
to
put
up
so
sweetly
i
mean
with
my
nonsense
she
appreciated
his
domestic
charm
and
she
justified
that
part
of
his
tribute
which
concerned
herself
i
do
care
how
much
of
your
nonsense
you
talk
to
me
so
long
as
you
it
all
for
me
and
do
treat
to
it
the
pilgrims
no
he
conceded
it
is
fair
to
them
they
mean
well
what
complaint
have
we
after
all
to
make
of
them
so
long
as
they
break
off
bits
as
they
used
miss
putchin
told
us
so
awfully
in
order
to
conceal
them
about
their
persons
she
broke
them
at
least
of
that
yes
gedge
mused
again
i
wish
awfully
she
had
you
like
the
relics
destroyed
removed
that
all
that
wanted
there
no
relics
there
wo
be
any
unless
you
take
care
but
he
was
already
laughing
and
the
talk
was
dropped
without
his
having
patted
her
once
more
an
impression
or
two
nevertheless
remained
with
her
from
it
as
he
saw
from
a
question
she
asked
him
on
the
morrow
what
did
you
mean
yesterday
about
miss
putchin
simplicity
its
keeping
her
do
you
mean
mentally
her
mentally
was
rather
portentous
but
he
practically
confessed
well
it
kept
her
up
i
mean
he
amended
laughing
it
kept
her
down
it
was
really
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
uneasy
you
consider
there
a
danger
of
your
being
affected
you
know
what
i
mean
of
its
going
to
your
head
you
do
know
she
insisted
as
he
said
nothing
through
your
caring
for
him
so
you
certainly
be
right
in
that
case
about
its
having
been
a
mistake
for
you
to
plunge
so
deep
and
then
as
his
listening
without
reply
though
with
his
look
a
little
sad
for
her
might
have
denoted
that
allowing
for
extravagance
of
statement
he
saw
there
was
something
in
it
give
up
your
prowls
keep
it
for
daylight
keep
it
for
ah
he
smiled
if
one
could
my
prowls
he
added
are
what
i
most
enjoy
they
the
only
time
as
i
told
you
before
that
i
really
with
then
i
do
see
the
place
he
is
the
place
i
do
care
for
what
you
see
she
returned
with
vivacity
the
question
is
of
what
you
do
see
well
if
it
was
he
waited
before
meeting
it
do
you
know
what
i
sometimes
do
and
then
as
she
waited
too
in
the
birthroom
there
when
i
look
in
late
i
often
put
out
my
light
that
makes
it
better
makes
what
everything
what
is
it
then
you
see
in
the
dark
nothing
said
morris
gedge
and
what
the
pleasure
of
that
well
what
the
american
ladies
say
it
so
fascinating
iv
the
autumn
was
brisk
as
miss
putchin
had
told
them
it
would
be
but
business
naturally
fell
off
with
the
winter
months
and
the
short
days
there
was
rarely
an
hour
indeed
without
a
call
of
some
sort
and
they
were
never
allowed
to
forget
that
they
kept
the
shop
in
all
the
world
as
they
might
say
where
custom
was
least
fluctuating
the
seasons
told
on
it
as
they
tell
on
travel
but
no
other
influence
consideration
or
convulsion
to
which
the
population
of
the
globe
is
exposed
this
population
never
exactly
in
simultaneous
hordes
but
in
a
full
swift
and
steady
stream
passed
through
the
mill
and
went
in
its
variety
of
degrees
duly
impressed
and
edified
on
its
artless
way
gedge
gave
himself
up
with
much
ingenuity
of
spirit
to
trying
to
keep
in
relation
with
it
having
even
at
moments
in
the
early
time
glimpses
of
the
chance
that
the
impressions
gathered
from
so
rare
an
opportunity
for
contact
with
the
general
mind
might
prove
as
interesting
as
anything
else
in
the
connexion
types
classes
nationalities
manners
diversities
of
behaviour
modes
of
seeing
feeling
of
expression
would
pass
before
him
and
become
for
him
after
a
fashion
the
experience
of
an
untravelled
man
his
journeys
had
been
short
and
saving
but
poetic
justice
again
seemed
inclined
to
work
for
him
in
placing
him
just
at
the
point
in
all
europe
perhaps
where
the
confluence
of
races
was
thickest
the
theory
at
any
rate
carried
him
on
operating
helpfully
for
the
term
of
his
anxious
beginnings
and
gilding
in
a
manner
it
was
the
way
he
characterised
the
case
to
his
wife
the
somewhat
stodgy
gingerbread
of
their
daily
routine
they
had
known
many
people
and
their
was
small
which
made
it
again
poetic
justice
that
they
should
be
visited
on
such
a
scale
they
dressed
and
were
at
home
they
were
under
arms
and
received
and
except
for
the
offer
of
refreshment
and
gedge
had
his
view
that
there
would
eventually
be
a
farmed
out
to
a
great
firm
their
hospitality
would
have
made
them
princely
if
mere
hospitality
ever
did
thus
they
were
launched
and
it
was
interesting
so
that
from
having
been
ready
to
drop
originally
with
fatigue
they
emerged
as
and
strong
in
the
legs
as
if
they
had
had
an
alpine
holiday
this
experience
gedge
opined
also
represented
as
a
gain
a
like
seasoning
of
the
spirit
by
which
he
meant
a
certain
command
of
impenetrable
patience
the
patience
was
needed
for
the
particular
feature
of
the
ordeal
that
by
the
time
the
lively
season
was
with
them
again
had
disengaged
itself
as
the
sharpest
the
immense
assumption
of
veracities
and
sanctities
of
the
general
soundness
of
the
legend
with
which
every
one
arrived
he
was
well
provided
certainly
for
meeting
it
and
he
gave
all
he
had
yet
he
had
sometimes
the
sense
of
a
vague
resentment
on
the
part
of
his
pilgrims
at
his
not
ladling
out
their
fare
with
a
bigger
spoon
an
irritation
had
begun
to
grumble
in
him
during
the
comparatively
idle
months
of
winter
when
a
pilgrim
would
turn
up
singly
the
pious
individual
entertained
for
the
had
occasionally
seemed
to
offer
him
the
promise
of
beguilement
or
the
semblance
of
a
personal
relation
it
came
back
again
to
the
few
pleasant
calls
he
had
received
in
the
course
of
a
life
almost
void
of
social
amenity
sometimes
he
liked
the
person
the
face
the
speech
an
educated
man
a
gentleman
not
one
of
the
herd
a
graceful
woman
vague
accidental
unconscious
of
him
but
making
him
wonder
while
he
hovered
who
she
was
these
chances
represented
for
him
light
yearnings
and
faint
flutters
they
acted
indeed
within
him
to
a
special
an
extraordinary
tune
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
with
such
stray
companions
to
talk
with
them
to
talk
with
them
as
he
might
have
talked
had
he
met
them
where
he
could
meet
them
at
dinner
in
the
world
on
a
visit
at
a
then
he
could
have
said
and
about
the
shrine
and
the
idol
always
things
he
could
say
now
the
form
in
which
his
irritation
first
came
to
him
was
that
of
his
feeling
obliged
to
say
to
them
to
the
single
visitor
even
when
sympathetic
quite
as
to
the
gaping
group
the
particular
things
a
dreadful
dozen
or
so
that
they
expected
if
he
had
thus
arrived
at
characterising
these
things
as
dreadful
the
reason
touched
the
very
point
that
for
a
while
turning
everything
over
he
kept
dodging
not
facing
trying
to
ignore
the
point
was
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
become
two
quite
different
persons
the
public
and
the
private
as
to
which
it
would
somehow
have
to
be
managed
that
these
persons
should
live
together
he
was
splitting
into
halves
unmistakably
he
who
whatever
else
he
had
been
had
at
least
always
been
so
entire
and
in
his
way
so
solid
one
of
the
halves
or
perhaps
even
since
the
split
promised
to
be
rather
unequal
one
of
the
quarters
was
the
keeper
the
showman
the
priest
of
the
idol
the
other
piece
was
the
poor
unsuccessful
honest
man
he
had
always
been
there
were
moments
when
he
recognised
this
primary
character
as
he
had
never
done
before
when
he
in
fact
quite
shook
in
his
shoes
at
the
idea
that
it
perhaps
had
in
reserve
some
supreme
assertion
of
its
identity
it
was
honest
verily
just
by
reason
of
the
possibility
it
was
poor
and
unsuccessful
because
here
it
was
just
on
the
verge
of
quarrelling
with
its
bread
and
butter
salvation
would
be
of
course
the
salvation
of
the
showman
rigidly
to
it
on
the
verge
not
to
let
it
in
other
words
overpass
by
an
inch
he
might
count
on
this
he
said
to
himself
if
there
were
any
public
if
there
were
thousands
of
people
demanding
of
him
what
he
was
paid
for
he
saw
the
approach
of
the
stage
at
which
they
would
affect
him
the
thousands
of
people
and
perhaps
even
more
the
earnest
individual
as
coming
really
to
see
if
he
were
earning
his
wage
he
soon
begin
to
fancy
them
in
league
with
the
body
practically
deputed
by
it
given
no
doubt
a
kindled
suspicion
to
look
in
and
report
observations
it
was
the
way
he
broke
down
with
the
lonely
pilgrim
that
led
to
his
first
broke
down
as
to
the
courage
required
for
damping
an
uncritical
faith
what
they
all
most
wanted
was
to
feel
that
everything
was
just
as
it
was
only
the
shock
of
having
to
part
with
that
vision
was
greater
than
any
individual
could
bear
unsupported
the
bad
moments
were
upstairs
in
the
birthroom
for
here
the
forces
pressing
on
the
very
edge
assumed
a
dire
intensity
the
mere
expression
of
eye
omnivorous
and
fairly
moistening
in
the
act
with
which
many
persons
gazed
about
might
eventually
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
remain
fairly
civil
often
they
came
in
pairs
sometimes
one
had
come
before
then
they
explained
to
each
other
he
in
that
case
never
corrected
he
listened
for
the
lesson
of
listening
after
which
he
would
remark
to
his
wife
that
there
was
no
end
to
what
he
was
learning
he
saw
that
if
he
should
really
ever
break
down
it
would
be
with
her
he
would
begin
he
had
given
her
hints
and
digs
enough
but
she
was
so
inflamed
with
appreciation
that
she
either
did
feel
them
or
pretended
not
to
understand
this
was
the
greater
complication
that
with
the
return
of
the
spring
and
the
increase
of
the
public
her
services
were
more
required
she
took
the
field
with
him
from
an
early
hour
she
was
present
with
the
party
above
while
he
kept
an
eye
and
still
more
an
ear
on
the
party
below
and
how
could
he
know
he
asked
himself
what
she
might
say
to
them
and
what
she
might
suffer
to
say
or
in
other
words
poor
wretches
to
believe
while
removed
from
his
control
some
day
or
other
and
before
too
long
he
could
but
think
he
must
have
the
matter
out
with
her
the
matter
namely
of
the
of
their
position
the
morality
of
women
was
special
he
was
getting
lights
on
that
isabel
conception
of
her
office
was
to
cherish
and
enrich
the
legend
it
was
already
the
legend
very
taking
but
what
was
she
there
for
but
to
make
it
more
so
she
certainly
was
there
to
chill
any
natural
piety
if
it
was
all
in
the
air
all
in
their
eye
as
the
vulgar
might
say
that
he
been
born
in
the
birthroom
where
was
the
value
of
the
sixpences
they
took
where
the
equivalent
they
had
engaged
to
supply
oh
dear
yes
just
about
and
she
must
tap
the
place
with
her
foot
altered
oh
dear
no
save
in
a
few
trifling
particulars
you
see
the
place
and
is
that
just
the
charm
of
it
quite
as
saw
it
very
poor
and
homely
no
doubt
but
just
what
so
wonderful
he
did
want
to
hear
her
and
yet
he
want
to
give
her
her
head
he
did
want
to
make
difficulties
or
to
snatch
the
bread
from
her
mouth
but
he
must
none
the
less
give
her
a
warning
before
they
had
gone
far
that
was
the
way
one
evening
in
june
he
put
it
to
her
the
affluence
with
the
finest
weather
having
lately
been
of
the
largest
and
the
crowd
all
day
fairly
gorged
with
the
story
we
must
you
know
go
far
the
odd
thing
was
that
she
had
now
ceased
even
to
be
conscious
of
what
troubled
him
she
was
so
launched
in
her
own
career
too
far
for
what
to
save
our
immortal
souls
we
must
love
tell
too
many
lies
she
looked
at
him
with
dire
reproach
ah
now
are
you
going
to
begin
again
i
never
begun
i
have
wanted
to
worry
you
but
you
know
we
do
know
anything
about
it
and
then
as
she
stared
flushing
about
his
having
been
born
up
there
about
anything
really
not
the
least
little
scrap
that
would
weigh
in
any
other
connexion
as
evidence
so
do
rub
it
in
so
rub
it
in
how
that
he
born
but
at
sight
of
her
face
he
only
sighed
oh
dear
oh
dear
do
you
think
she
replied
cuttingly
that
he
was
born
anywhere
he
hesitated
it
was
such
an
edifice
to
shake
well
we
do
know
there
very
little
know
he
covered
his
tracks
as
no
other
human
being
has
ever
done
she
was
still
in
her
public
costume
and
had
taken
off
the
gloves
she
made
a
point
of
wearing
as
a
part
of
that
uniform
she
remembered
how
the
rustling
housekeeper
in
the
border
castle
on
whom
she
had
begun
by
modelling
herself
had
worn
them
she
seemed
official
and
slightly
distant
to
cover
his
tracks
he
must
have
had
to
exist
have
we
got
to
give
up
no
i
do
ask
you
to
give
it
up
but
there
very
little
to
go
upon
and
is
that
what
i
to
tell
them
in
return
for
everything
gedge
waited
he
walked
about
the
place
was
doubly
still
after
the
bustle
of
the
day
and
the
summer
evening
rested
on
it
as
a
blessing
making
it
in
its
small
state
and
ancientry
mellow
and
sweet
it
was
good
to
be
there
and
it
would
be
good
to
stay
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
incalculable
in
the
effect
on
one
nerves
of
the
great
gregarious
density
this
was
an
attitude
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
degrees
and
shades
the
attitude
of
wanting
all
or
nothing
and
you
could
talk
things
over
with
it
you
could
only
do
that
with
friends
and
then
but
in
cases
where
you
were
sure
the
friends
would
betray
you
could
you
adopt
he
replied
at
last
a
slightly
more
discreet
method
what
we
can
say
is
that
things
have
been
that
all
we
have
to
do
with
is
this
really
when
they
jam
their
umbrellas
into
the
floor
very
where
he
was
born
it
has
from
a
long
time
back
been
described
as
being
could
one
meet
them
to
be
decent
a
little
in
some
such
way
as
that
she
looked
at
him
very
hard
is
that
the
way
meet
them
no
i
kept
on
lying
without
scruple
without
shame
then
why
do
you
haul
me
up
because
it
has
seemed
to
me
we
might
like
true
companions
work
it
out
a
little
together
this
was
not
strong
he
felt
as
pausing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
stood
before
her
and
he
knew
it
as
weaker
still
after
she
had
looked
at
him
a
minute
morris
gedge
i
propose
to
be
true
companion
and
i
come
here
to
stay
that
all
i
got
to
say
it
was
not
however
for
you
had
better
try
yourself
and
see
she
presently
added
give
the
place
give
the
story
away
by
so
much
as
a
look
and
well
i
allow
you
about
nine
days
then
you
see
he
feigned
to
gain
time
an
innocence
they
take
it
so
ill
and
then
as
she
said
nothing
they
turn
and
rend
me
they
tear
me
to
pieces
but
she
would
make
a
joke
of
it
they
would
it
simply
no
they
would
that
what
i
say
they
wo
you
had
better
she
went
on
begin
with
but
even
that
is
necessary
it
would
get
to
him
it
would
get
to
the
body
like
wildfire
i
see
said
poor
gedge
and
indeed
for
the
moment
he
did
see
while
his
companion
followed
up
what
she
believed
her
advantage
do
you
consider
it
a
fraud
well
i
grant
you
there
was
somebody
but
the
details
are
naught
the
links
are
missing
the
evidence
in
particular
about
that
room
upstairs
in
itself
our
casa
santa
is
it
was
so
awfully
long
ago
which
he
knew
again
sounded
weak
of
course
it
was
awfully
long
ago
that
just
the
beauty
and
the
interest
tell
them
them
she
continued
that
the
evidence
is
and
i
tell
them
something
else
she
spoke
it
with
such
meaning
that
his
face
seemed
to
show
a
question
to
which
she
was
on
the
spot
of
replying
i
tell
them
you
a
she
stopped
however
changing
it
i
tell
them
exactly
the
opposite
and
i
find
out
what
you
say
it
wo
take
long
to
do
it
if
we
tell
different
stories
possibly
may
save
us
i
see
what
you
mean
it
would
perhaps
as
an
oddity
have
a
success
of
curiosity
it
might
become
a
draw
still
they
but
want
broad
masses
and
he
looked
at
her
sadly
you
no
more
than
one
of
them
if
it
being
no
more
than
one
of
them
to
love
it
she
answered
then
i
certainly
am
and
i
not
ashamed
of
my
company
to
love
said
morris
gedge
to
love
to
think
he
was
born
there
you
think
too
much
it
bad
for
you
he
turned
away
with
his
chronic
moan
but
it
was
without
losing
what
she
called
after
him
i
decline
to
let
the
place
down
and
what
was
there
indeed
to
say
they
there
to
keep
it
up
v
he
kept
it
up
through
the
summer
but
with
the
queerest
consciousness
at
times
of
the
want
of
proportion
between
his
secret
rage
and
the
spirit
of
those
from
whom
the
friction
came
he
said
to
himself
so
sore
his
sensibility
had
grown
that
they
were
gregariously
ferocious
at
the
very
time
he
was
seeing
them
as
individually
mild
he
said
to
himself
that
they
were
mild
only
because
was
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
divinely
so
considering
what
he
might
be
and
that
he
should
as
his
wife
had
warned
him
soon
enough
have
news
of
it
were
he
to
deflect
by
a
hair
breadth
from
the
line
traced
for
him
was
the
collective
fatuity
that
it
was
capable
of
turning
on
the
instant
both
to
a
general
and
to
a
particular
resentment
since
the
least
breath
of
discrimination
would
get
him
the
sack
without
mercy
it
was
absurd
he
reflected
to
speak
of
his
discomfort
as
light
he
was
gagged
he
was
goaded
as
in
omnivorous
companies
he
doubtless
sometimes
showed
by
a
strange
silent
glare
they
get
him
the
sack
for
that
as
well
if
he
did
look
out
therefore
was
it
in
effect
ferocity
when
you
might
even
hold
your
tongue
they
would
let
you
off
with
silence
they
insisted
on
your
committing
yourself
it
was
the
pound
of
flesh
they
have
it
so
under
his
coat
he
bled
but
a
wondrous
peace
by
exception
dropped
on
him
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
august
the
pressure
had
as
usual
been
high
but
it
had
diminished
with
the
fall
of
day
and
the
place
was
empty
before
the
hour
for
closing
then
it
was
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
this
hour
there
presented
themselves
a
pair
of
pilgrims
to
whom
in
the
ordinary
course
he
would
have
remarked
that
they
were
to
his
regret
too
late
he
was
to
wonder
afterwards
why
the
course
had
at
sight
of
the
visitors
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
appealing
and
fairly
young
shown
for
him
as
other
than
ordinary
the
consequence
sprang
doubtless
from
something
rather
fine
and
unnameable
something
for
example
in
the
tone
of
the
young
man
or
in
the
light
of
his
eye
after
hearing
the
statement
on
the
subject
of
the
hour
yes
we
know
it
late
but
it
just
i
afraid
of
that
we
had
rather
a
notion
of
escaping
the
crowd
as
i
suppose
you
mostly
have
one
now
and
it
was
really
on
the
chance
of
finding
you
alone
these
things
the
young
man
said
before
being
quite
admitted
and
they
were
words
any
one
might
have
spoken
who
had
taken
the
trouble
to
be
punctual
or
who
desired
a
little
ingratiatingly
to
force
the
door
gedge
even
guessed
at
the
sense
that
might
lurk
in
them
the
hint
of
a
special
tip
if
the
point
were
stretched
there
were
no
tips
he
had
often
thanked
his
stars
at
the
birthplace
there
was
the
charged
fee
and
nothing
more
everything
else
was
out
of
order
to
the
relief
of
a
palm
not
formed
by
nature
as
a
scoop
yet
in
spite
of
everything
in
spite
especially
of
the
almost
audible
chink
of
the
gentleman
sovereigns
which
might
in
another
case
exactly
have
put
him
out
he
presently
found
himself
in
the
birthroom
access
to
which
he
had
gracefully
enough
granted
almost
treating
the
visit
as
personal
and
private
the
reason
well
the
reason
would
have
been
if
anywhere
in
something
naturally
persuasive
on
the
part
of
the
couple
unless
it
had
been
rather
again
in
the
way
the
young
man
once
he
was
in
the
place
met
the
caretaker
expression
of
face
held
it
a
moment
and
seemed
to
wish
to
sound
it
that
they
were
americans
was
promptly
clear
and
gedge
could
very
nearly
have
told
what
kind
he
had
arrived
at
the
point
of
distinguishing
kinds
though
the
difficulty
might
have
been
with
him
now
that
the
case
before
him
was
rare
he
saw
it
suddenly
in
the
light
of
the
golden
midland
evening
which
reached
them
through
low
old
windows
saw
it
with
a
rush
of
feeling
unexpected
and
smothered
that
made
him
a
moment
wish
to
keep
it
before
him
as
a
case
of
inordinate
happiness
it
made
him
feel
old
shabby
poor
but
he
watched
it
no
less
intensely
for
its
doing
so
they
were
children
of
fortune
of
the
greatest
as
it
might
seem
to
morris
gedge
and
they
were
of
course
lately
married
the
husband
and
soft
but
resolute
and
fine
several
years
older
than
the
wife
and
the
wife
vaguely
delicately
irregularly
but
mercilessly
pretty
some
how
the
world
was
theirs
they
gave
the
person
who
took
the
sixpences
at
the
birthplace
such
a
sense
of
the
high
luxury
of
freedom
as
he
had
never
had
the
thing
was
that
the
world
was
theirs
not
simply
because
they
had
money
he
had
seen
rich
people
enough
but
because
they
could
in
a
supreme
degree
think
and
feel
and
say
what
they
liked
they
had
a
nature
and
a
culture
a
tradition
a
facility
of
some
sort
and
all
producing
in
them
an
effect
of
positive
beauty
that
gave
a
light
to
their
liberty
and
an
ease
to
their
tone
these
things
moreover
suffered
nothing
from
the
fact
that
they
happened
to
be
in
mourning
this
was
probably
worn
for
some
opulent
father
if
not
some
delicate
mother
who
would
be
sure
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
source
of
the
beauty
and
it
affected
gedge
in
the
gathered
twilight
and
at
his
odd
crisis
as
the
very
uniform
of
their
distinction
he
could
quite
have
said
afterwards
by
what
steps
the
point
had
been
reached
but
it
had
become
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
a
part
of
their
presence
in
the
birthroom
a
part
of
the
young
man
look
a
part
of
the
charm
of
the
moment
and
a
part
above
all
of
a
strange
sense
within
him
of
now
or
never
that
gedge
had
suddenly
thrillingly
let
himself
go
he
had
been
definitely
conscious
of
drifting
to
it
he
had
been
for
that
too
conscious
merely
of
thinking
how
different
in
all
their
range
were
such
a
united
couple
from
another
united
couple
known
to
him
they
were
everything
he
and
his
wife
were
this
was
more
than
anything
else
the
first
lesson
of
their
talk
thousands
of
couples
of
whom
the
same
was
true
certainly
had
passed
before
him
but
none
of
whom
it
was
true
with
just
that
engaging
intensity
and
just
of
their
transcendent
freedom
that
was
what
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
saw
it
all
come
back
to
the
husband
who
had
been
there
at
some
earlier
time
had
his
impression
which
he
wished
now
to
make
his
wife
share
but
he
already
gedge
could
see
had
concealed
it
from
her
a
pleasant
irony
in
fine
our
friend
seemed
to
taste
in
the
air
he
who
had
yet
felt
free
to
taste
his
own
i
think
you
were
here
four
years
ago
that
was
what
the
young
man
had
almost
begun
by
remarking
gedge
liked
his
remembering
it
liked
his
frankly
speaking
to
him
all
the
more
that
he
had
offered
as
it
were
no
opening
he
had
let
them
look
about
below
and
then
had
taken
them
up
but
without
words
without
the
usual
showman
song
of
which
he
would
have
been
afraid
the
visitors
did
ask
for
it
the
young
man
had
taken
the
matter
out
of
his
hands
by
himself
dropping
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
woman
a
few
detached
remarks
what
gedge
oddly
felt
was
that
these
remarks
were
not
inconsiderate
of
him
he
had
heard
others
both
of
the
priggish
order
and
the
crude
that
might
have
been
called
so
and
as
the
young
man
had
been
aided
to
this
cognition
of
him
as
new
it
already
began
to
make
for
them
a
certain
common
ground
the
ground
became
immense
when
the
visitor
presently
added
with
a
smile
there
was
a
good
lady
i
recollect
who
had
a
great
deal
to
say
it
was
the
gentleman
smile
that
had
done
it
the
irony
there
ah
there
has
been
a
great
deal
said
and
gedge
look
at
his
interlocutor
doubtless
showed
his
sense
of
being
sounded
it
was
extraordinary
of
course
that
a
perfect
stranger
should
have
guessed
the
travail
of
his
spirit
should
have
caught
the
gleam
of
his
inner
commentary
that
probably
leaked
in
spite
of
him
out
of
his
poor
old
eyes
much
of
it
in
such
places
as
this
he
heard
himself
adding
is
of
course
said
very
irresponsibly
places
as
this
he
winced
at
the
words
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
them
there
was
no
wincing
however
on
the
part
of
his
pleasant
companions
exactly
so
the
whole
thing
becomes
a
sort
of
stiff
smug
convention
like
a
sacred
doll
in
a
spanish
church
which
you
a
monster
if
you
touch
a
monster
gedge
assented
meeting
his
eyes
the
young
man
smiled
but
he
thought
looking
at
him
a
little
harder
a
blasphemer
a
blasphemer
it
seemed
to
do
his
visitor
good
he
certainly
looking
at
him
harder
detached
as
he
was
he
was
interested
he
was
at
least
amused
then
you
do
claim
or
at
any
rate
do
insist
i
mean
you
personally
he
had
an
identity
for
him
gedge
felt
that
he
could
have
had
for
a
briton
and
the
impulse
was
quick
in
our
friend
to
testify
to
this
perception
i
do
insist
to
the
young
man
laughed
it
really
i
assure
you
if
i
may
would
do
any
good
i
too
awfully
interested
do
you
mean
his
wife
lightly
inquired
in
a
pulling
it
down
rather
in
what
you
said
to
me
has
he
said
to
you
gedge
intervened
though
quaking
a
little
that
he
would
like
to
pull
it
down
she
met
in
her
free
sweetness
this
appeal
with
such
a
charm
oh
perhaps
not
quite
the
good
you
see
we
live
on
it
i
mean
people
the
husband
had
laughed
but
had
now
so
completely
ceased
to
look
about
him
that
there
seemed
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
talk
avowedly
with
the
caretaker
i
interested
he
explained
in
what
i
think
interesting
thing
or
at
all
events
the
eternally
tormenting
one
the
fact
of
the
abysmally
little
that
in
proportion
we
know
in
proportion
to
what
his
companion
asked
well
to
what
there
must
have
been
to
what
in
fact
there
to
wonder
about
that
the
interest
it
immense
he
escapes
us
like
a
thief
at
night
carrying
off
well
carrying
off
everything
and
people
pretend
to
catch
him
like
a
flown
canary
over
whom
you
can
close
your
hand
and
put
him
back
in
the
cage
he
wo
back
he
wo
back
not
the
young
man
laughed
such
a
fool
it
makes
him
the
happiest
of
all
great
men
he
had
begun
by
speaking
to
his
wife
but
had
ended
with
his
friendly
his
easy
his
indescribable
competence
for
gedge
poor
gedge
who
quite
held
his
breath
and
who
felt
in
the
most
unexpected
way
that
he
had
somehow
never
been
in
such
good
society
the
young
wife
who
for
herself
meanwhile
had
continued
to
look
about
sighed
out
smiled
out
gedge
could
have
told
which
her
little
answer
to
these
remarks
it
rather
a
pity
you
know
that
he
here
i
mean
as
goethe
at
weimar
for
goethe
at
weimar
yes
my
dear
that
goethe
bad
luck
there
he
sticks
man
anywhere
i
defy
you
to
catch
him
why
not
say
beautifully
the
young
woman
laughed
that
like
the
wind
he
everywhere
it
was
of
course
the
tone
of
discussion
it
was
the
tone
of
pleasantry
though
of
better
pleasantry
gedge
seemed
to
feel
and
more
within
his
own
appreciation
than
he
had
ever
listened
to
and
this
was
precisely
why
the
young
man
could
go
on
without
the
effect
of
irritation
answering
his
wife
but
still
with
eyes
for
their
companion
i
be
hanged
if
he
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
taken
that
is
struck
and
rather
held
by
their
companion
unruffled
state
which
they
had
meant
to
ruffle
but
which
suddenly
presented
its
interest
perhaps
even
projected
its
light
the
gentleman
did
know
gedge
was
afterwards
to
say
to
himself
how
that
hypocrite
was
inwardly
all
of
a
tremble
how
it
seemed
to
him
his
fate
was
being
literally
pulled
down
on
his
head
he
was
trembling
for
the
moment
certainly
too
much
to
speak
abject
he
might
be
but
he
did
want
his
voice
to
have
the
absurdity
of
a
quaver
and
the
young
woman
charming
creature
still
had
another
word
it
was
for
the
guardian
of
the
spot
and
she
made
it
in
her
way
delightful
they
had
remained
in
the
holy
of
holies
where
she
had
been
looking
for
a
minute
with
a
ruefulness
just
marked
enough
to
be
pretty
at
the
queer
old
floor
then
if
you
say
it
in
this
room
he
was
born
well
what
the
use
what
the
use
of
what
her
husband
asked
the
use
you
mean
of
our
coming
here
why
the
place
is
charming
in
itself
and
it
also
interesting
he
added
to
gedge
to
know
how
you
get
on
gedge
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
but
answering
the
young
woman
first
if
poor
isabel
he
was
thinking
could
only
have
been
like
that
not
as
to
youth
beauty
arrangement
of
hair
or
picturesque
grace
of
hat
these
things
he
did
mind
but
as
to
sympathy
facility
light
perceptive
and
yet
not
cheap
detachment
i
do
say
it
was
but
i
do
say
it
ah
but
does
that
she
returned
come
very
much
to
the
same
thing
and
do
they
want
also
to
see
where
he
had
his
dinner
and
where
he
had
his
tea
they
want
everything
said
morris
gedge
they
want
to
see
where
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
where
he
kept
his
boots
and
where
his
mother
boiled
her
pot
but
if
you
do
show
them
they
show
it
in
all
their
little
books
you
mean
the
husband
asked
that
you
only
to
hold
your
tongue
i
try
to
said
gedge
well
his
visitor
smiled
i
see
you
gedge
hesitated
i
ca
oh
well
said
his
friend
what
does
it
matter
i
do
speak
he
continued
i
ca
sometimes
not
then
how
do
you
get
on
gedge
looked
at
him
more
abjectly
to
his
own
sense
than
ever
at
any
one
even
at
isabel
when
she
frightened
him
i
do
get
on
i
speak
he
said
since
i
spoken
to
oh
sha
hurt
you
the
young
man
reassuringly
laughed
the
twilight
meanwhile
had
sensibly
thickened
the
end
of
the
visit
was
indicated
they
turned
together
out
of
the
upper
room
and
came
down
the
narrow
stair
the
words
just
exchanged
might
have
been
felt
as
producing
an
awkwardness
which
the
young
woman
gracefully
felt
the
impulse
to
dissipate
you
must
rather
wonder
why
we
come
and
it
was
the
first
note
for
gedge
of
a
further
awkwardness
as
if
he
had
definitely
heard
it
make
the
husband
hand
in
a
full
pocket
begin
to
fumble
it
was
even
a
little
awkwardly
that
the
husband
still
held
off
oh
we
like
it
as
it
is
there
always
with
which
they
had
approached
the
door
of
egress
what
is
there
please
asked
morris
gedge
not
yet
opening
the
door
since
he
would
fain
have
kept
the
pair
on
and
conscious
only
for
a
moment
after
he
had
spoken
that
his
question
was
just
having
for
the
young
man
too
dreadfully
wrong
a
sound
this
personage
wondered
yet
feared
and
had
evidently
for
some
minutes
been
putting
himself
a
question
so
that
with
his
preoccupation
the
caretaker
words
had
represented
to
him
inevitably
what
is
there
please
for
gedge
already
knew
with
it
moreover
that
he
was
stopping
him
in
time
he
had
uttered
that
challenge
to
show
he
himself
was
afraid
and
he
must
have
had
in
consequence
he
was
subsequently
to
reflect
a
lamentable
air
of
waiting
the
visitor
hand
came
out
i
hope
i
may
take
the
liberty
what
afterwards
happened
our
friend
scarcely
knew
for
it
fell
into
a
slight
confusion
the
confusion
of
a
queer
gleam
of
gold
a
sovereign
fairly
thrust
at
him
of
a
quick
almost
violent
motion
on
his
own
part
which
to
make
the
matter
worse
might
well
have
sent
the
money
roiling
on
the
floor
and
then
of
marked
blushes
all
round
and
a
sensible
embarrassment
producing
indeed
in
turn
rather
oddly
and
ever
so
quickly
an
increase
of
communion
it
was
as
if
the
young
man
had
offered
him
money
to
make
up
to
him
for
having
as
it
were
led
him
on
and
then
perceiving
the
mistake
but
liking
him
the
better
for
his
refusal
had
wanted
to
obliterate
this
aggravation
of
his
original
wrong
he
had
done
so
presently
while
gedge
got
the
door
open
by
saying
the
best
thing
he
could
and
by
saying
it
frankly
and
gaily
luckily
it
does
at
all
affect
the
the
small
quiet
and
empty
in
the
summer
eventide
stretched
to
right
and
left
with
a
gabled
and
timbered
house
or
two
and
fairly
seemed
to
have
cleared
itself
to
congruity
with
the
historic
void
over
which
our
friends
lingering
an
instant
to
converse
looked
at
each
other
the
young
wife
rather
looked
about
a
moment
at
all
there
was
to
be
seen
and
then
before
gedge
had
found
a
reply
to
her
husband
remark
uttered
evidently
in
the
interest
of
conciliation
a
little
question
of
her
own
that
she
tried
to
make
earnest
it
our
unfortunate
ignorance
you
mean
that
does
unfortunate
or
fortunate
i
like
it
so
said
the
husband
the
thing
let
the
author
alone
gedge
with
his
key
on
his
forefinger
leaned
against
the
took
in
the
stupid
little
street
and
was
sorry
to
see
them
go
they
seemed
so
to
abandon
him
that
just
what
they
wo
do
nor
let
do
it
all
i
want
to
let
the
author
alone
practically
he
felt
himself
getting
the
last
of
his
chance
there
is
no
author
that
is
for
us
to
deal
with
there
are
all
the
immortal
people
the
work
but
there
nobody
else
yes
said
the
young
man
that
what
it
comes
to
there
should
really
to
clear
the
matter
up
be
no
such
person
as
you
say
gedge
returned
it
what
it
comes
to
there
no
such
person
the
evening
air
listened
in
the
warm
thick
midland
stillness
while
the
wife
little
cry
rang
out
but
there
there
was
somebody
said
gedge
against
the
but
they
killed
him
and
dead
as
he
is
they
keep
it
up
they
do
it
over
again
they
kill
him
every
day
he
was
aware
of
saying
this
so
grimly
more
than
he
wished
that
his
companions
exchanged
a
glance
and
even
perhaps
looked
as
if
they
felt
him
extravagant
that
was
really
the
way
isabel
had
warned
him
all
the
others
would
be
looking
if
he
should
talk
to
them
as
he
talked
to
he
liked
however
for
that
matter
to
hear
how
he
should
sound
when
pronounced
incapable
through
deterioration
of
the
brain
then
if
there
no
author
if
there
nothing
to
be
said
but
that
there
is
anybody
the
young
woman
smilingly
asked
why
in
the
world
should
there
be
a
house
there
should
said
morris
gedge
decidedly
yes
he
affected
the
young
man
oh
i
do
say
mind
you
that
you
should
pull
it
down
then
where
would
you
their
companion
sweetly
inquired
that
what
my
wife
asks
gedge
returned
then
keep
it
up
keep
it
up
and
the
husband
held
out
his
hand
that
what
my
wife
says
gedge
went
on
as
he
shook
it
the
young
woman
charming
creature
emulated
the
other
visitor
she
offered
their
remarkable
friend
her
handshake
then
mind
your
wife
the
poor
man
faced
her
gravely
i
would
if
she
were
such
a
wife
as
you
vi
it
had
made
for
him
all
the
same
an
immense
difference
it
had
given
him
an
extraordinary
lift
so
that
a
certain
sweet
aftertaste
of
his
freedom
might
a
couple
of
months
later
have
been
suspected
of
aiding
to
produce
for
him
another
and
really
a
more
considerable
adventure
it
was
an
absurd
way
to
reason
but
he
had
been
to
his
imagination
for
twenty
minutes
in
good
society
that
being
the
term
that
best
described
for
him
the
company
of
people
to
whom
he
had
to
talk
as
he
phrased
it
rot
it
was
his
title
to
good
society
that
he
had
in
his
doubtless
awkward
way
affirmed
and
the
difficulty
was
just
that
having
affirmed
it
he
could
take
back
the
affirmation
few
things
had
happened
to
him
in
life
that
is
few
that
were
agreeable
but
at
least
had
and
he
was
so
constructed
that
he
could
go
on
as
if
it
had
it
was
going
on
as
if
it
had
however
that
landed
him
alas
in
the
situation
unmistakably
marked
by
a
visit
from
late
one
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
october
this
had
been
the
hour
of
the
call
of
the
young
americans
every
day
that
hour
had
come
round
something
of
the
deep
throb
of
it
the
successful
secret
woke
up
but
the
two
occasions
were
of
a
truth
related
only
by
being
so
intensely
opposed
the
secret
had
been
successful
in
that
he
had
said
nothing
of
it
to
isabel
who
occupied
in
their
own
quarter
while
the
incident
lasted
had
neither
heard
the
visitors
arrive
nor
seen
them
depart
it
was
on
the
other
hand
scarcely
successful
in
guarding
itself
from
indirect
betrayals
there
were
two
persons
in
the
world
at
least
who
felt
as
he
did
they
were
persons
also
who
had
treated
him
benignly
as
feeling
after
style
who
had
been
ready
in
fact
to
overflow
in
gifts
as
a
sign
of
it
and
though
they
were
now
off
in
space
they
were
still
with
him
sufficiently
in
spirit
to
make
him
play
as
it
were
with
the
sense
of
their
sympathy
this
in
turn
made
him
as
he
was
perfectly
aware
more
than
a
shade
or
two
reckless
so
that
in
his
reaction
from
that
gluttony
of
the
public
for
false
facts
which
had
from
the
first
tormented
him
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
sailing
as
he
would
have
said
too
near
the
wind
or
in
other
words
all
in
presence
of
the
people
of
washing
his
hands
of
the
legend
he
had
crossed
the
line
he
knew
it
he
had
struck
wild
they
drove
him
to
it
he
had
substituted
by
a
succession
of
uncontrollable
profanities
an
attitude
that
could
be
understood
for
an
attitude
that
but
too
evidently
been
this
was
of
course
the
franker
line
only
he
had
taken
it
alas
for
frankness
had
in
the
least
really
adopted
it
at
all
but
had
been
simply
himself
caught
up
and
disposed
of
by
it
hurled
by
his
fate
against
the
bedizened
walls
of
the
temple
quite
in
the
way
of
a
priest
possessed
to
excess
of
the
god
or
more
vulgarly
that
of
a
blind
bull
in
a
an
animal
to
which
he
often
compared
himself
he
had
let
himself
fatally
go
in
fine
just
for
irritation
for
rage
having
in
his
predicament
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
frankness
a
luxury
reserved
for
quite
other
situations
it
had
always
been
his
view
that
one
lived
to
learn
he
had
learned
something
every
hour
of
his
life
though
people
mostly
never
knew
what
in
spite
of
its
having
generally
been
it
at
somebody
expense
what
he
was
at
present
continually
learning
was
the
sense
of
a
form
of
words
heretofore
so
vain
the
famous
false
position
that
had
so
often
helped
out
a
phrase
one
used
names
in
that
way
without
knowing
what
they
were
worth
then
of
a
sudden
one
fine
day
their
meaning
grew
bitter
in
the
mouth
this
was
a
truth
with
the
relish
of
which
his
fireside
hours
were
occupied
and
he
was
aware
of
how
much
it
exposed
a
man
to
look
so
perpetually
as
if
something
had
disagreed
with
him
the
look
to
be
worn
at
the
birthplace
was
properly
the
beatific
and
when
once
it
had
fairly
been
missed
by
those
who
took
it
for
granted
who
indeed
paid
sixpence
for
it
like
the
in
provincial
france
it
was
one
would
be
sure
to
have
news
of
the
remark
news
accordingly
was
what
gedge
had
been
expecting
and
what
he
knew
above
all
had
been
expected
by
his
wife
who
had
a
way
of
sitting
at
present
as
with
an
ear
for
a
certain
knock
she
did
watch
him
did
follow
him
about
the
house
at
the
public
hours
to
spy
upon
his
treachery
and
that
could
touch
him
even
though
her
averted
eyes
went
through
him
more
than
her
fixed
her
mistrust
was
so
perfectly
expressed
by
her
manner
of
showing
she
trusted
that
he
never
felt
so
nervous
never
tried
so
to
keep
straight
as
when
she
most
let
him
alone
when
the
crowd
thickened
and
they
had
of
necessity
to
receive
together
he
tried
himself
to
get
off
by
allowing
her
as
much
as
possible
the
word
when
people
appealed
to
him
he
turned
to
her
and
with
more
of
ceremony
than
their
relation
warranted
he
help
either
if
it
seemed
ironic
as
to
the
person
most
concerned
or
most
competent
he
flattered
himself
at
these
moments
that
no
one
would
have
guessed
her
being
his
wife
especially
as
to
do
her
justice
she
met
his
manner
with
a
wonderful
grim
bravado
grim
so
to
say
for
himself
grim
by
its
outrageous
cheerfulness
for
the
the
lore
she
produce
for
them
the
associations
of
the
sacred
spot
she
developed
multiplied
embroidered
the
things
in
short
she
said
and
the
stupendous
way
she
said
them
she
was
a
bit
ashamed
since
why
need
virtue
be
ever
ashamed
it
was
virtue
for
it
put
bread
into
his
mouth
he
meanwhile
on
his
side
taking
it
out
of
hers
he
had
seen
on
the
october
day
in
the
birthplace
itself
the
right
setting
of
course
for
such
an
interview
and
what
had
occurred
was
that
precisely
when
the
scene
had
ended
and
he
had
come
back
to
their
own
the
question
she
put
to
him
for
information
was
have
you
settled
it
that
i
to
starve
she
had
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
to
him
so
straight
which
was
but
a
proof
of
her
real
anxiety
the
straightness
of
visit
following
on
the
very
slight
sinuosity
of
a
note
shortly
before
received
from
him
made
tension
show
for
what
it
was
by
this
time
really
however
his
decision
had
been
taken
the
minutes
elapsing
between
his
reappearance
at
the
domestic
fireside
and
his
having
from
the
other
threshold
seen
broad
back
the
back
of
a
banker
and
a
patriot
move
away
had
though
few
presented
themselves
to
him
as
supremely
critical
they
formed
as
it
were
the
hinge
of
his
door
that
door
actually
ajar
so
as
to
show
him
a
possible
fate
beyond
it
but
which
with
his
hand
in
a
spasm
thus
tightening
on
the
knob
he
might
either
open
wide
or
close
partly
or
altogether
he
stood
at
autumn
dusk
in
the
little
museum
that
constituted
the
vestibule
of
the
temple
and
there
as
with
a
concentrated
push
at
the
crank
of
a
windlass
he
brought
himself
round
the
portraits
on
the
walls
seemed
vaguely
to
watch
for
it
it
was
in
their
august
presence
kept
dimly
august
for
the
moment
by
impressive
check
of
his
application
of
a
match
to
the
vulgar
gas
that
the
great
man
had
uttered
as
if
it
said
all
his
you
know
my
dear
fellow
really
he
had
managed
it
with
the
special
tact
of
a
fat
man
always
when
there
any
very
fine
he
had
got
the
most
out
of
the
time
the
place
the
setting
all
the
little
massed
admonitions
and
symbols
confronted
there
with
his
victim
on
the
spot
that
he
took
occasion
to
name
afresh
as
to
piety
and
patriotism
the
most
sacred
on
earth
he
had
given
it
to
be
understood
that
in
the
first
place
he
was
lost
in
amazement
and
that
in
the
second
he
expected
a
single
warning
now
to
suffice
not
to
insist
too
much
moreover
on
the
question
of
gratitude
he
would
let
his
remonstrance
rest
if
need
be
solely
on
the
question
of
taste
a
matter
of
taste
alone
but
he
was
surely
not
to
be
obliged
to
follow
that
up
poor
gedge
indeed
would
have
been
sorry
to
oblige
him
for
he
saw
it
was
exactly
to
the
atrocious
taste
of
unthankfulness
the
allusion
was
made
when
he
said
he
would
dwell
on
what
the
fortunate
occupant
of
the
post
owed
him
for
the
stout
battle
originally
fought
on
his
behalf
he
simply
meant
he
that
was
his
tact
which
with
everything
else
that
has
been
mentioned
in
the
scene
to
help
really
had
the
ground
to
itself
the
day
been
when
gedge
could
have
thanked
him
enough
though
he
had
thanked
him
he
considered
almost
fulsomely
and
nothing
nothing
that
he
could
coherently
or
reputably
name
had
happened
since
then
from
the
moment
he
was
pulled
up
in
short
he
had
no
case
and
if
he
exhibited
instead
of
one
only
hot
tears
in
his
eyes
the
mystic
gloom
of
the
temple
either
prevented
his
friend
from
seeing
them
or
rendered
it
possible
that
they
stood
for
remorse
he
had
dried
them
with
the
pads
formed
by
the
base
of
his
bony
thumbs
before
he
went
in
to
isabel
this
was
the
more
fortunate
as
in
spite
of
her
inquiry
prompt
and
pointed
he
but
moved
about
the
room
looking
at
her
hard
then
he
stood
before
the
fire
a
little
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
divided
quite
as
the
person
in
permanent
possession
it
was
an
indication
his
wife
appeared
to
take
in
but
she
put
nevertheless
presently
another
question
you
object
to
telling
me
what
he
said
he
said
know
my
dear
fellow
really
and
is
that
all
practically
except
that
i
a
thankless
beast
well
she
responded
not
with
dissent
you
mean
that
i
are
those
the
words
he
used
she
asked
with
a
scruple
gedge
continued
to
think
the
words
he
used
were
that
i
give
away
the
show
and
that
from
several
sources
it
has
come
round
to
them
as
of
course
a
baby
would
have
known
and
then
as
her
husband
said
nothing
were
the
words
he
used
absolutely
he
could
have
used
better
ones
did
he
call
it
gedge
inquired
the
of
course
he
did
the
biggest
on
earth
she
winced
looking
at
him
hard
she
wondered
but
only
for
a
moment
well
it
then
it
something
gedge
went
on
to
have
given
away
but
he
added
i
taken
it
back
you
mean
you
been
convinced
i
mean
i
been
scared
at
last
at
last
she
gratefully
breathed
oh
it
was
easily
done
it
was
only
two
words
but
here
i
am
her
face
was
now
less
hard
for
him
and
what
two
words
know
gedge
that
it
simply
wo
do
that
was
all
but
it
was
the
way
such
a
man
says
them
i
glad
then
gedge
frankly
averred
that
he
such
a
man
how
did
you
ever
think
it
do
well
it
was
my
critical
sense
i
did
ever
know
i
had
one
till
they
came
and
by
putting
me
here
waked
it
up
in
me
then
i
had
somehow
you
see
to
live
with
it
and
i
seemed
to
feel
that
with
one
thing
and
another
giving
it
time
and
in
the
long
run
it
might
it
to
come
out
on
top
of
the
heap
now
that
where
he
says
it
simply
wo
so
i
must
put
it
i
put
it
at
the
bottom
a
very
good
place
then
for
a
critical
sense
and
isabel
more
placidly
now
folded
her
work
that
is
you
can
only
keep
it
there
if
it
does
struggle
up
again
it
ca
struggle
he
was
still
before
the
fire
looking
round
at
the
warm
low
room
peaceful
in
the
lamplight
with
the
hum
of
the
kettle
for
the
ear
with
the
curtain
drawn
over
the
leaded
casement
a
short
moreen
curtain
artfully
chosen
by
isabel
for
the
effect
of
the
olden
time
its
virtue
of
letting
the
light
within
show
ruddy
to
the
street
it
dead
he
went
on
i
killed
it
just
now
he
really
spoke
so
that
she
wondered
just
now
there
in
the
other
place
i
strangled
it
poor
thing
in
the
dark
if
you
go
out
and
see
there
must
be
blood
which
indeed
he
added
on
an
altar
of
sacrifice
is
all
right
but
the
place
is
for
ever
spattered
i
do
want
to
go
out
and
see
she
locked
her
hands
over
the
needlework
folded
on
her
knee
and
he
knew
with
her
eyes
on
him
that
a
look
he
had
seen
before
was
in
her
face
you
off
your
head
you
know
my
dear
in
a
way
then
however
more
cheeringly
it
a
good
job
it
has
been
too
late
too
late
to
get
it
under
too
late
for
them
to
give
you
the
second
chance
that
i
thank
god
you
accept
yes
if
it
been
and
he
looked
away
as
through
the
ruddy
curtain
and
into
the
chill
street
then
he
faced
her
again
i
scarcely
got
over
my
fright
yet
i
mean
he
went
on
for
you
and
i
mean
for
suppose
what
you
had
come
to
announce
to
me
now
were
that
we
had
the
sack
how
should
i
enjoy
do
you
think
seeing
you
turn
out
yes
out
she
added
as
his
eyes
again
moved
from
their
little
warm
circle
to
the
night
of
early
winter
on
the
other
side
of
the
pane
to
the
rare
quick
footsteps
to
the
closed
doors
to
the
curtains
drawn
like
their
own
behind
which
the
small
flat
town
intrinsically
dull
was
sitting
down
to
supper
he
stiffened
himself
as
he
warmed
his
back
he
held
up
his
head
shaking
himself
a
little
as
if
to
shake
the
stoop
out
of
his
shoulders
but
he
had
to
allow
she
was
right
what
would
have
become
of
us
what
indeed
we
should
have
begged
our
bread
or
i
should
be
taking
in
washing
he
was
silent
a
little
i
too
old
i
should
have
begun
sooner
oh
god
forbid
she
cried
the
pinch
he
pursued
is
that
i
can
do
nothing
else
nothing
whatever
she
agreed
with
elation
whereas
here
if
i
cultivate
it
i
perhaps
still
lie
but
i
must
cultivate
it
oh
you
old
dear
and
she
got
up
to
kiss
him
i
do
my
best
he
said
vii
do
you
remember
us
the
gentleman
asked
and
smiled
with
the
lady
beside
him
smiling
too
speaking
so
much
less
as
an
earnest
pilgrim
or
as
a
tiresome
tourist
than
as
an
old
acquaintance
it
was
history
repeating
itself
as
gedge
had
somehow
never
expected
with
almost
everything
the
same
except
that
the
evening
was
now
a
mild
except
that
the
visitors
had
put
off
mourning
and
showed
all
their
bravery
besides
showing
as
he
doubtless
did
himself
though
so
differently
for
a
little
older
except
above
all
that
oh
seeing
them
again
suddenly
affected
him
not
a
bit
as
the
thing
he
have
supposed
it
we
in
england
again
and
we
were
near
i
a
brother
at
oxford
with
whom
we
been
spending
a
day
so
that
we
thought
we
come
over
this
the
young
man
pleasantly
said
while
our
friend
took
in
the
queer
fact
that
he
must
himself
seem
to
them
rather
coldly
to
gape
they
had
come
in
the
same
way
at
the
quiet
close
another
august
had
passed
and
this
was
the
second
spring
the
birthplace
given
the
hour
was
about
to
suspend
operations
till
the
morrow
the
last
lingerer
had
gone
and
the
fancy
of
the
visitors
was
once
more
for
a
look
round
by
themselves
this
represented
surely
no
greater
presumption
than
the
terms
on
which
they
had
last
parted
with
him
seemed
to
warrant
so
that
if
he
did
inconsequently
stare
it
was
just
in
fact
because
he
was
so
supremely
far
from
having
forgotten
them
but
the
sight
of
the
pair
luckily
had
a
double
effect
and
the
first
precipitated
the
second
the
second
being
really
his
sudden
vision
that
everything
perhaps
depended
for
him
on
his
recognising
no
complication
he
must
go
straight
on
since
it
was
what
had
for
more
than
a
year
now
so
handsomely
answered
he
must
brazen
it
out
consistently
since
that
only
was
what
his
dignity
was
at
last
reduced
to
he
must
be
afraid
in
one
way
any
more
than
he
had
been
in
another
besides
which
it
came
over
him
to
the
point
of
his
flushing
for
it
that
their
visit
in
its
essence
must
have
been
for
himself
it
was
good
society
again
and
were
the
same
it
was
for
him
therefore
to
behave
as
if
he
could
meet
them
these
deep
vibrations
on
gedge
part
were
as
quick
as
they
were
deep
they
came
in
fact
all
at
once
so
that
his
response
his
declaration
that
it
was
all
right
oh
the
hour
does
matter
for
had
hung
fire
but
an
instant
and
when
they
were
well
across
the
threshold
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
housed
in
the
twilight
of
the
temple
where
as
before
the
votive
offerings
glimmered
on
the
walls
he
drew
the
long
breath
of
one
who
might
by
a
have
done
something
too
dreadful
for
what
had
brought
them
back
was
indubitably
not
the
glamour
of
the
shrine
itself
since
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
their
analysis
of
that
quantity
but
their
critical
not
to
say
their
sentimental
interest
in
the
queer
case
of
the
priest
their
call
was
the
tribute
of
curiosity
of
sympathy
of
a
compassion
really
as
such
things
went
exquisite
a
tribute
that
queerness
which
entitled
them
to
the
frankest
welcome
they
had
wanted
for
the
generous
wonder
of
it
to
judge
how
he
was
getting
on
how
such
a
man
in
such
a
place
and
they
had
doubtless
more
than
to
see
the
door
opened
by
somebody
who
had
succeeded
him
well
somebody
only
with
a
strange
equivocation
as
they
would
have
poor
things
to
make
out
themselves
an
embarrassment
for
which
he
pitied
them
nothing
could
have
been
more
odd
but
verily
it
was
this
troubled
vision
of
their
possible
bewilderment
and
this
compunctious
view
of
such
a
return
for
their
amenity
that
practically
determined
in
him
his
tone
the
lapse
of
the
months
had
but
made
their
name
familiar
to
him
they
had
on
the
other
occasion
inscribed
it
among
the
thousand
names
in
the
current
public
register
and
he
had
since
then
for
reasons
of
his
own
reasons
of
feeling
again
and
again
turned
back
to
it
it
was
nothing
in
itself
it
told
him
nothing
and
hayes
new
york
one
of
those
american
labels
that
were
just
like
every
other
american
label
and
that
were
precisely
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
people
reduced
to
achieving
an
identity
in
such
other
ways
they
could
be
and
hayes
and
yet
could
be
with
all
presumptions
missing
well
what
these
callers
were
it
had
quickly
enough
indeed
cleared
the
situation
a
little
further
that
his
friends
had
absolutely
the
other
time
as
it
came
back
to
him
warned
him
of
his
original
danger
their
anxiety
about
which
had
been
the
last
note
sounded
among
them
what
he
was
afraid
of
with
this
reminiscence
was
that
finding
him
still
safe
they
would
the
next
thing
definitely
congratulate
him
and
perhaps
even
no
less
candidly
ask
him
how
he
had
managed
it
was
with
the
sense
of
nipping
some
such
inquiry
in
the
bud
that
losing
no
time
and
holding
himself
with
a
firm
grip
he
began
on
the
spot
downstairs
to
make
plain
to
them
how
he
had
managed
he
routed
the
possibility
of
the
question
in
short
by
the
assurance
of
his
answer
yes
yes
i
still
here
i
suppose
it
in
a
manner
to
one
profit
that
one
does
such
as
it
is
one
best
he
did
his
best
on
the
present
occasion
did
it
with
the
gravest
face
he
had
ever
worn
and
a
soft
serenity
that
was
like
a
large
damp
sponge
passed
over
their
previous
meeting
over
everything
in
it
that
is
but
the
fact
of
its
pleasantness
we
stand
here
you
see
in
the
old
happily
still
to
be
reconstructed
in
the
mind
eye
in
spite
of
the
havoc
of
time
which
we
have
fortunately
of
late
years
been
able
to
arrest
it
was
of
course
rude
and
humble
but
it
must
have
been
snug
and
quaint
and
we
have
at
least
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
the
tradition
in
respect
to
the
features
that
do
remain
is
delightfully
uninterrupted
across
that
threshold
he
habitually
passed
through
those
low
windows
in
childhood
he
peered
out
into
the
world
that
he
was
to
make
so
much
happier
by
the
gift
to
it
of
his
genius
over
the
boards
of
this
floor
that
is
over
of
them
for
we
be
carried
away
his
little
feet
often
pattered
and
the
beams
of
this
ceiling
we
must
really
in
some
places
take
care
of
heads
he
endeavoured
in
boyish
strife
to
jump
up
and
touch
it
not
often
that
in
the
early
home
of
genius
and
renown
the
whole
tenor
of
existence
is
laid
so
bare
not
often
that
we
are
able
to
retrace
from
point
to
point
and
from
step
to
step
its
connexion
with
objects
with
influences
to
build
it
round
again
with
the
little
solid
facts
out
of
which
it
sprang
this
therefore
i
need
scarcely
remind
you
is
what
makes
the
small
space
between
these
walls
so
modest
to
measurement
so
insignificant
of
aspect
unique
on
all
the
earth
nothing
like
morris
gedge
went
on
insisting
as
solemnly
and
softly
for
his
bewildered
hearers
as
over
a
there
nothing
at
all
like
it
anywhere
in
the
world
there
nothing
only
reflect
for
the
combination
of
greatness
and
as
we
venture
to
say
of
intimacy
you
may
find
elsewhere
perhaps
absolutely
fewer
changes
but
where
shall
you
find
a
equally
diffused
uncontested
and
undisturbed
where
in
particular
shall
you
find
on
the
part
of
the
abiding
spirit
an
equally
towering
eminence
you
may
find
elsewhere
eminence
of
a
considerable
order
but
where
shall
you
find
it
do
you
see
changes
after
all
so
few
and
the
contemporary
element
caught
so
as
it
were
in
the
very
fact
his
visitors
at
first
confounded
but
gradually
spellbound
were
still
gaping
with
the
universal
gape
wondering
he
judged
into
what
strange
pleasantry
he
had
been
suddenly
moved
to
explode
and
yet
beginning
to
see
in
him
an
intention
beyond
a
joke
so
that
they
started
at
this
point
they
almost
jumped
when
by
as
rapid
a
transition
he
made
toward
the
old
fireplace
a
dash
that
seemed
to
illustrate
precisely
the
act
of
eager
catching
it
is
in
this
old
the
quaint
inglenook
of
our
ancestors
just
there
in
the
far
angle
where
his
little
stool
was
placed
and
where
i
daresay
if
we
could
look
close
enough
we
should
find
the
hearth
stone
scraped
with
his
little
feet
that
we
see
the
inconceivable
child
gazing
into
the
blaze
of
the
old
oaken
logs
and
making
out
there
pictures
and
stories
see
him
conning
with
curly
bent
head
his
hornbook
or
poring
over
some
scrap
of
an
ancient
ballad
some
page
of
some
such
volume
of
chronicles
as
lay
we
may
be
sure
in
his
father
it
was
he
even
himself
felt
at
this
moment
wonderfully
done
no
auditors
for
all
his
thousands
had
ever
yet
so
inspired
him
the
odd
slightly
alarmed
shyness
in
the
two
faces
as
if
in
a
in
their
good
society
exactly
some
act
incongruous
something
grazing
the
indecent
had
abruptly
been
perpetrated
the
painful
reality
of
which
stayed
itself
before
coming
home
the
visible
effect
on
his
friends
in
fine
wound
him
up
as
to
the
sense
that
were
worth
the
trick
it
came
of
itself
now
he
had
got
it
so
by
heart
but
perhaps
really
it
had
never
come
so
well
with
the
staleness
so
disguised
the
interest
so
renewed
and
the
clerical
unction
demanded
by
the
priestly
character
so
successfully
distilled
hayes
of
new
york
had
more
than
once
looked
at
his
wife
and
hayes
of
new
york
had
more
than
once
looked
at
her
husband
only
up
to
now
with
a
stolen
glance
with
eyes
it
had
been
easy
to
detach
from
the
remarkable
countenance
by
the
aid
of
which
their
entertainer
held
them
at
present
however
after
an
exchange
less
furtive
they
ventured
on
a
sign
that
they
had
been
appealed
to
in
vain
charming
charming
mr
gedge
hayes
broke
out
we
feel
that
we
caught
you
in
the
mood
his
wife
hastened
to
assent
it
eased
the
tension
it
be
quite
the
way
except
she
smiled
that
you
be
too
dangerous
you
really
a
genius
gedge
looked
at
her
hard
but
yielding
no
inch
even
though
she
touched
him
there
at
a
point
of
consciousness
that
quivered
this
was
the
prodigy
for
him
and
had
been
the
year
through
that
he
did
it
all
he
found
easily
did
it
better
than
he
had
done
anything
else
in
life
with
so
high
and
broad
an
effect
in
truth
an
inspiration
so
rich
and
free
that
his
poor
wife
now
literally
had
been
moved
more
than
once
to
fresh
fear
she
had
had
her
bad
moments
he
knew
after
taking
the
measure
of
his
new
direction
moments
of
readjusted
suspicion
in
which
she
wondered
if
he
had
simply
adopted
another
a
different
perversity
there
would
be
more
than
one
fashion
of
giving
away
the
show
and
was
perhaps
a
question
of
giving
it
away
by
excess
he
could
dish
them
by
too
much
romance
as
well
as
by
too
little
she
had
hitherto
fairly
grasped
that
there
might
too
much
it
was
a
way
like
another
at
any
rate
of
reducing
the
place
to
the
absurd
which
reduction
if
he
did
look
out
would
reduce
again
to
the
prospect
of
the
streets
and
this
time
surely
without
appeal
it
all
depended
indeed
he
knew
she
knew
that
on
how
much
and
the
others
how
much
the
body
in
a
word
would
take
he
knew
she
knew
what
he
himself
held
it
would
take
that
he
considered
no
limit
could
be
imputed
to
the
quantity
they
simply
wanted
it
piled
up
and
so
did
every
one
else
wherefore
if
no
one
reported
him
as
before
why
were
they
to
be
uneasy
it
was
in
consequence
of
idiots
tempted
to
reason
that
he
had
been
dealt
with
before
but
as
there
was
now
no
form
of
idiocy
that
he
did
systematically
flatter
goading
it
on
really
to
its
private
doom
who
was
ever
to
pull
the
string
of
the
guillotine
the
axe
was
in
the
air
yes
but
in
a
world
gorged
to
satiety
there
were
no
revolutions
and
it
had
been
vain
for
isabel
to
ask
if
the
other
also
had
come
out
of
the
blue
there
was
actually
proof
positive
that
the
winds
were
now
at
rest
how
could
they
be
more
so
he
appealed
to
the
receipts
these
were
golden
days
the
show
had
never
so
flourished
so
he
had
argued
so
he
was
arguing
still
and
it
had
to
be
owned
with
every
appearance
in
his
favour
yet
if
he
inwardly
winced
at
the
tribute
to
his
plausibility
rendered
by
his
flushed
friends
this
was
because
he
felt
in
it
the
real
ground
of
his
optimism
the
charming
woman
before
him
acknowledged
his
genius
as
he
himself
had
had
to
do
he
had
been
surprised
at
his
facility
until
he
had
grown
used
to
it
whether
or
no
he
had
as
a
fresh
menace
to
his
future
found
a
new
perversity
he
had
found
a
vocation
much
older
evidently
than
he
had
at
first
been
prepared
to
recognise
he
had
done
himself
injustice
he
liked
to
be
brave
because
it
came
so
easy
he
could
measure
it
off
by
the
yard
it
was
in
the
birthroom
above
all
that
he
continued
to
do
this
having
ushered
up
his
companions
without
as
he
was
still
more
elated
to
feel
the
turn
of
a
hair
she
might
take
it
as
she
liked
but
he
had
had
the
lucidity
all
that
is
for
his
own
safety
to
meet
without
the
grace
of
an
answer
the
homage
of
her
beautiful
smile
she
took
it
apparently
and
her
husband
took
it
but
as
a
part
of
his
odd
humour
and
they
followed
him
aloft
with
faces
now
a
little
more
responsive
to
the
manner
in
which
on
spot
he
would
naturally
come
out
he
came
out
according
to
the
word
of
his
assured
private
receipt
strong
he
missed
a
little
in
truth
the
usual
question
from
them
the
inveterate
artless
cue
with
which
from
moment
to
moment
clustered
troops
had
for
a
year
obliged
him
and
hayes
were
from
new
york
but
it
was
a
little
like
singing
as
he
had
heard
one
of
his
americans
once
say
about
something
to
a
boston
audience
he
did
none
the
less
what
he
could
and
it
was
ever
his
practice
to
stop
still
at
a
certain
spot
in
the
room
and
after
having
secured
attention
by
look
and
gesture
suddenly
shoot
off
here
they
always
understood
the
good
people
he
could
fairly
love
them
now
for
it
they
always
said
breathlessly
and
unanimously
there
and
stared
down
at
the
designated
point
quite
as
if
some
trace
of
the
grand
event
were
still
to
be
made
out
this
movement
produced
he
again
looked
round
consider
it
well
spot
of
earth
oh
but
it
is
the
boldest
spirit
there
was
always
a
boldest
would
generally
pipe
out
then
the
guardian
of
the
birthplace
would
be
truly
superior
as
if
the
unfortunate
had
figured
the
immortal
coming
up
like
a
potato
through
the
soil
i
not
suggesting
that
he
was
born
on
the
bare
ground
he
was
born
with
an
uncompromising
dig
of
his
heel
there
ought
to
be
a
brass
with
an
inscription
let
in
into
the
floor
it
always
came
birth
and
burial
seedtime
summer
autumn
that
always
with
its
special
right
cadence
thanks
to
his
unfailing
spring
came
too
why
not
as
well
as
into
the
pavement
of
the
church
you
our
grand
old
church
the
former
of
which
questions
nobody
ever
answered
abounding
on
the
other
hand
to
make
up
in
relation
to
the
latter
and
hayes
even
were
at
first
left
dumb
by
it
not
indeed
to
do
them
justice
having
uttered
the
word
that
called
for
it
they
had
uttered
no
word
while
he
kept
the
game
up
and
though
that
made
it
a
little
more
difficult
he
could
yet
stand
triumphant
before
them
after
he
had
finished
with
his
flourish
only
then
it
was
that
hayes
of
new
york
broke
silence
well
if
we
wanted
to
see
i
think
i
may
say
we
quite
satisfied
as
my
wife
says
it
seem
your
line
he
spoke
now
visibly
with
more
ease
as
if
a
light
had
come
though
he
made
no
joke
of
it
for
a
reason
that
presently
appeared
they
were
coming
down
the
little
stair
and
it
was
on
the
descent
that
his
companion
added
her
word
do
you
know
what
we
half
think
and
then
to
her
husband
is
it
dreadful
to
tell
him
they
were
in
the
room
below
and
the
young
woman
also
relieved
expressed
the
feeling
with
gaiety
she
smiled
as
before
at
morris
gedge
treating
him
as
a
person
with
whom
relations
were
possible
yet
remaining
just
uncertain
enough
to
invoke
hayes
opinion
we
awfully
wanted
from
what
we
had
heard
but
she
met
her
graver
face
he
was
not
quite
out
of
the
wood
at
this
she
was
slightly
flurried
but
she
cut
it
short
you
must
know
do
you
that
with
the
crowds
who
listen
to
you
we
have
heard
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
once
more
again
with
force
something
came
over
him
they
had
kept
him
in
mind
they
were
neither
ashamed
nor
afraid
to
show
it
and
it
was
positively
an
interest
on
the
part
of
this
charming
creature
and
this
keen
cautious
gentleman
an
interest
resisting
oblivion
and
surviving
separation
that
had
governed
their
return
their
other
visit
had
been
the
brightest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
but
this
was
the
gravest
so
that
at
the
end
of
a
minute
something
broke
in
him
and
his
mask
dropped
of
itself
he
chucked
as
he
would
have
said
consistency
which
in
its
extinction
left
the
tears
in
his
eyes
his
smile
was
therefore
queer
heard
how
i
going
it
the
young
man
though
still
looking
at
him
hard
felt
sure
with
this
of
his
own
ground
of
course
you
tremendously
talked
about
you
gone
round
the
world
you
heard
of
me
in
america
why
almost
of
nothing
else
that
was
what
made
us
feel
hayes
contributed
that
you
must
see
for
yourselves
again
he
compared
poor
gedge
their
faces
do
you
mean
i
excite
a
scandal
dear
no
admiration
you
renew
so
the
young
man
observed
the
interest
ah
there
it
is
said
gedge
with
eyes
of
adventure
that
seemed
to
rest
beyond
the
atlantic
they
listen
month
after
month
when
they
out
here
as
you
must
have
seen
then
they
go
home
and
talk
but
they
sing
your
praise
our
friend
could
scarce
take
it
in
over
over
there
i
think
you
must
be
even
in
the
papers
without
abuse
oh
we
do
abuse
every
one
hayes
in
her
beauty
it
was
clear
stretched
the
point
they
rave
about
you
then
they
know
nobody
knows
the
young
man
declared
it
was
any
one
knowledge
at
any
rate
that
made
us
uneasy
it
was
your
own
i
mean
your
own
sense
well
call
it
that
we
remembered
and
we
wondered
what
had
happened
so
hayes
now
frankly
laughed
we
came
to
see
gedge
stared
through
his
film
of
tears
came
from
america
to
see
oh
a
part
of
the
way
but
we
would
in
england
have
missed
you
and
now
we
the
young
woman
soothingly
added
gedge
still
could
only
gape
at
the
candour
of
the
tribute
but
he
tried
to
meet
them
it
was
what
was
least
poor
for
him
in
their
own
key
well
how
do
you
like
it
hayes
he
thought
if
their
answer
were
important
laughed
a
little
nervously
oh
you
see
once
more
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
it
too
beastly
easy
you
know
her
husband
raised
his
eyebrows
you
conceal
your
art
the
emotion
yes
that
must
be
easy
the
general
tone
must
flow
but
about
your
facts
so
many
how
do
you
get
through
gedge
wondered
you
think
i
get
too
many
at
this
they
were
amused
together
that
just
what
we
came
to
see
well
you
know
i
felt
my
way
i
gone
step
by
step
you
believe
how
i
tried
it
on
where
you
see
me
is
where
i
come
out
after
which
as
they
said
nothing
you
had
thought
i
come
out
again
they
just
waited
but
the
husband
spoke
are
you
so
awfully
sure
you
are
out
gedge
drew
himself
up
in
the
manner
of
his
moments
of
emotion
almost
conscious
even
that
with
his
sloping
shoulders
his
long
lean
neck
and
his
nose
so
prominent
in
proportion
to
other
matters
he
resembled
the
more
a
giraffe
it
was
now
at
last
he
really
caught
on
i
be
in
danger
again
and
the
danger
is
what
has
moved
you
oh
the
poor
man
fairly
moaned
his
appreciation
of
it
quite
weakened
him
yet
he
pulled
himself
together
you
your
view
of
my
danger
it
was
wondrous
how
with
that
note
definitely
sounded
the
air
was
cleared
lucid
hayes
at
the
end
of
a
minute
had
put
the
thing
in
a
nutshell
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
us
for
being
so
beastly
curious
i
think
poor
gedge
grimaced
you
only
too
beastly
kind
it
all
your
own
fault
his
friend
returned
for
presenting
us
who
are
not
idiots
say
with
so
striking
a
picture
of
a
crisis
at
our
other
visit
you
remember
he
smiled
you
created
an
anxiety
for
the
opposite
reason
therefore
if
should
again
be
a
crisis
for
you
you
really
give
us
the
case
with
an
ideal
completeness
you
make
me
wish
said
morris
gedge
that
it
might
be
one
well
do
try
for
our
amusement
to
bring
one
on
i
do
see
you
know
how
you
can
have
much
margin
take
care
take
care
gedge
did
it
pensive
justice
yes
that
was
what
you
said
a
year
ago
you
did
me
the
honour
to
be
uneasy
as
my
wife
was
which
determined
on
the
young
woman
part
an
immediate
question
may
i
ask
then
if
gedge
is
now
at
rest
no
since
you
do
ask
fears
at
least
that
i
go
too
far
she
believe
in
my
margin
you
see
we
our
scare
after
your
visit
they
came
down
his
friends
were
all
interest
ah
they
came
down
heavy
they
brought
down
that
why
you
down
hayes
sweetly
demanded
ah
but
my
dear
man
her
husband
interposed
you
not
down
you
only
up
a
different
tree
but
you
up
at
the
you
mean
i
take
it
too
high
that
exactly
the
question
the
young
man
answered
and
the
possibility
as
matching
your
first
danger
is
just
what
we
felt
we
could
if
you
did
mind
miss
the
measure
of
gedge
gazed
at
him
i
feel
that
i
know
what
you
at
bottom
we
at
bottom
surely
that
you
all
right
in
spite
of
the
fool
it
makes
of
every
one
hayes
of
new
york
smiled
say
of
that
we
only
ask
to
believe
every
one
a
fool
only
you
have
been
without
reassurance
able
to
imagine
fools
of
the
size
that
my
case
demands
and
gedge
had
a
pause
while
as
if
on
the
chance
of
some
proof
his
companion
waited
well
i
wo
pretend
to
you
that
your
anxiety
has
made
me
does
threaten
to
make
me
a
bit
nervous
though
i
do
quite
understand
it
if
as
you
say
people
but
rave
about
me
oh
report
was
from
the
other
side
people
in
our
country
so
very
easily
rave
you
seen
small
children
laugh
to
shrieks
when
tickled
in
a
new
place
so
there
are
amiable
millions
with
us
who
are
but
small
shrieking
children
they
perpetually
present
new
places
for
the
tickler
what
we
seen
in
further
lights
hayes
pursued
is
your
people
the
committee
the
board
or
whatever
the
powers
to
whom
you
responsible
call
them
my
friend
then
my
original
backer
though
i
admit
for
that
reason
perhaps
my
most
formidable
critic
it
with
him
practically
i
deal
or
rather
it
by
him
i
dealt
with
dealt
with
before
i
stand
or
fall
by
him
but
he
has
given
me
my
head
may
he
then
want
you
hayes
inquired
just
to
show
as
flagrantly
running
away
of
course
i
see
what
you
mean
i
riding
blindly
for
a
fall
and
they
watching
to
be
tender
of
me
for
the
smash
that
may
come
of
itself
it
machiavellic
but
everything
possible
and
what
did
you
just
now
mean
gedge
asked
especially
if
you
only
heard
of
my
prosperity
by
your
lights
his
friends
for
an
instant
looked
embarrassed
but
hayes
came
to
the
point
we
heard
of
your
prosperity
but
we
also
remember
within
a
few
minutes
heard
i
was
determined
you
said
gedge
i
good
then
but
i
overdo
his
strained
grin
was
still
sceptical
thus
challenged
at
any
rate
his
visitor
pronounced
well
if
you
do
if
at
the
end
of
six
months
more
it
clear
that
you
have
overdone
then
then
what
then
it
great
but
it
great
greater
than
anything
of
the
sort
ever
was
i
overdo
thank
goodness
yes
or
i
would
if
it
were
a
thing
you
oh
well
if
there
that
you
ca
with
which
and
an
expressive
gesture
hayes
threw
up
his
fears
his
wife
however
for
a
moment
seemed
unable
to
let
them
go
do
they
want
then
truth
none
even
for
the
mere
look
of
it
the
look
of
it
said
morris
gedge
is
what
i
give
it
made
them
the
others
exchange
a
look
of
their
own
then
she
smiled
oh
well
if
they
think
so
you
at
least
do
you
like
my
wife
which
indeed
i
remember
gedge
added
is
a
similarity
i
expressed
a
year
ago
the
wish
for
at
any
rate
i
frighten
the
young
husband
with
an
ah
wives
are
terrible
smoothed
it
over
and
their
visit
would
have
failed
of
further
excuse
had
not
at
this
instant
a
movement
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
suddenly
engaged
them
the
evening
had
so
nearly
closed
in
though
gedge
in
the
course
of
their
talk
had
lighted
the
lamp
nearest
them
that
they
had
not
distinguished
in
connexion
with
the
opening
of
the
door
of
communication
to
the
lodge
the
appearance
of
another
person
an
eager
woman
who
in
her
impatience
had
barely
paused
before
advancing
gedge
her
identity
took
but
a
few
seconds
to
become
vivid
was
upon
them
and
she
had
not
been
too
late
for
hayes
last
remark
gedge
saw
at
once
that
she
had
come
with
news
no
need
even
for
that
certitude
of
her
quick
retort
to
the
words
in
the
air
you
may
say
as
well
sir
that
they
often
poor
wives
terrified
she
knew
nothing
of
the
friends
whom
at
so
unnatural
an
hour
he
was
showing
about
but
there
was
no
livelier
sign
for
him
that
this
did
matter
than
the
possibility
with
which
she
intensely
charged
her
to
see
you
at
once
letting
it
so
to
speak
fly
in
his
face
he
has
been
with
you
only
a
minute
he
there
but
it
you
he
wants
to
see
he
looked
at
the
others
and
what
does
he
want
dear
god
knows
there
it
is
it
his
horrid
hour
it
that
other
time
she
had
nervously
turned
to
the
others
overflowing
to
them
in
her
dismay
for
all
their
strangeness
quite
as
he
said
to
himself
like
a
woman
of
the
people
she
was
the
bareheaded
good
wife
talking
in
the
street
about
the
row
in
the
house
and
it
was
in
this
character
that
he
instantly
introduced
her
my
dear
doubting
wife
who
will
do
her
best
to
entertain
you
while
i
wait
upon
our
friend
and
he
explained
to
her
as
he
could
his
now
protesting
companions
and
hayes
of
new
york
who
have
been
here
before
he
knew
without
knowing
why
that
her
announcement
chilled
him
he
failed
at
least
to
see
why
it
should
chill
him
so
much
his
good
friends
had
themselves
been
visibly
affected
by
it
and
heaven
knew
that
the
depths
of
brooding
fancy
in
him
were
easily
stirred
by
contact
if
they
had
wanted
a
crisis
they
accordingly
had
found
one
albeit
they
had
already
asked
leave
to
retire
before
it
this
he
would
have
ah
no
you
must
really
see
but
we
sha
be
able
to
bear
it
you
know
said
the
young
woman
if
it
to
turn
you
out
her
crudity
attested
her
sincerity
and
it
was
the
latter
doubtless
that
instantly
held
gedge
it
to
turn
us
out
has
he
told
you
that
madam
hayes
inquired
of
her
it
being
wondrous
how
the
breath
of
doom
had
drawn
them
together
no
not
told
me
but
there
something
in
him
there
i
mean
in
his
awful
manner
that
matches
too
well
with
other
things
we
seen
said
the
poor
pale
lady
other
things
enough
the
young
woman
almost
clutched
her
is
his
manner
very
awful
it
simply
the
manner
gedge
interposed
of
a
very
great
man
well
very
great
men
said
his
wife
are
very
awful
things
it
exactly
he
laughed
what
we
finding
out
but
i
must
keep
him
waiting
our
friends
here
he
went
on
are
directly
interested
you
must
mind
you
let
them
go
until
we
know
hayes
however
held
him
he
found
himself
stayed
we
so
directly
interested
that
i
want
you
to
understand
this
if
anything
happens
yes
said
gedge
all
gentle
as
he
faltered
well
must
set
you
up
hayes
quickly
abounded
oh
come
to
us
again
he
could
but
take
them
in
they
were
really
wonderful
folk
and
with
it
all
but
and
hayes
it
affected
even
isabel
through
her
alarm
though
the
balm
in
a
manner
seemed
to
foretell
the
wound
he
had
reached
the
threshold
of
his
own
quarters
he
stood
there
as
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
judgement
but
he
laughed
at
least
he
could
be
gallant
in
going
up
for
sentence
very
good
then
i
come
to
you
this
was
very
well
but
it
did
prevent
his
heart
a
minute
later
at
the
end
of
the
passage
from
thumping
with
beats
he
could
count
he
had
paused
again
before
going
in
on
the
other
side
of
this
second
door
his
poor
future
was
to
be
let
loose
at
him
it
was
broken
at
best
and
spiritless
but
was
there
like
a
in
a
cage
all
tights
and
spangles
and
circus
attitudes
to
give
it
a
cut
with
the
smart
official
whip
and
make
it
spring
at
him
it
was
during
this
moment
that
he
fully
measured
the
effect
for
his
nerves
of
the
impression
made
on
his
so
oddly
earnest
friends
whose
earnestness
he
verily
in
the
spasm
of
this
last
effort
came
within
an
ace
of
resenting
they
had
upset
him
by
contact
he
was
afraid
literally
of
meeting
his
doom
on
his
knees
it
would
have
taken
much
more
he
absolutely
felt
to
make
him
approach
with
his
forehead
in
the
dust
the
great
man
whose
wrath
was
to
be
averted
and
hayes
of
new
york
had
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
but
was
it
to
be
reserved
for
to
make
him
cry
like
a
baby
he
wished
yes
while
he
palpitated
that
and
hayes
of
new
york
had
had
such
an
eccentricity
of
interest
for
it
seemed
somehow
to
come
from
that
he
was
going
so
fast
to
pieces
before
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
however
he
had
another
queer
instant
making
out
that
it
had
been
strictly
his
case
that
was
interesting
his
funny
power
however
accidental
to
show
as
in
a
picture
the
attitude
of
others
not
his
poor
pale
personality
it
was
this
latter
quantity
none
the
less
that
was
marching
to
execution
it
is
to
our
friend
credit
that
he
as
he
prepared
to
turn
the
knob
that
he
was
going
to
be
hanged
and
certainly
not
less
to
his
credit
that
his
wife
on
the
chance
had
his
supreme
thought
here
it
was
that
possibly
with
his
last
articulate
breath
he
thanked
his
stars
such
as
they
were
for
and
hayes
of
new
york
at
least
they
would
take
care
of
her
they
were
doing
that
certainly
with
some
success
when
he
returned
to
them
ten
minutes
later
she
sat
between
them
in
the
beautified
birthplace
and
he
could
have
been
sure
afterwards
that
each
was
holding
her
hand
the
three
together
had
at
any
rate
the
effect
of
recalling
to
him
it
was
too
whimsical
some
picture
a
sentimental
print
seen
and
admired
in
his
youth
a
waiting
for
the
verdict
a
counting
the
hours
or
something
of
that
sort
humble
respectability
in
suspense
about
humble
innocence
he
did
know
how
he
himself
looked
and
he
did
care
the
great
thing
was
that
he
was
crying
though
he
might
have
been
the
glitter
in
his
eyes
was
assuredly
dry
though
that
there
a
glitter
or
something
slightly
to
bewilder
the
faces
of
the
others
as
they
rose
to
meet
him
sufficiently
proved
his
wife
eyes
pierced
his
own
but
it
was
hayes
of
new
york
who
spoke
it
then
for
that
he
only
looked
at
them
at
first
he
felt
he
might
now
enjoy
it
yes
it
was
for
i
mean
it
was
about
the
way
i
been
going
on
he
came
to
speak
of
it
and
he
gone
hayes
permitted
himself
to
inquire
he
gone
it
over
isabel
hoarsely
asked
it
over
then
we
go
this
it
was
that
he
enjoyed
no
my
dear
we
stay
there
was
fairly
a
triple
gasp
relief
took
time
to
operate
then
why
did
he
come
in
the
fulness
of
his
kind
heart
and
of
discussed
and
decreed
satisfaction
to
express
their
sense
hayes
broke
into
a
laugh
but
his
wife
wanted
to
know
of
the
grand
work
you
doing
of
the
way
i
polish
it
off
they
most
handsome
about
it
the
receipts
it
appears
speak
he
was
nursing
his
effect
isabel
intently
watched
him
and
the
others
hung
on
his
lips
yes
speak
well
volumes
they
tell
the
truth
at
this
hayes
laughed
again
oh
at
least
do
near
him
thus
once
more
gedge
knew
their
intelligence
as
one
which
was
so
good
a
consciousness
to
get
back
that
his
tension
now
relaxed
as
by
the
snap
of
a
spring
and
he
felt
his
old
face
at
ease
so
you
ca
say
he
continued
that
we
do
want
it
i
bow
to
it
the
young
man
smiled
it
what
i
said
then
it
it
great
said
morris
gedge
it
could
be
greater
his
wife
still
watched
him
her
irony
hung
behind
then
we
just
as
we
were
no
not
as
we
were
she
jumped
at
it
better
better
they
give
us
a
rise
of
income
of
our
sweet
little
stipend
by
a
vote
of
the
committee
that
what
as
chairman
he
came
to
announce
the
very
echoes
of
the
birthplace
were
themselves
for
the
instant
hushed
the
warden
three
companions
showed
in
the
conscious
air
a
struggle
for
their
own
breath
but
isabel
almost
with
a
shriek
was
the
first
to
recover
hers
they
double
us
well
call
it
that
recognition
there
you
are
isabel
uttered
another
sound
but
this
time
inarticulate
partly
because
hayes
of
new
york
had
already
jumped
at
her
to
kiss
her
hayes
meanwhile
as
with
too
much
to
say
but
put
out
his
hand
which
our
friend
took
in
silence
so
gedge
had
the
last
word
and
there
are
