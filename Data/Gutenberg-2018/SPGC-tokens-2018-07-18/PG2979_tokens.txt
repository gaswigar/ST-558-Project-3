madame

dedini
zanovitch
zen
i
am
obliged
to
leave
i
arrive
at
bologna
general
albergati
without
speaking
at
any
length
i
asked
the
young
grand
duke
to
give
me
an
asylum
in
his
dominions
for
as
long
as
i
might
care
to
stay
i
anticipated
any
questions
he
might
have
asked
by
telling
him
the
reasons
which
had
made
me
an
exile
from
my
native
land
as
to
my
necessities
i
added
i
shall
ask
for
help
of
no
one
i
have
sufficient
funds
to
ensure
my
independence
i
think
of
devoting
the
whole
of
my
time
to
study
so
long
as
your
conduct
is
good
he
replied
the
laws
guarantee
your
freedom
but
i
am
glad
you
have
applied
to
me
whom
do
you
know
in
florence
ten
years
ago
my
lord
i
had
some
distinguished
acquaintances
here
but
now
i
propose
to
live
in
retirement
and
do
not
intend
renewing
any
old
friendships
such
was
my
conversation
with
the
young
sovereign
and
after
his
assurances
i
concluded
that
no
one
would
molest
me
my
adventures
in
tuscany
the
years
before
were
in
all
probability
forgotten
or
almost
forgotten
as
the
new
government
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
old
after
my
interview
with
the
grand
duke
i
went
to
a
bookseller
shop
and
ordered
some
books
a
gentleman
in
the
shop
hearing
me
making
enquiries
about
greek
works
accosted
me
and
we
got
on
well
together
i
told
him
i
was
working
at
a
translation
of
the
iliad
and
in
return
he
informed
me
that
he
was
making
a
collection
of
greek
epigrams
which
he
wished
to
publish
in
greek
and
italian
i
told
him
i
should
like
to
see
this
work
whereupon
he
asked
me
where
i
lived
i
told
him
learnt
his
name
and
address
and
called
on
him
the
next
day
he
returned
the
visit
and
we
became
fast
friends
though
we
never
either
walked
or
ate
together
this
worthy
florentine
was
named
or
is
named
if
he
be
still
alive
everard
de
medici
i
was
very
comfortable
with
allegranti
i
had
the
quiet
so
necessary
to
literary
labours
but
nevertheless
i
made
up
my
mind
to
change
my
lodging
magdalena
my
landlord
niece
was
so
clever
and
charming
though
but
a
child
that
she
continually
disturbed
my
studies
she
came
into
my
room
wished
me
good
day
asked
me
what
kind
of
a
night
i
had
spent
if
i
wanted
anything
and
the
sight
of
her
grace
and
beauty
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
so
ravished
me
that
i
determined
to
seek
safety
in
flight
a
few
years
later
magdalena
became
a
famous
musician
after
leaving
allegranti
i
took
rooms
in
a
tradesman
house
his
wife
was
ugly
and
he
had
no
pretty
daughters
or
seductive
nieces
there
i
lived
for
three
weeks
like
lafontaine
rat
very
discreetly
about
the
same
time
count
stratico
arrived
at
florence
with
his
pupil
the
chevalier
morosini
who
was
then
eighteen
i
could
not
avoid
calling
on
stratico
he
had
broken
his
leg
some
time
before
and
was
still
unable
to
go
out
with
his
pupil
who
had
all
the
vices
and
none
of
the
virtues
of
youth
consequently
stratico
was
always
afraid
of
something
happening
to
him
and
he
begged
me
to
make
myself
his
companion
and
even
to
share
his
pleasures
so
that
he
might
not
go
into
bad
company
and
dangerous
houses
alone
and
undefended
thus
my
days
of
calm
study
vanished
away
i
had
to
partake
in
the
debauchery
of
a
young
rake
and
all
out
of
pure
sensibility
the
chevalier
morosini
was
a
profligate
he
hated
literature
good
society
and
the
company
of
sensible
people
his
daily
pleasures
were
furious
riding
hard
drinking
and
hard
dissipation
with
prostitutes
whom
he
sometimes
almost
killed
this
young
nobleman
paid
a
man
for
the
sole
service
of
getting
him
a
woman
or
a
girl
every
day
during
the
two
months
which
he
passed
in
florence
i
saved
his
life
a
score
of
times
i
got
very
tired
of
my
duty
but
i
felt
bound
to
persevere
he
was
liberal
to
the
verge
of
recklessness
and
would
never
allow
me
to
pay
for
anything
even
here
however
disputes
often
arose
between
us
as
he
paid
he
wanted
me
to
eat
drink
and
dissipate
in
the
same
measures
as
himself
however
i
had
my
own
way
on
most
occasions
only
giving
in
when
it
suited
me
to
do
so
we
went
to
see
the
opera
at
lucca
and
drought
two
of
the
dancers
home
to
supper
as
the
chevalier
was
drunk
as
usual
he
treated
the
woman
he
had
chosen
a
superb
creature
very
indifferently
the
other
was
pretty
enough
but
i
had
done
nothing
serious
with
her
so
i
proceeded
to
avenge
the
beauty
she
took
me
for
the
chevalier
father
and
advised
me
to
give
him
a
better
education
after
the
chevalier
was
gone
i
betook
myself
to
my
studies
again
but
i
supped
every
night
with
madame
denis
who
had
formerly
been
a
dancer
in
the
king
of
prussia
service
and
had
retired
to
florence
she
was
about
my
age
and
therefore
not
young
but
still
she
had
sufficient
remains
of
her
beauty
to
inspire
a
tender
passion
she
did
not
look
more
than
thirty
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
young
girl
had
excellent
manners
and
was
extremely
intelligent
besides
all
these
advantages
she
had
a
comfortable
apartment
on
the
first
floor
of
one
of
the
largest
cafes
in
florence
in
front
of
her
room
was
a
balcony
where
it
was
delicious
to
sit
and
enjoy
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
reader
may
remember
how
i
had
become
her
friend
at
berlin
in
and
when
we
met
again
at
florence
our
old
flames
were
rekindled
the
chief
boarder
in
the
house
where
she
lived
was
madame
brigonzi
whom
i
had
met
at
memel
this
lady
who
pretended
that
she
had
been
my
mistress
years
before
often
came
into
madame
denis
rooms
with
an
old
lover
of
hers
named
marquis
capponi
he
was
an
agreeable
and
man
and
noticing
that
he
seemed
to
enjoy
my
conversation
i
called
on
him
and
he
called
on
me
leaving
his
card
as
i
was
not
at
home
i
returned
the
visit
and
he
introduced
me
to
his
family
and
invited
me
to
dinner
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
come
to
florence
i
dressed
myself
with
elegance
and
wore
my
jewels
at
the
marquis
capponi
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
corilla
lover
the
marquis
gennori
who
took
me
to
a
house
where
i
met
my
fate
i
fell
in
love
with
madame
a
young
widow
who
had
been
spending
a
few
months
in
paris
this
visit
had
added
to
her
other
attractions
the
charm
of
a
good
manner
which
always
counts
for
so
much
this
unhappy
love
made
the
three
months
longer
which
i
spent
in
florence
painful
to
me
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
october
and
about
that
time
count
medini
arrived
at
florence
without
a
penny
in
his
pocket
and
without
being
able
to
pay
his
vetturino
who
had
arrested
him
the
wretched
man
who
seemed
to
follow
me
wherever
i
went
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
the
house
of
a
poor
irishman
i
do
not
know
how
medini
found
out
that
i
was
at
florence
but
he
wrote
me
a
letter
begging
me
to
come
and
deliver
him
from
the
police
who
besieged
his
room
and
talked
of
taking
him
to
prison
he
said
he
only
wanted
me
to
go
bail
for
him
and
protested
that
i
should
not
run
any
risk
as
he
was
sure
of
being
able
to
pay
in
a
few
days
my
readers
will
be
aware
that
i
had
good
reason
for
not
liking
medini
but
in
spite
of
our
quarrel
i
could
not
despise
his
entreaty
i
even
felt
inclined
to
become
his
surety
if
he
could
prove
his
capability
of
paying
the
sum
for
which
he
had
been
arrested
i
imagined
that
the
sum
must
be
a
small
one
and
could
not
understand
why
the
landlord
did
not
answer
for
him
my
surprise
ceased
however
when
i
entered
his
room
as
soon
as
i
appeared
he
ran
to
embrace
me
begging
me
to
forget
the
past
and
to
extract
him
from
the
painful
position
in
which
he
found
himself
i
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
the
room
and
saw
three
trunks
almost
empty
their
contents
being
scattered
about
the
floor
there
was
his
mistress
whom
i
knew
and
who
had
her
reasons
for
not
liking
me
her
young
sister
who
wept
and
her
mother
who
swore
and
called
medini
a
rogue
saying
that
she
would
complain
of
him
to
the
magistrate
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
allow
her
dresses
and
her
daughter
dresses
to
be
seized
for
his
debts
i
asked
the
landlord
why
he
did
not
go
bail
as
he
had
these
persons
and
their
effects
as
security
the
whole
lot
he
answered
wo
pay
the
vetturino
and
the
sooner
they
are
out
of
my
house
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
i
was
astonished
and
could
not
understand
how
the
bill
could
amount
to
more
than
the
value
of
all
the
clothes
i
saw
on
the
floor
so
i
asked
the
vetturino
to
tell
me
the
extent
of
the
debt
he
gave
me
a
paper
with
medini
signature
the
amount
was
two
hundred
and
forty
crowns
how
in
the
world
i
exclaimed
could
he
contract
this
enormous
debt
i
wondered
no
longer
when
the
vetturino
told
me
that
he
had
served
them
for
the
last
six
weeks
having
conducted
the
count
and
the
three
women
from
rome
to
leghorn
and
from
leghorn
to
pisa
and
from
pisa
to
florence
paying
for
their
board
all
the
way
the
vetturino
will
never
take
me
as
bail
for
such
an
amount
i
said
to
medini
and
even
if
he
would
i
should
never
be
so
foolish
as
to
contract
such
a
debt
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
in
the
next
room
said
he
i
will
put
the
matter
clearly
before
you
certainly
two
of
the
police
would
have
prevented
his
going
into
the
next
room
on
the
plea
that
he
might
escape
through
the
window
but
i
said
i
would
be
answerable
for
him
just
then
the
poor
vetturino
came
in
and
kissed
my
hand
saying
that
if
i
would
go
bail
for
the
count
he
would
let
me
have
three
months
wherein
to
find
the
money
as
it
happened
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
taken
me
to
rome
with
the
englishwoman
who
had
been
seduced
by
the
actor
i
told
him
to
wait
a
moment
medini
who
was
a
great
talker
and
a
dreadful
liar
thought
to
persuade
me
by
shewing
me
a
number
of
open
letters
commending
him
in
pompous
terms
to
the
best
houses
in
florence
i
read
the
letters
but
i
found
no
mention
of
money
in
them
and
i
told
him
as
much
i
know
said
he
but
there
is
play
going
on
in
these
houses
and
i
am
sure
of
gaining
immense
sums
you
may
be
aware
that
i
have
no
confidence
in
your
good
luck
then
i
have
another
resource
what
is
that
he
shewed
me
a
bundle
of
manuscript
which
i
found
to
be
an
excellent
translation
of
voltaire
henriade
into
italian
verse
tasso
himself
could
not
have
done
it
better
he
said
he
hoped
to
finish
the
poem
at
florence
and
to
present
it
to
the
grand
duke
who
would
be
sure
to
make
him
a
magnificent
present
and
to
constitute
him
his
favourite
i
would
not
undeceive
him
but
i
laughed
to
myself
knowing
that
the
grand
duke
only
made
a
pretence
of
loving
literature
a
certain
abbe
fontaine
a
clever
man
amused
him
with
a
little
natural
history
the
only
science
in
which
he
took
any
interest
he
preferred
the
worst
prose
to
the
best
verse
not
having
sufficient
intellect
to
enjoy
the
subtle
charms
of
poetry
in
reality
he
had
only
two
passions
women
and
money
after
spending
two
wearisome
hours
with
medini
whose
wit
was
great
and
his
judgment
small
after
heartily
repenting
of
having
yielded
to
my
curiosity
and
having
paid
him
a
visit
i
said
shortly
that
i
could
do
nothing
for
him
despair
drives
men
crazy
as
i
was
making
for
the
door
he
seized
me
by
the
collar
he
did
not
reflect
in
his
dire
extremity
that
he
had
no
arms
that
i
was
stronger
than
he
that
i
had
twice
drawn
his
blood
and
that
the
police
the
landlord
the
vetturirco
and
the
servants
were
in
the
next
room
i
was
not
coward
enough
to
call
for
help
i
caught
hold
of
his
neck
with
both
hands
and
squeezed
him
till
he
was
nearly
choked
he
had
to
let
go
at
last
and
then
i
took
hold
of
his
collar
and
asked
him
if
he
had
gone
mad
i
sent
him
against
the
wall
and
opened
the
door
and
the
police
came
in
i
told
the
vetturino
that
i
would
on
no
account
be
medini
surety
or
be
answerable
for
him
in
any
way
just
as
i
was
going
out
he
leapt
forward
crying
that
i
must
not
abandon
him
i
had
opened
the
door
and
the
police
fearing
he
would
escape
ran
forward
to
get
hold
of
him
then
began
an
interesting
battle
medini
who
had
no
arms
and
was
only
in
his
proceeded
to
distribute
kicks
cuffs
and
blows
amongst
the
four
cowards
who
had
their
swords
at
their
sides
whilst
i
held
the
door
to
prevent
the
irishman
going
out
and
calling
for
assistance
medini
whose
nose
was
bleeding
and
his
dress
all
torn
persisted
in
fighting
till
the
four
policemen
let
him
alone
i
liked
his
courage
and
pitied
him
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
i
asked
his
two
liveried
servants
who
were
standing
by
me
why
they
had
not
helped
their
master
one
said
he
owed
him
six
months
wages
and
the
other
said
he
wanted
to
arrest
him
on
his
own
account
as
medini
was
endeavouring
to
staunch
the
blood
in
a
basin
of
water
the
vetturino
told
him
that
as
i
refused
to
be
his
surety
he
must
go
to
prison
i
was
moved
by
the
scene
that
i
had
witnessed
and
said
to
the
vetturino
give
him
a
fortnight
respite
and
if
he
escapes
before
the
expiration
of
that
term
i
will
pay
you
he
thought
it
over
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
very
good
sir
but
i
am
not
going
to
pay
any
legal
expenses
i
enquired
how
much
the
costs
amounted
to
and
paid
them
laughing
at
the
policemen
claim
of
damages
for
blows
they
had
received
then
the
two
rascally
servants
said
that
if
i
would
not
be
surety
in
the
same
manner
on
their
account
they
would
have
medini
arrested
however
medini
called
out
to
me
to
pay
no
attention
to
them
whatever
when
i
had
given
the
vetturino
his
acknowledgment
and
paid
the
four
or
five
crowns
charged
by
the
police
medini
told
me
that
he
had
more
to
say
to
me
but
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
went
home
to
dinner
two
hours
later
one
of
his
servants
came
to
me
and
promised
if
i
would
give
him
six
sequins
to
warn
me
if
his
master
made
any
preparations
for
flight
i
told
him
drily
that
his
zeal
was
useless
to
me
as
i
was
quite
sure
that
the
count
would
pay
all
his
debts
within
the
term
and
the
next
morning
i
wrote
to
medini
informing
him
of
the
step
his
servant
had
taken
he
replied
with
a
long
letter
full
of
thanks
in
which
he
exerted
all
his
eloquence
to
persuade
me
to
repair
his
fortunes
i
did
not
answer
however
his
good
genius
who
still
protected
him
brought
a
person
to
florence
who
drew
him
out
of
the
difficulty
this
person
was
premislas
zanovitch
who
afterwards
became
as
famous
as
his
brother
who
cheated
the
amsterdam
merchants
and
adopted
the
style
of
prince
scanderbeck
i
shall
speak
of
him
later
on
both
these
finished
cheats
came
to
a
bad
end
premislas
zanovitch
was
then
at
the
happy
age
of
he
was
the
son
of
a
gentleman
of
budua
a
town
on
the
borders
of
albania
and
dalmatia
formerly
subject
to
the
venetian
republic
and
now
to
the
grand
turk
in
classic
times
it
was
known
as
epirus
premislas
was
a
young
man
of
great
intelligence
and
after
having
studied
at
venice
and
contracted
a
venetian
taste
for
pleasures
and
enjoyments
of
all
sorts
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
return
to
budua
where
his
only
associates
would
be
dull
sclavs
uneducated
unintellectual
coarse
and
brutish
consequently
when
premislas
and
his
still
more
talented
brother
stephen
were
ordered
by
the
council
of
ten
to
enjoy
the
vast
sums
they
had
gained
at
play
in
their
own
country
they
resolved
to
become
adventurers
one
took
the
north
and
the
other
the
south
of
europe
and
both
cheated
and
duped
whenever
the
opportunity
for
doing
so
presented
itself
i
had
seen
premislas
when
he
was
a
child
and
had
already
heard
reports
of
a
notable
achievement
of
his
at
naples
he
had
cheated
the
chevalier
de
morosini
by
persuading
him
to
become
his
surety
to
the
extent
of
six
thousand
ducats
and
now
he
arrived
in
florence
in
a
handsome
carriage
bringing
his
mistress
with
him
and
having
two
tall
lackeys
and
a
valet
in
his
service
he
took
good
apartments
hired
a
carriage
rented
a
box
at
the
opera
had
a
skilled
cook
and
gave
his
mistress
a
he
then
shewed
himself
at
the
best
club
richly
dressed
and
covered
with
jewellery
he
introduced
himself
under
the
name
of
count
premislas
zanovitch
there
is
a
club
in
florence
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
nobility
any
stranger
can
go
there
without
being
introduced
but
so
much
the
worse
for
him
if
his
appearance
fails
to
indicate
his
right
to
be
present
the
florentines
are
ice
towards
him
leave
him
alone
and
behave
in
such
a
manner
that
the
visit
is
seldom
repeated
the
club
is
at
once
decent
and
licentious
the
papers
are
to
be
read
there
games
of
all
kinds
are
played
food
and
drink
may
be
had
and
even
love
is
available
for
ladies
frequent
the
club
zanovitch
did
not
wait
to
be
spoken
to
but
made
himself
agreeable
to
everyone
and
congratulated
himself
on
mixing
in
such
distinguished
company
talked
about
naples
which
he
had
just
left
brought
in
his
own
name
with
great
adroitness
played
high
lost
merrily
paid
after
pretending
to
forget
all
about
his
debts
and
in
short
pleased
everyone
i
heard
all
this
the
next
day
from
the
marquis
capponi
who
said
that
someone
had
asked
him
if
he
knew
me
whereat
he
answered
that
when
i
left
venice
he
was
at
college
but
that
he
had
often
heard
his
father
speak
of
me
in
very
high
terms
he
knew
both
the
chevalier
morosini
and
count
medini
and
had
a
good
deal
to
say
in
praise
of
the
latter
the
marquis
asked
me
if
i
knew
him
and
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
without
feeling
it
my
duty
to
disclose
certain
circumstances
which
might
not
have
been
advantageous
to
him
and
as
madame
denis
seemed
curious
to
make
his
acquaintance
the
chevalier
puzzi
promised
to
bring
him
to
see
her
which
he
did
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
i
happened
to
be
with
madame
denis
when
puzzi
presented
zanovitch
and
i
saw
before
me
a
young
men
who
seemed
by
his
confident
manner
to
be
sure
of
success
in
all
his
undertakings
he
was
not
exactly
handsome
but
he
had
a
perfect
manner
and
an
air
of
gaiety
which
seemed
infectious
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
good
society
he
was
by
no
means
an
egotist
and
seemed
never
at
a
loss
for
something
to
talk
about
i
led
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
his
country
and
he
gave
me
an
amusing
description
of
it
talking
of
his
of
which
was
within
the
domains
of
the
a
place
where
gaiety
was
unknown
and
where
the
most
determined
misanthrope
would
die
of
melancholy
as
soon
as
he
heard
my
name
he
began
speaking
to
me
in
a
tone
of
the
most
delicate
flattery
i
saw
the
makings
of
a
great
adventurer
in
him
but
i
thought
his
luxury
would
prove
the
weak
point
in
his
cuirass
i
thought
him
something
like
what
i
had
been
fifteen
years
ago
but
as
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
had
my
resources
i
could
not
help
pitying
him
zanovitch
paid
me
a
visit
and
told
me
that
medini
position
had
excited
his
pity
and
that
he
had
therefore
paid
his
debts
i
applauded
his
generosity
but
i
formed
the
conclusion
that
they
had
laid
some
plot
between
them
and
that
i
should
soon
hear
of
the
results
of
this
new
alliance
i
returned
zanovitch
call
the
next
day
he
was
at
table
with
his
mistress
whom
i
should
not
have
recognized
if
she
had
not
pronounced
my
name
directly
she
saw
me
as
she
had
addressed
me
as
don
giacomo
i
called
her
donna
ippolita
but
in
a
voice
which
indicated
that
i
was
not
certain
of
her
identity
she
told
me
i
was
quite
right
i
had
supped
with
her
at
naples
in
company
with
lord
baltimore
and
she
was
very
pretty
then
zanovitch
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
the
following
day
and
i
should
have
thanked
him
and
begged
to
be
excused
if
donna
ippolita
had
not
pressed
me
to
come
she
assured
me
that
i
should
find
good
company
there
and
that
the
cook
would
excel
himself
i
felt
rather
curious
to
see
the
company
and
with
the
idea
of
shewing
zanovitch
that
i
was
not
likely
to
become
a
charge
on
his
purse
i
dressed
myself
magnificently
once
more
as
i
had
expected
i
found
medini
and
his
mistress
there
with
two
foreign
ladies
and
their
attendant
cavaliers
and
a
and
venetian
between
and
forty
whom
i
would
not
have
recognized
if
zanovitch
had
not
told
me
his
name
alois
zen
zen
was
a
patrician
name
and
i
felt
obliged
to
ask
what
titles
i
ought
to
give
him
such
titles
as
one
old
friend
gives
another
though
it
is
very
possible
you
do
not
recollect
me
as
i
was
only
ten
years
old
when
we
saw
each
other
last
zen
then
told
me
he
was
the
son
of
the
captain
i
had
known
when
i
was
under
arrest
at
andrews
that
years
ago
but
i
remember
you
though
you
had
not
had
the
in
those
days
i
saw
that
he
was
annoyed
by
this
remark
but
it
was
his
fault
as
he
had
no
business
to
say
where
he
had
known
me
or
who
his
father
was
he
was
the
son
of
a
noble
venetian
a
in
every
sense
of
the
word
when
i
met
him
at
florence
he
had
just
come
from
madrid
where
he
had
made
a
lot
of
money
by
holding
a
bank
at
faro
in
the
house
of
the
venetian
ambassador
marco
zen
i
was
glad
to
meet
him
but
i
found
out
before
the
dinner
was
over
that
he
was
completely
devoid
of
education
and
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
but
he
was
well
content
with
the
one
talent
he
possessed
namely
that
of
correcting
the
freaks
of
fortune
at
games
of
chance
i
did
not
wait
to
see
the
onslaught
of
the
cheats
on
the
dupes
but
took
my
leave
while
the
table
was
being
made
ready
such
was
my
life
during
the
seven
months
which
i
spent
at
florence
after
this
dinner
i
never
saw
zen
or
medini
or
zanovitch
except
by
chance
in
the
public
places
here
i
must
recount
some
incidents
which
took
place
towards
the
middle
of
december
lord
lincoln
a
young
man
of
eighteen
fell
in
love
with
a
venetian
dancer
named
lamberti
who
was
a
universal
favourite
on
every
night
when
the
opera
was
given
the
young
englishman
might
be
seen
going
to
her
camerino
and
everyone
wondered
why
he
did
not
visit
her
at
her
own
house
where
he
would
be
certain
of
a
good
welcome
for
he
was
english
and
therefore
rich
young
and
handsome
i
believe
he
was
the
only
son
of
the
duke
of
newcastle
zanovitch
marked
him
down
and
in
a
short
time
had
become
an
intimate
friend
of
the
fair
lamberti
he
then
made
up
to
lord
lincoln
and
took
him
to
the
lady
house
as
a
polite
man
takes
a
friend
to
see
his
mistress
madame
lamberti
who
was
in
collusion
with
the
rascal
was
not
niggardly
of
her
favours
with
the
young
englishman
she
received
him
every
night
to
supper
with
zanovitch
and
zen
who
had
been
presented
by
the
sclav
either
because
of
his
capital
or
because
zanovitch
was
not
so
accomplished
a
cheat
for
the
first
few
nights
they
took
care
to
let
the
young
nobleman
win
as
they
played
after
supper
and
lord
lincoln
followed
the
noble
english
custom
of
drinking
till
he
did
not
know
his
right
hand
from
his
left
he
was
quite
astonished
on
waking
the
next
morning
to
find
that
luck
had
been
as
kind
to
him
as
love
the
trap
was
baited
the
young
lord
nibbled
and
as
may
be
expected
was
finally
caught
zen
won
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
him
and
zanovitch
lent
him
the
money
by
installments
of
three
and
four
hundred
louis
at
a
time
as
the
englishman
had
promised
his
tutor
not
to
play
on
his
word
of
honour
zanovitch
won
from
zen
what
zen
won
from
the
lord
and
so
the
game
was
kept
up
till
the
young
pigeon
had
lost
the
enormous
sum
of
twelve
thousand
guineas
lord
lincoln
promised
to
pay
three
thousand
guineas
the
next
day
and
signed
three
bills
of
exchange
for
three
thousand
guineas
each
payable
in
six
months
and
drawn
on
his
london
banker
i
heard
all
about
this
from
lord
lincoln
himself
when
we
met
at
bologna
three
months
later
the
next
morning
the
little
gaming
party
was
the
talk
of
florence
sasso
sassi
the
banker
had
already
paid
zanovitch
six
thousand
sequins
by
my
lord
orders
medini
came
to
see
me
furious
at
not
having
been
asked
to
join
the
party
while
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
absence
my
surprise
may
be
imagined
when
a
few
days
after
a
person
came
up
to
my
room
and
ordered
me
to
leave
florence
in
three
days
and
tuscany
in
a
week
i
was
petrified
and
called
to
my
landlord
to
witness
the
unrighteous
order
i
had
received
it
was
december
on
the
same
date
three
years
before
i
had
received
orders
to
leave
barcelona
in
three
days
i
dressed
hastily
and
went
to
the
magistrate
to
enquire
the
reason
for
my
exile
and
on
entering
the
room
i
found
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
ordered
me
to
leave
florence
eleven
years
before
i
asked
him
to
give
me
his
reasons
and
he
replied
coldly
that
such
was
the
will
of
his
highness
but
as
his
highness
must
have
his
reasons
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
within
my
rights
in
enquiring
what
they
are
if
you
think
so
you
had
better
betake
yourself
to
the
prince
i
know
nothing
about
it
he
left
yesterday
for
pisa
where
he
will
stay
three
days
you
can
go
there
will
he
pay
for
my
journey
i
should
doubt
it
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
i
shall
not
go
to
pisa
but
i
will
write
to
his
highness
if
you
will
promise
to
send
on
the
letter
i
will
do
so
immediately
for
it
is
my
duty
very
good
you
shall
have
the
letter
before
noon
tomorrow
and
before
i
shall
be
in
the
states
of
the
church
there
no
need
for
you
to
hurry
yourself
there
is
a
very
great
hurry
i
can
not
breathe
the
air
of
a
country
where
liberty
is
unknown
and
the
sovereign
breaks
his
word
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
write
to
your
master
as
i
was
going
out
i
met
medini
who
had
come
on
the
same
business
as
myself
i
laughed
and
informed
him
of
the
results
of
my
interview
and
how
i
had
been
told
to
go
to
pisa
what
have
you
been
expelled
too
yes
what
have
you
done
nothing
nor
i
let
us
go
to
pisa
you
can
go
if
you
like
but
i
shall
leave
florence
tonight
when
i
got
home
i
told
my
landlord
to
get
me
a
carriage
and
to
order
four
for
nightfall
and
i
then
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
grand
duke
my
lord
the
thunder
which
jove
has
placed
in
your
hands
is
only
for
the
guilty
in
launching
it
at
me
you
have
done
wrong
seven
months
ago
you
promised
that
i
should
remain
unmolested
so
long
as
i
obeyed
the
laws
i
have
done
so
scrupulously
and
your
lordship
has
therefore
broken
your
word
i
am
merely
writing
to
you
to
let
you
know
that
i
forgive
you
and
that
i
shall
never
give
utterance
to
a
word
of
complaint
indeed
i
would
willingly
forget
the
injury
you
have
done
me
if
it
were
not
necessary
that
i
should
remember
never
to
set
foot
in
your
realms
again
the
magistrate
tells
me
that
i
can
go
and
see
you
at
pisa
but
i
fear
such
a
step
would
seem
a
hardy
one
to
a
prince
who
should
hear
what
a
man
has
to
say
before
he
condemns
him
and
not
afterwards
i
am
etc
when
i
had
finished
the
letter
i
sent
it
to
the
magistrate
and
then
i
began
my
packing
i
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
when
medini
came
in
cursing
zen
and
zanovitch
whom
he
accused
of
being
the
authors
of
his
misfortune
and
of
refusing
to
give
him
a
hundred
sequins
without
which
he
could
not
possibly
go
we
are
all
going
to
pisa
said
he
and
can
not
imagine
why
you
do
not
come
too
very
good
i
said
laughingly
but
please
to
leave
me
now
as
i
have
to
do
my
packing
as
i
expected
he
wanted
me
to
lend
him
some
money
but
on
my
giving
him
a
direct
refusal
he
went
away
after
dinner
i
took
leave
of
medici
and
madame
dennis
the
latter
of
whom
had
heard
the
story
already
she
cursed
the
grand
duke
saying
she
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
confound
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
she
informed
me
that
madame
lamberti
had
received
orders
to
quit
as
also
a
hunchbacked
venetian
priest
who
used
to
go
and
see
the
dancer
but
had
never
supped
with
her
in
fact
there
was
a
clean
sweep
of
all
the
venetians
in
florence
as
i
was
returning
home
i
met
lord
lincoln
governor
whom
i
had
known
at
lausanne
eleven
years
before
i
told
him
of
what
had
happened
to
me
through
his
hopeful
pupil
getting
himself
fleeced
he
laughed
and
told
me
that
the
grand
duke
had
advised
lord
lincoln
not
to
pay
the
money
he
had
lost
to
which
the
young
man
replied
that
if
he
were
not
to
pay
he
should
be
dishonoured
since
the
money
he
had
lost
had
been
lent
to
him
in
leaving
florence
i
was
cured
of
an
unhappy
love
which
would
doubtless
have
had
fatal
consequences
if
i
had
stayed
on
i
have
spared
my
readers
the
painful
story
because
i
can
not
recall
it
to
my
mind
even
now
without
being
cut
to
the
heart
the
widow
whom
i
loved
and
to
whom
i
was
so
weak
as
to
disclose
my
feelings
only
attached
me
to
her
triumphal
car
to
humiliate
me
for
she
disdained
my
love
and
myself
i
persisted
in
my
courtship
and
nothing
but
my
enforced
absence
would
have
cured
me
as
yet
i
have
not
learnt
the
truth
of
the
maxim
that
old
age
especially
when
devoid
of
fortune
is
not
likely
to
prove
attractive
to
youth
i
left
florence
poorer
by
a
hundred
sequins
than
when
i
came
there
i
had
lived
with
the
most
careful
economy
throughout
the
whole
of
my
stay
i
stopped
at
the
first
stage
within
the
pope
dominions
and
by
the
last
day
but
one
of
the
year
i
was
settled
at
bologna
at
mark
hotel
my
first
visit
was
paid
to
count
marulli
the
florentine
charge
i
begged
him
to
write
and
tell
his
master
that
out
of
gratitude
for
my
banishment
i
should
never
cease
to
sing
his
praises
as
the
count
had
received
a
letter
containing
an
account
of
the
whole
affair
he
could
not
quite
believe
that
i
meant
what
i
said
you
may
think
what
you
like
i
observed
but
if
you
knew
all
you
would
see
that
his
highness
has
done
me
a
very
great
service
though
quite
unintentionally
he
promised
to
let
his
master
know
how
i
spoke
of
him
on
january
i
presented
myself
to
cardinal
braneaforte
the
pope
legate
whom
i
had
known
twenty
years
before
at
paris
when
he
had
been
sent
by
benedict
xvi
with
the
holy
swaddling
clothes
for
the
duke
of
burgundy
we
had
met
at
the
lodge
of
freemasons
for
the
members
of
the
sacred
college
were
by
no
means
afraid
of
their
own
anathemas
we
had
also
some
very
pleasant
little
suppers
with
pretty
sinners
in
company
with
don
francesco
sensate
and
count
ranucci
in
short
the
cardinal
was
a
man
of
wit
and
what
is
called
a
bon
vivant
oh
here
you
are
cried
he
when
he
saw
me
i
was
expecting
you
how
could
you
my
lord
why
should
i
have
come
to
bologna
rather
than
to
any
other
place
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
bologna
is
better
than
many
other
places
and
besides
i
flatter
myself
you
thought
of
me
but
you
need
say
anything
here
about
the
life
we
led
together
when
we
were
young
men
it
has
always
been
a
pleasant
recollection
to
me
no
doubt
count
marulli
told
me
yesterday
that
you
spoke
very
highly
of
the
grand
duke
and
you
are
quite
right
you
can
talk
to
me
in
confidence
the
walls
of
this
room
have
no
ears
how
much
did
you
get
of
the
twelve
thousand
guineas
i
told
him
the
whole
story
and
shewed
him
a
copy
of
the
letter
which
i
had
written
to
the
grand
duke
he
laughed
and
said
he
was
sorry
i
had
been
punished
for
nothing
when
he
heard
i
thought
of
staying
some
months
at
bologna
he
told
me
that
i
might
reckon
on
perfect
freedom
and
that
as
soon
as
the
matter
ceased
to
become
common
talk
he
would
give
me
open
proof
of
his
friendship
after
seeing
the
cardinal
i
resolved
to
continue
at
bologna
the
kind
of
life
that
i
had
been
leading
at
florence
bologna
is
the
freest
town
in
all
italy
commodities
are
cheap
and
good
and
all
the
pleasures
of
life
may
be
had
there
at
a
low
price
the
town
is
a
fine
one
and
the
streets
are
lined
with
arcades
a
great
comfort
in
so
hot
a
place
as
to
society
i
did
not
trouble
myself
about
it
i
knew
the
bolognese
the
nobles
are
proud
rude
and
violent
the
lowest
orders
known
as
the
birichini
are
worse
than
the
lazzaroni
of
naples
while
the
tradesmen
and
the
middle
classes
are
generally
speaking
worthy
and
respectable
people
at
bologna
as
at
naples
the
two
extremes
of
society
are
corrupt
while
the
middle
classes
are
respectable
and
the
depository
of
virtue
talents
and
learning
however
my
intention
was
to
leave
society
alone
to
pass
my
time
in
study
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
few
men
of
letters
who
are
easily
accessible
everywhere
at
florence
ignorance
is
the
rule
and
learning
the
exception
while
at
bologna
the
tincture
of
letters
is
almost
universal
the
university
has
thrice
the
usual
number
of
professors
but
they
are
all
ill
paid
and
have
to
get
their
living
out
of
the
students
who
are
numerous
printing
is
cheaper
at
bologna
than
anywhere
else
and
though
the
inquisition
is
established
there
the
press
is
almost
entirely
free
all
the
exiles
from
florence
reached
bologna
four
or
five
days
after
myself
madame
lamberti
only
passed
through
on
her
way
to
venice
zanovitch
and
zen
stayed
five
or
six
days
but
they
were
no
longer
in
partnership
having
quarreled
over
the
sharing
of
the
booty
zanovitch
had
refused
to
make
one
of
lord
lincoln
bills
of
exchange
payable
to
zen
because
he
did
not
wish
to
make
himself
liable
in
case
the
englishman
refused
to
pay
he
wanted
to
go
to
england
and
told
zen
he
was
at
liberty
to
do
the
same
they
went
to
milan
without
having
patched
up
their
quarrel
but
the
milanese
government
ordered
them
to
leave
lombardy
and
i
never
heard
what
arrangements
they
finally
came
to
later
on
i
was
informed
that
the
englishman
bills
had
all
been
settled
to
the
uttermost
farthing
medini
penniless
as
usual
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
the
hotel
where
i
was
staying
bringing
with
him
his
mistress
her
sister
and
her
mother
but
with
only
one
servant
he
informed
me
that
the
grand
duke
had
refused
to
listen
to
any
of
them
at
pisa
where
he
had
received
a
second
order
to
leave
tuscany
and
so
had
been
obliged
to
sell
everything
of
course
he
wanted
me
to
help
him
but
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
entreaties
i
have
never
seen
this
adventurer
without
his
being
in
a
desperate
state
of
impecuniosity
but
he
would
never
learn
to
abate
his
luxurious
habits
and
always
managed
to
find
some
way
or
other
out
of
his
difficulties
he
was
lucky
enough
to
fall
in
with
a
franciscan
monk
named
de
dominis
at
bologna
the
said
monk
being
on
his
way
to
rome
to
solicit
a
brief
of
from
the
pope
he
fell
in
love
with
medini
mistress
who
naturally
made
him
pay
dearly
for
her
charms
medini
left
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
he
went
to
germany
where
he
printed
his
version
of
the
henriade
having
discovered
a
maecenas
in
the
person
of
the
elector
palatin
after
that
he
wandered
about
europe
for
twelve
years
and
died
in
a
london
prison
in
i
had
always
warned
him
to
give
england
a
wide
berth
as
i
felt
certain
that
if
he
once
went
there
he
would
not
escape
english
bolts
and
bars
and
that
if
he
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
prison
doors
he
would
never
come
out
alive
he
despised
my
advice
and
if
he
did
so
with
the
idea
of
proving
me
a
liar
he
made
a
mistake
for
he
proved
me
to
be
a
prophet
medini
had
the
advantage
of
high
birth
a
good
education
and
intelligence
but
as
he
was
a
poor
man
with
luxurious
tastes
he
either
corrected
fortune
at
play
or
went
into
debt
and
was
consequently
obliged
to
be
always
on
the
wing
to
avoid
imprisonment
he
lived
in
this
way
for
seventy
years
and
he
might
possibly
be
alive
now
if
he
had
followed
my
advice
eight
years
ago
count
torio
told
me
that
he
had
seen
medini
in
a
london
prison
and
that
the
silly
fellow
confessed
he
had
only
come
to
london
with
the
hope
of
proving
me
to
be
a
liar
medini
fate
shall
never
prevent
me
from
giving
good
advice
to
a
poor
wretch
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
twenty
years
ago
i
told
cagliostro
who
called
himself
count
pellegrini
in
those
days
not
to
set
his
foot
in
rome
and
if
he
had
followed
this
counsel
he
would
not
have
died
miserably
in
a
roman
prison
thirty
years
ago
a
wise
man
advised
me
to
beware
visiting
spain
i
went
but
as
the
reader
knows
i
had
no
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
my
visit
a
week
after
my
arrival
at
bologna
happening
to
be
in
the
shop
of
tartuffi
the
bookseller
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
priest
who
struck
me
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
talk
as
a
man
of
learning
and
talent
he
presented
me
with
two
works
which
had
recently
been
issued
by
two
of
the
young
professors
at
the
university
he
told
me
that
i
should
find
them
amusing
reading
and
he
was
right
the
first
treatise
contended
that
women
faults
should
be
forgiven
them
since
they
were
really
the
work
of
the
matrix
which
influenced
them
in
spite
of
themselves
the
second
treatise
was
a
criticism
of
the
first
the
author
allowed
that
the
uterus
was
an
animal
but
he
denied
the
alleged
influence
as
no
anatomist
had
succeeded
in
discovering
any
communication
between
it
and
the
brain
i
determined
to
write
a
reply
to
the
two
pamphlets
and
i
did
so
in
the
course
of
three
days
when
my
reply
was
finished
i
sent
it
to
dandolo
instructing
him
to
have
five
hundred
copies
printed
when
they
arrived
i
gave
a
bookseller
the
agency
and
in
a
fortnight
i
had
made
a
hundred
sequins
the
first
pamphlet
was
called
lutero
pensante
the
second
was
in
french
and
bore
the
title
la
force
vitale
while
i
called
my
reply
lana
caprina
i
treated
the
matter
in
an
easy
vein
not
without
some
hints
of
deep
learning
and
made
fun
of
the
lucubrations
of
the
two
physicians
my
preface
was
in
french
but
full
of
parisian
idioms
which
rendered
it
unintelligible
to
all
who
had
not
visited
the
gay
capital
and
this
circumstance
gained
me
a
good
many
friends
amongst
the
younger
generation
the
squinting
priest
whose
name
was
zacchierdi
introduced
me
to
the
abbe
severini
who
became
my
intimate
friend
in
the
course
of
ten
or
twelve
days
this
abbe
made
me
leave
the
inn
and
got
me
two
pleasant
rooms
in
the
house
of
a
retired
artiste
the
widow
of
the
tenor
carlani
he
also
made
arrangements
with
a
pastrycook
to
send
me
my
dinner
and
supper
all
this
plus
a
servant
only
cost
me
ten
sequins
a
month
severini
was
the
agreeable
cause
of
my
losing
temporarily
my
taste
for
study
i
put
by
my
iliad
feeling
sure
that
i
should
be
able
to
finish
it
again
severini
introduced
me
to
his
family
and
before
long
i
became
very
intimate
with
him
i
also
became
the
favourite
of
his
sister
a
lady
rather
plain
than
pretty
thirty
years
old
but
full
of
intelligence
in
the
course
of
lent
the
abbe
introduced
me
to
all
the
best
dancers
and
operatic
singers
in
bologna
which
is
the
nursery
of
the
heroines
of
the
stage
they
may
be
had
cheaply
enough
on
their
native
soil
every
week
the
good
abbe
introduced
me
to
a
fresh
one
and
like
a
true
friend
he
watched
carefully
over
my
finances
he
was
a
poor
man
himself
and
could
not
afford
to
contribute
anything
towards
the
expenses
of
our
little
parties
but
as
they
would
have
cost
me
double
without
his
help
the
arrangement
was
a
convenient
one
for
both
of
us
about
this
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
a
bolognese
nobleman
marquis
albergati
capacelli
he
had
made
a
present
of
his
private
theatre
to
the
public
and
was
himself
an
excellent
actor
he
had
made
himself
notorious
by
obtaining
a
divorce
from
his
wife
whom
he
did
not
like
so
as
to
enable
him
to
marry
a
dancer
by
whom
he
had
two
children
the
amusing
point
in
this
divorce
was
that
he
obtained
it
on
the
plea
that
he
was
impotent
and
sustained
his
plea
by
submitting
to
an
examination
which
was
conducted
as
follows
four
skilled
and
impartial
judges
had
the
marquis
stripped
before
them
and
did
all
in
their
power
to
produce
an
erection
but
somehow
or
other
he
succeeded
in
maintaining
his
composure
and
the
marriage
was
pronounced
null
and
void
on
the
ground
of
relative
impotence
for
it
was
well
known
that
he
had
had
children
by
another
woman
if
reason
and
not
prejudice
had
been
consulted
the
procedure
would
have
been
very
different
for
if
relative
impotence
was
considered
a
sufficient
ground
for
divorce
of
what
use
was
the
examination
the
marquis
should
have
sworn
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
his
wife
and
if
the
lady
had
traversed
this
statement
the
marquis
might
have
challenged
her
to
put
him
into
the
required
condition
but
the
destruction
of
old
customs
and
old
prejudices
is
often
the
work
of
long
ages
i
felt
curious
to
know
this
character
and
wrote
to
dandolo
to
get
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
marquis
in
a
week
my
good
old
friend
sent
me
the
desired
letter
it
was
written
by
another
venetian
de
zaguri
an
intimate
friend
of
the
marquis
the
letter
was
not
sealed
so
i
read
it
i
was
delighted
no
one
could
have
commended
a
person
unknown
to
himself
but
the
friend
of
a
friend
in
a
more
delicate
manner
i
thought
myself
bound
to
write
a
letter
of
thanks
to
zaguri
i
said
that
i
desired
to
obtain
my
pardon
more
than
ever
after
reading
his
letter
which
made
me
long
to
go
to
venice
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
worthy
nobleman
i
did
not
expect
an
answer
but
i
got
one
zaguri
said
that
my
desire
was
such
a
flattering
one
to
himself
that
he
meant
to
do
his
best
to
obtain
my
recall
the
reader
will
see
that
he
was
successful
but
not
till
after
two
years
of
continuous
effort
albergati
was
away
from
bologna
at
the
time
but
when
he
returned
severini
let
me
know
and
i
called
at
the
palace
the
porter
told
me
that
his
excellence
all
the
nobles
are
excellences
at
bologna
had
gone
to
his
country
house
where
he
meant
to
pass
the
whole
of
the
spring
in
two
or
three
days
i
drove
out
to
his
villa
i
arrived
at
a
charming
mansion
and
finding
no
one
at
the
door
i
went
upstairs
and
entered
a
large
room
where
a
gentleman
and
an
exceedingly
pretty
woman
were
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
the
dishes
had
been
brought
in
and
there
were
only
two
places
laid
i
made
a
polite
bow
and
asked
the
gentleman
if
i
had
the
honour
of
addressing
the
marquis
albergati
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
whereupon
i
gave
him
my
letter
of
introduction
he
took
it
read
the
superscription
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
telling
me
i
was
very
kind
to
have
taken
so
much
trouble
and
that
he
would
be
sure
to
read
it
it
has
been
no
trouble
at
all
i
replied
but
i
hope
you
will
read
the
letter
it
is
written
by
de
zaguri
whom
i
asked
to
do
me
this
service
as
i
have
long
desired
to
make
your
lordship
acquaintance
his
lordship
smiled
and
said
very
pleasantly
that
he
would
read
it
after
dinner
and
would
see
what
he
could
do
for
his
friend
zaguri
our
dialogue
was
over
in
a
few
seconds
thinking
him
extremely
rude
i
turned
my
back
and
went
downstairs
arriving
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
postillion
taking
out
the
horses
i
promised
him
a
double
gratuity
if
he
would
take
me
to
some
village
at
hand
where
he
could
bait
his
horses
while
i
breakfasted
just
as
the
postillion
had
got
on
horseback
a
servant
came
running
up
he
told
me
very
politely
that
his
excellence
begged
me
to
step
upstairs
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
gave
the
man
my
card
with
my
name
and
address
and
telling
him
that
that
was
what
his
master
wanted
i
ordered
the
postillion
to
drive
off
at
a
full
gallop
when
we
had
gone
half
a
league
we
stopped
at
a
good
inn
and
then
proceeded
on
our
way
back
to
bologna
the
same
day
i
wrote
to
de
zaguri
and
described
the
welcome
i
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
marquis
i
enclosed
the
letter
in
another
to
dandolo
begging
him
to
read
it
and
to
send
it
on
i
begged
the
noble
venetian
to
write
to
the
marquis
that
having
offended
me
grievously
he
must
prepare
to
give
me
due
satisfaction
i
laughed
with
all
my
heart
next
day
when
my
landlady
gave
me
a
visiting
card
with
the
inscription
general
the
marquis
of
albeygati
she
told
me
the
marquis
had
called
on
me
himself
and
on
hearing
i
was
out
had
left
his
card
i
began
to
look
upon
the
whole
of
his
proceedings
as
pure
gasconnade
only
lacking
the
wit
of
the
true
gascon
i
determined
to
await
zaguri
reply
before
making
up
my
mind
as
to
the
kind
of
satisfaction
i
should
demand
while
i
was
inspecting
the
card
and
wondering
what
right
the
marquis
had
to
the
title
of
general
severini
came
in
and
informed
me
that
the
marquis
had
been
made
a
knight
of
the
order
of
stanislas
by
the
king
of
poland
who
had
also
given
him
the
style
of
royal
chamberlain
is
he
a
general
in
the
polish
service
as
well
i
asked
i
really
do
know
i
understand
it
all
i
said
to
myself
in
poland
a
chamberlain
has
the
rank
of
and
the
marquis
calls
himself
general
but
general
what
the
adjective
without
a
substantive
is
a
mere
cheat
i
saw
my
opportunity
and
wrote
a
comic
dialogue
which
i
had
printed
the
next
day
i
made
a
present
of
the
work
to
a
bookseller
and
in
three
or
four
days
he
sold
out
the
whole
edition
at
a
bajocco
apiece
chapter
xix
farinello
and
the
electress
dowager
of
saxony
madame
slopitz
nina
the
midwife
madame
soavi
abbe
bolini
madame
viscioletta
the
seamstress
the
sorry
pleasure
of
revenge
severini
goes
to
naples
my
departure
marquis
mosca
anyone
who
attacks
a
proud
person
in
a
comic
vein
is
almost
sure
of
success
the
laugh
is
generally
on
his
side
i
asked
in
my
dialogue
whether
it
was
lawful
for
a
to
call
himself
simply
marshal
and
whether
a
had
a
right
to
the
title
of
colonel
i
also
asked
whether
the
man
who
preferred
titles
of
honour
for
which
he
had
paid
in
hard
cash
to
his
ancient
and
legitimate
rank
could
pass
for
a
sage
of
course
the
marquis
had
to
laugh
at
my
dialogue
but
he
was
called
the
general
ever
after
he
had
placed
the
royal
arms
of
poland
over
the
gate
of
his
palace
much
to
the
amusement
of
count
mischinski
the
polish
ambassador
to
berlin
who
happened
to
be
passing
through
bologna
at
that
time
i
told
the
pole
of
my
dispute
with
the
mad
marquis
and
persuaded
him
to
pay
albergati
a
visit
leaving
his
card
the
ambassador
did
so
and
the
call
was
returned
but
albergati
cards
no
longer
bore
the
title
of
general
the
dowager
electress
of
saxony
having
come
to
bologna
i
hastened
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
she
had
only
come
to
see
the
famous
castrato
farinello
who
had
left
madrid
and
now
lived
at
bologna
in
great
comfort
he
placed
a
magnificent
collation
before
the
electress
and
sang
a
song
of
his
own
composition
accompanying
himself
on
the
piano
the
electress
who
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
embraced
farinello
exclaiming
now
i
can
die
happy
farinello
who
was
also
known
as
the
chevalier
borschi
had
reigned
as
it
were
in
spain
till
the
parmese
wife
of
philip
had
laid
plots
which
obliged
him
to
leave
the
court
after
the
disgrace
of
enunada
the
electress
noticed
a
portrait
of
the
queen
and
spoke
very
highly
of
her
mentioning
some
circumstances
which
must
have
taken
place
in
the
reign
of
ferdinand
vi
the
famous
musician
burst
into
tears
and
said
that
queen
barbara
was
as
good
as
elizabeth
of
parma
was
wicked
borschi
might
have
been
seventy
when
i
saw
him
at
bologna
he
was
very
rich
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
good
health
and
yet
he
was
unhappy
continually
shedding
tears
at
the
thought
of
spain
ambition
is
a
more
powerful
passion
than
avarice
besides
farinello
had
another
reason
for
unhappiness
he
had
a
nephew
who
was
the
heir
to
all
his
wealth
whom
he
married
to
a
noble
tuscan
lady
hoping
to
found
a
titled
family
though
in
an
indirect
kind
of
way
but
this
marriage
was
a
torment
to
him
for
in
his
impotent
old
age
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
fall
in
love
with
his
niece
and
to
become
jealous
of
his
nephew
worse
than
all
the
lady
grew
to
hate
him
and
farinello
had
sent
his
nephew
abroad
while
he
never
allowed
the
wife
to
go
out
of
his
sight
lord
lincoln
arrived
in
bologna
with
an
introduction
for
the
cardinal
legate
who
asked
him
to
dinner
and
did
me
the
honour
of
giving
me
an
invitation
to
meet
him
the
cardinal
was
thus
convinced
that
lord
lincoln
and
i
had
never
met
and
that
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
had
committed
a
great
injustice
in
banishing
me
it
was
on
that
occasion
that
the
young
nobleman
told
me
how
they
had
spread
the
snare
though
he
denied
that
he
had
been
cheated
he
was
far
too
proud
to
acknowledge
such
a
thing
he
died
of
debauchery
in
london
three
or
four
years
after
i
also
saw
at
bologna
the
englishman
aston
with
madame
slopitz
sister
of
the
charming
cailimena
madame
slopitz
was
much
handsomer
than
her
sister
she
had
presented
aston
with
two
babes
as
beautiful
as
cherubs
i
spoke
of
her
sister
to
her
and
from
the
way
in
which
i
sang
her
praises
she
guessed
that
i
had
loved
her
she
told
me
she
would
be
in
florence
during
the
carnival
of
but
i
did
not
see
her
again
till
the
year
when
i
was
at
venice
the
dreadful
nina
bergonci
who
had
made
a
madman
of
count
ricla
and
was
the
source
of
all
my
woes
at
barcelona
had
come
to
bologna
at
the
beginning
of
lent
occupying
a
pleasant
house
which
she
had
taken
she
had
carte
blanche
with
a
banker
and
kept
up
a
great
state
affirming
herself
to
be
with
child
by
the
viceroy
of
catalonia
and
demanding
the
honours
which
would
be
given
to
a
queen
who
had
graciously
chosen
bologna
as
the
place
of
her
confinement
she
had
a
special
recommendation
to
the
legate
who
often
visited
her
but
in
the
greatest
secrecy
the
time
of
her
confinement
approached
and
the
insane
ricla
sent
over
a
confidential
man
don
martino
who
was
empowered
to
have
the
child
baptized
and
to
recognize
it
as
ricla
natural
offspring
nina
made
a
show
of
her
condition
appearing
at
the
theatre
and
in
the
public
places
with
an
enormous
belly
the
greatest
noble
of
bologna
paid
court
to
her
and
nina
told
them
that
they
might
do
so
but
that
she
could
not
guarantee
their
safety
from
the
jealous
dagger
of
ricla
she
was
impudent
enough
to
tell
them
what
happened
to
me
at
barcelona
not
knowing
that
i
was
at
bologna
she
was
extremely
surprised
to
hear
from
count
zini
who
knew
me
that
i
inhabited
the
same
town
as
herself
when
the
count
met
me
he
asked
me
if
the
barcelona
story
was
true
i
did
not
care
to
take
him
into
my
confidence
so
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
nina
and
that
the
story
had
doubtless
been
made
up
by
her
to
see
whether
he
would
encounter
danger
for
her
sake
when
i
met
the
cardinal
i
told
him
the
whole
story
and
his
eminence
was
astonished
when
i
gave
him
some
insight
into
nina
character
and
informed
him
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
her
sister
and
her
grandfather
i
could
stake
my
life
said
i
that
nina
is
no
more
with
child
than
you
are
oh
come
said
he
laughing
that
is
really
too
strong
why
she
have
a
child
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
it
seems
to
me
possibly
it
may
not
be
ricla
child
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
she
is
with
somebody
child
what
object
could
she
have
for
feigning
pregnancy
to
make
herself
famous
by
defiling
the
count
de
ricla
who
was
a
model
of
justice
and
virtue
before
knowing
this
messalina
if
your
eminence
knew
the
hideous
character
of
nina
you
would
not
wonder
at
anything
she
did
well
we
shall
see
yes
about
a
week
later
i
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
street
and
on
putting
my
head
out
of
the
window
i
saw
a
woman
stripped
to
the
waist
and
mounted
on
an
ass
being
scourged
by
the
hangman
and
hooted
by
a
mob
of
all
the
biricchini
in
bologna
severini
came
up
at
the
same
moment
and
informed
me
that
the
woman
was
the
chief
midwife
in
bologna
and
that
her
punishment
had
been
ordered
by
the
cardinal
archbishop
it
must
be
for
some
great
crime
i
observed
no
doubt
it
is
the
woman
who
was
with
nina
the
day
before
yesterday
what
has
nina
been
brought
to
bed
yes
but
of
a
child
i
see
it
all
next
day
the
story
was
all
over
the
town
a
poor
woman
had
come
before
the
archbishop
and
had
complained
bitterly
that
the
midwife
teresa
had
seduced
her
promising
to
give
her
twenty
sequins
if
she
would
give
her
a
fine
boy
to
whom
she
had
given
birth
a
fortnight
ago
she
was
not
given
the
sum
agreed
upon
and
in
her
despair
at
hearing
of
the
death
of
her
child
she
begged
for
justice
declaring
herself
able
to
prove
that
the
dead
child
said
to
be
nina
was
in
reality
her
own
the
archbishop
ordered
his
chancellor
to
enquire
into
the
affair
with
the
utmost
secrecy
and
then
proceed
to
instant
and
summary
execution
a
week
after
this
scandal
don
martino
returned
to
barcelona
but
nina
remained
as
impudent
as
ever
doubled
the
size
of
the
red
cockades
which
she
made
her
servants
wear
and
swore
that
spain
would
avenge
her
on
the
insolent
archbishop
she
remained
at
bologna
six
weeks
longer
pretending
to
be
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
her
confinement
the
cardinal
legate
who
was
ashamed
of
having
had
anything
to
do
with
such
an
abandoned
prostitute
did
his
best
to
have
her
ordered
to
leave
count
ricla
a
dupe
to
the
last
gave
her
a
considerable
yearly
income
on
the
condition
that
she
should
never
come
to
barcelona
again
but
in
a
year
the
count
died
nina
did
not
survive
him
for
more
than
a
year
and
died
miserably
from
her
fearful
debauchery
i
met
her
mother
and
sister
at
venice
and
she
told
me
the
story
of
the
last
two
years
of
her
daughter
life
but
it
is
so
sad
and
so
disgusting
a
tale
that
i
feel
obliged
to
omit
it
as
for
the
infamous
midwife
she
found
powerful
friends
a
pamphlet
appeared
in
which
the
anonymous
author
declared
that
the
archbishop
had
committed
a
great
wrong
in
punishing
a
citizen
in
so
shameful
a
manner
without
any
of
the
proper
formalities
of
justice
the
writer
maintained
that
even
if
she
were
guilty
she
had
been
unjustly
punished
and
should
appeal
to
rome
the
prelate
feeling
the
force
of
these
animadversions
circulated
a
pamphlet
in
which
it
appeared
that
the
midwife
had
made
three
prior
appearances
before
the
judge
and
that
she
would
have
been
sent
to
the
gallows
long
ago
if
the
archbishop
had
not
hesitated
to
shame
three
of
the
noblest
families
in
bologna
whose
names
appeared
in
documents
in
the
custody
of
his
chancellor
her
crimes
were
procuring
abortion
and
killing
erring
mothers
substituting
the
living
for
the
dead
and
in
one
case
a
boy
for
a
girl
thus
giving
him
the
enjoyment
of
property
which
did
not
belong
to
him
this
pamphlet
of
the
prelate
reduced
the
patrons
of
the
infamous
midwife
to
silence
for
several
young
noblemen
whose
mothers
had
been
attended
by
her
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
their
family
secrets
being
brought
to
light
at
bologna
i
saw
madame
marucci
who
had
been
expelled
from
spain
for
the
same
reason
as
madame
pelliccia
the
latter
had
retired
to
rome
while
madame
marucci
was
on
her
way
to
lucca
her
native
country
madame
soavi
a
bolognese
dancer
whom
i
had
known
at
parma
and
paris
came
to
bologna
with
her
daughter
by
de
marigni
the
girl
whose
name
was
adelaide
was
very
beautiful
and
her
natural
abilities
had
been
fostered
by
a
careful
education
when
madame
soavi
got
to
bologna
she
met
her
husband
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
fifteen
years
here
is
a
treasure
for
you
said
she
shewing
him
her
daughter
she
certainly
very
pretty
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
she
does
not
belong
to
me
yes
she
does
as
i
have
given
her
to
you
you
must
know
that
she
has
six
thousand
francs
a
year
and
that
i
shall
be
her
cashier
till
i
get
her
married
to
a
good
dancer
i
want
her
to
learn
character
dancing
and
to
make
her
appearance
on
the
boards
you
must
take
her
out
on
holidays
what
shall
i
say
if
people
ask
me
who
she
is
say
she
is
your
daughter
and
that
you
are
certain
because
your
wife
gave
her
to
you
i
ca
see
that
ah
you
have
always
stayed
at
home
and
consequently
your
wits
are
homely
i
heard
this
curious
dialogue
which
made
me
laugh
then
and
makes
me
laugh
now
as
i
write
it
i
offered
to
help
in
adelaide
education
but
madame
soavi
laughed
and
said
fox
you
have
deceived
so
many
tender
pullets
that
i
do
like
to
trust
you
with
this
one
for
fear
of
your
making
her
too
precocious
i
did
not
think
of
that
but
you
are
right
adelaide
became
the
wonder
of
bologna
a
year
after
i
left
the
comte
du
barri
of
the
famous
mistress
of
louis
visited
bologna
and
became
so
amorous
of
adelaide
that
her
mother
sent
her
away
fearing
he
would
carry
her
off
du
barri
offered
her
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
the
girl
but
she
refused
the
offer
i
saw
adelaide
five
years
later
on
the
boards
of
a
venetian
theatre
when
i
went
to
congratulate
her
she
said
my
mother
brought
me
into
the
world
and
i
think
she
will
send
me
out
of
it
this
dancing
is
killing
me
in
point
of
fact
this
delicate
flower
faded
and
died
after
seven
years
of
the
severe
life
to
which
her
mother
had
exposed
her
madame
soavi
who
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
settle
the
six
thousand
francs
on
herself
lost
all
in
losing
adelaide
and
died
miserably
after
having
rolled
in
riches
but
alas
i
am
not
the
man
to
reproach
anyone
on
the
score
of
imprudence
at
bologna
i
met
the
famous
afflisio
who
had
been
discharged
from
the
imperial
service
and
had
turned
manager
he
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
five
or
six
years
later
committed
forgery
was
sent
to
the
galleys
and
there
died
i
was
also
impressed
by
the
example
of
a
man
of
a
good
family
who
had
once
been
rich
this
was
count
filomarino
he
was
living
in
great
misery
deprived
of
the
use
of
all
his
limbs
by
a
succession
of
venereal
complaints
i
often
went
to
see
him
to
give
him
a
few
pieces
of
money
and
to
listen
to
his
malevolent
talk
for
his
tongue
was
the
only
member
that
continued
active
he
was
a
scoundrel
and
a
slanderer
and
writhed
under
the
thought
that
he
could
not
go
to
naples
and
torment
his
relations
who
were
in
reality
respectable
people
but
monsters
according
to
his
shewing
madame
sabatini
the
dancer
had
returned
to
bologna
having
made
enough
money
to
rest
upon
her
laurels
she
married
a
professor
of
anatomy
and
brought
all
her
wealth
to
him
as
a
dower
she
had
with
her
her
sister
who
was
not
rich
and
had
no
talents
but
was
at
the
same
time
very
agreeable
at
the
house
i
met
an
abbe
a
fine
young
man
of
modest
appearance
the
sister
seemed
to
be
deeply
in
love
with
him
while
he
appeared
to
be
grateful
and
nothing
more
i
made
some
remark
to
the
modest
adonis
and
he
gave
me
a
very
sensible
answer
we
walked
away
together
and
after
telling
each
other
what
brought
us
to
bologna
we
parted
agreeing
to
meet
again
the
abbe
who
was
or
years
old
was
not
in
orders
and
was
the
only
son
of
a
noble
family
of
novara
which
was
unfortunately
poor
as
well
as
noble
he
had
a
very
scanty
revenue
and
was
able
to
live
more
cheaply
at
bologna
than
novara
where
everything
is
dear
besides
he
did
not
care
for
his
relations
he
had
no
friends
and
everybody
there
was
more
or
less
ignorant
the
abbe
de
bolini
as
he
was
called
was
a
man
of
tranquil
mind
living
a
peaceful
and
quiet
life
above
all
things
he
liked
lettered
men
more
than
letters
and
did
not
trouble
to
gain
the
reputation
of
a
wit
he
knew
he
was
not
a
fool
and
when
he
mixed
with
learned
men
he
was
quite
clever
enough
to
be
a
good
listener
both
temperament
and
his
purse
made
him
temperate
in
all
things
and
he
had
received
a
sound
christian
education
he
never
talked
about
religion
but
nothing
scandalized
him
he
seldom
praised
and
never
blamed
he
was
almost
entirely
indifferent
to
women
flying
from
ugly
women
and
blue
stockings
and
gratifying
the
passion
of
pretty
ones
more
out
of
kindliness
than
love
for
in
his
heart
he
considered
women
as
more
likely
to
make
a
man
miserable
than
happy
i
was
especially
interested
in
this
last
characteristic
we
had
been
friends
for
three
weeks
when
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
him
how
he
reconciled
his
theories
with
his
attachment
to
brigida
sabatini
he
supped
with
her
every
evening
and
she
breakfasted
with
him
every
morning
when
i
went
to
see
him
she
was
either
there
already
or
came
in
before
my
call
was
over
she
breathed
forth
love
in
every
glance
while
the
abbe
was
kind
but
in
spite
of
his
politeness
evidently
bored
brigida
looked
well
enough
but
she
was
at
least
ten
years
older
than
the
abbe
she
was
very
polite
to
me
and
did
her
best
to
convince
me
that
the
abbe
was
happy
in
the
possession
of
her
heart
and
that
they
both
enjoyed
the
delights
of
mutual
love
but
when
i
asked
him
over
a
bottle
of
good
wine
about
his
affection
for
brigida
he
sighed
smiled
blushed
looked
down
and
finally
confessed
that
this
connection
was
the
misfortune
of
his
life
misfortune
does
she
make
you
sigh
in
vain
if
so
you
should
leave
her
and
thus
regain
your
happiness
how
can
i
sigh
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
she
is
in
love
with
me
and
tries
to
make
me
her
slave
how
do
you
mean
she
wants
me
to
marry
her
and
i
promised
to
do
so
partly
from
weakness
and
partly
from
pity
and
now
she
is
in
a
hurry
i
daresay
all
these
elderly
girls
are
in
a
hurry
every
evening
she
treats
me
to
tears
supplications
and
despair
she
summons
me
to
keep
my
promise
and
accuses
me
of
deceiving
her
so
you
may
imagine
that
my
situation
is
an
unhappy
one
have
you
any
obligations
towards
her
none
whatever
she
has
violated
me
so
to
speak
for
all
the
advances
came
from
her
she
has
only
what
her
sister
gives
her
from
day
to
day
and
if
she
got
married
she
would
not
get
that
have
you
got
her
with
child
i
have
taken
good
care
not
to
do
so
and
that
what
has
irritated
her
she
calls
all
my
little
stratagems
detestable
treason
nevertheless
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
marry
her
sooner
or
later
i
as
soon
hang
myself
if
i
got
married
to
her
i
should
be
four
times
as
poor
as
i
am
now
and
all
my
relations
at
novara
would
laugh
at
me
for
bringing
home
a
wife
of
her
age
besides
she
is
neither
rich
nor
well
born
and
at
novara
they
demand
the
one
or
the
other
then
as
a
man
of
honour
and
as
a
man
of
sense
you
ought
to
break
with
her
and
the
sooner
the
better
i
know
but
lacking
normal
strength
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
did
not
go
and
sup
with
her
she
would
infallibly
come
after
me
to
see
what
had
happened
i
ca
lock
my
door
in
her
face
and
i
ca
tell
her
to
go
away
no
but
neither
can
go
on
in
this
miserable
way
you
must
make
up
your
mind
and
cut
the
gordian
knot
like
alexander
i
have
his
sword
i
will
lend
it
you
what
do
you
mean
listen
to
me
you
must
go
and
live
in
another
town
she
will
hardly
go
after
you
there
i
suppose
that
is
a
very
good
plan
but
flight
is
a
difficult
matter
difficult
not
at
all
do
you
promise
to
do
what
i
tell
you
and
i
will
arrange
everything
quite
comfortably
your
mistress
will
not
know
anything
about
it
till
she
misses
you
at
supper
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
but
brigida
will
go
mad
with
grief
well
my
first
order
to
you
is
not
to
give
her
grief
a
single
thought
you
have
only
to
leave
everything
to
me
would
you
like
to
start
yes
have
you
any
debts
no
do
you
want
any
money
i
have
sufficient
but
the
idea
of
leaving
tomorrow
has
taken
my
breath
away
i
must
have
three
days
delay
why
so
i
expect
some
letters
the
day
after
and
i
must
write
to
my
relations
to
tell
them
where
i
am
going
i
will
take
charge
of
your
letters
and
send
them
on
to
you
where
shall
i
be
i
will
tell
you
at
the
moment
of
your
departure
trust
in
me
i
will
send
you
at
once
where
you
will
be
comfortable
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
leave
your
trunk
in
the
hands
of
your
landlord
with
orders
not
to
give
it
up
to
anyone
but
myself
very
good
i
am
to
go
without
my
trunk
then
yes
you
must
dine
with
me
every
day
till
you
go
and
mind
not
to
tell
anyone
whatsoever
that
you
intend
leaving
bologna
i
will
take
care
not
to
do
so
the
worthy
young
fellow
looked
quite
radiant
i
embraced
him
and
thanked
him
for
putting
so
much
trust
in
me
i
felt
proud
at
the
good
work
i
was
about
to
perform
and
smiled
at
the
thought
of
brigida
anger
when
she
found
that
her
lover
had
escaped
i
wrote
to
my
good
friend
dandolo
that
in
five
or
six
days
a
young
abbe
would
present
himself
before
him
bearing
a
letter
from
myself
i
begged
dandolo
to
get
him
a
comfortable
and
cheap
lodging
as
my
friend
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
indifferently
provided
with
money
though
an
excellent
man
i
then
wrote
the
letter
of
which
the
abbe
was
to
be
the
bearer
next
day
bolini
told
me
that
brigida
was
far
from
suspecting
his
flight
as
owing
to
his
gaiety
at
the
thought
of
freedom
he
had
contented
her
so
well
during
the
night
she
had
passed
with
him
that
she
thought
him
as
much
in
love
as
she
was
she
has
all
my
linen
he
added
but
i
hope
to
get
a
good
part
of
it
back
under
one
pretext
or
another
and
she
is
welcome
to
the
rest
on
the
day
appointed
he
called
on
me
as
we
had
arranged
the
night
before
carrying
a
huge
carpet
bag
containing
necessaries
i
took
him
to
modena
in
a
post
chaise
and
there
we
dined
afterward
i
gave
him
a
letter
for
dandolo
promising
to
send
on
his
trunk
the
next
day
he
was
delighted
to
hear
that
venice
was
his
destination
as
he
had
long
wished
to
go
there
and
i
promised
him
that
dandolo
should
see
that
he
lived
as
comfortably
and
cheaply
as
he
had
done
at
bologna
i
saw
him
off
and
returned
to
bologna
the
trunk
i
dispatched
after
him
the
following
day
as
i
had
expected
the
poor
victim
appeared
before
me
all
in
tears
the
next
day
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
pity
her
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
pretend
i
did
not
know
the
reason
for
her
despair
i
gave
her
a
long
but
kindly
sermon
endeavouring
to
persuade
her
that
i
had
acted
for
the
best
in
preventing
the
abbe
marrying
her
as
such
a
step
would
have
plunged
them
both
into
misery
the
poor
woman
threw
herself
weeping
at
my
feet
begging
me
to
bring
her
abbe
back
and
swearing
by
all
the
saints
that
she
would
never
mention
the
word
marriage
again
by
way
of
calming
her
i
said
i
would
do
my
best
to
win
him
over
she
asked
where
he
was
and
i
said
at
venice
but
of
course
she
did
not
believe
me
there
are
circumstances
when
a
clever
man
deceives
by
telling
the
truth
and
such
a
lie
as
this
must
be
approved
by
the
most
rigorous
moralists
months
later
i
met
bolini
at
venice
i
shall
describe
the
meeting
in
its
proper
place
a
few
days
after
he
had
gone
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
fair
viscioletta
and
fell
so
ardently
in
love
with
her
that
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
buy
her
with
hard
cash
the
time
when
i
could
make
women
fall
in
love
with
me
was
no
more
and
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
either
to
do
without
them
or
to
buy
them
i
can
not
help
laughing
when
people
ask
me
for
advice
as
i
feel
so
certain
that
my
advice
will
not
be
taken
man
is
an
animal
that
has
to
learn
his
lesson
by
hard
experience
in
battling
with
the
storms
of
life
thus
the
world
is
always
in
disorder
and
always
ignorant
for
those
who
know
are
always
in
an
infinitesimal
proportion
to
the
whole
madame
viscioletta
whom
i
went
to
see
every
day
treated
me
as
the
florentine
widow
had
done
though
the
widow
required
forms
and
ceremonies
which
i
could
dispense
with
in
the
presence
of
the
fair
viscioletta
who
was
nothing
else
than
a
professional
courtezan
though
she
called
herself
a
virtuosa
i
had
besieged
her
for
three
weeks
without
any
success
and
when
i
made
any
attempts
she
repulsed
me
laughingly
monsignor
buoncompagni
the
was
her
lover
in
secret
though
all
the
town
knew
it
but
this
sort
of
conventional
secrecy
is
common
enough
in
italy
as
as
ecclesiastic
he
could
not
court
her
openly
but
the
hussy
made
no
mystery
whatever
of
his
visits
being
in
need
of
money
and
preferring
to
get
rid
of
my
carriage
than
of
anything
else
i
announced
it
for
sale
at
the
price
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
roman
crowns
it
was
a
comfortable
and
handsome
carriage
and
was
well
worth
the
price
i
was
told
that
the
offered
three
hundred
crowns
and
i
felt
a
real
pleasure
in
contradicting
my
favoured
rival
desires
i
told
the
man
that
i
had
stated
my
price
and
meant
to
adhere
to
it
as
i
was
not
accustomed
to
bargaining
i
went
to
see
my
carriage
at
noon
one
day
to
make
sure
that
it
was
in
good
condition
and
met
the
who
knew
me
from
meeting
me
at
the
legate
and
must
have
been
aware
that
i
was
poaching
on
his
preserves
he
told
me
rudely
that
the
carriage
was
not
worth
more
than
three
hundred
crowns
and
that
i
ought
to
be
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
getting
rid
of
it
as
it
was
much
too
good
for
me
i
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
despise
his
violence
and
telling
him
dryly
that
i
did
not
chaffer
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
went
my
way
next
day
the
fair
viscioletta
wrote
me
a
note
to
the
effect
that
she
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
i
would
let
the
have
the
carriage
at
his
own
price
as
she
felt
sure
he
would
give
it
to
her
i
replied
that
i
would
call
on
her
in
the
afternoon
and
that
my
answer
would
depend
on
my
welcome
i
went
in
due
course
and
after
a
lively
discussion
she
gave
way
and
i
signified
my
willingness
to
sell
the
carriage
for
the
sum
offered
by
the
the
next
day
she
had
her
carriage
and
i
had
my
three
hundred
crowns
and
i
let
the
proud
prelate
understand
that
i
had
avenged
myself
for
his
rudeness
about
this
time
severini
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
position
as
tutor
in
an
illustrious
neapolitan
family
and
as
soon
as
he
received
his
he
left
bologna
i
also
had
thoughts
of
leaving
the
town
i
had
kept
up
an
interesting
correspondence
with
zaguri
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
obtain
my
recall
in
concert
with
dandolo
who
desired
nothing
better
zaguri
told
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
obtain
my
pardon
i
must
come
and
live
as
near
as
possible
to
the
venetian
borders
so
that
the
state
inquisitors
might
satisfy
themselves
of
my
good
conduct
zuliani
brother
to
the
duchess
of
fiano
gave
me
the
same
advice
and
promised
to
use
all
his
interest
in
my
behalf
with
the
idea
of
following
this
counsel
i
decided
to
set
up
my
abode
at
trieste
where
zaguri
told
me
he
had
an
intimate
friend
to
whom
he
would
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
as
i
could
not
go
by
land
without
passing
through
the
states
of
venice
i
resolved
to
go
to
ancona
whence
boats
sail
to
trieste
every
day
as
i
should
pass
through
pesaro
i
asked
my
patron
to
give
me
a
letter
for
the
marquis
mosca
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
whom
i
had
long
wished
to
know
just
then
he
was
a
good
deal
talked
about
on
account
of
a
treatise
on
alms
which
he
had
recently
published
and
which
the
roman
curia
had
placed
on
the
index
the
marquis
was
a
devotee
as
well
as
a
man
of
learning
and
was
imbued
with
the
doctrine
of
augustine
which
becomes
jansenism
if
pushed
to
an
extreme
point
i
was
sorry
to
leave
bologna
for
i
had
spent
eight
pleasant
months
there
in
two
days
i
arrived
at
pesaro
in
perfect
health
and
well
provided
for
in
every
way
i
left
my
letter
with
the
marquis
and
he
came
to
see
me
the
same
day
he
said
his
house
would
always
be
open
to
me
and
that
he
would
leave
me
in
his
wife
hands
to
be
introduced
to
everybody
and
everything
in
the
place
he
ended
by
asking
me
to
dine
with
him
the
following
day
adding
that
if
i
cared
to
examine
his
library
he
could
give
me
an
excellent
cup
of
chocolate
i
went
and
saw
an
enormous
collection
of
comments
on
the
latin
poets
from
ennius
to
the
poets
of
the
twelfth
century
of
our
era
he
had
had
them
all
printed
at
his
own
expense
and
at
his
private
press
in
four
tall
folios
very
accurately
printed
but
without
elegance
i
told
him
my
opinion
and
he
agreed
that
i
was
right
the
want
of
elegance
which
had
spared
him
an
outlay
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
had
deprived
him
of
a
profit
of
three
hundred
thousand
he
presented
me
with
a
copy
which
he
sent
to
my
inn
with
an
immense
folio
volume
entitled
marmora
pisaurentia
which
i
had
no
time
to
examine
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
marchioness
who
had
three
daughters
and
two
sons
all
and
well
bred
the
marchioness
was
a
woman
of
the
world
while
her
husband
interests
were
confined
to
his
books
this
difference
in
disposition
sometimes
gave
rise
to
a
slight
element
of
discord
but
a
stranger
would
never
have
noticed
it
if
he
had
not
been
told
fifty
years
ago
a
wise
man
said
to
me
every
family
is
troubled
by
some
small
tragedy
which
should
be
kept
private
with
the
greatest
care
in
fine
people
should
learn
to
wash
their
dirty
linen
in
private
the
marchioness
paid
me
great
attention
during
the
five
days
i
spent
at
pesaro
in
the
day
she
drove
me
from
one
country
house
to
another
and
at
night
she
introduced
me
to
all
the
nobility
of
the
town
the
marquis
might
have
been
fifty
then
he
was
cold
by
temperament
had
no
other
passion
but
that
of
study
and
his
morals
were
pure
he
had
founded
an
academy
of
which
he
was
the
president
its
design
was
a
fly
in
allusion
to
his
name
mosca
with
the
words
me
ce
that
is
to
say
take
away
from
and
you
have
his
only
failing
was
that
which
the
monks
regard
as
his
finest
quality
he
was
religious
to
excess
and
this
excess
of
religion
went
beyond
the
bounds
where
consistere
rectum
but
which
is
the
better
to
go
beyond
these
bounds
or
not
to
come
up
to
them
i
can
not
venture
to
decide
the
question
horace
says
nulla
est
mihi
religio
and
it
is
the
beginning
of
an
ode
in
which
he
condemns
philosophy
for
estranging
him
from
religion
excess
of
every
kind
is
bad
i
left
pesaro
delighted
with
the
good
company
i
had
met
and
only
sorry
i
had
not
seen
the
marquis
brother
who
was
praised
by
everyone
chapter
xx
a
jew
named
mardocheus
becomes
my
travelling
companion
he
persuades
me
to
lodge
in
his
house
i
fall
in
love
with
his
daughter
leah
after
a
stay
of
six
weeks
i
go
to
trieste
some
time
elapsed
before
i
had
time
to
examine
the
marquis
of
collection
of
latin
poets
amongst
which
the
found
no
place
no
doubt
this
work
bore
witness
to
his
love
for
literature
but
not
to
his
learning
for
there
was
nothing
of
his
own
in
it
all
he
had
done
was
to
classify
each
fragment
in
chronological
order
i
should
have
liked
to
see
notes
comments
explanations
and
such
like
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
besides
the
type
was
not
elegant
the
margins
were
poor
the
paper
common
and
misprints
not
infrequent
all
these
are
bad
faults
especially
in
a
work
which
should
have
become
a
classic
consequently
the
book
was
not
a
profitable
one
and
as
the
marquis
was
not
a
rich
man
he
was
occasionally
reproached
by
his
wife
for
the
money
he
had
expended
i
read
his
treatise
on
almsgiving
and
his
apology
for
it
and
understood
a
good
deal
of
the
marquis
way
of
thinking
i
could
easily
imagine
that
his
writings
must
have
given
great
offence
at
rome
and
that
with
sounder
judgment
he
would
have
avoided
this
danger
of
course
the
marquis
was
really
in
the
right
but
in
theology
one
is
only
in
the
right
when
rome
says
yes
the
marquis
was
a
rigorist
and
though
he
had
a
tincture
of
jansenism
he
often
differed
from
augustine
he
denied
for
instance
that
almsgiving
could
annul
the
penalty
attached
to
sin
and
according
to
him
the
only
sort
of
almsgiving
which
had
any
merit
was
that
prescribed
in
the
gospel
let
not
thy
right
hand
know
what
thy
left
hand
doeth
he
even
maintained
that
he
who
gave
alms
sinned
unless
it
was
done
with
the
greatest
secrecy
for
alms
given
in
public
are
sure
to
be
accompanied
by
vanity
it
might
have
been
objected
that
the
merit
of
alms
lies
in
the
intention
with
which
they
are
given
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
good
man
to
slip
a
piece
of
money
into
the
palm
of
some
miserable
being
standing
in
a
public
place
and
yet
this
may
be
done
solely
with
the
idea
of
relieving
distress
without
a
thought
of
the
onlookers
as
i
wanted
to
go
to
trieste
i
might
have
crossed
the
gulf
by
a
small
boat
from
pesaro
a
good
wind
was
blowing
and
i
should
have
got
to
trieste
in
twelve
hours
this
was
my
proper
way
for
i
had
nothing
to
do
at
ancona
and
it
was
a
hundred
miles
longer
but
i
had
said
i
would
go
by
ancona
and
i
felt
obliged
to
do
so
i
had
always
a
strong
tincture
of
superstition
which
has
exercised
considerable
influence
on
my
strange
career
like
socrates
i
too
had
a
demon
to
whom
i
referred
my
doubtful
counsels
doing
his
will
and
obeying
blindly
when
i
felt
a
voice
within
me
telling
me
to
forbear
a
hundred
times
have
i
thus
followed
my
genius
and
occasionally
i
have
felt
inclined
to
complain
that
it
did
not
impel
me
to
act
against
my
reason
more
frequently
whenever
i
did
so
i
found
that
impulse
was
right
and
reason
wrong
and
for
all
that
i
have
still
continued
reasoning
when
i
arrived
at
senegallia
at
three
stages
from
ancona
my
vetturino
asked
me
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
whether
i
would
allow
him
to
accommodate
a
jew
who
was
going
to
ancona
in
the
chaise
my
first
impulse
made
me
answer
sharply
that
i
wanted
no
one
in
my
chaise
much
less
a
jew
the
vetturino
went
out
but
a
voice
said
within
me
you
must
take
poor
israelite
and
in
spite
of
my
repugnance
i
called
back
the
man
and
signified
my
assent
then
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
start
at
an
earlier
hour
for
it
is
friday
and
you
know
the
jews
are
not
allowed
to
travel
after
sunset
i
shall
not
start
a
moment
earlier
than
i
intended
but
you
can
make
your
horses
travel
as
quickly
as
you
like
he
gave
me
no
answer
and
went
out
the
next
morning
i
found
my
jew
an
fellow
in
the
carriage
the
first
thing
he
asked
me
was
why
i
did
not
like
jews
because
your
religion
teaches
you
to
hate
men
of
all
other
religions
especially
christians
and
you
think
you
have
done
a
meritorious
action
when
you
have
deceived
us
you
do
not
look
upon
us
as
brothers
you
are
usurious
unmerciful
our
enemies
and
so
i
do
not
like
you
you
are
mistaken
sir
come
with
me
to
our
synagogue
this
evening
and
you
will
hear
us
pray
for
all
christians
beginning
with
our
lord
the
pope
i
could
not
help
bursting
into
a
roar
of
laughter
true
i
replied
but
the
prayer
comes
from
the
mouth
only
and
not
from
the
heart
if
you
do
not
immediately
confess
that
the
jews
would
not
pray
for
the
christians
if
they
were
the
masters
i
will
fling
you
out
of
the
chaise
of
course
i
did
not
carry
out
this
threat
but
i
completed
his
confusion
by
quoting
in
hebrew
the
passages
in
the
old
testament
where
the
jews
are
bidden
to
do
all
possible
harm
to
the
gentiles
whom
they
were
to
curse
every
day
after
this
the
poor
man
said
no
more
when
we
were
going
to
take
our
dinner
i
asked
him
to
sit
beside
me
but
he
said
his
religion
would
not
allow
him
to
do
so
and
that
he
would
only
eat
eggs
fruit
and
some
foiegras
sausage
he
had
in
his
pocket
he
only
drank
water
because
he
was
not
sure
that
the
wine
was
unadulterated
you
stupid
fellow
i
exclaimed
how
can
you
ever
be
certain
of
the
purity
of
wine
unless
you
have
made
it
yourself
when
we
were
on
our
way
again
he
said
that
if
i
liked
to
come
and
stay
with
him
and
to
content
myself
with
such
dishes
as
god
had
not
forbidden
he
would
make
me
more
comfortable
than
if
i
went
to
the
inn
and
at
a
cheaper
rate
then
you
let
lodgings
to
christians
i
do
let
lodgings
to
anybody
but
i
will
make
an
exception
in
your
case
to
disabuse
you
of
some
of
your
mistaken
notions
i
will
only
ask
you
six
pauls
a
day
and
give
you
two
good
meals
without
wine
then
you
must
give
me
fish
and
wine
i
paying
for
them
as
extras
certainly
i
have
a
christian
cook
and
my
wife
pays
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
the
cooking
you
can
give
me
the
foie
gras
every
day
if
you
will
eat
it
with
me
i
know
what
you
think
but
you
shall
be
satisfied
i
got
down
at
the
jew
house
wondering
at
myself
as
i
did
so
however
i
knew
that
if
i
did
not
like
my
accommodation
i
could
leave
the
next
day
his
wife
and
children
were
waiting
for
him
and
gave
him
a
joyful
welcome
in
honour
of
the
sabbath
all
servile
work
was
forbidden
on
this
day
holy
to
the
lord
and
all
over
the
house
and
in
the
face
of
all
the
family
i
observed
a
kind
of
festal
air
i
was
welcomed
like
a
brother
and
i
replied
as
best
i
could
but
a
word
from
mardocheus
so
he
was
called
changed
their
politeness
of
feeling
into
a
politeness
of
interest
mardocheus
shewed
me
two
rooms
for
me
to
choose
the
one
which
suited
me
but
liking
them
both
i
said
i
would
take
the
two
for
another
paul
a
day
with
which
arrangement
he
was
well
enough
pleased
mardocheus
told
his
wife
what
we
had
settled
and
she
instructed
the
christian
servant
to
cook
my
supper
for
me
i
had
my
effects
taken
upstairs
and
then
went
with
mardocheus
to
the
synagogue
during
the
short
service
the
jews
paid
no
attention
to
me
or
to
several
other
christians
who
were
present
the
jews
go
to
the
synagogue
to
pray
and
in
this
respect
i
think
their
conduct
worthy
of
imitation
by
the
christians
on
leaving
the
synagogue
i
went
by
myself
to
the
exchange
thinking
over
the
happy
time
which
would
never
return
it
was
in
ancona
that
i
had
begun
to
enjoy
life
and
when
i
thought
it
over
it
was
quite
a
shock
to
find
that
this
was
thirty
years
ago
for
thirty
years
is
a
long
period
in
a
man
life
and
yet
i
felt
quite
happy
in
spite
of
the
tenth
lustrum
so
near
at
hand
for
me
what
a
difference
i
found
between
my
youth
and
my
middle
age
i
could
scarcely
recognize
myself
i
was
then
happy
but
now
unhappy
then
all
the
world
was
before
me
and
the
future
seemed
a
gorgeous
dream
and
now
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
my
life
had
been
all
in
vain
i
might
live
twenty
years
more
but
i
felt
that
the
happy
time
was
passed
away
and
the
future
seemed
all
dreary
i
reckoned
up
my
years
and
saw
fortune
fly
away
this
in
itself
was
enough
to
sadden
me
for
without
the
favours
of
the
fickle
goddess
life
was
not
worth
living
for
me
at
all
events
my
object
then
was
to
return
to
my
country
it
was
as
if
i
struggled
to
undo
all
that
i
had
done
all
i
could
hope
for
was
to
soften
the
hardships
of
the
slow
but
certain
passage
to
the
grave
these
are
the
thoughts
of
declining
years
and
not
of
youth
the
young
man
looks
only
to
the
present
believes
that
the
sky
will
always
smile
upon
him
and
laughs
at
philosophy
as
it
vainly
preaches
of
old
age
misery
repentance
and
worst
of
all
abhorred
death
such
were
my
thoughts
years
ago
what
must
they
be
now
when
i
am
all
alone
poor
despised
and
impotent
they
would
kill
me
if
i
did
not
resolutely
subdue
them
for
whether
for
good
or
ill
my
heart
is
still
young
of
what
use
are
desires
when
one
can
no
longer
satisfy
them
i
write
to
kill
ennui
and
i
take
a
pleasure
in
writing
whether
i
write
sense
or
nonsense
what
matters
i
am
amused
and
that
is
enough
scriptor

when
i
came
back
i
found
mardocheus
at
supper
with
his
numerous
family
composed
of
eleven
or
twelve
individuals
and
including
his
mother
an
old
woman
of
ninety
who
looked
very
well
i
noticed
another
jew
of
middle
age
he
was
the
husband
of
his
eldest
daughter
who
did
not
strike
me
as
pretty
but
the
younger
daughter
who
was
destined
for
a
jew
of
pesaro
whom
she
had
never
seen
engaged
all
my
attention
i
remarked
to
her
that
if
she
had
not
seen
her
future
husband
she
could
not
be
in
love
with
him
whereupon
she
replied
in
a
serious
voice
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
in
love
before
one
married
the
old
woman
praised
the
girl
for
this
sentiment
and
said
she
had
not
been
in
love
with
her
husband
till
the
first
child
was
born
i
shall
call
the
pretty
jewess
leah
as
i
have
good
reasons
for
not
using
her
real
name
while
they
were
enjoying
their
meal
i
sat
down
beside
her
and
tried
to
make
myself
as
agreeable
as
possible
but
she
would
not
even
look
at
me
my
supper
was
excellent
and
my
bed
very
comfortable
the
next
day
my
landlord
told
me
that
i
could
give
my
linen
to
the
maid
and
that
leah
could
get
it
up
for
me
i
told
him
i
had
relished
my
supper
but
that
i
should
like
the
foie
gras
every
day
as
i
had
a
dispensation
you
shall
have
some
but
leah
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
eats
it
then
leah
must
take
it
with
me
and
you
can
tell
her
that
i
shall
give
her
some
cyprus
wine
which
is
perfectly
pure
i
had
no
wine
but
i
went
for
it
the
same
morning
to
the
venetian
consul
giving
him
dandolo
letter
the
consul
was
a
venetian
of
the
old
leaven
he
had
heard
my
name
and
seemed
delighted
to
make
my
acquaintance
he
was
a
kind
of
clown
without
the
paint
fond
of
a
joke
a
regular
gourmand
and
a
man
of
great
experience
he
sold
me
some
scopolo
and
old
cyprus
muscat
but
he
began
to
exclaim
when
he
heard
where
i
was
lodging
and
how
i
had
come
there
he
is
rich
he
said
but
he
is
also
a
great
usurer
and
if
you
borrow
money
of
him
he
will
make
you
repent
it
after
informing
the
consul
that
i
should
not
leave
till
the
end
of
the
month
i
went
home
to
dinner
which
proved
excellent
the
next
day
i
gave
out
my
linen
to
the
maid
and
leah
came
to
ask
me
how
i
liked
my
lace
got
up
if
leah
had
examined
me
more
closely
she
would
have
seen
that
the
sight
of
her
magnificent
breast
unprotected
by
any
kerchief
had
had
a
remarkable
effect
on
me
i
told
her
that
i
left
it
all
to
her
and
that
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
the
linen
then
it
will
all
come
under
my
hands
if
you
are
in
no
hurry
to
go
you
can
make
me
stay
as
long
as
you
like
said
i
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
this
declaration
everything
is
quite
right
i
continued
except
the
chocolate
i
like
it
well
frothed
then
i
will
make
it
for
you
myself
then
i
will
give
out
a
double
quantity
and
we
will
take
it
together
i
do
like
chocolate
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
but
you
like
foie
gras
yes
i
do
and
from
what
father
tells
me
i
am
going
to
take
some
with
you
i
shall
be
delighted
i
suppose
you
are
afraid
of
being
poisoned
not
at
all
i
only
wish
we
could
die
together
she
pretended
not
to
understand
and
left
me
burning
with
desire
i
felt
that
i
must
either
obtain
possession
of
her
or
tell
her
father
not
to
send
her
into
my
room
any
more
the
turin
jewess
had
given
me
some
valuable
hints
as
to
the
conduct
of
amours
with
jewish
girls
my
theory
was
that
leah
would
be
more
easily
won
than
she
for
at
ancona
there
was
much
more
liberty
than
at
turin
this
was
a
rake
reasoning
but
even
rakes
are
mistaken
sometimes
the
dinner
that
was
served
to
me
was
very
good
though
cooked
in
the
jewish
style
and
leah
brought
in
the
foie
gras
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me
with
a
muslin
kerchief
over
her
breast
the
foie
gras
was
excellent
and
we
washed
it
down
with
copious
libations
of
scopolo
which
leah
found
very
much
to
her
taste
when
the
foie
gras
was
finished
she
got
up
but
i
stopped
her
for
the
dinner
was
only
half
over
i
will
stay
then
said
she
but
i
am
afraid
my
father
will
object
very
good
call
your
master
i
said
to
the
maid
who
came
in
at
that
moment
i
have
a
word
to
speak
to
him
my
dear
mardocheus
i
said
when
he
came
your
daughter
appetite
doubles
mine
and
i
shall
be
much
obliged
if
you
will
allow
her
to
keep
me
company
whenever
we
have
foie
gras
it
is
to
my
profit
to
double
your
appetite
but
if
you
like
to
pay
double
i
shall
have
no
objection
very
good
that
arrangement
will
suit
me
in
evidence
of
my
satisfaction
i
gave
him
a
bottle
of
scopolo
which
leah
guaranteed
pure
we
dined
together
and
seeing
that
the
wine
was
making
her
mirthful
i
told
her
that
her
eyes
were
inflaming
me
and
that
she
must
let
me
kiss
them
my
duty
obliges
me
to
say
nay
no
kissing
and
no
touching
we
have
only
got
to
eat
and
drink
together
and
i
shall
like
it
as
much
as
you
you
are
cruel
i
am
wholly
dependent
on
my
father
shall
i
ask
your
father
to
give
you
leave
to
be
kind
i
do
think
that
would
be
proper
and
my
father
might
be
offended
and
not
allow
me
to
see
you
any
more
and
supposing
he
told
you
not
to
be
scrupulous
about
trifles
then
i
should
despise
him
and
continue
to
do
my
duty
so
clear
a
declaration
shewed
me
that
if
i
persevered
in
this
intrigue
i
might
go
on
for
ever
without
success
i
also
bethought
me
that
i
ran
a
risk
of
neglecting
my
chief
business
which
would
not
allow
me
to
stay
long
in
ancona
i
said
nothing
more
to
leah
just
then
and
when
the
dessert
came
in
i
gave
her
some
cyprus
wine
which
she
declared
was
the
most
delicious
nectar
she
had
ever
tasted
i
saw
that
the
wine
was
heating
her
and
it
seemed
incredible
to
me
that
bacchus
should
reign
without
venus
but
she
had
a
hard
head
her
blood
was
hot
and
her
brain
cool
however
i
tried
to
seize
her
hand
and
kiss
it
but
she
drew
it
away
saying
pleasantly
it
too
much
for
honour
and
too
little
for
love
this
witty
remark
amused
me
and
it
also
let
me
know
that
she
was
not
exactly
a
neophyte
i
determined
to
postpone
matters
till
the
next
day
and
told
her
not
to
get
me
any
supper
as
i
was
supping
with
the
venetian
consul
the
consul
had
told
me
that
he
did
not
dine
but
that
he
would
always
be
delighted
to
see
me
at
supper
it
was
midnight
when
i
came
home
and
everyone
was
asleep
except
the
maid
who
let
me
in
i
gave
her
such
a
gratuity
that
she
must
have
wished
me
to
keep
late
hours
for
the
rest
of
my
stay
i
proceeded
to
sound
her
about
leah
but
she
told
me
nothing
but
good
if
she
was
to
be
believed
leah
was
a
good
girl
always
at
work
loved
by
all
and
fancy
free
the
maid
could
not
have
praised
her
better
if
she
had
been
paid
to
do
so
in
the
morning
leah
brought
the
chocolate
and
sat
down
on
my
bed
saying
that
we
should
have
some
fine
foie
gras
and
that
she
should
have
all
the
better
appetite
for
dinner
as
she
had
not
taken
any
supper
why
did
you
take
any
supper
i
suppose
it
was
because
of
your
excellent
cyprus
wine
to
which
my
father
has
taken
a
great
liking
ah
he
like
it
we
will
give
him
some
leah
was
in
a
state
of
undress
as
before
and
the
sight
of
her
spheres
drove
me
to
distraction
are
you
not
aware
that
you
have
a
beautiful
breast
said
i
i
thought
all
young
girls
were
just
the
same
have
you
no
suspicion
that
the
sight
is
a
very
pleasant
one
for
me
if
that
be
so
i
am
very
glad
for
i
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
for
a
girl
has
no
call
to
hide
her
throat
any
more
than
her
face
unless
she
is
in
grand
company
as
she
was
speaking
leah
looked
at
a
golden
heart
transfixed
with
an
arrow
and
set
with
small
diamonds
which
served
me
as
a
shirt
stud
do
you
like
the
little
heart
said
i
very
much
is
it
pure
gold
certainly
and
that
being
so
i
think
i
may
offer
it
to
you
so
saying
i
took
it
off
but
she
thanked
me
politely
and
said
that
a
girl
who
gave
nothing
must
take
nothing
take
it
i
will
never
ask
any
favour
of
you
but
i
should
be
indebted
to
you
and
that
the
reason
why
i
never
take
anything
i
saw
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
or
rather
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
do
too
much
to
do
anything
and
that
in
any
case
the
best
plan
would
be
to
give
her
up
i
put
aside
all
thoughts
of
violence
which
would
only
anger
her
or
make
her
laugh
at
me
i
should
either
have
been
degraded
or
rendered
more
amorous
and
all
for
nothing
if
she
had
taken
offense
she
would
not
have
come
to
see
me
any
more
and
i
should
have
had
nought
to
complain
of
in
fine
i
made
up
my
mind
to
restrain
myself
and
indulge
no
more
in
amorous
talk
we
dined
very
pleasantly
together
the
servant
brought
in
some
which
are
forbidden
by
the
mosaic
law
while
the
maid
was
in
the
room
i
asked
leah
to
take
some
and
she
refused
indignantly
but
directly
the
girl
was
gone
she
took
some
of
her
own
accord
and
ate
them
eagerly
assuring
me
that
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
shellfish
this
girl
i
said
to
myself
who
breaks
the
law
of
her
religion
with
such
levity
who
likes
pleasure
and
does
not
conceal
it
this
is
the
girl
who
wants
to
make
me
believe
that
she
is
insensible
to
the
pleasures
of
love
that
impossible
though
she
may
not
love
me
she
must
have
some
secret
means
of
satisfying
her
passions
which
in
my
opinion
are
very
violent
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
this
evening
with
the
help
of
a
bottle
of
good
muscat
however
when
the
evening
came
she
said
she
could
not
drink
or
eat
anything
as
a
meal
always
prevented
her
sleeping
the
next
day
she
brought
me
my
chocolate
but
her
beautiful
breast
was
covered
with
a
white
kerchief
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
as
usual
and
i
observed
in
a
melancholy
manner
that
she
had
only
covered
her
breast
because
i
had
said
i
took
a
pleasure
in
seeing
it
she
replied
that
she
had
not
thought
of
anything
and
had
only
put
on
her
kerchief
because
she
had
had
no
time
to
fasten
her
stays
you
are
whole
right
i
said
smilingly
for
if
i
were
to
see
the
whole
breast
i
might
not
think
it
beautiful
she
gave
no
answer
and
i
finished
my
chocolate
i
recollected
my
collection
of
obscene
pictures
and
i
begged
leah
to
give
me
the
box
telling
her
that
i
would
shew
her
some
of
the
most
beautiful
breasts
in
the
world
i
sha
care
to
see
them
said
she
but
she
gave
me
the
box
and
sat
down
on
my
bed
as
before
i
took
out
a
picture
of
a
naked
woman
lying
on
her
back
and
abusing
herself
and
covering
up
the
lower
part
of
it
i
shewed
it
to
leah
but
her
breast
is
like
any
other
said
leah
take
away
your
handkerchief
take
it
back
it
disgusting
it
well
enough
done
she
added
with
a
burst
of
laughter
but
it
no
novelty
for
me
no
novelty
for
you
of
course
not
every
girl
does
like
that
before
she
gets
married
then
you
do
it
too
whenever
i
want
to
do
it
now
a
girl
always
does
it
in
private
and
what
do
you
do
after
if
i
am
in
bed
i
go
to
sleep
my
dear
leah
your
sincerity
is
too
much
for
me
either
be
kind
or
visit
me
no
more
you
are
very
weak
i
think
yes
because
i
am
strong
then
henceforth
we
shall
only
meet
at
dinner
but
chew
me
some
more
miniatures
i
have
some
pictures
which
you
will
not
like
let
me
see
them
i
gave
her
arentin
figures
and
was
astonished
to
see
how
coolly
she
examined
them
passing
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
most
commonplace
way
do
you
think
them
interesting
i
said
yes
very
they
are
so
natural
but
a
good
girl
should
not
look
at
such
pictures
anyone
must
be
aware
that
these
voluptuous
attitudes
excite
one
emotions
i
believe
you
leah
and
i
feel
it
as
much
as
you
look
here
she
smiled
and
took
the
book
away
to
the
window
turning
her
back
towards
me
without
taking
any
notice
of
my
appeal
i
had
to
cool
down
and
dress
myself
and
when
the
hairdresser
arrived
leah
went
away
saying
she
would
return
me
my
book
at
dinner
i
was
delighted
thinking
i
was
sure
of
victory
either
that
day
or
the
next
but
i
was
out
of
my
reckoning
we
dined
well
and
drank
better
at
dessert
leah
took
the
book
out
of
her
pocket
and
set
me
all
on
fire
by
asking
me
to
explain
some
of
the
pictures
but
forbidding
all
practical
demonstration
i
went
out
impatiently
determined
to
wait
till
next
morning
when
the
cruel
jewess
came
in
the
morning
she
told
me
that
she
wanted
explanations
but
that
i
must
use
the
pictures
and
nothing
more
as
a
demonstration
of
my
remarks
certainly
i
replied
but
you
must
answer
all
my
questions
as
to
your
sex
i
promise
to
do
so
if
they
arise
naturally
from
the
pictures
the
lesson
lasted
two
hours
and
a
hundred
times
did
i
curse
aretin
and
my
folly
in
shewing
her
his
designs
for
whenever
i
made
the
slightest
attempt
the
pitiless
woman
threatened
to
leave
me
but
the
information
she
gave
me
about
her
own
sex
was
a
perfect
torment
to
me
she
told
me
the
most
lascivious
details
and
explained
with
the
utmost
minuteness
the
different
external
and
internal
movements
which
would
be
developed
in
the
copulations
pictured
by
aretin
i
thought
it
quite
impossible
that
she
could
be
reasoning
from
theory
alone
she
was
not
troubled
by
the
slightest
tincture
of
modesty
but
philosophized
on
coition
as
coolly
and
much
more
learnedly
than
hedvig
i
would
willingly
have
given
her
all
i
possessed
to
crown
her
science
by
the
performance
of
the
great
work
she
swore
it
was
all
pure
theory
with
her
and
i
thought
she
must
be
speaking
the
truth
when
she
said
she
wanted
to
get
married
to
see
if
her
notions
were
right
or
wrong
she
looked
pensive
when
i
told
her
that
the
husband
destined
for
her
might
be
unable
to
discharge
his
connubial
duties
more
than
once
a
week
do
you
mean
to
say
said
she
that
one
man
is
not
as
good
as
another
how
do
you
mean
are
not
all
men
able
to
make
love
every
day
and
every
hour
just
as
they
eat
drink
and
sleep
every
day
no
dear
leah
they
that
can
make
love
every
day
are
very
scarce
in
my
state
of
chronic
irritation
i
felt
much
annoyed
that
there
was
no
decent
place
at
ancona
where
a
man
might
appease
his
passions
for
his
money
i
trembled
to
think
that
i
was
in
danger
of
falling
really
in
love
with
leah
and
i
told
the
consul
every
day
that
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
i
was
as
foolish
as
a
boy
in
his
i
pictured
leah
as
the
purest
of
women
for
with
strong
passions
she
refused
to
gratify
them
i
saw
in
her
a
model
of
virtue
she
was
all
and
purity
resisting
temptation
in
spite
of
the
fire
that
consumed
her
before
long
the
reader
will
discover
how
very
virtuous
leah
was
after
nine
or
ten
days
i
had
recourse
to
violence
not
in
deeds
but
in
words
she
confessed
i
was
in
the
right
and
said
my
best
plan
would
be
to
forbid
her
to
come
and
see
me
in
the
morning
at
dinner
according
to
her
there
would
be
no
risk
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
her
to
continue
her
visits
but
to
cover
her
breast
and
avoid
all
amorous
conversation
with
all
my
heart
she
replied
laughing
but
be
sure
i
shall
not
be
the
first
to
break
the
conditions
i
felt
no
inclination
to
break
them
either
for
three
days
later
i
felt
weary
of
the
situation
and
told
the
consul
i
would
start
on
the
first
opportunity
my
passion
for
leah
was
spoiling
my
appetite
and
i
thus
saw
myself
deprived
of
my
secondary
pleasure
without
any
prospect
of
gaining
my
primary
enjoyment
after
what
i
had
said
to
the
consul
i
felt
i
should
be
bound
to
go
and
i
went
to
bed
calmly
enough
but
about
two
in
the
morning
i
had
contrary
to
my
usual
habit
to
get
up
and
offer
sacrifice
to
cloacina
i
left
my
room
without
any
candle
as
i
knew
my
way
well
enough
about
the
house
the
temple
of
the
goddess
was
on
the
ground
floor
but
as
i
had
put
on
my
soft
slippers
and
walked
very
softly
my
footsteps
did
not
make
the
least
noise
on
my
way
upstairs
i
saw
a
light
shining
through
a
chink
in
the
door
of
a
room
which
i
knew
to
be
unoccupied
i
crept
softly
up
not
dreaming
for
a
moment
that
leah
could
be
there
at
such
an
hour
but
on
putting
my
eye
to
the
chink
i
found
i
could
see
a
bed
and
on
it
were
leah
and
a
young
man
both
stark
naked
and
occupied
in
working
out
aretin
postures
to
the
best
of
their
ability
they
were
whispering
to
one
another
and
every
four
or
five
minutes
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
new
posture
these
changes
of
position
gave
me
a
view
of
all
the
beauties
of
leah
and
this
pleasure
was
something
to
set
against
my
rage
in
having
taken
such
a
profligate
creature
for
a
virtuous
woman
every
time
they
approached
the
completion
of
the
great
work
they
stopped
short
and
completed
what
they
were
doing
with
their
hands
when
they
were
doing
the
straight
tree
to
my
mind
the
most
lascivious
of
them
all
leah
behaved
like
a
true
lesbian
for
while
the
young
man
excited
her
amorous
fury
she
got
hold
of
his
instrument
and
took
it
between
her
lips
till
the
work
was
complete
i
could
not
doubt
that
she
had
swallowed
the
vital
fluid
of
my
fortunate
rival
the
adonis
then
shewed
her
the
feeble
instrument
and
leah
seemed
to
regret
what
she
had
done
before
long
she
began
to
excite
him
again
but
the
fellow
looked
at
his
watch
pushed
her
away
and
began
to
put
on
his
shirt
leah
seemed
angry
and
i
could
see
that
she
reproached
him
for
some
time
before
she
began
to
dress
when
they
were
nearly
clothed
i
softly
returned
to
my
room
and
looked
out
of
a
window
commanding
the
i
had
not
to
wait
long
before
i
saw
the
fortunate
lover
going
out
i
went
to
bed
indignant
with
leah
i
felt
myself
degraded
she
was
no
longer
virtuous
but
a
villainous
prostitute
in
my
eyes
and
i
fell
to
sleep
with
the
firm
resolve
of
driving
her
from
my
room
the
next
morning
after
shaming
her
with
the
story
of
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
but
alas
hasty
and
angry
resolves
can
seldom
withstand
a
few
hours
sleep
as
soon
as
i
saw
leah
coming
in
with
my
chocolate
smiling
and
gay
as
usual
i
told
her
quite
coolly
all
the
exploits
i
had
seen
her
executing
laying
particular
stress
on
the
straight
tree
and
the
curious
liquid
she
had
swallowed
i
ended
by
saying
that
i
hoped
she
would
give
me
the
next
night
both
to
crown
my
love
and
insure
my
secrecy
she
answered
with
perfect
calm
that
i
had
nothing
to
expect
from
her
as
she
did
not
love
me
and
as
for
keeping
the
secret
she
defied
me
to
disclose
it
i
am
sure
you
would
not
be
guilty
of
such
a
disgraceful
action
said
she
with
these
words
she
turned
her
back
on
me
and
went
out
i
could
not
help
confessing
to
myself
that
she
was
in
the
right
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
commit
such
a
baseness
she
had
made
me
reasonable
in
a
few
words
i
do
love
you
there
was
no
reply
to
this
and
i
felt
i
had
no
claim
on
her
rather
it
was
she
who
might
complain
of
me
what
right
had
i
to
spy
over
her
i
could
not
accuse
her
of
deceiving
me
she
was
free
to
do
what
she
liked
with
herself
my
best
course
was
clearly
to
be
silent
i
dressed
myself
hastily
and
went
to
the
exchange
where
i
heard
that
a
vessel
was
sailing
for
fiume
the
same
day
fiume
is
just
opposite
ancona
on
the
other
side
of
the
gulf
from
fiume
to
trieste
the
distance
is
forty
miles
and
i
decided
to
go
by
that
route
i
went
aboard
the
ship
and
took
the
best
place
said
to
the
consul
paid
mardocheus
and
packed
my
trunks
leah
heard
that
i
was
going
the
same
day
and
came
and
told
me
that
she
could
not
give
me
back
my
lace
and
my
silk
stockings
that
day
but
that
i
could
have
them
by
the
next
day
your
father
i
replied
coolly
will
hand
them
all
over
to
the
venetian
consul
who
will
send
them
to
me
at
trieste
just
as
i
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
the
captain
of
the
boat
came
for
my
luggage
with
a
sailor
i
told
him
he
could
have
my
trunk
and
that
i
would
bring
the
rest
aboard
whenever
he
liked
to
go
i
intend
setting
out
an
hour
before
dusk
i
shall
be
ready
when
mardocheus
heard
where
i
was
going
he
begged
me
to
take
charge
of
a
small
box
and
a
letter
he
wanted
to
send
to
a
friend
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
you
this
small
service
at
dinner
leah
sat
down
with
me
and
chattered
as
usual
without
troubling
herself
about
my
monosyllabic
answers
i
supposed
she
wished
me
to
credit
her
with
calm
confidence
and
philosophy
while
i
looked
upon
it
all
as
brazen
impudence
i
hated
and
despised
her
she
had
inflamed
my
passions
told
me
to
my
face
she
did
not
love
me
and
seemed
to
claim
my
respect
through
it
all
possibly
she
expected
me
to
be
grateful
for
her
remark
that
she
believed
me
incapable
of
betraying
her
to
her
father
as
she
drank
my
scopolo
she
said
there
were
several
bottles
left
as
well
as
some
muscat
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
all
i
replied
it
will
prime
you
up
for
your
nocturnal
orgies
she
smiled
and
said
i
had
had
a
gratuitous
sight
of
a
spectacle
which
was
worth
money
and
that
if
i
were
not
going
so
suddenly
she
would
gladly
have
given
me
another
opportunity
this
piece
of
impudence
made
me
want
to
break
the
wine
bottle
on
her
head
she
must
have
known
what
i
was
going
to
do
from
the
way
i
took
it
up
but
she
did
not
waver
for
a
moment
this
coolness
of
hers
prevented
my
committing
a
crime
i
contented
myself
with
saying
that
she
was
the
most
impudent
slut
i
had
ever
met
and
i
poured
the
wine
into
my
glass
with
a
shaking
hand
as
if
that
were
the
purpose
for
which
i
had
taken
up
the
bottle
after
this
scene
i
got
up
and
went
into
the
next
room
nevertheless
in
half
an
hour
she
came
to
take
coffee
with
me
this
persistence
of
hers
disgusted
me
but
i
calmed
myself
by
the
reflection
that
her
conduct
must
be
dictated
by
vengeance
i
should
like
to
help
you
to
pack
said
she
and
i
should
like
to
be
left
alone
i
replied
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
i
led
her
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
after
her
we
were
both
of
us
in
the
right
leah
had
deceived
and
humiliated
me
and
i
had
reason
to
detest
her
while
i
had
discovered
her
for
a
monster
of
hypocrisy
and
immodesty
and
this
was
good
cause
for
her
to
dislike
me
towards
evening
two
sailors
came
after
the
rest
of
the
luggage
and
thanking
my
hostess
i
told
leah
to
put
up
my
linen
and
to
give
it
to
her
father
who
had
taken
the
box
of
which
i
was
to
be
the
bearer
down
to
the
vessel
we
set
sail
with
a
fair
wind
and
i
thought
never
to
set
face
on
leah
again
but
fate
had
ordered
otherwise
we
had
gone
twenty
miles
with
a
good
wind
in
our
quarter
by
which
we
were
borne
gently
from
wave
to
wave
when
all
of
a
sudden
there
fell
a
dead
calm
these
rapid
changes
are
common
enough
in
the
adriatic
especially
in
the
part
we
were
in
the
calm
lasted
but
a
short
time
and
a
stiff
wind
from
the
began
to
blow
with
the
result
that
the
sea
became
very
rough
and
i
was
very
at
midnight
the
storm
had
become
dangerous
the
captain
told
me
that
if
we
persisted
in
going
in
the
wind
eye
we
should
be
wrecked
and
that
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
return
to
ancona
in
less
than
three
hours
we
made
the
harbour
and
the
officer
of
the
guard
having
recognized
me
kindly
allowed
me
to
land
while
i
was
talking
to
the
officer
the
sailors
took
my
trunks
and
carried
them
to
my
old
lodgings
without
waiting
to
ask
my
leave
i
was
vexed
i
wanted
to
avoid
leah
and
i
had
intended
to
sleep
at
the
nearest
inn
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
when
i
arrived
the
jew
got
up
and
said
he
was
delighted
to
see
me
again
it
was
past
three
in
the
morning
and
i
felt
very
ill
so
i
said
i
would
not
get
up
till
late
and
that
i
would
dine
in
my
bed
without
any
foie
gras
i
slept
ten
hours
and
when
i
awoke
i
felt
hungry
and
rang
my
bell
the
maid
answered
and
said
that
she
would
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
me
as
leah
had
a
violent
headache
i
made
no
answer
thanking
providence
for
delivering
me
from
this
impudent
and
dangerous
woman
having
found
my
dinner
rather
spare
i
told
the
cook
to
get
me
a
good
supper
the
weather
was
dreadful
the
venetian
consul
had
heard
of
my
return
and
not
having
seen
me
concluded
i
was
ill
and
paid
me
a
two
hours
visit
he
assured
me
the
storm
would
last
for
a
week
at
least
i
was
very
sorry
to
hear
it
in
the
first
place
because
i
did
not
want
to
see
any
more
of
leah
and
in
the
second
because
i
had
not
got
any
money
luckily
i
had
got
valuable
effects
so
this
second
consideration
did
not
trouble
me
much
as
i
did
not
see
leah
at
i
imagined
that
she
was
feigning
illness
to
avoid
meeting
me
and
i
felt
very
much
obliged
to
her
on
this
account
as
it
appeared
however
i
was
entirely
mistaken
in
my
conjectures
the
next
day
she
came
to
ask
for
chocolate
in
her
usual
way
but
she
no
longer
bore
upon
her
features
her
old
tranquillity
of
expression
i
will
take
coffee
mademoiselle
i
observed
and
as
i
do
not
want
foie
gras
any
longer
i
will
take
dinner
by
myself
consequently
you
may
tell
your
father
that
i
shall
only
pay
seven
pauls
a
day
in
future
i
shall
only
drink
orvieto
wine
you
have
still
four
bottles
of
scopolo
and
cyprus
i
never
take
back
a
present
the
wine
belongs
to
you
i
shall
be
obliged
by
your
leaving
me
alone
as
much
as
possible
as
your
conduct
is
enough
to
irritate
socrates
and
i
am
not
socrates
besides
the
very
sight
of
you
is
disagreeable
to
me
your
body
may
be
beautiful
but
knowing
that
the
soul
within
is
a
monster
it
charms
me
no
longer
you
may
be
very
sure
that
the
sailors
brought
my
luggage
here
without
my
orders
or
else
you
would
never
have
seen
me
here
again
where
i
dread
being
poisoned
every
day
leah
went
out
without
giving
me
any
answer
and
i
felt
certain
that
after
my
discourse
she
would
take
care
not
to
trouble
me
again
experience
had
taught
me
that
girls
like
leah
are
not
uncommon
i
had
known
specimens
at
spa
genoa
london
and
at
venice
but
this
jewess
was
the
worst
i
had
ever
met
it
was
saturday
when
mardocheus
came
back
from
the
synagogue
he
asked
me
gaily
why
i
had
mortified
his
daughter
as
she
had
declared
she
had
done
nothing
to
offend
me
i
have
not
mortified
her
my
dear
mardocheus
or
at
all
events
such
was
not
my
intention
but
as
i
have
put
myself
on
diet
i
shall
be
eating
no
more
foie
gras
and
consequently
i
shall
dine
by
myself
and
save
three
pauls
a
day
leah
is
quite
ready
to
pay
me
out
of
her
private
purse
and
she
wants
to
dine
with
you
to
assure
you
against
being
poisoned
as
she
informs
me
that
you
have
expressed
that
fear
that
was
only
a
jest
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
i
am
in
the
house
of
an
honest
man
i
do
want
your
daughter
to
pay
for
herself
and
to
prove
that
i
am
not
actuated
by
feelings
of
economy
you
shall
dine
with
me
too
to
offer
to
pay
for
me
is
an
impertinence
on
her
part
in
fine
i
will
either
dine
by
myself
and
pay
you
seven
pawls
a
day
or
i
will
pay
you
thirteen
and
have
both
father
and
daughter
to
dine
with
me
the
worthy
mardocheus
went
away
saying
that
he
really
could
not
allow
me
to
dine
by
myself
at
i
talked
only
to
mardocheus
without
glancing
at
leah
or
paying
any
attention
to
the
witty
sallies
she
uttered
to
attract
me
i
only
drank
orvieto
at
dessert
leah
filled
my
glass
with
scopolo
saying
that
if
i
did
not
drink
it
neither
would
she
i
replied
without
looking
at
her
that
i
advised
her
only
to
drink
water
for
the
future
and
that
i
wanted
nothing
at
her
hands
mardocheus
who
liked
wine
laughed
and
said
i
was
right
and
drank
for
three
the
weather
continued
bad
and
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
writing
and
after
supper
i
retired
and
went
to
sleep
suddenly
i
was
aroused
by
a
slight
noise
who
is
there
said
i
heard
leah
voice
whispering
in
reply
is
i
i
have
not
come
to
disturb
you
but
to
justify
myself
so
saying
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
but
on
the
outside
of
the
coverlet
i
was
pleased
with
this
extraordinary
visit
for
my
sole
desire
was
for
vengeance
and
i
felt
certain
of
being
able
to
resist
all
her
arts
i
therefore
told
her
politely
enough
that
i
considered
her
as
already
justified
and
that
i
should
be
obliged
by
her
leaving
me
as
i
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
not
before
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
say
go
on
i
am
listening
to
you
thereupon
she
began
a
discourse
which
i
did
not
interrupt
and
which
lasted
for
a
good
hour
she
spoke
very
artfully
and
after
confessing
she
had
done
wrong
she
said
that
at
my
age
i
should
have
been
ready
to
overlook
the
follies
of
a
young
and
passionate
girl
according
to
her
it
was
all
weakness
and
pardonable
at
such
an
age
i
swear
i
love
you
said
she
and
i
would
have
given
you
good
proof
before
now
if
i
had
not
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
love
the
young
christian
you
saw
with
me
while
he
does
not
care
for
me
in
the
least
indeed
i
have
to
pay
him
in
spite
of
my
passion
she
continued
i
have
never
given
him
what
a
girl
can
give
but
once
i
had
not
seen
him
for
six
months
and
it
was
your
fault
that
i
sent
for
him
for
you
inflamed
me
with
your
pictures
and
strong
wines
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
i
ought
to
forget
everything
and
treat
her
kindly
during
the
few
days
i
was
to
remain
there
when
she
finished
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
make
any
objection
i
pretended
to
be
convinced
assuring
her
that
i
felt
i
had
been
in
the
wrong
in
letting
her
see
aretin
figures
and
that
i
would
no
longer
evince
any
resentment
towards
her
as
her
explanation
did
not
seem
likely
to
end
in
the
way
she
wished
she
went
on
talking
about
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
the
strength
of
which
often
hushes
the
voice
of
passion
etc
her
aim
being
to
persuade
me
that
she
loved
me
and
that
her
refusals
had
all
been
given
with
the
idea
of
making
my
love
the
stronger
no
doubt
i
might
have
given
her
a
great
many
answers
but
i
said
nothing
i
made
up
my
mind
to
await
the
assault
that
i
saw
was
impending
and
then
by
refusing
all
her
advances
i
reckoned
on
abasing
her
to
the
uttermost
nevertheless
she
made
no
motion
her
hands
were
at
rest
and
she
kept
her
face
at
a
due
distance
from
mine
at
last
tired
out
with
the
struggle
she
left
me
pretending
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
what
she
had
done
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
fact
that
she
had
confined
herself
to
verbal
persuasion
for
if
she
had
gone
further
she
would
probably
have
achieved
a
complete
victory
though
we
were
in
the
dark
i
must
mention
that
before
she
left
me
i
had
to
promise
to
allow
her
to
make
my
chocolate
as
usual
early
the
next
morning
she
came
for
the
stick
of
chocolate
she
was
in
a
complete
state
of
negligee
and
came
in
on
tiptoe
though
if
she
chose
to
look
towards
the
bed
she
might
have
seen
that
i
was
wide
awake
i
marked
her
artifices
and
her
cunning
and
resolved
to
be
equal
to
all
her
wiles
when
she
brought
the
chocolate
i
noticed
that
there
were
two
cups
on
the
tray
and
i
said
then
it
is
not
true
that
you
do
like
chocolate
i
feel
obliged
to
relieve
you
of
all
fear
of
being
poisoned
i
noticed
that
she
was
now
dressed
with
the
utmost
decency
while
half
an
hour
before
she
had
only
her
chemise
and
petticoat
her
neck
being
perfectly
bare
the
more
resolved
she
seemed
to
gain
the
victory
the
more
firmly
i
was
determined
to
humiliate
her
as
it
appeared
to
me
the
only
other
alternative
would
have
been
my
shame
and
dishonour
and
this
turned
me
to
stone
in
spite
of
my
resolves
leah
renewed
the
attack
at
dinner
for
contrary
to
my
orders
she
served
a
magnificent
foie
gras
telling
me
that
it
was
for
herself
and
that
if
she
were
poisoned
she
would
die
of
pleasure
mardocheus
said
he
should
like
to
die
too
and
began
regaling
himself
on
it
with
evident
relish
i
could
not
help
laughing
and
announced
my
wish
to
taste
the
deadly
food
and
so
we
all
of
us
were
eating
it
your
resolves
are
not
strong
enough
to
withstand
seduction
said
leah
this
remark
piqued
me
and
i
answered
that
she
was
imprudent
to
disclose
her
designs
in
such
a
manner
and
that
she
would
find
my
resolves
strong
enough
when
the
time
came
a
faint
smile
played
about
her
lips
try
if
you
like
i
said
to
persuade
me
to
drink
some
scopolo
or
muscat
i
meant
to
have
taken
some
but
your
taunt
has
turned
me
to
steel
i
mean
to
prove
that
when
i
make
up
my
mind
i
never
alter
it
the
man
never
gives
way
said
leah
but
the
man
often
lets
himself
be
overpersuaded
quite
so
and
the
girl
refrains
from
taunting
a
man
for
his
weakness
for
her
i
called
the
maid
and
told
her
to
go
to
the
venetian
consul
and
get
me
some
more
scopolo
and
muscat
leah
piqued
me
once
more
by
saying
enthusiastically
i
am
sure
you
are
the
most
of
men
as
well
as
the
firmest
mardocheus
who
could
not
make
out
what
we
meant
ate
drank
and
laughed
and
seemed
pleased
with
everything
in
the
afternoon
i
went
out
to
a
cafe
in
spite
of
the
dreadful
weather
i
thought
over
leah
and
her
designs
feeling
certain
that
she
would
pay
me
another
nocturnal
visit
and
renew
the
assault
in
force
i
resolved
to
weaken
myself
with
some
common
woman
if
i
could
find
one
at
all
supportable
a
greek
who
had
taken
me
to
a
disgusting
place
a
few
days
before
conducted
me
to
another
where
he
introduced
me
to
a
painted
horror
of
a
woman
from
whose
very
sight
i
fled
in
terror
i
felt
angry
that
in
a
town
like
ancona
a
man
of
some
delicacy
could
not
get
his
money
worth
for
his
money
and
went
home
supped
by
myself
and
locked
the
door
after
me
the
precaution
however
was
useless
a
few
minutes
after
i
had
shut
the
door
leah
knocked
on
the
pretext
that
i
had
forgotten
to
give
her
the
chocolate
i
opened
the
door
and
gave
it
her
and
she
begged
me
not
to
lock
myself
in
as
she
wanted
to
have
an
important
and
final
interview
you
can
tell
me
now
what
you
want
to
say
no
it
will
take
some
time
and
i
should
not
like
to
come
till
everyone
is
asleep
you
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
you
are
lord
of
yourself
you
can
go
to
bed
in
peace
i
have
certainly
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
to
prove
it
to
you
i
will
leave
the
door
open
i
felt
more
than
ever
certain
of
victory
and
resolved
not
to
blow
out
the
candles
as
my
doing
so
might
be
interpreted
into
a
confession
of
fear
besides
the
light
would
render
my
triumph
and
her
humiliation
more
complete
with
these
thoughts
i
went
to
bed
at
eleven
a
slight
noise
told
me
that
my
hour
had
come
i
saw
leah
enter
my
room
in
her
chemise
and
a
light
petticoat
she
locked
my
door
softly
and
when
i
cried
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
she
let
her
chemise
and
petticoat
drop
and
lay
down
beside
me
in
a
state
of
nature
i
was
too
much
astonished
to
repulse
her
leah
was
sure
of
victory
and
without
a
word
she
threw
herself
upon
me
pressing
her
lips
to
mine
and
depriving
me
of
all
my
faculties
except
one
i
utilised
a
short
moment
of
reflection
by
concluding
that
i
was
a
presumptuous
fool
and
that
leah
was
a
woman
with
a
most
extensive
knowledge
of
human
nature
in
a
second
my
caress
became
as
ardent
as
hers
and
after
kissing
her
spheres
of
rose
and
alabaster
i
penetrated
to
the
sanctuary
of
love
which
much
to
my
astonishment
i
found
to
be
a
virgin
citadel
there
was
a
short
silence
and
then
i
said
dearest
leah
you
oblige
me
to
adore
you
why
did
you
first
inspire
me
with
hate
are
you
not
come
here
merely
to
humiliate
me
to
obtain
an
empty
victory
if
so
i
forgive
you
but
you
are
in
the
wrong
for
believe
me
enjoyment
is
sweeter
far
than
vengeance
nay
i
have
not
come
to
achieve
a
shameful
victory
but
to
give
myself
to
you
without
reserve
to
render
you
my
conqueror
and
my
king
prove
your
love
by
making
me
happy
break
down
the
barrier
which
i
kept
intact
despite
its
fragility
and
my
ardour
and
if
this
sacrifice
does
not
convince
you
of
my
affection
you
must
be
the
worst
of
men
i
had
never
heard
more
energetic
opinions
and
i
had
never
seen
a
more
voluptuous
sight
i
began
the
work
and
while
leah
aided
me
to
the
best
of
her
ability
i
forced
the
gate
and
on
leah
face
i
read
the
most
acute
pain
and
pleasure
mingled
in
the
first
ecstasy
of
delight
i
felt
her
tremble
in
every
limb
as
for
me
my
enjoyment
was
quite
new
i
was
twenty
again
but
i
had
the
of
my
age
and
treated
leah
with
delicacy
holding
her
in
my
arms
till
three
in
the
morning
when
i
left
her
she
was
inundated
and
exhausted
with
pleasure
while
i
could
do
no
more
she
left
me
full
of
gratitude
carrying
the
soaking
linen
away
with
her
i
slept
on
till
twelve
when
i
awoke
and
saw
her
standing
by
my
bedside
with
the
gentle
love
of
the
day
after
the
wedding
the
idea
of
my
approaching
departure
saddened
me
i
told
her
so
and
she
begged
me
to
stay
on
as
long
as
i
could
i
repeated
that
we
would
arrange
everything
when
we
met
again
at
night
we
had
a
delicious
dinner
for
mardocheus
was
bent
on
convincing
me
that
he
was
no
miser
i
spent
the
afternoon
with
the
consul
and
arranged
that
i
should
go
on
a
neapolitan
which
was
in
quarantine
at
the
time
and
was
to
sail
for
trieste
as
i
should
be
obliged
to
pass
another
month
at
ancona
i
blessed
the
storm
that
had
driven
me
back
i
gave
the
consul
the
gold
with
which
the
elector
of
cologne
had
presented
me
keeping
the
portrait
as
a
memento
three
days
later
he
handed
me
forty
gold
sequins
which
was
ample
for
my
needs
my
stay
in
ancona
was
costing
me
dear
but
when
i
told
mardocheus
that
i
should
not
be
going
for
another
month
he
declared
he
would
no
longer
feed
at
my
expense
of
course
i
did
not
insist
leah
still
dined
with
me
it
has
always
been
my
opinion
though
perhaps
i
may
be
mistaken
that
the
jew
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
my
relations
with
his
daughter
jews
are
usually
very
liberal
on
this
article
possibly
because
they
count
on
the
child
being
an
israelite
i
took
care
that
my
dear
leah
should
have
no
reason
to
repent
of
our
connection
how
grateful
and
affectionate
she
was
when
i
told
her
that
i
meant
to
stay
another
month
how
she
blessed
the
bad
weather
which
had
driven
me
back
we
slept
together
every
night
not
excepting
those
nights
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
moses
i
gave
her
the
little
gold
heart
which
might
be
worth
ten
sequins
but
that
would
be
no
reward
for
the
care
she
had
taken
of
my
linen
she
also
made
me
accept
some
splendid
indian
handkerchiefs
six
years
later
i
met
her
again
at
pesaro
i
left
ancona
on
november
and
on
the
i
was
at
trieste
chapter
xxi
pittoni
zaguri
the
procurator
morosini
the
venetian
consul
gorice
the
french
consul
madame
leo
my
devotion
to
the
state
inquisitors
strasoldo
madame
cragnoline
general
burghausen
the
landlord
asked
me
my
name
we
made
our
agreement
and
i
found
myself
very
comfortably
lodged
next
day
i
went
to
the
and
found
several
letters
which
had
been
awaiting
me
for
the
last
month
i
opened
one
from
dandolo
and
found
an
open
enclosure
from
the
patrician
marco
dona
addressed
to
baron
pittoni
chief
of
police
on
reading
it
i
found
i
was
very
warmly
commended
to
the
baron
i
hastened
to
call
on
him
and
gave
him
the
letter
which
he
took
but
did
not
read
he
told
me
that
donna
had
written
to
him
about
me
and
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
do
anything
in
his
power
for
me
i
then
took
mardocheus
letter
to
his
friend
moses
levi
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
the
letter
had
any
reference
to
myself
so
i
gave
it
to
the
first
clerk
that
i
saw
in
the
office
levi
was
an
honest
and
an
agreeable
man
and
the
next
day
he
called
on
me
and
offered
me
his
services
in
the
most
cordial
manner
he
shewed
me
the
letter
i
had
delivered
and
i
was
delighted
to
find
that
it
referred
to
myself
the
worthy
mardocheus
begged
him
to
give
me
a
hundred
sequins
in
case
i
needed
any
money
adding
that
any
politeness
shewn
to
me
would
be
as
if
shewn
to
himself
this
behaviour
on
the
part
of
mardocheus
filled
me
with
gratitude
and
reconciled
me
so
to
speak
with
the
whole
jewish
nation
i
wrote
him
a
letter
of
thanks
offering
to
serve
him
at
venice
in
any
way
i
could
i
could
not
help
comparing
the
cordiality
of
levi
welcome
with
the
formal
and
ceremonious
reception
of
baron
pittoni
the
baron
was
ten
or
twelve
years
younger
than
i
he
was
a
man
of
parts
and
quite
devoid
of
prejudice
a
sworn
foe
of
and
tuum
and
wholly
incapable
of
economy
he
left
the
whole
care
of
his
house
to
his
valet
who
robbed
him
but
the
baron
knew
it
and
made
no
objection
he
was
a
determined
bachelor
a
gallant
and
the
friend
and
patron
of
libertines
his
chief
defect
was
his
forgetfulness
and
absence
of
mind
which
made
him
mismanage
important
business
he
was
reputed
though
wrongly
to
be
a
liar
a
liar
is
a
person
who
tells
falsehoods
intentionally
while
if
pittoni
told
lies
it
was
because
he
had
forgotten
the
truth
we
became
good
friends
in
the
course
of
a
month
and
we
have
remained
friends
to
this
day
i
wrote
to
my
friends
at
venice
announcing
my
arrival
at
trieste
and
for
the
next
ten
days
i
kept
my
room
busied
in
putting
together
the
notes
i
had
made
on
polish
events
since
the
death
of
elizabeth
petrovna
i
meant
to
write
a
history
of
the
troubles
of
unhappy
poland
up
to
its
dismemberment
which
was
taking
place
at
the
epoch
in
which
i
was
writing
i
had
foreseen
all
this
when
the
polish
diet
recognized
the
dying
czarina
as
empress
of
all
the
russians
and
the
elector
of
brandenburg
as
king
of
prussia
and
i
proceeded
with
my
history
but
only
the
first
three
volumes
were
published
owing
to
the
printers
breaking
the
agreement
the
four
last
volumes
will
be
found
in
manuscript
after
my
death
and
anyone
who
likes
may
publish
them
but
i
have
become
indifferent
to
all
this
as
to
many
other
matters
since
i
have
seen
folly
crowned
king
of
the
earth
there
is
no
such
country
as
poland
but
it
might
still
be
in
existence
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
ambition
of
the
czartoryski
family
whose
pride
had
been
humiliated
by
count
bruhl
the
prime
minister
to
gain
vengeance
prince
augustus
czartoryski
ruined
his
country
he
was
so
blinded
by
passion
that
he
forgot
that
all
actions
have
their
inevitable
results
czartoryski
had
determined
not
only
to
exclude
the
house
of
saxony
from
the
succession
but
to
dethrone
the
member
of
that
family
who
was
reigning
to
do
this
the
help
of
the
czarina
and
of
the
elector
of
brandenburg
was
necessary
so
he
made
the
polish
diet
acknowledge
the
one
as
empress
of
all
the
russians
and
the
other
as
king
of
prussia
the
two
sovereigns
would
not
treat
with
the
polish
commonwealth
till
this
claim
had
been
satisfied
but
the
commonwealth
should
never
have
granted
these
titles
for
poland
itself
possessed
most
of
the
russias
and
was
the
true
sovereign
of
prussia
the
elector
of
brandenburg
being
only
duke
of
prussia
in
reality
prince
czartoryski
blinded
by
the
desire
of
vengeance
persuaded
the
diet
that
to
give
the
two
sovereigns
these
titles
would
be
merely
a
form
and
that
they
would
never
become
anything
more
than
honorary
this
might
be
so
but
if
poland
had
possessed
statesmen
they
would
have
guessed
that
an
honorary
title
would
end
in
the
usurpation
of
the
whole
country
the
russian
palatin
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
nephew
stanislas
poniatowski
on
the
throne
i
myself
told
him
that
these
titles
gave
a
right
and
that
the
promise
not
to
make
any
use
of
them
was
a
mere
delusion
i
added
jokingly
for
i
was
obliged
to
adopt
a
humorous
tone
that
before
long
europe
would
take
pity
on
poland
which
had
to
bear
the
heavy
weight
of
all
the
russias
and
the
kingdom
of
prussia
as
well
and
the
commonwealth
would
find
itself
relieved
of
all
these
charges
my
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
the
two
princes
whose
titles
were
allowed
have
torn
poland
limb
from
limb
it
is
now
absorbed
in
russia
and
prussia
the
second
great
mistake
made
by
poland
was
in
not
remembering
the
apologue
of
the
man
and
the
horse
when
the
question
of
protection
presented
itself
the
republic
of
rome
became
mistress
of
the
world
by
protecting
other
nations
thus
poland
came
to
ruin
through
ambition
vengeance
and
folly
but
folly
most
of
all
the
same
reason
lay
at
the
root
of
the
french
revolution
louis
xvi
paid
the
penalty
of
his
folly
with
his
life
if
he
had
been
a
wise
ruler
he
would
still
be
on
the
throne
and
france
would
have
escaped
the
fury
of
the
revolutionists
france
is
sick
in
any
other
country
this
sickness
might
be
remedied
but
i
would
not
wonder
if
it
proved
incurable
in
france
certain
emotional
persons
are
moved
to
pity
by
the
emigrant
french
nobles
but
for
my
part
i
think
them
only
worthy
of
contempt
instead
of
parading
their
pride
and
their
disgrace
before
the
eyes
of
foreign
nations
they
should
have
rallied
round
their
king
and
either
have
saved
the
throne
or
died
under
its
ruins
what
will
become
of
france
it
was
hard
to
say
but
it
is
certain
that
a
body
without
a
head
can
not
live
very
long
for
reason
is
situate
in
the
head
on
december
baron
pittoni
begged
me
to
call
on
him
as
some
one
had
come
from
venice
on
purpose
to
see
me
i
dressed
myself
hastily
and
went
to
the
baron
where
i
saw
a
man
of
or
forty
elegantly
dressed
he
looked
at
me
with
the
liveliest
interest
my
heart
tells
me
i
began
that
your
excellence
name
is
zaguri
exactly
so
my
dear
casanova
as
soon
as
my
friend
dandolo
told
me
of
your
arrival
here
i
determined
to
come
and
congratulate
you
on
your
approaching
recall
which
will
take
place
either
this
year
or
the
next
as
i
hope
to
see
two
friends
of
mine
made
inquisitors
you
may
judge
of
my
friendship
for
you
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
an
and
that
there
is
a
law
forbidding
such
to
leave
venice
we
will
spend
and
together
i
replied
in
a
manner
to
convince
him
that
i
was
sensible
of
the
honour
he
had
done
me
and
i
heard
baron
pittoni
begging
me
to
excuse
him
for
not
having
come
to
see
me
he
said
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
a
handsome
old
man
begged
his
excellence
to
ask
me
to
dine
with
him
though
he
had
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
me
what
said
zaguri
casanova
has
been
here
for
the
last
ten
days
and
does
not
know
the
venetian
consul
i
hastened
to
speak
it
my
own
fault
i
observed
i
did
not
like
calling
on
this
gentleman
for
fear
he
might
think
me
contraband
the
consul
answered
wittily
that
i
was
not
contraband
but
in
quarantine
pending
my
return
to
my
native
land
and
that
in
the
meanwhile
his
house
would
always
be
open
to
me
as
had
been
the
house
of
the
venetian
consul
at
ancona
in
this
manner
he
let
me
know
that
he
knew
something
about
me
and
i
was
not
at
all
sorry
for
it
marco
monti
such
was
the
consul
name
was
a
man
of
parts
and
much
experience
a
pleasant
companion
and
a
great
conversationalist
fond
of
telling
amusing
stories
with
a
grave
face
in
fact
most
excellent
company
i
was
something
of
a
myself
and
we
soon
became
friendly
rivals
in
telling
anecdotes
in
spite
of
his
thirty
additional
years
i
was
a
tolerable
match
for
him
and
when
we
were
in
a
room
there
was
no
question
of
gaining
to
kill
the
time
we
became
fast
friends
and
i
benefited
a
good
deal
by
his
offices
during
the
two
years
i
spent
in
trieste
and
i
have
always
thought
that
he
had
a
considerable
share
in
obtaining
my
recall
that
was
my
great
object
in
those
days
i
was
a
victim
to
nostalgia
or
home
sickness
with
the
swiss
and
the
sclavs
it
is
really
a
fatal
disease
which
carries
them
off
if
they
are
not
sent
home
immediately
germans
are
subject
to
this
weakness
also
whilst
the
french
suffer
very
little
and
italians
not
much
more
from
the
complaint
no
rule
however
lacks
its
exception
and
i
was
one
i
daresay
i
should
have
got
over
my
nostalgia
if
i
had
treated
it
with
contempt
and
then
i
should
not
have
wasted
ten
years
of
my
life
in
the
bosom
of
my
cruel
stepmother
venice
i
dined
with
zaguri
at
the
consul
and
i
was
invited
to
dine
with
the
governor
count
auersperg
the
next
day
the
visit
from
a
venetian
made
me
a
person
of
great
consideration
i
was
no
longer
looked
upon
as
an
exile
but
as
one
who
had
successfully
escaped
from
illegal
confinement
the
day
after
i
accompanied
zaguri
to
gorice
where
he
stayed
three
days
to
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
the
nobility
i
was
included
in
all
their
invitations
and
i
saw
that
a
stranger
could
live
very
pleasantly
at
gorice
i
met
there
a
certain
count
cobenzl
who
may
be
alive
now
a
man
of
wisdom
generosity
and
the
vastest
learning
and
yet
without
any
kind
of
pretention
he
gave
a
state
dinner
to
zaguri
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
there
three
or
four
most
charming
ladies
i
also
met
count
tomes
a
spaniard
whose
father
was
in
in
the
austrian
service
he
had
married
at
sixty
and
had
five
children
all
as
ugly
as
himself
his
daughter
was
a
charming
girl
in
spite
of
her
plainness
she
evidently
got
her
character
from
the
mother
side
the
eldest
son
who
was
ugly
and
squinted
was
a
kind
of
pleasant
madman
but
he
was
also
a
liar
a
profligate
a
boaster
and
totally
devoid
of
discretion
in
spite
of
these
defects
he
was
much
sought
after
in
society
as
he
told
a
good
tale
and
made
people
laugh
if
he
had
been
a
student
he
would
have
been
a
distinguished
scholar
as
his
memory
was
prodigious
he
it
was
who
vainly
guaranteed
the
agreement
i
made
with
valerio
valeri
for
printing
my
history
of
poland
i
also
met
at
gorice
a
count
coronini
who
was
known
in
learned
circles
as
the
author
of
some
latin
treatises
on
diplomacy
nobody
read
his
books
but
everybody
agreed
that
he
was
a
very
learned
man
i
also
met
a
young
man
named
morelli
who
had
written
a
history
of
the
place
and
was
on
the
point
of
publishing
the
first
volume
he
gave
me
his
begging
me
to
make
any
corrections
that
struck
me
as
desirable
i
succeeded
in
pleasing
him
as
i
gave
him
back
his
work
without
a
single
note
or
alteration
of
any
kind
and
thus
he
became
my
friend
i
became
a
great
friend
of
count
francis
charles
coronini
who
was
a
man
of
talents
he
had
married
a
belgian
lady
but
not
being
able
to
agree
they
had
separated
and
he
passed
his
time
in
trifling
intrigues
hunting
and
reading
the
papers
literary
and
political
he
laughed
at
those
sages
who
declared
that
there
was
not
one
really
happy
person
in
the
world
and
he
supported
his
denial
by
the
unanswerable
dictum
i
myself
am
perfectly
happy
however
as
he
died
of
a
tumor
in
the
head
at
the
age
of
he
probably
acknowledged
his
mistake
in
the
agonies
of
death
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
perfectly
happy
or
perfectly
unhappy
man
in
the
world
one
has
more
happiness
in
his
life
and
another
more
unhappiness
and
the
same
circumstance
may
produce
widely
different
effects
on
individuals
of
different
temperaments
it
is
not
a
fact
that
virtue
ensures
happiness
for
the
exercise
of
some
virtues
implies
suffering
and
suffering
is
incompatible
with
happiness
my
readers
may
be
aware
that
i
am
not
inclined
to
make
mental
pleasure
and
all
sufficing
it
may
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
clear
conscience
but
i
can
not
see
that
it
would
at
all
relieve
the
pangs
of
hunger
baron
pittoni
and
myself
escorted
zaguri
to
the
venetian
border
and
we
then
returned
to
trieste
together
in
three
or
four
days
pittoni
took
me
everywhere
including
the
club
where
none
but
persons
of
distinction
were
admitted
this
club
was
held
at
the
inn
where
i
was
staying
amongst
the
ladies
the
most
noteworthy
was
the
wife
of
the
merchant
david
riguelin
who
was
a
swabian
by
birth
pittoni
was
in
love
with
her
and
continued
so
till
her
death
his
suit
lasted
for
twelve
years
and
like
petrarch
he
still
sighed
still
hoped
but
never
succeeded
her
name
was
zanetta
and
besides
her
beauty
she
had
the
charm
of
being
an
exquisite
singer
and
a
polished
hostess
still
more
noteworthy
however
was
the
unvarying
sweetness
and
equability
of
her
disposition
i
did
not
want
to
know
her
long
before
recognizing
that
she
was
absolutely
impregnable
i
told
pittoni
so
but
all
in
vain
he
still
fed
on
empty
hope
zanetta
had
very
poor
health
though
no
one
would
have
judged
so
from
her
appearance
but
it
was
well
known
to
be
the
case
she
died
at
an
early
age
a
few
days
after
zaguri
departure
i
had
a
note
from
the
consul
informing
me
that
the
procurator
morosini
was
stopping
in
my
inn
and
advising
me
to
call
on
him
if
i
knew
him
i
was
infinitely
obliged
for
this
advice
for
morosini
was
a
personage
of
the
greatest
importance
he
had
known
me
from
childhood
and
the
reader
may
remember
that
he
had
presented
me
to
marshal
richelieu
at
fontainebleau
in
i
dressed
myself
as
if
i
had
been
about
to
speak
to
a
monarch
and
sent
in
a
note
to
his
room
i
had
not
long
to
wait
he
came
out
and
welcomed
me
most
graciously
telling
me
how
delighted
he
was
to
see
me
again
when
he
heard
the
reason
of
my
being
at
trieste
and
how
i
desired
to
return
to
my
country
he
assured
me
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
obtain
me
my
wish
he
thanked
me
for
the
care
i
had
taken
of
his
nephew
at
florence
and
kept
me
all
the
day
while
i
told
him
my
principal
adventures
he
was
glad
to
hear
that
zaguri
was
working
for
me
and
said
that
they
must
concert
the
mater
together
he
commended
me
warmly
to
the
consul
who
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
inform
the
tribunal
of
the
consideration
with
which
morosini
treated
me
after
the
procurator
had
gone
i
began
to
enjoy
life
at
trieste
but
in
strict
moderation
and
with
due
regard
for
economy
for
i
had
only
fifteen
sequins
a
month
i
abjured
play
altogether
every
day
i
dined
with
one
of
the
circle
of
my
friends
who
were
the
venetian
consul
the
french
consul
an
eccentric
but
worthy
man
who
kept
a
good
cook
pittoni
who
kept
an
excellent
table
thanks
to
his
man
who
knew
what
was
to
his
own
interests
and
several
others
as
for
the
pleasures
of
love
i
enjoyed
them
in
moderation
taking
care
of
my
purse
and
of
my
health
towards
the
end
of
the
carnival
i
went
to
a
masked
ball
at
the
theatre
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
a
harlequin
came
up
and
presented
his
columbine
to
me
they
both
began
to
play
tricks
on
me
i
was
pleased
with
the
columbine
and
felt
a
strong
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
her
after
some
vain
researches
the
french
consul
de
sauveur
told
me
that
the
harlequin
was
a
young
lady
of
rank
and
that
the
columbine
was
a
handsome
young
man
if
you
like
he
added
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
harlequin
family
and
i
am
sure
you
will
appreciate
her
charms
when
you
see
her
as
a
girl
as
they
persisted
in
their
jokes
i
was
able
without
wounding
decency
overmuch
to
convince
myself
that
the
consul
was
right
on
the
question
of
sex
and
when
the
ball
was
over
i
said
i
should
be
obliged
by
his
introducing
me
as
he
had
promised
he
promised
to
do
so
the
day
after
ash
wednesday
thus
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
madame
leo
who
was
still
pretty
and
agreeable
though
she
had
lived
very
freely
in
her
younger
days
there
was
her
husband
a
son
and
six
daughters
all
handsome
but
especially
the
harlequin
with
whom
i
was
much
taken
naturally
i
fell
in
love
with
her
but
as
i
was
her
senior
by
thirty
years
and
had
begun
my
addresses
in
a
tone
of
fatherly
affection
a
feeling
of
shame
prevented
my
disclosing
to
her
the
real
state
of
my
heart
four
years
later
she
told
me
herself
that
she
had
guessed
my
real
feelings
and
had
been
amused
by
my
foolish
restraint
a
young
girl
learns
deeper
lessons
from
nature
than
we
men
can
acquire
with
all
our
experience
at
the
easter
of
count
auersperg
the
governor
of
trieste
was
recalled
to
vienna
and
count
wagensberg
took
his
place
his
eldest
daughter
the
countess
lantieri
who
was
a
great
beauty
inspired
me
with
a
passion
which
would
have
made
me
unhappy
if
i
had
not
succeeded
in
hiding
it
under
a
veil
of
the
profoundest
respect
i
celebrated
the
accession
of
the
new
governor
by
some
verses
which
i
had
printed
and
in
which
while
lauding
the
father
i
paid
conspicuous
homage
to
the
charms
of
the
daughter
my
tribute
pleased
them
and
i
became
an
intimate
friend
of
the
count
he
placed
confidence
in
me
with
the
idea
of
my
using
it
to
my
own
advantage
for
though
he
did
not
say
so
openly
i
divined
his
intention
the
venetian
consul
had
told
me
that
he
had
been
vainly
endeavouring
for
the
last
four
years
to
get
the
government
of
trieste
to
arrange
for
the
weekly
diligence
from
trieste
to
mestre
to
pass
by
udine
the
capital
of
the
venetian
friuli
this
alteration
he
had
said
would
greatly
benefit
the
commerce
of
the
two
states
but
the
municipal
council
of
trieste
opposes
it
for
a
plausible
but
ridiculous
reason
these
councillors
in
the
depth
of
their
wisdom
said
that
if
the
venetian
republic
desired
the
alteration
it
would
evidently
be
to
their
advantage
and
consequently
to
the
disadvantage
of
trieste
the
consul
assured
me
that
if
i
could
in
any
way
obtain
the
concession
it
would
weigh
strongly
in
my
favour
with
the
state
inquisitors
and
even
in
the
event
of
my
he
would
represent
my
exertions
in
the
most
favourable
light
i
promised
i
would
think
the
matter
over
finding
myself
high
in
the
governor
favour
i
took
the
opportunity
of
addressing
myself
to
him
on
the
subject
he
had
heard
about
the
matter
and
thought
the
objection
of
the
town
council
absurd
and
even
monstrous
but
he
professed
his
inability
to
do
anything
himself
councillor
rizzi
said
he
is
the
most
obstinate
of
them
all
and
has
led
astray
the
rest
with
his
sophisms
but
do
you
send
me
in
a
memorandum
shewing
that
the
alteration
will
have
a
much
better
effect
on
the
large
commerce
of
trieste
than
on
the
comparatively
trifling
trade
of
udine
i
shall
send
it
into
the
council
without
disclosing
the
authorship
but
backing
it
with
my
authority
and
challenging
the
opposition
to
refute
your
arguments
finally
if
they
do
not
decide
reasonably
i
shall
proclaim
before
them
all
my
intention
to
send
the
memoir
to
vienna
with
my
opinion
on
it
i
felt
confident
of
success
and
wrote
out
a
memoir
full
of
incontrovertible
reasons
in
favour
of
the
proposed
change
my
arguments
gained
the
victory
the
council
were
persuaded
and
count
wagensberg
handed
me
the
decree
which
i
immediately
laid
before
the
venetian
consul
following
his
advice
i
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
the
tribunal
to
the
effect
that
i
was
happy
to
have
given
the
government
a
proof
of
my
zeal
and
an
earnest
of
my
desire
to
be
useful
to
my
country
and
to
be
worthy
of
being
recalled
out
of
regard
for
me
the
count
delayed
the
promulgation
of
the
decree
for
a
week
so
that
the
people
of
udine
heard
the
news
from
venice
before
it
had
reached
trieste
and
everybody
thought
that
the
venetian
government
had
achieved
its
ends
by
bribery
the
secretary
of
the
tribunal
did
not
answer
my
letter
but
he
wrote
to
the
consul
ordering
him
to
give
me
a
hundred
ducats
and
to
inform
me
that
this
present
was
to
encourage
me
to
serve
the
republic
he
added
that
i
might
hope
great
things
from
the
mercy
of
the
inquisitors
if
i
succeeded
in
negotiating
the
armenian
difficulty
the
consul
gave
me
the
requisite
information
and
my
impression
was
that
my
efforts
would
be
in
vain
however
i
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
four
armenian
monks
had
left
the
convent
of
lazarus
at
venice
having
found
the
abbot
tyranny
unbearable
they
had
wealthy
relations
at
constantinople
and
laughed
the
excommunication
of
their
late
tyrant
to
scorn
they
sought
asylum
at
vienna
promising
to
make
themselves
useful
to
the
state
by
establishing
an
armenian
press
to
furnish
all
the
armenian
convents
with
books
they
engaged
to
sink
a
capital
of
a
million
florins
if
they
were
allowed
to
settle
in
austria
to
found
their
press
and
to
buy
or
build
a
convent
where
they
proposed
to
live
in
community
but
without
any
abbot
as
might
be
expected
the
austrian
government
did
not
hesitate
to
grant
their
request
it
did
more
it
gave
them
special
privileges
the
effect
of
this
arrangement
would
be
to
deprive
venice
of
a
lucrative
trade
and
to
place
it
in
the
emperor
dominions
consequently
the
viennese
court
sent
them
to
trieste
with
a
strong
recommendation
to
the
governor
and
they
had
been
there
for
the
past
six
months
the
venetian
government
of
course
wished
to
entice
them
back
to
venice
they
had
vainly
induced
their
late
abbot
to
make
handsome
offers
to
them
and
they
then
proceeded
by
indirect
means
endeavoring
to
stir
up
obstacles
in
their
way
and
to
disgust
them
with
trieste
the
consul
told
me
plainly
that
he
had
not
touched
the
matter
thinking
success
to
be
out
of
the
question
and
he
predicted
that
if
i
attempted
it
i
should
find
myself
in
the
dilemma
of
having
to
solve
the
insoluble
i
felt
the
force
of
the
consul
remark
when
i
reflected
that
i
could
not
rely
on
the
governor
assistance
or
even
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
i
saw
that
i
must
not
let
him
suspect
my
design
for
besides
his
duty
to
his
government
he
was
a
devoted
friend
to
the
interests
of
trieste
and
for
this
reason
a
great
patron
of
the
monks
in
spite
of
these
obstacles
my
nostalgia
made
me
make
acquaintance
with
these
monks
under
pretence
of
inspecting
their
armenian
types
which
they
were
already
casting
in
a
week
or
ten
days
i
became
quite
intimate
with
them
one
day
i
said
that
they
were
bound
in
honour
to
return
to
the
obedience
of
their
abbot
if
only
to
annul
his
sentence
of
excommunication
the
most
obstinate
of
them
told
me
that
the
abbot
had
behaved
more
like
a
despot
than
a
father
and
had
thus
absolved
them
from
their
obedience
besides
he
said
no
rascally
priest
has
any
right
to
cut
off
good
christians
from
communion
with
the
saviour
and
we
are
sure
that
our
patriarch
will
give
us
absolution
and
send
us
some
more
monks
i
could
make
no
objection
to
these
arguments
however
i
asked
on
another
occasion
on
what
conditions
they
would
return
to
venice
the
most
sensible
of
them
said
that
in
the
first
place
the
abbot
must
withdraw
the
four
hundred
thousand
ducats
which
he
had
entrusted
to
the
marquis
serpos
at
four
per
cent
this
sum
was
the
capital
from
which
the
income
of
the
convent
of
lazarus
was
derived
the
abbot
had
no
right
whatever
to
dispose
of
it
even
with
the
consent
of
a
majority
among
the
monks
if
the
marquis
became
bankrupt
the
convent
would
be
utterly
destitute
the
marquis
was
an
armenian
diamond
merchant
and
a
great
friend
of
the
abbot
i
then
asked
the
monks
what
were
the
other
conditions
and
they
replied
that
these
were
some
matters
of
discipline
which
might
easily
be
settled
they
would
give
me
a
written
statement
of
their
grievances
as
soon
as
i
could
assure
them
that
the
marquis
serpos
was
no
longer
in
possession
of
their
funds
i
embodied
my
negotiations
in
writing
and
sent
the
document
to
the
inquisitors
by
the
consul
in
six
weeks
i
received
an
answer
to
the
effect
that
the
abbot
saw
his
way
to
arranging
the
money
difficulty
but
that
he
must
see
a
statement
of
the
reforms
demanded
before
doing
so
this
decided
me
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
but
a
few
words
from
count
wagensberg
made
me
throw
it
up
without
further
delay
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
knew
of
my
attempts
to
reconcile
the
four
monks
with
their
abbot
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
sorry
to
hear
the
report
as
my
success
would
do
harm
to
a
country
where
i
lived
and
where
i
was
treated
as
a
friend
i
immediately
told
him
the
whole
story
assuring
him
that
i
would
never
have
begun
the
negotiation
if
i
had
not
been
certain
of
failure
for
i
heard
on
undoubted
authority
that
serpos
could
not
possibly
restore
the
four
hundred
thousand
ducats
this
explanation
thoroughly
dissipated
any
cloud
that
might
have
arisen
between
us
the
armenians
bought
councillor
rizzi
house
for
thirty
thousand
florins
here
they
established
themselves
and
i
visited
them
from
time
to
time
without
saying
anything
more
about
venice
count
wagensberg
gave
me
another
proof
of
his
friendship
unhappily
for
me
he
died
during
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
at
the
age
of
fifty
one
morning
he
summoned
me
and
i
found
him
perusing
a
document
he
had
just
received
from
vienna
he
told
me
he
was
sorry
i
did
not
read
german
but
that
he
would
tell
me
the
contents
of
the
paper
here
he
continued
you
will
be
able
to
serve
your
country
without
in
any
way
injuring
austria
i
am
going
to
confide
in
you
a
state
secret
it
being
understood
of
course
that
my
name
is
never
to
be
mentioned
which
ought
to
be
greatly
to
your
advantage
whether
you
succeed
or
fail
at
all
hazards
your
patriotism
your
prompt
action
and
your
cleverness
in
obtaining
such
information
will
be
made
manifest
remember
you
must
never
divulge
your
sources
of
information
only
tell
your
government
that
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
the
authenticity
of
the
statement
you
make
you
must
know
he
continued
that
all
the
commodities
we
export
to
lombardy
pass
through
venice
where
they
have
to
pay
duty
such
has
long
been
the
custom
and
it
may
still
be
so
if
the
venetian
government
will
consent
to
reduce
the
duty
of
four
per
cent
to
two
per
cent
a
plan
has
been
brought
before
the
notice
of
the
austrian
court
and
it
has
been
eagerly
accepted
i
have
received
certain
orders
on
the
matter
which
i
shall
put
into
execution
without
giving
any
warning
to
the
venetian
government
in
future
all
goods
for
lombardy
will
be
embarked
here
and
disembarked
at
mezzola
without
troubling
the
republic
mezzola
is
in
the
territories
of
the
duke
of
modem
a
ship
can
cross
the
gulf
in
the
night
and
our
goods
will
be
placed
in
storehouses
which
will
be
erected
in
this
way
we
shall
shorten
the
journey
and
decrease
the
freights
and
the
modenese
government
will
be
satisfied
with
a
trifling
sum
barely
equivalent
to
a
fourth
of
what
we
pay
to
venice
in
spite
of
all
this
i
feel
sure
that
if
the
venetian
government
wrote
to
the
austrian
council
of
commerce
expressing
their
willingness
to
take
two
per
cent
henceforth
the
proposal
would
be
accepted
for
we
austrians
dislike
novelties
i
shall
not
lay
the
matter
before
the
town
council
for
four
or
five
days
as
there
is
no
hurry
for
us
but
you
had
better
make
haste
that
you
may
be
the
first
to
inform
your
government
of
the
matter
if
everything
goes
as
i
should
wish
i
hope
to
receive
an
order
from
vienna
suspending
the
decree
just
as
i
am
about
to
make
it
public
next
morning
the
governor
was
delighted
to
hear
that
everything
had
been
finished
before
midnight
he
assured
me
that
the
consul
should
not
have
official
information
before
saturday
in
the
meanwhile
the
uneasy
state
of
mind
was
quite
a
trouble
to
me
for
i
could
not
do
anything
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
saturday
came
and
councillor
rizzi
told
me
the
news
at
the
club
he
seemed
in
high
spirits
over
it
and
said
that
the
loss
of
venice
was
the
gain
of
trieste
the
consul
came
in
just
then
and
said
that
the
loss
would
be
a
mere
trifle
for
venice
while
the
would
cost
more
to
trieste
than
ten
years
duty
the
consul
seemed
to
enjoy
the
whole
thing
but
that
was
the
part
he
had
to
play
in
all
small
trading
towns
like
trieste
people
make
a
great
account
of
trifles
i
went
to
dine
with
the
consul
who
privately
confessed
his
doubts
and
fears
on
the
matter
i
asked
him
how
the
venetians
would
parry
the
blow
and
he
replied
they
will
have
a
number
of
very
learned
consultations
and
then
they
will
do
nothing
at
all
and
the
austrians
will
send
their
goods
wherever
they
please
but
the
government
is
such
a
wise
one
or
rather
has
the
reputation
of
wisdom
then
you
think
it
lives
on
its
reputation
yes
like
all
your
mouldy
institutions
they
continue
to
be
simply
because
they
have
been
old
governments
are
like
those
ancient
dykes
which
are
rotten
at
the
base
and
only
stay
in
position
by
their
weight
and
bulk
the
consul
was
in
the
right
he
wrote
to
his
chief
the
same
day
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
he
heard
that
their
excellencies
had
received
information
of
the
matter
some
time
ago
by
extraordinary
channels
for
the
present
his
duties
would
be
confined
to
sending
in
any
additional
information
on
the
same
subject
i
told
you
so
said
the
consul
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
wisdom
of
our
sages
i
think
bedlam
of
charenton
were
their
best
lodging
in
three
weeks
the
consul
received
orders
to
give
me
another
grant
of
a
hundred
ducats
and
to
allow
me
ten
sequins
a
month
to
encourage
me
to
deserve
well
of
the
state
from
that
time
i
felt
sure
i
should
be
allowed
to
return
in
the
course
of
the
year
but
i
was
mistaken
for
i
had
to
wait
till
the
year
following
this
new
present
and
the
monthly
payment
of
ten
sequins
put
me
at
my
ease
for
i
had
expensive
tastes
of
which
i
could
not
cure
myself
i
felt
pleased
at
the
thought
that
i
was
now
in
the
pay
of
the
tribunal
which
had
punished
me
and
which
i
had
defied
it
seemed
to
me
a
triumph
and
i
determined
to
do
all
in
my
power
for
the
republic
here
i
must
relate
an
amusing
incident
which
delighted
everyone
in
trieste
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
summer
i
had
been
eating
sardines
by
the
and
when
i
came
home
at
ten
at
night
i
was
astonished
to
be
greeted
by
a
girl
whom
i
recognized
as
count
strasoldo
maid
the
count
was
a
handsome
young
man
but
poor
like
most
of
that
name
he
was
fond
of
expensive
pleasures
and
was
consequently
heavily
in
debt
he
had
a
small
appointment
which
brought
him
in
an
income
of
six
hundred
florins
and
he
had
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
spending
a
year
pay
in
three
months
he
had
agreeable
manners
and
a
generous
disposition
and
i
had
supped
with
him
in
company
with
baron
pittoni
several
times
he
had
a
girl
in
his
service
who
was
exquisitely
pretty
but
none
of
the
friends
attempted
her
as
he
was
very
jealous
like
the
rest
i
had
seen
and
admired
her
i
had
congratulated
the
count
on
the
possession
of
such
a
treasure
in
her
presence
but
i
had
never
addressed
a
word
to
her
strasoldo
had
just
been
summoned
to
vienna
by
count
auersperg
who
liked
him
and
had
promised
to
do
what
he
could
for
him
he
had
got
an
employment
in
poland
his
furniture
had
been
sold
he
had
taken
leave
of
everyone
and
nobody
doubted
that
he
would
take
his
pretty
maid
with
him
i
thought
so
too
for
i
had
been
to
wish
him
a
pleasant
journey
that
morning
and
my
astonishment
at
finding
the
girl
in
my
room
may
be
imagined
what
do
you
want
my
dear
i
asked
forgive
me
sir
but
i
do
want
to
go
with
strasoldo
and
i
thought
you
would
protect
me
nobody
will
be
able
to
guess
where
i
am
and
strasoldo
will
be
obliged
to
go
by
himself
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
drive
me
away
no
dearest
i
promise
you
i
will
go
away
for
strasoldo
is
going
to
leave
at
my
lovely
leuzica
this
was
her
name
no
one
would
refuse
you
an
asylum
i
least
of
all
you
are
safe
here
and
nobody
shall
come
in
without
your
leave
i
am
only
too
happy
that
you
came
to
me
but
if
it
is
true
that
the
count
is
your
lover
you
may
be
sure
he
will
not
go
so
easily
he
will
stay
the
whole
of
at
least
in
the
hope
of
finding
you
again
no
doubt
he
will
look
for
me
everywhere
but
here
will
you
promise
not
to
make
me
go
with
him
even
if
he
guesses
that
i
am
with
you
i
swear
i
will
not
then
i
am
satisfied
but
you
will
have
to
share
my
bed
if
i
shall
not
inconvenience
you
i
agree
with
all
my
heart
you
shall
see
whether
you
inconvenience
me
or
not
undress
quick
but
where
are
your
things
all
that
i
have
is
in
a
small
trunk
behind
the
count
carriage
but
i
do
trouble
myself
about
it
the
poor
count
must
be
raging
at
this
very
moment
no
for
he
will
not
come
home
till
midnight
he
is
supping
with
madame
bissolotti
who
is
in
love
with
him
in
the
meantime
leuzica
had
undressed
and
got
into
bed
in
a
moment
i
was
beside
her
and
after
the
severe
regimen
of
the
last
eight
months
i
spent
a
delicious
night
in
her
arms
for
of
late
my
pleasures
had
been
few
leuzica
was
a
perfect
beauty
and
worthy
to
be
a
king
mistress
and
if
i
had
been
rich
i
would
have
set
up
a
household
that
i
might
retain
her
in
my
service
we
did
not
awake
till
seven
she
got
up
and
on
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
strasoldo
carriage
waiting
at
the
door
i
confronted
her
by
saying
that
as
long
as
she
liked
to
stay
with
me
no
one
could
force
her
away
i
was
vexed
that
i
had
no
closet
in
my
room
as
i
could
not
hide
her
from
the
waiter
who
would
bring
us
coffee
we
accordingly
dispensed
with
breakfast
but
i
had
to
find
out
some
way
of
feeding
her
i
thought
i
had
plenty
of
time
before
me
but
i
was
wrong
at
ten
i
saw
strasoldo
and
his
friend
pittoni
coming
into
the
inn
they
spoke
to
the
landlord
and
seemed
to
be
searching
the
whole
place
passing
from
one
room
to
another
i
laughed
and
told
leuzica
that
they
were
looking
for
her
and
that
our
turn
would
doubtless
come
before
long
remember
your
promise
said
she
you
may
be
sure
of
that
the
tone
in
which
this
remark
was
delivered
comforted
her
and
she
exclaimed
well
well
let
them
come
they
will
get
nothing
by
it
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
me
and
begging
them
to
excuse
my
not
asking
them
in
as
there
was
a
contraband
commodity
in
my
room
only
tell
me
that
it
is
not
my
maid
said
strasoldo
in
a
pitiable
voice
we
are
sure
she
is
here
as
the
sentinel
at
the
gate
saw
her
come
in
at
ten
you
are
right
the
fair
leuzica
is
at
this
moment
in
my
room
i
have
given
her
my
word
of
honour
that
no
violence
shall
be
used
and
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
keep
my
word
i
shall
certainly
not
attempt
any
violence
but
i
am
sure
she
would
come
of
her
own
free
will
if
i
could
speak
to
her
i
will
ask
her
if
she
wishes
to
see
you
wait
a
moment
leuzica
had
been
listening
to
our
conversation
and
when
i
opened
the
door
she
told
me
that
i
could
let
them
in
as
soon
as
strasoldo
appeared
she
asked
him
proudly
if
she
was
under
any
obligations
to
him
if
she
had
stolen
anything
from
him
and
if
she
was
not
perfectly
free
to
leave
him
when
she
liked
the
poor
count
replied
mildly
that
on
the
contrary
it
was
he
who
owed
her
a
year
wages
and
had
her
box
in
his
possession
but
that
she
should
not
have
left
him
without
giving
any
reason
the
only
reason
is
that
i
do
want
to
go
to
vienna
she
replied
i
told
you
so
a
week
ago
if
you
are
an
honest
man
you
will
leave
me
my
trunk
and
as
to
my
wages
you
can
send
them
to
me
at
my
aunt
at
laibach
if
you
have
got
any
money
now
i
pitied
strasoldo
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
he
prayed
and
entreated
and
finally
wept
like
a
child
however
pittoni
roused
my
choler
by
saying
that
i
ought
to
drive
the
slut
out
of
my
room
you
are
not
the
man
to
tell
me
what
i
ought
and
what
i
ought
not
to
do
i
replied
and
after
i
have
received
her
in
my
apartments
you
ought
to
moderate
your
expressions
seeing
that
i
stood
on
my
dignity
he
laughed
and
asked
me
if
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
in
so
short
a
time
strasoldo
here
broke
in
by
saying
he
was
sure
she
had
not
slept
with
me
that
where
you
are
mistaken
said
she
for
there
only
one
bed
and
i
did
not
sleep
on
the
floor
they
found
prayers
and
reproaches
alike
useless
and
left
us
at
noon
leuzica
was
profuse
in
her
expressions
of
gratitude
to
me
there
was
no
longer
any
mystery
so
i
boldly
ordered
dinner
for
two
and
promised
that
she
should
remain
with
me
till
the
count
had
left
trieste
at
three
the
venetian
consul
came
saying
that
count
strasoldo
had
begged
him
to
use
his
good
offices
with
me
to
persuade
me
to
deliver
up
the
fair
leuzica
you
must
speak
to
the
girl
herself
i
replied
she
came
here
and
stays
here
of
her
own
free
will
when
the
worthy
man
had
heard
the
girl
story
he
went
away
saying
that
we
had
the
right
on
our
side
in
the
evening
a
porter
brought
her
trunk
and
at
this
she
seemed
touched
but
not
repentant
leuzica
supped
with
me
and
again
shared
my
couch
the
count
left
trieste
at
as
soon
as
i
was
sure
that
he
was
gone
i
took
a
carriage
and
escorted
the
fair
leuzica
two
stages
on
her
way
to
laibach
we
dined
together
and
i
left
her
in
the
care
of
a
friend
of
hers
everybody
said
i
had
acted
properly
and
even
pittoni
confessed
that
in
my
place
he
would
have
done
the
same
poor
strasoldo
came
to
a
bad
end
he
got
into
debt
committed
peculation
and
had
to
escape
into
turkey
and
embrace
islam
to
avoid
the
penalty
of
death
about
this
time
the
venetian
general
palmanova
accompanied
by
the
procurator
erizzo
came
to
trieste
to
visit
the
governor
count
wagensberg
in
the
afternoon
the
count
presented
me
to
the
patricians
who
seemed
astonished
to
see
me
at
trieste
the
procurator
asked
me
if
i
amused
myself
as
well
as
i
had
done
at
paris
sixteen
years
ago
and
i
told
him
that
sixteen
years
more
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
less
forced
me
to
live
in
a
different
fashion
while
we
were
talking
the
consul
came
in
to
announce
that
the
felucca
was
ready
madame
de
lantieri
as
well
as
her
father
pressed
me
to
join
the
party
i
gave
a
bow
which
might
mean
either
no
or
yes
and
asked
the
consul
what
the
party
was
he
told
me
that
they
were
going
to
see
a
venetian
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
his
excellence
there
being
the
captain
i
immediately
turned
to
the
countess
and
smilingly
professed
my
regret
that
i
was
unable
to
set
foot
on
venetian
soil
everybody
exclaimed
at
me
you
have
nothing
to
fear
you
are
with
honest
people
your
suspicion
is
quite
offensive
that
is
all
very
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
i
will
come
with
all
my
heart
if
your
excellences
will
assure
me
that
my
joining
this
little
party
will
not
be
known
to
the
state
inquisitors
possibly
by
this
was
enough
everybody
looked
at
me
in
silence
and
no
objections
could
be
found
to
my
argument
the
captain
of
the
vessel
who
did
not
know
me
spoke
a
few
whispered
words
to
the
others
and
then
they
left
the
next
day
the
consul
told
me
that
the
captain
had
praised
my
prudence
in
declining
to
go
on
board
as
if
anyone
had
chanced
to
tell
him
my
name
and
my
case
whilst
i
was
on
his
ship
it
would
have
been
his
duty
to
detain
me
when
i
told
the
governor
of
this
remark
he
replied
gravely
that
he
should
not
have
allowed
the
ship
to
leave
the
harbour
i
saw
the
procurator
erizzo
the
same
evening
and
he
congratulated
me
on
my
discretion
telling
me
he
would
take
care
to
let
the
tribunal
know
how
i
respected
its
decisions
about
this
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
beautiful
venetian
who
visited
trieste
with
several
of
her
admirers
she
was
of
the
noble
family
of
bon
and
had
married
count
romili
de
bergamo
who
left
her
free
to
do
whatever
she
liked
she
drew
behind
her
triumphal
chariot
an
old
general
count
bourghausen
a
famous
rake
who
had
deserted
mars
for
the
past
ten
years
in
order
to
devote
his
remaining
days
to
the
service
of
venus
he
was
a
delightful
man
and
we
became
friends
ten
years
later
he
was
of
service
to
me
as
my
readers
will
find
in
the
next
volume
which
may
perhaps
be
the
last
chapter
xxii
some
adventures
at
trieste
i
am
of
service
to
the
venetian
government
my
expedition
to
gorice
and
my
return
to
trieste
i
find
irene
as
an
actress
and
expert
gamester
some
of
the
ladies
of
trieste
thought
they
would
like
to
act
a
french
play
and
i
was
made
stage
manager
i
had
not
only
to
choose
the
pieces
but
to
distribute
the
parts
the
latter
being
a
duty
of
infinite
irksomeness
all
the
actresses
were
new
to
the
boards
and
i
had
immense
trouble
in
hearing
them
repeat
their
parts
which
they
seemed
unable
to
learn
by
heart
it
is
a
fact
that
the
revolution
which
is
really
wanted
in
italy
is
in
female
education
the
very
best
families
with
few
exceptions
are
satisfied
with
shutting
up
their
daughters
in
a
convent
for
several
years
till
the
time
comes
for
them
to
marry
some
man
whom
they
never
see
till
the
eve
or
the
day
of
their
marriage
as
a
consequence
we
have
the
and
in
italy
as
in
france
the
idea
that
our
nobles
are
the
sons
of
their
nominal
fathers
is
a
purely
conventional
one
what
do
girls
learn
in
convents
especially
in
italian
convents
a
few
mechanical
acts
of
devotion
and
outward
forms
very
little
real
religion
a
good
deal
of
deceit
often
profligate
habits
a
little
reading
and
writing
many
useless
accomplishments
small
music
and
less
drawing
no
history
no
geography
or
mythology
hardly
any
mathematics
and
nothing
to
make
a
girl
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mother
as
for
foreign
languages
they
are
unheard
of
our
own
italian
is
so
soft
that
any
other
tongue
is
hard
to
acquire
and
the
far
habit
is
an
obstacle
to
all
assiduous
study
i
write
down
these
truths
in
spite
of
my
patriotism
i
know
that
if
any
of
my
come
to
read
me
they
will
be
very
angry
but
i
shall
be
beyond
the
reach
of
all
anger
to
return
to
our
theatricals
as
i
could
not
make
my
actresses
get
their
parts
letter
perfect
i
became
their
prompter
and
found
out
by
experience
all
the
ungratefulness
of
the
position
the
actors
never
acknowledged
their
debt
to
the
prompter
and
put
down
to
his
account
all
the
mistakes
they
make
a
spanish
doctor
is
almost
as
badly
off
if
his
patient
recovers
the
cure
is
set
down
to
the
credit
of
one
saint
or
another
but
if
he
dies
the
physician
is
blamed
for
his
unskilful
treatment
a
handsome
negress
who
served
the
prettiest
of
my
actresses
to
whom
i
shewed
great
attentions
said
to
me
one
day
i
ca
make
out
how
you
can
be
so
much
in
love
with
my
mistress
who
is
as
white
as
the
devil
have
you
never
loved
a
white
man
i
asked
yes
said
she
but
only
because
i
had
no
negro
to
whom
i
should
certainly
have
given
the
preference
soon
after
the
negress
became
mine
and
i
found
out
the
falsity
of
the
axiom
lucerna
nullum
discrimen
inter
feminas
for
even
in
the
darkness
a
man
would
know
a
black
woman
from
a
white
one
i
feel
quite
sure
myself
that
the
negroes
are
a
distinct
species
from
ourselves
there
is
one
essential
difference
leaving
the
colour
out
of
account
namely
that
an
african
woman
can
either
conceive
or
not
and
can
conceive
a
boy
or
a
girl
no
doubt
my
readers
will
disbelieve
this
assertion
but
their
incredulity
would
cease
if
i
instructed
them
in
the
mysterious
science
of
the
negresses
count
rosenberg
grand
chamberlain
of
the
emperor
came
on
a
visit
to
trieste
in
company
with
an
abbe
casti
whose
acquaintance
i
wished
to
make
on
account
of
some
extremely
blasphemous
poems
he
had
written
however
i
was
disappointed
and
instead
of
a
man
of
parts
i
found
the
abbe
to
be
an
impudent
worthless
fellow
whose
only
merit
was
a
knack
of
versification
count
rosenberg
took
the
abbe
with
him
because
he
was
useful
in
the
capacities
of
a
fool
and
a
well
suited
to
his
morals
though
by
no
means
agreeable
to
his
ecclesiastical
status
in
those
days
syphilis
had
not
completely
destroyed
his
uvula
i
heard
that
this
shameless
profligate
this
paltry
poetaster
had
been
named
poet
to
the
emperor
what
a
dishonour
to
the
memory
of
the
great
metastasio
a
man
free
from
all
vices
adorned
with
all
virtues
and
of
the
most
singular
ability
casti
had
neither
a
fine
style
nor
a
knowledge
of
dramatic
requirements
as
appears
from
two
or
three
comic
operas
composed
by
him
in
which
the
reader
will
find
nothing
but
foolish
buffooneries
badly
put
together
in
one
of
these
comic
operas
he
makes
use
of
slander
against
king
theodore
and
the
venetian
republic
which
he
turns
into
ridicule
by
means
of
pitiful
lies
in
another
piece
called
the
cave
of
trophonius
casti
made
himself
the
of
the
literary
world
by
making
a
display
of
useless
learning
which
contributes
nothing
towards
the
plot
among
the
persons
of
quality
who
came
to
gorice
i
met
a
certain
count
torriano
who
persuaded
me
to
spend
the
autumn
with
him
at
a
country
house
of
his
six
miles
from
gorice
if
i
had
listened
to
the
voice
of
my
good
genius
i
should
certainly
never
have
gone
the
count
was
under
thirty
and
was
not
married
he
could
not
exactly
be
called
ugly
in
spite
of
his
hangdog
countenance
in
which
i
saw
the
outward
signs
of
cruelty
disloyalty
treason
pride
brutal
sensuality
hatred
and
jealousy
the
mixture
of
bad
qualities
was
such
an
appalling
one
that
i
thought
his
physiognomy
was
at
fault
and
the
goods
better
than
the
sign
he
asked
me
to
come
and
see
him
so
graciously
that
i
concluded
that
the
man
gave
the
lie
to
his
face
i
asked
about
him
before
accepting
the
invitation
and
i
heard
nothing
but
good
people
certainly
said
he
was
fond
of
the
fair
sex
and
was
a
fierce
avenger
of
any
wrong
done
to
him
but
not
thinking
either
of
these
characteristics
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
i
accepted
his
invitation
he
told
me
that
he
would
expect
me
to
meet
him
at
gorice
on
the
first
day
of
september
and
that
the
next
day
we
would
leave
for
his
estate
in
consequence
of
torriano
invitation
i
took
leave
of
everybody
especially
of
count
wagensberg
who
had
a
serious
attack
of
that
malady
which
yields
so
easily
to
mercury
when
it
is
administered
by
a
skilled
hand
but
which
kills
the
unfortunate
who
falls
amongst
quacks
such
was
the
fate
of
the
poor
count
he
died
a
month
after
i
had
left
trieste
i
left
trieste
in
the
morning
dined
at
proseco
and
reached
gorice
in
good
time
i
called
at
count
louis
torriano
mansion
but
was
told
he
was
out
however
they
allowed
me
to
deposit
what
little
luggage
i
had
when
i
informed
them
that
the
count
had
invited
me
i
then
went
to
see
count
torres
and
stayed
with
him
till
when
i
got
back
to
the
count
i
was
told
he
was
in
the
country
and
would
not
be
back
till
the
next
day
and
that
in
the
meantime
my
trunks
had
been
taken
to
the
inn
where
a
room
and
supper
had
been
ordered
i
was
extremely
astonished
and
went
to
the
inn
where
i
was
served
with
a
bad
supper
in
an
uncomfortable
room
however
i
supposed
that
the
count
had
been
unable
to
accommodate
me
in
his
house
and
i
excused
him
though
i
wished
he
had
forewarned
me
i
could
not
understand
how
a
gentleman
who
has
a
house
and
invites
a
friend
can
be
without
a
room
wherein
to
lodge
him
next
morning
count
torriano
came
to
see
me
thanked
me
for
my
punctuality
congratulated
himself
on
the
pleasure
he
expected
to
derive
from
my
society
and
told
me
he
was
very
sorry
we
could
not
start
for
two
days
as
a
suit
was
to
be
heard
the
next
day
between
himself
and
a
rascally
old
farmer
who
was
trying
to
cheat
him
well
well
said
i
i
will
go
and
hear
the
pleadings
it
will
be
an
amusement
for
me
soon
after
he
took
his
leave
without
asking
me
where
i
intended
dining
or
apologizing
for
not
having
accommodated
me
himself
i
could
not
make
him
out
i
thought
he
might
have
taken
offence
at
my
descending
at
his
doors
without
having
given
him
any
warning
come
come
casanova
i
said
to
myself
you
may
be
all
abroad
knowledge
of
character
is
an
unfathomable
gulf
we
thought
we
had
studied
it
deeply
but
there
is
still
more
to
learn
we
shall
see
he
may
have
said
nothing
out
of
delicacy
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
found
wanting
in
politeness
though
indeed
i
am
puzzled
to
know
what
i
have
done
amiss
i
dined
by
myself
made
calls
in
the
afternoon
and
supped
with
count
tomes
i
told
him
that
i
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
eloquence
of
the
bar
of
gorice
the
next
day
i
shall
be
there
too
said
he
as
i
am
curious
to
see
what
sort
of
a
face
torriano
will
put
on
it
if
the
countryman
wins
i
know
something
about
the
case
he
continued
and
torriano
is
sure
of
victory
unless
the
documents
attesting
the
farmer
indebtedness
happen
to
be
forgeries
on
the
other
hand
the
farmer
ought
to
win
unless
it
can
be
shewn
that
the
receipts
signed
by
torriano
are
forgeries
the
farmer
has
lost
in
the
first
court
and
in
the
second
court
but
he
has
paid
the
costs
and
appealed
from
both
though
he
is
a
poor
man
if
he
loses
he
will
not
only
be
a
ruined
man
but
be
sentenced
to
penal
servitude
while
if
he
wins
torriano
should
be
sent
to
the
galleys
together
with
his
counsel
who
has
deserved
this
fate
many
times
before
i
knew
count
tomes
passed
for
somewhat
of
a
so
his
remarks
made
little
impression
on
me
beyond
whetting
my
curiosity
the
next
day
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
appear
in
the
court
where
i
found
the
bench
plaintiff
and
defendant
and
the
barristers
already
assembled
the
farmer
counsel
was
an
old
man
who
looked
honest
while
the
had
all
the
impudence
of
a
practised
knave
the
count
sat
beside
him
smiling
disdainfully
as
if
he
was
lowering
himself
to
strive
with
a
miserable
peasant
whom
he
had
already
twice
vanquished
the
farmer
sat
by
his
wife
his
son
and
two
daughters
and
had
that
air
of
modest
assurance
which
indicates
resignation
and
a
good
conscience
i
wondered
how
such
honest
people
could
have
lost
in
two
courts
i
was
sure
their
cause
must
be
a
just
one
they
were
all
poorly
clad
and
from
their
downcast
eyes
and
their
humble
looks
i
guessed
them
to
be
the
victims
of
oppression
each
barrister
could
speak
for
two
hours
the
farmer
advocate
spoke
for
thirty
minutes
which
he
occupied
by
putting
in
the
various
receipts
bearing
the
count
signature
up
to
the
time
when
he
had
dismissed
the
farmer
because
he
would
not
prostitute
his
daughters
to
him
he
then
continued
speaking
with
calm
precision
to
point
out
the
anachronisms
and
contradictions
in
the
count
books
which
made
his
client
a
debtor
and
stated
that
his
client
was
in
a
position
to
prosecute
the
two
forgers
who
had
been
employed
to
compass
the
ruin
of
an
honest
family
whose
only
crime
was
poverty
he
ended
his
speech
by
an
appeal
for
costs
in
all
the
suits
and
for
compensation
for
loss
of
time
and
defamation
of
character
the
harangue
of
the
count
advocate
would
have
lasted
more
than
two
hours
if
the
court
had
not
silenced
him
he
indulged
in
a
torrent
of
abuse
against
the
other
barrister
the
experts
in
and
the
peasant
whom
he
threatened
with
a
speedy
consignment
to
the
galleys
the
pleadings
would
have
wearied
me
if
i
had
been
a
blind
man
but
as
it
was
i
amused
myself
by
a
scrutiny
of
the
various
physiognomies
before
me
my
host
face
remained
smiling
and
impudent
through
it
all
the
pleadings
over
the
court
was
cleared
and
we
awaited
the
sentence
in
the
adjoining
room
the
peasant
and
his
family
sat
in
a
corner
apart
sad
sorry
and
comfortless
with
no
friend
to
speak
a
consoling
word
while
the
count
was
surrounded
by
a
courtly
throng
who
assured
him
that
with
such
a
case
he
could
not
possibly
lose
but
that
if
the
judges
did
deliver
judgment
against
him
he
should
pay
the
peasant
and
force
him
to
prove
the
alleged
forgery
i
listened
in
profound
silence
sympathising
with
the
countryman
rather
than
my
host
whom
i
believed
to
be
a
scoundrel
though
i
took
care
not
to
say
so
count
torres
who
was
a
deadly
foe
to
all
prudence
and
discretion
asked
me
my
opinion
of
the
case
and
i
whispered
that
i
thought
the
count
should
lose
even
if
he
were
in
the
right
on
account
of
the
infamous
apostrophes
of
his
counsel
who
deserved
to
have
his
ears
cut
off
or
to
stand
in
the
pillory
for
six
months
and
the
client
too
said
tomes
aloud
but
nobody
had
heard
what
i
had
said
after
we
had
waited
for
an
hour
the
clerk
of
the
court
came
in
with
two
papers
one
of
which
he
gave
to
the
peasant
counsel
and
the
other
to
torriano
torriano
read
it
to
himself
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
then
read
it
aloud
the
court
condemned
the
count
to
recognize
the
peasant
as
his
creditor
to
pay
all
costs
and
to
give
him
a
year
wages
as
damages
the
peasant
right
to
appeal
ad
minimum
on
account
of
any
other
complaints
he
might
have
being
reserved
the
advocate
looked
downcast
but
torriano
consoled
him
by
a
fee
of
six
sequins
and
everybody
went
away
i
remained
with
the
defendant
and
asked
him
if
he
meant
to
appeal
to
vienna
i
shall
appeal
in
another
sort
said
he
but
i
did
not
ask
him
what
he
meant
we
left
gorice
the
next
morning
my
landlord
gave
me
the
bill
and
told
me
he
had
received
instructions
not
to
insist
on
my
paying
it
if
i
made
any
difficulty
as
in
that
case
the
count
would
pay
himself
this
struck
me
as
somewhat
eccentric
but
i
only
laughed
however
the
specimens
i
had
seen
of
his
character
made
me
imagine
that
i
was
going
to
spend
six
weeks
with
a
dangerous
original
in
two
hours
we
were
at
spessa
and
alighted
at
a
large
house
with
nothing
distinguished
about
it
from
an
architectural
point
of
view
we
went
up
to
the
count
room
which
was
tolerably
furnished
and
after
shewing
me
over
the
house
he
took
me
to
my
own
room
it
was
on
the
ground
floor
stuffy
dark
and
ill
furnished
ah
said
he
this
is
the
room
my
poor
old
father
used
to
love
to
sit
in
like
you
he
was
very
fond
of
study
you
may
be
sure
of
enjoying
perfect
liberty
here
for
you
will
see
no
one
we
dined
late
and
consequently
no
supper
was
served
the
eating
and
the
wine
were
tolerable
and
so
was
the
company
of
a
priest
who
held
the
position
of
the
count
steward
but
i
was
disgusted
at
hearing
the
count
who
ate
ravenously
reproach
me
with
eating
too
slowly
when
we
rose
from
table
he
told
me
he
had
a
lot
to
do
and
that
we
should
see
each
other
the
next
day
i
went
to
my
room
to
put
things
in
order
and
to
get
out
my
papers
i
was
then
working
at
the
second
volume
of
the
polish
troubles
in
the
evening
i
asked
for
a
light
as
it
was
growing
dark
and
presently
a
servant
came
with
one
candle
i
was
indignant
they
ought
to
have
given
me
wax
lights
or
a
lamp
at
least
however
i
made
no
complaint
merely
asking
one
of
the
servants
if
i
was
to
rely
on
the
services
of
any
amongst
them
our
master
has
given
us
no
instructions
on
the
subject
but
of
course
we
will
wait
on
you
whenever
you
call
us
this
would
have
been
a
troublesome
task
as
there
was
no
bell
and
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
wander
all
over
the
house
to
search
the
courtyard
and
perhaps
the
road
whenever
i
wanted
a
servant
and
who
will
do
my
room
i
asked
the
maid
then
she
has
a
key
of
her
own
there
is
no
need
for
a
key
as
your
door
has
no
lock
but
you
can
bolt
yourself
in
at
night
i
could
only
laugh
whether
from
ill
humour
or
amusement
i
really
can
not
say
however
i
made
no
remark
to
the
man
i
began
my
task
but
in
half
an
hour
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
put
out
the
candle
whilst
snuffing
it
i
could
not
roam
about
the
house
in
the
dark
searching
for
a
light
as
i
did
not
know
my
way
so
i
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
more
inclined
to
swear
than
to
laugh
fortunately
the
bed
was
a
good
one
and
as
i
had
expected
it
to
be
uncomfortable
i
went
to
sleep
in
a
more
tranquil
humour
in
the
morning
nobody
came
to
attend
on
me
so
i
got
up
and
after
putting
away
my
papers
i
went
to
say
good
morning
to
my
host
in
and
nightcap
i
found
him
under
the
hand
of
one
of
his
men
who
served
him
as
a
valet
i
told
him
i
had
slept
well
and
had
come
to
breakfast
with
him
but
he
said
he
never
took
breakfast
and
asked
me
politely
enough
not
to
trouble
to
come
and
see
him
in
the
morning
as
he
was
always
engaged
with
his
tenants
who
were
a
pack
of
thieves
he
then
added
that
as
i
took
breakfast
he
would
give
orders
to
the
cook
to
send
me
up
coffee
whenever
i
liked
you
will
also
be
kind
enough
to
tell
your
man
to
give
me
a
touch
with
his
comb
after
he
has
done
with
you
i
wonder
you
did
not
bring
a
servant
if
i
had
guessed
that
i
should
be
troubling
you
i
should
certainly
have
brought
one
it
will
not
trouble
me
but
you
for
you
will
be
kept
waiting
not
at
all
another
thing
i
want
is
a
lock
to
my
door
for
i
have
important
papers
for
which
i
am
responsible
and
i
can
not
lock
them
up
in
my
trunk
whenever
i
leave
my
room
everything
is
safe
in
my
house
of
course
but
you
see
how
absurd
it
would
be
for
you
to
be
answerable
in
case
any
of
my
papers
were
missing
i
might
be
in
the
greatest
distress
and
yet
i
should
never
tell
you
of
it
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
and
then
ordered
his
man
to
tell
the
priest
to
put
a
lock
on
my
door
and
give
me
the
key
while
he
was
thinking
i
noticed
a
taper
and
a
book
on
the
table
beside
his
bed
i
went
up
to
it
and
asked
politely
if
i
might
see
what
kind
of
reading
had
beguiled
him
to
sleep
he
replied
as
politely
requesting
me
not
to
touch
it
i
withdrew
immediately
telling
him
with
a
smile
that
i
felt
sure
that
it
was
a
book
of
prayers
but
that
i
would
never
reveal
his
secret
you
have
guessed
what
it
is
he
said
laughing
i
left
him
with
a
courteous
bow
begging
him
to
send
me
his
man
and
a
cup
of
coffee
chocolate
or
broth
it
mattered
not
which
i
went
back
to
my
room
meditating
seriously
on
his
strange
behaviour
and
especially
on
the
wretched
tallow
candle
which
was
given
me
while
he
had
a
wax
taper
my
first
idea
was
to
leave
the
house
immediately
for
though
i
had
only
fifty
ducats
in
my
possession
my
spirit
was
as
high
as
when
i
was
a
rich
man
but
on
second
thoughts
i
determined
not
to
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
affronting
him
in
such
a
signal
manner
the
tallow
candle
was
the
most
grievous
wrong
so
i
resolved
to
ask
the
man
whether
he
had
not
been
told
to
give
me
wax
lights
this
was
important
as
it
might
be
only
a
piece
of
knavery
or
stupidity
on
the
part
of
the
servant
the
man
came
in
an
hour
with
a
cup
of
coffee
sugared
according
to
his
taste
or
that
of
the
cook
this
disgusted
me
so
i
let
it
stay
on
the
table
telling
him
with
a
burst
of
laughter
if
i
had
not
laughed
i
must
have
thrown
the
coffee
in
his
face
that
that
was
not
the
way
to
serve
breakfast
i
then
got
ready
to
have
my
hair
done
i
asked
him
why
he
had
brought
me
a
wretched
tallow
candle
instead
of
two
wax
lights
sir
the
worthy
man
replied
humbly
i
could
only
give
you
what
the
priest
gave
me
i
received
a
wax
taper
for
my
master
and
a
candle
for
you
i
was
sorry
to
have
vexed
the
poor
fellow
and
said
no
more
thinking
the
priest
might
have
taken
a
fancy
to
economise
for
the
count
profit
or
his
own
i
determined
to
question
him
on
the
subject
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
went
out
to
walk
off
my
bad
humour
i
met
the
who
had
been
to
the
locksmith
he
told
me
that
the
man
had
no
locks
but
he
was
going
to
fit
my
door
with
a
padlock
of
which
i
should
have
the
key
provided
i
can
lock
my
door
i
said
i
care
not
how
it
done
i
returned
to
the
house
to
see
the
padlock
fitted
and
while
the
locksmith
was
hammering
away
i
asked
the
priest
why
he
had
given
a
tallow
candle
instead
of
one
or
two
wax
tapers
i
should
never
dare
to
give
you
tapers
sir
without
express
orders
from
the
count
i
should
have
thought
such
a
thing
would
go
without
saying
yes
in
other
houses
but
here
nothing
goes
without
saying
i
have
to
buy
the
tapers
and
he
pays
me
and
every
time
he
has
one
it
is
noted
down
then
you
can
give
me
a
pound
of
wax
lights
if
i
pay
you
for
them
of
course
but
i
think
i
must
tell
the
count
for
you
know
yes
i
know
all
about
it
but
i
do
care
i
gave
him
the
price
of
a
pound
of
wax
lights
and
went
for
a
walk
as
he
told
me
dinner
was
at
one
i
was
somewhat
astonished
on
coming
back
to
the
house
at
twelve
to
be
told
that
the
count
had
been
half
an
hour
at
table
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
all
these
acts
of
rudeness
however
i
moderated
my
passion
once
more
and
came
in
remarking
that
the
abbe
had
told
me
dinner
was
at
one
it
is
usually
replied
the
count
but
i
wanted
to
pay
some
calls
and
take
you
with
me
so
i
decided
on
dining
at
noon
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
he
then
gave
orders
for
all
the
dishes
that
had
been
taken
away
to
be
brought
back
i
made
no
answer
and
sat
down
to
table
and
feigning
good
humour
ate
what
was
on
the
table
refusing
to
touch
those
dishes
which
had
been
taken
away
he
vainly
asked
me
to
try
the
soup
the
beef
the
entrees
i
told
him
that
i
always
punished
myself
thus
when
i
came
in
late
for
a
nobleman
dinner
still
dissembling
my
ill
humour
i
got
into
his
carriage
to
accompany
him
on
his
round
of
visits
he
took
me
to
baron
del
mestre
who
spent
the
whole
of
the
year
in
the
country
with
his
family
keeping
up
a
good
establishment
the
count
spent
the
whole
of
the
day
with
the
baron
putting
off
the
other
visits
to
a
future
time
in
the
evening
we
returned
to
spessa
soon
after
we
arrived
the
priest
returned
the
money
i
had
given
him
for
the
candles
telling
me
that
the
count
had
forgotten
to
inform
him
that
i
was
to
be
treated
as
himself
i
took
this
acknowledgement
for
what
it
was
worth
supper
was
served
and
i
ate
with
the
appetite
of
four
while
the
count
hardly
ate
at
all
the
servant
who
escorted
me
to
my
room
asked
me
at
what
time
i
should
like
breakfast
i
told
him
and
he
was
punctual
and
this
time
the
coffee
was
brought
in
the
and
the
sugar
in
the
sugar
basin
the
valet
did
my
hair
and
the
maid
did
my
room
everything
was
changed
and
i
imagined
that
i
had
given
the
count
a
little
lesson
and
that
i
should
have
no
more
trouble
with
him
here
however
i
was
mistaken
as
the
reader
will
discover
three
or
four
days
later
the
priest
came
to
me
one
morning
to
ask
when
i
would
like
dinner
as
i
was
to
dine
in
my
room
why
so
i
asked
because
the
count
left
yesterday
for
gorice
telling
me
he
did
not
know
when
he
should
come
back
he
ordered
me
to
give
you
your
meals
in
your
room
very
good
i
will
dine
at
one
no
one
could
be
more
in
favour
of
liberty
and
independence
than
myself
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
my
rough
host
should
have
told
me
he
was
going
to
gorice
he
stayed
a
week
and
i
should
have
died
of
weariness
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
daily
visits
to
the
baron
del
mestre
otherwise
there
was
no
company
the
priest
was
an
uneducated
man
and
there
were
no
pretty
country
girls
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
bear
another
four
weeks
of
such
a
doleful
exile
when
the
count
came
back
i
spoke
to
him
plainly
i
came
to
spessa
i
said
to
keep
you
company
and
to
amuse
myself
but
i
see
that
i
am
in
the
way
so
i
hope
you
will
take
me
back
to
gorice
and
leave
me
there
you
must
know
that
i
like
society
as
much
as
you
do
and
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
die
of
solitary
weariness
in
your
house
he
assured
me
that
it
should
not
happen
again
that
he
had
gone
to
gorice
to
meet
an
actress
who
had
come
there
purposely
to
see
him
and
that
he
had
also
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
sign
a
contract
of
marriage
with
a
venetian
lady
these
excuses
and
the
apparently
polite
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
induced
me
to
prolong
my
stay
with
the
extraordinary
count
he
drew
the
whole
of
his
income
from
vineyards
which
produced
an
excellent
white
wine
and
a
revenue
of
a
thousand
sequins
a
year
however
as
the
count
did
his
best
to
spend
double
that
amount
he
was
rapidly
ruining
himself
he
had
a
fixed
impression
that
all
the
tenants
robbed
him
so
whenever
he
found
a
bunch
of
grapes
in
a
cottage
he
proceeded
to
beat
the
occupants
unless
they
could
prove
that
the
grapes
did
not
come
from
his
vineyards
the
peasants
might
kneel
down
and
beg
pardon
but
they
were
thrashed
all
the
same
i
had
been
an
unwilling
witness
of
several
of
these
arbitrary
and
cruel
actions
when
one
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
count
soundly
beaten
by
two
peasants
he
had
struck
the
first
blow
himself
but
when
he
found
that
he
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
he
prudently
took
to
his
heels
he
was
much
offended
with
me
for
remaining
a
mere
spectator
of
the
fray
but
i
told
him
very
coolly
that
being
the
aggressor
he
was
in
the
wrong
and
in
the
second
place
i
was
not
going
to
expose
myself
to
be
beaten
to
a
jelly
by
two
lusty
peasants
in
another
man
quarrel
these
arguments
did
not
satisfy
him
and
in
his
rage
he
dared
to
tell
me
that
i
was
a
scurvy
coward
not
to
know
that
it
was
my
duty
to
defend
a
friend
to
the
death
in
spite
of
these
offensive
remarks
i
merely
replied
with
a
glance
of
contempt
which
he
doubtless
understood
before
long
the
whole
village
had
heard
what
had
happened
and
the
joy
was
universal
for
the
count
had
the
singular
privilege
of
being
feared
by
all
and
loved
by
none
the
two
rebellious
peasants
had
taken
to
their
heels
but
when
it
became
known
that
his
lordship
had
announced
his
resolution
to
carry
pistols
with
him
in
all
future
visits
everybody
was
alarmed
and
two
spokesmen
were
sent
to
the
count
informing
him
that
all
his
tenants
would
quit
the
estate
in
a
week
time
unless
he
gave
them
a
promise
to
leave
them
in
peace
in
their
humble
abodes
the
rude
eloquence
of
the
two
peasants
struck
me
as
sublime
but
the
count
pronounced
them
to
be
impertinent
and
ridiculous
we
have
as
good
a
right
to
taste
the
vines
which
we
have
watered
with
the
sweat
of
our
brow
said
they
as
your
cook
has
to
taste
the
dishes
before
they
are
served
on
your
table
the
threat
of
deserting
just
at
the
vintage
season
frightened
the
count
and
he
had
to
give
in
and
the
embassy
went
its
way
in
high
glee
at
its
success
next
sunday
we
went
to
the
chapel
to
hear
mass
and
when
we
came
in
the
priest
was
at
the
altar
finishing
the
credo
the
count
looked
furious
and
after
mass
he
took
me
with
him
to
the
sacristy
and
begun
to
abuse
and
beat
the
poor
priest
in
spite
of
the
surplice
which
he
was
still
wearing
it
was
really
a
shocking
sight
the
priest
spat
in
his
face
and
cried
help
that
being
the
only
revenge
in
his
power
several
persons
ran
in
so
we
left
the
sacristy
i
was
scandalised
and
i
told
the
count
that
the
priest
would
be
certain
to
go
to
udine
and
that
it
might
turn
out
a
very
awkward
business
try
to
prevent
his
doing
so
i
added
even
by
violence
but
in
the
first
place
endeavour
to
pacify
him
no
doubt
the
count
was
afraid
for
he
called
out
to
his
servants
and
ordered
them
to
fetch
the
priest
whether
he
could
come
or
no
his
order
was
executed
and
the
priest
was
led
in
foaming
with
rage
cursing
the
count
calling
him
excommunicated
wretch
whose
very
breath
was
poisonous
swearing
that
never
another
mass
should
be
sung
in
the
chapel
that
had
been
polluted
with
sacrilege
and
finally
promising
that
the
archbishop
should
avenge
him
the
count
let
him
say
on
and
then
forced
him
into
a
chair
and
the
unworthy
ecclesiastic
not
only
ate
but
got
drunk
thus
peace
was
concluded
and
the
abbe
forgot
all
his
wrongs
a
few
days
later
two
capuchins
came
to
visit
him
at
noon
they
did
not
go
and
as
he
did
not
care
to
dismiss
them
dinner
was
served
without
any
place
being
laid
for
the
friars
thereupon
the
bolder
of
the
two
informed
the
count
that
he
had
had
no
dinner
without
replying
the
count
had
him
accommodated
with
a
plateful
of
rice
the
capuchin
refused
it
saying
that
he
was
worthy
to
sit
not
only
at
his
table
but
at
a
monarch
the
count
who
happened
to
be
in
a
good
humour
replied
that
they
called
themselves
unworthy
brethren
and
that
they
were
consequently
not
worthy
of
any
of
this
world
good
things
the
capuchin
made
but
a
poor
answer
and
as
i
thought
the
count
to
be
in
the
right
i
proceeded
to
back
him
up
telling
the
friar
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
at
having
committed
the
sin
of
pride
so
strictly
condemned
by
the
rules
of
his
order
the
capuchin
answered
me
with
a
torrent
of
abuse
so
the
count
ordered
a
pair
of
scissors
to
be
brought
that
the
beards
of
the
filthy
rogues
might
be
cut
off
at
this
awful
threat
the
two
friars
made
their
escape
and
we
laughed
heartily
over
the
incident
if
all
the
count
eccentricities
had
been
of
this
comparatively
harmless
and
amusing
nature
i
should
not
have
minded
but
such
was
far
from
being
the
case
instead
of
chyle
his
organs
must
have
distilled
some
virulent
poison
he
was
always
at
his
worst
in
his
after
dinner
hours
his
appetite
was
furious
he
ate
more
like
a
tiger
than
a
man
one
day
we
happened
to
be
eating
woodcock
and
i
could
not
help
praising
the
dish
in
the
style
of
the
true
gourmand
he
immediately
took
up
his
bird
tore
it
limb
from
limb
and
gravely
bade
me
not
to
praise
the
dishes
i
liked
as
it
irritated
him
i
felt
an
inclination
to
laugh
and
also
an
inclination
to
throw
the
bottle
at
his
head
which
i
should
probably
have
indulged
in
had
i
been
twenty
years
younger
however
i
did
neither
feeling
that
i
should
either
leave
him
or
accommodate
myself
to
his
humours
three
months
later
madame
costa
the
actress
whom
he
had
gone
to
see
at
gorice
told
me
that
she
would
never
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
such
a
creature
existing
if
she
had
not
known
count
torriano
though
he
is
a
vigorous
lover
she
continued
it
is
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
with
him
to
obtain
the
crisis
and
the
wretched
woman
in
his
arms
is
in
imminent
danger
of
being
strangled
to
death
if
she
can
not
conceal
her
amorous
ecstacy
he
can
not
bear
to
see
another
pleasure
i
pity
his
wife
most
heartily
i
will
now
relate
the
incident
which
put
an
end
to
my
relations
with
this
venomous
creature
amidst
the
idleness
and
weariness
of
spessa
i
happened
to
meet
a
very
pretty
and
very
agreeable
young
widow
i
made
her
some
small
presents
and
finally
persuaded
her
to
pass
the
night
in
my
room
she
came
at
midnight
to
avoid
observation
and
left
at
by
a
small
door
which
opened
on
to
the
road
we
had
amused
ourselves
in
this
pleasant
manner
for
about
a
week
when
one
morning
my
sweetheart
awoke
me
that
i
might
close
the
door
after
her
as
usual
i
had
scarcely
done
so
when
i
heard
cries
for
help
i
quickly
opened
it
again
and
i
saw
the
scoundrelly
torriano
holding
the
widow
with
one
hand
while
he
beat
her
furiously
with
a
stick
he
held
in
the
other
i
rushed
upon
him
and
we
fell
together
while
the
poor
woman
made
her
escape
i
had
only
my
on
and
here
i
was
at
a
disadvantage
for
civilized
man
is
a
poor
creature
without
his
clothes
however
i
held
the
stick
with
one
hand
while
i
squeezed
his
throat
with
the
other
on
his
side
he
clung
to
the
stick
with
his
right
hand
and
pulled
my
hair
with
the
left
at
last
his
tongue
started
out
and
he
had
to
let
go
i
was
on
my
feet
again
in
an
instant
and
seizing
the
stick
i
aimed
a
sturdy
blow
at
his
head
which
luckily
for
him
he
partially
parried
i
did
not
strike
again
so
he
got
up
ran
a
little
way
and
began
to
pick
up
stones
however
i
did
not
wait
to
be
pelted
but
shut
myself
in
my
room
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
only
sorry
that
i
had
not
choked
the
villain
outright
as
soon
as
i
had
rested
i
looked
to
my
pistols
dressed
myself
and
went
out
with
the
intention
of
looking
for
some
kind
of
conveyance
to
take
me
back
to
gorice
without
knowing
it
i
took
a
road
that
led
me
to
the
cottage
of
the
poor
widow
whom
i
found
looking
calm
though
sad
she
told
me
she
had
received
most
of
the
blows
on
her
shoulders
and
was
not
much
hurt
what
vexed
her
was
that
the
affair
would
become
public
as
two
peasants
had
seen
the
count
beating
her
and
our
subsequent
combat
i
gave
her
two
sequins
begging
her
to
come
and
see
me
at
gorice
and
to
tell
me
where
i
could
find
a
conveyance
her
sister
offered
to
shew
me
the
way
to
a
farm
where
i
could
get
what
i
wanted
on
the
way
she
told
me
that
torriano
had
been
her
sister
enemy
before
the
death
of
her
husband
because
she
rejected
all
his
proposals
i
found
a
good
conveyance
at
the
farm
and
the
man
promised
to
drive
me
in
to
gorice
by
i
gave
him
as
an
earnest
and
went
away
telling
him
to
come
for
me
i
returned
to
the
count
and
had
scarcely
finished
getting
ready
when
the
conveyance
drove
up
i
was
about
to
put
my
luggage
in
it
when
a
servant
came
from
the
count
asking
me
to
give
him
a
moment
conversation
i
wrote
a
note
in
french
saying
that
after
what
had
passed
we
ought
not
to
meet
again
under
his
roof
a
minute
later
he
came
into
my
room
and
shut
the
door
saying
as
you
wo
speak
to
me
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
what
have
you
got
to
say
if
you
leave
my
house
in
this
fashion
you
will
dishonour
me
and
i
will
not
allow
it
excuse
me
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
how
you
are
going
to
prevent
me
from
leaving
your
house
i
will
not
allow
you
to
go
by
yourself
we
must
go
together
certainly
i
understand
you
perfectly
get
your
sword
or
your
pistols
and
we
will
start
directly
there
is
room
for
two
in
the
carriage
that
wo
do
you
must
dine
with
me
and
then
we
can
go
in
my
carriage
you
make
a
mistake
i
should
be
a
fool
if
i
dined
with
you
when
our
miserable
dispute
is
all
over
the
village
it
will
have
reached
gorice
if
you
wo
dine
with
me
i
will
dine
with
you
and
people
may
say
what
they
like
we
will
go
after
dinner
so
send
away
that
conveyance
i
had
to
give
in
to
him
the
wretched
count
stayed
with
me
till
noon
endeavouring
to
persuade
me
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
beat
a
in
the
road
and
that
i
was
altogether
in
the
wrong
i
laughed
and
said
i
wondered
how
he
derived
his
right
to
beat
a
free
woman
anywhere
and
that
his
pretence
that
i
being
her
lover
had
no
right
to
protect
her
was
a
monstrous
one
she
had
just
left
my
arms
i
continued
was
i
not
therefore
her
natural
protector
only
a
coward
or
a
monster
like
yourself
would
have
remained
indifferent
though
indeed
i
believe
that
even
you
would
have
done
the
same
a
few
minutes
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
he
said
that
neither
of
us
would
profit
by
the
adventure
as
he
meant
the
duel
to
be
to
the
death
i
do
agree
with
you
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
replied
and
as
to
the
duel
you
can
fight
or
not
fight
as
you
please
for
my
part
i
have
had
satisfaction
if
we
come
to
a
duel
i
hope
to
leave
you
in
the
land
of
the
living
though
i
shall
do
my
best
to
lay
you
up
for
a
considerable
time
so
that
you
may
have
leisure
to
reflect
on
your
folly
on
the
other
hand
if
fortune
favours
you
you
may
act
as
you
please
we
will
go
into
the
wood
by
ourselves
and
my
coachman
shall
have
orders
to
drive
you
wherever
you
like
if
you
come
out
of
the
wood
by
yourself
very
good
indeed
and
which
would
you
prefer
swords
or
pistols
swords
i
think
then
i
promise
to
unload
my
pistols
as
soon
as
we
get
into
the
carriage
i
was
astonished
to
find
the
usually
brutal
count
become
quite
polite
at
the
prospect
of
a
duel
i
felt
perfectly
confident
myself
as
i
was
sure
of
flooring
him
at
the
first
stroke
by
a
peculiar
lunge
then
i
could
escape
through
venetian
territory
where
i
was
not
known
but
i
had
good
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
duel
would
end
in
smoke
as
so
many
other
duels
when
one
of
the
parties
is
a
coward
and
a
coward
i
believed
the
count
to
be
we
started
after
an
excellent
dinner
the
count
having
no
luggage
and
mine
being
strapped
behind
the
carriage
i
took
care
to
draw
the
charges
of
my
pistols
before
the
count
i
had
heard
him
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
towards
gorice
but
every
moment
i
expected
to
hear
him
order
the
man
to
drive
up
this
or
that
turning
that
we
might
settle
our
differences
i
asked
no
questions
feeling
that
the
initiative
lay
with
him
but
we
drove
on
till
we
were
at
the
gates
of
gorice
and
i
burst
out
laughing
when
i
heard
the
count
order
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
posting
inn
as
soon
as
we
got
there
he
said
you
were
in
the
right
we
must
remain
friends
promise
me
not
to
tell
anyone
of
what
has
happened
i
gave
him
the
promise
we
shook
hands
and
everything
was
over
the
next
day
i
took
up
my
abode
in
one
of
the
quietest
streets
to
finish
my
second
volume
on
the
polish
troubles
but
i
still
managed
to
enjoy
myself
during
my
stay
at
gorice
at
last
i
resolved
on
returning
to
trieste
where
i
had
more
chances
of
serving
and
pleasing
the
state
inquisitors
i
stayed
at
gorice
till
the
end
of
the
year
and
passed
an
extremely
pleasant
six
weeks
my
adventure
at
spessa
had
become
public
property
at
first
everybody
addressed
me
on
the
subject
but
as
i
laughed
and
treated
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
it
would
soon
be
forgotten
torriano
took
care
to
be
most
polite
whenever
we
met
but
i
had
stamped
him
as
a
dangerous
character
and
whenever
he
asked
me
to
dinner
or
supper
i
had
other
engagements
during
the
carnival
he
married
the
young
lady
of
whom
he
had
spoken
to
me
and
as
long
as
he
lived
her
life
was
misery
fortunately
he
died
a
madman
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
after
whilst
i
was
at
gorice
count
charles
coronini
contributed
greatly
to
my
enjoyment
he
died
four
years
later
and
a
month
before
his
death
he
sent
me
his
will
in
ostosyllabic
italian
verses
a
specimen
of
philosophic
mirth
which
i
still
preserve
it
is
full
of
jest
and
wit
though
i
believe
if
he
had
guessed
the
near
approach
of
death
he
would
not
have
been
so
cheerful
for
the
prospect
of
imminent
destruction
can
only
enliven
the
heart
of
a
maniac
during
my
stay
at
gorice
a
certain
richard
lorrain
came
there
he
was
a
bachelor
of
forty
who
had
done
good
financial
service
under
the
viennese
government
and
had
now
retired
with
a
comfortable
pension
he
was
a
fine
man
and
his
agreeable
manners
and
excellent
education
procured
him
admission
into
the
best
company
in
the
town
i
met
him
at
the
house
of
count
torres
and
soon
after
he
was
married
to
the
young
countess
in
october
the
new
council
of
ten
and
the
new
inquisitors
took
office
and
my
protectors
wrote
to
me
that
if
they
could
not
obtain
my
pardon
in
the
course
of
the
next
twelve
months
they
would
be
inclined
to
despair
the
first
of
the
inquisitors
was
sagredo
and
intimate
friend
of
the
procurator
morosini
the
second
grimani
the
friend
of
my
good
dandolo
and
zaguri
wrote
to
me
that
he
would
answer
for
the
third
who
according
to
law
was
one
of
the
six
councillors
who
assist
the
council
of
ten
it
may
not
be
generally
known
that
the
council
of
ten
is
really
a
council
of
seventeen
as
the
doge
has
always
a
right
to
be
present
i
returned
to
trieste
determined
to
do
my
best
for
the
tribunal
for
i
longed
to
return
to
venice
after
nineteen
years
wanderings
i
was
then
and
i
expected
no
more
of
fortune
gifts
for
the
deity
despises
those
of
ripe
age
i
thought
however
that
i
might
live
comfortably
and
independently
at
venice
i
had
talents
and
experience
i
hoped
to
make
use
of
them
and
i
thought
the
inquisitors
would
feel
bound
to
give
me
some
sufficient
employment
i
was
writing
the
history
of
the
polish
troubles
the
first
volume
was
printed
the
second
was
in
preparation
and
i
thought
of
concluding
the
work
in
seven
volumes
afterwards
i
had
a
translation
of
the
iliad
in
view
and
other
literary
projects
would
no
doubt
present
themselves
in
fine
i
thought
myself
sure
of
living
in
venice
where
many
persons
who
would
be
beggars
elsewhere
continue
to
live
at
their
ease
i
left
gorice
on
the
last
day
of
december
and
on
january
i
took
up
my
abode
at
trieste
i
could
not
have
received
a
warmer
welcome
baron
pittoni
the
venetian
consul
all
the
town
councillors
and
the
members
of
the
club
seemed
delighted
to
see
me
again
my
carnival
was
a
pleasant
one
and
in
the
beginning
of
lent
i
published
the
second
volume
of
my
work
on
poland
the
chief
object
of
interest
to
me
at
trieste
was
an
actress
in
a
company
that
was
playing
there
she
was
no
other
than
the
daughter
of
the
count
rinaldi
and
my
readers
may
remember
her
under
the
name
of
irene
i
had
loved
her
at
milan
and
neglected
her
at
genoa
on
account
of
her
father
misdeeds
and
at
avignon
i
had
rescued
her
at
request
eleven
years
had
passed
by
since
i
had
heard
of
her
i
was
astonished
to
see
her
and
i
think
more
sorry
than
glad
for
she
was
still
beautiful
and
i
might
fall
in
love
again
and
being
no
longer
in
a
position
to
give
her
assistance
the
issue
might
be
unfortunate
for
me
however
i
called
on
her
the
next
day
and
was
greeted
with
a
shriek
of
delight
she
told
me
she
had
seen
me
at
the
theatre
and
felt
sure
i
would
come
and
see
her
she
introduced
me
to
her
husband
who
played
parts
like
scapin
and
to
her
daughter
who
had
a
talent
for
dancing
she
gave
me
an
abridged
account
of
her
life
since
we
had
met
in
the
year
i
had
seen
her
at
avignon
she
had
gone
to
turin
with
her
father
at
turin
she
fell
in
love
with
her
present
husband
and
left
her
parents
to
join
her
lot
to
his
since
that
she
said
i
have
heard
of
my
father
death
but
i
do
not
know
what
has
become
of
my
mother
after
some
further
conversation
she
told
me
she
was
a
faithful
wife
though
she
did
not
push
fidelity
so
far
as
to
drive
a
rich
lover
to
despair
i
have
no
lovers
here
she
added
but
i
give
little
suppers
to
a
few
friends
i
do
mind
the
expense
as
i
win
some
money
at
faro
she
was
the
banker
and
she
begged
me
to
join
the
party
now
and
then
i
will
come
after
the
play
i
replied
but
you
must
not
expect
any
high
play
of
me
i
kept
the
appointment
and
supped
with
a
number
of
silly
young
tradesmen
who
were
all
in
love
with
her
after
supper
she
held
a
bank
and
i
was
greatly
astonished
when
i
saw
her
cheating
with
great
dexterity
it
made
me
want
to
laugh
however
i
lost
my
florins
with
a
good
grace
and
left
however
i
did
not
mean
to
let
irene
think
she
was
duping
me
and
i
went
to
see
her
next
morning
at
rehearsal
and
complimented
her
on
her
dealing
she
pretended
not
to
understand
what
i
meant
and
on
my
explaining
myself
she
had
the
impudence
to
tell
me
that
i
was
mistaken
in
my
anger
i
turned
my
back
on
her
saying
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
some
day
at
this
she
began
to
laugh
and
said
well
well
i
confess
and
if
you
tell
me
how
much
you
lost
you
shall
have
it
back
and
if
you
like
you
shall
be
a
partner
in
the
game
no
thank
you
irene
i
will
not
be
present
at
any
more
of
your
suppers
but
i
warn
you
to
be
cautious
games
of
chance
are
strictly
forbidden
i
know
that
but
all
the
young
men
have
promised
strict
secrecy
come
and
breakfast
with
me
whenever
you
like
a
few
days
later
she
came
bringing
her
daughter
with
her
the
girl
was
pretty
and
allowed
me
to
caress
her
one
day
baron
pittoni
met
them
at
my
lodgings
and
as
he
liked
young
girls
as
well
as
i
he
begged
irene
to
make
her
daughter
include
him
in
her
list
of
favoured
lovers
i
advised
her
not
to
reject
the
offer
and
the
baron
fell
in
love
with
her
which
was
a
piece
of
luck
for
irene
as
she
was
accused
of
playing
unlawful
games
and
would
have
been
severely
treated
if
the
baron
had
not
given
her
warning
when
the
police
pounced
on
her
they
found
no
gaming
and
no
gamesters
and
nothing
could
be
done
irene
left
trieste
at
the
beginning
of
lent
with
the
company
to
which
she
belonged
three
years
later
i
saw
her
again
at
padua
her
daughter
had
become
a
charming
girl
and
our
acquaintance
was
renewed
in
the
tenderest
manner
thus
abruptly
end
the
memoirs
of
giacome
casanova
chevalier
de
seingalt
knight
of
the
golden
spur
prothonotary
apostolic
and
scoundrel
cosmopolitic
