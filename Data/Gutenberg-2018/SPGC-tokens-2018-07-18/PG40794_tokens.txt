the

i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
the

are
written
from
the

introduction
the
key
to
understanding
the
doctrine
of
the
essays
which
are
herewith
reprinted
lies
in
the
passages
regarding
the
temporal
development
of
experience
setting
out
from
a
conviction
more
current
at
the
time
when
the
essays
were
written
than
it
now
is
that
knowledge
implies
judgment
and
hence
thinking
the
essays
try
to
show
that
such
terms
as
thinking
reflection
judgment
denote
inquiries
or
the
results
of
inquiry
and
that
inquiry
occupies
an
intermediate
and
mediating
place
in
the
development
of
an
experience
if
this
be
granted
it
follows
at
once
that
a
philosophical
discussion
of
the
distinctions
and
relations
which
figure
most
largely
in
logical
theories
depends
upon
a
proper
placing
of
them
in
their
temporal
context
and
that
in
default
of
such
placing
we
are
prone
to
transfer
the
traits
of
the
of
one
phase
to
that
of
another
with
a
confusing
outcome
i
an
intermediary
stage
for
knowledge
that
is
for
knowledge
comprising
reflection
and
having
a
distinctively
intellectual
quality
implies
a
prior
stage
of
a
different
kind
a
kind
variously
characterized
in
the
essays
as
social
affectional
technological
aesthetic
etc
it
may
most
easily
be
described
from
a
negative
point
of
view
it
is
a
type
of
experience
which
can
not
be
called
a
knowledge
experience
without
doing
violence
to
the
term
knowledge
and
to
experience
it
may
contain
knowledge
resulting
from
prior
inquiries
it
may
include
thinking
within
itself
but
not
so
that
they
dominate
the
situation
and
give
it
its
peculiar
flavor
positively
anyone
recognizes
the
difference
between
an
experience
of
quenching
thirst
where
the
perception
of
water
is
a
mere
incident
and
an
experience
of
water
where
knowledge
of
what
water
is
is
the
controlling
interest
or
between
the
enjoyment
of
social
converse
among
friends
and
a
study
deliberately
made
of
the
character
of
one
of
the
participants
between
aesthetic
appreciation
of
a
picture
and
an
examination
of
it
by
a
connoisseur
to
establish
the
artist
or
by
a
dealer
who
has
a
commercial
interest
in
determining
its
probable
selling
value
the
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
experience
is
evident
to
anyone
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
recall
what
he
does
most
of
the
time
when
not
engaged
in
meditation
or
inquiry
but
since
one
does
not
think
about
knowledge
except
when
he
is
except
that
is
when
the
intellectual
or
cognitional
interest
is
dominant
the
professional
philosopher
is
only
too
prone
to
think
of
all
experiences
as
if
they
were
of
the
type
he
is
specially
engaged
in
and
hence
unconsciously
or
intentionally
to
project
traits
into
experiences
to
which
they
are
alien
unless
he
takes
the
simple
precaution
of
holding
before
his
mind
contrasting
experiences
like
those
just
mentioned
he
generally
forms
a
habit
of
supposing
that
no
qualities
or
things
at
all
are
present
in
experience
except
as
objects
of
some
kind
of
apprehension
or
awareness
overlooking
and
afterward
denying
that
things
and
qualities
are
present
to
most
men
most
of
the
time
as
things
and
qualities
in
situations
of
prizing
and
aversion
of
seeking
and
finding
of
converse
enjoyment
and
suffering
of
production
and
employment
of
manipulation
and
destruction
he
thinks
of
things
as
either
totally
absent
from
experience
or
else
there
as
objects
of
consciousness
or
knowing
this
habit
is
a
tribute
to
the
of
reflection
and
of
the
knowledge
which
accrues
from
it
but
a
discussion
of
knowledge
perverted
at
the
outset
by
such
a
misconception
is
not
likely
to
proceed
prosperously
all
this
is
not
to
deny
that
some
element
of
reflection
or
inference
may
be
required
in
any
situation
to
which
the
term
experience
is
applicable
in
any
way
which
contrasts
with
say
the
experience
of
an
oyster
or
a
growing
bean
vine
men
experience
illness
what
they
experience
is
certainly
something
very
different
from
an
object
of
apprehension
yet
it
is
quite
possible
that
what
makes
an
illness
into
a
experience
is
precisely
the
intellectual
elements
which
intervene
a
certain
taking
of
some
things
as
representative
of
other
things
my
thesis
about
the
primary
character
of
experience
is
not
intended
to
preclude
this
hypothesis
which
appears
to
me
a
highly
plausible
one
but
it
is
indispensable
to
note
that
even
in
such
cases
the
intellectual
element
is
set
in
a
context
which
is
and
which
holds
within
it
in
suspense
a
vast
complex
of
other
qualities
and
things
that
in
the
experience
itself
are
objects
of
esteem
or
aversion
of
decision
of
use
of
suffering
of
endeavor
and
revolt
not
of
knowledge
when
in
a
subsequent
reflective
experience
we
look
back
and
find
these
things
and
qualities
quales
would
be
a
better
word
or
values
if
the
latter
word
were
not
so
open
to
misconstruction
we
are
only
too
prone
to
suppose
that
they
were
then
what
they
are
now
objects
of
a
cognitive
regard
themes
of
an
intellectual
gesture
hence
the
erroneous
conclusion
that
things
are
either
just
out
of
experience
or
else
are
more
or
less
badly
known
objects
in
any
case
the
best
way
to
study
the
character
of
those
cognitional
factors
which
are
merely
incidental
in
so
many
of
our
experiences
is
to
study
them
in
the
type
of
experience
where
they
are
most
prominent
where
they
dominate
where
knowing
in
short
is
the
prime
concern
such
study
will
also
by
a
reflex
reference
throw
into
greater
relief
the
contrasted
characteristic
traits
of
the
types
of
experience
in
such
contrast
the
significant
traits
of
the
latter
are
seen
to
be
internal
organization
the
factors
and
qualities
hang
together
there
is
a
great
variety
of
them
but
they
are
saturated
with
a
pervasive
quality
being
ill
with
the
grippe
is
an
experience
which
includes
an
immense
diversity
of
factors
but
none
the
less
is
the
one
qualitatively
unique
experience
which
it
is
philosophers
in
their
exclusively
intellectual
preoccupation
with
analytic
knowing
are
only
too
much
given
to
overlooking
the
primary
import
of
the
term
thing
namely
an
affair
an
occupation
a
cause
something
which
is
similar
to
having
the
grippe
or
conducting
a
political
campaign
or
getting
rid
of
an
overstock
of
canned
tomatoes
or
going
to
school
or
paying
attention
to
a
young
woman
in
short
just
what
is
meant
in
discourse
by
an
experience
noting
things
only
as
if
they
were
objects
that
is
objects
of
knowledge
continuity
is
rendered
a
mystery
qualitative
pervasive
unity
is
too
often
regarded
as
a
subjective
state
injected
into
an
object
which
does
not
possess
it
as
a
mental
construct
or
else
as
a
trait
of
being
to
be
attained
to
only
by
recourse
to
some
curious
organ
of
knowledge
termed
intuition
in
like
fashion
organization
is
thought
of
as
the
achieved
outcome
of
a
highly
scientific
knowledge
or
as
the
result
of
transcendental
rational
synthesis
or
as
a
fiction
superinduced
by
association
upon
elements
each
of
which
in
its
own
right
is
a
separate
existence
one
advantage
of
an
excursion
by
one
who
philosophizes
upon
knowledge
into
primary
experience
is
that
the
excursion
serves
to
remind
him
that
every
empirical
situation
has
its
own
organization
of
a
direct
character
another
trait
of
every
is
that
it
has
focus
and
context
brilliancy
and
obscurity
conspicuousness
or
apparency
and
concealment
or
reserve
with
a
constant
movement
of
redistribution
movement
about
an
axis
persists
but
what
is
in
focus
constantly
changes
consciousness
in
other
words
is
only
a
very
small
and
shifting
portion
of
experience
the
scope
and
content
of
the
focused
apparency
have
immediate
dynamic
connections
with
portions
of
experience
not
at
the
time
obvious
the
word
which
i
have
just
written
is
momentarily
focal
around
it
there
shade
off
into
vagueness
my
typewriter
the
desk
the
room
the
building
the
campus
the
town
and
so
on
the
experience
and
in
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
even
what
is
shiningly
apparent
are
all
the
physical
features
of
the
environment
extending
out
into
space
no
one
can
say
how
far
and
all
the
habits
and
interests
extending
backward
and
forward
in
time
of
the
organism
which
uses
the
typewriter
and
which
notes
the
written
form
of
the
word
only
as
temporary
focus
in
a
vast
and
changing
scene
i
shall
not
dwell
upon
the
import
of
this
fact
in
its
critical
bearings
upon
theories
of
experience
which
have
been
current
i
shall
only
point
out
that
when
the
word
experience
is
employed
in
the
text
it
means
just
such
an
immense
and
operative
world
of
diverse
and
interacting
elements
it
might
seem
wiser
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
term
experience
is
so
frequently
used
by
philosophers
to
denote
something
very
different
from
such
a
world
to
use
an
acknowledgedly
objective
term
to
talk
about
the
typewriter
for
example
but
experience
in
ordinary
usage
as
distinct
from
its
technical
use
in
psychology
and
philosophy
expressly
denotes
something
which
a
specific
term
like
typewriter
does
designate
namely
the
indefinite
range
of
context
in
which
the
typewriter
is
set
its
spatial
and
temporal
environment
including
the
habitudes
plans
and
activities
of
its
operator
and
if
we
are
asked
why
not
then
use
a
general
objective
term
like
world
or
environment
the
answer
is
that
the
word
experience
suggests
something
indispensable
which
these
terms
omit
namely
an
actual
focusing
of
the
world
at
one
point
in
a
focus
of
immediate
shining
apparency
in
other
words
in
its
ordinary
human
usage
the
term
experience
was
invented
and
employed
previously
because
of
the
necessity
of
having
some
way
to
refer
peremptorily
to
what
is
indicated
in
only
a
roundabout
and
divided
way
by
such
terms
as
organism
and
environment
subject
and
object
persons
and
things
mind
and
nature
and
so
on
ii
had
this
background
of
the
essays
been
more
explicitly
depicted
i
do
not
know
whether
they
would
have
met
with
more
acceptance
but
it
is
likely
that
they
would
not
have
met
with
so
many
misunderstandings
but
the
essays
save
for
slight
incidental
references
took
this
background
for
granted
in
the
allusions
to
the
universe
of
experience
of
our
doings
sufferings
enjoyments
of
the
world
and
of
one
another
it
was
their
purpose
to
point
out
that
reflection
and
hence
knowledge
having
logical
properties
arises
because
of
the
appearance
of
incompatible
factors
within
the
empirical
situation
just
pointed
at
incompatible
not
in
a
mere
structural
or
static
sense
but
in
an
active
and
progressive
sense
then
opposed
responses
are
provoked
which
can
not
be
taken
simultaneously
in
overt
action
and
which
accordingly
can
be
dealt
with
whether
simultaneously
or
successively
only
after
they
have
been
brought
into
a
plan
of
organized
action
by
means
of
analytic
resolution
and
synthetic
imaginative
conspectus
in
short
by
means
of
being
taken
cognizance
of
in
other
words
reflection
appears
as
the
dominant
trait
of
a
situation
when
there
is
something
seriously
the
matter
some
trouble
due
to
active
discordance
dissentiency
conflict
among
the
factors
of
a
prior
experience
when
in
the
phraseology
of
the
essays
a
situation
becomes
tensional
given
such
a
situation
it
is
obvious
that
the
meaning
of
the
situation
as
a
whole
is
uncertain
through
calling
out
two
opposed
modes
of
behavior
it
presents
itself
as
meaning
two
incompatible
things
the
only
way
out
is
through
careful
inspection
of
the
situation
involving
resolution
into
elements
and
a
going
out
beyond
what
is
found
upon
such
inspection
to
be
given
to
something
else
to
get
a
leverage
for
understanding
it
that
is
we
have
to
locate
the
difficulty
and
to
devise
a
method
of
coping
with
it
any
such
way
of
looking
at
thinking
demands
moreover
that
the
difficulty
be
located
the
situation
in
question
very
literally
in
question
knowing
always
has
a
purpose
and
its
solution
must
be
a
function
of
its
conditions
in
connection
with
ones
which
are
brought
to
bear
every
reflective
knowledge
in
other
words
has
a
specific
task
which
is
set
by
a
concrete
and
empirical
situation
so
that
it
can
perform
that
task
only
by
detecting
and
remaining
faithful
to
the
conditions
in
the
situation
in
which
the
difficulty
arises
while
its
purpose
is
a
reorganization
of
its
factors
in
order
to
get
unity
so
far
however
there
is
no
accomplished
knowledge
but
only
knowledge
coming
to
be
learning
in
the
classic
greek
conception
thinking
gets
no
farther
as
than
a
statement
of
elements
constituting
the
difficulty
at
hand
and
a
statement
a
propounding
a
proposition
of
a
method
for
resolving
them
in
fixing
the
framework
of
every
reflective
situation
this
state
of
affairs
also
determines
the
further
step
which
is
needed
if
there
is
to
be
knowledge
knowledge
in
the
eulogistic
sense
as
distinct
from
opinion
dogma
and
guesswork
or
from
what
casually
passes
current
as
knowledge
overt
action
is
demanded
if
the
worth
or
validity
of
the
reflective
considerations
is
to
be
determined
otherwise
we
have
at
most
only
a
hypothesis
that
the
conditions
of
the
difficulty
are
such
and
such
and
that
the
way
to
go
at
them
so
as
to
get
over
or
through
them
is
thus
and
so
this
way
must
be
tried
in
action
it
must
be
applied
physically
in
the
situation
by
finding
out
what
then
happens
we
test
our
intellectual
findings
our
logical
terms
or
projected
metes
and
bounds
if
the
required
reorganization
is
effected
they
are
confirmed
and
reflection
on
that
topic
ceases
if
not
there
is
frustration
and
inquiry
continues
that
all
knowledge
as
issuing
from
reflection
is
experimental
in
the
literal
physical
sense
of
experimental
is
then
a
constituent
proposition
of
this
doctrine
upon
this
view
thinking
or
is
far
from
being
the
armchair
thing
it
is
often
supposed
to
be
the
reason
it
is
not
an
armchair
thing
is
that
it
is
not
an
event
going
on
exclusively
within
the
cortex
or
the
cortex
and
vocal
organs
it
involves
the
explorations
by
which
relevant
data
are
procured
and
the
physical
analyses
by
which
they
are
refined
and
made
precise
it
comprises
the
readings
by
which
information
is
got
hold
of
the
words
which
are
experimented
with
and
the
calculations
by
which
the
significance
of
entertained
conceptions
or
hypotheses
is
elaborated
hands
and
feet
apparatus
and
appliances
of
all
kinds
are
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
changes
in
the
brain
since
these
physical
operations
including
the
cerebral
events
and
equipments
are
a
part
of
thinking
thinking
is
mental
not
because
of
a
peculiar
stuff
which
enters
into
it
or
of
peculiar
activities
which
constitute
it
but
because
of
what
physical
acts
and
appliances
the
distinctive
purpose
for
which
they
are
employed
and
the
distinctive
results
which
they
accomplish
that
reflection
terminates
through
a
definitive
overt
act
in
another
situation
within
which
incompatible
responses
may
again
in
time
be
aroused
and
so
another
problem
in
reflection
be
set
goes
without
saying
certain
things
about
this
situation
however
do
not
at
the
present
time
speak
for
themselves
and
need
to
be
set
forth
let
me
in
the
first
place
call
attention
to
an
ambiguity
in
the
term
knowledge
the
statement
that
all
knowledge
involves
reflection
or
more
concretely
that
it
denotes
an
inference
from
evidence
gives
offense
to
many
it
seems
a
departure
from
fact
as
well
as
a
wilful
limitation
of
the
word
knowledge
i
have
in
this
introduction
endeavored
to
mitigate
the
obnoxiousness
of
the
doctrine
by
referring
to
knowledge
which
is
intellectual
or
logical
in
character
lest
this
expression
be
regarded
as
a
futile
evasion
of
a
real
issue
i
shall
now
be
more
explicit
it
may
well
be
admitted
that
there
is
a
real
sense
in
which
knowledge
as
distinct
from
thinking
or
inquiring
with
a
guess
attached
does
not
come
into
existence
till
thinking
has
terminated
in
the
experimental
act
which
fulfils
the
specifications
set
forth
in
thinking
but
what
is
also
true
is
that
the
object
thus
determined
is
an
object
of
only
because
of
the
thinking
which
has
preceded
it
and
to
which
it
sets
a
happy
term
to
run
against
a
hard
and
painful
stone
is
not
of
itself
i
should
say
an
act
of
knowing
but
if
running
into
a
hard
and
painful
thing
is
an
outcome
predicted
after
inspection
of
data
and
elaboration
of
a
hypothesis
then
the
hardness
and
the
painful
bruise
which
define
the
thing
as
a
stone
also
constitute
it
emphatically
an
object
of
knowledge
in
short
the
object
of
knowledge
in
the
strict
sense
is
its
objective
and
this
objective
is
not
constituted
till
it
is
reached
now
this
conclusion
as
the
word
denotes
is
thinking
brought
to
a
close
done
with
if
the
reader
does
not
find
this
statement
satisfactory
he
may
pending
further
discussion
at
least
recognize
that
the
doctrine
set
forth
has
no
difficulty
in
connecting
knowledge
with
inference
and
at
the
same
time
admitting
that
knowledge
in
the
emphatic
sense
does
not
exist
till
inference
has
ceased
seen
from
this
point
of
view
immediate
knowledge
or
simple
apprehension
or
represents
a
critical
skill
a
certainty
of
response
which
has
accrued
in
consequence
of
reflection
a
like
sureness
of
footing
apart
from
prior
investigations
and
testings
is
found
in
instinct
and
habit
i
do
not
deny
that
these
may
be
better
than
knowing
but
i
see
no
reason
for
complicating
an
already
too
confused
situation
by
giving
them
the
name
knowledge
with
its
usual
intellectual
implications
from
this
point
of
view
the
of
knowledge
is
precisely
that
which
we
do
think
of
or
mentally
refer
to
in
any
way
being
that
which
is
taken
as
matter
of
course
but
it
is
nevertheless
knowledge
in
virtue
of
the
inquiry
which
has
led
up
to
it
definiteness
depth
and
variety
of
meaning
attach
to
the
objects
of
an
experience
just
in
the
degree
in
which
they
have
been
previously
thought
about
even
when
present
in
an
experience
in
which
they
do
not
evoke
inferential
procedures
at
all
such
terms
as
meaning
significance
value
have
a
double
sense
sometimes
they
mean
a
function
the
office
of
one
thing
representing
another
or
pointing
to
it
as
implied
the
operation
in
short
of
serving
as
sign
in
the
word
symbol
this
meaning
is
practically
exhaustive
but
the
terms
also
sometimes
mean
an
inherent
quality
a
quality
intrinsically
characterizing
the
thing
experienced
and
making
it
worth
while
the
word
sense
as
in
the
phrase
sense
of
a
thing
and
is
devoted
to
this
use
as
definitely
as
are
the
words
sign
and
symbol
to
the
other
in
such
a
pair
as
import
and
importance
the
first
tends
to
select
the
reference
to
another
thing
while
the
second
names
an
intrinsic
content
in
reflection
the
extrinsic
reference
is
always
primary
the
height
of
the
mercury
means
rain
the
color
of
the
flame
means
sodium
the
form
of
the
curve
means
factors
distributed
accidentally
in
the
situation
which
follows
upon
reflection
meanings
are
intrinsic
they
have
no
instrumental
or
subservient
office
because
they
have
no
office
at
all
they
are
as
much
qualities
of
the
objects
in
the
situation
as
are
red
and
black
hard
and
soft
square
and
round
and
every
reflective
experience
adds
new
shades
of
such
intrinsic
qualifications
in
other
words
while
reflective
knowing
is
instrumental
to
gaining
control
in
a
troubled
situation
and
thus
has
a
practical
or
utilitarian
force
it
is
also
instrumental
to
the
enrichment
of
the
immediate
significance
of
subsequent
experiences
and
it
may
well
be
that
this
this
gift
of
the
gods
is
incomparably
more
valuable
for
living
a
life
than
is
the
primary
and
intended
result
of
control
essential
as
is
that
control
to
having
a
life
to
live
words
are
treacherous
in
this
field
there
are
no
accepted
criteria
for
assigning
or
measuring
their
meanings
but
if
one
use
the
term
consciousness
to
denote
immediate
values
of
objects
then
it
is
certainly
true
that
consciousness
is
a
lyric
cry
even
in
the
midst
of
business
but
it
is
equally
true
that
if
someone
else
understands
by
consciousness
the
function
of
effective
reflection
then
consciousness
is
a
business
even
in
the
midst
of
writing
or
singing
lyrics
but
the
statement
remains
inadequate
until
we
add
that
knowing
as
a
business
inquiry
and
invention
as
enterprises
as
practical
acts
become
themselves
charged
with
the
meaning
of
what
they
accomplish
as
own
immediate
quality
there
exists
no
disjunction
between
aesthetic
qualities
which
are
final
yet
idle
and
acts
which
are
practical
or
instrumental
the
latter
have
their
own
delights
and
sorrows
iii
speaking
then
from
the
standpoint
of
temporal
order
we
find
reflection
or
thought
occupying
an
intermediate
and
reconstructive
position
it
comes
between
a
temporally
prior
situation
an
organized
interaction
of
factors
of
active
and
appreciative
experience
wherein
some
of
the
factors
have
become
discordant
and
incompatible
and
a
later
situation
which
has
been
constituted
out
of
the
first
situation
by
means
of
acting
on
the
findings
of
reflective
inquiry
this
final
situation
therefore
has
a
richness
of
meaning
as
well
as
a
controlled
character
lacking
to
its
original
by
it
is
fixed
the
logical
validity
or
intellectual
force
of
the
terms
and
relations
distinguished
by
reflection
owing
to
the
continuity
of
experience
the
overlapping
and
recurrence
of
like
problems
these
logical
fixations
become
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
subsequent
inquiries
they
are
its
working
means
in
such
further
uses
they
get
further
tested
defined
and
elaborated
until
the
vast
and
refined
systems
of
the
technical
objects
and
formulae
of
the
sciences
come
into
existence
a
point
to
which
we
shall
return
later
owing
to
circumstances
upon
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
the
position
thus
sketched
was
not
developed
primarily
upon
its
own
independent
account
but
rather
in
the
course
of
a
criticism
of
another
type
of
logic
the
idealistic
logic
found
in
lotze
it
is
obvious
that
the
theory
in
question
has
critical
bearings
according
to
it
reflection
in
its
distinctions
and
processes
can
be
understood
only
when
placed
in
its
intermediate
pivotal
temporal
position
as
a
process
of
control
through
reorganization
of
material
alogical
in
character
it
intimates
that
thinking
would
not
exist
and
hence
knowledge
would
not
be
found
in
a
world
which
presented
no
troubles
or
where
there
are
no
problems
of
evil
and
on
the
other
hand
that
a
reflective
method
is
the
only
sure
way
of
dealing
with
these
troubles
it
intimates
that
while
the
results
of
reflection
because
of
the
continuity
of
experience
may
be
of
wider
scope
than
the
situation
which
calls
out
a
particular
inquiry
and
invention
reflection
itself
is
always
specific
in
origin
and
aim
it
always
has
something
special
to
cope
with
for
troubles
are
concretely
specific
it
intimates
also
that
thinking
and
reflective
knowledge
are
never
an
never
their
own
purpose
nor
justification
but
that
they
pass
naturally
into
a
more
direct
and
vital
type
of
experience
whether
technological
or
appreciative
or
social
this
doctrine
implies
moreover
that
logical
theory
in
its
usual
sense
is
essentially
a
descriptive
study
that
it
is
an
account
of
the
processes
and
tools
which
have
actually
been
found
effective
in
inquiry
comprising
in
the
term
inquiry
both
deliberate
discovery
and
deliberate
invention
since
the
doctrine
was
propounded
in
an
intellectual
environment
where
such
statements
were
not
commonplaces
where
in
fact
a
logic
was
reigning
which
challenged
these
convictions
at
every
point
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
was
put
forth
with
a
controversial
coloring
being
directed
particularly
at
the
dominant
idealistic
logic
the
point
of
contact
and
hence
the
point
of
conflict
between
the
logic
set
forth
and
the
idealistic
logic
are
not
far
to
seek
the
logic
based
on
idealism
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
treated
knowledge
from
the
standpoint
of
an
account
of
thought
of
thought
in
the
sense
of
conception
judgment
and
inferential
reasoning
but
while
it
had
inherited
this
view
from
the
older
rationalism
it
had
also
learned
from
hume
via
kant
that
direct
sense
or
perceptual
material
must
be
taken
into
account
hence
it
had
in
effect
formulated
the
problem
of
logic
as
the
problem
of
the
connection
of
logical
thought
with
and
had
attempted
to
set
forth
a
metaphysics
of
reality
based
upon
various
ascending
stages
of
the
completeness
of
the
rationalization
or
idealization
of
given
brute
fragmentary
sense
material
by
synthetic
activity
of
thought
while
considerations
of
a
much
less
formal
kind
were
chiefly
influential
in
bringing
idealism
to
its
modern
vogue
such
as
the
conciliation
of
a
scientific
with
a
religious
and
moral
point
of
view
and
the
need
of
rationalizing
social
and
historic
institutions
so
as
to
explain
their
cultural
effect
yet
this
logic
constituted
the
of
idealism
its
strictly
intellectual
claim
for
acceptance
the
point
of
contact
and
hence
of
conflict
between
it
and
such
a
doctrine
of
logic
and
reflective
thought
as
is
set
forth
above
is
i
repeat
fairly
obvious
both
fix
upon
thinking
as
the
key
to
the
situation
i
still
believe
what
i
believed
when
i
wrote
the
essays
that
under
the
influence
of
idealism
valuable
analyses
and
formulations
of
the
work
of
reflective
thought
in
its
relation
to
securing
knowledge
of
objects
were
executed
but
and
the
but
is
one
of
exceptional
gravity
the
idealistic
logic
started
from
the
distinction
between
immediate
plural
data
and
unifying
rationalizing
meanings
as
a
distinction
in
experience
and
it
set
up
as
the
goal
of
knowledge
and
hence
as
the
definition
of
true
reality
a
complete
exhaustive
comprehensive
and
eternal
system
in
which
plural
and
immediate
data
are
forever
woven
into
a
fabric
and
pattern
of
meaning
in
short
it
ignored
the
temporally
intermediate
and
instrumental
place
of
reflection
and
because
it
ignored
and
denied
this
place
it
overlooked
its
essential
feature
control
of
the
environment
in
behalf
of
human
progress
and
the
effort
at
control
being
stimulated
by
the
needs
the
defects
the
troubles
which
accrue
when
the
environment
coerces
and
suppresses
man
or
when
man
endeavors
in
ignorance
to
override
the
environment
hence
it
misconstrued
the
criterion
of
the
work
of
intelligence
it
set
up
as
its
criterion
an
absolute
and
reality
at
large
instead
of
using
the
criterion
of
specific
temporal
achievement
of
consequences
through
a
control
supplied
by
reflection
and
with
this
outcome
it
proved
faithless
to
the
cause
which
had
generated
it
and
given
it
its
reason
for
being
the
magnification
of
the
work
of
intelligence
in
our
actual
physical
and
social
world
for
a
theory
which
ends
by
declaring
that
everything
is
really
and
eternally
thoroughly
ideal
and
rational
cuts
the
nerve
of
the
specific
demand
and
work
of
intelligence
from
this
general
statement
let
me
descend
to
the
technical
point
upon
which
turns
the
criticism
of
idealistic
logic
by
the
essays
grant
for
a
moment
as
a
hypothesis
that
thinking
starts
neither
from
an
implicit
force
of
rationality
desiring
to
realize
itself
completely
in
and
through
and
against
the
limitations
which
are
imposed
upon
it
by
the
conditions
of
our
human
experience
as
all
idealisms
have
taught
nor
from
the
fact
that
in
each
human
being
is
a
mind
whose
business
it
is
just
to
know
to
theorize
in
the
aristotelian
sense
but
rather
that
it
starts
from
an
effort
to
get
out
of
some
trouble
actual
or
menacing
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
human
race
has
tried
many
another
way
out
besides
reflective
inquiry
its
favorite
resort
has
been
a
combination
of
magic
and
poetry
the
former
to
get
the
needed
relief
and
control
the
latter
to
import
into
imagination
and
hence
into
emotional
consummation
the
realizations
denied
in
fact
but
as
far
as
reflection
does
emerge
and
gets
a
working
foothold
the
nature
of
its
job
is
set
for
it
on
the
one
hand
it
must
discover
it
must
find
out
it
must
detect
it
must
inventory
what
is
there
all
this
or
else
it
will
never
know
what
the
matter
is
the
human
being
will
not
find
out
what
struck
him
and
hence
will
have
no
idea
of
where
to
seek
for
a
remedy
for
the
needed
control
on
the
other
hand
it
must
invent
it
must
project
it
must
bring
to
bear
upon
the
given
situation
what
is
not
as
it
exists
given
as
a
part
of
it
this
seems
to
be
quite
empirical
and
quite
evident
the
essays
submitted
the
thesis
that
this
simple
dichotomization
of
the
practical
situation
of
power
and
enjoyment
when
menaced
into
what
is
there
whether
as
obstacle
or
as
resource
and
into
suggested
inventions
projections
of
something
else
to
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
ways
of
dealing
with
it
is
the
explanation
of
the
logical
determinations
of
brute
fact
datum
and
meaning
or
ideal
quality
of
in
more
psychological
terminology
and
conception
of
particulars
parts
fragments
and
and
also
of
whatever
there
is
of
intrinsic
significance
in
the
traditional
scheme
of
logic
it
held
less
formally
that
this
view
explained
the
eulogistic
connotations
always
attaching
to
reason
and
to
the
work
of
reason
in
effecting
unity
harmony
comprehension
or
synthesis
and
to
the
traditional
combination
of
a
depreciatory
attitude
toward
brute
facts
with
a
grudging
concession
of
the
necessity
which
thought
is
under
of
accepting
them
and
taking
them
for
its
own
and
checks
more
specifically
it
is
held
that
this
view
supplied
and
i
should
venture
to
say
for
the
first
time
an
explanation
of
the
traditional
theory
of
truth
as
a
correspondence
or
agreement
of
existence
and
mind
or
thought
it
showed
that
the
correspondence
or
agreement
was
like
that
between
an
invention
and
the
conditions
which
the
invention
is
intended
to
meet
thereby
a
lot
of
epistemological
to
logic
were
eliminated
for
the
distinctions
which
epistemology
had
misunderstood
were
located
where
they
belong
in
the
art
of
inquiry
considered
as
a
joint
process
of
ascertainment
and
invention
projection
or
hypothesizing
of
which
more
below
iv
the
essays
were
published
in
at
that
time
as
has
been
noted
idealism
was
in
practical
command
of
the
philosophic
field
in
both
england
and
this
country
the
logics
in
vogue
were
profoundly
influenced
by
kantian
and
thought
empirical
logics
those
conceived
under
the
influence
of
mill
still
existed
but
their
light
was
dimmed
by
the
radiance
of
the
regnant
idealism
moreover
from
the
standpoint
of
the
doctrine
expounded
in
the
essays
the
empirical
logic
committed
the
same
logical
fault
as
did
the
idealistic
in
taking
to
be
primitive
instead
of
being
resolutions
of
the
of
prior
experiences
into
elements
for
the
aim
of
securing
evidence
while
it
had
no
recognition
of
the
specific
service
rendered
by
intelligence
in
the
development
of
new
meanings
and
plans
of
new
actions
this
state
of
things
may
explain
the
controversial
nature
of
the
essays
and
their
selection
in
particular
of
an
idealistic
logic
for
animadversion
since
the
essays
were
written
there
has
been
an
impressive
revival
of
realism
and
also
a
development
of
a
type
of
logical
theory
the
analytic
logic
corresponding
to
the
philosophical
aspirations
of
the
new
realism
this
marked
alteration
of
intellectual
environment
subjects
the
doctrine
of
the
essays
to
a
test
not
contemplated
when
they
were
written
it
is
one
thing
to
develop
a
hypothesis
in
view
of
a
particular
situation
it
is
another
to
test
its
worth
in
view
of
procedures
and
results
having
a
radically
different
motivation
and
direction
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
discuss
the
analytic
logic
in
this
place
a
consideration
of
how
some
of
its
main
tenets
compare
with
the
conclusions
outlined
above
will
however
throw
some
light
upon
the
meaning
and
the
worth
of
the
latter
although
this
was
formulated
with
the
idealistic
and
sensationalistic
logics
in
mind
the
hypothesis
that
knowledge
can
be
rightly
understood
only
in
connection
with
considerations
of
time
and
temporal
position
is
a
general
one
if
it
is
valid
it
should
be
readily
applicable
to
a
critical
placing
of
any
theory
which
ignores
and
denies
such
temporal
considerations
and
while
i
have
learned
much
from
the
realistic
movement
about
the
full
force
of
the
position
sketched
in
the
essays
when
adequately
developed
and
while
later
discussions
have
made
it
clear
that
the
language
employed
in
the
essays
was
sometimes
unnecessarily
though
naturally
infected
by
the
subjectivism
of
the
positions
against
which
it
was
directed
i
find
that
the
analytic
logic
is
also
guilty
of
the
fault
of
temporal
dislocation
in
one
respect
idealistic
logic
takes
cognizance
of
a
temporal
contrast
indeed
it
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
based
upon
it
it
seizes
upon
the
contrast
in
intellectual
force
consistency
and
comprehensiveness
between
the
crude
or
raw
data
with
which
science
sets
out
and
the
defined
ordered
and
systematic
totality
at
which
it
aims
and
which
in
part
it
achieves
this
difference
is
a
genuine
empirical
difference
idealism
noted
that
the
difference
may
properly
be
ascribed
to
the
intervention
of
thinking
that
thought
is
what
makes
the
difference
now
since
the
outcome
of
science
is
of
higher
intellectual
rank
than
its
data
and
since
the
intellectualistic
tradition
in
philosophy
has
always
identified
degrees
of
logical
adequacy
with
degrees
of
reality
the
conclusion
was
naturally
drawn
that
real
world
absolute
reality
was
an
ideal
or
and
that
the
the
the
world
of
actual
and
historic
experience
is
simply
a
phenomenal
world
presenting
a
fragmentary
manifestation
of
that
thought
which
the
process
of
human
thinking
makes
progressively
explicit
and
articulate
this
perception
of
the
intellectual
superiority
of
objects
which
are
constituted
at
the
conclusion
of
thinking
over
those
which
formed
its
data
may
fairly
be
termed
the
empirical
factor
in
the
idealistic
logic
the
essence
of
the
realistic
reaction
on
its
logical
side
is
exceedingly
simple
it
starts
from
those
objects
with
which
science
approved
science
ends
since
they
are
the
objects
which
are
which
are
true
they
are
the
real
objects
that
they
are
also
objects
for
intervening
thinking
is
an
interesting
enough
historical
and
psychological
fact
but
one
quite
irrelevant
to
their
natures
which
are
precisely
what
knowledge
finds
them
to
be
in
the
biography
of
human
beings
it
may
hold
good
that
apprehension
of
objects
is
arrived
at
only
through
certain
wanderings
endeavors
exercises
experiments
possibly
acts
called
sensation
memory
reflection
may
be
needed
by
men
in
reaching
a
grasp
of
the
objects
but
such
things
denote
facts
about
the
history
of
the
knower
not
about
the
nature
of
the
known
object
analysis
will
show
moreover
that
any
intelligible
account
of
this
history
any
verified
statement
of
the
psychology
of
knowing
assumes
objects
which
are
unaffected
by
the
knowing
otherwise
the
pretended
history
is
merely
pretense
and
not
to
be
trusted
the
history
of
the
process
of
knowing
moreover
implies
also
the
terms
and
propositions
truths
of
logic
that
logic
must
therefore
be
assumed
as
a
science
of
objects
real
and
true
quite
apart
from
any
process
of
thinking
them
in
short
the
requirement
is
that
we
shall
think
things
as
they
are
themselves
not
make
them
into
objects
constructed
by
thinking
this
revival
of
realism
coincided
also
with
an
important
movement
in
mathematics
and
logic
the
attempt
to
treat
logical
distinctions
by
mathematical
methods
while
at
the
same
time
mathematical
had
become
so
generalized
that
it
was
a
theory
of
types
and
orders
of
terms
and
propositions
in
short
a
logic
certain
minds
have
always
found
mathematics
the
type
of
knowledge
because
of
its
definiteness
order
and
comprehensiveness
the
wonderful
accomplishments
of
modern
mathematics
including
its
development
into
a
type
of
highly
generalized
logic
was
not
calculated
to
lessen
the
tendency
and
while
prior
philosophers
have
generally
played
their
admiration
of
mathematics
into
the
hands
of
idealism
regarding
mathematical
as
the
embodiment
or
manifestation
of
pure
thought
the
new
philosophy
insisted
that
the
terms
and
types
of
order
constituting
mathematical
and
logical
were
real
in
their
own
right
and
at
most
merely
led
up
to
and
discovered
by
thinking
an
operation
moreover
itself
subjected
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
the
entities
and
relationships
set
forth
by
logic
the
inadequacy
of
this
summary
account
may
be
pardoned
in
view
of
the
fact
that
no
adequate
exposition
is
intended
all
that
is
wanted
is
such
a
statement
of
the
general
relationship
of
idealism
to
realism
as
may
serve
as
the
point
of
departure
for
a
comparison
with
the
instrumentalism
of
the
essays
in
bare
outline
it
is
obvious
that
the
two
latter
agree
in
regarding
thinking
as
instrumental
not
as
constitutive
but
this
agreement
turns
out
to
be
a
formal
matter
in
contrast
with
a
disagreement
concerning
that
thinking
is
instrumental
the
new
realism
finds
that
it
is
instrumental
simply
to
knowledge
of
objects
from
this
it
infers
with
perfect
correctness
and
inevitableness
that
thinking
including
all
the
operations
of
discovery
and
testing
as
they
might
be
set
forth
in
an
inductive
logic
is
a
mere
psychological
preliminary
utterly
irrelevant
to
any
conclusions
regarding
the
nature
of
objects
known
the
thesis
of
the
essays
is
that
thinking
is
instrumental
to
a
control
of
the
environment
a
control
effected
through
acts
which
would
not
be
undertaken
without
the
prior
resolution
of
a
complex
situation
into
assured
elements
and
an
accompanying
projection
of
possibilities
without
that
is
to
say
thinking
such
an
instrumentalism
seems
to
analytic
realism
but
a
variant
of
idealism
for
it
asserts
that
processes
of
reflective
inquiry
play
a
part
in
shaping
the
objects
namely
terms
and
propositions
which
constitute
the
bodies
of
scientific
knowledge
now
it
must
not
only
be
admitted
but
proclaimed
that
the
doctrine
of
the
essays
holds
that
intelligence
is
not
an
otiose
affair
nor
yet
a
mere
preliminary
to
a
apprehension
of
terms
and
propositions
in
so
far
as
it
is
idealistic
to
hold
that
objects
of
knowledge
their
capacity
of
distinctive
objects
of
are
determined
by
intelligence
it
is
idealistic
it
believes
that
faith
in
the
constructive
the
creative
competency
of
intelligence
was
the
redeeming
element
in
historic
idealisms
lest
however
we
be
misled
by
general
terms
the
scope
and
limits
of
this
idealism
must
be
formulated
its
distinguishing
trait
is
that
it
defines
thought
or
intelligence
by
function
by
work
done
by
consequences
effected
it
does
not
start
with
a
power
an
entity
or
substance
or
activity
which
is
thought
or
reason
and
which
as
such
constitutes
the
world
thought
intelligence
is
to
it
just
a
name
for
the
events
and
acts
which
make
up
the
processes
of
analytic
inspection
and
projected
invention
and
testing
which
have
been
described
these
events
these
acts
are
wholly
natural
they
are
realistic
they
comprise
the
sticks
and
stones
the
bread
and
butter
the
trees
and
horses
the
eyes
and
ears
the
lovers
and
haters
the
sighs
and
delights
of
ordinary
experience
thinking
is
what
some
of
the
actual
existences
are
in
no
sense
constituted
by
thinking
on
the
contrary
the
problems
of
thought
are
set
by
difficulties
and
its
resources
are
furnished
by
efficacies
its
acts
are
doings
adapted
to
a
distinctive
end
the
reorganization
the
modification
effected
by
thinking
is
by
this
hypothesis
a
physical
one
thinking
ends
in
experiment
and
experiment
is
an
alteration
of
a
physically
antecedent
situation
in
those
details
or
respects
which
called
for
thought
in
order
to
do
away
with
some
evil
to
suffer
a
disease
and
to
try
to
do
something
for
it
is
a
primal
experience
to
look
into
the
disease
to
try
and
find
out
just
what
makes
it
a
disease
to
invent
or
hypothecate
remedies
is
a
reflective
experience
to
try
the
suggested
remedy
and
see
whether
the
disease
is
helped
is
the
act
which
transforms
the
data
and
the
intended
remedy
into
and
this
transformation
into
knowledge
objects
is
also
effected
by
changing
physical
things
by
physical
means
speaking
from
this
point
of
view
the
decisive
consideration
as
between
instrumentalism
and
analytic
realism
is
whether
the
operation
of
experimentation
is
or
is
not
necessary
to
knowledge
the
instrumental
theory
holds
that
it
is
analytic
realism
holds
that
even
though
it
were
essential
in
knowledge
or
in
learning
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
knowledge
itself
and
hence
nothing
to
do
with
the
known
object
that
it
makes
a
change
only
in
the
knower
not
in
what
is
to
be
known
and
for
precisely
the
same
reason
instrumentalism
holds
that
an
object
as
a
is
never
a
whole
that
it
is
surrounded
with
and
inclosed
by
things
which
are
quite
other
than
objects
of
knowledge
so
that
knowledge
can
not
be
understood
in
isolation
or
when
taken
as
mere
beholding
or
grasping
of
objects
that
is
to
say
while
it
is
making
the
sick
man
better
or
worse
or
leaving
him
just
the
same
which
determines
the
of
certain
findings
of
fact
and
certain
conceptions
as
to
mode
of
treatment
so
that
by
the
treatment
they
become
definitely
yet
improvement
or
deterioration
of
the
patient
is
other
than
an
object
of
cognitive
apprehension
its
phase
is
a
selection
in
reference
to
prior
reflections
so
the
laboratory
experiment
of
a
chemist
which
brings
to
a
head
a
long
reflective
inquiry
and
settles
the
intellectual
status
of
its
findings
and
theorizings
thereby
making
them
into
cognitive
concerns
or
terms
and
propositions
is
itself
much
more
than
a
knowledge
of
terms
and
propositions
and
only
by
virtue
of
this
surplusage
is
it
even
contemplative
knowledge
he
knows
say
tin
when
he
has
made
tin
into
an
outcome
of
his
investigating
procedures
but
tin
is
much
more
than
a
term
of
knowledge
putting
the
matter
in
a
slightly
different
way
logical
as
distinct
from
na√Øve
realism
confuses
means
of
knowledge
with
objects
of
knowledge
the
means
are
twofold
they
are
the
data
of
a
particular
inquiry
so
far
as
they
are
significant
because
of
prior
experimental
inquiries
and
they
are
the
meanings
which
have
been
settled
in
consequence
of
prior
intellectual
undertakings
on
the
one
hand
particular
things
or
qualities
as
signs
on
the
other
general
meanings
as
possibilities
of
what
is
signified
by
given
data
our
physician
has
in
advance
a
technique
for
telling
that
certain
particular
traits
if
he
finds
them
are
symptoms
signs
and
he
has
a
store
of
diseases
and
remedies
in
mind
which
may
possibly
be
meant
in
any
given
case
from
prior
reflective
experiments
he
has
learned
to
look
for
temperature
for
rate
of
heartbeats
for
sore
spots
in
certain
places
to
take
specimens
of
blood
sputum
of
membrane
and
subject
them
to
cultures
microscopic
examination
etc
he
has
acquired
certain
habits
in
other
words
in
virtue
of
which
certain
physical
qualities
and
events
are
more
than
physical
in
virtue
of
which
they
are
signs
or
indications
of
something
else
on
the
other
hand
this
something
else
is
a
somewhat
not
physically
present
at
the
time
it
is
a
series
of
events
still
to
happen
it
is
suggested
by
what
is
given
but
is
no
part
of
the
given
now
in
the
degree
in
which
the
physician
comes
to
the
examination
of
what
is
there
with
a
large
and
comprehensive
stock
of
such
possibilities
or
meanings
in
mind
he
will
be
intellectually
resourceful
in
dealing
with
a
particular
case
they
the
concepts
or
universals
of
the
situation
are
together
with
the
of
the
data
the
of
knowing
the
case
in
hand
they
are
the
agencies
of
transforming
it
through
the
actions
which
they
call
for
into
an
object
an
object
of
knowledge
a
truth
to
be
stated
in
propositions
but
since
the
professional
as
distinct
from
the
human
knower
is
particularly
concerned
with
the
elaboration
of
these
tools
the
professional
knower
of
which
the
class
philosopher
presents
of
course
one
case
ungenerously
drops
from
sight
the
situation
in
its
integrity
and
treats
these
instrumentalities
of
knowledge
as
objects
of
knowledge
each
of
these
aspects
signs
and
things
signified
is
sufficiently
important
to
deserve
a
section
on
its
own
account
v
the
position
taken
in
the
essays
is
frankly
realistic
in
acknowledging
that
certain
brute
existences
detected
or
laid
bare
by
thinking
but
in
no
way
constituted
out
of
thought
or
any
mental
process
set
every
problem
for
reflection
and
hence
serve
to
test
its
otherwise
merely
speculative
results
it
is
simply
insisted
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
brute
existences
are
equivalent
neither
to
the
objective
content
of
the
situations
technological
or
artistic
or
social
in
which
thinking
originates
nor
to
the
things
to
be
known
to
the
objects
of
knowledge
let
us
take
the
sequence
of
mineral
rock
in
place
pig
iron
and
the
manufactured
article
comparing
the
raw
material
in
its
undisturbed
place
in
nature
to
the
original
of
experience
compare
the
manufactured
article
to
the
objective
and
object
of
knowledge
and
the
brute
datum
to
the
metal
undergoing
extraction
from
raw
ore
for
the
sake
of
being
wrought
into
a
useful
thing
and
we
should
add
that
just
as
the
manufacturer
always
has
a
lot
of
already
extracted
ore
on
hand
for
use
in
machine
processes
as
it
is
wanted
so
every
person
of
any
maturity
especially
if
he
lives
in
an
environment
affected
by
previous
scientific
work
has
a
lot
of
extracted
data
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
of
tools
of
extraction
for
use
in
inference
as
they
are
required
we
go
about
with
a
disposition
to
identify
certain
shapes
as
tables
certain
sounds
as
words
of
the
french
language
certain
cries
as
evidences
of
distress
certain
massed
colors
as
woods
in
the
distance
certain
empty
spaces
as
buttonholes
and
so
on
indefinitely
the
examples
are
trivial
enough
but
if
more
complicated
matters
were
taken
it
would
be
seen
that
a
large
part
of
the
technique
of
science
all
of
science
which
is
specifically
inductive
in
character
consists
of
methods
of
finding
out
just
what
qualities
are
unambiguous
economical
and
dependable
signs
of
those
other
things
which
can
not
be
got
at
as
directly
as
can
the
elements
and
if
we
started
from
the
more
obscure
and
complex
difficulties
of
identification
and
diagnosis
with
which
the
sciences
of
physiology
botany
astronomy
chemistry
deal
we
should
be
forced
to
recognize
that
the
identifications
of
everyday
life
our
perceptions
of
chairs
tables
trees
friends
differ
only
in
presenting
questions
much
easier
of
solution
in
every
case
it
is
a
matter
of
fixing
some
given
physical
existence
as
a
sign
of
some
other
existences
not
given
in
the
same
way
as
is
that
which
serves
as
a
sign
these
words
of
mill
might
well
be
made
the
motto
of
every
logic
to
draw
inferences
has
been
said
to
be
the
great
business
of
life
everyone
has
daily
hourly
and
momentary
need
of
ascertaining
facts
which
he
has
not
directly
observed
it
is
the
only
occupation
in
which
the
mind
never
ceases
to
be
engaged
such
being
the
case
the
indispensable
condition
of
doing
the
business
well
is
the
careful
determination
of
the
of
specific
things
in
experience
and
this
condition
can
never
be
fulfilled
as
long
as
a
thing
is
presented
to
us
so
to
say
in
bulk
the
complex
organizations
which
are
the
of
our
direct
activities
and
enjoyments
are
grossly
unfit
to
serve
as
intellectual
indications
or
evidence
their
testimony
is
almost
worthless
they
speak
so
many
languages
in
their
complexity
they
point
equally
in
all
directions
in
their
unity
they
run
in
a
groove
and
point
to
whatever
is
most
customary
to
break
up
the
complexity
to
resolve
it
into
a
number
of
independent
variables
each
as
irreducible
as
it
is
possible
to
make
it
is
the
only
way
of
getting
secure
pointers
as
to
what
is
indicated
by
the
occurrence
of
the
situation
in
question
the
objects
of
ordinary
life
stones
plants
cats
rocks
moon
are
neither
the
data
of
science
nor
the
objects
at
which
science
arrives
we
are
here
face
to
face
with
a
crucial
point
in
analytic
realism
realism
argues
that
we
have
no
alternative
except
either
to
regard
analysis
as
falsifying
√†
la
bergson
and
thus
commit
ourselves
to
distrust
of
science
as
an
organ
of
knowledge
or
else
to
admit
that
something
eulogistically
termed
reality
especially
as
being
as
subject
to
space
and
time
determinations
is
but
a
complex
made
up
of
fixed
mutually
independent
simples
that
reality
is
truly
conceived
only
under
the
caption
of
whole
and
parts
where
the
parts
are
independent
of
each
other
and
consequently
of
the
whole
for
instrumentalism
however
the
alleged
dilemma
simply
does
not
exist
the
results
of
abstraction
and
analysis
are
perfectly
real
but
they
are
real
like
everything
else
they
are
real
that
is
to
say
in
some
in
the
situation
where
they
originate
and
operate
the
remark
is
perhaps
more
cryptic
than
enlightening
its
intent
is
that
reflection
is
an
actual
occurrence
as
much
so
as
a
thunderstorm
or
a
growing
plant
and
as
an
actual
existence
it
is
characterized
by
specific
existential
traits
uniquely
belonging
to
it
the
entities
of
simple
data
as
such
it
is
in
control
of
the
evidential
function
that
irreducible
and
independent
simples
or
elements
exist
they
certainly
are
found
there
as
we
have
seen
they
objects
broken
up
into
expeditious
and
unambiguous
signs
of
conclusions
to
be
drawn
conclusions
about
other
things
with
which
they
the
elements
are
continuous
in
some
respects
although
discrete
with
respect
to
their
sensory
conditions
but
there
is
no
more
reason
for
supposing
that
they
exist
in
the
same
manner
than
there
is
for
supposing
that
centaurs
coexist
along
with
domestic
horses
and
cows
because
they
coexist
with
the
material
of
or
rites
or
for
supposing
that
pigs
of
iron
as
pigs
in
the
mine
there
is
no
falsifying
in
analysis
the
analysis
is
carried
on
within
a
situation
which
controls
it
the
fallacy
and
falsifying
is
on
the
part
of
the
philosopher
who
ignores
the
contextual
situation
and
who
transfers
the
properties
which
things
have
as
dependable
evidential
signs
over
to
things
in
other
modes
of
behavior
it
is
no
reply
to
this
position
to
say
that
the
elements
or
simples
were
there
prior
to
inquiry
and
to
analysis
and
abstraction
of
course
their
was
in
some
sense
there
and
being
there
was
found
discovered
or
detected
hit
upon
i
am
not
questioning
this
statement
rather
i
have
been
asserting
it
but
i
am
asking
for
patience
and
industry
to
consider
the
matter
somewhat
further
i
would
ask
the
man
who
takes
the
terms
of
logical
analysis
physical
resolution
for
the
sake
of
getting
assured
evidential
indications
of
objects
as
yet
unknown
to
be
things
which
coexist
with
the
things
of
a
situation
to
inquire
what
his
independent
given
ultimates
were
there
prior
to
analysis
i
would
point
out
that
in
any
case
they
did
signs
consequently
whatever
traits
or
properties
they
possess
as
signs
must
at
least
be
referred
exclusively
to
the
reflective
situation
and
they
must
possess
some
distinguishing
traits
signs
otherwise
they
would
be
indistinguishable
from
anything
else
which
happens
to
be
thought
of
and
could
not
be
employed
as
evidence
could
not
be
in
short
what
they
are
if
the
reader
will
seriously
ask
just
what
traits
data
do
possess
as
signs
or
evidence
i
shall
be
quite
content
to
leave
the
issue
to
the
results
of
his
own
inquiries
any
inquiry
as
to
the
data
antecedently
exist
will
i
am
confident
show
that
they
do
not
exist
in
the
same
purity
the
same
external
exclusiveness
and
internal
homogeneity
which
they
present
within
the
situation
of
inference
any
more
than
the
iron
which
in
the
rocks
in
the
mountains
was
just
the
same
as
the
fluxed
and
extracted
ore
hence
they
did
not
exist
in
the
same
isolated
simplicity
i
have
not
the
slightest
interest
in
exaggerating
the
scope
of
this
difference
the
important
matter
is
not
its
extent
or
range
but
what
such
a
change
however
small
indicates
namely
that
the
material
is
entering
into
a
new
environment
and
has
been
subjected
to
the
changes
which
will
make
it
useful
and
effective
in
that
environment
it
is
trivial
to
suppose
that
the
sole
or
even
the
primary
difficulty
which
an
analytic
realism
has
to
face
is
the
occurrence
of
error
and
illusions
of
secondary
qualities
etc
the
difficulty
resides
in
the
contrast
of
the
world
of
a
na√Øve
say
aristotelian
realism
with
that
of
a
highly
intellectualized
and
analytic
disintegration
of
the
everyday
world
of
things
if
realism
is
generous
enough
to
have
a
place
its
world
as
a
having
social
and
temporal
qualities
as
well
as
spatial
ones
for
data
in
process
of
construction
of
objects
the
outlook
is
radically
different
from
the
case
where
in
the
interests
of
a
theory
a
realism
insists
that
analytic
determinations
are
the
sole
real
things
if
it
be
not
only
conceded
but
asserted
that
the
generating
the
data
of
scientific
procedure
antedates
the
procedure
it
may
be
asked
what
is
the
point
of
insisting
so
much
upon
the
fact
that
data
exist
only
within
the
procedure
is
not
the
statement
either
a
trivial
tautology
or
else
an
attempt
to
inject
a
certain
idealistic
dependence
upon
thought
into
even
brute
facts
the
question
is
a
fair
one
and
the
clew
to
the
reply
may
be
found
in
the
consideration
that
it
was
not
historically
an
easy
matter
to
reduce
the
iron
of
the
rocks
to
the
iron
which
could
freely
and
effectively
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
articles
it
involved
hitting
upon
a
highly
complicated
art
but
an
art
nevertheless
which
anyone
with
the
necessary
capital
and
education
can
command
today
as
a
matter
of
course
giving
no
thought
to
the
fact
that
one
is
using
an
art
constructed
originally
with
vast
pains
similarly
it
is
by
art
by
a
carefully
determined
technique
that
the
things
of
our
primary
experience
are
resolved
into
unquestioned
and
irreducible
data
lacking
in
inner
complexity
and
hence
unambiguous
there
is
no
call
for
the
scientific
man
in
the
pursuit
of
his
calling
to
take
account
of
this
fact
any
more
than
the
manufacturer
need
reckon
with
the
arts
which
are
required
to
deliver
him
his
material
but
a
logician
a
philosopher
is
supposed
to
take
a
somewhat
broader
survey
and
for
his
purposes
the
fact
which
the
scientific
inquirer
can
leave
out
of
account
because
it
is
no
part
of
his
business
may
be
the
important
fact
for
the
logician
it
would
seem
is
concerned
not
with
the
significance
of
these
or
those
data
but
with
the
significance
of
there
being
such
things
as
data
with
their
traits
of
irreducibleness
bruteness
simplicity
etc
now
as
the
special
scientific
inquirer
answers
the
question
as
to
the
significance
of
his
special
brute
facts
by
discovering
other
facts
with
which
they
are
connected
so
it
would
seem
that
the
logician
can
find
out
the
significance
of
the
existence
of
data
the
fact
which
concerns
him
only
by
finding
out
the
other
facts
with
which
coexist
their
significance
being
their
factual
continuities
and
the
first
step
in
the
search
for
these
other
facts
which
supply
significance
is
the
recognition
that
they
have
been
extracted
for
a
purpose
for
the
purpose
of
guiding
inference
it
is
this
purposeful
situation
of
inquiry
which
supplies
the
facts
which
give
the
existence
of
brute
data
their
significance
and
unless
there
is
such
a
discovery
or
some
better
one
the
logician
will
inevitably
fail
in
conceiving
the
import
of
the
existence
of
brute
data
and
this
misconception
is
i
repeat
just
the
defect
from
which
an
analytic
presentative
realism
suffers
to
perceive
that
the
brute
data
laid
bare
in
scientific
proceedings
are
always
traits
of
an
extensive
situation
and
of
that
situation
as
one
which
needs
control
and
which
is
to
undergo
modification
in
some
respects
is
to
be
protected
from
any
temptation
to
turn
logical
specification
into
metaphysical
atomism
the
need
for
the
protection
is
sufficiently
great
to
justify
spending
some
energy
in
pointing
out
that
the
brute
objective
facts
of
scientific
discovery
are
discovered
facts
discovered
by
physical
manipulations
which
detach
them
from
their
ordinary
setting
we
have
stated
that
strictly
speaking
data
as
the
immediate
considerations
from
which
controlled
inference
proceeds
are
not
objects
but
means
instrumentalities
of
knowledge
things
by
which
we
know
rather
than
things
known
it
is
by
the
color
stain
that
we
know
a
cellular
structure
it
is
by
marks
on
a
page
that
we
know
what
some
man
believes
it
is
by
the
height
of
the
barometer
that
we
know
the
probability
of
rain
it
is
by
the
scratches
on
the
rock
that
we
know
that
ice
was
once
there
it
is
by
qualities
detected
in
chemical
and
microscopic
examination
that
we
know
that
a
thing
is
human
blood
and
not
paint
just
what
the
realist
asserts
about
mental
states
of
sensations
images
and
ideas
namely
that
they
are
not
the
of
knowledge
but
its
agencies
holds
of
the
chairs
and
tables
to
which
he
appeals
in
support
of
his
doctrine
of
an
immediate
cognitive
presentation
apart
from
any
problem
and
any
reflection
and
there
is
very
solid
ground
for
instituting
the
comparison
the
sensations
images
of
the
idealist
are
nothing
but
the
chairs
tables
of
the
realist
in
their
ultimate
irreducible
qualities
the
problem
in
which
the
realist
appeals
to
the
immediate
apprehension
of
the
table
is
the
epistemological
problem
and
he
appeals
to
the
table
not
as
an
object
of
knowledge
as
he
thinks
he
does
but
as
evidence
as
a
means
of
knowing
his
conclusion
his
real
of
knowledge
he
has
only
to
examine
his
own
evidence
to
see
that
it
is
evidence
and
hence
a
term
in
a
reflective
inquiry
while
the
nature
of
knowledge
is
the
of
his
knowledge
again
the
question
may
be
asked
since
instrumentalism
admits
that
the
table
is
really
there
why
make
such
a
fuss
about
whether
it
is
there
as
a
means
or
as
an
object
of
knowledge
is
not
the
distinction
mere
unless
it
is
a
way
of
smuggling
in
a
dependence
upon
thought
the
reply
will
i
hope
clinch
the
significance
of
the
distinction
whether
or
no
it
makes
it
acceptable
respect
for
knowledge
and
its
object
is
the
ground
for
insisting
upon
the
distinction
the
object
of
knowledge
is
so
to
speak
a
more
dignified
a
more
complete
sufficient
and
thing
than
any
datum
can
be
to
transfer
the
traits
of
the
object
as
known
to
the
datum
of
reaching
it
is
a
material
not
a
merely
verbal
affair
it
is
precisely
this
shift
which
leads
the
presentative
realist
to
substitute
for
irreducibility
and
unambiguity
of
logical
function
use
in
inference
physical
and
metaphysical
isolation
and
elementariness
it
is
this
shift
which
generates
the
need
of
reconciling
the
deliverances
of
science
with
the
structure
and
qualities
of
the
world
in
which
we
directly
live
since
it
sets
up
a
rivalry
between
the
claims
of
the
data
of
objects
and
of
scientific
objects
the
results
of
adequate
inquiry
above
all
it
commits
us
to
a
view
that
change
is
in
some
sense
unreal
since
ultimate
and
primary
entities
being
simple
do
not
permit
of
change
no
whatever
is
to
be
said
about
the
validity
of
the
distinction
contended
for
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
insignificant
a
theory
which
commits
us
to
the
conception
of
a
world
of
eleatic
fixities
as
primary
and
which
regards
alteration
and
organization
as
secondary
has
such
profound
consequences
for
thought
and
conduct
that
a
detection
of
its
motivating
fallacy
makes
a
substantial
difference
no
more
fundamental
question
can
be
raised
than
the
range
and
force
of
the
applicability
to
nature
life
and
society
of
the
conception
and
if
we
confuse
our
premises
by
taking
the
existential
instrumentalities
of
knowledge
for
its
real
objects
all
distinctions
and
relations
in
nature
life
and
society
are
thereby
requisitioned
to
be
really
only
cases
of
the
nature
of
things
vi
the
instrumental
theory
acknowledges
the
objectivity
of
as
well
as
of
data
they
are
referred
to
and
employed
in
reflective
inquiry
with
the
confidence
attached
to
the
hard
facts
of
sense
pragmatic
as
distinct
from
sensational
empiricism
may
claim
to
have
antedated
in
criticism
of
resolution
of
meanings
into
states
or
acts
of
consciousness
as
previously
noted
meanings
are
indispensable
instrumentalities
of
reflection
strictly
coincident
with
and
correlative
to
what
is
analytically
detected
to
be
given
or
irremovably
there
data
in
their
fragmentary
character
pose
a
problem
they
also
define
it
they
suggest
possible
meanings
whether
they
them
as
well
as
suggest
them
is
a
question
to
be
resolved
but
the
meanings
suggested
are
genuinely
and
existentially
suggested
and
the
problem
described
by
the
data
can
not
be
solved
without
their
acknowledgment
and
use
that
this
instrumental
necessity
has
led
to
a
metaphysical
hypostatizing
of
meanings
into
essences
or
subsistences
having
some
sort
of
mysterious
being
apart
from
qualitative
things
and
changes
is
a
source
of
regret
it
is
hardly
an
occasion
for
surprise
to
be
sure
of
our
footing
let
us
return
to
empirical
ground
it
is
as
certain
an
empirical
fact
that
one
thing
suggests
another
as
that
fire
alters
the
thing
burned
the
suggesting
thing
has
to
be
there
or
given
something
has
to
be
there
to
do
the
suggesting
the
suggested
thing
is
obviously
not
there
in
the
same
way
as
that
which
suggests
if
it
were
it
would
not
have
to
be
suggested
a
suggestion
tends
in
the
natural
man
to
excite
action
to
operate
as
a
stimulus
i
may
respond
more
readily
and
energetically
to
a
suggested
fire
than
to
the
thing
from
which
the
suggestion
sprang
that
is
the
thing
by
itself
may
leave
me
cold
the
thing
as
suggesting
something
else
may
move
me
vigorously
the
response
if
effected
has
all
the
force
of
a
belief
or
conviction
it
is
we
believed
on
intellectual
grounds
that
the
thing
a
fire
but
it
is
discovered
that
not
all
suggestions
are
indications
or
signifiers
the
whale
suggested
by
the
cloud
form
does
not
stand
on
the
same
level
as
the
fire
suggested
by
smoke
and
the
suggested
fire
does
not
always
turn
out
fire
in
fact
we
are
led
to
examine
the
original
point
of
departure
and
we
find
out
that
it
was
not
really
smoke
in
a
world
where
and
cream
suggestions
acted
upon
have
respectively
different
consequences
and
where
a
thing
suggests
one
as
readily
as
the
other
or
masquerades
as
cream
the
importance
of
examination
of
the
thing
exercising
the
suggestive
force
prior
to
acting
upon
what
it
suggests
is
obvious
hence
the
act
of
response
naturally
stimulated
is
turned
into
channels
of
inspection
and
experimental
physical
analysis
we
move
our
body
to
get
a
better
hold
on
it
and
we
pick
it
to
pieces
to
see
what
it
is
this
is
the
operation
which
we
have
been
discussing
in
the
last
section
but
experience
also
testifies
that
the
thing
suggested
is
worth
attention
on
its
own
account
perhaps
we
can
not
get
very
readily
at
the
thing
which
suggesting
flame
suggests
fire
it
may
be
that
reflection
upon
the
meaning
or

fire

fire
here
there
or
anywhere
the
essence
fire
means
thus
and
so
this
thing
really
means
fire
it
will
have
certain
traits
certain
attributes
are
they
there
there
are
flames
on
the
stage
as
part
of
the

do
they
really
indicate
fire
fire
would
mean
danger
but
it
is
not
possible
that
such
a
risk
would
be
taken
with
an
audience
other
meanings
risk
audience
danger
being
brought
in
it
must
be
something
else
well
it
is
probably
colored
in
strips
rapidly
blown
about
this
meaning
leads
us
to
closer
inspection
it
directs
our
observations
to
hunt
for
corroborations
or
negations
if
conditions
permitted
it
would
lead
us
to
walk
up
and
get
at
the
thing
in
close
quarters
in
short
devotion
to
a
suggestion
prior
to
accepting
it
as
stimulus
leads
first
to
other
suggestions
which
may
be
more
applicable
and
secondly
it
affords
the
standpoint
and
the
procedure
of
a
physical
experimentation
to
detect
those
elements
which
are
the
more
reliable
signs
indicators
evidence
thus
treated
are
precisely
what
constitute
meanings
subsistences
etc
without
such
development
and
handling
of
what
is
suggested
the
process
of
analyzing
the
situation
to
get
at
its
hard
facts
and
especially
to
get
at
just
those
which
have
a
right
to
determine
inference
is
haphazard
ineffectively
done
in
the
actual
stress
of
any
such
needed
determination
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
have
a
large
stock
of
possible
meanings
to
draw
on
and
to
have
them
ordered
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
develop
each
promptly
and
accurately
and
move
quickly
from
one
to
another
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
then
that
we
not
only
conserve
such
suggestions
as
have
been
previously
converted
successfully
into
meanings
but
also
that
we
or
some
men
at
least
turn
professional
inquirers
and
thinkers
that
meanings
are
elaborated
and
ordered
in
related
systems
quite
apart
from
any
immediately
urgent
situation
or
that
a
realm
of
essences
is
built
up
apart
from
that
of
existences
that
suggestion
occurs
is
doubtless
a
mystery
but
so
is
it
a
mystery
that
hydrogen
and
oxygen
make
water
it
is
one
of
the
hard
brute
facts
that
we
have
to
take
account
of
we
can
investigate
the
conditions
under
which
the
happening
takes
place
we
can
trace
the
consequences
which
flow
from
the
happening
by
these
means
we
can
so
control
the
happening
that
it
will
take
place
in
a
more
secure
and
fruitful
manner
but
all
this
depends
upon
the
hearty
acceptance
of
the
happening
as
fact
suggestion
does
not
of
itself
yield
meanings
it
yields
only
suggested
things
but
the
moment
we
take
a
suggested
thing
and
develop
it
in
connection
with
other
meanings
and
employ
it
as
a
guide
of
investigation
a
method
of
inquiry
that
moment
we
have
a
meaning
on
our
hands
possessing
all
the
verifiable
features
which
have
been
imported
at
any
time
to
ideas
forms
species
essences
subsistences
this
empirical
identification
of
meaning
by
means
of
the
specific
fact
of
suggestion
cuts
deep
if
occam
razor
still
cuts
a
suggestion
lies
between
adequate
stimulation
and
logical
indication
a
cry
of
fire
may
start
us
running
without
reflection
we
may
have
learned
as
children
are
taught
in
school
to
react
without
questioning
there
is
overt
stimulation
but
no
suggesting
but
if
the
response
is
held
off
or
postponed
it
may
persist
as
suggestion
the
cry
suggests
fire
and
suggests
the
advisability
of
flight
we
may
in
a
sense
we
must
call
suggestion
mental
but
it
is
important
to
note
what
is
meant
by
this
term
fire
running
getting
burned
are
not
mental
they
are
physical
but
in
their
status
of
being
suggested
they
may
be
called
mental
when
we
recognize
this
distinctive
status
this
means
no
more
than
that
they
are
implicated
in
a
specific
way
in
a
reflective
situation
in
virtue
of
which
they
are
susceptible
of
certain
modes
of
treatment
their
status
as
suggested
by
certain
features
of
the
actual
situation
and
possibly
meant
or
indicated
as
well
as
suggested
may
be
definitely
fixed
then
we
get
meanings
logical
terms
determinations
words
are
of
course
the
agencies
of
fixation
chiefly
employed
though
any
kind
of
physical
existence
a
gesture
a
muscular
contraction
in
the
finger
or
leg
or
chest
under
ready
command
may
be
used
what
is
essential
is
that
there
be
a
specific
physical
existence
at
hand
which
may
be
used
to
concrete
and
hold
on
to
the
suggestion
so
that
the
latter
may
be
handled
on
its
own
account
until
thus
detached
and
refixed
there
are
things
suggested
but
hardly
suggestion
things
meant
but
hardly
a
meaning
things
ideated
but
hardly
an
idea
and
the
suggested
thing
until
detached
is
still
too
literal
too
tied
up
with
other
things
to
be
further
developed
or
to
be
successfully
used
as
a
method
of
experimentation
in
new
directions
so
as
to
bring
to
light
new
traits
as
data
are
signs
which
other
existences
so
meanings
are
signs
which
other
meanings
i
am
doubtful
for
example
whether
is
a
man
or
not
that
is
i
am
doubtful
as
to
some
given
traits
when
they
are
taken
as
signs
or
evidences
but
i
am
inclined
to
the
hypothesis
of
a
man
having
such
a
tentative
or
conceptual
object
in
mind
i
am
enabled
to
explore
economically
and
effectively
instead
of
at
random
what
is
present
i
can
elaborate
the
implications
of
the
term
man
to
develop
its
implications
is
all
one
with
telling
its
meaning
in
connection
with
other
meanings
being
a
man
means
for
example
speaking
when
spoken
to
another
meaning
which
need
have
been
no
part
of
man
as
originally
suggested
this
meaning
of
answering
questions
will
then
suggest
a
procedure
which
the
term
man
in
its
first
meaning
did
not
possess
it
is
an
implication
or
implied
meaning
which
puts
me
in
a
new
and
possibly
more
fruitful
relation
to
the
thing
the
process
of
developing
implications
is
usually
termed
discourse
or
ratiocination
now
be
it
noted
replying
to
questions
is
no
part
of
the
of
man
it
would
not
be
now
an
implication
of
plato
or
of
the
russian
czar
for
me
in
other
words
there
is
something
in
the
actual
situation
which
suggests
as
well
as
and
it
is
the
interaction
between
these
two
suggestions
which
is
fruitful
there
is
consequently
no
mystery
about
the
fruitfulness
of
deduction
though
this
fruitfulness
has
been
urged
as
though
it
offered
an
insuperable
objection
to
instrumentalism
on
the
contrary
instrumentalism
is
the
only
theory
to
which
deduction
is
not
a
mystery
if
a
variety
of
wheels
and
cams
and
rods
which
have
been
invented
with
reference
to
doing
a
given
task
are
put
together
one
expects
from
the
assembled
parts
a
result
which
could
not
have
been
got
from
any
one
of
them
separately
or
from
all
of
them
together
in
a
heap
because
they
are
independent
and
unlike
structures
working
on
one
another
something
new
happens
the
same
is
true
of
terms
in
relation
to
one
another
when
these
are
brought
to
bear
upon
one
another
something
new
something
quite
unexpected
happens
quite
as
when
one
tries
an
acid
with
which
he
is
not
familiar
upon
a
rock
with
which
he
is
unfamiliar
that
is
unfamiliar
in
such
a
conjunction
in
spite
of
intimate
acquaintance
elsewhere
a
definition
may
fix
a
certain
modicum
of
meaning
in
the
abstract
as
we
say
it
is
a
specification
of
a
minimum
which
gives
the
point
of
departure
in
every
interaction
of
a
term
with
other
terms
but
nothing
follows
from
the
definition
by
itself
or
in
isolation
it
is
explicit
boringly
so
and
has
no
implications
but
bring
it
in
connection
with
another
term
with
which
it
has
not
previously
interacted
and
it
may
behave
in
the
most
delightful
or
in
the
most
disgustingly
disappointing
way
the
necessity
for
independent
terms
is
made
obvious
in
the
modern
theory
of
axioms
it
escapes
attention
in
much
of
the
contemporary
logic
of
transitive
and
symmetrical
and
relations
because
the
terms
are
so
loaded
that
there
are
no
propositions
at
all
but
only
discriminations
of
orders
of
terms
the
terms
which
figure
in
the
discussions
in
other
words
are
correlatives
brother
parent
up
to
the
right
of
like
greater
after
such
terms
are
not
logical
terms
they
are
of
such
terms
as
they
express
positions
in
a
situation
they
are
not
relations
they
lack
implications
being
explicit
but
a
man
who
is
a
brother
and
also
a
rival
in
love
and
a
poorer
man
than
his
rival
brother
expresses
an
interaction
of
different
terms
from
which
something
might
happen
terms
with
implications
terms
constituting
a
proposition
which
a
correlative
term
never
does
till
brought
into
conjunction
with
a
term
of
which
it
is
not
a
relative
to
have
called
a
thing
up
or
brother
is
to
have
already
solved
its
import
in
some
situation
it
is
dead
till
set
to
work
in
some
situation
experience
shows
moreover
that
certain
qualities
of
things
are
much
more
fruitful
and
much
more
controllable
than
others
when
taken
as
meanings
to
be
used
in
drawing
conclusions
the
term
must
be
of
a
nature
to
develop
a
method
of
behavior
by
which
to
test
whether
it
is
the
meaning
of
the
situation
since
it
is
desirable
to
have
a
stock
of
meanings
on
hand
which
are
so
connected
that
we
can
move
readily
from
one
to
another
in
any
direction
the
stock
is
effective
in
just
the
degree
in
which
it
has
been
worked
into
a
system
a
comprehensive
and
orderly
arrangement
hence
while
all
meanings
are
derived
from
things
which
antedate
suggestion
or
thinking
or
consciousness
not
all
qualities
are
equally
fitted
to
be
meanings
of
a
wide
efficiency
and
it
is
a
work
of
art
to
select
the
proper
qualities
for
doing
the
work
this
corresponds
to
the
working
over
of
raw
material
into
an
effective
tool
a
spade
or
a
watchspring
is
made
out
of
antecedent
material
but
does
not
as
a
tool
and
the
more
delicate
and
complicated
the
work
which
it
has
to
do
the
more
art
intervenes
these
summary
remarks
will
have
to
pass
muster
as
indicating
what
a
more
extensive
treatment
of
a
mathematical
system
of
terms
would
show
man
began
by
working
such
qualities
as
hate
and
love
and
fear
and
beauty
into
the
meanings
by
which
to
interpret
and
control
the
perplexities
of
life
when
they
demonstrated
their
inefficacy
he
had
recourse
to
such
qualities
as
heavy
and
light
wet
and
dry
making
them
into
natural
essences
or
explanatory
and
regulatory
meanings
that
greek
mediaeval
science
did
not
get
very
far
on
these
lines
is
a
commonplace
scientific
progress
and
practical
control
as
systematic
and
deliberate
matters
date
from
the
century
of
galileo
when
qualities
which
lend
themselves
to
mathematical
treatment
were
seized
upon
the
most
promising
of
these
ideal
systems
at
first
were
of
course
the
richer
ones
the
sentimental
ones
the
baldest
and
least
promising
ones
were
the
mathematical
ones
but
the
history
of
the
latter
application
is
a
history
of
steadily
advancing
successes
while
that
of
the
sentimentally
richer
ones
is
one
of
relative
sterility
and
failure
there
is
no
problem
of
why
and
how
the
plow
fits
or
applies
to
the
garden
or
the
watchspring
to
they
were
made
for
those
respective
purposes
the
question
is
how
well
they
do
their
work
and
how
they
can
be
reshaped
to
do
it
better
yet
they
were
made
out
of
physical
material
men
used
ready
limbs
or
roots
of
trees
with
which
to
plow
before
they
used
metal
we
do
not
measure
the
worth
or
reality
of
the
tool
by
its
closeness
to
its
natural
prototype
but
by
its
efficiency
in
doing
its
work
which
connotes
a
great
deal
of
intervening
art
the
theory
proposed
for
mathematical
distinctions
and
relations
is
precisely
analogous
they
are
not
the
creations
of
mind
except
in
the
sense
in
which
a
telephone
is
a
creation
of
mind
they
fit
nature
because
they
are
derived
from
natural
conditions
things
naturally
bulge
so
to
speak
and
naturally
alter
to
seize
upon
these
qualities
to
develop
them
into
keys
for
discovering
the
meanings
of
brute
isolated
events
and
to
accomplish
this
effectively
to
develop
and
order
them
till
they
become
economical
tools
and
tools
upon
tools
for
making
an
unknown
and
uncertain
situation
into
a
known
and
certain
one
is
the
recorded
triumph
of
human
intelligence
the
terms
and
propositions
of
mathematics
are
not
fictions
they
are
not
called
into
being
by
that
particular
act
of
mind
in
which
they
are
used
no
more
is
a
reaper
a
figment
nor
is
it
called
momentarily
into
being
by
the
man
who
wants
to
harvest
his
grain
but
both
alike
are
works
of
art
constructed
for
a
purpose
in
doing
the
things
which
have
to
be
done
we
may
say
of
terms
what
santayana
so
happily
said
of
expression
expression
is
a
misleading
term
which
suggests
that
something
previously
known
is
imitated
or
rendered
whereas
the
expression
is
itself
an
original
fact
the
values
of
which
are
then
referred
to
the
thing
expressed
much
as
the
honors
of
a
chinese
mandarin
are
attributed
retroactively
to
his
parents
the
natural
history
of
imputation
of
virtue
should
prove
to
the
philosopher
a
profitable
theme
even
in
its
most
superstitious
forms
perhaps
more
in
them
than
elsewhere
it
testifies
to
the
sense
of
a
service
to
be
performed
and
to
a
demand
for
application
the
superstition
lies
in
making
the
application
to
antecedents
and
to
ancestors
where
it
is
but
a
shroud
instead
of
to
descendants
where
it
is
a
generating
factor
every
reflection
leaves
behind
it
a
double
effect
its
immediate
outcome
is
as
i
tried
to
show
earlier
the
direct
reorganization
of
a
situation
a
reorganization
which
confers
upon
its
contents
new
increments
of
intrinsic
meaning
its
indirect
and
intellectual
product
is
the
defining
of
a
meaning
which
when
fixed
by
a
suitable
existence
is
a
resource
in
subsequent
investigations
i
would
not
despise
the
assistance
lent
by
the
words
term
and
proposition
as
slang
has
it
a
pitched
baseball
is
to
the
batter
a
proposition
it
states
or
makes
explicit
what
he
has
to
deal
with
next
amid
all
the
surrounding
and
momentarily
irrelevant
circumstance
every
statement
extracts
and
sets
forth
the
net
result
of
reflection
up
to
date
as
a
condition
of
subsequent
reflection
this
extraction
of
the
kernel
of
past
reflections
makes
possible
a
throwing
to
one
side
of
all
the
consequences
of
prior
false
and
futile
steps
it
enables
one
to
dispense
with
the
experiences
themselves
and
to
deal
only
with
their
profit
in
a
favorite
phrase
of
realism
it
gives
an
object
as
if
there
were
no
experience
it
is
unnecessary
to
descant
upon
the
economy
of
this
procedure
it
eliminates
everything
which
in
spite
of
its
immediate
urgency
or
vividness
or
weight
of
past
authority
is
rubbish
for
the
purpose
in
hand
it
enables
one
to
get
down
to
business
with
just
that
which
presumably
is
of
importance
in
subsequent
procedure
it
is
no
wonder
that
these
logical
kernels
have
been
elevated
into
metaphysical
essences
the
word
term
suggests
the
limiting
condition
of
every
process
of
reflection
it
sets
a
fence
beyond
which
it
is
presumably
a
waste
to
wander
an
error
it
sets
forth
that
which
be
taken
into
account
a
limit
which
is
inescapable
something
which
is
to
ratiocination
what
the
brute
datum
is
to
observation
in
classic
phrase
it
is
a
notion
that
is
a
of
the
distinctions
which
have
been
fixed
for
the
purposes
of
the
kind
of
inquiry
now
engaged
in
one
has
only
to
compare
the
terms
of
present
scientific
discourse
with
those
of
say
aristotle
to
see
that
the
importance
of
terms
as
instruments
of
a
proper
survey
of
and
attack
upon
existential
situations
is
such
that
the
terms
resulting
naturally
and
spontaneously
from
reflection
have
been
dropped
and
more
effective
ones
substituted
in
one
sense
they
are
all
equally
objective
aquosity
is
as
genuine
as
well
as
more
obvious
a
notion
as
the
present
chemical
conception
but
the
latter
is
able
to
enter
a
much
wider
scope
of
inquiries
and
to
figure
in
them
more
prosperously
as
a
special
class
of
scientific
inquirers
develops
terms
that
were
originally
of
reflection
become
primary
objects
for
the
intellectual
class
the
troubles
which
occasion
reflection
are
then
troubles
discrepancies
within
some
current
scheme
of
propositions
and
terms
the
situation
which
undergoes
reorganization
and
increase
of
comprised
significance
is
that
of
the
of
specialized
investigation
nevertheless
the
same
general
method
recurs
within
it
and
the
resulting
objects
the
terms
and
propositions
are
for
all
except
those
who
produce
them
instruments
not
terminal
objects
the
objection
to
analytic
realism
as
a
metaphysics
of
existence
is
not
so
much
an
undue
formalism
as
its
affront
to
the
of
action
appreciation
and
affection
the
affront
due
to
hypostatizing
terms
into
objects
is
as
great
as
that
of
idealism
a
na√Øve
realism
withstands
both
affronts
my
interest
however
is
not
to
animadvert
upon
analytic
realism
it
is
to
show
how
the
main
tenets
of
instrumental
logic
stand
in
relation
to
considerations
which
although
ignored
by
the
idealism
which
was
current
when
the
theory
received
its
first
formulation
demand
attention
the
objective
status
of
data
and
terms
with
respect
to
states
of
mind
or
acts
of
awareness
i
have
tried
to
show
that
the
theory
without
mutilation
or
torturing
makes
provision
for
these
considerations
they
are
not
objections
to
it
they
are
considerations
which
are
involved
in
it
there
are
questions
at
issue
but
they
concern
not
matters
of
logic
but
matters
of
fact
they
are
questions
of
the
setting
of
certain
logical
distinctions
and
relations
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
schemes
i
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
what
has
been
said
save
that
the
tendency
of
the
analytic
realism
is
inevitably
to
treat
a
difference
between
the
logic
of
inquiry
and
of
dialectic
as
if
it
were
itself
a
matter
to
be
settled
by
the
logic
of
dialectic
i
confess
to
some
fear
that
a
philosophy
which
fails
to
identify
science
with
terms
and
propositions
about
things
which
are
not
terms
and
propositions
will
first
exaggerate
and
then
misconstrue
the
function
of
dialectics
and
land
philosophy
in
a
formalism
like
unto
the
scholasticism
from
which
the
older
empiricism
with
all
its
defects
emancipated
those
who
took
it
to
heart
vii
return
with
me
if
you
please
to
fundamentals
the
word
experience
is
used
freely
in
the
essays
and
without
much
explanation
in
view
of
the
currency
of
subjectivistic
interpretations
of
that
term
the
chief
wonder
is
probably
that
the
doctrine
of
the
essays
was
not
more
misunderstood
than
was
actually
the
case
i
have
already
said
something
designed
to
clarify
the
sense
in
which
the
term
was
used
i
now
come
back
to
the
matter
what
is
the
reason
for
using
the
term
at
all
in
philosophy
the
history
of
philosophy
supplies
i
think
the
answer
no
matter
how
subjective
a
turn
was
given
to
the
word
by
hume
and
kant
we
have
only
to
go
to
an
earlier
period
to
see
that
the
appeal
to
experience
in
philosophy
was
coincident
with
the
emancipation
of
science
from
occult
essences
and
causes
and
with
the
substitution
of
methods
of
observation
controlled
by
experimentation
and
employing
mathematical
considerations
for
methods
of
mere
dialectic
definition
and
classification
the
appeal
to
experience
was
the
cry
of
the
man
from
missouri
the
demand
to
be
shown
it
sprang
from
the
desire
to
command
nature
by
observing
her
instead
of
anticipating
her
in
order
to
deck
her
with
aesthetic
garlands
and
hold
her
with
theological
chains
the
significance
of
experience
was
not
that
sun
and
moon
stick
and
stone
are
creatures
of
the
senses
but
that
men
would
not
put
their
trust
any
longer
in
things
which
are
said
however
authoritatively
to
exist
unless
these
things
are
capable
of
entering
into
specifiable
connections
with
the
organism
and
the
organism
with
them
it
was
an
emphatic
assertion
that
until
men
could
see
things
got
into
belief
and
what
they
did
when
they
got
there
intellectual
acceptance
would
be
withheld
has
not
the
lesson
however
been
so
well
learned
that
we
can
drop
reference
to
experience
would
that
such
were
the
case
but
the
time
does
not
seem
to
have
come
some
things
enter
by
way
of
the
imagination
stimulated
by
emotional
preferences
and
biases
for
purposes
they
are
not
the
worse
for
having
entered
by
that
gate
instead
of
through
adjustments
or
they
may
have
entered
because
of
the
love
of
man
for
logical
form
and
symmetry
and
system
and
because
of
the
emotional
satisfaction
which
harmony
awakens
in
a
sensitive
soul
they
too
need
not
be
any
worse
for
all
that
but
surely
it
is
among
the
businesses
of
philosophy
to
discriminate
between
the
kinds
of
goodness
possessed
by
different
kinds
of
things
and
how
can
it
discriminate
unless
by
telling
by
what
road
they
got
into
our
experience
and
what
they
do
after
they
get
there
assuredly
the
difference
is
not
in
content
it
is
not
because
of
and
traits
of
the
immediate
terms
that
dante
world
belongs
to
poetry
and
newton
to
scientific
astronomy
no
amount
of
pure
inspection
and
excogitation
could
decide
which
belongs
to
which
world
the
difference
in
status
and
claim
is
made
by
what
we
call
experience
by
the
place
of
the
two
systems
in
experience
with
respect
to
their
generation
and
consequences
and
assuredly
any
philosophy
which
takes
science
to
be
not
an
of
the
world
which
it
is
but
a
literal
and
exhaustive
apprehension
of
it
in
its
full
reality
a
philosophy
which
therefore
has
no
place
for
poetry
or
possibilities
still
needs
a
theory
of
experience
if
a
scientific
man
be
asked
what
is
truth
he
will
reply
if
he
frame
his
reply
in
terms
of
his
practice
and
not
of
some
convention
that
which
is
accepted
upon
adequate
evidence
and
if
he
is
asked
for
a
description
of
adequacy
of
evidence
he
certainly
will
refer
to
matters
of
observation
and
experiment
it
is
not
the
character
of
the
terms
and
propositions
nor
their
systematic
ordering
which
settles
the
case
for
him
it
is
the
way
they
were
obtained
and
what
he
can
do
with
them
in
getting
other
things
and
when
a
mathematician
or
logician
asks
philosophy
to
abandon
this
method
then
is
just
the
time
to
be
most
vigorous
in
insisting
upon
the
necessity
of
reference
to
experience
in
order
to
fix
the
import
of
mathematical
and
logical
pretensions
when
students
influenced
by
the
symmetry
and
system
of
mathematics
cease
building
up
their
philosophies
in
terms
of
traits
of
mathematical
in
isolation
then
empirical
philosophers
will
have
less
call
to
mention
experience
meantime
i
know
of
no
way
of
fixing
the
scope
and
claims
of
mathematics
in
philosophy
save
to
try
to
point
out
just
at
what
juncture
it
enters
experience
and
what
work
it
does
after
it
has
got
entrance
i
have
made
such
an
attempt
in
my
account
of
the
fixation
and
handling
of
suggestions
as
meanings
it
is
defective
enough
but
the
defects
are
to
be
remedied
by
a
better
empirical
account
and
not
by
setting
up
against
experience
the
claims
of
a
logic
aloof
from
experience
the
objection
then
to
a
logic
which
rules
out
knowledge
getting
and
which
bases
logic
exclusively
upon
the
traits
of
known
objects
is
that
it
is
there
is
no
way
to
know
what
are
the
traits
of
known
objects
as
distinct
from
imaginary
objects
or
objects
of
opinion
or
objects
of
unanalytic
save
by
referring
to
the
operations
of
getting
using
and
testing
evidence
the
processes
of
knowledge
getting
i
am
making
no
appeal
for
skepticism
at
large
i
am
not
questioning
the
right
of
the
physicist
the
mathematician
or
the
symbolic
logicist
to
go
ahead
with
accepted
objects
and
do
what
he
can
with
them
i
am
pointing
out
that
anyone
who
professes
to
be
concerned
with
finding
out
what
knowledge
has
for
his
primary
work
the
job
of
finding
out
why
it
is
so
much
safer
to
proceed
with
just
these
objects
than
with
those
say
of
aristotelian
science
aristotle
was
not
lacking
in
acuteness
nor
in
learning
to
him
it
was
clear
that
objects
of
knowledge
are
the
things
of
ordinary
perception
so
far
as
they
are
referred
to
a
form
which
comparison
of
perceived
things
in
the
light
of
a
final
cause
makes
evident
if
this
view
of
the
objects
of
knowledge
has
gone
into
the
discard
if
quite
other
objects
of
knowledge
are
now
received
and
employed
it
is
because
the
methods
of
knowledge
have
been
transformed
till
for
the
working
scientist
objects
of
knowledge
mean
precisely
the
objects
which
have
been
obtained
by
approved
processes
of
inquiry
to
exclude
consideration
of
these
processes
is
thus
to
throw
away
the
key
to
understanding
knowledge
and
its
objects
there
is
a
certain
ironical
humor
in
taking
advantage
of
all
the
improved
methods
of
experimental
inquiry
with
respect
to
all
objects
of
knowledge
save
one
knowledge
itself
in
denying
their
relevancy
to
knowing
knowledge
and
falling
back
upon
the
method
everywhere
else
disavowed
the
method
of
relying
upon
isolated
properties
of
one
of
the
points
which
gave
much
offense
in
the
essays
was
the
reference
to
genetic
method
to
a
natural
history
of
knowledge
i
hope
what
has
now
been
said
makes
clearer
the
nature
of
that
reference
i
was
to
blame
for
not
making
the
point
more
explicit
but
i
can
not
altogether
blame
myself
for
my
na√Øvet√©
in
supposing
that
others
understood
by
a
natural
history
of
knowledge
what
i
understood
by
it
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
anyone
would
think
that
the
history
by
which
human
ignorance
error
dogma
and
superstition
had
been
transformed
even
in
its
present
degree
of
transformation
into
knowledge
was
something
which
had
gone
on
exclusively
inside
of
heads
or
in
an
inner
consciousness
i
thought
of
it
as
something
going
on
in
the
world
in
the
observatory
and
the
laboratory
and
in
the
application
of
laboratory
results
to
the
control
of
human
health
and
progress
when
a
biologist
says
that
the
way
to
understand
an
organ
or
the
sociologist
that
the
way
to
know
an
institution
resides
in
its
genesis
and
history
he
is
understood
to
mean
history
i
took
the
same
liberty
for
knowledge
that
is
for
science
the
accusation
of
subjectivisim
taken
in
this
light
appears
as
a
depressing
revelation
of
what
the
current
opinion
about
the
processes
of
knowledge
is
to
stumble
on
a
stone
need
not
be
a
process
of
knowledge
to
hit
it
with
a
hammer
to
pour
acid
upon
it
to
put
pieces
in
the
crucible
to
subject
things
to
heat
and
pressure
to
see
if
one
can
make
a
similar
stone
processes
of
knowledge
so
is
fixing
suggestions
by
attaching
names
and
so
is
devising
ways
of
putting
these
terms
together
so
that
new
suggestions
will
arise
or
so
that
suggestions
may
be
transferred
from
one
situation
to
another
but
not
one
of
these
processes
is
subjective
in
any
sense
which
puts
subjectivity
in
opposition
to
the
public
world
of
nature
and
human
companionship
to
set
genesis
in
opposition
to
analysis
is
merely
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
sciences
of
existence
have
found
that
considerations
of
genesis
afford
their
most
effective
methods
of
analysis
the
same
kind
of
consideration
applies
to
the
favorable
view
taken
of
psychology
if
reference
to
modes
and
ways
of
experience
to
experiencing
is
important
for
understanding
the
things
with
which
philosophy
deals
then
psychology
is
useful
as
a
matter
of
course
for
what
is
meant
by
psychology
is
precisely
a
discrimination
of
the
acts
and
attitudes
of
the
organism
which
have
a
bearing
upon
respective
and
which
have
accordingly
to
be
taken
account
of
before
the
can
be
properly
discriminated
the
matter
was
especially
striking
in
the
case
of
lotze
he
protested
constantly
against
the
use
of
psychology
and
yet
his
own
data
and
procedures
were
infected
at
every
turn
by
psychology
and
if
i
am
at
all
correct
by
a
false
psychology
the
particular
separation
which
he
made
between
psychology
and
logic
rested
indeed
upon
a
particular
psychological
assumption
the
question
is
worth
asking
is
not
the
marked
aversion
on
the
part
of
some
philosophers
to
any
reference
to
psychology
a
freudian
symptom
a
word
more
upon
the
place
assigned
by
the
essays
to
and
and
the
humanistic
factor
generally
to
save
time
i
may
quote
a
sentence
from
an
early
review
which
attributes
to
the
essays
the
following
doctrine
if
the
plan
turns
out
to
be
useful
for
our
need
it
is
correct
the
judgment
is
true
the
distinction
is
that
between
stimulus
of
environment
and
plan
of
action
or
tentative
response
both
real
and
ideal
are
equally
experiences
of
the
individual
man
these
words
can
be
interpreted
either
so
as
to
convey
the
position
fairly
or
so
as
radically
to
misconceive
it
the
latter
course
is
a
little
easier
as
the
words
stand
that
real
and
ideal
are
experiences
of
the
individual
man
in
the
sense
that
they
actually
present
themselves
as
specifications
which
can
be
studied
by
any
man
who
desires
to
study
them
is
true
enough
that
such
a
study
is
as
much
required
for
determining
their
characters
as
it
is
for
determining
those
of
carbon
dioxide
or
of
the
constitution
of
great
britain
is
also
the
contention
of
the
paper
but
if
the
words
quoted
suggest
to
anyone
that
the
real
or
even
the
ideal
are
somehow
possessions
of
an
individual
man
things
secreted
somewhere
about
him
and
then
ejected
i
can
only
say
that
i
can
not
understand
the
doctrine
i
know
of
no
and
antecedent
conception
of
the
individual
man
instead
of
telling
about
the
nature
of
experience
by
means
of
a
prior
conception
of
individual
man
i
find
it
necessary
to
go
to
experience
to
find
out
what
is
meant
by
individual
and
by
man
and
also
by
the
consequently
even
in
such
an
expression
as
my
experience
i
should
wish
not
to
contradict
this
idea
of
method
by
using
the
term
my
to
swallow
up
the
term
experience
any
more
than
if
i
said
my
house
or
my
country
on
the
contrary
i
should
expect
that
any
intelligible
and
definite
use
of
such
phrases
would
throw
much
more
light
upon
me
than
upon
house
or
country
or
experience
the
possible
misunderstanding
is
i
think
actual
in
the
reference
to
our
needs
as
a
criterion
of
the
correctness
of
truth
of
an
idea
or
plan
according
to
the
essays
it
is
the
needs
of
a
which
are
determinative
they
evoke
thought
and
the
need
of
knowing
and
it
is
only
within
the
situation
that
the
identification
of
the
needs
with
a
self
occurs
and
it
is
only
by
reflection
upon
the
place
of
the
agent
in
the
encompassing
situation
that
the
nature
of
needs
can
be
determined
in
fact
the
actual
occurrence
of
a
disturbed
incomplete
and
needy
indicates
that
present
need
is
precisely
to
investigate
to
explore
to
hunt
to
pull
apart
things
now
tied
together
to
project
to
plan
to
invent
and
then
to
test
the
outcome
by
seeing
how
it
works
as
a
method
of
dealing
with
hard
facts
one
source
of
the
demand
in
short
for
reference
to
experience
as
the
encompassing
universe
of
discourse
is
to
keep
us
from
taking
such
terms
as
self
my
need
satisfaction
as
terms
whose
meanings
can
be
accepted
and
proved
either
by
themselves
or
by
even
the
most
extensive
dialectic
reference
to
other
terms
terms
like
real
and
ideal
individual
man
my
certainly
allow
of
profitable
dialectic
or
purely
prepositional
clarification
and
elaboration
but
nothing
is
settled
until
these
discursive
findings
have
been
applied
through
action
to
things
and
an
experience
has
been
effected
which
either
meets
or
evades
the
specification
conceptually
laid
down
to
suppose
for
example
that
the
import
of
the
term
ideal
can
be
settled
apart
from
exhibiting
in
experience
some
specific
affair
is
to
maintain
in
philosophy
that
belief
in
the
occult
essence
and
hidden
cause
which
science
had
to
get
rid
of
before
it
got
on
the
right
track
the
idealistic
misconception
of
experience
is
no
reason
for
throwing
away
its
significant
point
of
contact
with
modern
science
and
for
having
recourse
then
to
objects
distinguished
from
an
only
because
they
involve
just
that
reference
to
those
experiences
by
which
they
were
established
and
to
which
they
are
applied
that
propositional
or
analytic
realism
professedly
and
elaborately
ignores
in
revenge
this
ignoring
leaves
on
our
hands
the
me
or
knowing
self
as
a
separate
thing
within
which
experience
falls
instead
of
its
falling
in
a
specifiable
place
within
experience
and
generates
the
insoluble
problem
of
how
a
subjective
experience
can
beget
objective
knowledge
in
concluding
let
me
say
that
reference
to
experience
seems
at
present
to
be
the
easiest
way
of
realizing
the
continuities
among
that
are
always
getting
split
up
into
dualisms
a
creation
of
a
world
of
subsistences
or
essences
which
are
quite
other
than
the
world
of
natural
existences
which
are
other
than
natural
existences
adapted
to
the
successful
performance
of
inference
is
in
itself
a
technical
matter
though
a
discouraging
one
to
a
philosopher
expertly
acquainted
with
all
the
difficulties
which
that
view
has
generated
from
the
time
of
plato
down
but
the
assistance
which
such
a
philosophy
lends
to
the
practical
and
current
divorce
of
the
ideal
from
the
natural
world
makes
it
a
thing
to
be
dreaded
for
other
than
professional
reasons
god
only
knows
how
many
of
the
sufferings
of
life
are
due
to
a
belief
that
the
natural
scene
and
operations
of
our
life
are
lacking
in
ideal
import
and
to
the
consequent
tendency
to
flee
for
the
lacking
ideal
factors
to
some
other
world
inhabited
exclusively
by
ideals
that
such
a
ideal
world
is
impotent
for
direction
and
control
and
change
of
the
natural
world
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
a
luxury
it
belongs
to
the
genteel
tradition
of
life
the
persistence
of
an
upper
class
given
to
a
detached
and
parasitic
life
moreover
it
places
the
scientific
inquirer
within
that
irresponsible
class
if
philosophers
could
aid
in
making
it
clear
to
a
troubled
humanity
that
ideals
are
continuous
with
natural
events
that
they
but
represent
their
possibilities
and
that
recognized
possibilities
form
methods
for
a
conduct
which
may
realize
them
in
fact
philosophers
would
enforce
the
sense
of
a
social
calling
and
responsibility
i
do
not
say
that
pointing
out
the
continuity
and
interaction
of
various
attitudes
and
interests
in
experience
is
the
only
way
of
effecting
this
consummation
but
for
a
large
number
of
persons
today
it
is
the
readiest
way
much
may
be
said
about
that
other
great
rupture
of
continuity
which
analytic
realism
would
maintain
that
between
the
world
and
the
knower
as
something
outside
of
it
engaged
in
an
otiose
contemplative
survey
of
it
i
can
understand
the
social
conditions
which
generated
this
conception
of
an
aloof
knower
i
can
see
how
it
protected
the
growth
of
responsible
inquiry
which
takes
effect
in
change
of
the
environment
by
cultivating
a
sense
of
the
innocuousness
of
knowing
and
thus
lulling
to
sleep
the
animosity
of
those
who
being
in
control
had
no
desire
to
permit
reflection
which
had
practical
import
i
can
see
how
specialists
at
any
time
professional
knowers
so
to
speak
find
in
this
doctrine
a
salve
for
conscience
a
solace
which
all
thinkers
need
as
long
as
an
effective
share
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
is
not
permitted
them
above
all
i
can
see
how
seclusion
and
the
absence
of
the
pressure
of
immediate
action
developed
a
more
varied
curiosity
greater
impartiality
and
a
more
generous
outlook
but
all
this
is
no
reason
for
continuing
the
idealization
of
a
remote
and
separate
mind
or
knower
now
that
the
method
of
intelligence
is
perfected
and
changed
social
conditions
not
only
permit
but
demand
that
intelligence
be
placed
within
the
procession
of
events
an
intellectual
integrity
an
impartiality
and
detachment
which
is
maintained
only
in
seclusion
is
unpleasantly
reminiscent
of
other
identifications
of
virtue
with
the
innocence
of
ignorance
to
place
knowledge
where
it
arises
and
operates
in
experience
is
to
know
that
as
it
arose
because
of
the
troubles
of
man
it
is
confirmed
in
reconstructing
the
conditions
which
occasioned
those
troubles
genuine
intellectual
integrity
is
found
in
experimental
knowing
until
this
lesson
is
fully
learned
it
is
not
safe
to
dissociate
knowledge
from
experiment
nor
experiment
from
experience
footnotes
i
am
indebted
to
an
unpublished
manuscript
of
klyce
of
winchester
massachusetts
for
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
our
words
divide
into
of
which
more
in
the
sequel
and
into
names
which
are
not
strictly
speaking
terms
at
all
but
which
serve
to
remind
us
of
the
vast
and
vague
continuum
select
portions
of
which
only
are
designated
by
words
as
he
calls
such
words
infinity
and
zero
words
the
word
experience
is
a
typical
instance
of
an
infinity
word
klyce
has
brought
out
very
clearly
that
a
direct
situation
of
experience
situation
as
i
employ
it
is
another
such
word
has
no
need
of
any
word
for
itself
the
thing
to
which
the
word
would
point
being
so
egregiously
there
on
its
own
behalf
but
when
communication
about
it
takes
place
as
it
does
not
only
in
converse
with
others
but
when
a
man
attempts
a
mutual
reference
of
different
periods
of
his
own
life
a
word
is
needed
to
remind
both
parties
of
this
whole
another
infinity
term
while
confusion
arises
if
explicit
attention
is
not
called
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
very
different
sort
of
word
from
the
definite
terms
of
discourse
which
denote
distinctions
and
their
relations
to
one
another
in
the
text
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
the
business
man
wrestling
with
a
difficulty
or
a
scientific
man
engaged
in
an
inquiry
finds
his
checks
and
control
specifically
in
the
situation
in
which
he
is
employed
while
the
theorizer
at
large
leaves
out
these
checks
and
limits
and
so
loses
his
clews
well
the
words
experience
situation
are
used
to
the
thinker
of
the
need
of
reversion
to
precisely
something
which
never
can
be
one
of
the
terms
of
his
reflection
but
which
nevertheless
furnishes
the
existential
meaning
and
status
of
them
all
intuition
mysticism
philosophized
or
sophisticated
monism
are
all
of
them
aberrant
ways
of
protesting
against
the
consequences
which
result
from
failing
to
note
what
is
conveyed
by
words
which
are
not
terms
were
i
rewriting
these
essays
i
should
try
to
take
advantage
of
these
and
other
indispensable
considerations
advanced
by
klyce
but
as
the
essays
must
stand
substantially
as
they
were
originally
written
and
as
an
introduction
to
them
must
in
order
to
be
intelligible
be
stated
in
not
incongruous
phraseology
i
wish
simply
to
ask
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
this
radical
difference
between
such
words
as
experience
reality
universe
situation
and
such
terms
as
typewriter
me
consciousness
existence
when
used
as
they
must
be
used
if
they
are
to
be
terms
in
a
differential
sense
the
term
reality
is
particularly
treacherous
for
the
careless
tradition
of
philosophy
a
carelessness
fostered
i
am
sure
by
failure
to
make
verbally
explicit
the
distinction
to
which
klyce
has
called
attention
uses
reality
both
as
a
term
of
indifferent
reference
equivalent
to
everything
taken
together
or
referred
to
as
over
against
some
discrimination
and
also
as
a
discriminative
term
with
a
highly
eulogistic
flavor
as
money
in
distinction
from
counterfeit
money
then
although
every
inquiry
in
daily
life
whether
technological
or
scientific
asks
a
thing
is
real
only
in
the
sense
of
asking
thing
is
real
philosophy
concludes
to
a
wholesale
distinction
between
the
real
and
the
unreal
the
real
and
the
apparent
and
so
creates
a
wholly
artificial
problem
if
the
philosopher
whether
idealistic
or
realistic
who
holds
that
it
is
to
criticize
purely
intellectualistic
conceptions
of
the
world
because
the
criticism
itself
goes
on
intellectualistic
terms
so
that
its
validity
depends
upon
intellectual
or
cognitive
conditions
will
but
think
of
the
very
brute
doings
in
which
a
chemist
engages
to
fix
the
meanings
of
his
terms
and
to
test
his
theories
and
conceptions
he
will
perceive
that
all
intellectual
knowing
is
but
a
method
for
conducting
an
experiment
and
that
arguments
and
objections
are
but
stimuli
to
induce
somebody
to
try
a
certain
experiment
to
have
recourse
that
is
to
a
affair
or
again
the
argument
is
an
invitation
to
him
to
note
that
at
the
very
time
in
which
he
is
thinking
his
thinking
is
set
in
a
continuum
which
is
not
an
object
of
thought
the
importance
attached
to
the
word
experience
then
both
in
the
essays
and
in
this
introduction
is
to
be
understood
as
an
invitation
to
employ
thought
and
discriminative
knowledge
as
a
means
of
plunging
into
something
which
no
argument
and
no
term
can
express
or
rather
as
an
invitation
to
note
the
fact
that
no
plunge
is
needed
since
one
own
thinking
and
explicit
knowledge
are
already
constituted
by
and
within
something
which
does
not
need
to
be
expressed
or
made
explicit
and
finally
there
is
nothing
mystical
about
this
though
mysticism
doubtless
roots
in
this
fact
its
import
is
only
to
call
notice
to
the
meaning
of
say
formulae
communicated
by
a
chemist
to
others
as
the
result
of
his
experiment
all
that
can
be
communicated
or
expressed
is
that
one
believes
such
and
such
a
thing
the
communication
has
scientific
instead
of
merely
social
significance
because
the
communicated
formula
is
a
direction
to
other
chemists
to
try
certain
procedures
and
see
what
they
get
the
is
capable
of
expression
the
result
of
the
experiment
the
experience
to
which
the
propositions
refer
and
by
which
they
are
tested
is
not
expressible
poetry
of
course
is
a
more
competent
organ
of
suggesting
it
than
scientific
prose
the
word
experience
is
i
repeat
a
notation
of
an
inexpressible
as
that
which
decides
the
ultimate
status
of
all
which
is
expressed
inexpressible
not
because
it
is
so
remote
and
transcendent
but
because
it
is
so
immediately
engrossing
and
matter
of
course
there
are
certain
points
of
similarity
between
this
doctrine
and
that
of
holt
regarding
contradictions
and
that
of
montague
regarding
consciousness
as
a
case
of
potential
energy
but
the
latter
doctrine
seems
to
me
to
suffer
first
from
an
isolation
of
the
brain
from
the
organism
which
leads
to
ignoring
the
active
doing
and
secondly
from
an
isolation
of
the
moment
of
reduction
of
actual
to
potential
energy
it
appears
as
a
curiously
isolated
and
event
instead
of
as
the
focus
of
readjustment
in
an
organized
activity
at
the
pivotal
point
of
maximum
tension
that
is
of
greatest
inhibition
in
connection
with
greatest
tendency
to
discharge
and
while
i
think
holt
is
wholly
right
in
connecting
the
possibility
of
error
with
objectively
plural
and
conflicting
forces
i
should
hardly
regard
it
as
linguistically
expedient
to
call
counterbalancing
forces
contradictory
the
counterbalancing
forces
of
the
vaulting
do
not
seem
to
me
contradictory
in
the
arch
but
if
their
presence
led
me
to
attempt
to
say
up
and
down
at
the
same
time
there
would
be
contradiction
but
even
admitting
that
contradictory
propositions
are
merely
about
forces
which
are
contradictory
heating
and
cooling
it
is
still
a
long
way
to
error
for
propositions
about
such
contradictions
are
obviously
true
propositions
it
is
only
when
we
make
that
reaction
to
one
factor
which
is
appropriate
to
dealing
with
the
other
that
there
is
error
and
this
can
happen
where
there
are
no
contradictory
forces
at
all
beyond
the
fact
that
the
is
pulled
two
incompatible
and
opposed
ways
at
the
same
time
for
emphasis
i
am
here
exaggerating
by
condensing
into
a
single
decisive
act
an
operation
which
is
continuously
going
on
i
would
remark
in
passing
that
a
recognition
that
a
thing
may
be
continuous
in
one
respect
and
discrete
in
another
would
obviate
a
good
many
difficulties
in
effect
the
fallacy
is
the
same
as
that
of
an
idealistic
theory
which
holds
that
all
objects
are
really
associations
of
sensations
this
statement
is
meant
literally
the
sensations
of
color
sound
to
which
appeal
is
made
in
a
scientific
inquiry
are
nothing
mental
in
structure
or
stuff
they
are
actual
things
analyzed
down
to
what
is
so
indubitably
there
that
it
may
safely
be
taken
as
a
basis
of
inference
a
term
is
not
of
course
a
mere
word
a
mere
word
is
for
a
sound
by
itself
is
not
a
word
at
all
nor
is
it
a
mere
meaning
which
is
not
even
natural
being
if
it
be
at
all
supernatural
or
transcendental
nonsense
terms
signify
that
certain
absent
existences
are
indicated
by
certain
given
existences
in
the
respect
that
they
are
abstracted
and
fixed
for
intellectual
use
by
some
physically
convenient
means
such
as
a
sound
or
a
muscular
contraction
of
the
vocal
organs
this
distinction
of
indication
as
existential
and
implication
as
conceptual
or
essential
i
owe
to
alfred
sidgwick
see
his
james
ii
i
have
even
seen
in
a
criticism
of
the
essays
the
method
of
genesis
opposed
to
the
method
of
experimentation
as
if
experimentation
were
anything
but
the
generation
of
some
special
object
ii
the
relationship
of
thought
and
its
no
one
doubts
that
thought
at
least
reflective
as
distinct
from
what
is
sometimes
called
constitutive
thought
is
derivative
and
secondary
it
comes
after
something
and
out
of
something
and
for
the
sake
of
something
no
one
doubts
that
the
thinking
of
everyday
practical
life
and
of
science
is
of
this
reflective
type
we
think
about
we
reflect
over
if
we
ask
what
it
is
which
is
primary
and
radical
to
thought
if
we
ask
what
is
the
final
objective
for
the
sake
of
which
thought
intervenes
if
we
ask
in
what
sense
we
are
to
understand
thought
as
a
derived
procedure
we
are
plunging
ourselves
into
the
very
heart
of
the
logical
problem
the
relation
of
thought
to
its
empirical
antecedents
and
to
its
consequent
truth
and
the
relation
of
truth
to
reality
yet
from
the
na√Øve
point
of
view
no
difficulty
attaches
to
these
questions
the
antecedents
of
thought
are
our
universe
of
life
and
love
of
appreciation
and
struggle
we
think
about
anything
and
everything
snow
on
the
ground
the
alternating
clanks
and
thuds
that
rise
from
below
the
relation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
embroglio
in
venezuela
the
relation
of
art
to
industry
the
poetic
quality
of
a
painting
by
botticelli
the
battle
of
marathon
the
economic
interpretation
of

the
proper
definition
of

the
best
method
of
reducing
expenses
whether
and
how
to
renew
the
ties
of
a
broken
friendship
the
interpretation
of
an
equation
in
hydrodynamics
etc
through
the
madness
of
this
miscellaneous
citation
there
appears
so
much
of
method
anything
event
act
value
ideal
person
or
place
may
be
an
object
of
thought
reflection
busies
itself
alike
with
physical
nature
the
record
of
social
achievement
and
the
endeavors
of
social
aspiration
it
is
with
reference
to
affairs
that
thought
is
derivative
it
is
with
reference
to
them
that
it
intervenes
or
mediates
taking
some
part
of
the
universe
of
action
of
affection
of
social
construction
under
its
special
charge
and
having
busied
itself
therewith
sufficiently
to
meet
the
special
difficulty
presented
thought
releases
that
topic
and
enters
into
further
more
direct
experience
sticking
for
a
moment
to
this
na√Øve
standpoint
we
recognize
a
certain
rhythm
of
direct
practice
and
derived
theory
of
primary
construction
and
of
secondary
criticism
of
living
appreciation
and
of
abstract
description
of
active
endeavor
and
of
pale
reflection
we
find
that
every
more
direct
primary
attitude
passes
upon
occasion
into
its
secondary
deliberative
and
discursive
counterpart
we
find
that
when
the
latter
has
done
its
work
it
passes
away
and
passes
on
from
the
na√Øve
standpoint
such
rhythm
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
there
is
no
attempt
either
to
state
the
nature
of
the
occasion
which
demands
the
thinking
attitude
or
to
formulate
a
theory
of
the
standard
by
which
is
judged
its
success
no
general
theory
is
propounded
as
to
the
exact
relationship
between
thinking
and
what
antecedes
and
succeeds
it
much
less
do
we
ask
how
empirical
circumstances
can
generate
rationality
of
thought
nor
how
it
is
possible
for
reflection
to
lay
claim
to
power
of
determining
truth
and
thereby
of
constructing
further
reality
if
we
were
to
ask
the
thinking
of
na√Øve
life
to
present
with
a
minimum
of
theoretical
elaboration
its
conception
of
its
own
practice
we
should
get
an
answer
running
not
unlike
this
thinking
is
a
kind
of
activity
which
we
perform
at
specific
need
just
as
at
other
need
we
engage
in
other
sorts
of
activity
as
converse
with
a
friend
draw
a
plan
for
a
house
take
a
walk
eat
a
dinner
purchase
a
suit
of
clothes
etc
in
general
its
material
is
anything
in
the
wide
universe
which
seems
to
be
relevant
to
this
need
anything
which
may
serve
as
a
resource
in
defining
the
difficulty
or
in
suggesting
modes
of
dealing
effectively
with
it
the
measure
of
its
success
the
standard
of
its
validity
is
precisely
the
degree
in
which
the
thinking
actually
disposes
of
the
difficulty
and
allows
us
to
proceed
with
more
direct
modes
of
experiencing
that
are
forthwith
possessed
of
more
assured
and
deepened
value
if
we
inquire
why
the
na√Øve
attitude
does
not
go
on
to
elaborate
these
implications
of
its
own
practice
into
a
systematic
theory
the
answer
on
its
own
basis
is
obvious
thought
arises
in
response
to
its
own
occasion
and
this
occasion
is
so
exacting
that
there
is
time
as
there
is
need
only
to
do
the
thinking
which
is
needed
in
that
occasion
not
to
reflect
upon
the
thinking
itself
reflection
follows
so
naturally
upon
its
appropriate
cue
its
issue
is
so
obvious
so
practical
the
entire
relationship
is
so
organic
that
once
grant
the
position
that
thought
arises
in
reaction
to
specific
demand
and
there
is
not
the
particular
type
of
thinking
called
logical
theory
because
there
is
not
the
practical
demand
for
reflection
of
that
sort
our
attention
is
taken
up
with
particular
questions
and
specific
answers
what
we
have
to
reckon
with
is
not
the
problem
of
how
can
i
think
but
how
shall
i
think
right
and
not
what
is
the
test
of
thought
at
large
but
what
validates
and
confirms
thought
in
conformity
with
this
view
it
follows
that
a
generic
account
of
our
thinking
behavior
the
generic
account
termed
logical
theory
arises
at
historic
periods
in
which
the
situation
has
lost
the
organic
character
above
described
the
general
theory
of
reflection
as
over
against
its
concrete
exercise
appears
when
occasions
for
reflection
are
so
overwhelming
and
so
mutually
conflicting
that
specific
adequate
response
in
thought
is
blocked
again
it
shows
itself
when
practical
affairs
are
so
multifarious
complicated
and
remote
from
control
that
thinking
is
held
off
from
successful
passage
into
them
anyhow
sticking
to
the
na√Øve
standpoint
it
is
true
that
the
stimulus
to
that
particular
form
of
reflective
thinking
termed
logical
theory
is
found
when
circumstances
require
the
act
of
thinking
and
nevertheless
impede
clear
and
coherent
thinking
in
detail
or
when
they
occasion
thought
and
then
prevent
the
results
of
thinking
from
exercising
directive
influence
upon
the
immediate
concerns
of
life
under
these
conditions
we
get
such
questions
as
the
following
what
is
the
relation
of
rational
thought
to
crude
or
unreflective
experience
what
is
the
relation
of
thought
to
reality
what
is
the
barrier
which
prevents
reason
from
complete
penetration
into
the
world
of
truth
what
is
it
that
makes
us
live
alternately
in
a
concrete
world
of
experience
in
which
thought
as
such
finds
not
satisfaction
and
in
a
world
of
ordered
thought
which
is
yet
only
abstract
and
ideal
it
is
not
my
intention
here
to
pursue
the
line
of
historical
inquiry
thus
suggested
indeed
the
point
would
not
be
mentioned
did
it
not
serve
to
fix
attention
upon
the
nature
of
the
logical
problem
it
is
in
dealing
with
this
latter
type
of
question
that
logical
theory
has
taken
a
turn
which
separates
it
widely
from
the
theoretical
implications
of
practical
deliberation
and
of
scientific
research
the
two
latter
however
much
they
differ
from
each
other
in
detail
agree
in
a
fundamental
principle
they
both
assume
that
every
reflective
problem
and
operation
arises
with
reference
to
some
situation
and
has
to
subserve
a
purpose
dependent
upon
its
own
occasion
they
assume
and
observe
distinct
limits
limits
from
which
and
to
which
there
is
the
limit
of
origin
in
the
needs
of
the
particular
situation
which
evokes
reflection
there
is
the
limit
of
terminus
in
successful
dealing
with
the
particular
problem
presented
or
in
retiring
baffled
to
take
up
some
other
question
the
query
that
at
once
faces
us
regarding
the
nature
of
logical
theory
is
whether
reflection
upon
reflection
shall
recognize
these
limits
endeavoring
to
formulate
them
more
exactly
and
to
define
their
relationships
to
each
other
more
adequately
or
shall
it
abolish
limits
do
away
with
the
matter
of
specific
conditions
and
specific
aims
of
thought
and
discuss
thought
and
its
relation
to
empirical
antecedents
and
rational
consequents
truth
at
large
at
first
blush
it
might
seem
as
if
the
very
nature
of
logical
theory
as
generalization
of
the
reflective
process
must
of
necessity
disregard
the
matter
of
particular
conditions
and
particular
results
as
irrelevant
how
the
implication
runs
could
reflection
become
generalized
save
by
elimination
of
details
as
irrelevant
such
a
conception
in
fixing
the
central
problem
of
logic
fixes
once
for
all
its
future
career
and
material
the
essential
business
of
logic
is
henceforth
to
discuss
the
relation
of
thought
as
such
to
reality
as
such
it
may
indeed
involve
much
psychological
material
particularly
in
the
discussion
of
the
processes
which
antecede
thinking
and
which
call
it
out
it
may
involve
much
discussion
of
the
concrete
methods
of
investigation
and
verification
employed
in
the
various
sciences
it
may
busily
concern
itself
with
the
differentiation
of
various
types
and
forms
of
thought
different
modes
of
conceiving
various
conformations
of
judgment
various
types
of
inferential
reasoning
but
it
concerns
itself
with
any
and
all
of
these
three
fields
not
on
their
own
account
or
as
ultimate
but
as
subsidiary
to
the
main
problem
the
relation
of
thought
as
such
or
at
large
to
reality
as
such
or
at
large
some
of
the
detailed
considerations
referred
to
may
throw
light
upon
the
terms
under
which
thought
transacts
its
business
with
reality
upon
say
certain
peculiar
limitations
it
has
to
submit
to
as
best
it
may
other
considerations
throw
light
upon
the
ways
in
which
thought
gets
at
reality
still
other
considerations
throw
light
upon
the
forms
which
thought
assumes
in
attacking
and
apprehending
reality
but
in
the
end
all
this
is
incidental
in
the
end
the
one
problem
holds
how
do
the
specifications
of
thought
as
such
hold
good
of
reality
as
such
in
fine
logic
is
supposed
to
grow
out
of
the
epistemological
inquiry
and
to
lead
up
to
its
solution
from
this
point
of
view
various
aspects
of
logical
theory
are
well
stated
by
an
author
whom
later
on
we
shall
consider
in
some
detail
lotze
refers
to
universal
forms
and
principles
of
thought
which
hold
good
everywhere
both
in
judging
of
reality
and
in
weighing
possibility
of
any
difference
in
the
this
defines
the
business
of
logic
this
is
clearly
the
question
of
thought
as
such
of
thought
at
large
or
in
general
then
we
have
the
question
of
how
far
the
most
complete
structure
of
thought
can
claim
to
be
an
adequate
account
of
that
which
we
seem
compelled
to
assume
as
the
object
and
occasion
of
our
ideas
this
is
clearly
the
question
of
the
relation
of
thought
at
large
to
reality
at
large
it
is
epistemology
then
comes
applied
logic
having
to
do
with
the
actual
employment
of
concrete
forms
of
thought
with
reference
to
investigation
of
specific
topics
and
subjects
this
applied
logic
would
if
the
standpoint
of
practical
deliberation
and
of
scientific
research
were
adopted
be
the
sole
genuine
logic
but
the
existence
of
thought
having
been
agreed
upon
we
have
in
this
applied
logic
only
an
incidental
inquiry
of
how
the
particular
resistances
and
oppositions
which
pure
thought
meets
from
particular
matters
may
best
be
discounted
it
is
concerned
with
methods
of
investigation
which
obviate
defects
in
the
relationship
of
thought
at
large
to
reality
at
large
as
these
present
themselves
under
the
limitations
of
human
experience
it
deals
merely
with
hindrances
and
with
devices
for
overcoming
them
it
is
directed
by
considerations
of
utility
when
we
reflect
that
this
field
includes
the
entire
procedure
of
practical
deliberation
and
of
concrete
scientific
research
we
begin
to
realize
something
of
the
significance
of
the
theory
of
logic
which
regards
the
limitations
of
specific
origination
and
specific
outcome
as
irrelevant
to
its
main
problem
which
assumes
an
activity
of
thought
pure
or
in
itself
that
is
irrespective
of
any
difference
in
its
objects
this
suggests
by
contrast
the
opposite
mode
of
stating
the
problem
of
logical
theory
generalization
of
the
nature
of
the
reflective
process
certainly
involves
elimination
of
much
of
the
specific
material
and
contents
of
the
of
daily
life
and
of
critical
science
quite
compatible
with
this
however
is
the
notion
that
it
seizes
upon
specific
conditions
and
factors
and
aims
to
bring
them
to
clear
consciousness
not
to
abolish
them
while
eliminating
the
particular
material
of
particular
practical
and
scientific
pursuits
it
may
strive
to
hit
upon
the
common
denominator
in
the
various
situations
which
are
antecedent
or
primary
to
thought
and
which
evoke
it
it
may
attempt
to
show
how
typical
features
in
the
specific
antecedents
of
thought
call
out
diverse
typical
modes
of
it
may
attempt
to
state
the
nature
of
the
specific
consequences
in
which
thought
fulfils
its
career
it
does
not
eliminate
dependence
upon
specific
occasions
as
provocative
of
thought
but
endeavors
to
define
in
the
various
occasions
renders
them
the
specific
occasion
is
not
eliminated
but
insisted
upon
and
brought
into
the
foreground
consequently
empirical
considerations
are
not
subsidiary
incidents
but
are
of
essential
importance
so
far
as
they
enable
us
to
trace
the
generation
of
the
from
this
point
of
view
the
various
types
and
modes
of
conceiving
judging
and
inference
are
treated
not
as
qualifications
of
thought
or
at
large
but
of
reflection
engaged
in
its
specific
most
economic
effective
response
to
its
own
particular
occasion
they
are
adaptations
for
control
of
stimuli
the
distinctions
and
classifications
that
have
been
accumulated
in
formal
logic
are
relevant
data
but
they
demand
interpretation
from
the
standpoint
of
use
as
organs
of
adjustment
to
material
antecedents
and
stimuli
finally
the
question
of
validity
or
ultimate
objective
of
thought
is
relevant
but
relevant
as
a
matter
of
the
specific
issue
of
the
specific
career
of
a
all
the
typical
investigatory
and
verificatory
procedures
of
the
various
sciences
indicate
the
ways
in
which
thought
actually
brings
to
successful
fulfilment
its
dealing
with
various
types
of
problems
while
the
epistemological
type
of
logic
may
as
we
have
seen
leave
under
the
name
of
applied
logic
a
subsidiary
place
open
for
the
instrumental
type
the
type
which
deals
with
thinking
as
a
specific
procedure
relative
to
a
specific
antecedent
occasion
and
to
a
subsequent
specific
fulfilment
is
not
able
to
reciprocate
the
favor
from
its
point
of
view
an
attempt
to
discuss
the
antecedents
data
forms
and
objectives
of
thought
apart
from
reference
to
particular
position
occupied
and
particular
part
played
in
the
growth
of
experience
is
to
reach
results
which
are
not
so
much
either
true
or
false
as
they
are
radically
meaningless
because
they
are
considered
apart
from
limits
its
results
are
not
only
abstractions
for
all
theorizing
ends
in
abstractions
but
abstractions
without
possible
reference
or
bearing
from
this
point
of
view
the
taking
of
something
whether
that
something
be
a
thinking
activity
its
empirical
stimulus
or
its
objective
goal
apart
from
the
limits
of
a
historic
or
developing
situation
is
the
essence
of
procedure
in
that
sense
of
metaphysics
which
makes
a
gulf
between
it
and
science
as
the
reader
has
doubtless
anticipated
it
is
the
object
of
this
chapter
to
present
the
problem
and
industry
of
reflective
thought
from
the
standpoint
of
na√Øve
experience
using
the
term
in
a
sense
wide
enough
to
cover
both
practical
procedure
and
concrete
scientific
research
i
resume
by
saying
that
this
point
of
view
knows
no
fixed
distinction
between
the
empirical
things
and
values
of
unreflective
life
and
the
most
abstract
process
of
rational
thought
it
knows
no
fixed
gulf
between
the
highest
flight
of
theory
and
a
control
of
the
details
of
practical
construction
and
behavior
it
passes
according
to
the
occasion
and
opportunity
of
the
moment
from
the
attitude
of
loving
and
struggling
and
doing
to
that
of
thinking
and
the
reverse
its
contents
or
material
shift
their
values
back
and
forth
from
technological
or
utilitarian
to
aesthetic
ethical
or
affectional
it
utilizes
data
of
perception
of
meaning
or
of
discursive
ideation
as
need
calls
just
as
an
inventor
now
utilizes
heat
now
mechanical
strain
now
electricity
according
to
the
demands
set
by
his
aim
anything
from
past
experience
may
be
taken
which
appears
to
be
an
element
in
either
the
statement
or
the
solution
of
the
present
problem
thus
we
understand
the
coexistence
without
contradiction
of
an
indeterminate
possible
field
and
a
limited
actual
field
the
undefined
range
of
possible
materials
becomes
specific
through
reference
to
an
end
in
all
this
there
is
no
difference
of
kind
between
the
methods
of
science
and
those
of
the
plain
man
the
difference
is
the
greater
control
by
science
of
the
statement
of
the
problem
and
of
the
selection
and
use
of
relevant
material
both
sensible
and
conceptual
the
two
are
related
to
each
other
just
as
the
inventions
of
uncivilized
man
stand
to
the
deliberate
and
consecutively
persistent
efforts
of
a
modern
inventor
to
produce
a
certain
complicated
device
for
doing
a
comprehensive
piece
of
work
neither
the
plain
man
nor
the
scientific
inquirer
is
aware
as
he
engages
in
his
reflective
activity
of
any
transition
from
one
sphere
of
existence
to
another
he
knows
no
two
fixed
worlds
reality
on
one
side
and
mere
subjective
ideas
on
the
other
he
is
aware
of
no
gulf
to
cross
he
assumes
uninterrupted
free
and
fluid
passage
from
ordinary
experience
to
abstract
thinking
from
thought
to
fact
from
things
to
theories
and
back
again
observation
passes
into
development
of
hypothesis
deductive
methods
pass
into
use
in
description
of
the
particular
inference
passes
into
action
all
with
no
sense
of
difficulty
save
those
found
in
the
particular
task
in
question
the
fundamental
assumption
is
this
does
not
mean
that
fact
is
confused
with
idea
or
observed
datum
with
voluntary
hypothesis
theory
with
doing
any
more
than
a
traveler
confuses
land
and
water
when
he
journeys
from
one
to
the
other
it
simply
means
that
each
is
placed
and
used
with
reference
to
service
rendered
the
other
and
with
reference
to
the
future
use
of
the
other
only
the
epistemological
spectator
of
traditional
controversies
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
everyday
man
and
the
scientific
man
in
this
free
and
easy
intercourse
are
rashly
assuming
the
right
to
glide
over
a
cleft
in
the
very
structure
of
reality
this
fact
raises
a
query
not
favorable
to
the
epistemologist
why
is
it
that
the
scientific
man
who
is
constantly
plying
his
venturous
traffic
of
exchange
of
facts
for
ideas
of
theories
for
laws
of
real
things
for
hypotheses
should
be
so
wholly
unaware
of
the
radical
and
generic
as
distinct
from
specific
difficulty
of
the
undertakings
in
which
he
is
engaged
we
thus
come
afresh
to
our
inquiry
does
not
the
epistemological
logician
unwittingly
transfer
the
specific
difficulty
which
always
faces
the
scientific
man
the
difficulty
in
detail
of
correct
and
adequate
translation
back
and
forth
of
set
of
facts
and
group
of
reflective
consideration
into
a
totally
different
problem
of
the
wholesale
relation
of
thought
at
large
to
reality
in
general
if
such
be
the
case
it
is
clear
that
the
very
way
in
which
the
epistemological
type
of
logic
states
the
problem
of
thinking
in
relation
both
to
empirical
antecedents
and
to
objective
truth
makes
that
problem
insoluble
working
terms
terms
which
as
working
are
flexible
and
historic
relative
and
methodological
are
transformed
into
absolute
fixed
and
predetermined
properties
of
being
we
come
a
little
closer
to
the
problem
when
we
recognize
that
every
scientific
inquiry
passes
historically
through
at
least
four
stages
the
first
of
these
stages
is
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
bull
that
in
which
scientific
inquiry
does
not
take
place
at
all
because
no
problem
or
difficulty
in
the
quality
of
the
experience
presents
itself
to
provoke
reflection
we
have
only
to
cast
our
eye
back
from
the
existing
status
of
any
science
or
back
from
the
status
of
any
particular
topic
in
any
science
to
discover
a
time
when
no
reflective
or
critical
thinking
busied
itself
with
the
matter
when
the
facts
and
relations
were
taken
for
granted
and
thus
were
lost
and
absorbed
in
the
net
meaning
which
accrued
from
the
experience
after
the
dawning
of
the
problem
there
comes
a
period
of
occupation
with
relatively
crude
and
unorganized
facts
hunting
for
locating
and
collecting
raw
material
this
is
the
empiric
stage
which
no
existing
science
however
proud
in
its
attained
rationality
can
disavow
as
its
own
progenitor
then
there
is
also
a
speculative
stage
a
period
of
guessing
of
making
hypotheses
of
framing
ideas
which
later
on
are
labeled
and
condemned
as
only
ideas
there
is
a
period
of
and
which
later
on
is
regarded
as
only
mentally
gymnastic
in
character
and
no
science
however
proud
in
its
present
security
of
experimental
assurance
can
disavow
a
scholastic
ancestor
finally
there
comes
a
period
of
fruitful
interaction
between
the
mere
ideas
and
the
mere
facts
a
period
when
observation
is
determined
by
experimental
conditions
depending
upon
the
use
of
certain
guiding
conceptions
when
reflection
is
directed
and
checked
at
every
point
by
the
use
of
experimental
data
and
by
the
necessity
of
finding
such
a
form
for
itself
as
will
enable
it
to
serve
in
a
deduction
leading
to
evolution
of
new
meanings
and
ultimately
to
experimental
inquiry
which
brings
to
light
new
facts
in
the
emerging
of
a
more
orderly
and
significant
region
of
fact
and
of
a
more
coherent
and
system
of
meaning
we
have
the
natural
limit
of
evolution
of
the
logic
of
a
given
science
but
consider
what
has
happened
in
this
historic
record
unanalyzed
experience
has
broken
up
into
distinctions
of
facts
and
ideas
the
factual
side
has
been
developed
by
indefinite
and
almost
miscellaneous
descriptions
and
cumulative
listings
the
conceptual
side
has
been
developed
by
unchecked
and
speculative
elaboration
of
definitions
classifications
etc
then
there
has
been
a
relegation
of
accepted
meanings
to
the
limbo
of
mere
ideas
there
has
been
a
passage
of
some
of
the
accepted
facts
into
the
region
of
mere
hypothesis
and
opinion
conversely
there
has
been
a
continued
issuing
of
ideas
from
the
region
of
hypotheses
and
theories
into
that
of
facts
of
accepted
objective
and
meaningful
objects
out
of
a
world
of
only
facts
and
of
only
ideas
there
emerges
a
world
continually
growing
in
definiteness
order
and
luminosity
this
progress
verified
in
every
record
of
science
is
an
absolute
monstrosity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
epistemology
which
assumes
a
thought
in
general
on
one
side
and
a
reality
in
general
on
the
other
the
reason
that
it
does
not
present
itself
as
such
a
monster
and
miracle
to
those
actually
concerned
with
it
is
because
of
reference
and
of
use
controls
all
diversities
in
the
modes
of
existence
specified
and
the
types
of
significance
assigned
the
distinction
of
meaning
and
fact
is
treated
in
the
growth
of
a
science
or
of
any
particular
scientific
problem
as
an
and
practical
division
of
labor
as
assignments
of
relative
position
with
reference
to
performance
of
a
task
as
deliberate
distribution
of
forces
at
command
for
their
more
economic
use
the
absorption
of
bald
fact
and
hypothetical
idea
into
the
formation
of
a
single
world
of
scientific
apprehension
and
comprehension
is
but
the
successful
achieving
of
the
aim
on
account
of
which
the
distinctions
in
question
were
instituted
thus
we
come
back
to
the
problem
of
logical
theory
to
take
the
distinctions
of
thought
and
fact
as
ontological
as
inherently
fixed
in
the
makeup
of
the
structure
of
being
results
in
treating
the
actual
technique
of
scientific
inquiry
and
scientific
control
as
a
mere
subsidiary
topic
ultimately
of
only
utilitarian
worth
it
also
states
the
terms
upon
which
thought
and
being
transact
business
in
a
way
so
totally
alien
to
concrete
experience
that
it
creates
a
problem
which
can
be
discussed
only
in
terms
of
itself
not
in
terms
of
the
conduct
of
life
as
against
this
the
logic
which
aligns
itself
with
the
origin
and
employ
of
reflective
thought
in
everyday
life
and
critical
science
follows
the
natural
history
of
thinking
as
a
having
its
own
generating
antecedents
and
stimuli
its
own
states
and
career
and
its
own
specific
objective
or
limit
this
point
of
view
makes
it
possible
for
logical
theory
to
come
to
terms
with
psychology
when
logic
is
considered
as
having
to
do
with
the
wholesale
activity
of
thought
the
question
of
the
historic
process
by
which
this
or
that
particular
thought
came
to
be
of
how
its
object
happens
to
present
itself
as
sensory
or
perceptual
or
conceptual
is
quite
irrelevant
these
things
are
mere
temporal
accidents
the
psychologist
not
lifting
his
gaze
from
the
realm
of
the
changeable
may
find
in
them
matters
of
interest
his
whole
industry
is
just
with
natural
history
to
trace
events
as
they
mutually
excite
and
inhibit
one
another
but
the
logician
we
are
told
has
a
deeper
problem
and
an
outlook
of
more
unbounded
horizon
he
deals
with
the
question
of
the
eternal
nature
of
thought
and
its
eternal
validity
in
relation
to
an
eternal
reality
he
is
concerned
not
with
genesis
but
with
value
not
with
a
historic
cycle
but
with
absolute
entities
and
relations
still
the
query
haunts
us
is
this
so
in
truth
or
has
the
logician
of
a
certain
type
arbitrarily
made
it
so
by
taking
his
terms
apart
from
reference
to
the
specific
occasions
in
which
they
arise
and
situations
in
which
they
function
if
the
latter
then
the
very
denial
of
historic
relationship
the
denial
of
the
significance
of
historic
method
is
indicative
of
the
unreal
character
of
his
own
abstraction
it
means
in
effect
that
the
affairs
under
consideration
have
been
isolated
from
the
conditions
in
which
alone
they
have
determinable
meaning
and
assignable
worth
it
is
astonishing
that
in
the
face
of
the
advance
of
the
evolutionary
method
in
natural
science
any
logician
can
persist
in
the
assertion
of
a
rigid
difference
between
the
problem
of
origin
and
of
nature
between
genesis
and
analysis
between
history
and
validity
such
assertion
simply
reiterates
as
final
a
distinction
which
grew
up
and
had
meaning
in
science
it
asserts
against
the
most
marked
advance
which
scientific
method
has
yet
made
a
survival
of
a
crude
period
of
logical
scientific
procedure
we
have
no
choice
save
either
to
conceive
of
thinking
as
a
response
to
a
specific
stimulus
or
else
to
regard
it
as
something
in
itself
having
just
in
and
of
itself
certain
traits
elements
and
laws
if
we
give
up
the
last
view
we
must
take
the
former
in
this
case
it
will
still
possess
distinctive
traits
but
they
will
be
traits
of
a
specific
response
to
a
specific
stimulus
the
significance
of
the
evolutionary
method
in
biology
and
social
history
is
that
every
distinct
organ
structure
or
formation
every
grouping
of
cells
or
elements
is
to
be
treated
as
an
instrument
of
adjustment
or
adaptation
to
a
particular
environing
situation
its
meaning
its
character
its
force
is
known
when
and
only
when
it
is
considered
as
an
arrangement
for
meeting
the
conditions
involved
in
some
specific
situation
this
analysis
is
carried
out
by
tracing
successive
stages
of
development
by
endeavoring
to
locate
the
particular
situation
in
which
each
structure
has
its
origin
and
by
tracing
the
successive
modifications
through
which
in
response
to
changing
media
it
has
reached
its
present
conformation
to
persist
in
condemning
natural
history
from
the
standpoint
of
what
natural
history
meant
before
it
identified
itself
with
an
evolutionary
process
is
not
so
much
to
exclude
the
standpoint
from
philosophic
consideration
as
it
is
to
evince
ignorance
of
what
it
signifies
psychology
as
the
natural
history
of
the
various
attitudes
and
structures
through
which
experiencing
passes
as
an
account
of
the
conditions
under
which
this
or
that
attitude
emerges
and
of
the
way
in
which
it
influences
by
stimulation
or
inhibition
production
of
other
states
or
conformations
of
reflection
is
indispensable
to
logical
evaluation
the
moment
we
treat
logical
theory
as
an
account
of
thinking
as
a
response
to
its
own
generating
conditions
and
consequently
judge
its
validity
by
reference
to
its
efficiency
in
meeting
its
problems
the
historical
point
of
view
describes
the
sequence
the
normative
follows
the
history
to
its
conclusion
and
then
turns
back
and
judges
each
historical
step
by
viewing
it
in
reference
to
its
own
outcome
in
the
course
of
changing
experience
we
keep
our
balance
in
moving
from
situations
of
an
affectional
quality
to
those
which
are
practical
or
appreciative
or
reflective
because
we
bear
constantly
in
mind
the
context
in
which
any
particular
distinction
presents
itself
as
we
submit
each
characteristic
function
and
situation
of
experience
to
our
gaze
we
find
it
has
a
dual
aspect
wherever
there
is
striving
there
are
obstacles
wherever
there
is
affection
there
are
persons
who
are
attached
wherever
there
is
doing
there
is
accomplishment
wherever
there
is
appreciation
there
is
value
wherever
there
is
thinking
there
is
we
keep
our
footing
as
we
move
from
one
attitude
to
another
from
one
characteristic
quality
to
another
because
of
the
position
occupied
in
the
whole
movement
by
the
particular
function
in
which
we
are
engaged
the
distinction
each
attitude
and
function
and
its
predecessor
and
successor
is
serial
dynamic
operative
the
distinctions
any
given
operation
or
function
are
structural
contemporaneous
and
distributive
thinking
follows
we
will
say
striving
and
doing
follows
thinking
each
in
the
fulfilment
of
its
own
function
inevitably
calls
out
its
successor
but
coincident
simultaneous
and
correspondent
doing
is
the
distinction
of
doer
and
of
deed
the
function
of
thought
of
thinking
and
material
thought
upon
within
the
function
of
striving
of
obstacle
and
aim
of
means
and
end
we
keep
our
paths
straight
because
we
do
not
confuse
the
sequential
and
functional
relationship
of
types
of
experience
with
the
contemporaneous
and
structural
distinctions
of
elements
within
a
given
function
in
the
seeming
maze
of
endless
confusion
and
unlimited
shiftings
we
find
our
way
by
the
means
of
the
stimulations
and
checks
occurring
within
the
process
in
which
we
are
actually
engaged
operating
within
empirical
situations
we
do
not
contrast
or
confuse
a
condition
which
is
an
element
in
the
formation
of
one
operation
with
the
status
which
is
one
of
the
distributive
terms
of
another
function
when
we
ignore
these
specific
empirical
clues
and
limitations
we
have
at
once
an
insoluble
because
meaningless
problem
upon
our
hands
now
the
epistemological
logician
deliberately
shuts
himself
off
from
those
cues
and
checks
upon
which
the
plain
man
instinctively
relies
and
which
the
scientific
man
deliberately
searches
for
and
adopts
as
constituting
his
technique
consequently
he
is
likely
to
set
the
attitude
which
has
place
and
significance
only
in
one
of
the
serial
functional
situations
of
experience
over
against
the
active
attitude
which
describes
part
of
the
structural
constitution
of
another
situation
or
with
equal
lack
of
justification
to
assimilate
materials
characteristic
of
different
stages
to
one
another
he
sets
the
agent
as
he
is
found
in
the
intimacy
of
love
or
appreciation
over
against
the
externality
of
the
fact
as
that
is
defined
within
the
reflective
process
he
takes
the
material
which
thought
selects
as
its
problematic
data
as
identical
with
the
significant
content
which
results
from
successful
pursuit
of
inquiry
and
this
in
turn
he
regards
as
the
material
which
was
presented
before
thinking
began
whose
peculiarities
were
the
means
of
awakening
thought
he
identifies
the
final
deposit
of
the
with
its
own
generating
antecedent
and
then
disposes
of
the
resulting
surd
by
reference
to
some
metaphysical
consideration
which
remains
when
logical
inquiry
when
science
as
interpreted
by
him
has
done
its
work
he
does
this
not
because
he
prefers
confusion
to
order
or
error
to
truth
but
simply
because
when
the
chain
of
historic
sequence
is
cut
the
vessel
of
thought
is
afloat
to
veer
upon
a
sea
without
soundings
or
moorings
there
are
but
two
alternatives
either
there
is
an
object
in
itself
of
mind
in
itself
or
else
there
are
a
series
of
situations
where
elements
vary
with
the
varying
functions
to
which
they
belong
if
the
latter
the
only
way
in
which
the
characteristic
terms
of
situations
can
be
defined
is
by
discriminating
the
functions
to
which
they
belong
and
the
epistemological
logician
in
choosing
to
take
his
question
as
one
of
thought
which
has
its
own
form
just
as
thought
apart
from
the
limits
of
the
special
work
it
has
to
do
has
deprived
himself
of
these
supports
and
stays
the
problem
of
logic
has
a
more
general
and
a
more
specific
phase
in
its
generic
form
it
deals
with
this
question
how
does
one
type
of
functional
situation
and
attitude
in
experience
pass
out
of
and
into
another
for
example
the
technological
or
utilitarian
into
the
aesthetic
the
aesthetic
into
the
religious
the
religious
into
the
scientific
and
this
into
the
and
so
on
the
more
specific
question
is
how
does
the
particular
functional
situation
termed
the
reflective
behave
how
shall
we
describe
it
what
in
detail
are
its
diverse
contemporaneous
distinctions
or
divisions
of
labor
its
correspondent
in
what
specific
ways
do
these
operate
with
reference
to
each
other
so
as
to
effect
the
specific
aim
which
is
proposed
by
the
needs
of
the
affair
this
chapter
may
be
brought
to
conclusion
by
reference
to
the
more
ultimate
value
of
the
logic
of
experience
of
logic
taken
in
its
wider
sense
that
is
as
an
account
of
the
sequence
of
the
various
typical
functions
or
situations
of
experience
in
their
determining
relations
to
one
another
philosophy
defined
as
such
a
logic
makes
no
pretense
to
be
an
account
of
a
closed
and
finished
universe
its
business
is
not
to
secure
or
guarantee
any
particular
reality
or
value
it
gets
the
significance
of
a
method
the
right
relationship
and
adjustment
of
the
various
typical
phases
of
experience
to
one
another
is
a
problem
felt
in
every
department
of
life
intellectual
rectification
and
control
of
these
adjustments
can
not
fail
to
reflect
itself
in
an
added
clearness
and
security
on
the
practical
side
it
may
be
that
general
logic
can
not
become
an
instrument
in
the
immediate
direction
of
the
activities
of
science
or
art
or
industry
but
it
is
of
value
in
criticizing
and
organizing
tools
of
immediate
research
it
also
has
direct
significance
in
the
valuation
for
social
or
of
results
achieved
in
particular
branches
much
of
the
immediate
business
of
life
is
badly
done
because
we
do
not
know
the
genesis
and
outcome
of
the
work
that
occupies
us
the
manner
and
degree
of
appropriation
of
the
goods
achieved
in
various
departments
of
social
interest
and
vocation
are
partial
and
faulty
because
we
are
not
clear
as
to
the
due
rights
and
responsibilities
of
one
function
of
experience
in
reference
to
others
the
value
of
research
for
social
progress
the
bearing
of
psychology
upon
educational
procedure
the
mutual
relations
of
fine
and
industrial
art
the
question
of
the
extent
and
nature
of
specialization
in
science
in
comparison
with
the
claims
of
applied
science
the
adjustment
of
religious
aspirations
to
scientific
statements
the
justification
of
a
refined
culture
for
a
few
in
face
of
economic
insufficiency
for
the
mass
the
relation
of
organization
to
individuality
such
are
a
few
of
the
many
social
questions
whose
answer
depends
upon
the
possession
and
use
of
a
general
logic
of
experience
as
a
method
of
inquiry
and
interpretation
i
do
not
say
that
headway
can
not
be
made
in
such
questions
apart
from
the
method
indicated
a
logic
of
experience
but
unless
we
have
a
critical
and
assured
view
of
the
juncture
in
which
and
with
reference
to
which
a
given
attitude
or
interest
arises
unless
we
know
the
service
it
is
thereby
called
upon
to
perform
and
hence
the
organs
or
methods
by
which
it
best
functions
in
that
service
our
progress
is
impeded
and
irregular
we
take
a
part
for
a
whole
a
means
for
an
end
or
we
attack
wholesale
some
interest
because
it
interferes
with
the
deified
sway
of
the
one
we
have
selected
as
ultimate
a
clear
and
comprehensive
consensus
of
social
conviction
and
a
consequent
concentrated
and
economical
direction
of
effort
are
assured
only
as
there
is
some
way
of
locating
the
position
and
r√¥le
of
each
typical
interest
and
occupation
the
domain
of
opinion
is
one
of
conflict
its
rule
is
arbitrary
and
costly
only
intellectual
method
affords
a
substitute
for
opinion
a
general
logic
of
experience
alone
can
do
for
social
qualities
and
aims
what
the
natural
sciences
after
centuries
of
struggle
are
doing
for
activity
in
the
physical
realm
this
does
not
mean
that
systems
of
philosophy
which
have
attempted
to
state
the
nature
of
thought
and
of
reality
at
large
apart
from
limits
of
particular
situations
in
the
movement
of
experience
have
been
worthless
though
it
does
mean
that
their
industry
has
been
somewhat
misapplied
the
unfolding
of
metaphysical
theory
has
made
large
contributions
to
positive
evaluations
of
the
typical
situations
and
relationships
of
experience
even
when
its
conscious
intention
has
been
quite
otherwise
every
system
of
philosophy
is
itself
a
mode
of
reflection
consequently
if
our
main
contention
be
true
it
too
has
been
evoked
out
of
specific
social
antecedents
and
has
had
its
use
as
a
response
to
them
it
has
effected
something
in
modifying
the
situation
within
which
it
found
its
origin
it
may
not
have
solved
the
problem
which
it
consciously
put
itself
in
many
cases
we
may
freely
admit
that
the
question
put
has
been
found
afterward
to
be
so
wrongly
put
as
to
be
insoluble
yet
exactly
the
same
thing
is
true
in
precisely
the
same
sense
in
the
history
of
science
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
it
is
impossible
for
the
scientific
man
to
cast
the
first
stone
at
the
philosopher
the
progress
of
science
in
any
branch
continually
brings
with
it
a
realization
that
problems
in
their
previous
form
of
statement
are
insoluble
because
put
in
terms
of
unreal
conditions
because
the
real
conditions
have
been
mixed
up
with
mental
artifacts
or
misconstructions
every
science
is
continually
learning
that
its
supposed
solutions
are
only
apparent
because
the
solution
solves
not
the
actual
problem
but
one
which
has
been
made
up
but
the
very
putting
of
the
question
the
very
giving
of
the
wrong
answer
induces
modification
of
existing
intellectual
habits
standpoints
and
aims
wrestling
with
the
problem
there
is
evolution
of
new
technique
to
control
inquiry
there
is
search
for
new
facts
institution
of
new
types
of
experimentation
there
is
gain
in
the
methodic
control
of
experience
and
all
this
is
progress
it
is
only
the
cynic
the
sensualist
and
the
fanatical
dogmatist
who
interpret
the
continuous
change
of
science
as
proving
that
since
each
successive
statement
is
wrong
the
whole
record
is
error
and
folly
and
that
the
present
truth
is
only
the
error
not
yet
found
out
such
draw
the
moral
of
caring
naught
for
all
these
things
or
of
flying
to
some
external
authority
which
will
deliver
once
for
all
the
fixed
and
unchangeable
truth
but
historic
philosophy
even
in
its
aberrant
forms
has
proved
a
factor
in
the
valuation
of
experience
it
has
brought
problems
to
light
it
has
provoked
intellectual
conflicts
without
which
values
are
only
nominal
even
through
its
absolutistic
isolations
it
has
secured
recognition
of
mutual
dependencies
and
reciprocal
reinforcements
yet
if
it
can
define
its
work
more
clearly
it
can
concentrate
its
energy
upon
its
own
characteristic
problem
the
genesis
and
functioning
in
experience
of
various
typical
interests
and
occupations
with
reference
to
one
another

the
antecedents
and
stimuli
of
thinking
we
have
discriminated
logic
in
its
wider
sense
concerned
with
the
sequence
of
characteristic
functions
and
attitudes
in
experience
from
logic
in
its
stricter
meaning
concerned
with
the
function
of
reflective
thought
we
must
avoid
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
identifying
logic
with
either
of
these
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
or
of
supposing
that
it
is
possible
to
isolate
one
finally
from
the
other
the
more
detailed
treatment
of
the
organs
and
methods
of
reflection
can
not
be
carried
on
with
security
save
as
we
have
a
correct
idea
of
the
position
of
reflection
amid
the
typical
functions
of
experience
yet
it
is
impossible
to
determine
this
larger
placing
save
as
we
have
a
defined
and
analytic
as
distinct
from
a
merely
vague
and
gross
view
of
what
we
mean
by
reflection
what
is
its
actual
constitution
it
is
necessary
to
work
back
and
forth
between
the
larger
and
the
narrower
fields
transforming
every
increment
upon
one
side
into
a
method
of
work
upon
the
other
and
thereby
testing
it
the
evident
confusion
of
existing
logical
theory
its
uncertainty
as
to
its
own
bounds
and
limits
its
tendency
to
oscillate
from
larger
questions
of
the
meaning
of
judgment
and
the
validity
of
inference
over
to
details
of
scientific
technique
and
to
translate
distinctions
of
formal
logic
into
acts
in
an
investigatory
or
verificatory
process
are
indications
of
the
need
of
this
double
movement
in
the
next
three
chapters
it
is
proposed
to
take
up
some
of
the
considerations
that
lie
on
the
borderland
between
the
larger
and
the
narrower
conceptions
of
logical
theory
i
shall
discuss
the
of
the
function
of
thought
in
experience
so
far
as
such
enables
us
to
characterize
some
of
the
most
fundamental
distinctions
or
divisions
of
labor
within
the
reflective
process
in
taking
up
the
problem
of
the
of
thought
i
shall
try
to
make
clear
that
it
assumes
three
quite
distinct
forms
according
to
the
epochal
moment
reached
in
control
of
experience
i
shall
attempt
to
show
that
we
must
consider
from
the
standpoint
first
of
the
or
conditions
that
evoke
thought
secondly
of
the
or
presented
to
thought
and
thirdly
of
the
of
thought
of
these
three
distinctions
the
first
that
of
antecedent
and
stimulus
clearly
refers
to
the
situation
that
is
immediately
prior
to
the
as
such
the
second
that
of
datum
or
immediately
given
matter
refers
to
a
distinction
which
is
made
within
the
as
a
part
of
and
for
the
sake
of
its
own
it
is
a
status
in
the
scheme
of
thinking
the
third
that
of
content
or
object
refers
to
the
progress
actually
made
in
any
material
which
is
organized
by
inquiry
so
far
as
inquiry
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
this
chapter
will
get
at
the
matter
of
preliminary
conditions
of
thought
indirectly
rather
than
directly
by
indicating
the
contradictory
positions
into
which
one
of
the
most
vigorous
and
acute
of
modern
logicians
lotze
has
been
forced
through
failing
to
define
logical
distinctions
in
terms
of
the
history
of
readjustment
and
control
of
things
in
experience
and
being
thereby
compelled
to
interpret
certain
notions
as
absolute
instead
of
as
historic
and
methodological
before
passing
directly
to
the
exposition
and
criticism
of
lotze
it
will
be
well
however
to
take
the
matter
in
a
somewhat
freer
way
we
can
not
approach
logical
inquiry
in
a
wholly
direct
and
uncompromised
manner
of
necessity
we
bring
to
it
certain
distinctions
distinctions
partly
the
outcome
of
concrete
experience
partly
due
to
the
logical
theory
which
has
got
embodied
in
ordinary
language
and
in
current
intellectual
habits
partly
results
of
deliberate
scientific
and
philosophic
inquiry
these
more
or
less
results
are
resources
they
are
the
only
weapons
with
which
we
can
attack
the
new
problem
yet
they
are
full
of
unexamined
assumptions
they
commit
us
to
all
sorts
of
logically
predetermined
conclusions
in
one
sense
our
study
of
the
new
let
us
say
logical
theory
is
in
truth
only
a
review
a
retesting
and
criticizing
of
the
intellectual
standpoints
and
methods
which
we
bring
with
us
to
the
study
nowadays
everyone
comes
with
certain
distinctions
already
made
between
the
subjective
and
the
objective
between
the
physical
and
the
mental
between
the
intellectual
and
the
factual
we
have
learned
to
regard
the
region
of
emotional
disturbance
of
uncertainty
and
aspiration
as
belonging
peculiarly
to
ourselves
we
have
learned
to
set
over
against
this
the
world
of
observation
and
of
valid
thought
as
something
unaffected
by
our
moods
hopes
fears
and
opinions
we
have
also
come
to
distinguish
between
what
is
immediately
present
in
our
experience
and
the
past
and
the
future
we
contrast
the
realms
of
memory
and
anticipation
with
that
of
sense
perception
more
generally
we
contrast
the
given
with
the
inferential
we
are
confirmed
in
a
habit
of
distinguishing
between
what
we
call
actual
fact
and
our
mental
attitude
toward
that
fact
the
attitude
of
surmise
or
wonder
or
reflective
investigation
while
one
of
the
aims
of
logical
theory
is
precisely
to
make
us
critically
conscious
of
the
significance
and
bearing
of
these
various
distinctions
to
change
them
from
assumptions
into
controlled
conceptions
our
mental
habits
are
so
set
that
they
tend
to
have
their
own
way
with
us
we
read
into
logical
theory
conceptions
that
were
formed
before
we
had
even
dreamed
of
the
logical
undertaking
which
after
all
has
for
its
business
to
assign
to
the
terms
in
question
their
proper
meaning
our
conclusions
are
thus
controlled
by
the
very
notions
which
need
criticism
and
revision
we
find
in
lotze
an
unusually
explicit
inventory
of
these
various
preliminary
distinctions
and
an
unusually
serious
effort
to
deal
with
the
problems
which
arise
from
introducing
them
into
the
structure
of
logical
theory
he
expressly
separates
the
matter
of
logical
worth
from
that
of
psychological
genesis
he
consequently
abstracts
the
of
logic
as
such
wholly
from
the
question
of
historic
and
he
agrees
with
in
holding
that
logical
thought
is
reflective
and
thus
presupposes
a
given
material
he
occupies
himself
with
the
nature
of
the
antecedent
conditions
he
wrestles
with
the
problem
of
how
a
material
formed
prior
to
thought
and
irrespective
of
it
can
yet
afford
stuff
upon
which
thought
may
exercise
itself
he
expressly
raises
the
question
of
how
thought
working
independently
and
from
without
upon
a
foreign
material
can
shape
the
latter
into
results
which
are
valid
that
is
objective
if
this
discussion
is
successful
if
lotze
can
provide
the
intermediaries
which
span
the
gulf
between
the
exercise
of
logical
functions
by
thought
upon
a
material
wholly
external
to
it
if
he
can
show
that
the
question
of
the
origin
of
of
thought
and
of
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
its
meaning
and
validity
we
shall
have
to
surrender
the
position
already
taken
but
if
we
find
that
lotze
elaborations
only
elaborate
the
fundamental
difficulty
presenting
it
now
in
this
light
and
now
in
that
but
always
presenting
the
problem
as
if
it
were
its
own
solution
we
shall
be
confirmed
in
our
idea
of
the
need
of
considering
logical
questions
from
a
different
point
of
view
if
we
find
that
whatever
his
formal
treatment
he
always
as
a
matter
of
fact
falls
back
upon
some
organized
situation
or
function
as
the
source
of
both
the
material
and
the
process
of
inquiry
we
shall
have
in
so
far
an
elucidation
and
even
a
corroboration
of
our
theory
we
begin
with
the
question
of
the
material
antecedents
of
thought
antecedents
which
condition
reflection
and
which
call
it
out
as
reaction
or
response
by
giving
its
cue
lotze
differs
from
many
logicians
of
the
same
type
in
furnishing
an
explicit
account
of
these
antecedents
the
ultimate
material
antecedents
of
thought
are
found
in
impressions
which
are
due
to
external
objects
as
stimuli
taken
in
themselves
these
impressions
are
mere
psychical
states
or
events
they
exist
in
us
side
by
side
or
one
after
the
other
according
as
the
objects
which
excite
them
operate
simultaneously
or
successively
the
occurrence
of
these
various
psychical
states
is
not
however
entirely
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
the
exciting
thing
after
a
state
has
once
been
excited
it
gets
the
power
of
reawakening
other
states
which
have
accompanied
it
or
followed
it
the
associative
mechanism
of
revival
plays
a
part
if
we
had
a
complete
knowledge
of
both
the
stimulating
object
and
its
effects
and
of
the
details
of
the
associative
mechanism
we
should
be
able
from
given
data
to
predict
the
whole
course
of
any
given
train
or
current
of
ideas
for
the
impressions
as
conjoined
simultaneously
or
successively
become
ideas
and
a
current
of
ideas
taken
in
itself
a
sensation
or
impression
is
nothing
but
a
state
of
our
consciousness
a
mood
of
ourselves
any
given
current
of
ideas
is
a
necessary
sequence
of
existences
just
as
necessary
as
any
succession
of
material
events
happening
in
some
particular
sensitive
soul
or
organism
just
because
under
their
respective
conditions
every
such
series
of
ideas
hangs
together
by
the
same
necessity
and
law
as
every
other
there
would
be
no
ground
for
making
any
such
distinction
of
value
as
that
between
truth
and
untruth
thus
placing
one
group
in
opposition
to
all
the
others
thus
far
as
the
last
quotation
clearly
indicates
there
is
no
question
of
reflective
thought
and
hence
no
question
of
logical
theory
but
further
examination
reveals
a
peculiar
property
of
the
current
of
ideas
some
ideas
are
merely
coincident
while
others
may
be
termed
coherent
that
is
to
say
the
exciting
causes
of
some
of
our
simultaneous
and
successive
ideas
really
belong
together
while
in
other
cases
they
simply
happen
to
act
at
the
same
time
without
there
being
a
real
connection
between
them
by
the
associative
mechanism
however
both
the
coherent
and
the
merely
coincident
combinations
recur
the
first
type
of
recurrence
supplies
positive
material
for
knowledge
the
second
gives
occasion
for
error
it
is
a
peculiar
mixture
of
the
coincident
and
the
coherent
which
sets
the
peculiar
problem
of
reflective
thought
the
business
of
thought
is
to
recover
and
confirm
the
coherent
the
really
connected
adding
to
its
reinstatement
an
accessory
justifying
notion
of
the
real
ground
of
coherence
while
it
eliminates
the
coincident
as
such
while
the
mere
current
of
ideas
is
something
which
just
happens
within
us
the
process
of
elimination
and
of
confirmation
by
means
of
statement
of
real
ground
and
basis
of
connection
is
an
activity
which
mind
as
such
exercises
this
distinction
marks
off
thought
as
activity
from
any
psychical
event
and
from
the
associative
mechanism
as
mere
happenings
one
is
concerned
with
mere
coexistences
and
sequences
the
other
with
the
cognitive
of
these
combinations
consideration
of
the
peculiar
work
of
thought
in
going
over
sorting
out
and
determining
various
ideas
according
to
a
standard
of
value
will
occupy
us
in
our
next
chapter
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
material
antecedents
of
thought
as
they
are
described
by
lotze
at
first
glance
he
seems
to
propound
a
satisfactory
theory
he
avoids
the
extravagancies
of
transcendental
logic
which
assumes
that
all
the
matter
of
experience
is
determined
from
the
very
start
by
rational
thought
and
he
also
avoids
the
pitfall
of
purely
empirical
logic
which
makes
no
distinction
between
the
mere
occurrence
and
association
of
ideas
and
the
real
worth
and
validity
of
the
various
conjunctions
thus
produced
he
allows
unreflective
experience
defined
in
terms
of
sensations
and
their
combinations
to
provide
material
conditions
for
thinking
while
he
reserves
for
thought
a
distinctive
work
and
dignity
of
its
own
sense
experience
furnishes
the
antecedents
thought
has
to
introduce
and
develop
systematic
connection
rationality
a
further
analysis
of
lotze
treatment
may
however
lead
us
to
believe
that
his
statement
is
riddled
through
and
through
with
inconsistencies
and
that
indeed
any
one
part
of
it
can
be
maintained
only
by
the
denial
of
some
other
portion
the
impression
is
the
ultimate
antecedent
in
its
purest
or
crudest
form
according
to
the
angle
from
which
one
views
it
it
is
that
which
has
never
felt
for
good
or
for
bad
the
influence
of
thought
combined
into
ideas
these
impressions
stimulate
or
arouse
the
activities
of
thought
which
are
forthwith
directed
upon
them
as
the
recipient
of
the
activity
which
they
have
excited
and
brought
to
bear
upon
themselves
they
furnish
also
the
material
content
of
thought
its
actual
stuff
as
lotze
says
over
and
over
again
it
is
the
relations
themselves
already
subsisting
between
impressions
when
we
become
conscious
of
them
by
which
the
action
of
thought
which
is
never
anything
but
reaction
is
attracted
and
this
action
consists
merely
in
interpreting
relations
which
we
find
existing
between
our
passive
impressions
into
aspects
of
the
matter
of
impressions
and
again
thought
can
make
no
difference
where
it
finds
none
already
in
the
matter
of
the
impressions
and
again
the
possibility
and
the
success
of
thought
procedure
depends
upon
this
original
constitution
and
organization
of
the
whole
world
of
ideas
a
constitution
which
though
not
necessary
in
thought
is
all
the
more
necessary
to
make
thinking
possible
the
impressions
and
ideas
thus
play
a
versatile
r√¥le
they
now
assume
the
part
of
ultimate
antecedents
and
provocative
conditions
of
crude
material
and
somehow
when
arranged
of
content
for
thought
this
very
versatility
awakens
suspicion
while
the
impression
is
merely
subjective
and
a
bare
state
of
our
own
consciousness
yet
it
is
determined
both
as
to
its
existence
and
as
to
its
relation
to
other
similar
existences
by
external
objects
as
stimuli
if
not
as
causes
it
is
also
determined
by
a
psychical
mechanism
so
thoroughly
objective
or
regular
in
its
workings
as
to
give
the
same
necessary
character
to
the
current
of
ideas
that
is
possessed
by
any
physical
sequence
thus
that
which
is
nothing
but
a
state
of
our
consciousness
turns
out
straightway
to
be
a
specifically
determined
objective
fact
in
a
system
of
facts
that
this
absolute
transformation
is
a
contradiction
is
no
clearer
than
that
just
such
a
contradiction
is
indispensable
to
lotze
if
impressions
were
nothing
but
states
of
consciousness
moods
of
ourselves
bare
psychical
existences
it
is
sure
enough
that
we
should
never
even
know
them
to
be
such
to
say
nothing
of
conserving
them
as
adequate
conditions
and
material
for
thought
it
is
only
by
treating
them
as
real
facts
in
a
real
world
and
only
by
carrying
over
into
them
in
some
assumed
and
unexplained
way
the
capacity
of
representing
the
cosmic
facts
which
cause
them
that
impressions
or
ideas
come
in
any
sense
within
the
scope
of
thought
but
if
the
antecedents
are
really
then
lotze
whole
way
of
distinguishing
from
existence
or
event
without
objective
significance
must
be
radically
modified
the
implication
that
impressions
have
actually
a
quality
or
meaning
of
their
own
becomes
explicit
when
we
refer
to
lotze
theory
that
the
immediate
antecedent
of
thought
is
found
in
the
of
ideas
when
thought
is
said
to
take
cognizance
of
which
its
own
activity
does
not
originate
but
which
have
been
prepared
for
it
by
the
unconscious
mechanism
of
the
psychic
states
the
attribution
of
objective
content
of
reference
and
meaning
to
ideas
is
unambiguous
the
idea
forms
a
most
convenient
halfway
house
for
lotze
on
one
hand
as
absolutely
prior
to
thought
as
material
antecedent
condition
it
is
merely
psychical
bald
subjective
event
but
as
for
thought
as
antecedent
which
affords
stuff
for
thought
exercise
it
characteristically
qualifies
content
although
we
have
been
told
that
the
impression
is
a
mere
receptive
irritation
without
participation
of
mental
activity
we
are
not
surprised
in
view
of
this
capacity
of
ideas
to
learn
that
the
mind
actually
has
a
determining
share
in
both
the
reception
of
stimuli
and
in
their
further
associative
combinations
the
subject
always
enters
into
the
presentation
of
any
mental
object
even
the
sensational
to
say
nothing
of
the
perceptional
and
the
imaged
the
perception
of
a
given
state
of
things
is
possible
only
on
the
assumption
that
the
perceiving
subject
is
at
once
enabled
and
compelled
by
its
own
nature
to
combine
the
excitations
which
reach
it
from
objects
into
those
forms
which
it
is
to
perceive
in
the
objects
and
which
it
supposes
itself
simply
to
from
them
it
is
only
by
continual
transition
from
impression
and
ideas
as
mental
states
and
events
to
ideas
as
logical
or
that
lotze
bridges
the
gulf
from
bare
exciting
antecedent
to
concrete
material
conditions
of
thought
this
contradiction
again
is
necessary
to
lotze
standpoint
to
set
out
frankly
with
objects
as
antecedents
would
demand
reconsideration
of
the
whole
viewpoint
which
supposes
that
the
difference
between
the
logical
and
its
antecedent
is
a
matter
of
the
difference
between
and
mere
or
it
would
indicate
that
since
meaning
or
value
is
already
there
the
task
of
thought
must
be
that
of
the
transformation
or
of
through
an
intermediary
process
on
the
other
hand
to
stick
by
the
standpoint
of
existence
is
not
to
get
anything
which
can
be
called
even
antecedent
of
thought
why
is
there
a
task
of
transformation
consideration
of
the
material
in
its
function
of
evoking
thought
giving
it
its
cue
will
serve
to
complete
the
picture
of
the
contradiction
and
of
the
real
facts
it
is
the
conflict
between
ideas
as
merely
coincident
and
ideas
as
coherent
which
constitutes
the
need
that
provokes
the
response
of
thought
here
lotze
vibrates
between
considering
both
coincidence
and
coherence
as
psychical
events
considering
coincidence
as
purely
psychical
and
coherence
as
at
least
and
making
them
both
determinations
within
the
sphere
of
reflective
thought
in
strict
accordance
with
his
own
premises
coincidence
and
coherence
ought
both
to
be
mere
peculiarities
of
the
current
of
ideas
as
events
within
ourselves
but
so
taken
the
distinction
becomes
absolutely
meaningless
events
do
not
cohere
at
the
most
certain
sets
of
them
happen
more
or
less
frequently
than
other
sets
the
only
intelligible
difference
is
one
of
frequency
of
coincidence
and
even
this
attributes
to
an
event
the
supernatural
trait
of
reappearing
after
it
has
disappeared
even
coincidence
has
to
be
defined
in
terms
of
relation
of
the
which
are
supposed
to
excite
the
psychical
events
that
happen
together
as
recent
psychological
discussion
has
made
clear
enough
it
is
the
matter
meaning
or
content
of
ideas
that
is
associated
not
the
ideas
as
states
or
existences
take
such
an
idea
as
we
may
it
means
the
conjunction
of
various
sense
impressions
but
it
is
connection
or
mutual
reference
of
that
we
have
in
mind
in
the
assertion
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
our
psychical
image
of
the
sun
is
not
psychically
engaged
in
revolving
about
our
psychical
image
of
the
earth
it
would
be
amusing
if
such
were
the
case
theaters
and
all
dramatic
representations
would
be
at
a
discount
but
in
truth
is
a
single
meaning
or
intellectual
object
it
is
a
unified
within
which
certain
distinctions
of
reference
appear
it
is
concerned
with
what
we
intend
when
we
think
earth
and
sun
and
think
them
in
their
relation
to
each
other
it
is
a
rule
specification
or
direction
of
how
to
think
when
we
have
occasion
to
think
a
certain
to
treat
this
mutual
reference
as
if
it
were
simply
a
case
of
conjunction
of
mental
events
produced
by
irritation
and
association
is
a
profound
case
of
the
psychological
fallacy
we
may
indeed
analyze
an
experience
involving
belief
in
an
object
of
a
certain
kind
and
find
that
it
had
its
origin
in
certain
conditions
of
the
sensitive
organism
in
certain
peculiarities
of
perception
and
of
association
and
hence
conclude
that
the
belief
involved
in
it
was
not
justified
by
the
facts
themselves
but
the
significance
of
the
belief
in
by
those
who
held
it
consisted
precisely
in
the
fact
that
it
was
taken
not
as
a
mere
association
of
feelings
but
as
a
definite
portion
of
the
whole
structure
of
objective
experience
guaranteed
by
other
parts
of
the
fabric
and
lending
its
support
and
giving
its
tone
to
them
it
was
to
them
part
of
the
experienced
frame
of
things
of
the
real
world
put
the
other
way
if
such
an
instance
meant
a
mere
conjunction
of
psychical
states
there
would
be
in
it
absolutely
nothing
to
evoke
thought
each
idea
as
event
as
lotze
himself
points
out
i
may
be
regarded
as
adequately
and
necessarily
determined
to
the
place
it
occupies
there
is
absolutely
no
question
on
the
side
of
events
of
mere
coincidence
genuine
connection
as
event
it
is
there
and
it
belongs
there
we
can
not
treat
something
as
at
once
a
bare
fact
of
existence
and
a
problematic
of
logical
inquiry
to
take
the
reflective
point
of
view
is
to
consider
the
matter
in
a
totally
new
light
as
lotze
says
it
is
to
raise
the
question
of
rightful
claims
to
a
position
or
relation
the
point
becomes
clearer
when
we
contrast
coincidence
with
connection
to
consider
coincidence
as
simply
psychical
and
coherence
as
at
least
is
to
put
the
two
on
such
different
bases
that
no
question
of
contrasting
them
can
arise
the
coincidence
which
precedes
a
valid
or
grounded
coherence
the
conjunction
which
as
coexistence
of
objects
and
sequence
of
acts
is
perfectly
adequate
never
is
as
antecedent
the
coincidence
which
is
set
over
against
coherence
the
of
books
on
my
bookshelf
the
succession
of
noises
that
rise
through
my
window
do
not
trouble
me
logically
they
do
not
appear
as
errors
or
even
as
problems
one
coexistence
is
just
as
good
as
any
other
until
some
new
point
of
view
or
new
end
presents
itself
if
it
is
a
question
of
the
convenience
of
arrangement
of
books
then
the
value
of
their
present
collocation
becomes
a
problem
then
i
contrast
their
present
state
as
bare
conjunction
over
against
another
scheme
as
one
which
is
coherent
if
i
regard
the
sequence
of
noises
as
a
case
of
articulate
speech
their
order
becomes
important
it
is
a
problem
to
be
determined
the
inquiry
whether
a
given
combination
presents
apparent
or
real
connection
shows
that
reflective
inquiry
is
already
going
on
does
this
phase
of
the
moon
really
mean
rain
or
does
it
just
happen
that
the
comes
when
the
moon
has
reached
this
phase
to
ask
such
questions
shows
that
a
certain
portion
of
the
universe
of
objective
experience
is
subjected
to
critical
analysis
for
purposes
of
definitive
restatement
the
tendency
to
regard
some
combination
as
mere
coincidence
is
absolutely
a
of
the
movement
of
mind
in
its
search
for
the
real
connection
if
coexistence
as
such
is
to
be
set
against
coherence
as
such
as
the
against
the
logical
then
since
our
whole
spatial
universe
is
one
of
collocation
and
since
thought
in
this
universe
can
never
get
farther
than
substituting
one
collocation
for
another
the
whole
realm
of
is
condemned
offhand
and
in
perpetuity
to
but
in
truth
coincidence
as
over
against
coherence
conjunction
as
over
against
connection
is
just
coherence
one
which
is
under
the
fire
of
active
inquiry
the
distinction
is
one
which
arises
only
within
the
logical
or
reflective
function
this
brings
us
explicitly
to
the
fact
that
there
is
neither
coincidence
nor
coherence
in
terms
of
the
elements
or
meanings
contained
in
any
couple
or
pair
of
ideas
taken
by
itself
it
is
only
when
they
are
in
a
situation
or
function
which
includes
more
than
either
the
coincident
or
the
coherent
and
more
than
the
arithmetical
sum
of
the
two
that
thought
activity
can
be
evoked
lotze
is
continually
in
this
dilemma
thought
either
shapes
its
own
material
or
else
just
accepts
it
in
the
first
case
since
lotze
can
not
rid
himself
of
the
presumption
that
thought
must
have
a
fixed
antecedent
its
activity
can
only
alter
this
stuff
and
thus
lead
the
mind
farther
away
from
reality
but
if
thought
just
accepts
its
material
how
can
there
be
any
distinctive
aim
or
activity
of
thought
at
all
as
we
have
seen
lotze
endeavors
to
escape
this
dilemma
by
supposing
that
while
thought
receives
its
material
yet
checks
it
up
it
eliminates
certain
portions
of
it
and
reinstates
others
plus
the
stamp
and
seal
of
its
own
validity
lotze
objects
most
strenuously
to
the
kantian
notion
that
thought
awaits
its
with
certain
modes
of
apprehension
this
notion
would
raise
the
insoluble
question
of
how
thought
contrives
to
bring
the
matter
of
each
impression
under
that
particular
form
which
is
appropriate
to
it
i
but
he
has
not
avoided
the
difficulty
how
does
thought
know
which
of
the
combinations
are
merely
coincident
and
which
are
merely
coherent
how
does
it
know
which
to
eliminate
as
irrelevant
and
which
to
confirm
as
grounded
either
this
evaluation
is
an
imposition
of
its
own
or
else
gets
its
cue
and
clue
from
the
now
if
the
coincident
and
the
coherent
taken
in
and
of
themselves
are
competent
to
give
this
direction
they
are
already
labeled
the
further
work
of
thought
is
one
of
supererogation
it
has
at
most
barely
to
note
and
seal
the
material
combinations
that
are
already
there
such
a
view
clearly
renders
thought
work
as
unnecessary
in
form
as
it
is
futile
in
force
but
there
is
no
alternative
except
to
recognize
that
an
entire
situation
or
environment
within
which
exist
both
that
which
is
afterward
found
to
be
mere
coincidence
and
that
found
to
be
real
connection
actually
provokes
thought
it
is
only
as
an
experience
previously
accepted
comes
up
in
its
wholeness
against
another
one
equally
integral
and
only
as
some
larger
experience
dawns
which
requires
each
as
a
part
of
itself
and
yet
within
which
the
required
factors
show
themselves
mutually
incompatible
that
thought
arises
it
is
not
bare
coincidence
or
bare
connection
or
bare
addition
of
one
to
the
other
that
excites
thought
the
stimulus
is
a
situation
which
is
organized
or
constituted
as
a
whole
and
yet
which
is
falling
to
pieces
in
its
parts
a
situation
which
is
in
conflict
within
itself
that
arouses
the
search
to
find
what
really
goes
together
and
a
correspondent
effort
to
shut
out
what
only
seemingly
goes
together
and
real
coherence
means
precisely
capacity
to
exist
within
the
comprehending
whole
to
read
back
into
the
preliminary
situation
those
distinctions
of
mere
conjunction
of
material
and
of
valid
coherence
which
get
existence
to
say
nothing
of
fixation
only
within
the
process
of
inquiry
is
a
fallacy
we
must
not
leave
this
phase
of
the
discussion
however
until
it
is
quite
clear
that
our
objection
is
not
to
lotze
position
that
reflective
thought
arises
from
an
antecedent
which
is
not
reflectional
in
character
nor
yet
to
his
idea
that
this
antecedent
has
a
certain
structure
and
content
of
its
own
setting
the
peculiar
problem
of
thought
giving
the
cue
to
its
specific
activities
and
determining
its
object
on
the
contrary
it
is
this
latter
point
upon
which
we
would
insist
so
as
by
insisting
to
point
out
negatively
that
this
view
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
lotze
theory
that
psychical
impressions
and
ideas
are
the
true
antecedents
of
thought
and
positively
to
show
that
it
is
the
as
a
and
not
any
one
isolated
part
of
it
or
distinction
within
it
that
calls
forth
and
directs
thinking
we
must
beware
the
fallacy
of
assuming
that
some
one
element
in
the
prior
situation
in
isolation
or
detachment
induces
the
reflection
which
in
reality
comes
forth
only
from
the
whole
disturbed
situation
on
the
negative
side
characterizations
of
impression
and
idea
are
distinctions
which
arise
only
within
reflection
upon
that
situation
which
is
the
genuine
antecedent
of
thought
positively
it
is
the
whole
dynamic
experience
with
its
qualitative
and
pervasive
continuity
and
its
inner
active
distraction
its
elements
at
odds
with
each
other
in
tension
against
each
other
each
contending
for
its
proper
placing
and
relationship
which
generates
the
from
this
point
of
view
at
this
period
of
development
the
distinctions
of
objective
and
subjective
have
a
characteristic
meaning
the
antecedent
to
repeat
is
a
situation
in
which
the
various
factors
are
actively
incompatible
with
each
other
and
yet
in
and
through
the
striving
tend
to
a
of
the
whole
and
to
a
restatement
of
the
parts
this
situation
as
such
is
clearly
it
is
there
it
is
there
as
a
whole
the
various
parts
are
there
and
their
active
incompatibility
with
one
another
is
there
nothing
is
conveyed
at
this
point
by
asserting
that
any
particular
part
of
the
situation
is
illusory
or
subjective
or
mere
appearance
or
that
any
other
is
truly
real
the
experience
exists
as
one
of
vital
and
active
confusion
and
conflict
among
its
elements
the
conflict
is
not
only
objective
in
a
sense
that
is
really
existent
but
is
objective
in
a
logical
sense
as
well
it
is
just
this
conflict
which
effects
a
transition
into
the
this
in
turn
being
only
a
constant
movement
toward
a
defined
equilibrium
the
conflict

deny
an
organization
of
things
within
which
competing
incompatible
tendencies
appear

thinking
becomes
merely
mental

attitude

of
na√Øve

deliberate

or

scientific
research
has
risen
through
the
medium
of

objective
situation
the
abstract
logician
may
tell
us
that
sensations
or
impressions
or
associated
ideas
or
bare
physical
things
or
conventional
symbols
are
antecedent
conditions
but
such
statements
can
not

by
reference
to
a

of

in

with

they

they
are
stimuli
to

in

their

to
form

occasions

and
thus
reciprocal
tension
symbols
and
their
definitions
develop
to
a
point
where
dealing
with
them
becomes
itself
an
experience
having
its
own
identity
just
as
the
handling
of
commercial
commodities
or
arrangement
of
parts
of
an
invention
is
a
specific
experience
there
is
always
as
antecedent
to
thought
an
experience
of
of
the
physical
or
social
world
or
the
previously
organized
intellectual
world
whose
parts
are
actively
at
war
with
each
other
so
much
so
that
they
threaten
to
disrupt
the
situation
which
accordingly
for
its
own
maintenance
requires
deliberate
redefinition
and
of
its
tensional
parts
this
redefining
and
is
the
constructive
process
termed
thinking
the
reconstructive
situation
with
its
parts
in
tension
and
in
such
movement
toward
each
other
as
tends
to
a
unified
arrangement
of
things
is
the
this
at
once
suggests
the
subjective
phase
the
situation
the
experience
as
such
is
objective
there
is
an
experience
of
the
confused
and
conflicting
tendencies
but
just
in
is
objective
just
form
the
situation
shall
take
as
an
organized
harmonious
whole
is
unknown
that
is
the
problem
it
is
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
of
the
experience
together
with
the
certainty
there
is
such
an
experience
that
evokes
the
viewed
from
this
standpoint
of
uncertainty
the
situation
as
a
whole
is
subjective
no
particular
content
or
reference
can
be
asserted
offhand
definite
assertion
is
expressly
reserved
it
is
to
be
the
outcome
of
the
procedure
of
reflective
inquiry
now
undertaken
this
holding
off
of
contents
from
definitely
asserted
position
this
viewing
them
as
candidates
for
reform
is
what
we
mean
at
this
stage
of
the
natural
history
of
thought
by
the
subjective
we
have
followed
lotze
through
his
tortuous
course
of
inconsistencies
it
is
better
perhaps
to
run
the
risk
of
vain
repetition
than
that
of
leaving
the
impression
that
these
are
dialectical
contradictions
it
is
an
idle
task
to
expose
contradictions
unless
we
realize
them
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
assumption
which
breeds
them
lotze
is
bound
to
differentiate
thought
from
its
antecedents
he
is
intent
upon
doing
this
however
through
a
preconception
that
marks
off
the
radically
from
its
predecessor
through
a
difference
that
is
complete
fixed
and
absolute
or
at
large
it
is
a
total
contrast
of
thought
as
such
to
something
else
as
such
that
he
requires
not
a
contrast
within
experience
of
one
temporal
phase
of
a
process
one
period
of
a
rhythm
from
others
this
complete
and
rigid
difference
lotze
finds
in
the
difference
between
an
experience
which
is
or
occurrence
and
one
which
has
to
do
with
worth
truth
right
relationship
now
things
have
connection
organization
value
or
force
practical
and
aesthetic
meaning
on
their
own
account
the
same
is
true
of
deeds
affections
etc
only
states
of
feelings
bare
impressions
seem
to
fulfil
the
prerequisite
of
being
given
as
existence
and
yet
without
qualification
as
to
worth
etc
then
the
current
of
ideas
offers
itself
a
stream
of
events
of
existences
which
can
be
characterized
as
wholly
innocent
of
reflective
determination
and
as
the
natural
predecessor
of
thought
but
this
stream
of
existences
is
no
sooner
regarded
than
its
total
incapacity
to
officiate
as
material
condition
and
cue
of
thought
appears
it
is
about
as
relevant
to
thinking
as
are
changes
that
may
be
happening
on
the
other
side
of
the
moon
so
one
by
one
the
whole
series
of
determinations
of
force
and
worth
already
traced
are
introduced
the
very
the
inner
structure
of
what
was
to
be
existence
things
of
whose
spatial
and
temporal
relations
the
mere
impressions
are
somehow
the
idea
as
significant
possessed
of
quality
and
not
a
mere
event
distinguished
traits
of
coincidence
and
coherence
within
the
stream
all
these
features
are
explicitly
asserted
as
we
have
seen
underlying
and
running
through
them
all
is
the
recognition
of
the
supreme
value
of
a
situation
which
has
been
organized
as
a
whole
yet
is
now
conflicting
in
its
inner
constitution
these
contradictions
all
arise
in
the
attempt
to
put
thought
work
as
concerned
with
objective
validity
over
against
experience
as
a
mere
antecedent
happening
or
occurrence
this
contrast
arises
because
of
the
attempt
to
consider
thought
as
an
independent
somewhat
in
general
which
nevertheless
in
experience
is
dependent
upon
a
raw
material
of
mere
impressions
given
to
it
hence
the
sole
radical
avoidance
of
the
contradictions
can
be
secured
only
when
thinking
is
seen
to
be
a
specific
event
in
the
movement
of
experienced
things
having
its
own
specific
occasion
or
demand
and
its
own
specific
place
the
nature
of
the
organization
and
force
that
the
antecedent
conditions
of
the
possess
is
too
large
a
question
here
to
enter
upon
in
detail
lotze
himself
suggests
the
answer
he
speaks
of
the
current
of
ideas
just
as
a
current
supplying
us
with
the
mass
of
information
which
daily
i
it
gives
rise
to
useful
combinations
correct
expectations
seasonable
reactions
i
he
speaks
of
it
indeed
as
if
it
were
just
the
ordinary
world
of
na√Øve
experience
the
empirical
world
as
distinct
from
the
world
as
critically
revised
and
rationalized
in
scientific
and
philosophic
inquiry
the
contradiction
between
this
interpretation
and
that
of
a
mere
stream
of
psychical
impressions
is
only
another
instance
of
the
difficulty
already
discussed
but
the
phraseology
suggests
the
real
state
of
things
the
unreflective
world
is
a
world
of
practical
things
of
ends
and
means
of
their
effective
adaptations
of
control
and
regulation
of
conduct
in
view
of
results
the
world
of
uncritical
experience
also
is
a
world
of
social
aims
and
means
involving
at
every
turn
the
goods
and
objects
of
affection
and
attachment
of
competition
and
it
has
incorporate
also
in
its
own
being
the
surprise
of
aesthetic
values
the
sudden
joy
of
light
the
gracious
wonder
of
tone
and
form
i
do
not
mean
that
this
holds
in
gross
of
the
unreflective
world
of
experience
over
against
the
critical
such
a
contrast
implies
the
very
wholesale
at
large
consideration
of
thought
which
i
am
striving
to
avoid
doubtless
many
and
many
an
act
of
thought
has
intervened
in
effecting
the
organization
of
our
commonest
environment
i
only
mean
to
indicate
that
thought
does
take
place
such
a
world
not
a
world
of
bare
existences
and
that
while
the
more
systematic
reflection
we
call
organized
science
may
in
some
fair
sense
be
said
to
come
it
comes
after
affectional
artistic
and
technological
interests
which
have
found
realization
having
entered
so
far
upon
a
suggestion
which
can
not
be
followed
out
i
venture
one
other
digression
the
notion
that
value
or
significance
as
distinct
from
mere
existentiality
is
the
product
of
thought
or
reason
and
that
the
source
of
lotze
contradictions
lies
in
the
effort
to
find
situation
prior
or
antecedent
to
thought
is
a
familiar
one
it
is
even
possible
that
my
criticisms
of
lotze
have
been
interpreted
by
some
readers
in
this
sense
this
is
the
position
frequently
called
though
i
think
with
questionable
accuracy
and
has
been
developed
by
many
writers
in
criticizing
kant
this
position
and
that
taken
in
this
chapter
do
indeed
agree
in
certain
general
regards
they
are
at
one
in
denial
of
the
factuality
and
the
possibility
of
developing
fruitful
reflection
out
of
antecedent
bare
existence
or
mere
events
they
unite
in
denying
that
there
is
or
can
be
any
such
thing
as
existence
phenomenon
unqualified
as
respects
organization
and
force
whether
such
phenomenon
be
psychic
or
cosmic
they
agree
that
reflective
thought
grows
organically
out
of
an
experience
which
is
already
organized
and
that
it
functions
within
such
an
organism
but
they
part
company
when
a
fundamental
question
is
raised
is
all
organized
meaning
the
work
of
thought
does
it
therefore
follow
that
the
organization
out
of
which
reflective
thought
grows
is
the
work
of
thought
of
some
other
type
of
pure
thought
creative
or
constitutive
thought
intuitive
reason
i
shall
indicate
briefly
the
reasons
for
divergence
at
this
point
to
cover
all
the
objects
involved
the
term
thought
has
to
be
so
stretched
that
the
situation
might
as
well
be
called
by
any
other
name
that
describes
a
typical
form
of
experience
more
specifically
when
the
difference
is
minimized
between
the
organized
and
arranged
scheme
out
of
which
reflective
inquiry
proceeds
and
reflective
inquiry
itself
and
there
can
be
no
other
reason
for
insisting
that
the
antecedent
of
reflective
thought
is
itself
somehow
thought
exactly
the
same
type
of
problem
recurs
which
presents
itself
when
the
distinction
is
exaggerated
into
one
between
bare
existences
and
rational
coherent
meanings
for
the
more
one
insists
that
the
antecedent
situation
is
constituted
by
thought
the
more
one
has
to
wonder
why
another
type
of
thought
is
required
what
need
arouses
it
and
how
it
is
possible
for
it
to
improve
upon
the
work
of
previous
constitutive
thought
this
difficulty
at
once
forces
idealists
from
a
logic
of
experience
as
it
is
concretely
experienced
into
a
metaphysic
of
a
purely
hypothetical
experience
constitutive
thought
precedes
conscious
hence
it
must
be
the
working
of
some
absolute
universal
thought
which
unconsciously
to
our
reflection
builds
up
an
organized
world
but
this
recourse
only
deepens
the
difficulty
how
does
it
happen
that
the
absolute
constitutive
and
intuitive
thought
does
such
a
poor
and
bungling
job
that
it
requires
a
finite
discursive
activity
to
patch
up
its
products
here
more
metaphysic
is
called
for
the
absolute
reason
is
now
supposed
to
work
under
limiting
conditions
of
finitude
of
a
sensitive
and
temporal
organism
the
antecedents
of
reflective
thought
are
not
therefore
determinations
of
thought
pure
and
undefiled
but
of
what
thought
can
do
when
it
stoops
to
assume
the
yoke
of
change
and
of
feeling
i
pass
by
the
metaphysical
problem
left
unsolved
by
this
flight
why
and
how
should
a
perfect
absolute
complete
finished
thought
find
it
necessary
to
submit
to
alien
disturbing
and
corrupting
conditions
in
order
in
the
end
to
recover
through
reflective
thought
in
a
partial
piecemeal
wholly
inadequate
way
what
it
possessed
at
the
outset
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
way
i
confine
myself
to
the
logical
difficulty
how
can
thought
relate
itself
to
the
fragmentary
sensations
impressions
feelings
which
in
their
contrast
with
and
disparity
from
the
workings
of
constitutive
thought
mark
it
off
from
the
latter
and
which
in
their
connection
with
its
products
give
the
cue
to
reflective
thinking
we
have
again
exactly
the
problem
with
which
lotze
has
been
we
have
the
same
insoluble
question
of
the
reference
of
to
a
wholly
indeterminate
unrationalized
independent
prior
existence
the
absolute
idealist
who
takes
up
the
problem
at
this
point
will
find
himself
forced
into
the
same
continuous
seesaw
the
same
scheme
of
alternate
rude
robbery
and
gratuitous
gift
that
lotze
engaged
in
the
simple
fact
is
that
here
just
where
lotze
began
he
saw
that
previous
transcendental
logicians
had
left
untouched
the
specific
question
of
relation
of
supposedly
finite
reflective
thought
to
its
own
antecedents
and
he
set
out
to
make
good
the
defect
if
reflective
thought
is
required
because
constitutive
thought
works
under
externally
limiting
conditions
of
sense
then
we
have
some
elements
which
are
after
all
mere
existences
events
etc
or
if
they
have
organization
from
some
other
source
than
thought
and
induce
reflective
thought
not
as
bare
impressions
but
through
their
place
in
some
whole
then
we
have
admitted
the
possibility
of
organization
in
experience
apart
from
reason
and
the
ground
for
assuming
pure
constitutive
thought
is
abandoned
the
contradiction
appears
equally
when
viewed
from
the
side
of
and
its
characteristic
forms
all
our
knowledge
after
all
of
thought
as
constitutive
is
gained
by
consideration
of
the
operations
of
reflective
thought
the
perfect
system
of
thought
is
so
perfect
that
it
is
a
luminous
harmonious
whole
without
definite
parts
or
distinctions
or
if
there
are
such
it
is
only
reflection
that
brings
them
out
the
categories
and
methods
of
constitutive
thought
itself
must
therefore
be
characterized
in
terms
of
the
of
reflective
thought
yet
the
latter
takes
place
just
because
of
the
peculiar
problem
of
the
peculiar
conditions
under
which
it
arises
its
work
is
progressive
reformatory
reconstructive
synthetic
in
the
terminology
made
familiar
by
kant
we
are
not
only
justified
accordingly
in
transferring
its
determinations
over
to
constitutive
thought
but
are
prohibited
from
attempting
any
such
transfer
to
identify
logical
processes
states
devices
results
which
are
conditioned
upon
the
primary
fact
of
resistance
to
thought
as
constitutive
with
the
structure
of
constitutive
thought
is
as
complete
an
instance
of
the
fallacy
of
recourse
from
one
genus
to
another
as
could
well
be
found
constitutive
and
reflective
thought
are
first
defined
in
terms
of
their
dissimilarity
and
even
opposition
and
then
without
more
ado
the
forms
of
the
description
of
the
latter
are
carried
over
bodily
to
the
former
this
is
not
a
merely
controversial
criticism
it
points
positively
toward
the
fundamental
thesis
of
these
chapters
all
the
distinctions
discovered
within
thinking
of
conception
as
over
against
sense
perception
of
various
modes
and
forms
of
judgment
of
inference
in
its
vast
diversity
of
operation
all
these
distinctions
come
within
the
as
growing
out
of
a
characteristic
antecedent
typical
formation
of
experience
and
have
for
their
purpose
the
solution
of
the
peculiar
problem
with
respect
to
which
the
is
generated
or
evolved
the
restoration
of
a
deliberately
integrated
experience
from
the
inherent
conflict
into
which
it
has
fallen
the
failure
of
transcendental
logic
has
the
same
origin
as
the
failure
of
the
empiristic
whether
taken
pure
or
in
the
mixed
form
in
which
lotze
presents
it
it
makes
into
absolute
and
fixed
distinctions
of
existence
and
meaning
and
of
one
kind
of
meaning
and
another
kind
things
which
are
historic
or
temporal
in
their
origin
and
their
significance
it
views
thought
as
attempting
to
represent
or
state
reality
once
for
all
instead
of
trying
to
determine
some
phases
or
contents
of
it
with
reference
to
their
more
effective
and
significant
employ
instead
of
as
reconstructive
the
rock
against
which
every
such
logic
splits
is
that
either
existence
already
has
the
statement
which
thought
is
endeavoring
to
give
it
or
else
it
has
not
in
the
former
case
thought
is
futilely
reiterative
in
the
latter
it
is
falsificatory
the
significance
of
lotze
for
critical
purposes
is
that
his
peculiar
effort
to
combine
a
transcendental
view
of
thought
of
thought
as
active
in
forms
of
its
own
pure
in
and
of
themselves
with
certain
obvious
facts
of
the
dependence
of
our
thought
upon
specific
empirical
antecedents
brings
to
light
fundamental
defects
in
both
the
empiristic
and
the
transcendental
logics
we
discover
a
common
failure
in
both
the
failure
to
view
logical
terms
and
distinctions
with
respect
to
their
necessary
function
in
the
redintegration
of
experience

activity
and
i
can
not
agree
that
reality
as
such
with
increasing
fulness
of
knowledge
presents
itself
as
a
though
as
just
indicated
i
have
no
doubt
that
practical
existence
presents
itself
in
its
temporal
course
as
just
as
it
does
as
affectional
and
aesthetic
and
the
rest
of
them
iv
data
and
meanings
we
have
reached
the
point
of
conflict
in
the
matters
of
an
experience
it
is
this
conflict
and
because
of
it
that
the
matters
or
significant
quales
stand
out
matters
as
long
as
the
sun
revolves
about
earth
without
question
this
content
is
not
in
any
way
abstracted
its
distinction
from
the
form
or
mode
of
experience
as
its
matter
is
the
work
of
reflection
the
same
conflict
makes
other
experiences
assume
discriminated
objectification
they
too
cease
to
be
ways
of
living
and
become
distinct
objects
of
observation
and
consideration
the
movements
of
planets
eclipses
are
cases
in
point
the
maintenance
of
a
unified
experience
has
become
a
problem
an
end
for
it
is
no
longer
secure
but
this
involves
such
restatement
of
the
conflicting
elements
as
will
enable
them
to
take
a
place
somewhere
in
the
world
of
the
new
experience
they
must
be
disposed
of
somehow
and
they
can
be
disposed
of
finally
only
as
they
are
provided
for
that
is
they
can
not
be
simply
denied
or
excluded
or
eliminated
they
must
be
taken
into
the
fold
but
such
introduction
clearly
demands
more
or
less
modification
or
transformation
on
their
part
the
is
the
deliberate
maintenance
of
an
organization
in
experience
with
a
critical
consideration
of
the
claims
of
the
various
conflicting
contents
to
a
place
and
a
final
assignment
of
position
the
conflicting
situation
inevitably
polarizes
or
dichotomizes
itself
there
is
somewhat
which
is
untouched
in
the
contention
of
incompatibles
there
is
something
which
remains
secure
unquestioned
on
the
other
hand
there
are
elements
which
are
doubtful
and
precarious
this
gives
the
framework
of
the
general
distribution
of
the
field
into
facts
the
given
the
presented
the
datum
and
ideas
the
the
conceived
the
inferential
there
is
always
something
unquestioned
in
any
problematic
situation
at
any
stage
of
its
process
even
if
it
be
only
the
fact
of
conflict
or
tension
for
this
is
never
tension
at
large
it
is
thoroughly
qualified
or
characteristically
toned
and
colored
by
the
particular
elements
which
are
in
strife
hence
it
is
conflict
unique
and
irreplaceable
that
it
comes
now
means
precisely
that
it
has
never
come
before
that
it
is
now
passed
in
review
and
some
sort
of
a
settlement
reached
means
that
just
conflict
will
never
recur
in
a
word
the
conflict
is
immediately
of
just
this
and
no
other
sort
and
this
immediately
given
quality
is
an
irreducible
datum
is
fact
even
if
all
else
be
as
it
is
subjected
to
examination
it
loses
vagueness
and
assumes
more
definite
form
only
in
very
extreme
cases
however
does
the
assured
unquestioned
element
reduce
to
terms
as
low
as
we
have
here
imagined
certain
things
come
to
stand
forth
as
facts
no
matter
what
else
may
be
doubted
there
are
certain
diurnal
changes
of
the
sun
there
is
a
certain
annual
course
or
track
there
are
certain
nocturnal
changes
in
the
planets
and
certain
seasonal
rhythmic
paths
the
significance
of
these
may
be
doubted
do
they
real
change
in
the
sun
or
in
the
earth
but
change
and
change
of
a
certain
definite
and
numerically
determinate
character
is
there
it
is
clear
that
such
facts
constitute
the
data
the
given
or
presented
in
the
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
only
one
correspondent
or
status
in
the
total
situation
with
the
consciousness
of
as
certain
as
given
to
be
reckoned
with
goes
the
consciousness
of
uncertainty
as
to
it
of
how
it
is
to
be
understood
or
interpreted
that
is
of
its
reference
and
connection
the
facts
qua
presentations
or
existences
are
sure
meanings
position
and
relationship
in
an
experience
yet
to
be
secured
they
are
doubtful
yet
doubt
does
not
preclude
memory
or
anticipation
indeed
it
is
possible
only
through
them
the
memory
of
past
experience
makes
an
object
of
attentive
regard
the
recollection
of
certain
other
experiences
suggests
the
idea
of
and
these
contents
are
as
much
present
as
is
the
observation
of
change
but
as
respects
connection
they
are
only
possibilities
accordingly
they
are
categorized
or
disposed
of
as
ideas
meanings
thoughts
ways
of
conceiving
comprehending
interpreting
facts
correspondence
of
reference
here
is
as
obvious
as
correlation
of
existence
in
the
logical
process
the
datum
is
not
just
external
existence
and
the
idea
mere
psychical
existence
both
are
modes
of
existence
one
of
existence
the
other
of
of
inferred
existence
and
if
the
latter
is
regarded
from
the
standpoint
of
the
unified
experience
aimed
at
as
having
only
existence
the
datum
also
is
regarded
as
incomplete
and
unassured
or
as
we
commonly
put
it
while
the
ideas
are
impressions
suggestions
guesses
theories
estimates
facts
are
crude
raw
unorganized
brute
they
lack
relationship
that
is
assured
place
they
are
deficient
as
to
continuity
mere
change
of
relative
position
of
sun
which
is
absolutely
unquestioned
as
datum
is
a
sheer
abstraction
from
the
standpoint
either
of
the
organized
experience
left
behind
or
of
the
reorganized
experience
which
is
the
end
the
objective
it
is
impossible
as
a
persistent
object
in
other
words
datum
and
ideatum
are
divisions
of
labor
instrumentalities
for
economical
dealing
with
the
problem
of
the
maintenance
of
the
integrity
of
experience
once
more
and
briefly
both
datum
and
ideatum
may
and
positively
veritably
do
break
up
each
for
itself
into
physical
and
mental
in
so
far
as
the
conviction
gains
ground
that
the
earth
revolves
about
the
sun
the
old
fact
is
broken
up
into
a
new
cosmic
existence
and
a
new
psychological
condition
the
recognition
of
a
process
in
virtue
of
which
movements
of
smaller
bodies
in
relation
to
very
remote
larger
bodies
are
interpreted
in
a
reverse
sense
we
do
not
just
eliminate
the
source
of
error
in
the
old
content
we
reinterpret
it
as
valid
in
its
own
place
a
case
of
the
psychology
of
perception
although
invalid
as
a
matter
of
cosmic
structure
until
we
have
detected
the
source
of
error
as
itself
a
perfectly
genuine
existence
we
are
not
scientifically
satisfied
if
we
decide
that
the
snake
is
but
a
hallucination
our
reflection
is
not
in
purport
complete
until
we
have
found
some
fact
just
as
existential
as
the
snake
would
have
been
had
it
been
there
which
accounts
for
the
hallucination
we
never
stop
except
temporarily
with
a
reference
to
the
mind
or
knower
as
source
of
an
error
we
hunt
for
a
specific
existence
in
other
words
with
increasing
accuracy
of
determination
of
the
given
there
comes
a
distinction
for
methodological
purposes
between
the
or
matter
of
the
sense
experience
and
its
the
sense
perceiving
as
itself
a
psychological
fact
having
its
own
place
and
laws
or
relations
moreover
the
old
experience
that
of
abides
but
it
is
regarded
as
belonging
to
me
to
this
experiencing
individual
rather
than
to
the
cosmic
world
here
then
the
growth
of
the
and
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
determining
truth
under
conditions
we
get
for
the
first
time
the
clue
to
that
distinction
with
which
as
and
prior
to
all
thinking
lotze
started
out
namely
the
separation
of
the
matter
of
impression
from
impression
as
a
personal
event
the
separation
which
taken
at
large
engenders
an
insoluble
problem
appears
within
a
particular
reflective
inquiry
as
an
inevitable
differentiation
of
a
scheme
of
existence
the
same
sort
of
thing
occurs
on
the
side
of
thought
or
meaning
the
meaning
or
idea
which
is
growing
in
acceptance
which
is
gaining
ground
as
gets
logical
or
intellectual
or
objective
force
that
which
is
losing
standing
which
is
increasingly
doubtful
gets
qualified
as
just
a
notion
a
fancy
a
prejudice
misconception
or
finally
just
an
error
a
mental
slip
evaluated
as
fanciful
in
it
becomes
a
mere
fancy
in
its
existence
it
is
not
eliminated
but
receives
a
new
reference
or
meaning
thus
the
distinction
between
subjectivity
and
objectivity
is
not
one
between
meaning
as
such
and
datum
as
such
it
is
a
specification
that
emerges
correspondently
in
datum
and
ideatum
that
which
is
left
behind
in
the
evolution
of
accepted
meaning
is
still
characterized
as
real
but
real
now
in
relation
only
to
a
way
of
experiencing
to
a
peculiarity
of
the
organism
that
which
is
moved
toward
is
regarded
as
real
in
a
cosmic
or
sense
data
of
when
we
turn
to
lotze
we
find
that
he
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
the
presented
material
of
thought
its
datum
and
the
typical
characteristic
modes
of
thinking
in
virtue
of
which
the
datum
gets
organization
or
system
it
is
interesting
to
note
also
that
he
states
the
datum
in
terms
different
from
those
in
which
the
antecedents
of
thought
are
defined
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
data
or
material
upon
which
ideas
exercise
themselves
it
is
not
coincidence
collocation
or
succession
that
counts
but
gradation
of
degrees
in
a
scale
it
is
not
things
in
spatial
or
temporal
arrangement
that
are
emphasized
but
qualities
as
mutually
distinguished
yet
resembling
and
classed
there
is
no
inherent
inconceivability
in
the
idea
that
every
impression
should
be
as
incomparably
different
from
every
other
as
sweet
is
from
warm
but
by
a
remarkable
circumstance
such
is
not
the
case
we
have
series
and
networks
of
series
we
have
diversity
of
a
common
diverse
colors
sounds
smells
tastes
etc
in
other
words
the
data
are
sense
qualities
which
fortunately
for
thought
are
given
arranged
as
shades
degrees
variations
or
qualities
of
somewhat
that
is
identical
all
this
is
given
presented
to
our
ideational
activities
even
the
universal
the
common
color
which
runs
through
the
various
qualities
of
blue
green
white
is
not
a
product
of
thought
but
something
which
thought
finds
already
in
existence
it
conditions
comparison
and
reciprocal
distinction
particularly
all
mathematical
determinations
whether
of
counting
number
degree
more
or
less
and
quantity
greatness
and
smallness
come
back
to
this
peculiarity
of
the
datum
here
lotze
dwells
at
considerable
length
upon
the
fact
that
the
very
possibility
as
well
as
the
success
of
thought
is
due
to
this
peculiar
universalization
or
ordering
with
which
its
material
is
given
to
it
such
fitness
in
the
meeting
of
two
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
is
certainly
cause
enough
for
wonder
and
congratulation
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
see
why
lotze
uses
different
categories
in
describing
the
material
of
thought
from
those
employed
in
describing
its
antecedent
conditions
even
though
according
to
him
the
two
are
absolutely
the
same
he
has
different
in
mind
in
one
case
the
material
must
be
characterized
as
evoking
as
incentive
as
stimulus
from
this
point
of
view
the
peculiar
feature
of
spatial
and
temporal
arrangement
in
contrast
with
coherence
or
connection
is
emphasized
but
in
the
other
case
the
material
must
be
characterized
as
affording
stuff
actual
data
are
not
only
what
is
given
thought
but
they
are
also
the
food
the
raw
material
thought
they
must
be
described
as
on
the
one
hand
wholly
outside
of
thought
this
clearly
puts
them
into
the
region
of
sense
perception
they
are
matters
of
given
free
from
all
inferring
judging
relating
influence
sensation
is
just
what
is
called
up
in
memory
or
in
anticipated
projection
it
is
the
immediate
the
irreducible
on
the
other
hand
is
qualitative
and
quales
are
made
up
on
a
common
basis
they
are
degrees
or
grades
of
a
common
quality
thus
they
have
a
certain
setting
of
mutual
distinction
and
reference
which
is
already
almost
if
not
quite
the
effect
of
comparing
of
relating
effects
which
are
the
express
traits
of
thinking
it
is
easy
to
interpret
this
miraculous
gift
of
grace
in
the
light
of
what
has
been
said
the
data
are
in
truth
precisely
that
which
is
selected
and
set
aside
as
present
as
immediate
thus
they
are
to
thought
but
the
selection
has
occurred
in
view
of
the
need
for
thought
it
is
a
listing
of
the
capital
in
the
way
of
the
undisturbed
the
undiscussed
which
thought
can
count
upon
in
this
particular
problem
hence
it
is
not
strange
that
it
has
a
peculiar
fitness
of
adaptation
for
thought
further
work
having
been
selected
with
precisely
that
end
in
view
the
wonder
would
be
if
it
were
not
so
fitted
a
man
may
coin
counterfeit
money
for
use
upon
others
but
hardly
with
the
intent
of
passing
it
off
upon
himself
our
only
difficulty
here
is
that
the
mind
flies
away
from
the
logical
interpretation
of
sense
datum
to
a
notion
of
it
brought
over
from
abstract
psychological
inquiry
the
belief
in
isolated
sensory
quales
which
are
somehow
forced
upon
us
and
forced
upon
us
at
large
and
thus
conditioning
thought
wholly
instead
of
determining
it
as
instrumentalities
or
elements
selected
from
experienced
things
for
that
very
purpose
is
too
fixed
sensory
qualities
forced
upon
us
but
at
large
the
sensory
data
of
experience
always
come
a
they
always
appear
as
variations
in
a
continuum
even
the
thunder
which
breaks
in
upon
me
to
take
the
extreme
of
apparent
discontinuity
and
irrelevancy
disturbs
me
because
it
is
taken
as
thunder
as
a
part
of
the
same
as
that
in
which
my
chair
and
room
and
house
are
located
and
it
is
taken
as
an
influence
which
interrupts
and
disturbs
it
is
part
of
a
common
world
of
causes
and
effects
the
solution
of
continuity
is
itself
practical
or
teleological
and
thus
presupposes
and
affects
continuity
of
purpose
occupations
and
means
in
a
it
is
not
metaphysics
it
is
biology
which
enforces
the
idea
that
actual
sensation
is
not
only
determined
as
an
event
in
a
world
of
events
but
is
an
occurrence
occurring
at
a
certain
period
in
the
control
and
use
of
stimuli
of
thinking
as
sensory
datum
is
material
set
for
work
of
thought
so
the
ideational
forms
with
which
thought
does
its
work
are
apt
and
prompt
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
material
the
accessory
notion
of
ground
of
coherence
turns
out
in
truth
not
to
be
a
formal
or
external
addition
to
the
data
but
a
requalification
of
them
thought
is
accessory
as
accomplice
not
as
addendum
thought
is
to
eliminate
mere
coincidence
and
to
assert
grounded
coherence
lotze
makes
it
clear
that
he
does
not
at
bottom
conceive
of
thought
as
an
activity
in
itself
imposing
a
form
of
coherence
but
that
the
organizing
work
of
thought
is
only
the
progressive
realization
of
an
inherent
unity
or
system
in
the
material
experienced
the
specific
modes
in
which
thought
brings
its
accessory
power
to
bear
names
conception
judgment
and
inference
are
successive
stages
in
the
adequate
organization
of
the
matter
which
comes
to
us
first
as
data
they
are
successive
stages
of
the
effort
to
overcome
the
original
defects
of
the
data
conception
starts
from
the
universal
the
common
element
of
sense
yet
and
this
is
the
significant
point
it
does
not
simply
abstract
this
common
element
and
consciously
generalize
it
over
against
its
own
differences
such
a
universal
is
coherence
just
because
it
does
not
and
dominate
the
temporal
and
local
heterogeneity
the
concept
see
i
is
a
system
of
attributes
held
together
on
the
basis
of
some
ground
or
determining
dominating
principle
a
ground
which
so
controls
all
its
own
instances
as
to
make
them
into
an
inwardly
connected
whole
and
which
so
specifies
its
own
limits
as
to
be
exclusive
of
all
else
if
we
abstract
color
as
the
common
element
of
various
colors
the
result
is
not
a
scientific
idea
or
concept
discovery
of
a
process
of
whose
various
rates
constitute
the
various
colors
of
the
spectrum
gives
the
concept
and
when
we
get
such
a
concept
the
former
mere
temporal
abruptness
of
color
experiences
gives
way
to
ordered
parts
of
a
color
system
the
logical
product
the
concept
in
other
words
is
not
a
formal
seal
or
stamp
it
is
a
thoroughgoing
connection
of
data
in
a
dynamic
continuity
of
existence
the
form
or
mode
of
thought
which
marks
the
continued
transformation
of
the
data
and
the
idea
in
reference
to
each
other
is
judgment
judgment
makes
explicit
the
assumption
of
a
principle
which
determines
connection
within
an
individualized
whole
it
definitely
states
red
as
case
or
instance
of
the
law
or
process
of
color
and
thus
further
overcomes
the
defect
in
or
data
still
left
by
conception
now
judgment
logically
terminates
in
disjunction
it
gives
a
universal
which
may
determine
any
one
of
a
number
of
alternative
defined
particulars
but
which
is
arbitrary
as
to
one
is
selected
systematic
brings
to
light
the
material
conditions
under
which
the
law
or
dominating
universal
applies
to
this
rather
than
that
alternative
particular
and
so
completes
the
ideal
organization
of
the
if
this
act
were
complete
we
should
finally
have
present
to
us
a
whole
on
which
we
should
know
the
determining
and
effective
or
authorizing
elements
and
the
order
of
development
or
hierarchy
of
dependence
in
which
others
follow
from
them
in
this
account
by
lotze
of
the
operations
of
the
forms
of
thought
there
is
clearly
put
before
us
the
picture
of
a
continuous
correlative
determination
of
datum
on
one
side
and
of
idea
or
meaning
on
the
other
till
experience
is
again
integral
data
being
thoroughly
defined
and
connected
and
ideas
being
the
relevant
meanings
of
that
we
have
here
in
outline
a
description
of
what
actually
occurs
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
there
is
as
little
doubt
that
the
description
is
thoroughly
inconsistent
with
supposition
that
the
material
or
data
of
thought
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
antecedent
of
thought
or
that
ideas
conceptions
are
purely
mental
somewhats
extraneously
brought
to
bear
as
the
sole
essential
characteristics
of
thought
upon
a
material
provided
it
means
but
one
thing
the
maintenance
of
unity
and
wholeness
in
experience
through
conflicting
contents
occurs
by
means
of
a
strictly
correspondent
setting
apart
of
facts
to
be
accurately
described
and
properly
related
and
meanings
to
be
adequately
construed
and
properly
referred
the
datum
is
given
the
and
further
qualification
of
ideas
or
meanings
but
even
in
this
aspect
it
presents
a
problem
to
find
out
given
is
an
inquiry
which
taxes
reflection
to
the
uttermost
every
important
advance
in
scientific
method
means
better
agencies
more
skilled
technique
for
simply
detaching
and
describing
what
is
barely
there
or
given
to
be
able
to
find
out
what
can
safely
be
taken
as
as
given
in
any
particular
inquiry
and
hence
be
taken
as
material
for
orderly
and
verifiable
inference
for
fruitful
for
entertaining
of
explanatory
and
interpretative
ideas
is
one
phase
of
the
effort
of
systematic
scientific
inquiry
it
marks
its
inductive
phase
to
take
what
is
discovered
to
be
reliable
evidence
within
a
more
complex
as
if
it
were
given
absolutely
and
in
isolation
or
apart
from
a
particular
historic
situs
and
context
is
the
fallacy
of
empiricism
as
a
logical
theory
to
regard
the
of
conception
judgment
and
inference
as
qualifications
of
pure
thought
apart
from
any
difference
in
objects
instead
of
as
successive
dispositions
in
the
progressive
organization
of
the
material
or
objects
is
the
fallacy
of
rationalism
lotze
like
kant
attempts
to
combine
the
two
thinking
thereby
to
correct
each
by
the
other
lotze
recognizes
the
futility
of
thought
if
the
sense
data
as
data
are
final
if
they
alone
are
real
the
truly
existent
and
valid
he
sees
that
if
the
empiricist
were
right
in
his
assumption
as
to
the
real
worth
of
the
given
data
thinking
would
be
a
ridiculous
pretender
either
toilfully
and
poorly
doing
over
again
what
needs
no
doing
or
making
a
wilful
departure
from
truth
he
realizes
that
thought
is
evoked
because
it
is
needed
and
that
it
has
a
work
to
do
which
is
not
merely
formal
but
which
effects
a
modification
of
the
of
experience
consequently
he
assumes
a
with
certain
forms
and
modes
of
action
of
its
own
a
realm
of
meaning
possessed
of
a
directive
and
normative
worth
of
its
own
the
of
rationalism
his
attempted
compromise
between
the
two
turns
out
to
be
based
on
the
assumption
of
the
indefensible
ideas
of
both
the
notion
of
an
independent
matter
given
to
thought
on
one
side
and
of
an
independent
worth
or
force
of
on
the
other
this
pointing
out
of
inconsistencies
becomes
stale
and
unprofitable
save
as
we
bring
them
back
into
connection
with
their
the
erection
of
distinctions
that
are
genetic
and
historic
and
working
or
instrumental
divisions
of
labor
into
rigid
and
structural
differences
of
reality
lotze
clearly
recognizes
that
thought
nature
is
dependent
upon
its
aim
its
aim
upon
its
problem
and
this
upon
the
situation
in
which
it
finds
its
incentive
and
excuse
its
work
is
cut
out
for
it
it
does
not
what
it
would
but
what
it
must
as
lotze
puts
it
logic
has
to
do
with
thought
not
as
it
would
be
under
hypothetical
conditions
but
as
it
is
i
and
this
statement
is
made
in
explicit
combination
with
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
peculiarity
of
the
material
of
thought
conditions
its
activity
similarly
he
says
in
a
passage
already
referred
to
the
possibility
and
the
success
of
thought
production
in
general
depends
upon
this
original
constitution
and
organization
of
the
whole
world
of
ideas
a
constitution
which
though
not
necessary
in
thought
is
all
the
more
necessary
to
make
thought
possible
as
we
have
seen
the
essential
nature
of
conception
judgment
and
inference
is
dependent
upon
peculiarities
of
the
propounded
material
they
being
forms
dependent
for
their
significance
upon
the
stage
of
organization
in
which
they
begin
from
this
only
one
conclusion
is
possible
if
thought
nature
is
dependent
upon
its
actual
conditions
and
circumstances
the
primary
logical
problem
is
to
study
it
is
to
detect
the
crisis
within
which
thought
and
its
present
themselves
in
their
mutual
distinction
and
but
lotze
is
so
thoroughly
committed
to
a
antecedent
of
some
sort
that
this
genetic
consideration
is
of
no
account
to
him
the
historic
method
is
a
mere
matter
of
psychology
and
has
no
logical
worth
i
we
must
presuppose
a
psychological
mechanism
and
psychological
material
but
logic
is
concerned
not
with
origin
or
history
but
with
authority
worth
value
i
again
logic
is
not
concerned
with
the
manner
in
which
the
elements
utilized
by
thought
come
into
existence
but
their
value
they
have
somehow
come
into
existence
for
the
carrying
out
of
intellectual
operations
i
and
finally
i
have
maintained
throughout
my
work
that
logic
can
not
derive
any
serious
advantage
from
a
discussion
of
conditions
under
which
thought
as
a
psychological
process
comes
the
significance
of
logical
forms
is
to
be
found
in
the
utterances
of
thought
the
laws
which
it
imposes
after
or
during
the
act
of
thinking
not
in
the
conditions
which
lie
back
of
any
which
produce
thought
lotze
in
truth
represents
a
in
the
evolution
of
logical
theory
he
is
too
far
along
to
be
contented
with
the
reiteration
of
the
purely
formal
distinctions
of
a
merely
formal
he
recognizes
that
thought
as
formal
is
the
form
of
some
matter
and
has
its
worth
only
as
organizing
that
matter
to
meet
the
ideal
demands
of
reason
and
that
reason
is
in
truth
only
an
adequate
systematization
of
the
matter
or
content
consequently
he
has
to
open
the
door
to
admit
psychical
processes
which
furnish
this
material
having
let
in
the
material
he
is
bound
to
shut
the
door
again
in
the
face
of
the
processes
from
which
the
material
proceeded
to
dismiss
them
as
impertinent
intruders
if
thought
gets
its
data
in
such
a
surreptitious
manner
there
is
no
occasion
for
wonder
that
the
legitimacy
of
its
dealings
with
the
material
remains
an
open
question
logical
theory
like
every
branch
of
the
philosophic
disciplines
waits
upon
a
surrender
of
the
obstinate
conviction
that
while
the
work
and
aim
of
thought
is
conditioned
by
the
material
supplied
to
it
yet
the
of
its
performances
is
something
to
be
passed
upon
in
complete
abstraction
from
conditions
of
origin
and
development
footnotes
this
is
but
to
say
that
the
presentation
of
objects
as
specifically
different
things
in
experience
is
the
work
of
reflection
and
that
the
discrimination
of
something
from
modes
of
is
also
the
work
of
reflection
the
latter
statement
is
of
course
but
a
particular
case
of
the
first
for
an
act
of
experiencing
is
one
object
among
others
which
may
be
discriminated
out
of
the
original
experience
when
so
discriminated
it
has
exactly
the
same
existential
status
as
any
other
discriminated
object
seeing
and
thing
seen
stand
on
the
same
level
of
existentiality
but
primary
experience
is
innocent
of
the
discrimination
of
the
experienced
and
the
or
mode
of
experiencing
we
are
not
in
it
aware
of
the
seeing
nor
yet
of
objects
something
seen
any
experience
in
all
of
its
phases
is
innocent
of
any
discrimination
of
subject
and
object
it
involves
within
itself
what
may
be
reflectively
discriminated
into
objects
located
outside
the
organism
and
objects
referred
to
the
organism
note
added
in
revision
of
course
this
very
element
may
be
the
precarious
the
ideal
and
possibly
fanciful
of
some
other
situation
but
it
is
to
change
the
historic
into
the
absolute
to
conclude
that
therefore
everything
is
uncertain
all
at
once
or
as
such
this
gives
metaphysical
skepticism
as
distinct
from
the
working
skepticism
which
is
an
inherent
factor
in
all
reflection
and
scientific
inquiry
but
this
is
a
slow
progress
within
reflection
plato
who
was
influential
in
bringing
this
general
distinction
to
consciousness
still
thought
and
wrote
as
if
image
were
itself
a
queer
sort
of
objective
existence
it
was
only
gradually
that
it
was
disposed
of
as
a
phase
of
personal
experiencing
i
it
is
interesting
to
see
how
explicitly
lotze
is
compelled
finally
to
differentiate
two
aspects
in
the
antecedents
of
thoughts
one
of
which
is
necessary
in
order
that
there
may
be
anything
to
call
out
thought
a
lack
or
problem
the
other
in
order
that
when
thought
is
evoked
it
may
find
data
at
hand
that
is
material
in
shape
to
receive
and
respond
to
its
exercise
the
manifold
matter
of
ideas
is
brought
before
us
not
only
in
the
order
of
its
qualitative
but
in
the
rich
of
local
and
temporal
the
of
heterogeneous
form
the
in
connection
with
which
the
efforts
of
thought
to
reduce
coexistence
to
coherence
will
be
made
the
or
ideas
on
the
other
hand
give
occasion
to
separate
to
connect
and
to
count
their
repetitions
i
italics
mine
without
the
heterogeneous
variety
of
the
local
and
temporal
juxtapositions
there
would
be
nothing
to
excite
thought
without
the
systematic
arrangement
of
quality
there
would
be
nothing
to
meet
thought
and
reward
it
for
its
efforts
the
homogeneity
of
qualitative
relationships
the
gives
the
tools
or
instruments
by
which
thought
is
enabled
successfully
to
tackle
the
heterogeneity
of
collocations
and
conjunctions
also
found
in
the
same
material
one
would
suppose
that
when
lotze
reached
this
point
he
might
have
been
led
to
suspect
that
in
his
remarkable
adjustment
of
and
to
one
another
he
must
after
all
be
dealing
not
with
something
prior
to
the
but
with
the
necessary
structures
and
tools
of
the
for
the
identity
of
sensory
experience
with
the
point
of
greatest
strain
and
stress
in
conflicting
or
tensional
experience
see
the
reflex

in
psychology
iii
for
the
accessory
character
of
thought
see
lotze
i
etc
bosanquet
i
and
jones
of
chap
iv
have
called
attention
to
a
curious
inconsistency
in
lotze
treatment
of
judgment
on
one
hand
the
statement
is
as
given
above
judgment
grows
out
of
conception
in
making
explicit
the
determining
relation
of
universal
to
its
own
particular
implied
in
conception
but
on
the
other
hand
judgment
grows
not
out
of
conception
at
all
but
out
of
the
question
of
determining
connection
in
change
lotze
nominal
reason
for
this
latter
view
is
that
the
conceptual
world
is
purely
static
since
the
actual
world
is
one
of
change
we
need
to
pass
upon
what
really
goes
together
is
causal
in
the
change
as
distinct
from
such
as
are
merely
coincident
but
as
jones
clearly
shows
it
is
also
connected
with
the
fact
that
while
lotze
nominally
asserts
that
judgment
grows
out
of
conception
he
treats
conception
as
the
result
of
judgment
since
the
first
view
makes
judgment
a
mere
explication
of
the
content
of
an
idea
and
hence
merely
expository
or
analytic
in
the
kantian
sense
and
so
of
more
than
doubtful
applicability
to
reality
the
affair
is
too
large
to
discuss
here
and
i
will
content
myself
with
referring
to
the
oscillation
between
conflicting
contents
and
gradation
of
sensory
qualities
already
discussed
note
it
is
judgment
which
grows
out
of
the
former
because
judgment
is
the
whole
situation
as
such
conception
is
referable
to
the
latter
because
it
one
abstraction
within
the
whole
the
solution
of
possible
meanings
of
the
data
just
as
the
datum
is
another
in
truth
since
the
sensory
datum
is
not
absolute
but
comes
in
a
historical
context
the
qualities
apprehended
as
constituting
the
datum
simply
define
the
locus
of
conflict
in
the
entire
situation
they
are
attributives
of
the
of
the
colliding
things
not
calm
untroubled
ultimates
on
pp
and
of
vol
i
lotze
recognizes
as
we
have
just
seen
that
as
matter
of
fact
it
is
both
sensory
qualities
in
their
systematic
grading
or
quantitative
determinations
see
i
for
the
recognition
of
the
necessary
place
of
the
quantitative
in
the
true
concept
and
the
rich
variety
of
local
and
temporal
combinations
that
provoke
thought
and
supply
it
with
material
but
as
usual
he
treats
this
simply
as
a
historical
accident
not
as
furnishing
the
key
to
the
whole
matter
in
fine
while
the
heterogeneous
collocations
and
successions
constitute
the
problematic
element
that
stimulates
thought
quantitative
determination
of
the
sensory
quality
furnishes
one
of
the
two
chief
means
through
which
thought
deals
with
the
problem
it
is
a
reduction
of
the
original
colliding
contents
to
a
form
in
which
the
effort
at
redintegration
gets
maximum
efficiency
the
concept
as
ideal
meaning
is
of
course
the
other
partner
to
the
transaction
it
is
getting
the
various
possible
into
such
shape
as
to
make
them
most
useful
in
construing
the
data
the
bearing
of
this
upon
the
subject
and
predicate
of
judgment
can
not
be
discussed
here
see
i
for
lotze
treatment
of
these
distinctions
i
see
also
ii
ii
the
same
is
reiterated
in
ii
where
the
question
of
origin
is
referred
to
as
a
corruption
in
logic
certain
psychical
acts
are
necessary
as
conditions
and
occasions
of
logical
operations
but
the
deep
gulf
between
psychical
mechanism
and
thought
remains
unfilled
v
the
objects
of
thought
in
the
foregoing
discussion
particularly
in
the
last
chapter
we
were
repeatedly
led
to
recognize
that
thought
has
its
own
distinctive
objects
at
times
lotze
gives
way
to
the
tendency
to
define
thought
entirely
in
terms
of
modes
and
forms
of
activity
which
are
exercised
by
it
upon
a
strictly
foreign
material
but
two
motives
continually
push
him
in
the
other
direction
thought
has
a
distinctive
work
to
do
one
which
involves
a
qualitative
transformation
of
at
least
the
of
the
presented
matter
as
fast
as
it
accomplishes
this
work
the
becomes
somehow
as
we
have
just
seen
the
data
are
progressively
organized
to
meet
thought
ideal
of
a
complete
whole
with
its
members
interconnected
according
to
a
determining
principle
such
progressive
organization
throws
backward
doubt
upon
the
assumption
of
the
original
total
irrelevancy
of
the
data
and
to
each
other
a
like
motive
operates
from
the
side
of
the
as
merely
foreign
and
external
it
is
too
heterogeneous
to
lend
itself
to
thought
exercise
and
influence
the
idea
as
we
saw
in
the
first
chapter
is
the
convenient
medium
through
which
lotze
passes
from
the
purely
heterogeneous
psychical
impression
or
event
which
is
totally
irrelevant
to
thought
purpose
and
working
over
to
a
state
of
affairs
which
can
reward
thought
idea
as
meaning
forms
the
bridge
over
from
the
brute
factuality
of
the
psychical
impression
to
the
coherent
value
of
thought
own
content
we
have
in
this
chapter
to
consider
the
question
of
the
idea
or
content
of
thought
from
two
points
of
view
first
the
of
such
a
content
its
consistency
with
lotze
fundamental
premises
secondly
its
character
its
validity
and
test
i
the
question
of
the
possibility
of
a
specific
content
of
thought
is
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
idea
as
meaning
is
the
characteristic
object
of
thought
we
have
thus
far
left
unquestioned
lotze
continual
assumption
of
meaning
as
a
sort
of
the
of
thought
construction
in
his
treatment
of
meaning
lotze
contradictions
regarding
the
antecedents
data
and
content
of
thought
reach
their
full
conclusion
he
expressly
makes
meaning
to
be
the
product
of
thought
activity
and
also
the
unreflective
material
out
of
which
thought
operations
grow
this
contradiction
has
been
worked
out
in
accurate
and
complete
detail
by
professor
jones
he
summarizes
it
as
follows
no
other
way
was
left
to
him
lotze
excepting
this
of
first
attributing
all
to
sense
and
afterwards
attributing
all
to
thought
and
finally
of
attributing
it
to
thought
only
because
it
was
already
in
its
material
this
is
essential
to
his
theory
the
elements
of
knowledge
as
he
describes
them
can
subsist
only
by
the
alternate
robbery
of
each
other
we
have
already
seen
how
strenuously
lotze
insists
upon
the
fact
that
the
given
of
thought
is
to
be
regarded
wholly
as
the
work
of
a
physical
mechanism
without
any
action
of
thought
but
lotze
also
states
that
if
the
products
of
the
psychical
mechanism
are
to
admit
of
combination
in
the
definite
form
of
a
they
each
require
some
previous
shaping
to
make
them
into
logical
and
to
convert
them
from
into
nothing
is
really
more
familiar
to
us
than
this
first
operation
of
thought
the
only
reason
why
we
usually
overlook
it
is
that
in
the
language
which
we
inherit
it
is
already
carried
out
and
it
seems
therefore
to
belong
to
the
presuppositions
of
thought
to
its
own
specific
and
again
i
judgments
can
consist
of
nothing
but
combinations
of
ideas
which
are
no
longer
mere
impressions
every
such
idea
must
have
undergone
at
least
the
simple
formation
mentioned
above
such
ideas
are
lotze
goes
on
to
urge
already
rudimentary
concepts
that
is
to
say
logical
determinations
the
obviousness
of
the
logical
contradiction
of
attributing
to
a
preliminary
specific
work
of
thought
exactly
the
condition
of
affairs
which
is
elsewhere
explicitly
attributed
to
a
psychical
mechanism
prior
to
any
should
not
blind
us
to
its
import
and
relative
necessity
the
impression
it
will
be
recalled
is
a
mere
state
of
our
own
consciousness
a
mood
of
ourselves
as
such
it
has
simply
relations
as
an
event
to
other
similar
events
but
reflective
thought
is
concerned
with
the
relationship
of
a
content
or
matter
to
other
contents
hence
the
impression
must
have
a
matter
before
it
can
come
at
all
within
the
sphere
of
thought
exercise
how
shall
it
secure
this
why
by
a
preliminary
activity
of
thought
which
objectifies
the
impression
blue
as
a
mere
sensuous
irritation
or
feeling
is
given
a
quality
the
meaning
blue
blueness
the
sense
impression
is
objectified
it
is
presented
no
longer
as
a
condition
which
we
undergo
but
as
a
something
which
has
its
being
and
its
meaning
in
itself
and
which
continues
to
be
what
it
is
and
to
mean
what
it
means
whether
we
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
it
is
easy
to
see
here
the
beginning
of
that
activity
which
we
above
appropriated
to
thought
as
it
has
not
yet
got
so
far
as
converting
coexistence
into
coherence
it
has
first
to
perform
the
previous
task
of
investing
each
single
impression
with
an
independent
validity
without
which
the
later
opposition
of
their
real
coherence
to
mere
coexistence
could
not
be
made
in
any
intelligible
sense
this
objectification
which
converts
a
sensitive
state
into
a
sensible
matter
to
which
the
sensitive
state
is
referred
also
gives
this
matter
position
a
certain
typical
character
it
is
not
objectified
in
a
merely
general
way
but
is
given
a
specific
sort
of
objectivity
of
these
sorts
of
objectivity
there
are
three
mentioned
that
of
a
substantive
content
that
of
an
attached
dependent
content
that
of
an
active
relationship
connecting
the
various
contents
with
each
other
in
short
we
have
the
types
of
meaning
embodied
in
language
in
the
form
of
nouns
adjectives
and
verbs
it
is
through
this
preliminary
formative
activity
of
thought
that
reflective
or
thought
has
presented
to
it
a
world
of
meanings
ranged
in
an
order
of
relative
independence
and
dependence
and
arranged
as
elements
in
a
complex
of
meanings
whose
various
constituent
parts
mutually
influence
one
another
meanings
as
usual
lotze
mediates
the
contradiction
between
material
constituted
thought
and
the
same
material
just
presented
thought
by
a
further
position
so
disparate
to
each
that
taken
in
connection
with
each
by
turns
it
seems
to
bridge
the
gulf
after
describing
the
prior
constitutive
work
of
thought
as
above
he
goes
on
to
discuss
a
phase
of
thought
which
is
intermediary
between
this
and
the
third
phase
reflective
thought
proper
this
second
activity
is
that
of
arranging
experienced
quales
in
series
and
groups
thus
ascribing
a
sort
of
universal
or
common
somewhat
to
various
instances
as
already
described
see
on
one
hand
it
is
clearly
stated
that
this
second
phase
of
thought
activity
is
in
reality
the
as
the
first
phase
since
all
objectification
involves
positing
since
positing
involves
distinction
of
one
matter
from
others
and
since
this
involves
placing
it
in
a
series
or
group
in
which
each
is
measurably
marked
off
as
to
the
degree
and
nature
of
its
diversity
from
every
other
we
are
told
that
we
are
only
considering
a
really
inseparable
operation
of
thought
from
two
different
sides
first
as
to
the
effect
which
objectifying
thought
has
upon
the
matter
as
set
over
against
the
feeling
secondly
the
effect
which
this
objectification
has
upon
the
matter
in
relation
to
afterward
however
these
two
operations
are
declared
to
be
radically
different
in
type
and
nature
the
first
is
determinant
and
formative
it
gives
ideas
the
shape
without
which
the
logical
spirit
could
not
accept
them
in
a
way
it
dictates
its
own
laws
to
its
the
second
activity
of
thought
is
rather
passive
and
receptive
it
simply
recognizes
what
is
already
there
thought
can
make
no
difference
where
it
finds
none
already
in
the
matter
of
impressions
the
first
universal
as
we
saw
can
only
be
experienced
in
immediate
sensation
it
is
no
product
of
thought
but
something
that
thought
finds
already
in
existence
the
obviousness
of
this
further
contradiction
is
paralleled
only
by
its
inevitableness
thought
is
in
the
air
is
arbitrary
and
wild
in
dealing
with
meanings
unless
it
gets
its
start
and
cue
from
actual
experience
hence
the
necessity
of
insisting
upon
thought
activity
as
just
recognizing
the
contents
already
given
but
on
the
other
hand
prior
to
the
work
of
thought
there
is
to
lotze
no
content
or
meaning
it
requires
a
work
of
thought
to
detach
anything
from
the
flux
of
sense
irritations
and
invest
it
with
a
meaning
of
its
own
this
dilemma
is
inevitable
to
any
writer
who
declines
to
consider
as
correlative
the
nature
of
and
from
the
standpoint
of
their
generating
conditions
in
the
movement
of
experience
viewed
from
such
a
standpoint
the
principle
of
solution
is
clear
enough
as
we
have
already
seen
the
internal
dissension
of
an
experience
leads
to
detaching
certain
factors
previously
integrated
in
the
concrete
experience
as
aspects
of
its
own
qualitative
coloring
and
to
relegating
them
for
the
time
being
pending
integration
into
further
immediate
qualities
of
a
reconstituted
experience
into
a
world
of
bare
meanings
a
sphere
qualified
as
ideal
throughout
these
meanings
then
become
the
tools
of
thought
in
interpreting
the
data
just
as
the
sense
qualities
which
define
the
presented
situation
are
the
immediate
matter
for
thought
the
two
mutually
are
content
that
is
the
datum
and
the
meaning
as
reciprocally
qualified
by
each
other
constitute
the
objective
of
thought
to
reach
this
unification
is
thought
objective
or
goal
every
successive
of
reflective
inquiry
presents
what
may
be
taken
for
granted
as
the
outcome
of
previous
thinking
and
as
the
determinant
of
further
reflective
procedure
taken
as
defining
the
point
reached
in
the
and
serving
as
constituent
unit
in
further
thought
it
is
content
or
logical
object
lotze
instinct
is
sure
in
identifying
and
setting
over
against
each
other
the
material
given
to
thought
and
the
content
which
is
thought
own
his
contradictions
arise
simply
from
the
fact
that
his
absolute
method
does
not
permit
him
to
interpret
this
joint
identity
and
distinction
in
a
working
and
hence
relative
sense
ii
the
question
of
how
the
existence
of
meanings
or
is
to
be
understood
merges
imperceptibly
into
the
question
of
the
real
objectivity
or
validity
of
such
contents
the
difficulty
for
lotze
is
the
now
familiar
one
so
far
as
his
logic
compels
him
to
insist
that
these
meanings
are
the
possession
and
product
of
thought
since
thought
is
an
independent
activity
the
ideas
are
merely
ideas
there
is
no
test
of
objectivity
beyond
the
thoroughly
unsatisfactory
and
formal
one
of
their
own
mutual
consistency
in
reaction
from
this
lotze
is
thrown
back
upon
the
idea
of
these
contents
as
the
original
matter
given
in
the
impressions
themselves
here
there
seems
to
be
an
objective
or
external
test
by
which
the
reality
of
thought
operations
may
be
tried
a
given
idea
is
verified
or
found
false
according
to
its
measure
of
correspondence
with
the
matter
of
experience
as
such
but
now
we
are
no
better
off
the
original
independence
and
heterogeneity
of
impressions
and
of
thought
is
so
great
that
there
is
no
way
to
compare
the
results
of
the
latter
with
the
former
we
can
not
compare
or
contrast
distinctions
of
worth
with
bare
differences
of
factual
existence
i
the
standard
or
test
of
objectivity
is
so
thoroughly
external
that
by
original
definition
it
is
wholly
outside
the
realm
of
thought
how
can
thought
compare
meanings
with
existences
or
again
the
given
material
of
experience
apart
from
thought
is
precisely
the
relatively
chaotic
and
unorganized
it
even
reduces
itself
to
a
mere
sequence
of
psychical
events
what
sense
is
there
in
directing
us
to
compare
the
highest
results
of
scientific
inquiry
with
the
bare
sequence
of
our
own
states
of
feeling
or
even
with
the
original
data
whose
fragmentary
and
uncertain
character
was
the
exact
motive
for
entering
upon
scientific
inquiry
how
can
the
former
in
any
sense
give
a
check
or
test
of
the
value
of
the
latter
this
is
professedly
to
test
the
validity
of
a
system
of
meanings
by
comparison
with
that
whose
defects
call
forth
the
construction
of
the
system
of
meanings
our
subsequent
inquiry
simply
consists
in
tracing
some
of
the
phases
of
the
characteristic
seesaw
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
horns
of
the
now
familiar
dilemma
either
thought
is
separate
from
the
matter
of
experience
and
then
its
validity
is
wholly
its
own
private
business
or
else
the
objective
results
of
thought
are
already
in
the
antecedent
material
and
then
thought
is
either
unnecessary
or
else
has
no
way
of
checking
its
own
performances
lotze
assumes
as
we
have
seen
a
certain
independent
validity
in
each
meaning
or
qualified
content
taken
in
and
of
itself
blue
has
a
certain
meaning
in
and
of
itself
it
is
an
for
consciousness
as
such
not
merely
its
state
or
mood
after
the
original
sense
irritation
through
which
it
was
mediated
has
entirely
disappeared
it
persists
as
a
valid
meaning
moreover
it
is
an
object
or
content
of
thought
for
others
as
well
thus
it
has
a
double
mark
of
validity
in
the
comparison
of
one
part
of
my
own
experience
with
another
and
in
the
comparison
of
my
experience
as
a
whole
with
that
of
others
here
we
have
a
sort
of
validity
which
does
not
raise
at
all
the
question
of
reality
i
lotze
thus
seems
to
have
escaped
from
the
necessity
of
employing
as
check
or
test
for
the
validity
of
ideas
any
reference
to
a
real
outside
the
sphere
of
thought
itself
such
terms
as
conjunction
franchise
constitution
algebraic
zero
claim
to
possess
objective
validity
yet
none
of
these
professes
to
refer
to
a
reality
beyond
thought
generalizing
this
point
of
view
validity
or
objectivity
of
meaning
means
simply
that
which
is
identical
for
all
consciousness
i
it
is
quite
indifferent
whether
certain
parts
of
the
world
of
thought
indicate
something
which
has
beside
an
independent
reality
outside
of
thinking
minds
or
whether
all
that
it
contains
exists
only
in
the
thoughts
of
those
who
think
it
but
with
equal
validity
for
them
all
i
so
far
it
seems
clear
sailing
difficulties
however
show
themselves
the
moment
we
inquire
what
is
meant
by
a
content
for
all
thought
is
this
to
be
taken
in
a
static
or
in
a
dynamic
way
that
is
to
say
does
it
express
the
fact
that
a
given
content
or
meaning
is
presented
to
the
consciousness
of
all
alike
does
this
coequal
presence
guarantee
an
objectivity
or
does
validity
attach
to
a
given
meaning
or
content
in
the
sense
that
it
directs
and
controls
the
further
exercise
of
thinking
and
thus
the
formation
of
further
objects
of
knowledge
the
former
interpretation
is
alone
consistent
with
lotze
notion
that
the
independent
idea
as
such
is
invested
with
a
certain
validity
or
objectivity
it
alone
is
consistent
with
his
assertion
that
concepts
precede
judgments
it
alone
that
is
to
say
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
reflective
thinking
has
a
sphere
of
ideas
or
meanings
supplied
to
it
at
the
outset
but
it
is
impossible
to
entertain
this
belief
the
stimulus
which
according
to
lotze
goads
thought
on
from
ideas
or
concepts
to
judgments
and
inferences
is
in
truth
simply
the
lack
of
validity
of
objectivity
in
its
original
independent
meanings
or
contents
a
meaning
as
independent
is
precisely
that
which
is
not
invested
with
validity
but
which
is
a
mere
idea
a
notion
a
fancy
at
best
a
surmise
which
may
turn
out
to
be
valid
and
of
course
this
indicates
possible
reference
a
standpoint
to
have
its
value
determined
by
its
further
active
use
blue
as
a
mere
detached
floating
meaning
an
idea
at
large
would
not
gain
in
validity
simply
by
being
entertained
continuously
in
a
given
consciousness
or
by
being
made
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
persistent
object
of
attentive
regard
by
all
human
consciousnesses
if
this
were
all
that
were
required
the
chimera
the
centaur
or
any
other
subjective
construction
could
easily
gain
validity
christian
science
has
made
just
this
notion
the
basis
of
its
philosophy
the
simple
fact
is
that
in
such
illustrations
as
blue
franchise
conjunction
lotze
instinctively
takes
cases
which
are
not
mere
independent
and
detached
meanings
but
which
involve
reference
to
a
of
experience
to
a
region
of
mutually
determining
social
activities
the
conception
that
reference
to
a
activity
does
not
involve
the
same
sort
of
reference
of
a
meaning
beyond
itself
that
is
found
in
physical
matters
and
hence
may
be
taken
quite
innocent
and
free
of
the
problem
of
reference
to
existence
beyond
meaning
is
one
of
the
strangest
that
has
ever
found
lodgment
in
human
thinking
either
both
physical
and
social
reference
or
neither
is
logical
if
neither
then
it
is
because
the
meaning
functions
as
it
originates
in
a
specific
situation
which
carries
with
it
its
own
tests
see
lotze
conception
is
made
possible
only
by
unconsciously
substituting
the
idea
of
an
object
as
a
content
of
thought
for
a
large
number
of
persons
or
a
somewhat
for
every
consciousness
for
the
genuine
definition
of
object
as
a
in
a
scheme
of
activity
the
former
is
consistent
with
lotze
conception
of
thought
but
wholly
indeterminate
as
to
validity
or
intent
the
latter
is
the
test
used
experimentally
in
all
concrete
thinking
but
involves
a
radical
transformation
of
all
lotze
assumptions
a
given
idea
of
the
conjunction
of
the
franchise
or
of
blue
is
valid
not
because
everybody
happens
to
entertain
it
but
because
it
expresses
the
factor
of
control
or
direction
in
a
given
movement
of
experience
the
test
of
validity
of
idea
is
its
functional
or
instrumental
use
in
effecting
the
transition
from
a
relatively
conflicting
experience
to
a
relatively
integrated
one
if
lotze
view
were
correct
blue
valid
once
would
be
valid
always
even
when
red
or
green
were
actually
called
for
to
fulfil
specific
conditions
this
is
to
say
validity
really
refers
to
rightfulness
or
adequacy
of
performance
in
an
asserting
of
connection
not
to
a
meaning
as
contemplated
in
detachment
if
we
refer
again
to
the
fact
that
the
genuine
antecedent
of
thought
is
a
situation
which
is
disorganized
in
its
structural
elements
we
can
easily
understand
how
certain
contents
may
be
detached
and
apart
as
meanings
or
references
actual
or
possible
we
can
understand
how
such
detached
contents
may
be
of
use
in
effecting
a
review
of
the
entire
experience
and
as
affording
standpoints
and
methods
of
a
reconstruction
which
will
maintain
the
integrity
of
behavior
we
can
understand
how
validity
of
meaning
is
measured
by
reference
to
something
which
is
not
mere
meaning
by
reference
to
something
which
lies
beyond
it
as
such
the
reconstitution
of
an
experience
into
which
it
enters
as
method
of
control
that
paradox
of
ordinary
experience
and
of
scientific
inquiry
by
which
objectivity
is
given
alike
to
matter
of
perception
and
to
conceived
relations
to
facts
and
to
laws
affords
no
peculiar
difficulty
because
the
test
of
objectivity
is
everywhere
the
same
anything
is
objective
in
so
far
as
through
the
medium
of
conflict
it
controls
the
movement
of
experience
in
its
reconstructive
transition
there
is
not
first
an
object
whether
of
sense
perception
or
of
conception
which
afterward
somehow
exercises
this
controlling
influence
but
the
objective
is
existence
exercising
the
function
of
control
it
may
only
control
the
act
of
inquiry
it
may
only
set
on
foot
doubt
but
this
is
direction
of
subsequent
experience
and
in
so
far
is
a
token
of
objectivity
it
has
to
be
reckoned
with
so
much
for
the
or
meaning
as
having
a
validity
of
its
own
it
does
not
have
it
as
isolated
or
given
or
static
it
has
it
in
its
dynamic
reference
its
use
in
determining
further
movement
of
experience
in
other
words
the
meaning
having
been
selected
and
made
up
with
reference
to
performing
a
certain
office
in
the
evolution
of
a
unified
experience
can
be
tested
in
no
other
way
than
by
discovering
whether
it
does
what
it
was
intended
to
do
and
what
it
purports
to
do
lotze
has
to
wrestle
with
this
question
of
validity
in
a
further
respect
what
constitutes
the
objectivity
of
thinking
as
a
total
attitude
activity
or
function
according
to
his
own
statement
the
meanings
or
valid
ideas
are
after
all
only
for
logical
thought
validity
is
thus
not
a
property
of
them
in
their
independent
existences
but
of
their
mutual
reference
to
each
other
thinking
is
the
process
of
instituting
these
mutual
references
of
building
up
the
various
scattered
and
independent
into
the
coherent
system
of
thought
what
is
the
validity
of
the
various
forms
of
thinking
which
find
expression
in
the
various
types
of
judgment
and
in
the
various
forms
of
inference
categorical
hypothetical
disjunctive
judgment
inference
by
induction
by
analogy
by
mathematical
equation
classification
theory
of
explanation
all
these
are
processes
of
reflection
by
which
connection
in
an
organized
whole
is
given
to
the
fragmentary
meanings
with
which
thought
sets
out
what
shall
we
say
of
the
validity
of
such
processes
on
one
point
lotze
is
quite
clear
these
various
logical
acts
do
not
really
enter
into
the
constitution
of
the
valid
world
the
logical
forms
as
such
are
maintained
in
the
process
of
thinking
the
world
of
valid
truth
does
not
undergo
a
series
of
contortions
and
evolutions
paralleling
in
any
way
the
successive
steps
and
missteps
the
succession
of
tentative
trials
withdrawals
and
retracings
which
mark
the
course
of
our
own
thinking
lotze
is
explicit
upon
the
point
that
only
the
in
which
the
process
of
thinking
issues
has
objective
validity
the
act
of
thinking
is
purely
and
simply
an
inner
movement
of
our
own
minds
made
necessary
to
us
by
reason
of
the
constitution
of
our
nature
and
of
our
place
in
the
world
ii
here
the
problem
of
validity
presents
itself
as
the
problem
of
the
relation
of
the
act
of
thinking
to
its
own
product
in
his
solution
lotze
uses
two
metaphors
one
derived
from
building
operations
the
other
from
traveling
the
construction
of
a
building
requires
of
necessity
certain
tools
and
extraneous
constructions
stagings
scaffoldings
which
are
necessary
to
effect
the
final
construction
but
which
do
not
enter
into
the
building
as
such
the
activity
has
an
instrumental
though
not
a
constitutive
value
as
regards
its
product
similarly
in
order
to
get
a
view
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
this
view
being
the
objective
the
traveler
has
to
go
through
preliminary
movements
along
devious
courses
these
again
are
antecedent
prerequisites
but
do
not
constitute
a
portion
of
the
attained
view
the
problem
of
thought
as
activity
as
distinct
from
thought
as
content
opens
up
altogether
too
large
a
question
to
receive
complete
consideration
at
this
point
fortunately
however
the
previous
discussion
enables
us
to
narrow
the
point
which
is
in
issue
just
here
the
question
is
whether
the
activity
of
thought
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
independent
function
supervening
entirely
from
without
upon
antecedents
and
directed
from
without
upon
data
or
whether
it
marks
the
phase
of
the
transformation
which
the
course
of
experience
whether
practical
or
artistic
or
socially
affectional
or
whatever
undergoes
for
the
sake
of
its
deliberate
control
if
it
be
the
latter
a
thoroughly
intelligent
sense
can
be
given
to
the
proposition
that
the
activity
of
thinking
is
instrumental
and
that
its
worth
is
found
not
in
its
own
successive
states
as
such
but
in
the
result
in
which
it
comes
to
conclusion
but
the
conception
of
thinking
as
an
independent
activity
somehow
occurring
after
an
independent
antecedent
playing
upon
an
independent
and
finally
effecting
an
independent
result
presents
us
with
just
one
miracle
the
more
i
do
not
question
the
strictly
instrumental
character
of
thinking
the
problem
lies
not
here
but
in
the
interpretation
of
the
nature
of
the
instrument
the
difficulty
with
lotze
position
is
that
it
forces
us
into
the
assumption
of
a
means
and
an
end
which
are
simply
and
only
external
to
each
other
and
yet
necessarily
dependent
upon
each
other
a
position
which
whenever
found
is
thoroughly
lotze
vibrates
between
the
notion
of
thought
as
a
tool
in
the
external
sense
a
mere
scaffolding
to
a
finished
building
in
which
it
has
no
part
nor
lot
and
the
notion
of
thought
as
an
immanent
tool
as
a
scaffolding
which
is
an
integral
part
of
the
very
operation
of
building
and
which
is
set
up
for
the
sake
of
the
which
is
carried
on
effectively
only
with
and
through
a
scaffolding
only
in
the
former
case
can
the
scaffolding
be
considered
as
a
tool
in
the
latter
case
the
external
scaffolding
is
the
instrumentality
the
actual
tool
is
the
of
erecting
the
building
and
this
action
involves
the
scaffolding
as
a
constituent
part
of
itself
the
work
of
building
is
not
set
over
against
the
completed
building
as
mere
means
to
an
end
it
the
end
taken
in
process
or
historically
longitudinally
temporally
viewed
the
scaffolding
moreover
is
not
an
external
means
to
the
process
of
erecting
but
an
organic
member
of
it
it
is
no
mere
accident
of
language
that
building
has
a
double
sense
meaning
at
once
the
process
and
the
finished
product
the
outcome
of
thought
is
the
thinking
activity
carried
on
to
its
own
completion
the
activity
on
the
other
hand
the
outcome
taken
anywhere
short
of
its
own
realization
and
thereby
still
going
on
the
only
consideration
which
prevents
easy
and
immediate
acceptance
of
this
view
is
the
notion
of
thinking
as
something
purely
formal
it
is
strange
that
the
empiricist
does
not
see
that
his
insistence
upon
a
matter
accidentally
given
to
thought
only
strengthens
the
hands
of
the
rationalist
with
his
claim
of
thinking
as
an
independent
activity
separate
from
the
actual
of
the
affairs
of
experience
thinking
as
a
merely
formal
activity
exercised
upon
certain
sensations
or
images
or
objects
sets
forth
an
absolutely
meaningless
proposition
the
psychological
identification
of
thinking
with
the
process
of
association
is
much
nearer
the
truth
it
is
indeed
on
the
way
to
the
truth
we
need
only
to
recognize
that
association
is
of
matters
or
meanings
not
of
ideas
as
existences
or
events
and
that
the
type
of
association
we
call
thinking
differs
from
casual
fancy
and
revery
by
control
in
reference
to
an
end
to
apprehend
how
completely
thinking
is
a
reconstructive
movement
of
actual
contents
of
experience
in
relation
to
each
other
there
is
no
miracle
in
the
fact
that
tool
and
material
are
adapted
to
each
other
in
the
process
of
reaching
a
valid
conclusion
were
they
external
in
origin
to
each
other
and
to
the
result
the
whole
affair
would
indeed
present
an
insoluble
problem
so
insoluble
that
if
this
were
the
true
condition
of
affairs
we
never
should
even
know
that
there
was
a
problem
but
in
truth
both
material
and
tool
have
been
secured
and
determined
with
reference
to
economy
and
efficiency
in
effecting
the
end
desired
the
maintenance
of
a
harmonious
experience
the
builder
has
discovered
that
his
building
means
building
tools
and
also
building
material
each
has
been
slowly
evolved
with
reference
to
its
fit
employ
in
the
entire
function
and
this
evolution
has
been
checked
at
every
point
by
reference
to
its
own
correspondent
the
carpenter
has
not
thought
at
large
on
his
building
and
then
constructed
tools
at
large
but
has
thought
of
his
building
in
terms
of
the
material
which
enters
into
it
and
through
that
medium
has
come
to
the
consideration
of
the
tools
which
are
helpful
this
is
not
a
formal
question
but
one
of
the
place
and
relations
of
the
matters
actually
entering
into
experience
and
they
in
turn
determine
the
taking
up
of
just
those
mental
attitudes
and
the
employing
of
just
those
intellectual
operations
which
most
effectively
handle
and
organize
the
material
thinking
is
adaptation
an
end
the
adjustment
of
particular
objective
contents
the
thinker
like
the
carpenter
is
at
once
stimulated
and
checked
in
every
stage
of
his
procedure
by
the
particular
situation
which
confronts
him
a
person
is
at
the
stage
of
wanting
a
new
house
well
then
his
materials
are
available
resources
the
price
of
labor
the
cost
of
building
the
state
and
needs
of
his
family
profession
etc
his
tools
are
paper
and
pencil
and
compass
or
possibly
the
bank
as
a
credit
instrumentality
etc
again
the
work
is
beginning
the
foundations
are
laid
this
in
turn
determines
its
own
specific
materials
and
tools
again
the
building
is
almost
ready
for
occupancy
the
concrete
process
is
that
of
taking
away
the
scaffolding
clearing
up
the
grounds
furnishing
and
decorating
rooms
etc
this
specific
operation
again
determines
its
own
fit
or
relevant
materials
and
tools
it
defines
the
time
and
mode
and
manner
of
beginning
and
ceasing
to
use
them
logical
theory
will
get
along
as
well
as
does
the
practice
of
knowing
when
it
sticks
close
by
and
observes
the
directions
and
checks
inherent
in
each
successive
phase
of
the
evolution
of
the
cycle
of
experience
the
problem
in
general
of
validity
of
the
thinking
process
as
distinct
from
the
validity
of
this
or
that
process
arises
only
when
thinking
is
isolated
from
its
historic
position
and
its
material
context
see
but
lotze
is
not
yet
done
with
the
problem
of
validity
even
from
his
own
standpoint
the
ground
shifts
again
under
his
feet
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
the
validity
of
the
idea
or
meaning
with
which
thought
is
supposed
to
set
out
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
the
validity
of
the
process
of
thinking
in
reference
to
its
own
product
it
is
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
product
supposing
after
all
that
the
final
meaning
or
logical
idea
is
thoroughly
coherent
and
organized
supposing
it
is
an
object
for
all
consciousness
as
such
once
more
arises
the
question
what
is
the
validity
of
even
the
most
coherent
and
complete
idea
a
question
which
arises
and
will
not
down
we
may
reconstruct
the
notion
of
the
chimera
until
it
ceases
to
be
an
independent
idea
and
becomes
a
part
of
the
system
of
greek
mythology
has
it
gained
in
validity
in
ceasing
to
be
an
independent
myth
in
becoming
an
element
in
systematized
myth
myth
it
was
and
myth
it
remains
mythology
does
not
get
validity
by
growing
bigger
how
do
we
know
the
same
is
not
the
case
with
the
ideas
which
are
the
product
of
our
most
deliberate
and
extended
scientific
inquiry
the
reference
again
to
the
content
as
the
object
of
all
consciousness
proves
nothing
the
of
a
hallucination
does
not
gain
validity
in
proportion
to
its
social
contagiousness
according
to
lotze
the
final
product
is
after
all
still
thought
now
lotze
is
committed
once
for
all
to
the
notion
that
thought
in
any
form
is
directed
by
and
at
an
outside
reality
the
ghost
haunts
him
to
the
last
how
after
all
does
even
the
ideally
perfect
valid
thought
apply
or
refer
to
reality
its
genuine
subject
is
still
beyond
itself
at
the
last
lotze
can
dispose
of
this
question
only
by
regarding
it
as
a
metaphysical
not
a
logical
problem
ii
in
other
words
speaking
we
are
at
the
end
just
exactly
where
we
were
at
the
beginning
in
the
sphere
of
ideas
and
of
ideas
only
plus
a
consciousness
of
the
necessity
of
referring
these
ideas
to
a
reality
which
is
beyond
them
which
is
utterly
inaccessible
to
them
which
is
out
of
reach
of
any
influence
which
they
may
exercise
and
which
transcends
any
possible
comparison
with
their
results
it
is
vain
says
lotze
to
shrink
from
acknowledging
the
circle
here
involved
all
we
know
of
the
external
world
depends
upon
the
ideas
of
it
which
are
within
us
ii
it
is
then
this
varied
world
of
ideas
within
us
which
forms
the
sole
material
directly
given
to
us
ii
as
it
is
the
only
material
given
to
us
so
it
is
the
only
material
with
which
thought
can
end
to
talk
about
knowing
the
external
world
through
ideas
which
are
merely
within
us
is
to
talk
of
an
inherent
there
is
no
common
ground
in
which
the
external
world
and
our
ideas
can
meet
in
other
words
the
original
separation
between
an
independent
and
an
independent
and
purpose
lands
us
inevitably
in
the
metaphysics
of
subjective
idealism
plus
a
belief
in
an
unknown
reality
beyond
which
although
unknowable
is
yet
taken
as
the
ultimate
test
of
the
value
of
our
ideas
at
the
end
after
all
our
maneuvering
we
are
where
we
began
with
two
separate
disparates
one
of
meaning
but
no
existence
the
other
of
existence
but
no
meaning
the
other
aspect
of
lotze
contradiction
which
completes
the
circle
is
clear
when
we
refer
to
his
original
propositions
and
recall
that
at
the
outset
he
was
compelled
to
regard
the
origination
and
conjunctions
of
the
impressions
the
elements
of
ideas
as
themselves
the
effects
exercised
by
a
world
of
things
already
in
existence
see
he
sets
up
an
independent
world
of
thought
and
yet
has
to
confess
that
both
at
its
origin
and
at
its
termination
it
points
with
absolute
necessity
to
a
world
beyond
itself
only
the
stubborn
refusal
to
take
this
initial
and
terminal
reference
of
thought
beyond
itself
as
having
a
or
temporal
meaning
indicating
a
particular
place
of
generation
and
a
particular
point
of
fulfilment
compels
lotze
to
give
such
objective
references
a
transcendental
turn
when
lotze
goes
on
to
say
ii
that
the
measure
of
truth
of
particular
parts
of
experience
is
found
in
asking
whether
when
judged
by
thought
they
are
in
harmony
with
other
parts
of
experience
when
he
goes
on
to
say
that
there
is
no
sense
in
trying
to
compare
the
entire
world
of
ideas
with
a
reality
which
is
excepting
as
it
itself
should
become
an
idea
he
lands
where
he
might
better
have
frankly
commenced
he
saves
himself
from
utter
skepticism
only
by
claiming
that
the
explicit
assumption
of
skepticism
the
need
of
agreement
of
a
idea

arbitrarily

as
it
affects
the
impression

already
been
discussed
see
i
as
we
have
already
seen
the
concept
the
meaning
as
such
is
always
a
factor
or
status
in
a
reflective
situation
it
is
always
a

in
his
and
i
chaps

has
criticized
the
conception
of
meaning
as
valid
but
in
a
way
which
implies
that
there
is
a
difference
between
validity
and
reality
in
the
sense
that
the
meaning
or
content
of
the
valid
idea
becomes
real
only
when
it
is
experienced
in
direct
the
foregoing
implies
of
course
a
difference
between
validity
and

but
finds
the
test
of
validity
in
exercise
of
the

iv
it
is
significant
that
thought
itself
appearing
as
an
act
of
thinking
over
against
its
own
content
is
here
treated
as
psychical
rather
than
as
logical
consequently
as
we
see
in
the
text
it
gives
him
one
more
difficulty
to
wrestle
with
how
a
process
which
is
ex
officio
purely
psychical
and
subjective
can
yet
yield
results
which
are
valid
in
a
logical
to
say
nothing
of
an
ontological
sense
lotze
even
goes
so
far
in
this
connection
as
to
say
that
the
antithesis
between
our
ideas
and
the
objects
to
which
they
are
directed
is
itself
a
part
of

need
only
have
commenced
at
this
point
to
have
traveled
straight
and
arrived
somewhere
but
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
hold
both
this
view
and
that
of
the
original
independent
existence
of
something
given
to
and
in

an
independent

some
stages
of
logical
thought
the
man
in
the
street
when
asked
what
he
thinks
about
a
certain
matter
often
replies
that
he
does
not
think
at
all
he
knows
the
suggestion
is
that
thinking
is
a
case
of
active
uncertainty
set
over
against
conviction
or
unquestioning
assurance
when
he
adds
that
he
does
not
have
to
think
but
knows
the
further
implication
is
that
thinking
when
needed
leads
to
knowledge
that
its
purpose
or
object
is
to
secure
stable
equilibrium
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
paper
to
show
some
of
the
main
stages
through
which
thinking
understood
in
this
way
actually
passes
in
its
attempt
to
reach
its
most
effective
working
that
is
the
maximum
of
reasonable
certainty
i
wish
to
show
how
a
variety
of
modes
of
thinking
easily
recognizable
in
the
progress
of
both
the
race
and
the
individual
may
be
identified
and
arranged
as
successive
species
of
the
relationship
which
doubting
bears
to
assurance
as
various
ratios
so
to
speak
which
the
vigor
of
doubting
bears
to
mere
acquiescence
the
presumption
is
that
the
function
of
questioning
is
one
which
has
continually
grown
in
intensity
and
range
that
doubt
is
continually
chased
back
and
being
cornered
fights
more
desperately
and
thus
clears
the
ground
more
thoroughly
its
successive
stations
or
arrests
constitute
stages
of
thinking
or
to
change
the
metaphor
just
in
the
degree
that
what
has
been
accepted
as
fact
the
object
of
assurance
loses
stable
equilibrium
the
tension
involved
in
the
questioning
attitude
increases
until
a
readjustment
gives
a
new
and
less
easily
shaken
equilibrium
the
natural
tendency
of
man
is
not
to
press
home
a
doubt
but
to
cut
inquiry
as
short
as
possible
the
practical
man
impatience
with
theory
has
become
a
proverb
it
expresses
just
the
feeling
that
since
the
thinking
process
is
of
use
only
in
substituting
certainty
for
doubt
any
apparent
prolongation
of
it
is
useless
speculation
wasting
time
and
diverting
the
mind
from
important
issues
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
is
to
cut
short
the
stay
in
the
sphere
of
doubts
and
suggestions
and
to
make
the
speediest
return
into
the
world
where
one
can
act
the
result
of
course
is
that
difficulties
are
evaded
or
surmounted
rather
than
really
disposed
of
hence
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
practical
man
the
needs
of
practice
of
economy
and
of
efficiency
have
themselves
compelled
a
continual
deepening
of
doubt
and
widening
of
the
area
of
investigation
it
is
within
this
evolution
that
we
have
to
find
our
stages
of
thinking
the
initial
stage
is
where
the
doubt
is
hardly
endured
but
not
entertained
it
is
no
welcome
guest
but
an
intruder
to
be
got
rid
of
as
speedily
as
possible
development
of
alternative
and
competitive
suggestions
the
forming
of
suppositions
of
ideas
goes
but
a
little
way
the
mind
seizes
upon
the
nearest
or
most
convenient
instrument
of
dismissing
doubt
and
reattaining
security
at
the
other
end
is
the
definitive
and
conscious
search
for
problems
and
the
development
of
elaborate
and
systematized
methods
of
investigation
the
industry
and
technique
of
science
between
these
limits
come
processes
which
have
started
out
upon
the
path
of
doubt
and
inquiry
and
then
halted
by
the
way
in
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
beliefs
are
treated
as
something
fixed
and
static
to
those
who
are
using
them
they
are
simply
another
kind
of
fact
they
are
used
to
settle
doubts
but
the
doubts
are
treated
as
arising
quite
outside
the
ideas
themselves
nothing
is
further
from
recognition
than
that
ideas
themselves
are
open
to
doubt
or
need
criticism
and
revision
indeed
the
one
who
uses
static
meanings
is
not
even
aware
that
they
originated
and
have
been
elaborated
for
the
sake
of
dealing
with
conflicts
and
problems
the
ideas
are
just
there
and
they
may
be
used
like
any
providential
dispensation
to
help
men
out
of
the
troubles
into
which
they
have
fallen
words
are
generally
held
responsible
for
this
fixation
of
the
idea
for
this
substantiation
of
it
into
a
kind
of
thing
a
long
line
of
critics
has
made
us
familiar
with
the
invincible
habit
of
supposing
that
wherever
there
is
a
name
there
is
some
reality
corresponding
to
it
of
supposing
that
general
and
abstract
words
have
their
equivalent
objects
somewhere
rerum
as
have
also
singular
and
proper
names
we
know
with
what
simplicity
of
the
english
empirical
school
has
accounted
for
the
ontological
speculation
of
plato
words
tend
to
fix
intellectual
contents
and
give
them
a
certain
air
of
independence
and
individuality
that
some
truth
is
here
expressed
there
can
be
no
question
indeed
the
attitude
of
mind
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
well
illustrated
in
the
person
who
goes
to
the
dictionary
in
order
to
settle
some
problem
in
morals
politics
or
science
who
would
end
some
discussion
regarding
a
material
point
by
learning
what
meaning
is
attached
to
terms
by
the
dictionary
as
authority
the
question
is
taken
as
lying
outside
of
the
sphere
of
science
or
intellectual
inquiry
since
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
idea
is
unquestionable
and
fixed
but
this
petrifying
influence
of
words
is
after
all
only
a
superficial
explanation
there
must
be
some
meaning
present
or
the
word
could
not
fix
it
there
must
be
something
which
accounts
for
the
disposition
to
use
names
as
a
medium
of
fossilization
there
is
in
truth
a
certain
real
fact
an
existent
reality
behind
both
the
word
and
the
meaning
it
stands
for
this
reality
is
social
usage
the
person
who
consults
a
dictionary
is
getting
an
established
fact
when
he
turns
there
for
the
definition
of
a
term
he
finds
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
currently
used
social
customs
are
no
less
real
than
physical
events
it
is
not
possible
to
dispose
of
this
fact
of
common
usage
by
reference
to
mere
convention
or
any
other
arbitrary
device
a
form
of
social
usage
is
no
more
an
express
invention
than
any
other
social
institution
it
embodies
the
permanent
attitude
the
habit
taken
toward
certain
recurring
difficulties
or
problems
in
experience
ideas
or
meanings
fixed
in
terms
show
the
scheme
of
values
which
the
community
uses
in
appraising
matters
that
need
consideration
and
which
are
indeterminate
or
unassured
they
are
held
up
as
standards
for
all
its
members
to
follow
here
is
the
solution
of
the
paradox
the
fixed
or
static
idea
is
a
fact
expressing
an
established
social
attitude
a
custom
it
is
not
merely
verbal
because
it
denotes
a
force
which
operates
as
all
customs
do
in
controlling
particular
cases
but
since
it
marks
a
mode
of
interpretation
a
scheme
for
assigning
values
a
way
of
dealing
with
doubtful
cases
it
falls
within
the
sphere
of
ideas
or
coming
to
the
life
of
the
individual
the
fixed
meaning
represents
not
a
state
of
consciousness
fixed
by
a
name
but
a
recognition
of
a
habitual
way
of
belief
a
habit
of
understanding
we
find
an
apt
illustration
of
fixed
ideas
in
the
rules
prevalent
in
primitive
communities
rules
which
minutely
determine
all
acts
in
which
the
community
as
a
whole
is
felt
to
have
an
interest
these
rules
are
facts
because
they
express
customs
and
carry
with
them
certain
sanctions
their
meaning
does
not
cease
with
judicial
utterance
they
are
made
valid
at
once
in
a
practical
way
against
anyone
who
departs
from
them
yet
as
rules
they
are
ideas
for
they
express
general
ways
of
defining
doubtful
matters
in
experience
and
of
certainty
an
individual
may
fail
in
acknowledgment
of
them
and
explicit
reference
is
then
necessary
for
one
who
has
lost
himself
in
the
notion
that
ideas
are
psychical
and
subjective
i
know
of
no
better
way
to
appreciate
the
significance
of
an
idea
than
to
consider
that
a
social
rule
of
judgment
is
nothing
but
a
certain
way
of
viewing
or
interpreting
facts
as
such
it
is
an
idea
the
point
that
is
of
special
interest
to
us
here
however
is
that
these
ideas
are
taken
as
fixed
and
unquestionable
and
that
the
cases
to
which
they
are
to
apply
are
regarded
as
in
themselves
equally
fixed
so
far
as
concerns
the
attitude
of
those
who
employ
this
sort
of
ideas
the
doubt
is
simply
as
to
what
idea
should
be
in
a
particular
case
even
the
athenian
greeks
for
instance
long
kept
up
the
form
of
indicting
and
trying
a
tree
or
implement
through
which
some
individual
had
been
killed
there
was
a
rule
a
fixed
idea
for
dealing
with
all
who
offended
against
the
community
by
destroying
one
of
its
citizens
the
fact
that
an
inanimate
object
a
thing
without
intention
or
volition
offended
was
not
a
material
circumstance
it
made
no
difference
in
the
case
that
is
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
fact
it
was
as
fixed
as
was
the
rule
with
advance
in
the
complexity
of
life
however
rules
accumulate
and
discrimination
that
is
a
certain
degree
of
inquiring
and
critical
attitude
enters
in
inquiry
takes
effect
however
in
seeking
among
a
collection
of
fixed
ideas
just
the
one
to
be
used
rather
than
in
directing
suspicion
against
any
rule
or
idea
as
such
or
in
an
attempt
to
discover
or
constitute
a
new
one
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
refer
to
the
development
of
casuistry
or
to
the
multiplication
of
distinctions
within
dogmas
or
to
the
growth
of
ceremonial
law
in
cumbrous
detail
to
indicate
what
the
outcome
of
this
logical
stage
is
likely
to
be
the
essential
thing
is
that
doubt
and
inquiry
are
directed
neither
at
the
nature
of
the
intrinsic
fact
itself
nor
at
the
value
of
the
idea
as
such
but
simply
at
the
manner
in
which
one
is
attached
to
the
other
thinking
falls
outside
both
fact
and
idea
and
into
the
sphere
of
their
external
connection
it
is
still
a
fiction
of
judicial
procedure
that
there
is
already
in
existence
some
custom
or
law
under
which
every
possible
dispute
that
is
every
doubtful
or
unassured
case
falls
and
that
the
judge
only
declares
which
law
is
applicable
in
the
particular
case
this
point
of
view
has
tremendously
affected
the
theory
of
logic
in
its
historic
development
one
of
the
chief
perhaps
the
most
important
instrumentalities
in
developing
and
maintaining
fixed
ideas
is
the
need
of
instruction
and
the
way
in
which
it
is
given
if
ideas
were
called
into
play
only
when
doubtful
cases
actually
arise
they
could
not
help
retaining
a
certain
amount
of
vitality
and
flexibility
but
the
community
always
instructs
its
new
members
as
to
its
way
of
disposing
of
these
cases
before
they
present
themselves
ideas
are
proffered
in
other
words
separated
from
present
doubt
and
remote
from
application
in
order
to
escape
future
difficulties
and
the
need
of
any
thinking
in
primitive
communities
this
is
the
main
purport
of
instruction
and
it
remains
such
to
a
very
considerable
degree
there
is
a
prejudgment
rather
than
judgment
proper
when
the
community
uses
its
resources
to
fix
certain
ideas
in
the
mind
that
is
certain
ways
of
interpreting
and
regarding
experience
ideas
are
necessarily
formulated
so
as
to
assume
a
rigid
and
independent
form
they
are
doubly
removed
from
the
sphere
of
doubt
the
attitude
is
uncritical
and
dogmatic
in
the
extreme
so
much
so
that
one
might
question
whether
it
is
to
be
properly
designated
as
a
stage
of
thinking
in
this
form
ideas
become
the
chief
instruments
of
social
conservation
judicial
decision
and
penal
correction
are
restricted
and
ineffective
methods
of
maintaining
social
institutions
unchanged
compared
with
instilling
in
advance
uniform
ideas
fixed
modes
of
appraising
all
social
questions
and
issues
these
set
ideas
thus
become
the
embodiment
of
the
values
which
any
group
has
realized
and
intends
to
perpetuate
the
fixation
supports
them
against
dissipation
through
attrition
of
circumstance
and
against
destruction
through
hostile
attack
it
would
be
interesting
to
follow
out
the
ways
in
which
such
values
are
put
under
the
protection
of
the
gods
and
of
religious
rites
or
themselves
erected
into
as
among
the
romans
this
however
would
hardly
add
anything
to
the
logic
of
the
discussion
although
it
would
indicate
the
importance
attached
to
the
fixation
of
ideas
and
the
thoroughgoing
character
of
the
means
used
to
secure
immobilization
the
conserving
value
of
the
dogmatic
attitude
the
point
of
view
which
takes
ideas
as
fixed
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
society
has
no
methods
of
science
for
protecting
and
perpetuating
its
achieved
values
there
is
practically
no
other
resort
than
such
crystallization
moreover
with
any
possible
scientific
progress
some
equivalent
of
the
fixed
idea
must
remain
the
nearer
we
get
to
the
needs
of
action
the
greater
absoluteness
must
attach
to
ideas
the
necessities
of
action
do
not
await
our
convenience
emergencies
continually
present
themselves
where
the
fixity
required
for
successful
activity
can
not
be
attained
through
the
medium
of
investigation
the
alternative
to
vacillation
confusion
and
futility
of
action
is
importation
to
ideas
of
a
positive
and
secured
character
not
in
strict
logic
belonging
to
them
it
is
this
sort
of
determination
that
hegel
seems
to
have
in
mind
in
what
he
terms
the
understanding
apart
from
he
says
there
is
no
fixity
or
accuracy
in
the
region
either
of
theory
or
practice
and
again
sticks
to
fixity
of
characters
and
their
distinctions
from
one
another
it
treats
every
meaning
as
having
a
subsistence
of
its
own
in
technical
terminology
also
this
is
what
is
meant
by
positing
ideas
hardening
meanings
in
recognizing
however
that
fixation
of
intellectual
content
is
a
precondition
of
effective
action
we
must
not
overlook
the
modification
that
comes
with
the
advance
of
thinking
into
more
critical
forms
at
the
outset
fixity
is
taken
as
the
rightful
possession
of
the
ideas
themselves
it
belongs
to
them
and
is
their
essence
as
the
scientific
spirit
develops
we
see
that
it
is
we
who
lend
fixity
to
the
ideas
and
that
this
loan
is
for
a
purpose
to
which
the
meaning
of
the
ideas
is
accommodated
fixity
ceases
to
be
a
matter
of
intrinsic
structure
of
ideas
and
becomes
an
affair
of
security
in
using
them
hence
the
important
thing
is
the
in
which
we
fix
the
idea
the
manner
of
the
inquiry
which
results
in
definition
we
the
idea
as
if
it
were
fixed
in
order
to
secure
the
necessary
stability
of
action
the
crisis
past
the
idea
drops
its
borrowed
investiture
and
reappears
as
surmise
when
we
substitute
for
ideas
as
uniform
rules
by
which
to
decide
doubtful
cases
that
making
over
of
ideas
which
is
requisite
to
make
them
fit
the
quality
of
thought
alters
we
may
fairly
say
that
we
have
come
into
another
stage
the
idea
is
now
regarded
as
essentially
subject
to
change
as
a
manufactured
article
needing
to
be
made
ready
for
use
to
determine
the
conditions
of
this
transition
lies
beyond
my
purpose
since
i
have
in
mind
only
a
descriptive
setting
forth
of
the
periods
through
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
thought
has
passed
in
the
development
of
the
inquiry
function
without
raising
the
problem
of
its
why
and
how
at
this
point
we
shall
not
do
more
than
note
that
as
the
scheduled
stock
of
fixed
ideas
grows
larger
their
application
to
specific
questions
becomes
more
difficult
prolonged
and
roundabout
there
has
to
be
a
definite
hunting
for
the
specific
idea
which
is
appropriate
there
has
to
be
comparison
of
it
with
other
ideas
this
comes
to
involve
a
certain
amount
of
mutual
compromise
and
modification
before
selection
is
possible
the
idea
thus
gets
somewhat
shaken
it
has
to
be
made
over
so
that
it
may
harmonize
with
other
ideas
possessing
equal
worth
often
the
very
accumulation
of
fixed
ideas
commands
this
reconstruction
the
dead
weight
of
the
material
becomes
so
great
that
it
can
not
sustain
itself
without
a
readjustment
of
the
center
of
gravity
simplification
and
systematization
are
required
and
these
call
for
reflection
critical
cases
come
up
in
which
the
fiction
of
an
idea
or
rule
already
in
existence
can
not
be
maintained
it
is
impossible
to
conceal
that
old
ideas
have
to
be
radically
modified
before
the
situation
can
be
dealt
with
the
friction
of
circumstance
melts
away
their
congealed
fixity
judgment
becomes
legislative
seeking
illustrations
at
large
we
find
this
change
typified
in
hebrew
history
in
the
growing
importance
of
the
prophet
over
the
judge
in
the
transition
from
a
justification
of
conduct
through
bringing
particular
cases
into
conformity
with
existent
laws
into
that
effected
by
personal
enabling
the
individual
to
see
the
law
in
each
case
for
himself
profoundly
as
this
changed
conception
of
the
relation
between
law
and
particular
case
affected
moral
life
it
did
not
among
semites
directly
influence
the
logical
sphere
with
the
greeks
however
we
find
a
continuous
and
marked
departure
from
positive
declaration
of
custom
we
have
assemblies
meeting
to
discuss
and
dispute
and
finally
upon
the
basis
of
the
considerations
thus
brought
to
view
to
decide
the
man
of
counsel
is
set
side
by
side
with
the
man
of
deed
odysseus
was
much
experienced
not
only
because
he
knew
the
customs
and
ways
of
old
but
even
more
because
from
the
richness
of
his
experience
he
could
make
the
pregnant
suggestion
to
meet
the
new
crisis
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
it
was
the
emphasis
put
by
the
greek
mind
upon
discussion
at
first
as
preliminary
to
decision
and
afterward
to
legislation
which
generated
logical
theory
discussion
is
thus
an
apt
name
for
this
attitude
of
thought
it
is
bringing
various
beliefs
together
shaking
one
against
another
and
tearing
down
their
rigidity
it
is
conversation
of
thoughts
it
is
dialogue
the
mother
of
dialectic
in
more
than
the
etymological
sense
no
process
is
more
recurrent
in
history
than
the
transfer
of
operations
carried
on
between
different
persons
into
the
arena
of
the
individual
own
consciousness
the
discussion
which
at
first
took
place
by
bringing
ideas
from
different
persons
into
contact
by
introducing
them
into
the
forum
of
competition
and
by
subjecting
them
to
critical
comparison
and
selective
decision
finally
became
a
habit
of
the
individual
with
himself
he
became
a
miniature
social
assemblage
in
which
pros
and
cons
were
brought
into
play
struggling
for
the
mastery
for
final
conclusion
in
some
such
way
we
conceive
reflection
to
be
born
it
is
evident
that
discussion
the
agitation
of
ideas
if
judged
from
the
standpoint
of
the
older
fixed
ideas
is
a
destructive
process
ideas
are
not
only
shaken
together
and
apart
they
are
so
shaken
in
themselves
that
their
whole
validity
becomes
doubtful
mind
and
not
merely
beliefs
becomes
uncertain
the
attempt
to
harmonize
different
ideas
means
that
in
themselves
they
are
discrepant
the
search
for
a
conclusion
means
that
accepted
ideas
are
only
points
of
view
and
hence
personal
affairs
needless
to
say
it
was
the
sophists
who
emphasized
and
generalized
this
negative
aspect
this
presupposition
of
loss
of
assurance
of
inconsistency
of
subjectivity
they
took
it
as
applying
not
only
to
this
that
and
the
other
idea
but
to
ideas
as
ideas
since
ideas
are
no
longer
fixed
contents
they
are
just
expressions
of
an
individual
way
of
thinking
lacking
inherent
value
they
merely
express
the
interests
that
induce
the
individual
to
look
this
way
rather
than
that
they
are
made
by
the
point
of
view
and
hence
will
be
unmade
if
he
can
be
led
to
change
his
point
of
view
where
all
was
fixity
now
all
is
instability
where
all
was
certitude
nothing
now
exists
save
opinion
based
on
prejudice
interest
or
arbitrary
choice
the
modern
point
of
view
while
condemning
sophistry
yet
often
agrees
with
it
in
limiting
the
reflective
attitude
as
such
to
and
from
bacon
down
the
appeal
is
to
observation
to
attention
to
facts
to
concern
with
the
external
world
the
sole
genuine
guaranty
of
truth
is
taken
to
be
appeal
to
facts
and
thinking
as
such
is
something
different
if
reflection
is
not
considered
to
be
merely
variable
matter
it
is
considered
to
be
at
least
an
endless
mulling
over
of
things
it
is
the
futile
attempt
to
spin
truth
out
of
inner
consciousness
it
is
introspection
and
theorizing
and
mere
speculation
such
wholesale
depreciation
ignores
the
value
inherent
even
in
the
most
subjective
reflection
for
it
takes
the
settled
estate
which
is
proof
that
thought
is
not
needed
or
that
it
has
done
its
work
as
if
it
supplied
the
standard
for
the
occasions
in
which
problems
are
hard
upon
us
and
doubt
is
rife
it
takes
the
conditions
which
come
about
after
and
because
we
have
thought
to
measure
the
conditions
which
call
out
thinking
whenever
we
really
need
to
reflect
we
can
not
appeal
directly
to
the
fact
for
the
adequate
reason
that
the
stimulus
to
thinking
arises
just
because
facts
have
slipped
away
from
us
the
fallacy
is
neatly
committed
by
mill
in
his
discussion
of
account
of
the
need
of
mental
conception
or
hypothesis
in
colligating
facts
he
insists
that
the
conception
is
obtained
from
the
facts
in
which
it
exists
is
impressed
upon
us
from
without
and
also
that
it
is
the
darkness
and
confusion
of
the
facts
that
make
us
want
the
conception
in
order
to
create
light
and
order
reflection
involves
running
over
various
ideas
sorting
them
out
comparing
one
with
another
trying
to
get
one
which
will
unite
in
itself
the
strength
of
two
searching
for
new
points
of
view
developing
new
suggestions
guessing
suggesting
selecting
and
rejecting
the
greater
the
problem
and
the
greater
the
shock
of
doubt
and
resultant
confusion
and
uncertainty
the
more
prolonged
and
more
necessary
is
the
process
of
mere
thinking
it
is
a
more
obvious
phase
of
biology
than
of
physics
of
sociology
than
of
chemistry
but
it
persists
in
established
sciences
if
we
take
even
a
mathematical
proposition
not
it
has
been
demonstrated
and
is
thus
capable
of
statement
in
adequate
logical
form
but
while
in
process
of
discovery
and
proof
the
operation
of
this
subjective
phase
is
manifest
so
much
so
indeed
that
a
distinguished
modern
mathematician
has
said
that
the
paths
which
the
mathematical
inquirer
traverses
in
any
new
field
are
more
akin
to
those
of
the
experimentalist
and
even
to
those
of
the
poet
and
artist
than
to
those
of
the
euclidean
geometer
what
makes
the
essential
difference
between
modern
research
and
the
reflection
of
say
the
greeks
is
not
the
absence
of
mere
thinking
but
the
presence
of
conditions
for
testing
its
results
the
elaborate
system
of
checks
and
balances
found
in
the
technique
of
modern
experimentation
the
thinking
process
does
not
now
go
on
endlessly
in
terms
of
itself
but
seeks
outlet
through
reference
to
particular
experiences
it
is
tested
by
this
reference
not
however
as
if
a
theory
could
be
tested
by
directly
comparing
it
with
facts
an
obvious
impossibility
but
through
use
in
facilitating
commerce
with
facts
it
is
tested
as
glasses
are
tested
things
are
looked
at
through
the
medium
of
specific
meanings
to
see
if
thereby
they
assume
a
more
orderly
and
clearer
aspect
if
they
are
less
blurred
and
obscure
the
reaction
of
the
socratic
school
against
the
sophistic
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
third
stage
of
thinking
this
movement
was
not
interested
in
the
shaking
of
received
ideas
and
a
discrediting
of
all
thinking
it
was
concerned
rather
with
the
virtual
appeal
to
a
common
denominator
involved
in
bringing
different
ideas
into
relation
with
one
another
in
their
comparison
and
mutual
modification
it
saw
evidence
of
the
operation
of
a
standard
permanent
meaning
passing
judgment
upon
their
conflict
and
revealing
a
common
principle
and
standard
of
reference
it
dealt
not
with
the
shaking
and
dissolution
but
with
a
comprehensive
permanent
idea
finally
to
emerge
controversy
and
discussion
among
different
individuals
may
result
in
extending
doubt
manifesting
the
incoherency
of
accepted
ideas
and
so
throwing
an
individual
into
an
attitude
of
distrust
but
it
also
involves
an
appeal
to
a
single
thought
to
be
accepted
by
both
parties
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
dispute
this
appeal
to
a
higher
court
this
possibility
of
attaining
a
total
and
abiding
intellectual
object
which
should
bring
into
relief
the
agreeing
elements
in
contending
thoughts
and
banish
the
incompatible
factors
animated
the
socratic
search
for
the
concept
the
elaboration
of
the
platonic
hierarchy
of
ideas
in
which
the
higher
substantiate
the
lower
and
the
aristotelian
exposition
of
the
systematized
methods
by
which
general
truths
may
be
employed
to
prove
propositions
otherwise
doubtful
at
least
this
historic
development
will
serve
to
illustrate
what
is
involved
in
the
transition
from
the
second
to
the
third
stage
the
transformation
of
discussion
into
reasoning
of
subjective
reflection
into
method
of
proof
discussion
whether
with
ourselves
or
others
goes
on
by
suggestion
of
clues
as
the
uppermost
object
of
interest
opens
a
way
here
or
there
it
is
discursive
and
haphazard
this
gives
it
the
devious
tendency
indicated
in
plato
remark
that
it
needs
to
be
tied
to
the
post
of
reason
it
needs
that
is
to
have
the
ground
or
basis
of
its
various
component
statements
brought
to
consciousness
in
such
a
way
as
to
define
the
exact
value
of
each
the
socratic
contention
is
the
need
of
compelling
the
common
denominator
the
common
subject
underlying
the
diversity
of
views
to
exhibit
itself
it
alone
gives
a
sure
standard
by
which
the
claims
of
all
assertions
may
be
measured
until
this
need
is
met
discussion
is
a
play
with
unjudged
unexamined
matters
which
confused
and
shifting
impose
themselves
upon
us
we
are
familiar
enough
with
the
theory
that
the
socratic
universal
the
platonic
idea
was
generated
by
an
ignorant
transformation
of
psychological
abstractions
into
entities
to
insist
upon
this
as
the
key
to
the
socratic
logic
is
mere
caricature
the
objectivity
of
the
universal
stood
for
the
sense
of
something
decisive
and
controlling
in
all
reflection
which
otherwise
is
just
manipulation
of
personal
prejudices
this
sense
is
as
active
in
modern
science
as
it
was
in
the
platonic
dialectic
what
socrates
felt
was
the
opinionated
conceited
quality
of
the
terms
used
in
the
moral
and
political
discussion
of
his
day
as
that
contrasted
with
the
which
if
rightly
grasped
would
put
an
end
to
mere
views
and
argumentations
by
aristotle
time
the
interest
was
not
so
much
in
the
existence
of
standards
of
decision
in
cases
of
doubt
and
dispute
as
in
the
technique
of
their
use
the
judge
was
firmly
seated
on
the
bench
the
parties
in
controversy
recognized
his
jurisdiction
and
their
respective
claims
were
submitted
for
adjudicature
the
need
was
for
rules
of
procedure
by
which
the
judge
might
in
an
obvious
and
impartial
way
bring
the
recognized
universal
or
decisive
law
to
bear
upon
particular
matters
hence
the
elaboration
of
those
rules
of
evidence
those
canons
of
demonstrative
force
which
are
the
backbone
of
the
aristotelian
logic
there
was
a
code
by
which
to
decide
upon
the
admissibility
and
value
of
proffered
testimony
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
the
figures
and
terms
of
the
syllogism
provided
a
scheme
for
deciding
upon
the
exact
bearing
of
every
statement
propounded
the
plan
of
arrangement
of
major
and
minor
premises
of
major
minor
and
middle
terms
furnished
a
manifesto
of
the
exact
procedure
to
be
followed
in
determining
the
probative
force
of
each
element
in
reasoning
the
judge
knew
what
testimony
to
permit
when
and
how
it
should
be
introduced
how
it
could
be
impeached
or
have
its
competence
lessened
and
how
the
evidence
was
to
be
arranged
so
that
a
summary
would
also
be
an
exhibit
of
its
value
in
establishing
a
conclusion
this
means
that
there
now
is
a
distinctive
type
of
thinking
marked
off
from
mere
discussion
and
reflection
it
may
be
called
either
reasoning
or
proof
it
is
reasoning
when
we
think
of
the
regularity
of
the
method
for
getting
at
and
employing
the
unquestioned
grounds
which
give
validity
to
other
statements
it
is
proof
as
regards
the
degree
of
logical
desert
thereby
measured
out
to
such
propositions
proof
is
the
acceptance
or
rejection
justified
through
the
reasoning
to
quote
from
mill
to
give
credence
to
a
proposition
as
a
conclusion
from
something
else
is
to
reason
in
the
most
extensive
sense
of
the
term
we
say
of
a
fact
or
statement
it
is
proved
when
we
believe
its
truth
by
reason
of
some
other
fact
or
statement
from
which
it
is
said
to
follow
reasoning
is
marshaling
a
series
of
terms
and
propositions
until
we
can
bind
some
doubtful
fact
firmly
to
an
unquestioned
although
remote
truth
it
is
the
regular
way
in
which
a
certain
proposition
is
brought
to
bear
on
a
precarious
one
clothing
the
latter
with
something
of
the
peremptory
quality
of
the
former
so
far
as
we
reach
this
result
and
so
far
as
we
can
exhibit
each
step
in
the
nexus
and
be
sure
it
has
been
rightly
performed
we
have
proof
but
questions
still
face
us
how
about
that
truth
upon
which
we
fall
back
as
guaranteeing
the
credibility
of
other
statements
how
about
our
major
premise
whence
does
it
derive
its
guaranty
custodes
custodiet
we
may
of
course
in
turn
subsume
it
under
some
further
major
premise
but
an
infinite
regress
is
impossible
and
on
this
track
we
are
finally
left
hanging
in
the
air
for
purposes
the
unquestioned
principle
may
be
taken
as
signifying
mutual
concession
or
agreement
it
denotes
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
truth
is
not
called
in
question
by
the
parties
concerned
this
does
admirably
for
settling
arguments
and
controversies
it
is
a
good
way
of
amicably
arranging
matters
among
those
already
friends
and
but
scientifically
the
widespread
acceptance
of
an
idea
seems
to
testify
to
custom
rather
than
to
truth
prejudice
is
strengthened
in
influence
but
hardly
in
value
by
the
number
who
share
it
conceit
is
none
the
less
because
it
turns
the
heads
of
many
great
interest
was
indeed
afterward
taken
in
the
range
of
persons
who
hold
truths
in
common
the
semper
ubique
became
of
great
importance
this
however
was
not
in
theory
at
least
because
common
agreement
was
supposed
to
constitute
the
major
premise
but
because
it
afforded
confirmatory
evidence
of
its
and
universal
character
hence
the
aristotelian
logic
necessarily
assumes
certain
first
or
fundamental
truths
unquestioned
and
unquestionable
and
neither
established
nor
modified
by
thought
but
standing
firm
in
their
own
right
this
assumption
was
not
as
modern
dealers
in
formal
logic
would
sometimes
have
it
an
external
psychological
or
metaphysical
attachment
to
the
theory
of
reasoning
to
be
omitted
at
will
from
logic
as
such
it
was
an
essential
factor
of
knowledge
that
there
should
be
necessary
propositions
directly
apprehended
by
reason
and
particular
ones
directly
apprehended
by
sense
reasoning
could
then
join
them
without
the
truths
we
have
only
the
play
of
subjective
arbitrary
futile
opinion
has
not
taken
place
and
assertion
is
without
warrant
hence
the
scheduling
of
first
truths
is
an
organic
part
of
any
reasoning
which
is
occupied
with
securing
demonstration
surety
of
assent
or
valid
conviction
to
deny
the
necessary
place
of
ultimate
truths
in
the
logical
system
of
aristotle
and
his
followers
is
to
make
them
players
in
a
game
of
social
convention
it
is
to
overlook
to
invert
the
fact
that
they
were
sincerely
concerned
with
the
question
of
attaining
the
grounds
and
process
of
assurance
hence
they
were
obliged
to
assume
primary
intuitions
metaphysical
physical
moral
and
mathematical
axioms
in
order
to
get
the
pegs
of
certainty
to
which
to
tie
the
bundles
of
otherwise
contingent
propositions
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
claim
that
the
regard
for
the
authority
of
the
church
of
the
fathers
of
the
scriptures
of
ancient
writers
of
aristotle
himself
so
characteristic
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
direct
outcome
of
this
presupposition
of
truths
fixed
and
unquestionable
in
themselves
but
the
logical
connection
is
sure
the
supply
of
absolute
premises
that
aristotle
was
able
to
proffer
was
scant
in
his
own
generation
and
situation
this
paucity
made
comparatively
little
difference
for
to
the
mass
of
men
the
great
bulk
of
values
was
still
carried
by
custom
by
religious
belief
and
social
institution
it
was
only
in
the
comparatively
small
sphere
of
persons
who
had
come
under
the
philosophic
influence
that
need
for
the
logical
mode
of
confirmation
was
felt
in
the
mediaeval
period
however
all
important
beliefs
required
to
be
concentrated
by
some
fixed
principle
giving
them
stay
and
power
for
they
were
contrary
to
obvious
and
natural
tradition
the
situation
was
exactly
such
as
to
call
into
active
use
the
aristotelian
scheme
of
thought
authority
supplemented
the
meagerness
of
the
store
of
universals
known
by
direct
intuition
the
aristotelian
plan
of
reasoning
afforded
the
precise
instrumentality
through
which
the
vague
and
chaotic
details
of
life
could
be
reduced
to
order
by
subjecting
them
to
authoritative
rules
it
is
not
enough
however
to
account
for
the
ultimate
major
premises
for
the
unconditioned
grounds
upon
which
credibility
is
assigned
we
have
also
to
report
where
the
other
side
comes
from
matters
so
uncertain
in
themselves
as
to
require
that
they
have
their
grounds
supplied
from
outside
the
answer
in
the
aristotelian
scheme
is
an
obvious
one
it
is
the
very
nature
of
sense
of
ordinary
experience
to
supply
us
with
matters
which
in
themselves
are
only
contingent
there
is
a
certain
portion
of
the
intellectual
sphere
that
derived
from
experience
which
is
infected
throughout
by
its
unworthy
origin
it
stands
forever
condemned
to
be
merely
empirical
particular
more
or
less
accidental
inherently
irrational
you
can
not
make
gold
from
dross
and
the
best
that
can
be
done
for
and
with
material
of
this
sort
is
to
bring
it
under
the
protection
of
truth
which
has
warrant
and
weight
in
itself
we
may
now
characterize
this
stage
of
thinking
with
reference
to
our
original
remark
that
different
stages
denote
various
degrees
in
the
evolution
of
the
function
as
compared
with
the
period
of
fixed
ideas
doubt
is
awake
and
inquiry
is
active
but
in
itself
it
is
rigidly
limited
on
one
side
it
is
bounded
by
fixed
ultimate
truths
whose
very
nature
is
that
they
can
not
be
doubted
which
are
not
products
or
functions
in
inquiry
but
bases
that
investigation
fortunately
rests
upon
in
the
other
direction
all
matters
of
fact
all
empirical
truths
belong
to
a
particular
sphere
or
kind
of
existence
and
one
intrinsically
open
to
suspicion
the
region
is
condemned
in
a
wholesale
way
in
itself
it
exhales
doubt
it
can
not
be
reformed
it
is
to
be
shunned
or
if
this
is
not
possible
to
be
escaped
from
by
climbing
up
a
ladder
of
intermediate
terms
until
we
lay
hold
on
the
universal
the
very
way
in
which
doubt
is
objectified
taken
all
in
a
piece
marks
its
lack
of
vitality
it
is
arrested
and
cooped
up
in
a
particular
place
as
with
any
doubtful
character
the
less
of
its
company
the
better
uncertainty
is
not
realized
as
a
necessary
instrument
in
compelling
experienced
matters
to
reveal
their
meaning
and
inherent
order
this
limitation
upon
inquiry
settles
the
interpretation
to
be
given
thought
at
this
stage
it
is
of
necessity
merely
connective
merely
mediating
it
goes
between
the
first
principles
themselves
as
to
their
validity
outside
the
province
of
thought
and
the
particulars
of
sense
also
as
to
their
status
and
worth
beyond
the
dominion
of
thought
thinking
is
subsumption
just
placing
a
particular
proposition
under
its
universal
it
is
inclusion
finding
a
place
for
some
questioned
matter
within
a
region
taken
as
more
certain
it
is
use
of
general
truths
to
afford
support
to
things
otherwise
shaky
an
application
that
improves
their
standing
while
leaving
their
content
unchanged
this
means
that
thought
has
only
a
formal
value
it
is
of
service
in
exhibiting
and
arranging
grounds
upon
which
any
particular
proposition
may
be
acquitted
or
condemned
upon
which
anything
already
current
may
be
assented
to
or
upon
which
belief
may
reasonably
be
withheld
the
metaphor
of
the
law
court
is
apt
there
is
assumed
some
matter
to
be
either
proved
or
disproved
as
matter
as
content
it
is
furnished
it
is
not
to
be
found
out
in
the
law
court
it
is
not
a
question
of
discovering
what
a
man
specifically
is
but
simply
of
finding
reasons
for
regarding
him
as
guilty
or
innocent
there
is
no
play
of
thought
directed
to
the
institution
of
something
as
fact
but
a
question
of
whether
grounds
can
be
adduced
justifying
acceptance
of
some
proposition
already
set
forth
the
significance
of
such
an
attitude
comes
into
relief
when
we
contrast
it
with
what
is
done
in
the
laboratory
in
the
laboratory
there
is
no
question
of
proving
that
things
are
just
thus
and
so
or
that
we
must
accept
or
reject
a
given
statement
there
is
simply
an
interest
in
finding
out
what
sort
of
things
we
are
dealing
with
any
quality
or
change
that
presents
itself
may
be
an
object
of
investigation
or
may
suggest
a
conclusion
for
it
is
judged
not
by
reference
to
truths
but
by
its
suggestiveness
by
what
it
may
lead
to
the
mind
is
open
to
inquiry
in
any
direction
or
we
may
illustrate
by
the
difference
between
the
auditor
and
an
actuary
in
an
insurance
company
one
simply
passes
and
rejects
issues
vouchers
compares
and
balances
statements
already
made
out
the
other
investigates
any
one
of
the
items
of
expense
or
receipt
inquires
how
it
comes
to
be
what
it
is
what
facts
as
regards
say
length
of
life
condition
of
money
market
activity
of
agents
are
involved
and
what
further
researches
and
activities
are
indicated
the
illustrations
of
the
laboratory
and
the
expert
remind
us
of
another
attitude
of
thought
in
which
investigation
attacks
matters
hitherto
reserved
the
growth
for
example
of
freedom
of
thought
during
the
renaissance
was
a
revelation
of
the
intrinsic
momentum
of
the
itself
it
was
not
a
mere
reaction
from
and
against
mediaeval
scholasticism
it
was
the
continued
operation
of
the
machinery
which
the
scholastics
had
set
doubt
and
inquiry
were
extended
into
the
region
of
particulars
of
matters
of
fact
with
the
view
of
reconstituting
them
through
discovery
of
their
own
structure
no
longer
with
the
intention
of
leaving
that
unchanged
while
transforming
their
claim
to
credence
by
connecting
them
with
some
authoritative
principles
thought
no
longer
found
satisfaction
in
appraising
them
in
a
scale
of
values
according
to
their
nearness
to
or
remoteness
from
fixed
truths
such
work
had
been
done
to
a
nicety
and
it
was
futile
to
repeat
it
thinking
must
find
a
new
outlet
it
was
out
of
employment
and
set
to
discover
new
lands
galileo
and
copernicus
were
travelers
as
much
so
as
the
crusader
marco
polo
and
columbus
hence
the
fourth
stage
covering
what
is
popularly
known
as
inductive
and
empirical
science
thought
takes
the
form
of
inference
instead
of
proof
proof
as
we
have
already
seen
is
accepting
or
rejecting
a
given
proposition
on
the
ground
of
its
connection
or
lack
of
connection
with
some
other
proposition
conceded
or
established
but
inference
does
not
terminate
in
any
given
proposition
it
is
after
precisely
those
not
given
it
wants
more
facts
different
facts
thinking
in
the
mode
of
inference
insists
upon
terminating
in
an
intellectual
advance
in
a
consciousness
of
truths
hitherto
escaping
us
our
thinking
must
not
now
pass
certain
propositions
after
challenging
them
must
not
admit
them
because
they
exhibit
certain
credentials
showing
a
right
to
be
received
into
the
upper
circle
of
intellectual
society
thinking
endeavors
to
compel
things
as
they
present
themselves
to
yield
up
something
hitherto
obscure
or
concealed
this
advance
and
extension
of
knowledge
through
thinking
seems
to
be
well
designated
by
the
term
inference
it
does
not
certify
what
is
otherwise
doubtful
but
goes
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
it
aims
at
pushing
out
the
frontiers
of
knowledge
not
at
marking
those
already
attained
with
signposts
its
technique
is
not
a
scheme
for
assigning
status
to
beliefs
already
possessed
but
is
a
method
for
making
friends
with
facts
and
ideas
hitherto
alien
inference
reaches
out
fills
in
gaps
its
work
is
measured
not
by
the
patents
of
standing
it
issues
but
by
the
material
increments
of
knowledge
it
yields
is
more
important
than
discovery
than
proof
with
the
development
of
empirical
research
uncertainty
or
contingency
is
no
longer
regarded
as
infecting
in
a
wholesale
way
an
entire
region
discrediting
it
save
as
it
can
be
brought
under
the
protecting
aegis
of
universal
truths
as
major
premises
uncertainty
is
now
a
matter
of
detail
it
is
the
question
whether
the
particular
fact
is
really
what
it
has
been
taken
to
be
it
involves
contrast
not
of
a
fact
as
a
fixed
particular
over
against
some
fixed
universal
but
of
the
existing
mode
of
apprehension
with
another
possible
better
apprehension
from
the
standpoint
of
reasoning
and
proof
the
intellectual
field
is
absolutely
measured
out
in
advance
certainty
is
located
in
one
part
intellectual
indeterminateness
or
uncertainty
in
another
but
when
thinking
becomes
research
when
the
function
comes
to
its
own
the
problem
is
just
what
is
the
fact
hence
the
extreme
interest
in
details
as
such
in
observing
collecting
and
comparing
particular
causes
in
analysis
of
structure
down
to
its
constituent
elements
interest
in
atoms
cells
and
in
all
matters
of
arrangement
in
space
and
time
the
microscope
telescope
and
spectroscope
the
scalpel
and
microtome
the
kymograph
and
the
camera
are
not
mere
material
appendages
to
thinking
they
are
as
integral
parts
of
investigative
thought
as
were
of
the
logic
of
reasoning
facts
must
be
discovered
and
to
accomplish
this
apparent
facts
must
be
resolved
into
their
elements
things
must
be
readjusted
in
order
to
be
held
free
from
intrusion
of
impertinent
circumstance
and
misleading
suggestion
instrumentalities
of
extending
and
rectifying
research
are
therefore
of
themselves
organs
of
thinking
the
specialization
of
the
sciences
the
almost
daily
birth
of
a
new
science
is
a
logical
necessity
not
a
mere
historical
episode
every
phase
of
experience
must
be
investigated
and
each
characteristic
aspect
presents
its
own
peculiar
problems
which
demand
therefore
their
own
technique
of
investigation
the
discovery
of
difficulties
the
substitution
of
doubt
for
quiescent
acceptance
are
more
important
than
the
sanctioning
of
belief
through
proof
hence
the
importance
of
noting
apparent
exceptions
negative
instances
extreme
cases
anomalies
the
interest
is
in
the
discrepant
because
that
stimulates
inquiry
not
in
the
fixed
universal
which
would
terminate
it
once
for
all
hence
the
roaming
over
the
earth
and
through
the
skies
for
new
facts
which
may
be
incompatible
with
old
theories
and
which
may
suggest
new
points
of
view
to
illustrate
these
matters
in
detail
would
be
to
write
the
history
of
every
modern
science
the
interest
in
multiplying
phenomena
in
increasing
the
area
of
facts
in
developing
new
distinctions
of
quantity
structure
and
form
is
obviously
characteristic
of
modern
science
but
we
do
not
always
heed
its
logical
significance
that
it
makes
thinking
to
consist
in
the
extension
and
control
of
contact
with
new
material
so
as
to
lead
regularly
to
the
development
of
new
experience
the
elevation
of
the
region
of
facts
the
formerly
condemned
region
of
the
inherently
contingent
and
variable
to
something
that
invites
and
rewards
inquiry
defines
the
import
therefore
of
the
larger
aspects
of
modern
science
this
spirit
prides
itself
upon
being
positivistic
it
deals
with
the
observed
and
the
observable
it
will
have
naught
to
do
with
ideas
that
can
not
verify
themselves
by
showing
themselves
propria
it
is
not
enough
to
present
credentials
from
more
sovereign
truths
these
are
hardly
acceptable
even
as
letters
of
introduction
refutation
of
newton
claim
that
he
did
not
make
hypotheses
by
pointing
out
that
no
one
was
busier
in
this
direction
than
he
and
that
scientific
power
is
generally
in
direct
ratio
to
ability
to
imagine
possibilities
is
as
easy
as
it
is
irrelevant
the
hypotheses
the
thoughts
that
newton
employed
were
of
and
about
fact
they
were
for
the
sake
of
exacting
and
extending
what
can
be
apprehended
instead
of
being
sacrosanct
truths
affording
a
redemption
by
grace
to
facts
otherwise
ambiguous
they
were
the
articulating
of
ordinary
facts
hence
the
notion
of
law
changes
it
is
no
longer
something
governing
things
and
events
from
on
high
it
is
the
statement
of
their
own
order
thus
the
exiling
of
occult
forces
and
qualities
is
not
so
much
a
specific
achievement
as
it
is
a
demand
of
the
changed
attitude
when
thinking
consists
in
the
detection
and
determination
of
observable
detail
forces
forms
qualities
at
large
are
thrown
out
of
employment
they
are
not
so
much
proved
as
rendered
nugatory
disuse
breeds
their
degeneration
when
the
universal
is
but
the
order
of
the
facts
themselves
the
mediating
machinery
disappears
along
with
the

the

world
in
which
each

in

imputed

graduated
ascending

when

out
what

everything
is
any

is
just
as
good
as
its
fellow
the
observable
world
is
a

the
difference
which
makes
a
fact
what
it
is
is
not
an
exclusive
distinction
but
a
matter
of
position
and
quantity
an
affair
of
locality
and
aggregation
traits
which
place
all
facts
upon
the
same
level
since
all
other
observable
facts
also
possess
them
and
are
indeed
conjointly
responsible
for
them
laws

not
edicts
of
a

binding
a

of

otherwise
lawless
they
are
the

in

familiar
language

the

the
emphasis
of
modern
science
upon

flows
from
the

source
interest
is
in

in

in
discovery
inference
is
the
advance
into
the
unknown
the
use
of
the
established
to
win
new
worlds
from
the
void
this
requires
and
employs
regulation
that
is
method
in
procedure
there
can
not
be
a
blind
attack
a
plan
of
campaign
is

hence
the
practical
applications
of
science
the
baconian
knowledge

the
comteian
science
is
prevision
are
not
addenda
or
supererogatory

they
are
intrinsic
to
the
logical
method
itself
which
is
just
the
orderly
way
of
approaching
new
experiences
so
as
to
grasp
and
hold
them
the
attitude
of
research
is
necessarily
toward
the
future
the
application
of
science
to
the
practical
affairs
of
life
as
in
the
stationary
engine
or
telephone
does
not
differ
in
principle
from
the
determination
of
of
light
through
the
experimental
control
of
the
laboratory
science
lives
only
in
arranging
for
new
contacts
new
insights
the
school
of
kant
agrees
with
that
of
mill
in
asserting
that
judgment
must
in
order
to
be
judgment
be
synthetic
or
instructive
it
must
extend
inform
and
purvey
when
we
recognize
that
this
service
of
judgment
in
effecting
growth
of
experience
is
not
accidental
but
that
judgment
means
exactly
the
devising
and
using
of
suitable
instrumentalities
for
this
end
we
remark
that
the
practical
uses
of
science
are
only
the
further
and
freer
play
of
the
intrinsic
movement
of
discovery
itself
we
began
with
the
assumption
that
thought
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
function
conducted
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
that
mental
equilibrium
known
as
assurance
or
knowledge
we
assumed
that
various
stages
of
thinking
could
be
marked
out
according
to
the
amount
of
play
which
they
give
to
doubt
and
the
consequent
sincerity
with
which
thinking
is
identified
with
free
inquiry
modern
scientific
procedure
as
just
set
forth
seems
to
define
the
ideal
or
limit
of
this
process
it
is
inquiry
emancipated
universalized
whose
sole
aim
and
criterion
is
discovery
and
hence
it
marks
the
terminus
of
our
description
it
is
idle
to
conceal
from
ourselves
however
that
scientific
procedure
as
a
practical
undertaking
has
not
as
yet
reflected
itself
into
any
coherent
and
generally
accepted
theory
of
thinking
into
any
accepted
doctrine
of
logic
which
is
comparable
to
the
aristotelian
kant
conviction
that
logic
is
a
complete
and
settled
science
which
with
absolutely
certain
boundaries
has
gained
nothing
and
lost
nothing
since
aristotle
is
startlingly
contradicted
by
the
existing
state
of
discussion
of
logical
doctrine
the
simple
fact
of
the
case
is
that
there
are
at
least
three
rival
theories
on
the
ground
each
claiming
to
furnish
the
sole
proper
interpretation
of
the
actual
procedure
of
thought
the
aristotelian
logic
is
far
from
having
withdrawn
its
claim
it
still
offers
its
framework
as
that
into
which
the
merely
empirical
results
of
observation
and
experimental
inquiry
must
be
fitted
if
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
really
proved
another
school
of
logicians
starting
professedly
from
modern
psychology
discredits
the
whole
traditional
industry
and
reverses
the
aristotelian
theory
of
validity
it
holds
that
only
particular
facts
are
and
that
the
authority
allowed
to
general
principles
is
derivative
and
second
hand
a
third
school
of
philosophy
claims
by
analysis
of
science
and
experience
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
universe
itself
is
a
construction
of
thought
giving
evidence
throughout
of
the
pervasive
and
constitutive
action
of
reason
and
holds
consequently
that
our
logical
processes
are
simply
the
reading
off
or
coming
to
consciousness
of
the
inherently
rational
structure
already
possessed
by
the
universe
in
virtue
of
the
presence
within
it
of
this
pervasive
and
constitutive
action
of
thought
it
thus
denies
both
the
claim
of
the
traditional
logic
that
matters
of
experienced
fact
are
mere
particulars
having
their
rationality
in
an
external
ground
and
the
claim
of
the
empirical
logic
that
thought
is
just
a
gymnastic
by
which
we
vault
from
one
presented
fact
to
another
remote
in
space
and
time
which
of
the
three
doctrines
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
legitimate
exponent
of
the
procedure
of
thought
manifested
in
modern
science
while
the
aristotelian
logic
is
willing
to
waive
a
claim
to
be
regarded
as
expounder
of
the
actual
procedure
it
still
insists
upon
its
right
to
be
regarded
as
the
sole
ultimate
umpire
of
the
validity
or
character
of
the
results
reached
but
the
empirical
and
transcendental
logics
stand
face
to
face
as
rivals
each
asserting
that
it
alone
tells
the
story
of
what
science
does
and
how
it
does
it
with
the
consciousness
of
this
conflict
my
discussion
in
its
present
or
descriptive
phase
must
cease
its
close
however
suggests
a
further
question
in
so
far
as
we
adopt
the
conception
that
thinking
is
itself
a
process
must
we
not
deny
the
claims
of
all
of
the
three
doctrines
to
be
the
articulate
voicing
of
the
methods
of
experimental
science
do
they
not
all
agree
in
setting
up
something
fixed
outside
inquiry
supplying
both
its
material
and
its
limit
that
the
first
principle
and
the
empirical
matters
of
fact
of
the
aristotelian
logic
fall
outside
the
thinking
process
and
condemn
the
latter
to
a
purely
external
and
agency
has
been
already
sufficiently
descanted
upon
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
fixed
particulars
given
facts
or
sensations
whatever
the
empirical
logician
starts
from
are
material
given
to
the
and
externally
limiting
inquiry
instead
of
being
distinctions
arising
within
and
because
of
search
for
truth
nor
as
regards
this
point
is
the
transcendental
in
any
position
to
throw
stones
at
the
empirical
logic
thought
in
itself
is
so
far
from
a
process
of
inquiry
that
it
is
taken
to
be
the
eternal
fixed
structure
of
the
universe
thinking
involving
doubt
and
investigation
is
due
wholly
to
our
finite
imperfect
character
which
condemns
us
to
the
task
of
merely
imitating
and
reinstating
thought
in
itself
once
and
forever
complete
fixed
the
practical
procedure
and
practical
assumptions
of
modern
experimental
science
since
they
make
thinking
essentially
and
not
merely
accidentally
a
process
of
discovery
seem
irreconcilable
with
both
the
empirical
and
transcendental
interpretations
at
all
events
there
is
here
sufficient
discrepancy
to
give
occasion
for
further
search
does
not
an
account
of
thinking
basing
itself
on
modern
scientific
procedure
demand
a
statement
in
which
all
the
distinctions
and
terms
of
thought
judgment
concept
inference
subject
predicate
and
copula
of
judgment
shall
be
interpreted
simply
and

the

the
logical
character
of
ideas
said
john
stuart
mill
to
draw
inferences
has
been
said
to
be
the
great
business
of
life
it
is
the
only
occupation
in
which
the
mind
never
ceases
to
be
engaged
if
this
be
so
it
seems
a
pity
that
mill
did
not
recognize
that
this
business
identifies
what
we
mean
when
we
say
mind
if
he
had
recognized
this
he
would
have
cast
the
weight
of
his
immense
influence
not
only
against
the
conception
that
mind
is
a
substance
but
also
against
the
conception
that
it
is
a
collection
of
existential
states
or
attributes
without
any
substance
in
which
to
inhere
and
he
would
thereby
have
done
much
to
free
logic
from
epistemological
metaphysics
in
any
case
an
account
of
intellectual
operations
and
conditions
from
the
standpoint
of
the
r√¥le
played
and
position
occupied
by
them
in
the
business
of
drawing
inferences
is
a
different
sort
of
thing
from
an
account
of
them
as
having
an
existence
from
treating
them
as
making
up
some
sort
of
existential
material
distinct
from
the
which
figure
in
this
latter
type
of
treatment
is
that
which
underlies
the
psychology
which
itself
has
adopted
uncritically
the
remnants
of
the
metaphysics
of
soul
substance
the
idea
of
accidents
without
the
substance
this
assumption
from
metaphysical
psychology
the
assumption
of
consciousness
as
an
existent
stuff
or
existent
process
is
then
carried
over
into
an
examination
of
knowledge
so
as
to
make
the
theory
of
knowledge
not
logic
an
account
of
the
ways
in
which
valid
inferences
or
conclusions
from
things
to
other
things
are
made
but
epistemology
we
have
therefore
the
result
so
unfortunate
for
logic
that
logic
is
not
free
to
go
its
own
way
but
is
compromised
by
the
assumption
that
knowledge
goes
on
not
in
terms
of
things
i
use
things
in
the
broadest
sense
as
equaling
and
covering
affairs
concerns
acts
as
well
as
things
in
the
narrower
sense
but
in
terms
of
a
relation
things
and
a
peculiar
existence
made
up
of
consciousness
or
else
between
things
and
functional
operations
of
this
existence
if
it
could
be
shown
that
psychology
is
essentially
not
a
science
of
states
of
consciousness
but
of
behavior
conceived
as
a
process
of
continuous
readjustment
then
the
undoubted
facts
which
go
by
the
name
of
sensation
perception
image
emotion
concept
would
be
interpreted
to
mean
peculiar
specifically
qualitative
epochs
phases
and
crises
in
the
scheme
of
behavior
the
supposedly
scientific
basis
for
the
belief
that
states
of
consciousness
inherently
define
a
separate
type
of
existence
would
be
done
away
with
inferential
knowledge
knowledge
involving
reflection
viewed
would
be
assimilated
to
a
certain
mode
of
readaptation
of
functions
involving
shock
and
the
need
of
control
in
the
sense
of
direct
presence
of
things
would
be
identified
psychologically
with
relatively
stable
or
completed
adjustments
i
can
not
profess
to
speak
for
psychologists
but
it
is
an
obvious
characteristic
of
the
contemporary
status
of
psychology
that
one
school
the
functional
or
dynamic
operates
with
nothing
more
than
a
conventional
and
perfunctory
reference
to
states
of
consciousness
while
the
orthodox
school
makes
constant
concessions
to
ideas
of
the
behavior
type
it
introduces
the
conceptions
of
fatigue
practice
and
habituation
it
makes
its
fundamental
classifications
on
the
basis
of
physiological
distinctions
the
centrally
initiated
and
the
peripherally
initiated
which
from
a
biological
standpoint
are
certainly
distinctions
of
structures
involved
in
the
performance
of
acts
one
of
the
aims
of
the
in
logical
was
to
show
on
the
negative
or
critical
side
that
the
type
of
logical
theory
which
professedly
starts
its
account
of
knowledge
from
mere
states
of
consciousness
is
compelled
at
every
crucial
juncture
to
assume
and
to
define
its
mental
states
in
terms
of
things
and
on
the
positive
side
to
show
that
logically
considered
such
distinctions
as
sensation
image
mark
instruments
and
crises
in
the
development
of
controlled
judgment
of
inferential
conclusions
it
was
perhaps
not
surprising
that
this
effort
should
have
been
criticized
not
on
its
own
merits
but
on
the
assumption
that
this
correspondence
of
the
functional
psychological
and
the
logical
points
of
view
was
intended
in
terms
of
the
psychology
which
obtained
in
the
mind
to
wit
the
psychology
based
on
the
assumption
of
consciousness
as
a
separate
existence
or
process
these
considerations
suggest
that
before
we
can
intelligently
raise
the
question
of
the
truth
of
ideas
we
must
consider
their
status
in
judgment
judgment
being
regarded
as
the
typical
expression
of
the
inferential
operation
do
ideas
present
themselves
except
in
situations
which
are
doubtful
and
inquired
into
do
they
exist
side
by
side
with
the
facts
when
the
facts
are
themselves
known
do
they
exist
except
when
judgment
is
in
suspense
are
ideas
anything
else
except
the
suggestions
conjectures
hypotheses
theories
i
use
an
ascending
scale
of
terms
tentatively
entertained
during
a
suspended
conclusion
do
they
have
any
part
to
play
in
the
conduct
of
inquiry
do
they
serve
to
direct
observation
colligate
data
and
guide
experimentation
or
are
they
otiose
if
the
ideas
have
a
function
in
directing
the
reflective
process
expressed
in
judgment
does
success
in
performing
the
function
that
is
in
directing
to
a
conclusion
which
is
stable
have
anything
to
do
with
the
logical
worth
or
validity
of
the
ideas
and
finally
does
validity
have
anything
to
do
with
truth
does
truth
mean
something
inherently
different
from
the
fact
that
the
conclusion
of
one
judgment
the
known
fact
previously
unknown
in
which
judging
terminates
is
itself
applicable
in
further
situations
of
doubt
and
inquiry
and
is
judgment
properly
more
than
tentative
save
as
it
terminates
in
a
known
fact
a
fact
present
without
the
intermediary
of
reflection
when
these
questions
i
mean
of
course
questions
which
are
exemplified
in
these
queries
are
answered
we
shall
perhaps
have
gone
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
go
with
reference
to
the
character
of
ideas
the
question
may
then
recur
as
to
whether
the
ideas
of
the
epistemologist
that
is
existences
in
a
purely
private
stream
of
consciousness
remain
as
something
over
and
above
not
yet
accounted
for
or
whether
they
are
perversions
and
misrepresentations
of
logical
characters
i
propose
to
give
a
brief
dogmatic
reply
in
the
latter
sense
where
and
in
so
far
as
there
are
unquestioned
objects
there
is
no
consciousness
there
are
just
things
when
there
is
uncertainty
there
are
dubious
suspected
objects
things
hinted
at
guessed
at
such
objects
have
a
distinct
status
and
it
is
the
part
of
good
sense
to
give
them
as
occupying
that
status
a
distinct
caption
consciousness
is
a
term
often
used
for
this
purpose
and
i
see
no
objection
to
that
term
it
is
recognized
to
mean
such
objects
as
are
problematic
plus
the
fact
that
in
their
problematic
character
they
may
be
used
as
effectively
as
accredited
objects
to
direct
observations
and
experiments
which
finally
relieve
the
doubtful
features
of
the
situation
such
objects
may
turn
out
to
be
valid
or
they
may
not
but
in
any
case
they
may
be
used
they
may
be
internally
manipulated
and
developed
through
ratiocination
into
explicit
statement
of
their
implications
they
may
be
employed
as
standpoints
for
selecting
and
arranging
data
and
as
methods
for
conducting
experiments
in
short
they
are
not
merely
hypothetical
they
are
hypotheses
meanwhile
their
aloofness
from
accredited
objectivity
may
lead
us
to
characterize
them
as
merely
ideas
or
even
as
mental
states
provided
once
more
we
mean
by
mental
state
just
this
logical
status
we
have
examples
of
such
ideas
in
symbols
a
symbol
i
take
it
is
always
itself
existentially
a
particular
object
a
word
an
algebraic
sign
is
just
as
much
a
concrete
existence
as
is
a
horse
a
or
a
flyspeck
but
its
value
resides
in
its
representative
character
in
its
suggestive
and
directive
force
for
operations
that
when
performed
lead
us
to
objects
which
without
symbolic
operations
would
not
be
apprehended
or
at
least
would
not
be
so
easily
apprehended
it
is
i
think
worth
noting
that
the
capacity
for
regarding
objects
as
mere
symbols
and
for
employing
symbols
instrumentally
furnishes
the
only
safeguard
against
dogmatism
uncritical
acceptance
of
any
suggestion
that
comes
to
us
vividly
and
also
that
it
furnishes
the
only
basis
for
intelligently
controlled
experiments
i
do
not
think
however
that
we
should
have
the
tendency
to
regard
ideas
as
as
personal
if
we
stopped
short
at
this
point
if
we
had
only
words
or
other
symbols
uttered
by
others
or
written
or
printed
we
might
call
them
when
in
objective
suspense
mere
ideas
but
we
should
hardly
think
of
these
ideas
as
our
own
such
stimuli
however
are
not
adequate
logical
devices
they
are
too
rigid
too
objective
in
their
own
existential
status
their
meaning
and
character
are
too
definitely
fixed
for
effective
discovery
we
need
things
which
are
more
easily
manipulated
which
are
more
transitive
more
easily
dropped
and
changed
events
adjustments
the
organism
that
is
adjustments
of
the
organism
considered
not
with
reference
to
the
environment
but
with
reference
to
one
another
are
much
better
suited
to
stand
as
representatives
of
genuinely
dubious
objects
an
object
which
is
doubted
is
by
its
nature
precarious
and
inchoate
vague
what
a
thing
when
it
is
not
yet
discovered
and
yet
is
tentatively
entertained
and
tested
ancient
logic
never
got
beyond
the
conception
of
an
object
whose
logical
whose
subsumptive
position
as
a
particular
with
reference
to
some
universal
was
doubtful
it
never
got
to
the
point
where
it
could
search
for
particulars
which
in
themselves
as
particulars
are
doubtful
hence
it
was
a
logic
of
proof
of
deduction
not
of
inquiry
of
discovery
and
of
induction
it
was
hard
up
against
its
own
dilemma
how
can
a
man
inquire
for
either
he
knows
that
for
which
he
seeks
and
hence
does
not
seek
or
he
does
not
know
in
which
case
he
can
not
seek
nor
could
he
tell
if
he
found
the
individualistic
movement
of
modern
life
detached
as
it
were
the
individual
and
allowed
personal
events
to
have
transitively
and
temporarily
a
worth
of
their
own
these
events
are
continuous
with
events
in
origin
and
eventual
outcome
but
they
may
be
considered
in
temporary
displacement
as
uniquely
existential
in
this
capacity
they
serve
as
means
for
the
elaboration
of
a
delayed
but
more
adequate
response
in
a
radically
different
direction
so
treated
they
are
tentative
dubious
but
experimental
anticipations
of
an
object
they
are
subjective
individualistic
surrogates
of
public
cosmic
things
which
may
be
so
manipulated
and
elaborated
as
to
terminate
in
public
things
which
without
them
would
not
exist
as
empirical
objects
the
recognition
then
of
events
which
are
not
merely
effects
nor
distorted
refractions
of
cosmic
objects
but
inchoate
cosmic
objects
in
process
of
experimental
construction
resolves
to
my
mind
the
paradox
of
subjective
and
private
things
that
have
objective
and
universal
reference
and
that
operate
so
as
to
lead
to
objective
consequences
which
test
their
own
value
when
a
man
can
say
this
color
is
not
necessarily
the
color
of
the
glass
nor
the
picture
nor
even
of
an
object
reflected
but
is
at
least
an
event
in
my
nervous
system
an
event
which
i
may
refer
to
my
organism
till
i
get
of
other
he
is
for
the
first
time
emancipated
from
the
dogmatism
of
unquestioned
reference
and
is
set
upon
a
path
of
experimental
inquiry
i
am
not
here
concerned
with
trying
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
the
correct
mode
of
interpretation
i
am
only
concerned
with
pointing
out
its
radical
difference
from
the
view
of
a
critic
who
holding
to
the
theory
of
existences
which
from
the
start
are
divided
into
the
fixedly
objective
and
the
fixedly
psychical
interprets
in
terms
of
his
own
theory
the
view
that
the
distinction
between
the
objective
and
the
subjective
is
a
distinction
whether
the
logical
as
against
the
ontological
theory
be
true
or
false
it
can
hardly
be
fruitfully
discussed
without
a
preliminary
apprehension
of
it
as
a
logical
conception
footnotes
this
conception
of
consciousness
as
a
sort
of
reduplicate
world
of
things
comes
to
us
i
think
chiefly
from
hume
conception
that
the
is
nothing
but
a
heap
a
collection
of
different
perceptions
united
together
by
certain
relations
of
human
book
i
part
iv
sec
for
the
evolution
of
this
sort
of
notion
out
of
the
immaterial
substance
notion
see
bush
a
factor
in
the
genesis
of
idealism
in
the
james
see
for
example
thus
that
which
is
but
a
state
of
our
consciousness
turns
out
straightway
to
be
a
specifically
determined
objective
fact
in
a
system
of
facts
and
actual
sensation
is
determined
as
an
event
in
a
world
of
events
when
it
is
said
that
an
idea
is
a
plan
of
action
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
term
plan
of
action
is
a
formal
term
it
throws
no
light
upon
the
action
is
with
respect
to
which
an
idea
is
the
plan
it
may
be
chopping
down
a
tree
finding
a
trail
or
conducting
a
scientific
research
in
mathematics
history
or
chemistry
i
owe
this
idea
both
in
its
historical
and
in
its
logical
aspects
to
my
former
colleague
professor
mead
of
the
university
of
chicago
viii
the
control
of
ideas
by
facts
i
there
is
something
a
little
baffling
in
much
of
the
current
discussion
regarding
the
reference
of
ideas
to
facts
the
not
uncommon
assumption
is
that
there
was
a
satisfactory
and
consistent
theory
of
their
relation
in
existence
prior
to
the
somewhat
impertinent
intrusion
of
a
functional
and
practical
interpretation
of
them
the
way
the
instrumental
logician
has
been
turned
upon
by
both
idealist
and
realist
is
suggestive
of
the
way
in
which
the
outsider
who
intervenes
in
a
family
jar
is
proverbially
treated
by
both
husband
and
wife
who
manifest
their
unity
by
berating
the
third
party
i
feel
that
the
situation
is
due
partly
to
various
misapprehensions
inevitable
perhaps
in
the
first
presentation
of
a
new
point
of
view
and
multiplied
in
this
instance
by
the
coincidence
of
the
presentation
of
this
logical
point
of
view
with
that
of
the
larger
philosophical
movements
humanism
and
pragmatism
i
wish
here
to
undertake
a
summary
statement
of
the
logical
view
on
its
own
account
hoping
it
may
receive
clearer
understanding
on
its
own
merits
in
the
first
place
it
was
apart
from
the
frightful
confusion
of
logical
theories
precisely
the
lack
of
an
adequate
and
generally
accepted
theory
of
the
nature
of
fact
and
idea
and
of
the
kind
of
agreement
or
correspondence
between
them
which
constitutes
the
truth
of
the
idea
that
led
to
the
development
of
a
functional
theory
of
logic
a
brief
statement
of
the
difficulties
in
the
traditional
views
may
therefore
be
pertinent
that
fruitful
thinking
thought
that
terminates
in
valid
knowledge
goes
on
in
terms
of
the
distinction
of
facts
and
judgment
and
that
valid
knowledge
is
precisely
genuine
correspondence
or
agreement
some
of
fact
and
judgment
is
the
common
and
undeniable
assumption
but
the
discussions
are
largely
carried
on
in
terms
of
an
epistemological
dualism
rendering
the
solution
of
the
problem
impossible
in
virtue
of
the
very
terms
in
which
it
is
stated
the
distinction
is
at
once
identified
with
that
between
mind
and
matter
consciousness
and
objects
the
psychical
and
the
physical
where
each
of
these
terms
is
supposed
to
refer
to
some
fixed
order
of
existence
a
world
in
itself
then
of
course
there
comes
up
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
agreement
and
of
the
recognition
of
it
what
is
the
experience
in
which
the
survey
of
both
idea
and
existence
is
made
and
their
agreement
recognized
is
it
an
idea
is
the
agreement
ultimately
a
matter
of
of
ideas
then
what
has
become
of
the
postulate
that
truth
is
agreement
of
idea
with
existence
beyond
idea
is
it
an
absolute
which
transcends
and
absorbs
the
difference
then
once
more
what
is
the
test
of
any
specific
judgment
what
has
become
of
the
correspondence
of
fact
and
thought
or
more
urgently
since
the
pressing
problem
of
life
of
practice
and
of
science
is
the
discrimination
of
the
or
validity
of
this
or
that
theory
plan
or
interpretation
what
is
the
criterion
of
truth
within
present
experience
where
the
distinction
between
factual
conditions
and
thoughts
and
the
necessity
of
some
working
adjustment
persist
putting
the
problem
in
yet
another
way
either
both
fact
and
idea
are
present
all
the
time
or
else
only
one
of
them
is
present
but
if
the
former
why
should
there
be
an
idea
at
all
and
why
should
it
have
to
be
tested
by
the
fact
when
we
already
have
what
we
want
namely
existence
reality
why
should
we
take
up
the
wholly
supernumerary
task
of
forming
more
or
less
imperfect
ideas
of
those
facts
and
then
engage
in
the
idle
performance
of
testing
them
by
what
we
already
know
to
be
but
if
only
ideas
are
present
it
is
idle
to
speak
of
comparing
an
idea
with
facts
and
testing
its
validity
by
its
agreement
the
elaboration
and
refinement
of
ideas
to
the
uttermost
still
leaves
us
with
an
idea
and
while
a
idea
stands
a
show
of
being
true
in
a
way
in
which
an
incoherent
one
does
not
a
idea
is
still
but
a
hypothesis
a
candidate
for
truth
ideas
are
not
made
true
by
getting
bigger
but
if
only
are
present
the
whole
conception
of
agreement
is
once
more
given
up
not
to
mention
that
such
a
situation
is
one
in
which
there
is
by
definition
no
thinking
or
reflective
factor
at
all
this
suggests
that
a
strictly
monistic
epistemology
whether
idealistic
or
realistic
does
not
get
rid
of
the
problem
suppose
for
example
we
take
a
sensationalistic
idealism
it
does
away
with
the
ontological
gulf
between
ideas
and
facts
and
by
reducing
both
terms
to
a
common
denominator
seems
to
facilitate
fruitful
discussion
of
the
problem
but
the
problem
of
the
distinction
and
reference
agreement
correspondence
of
two
types
or
sorts
of
sensations
still
persists
if
i
say
the
box
there
is
square
and
call
box
one
of
a
group
of
ideas
or
sensations
and
square
another
sensation
or
idea
the
old
question
comes
up
is
square
already
a
part
of
the
facts
of
the
box
or
is
it
not
if
it
is
it
is
a
supernumerary
an
idle
thing
both
as
an
idea
and
as
an
assertion
of
fact
if
it
is
not
how
can
we
compare
the
two
ideas
and
what
on
earth
or
in
heaven
does
their
agreement
or
correspondence
mean
if
it
means
simply
that
we
experience
the
two
sensations
in
juxtaposition
then
the
same
is
true
of
course
of
any
casual
association
or
hallucination
on
the
sensational
basis
accordingly
there
is
still
a
distinction
of
something
given
there
brutally
factual
the
box
and
something
else
which
stands
on
a
different
level
ideal
absent
intended
demanded
the
square
which
is
asserted
to
hold
good
or
be
true
of
the
thing
box
the
fact
that
both
are
sensations
throws
no
light
on
the
logical
validity
of
any
proposition
or
belief
because
by
theory
a
like
statement
holds
of
every
possible
proposition
the
same
problem
recurs
on
a
realistic
basis
for
example
there
has
recently
been
propounded
the
doctrine
of
the
distinction
between
relations
of
space
and
time
and
relations
of
meaning
or
significance
as
a
key
to
the
problem
of
knowledge
things
exist
in
their
own
characters
in
their
temporal
and
spatial
relations
when
knowledge
intervenes
there
is
nothing
new
of
a
subjective
or
psychical
sort
but
simply
a
new
relation
of
the
things
the
suggesting
or
signifying
of
one
thing
by
another
now
this
seems
to
be
an
excellent
way
of
stating
the
logical
problem
but
i
take
it
it
states
and
does
not
solve
for
the
characteristic
of
such
situations
claiming
to
terminate
in
knowledge
is
precisely
that
the
is
predicated
the
other
relations
it
is
referred
to
them
it
is
not
simply
a
supervention
existing
side
by
side
with
them
like
casual
suggestions
or
the
play
of
phantasy
it
is
something
which
the
facts
the
qualitative
space
and
time
things
must
bear
the
burden
of
must
accept
and
take
unto
themselves
as
part
of
themselves
until
this
happens
we
have
only
thinking
not
accomplished
knowledge
hence
logically
the
existential
relations
play
the
r√¥le
of
fact
and
the
relation
of
signification
that
of
idea
distinguished
from
fact
and
yet
if
valid
to
hold
fact
this
appears
quite
clearly
in
the
following
quotation
it
is
the
ice
which
means
that
it
will
cool
the
water
just
as
much
as
it
is
the
ice
which
does
cool
the
water
when
put
into
it
there
is
however
a
possible
ambiguity
in
the
statement
to
which
we
shall
return
later
that
the
ice
the
thing
regarded
as
ice
cooling
is
as
real
as
is
a
case
of
actual
cooling
but
of
course
not
every
suggestion
is
valid
the
ice
may
be
a
crystal
and
it
will
not
cool
water
at
all
so
far
as
it
is
already
certain
that
this
ice
and
also
certain
that
ice
under
all
circumstances
cools
water
the
stands
on
the
same
level
as
the
physical
being
not
merely
suggested
but
part
of
the
facts
ascertained
it
is
not
a
as
such
at
all
we
already
have
truth
the
entire
work
of
knowing
as
logical
is
done
we
have
no
longer
the
relation
characteristic
of
reflective
situations
here
again
the
implication
of
the
thinking
situation
is
of
some
correspondence
or
agreement
between
two
sets
of
distinguished
relations
the
problem
of
valid
determination
remains
the
central
question
of
any
theory
of
knowing
in
its
relation
to
facts
and
truth
ii
i
hope
this
statement
of
the
difficulty
however
inadequate
will
serve
at
least
to
indicate
that
a
functional
logic
inherits
the
problem
in
question
and
does
not
create
it
that
it
has
never
for
a
moment
denied
the
prima
facie
working
distinction
between
ideas
thoughts
meanings
and
facts
existences
the
environment
nor
the
necessity
of
a
control
of
meaning
by
facts
it
is
concerned
not
with
denying
but
with
understanding
what
is
denied
is
not
the
genuineness
of
the
problem
of
the
terms
in
which
it
is
stated
but
the
reality
and
value
of
the
orthodox
interpretation
what
is
insisted
upon
is
the
relative
instrumental
or
working
character
of
the
distinction
that
it
a
distinction
instituted
and
maintained
in
the
interests
of
intelligence
with
all
that
intelligence
imports
in
the
exercise
of
the
life
functions
to
this
positive
side
i
now
turn
in
the
analysis
it
may
prove
convenient
to
take
an
illustration
of
a
man
lost
in
the
woods
taking
this
case
as
typical
of
any
reflective
situation
in
so
far
as
it
involves
perplexity
a
problem
to
be
solved
the
problem
is
to
find
a
correct
idea
of
the
way
home
a
practical
idea
or
plan
of
action
which
will
lead
to
success
or
the
realization
of
the
purpose
to
get
home
now
the
critics
of
the
experimental
theory
of
logic
make
the
point
that
this
practical
idea
the
truth
of
which
is
evidenced
in
the
successful
meeting
of
a
need
is
dependent
for
its
success
upon
a
purely
presentative
idea
that
of
the
existent
environment
whose
validity
has
nothing
to
do
with
success
but
depends
on
agreement
with
the
given
state
of
affairs
it
is
said
that
what
makes
a
man
idea
of
his
environment
true
is
its
agreement
with
the
actual
environment
and
generally
a
true
idea
in
any
situation
consists
in
its
agreement
with
reality
i
have
already
indicated
my
acceptance
of
this
formula
but
it
was
long
my
misfortune
not
to
be
possessed
offhand
of
those
perfectly
clear
notions
of
just
what
is
meant
in
this
formula
by
the
terms
idea
existence
and
agreement
which
are
possessed
by
other
writers
on
epistemology
and
when
i
analyzed
these
notions
i
found
the
distinction
between
the
practical
idea
and
the
theoretical
not
fixed
nor
final
and
i
found
a
somewhat
startling
similarity
between
the
notions
of
success
and
agreement
just
what
is
the
environment
of
which
an
idea
is
to
be
formed
what
is
the
intellectual
content
or
objective
detail
to
be
assigned
to
the
term
environment
it
can
hardly
mean
the
actual
visible
environment
the
trees
rocks
which
a
man
is
actually
looking
at
these
things
are
there
and
it
seems
superfluous
to
form
an
idea
of
them
moreover
the
wayfaring
man
though
lost
would
have
to
be
an
unusually
perverse
fool
if
under
such
circumstances
he
were
unable
to
form
an
idea
supposing
he
chose
to
engage
in
this
luxury
in
agreement
with
these
facts
the
environment
must
be
a
larger
environment
than
the
visible
facts
it
must
include
things
not
within
the
direct
ken
of
the
lost
man
it
must
for
instance
extend
from
where
he
is
now
to
his
home
or
to
the
point
from
which
he
started
it
must
include
unperceived
elements
in
their
contrast
with
the
perceived
otherwise
the
man
would
not
be
lost
now
we
are
at
once
struck
with
the
facts
that
the
lost
man
has
no
alternative
except
either
to
wander
aimlessly
or
else
to
this
inclusive
environment
and
that
this
conception
is
just
what
is
meant
by
idea
it
is
not
some
little
psychical
entity
or
piece
of
but
is
interpretation
of
the
locally
present
environment
in
reference
to
its
absent
that
part
to
which
it
is
referred
as
another
part
so
as
to
give
a
view
of
a
whole
just
how
such
an
idea
would
differ
from
one
plan
of
action
in
finding
one
way
i
do
not
know
for
plan
if
it
be
really
a
plan
a
method
is
a
conception
of
what
is
given
in
its
hypothetical
relations
to
what
is
not
given
employed
as
a
guide
to
that
act
which
results
in
the
absent
being
also
given
it
is
a
map
constructed
with
one
self
lost
and
one
self
found
whether
at
starting
or
at
home
again
as
its
two
limits
if
this
map
in
its
specific
character
is
not
also
the
only
guide
to
the
way
home
only
plan
of
action
then
i
hope
i
may
never
be
lost
it
is
the
facts
of
being
lost
and
desiring
to
be
found
which
constitute
the
limits
and
the
content
of
the
environment
then
comes
the
test
of
of
the
idea
and
the
environment
supposing
the
individual
stands
still
and
attempts
to
compare
his
idea
with
the
reality
with
what
reality
is
he
to
compare
it
not
with
the
presented
reality
for
reality
is
the
reality
of
himself
lost
not
with
the
complete
reality
for
at
this
stage
of
proceedings
he
has
only
the
idea
to
stand
for
the
complete
theory
what
kind
of
comparison
is
possible
or
desirable
then
save
to
treat
the
mental
layout
of
the
whole
situation
as
a
working
hypothesis
as
a
plan
of
action
and
proceed
to
upon
it
to
use
it
as
a
director
and
controller
of
one
divagations
instead
of
stumbling
blindly
around
until
one
is
either
exhausted
or
accidentally
gets
out
now
suppose
one
uses
the
idea
that
is
to
say
the
present
facts
projected
into
a
whole
in
the
light
of
absent
facts
as
a
guide
of
action
suppose
by
means
of
its
specifications
one
works
one
way
along
until
one
comes
upon
familiar
ground
finds
one
self
one
may
say
my
idea
was
right
it
was
in
accord
with
facts
it
agrees
with
reality
that
is
acted
upon
sincerely
it
has
led
to
the
desired
conclusion
it
has
worked
out
the
state
of
things
which
it
contemplated
or
intended
the
agreement
correspondence
is
between
purpose
plan
and
its
own
execution
fulfillment
between
a
map
of
a
course
constructed
for
the
sake
of
guiding
behavior
and
the
result
attained
in
acting
upon
the
indications
of
the
map
just
how
does
such
agreement
differ
from
success
iii
if
we
exclude
acting
upon
the
idea
no
conceivable
amount
or
kind
of
intellectualistic
procedure
can
confirm
or
refute
an
idea
or
throw
any
light
upon
its
validity
how
does
the
view
consider
that
verification
takes
place
does
it
suppose
that
we
first
look
a
long
while
at
the
facts
and
then
a
long
time
at
the
idea
until
by
some
magical
process
the
degree
and
kind
of
their
agreement
become
visible
unless
there
is
some
such
conception
as
this
what
conception
of
agreement
is
possible
except
the
experimental
or
practical
one
and
if
it
be
admitted
that
verification
involves
action
how
can
that
action
be
relevant
to
the
truth
of
an
idea
unless
the
idea
is
itself
already
relevant
to
action
if
by
acting
in
accordance
with
the
experimental
definition
of
facts
as
obstacles
and
conditions
and
the
experimental
definition
of
the
end
or
intent
as
plan
and
method
of
action
a
harmonized
situation
effectually
presents
itself
we
have
the
adequate
and
the
only
conceivable
verification
of
the
intellectual
factors
if
the
action
indicated
be
carried
out
and
the
disordered
or
disturbed
situation
persists
then
we
have
not
merely
confuted
the
tentative
positions
of
intelligence
but
we
have
in
the
very
process
of
acting
introduced
new
data
and
eliminated
some
of
the
old
ones
and
thus
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
resurvey
of
the
facts
and
the
revision
of
the
plan
of
action
by
acting
faithfully
upon
an
inadequate
reflective
presentation
we
have
at
least
secured
the
elements
for
its
improvement
this
of
course
gives
no
absolute
guaranty
that
the
reflection
will
at
any
time
be
so
performed
as
to
prove
its
validity
in
fact
but
the
of
intellectual
content
through
acting
upon
it
in
good
faith
is
the
absolute
of
knowledge
loyalty
to
which
is
the
religion
of
intellect
the
intellectual
definition
or
delimitation
assigned
to
the
given
is
thus
as
tentative
and
experimental
as
that
ascribed
to
the
idea
in
form
both
are
categorical
and
in
content
both
are
hypothetical
facts
really
exist
just
as
facts
and
meanings
exist
as
meanings
one
is
no
more
superfluous
more
subjective
or
less
necessitated
than
the
other
in
and
of
themselves
as
existences
both
are
equally
realistic
and
compulsive
but
on
the
basis
of
existence
there
is
no
element
in
either
which
may
be
strictly
described
as
intellectual
or
cognitional
there
is
only
a
practical
situation
in
its
brute
and
unrationalized
form
what
is
uncertain
about
the
facts
as
given
at
any
moment
is
whether
the
right
exclusions
and
selections
have
been
made
since
that
is
a
question
which
can
be
decided
finally
only
by
the
experimental
issue
this
ascription
of
character
is
itself
tentative
and
experimental
if
it
works
the
characterization
and
delineation
are
found
to
be
proper
ones
but
every
admission
prior
to
inquiry
of
unquestioned
categorical
rigid
objectivity
compromises
the
probability
that
it
will
work
the
character
assigned
to
the
datum
must
be
taken
as
hypothetically
as
possible
in
order
to
preserve
the
elasticity
needed
for
easy
and
prompt
reconsideration
any
other
procedure
virtually
insists
that
all
facts
and
details
anywhere
happening
to
exist
and
happening
to
present
themselves
all
being
equally
real
must
all
be
given
equal
status
and
equal
weight
and
that
their
outer
ramifications
and
internal
complexities
must
be
indefinitely
followed
up
the
worthlessness
of
this
sheer
accumulation
of
realities
its
total
irrelevancy
the
lack
of
any
way
of
judging
the
significance
of
the
accumulations
are
good
proofs
of
the
fallacy
of
any
theory
which
ascribes
objective
logical
content
to
facts
wholly
apart
from
the
needs
and
possibilities
of
a
situation
the
more
stubbornly
one
maintains
the
reality
of
either
his
facts
or
his
ideas
just
as
they
stand
the
more
accidental
is
the
discovery
of
relevantly
significant
facts
and
of
valid
ideas
the
more
accidental
the
less
rational
is
the
issue
of
the
knowledge
situation
due
progress
is
reasonably
probable
in
just
the
degree
in
which
the
meaning
categorical
in
its
existing
imperativeness
and
the
fact
equally
categorical
in
its
brute
coerciveness
are
assigned
only
a
provisional
and
tentative
nature
with
reference
to
control
of
the
situation
that
this
surrender
of
a
rigid
and
final
character
for
the
content
of
knowledge
on
the
sides
both
of
fact
and
of
meaning
in
favor
of
experimental
and
functioning
estimations
is
precisely
the
change
which
has
marked
the
development
of
modern
from
mediaeval
and
greek
science
seems
undoubted
to
learn
the
lesson
one
has
only
to
contrast
the
rigidity
of
phenomena
and
conceptions
in
greek
thought
platonic
ideas
aristotelian
forms
with
the
modern
experimental
selection
and
determining
of
facts
and
experimental
employment
of
hypotheses
the
former
have
ceased
to
be
ultimate
realities
of
a
nondescript
sort
and
have
become
provisional
data
the
latter
have
ceased
to
be
eternal
meanings
and
have
become
working
theories
the
fruitful
application
of
mathematics
and
the
evolution
of
a
technique
of
experimental
inquiry
have
coincided
with
this
change
that
realities
exist
independently
of
their
use
as
intellectual
data
and
that
meanings
exist
apart
from
their
utilization
as
hypotheses
are
the
permanent
truths
of
greek
realism
as
against
the
exaggerated
subjectivism
of
modern
philosophy
but
the
conception
that
this
existence
is
to
be
defined
in
the
same
way
as
are
contents
of
knowledge
so
that
perfect
being
is
object
of
perfect
knowledge
and
imperfect
being
object
of
imperfect
knowledge
is
the
fallacy
which
greek
thought
projected
into
modern
science
has
advanced
in
its
methods
in
just
the
degree
in
which
it
has
ceased
to
assume
that
prior
realities
and
prior
meanings
retain
fixedly
and
finally
when
entering
into
reflective
situations
the
characters
they
had
prior
to
this
entrance
and
in
which
it
has
realized
that
their
very
presence
within
the
knowledge
situation
signifies
that
they
have
to
be
redefined
and
revalued
from
the
standpoint
of
the
new
situation
iv
this
conception
does
not
however
commit
us
to
the
view
that
there
is
any
conscious
situation
which
is
totally
it
may
be
true
that
any
experience
which
can
properly
be
termed
such
comprises
something
which
is
over
and
against
what
is
given
or
there
but
there
are
many
situations
into
which
the
rational
factor
the
mutual
distinction
and
mutual
reference
of
fact
and
meaning
enters
only
incidentally
and
is
slurred
not
accentuated
many
disturbances
are
relatively
trivial
and
induce
only
a
slight
and
superficial
redefinition
of
contents
this
passing
tension
of
facts
against
meaning
may
suffice
to
call
up
and
carry
a
wide
range
of
meaningful
facts
which
are
quite
irrelevant
to
the
intellectual
problem
such
is
the
case
where
the
individual
is
finding
his
way
through
any
field
which
is
upon
the
whole
familiar
and
which
accordingly
requires
only
an
occasional
resurvey
and
revaluation
at
moments
of
slight
perplexity
we
may
call
these
situations
if
we
will
knowledge
situations
for
the
reflective
function
characteristic
of
knowledge
is
present
but
so
denominating
them
does
not
do
away
with
their
sharp
difference
from
those
situations
in
which
the
critical
qualification
of
facts
and
definition
of
meanings
constitute
the
main
business
to
speak
of
the
passing
attention
which
a
traveler
has
occasionally
to
give
to
the
indications
of
his
proper
path
in
a
fairly
familiar
and
beaten
highway
as
knowledge
in
just
the
same
sense
in
which
the
deliberate
inquiry
of
a
mathematician
or
a
chemist
or
a
logician
is
knowledge
is
as
confusing
to
the
real
issue
involved
as
would
be
the
denial
to
it
of
reflective
factor
if
then
one
bears
in
mind
these
two
considerations
the
unique
problem
and
purpose
of
every
reflective
situation
and
the
difference
as
to
range
and
thoroughness
of
logical
function
in
different
types
of
reflective
situations
one
need
have
no
difficulty
with
the
doctrine
that
the
great
obstacle
in
the
development
of
scientific
knowing
is
that
facts
and
meanings
enter
such
situations
with
stubborn
and
alien
characteristics
imported
from
other
situations
this
affords
an
opportunity
to
speak
again
of
the
logical
problem
to
which
reference
and
promise
of
return
were
made
earlier
in
this
paper
facts
may
be
regarded
as
existing
qualitatively
and
in
certain
spatial
and
temporal
relations
when
there
is
knowledge
another
relation
is
added
that
of
one
thing
meaning
or
signifying
another
water
exists
for
example
as
water
in
a
certain
place
in
a
certain
temporal
sequence
but
it
may
signify
the
quenching
of
thirst
and
this
constitutes
knowledge
this
statement
may
be
taken
in
a
way
congruous
with
the
account
developed
in
this
paper
but
it
may
also
be
taken
in
another
sense
consideration
of
which
will
serve
to
enforce
the
point
regarding
the
tentative
nature
of
the
characterization
of
the
given
as
distinct
from
the
intended
and
absent
water
means
quenching
thirst
it
is
drunk
and
death
follows
it
was
not
water
but
a
poison
which
looked
like
water
or
it
is
drunk
and
is
water
but
does
not
quench
thirst
for
the
drinker
is
in
an
abnormal
condition
and
drinking
water
only
intensifies
the
thirst
or
it
is
drunk
and
quenches
thirst
but
it
also
brings
on
typhoid
fever
being
not
merely
water
but
water
plus
germs
now
all
these
events
demonstrate
that
error
may
appertain
quite
as
much
to
the
characterization
of
existing
things
suggesting
or
suggested
as
to
the
suggestion
suggestion
there
is
no
ground
for
giving
the
things
any
superior
reality
in
these
cases
indeed
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
the
mistake
is
made
because
qualitative
thing
and
suggested
or
were
discriminated
the
signifying
force
was
regarded
as
a
part
of
the
direct
quality
of
the
given
fact
quite
as
much
as
its
color
liquidity
etc
it
is
only
in
another
situation
that
it
is
discriminated
as
a
relation
instead
of
being
regarded
as
an
element
it
is
quite
as
true
to
say
that
a
thing
is
called
water
because
it
suggests
as
to
say
that
it
suggests
because
it
is
characterized
as
water
knowledge
function
becomes
prominent
or
dominant
in
the
degree
in
which
there
is
a
conscious
discrimination
between
the
and
the
and
this
inevitably
means
that
the
water
ceases
to
be
water
just
as
it
becomes
doubtful
or
hypothetical
whether
this
thing
whatever
it
is
really
means
if
it
really
means
it
is
water
so
far
as
it
may
not
mean
it
it
perhaps
is
not
water
it
is
now
just
as
much
a
question
this
as
what
it
means
whatever
will
resolve
one
question
will
resolve
the
other
in
just
the
degree
then
in
which
an
existence
or
thing
gets
intellectualized
force
or
function
it
becomes
a
fragmentary
and
dubious
thing
to
be
circumscribed
and
described
for
the
sake
of
operating
as
or
clue
of
a
reality
to
be
realized
through
action
only
as
reality
is
reduced
to
a
sign
and
questions
of
its
nature
as
sign
are
considered
does
it
get
intellectual
or
cognitional
status
the
bearing
of
this
upon
the
question
of
practical
character
of
the
distinctions
of
fact
and
idea
is
obvious
no
one
i
take
it
would
deny
that
action
of
some
sort
follow
upon
judgment
no
one
would
deny
that
this
action
somehow
serve
to
test
the
value
of
the
intellectual
operations
upon
which
it
follows
but
if
this
subsequent
action
is
subsequent
if
the
intellectual
categories
operations
and
distinctions
are
complete
in
themselves
without
inherent
reference
to
it
what
guaranty
is
there
that
they
pass
into
relevant
action
and
by
what
miracle
does
the
action
manage
to
test
the
worth
of
the
idea
but
if
the
intellectual
identification
and
description
of
the
thing
are
as
tentative
and
instrumental
as
is
the
ascription
of
significance
then
the
exigencies
of
the
active
situation
are
operative
in
all
the
categories
of
the
knowledge
situation
action
is
not
a
more
or
less
accidental
appendage
or
afterthought
but
is
undergoing
development
and
giving
direction
in
the
entire
knowledge
function
in
conclusion
i
remark
that
the
ease
with
which
the
practical
character
of
these
fundamental
logical
categories
fact
meaning
and
agreement
may
be
overlooked
or
denied
is
due
to
the
organic
way
in
which
practical
import
is
incarnate
in
them
it
can
be
overlooked
because
it
is
so
involved
in
the
terms
themselves
that
it
is
assumed
at
every
turn
the
pragmatist
is
in
the
position
of
one
who
is
charged
with
denying
the
existence
of
something
because
in
pointing
out
a
certain
fundamental
feature
of
it
he
puts
it
in
a
strange
light
such
confusion
always
occurs
when
the
familiar
is
brought
to
definition
the
difficulties
are
more
psychological
difficulties
of
orientation
and
mental
adjustment
than
logical
and
in
the
long
run
will
be
done
away
with
by
our
getting
used
to
the
different
viewpoint
rather
than
by
argument

asserting

in

in

and
article
by
woodbridge
on
the
problem
of
consciousness
especially
pp
in
other
words
ideas
is
a
term
capable
of
assuming
any
definition
which
is
logically
appropriate
say
meaning
it
need
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
conception
of
little
subjective
entities
or
psychical
stuffs
of
course
the
monistic
epistemologies
have
an
advantage
in
the
statement
of
the
problem
over
the
dualistic
they
do
not
state
it
in
terms
which
presuppose
the
impossibility
of
the
solution
this
view
was
originally
advanced
in
the
discussion
of
quite
another
problem
than
the
one
here
discussed
the
problem
of
consciousness
and
it
may
not
be
quite
just
to
dissever
it
from
that
context
but
as
a
formula
for
knowledge
it
has
enough
similarity
with
the
one
brought
out
in
this
paper
to
suggest
further
treatment
it
is
not
intended
that
the
results
reached
here
shall
apply
to
the
problem
of
consciousness
as
such

na√Øve

presentative
realism
i
in
spite
of
the
elucidations
of
contemporary
realists
a
number
of
idealists
continue
to
adduce
in
behalf
of
idealism
certain
facts
having
an
obvious
physical
nature
and
explanation
the
visible
convergence
of
the
railway
tracks
for
example
is
cited
as
evidence
that
what
is
seen
is
a
mental
content
yet
this
convergence
follows
from
the
physical
properties
of
light
and
a
lens
and
is
physically
demonstrated
in
a
camera
is
the
photograph
then
to
be
conceived
as
a
psychical
somewhat
that
the
time
of
the
visibility
of
a
light
does
not
coincide
with
the
time
at
which
a
distant
body
emitted
the
light
is
employed
to
support
a
similar
idealistic
conclusion
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
exact
difference
in
time
may
be
deduced
from
a
physical
property
of
light
its
rate
the
dislocation
in
space
of
the
light
seen
and
the
astronomical
star
is
used
as
evidence
of
the
mental
nature
of
the
former
though
the
exact
angular
difference
is
a
matter
of
simple
computation
from
purely
physical
data
the
doubling
of
images
of
say
the
finger
when
the
eyeball
is
pressed
is
frequently
proffered
as
a
clincher
yet
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
take
any
body
that
reflects
light
and
by
a
suitable
arrangement
of
lenses
to
produce
not
only
two
but
many
images
projected
into
space
if
the
fact
that
under
definite
conditions
misplacement
of
lenses
a
finger
yields
two
images
proves
the
psychical
character
of
the
latter
then
the
fact
that
under
certain
conditions
a
sounding
body
yields
one
or
more
echoes
is
by
parity
of
reasoning
proof
that
the
echo
is
made
of
mental
stuff
if
once
more
the
differences
in
form
and
color
of
a
table
to
different
observers
occupying
different
physical
positions
is
proof
that
what
each
sees
is
a
psychical
private
isolated
somewhat
then
the
fact
that
one
and
the
same
physical
body
has
different
effects
upon
or
relations
with
different
physical
media
is
proof
of
the
mental
nature
of
these
effects
take
a
lump
of
wax
and
subject
it
to
the
same
heat
located
at
different
positions
now
the
wax
is
solid
now
liquid
it
might
even
be
gaseous
how
psychical
these
phenomena
it
almost
seems
as
if
the
transformation
of
the
physical
into
the
mental
in
the
cases
cited
exemplifies
an
interesting
psychological
phenomenon
in
each
case
the
beginning
is
with
a
real
and
physical
existence
taking
the
real
object
the
astronomical
star
on
the
basis
of
its
physical
reality
the
idealist
concludes
to
a
psychical
object
radically
different
taking
the
object
the
finger
from
the
premise
of
its
real
singleness
he
concludes
to
a
double
mental
content
which
then
takes
the
place
of
the
original
single
thing
taking
the
table
presenting
different
surfaces
and
reflections
of
light
to
different
real
organisms
he
eliminates
the
in
behalf
of
a
multiplicity
of
totally
separate
psychical
tables
the
logic
reminds
us
of
the
story
of
the
countryman
who
after
gazing
at
the
giraffe
remarked
there
ai
no
such
animal
it
almost
seems
i
repeat
as
if
this
in
the
argument
creates
in
some
minds
the
impression
that
the
object
not
the
argument
is
undergoing
the
extraordinary
reversal
of
form
however
this
may
be
the
problem
indicated
in
the
foregoing
cases
is
simply
the
good
old
problem
of
the
many
in
one
or
less
cryptically
the
problem
of
the
maintenance
of
a
continuity
of
process
throughout
differences
i
do
not
pretend
that
this
situation
though
the
most
familiar
thing
in
life
is
wholly
without
difficulties
but
its
difficulty
is
not
one
of
epistemology
that
is
of
the
relation
of
known
to
a
knower
to
take
it
as
such
and
then
to
use
it
as
proof
of
the
psychical
nature
of
a
final
term
is
also
to
prove
that
the
trail
the
rocket
stick
leaves
behind
is
psychical
or
that
the
flower
which
comes
in
a
continuity
of
process
from
a
seed
is
mental
ii
contemporary
realists
have
so
frequently
and
clearly
expounded
the
physical
explanation
of
such
cases
as
have
been
cited
that
one
is
at
a
loss
as
to
why
idealists
go
on
repeating
the
cases
without
even
alluding
to
the
realistic
explanation
one
is
moved
to
wonder
whether
this
neglect
is
just
one
of
those
circumstances
which
persistently
dog
philosophical
discussions
or
whether
something
in
the
realistic
position
gives
ground
from
at
least
an
point
of
view
for
the
neglect
there
is
a
reason
for
adopting
the
latter
alternative
many
realists
in
offering
the
type
of
explanation
adduced
above
have
treated
the
cases
of
seen
light
doubled
imagery
as
perception
in
a
way
that
ascribes
to
perception
an
inherent
cognitive
status
they
have
treated
the
perceptions
as
of
instead
of
as
simply
natural
events
having
in
themselves
apart
from
a
that
may
be
made
of
them
no
more
knowledge
status
or
worth
than
say
a
shower
or
a
fever
what
i
intend
to
show
is
that
if
perceptions
are
regarded
as
cases
of
knowledge
the
gate
is
opened
to
the
idealistic
interpretation
the
physical
explanation
holds
of
them
as
long
as
they
are
regarded
simply
as
natural
events
a
doctrine
i
shall
call
na√Øve
realism
it
does
not
hold
of
them
considered
as
cases
of
knowledge
the
view
i
call
presentative
realism
the
idealists
attribute
to
the
realists
the
doctrine
that
the
perceived
object
is
the
real
object
please
note
the
wording
it
assumes
that
there
is
real
object
something
which
stands
in
a
contrasting
relation
with
objects
not
real
or
else
less
real
since
it
is
easily
demonstrable
that
there
is
a
numerical
duplicity
between
the
astronomical
star
and
its
effect
of
visible
light
between
the
single
finger
and
the
doubled
images
the
latter
evidently
when
the
former
is
dubbed
real
object
stands
in
disparaging
contrast
to
its
reality
it
is
a
case
of
knowledge
the
knowledge
refers
to
the
star
and
yet
not
the
star
but
something
more
or
less
unreal
that
is
if
the
star
be
the
real
object
is
known
consider
how
simply
the
matter
stands
in
what
i
have
called
na√Øve
realism
the
astronomical
star
is
real
object
but
not
the
real
object
the
visible
light
is
another
real
object
found
when
knowledge
supervenes
to
be
an
occurrence
standing
in
a
process
continuous
with
the
star
since
the
seen
light
is
an
event
within
a
continuous
process
there
is
no
point
of
view
from
which
its
reality
contrasts
with
that
of
the
star
but
suppose
that
the
realist
accepts
the
traditionary
psychology
according
to
which
every
event
in
the
way
of
a
perception
is
also
a
case
of
knowing
something
is
the
way
out
now
so
simple
in
the
case
of
the
doubled
fingers
or
the
seen
light
the
thing
known
in
perception
contrasts
with
the
physical
source
and
cause
of
the
knowledge
there
a
numerical
duplicity
moreover
the
thing
known
by
perception
is
by
this
hypothesis
in
relation
to
a
knower
while
the
physical
cause
is
not
is
not
the
most
plausible
account
of
the
difference
between
the
physical
cause
of
the
perceptive
knowledge
and
what
the
latter
presents
precisely
this
latter
difference
namely
presentation
to
a
knower
if
perception
is
a
case
of
knowing
it
must
be
a
case
of
knowing
the
star
but
since
the
real
star
is
not
known
in
the
perception
the
knowledge
relation
must
somehow
have
changed
the
object
into
a
content
thus
when
the
realist
conceives
the
perceptual
occurrence
as
an
intrinsic
case
of
knowledge
or
of
presentation
to
a
mind
or
knower
he
lets
the
nose
of
the
idealist
camel
into
the
tent
he
has
then
no
great
cause
for
surprise
when
the
camel
comes
in
and
devours
the
tent
perhaps
it
will
seem
as
if
in
this
last
paragraph
i
had
gone
back
on
what
i
said
earlier
regarding
the
physical
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
visible
light
and
the
astronomical
star
on
the
contrary
my
point
is
that
this
explanation
though
wholly
adequate
as
long
as
we
conceive
the
perception
to
be
itself
simply
a
natural
event
is
not
at
all
available
when
we
conceive
it
to
be
an
attempt
at
knowing
its
cause
in
the
former
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
relation
between
natural
events
in
the
latter
case
we
are
dealing
with
the
difference
between
an
object
as
a
cause
of
knowledge
and
an
object
as
known
and
hence
in
relation
to
mind
by
the
method
of
difference
the
sole
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
two
objects
is
then
the
absence
or
presence
of
relation
to
a
knower
in
the
case
of
the
seen
light
reference
to
the
velocity
of
light
is
quite
adequate
to
account
for
its
time
and
space
differences
from
the
star
but
viewed
as
a
case
of
what
is
known
on
the
supposition
that
perception
is
knowing
reference
to
it
only
increases
the
contrast
between
the
real
object
and
the
object
known
in
perception
for
being
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
object
that
causes
the
perception
as
is
the
star
itself
it
the
velocity
of
light
logically
to
be
part
of
what
is
known
in
the
perception
while
it
is
not
since
the
velocity
of
light
is
a
constituent
element
in
the
star
it
should
be
known
in
the
perception
since
it
is
not
so
known
reference
to
it
only
increases
the
discrepancy
between
the
object
of
the
perception
the
seen
light
and
the
real
astronomical
star
the
same
is
true
of
any
physical
condition
that
might
be
referred
to
very
things
that
from
the
standpoint
of
perception
as
a
natural
event
are
conditions
that
account
for
its
happening
are
from
the
standpoint
of
perception
as
a
case
of
knowledge
part
of
the
object
which
if
knowledge
is
to
be
valid
ought
to
be
known
but
is
in
this
fact
we
have
perhaps
the
ground
of
the
idealist
disregard
of
the
physical
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
perceptual
event
and
real
object
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
some
realists
who
read
these
lines
will
feel
that
in
my
last
paragraphs
i
have
been
making
a
covert
argument
for
idealism
not
so
i
repeat
they
are
an
argument
for
a
truly
na√Øve
realism
the
presentative
realist
in
his
appeal
to
and
the
plain
man
first
sophisticates
the
umpire
and
then
appeals
he
stops
a
good
way
short
of
a
genuine
na√Øvet√©
the
plain
man
for
a
surety
does
not
regard
noises
heard
lights
seen
as
mental
existences
but
neither
does
he
regard
them
as
things
that
they
are
just
things
is
good
enough
for
him
that
they
are
in
relation
to
mind
or
in
relation
to
mind
as
their
knower
no
more
occurs
to
him
than
that
they
are
mental
by
this
i
mean
much
more
than
that
the
formulae
of
epistemology
are
foreign
to
him
i
mean
that
his
attitude
to
these
things
things
involves
their
being
in
relation
to
him
as
a
mind
or
a
knower
he
is
in
the
attitude
of
a
liker
or
hater
a
doer
or
an
appreciator
when
he
takes
the
attitude
of
a
knower
he
begins
to
inquire
once
depart
from
thorough
na√Øvet√©
and
substitute
for
it
the
psychological
theory
that
perception
is
a
cognitive
presentation
to
a
mind
of
a
causal
object
and
the
first
step
is
taken
on
the
road
which
ends
in
an
idealistic
system
iii
for
simplicity
sake
i
have
written
as
if
my
main
problem
were
to
show
how
in
the
face
of
a
supposed
difficulty
a
strictly
realistic
theory
of
the
perceptual
event
may
be
maintained
but
my
interest
is
primarily
in
the
facts
and
in
the
theory
only
because
of
the
facts
it
formulates
the
significance
of
the
facts
of
the
case
may
perhaps
be
indicated
by
a
consideration
which
has
thus
far
been
ignored
in
regarding
a
perception
as
a
case
of
knowledge
the
presentative
realist
does
more
than
shove
into
it
a
relation
to
mind
which
then
naturally
and
inevitably
becomes
the
explanation
of
any
differences
that
exist
between
its
and
some
causal
object
with
which
it
contrasts
in
many
cases
very
important
cases
too
in
the
physical
sciences
the
contrasting
real
object
becomes
known
by
a
logical
process
by
inference
as
the
contemporary
position
of
the
star
is
determined
by
calculations
from
data
not
by
perception
this
then
is
the
situation
of
the
presentative
realist
if
perception
is
knowledge
of
its
cause
it
stands
in
unfavorable
contrast
with
another
indirect
mode
of
knowledge
object
is
less
valid
than
the
object
of
inference
i
do
not
adduce
these
considerations
as
showing
that
the
case
is
hopeless
for
the
presentative
realist
i
am
willing
to
concede
he
can
find
a
satisfactory
way
out
but
the
difficulty
exists
and
in
existing
it
calls
emphatic
attention
to
a
case
which
is
certainly
and
indisputably
a
case
of
knowledge
namely
propositions
arrived
at
through
inference
judgments
as
logical
assertions
with
relation
to
the
unquestionable
case
of
knowledge
the
logical
or
inferential
case
perceptions
occupy
a
unique
status
one
which
readily
accounts
for
their
being
regarded
as
cases
of
knowledge
although
in
themselves
they
are
natural
events
they
are
the
sole
ultimate
data
the
sole
media
of
inference
to
all
natural
objects
and
processes
while
we
do
not
in
any
intelligible
or
verifiable
sense
know
we
know
all
things
that
we
do
know
or
them
they
furnish
the
only
ultimate
evidence
of
the
existence
and
nature
of
the
objects
which
we
infer
and
they
are
the
sole
ultimate
checks
and
tests
of
the
inferences
the
visible
light
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
we
infer
the
existence
place
and
structure
of
the
astronomical
star
and
some
other
perception
is
the
verifying
check
on
the
value
of
the
inference
because
of
this
characteristic
use
of
perceptions
the
perceptions
themselves
acquire
by
second
intention
a
knowledge
status
they
objects
of
minute
accurate
and
experimental
scrutiny
since
the
body
of
propositions
that
forms
natural
science
hangs
upon
them
scientific
their
nature
evidence
signs
entirely
overshadows
their
natural
status
that
of
being
simply
natural
events
the
scientific
man
as
scientific
cares
for
perceptions
not
in
themselves
but
as
they
throw
light
upon
the
nature
of
some
object
reached
by
evidence
and
since
every
such
inference
tries
to
terminate
in
a
further
perception
as
its
test
of
validity
the
value
of
inferential
knowing
depends
on
perception
independently
of
science
daily
life
uses
perceptions
as
signs
of
other
perceptions
when
a
perception
of
a
certain
kind
frequently
recurs
and
is
constantly
used
as
evidence
of
some
other
impending
perceptual
event
the
function
of
habit
a
natural
function
be
it
noted
not
a
psychical
or
epistemological
function
often
brings
it
about
that
the
perception
loses
its
original
quality
in
acquiring
a
language
is
of
course
the
typical
case
noises
in
themselves
mere
natural
events
through
habitual
use
as
signs
of
other
natural
events
become
integrated
with
what
they
mean
what
they
stand
for
is
telescoped
as
it
were
into
what
they
are
this
happens
also
with
other
natural
events
colors
tastes
etc
thus
practical
many
perceptual
events
are
cases
of
knowledge
that
is
they
have
been
as
such
so
often
that
the
habit
of
so
using
them
is
established
or
automatic
in
this
brief
reference
to
facts
that
are
perfectly
familiar
i
have
tried
to
suggest
three
points
of
crucial
importance
for
a
na√Øve
realism
first
that
inferential
or
evidential
knowledge
that
involving
logical
relation
is
in
the
field
as
an
obvious
and
undisputed
case
of
knowledge
second
that
this
function
although
embodying
the
logical
relation
is
itself
a
natural
and
specifically
detectable
process
among
natural
things
it
is
not
a
or
epistemological
relation
third
that
the
practical
and
scientific
of
perceptual
events
in
the
evidential
or
inferential
function
is
such
as
to
make
them
objects
of
inquiry
and
limits
of
knowledge
and
to
such
a
degree
that
this
acquired
characteristic
quite
overshadows
in
many
cases
their
primary
nature
if
we
add
to
what
has
been
said
the
fact
that
like
every
natural
function
the
inferential
function
turns
out
better
in
some
cases
and
worse
in
others
we
get
a
naturalistic
or
na√Øvely
realistic
conception
of
the
of
knowledge
control
of
the
conditions
of
inference
the
only
type
of
knowledge
detectable
in
direct
existence
so
as
to
guide
it
toward
better
conclusions
iv
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
i
will
receive
much
gratitude
from
realists
for
attempting
to
rescue
them
from
that
error
of
fact
which
exposes
their
doctrine
to
an
idealistic
interpretation
the
superstition
growing
up
in
a
false
physics
and
physiology
and
perpetuated
by
psychology
that
are
cases
of
knowledge
is
too
ingrained
but
let
them
try
the
experiment
of
conceiving
perceptions
as
pure
natural
events
not
as
cases
of
awareness
or
apprehension
and
they
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
little
they
miss
save
the
burden
of
carrying
traditionary
problems
meantime
while
philosophic
argument
such
as
this
will
do
little
to
change
the
state
of
belief
regarding
perceptions
the
development
of
biology
and
the
refinement
of
physiology
will
in
due
season
do
the
work
in
concluding
my
article
i
ought
to
refer
in
order
to
guard
against
misapprehension
to
a
reply
that
the
presentative
realist
might
make
to
my
objection
he
might
say
that
while
the
seen
light
is
a
case
of
knowledge
or
presentative
awareness
it
is
not
a
case
of
knowledge
of
the
star
but
simply
of
the
seen
light
just
as
it
is
in
this
case
the
appeal
to
the
physical
explanations
of
the
difference
of
the
seen
light
from
its
objective
source
is
quite
legitimate
at
first
sight
such
a
position
seems
innocent
and
tenable
even
if
innocent
it
would
however
be
ungrounded
since
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
knower
and
of
its
relation
to
the
seen
light
but
further
consideration
will
reveal
that
there
is
a
most
fundamental
objection
if
the
notion
of
perception
as
a
case
of
adequate
knowledge
of
its
own
be
accepted
the
knowledge
relation
is
absolutely
ubiquitous
it
is
an
net
the
predicament
is
inevitable
this
result
of
making
perception
a
case
of
knowing
will
now
occupy
us
footnotes
i
am
indebted
to
bush
article
on
knowledge
and
perception
of
philosophy
psychology
and
scientific
vol
vi
and
to
professor
woodbridge
article
on
perception
and
epistemology
in
the
memorial
as
well
as
to
his
paper
on
sensations
read
at
the
meeting
of
the
american
philosophical
association
since
my
point
of
departure
and
aim
are
somewhat
different
i
make
this
general
acknowledgment
in
lieu
of
more
specific
references
plato
use
of
shadows
of
reflections
in
the
water
and
other
images
or
imitations
to
prove
the
presence
in
nature
of
was
considering
the
state
of
physical
science
in
his
day
a
much
more
sensible
conclusion
than
the
modern
use
of
certain
images
as
proof
that
the
object
in
perception
is
a
psychical
content
hobbes
expressly
treats
all
images
as
physical
as
on
the
same
plane
as
reflections
in
the
water
and
echoes
the
comparison
is
his
it
is
impossible
in
this
brief
treatment
to
forestall
every
misapprehension
and
objection
yet
to
many
the
use
of
the
term
seen
will
appear
to
be
an
admission
that
a
case
of
knowledge
is
involved
but
is
smelling
a
case
of
knowledge
or
if
the
superstition
persists
as
to
smell
is
gnawing
or
poking
a
case
of
knowledge
my
point
of
course
is
that
seen
involves
a
relation
to
organic
activity
not
to
a
knower
or
mind
this
is
the
phase
of
the
matter
of
course
which
the
rationalistic
or
objective
realist
the
realist
of
the
type
of
green
emphasizes
put
in
terms
of
systems
the
difficulty
is
that
in
escaping
the
subjectivism
latent
in
treating
perception
as
a
case
of
knowledge
the
realist
runs
into
the
waiting
arms
of
the
objective
idealist
x
epistemological
realism
the
alleged
ubiquity
of
the
knowledge
relation
i
have
pointed
out
that
if
perception
be
treated
as
a
case
of
knowledge
knowledge
of
every
form
and
kind
must
be
treated
as
a
case
of
a
presentation
to
a
knower
the
alleged
discipline
of
epistemology
is
then
inevitable
in
common
usage
the
term
knowledge
tends
to
be
employed
eulogistically
its
meaning
approaches
the
connotation
of
the
term
science
more
loosely
it
is
used
of
course
to
designate
all
beliefs
and
propositions
that
are
held
with
assurance
especially
with
the
implication
that
the
assurance
is
reasonable
or
grounded
in
its
practical
sense
it
is
used
as
the
equivalent
of
knowing
of
skill
or
ability
involving
such
acquaintance
with
things
and
persons
as
enables
one
to
anticipate
how
they
behave
under
certain
conditions
and
to
take
steps
accordingly
such
usages
of
the
term
are
all
differential
they
all
involve
definite
contrasts
with
ungrounded
conviction
or
with
doubt
and
mere
guesswork
or
with
the
inexpertness
that
accompanies
lack
of
familiarity
in
its
epistemological
use
the
term
knowledge
has
a
blanket
value
which
is
absolutely
unknown
in
common
life
it
covers
any
and
every
presentation
of
any
and
every
thing
to
a
knower
to
an
awarer
if
i
may
coin
a
word
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
some
of
the
pitfalls
of
the
term
consciousness
and
i
repeat
this
indiscriminate
use
of
the
term
knowledge
so
foreign
to
science
and
daily
life
is
absolutely
unavoidable
if
perception
be
regarded
as
in
itself
a
mode
of
knowledge
and
then
and
only
then
the
problem
of
the
possibility
nature
and
extent
of
knowledge
is
also
inevitable
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
regarded
as
offensively
pragmatic
if
i
suggest
that
this
undesirable
consequence
is
a
good
reason
for
not
accepting
the
premise
from
which
it
follows
unless
that
premise
be
absolutely
forced
upon
us
at
all
events
upon
the
supposition
of
the
ubiquity
of
the
knowledge
relation
in
respect
to
a
self
presentative
realism
is
compelled
to
accept
the
genuineness
of
the
epistemological
problem
and
thus
to
convert
itself
into
an
epistemological
realism
getting
one
more
step
away
from
both
na√Øve
and
naturalistic
realism
the
problem
is
especially
acute
for
a
presentative
realism
because
idealism
has
made
precisely
this
ubiquity
of
relationship
its
axiom
its
one
sample
is
as
good
as
a
thousand
says
bain
there
is
no
possible
knowledge
of
a
world
except
in
relation
to
our
minds
knowledge
means
a
state
of
mind
the
notion
of
material
things
is
a
mental
fact
we
are
incapable
even
of
discussing
the
existence
of
an
independent
material
world
the
very
act
is
a
contradiction
we
can
speak
only
of
a
world
presented
to
our
own
minds
on
the
supposition
of
the
ubiquity
of
the
relation
realism
and
idealism
exhaust
the
alternatives
if
the
ubiquity
of
the
relation
is
a
myth
both
doctrines
are
unreal
because
there
is
no
problem
of
which
they
are
the
solution
my
first
step
in
indicating
the
unreality
of
both
solutions
is
formal
i
shall
try
to
show
that
the
knowledge
relation
of
things
to
a
self
is
the
exhaustive
and
inclusive
relation
there
is
no
intelligible
point
at
issue
between
idealism
and
realism
the
differences
between
them
are
either
verbal
or
else
due
to
a
failure
on
the
part
of
one
or
the
other
to
stick
to
their
premise
i
to
my
mind
professor
perry
rendered
philosophic
discussion
a
real
service
when
he
coined
the
phrase
predicament
the
phrase
designated
something
which
whether
or
no
it
be
real
in
itself
is
very
real
in
current
discussion
and
designating
it
rendered
it
more
accessible
to
examination
in
terming
the
alleged
uniform
complicity
of
a
knower
a
predicament
it
is
intended
i
take
it
to
suggest
among
other
things
that
we
have
here
a
difficulty
with
which
all
schools
of
thought
alike
must
reckon
so
that
it
is
a
difficulty
that
can
not
be
used
as
an
argument
in
behalf
of
one
school
and
against
another
if
the
relation
be
ubiquitous
it
affects
alike
every
view
every
theory
every
object
experienced
it
is
no
respecter
of
persons
no
respecter
of
doctrines
since
it
can
not
make
any
difference
to
any
particular
object
to
any
particular
logical
assertion
or
to
any
particular
theory
it
does
not
support
an
idealistic
as
against
a
realistic
theory
being
a
universal
common
denominator
of
all
theories
it
cancels
out
of
all
of
them
alike
it
leaves
the
issue
one
of
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
that
not
on
the
basis
of
an
unescapable
attendant
consideration
that
the
must
be
known
in
order
to
be
discussed
in
short
the
moral
is
quite
literally
forget
it
or
cut
it
out
but
the
idealist
may
be
imagined
to
reply
somewhat
as
follows
if
the
ubiquity
were
of
any
kind
other
than
precisely
the
kind
it
is
the
advice
to
disregard
it
as
a
mere
attendant
circumstance
of
discussion
would
be
relevant
thus
for
example
we
disregard
gravitation
when
we
are
considering
a
particular
chemical
reaction
there
is
no
ground
for
supposing
that
it
affects
a
reaction
in
any
way
that
modifies
it
as
a
chemical
reaction
and
if
the
relation
were
cited
when
the
point
at
issue
is
something
about
one
group
of
facts
in
distinction
from
another
group
it
ought
certainly
to
be
canceled
from
any
statement
about
them
but
since
the
point
at
issue
is
precisely
the
most
universally
defining
trait
of
existence
as
known
the
invitation
deliberately
to
disregard
the
most
universal
trait
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
invitation
to
philosophic
suicide
if
the
idealist
i
have
imagined
as
making
the
foregoing
retort
were
up
in
recent
realistic
literature
he
might
add
the
following
argument
you
my
realistic
opponent
say
that
the
doctrine
of
the
external
relation
of
terms
expresses
a
ubiquitous
mark
of
every
genuine
proposition
or
relational
complex
and
that
this
ubiquity
is
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
realism
why
so
uneven
so
partial
in
your
attitude
toward
ubiquitous
relations
is
it
perchance
that
you
were
so
uneasy
at
our
possession
of
a
ubiquitous
relation
that
gives
a
short
cut
to
idealism
that
you
felt
you
must
also
have
a
short
cut
to
realism
if
i
terminate
the
controversy
at
this
point
it
is
not
because
i
think
the
realist
is
unable
to
come
back
on
the
contrary
i
stop
here
because
i
believe
for
reasons
that
will
come
out
shortly
that
both
realist
and
idealist
having
the
same
primary
assumption
can
come
back
at
each
other
indefinitely
consequently
i
wish
to
employ
the
existence
of
this
controversy
to
raise
the
question
under
what
conditions
is
the
relation
of
knower
to
known
an
intelligible
question
and
i
wish
to
show
that
it
is
intelligible
if
the
knowledge
relation
be
ubiquitous
and
homogeneous
the
controversy
back
and
forth
is
in
fact
a
warning
of
each
side
by
the
other
not
to
depart
from
their
premise
if
the
idealist
begins
to
argue
as
he
constantly
does
as
if
the
relation
to
mind
or
to
consciousness
made
some
difference
of
a
specific
sort
like
that
between
error
and
fact
or
between
sound
perception
and
hallucination
he
may
be
reminded
that
since
this
relation
is
uniform
it
substantiates
and
nullifies
all
things
alike
and
the
realist
is
quite
within
the
common
premise
when
he
points
out
that
every
special
fact
must
be
admitted
for
what
it
is
specifically
known
to
be
no
idealistic
doctrine
can
turn
the
edge
of
the
fact
that
knowledge
has
evolved
historically
out
of
a
state
in
which
there
was
no
mind
or
of
the
fact
that
knowledge
is
even
now
dependent
on
the
brain
provided
that
specific
evidence
shows
these
to
be
facts
the
realist
on
the
other
hand
must
admit
that
after
all
the
entire
body
of
known
facts
or
of
science
including
such
facts
as
the
above
is
held
fast
and
tight
in
the
net
of
relation
to
a
mind
or
consciousness
in
specific
cases
this
relation
may
be
ignored
but
the
exact
ground
for
such
an
ignoring
is
precisely
that
the
relation
is
not
a
specific
fact
but
a
uniform
relation
of
facts
and
to
call
it
an
external
relation
makes
no
practical
difference
if
it
is
universal
and
uniform
so
the
idealist
might
reply
imagine
a
situation
like
the
following
the
sole
relation
an
organism
bears
to
things
is
that
of
eater
the
sole
relation
the
environment
bears
to
the
organism
is
that
of
food
that
is
this
relation
then
is
exhaustive
it
defines
or
identifies
each
term
in
relation
to
the
other
but
this
means
that
there
are
not
as
respects
organism
and
environment
two
terms
at
all
and
are
two
names
for
one
and
the
same
situation
could
there
be
imagined
a
greater
absurdity
than
to
set
to
work
to
discuss
the
relation
eater
food
organism
the
environment
or
to
argue
as
to
whether
one
modifies
the
other
or
not
given
the
premise
the
statements
in
such
a
discussion
could
have
only
a
verbal
difference
from
one
another
suppose
however
the
discussion
has
somehow
got
under
way
sides
have
been
taken
the
philosophical
world
is
divided
into
two
great
camps
foodists
and
eaterists
the
eaterists
idealists
contend
that
no
object
exists
except
in
relation
to
eating
hence
that
everything
is
constituted
a
thing
by
its
relation
to
eating
special
sciences
exist
indeed
which
discuss
the
nature
of
various
sorts
of
things
in
relation
to
and
hence
in
legitimate
abstraction
from
the
fact
that
they
are
all
foods
but
the
discussion
of
their
nature
depends
upon
eatology
which
deals
primarily
with
the
problem
of
the
possibility
nature
and
extent
or
limits
of
eating
food
in
general
and
thereby
determines
what
food
in
general
is
and
means
nay
replies
the
foodist
realist
since
the
eating
relation
is
uniform
it
is
negligible
all
propositions
which
have
any
intelligible
meaning
are
about
objects
just
as
they
are
and
in
the
relations
they
bear
to
one
another
foods
pass
in
and
out
of
the
relation
to
eater
with
no
change
in
their
own
traits
moreover
the
position
of
the
eaterists
is
how
can
a
thing
be
eaten
unless
it
is
in
and
of
itself
a
food
to
suppose
that
a
food
is
constituted
by
eating
is
to
presuppose
that
eating
eats
eating
and
so
on
in
infinite
regress
in
short
to
be
an
eater
is
to
be
an
eater
of
food
take
away
the
independent
existence
of
foods
and
you
deny
the
existence
and
the
possibility
of
an
eater
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
no
terminus
to
such
a
discussion
for
either
both
sides
are
saying
the
same
thing
in
different
words
or
else
both
of
them
depart
from
their
common
premise
and
unwittingly
smuggle
in
some
relations
between
the
organism
and
environment
other
than
that
of
if
to
be
an
eater
means
that
an
organism
which
is
more
and
other
than
an
eater
is
doing
something
because
contrasting
with
its
other
functions
in
eating
then
and
then
only
is
there
an
issue
in
this
latter
case
the
thing
which
is
food
may
of
course
be
to
be
something
besides
food
because
of
some
different
relation
to
the
organism
than
that
of
eating
but
if
both
stick
consistently
to
their
common
premise
we
get
the
following
trivial
situation
the
idealist
says
every
philosophy
purports
to
be
knowledge
knowledge
of
objects
all
knowledge
implies
relation
to
mind
therefore
every
object
with
which
philosophy
deals
is
the
realist
says
to
be
a
mind
is
to
be
a
knower
to
be
a
knower
is
to
be
a
without
the
objects
to
be
known
mind
the
knower
is
and
means
nothing
the
difficulties
attending
the
discussion
of
epistemology
are
in
no
way
attendant
upon
the
special
of
epistemology
they
are
found
wherever
any
reciprocal
relation
is
taken
to
define
exclusively
and
exhaustively
all
the
connections
between
any
pair
of
things
if
there
are
two
things
that
stand
solely
as
buyer
and
seller
to
each
other
or
as
husband
and
wife
then
that
relation
is
unique
and
undefinable
to
discuss
the
relation
the
relation
the
terms
of
which
it
is
the
relation
is
an
obvious
absurdity
to
assert
that
the
relation
does
modify
the
seller
the
wife
or
the
object
known
is
to
discuss
the
relation
the
relation
just
as
much
as
to
assert
the
opposite
the
only
reason
i
think
why
anyone
has
ever
supposed
the
case
of
to
differ
from
any
case
of
an
alleged
exhaustive
and
exclusive
correlation
is
that
while
the
knower
is
only
one
just
knower
the
objects
known
are
obviously
many
and
sustain
many
relations
to
one
another
which
vary
independently
of
their
relation
to
the
knower
this
is
the
undoubted
fact
at
the
bottom
of
epistemological
realism
but
the
idealist
is
entitled
to
reply
that
the
objects
in
their
variable
relations
to
one
another
nevertheless
fall
within
a
relation
to
a
knower
long
that
relation
is
regarded
by
both
as
exhaustive
or
ubiquitous
ii
nevertheless
i
do
not
conceive
that
the
realistic
assertion
and
the
idealistic
assertion
in
this
dilemma
stand
on
the
same
level
or
have
the
same
value
the
fact
that
objects
vary
in
relation
to
one
another
independently
of
their
relation
to
the
knower
a
fact
and
a
fact
recognized
by
all
schools
the
idealistic
assertion
rests
simply
upon
the
presupposition
of
the
ubiquity
of
the
knowledge
relation
and
consequently
has
only
an
force
that
is
a
force
as
against
epistemological
realists
against
those
who
admit
that
the
sole
and
exhaustive
relation
of
the
self
or
ego
to
objects
is
that
of
knower
of
them
the
relation
of
buyer
and
seller
is
a
discussable
relation
for
buyer
does
not
exhaust
one
party
and
seller
does
not
exhaust
the
other
each
is
a
man
or
a
woman
a
consumer
or
a
producer
or
a
middleman
a
or
a
merchant
a
taxpayer
or
a
voter
and
so
on
indefinitely
nor
is
it
true
that
such
additional
relations
are
borne
merely
to
things
the
are
more
than
and
other
than
to
they
may
be
belong
to
opposite
political
parties
dislike
each
other
looks
and
be
second
cousins
hence
the
relation
stands
in
intelligent
connection
and
contrast
with
other
relations
so
that
it
can
be
discriminated
defined
analyzed
moreover
there
are
specific
differences
the
relation
because
it
is
not
ubiquitous
it
is
not
homogeneous
if
wealthy
and
a
householder
the
one
who
buys
is
a
different
buyer
buys
differently
than
if
poor
and
a
boarder
consequently
the
seller
sells
differently
has
more
or
less
goods
left
to
sell
more
or
less
income
to
expend
on
other
things
and
so
on
indefinitely
moreover
in
order
to
be
a
buyer
the
man
has
to
other
things
he
is
not
a
buyer
but
a
buyer
because
he
is
an
eater
wears
clothes
is
married
etc
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
the
organism
is
something
else
than
an
eater
or
something
in
relation
to
food
alone
i
will
not
again
call
the
roll
of
perfectly
familiar
facts
i
will
lessen
my
appeal
to
the
reader
patience
by
confining
my
reiteration
to
one
point
even
in
relation
to
the
things
that
are
food
the
organism
is
something
more
than
their
eater
he
is
their
acquirer
their
pursuer
their
cultivator
their
beholder
taster
etc
he
their
eater
because
he
is
so
many
other
things
and
his
becoming
an
eater
is
a
natural
episode
in
the
natural
unfolding
of
these
other
things
precisely
the
same
sort
of
assertions
may
be
made
about
the
relation
if
the
one
who
is
knower
is
something
else
and
more
than
the
knower
of
objects
and
if
objects
are
relation
to
the
one
who
knows
something
else
and
other
than
things
in
a
knowledge
relation
there
is
somewhat
to
define
and
discuss
otherwise
we
are
raising
as
we
have
already
seen
the
quite
foolish
question
as
to
what
is
the
relation
of
a
relation
to
itself
or
the
equally
foolish
question
of
whether
being
a
thing
modifies
the
thing
that
it
is
and
moreover
epistemological
realism
and
idealism
both
say
the
same
thing
realism
that
a
thing
does
not
modify
itself
idealism
that
since
the
thing
is
what
it
is
it
stands
in
the
relation
that
it
does
stand
in
there
are
many
facts
which
prima
facie
support
the
claim
that
knowing
is
a
connection
of
things
which
depends
upon
other
and
more
primary
connections
between
a
self
and
things
a
connection
which
grows
out
of
these
more
fundamental
connections
and
which
operates
in
their
interests
at
specifiable
crises
i
will
not
repeat
what
is
so
generally
admitted
and
so
little
taken
into
account
that
knowing
is
biologically
a
differentiation
of
organic
behavior
but
will
cite
some
facts
that
are
even
more
obvious
and
even
more
neglected
if
we
take
a
case
of
perception
we
find
upon
analysis
that
so
far
as
a
self
or
organism
is
concerned
in
it
at
all
the
self
is
so
to
say
inside
of
it
rather
than
outside
of
it
it
would
be
much
more
correct
to
say
that
a
self
is
contained
in
a
perception
than
that
a
perception
is
presented
to
a
self
that
is
to
say
the
organism
is
involved
in
the
occurrence
of
the
perception
in
the
same
sort
of
way
that
hydrogen
is
involved
in
the
happening
producing
of
water
we
might
about
as
well
talk
of
the
production
of
a
specimen
of
water
as
a
presentation
of
water
to
hydrogen
as
talk
in
the
way
we
are
only
too
accustomed
to
talk
about
perceptions
and
the
organism
when
we
consider
a
perception
as
a
case
of
apperception
the
same
thing
holds
good
habits
enter
into
the
of
the
situation
they
are
in
and
of
it
not
so
far
as
it
is
concerned
something
outside
of
it
here
if
you
please
is
a
unique
relation
of
self
and
things
but
it
is
unique
not
in
being
wholly
incomparable
to
all
natural
relations
among
events
but
in
the
sense
of
being
distinctive
or
just
the
relation
that
it
is
taking
the
many
cases
where
the
self
may
be
said
in
an
intelligible
sense
to
lie
a
thing
and
hence
to
have
dealings
with
it
we
find
that
they
are
extensively
and
primarily
cases
where
the
self
is
doer
sufferer
and
enjoyer
this
means
of
course
that
things
the
things
that
later
come
to
be
known
are
primarily
not
objects
of
awareness
but
causes
of
weal
and
woe
things
to
get
and
things
to
avoid
means
and
obstacles
tools
and
results
to
a
na√Øve
spectator
the
ordinary
assumption
that
a
thing
is
in
experience
only
when
it
is
an
object
of
awareness
or
even
only
when
a
perception
is
nothing
less
than
extraordinary
the
self
experiences
whatever
it
undergoes
and
there
is
no
fact
about
life
more
assured
or
more
tragic
than
that
what
we
are
aware
of
is
determined
by
things
that
we
are
undergoing
but
of
which
we
are
not
conscious
and
which
we
can
not
be
conscious
of
under
the
particular
conditions
so
far
as
the
question
of
the
relation
of
the
self
to
known
objects
is
concerned
knowing
is
but
one
special
case
of
the
of
the
situation
it
is
however
the
case
constantly
increasing
in
relative
importance
the
connections
of
the
self
with
things
by
way
of
weal
or
woe
are
progressively
found
to
depend
upon
the
connections
established
in
knowing
things
on
the
other
hand
the
progress
the
advance
of
science
is
found
to
depend
more
and
more
upon
the
courage
and
patience
of
the
agent
in
making
the
widening
and
buttressing
of
knowledge
a
business
it
is
impossible
to
overstate
the
significance
the
reality
of
the
relation
of
self
as
knower
to
things
when
it
is
thought
of
as
a
relation
a
deliberate
and
responsible
undertaking
of
a
self
ultimately
the
modern
insistence
upon
the
self
in
reference
to
knowledge
in
contrast
with
the
classic
greek
view
will
be
found
to
reside
precisely
here
my
purpose
in
citing
the
foregoing
facts
is
not
to
prove
a
positive
point
that
there
are
many
relations
of
self
and
things
of
which
knowing
is
but
one
differentiated
case
it
concerns
something
less
obvious
showing
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
the
problems
at
issue
concern
matters
of
fact
and
are
not
matters
to
be
decided
by
assumption
definition
and
deduction
i
mean
also
to
suggest
what
kind
of
matters
of
fact
would
naturally
be
adduced
as
evidential
in
such
a
discussion
negatively
put
my
point
is
that
the
whole
question
of
the
relation
of
knower
to
known
is
radically
misconceived
in
what
passes
as
epistemology
because
of
an
underlying
unexamined
assumption
an
assumption
which
moreover
when
examined
makes
the
controversy
verbal
or
absurd
positively
put
my
point
is
that
since
prima
facie
plenty
of
connections
other
than
the
one
exist
between
self
and
things
there
is
a
context
in
which
the
problem
of
their
relation
concerns
matters
of
fact
capable
of
empirical
determination
by
inquiry
the
point
about
a
difference
being
made
or
rather
making
in
things
when
known
is
precisely
of
this
sort
iii
that
question
is
not
upon
the
assumption
of
the
ubiquity
of
the
knowledge
the
absurd
question
of
whether
knowledge
makes
any
difference
to
things
already
known
or
to
things
facts
or
truths
until
the
epistemological
realists
have
seriously
considered
the
main
propositions
of
the
pragmatic
realists
that
knowing
is
something
that
happens
to
things
in
the
natural
course
of
their
career
not
the
sudden
introduction
of
a
unique
type
of
relation
that
to
a
mind
or
consciousness
they
are
hardly
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
second
and
derived
pragmatic
proposition
that
in
this
natural
continuity
things
in
becoming
known
undergo
a
specific
and
detectable
qualitative
change
i
had
occasion
earlier
to
remark
that
if
one
identifies
knowledge
with
situations
involving
the
function
of
inference
the
of
knowledge
means
the
art
of
guiding
this
function
most
effectively
that
statement
holds
when
we
take
knowledge
as
a
relation
of
the
things
the
knowledge
situation
if
we
are
once
convinced
of
the
artificiality
of
the
notion
that
the
knowledge
relation
is
ubiquitous
there
will
be
an
existential
problem
as
to
the
self
and
knowledge
but
it
will
be
a
radically
different
problem
from
that
discussed
in
epistemology
the
relation
of
knowing
to
existence
will
be
recognized
to
form
the
of
no
problem
because
involving
an
ungrounded
and
even
absurd
preconception
but
the
problem
of
the
relation
of
an
existence
in
the
way
of
knowing
to
other
existences
or
events
with
which
it
forms
a
continuous
process
will
then
be
seen
to
be
a
natural
problem
to
be
attacked
by
natural
methods
footnote
professor
perry
says
new
professor
dewey
is
mistaken
in
supposing
that
realism
assumes
of
the
realism
does
not
argue
from
the
predicament
from
the
bare
presence
of
the
in
all
cases
of
knowledge
if
the
text
has
not
made
my
point
clear
it
is
probably
too
much
to
expect
that
a
footnote
will
do
so
but
i
have
not
accused
the
realist
of
arguing
from
the
predicament
i
have
said
that
any
realist
holds
that
the
sole
and
exclusive
relation
of
the
one
who
is
knower
to
things
is
that
of
being
their
knower
then
the
realist
can
not
the
impact
of
the
predicament
but
if
the
one
who
knows
things
also
stands
in
other
connections
with
them
then
it
is
possible
to
make
an
intelligible
contrast
between
things
as
known
and
things
as
loved
or
hated
or
appreciated
or
seen
or
heard
or
whatever
the
argument
it
should
be
noted
stands
in
connection
with
that
of
the
last
section
as
to
whether
hearing
a
sound
and
seeing
a
color
are
of
themselves
apart
from
the
use
made
of
them
in
inference
cases
of
knowledge
it
is
significant
that
perry
holds
that
sensing
is
a
case
of
knowing
hence
it
must
be
in
relation
to
a
knower
it
must
fall
within
the
predicament
for
it
makes
the
mind
aware
of
a
characteristic
of
the
environment
that
it
is
or
may
be
used
to
make
us
aware
of
some
characteristic
of
the
environment
i
of
course
hold
to
say
that
it
an
awareness
by
the
mind
of
a
characteristic
of
the
environment
is
at
once
to
involve
a
philosopher
immediately
in
the
discussion
of
whether
red
qualities
or
only
certain
vibrations
are
really
characteristics
of
the
environment
then
when
the
authority
of
physics
is
invoked
in
behalf
of
the
latter
proposition
the
epistemologist
however
realistic
in
his
intention
is
forced
to
consider
color
as
a
misapprehension
of
the
environment
a
case
of
error
or
illusion
while
the
idealist
triumphantly
flourishes
it
as
a
case
of
the
transformative
or
constitutive
efficacy
of
mind
in
knowing
but
if
the
color
is
simply
a
natural
event
and
if
mind
does
not
enter
except
when
color
is
made
the
basis
of
inference
to
some
characteristic
of
the
environment
then
there
is
no
predicament
and
there
is
no
problem
of
error
save
as
a
false
inference
is
made
moreover
since
errors
in
inference
are
an
undoubted
fact
the
principle
that
entities
are
not
to
be
multiplied
beyond
need
gives
a
prima
facie
superiority
to
any
theory
which
connects
all
error
with
inference
till
adequate
evidence
to
the
contrary
is
produced
xi
the
existence
of
the
world
as
a
logical
problem
of
the
two
parts
of
this
paper
the
first
is
a
study
in
formal
analysis
it
attempts
to
show
that
there
is
no
problem
logically
speaking
of
the
existence
of
an
external
world
its
point
is
to
show
that
the
very
attempt
to
state
the
problem
involves
a
that
the
terms
can
not
be
stated
so
as
to
generate
a
problem
without
assuming
what
is
professedly
brought
into
question
the
second
part
is
a
summary
endeavor
to
state
the
actual
question
which
has
given
rise
to
the
unreal
problem
and
the
conditions
which
have
led
to
its
being
misconstrued
so
far
as
is
concerned
it
supplements
the
first
part
but
the
argument
of
the
first
part
in
no
way
depends
upon
anything
said
in
the
second
the
latter
may
be
false
and
its
falsity
have
no
implications
for
the
first
i
there
are
many
ways
of
stating
the
problem
of
the
existence
of
an
external
world
i
shall
make
that
of
bertrand
russell
the
basis
of
my
examinations
as
it
is
set
forth
in
his
recent
book
knowledge
of
the
external
world
as
a
field
for
scientific
method
in
i
do
this
both
because
his
statement
is
one
recently
made
in
a
book
of
commanding
importance
and
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
more
careful
statement
than
most
of
those
in
vogue
if
my
point
can
be
made
out
for
his
statement
it
will
apply
a
fortiori
to
other
statements
even
if
there
be
those
to
whom
this
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
it
will
be
admitted
that
my
analysis
must
begin
somewhere
i
can
not
take
the
space
to
repeat
the
analysis
in
application
to
differing
modes
of
statement
with
a
view
to
showing
that
the
method
employed
will
yield
like
results
in
all
cases
but
i
take
the
liberty
of
throwing
the
burden
upon
the
reader
and
asking
him
to
show
cause
why
it
does
not
so
apply
after
rejecting
certain
familiar
formulations
of
the
question
because
they
employ
the
not
easily
definable
notions
of
the
self
and
independence
russell
makes
the
following
formulation
can
we
know
that
objects
of
sense
exist
at
times
when
we
are
not
perceiving
them
or
in
another
mode
of
statement
can
the
existence
of
anything
other
than
our
own
hard
data
be
inferred
from
the
existence
of
those
data
pp
and
i
shall
try
to
show
that
identification
of
the
data
of
sense
as
the
sort
of
term
which
will
generate
the
problem
involves
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
question
that
it
must
have
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
before
the
question
can
be
asked
and
this
i
take
it
is
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
question
at
all
a
point
of
departure
may
be
found
in
the
following
passage
i
think
it
must
be
admitted
as
probable
that
the
immediate
objects
of
sense
depend
for
their
existence
upon
physiological
conditions
in
ourselves
and
that
for
example
the
colored
surfaces
which
we
see
cease
to
exist
when
we
shut
our
eyes
i
have
not
quoted
the
passage
for
the
sake
of
gaining
an
easy
victory
by
pointing
out
that
this
statement
involves
the
existence
of
physiological
conditions
for
russell
himself
affirms
that
fact
as
he
points
out
such
arguments
assume
precisely
the
common
sense
world
of
stable
objects
professedly
put
in
doubt
my
purpose
is
to
ask
what
justification
there
is
for
calling
immediate
data
objects
of
sense
statements
of
this
type
always
call
color
visual
sound
auditory
and
so
on
if
it
were
merely
a
matter
of
making
certain
admissions
for
the
sake
of
being
able
to
play
a
certain
game
there
would
be
no
objection
but
if
we
are
concerned
with
a
matter
of
serious
analysis
one
is
bound
to
ask
whence
come
these
adjectives
that
color
is
visual
in
the
sense
of
being
an
object
of
vision
is
certainly
admitted
in
the
world
but
this
is
the
world
we
have
left
that
color
is
visual
is
a
proposition
about
color
and
it
is
a
proposition
which
color
itself
does
not
utter
visible
or
visual
color
is
already
a
synthetic
proposition
not
a
term
nor
an
analysis
of
a
single
term
that
color
is
seen
or
is
visible
i
do
not
call
in
question
but
i
insist
that
fact
already
assumes
an
answer
to
the
question
which
russell
has
put
it
presupposes
existence
beyond
the
color
itself
to
call
the
color
a
sensory
object
involves
another
assumption
of
the
same
kind
but
even
more
complex
involving
that
is
even
more
existence
beyond
the
color
i
see
no
reply
to
this
statement
except
to
urge
that
the
terms
visual
and
sensory
as
applied
to
the
object
are
pieces
of
verbal
supererogation
having
no
force
in
the
statement
this
supposititious
answer
brings
the
matter
to
a
focus
is
it
possible
to
institute
even
a
preliminary
disparaging
contrast
between
immediate
objects
and
a
world
external
to
them
unless
the
term
sensory
has
a
definite
effect
upon
the
meaning
assigned
to
immediate
data
or
objects
before
taking
up
this
question
i
shall
however
call
attention
to
another
implication
of
the
passage
quoted
it
appears
to
be
implied
that
existence
of
color
and
being
seen
are
equivalent
terms
at
all
events
in
similar
arguments
the
identification
is
frequently
made
but
by
description
all
that
is
required
for
the
existence
of
color
is
certain
physiological
conditions
they
may
be
present
and
color
exist
and
yet
not
be
seen
things
constantly
act
upon
the
optical
apparatus
in
a
way
which
fulfils
the
conditions
of
the
existence
of
color
without
color
being
seen
this
statement
does
not
involve
any
dubious
psychology
about
an
act
of
attention
i
only
mean
that
the
argument
implies
over
and
above
the
existence
of
color
something
called
seeing
or
perceiving
noting
is
perhaps
a
convenient
neutral
term
and
this
clearly
involves
an
assumption
of
something
beyond
the
existence
of
the
datum
and
this
datum
is
by
definition
an
external
world
without
this
assumption
the
term
immediate
could
not
be
introduced
is
the
immediate
or
is
it
the
object
of
an
immediate
noting
if
the
latter
then
the
hard
datum
already
stands
in
connection
with
something
beyond
itself
and
this
brings
us
to
a
further
point
the
sense
objects
are
repeatedly
spoken
of
as
known
for
example
it
is
obvious
that
since
the
senses
give
knowledge
of
the
latter
kind
believed
on
their
own
account
without
the
support
of
any
outside
evidence
the
immediate
facts
perceived
by
sight
or
touch
or
hearing
do
not
need
to
be
proved
by
argument
but
are
completely
again
they
are
spoken
of
as
facts
of
sense
and
as
facts
going
along
for
knowledge
with
the
laws
of
logic
i
do
not
know
what
belief
or
knowledge
means
here
nor
do
i
understand
what
is
meant
by
a
being
evidence
for
itself
but
obviously
russell
knows
and
knows
their
application
to
the
sense
object
and
here
is
a
further
assumption
of
what
by
definition
is
a
world
external
to
the
datum
again
we
have
assumed
in
getting
a
question
stated
just
what
is
professedly
called
into
question
and
the
assumption
is
not
made
the
less
simple
in
that
russell
has
defined
belief
as
a
case
of
a
triadic
relation
and
said
that
without
the
recognition
of
the
relation
the
difference
between
perception
and
belief
is
inexplicable
we
come
to
the
question
passed
over
can
such
terms
as
visual
sensory
be
neglected
without
modifying
the
force
of
the
question
that
is
without
affecting
the
implications
which
give
it
the
force
of
a
problem
can
we
know
that
objects
of
sense
or
very
similar
objects
exist
at
times
when
we
are
not
perceiving
them
secondly
if
this
can
not
be
known
can
we
know
that
other
objects
inferable
from
objects
of
sense
but
not
necessarily
resembling
them
exist
either
when
we
are
perceiving
the
objects
of
sense
or
at
any
other
time
i
think
a
little
reflection
will
make
it
clear
that
without
the
limitation
of
the
term
perceiving
by
the
term
sense
no
as
to
existence
other
can
possibly
arise
for
neither
reference
to
time
nor
limitation
to
a
particular
time
is
given
either
in
the
fact
of
existence
of
color
or
of
perceiving
color
russell
for
example
makes
allusion
to
a
patch
of
color
which
is
momentarily
seen
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
may
pass
without
challenge
in
the
world
but
hardly
in
an
analysis
which
professes
to
call
that
world
in
question
russell
makes
the
allusion
in
connection
with
discriminating
between
sensation
as
signifying
the
mental
event
of
our
being
aware
and
the
sensation
as
object
of
which
we
are
aware
the
sense
object
he
can
hardly
be
guilty
then
in
the
immediate
context
of
proceeding
to
identify
the
momentariness
of
the
event
with
the
momentariness
of
the
object
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
assuming
the
temporal
quality
of
the
object
and
that
immediateness
belongs
to
it
in
any
other
way
than
as
an
object
of
immediate
seeing
what
are
these
grounds
how
is
it
moreover
that
even
the
act
of
being
aware
is
describable
as
momentary
i
know
of
no
way
of
so
identifying
it
except
by
discovering
that
it
is
delimited
in
a
time
continuum
and
if
this
be
the
case
it
is
surely
superfluous
to
bother
about
to
other
times
they
are
assumed
in
stating
the
question
which
thus
turns
out
again
to
be
no
question
it
may
be
only
a
trivial
matter
that
russell
speaks
of
that
patch
of
color
which
is
momentarily
seen
when
we
at
the
italics
mine
i
would
not
attach
undue
importance
to
such
phrases
but
the
frequency
with
which
they
present
themselves
in
discussions
of
this
type
suggests
the
question
whether
as
matter
of
fact
the
patch
of
color
is
not
determined
by
reference
to
an
object
the
table
and
not
vice
versa
as
we
shall
see
later
there
is
good
ground
for
thinking
that
russell
is
really
engaged
not
in
bringing
into
question
the
existence
of
an
object
beyond
the
datum
but
in
the
nature
of
an
object
and
that
the
reference
to
the
patch
of
color
as
something
more
primitive
than
the
table
is
really
relevant
to
this
reconstruction
of
traditional
metaphysics
in
other
words
it
is
relevant
to
defining
an
object
as
a
constant
correlation
of
variations
in
qualities
instead
of
defining
it
as
a
substance
in
which
attributes
inhere
or
a
subject
of
predicates
if
anything
is
an
eternal
essence
it
is
surely
such
a
thing
as
color
taken
by
itself
as
by
definition
it
must
be
taken
in
the
statement
of
the
question
by
russell
anything
more
simple
timeless
and
absolute
than
a
red
can
hardly
be
thought
of
one
might
question
the
eternal
character
of
the
received
statement
of
say
the
law
of
gravitation
on
the
ground
that
it
is
so
complex
that
it
may
depend
upon
conditions
not
yet
discovered
and
the
discovery
of
which
would
involve
an
alteration
in
the
statement
if
plus
equal
be
taken
as
an
isolated
statement
it
might
be
conceived
to
depend
upon
hidden
conditions
and
to
be
alterable
with
them
but
by
conception
we
are
dealing
in
the
case
of
the
colored
surface
with
an
ultimate
simple
datum
it
can
have
no
implications
beyond
itself
no
concealed
dependencies
how
then
can
its
existence
even
if
its
perception
be
but
momentary
raise
a
question
of
other
times
at
all
suppose
a
perceived
blue
surface
to
be
replaced
by
a
perceived
red
surface
and
it
will
be
conceded
that
the
change
or
replacement
is
also
perceived
there
is
still
no
ground
for
a
belief
in
the
temporally
limited
duration
of
either
the
red
or
the
blue
surface
anything
that
leads
to
this
conclusion
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
number
two
ceases
when
we
turn
to
think
of
an
atom
there
is
no
way
then
of
escaping
the
conclusion
that
the
adjective
sense
in
the
term
sense
object
is
not
taken
innocently
it
is
taken
as
qualifying
for
the
purposes
of
statement
of
the
problem
the
nature
of
the
object
aside
from
reference
to
the
momentariness
of
the
event
a
reference
which
is
expressly
ruled
out
there
is
no
way
of
introducing
delimited
temporal
existence
into
the
object
save
by
reference
to
one
and
the
same
object
which
is
perceived
at
different
times
to
have
different
qualities
if
the
same
object
however
object
be
defined
is
perceived
to
be
of
one
color
at
one
time
and
of
another
color
at
another
time
then
as
a
matter
of
course
the
of
either
the
earlier
or
later
time
is
identified
as
of
transitory
duration
but
equally
of
course
there
is
no
question
of
to
other
times
other
times
have
already
been
used
to
describe
define
and
delimit
brief
time
a
moderate
amount
of
unbiased
reflection
will
i
am
confident
convince
anyone
that
apart
from
a
reference
to
the
same
existence
perduring
through
different
times
while
changing
in
respect
no
temporal
delimitation
of
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
as
sound
or
color
can
be
made
even
plato
never
doubted
the
eternal
nature
of
red
he
only
argued
from
the
fact
that
a
is
red
at
one
time
and
blue
at
another
to
the
unstable
and
hence
phenomenal
character
of
the
or
put
in
a
different
way
we
can
know
that
a
red
is
a
momentary
or
transitory
existence
only
if
we
know
of
other
things
which
determine
its
beginning
and
cessation
russell
gives
a
specific
illustration
of
what
he
takes
to
be
the
correct
way
of
stating
the
question
in
an
account
of
what
in
the
universe
of
discourse
would
be
termed
walking
around
a
table
if
we
exclude
considerations
to
which
we
have
apart
from
assuming
just
the
things
which
are
doubtful
no
right
the
datum
turns
out
to
be
something
to
be
stated
as
follows
what
is
really
known
is
a
correlation
of
muscular
and
other
bodily
sensations
with
changes
in
visual
sensations
by
sensations
must
be
meant
sensible
objects
not
mental
events
this
statement
repeats
the
point
already
dealt
with
muscular
visual
and
other
bodily
are
all
terms
which
are
indispensable
and
which
also
assume
the
very
thing
professedly
brought
into
question
the
external
world
as
that
was
defined
really
known
assumes
both
noting
and
belief
with
whatever
complex
implications
they
may
involve
implications
which
for
all
that
appears
to
the
contrary
may
be
indefinitely
complex
and
which
by
russell
own
statement
involve
relationship
to
at
least
two
other
terms
besides
the
datum
but
in
addition
there
appears
the
new
term
correlation
i
can
not
avoid
the
conclusion
that
this
term
involves
an
acknowledgment
of
the
external
world
note
in
the
first
place
that
the
correlation
in
question
is
not
simple
it
is
threefold
being
a
correlation
of
correlations
the
changes
in
visual
sensations
objects
must
be
correlated
in
a
temporal
continuum
the
muscular
and
other
bodily
sensations
objects
must
also
constitute
a
connected
series
one
set
of
changes
belongs
to
the
serial
class
visual
the
other
set
to
the
serial
class
muscular
and
these
two
classes
sustain
a
correspondence
to
each
other
they
are
correlated
i
am
not
raising
the
old
question
of
how
such
complex
correlations
can
be
said
to
be
either
given
or
known
in
sense
though
it
is
worth
a
passing
notice
that
it
was
on
account
of
this
sort
of
phenomenon
that
kant
postulated
his
threefold
intellectual
synthesis
of
apprehension
reproduction
and
recognition
in
conception
and
that
it
is
upon
the
basis
of
necessity
for
such
correlations
that
the
rationalists
have
always
criticized
sensationalist
empiricism
personally
i
agree
that
temporal
and
spatial
qualities
are
quite
as
much
given
in
experience
as
are
particulars
in
fact
as
i
have
been
trying
to
show
particulars
can
be
identified
particulars
only
in
a
relational
complex
my
point
is
rather
i
that
any
such
given
is
already
precisely
what
is
meant
by
the
world
and
ii
that
such
a
highly
specified
correlation
as
russell
here
sets
forth
is
in
no
case
a
psychological
or
historical
primitive
but
is
a
primitive
arrived
at
by
an
analysis
of
an
empirical
complex
i
the
statement
involves
the
assumption
of
two
temporal
spreads
which
moreover
are
determinately
specified
as
to
their
constituent
elements
and
as
to
their
order
and
these
sustain
to
each
other
a
correlation
element
to
element
the
elements
moreover
are
all
specifically
qualitative
and
some
of
them
at
least
are
spatial
how
this
differs
from
the
external
world
of
i
am
totally
unable
to
see
it
may
not
be
a
very
big
external
world
but
having
begged
a
small
external
world
i
do
not
see
why
one
should
be
too
squeamish
about
extending
it
over
the
edges
the
reply
i
suppose
is
that
this
complex
defined
and
ordered
object
is
by
conception
the
object
of
a
single
perception
so
that
the
question
remains
as
to
the
possibility
of
inferring
from
it
to
something
beyond
but
the
reply
only
throws
us
back
upon
the
point
previously
made
a
particular
or
single
event
of
perceptual
awareness
can
be
as
to
its
ingredients
and
structure
only
in
a
continuum
of
objects
that
is
the
series
of
changes
in
color
and
shape
can
be
determined
as
just
such
and
such
an
ordered
series
of
specific
elements
with
a
determinate
beginning
and
end
only
in
respect
to
a
temporal
continuum
of
things
anteceding
and
succeeding
moreover
the
determination
involves
an
analysis
which
disentangles
qualities
and
shapes
from
contemporaneously
given
objects
which
are
irrelevant
in
a
word
russell
object
already
extends
beyond
itself
it
already
belongs
to
a
larger
world
ii
a
sensible
object
which
can
be
described
as
a
correlation
of
an
ordered
series
of
shapes
and
colors
with
an
ordered
series
of
muscular
and
other
bodily
objects
presents
a
definition
of
an
object
not
a
psychological
datum
what
is
stated
is
the
definition
of
an
object
of
any
object
in
the
world
barring
ambiguities
in
the
terms
muscular
and
bodily
it
seems
to
be
an
excellent
definition
but
good
definition
or
poor
it
states
what
a
datum
is
to
be
as
an
object
in
a
known
system
definite
correlations
of
specified
and
ordered
elements
as
a
definition
it
is
general
it
is
not
made
from
the
standpoint
of
any
particular
percipient
it
says
there
be
any
percipient
at
a
specified
position
in
a
space
continuum
the
object
may
be
perceived
as
such
and
such
and
this
implies
that
a
percipient
at
any
position
in
the
space
continuum
can
deduce
from
the
known
system
of
correlations
just
what
the
series
of
shapes
and
colors
will
be
from
another
position
for
as
we
have
seen
the
correlation
of
the
series
of
changes
of
shape
assumes
a
spatial
continuum
hence
one
perspective
projection
may
be
correlated
with
that
of
any
position
in
the
continuum
i
have
no
direct
concern
with
russell
solution
of
his
problem
but
if
the
prior
analysis
is
correct
one
may
anticipate
in
advance
that
it
will
consist
simply
in
making
explicit
the
assumptions
which
have
tacitly
been
made
in
stating
the
problem
subject
to
the
conditions
involved
in
failure
to
recognize
that
they
have
been
made
and
i
think
an
analytic
reading
of
the
solution
will
bear
out
the
following
statement
his
various
peculiar
private
points
of
view
and
their
perspectives
are
nothing
but
names
for
the
positions
and
projectional
perspectives
of
the
ordinary
space
of
the
public
worlds
their
correlation
by
likeness
is
nothing
but
the
explicit
recognition
that
they
are
all
defined
and
located
from
the
start
in
one
common
spatial
continuum
one
quotation
must
suffice
if
two
men
are
sitting
in
a
room
two
somewhat
similar
worlds
are
perceived
by
them
if
a
third
man
enters
and
sits
between
them
a
third
world
intermediate
between
the
two
others
begins
to
be
perceived
pp
pray
what
is
this
room
and
what
defines
the
position
standpoint
and
perspective
of
the
two
men
and
the
standpoint
intermediate
between
them
if
the
room
and
all
the
positions
and
perspectives
which
they
determine
are
only
within
say
russell
private
world
that
private
world
is
interestingly
complex
but
it
gives
only
the
original
problem
over
again
not
a
solution
of
it
it
is
a
long
way
from
likenesses
a
private
world
to
likenesses
private
worlds
and
if
the
worlds
are
all
private
pray
who
judges
their
likeness
or
unlikeness
this
sort
of
thing
makes
one
conclude
that
russell
actual
procedure
is
the
reverse
of
his
professed
one
he
really
starts
with
one
room
as
a
spatial
continuum
within
which
different
positions
and
projections
are
determined
and
which
are
readily
correlated
with
one
another
just
because
they
are
projections
from
positions
within
one
and
the
same
having
employed
this
he
then
can
assign
different
positions
to
different
percipients
and
institute
a
comparison
between
what
each
perceives
and
pass
upon
the
extent
of
the
likeness
which
exists
between
them
what
is
the
bearing
of
this
account
upon
the
empirical
datum
just
this
the
correlation
of
correlative
series
of
changes
which
defines
the
object
of
sense
perception
is
in
no
sense
an
original
historic
or
psychologic
datum
it
signifies
the
result
of
an
analysis
of
the
usual
crude
empirical
data
and
an
analysis
which
is
made
possible
only
by
a
very
complex
knowledge
of
the
world
it
marks
not
a
primitive
psychologic
datum
but
an
outcome
a
limit
of
analysis
of
a
vast
amount
of
empirical
objects
the
definition
of
an
object
as
a
correlation
of
various
subcorrelations
of
changes
represents
a
great
advance
so
it
seems
to
me
over
the
definition
of
an
object
as
a
number
of
adjectives
stuck
into
a
substantive
but
it
represents
an
improved
definition
made
possible
by
the
advance
of
scientific
knowledge
about
the
world
it
is
a
definition
not
only
wholly
independent
of
the
context
in
which
russell
arrives
at
it
but
is
one
which
once
more
and
finally
assumes
extensive
and
accurate
knowledge
of
just
the
world
professedly
called
into
question
ii
i
have
come
to
the
point
of
transition
to
the
other
part
of
my
paper
a
formal
analysis
is
necessarily
dialectical
in
character
as
an
empiricist
i
share
in
the
dissatisfaction
which
even
the
most
correct
dialectical
discussion
is
likely
to
arouse
when
brought
to
bear
on
matters
of
fact
i
do
not
doubt
that
readers
will
feel
that
some
of
an
important
character
in
russell
statement
has
been
left
untouched
by
the
previous
analysis
even
upon
the
supposition
that
the
criticisms
are
just
particularly
will
it
be
felt
i
think
that
psychology
affords
to
his
statement
of
the
problem
a
support
of
fact
not
affected
by
any
logical
treatment
for
this
reason
i
append
a
summary
statement
as
to
the
facts
which
are
misconstrued
by
any
statement
which
makes
the
existence
of
the
world
problematic
i
do
not
believe
a
psychologist
would
go
as
far
as
to
admit
that
a
definite
correlation
of
elements
as
specific
and
ordered
as
that
of
russell
statement
is
a
primitive
psychological
datum
many
would
doubtless
hold
that
patches
of
colored
extensity
sounds
kinaesthetic
qualities
are
psychologically
much
more
primitive
than
say
a
table
to
say
nothing
of
a
group
of
objects
in
space
or
a
series
of
events
in
time
they
would
say
accordingly
that
there
is
a
real
problem
as
to
how
we
infer
or
construct
the
latter
on
the
basis
of
the
former
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
deny
that
their
own
knowledge
of
the
existence
and
nature
of
the
ultimate
and
irreducible
qualities
of
sense
is
the
product
of
a
long
careful
and
elaborate
analysis
to
which
the
sciences
of
physiology
anatomy
and
controlled
processes
of
experimental
observation
have
contributed
the
ordinary
method
of
reconciling
these
two
seemingly
inconsistent
positions
is
to
assume
that
the
original
sensible
data
of
experience
as
they
occurred
in
infancy
have
been
overlaid
by
all
kinds
of
associations
and
inferential
constructions
so
that
it
is
now
a
work
of
intellectual
art
to
recover
them
in
their
innocent
purity
now
i
might
urge
that
as
matter
of
fact
the
reconstruction
of
the
experience
of
infancy
is
itself
an
inference
from
present
experience
of
an
objective
world
and
hence
can
not
be
employed
to
make
a
problem
out
of
the
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
that
world
but
such
a
retort
involves
just
the
dialectic
excursus
which
i
am
here
anxious
to
avoid
i
am
on
ground
when
i
point
out
that
the
assumption
that
even
infancy
begins
with
such
highly
discriminated
particulars
as
those
enumerated
is
not
only
highly
dubious
but
has
been
challenged
by
eminent
psychologists
according
to
james
for
example
the
original
datum
is
large
but
confused
and
specific
sensible
qualities
represent
the
result
of
discriminations
in
this
case
the
elementary
data
instead
of
being
primitive
empirical
data
are
the
last
terms
the
limits
of
the
discriminations
we
have
been
able
to
make
that
knowledge
grows
from
a
confusedly
experienced
external
world
to
a
world
experienced
as
ordered
and
specified
would
then
be
the
teaching
of
psychological
science
but
at
no
point
would
the
mind
be
confronted
with
the
problem
of
inferring
a
world
into
the
arguments
in
behalf
of
such
a
psychology
of
original
experience
i
shall
not
go
beyond
pointing
out
the
extreme
improbability
in
view
of
what
is
known
about
instincts
and
about
the
nervous
system
that
the
is
a
quality
corresponding
to
the
functioning
of
a
single
sense
organ
much
less
of
a
single
neuronic
unit
of
a
sense
organ
if
one
adds
as
a
hypothesis
that
even
the
most
rudimentary
conscious
experience
contains
within
itself
the
element
of
suggestion
or
expectation
it
will
be
granted
that
the
object
of
conscious
experience
even
with
an
infant
is
homogeneous
with
the
world
of
the
adult
one
may
be
unwilling
to
concede
the
hypothesis
but
no
one
can
deny
that
inference
from
one
thing
to
another
is
itself
an
empirical
event
and
that
just
as
soon
as
such
inference
occurs
even
in
the
simplest
form
of
anticipation
and
prevision
a
world
exists
like
in
kind
to
that
of
the
adult
i
can
not
think
that
it
is
a
trivial
coincidence
that
psychological
analysis
of
sense
perception
came
into
existence
along
with
that
method
of
experimentally
controlled
observation
which
marks
the
beginning
of
modern
science
modern
science
did
not
begin
with
discovery
of
any
new
kind
of
inference
it
began
with
the
recognition
of
the
need
of
different
data
if
inference
is
to
proceed
safely
it
was
contended
that
starting
with
the
ordinary
or
customary
objects
of
perception
hopelessly
compromised
in
advance
the
work
of
inference
and
classification
hence
the
demand
for
an
experimental
resolution
of
the
objects
in
order
to
get
data
less
ambiguous
more
minute
and
more
extensive
increasing
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
the
nervous
system
fell
in
with
increased
knowledge
of
other
objects
to
make
possible
a
discrimination
of
specific
qualities
in
all
their
diversity
it
brought
to
light
that
habits
individual
and
social
through
influence
on
the
formation
of
individual
habits
were
large
factors
in
determining
the
accepted
or
current
system
of
objects
it
was
brought
to
light
in
other
words
that
factors
of
chance
habit
and
other
factors
were
greater
influences
than
intellectual
inquiry
in
determining
what
men
currently
believed
about
the
world
what
psychological
analysis
contributed
was
then
not
primitive
historic
data
out
of
which
a
world
had
somehow
to
be
extracted
but
an
analysis
of
the
world
which
had
been
previously
thought
of
and
believed
in
into
data
making
possible
better
inferences
and
beliefs
about
the
world
analysis
of
the
influences
customarily
determining
belief
and
inference
was
a
powerful
force
in
the
movement
to
improve
knowledge
of
the
world
this
statement
of
matters
of
fact
bears
out
it
will
be
observed
the
conclusions
of
the
dialectical
analysis
that
brought
out
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
and
elementary
data
of
sense
perception
are
identified
and
described
as
limiting
elements
in
a
complex
world
what
is
now
added
is
that
such
an
identification
of
elements
marks
a
significant
addition
to
the
resources
of
the
technique
of
inquiry
devoted
to
improving
knowledge
of
the
world
when
these
data
are
isolated
from
their
logical
status
and
office
they
are
inevitably
treated
as
and
they
leave
upon
our
hands
the
insoluble
because
problem
of
deriving
from
them
the
world
of
and
science
taken
for
what
they
really
are
they
are
elements
detected
the
world
and
serving
to
guide
and
check
our
inferences
about
it
they
are
never
particulars
they
are
always
even
as
crudely
given
connected
with
other
things
in
experience
but
analysis
gets
them
in
the
form
where
they
are
keys
to
much
more
significant
relations
in
short
the
particulars
of
perception
taken
as
complete
and
independent
make
nonsense
taken
as
objects
discriminated
for
the
purposes
of
improving
reorganizing
and
testing
knowledge
of
the
world
they
are
invaluable
assets
the
material
fallacy
lying
behind
the
formal
fallacy
which
the
first
part
of
this
paper
noted
is
the
failure
to
recognize
that
what
is
doubtful
is
not
the
existence
of
the
world
but
the
validity
of
certain
customary
yet
inferential
beliefs
about
things
in
it
it
is
not
the
which
is
doubtful
or
which
is
inferential
but
as
a
complex
of
beliefs
about
specific
things
and
relations
the
world
hence
never
in
any
actual
procedure
of
inquiry
do
we
throw
the
existence
of
the
world
into
doubt
nor
can
we
do
so
without
we
doubt
some
received
piece
of
knowledge
about
some
specific
thing
of
that
world
and
then
set
to
work
as
best
we
can
to
rectify
it
the
contribution
of
psychological
science
to
determining
unambiguous
data
and
eliminating
the
irrelevant
influences
of
passion
and
habit
which
control
the
inferences
of
is
an
important
aid
in
the
technique
of
such
rectifications
footnotes
i
shall
pass
over
the
terms
our
own
so
far
as
specific

is
concerned

employed
applies

the
statement
when
i
speak

i
mean
that
a

has
a

or
that
certain
things
have
a

in
view
of
the
assumption
shared
by
russell
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
knowledge
the
conception
that
a

offers
evidence
for

needs

is
merely
a
convenient
term
for
disguising
the
difference
between
the
indubitably
given
and
the
believed

sometimes
that
is
obviously
present
for
just
what
they
are
but
they
are
still
hypotheses
and
to
offer
their
character
as

would
expose
one
to
ridicule

be
the
cartesian
clear

term

either

beyond
the
reply
implies
that
the
exhaustive
perception
of
the
entire
universe
assumed
by
some
idealistic
writers
does
not
involve
any
external
world
i
do
not
make
this
remark
for
the
sake
of
identifying
myself
with
this
school
of
thinkers
but
to
suggest
that
the
limited
character
of
empirical
data
is
what
occasions
inference
but
it
is
a
fallacy
to
suppose
that
the
nature
of
the
limitations
is
psychologically
given
on
the
contrary
they
have
to
be
determined
by
descriptive
identifications
which
involve
reference
to
the
more
extensive
world
hence
no
matter
how
the
existence
of
the
data
may
be
it
is
never
that
they
are
rightly
delimited
with
respect
to
the
specific
inference
in
process
of
making
the
ambiguities
reside
in
the
possibility
of
treating
the
muscular
and
other
bodily
sensations
as
meaning
something
other
than
data
of
motion
and
corporealness
however
these
be
defined
muscular
sensation
may
be
an
awareness
of
motion
of
the
muscles
but
the
phrase
of
the
muscles
does
not
alter
the
nature
of
motion
as
motion
it
only
specifies
motion
is
involved
and
the
long
controversy
about
the
existence
of
immediate
muscular
sensations
testifies
to
what
a
complex
cognitive
determination
we
are
here
dealing
with
anatomical
directions
and
long
experimentation
were
required
to
answer
the
question
were
they
psychologically
primitive
data
no
such
questions
could
ever
have
arisen
xii
what
pragmatism
means
by
practical
pragmatism
according
to
james
is
a
temper
of
mind
an
attitude
it
is
also
a
theory
of
the
nature
of
ideas
and
truth
and
finally
it
is
a
theory
about
reality
it
is
pragmatism
as
method
which
is
emphasized
i
take
it
in
the
subtitle
a
new
name
for
some
old
ways
of
thinking
it
is
this
aspect
which
i
suppose
to
be
uppermost
in
james
own
mind
one
frequently
gets
the
impression
that
he
conceives
the
discussion
of
the
other
two
points
to
be
illustrative
material
more
or
less
hypothetical
of
the
method
the
briefest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
comprehensive
formula
for
the
method
is
the
attitude
of
looking
away
from
first
things
principles
supposed
necessities
and
of
looking
towards
last
things
fruits
consequences
facts
pp
and
as
the
attitude
looked
away
from
is
the
rationalistic
perhaps
the
chief
aim
of
the
lectures
is
to
exemplify
some
typical
differences
resulting
from
taking
one
outlook
or
the
other
but
pragmatism
is
used
in
a
still
wider
sense
as
meaning
also
a
certain
theory
of
truth
it
is
a
genetic
theory
of
what
is
meant
by
truth
truth
means
as
a
matter
of
course
agreement
correspondence
of
idea
and
fact
but
what
do
agreement
correspondence
mean
with
rationalism
they
mean
a
static
inert
relation
which
is
so
ultimate
that
of
it
nothing
more
can
be
said
with
pragmatism
they
signify
the
guiding
or
leading
power
of
ideas
by
which
we
dip
into
the
particulars
of
experience
again
and
if
by
its
aid
we
set
up
the
arrangements
and
connections
among
experienced
objects
which
the
idea
intends
the
idea
is
verified
it
corresponds
with
the
things
it
means
to
square
with
pp
the
idea
is
true
which
works
in
leading
us
to
what
it
purports
p
or
any
idea
that
will
carry
us
prosperously
from
any
one
part
of
experience
to
any
other
part
linking
things
satisfactorily
working
securely
simplifying
saving
labor
is
true
for
just
so
much
true
in
so
far
forth
this
notion
presupposes
that
ideas
are
essentially
intentions
plans
and
methods
and
that
what
they
as
ideas
ultimately
intend
is
certain
changes
in
prior
existing
things
this
contrasts
again
with
rationalism
with
its
copy
theory
where
ideas
ideas
are
ineffective
and
impotent
since
they
mean
only
to
mirror
a
reality
complete
without
them
thus
we
are
led
to
the
third
aspect
of
pragmatism
the
alternative
between
rationalism
and
pragmatism
concerns
the
structure
of
the
universe
itself
the
essential
contrast
is
that
reality
for
pragmatism
is
still
in
the
making
and
in
a
recent
number
of
the
of
philosophy
psychology
and
scientific
he
says
i
was
primarily
concerned
in
my
lectures
with
contrasting
the
belief
that
the
world
is
still
in
the
process
of
making
with
the
belief
that
there
is
an
eternal
edition
of
it
and
complete
i
it
will
be
following
james
example
i
think
if
we
here
regard
pragmatism
as
primarily
a
method
and
treat
the
account
of
ideas
and
their
truth
and
of
reality
somewhat
incidentally
so
far
as
the
discussion
of
them
serves
to
exemplify
or
enforce
the
method
regarding
the
attitude
of
orientation
which
looks
to
outcomes
and
consequences
one
readily
sees
that
it
has
as
james
points
out
points
of
contact
with
historic
empiricism
nominalism
and
utilitarianism
it
insists
that
general
notions
shall
cash
in
as
particular
objects
and
qualities
in
experience
that
principles
are
ultimately
subsumed
under
facts
rather
than
the
reverse
that
the
empirical
consequence
rather
than
the
a
priori
basis
is
the
sanctioning
and
warranting
factor
but
all
of
these
ideas
are
colored
and
transformed
by
the
dominant
influence
of
experimental
science
the
method
of
treating
conceptions
theories
as
working
hypotheses
as
directors
for
certain
experiments
and
experimental
observations
pragmatism
as
attitude
represents
what
peirce
has
happily
termed
the
laboratory
habit
of
mind
extended
into
every
area
where
inquiry
may
fruitfully
be
carried
on
a
scientist
would
i
think
wonder
not
so
much
at
the
method
as
at
the
lateness
of
philosophy
conversion
to
what
has
made
science
what
it
is
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
to
forecast
the
intellectual
change
that
would
proceed
from
carrying
the
method
sincerely
and
unreservedly
into
all
fields
of
inquiry
leaving
philosophy
out
of
account
what
a
change
would
be
wrought
in
the
historical
and
social
sciences
in
the
conceptions
of
politics
and
law
and
political
economy
james
does
not
claim
too
much
when
he
says
the
center
of
gravity
of
philosophy
must
alter
its
place
the
earth
of
things
long
thrown
into
shadow
by
the
glories
of
the
upper
ether
must
resume
its
rights
it
will
be
an
alteration
in
the
of
authority
that
reminds
one
almost
of
the
protestant
reformation
i
can
imagine
that
many
would
not
accept
this
method
in
philosophy
for
very
diverse
reasons
perhaps
among
the
most
potent
of
which
is
lack
of
faith
in
the
power
of
the
elements
and
processes
of
experience
and
life
to
guarantee
their
own
security
and
prosperity
because
that
is
of
the
feeling
that
the
world
of
experience
is
so
unstable
mistaken
and
fragmentary
that
it
must
have
an
absolutely
permanent
true
and
complete
ground
i
can
not
imagine
however
that
so
much
uncertainty
and
controversy
as
actually
exists
should
arise
about
the
content
and
import
of
the
doctrine
on
the
basis
of
the
general
formula
it
is
when
the
method
is
applied
to
special
points
that
questions
arise
james
reminds
us
in
his
preface
that
the
pragmatic
movement
has
found
expression
from
so
many
points
of
view
that
much
unconcerted
statement
has
resulted
and
speaking
of
his
lectures
he
goes
on
to
say
i
have
sought
to
unify
the
picture
as
it
presents
itself
to
my
own
eyes
dealing
in
broad
strokes
the
different
points
of
view
here
spoken
of
have
concerned
themselves
with
viewing
pragmatically
a
number
of
different
things
and
it
is
i
think
james
effort
to
combine
them
as
they
stand
which
occasions
misunderstanding
among
james
readers
james
himself
applied
it
for
example
in
to
philosophic
controversies
to
indicate
what
they
mean
in
terms
of
practical
issues
at
stake
before
that
peirce
himself
in
had
applied
the
method
to
the
proper
way
of
and
defining
objects
then
it
has
been
applied
to
in
order
to
find
out
what
they
mean
in
terms
of
what
they
intend
and
what
and
how
they
must
intend
in
order
to
be
true
again
it
has
been
applied
to
to
what
men
actually
accept
hold
to
and
affirm
indeed
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
pragmatism
that
it
should
be
applied
as
widely
as
possible
and
to
things
as
diverse
as
controversies
beliefs
truths
ideas
and
objects
but
yet
the
situations
and
problems
diverse
so
much
so
that
while
the
meaning
of
each
may
be
told
on
the
basis
of
last
things
fruits
consequences
facts
is
quite
certain
that
the
specific
last
things
and
facts
will
be
very
different
in
the
diverse
cases
and
that
very
different
types
of
meaning
will
stand
meaning
will
itself
something
quite
different
in
the
case
of
objects
from
what
it
will
mean
in
the
case
of
ideas
and
for
ideas
something
different
from
truths
now
the
explanation
to
which
i
have
been
led
of
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
contemporary
pragmatic
discussion
is
that
in
composing
these
different
points
of
view
into
a
single
pictorial
whole
the
distinct
type
of
consequence
and
hence
of
meaning
of
practical
appropriate
to
each
has
not
been
sufficiently
emphasized
when
we
consider
separately
the
subjects
to
which
the
pragmatic
method
has
been
applied
we
find
that
james
has
provided
the
necessary
formula
for
each
with
his
instinct
for
the
concrete
we
take
first
the
question
of
the
significance
of
an
object
the
meaning
which
should
properly
be
contained
in
its
conception
or
definition
to
attain
perfect
clearness
in
our
thoughts
of
an
object
then
we
need
only
consider
what
conceivable
effects
of
a
practical
kind
the
object
may
involve
what
sensations
we
are
to
expect
from
it
and
what
reactions
we
must
prepare
pp
or
more
shortly
as
it
is
quoted
from
ostwald
all
realities
influence
our
practice
and
that
influence
is
their
meaning
for
us
here
it
will
be
noted
that
the
start
is
from
objects
already
empirically
given
or
presented
existentially
vouched
for
and
the
question
is
as
to
their
proper
conception
what
is
the
proper
meaning
or
idea
of
an
object
and
the
meaning
is
the
effects
given
objects
one
might
doubt
the
correctness
of
this
theory
but
i
do
not
see
how
one
could
doubt
its
import
or
could
accuse
it
of
subjectivism
or
idealism
since
the
object
with
its
power
to
produce
effects
is
assumed
meaning
is
expressly
distinguished
from
objects
not
confused
with
them
as
in
idealism
and
is
said
to
consist
in
the
practical
reactions
objects
exact
of
us
or
impose
upon
us
when
then
it
is
a
question
of
an
object
meaning
signifies
its
content
or
connotation
and
practical
means
the
future
responses
which
an
object
requires
of
us
or
commits
us
but
we
may
also
start
from
a
given
idea
and
ask
what
the
means
pragmatism
will
of
course
look
to
future
consequences
but
they
will
clearly
be
of
a
different
sort
when
we
start
from
an
idea
as
idea
than
when
we
start
from
an
object
for
what
an
idea
as
idea
means
is
precisely
that
an
object
is
given
the
pragmatic
procedure
here
is
to
set
the
idea
at
work
within
the
stream
of
experience
it
appears
less
as
a
solution
than
as
a
program
for
more
work
and
particularly
as
an
indication
of
the
ways
in
which
existing
realities
may
be
changed
theories
thus
become
instruments
we
do
lie
back
on
them
we
move
forward
and
on
occasion
make
nature
over
again
by
their
aid
in
other
words
an
idea
is
a
draft
drawn
upon
existing
things
and
intention
to
act
so
as
to
arrange
them
in
a
certain
way
from
which
it
follows
that
if
the
draft
is
honored
if
existences
following
upon
the
actions
rearrange
or
readjust
themselves
in
the
way
the
idea
intends
the
idea
is
true
when
then
it
is
a
question
of
an
idea
it
is
the
idea
itself
which
is
practical
being
an
intent
and
its
resides
in
the
existences
which
as
changed
it
intends
while
the
meaning
of
an
object
is
the
changes
it
requires
in
our
attitude
the
meaning
of
an
idea
is
the
changes
it
as
our
attitude
effects
in
objects
then
we
have
another
formula
applicable
not
to
objects
nor
ideas
as
objects
and
ideas
but
to
to
things
that
is
where
the
meaning
of
the
object
and
of
the
idea
is
assumed
to
be
already
ascertained
it
reads
what
difference
would
it
practically
make
to
anyone
if
this
notion
rather
than
that
notion
were
true
if
no
practical
difference
whatever
can
be
traced
then
the
alternatives
mean
practically
the
same
thing
and
all
dispute
is
idle
there
can
be
no
difference
in
abstract
truth
that
does
express
itself
in
a
difference
in
concrete
fact
and
in
conduct
consequent
upon
the
fact
imposed
on
somebody
p
now
when
we
start
with
something
which
is
already
a
truth
or
taken
to
be
truth
and
ask
for
its
meaning
in
terms
of
its
consequences
it
is
implied
that
the
conception
or
conceptual
significance
is
already
clear
and
that
the
existences
it
refers
to
are
already
in
hand
meaning
here
then
can
be
neither
the
connotative
nor
denotative
reference
of
a
term
they
are
covered
by
the
two
prior
formulae
meaning
here
means
importance
the
practical
factor
is
then
the
worth
character
of
these
consequences
they
are
good
or
bad
desirable
or
undesirable
or
merely
indifferent
in
which
latter
case
belief
is
idle
the
controversy
a
vain
and
conventional
or
verbal
one
the
term
meaning
and
the
term
practical
taken
in
isolation
and
without
explicit
definition
from
their
specific
context
and
problem
are
triply
ambiguous
the
meaning
may
be
the
conception
or
definition
of
an
it
may
be
the
denotative
existential
reference
of
an
it
may
be
actual
value
or
so
practical
in
the
corresponding
cases
may
mean
the
attitudes
and
conduct
exacted
of
us
by
objects
or
the
capacity
and
tendency
of
an
idea
to
effect
changes
in
prior
existences
or
the
desirable
and
undesirable
quality
of
certain
ends
the
general
pragmatic
attitude
none
the
less
is
applied
in
all
cases
if
the
differing
problems
and
the
correlative
diverse
significations
of
the
terms
meaning
and
practical
are
borne
in
mind
not
all
will
be
converted
to
pragmatism
but
the
present
uncertainty
as
to
what
pragmatism
is
anyway
and
the
present
constant
complaints
on
both
sides
of
misunderstanding
will
i
think
be
minimized
at
all
events
i
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
what
the
pragmatic
movement
just
now
wants
is
a
clear
and
consistent
bearing
in
mind
of
these
different
problems
and
of
what
is
meant
by
practical
in
each
accordingly
the
rest
of
this
paper
is
an
endeavor
to
elucidate
from
the
standpoint
of
pragmatic
method
the
importance
of
enforcing
these
distinctions
ii
first
as
to
the
problems
of
philosophy
when
pragmatically
approached
james
says
the
whole
function
of
philosophy
ought
to
be
to
find
out
what
definite
difference
it
will
make
to
you
and
me
at
definite
instants
of
our
life
if
this
or
that
be
true
here
the
is
assumed
as
already
given
it
is
there
defined
and
constituted
and
the
question
is
as
to
its
import
if
believed
but
from
the
second
standpoint
that
of
idea
as
working
hypothesis
the
chief
function
of
philosophy
is
not
to
find
out
what
difference
formulae
make
but
to
arrive
at
and
to
clarify
their
as
programs
of
behavior
for
modifying
the
existent
from
this
standpoint
the
meaning
of
a
is
practical
and
moral
not
merely
in
the
consequences
which
flow
from
accepting
a
certain
conceptual
content
as
true
but
as
regards
that
content
itself
and
thus
at
the
very
outset
we
are
compelled
to
face
this
question
does
james
employ
the
pragmatic
method
to
discover
the
value
in
terms
of
consequences
in
life
of
some
formula
which
has
its
logical
content
already
fixed
or
does
he
employ
it
to
criticize
and
revise
and
ultimately
to
constitute
the
meaning
of
that
formula
if
it
is
the
first
there
is
danger
that
the
pragmatic
method
will
be
employed
only
to
vivify
if
not
validate
doctrines
which
in
themselves
are
pieces
of
rationalistic
metaphysics
not
inherently
pragmatic
if
the
last
there
is
danger
that
some
readers
will
think
old
notions
are
being
confirmed
when
in
truth
they
are
being
translated
into
new
and
inconsistent
notions
consider
the
case
of
design
james
begins
with
accepting
a
notion
to
which
he
then
applies
the
pragmatic
criterion
the
traditional
notion
is
that
of
a
seeing
force
that
runs
things
this
is
rationalistically
and
retrospectively
empty
its
being
there
makes
no
difference
this
seems
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
past
world
may
be
just
what
it
is
in
virtue
of
the
difference
which
a
blind
force
or
a
seeing
force
has
already
made
in
it
a
pragmatist
as
well
as
a
rationalist
may
reply
that
it
makes
no
difference
retrospectively
only
because
we
leave
out
the
most
important
retrospective
difference
but
returning
with
it
into
experience
we
gain
a
more
confiding
outlook
on
the
future
if
not
a
blind
force
but
a
seeing
force
runs
things
we
may
reasonably
expect
better
issues
vague
confidence
in
the
future
is
the
sole
pragmatic
meaning
at
present
discernible
in
the
terms
design
and
italics
mine
now
is
this
meaning
intended
to
the
meaning
of
a
seeing
force
which
runs
things
or
is
it
intended
to
superadd
a
pragmatic
value
and
validation
to
that
concept
of
a
seeing
force
or
does
it
mean
that
irrespective
of
the
existence
of
any
such
object
a
belief
in
it
has
that
value
strict
pragmatism
would
seem
to
require
the
first
interpretation
the
same
difficulties
arise
in
the
discussion
of
spiritualistic
theism
materialism
compare
the
two
following
statements
the
notion
of
god
guarantees
an
ideal
order
that
shall
be
permanently
preserved
here
then
in
these
different
emotional
and
practical
appeals
in
these
adjustments
of
our
attitudes
of
hope
and
expectation
and
all
the
delicate
consequences
which
their
differences
entail
the
real
meanings
of
materialism
and
italics
mine
does
the
latter
method
of
determining
the
meaning
of
say
a
spiritual
god
afford
the
substitute
for
the
conception
of
him
as
a
superhuman
power
effecting
the
eternal
preservation
of
something
does
it
that
is
define
god
supply
the
content
for
our
notion
of
god
or
does
it
merely
superadd
a
value
to
a
meaning
already
fixed
and
if
the
latter
does
the
object
god
as
defined
or
the
notion
or
the
belief
the
acceptance
of
the
notion
effect
these
consequent
values
in
either
of
the
latter
alternatives
the
good
or
valuable
consequences
can
not
clarify
the
meaning
or
conception
of
god
for
by
the
argument
they
proceed
from
a
prior
definition
of
god
they
can
not
prove
or
render
more
probable
the
existence
of
such
a
being
for
by
the
argument
these
desirable
consequences
depend
upon
accepting
such
an
existence
and
not
even
pragmatism
can
prove
an
existence
from
desirable
consequences
which
themselves
exist
only
when
and
if
that
other
existence
is
there
on
the
other
hand
if
the
pragmatic
method
is
not
applied
simply
to
tell
the
value
of
a
belief
or
controversy
but
to
fix
the
meaning
of
the
terms
involved
in
the
belief
resulting
consequences
would
serve
to
constitute
the
entire
meaning
intellectual
as
well
as
practical
of
the
terms
and
hence
the
pragmatic
method
would
simply
abolish
the
meaning
of
an
antecedent
power
which
will
perpetuate
eternally
some
existence
for
that
consequence
flows
not
from
the
belief
or
idea
but
from
the
existence
the
power
it
is
not
pragmatic
at
all
accordingly
when
james
says
other
than
this
significance
the
words
god
free
will
design
yet
dark
though
they
be
in
themselves
or
intellectualistically
taken
when
we
bear
them
on
to
life
thicket
with
us
the
darkness
then
grows
light
about
us
italics
mine
what
is
meant
is
it
meant
that
when
we
take
the
intellectualistic
notion
and
employ
it
it
gets
value
in
the
way
of
results
and
hence
then
has
some
value
of
its
own
or
is
it
meant
that
the
intellectual
content
itself
must
be
determined
in
terms
of
the
changes
effected
in
the
ordering
of
life
thicket
an
explicit
declaration
on
this
point
would
settle
i
think
not
merely
a
point
interesting
in
itself
but
one
essential
to
the
determination
of
what
is
pragmatic
method
for
myself
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
seems
unpragmatic
for
pragmatism
to
content
itself
with
finding
out
the
value
of
a
conception
whose
own
inherent
significance
pragmatism
has
not
first
determined
a
fact
which
entails
that
it
be
taken
not
as
a
truth
but
simply
as
a
working
hypothesis
in
the
particular
case
in
question
moreover
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
pragmatic
method
could
possibly
be
applied
to
a
notion
of
eternal
perpetuation
which
by
its
nature
can
never
be
empirically
verified
or
cashed
in
any
particular
case
this
brings
us
to
the
question
of
truth
the
problem
here
is
also
ambiguous
in
advance
of
definition
does
the
problem
of
what
is
truth
refer
to
discovering
the
true
meaning
of
something
or
to
discovering
what
an
idea
has
to
effect
and
how
in
order
to
be
true
or
to
discovering
what
the
value
of
truth
is
when
it
is
an
existent
and
accomplished
fact
we
may
of
course
find
the
true
meaning
of
a
thing
as
distinct
from
its
incorrect
interpretation
without
thereby
establishing
the
truth
of
the
true
meaning
as
we
may
dispute
about
the
true
meaning
of
a
passage
in
the
classics
concerning
centaurs
without
the
determination
of
its
true
sense
establishing
the
truth
of
the
notion
that
there
are
centaurs
occasionally
this
true
meaning
seems
to
be
what
james
has
in
mind
as
when
after
the
passage
upon
design
already
quoted
he
goes
on
but
if
cosmic
confidence
is
right
not
wrong
better
not
worse
that
vague
confidence
in
the
future
is
a
most
important
meaning
that
much
at
least
of
possible
the
terms
will
then
have
in
them
truth
here
seems
to
mean
that
design
has
a
genuine
not
merely
conventional
or
verbal
meaning
that
something
is
at
stake
and
there
are
frequently
points
where
truth
seems
to
mean
just
meaning
that
is
genuine
as
distinct
from
empty
or
verbal
but
the
problem
of
the
meaning
of
truth
may
also
refer
to
the
meaning
or
value
of
truths
that
already
exist
as
truths
we
have
them
they
exist
now
what
do
they
mean
the
answer
is
true
ideas
lead
us
into
useful
verbal
and
conceptual
quarters
as
well
as
directly
up
to
useful
sensible
termini
they
lead
to
consistency
stability
and
flowing
human
intercourse
this
referring
to
things
already
true
i
do
not
suppose
the
most
rationalist
would
question
and
even
if
he
questions
the
pragmatic
contention
that
these
consequences
define
the
meaning
of
truth
he
should
see
that
here
is
not
given
an
account
of
what
it
means
for
an
idea
to
but
only
of
what
it
means
it
has
become
true
truth
as
it
is
the
meaning
of
truth
as
which
is
here
defined
bearing
this
in
mind
i
do
not
know
why
a
rationalist
should
object
to
the
doctrine
that
truth
is
valuable
not
but
because
when
given
it
leads
to
desirable
consequences
the
true
thought
is
useful
here
because
the
home
which
is
its
object
is
useful
the
practical
value
of
true
ideas
is
thus
primarily
derived
from
the
practical
importance
of
their
objects
to
us
and
many
besides
confirmed
pragmatists
any
utilitarian
for
example
would
be
willing
to
say
that
our
duty
to
pursue
truth
is
conditioned
upon
its
leading
to
objects
which
upon
the
whole
are
valuable
the
concrete
benefits
we
gain
are
what
we
mean
by
calling
the
pursuit
a
duty
compare
difficulties
have
arisen
chiefly
because
james
is
charged
with
converting
simply
the
foregoing
proposition
and
arguing
that
since
true
ideas
are
good
any
idea
if
good
in
any
way
is
true
certainly
transition
from
one
of
these
conceptions
to
the
other
is
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
ideas
are
tested
as
to
their
validity
by
a
certain
goodness
whether
they
are
good
for
accomplishing
what
they
intend
for
what
they
claim
to
be
good
for
that
is
certain
modifications
in
prior
given
existences
in
this
case
it
is
the
idea
which
is
practical
since
it
is
essentially
an
intent
and
plan
of
altering
prior
existences
in
a
specific
situation
which
is
indicated
to
be
unsatisfactory
by
the
very
fact
that
it
needs
or
suggests
a
specific
modification
then
arises
the
theory
that
ideas
as
ideas
are
always
working
hypotheses
concerning
the
attaining
of
particular
empirical
results
and
are
tentative
programs
or
sketches
of
method
for
attaining
them
if
we
stick
consistently
to
this
notion
of
ideas
only
which
are
actually
produced
by
the
working
of
the
idea
in
with
or
application
to
prior
existences
are
good
consequences
in
the
specific
sense
of
good
which
is
relevant
to
establishing
the
truth
of
an
this
is
at
times
unequivocally
recognized
by
james
see
for
example
the
reference
to
on
the
acceptance
of
the
idea
that
verification
means
the
advent
of
the
object
intended
on
p
but
at
other
times
any
good
which
flows
from
acceptance
of
a
belief
is
treated
as
if
it
were
an
evidence
so
of
the
truth
of
the
idea
this
holds
particularly
when
theological
notions
are
under
consideration
light
would
be
thrown
upon
how
james
conceives
this
matter
by
statements
on
such
points
as
these
if
ideas
terminate
in
good
consequences
but
yet
the
goodness
of
the
consequences
was
no
part
of
the
intention
of
an
idea
does
the
goodness
have
any
verifying
force
if
the
goodness
of
consequences
arises
from
the
context
of
the
idea
in
belief
rather
than
from
the
idea
itself
does
it
have
any
verifying
force
if
an
idea
leads
to
consequences
which
are
good
in
the
respect
only
of
fulfilling
the
intent
of
the
idea
as
when
one
drinks
a
liquid
to
test
the
idea
that
it
is
a
poison
does
the
badness
of
the
consequences
in
every
other
respect
detract
from
the
verifying
force
of
consequences
since
james
has
referred
to
me
as
saying
truth
is
what
gives
satisfaction
i
may
remark
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
do
not
think
i
ever
said
that
truth
is
what
satisfaction
that
i
have
never
identified
any
satisfaction
with
the
truth
of
an
idea
save
satisfaction
which
arises
when
the
idea
as
working
hypothesis
or
tentative
method
is
applied
to
prior
existences
in
such
a
way
as
to
fulfil
what
it
intends
my
final
impression
which
i
can
not
adequately
prove
is
that
upon
the
whole
james
is
most
concerned
to
enforce
as
against
rationalism
two
conclusions
about
the
character
of
truths
as
namely
that
they
are
made
not
a
priori
or
eternally
in
existence
and
that
their
value
or
importance
is
not
static
but
dynamic
and
practical
the
special
question
of
truths
are
made
is
not
particularly
relevant
to
this
crusade
while
it
is
the
chief
question
of
interest
to
many
because
of
this
conflict
of
problems
what
james
says
about
the
value
of
truth
when
accomplished
is
likely
to
be
interpreted
by
some
as
a
criterion
of
the
truth
of
ideas
while
on
the
other
hand
james
himself
is
likely
to
pass
lightly
from
the
consequences
that
determine
the
worth
of
a
belief
to
those
which
decide
the
worth
of
an
idea
when
james
says
the
function
of
giving
satisfaction
in
marrying
previous
parts
of
experience
with
newer
parts
is
necessary
in
order
to
establish
truth
the
doctrine
is
unambiguous
the
satisfactory
character
of
consequences
is
itself
measured
and
defined
by
the
conditions
which
led
up
to
it
the
inherently
satisfactory
quality
of
results
is
not
taken
as
validating
the
antecedent
intellectual
operations
but
when
he
says
not
of
his
own
position
but
of
an
opponent
of
the
idea
of
an
absolute
so
far
as
it
affords
such
comfort
it
surely
is
not
sterile
it
has
that
amount
of
value
it
performs
a
concrete
function
as
a
good
pragmatist
i
myself
ought
to
call
the
absolute
true
so
far
then
and
i
unhesitatingly
now
do
so
the
doctrine
seems
to
be
as
unambiguous
in
the
other
direction
that
any
good
consequent
upon
acceptance
of
a
belief
is
in
so
far
forth
a
warrant
of
truth
in
such
passages
as
the
following
which
are
of
the
common
type
the
two
notions
seem
blended
together
ideas
become
true
just
in
so
far
as
they
help
us
to
get
into
satisfactory
relations
with
other
parts
of
our
experience
and
again
on
the
same
page
any
idea
that
will
carry
us
from
any
one
part
of
our
experience
to
any
other
part
linking
things
working
securely
simplifying
saving
labor
is
true
for
just
so
much
italics
mine
an
explicit
statement
as
to
whether
the
carrying
function
the
linking
of
things
is
satisfactory
and
prosperous
and
hence
true
in
so
far
as
it
executes
the
intent
of
an
idea
or
whether
the
satisfaction
and
prosperity
reside
in
the
material
consequences
on
their
own
account
and
in
that
aspect
make
the
idea
true
would
i
am
sure
locate
the
point
at
issue
and
economize
and
fructify
future
discussion
at
present
pragmatism
is
accepted
by
those
whose
own
notions
are
thoroughly
rationalistic
in
as
a
means
of
refurbishing
galvanizing
and
justifying
those
very
notions
it
is
rejected
by
empiricists
and
naturalistic
idealists
because
it
seems
to
them
identified
with
the
notion
that
pragmatism
holds
that
the
desirability
of
certain
beliefs
overrides
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
ideas
involved
in
them
and
the
existence
of
objects
denoted
by
them
others
like
myself
who
believe
thoroughly
in
pragmatism
as
a
method
of
orientation
as
defined
by
james
and
who
would
apply
the
method
to
the
determination
of
the
meaning
of
objects
the
intent
and
worth
of
ideas
as
ideas
and
to
the
human
and
moral
value
of
beliefs
when
these
various
problems
are
carefully
distinguished
from
one
another
do
not
know
whether
they
are
pragmatists
in
some
other
sense
because
they
are
not
sure
whether
the
practical
in
the
sense
of
desirable
facts
which
define
the
worth
of
a
belief
is
confused
with
the
practical
as
an
attitude
imposed
by
objects
and
with
the
practical
as
a
power
and
function
of
ideas
to
effect
changes
in
prior
existences
hence
the
importance
of
knowing
which
one
of
the
three
senses
of
practical
is
conveyed
in
any
given
passage
it
would
do
james
an
injustice
however
to
stop
here
his
real
doctrine
is
that
a
belief
is
true
when
it
satisfies
both
personal
needs
and
the
requirements
of
objective
things
speaking
of
pragmatism
he
says
her
only
test
of
probable
truth
is
what
works
best
in
the
way
of
what
fits
every
part
of
life
best
and
with
the
collectivity
of
experience
nothing
being
omitted
italics
mine
and
again
that
new
idea
is
truest
which
performs
most
felicitously
its
function
of
satisfying
double
it
does
not
appear
certain
from
the
context
that
this
double
urgency
is
that
of
the
personal
and
the
objective
demands
respectively
but
it
is
probable
see
also
where
consistency
with
previous
truth
and
novel
fact
is
said
to
be
always
the
most
imperious
claimant
on
this
basis
the
in
so
far
forth
of
the
truth
of
the
absolute
because
of
the
comfort
it
supplies
means
that
one
of
the
two
conditions
which
need
to
be
satisfied
has
been
met
so
that
if
the
idea
of
the
absolute
met
the
other
one
also
it
would
be
quite
true
i
have
no
doubt
this
is
james
meaning
and
it
sufficiently
safeguards
him
from
the
charge
that
pragmatism
means
that
anything
which
is
agreeable
is
true
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
think
in
logical
strictness
that
satisfying
one
of
two
tests
when
satisfaction
of
both
is
required
can
be
said
to
constitute
a
belief
true
even
in
so
far
forth
iii
at
all
events
this
raises
a
question
not
touched
so
far
the
place
of
the
personal
in
the
determination
of
truth
james
for
example
emphasizes
the
doctrine
suggested
in
the
following
words
we
say
this
theory
solves
it
the
problem
more
satisfactorily
than
that
theory
but
that
means
more
satisfactorily
and
individuals
will
emphasize
their
points
of
satisfaction
differently
italics
mine
this
opens
out
into
a
question
which
in
its
larger
aspects
the
place
of
the
personal
factor
in
the
constitution
of
knowledge
systems
and
of
reality
i
can
not
here
enter
upon
save
to
say
that
a
synthetic
pragmatism
such
as
james
has
ventured
upon
will
take
a
very
different
form
according
as
the
point
of
view
of
what
he
calls
the
chicago
school
or
that
of
humanism
is
taken
as
a
basis
for
interpreting
the
nature
of
the
personal
according
to
the
latter
view
the
personal
appears
to
be
ultimate
and
unanalyzable
the
metaphysically
real
associations
with
idealism
moreover
give
it
an
idealistic
turn
a
translation
in
effect
of
monistic
intellectualistic
idealism
into
pluralistic
voluntaristic
idealism
but
according
to
the
former
the
personal
is
not
ultimate
but
is
to
be
analyzed
and
defined
biologically
on
its
genetic
side
ethically
on
its
prospective
and
functioning
side
there
is
however
one
phase
of
the
teaching
illustrated
by
the
quotation
which
is
directly
relevant
here
because
james
recognizes
that
the
personal
element
enters
into
judgments
passed
upon
whether
a
problem
has
or
has
not
been
satisfactorily
solved
he
is
charged
with
extreme
subjectivism
with
encouraging
the
element
of
personal
preference
to
run
over
all
objective
controls
now
the
question
raised
in
the
quotation
is
primarily
one
of
fact
not
of
doctrine
is
or
is
not
a
personal
factor
found
in
truth
evaluations
if
it
is
pragmatism
is
not
responsible
for
introducing
it
if
it
is
not
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
refute
pragmatism
by
appeal
to
empirical
fact
rather
than
by
reviling
it
for
subjectivism
now
it
is
an
old
story
that
philosophers
in
common
with
theologians
and
social
theorists
are
as
sure
that
personal
habits
and
interests
shape
their
opponents
doctrines
as
they
are
that
their
own
beliefs
are
absolutely
universal
and
objective
in
quality
hence
arises
that
dishonesty
that
insincerity
characteristic
of
philosophic
discussion
as
james
says
the
most
potential
of
all
our
premises
is
never
mentioned
now
the
moment
the
complicity
of
the
personal
factor
in
our
philosophic
valuations
is
recognized
is
recognized
fully
frankly
and
generally
that
moment
a
new
era
in
philosophy
will
begin
we
shall
have
to
discover
the
personal
factors
that
now
influence
us
unconsciously
and
begin
to
accept
a
new
and
moral
responsibility
for
them
a
responsibility
for
judging
and
testing
them
by
their
consequences
so
long
as
we
ignore
this
factor
its
deeds
will
be
largely
evil
not
because
is
evil
but
because
flourishing
in
the
dark
it
is
without
responsibility
and
without
check
the
only
way
to
control
it
is
by
recognizing
it
and
while
i
would
not
prophesy
of
pragmatism
future
i
would
say
that
this
element
which
is
now
so
generally
condemned
as
intellectual
dishonesty
perhaps
because
of
an
uneasy
instinctive
recognition
of
the
searching
of
hearts
its
acceptance
would
involve
will
in
the
future
be
accounted
unto
philosophy
for
righteousness
sake
so
much
in
general
in
particular
cases
it
is
possible
that
james
language
occasionally
leaves
the
impression
that
the
fact
of
the
inevitable
involution
of
the
personal
factor
in
every
belief
gives
some
special
sanction
to
some
special
belief
james
says
that
his
essay
on
the
to
believe
was
unluckily
entitled
the
to
believe
well
even
the
term
right
is
unfortunate
if
the
personal
or
belief
factor
is
inevitable
unfortunate
because
it
seems
to
indicate
a
privilege
which
might
be
exercised
in
special
cases
in
religion
for
example
though
not
in
science
or
because
it
suggests
to
some
minds
that
the
fact
of
the
personal
complicity
involved
in
belief
is
a
warrant
for
this
or
that
special
personal
attitude
instead
of
being
a
warning
to
locate
and
define
it
so
as
to
accept
responsibility
for
it
if
we
mean
by
will
not
something
deliberate
and
consciously
intentional
much
less
something
insincere
but
an
active
personal
participation
then
belief
will
rather
than
either
the
right
or
the
will
to
believe
seems
to
phrase
the
matter
correctly
i
have
attempted
to
review
not
so
much
james
book
as
the
present
status
of
the
pragmatic
movement
which
is
expressed
in
the
book
and
i
have
selected
only
those
points
which
seem
to
bear
directly
upon
matters
of
contemporary
controversy
even
as
an
account
of
this
limited
field
the
foregoing
pages
do
an
injustice
to
james
save
as
it
is
recognized
that
his
lectures
were
popular
lectures
as
the
advises
us
we
can
not
expect
in
such
lectures
the
kind
of
explicitness
which
would
satisfy
the
professional
and
technical
interests
that
have
inspired
this
review
moreover
it
is
inevitable
that
the
attempt
to
compose
different
points
of
view
hitherto
into
a
single
whole
should
give
rise
to
problems
foreign
to
any
one
factor
of
the
synthesis
left
to
itself
the
need
and
possibility
of
the
discrimination
of
various
elements
in
the
pragmatic
meaning
of
practical
attempted
in
this
review
would
hardly
have
been
recognized
by
me
were
it
not
for
of
perplexity
and
confusion
which
james
combination
has
effected
james
has
given
so
many
evidences
of
the
sincerity
of
his
intellectual
aims
that
i
trust
to
his
pardon
for
the
injustice
which
the
character
of
my
review
may
have
done
in
view
of
whatever
service
it
may
render
in
clarifying
the
problem
to
which
he
is
devoted
as
for
the
book
itself
it
is
in
any
case
beyond
a
critic
praise
or
blame
it
is
more
likely
to
take
place
as
a
philosophical
classic
than
any
other
writing
of
our
day
a
critic
who
should
attempt
to
appraise
it
would
probably
give
one
more
illustration
of
the
sterility
of
criticism
compared
with
the
productiveness
of
creative
genius
even
those
who
dislike
pragmatism
can
hardly
fail
to
find
much
of
profit
in
the
exhibition
of
james
instinct
for
concrete
facts
the
breadth
of
his
sympathies
and
his
illuminating
insights
unreserved
frankness
lucid
imagination
varied
contacts
with
life
digested
into
summary
and
trenchant
conclusions
keen
perceptions
of
human
nature
in
the
concrete
a
constant
sense
of
the
subordination
of
philosophy
to
life
capacity
to
put
things
into
an
english
which
projects
ideas
as
if
bodily
into
space
till
they
are
solid
things
to
walk
around
and
survey
from
different
sides
these
things
are
not
so
common
in
philosophy
that
they
may
not
smell
sweet
even
by
the
name
of
pragmatism

certain
aspects

us
later
vol

only
those
who
have
already
lost
in
the
idealistic
confusion
of
existence
and
meaning
will
take
this
to
mean
that
the
object
is
those
changes
in
our
reactions
i
assume
that
the
reader
is
sufficiently
familiar
with
james
book
not
to
be
misled
by
the
text
into
thinking
that
james
himself
discriminates
as
i
have
done
these
three
types
of
problems
from
one
another
he
does
not
but
none
the
less
the
three
formulae
for
the
three
situations
are
there
the
idea
of
immortality
or
the
traditional
theistic
idea
of
god
for
example
may
produce
its
good
consequences
not
in
virtue
of
the
idea
as
idea
but
from
the
character
of
the
person
who
entertains
the
belief
or
it
may
be
the
idea
of
the
supreme
value
of
ideal
considerations
rather
than
that
of
their
temporal
duration
which
works
eternal
truth
is
one
of
the
most
ambiguous
phrases
that
philosophers
trip
over
it
may
mean
eternally
in
existence
or
that
a
statement
which
is
ever
true
is
always
true
if
it
is
true
a
fly
is
buzzing
it
is
eternally
true
that
just
now
a
fly
buzzed
or
it
may
mean
that
some
truths
so
far
as
wholly
are
irrelevant
to
any
particular
time
determination
since
they
are
in
import
the
truth
of
geometry
dialectically
taken
that
is
without
asking
whether
any
particular
existence
exemplifies
them
such
statements
it
ought
in
fairness
to
be
said
generally
come
when
james
is
speaking
of
a
doctrine
which
he
does
not
himself
believe
and
arise
i
think
in
that
fairness
and
frankness
of
james
so
unusual
in
philosophers
which
cause
him
to
lean
over
backward
unpragmatically
it
seems
to
me
as
to
the
claim
of
his
own
doctrine
he
consistently
sticks
to
his
statement
pent
in
as
the
pragmatist
more
than
any
one
sees
himself
to
be
between
the
whole
body
of
funded
truths
squeezed
from
the
past
and
the
coercions
of
the
world
of
sense
about
him
who
so
well
as
he
feels
the
immense
pressure
of
objective
control
under
which
our
minds
perform
their
operations
if
anyone
imagines
that
this
law
is
lax
let
him
keep
its
commandments
one
day
says
emerson
of
course
james
holds
that
this
in
so
far
goes
a
very
small
way
see
pp
but
even
the
slightest
concession
is
i
think
unless
the
satisfaction
is
relevant
to
the
idea
as
intent
now
the
satisfaction
in
question
comes
not
from
the
idea
as
but
from
its
acceptance
as
can
a
satisfaction
dependent
on
an
assumption
that
an
idea
is
already
true
be
relevant
to
testing
the
truth
of
an
idea
and
can
an
idea
like
that
of
the
absolute
which
if
true
absolutely
precludes
any
appeal
to
consequences
as
test
of
truth
be
confirmed
by
use
of
the
pragmatic
test
without
sheer
in
other
words
we
have
a
confusion
of
the
test
of
an
idea
as
idea
with
that
of
the
value
of
a
belief
as
belief
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
possible
that
all
james
intends
by
truth
here
is
true
genuine
meaning
at
stake
in
the
issue
true
not
as
distinct
from
false
but
from
meaningless
or
verbal
xiii
an
added
note
as
to
the
practical
it
is
easier
to
start
a
legend
than
to
prevent
its
continued
circulation
no
misconception
of
the
instrumental
logic
has
been
more
persistent
than
the
belief
that
it
makes
knowledge
merely
a
means
to
a
practical
end
or
to
the
satisfaction
of
practical
needs
practical
being
taking
to
signify
some
quite
definite
utilities
of
a
material
or
type
habitual
associations
aroused
by
the
word
pragmatic
have
been
stronger
than
the
most
explicit
and
emphatic
statements
which
any
pragmatist
has
been
able
to
make
but
i
again
affirm
that
the
term
pragmatic
means
only
the
rule
of
referring
all
thinking
all
reflective
considerations
to
for
final
meaning
and
test
nothing
is
said
about
the
nature
of
the
consequences
they
may
be
aesthetic
or
moral
or
political
or
religious
in
quality
anything
you
please
all
that
the
theory
requires
is
that
they
be
in
some
way
consequences
of
thinking
not
indeed
of
it
alone
but
of
it
acted
upon
in
connection
with
other
things
this
is
no
inserted
to
lessen
the
force
of
objections
peirce
explained
that
he
took
the
term
pragmatic
from
kant
in
order
to
denote
empirical
consequences
when
he
refers
to
their
practical
character
it
is
only
to
indicate
a
criterion
by
which
to
avoid
purely
verbal
disputes
different
consequences
are
alleged
to
constitute
rival
meanings
of
a
term
is
a
difference
more
than
merely
one
of
formulation
the
way
to
get
an
answer
is
to
ask
whether
if
realized
these
consequences
would
exact
of
us
different
modes
of
behavior
if
they
do
not
make
such
a
difference
in
conduct
the
difference
between
them
is
conventional
it
is
not
that
consequences
are
themselves
practical
but
that
practical
consequences
from
them
may
at
times
be
appealed
to
in
order
to
decide
the
specific
question
of
whether
two
proposed
meanings
differ
save
in
words
james
says
expressly
that
what
is
important
is
that
the
consequences
should
be
specific
not
that
they
should
be
active
when
he
said
that
general
notions
must
cash
in
he
meant
of
course
that
they
must
be
translatable
into
verifiable
specific
things
but
the
words
cash
in
were
enough
for
some
of
his
critics
who
pride
themselves
upon
a
logical
rigor
unattainable
by
mere
pragmatists
in
the
logical
version
of
pragmatism
termed
instrumentalism
action
or
practice
does
indeed
play
a
fundamental
r√¥le
but
it
concerns
not
the
nature
of
consequences
but
the
nature
of
knowing
to
use
a
term
which
is
now
more
fashionable
and
surely
to
some
extent
in
consequence
of
pragmatism
than
it
was
earlier
instrumentalism
means
a
behaviorist
theory
of
thinking
and
knowing
it
means
that
knowing
is
literally
something
which
we
do
that
analysis
is
ultimately
physical
and
active
that
meanings
in
their
logical
quality
are
standpoints
attitudes
and
methods
of
behaving
toward
facts
and
that
active
experimentation
is
essential
to
verification
put
in
another
way
it
holds
that
thinking
does
not
mean
any
transcendent
states
or
acts
suddenly
introduced
into
a
previously
natural
scene
but
that
the
operations
of
knowing
are
or
are
artfully
derived
from
natural
responses
of
the
organism
which
constitute
knowing
in
virtue
of
the
situation
of
doubt
in
which
they
arise
and
in
virtue
of
the
uses
of
inquiry
reconstruction
and
control
to
which
they
are
put
there
is
no
warrant
in
the
doctrine
for
carrying
over
practical
quality
into
the
consequences
in
which
action
culminates
and
by
which
it
is
tested
and
corrected
a
knowing
as
an
act
is
instrumental
to
the
resultant
controlled
and
more
significant
situation
this
does
not
imply
anything
about
the
intrinsic
or
the
instrumental
character
of
the
consequent
situation
that
is
whatever
it
may
be
in
a
given
case
there
is
nothing
novel
nor
heterodox
in
the
notion
that
thinking
is
instrumental
the
very
word
is
redolent
of
an
whether
or
the
term
instrumentality
applied
to
thinking
raises
at
once
however
the
question
of
whether
thinking
as
a
tool
falls
within
or
without
the
which
it
shapes
into
knowledge
the
answer
of
formal
logic
adopted
moreover
by
kant
and
followed
in
some
way
by
all
logics
is
unambiguous
to
call
logic
formal
means
precisely
that
mind
or
thought
supplies
forms
foreign
to
the
original
but
yet
required
in
order
that
it
should
have
the
appropriate
form
of
knowledge
in
this
regard
it
deviates
from
the
aristotelian
which
it
professes
to
follow
for
according
to
aristotle
the
processes
of
knowing
of
teaching
and
learning
which
lead
up
to
knowledge
are
but
the
actualization
through
the
potentialities
of
the
human
body
of
the
forms
or
natures
which
are
previously
actualized
in
nature
through
the
potentialities
of
bodies
thinking
which
is
not
instrumental
to
truth
which
is
merely
formal
in
the
modern
sense
would
have
been
a
monstrosity
inconceivable
to
him
but
the
discarding
of
the
metaphysics
of
form
and
matter
of
cyclic
actualizations
and
eternal
species
deprived
the
aristotelian
thought
of
any
place
within
the
scheme
of
things
and
left
it
an
activity
with
forms
alien
to
to
conceive
of
thinking
as
instrumental
to
truth
or
knowledge
and
as
a
tool
shaped
out
of
the
same
as
that
to
which
it
is
applied
is
but
to
return
to
the
aristotelian
tradition
about
logic
that
the
practice
of
science
has
in
the
meantime
substituted
a
logic
of
experimental
discovery
of
which
definition
and
classification
are
themselves
but
auxiliary
tools
for
a
logic
of
arrangement
and
exposition
of
what
is
already
known
necessitates
however
a
very
different
sort
of
it
makes
necessary
the
conception
that
the
object
of
knowledge
is
not
something
with
which
thinking
sets
out
but
something
with
which
it
ends
something
which
the
processes
of
inquiry
and
testing
that
constitute
thinking
themselves
produce
thus
the
object
of
knowledge
is
practical
in
the
sense
that
it
depends
upon
a
specific
kind
of
practice
for
its
existence
for
its
existence
as
an
object
of
knowledge
how
practical
it
may
be
in
any
other
sense
than
this
is
quite
another
story
the
of
marks
an
achieved
triumph
a
secured
control
that
holds
by
the
very
nature
of
knowledge
what
other
uses
it
may
have
depends
upon
its
own
inherent
character
not
upon
anything
in
the
nature
of
knowledge
we
do
not
know
the
origin
and
nature
and
the
cure
of
malaria
till
we
can
both
produce
and
eliminate
malaria
the
of
either
the
production
or
the
removal
depends
upon
the
character
of
malaria
in
relation
to
other
things
and
so
it
is
with
mathematical
knowledge
or
with
knowledge
of
politics
or
art
their
respective
objects
are
not
known
till
they
are
made
in
course
of
the
process
of
experimental
thinking
their
usefulness
when
made
is
whatever
from
infinity
to
zero
experience
may
subsequently
determine
it
to
be
xiv
the
logic
of
judgments
of
practice
their
nature
in
introducing
the
discussion
i
shall
first
say
a
word
to
avoid
possible
misunderstandings
it
may
be
objected
that
such
a
term
as
practical
judgment
is
misleading
that
the
term
practical
judgment
is
a
misnomer
and
a
dangerous
one
since
all
judgments
by
their
very
nature
are
intellectual
or
theoretical
consequently
there
is
a
danger
that
the
term
will
lead
us
to
treat
as
judgment
and
knowledge
something
which
is
not
really
knowledge
at
all
and
thus
start
us
on
the
road
which
ends
in
mysticism
or
obscurantism
all
this
is
admitted
i
do
not
mean
by
practical
judgment
a
type
of
judgment
having
a
different
organ
and
source
from
other
judgments
i
mean
simply
a
kind
of
judgment
having
a
specific
type
of
propositions
exist
relating
to
to
things
to
do
or
be
done
judgments
of
a
situation
demanding
action
there
are
for
example
propositions
of
the
form
should
do
thus
and
so
it
is
better
wiser
more
prudent
right
advisable
opportune
expedient
to
act
thus
and
so
and
this
is
the
type
of
judgment
i
denote
practical
it
may
also
be
objected
that
this
type
of
is
not
distinctive
that
there
is
no
ground
for
marking
it
off
from
judgments
of
the
form
or
i
am
willing
again
to
admit
that
such
may
turn
out
to
be
the
fact
but
meanwhile
the
prima
facie
difference
is
worth
considering
if
only
for
the
sake
of
reaching
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
no
there
is
a
kind
of
so
distinctive
as
to
imply
a
distinctive
logical
form
to
assume
in
advance
that
the
of
practical
judgments
be
reducible
to
the
form
or
is
assuredly
as
gratuitous
as
the
contrary
assumption
it
begs
one
of
the
most
important
questions
about
the
world
which
can
be
asked
the
nature
of
time
moreover
current
discussion
exhibits
if
not
a
complete
void
at
least
a
decided
lacuna
as
to
propositions
of
this
type
russell
has
recently
said
that
of
the
two
parts
of
logic
the
first
enumerates
or
inventories
the
different
kinds
or
forms
of
propositions
it
is
noticeable
that
he
does
not
even
mention
this
kind
as
a
possible
kind
yet
it
is
conceivable
that
this
omission
seriously
compromises
the
discussion
of
other
kinds
additional
specimens
of
practical
judgments
may
be
given
he
had
better
consult
a
physician
it
would
not
be
advisable
for
you
to
invest
in
those
bonds
the
united
states
should
either
modify
its
monroe
doctrine
or
else
make
more
efficient
military
preparations
this
is
a
good
time
to
build
a
house
if
i
do
that
i
shall
be
doing
wrong
etc
it
is
silly
to
dwell
upon
the
practical
importance
of
judgments
of
this
sort
but
not
wholly
silly
to
say
that
their
practical
importance
arouses
suspicion
as
to
the
grounds
of
their
neglect
in
discussion
of
logical
forms
in
general
regarding
them
we
may
say
their
implies
an
incomplete
situation
this
incompleteness
is
not
psychical
something
is
there
but
what
is
there
does
not
constitute
the
entire
objective
situation
there
it
requires
something
else
only
after
this
something
else
has
been
supplied
will
the
given
coincide
with
the
full
this
consideration
has
an
important
bearing
upon
the
conception
of
the
indeterminate
and
contingent
it
is
sometimes
assumed
both
by
adherents
and
by
opponents
that
the
validity
of
these
notions
entails
that
the
is
itself
indeterminate
which
appears
to
be
nonsense
the
logical
implication
is
that
of
a
as
yet
unfinished
or
not
wholly
given
the
implication
is
of
future
things
moreover
the
incompleteness
is
not
personal
i
mean
by
this
that
the
situation
is
not
confined
the
one
making
the
judgment
the
practical
judgment
is
neither
exclusively
nor
primarily
about
one
self
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
judgment
about
one
self
only
as
it
is
a
judgment
about
the
situation
in
which
one
is
included
and
in
which
a
multitude
of
other
factors
external
to
self
are
included
the
contrary
assumption
is
so
constantly
made
about
moral
judgments
that
this
statement
must
appear
dogmatic
but
surely
the
prima
facie
case
is
that
when
i
judge
that
i
should
not
give
money
to
the
street
beggar
i
am
judging
the
nature
of
an
objective
situation
and
that
the
conclusion
about
myself
is
governed
by
the
proposition
about
the
situation
in
which
i
happen
to
be
included
the
full
complex
proposition
includes
the
beggar
social
conditions
and
consequences
a
charity
organization
society
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
it
contains
myself
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
seems
impossible
to
defend
the
objectivity
of
moral
propositions
on
any
other
ground
we
may
at
least
point
to
the
fact
that
judgments
of
policy
whether
made
about
ourselves
or
some
other
agent
are
certainly
judgments
of
a
which
is
temporarily
unfinished
now
is
a
good
time
for
me
to
buy
certain
railway
bonds
is
a
judgment
about
myself
only
because
it
is
primarily
a
judgment
about
hundreds
of
factors
wholly
external
to
myself
if
the
genuine
existence
of
such
propositions
be
admitted
the
only
question
about
moral
judgments
is
whether
or
no
they
are
cases
of
practical
judgments
as
the
latter
have
been
defined
a
question
of
utmost
importance
for
moral
theory
but
not
of
crucial
import
for
our
logical
discussion
their
implies
that
the
proposition
is
itself
a
factor
in
the
completion
of
the
situation
carrying
it
forward
to
its
conclusion
according
as
the
judgment
is
that
this
or
that
should
be
done
the
situation
will
when
completed
have
this
or
that
the
proposition
that
it
is
well
to
do
this
is
a
proposition
to
treat
the
given
in
a
certain
way
since
the
way
is
established
by
the
proposition
the
proposition
is
determining
factor
in
the
outcome
as
a
proposition
about
the
supplementation
of
the
given
it
is
a
factor
the
supplementation
and
this
not
as
an
extraneous
matter
something
subsequent
to
the
proposition
but
in
its
own
logical
force
here
is
found
prima
facie
at
least
a
marked
distinction
of
the
practical
proposition
from
descriptive
and
narrative
propositions
from
the
familiar
propositions
and
from
those
of
pure
mathematics
the
latter
imply
that
the
proposition
does
not
enter
into
the
constitution
of
the
of
the
proposition
there
also
is
a
distinction
from
another
kind
of
contingent
proposition
namely
that
which
has
the
form
he
has
started
for
your
house
the
house
is
still
burning
it
will
probably
rain
the
unfinishedness
of
the
given
is
implied
in
these
propositions
but
it
is
not
implied
that
the
proposition
is
a
factor
in
determining
their
completion
the
implies
that
it
makes
a
difference
how
the
given
is
terminated
that
one
outcome
is
better
than
another
and
that
the
proposition
is
to
be
a
factor
in
securing
as
far
as
may
be
the
better
in
other
words
there
is
something
objectively
at
stake
in
the
forming
of
the
proposition
a
right
or
wrong
judgment
a
judgment
confined
to
the
given
whether
temporal
spatial
or
subsistent
does
not
affect
its
it
does
not
help
or
hinder
its
development
for
by
hypothesis
it
has
no
development
but
a
practical
proposition
affects
the
for
better
or
worse
for
it
is
a
judgment
as
to
the
condition
the
thing
to
be
done
of
the
existence
of
the
complete
a
practical
proposition
is
binary
it
is
a
judgment
that
the
given
is
to
be
treated
in
a
specified
way
it
is
also
a
judgment
that
the
given
admits
of
such
treatment
that
it
admits
of
a
specified
objective
termination
it
is
a
judgment
at
the
same
stroke
of
end
the
result
to
be
brought
about
and
of
means
ethical
theories
which
disconnect
the
discussion
of
ends
as
so
many
of
them
do
from
determination
of
means
thereby
take
discussion
of
ends
out
of
the
region
of
judgment
if
there
be
such
ends
they
have
no
intellectual
status
to
judge
that
i
should
see
a
physician
implies
that
the
given
elements
of
the
situation
should
be
completed
in
a
specific
way
and
also
that
they
afford
the
conditions
which
make
the
proposed
completion
practicable
the
proposition
concerns
both
resources
and
obstacles
intellectual
determination
of
elements
lying
in
the
way
of
say
proper
vigor
and
of
elements
which
can
be
utilized
to
get
around
or
surmount
these
obstacles
the
judgment
regarding
the
need
of
a
physician
implies
the
existence
of
hindrances
in
the
pursuit
of
the
normal
occupations
of
life
but
it
equally
implies
the
existence
of
positive
factors
which
may
be
set
in
motion
to
surmount
the
hindrances
and
reinstate
normal
pursuits
it
is
worth
while
to
call
attention
to
the
reciprocal
character
of
the
practical
judgment
in
its
bearing
upon
the
statement
of
means
from
the
side
of
the
end
the
reciprocal
nature
locates
and
condemns
utopianism
and
romanticism
what
is
sometimes
called
idealism
from
the
side
of
means
it
locates
and
condemns
materialism
and
predeterminism
what
is
sometimes
called
mechanism
by
materialism
i
mean
the
conception
that
the
given
contains
exhaustively
the
entire
of
practical
judgment
that
the
facts
in
their
givenness
are
all
there
is
to
it
the
given
is
undoubtedly
just
what
it
is
it
is
determinate
throughout
but
it
is
the
given
something
to
be
done
the
survey
and
inventory
of
present
conditions
of
facts
are
not
something
complete
in
themselves
they
exist
for
the
sake
of
an
intelligent
determination
of
what
is
to
be
done
of
what
is
required
to
complete
the
given
to
conceive
the
given
in
any
such
way
then
as
to
imply
that
it
negates
in
its
given
character
the
possibility
of
any
doing
of
any
modification
is
as
a
part
of
a
practical
judgment
the
discovery
that
a
man
is
suffering
from
an
illness
is
not
a
discovery
that
he
must
suffer
or
that
the
subsequent
course
of
events
is
determined
by
his
illness
it
is
the
indication
of
a
needed
and
a
possible
course
by
which
to
restore
health
even
the
discovery
that
the
illness
is
hopeless
falls
within
this
principle
it
is
an
indication
not
to
waste
time
and
money
on
certain
fruitless
endeavors
to
prepare
affairs
with
respect
to
death
etc
it
is
also
an
indication
of
search
for
conditions
which
will
render
in
the
future
similar
cases
remediable
not
hopeless
the
whole
case
for
the
genuineness
of
practical
judgments
stands
or
falls
with
this
principle
it
is
open
to
question
but
decision
as
to
its
validity
must
rest
upon
empirical
evidence
it
can
not
be
ruled
out
of
court
by
a
dialectic
development
of
the
implications
of
propositions
about
what
is
already
given
or
what
has
already
happened
that
is
its
invalidity
can
not
be
deduced
from
an
assertion
that
the
character
of
the
scientific
judgment
as
a
discovery
and
statement
of
what
is
forbids
it
much
less
from
an
analysis
of
mathematical
propositions
for
this
method
only
begs
the
question
unless
the
facts
are
complicated
by
the
surreptitious
introduction
of
some
preconception
the
prima
facie
empirical
case
is
that
the
scientific
judgment
the
determinate
diagnosis
favors
instead
of
forbidding
the
doctrine
of
a
possibility
of
change
of
the
given
to
overthrow
this
presumption
means
i
repeat
to
discover
specific
evidence
which
makes
it
impossible
and
in
view
of
the
immense
body
of
empirical
evidence
showing
that
we
add
to
control
of
what
is
given
the
of
scientific
judgment
by
means
of
scientific
judgment
the
likelihood
of
any
such
discovery
seems
slight
these
considerations
throw
light
upon
the
proper
meaning
of
practical
idealism
and
of
mechanism
idealism
in
action
does
not
seem
to
be
anything
except
an
explicit
recognition
of
just
the
implications
we
have
been
considering
it
signifies
a
recognition
that
the
given
is
given
obstacles
to
one
course
of
active
development
or
completion
and
resources
for
another
course
by
which
development
of
the
situation
directly
blocked
may
be
indirectly
secured
it
is
not
a
blind
instinct
of
hopefulness
or
that
miscellaneous
obscurantist
emotionalism
often
called
optimism
any
more
than
it
is
utopianism
it
is
recognition
of
the
increased
liberation
and
redirection
of
the
course
of
events
achieved
through
accurate
discovery
or
more
specifically
it
is
this
recognition
operating
as
a
ruling
motive
in
extending
the
work
of
discovery
and
utilizing
its
results
mechanism
means
the
reciprocal
recognition
on
the
side
of
means
it
is
the
recognition
of
the
import
within
the
practical
judgment
of
the
given
of
fact
in
its
determinate
character
the
facts
in
their
isolation
taken
as
complete
in
themselves
are
not
mechanistic
at
most
they
just
are
and
that
is
the
end
of
them
they
are
mechanistic
as
indicating
the
mechanism
the
means
of
accomplishing
the
possibilities
which
they
indicate
apart
from
a
forward
look
the
anticipation
of
the
future
movement
of
affairs
mechanism
is
a
meaningless
conception
there
is
no
sense
in
applying
the
conception
to
a
finished
world
to
any
scene
which
is
simply
and
only
done
with
propositions
regarding
a
past
world
just
as
past
not
as
furnishing
the
conditions
of
what
is
to
be
done
might
be
complete
and
accurate
but
they
would
be
of
the
nature
of
a
complex
catalogue
to
introduce
in
addition
the
conception
of
mechanism
is
to
introduce
the
implication
of
possibilities
of
future
accomplishment
the
judgment
of
what
is
to
be
done
implies
as
we
have
just
seen
a
statement
of
what
the
given
facts
of
the
situation
are
taken
as
indications
of
the
course
to
pursue
and
of
the
means
to
be
employed
in
its
pursuit
such
a
statement
demands
accuracy
completeness
is
not
so
much
an
additional
requirement
as
it
is
a
condition
of
accuracy
for
accuracy
depends
fundamentally
upon
relevancy
to
the
determination
of
what
is
to
be
done
completeness
does
not
mean
exhaustiveness
but
adequacy
as
respects
end
and
its
means
to
include
too
much
or
what
is
irrelevant
is
a
violation
of
the
demand
for
accuracy
quite
as
well
as
to
leave
out
to
fail
to
discover
what
is
important
clear
recognition
of
this
fact
will
enable
one
to
avoid
certain
dialectic
confusions
it
has
been
argued
that
a
judgment
of
given
existence
or
fact
can
not
be
hypothetical
that
factuality
and
hypothetical
character
are
contradictions
in
terms
they
would
be
if
the
two
qualifications
were
used
in
the
same
respect
but
they
are
not
the
hypothesis
is
that
the
facts
which
constitute
the
terms
of
the
proposition
of
the
given
are
relevant
and
adequate
for
the
purpose
in
hand
the
determination
of
a
possibility
to
be
accomplished
in
action
the
data
may
be
as
factual
as
absolute
as
you
please
and
yet
in
no
way
guarantee
that
they
are
the
data
this
particular
judgment
suppose
the
thing
to
be
done
is
the
formation
of
a
prediction
regarding
the
return
of
a
comet
the
prime
difficulty
is
not
in
making
observations
or
in
the
mathematical
calculations
based
upon
them
difficult
as
these
things
may
be
it
is
making
sure
that
we
have
taken
as
data
the
observations
really
implicated
in
the
doing
rightly
of
this
particular
thing
that
we
have
not
left
out
something
which
is
relevant
or
included
something
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
further
movement
of
the
comet
darwin
hypothesis
of
natural
selection
does
not
stand
or
fall
with
the
correctness
of
his
propositions
regarding
breeding
of
animals
in
domestication
the
facts
of
artificial
selection
may
be
as
stated
in
themselves
there
may
be
nothing
hypothetical
about
them
but
their
bearing
upon
the
origin
of
species
a
hypothesis
logically
any
factual
proposition
is
a
hypothetical
proposition
when
it
is
made
the
basis
of
any
inference
the
bearing
of
this
remark
upon
the
nature
of
the
truth
of
practical
judgments
including
the
judgment
of
what
is
given
is
obvious
their
truth
or
falsity
is
constituted
by
the
issue
the
determination
of
constituting
the
terms
and
relations
of
the
practical
proposition
is
hypothetical
until
the
course
of
action
indicated
has
been
tried
the
event
or
issue
of
such
action
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
judgment
this
is
an
immediate
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
only
the
issue
gives
the
complete
in
this
case
at
least
verification
and
truth
completely
coincide
unless
there
is
some
serious
error
in
the
prior
analysis
this
completes
the
account
preliminary
to
a
consideration
of
other
matters
but
the
account
suggests
another
and
independent
question
with
respect
to
which
i
shall
make
an
excursus
how
far
is
it
possible
and
legitimate
to
extend
or
generalize
the
results
reached
to
apply
to
all
propositions
of
facts
that
is
to
say
is
it
possible
and
legitimate
to
treat
all
scientific
or
descriptive
statements
of
matters
of
fact
as
implying
indirectly
if
not
directly
something
to
be
done
future
possibilities
to
be
realized
in
action
the
question
as
to
legitimacy
is
too
complicated
to
be
discussed
in
an
incidental
way
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
such
application
nor
that
the
possibility
is
worth
careful
examination
we
may
frame
at
least
a
hypothesis
that
all
judgments
of
fact
have
reference
to
a
determination
of
courses
of
action
to
be
tried
and
to
the
discovery
of
means
for
their
realization
in
the
sense
already
explained
all
propositions
which
state
discoveries
or
ascertainments
all
categorical
propositions
would
be
hypothetical
and
their
truth
would
coincide
with
their
tested
consequences
effected
by
intelligent
action
this
theory
may
be
called
pragmatism
but
it
is
a
type
of
pragmatism
quite
free
from
dependence
upon
a
voluntaristic
psychology
it
is
not
complicated
by
reference
to
emotional
satisfactions
or
the
play
of
desires
i
am
not
arguing
the
point
but
possibly
critics
of
pragmatism
would
get
a
new
light
upon
its
meaning
were
they
to
set
out
with
an
analysis
of
ordinary
practical
judgments
and
then
proceed
to
consider
the
bearing
of
its
result
upon
judgments
of
facts
and
essences
bertrand
russell
has
remarked
that
pragmatism
originated
as
a
theory
about
the
truth
of
theories
but
ignored
the
truths
of
fact
upon
which
theories
rest
and
by
which
they
are
tested
i
am
not
concerned
to
question
this
so
far
as
the
origin
of
pragmatism
is
concerned
philosophy
at
least
has
been
mainly
a
matter
of
theories
and
james
was
conscientious
enough
to
be
troubled
about
the
way
in
which
the
meaning
of
such
theories
is
to
be
settled
and
the
way
in
which
they
are
to
be
tested
his
pragmatism
was
in
effect
as
russell
recognizes
a
statement
of
the
need
of
applying
to
philosophic
theories
the
same
kinds
of
test
as
are
used
in
the
theories
of
the
inductive
sciences
but
this
does
not
preclude
the
application
of
a
like
method
to
dealing
with
truths
of
fact
facts
may
be
facts
and
yet
not
be
the
facts
the
inquiry
in
hand
in
all
scientific
inquiry
however
to
call
them
facts
or
data
or
truths
of
fact
signifies
that
they
are
taken
as
the
facts
of
the
inference
to
be
made
as
this
would
seem
to
indicate
they
are
then
implicated
however
indirectly
in
a
proposition
about
what
is
to
be
done
they
are
themselves
theoretical
in
logical
quality
accuracy
of
statement
and
correctness
of
reasoning
would
then
be
factors
in
truth
but
so
also
would
be
verification
truth
would
be
a
triadic
relation
but
of
a
different
sort
from
that
expounded
by
russell
for
accuracy
and
correctness
would
both
be
functions
of
verifiability
judgments
of
value
i
it
is
my
purpose
to
apply
the
conclusions
previously
drawn
as
to
the
implications
of
practical
judgment
to
the
subject
of
judgments
of
value
first
i
shall
try
to
clear
away
some
sources
of
misunderstanding
unfortunately
however
there
is
a
ambiguity
which
makes
it
difficult
to
dismiss
the
matter
of
value
summarily
the
of
a
good
and
the
that
something
is
a
value
of
a
certain
kind
and
amount
have
been
almost
inextricably
confused
the
confusion
has
a
long
history
it
is
found
in
mediaeval
thought
it
is
revived
by
descartes
recent
psychology
has
given
it
a
new
career
the
senses
were
regarded
as
modes
of
knowledge
of
greater
or
less
adequacy
and
the
feelings
were
regarded
as
modes
of
sense
and
hence
as
modes
of
cognitive
apprehension
descartes
was
interested
in
showing
for
scientific
purposes
that
the
senses
are
not
organs
of
apprehending
the
qualities
of
bodies
as
such
but
only
of
apprehending
their
relation
to
the
of
the
sentient
organism
sensations
of
pleasure
and
pain
along
with
those
of
hunger
thirst
most
easily
lent
themselves
to
this
treatment

tones
were

assimilated
of
them
all
he
says
these
perceptions
of
sense
have
been
placed
within
me
by
nature
for
the
purpose
of
what
things
are
beneficial
or
harmful
thus
it
was
possible
to
identify
the
real
properties
of
bodies
with
their
geometrical
ones
without
exposing
himself
to
the
conclusion
that
god

us
in

these

as
apprehensions

are
adequate
his
identification
of
any
and
every
experience
of
good
with
a
judgment
or
cognitive
apprehension
is
clear
in
the
following
words
when
we
are
given
news
the
mind
first
judges
of
it
and
if
it
is
good
it
rejoices
this
is
a
survival
of
the
scholastic
psychology
of
the
lotze
theory
that
the
emotions
as
involving
pleasure
and
pain
are
organs
of
value
judgments
or
in
more
recent
terminology
that
they
are
cognitive
appreciations
of
worth
corresponding
to
immediate
apprehensions
of
sensory
qualities
presents
the
same
tradition
in
a
new
terminology
as
against
all
this
the
present
paper
takes
its
stand
with
the
position
stated
by
hume
in
the
following
words
a
passion
is
an
original
existence
or
if
you
will
modification
of
existence
and
contains
not
any
representative
quality
which
renders
it
a
copy
of
any
other
existence
or
modification
when
i
am
angry
i
am
actually
possest
with
the
passion
and
in
that
emotion
have
no
more
a
reference
to
any
other
object
than
when
i
am
thirsty
or
sick
or
more
than
five
feet
high
in
so
doing
i
may
seem
to
some
to
be
begging
the
question
at
issue
but
such
is
surely
the
prima
facie
fact
of
the
matter
only
a
prior
dogma
to
the
effect
that
every
conscious
experience
a
form
of
cognition
leads
to
any
obscuration
of
the
fact
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
those
who
uphold
the
dogma
a
further
word
upon
appreciation
seems
specially
called
for
in
view
of
the
currency
of
the
doctrine
that
appreciation
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
knowledge
or
cognitive
revelation
of
reality
peculiar
in
having
a
distinct
type
of
reality
for
its
object
and
in
having
for
its
organ
a
peculiar
mental
condition
differing
from
the
intelligence
of
everyday
knowledge
and
of
science
actually
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
grounds
for
regarding
appreciation
as
anything
but
an
intentionally
enhanced
or
intensified
experience
of
an
object
its
opposite
is
not
descriptive
or
explanatory
knowledge
but
a
degraded
realization
of
an
object
a
man
may
climb
a
mountain
to
get
a
better
realization
of
a
landscape
he
may
travel
to
greece
to
get
a
realization
of
the
parthenon
more
full
than
that
which
he
has
had
from
pictures
intelligence
knowledge
may
be
involved
in
the
steps
taken
to
get
the
enhanced
experience
but
that
does
not
make
the
landscape
or
the
parthenon
as
fully
savored
a
cognitive
object
so
the
fulness
of
a
musical
experience
may
depend
upon
prior
critical
analysis
but
that
does
not
necessarily
make
the
hearing
of
music
a
kind
of
cognitive
act
either
appreciation
means
just
an
intensified
experience
or
it
means
a
kind
of
criticism
and
then
it
falls
within
the
sphere
of
ordinary
judgment
differing
in
being
applied
to
a
work
of
art
instead
of
to
some
other
the
same
mode
of
analysis
may
be
applied
to
the
older
but
cognate
term
intuition
the
terms
acquaintance
and
familiarity
and
recognition
acknowledgment
are
full
of
like
pitfalls
of
ambiguity
in
contemporary
discussion
of
however
appreciation
is
a
peculiarly
treacherous
term
it
is
first
asserted
or
assumed
that
all
experiences
of
good
are
modes
of
knowing
that
good
is
a
term
of
a
proposition
then
when
experience
forces
home
the
immense
difference
between
evaluation
as
a
critical
process
a
process
of
inquiry
for
the
determination
of
a
good
precisely
similar
to
that
which
is
undertaken
in
science
in
the
determination
of
the
nature
of
an
event
and
ordinary
experience
of
good
and
evil
appeal
is
made
to
the
difference
between
direct
apprehension
and
indirect
or
inferential
knowledge
and
appreciation
is
called
in
to
play
the
convenient
r√¥le
of
an
immediate
cognitive
apprehension
thus
a
second
error
is
used
to
cover
up
and
protect
a
primary
one
to
savor
a
thing
fully
as
arnold
bennett
heroines
are
wont
to
do
is
no
more
a
knowing
than
is
the
chance
savoring
which
arises
when
things
smelled
are
found
good
or
than
is
being
angry
or
thirsty
or
more
than
five
feet
high
all
the
language
which
we
can
employ
is
charged
with
a
force
acquired
through
reflection
even
when
i
speak
of
a
direct
experience
of
a
good
or
bad
one
is
only
too
likely
to
read
in
traits
characterizing
a
thing
which
is
found
in
consequence
of
thinking
to
be
good
one
has
to
use
language
simply
to
stimulate
a
recourse
to
a
direct
experiencing
in
which
language
is
not
depended
upon
if
one
is
willing
to
make
such
an
imaginative
excursion
no
one
can
be
compelled
he
will
note
that
a
thing
good
apart
from
reflective
judgment
means
simply
treating
the
thing
in
a
certain
way
hanging
on
to
it
dwelling
upon
it
welcoming
it
and
acting
to
perpetuate
its
presence
taking
delight
in
it
it
is
a
way
of
behaving
toward
it
a
mode
of
organic
reaction
a
psychologist
may
indeed
bring
in
the
emotions
but
if
his
contribution
is
relevant
it
will
be
because
the
emotions
which
figure
in
his
account
are
just
part
of
the
primary
organic
reaction
to
the
object
in
contrary
fashion
to
find
a
thing
bad
in
a
direct
experience
as
distinct
from
the
result
of
a
reflective
examination
is
to
be
moved
to
reject
it
to
try
to
get
away
from
it
to
destroy
or
at
least
to
displace
it
it
connotes
not
an
act
of
apprehension
but
an
act
of
repugning
of
repelling
to
term
the
thing
good
or
evil
is
to
state
the
fact
noted
in
recollection
that
it
was
actually
involved
in
a
situation
of
organic
acceptance
or
rejection
with
whatever
qualities
specifically
characterize
the
act
all
this
is
said
because
i
am
convinced
that
contemporary
discussion
of
values
and
valuation
suffers
from
confusion
of
the
two
radically
different
attitudes
that
of
direct
active
experience
of
goods
and
bads
and
that
of
valuation
the
latter
being
simply
a
mode
of
judgment
like
any
other
form
of
judgment
differing
in
that
its
happens
to
be
a
good
or
a
bad
instead
of
a
horse
or
planet
or
curve
but
unfortunately
for
discussions
to
value
means
two
radically
different
things
to
prize
and
appraise
to
esteem
and
to
estimate
to
find
good
in
the
sense
described
above
and
to
judge
it
to
be
good
to
it
as
good
i
call
them
radically
different
because
to
prize
names
a
practical
attitude
and
to
appraise
names
a
judgment
that
men
love
and
hold
things
dear
that
they
cherish
and
care
for
some
things
and
neglect
and
contemn
other
things
is
an
undoubted
fact
to
call
these
things
values
is
just
to
repeat
that
they
are
loved
and
cherished
it
is
not
to
give
a
reason
for
their
being
loved
and
cherished
to
call
them
values
and
then
import
into
them
the
traits
of
objects
of
valuation
or
to
import
into
values
meaning
valuated
objects
the
traits
which
things
possess
as
held
dear
is
to
confuse
the
theory
of
judgments
of
value
past
all
remedy
and
before
coming
to
the
more
technical
discussion
the
currency
of
the
confusion
and
the
bad
result
consequences
may
justify
dwelling
upon
the
matter
the
distinction
may
be
compared
to
that
between
eating
something
and
investigating
the
food
properties
of
the
thing
eaten
a
man
eats
something
it
may
be
said
that
his
very
eating
implies
that
he
it
to
be
food
that
he
judged
it
or
regarded
it
cognitively
and
that
the
question
is
just
whether
he
judged
truly
or
made
a
false
proposition
now
if
anybody
will
condescend
to
a
concrete
experience
he
will
perceive
how
often
a
man
eats
thinking
that
he
puts
into
his
mouth
what
is
set
before
him
from
habit
as
an
infant
does
from
instinct
an
onlooker
or
anyone
who
reflects
is
justified
in
saying
that
he
as
he
judged
the
material
to
be
food
he
is
not
justified
in
saying
that
any
judgment
or
intellectual
determination
has
entered
in
he
has
acted
he
has
behaved
toward
something
as
food
that
is
only
to
say
that
he
has
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
swallowed
it
instead
of
spewing
it
forth
the
object
may
then
be
called
food
but
this
does
not
mean
either
that
it
food
namely
digestible
and
nourishing
material
or
that
the
eater
judged
it
to
be
food
and
so
formed
a
proposition
which
is
true
or
false
the
proposition
would
arise
only
in
case
he
is
in
some
doubt
or
if
he
reflects
that
in
spite
of
his
immediate
attitude
of
aversion
the
thing
is
wholesome
and
his
system
needs
recuperation
etc
or
later
if
the
man
is
ill
a
physician
may
inquire
what
he
ate
and
pronounce
that
something
not
food
at
all
but
poison
in
the
illustration
employed
there
is
no
danger
of
any
harm
arising
from
using
the
retroactive
term
food
there
is
no
likelihood
of
confusing
the
two
senses
actually
eaten
and
nourishing
article
but
with
the
terms
value
and
good
there
is
a
standing
danger
of
just
such
a
confusion
overlooking
the
fact
that
good
and
bad
as
terms
involve
a
to
other
exactly
similar
to
that
implied
in
calling
a
particular
article
food
or
poison
we
suppose
that
when
we
are
reflecting
upon
or
inquiring
into
the
good
or
value
of
some
act
or
object
we
are
dealing
with
something
as
simple
as
as
the
simple
act
of
immediate
prizing
or
welcoming
or
cherishing
performed
without
rhyme
or
reason
from
instinct
or
habit
in
truth
just
as
determining
a
thing
food
means
considering
its
relations
to
digestive
organs
to
its
distribution
and
ultimate
destination
in
the
system
so
determining
a
thing
found
good
namely
treated
in
a
certain
way
good
means
precisely
ceasing
to
look
at
it
as
a
direct
thing
and
considering
it
in
its
consequences
that
is
in
its
relations
to
a
large
set
of
other
things
if
the
man
in
eating
consciously
implies
that
what
he
eats
is
food
he
anticipates
or
predicts
certain
consequences
with
more
or
less
adequate
grounds
for
so
doing
he
passes
a
judgment
or
apprehends
or
knows
truly
or
falsely
so
a
man
may
not
only
enjoy
a
thing
but
he
may
judge
the
thing
enjoyed
to
be
good
to
be
a
value
but
in
so
doing
he
is
going
beyond
the
thing
immediately
present
and
making
an
inference
to
other
things
which
he
implies
are
connected
with
it
the
thing
taken
into
the
mouth
and
stomach
consequences
whether
a
man
thinks
of
them
or
not
but
he
does
not
the
thing
he
eats
he
does
not
make
it
a
term
of
a
certain
character
unless
he
thinks
of
the
consequences
and
connects
them
with
the
thing
he
eats
if
he
just
stops
and
says
oh
how
good
this
is
he
is
not
saying
anything
about
the
object
except
the
fact
that
he
enjoys
eating
it
we
may
if
we
choose
regard
this
exclamation
as
a
reflection
or
judgment
but
if
it
is
intellectual
it
is
asserted
for
the
sake
of
enhancing
the
enjoyment
it
is
a
means
to
an
end
a
very
hungry
man
will
generally
satisfy
his
appetite
to
some
extent
before
he
indulges
in
even
such
rudimentary
propositions
ii
but
we
must
return
to
a
placing
of
our
problem
in
this
context
my
theme
is
that
a
judgment
of
value
is
simply
a
case
of
a
practical
judgment
a
judgment
about
the
doing
of
something
this
conflicts
with
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
judgment
about
a
particular
kind
of
existence
independent
of
action
concerning
which
the
main
problem
is
whether
it
is
subjective
or
objective
it
conflicts
with
every
tendency
to
make
the
determination
of
the
right
or
wrong
course
of
action
whether
in
morals
technology
or
scientific
inquiry
dependent
upon
an
independent
determination
of
some
ghostly
things
called
whether
their
ghostly
character
is
attributed
to
their
existing
in
some
transcendental
eternal
realm
or
in
some
realm
called
states
of
mind
it
asserts
that
mean
simply
objects
as
judged
to
possess
a
certain
within
a
situation
temporally
developing
toward
a
determinate
result
to
a
thing
good
is
i
repeat
to
attribute
or
impute
nothing
to
it
it
is
just
to
do
something
to
it
but
to
consider
it
is
good
and
how
good
it
is
is
to
ask
how
it
if
acted
will
operate
in
promoting
a
course
of
action
hence
the
great
contrast
which
may
exist
between
a
good
or
an
immediate
experience
and
an
evaluated
or
judged
good
the
rain
may
be
most
uncomfortable
just
it
as
a
man
is
more
than
five
feet
tall
and
yet
be
good
for
growing
crops
that
is
favor
or
promote
their
movement
in
a
given
direction
this
does
not
mean
that
two
contrasting
judgments
of
value
are
passed
it
means
that
judgment
has
yet
taken
place
if
however
i
am
moved
to
pass
a
i
should
probably
say
that
in
spite
of
the
disagreeableness
of
getting
wet
the
shower
is
a
good
thing
i
am
now
judging
it
as
a
in
two
contrasting
situations
as
a
means
with
respect
to
two
ends
i
compare
my
discomfort
as
a
of
the
rain
with
the
prospective
crops
as
another
consequence
and
say
let
the
latter
consequence
be
i
identify
myself
as
agent
with
it
rather
than
with
the
immediate
discomfort
of
the
wetting
it
is
quite
true
that
in
this
case
i
can
not
do
anything
about
it
my
identification
is
so
to
speak
sentimental
rather
than
practical
so
far
as
stopping
the
rain
or
growing
the
crops
is
concerned
but
in
effect
it
is
an
assertion
that
one
would
not
on
account
of
the
discomfort
of
the
rain
stop
it
that
one
would
if
one
could
encourage
its
continuance
go
it
rain
one
says
the
specific
intervention
of
action
is
obvious
enough
in
plenty
of
other
cases
it
occurs
to
me
that
this
agreeable
food
which
i
am
eating
is
a
food
for
me
it
brings
on
indigestion
it
functions
no
longer
as
an
good
as
something
to
be
accepted
if
i
continue
eating
it
will
be
after
i
have
deliberated
i
have
considered
it
as
a
means
to
two
conflicting
possible
consequences
the
present
enjoyment
of
eating
and
the
later
state
of
health
one
or
other
is
possible
not
both
though
of
course
i
may
solve
the
problem
by
persuading
myself
that
in
this
instance
they
are
congruent
the
now
means
thing
judged
to
be
a
means
of
procuring
this
or
that
end
as
prizing
esteeming
holding
dear
denote
ways
of
acting
so
valuing
denotes
a
passing
judgment
upon
such
acts
with
reference
to
their
connection
with
other
acts
or
with
respect
to
the
continuum
of
behavior
in
which
they
fall
valuation
means
change
of
mode
of
behavior
from
direct
acceptance
and
welcoming
to
doubting
and
looking
into
acts
which
involve
postponement
of
direct
or
overt
action
and
which
imply
a
future
act
having
a
different
from
that
just
now
occurring
for
even
if
one
decides
to
continue
in
the
previous
act
its
is
different
when
it
is
chosen
after
reflective
examination
a
practical
judgment
has
been
defined
as
a
judgment
of
what
to
do
or
what
is
to
be
done
a
judgment
respecting
the
future
termination
of
an
incomplete
and
in
so
far
indeterminate
situation
to
say
that
judgments
of
value
fall
within
this
field
is
to
say
two
things
one
that
the
judgment
of
value
is
never
complete
in
itself
but
always
in
behalf
of
determining
what
is
to
be
done
the
other
that
judgments
of
value
as
distinct
from
the
direct
experience
of
something
as
good
imply
that
value
is
not
anything
previously
given
but
is
something
to
be
given
by
future
action
itself
conditioned
upon
varying
with
the
judgment
this
statement
may
appear
to
contradict
the
recent
assertion
that
a
for
knowledge
means
one
investigated
as
a
means
to
competing
ends
for
such
a
means
it
already
is
the
lobster
give
me
present
enjoyment
and
future
indigestion
i
eat
it
but
as
long
as
i
judge
is
indeterminate
the
question
is
not
what
the
thing
will
do
i
may
be
quite
clear
about
that
it
is
whether
to
perform
the
act
which
will
actualize
its
potentiality
what
will
i
have
the
situation
as
between
alternatives
and
that
means
what
force
shall
the
thing
as
means
be
given
shall
i
take
it
as
means
to
present
enjoyment
or
as
a
negative
condition
of
future
health
when
its
status
in
these
respects
is
determined
its
value
is
determined
judgment
ceases
action
goes
on
practical
judgments
do
not
therefore
primarily
concern
themselves
with
the
value
of
but
with
the
course
of
action
demanded
to
carry
an
incomplete
situation
to
its
fulfilment
the
adequate
control
of
such
judgments
may
however
be
facilitated
by
judgment
of
the
worth
of
objects
which
enter
as
ends
and
means
into
the
action
contemplated
for
example
my
primary
and
ultimate
judgment
has
to
do
say
with
buying
a
suit
of
clothes
whether
to
buy
and
if
so
what
the
question
is
of
better
and
worse
with
respect
to
alternative
courses
of
action
not
with
respect
to
various
objects
but
the
judgment
will
be
a
judgment
and
not
a
chance
reaction
in
the
degree
in
which
it
takes
for
its
intervening
the
of
various
objects
what
are
the
prices
of
given
suits
what
are
their
styles
in
respect
to
current
fashion
how
do
their
patterns
compare
what
about
their
durability
how
about
their
respective
adaptability
to
the
chief
wearing
use
i
have
in
mind
relative
or
comparative
durability
cheapness
suitability
style
aesthetic
attractiveness
constitute
value
traits
they
are
traits
of
objects
not
but
entering
into
a
possible
and
foreseen
completing
of
the
their
value
is
their
force
in
precisely
this
function
the
decision
of
better
and
worse
is
the
determination
of
their
respective
capacities
and
intensities
this
apart
from
their
status
in
this
office
they
have
no
traits
of
value
for
knowledge
a
determination
of
better
value
as
found
in
some
one
suit
is
equivalent
to
has
the
force
of
a
decision
as
to
what
it
is
better
to
do
it
provided
the
lacking
stimulus
so
that
action
occurs
or
passes
from
its
into
decision
reference
to
the
terms
subjective
and
objective
will
perhaps
raise
a
cloud
of
ambiguities
but
for
this
very
reason
it
may
be
worth
while
to
point
out
the
ambiguous
nature
of
the
term
objective
as
applied
to
valuations
objective
may
be
identified
quite
erroneously
with
qualities
existing
outside
of
and
independently
of
the
situation
in
which
a
decision
as
to
a
future
course
of
action
has
to
be
reached
or
objective
may
denote
the
status
of
qualities
of
an
object
to
the
situation
to
be
completed
through
judgment
independently
of
the
situation
requiring
practical
judgment
clothes
already
have
a
given
price
durability
pattern
etc
these
traits
are
not
affected
by
the
judgment
they
exist
they
are
given
but
as
given
they
are
determinate
values
they
are
not
of
valuation
they
are
a
valuation
we
may
have
to
take
pains
to
discover
that
these
given
qualities
are
but
their
discovery
is
in
order
that
there
may
be
a
subsequent
judgment
of
value
were
they
already
definite
values
they
would
not
be
estimated
they
would
be
stimuli
to
direct
response
if
a
man
had
already
decided
that
cheapness
constituted
value
he
would
simply
take
the
cheapest
suit
offered
what
he
judges
is
the
value
of
cheapness
and
this
depends
upon
its
weight
or
importance
in
the
situation
requiring
action
as
compared
with
durability
style
adaptability
etc
discovery
of
shoddy
would
not
affect
the
durability
of
the
goods
but
it
would
affect
the
value
of
cheapness
that
is
weight
assigned
that
trait
in
influencing
which
it
would
not
do
if
cheapness
already
had
a
definite
value
a
value
in
short
means
a
and
a
consideration
does
not
mean
an
existence
merely
but
an
existence
having
a
claim
upon
judgment
value
judged
is
not
existential
quality
noted
but
is
the
influence
attached
by
judgment
to
a
given
existential
quality
in
determining
judgment
the
conclusion
is
not
that
value
is
subjective
but
that
it
is
practical
the
situation
in
which
judgment
of
value
is
required
is
not
mental
much
less
fanciful
i
can
but
think
that
much
of
the
recent
discussion
of
the
objectivity
of
value
and
of
rests
upon
a
false
psychological
theory
it
rests
upon
giving
certain
terms
meanings
that
flow
from
an
introspective
psychology
which
accepts
a
realm
of
purely
private
states
of
consciousness
private
not
in
a
social
sense
a
sense
implying
courtesy
or
mayhap
secrecy
toward
others
but
existential
independence
and
separateness
to
refer
value
to
choice
or
desire
for
example
is
in
that
case
to
say
that
value
is
subjectively
conditioned
quite
otherwise
if
we
have
steered
clear
from
such
a
psychology
choice
decision
means
primarily
a
certain
act
a
piece
of
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
particular
thing
that
a
horse
chooses
to
eat
hay
means
only
that
it
eats
hay
that
the
man
chooses
to
steal
means
at
least
that
he
tries
to
steal
this
trial
may
come
however
an
intervening
act
of
reflection
it
then
has
a
certain
intellectual
or
cognitive
quality
but
it
may
mean
simply
the
bare
fact
of
an
action
which
is
retrospectively
called
a
choice
as
a
man
in
spite
of
all
temptation
to
belong
to
another
nation
chooses
to
be
born
an
englishman
which
if
it
has
any
sense
at
all
signifies
a
choice
to
continue
in
a
line
adopted
without
choice
taken
in
this
latter
sense
in
which
case
terms
like
choice
and
desire
refer
to
ways
of
behavior
their
use
is
only
a
specification
of
the
general
doctrine
that
all
valuation
has
to
do
with
the
determination
of
a
course
of
action
choice
preference
is
originally
only
a
bias
in
a
given
direction
a
bias
which
is
no
more
subjective
or
psychical
than
is
the
fact
that
a
ball
thrown
is
swerving
in
a
particular
direction
rather
than
in
some
other
curve
it
is
just
a
name
for
the
differential
character
of
the
action
but
let
continuance
in
a
certain
line
of
action
become
questionable
let
that
is
to
say
it
be
regarded
as
a
means
to
a
future
consequence
which
consequence
has
alternatives
and
then
choice
gets
a
logical
or
intellectual
sense
a
status
if
the
term
mental
is
reserved
for
acts
having
this
intellectualized
quality
choice
still
means
the
fixing
of
a
course
of
action
it
means
at
least
a
to
be
released
as
soon
as
physically
possible
otherwise
man
has
not
chosen
but
has
quieted
himself
into
a
belief
that
he
has
chosen
in
order
to
relieve
himself
of
the
strain
of
suspense
exactly
the
same
analysis
applies
to
desire
diverse
anticipated
ends
may
provoke
divided
and
competing
present
reactions
the
organism
may
be
torn
between
different
courses
each
interfering
with
the
completion
of
the
other
this
pulling
and
hauling
this
strife
of
active
tendencies
is
a
genuine
phenomenon
the
pull
in
a
given
direction
measures
the
immediate
hold
of
an
anticipated
termination
or
end
upon
us
as
compared
with
that
of
some
other
if
one
asked
after
the
mechanism
of
the
valuing
process
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
answer
would
be
in
terms
of
desires
thus
conceived
but
unless
everything
relating
to
the
activity
of
a
highly
organized
being
is
to
be
denominated
subjective
i
see
no
ground
for
calling
it
subjective
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
emphasis
upon
a
psychological
treatment
of
value
and
valuation
in
a
subjective
sense
is
but
a
highly
awkward
and
negative
way
of
maintaining
a
positive
truth
that
value
and
valuation
fall
within
the
universe
of
that
as
welcoming
accepting
is
an
act
so
valuation
is
a
present
act
determining
an
act
done
a
present
act
taking
place
because
the
future
act
is
uncertain
and
incomplete
it
does
follow
from
this
fact
that
valuation
is
not
simply
a
of
the
force
or
efficiency
of
a
means
with
respect
to
continuing
a
process
for
unless
there
is
about
its
continuation
about
its
termination
valuation
will
not
occur
and
there
is
no
question
save
where
activity
is
hesitant
in
direction
because
of
conflict
within
it
metaphorically
we
may
say
that
rain
is
good
to
lay
the
dust
identifying
force
or
efficiency
with
value
i
do
not
believe
that
valuations
occur
and
values
are
brought
into
being
save
in
a
continuing
situation
where
things
have
potency
for
carrying
forward
processes
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
prevailing
valiancy
valency
and
value
but
the
term
value
is
not
a
mere
reduplication
of
the
term
efficiency
it
adds
something
when
we
are
moving
toward
a
result
and
at
the
same
time
are
stimulated
to
move
toward
something
else
which
is
incompatible
with
it
as
in
the
case
of
the
lobster
as
a
cause
of
both
enjoyment
and
indigestion
a
thing
has
a
dual
potency
not
until
the
end
has
been
established
is
the
value
of
the
lobster
settled
although
there
need
be
no
doubt
about
its
efficiencies
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
the
practical
judgment
determines
means
and
end
at
the
same
time
how
then
can
value
be
given
as
efficiency
is
given
until
the
end
is
chosen
the
rain
is
metaphorically
valuable
for
laying
dust
whether
it
is
valuable
for
us
to
have
the
dust
laid
and
if
so
how
valuable
we
shall
never
know
until
some
activity
of
our
own
which
is
a
factor
in
comes
into
conflict
with
an
incompatible
activity
its
value
is
its
force
indeed
but
it
is
its
force
in
moving
us
to
one
end
than
to
another
not
every
potency
in
other
words
but
potency
with
the
specific
qualification
of
falling
within
judgment
about
future
action
means
value
or
valuable
thing
consequently
there
is
no
value
save
in
situations
where
desires
and
the
need
of
deliberation
in
order
to
choose
are
found
and
yet
this
fact
gives
no
excuse
for
regarding
desire
and
deliberation
and
decision
as
subjective
phenomena
to
use
an
irish
bull
as
long
as
a
man
what
he
desires
there
is
no
desire
there
is
movement
or
endeavor
in
a
given
direction
desire
is
desires
and
simultaneous
desires
are
incompatible
they
mark
as
we
have
noted
competing
activities
movements
in
directions
which
can
not
both
be
extended
reflection
is
a
process
of
finding
out
what
we
want
what
as
we
say
we
want
and
this
means
the
formation
of
new
desire
a
new
direction
of
action
in
this
process
things
values
something
they
did
not
possess
before
although
they
had
their
efficiencies
at
whatever
risk
of
shock
this
doctrine
should
be
exposed
in
all
its
nakedness
to
judge
value
is
to
engage
in
instituting
a
determinate
value
where
none
is
given
it
is
not
necessary
that
antecedently
given
values
should
be
the
data
of
the
valuation
and
where
they
are
given
data
they
are
only
terms
in
the
determination
of
a
not
yet
existing
value
when
a
man
is
ill
and
after
deliberation
concludes
that
it
be
well
to
see
a
doctor
the
doctor
doubtless
exists
antecedently
but
it
is
not
the
doctor
who
is
judged
to
be
the
good
of
the
situation
but
the
of
the
doctor
a
thing
which
by
description
exists
only
because
of
an
act
dependent
upon
a
judgment
nor
is
the
health
the
man
antecedently
possessed
or
which
somebody
has
the
thing
which
he
judges
to
be
a
value
the
thing
judged
to
be
a
value
is
the
restoring
of
health
something
by
description
not
yet
existing
the
results
flowing
from
his
past
health
will
doubtless
influence
him
in
reaching
his
judgment
that
it
will
be
a
good
to
have
restored
health
but
they
do
not
constitute
the
good
which
forms
his
and
object
of
his
judgment
he
may
judge
that
they
good
without
judging
that
they
are
now
good
for
to
be
judged
now
good
means
to
be
judged
to
be
the
object
of
a
course
of
action
still
to
be
undertaken
and
to
that
they
were
good
as
distinct
from
merely
recalling
certain
benefits
which
accrued
from
health
is
to
judge
that
the
situation
had
required
a
reflective
determination
of
a
course
of
action
one
would
have
judged
health
an
existence
to
be
attained
or
preserved
by
action
there
are
dialectic
difficulties
which
may
be
raised
about
judgments
of
this
sort
for
they
imply
the
seeming
paradox
of
a
judgment
whose
proper
is
its
own
determinate
formation
but
nothing
is
gained
by
obscuring
the
fact
that
such
is
the
nature
of
the
practical
judgment
it
is
a
judgment
of
what
and
how
to
judge
of
the
weight
to
be
assigned
to
various
factors
in
the
determination
of
judgment
it
would
be
interesting
to
inquire
into
the
question
whether
this
peculiarity
may
not
throw
light
upon
the
nature
of
consciousness
but
into
that
field
we
can
not
now
go
iii
from
what
has
been
said
it
immediately
follows
of
course
that
a
determinate
value
is
instituted
as
a
decisive
factor
with
respect
to
what
is
to
be
done
wherever
a
determinate
good
exists
there
is
an
adequate
stimulus
to
action
and
no
judgment
of
what
is
to
be
done
or
of
the
value
of
an
object
is
called
for
it
is
frequently
assumed
however
that
valuation
is
a
process
of
applying
some
fixed
or
determinate
value
to
the
various
competing
goods
of
a
situation
that
valuation
implies
a
prior
standard
of
value
and
consists
in
comparing
various
goods
with
the
standard
as
the
supreme
value
this
assumption
requires
examination
if
it
is
sound
it
deprives
the
position
which
has
been
taken
of
any
validity
for
it
renders
the
judgment
of
what
to
do
a
matter
of
applying
a
value
existing
instead
of
making
as
we
have
done
the
valuation
a
determination
within
the
practical
judgment
the
argument
would
run
this
way
every
practical
judgment
depends
upon
a
judgment
of
the
value
of
the
end
to
be
attained
this
end
may
be
such
only
proximately
but
that
implies
something
else
judged
to
be
good
and
so
logically
till
we
have
arrived
at
the
judgment
of
a
supreme
good
a
final
end
or
if
this
statement
correctly
describes
the
state
of
the
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
practical
judgment
depends
upon
a
prior
recognition
of
value
consequently
the
hypothesis
upon
which
we
have
been
proceeding
reverses
the
actual
facts
the
first
thing
by
way
of
critical
comment
is
to
point
out
the
ambiguity
in
the
term
end
i
should
like
to
fall
back
upon
what
was
said
earlier
about
the
thoroughly
reciprocal
character
of
means
and
end
in
the
practical
judgment
if
this
be
admitted
it
is
also
admitted
that
only
by
a
judgment
of
means
things
having
value
in
the
carrying
of
an
indeterminate
situation
to
a
completion
is
the
end
determinately
made
out
in
judgment
but
i
fear
i
can
not
count
upon
this
as
granted
so
i
will
point
out
that
end
may
mean
either
the
limit
to
judgment
which
by
definition
does
not
enter
into
judgment
at
all
or
it
may
mean
the
last
and
completing
object
of
judgment
the
conception
of
that
object
in
which
a
transitive
incompletely
given
situation
would
come
to
rest
of
end
in
the
first
sense
it
is
to
be
said
that
it
is
not
a
value
at
all
of
end
in
the
second
sense
that
it
is
identical
with
a
finale
of
the
kind
we
have
just
been
discussing
or
that
it
is
determined
in
judgment
not
a
value
given
by
which
to
control
the
judgment
it
may
be
asserted
that
in
the
illustration
used
some
typical
suit
of
clothes
is
the
value
which
affords
the
standard
of
valuation
of
all
the
suits
which
are
offered
to
the
buyer
that
he
passes
judgment
on
their
value
as
compared
with
the
standard
suit
as
an
end
and
supreme
value
this
statement
brings
out
the
ambiguity
just
referred
to
the
need
of
something
to
wear
is
the
to
the
judgment
of
the
value
of
suits
offered
and
possession
of
a
suit
puts
an
end
judgment
it
is
an
end
judgment
in
the
objective
not
in
the
possessive
sense
of
the
preposition
of
it
is
an
end
not
in
the
sense
of
aim
but
in
the
sense
of
a
terminating
limit
when
possession
begins
judgment
has
already
ceased
and
if
argument
has
any
weight
i
may
point
out
that
this
is
the
doctrine
of
aristotle
when
he
says
we
never
deliberate
about
ends
but
only
about
means
that
is
to
say
in
all
deliberation
or
practical
judgment
or
inquiry
there
is
always
something
outside
of
judgment
which
fixes
its
beginning
and
end
or
terminus
and
i
would
add
that
according
to
aristotle
deliberation
always
ceases
when
we
have
come
to
the
first
link
in
the
chain
of
causes
which
is
last
in
the
order
of
discovery
and
this
means
when
we
have
traced
back
the
chain
of
causes
means
to
ourselves
in
other
words
the
last
is
always
that
which
operates
as
the
direct
or
immediate
means
of
setting
our
own
powers
in
operation
the
upon
which
judgment
of
action
settles
down
is
simply
the
adequate
or
complete
means
to
the
doing
of
something
we
do
deliberate
however
about
about
a
fact
which
shows
their
radically
different
nature
from
ends
as
limits
to
deliberation
the
aim
in
the
present
instance
is
not
the
suit
of
clothes
but
the
of
a
suit
that
is
what
is
precisely
estimated
or
valuated
and
i
think
i
may
claim
to
have
shown
that
the
determination
of
this
aim
is
identical
with
the
determination
of
the
value
of
a
suit
through
comparison
of
the
values
of
cheapness
durability
style
pattern
of
different
suits
offered
value
is
not
determined
by
comparing
various
suits
with
an
ideal
model
but
by
comparing
various
suits
with
respect
to
cheapness
durability
adaptability
one
involving
of
course
reference
also
to
length
of
purse
suits
already
possessed
and
other
specific
elements
in
the
situation
which
demands
that
something
be
done
the
purchaser
may
of
course
have
settled
upon
something
which
serves
as
a
model
before
he
goes
to
buy
but
that
only
means
that
his
judging
has
been
done
beforehand
the
model
does
not
then
function
in
judgment
but
in
his
act
as
stimulus
to
immediate
action
and
there
is
a
consideration
here
involved
of
the
utmost
importance
as
to
practical
judgments
of
the
moral
type
the
more
completely
the
notion
of
the
model
is
formed
outside
and
irrespective
of
the
specific
conditions
which
the
situation
of
action
presents
the
less
intelligent
is
the
act
most
men
might
have
their
ideals
of
the
model
changed
somewhat
in
the
face
of
the
actual
offering
even
in
the
case
of
buying
clothes
the
man
who
is
not
accessible
to
such
change
in
the
case
of
moral
situations
has
ceased
to
be
a
moral
agent
and
become
a
reacting
machine
in
short
the
standard
of
valuation
is
formed
in
the
process
of
practical
judgment
or
valuation
it
is
not
something
taken
from
outside
and
applied
within
it
such
application
means
there
is
no
judgment
iv
nothing
has
been
said
thus
far
about
a
standard
yet
the
conception
of
a
standard
or
a
measure
is
so
closely
connected
with
valuation
that
its
consideration
affords
a
test
of
the
conclusions
reached
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
concepts
of
the
nature
of
a
standard
pointed
to
by
the
course
of
the
prior
discussion
is
not
in
conformity
with
current
conceptions
for
the
argument
points
to
a
standard
which
is
determined
within
the
process
of
valuation
not
outside
of
it
and
hence
not
capable
of
being
employed
therefore
to
settle
the
valuing
process
to
many
persons
this
will
seem
absurd
to
the
point
of
the
prevailing
conception
however
has
been
adopted
without
examination
it
is
a
preconception
if
accepted
it
deprives
judgment
and
knowledge
of
all
significant
import
in
connection
with
moral
action
if
the
standard
is
already
given
all
that
remains
is
its
mechanical
application
to
the
case
in
hand
as
one
would
apply
a
yard
rule
to
genuine
moral
uncertainty
is
then
impossible
where
it
seems
to
exist
it
is
only
a
name
for
a
moral
unwillingness
due
to
inherent
viciousness
to
recognize
and
apply
the
rules
already
made
and
provided
or
else
for
a
moral
corruption
which
has
enfeebled
man
power
of
moral
apprehension
when
the
doctrine
of
standards
prior
to
and
independent
of
moral
judgments
is
accompanied
by
these
other
doctrines
of
original
sin
and
corruption
one
must
respect
the
thoroughgoing
logic
of
the
doctrine
such
is
not
however
the
case
with
the
modern
theories
which
make
the
same
assumption
of
standards
preceding
instead
of
resulting
from
moral
judgments
and
which
ignore
the
question
of
uncertainty
and
error
in
their
apprehension
such
considerations
do
not
indeed
decide
anything
but
they
may
serve
to
get
a
more
unprejudiced
hearing
for
a
hypothesis
which
runs
counter
to
current
theories
since
it
but
formulates
the
trend
of
current
practices
in
their
increasing
tendency
to
make
the
act
of
intelligence
the
central
factor
in
morals
let
us
accordingly
consider
the
alternatives
to
regarding
the
standard
of
value
as
something
evolved
in
the
process
of
reflective
valuation
how
can
such
a
standard
be
known
either
by
an
a
priori
method
of
intuition
or
by
abstraction
from
prior
cases
the
latter
conception
throws
us
into
the
arms
of
hedonism
for
the
hedonistic
theory
of
the
standard
of
value
derives
its
logical
efficiency
from
the
consideration
that
the
notion
of
a
prior
and
fixed
standard
one
which
is
not
determined
within
the
situation
by
reflection
forces
us
back
upon
antecedent
irreducible
pleasures
and
pains
which
alone
are
values
definite
and
certain
enough
to
supply
standards
they
alone
are
simple
enough
to
be
independent
and
ultimate
the
apparently
alternative
would
be
to
take
the
value
of
prior
situations
say
the
value
of
an
act
of
kindness
to
a
sufferer
but
any
such
good
is
a
function
of
the
total
unanalyzed
situation
it
has
consequently
no
application
to
a
new
situation
unless
the
new
exactly
repeats
the
old
one
only
when
the
good
is
resolved
into
simple
and
unalterable
units
in
terms
of
which
old
situations
can
be
equated
to
new
ones
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
units
contained
can
an
unambiguous
standard
be
found
the
logic
is
unimpeachable
and
points
to
irreducible
pleasures
and
pains
as
the
standard
of
valuation
the
difficulty
is
not
in
the
logic
but
in
empirical
facts
facts
which
verify
our
prior
contention
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
are
definite
existences
such
as
are
called
pleasures
and
pains
they
are
but
are
only
things
to
be
valued
exactly
the
same
pleasure
or
pain
as
an
existence
has
different
values
at
different
times
according
to
the
way
in
which
it
is
judged
what
is
the
value
of
the
pleasure
of
eating
the
lobster
as
compared
with
the
pains
of
indigestion
the
rule
tells
us
of
course
to
break
up
the
pleasure
and
pain
into
elementary
units
and
count
such
ultimate
simple
units
seem
however
to
be
about
as
much
within
the
reach
of
ordinary
knowledge
as
atoms
or
electrons
are
within
the
grasp
of
the
man
of
the
street
their
resemblance
to
the
ultimate
neutral
units
which
analytic
psychologists
have
postulated
as
a
methodological
necessity
is
evident
since
the
value
of
even
such
a
definite
entity
as
a
toothache
varies
according
to
the
organization
constructed
and
presented
in
reflection
it
is
clear
that
ordinary
empirical
pleasures
and
pains
are
highly
complex
this
difficulty
however
may
be
waived
we
may
even
waive
the
fact
that
a
theory
which
set
out
to
be
is
now
enmeshed
in
the
need
for
making
empirical
facts
meet
dialectical
requirements
another
difficulty
is
too
insuperable
to
be
waived
in
any
case
the
quantity
of
elementary
existences
which
constitutes
the
criterion
of
measurement
is
dependent
upon
the
very
judgment
which
is
assumed
to
be
regulated
by
it
the
standard
of
valuation
is
the
units
which
will
from
an
act
they
are
future
consequences
now
the
character
of
the
agent
judging
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
production
of
these
consequences
a
callous
person
not
only
will
not
foresee
certain
consequences
and
will
not
be
able
to
give
them
proper
weight
but
he
does
not
afford
the
same
condition
of
their
occurrence
which
is
constituted
by
a
sensitive
man
it
is
quite
possible
to
employ
judgment
so
as
to
produce
acts
which
will
increase
this
organic
callousness
the
analytic
conception
of
the
moral
criterion
provides
logically
for
deliberate
blunting
of
susceptibilities
if
the
matter
at
issue
is
simply
one
of
number
of
units
of
pleasure
over
pain
arrange
matters
so
that
certain
pains
will
not
as
matter
of
fact
be
felt
while
this
result
may
be
achieved
by
manipulation
of
conditions
it
may
also
be
effected
by
rendering
the
organism
insensitive
persistence
in
a
course
which
in
the
short
run
yields
uneasiness
and
sympathetic
pangs
will
in
the
long
run
eliminate
these
pains
and
leave
a
net
pleasure
balance
this
is
a
criticism
of
hedonism
my
present
concern
with
it
is
purely
logical
it
shows
that
the
attempt
to
bring
over
from
past
objects
the
elements
of
a
standard
for
valuing
future
consequences
is
a
hopeless
one
the
express
object
of
a
is
to
release
factors
which
being
new
can
not
be
measured
on
the
basis
of
the
past
alone
this
discussion
of
the
analytic
logic
as
applied
in
morals
would
however
probably
not
be
worth
while
did
it
not
serve
to
throw
into
relief
the
significance
of
any
appeal
to
fulfilment
of
a
system
or
organization
as
moral
good
the
standard
such
an
appeal
if
it
is
wary
is
an
appeal
to
the
present
situation
as
that
reorganization
that
will
confer
upon
it
the
unification
which
it
to
organization
as
something
to
be
brought
about
to
be
made
and
it
is
clear
that
this
appeal
meets
all
the
specifications
of
judgments
of
practice
as
they
have
been
described
the
organization
which
is
to
be
fulfilled
through
action
is
an
organization
which
at
the
time
of
judging
is
present
in
conception
in
idea
in
that
is
reflective
inquiry
as
a
phase
of
reorganizing
activity
and
since
its
presence
in
conception
is
both
a
condition
of
the
organization
aimed
at
a
function
of
the
adequacy
of
the
reflective
inquiry
it
is
evident
that
there
is
here
a
confirmation
of
our
statement
that
the
practical
judgment
is
a
judgment
of
what
and
how
to
judge
as
an
integral
part
of
the
completion
of
an
incomplete
temporal
situation
more
specifically
it
also
appears
that
the
standard
is
a
rule
for
conducting
inquiry
to
its
completion
it
is
a
counsel
to
make
examination
of
the
operative
factors
complete
a
warning
against
suppressing
recognition
of
any
of
them
however
a
man
may
impose
upon
himself
or
upon
others
a
real
measure
of
value
is
exhibited
in
what
he
not
in
what
he
consciously
thinks
or
says
for
the
doing
is
the
choice
it
is
the
completed
reflection
it
is
comparatively
easy
at
the
present
time
in
moral
theory
to
slam
both
hedonism
and
apriorism
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
the
logical
implications
of
the
alternative
to
them
the
conception
of
an
organization
of
interests
or
tendencies
is
often
treated
as
if
it
were
a
conception
which
is
definite
in
as
well
as
in
form
it
is
taken
not
as
a
rule
for
procedure
in
inquiry
a
direction
and
a
warning
which
it
is
but
as
something
all
of
whose
constituents
are
already
given
for
even
though
not
given
in
fact
the
act
of
fulfilling
or
realizing
must
then
be
treated
as
devoid
of
intellectual
import
it
is
a
mere
doing
not
a
learning
and
a
testing
but
how
can
a
situation
which
is
incomplete
in
fact
be
completely
known
until
it
complete
short
of
the
fulfilment
of
a
conceived
organization
how
can
the
conception
of
the
proposed
organization
be
anything
more
than
a
working
hypothesis
a
method
of
treating
the
given
elements
in
order
to
see
what
happens
does
not
every
notion
which
implies
the
possibility
of
an
apprehension
of
knowledge
of
the
end
to
be
reached
also
imply
either
an
a
priori
revelation
of
the
nature
of
that
end
or
else
that
organization
is
nothing
but
a
whole
composed
of
elementary
parts
already
given
the
logic
of
hedonism
the
logic
of
subsumption
in
the
physical
sciences
meant
that
a
given
state
of
things
could
be
compared
with
a
concept
as
a
model
the
phenomena
of
the
heavens
with
the
implications
of
say
the
circle
the
methods
of
experimental
science
broke
down
this
motion
they
substituted
for
an
alleged
regulative
model
a
formula
which
was
the
integrated
function
of
the
particular
phenomena
themselves
a
formula
to
be
used
as
a
method
of
further
observations
and
experiments
and
thereby
tested
and
developed
the
unwillingness
to
believe
that
in
a
similar
fashion
moral
standards
or
models
can
be
trusted
to
develop
out
of
the
specific
situations
of
action
shows
how
little
the
general
logical
force
of
the
method
of
science
has
been
grasped
physical
knowledge
did
not
as
matter
of
fact
advance
till
the
dogma
of
models
or
forms
as
standards
of
knowledge
had
been
ousted
yet
we
hang
tenaciously
to
a
like
doctrine
in
morals
for
fear
of
moral
chaos
it
once
seemed
to
be
impossible
that
the
disordered
phenomena
of
perception
could
generate
a
knowledge
of
law
and
order
it
was
supposed
that
independent
principles
of
order
must
be
supplied
and
the
phenomena
measured
by
approach
to
or
deviation
from
the
fixed
models
the
ordinary
conception
of
a
standard
in
practical
affairs
is
a
precise
analogue
physical
knowledge
started
on
a
secure
career
when
men
had
courage
to
start
from
the
irregular
scene
and
to
treat
the
suggestions
to
which
it
gave
rise
as
methods
for
instituting
new
observations
and
experiences
acting
upon
the
suggested
conceptions
analyzed
extended
and
ordered
phenomena
and
thus
made
improved
conceptions
methods
of
inquiry
possible
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
what
holds
moral
knowledge
back
is
above
all
the
conception
that
there
are
standards
of
good
given
to
knowledge
apart
from
the
work
of
reflection
in
constructing
methods
of
action
as
the
bringer
of
bad
news
gets
a
bad
name
being
made
to
share
in
the
production
of
the
evil
which
he
reports
so
honest
acknowledgment
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
moral
situation
and
of
the
hypothetical
character
of
all
rules
of
moral
mensuration
prior
to
acting
upon
them
is
treated
as
if
it
originated
the
uncertainty
and
created
the
skepticism
it
may
be
contended
however
that
all
this
does
not
justify
the
earlier
statement
that
the
limiting
situation
which
occasions
and
cuts
off
judgment
is
not
itself
a
value
why
it
will
be
asked
does
a
man
buy
a
suit
of
clothes
unless
that
is
a
value
or
at
least
a
proximate
means
to
a
further
value
the
answer
is
short
and
simple
because
he
has
to
because
the
situation
in
which
he
lives
demands
it
the
answer
probably
seems
too
summary
but
it
may
suggest
that
while
a
man
lives
he
never
is
called
upon
to
judge
whether
he
shall
act
but
simply
he
shall
act
a
decision
not
to
act
is
a
decision
to
act
in
a
certain
way
it
is
never
a
judgment
not
to
act
unqualifiedly
it
is
a
judgment
to
do
something
else
to
wait
for
example
a
judgment
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
retire
from
active
life
to
become
a
simon
stylites
is
a
judgment
to
act
in
a
certain
way
conditioned
upon
the
necessity
that
irrespective
of
judging
a
man
will
have
to
act
somehow
anyway
a
decision
to
commit
suicide
is
not
a
decision
to
be
dead
it
is
a
decision
to
perform
a
certain
act
the
act
may
depend
upon
reaching
the
conclusion
that
life
is
not
worth
living
but
as
a
judgment
this
is
a
conclusion
to
act
in
a
way
to
terminate
the
possibility
of
further
situations
requiring
judgment
and
action
and
it
does
not
imply
that
a
judgment
about
life
as
a
supreme
value
and
standard
underlies
all
judgments
as
to
how
to
live
more
specifically
it
is
not
a
judgment
upon
the
value
of
life
but
a
judgment
that
one
does
not
find
at
hand
the
specific
means
of
making
life
worth
while
as
an
act
to
be
done
it
falls
within
and
assumes
life
as
a
judgment
upon
the
value
of
life
by
definition
it
evades
the
issue
no
one
ever
influenced
a
person
considering
committing
suicide
by
arguments
concerning
the
value
of
life
but
only
by
suggesting
or
supplying
conditions
and
means
which
make
life
worth
living
in
other
words
by
furnishing
stimuli
to
living
however
i
fear
that
all
this
argument
may
only
obscure
a
point
obvious
without
argument
namely
that
all
deliberation
upon
what
to
do
is
concerned
with
the
completion
and
determination
of
a
situation
in
some
respect
incomplete
and
so
indeterminate
every
such
situation
is
specific
it
is
not
incomplete
the
incompleteness
is
a
specific
situation
hence
the
situation
sets
limits
to
the
reflective
process
what
is
judged
has
reference
to
it
and
that
which
limits
never
is
judged
in
the
particular
situation
in
which
it
is
limiting
now
we
have
in
ordinary
speech
a
word
which
expresses
the
nature
of
the
conditions
which
limit
the
judgments
of
value
it
is
the
word
invaluable
the
word
does
not
mean
something
of
supreme
value
as
compared
with
other
things
any
more
than
it
means
something
of
zero
value
it
means
something
out
of
the
scope
of
valuation
something
out
of
the
range
of
judgment
whatever
in
the
situation
at
hand
is
not
and
can
not
be
any
part
of
the
of
judgment
and
which
yet
instigates
and
cuts
short
the
judgment
it
means
in
short
that
judgment
at
some
point
runs
against
the
brute
act
of
holding
something
dear
as
its
limit
v
the
statement
that
values
are
determined
in
the
process
of
judgment
of
what
to
do
that
is
in
situations
where
preference
depends
upon
reflection
upon
the
conditions
and
possibilities
of
a
situation
requiring
action
will
be
met
by
the
objection
that
our
practical
deliberations
usually
assume
precedent
specific
values
and
also
a
certain
order
or
grade
among
them
there
is
a
sense
in
which
i
am
not
concerned
to
deny
this
our
deliberate
choices
go
on
in
situations
more
or
less
like
those
in
which
we
have
previously
chosen
when
deliberation
has
reached
a
valuation
and
action
has
confirmed
or
verified
the
conclusion
the
result
remains
situations
overlap
the
which
is
judged
better
than
in
one
situation
is
found
worse
than
in
another
and
so
on
thus
a
certain
order
of
precedence
is
established
and
we
have
to
broaden
the
field
to
cover
the
habitual
order
of
reflective
preferences
in
the
community
to
which
we
belong
the
or
valuables
thus
constituted
present
themselves
as
facts
in
subsequent
situations
moreover
by
the
same
kind
of
operation
the
dominating
objects
of
past
valuations
present
themselves
as
standardized
values
but
we
have
to
note
that
such
are
only
presumptive
their
status
depends
on
one
hand
upon
the
extent
in
which
the
present
situation
is
like
the
past
in
a
progressive
or
rapidly
altering
social
life
the
presumption
of
identical
present
value
is
weakened
and
while
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
avail
one
self
of
the
assistance
in
present
valuations
of
the
valuables
established
in
other
situations
we
have
to
remember
that
habit
operates
to
make
us
overlook
differences
and
presume
identity
where
it
does
not
exist
to
the
misleading
of
judgment
on
the
other
hand
the
contributory
worth
of
past
determinations
of
value
is
dependent
upon
the
extent
in
which
were
critically
made
especially
upon
the
extent
in
which
the
consequences
brought
about
through
acting
upon
them
have
been
carefully
noted
in
other
words
the
presumptive
force
of
a
past
value
in
present
judgment
depends
upon
the
pains
taken
with
its
verification
in
any
case
so
far
as
judgment
takes
place
instead
of
the
reminiscence
of
a
prior
good
operating
as
a
direct
stimulus
to
present
action
all
valuation
is
in
some
degree
a
revaluation
nietzsche
would
probably
not
have
made
so
much
of
a
sensation
but
he
would
have
been
within
the
limits
of
wisdom
if
he
had
confined
himself
to
the
assertion
that
all
judgment
in
the
degree
in
which
it
is
critically
intelligent
is
a
transvaluation
of
prior
values
i
can
not
escape
recognition
that
any
allusion
to
modification
or
transformation
of
an
object
through
judgment
arouses
partisan
suspicion
and
hostility
to
many
it
appears
to
be
a
survival
of
an
idealistic
epistemology
but
i
see
only
three
alternatives
either
there
are
no
practical
judgments
as
judgments
they
are
wholly
illusory
or
the
future
is
bound
to
be
but
a
repetition
of
the
past
or
a
reproduction
of
something
eternally
existent
in
some
transcendent
realm
which
is
the
same
thing
logically
or
the
object
of
a
practical
judgment
is
some
change
some
alteration
to
be
brought
about
in
the
given
the
nature
of
the
change
depending
upon
the
judgment
and
yet
constituting
its
unless
the
epistemological
realist
accepts
one
of
the
two
first
alternatives
he
seems
bound
in
accepting
the
third
to
admit
not
merely
that
practical
judgments
make
a
difference
in
things
as
an
this
he
seems
ready
enough
to
admit
but
that
the
import
and
validity
of
judgments
is
a
matter
of
the
difference
thus
made
one
may
of
course
hold
that
this
is
just
what
marks
the
distinction
of
the
practical
judgment
from
the
scientific
judgment
but
one
who
admits
this
fact
as
respects
a
practical
judgment
can
no
longer
claim
that
it
is
fatal
to
the
very
idea
of
judgment
to
suppose
that
its
proper
object
is
some
difference
to
be
brought
about
in
things
and
that
the
truth
of
the
judgment
is
constituted
by
the
differences
in
consequences
actually
made
and
a
logical
realist
who
takes
seriously
the
notion
that
moral
good
is
a
fulfilment
of
an
organization
or
integration
must
admit
that
any
proposition
about
such
an
object
is
prospective
for
it
is
something
attained
through
action
and
that
the
proposition
is
made
for
the
sake
of
furthering
the
fulfilment
let
one
start
at
this
point
and
carry
back
the
conception
into
a
consideration
of
other
kinds
of
propositions
and
one
will
have
i
think
the
readiest
means
of
apprehending
the
intent
of
the
theory
that
all
propositions
are
but
the
propoundings
of
possible
knowledge
not
knowledge
itself
for
unless
one
marks
off
the
judgment
of
good
from
other
judgment
by
means
of
an
arbitrary
division
of
the
organism
from
the
environment
or
of
the
subjective
from
the
objective
no
ground
for
any
sharp
line
of
division
in
the
will
appear
but
to
obviate
misunderstanding
this
does
not
mean
that
some
psychic
state
or
act
makes
the
difference
in
things
in
the
first
place
the
of
the
judgment
is
a
change
to
be
brought
about
and
in
the
second
place
this
does
not
become
an
until
the
judgment
has
issued
in
act
it
is
the
act
which
makes
the
difference
but
nevertheless
the
act
is
but
the
complete
object
of
judgment
and
the
judgment
is
complete
as
a
judgment
only
in
the
act
the
have
been
asked
notably
by
professor
moore
how
they
sharply
distinguish
between
judgment
or
knowledge
and
act
and
yet
freely
admit
and
insist
that
knowledge
makes
a
difference
in
action
and
hence
in
existence
this
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
and
it
is
a
logical
question
it
is
not
a
query
as
it
seems
to
have
been
considered
as
to
how
the
mental
can
influence
a
physical
thing
like
action
a
variant
of
the
old
question
of
how
the
mind
affects
the
body
on
the
contrary
the
implication
is
that
the
relation
of
knowledge
to
action
becomes
a
problem
of
the
action
of
a
mental
or
logical
entity
upon
a
physical
one
only
when
the
logical
import
of
judgment
has
been
misconceived
the
positive
contention
is
that
the
realm
of
logical
propositions
presents
in
a
realm
of
the
specific
rearrangement
of
things
which
overt
action
presents
in
actuality
hence
the
passage
of
a
proposition
into
action
is
not
a
miracle
but
the
realization
of
its
own
character
its
own
meaning
as
logical
i
do
not
profess
of
course
to
have
shown
that
such
is
the
case
for
propositions
that
is
a
matter
which
i
have
not
discussed
but
in
showing
the
tenability
of
the
hypothesis
that
practical
judgments
are
of
that
nature
i
have
at
least
ruled
out
any
purely
dialectic
proof
that
the
of
knowledge
as
such
forbids
entertaining
the
hypothesis
that
the
import
indirect
if
not
direct
of
all
logical
propositions
is
some
difference
to
be
brought
about
the
road
is
at
least
cleared
for
a
more
unprejudiced
consideration
of
this
hypothesis
on
its
own
merits
sense
perception
as
knowledge
i
mentioned
incidentally
in
the
first
section
that
it
is
conceivable
that
failure
to
give
adequate
consideration
to
practical
judgments
may
have
a
compromising
effect
upon
the
consideration
of
other
types
i
now
intend
to
develop
this
remark
with
regard
to
sense
perception
as
a
form
of
knowledge
the
topic
is
so
bound
up
with
a
multitude
of
perplexing
psychological
and
epistemological
traditions
that
i
have
first
to
make
it
reasonably
clear
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
not
which
i
propose
to
discuss
i
endeavored
in
an
earlier
series
of
papers
to
point
out
that
the
question
of
the
of
sense
perception
is
not
as
such
a
problem
of
the
theory
of
knowledge
at
all
but
simply
a
problem
of
the
occurrence
of
a
certain
material
a
problem
of
causal
conditions
and
consequences
that
is
to
say
the
problem
presented
by
an
image
of
a
bent
stick
or
by
a
dream
or
by
secondary
sensory
qualities
is
properly
a
problem
of
physics
of
conditions
of
occurrence
and
not
of
logic
of
truth
or
falsity
fact
or
fiction
that
the
existence
of
a
red
is
dependent
upon
disturbances
of
a
certain
velocity
of
a
medium
in
connection
with
certain
changes
of
the
organism
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
notion
that
red
is
a
way
of
knowing
in
some
more
or
less
adequate
fashion
some
more
real
object
or
else
of
knowing
itself
the
fact
of
causation
or
functional
dependence
no
more
makes
the
an
appearance
to
the
mind
of
something
more
real
than
itself
or
of
itself
than
it
makes
bubbles
on
the
water
a
real
fish
transferred
by
some
cognitive
distortion
into
a
region
of
appearance
with
a
little
stretching
we
may
use
the
term
appearance
in
either
case
but
the
term
only
means
that
the
red
or
the
is
an
or
conspicuous
thing
from
which
we
infer
something
else
not
so
obvious
this
position
thus
freely
resumed
here
needs
to
be
adequately
guarded
on
all
sides
it
implies
that
the
question
of
the
existence
or
presence
of
the
of
even
a
complex
sense
perception
may
be
treated
as
a
question
of
physics
it
also
implies
that
the
of
a
sense
perception
may
be
treated
as
a
problem
of
physics
but
the
position
is
not
that
the
problems
of
sense
perception
are
thereby
exhausted
there
is
still
on
the
contrary
the
problem
of
the
cognitive
status
of
sense
perception
so
far
from
denying
this
fact
i
mean
rather
to
emphasize
it
in
holding
that
this
knowledge
aspect
is
not
to
be
identified
as
it
has
been
in
both
realistic
and
idealistic
epistemologies
with
the
simple
of
presented
and
with
the
of
a
perceptive
act
it
is
often
stated
for
example
that
primitive
sense
objects
when
they
are
stripped
of
all
inferential
material
can
not
possibly
be
false
but
with
the
implication
that
they
therefore
must
be
true
well
i
meant
to
go
this
statement
one
better
to
state
that
they
are
neither
true
nor
false
that
is
that
the
distinction
of
is
as
irrelevant
and
inapplicable
as
to
any
other
existence
as
it
is
say
to
being
more
than
five
feet
high
or
having
a
low
blood
pressure
this
position
when
taken
leaves
over
the
question
of
sense
perception
as
knowledge
as
capable
of
truth
or
falsity
it
is
this
question
then
which
i
intend
to
discuss
in
this
paper
i
my
first
point
is
that
some
sense
perceptions
at
least
as
matter
of
fact
the
great
bulk
of
them
are
without
any
doubt
forms
of
practical
judgment
or
more
accurately
are
terms
in
practical
judgments
as
propositions
of
what
to
do
when
in
walking
down
a
street
i
see
a
sign
on
the
at
the
corner
i
assuredly
see
a
sign
now
in
ordinary
context
i
do
not
say
always
or
necessarily
this
is
a
sign
of
what
to
do
to
continue
walking
or
to
turn
the
other
term
of
the
proposition
may
not
be
stated
or
it
may
be
it
is
probably
more
often
tacit
of
course
i
have
taken
the
case
of
the
sign
purposely
but
the
case
may
be
extended
the
as
perceived
is
to
a
a
sign
of
something
else
than
a
turn
but
still
a
sign
of
something
to
be
done
to
another
man
it
may
be
a
sign
of
a
possible
support
i
am
anxious
not
to
force
the
scope
of
cases
of
this
class
beyond
what
would
be
accepted
by
an
unbiased
person
but
i
wish
to
point
out
that
certain
features
of
the
perceived
object
as
a
cognitive
term
which
do
not
seem
at
first
sight
to
fall
within
this
conception
of
the
object
as
an
intellectual
sign
of
what
to
do
turn
out
upon
analysis
to
be
covered
by
it
it
may
be
said
for
example
that
our
supposed
pedestrian
perceives
much
besides
that
which
serves
as
evidence
of
the
thing
to
be
done
he
perceives
the
for
example
and
possibly
the
carbons
of
the
arc
and
these
assuredly
do
not
enter
into
the
indication
of
what
to
do
or
how
to
do
it
the
reply
is
threefold
in
the
first
place
it
is
easy
and
usual
to
read
back
into
the
sense
perception
more
than
was
actually
in
it
it
is
easy
to
the
familiar
features
of
the
it
is
practically
impossible
or
at
least
very
unusual
to
recall
what
was
actually
perceived
so
we
read
the
former
into
the
latter
the
is
for
actual
perception
to
limit
itself
to
the
minimum
which
will
serve
as
sign
but
in
the
second
place
since
it
is
never
wholly
so
limited
since
there
is
always
a
surplusage
of
perceived
object
the
fact
stated
in
the
objection
is
admitted
but
it
is
precisely
this
surplusage
which
has
not
status
it
does
not
serve
as
a
sign
but
neither
is
it
or
a
term
in
knowledge
a
child
walking
by
his
father
side
with
no
aim
and
hence
no
reason
for
securing
indications
of
what
to
do
will
probably
see
more
in
his
idle
curiosity
than
his
parent
he
will
have
more
presented
material
but
this
does
not
mean
that
he
is
making
more
propositions
but
only
that
he
is
getting
more
material
for
possible
propositions
it
means
in
short
that
he
is
in
an
aesthetic
attitude
of
realization
rather
than
in
a
cognitive
attitude
but
even
the
most
economical
observer
has
some
aesthetic
surplusage
in
the
third
place
surplusage
is
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
signifying
function
independently
of
the
fact
that
surplusage
may
be
required
to
render
the
sign
specific
action
is
free
its
variation
is
under
control
in
the
degree
in
which
are
present
the
pedestrian
has
probably
the
two
alternatives
in
mind
to
go
straight
on
or
to
turn
the
perceived
object
might
indicate
to
him
another
alternative
to
stop
and
inquire
of
a
and
as
is
obvious
in
a
more
complicated
case
it
is
the
extent
of
the
perceived
object
which
both
multiplies
alternative
ways
of
acting
and
gives
the
grounds
for
selecting
among
them
a
physician
for
example
deliberately
avoids
such
alternatives
as
have
been
postulated
in
our
instance
he
does
not
observe
simply
to
get
an
indication
of
whether
the
man
is
well
or
ill
but
in
order
to
determine
what
to
do
he
extends
his
explorations
over
a
wide
field
much
of
his
perceived
object
field
is
immaterial
to
what
he
finally
does
that
is
does
not
serve
as
sign
but
it
is
all
relevant
to
what
he
is
to
do
sense
perception
as
a
term
in
practical
judgment
include
more
than
the
element
which
finally
serves
as
sign
if
it
did
not
there
would
be
no
perception
but
only
a
direct
stimulus
to
action
the
conclusion
that
such
perceptions
as
we
have
been
considering
are
terms
in
an
inference
is
to
be
carefully
discriminated
from
the
loose
statement
that
sense
perceptions
are
unconscious
inferences
there
is
a
great
difference
between
saying
that
the
perception
of
a
shape
affords
an
indication
for
an
inference
and
saying
that
the
perception
of
shape
is
itself
an
inference
that
definite
shapes
would
not
be
perceived
were
it
not
for
neural
changes
brought
about
in
prior
inferences
is
a
possibility
it
may
be
for
aught
i
know
an
ascertained
fact
such
telescoping
of
a
perceived
object
with
the
object
inferred
from
it
may
be
a
constant
function
but
in
any
case
the
telescoping
is
not
a
matter
of
a
present
inference
going
on
unconsciously
but
is
the
result
of
an
organic
modification
which
has
occurred
in
consequence
of
prior
inferences
in
similar
fashion
to
say
that
to
see
a
table
is
to
get
an
indication
of
something
to
write
on
is
in
no
way
to
say
that
the
perception
of
a
table
is
an
inference
from
sensory
data
to
say
that
certain
earlier
perceived
objects
not
having
as
perceived
the
character
of
a
table
have
now
fused
with
the
results
of
inferences
drawn
from
them
is
not
to
say
that
the
perception
of
the
table
is
now
an
inference
suppose
we
say
that
the
first
perception
was
of
colored
patches
that
we
inferred
from
this
the
possibility
of
reaching
and
touching
and
that
on
performing
these
acts
we
secured
certain
qualities
of
hardness
smoothness
and
that
these
are
now
all
fused
with
the
at
most
this
only
signifies
that
certain
inferred
qualities
have
now
become
consolidated
with
qualities
from
which
they
were
formerly
inferred
and
such
fusion
or
consolidation
is
precisely
as
matter
of
fact
such
fusion
of
qualities
given
and
inferred
is
but
a
matter
of
speaking
what
has
really
happened
is
that
processes
which
formerly
happened
successively
now
happen
simultaneously
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
not
a
fact
of
cognition
but
a
fact
of
the
organic
conditions
of
the
occurrence
of
an
act
of
perception
let
us
apply
the
results
to
the
question
of
sense
illusions
the
bent
reed
in
the
water
comes
naturally
to
mind
purely
physical
considerations
account
for
the
refraction
of
the
light
which
produces
an
optical
image
of
a
bent
stick
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
knowledge
or
with
sense
perception
with
seeing
it
is
simply
and
wholly
a
matter
of
the
properties
of
light
and
a
lens
such
refractions
are
constantly
produced
without
our
noting
them
in
the
past
however
light
refracted
and
unrefracted
has
been
a
constant
stimulus
to
responsive
actions
it
is
a
matter
of
the
native
constitution
of
the
organism
that
light
stimulates
the
eyes
to
follow
and
the
arms
to
reach
and
the
hands
to
clutch
and
handle
as
a
consequence
certain
arrangements
of
reflected
and
refracted
light
have
become
a
sign
to
perform
certain
specific
acts
of
handling
and
touching
as
a
rule
stimuli
and
reactions
occur
in
an
approximately
homogeneous
medium
the
air
the
system
of
signs
or
indexes
of
action
set
up
has
been
based
upon
this
fact
and
accommodated
to
it
a
habit
or
bias
in
favor
of
a
certain
kind
of
inference
has
been
set
up
we
infer
from
a
bent
ray
of
light
that
the
hand
in
touching
the
reflecting
object
will
at
a
certain
point
have
to
change
its
direction
this
habit
is
carried
over
to
a
medium
in
which
the
conclusion
does
not
hold
instead
of
saying
that
light
is
bent
which
it
is
we
that
the
stick
is
bent
we
infer
that
the
hand
could
not
protract
a
straight
course
in
handling
the
object
but
an
expert
fisherman
never
makes
such
an
error
in
spearing
fish
reacting
in
media
of
different
refractive
capacities
he
bases
his
signs
and
inferences
upon
the
conditions
and
results
of
his
media
i
see
no
difference
between
these
cases
and
that
of
a
man
who
can
read
his
own
tongue
he
sees
the
word
pain
and
infers
it
means
a
certain
physical
discomfort
as
matter
of
fact
the
thing
perceived
exists
in
an
unfamiliar
medium
and
signifies
bread
to
the
one
accustomed
to
the
french
language
the
right
inference
occurs
there
is
neither
error
nor
truth
in
the
optical
image
it
just
exists
physically
but
we
take
it
for
something
else
we
behave
to
it
as
if
it
were
something
else
we
it
ii
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
pronounced
tendency
to
regard
the
perceived
object
as
itself
the
object
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
knowledge
instead
of
as
a
term
in
knowledge
of
the
practical
kind
has
two
causes
one
is
the
confirmed
habit
of
neglecting
the
wide
scope
and
import
of
practical
judgments
this
leads
to
overlooking
the
responsive
act
as
the
other
term
indicated
by
the
perception
and
to
taking
the
perceived
object
as
the
whole
of
the
situation
just
by
itself
the
other
cause
is
the
fact
that
because
perceived
objects
are
constantly
employed
as
evidence
of
what
is
to
be
done
or
how
to
do
something
they
themselves
become
the
objects
of
prolonged
and
careful
scrutiny
we
pass
naturally
and
inevitably
from
recognition
to
inference
will
usually
take
care
of
itself
if
the
datum
is
properly
determined
at
the
present
day
a
skilled
physician
will
have
little
difficulty
in
inferring
typhoid
instead
of
malaria
from
certain
symptoms
provided
he
can
make
certain
observations
that
is
secure
certain
data
from
which
to
infer
the
labor
of
intelligence
is
thus
transferred
from
inference
to
the
determination
of
data
the
data
being
determined
however
in
the
interests
of
inference
and
as
parts
of
an
inference
at
this
point
a
significant
complication
enters
in
the
ordinary
assumption
in
the
discussion
of
the
relation
of
perceived
objects
to
knowledge
is
that
the
object
the
real
object
of
knowledge
in
perception
is
the
thing
which
the
qualities
which
are
given
it
is
assumed
that
is
that
the
other
term
of
a
proposition
in
which
a
sense
datum
is
one
term
must
be
the
thing
which
produced
it
since
this
producing
object
does
not
for
the
most
part
appear
in
ordinary
sense
perception
we
have
on
our
hands
perception
as
an
epistemological
problem
the
relation
of
an
appearance
to
some
reality
which
it
somehow
conceals
rather
than
indicates
hence
also
the
difficulties
of
reconciling
scientific
knowledge
in
physics
where
these
causes
are
the
terms
of
the
propositions
with
empirical
or
sense
perception
knowledge
where
they
do
not
even
appear
here
is
where
the
primary
advantage
of
recognizing
that
ordinary
sense
perceptions
are
forms
of
practical
judgment
comes
in
in
practical
judgments
the
other
term
is
as
open
and
aboveboard
as
is
the
sensory
quality
it
is
the
thing
to
be
done
the
response
to
be
selected
to
borrow
an
illustration
of
professor
woodbridge
a
certain
sound
indicates
to
the
mother
that
her
baby
needs
attention
if
she
turns
out
to
be
in
error
it
is
not
because
sound
ought
to
mean
so
many
vibrations
of
the
air
and
as
matter
of
fact
does
even
suggest
air
vibrations
but
because
there
is
wrong
inference
as
to
the
act
to
be
performed
i
imagine
that
if
error
never
occurred
in
inferences
of
this
practical
sort
the
human
race
would
have
gone
on
quite
contented
with
them
however
that
may
be
errors
occur
and
the
endeavor
to
control
inference
as
to
consequences
so
as
to
reduce
their
likelihood
of
error
leads
to
propositions
where
the
of
the
perceived
thing
is
not
something
to
be
done
but
the
cause
which
produced
it
the
mother
finds
her
baby
peacefully
sleeping
and
says
the
baby
did
the
noise
she
investigates
and
decides
a
swinging
door
it
instead
of
inferring
a
consequence
she
infers
a
cause
if
she
had
identified
the
noise
in
the
first
place
she
would
have
concluded
that
the
hinges
needed
oiling
now
where
does
the
argument
stand
the
proper
control
of
inference
in
specific
cases
is
found
to
lie
in
the
proper
identification
of
the
datum
if
the
perception
is
of
a
certain
kind
the
inference
takes
place
as
a
matter
of
course
or
else
inference
can
be
suspended
until
more
adequate
data
are
found
and
thus
error
is
avoided
even
if
truth
be
not
found
furthermore
it
is
discovered
that
the
most
effective
way
of
identifying
datum
and
securing
adequate
data
is
by
inference
to
its
cause
the
mother
stops
short
with
the
baby
and
the
door
as
causes
but
the
same
motives
which
made
her
transfer
her
inference
from
consequences
to
conditions
are
the
motives
which
lead
others
to
inferring
from
sounds
to
vibrations
of
air
hence
our
scientific
propositions
about
sensory
data
they
are
not
as
such
about
things
to
do
but
about
things
which
have
been
done
have
happened
facts
but
they
have
reference
nevertheless
to
inferences
regarding
consequences
to
be
effected
they
are
the
means
of
securing
data
which
will
prevent
errors
which
would
otherwise
occur
and
which
facilitate
an
entirely
new
crop
of
inferences
as
to
possibilities
means
and
ends
of
action
that
scientific
men
should
be
conscious
of
this
reference
or
even
interested
in
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
i
am
talking
about
the
logic
of
propositions
not
about
biography
nor
psychology
if
i
reverted
to
psychology
it
would
be
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
practical
activity
of
some
men
should
not
be
predominantly
directed
into
the
pursuits
connected
with
discovery
the
extent
in
which
they
actually
are
so
directed
depends
upon
social
conditions
iii
we
are
brought
to
a
consideration
of
the
notion
of
primitive
sense
data
it
was
long
customary
to
treat
the
attempt
to
define
true
knowledge
in
terms
derived
from
sense
data
as
a
confusion
of
psychology
or
the
history
of
the
growth
of
knowledge
with
logic
the
theory
of
the
character
of
knowledge
as
knowledge
as
matter
of
fact
there
confusion
but
in
the
opposite
direction
the
attempt
involved
a
confusion
of
logic
with
psychology
that
is
it
treated
a
phase
of
the
technique
of
inference
as
if
it
were
a
natural
history
of
the
growth
of
ideas
and
beliefs
the
chief
source
of
error
in
ordinary
inference
is
an
unrecognized
complexity
of
data
perception
which
is
not
experimentally
controlled
fails
to
present
sufficiently
wide
data
to
secure
differentia
of
possible
inferences
and
it
fails
to
present
even
in
what
is
given
lines
of
cleavage
which
are
important
for
proper
inference
this
is
only
an
elaborate
way
of
saying
what
scientific
inquiry
has
made
clear
that
for
purposes
of
inference
as
to
conditions
of
production
of
what
is
present
sense
perception
is
too
narrow
too
confused
too
vivid
as
to
some
and
too
blurred
as
to
some
others
let
us
confine
our
attention
for
the
moment
to
confusion
it
has
often
been
pointed
out
that
sense
qualities
being
just
what
they
are
it
is
illegitimate
to
introduce
such
notions
as
obscurity
or
confusion
into
them
a
slightly
illuminated
color
is
just
as
irretrievably
what
it
is
as
clearly
itself
as
an
object
in
the
broad
glare
of
noonday
but
the
case
stands
otherwise
when
the
is
taken
as
a
datum
for
inference
it
is
not
so
easy
to
identify
a
perceived
object
purposes
of
in
the
dusk
as
in
bright
light
from
the
standpoint
of
an
inference
to
be
effected
the
confusion
is
the
same
as
an
unjustifiable
simplification
this
has
the
effect
of
making
the
as
a
term
of
inference
ambiguous
to
infer
from
it
is
to
subject
ourselves
to
the
danger
of
all
fallacies
of
ambiguity
which
are
expounded
in
the
textbooks
the
remedy
is
clearly
the
resolution
by
experimental
means
of
what
seems
to
be
a
simple
datum
into
its
elements
this
is
a
case
of
analysis
it
differs
from
other
modes
of
analysis
only
in
the
upon
which
it
is
directed
something
which
had
been
previously
accepted
as
a
simple
whole
the
result
of
this
analysis
is
the
existence
as
objects
of
perception
of
isolated
qualities
like
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
scientifically
determined
the
tones
of
the
scale
in
all
their
varying
intensities
in
short
the
sensations
or
sense
qualities
of
contemporary
psychology
textbooks
or
the
simple
ideas
of
sensation
of
locke
or
the
objects
of
sense
of
russell
they
are
the
material
of
sense
perception
discriminated
for
the
purpose
of
better
inferences
note
that
these
simple
data
or
elements
are
not
original
psychologically
or
historically
they
are
primitives
that
is
irreducible
for
purposes
of
inference
they
are
simply
the
most
unambiguous
and
best
defined
objects
of
perception
which
can
be
secured
to
serve
as
they
are
experimentally
determined
with
great
art
precisely
because
the
naturally
given
the
customary
objects
in
perception
have
been
ambiguous
or
confused
terms
in
inference
hence
they
are
replaced
through
experimental
means
involving
the
use
of
wide
scientific
knowledge
deductively
employed
by
simpler
sense
objects
stated
in
current
phraseology
sensations
qualities
present
to
sense
are
not
the
elements
out
of
which
perceptions
are
composed
constituted
or
constructed
they
are
the
finest
most
carefully
discriminated
objects
of
perception
we
do
not
first
perceive
a
single
thoroughly
defined
shade
a
tint
and
hue
of
red
its
perception
is
the
last
refinement
of
observation
such
things
are
the
limits
of
perception
but
they
are
final
not
initial
limits
they
are
what
is
perceived
to
be
given
under
the
most
favorable
possible
conditions
conditions
moreover
which
do
not
present
themselves
accidentally
but
which
have
to
be
intentionally
and
experimentally
established
and
detection
of
which
exacts
the
use
of
a
vast
body
of
scientific
propositions
i
hope
it
is
now
evident
what
was
meant
by
saying
that
current
logic
presents
us
not
with
a
confusion
of
psychology
with
logic
but
with
a
wholesale
mistaking
of
logical
determinations
for
facts
of
psychology
the
confusion
was
begun
by
locke
or
rather
made
completely
current
through
the
enormous
influence
exercised
by
locke
and
some
reference
to
locke
may
be
of
aid
in
clearing
up
the
point
locke
conception
of
knowledge
was
logical
not
psychological
he
meant
by
knowledge
thoroughly
justified
beliefs
or
propositions
certainty
and
carefully
distinguished
it
from
what
passed
current
as
knowledge
at
a
given
time
the
latter
he
called
assent
opinion
belief
or
judgment
moreover
his
interest
in
the
latter
was
logical
he
was
after
an
art
of
controlling
the
proper
degree
of
assent
to
be
given
in
matters
of
probability
in
short
his
sole
aim
was
to
determine
certainty
where
certainty
is
possible
and
to
determine
the
due
degree
of
probability
in
the
much
vaster
range
of
cases
where
only
probability
is
attainable
a
natural
history
of
the
growth
of
knowledge
in
the
sense
of
what
happens
to
pass
for
knowledge
was
the
last
of
his
interests
but
he
was
completely
under
the
domination
of
the
ruling
idea
of
his
time
namely
that
is
the
norm
of
truth
now
the
earliest
period
of
human
life
presents
the
work
of
nature
in
its
pure
and
unadulterated
form
the
normal
is
the
original
and
the
original
is
the
normative
nature
is
both
beneficent
and
truthful
in
its
work
it
retains
all
the
properties
of
the
supreme
being
whose
it
is
to
get
the
logical
ultimates
we
have
only
therefore
to
get
back
to
the
natural
primitives
under
the
influence
of
such
deistic
ideas
locke
writes
a
mythology
of
the
history
of
knowledge
starting
from
clear
and
distinct
meanings
each
simple
well
defined
sharply
and
unambiguously
just
what
it
is
on
its
face
without
concealments
and
complications
and
proceeds
by
natural
compoundings
up
to
the
store
of
complex
ideas
and
to
the
perception
of
simple
relations
of
agreement
among
ideas
a
perception
always
certain
if
the
ideas
are
simple
and
always
controllable
in
the
case
of
complex
ideas
if
we
consider
the
simple
ideas
and
their
compoundings
thus
he
established
the
habit
of
taking
logical
discriminations
as
historical
or
psychological
primitives
as
sources
of
beliefs
and
knowledge
instead
of
as
checks
upon
inference
and
as
means
of
knowing
i
hope
reference
to
locke
will
not
make
a
scapegoat
i
should
not
have
mentioned
him
if
it
were
not
that
this
way
of
looking
at
things
found
its
way
over
into
orthodox
psychology
and
then
back
again
into
the
foundations
of
logical
theory
it
may
be
said
to
be
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
school
of
empiricist
logicians
and
what
is
even
more
important
of
the
other
schools
of
logic
whenever
they
are
dealing
with
propositions
of
perception
and
observation
trusting
confidence
in
atomic
propositions
as
psychological
primitives
it
led
to
the
supposition
that
there
is
a
kind
of
or
simple
apprehension
or
sense
acquaintance
implying
no
inference
and
yet
basic
to
inference
note
if
you
please
the
multitude
of
problems
generated
by
thinking
of
whatever
is
present
in
experience
as
sensory
qualities
are
present
as
if
it
were
intrinsically
and
apart
from
the
use
made
of
its
of
knowledge
the
problem
becomes
an
integral
part
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
sense
organs
neurones
and
neuronic
connections
are
certainly
involved
in
the
occurrence
of
a
sense
quality
if
the
occurrence
of
the
latter
is
in
and
of
itself
a
mode
of
knowledge
it
becomes
a
matter
of
utmost
importance
to
determine
just
how
the
sense
organs
take
part
in
it
if
one
is
an
idealist
he
responds
with
joy
to
any
intimation
that
the
process
of
apprehension
that
is
speaking
truly
the
physical
conditions
of
the
occurrence
of
the
sensory
datum
transforms
the
stimulus
the
alteration
is
testimony
somehow
to
the
constitutive
nature
of
mind
but
if
he
is
a
realist
he
conceives
himself
under
obligation
to
show
that
the
external
stimulus
is
transmitted
without
any
alteration
and
is
apprehended
just
as
it
is
color
must
be
shown
to
be
simply
after
all
a
compacting
of
vibrations
or
else
the
validity
of
knowledge
is
impugned
recognize
that
knowledge
is
something
the
color
whether
about
its
conditions
or
causes
or
consequences
or
whatever
and
that
we
have
to
identify
color
itself
with
a
mode
of
knowing
and
the
situation
changes
we
know
a
color
when
we
understand
just
as
we
know
a
when
we
understand
more
generally
speaking
the
relation
of
to
consciousness
is
thought
to
be
an
essential
part
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
but
if
the
brain
is
involved
in
knowing
simply
as
part
of
the
mechanism
of
acting
as
the
mechanism
for
partial
and
competing
stimuli
into
a
single
scheme
of
response
as
part
of
the
mechanism
of
actual
experimental
inquiry
there
is
no
miracle
about
the
participation
of
the
brain
in
knowing
one
might
as
well
make
a
problem
of
the
fact
that
it
takes
a
hammer
to
drive
a
nail
and
takes
a
hand
to
hold
the
hammer
as
to
make
a
problem
out
of
the
fact
that
it
also
requires
a
physical
structure
to
discover
and
to
adapt
the
particular
acts
of
holding
and
striking
which
are
needed
the
propositions
of
physical
science
are
not
found
among
the
data
of
apprehension
mathematical
propositions
may
be
disposed
of
by
making
them
purely
a
priori
propositions
about
sense
objects
by
making
them
purely
a
posteriori
but
physical
propositions
such
as
make
up
physics
chemistry
biology
to
say
nothing
of
propositions
of
history
anthropology
and
society
are
neither
one
nor
the
other
i
can
not
state
the
case
better
than
russell
has
stated
it
although
i
am
bound
to
add
the
stating
did
not
arouse
in
russell
any
suspicion
of
the
premises
with
which
he
was
operating
men
of
science
for
the
most
part
are
willing
to
condemn
immediate
data
as
subjective
while
yet
maintaining
the
truth
of
the
physics
inferred
from
those
data
but
such
an
attitude
though
it
may
be
of
justification
obviously
stands
in
need
of
it
and
the
only
justification
possible
must
be
one
which
exhibits
matter
as
a
logical
construction
from
sense
data
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
find
some
way
of
bridging
the
gulf
between
the
world
of
physics
and
the
world
of
sense
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
familiar
with
the
schemes
which
have
played
such
a
part
in
the
history
of
humanity
can
read
this
statement
without
depression
and
if
it
occurred
to
one
that
the
sole
generating
condition
of
two
worlds
is
the
assumption
that
sense
objects
are
modes
of
apprehension
or
knowledge
are
so
intrinsically
and
not
in
the
use
made
of
them
he
might
think
it
a
small
price
to
pay
to
inquire
into
the
standing
of
this
assumption
for
it
was
precisely
the
fact
that
sense
perception
and
physical
science
appeared
historically
in
the
seventeenth
century
as
rival
modes
of
knowing
the
same
world
which
led
to
the
conception
of
sense
objects
as
subjective
since
they
were
so
different
from
the
objects
of
science
unless
sense
and
science
had
both
first
been
thought
of
as
modes
of
knowing
and
then
as
modes
of
knowing
the
same
things
there
would
not
have
been
the
slightest
reason
for
regarding
immediate
data
as
merely
subjective
they
would
have
been
natural
phenomena
like
any
other
that
they
are
phenomena
which
involve
the
interaction
of
an
organism
with
other
things
is
just
an
important
discovery
about
them
as
is
also
a
discovery
about
starch
in
plants
physical
science
is
the
of
the
world
by
their
means
it
is
a
rival
not
of
them
but
of
the
medley
of
prior
dogmas
superstitions
and
chance
opinions
about
the
world
a
medley
which
grew
up
and
nourished
precisely
because
of
absence
of
a
will
to
explore
and
of
a
technique
for
detecting
unambiguous
data
that
russell
who
is
a
professed
realist
can
do
no
better
with
the
problem
once
committed
to
the
notion
that
sense
objects
are
of
themselves
of
knowledge
than
to
hold
that
although
the
world
of
physics
is
not
a
legitimate
inference
from
sense
data
it
is
a
permissible
logical
construction
from
them
permissible
in
that
it
involves
no
logical
inconsistencies
suggests
that
the
pragmatic
difference
between
idealist
and
realist
of
this
type
is
not
very
great
from
necessary
ideal
constructions
to
permissible
logical
constructions
involves
considerable
difference
in
technique
but
no
perceptible
practical
difference
and
the
point
of
this
family
likeness
is
that
both
views
spring
from
regarding
sense
perception
and
science
as
ways
of
knowing
the
same
objects
and
hence
as
rivals
until
some
scheme
of
conciliation
has
been
devised
it
is
but
a
variant
of
this
problem
to
pass
to
what
may
be
called
either
the
predicament
or
the
problem
sense
data
differ
from
individual
to
individual
if
they
are
recognized
to
be
natural
events
this
variation
is
no
more
significant
than
any
change
depending
upon
variation
of
generating
conditions
one
does
not
expect
two
lumps
of
wax
at
different
distances
from
a
hot
body
to
be
affected
exactly
alike
the
upsetting
thing
would
be
if
they
were
neither
does
one
expect
to
react
exactly
as
does
steel
that
organisms
because
of
different
positions
or
different
internal
structures
should
introduce
differences
in
the
phenomena
which
they
respectively
have
a
share
in
producing
is
a
fact
of
the
same
nature
but
make
the
sense
qualities
thus
produced
not
natural
events
which
may
then
be
made
either
objects
of
inquiry
or
means
of
inquiry
into
something
else
but
modes
of
knowing
and
every
such
deviation
marks
a
departure
from
true
knowing
it
constitutes
an
anomaly
taken
the
deviations
are
so
marked
as
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
even
on
the
part
of
a
realist
like
russell
that
they
constitute
a
world
of
private
existences
which
however
may
be
correlated
without
logical
inconsistency
with
other
such
worlds
not
all
realists
are
leibnizian
monadists
as
is
russell
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
the
impression
that
all
come
to
just
this
solution
but
all
who
regard
sense
data
as
apprehensions
have
on
their
hands
in
some
form
the
problem
of
the
seemingly
distorting
action
exercised
by
the
individual
knower
upon
a
public
or
common
thing
known
or
believed
in
iv
i
am
not
trying
to
discuss
or
solve
these
problems
on
the
contrary
i
am
trying
to
show
that
these
problems
exist
only
because
of
the
identification
of
a
datum
determined
with
reference
to
control
of
inference
with
a
as
against
this
assumption
i
point
to
the
following
facts
what
is
actually
given
as
matter
of
empirical
fact
may
be
indefinitely
complicated
and
diffused
as
empirically
existent
perceived
objects
never
constitute
the
whole
scope
of
the
given
they
have
a
context
of
indefinite
extent
in
which
they
are
set
to
control
inference
it
is
necessary
to
analyze
this
complex
situation
to
determine
what
is
data
for
inference
and
what
is
irrelevant
this
analysis
involves
discriminative
resolution
into
more
ultimate
simples
the
resources
of
experimentation
all
sorts
of
microscopic
telescopic
and
registering
apparatus
are
called
in
to
perform
that
analysis
as
a
result
we
differentiate
not
merely
visual
data
from
auditory
a
discrimination
effected
by
experiments
within
the
reach
of
everybody
but
a
vast
multitude
of
visual
and
auditory
data
physics
and
physiology
and
anatomy
all
play
a
part
in
the
analysis
we
even
carry
the
analysis
to
the
point
of
regarding
say
a
color
as
a
object
unreferred
to
any
other
object
we
may
avoid
a
false
inference
by
conceiving
it
not
as
a
quality
of
any
object
but
as
merely
a
product
of
a
nervous
stimulation
and
reaction
instead
of
referring
it
to
a
ribbon
or
piece
of
paper
we
may
refer
it
to
the
organism
but
this
is
only
as
a
part
of
the
technique
of
suspended
inference
we
avoid
some
habitual
inference
in
order
to
make
a
more
careful
inference
thus
we
escape
by
a
straightening
out
of
our
logic
by
avoiding
erecting
a
system
of
logical
distinctions
and
checks
into
a
mythological
natural
history
the
epistemological
problems
we
also
avoid
the
contradiction
which
haunts
every
epistemological
scheme
so
far
propounded
as
matter
of
fact
every
proposition
regarding
what
is
given
to
sensation
or
perception
is
dependent
upon
the
assumption
of
a
vast
amount
of
scientific
knowledge
which
is
the
result
of
a
multitude
of
prior
analyses
verifications
and
inferences
what
a
combination
of
tantalus
and
sisyphus
we
get
when
we
fancy
that
we
have
cleared
the
slate
of
all
these
material
implications
fancy
that
we
have
really
started
with
simple
and
independent
givens
and
then
try
to
show
how
from
these
original
givens
we
can
arrive
at
the
very
knowledge
which
we
have
all
the
time
employed
in
the
discovery
and
fixation
of
the
simple
sense
data
science
as
a
practical
art
no
one
will
deny
that
as
seen
from
one
angle
science
is
a
pursuit
an
enterprise
a
mode
of
practice
it
is
at
least
that
no
matter
how
much
more
or
else
it
is
in
course
of
the
practice
of
knowing
distinctive
practical
judgments
will
then
naturally
be
made
especially
does
this
hold
good
when
an
intellectual
class
is
developed
when
there
is
a
body
of
persons
working
at
knowing
as
another
body
is
working
at
farming
or
engineering
moreover
the
instrumentalities
of
this
inquiring
class
gain
in
importance
for
all
classes
in
the
degree
in
which
it
is
realized
that
success
in
the
conduct
of
the
practice
of
farming
or
engineering
or
medicine
depends
upon
use
of
the
successes
achieved
in
the
business
of
knowing
the
importance
of
the
latter
is
thrown
into
relief
from
another
angle
if
we
consider
the
enterprises
like
diplomacy
politics
and
to
a
considerable
extent
morals
which
do
not
acknowledge
a
thoroughgoing
and
constant
dependence
upon
the
practice
of
science
as
hobbes
was
wont
to
say
the
advantages
of
a
science
of
morals
are
most
obvious
in
the
evils
which
we
suffer
from
its
lack
to
say
that
something
is
to
be
learned
is
to
be
found
out
is
to
be
ascertained
or
proved
or
believed
is
to
say
that
something
is
to
be
done
every
such
proposition
in
the
concrete
is
a
practical
proposition
every
such
proposition
of
inquiry
discovery
and
testing
will
have
then
the
traits
assigned
to
the
class
of
practical
propositions
they
imply
an
incomplete
situation
going
forward
to
completion
and
the
proposition
as
a
specific
organ
of
carrying
on
the
movement
i
have
not
the
intention
of
dwelling
at
length
upon
this
theme
i
wish
to
raise
in
as
definite
and
emphatic
a
way
as
possible
a
certain
question
suppose
that
the
propositions
arising
within
the
of
knowing
and
functioning
as
agencies
in
its
conduct
could
be
shown
to
present
all
the
distinctions
and
relations
characteristic
of
the
of
logic
what
would
be
the
conclusion
to
an
unbiased
mind
the
question
probably
answers
itself
all
purely
logical
terms
and
propositions
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
class
of
propositions
of
inquiry
as
a
special
form
of
propositions
of
practice
my
further
remarks
are
not
aimed
at
that
the
case
accords
with
the
hypothesis
propounded
but
are
intended
to
procure
hospitality
for
the
hypothesis
if
thinking
is
the
art
by
which
knowledge
is
practiced
then
the
materials
with
which
thinking
deals
may
be
supposed
by
analogy
with
the
other
arts
to
take
on
in
consequence
special
shapes
the
man
who
is
making
a
boat
will
give
wood
a
form
which
it
did
not
have
in
order
that
it
may
serve
the
purposes
to
which
it
is
to
be
put
thinking
may
then
be
supposed
to
give
its
material
the
form
which
will
make
it
amenable
to
its
purpose
attaining
knowledge
or
as
it
is
ordinarily
put
going
from
the
unknown
to
the
known
that
physical
analysis
and
synthesis
are
included
in
the
processes
of
investigation
of
natural
objects
makes
them
a
part
of
the
practice
of
knowing
and
it
makes
any
general
traits
which
result
in
consequence
of
such
treatment
characters
of
as
they
are
involved
in
that
is
to
say
if
there
are
any
features
which
natural
existences
assume
in
order
that
inference
may
be
more
fertile
and
more
safe
than
it
would
otherwise
be
those
features
correspond
to
the
special
traits
which
would
be
given
to
wood
in
process
of
constructing
a
boat
they
are
manufactured
without
being
any
worse
because
of
it
the
question
which
i
raised
in
the
last
paragraph
may
then
be
restated
in
this
fashion
are
there
such
features
if
there
are
are
they
like
those
characters
which
books
on
logic
talk
about
comparison
with
language
may
help
us
language
i
confine
myself
for
convenience
to
spoken
language
consists
of
sounds
but
it
does
not
consist
simply
of
those
sounds
which
issue
from
the
human
organs
prior
to
the
attempt
to
communicate
it
has
been
said
that
an
american
baby
before
talking
makes
almost
every
sound
found
in
any
language
but
elimination
takes
place
and
so
does
intensification
certain
sounds
originally
slurred
over
are
made
prominent
the
baby
has
to
work
for
them
and
the
work
is
one
which
he
neither
undertakes
nor
accomplishes
except
under
the
incitation
of
others
language
is
chiefly
marked
off
however
by
articulation
by
the
arrangement
of
what
is
selected
into
an
orderly
sequence
of
vowels
and
consonants
with
certain
rules
of
stress
etc
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
speech
is
a
manufactured
article
it
consists
of
natural
ebullitions
of
sound
which
have
been
shaped
for
the
sake
of
being
effective
instrumentalities
of
a
purpose
for
the
most
part
the
making
has
gone
on
under
the
stress
of
the
necessities
of
communication
with
little
deliberate
control
works
on
phonetics
dictionaries
grammars
rhetorics
mark
some
participation
of
deliberate
intention
in
the
process
of
manufacture
if
we
bring
written
language
into
the
account
we
should
find
the
conscious
factor
extended
somewhat
but
making
shaping
for
an
end
there
is
whether
with
or
without
conscious
control
now
while
there
is
something
in
the
antecedent
properties
of
sound
which
enters
into
the
determination
of
speech
the
of
speech
is
in
no
way
measured
by
faithfulness
to
these
antecedent
properties
it
is
measured
only
by
its
efficiency
and
economy
in
realizing
the
special
results
for
which
it
is
constructed
written
language
need
not
look
like
sounds
any
more
than
sounds
look
like
objects
it
must
articulate
sounds
but
faithful
representation
is
wholly
a
matter
of
carrying
the
mind
to
the
same
outcome
of
exercising
the
same
function
not
of
resemblance
or
copying
original
structure
what
may
be
made
out
of
anything
one
can
not
at
least
at
present
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
pigs
bristles
but
this
conditioning
relationship
is
very
different
from
one
in
which
the
antecedent
existences
are
a
model
or
prototype
to
which
the
consequent
must
be
servilely
faithful
the
boatmaker
must
take
account
of
the
grain
and
strength
of
his
wood
to
take
account
of
to
reckon
with
is
a
very
different
matter
however
from
repetition
or
literal
loyalty
the
measure
is
found
in
the
consequences
for
which
existences
are
used
i
wish
of
course
to
suggest
that
logical
traits
are
just
features
of
original
existences
as
they
have
been
worked
over
for
use
in
inference
as
the
traits
of
manufactured
articles
are
qualities
of
crude
materials
modified
for
specific
purposes
upon
the
whole
past
theories
have
vibrated
between
treating
logical
traits
as
subjective
something
resident
in
mind
mind
being
thought
of
as
an
immaterial
or
psychical
existence
independent
of
natural
things
and
events
and
ascribing
ontological
to
them
thus
far
in
the
history
of
thought
each
method
has
flourished
awhile
and
then
called
out
a
reaction
to
its
opposite
the
reification
i
use
the
word
here
without
prejudice
of
logical
traits
has
taken
both
an
idealistic
form
because
of
emphasis
upon
their
spiritual
or
ideal
nature
and
stuff
and
a
realistic
one
due
to
emphasis
upon
their
immediate
apprehension
and
givenness
that
mathematics
have
been
from
plato
to
descartes
and
contemporary
analytic
realism
the
great
provocative
of
realistic
idealisms
is
a
familiar
fact
the
hypothesis
here
propounded
is
a
what
has
been
overlooked
is
the
reality
and
importance
of
art
and
its
works
the
tools
and
works
of
art
are
neither
mental
subjective
things
nor
are
they
antecedent
entities
like
crude
or
raw
material
they
are
the
latter
shaped
for
a
purpose
it
is
impossible
to
overstate
their
objectivity
from
the
standpoint
of
their
existence
and
their
efficacy
within
the
operations
in
question
nor
their
objectivity
in
the
sense
of
their
dependence
upon
prior
natural
existences
whose
traits
have
to
be
taken
account
of
or
reckoned
with
by
the
operations
of
art
in
the
case
of
the
art
of
inference
the
art
securely
of
going
from
the
given
to
the
absent
the
dependence
of
mind
upon
inference
the
fact
that
wherever
inference
occurs
we
have
a
conscious
agent
one
who
recognizes
plans
invents
seeks
out
deliberates
anticipates
and
who
reacting
to
anticipations
fears
hates
desires
explains
the
theories
which
because
of
misconception
of
the
nature
of
mind
and
consciousness
have
labeled
logical
distinctions
psychical
and
subjective
in
short
the
theory
shows
why
logical
features
have
been
made
into
ontological
entities
and
into
mental
states
to
elaborate
this
thesis
would
be
to
repeat
what
has
been
said
in
all
the
essays
of
this
volume
i
wish
only
to
call
attention
to
certain
considerations
which
may
focus
other
discussions
upon
this
hypothesis
the
existence
of
inference
is
a
fact
a
fact
as
certain
and
unquestioned
as
the
existence
of
eyes
or
ears
or
the
growth
of
plants
or
the
circulation
of
the
blood
one
observes
it
taking
place
everywhere
where
human
beings
exist
a
student
of
the
history
of
man
finds
that
history
is
composed
of
beliefs
institutions
and
customs
which
are
inexplicable
without
acts
of
inference
this
fact
of
inference
is
as
much
a
datum
a
hard
fact
for
logical
theory
as
any
sensory
quality
whatsoever
it
is
something
men
do
as
they
walk
chew
or
jump
there
is
nothing
a
priori
or
ideological
about
it
it
is
just
a
brute
empirically
observable
event
its
importance
is
almost
as
conspicuous
as
its
existence
every
act
of
human
life
not
springing
from
instinct
or
mechanical
habit
contains
it
most
habits
are
dependent
upon
some
amount
of
it
for
their
formation
as
they
are
dependent
upon
it
for
their
readaptation
to
novel
circumstances
from
the
humblest
act
of
daily
life
to
the
most
intricate
calculations
of
science
and
the
determination
and
execution
of
social
legal
and
political
policies
things
are
used
as
signs
indications
or
evidence
from
which
one
proceeds
to
something
else
not
yet
directly
given
the
act
of
inferring
takes
place
naturally
without
intention
it
is
at
first
something
we
do
not
something
which
we
to
do
we
do
it
as
we
breathe
or
walk
or
gesture
only
after
it
is
done
do
we
notice
it
and
reflect
upon
it
and
the
great
mass
of
men
no
more
reflect
upon
it
after
its
occurrence
than
they
reflect
upon
the
process
of
walking
and
try
to
discover
its
conditions
and
mechanism
that
an
individual
an
animal
organism
a
man
or
a
woman
performs
the
acts
is
to
say
something
capable
of
direct
proof
through
appeal
to
observation
to
say
that
something
called
mind
or
consciousness
does
it
is
itself
to
employ
inference
and
dubious
inference
the
fact
of
inference
is
much
surer
in
other
words
than
that
of
a
particular
inference
such
as
that
to
something
called
reason
or
consciousness
in
connection
with
it
save
as
mind
is
but
another
word
for
the
fact
of
inference
in
which
case
of
course
it
can
not
be
to
as
its
cause
source
or
author
moreover
by
all
principles
of
science
inference
can
not
be
referred
to
mind
or
consciousness
as
its
condition
unless
there
is
proof
of
the
existence
of
that
mind
to
which
it
is
referred
prima
facie
we
are
conscious
or
aware
inference
precisely
as
we
are
of
anything
else
not
by
introspection
of
something
within
the
very
consciousness
which
is
supposed
to
be
its
source
but
by
observation
of
something
taking
place
in
the
world
as
we
are
conscious
of
walking
we
have
walked
after
it
has
been
done
naturally
or
unconsciously
it
may
be
done
consciously
that
is
with
intent
or
on
purpose
but
this
means
that
it
is
done
consciousness
whatever
consciousness
may
be
discovered
to
mean
not
that
it
is
done
consciousness
now
if
other
natural
events
characteristic
only
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
of
highly
organized
beings
are
marked
by
unique
or
by
distinctive
traits
there
is
good
ground
for
the
assumption
that
inference
will
be
so
marked
as
we
do
not
find
the
circulation
of
blood
or
the
stimulation
of
nerves
in
a
stone
and
as
we
expect
as
a
matter
of
course
to
find
peculiar
conditions
qualities
and
consequences
in
the
being
where
such
operations
occur
so
we
do
not
find
the
act
of
inference
in
a
stone
and
we
expect
peculiar
conditions
qualities
and
consequences
in
whatever
beings
perform
the
act
unless
in
other
words
all
the
ordinary
canons
of
inquiry
are
suspended
inference
is
not
an
isolated
nor
a
merely
formal
event
as
against
the
latter
it
has
its
own
distinctive
structure
and
properties
as
against
the
former
it
has
specific
generating
conditions
and
specific
results
possibly
all
this
seems
too
obvious
for
mention
but
there
is
often
a
virtual
conspiracy
in
philosophy
not
to
mention
obvious
things
nor
to
dwell
upon
them
otherwise
remote
speculations
might
be
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
the
point
of
these
commonplaces
resides
in
the
push
they
may
give
anyone
to
engage
in
a
search
for
features
in
the
act
of
the
search
may
perhaps
be
best
initiated
by
noting
the
seeming
inconsistency
between
what
has
been
said
about
inference
as
an
art
and
inference
as
a
natural
unpremeditated
occurrence
the
obvious
function
of
spontaneous
inference
is
to
bring
before
an
agent
absent
considerations
to
which
he
may
respond
as
he
otherwise
responds
to
the
stimulating
force
of
the
given
situation
to
infer
rain
is
to
enable
one
to
behave
as
given
conditions
would
not
otherwise
enable
him
to
conduct
himself
this
instigation
to
behave
toward
the
remote
in
space
or
time
is
the
primary
trait
of
the
inferential
act
descriptively
speaking
the
act
consists
in
taking
up
an
attitude
of
response
to
an
absent
thing
as
if
it
were
present
but
just
because
the
thing
is
absent
the
attitude
taken
may
be
either
irrelevant
and
positively
harmful
or
extremely
pertinent
and
advantageous
we
may
infer
rain
when
rain
is
not
going
to
happen
and
acting
upon
the
inference
be
worse
off
than
if
there
had
been
no
inference
or
we
may
make
preparations
which
we
would
not
otherwise
have
made
the
rain
may
come
and
the
inference
save
our
lives
as
the
ark
saved
noah
inference
brings
in
short
truth
and
falsity
into
the
world
just
as
definitely
as
the
circulation
of
the
blood
brings
its
distinctive
consequences
both
advantages
and
liabilities
into
the
world
or
as
the
existence
of
banking
brings
with
it
consequences
of
business
extension
and
of
bankruptcy
not
previously
existent
if
the
reader
objects
to
the
introduction
of
the
terms
truth
and
falsity
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
leave
the
choice
of
words
to
him
provided
the
fact
is
recognized
that
through
inference
men
are
capable
of
a
kind
of
success
and
exposed
to
a
kind
of
failure
not
otherwise
possible
dependent
upon
the
fact
that
inference
takes
absent
things
as
being
in
a
certain
real
continuum
with
present
things
so
that
our
attitude
toward
the
latter
is
bound
up
with
our
reaction
to
the
former
as
parts
of
the
same
situation
and
in
any
event
i
wish
to
protest
against
a
possible
objection
to
the
introduction
of
the
terms
false
and
true
it
may
be
said
that
inference
is
not
responsible
for
the
occurrence
of
errors
and
truths
because
these
accompany
simple
apprehensions
where
there
is
no
inference
as
when
i
see
a
snake
which
is
there
or
any
other
case
which
may
appear
to
the
objector
to
afford
an
illustration
of
his
point
the
objection
illustrates
my
point
to
affirm
a
snake
is
to
affirm
potentialities
going
beyond
what
is
actually
given
it
says
that
what
is
given
is
to
do
something
the
doing
characteristic
of
a
snake
so
that
we
are
to
react
to
the
given
as
to
a
snake
or
if
we
take
the
case
of
a
face
in
the
cloud
recognized
as
a
phantasy
then
to
say
nothing
of
in
the
cloud
which
involves
reference
beyond
the
given
phantasy
dream
equally
means
a
reference
to
objects
and
considerations
given
as
the
actual
datum
is
given
we
have
not
got
very
far
with
our
question
of
distinctive
unique
traits
called
into
existence
by
inference
but
we
have
got
far
enough
to
have
light
upon
what
is
called
the
transcendence
of
knowledge
all
inference
is
a
the
assuredly
present
to
an
absent
hence
it
is
a
more
or
less
precarious
journey
it
is
transcending
limits
of
security
of
immediate
response
the
stone
which
reacts
only
to
stimuli
of
the
present
not
of
the
future
can
not
make
the
mistakes
which
a
being
reacting
to
a
future
taken
to
be
connected
with
the
present
is
sure
to
make
but
it
is
important
to
note
just
what
this
transcendence
consists
in
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
transcending
mental
states
to
arrive
at
an
external
object
is
behaving
to
the
given
situation
as
involving
something
not
it
is
robinson
crusoe
going
from
a
seen
foot
to
an
unseen
man
not
from
a
mental
state
to
something
unmental
the
mistakes
and
failures
resulting
from
inference
constitute
the
ground
for
transition
from
natural
spontaneous
performance
to
a
technique
or
deliberate
art
of
inference
there
is
something
humorous
about
the
discussion
of
the
problem
of
error
as
if
it
were
a
rare
or
exceptional
thing
an
anomaly
when
the
barest
glance
at
human
history
shows
that
mistakes
have
been
the
rule
and
that
truth
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
as
to
inferences
bound
up
with
barely
keeping
alive
man
has
had
to
effect
a
considerable
balance
of
good
guesses
over
bad
aside
from
this
somewhat
narrow
field
the
original
appearance
of
inference
upon
the
scene
probably
added
to
the
interest
of
life
rather
than
to
its
efficiency
if
the
classic
definition
of
man
as
a
rational
animal
means
simply
an
inferring
or
guessing
animal
it
applies
to
the
natural
man
for
it
allows
for
the
guesses
being
mostly
wrong
if
it
is
used
with
its
customary
eulogistic
connotations
it
applies
only
to
man
chastened
to
the
use
of
a
hardly
won
and
toilsome
art
if
it
alleges
that
man
has
any
natural
preference
for
a
reasonable
inference
or
that
the
rationality
of
an
inference
is
a
measure
of
its
hold
upon
him
it
is
grotesquely
wrong
to
propagate
this
error
is
to
encourage
man
in
his
most
baleful
illusion
and
to
postpone
the
day
of
an
effective
and
widespread
adoption
of
a
perfected
art
of
knowing
summarily
put
the
waste
and
loss
consequent
upon
the
natural
happening
of
inference
led
man
slowly
and
grudgingly
to
the
adoption
of
safeguards
in
its
performance
in
some
part
the
scope
of
which
is
easily
exaggerated
man
has
come
to
attribute
many
of
the
ills
from
which
he
suffers
to
his
own
premature
inept
and
unguarded
performing
of
inference
instead
of
to
fate
bad
luck
and
accident
in
some
things
and
to
some
extent
in
all
things
he
has
invented
and
perfected
an
art
of
inquiry
a
system
of
checks
and
tests
to
be
used
before
the
conclusion
of
inference
is
categorically
affirmed
its
nature
has
been
considered
in
many
other
places
in
these
pages
but
it
may
prove
instructive
to
restate
it
in
this
context
nothing
is
less
adapted
to
a
successful
accomplishing
of
an
inference
than
the
from
which
it
ordinarily
fares
forth
that
is
a
nest
of
obscurities
and
ambiguities
the
ordinary
warnings
against
trusting
to
imagination
the
bad
name
which
has
come
intellectually
to
attach
to
fancy
are
evidences
that
anything
may
suggest
anything
regarding
most
of
the
important
happenings
in
life
no
inference
has
been
too
extravagant
to
obtain
followers
and
influence
action
because
was
so
variegated
and
complex
that
any
objects
which
it
suggested
had
a
prima
facie
plausibility
that
every
advance
in
knowledge
has
been
effected
by
using
agencies
which
break
up
a
complex
into
independent
variables
from
each
of
which
a
distinct
inference
may
be
drawn
and
by
attacking
each
one
of
these
things
by
every
conceivable
tool
for
further
resolution
so
as
to
make
sure
we
are
dealing
with
something
so
simple
as
to
be
unambiguous
is
the
report
of
the
history
of
science
it
is
sometimes
held
that
knowledge
comes
ultimately
to
a
necessity
of
belief
or
acceptance
which
is
the
equivalent
of
an
incapacity
to
think
otherwise
than
so
and
so
well
even
in
the
case
of
such
an
apparently
simple
thing
as
a
red
this
inability
if
it
is
worth
anything
is
a
residuum
from
experimental
analysis
we
do
not
believe
in
the
thing
as
red
whenever
there
is
a
need
of
scientific
testing
till
we
have
exhausted
all
kinds
of
active
attack
and
find
the
red
still
resisting
and
persisting
ordinarily
we
move
the
head
we
shade
the
eyes
we
turn
the
thing
over
we
take
it
to
a
different
light
the
use
of
lens
prism
or
whatever
device
is
simply
carrying
farther
the
use
of
like
methods
as
of
physical
resolution
whatever
endures
all
these
active
not
mental
attacks
we
accept
pending
invention
of
more
effective
weapons
to
make
sure
that
a
given
fact
just
and
such
a
shade
of
red
is
one
may
say
a
final
triumph
of
scientific
method
to
turn
around
and
treat
it
as
something
naturally
or
psychologically
given
is
a
monstrous
superstition
when
assured
such
a
simple
datum
is
for
the
sake
of
guarding
the
act
of
inference
color
may
mean
a
lot
of
things
any
red
may
mean
a
lot
of
things
such
things
are
ambiguous
they
afford
unreliable
evidence
or
signs
to
get
the
color
down
to
the
last
touch
of
possible
discrimination
is
to
limit
its
range
of
testimony
ideally
it
is
to
secure
a
voice
which
says
but
one
thing
and
says
that
unmistakably
its
simplicity
is
not
identical
with
isolation
but
with
relationship
thus
the
hard
facts
the
brute
data
the
simple
qualities
or
ideas
the
sense
elements
of
traditional
and
of
contemporary
logic
get
placed
and
identified
within
the
art
of
controlling
inference
the
allied
terms
sensory
truths
simple
apprehensions
have
their
meanings
unambiguously
determined
in
this
same
context
while
apart
from
it
they
are
the
source
of
all
kinds
of
error
they
are
no
longer
notions
to
conjure
with
they
express
the
last
results
attainable
by
present
physical
methods
of
discriminative
analysis
employed
in
the
search
for
dependable
data
for
inference
improve
the
physical
means
of
experimentation
improve
the
microscope
or
the
registering
apparatus
or
the
chemical
reagent
and
they
may
be
replaced
tomorrow
by
new
simple
apprehensions
of
simple
and
ultimate
data
natural
or
spontaneous
inference
depends
very
largely
upon
the
habits
of
the
individual
in
whom
inferring
takes
place
these
habits
depend
in
turn
very
largely
upon
the
customs
of
the
social
group
in
which
he
has
been
brought
up
an
eclipse
suggests
very
different
things
according
to
the
rites
ceremonies
legends
traditions
of
the
group
to
which
the
spectator
belongs
the
average
layman
in
a
civilized
group
may
have
no
more
personal
science
than
an
australian
bushman
but
the
legends
which
determine
his
reactions
are
different
his
inference
is
better
neither
because
of
superior
intellectual
capacity
nor
because
of
more
careful
personal
methods
of
knowing
but
because
his
instruction
has
been
superior
the
instruction
of
a
scientific
inquirer
in
the
best
scientific
knowledge
of
his
day
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
control
or
art
of
inference
as
is
the
technique
of
observational
analysis
which
he
uses
as
the
bulk
of
prior
ascertainments
increases
the
tendency
is
to
identify
this
stock
of
learning
this
store
of
achieved
truth
with
knowledge
there
is
no
objection
to
this
identification
save
as
it
leads
the
logician
or
epistemologist
to
ignore
that
which
it
knowledge
that
which
gives
it
a
right
to
the
title
and
as
a
consequence
to
fall
into
two
errors
one
overlooking
its
function
in
the
guidance
and
handling
of
future
inferences
the
other
confusing
the
mere
act
of
reference
to
what
is
known
known
so
far
as
it
has
accrued
from
prior
tested
inquiries
with
knowing
to
remind
myself
of
what
is
known
as
to
the
topic
with
which
i
am
dealing
is
an
indispensable
performance
but
to
call
this
reminder
knowing
as
the
presentative
realist
usually
does
is
to
confuse
a
psychological
event
with
a
logical
achievement
it
is
from
misconception
of
this
act
of
reminding
one
self
of
what
is
known
as
a
check
in
some
actual
inquiry
that
arise
most
of
the
fallacies
about
simple
acquaintance
mere
apprehension
the
fallacies
which
eliminate
inquiry
and
inferring
from
knowledge
the
art
of
inference
gives
rise
to
specific
features
characterizing
the
thing
the
natural
man
reacts
to
the
suggested
thing
as
he
would
to
something
present
that
is
he
tends
to
accept
it
uncritically
the
man
called
up
by
the
footprint
on
the
sand
is
just
as
real
a
man
as
the
footprint
is
a
real
footprint
it
is
a
not
the
idea
of
a
man
which
is
indicated
what
a
thing
means
is
another
it
does
mean
a
meaning
the
only
difference
is
that
the
thing
indicated
is
farther
off
or
more
concealed
and
hence
probably
more
mysterious
more
powerful
and
awesome
on
that
account
the
man
indicated
to
crusoe
by
the
footprints
was
like
a
man
of
menacing
powers
seen
at
a
distance
through
a
telescope
things
naturally
inferred
are
accepted
in
other
words
by
the
natural
man
on
altogether
too
realistic
a
basis
for
adequate
control
they
impose
themselves
too
directly
and
irretrievably
there
are
no
alternatives
save
either
acceptance
or
rejection
what
is
needed
for
control
is
some
device
by
which
they
can
be
treated
for
just
what
they
are
namely
objects
which
however
assured
as
objects
of
experiences
are
uncertain
as
to
their
existence
in
connection
with
the
object
from
which
present
inference
sets
out
while
more
careful
inspection
of
the
given
object
to
see
if
it
be
really
a
footprint
how
fresh
may
do
much
for
inference
and
while
forays
into
whatever
else
is
known
may
help
there
is
still
need
for
something
else
we
need
some
method
of
freely
examining
and
handling
the
object
in
its
status
as
an
inferred
object
this
means
some
way
of
detaching
it
as
it
were
from
the
particular
act
of
inference
in
which
it
presents
itself
without
some
such
detachment
crusoe
can
never
get
into
a
free
and
effective
relation
with
the
man
indicated
by
the
footprint
he
can
only
so
to
speak
go
on
repeating
with
continuously
increasing
fright
there
a
man
about
there
a
man
about
the
man
needs
to
be
treated
not
as
man
but
as
something
having
a
merely
inferred
and
hence
potential
status
as
a
meaning
or
thought
or
idea
there
is
a
great
difference
between
meaning
and
meaning
meaning
is
simply
a
function
of
the
situation
this
thing
means
that
thing
meaning
is
this
relationship
a
meaning
is
something
quite
different
it
is
not
a
function
but
a
specific
entity
a
peculiar
thing
namely
the
man
suggested
words
are
the
great
instrument
of
translating
a
relation
of
inference
existing
between
two
things
into
a
new
kind
of
thing
which
can
be
operated
with
on
its
own
account
the
term
of
discourse
or
reflection
is
the
solution
of
the
requirement
for
greater
flexibility
and
liberation
let
me
repeat
crusoe
inquiry
can
play
freely
around
and
about
the
man
inferred
from
the
footprint
only
as
he
can
so
to
say
get
away
from
the
immediate
suggestive
force
of
the
footprint
as
it
originally
stands
the
man
suggested
is
on
the
same
coercive
level
as
the
suggestive
footprint
they
are
related
tied
together
but
a
gesture
a
sound
may
be
used
as
a
for
the
thing
inferred
it
exists
independently
of
the
footprint
and
may
therefore
be
thought
about
and
ideally
experimented
with
irrespective
of
the
footprint
it
at
once
preserves
the
of
the
situation
and
detaches
it
from
the
immediacy
of
the
situation
it
is
a
meaning
an
idea
here
we
have
i
submit
the
explanation
of
notions
forms
essences
terms
subsistences
ideas
meanings
etc
they
are
surrogates
of
the
objects
of
inference
of
such
a
character
that
they
may
be
elaborated
and
manipulated
exactly
as
primary
things
may
be
so
far
as
inference
is
concerned
they
can
be
brought
into
relation
with
one
another
quite
irrespective
of
the
things
which
originally
suggested
them
without
such
free
play
reflective
inquiry
is
mockery
and
control
of
inference
an
impossibility
when
a
speck
of
light
suggests
to
the
astronomer
a
comet
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
either
to
accept
the
inferred
object
as
a
real
one
or
to
reject
it
as
a
mere
fancy
unless
he
could
treat
comet
for
the
time
being
not
as
a
thing
at
all
but
as
a
meaning
a
conception
a
meaning
having
moreover
by
connection
with
other
meanings
implications
meanings
consequent
from
it
unless
a
meaning
is
an
inferred
object
detached
and
fixed
as
a
term
capable
of
independent
development
what
sort
of
a
ghostly
being
is
it
except
on
the
basis
stated
what
is
the
transition
from
the
function
of
meaning
to
meaning
as
an
entity
in
reasoning
and
once
more
unless
there
is
such
a
transition
is
reasoning
possible
cats
have
claws
and
teeth
and
fur
they
do
not
have
implications
no
physical
thing
has
implications
the
cat
has
implications
how
can
this
difference
be
explained
on
the
ground
that
we
can
not
use
the
cat
object
inferred
from
given
indications
in
such
a
way
as
will
test
the
inference
and
make
it
fruitful
helpful
unless
we
can
detach
it
from
its
existential
dependence
upon
the
particular
things
which
suggest
it
we
need
to
know
what
a
cat
would
be
it
were
there
what
other
things
would
also
be
indicated
if
the
cat
is
really
indicated
we
therefore
create
a
object
we
take
something
to
stand
for
the
in
contrast
with
the
cat
as
a
live
thing
a
sound
or
a
visible
mark
is
the
ordinary
mechanism
for
producing
such
a
new
object
whatever
the
physical
means
employed
we
now
have
a
new
object
a
term
a
meaning
a
notion
an
essence
a
form
or
species
according
to
the
terminology
which
may
be
in
vogue
it
is
as
much
a
specific
existence
as
any
sound
or
mark
is
but
it
is
a
mark
which
notes
concentrates
and
records
an
outcome
of
an
inference
which
is
not
yet
accepted
and
affirmed
that
is
to
say
it
designates
an
object
which
is
to
be
reacted
to
as
one
reacts
to
the
given
stimulus
but
which
is
an
object
of
further
examination
and
inquiry
a
medium
of
a
postponed
conclusion
and
of
investigation
continued
till
better
grounds
for
affirming
an
object
making
a
definite
unified
response
are
given

an
object
so
far
as
that
object
is
undergoing
shaping
in
a
directed
act
of
it
may
be
called
a
possible
object
or
a
hypothetical
object
such
objects
do
not
walk
or
bite
or
scratch
but
they
are
nevertheless
actually
present
as
the
vital
agencies
of
reflection
if
we
but
forget
where
they
live
and
operate
within
the
event
of
controlled
inference
we
have
on
our
hands
all
the
mysteries
of
the
double
world
of
existence
and
essence
particular
and
universal
thing
and
idea
ordinary
life
and
science
for
the
world
of
science
especially
of
mathematical
science
is
the
world
of
considerations
which
have
approved
themselves
to
be
effectively
regulative
of
the
operations
of
inference
it
is
easier
to
wash
with
ordinary
water
than
with
h
o
and
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
falling
off
a
building
and
but
h
o
and
are
as
potent
for
the
distinctive
act
of
inference
as
genuine
and
distinctive
an
act
as
washing
the
hands
or
rolling
down
hill
as
ordinary
water
and
falling
are
impotent
scientific
men
can
handle
these
precisely
as
the
blacksmith
handles
his
tools
they
are
not
thoughts
as
they
are
ordinarily
used
not
even
in
the
logical
sense
of
thought
they
are
rather
things
whose
manipulation
as
the
blacksmith
manipulates
his
tools
yield
knowledge
or
methods
of
knowledge
with
a
minimum
of
recourse
to
thinking
and
a
maximum
of
efficiency
when
one
considers
the
importance
of
the
enterprise
of
knowledge
it
is
not
surprising
that
appropriate
tools
have
been
devised
for
carrying
it
on
and
that
these
tools
have
no
prototypes
in
materials
they
are
real
objects
but
they
are
just
the
real
objects
which
they
are
and
not
some
other
objects
theory
and
practice
our
last
paragraphs
have
touched
upon
the
nature
of
science
they
contain
by
way
of
intimation
an
explanation
of
the
distance
which
lies
between
the
things
of
daily
intercourse
and
the
terms
of
science
controlled
inference
is
science
and
science
is
accordingly
a
highly
specialized
industry
it
is
such
a
specialized
mode
of
practice
that
it
does
not
appear
to
be
a
mode
of
practice
at
all
this
high
specialization
is
part
of
the
reason
for
the
current
antithesis
of
theory
and
practice
knowledge
and
conduct
the
other
part
being
the
survival
of
the
ancient
conception
of
knowledge
as
intuitive
and
dialectical
the
conception
which
is
set
forth
in
the
aristotelian
logic
starting
from
the
hypothesis
that
the
art
of
controlled
inference
requires
for
its
efficient
exercise
specially
adapted
entities
it
follows
that
the
various
sciences
are
the
various
forms
which
the
industry
of
controlled
inquiry
assumes
it
follows
that
the
conceptions
and
formulations
of
the
sciences
physical
and
mathematical
concern
things
which
have
been
reshaped
in
view
of
the
exigencies
of
regulated
and
fertile
inference
to
get
things
into
the
estate
where
such
inference
is
practicable
many
qualities
of
the
water
and
air
cats
and
dogs
stones
and
stars
of
daily
intercourse
with
the
world
have
been
dropped
or
depressed
much
that
was
trivial
or
remote
has
been
elevated
and
exaggerated
neither
the
omissions
nor
the
accentuations
are
arbitrary
they
are
purposeful
they
represent
the
changes
in
the
things
of
ordinary
life
which
are
needed
to
safeguard
the
important
business
of
inference
there
is
then
a
great
difference
between
the
entities
of
science
and
the
things
of
daily
life
this
may
be
fully
acknowledged
but
unless
the
admission
is
accompanied
by
an
ignoring
of
the
function
of
inference
it
creates
no
problem
of
conciliation
no
need
of
apologizing
for
either
one
or
the
other
it
generates
no
problem
of
the
real
and
the
apparent
the
real
or
true
objects
of
science
are
those
which
best
fulfil
the
demands
of
secure
and
fertile
inference
to
arrive
at
them
is
such
a
difficult
operation
there
are
so
many
specious
candidates
clamoring
for
the
office
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
when
the
objects
suitable
for
inference
are
constituted
they
tend
to
impose
themselves
as
real
objects
in
comparison
with
which
the
things
of
ordinary
life
are
but
impressions
made
upon
us
according
to
much
modern
thought
or
defective
samples
of
being
according
to
much
of
ancient
thought
but
one
has
only
to
note
that
their
genuinely
characteristic
feature
is
fitness
for
the
aims
of
inference
to
awaken
from
the
nightmare
of
all
such
problems
they
differ
from
the
things
of
the
common
world
of
action
and
association
as
the
means
and
ends
of
one
occupation
differ
from
those
of
another
the
difference
is
not
that
which
exists
between
reality
and
appearance
but
is
that
between
the
of
crude
occupations
and
of
a
highly
specialized
and
difficult
art
upon
the
success
of
which
so
it
is
discovered
the
progress
of
other
occupations
ultimately
depends
the
entities
of
science
are
not
only
the
scientist
they
are
also
him
they
express
that
is
not
only
the
outcome
of
reflective
inquiries
but
express
them
in
the
particular
form
in
which
they
can
enter
most
directly
and
efficiently
into
subsequent
inquiries
the
fact
that
they
are
sustained
within
the
universe
of
inquiry
accounts
for
their
remoteness
from
the
things
of
daily
life
the
latter
being
promptly
precipitated
out
of
suspense
in
such
solutions
that
most
of
the
immediate
qualities
of
things
including
the
secondary
qualities
are
dropped
signifies
that
such
qualities
have
not
turned
out
to
be
fruitful
for
inference
that
mathematical
mechanical
and
primary
distinctions
and
relations
have
come
to
constitute
the
proper
of
science
signifies
that
they
represent
such
qualities
of
original
things
as
are
most
manipular
for
or
assured
and
extensive
inference
consider
what
a
hard
time
the
scientific
man
had
in
getting
away
from
other
qualities
and
how
the
more
immediate
qualities
have
been
pressed
upon
him
from
all
quarters
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
inclines
to
think
of
the
intellectually
useful
properties
as
alone
real
and
to
relegate
all
others
to
a
field
but
his
victory
is
now
sufficiently
achieved
so
that
this
tension
may
well
relax
it
may
be
acknowledged
that
the
difference
between
scientific
entities
and
ordinary
things
is
one
of
function
the
former
being
selected
and
arranged
for
the
successful
conduct
of
inferential
knowings
i
conclude
with
an
attempt
to
show
how
bootless
the
ordinary
antithesis
between
knowledge
or
theory
and
practice
becomes
when
we
recognize
that
it
really
involves
only
a
contrast
between
the
kinds
of
judgments
appropriate
to
ordinary
modes
of
practice
and
those
appropriate
to
the
specialized
industry
of
it
is
not
true
that
to
insist
that
scientific
propositions
fall
within
the
domain
of
practice
is
to
depreciate
them
on
its
face
the
insistence
means
simply
that
all
knowledge
involves
experimentation
with
whatever
appliances
are
suited
to
the
problem
in
hand
of
an
active
and
physical
type
instead
of
this
doctrine
leading
to
a
low
estimate
of
knowledge
the
contrary
is
the
case
this
art
of
experimental
thinking
turns
out
to
give
the
key
to
the
control
and
development
of
other
modes
of
practice
i
have
touched
elsewhere
in
these
essays
upon
the
way
in
which
knowledge
is
the
instrument
of
regulation
of
our
human
undertakings
and
i
have
also
pointed
out
that
intrinsic
increments
of
meaning
accrue
in
consequence
of
thinking
i
wish
here
to
point
how
that
mode
of
practice
which
is
called
theorizing
emancipates
experience
how
it
makes
for
steady
progress
no
matter
how
much
specialized
skill
improves
we
are
restricted
in
the
degree
in
which
our
ends
remain
constant
or
fixed
significant
progress
progress
which
is
more
than
technical
depends
upon
ability
to
foresee
new
and
different
results
and
to
arrange
conditions
for
their
effectuation
science
is
the
instrument
of
increasing
our
technique
in
attaining
results
already
known
and
cherished
more
important
yet
it
is
the
method
of
emancipating
us
from
enslavement
to
customary
ends
the
ends
established
in
the
past
let
me
borrow
from
political
philosophy
a
kind
of
caricature
of
the
facts
as
social
philosophers
used
to
say
that
the
state
came
into
existence
when
individuals
agreed
to
surrender
some
of
their
native
personal
rights
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
advantages
of
and
aid
from
others
who
made
a
like
surrender
so
we
might
say
that
science
began
when
men
gave
up
the
claim
to
form
the
structure
of
knowledge
each
from
himself
as
a
center
and
measure
of
meaning
when
there
was
an
agreement
to
take
an
impersonal
standpoint
modes
of
practice
left
to
their
natural
growth
represent
in
other
words
arrangements
of
objects
which
cluster
about
the
self
and
which
are
closely
tied
down
to
the
habits
of
the
self
science
or
theory
means
a
system
of
objects
detached
from
any
particular
personal
standpoint
and
therefore
available
for
any
and
every
possible
personal
standpoint
even
the
exigencies
of
ordinary
social
life
require
a
slight
amount
of
such
detachment
or
abstraction
i
must
neglect
my
own
peculiar
ends
enough
to
take
some
account
of
my
neighbor
if
i
am
going
to
be
intelligible
to
him
i
must
at
least
find
common
ground
science
systematizes
and
indefinitely
extends
this
principle
it
takes
its
stand
not
with
what
is
common
with
some
particular
neighbor
living
at
this
especial
date
in
this
particular
village
but
with
any
possible
neighbor
in
the
wide
stretches
of
time
and
space
and
it
does
so
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
continually
reshaping
its
peculiar
objects
with
an
eye
single
to
availability
in
inference
the
more
abstract
the
more
impersonal
the
more
impartially
objective
are
objects
the
greater
the
variety
and
scope
of
inference
made
possible
every
street
of
experience
which
is
laid
out
by
science
has
its
tracks
for
transportation
and
every
line
issues
transfer
checks
to
every
other
line
you
and
i
may
keep
running
in
certain
particular
ruts
but
conditions
are
provided
for
somebody
else
to
foresee
or
infer
new
combinations
and
new
results
the
depersonalizing
of
the
things
of
everyday
practice
becomes
the
chief
agency
of
their
repersonalizing
in
new
and
more
fruitful
modes
of
practice
the
paradox
of
theory
and
practice
is
that
theory
is
with
respect
to
all
other
modes
of
practice
the
most
practical
of
all
things
and
the
more
impartial
and
impersonal
it
is
the
more
truly
practical
it
is
and
this
is
the
sole
paradox
but
lest
the
man
of
science
the
man
of
dominantly
reflective
habits
be
puffed
up
with
his
own
conceits
he
must
bear
in
mind
that
practical
application
that
is
experiment
is
a
condition
of
his
own
calling
that
it
is
indispensable
to
the
institution
of
knowledge
or
truth
consequently
in
order
that
he
keep
his
own
balance
it
is
needed
that
his
findings
be
everywhere
applied
the
more
their
application
is
confined
within
his
own
special
calling
the
less
meaning
do
the
conceptions
possess
and
the
more
exposed
they
are
to
error
the
widest
possible
range
of
application
is
the
means
of
the
deepest
verification
as
long
as
the
specialist
hugs
his
own
results
they
are
vague
in
meaning
and
unsafe
in
content
that
individuals
in
every
branch
of
human
endeavor
should
be
experimentalists
engaged
in
testing
the
findings
of
the
theorist
is
the
sole
final
guaranty
for
the
sanity
of
the
theorist
footnotes
method
in
the
analytic
realists
have
shown
a
peculiar
disinclination
to
discuss
the
nature
of
future
consequences
as
terms
of
propositions
they
certainly
are
not
identical
with
the
mental
act
of
referring
to
them
they
are
objective
to
it
do
they
therefore
already
subsist
in
some
realm
of
subsistence
or
is
subsistence
but
a
name
for
the
fact

reference
leaving
the
determination
of
the
meaning
of

dependent
upon
a
determination
of
the
meaning

more
generally
what
is
the
position
of
analytic
realism
about
the
future
supposing
the
question
to
be
that
of
some
molten
state
of
the
earth
in
past
geologic
ages
taken
as
the
complete
of
a
proposition
or
science
the
facts
discovered
can
not
be
regarded
as
causative
of
or
a
mechanism
of
the
appearance
of
life
for
by
definition
they
form
a
closed
system
to
introduce
reference
to
a
future
event
is
to
deny
the
definition
contrariwise
a
statement
of
that
past
condition
of
the
earth
as
a
mechanical
condition
of
the
later
emergence
of
life
means
that
that
past
stage
is
taken
not
merely
as
past
but
as
in
process
of
transition
to
its
future
as
in
process
of
alteration

in
this

stage

the
history
a
purely
geologic
statement
may
be
quite
accurate
in
its
own
universe
of
discourse
and
yet
quite
incomplete
and
hence
inaccurate
in
another
universe
of
discourse

forth
a

of

it
is
perhaps
poor
tactics
on
my
part
to
complicate
this
matter
with
anything
else
but
it
is
evident
that
passions
and
pains
and
pleasures
may
be
used
as
of
something
beyond
themselves
as
may
the
fact
of
being
more
than
five
feet
high
and
so
get
a
representative
or
cognitive
status
is
there
not
also
a
prima
facie
presumption
that
all
sensory
qualities
are
of
themselves
bare
existences
or
occurrences
without
cognitive
pretension
and
that
they
acquire
the
latter
status
as
signs
or
evidence
of
something
else
epistemological
idealists
or
realists
who
admit
the
character
of
pleasure
and
pain
would
seem
to
be
under
special
obligations
carefully
to
consider
the
thesis
of
the
nature
of
all
sensory
qualities
except
as
they
are
employed
as
indications
or
indexes
of
some
other
thing
this
recognition
frees
logic
from
the
epistemological
discussion
of
secondary
qualities
to
readers
who
have
grasped
the
thought
of
my
argument
it
may
not
be
meaningless
to
say
that
the
typical
idealistic
fallacy
is
to
import
into
the
direct
experience
the
results
of
the
intellectual
or
reflective
examination
while
that
of
realism
is
to
treat
the
reflective
operation
as
dealing
with
precisely
the
same
as
the
original
act
was
concerned
with
taking
the
good
of
reason
and
the
good
of
immediate
behavior
to
be
the
same
sort
of
things
and
both
fallacies
will
result
from
any
assimilation
of
two
different
acts
to
one
another
through
giving
them
both
the
title
knowledge
and
hence
treating
the
difference
between
them
as
simply
the
difference
between
a
direct
apprehension
and
a
mediated
one
analytic
realism
ought
to
be
favorable
to
such
a
hedonism
the
fact
that
analytic
realists
are
not
favorable
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
have
not
taken
their
logic
seriously
enough
but
have
been
restrained
by
practical
motives
from
applying
it
thoroughly
to
say
that
the
moral
life
presents
a
high
degree
of
organization
and
integration
is
to
say
something
which
is
true
but
is
also
to
say
something
which
by
the
analytic
logic
calls
for
its
resolution
into
ultimate
and
independent
simples
unless
they
accept
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
bentham
as
such
ultimates
they
are
bound
to
present
acceptable
substitutes
but
here
they
tend
to
shift
their
logic
and
to
make
the
fulfilment
of
some
variously
defined
the
standard
good
consistency
would
then
admit
the
hypothesis
that
in
cases
an
eventual
organization
rather
than
antecedent
simples
supply
the
standard
of
knowledge
meanwhile
the
term
fulfilment
or
any
similar
term
stands
as
an
acknowledgment
that
the
organization
in
question
is
not
something
ontologically
prior
but
is
one
yet
to
be
achieved
it
must
not
be
overlooked
that
a
mere
reminder
of
an
end
previously
settled
upon
may
operate
as
a
sufficient
stimulus
to
action
it
is
probably
this
act
of
calling
the
end
to
mind
which
the
realist
confuses
with
knowledge
and
therefore
terms
apprehension
but
there
is
nothing
cognitive
about
it
any
more
than
there
is
in
pressing
a
button
to
give
the
signal
for
an
act
already
decided
upon
upholders
of
this
view
generally
disguise
the
assumption
of
repetition
by
the
notion
that
what
is
judged
is
progress
in
the
direction
of
approximation
to
an
eternal
value
but
as
matter
of
fact
progress
is
never
judged
as
i
have
had
repeated
occasion
to
point
out
by
reference
to
a
transcendent
eternal
value
but
in
reference
to
the
success
of
the
in
meeting
the
needs
and
conditions
of
the
specific
situation
a
surrender
of
the
doctrine
in
favor
of
the
one
set
forth
in
the
text
logically
the
notion
of
progress
as
approximation
has
no
place
the
thesis
should
read
that
we
always
try
to
repeat
a
given
value
but
always
fail
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
constant
failure
is
a
queer
name
for
progress
see

use
the
term
image
in
the
sense
of
optics
not
of
psychology
that
something
of
the
cognitive
something
of
the
sign
or
term
function
enters
in
as
a
catalyzer
so
to
speak
in
even
the
most
aesthetic
experiences
seems
to
be
altogether
probable
but
that
question
it
is
not
necessary
to
raise
here
the
superstition
that
whatever
influences
the
action
of
a
conscious
being
must
be
an
unconscious
sensation
or
perception
if
it
is
not
a
conscious
one
should
be
summarily
dismissed
we
are
active
beings
from
the
start
and
are
naturally
wholly
apart
from
consciousness
engaged
in
redirecting
our
action
in
response
to
changes
in
our
surroundings
possibilities
and
hence
an
indeterminate
situation
change
direct
response
into
a
response
mediated
by
a
perception
as
a
sign
of
possibilities
that
is
a

stimulus

quality
