chapter
babcock
and
selma
white
were
among
the
last
of
the
wedding
guests
to
take
their
departure
it
was
a
brilliant
september
night
with
a
touch
of
autumn
vigor
in
the
atmosphere
which
had
not
been
without
its
effect
on
the
company
who
had
driven
off
in
gay
spirits
most
of
them
in
or
other
vehicles
capable
of
carrying
a
party
their
songs
and
laughter
floated
back
along
the
winding
country
road
selma
comfortable
in
her
wraps
and
well
tucked
about
with
a
rug
leaned
back
contentedly
in
the
chaise
after
the
goodbyes
had
been
said
to
enjoy
the
glamour
of
the
full
moon
they
were
seven
miles
from
home
and
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
there
neither
festivities
nor
the
undisguised
devotion
of
a
city
young
man
were
common
in
her
life
consideration
she
had
been
used
to
from
a
child
and
she
knew
herself
to
be
tacitly
acknowledged
the
smartest
girl
in
westfield
but
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
she
had
held
aloof
from
manhood
until
now
at
least
no
youth
in
her
neighborhood
had
ever
impressed
her
as
her
equal
neither
did
babcock
so
impress
her
but
he
was
different
from
the
rest
he
was
not
shy
and
unexpressive
he
was
buoyant
and
and
yet
he
seemed
to
appreciate
her
quality
none
the
less
they
had
met
about
a
dozen
times
and
on
the
last
six
of
these
occasions
he
had
come
from
benham
ten
miles
to
her
uncle
farm
obviously
to
visit
her
the
last
two
times
her
aunt
farley
had
made
him
spend
the
night
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
would
drive
her
in
the
farley
chaise
to
clara
morse
wedding
a
drive
is
apt
to
promote
or
kill
the
germs
of
intimacy
and
on
the
way
over
she
had
been
conscious
of
enjoying
herself
scrutiny
of
clara
choice
had
been
to
the
advantage
of
her
own
cavalier
the
bridegroom
had
seemed
to
her
what
her
aunt
farley
would
call
a
young
man
whereas
babcock
had
been
the
life
of
the
affair
she
had
been
teaching
now
in
wilton
for
more
than
a
year
when
shortly
after
her
father
death
she
had
obtained
the
position
of
school
teacher
it
seemed
to
her
that
at
last
the
opportunity
had
come
to
display
her
capabilities
and
at
the
same
time
to
fulfil
her
aspirations
but
the
task
of
grounding
a
class
of
small
children
in
the
rudiments
of
simple
knowledge
had
already
begun
to
pall
and
to
seem
unsatisfying
was
she
to
spend
her
life
in
this
and
if
not
the
next
step
unless
it
were
marriage
was
not
obvious
not
that
she
mistrusted
her
ability
to
shine
in
any
educational
capacity
but
neither
wilton
nor
the
neighboring
westfield
offered
better
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
lack
of
influential
friends
in
the
greater
world
which
was
embodied
for
her
in
benham
benham
was
a
western
city
of
these
united
states
with
an
eastern
exposure
a
growing
bustling
city
according
to
rumor
with
an
eager
population
restless
with
new
ideas
and
stimulating
ambitions
so
at
least
selma
thought
of
it
and
though
boston
and
new
york
and
a
few
other
places
were
accepted
by
her
as
authoritative
she
accepted
them
as
she
accepted
shakespeare
as
a
matter
of
course
and
so
far
removed
from
her
immediate
outlook
as
almost
not
to
count
but
benham
with
its
thousand
inhabitants
and
independent
ways
was
a
fascinating
possibility
once
established
there
the
world
seemed
within
her
grasp
including
boston
might
it
not
be
that
benham
in
that
it
was
newer
was
nearer
to
truth
and
more
truly
american
than
that
famous
city
she
was
not
prepared
to
believe
this
an
absurdity
at
least
the
mental
atmosphere
of
westfield
and
even
of
the
somewhat
less
solemn
wilton
suggested
this
apotheosis
of
the
adjacent
city
to
be
reasonable
westfield
had
stood
for
selma
as
a
society
of
serious
though
simple
souls
since
she
could
first
remember
and
had
been
one
of
them
not
that
she
arrogated
to
her
small
native
town
any
unusual
qualities
of
soul
or
mind
in
distinction
from
most
other
american
communities
but
she
regarded
it
as
inferior
in
point
of
view
to
none
and
typical
of
the
best
national
characteristics
she
had
probably
never
put
into
words
the
reasons
of
her
confidence
but
her
daily
consciousness
was
permeated
with
them
to
be
an
american
meant
to
be
more
keenly
alive
to
the
responsibility
of
life
than
any
other
citizen
of
civilization
and
to
be
an
american
woman
meant
to
be
something
finer
cleverer
stronger
and
purer
than
any
other
daughter
of
eve
under
the
agreeable
but
sobering
influence
of
this
faith
she
had
grown
to
womanhood
and
the
heroic
deeds
of
the
civil
war
had
served
to
intensify
a
belief
the
truth
of
which
she
had
never
heard
questioned
her
mission
in
life
had
promptly
been
recognized
by
her
as
the
development
of
her
soul
along
individual
lines
but
until
the
necessity
for
a
choice
had
arisen
she
had
been
content
to
contemplate
a
little
longer
now
the
world
was
before
her
for
she
was
and
singularly
free
from
ties
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
a
child
her
father
the
physician
of
the
surrounding
country
a
man
of
engaging
energy
with
an
empirical
education
and
a
speculative
habit
of
mind
had
been
the
companion
of
her
girlhood
during
the
last
few
years
since
his
return
from
the
war
an
invalid
from
a
wound
her
care
for
him
had
left
her
time
for
little
else
no
more
was
babcock
in
haste
to
reach
home
and
after
the
preliminary
dash
from
the
door
into
the
glorious
night
he
suffered
the
to
pursue
its
favorite
gait
a
deliberate
jog
he
knew
the
creature
to
be
docile
and
that
he
could
bestow
his
attention
on
his
companion
without
peril
to
her
his
own
pulses
were
bounding
he
was
conscious
of
having
made
the
whirligig
of
time
pass
merrily
for
the
company
by
his
spirits
and
jolly
quips
and
that
in
her
presence
and
he
was
groping
for
an
appropriate
introduction
to
the
avowal
he
had
determined
to
make
he
would
never
have
a
better
opportunity
than
this
and
it
had
been
his
preconceived
intention
to
take
advantage
of
it
if
all
went
well
all
had
gone
well
and
he
was
going
to
try
she
had
been
kind
coming
over
and
had
seemed
to
listen
with
interest
as
he
told
her
about
himself
and
somehow
he
had
felt
less
distant
from
her
he
was
not
sure
what
she
would
say
for
he
realized
that
she
was
above
him
that
was
one
reason
why
he
admired
her
so
she
symbolized
for
him
refinement
poetry
art
the
things
of
the
spirit
things
from
which
in
the
same
whirligig
of
time
he
had
hitherto
been
cut
off
by
the
vicissitudes
of
the
varnish
business
but
the
value
of
which
he
was
not
blind
to
how
proud
he
would
be
of
such
a
wife
how
he
would
strive
and
labor
for
her
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
and
trembled
on
his
lip
as
he
thought
of
the
possibility
what
a
joy
to
be
sitting
side
by
side
with
her
under
this
splendid
moon
he
would
speak
and
know
his
fate
is
it
a
lovely
night
murmured
selma
appreciatively
there
they
go
she
added
indicating
the
disappearance
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
of
the
last
of
the
line
of
vehicles
of
the
rest
of
the
party
whose
songs
had
come
back
fainter
and
fainter
i
do
care
do
you
he
snuggled
toward
her
a
very
little
i
guess
they
wo
think
i
lost
she
said
with
a
low
laugh
what
suppose
your
folks
would
say
if
you
lost
i
mean
if
i
were
to
run
away
with
you
and
did
bring
you
back
there
was
a
nervous
ring
in
the
guffaw
which
concluded
his
question
my
friends
would
miss
me
much
at
least
they
soon
get
over
the
shock
but
i
might
miss
myself
mr
babcock
selma
was
wondering
why
it
was
that
she
rather
liked
being
alone
with
this
man
big
enough
indeed
to
play
the
monster
yet
half
but
a
man
who
had
done
well
in
his
calling
he
must
be
capable
he
could
give
her
a
home
in
benham
and
it
was
plain
that
he
loved
her
i
tell
you
something
he
said
eagerly
ignoring
her
suggestion
i
like
to
run
away
with
you
and
be
married
selma
what
i
like
and
i
guess
you
wo
but
it
the
burning
wish
of
my
heart
that
you
marry
me
some
time
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
i
a
rough
fellow
of
you
selma
but
i
do
well
by
you
i
would
i
able
to
look
after
you
and
you
shall
have
all
you
want
there
a
nice
little
house
building
now
in
benham
say
the
word
and
i
buy
it
for
us
i
crazy
after
you
selma
the
rein
was
dangling
and
babcock
reached
his
left
arm
around
the
waist
of
his
he
had
now
and
again
made
the
same
demonstration
with
others
jauntily
but
this
was
a
different
matter
she
was
not
to
be
treated
like
other
women
she
was
a
goddess
to
him
even
in
his
ardor
and
he
reached
gingerly
selma
did
not
wholly
withdraw
from
the
spread
of
his
trembling
arm
though
this
was
the
first
man
who
had
ever
ventured
to
lay
a
finger
on
her
i
have
to
give
up
my
school
she
said
they
could
get
another
teacher
they
not
one
like
you
you
see
i
clumsy
but
i
crazy
for
you
selma
emboldened
by
the
obvious
feebleness
of
her
opposition
he
broadened
his
clutch
and
drew
her
toward
him
say
you
will
sweetheart
this
time
she
pulled
herself
free
and
sat
up
in
the
chaise
would
you
let
me
do
things
she
asked
after
a
moment
do
things
faltered
babcock
what
could
she
mean
she
had
told
him
on
the
way
over
that
her
mother
had
chosen
her
name
from
a
theatrical
playbill
and
it
passed
through
his
unsophisticated
brain
that
she
might
be
thinking
of
the
stage
yes
do
something
worth
while
be
somebody
i
had
the
idea
i
could
if
i
ever
got
the
chance
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
there
was
a
wrapt
expression
on
her
thin
nervous
face
and
a
glitter
in
her
keen
eyes
which
were
looking
straight
at
the
moon
as
though
they
would
outstare
it
in
brilliancy
you
shall
be
anything
you
like
if
you
only
marry
me
what
is
it
you
wishing
to
be
i
do
know
exactly
it
is
anything
especial
yet
it
the
whole
thing
i
thought
i
might
find
it
in
my
school
but
the
experience
so
far
has
been
satisfying
troublesome
little
brats
no
i
dare
say
the
fault
in
me
if
i
went
to
benham
to
live
it
would
be
different
benham
must
be
interesting
inspiring
there
plenty
of
go
there
you
like
it
and
people
would
think
lots
of
you
i
try
to
make
them
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
judicially
but
with
a
softened
expression
her
profile
in
her
exalted
mood
had
suggested
a
beautiful
but
worried
archangel
her
full
face
seemed
less
this
and
wore
much
of
the
seductive
embarrassment
of
sex
to
babcock
she
seemed
the
most
entrancing
being
he
had
ever
seen
would
you
really
like
to
have
me
come
he
gave
a
hoarse
ejaculation
and
encircling
her
eagerly
with
his
strong
grasp
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
cheek
selma
darling
angel
i
the
happiest
man
alive
you
must
do
that
yet
she
said
protestingly
yes
i
must
i
yours
and
you
mine
mine
are
you
sweetheart
there
no
harm
in
a
kiss
she
had
to
admit
to
herself
that
it
was
not
very
unpleasant
after
all
to
be
held
in
the
embrace
of
a
sturdy
lover
though
she
had
never
intended
that
their
relations
should
reach
this
stage
of
familiarity
so
promptly
she
had
known
of
course
that
girls
were
to
look
for
endearments
from
those
whom
they
promised
to
marry
but
her
person
had
hitherto
been
so
sacred
to
man
and
to
herself
that
it
was
difficult
not
to
shrink
a
little
from
what
was
taking
place
this
then
was
love
and
love
was
of
course
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
world
that
was
one
of
the
truths
which
she
had
accepted
as
she
had
accepted
the
beauty
of
shakespeare
as
something
not
to
be
disputed
yet
remote
he
was
a
big
affectionate
fellow
and
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
kiss
him
so
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
and
their
lips
met
eagerly
forestalling
the
little
peck
which
she
had
intended
she
let
her
head
fall
back
at
his
pressure
on
to
his
shoulder
and
gazed
up
at
the
moon
are
you
happy
selma
he
asked
giving
her
a
fond
firm
squeeze
yes
lewis
she
could
feel
his
frame
throb
with
joy
at
the
situation
as
she
uttered
his
name
we
be
married
right
away
that
if
you
willing
my
business
is
going
and
if
it
keeps
growing
for
the
next
year
as
it
has
for
the
past
two
you
be
rich
presently
when
shall
it
be
selma
you
in
dreadful
haste
well
i
promise
to
give
the
selectmen
notice
that
they
must
find
another
teacher
because
the
one
they
have
now
is
going
to
become
lewis
babcock
i
the
luckiest
fellow
hooray
in
creation
see
here
he
added
taking
her
hand
i
guess
a
ring
would
look
badly
there
a
real
diamond
too
pretty
little
fingers
she
sighed
gently
by
way
of
response
it
was
comfortable
nestling
in
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
and
a
new
delightful
experience
to
be
hectored
with
sweetness
in
this
way
how
round
and
bountiful
the
moon
looked
she
was
tired
of
her
present
life
what
was
coming
would
be
better
her
opportunity
was
at
hand
to
show
the
world
what
she
was
made
of
a
real
diamond
and
large
at
that
he
repeated
gazing
down
at
her
and
then
as
though
the
far
away
expression
in
her
eyes
suggested
kinship
with
the
unseen
and
the
eternal
he
said
admiringly
but
humbly
it
must
be
grand
to
be
clever
like
you
selma
i
no
good
at
that
but
if
loving
you
will
make
up
for
it
i
go
far
little
woman
what
i
know
of
that
i
like
and
and
if
some
day
i
can
make
you
proud
of
me
so
much
the
better
said
selma
proud
of
you
you
are
an
angel
and
you
know
it
she
closed
her
eyes
and
sighed
again
even
the
bright
avenues
of
fame
which
her
keen
eyes
had
traversed
through
the
golden
moon
paled
before
this
tribute
from
the
lips
of
real
flesh
and
blood
what
woman
can
withstand
the
fascination
of
a
lover
faith
that
she
is
an
angel
if
a
man
is
fool
enough
to
believe
it
why
undeceive
him
and
if
he
is
so
sure
of
it
may
it
even
not
be
so
selma
was
content
to
have
it
so
especially
as
the
assertion
did
not
jar
with
her
own
prepossessions
and
thus
they
rode
home
in
the
summer
night
in
the
mutual
contentment
of
a
betrothal
chapter
ii
the
match
was
thoroughly
agreeable
to
farley
selma
aunt
and
nearest
relation
who
with
her
husband
presided
over
a
flourishing
poultry
farm
in
wilton
she
was
an
friendly
spirit
with
a
sharp
but
not
wide
vision
who
did
not
believe
that
a
likelier
fellow
than
lewis
babcock
would
come
wooing
were
her
niece
to
wait
a
lifetime
he
was
hearty
comical
and
generous
and
was
said
to
be
making
money
fast
in
the
varnish
business
in
short
he
seemed
to
her
an
admirable
young
man
with
a
stock
of
and
high
spirits
eminently
serviceable
for
a
domestic
venture
how
full
of
fun
he
was
to
be
sure
it
did
her
good
to
behold
the
tribute
his
appetite
paid
to
the
buckwheat
cakes
with
cream
and
other
tempting
viands
she
set
before
him
a
pleasing
contrast
to
selma
starveling
diet
and
the
hearty
smack
with
which
he
enforced
his
demands
upon
her
own
cheeks
as
his
apparent
argued
an
affectionate
disposition
burly
was
he
not
the
very
man
to
dispel
her
niece
vagaries
and
turn
the
girl
morbid
cleverness
into
healthy
channels
selma
therefore
found
nothing
but
encouragement
in
her
choice
at
home
so
by
the
end
of
another
three
months
they
were
made
man
and
wife
and
had
moved
into
that
little
house
in
benham
which
had
attracted
eye
benham
as
has
been
indicated
was
in
the
throes
of
bustle
and
before
the
war
it
had
been
essentially
unimportant
but
the
building
of
a
railroad
through
the
town
and
the
discovery
of
oil
wells
in
its
neighborhood
had
transformed
it
in
a
twinkling
into
an
active
and
spirited
centre
selma
new
house
was
on
the
edge
of
the
city
in
the
van
of
real
estate
progress
one
of
a
row
of
small
but
dwellings
over
the
dark
yellow
clapboards
of
which
the
architect
had
let
his
imagination
run
rampant
in
scrolls
and
flourishes
there
was
fancy
colored
glass
in
a
sort
of
over
the
front
door
and
lozenges
of
fancy
glass
here
and
there
in
the
facade
each
house
had
a
little
which
babcock
in
his
case
had
made
appurtenant
to
a
metal
stag
which
seemed
to
him
the
finishing
touch
to
a
cosey
and
ornamental
home
he
had
done
his
best
and
with
all
his
heart
and
the
future
was
before
them
babcock
found
himself
radiant
over
the
first
experiences
of
married
life
it
was
just
what
he
had
hoped
only
better
his
imagination
in
entertaining
an
angel
had
not
been
unduly
literal
and
it
was
a
constant
delight
and
source
of
congratulation
to
him
to
reflect
over
his
pipe
on
the
lounge
after
supper
that
the
charming
piece
of
flesh
and
blood
sewing
or
reading
demurely
close
by
was
the
divinity
of
his
domestic
hearth
there
she
was
to
smile
at
him
when
he
came
home
at
night
and
enable
him
to
forget
the
cares
and
dross
of
the
varnish
business
her
presence
across
the
table
added
a
new
zest
to
every
meal
and
improved
his
appetite
in
marrying
he
had
expected
to
cut
loose
from
his
bachelor
habits
and
he
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
spend
every
evening
alone
with
selma
varied
by
an
occasional
evening
at
the
theatre
and
a
drive
out
to
the
farleys
now
and
then
for
supper
this
with
the
regular
sunday
service
at
rev
henry
glynn
church
rounded
out
the
weeks
to
his
perfect
satisfaction
he
was
conscious
of
feeling
that
the
situation
did
not
admit
of
improvement
for
though
when
he
measured
himself
with
selma
babcock
was
a
cheerful
and
uncritical
optimism
was
the
ruling
characteristic
of
his
temperament
with
health
business
fortune
and
love
all
on
his
side
it
was
natural
to
him
to
regard
his
lot
with
complacency
especially
as
to
all
appearances
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
selma
liked
also
presently
perhaps
there
would
be
a
baby
and
then
their
cup
of
domestic
happiness
would
be
overflowing
babcock
long
ungratified
yearning
for
the
things
of
the
spirit
were
fully
met
by
these
cosey
evenings
which
he
would
have
been
glad
to
continue
to
the
crack
of
doom
to
smoke
and
sprawl
and
read
a
little
and
exchange
was
poetry
enough
for
him
so
contented
was
he
that
his
joy
was
apt
to
find
an
outlet
in
ditties
and
whistling
he
possessed
a
slightly
tuneful
rollicking
knack
at
both
a
proceeding
which
commonly
culminated
in
his
causing
selma
to
sit
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
be
made
much
of
to
the
detriment
of
her
toilette
as
for
the
bride
so
dazing
were
the
circumstances
incident
to
the
double
change
of
matrimony
and
adaptation
to
city
life
that
her
judgment
was
in
suspension
yet
though
she
smiled
and
sewed
demurely
she
was
thinking
the
yellow
clapboarded
house
and
metal
stag
and
a
at
her
beck
and
call
were
gratifying
at
the
outset
and
made
demands
upon
her
energies
selma
position
in
her
father
house
had
been
chiefly
ornamental
and
social
she
had
been
his
companion
and
nurse
had
read
to
him
and
argued
with
him
but
the
mere
household
work
had
been
performed
by
an
elderly
female
relative
who
recognized
that
her
mind
was
bent
on
higher
things
nevertheless
she
had
never
doubted
that
when
the
time
arrived
to
show
her
capacity
as
a
housewife
she
would
be
more
than
equal
to
the
emergency
assuredly
she
would
for
one
of
the
distinguishing
traits
of
american
womanhood
was
the
ability
to
perform
admirably
with
one
own
hand
many
menial
duties
and
yet
be
prepared
to
shine
socially
with
the
best
still
the
experience
was
not
quite
so
easy
as
she
expected
even
harassing
and
mortifying
fortunately
lewis
was
more
particular
about
quantity
than
quality
where
the
table
was
concerned
and
after
all
food
and
domestic
details
were
secondary
considerations
in
a
noble
outlook
it
would
have
suited
her
never
to
be
obliged
to
eat
and
to
be
able
to
leave
the
care
of
the
house
to
the
hired
girl
but
that
being
out
of
the
question
it
became
incumbent
on
her
to
make
those
obligations
as
simple
as
possible
however
the
possession
of
a
new
house
and
gay
fittings
was
an
agreeable
realization
at
home
everything
had
been
upholstered
in
black
and
regard
for
material
appearances
had
been
obscured
for
her
by
the
tension
of
her
introspective
tendencies
lewis
was
very
kind
and
she
had
no
reason
to
reproach
herself
as
yet
for
her
choice
he
had
insisted
that
she
should
provide
herself
with
an
ample
and
more
stylish
wardrobe
and
though
the
invitation
had
interested
her
but
mildly
the
effect
of
and
neatly
fitting
garments
on
her
figure
had
been
a
revelation
like
the
touch
of
a
man
hand
fine
raiment
had
seemed
to
her
hitherto
almost
repellant
but
it
was
obvious
now
that
anything
which
enhanced
her
effectiveness
could
not
be
dismissed
as
valueless
to
arrive
at
definite
conclusions
in
regard
to
her
social
surroundings
was
less
easy
for
selma
benham
in
its
rapid
growth
had
got
beyond
the
level
simplicity
of
westfield
and
wilton
and
was
already
confronted
by
the
stern
realities
which
baffle
the
original
ideal
in
every
american
city
we
like
as
a
nation
to
cherish
the
illusion
that
extremes
of
social
condition
do
not
exist
even
in
our
large
communities
and
that
the
plutocrat
and
the
saleslady
the
learned
professions
and
the
proletariat
associate
on
a
common
basis
of
equal
virtue
intelligence
and
culture
and
yet
although
benham
was
a
comparatively
young
and
an
essentially
american
city
there
were
very
marked
differences
in
all
these
respects
in
its
community
topographically
speaking
the
starting
point
of
benham
was
its
twenty
years
before
the
war
benham
was
merely
a
cluster
of
frame
houses
in
the
valley
of
the
limpid
peaceful
river
nye
at
that
time
the
inhabitants
drank
of
the
nye
taken
at
a
point
below
the
town
for
there
was
a
high
fall
which
would
have
made
the
drawing
of
water
above
less
convenient
this
they
were
doing
when
selma
came
to
benham
although
every
man
hand
had
been
raised
against
the
nye
which
was
the
nearest
and
hence
for
a
community
in
hot
haste
the
most
natural
receptacle
for
dyestuffs
ashes
and
all
the
outflow
from
woollen
mills
pork
factories
and
oil
yards
and
it
ran
the
color
of
glistening
bean
soup
from
time
to
time
as
the
city
grew
the
drawing
point
had
been
made
a
little
lower
where
the
stream
had
regained
a
portion
of
its
limpidity
and
no
one
but
wiseacres
and
busybodies
questioned
its
wholesomeness
benham
at
that
time
was
too
preoccupied
and
too
proud
of
its
increasing
greatness
to
mistrust
its
own
judgment
in
matters
hygienic
artistic
and
educational
there
came
a
day
later
when
the
river
rose
against
the
city
and
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
fever
convinced
a
reluctant
community
that
there
were
some
things
which
americans
did
not
know
intuitively
then
there
were
public
meetings
and
a
general
indignation
movement
and
presently
under
the
guidance
of
competent
experts
lake
mohunk
seven
miles
to
the
north
was
secured
as
a
reservoir
just
to
show
how
the
temper
of
the
times
has
changed
and
how
sophisticated
in
regard
to
hygienic
matters
some
of
the
good
citizens
of
benham
in
these
latter
days
have
become
it
is
worthy
of
mention
that
though
competent
chemists
declare
lake
mohunk
to
be
free
from
contamination
there
are
those
now
who
use
mineral
in
preference
notably
miss
flagg
the
daughter
of
old
joel
flagg
once
the
miller
and
at
the
date
when
the
babcocks
set
up
their
household
gods
one
of
the
oil
magnates
of
benham
he
drank
the
bean
colored
nye
to
the
day
of
his
death
and
died
at
eighty
but
she
carries
a
carboy
of
with
her
personal
baggage
wherever
she
travels
and
is
perpetually
solicitous
in
regard
to
the
presence
of
arsenic
in
into
the
bargain
verily
the
world
has
wagged
apace
in
benham
since
selma
first
looked
out
at
her
metal
stag
and
the
surrounding
landscape
ten
years
later
the
benham
home
beautifying
society
took
in
hand
the
nye
and
those
who
drained
into
it
and
by
means
of
garbage
consumers
disinfectants
and
filters
and
judiciously
arranged
shrubbery
converted
its
channel
and
banks
into
quite
a
respectable
citizens
paradise
but
even
at
that
time
the
industries
on
either
bank
of
the
nye
which
flowed
from
east
to
west
were
forcing
the
retail
shops
and
the
residences
further
and
further
away
to
illustrate
again
from
the
flagg
family
just
before
the
war
joel
flagg
built
a
modest
house
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
southerly
bank
of
the
river
expecting
to
end
his
days
there
and
was
accused
by
contemporary
censors
of
an
intention
to
seclude
himself
in
magnificent
isolation
about
this
time
he
had
yielded
to
the
plea
of
his
family
that
every
other
building
in
the
street
had
been
given
over
to
trade
and
that
they
were
stranded
in
a
social
sahara
of
factories
so
like
the
easy
going
yet
soaring
soul
that
he
was
he
had
moved
out
two
miles
to
what
was
known
as
the
river
drive
where
the
nye
accomplishes
a
broad
sweep
to
the
south
there
an
ambitious
imported
architect
glad
of
such
an
opportunity
to
speculate
in
artistic
effects
had
built
for
him
a
conglomeration
of
a
feudal
castle
and
an
old
colonial
mansion
in
all
the
grisly
bulk
of
signal
failure
considering
our
ideals
it
is
a
wonder
that
no
one
has
provided
a
law
forbidding
the
erection
of
all
the
architecturally
attractive
or
sumptuous
houses
in
one
neighborhood
it
ought
not
to
be
possible
in
a
republic
for
such
a
state
of
affairs
to
exist
as
existed
in
benham
that
is
to
say
all
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
the
city
lay
to
the
west
of
central
avenue
which
was
so
literally
the
dividing
line
that
if
a
benhamite
were
referred
to
as
living
on
that
street
the
conventional
inquiry
would
be
on
which
side
and
if
the
answer
were
on
the
east
the
inquirer
would
be
apt
to
say
oh
with
a
cold
inflection
which
suggested
a
ban
no
benhamite
has
ever
been
able
to
explain
precisely
why
it
should
be
more
creditable
to
live
on
one
side
of
the
same
street
than
on
the
other
but
i
have
been
told
by
clever
women
who
were
good
americans
besides
that
this
is
one
of
the
subtle
truths
which
baffle
the
gods
and
democracies
alike
central
avenue
has
long
ago
been
appropriated
by
the
leading
retail
shops
huge
establishments
where
everything
from
a
set
of
furniture
to
a
can
be
bought
under
a
single
roof
but
at
that
time
it
was
the
social
artery
everything
to
the
west
was
new
and
assertive
then
came
the
shops
and
the
business
centre
and
to
the
east
were
tom
dick
and
harry
michael
isaac
and
pietro
the
army
of
citizens
who
worked
in
the
mills
oil
yards
and
pork
factories
and
to
the
north
across
the
river
on
the
further
side
of
more
manufacturing
establishments
was
poland
a
settlement
of
the
poles
to
reach
whom
now
there
are
seven
bridges
of
iron
there
were
but
two
bridges
then
one
of
wood
and
journeys
across
them
had
not
yet
been
revealed
to
philanthropic
young
women
eager
to
do
good
selma
house
lay
well
to
the
of
central
avenue
far
enough
removed
from
the
river
drive
and
the
flagg
mansion
to
be
humble
and
yet
near
enough
to
be
called
looking
up
their
row
was
complete
and
mainly
occupied
but
the
locality
was
and
in
the
process
of
making
acquaintance
so
many
strangers
had
come
to
benham
that
even
babcock
knew
but
few
of
their
neighbors
without
formulating
definitely
how
it
was
to
happen
selma
had
expected
to
be
received
with
open
arms
into
a
society
eager
to
recognize
her
salient
qualities
but
apparently
at
first
glance
everybody
interest
was
absorbed
by
the
butcher
and
grocer
the
dressmaker
and
the
domestic
hearth
that
is
the
other
people
in
their
row
seemed
to
be
content
to
do
as
they
were
doing
the
husbands
went
to
town
every
day
town
which
lay
in
the
murky
distance
and
their
wives
were
friendly
enough
but
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
either
of
voids
in
their
own
existence
or
of
the
privilege
of
her
society
to
be
sure
they
dressed
well
and
were
suggestive
in
that
but
they
looked
blank
at
some
of
her
inquiries
and
appeared
to
feel
their
days
complete
if
after
the
housework
had
been
done
and
the
battle
fought
with
the
hired
girl
they
were
able
to
visit
the
shopping
district
and
pore
over
fabrics
in
case
they
could
not
buy
them
some
were
evidently
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
they
might
be
so
fortunate
as
to
possess
one
of
the
larger
houses
of
the
district
a
mile
away
and
figure
among
what
they
termed
society
people
there
were
others
who
in
their
satisfaction
with
this
course
of
life
referred
with
a
touch
of
to
the
dwellers
on
the
river
drive
as
deserving
reprobation
on
account
of
a
lack
of
serious
purpose
this
criticism
appealed
to
selma
and
consoled
her
in
a
measure
for
the
half
mortification
with
which
she
had
begun
to
realize
that
she
was
not
of
so
much
account
as
she
had
expected
at
least
that
there
were
people
not
very
far
distant
from
her
block
who
were
different
somehow
from
her
neighbors
and
who
took
part
in
social
proceedings
in
which
she
and
her
husband
were
not
invited
to
participate
manifestly
they
were
unworthy
and
it
was
a
comfort
to
come
to
this
conclusion
even
though
her
immediate
surroundings
including
the
society
of
those
who
had
put
the
taunt
into
her
thoughts
left
her
unsatisfied
some
relief
was
provided
at
last
by
her
church
babcock
was
by
birth
an
episcopalian
though
he
had
been
lax
in
his
interest
during
early
manhood
this
was
one
of
the
matters
which
he
had
expected
marriage
to
correct
and
he
had
taken
up
again
not
merely
with
resignation
but
complacency
the
custom
of
attending
service
regularly
white
had
been
a
controversial
methodist
but
since
his
wife
death
and
especially
since
the
war
he
had
abstained
from
religious
observances
and
had
argued
himself
somewhat
far
afield
from
the
fold
of
orthodox
belief
consequently
selma
though
she
attended
church
at
westfield
when
her
father
ailments
did
not
require
her
presence
at
home
had
been
brought
up
to
exercise
her
faculties
freely
on
problems
of
faith
and
to
feel
herself
a
little
more
enlightened
than
the
conventional
worshipper
still
she
was
not
averse
to
following
her
husband
to
the
rev
henry
glynn
church
the
experience
was
another
revelation
to
her
for
service
at
westfield
had
been
eminently
severe
and
unadorned
glynn
was
an
englishman
a
short
stout
strenuous
member
of
the
church
of
england
with
a
broad
accent
and
a
predilection
for
ritual
but
enthusiastic
and
earnest
he
had
been
tempted
to
cross
the
ocean
by
the
opportunities
for
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
and
he
had
fixed
on
benham
as
a
vineyard
where
he
could
labor
to
advantage
his
advent
had
been
a
success
he
had
awakened
interest
by
his
fervor
and
by
his
methods
the
pew
taken
by
babcock
was
one
of
the
last
remaining
and
there
was
already
talk
of
building
a
larger
church
to
replace
the
chapel
where
he
ministered
choir
boys
elaborate
vestments
and
genuflections
were
novelties
in
the
protestant
worship
of
benham
and
attracted
the
attention
of
many
almost
weary
of
plainer
forms
of
worship
especially
as
these
manifestations
of
color
were
effectively
supplemented
by
evident
sincerity
of
spirit
on
the
part
of
their
pastor
nor
were
his
energy
and
zeal
confined
to
purely
spiritual
functions
the
scope
of
his
church
work
was
practical
and
social
he
had
organized
from
the
congregation
societies
of
various
sorts
to
relieve
the
poor
bible
classes
and
evening
reunions
which
the
members
of
the
parish
were
urged
to
attend
in
order
to
become
acquainted
glynn
manner
was
both
hearty
and
pompous
to
him
there
was
no
church
in
the
world
but
the
church
of
england
and
it
was
obvious
that
as
one
of
the
clergy
of
that
church
he
considered
himself
to
be
no
mean
man
but
apart
from
this
serious
intellectual
foible
with
respect
to
his
own
relative
importance
he
was
a
stimulating
christian
and
citizen
within
his
lights
his
active
crusading
and
emotional
temperament
just
suited
the
seething
propensities
of
benham
his
flock
comprised
a
few
of
the
residents
of
the
river
drive
district
among
them
the
flaggs
but
was
a
fairly
representative
mixture
of
all
grades
of
society
including
the
poorest
these
last
were
specimens
under
spiritual
duress
rather
than
free
worshippers
and
it
was
a
constant
puzzle
to
the
reverend
gentleman
why
in
the
matter
of
attendance
they
metaphorically
speaking
sickened
and
died
it
had
never
been
so
in
england
bonnets
responded
one
day
hallett
taylor
who
had
become
glynn
leading
ally
in
parish
matters
and
was
noted
for
her
executive
ability
she
was
an
engaging
but
soul
who
went
straight
to
the
point
i
do
not
fathom
your
meaning
said
the
pastor
a
little
loftily
for
the
suggestion
sounded
flippant
it
hurts
their
feelings
to
go
to
a
church
where
their
clothes
are
shabby
compared
with
those
of
the
rest
of
the
congregation
yes
but
in
god
chapel
dear
lady
all
such
distinctions
should
be
forgotten
they
ca
forget
and
i
do
blame
them
much
poor
things
do
you
it
the
american
spirit
there
now
glynn
you
were
asking
me
yesterday
to
suggest
some
one
for
junior
warden
why
not
babcock
they
new
comers
and
seem
available
people
glynn
distress
at
her
first
question
was
merged
in
the
interest
inspired
by
her
second
for
his
glance
had
followed
hers
until
it
rested
on
the
babcocks
who
had
just
entered
the
vestry
to
attend
the
social
reunion
selma
face
wore
its
worried
archangel
aspect
she
was
on
her
good
behavior
and
proudly
on
her
guard
against
social
impertinence
but
she
looked
very
pretty
and
her
compact
slight
figure
indicated
a
busy
way
i
will
interrogate
him
he
answered
i
have
observed
them
before
and
and
i
ca
quite
make
out
the
wife
it
is
almost
a
spiritual
face
and
yet
just
a
little
hard
and
keen
broke
in
taylor
upon
his
hesitation
she
is
pretty
and
she
looks
clever
i
think
we
can
get
some
work
out
of
her
thereupon
she
sailed
gracefully
in
the
direction
of
selma
taylor
was
from
maryland
her
husband
a
physician
had
come
to
benham
at
the
close
of
the
war
to
build
up
a
practice
and
his
wife
had
aided
him
by
her
energy
and
graciousness
to
make
friends
unlike
some
southerners
she
was
not
indolent
and
yet
she
possessed
all
the
ingratiating
spontaneous
charm
of
women
from
that
section
of
the
country
her
tastes
were
æsthetic
and
ethical
rather
than
intellectual
and
her
special
interest
at
the
moment
was
the
welfare
of
the
church
she
thought
it
desirable
that
all
the
elements
of
which
the
congregation
was
composed
should
be
represented
on
the
committees
and
selma
seemed
to
her
the
most
obviously
available
person
from
the
class
to
which
the
babcocks
belonged
i
want
you
to
help
us
she
said
i
think
you
have
ideas
we
need
a
woman
with
sense
and
ideas
on
our
committee
to
build
the
new
church
selma
was
not
used
to
easy
grace
and
sprightly
spontaneity
it
affected
her
at
first
much
as
the
touch
of
man
but
just
as
in
that
instance
the
experience
was
agreeable
life
was
too
serious
a
thing
in
her
regard
to
lend
itself
casually
to
lightness
and
yet
she
felt
instinctively
attracted
by
this
lack
of
and
besides
here
was
an
opportunity
such
as
she
had
been
yearning
for
she
had
met
taylor
before
and
knew
her
to
be
the
presiding
genius
of
the
congregation
and
it
was
evident
that
taylor
had
discovered
her
value
thank
you
she
said
gravely
but
cordially
that
is
what
i
should
like
i
wish
to
be
of
use
i
shall
be
pleased
to
serve
on
the
committee
it
will
be
interesting
i
think
i
have
never
helped
build
anything
before
perhaps
you
have
no
said
selma
slowly
her
tone
conveyed
the
impression
that
though
her
abilities
had
never
been
put
to
that
precise
test
the
employment
seemed
easily
within
her
capacity
ah
i
am
sure
you
will
be
suggestive
said
taylor
i
am
right
anxious
that
it
shall
be
a
credit
in
an
architectural
way
you
know
glynn
who
had
followed
with
more
measured
tread
now
mingled
his
hearty
bass
voice
in
the
conversation
his
mental
attitude
was
friendly
but
inquisitorial
as
seemed
to
him
to
befit
one
charged
with
the
cure
of
souls
he
proceeded
to
ask
questions
beginning
with
inquiries
conventional
and
domestic
but
verging
presently
on
points
of
faith
babcock
to
whom
they
were
directly
addressed
stood
the
ordeal
well
revealing
himself
as
flattered
contrite
and
zealous
to
avail
himself
of
the
blessings
of
the
church
he
admitted
that
lately
he
had
been
lax
in
his
spiritual
duties
we
come
every
sunday
now
he
said
buoyantly
with
a
glance
at
selma
as
though
to
indicate
that
she
deserved
the
credit
of
his
reformation
the
holy
sacrament
of
marriage
has
led
many
souls
from
darkness
into
light
from
the
of
egypt
to
the
table
of
the
lord
glynn
answered
and
you
my
daughter
he
added
meaningly
guard
well
your
advantage
it
was
agreeable
to
selma
that
the
clergymen
seemed
to
appreciate
her
superiority
to
her
embarrassed
husband
especially
as
she
thought
she
knew
that
in
england
women
were
not
expected
to
have
opinions
of
their
own
she
wished
to
say
something
to
impress
him
more
distinctly
with
her
cleverness
for
though
she
was
secretly
contemptuous
of
his
ceremonials
there
was
something
impressive
in
his
mandatory
zeal
she
came
near
asking
whether
he
held
to
the
belief
that
it
was
wrong
for
a
man
to
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
which
was
the
only
proposition
in
relation
to
the
married
state
which
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
as
likely
to
show
her
independence
but
she
contented
herself
instead
with
saying
with
so
much
of
taylor
spontaneity
as
she
could
reproduce
without
practice
we
expect
to
be
very
happy
in
your
church
selma
however
supplemented
her
words
with
her
tense
spiritual
look
she
felt
happier
than
she
had
for
weeks
inasmuch
as
life
seemed
to
be
opening
before
her
for
a
few
moments
she
listened
to
glynn
unfold
his
hopes
in
regard
to
the
new
church
trying
to
make
him
feel
that
she
was
no
common
woman
she
considered
it
a
tribute
to
her
when
he
took
lewis
aside
later
and
asked
him
to
become
a
junior
warden
chapter
iii
at
this
time
the
necessity
for
special
knowledge
as
to
artistic
or
educational
matters
was
recognized
grudgingly
in
benham
any
reputable
citizen
was
considered
capable
to
pass
judgment
on
statues
and
pictures
design
a
house
or
public
building
and
prescribe
courses
of
study
for
since
then
the
benhamite
little
by
little
through
wise
legislation
or
public
opinion
born
of
bitter
experience
has
been
robbed
of
these
prerogatives
until
not
long
ago
the
and
undemocratic
proposition
to
take
away
the
laying
out
of
the
new
city
park
from
the
easy
going
but
ignorant
mercies
of
the
city
forester
who
had
been
first
a
plumber
and
later
an
alderman
prevailed
an
enlightened
civic
spirit
triumphed
and
special
knowledge
was
invoked
that
was
years
later
hallett
taylor
had
found
herself
almost
at
the
outset
in
her
purpose
to
build
the
new
church
on
artistic
lines
or
rather
the
case
should
be
stated
thus
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
to
be
the
most
beautiful
church
in
the
country
consistent
with
the
money
and
no
one
doubted
that
it
would
be
especially
as
everyone
except
taylor
felt
that
in
confiding
the
matter
to
the
leading
architect
in
benham
the
committee
would
be
exercising
a
wise
and
intelligent
discretion
pierce
the
individual
suggested
had
never
until
recently
employed
the
word
architect
in
speaking
of
himself
and
he
pronounced
it
as
did
some
of
the
committee
arshitect
shying
a
little
at
the
word
as
though
it
were
caviare
and
anything
but
american
he
was
a
builder
practised
by
a
brief
but
rushing
career
in
erecting
houses
banks
schools
and
warehouses
speedily
and
boldly
he
had
been
on
the
spot
when
the
new
growth
of
benham
began
and
his
handiwork
was
writ
large
all
over
the
city
the
city
was
proud
of
him
and
had
as
it
were
sniffed
when
joel
flagg
went
elsewhere
for
a
man
to
build
his
new
house
surely
if
it
were
necessary
to
pay
extra
for
that
sort
of
thing
was
not
home
talent
good
enough
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
ugly
splendor
of
the
flagg
mediæval
castle
had
so
far
dazed
the
eye
of
benham
that
its
arshitect
had
felt
constrained
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
times
to
try
fancy
flights
of
his
own
he
had
silenced
any
doubting
thomases
by
his
latest
effort
a
new
rich
in
rampant
angles
and
scrolls
on
the
front
of
which
the
name
appeared
in
ambitious
distorted
hieroglyphics
think
what
a
wealth
of
imagery
in
the
tossing
of
the
second
o
on
top
of
the
if
artistic
novelty
and
genius
were
sought
for
the
new
church
here
it
was
ready
to
be
invoked
besides
pierce
was
a
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
committee
and
though
the
committee
had
the
fear
of
god
in
their
hearts
in
the
erection
of
his
sanctuary
it
was
not
easy
to
protest
against
the
near
relative
of
a
fellow
member
especially
one
so
competent
the
committee
numbered
seven
selma
had
been
chosen
to
fill
a
vacancy
caused
by
death
but
at
the
time
of
her
selection
the
matter
was
still
in
embryo
and
the
question
of
an
architect
had
not
been
mooted
at
the
next
meeting
discussion
arose
as
to
whether
pierce
should
be
given
the
job
under
the
eagle
eyes
of
a
or
project
of
inviting
competitive
designs
should
be
adopted
it
was
known
that
glynn
without
meaning
disrespect
to
pierce
favored
the
latter
plan
as
more
progressive
a
word
always
attractive
to
benham
ears
when
they
had
time
to
listen
its
potency
coupled
with
veneration
for
the
pastor
opinion
had
secured
the
vote
of
clyme
a
banker
another
member
of
the
committee
a
lawyer
favored
taylor
idea
because
of
a
grudge
against
pierce
the
chairman
and
and
a
stove
dealer
were
opposed
to
the
competitive
plan
as
highfalutin
and
unnecessary
thus
the
deciding
vote
lay
with
selma
now
that
they
were
on
the
same
committee
taylor
could
not
altogether
make
her
out
she
remembered
that
glynn
had
said
the
same
thing
taylor
was
accustomed
to
conquests
without
actual
premeditation
she
was
agreeably
conscious
of
being
able
to
convert
and
sweep
most
opponents
off
their
feet
by
the
force
of
her
pleasant
personality
in
this
case
the
effect
was
not
so
obvious
she
was
conscious
that
selma
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
upon
her
but
as
to
what
she
was
thinking
taylor
felt
less
certain
clearly
she
was
mesmerized
but
was
the
tribute
admiration
or
hostility
taylor
was
piqued
and
put
upon
her
metal
besides
she
needed
selma
vote
not
being
skilled
in
psychological
analyses
she
had
to
resort
to
practical
methods
and
invited
her
to
afternoon
tea
selma
had
never
been
present
at
afternoon
tea
as
a
domestic
function
in
her
life
nor
had
she
seen
a
home
like
taylor
the
house
was
no
larger
than
her
own
and
had
cost
less
medicine
had
not
been
so
lucrative
as
the
manufacture
of
varnish
externally
the
house
displayed
stern
lines
of
unadorned
brick
the
style
of
benham
in
the
first
throes
of
expansion
before
pierce
imagination
had
been
stirred
taylor
had
bought
it
as
it
stood
and
his
wife
had
made
no
attempt
to
alter
the
outside
which
was
after
all
inoffensively
homely
but
the
interior
was
bewildering
to
selma
gaze
in
its
suggestion
of
cosey
comfort
pretty
tasteful
things
many
of
them
inexpensive
of
foreign
origin
a
small
picture
a
bit
of
china
a
mediæval
relic
were
cleverly
placed
as
a
relief
to
the
conventional
furniture
selma
had
been
used
to
formalism
in
household
garniture
to
a
best
room
little
used
and
precise
with
the
rigor
of
wax
flowers
and
black
and
to
a
living
room
where
the
effect
sought
was
purely
utilitarian
her
new
home
in
spite
of
its
colored
glass
and
iron
stag
was
arranged
in
much
this
fashion
as
were
the
houses
of
her
neighbors
which
she
had
entered
selma
managed
to
seat
herself
on
the
one
chair
in
the
room
from
this
she
was
promptly
driven
by
taylor
and
established
in
one
corner
of
a
lounge
with
a
soft
silk
cushion
behind
her
and
further
propitiated
by
the
proffer
of
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
dainty
cup
and
saucer
all
this
including
taylor
musical
voice
easy
speech
and
ingratiating
friendliness
alternately
thrilled
and
irritated
her
she
would
have
liked
to
discard
her
hostess
from
her
thought
as
a
light
creature
unworthy
of
intellectual
seriousness
but
she
found
herself
fascinated
and
even
thawed
in
spite
of
herself
i
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
really
to
talk
to
you
said
taylor
at
the
church
reunions
one
is
so
liable
to
interruptions
if
i
not
mistaken
you
taught
school
before
you
were
married
for
a
short
time
that
must
have
been
interesting
it
is
so
practical
and
definite
my
life
she
added
deprecatingly
has
been
a
thing
of
threads
and
patches
a
bit
here
and
a
bit
there
she
paused
but
without
forcing
a
response
proceeded
blithely
to
touch
on
her
past
by
way
of
illustration
the
war
had
come
just
when
she
was
grown
up
and
her
kin
in
maryland
were
divided
on
the
issue
her
father
had
taken
his
family
abroad
but
her
heart
was
in
the
keeping
of
a
young
officer
on
the
northern
side
now
her
husband
loss
of
property
and
bitterness
of
spirit
had
kept
her
parents
expatriated
and
she
with
them
had
journeyed
from
place
to
place
in
europe
she
had
seen
many
beautiful
places
and
beautiful
things
at
last
major
taylor
had
come
for
her
and
carried
her
off
as
his
bride
to
take
up
again
her
life
as
an
american
i
am
interested
in
benham
she
continued
and
i
count
on
you
babcock
to
help
make
the
new
church
what
it
ought
to
be
artistically
worthy
of
all
the
energy
and
independence
there
is
in
this
place
selma
eye
kindled
the
allusion
to
foreign
lands
had
aroused
her
distrust
but
this
patriotic
avowal
warmed
her
pulses
every
one
is
so
busy
with
private
affairs
here
owing
to
the
rapid
growth
of
the
city
pursued

that
there
is
danger
of
our
doing
inconsiderately
things
which
can
not
easily
be
set
right
hereafter
an
ugly
or
building
may
be
an
eyesore
for
a
generation
i
know
that
we
have
honest
and
skilful
mechanics
in
benham
but
as
trustees
of
the
church
funds
should
we
at
least
make
the
effort
to
get
the
best
talent
there
is
if
we
have
the
cleverest
architect
here
so
much
the
better
an
open
competition
will
enable
us
to
find
out
after
all
benham
is
only
one
city
among
many
and
a
very
new
city
why
should
we
take
advantage
of
the
ideas
of
the
rest
of
the
country
the
older
portion
of
the
country
pierce
built
our
house
and
we
think
it
very
satisfactory
and
pretty
selma
tone
was
firm
but
she
eyed
her
hostess
narrowly
she
had
begun
of
late
to
distrust
the
æsthetic
worth
of
the
colored
glass
and
metal
stag
and
though
she
was
on
her
guard
against
effrontery
she
wished
to
know
the
truth
she
knew
that
pierce
with
fine
business
instinct
had
already
conveyed
to
her
husband
the
promise
that
he
should
furnish
the
varnish
for
the
new
church
in
case
of
his
own
selection
which
as
babcock
had
remarked
would
be
a
nice
thing
all
round
taylor
underwent
the
scrutiny
without
flinching
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
pierce
he
is
capable
within
his
lights
indeed
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
we
shall
get
nothing
more
satisfactory
elsewhere
flagg
grim
pile
is
anything
but
encouraging
that
may
sound
like
an
argument
against
my
plan
but
in
the
case
of
the
flagg
house
there
was
no
competition
merely
unenlightened
choice
on
the
one
side
and
ignorant
experimenting
on
the
other
you
do
seem
to
think
very
highly
of
the
appearance
of
benham
said
selma
the
remark
was
slightly
interrogative
but
was
combative
withal
she
wished
to
know
if
everything
from
the
flagg
mansion
down
was
open
to
criticism
but
she
would
fain
question
the
authority
of
the
censor
this
glib
graceful
woman
whose
white
starched
cuffs
seemed
to
make
light
of
her
own
sober
unadorned
wrists
this
time
taylor
flushed
faintly
she
realized
that
their
relations
had
reached
a
critical
point
and
that
the
next
step
might
be
fatal
she
put
down
her
teacup
and
leaning
forward
said
with
smiling
confidential
eagerness
i
do
i
would
admit
it
to
anyone
else
but
what
the
use
of
mincing
matters
with
an
intelligent
woman
like
you
i
might
put
you
off
now
and
declare
that
benham
is
well
enough
but
you
would
soon
divine
what
i
really
think
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
confidence
between
us
i
like
honesty
and
frankness
and
i
can
see
that
you
do
my
opinion
of
benham
architecture
is
that
it
is
and
mongrel
there
you
see
i
put
myself
in
your
hands
but
i
do
so
because
i
feel
sure
you
nearly
agree
with
me
already
you
know
it
so
but
you
hate
to
acknowledge
it
selma
eyes
were
bright
with
interest
she
felt
flattered
by
the
appeal
and
there
was
a
righteous
assurance
in
taylor
manner
which
was
convincing
she
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
what
she
did
not
quite
know
but
taylor
raised
her
hand
by
way
of
interdiction
do
answer
yet
let
me
show
you
what
i
mean
i
as
proud
of
benham
as
anyone
i
am
absorbed
by
the
place
i
look
to
see
it
fifty
years
hence
perhaps
less
a
great
city
and
a
beautiful
city
too
just
at
present
everything
is
commercial
and
and
ethical
yes
ethical
we
wish
to
do
and
dare
but
we
have
time
to
adorn
as
we
construct
that
is
most
of
us
have
but
if
a
few
determined
spirits
women
though
they
be
cry
art
may
get
a
chance
here
and
there
to
assert
herself
look
at
this
she
said
gliding
across
the
room
and
holding
up
a
small
vase
of
exquisite
shape
and
coloring
i
picked
it
up
on
the
other
side
and
it
stands
almost
for
a
lost
art
the
hands
and
taste
which
wrought
it
represent
the
transmitted
patience
and
skill
of
hundreds
of
years
we
like
to
rush
things
through
in
a
few
weeks
on
a
design
hastily
conceived
by
a
pierce
because
we
are
so
earnest
now
we
wo
do
it
this
time
will
we
no
we
wo
said
selma
i
see
what
you
mean
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
you
did
give
us
credit
for
the
earnestness
for
the
ethical
part
that
the
first
thing
the
great
thing
according
to
my
idea
and
it
what
distinguishes
us
from
foreigners
the
foreigners
who
made
that
vase
for
instance
but
i
agree
with
you
that
there
such
a
thing
as
going
too
fast
and
very
likely
some
of
the
buildings
here
are
all
they
might
be
we
do
need
to
model
them
on
foreign
patterns
but
we
must
have
them
pretty
and
right
certainly
certainly
my
dear
what
we
should
strive
for
is
originality
american
originality
but
soberly
slowly
art
is
evolved
painfully
little
by
little
it
ca
be
bought
at
shops
for
the
asking
like
tea
and
sugar
if
we
invite
designs
for
the
new
church
we
shall
give
the
youths
of
the
country
who
have
ideas
seething
in
their
heads
a
chance
to
express
themselves
who
knows
but
we
may
unearth
a
genius
who
knows
echoed
selma
with
her
spiritual
look
yes
you
are
right
taylor
i
will
help
you
as
you
say
there
must
be
hundreds
of
young
men
who
would
like
to
do
just
that
sort
of
thing
i
know
myself
what
it
is
to
have
lived
in
a
small
place
without
the
opportunity
to
show
what
one
could
do
to
feel
the
capacity
but
to
be
without
the
means
and
occasion
to
reveal
what
is
in
one
and
now
that
i
understand
we
really
look
at
things
the
same
way
i
glad
to
join
with
you
in
making
benham
beautiful
as
you
say
we
women
can
do
much
if
we
only
will
i
the
greatest
faith
in
woman
mission
in
this
new
interesting
nation
of
ours
have
you
taylor
do
you
believe
that
she
in
her
new
sphere
of
usefulness
is
one
of
the
great
moving
forces
of
the
republic
selma
was
talking
rapidly
and
had
lost
every
trace
of
suspicious
restraint
she
spoke
as
one
transfigured
yes
indeed
answered
taylor
checking
any
disposition
she
may
have
felt
to
interpose
qualifications
she
could
acquiesce
generally
without
violence
to
her
convictions
and
she
could
not
afford
to
imperil
the
safety
of
the
immediate
issue
her
church
i
felt
sure
you
would
feel
so
if
you
only
had
time
to
reflect
she
added
if
you
vote
with
us
you
will
have
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
knowing
that
you
have
advanced
woman
cause
just
so
much
you
may
count
on
my
vote
selma
stopped
on
her
way
home
although
it
was
late
to
purchase
some
white
cuffs
as
she
approached
her
husband
stood
on
the
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
he
was
whistling
and
when
he
saw
her
he
kissed
his
hand
at
her
jubilantly
well
sweetheart
where
you
been
visiting
taking
tea
with
taylor
i
promised
her
to
vote
to
invite
bids
for
the
church
plans
babcock
looked
surprised
that
throw
pierce
out
wo
it
not
unless
some
one
else
submits
a
better
design
than
he
lewis
scratched
his
head
i
considered
that
order
for
varnish
as
good
as
booked
i
not
sure
pierce
knows
as
much
as
he
thinks
he
does
said
selma
oracularly
we
shall
get
plans
from
new
york
and
boston
if
we
like
them
we
need
take
them
but
that
the
way
to
get
an
artistic
thing
and
we
going
to
have
the
most
artistic
church
in
benham
sorry
about
the
varnish
but
a
principle
is
involved
babcock
was
puzzled
but
content
he
cared
far
more
for
the
disappointment
to
pierce
than
for
the
loss
of
the
order
but
apart
from
the
business
side
of
the
question
he
never
doubted
that
his
wife
must
be
right
nor
did
he
feel
obliged
to
inquire
what
principle
was
involved
he
was
pleased
to
have
her
associate
with
taylor
and
was
satisfied
that
she
would
be
a
credit
to
him
in
any
situation
where
occult
questions
of
art
or
learning
were
mooted
he
dropped
his
hose
and
pulled
her
down
beside
him
on
the
porch
settee
there
was
a
beautiful
sunset
and
the
atmosphere
was
soft
and
refreshing
selma
felt
satisfied
with
herself
as
taylor
had
said
it
was
her
vote
which
would
turn
the
scale
on
behalf
of
progress
other
things
too
were
in
her
mind
she
was
not
ready
to
admit
that
she
had
been
instructed
but
she
was
already
planning
changes
in
her
own
domestic
interior
suggested
by
what
she
had
seen
she
let
her
husband
squeeze
her
hand
but
her
thoughts
were
wandering
from
his
blandishments
presently
she
said
lewis
i
begun
lately
to
doubt
if
that
stag
is
really
pretty
the
stag
well
now
i
always
thought
it
tasty
one
of
the
features
of
our
little
place
no
one
would
mistake
it
for
a
real
deer
it
looks
to
me
almost
comical
babcock
turned
to
regard
judicially
the
object
of
her
criticism
i
like
it
he
said
somewhat
mournfully
as
though
he
were
puzzled
but
if
you
do
we
change
the
stag
for
something
else
i
wish
you
to
be
pleased
first
of
all
instead
we
might
have
a
fountain
two
children
under
an
umbrella
i
saw
the
other
day
it
was
cute
how
does
that
strike
you
i
ca
tell
without
seeing
it
and
lewis
promise
me
that
you
select
anything
new
of
that
sort
until
i
have
looked
at
it
very
well
babcock
answered
submissively
but
he
continued
to
look
puzzled
in
his
estimate
of
his
wife
superiority
to
himself
in
the
subtleties
of
life
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
include
the
choice
of
objects
of
art
he
had
eyes
and
could
judge
for
himself
like
any
other
american
citizen
still
he
was
only
too
glad
to
humor
selma
in
such
an
unimportant
matter
especially
as
he
was
eager
for
her
happiness
chapter
iv
seven
designs
for
the
new
church
were
submitted
including
three
from
benham
architects
the
leaven
of
influence
exercised
by
spirits
like
taylor
was
only
just
beginning
to
work
and
the
now
common
custom
of
competing
outside
one
own
bailiwick
was
still
in
embryo
pierce
design
was
bold
and
sumptuous
his
stated
oracularly
not
long
before
the
day
when
the
plans
were
to
be
opened
pierce
is
not
a
man
to
be
frightened
out
of
a
job
by
frills
mark
my
words
he
will
give
us
an
elegant
thing
pierce
had
conceived
the
happy
thought
of
combining
a
moorish
mosque
and
new
england
in
a
conservative
and
equitable
medley
evidently
hoping
thereby
to
be
both
picturesque
and
traditional
the
result
even
on
paper
was
too
bold
for
some
of
his
admirers
the
chairman
was
heard
to
remark
i
should
feel
as
though
i
was
in
church
that
dome
set
among
spires
is
close
to
making
a
theatre
of
the
house
of
god
the
discomfiture
of
the
first
architect
of
benham
cleared
the
way
for
the
triumph
of
taylor
taste
the
design
submitted
by
wilbur
littleton
of
new
york
seemed
to
her
decidedly
the
most
meritorious
it
was
graceful
appropriate
and
artistic
entirely
in
harmony
with
religious
associations
yet
agreeably
different
from
every
day
sanctuaries
the
choice
lay
between
his
and
that
presented
by
cass
a
benham
builder
a
serviceable
but
very
conventional
edifice
the
stove
dealer
on
the
committee
declared
in
favor
of
the
native
design
as
simpler
and
more
solid
it
be
a
massive
structure
he
said
and
when
it
finished
no
one
will
have
to
ask
what
it
is
it
speak
for
itself
cass
is
a
solid
business
man
and
we
know
what
we
get
the
other
plan
is
what
i
call
dandified
it
was
evident
to
the
committee
that
the
stove
dealer
final
criticism
comprehended
the
architect
as
well
as
his
design
several
competitors
littleton
among
them
had
come
in
person
to
explain
the
merits
of
their
respective
drawings
and
by
the
side
of
solid
undecorative
cass
littleton
may
well
have
seemed
a
dandy
he
was
a
slim
young
man
with
a
delicate
sensitive
face
and
intelligent
brown
eyes
he
looked
eager
and
interesting
in
his
case
the
almost
gaunt
american
physiognomy
was
softened
by
a
suggestion
of
poetic
impulses
yet
the
heritage
of
nervous
energy
was
apparent
his
appearance
conveyed
the
impression
of
quiet
trigness
and
gentility
his
figure
lent
itself
to
his
clothes
which
were
utterly
inconspicuous
judged
by
metropolitan
standards
but
flawless
in
the
face
of
theories
of
life
and
aroused
suspicion
he
spoke
in
a
gentle
but
earnest
manner
pointing
out
clearly
yet
modestly
the
merits
of
his
composition
selma
had
never
seen
a
man
just
like
him
before
and
she
noticed
that
from
the
outset
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
fastened
on
her
as
though
his
words
were
intended
for
her
special
benefit
she
had
never
read
the
lines
indeed
they
had
not
been
written
i
think
i
could
be
happy
with
a
gentleman
like
you
nor
did
the
precise
sentiment
contained
in
them
shape
itself
in
her
thought
yet
she
was
suddenly
conscious
that
she
had
been
starving
for
lack
of
intellectual
companionship
and
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
she
had
hoped
to
meet
the
sort
of
man
who
could
appreciate
her
and
whom
she
could
appreciate
it
did
not
become
necessary
for
selma
to
act
as
champion
for
the
stove
dealer
criticism
found
only
one
supporter
the
new
yorker
design
for
the
church
was
so
obviously
pretty
and
suitable
that
a
majority
of
the
committee
promptly
declared
in
its
favor
the
successful
competitor
who
had
remained
a
day
to
learn
the
result
was
solemnly
informed
of
the
decision
and
then
elaborately
introduced
to
the
members
in
shaking
hands
with
him
selma
experienced
a
shade
of
embarrassment
it
was
plain
that
his
words
to
her
spoken
with
a
low
bow
i
am
very
much
gratified
that
my
work
pleases
you
conveyed
a
more
spiritual
significance
than
was
contained
in
his
thanks
to
the
others
still
he
seemed
more
at
his
ease
with
taylor
who
promptly
broke
the
ice
of
the
situation
by
fixing
him
as
a
close
relative
of
friends
in
baltimore
straightway
he
became
sprightly
and
voluble
speaking
of
things
and
people
beyond
selma
experience
this
social
jargon
irritated
selma
it
seemed
to
her
a
profanation
of
a
noble
character
yet
she
was
annoyed
because
she
could
not
understand
taylor
having
discovered
in
littleton
one
who
should
have
been
a
friend
long
before
succeeded
in
carrying
him
off
to
dinner
yet
before
taking
his
leave
he
came
back
to
selma
for
a
few
words
she
had
overheard
taylor
invitation
and
she
asked
herself
why
she
too
might
not
become
better
acquainted
with
this
young
man
whose
attitude
toward
her
was
that
of
respectful
admiration
to
have
a
strange
young
man
to
dine
struck
her
as
novel
she
had
a
general
conviction
that
it
would
seem
to
lewis
closely
allied
to
light
conduct
and
that
only
foreigners
or
frivolous
people
let
down
to
this
extent
the
bars
of
family
life
now
that
taylor
had
set
her
the
example
she
was
less
certain
of
the
moral
turpitude
of
such
an
act
but
she
concluded
also
that
her
husband
would
be
in
the
way
at
table
what
she
desired
was
an
opportunity
for
a
long
interesting
chat
about
high
things
while
she
reflected
he
was
saying
to
her
i
understand
that
your
committee
is
to
supervise
my
work
until
the
new
church
is
completed
so
i
shall
hope
to
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
you
occasionally
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
make
trips
here
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
everything
is
being
done
correctly
by
the
mechanics
do
you
go
away
immediately
it
may
be
that
i
shall
be
detained
by
the
arrangements
which
i
must
make
here
until
day
after
if
you
would
really
like
to
see
me
i
live
at
onslow
avenue
thank
you
very
much
littleton
took
out
a
small
memorandum
book
and
carefully
noted
the
address
babcock
onslow
avenue
i
shall
make
a
point
of
calling
afternoon
if
i
stay
and
probably
i
shall
he
bowed
and
left
selma
pleasantly
stirred
by
the
interview
his
voice
was
low
and
his
enunciation
sympathetically
fluent
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
give
him
afternoon
tea
and
they
would
compare
ideas
together
she
felt
sure
that
his
must
be
interesting
later
in
the
evening
at
taylor
when
there
was
a
pause
in
their
sympathetic
interchange
of
social
and
æsthetic
convictions
littleton
said
abruptly
tell
me
something
please
about
babcock
she
has
a
suggestive
as
well
as
a
beautiful
face
and
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
she
is
genuinely
american
not
one
of
the
women
of
whom
we
were
speaking
who
seem
to
be
ashamed
of
their
own
institutions
and
who
ape
foreign
manners
and
customs
i
fancy
she
would
illustrate
what
i
was
saying
just
now
as
to
the
vital
importance
of
our
clinging
to
our
heritage
of
independent
thought
of
accepting
the
truth
of
the
ancient
order
of
things
without
allowing
its
lies
and
demerits
to
enslave
us
i
suppose
so
said
taylor
she
certainly
does
not
belong
to
the
dangerous
class
of
whom
you
were
speaking
i
was
flattering
myself
that
neither
did
i
for
i
was
agreeing
with
all
you
said
as
to
the
need
of
cherishing
our
native
originality
yet
i
must
confess
that
now
that
you
compare
me
with
her
the
actual
comparison
is
my
own
but
you
instigated
it
i
begin
to
feel
more
doubts
about
myself
that
is
if
she
is
the
true
species
and
i
inclined
to
think
she
is
pray
excuse
this
indirect
method
of
answering
your
inquiry
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
soliloquy
it
is
an
airing
of
thoughts
and
doubts
which
have
been
harassing
me
for
a
fortnight
ever
since
i
knew
babcock
really
littleton
i
can
tell
you
very
little
about
her
she
is
a
on
the
horizon
of
benham
she
has
been
married
very
recently
i
believe
she
has
taught
school
and
that
she
was
brought
up
not
far
from
here
she
is
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
sometimes
as
beautiful
she
is
profoundly
serious
and
and
apparently
very
ignorant
i
fancy
she
is
clever
and
capable
in
her
way
but
i
admit
she
is
an
enigma
to
me
and
that
i
have
not
solved
it
i
can
see
she
does
not
approve
of
me
altogether
she
regards
me
with
suspicion
and
yet
she
threw
the
casting
vote
in
favor
of
my
proposal
to
open
the
competition
for
the
church
to
architects
from
other
places
i
am
trying
to
like
her
for
i
wish
to
believe
in
everything
genuinely
american
if
i
can
there
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
and
to
a
man
she
may
seem
altogether
attractive
and
inspiring
thank
you
i
had
no
conception
that
i
was
broaching
such
a
complex
subject
she
sounds
interesting
and
my
curiosity
is
whetted
you
have
not
mentioned
the
husband
to
be
sure
a
burly
manufacturer
of
varnish
without
much
education
i
should
judge
he
is
manifestly
her
inferior
in
half
a
dozen
ways
but
i
understand
that
he
is
making
money
and
he
looks
kind
wilbur
littleton
life
since
he
had
come
to
man
estate
had
been
a
struggle
and
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
make
headway
he
had
never
had
time
to
commiserate
himself
for
necessity
on
the
one
hand
and
youthful
ambition
on
the
other
had
kept
his
energies
tense
and
his
thoughts
sane
and
hopeful
he
and
his
sister
pauline
a
year
his
senior
had
been
left
orphans
while
both
were
students
by
the
death
of
their
father
on
the
battlefield
to
persevere
in
their
respective
tastes
and
work
out
their
educations
had
been
a
labor
of
love
but
an
undertaking
which
demanded
rigorous
on
the
part
of
each
wilbur
had
determined
to
become
an
architect
pauline
early
interested
in
the
dogma
that
woman
must
no
longer
be
barred
from
intellectual
companionship
with
man
had
sought
to
cultivate
herself
intelligently
without
sacrificing
her
brother
domestic
comfort
she
had
succeeded
their
home
in
new
york
despite
its
small
dimensions
and
frugal
hospitality
was
already
a
favorite
resort
of
a
little
group
of
professional
people
with
busy
brains
and
light
purses
wilbur
was
in
the
throes
of
early
progress
he
had
no
relatives
or
influential
friends
to
give
him
business
and
employment
came
slowly
he
had
been
an
architect
on
his
own
account
for
two
years
but
was
still
obliged
to
supplement
his
professional
orders
by
work
as
a
draughtsman
for
others
yet
his
enthusiasm
kept
him
buoyant
in
respect
to
his
own
work
he
was
scrupulous
indeed
a
stern
critic
he
abhorred
claptrap
and
specious
effects
and
aimed
at
high
standards
of
artistic
expression
this
gave
him
position
among
his
brother
architects
but
was
incompatible
with
meteoric
progress
his
design
for
the
church
at
benham
represented
much
thought
and
hope
and
he
felt
happy
at
his
success
littleton
familiarity
with
women
apart
from
his
sister
had
been
slight
but
his
thoughts
regarding
them
were
in
keeping
with
a
poetic
and
aspiring
nature
he
hoped
to
marry
some
day
and
he
was
fond
of
picturing
to
himself
in
moments
of
reverie
the
sort
of
woman
to
whom
his
heart
would
be
given
in
the
shrine
of
his
secret
fancy
she
appeared
primarily
as
an
object
of
reverence
a
angel
of
light
clad
in
the
graceful
outlines
of
flesh
an
amazon
and
yet
a
winsome
tender
spirit
and
above
all
a
being
imbued
with
the
stimulating
intellectual
independence
he
had
been
taught
to
associate
with
american
womanhood
she
would
be
the
loving
wife
of
his
bosom
and
the
intelligent
sharer
of
his
thoughts
and
aspirations
often
their
guide
so
pure
and
exacting
was
his
ideal
that
while
alive
to
the
value
of
coyness
and
coquetry
as
elements
of
feminine
attraction
for
others
wilbur
had
chosen
to
regard
the
maiden
of
his
faith
as
too
serious
a
spirit
to
condescend
to
such
vanities
and
from
a
similar
vein
of
appreciation
he
was
prone
to
think
of
her
as
unadorned
or
rather
untarnished
by
the
gewgaws
of
fashionable
dressmaking
and
millinery
his
first
sight
of
selma
had
made
him
conscious
that
here
was
a
face
not
unlike
what
he
had
hoped
to
encounter
some
day
and
he
had
instinctively
felt
her
to
be
sympathetic
he
was
even
conscious
of
disappointment
when
he
heard
her
addressed
as
babcock
evidently
she
was
a
soul
unhampered
by
the
social
weaknesses
of
a
large
city
and
illumined
by
the
spiritual
grace
of
native
womanliness
so
he
thought
of
her
and
taylor
diagnosis
rather
confirmed
than
impaired
his
impression
for
in
taylor
wilbur
felt
he
discerned
a
trace
of
antagonism
born
of
cosmopolitan
prejudice
an
inability
to
value
at
its
true
worth
a
nature
not
moulded
on
conventional
lines
rigorous
as
he
was
in
his
judgments
and
eager
to
disown
what
was
cheap
or
shallow
mere
conventionalism
whether
in
art
or
daily
life
was
no
less
abhorrent
to
him
here
he
said
to
himself
was
an
original
soul
ignorant
and
unenlightened
perhaps
but
endowed
with
swift
perception
and
capable
of
noble
development
the
appearance
of
selma
scroll
and
glass
bedizened
house
did
not
affect
this
impression
wilbur
was
first
of
all
appreciatively
an
american
that
is
he
recognized
that
native
energy
had
hitherto
been
expended
on
the
things
of
the
spirit
to
the
neglect
of
things
material
as
an
artist
he
was
supremely
interested
in
awakening
and
guiding
the
national
taste
in
respect
to
art
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
thoroughly
aware
that
the
peculiar
vigor
and
independence
of
character
which
he
knew
as
americanism
was
often
utterly
indifferent
to
or
ignorant
of
the
value
of
æsthetics
after
all
art
was
a
secondary
consideration
whereas
the
inward
vision
which
absorbed
the
attention
of
the
thoughtful
among
his
countrymen
and
countrywomen
was
an
absolute
essential
without
which
the
soul
must
lose
its
fineness
he
himself
was
seeking
to
show
that
beauty
in
external
material
expression
was
not
merely
consistent
with
strong
ideals
but
requisite
to
their
fit
presentment
he
recognized
too
that
the
various
and
variegated
departures
from
the
monotonous
homely
pattern
of
the
american
house
which
were
evident
in
each
live
town
were
but
so
many
indicators
that
the
nation
was
beginning
to
realize
the
truth
of
this
his
battle
was
with
the
designers
and
builders
who
were
guiding
falsely
and
flamboyantly
not
with
the
deceived
victims
nor
with
those
who
were
still
satisfied
merely
to
look
inwardly
and
ignored
form
and
color
hence
he
would
have
been
able
to
behold
the
babcocks
iron
stag
without
rancor
had
the
animal
still
occupied
the
selma
when
she
saw
the
figure
of
her
visitor
in
the
congratulated
herself
that
it
had
been
removed
it
would
have
pleased
her
to
know
that
littleton
had
already
placed
her
in
a
niche
above
the
level
of
mere
considerations
that
was
where
she
belonged
of
course
but
she
was
fearful
on
the
score
of
suspected
shortcomings
so
it
was
gratifying
to
be
able
to
receive
him
in
a
smarter
gown
to
be
wearing
white
cuffs
and
to
offer
him
tea
with
a
touch
of
taylor
tormenting
urbanity
not
so
unreservedly
as
she
that
would
never
do
it
was
and
never
would
be
in
keeping
with
her
own
ideas
of
serious
still
a
touch
of
it
was
grateful
to
herself
she
felt
that
it
was
a
grace
and
enhanced
her
effectiveness
a
few
moments
later
selma
realized
that
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
lived
in
benham
she
was
being
understood
and
appreciated
she
felt
too
that
for
the
first
time
she
was
talking
to
a
kindred
spirit
to
be
sure
to
one
different
and
more
technically
proficient
in
concrete
knowledge
possibly
more
able
too
to
express
his
thoughts
in
words
but
eminently
a
comrade
and
sympathizer
she
was
not
obliged
to
say
much
nor
were
indeed
his
actual
words
the
source
of
her
realization
the
revelation
came
from
what
was
left
unsaid
from
the
silent
recognition
by
him
that
she
was
worthy
to
share
his
best
thoughts
and
was
herself
a
serious
worker
in
the
struggle
of
life
no
graceful
but
galling
attitude
of
superiority
no
polite
indifference
to
her
no
disposition
to
criticise
and
yet
he
was
no
less
voluble
clever
and
spirited
than
taylor
she
listened
with
wrapt
interest
to
his
easy
talk
which
was
ever
grave
in
tone
despite
his
pleasant
sallies
he
spoke
of
benham
with
quick
appreciation
of
its
bustling
energy
and
let
her
see
that
he
divined
its
capacity
for
greatness
this
led
him
to
refer
with
kindling
eyes
to
the
keen
impulse
toward
education
and
culture
which
was
animating
the
younger
men
and
women
of
the
country
to
the
new
beginnings
of
art
literature
and
scientific
investigation
at
scarcely
a
hint
from
her
he
told
briefly
of
his
past
life
and
his
hopes
and
fondly
mentioned
his
sister
and
her
present
absorption
in
some
history
courses
for
women
and
you
he
said
you
are
a
student
too
taylor
has
told
me
but
i
should
have
guessed
it
duties
even
more
interesting
claim
you
now
but
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
you
have
known
that
other
happiness
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
days
his
words
sounded
musical
though
the
quotation
from
lycidas
was
unfamiliar
to
her
ears
her
brain
was
thrilling
with
the
import
of
all
he
had
told
her
with
his
allusions
to
the
intellectual
and
ethical
movements
of
boston
and
new
york
in
which
she
felt
herself
by
right
and
with
his
recognition
a
partner
and
peer
you
were
teaching
school
when
you
married
i
believe
he
added
yes
and
before
that
if
i
may
ask
i
lived
at
westfield
with
my
father
it
is
a
small
country
town
but
we
tried
to
be
in
earnest
i
understand
i
understand
you
grew
up
among
the
trees
and
the
breezes
and
the
brooks
those
wonderful
wordless
teachers
i
envy
you
for
they
give
one
time
to
think
to
expand
i
have
known
only
city
life
myself
it
is
stimulating
but
one
is
so
easily
turned
aside
from
direct
purpose
do
you
write
at
all
not
yet
but
i
have
wished
to
some
day
i
shall
just
now
i
have
too
many
domestic
concerns
to
she
did
not
finish
for
babcock
heavy
tread
and
whistle
resounded
in
the
hall
and
at
the
next
moment
he
was
calling
selma
she
felt
annoyed
at
being
interrupted
but
she
divined
that
it
would
never
do
to
show
it
my
husband
she
said
and
she
raised
her
voice
to
utter
with
a
sugared
dignity
which
would
have
done
credit
to
taylor
i
am
in
the
parlor
lewis
enter
your
chief
domestic
concern
said
littleton
blithely
a
happy
home
is
preferable
to
all
the
poems
and
novels
in
the
world
babcock
pushing
open
the
door
which
stood
ajar
stopped
short
in
his
melody
this
is
littleton
lewis
the
architect
of
our
new
church
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
by
way
of
accounting
for
the
sudden
softening
of
his
brow
babcock
added
i
set
you
down
at
first
as
one
of
those
agents
there
was
one
here
last
week
who
would
take
for
an
answer
he
has
an
advantage
over
me
answered
littleton
with
a
laugh
in
my
business
a
man
ca
solicit
orders
he
has
to
sit
and
wait
for
them
to
come
to
him
i
want
to
know
my
wife
thinks
a
lot
of
your
drawings
for
the
new
church
i
hope
to
make
it
a
credit
to
your
city
i
just
been
saying
to
your
wife
babcock
that
benham
has
a
fine
future
before
it
the
very
atmosphere
seems
charged
with
progress
babcock
beamed
approvingly
it
a
driving
place
sir
the
man
in
benham
who
stops
by
the
to
scratch
his
head
gets
left
behind
when
we
moved
into
this
house
a
year
ago
looking
through
that
window
we
were
at
the
place
now
you
see
houses
cropping
up
in
every
direction
it
going
to
be
a
big
city
pleased
to
have
you
stop
to
supper
with
us
he
added
with
burly
suavity
as
their
visitor
rose
littleton
excused
himself
and
took
his
leave
babcock
escorted
him
to
the
front
door
and
full
of
his
subject
delayed
him
on
the
porch
to
touch
once
more
on
the
greatness
of
benham
there
was
a
clumsy
method
too
in
this
optimistic
garrulity
for
at
the
close
he
referred
with
some
pride
to
his
own
business
career
and
made
a
tender
of
his
business
card
lewis
babcock
company
varnishes
with
a
flourish
if
you
do
anything
in
my
line
pleased
to
accommodate
you
littleton
departing
tickled
by
a
pleasant
sense
of
humor
caught
through
the
parlor
window
a
last
glimpse
of
selma
inspired
face
bowing
gravely
yet
wistfully
in
acknowledgment
of
his
lifted
hat
and
he
strode
away
under
the
spell
of
a
brain
picture
which
he
transmuted
into
words
there
the
sort
of
case
where
the
cynical
foreigner
fails
to
appreciate
the
true
import
of
our
american
life
that
couple
typifies
the
elements
of
greatness
in
our
people
at
first
blush
the
husband
rough
and
material
but
he
shrewd
and
enterprising
and
vigorous
the
bread
winner
he
enormously
proud
of
her
and
he
has
reason
to
be
for
she
is
a
constant
stimulus
to
higher
things
little
by
little
and
without
his
knowing
it
perhaps
she
will
smoothe
and
elevate
him
and
they
will
develop
together
growing
in
intelligence
and
cultivation
as
they
wax
in
worldly
goods
after
all
woman
is
our
most
marvellous
native
product
that
sort
of
woman
heigho
having
given
vent
to
this
sigh
littleton
proceeded
to
recognize
the
hopelessness
of
the
personal
situation
by
murmuring
with
a
slightly
forced
access
of
sprightliness
if
she
be
not
fair
for
me
what
care
i
how
fair
she
be
still
he
intended
to
see
more
of
babcock
and
that
without
infringing
the
tenth
or
any

chapter
selma
knew
intuitively
that
an
american
woman
was
able
to
cook
a
smooth
custard
write
a
poem
and
control
real
society
with
one
and
the
same
brain
and
hand
and
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
realization
of
the
apotheosis
but
though
she
was
aware
that
children
are
the
natural
increment
of
wedlock
she
had
put
the
idea
from
her
ever
since
her
marriage
as
impersonal
and
vaguely
disgusting
consequently
her
confinement
came
as
an
unwelcome
interruption
of
her
occupations
and
plans
her
connection
with
the
committee
for
the
new
church
had
proved
an
introduction
to
other
interests
charitable
and
social
one
day
she
was
taken
by
taylor
to
a
meeting
of
the
benham
woman
institute
a
literary
club
recently
established
by
margaret
rodney
earle
a
western
newspaper
woman
who
had
made
her
home
in
benham
selma
came
in
upon
some
twenty
of
her
own
sex
in
a
hotel
private
parlor
hired
weekly
for
the
uses
of
the
institute
earle
the
president
a
large
florid
woman
of
fifty
with
gray
hair
rising
from
the
brow
fluent
of
speech
endowed
with
a
public
manner
a
commanding
bust
and
a
vigorous
ingratiating
smile
wielded
a
gavel
at
a
little
table
and
directed
the
exercises
a
paper
on
shakespeare
heroines
was
read
and
discussed
selections
on
the
piano
followed
a
thin
woman
in
the
literary
editor
of
the
recited
curfew
must
not
ring
and
a
visitor
from
wisconsin
gave
an
exhibition
in
melodious
whistling
in
the
intervals
tea
chocolate
with
whipped
cream
and
little
cakes
were
dispensed
selma
was
absorbed
and
thrilled
what
could
be
more
to
her
taste
than
this
at
the
close
of
the
whistling
exercise
earle
came
over
and
spoke
to
her
they
took
a
strong
fancy
to
each
other
on
the
spot
selma
preferred
a
person
who
would
tell
you
everything
about
herself
and
to
whom
you
could
tell
everything
about
yourself
without
preliminaries
people
like
taylor
repressed
her
but
the
motherly
loquacity
and
comprehension
of
earle
drew
her
out
and
thawed
at
once
and
forever
the
ice
of
acquaintanceship
before
she
quite
realized
the
extent
of
this
fascination
she
had
promised
to
recite
something
and
as
in
a
dream
but
with
flushing
cheeks
she
heard
the
president
rap
the
table
and
announce
you
will
be
gratified
to
hear
that
a
talented
friend
who
is
with
us
has
kindly
consented
to
favor
us
with
a
recital
i
have
the
honor
to
introduce
lewis
babcock
after
the
first
flush
of
nervousness
selma
grave
dignity
came
to
her
support
and
justified
her
completely
in
her
own
eyes
her
father
had
been
fond
of
verse
especially
of
verse
imbued
with
moral
melancholy
and
at
his
suggestion
she
had
learned
and
had
been
wont
to
repeat
many
of
the
occasional
pieces
which
he
cut
from
the
newspapers
and
collected
in
a
her
own
preference
among
these
was
the
poem
o
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
which
she
had
been
told
was
a
great
favorite
of
abraham
lincoln
it
was
this
piece
which
came
into
her
mind
when
earle
broached
the
subject
and
this
she
proceeded
to
deliver
with
august
precision
she
spoke
clearly
and
solemnly
without
the
trace
of
the
giggling
protestation
which
is
so
often
incident
to
feminine
diffidence
she
treated
the
opportunity
with
the
seriousness
expected
for
though
the
institute
was
not
proof
against
light
and
diverting
contributions
as
the
whistling
performance
indicated
levity
of
spirit
would
have
been
out
of
place
is
a
twink
of
the
eye
is
a
draught
of
the
breath
from
the
blossom
of
health
to
the
paleness
of
death
from
the
gilded
saloon
to
the
bier
and
the
shroud
o
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
selma
enjoyed
the
harmony
between
the
long
slow
cadence
of
the
metre
and
the
important
gravity
of
the
theme
she
rolled
out
the
verses
with
the
intensity
of
a
seer
and
she
looked
a
beautiful
seer
as
well
liberal
applause
greeted
her
as
she
sat
down
though
the
clapping
woman
is
apt
to
be
a
feeble
instrument
at
best
selma
knew
that
she
had
produced
an
impression
and
she
was
moved
by
her
own
effectiveness
she
was
compelled
to
swallow
once
or
twice
to
conceal
the
tears
in
her
voice
while
listening
to
the
congratulations
of
earle
the
words
which
she
had
just
recited
were
ringing
through
her
brain
and
seemed
to
her
to
express
the
pitch
at
which
her
life
was
keyed
selma
was
chosen
a
member
of
the
institute
at
the
next
meeting
and
forthwith
she
became
intimate
with
the
president
margaret
rodney
earle
was
as
she
herself
phrased
it
a
live
woman
she
supported
herself
by
writing
for
the
newspapers
articles
of
a
morally
utilitarian
character
for
instance
a
winter
series
published
every
saturday
hints
on
health
and
culture
or
again
receipts
for
the
parlor
and
the
kitchen
she
also
contributed
poetry
of
a
pensive
cast
and
chatty
special
correspondence
flavored
with
personal
allusion
she
was
one
of
the
pioneers
in
modern
society
journalism
which
at
this
time
however
was
comparatively
veiled
and
delicate
in
its
methods
besides
she
was
a
woman
of
tireless
energy
with
theories
on
many
subjects
and
an
ardor
for
organization
she
advocated
prohibition
the
free
suffrage
of
woman
the
renunciation
of
corsets
and
was
interested
in
reforms
relating
to
labor
the
pauper
classes
and
the
public
schools
in
behalf
of
any
of
these
causes
she
was
ready
from
time
to
time
to
dash
off
an
article
at
short
notice
or
address
an
audience
but
her
dearest
concern
was
the
promotion
of
woman
culture
and
the
enlargement
of
woman
sphere
of
usefulness
through
the
club
the
idea
of
the
woman
club
which
was
taking
root
over
the
country
had
put
in
the
shade
for
the
time
being
all
her
other
plans
including
the
scheme
of
a
society
for
making
the
the
national
flower
as
the
founder
and
president
of
the
benham
institute
she
felt
that
she
had
found
an
avocation
peculiarly
adapted
to
her
capacities
and
she
was
already
actively
in
correspondence
with
clubs
of
a
similar
character
in
other
cities
in
the
hope
of
forming
a
national
organization
for
mutual
enlightenment
and
support
earle
received
selma
by
invitation
at
her
lodgings
the
following
day
and
so
quickly
did
their
friendship
ripen
that
at
the
end
of
two
hours
each
had
told
the
other
everything
selma
was
prone
instinctively
to
regard
as
aristocratic
and
any
limitations
to
confidence
the
evident
disposition
on
the
part
of
earle
to
expose
promptly
and
without
reserve
the
facts
of
her
past
and
her
plans
for
the
future
seemed
to
selma
typical
of
an
interesting
character
and
she
was
thankful
to
make
a
clean
breast
in
her
turn
as
far
as
was
possible
earle
domestic
experience
had
been
thorny
i
had
a
home
once
too
she
said
a
happy
home
i
thought
my
husband
said
he
loved
me
but
almost
from
the
first
we
had
trouble
it
went
on
so
from
month
to
month
and
finally
we
agreed
to
part
he
objected
my
dear
to
my
living
my
own
life
he
did
like
me
to
take
an
interest
in
things
outside
the
house
public
matters
i
was
elected
on
the
the
only
woman
and
he
ought
to
have
been
proud
he
said
he
was
at
first
but
he
was
too
fond
of
declaring
that
a
woman
place
is
in
her
kitchen
one
day
i
said
to
him
this
ca
go
on
if
we
ca
agree
we
better
separate
a
life
is
no
life
at
all
he
answered
back
not
asking
you
to
leave
me
but
if
set
on
it
do
let
me
hinder
you
margaret
you
do
need
a
man
to
support
you
you
as
good
as
a
man
yourself
he
meant
that
to
be
sarcastic
i
suppose
said
i
god
i
think
i
can
take
care
of
myself
even
though
i
am
a
woman
that
was
the
end
of
it
there
was
no
use
for
either
of
us
to
get
excited
i
packed
my
things
and
a
few
mornings
later
i
said
to
him
ellery
earle
i
wish
you
well
and
i
suppose
you
my
husband
still
but
i
going
to
live
my
own
life
without
let
or
hindrance
from
any
man
there
your
ring
my
holding
out
the
ring
was
startling
to
him
for
he
said
you
going
to
be
sorry
for
this
margaret
said
i
thought
it
all
out
and
it
best
for
both
of
us
there
your
ring
he
would
take
it
so
i
dropped
it
on
the
table
and
went
out
some
people
miss
it
and
misbelieve
i
was
ever
married
that
was
close
on
to
twenty
years
ago
and
i
never
seen
him
since
when
the
war
broke
out
i
heard
he
enlisted
but
what
become
of
him
i
do
know
maybe
he
got
a
divorce
i
kept
right
on
and
lived
my
own
life
in
my
own
way
and
never
lacked
food
or
raiment
i
years
old
but
i
feel
a
young
woman
still
notwithstanding
earle
directness
and
the
protuberance
of
her
bust
in
conclusion
by
way
of
reasserting
her
satisfaction
with
the
results
of
her
action
there
was
a
touch
of
plaintiveness
in
her
confession
which
suggested
the
womanly
author
of
hints
on
culture
and
hygiene
rather
than
the
this
was
lost
on
selma
who
was
fain
to
sympathize
purely
from
the
of
righteousness
it
was
splendid
she
said
he
had
no
right
to
prevent
you
living
your
own
life
no
husband
has
that
right
earle
brushed
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
you
mus
think
my
dear
that
i
not
a
believer
in
the
home
because
mine
has
been
unhappy
because
my
husband
did
or
could
understand
the
true
home
is
the
inspirer
and
nourisher
of
all
that
is
best
in
life
in
our
american
life
but
men
must
learn
the
new
lesson
there
are
many
homes
yours
i
sure
where
the
american
woman
has
encouragement
and
the
opportunity
to
expand
oh
yes
my
husband
lets
me
do
as
i
wish
i
made
him
promise
before
i
accepted
him
that
he
would
thwart
me
that
he
let
me
live
my
own
life
selma
was
so
appreciative
of
earle
and
so
energetic
and
suggestive
in
regard
to
the
scope
of
the
institute
that
she
was
presently
chosen
a
member
of
the
council
which
was
the
body
charged
with
the
supervision
of
the
fortnightly
entertainments
it
occurred
to
her
as
a
brilliant
conception
to
have
littleton
address
the
club
on
art
and
she
broached
the
subject
to
him
when
he
next
returned
to
benham
and
appeared
before
the
church
committee
he
declared
that
he
was
too
busy
to
prepare
a
suitable
lecture
but
he
yielded
finally
to
her
plea
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
let
the
women
of
benham
hear
his
views
and
opinions
they
are
wives
and
they
are
mothers
said
selma
sententiously
it
was
a
woman
vote
you
remember
which
elected
you
to
build
our
church
you
owe
it
to
art
do
you
think
so
a
logical
appeal
to
his
conscience
was
never
lost
on
littleton
besides
he
was
glad
to
oblige
babcock
who
seemed
so
earnest
in
her
desire
to
improve
the
æsthetic
taste
of
benham
accordingly
he
yielded
the
lecture
was
delivered
a
few
weeks
later
and
was
a
marked
success
for
littleton
earnestness
of
theme
and
manner
was
relieved
by
a
graceful
sympathetic
delivery
selma
whose
social
aplomb
was
increasing
every
day
glided
about
the
rooms
with
a
contented
mien
receiving
felicitations
and
passing
chocolate
she
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
the
god
behind
the
curtain
a
few
days
later
the
knowledge
that
she
herself
was
to
become
a
mother
was
forced
upon
her
attention
and
was
a
little
irksome
of
necessity
her
new
interests
would
be
interrupted
though
she
did
not
question
that
she
would
perform
maternal
duties
fitly
and
fully
they
seemed
to
her
less
peculiarly
adapted
to
her
than
concerns
of
the
intellect
and
the
spirit
however
the
possession
of
a
little
daughter
was
more
precious
to
her
than
she
had
expected
and
the
consciousness
that
the
tiny
doll
which
lay
upon
her
breast
was
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
bone
of
her
bone
affected
her
agreeably
and
stirred
her
imagination
it
should
be
reared
from
the
start
in
the
creed
of
soul
independence
and
expansion
and
she
herself
would
find
a
new
and
sacred
duty
in
catering
to
the
needs
of
this
budding
intelligence
so
she
reflected
as
she
lay
in
bed
but
the
outlook
was
a
little
marred
by
the
thought
that
the
baby
was
the
living
image
of
its
father
and
burly
not
altogether
desirable
cast
of
countenance
for
a
girl
what
a
pity
when
it
might
just
as
well
have
looked
like
her
babcock
on
his
part
was
transported
by
paternity
he
was
bubbling
over
with
appreciation
of
the
new
baby
and
fondly
believed
it
to
be
a
human
wonder
he
was
solicitous
on
the
score
of
its
infantile
ailments
and
loaded
it
with
gifts
and
toys
beyond
the
scope
of
its
enjoyment
he
went
about
the
house
whistling
more
exuberantly
than
ever
there
was
no
speck
on
his
horizon
no
fly
in
his
pot
of
ointment
it
was
he
who
urged
that
the
child
should
be
christened
promptly
though
glynn
was
not
disposed
to
dwell
on
the
clerical
barbarism
as
to
the
destiny
of
unbaptized
infants
babcock
was
cultivating
a
conservative
method
he
realized
that
there
was
no
object
in
taking
chances
illogical
as
was
the
theory
that
a
healthy
dog
which
had
bitten
him
should
be
killed
at
once
lest
it
subsequently
go
mad
and
he
contract
hydrophobia
he
was
too
happy
and
complacent
to
run
the
risk
of
letting
it
live
so
it
was
with
regard
to
baby
but
selma
chose
the
name
babcock
preferred
in
this
order
another
selma
sophia
after
his
mother
or
a
compliment
to
the
wife
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
but
selma
as
the
result
of
grave
thought
selected
muriel
grace
without
knowing
exactly
why
she
asked
taylor
to
be
godmother
the
ceremony
was
solemn
and
inspiring
to
her
she
knew
from
the
glass
in
her
room
that
she
was
looking
very
pretty
but
she
was
weak
and
emotional
the
baby
behaved
admirably
even
when
lewis
trembling
with
pride
held
it
out
to
glynn
for
baptism
and
held
it
so
that
the
blood
rushed
to
its
head
i
baptize
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
she
was
happy
and
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
the
divine
blessing
was
upon
her
and
her
house
and
after
all
baby
was
a
darling
and
her
husband
a
kind
manly
soul
with
the
help
of
heaven
she
would
prove
herself
their
good
angel
when
they
returned
home
there
was
a
whistle
of
old
silver
of
light
graceful
design
a
present
from
taylor
to
muriel
her
aunt
farley
compared
this
to
its
disparagement
with
one
already
purchased
by
lewis
on
the
gaudily
embossed
stem
of
which
perched
a
squirrel
with
a
nut
in
its
mouth
but
selma
shook
her
head
both
of
you
are
wrong
she
said
with
authority
this
is
a
beauty
it
does
look
new
to
my
eyes
protested
parley
of
course
it
is
new
i
should
wonder
if
she
bought
it
while
travelling
abroad
in
europe
it
artistic
and
and
i
sha
let
baby
destroy
it
babcock
glanced
from
one
gift
to
the
other
quizzically
then
by
way
of
disposing
of
the
subject
he
seized
his
daughter
in
his
arms
and
dandling
her
toward
the
ceiling
cried
if
it
artistic
things
we
must
have
this
is
the
most
artistic
thing
which
i
know
of
in
the
wide
world
are
you
little
farley
with
motherly
distrust
of
man
apprehensively
followed
with
her
eyes
and
arms
the
gyrations
of
rise
and
fall
but
selma
though
she
saw
pursued
the
current
of
her
own
thought
which
prompted
her
to
examine
her
she
was
thinking
that
compared
with
taylor
it
was
a
cart
wheel
a
clumsy
conspicuous
band
of
metal
instead
of
a
delicate
hoop
she
wondered
if
lewis
would
object
to
exchange
it
for
another
with
the
return
of
her
strength
selma
took
up
again
eagerly
the
tenor
of
her
former
life
aiding
and
abetting
earle
in
the
development
of
the
institute
the
president
was
absorbed
in
enlarging
its
scope
by
the
enrollment
of
more
members
and
the
establishment
of
classes
in
a
variety
of
topics
such
as
literature
science
philosophy
current
events
history
art
and
political
economy
she
aimed
to
construct
a
club
which
should
be
social
and
educational
in
the
broadest
sense
by
mutual
and
energy
selma
in
her
eagerness
to
make
the
most
of
the
opportunities
for
culture
offered
committed
herself
to
two
of
the
new
topic
classes
italian
and
grecian
art
and
the
governments
of
civilization
and
as
a
consequence
found
some
difficulty
in
accommodating
her
baby
nursing
hours
to
these
engagements
it
was
indeed
a
relief
to
her
when
the
doctor
presently
pronounced
the
supply
of
her
inadequate
she
was
able
to
assuage
lewis
regret
that
muriel
should
be
brought
up
by
hand
with
the
information
that
a
large
percentage
of
benham
and
american
mothers
were
similarly
barren
and
that
bottle
babies
were
exceedingly
healthy
she
had
gleaned
the
first
fact
from
the
physician
the
second
from
earle
and
her
own
conclusion
on
the
subject
was
that
a
lack
of
milk
was
an
indication
of
feminine
evolution
from
the
status
of
the
brute
creation
a
sign
of
spiritual
as
opposed
to
animal
quality
selma
found
earle
sympathetic
on
this
point
and
also
practical
in
her
suggestions
as
to
the
rearing
of
infants
by
artificial
means
recommendations
concerning
which
were
contained
in
one
of
her
series
of
papers
entitled
mother
lore
the
theory
of
the
new
classes
was
that
is
the
members
successively
turn
by
turn
lectured
on
the
topic
and
all
were
expected
to
study
in
the
interim
so
as
to
be
able
to
ask
questions
and
discuss
the
views
of
the
lecturer
concerning
both
italian
and
grecian
art
and
the
governments
of
civilization
selma
knew
that
she
had
convictions
in
the
abstract
but
when
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
specific
lecture
on
each
subject
it
occurred
to
her
as
wise
to
supplement
her
ideas
by
a
little
preparation
the
nucleus
of
a
public
library
had
been
recently
established
by
joel
flagg
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
benham
here
by
means
of
an
encyclopædia
and
two
selma
was
able
in
three
forenoons
to
compile
a
paper
satisfactory
to
her
on
the
dynasties
of
europe
and
their
inferiority
to
the
united
states
but
her
other
task
was
illumined
for
her
by
a
happy
incident
the
promise
of
littleton
to
lend
her
books
indeed
he
seemed
delightfully
interested
in
both
of
her
classes
which
was
especially
gratifying
in
view
of
the
fact
that
taylor
who
was
a
member
of
the
institute
had
combated
the
new
programme
on
the
plea
that
they
were
attempting
too
much
and
that
it
would
encourage
superficiality
but
littleton
seemed
appreciative
of
the
value
of
the
undertaking
and
he
made
his
promise
good
forthwith
by
forwarding
to
her
a
package
of
books
on
art
among
them
two
volumes
of
ruskin
selma
who
had
read
quotations
from
ruskin
on
one
or
two
occasions
and
believed
herself
an
admirer
of
and
tolerably
familiar
with
his
writings
was
thrilled
she
promptly
immersed
herself
in
stones
of
venice
and
seven
lamps
of
architecture
sitting
up
late
at
night
to
finish
them
when
she
had
read
these
and
the
article
in
the
encyclopædia
under
the
head
of
art
she
felt
bursting
with
her
subject
and
eager
to
air
her
knowledge
before
the
class
her
lecture
was
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
stirring
and
thorough
of
the
course
reports
of
its
success
came
back
to
her
from
littleton
who
offered
to
assist
his
pupil
further
by
practical
demonstration
of
the
eternal
architectural
fitness
and
unfitness
of
things
especially
the
latter
in
walks
through
the
streets
of
benham
but
six
times
in
as
many
months
however
there
was
no
suggestion
of
coquetry
on
either
side
in
these
excursions
yet
each
enjoyed
them
littleton
own
work
was
beginning
to
assume
definite
form
and
his
visits
to
benham
became
of
necessity
more
frequent
flying
trips
but
he
generally
managed
to
obtain
a
few
words
with
selma
he
continued
to
lend
her
books
and
he
invited
her
criticism
on
the
slowly
growing
church
edifice
the
responsibility
of
critic
was
an
absorbing
sensation
to
her
but
the
stark
glibness
of
tongue
which
stood
her
in
good
stead
before
the
classes
of
the
institute
failed
her
in
his
presence
the
presence
of
real
knowledge
she
wished
to
praise
but
to
praise
discriminatingly
with
the
cant
of
æsthetic
appreciation
so
that
he
should
believe
that
she
knew
as
for
the
church
itself
she
was
interested
in
it
it
was
fine
of
course
but
that
was
a
secondary
consideration
compared
with
her
emotions
his
predilection
in
her
favor
however
readily
made
him
deaf
in
regard
to
her
utterances
he
scarcely
heeded
her
halting
solemn
counterfeit
transcendentalisms
or
rather
they
passed
muster
as
subtle
and
genuine
so
spell
bound
was
he
by
the
delphic
beauty
of
her
criticising
expression
it
was
enough
for
him
to
watch
her
as
she
stood
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
the
worried
archangel
look
transfiguring
her
profile
what
she
said
was
lost
in
his
reverie
as
to
what
she
was
what
she
represented
in
his
contemplation
as
she
looked
upon
his
handiwork
he
was
able
to
view
it
with
different
eyes
to
discern
its
weaknesses
and
to
gain
fresh
inspiration
from
her
presence
he
felt
that
it
was
growing
on
his
hands
and
that
he
should
be
proud
of
it
and
though
perhaps
he
was
conscious
in
his
inner
soul
that
she
was
more
to
him
than
another
man
wife
should
be
he
knew
too
that
no
word
or
look
of
his
had
offended
against
the
absent
husband
chapter
vi
by
the
end
of
another
six
months
littleton
work
was
practically
completed
only
the
finishing
touches
to
the
interior
decoration
remained
to
be
done
the
members
of
rev
glynn
congregation
including
hallett
taylor
were
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
the
new
church
it
was
attractive
in
its
lines
yet
it
was
simple
and
consequently
in
keeping
with
the
resources
of
the
treasury
there
was
no
large
bill
for
extras
to
be
audited
as
possibly
would
have
been
the
case
had
a
designer
like
pierce
been
employed
the
committee
felt
itself
entitled
to
the
congratulations
of
the
community
nor
was
the
community
on
the
whole
disposed
to
grumble
for
home
talent
had
been
employed
by
the
architect
under
rigorous
supervision
to
be
sure
so
that
poor
material
and
workmanship
were
out
of
the
question
still
payments
had
been
prompt
and
benham
was
able
to
admire
competent
virtue
the
church
was
a
monument
of
suggestion
in
various
ways
artistic
and
ethical
and
it
shone
neatly
with
babcock
varnish
one
morning
selma
set
forth
by
agreement
with
littleton
in
order
to
inspect
some
fresco
work
muriel
grace
was
ailing
slightly
but
as
she
would
be
home
by
she
bade
the
hired
girl
be
watchful
of
baby
and
kept
her
appointment
the
child
had
grown
dear
to
her
for
muriel
was
a
charming
little
dot
and
selma
had
already
begun
to
enjoy
the
maternal
delight
of
human
doll
dressing
an
extravagance
in
which
she
was
lavishly
encouraged
by
her
husband
babcock
was
glad
of
any
excuse
to
spend
money
on
his
daughter
who
seemed
to
him
from
day
to
day
a
greater
marvel
of
precocity
such
a
child
as
became
selma
beauty
and
cleverness
and
his
own
practical
selma
was
in
a
pensive
frame
of
mind
this
morning
two
days
before
she
had
read
a
paper
at
the
institute
on
motherhood
which
had
been
enthusiastically
received
earle
had
printed
a
flattering
item
concerning
it
in
the
it
was
agreeable
to
her
to
be
going
to
meet
littleton
for
he
was
the
most
interesting
masculine
figure
in
her
life
she
was
sure
of
lewis
he
was
her
husband
and
she
knew
herself
to
be
the
apple
of
his
eye
but
she
knew
exactly
what
he
was
going
to
say
before
he
said
it
and
much
of
what
he
said
grated
on
her
she
was
almost
equally
sure
of
littleton
that
is
of
his
admiration
his
companionship
was
a
constant
pleasure
to
her
as
a
married
woman
and
as
a
christian
and
american
woman
she
desired
no
more
than
this
but
on
the
other
hand
she
would
fain
have
this
admiring
companionship
continue
and
yet
it
could
not
littleton
had
told
her
the
day
before
that
he
was
going
back
to
new
york
and
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
return
she
would
miss
him
she
would
have
the
institute
and
earle
still
but
her
life
would
be
less
full
littleton
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
church
entrance
she
followed
him
down
the
nave
to
the
chancel
where
she
listened
dreamily
to
his
presentation
of
the
merits
of
the
new
decoration
he
seemed
inclined
to
talk
and
from
this
presently
branched
off
to
describe
with
enthusiasm
the
plates
of
a
french
book
on
interior
architecture
which
he
had
recently
bought
as
a
but
triumphant
piece
of
extravagance
mechanically
they
turned
from
the
chancel
and
slowly
made
the
round
of
the
aisles
a
short
silence
succeeded
his
professional
ardor
his
current
of
thought
in
its
reversion
to
home
matters
had
reminded
him
afresh
of
what
was
perpetually
this
morning
uppermost
in
his
consciousness
his
coming
departure
now
he
said
abruptly
is
the
most
favorable
opportunity
i
shall
have
babcock
to
tell
you
how
much
i
am
your
debtor
i
despair
of
our
meeting
again
for
the
world
is
small
and
good
friends
are
sure
to
meet
sooner
or
later
but
the
past
is
secure
to
me
at
any
rate
if
this
church
is
in
some
measure
what
i
have
dreamed
and
wished
it
to
be
if
my
work
with
all
its
faults
is
a
satisfaction
to
myself
i
wish
you
to
know
how
much
you
have
contributed
to
make
it
what
it
is
the
words
were
as
a
melody
in
selma
ears
and
she
listened
greedily
littleton
paused
as
one
seriously
moved
will
pause
before
giving
the
details
of
an
important
announcement
she
thinking
he
had
finished
interjected
with
a
touch
of
modesty
i
so
glad
but
my
suggestions
and
criticisms
have
not
been
what
i
meant
them
to
be
it
was
all
new
to
me
you
know
oh
yes
it
has
been
so
much
what
you
have
said
in
words
which
has
helped
me
though
that
has
been
always
intelligent
and
uplifting
i
did
not
look
for
technical
knowledge
you
do
not
possess
that
of
course
there
are
women
in
new
york
who
would
be
able
to
confuse
you
with
their
familiarity
with
these
things
and
yet
it
is
by
way
of
contrast
with
those
very
women
fine
women
too
in
their
way
that
you
have
been
my
good
angel
there
is
no
harm
in
saying
that
i
should
be
an
ingrate
surely
if
i
would
not
let
you
know
that
your
sane
simple
outlook
upon
life
your
independent
vision
has
kept
my
brain
clear
and
my
soul
free
i
am
a
better
artist
and
a
better
man
for
the
experience
and
may
all
happiness
attend
you
if
once
in
a
while
you
should
find
time
to
write
to
a
struggling
architect
named
littleton
he
will
be
charmed
to
do
your
bidding
to
send
you
books
and
to
place
his
professional
knowledge
at
your
service
he
held
out
his
hand
with
frank
effusion
he
was
obviously
happy
at
having
given
utterance
to
his
sense
of
obligation
selma
was
tingling
from
head
to
foot
and
a
womanly
blush
was
on
her
cheek
though
the
serious
seraph
spoke
in
her
words
and
eyes
she
felt
moved
to
a
wave
of
unreserved
speech
what
you
have
said
is
very
interesting
to
me
i
wish
to
tell
you
how
much
i
too
have
enjoyed
our
friendship
the
first
time
we
met
i
felt
sure
we
should
be
sympathetic
and
we
have
been
have
we
one
of
the
fine
things
about
friendships
between
men
and
women
in
this
country
is
that
they
can
really
get
to
know
each
other
without
er
harm
to
either
is
it
it
such
a
pleasure
to
know
people
really
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
really
i
never
known
any
man
exactly
in
that
way
and
i
have
always
wanted
to
except
of
course
my
husband
and
he
extremely
different
that
is
his
tastes
are
not
like
yours
it
a
happiness
to
me
to
feel
that
i
have
been
of
assistance
to
you
in
your
work
and
you
have
been
equally
helpful
to
me
in
mine
as
you
say
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
the
technical
parts
of
art
and
your
books
have
instructed
me
as
to
that
i
have
never
been
in
new
york
but
i
understand
what
you
meant
about
your
friends
those
other
women
i
suppose
society
people
must
be
constantly
diverted
from
serious
work
from
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
life
oh
yes
we
ought
to
write
our
friendship
must
languish
we
must
let
each
other
know
what
we
are
thinking
and
doing
as
selma
walked
along
the
street
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
she
felt
pity
for
herself
to
just
the
right
person
she
would
have
confessed
the
discovery
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
tied
herself
for
life
to
the
wrong
man
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
fancied
littleton
which
distressed
her
for
indeed
she
was
but
mildly
conscious
of
infatuation
what
disturbed
her
was
the
contrast
between
him
and
babcock
which
definite
separation
now
forced
upon
her
attention
an
indefinable
impression
that
littleton
might
think
less
of
her
if
she
were
to
state
this
soul
truth
had
restrained
her
at
the
last
moment
from
disclosing
the
secret
not
for
an
instant
did
she
entertain
the
idea
of
being
false
to
lewis
her
confession
would
have
been
but
a
dissertation
on
the
inexorable
irony
of
fate
calling
only
for
sympathy
and
in
no
way
derogating
from
her
dignity
and
as
a
wife
still
she
had
restrained
herself
and
stopped
just
short
of
the
confidence
he
was
gone
and
she
would
probably
not
see
him
again
for
years
that
was
endurable
indeed
a
recognition
of
the
contrary
would
not
have
seemed
to
her
consistent
with
wifely
virtue
what
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
was
the
vision
of
continued
wedlock
until
death
intervened
with
a
husband
who
could
not
understand
could
she
bear
this
must
she
endure
it
there
was
but
one
answer
she
must
at
the
thought
she
bit
her
lip
with
the
intensity
and
sternness
of
a
martyr
she
would
be
faithful
to
her
marriage
vows
but
she
would
not
let
lewis
low
aims
interfere
with
the
free
development
of
her
own
life
it
was
after
noon
when
she
reached
home
she
was
met
at
the
door
by
the
hired
girl
with
the
worried
ejaculation
that
baby
was
choking
the
doctor
was
hastily
summoned
he
at
once
pronounced
that
muriel
grace
had
membranous
croup
and
was
desperately
ill
remedies
of
various
sorts
were
tried
and
a
consulting
physician
called
but
when
babcock
returned
from
his
office
her
condition
was
evidently
hopeless
the
child
died
in
the
early
night
selma
was
relieved
to
hear
the
doctor
tell
her
husband
that
it
was
a
malignant
case
from
the
first
and
that
nothing
could
have
averted
the
result
in
response
to
questions
from
lewis
however
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
she
had
not
been
at
home
when
the
acute
symptoms
appeared
this
afforded
babcock
an
outlet
for
his
suffering
he
spoke
to
her
roughly
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
bitterly
suggesting
neglect
on
her
part
you
knew
she
was
all
right
this
morning
yet
you
had
to
go
with
that
architect
instead
of
staying
at
home
where
you
belonged
and
now
she
dead
my
little
girl
my
little
girl
and
the
big
man
burst
out
sobbing
selma
grew
deadly
pale
no
one
had
ever
spoken
to
her
like
that
before
in
her
life
to
the
horror
of
her
grief
was
added
the
consciousness
that
she
was
being
unjustly
dealt
with
lewis
had
heard
the
statement
and
yet
he
dared
address
her
in
such
terms
as
if
the
loss
of
the
child
did
not
fall
equally
on
her
if
it
were
to
be
done
over
again
i
should
do
just
the
same
she
answered
with
righteous
quietness
to
all
appearances
she
had
nothing
but
a
little
cold
you
have
no
right
to
lay
the
blame
on
me
her
mother
at
the
last
word
she
looked
ready
to
cry
too
babcock
regarded
her
like
a
miserable
tame
bull
i
did
mean
to
he
blubbered
she
taken
away
from
me
and
i
so
wretched
that
i
know
what
i
saying
i
sorry
selma
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
she
was
ready
to
go
to
them
for
the
angel
of
death
had
entered
her
home
and
pierced
her
heart
where
it
should
be
most
tender
she
loved
her
baby
yet
when
she
had
time
to
think
she
was
not
sure
that
she
wished
to
have
another
when
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
had
passed
away
that
was
the
hope
which
lewis
ventured
to
express
at
first
in
a
whisper
and
later
with
reiterated
boldness
selma
acquiesced
externally
but
she
had
her
own
opinions
certain
things
which
were
not
included
in
mother
lore
had
been
confided
by
margaret
rodney
earle
by
word
of
mouth
in
the
fulness
of
their
mutual
and
had
remained
for
future
reference
in
selma
inner
consciousness
another
baby
just
at
this
time
meant
interference
with
everything
elevating
there
was
time
enough
in
a
year
or
two
when
she
had
established
herself
more
securely
in
the
social
sphere
of
benham
she
would
present
her
husband
with
a
second
child
it
was
best
for
them
both
to
wait
for
her
success
was
his
success
but
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
make
that
clear
to
him
in
his
present
mood
so
she
put
away
her
baby
things
dropping
tears
over
the
little
socks
and
other
reminders
of
her
sorrow
and
took
up
her
life
again
keeping
her
own
counsel
the
sympathy
offered
her
was
an
interesting
experience
earle
came
to
her
at
once
and
took
her
to
her
bosom
taylor
sent
her
flowers
with
a
kind
note
which
set
selma
thinking
whether
she
ought
not
to
buy
mourning
and
within
a
week
she
received
a
visit
of
condolence
from
glynn
rather
a
ghastly
visit
ghastly
because
lewis
sat
through
it
all
with
red
eyes
very
much
as
though
he
were
listening
to
a
touching
exhortation
in
church
to
be
sure
he
gripped
the
pastor
hand
like
a
vice
at
the
end
and
thanked
him
for
coming
but
his
silent
afflicted
presence
had
interfered
with
the
free
interchange
of
thought
which
would
have
been
possible
had
she
been
alone
with
the
clergyman
the
subject
of
death
and
the
whole
train
of
reflections
incident
to
it
were
uppermost
in
her
mind
and
she
would
have
been
glad
to
probe
the
mysteries
of
the
subject
by
controversial
argument
instead
of
listening
to
hearty
sonorous
platitudes
she
listened
rather
contemptuously
for
she
recognized
that
glynn
was
saying
the
stereotyped
thing
in
the
stereotyped
way
without
realizing
that
it
was
nothing
but
sacerdotal
pap
little
adapted
to
an
intelligent
soul
what
was
suited
to
lewis
was
not
fit
for
her
and
yet
her
death
had
served
to
dissipate
somewhat
the
immediate
discontent
which
she
felt
with
her
husband
his
strong
grief
had
touched
her
in
spite
of
herself
and
though
she
blamed
him
still
for
his
inconsiderate
accusation
she
was
fond
of
him
as
she
might
have
been
fond
of
some
loving
newfoundland
which
splendid
in
awkward
bulk
caressed
her
and
licked
her
hand
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
be
in
his
arms
for
the
touch
of
man
even
the
wrong
man
was
at
times
a
comfort
she
took
up
again
with
determined
interest
her
relations
to
the
institute
joining
additional
classes
and
pursuing
a
variety
of
topics
of
study
in
regard
to
some
of
which
she
consulted
littleton
she
missed
his
presence
less
than
she
had
expected
especially
after
they
had
begun
to
correspond
and
were
able
to
keep
in
touch
by
letter
his
letters
were
delightful
they
served
her
in
her
lecture
courses
for
they
so
clearly
and
concisely
expressed
her
views
that
she
was
able
to
use
long
extracts
from
them
word
for
word
and
every
now
and
then
they
contained
a
respectful
allusion
which
showed
that
he
still
retained
a
personal
interest
in
her
so
the
weeks
slipped
away
and
she
was
reasonably
happy
she
was
absorbed
and
there
was
nothing
new
to
mar
the
tenor
of
her
life
though
she
was
vaguely
conscious
that
the
loss
of
their
little
girl
had
widened
the
breach
between
her
and
her
husband
widened
it
for
the
reason
that
now
for
the
first
time
he
perceived
how
lonely
he
was
the
baby
had
furnished
him
with
constant
delight
and
preoccupation
he
had
looked
forward
all
day
to
seeing
it
at
night
and
questions
relating
to
it
had
supplied
a
small
change
of
conversation
between
him
and
her
he
had
let
her
go
her
way
with
a
smile
on
his
face
selma
did
not
choose
to
dwell
on
the
situation
but
it
was
obvious
that
lewis
continued
to
look
glum
and
that
there
were
apt
to
be
long
silences
between
them
at
meals
now
and
again
he
would
show
some
impatience
at
the
continuous
recurrence
of
the
institute
classes
as
a
bar
to
some
project
of
domesticity
or
recreation
as
though
she
had
not
been
an
active
member
of
the
institute
before
baby
was
born
one
of
the
plans
in
which
earle
was
most
interested
was
a
congress
of
women
clubs
and
in
the
early
summer
of
the
same
year
some
four
months
subsequent
to
the
death
of
muriel
grace
a
small
beginning
toward
this
end
was
arranged
to
take
place
in
chicago
there
were
to
be
six
delegates
from
each
club
and
selma
was
unanimously
selected
as
one
of
the
delegation
from
the
benham
women
institute
the
opinion
was
generally
expressed
that
a
change
would
do
her
good
and
there
was
no
question
that
she
was
admirably
fitted
to
represent
the
club
selma
who
had
not
travelled
a
hundred
miles
beyond
benham
in
her
life
was
elated
at
the
prospect
of
the
expedition
so
much
so
that
she
proudly
recounted
to
lewis
the
same
evening
the
news
of
her
appointment
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
would
wish
to
accompany
her
and
when
he
presently
informed
her
that
he
had
been
wishing
to
go
to
chicago
on
business
for
some
time
and
that
the
date
proposed
would
suit
him
admirably
she
was
dumfounded
half
of
the
interest
of
the
expedition
would
consist
in
travelling
as
an
independent
delegation
a
husband
would
be
in
the
way
and
spoil
the
savor
of
the
occasion
it
would
never
do
and
so
selma
proceeded
to
explain
she
wished
to
go
alone
a
pack
of
six
women
travel
by
themselves
blurted
lewis
suppose
there
were
an
accident
he
added
after
searching
his
brain
for
a
less
feeble
argument
we
should
either
be
killed
or
we
should
be
said
selma
firmly
we
are
perfectly
well
able
to
take
care
of
ourselves
women
travel
alone
everywhere
that
is
intelligent
american
women
lewis
looked
a
little
sad
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
seem
nice
for
you
to
go
with
me
selma
we
have
been
off
since
we
were
married
and
i
can
get
away
now
just
as
well
as
not
so
it
would
have
been
if
i
were
one
of
the
delegation
i
should
think
you
would
see
lewis
that
your
coming
is
out
of
the
question
so
it
proved
selma
set
forth
for
chicago
on
the
appointed
day
made
many
new
acquaintances
among
the
delegates
and
was
pleased
to
be
introduced
and
referred
to
publicly
as
selma
babcock
a
form
of
address
to
which
she
was
unaccustomed
at
benham
on
the
night
before
her
departure
being
in
pleasant
spirits
she
told
lewis
that
her
absence
would
do
him
good
and
that
he
would
appreciate
her
all
the
more
on
her
return
she
was
to
be
gone
a
week
the
first
hours
passed
gloomily
for
babcock
then
he
began
to
take
notice
he
noticed
that
the
county
fair
was
fixed
for
the
following
days
he
had
hoped
to
carry
selma
there
but
as
she
was
not
to
be
had
it
seemed
to
him
sensible
to
get
what
enjoyment
from
it
he
could
alone
then
it
happened
that
a
former
companion
of
his
bachelor
days
and
his
bachelor
habits
a
commercial
traveller
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
marriage
appeared
on
the
scene
the
very
man
for
me
he
ejaculated
jubilantly
the
obscurity
of
this
remark
was
presently
made
clear
to
his
friend
who
had
hoped
perhaps
to
enjoy
a
snug
evening
at
babcock
domestic
hearth
but
who
was
not
averse
to
playing
a
different
part
that
of
cheering
up
a
father
who
had
lost
his
baby
and
whose
wife
had
left
him
in
the
lurch
he
assured
babcock
that
a
regular
old
time
outing
a
shaking
up
would
do
him
good
and
babcock
was
ready
to
agree
with
him
intending
thereby
a
two
days
at
the
fair
as
has
been
intimated
his
manner
of
life
before
marriage
had
not
been
irreproachable
but
he
had
been
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
put
an
end
to
the
mildly
riotous
and
coarse
bouts
which
disfigured
his
otherwise
commonplace
existence
he
had
no
intention
now
of
misbehaving
himself
but
he
felt
the
need
of
being
enlivened
his
companion
was
a
man
who
delighted
in
what
he
called
a
lark
and
whose
only
method
of
insuring
a
lark
was
by
starting
in
with
whiskey
and
keeping
it
up
that
had
been
also
babcock
former
conception
of
a
good
time
and
though
he
had
dimly
in
mind
that
he
was
now
a
husband
and
he
strove
to
conduct
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
maintain
his
without
becoming
a
spoil
sport
during
the
first
day
at
the
fair
babcock
managed
to
preserve
this
nice
distinction
on
the
second
he
lost
account
of
his
conduct
and
by
the
late
afternoon
was
sauntering
with
his
friend
among
the
booths
in
the
company
of
two
suspicions
looking
women
with
these
same
women
the
pair
of
revellers
drove
off
in
top
buggies
just
before
dusk
and
vanished
in
the
direction
of
the
open
country
chapter
vii
babcock
returned
to
his
home
hours
later
like
a
whipped
cur
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
that
he
should
have
fallen
so
low
he
had
sinned
against
his
wife
and
his
own
without
excuse
for
it
was
no
excuse
that
he
had
let
himself
be
led
to
drink
too
much
his
heart
ached
and
his
cheek
burned
at
the
recollection
of
his
two
days
of
debauchery
what
was
to
be
done
if
only
he
were
able
to
cut
this
ugly
sore
in
his
soul
out
with
a
knife
and
have
done
with
it
forever
but
that
was
impossible
it
stared
him
in
the
face
a
haunting
reality
in
his
distress
he
asked
himself
whether
he
would
not
go
to
glynn
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
but
his
practical
instincts
answered
him
that
he
would
none
the
less
have
made
a
beast
of
himself
he
held
his
head
between
his
hands
and
stared
dejectedly
at
his
desk
some
relief
came
to
him
at
last
only
from
the
reflection
that
it
was
a
single
fault
and
that
it
need
never
it
should
never
be
repeated
selma
need
not
know
and
he
would
henceforth
avoid
all
such
temptations
terrible
as
it
was
it
was
a
slip
not
a
deliberate
fault
and
his
love
for
his
wife
was
not
in
question
thus
reasoning
he
managed
by
the
third
day
after
his
return
to
reach
a
less
despondent
frame
of
mind
while
busy
writing
in
his
office
a
lady
was
announced
and
looking
up
he
encountered
the
meretricious
smile
of
the
courtesan
with
whom
he
had
forgotten
himself
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
victim
and
having
learned
that
he
was
well
to
do
she
had
come
in
order
to
establish
if
possible
on
a
more
permanent
basis
her
relations
with
him
she
was
a
young
woman
who
had
been
drifting
from
place
to
place
and
whose
professional
inclination
for
a
protector
was
heightened
by
the
liking
which
she
had
conceived
for
him
babcock
recalled
in
her
smile
merely
his
shame
and
regarded
her
reappearance
as
effrontery
he
was
blind
to
her
prettiness
and
her
sentimental
mood
he
asked
her
roughly
what
she
wanted
and
rising
from
his
chair
he
bade
her
be
gone
before
she
had
time
to
answer
nine
out
of
ten
women
of
her
class
would
have
taken
their
dismissal
lightly
some
might
have
answered
back
in
tones
loud
enough
to
enlighten
the
clerks
and
thus
have
accomplished
a
pretty
revenge
in
the
course
of
retreat
this
particular
lesbian
was
in
no
humor
to
be
harshly
treated
she
was
a
little
desperate
and
babcock
had
pleased
her
it
piqued
her
to
be
treated
in
such
a
fashion
accordingly
she
held
her
ground
and
sat
down
she
tried
upon
him
alternately
irony
and
pathos
he
was
angry
but
confused
under
the
first
he
became
savage
and
merciless
under
the
second
throwing
back
in
her
teeth
the
suggestion
of
her
fondness
and
stigmatizing
her
coarsely
then
she
became
angry
in
her
turn
angry
as
a
woman
whose
proffered
love
is
spurned
the
method
for
revenge
was
obvious
and
she
told
him
plainly
what
she
intended
his
wife
should
know
at
once
how
her
husband
passed
his
time
during
her
absence
she
had
posted
herself
and
she
saw
that
her
shaft
hurt
babcock
winced
but
mad
and
incredulous
he
threatened
her
with
arrest
and
drove
her
from
the
room
she
went
out
smiling
but
with
an
ominous
look
in
her
eyes
the
remembrance
of
which
made
him
ask
himself
now
and
again
if
she
could
be
vicious
enough
or
fool
enough
to
keep
her
promise
he
dismissed
the
idea
as
improbable
still
the
bare
chance
worried
him
selma
was
to
arrive
early
the
next
morning
and
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
the
conclusion
that
she
need
never
know
and
that
he
would
henceforth
be
a
faithful
husband
had
he
not
given
an
earnest
of
his
good
faith
in
his
reception
of
his
visitor
surely
no
such
untoward
and
unnatural
accident
would
dash
the
cup
of
returning
happiness
from
his
lips
a
more
clever
man
would
have
gone
straight
to
police
headquarters
instead
of
trusting
to
chance
a
night
rest
reassured
him
as
to
the
idleness
of
the
threat
so
that
he
was
able
to
welcome
selma
at
the
railroad
station
with
a
comparatively
light
heart
she
was
in
high
spirits
over
the
success
of
her
expedition
and
yet
graciously
ready
to
admit
that
she
was
glad
to
return
home
meaning
thereby
to
her
own
bed
and
bathing
facilities
but
the
general
term
seemed
to
poor
lewis
a
declaration
of
wifely
devotion
he
went
to
his
business
with
the
mien
of
a
man
who
had
passed
through
an
ordeal
and
is
beginning
life
again
but
when
he
returned
at
night
as
soon
as
he
beheld
selma
he
suspected
what
had
happened
she
was
awaiting
him
in
the
parlor
though
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
looked
grave
he
went
forward
to
kiss
her
but
she
rose
and
stepping
behind
the
table
put
out
her
hand
forbiddingly
what
is
the
matter
he
faltered
that
woman
has
been
here
was
her
slow
scornful
response
selma
i
a
confusing
sense
of
hopelessness
as
to
what
to
say
choked
babcock
attempt
to
articulate
there
was
a
brief
silence
while
he
looked
at
her
imploringly
and
miserably
is
it
true
what
she
says
have
you
been
false
to
your
marriage
vows
have
you
committed
adultery
my
god
selma
you
do
understand
it
is
an
easy
question
to
answer
yes
or
no
i
forgot
myself
selma
i
was
drunk
and
crazy
i
ask
your
pardon
she
shook
her
head
coldly
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
i
can
not
live
with
you
any
longer
not
live
with
me
would
you
live
with
me
if
it
were
i
who
had
forgotten
myself
i
think
i
would
selma
you
do
understand
i
was
a
brute
i
have
been
wretched
ever
since
but
it
was
a
slip
an
accident
i
drank
too
much
and
it
happened
i
love
you
selma
with
all
my
heart
i
have
never
been
false
to
you
in
my
affection
it
is
a
strange
time
to
talk
of
affection
i
went
away
for
a
week
and
in
my
absence
you
insulted
me
by
debauchery
with
a
creature
like
that
love
you
have
no
conception
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
oh
no
i
shall
never
live
with
you
again
babcock
clinched
his
palms
in
his
distress
and
walked
up
and
down
she
stood
pale
and
determined
looking
into
space
presently
he
turned
to
her
and
asked
with
quiet
but
intense
solicitude
you
do
mean
that
going
to
leave
me
for
one
fault
we
being
husband
and
wife
and
the
little
girl
in
her
grave
i
said
you
do
understand
and
you
do
a
man
a
man
and
there
are
times
when
he
been
drinking
when
liable
to
yield
to
temptation
and
that
though
he
so
fond
of
his
wife
that
life
without
her
would
be
misery
this
sounds
strange
to
a
woman
and
it
a
poor
excuse
but
it
ought
to
count
selma
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
our
separating
there
would
be
happy
years
before
us
yet
if
you
give
me
another
chance
not
happy
years
for
me
she
replied
concisely
the
american
woman
does
not
choose
to
live
with
the
sort
of
man
you
describe
she
demands
from
her
husband
what
he
demands
from
her
faithfulness
to
the
marriage
tie
we
could
never
be
happy
again
our
ideal
of
life
is
different
i
have
made
excuses
for
you
in
other
things
but
my
soul
revolts
at
this
babcock
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
said
a
little
sternly
you
should
have
gone
away
and
left
me
i
not
blaming
you
but
you
should
have
gone
he
walked
to
the
window
but
he
saw
nothing
his
heart
was
racked
he
had
been
eager
to
humiliate
himself
before
her
to
prove
his
deep
contrition
but
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
resources
and
yet
she
was
adamant
her
charge
that
she
had
been
making
excuses
for
him
hitherto
reminded
him
that
they
had
not
been
really
sympathetic
for
some
time
past
with
his
back
turned
to
her
he
heard
her
answer
it
was
understood
before
i
agreed
to
marry
you
that
i
was
to
be
free
to
follow
my
tastes
and
interests
it
is
a
paltry
excuse
that
because
i
left
you
alone
for
a
week
in
pursuit
of
them
i
am
accessory
to
your
sin
babcock
faced
her
sadly
the
sin
all
mine
he
said
i
ca
deny
that
but
selma
i
guess
i
been
pretty
lonely
ever
since
the
baby
died
lonely
she
echoed
then
my
leaving
you
will
not
matter
so
much
here
she
said
slipping
off
her
this
belongs
to
you
she
remembered
earle
proceeding
and
though
she
had
not
yet
decided
what
course
to
pursue
in
order
to
maintain
her
liberty
she
regarded
this
as
the
significant
and
definite
act
she
held
out
the
ring
but
babcock
shook
his
head
the
law
does
work
as
quick
as
that
nor
the
church
either
you
can
get
a
divorce
if
you
set
on
it
selma
but
we
husband
and
wife
yet
only
the
husk
of
our
marriage
is
left
the
spirit
is
dead
she
said
sententiously
i
am
going
away
i
can
not
pass
another
night
in
this
house
if
you
will
not
take
this
ring
i
shall
leave
it
here
babcock
turned
to
hide
the
tears
which
blinded
his
eyes
selma
regarded
him
a
moment
gravely
then
she
laid
her
on
the
table
and
went
from
the
room
she
put
her
immediate
belongings
into
a
bag
and
left
the
house
she
had
decided
to
go
to
earle
lodgings
where
she
would
be
certain
to
find
shelter
and
sympathy
were
she
to
go
to
her
aunt
she
would
be
exposed
to
importunity
on
her
husband
behalf
from
farley
who
was
partial
to
lewis
her
mind
was
entirely
made
up
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
reconciliation
her
duty
was
plain
and
she
would
be
doing
herself
an
injustice
were
she
to
continue
to
live
with
one
so
weak
and
regardless
of
the
honor
which
she
had
a
right
to
demand
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
her
society
and
her
body
his
gross
conduct
had
entitled
her
to
her
liberty
and
to
neglect
to
seize
it
would
be
to
condemn
herself
to
continuous
unhappiness
for
this
overt
act
of
his
was
merely
a
definite
proof
of
the
lack
of
sympathy
between
them
of
which
she
had
for
some
time
been
well
aware
at
heart
as
she
walked
along
the
street
she
was
conscious
that
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
be
sloughing
off
the
garment
of
an
uncongenial
relationship
and
to
be
starting
life
afresh
there
was
nothing
in
her
immediate
surroundings
from
which
she
was
not
glad
to
escape
their
house
was
full
of
blemishes
from
the
of
her
later
knowledge
and
she
yearned
to
dissociate
herself
once
and
for
all
from
the
trammels
of
her
pitiful
mistake
she
barely
entertained
the
thought
that
she
was
without
means
she
would
have
to
support
herself
of
course
but
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
doubt
her
ability
to
do
so
and
the
necessity
added
a
zest
to
her
decision
it
would
be
plain
sailing
for
earle
had
more
than
once
invited
her
to
send
copy
to
the
and
there
was
no
form
of
occupation
which
would
be
more
to
her
liking
than
newspaper
work
it
was
almost
with
the
mien
of
a
prisoner
escaped
from
jail
that
she
walked
in
upon
her
friend
and
said
i
have
left
my
husband
he
has
been
unfaithful
to
me
in
earle
conventional
feminine
instincts
were
apt
before
she
had
time
to
think
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
her
set
theories
you
poor
poor
child
she
cried
extending
her
arms
selma
had
not
intended
to
weep
still
the
opportunity
was
convenient
and
her
nerves
were
on
edge
she
found
herself
sobbing
with
her
head
on
earle
bosom
and
telling
her
sad
story
he
was
never
good
enough
for
you
i
have
always
said
so
earle
murmured
stroking
her
hair
i
ought
to
have
known
from
the
first
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
be
happy
why
did
i
ever
marry
him
he
said
he
loved
me
and
i
let
myself
be
badgered
into
it
selma
answered
through
her
tears
well
it
all
over
now
she
added
sitting
up
and
drying
her
eyes
he
has
given
me
back
my
liberty
i
am
a
free
woman
yes
dear
if
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
yourself
there
is
only
one
course
to
pursue
only
you
should
consider
the
matter
solemnly
perhaps
in
a
few
days
after
he
has
apologized
and
shown
proper
contrition
you
might
feel
willing
to
give
him
another
chance
selma
was
unprepared
for
earle
sentimentality
surely
she
exclaimed
with
tragic
earnestness
you
would
have
me
live
with
him
after
what
occurred
contrition
he
said
everything
he
could
think
of
to
get
me
to
stay
but
i
made
my
decision
then
and
there
earle
put
her
own
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
women
have
forgiven
such
things
but
i
respect
you
all
the
more
for
not
being
weak
i
know
how
you
feel
it
is
hard
to
do
but
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
i
would
act
just
the
same
just
the
same
it
a
serious
responsibility
to
encourage
any
one
to
desert
a
home
but
under
the
circumstances
i
would
not
live
with
him
another
minute
my
child
not
another
minute
thereupon
earle
protruded
her
bosom
to
celebrate
the
triumph
of
justice
in
her
own
mental
processes
over
conventional
and
maudlin
scruples
you
will
apply
for
a
divorce
i
suppose
i
have
not
considered
that
all
i
care
for
is
never
to
see
him
again
oh
yes
you
must
get
a
divorce
it
is
much
better
you
know
in
my
case
i
could
for
he
did
nothing
public
a
divorce
settles
matters
and
puts
you
back
where
you
were
before
you
might
wish
some
day
to
marry
again
i
have
had
enough
of
marriage
it
is
any
harm
to
be
a
free
woman
free
in
the
eye
of
the
law
as
well
as
of
conscience
i
know
an
excellent
lawyer
a
lyons
a
sympathetic
and
able
man
besides
your
husband
is
bound
to
support
you
you
must
get
alimony
i
would
touch
a
dollar
of
his
money
selma
answered
with
scorn
i
intend
to
support
myself
i
shall
write
work
of
course
you
will
dear
and
it
will
be
a
boon
and
a
blessing
to
me
to
have
you
in
our
ranks
one
of
the
new
army
of
women
i
suppose
you
are
right
i
have
never
had
a
sixpence
but
your
husband
deserves
to
be
punished
perhaps
it
is
punishment
enough
to
lose
you
he
will
get
over
that
it
is
enough
for
me
she
exclaimed
ardently
after
a
dreamy
pause
that
i
am
separated
from
him
forever
that
i
am
free
free
free
a
night
sleep
served
to
intensify
selma
determination
and
she
awoke
clearly
of
the
opinion
that
a
divorce
was
desirable
why
remain
fettered
by
a
bare
legal
tie
to
one
who
was
a
husband
only
in
name
accordingly
in
company
with
earle
she
visited
the
office
of
james
lyons
and
took
the
initiatory
steps
to
dissolve
the
marriage
lyons
was
a
large
man
of
with
a
fat
cherubic
countenance
an
aspect
of
candor
and
keen
solemn
eyes
his
manner
was
impressive
and
slightly
pontificial
his
voice
resonant
and
engaging
he
knew
when
to
joke
and
when
to
be
grave
as
an
owl
he
wore
in
life
a
shiny
black
a
standing
collar
which
yawned
at
the
throat
and
a
narrow
black
tie
his
general
effect
was
that
of
a
cross
between
a
parson
and
a
shrewd
yankee
a
happy
suggestion
of
righteous
plain
protected
against
the
wiles
of
human
society
and
able
to
protect
others
by
a
canny
intelligence
for
a
young
man
he
had
already
a
considerable
clientage
a
certain
class
of
people
notably
the
felt
themselves
safe
in
his
hands
his
magnetic
yet
grave
manner
of
conducting
business
pleased
benham
attracting
also
both
the
distressed
and
the
bilious
portions
of
the
community
and
the
farmers
from
the
surrounding
country
as
earle
informed
selma
he
was
in
sympathy
with
all
progressive
and
stimulating
ideas
and
he
already
figured
in
the
newspapers
politically
and
before
the
courts
as
a
friend
of
the
masses
and
a
fluent
advocate
of
social
reforms
his
method
of
handling
selma
case
was
smooth
to
begin
with
he
was
sympathetic
within
proper
limits
giving
her
tacitly
to
understand
that
though
as
a
man
and
brother
he
deplored
the
necessity
of
extreme
measures
he
recognized
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
that
compromise
was
out
of
the
question
to
put
it
concisely
his
manner
was
grieved
but
practical
he
told
her
that
he
would
represent
to
babcock
the
futility
of
contesting
a
cause
which
on
the
evidence
must
be
hopeless
and
that
in
all
probability
the
matter
could
be
disposed
of
easily
and
without
publicity
he
seemed
to
selma
a
very
sensible
and
capable
man
and
it
was
agreeable
to
her
to
feel
that
he
appreciated
that
though
divorce
in
the
abstract
was
deplorable
her
experience
justified
and
called
for
the
protection
of
the
law
in
the
meantime
babcock
was
very
unhappy
and
was
casting
about
for
a
method
to
induce
his
wife
to
return
he
wrote
to
her
a
pitiful
letter
setting
forth
once
more
the
sorry
facts
in
the
best
light
which
he
could
bring
to
bear
on
them
and
implored
her
forgiveness
he
applied
to
her
aunt
farley
and
got
her
to
supplement
his
plea
with
her
intervention
there
are
lots
of
men
like
that
she
confided
to
selma
and
he
a
kind
devoted
creature
when
this
failed
he
sought
rev
glynn
as
a
last
resort
and
after
he
had
listened
to
a
stern
and
fervid
rating
from
the
clergyman
on
the
lust
of
the
flesh
he
found
his
pastor
on
his
side
glynn
was
opposed
to
divorce
on
general
ecclesiastical
principles
moreover
he
had
been
educated
under
the
law
of
england
by
which
a
woman
can
not
obtain
a
divorce
from
her
husband
for
the
cause
of
adultery
unless
it
be
coupled
with
cruelty
a
clever
distinction
between
the
sexes
which
was
doubtless
intended
as
a
cloak
for
occasional
lapses
on
the
part
of
man
it
was
plain
to
him
as
a
christian
and
as
a
hearty
soul
that
there
had
been
an
untoward
accident
a
bestial
fault
a
carnal
sin
but
still
an
accident
and
hence
to
be
forgiven
by
god
and
woman
it
was
his
duty
to
interfere
and
so
having
disciplined
the
husband
he
essayed
the
more
delicate
matter
of
propitiating
the
wife
and
he
essayed
it
without
a
thought
of
failure
i
afraid
she
determined
to
leave
me
and
that
there
not
much
hope
said
babcock
despondently
as
he
gripped
the
clergyman
hand
in
token
of
his
gratitude
nonsense
my
man
asserted
glynn
briskly
all
she
needs
is
an
exhortation
from
me
and
she
will
take
you
back
selma
was
opposed
to
divorce
in
theory
that
is
she
had
accepted
on
trust
the
traditional
prejudice
against
it
as
she
had
accepted
shakespeare
and
boston
but
theory
stood
for
nothing
in
her
regard
before
the
crying
needs
of
her
own
experience
she
had
not
the
least
intention
of
living
with
her
husband
again
no
one
could
oblige
her
to
do
that
in
addition
the
law
offered
her
a
formal
escape
from
his
control
and
name
why
not
avail
herself
of
it
she
recollected
besides
that
her
husband
church
recognized
infidelity
as
a
lawful
ground
of
release
from
the
sacrament
of
marriage
this
had
come
into
her
mind
as
an
additional
sanction
to
her
own
decision
but
it
had
not
contributed
to
that
decision
consequently
when
she
was
confronted
in
earle
lodgings
by
the
errand
of
glynn
she
felt
that
his
coming
was
superfluous
still
she
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
measure
ideas
with
him
in
a
thorough
interview
free
from
interruption
glynn
confidence
was
based
on
his
intention
to
appeal
to
the
ever
womanly
quality
of
pity
he
expected
to
encounter
some
resistance
for
indisputably
here
was
a
woman
whose
sensibilities
had
been
justly
and
severely
shocked
a
woman
of
finer
tissue
than
her
husband
as
he
had
noted
in
other
american
couples
she
was
entitled
to
her
day
in
court
to
a
stubborn
righteous
respite
of
indignation
but
he
expected
to
carry
the
day
in
the
end
amid
a
rush
of
tears
with
which
his
own
might
be
mingled
he
trusted
to
what
he
regarded
as
the
innate
reluctance
of
the
wife
to
abandon
the
man
she
loved
and
to
the
leaven
of
feminine
christian
charity
as
a
conscientious
hater
of
sin
he
did
not
attempt
to
minimize
babcock
act
or
the
insult
put
upon
her
that
done
he
was
free
to
intercede
fervently
for
him
and
to
extol
the
virtue
and
the
advisability
of
forgiveness
this
plea
however
cogent
was
narrow
and
once
stated
admitted
merely
of
duplication
in
the
same
form
it
was
indeed
no
argument
merely
an
appeal
and
in
proportion
as
it
failed
to
move
the
listener
became
feeble
selma
listened
to
him
with
a
tense
face
her
hands
clasped
before
her
in
the
guise
of
an
interested
and
spirit
but
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
yielding
or
symptom
of
doubt
she
shook
her
head
once
or
twice
as
he
proceeded
and
when
he
paused
asked
why
she
should
return
to
a
man
who
had
broken
faith
with
her
asked
it
in
such
a
genuine
tone
of
conviction
that
glynn
realized
the
weakness
of
his
own
case
and
became
slightly
nettled
at
the
same
time
true
he
said
rather
sternly
your
husband
has
committed
a
hideous
carnal
sin
but
he
is
genuinely
repentant
do
you
wish
to
ruin
his
life
forever
his
life
said
selma
it
would
ruin
my
life
to
return
to
him
i
have
other
plans
plans
which
will
bring
me
happiness
i
could
never
be
happy
with
him
the
clergyman
was
baffled
other
plans
the
words
offended
him
and
yet
he
could
not
dispute
her
right
to
do
as
she
chose
still
he
saw
fit
to
murmur
he
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
selma
flushed
to
be
accused
of
acting
contrary
to
christian
precepts
was
painful
and
surprising
to
her
glynn
she
said
i
see
you
do
understand
my
husband
and
i
ought
never
to
have
married
it
has
all
been
a
dreadful
mistake
we
have
not
the
same
tastes
and
interests
i
am
sorry
for
him
but
i
can
never
consent
to
return
to
him
to
do
so
would
condemn
us
both
to
a
life
of
unhappiness
we
were
not
intended
for
husband
and
wife
and
it
is
best
yes
more
christian
for
us
to
separate
we
american
women
do
not
feel
justified
in
letting
a
mistake
ruin
our
lives
when
there
is
a
chance
to
escape
glynn
regarded
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
he
was
accustomed
to
convince
and
he
had
not
succeeded
which
to
a
clergyman
is
more
annoying
than
to
most
men
still
what
she
said
made
his
plea
seem
doubtful
wisdom
then
you
do
not
love
your
husband
he
said
no
said
selma
quietly
i
do
not
love
him
it
is
best
to
be
frank
with
one
self
with
you
in
such
a
matter
is
it
so
you
see
that
what
you
ask
is
out
of
the
question
glynn
rose
clearly
his
mission
had
failed
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
being
a
just
man
he
hesitated
to
pass
an
unkind
judgment
on
this
pensive
woman
she
was
within
her
moral
rights
and
he
must
be
careful
to
keep
within
his
but
he
went
away
bewildered
and
discomfited
selma
would
have
liked
to
dismiss
the
subject
and
keep
him
longer
she
would
have
been
glad
to
branch
off
on
to
other
ethical
topics
and
discuss
them
she
was
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
interview
for
she
had
vindicated
her
position
and
spiked
lewis
last
gun
so
indeed
it
proved
glynn
sent
for
babcock
and
told
him
the
naked
truth
that
his
wife
love
for
him
was
dead
and
reconciliation
impossible
he
properly
refrained
from
expressing
the
doubt
lurking
in
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
selma
had
ever
loved
her
husband
thus
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
his
predicament
babcock
agreed
to
lyons
suggestion
not
to
contest
the
legal
proceedings
the
lawyer
had
been
diligent
and
the
necessary
evidence
the
testimony
of
the
woman
was
secure
she
was
ready
to
carry
her
revenge
to
the
end
hoping
perhaps
that
the
victim
of
it
would
return
to
her
when
he
had
lost
his
wife
accordingly
a
few
weeks
later
selma
was
granted
a
divorce
nisi
and
the
right
to
resume
her
maiden
name
she
had
decided
however
to
retain
the
badge
of
marriage
as
a
decorous
social
prefix
and
to
call
herself
selma
white
chapter
viii
the
consciousness
that
she
was
dependent
for
the
means
of
support
solely
on
her
own
exertions
was
a
genuine
pleasure
to
selma
and
she
applied
herself
with
confidence
and
enthusiasm
to
the
problem
of
earning
her
livelihood
she
had
remained
steadfast
to
her
decision
to
accept
nothing
from
her
husband
except
the
legal
costs
of
the
proceedings
though
lyons
explained
to
her
that
alimony
was
a
natural
and
moral
increment
of
divorce
still
after
her
refusal
he
informed
her
as
a
man
and
a
friend
that
he
respected
and
admired
the
independence
of
her
action
which
was
an
agreeable
tribute
she
had
fixed
definitely
on
newspaper
work
as
the
most
inviting
and
congenial
form
of
occupation
she
believed
herself
to
be
well
fitted
for
it
it
would
afford
her
an
immediate
income
and
it
would
give
her
the
opportunity
which
she
craved
for
giving
public
expression
to
her
ideas
and
fixing
attention
on
herself
there
was
room
for
more
than
one
earle
in
benham
for
benham
was
growing
and
and
on
the
alert
for
originality
of
any
kind
especially
in
the
way
of
reportorial
and
journalistic
cleverness
selma
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
second
earle
that
is
she
promised
herself
to
follow
but
not
to
follow
blindly
to
imitate
judiciously
but
to
improve
on
a
gradually
diverging
line
of
progress
this
was
mere
generalization
as
yet
it
was
an
agreeable
seething
brain
consciousness
for
future
development
for
the
moment
however
she
counted
on
earle
to
obtain
for
her
a
start
by
personal
influence
at
the
office
of
the
this
was
provided
forthwith
in
the
form
of
an
invitation
to
prepare
a
weekly
column
under
the
caption
of
what
women
wear
a
summary
of
passing
usages
in
clothes
the
woman
reporter
in
charge
of
it
had
just
died
selma
first
impulse
was
to
decline
the
work
as
unworthy
of
her
abilities
yet
she
was
in
immediate
need
of
employment
to
avoid
running
in
debt
and
she
was
assured
by
earle
that
she
would
be
very
foolish
to
reject
such
an
offer
reflection
caused
her
to
think
more
highly
of
the
work
itself
it
would
afford
her
a
chance
to
explain
to
the
women
of
benham
and
indirectly
to
the
country
at
large
that
taste
in
dress
was
not
necessarily
inconsistent
with
virtue
and
serious
intentions
a
truth
of
which
she
herself
had
become
possessed
since
her
marriage
and
which
it
seemed
to
her
might
be
utilized
delightfully
in
her
department
she
would
endeavor
to
treat
dress
from
the
standpoint
of
ethical
responsibility
to
society
and
to
show
that
both
extravagance
and
dowdy
homeliness
were
to
be
avoided
clothes
in
themselves
had
grown
to
be
a
satisfaction
to
her
and
any
association
of
vanity
would
be
eliminated
by
the
introduction
of
a
serious
artistic
purpose
into
a
weekly
commentary
concerning
them
accordingly
she
accepted
the
position
and
entered
upon
its
duties
with
grave
zeal
for
each
of
these
contributions
selma
was
to
receive
eight
dollars
four
hundred
a
year
which
she
hoped
to
expand
to
a
thousand
by
creative
literary
production
preferably
essays
and
poetry
she
hired
a
room
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
earle
in
the
district
appurtenant
to
central
avenue
that
is
to
say
on
the
ragged
edge
of
benham
social
artery
and
set
up
her
new
household
gods
the
interest
of
preparing
the
first
paper
absorbed
her
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
she
visited
all
the
and
establishments
in
town
examined
at
a
hint
from
earle
the
fashion
departments
of
the
new
york
papers
and
then
pen
in
hand
gave
herself
up
to
her
subject
the
result
seemed
to
her
a
happy
blending
of
timely
philosophy
and
suggestions
as
to
toilette
and
she
took
it
in
person
to
the
editor
he
saw
fit
to
read
it
on
the
spot
his
brow
wrinkled
at
first
and
he
looked
dubious
he
it
and
said
with
some
gusto
it
a
novelty
but
i
guess
they
like
it
our
women
readers
have
been
used
to
fashion
notes
which
are
crisp
and
to
the
point
and
the
big
houses
expect
to
have
attention
called
to
the
goods
they
wish
to
sell
if
you
run
over
this
again
and
set
your
cold
facts
in
little
paragraphs
by
themselves
every
now
and
then
i
should
wonder
if
the
rest
were
a
sort
of
lecture
course
which
will
catch
them
it
a
good
idea
next
time
you
could
work
in
a
pathetic
story
some
references
to
a
dead
baby
verses
anecdotes
a
little
variety
you
perceive
the
idea
oh
yes
said
selma
appropriately
sober
at
the
allusion
yet
ecstatic
that
just
what
i
should
like
to
do
it
would
give
me
more
scope
i
wish
my
articles
to
be
of
real
use
to
help
people
to
live
better
and
to
dress
better
that
right
that
right
and
if
they
make
the
paper
sell
we
know
that
folks
like
them
responded
the
editor
with
delphic
urbanity
the
first
article
was
a
success
that
is
selma
method
was
not
interfered
with
and
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
reading
in
the
during
the
week
an
item
calling
gratified
attention
to
the
change
in
its
what
women
wear
column
and
indicating
that
it
would
contain
new
features
from
week
to
week
it
gave
her
a
pleasant
thrill
to
see
her
name
selma
white
signed
at
the
end
of
the
printed
column
and
she
set
to
work
eagerly
to
carry
out
the
editor
suggestions
at
the
same
time
she
tried
her
hand
at
a
short
story
the
story
of
an
american
girl
who
went
to
paris
to
study
art
refused
to
alter
her
mode
of
life
to
suit
foreign
ideas
of
female
propriety
displayed
exceptional
talent
as
an
artist
and
finally
married
a
young
american
to
the
utter
discomfiture
of
a
french
member
of
the
nobility
who
had
begun
by
insulting
her
and
ended
with
making
her
an
offer
of
marriage
this
she
sent
to
the
the
other
benham
newspaper
for
its
sunday
edition
it
took
her
a
month
to
compose
this
story
and
after
a
week
she
received
it
back
with
a
memorandum
to
the
effect
that
it
was
too
long
but
intimating
that
in
a
revised
form
it
would
be
acceptable
this
was
a
little
depressing
especially
as
it
arrived
at
a
time
when
the
novelty
of
her
occupation
had
worn
off
and
she
was
realizing
the
limitations
of
her
present
life
she
had
begun
to
miss
the
advantages
of
a
free
purse
and
the
importance
of
a
domestic
establishment
she
possessed
her
liberty
and
was
fulfilling
her
mission
as
a
social
force
but
her
life
had
been
deprived
of
some
of
its
savor
and
though
she
was
thankful
to
be
rid
of
babcock
she
felt
the
lack
of
an
element
of
personal
devotion
to
herself
an
element
which
was
not
to
be
supplied
by
mere
admiration
on
the
part
of
earle
and
the
other
members
of
the
institute
it
did
not
suit
her
not
to
be
able
to
gratify
her
growing
taste
in
clothes
and
in
other
lines
of
expenditure
and
there
were
moments
when
she
experienced
the
need
of
being
petted
and
made
much
of
by
a
man
she
was
conscious
of
loneliness
and
in
this
mood
she
pitied
herself
as
a
victim
of
untoward
circumstances
one
who
had
wasted
the
freshness
of
her
young
life
and
missed
the
happiness
which
the
american
wife
is
apt
to
find
waiting
for
her
under
the
spell
of
this
nostalgia
she
wrote
a
poem
entitled
the
bitter
sweets
of
solitude
and
disposed
of
it
for
five
dollars
to
the
the
price
shocked
her
for
the
verses
seemed
flesh
of
her
flesh
still
five
dollars
was
better
than
nothing
and
she
discerned
from
the
manner
of
the
newspaper
editor
that
he
cared
little
whether
she
left
them
or
not
it
was
on
that
evening
that
she
received
a
letter
from
littleton
stating
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
leaving
new
york
for
benham
he
was
coming
to
consult
concerning
certain
further
interior
decorations
which
the
committee
had
decided
to
add
to
the
church
selma
nerves
vibrated
blissfully
as
she
read
the
news
for
some
reason
which
she
had
never
seen
fit
definitely
to
define
she
had
chosen
not
to
acquaint
littleton
with
the
fact
of
her
divorce
their
letters
had
been
infrequent
during
the
last
six
months
for
this
visit
had
been
impending
having
been
put
off
from
time
to
time
because
the
committee
had
been
dilatory
and
he
otherwise
engaged
perhaps
her
secret
motive
had
been
to
surprise
him
to
let
him
find
himself
confronted
with
an
accomplished
fact
which
would
obviate
argument
and
reveal
her
established
in
her
new
career
a
happy
independent
citizen
without
ties
at
any
rate
she
smiled
now
at
the
address
on
the
envelope
lewis
babcock
obviously
he
was
still
in
the
dark
as
to
the
truth
and
it
would
be
her
privilege
to
enlighten
him
she
began
to
wonder
what
would
be
the
upshot
of
his
coming
and
tears
came
to
her
eyes
tears
of
that
the
narrow
tenor
of
her
daily
life
was
to
be
irradiated
by
a
sympathetic
spirit
when
littleton
duly
appeared
at
the
committee
meeting
on
the
following
day
selma
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
unaware
of
what
had
happened
he
looked
slightly
puzzled
when
one
of
the
members
addressed
her
as
white
but
evidently
he
regarded
this
as
a
slip
of
the
tongue
selma
looked
as
she
felt
contented
and
vivacious
she
had
dressed
herself
simply
but
with
effective
trigness
to
those
who
knew
her
experience
her
appearance
indicated
courage
and
becoming
public
opinion
even
as
embodied
in
the
church
committee
while
deploring
the
necessity
was
not
disposed
to
question
the
propriety
of
her
action
that
is
all
except
taylor
in
her
selma
thought
she
had
detected
signs
of
coldness
a
sort
of
suspicious
reservation
of
judgment
which
contrasted
itself
unpleasantly
with
the
sympathetic
attitude
of
the
others
who
were
fain
to
refer
to
her
in
not
altogether
muffled
whispers
as
a
plucky
independent
little
woman
hence
she
was
glad
that
taylor
happened
to
be
detained
at
home
by
illness
on
this
afternoon
and
that
accordingly
she
was
free
to
enjoy
unreservedly
the
dramatic
nature
of
the
situation
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
the
chairman
turning
to
her
to
ask
a
question
addressed
her
unmistakably
as
white
she
could
not
refrain
from
casting
sheep
eyes
at
littleton
he
started
visibly
regarded
her
for
a
moment
in
obvious
amazement
then
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
she
felt
the
blood
rising
to
her
own
cheeks
and
a
sensation
of
mild
triumph
the
meeting
was
over
and
the
members
were
merely
lingering
to
tie
up
the
loose
threads
of
the
matter
arranged
for
in
a
few
moments
selma
found
herself
with
the
architect
sufficiently
apart
from
the
others
for
him
to
ask
two
persons
have
addressed
you
this
afternoon
as
white
i
do
not
understand
she
cast
down
her
eyes
as
a
woman
will
when
a
question
of
modesty
is
involved
then
she
raised
them
and
said
you
did
not
know
then
that
i
had
left
my
husband
left
him
yes
i
have
obtained
a
divorce
he
was
unfaithful
to
me
i
see
said
littleton
with
a
sort
of
gasp
i
see
i
did
not
know
you
never
wrote
to
me
i
did
not
feel
like
writing
to
any
body
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
that
littleton
regarded
her
with
a
perturbed
restless
air
then
you
live
no
longer
at
onslow
avenue
oh
no
i
left
there
more
than
six
months
ago
i
live
in
lodgings
i
am
supporting
myself
by
literary
work
i
am
selma
white
now
and
my
divorce
has
been
absolute
more
than
a
month
she
spoke
gravely
and
quietly
with
less
than
her
usual
assurance
for
she
felt
the
spell
of
his
keen
eager
scrutiny
and
was
not
averse
to
yield
at
the
moment
to
the
propensity
of
her
sex
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
about
did
he
blame
her
did
he
sympathize
with
her
where
are
you
going
when
you
leave
here
he
asked
home
to
my
new
home
will
you
walk
along
with
me
that
is
what
i
should
like
i
am
astonished
by
what
you
have
told
me
and
am
anxious
to
hear
more
about
it
if
to
speak
of
it
would
not
wound
you
divorced
how
you
must
have
suffered
and
i
did
not
have
the
chance
to
offer
you
my
help
my
sympathy
yes
i
have
suffered
but
that
is
all
over
now
i
am
a
free
woman
i
am
beginning
my
life
over
again
it
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
and
by
mutual
consent
which
neither
put
into
words
they
diverged
from
the
exact
route
to
selma
lodging
house
and
turned
their
steps
to
the
open
country
beyond
the
city
limits
the
picturesque
dell
which
has
since
become
the
site
of
benham
public
park
there
they
seated
themselves
where
they
would
not
be
interrupted
selma
told
him
on
the
way
the
few
vital
facts
in
her
painful
story
to
which
he
listened
in
a
tense
silence
broken
chiefly
by
an
occasional
ejaculation
expressive
of
his
contempt
for
the
man
who
had
brought
such
unhappiness
upon
her
she
let
him
understand
too
that
her
married
life
from
the
first
had
been
far
less
happy
than
he
had
imagined
wretched
makeshift
for
the
true
relation
of
husband
and
wife
she
spoke
of
her
future
buoyantly
yet
with
a
touch
of
sadness
as
though
to
indicate
that
she
was
aware
that
the
triumphs
of
intelligence
and
individuality
could
not
entirely
be
a
substitute
for
a
happy
home
and
what
do
you
expect
to
do
he
inquired
in
a
bewildered
fashion
as
though
her
delineation
of
her
hopes
had
been
lost
on
him
do
support
myself
by
my
own
exertions
as
i
have
told
you
by
writing
i
expect
i
am
doing
very
well
already
do
you
question
my
ability
to
continue
oh
no
not
that
only
only
what
surely
you
are
not
one
of
the
men
who
grudge
women
the
chance
to
prove
what
is
in
them
who
would
treat
us
like
china
dolls
and
circumscribe
us
by
conventions
i
know
you
are
not
because
i
have
heard
you
inveigh
against
that
very
sort
of
narrow
mindedness
only
what
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
it
and
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that
it
means
so
much
to
me
that
you
mean
so
much
to
me
what
is
the
use
of
my
dodging
the
truth
selma
seeking
to
conceal
it
because
such
a
short
time
has
elapsed
since
you
ceased
to
be
a
wife
forgive
me
if
i
hurt
you
if
it
seem
indelicate
to
speak
of
love
at
the
very
moment
when
you
are
happy
in
your
liberty
i
ca
help
it
it
my
nature
to
speak
openly
and
there
no
bar
now
the
fact
that
you
are
free
makes
clear
to
me
what
i
have
not
dared
to
countenance
before
that
you
are
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
the
woman
i
have
dreamed
of
and
longed
to
meet
the
woman
whose
influence
has
blessed
me
already
and
without
whom
i
shall
lack
the
greatest
happiness
which
life
can
give
selma
i
love
you
i
adore
you
selma
listened
with
greedy
ears
which
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
in
so
unexpected
yet
entrancing
was
his
avowal
she
had
been
vaguely
aware
that
he
admired
her
more
than
he
had
allowed
himself
to
disclose
and
conscious
too
that
his
presence
was
agreeable
to
her
but
in
an
instant
now
she
recognized
that
this
was
love
the
love
she
had
sought
the
love
she
had
yearned
to
inspire
and
to
feel
compared
with
it
babcock
clumsy
ecstasy
and
her
own
sufferance
of
it
had
been
a
sham
and
a
delusion
of
so
much
she
was
conscious
in
a
twinkling
and
yet
what
she
deemed
proper
restrained
her
from
casting
herself
into
his
arms
it
was
indeed
soon
and
she
had
been
happy
in
her
liberty
at
least
she
had
supposed
herself
so
and
she
owed
it
to
her
own
plans
and
hopes
not
to
act
hastily
though
she
knew
what
she
intended
to
do
she
had
been
lonely
yes
starving
for
lack
of
true
companionship
and
here
was
the
soul
which
would
be
a
true
mate
to
hers
they
were
sitting
on
a
grassy
bank
he
was
bending
toward
her
with
clasped
hands
a
picture
of
fervor
she
could
see
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
glance
though
she
looked
into
space
with
her
gaze
of
seraphic
worry
yet
her
lips
were
ready
to
lend
themselves
to
a
smile
of
blissful
satisfaction
and
her
eyes
to
fill
with
the
melting
mood
of
the
thought
that
at
last
happiness
had
come
to
her
the
silence
was
very
brief
but
littleton
as
would
have
seemed
fitting
to
her
feared
lest
she
were
shocked
i
distress
you
he
said
forgive
me
listen
will
you
listen
selma
was
glad
to
listen
the
words
of
love
such
love
as
this
were
delicious
and
she
felt
she
owed
it
to
herself
not
to
be
won
too
easily
i
am
listening
she
answered
softly
with
the
voice
of
one
face
to
face
with
an
array
of
doubts
before
i
met
you
selma
woman
but
was
a
name
to
me
my
life
brought
me
little
into
contact
with
them
except
my
dear
sister
and
i
had
no
temptation
to
regret
that
i
could
not
support
a
wife
yet
i
dreamed
of
woman
and
of
love
and
of
a
joy
which
might
some
day
come
to
me
if
i
could
meet
one
who
fulfilled
my
ideal
of
what
a
true
woman
should
be
so
i
dreamed
until
i
met
you
the
first
time
i
saw
you
selma
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
you
were
a
woman
whom
i
could
love
perhaps
i
should
have
recognized
more
clearly
as
time
went
on
that
you
were
more
to
me
even
then
than
i
had
a
right
to
allow
yet
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
did
not
by
word
or
sign
do
a
wrong
to
him
who
has
done
such
a
cruel
wrong
to
you
never
by
word
or
sign
echoed
selma
solemnly
the
bare
suggestion
that
babcock
had
cause
to
complain
of
either
of
them
seemed
to
her
preposterous
yet
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
he
had
loved
her
from
the
first
and
since
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
must
i
should
i
in
justice
to
myself
to
my
own
hopes
of
happiness
refrain
from
speaking
merely
because
you
have
so
recently
been
divorced
i
must
speak
i
am
speaking
it
is
too
soon
i
dare
say
for
you
to
be
willing
to
think
of
marriage
again
but
i
offer
you
the
love
and
protection
of
a
husband
my
means
are
small
but
i
am
able
now
to
support
a
wife
in
decent
comfort
selma
give
me
some
hope
tell
me
that
in
time
you
may
be
willing
to
trust
yourself
to
my
love
you
wish
to
work
to
distinguish
yourself
would
i
be
a
hindrance
to
that
indeed
you
must
know
that
i
would
do
every
thing
in
my
power
to
promote
your
desire
to
be
of
service
to
the
world
the
time
for
her
smile
and
her
tears
had
come
he
had
argued
his
case
and
her
own
and
it
was
clear
to
her
mind
that
delay
would
be
futile
since
happiness
was
at
hand
why
not
grasp
it
as
for
her
work
he
need
not
interfere
with
that
and
after
all
now
that
she
had
tried
it
was
she
so
sure
that
newspaper
work
hack
work
such
as
she
was
pursuing
was
what
she
wished
as
a
wife
in
the
security
of
a
home
she
could
pick
and
choose
her
method
of
expression
perhaps
indeed
it
would
not
be
writing
except
occasionally
was
not
new
york
a
wide
fruitful
field
for
a
reforming
social
influence
she
saw
herself
in
her
mind
eye
a
leader
of
movements
and
of
progress
and
that
with
a
man
she
loved
yes
adored
even
as
he
adored
her
so
she
turned
to
littleton
with
her
smile
and
in
tears
the
image
of
bewitching
but
pathetic
and
surrender
her
mind
was
made
up
hence
why
procrastinate
and
coyly
postpone
the
desirable
and
the
inevitable
that
was
what
she
had
the
shrewdness
to
formulate
in
the
ecstasy
of
her
transport
and
so
eloquent
was
the
mute
revelation
of
her
love
that
littleton
diffident
reverencer
of
the
modesty
of
woman
as
he
was
without
a
word
from
her
clasped
her
to
his
breast
a
victor
in
a
breath
as
regardless
of
the
possible
invasion
of
interlopers
he
took
her
in
his
embrace
she
felt
with
satisfaction
once
more
the
grasp
of
masculine
arms
she
let
her
head
fall
on
his
shoulder
in
delighted
contentment
while
he
murmured
in
succession
inarticulate
terms
of
endearment
she
revelled
in
the
thrill
of
her
nerves
and
approved
her
own
sagacious
and
commendable
behavior
dearest
she
whispered
you
are
right
we
are
right
since
we
love
each
other
why
should
we
not
say
so
i
love
you
i
love
you
the
ugly
hateful
past
shall
not
keep
us
apart
longer
you
say
you
loved
me
from
the
first
so
did
i
love
you
though
i
did
not
know
it
then
we
were
meant
for
each
other
god
meant
us
did
he
not
it
is
right
and
we
shall
be
so
happy
wilbur
yes
selma
words
seemed
to
him
an
inadequate
means
for
expressing
his
emotions
he
pressed
his
lips
upon
hers
with
the
adoring
respect
of
a
worshipper
touching
his
god
yet
with
the
energy
of
a
man
she
sighed
and
compared
him
in
her
thought
with
babcock
how
gentle
this
new
lover
how
refined
and
sensitive
and
appreciative
how
intelligent
and
gentlemanly
if
i
had
my
wish
darling
he
said
we
should
be
married
and
i
would
carry
you
away
from
here
forever
she
remembered
that
babcock
had
uttered
the
same
wish
on
the
occasion
when
he
had
offered
himself
to
grant
it
then
had
been
out
of
the
question
to
do
so
now
would
be
convenient
a
prompt
and
satisfactory
blotting
out
of
her
past
and
present
life
a
happy
method
of
solving
many
minor
problems
of
ways
and
means
connected
with
waiting
to
be
married
besides
it
would
be
romantic
and
a
delicious
fitting
crowning
of
her
present
blissful
mood
he
mistook
her
silence
for
womanly
scruples
and
he
recounted
with
a
little
laugh
the
predicament
in
which
he
should
find
himself
on
his
own
account
were
they
to
be
so
precipitate
what
would
my
sister
think
if
she
were
to
get
a
telegram
expect
us
she
would
think
i
had
lost
my
senses
so
i
have
darling
and
you
are
the
cause
she
knows
about
you
i
have
talked
to
her
about
you
but
she
thinks
i
am
mrs
babcock
oh
yes
ha
ha
it
would
never
do
to
state
to
whom
i
was
married
unless
i
sent
a
telegram
as
long
as
my
arm
dear
pauline
she
will
be
radiant
it
is
all
arranged
that
she
is
to
stay
where
she
is
in
the
old
quarters
and
i
am
to
take
you
to
a
new
house
we
decided
on
that
time
and
again
when
we
chanced
to
talk
of
what
might
happen
of
fair
the
chaste
and
unexpressive
she
my
she
dearest
i
wondered
if
i
should
ever
find
her
pauline
has
always
said
that
she
would
never
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
everything
by
living
with
us
it
would
be
very
nice
and
very
simple
responded
selma
slowly
you
would
think
any
the
worse
of
me
wilbur
if
i
were
to
marry
you
the
worse
of
you
it
is
what
i
would
like
of
all
things
whom
does
it
concern
but
us
why
should
we
wait
in
order
to
make
a
public
spectacle
of
ourselves
i
should
wish
that
i
should
insist
on
being
married
very
quietly
under
all
the
circumstances
there
is
really
no
reason
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
easier
if
we
were
to
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
it
would
avoid
explanations
and
talk
would
it
that
is
if
you
are
perfectly
sure
sure
that
i
love
you
oh
selma
she
shut
her
eyes
under
the
thrill
which
his
kiss
gave
her
then
we
will
be
married
whenever
you
wish
she
said
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
so
that
the
prospects
of
obtaining
a
license
did
not
seem
favorable
still
it
happened
that
littleton
knew
a
clergyman
of
his
own
faith
unitarian
in
benham
a
college
classmate
whom
he
suggested
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
selma
preferred
not
to
be
married
by
glynn
they
found
him
at
home
and
by
diligent
personal
effort
on
his
part
the
necessary
legal
forms
were
complied
with
and
they
were
made
husband
and
wife
three
hours
before
the
departure
of
the
evening
train
for
new
york
after
the
ceremony
they
stepped
buoyantly
arm
in
arm
in
the
dusk
along
the
street
to
send
the
telegram
to
miss
littleton
and
to
snatch
a
hasty
meal
before
selma
went
to
her
lodgings
to
pack
there
were
others
in
the
restaurant
so
having
discovered
that
they
were
not
hungry
they
bought
sandwiches
and
bananas
and
resumed
their
travels
the
suddenness
and
surprise
of
it
all
made
selma
feel
as
if
on
wings
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
of
the
essence
of
new
and
exquisite
romance
to
be
walking
at
the
side
of
her
fond
clever
lover
in
the
democratic
simplicity
of
two
paper
bags
of
provender
and
an
open
yet
almost
headlong
marriage
she
felt
that
at
last
she
was
yoked
to
a
spirit
who
comprehended
her
and
who
would
stimulate
instead
of
repress
the
fire
of
originality
within
her
she
had
found
love
and
she
was
happy
meanwhile
she
had
decided
to
leave
benham
without
a
word
to
anyone
even
earle
she
would
write
and
explain
what
had
happened
book
ii
the
struggle
chapter
littleton
had
not
expected
that
selma
would
accede
to
his
request
to
be
married
at
once
but
he
was
delighted
at
her
decision
he
had
uttered
his
wish
in
sincerity
for
there
was
really
no
reason
for
waiting
and
by
an
immediate
marriage
they
would
escape
the
tedium
of
an
engagement
during
which
they
could
hope
to
see
each
other
but
rarely
he
was
able
to
support
a
wife
provided
they
were
to
live
simply
and
economically
he
felt
sure
that
selma
understood
his
circumstances
and
was
no
less
ready
than
he
to
forego
luxuries
in
order
that
they
might
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
spiritually
as
husband
and
wife
besides
he
had
hopes
that
his
clientage
would
continue
to
grow
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
provide
all
reasonable
comforts
for
his
new
home
consequently
he
drove
up
from
the
station
in
new
york
with
a
light
heart
fondly
pointing
out
to
his
wife
this
and
that
building
and
other
objects
of
interest
he
mistook
her
pensive
silence
for
diffidence
at
the
idea
of
descending
suddenly
on
another
woman
home
a
matter
which
in
this
instance
gave
him
no
concern
for
he
had
unlimited
confidence
in
pauline
executive
ability
and
her
tendency
not
to
get
ruffled
she
had
been
his
good
angel
domestically
speaking
and
indeed
in
every
way
since
they
had
first
begun
to
keep
house
together
and
it
had
rather
amused
him
to
let
fall
such
a
bombshell
as
the
contents
of
his
telegram
upon
the
regularity
of
her
daily
life
do
be
nervous
darling
he
said
gayly
you
will
find
pauline
bubbling
over
with
joy
at
our
coming
and
everything
arranged
as
though
we
were
expected
to
live
there
all
our
lives
selma
looked
at
him
blankly
and
then
remembered
she
was
not
feeling
nervous
and
pauline
was
not
in
her
thoughts
she
had
been
lost
in
her
own
reflections
lost
in
the
happy
consciousness
of
the
contrast
between
her
new
and
her
old
husband
and
in
the
increasing
satisfaction
that
she
was
actually
in
new
york
how
bright
and
busy
the
streets
looked
the
throng
of
eager
passers
and
jostling
vehicles
against
the
background
of
brilliant
bewildered
and
stimulated
her
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
here
was
the
place
where
she
was
suited
to
live
and
mutely
acknowledging
its
superiority
to
benham
as
a
centre
of
life
this
was
a
rash
swift
conclusion
but
selma
prided
herself
on
her
capacity
to
arrive
at
wise
judgments
by
rapid
mental
processes
so
absorbed
was
she
in
the
glittering
stirring
panorama
that
wilbur
efforts
at
enlightenment
were
practically
wasted
she
was
in
no
humor
for
details
she
was
glorying
in
the
exalted
impression
which
the
whole
vivid
scene
produced
upon
her
his
remark
caused
her
to
realize
that
they
must
be
near
their
destination
she
had
no
misgivings
on
the
score
of
her
own
reception
but
she
was
interested
and
curious
to
see
pauline
this
wonderful
sister
of
whom
wilbur
was
so
fond
and
so
proud
then
her
husband
cried
here
we
are
and
in
another
moment
she
found
herself
in
the
hearty
embrace
of
a
large
comely
woman
who
met
her
at
the
door
this
of
course
must
be
pauline
selma
was
just
a
little
shocked
by
the
fervor
of
the
greeting
for
though
she
delighted
in
rapid
intimacies
unexpected
liberties
with
her
person
were
contrary
to
her
conceptions
of
propriety
still
it
was
delightful
to
be
welcomed
so
heartily
she
returned
the
embrace
warmly
but
with
dignity
and
allowed
herself
to
be
convoyed
into
the
house
arm
in
arm
with
her
new
relation
who
seemed
indeed
to
be
bubbling
over
with
joy
it
was
not
until
they
were
in
the
same
room
that
selma
could
get
a
good
look
at
her
pauline
littleton
was
fine
looking
rather
than
pretty
she
was
tall
and
substantial
with
an
agreeable
face
an
intelligent
brow
a
firm
yet
sweet
mouth
and
steady
honest
eyes
which
now
sparkled
with
pleasure
her
physique
was
very
different
from
her
brother
selma
noticed
that
she
was
taller
than
herself
and
only
a
little
shorter
than
wilbur
she
had
wilbur
smile
too
suggesting
a
disposition
to
take
things
humorously
but
her
expression
lacked
the
poetic
cast
which
made
him
so
attractive
and
congenial
to
herself
and
excused
the
existence
of
the
lighter
vein
selma
did
not
admire
women
who
were
inclined
to
be
stout
she
associated
spareness
of
person
with
high
thinking
and
an
abundance
of
flesh
as
an
indication
of
material
or
commonplace
aims
she
reflected
that
pauline
was
presumably
and
a
good
and
very
likely
an
industrious
teacher
in
her
classes
but
she
set
her
down
in
her
mind
as
deficient
in
the
finer
sensibilities
of
the
spirit
belonging
to
herself
and
wilbur
it
was
instinctive
with
selma
to
form
a
prompt
estimate
of
every
one
she
met
and
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
come
to
the
agreeable
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
appearance
to
make
her
discontented
with
herself
this
warmed
her
heart
at
once
toward
pauline
to
be
sure
pauline
manifested
the
same
sort
of
social
grace
which
distinguished
hallett
taylor
but
selma
though
she
still
regarded
this
with
suspicion
for
the
reason
that
she
had
not
yet
become
mistress
of
it
was
secretly
content
to
know
that
she
had
married
into
a
family
which
possessed
it
altogether
she
was
agreeably
impressed
by
her
scrutiny
of
her
new
sister
who
in
her
opinion
would
not
be
an
irritating
rival
either
in
looks
or
character
and
yet
who
was
a
pleasing
and
sufficiently
person
in
short
just
the
sort
of
which
she
yearned
to
have
pauline
on
her
part
was
duly
fascinated
by
the
delicate
and
inspiring
beauty
of
her
brother
wife
she
understood
at
once
why
wilbur
had
chosen
her
in
preference
to
any
one
of
his
own
circle
selma
obviously
symbolized
by
her
grave
tense
thin
face
the
serious
ideals
of
living
and
womanhood
which
had
been
dear
to
his
meditation
as
a
youth
and
a
part
of
his
heritage
from
his
new
england
ancestors
it
made
her
joyous
to
feel
that
he
had
found
a
wife
who
would
be
a
constant
source
of
inspiration
to
him
for
she
knew
that
wilbur
would
not
be
happy
with
any
one
who
fell
short
of
his
ideal
as
to
what
a
woman
should
be
she
knew
her
brother
well
and
she
understood
how
deeply
in
earnest
he
was
to
make
the
most
of
his
life
and
what
an
exalted
vision
he
entertained
as
to
the
possibilities
for
mutual
sympathy
and
help
between
husband
and
wife
partly
as
a
consequence
of
their
limited
means
partly
owing
to
absorption
in
their
respective
studies
and
interests
the
littletons
though
of
gentle
stock
lived
simple
lives
according
to
new
york
standards
they
were
aware
of
the
growth
of
luxury
resulting
from
the
accumulation
of
big
fortunes
since
the
war
as
an
architect
wilbur
saw
larger
and
more
elaborate
public
and
private
buildings
being
erected
on
every
side
as
a
and
a
woman
with
social
interests
pauline
knew
that
the
power
of
money
was
revolutionizing
the
public
taste
in
the
matter
of
household
expenditure
that
in
the
details
of
domestic
life
there
was
more
color
and
more
circumstance
and
that
people
who
were
and
many
who
were
not
were
requiring
as
daily
comforts
all
sorts
of
things
to
which
they
had
been
unaccustomed
but
though
they
both
thus
knew
vaguely
that
the
temper
of
society
had
changed
and
that
sober
citizens
and
their
wives
who
twenty
years
before
would
have
prated
solemnly
against
a
host
of
gay
enlivening
or
pretty
customs
as
incompatible
with
american
virtue
were
now
adopting
these
as
rapidly
as
money
could
procure
them
the
brother
and
sister
had
remained
comparatively
unaffected
by
the
consequences
of
the
transformation
scene
certainly
their
home
had
it
was
in
its
garniture
and
its
gentility
it
spoke
of
a
day
not
so
many
years
before
when
high
thinking
had
led
to
blinking
where
domestic
decoration
was
concerned
and
people
had
bought
ugly
wooden
and
worsted
things
to
live
with
because
only
the
things
of
the
spirit
seemed
of
real
importance
still
time
with
its
marvellous
touch
has
often
the
gift
of
making
furniture
and
upholstery
which
were
hideous
when
bought
look
interesting
and
cosey
when
they
have
become
in
this
way
pauline
wilbur
parlor
was
a
delightful
relic
of
a
day
gone
by
there
was
scarcely
a
pretty
thing
in
it
as
wilbur
himself
well
knew
yet
as
a
whole
it
had
an
atmosphere
an
atmosphere
of
simple
unaffected
refinement
their
domestic
belongings
had
come
to
them
from
their
parents
and
they
had
never
had
the
means
to
replenish
them
when
in
due
time
they
had
realized
their
artistic
worthlessness
they
had
held
to
them
through
affection
humorously
conscious
of
the
incongruity
that
two
such
modern
individuals
as
themselves
should
be
living
in
a
domestic
museum
then
presto
friends
had
begun
to
congratulate
them
on
the
uniqueness
of
their
establishment
and
to
express
affection
for
it
it
had
become
a
favorite
resort
for
many
modern
spirits
artists
literary
men
musicians
women
and
pauline
oyster
suppers
cooked
in
her
grandmother
blazer
were
still
a
stimulus
to
high
thinking
so
matters
stood
when
selma
entered
it
as
a
bride
her
coming
signified
the
breaking
up
of
the
household
and
the
establishment
pauline
had
thought
that
out
in
her
clear
brain
over
night
since
receiving
telegram
wilbur
must
move
into
a
modern
house
and
she
into
a
modern
flat
she
would
keep
the
very
old
things
such
as
the
blazer
and
some
andirons
and
a
pair
of
candlesticks
for
they
were
ancient
enough
to
be
really
artistic
but
the
furniture
of
the
immediate
past
her
father
and
mother
generation
should
be
sold
at
auction
wilbur
and
she
must
if
only
for
selma
sake
become
modern
in
material
matters
as
well
as
in
their
mental
interests
pauline
proceeded
to
unfold
this
at
the
that
evening
she
had
heard
in
the
meanwhile
from
her
brother
the
story
of
divorce
and
the
explanation
of
his
sudden
marriage
and
in
consequence
she
felt
the
more
solicitous
that
her
new
venture
should
begin
propitiously
it
was
agreed
that
wilbur
should
make
inquiries
at
once
about
houses
further
uptown
and
that
his
present
lease
from
year
to
year
should
not
be
renewed
she
said
to
selma
you
have
saved
us
from
becoming
an
bachelor
and
maid
our
friends
began
to
leave
this
neighborhood
five
years
ago
and
there
is
no
one
left
we
are
surrounded
by
and
shops
we
were
comfortable
and
we
were
too
busy
to
care
but
it
would
never
do
for
a
young
married
couple
to
begin
here
you
must
have
a
brand
new
house
uptown
selma
you
must
insist
on
that
do
be
alarmed
wilbur
i
know
it
will
have
to
be
small
but
i
noticed
the
other
day
several
blocks
of
new
houses
going
up
on
the
side
streets
west
of
the
park
which
looked
attractive
and
cheap
i
will
look
at
them
said
wilbur
since
you
seem
determined
not
to
live
with
us
and
we
are
obliged
to
move
we
will
follow
the
procession
but
selma
and
i
could
be
happy
anywhere
he
turned
from
his
sister
to
her
as
he
spoke
with
a
proud
happy
look
selma
said
nothing
to
mar
his
confidence
she
had
no
intention
of
living
either
with
pauline
or
in
their
present
house
and
she
felt
that
her
had
shown
good
sense
in
recognizing
that
neither
was
possible
she
necessarily
had
vague
ideas
as
to
new
york
houses
and
locations
but
she
had
seen
enough
in
her
drive
from
the
station
to
understand
that
it
was
a
wonderful
and
decorative
place
although
her
experience
of
benham
had
taught
her
that
some
old
things
such
as
hallett
taylor
gleanings
from
europe
were
desirable
she
associated
new
things
with
progress
especially
american
progress
consequently
the
littleton
household
possessions
had
puzzled
her
for
though
she
thought
them
ugly
she
was
resolved
not
to
commit
herself
too
hastily
but
now
that
pauline
had
sounded
a
note
of
warning
the
situation
was
clear
they
had
suffered
themselves
to
fall
behind
the
times
and
she
was
to
be
her
husband
good
angel
by
helping
him
to
catch
up
with
them
and
it
was
evident
that
pauline
would
be
her
ally
selma
for
the
first
time
asked
herself
whether
it
might
be
that
wilbur
was
a
little
visionary
meanwhile
he
was
saying
pauline
is
right
selma
i
had
already
asked
myself
if
it
would
not
be
fairer
to
you
to
move
uptown
where
we
should
be
in
the
van
and
in
touch
with
what
is
going
on
pauline
is
gently
hinting
to
you
that
you
must
not
humor
me
as
she
has
done
and
let
me
eat
bread
and
milk
out
of
a
bowl
in
this
old
curiosity
shop
instead
of
following
in
the
wake
of
fashion
she
has
spoiled
me
and
now
she
deserts
me
at
the
critical
moment
of
my
life
selma
you
shall
have
the
most
charming
modern
house
in
new
york
within
my
means
it
must
be
love
in
a
cottage
but
the
cottage
shall
have
the
latest
improvements
hot
and
cold
water
tiles
hygienic
plumbing
and
dados
bravo
said
pauline
he
says
i
have
spoiled
him
selma
perhaps
i
have
it
will
be
your
turn
now
you
will
fail
to
convert
him
as
i
have
failed
and
the
world
will
be
the
better
for
it
there
are
too
few
men
who
think
noble
thoughts
and
practice
them
who
are
true
to
themselves
and
the
light
which
is
in
them
through
thick
and
thin
but
you
see
he
admits
himself
that
he
needs
to
mix
with
the
world
a
little
more
otherwise
he
is
perfect
you
know
that
perhaps
already
selma
but
i
wish
to
tell
it
to
you
before
him
take
care
of
him
dear
wo
you
it
was
because
i
felt
that
his
thoughts
were
nobler
than
most
that
i
wished
to
marry
him
selma
replied
seraphically
but
i
can
see
that
it
is
sensible
to
live
where
your
friends
live
i
shall
try
not
to
spoil
him
pauline
she
was
already
conscious
of
a
mission
which
appealed
to
her
she
had
been
content
until
now
in
the
ardor
of
her
love
to
regard
wilbur
as
flawless
as
in
some
respects
superior
to
herself
but
it
was
a
gratification
to
her
to
detect
this
failing
and
to
perceive
her
opportunity
for
usefulness
surely
it
was
important
for
her
husband
to
be
progressive
and
not
merely
a
dreamer
littleton
looked
from
one
to
the
other
fondly
not
many
men
are
blessed
with
the
love
of
two
such
women
he
said
i
put
myself
in
your
hands
i
bow
my
neck
to
the
yoke
in
new
york
in
the
early
seventies
the
fashionable
quarter
lay
between
eighth
and
fortieth
streets
bounded
on
either
side
by
fourth
and
sixth
avenues
central
park
was
completed
but
the
region
west
of
it
was
from
the
social
still
a
wilderness
and
fifth
avenue
in
the
neighborhood
of
street
was
the
centre
of
elegant
social
life
selma
took
her
first
view
of
this
brilliant
street
on
the
following
day
on
her
way
to
hunt
for
houses
in
the
outlying
district
the
roar
and
bustle
of
the
city
which
thrilled
yet
dazed
her
seemed
here
softened
by
the
rows
of
tall
imposing
residences
in
brown
stone
along
the
sunny
sidewalks
passed
with
jaunty
tread
an
procession
of
stylishly
clad
men
and
women
and
along
the
roadbed
sped
an
array
of
private
carriages
conducted
by
coachmen
in
livery
it
was
a
brilliant
day
and
new
yorkers
were
making
the
most
of
it
selma
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
before
benham
faded
into
insignificance
in
comparison
she
was
excited
and
she
gazed
eagerly
at
the
spectacle
yet
her
look
though
absorbed
was
stern
this
sort
of
thing
was
unlike
anything
american
within
her
personal
experience
this
avenue
of
grand
houses
and
this
procession
of
fine
individuals
and
fine
vehicles
made
her
think
of
that
small
section
of
benham
into
which
she
had
never
been
invited
and
the
thought
affected
her
disagreeably
who
are
the
people
who
live
in
these
houses
she
asked
presently
littleton
had
already
told
her
that
it
was
the
most
fashionable
street
in
the
city
oh
the
rich
and
prosperous
those
who
gamble
in
stocks
i
suppose
selma
wished
to
be
assured
that
this
was
so
some
of
them
said
littleton
with
a
laugh
they
belong
to
people
who
have
made
money
in
various
ways
or
have
inherited
it
our
class
among
them
the
first
families
in
new
york
and
many
of
them
our
best
citizens
are
they
friends
of
yours
littleton
laughed
again
a
few
not
many
society
here
is
divided
into
sets
and
they
are
not
in
my
set
i
prefer
mine
and
fortunately
for
i
ca
afford
to
belong
to
theirs
oh
the
frigidity
and
dryness
of
the
exclamation
littleton
ascribed
to
selma
intuitive
enmity
to
the
vanities
of
life
you
must
pass
judgment
on
them
too
hastily
he
said
new
york
is
a
wonderful
place
and
it
likely
to
shock
you
before
you
learn
to
appreciate
what
is
interesting
and
fine
here
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
selma
every
one
likes
to
make
money
even
clergymen
feel
it
their
duty
to
accept
a
call
from
the
congregation
which
offers
the
best
salary
and
probing
men
of
science
do
not
hesitate
to
reap
the
harvest
from
a
wonderful
invention
yet
it
is
the
fashion
with
most
of
the
people
in
this
country
who
possess
little
to
prate
about
the
wickedness
of
and
to
think
evil
of
the
rich
that
proceeds
chiefly
from
envy
and
it
is
sheer
cant
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
engaged
in
an
eager
struggle
to
advance
themselves
to
gain
individual
distinction
comfort
success
and
in
new
york
to
a
greater
extent
than
in
any
other
place
can
the
capable
man
or
woman
sell
his
or
her
wares
to
the
best
advantage
be
they
what
they
may
stocks
merchandise
law
medicine
pictures
the
world
pays
well
for
the
things
it
wants
and
the
world
is
pretty
just
in
the
long
run
if
it
does
like
my
designs
that
will
be
because
they
not
worth
buying
the
great
thing
the
difficult
thing
to
guard
against
in
the
whirl
of
this
great
city
where
we
are
all
striving
to
get
ahead
is
not
to
sell
one
self
for
money
not
to
sacrifice
the
thing
worth
doing
for
mere
pecuniary
advantage
it
the
great
temptation
to
some
to
do
so
for
only
money
can
buy
fine
houses
and
carriages
and
jewels
yes
and
in
a
certain
sense
social
preferment
the
problem
is
presented
in
a
different
form
to
every
man
some
can
grow
rich
honestly
and
some
have
to
remain
poor
in
order
to
be
true
to
themselves
we
may
have
to
remain
poor
selma
mia
he
spoke
gayly
as
though
that
prospect
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
and
we
shall
be
just
as
good
as
the
people
who
own
these
houses
she
said
it
gravely
as
if
it
were
a
declaration
of
principles
and
at
the
same
moment
her
gaze
was
caught
and
disturbed
by
a
pair
of
blithe
fashionably
dressed
young
women
gliding
by
her
with
the
quiet
unconscious
grace
of
she
was
inwardly
aware
though
she
would
never
acknowledge
it
by
word
or
sign
that
such
people
troubled
her
more
even
than
taylor
had
troubled
her
they
were
different
from
her
and
they
tantalized
her
at
the
same
moment
her
husband
was
saying
in
reply
just
as
good
but
not
necessarily
any
better
no
other
things
being
equal
not
so
good
we
must
deceive
ourselves
with
that
piece
of
cant
some
of
them
are
frivolous
enough
and
dishonest
enough
heaven
knows
but
so
there
are
frivolous
and
dishonest
people
in
every
class
but
there
are
many
more
who
endeavor
to
be
good
citizens
are
good
citizens
our
best
citizens
the
possession
of
money
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
become
arbiters
of
morals
and
taste
and
to
seek
culture
under
the
best
advantages
after
all
an
accumulation
of
money
represents
brains
and
energy
in
some
one
look
at
this
swell
he
continued
indicating
an
attractive
looking
young
man
who
was
passing
his
grandfather
was
one
of
the
ablest
men
in
the
city
an
intelligent
shrewd
industrious
citizen
who
made
a
large
fortune
the
son
has
had
advantages
which
i
have
never
had
and
i
happen
to
know
that
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
a
very
able
one
if
it
came
to
comparisons
i
should
be
obliged
to
admit
that
he
a
more
ornamental
member
of
society
than
jones
brown
or
robinson
and
certainly
no
less
useful
do
i
shock
you
you
sweet
unswerving
little
democrat
of
the
democrats
it
always
pleased
selma
to
be
called
endearing
names
and
it
suited
her
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
to
be
dubbed
a
democrat
for
it
did
not
suit
her
to
be
painfully
realizing
that
she
was
unable
at
one
brilliant
swoop
to
take
her
place
as
a
leader
in
social
influence
somehow
she
had
expected
to
do
this
despite
her
first
difficulties
at
benham
for
she
had
thought
of
new
york
as
a
place
where
as
the
wife
of
littleton
the
architect
she
would
at
once
be
a
figure
of
importance
she
shook
her
head
and
said
it
hard
to
believe
that
these
people
are
really
in
earnest
that
they
are
serious
in
purpose
and
spirit
meanwhile
she
was
being
haunted
by
the
irritating
reflection
that
her
clothes
and
her
bearing
were
inferior
to
those
of
the
women
she
was
passing
secretly
she
was
making
a
resolve
to
imitate
them
though
she
believed
that
she
despised
them
she
put
her
hand
through
her
husband
arm
and
added
almost
fiercely
as
she
pressed
closer
to
him
we
need
trouble
our
heads
about
them
wilbur
we
can
get
along
without
being
rich
and
fashionable
you
and
i
in
spite
of
what
you
say
i
do
consider
this
sort
of
thing
american
get
along
darling
i
was
merely
trying
to
be
just
to
them
to
let
you
see
that
they
are
not
so
black
as
they
painted
we
will
forget
them
forever
we
have
nothing
in
common
with
them
get
along
i
feel
that
my
life
will
be
a
paradise
living
with
you
and
trying
to
make
some
impression
on
the
life
of
this
big
striving
city
but
as
to
its
not
being
american
to
live
like
these
people
well
you
know
they
are
americans
and
that
new
york
is
the
mecca
of
the
sons
of
toil
from
all
over
the
country
who
have
made
money
but
you
right
selma
those
who
go
in
for
show
and
extravagance
are
not
the
best
americans
the
americans
whom
you
and
i
believe
in
sometimes
i
get
discouraged
when
i
stop
to
think
and
now
i
shall
have
you
to
keep
me
steadfast
to
our
faith
yes
wilbur
and
how
far
from
here
are
we
to
live
oh
a
mile
or
more
on
some
side
street
where
the
land
is
cheap
and
the
rent
low
what
do
we
care
for
that
selma
mia
chapter
ii
shortly
before
selma
littleton
took
up
her
abode
in
new
york
miss
florence
or
as
she
was
familiarly
known
miss
flossy
price
was
an
inhabitant
of
a
new
jersey
city
her
father
was
a
second
cousin
of
morton
price
whose
family
at
that
time
was
socially
conspicuous
in
fashionable
new
york
society
not
aggressively
conspicuous
as
ultra
fashionable
people
are
by
dint
of
frequent
newspaper
advertisement
but
in
consequence
of
elegant
conservative
respectability
fortified
by
and
cushioned
on
a
huge
income
in
the
early
seventies
to
know
the
morton
prices
was
a
social
passport
and
by
no
means
every
one
socially
ambitious
knew
them
morton
had
been
a
peddler
his
grandfather
a
tea
merchant
his
father
a
tea
merchant
and
bank
organizer
and
he
himself
did
nothing
mercantile
but
was
a
director
in
diverse
institutions
representing
trusts
or
philantrophy
and
was
regarded
by
many
including
himself
as
the
embodiment
of
ornamental
and
admirable
citizenship
he
could
talk
by
the
hour
on
the
degeneracy
of
state
and
city
politics
and
the
evil
deeds
of
congress
and
was
generally
speaking
a
conservative
fastidious
man
who
had
a
winning
way
with
women
and
a
happy
faculty
of
looking
wise
and
saying
nothing
rash
in
the
presence
of
men
some
of
the
younger
generation
were
apt
with
the
lack
of
reverence
belonging
to
youth
to
speak
of
him
covertly
as
a
stuffed
club
but
no
echo
of
this
epithet
had
ever
reached
the
ear
of
his
cousin
david
price
in
new
jersey
for
him
as
for
most
of
the
world
within
a
radius
of
two
hundred
miles
he
was
above
criticism
and
a
monument
of
social
power
david
price
miss
flossy
father
was
the
president
of
a
small
and
unprogressive
but
eminently
solid
bank
respectable
routine
was
his
motto
and
he
lived
up
to
it
and
as
a
consequence
no
more
sound
institution
of
the
kind
existed
in
his
neighborhood
he
and
his
directors
were
slow
to
adopt
innovations
of
any
kind
they
put
stumbling
blocks
in
the
path
of
business
convenience
whenever
they
could
in
short
david
price
in
his
humble
way
was
a
righteous
narrow
retarder
of
progress
and
worshipper
of
established
local
custom
therefore
it
was
a
constant
source
of
surprise
and
worry
to
him
that
he
should
have
a
progressive
daughter
there
were
four
other
children
patterns
of
quiet
plodding
conservatism
but
such
is
the
irony
of
fate
the
youngest
prettiest
and
his
favorite
was
an
independent
opinionated
young
woman
who
seemed
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
paternal
and
maternal
advice
of
safest
new
jersey
type
in
her
father
words
she
had
no
reverence
for
any
thing
or
any
body
which
was
approximately
true
for
she
did
not
hesitate
to
speak
disrespectfully
even
of
the
head
of
the
house
in
new
york
poppa
she
said
one
day
cousin
morton
does
care
for
any
of
us
a
little
bit
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
she
added
that
he
sends
you
two
turkeys
every
thanksgiving
the
last
were
terribly
tough
sure
he
thinks
that
we
never
see
turkeys
here
in
new
jersey
and
that
he
considers
us
poor
relations
and
that
we
live
in
a
hole
if
one
of
us
should
call
on
him
i
know
it
would
distress
him
awfully
he
right
in
thinking
that
this
is
a
hole
nothing
ever
happens
here
and
when
i
marry
i
intend
to
live
in
new
york
this
was
when
she
was
seventeen
her
father
was
greatly
shocked
especially
as
he
suspected
in
his
secret
soul
that
the
tirade
was
true
in
substance
he
had
been
the
recipient
of
thanksgiving
turkeys
for
nearly
twenty
years
on
the
plea
that
they
had
been
grown
on
the
farm
in
westchester
county
and
he
had
seen
fit
to
invite
his
annually
to
dine
off
one
of
them
as
a
modest
notice
that
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
his
aristocratic
new
york
cousin
but
in
all
these
twenty
years
turkeys
had
been
the
only
medium
of
intercourse
between
them
david
price
on
the
few
occasions
when
he
had
visited
new
york
had
not
found
it
convenient
to
call
once
he
had
walked
by
on
the
other
side
of
fifth
avenue
and
looked
at
the
house
but
shyness
and
the
thought
that
he
had
no
evening
clothes
in
his
valise
had
restrained
him
from
ringing
the
doorbell
you
do
your
cousin
morton
great
injustice
great
injustice
florence
he
answered
he
never
forgets
to
send
the
turkeys
and
as
to
the
rest
of
your
speech
i
have
only
to
say
that
it
is
very
disrespectful
and
very
foolish
the
next
time
i
go
to
new
york
i
will
take
you
to
call
on
your
cousins
and
what
would
i
say
to
them
no
thank
you
poppa
the
young
woman
shook
her
head
decisively
and
then
she
added
i
not
going
to
call
on
them
until
i
fit
to
there
the
ambiguity
of
this
remark
gave
price
the
opportunity
to
say
that
in
view
of
her
immediate
shortcomings
it
was
a
wise
conclusion
but
he
knew
what
she
really
meant
and
was
distressed
his
feeling
toward
his
cousin
though
mildly
envious
did
not
extend
to
nor
had
it
served
to
undermine
his
faith
in
the
innate
dignity
and
worth
of
new
jersey
family
life
he
could
not
only
with
a
straight
face
but
with
a
kindling
eye
inveigh
against
the
perils
of
new
york
fashionable
life
and
express
gratification
that
no
son
or
daughter
of
his
had
wandered
so
far
from
the
fold
it
distressed
him
to
think
that
florence
should
be
casting
sheep
eyes
at
the
of
gotham
and
so
failing
to
appreciate
the
blessings
and
safety
of
a
quiet
american
home
miss
flossy
continued
to
entertain
and
to
express
opinions
of
her
own
and
as
a
result
became
socially
interesting
at
eighteen
by
her
beauty
her
engaging
frankness
and
lack
of
she
spread
havoc
among
the
young
men
of
her
native
city
several
of
whom
offered
her
marriage
but
marriage
was
far
from
her
thoughts
life
seemed
too
interesting
and
she
wished
to
see
the
world
she
was
erect
and
alert
looking
with
a
compact
figure
of
medium
height
large
brown
eyes
and
rich
red
hair
and
a
laughing
mouth
also
an
innocent
demeanor
which
served
to
give
her
by
moonlight
the
effect
of
an
angel
she
succeeded
in
visiting
bar
harbor
where
she
promptly
became
a
bright
particular
star
among
the
galaxy
of
young
women
who
at
that
period
were
establishing
the
reputation
of
the
summer
girl
she
continued
to
be
a
summer
girl
for
four
seasons
without
injury
to
her
own
peace
of
mind
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
summer
she
appeared
on
close
scrutiny
to
be
a
little
worn
and
her
innocent
air
seemed
a
trifle
deliberate
she
returned
to
her
home
in
new
jersey
in
not
quite
her
usual
spirits
in
fact
she
became
pensive
she
had
seen
the
world
and
lo
she
found
it
stuffed
with
sawdust
she
was
ready
to
settle
down
but
the
only
man
with
whom
she
would
have
been
willing
to
settle
had
never
asked
her
he
was
the
brother
of
one
of
the
girls
who
had
been
forbidden
by
her
mother
to
stay
out
in
canoes
with
young
men
after
nine
at
night
the
rumor
had
reached
flossy
that
this
same
mother
had
referred
to
her
in
the
fish
pond
at
rodick
as
that
dreadful
girl
it
would
have
pleased
her
after
that
to
have
wrung
an
offer
of
marriage
from
the
son
and
heir
who
knew
her
cousins
the
morton
prices
and
to
whom
she
would
have
been
willing
to
engage
herself
temporarily
at
all
events
he
was
very
devoted
they
stayed
out
in
his
canoe
until
past
midnight
he
wrote
verses
to
her
and
told
her
his
innermost
thoughts
but
he
stopped
there
he
went
away
without
committing
himself
and
she
was
left
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
it
was
bitter
not
because
she
was
in
love
with
him
for
she
was
not
in
her
heart
she
knew
he
bored
her
a
little
but
she
was
piqued
evidently
he
had
been
afraid
to
marry
that
dreadful
girl
she
was
piqued
and
she
was
sad
she
recognized
that
it
was
another
case
of
not
being
fit
when
would
she
be
fit
what
was
she
to
do
in
order
to
become
fit
fit
like
the
girl
who
was
not
allowed
to
stay
on
the
water
after
nine
she
had
ceased
to
think
of
the
young
man
but
the
image
of
his
sister
haunted
her
how
stylish
she
was
yet
how
simple
and
quiet
i
wonder
thought
flossy
to
herself
if
i
could
ever
become
like
her
the
reflection
threw
her
into
a
brown
study
in
which
she
remained
for
weeks
and
during
which
she
refused
the
hand
of
a
staid
and
respectable
townsman
who
in
her
father
words
was
ready
to
take
her
with
all
her
follies
david
price
was
disappointed
he
loved
this
independent
daughter
and
he
had
hopes
that
her
demure
and
reticent
deportment
signified
that
the
effervescence
of
youth
had
evaporated
but
it
was
only
an
effort
on
flossy
part
to
imitate
the
young
sister
at
this
juncture
and
just
when
she
was
bored
and
dispirited
by
the
process
gregory
williams
appeared
on
the
scene
flossy
met
him
at
a
dancing
party
he
had
a
very
tall
collar
a
very
friendly
confident
and
toward
her
devoted
manner
and
good
looks
it
was
whispered
among
the
girls
that
he
was
a
banker
from
new
york
he
was
obviously
not
over
thirty
which
was
young
for
a
banker
but
so
he
presently
described
himself
to
flossy
with
hints
of
impending
prosperity
he
spoke
glibly
and
picturesquely
he
had
a
convincing
eloquence
of
gesture
a
wave
of
the
hand
which
suggested
energy
and
compelled
confidence
he
had
picked
her
out
at
once
to
be
introduced
to
and
sympathy
between
them
was
speedily
established
her
wearing
as
a
girl
a
white
horse
in
the
form
of
a
pin
in
order
to
prevent
the
attention
of
the
men
to
whom
she
talked
from
wandering
delighted
him
he
said
to
himself
that
here
was
a
girl
after
his
own
heart
he
had
admired
her
looks
at
the
outset
but
he
gazed
at
her
now
more
critically
he
danced
every
dance
with
her
and
they
sat
together
at
supper
apart
from
everybody
else
flossy
resolutions
were
swept
away
that
is
she
had
become
in
an
instant
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
the
new
york
girl
she
had
yearned
to
imitate
would
not
have
made
herself
so
conspicuous
her
excuse
was
that
she
could
not
help
herself
it
was
a
case
of
genuine
violent
attraction
which
she
made
no
effort
to
straggle
against
the
attraction
was
violent
on
both
sides
gregory
williams
was
not
seeking
to
be
married
he
had
been
until
within
six
months
a
clerk
and
had
become
a
banker
on
the
strength
of
ten
thousand
dollars
bequeathed
to
him
by
a
grandmother
he
and
a
clerk
from
another
office
willett
vanhorne
had
recently
formed
a
partnership
as
williams
vanhorne
bankers
and
dealers
in
stocks
and
bonds
he
was
not
seeking
to
be
married
but
he
intended
to
be
married
some
day
and
it
was
no
part
of
his
scheme
of
life
to
deny
himself
anything
he
wished
support
a
wife
of
course
he
could
and
support
her
in
the
same
grandiose
fashion
which
he
had
adopted
for
himself
since
he
had
begun
business
on
his
own
account
he
had
chosen
as
a
philosophy
of
life
the
smart
paradox
which
he
enjoyed
uttering
that
he
spent
what
he
needed
first
and
supplied
the
means
later
and
at
the
same
time
he
let
it
be
understood
that
the
system
worked
wonderfully
he
possessed
unlimited
confidence
in
himself
and
though
he
was
dimly
aware
that
a
very
small
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
in
the
wrong
direction
would
ruin
him
financially
he
chose
to
close
his
eyes
to
the
possibilities
of
disaster
and
to
assume
a
bold
and
important
bearing
before
the
world
he
had
implicit
faith
in
his
own
special
line
of
ability
and
he
appreciated
the
worth
of
his
partner
vanhorne
he
had
joined
forces
with
vanhorne
because
he
knew
that
he
was
the
opposite
of
himself
that
he
was
a
delving
thorough
shrewd
keen
office
man
and
able
too
how
genuinely
able
williams
did
not
yet
know
he
himself
was
to
be
the
showy
partner
the
originator
of
schemes
and
procurer
of
business
the
brilliant
man
before
the
world
so
there
was
some
method
in
his
madness
and
with
it
all
went
a
cheery
incisive
humorous
point
of
view
which
was
congenial
and
diverting
to
flossy
he
went
away
but
he
came
back
once
twice
thrice
in
quick
succession
on
business
so
he
said
casually
to
and
price
but
his
language
to
their
daughter
was
a
declaration
of
personal
devotion
it
remained
for
her
to
say
whether
she
would
marry
him
or
no
of
one
thing
she
was
sure
without
need
of
reflection
that
she
loved
him
ardently
as
a
consequence
she
surrendered
at
once
though
curiously
enough
she
was
conscious
when
she
permitted
him
to
kiss
her
with
effusion
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
she
had
intended
to
marry
that
he
was
not
fit
in
her
sense
of
the
word
yet
she
was
determined
to
marry
him
and
from
the
moment
their
troth
was
plighted
she
found
herself
his
eager
and
faithful
ally
dreaming
and
scheming
on
their
joint
account
she
would
help
him
to
succeed
they
would
conquer
the
world
together
she
would
never
doubt
his
ability
to
conquer
it
and
in
time
yes
in
time
they
would
make
even
the
morton
prices
notice
them
and
so
after
some
bewildered
opposition
on
the
part
of
price
who
was
alternately
appalled
and
fascinated
by
the
magniloquent
language
of
his
they
were
married
flossy
gave
but
a
single
sign
to
her
husband
that
she
understood
him
and
recognized
what
they
really
represented
it
was
one
evening
a
few
months
after
they
had
set
up
housekeeping
while
they
were
walking
home
from
the
theatre
they
had
previously
dined
at
delmonico
and
the
cost
of
the
entertainment
including
a
bottle
of
champagne
at
dinner
their
tickets
and
a
corsage
bouquet
of
violets
for
flossy
had
been
fifteen
dollars
flossy
wore
a
resplendent
theatre
hat
and
fashionable
cape
one
of
the
several
stylish
costumes
with
which
her
husband
had
hastened
to
present
her
and
gregory
was
convoying
her
along
the
avenue
with
the
air
of
a
man
not
averse
to
have
the
world
recognize
that
they
were
a
well
set
up
and
prosperous
couple
flossy
had
put
her
arm
well
inside
his
and
was
doing
her
best
to
help
him
produce
the
effect
which
he
desired
when
she
suddenly
said
i
wonder
gregory
how
long
it
will
be
before
we
really
anybody
now
of
course
we
only
make
believe
swell
gregory
gave
an
amused
laugh
what
a
clever
little
woman
that
just
what
we
are
we
keep
it
a
secret
though
and
wo
advertise
it
to
the
world
mum
the
word
she
replied
giving
his
arm
a
squeeze
i
only
wished
you
to
know
that
i
was
not
being
fooled
that
i
understood
fate
ordained
that
the
williamses
and
the
littletons
should
take
houses
side
by
side
in
the
same
block
it
was
a
new
block
and
at
first
they
were
the
sole
occupants
williams
bought
his
house
giving
a
mortgage
back
to
the
seller
for
all
the
man
would
accept
and
obtaining
a
second
mortgage
from
a
money
lender
in
consideration
of
a
higher
rate
of
interest
for
practically
the
remaining
value
he
furnished
his
house
ornately
from
top
to
bottom
in
the
latest
fashion
incurring
bills
for
a
portion
of
the
effects
and
arranging
to
pay
on
the
instalment
plan
where
he
could
not
obtain
full
credit
his
reasoning
was
convincing
to
himself
and
did
not
alarm
flossy
who
was
glad
to
feel
that
they
were
the
owners
of
the
house
and
attractive
furniture
it
was
that
the
land
was
sure
to
improve
in
value
before
the
mortgage
became
due
and
as
for
the
carpets
and
curtains
and
other
outlays
a
few
points
in
the
stock
market
would
pay
for
them
at
any
time
wilbur
littleton
did
not
possess
the
ready
money
to
buy
consequently
he
took
a
lease
of
his
new
house
for
three
years
and
paid
promptly
for
the
furniture
he
bought
the
selection
of
which
was
gradual
gregory
williams
had
a
marvellous
way
of
entering
a
shop
and
buying
everything
which
pleased
his
eye
at
one
fell
swoop
but
wilbur
who
desired
to
accomplish
the
best
æsthetic
effects
possible
consistent
with
his
limited
means
trotted
selma
from
one
shop
to
another
before
choosing
this
process
of
selecting
slowly
the
things
with
which
they
were
to
pass
their
lives
was
a
pleasure
to
him
and
as
he
supposed
to
selma
she
did
enjoy
keenly
at
first
beholding
the
enticing
contents
of
the
various
stores
which
they
entered
in
the
process
of
procuring
carpets
and
the
other
essentials
for
it
was
a
revelation
to
her
that
such
beautiful
things
existed
and
her
inclination
was
to
purchase
the
most
showy
and
the
most
costly
articles
in
the
adornment
of
her
former
home
babcock
had
given
her
a
free
hand
that
is
his
disposition
had
been
to
buy
the
finest
things
which
the
shopkeepers
of
benham
called
to
his
attention
she
understood
now
that
his
taste
and
the
taste
of
benham
and
even
her
had
been
at
fault
but
she
found
herself
hampered
now
by
a
new
and
annoying
limitation
the
smallness
of
their
means
almost
every
thing
was
very
expensive
and
she
was
obliged
to
pass
by
the
patterns
and
materials
she
desired
to
possess
and
accept
articles
of
a
more
sober
and
less
engaging
character
many
of
these
to
be
sure
were
declared
by
wilbur
to
be
artistically
charming
and
more
suitable
than
many
which
she
preferred
but
it
would
have
suited
her
better
to
fix
on
the
rich
upholstery
and
solid
furniture
which
were
evidently
the
latest
fashion
in
household
decoration
rather
than
go
mousing
from
place
to
place
only
at
last
to
pick
up
in
the
back
corner
of
some
store
this
or
that
object
which
was
both
reasonably
pretty
and
reasonably
cheap
when
it
was
all
over
selma
was
pleased
with
the
effect
of
her
establishment
but
she
had
eaten
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
she
had
visited
the
new
york
shops
these
in
her
capacity
of
a
american
she
would
have
been
ready
to
anathematize
in
a
speech
or
in
a
newspaper
article
but
the
memory
of
them
haunted
her
imagination
and
left
her
domestic
yearnings
not
wholly
satisfied
wilbur
littleton
scheme
of
domestic
life
was
essentially
spiritual
and
in
the
development
of
it
he
felt
that
he
was
consulting
his
tastes
and
theories
no
less
than
his
own
he
knew
that
she
understood
that
he
was
ambitious
to
make
a
name
for
himself
as
an
architect
but
to
make
it
only
by
virtue
of
work
of
a
high
order
that
he
was
unwilling
to
become
a
or
to
lower
his
professional
standards
merely
to
make
temporary
progress
which
in
the
end
would
mar
a
success
worth
having
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
made
this
clear
to
her
and
that
she
sympathized
with
him
as
a
married
man
it
was
his
desire
and
intention
not
to
allow
his
interest
in
this
ambition
to
interfere
with
the
enjoyment
of
the
new
great
happiness
which
had
come
into
his
life
he
would
be
a
professional
recluse
no
longer
he
would
cast
off
his
work
when
he
left
his
office
and
devote
his
evenings
to
the
æsthetic
delights
of
selma
society
they
would
read
aloud
he
would
tell
her
his
plans
and
ask
her
advice
they
would
go
now
and
then
to
the
theatre
and
in
justice
to
her
they
would
occasionally
entertain
their
friends
and
accept
invitations
from
them
with
this
outlook
in
mind
he
had
made
such
an
outlay
as
would
render
his
home
attractive
and
cosey
simple
as
became
a
couple
just
beginning
life
yet
the
abode
of
a
gentleman
and
a
lover
of
inspiring
and
pretty
things
as
has
been
mentioned
littleton
was
a
unitarian
and
one
effect
of
his
faith
had
been
to
make
his
point
of
view
broad
and
straightforward
he
detested
hypocrisy
and
cant
subterfuge
and
he
was
content
to
let
other
people
live
according
to
their
own
lights
without
too
much
distress
on
their
account
but
he
was
too
honest
and
too
to
be
able
to
deceive
himself
as
to
his
own
motives
and
his
own
conduct
he
had
no
intention
to
be
morbid
but
he
saw
clearly
that
it
was
his
privilege
and
his
duty
to
be
true
to
both
his
loves
his
wife
and
his
profession
and
that
if
he
neglected
either
he
would
be
so
far
false
to
his
best
needs
and
aspirations
yet
he
felt
that
for
the
moment
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
err
on
the
side
of
devotion
to
his
wife
until
she
should
become
accustomed
to
her
new
surroundings
the
problem
of
the
proper
arrangement
and
subdivision
of
life
in
a
large
city
and
in
these
seething
modern
times
is
perplexing
to
all
of
us
there
are
so
many
things
we
would
like
to
do
which
we
can
not
so
many
things
which
we
do
against
our
wills
we
are
perpetually
squinting
at
happiness
but
just
as
we
get
a
delightful
vision
before
our
eyes
we
are
whisked
off
by
duty
or
ambition
or
the
force
of
social
momentum
to
try
a
different
view
consequently
our
perennial
regret
is
apt
to
be
that
we
have
seen
our
real
interests
and
our
real
friends
as
in
a
panorama
for
a
fleeting
moment
and
then
no
more
until
the
next
time
for
littleton
this
was
less
true
than
for
most
his
life
was
deep
and
stable
rather
than
to
be
sure
his
brain
experienced
now
and
then
the
dazing
effects
of
trying
to
confront
all
the
problems
of
the
universe
and
adapt
his
architectural
endeavors
to
his
interpretation
of
them
and
he
knew
well
the
bewildering
difficulties
of
the
process
of
adjusting
professional
theories
to
the
sterile
conditions
which
workaday
practice
often
presented
but
this
crowding
of
his
mental
canvas
was
all
in
the
line
of
his
life
purpose
the
days
were
too
short
and
sometimes
left
him
perplexed
and
harassed
by
their
rush
yet
he
was
still
pursuing
the
tenor
of
his
way
the
interest
of
marriage
was
not
therefore
in
his
case
a
fresh
burden
on
a
soul
already
laden
with
a
variety
of
side
pursuits
he
was
neither
socially
nor
philanthropically
active
he
was
not
a
club
man
nor
an
athletic
enthusiast
he
was
on
no
committees
he
voted
on
election
days
but
he
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
politics
for
selma
sake
all
this
must
be
changed
and
he
was
glad
to
acknowledge
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
as
well
as
to
her
to
widen
his
sympathies
as
a
first
step
in
reform
he
began
to
leave
his
office
daily
at
five
instead
of
six
and
on
saturdays
as
soon
after
two
as
possible
for
a
few
months
these
brands
of
time
snatched
from
the
furnace
of
his
professional
ardor
were
devoted
to
the
shopping
relative
to
when
that
was
over
to
walking
with
selma
sometimes
as
a
sheer
round
of
exercise
in
company
sometimes
to
visit
a
exhibition
of
pictures
or
other
attraction
of
the
hour
but
the
evening
was
for
him
the
ideal
portion
of
the
day
when
after
dinner
was
done
they
made
themselves
comfortable
in
the
new
library
their
living
room
and
it
became
his
privilege
to
read
aloud
to
her
or
to
compare
ideas
with
her
regarding
books
and
pictures
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
it
had
been
a
dream
of
littleton
that
some
day
he
would
consecutively
the
british
poets
and
as
soon
as
the
furniture
was
all
in
place
and
the
questions
of
choice
of
rugs
and
chairs
and
pictures
had
been
settled
by
purchase
he
proposed
it
as
a
definite
occupation
whenever
they
had
nothing
else
in
view
it
delighted
him
that
selma
received
this
suggestion
with
enthusiasm
accordingly
they
devoted
their
spare
evenings
to
the
undertaking
reading
aloud
in
turn
littleton
enunciation
was
clear
and
intelligent
and
as
a
happy
lover
he
was
in
a
mood
to
fit
poetic
thoughts
to
his
own
experience
and
to
utter
them
ardently
while
he
read
selma
knew
that
she
was
ever
the
heroine
of
his
imagination
which
was
agreeable
and
she
recognized
besides
that
his
performance
in
itself
was
æsthetically
attractive
yet
in
spite
of
the
personal
tribute
selma
preferred
the
evenings
when
she
herself
was
the
elocutionist
she
enjoyed
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
and
she
enjoyed
the
emotions
which
her
utterance
of
the
rhythmic
stanzas
set
coursing
through
her
brain
it
was
obvious
to
her
that
wilbur
was
captivated
by
her
reading
and
she
delighted
in
giving
herself
up
to
the
spirit
of
the
text
with
the
reservations
appropriate
to
an
enlightened
but
virtuous
soul
for
instance
in
the
case
of
shelley
she
gloried
in
his
soaring
but
did
not
let
herself
forget
that
was
not
practical
in
the
case
of
byron
though
she
yielded
her
senses
to
the
spell
of
his
passionate
imagery
she
reflected
approvingly
that
she
was
a
married
woman
but
littleton
appreciated
also
that
his
wife
should
have
the
society
of
others
beside
himself
pauline
introduced
her
promptly
to
her
own
small
but
intelligent
feminine
circle
and
pending
pauline
removal
to
a
flat
the
saturday
evening
suppers
were
maintained
at
the
old
establishment
here
selma
made
the
acquaintance
of
her
husband
and
his
sister
friends
both
men
and
women
who
dropped
in
often
after
the
play
and
without
ceremony
for
a
weekly
interchange
of
thought
and
comradeship
selma
looked
forward
to
the
first
of
these
occasions
with
an
eager
curiosity
she
expected
a
renewal
of
the
benham
institute
only
in
a
more
impressive
form
as
befitted
a
great
literary
centre
that
papers
would
be
read
original
compositions
recited
and
many
interesting
people
of
both
sexes
perform
according
to
their
specialties
she
confidently
hoped
to
have
the
opportunity
to
declaim
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
curfew
must
not
ring
or
some
other
of
her
literary
pieces
therefore
it
was
almost
a
shock
to
her
that
the
affair
was
so
informal
and
that
the
company
seemed
chiefly
occupied
in
behaving
gayly
in
making
sallies
at
each
other
expense
which
were
greeted
with
merriment
they
seemed
to
her
like
a
lot
of
children
let
loose
from
school
there
were
no
exercises
and
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
attainments
of
the
various
guests
beyond
an
occasional
word
of
introduction
by
pauline
or
wilbur
and
this
word
was
apt
to
be
of
import
selma
realized
that
among
the
fifteen
people
present
there
were
representatives
of
various
interesting
crafts
writers
artists
a
magazine
editor
two
critics
of
the
stage
a
prominent
musician
and
a
college
professor
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
her
to
act
a
part
or
to
have
their
accomplishments
in
evidence
as
she
would
have
liked
every
one
was
very
cordial
to
her
and
appeared
desirous
to
recognize
her
as
a
permanent
member
of
their
circle
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
disappointed
at
the
absence
of
ceremony
and
formal
events
there
was
no
president
or
secretary
and
presently
the
party
went
into
the
and
sat
around
a
table
at
either
end
of
which
pauline
and
wilbur
presided
over
a
blazer
interest
centred
on
the
preparation
of
a
rabbit
and
creamed
oysters
and
pleasant
badinage
flew
from
tongue
to
tongue
selma
found
herself
between
the
magazine
editor
and
a
large
powerfully
built
man
with
a
broad
rotund
strong
face
who
was
introduced
to
her
as
dr
page
and
who
was
called
george
by
every
one
else
he
had
arrived
late
just
as
they
were
going
in
to
supper
and
his
appearance
had
been
greeted
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
he
had
placed
himself
between
pauline
and
her
and
he
showed
himself
to
thinking
one
of
the
least
dignified
of
the
company
my
dear
littleton
he
said
with
a
counterfeit
of
great
gravity
you
are
now
witnessing
an
impressive
example
of
the
politeness
of
true
friendship
there
are
cynics
who
assert
that
the
american
people
are
lacking
in
courtesy
and
cast
in
our
teeth
the
superiority
of
japanese
manners
i
wish
they
were
here
there
is
not
a
single
individual
present
male
or
female
married
or
single
who
does
not
secretly
cherish
the
amiable
belief
that
he
or
she
can
cook
things
on
a
blazer
better
than
any
one
else
and
yet
we
abstain
from
criticism
we
offer
no
suggestions
we
accept
without
a
murmur
the
proportions
of
cheese
and
beer
and
butter
inflicted
upon
us
by
our
hostess
and
her
brother
and
are
silent
we
shall
even
become
complimentary
later
can
the
japanese
vie
with
this
the
contrast
between
his
eager
grave
gaze
and
the
levity
of
his
words
puzzled
selma
he
looked
interesting
but
his
speech
seemed
to
her
trivial
and
unworthy
of
the
occasion
still
she
appreciated
that
she
must
not
be
a
and
that
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
resign
herself
to
the
situation
so
she
smiled
gayly
and
said
i
am
the
only
one
then
not
suffering
from
i
never
made
a
welsh
rabbit
nor
cooked
on
a
blazer
then
in
her
desire
for
more
serious
conversation
she
added
do
you
really
think
that
we
as
a
people
are
less
polite
than
the
japanese
the
doctor
regarded
her
with
solemn
interest
for
an
instant
as
though
he
were
pondering
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
thinking
that
she
was
remarkably
pretty
then
he
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
in
a
hoarse
whisper
said
sh
be
careful
if
the
editorial
ear
should
catch
your
proposition
the
editorial
man
would
appropriate
it
there
he
added
as
her
neighbor
bent
toward
them
in
response
to
the
summons
he
has
heard
and
your
opportunity
to
sell
an
idea
to
the
magazine
is
lost
it
is
all
very
fine
for
him
to
protest
that
he
has
heard
nothing
that
is
a
trick
of
his
trade
let
us
see
now
if
he
will
agree
to
buy
if
he
refuses
it
will
be
a
clear
case
that
he
has
heard
and
purloined
it
come
dennison
here
a
chance
for
a
ten
symposium
debate
we
as
a
nation
less
polite
than
the
japanese
we
offer
it
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
cash
and
cheap
at
the
price
dennison
who
was
a
quiet
man
with
a
brown
beard
had
paused
in
his
occupation
of
buttering
hot
toast
for
the
impending
rabbit
and
was
smiling
quizzically
if
you
have
literary
secrets
to
dispose
of
littleton
let
me
warn
you
against
making
a
confidant
of
dr
page
had
you
spoken
to
me
first
there
is
no
knowing
what
i
might
have
what
did
i
tell
you
broke
in
the
doctor
a
one
hundred
and
idea
ruthlessly
appropriated
these
editors
these
editors
it
was
tantalizing
to
selma
to
be
skirting
the
edge
of
themes
she
would
have
enjoyed
to
hear
treated
seriously
she
hoped
that
dennison
would
inquire
if
she
really
wrote
and
at
least
he
would
tell
her
something
about
his
magazine
and
literary
life
in
new
york
but
he
took
up
again
his
task
of
buttering
toast
and
sought
to
interest
her
in
that
presently
she
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
remarking
that
the
editorship
of
a
magazine
must
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
all
occupations
but
he
looked
at
her
with
his
quizzical
smile
and
answered
between
you
and
me
littleton
i
will
confide
to
you
that
a
considerable
portion
of
the
time
it
is
a
confounded
bore
to
tell
the
truth
i
much
prefer
to
sit
next
to
you
and
butter
toast
this
was
depressing
and
puzzling
to
selma
but
after
the
consumption
of
the
rabbit
and
the
oysters
there
was
some
improvement
in
the
general
tone
of
the
conversation
yet
not
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
dennison
neglected
to
confide
to
her
the
secrets
of
his
prison
house
and
dr
page
ruthlessly
refused
to
discuss
medicine
philosophy
or
the
japanese
but
here
and
there
allusion
was
made
by
one
or
another
of
the
company
to
something
which
had
been
done
in
the
world
of
letters
or
art
or
music
which
possessed
merit
or
deserved
discouragement
what
was
said
was
uttered
simply
often
trenchantly
and
lightly
but
never
as
a
dogma
or
with
the
solemnity
which
earle
had
been
wont
to
impart
to
her
opinions
just
as
the
party
was
about
to
break
up
dr
page
approached
selma
and
offered
her
his
hand
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
have
met
you
he
said
looking
into
her
face
with
his
honest
eyes
a
good
wife
was
just
what
wilbur
needed
to
insure
him
happiness
and
a
fine
career
his
friends
have
great
confidence
in
his
ability
and
we
intrust
him
to
you
in
the
belief
that
the
world
will
hear
from
him
and
i
for
one
shall
be
very
grateful
to
you
he
spoke
now
with
evident
feeling
and
his
manner
suggested
the
desire
to
be
her
friend
selma
admired
his
large
physique
and
felt
the
attraction
of
his
searching
gaze
perhaps
he
did
need
a
wife
she
answered
with
an
attempt
at
the
sprightliness
which
he
had
laid
aside
i
shall
try
not
to
let
him
be
too
indifferent
to
practical
considerations
chapter
iii
who
is
dr
page
asked
selma
of
her
husband
when
they
left
the
house
one
of
our
best
friends
and
one
of
the
leading
physicians
in
the
city
the
energy
of
that
man
is
tireless
he
is
absorbed
in
his
profession
the
only
respite
he
allows
himself
are
these
saturday
evenings
and
his
devotion
to
his
little
son
who
has
hip
disease
he
told
me
that
he
had
finished
his
day
work
only
just
before
he
came
in
what
did
you
think
of
him
he
likes
to
tease
then
he
is
married
he
is
a
widower
he
seems
interested
in
you
he
was
good
enough
to
say
that
he
thought
you
needed
a
wife
then
he
must
have
admired
you
selma
poor
fellow
i
wish
he
might
have
that
happiness
himself
i
tell
you
a
secret
he
has
desired
to
marry
pauline
for
years
they
are
devoted
friends
but
until
now
that
is
all
his
wife
was
an
actress
a
handsome
creature
two
years
after
they
were
married
she
ran
away
with
another
man
and
left
him
left
him
with
one
little
boy
a
cripple
on
whom
he
lavishes
all
the
love
of
his
big
nature
how
dreadful
yes
it
is
a
sad
story
that
was
ten
years
ago
he
was
very
young
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
it
has
been
the
making
of
him
though
in
one
way
he
had
the
pride
and
confidence
of
ability
but
he
lacked
sympathy
his
experience
and
the
appealing
presence
of
his
son
have
developed
his
nature
and
given
him
tenderness
he
has
not
been
imbittered
he
has
simply
become
gentle
and
how
he
works
he
is
already
famous
in
his
profession
does
pauline
care
for
him
i
do
know
her
feelings
i
am
sure
she
is
fond
of
him
and
admires
him
i
fancy
though
that
she
hesitates
to
renounce
her
own
ambitions
as
you
are
aware
she
is
greatly
interested
in
her
classes
and
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
higher
education
of
women
george
page
knew
her
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
i
do
not
mean
that
he
paid
her
serious
attention
then
but
he
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
her
instead
of
the
other
now
when
she
has
become
absorbed
in
her
she
would
naturally
decline
to
give
it
up
unless
she
felt
sure
that
she
could
not
be
happy
without
him
i
would
not
marry
him
if
i
were
she
said
selma
he
has
given
his
best
to
the
other
woman
he
is
the
one
at
fault
not
pauline
why
should
she
sacrifice
her
own
career
in
order
to
console
him
she
might
love
him
sufficiently
to
be
willing
to
do
so
selma
love
makes
women
blind
to
faults
but
poor
george
was
scarcely
at
fault
it
was
a
misfortune
he
made
his
choice
and
was
deceived
it
would
be
weak
of
her
to
give
up
her
own
life
merely
because
he
is
lonely
we
modern
women
have
too
much
for
that
love
is
love
and
it
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
yes
love
is
love
murmured
littleton
and
i
am
happy
in
mine
that
is
because
neither
of
us
has
loved
before
you
foolish
boy
but
as
to
this
evening
it
was
at
all
what
i
expected
are
your
friends
always
like
that
littleton
laughed
did
they
seem
to
you
frivolous
and
undignified
then
almost
they
certainly
said
nothing
serious
it
is
their
holiday
their
evening
out
they
have
to
be
serious
during
the
rest
of
the
week
busy
with
problems
and
cares
for
they
are
a
set
of
hard
workers
the
stress
of
life
is
so
rigorous
and
constant
here
in
new
york
that
we
have
learned
not
to
take
our
pleasure
sadly
when
you
become
accustomed
to
their
way
you
will
realize
that
they
are
no
less
serious
at
heart
because
they
frolic
now
and
then
selma
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
that
reminds
me
have
you
found
out
about
our
neighbors
yet
he
is
a
banker
named
williams
i
believe
i
saw
his
wife
pass
the
window
this
morning
she
was
beautifully
dressed
they
must
be
rich
i
dare
say
but
they
live
in
the
same
style
of
house
as
ours
bankers
have
mysterious
ways
of
making
money
we
can
not
compete
with
those
i
suppose
not
i
was
thinking
that
she
had
the
same
manner
as
some
of
your
friends
this
evening
only
more
pronounced
she
stopped
to
speak
to
some
one
just
in
front
of
the
house
so
i
could
observe
her
i
should
think
she
was
frivolous
but
fascinating
that
must
be
the
new
york
manner
and
consequently
she
may
be
very
much
in
earnest
it
is
given
to
every
woman
to
be
attractive
all
the
time
just
because
she
looks
in
earnest
as
it
is
to
you
dearest
but
you
be
too
severe
on
the
others
on
the
contrary
i
think
i
shall
like
williams
she
may
teach
us
to
be
practical
you
know
that
is
what
your
friends
would
like
to
have
me
help
you
to
be
wilbur
then
they
did
talk
a
word
or
two
of
sense
they
said
that
do
you
think
it
is
true
that
you
are
visionary
it
is
your
duty
to
tell
me
so
selma
when
you
think
it
just
as
i
have
told
you
that
we
can
afford
to
laugh
now
and
then
come
begin
i
have
been
your
wife
long
enough
yet
i
shall
know
better
by
the
end
of
another
six
months
a
fortnight
elapsed
before
selma
made
the
acquaintance
of
gregory
williams
it
was
not
a
chance
meeting
flossy
rang
the
bell
deliberately
one
afternoon
and
was
ushered
in
thereby
bridging
over
summarily
the
yawning
chasm
which
may
continue
to
exist
for
an
indefinite
period
between
families
in
the
same
block
who
are
waiting
to
be
introduced
i
said
to
my
husband
last
night
littleton
that
it
was
ridiculous
for
us
to
be
living
side
by
side
without
knowing
one
another
and
that
i
was
going
to
call
we
moved
in
three
weeks
before
you
so
i
the
one
who
ought
to
break
the
ice
otherwise
we
might
have
stared
at
each
other
blankly
for
three
months
looked
at
each
other
sheepishly
out
of
the
corner
of
our
eyes
for
another
three
half
bowed
for
six
months
and
finally
perhaps
reached
the
stage
where
we
are
now
neighbors
should
be
neighborly
do
you
think
so
indeed
i
do
of
course
i
knew
you
by
sight
and
i
felt
i
should
like
to
make
your
acquaintance
selma
spoke
with
enthusiasm
here
was
some
one
whose
social
deftness
was
no
less
marked
than
hallett
taylor
and
to
her
mind
more
brilliant
yet
whom
she
felt
at
once
to
be
congenial
though
she
perceived
that
her
neighbor
clothes
made
her
own
apparel
seem
dull
and
was
accordingly
disposed
to
be
on
her
guard
she
realized
instinctively
that
she
was
attracted
by
the
visitor
that
is
very
nice
of
you
said
flossy
i
told
my
husband
gregory
the
other
day
that
i
was
sure
you
were
something
literary
i
mean
littleton
of
course
and
when
he
found
out
that
he
was
i
said
we
must
certainly
cultivate
you
as
an
antidote
to
the
banking
business
gregory
a
banker
it
must
be
delightful
to
plan
houses
this
room
is
so
pretty
and
tasteful
it
is
wholly
furnished
yet
we
are
buying
things
by
degrees
as
we
find
pieces
which
we
like
we
bought
all
our
things
in
two
days
at
one
fell
swoop
said
flossy
with
a
gay
laugh
gregory
gave
the
dealers
carte
blanche
that
his
way
she
added
with
a
touch
of
pride
i
dare
say
the
house
would
have
been
prettier
if
we
could
have
taken
more
time
however
it
is
all
paid
for
now
some
of
it
was
bought
on
the
instalment
plan
but
gregory
bought
or
sold
something
in
stocks
the
next
week
which
covered
the
furniture
and
paid
for
a
present
for
me
of
this
besides
she
said
indicating
her
cape
was
he
a
dear
selma
did
not
know
precisely
what
the
instalment
plan
was
but
she
understood
that
williams
had
been
distinctly
clever
in
his
estimation
she
perceived
that
williams
had
the
same
light
half
jocular
manner
displayed
by
wilbur
friends
and
that
she
spoke
with
bubbling
jaunty
assurance
which
was
suggestive
of
frivolity
still
wilbur
had
intimated
that
this
might
be
the
new
york
manner
and
clearly
her
neighbor
had
come
in
a
friendly
spirit
and
was
duly
appreciative
of
the
distinction
of
being
literary
besides
her
ready
disposition
to
talk
about
herself
and
her
affairs
seemed
to
selma
the
sign
of
a
willingness
to
be
truly
friendly
the
cape
she
wore
was
very
handsome
and
she
was
more
conspicuously
attired
from
head
to
foot
than
any
woman
with
whom
selma
had
ever
conversed
she
was
pretty
too
a
type
of
beauty
less
spiritual
than
her
own
with
piquant
eager
features
laughing
restless
gray
eyes
and
light
hair
which
escaped
from
her
coquettish
bonnet
in
airy
ringlets
if
they
had
met
three
years
earlier
selma
would
certainly
have
regarded
her
as
an
incarnation
of
volatility
and
servility
to
foreign
fashions
now
though
she
classed
her
promptly
as
a
frivolous
person
she
regarded
her
with
a
keen
curiosity
not
unmixed
with
and
the
reflection
came
to
her
that
a
little
of
the
new
york
manner
might
perhaps
be
desirable
when
in
new
york
yes
it
beautiful
she
replied
referring
to
the
cape
gregory
is
always
making
me
presents
like
that
he
gave
me
this
bracelet
yesterday
he
saw
it
in
the
and
went
in
and
bought
it
speaking
of
husbands
you
wo
mind
my
saying
that
i
think
littleton
is
very
distinguished
looking
i
often
see
him
pass
the
window
in
the
morning
of
course
think
so
said
selma
i
suppose
it
would
seem
flat
if
i
were
to
say
that
i
admired
williams
appearance
also
the
truth
is
no
harm
would
it
be
nice
if
we
should
happen
to
become
friends
we
are
the
pioneers
in
this
block
but
i
hear
three
other
houses
have
been
sold
i
suppose
you
own
your
house
i
believe
not
we
have
a
lease
of
it
that
a
pity
because
gregory
bought
ours
on
a
mortgage
thinking
the
land
is
sure
to
become
more
valuable
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
sell
some
day
for
a
great
deal
more
than
he
paid
for
it
may
i
ask
where
you
lived
before
you
were
married
selma
told
her
briefly
then
you
are
almost
western
i
felt
sure
you
were
a
new
yorker
and
i
did
think
you
were
from
boston
you
have
the
boston
earnest
expression
but
somehow
you
different
you
do
mind
my
analyzing
you
do
you
that
a
boston
habit
by
the
way
but
i
not
from
boston
i
lived
all
my
life
in
new
jersey
so
we
are
both
strangers
in
new
york
that
is
i
the
same
as
a
stranger
though
my
father
is
a
cousin
of
the
morton
prices
we
sent
them
wedding
cards
and
they
called
one
day
when
i
was
out
i
shall
return
the
call
and
find
them
out
and
that
will
be
the
last
move
on
either
side
until
gregory
does
something
remarkable
i
rather
glad
i
was
at
home
because
it
would
have
been
awkward
they
would
have
known
what
to
say
to
me
and
they
might
have
felt
that
they
ought
to
ask
me
to
dinner
and
i
do
care
to
have
them
ask
me
until
they
obliged
to
do
i
shock
you
running
on
so
about
my
own
affairs
flossy
asked
noticing
selma
draw
herself
up
sternly
oh
no
i
like
that
i
was
only
thinking
that
it
was
very
strange
of
your
cousins
you
are
as
good
as
they
are
you
mercy
no
we
both
know
it
and
that
what
makes
the
situation
so
awkward
as
christians
they
had
to
call
on
me
but
i
really
think
they
are
justified
in
stopping
there
socially
i
nobody
in
this
country
we
are
all
free
and
equal
you
a
dear
a
delicious
dear
retorted
flossy
with
a
caressing
laugh
there
something
of
the
sort
in
the
declaration
of
independence
but
as
gregory
says
that
was
put
in
as
a
bluff
to
console
salesladies
was
everybody
equal
in
benham
mrs
littleton
practically
so
said
selma
with
an
air
of
haughtiness
which
was
evoked
by
her
recollection
of
the
group
of
houses
on
benham
river
drive
into
which
she
had
never
been
invited
there
were
some
people
who
were
richer
than
others
but
that
did
make
them
better
than
any
one
else
well
in
new
york
it
different
of
course
every
body
has
the
same
right
to
vote
or
to
be
elected
president
of
the
united
states
but
equality
ends
there
people
here
are
either
in
society
or
out
of
it
and
society
itself
is
divided
into
sets
there
the
conservative
aristocratic
set
the
smart
rapid
set
the
set
which
has
much
money
but
has
knickerbocker
or
other
highly
respectable
ancestors
the
new
millionaire
set
the
literary
set
the
intellectual
philanthropic
set
and
so
on
according
to
one
means
or
tastes
each
has
its
little
circle
which
shades
away
into
the
others
and
every
now
and
then
there
is
a
big
entertainment
to
which
they
all
go
i
see
said
selma
coldly
now
to
make
it
plain
i
will
confide
to
you
in
strictest
confidence
that
gregory
and
i
are
yet
really
in
any
set
we
are
trying
to
get
a
footing
and
are
holding
on
by
our
teeth
to
the
fringe
of
the
social
i
would
admit
it
to
any
one
but
you
but
as
you
are
a
stranger
like
myself
and
in
the
same
block
i
am
glad
to
initiate
you
into
the
customs
of
this
part
of
the
country
flossy
gave
a
merry
toss
to
her
head
which
set
her
ringlets
bobbing
and
rose
to
go
and
in
what
set
are
your
cousins
asked
selma
if
you
wish
to
hear
about
them
i
shall
have
to
sit
down
again
the
belong
to
the
solid
stupid
aristocratic
set
the
most
dignified
and
august
of
all
they
are
almost
as
sacred
as
hindoo
gods
and
some
people
would
walk
over
coals
to
gain
admission
to
their
house
and
really
it
quite
just
in
one
way
that
incense
should
be
burnt
before
them
you
must
look
so
disgusted
because
there
some
sense
in
it
all
as
gregory
says
it
best
to
look
things
squarely
in
the
face
most
of
the
people
in
these
different
sets
are
somebodies
because
either
their
grandfathers
or
they
have
done
something
well
better
than
other
people
and
made
money
as
a
consequence
and
when
a
family
has
made
money
or
won
distinction
by
its
brains
and
then
has
brushed
its
teeth
twice
a
day
religiously
for
two
generations
the
members
of
it
even
though
dull
are
entitled
to
respect
do
you
think
so
selma
who
brushed
her
teeth
but
once
a
day
looked
a
little
sharp
at
flossy
it
makes
money
of
too
much
importance
and
it
establishes
class
distinctions
i
do
approve
of
such
a
condition
of
affairs
at
all
flossy
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
have
never
thought
whether
i
approve
of
it
or
not
i
am
only
telling
you
what
exists
i
do
deny
that
money
counts
for
a
great
deal
for
as
gregory
says
money
is
the
measure
of
success
but
money
is
everything
brains
count
and
refinement
and
nice
honorable
ways
of
looking
at
things
of
course
i
only
telling
you
what
my
ambition
is
people
have
different
kinds
of
bees
in
their
bonnets
some
men
have
the
presidential
bee
i
have
the
social
bee
i
should
like
to
be
recognized
as
a
prominent
member
of
the
charmed
circle
on
my
own
merits
and
show
my
cousins
that
i
am
really
worthy
of
their
attention
there
are
a
few
who
are
able
to
be
superior
to
that
sort
of
thing
who
go
on
living
their
own
lives
attractively
and
finely
without
thinking
of
society
and
who
suddenly
wake
up
some
day
to
find
themselves
socially
famous
to
find
that
they
have
been
taken
up
the
best
way
but
one
requires
to
be
the
right
sort
of
person
and
to
have
a
lot
of
moral
courage
i
can
imagine
it
happening
to
you
and
your
husband
but
it
would
never
happen
to
gregory
and
me
we
shall
have
to
make
money
and
cut
a
dash
in
order
to
attract
attention
and
if
we
are
persistent
and
clever
enough
we
may
be
recognized
as
somebodies
provided
there
is
something
original
or
interesting
about
us
there
i
have
told
you
my
secret
and
shocked
you
into
the
bargain
i
really
must
be
going
but
i
tell
you
another
secret
first
it
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
if
i
may
because
you
look
at
things
differently
and
have
a
social
bee
i
wish
i
were
like
that
really
like
it
but
then
as
gregory
would
say
i
should
be
myself
and
not
to
be
one
self
is
worse
than
anything
else
after
all
is
it
you
and
your
husband
must
come
and
dine
with
us
soon
after
williams
had
gone
selma
fell
into
a
brown
study
she
had
listened
to
sentiments
of
which
she
thoroughly
disapproved
and
which
were
at
variance
with
all
her
theories
and
conceptions
what
her
friendly
frivolous
visitor
had
told
her
with
engaging
frankness
offended
her
conscience
and
patriotism
she
did
not
choose
to
admit
the
existence
of
these
and
she
knew
that
even
if
they
did
exist
they
could
not
possibly
concern
wilbur
and
herself
even
williams
had
appreciated
that
wilbur
and
her
literary
superiority
put
them
above
and
beyond
the
application
of
any
snobbish
artificial
social
and
yet
selma
brow
was
clouded
her
thought
reverted
to
the
row
of
stately
houses
on
either
side
of
fifth
avenue
into
none
of
which
she
had
the
right
of
free
access
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
leading
her
life
attractively
and
finely
without
regard
to
society
she
thought
instinctively
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
she
saw
righteously
with
her
mind
eye
for
a
moment
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
consigning
to
destruction
these
offending
mansions
and
their
owners
as
symbols
of
mammon
and
contraband
to
god
that
evening
she
told
wilbur
of
williams
visit
she
a
bright
amusing
person
and
quite
pretty
we
took
a
fancy
to
each
other
but
what
do
you
suppose
she
said
she
intimated
that
we
have
any
social
position
very
kind
of
her
i
sure
she
must
be
a
woman
of
discrimination
likewise
something
of
a
character
she
smart
so
you
think
it
true
what
about
our
social
position
ours
is
as
good
as
theirs
i
fancy
oh
yes
wilbur
she
acknowledges
that
herself
she
admires
us
both
and
she
thinks
it
fine
that
we
do
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
what
she
said
was
chiefly
in
connection
with
herself
but
she
intimated
that
neither
they
nor
we
are
the
er
equals
of
the
people
who
live
on
fifth
avenue
and
thereabouts
she
a
cousin
of
the
morton
prices
whoever
they
may
be
and
she
declared
perfectly
frankly
that
they
were
better
than
she
was
it
funny
you
seem
to
have
made
considerable
progress
for
one
visit
i
like
that
you
know
wilbur
i
prefer
people
who
are
willing
to
tell
me
their
real
feelings
at
once
morton
price
is
one
of
the
big
bugs
his
great
grandfather
was
among
the
wise
shrewd
pioneers
in
the
commercial
progress
of
the
city
the
present
generation
are
eminently
respectable
very
dignified
mildly
philanthropic
somewhat
reasonably
harmless
decidedly
ornamental
and
rather
dull
but
williams
says
that
she
will
never
be
happy
until
her
relations
and
the
people
of
that
set
are
obliged
to
take
notice
of
her
and
that
she
and
her
husband
are
going
to
cut
a
dash
to
attract
attention
her
secret
the
cat
which
she
let
out
of
the
bag
is
a
familiar
one
she
must
be
amusing
provided
she
is
not
vulgar
i
do
think
she
vulgar
wilbur
she
wears
gorgeous
clothes
but
they
extremely
pretty
she
said
that
she
called
on
me
because
she
thought
that
we
were
literary
and
that
she
desired
an
antidote
to
the
banker
business
which
shows
she
is
altogether
worldly
she
wishes
us
to
dine
with
them
soon
that
neighborly
why
was
it
wilbur
that
you
did
buy
our
house
instead
of
hiring
it
because
i
had
money
enough
to
pay
for
it
the
williamses
bought
theirs
but
i
do
believe
they
paid
for
it
altogether
she
says
her
husband
thinks
the
land
will
increase
in
value
and
they
hope
some
day
to
make
money
by
the
rise
i
imagine
williams
must
be
shrewd
he
a
business
man
probably
he
bought
and
gave
a
mortgage
back
i
might
have
done
that
but
we
were
sure
we
should
like
the
location
and
it
is
certain
yet
that
fashion
will
move
in
just
this
direction
i
have
very
little
and
i
preferred
not
to
tie
up
everything
in
a
house
we
might
not
wish
to
keep
i
see
she
appreciates
that
people
may
take
us
up
any
time
she
thinks
you
are
distinguished
looking
if
she
is
careful
i
shall
make
you
jealous
selma
was
there
anything
you
did
discuss
i
regard
you
as
the
peer
of
any
morton
price
alive
why
are
you
far
be
it
from
me
to
discourage
such
a
wifely
conclusion
provided
you
think
so
i
do
care
for
any
one
else
opinion
but
you
agree
with
her
that
is
you
consider
because
people
of
that
sort
do
invite
us
to
their
houses
they
are
better
than
we
nothing
of
the
kind
but
there
no
use
denying
the
existence
of
social
classes
in
this
city
and
that
though
i
flatter
myself
you
and
i
are
trying
to
make
the
most
of
our
lives
in
accordance
with
the
talents
and
means
at
our
disposal
we
are
not
and
are
not
likely
to
become
for
the
present
at
any
rate
socially
prominent
that
what
you
have
in
mind
i
think
i
do
know
those
people
they
do
know
me
consequently
they
do
not
ask
me
to
their
beautiful
and
costly
entertainments
some
day
perhaps
if
i
am
very
successful
as
an
architect
we
may
come
more
in
contact
with
them
and
they
will
have
a
chance
to
discover
what
a
charming
wife
i
have
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
your
neighbor
williams
is
right
she
evidently
has
a
clear
head
on
her
shoulders
and
knows
what
she
desires
you
and
i
believe
that
we
can
get
more
happiness
out
of
life
by
pursuing
the
even
tenor
of
our
way
in
the
position
in
which
we
happen
to
find
ourselves
i
do
understand
it
said
selma
shaking
her
head
and
looking
into
space
with
her
spiritual
expression
it
troubles
me
it
is
american
i
did
think
such
distinctions
existed
in
this
country
is
it
all
a
question
of
money
then
do
intelligence
and
er
purpose
count
for
nothing
my
dear
girl
it
simply
means
that
the
people
who
are
on
top
the
people
who
by
force
of
success
or
ability
or
money
are
most
prominent
in
the
community
associate
together
and
the
world
gives
a
certain
prominence
to
their
doings
here
where
fortunes
have
been
made
so
rapidly
and
we
have
no
formal
aristocracy
money
undoubtedly
plays
a
conspicuous
part
in
giving
access
to
what
is
known
as
society
but
it
is
only
an
entering
wedge
money
supplies
the
means
to
cultivate
manners
and
the
right
way
of
looking
at
things
and
good
society
represents
the
best
manners
and
on
the
whole
the
best
way
of
looking
at
things
yes
but
you
say
that
we
do
belong
to
it
we
do
in
the
broad
but
not
in
the
narrow
sense
we
have
neither
the
means
nor
the
time
to
take
part
in
fashionable
society
surely
selma
you
have
no
such
ambition
i
you
know
i
disapprove
of
everything
of
the
sort
it
is
like
europe
there
nothing
american
in
it
i
do
know
about
that
the
people
concerned
in
it
are
americans
if
a
man
has
made
money
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
build
a
handsome
house
maintain
a
fine
establishment
give
his
children
the
best
educational
advantages
and
choose
his
own
friends
so
the
next
generation
becomes
more
civilized
it
is
the
best
americanism
to
waste
one
time
in
pursuing
frivolities
and
excessive
luxury
as
some
of
these
people
do
but
there
nothing
in
making
the
most
of
one
opportunities
as
i
said
to
you
before
selma
it
the
way
in
which
one
rises
that
the
important
thing
in
the
individual
equation
and
every
man
must
choose
for
himself
what
that
shall
be
my
ambition
is
to
excel
in
my
profession
and
to
mould
my
life
to
that
end
without
neglecting
my
duties
as
a
citizen
or
a
husband
if
in
the
end
i
win
fame
and
fortune
so
much
the
better
but
there
no
use
in
worrying
because
other
people
are
more
fashionable
than
we
of
course
you
speak
as
if
you
thought
i
was
envious
of
them
wilbur
what
i
do
understand
is
why
such
people
should
be
allowed
to
exist
in
this
country
we
a
free
people
selma
i
a
good
democrat
but
you
must
agree
that
the
in
his
muddy
garb
would
not
find
himself
at
ease
in
a
fifth
avenue
on
that
account
shall
we
abolish
the
we
are
not
not
precisely
but
we
have
our
spurs
to
win
and
unlike
some
people
in
our
respectable
but
humble
station
we
have
each
other
love
to
give
us
courage
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
bravely
i
had
a
fresh
order
and
i
have
bought
tickets
for
at
the
theatre
chapter
iv
almost
the
first
persons
at
the
theatre
on
whom
selma
eyes
rested
were
the
gregory
williamses
they
were
in
a
box
with
two
other
people
and
both
flossy
and
her
husband
were
talking
with
the
festive
air
peculiar
to
those
who
are
willing
to
be
noticed
and
conscious
that
their
wish
is
being
gratified
flossy
wore
a
gay
bonnet
and
a
stylish
frock
supplemented
by
a
huge
bunch
of
violets
and
her
husband
evening
dress
betrayed
a
slight
exaggeration
of
the
prevailing
fashion
in
respect
to
his
standing
collar
and
necktie
selma
had
never
had
a
thorough
look
at
him
before
and
she
reflected
that
he
was
decidedly
impressive
and
handsome
his
face
was
full
and
pleasant
his
mustache
large
and
gracefully
curved
and
his
figure
manly
his
most
distinguishing
characteristic
was
a
dignity
of
bearing
uncommon
in
so
young
a
man
suggesting
that
he
carried
if
not
the
destiny
of
republics
on
his
shoulders
at
least
important
financial
secrets
in
his
brain
the
man
and
woman
with
them
were
almost
elderly
and
gave
the
effect
of
being
strangers
to
the
city
they
were
and
silas
parsons
parsons
was
a
prosperous
western
business
man
who
now
and
then
visited
new
york
and
who
had
recently
become
a
customer
of
williams
he
had
dealt
in
the
office
where
williams
was
a
clerk
and
having
taken
a
fancy
to
him
was
disposed
to
help
the
new
firm
gregory
had
invited
them
to
dinner
and
to
the
theatre
by
way
of
being
attentive
and
had
taken
a
box
instead
of
stalls
in
order
to
make
his
civility
as
magnificent
as
the
occasion
would
permit
a
box
besides
being
a
delicate
testimonial
to
his
guest
would
cause
the
audience
to
notice
him
and
his
wife
and
to
ask
who
they
were
in
the
gradual
development
of
the
social
appetite
in
this
country
a
certain
class
has
been
evolved
whose
is
the
floor
of
the
leading
theatres
society
consists
for
them
chiefly
in
being
present
often
at
theatrical
performances
in
sumptuous
dress
not
merely
to
witness
the
play
but
to
be
participants
in
a
social
function
which
enhances
their
to
be
looked
at
and
to
look
on
these
occasions
takes
the
place
with
them
of
balls
and
dinner
parties
they
are
not
theatregoers
in
the
proper
sense
but
social
aspirants
and
the
boxes
and
stalls
are
for
them
an
arena
in
which
for
a
price
they
can
show
themselves
in
their
finery
and
attractions
for
lack
of
other
opportunities
our
theatres
are
now
in
the
full
blaze
of
this
harmless
appropriation
for
uses
at
the
time
when
selma
was
a
new
york
bride
the
movement
was
in
its
infancy
the
people
who
went
to
the
theatre
for
spectacular
purposes
no
less
than
to
see
the
actors
on
the
stage
were
comparatively
few
in
number
still
the
device
was
practised
and
from
the
very
fact
that
it
was
not
freely
employed
was
apt
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
public
more
unreservedly
than
the
sight
of
williams
in
a
box
in
the
glory
of
her
becoming
frock
and
her
violets
caused
even
so
stern
a
patriot
and
admirer
of
simplicity
as
selma
to
seize
her
husband
arm
and
whisper
look
what
is
more
she
caught
herself
a
moment
later
blushing
with
satisfaction
on
account
of
the
friendly
bow
which
was
bestowed
on
her
wilbur
littleton
ambitions
were
so
definite
and
congenial
that
the
sight
of
his
neighbors
splendor
neither
offended
nor
irritated
him
he
did
not
feel
obliged
to
pass
judgment
on
them
while
deriving
amusement
from
their
display
nor
did
he
experience
any
qualms
of
regret
that
he
was
not
able
to
imitate
them
he
regarded
flossy
and
her
husband
with
the
tolerant
gaze
of
one
content
to
allow
other
people
to
work
out
their
salvation
without
officious
criticism
provided
he
were
allowed
the
same
privilege
and
ready
to
enjoy
any
features
of
the
situation
which
appealed
to
his
sense
of
humor
or
to
his
human
sympathy
flossy
frank
open
nod
and
ingenuous
face
won
his
favor
at
once
especially
as
he
appreciated
that
she
and
selma
had
found
each
other
attractive
and
though
he
tabooed
luxury
and
fashionable
paraphernalia
where
he
was
immediately
concerned
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
evidently
couple
might
as
friends
introduce
just
the
right
element
of
variety
into
their
lives
he
had
no
wish
to
be
a
banker
himself
nor
to
hire
boxes
at
the
theatre
but
he
was
disposed
to
meet
these
entertaining
and
gorgeous
neighbors
selma
in
spite
of
her
wish
to
watch
the
play
found
her
glance
returning
again
and
again
to
the
occupants
of
the
box
though
she
endeavored
to
dispose
of
the
matter
by
remarking
presently
that
she
could
not
understand
why
people
should
care
to
make
themselves
so
conspicuous
particularly
as
the
seats
in
the
boxes
were
less
desirable
for
seeing
the
stage
than
their
own
we
would
care
for
it
but
probably
it
just
what
they
like
said
wilbur
some
society
reporter
may
notice
them
in
which
case
we
shall
see
in
the
sunday
newspaper
that
gregory
williams
and
party
occupied
a
private
box
at
the
empire
theatre
last
tuesday
evening
which
will
be
another
straw
toward
helping
them
to
carry
out
their
project
of
attracting
attention
i
like
the
face
of
your
new
friend
my
dear
i
mean
to
say
that
she
looks
unaffected
and
honest
and
as
if
she
had
a
sense
of
humor
with
those
three
virtues
a
woman
can
afford
to
have
some
faults
i
suppose
she
has
hers
littleton
felt
that
selma
was
disposed
to
fancy
her
neighbor
but
was
restrained
by
conscientious
scruples
due
to
her
dislike
for
society
concerns
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
and
married
his
wife
because
he
believed
her
to
be
free
from
and
superior
to
the
petty
weaknesses
of
the
feminine
social
creed
but
though
extremely
proud
of
her
uncompromising
standards
he
had
begun
to
fear
lest
she
might
indulge
her
point
of
view
so
far
as
to
be
unjust
her
scornful
references
from
time
to
time
to
those
who
had
made
money
and
occupied
fine
houses
had
wounded
his
own
sense
of
justice
he
had
endeavored
to
explain
that
virtue
was
not
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
poor
and
now
he
welcomed
an
opportunity
of
letting
her
realize
from
personal
experience
that
society
was
not
so
bad
as
it
was
painted
selma
returned
williams
call
during
the
week
but
did
not
find
her
at
home
a
few
days
later
arrived
a
note
stamped
with
a
purple
and
gold
monogram
inviting
them
to
dinner
when
the
evening
arrived
they
found
only
a
party
of
four
a
third
couple
had
given
out
at
the
last
minute
so
they
were
alone
with
their
hosts
the
williams
house
in
its
decoration
and
upholstery
was
very
different
from
their
own
the
was
bright
with
color
the
furniture
was
covered
with
light
blue
plush
there
were
blue
and
yellow
curtains
gay
cushions
and
a
profusion
of
gilt
ornamentation
a
a
show
picture
on
an
easel
and
a
variety
of
florid
completed
the
brilliant
aspect
of
the
apartment
selma
reflected
at
once
that
that
this
was
the
sort
of
which
would
have
pleased
her
had
she
been
given
her
head
and
a
full
purse
it
suggested
her
home
at
benham
refurnished
by
the
light
of
her
later
experience
undimmed
by
the
shadow
of
economy
on
the
way
down
to
dinner
she
noticed
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
a
suit
of
old
armor
and
she
was
able
to
perceive
that
the
little
room
on
one
side
of
the
front
door
which
they
learned
subsequently
was
den
contained
japanese
curiosities
the
shone
with
glass
and
silver
ware
and
was
lighted
by
four
candles
screened
by
small
pink
shades
by
the
side
of
flossy
plate
and
her
own
was
a
small
bunch
of
violets
and
there
was
a
rosebud
for
each
of
the
men
the
dinner
which
was
elaborate
was
served
by
two
trig
maids
there
were
champagne
and
frozen
pudding
selma
felt
almost
as
if
she
were
in
she
had
never
experienced
anything
just
like
this
before
but
her
exacting
conscience
was
kept
at
bay
by
the
reflection
that
this
must
be
a
further
manifestation
of
the
new
york
manner
and
her
was
propitiated
by
the
cordiality
of
her
entertainers
the
conversation
was
bubbling
and
on
the
part
of
both
and
williams
they
kept
up
a
running
prattle
on
the
current
fads
of
the
day
the
theatre
the
doings
of
social
personages
and
their
own
household
possessions
which
they
naïvely
called
to
the
attention
of
their
guests
that
they
might
be
admired
but
selma
enjoyed
more
than
the
general
conversation
her
talk
with
the
master
of
the
house
who
possessed
all
the
friendly
suavity
of
his
wife
and
also
the
valuable
masculine
trait
of
seeming
to
be
utterly
absorbed
in
any
woman
to
whom
he
was
talking
gregory
had
a
great
deal
of
manner
and
a
confidential
fluency
of
style
which
gave
distinction
even
to
commonplace
remarks
his
method
did
not
condescend
to
nudging
when
he
wished
to
note
a
point
but
it
fell
only
so
far
short
of
it
as
he
thought
social
elegance
required
his
conversation
presently
drifted
or
more
properly
speaking
flowed
into
a
graphic
and
frank
account
of
his
own
progress
as
a
banker
he
referred
to
past
successful
undertakings
descanted
on
his
present
roseate
responsibilities
and
hinted
sagely
at
impending
operations
which
would
eclipse
in
importance
any
in
which
he
had
hitherto
been
engaged
in
answer
to
selma
questions
he
discoursed
alluringly
concerning
the
methods
of
the
stock
exchange
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
for
an
intelligent
and
enterprising
man
speculation
was
the
high
road
to
fortune
no
doubt
for
fools
and
for
people
of
mediocre
or
torpid
abilities
it
was
a
dangerous
trade
but
for
keen
and
bold
intellects
what
pursuit
offered
such
dazzling
opportunities
selma
listened
abhorrent
yet
fascinated
it
worried
her
to
be
told
that
what
she
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
as
gambling
should
be
so
quickly
and
richly
rewarded
yet
the
fairy
scene
around
her
manifestly
confirmed
the
prosperous
language
of
her
host
and
left
no
room
for
doubt
that
her
neighbors
were
making
brilliant
progress
apparently
too
this
business
of
speculation
and
of
vast
combinations
of
railroad
and
other
capital
the
details
of
which
were
very
vague
to
her
was
in
his
opinion
the
most
desirable
and
profitable
of
callings
do
you
know
she
said
that
i
have
been
taught
to
believe
that
to
speculate
in
stocks
is
rather
dreadful
and
that
the
people
of
the
country
do
approve
of
it
she
spoke
smilingly
for
the
leaven
of
the
new
york
manner
was
working
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
testifying
on
behalf
of
righteousness
the
people
of
the
country
exclaimed
gregory
with
a
smile
of
complacent
amusement
my
dear
littleton
you
must
not
let
yourself
be
deceived
by
the
sunday
school
fourth
of
july
legislative
or
other
public
utterances
of
the
american
people
it
is
necessary
to
shout
it
on
the
but
i
will
confide
to
you
that
whatever
they
may
declaim
or
publish
to
the
contrary
the
american
people
are
at
heart
a
nation
of
gamblers
they
do
play
little
horses
and
other
games
in
public
for
francs
like
the
french
for
the
law
forbids
it
but
i
believe
that
any
one
except
we
bankers
and
brokers
realizes
how
widely
exists
the
habit
of
playing
the
thousands
of
people
big
and
little
sanctimonious
and
highly
respectable
put
up
their
margins
and
reap
their
profits
or
their
losses
oh
no
the
country
approve
of
it
especially
those
who
lose
i
assure
you
that
the
letters
which
pass
through
the
from
the
godly
freeborn
voters
in
the
rural
districts
would
tell
an
eloquent
story
concerning
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
the
country
in
regard
to
speculation
flossy
was
rising
from
table
as
he
finished
so
he
accompanied
the
close
of
his
statement
with
a
sweeping
bow
which
comported
with
his
jaunty
dignity
i
am
afraid
you
are
a
wicked
man
you
ought
not
to
slander
the
american
people
like
that
selma
answered
pleased
as
she
spoke
at
the
light
touch
which
she
was
able
to
impart
to
her
speech
it
true
every
word
of
it
is
true
he
said
as
she
passed
him
he
added
in
a
low
tone
i
would
almost
even
venture
to
wager
a
pair
of
gloves
that
at
some
time
or
other
your
husband
has
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
never
retorted
selma
what
is
that
gregory
is
saying
interrupted
flossy
putting
her
arm
inside
selma
i
can
see
by
his
look
that
he
has
been
plaguing
you
yes
he
has
been
trying
to
shatter
my
ideals
and
now
he
is
trying
to
induce
me
to
make
an
odious
bet
with
him
do
for
you
would
be
certain
to
lose
gregory
is
in
great
luck
nowadays
that
is
evident
for
he
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
littleton
said
williams
gallantly
the
two
men
were
left
alone
with
their
cigars
after
these
were
lighted
as
if
he
were
carrying
out
his
previous
train
of
thought
gregory
remarked
oracularly
at
the
end
of
a
puff
louisville
and
nashville
is
certain
to
sell
higher
littleton
looked
blank
for
a
moment
he
knew
so
little
of
stocks
that
at
first
he
did
not
understand
what
was
meant
then
he
said
politely
indeed
it
is
good
for
a
rise
in
my
opinion
williams
continued
after
another
puff
he
was
of
a
liberal
nature
and
was
making
a
present
of
this
tip
to
his
guest
in
the
same
spirit
of
hospitality
as
he
had
proffered
the
dinner
and
the
champagne
he
was
willing
to
take
for
granted
that
littleton
as
a
gentleman
would
give
him
the
order
in
case
he
decided
to
buy
which
would
add
another
customer
to
his
list
but
his
suggestion
was
chiefly
disinterested
i
afraid
i
know
very
little
about
such
matters
littleton
responded
with
a
smile
i
never
owned
but
ten
shares
of
stock
in
my
life
then
by
way
perhaps
of
showing
that
he
was
not
indifferent
to
all
the
good
things
which
the
occasion
afforded
he
said
indicating
a
picture
on
the
opposite
wall
that
is
a
fine
piece
of
color
williams
having
discharged
his
obligations
as
a
host
was
willing
to
exchange
the
as
a
topic
for
his
own
capacity
as
a
lightning
appreciator
and
purchaser
of
objects
of
art
yes
he
said
urbanely
that
is
a
good
thing
i
saw
it
in
the
asked
the
price
and
bought
it
i
bought
two
other
pictures
at
the
same
time
take
that
and
that
and
that
i
said
pointing
with
my
cane
the
dealer
looked
astonished
he
was
used
i
suppose
to
having
people
come
in
and
look
at
a
picture
every
day
for
a
fortnight
before
deciding
when
i
like
a
thing
i
know
it
the
three
cost
me
eighteen
hundred
dollars
and
i
paid
for
them
within
a
week
by
a
turn
in
the
market
you
were
very
fortunate
said
littleton
who
wished
to
seem
sympathetic
meanwhile
the
two
wives
had
returned
to
the
arm
in
arm
and
established
themselves
on
one
of
those
small
sofas
for
two
constructed
so
that
the
sitters
are
face
to
face
they
had
taken
a
strong
fancy
to
each
other
especially
flossy
to
selma
and
in
the
half
hour
which
followed
they
made
rapid
progress
toward
intimacy
before
they
parted
each
had
agreed
to
call
the
other
by
her
christian
name
and
selma
had
confided
the
story
of
her
divorce
flossy
listened
with
absorbed
interest
and
murmured
at
the
close
who
would
have
thought
it
you
look
so
pure
and
gentle
and
refined
that
a
man
must
have
been
a
brute
to
treat
you
like
that
but
you
are
happy
now
thank
goodness
you
have
a
husband
worthy
of
you
each
had
a
host
of
things
still
unsaid
when
littleton
and
williams
joined
them
well
my
dear
said
wilbur
as
they
left
the
house
that
was
a
sort
of
arabian
nights
entertainment
for
us
was
it
a
little
barbaric
but
handsome
and
well
intentioned
i
hope
it
did
shock
you
too
much
it
struck
me
as
very
pleasant
wilbur
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
understand
new
york
a
little
better
every
thing
costs
so
much
here
that
it
seems
necessary
to
make
money
does
it
i
do
see
exactly
how
poor
people
get
along
do
you
know
williams
wished
to
bet
me
a
pair
of
gloves
that
you
buy
stocks
sometimes
he
would
have
lost
his
bet
so
i
told
him
at
once
but
he
did
seem
to
believe
me
i
was
sure
you
never
did
he
appears
to
be
very
successful
but
i
let
him
see
that
i
knew
it
was
gambling
you
consider
it
gambling
do
you
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
some
are
gamblers
but
the
occupation
of
buying
and
selling
stocks
for
a
commission
is
a
well
recognized
and
fashionable
business
williams
thinks
that
a
great
many
americans
make
money
in
stocks
that
we
are
gamblers
as
a
nation
i
am
in
my
heart
of
the
same
opinion
oh
wilbur
i
find
you
are
not
so
good
a
patriot
as
i
supposed
i
hate
bunkum
what
is
that
saying
things
for
effect
and
professing
virtue
which
we
do
not
possess
selma
was
silent
a
moment
what
does
champagne
cost
a
bottle
about
three
dollars
and
a
half
do
you
really
think
their
house
barbaric
it
certainly
suggests
to
me
heterogeneous
barbaric
splendor
they
bought
their
upholstery
as
they
did
their
pictures
with
occasionally
they
made
a
brilliant
shot
but
oftener
they
never
hit
the
target
at
all
i
think
i
like
brighter
colors
than
you
do
wilbur
mused
selma
i
used
to
consider
things
like
that
as
wrong
but
i
suppose
that
was
because
our
fathers
wished
europe
to
understand
that
we
disapproved
of
the
luxury
of
courts
and
the
empty
lives
of
the
nobility
but
if
people
here
with
purpose
have
money
it
would
seem
sensible
to
furnish
their
houses
prettily
subject
always
to
the
crucifying
canons
of
art
laughed
littleton
i
glad
you
coming
round
to
my
view
selma
only
i
deny
the
ability
of
the
american
with
the
overflowing
purse
to
indulge
his
newly
acquired
taste
for
gorgeous
effects
without
professional
assistance
i
suppose
so
i
can
see
that
their
house
is
crude
though
i
do
think
that
they
have
some
handsome
things
it
must
be
interesting
to
walk
through
shops
and
say
take
that
just
because
it
pleases
you
during
her
first
marriage
selma
had
found
the
problem
of
dollars
and
cents
a
simple
one
the
income
of
lewis
babcock
was
always
larger
than
the
demands
made
upon
it
and
though
she
kept
house
and
was
familiar
with
the
domestic
disbursements
questions
of
expenditure
solved
themselves
readily
she
had
never
been
obliged
to
ask
herself
whether
they
could
afford
this
or
that
outlay
her
husband
had
been
only
too
eager
to
give
her
anything
she
desired
consideration
of
the
cost
of
things
had
seemed
to
her
beneath
her
notice
and
as
the
concern
of
the
providing
man
rather
than
the
thoughtful
american
wife
and
mother
after
she
had
been
divorced
the
difficulty
in
supplying
herself
readily
with
money
had
been
a
dismaying
incident
of
her
single
life
dismaying
because
it
had
seemed
to
her
a
limitation
unworthy
of
her
aspirations
and
abilities
she
had
married
littleton
because
she
believed
him
her
ideal
of
what
a
man
should
be
but
she
had
been
glad
that
he
would
be
able
to
support
her
and
exempt
her
from
the
necessity
of
asking
what
things
cost
by
the
end
of
their
first
year
and
a
half
of
marriage
selma
realized
that
this
necessity
still
stood
almost
like
a
wolf
at
the
door
between
her
and
the
free
development
of
her
desires
and
aspirations
new
york
prices
were
appalling
the
demands
of
life
in
new
york
still
more
so
they
had
started
on
a
more
elaborate
scale
than
she
had
been
used
to
in
benham
as
babcock
she
had
kept
one
hired
girl
but
in
her
new
kitchen
there
were
two
servants
in
deference
to
the
desire
of
littleton
who
did
not
wish
her
to
perform
the
manual
work
of
the
establishment
men
rarely
appreciate
in
advance
to
the
full
extent
the
extra
cost
of
married
life
and
littleton
though
intending
to
be
prudent
found
his
bills
larger
than
he
had
expected
he
was
able
to
pay
them
promptly
and
without
worry
but
he
was
obliged
to
make
evident
to
selma
that
the
margin
over
and
above
their
carefully
considered
expenses
was
very
small
the
task
of
watching
the
butcher
book
and
the
provision
list
and
thinking
twice
before
making
any
new
outlay
was
something
she
had
not
bargained
for
all
through
her
early
life
as
a
girl
the
question
of
money
had
been
kept
in
the
background
by
the
simplicity
of
her
surroundings
in
her
country
town
at
home
they
had
kept
no
servants
a
woman
relative
had
done
the
work
and
she
had
been
free
to
pursue
her
mental
interests
and
devote
herself
to
her
father
she
had
thought
then
that
the
existence
of
domestic
servants
was
an
act
of
treason
against
the
institutions
of
the
country
by
those
who
kept
them
yet
she
had
accepted
with
glee
the
whom
babcock
had
provided
satisfying
her
own
democratic
scruples
by
dubbing
her
help
and
by
occasionally
offering
her
a
book
to
read
or
catechising
her
as
to
her
moral
needs
there
is
probably
no
one
in
the
civilized
world
more
proud
of
the
possession
of
a
domestic
servant
than
the
american
woman
who
has
never
had
one
and
no
one
more
prompt
to
consign
her
to
the
obscurity
of
the
kitchen
after
a
feeble
pretence
at
making
her
feel
at
home
selma
was
delighted
to
have
two
instead
of
one
and
after
beholding
williams
trig
maids
was
eager
to
see
her
own
arrayed
in
white
caps
and
black
alpaca
dresses
yet
though
she
had
become
keen
to
cultivate
the
new
york
manner
and
had
succeeded
in
reconciling
her
conscience
to
the
possession
of
beautiful
things
by
people
with
a
purpose
it
irked
her
to
feel
that
she
was
hampered
in
living
up
to
her
faith
by
the
bugbear
of
a
lean
purse
she
had
expected
as
wilbur
wife
to
figure
quickly
and
gracefully
in
the
van
of
new
york
intellectual
and
social
progress
instead
she
was
one
among
thousands
living
in
a
new
and
undeveloped
locality
unrecognized
by
the
people
of
whom
she
read
in
the
newspapers
and
without
opportunities
for
displaying
her
own
individuality
and
talents
it
depressed
her
to
see
the
long
lines
of
houses
street
after
street
and
to
think
that
she
was
merely
a
unit
unknown
by
name
in
this
great
sea
of
humanity
she
selma
littleton
american
conscious
of
virtue
and
power
this
must
not
be
and
she
divined
clearer
and
clearer
every
day
that
it
need
not
be
if
she
had
more
money
it
began
to
be
annoying
to
her
that
wilbur
professional
progress
was
not
more
rapid
to
be
sure
he
had
warned
her
that
he
could
not
hope
to
reach
the
front
rank
at
once
that
recognition
must
be
gradual
and
that
he
must
needs
work
slowly
in
order
to
do
himself
justice
she
had
accepted
this
chiefly
as
a
manifestation
of
modesty
not
doubting
that
many
orders
would
be
forthcoming
especially
now
that
he
had
the
new
stimulus
of
her
love
and
inspiration
instead
there
had
been
no
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
his
commissions
moreover
he
had
been
unsuccessful
in
two
out
of
three
competitions
for
minor
public
buildings
for
which
he
had
submitted
designs
from
both
the
pecuniary
and
professional
point
of
view
these
failures
had
been
a
disappointment
he
was
in
good
spirits
and
obviously
happy
and
declared
that
he
was
doing
as
well
as
he
could
reasonably
expect
yet
on
his
discouraged
days
he
admitted
that
the
cost
of
retaining
his
draughtsmen
was
a
drain
on
the
profit
side
of
his
ledger
in
contrast
with
this
the
prosperity
of
her
neighbors
the
williamses
was
a
little
hard
to
bear
the
sudden
friendship
developed
into
neighborly
intimacy
and
she
and
flossy
saw
much
of
each
other
dropping
in
familiarly
and
often
walking
and
shopping
together
the
two
men
were
on
sufficiently
cordial
terms
each
being
tolerant
of
the
limitations
and
seeking
to
recognize
his
good
points
for
the
sake
of
the
bond
between
their
wives
the
return
dinner
was
duly
given
and
selma
hopeless
of
imitating
the
barbaric
splendor
sought
refuge
in
the
reflection
that
the
æsthetic
and
intellectual
atmosphere
of
her
table
would
atone
for
the
lack
of
material
magnificence
and
limited
her
efforts
to
a
few
minor
details
such
as
providing
candles
with
colored
shades
and
some
bonbon
dishes
it
was
plain
that
flossy
admired
her
because
she
recognized
her
to
be
a
fine
and
superior
soul
and
the
appreciation
of
this
served
to
make
it
more
easy
not
to
repine
at
the
difference
between
their
entertainments
still
the
constant
acquisition
of
pretty
things
by
her
frank
and
engaging
friend
was
an
ordeal
which
only
a
soul
endowed
with
high
stern
democratic
faith
and
purpose
could
hope
to
endure
with
equanimity
flossy
bought
new
adornments
for
her
house
and
her
person
with
an
amiable
lavishness
which
required
no
confession
to
demonstrate
that
her
husband
was
making
money
she
made
the
confession
though
from
time
to
time
with
a
bubbling
pride
never
suspecting
that
it
could
harass
or
tempt
her
spiritual
looking
friend
she
prattled
artlessly
of
theatre
parties
followed
by
a
supper
at
one
of
the
fashionable
restaurants
and
of
new
acquaintances
whom
she
entertained
and
through
whom
her
social
circle
was
enlarged
without
divining
that
the
sprightly
narration
was
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
her
hearer
selma
was
capricious
in
her
reception
of
these
reports
of
progress
at
times
she
listened
to
them
with
grave
cold
eyes
which
flossy
took
for
signals
of
noble
disdain
and
sought
to
deprecate
by
wooing
promises
to
be
less
worldly
at
others
she
asked
questions
with
a
feverish
searching
curiosity
which
stimulated
williams
free
and
independent
style
into
running
commentaries
on
the
current
course
of
social
events
and
the
doings
and
idiosyncracies
of
contemporary
leaders
of
fashion
whom
she
had
viewed
from
afar
one
afternoon
selma
saw
from
her
window
flossy
and
her
husband
drive
jubilantly
away
in
a
high
cart
with
yellow
wheels
drawn
by
a
sleek
cob
and
at
the
same
moment
she
became
definitely
aware
that
her
draught
from
the
cup
of
life
had
a
bitter
taste
why
should
these
people
drive
in
their
own
vehicle
rather
than
she
it
seemed
clear
to
her
that
wilbur
could
not
be
making
the
best
use
of
his
talents
and
that
she
had
both
a
grievance
against
him
and
a
sacred
duty
to
perform
in
his
and
her
own
behalf
justice
and
demanded
that
their
mutual
light
should
no
longer
be
hid
under
a
bushel
chapter
pauline
littleton
was
now
established
in
her
new
lodgings
having
been
freed
by
her
brother
marriage
from
the
responsibilities
of
a
housewife
she
was
able
to
concentrate
her
attention
on
the
work
in
which
she
was
interested
her
classes
absorbed
a
large
portion
of
her
time
the
remainder
was
devoted
to
writing
to
girls
in
other
cities
who
sought
her
advice
in
regard
to
courses
of
study
and
to
correspondence
consultation
and
committee
meetings
with
a
group
of
women
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
who
like
herself
were
engrossed
in
educational
matters
she
was
glad
to
have
the
additional
time
thus
afforded
her
for
pursuing
her
own
tastes
and
the
days
seemed
too
short
for
what
she
wished
to
accomplish
she
occupied
two
pleasant
rooms
within
easy
walking
distance
of
her
brother
house
her
classes
took
her
from
home
four
days
in
the
week
and
two
mornings
in
every
seven
were
spent
at
her
desk
with
her
books
and
papers
in
the
agreeable
labor
of
planning
and
correspondence
naturally
one
of
her
chief
desires
was
to
be
on
loving
terms
with
her
brother
wife
and
to
do
everything
in
her
power
to
add
to
happiness
she
summoned
her
women
friends
to
meet
her
at
afternoon
tea
all
of
these
called
on
the
bride
and
some
of
them
invited
her
to
their
houses
they
were
busy
women
like
pauline
herself
intent
in
their
several
ways
on
their
vocations
or
avocations
they
were
disposed
to
extend
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
littleton
whom
they
without
exception
regarded
as
interesting
in
appearance
but
they
had
no
leisure
for
immediate
intimacy
with
her
having
been
introduced
to
her
and
having
scheduled
her
in
their
minds
as
a
new
and
desirable
acquaintance
they
went
their
ways
trusting
chiefly
to
time
to
renew
the
meeting
and
to
supply
the
evidence
as
to
the
stranger
social
value
busy
people
in
a
large
city
are
obliged
to
argue
that
should
win
their
spurs
and
that
great
minds
valuable
opinions
and
moving
social
graces
are
never
crushed
by
inhumanity
but
are
certain
sooner
or
later
to
gain
recognition
therefore
after
being
very
cordial
and
expressing
the
hope
of
seeing
more
of
her
in
the
future
every
one
departed
and
left
selma
to
her
duties
and
her
opportunities
as
littleton
wife
without
having
the
courtesy
to
indicate
that
they
considered
her
a
superior
woman
pauline
regarded
this
behavior
on
the
part
of
her
friends
as
normal
and
having
done
her
social
duty
in
the
afternoon
tea
line
without
a
suspicion
that
selma
was
disappointed
by
the
experience
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
congenial
undertaking
of
becoming
intimate
with
her
she
ascribed
selma
reserve
and
cold
serious
manner
partly
to
shyness
due
to
her
new
surroundings
and
partly
to
the
spiritual
rigor
of
the
puritan
conscience
and
point
of
view
she
had
often
been
told
that
individuals
of
this
temperament
possessed
more
depth
of
character
than
more
emotional
and
socially
facile
people
and
she
was
prepared
to
woo
in
comparison
with
wilbur
pauline
was
accustomed
to
regard
herself
as
a
practical
and
soul
but
she
was
essentially
a
woman
of
fine
and
vigorous
moral
and
mental
purpose
like
many
of
her
associates
in
active
life
however
she
had
become
too
occupied
with
concrete
possibilities
to
be
able
to
give
much
thought
to
her
own
soul
anatomy
and
she
was
glad
to
look
up
to
her
brother
wife
as
a
spiritual
superior
and
to
recognize
that
the
burden
lay
on
herself
to
demonstrate
her
own
worthiness
to
be
admitted
to
close
intimacy
on
equal
terms
wilbur
was
to
her
a
creature
of
light
and
she
had
no
doubt
that
his
wife
was
of
the
same
ethereal
composition
pauline
was
glad
too
of
the
opportunity
really
to
know
a
countrywoman
of
a
type
so
different
from
her
own
friends
she
like
wilbur
had
heard
all
her
life
of
these
interesting
and
inspiring
beings
intense
marvellously
capable
peerless
creatures
panoplied
in
chastity
and
endowed
with
congenital
mental
power
and
bodily
charms
who
were
able
to
cook
educate
children
control
society
and
write
literature
in
the
course
of
the
day
employment
the
newspapers
and
popular
opinion
had
given
her
to
understand
that
these
were
the
true
americans
and
caused
her
to
ask
herself
whether
the
circle
to
which
she
herself
belonged
was
not
retrograde
from
a
nobler
ideal
in
what
way
she
did
not
precisely
understand
except
that
she
and
her
friends
did
not
altogether
disdain
nice
social
usages
and
conventional
womanly
ways
but
nevertheless
the
impression
had
remained
in
her
mind
that
she
must
be
at
fault
somehow
and
it
interested
her
that
she
would
now
be
able
to
understand
wherein
she
was
inferior
she
went
to
see
selma
as
often
as
she
could
and
encouraged
her
to
call
at
her
lodgings
on
the
mornings
when
she
was
at
home
expecting
that
it
might
please
her
to
become
familiar
with
the
budding
educational
enterprises
and
that
thus
a
fresh
bond
of
sympathy
would
be
established
between
them
selma
presented
herself
three
or
four
times
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
months
and
on
the
first
occasion
expressed
gratifying
appreciation
of
the
cosiness
of
the
new
lodgings
i
almost
envy
you
she
said
your
freedom
to
live
your
own
life
and
do
just
what
you
like
it
must
be
delightful
away
up
here
where
you
can
see
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
and
almost
touch
the
sky
and
there
is
no
one
to
disturb
the
current
of
your
thoughts
it
must
be
a
glorious
place
to
work
and
write
i
shall
ask
you
to
let
me
come
up
here
sometimes
when
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
my
own
ideas
as
often
as
you
like
you
shall
have
a
pass
key
i
should
think
said
selma
continuing
to
gaze
with
her
far
away
look
over
the
vista
of
roofs
which
the
top
story
of
the
apartment
house
commanded
that
you
would
be
a
great
deal
happier
than
if
you
had
married
him
the
pause
which
ensued
caused
her
to
look
round
and
add
jauntily
i
have
heard
you
know
about
dr
page
a
wave
of
crimson
spread
over
pauline
face
the
crimson
of
wounded
surprise
which
froze
selma
genial
intentions
to
the
core
i
did
think
you
mind
talking
about
it
she
said
stiffly
there
nothing
to
talk
about
since
you
have
mentioned
it
dr
page
is
a
dear
friend
of
mine
and
will
always
continue
to
be
i
hope
oh
i
knew
you
were
nothing
but
friends
now
selma
answered
she
felt
wounded
in
her
turn
she
had
come
with
the
wish
to
be
gracious
and
companionable
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
a
happy
thought
to
congratulate
pauline
on
the
wisdom
of
her
decision
she
did
not
like
people
who
were
not
ready
to
be
communicative
and
discuss
their
intimate
concerns
the
episode
impaired
the
success
of
the
first
morning
visit
at
the
next
which
occurred
a
fortnight
later
pauline
announced
that
she
had
a
piece
of
interesting
news
do
you
know
a
joel
flagg
in
benham
i
know
who
he
is
said
selma
i
have
met
his
daughter
it
seems
he
has
made
a
fortune
in
oil
and
real
estate
and
is
desirous
to
build
a
college
for
women
in
memory
of
his
mother
sarah
wetmore
one
of
my
friends
has
just
received
a
letter
from
a
hallett
taylor
to
whom
flagg
appears
to
have
applied
for
counsel
and
who
wishes
some
of
us
who
are
interested
in
educational
matters
to
serve
as
an
advisory
committee
probably
you
know
taylor
too
oh
yes
i
have
been
at
her
house
and
i
served
with
her
on
the
committee
which
awarded
wilbur
the
church
why
then
you
are
the
very
person
to
tell
us
all
about
her
i
think
i
remember
now
having
heard
wilbur
mention
her
name
wilbur
fancied
her
i
believe
your
tone
rather
implies
that
you
did
not
you
must
tell
me
everything
you
know
my
friend
has
corresponded
with
her
before
in
regard
to
some
artistic
matters
but
she
has
never
met
her
her
letter
suggests
a
lady
i
dare
say
you
would
like
taylor
said
selma
gravely
she
is
attractive
i
suppose
and
seemed
to
know
more
or
less
about
european
art
and
pictures
but
we
in
benham
did
consider
her
exactly
an
american
if
you
really
wish
to
know
my
opinion
i
think
that
she
was
too
exclusive
a
person
to
have
fine
ideas
that
a
pity
if
she
lived
in
new
york
she
would
like
to
be
one
of
those
society
ladies
who
live
on
fifth
avenue
only
she
has
really
any
conception
of
what
true
elegance
is
her
house
there
except
for
the
ornaments
she
had
bought
abroad
was
not
so
well
furnished
as
the
one
i
lived
in
i
wonder
what
she
would
think
if
she
could
look
into
the
of
my
friend
mrs
williams
i
see
said
pauline
though
in
truth
she
was
puzzled
i
am
sorry
if
she
is
a
fine
lady
but
people
like
that
when
they
become
interested
are
often
excellent
workers
it
is
a
noble
gift
of
flagg
as
a
foundation
fund
he
a
good
american
at
all
events
wilbur
must
certainly
compete
for
the
buildings
and
his
having
first
met
you
there
ought
to
be
an
inspiration
to
him
to
do
fine
work
selma
had
been
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
criticise
hallett
taylor
whom
she
had
learned
by
the
light
of
her
superior
social
knowledge
to
regard
as
an
unimportant
person
yet
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
righteous
impulse
in
saying
what
she
thought
of
her
she
knew
that
she
had
never
liked
taylor
and
she
was
not
pleased
to
hear
that
flagg
had
selected
her
from
among
the
women
of
benham
to
superintend
the
administration
of
his
splendid
gift
benham
had
come
to
seem
to
her
remote
and
primitive
yet
she
preferred
and
was
in
the
mood
to
think
that
it
represented
the
principles
which
were
dear
to
her
and
that
she
had
been
appreciated
there
far
better
than
in
her
present
sphere
she
was
still
tied
to
benham
by
correspondence
with
earle
selma
had
written
at
once
to
explain
her
sudden
departure
and
letters
passed
between
them
at
intervals
of
a
few
weeks
letters
on
selma
part
fluent
with
dazzled
metropolitan
condescension
yet
containing
every
now
and
then
a
stern
charge
against
her
new
on
the
score
of
levity
and
worldliness
the
donation
for
the
establishment
of
wetmore
college
was
made
shortly
after
another
institution
for
the
education
of
women
in
which
pauline
was
interested
everdean
college
had
been
opened
to
students
the
number
of
applicants
for
admission
to
everdean
had
been
larger
than
the
authorities
had
anticipated
and
pauline
who
had
been
one
of
the
promoters
and
most
active
workers
in
raising
funds
for
and
supervising
the
construction
of
this
labor
of
love
was
jubilant
over
the
outlook
and
busy
in
regard
to
a
variety
of
new
matters
presented
for
solution
by
the
suddenly
evolved
needs
of
the
situation
among
these
was
the
acquisition
of
two
or
three
new
women
instructors
and
it
occurred
to
pauline
at
once
that
selma
might
know
of
some
desirable
candidate
selma
appeared
to
manifest
but
little
interest
in
this
inquiry
at
the
time
but
a
few
months
subsequent
to
their
conversation
in
regard
to
taylor
she
presented
herself
at
pauline
rooms
one
morning
with
the
announcement
that
she
had
found
some
one
pauline
who
was
busy
at
her
desk
asked
permission
to
finish
a
letter
before
listening
so
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
selma
who
wore
a
new
costume
of
a
more
fashionable
guise
than
her
last
reflected
while
she
waited
that
the
details
of
such
work
as
occupied
her
must
be
tedious
indeed
she
had
begun
to
entertain
of
late
a
sort
of
contempt
for
the
deliberate
delving
processes
of
the
littletons
she
was
inclined
to
ask
herself
if
wilbur
and
pauline
were
not
both
plodders
her
own
idea
of
doing
things
was
to
do
them
quickly
and
brilliantly
arriving
at
conclusions
as
became
an
american
with
prompt
energy
and
despatch
it
seemed
to
her
that
wilbur
in
his
work
was
slow
and
elaborate
disposed
to
hesitate
and
refine
instead
of
producing
boldly
and
immediately
and
his
sister
with
her
studies
and
suggested
the
same
wearisome
tendency
why
should
not
wilbur
in
his
line
act
with
the
confident
enterprise
and
capacity
to
produce
immediate
ostensible
results
which
their
neighbor
gregory
williams
displayed
as
for
pauline
of
course
she
had
not
wilbur
talent
and
could
not
perhaps
be
expected
to
shine
conspicuously
but
surely
she
might
make
more
of
herself
if
only
she
would
cease
to
spend
so
much
time
in
details
and
cogitation
with
nothing
tangible
to
show
for
her
labor
selma
remembered
her
own
experience
as
a
small
school
teacher
and
her
thankfulness
at
her
escape
from
a
petty
task
unworthy
of
her
capabilities
and
she
smiled
scornfully
to
herself
as
she
sat
waiting
at
what
she
regarded
pauline
willingness
to
spend
her
energies
in
such
inconspicuous
work
indeed
when
pauline
had
finished
her
letter
and
announced
that
she
was
now
entirely
at
leisure
selma
felt
impelled
to
remark
i
should
think
pauline
that
you
would
give
a
course
of
lectures
on
education
we
should
be
glad
to
have
them
at
our
house
and
your
friends
ought
to
be
able
to
dispose
of
a
great
many
tickets
such
a
thing
had
never
occurred
to
selma
until
this
moment
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
she
heard
her
own
words
a
brilliant
suggestion
both
as
a
step
forward
for
pauline
and
a
social
opportunity
for
herself
on
education
my
dear
selma
you
have
no
idea
of
the
depths
of
my
ignorance
education
is
an
enormous
subject
and
i
am
just
beginning
to
realize
how
little
i
know
concerning
it
people
have
talked
and
written
about
education
enough
what
we
need
and
what
some
of
us
are
trying
to
do
is
to
study
statistics
and
observe
results
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
should
only
make
myself
a
i
do
think
you
would
you
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
learning
about
education
and
you
must
have
interesting
things
to
say
you
are
too
modest
and
do
you
think
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
quite
enterprising
enough
a
course
of
lectures
would
call
public
attention
to
you
and
you
would
get
ahead
faster
perhaps
i
think
that
you
and
wilbur
are
both
inclined
to
hide
your
light
under
a
bushel
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
be
conscientious
and
live
up
to
one
ideals
without
neglecting
one
opportunities
the
difficulty
is
said
pauline
with
a
laugh
that
i
regard
it
as
an
opportunity
and
i
am
sure
it
would
help
me
to
get
ahead
as
you
call
it
with
the
people
i
desire
to
impress
to
give
afternoon
tea
or
lectures
i
do
know
enough
to
lecture
effectively
as
to
enterprise
i
am
busy
from
morning
until
night
what
more
can
a
woman
do
you
must
hurry
wilbur
selma
all
he
needs
is
time
to
let
the
world
see
his
light
very
likely
of
course
if
you
do
consider
that
you
know
enough
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
i
thought
of
it
because
i
used
to
lecture
in
benham
at
the
benham
institute
and
i
am
sure
it
helped
me
to
get
ahead
i
used
to
think
a
great
deal
about
educational
matters
and
perhaps
i
will
set
you
the
example
by
giving
some
lectures
myself
that
would
be
very
interesting
if
a
person
has
new
ideas
and
has
confidence
in
them
it
is
natural
to
wish
to
let
the
world
hear
them
pauline
spoke
amiably
but
she
was
disposed
to
regard
her
sister
with
more
critical
eyes
she
felt
no
annoyance
at
the
patronizing
tone
toward
herself
but
the
reference
to
wilbur
made
her
blood
rebel
still
she
could
not
bear
to
harbor
distrust
against
that
grave
face
with
its
delicate
beauty
and
spiritualized
air
which
was
becomingly
accommodated
to
metropolitan
conditions
by
a
more
festive
bonnet
than
any
which
she
herself
owned
yet
she
noticed
that
the
thin
lips
had
an
expression
of
discontent
and
she
wondered
why
recurring
to
the
errand
on
which
she
had
come
selma
explained
that
she
had
just
received
a
letter
from
benham
from
her
friend
margaret
rodney
earle
an
authoress
and
a
promulgator
of
advanced
and
original
ideas
in
respect
to
the
cause
of
womanhood
asking
if
she
happened
to
know
of
an
opening
for
a
gifted
young
lady
in
any
branch
of
intellectual
work
i
thought
at
once
of
everdean
said
selma
and
have
come
to
give
you
the
opportunity
of
securing
her
pauline
expressed
her
thanks
cordially
and
inquired
if
earle
had
referred
to
the
candidate
experience
or
special
fitness
for
the
duties
of
the
position
she
writes
that
she
is
very
clever
and
gifted
i
did
not
bring
the
letter
with
me
but
i
think
earle
language
was
that
miss
bailey
will
perform
brilliantly
any
duties
which
may
be
intrusted
to
her
that
is
rather
general
said
pauline
i
am
sorry
that
she
specify
what
miss
bailey
education
has
been
and
whether
she
has
taught
elsewhere
earle
would
have
recommended
her
if
she
had
felt
sure
that
she
was
well
educated
i
remember
seeing
her
at
the
benham
institute
on
one
of
the
last
occasions
when
i
was
present
she
delivered
a
whistling
solo
which
every
one
thought
clever
and
melodious
i
dare
say
she
is
just
the
person
we
are
looking
for
said
pauline
leniently
it
happens
that
grainger
my
friend
to
whom
taylor
wrote
concerning
flagg
gift
is
to
make
taylor
a
visit
at
benham
next
week
in
order
to
consider
the
steps
to
be
taken
in
regard
to
wetmore
college
she
and
miss
bailey
can
arrange
to
meet
and
that
will
save
miss
bailey
the
expense
of
a
journey
to
new
york
at
the
possible
risk
of
disappointment
i
thought
said
selma
that
you
would
consider
yourselves
fortunate
to
secure
her
services
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
very
fortunate
selma
but
we
can
not
engage
her
without
seeing
her
and
testing
her
qualifications
selma
made
no
further
demur
at
the
delay
but
she
was
obviously
surprised
and
piqued
that
her
offer
should
be
treated
in
this
elaborate
fashion
she
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
could
not
reasonably
expect
pauline
to
make
a
definite
decision
without
further
inquiry
but
she
had
expected
to
be
able
to
report
to
earle
that
the
matter
was
as
good
as
settled
that
if
miss
bailey
would
give
a
few
particulars
as
to
her
accomplishments
the
position
would
be
hers
surely
she
and
earle
were
qualified
to
choose
a
here
was
another
instance
of
the
littleton
tendency
to
waste
time
on
unimportant
details
she
reasoned
that
a
woman
with
more
perceptions
would
have
recognized
the
opportunity
as
unusual
and
would
have
snapped
up
miss
bailey
on
the
spot
the
sequel
was
more
serious
neither
selma
nor
pauline
spoke
of
the
matter
for
a
month
then
it
was
broached
by
pauline
who
wrote
a
few
lines
to
the
effect
that
she
was
sorry
to
report
that
the
authorities
of
everdean
after
investigation
had
concluded
not
to
engage
the
services
of
miss
bailey
as
instructor
when
selma
read
the
note
her
cheeks
burned
with
resentment
she
regarded
the
decision
as
an
affront
pauline
dined
with
them
on
the
evening
of
that
day
and
at
table
selma
was
cold
and
formal
when
the
two
women
were
alone
selma
said
at
once
with
an
attempt
at
calmness
what
fault
do
you
find
with
my
candidate
i
think
it
possible
that
she
might
have
been
satisfactory
from
the
mere
point
of
scholarship
judicially
answered
pauline
who
did
not
realize
in
the
least
that
her
was
offended
though
grainger
stopped
short
of
close
inquiry
on
that
score
for
the
reason
that
miss
bailey
failed
to
satisfy
our
requirements
in
another
respect
i
wish
to
imply
by
what
i
am
going
to
say
anything
against
her
character
or
her
capacity
for
usefulness
as
a
teacher
under
certain
conditions
but
i
confide
to
you
frankly
selma
that
we
make
it
an
absolute
condition
in
the
choice
of
instructors
for
our
students
that
they
should
be
first
of
all
in
thought
and
speech
and
here
it
was
that
she
fell
short
of
course
i
have
never
seen
miss
bailey
but
grainger
reported
that
she
was
er
impossible
you
mean
that
your
friend
does
not
consider
her
a
lady
she
is
a
society
lady
but
i
did
not
suppose
an
american
girl
would
be
refused
a
position
as
a
teacher
for
such
a
reason
as
that
a
lady
is
a
lady
whether
she
is
what
you
term
a
society
lady
or
not
grainger
told
us
that
miss
bailey
appearance
and
manners
did
not
suggest
the
womanly
refinement
which
we
deem
indispensable
in
those
who
are
to
teach
our
college
students
five
years
ago
only
scholarship
and
cleverness
were
demanded
but
experience
has
taught
the
educators
of
women
that
this
was
a
mistake
i
presume
said
selma
with
dramatic
scorn
that
hallett
taylor
disapproved
of
her
i
thought
there
would
be
some
such
outcome
when
i
heard
that
she
was
to
be
consulted
taylor
name
was
not
mentioned
answered
pauline
in
astonishment
i
had
no
idea
selma
that
you
regarded
this
as
a
personal
matter
you
told
me
that
you
had
seen
miss
bailey
but
once
i
am
interested
in
her
because
because
i
do
not
like
to
see
a
cruel
wrong
done
you
do
not
understand
her
you
allow
a
prejudice

to
interfere
with
her
career
and
the
opportunity
to
display
her
abilities
you
should
have
trusted
earle
pauline
she
is
my
friend
and
she
recommended
miss
bailey
because
she
believed
in
her
it
is
a
reflection
on
me
and
my
friends
to
intimate
that
she
is
not
a
lady
she
bent
forward
from
the
sofa
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
lips
tightly
compressed
for
a
moment
she
gazed
angrily
at
the
bewildered
pauline
then
as
though
she
had
suddenly
bethought
her
of
her
new
york
manner
she
drew
herself
up
and
said
with
a
forced
laugh
if
the
reason
you
give
were
not
so
ridiculous
i
should
be
seriously
offended
offended
offended
with
pauline
exclaimed
littleton
who
entered
the
room
at
the
moment
it
can
not
be
that
my
two
guardian
angels
have
had
a
falling
out
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
brightly
as
if
it
were
really
a
joke
it
is
nothing
said
selma
it
seems
said
pauline
with
fervor
that
i
have
unintentionally
hurt
selma

it
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
wish
to
do
and
i
trust
that
when
she
thinks
the

over
she
will
realize
that

chapter
vi
why
do
you
follow
the
advice
of
williams
and
buy
some
shares
of
stock
asked
selma
lightly
yet
coaxingly
of
her
husband
one
day
in
the
third
year
of
their
marriage
the
williamses
were
dining
with
them
at
the
time
and
a
statement
by
gregory
not
altogether
without
motive
as
to
the
profits
made
by
several
people
who
had
taken
his
advice
called
forth
the
question
he
and
his
wife
were
amiably
inclined
toward
the
littletons
and
were
proud
of
the
acquaintance
among
their
other
friends
they
boasted
of
the
delightful
excursions
into
the
literary
circle
which
the
intimacy
afforded
them
they
both
would
have
been
pleased
to
see
their
neighbors
more
amply
provided
with
money
and
gregory
partly
at
the
instance
of
flossy
partly
from
sheer
in
order
to
give
a
deserving
but
impractical
fellow
a
chance
to
better
himself
threw
out
tips
from
time
to
time
crumbs
from
the
rich
table
but
bestowed
in
a
friendly
spirit
whenever
they
were
let
fall
selma
would
look
at
wilbur
hoping
for
a
sign
of
interest
but
hitherto
they
had
evoked
merely
a
smile
of
refusal
or
had
been
utterly
ignored
her
own
question
had
been
put
on
several
occasions
both
in
the
company
of
the
tempter
and
in
the
privacy
of
the
domestic
hearth
and
both
in
the
gayly
suggestive
and
the
pensively
argumentative
key
why
might
they
not
by
means
of
a
clever
purchase
in
the
stock
market
occasionally
procure
some
of
the
agreeable
extra
pleasures
of
life
provide
the
ready
money
for
theatres
a
larger
wardrobe
trips
from
home
or
a
modest
equipage
why
not
take
advantage
of
the
friendly
advice
given
williams
had
made
clear
that
the
purchase
of
stocks
on
a
sufficient
margin
was
no
more
reprehensible
as
a
moral
proposition
than
the
purchase
of
cargoes
of
sugar
cotton
coffee
or
tea
against
which
merchants
borrowed
money
at
the
bank
in
neither
instance
did
the
purchaser
own
outright
what
he
sought
to
sell
at
an
advance
merely
in
one
case
it
was
shares
in
the
other
merchandise
of
course
it
was
foolish
for
inexperienced
country
folk
with
small
means
to
dabble
in
stocks
and
bonds
but
why
should
not
city
people
who
were
clever
and
had
clever
friends
in
the
business
eke
out
the
cost
of
living
by
shrewd
investments
in
an
sense
it
might
be
considered
gambling
but
if
it
were
true
as
wilbur
and
williams
both
maintained
that
the
american
people
were
addicted
to
speculation
was
not
the
existence
of
the
habit
strong
evidence
that
the
prejudice
against
it
must
be
the
logical
and
the
patriotic
conclusion
must
needs
be
that
business
methods
had
changed
and
that
the
american
nation
had
been
clever
enough
to
substitute
dealings
in
shares
of
stock
and
in
contracts
relating
to
cereals
and
merchandise
for
the
methods
of
their
grandfathers
who
delivered
the
properties
in
bulk
to
this
condensation
of
gregory
glib
sophistries
on
the
lips
of
his
wife
wilbur
had
seemed
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
it
did
not
occur
to
him
at
first
that
selma
was
seriously
in
earnest
he
regarded
her
suggestions
of
neglected
opportunities
which
were
often
whimsically
uttered
as
more
than
half
playful
a
sort
of
envy
of
the
meteoric
progress
in
magnificence
of
their
friendly
neighbors
he
was
even
glad
that
she
should
show
herself
appreciative
of
the
merits
of
civilized
comfort
for
he
had
been
afraid
lest
her
ascetic
scruples
would
lead
her
judgments
too
far
in
the
opposite
direction
he
welcomed
them
and
encouraged
her
small
schemes
to
make
the
establishment
more
festive
and
stylish
in
appearance
in
modest
imitation
of
the
splendor
next
door
but
constant
and
more
sombre
reference
to
the
growing
fortunes
of
the
williamses
presently
attracted
his
attention
and
made
him
more
observant
his
income
sufficed
to
pay
the
ordinary
expenses
of
quiet
domestic
life
and
to
leave
a
small
margin
for
carefully
considered
amusements
but
he
reflected
that
if
selma
were
yearning
for
greater
luxury
he
could
not
afford
at
present
to
increase
materially
her
allowance
it
grieved
him
as
a
proud
man
to
think
that
the
woman
he
loved
should
lack
any
thing
she
desired
and
without
a
thought
of
distrust
he
applied
himself
more
strenuously
to
his
work
hoping
that
the
sum
of
his
commissions
would
enable
him
presently
to
gratify
some
of
her
hankerings
such
for
instance
as
the
possession
of
a
horse
and
vehicle
selma
had
several
times
alluded
with
a
sigh
to
the
satisfaction
there
must
be
in
driving
in
the
new
park
babcock
had
kept
a
horse
and
the
williamses
now
drove
past
the
windows
daily
in
a
phaeton
drawn
by
two
iron
gray
champing
steeds
he
said
to
himself
that
he
could
scarcely
blame
selma
if
she
coveted
now
and
then
flossy
fine
possessions
and
the
thought
that
she
was
not
altogether
happy
in
consequence
of
his
failure
to
earn
more
kept
recurring
to
his
mind
and
worried
him
no
children
had
been
born
to
them
and
he
pictured
with
growing
concern
his
wife
lonely
at
home
on
this
account
yet
without
extra
income
to
make
purchases
which
might
enable
her
to
forget
at
times
that
there
was
no
baby
in
the
house
flossy
had
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
two
gorgeously
bedizened
little
beings
who
were
trundled
along
the
sidewalk
in
a
black
highly
varnished
which
was
reputed
by
the
dealer
who
sold
it
to
gregory
to
have
belonged
to
an
english
nobleman
wilbur
more
than
once
detected
selma
looking
at
the
babies
with
a
wistful
glance
she
was
really
admiring
their
clothes
yet
the
thought
of
how
prettily
she
would
have
been
able
to
dress
a
baby
of
her
own
was
at
times
so
pathetic
as
to
bring
tears
to
her
eyes
and
cause
her
to
deplore
her
own
lack
of
children
as
a
misfortune
as
the
weeks
slipped
away
and
wilbur
realized
that
though
he
was
gaining
ground
in
his
profession
more
liberal
expenditures
were
still
out
of
the
question
he
reached
a
frame
of
mind
which
made
him
yearn
for
a
means
of
relief
so
it
happened
that
when
selma
asked
him
once
more
why
he
did
not
follow
the
advice
proffered
and
buy
some
stocks
he
replied
by
smiling
at
gregory
and
inquiring
what
he
should
buy
during
the
dinner
which
had
been
pleasant
wilbur
eye
had
been
attracted
by
the
brilliancy
of
some
new
jewels
which
williams
wore
and
he
had
been
conscious
of
the
wish
that
he
were
able
to
make
a
present
like
that
to
his
own
wife
you
take
my
breath
away
wonders
will
never
cease
responded
gregory
while
both
the
women
clapped
their
hands
but
you
mus
buy
anything
you
must
sell
he
continued
vanhorne
and
i
both
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
time
for
a
turn
on
the
short
side
of
the
market
when
the
public
are
crazy
and
will
buy
any
thing
then
is
the
time
to
let
them
have
all
they
wish
what
then
am
i
to
sell
asked
wilbur
i
am
a
complete
lamb
you
know
he
was
already
sorry
that
he
had
consented
but
selma
manifest
interest
restrained
him
from
turning
the
matter
into
a
joke
leave
it
all
to
me
said
williams
with
a
magnificent
gesture
but
you
will
need
some
money
from
me
not
at
all
if
you
would
feel
better
you
may
send
me
a
check
or
a
bond
for
a
thousand
dollars
but
it
is
necessary
in
your
case
i
will
bring
you
in
a
bond
one
of
the
very
few
i
own
wilbur
having
delivered
his
security
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
heard
nothing
further
from
williams
for
a
fortnight
one
day
he
received
a
formal
account
of
certain
transactions
executed
by
williams
and
vanhorne
for
wilbur
littleton
and
a
check
for
two
thousand
dollars
the
flush
which
rose
to
his
cheeks
was
induced
partly
by
pleasure
partly
by
shame
his
inclination
as
he
reflected
was
to
return
the
check
but
he
recognized
presently
that
this
was
a
foolish
idea
and
that
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
deposit
it
he
wrote
a
grateful
note
of
acknowledgment
to
williams
and
then
gave
himself
up
to
the
agreeable
occupation
of
thinking
what
he
should
buy
for
selma
with
the
money
he
decided
not
to
tell
her
of
his
good
fortune
but
to
treat
her
to
a
surprise
his
first
fancy
was
in
favor
of
jewelry
some
necklace
or
lustrous
ornament
for
the
hair
which
would
charm
the
feminine
eye
and
might
make
selma
even
more
beautiful
than
she
already
appeared
in
evening
dress
his
choice
settled
on
a
horse
and
buggy
as
more
genuinely
useful
to
be
sure
there
was
the
feed
of
the
animal
to
be
considered
but
he
would
be
able
to
reserve
sufficient
money
to
cover
this
cost
for
some
months
and
by
the
end
of
that
time
he
would
perhaps
be
able
to
afford
the
outlay
from
his
income
and
vehicles
were
not
in
his
line
but
he
succeeded
by
investigation
in
procuring
a
modest
equipment
for
seven
hundred
dollars
which
left
him
three
hundred
for
fodder
and
the
other
thousand
this
he
had
decided
to
hand
over
to
selma
as
pin
money
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
consented
to
speculate
and
it
seemed
meet
that
she
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
spending
it
he
carried
out
his
surprise
by
appearing
one
afternoon
before
the
door
and
inviting
her
to
drive
selma
became
radiant
at
the
news
that
the
horse
and
buggy
were
hers
though
when
the
particulars
of
the
purchase
were
disclosed
she
said
to
herself
that
she
wished
wilbur
had
allowed
her
to
choose
the
vehicle
she
would
have
preferred
one
more
stylish
and
less
domestic
looking
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
gave
him
a
kiss
on
their
return
to
show
her
satisfaction
you
see
how
easy
it
is
wilbur
she
said
as
she
surveyed
the
check
which
he
had
handed
her
it
was
not
i
it
was
williams
no
but
you
could
if
you
would
only
think
so
i
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
you
dear
she
added
looking
eagerly
into
his
face
but
do
you
sometimes
go
out
of
your
way
to
avoid
what
is
enterprising
and
er
modern
just
because
it
is
modern
gambling
is
as
old
as
the
hills
selma
yes
and
if
this
were
gambling
the
sort
of
gambling
you
mean
do
you
think
i
would
allow
you
to
do
it
do
you
think
the
american
people
would
tolerate
it
for
a
minute
she
asked
triumphantly
it
seems
to
me
that
your
admiration
for
the
american
people
sometimes
makes
you
a
little
weak
in
your
logic
he
answered
with
he
was
so
pleased
by
selma
gratification
that
he
was
disposed
to
exorcise
his
scruples
i
have
always
told
you
that
i
was
more
of
a
patriot
than
you
wilbur
the
bond
had
not
been
returned
by
williams
at
the
time
he
sent
the
money
and
some
fortnight
later
only
a
few
days
in
fact
after
this
drive
littleton
received
another
cheque
for
and
a
request
that
he
call
at
the
office
i
thought
you
would
like
to
see
the
instruments
of
torture
at
work
the
process
of
in
active
operation
williams
explained
as
he
shook
hands
and
waved
him
into
his
private
room
after
a
few
easy
remarks
on
the
methods
of
doing
business
the
broker
continued
i
flatter
myself
that
for
so
small
an
investment
and
so
short
a
time
i
have
done
tolerably
well
for
you
i
scarcely
know
how
to
express
my
thanks
and
my
admiration
for
your
skill
indeed
i
feel
rather
awkwardly
about
that
all
right
my
dear
fellow
it
my
business
i
get
my
commission
still
i
admit
friendly
regard
and
this
is
why
i
suggested
your
dropping
in
by
introducing
the
personal
equation
makes
one
nervous
if
instead
of
closing
out
your
account
i
had
in
each
instance
held
on
you
would
have
made
more
money
i
was
glad
to
take
this
responsibility
at
first
because
you
were
a
neophyte
at
the
business
but
i
think
it
will
be
more
satisfactory
both
for
you
and
for
me
that
in
future
transactions
you
should
give
me
the
word
when
to
reap
the
profit
of
course
you
shall
have
all
the
information
which
i
possess
and
my
advice
will
be
at
your
command
but
where
a
man
money
is
concerned
his
own
head
is
apt
to
be
the
wisest
counsellor
now
i
took
the
liberty
yesterday
of
selling
for
you
two
hundred
shares
of
reading
railroad
you
can
cover
at
a
profit
of
one
point
about
i
do
not
urge
it
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
the
market
barring
occasional
rallies
is
still
on
the
downward
track
i
wish
however
to
put
you
in
a
position
where
you
can
if
you
desire
take
advantage
of
the
full
opportunities
of
the
financial
situation
and
save
myself
from
feeling
that
i
have
robbed
you
by
my
friendly
caution
in
other
words
you
do
wish
to
speculate
with
my
money
said
littleton
you
wish
me
to
paddle
my
own
canoe
williams
real
desire
was
to
escape
the
bother
of
personally
superintending
an
insignificant
account
his
circumlocution
was
a
suave
way
of
stating
that
he
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
of
a
neighbor
and
benevolent
friend
and
that
the
ordinary
relation
of
broker
and
customer
ought
now
be
established
as
for
littleton
he
perceived
that
he
was
not
free
to
retire
from
the
market
on
the
profits
of
friendly
regard
unless
he
was
prepared
to
fly
in
the
face
of
advice
and
buy
in
his
two
hundred
reading
railroad
to
do
so
would
be
pusillanimous
moreover
to
retire
and
abstain
from
further
dealings
would
make
williams
two
cheques
more
obviously
a
charitable
donation
and
the
thought
of
them
was
becoming
galling
above
all
there
were
feelings
to
be
considered
the
possession
of
the
means
to
afford
her
happiness
was
already
a
sweet
argument
in
favor
of
further
experiments
and
so
it
happened
that
during
the
next
nine
months
littleton
became
a
frequenter
of
the
office
of
williams
vanhorne
he
was
not
among
those
who
hung
over
the
tape
and
were
to
be
seen
there
daily
but
he
found
himself
attracted
as
the
needle
by
the
magnet
to
look
in
once
or
twice
a
week
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
market
his
ventures
continued
to
be
small
and
were
conducted
under
the
ken
of
williams
and
though
the
occasional
rallies
referred
to
by
the
broker
harassed
wilbur
spirit
when
they
occurred
the
policy
of
selling
short
proved
reasonably
remunerative
in
the
course
of
half
a
dozen
separate
speculations
in
round
figures
he
added
another
to
that
which
williams
had
made
for
him
the
process
kept
him
on
pins
and
needles
and
led
him
to
scan
the
list
of
stock
quotations
before
reading
anything
else
in
the
newspaper
selma
was
delighted
at
his
success
and
though
he
chose
not
to
tell
her
the
details
of
his
dealings
she
watched
him
furtively
followed
the
general
tendency
of
the
market
and
when
she
perceived
that
he
was
in
good
spirits
satisfied
sufficiently
her
curiosity
by
questions
on
the
strength
of
this
addition
to
their
pecuniary
resources
selma
branched
out
into
sundry
mild
extravagances
she
augmented
her
wardrobe
engaged
an
additional
and
a
more
expensive
cook
and
entertained
with
greater
freedom
and
elaboration
she
was
fond
of
going
to
the
theatre
and
supping
afterward
at
some
fashionable
restaurant
where
she
could
show
her
new
plumage
and
be
a
part
of
the
gay
chattering
rout
at
the
tables
consuming
crabs
and
champagne
she
was
gradually
increasing
her
acquaintance
chiefly
among
the
friends
of
the
williamses
people
who
were
fond
of
display
and
luxury
and
who
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
in
this
connection
she
was
glad
to
avail
herself
of
the
reputation
of
belonging
to
the
literary
circle
and
she
conceived
the
plan
of
mingling
these
new
associates
with
wilbur
former
set
to
her
thinking
a
delightful
scheme
which
she
inaugurated
by
means
of
a
dinner
party
she
included
among
the
guests
pauline
and
dr
page
and
considered
that
she
had
acted
gracefully
in
putting
them
side
by
side
at
table
thus
sacrificing
the
theory
of
her
entertainment
to
her
feminine
interest
in
romance
in
her
opinion
it
was
more
than
pauline
deserved
and
she
was
proud
of
her
generosity
there
were
fourteen
in
the
company
and
after
dinner
they
were
regaled
by
a
young
woman
who
had
brought
a
letter
of
introduction
to
selma
from
earle
who
read
from
her
own
poems
the
dinner
was
given
for
her
and
her
seat
was
between
wilbur
and
dennison
the
magazine
editor
selma
had
attended
a
at
the
williamses
a
fortnight
earlier
where
there
had
been
music
in
the
by
a
at
a
cost
of
so
flossy
had
told
her
in
confidence
a
poetess
reading
from
her
own
works
a
guest
and
not
invited
in
after
dinner
on
a
business
footing
appealed
to
selma
as
more
american
and
less
expensive
she
in
her
secret
soul
would
have
liked
to
recite
herself
but
she
feared
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
new
york
manner
the
verses
were
intense
in
character
and
were
delivered
by
the
young
woman
with
a
fervor
which
as
one
of
the
wing
of
the
company
stated
made
one
creep
and
weep
alternately
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
entertainment
was
novel
and
acceptable
to
the
commercial
element
and
to
selma
it
seemed
a
delightful
reminder
of
the
benham
institute
she
was
curious
to
know
what
dennison
thought
though
she
said
to
herself
that
she
did
not
really
care
she
felt
that
anything
free
and
earnest
in
the
literary
line
was
likely
to
be
frowned
on
by
the
coterie
to
which
her
husband
people
belonged
nevertheless
she
seized
an
opportunity
to
ask
the
editor
if
he
did
not
think
the
verses
remarkable
they
are
certainly
remarkable
answered
dennison
after
a
brief
pause
he
added
being
a
strictly
truthful
person
littleton
i
do
not
wish
to
seek
shelter
behind
the
rampart
which
your
word
affords
a
dinner
may
be
remarkable
remarkably
good
like
the
one
i
have
just
eaten
or
remarkably
bad
some
editors
would
have
replied
to
you
as
i
have
done
and
yet
been
capable
of
a
mental
reservation
unflattering
to
the
ambitious
young
woman
to
whom
we
have
been
listening
but
without
wishing
to
express
an
opinion
let
me
remind
you
that
poetry
like
needs
close
scrutiny
before
its
merits
can
be
defined
i
thought
i
recognized
some
ancient
and
flowers
of
speech
but
my
editorial
ear
and
eye
may
have
been
deceived
she
has
beautiful
hair
at
all
events
tresses
man
imperial
race
ensnare
and
beauty
draws
us
by
a
single
hair
you
cynical
personage
i
only
hope
she
may
prove
a
genius
and
that
you
will
realize
when
too
late
that
you
might
have
discovered
her
said
selma
looking
into
his
face
brightly
with
a
knowing
smile
and
tapping
her
fan
against
her
hand
she
was
in
a
gay
humor
at
the
success
of
the
entertainment
despite
the
attitude
of
this
censor
and
pleased
at
the
appositeness
of
her
quotation
her
figure
had
filled
out
since
her
marriage
she
was
almost
plump
and
she
wore
a
single
short
fat
curl
pendent
behind
her
ear
a
few
months
subsequent
to
this
dinner
party
flossy
announced
one
day
that
silas
parsons
whom
selma
had
seen
with
the
williamses
at
the
theatre
nearly
three
years
before
had
come
to
live
in
new
york
with
his
wife
and
daughter
flossy
referred
to
him
eagerly
as
one
of
her
husband
most
valuable
customers
a
shrewd
sensible
western
business
man
who
had
made
money
in
patent
machinery
and
was
superbly
rich
he
had
gone
temporarily
to
a
hotel
but
he
was
intending
to
build
a
large
house
on
fifth
avenue
near
the
park
selma
heard
this
announcement
with
keen
interest
asking
herself
at
once
why
wilbur
should
not
be
the
architect
why
not
indeed
she
promptly
reasoned
that
here
was
her
chance
to
aid
her
husband
that
he
if
left
to
his
own
devices
would
do
nothing
to
attract
the
magnate
attention
and
that
it
behooved
her
as
an
american
wife
and
a
modern
woman
to
let
parsons
know
his
qualifications
and
to
prepossess
him
in
wilbur
favor
by
her
own
attractions
the
idea
appealed
to
her
exceedingly
she
had
been
hoping
that
some
opportunity
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
furtherance
of
wilbur
career
would
present
itself
for
she
felt
instinctively
that
with
her
he
would
make
more
rapid
progress
here
was
exactly
the
occasion
longed
for
she
saw
in
her
mind
eye
completed
mansion
stately
and
beautiful
the
admired
precursor
of
a
host
of
important
edifices
a
revolutionizing
monument
in
contemporary
architecture
wilbur
would
become
the
fashion
and
his
professional
success
be
assured
thanks
to
the
prompt
ability
of
his
wife
to
take
advantage
of
circumstances
so
she
would
prove
herself
a
veritable
helpmate
and
the
bond
of
marital
sympathy
would
be
strengthened
and
refreshed
to
begin
with
selma
hinted
to
williams
that
parsons
might
do
worse
than
employ
wilbur
to
design
his
house
flossy
accepted
the
suggestion
with
enthusiasm
and
promised
her
support
adding
that
parsons
was
a
person
of
sudden
and
strong
fancies
and
that
if
he
were
to
take
a
fancy
to
wilbur
the
desired
result
would
be
apt
to
follow
selma
quickly
decided
that
parsons
must
be
made
to
like
her
for
she
feared
lest
wilbur
quiet
undemonstrative
manner
would
fail
to
attract
him
evidently
he
admired
the
and
manly
assertion
of
gregory
williams
and
would
be
liable
to
regard
wilbur
as
lacking
in
force
and
enterprise
the
reflection
that
she
would
thus
be
working
as
necessarily
she
would
for
the
eternal
progress
of
truth
added
a
pleasant
savor
to
the
undertaking
for
it
was
clear
that
her
husband
was
an
ideal
architect
for
the
purpose
and
she
would
be
doing
a
true
service
to
parsons
in
convincing
him
that
this
was
so
altogether
her
soul
was
in
an
agreeable
flutter
notwithstanding
that
her
neighbor
flossy
had
recently
received
invitations
to
two
or
three
large
balls
and
been
referred
to
in
the
society
columns
of
the
newspapers
as
the
fascinating
and
clever
wife
of
the
rising
banker
gregory
williams
the
littletons
were
promptly
given
by
flossy
the
opportunity
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
parsons
family
parsons
was
a
ponderous
man
of
over
sixty
with
a
solid
rotund
grave
face
and
a
chin
whisker
he
was
absorbed
in
financial
interests
though
he
had
retired
from
active
business
and
had
come
to
new
york
to
live
chiefly
to
please
his
wife
and
daughter
parsons
who
was
somewhat
her
husband
junior
was
a
devotee
or
more
correctly
a
debauchee
of
hotel
life
since
the
time
when
they
had
become
exceedingly
rich
about
ten
years
before
they
had
made
a
grand
tour
of
the
hotels
of
this
country
and
europe
by
so
doing
parsons
and
her
daughter
felt
that
they
became
a
part
of
the
social
life
of
the
cities
which
they
visited
although
they
had
been
used
to
plain
if
not
slovenly
before
the
money
came
both
the
wife
and
daughter
had
evolved
into
connoisseurs
of
modish
and
luxurious
hotel
apparatus
and
garniture
they
had
learned
to
revel
in
many
courses
radiantly
upholstered
parlors
and
a
close
acquaintance
with
the
hotel
register
society
for
them
wherever
they
went
meant
finding
out
the
names
of
the
other
guests
and
dressing
for
them
being
on
easy
terms
with
the
head
waiter
and
elevator
boy
visiting
the
theatres
and
keeping
up
a
round
of
shopping
in
pursuit
of
articles
of
apparel
they
wore
rich
garments
and
considerable
jewelry
and
plastered
themselves
especially
the
daughter
with
bunches
of
violets
or
roses
parsons
was
partial
to
perfume
and
they
both
were
addicted
to
the
free
consumption
of
assorted
bonbons
to
be
sure
they
had
made
some
acquaintances
in
the
course
of
their
peregrinations
but
one
reason
for
moving
to
new
york
was
that
parsons
had
come
to
the
melancholy
conclusion
that
neither
the
princes
of
europe
nor
the
sons
of
american
leading
citizens
were
paying
that
attention
to
her
daughter
which
the
young
lady
charms
seemed
to
her
to
merit
if
living
lavishly
in
hotels
and
seeing
everybody
right
and
left
were
not
the
to
elegant
existence
and
hence
to
a
brilliant
match
for
lucretia
parsons
was
ready
to
try
the
effect
of
a
house
on
fifth
avenue
though
she
preferred
the
comforts
of
her
present
mode
of
life
still
one
advantage
of
a
stable
home
would
be
that
parsons
could
be
constantly
with
them
instead
of
an
occasional
and
intermittent
visitor
communicated
with
more
frequently
by
electricity
than
by
word
of
mouth
while
parsons
was
selecting
the
land
she
and
lucretia
had
abandoned
themselves
to
an
orgy
of
shopping
and
with
an
eye
to
the
new
house
their
rooms
at
the
hotel
were
already
littered
with
gorgeous
fabrics
patterns
of
and
pieces
of
pottery
selma
facility
in
the
new
york
manner
was
practised
on
silas
parsons
with
flattering
success
he
was
captivated
by
her
more
so
than
by
flossy
who
amused
him
as
a
flibbertigibbet
but
who
seemed
to
him
to
lack
the
serious
cast
of
character
which
he
felt
that
he
discerned
beneath
the
sprightliness
of
this
new
charmer
parsons
was
what
he
called
a
stickler
for
the
dignity
of
a
serious
demeanor
he
liked
to
laugh
at
the
theatre
but
mistrusted
a
daily
point
of
view
which
savored
of
buffoonery
he
was
fond
of
saying
that
more
than
one
public
man
in
the
united
states
had
come
to
grief
politically
from
being
a
joker
and
that
the
american
people
could
not
endure
flippancy
in
their
representatives
he
liked
to
tell
and
listen
to
humorous
stories
in
the
security
of
a
but
in
his
opinion
it
behooved
a
citizen
to
maintain
a
dignified
bearing
before
the
world
like
other
men
who
had
come
to
new
york
like
selma
herself
he
had
shrunk
from
and
deplored
at
first
the
lighter
tone
of
casual
speech
still
he
had
grown
used
to
it
and
had
even
come
to
depend
on
it
as
an
amusement
but
he
felt
that
in
the
case
of
selma
there
was
a
basis
of
ethical
earnestness
appropriate
to
woman
beneath
her
chatty
flow
of
small
talk
that
she
was
comparatively
a
accounted
partially
for
this
impression
but
it
was
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
she
still
reverted
after
her
sallies
of
pleasantry
to
a
grave
method
of
deportment
selma
chief
hospitality
toward
the
parsonses
took
the
form
of
a
theatre
party
which
included
a
supper
at
delmonico
after
the
play
it
was
an
expensive
kind
of
entertainment
which
she
felt
obliged
to
justify
to
wilbur
by
the
assertion
that
the
williamses
had
been
so
civil
she
considered
it
would
be
only
decent
to
show
attention
to
their
friends
she
was
unwilling
to
disclose
her
secret
lest
the
knowledge
of
it
might
make
wilbur
offish
and
so
embarrass
her
efforts
there
were
eight
in
the
party
and
the
affair
seemed
to
selma
to
go
off
admirably
she
was
enthralled
by
the
idea
of
using
her
own
personal
magnetism
to
promote
her
husband
business
she
felt
that
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
like
and
was
fitted
for
and
that
here
was
an
opportunity
for
her
individuality
to
display
itself
she
devoted
herself
with
engaging
assiduity
to
parsons
pleased
during
the
active
process
of
propitiation
by
the
that
her
table
was
one
of
the
centres
of
interest
in
the
large
restaurant
she
had
dressed
herself
with
formal
care
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
compliment
could
have
gratified
her
more
than
the
remark
which
parsons
made
as
he
regarded
her
appreciatively
when
he
had
finished
his
supper
that
she
suggested
his
idea
of
columbia
selma
glowed
with
satisfaction
the
comparison
struck
her
as
apt
and
appropriate
and
she
replied
with
a
proud
erection
of
her
head
which
imparted
to
her
features
their
transcendental
look
and
caused
her
short
curl
to
joggle
tremulously
i
suppose
i
see
what
you
mean
mr
parsons
chapter
vii
one
evening
four
or
five
days
after
this
supper
party
wilbur
laid
down
the
book
which
he
was
pretending
to
read
and
said
selma
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
must
give
up
dabbling
in
stocks
i
am
being
injured
by
it
not
financially
for
as
you
know
i
have
made
a
few
thousand
dollars
but
morally
i
thought
you
were
convinced
that
it
was
not
immoral
answered
selma
in
a
constrained
voice
i
do
not
refer
to
whether
speculation
is
justifiable
in
itself
but
to
its
effect
on
me
as
an
individual
its
distraction
to
my
mind
and
consequent
interference
with
my
professional
work
oh
for
a
year
now
the
greater
portion
of
the
time
i
have
had
some
interest
in
the
market
and
as
a
consequence
have
felt
impelled
to
look
in
on
williams
and
vanhorne
every
day
sometimes
oftener
i
am
unable
to
dismiss
my
speculations
from
my
thoughts
i
find
myself
wondering
what
has
happened
to
the
stocks
i
am
carrying
and
i
am
satisfied
that
the
practice
is
thoroughly
demoralizing
to
my
and
to
my
progress
i
am
going
to
give
it
up
i
suppose
you
must
give
it
up
if
it
affects
you
like
that
responded
selma
drily
i
do
see
exactly
why
it
should
it
may
seem
foolish
to
you
but
i
am
unable
to
put
my
ventures
out
of
my
mind
the
consequences
of
loss
would
be
so
serious
to
me
that
i
suppose
my
imagination
becomes
unduly
active
and
apprehensive
also
i
find
myself
eager
to
secure
large
gains
i
must
renounce
aladdin
lamp
from
this
day
forth
my
dear
and
trust
to
my
legitimate
business
for
my
income
selma
folded
her
hands
and
looked
grave
it
disappointing
that
you
feel
so
just
when
we
are
beginning
to
get
on
wilbur
i
have
realized
selma
that
you
have
enjoyed
and
er
been
made
happier
by
the
freedom
to
spend
which
this
extra
money
has
afforded
you
but
i
know
when
you
reflect
you
will
understand
that
i
am
right
and
that
it
would
be
disastrous
to
both
of
us
if
i
were
to
continue
to
do
what
i
believe
demoralizing
it
is
a
mortification
to
me
to
ask
you
to
retrench
but
i
said
to
myself
that
selma
would
be
the
first
to
insist
on
our
doing
so
if
she
knew
my
feelings
and
it
makes
me
happy
to
be
sure
of
your
approval
littleton
spoke
with
a
tender
plaintiveness
which
betrayed
that
in
his
secret
soul
he
was
less
confident
on
this
score
than
his
words
declared
or
than
he
himself
supposed
of
course
he
added
earnestly
i
shall
hope
that
it
will
not
make
much
difference
my
business
is
slowly
but
steadily
improving
and
i
am
doing
more
this
year
than
last
i
am
bending
all
my
energies
on
my
plans
for
wetmore
college
if
i
win
in
that
competition
i
shall
make
a
reputation
and
a
respectable
commission
you
have
been
on
those
plans
three
months
yes
and
shall
not
finish
them
for
another
two
i
wish
to
do
my
best
work
and
i
shall
be
glad
not
to
hear
quotations
of
the
ticker
in
my
brain
you
desire
me
to
be
thorough
surely
selma
oh
yes
only
you
know
people
very
often
spoil
things
by
pottering
over
them
i
never
potter
i
reject
because
i
am
dissatisfied
rather
than
offer
a
design
which
does
not
please
me
but
i
do
not
waste
my
time
call
it
then
i
wish
you
to
do
your
best
work
of
course
but
one
ca
expect
to
do
best
work
invariably
everything
was
going
so
nicely
that
you
must
perceive
it
will
be
inconvenient
to
have
to
economize
as
we
did
before
littleton
looked
at
his
wife
with
a
glance
of
loving
distress
you
would
really
care
a
button
i
know
you
would
selma
he
said
stoutly
of
course
not
if
it
were
necessary
she
answered
only
i
do
wish
to
do
so
unless
it
is
necessary
i
am
not
controverting
your
decision
about
the
stocks
though
i
think
your
imagination
as
you
say
is
to
blame
i
would
rather
cut
my
right
hand
off
than
persuade
you
to
act
contrary
to
your
conscience
but
it
inconvenient
wilbur
you
must
admit
to
give
up
the
things
we
have
become
accustomed
to
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
the
horse
i
am
certain
of
that
i
wish
you
to
see
my
side
of
it
say
that
you
do
she
said
with
shrill
intensity
it
is
because
i
do
see
it
that
i
am
troubled
selma
for
myself
i
am
no
happier
now
than
i
was
when
we
lived
more
simply
i
ca
believe
that
you
will
really
find
it
a
hardship
to
deny
yourself
such
extravagances
as
our
theatre
party
last
week
being
a
man
he
added
after
a
pause
i
suppose
i
may
not
appreciate
how
important
and
seductive
some
of
these
social
observances
appear
to
a
woman
and
heaven
knows
my
chief
wish
in
life
is
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
you
happy
you
must
be
aware
of
that
dearest
i
delight
to
work
hard
for
your
sake
but
it
seems
almost
ludicrous
to
be
talking
of
social
interests
to
you
of
all
women
why
at
the
time
we
were
married
i
feared
that
you
would
cut
yourself
off
from
reasonable
pleasures
on
account
of
your
dislike
of
everything
frivolous
i
remember
i
encouraged
you
not
to
take
too
ascetic
a
view
of
such
things
so
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
your
side
is
my
side
that
we
both
will
find
true
happiness
in
not
attempting
to
compete
with
people
whose
tastes
are
not
our
tastes
and
whose
aims
are
not
our
aims
then
you
think
i
have
deteriorated
she
said
with
a
superior
smile
i
think
of
you
as
the
most
conscientious
woman
i
ever
met
it
was
only
natural
that
you
should
be
spurred
by
our
neighbors
the
williamses
to
make
a
better
showing
socially
before
the
world
i
have
been
glad
to
see
you
emulous
up
to
a
certain
point
you
must
realize
though
that
we
can
not
keep
pace
with
them
even
if
we
so
desire
already
they
are
in
the
public
eye
he
appears
to
have
made
considerable
money
and
his
views
on
the
are
given
prominence
by
the
press
he
and
his
wife
are
beginning
to
be
recognized
by
people
who
were
ignorant
of
their
existence
four
years
ago
you
told
me
last
week
that
williams
had
attended
one
of
the
fashionable
balls
and
i
saw
in
newspaper
a
description
of
her
toilette
at
another
it
begins
to
look
as
if
in
a
few
years
more
their
ambition
might
be
realized
and
the
doors
of
the
morton
price
mansion
open
wide
to
admit
this
clever
country
cousin
to
the
earthly
paradise
it
must
be
evident
to
you
selma
that
very
shortly
we
shall
see
only
the
dust
of
their
in
the
dim
social
distance
williams
told
me
that
he
has
bought
a
house
near
the
park
he
has
bought
a
new
house
they
are
going
to
move
exclaimed
selma
sitting
up
straight
and
with
a
fierce
light
in
her
eyes
yes
he
was
going
home
to
tell
his
wife
it
seems
that
they
have
been
talking
vaguely
of
moving
for
some
time
an
acquaintance
happened
to
offer
him
a
house
and
williams
closed
the
bargain
on
the
spot
in
his
customary
style
i
shall
be
sorry
to
have
them
go
on
some
accounts
for
they
have
always
been
friendly
and
you
seem
fond
of
the
wife
but
we
shall
find
it
easier
perhaps
when
they
are
gone
to
live
according
to
our
own
ideas
flossy
has
not
been
quite
so
nice
lately
said
selma
i
am
afraid
she
is
disposed
to
put
on
airs
her
head
may
have
been
turned
by
her
success
she
has
a
kind
heart
but
a
giddy
brain
in
spite
of
its
cleverness
flossy
has
been
getting
on
of
course
but
so
are
we
getting
on
why
should
they
be
recognized
as
you
call
it
any
more
than
we
in
time
i
mean
not
in
the
same
way
perhaps
since
you
do
approve
of
the
sort
of
things
since
i
do
approve
why
selma
surely
since
do
approve
then
i
only
mean
that
gregory
williams
has
shown
initiative
has
pushed
ahead
and
is
er
the
talk
of
the
town
i
expect
you
to
be
successful
too
is
there
any
reason
on
earth
why
the
door
of
the
morton
prices
should
open
wide
to
her
and
not
to
me
i
suppose
not
if
if
you
wish
it
she
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
gazed
at
him
a
moment
with
an
imperious
frown
then
suddenly
with
the
litheness
of
a
cat
she
slipped
from
her
chair
to
the
floor
at
his
feet
and
leaning
against
his
knee
looked
up
into
his
face
you
dear
boy
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
you
said
to
me
once
that
if
ever
the
time
came
when
i
thought
you
visionary
i
was
to
let
you
know
of
course
i
understand
you
are
worth
a
thousand
but
do
you
think
you
would
get
on
faster
if
you
were
a
little
more
aggressive
in
your
work
if
you
were
so
afraid
of
being
superficial
or
sensational
you
were
intimating
a
few
minutes
ago
she
added
speaking
rapidly
under
the
stress
of
the
message
she
burned
to
deliver
that
i
seemed
changed
i
do
believe
i
am
changed
but
if
i
seem
different
it
is
because
i
feel
so
strongly
that
those
who
wish
to
succeed
must
assert
themselves
and
seize
opportunities
there
is
where
it
seems
to
me
that
williams
has
the
advantage
over
you
wilbur
one
of
the
finest
and
most
significant
qualities
of
our
people
you
know
is
their
enterprise
and
aggressiveness
architecture
is
like
the
stock
business
but
the
same
theory
of
progress
must
be
applicable
to
both
do
you
think
i
may
be
right
wilbur
do
you
see
what
i
mean
he
stroked
her
hair
and
answered
gently
what
is
it
that
i
am
not
doing
which
you
think
i
might
do
selma
snuggled
close
to
him
and
put
her
hand
in
his
she
was
vibrating
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
the
duty
vouchsafed
to
her
to
guide
and
assist
the
man
she
loved
it
was
a
blissful
and
a
precious
moment
to
her
if
i
were
you
she
said
solemnly
i
should
build
something
striking
and
original
something
which
would
make
everyone
who
beheld
it
ask
is
the
architect
name
i
would
strike
out
boldly
without
caring
too
much
what
the
critics
and
the
people
of
europe
would
say
you
mus
be
too
afraid
wilbur
of
producing
something
american
and
you
must
be
too
afraid
of
the
american
ways
of
doing
things
we
work
more
quickly
here
in
everything
and
and
i
still
ca
help
feeling
that
you
potter
a
little
necessarily
i
do
know
about
the
details
of
your
business
but
if
i
were
you
instead
of
designing
small
buildings
or
competing
for
colleges
and
churches
where
more
than
half
the
time
someone
else
gets
the
award
i
should
make
friends
with
the
people
who
live
in
those
fine
houses
on
fifth
avenue
and
get
an
order
to
design
a
splendid
residence
for
one
of
them
if
you
were
to
make
a
grand
success
of
that
as
you
surely
would
your
reputation
would
be
made
you
ask
me
why
i
like
to
entertain
and
am
willing
to
know
people
like
that
it
is
to
help
you
to
get
clients
and
to
come
to
the
front
professionally
now
is
that
sensible
and
practical
and
right
too
her
voice
rang
triumphantly
with
the
righteousness
of
her
plea
selma
dear
if
i
am
not
enough
i
am
glad
to
listen
to
your
suggestions
but
art
is
not
to
be
hurried
i
can
not
vulgarize
my
art
i
could
not
consent
to
that
of
course
not
wilbur
not
enough
is
just
the
phrase
i
think
you
are
so
absorbed
in
the
theory
of
fine
things
that
i
am
sure
you
often
let
the
practical
opportunities
to
get
the
fine
things
to
do
slip
perhaps
dear
i
will
try
to
guard
against
it
wilbur
took
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
down
tenderly
into
her
face
his
own
was
a
little
weary
above
everything
else
in
life
i
wish
to
make
you
happy
he
said
i
am
happy
you
dear
boy
truly
yes
truly
and
if
something
happens
which
i
am
nearly
sure
will
happen
i
shall
be
happier
still
it
a
secret
and
i
must
tell
you
but
if
it
does
happen
you
ca
help
agreeing
that
your
wife
has
been
clever
and
has
helped
you
in
your
profession
helped
me
ah
selma
he
said
folding
her
in
his
arms
i
do
think
you
realize
how
much
you
are
to
me
in
this
modern
world
what
with
and
shyness
and
contemporary
distaste
for
fulsome
expression
it
is
difficult
to
tell
adequately
those
we
love
how
we
feel
toward
them
you
are
my
darling
and
my
inspiration
the
sun
rises
and
sets
with
you
and
unless
you
were
happy
i
could
never
be
each
man
in
this
puzzling
world
must
live
according
to
his
own
lights
and
i
according
to
mine
am
trying
to
make
the
most
of
myself
consistent
with
and
avoidance
of
the
low
human
aims
and
methods
upon
which
our
new
civilization
is
supposed
to
frown
if
i
am
neglecting
my
lawful
opportunities
if
i
am
failing
to
see
wisely
and
correctly
i
shall
be
grateful
for
counsel
ah
selma
for
your
sake
even
more
than
for
my
own
i
grieve
that
we
have
no
children
a
hands
would
i
fancy
be
the
best
of
counsellors
and
enlighteners
if
children
had
come
at
first
it
would
have
been
very
nice
but
now
now
i
think
they
might
stand
in
the
way
of
my
being
of
help
to
you
and
i
am
so
anxious
to
help
you
wilbur
as
a
result
of
this
conversation
littleton
devoted
himself
more
assiduously
than
ever
to
his
work
he
was
eager
to
increase
his
earnings
so
that
his
income
should
not
be
curtailed
by
his
decision
to
avoid
further
ventures
in
the
he
was
troubled
in
soul
for
selma
accusation
that
he
was
visionary
haunted
him
could
it
be
that
he
was
too
scrupulous
too
uncompromising
and
lacked
proper
enterprise
failed
to
convince
him
that
this
was
so
yet
left
a
lurking
doubt
which
was
harassing
his
clear
mind
was
too
modest
to
believe
in
its
own
infallibility
for
he
was
psychologist
enough
to
understand
that
no
one
can
be
absolutely
sure
that
his
perspective
of
life
is
accurate
possibly
he
was
sacrificing
his
wife
legitimate
aspirations
to
too
rigid
canons
of
behavior
and
to
an
unconscious
lack
of
initiative
on
the
other
hand
as
a
positive
character
he
believed
that
he
saw
clearly
and
he
could
not
avoid
the
reflection
that
if
this
was
the
case
he
and
selma
were
drifting
apart
the
more
bitter
alternative
of
the
two
and
a
condition
which
if
perpetuated
would
involve
the
destruction
of
the
scheme
of
matrimonial
happiness
the
ideal
communion
of
two
sympathetic
souls
in
which
he
was
living
as
a
proud
partner
apparently
he
was
in
one
of
two
predicaments
either
he
was
self
deceived
which
was
abhorrent
to
him
as
a
thoughtful
grappler
with
the
eternal
mysteries
or
he
had
misinterpreted
the
character
of
the
woman
whose
transcendent
quality
was
a
dearer
faith
to
him
than
the
integrity
of
his
own
manhood
so
it
was
with
a
troubled
heart
that
he
applied
himself
to
more
rigorous
professional
endeavor
like
most
architects
he
had
pursued
certain
lines
of
work
because
orders
had
come
to
him
and
the
chances
of
employment
had
ordained
that
his
services
should
be
sought
for
small
churches
and
kindred
buildings
in
the
surrounding
country
rather
than
for
more
elaborate
and
costly
structures
on
these
undertakings
it
was
his
habit
to
expend
abundant
thought
and
devotion
the
class
of
work
was
to
his
taste
for
though
the
funds
at
his
disposal
were
not
always
so
large
as
he
desired
for
artistic
effects
yet
he
enjoyed
the
opportunity
of
showing
that
simplicity
need
not
be
homely
and
disenchanting
but
could
wear
the
aspect
of
grace
and
poetry
latterly
he
had
been
requested
to
furnish
designs
for
some
blocks
of
houses
in
the
outlying
wards
of
the
city
where
the
owners
sought
to
provide
attractive
modern
flats
for
people
with
moderate
means
various
commissions
had
come
to
him
also
to
design
decorative
work
which
interested
him
and
gave
scope
to
his
refined
and
aspiring
imagination
and
he
was
enthusiastically
absorbed
in
preparing
his
competitive
plans
for
the
building
of
wetmore
college
his
time
was
already
well
occupied
by
the
matters
which
he
had
in
hand
that
is
he
had
enough
to
do
and
yet
did
not
feel
obliged
to
deny
himself
the
luxury
of
deliberate
thoroughness
in
connection
with
each
professional
undertaking
save
for
the
thought
that
he
must
needs
earn
more
in
order
to
please
selma
he
would
have
been
completely
happy
in
the
slow
but
flattering
growth
of
his
business
and
in
feeling
his
way
securely
toward
greater
success
now
however
he
began
to
ask
himself
if
it
were
not
possible
to
hasten
this
or
that
piece
of
work
in
order
to
afford
himself
the
necessary
leisure
for
new
employment
he
began
also
to
consider
whether
he
might
not
be
able
without
loss
of
dignity
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
securing
more
important
clients
to
solicit
business
was
not
to
be
thought
of
but
now
and
again
he
put
the
question
to
himself
whether
he
had
not
been
too
indifferent
as
to
who
was
who
and
what
was
what
in
the
development
of
his
business
while
littleton
was
thus
mulling
over
existing
conditions
and
subjecting
his
conduct
to
the
relentless
lens
of
his
own
conscience
and
theories
selma
announced
to
him
jubilantly
about
a
fortnight
subsequent
to
their
conversation
that
her
secret
was
a
secret
no
longer
and
that
parsons
desired
to
employ
him
to
build
an
imposing
private
residence
on
fifth
avenue
near
the
park
parsons
confirmed
this
intelligence
on
the
following
day
in
a
personal
interview
he
informed
littleton
that
he
was
going
to
build
in
order
to
please
his
wife
and
daughter
and
intimated
that
expense
need
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
gratification
of
their
wishes
after
the
business
matters
were
disposed
of
he
was
obviously
ready
to
intrust
all
the
artistic
details
to
his
architect
consequently
littleton
enjoyed
an
agreeable
quarter
of
an
hour
of
exaltation
he
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
building
a
house
of
this
description
and
the
hope
of
being
able
to
give
free
scope
to
his
architectural
bent
without
molestation
made
that
prospect
roseate
he
could
desire
no
better
opportunity
for
expressing
his
ideas
and
proving
his
capacity
it
was
an
ideal
chance
and
his
soul
thrilled
as
he
called
up
the
shadowy
fabric
of
scheme
after
scheme
to
fill
the
trial
canvas
of
his
fantasy
nor
did
he
fail
to
award
due
credit
to
selma
for
her
share
in
the
transaction
not
to
the
extent
perhaps
of
confessing
incapacity
on
his
own
part
but
by
testifying
lovingly
to
her
cleverness
she
was
in
too
good
humor
at
her
success
to
insist
on
his
humiliation
in
set
terms
the
two
points
in
which
she
was
most
vitally
interested
the
advantage
of
her
own
interference
and
the
consequent
prompt
extension
of
her
husband
field
of
usefulness
had
been
triumphantly
proved
and
there
was
no
need
that
the
third
wilbur
lack
of
capacity
to
battle
and
discriminate
for
himself
should
be
emphasized
selma
knew
what
she
thought
in
her
own
mind
and
she
entertained
the
hope
that
this
lesson
might
be
a
lamp
to
his
feet
for
future
illumination
she
was
even
generous
enough
to
exclaim
placing
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looking
into
his
face
with
complacent
fervor
you
might
have
accomplished
it
just
as
well
yourself
wilbur
littleton
shook
his
head
and
smiled
it
was
a
case
of
witchery
and
fascination
he
probably
divined
how
eager
you
were
to
help
me
and
he
was
glad
to
yield
to
the
agreeable
spell
of
your
wifely
devotion
oh
no
said
selma
i
am
sure
he
never
guessed
for
one
moment
of
what
i
was
thinking
of
course
i
did
try
to
make
him
like
me
but
that
was
only
sensible
to
make
people
like
one
is
the
way
to
get
business
i
believe
littleton
quarter
of
an
hour
of
exaltation
was
rudely
checked
by
a
note
from
parsons
requesting
an
interview
in
regard
to
the
plans
when
he
presented
himself
he
found
her
and
her
daughter
imbued
with
definite
ideas
on
the
subject
of
architects
and
architecture
in
the
eyes
of
parsons
the
architect
of
her
projected
house
was
nothing
but
a
young
man
in
the
employ
of
her
husband
who
was
to
guide
them
as
to
measurements
carpentry
and
plumbing
but
was
otherwise
to
do
her
bidding
for
a
pecuniary
consideration
on
the
same
general
basis
as
the
waiter
at
the
hotel
or
the
theatre
as
to
architecture
she
expected
him
to
draw
plans
just
as
she
expected
dealers
in
carpets
or
to
show
her
patterns
in
easy
succession
i
do
care
for
that
take
it
away
that
is
rather
pretty
but
let
me
see
something
else
what
she
said
to
littleton
was
we
have
quite
decided
yet
what
we
want
but
if
you
bring
some
plans
the
next
time
you
call
we
let
you
know
which
we
like
best
there
a
house
in
vienna
i
saw
once
which
i
said
at
the
time
to
lucretia
i
would
copy
if
i
ever
built
i
mislaid
the
photograph
of
it
but
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
when
i
see
your
drawings
how
it
differed
from
yours
lucretia
has
a
fancy
for
something
moorish
or
oriental
i
guess
parsons
would
prefer
plain
and
massive
but
he
has
left
it
all
to
us
and
both
daughter
and
i
think
we
rather
have
a
house
which
would
speak
for
itself
and
not
be
mixed
up
with
everybody
else
you
better
bring
us
half
a
dozen
to
choose
from
and
between
me
and
you
and
lucretia
we
arrive
at
something
elegant
and
unique
this
was
sadly
disillusionizing
to
littleton
and
the
second
experience
was
no
less
so
the
refined
outline
sketches
proffered
by
him
were
unenthusiastically
surveyed
and
languidly
discarded
like
so
many
it
was
evident
that
both
the
mother
and
daughter
were
disappointed
and
littleton
presently
divined
that
their
chief
objection
was
to
the
plainness
of
the
several
designs
this
was
made
unmistakably
obvious
when
parsons
after
exhibiting
a
number
of
photographs
of
foreign
public
buildings
with
which
she
had
armed
herself
surveyed
the
most
ornate
holding
it
out
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
exclaimed
impressively
this
is
more
the
sort
of
thing
we
should
like
i
think
parsons
has
already
explained
to
you
that
he
desired
our
house
to
be
as
handsome
as
possible
i
had
endeavored
to
bear
that
in
mind
littleton
retorted
with
spirit
i
believe
that
either
of
these
plans
would
give
you
a
house
which
would
be
handsome
interesting
and
in
good
taste
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
there
is
anything
unique
about
any
of
them
said
parsons
with
a
cold
sniff
intended
to
be
conclusive
nor
did
littleton
efforts
to
explain
that
elaboration
in
a
private
residence
was
liable
to
detract
from
architectural
dignity
and
to
produce
the
effect
of
vulgarity
fall
upon
receptive
soil
the
rich
wife
listened
in
stony
silence
at
times
raising
her
lorgnette
to
examine
as
a
curiosity
this
young
man
who
was
telling
her
an
american
woman
who
had
travelled
around
the
world
and
seen
everything
to
be
seen
how
she
ought
to
build
her
own
house
the
upshot
of
this
interview
was
that
littleton
was
sent
away
with
languid
instructions
to
try
again
he
departed
thinking
melancholy
thoughts
and
with
fire
in
his
soul
which
for
selma
sake
he
endeavored
to
keep
out
of
his
eyes
chapter
viii
the
departure
of
the
williamses
to
a
smarter
neighborhood
was
a
trial
for
selma
she
nursed
the
dispiriting
reflection
that
she
and
wilbur
might
just
as
well
be
moving
also
that
a
little
foresight
and
shrewdness
on
her
husband
part
would
have
enabled
him
to
sell
at
a
handsome
profit
the
house
in
which
they
were
living
and
that
there
was
no
reason
except
the
sheer
happy
faculty
of
making
the
most
of
opportunities
to
account
for
the
social
recognition
which
flossy
and
her
husband
were
beginning
to
receive
it
had
not
been
easy
to
bear
with
equanimity
during
the
last
year
the
ingenuous
warblings
in
which
flossy
had
indulged
as
an
outlet
to
her
triumphant
spirits
and
to
listen
to
naïve
recitals
of
new
progress
as
though
she
herself
were
a
companion
or
ladies
maid
to
whom
such
developments
could
never
happen
she
was
weary
of
being
merely
a
recipient
of
confidences
and
a
sympathetic
listener
and
more
weary
still
of
being
regarded
as
such
by
her
and
successful
neighbor
why
should
flossy
be
so
dense
why
should
she
play
second
fiddle
to
flossy
why
should
flossy
take
for
granted
that
she
did
not
intend
to
keep
pace
with
her
keep
pace
indeed
when
if
circumstances
would
only
shape
themselves
a
little
differently
she
would
be
able
speedily
to
outstrip
her
volatile
friend
in
the
struggle
for
social
preferment
not
unnaturally
their
friendship
had
been
somewhat
strained
by
the
simmering
of
these
thoughts
in
selma
bosom
if
a
recipient
of
confidences
becomes
tart
or
cold
ingenuous
prattle
is
apt
to
flow
less
spontaneously
though
flossy
was
completely
and
consequently
glad
to
pour
out
her
satisfaction
into
a
sympathetic
ear
she
began
to
realize
that
there
was
something
amiss
with
her
friend
which
mere
conscientious
disapproval
of
her
own
frivolities
did
not
adequately
explain
it
troubled
her
somewhat
for
she
liked
the
littletons
and
was
proud
of
her
acquaintance
with
them
however
she
was
conscious
of
having
acquitted
herself
toward
them
with
liberality
and
especially
now
that
her
social
vista
was
widening
she
was
not
disposed
at
first
to
analyze
too
deeply
the
cause
of
the
lack
of
sympathy
between
them
that
is
she
was
struck
by
selma
offish
manner
and
frigid
silences
but
forgot
them
until
they
were
forced
upon
her
attention
the
next
time
they
met
but
as
her
friend
continued
to
receive
her
bubbling
announcements
with
stiff
indifference
flossy
in
her
perplexity
began
to
bend
her
acute
mental
faculties
more
searchingly
on
her
idol
a
fixed
point
of
view
will
keep
a
shrine
sacred
forever
but
let
a
perspective
be
altered
and
it
is
astonishing
how
different
the
features
of
divinity
will
appear
flossy
had
worshipped
with
the
eyes
of
faith
now
that
her
adoration
was
rejected
without
apparent
cause
her
curiosity
was
piqued
and
she
sought
an
interpretation
of
the
mystery
from
her
clever
wits
as
she
observed
selma
more
dispassionately
her
suspicion
was
stirred
and
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
had
been
burning
incense
before
a
false
goddess
this
doubt
was
agitating
her
mind
at
the
time
when
they
moved
from
the
street
selma
was
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
this
doubt
as
she
had
been
largely
unconscious
of
her
own
sour
demeanor
she
had
no
wish
to
lose
the
advantages
of
intimate
association
with
the
williamses
on
the
contrary
she
expected
to
make
progress
on
her
own
account
by
admission
into
their
new
social
circle
she
went
promptly
to
call
and
saw
fit
to
show
herself
tactfully
appreciative
of
the
new
establishment
and
more
ready
to
listen
to
flossy
volubility
flossy
who
was
radiant
and
bubbling
over
with
fresh
experiences
which
she
was
eager
to
impart
was
glad
to
dismiss
her
doubt
and
to
give
herself
up
to
the
delights
of
unbridled
speech
she
took
selma
over
her
new
house
which
had
been
purchased
just
as
it
stood
completely
furnished
from
the
previous
owner
who
had
suffered
financial
reverses
gregory
bought
it
because
it
was
really
a
bargain
she
said
it
will
do
very
well
for
the
present
but
we
intend
to
build
before
long
i
am
keeping
my
eye
on
your
husband
and
am
expecting
great
things
from
the
parsons
house
do
you
know
i
believe
in
littleton
and
feel
sure
that
some
day
we
shall
wake
up
and
find
him
famous
this
was
amiable
particularly
as
flossy
was
very
busily
engaged
in
contemplating
the
brilliant
progress
of
gregory
williams
and
his
wife
but
selma
returned
home
feeling
sore
and
dissatisfied
flossy
had
been
gracious
but
still
dense
and
naïvely
condescending
selma
chose
to
foresee
that
her
friend
would
neglect
her
and
her
foresight
was
correct
the
call
was
not
returned
for
many
weeks
although
flossy
had
assured
her
when
they
separated
that
distance
would
make
no
difference
in
their
intimacy
but
in
the
first
place
her
doubts
recurred
to
flossy
after
the
departure
of
her
visitor
and
in
the
second
the
agitations
incident
to
her
new
surroundings
fortified
by
these
doubts
made
neglect
easy
when
she
did
call
selma
happened
to
be
out
a
few
days
later
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
williamses
arrived
selma
would
have
preferred
to
remain
at
home
as
a
rebuke
but
she
was
miserably
conscious
that
flossy
would
not
perceive
the
point
of
the
refusal
so
she
went
and
was
annoyed
when
she
realized
that
the
guests
were
only
people
whom
she
knew
already
the
parsonses
and
some
of
gregory
williams
former
associates
whom
she
had
met
at
the
old
house
it
was
a
pleasant
dinner
apparently
to
all
except
selma
the
entertainment
was
flatteringly
lavish
and
both
the
host
and
hostess
with
suavity
put
in
circulation
under
the
rose
the
sentiment
that
there
are
no
friends
like
old
friends
a
graceful
insincerity
which
most
of
them
present
accepted
as
true
indeed
in
one
sense
it
was
not
an
insincerity
for
gregory
and
his
wife
entertained
cordial
feelings
toward
them
all
but
on
the
other
hand
selma
immediate
and
bitter
conclusion
was
also
true
that
the
company
had
been
invited
together
for
the
reason
that
in
the
opinion
of
flossy
they
would
not
have
harmonized
well
with
anyone
else
said
wilbur
as
they
drove
away
from
the
house
barring
a
few
moments
of
agony
in
the
society
of
my
tormentor
parsons
i
had
a
pleasant
evening
they
were
obviously
potting
their
old
acquaintance
in
one
pie
but
to
my
thinking
it
was
preferable
to
being
sandwiched
in
between
some
of
their
new
friends
whom
we
do
not
know
and
who
know
nothing
of
us
it
was
a
little
evident
but
on
the
whole
agreeable
selma
shrouded
in
her
wraps
made
no
reply
at
first
suddenly
she
exclaimed
with
fierceness
i
consider
it
rank
impertinence
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
they
do
not
think
us
good
enough
to
meet
their
new
friends
littleton
who
still
found
difficulty
in
remembering
that
his
wife
would
not
always
enjoy
the
humor
of
an
equivocal
situation
was
sorry
that
he
had
spoken
come
selma
he
said
there
no
use
in
taking
that
view
of
the
matter
you
would
not
really
care
to
meet
the
other
people
yes
i
would
and
she
knows
it
i
shall
never
enter
her
house
again
as
to
that
my
dear
the
probabilities
are
that
we
shall
not
be
asked
for
some
time
you
know
perfectly
well
that
in
the
nature
of
things
your
intimacy
with
williams
must
languish
now
that
she
lives
at
a
distance
and
has
new
surroundings
she
may
continue
to
be
very
fond
of
you
but
you
ca
hope
to
see
very
much
of
her
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
in
her
character
she
is
a
shallow
little
worldling
said
selma
with
measured
intensity
but
you
knew
that
already
the
fact
that
she
invited
us
to
dinner
and
did
not
ignore
our
existence
altogether
shows
that
she
likes
us
and
wishes
to
continue
the
friendship
i
no
doubt
she
believes
that
she
is
going
to
see
a
great
deal
of
us
and
you
should
blame
destiny
and
the
force
of
fashionable
circumstances
not
flossy
if
you
drift
apart
she
invited
us
because
she
wished
to
show
off
her
new
house
not
altogether
you
mus
be
too
hard
on
her
selma
moved
her
shoulders
impatiently
and
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
broken
only
by
the
tapping
of
her
foot
then
she
asked
how
nearly
have
you
finished
the
plans
for
the
parsons
house
wilbur
brow
clouded
under
cover
of
the
night
he
hesitated
an
instant
before
replying
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
parsons
and
i
do
not
seem
to
get
on
very
well
together
her
ideas
and
mine
on
the
subject
of
architecture
are
wide
apart
as
i
have
intimated
to
you
once
or
twice
i
have
modified
my
plans
again
and
she
has
made
airy
suggestions
which
from
my
point
of
view
are
impossible
we
are
practically
at
loggerheads
and
i
am
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
what
i
ought
to
do
there
was
a
wealth
of
condensation
in
the
word
which
brought
back
unpleasantly
to
selma
pauline
use
of
the
same
word
in
connection
with
the
estimate
which
had
been
formed
of
miss
bailey
there
can
be
only
one
thing
to
do
in
the
end
she
said
if
you
agree
parsons
of
course
must
have
her
house
as
she
wishes
it
it
is
her
house
wilbur
it
is
her
house
and
she
has
that
right
certainly
the
question
is
whether
i
am
willing
to
allow
the
world
to
point
to
an
architectural
and
call
it
mine
is
this
another
case
of
neglecting
the
practical
side
wilbur
i
am
sure
you
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
changes
she
desires
if
i
were
building
a
house
i
should
expect
to
have
it
built
to
suit
me
and
i
should
be
annoyed
if
the
architect
stood
on
points
and
were
captious
selma
under
the
influence
of
this
more
congenial
theme
had
partially
recovered
her
equanimity
her
duty
was
her
pleasure
and
it
was
clearly
her
duty
to
lead
her
husband
in
the
right
path
and
save
him
from
becoming
the
victim
of
his
own
shortcomings
wilbur
sighed
i
have
told
her
he
said
that
i
would
submit
another
entirely
new
sketch
it
may
be
that
i
can
introduce
some
of
her
and
her
daughter
splurgy
and
garish
misconceptions
without
making
myself
hopelessly
ridiculous
he
entered
the
house
wearily
and
as
he
stood
before
the
hall
table
under
the
chandelier
selma
took
him
by
the
arm
and
turning
him
toward
her
gazed
into
his
face
i
wish
to
examine
you
pauline
said
to
me
that
she
thinks
you
are
looking
pale
i
do
see
that
you
are
no
more
so
than
usual
you
never
were
rosy
exactly
do
you
know
i
have
an
idea
that
she
thinks
i
am
working
you
to
death
pauline
what
reason
has
she
to
think
anything
of
the
kind
besides
i
am
perfectly
well
it
is
a
delight
to
work
for
a
woman
like
you
dearest
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
tenderly
yet
gravely
too
as
though
the
riddle
of
life
did
not
solve
itself
at
the
touch
of
her
lips
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
he
added
that
i
shall
finish
and
send
off
the
wetmore
college
plans
this
week
i
am
glad
they
are
off
your
hands
for
you
will
have
more
time
for
other
work
yes
i
think
i
may
have
done
something
worth
while
he
said
wistfully
and
i
shall
try
not
to
be
annoyed
if
someone
else
gets
the
award
she
responded
smoothing
down
the
sheen
of
her
evening
dress
and
regarding
herself
in
the
mirror
of
course
someone
else
may
have
taken
equal
pains
and
done
a
better
thing
it
is
necessary
always
to
be
prepared
for
that
that
is
the
trouble
that
is
why
i
disapprove
of
competitions
selma
you
are
talking
nonsense
littleton
exclaimed
with
sudden
sternness
the
decision
in
his
tone
made
her
start
the
color
mounted
to
her
face
and
she
surveyed
him
for
an
instant
haughtily
as
though
he
had
done
her
an
injury
then
with
an
oratorical
air
and
her
archangel
look
she
said
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
wilbur
that
i
am
trying
to
save
you
from
yourself
littleton
was
ever
susceptible
to
that
look
of
hers
it
suggested
incarnate
conscientiousness
and
seemed
incompatible
with
human
imperfection
or
unworthy
ambitions
he
was
too
wroth
to
relent
altogether
but
he
compressed
his
lips
and
returned
her
look
searchingly
as
though
he
would
scrutinize
her
soul
i
bound
to
believe
i
do
believe
that
you
are
trying
to
help
me
selma
i
need
your
advice
and
help
even
against
myself
i
dare
say
but
there
are
some
matters
of
which
you
can
not
judge
so
well
as
i
you
must
trust
my
opinion
where
the
development
of
my
professional
life
is
concerned
i
shall
not
forget
your
caution
to
be
practical
but
for
the
sake
of
expediency
i
can
not
be
false
to
what
i
believe
true
come
dear
let
us
go
to
bed
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
to
lead
her
upstairs
but
she
turned
from
it
to
collect
her
fan
and
gloves
looking
not
at
him
but
at
herself
in
the
mirror
she
answered
of
course
i
trust
though
that
this
does
not
mean
you
intend
to
act
foolishly
in
regard
to
the
parsons
house
i
have
already
told
you
he
said
looking
back
that
i
am
going
to
make
another
attempt
to
satisfy
that
exasperating
woman
and
her
daughter
and
you
can
satisfy
them
i
sure
if
you
only
choose
to
said
selma
by
way
of
a
firm
final
observation
littleton
prophecy
in
regard
to
the
waning
of
friendship
between
his
wife
and
williams
proved
to
be
correct
propinquity
had
made
them
intimate
and
separation
by
force
of
circumstances
put
a
summary
end
to
frequent
and
cordial
intercourse
between
them
as
he
had
predicted
their
first
invitation
to
the
new
house
was
still
the
last
at
the
end
of
three
months
and
save
for
a
few
words
on
one
occasion
in
the
street
selma
and
flossy
did
not
meet
during
that
period
but
during
that
same
three
months
selma
attention
was
constantly
attracted
to
the
williamses
by
prominent
newspaper
allusions
to
their
prosperity
and
growing
fashionable
prestige
what
they
did
and
where
they
went
were
chronicled
in
the
then
new
style
journalistic
social
gossip
and
the
world
was
made
familiar
with
his
financial
opinions
and
his
equipages
and
her
toilettes
the
meeting
in
the
street
was
an
ordeal
for
selma
flossy
had
been
shopping
and
was
about
to
step
into
her
carriage
the
door
of
which
was
held
open
by
an
imposing
liveried
footman
when
the
two
women
nearly
collided
i
have
not
seen
you
for
an
age
flossy
exclaimed
with
the
genuine
ring
of
regret
in
her
tone
with
which
busy
people
partially
atone
for
having
left
undone
the
things
they
ought
or
would
like
to
have
done
which
way
are
you
going
ca
i
take
you
somewhere
selma
glanced
sternly
at
the
snug
coupe
and
stylish
horses
no
we
do
seem
to
meet
very
often
she
said
drily
i
living
though
at
the
same
place
she
added
with
a
determination
to
be
sprightly
yes
i
know
i
owe
you
a
call
it
dreadful
of
me
i
been
intending
to
come
but
you
ca
imagine
how
busy
i
been
such
a
number
of
invitations
and
new
things
to
be
done
i
looking
forward
to
giving
you
a
full
account
of
my
experiences
i
read
about
them
in
the
newspapers
oh
yes
gregory
is
always
civil
to
reporters
he
says
that
the
newspapers
are
one
of
the
great
institutions
of
the
country
and
that
it
is
sensible
to
keep
in
touch
with
them
i
will
confide
to
you
that
i
think
the
whole
business
vulgar
and
i
intend
some
day
when
we
are
firmly
established
to
be
ugly
to
them
but
at
present
the
publicity
is
rather
convenient
and
amusing
she
exclaimed
with
a
gay
shake
of
her
head
which
set
her
ringlets
bobbing
i
should
think
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
have
the
details
of
appearance
described
by
the
press
flossy
doubts
had
returned
in
full
force
during
the
conversation
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
if
that
is
true
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
the
very
thing
she
would
like
but
she
answered
blithely
oh
one
gets
used
to
it
then
i
ca
take
you
anywhere
i
sorry
some
day
i
hope
my
round
of
gayety
will
cease
so
that
we
can
have
a
quiet
evening
together
i
miss
your
husband
i
always
find
him
suggestive
and
interesting
round
of
gayety
a
quiet
evening
together
murmured
selma
as
she
walked
away
wilbur
is
right
frivolous
little
thing
she
is
determined
to
destroy
our
friendship
four
weeks
subsequent
to
this
meeting
the
newspapers
contained
a
fulsome
account
of
a
dancing
party
given
by
and
gregory
williams
an
elegant
and
recherché
entertainment
in
the
language
of
the
reporter
a
list
of
the
company
followed
which
selma
scrutinized
with
a
brow
like
a
she
had
acquired
a
feverish
habit
of
perusing
similar
lists
and
she
recognized
that
flossy
guests
among
the
first
of
whom
were
and
morton
price
and
the
misses
price
were
chiefly
confined
to
persons
whom
she
had
learned
to
know
as
members
of
fashionable
society
she
read
in
the
further
phraseology
of
the
reporter
that
it
was
a
small
and
select
affair
at
the
end
of
the
list
as
though
they
had
been
invited
on
sufferance
as
a
business
necessity
were
the
parsonses
but
these
were
the
only
former
associates
of
the
williamses
selma
had
just
finished
her
second
reading
of
this
news
item
when
her
meditation
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
her
husband
who
had
been
silent
during
dinner
as
though
he
had
some
matter
on
his
mind
and
was
at
the
moment
sitting
close
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
lamp
which
lighted
the
library
table
i
fear
you
will
be
disappointed
selma
but
i
have
informed
parsons
definitely
this
morning
that
he
must
get
another
architect
the
ideas
of
his
wife
and
daughter
are
hopelessly
at
variance
with
mine
he
seemed
to
be
sorry
indeed
i
should
think
he
was
a
reasonable
and
sensible
man
but
he
said
that
he
was
building
to
please
parsons
and
we
both
agreed
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
make
a
fresh
start
he
asked
me
to
send
my
bill
and
we
parted
on
the
best
of
terms
so
it
is
all
over
and
except
from
the
point
of
view
of
dollars
and
cents
i
am
very
glad
only
the
remembrance
that
you
had
set
your
heart
on
my
making
this
my
masterpiece
prevented
me
from
throwing
over
the
contract
weeks
ago
tell
me
selma
that
you
approve
of
what
i
have
done
and
congratulate
me
he
pulled
forward
his
chair
so
that
he
might
see
her
face
without
interference
from
the
lamp
and
leaned
toward
her
with
frank
appeal
yes
i
had
set
my
heart
on
it
and
you
knew
it
yet
you
preferred
to
give
up
this
fine
opportunity
to
show
what
you
could
do
and
to
get
business
worth
having
rather
than
sacrifice
your
own
ideas
as
to
how
a
house
should
be
built
to
the
ideas
of
the
women
who
were
to
live
in
it
i
dare
say
i
should
agree
with
them
and
that
the
things
which
they
wished
and
you
objected
to
were
things
i
would
have
insisted
on
having
littleton
started
as
though
she
had
struck
him
in
the
face
selma
my
wife
do
you
realize
what
you
are
saying
perfectly
then
then
why
what
have
i
said
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
talk
like
this
done
everything
for
one
thing
you
have
thrown
away
the
chance
for
getting
ahead
in
your
profession
which
i
procured
for
you
for
another
by
your
visionary
unpractical
ways
you
have
put
me
in
the
position
where
i
can
be
insulted
read
that
and
judge
for
yourself
she
held
out
to
him
the
newspaper
containing
the
account
of
the
dancing
party
pointing
with
her
finger
to
the
obnoxious
passage
with
nervous
hands
littleton
drew
the
page
under
the
light
what
is
all
this
about
a
party
what
has
it
to
do
with
our
affairs
it
has
this
to
do
with
them
if
you
had
been
more
practical
and
enterprising
our
names
would
have
been
on
that
list
i
am
glad
they
are
not
there
yes
i
know
you
would
be
content
to
have
us
remain
nobodies
all
our
days
you
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
my
life
provided
you
can
carry
out
your
own
narrow
theory
of
how
we
ought
to
live
and
i
had
such
faith
in
you
too
i
have
refused
to
believe
until
now
that
you
were
not
trying
to
make
the
most
of
your
opportunities
and
to
enable
me
to
make
the
most
of
mine
selma
are
you
crazy
to
think
that
you
the
woman
i
have
loved
with
all
my
soul
should
be
capable
of
saying
such
things
to
me
what
does
it
mean
she
was
quick
to
take
advantage
of
his
phrase
have
loved
yes
i
know
that
you
do
not
love
me
as
you
did
otherwise
you
could
not
have
refused
to
build
that
house
against
my
wish
and
advice
it
means
this
wilbur
littleton
that
i
am
determined
not
to
let
you
spoil
my
life
you
forget
that
in
marrying
you
i
gave
up
my
own
ambitions
and
hopes
for
your
sake
because
because
i
believed
that
by
living
together
we
should
be
more
and
accomplish
more
than
by
living
apart
you
said
you
needed
me
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
believe
it
the
fierce
tragedy
in
her
tone
lapsed
into
under
the
influence
of
her
last
thought
and
littleton
eager
in
his
bewilderment
for
some
escape
from
the
horror
of
the
situation
put
aside
his
anger
and
dropping
on
his
knees
beside
her
tried
to
take
her
hands
you
are
provoked
my
darling
do
not
say
things
which
you
will
be
sorry
for
i
call
god
to
witness
that
i
have
sought
above
all
else
to
make
you
happy
and
if
i
have
failed
i
am
utterly
miserable
i
have
needed
you
i
do
need
you
do
not
let
a
single
difference
of
opinion
spoil
the
joy
of
both
our
lives
and
divide
our
hearts
she
pulled
her
hands
away
and
shunning
his
endearment
rose
to
her
feet
i
am
provoked
but
i
know
what
i
am
saying
a
single
difference
of
opinion
do
you
not
see
wilbur
that
none
of
our
opinions
are
the
same
and
that
we
look
at
everything
differently
even
your
religion
and
the
god
you
call
to
witness
are
not
mine
they
are
stiff
and
cold
you
unitarians
permit
your
consciences
to
deaden
your
emotions
and
belittle
your
outlook
on
life
when
i
went
with
parsons
the
other
day
to
the
methodist
church
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
different
it
was
i
was
thrilled
and
i
felt
i
could
do
anything
and
be
anything
my
mother
was
a
methodist
they
sang
christian
soldiers
and
it
was
glorious
she
paused
a
moment
and
with
an
exalted
look
seemed
to
be
recalling
the
movement
of
the
hymn
with
you
wilbur
and
the
people
like
you
pauline
is
the
same
everything
is
measured
and
pondered
over
and
nothing
is
spontaneous
i
like
action
and
progress
and
prompt
sensible
conclusions
that
is
the
american
way
and
the
way
in
which
people
who
succeed
get
on
but
you
wo
see
it
you
ca
see
it
i
tried
to
explain
it
to
you
and
now
now
it
too
late
we
nobodies
and
if
our
hearts
are
divided
that
fate
i
suppose
it
a
very
cruel
fate
for
me
but
i
do
choose
to
remain
a
nobody
littleton
expression
as
she
talked
had
changed
from
astonishment
to
anger
and
from
anger
to
a
sternness
which
gave
his
words
of
response
the
effect
of
calm
and
final
decision
you
have
said
so
many
things
with
which
i
do
not
agree
and
which
i
should
have
to
dispute
that
i
will
not
attempt
to
argue
with
you
concerning
them
one
thing
is
clear
both
of
us
have
made
a
horrible
mistake
each
has
misunderstood
the
other
you
are
dissatisfied
with
me
i
realize
suddenly
that
you
are
utterly
different
from
what
i
supposed
i
am
overwhelmed
but
your
words
make
plain
many
things
which
have
distressed
and
puzzled
me
he
paused
as
though
in
spite
of
the
certainty
of
his
tone
he
hoped
that
she
would
see
fit
to
deny
his
conclusions
we
have
made
a
mistake
and
we
shall
both
be
miserable
that
must
needs
be
but
we
must
consider
whether
there
is
any
method
by
which
we
can
be
less
unhappy
what
would
you
like
to
have
me
do
selma
we
have
no
children
thank
heaven
would
it
be
more
agreeable
to
live
apart
from
me
and
receive
support
a
divorce
does
not
seem
necessary
besides
our
misconception
of
each
other
would
not
be
a
legal
cause
selma
flushed
at
the
reference
to
divorce
littleton
sad
simple
statement
wore
on
the
surface
no
sign
of
a
design
to
hark
back
to
her
experience
with
her
first
husband
yet
she
divined
that
it
must
be
in
his
thoughts
and
she
resented
the
recurrence
moreover
separation
certainly
for
the
present
went
beyond
her
purpose
i
have
no
wish
for
divorce
or
separation
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
continue
to
live
as
we
are
she
answered
to
separate
would
cause
scandal
it
is
not
necessary
that
people
should
know
we
have
made
a
mistake
i
shall
merely
feel
more
free
now
to
live
my
own
life
and
there
is
no
telling
that
you
may
not
some
day
see
things
from
my
point
of
view
and
sympathize
with
me
more
she
uttered
the
last
words
with
a
mixture
of
pathos
and
bright
solicitation
littleton
shook
his
head
i
agree
with
you
that
to
go
on
as
we
are
is
our
best
course
as
you
say
we
ought
if
possible
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
our
sorrow
to
ourselves
god
knows
that
i
wish
i
could
hope
that
our
life
could
ever
be
as
it
was
before
too
many
things
have
become
plain
to
me
in
the
last
to
make
that
possible
i
could
never
learn
to
accept
or
sympathize
with
your
point
of
view
there
can
be
no
with
me
selma
it
is
my
nature
to
be
frank
and
as
you
are
fond
of
saying
that
is
the
american
way
i
am
your
husband
still
and
while
i
live
you
shall
have
my
money
and
my
protection
but
i
have
ceased
to
be
your
lover
though
my
heart
is
broken
very
well
said
selma
after
a
painful
pause
but
you
know
wilbur
she
added
in
a
tone
of
eager
protestation
that
i
do
not
admit
for
a
moment
that
i
am
at
fault
i
was
simply
trying
to
help
you
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
for
your
unhappiness
and
and
for
mine
i
hope
you
understand
that
yes
i
understand
that
you
think
so
he
said
sadly
chapter
ix
the
breach
between
littleton
and
his
wife
was
too
serious
to
be
healed
for
he
was
confronted
by
the
conviction
that
selma
was
a
very
different
being
from
the
woman
whom
he
had
supposed
that
he
was
marrying
he
had
been
slow
to
harbor
distrust
and
loath
even
in
the
face
of
her
own
words
to
admit
that
he
had
misinterpreted
her
character
but
this
last
conversation
left
no
room
for
doubt
selma
had
declared
to
him
unequivocally
that
his
ideas
and
theory
of
life
were
repugnant
to
her
and
that
henceforth
she
intended
to
act
independently
of
them
so
far
as
she
could
do
so
and
yet
maintain
the
semblance
of
the
married
state
it
was
a
cruel
shock
and
disappointment
to
him
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
he
would
have
said
that
the
least
likely
of
possible
happenings
would
be
as
to
the
character
of
the
woman
he
loved
yet
this
was
precisely
what
had
befallen
him
having
realized
his
mistake
he
did
not
seek
to
flinch
from
the
bitter
truth
he
saw
clearly
that
their
future
relations
toward
each
other
must
be
largely
formal
that
tender
comradeship
and
mutual
soul
alliance
were
at
an
end
at
the
same
time
his
simple
direct
conscience
promptly
indicated
to
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
recognize
selma
point
of
view
and
endeavor
to
satisfy
it
as
far
as
he
could
without
sacrifice
of
his
own
principles
he
chose
to
remember
that
she
too
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
husband
whom
she
desired
that
his
tastes
were
not
her
tastes
nor
his
ambitions
her
that
she
had
tastes
and
ambitions
of
her
own
which
he
as
the
man
to
whom
she
was
bound
by
the
law
must
not
disregard
thus
reasoning
he
resolved
to
carry
out
the
scheme
of
life
which
she
appeared
to
despise
but
also
to
work
hard
to
provide
her
with
the
means
to
fulfil
her
own
aims
she
craved
money
for
social
advancement
she
should
have
it
from
him
for
there
was
no
other
source
from
which
she
could
obtain
it
the
poignancy
of
his
own
sorrow
should
not
cause
him
to
ignore
that
she
had
given
up
her
own
career
and
pursuits
in
order
to
become
his
wife
and
was
now
disappointed
and
without
independent
resources
his
pride
was
sorely
wounded
his
ideals
shattered
and
his
heart
crushed
yet
though
he
could
not
forbear
from
judging
selma
and
was
unconscious
of
having
failed
in
his
obligations
to
her
as
a
husband
and
a
man
he
saw
what
she
called
her
side
and
he
took
up
the
thread
of
life
again
under
the
spur
of
an
intention
to
give
her
everything
but
love
on
her
part
selma
felt
aggrieved
yet
emancipated
she
had
not
looked
for
any
such
grave
result
from
her
vituperation
she
had
intended
to
reprove
his
surrender
of
the
parsons
contract
in
direct
opposition
to
her
own
wishes
with
the
severity
it
deserved
and
to
let
him
understand
clearly
that
he
was
sacrificing
her
happiness
no
less
than
his
own
by
his
hysterical
folly
when
the
conversation
developed
stubborn
resistance
on
his
part
and
she
realized
that
he
was
defending
and
adhering
to
his
purpose
a
righteous
sense
of
injury
became
predominant
in
her
mind
over
everything
else
all
her
past
wrongs
cried
for
redress
and
she
rejoiced
in
the
opportunity
of
giving
free
vent
to
the
pent
up
grievances
which
had
been
accumulating
for
many
months
even
then
it
was
startling
to
her
that
wilbur
should
suddenly
utter
the
tragic
ultimatum
that
their
happiness
was
at
an
end
and
hint
at
divorce
she
considered
that
she
loved
him
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
could
ever
cease
to
love
her
rather
than
retract
a
word
of
her
own
accusations
she
would
have
let
him
leave
her
then
and
there
to
live
her
own
life
without
protection
or
support
from
him
but
his
calmer
decision
that
they
should
continue
to
live
together
yet
apart
suited
her
better
in
spite
of
his
resolute
mien
she
was
sceptical
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
she
believed
in
her
heart
that
after
a
few
days
of
restraint
they
would
resume
their
former
life
and
that
wilbur
on
reflection
would
appreciate
that
he
had
been
absurd
when
it
became
apparent
that
he
was
not
to
be
appeased
and
that
his
threat
had
been
genuine
selma
accepted
the
new
relation
without
demur
and
prepared
to
play
her
part
in
the
compact
as
though
she
had
been
equally
obdurate
in
her
outcry
for
her
freedom
she
met
reserve
with
reserve
maintaining
rigorously
the
attitude
that
she
had
been
wronged
and
that
he
was
to
blame
meantime
she
watched
him
narrowly
wondering
what
his
grave
sad
demeanor
and
solicitous
politeness
signified
when
presently
it
became
plain
to
her
that
not
merely
she
was
to
be
free
to
follow
her
own
bent
but
that
he
was
ready
to
provide
her
with
the
means
to
carry
out
her
schemes
she
regarded
his
liberality
as
weakness
and
a
sign
that
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
she
was
in
the
right
immediately
and
with
thinly
concealed
triumph
she
planned
to
utilize
the
new
liberty
at
her
disposal
purging
any
scruples
from
her
conscience
by
the
generous
reflection
that
when
wilbur
brow
unbent
and
his
lips
moved
freely
she
would
forgive
him
and
proffer
him
once
more
her
conjugal
counsel
and
sympathy
she
was
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
unless
he
thus
acknowledged
his
shortcomings
and
promised
improvement
the
present
arrangement
was
completely
to
her
liking
and
that
confidence
and
happiness
between
them
would
be
utterly
impossible
she
shed
some
tears
over
the
thought
that
unkind
circumstances
had
robbed
her
of
the
love
by
which
she
had
set
such
store
and
which
she
on
her
part
still
cherished
but
she
comforted
herself
with
the
retort
that
its
loss
was
preferable
to
sacrificing
weakly
the
development
of
her
own
ideas
and
life
to
its
perpetuation
her
flush
of
triumph
was
succeeded
however
by
a
discontented
mood
because
cogitation
constrained
her
to
suspect
that
her
social
progress
might
not
be
so
rapid
as
her
first
rosy
visions
had
suggested
she
counted
on
being
able
to
procure
the
participation
of
wilbur
sufficiently
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
domestic
harmony
this
would
be
for
practical
purposes
a
scarcely
less
effective
furtherance
of
her
plans
than
if
he
were
heartily
in
sympathy
with
them
were
there
not
many
instances
where
busy
husbands
took
part
in
the
social
undertakings
of
their
wives
merely
on
the
surface
to
preserve
appearances
the
attitude
of
wilbur
seemed
reasonably
secure
that
which
harassed
her
as
the
result
of
her
reflections
and
efforts
to
plan
was
the
unpalatable
consciousness
that
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
do
and
that
no
one
even
now
that
she
was
free
appeared
eager
to
extend
to
her
the
hand
of
recognition
she
was
prompt
to
lay
the
blame
of
this
on
her
husband
it
was
he
who
by
preventing
her
from
taking
advantage
of
the
social
opportunities
at
their
disposal
had
consigned
her
to
this
eddy
where
she
was
overlooked
this
seemed
to
her
a
complete
excuse
and
yet
though
she
made
the
most
of
it
it
did
not
satisfy
her
her
helplessness
angered
her
and
aroused
her
old
feelings
of
suspicion
and
resentment
against
the
fashionable
crew
who
appeared
to
be
unaware
of
her
existence
she
was
glad
to
believe
that
the
reason
they
ignored
her
was
because
she
was
too
serious
minded
and
spiritual
to
suit
their
frivolous
and
tastes
sometimes
she
reasoned
that
the
sensible
thing
for
her
to
do
was
to
break
away
from
her
present
life
where
convention
and
caste
trammelled
her
efforts
and
make
a
name
for
herself
as
an
independent
soul
like
margaret
rodney
earle
and
other
women
of
the
republic
with
satisfaction
she
pictured
herself
on
the
lecture
platform
uttering
burning
denunciation
of
the
social
proclivities
of
this
shallow
society
and
initiating
a
crusade
which
should
sweep
it
from
existence
beneath
the
ban
of
the
moral
sense
of
the
thoughtful
people
of
the
country
but
more
frequently
she
nursed
her
resentment
against
williams
to
whom
she
ascribed
the
blame
of
her
isolation
reasoning
that
if
flossy
had
been
a
true
friend
not
even
wilbur
waywardness
would
have
prevented
her
social
recognition
and
success
that
instead
this
volatile
fickle
prattler
had
used
her
so
long
as
she
needed
her
and
then
dropped
her
heartlessly
the
memory
of
flossy
ball
still
rankled
deeply
and
appeared
to
selma
a
more
obvious
and
more
exasperating
insult
as
the
days
passed
without
a
sign
of
explanation
on
the
part
of
her
late
neighbor
and
as
her
new
projects
languished
for
lack
of
a
few
words
of
introduction
here
and
there
which
in
her
opinion
were
all
she
needed
to
ensure
her
enthusiastic
welcome
as
a
social
leader
the
appreciation
that
without
those
words
of
introduction
she
was
helpless
for
the
time
being
focused
her
resentment
already
keen
on
the
successful
flossy
whose
gay
doings
had
disappeared
from
the
public
prints
in
a
blaze
of
glory
with
the
advent
of
the
lenten
season
refusing
to
acknowledge
her
dependence
selma
essayed
several
spasmodic
attempts
to
assert
herself
but
they
proved
unsatisfactory
she
made
the
most
of
parsons
predilection
for
her
society
which
had
not
been
checked
by
wilbur
termination
of
the
contract
she
was
thus
enabled
to
affiliate
with
some
of
their
new
friends
but
she
was
disagreeably
conscious
that
she
was
not
making
real
progress
and
that
and
parsons
and
their
daughter
had
like
herself
been
dropped
by
the
williamses
dropped
skilfully
and
imperceptibly
yet
none
the
less
dropped
two
dinner
parties
which
she
gave
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
to
the
most
important
of
these
new
acquaintances
by
way
of
manifesting
to
wilbur
her
intention
to
enjoy
her
liberty
at
his
expense
left
her
depressed
and
sore
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
flossy
took
it
into
her
head
to
call
on
her
one
of
her
first
lenten
duties
as
she
hastened
to
assure
selma
with
glib
liveliness
as
soon
as
she
entered
flossy
was
in
too
exalted
a
frame
of
mind
too
bubbling
over
with
the
desire
to
recite
her
triumphs
to
have
in
mind
either
her
doubts
concerning
selma
or
the
need
of
being
more
than
mildly
apologetic
for
her
lack
of
devotion
she
felt
friendly
for
she
was
in
good
humor
and
was
naïvely
desirous
to
be
received
in
the
same
spirit
so
that
she
might
unbosom
herself
unreservedly
sweeping
into
the
room
an
animated
vision
of
smiling
stylish
cordiality
she
sought
as
it
were
to
carry
before
her
by
force
of
her
own
radiant
mood
all
obstacles
to
an
amiable
reception
my
dear
we
have
met
for
ages
thank
heaven
lent
has
come
and
now
i
may
see
something
of
you
i
said
to
gregory
only
yesterday
that
i
should
make
a
for
your
house
and
here
i
am
well
dear
how
are
you
all
sorts
of
things
have
happened
selma
since
we
had
a
real
chat
together
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
of
course
you
do
not
long
after
gregory
and
i
were
married
that
i
never
should
be
satisfied
until
one
thing
happened
well
you
may
congratulate
me
it
has
happened
we
dined
a
week
ago
with
my
cousins
the
morton
prices
a
dinner
of
fourteen
all
of
them
just
the
people
i
wished
to
know
was
it
lovely
i
have
waited
for
it
to
come
and
i
moved
a
finger
to
bring
it
about
except
to
ask
them
to
my
dancing
party
i
had
to
do
that
for
after
all
they
are
my
relations
they
accepted
and
came
and
i
was
pleased
by
it
but
they
could
easily
have
ignored
me
afterward
if
they
had
wished
what
really
pleased
me
selma
was
their
asking
me
to
one
of
their
select
dinners
because
because
it
showed
that
we
are
flossy
hesitation
was
due
partly
to
the
inherent
difficulty
of
expressing
her
thought
with
proper
regard
for
modesty
with
her
rise
in
life
she
had
learned
that
unlimited
laudation
of
self
was
not
altogether
consistent
with
fitness
even
in
such
a
confidential
interview
as
the
present
but
she
was
also
disconcerted
by
the
look
in
selma
eyes
a
look
which
at
first
startled
into
momentary
friendliness
by
the
suddenness
of
the
onslaught
had
become
more
and
more
lowering
until
it
was
unpleasantly
suggestive
of
scornful
dislike
while
she
thus
faltered
selma
drily
rounded
out
the
sentence
with
the
words
because
it
showed
that
you
are
somebodies
now
flossy
gave
an
embarrassed
little
laugh
yes
that
what
i
meant
i
see
you
have
a
good
memory
and
it
sounds
nicer
on
your
lips
than
it
would
on
mine
you
have
come
here
on
purpose
to
tell
me
this
said
selma
i
thought
you
would
be
interested
to
hear
that
my
cousins
had
recognized
me
at
last
i
remember
you
thought
it
strange
that
they
should
take
so
little
notice
of
me
flossy
festive
manner
had
disappeared
before
the
tart
reception
of
her
confidences
and
her
keen
wits
baffled
in
their
search
for
flattery
recalled
the
suspicions
which
were
only
slumbering
she
realized
that
selma
was
seriously
offended
with
her
and
though
she
did
not
choose
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
knew
the
cause
she
had
already
guessed
it
an
encounter
at
repartee
had
no
terrors
for
her
if
necessary
and
the
occasion
seemed
to
her
opportune
for
probing
the
accumulating
mysteries
of
selma
hostile
demeanor
yet
without
waiting
for
a
response
to
her
last
remark
she
changed
the
subject
and
said
volubly
i
hear
that
your
husband
has
refused
to
build
the
new
parsons
house
because
parsons
insisted
on
drawing
the
plans
selma
pale
tense
face
flushed
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
was
being
taunted
that
was
littleton
decision
not
mine
i
admire
his
independence
he
was
quite
right
what
do
parsons
or
her
daughter
know
about
architecture
everybody
is
laughing
at
them
you
know
i
consider
your
husband
a
friend
of
mine
selma
and
we
were
friends
too
i
believe
selma
exclaimed
after
a
moment
of
stern
silence
naturally
responded
flossy
with
a
slightly
sardonic
air
prompted
by
the
acerbity
with
which
the
question
was
put
then
if
we
were
friends
are
friends
why
have
you
ceased
to
associate
with
us
simply
because
you
live
in
another
street
and
a
finer
house
flossy
gave
a
gasp
oh
she
said
to
herself
it
true
she
is
jealous
why
did
i
appreciate
it
before
am
i
not
associating
with
you
now
by
calling
on
you
selma
she
said
aloud
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
you
are
calling
on
me
and
you
asked
us
to
dinner
to
meet
to
meet
just
the
people
we
knew
already
and
did
care
to
meet
but
you
have
never
asked
us
to
meet
your
new
friends
and
you
left
us
out
when
you
gave
your
dancing
party
you
do
not
dance
how
do
you
know
i
have
never
associated
you
with
dancing
i
assumed
that
you
did
not
dance
what
grounds
had
you
for
such
an
assumption
really
selma
your
catechism
is
most
extraordinary
excuse
my
smiling
and
i
do
know
how
to
answer
your
questions
your
fierce
questions
any
better
i
did
ask
you
to
my
party
because
i
supposed
that
you
and
your
husband
were
not
interested
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
would
not
know
any
of
the
people
you
have
often
told
me
that
you
thought
they
were
frivolous
i
consider
them
so
still
then
why
do
you
complain
because
because
you
have
not
acted
like
a
friend
your
idea
of
friendship
has
been
to
pour
into
my
ears
day
after
day
how
you
had
been
asked
to
dinner
by
this
person
and
taken
up
by
that
person
until
i
was
weary
of
the
sound
of
your
voice
but
it
seems
not
to
have
occurred
to
you
as
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
friend
and
admirer
of
my
husband
to
introduce
us
to
people
whom
you
were
eager
to
know
and
who
might
have
helped
him
in
his
profession
and
now
after
turning
the
cold
shoulder
on
us
and
omitting
us
from
your
party
because
you
assumed
i
dance
you
have
come
here
this
morning
in
the
name
of
friendship
to
tell
me
that
your
cousins
at
last
have
invited
you
to
dinner
and
yet
you
think
it
strange
that
i
not
interested
that
the
only
reason
you
came
to
let
me
know
that
you
are
a
somebody
now
and
you
expected
me
as
a
friend
and
a
nobody
to
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
flossy
eyes
opened
wide
free
as
she
was
accustomed
to
be
in
her
own
utterances
this
flow
of
bitter
speech
delivered
with
intensity
was
a
new
experience
to
her
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
amused
by
the
indictment
which
caused
her
to
wince
notwithstanding
that
she
deemed
it
slander
moreover
the
insinuation
that
she
had
been
a
bore
was
humiliating
i
shall
not
weary
you
soon
again
with
my
confidences
she
answered
so
it
appears
that
you
were
envious
of
me
all
the
time
that
while
you
were
preaching
to
me
that
fashionable
society
was
hollow
and
you
were
secretly
unhappy
because
you
could
do
what
i
was
doing
because
you
were
invited
too
oh
i
see
it
all
now
clear
as
daylight
i
suspected
the
truth
for
some
time
but
refused
to
credit
it
now
everything
is
explained
i
took
you
at
your
word
i
believed
in
you
and
your
husband
and
looked
up
to
you
as
literary
people
people
who
were
interested
in
fine
and
ennobling
things
i
admired
you
for
the
very
reason
that
i
thought
you
care
and
that
you
did
need
to
care
about
society
and
fashionable
position
i
kept
saying
to
you
that
i
envied
you
your
tastes
and
let
you
see
that
i
considered
myself
your
real
inferior
in
my
determination
to
attract
attention
and
oblige
society
to
notice
us
i
was
guileless
and
simpleton
enough
to
tell
you
of
my
progress
things
i
would
have
blushed
to
tell
another
woman
like
myself
because
i
considered
you
the
embodiment
of
high
aims
and
spiritual
ideas
as
far
superior
to
mine
as
the
poetic
star
is
superior
to
the
garish
electric
light
i
thought
it
might
amuse
you
to
listen
to
my
vanities
instead
it
seems
you
were
masquerading
and
were
eating
your
heart
out
with
envy
of
me
poor
me
you
were
ambitious
to
be
like
me
i
would
be
like
you
for
anything
in
the
world
you
could
if
you
tried
that
one
of
the
things
which
this
extraordinary
interview
has
made
plain
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
you
are
aching
to
be
a
social
success
you
are
not
fit
to
be
i
have
found
that
out
for
certain
it
is
false
exclaimed
selma
with
a
tragic
intonation
you
do
not
understand
i
have
no
wish
to
be
a
social
success
i
should
abhor
to
spend
my
life
after
the
manner
of
you
and
your
associates
what
i
object
to
what
i
complain
of
is
that
in
spite
of
your
fine
words
and
pretended
admiration
of
me
you
have
preferred
these
people
who
are
exclusive
without
a
shadow
of
right
to
me
who
was
your
friend
and
that
you
have
chosen
to
ignore
me
for
the
sake
of
them
and
behaved
as
if
you
thought
i
was
not
their
equal
or
your
equal
that
is
not
friendship
it
is
snobbishness
snobbishness
it
is
very
amusing
amusing
yet
depressing
continued
flossy
without
heed
to
this
asseveration
you
have
proved
one
of
my
ideals
to
be
a
delusion
which
is
sad
she
had
arisen
and
stood
gently
swaying
pendent
by
its
crook
her
gay
parasol
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
seeming
for
once
to
be
choosing
her
words
judicially
when
we
met
first
and
i
nearly
rushed
into
your
arms
i
was
fascinated
and
i
said
to
myself
that
here
was
the
sort
of
american
woman
of
whom
i
had
dreamed
the
sort
of
woman
i
had
fondly
imagined
once
that
i
might
become
i
saw
you
were
unsophisticated
and
different
from
the
conventional
women
to
whom
i
was
accustomed
and
even
at
first
the
things
you
said
every
now
and
then
gave
me
a
creepy
feeling
but
you
were
inspiring
to
look
at
though
now
that
the
scales
have
fallen
from
my
eyes
i
wonder
at
my
infatuation
and
i
continued
to
worship
you
as
a
goddess
on
a
pedestal
i
used
to
say
to
gregory
a
couple
who
are
to
the
manner
born
they
never
have
to
make
believe
they
are
genuinely
free
and
gentle
souls
your
husband
i
ca
believe
that
i
have
been
deluded
in
regard
to
him
also
i
just
wonder
if
you
appreciate
him
if
it
is
possible
that
he
has
been
deluded
also
that
rank
impertinence
i
know
but
after
all
we
are
unbosoming
our
thoughts
to
each
other
and
may
as
well
speak
openly
you
said
just
now
that
it
was
his
decision
not
to
go
on
with
the
parsons
house
did
you
disapprove
of
it
yes
i
disapproved
of
it
answered
selma
with
flashing
eyes
and
what
if
i
did
she
rose
and
stood
confronting
her
visitor
as
though
to
banish
her
from
the
house
i
going
said
flossy
it
none
of
my
concern
of
course
and
aware
that
i
appear
very
rude
i
anxious
though
not
to
lose
faith
in
your
husband
and
now
that
i
begun
to
understand
you
my
wits
are
being
flooded
with
light
i
was
saying
that
you
were
not
fit
to
be
a
social
success
and
i
going
to
tell
you
why
no
one
else
is
likely
to
and
i
just
mischievous
and
frank
enough
you
one
of
those
american
women
i
always
been
curious
to
meet
one
in
all
her
glory
who
believe
that
they
are
born
in
the
complete
panoply
of
flawless
womanhood
that
they
are
by
birthright
consummate
leaders
of
the
world
thought
and
ethics
and
peerless
society
queens
all
this
by
instinct
by
heritage
and
without
education
that
what
you
believe
is
it
and
now
you
are
offended
because
you
have
been
invited
to
become
a
leader
of
new
york
society
you
do
understand
and
i
do
suppose
you
ever
will
understand
that
a
true
lady
a
genuine
society
queen
represents
modesty
and
sweetness
and
and
gentle
thoughts
and
feelings
that
she
is
evolved
by
gradual
processes
from
generation
to
generation
not
ready
made
oh
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
i
quite
aware
that
if
i
were
the
genuine
article
i
should
be
talking
to
you
in
this
fashion
but
there
hope
for
me
because
i
conscious
of
my
shortcomings
and
am
trying
to
correct
them
whereas
you
are
satisfied
and
fail
to
see
the
difference
between
yourself
and
the
women
whom
you
envy
and
sneer
at
pretty
and
smart
and
superficial
and
er
common
and
you
do
know
it
i
rather
dreadful
but
i
learning
i
do
believe
you
will
ever
learn
there
now
i
going
go
cried
selma
with
a
wave
of
her
arm
yes
i
am
one
of
those
women
i
am
proud
to
be
and
you
have
insulted
by
your
aspersions
not
only
me
but
the
spirit
of
independent
and
aspiring
american
womanhood
you
understand
us
you
have
nothing
in
common
with
us
you
think
to
keep
us
down
by
your
barriers
of
caste
borrowed
from
effete
european
courts
but
we
i
the
american
people
defy
you
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
rise
in
our
might
and
teach
you
your
place
go
envy
you
i
would
not
become
one
of
your
frivolous
and
purposeless
set
if
you
were
all
on
your
bended
knees
before
me
oh
yes
you
would
exclaimed
flossy
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
and
it
because
you
not
been
given
the
chance
that
we
have
quarrelled
now
chapter
x
the
morning
after
her
drastic
interview
with
williams
selma
studied
herself
searchingly
in
her
mirror
of
all
flossy
candid
strictures
the
intimation
that
she
was
not
and
never
would
be
completely
a
lady
was
the
only
one
which
rankled
the
effrontery
of
it
made
her
blood
boil
and
yet
she
consulted
her
glass
in
the
seclusion
of
her
chamber
in
order
to
reassure
herself
as
to
the
spiteful
falsity
of
the
criticism
wild
horses
would
not
have
induced
her
to
admit
even
to
herself
that
there
was
the
slightest
ground
for
it
still
it
rankled
thereby
suggesting
a
of
suspicion
on
the
look
out
for
just
such
a
calumny
she
gave
littleton
her
own
version
of
the
quarrel
her
explanation
was
that
she
had
charged
flossy
with
a
lack
of
friendship
in
failing
to
invite
her
to
her
ball
and
convicted
her
of
detestable
snobbery
that
she
had
denounced
this
conduct
in
vigorous
language
that
they
had
parted
in
anger
and
that
all
intercourse
between
them
was
at
an
end
we
understand
each
other
now
she
added
i
have
felt
for
some
time
that
we
were
no
longer
sympathetic
and
that
something
of
this
kind
was
inevitable
i
am
glad
that
we
had
the
chance
to
speak
plainly
for
i
was
able
to
show
her
that
i
had
been
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
cut
loose
from
her
and
her
frivolous
surroundings
i
have
wearied
my
spirit
long
enough
with
listening
to
social
inanities
and
in
lowering
my
standards
to
hers
for
the
sake
of
appearing
friendly
and
conventional
that
is
all
over
now
thank
heaven
it
did
not
occur
to
selma
that
there
was
any
inconsistency
in
these
observations
or
that
they
might
appear
a
partial
vindication
of
her
husband
point
of
view
the
most
salient
effect
of
her
encounter
with
flossy
had
been
suddenly
to
fuse
and
crystallize
her
mixed
and
seemingly
contradictory
ambitions
into
utter
hostility
to
conventional
fashionable
society
even
when
her
heart
had
been
hungering
for
an
invitation
to
flossy
ball
she
considered
that
she
despised
these
people
but
the
interview
had
served
to
establish
her
in
the
glowing
faith
that
they
by
their
inability
to
appreciate
her
had
shown
themselves
unworthy
of
further
consideration
the
desire
which
she
had
experienced
of
late
for
a
renewal
of
her
intimacy
with
earle
and
a
reassertion
of
her
former
life
of
independent
feminine
activity
had
returned
to
her
coupled
with
the
crusading
intention
to
enroll
herself
openly
once
more
in
the
army
of
new
american
women
whose
impending
victorious
campaign
she
had
prophesied
in
her
retort
to
williams
maledictions
she
had
in
her
own
opinion
never
ceased
to
belong
to
this
army
and
she
felt
herself
now
more
firmly
convinced
than
ever
that
the
course
of
life
of
those
who
had
turned
a
cold
shoulder
on
her
was
hostile
to
the
spirit
of
american
institutions
so
far
as
her
husband
was
concerned
imaginative
enterprise
and
the
capacity
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
still
seemed
to
her
of
the
essence
of
fine
character
indeed
she
was
not
conscious
of
any
change
in
her
point
of
view
she
had
resented
flossy
charge
that
she
desired
to
be
a
social
success
and
had
declared
that
her
wounded
feelings
were
solely
due
to
betrayal
of
friendship
not
to
balked
social
ambition
consequently
it
was
no
strain
on
her
conscientiousness
to
feel
that
her
real
sentiments
had
always
been
the
same
nevertheless
she
scrutinized
herself
eagerly
and
long
in
her
mirror
and
the
process
left
her
serious
brow
still
clouded
she
saw
in
the
glass
features
which
seemed
to
her
suggestive
of
superior
womanhood
a
slender
nose
the
nostrils
of
which
dilated
nervously
delicately
thin
compressed
lips
a
pale
transparent
complexion
and
clear
eyes
looking
straight
and
boldly
from
an
anxious
forehead
surmounted
with
a
coiffure
of
elaborately
and
smoothly
arranged
hair
she
saw
indisputable
evidence
that
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
ethically
attractive
but
modishly
unsophisticated
and
physically
undeveloped
girl
who
had
come
to
new
york
five
years
before
for
her
figure
was
compact
without
being
unduly
plump
her
cheeks
becomingly
oval
and
her
toilette
stylish
there
were
rings
on
her
fingers
and
her
was
smart
altogether
the
vision
was
satisfactory
yet
she
recognized
as
she
gazed
that
her
appearance
and
general
effect
were
not
precisely
those
of
flossy
pauline
or
hallett
taylor
she
had
always
prided
herself
on
the
distinction
of
her
face
and
admired
especially
its
freedom
from
gross
or
unintellectual
lines
she
did
not
intend
to
question
its
superiority
now
but
flossy
offensive
words
rang
in
her
ears
and
caused
her
to
gnaw
her
lips
with
annoyance
what
was
the
difference
between
them
flossy
had
dared
to
call
her
common
and
superficial
had
dared
to
insinuate
that
she
never
could
be
a
lady
a
lady
what
was
there
in
her
appearance
not
in
what
way
was
she
the
inferior
of
any
of
them
in
beauty
intelligence
or
character
rigorous
as
was
the
scrutiny
the
face
in
the
mirror
seemed
to
her
an
unanswerable
refutation
of
the
slander
what
was
the
difference
was
it
that
her
eyes
were
keener
and
brighter
her
lips
thinner
and
less
fleshly
her
general
expression
more
and
if
so
were
these
not
signs
of
superiority
signs
that
they
not
she
were
deficient
in
the
attributes
of
the
best
modern
womanhood
in
spite
of
their
affectation
of
exclusiveness
the
result
of
this
process
of
in
her
which
was
not
limited
to
a
single
occasion
established
more
firmly
than
ever
in
selma
opinion
the
malignant
falsity
of
the
imputation
and
yet
she
was
still
haunted
by
it
she
was
tortured
by
the
secret
thought
that
though
her
ambition
had
been
to
become
just
like
those
other
women
she
was
still
distinguishable
from
them
and
moreover
that
she
was
baffled
in
her
attempt
to
analyze
the
distinction
distinguishable
even
from
flossy
from
flossy
who
had
slighted
and
then
reviled
her
why
had
she
ever
faltered
in
her
distrust
of
these
enemies
of
true
american
society
yet
this
lingering
sense
of
torture
served
to
whet
her
purpose
to
have
done
with
them
forever
and
to
obtain
the
recognition
and
power
to
which
she
was
entitled
in
spite
of
their
impertinence
and
neglect
the
announcement
was
made
to
her
by
wilbur
at
about
this
time
that
his
plans
for
wetmore
college
had
been
accepted
and
that
he
was
to
be
the
architect
of
the
new
buildings
as
he
told
her
his
face
showed
a
tremulous
animation
which
it
had
not
worn
for
many
weeks
and
he
regarded
her
for
a
moment
with
shy
eagerness
as
though
he
half
hoped
that
this
vindication
of
his
purposes
by
success
might
prompt
her
to
tender
some
sort
of
apology
and
thus
afford
him
the
chance
to
persuade
himself
that
he
had
been
mistaken
after
all
in
his
judgment
of
her
you
must
be
very
much
pleased
she
said
and
so
am
i
of
course
then
after
a
moment
of
reflective
abstraction
she
asked
with
sudden
eagerness
how
long
will
it
take
to
build
them
two
or
three
years
i
suppose
and
you
would
be
obliged
to
go
frequently
to
benham
in
order
to
oversee
the
work
i
should
have
to
make
short
trips
there
from
time
to
time
yes
wilbur
she
exclaimed
with
her
exalted
expression
why
should
we
go
to
benham
to
live
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
lately
about
what
we
said
to
each
other
that
time
when
you
felt
so
badly
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
living
in
new
york
is
what
is
really
the
trouble
i
have
the
feeling
wilbur
that
in
some
other
place
than
this
cruel
conventional
city
we
should
be
happier
than
we
are
now
indeed
very
happy
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
you
see
new
york
does
understand
me
it
does
understand
you
wilbur
it
sneers
at
our
aspirations
benham
is
a
growing
earnest
city
a
city
throbbing
with
the
best
american
spirit
and
energy
i
suggest
benham
because
we
both
know
it
so
well
the
college
buildings
would
give
you
a
grand
start
and
i
we
both
would
be
in
our
proper
sphere
littleton
had
started
at
the
suggestion
as
a
drowning
man
will
grasp
at
a
straw
his
grieving
soul
for
an
instant
entertained
the
plan
as
a
panacea
for
their
woes
but
his
brow
grew
grave
and
sad
under
the
influence
of
reflection
as
she
proceeded
to
set
forth
her
reasons
in
her
wrapt
fashion
if
he
had
not
learned
to
remain
cold
under
the
witchery
of
her
intense
moods
he
no
longer
hesitated
to
probe
her
fervid
assertions
with
his
i
would
he
willing
to
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
selma
he
answered
if
i
believed
that
by
so
doing
you
and
i
could
become
what
we
once
were
to
each
other
but
i
can
not
see
why
we
should
hope
to
be
happier
in
benham
than
here
nor
do
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
not
our
proper
sphere
i
do
not
share
your
sentiments
in
regard
to
new
york
but
whatever
its
faults
new
york
is
the
place
where
i
have
established
myself
and
am
known
and
where
the
abilities
which
i
possess
can
be
utilized
and
will
be
appreciated
soonest
benham
is
years
behind
this
city
in
all
things
which
concern
art
and
my
professional
life
as
you
well
know
selma
flushed
on
the
contrary
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
benham
has
made
wonderful
progress
in
the
last
five
years
my
friends
there
write
that
there
are
many
new
streets
and
beautiful
buildings
and
that
the
spirit
of
the
place
is
enthusiastic
and
liberal
not
luxurious
and
sneering
you
never
appreciated
benham
at
its
true
worth
wilbur
perhaps
not
but
we
chose
new
york
then
you
insist
on
remaining
here
i
see
no
reason
for
sacrificing
the
fruits
of
the
past
five
years
for
pulling
myself
up
by
the
roots
and
making
a
fresh
start
from
a
professional
point
of
view
i
think
it
would
be
madness
not
even
to
save
our
happiness
selma
eyes
swam
and
her
lips
trembled
as
she
spoke
she
felt
very
miserable
and
she
yearned
with
the
desire
that
her
husband
would
clasp
her
in
his
arms
in
a
vast
embrace
and
tell
her
that
she
was
right
and
that
he
would
go
she
felt
that
if
he
did
the
horror
of
the
past
would
be
wiped
out
and
loving
harmony
be
restored
wilbur
lips
trembled
too
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
without
speaking
in
conflict
with
himself
then
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
though
he
would
sweep
away
a
misty
spell
from
his
eyes
said
be
sensible
selma
if
we
could
be
happy
in
benham
we
should
be
happy
here
then
you
refuse
for
the
present
yes
and
i
must
remain
here
to
be
insulted
and
a
nobody
for
god
sake
selma
let
us
not
renew
that
discussion
what
you
ask
is
impossible
at
present
but
i
shall
remember
that
it
is
your
wish
and
when
i
begin
my
work
at
benham
the
circumstances
and
surroundings
may
be
such
that
i
shall
feel
willing
to
move
selma
turned
to
the
table
and
took
up
a
book
dissatisfied
yet
buoyed
by
a
new
hope
she
did
not
observe
the
tired
lines
on
her
face
the
weariness
of
a
soul
disappointed
in
its
most
precious
aspirations
within
the
next
month
it
happened
that
a
terrible
and
unusual
fatality
was
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
both
parsons
and
her
daughter
they
were
killed
by
a
fall
of
the
elevator
at
the
hotel
in
which
they
were
living
one
of
those
dire
casualties
which
are
liable
to
happen
to
any
one
of
us
in
these
days
of
swift
and
complicated
apparatus
but
which
always
seem
remote
from
personal
experience
this
cruel
blow
of
fate
put
an
end
to
all
desire
on
the
part
of
the
bereaved
husband
and
father
to
remain
in
new
york
whither
he
had
come
to
live
mainly
to
please
his
women
folk
as
he
called
them
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
bewilderment
of
the
shock
parsons
sent
for
the
architect
who
had
taken
littleton
place
and
who
had
just
begun
the
subservient
task
of
fusing
diverse
types
of
architecture
in
order
to
satisfy
an
american
woman
appetite
for
startling
effect
and
told
him
to
arrange
to
dispose
of
the
lot
and
its
immature
walls
to
the
highest
bidder
his
precise
plans
for
the
future
were
still
uncertain
when
selma
called
on
him
and
found
comfort
for
her
own
miseries
in
ministering
to
his
solitude
but
he
expressed
an
inclination
to
return
to
his
native
western
town
as
the
most
congenial
spot
in
which
to
end
his
days
selma
whose
soul
was
full
of
benham
suggested
it
as
an
alternative
enlarging
with
contagious
enthusiasm
on
its
civic
merits
the
crushed
old
man
listened
with
growing
attention
already
the
germs
of
a
plan
for
the
disposition
of
his
large
property
were
sprouting
in
his
mind
to
provide
him
with
a
refuge
from
despondency
he
was
a
reticent
man
not
in
the
habit
of
confiding
his
affairs
until
ready
to
act
but
he
paid
interested
heed
to
selma
eulogy
of
the
bustling
energy
and
rapid
growth
of
benham
his
preliminary
thought
had
been
that
it
would
make
him
happy
to
endow
his
native
town
which
was
a
small
and
inconspicuous
place
with
a
library
building
but
as
his
visitor
referred
to
the
attractions
and
admirable
public
spirit
of
the
thriving
city
which
was
in
the
same
state
as
his
own
home
he
silently
reasoned
that
residence
there
need
not
interfere
with
his
original
project
and
that
he
might
find
a
wide
and
more
important
field
for
his
benefactions
in
a
community
so
representative
of
american
ideas
and
principles
selma
visits
of
condolence
to
parsons
were
interrupted
by
the
illness
of
her
own
husband
in
reflecting
subsequently
she
remembered
that
he
had
seemed
weary
and
out
of
sorts
for
several
days
but
her
conscious
attention
was
invoked
by
his
coming
home
early
in
the
afternoon
suffering
from
a
violent
chill
and
manifestly
in
a
state
of
physical
collapse
he
went
to
bed
at
once
selma
brought
blankets
and
a
bottle
and
george
page
was
sent
for
dr
page
was
the
one
of
littleton
friends
whom
selma
had
unsuccessfully
yearned
to
know
better
she
had
never
been
able
to
understand
him
exactly
but
he
fascinated
her
in
spite
of
perhaps
because
of
his
bantering
manner
she
found
difficulty
in
reconciling
it
with
his
reputation
for
hard
work
and
masterly
skill
in
his
profession
she
was
constantly
hoping
to
extract
from
him
something
worthy
of
his
large
solid
face
with
its
firm
mouth
and
general
expression
of
reserve
force
but
he
seemed
always
bent
on
talking
nonsense
in
her
society
and
more
than
once
the
disagreeable
thought
had
occurred
to
her
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
he
had
come
to
the
house
after
her
marriage
now
and
then
but
during
the
past
year
or
two
she
had
scarcely
seen
him
the
last
time
when
they
had
met
selma
had
taxed
him
with
his
neglect
of
her
his
reply
had
been
characteristically
elusive
and
unsatisfactory
i
will
not
attempt
to
frame
excuses
for
my
behavior
littleton
for
no
reason
which
i
could
offer
would
be
a
justification
but
on
the
present
occasion
his
greeting
was
grave
and
eager
wilbur
sick
i
feared
as
much
i
warned
pauline
two
months
ago
that
he
was
overworking
and
only
last
week
i
told
him
that
he
would
break
down
if
he
did
not
go
away
for
a
fortnight
rest
i
wish
you
had
spoken
to
me
selma
noted
with
satisfaction
that
there
was
no
raillery
in
his
manner
now
he
bent
his
gaze
on
her
searchingly
have
you
not
noticed
that
he
looked
ill
and
tired
she
did
not
flinch
why
indeed
should
she
a
little
he
tired
himself
i
think
over
the
designs
for
wetmore
college
which
he
did
in
addition
to
his
other
work
but
since
the
award
was
made
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
looking
better
she
started
to
lead
the
way
to
wilbur
room
but
the
doctor
paused
and
regarding
her
again
fixedly
as
though
he
had
formed
a
resolution
to
ferret
the
secrets
of
her
soul
said
laconically
is
he
happy
happy
she
echoed
has
he
anything
on
his
mind
i
mean
anything
except
his
work
nothing
that
is
she
added
looking
up
at
her
inquisitor
with
bright
interested
eyes
nothing
except
that
he
is
very
conscientious
i
sometimes
think
to
be
bandying
psychological
analyses
with
this
able
man
was
an
edifying
experience
despite
her
concern
for
wilbur
i
see
he
answered
dryly
and
for
an
instant
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
yet
he
added
to
make
a
correct
diagnosis
it
is
important
to
know
all
the
facts
of
the
case
of
course
she
said
solemnly
reassured
in
her
belief
that
she
was
being
consulted
and
was
taking
part
in
the
treatment
of
her
malady
she
accompanied
dr
page
to
wilbur
he
conversed
in
a
cheery
tone
with
his
friend
while
he
took
his
temperature
and
made
what
seemed
to
her
a
comparatively
brief
examination
selma
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
serious
the
matter
the
moment
they
had
left
the
room
the
doctor
manner
changed
and
he
said
with
alert
concern
your
husband
is
very
ill
he
has
pneumonia
i
am
going
to
send
for
a
nurse
a
nurse
i
will
nurse
him
myself
dr
page
it
seemed
to
her
the
obvious
thing
to
do
she
spoke
proudly
for
it
flashed
into
her
mind
that
here
was
the
opportunity
to
redeem
the
situation
with
wilbur
she
would
tend
him
devotedly
and
when
he
had
been
restored
to
health
by
her
loving
skill
perhaps
he
would
appreciate
her
at
her
worth
and
recognize
that
she
had
thwarted
him
only
to
help
him
the
doctor
brow
darkened
and
he
said
with
an
emphasis
which
was
almost
stern
littleton
i
do
not
wish
to
alarm
you
but
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
that
wilbur
symptoms
are
grave
i
hope
to
save
his
life
but
it
can
be
saved
only
by
trained
skill
and
attendance
inexperienced
assistance
however
devoted
would
be
of
no
use
in
a
case
like
this
but
i
only
wished
to
nurse
him
i
know
it
i
understand
perfectly
you
supposed
that
anyone
could
do
that
at
least
that
you
could
i
shall
return
in
an
hour
at
the
latest
with
a
nurse
who
was
trained
for
three
years
in
a
hospital
to
fit
her
to
battle
for
valuable
lives
selma
flushed
with
annoyance
she
felt
that
she
was
being
ridiculed
and
treated
as
though
she
were
an
incapable
doll
she
divined
that
by
his
raillery
he
had
been
making
fun
of
her
and
forthwith
her
predilection
was
turned
to
resentment
not
nurse
her
husband
did
this
doctor
realize
that
as
a
girl
she
had
been
the
constant
attendant
of
her
invalid
father
and
that
more
than
once
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
her
true
mission
in
life
might
be
to
become
a
nurse
training
she
would
prove
to
him
that
she
needed
no
further
training
these
were
her
thoughts
and
she
felt
like
crying
because
he
had
humiliated
her
at
a
time
like
this
yet
she
had
let
dr
page
go
without
a
word
she
returned
to
wilbur
and
established
herself
beside
his
bed
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
coming
i
think
i
shall
be
better
it
is
only
a
heavy
cold
he
said
but
already
he
found
difficulty
in
speaking
i
have
come
to
nurse
you
the
blankets
and
bottle
have
made
you
warmer
have
they
nod
you
must
talk
yes
he
whispered
huskily
she
felt
his
forehead
and
it
was
burning
she
took
his
hand
and
saying
sh
you
ought
not
to
talk
held
it
in
her
own
then
there
was
silence
save
for
wilbur
uneasy
turning
it
was
plain
that
he
was
very
uncomfortable
she
realized
that
he
was
growing
worse
and
though
she
chose
to
believe
that
the
doctor
had
exaggerated
the
seriousness
of
the
case
in
order
to
affront
her
the
thought
came
that
he
might
die
she
had
never
considered
such
a
possibility
before
what
should
she
do
she
would
be
a
widow
without
children
and
without
means
for
she
knew
that
wilbur
had
laid
up
little
if
anything
she
would
have
to
begin
life
over
again
a
pathetic
prospect
yet
interesting
even
this
conjecture
of
such
a
dire
result
conjured
up
a
variety
of
possible
methods
of
livelihood
and
occupation
which
sped
through
her
mind
the
return
of
dr
page
with
a
nurse
cut
short
these
painful
yet
engrossing
speculations
his
offensive
manner
appeared
to
have
exhausted
itself
but
he
proceeded
to
install
his
companion
in
wilbur
room
selma
would
have
liked
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
but
realized
that
she
could
not
run
the
risk
of
taking
issue
with
him
at
a
time
when
her
husband
life
might
be
in
danger
with
an
injured
air
yet
in
silence
she
beheld
the
deliberate
yet
swift
preparations
once
or
twice
dr
page
asked
her
to
procure
for
him
some
article
or
appliance
likely
to
be
in
the
house
speaking
with
a
crisp
preoccupation
which
virtually
ignored
her
existence
yet
was
free
from
offence
his
soul
evidently
was
absorbed
by
his
patient
whom
he
observed
with
alert
watchfulness
issuing
brief
directions
now
and
then
to
his
methodical
and
noiseless
assistant
selma
sat
with
her
hands
before
her
in
a
corner
of
the
practically
ignored
the
shadows
deepened
and
a
maid
announced
dinner
dr
page
looked
at
his
watch
i
shall
pass
the
night
here
he
said
is
he
worse
the
disease
is
making
progress
and
must
run
its
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
you
should
eat
your
dinner
for
you
will
need
your
strength
he
added
with
simple
graciousness
but
i
am
doing
nothing
she
blurted
if
there
is
anything
you
can
do
i
will
let
you
know
their
eyes
met
his
were
gray
and
steady
but
kind
she
felt
that
he
chose
to
treat
her
like
a
child
yet
that
he
was
trying
to
be
considerate
she
was
galled
but
after
all
he
was
the
doctor
and
wilbur
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
him
so
she
must
submit
she
ate
her
dinner
and
when
she
returned
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
night
the
nurse
was
to
use
a
lounge
at
the
foot
of
wilbur
bed
dr
page
asked
permission
to
occupy
the
adjoining
so
as
to
be
within
easy
call
he
established
himself
there
with
a
book
returning
at
short
intervals
to
look
at
his
patient
selma
had
resumed
her
seat
it
was
dark
save
for
a
night
lamp
in
the
stillness
the
only
sounds
were
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
and
wilbur
labored
breathing
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
struggling
for
his
life
what
should
she
do
if
he
died
why
was
she
debarred
from
tending
him
it
was
cruel
tears
fell
on
her
hand
she
stared
into
the
darkness
twisting
her
fingers
until
at
last
as
though
to
show
her
independence
she
stepped
to
the
bed
on
wilbur
eyes
were
open
he
put
out
his
hand
and
taking
hers
touched
it
to
his
burning
lips
selma
he
murmured
she
stooped
and
kissed
his
brow
i
am
here
beside
you
wilbur
a
figure
stood
behind
her
she
turned
expecting
to
encounter
the
sentinel
it
was
dr
page
he
touched
her
gently
on
the
arm
we
must
let
him
rest
now
you
can
do
no
good
wo
you
go
to
bed
oh
no
i
shall
sit
with
him
all
night
very
well
but
it
is
important
that
you
should
not
speak
to
him
he
said
with
another
touch
of
emphasis
she
resumed
her
seat
and
sat
out
the
night
and
conscious
of
each
movement
on
wilbur
part
he
was
restless
and
moaning
twice
the
nurse
summoned
the
doctor
and
two
or
three
times
he
came
to
the
of
his
own
accord
she
felt
slighted
and
once
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
wilbur
was
in
distress
and
anxious
for
something
she
forestalled
the
nurse
he
wishes
water
selma
said
sternly
and
she
fetched
a
glass
from
the
table
and
let
him
drink
dr
page
took
breakfast
with
her
she
was
conscious
that
somehow
her
vigil
had
affected
his
estimate
of
her
for
his
speech
was
frank
and
direct
as
though
he
considered
her
now
more
fit
to
be
treated
with
confidence
he
is
very
ill
but
he
is
holding
his
own
if
you
will
lie
down
for
a
few
hours
i
will
call
you
to
take
miss
barker
place
while
she
rests
this
was
gratifying
and
tended
to
assuage
her
bitterness
but
the
doctor
appeared
to
her
anxious
and
spent
only
a
few
minutes
at
table
he
said
as
he
rose
excuse
me
but
pauline
does
she
know
i
will
send
her
word
selma
would
have
been
glad
to
dispense
with
the
presence
of
her
their
relations
had
not
been
sympathetic
since
the
episode
of
miss
bailey
and
though
pauline
still
dined
at
the
house
once
a
week
the
intercourse
between
them
had
become
reserved
and
perfunctory
she
grudged
sharing
with
her
what
might
be
wilbur
last
hours
she
grudged
too
permitting
her
to
help
to
nurse
him
especially
now
that
her
own
capabilities
were
in
the
way
of
being
recognized
for
she
remembered
dr
page
partiality
for
her
still
she
appreciated
that
she
must
let
her
know
pauline
arrived
speedily
and
selma
found
herself
sobbing
in
her
arms
she
was
pleased
by
this
rush
of
feeling
on
her
own
part
and
confirmed
in
her
belief
that
her
was
cold
because
she
did
not
break
down
and
shrinking
from
her
efforts
to
comfort
her
she
quickly
regained
her
pauline
seemed
composed
and
cheerful
but
the
unceasing
watchfulness
and
manifest
tension
of
the
doctor
were
disconcerting
and
as
the
afternoon
shadows
deepened
the
two
women
sat
grave
and
silent
appalled
by
the
suspicion
that
wilbur
condition
was
eminently
critical
yet
dr
page
volunteered
to
say
to
them
presently
if
his
heart
holds
out
i
am
hopeful
that
he
will
pull
through
dr
page
had
given
up
all
his
duties
for
the
sake
of
wilbur
he
never
left
the
house
manifestly
devoting
as
shown
by
the
unflagging
absorbed
scrutiny
with
which
he
noted
every
symptom
and
change
the
fullest
measure
of
his
professional
skill
and
a
purpose
to
save
his
friend
life
if
human
brain
or
human
concentration
could
avail
and
yet
he
stated
to
pauline
in
selma
hearing
that
beyond
keeping
up
the
patient
strength
by
stimulants
science
was
practically
helpless
and
that
all
they
could
do
was
to
wait
and
so
they
sat
still
and
unemployed
watchers
while
day
turned
into
darkness
from
time
to
time
by
the
selma
saw
pauline
smiling
at
her
as
though
in
defiance
of
whatever
fate
might
have
in
store
selma
herself
felt
the
inclination
neither
to
smile
nor
to
weep
she
sat
looking
before
her
with
her
hands
clasped
resenting
the
powerlessness
of
the
few
remedies
used
and
impatient
of
the
inactivity
and
relentless
silence
why
did
not
the
doctor
adopt
more
stringent
measures
surely
there
was
something
to
be
done
to
enable
wilbur
to
combat
the
disease
dr
page
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
skilful
physician
and
presumably
was
doing
his
best
but
was
it
not
possible
was
it
not
sensible
to
suppose
there
was
a
different
and
better
way
of
treating
pneumonia
a
way
which
was
as
superior
to
the
conventional
and
stereotyped
method
as
the
true
american
point
of
view
was
superior
in
other
matters
it
came
over
her
as
a
conviction
that
if
she
were
elsewhere
in
benham
for
instance
her
husband
could
be
readily
and
brilliantly
cured
this
impassive
mode
of
treatment
seemed
to
her
of
one
piece
with
the
entire
littleton
surroundings
the
culmination
of
which
was
pauline
smiling
in
the
face
of
death
she
yearned
to
do
something
active
and
decided
yet
how
helpless
she
was
this
arbitrary
doctor
was
following
his
own
dictates
without
a
word
to
anyone
and
without
suspecting
the
existence
of
wiser
expedients
in
a
moment
of
rebellion
she
rose
and
swiftly
approaching
wilbur
bed
exclaimed
fervently
is
there
not
something
we
can
do
for
you
darling
something
you
feel
will
do
you
good
the
sufferer
faintly
smiled
and
feebly
shook
his
head
and
at
the
same
moment
she
was
drawn
away
by
a
firm
hand
and
dr
page
whispered
he
is
very
weak
entire
rest
is
his
only
chance
the
least
exertion
is
a
drain
on
his
vitality
surely
there
must
be
some
medicine
some
powerful
application
which
will
help
his
breathing
she
retorted
and
she
detected
again
the
semblance
of
laughter
in
the
doctor
eyes
everything
which
modern
science
can
do
is
being
done
mrs
littleton
what
was
there
but
to
resume
her
seat
and
helpless
vigil
modern
science
the
word
grated
on
her
ears
it
savored
to
her
of
narrow
medical
tyranny
and
distrust
of
aspiring
individuality
wilbur
was
dying
and
all
modern
science
saw
fit
to
do
was
to
give
him
brandy
and
wait
and
she
his
wife
the
one
who
loved
him
best
in
the
world
was
powerless
to
intervene
nay
she
had
intervened
and
modern
science
had
mocked
her
selma
eyes
like
the
glint
of
two
swords
bent
themselves
on
her
husband
bed
a
righteous
anger
reinforced
her
grieving
heart
and
made
her
spirit
militant
while
the
creeping
hours
passed
over
and
over
she
pursued
the
tenor
of
her
protest
until
her
wearied
system
sought
refuge
in
sleep
she
was
not
conscious
of
slumbering
but
she
reasoned
later
that
she
must
have
slept
for
she
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
and
a
vibrant
utterance
of
her
name
selma
selma
you
must
come
at
once
her
returning
wits
realized
that
it
was
pauline
who
was
arousing
her
and
urging
her
to
wilbur
she
sprang
forward
and
saw
the
light
of
existence
fading
from
her
husband
eyes
into
the
mute
dulness
of
death
dr
page
was
bending
over
him
in
a
desperate
but
vain
effort
to
force
some
restorative
between
his
lips
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
the
nurse
with
an
expression
which
betrayed
what
had
occurred
what
is
it
wilbur
what
have
they
done
to
you
what
has
happened
selma
cried
looking
from
one
to
the
other
though
she
had
discerned
the
truth
in
a
flash
as
she
spoke
dr
page
desisted
from
his
undertaking
and
stepped
back
from
the
bed
and
instantly
selma
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
pressed
her
face
upon
littleton
lifeless
features
there
was
no
response
his
spirit
had
departed
his
heart
could
not
stand
the
strain
that
is
the
great
peril
in
pneumonia
she
heard
the
doctor
murmur
he
is
dead
she
cried
in
a
horrified
outburst
and
she
looked
up
at
the
pitying
group
with
the
gaze
of
an
afflicted
lioness
she
caught
sight
of
pauline
smiling
through
her
tears
that
same
unprotesting
submissive
smile
and
holding
out
her
hands
to
her
selma
rising
turned
away
and
as
her
sought
to
put
her
arm
about
her
evaded
the
caress
no
no
she
said
then
facing
her
added
with
aggrieved
conviction
i
can
not
believe
that
wilbur
death
was
necessary
why
was
not
something
energetic
done
pauline
flushed
but
ascribing
the
calumny
to
distress
she
held
her
peace
and
said
simply
sh
dear
you
will
understand
better
by
and
by
book
iii
the
success
chapter
i
it
had
never
occurred
to
selma
that
she
might
lose
her
husband
even
with
his
shortcomings
he
was
so
important
to
her
from
the
point
of
view
of
support
and
her
scheme
of
life
was
so
interwoven
with
his
she
had
taken
for
granted
that
he
would
live
as
long
as
she
desired
she
felt
that
destiny
had
a
second
time
been
signally
cruel
to
her
and
that
she
was
drinking
deeply
of
the
cup
of
sorrow
she
was
convinced
that
wilbur
had
he
lived
would
have
moved
presently
to
benham
in
accordance
with
her
desire
and
that
they
would
then
have
been
completely
happy
again
instead
he
was
dead
and
under
the
sod
and
she
was
left
to
face
the
world
with
no
means
save
from
his
life
insurance
and
the
natural
gifts
and
soul
which
god
had
given
her
she
appreciated
that
she
was
still
a
comparatively
young
woman
and
that
notwithstanding
her
love
for
wilbur
she
had
been
unable
as
his
wife
to
exhibit
herself
to
the
world
in
her
true
light
she
was
free
once
more
to
lead
her
own
life
and
to
obtain
due
recognition
for
her
ideas
and
principles
she
deplored
with
a
grief
which
depleted
the
curve
of
her
oval
cheeks
the
premature
end
of
her
husband
artistic
career
an
aspiring
soul
cut
off
on
the
threshold
of
success
yet
though
of
course
she
never
squarely
made
the
reflection
she
was
aware
that
the
development
of
her
own
life
was
more
intrinsically
valuable
to
the
world
than
his
and
that
of
the
two
it
was
best
that
he
should
be
taken
she
was
sad
sore
against
providence
and
uncertain
as
to
the
future
but
she
was
keenly
conscious
that
she
had
a
future
and
she
was
eager
to
be
stirring
still
for
the
moment
the
outlook
was
perplexing
what
was
she
to
do
first
and
certainly
she
desired
to
shake
the
dust
of
new
york
from
her
feet
at
the
earliest
opportunity
she
inclined
toward
benham
as
a
residence
and
to
the
lecture
platform
supplemented
by
literature
and
perhaps
eventually
the
stage
as
a
means
of
livelihood
she
believed
in
her
secret
soul
that
she
could
act
her
supposed
facility
in
acquiring
the
new
york
manner
had
helped
to
generate
that
impression
it
seemed
to
her
more
than
probable
that
with
a
little
instruction
as
to
technical
stage
business
she
could
gain
fame
and
fortune
almost
at
once
as
an
actress
of
tragedy
or
melodrama
comedy
she
despised
as
unworthy
of
her
but
the
stage
appealed
to
her
only
on
the
ground
of
income
the
life
of
an
actress
lacked
the
ethical
character
which
she
liked
to
associate
with
whatever
she
did
to
be
sure
a
great
actress
was
an
inspiring
influence
nevertheless
she
preferred
some
more
obviously
improving
occupation
provided
it
would
afford
a
suitable
support
yet
was
it
fitting
that
she
should
be
condemned
to
do
hack
work
for
her
daily
bread
instead
of
something
to
enlighten
and
uplift
the
community
in
which
she
lived
she
considered
that
she
had
served
her
apprenticeship
by
teaching
school
and
writing
for
the
newspapers
and
she
begrudged
spending
further
time
in
subordinate
work
better
on
the
whole
a
striking
success
on
the
stage
than
this
for
after
she
had
made
a
name
and
money
she
could
retire
and
devote
herself
to
more
congenial
undertakings
nevertheless
her
conscience
told
her
that
a
theatrical
career
must
be
regarded
as
a
last
resort
and
she
appreciated
the
importance
of
not
making
a
hasty
decision
as
to
what
she
would
do
the
lease
of
her
house
would
not
expire
for
six
months
and
it
seemed
to
her
probable
that
even
in
new
york
where
she
was
not
understood
someone
would
realize
her
value
as
a
manager
of
some
intellectual
or
literary
movement
and
make
overtures
to
her
she
wrote
to
earle
and
received
a
cordial
response
declaring
that
benham
would
welcome
her
with
open
arms
a
complimentary
though
somewhat
vague
certificate
she
sent
a
line
also
to
dennison
informing
him
that
she
hoped
soon
to
submit
some
short
stories
for
his
magazine
and
received
a
guarded
but
polite
reply
to
the
effect
that
he
would
be
glad
to
read
her
manuscripts
while
she
was
thus
deliberating
and
winding
up
her
husband
affairs
parsons
who
had
been
absent
from
new
york
at
the
time
of
decease
called
and
bluntly
made
the
announcement
that
he
had
bought
a
house
in
benham
was
to
move
there
immediately
and
was
desirous
that
she
should
live
with
him
as
his
companion
and
housekeeper
on
liberal
pecuniary
terms
i
am
an
old
man
he
said
and
my
health
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
i
need
someone
to
look
after
me
and
to
keep
me
company
i
like
your
chatty
ways
and
if
i
have
someone
smart
and
brisk
around
like
you
i
be
thinking
so
often
that
i
all
alone
in
the
world
it
be
dull
for
you
i
guess
but
you
be
keeping
quiet
for
the
present
wherever
you
are
and
when
the
time
comes
that
you
wish
to
take
notice
again
i
stand
in
the
way
of
your
amusing
yourself
to
this
homely
plea
selma
returned
a
beatific
smile
it
struck
her
as
an
ideal
arrangement
a
golden
opportunity
for
him
and
convenient
and
promising
for
her
in
the
first
place
she
was
accorded
the
mission
of
cheering
and
guarding
the
declining
years
of
this
fine
old
man
whom
she
had
come
to
look
on
with
esteem
and
liking
and
at
the
same
time
as
his
companion
the
virtual
mistress
of
his
house
for
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
as
a
genuine
american
he
was
not
offering
her
a
position
less
than
this
she
would
be
able
to
shape
her
life
gradually
along
congenial
lines
and
to
wait
for
the
ripe
occasion
for
usefulness
to
present
itself
in
an
instant
a
great
load
was
lifted
from
her
spirit
she
was
thankful
to
be
spared
conscientious
qualms
concerning
the
career
of
an
actress
and
thankful
to
be
freed
at
one
bound
from
her
new
york
associations
especially
with
pauline
whose
attitude
toward
her
had
been
further
strained
by
her
continued
conviction
that
wilbur
life
might
have
been
saved
indeed
so
completely
alleviating
was
parsons
proposition
that
stimulated
by
the
thought
that
he
was
to
be
a
greater
gainer
from
the
plan
than
she
selma
gave
rein
to
her
emotions
by
exclaiming
with
fervor
usually
i
like
to
think
important
plans
over
before
coming
to
a
decision
but
this
arrangement
seems
to
me
so
sensible
and
natural
and
mutually
advantageous
parsons
that
i
see
no
reason
why
i
accept
your
offer
now
god
grant
that
i
may
be
a
worthy
daughter
to
you
and
in
some
measure
take
the
place
of
the
dear
ones
you
have
lost
that
what
i
want
he
said
i
took
a
liking
to
you
the
first
time
we
met
then
it
settled
yes
i
suppose
she
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
speaking
with
an
accent
of
scorn
i
suppose
there
may
be
people
people
like
those
who
are
called
fashionable
here
who
will
criticise
the
arrangement
on
the
ground
er
of
propriety
because
i
not
a
relation
and
you
are
not
very
old
but
i
despise
conventions
such
as
that
they
may
be
necessary
for
foreigners
but
they
are
not
meant
for
american
women
i
fancy
my
may
not
wholly
approve
of
it
but
i
do
know
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
showing
her
and
the
rest
that
it
would
be
wicked
as
well
as
foolish
to
let
a
flimsy
suggestion
of
evil
interfere
with
the
happiness
of
two
people
situated
as
we
are
parsons
seemed
puzzled
at
first
as
though
he
did
not
understand
exactly
what
she
meant
but
when
she
concluded
he
said
you
come
to
me
as
you
have
yourself
stated
on
the
footing
of
a
daughter
if
folk
are
not
content
to
mind
their
own
business
i
guess
we
need
worry
because
they
do
happen
to
be
suited
there
one
or
two
relations
of
mine
would
be
glad
to
be
in
your
shoes
but
i
do
know
of
anything
in
the
bible
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
forbids
an
old
man
from
choosing
the
face
he
have
opposite
to
him
at
table
or
forbids
the
interchange
of
true
sympathy
that
priceless
privilege
answered
selma
her
liking
for
a
sententious
speech
rising
paramount
even
to
the
pleasure
caused
her
by
the
allusion
to
her
personal
appearance
nevertheless
it
was
agreeable
to
be
preferred
to
his
female
cousins
on
the
score
of
comeliness
accordingly
within
six
months
of
her
husband
death
the
transition
to
benham
was
accomplished
and
selma
was
able
to
encounter
the
metaphorically
open
arms
referred
to
by
earle
without
feeling
that
she
was
a
less
important
person
than
when
she
had
been
whisked
off
as
a
bride
by
littleton
the
rising
architect
she
was
returning
as
the
confidential
protecting
companion
of
a
successful
old
man
who
was
relying
on
her
to
make
his
new
establishment
a
pleasure
to
himself
and
a
credit
to
the
city
in
which
he
had
elected
to
pass
his
remaining
days
she
was
returning
to
a
house
on
the
river
drive
the
aristocratic
boulevard
of
benham
where
the
river
nye
makes
a
broad
sweep
to
the
south
a
house
not
far
distant
from
the
flagg
mansion
at
which
as
lewis
babcock
she
had
looked
askance
as
a
monument
inimical
to
democratic
simplicity
wilbur
had
taught
her
that
it
was
very
ugly
and
now
that
she
saw
it
again
after
a
lapse
of
years
she
was
pleased
to
note
that
her
new
residence
though
slightly
smaller
had
a
more
modern
and
distinguished
air
the
new
house
was
of
red
sandstone
combining
solid
dignity
and
some
artistic
merit
for
benham
had
not
stood
still
architecturally
speaking
the
river
drive
was
a
grotesque
yet
on
the
whole
encouraging
exhibit
most
of
the
residences
had
been
designed
by
native
talent
but
under
the
spur
of
experiment
even
the
plain
builders
had
been
constrained
to
dub
themselves
architects
and
adopt
modern
methods
and
here
and
there
stood
evidences
that
the
seed
planted
by
hallett
taylor
and
littleton
had
borne
fruit
for
benham
possessed
at
least
half
a
dozen
private
houses
which
could
defy
criticism
the
one
selected
by
parsons
was
not
of
these
half
dozen
but
the
plain
builder
who
had
erected
it
for
the
original
owner
was
shrewd
and
imitative
and
had
avoided
ambitious
deviations
from
the
type
he
wished
to
copy
the
red
sandstone
swell
front
variety
which
ten
years
before
would
have
seemed
to
the
moral
sense
of
benham
unduly
cheerful
parsons
was
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
buy
it
just
after
it
had
been
completed
together
with
a
stable
and
half
an
acre
of
ground
from
one
of
the
few
benhamites
whose
financial
ventures
had
ended
in
disaster
and
who
was
obliged
to
sell
it
was
a
more
ambitious
residence
than
parsons
had
desired
but
it
was
the
most
available
inasmuch
as
he
could
occupy
it
at
once
it
had
been
painted
and
decorated
within
but
was
unfurnished
parsons
as
a
practical
business
man
engaged
the
builder
to
select
and
supply
the
bedroom
and
solid
fittings
but
it
occurred
to
him
to
invite
selma
to
choose
the
furnishings
for
what
he
called
the
show
rooms
selma
was
delighted
to
visit
once
more
the
new
york
stores
free
from
the
bridle
of
wilbur
criticism
and
unrestrained
by
economy
she
found
to
her
satisfaction
that
the
internal
decoration
of
the
new
house
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
williamses
first
habitation
that
is
gay
and
bedizened
and
she
was
resolved
in
the
selection
of
her
draperies
and
ornaments
to
buy
things
which
suggested
by
their
looks
that
they
were
handsome
and
whose
claim
to
distinction
was
not
mere
sober
unobtrusiveness
she
realized
that
some
of
her
purchases
would
have
made
wilbur
squirm
but
since
his
death
she
felt
more
sure
than
ever
that
even
where
art
was
concerned
his
taste
was
subdued
timid
and
unimaginative
for
instance
she
believed
that
he
would
not
have
approved
her
choice
of
satin
for
the
upholstery
of
the
nor
of
a
marble
statue
an
allegorical
figure
of
truth
duly
draped
as
its
most
conspicuous
ornament
selma
was
spared
the
embarrassment
of
her
first
husband
presence
divorce
is
no
bar
to
ordinary
feminine
curiosity
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
a
former
partner
for
life
and
she
had
proved
no
exception
to
the
rule
earle
had
kept
her
posted
as
to
babcock
career
since
their
separation
and
what
she
learned
had
tended
merely
to
demonstrate
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
her
action
as
a
divorced
man
he
had
after
a
time
resumed
the
free
and
easy
coarse
companionship
to
which
he
had
been
partial
before
his
marriage
and
had
gradually
become
a
heavy
drinker
presently
he
had
neglected
his
business
a
misfortune
of
which
a
rival
concern
had
been
quick
to
take
advantage
the
trend
of
his
affairs
had
been
steadily
downhill
and
had
come
to
a
crisis
three
months
before
littleton
death
when
in
order
to
avoid
insolvency
he
sold
out
his
factory
and
business
to
the
rival
company
and
accepted
at
the
same
hands
the
position
of
manager
in
a
branch
office
in
a
city
further
west
consequently
selma
could
feel
free
from
molestation
or
an
appeal
to
her
sensibilities
she
preferred
to
think
of
babcock
as
completely
outside
her
life
as
dead
to
her
and
she
would
have
disliked
the
possibility
of
meeting
him
in
the
flesh
while
shopping
on
central
avenue
it
had
been
the
only
drawback
to
her
proposed
return
to
benham
during
the
years
of
selma
second
marriage
benham
had
waxed
rapidly
in
population
and
importance
people
had
been
attracted
thither
by
the
varied
industries
of
the
city
alike
those
in
search
of
fortune
and
those
offering
themselves
for
employment
in
the
mills
and
pork
factories
and
at
the
date
of
littleton
death
it
boasted
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
it
was
already
the
second
city
of
the
state
in
point
of
population
and
was
freely
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
and
enterprising
the
civic
spirit
of
benham
was
reputed
to
be
constantly
and
increasingly
alert
and
progressive
notwithstanding
the
river
nye
still
ran
the
color
of
above
where
it
was
drawn
for
drinking
purposes
and
the
ability
of
a
plumber
who
had
become
an
alderman
to
provide
a
statue
or
lay
out
a
public
park
was
still
unquestioned
by
the
majority
even
when
trained
ability
has
obtained
recognition
in
many
quarters
the
benhamites
at
large
are
apt
to
resent
criticism
as
aristocratic
yet
at
this
time
that
saving
minority
of
souls
who
refused
to
regard
everything
which
benham
did
as
perfection
and
whose
subsequent
forlorn
hopes
and
desperately
won
victories
have
little
by
little
taught
the
community
wisdom
if
not
modesty
was
beginning
to
utter
disagreeable
strictures
margaret
rodney
earle
when
she
opened
her
arms
to
selma
and
folded
her
to
her
bosom
with
a
hug
of
welcome
was
raging
inwardly
against
this
minority
and
they
had
not
been
many
minutes
together
before
she
gave
utterance
to
her
grievance
you
have
come
just
in
time
to
give
us
your
sympathy
and
support
in
an
important
matter
my
dear
miss
bailey
has
been
nominated
for
the
school
board
at
the
instance
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
benham
institute
we
supposed
that
she
would
have
plain
sailing
for
many
of
the
voters
have
begun
to
recognize
the
justice
of
having
one
or
two
women
on
the
school
board
and
by
hard
work
we
had
succeeded
in
getting
her
name
put
on
the
democratic
ticket
judge
then
of
our
feelings
when
we
learned
that
the
reform
club
had
decided
to
blacklist
and
refuse
to
support
at
the
polls
three
of
the
six
names
on
the
ticket
including
our
luella
bailey
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
experience
in
educational
matters
the
reform
club
has
nominated
three
other
persons
one
of
them
a
woman
and
who
do
you
suppose
is
the
head
and
front
of
this
unholy
crusade
it
sounds
like
hallett
taylor
answered
selma
sternly
how
did
you
know
what
made
you
think
so
how
clever
of
you
selma
yes
she
is
the
active
spirit
it
was
she
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
miss
bailey
rejection
when
she
was
my
candidate
for
a
position
at
everdean
college
to
be
sure
i
remember
this
reform
club
which
was
started
a
year
or
so
ago
and
which
sets
itself
up
as
a
censor
of
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
benham
has
nominated
a
miss
snow
who
is
said
to
have
travelled
abroad
studying
the
school
systems
of
europe
as
if
that
would
help
us
in
any
way
precisely
she
has
probably
come
home
with
her
head
full
of
notions
which
would
be
out
of
keeping
with
our
institutions
just
the
reason
why
she
should
be
chosen
we
are
greatly
troubled
as
to
the
result
dear
for
though
we
expect
to
win
the
prejudice
of
some
men
against
voting
for
a
woman
under
any
circumstances
will
operate
against
our
candidate
so
that
this
action
of
the
reform
club
may
possibly
be
the
means
of
electing
one
of
the
men
on
the
republican
ticket
instead
of
luella
miss
snow
has
the
ghost
of
a
chance
but
that
is
all
these
reform
club
nominations
are
preliminary
to
a
bill
before
the
legislature
to
take
away
from
the
people
the
right
to
elect
members
of
the
school
committee
and
substitute
an
appointive
board
of
specialists
to
serve
during
long
terms
of
good
behavior
as
lyons
says
that
the
real
issue
involved
it
quixotic
and
it
is
necessary
have
we
always
prided
ourselves
on
our
ability
to
keep
our
public
schools
the
best
in
the
world
and
is
there
any
doubt
selma
that
either
you
or
i
would
be
fully
qualified
to
serve
on
the
school
board
though
we
have
made
any
special
study
of
primers
and
geographies
luella
bailey
has
had
any
special
training
but
she
smart
and
progressive
and
the
poor
thing
would
like
the
recognition
we
fixed
on
her
because
we
thought
it
would
help
her
to
get
ahead
for
she
has
not
been
lucky
in
obtaining
suitable
employment
as
lyons
says
a
serious
principle
is
involved
he
has
come
out
strong
against
the
movement
and
declares
that
it
is
a
direct
menace
to
the
intelligence
of
the
plain
people
of
the
united
states
and
a
subtle
invasion
of
their
liberties
lyons
what
lyons
is
that
yes
dear
it
is
the
same
one
who
managed
your
affair
your
lyons
he
has
become
an
important
man
since
you
left
benham
he
speaks
delightfully
and
is
likely
to
receive
the
next
democratic
nomination
for
congress
he
is
in
accord
with
all
liberal
movements
and
a
foe
of
everything
exclusive
unchristian
or
arbitrary
he
has
declared
his
intention
to
oppose
the
bill
when
it
is
introduced
and
i
shall
devote
myself
body
and
soul
to
working
against
it
in
case
luella
bailey
is
defeated
it
is
awkward
because
taylor
is
a
member
of
the
institute
though
she
does
often
come
and
the
club
has
never
been
in
politics
but
here
when
there
was
a
chance
to
do
luella
bailey
a
good
turn
and
i
been
able
through
some
of
my
newspaper
friends
to
get
her
on
the
ticket
it
seems
to
me
positively
unchristian
yes
that
the
word
to
try
to
keep
her
off
the
board
there
are
some
things
of
course
luella
could
do
and
if
the
position
were
superintendent
of
a
hospital
for
instance
i
dare
say
that
special
training
would
be
advantageous
though
nursing
can
be
picked
up
very
rapidly
by
a
keen
intelligence
but
to
raise
such
objections
in
regard
to
a
candidate
for
the
school
board
seems
to
me
ridiculous
as
well
as
cruel
what
we
need
there
are
open
receptive
minds
free
from
fads
and
prejudice
progressive
enthusiastic
intellects
it
worries
me
to
see
the
institute
dragged
into
politics
but
it
is
my
duty
to
resist
this
undemocratic
movement
surely
exclaimed
selma
with
fire
i
am
thankful
i
have
come
in
time
to
help
you
i
understand
exactly
i
have
been
passing
through
just
such
experiences
in
new
york
encountering
and
being
rebuffed
by
just
such
people
as
those
who
belong
to
this
reform
club
my
husband
was
beginning
to
see
through
them
and
to
recognize
that
we
were
both
tied
hand
and
foot
by
their
narrowness
and
lack
of
enthusiasm
when
he
died
if
he
had
lived
we
would
have
moved
to
benham
shortly
in
order
to
escape
from
bondage
and
one
thing
is
certain
dear
earle
she
continued
with
intensity
we
must
not
permit
this
carping
spirit
of
hostility
to
original
and
spontaneous
effort
to
get
a
foothold
in
benham
we
must
crush
it
we
must
stamp
it
out
amen
my
dear
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
i
declare
you
would
be
very
effective
in
public
if
you
were
roused
yes
i
am
roused
and
i
am
willing
to
speak
in
public
if
it
becomes
necessary
in
order
to
keep
benham
uncontaminated
by
the
insidious
canker
of
exclusiveness
and
the
distrust
of
aspiring
souls
which
a
few
narrow
minds
choose
to
term
untrained
am
untrained
am
superficial
and
common
do
lack
the
appearance
and
behavior
of
a
lady
selma
accompanied
these
interrogatories
with
successive
waves
of
the
hand
as
though
she
were
branding
so
many
falsehoods
assuredly
not
selma
i
consider
you
and
here
earle
gasped
in
the
process
of
choosing
her
words
i
consider
you
one
of
our
best
trained
and
most
independent
minds
cultured
a
friend
of
culture
and
an
earnest
seeker
after
truth
if
you
are
not
a
lady
neither
am
i
neither
is
anyone
in
benham
why
do
you
ask
dear
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
earle
added
with
a
touch
of
material
wisdom
you
return
to
benham
under
satisfactory
i
might
say
brilliant
auspices
you
will
be
the
active
spirit
in
this
fine
house
and
be
in
a
position
to
promote
worthy
intellectual
and
moral
movements
thank
heavens
yes
and
to
combat
those
which
are
unworthy
and
dangerous
exclaimed
selma
clasping
her
fingers
i
can
count
on
the
support
of
parsons
god
bless
him
and
it
would
seem
at
last
as
if
i
had
a
real
chance
a
real
chance
at
last
earle
cora
i
know
you
can
keep
a
secret
i
feel
almost
as
though
you
were
my
mother
for
there
is
no
one
else
now
to
whom
i
can
talk
like
this
i
have
not
been
happy
in
new
york
i
thought
i
was
happy
at
first
but
lately
we
have
been
miserable
my
marriage
er
they
drove
my
husband
to
the
wall
and
killed
him
he
was
sensitive
and
noble
but
not
practical
and
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
mercenary
despotism
of
our
surroundings
when
i
tried
to
help
him
they
became
jealous
of
me
and
shut
their
doors
in
our
faces
you
poor
poor
child
i
have
suspected
for
some
time
that
something
was
wrong
it
nearly
killed
me
but
now
thank
heaven
i
breathe
freely
once
more
i
have
lost
my
dear
husband
but
i
have
escaped
from
that
and
with
his
memory
to
keep
me
merciless
i
am
eager
to
wage
war
against
those
influences
which
are
conspiring
to
fetter
the
soul
and
stifle
spontaneity
luella
bailey
must
be
elected
and
these
people
be
taught
that
foreign
ideas
may
flourish
in
new
york
but
can
not
obtain
root
in
benham
earle
wiped
her
eyes
which
were
running
over
as
the
result
of
this
combination
of
confidence
and
eloquence
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
selma
i
never
saw
anyone
so
much
improved
as
you
you
always
had
ideas
and
were
well
equipped
but
now
you
speak
as
though
you
could
remove
mountains
if
necessary
it
a
blessing
for
us
as
well
as
you
that
you
back
among
us
once
more
chapter
ii
when
selma
uttered
her
edict
that
luella
bailey
must
be
elected
she
did
not
know
that
the
election
was
only
three
days
off
when
she
was
told
this
by
earle
she
cast
about
feverishly
during
a
few
hours
for
the
means
to
compass
certain
victory
then
promptly
and
sensibly
disclaimed
responsibility
for
the
result
suggesting
even
that
her
first
appearance
as
a
remover
of
mountains
be
deferred
to
the
time
when
the
bill
should
be
before
the
legislature
as
she
aptly
explained
to
earle
the
canvass
was
virtually
at
an
end
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
practical
features
of
the
situation
and
was
to
all
intents
a
stranger
in
benham
after
so
long
an
absence
earle
was
unable
to
combat
the
logic
of
these
representations
but
she
obtained
from
selma
a
ready
promise
to
accompany
the
benham
institute
to
the
final
rally
on
the
evening
before
election
day
and
sit
in
a
prominent
place
on
the
platform
the
institute
was
to
attend
as
a
body
by
way
of
promoting
the
cause
of
its
candidate
for
though
the
meeting
was
called
in
aid
of
the
entire
democratic
municipal
ticket
hon
james
lyons
the
leading
orator
of
the
occasion
had
promised
to
devote
special
attention
to
miss
bailey
whose
election
owing
to
the
attitude
of
the
reform
club
was
recognized
as
in
doubt
selma
also
agreed
to
accompany
earle
in
a
hack
on
the
day
itself
and
career
through
the
city
in
search
of
recalcitrant
or
indifferent
female
voters
for
the
recently
acquired
right
of
benham
women
to
vote
for
members
of
the
school
board
had
not
as
yet
been
exercised
by
any
considerable
number
of
the
emancipated
sex
as
a
part
of
the
programme
of
the
meeting
the
benham
institute
or
the
major
portion
of
it
for
there
were
a
few
who
sympathized
openly
with
taylor
filed
showily
on
to
the
platform
headed
by
earle
who
waved
her
pocket
handkerchief
at
the
audience
which
was
the
occasion
for
renewed
and
enthusiasm
selma
walked
not
far
behind
and
took
her
seat
among
the
forty
other
members
who
all
wore
white
silk
badges
stamped
in
red
with
the
sentiment
a
vote
for
luella
bailey
is
a
vote
for
the
liberty
of
the
people
her
pulses
were
throbbing
with
interest
and
pleasure
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
delighted
in
and
which
she
had
hoped
would
be
a
frequent
incident
of
her
life
in
new
york
it
pleased
her
to
think
how
naturally
and
easily
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
ranks
of
these
earnest
enthusiastic
workers
and
that
she
had
merely
to
express
a
wish
in
order
to
have
leadership
urged
upon
her
matters
had
shaped
themselves
exactly
as
she
desired
parsons
not
only
treated
her
completely
as
an
equal
but
consulted
her
in
regard
to
everything
he
had
already
become
obviously
dependent
on
her
and
had
begun
to
develop
the
tendencies
of
an
invalid
the
exercises
were
of
a
partisan
cast
the
theory
that
municipal
government
should
be
independent
of
party
politics
had
been
an
adage
in
benham
since
its
foundation
and
been
disregarded
annually
by
of
the
population
ever
since
this
was
a
democratic
the
speakers
and
the
audience
alike
were
in
the
best
of
spirits
for
there
was
no
uncertainty
in
the
minds
of
the
party
prophets
as
to
the
result
of
the
morrow
ballot
excepting
with
regard
to
miss
bailey
the
rest
of
the
ticket
would
unquestionably
be
elected
accordingly
all
hands
and
voices
were
free
to
focus
their
energies
in
her
behalf
and
thus
make
the
victory
a
clean
sweep
nevertheless
the
earlier
speakers
felt
obliged
to
let
their
eloquence
flow
over
the
whole
range
of
political
misgovernment
from
the
white
house
and
the
national
platform
down
although
the
actual
issue
was
the
choice
of
a
mayor
twelve
aldermen
and
a
school
committee
so
that
only
casual
reference
was
made
to
the
single
weak
spot
on
the
ticket
until
the
hon
james
lyons
rose
to
address
the
meeting
the
reception
accorded
him
was
more
spontaneous
and
effusive
than
that
which
had
been
bestowed
on
either
of
his
predecessors
and
as
he
stood
waiting
with
dignified
urbanity
for
the
applause
to
subside
some
rapturous
admirer
called
for
three
cheers
and
the
tumult
was
renewed
selma
was
thrilled
her
acquaintance
with
lyons
naturally
heightened
her
interest
and
she
observed
him
eagerly
time
had
added
to
his
corporeal
weight
since
he
had
acted
as
her
counsel
and
enhanced
the
sober
yet
genial
decorum
of
his
bearing
his
slightly
pontifical
air
seemed
an
assurance
against
levity
his
cheeks
were
still
fat
and
smooth
shaven
but
like
many
of
the
successful
men
of
benham
he
now
wore
a
chin
beard
a
thick
tuft
of
hair
which
in
his
case
tapered
so
that
it
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
beard
of
a
goat
and
gave
a
aspect
to
his
appearance
suggestive
alike
of
smart
solid
worth
and
an
absence
of
dandified
tendencies
parsons
had
a
thicker
beard
of
the
same
character
which
selma
regarded
with
favor
as
a
badge
of
serious
intentions
my
friends
he
began
when
the
applause
had
subsided
then
paused
and
surveyed
his
audience
in
a
manner
which
left
them
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
was
struggling
with
emotion
or
busy
in
silent
prayer
my
friends
a
month
ago
the
citizens
of
benham
assembled
to
crown
with
appropriate
and
beautiful
services
the
monument
which
they
the
survivors
have
erected
with
pious
hands
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
those
who
laid
down
their
lives
to
keep
intact
our
beloved
union
of
states
and
to
banish
slavery
forever
from
the
confines
of
our
aspiring
civilization
a
week
ago
an
equally
representative
assembly
without
regard
to
creed
or
party
listened
to
the
exercises
attending
the
dedication
of
the
new
court
house
which
we
have
raised
to
justice
that
goddess
the
guardian
of
the
liberties
of
the
people
each
was
a
notable
and
significant
event
on
each
occasion
i
had
the
honor
to
say
a
few
poor
words
we
celebrated
with
bowed
heads
and
with
garlands
the
deeds
of
the
heroic
dead
and
now
have
consecrated
ourselves
to
the
opportunities
and
possibilities
of
peace
under
the
law
to
the
revelation
of
the
temper
of
our
new
civilization
which
tried
in
the
furnace
of
war
is
to
be
a
grand
and
vital
power
for
the
advancement
of
the
human
race
for
the
righteous
furtherance
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
what
is
the
hope
of
the
world
he
asked
america
these
united
states
a
bulwark
against
tyranny
an
asylum
for
the
aspiring
and
the
downtrodden
the
eyes
of
the
nations
are
upon
us
in
the
souls
of
the
survivors
and
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
patriots
who
have
died
in
defence
of
the
liberties
of
our
beloved
country

the
seed
and
inspiration
for
new
victories
of
peace
our
privilege
be
it
as
the
heirs
of
washington
and
franklin
and
hamilton
and
lincoln
and
grant
to
set
the
nations
of
the
earth
an
example
of
what
peace
under
the
law
may
accomplish
so
that
the
son
of
america
from
the
shores
of
cape
cod
to
the
western
limits
of
the
golden
gate
may
remain
a
synonym
for
noble
aims
and
noble
deeds
for
truth
and
patriotism
and
fearlessness
of
soul
the
speaker
words
had
been
uttered
slowly
at
the
outset
ponderous
sonorous
sentence
by
sentence
like
the
big
drops
before
a
heavy
shower
as
he
warmed
to
his
theme
the
pauses
ceased
and
his
speech
flowed
with
the
musical
sweep
of
a
master
of
platform
oratory
when
he
spoke
of
war
his
voice
choked
in
speaking
of
peace
he
paused
for
an
appreciable
moment
casting
his
eyes
up
as
though
he
could
discern
the
angel
of
national
tranquillity
hovering
overhead
although
this
opening
peroration
seemed
scarcely
germane
to
the
occasion
the
audience
listened
in
absorbed
silence
by
the
magnetism
of
his
delivery
they
felt
sure
that
he
had
a
point
in
reserve
to
which
these
splendid
and
agreeable
truths
were
a
pertinent
introduction
proceeding
with
his
address
lyons
made
a
panegyric
on
these
united
states
of
america
from
the
special
standpoint
of
their
dedication
to
the
god
of
our
fathers
a
solemn
figure
of
speech
the
sincerity
of
his
patriotism
was
emphasized
by
the
religious
fervor
of
his
deduction
that
god
was
on
the
side
of
the
nation
and
the
nation
on
the
side
of
god
though
he
abstained
from
direct
strictures
both
his
manner
and
his
matter
seemed
to
serve
a
caveat
so
to
speak
on
the
other
nations
by
declaring
that
for
fineness
of
heart
and
thought
and
deed
the
world
must
look
to
the
land
whose
wide
and
boundless
prairies
were
blossoming
with
the
buds
of
truth
fanned
by
the
breeze
of
liberty
and
fertilized
by
the
aspirations
of
a
and
a
population
what
is
the
hope
of
the
world
i
repeat
he
continued
the
plain
and
sovereign
people
of
our
beloved
country
whatever
menaces
their
liberties
whatever
detracts
from
their
power
and
infringes
on
their
prerogatives
is
a
peril
to
our
institutions
and
a
step
backward
in
the
science
of
government
my
friends
we
are
here
to
protest
against
a
purpose
to
invade
those
liberties
a
deliberately
conceived
design
to
take
away
from
the
sovereign
people
of
this
city
one
of
their
cherished
privileges
the
right
to
decide
who
shall
direct
the
policy
of
our
free
system
that
priceless
heritage
of
every
american
i
beg
to
remind
you
that
this
contest
is
no
mere
question
of
healthy
rivalry
between
two
great
political
parties
nor
again
is
it
only
a
vigorous
competition
between
two
ambitious
and
intelligent
women
a
ballot
in
behalf
of
our
candidate
will
be
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
plain
people
of
this
country
to
adopt
the
best
educational
methods
without
the
patronizing
dictation
of
aboard
of
specialists
nurtured
on
foreign
and
uninspiring
theories
of
instruction
a
ballot
against
miss
luella
bailey
the
competent
and
cultivated
lady
whose
name
adds
strength
and
distinction
to
our
ticket
and
who
has
been
needlessly
and
wantonly
opposed
by
those
who
should
be
her
proud
friends
will
signify
a
willingness
to
renounce
one
of
our
most
precious
liberties
the
free
man
right
to
choose
those
who
are
to
impart
to
his
children
mastery
of
knowledge
and
love
of
country
i
take
my
stand
as
the
resolute
enemy
of
this
aristocratic
and
suggestion
and
urge
you
on
the
eve
of
election
to
devote
your
energies
to
overwhelming
beneath
the
shower
of
your
fearless
ballots
this
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
the
voters
of
benham
and
this
menace
to
our
free
and
successful
institutions
which
under
the
guidance
of
the
god
of
our
fathers
we
purpose
to
keep
perpetually
progressive
and
undefiled
a
salvo
of
enthusiasm
greeted
lyons
as
he
concluded
his
speeches
were
apt
to
cause
those
whom
he
addressed
to
feel
that
they
were
no
common
campaign
utterances
but
eloquent
expressions
of
principle
and
conviction
clothed
in
memorable
language
as
indeed
they
were
he
was
fond
of
giving
a
moral
or
patriotic
flavor
to
what
he
said
in
public
for
he
entertained
both
a
profound
reverence
for
high
moral
ideas
and
an
abiding
faith
in
the
superiority
of
everything
american
he
had
arrayed
himself
on
the
threshold
of
his
legal
career
as
a
friend
and
champion
of
the
mass
of
the
people
the
plain
and
sovereign
people
as
he
was
apt
to
style
them
in
public
his
first
and
considerable
successes
had
been
as
the
counsel
for
plaintiffs
before
juries
in
accident
cases
against
large
corporations
and
he
had
thought
of
himself
with
complete
sincerity
as
a
plain
man
contesting
for
human
rights
before
the
bar
of
justice
by
the
sheer
might
of
his
sonorous
voice
and
diligent
brain
his
political
development
had
been
on
the
same
side
latterly
the
situation
had
become
a
little
puzzling
though
to
a
man
of
straightforward
intentions
like
himself
not
fundamentally
embarrassing
that
is
the
last
four
or
five
years
had
altered
both
the
character
of
his
practice
and
his
circumstances
so
that
instead
of
fighting
corporations
he
was
now
the
close
adviser
of
a
score
of
them
not
the
defender
of
their
accident
cases
but
the
confidential
attorney
who
was
consulted
in
regard
to
their
vital
interests
and
who
charged
them
liberal
sums
for
his
services
he
still
figured
in
court
from
time
to
time
in
his
capacity
of
the
plain
man
friend
which
he
still
considered
himself
to
be
no
less
than
before
but
most
of
his
time
was
devoted
to
protecting
the
legal
interests
of
the
railroad
gas
water
manufacturing
mining
and
other
undertakings
which
the
rapid
growth
of
benham
had
forgotten
and
as
a
result
of
this
commerce
with
the
leading
men
of
affairs
in
benham
and
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
he
had
been
able
to
invest
his
large
fees
to
the
best
advantage
and
had
already
reaped
a
rich
harvest
from
the
rapid
rise
in
value
of
the
securities
of
diverse
successful
enterprises
when
new
projects
were
under
consideration
he
was
in
a
position
to
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
and
he
was
able
to
borrow
freely
from
a
local
bank
in
which
he
was
a
director
he
was
puzzled
it
might
be
said
distressed
how
to
make
these
rewards
of
his
professional
prominence
appear
compatible
with
his
real
political
principles
so
that
the
plain
and
sovereign
people
would
recognize
as
clearly
as
he
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
in
his
having
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunities
for
professional
advancement
thrown
in
his
way
he
was
ambitious
for
political
preferment
sharing
the
growing
impression
that
he
was
well
qualified
for
public
office
and
he
desired
to
rise
as
the
champion
of
popular
ideas
consequently
he
resented
bitterly
the
calumnies
which
had
appeared
in
one
or
two
irresponsible
newspapers
to
the
effect
that
he
was
becoming
a
corporation
attorney
and
a
capitalist
could
a
man
refuse
legitimate
business
which
was
thrust
upon
him
how
were
his
convictions
and
interest
in
the
cause
of
struggling
humanity
altered
or
affected
by
his
success
at
the
bar
hence
he
neglected
no
occasion
to
declare
his
allegiance
to
progressive
doctrine
and
to
give
utterance
to
the
patriotism
which
at
all
times
was
on
tap
in
his
emotional
system
he
had
been
married
but
his
wife
had
been
dead
a
number
of
years
and
he
made
his
home
with
his
aged
mother
to
whom
he
was
apt
to
refer
with
pious
tremulousness
when
he
desired
to
emphasize
some
domestic
situation
before
a
jury
as
a
staunch
member
of
the
methodist
church
he
was
on
terms
of
intimate
association
with
his
pastor
and
was
known
as
a
liberal
contributor
to
domestic
and
foreign
missions
selma
was
genuinely
carried
away
by
the
character
of
his
oratory
his
sentiments
were
so
completely
in
accord
with
her
own
ideas
that
she
felt
he
had
left
nothing
unsaid
and
had
put
the
case
grandly
here
at
last
was
a
man
who
shared
with
her
the
convictions
with
which
her
brain
was
seething
a
man
who
was
not
afraid
to
give
public
expression
to
his
views
and
who
possessed
a
splendid
gift
of
statement
she
had
felt
sure
that
she
would
meet
sympathy
and
kindred
spirits
in
benham
but
her
experience
in
new
york
had
so
far
depressed
her
that
she
had
not
allowed
herself
to
expect
such
a
champion
what
a
contrast
his
solid
devotional
yet
aspect
was
to
the
quizzical
lightness
of
the
men
in
new
york
she
had
been
told
were
clever
like
dr
page
and
dennison
he
possessed
wilbur
ardor
and
reverence
with
a
robustness
of
physique
and
a
practical
air
which
wilbur
had
lacked
lacked
to
his
and
her
detriment
if
wilbur
had
been
as
vigorous
in
body
as
he
ought
to
have
been
would
he
have
died
she
had
read
somewhere
lately
that
physical
delicacy
was
apt
to
react
on
the
mind
and
make
one
ideas
too
and
unsubstantial
here
was
the
advantage
which
a
man
like
lyons
had
over
wilbur
he
was
strong
and
thickset
and
looked
as
though
he
could
endure
hard
work
without
wincing
so
could
she
it
was
a
great
boon
an
essential
of
effective
manhood
or
womanhood
these
thoughts
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
enthusiasm
his
personality
had
aroused
in
her
at
the
close
of
his
address
she
scarcely
heard
the
remarks
of
the
next
speaker
the
last
on
the
programme
her
eyes
kept
straying
wistfully
in
the
direction
of
lyons
and
she
wondered
if
there
would
be
an
opportunity
when
the
meeting
was
over
to
let
him
know
how
much
she
approved
of
what
he
had
said
and
how
necessary
she
felt
the
promulgation
of
such
ideas
was
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
she
was
aroused
from
contemplation
by
the
voice
of
earle
who
now
that
everybody
was
standing
up
preliminary
to
departure
bent
over
her
front
bench
on
the
platform
to
whisper
was
lyons
splendid
yes
indeed
said
selma
i
should
like
so
much
to
make
his
acquaintance
to
compare
notes
with
him
and
thank
him
for
his
brave
true
words
i
know
he
be
pleased
to
meet
you
i
try
to
catch
his
eye
i
wish
some
of
those
reform
club
people
could
have
heard
what
he
thought
of
them
there
he
looking
this
way
i
going
to
attract
his
attention
whereupon
earle
began
to
nod
in
his
direction
energetically
he
sees
us
now
and
has
noticed
you
i
should
wonder
if
he
has
recognized
you
follow
me
close
selma
and
we
be
able
to
shake
hands
with
him
by
dint
of
squeezing
and
stertorous
declarations
of
her
desire
earle
obtained
a
gradual
passage
through
the
crowd
many
from
the
audience
had
ascended
to
the
platform
for
the
purpose
of
accosting
the
speakers
and
a
large
share
of
the
interest
was
being
bestowed
on
lyons
who
was
holding
an
impromptu
reception
when
at
last
earle
had
worked
her
way
to
within
a
few
feet
of
him
her
wheezing
condition
and
bulk
announced
her
approach
and
procured
her
consideration
from
the
others
in
the
line
so
that
she
was
able
to
plant
herself
pervasively
and
firmly
in
front
of
her
idol
and
take
possession
of
him
by
the
fervid
announcement
you
were
simply
unanswerable
eloquent
convincing
and
unanswerable
and
i
have
brought
with
me
an
old
friend
littleton
who
sympathizes
with
your
superb
utterances
and
wishes
to
tell
you
so
as
selma
stepped
forward
in
recognition
of
this
introduction
she
vibrated
to
hear
lyons
say
without
a
sign
of
hesitation
a
friend
whom
it
is
a
pleasure
to
welcome
back
to
benham
littleton
i
am
pleased
to
meet
you
again
selma
had
hoped
and
felt
it
her
due
that
he
would
recognize
her
still
his
having
done
so
at
once
was
a
compliment
which
served
to
enhance
the
favorable
opinion
which
she
had
already
formed
regarding
him
i
have
been
longing
for
months
lyons
she
said
to
hear
someone
say
what
you
have
said
i
am
concerned
as
we
all
are
of
course
in
miss
bailey
election
and
your
advocacy
of
her
cause
was
most
brilliant
but
what
i
refer
to
what
interested
me
especially
was
the
splendid
protest
you
uttered
against
all
movements
to
prevent
the
intelligence
of
the
people
from
asserting
itself
it
gave
me
encouragement
and
made
me
feel
that
the
outlook
for
the
future
is
bright
that
our
truths
must
prevail
it
was
a
maxim
with
lyons
that
it
was
desirable
to
remember
everyone
he
met
and
he
prided
himself
on
his
ability
to
call
cordially
by
name
clients
or
chance
acquaintances
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
nature
had
endowed
him
with
a
good
memory
for
names
and
faces
but
he
had
learned
to
take
advantage
of
all
opportunities
to
brush
up
his
wits
before
they
were
called
into
flattering
spontaneous
action
when
his
glance
attracted
by
earle
remote
gesticulation
rested
on
selma
face
he
began
to
ask
himself
at
once
where
he
had
seen
it
before
in
the
interval
vouchsafed
by
her
approach
he
recalled
the
incident
of
the
divorce
that
her
name
had
been
babcock
and
that
she
had
married
again
but
he
was
still
groping
for
the
name
of
her
husband
when
the
necessary
clew
was
supplied
by
earle
and
he
was
able
to
make
his
recognition
of
her
exhaustive
he
noticed
with
approval
her
pretty
face
and
compact
figure
reflecting
that
the
slight
gain
in
flesh
was
to
her
advantage
and
noticed
also
her
widow
mourning
but
her
eager
fluent
address
and
zealous
manner
had
prevented
his
attention
from
secretly
wandering
with
foresight
to
the
next
persons
in
the
line
of
those
anxious
to
shake
his
hand
and
led
him
to
regard
her
a
second
time
he
was
accustomed
to
compliments
but
he
was
struck
by
the
note
of
discriminating
companionship
in
her
congratulation
he
believed
that
he
had
much
at
heart
the
very
issue
which
she
had
touched
upon
and
it
gratified
him
that
a
woman
whose
appearance
was
so
attractive
to
him
should
single
out
for
sympathetic
enthusiasm
what
was
in
his
opinion
the
cardinal
principle
involved
instead
of
expatiating
on
the
assistance
he
had
rendered
miss
bailey
lyons
said
to
himself
that
here
was
a
kindred
spirit
a
woman
with
whom
conversation
would
be
a
pleasure
with
whom
it
would
be
possible
to
discourse
on
terms
of
mental
comradeship
he
was
partial
to
comely
women
but
he
did
not
approve
of
frivolity
except
on
special
and
guarded
occasions
i
thank
you
cordially
for
your
appreciation
he
answered
you
have
grasped
the
vital
kernel
of
my
speech
and
i
am
grateful
for
your
good
opinion
even
in
addressing
the
other
sex
lyons
could
not
forget
the
responsibility
of
his
and
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
be
strictly
serious
in
public
nevertheless
his
august
but
glib
demeanor
suited
selma
mood
better
than
more
obvious
gallantry
especially
as
she
got
the
impression
which
he
really
wished
to
convey
that
he
admired
her
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
prolong
the
situation
in
the
face
of
those
waiting
to
grasp
his
hand
but
lyons
heard
with
interest
the
statement
which
earle
managed
to
whisper
hoarsely
in
his
ear
just
as
he
turned
to
welcome
the
next
comer
and
they
were
swept
along
she
is
one
of
our
brightest
minds
the
poor
child
has
recently
lost
her
husband
and
has
come
to
keep
parsons
company
in
his
new
house
an
ideal
arrangement
the
identity
of
parsons
was
well
known
to
lyons
he
had
met
him
occasionally
in
the
past
in
other
parts
of
the
state
in
connection
with
business
complications
and
regarded
him
as
a
practical
intelligent
citizen
whose
name
would
be
of
value
to
an
aspirant
for
congressional
honors
it
occurred
to
him
as
he
shook
hands
with
those
next
in
line
and
addressed
them
that
it
would
be
eminently
suitable
if
he
should
pay
his
respects
to
this
to
benham
by
a
visit
by
so
doing
he
world
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
for
he
had
reasoned
of
late
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
see
more
of
the
other
sex
he
had
no
specific
matrimonial
intentions
that
is
he
was
not
on
the
lookout
for
a
wife
but
he
approved
of
happy
unions
as
one
of
the
great
bulwarks
of
the
community
and
was
to
encounter
a
suitable
helpmate
he
should
expect
physical
charms
dignity
capacity
and
a
sympathetic
mind
a
woman
in
short
who
would
be
an
ornament
to
his
home
a
christian
influence
in
society
and
a
companion
whose
intelligent
tact
would
be
likely
to
promote
his
political
fortunes
and
so
it
happened
that
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
he
found
himself
thinking
of
littleton
as
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
this
had
not
happened
to
him
before
since
the
death
of
his
wife
and
it
made
him
thoughtful
to
the
extent
of
asking
why
not
for
in
spite
of
his
long
and
proper
demeanor
passion
was
not
extinct
in
the
bosom
of
the
hon
james
lyons
and
he
was
capable
on
special
and
guarded
occasions
of
telling
a
woman
that
he
loved
her
chapter
iii
miss
luella
bailey
was
not
elected
the
unenlightened
prejudice
of
man
to
prefer
one
of
his
own
sex
combined
with
the
hostility
of
the
reform
club
procured
her
defeat
notwithstanding
that
the
rest
of
her
ticket
triumphed
at
the
polls
there
was
some
consolation
for
her
friends
in
the
fact
that
her
rival
miss
snow
had
a
considerably
smaller
number
of
votes
than
she
selma
solaced
herself
by
the
reflection
that
as
she
had
been
consulted
only
at
the
twelfth
hour
she
was
not
responsible
for
the
result
but
she
felt
nerved
by
the
defeat
to
concentrate
her
energies
against
the
proposed
bill
for
an
appointed
school
board
her
immediate
attention
and
sympathy
were
suddenly
invoked
by
the
illness
of
parsons
who
had
seemed
lacking
in
physical
vigor
for
some
weeks
and
whose
symptoms
culminated
in
a
slight
paralysis
which
confined
him
to
his
bed
for
a
month
and
to
his
house
during
the
remainder
of
the
autumn
selma
rejoiced
in
this
opportunity
to
develop
her
capacities
as
a
nurse
to
prove
how
adequate
she
would
have
been
to
take
complete
charge
of
her
late
husband
had
dr
page
chosen
to
trust
her
she
administered
with
scrupulous
regularity
to
the
invalid
such
medicines
as
were
ordered
and
kept
him
cheerful
by
reading
and
conversation
so
that
the
physician
in
charge
complimented
her
on
her
proficiency
trained
nurses
were
unknown
in
benham
at
this
time
and
any
old
or
unoccupied
female
was
regarded
as
qualified
to
watch
over
the
sick
selma
appreciated
from
what
she
had
observed
of
the
conduct
of
wilbur
nurse
that
there
was
a
wrong
and
a
right
way
of
doing
things
but
she
blamed
dr
page
for
his
failure
to
appreciate
instinctively
that
she
was
sure
to
do
things
suitably
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
lacked
the
intuitive
gift
to
discern
latent
capabilities
a
fault
of
which
the
benham
practitioner
proved
blameless
from
the
large
sunny
chamber
in
which
parsons
slowly
recovered
some
portion
of
his
vitality
selma
could
discern
the
distant
beginnings
of
wetmore
college
pleasantly
situated
on
an
elevation
well
beyond
the
city
limits
on
the
further
side
of
the
winding
river
an
architect
had
been
engaged
to
carry
out
wilbur
plans
and
she
watched
the
outlines
of
the
new
building
gradually
take
shape
during
the
convalescence
of
her
benefactor
she
recognized
that
the
college
would
be
theoretically
a
noble
addition
to
the
standing
of
benham
as
a
city
of
intellectual
and
æsthetic
interests
but
it
provoked
her
to
think
that
its
management
was
in
the
hands
of
hallett
taylor
and
her
friends
between
whom
and
herself
she
felt
that
a
chasm
of
irreconcilable
differences
of
opinion
existed
taylor
had
not
called
on
her
since
her
return
she
believed
that
she
was
glad
of
this
and
hoped
that
some
of
the
severely
indignant
criticism
which
she
had
uttered
in
regard
to
the
reform
club
movement
had
reached
her
ears
or
was
taylor
envious
of
her
return
to
benham
as
the
true
mistress
of
this
fine
establishment
on
the
river
drive
so
superior
to
her
own
nevertheless
it
would
have
suited
selma
to
have
been
one
of
the
trustees
of
this
new
college
her
handiwork
in
the
doing
of
which
he
had
laid
down
his
promising
life
and
the
fact
that
no
one
had
sought
her
out
and
offered
her
the
honor
as
a
fitting
recognition
of
her
due
was
secretly
mortifying
the
benham
institute
had
been
prompt
to
acknowledge
her
presence
by
giving
a
reception
in
her
honor
at
which
she
was
able
to
recite
once
more
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
with
success
and
she
had
been
informed
by
earle
that
she
was
likely
to
be
chosen
one
of
the
at
the
annual
meeting
but
these
reform
club
people
had
not
even
done
her
the
courtesy
to
ask
her
to
join
them
or
consider
their
opinions
she
would
have
spurned
the
invitation
with
contempt
but
it
piqued
her
not
to
know
more
about
them
it
distressed
her
to
think
that
there
should
exist
in
benham
an
exclusive
set
which
professed
to
be
ethically
and
intellectually
superior
and
did
not
include
her
for
she
had
come
to
benham
with
the
intention
of
leading
such
a
movement
to
the
detriment
of
fashion
and
frivolity
with
parsons
money
at
her
back
she
was
serenely
confident
that
the
houses
of
the
magnates
of
benham
the
people
who
corresponded
in
her
mind
eye
to
the
dwellers
on
fifth
avenue
would
open
to
her
already
there
had
been
flattering
indications
that
she
would
be
able
to
command
attention
there
she
had
expected
to
find
this
so
her
heart
would
have
been
broken
to
find
it
otherwise
still
her
hope
in
shaking
the
dust
of
new
york
from
her
feet
had
been
to
find
in
benham
an
equally
admirable
and
satisfactory
atmosphere
in
regard
to
mental
and
moral
progress
she
had
come
just
in
time
it
is
true
to
utter
her
vehement
protest
against
this
exclusive
aristocratic
movement
this
arrogant
affectation
of
superiority
and
to
array
herself
in
battle
line
against
it
resolved
to
give
herself
up
with
enthusiasm
to
its
annihilation
yet
the
sight
of
the
college
buildings
for
the
higher
education
of
women
rising
without
her
furtherance
and
supervision
and
under
the
direction
of
these
people
made
her
sad
and
gave
her
a
feeling
of
disappointment
why
had
they
been
permitted
to
obtain
this
foothold
someone
had
been
lacking
in
vigilance
and
foresight
thank
heaven
with
her
return
and
a
strong
popular
spirit
like
lyons
in
the
lead
these
unsympathetic
reformers
would
speedily
be
confounded
and
the
intellectual
air
of
benham
restored
to
its
original
purity
one
afternoon
while
selma
gaze
happened
to
be
directed
toward
the
embryo
college
walls
and
she
was
incubating
on
the
situation
parsons
who
had
seemed
to
be
dozing
suddenly
said
i
should
like
you
to
write
to
lyons
the
lawyer
and
ask
him
to
come
to
see
me
i
will
write
you
know
he
called
while
you
were
yes
i
thought
him
a
clever
fellow
when
we
met
two
or
three
times
on
railroad
matters
and
i
gather
from
what
you
told
me
about
his
speech
at
the
political
meeting
that
he
a
rising
man
hereabouts
i
going
to
make
my
will
and
i
need
him
to
put
it
into
proper
shape
i
sure
he
do
it
correctly
there
not
much
for
him
to
do
except
to
make
sure
that
the
language
is
legal
for
i
thought
it
all
out
while
i
been
lying
here
during
these
weeks
still
it
important
to
have
in
a
lawyer
to
fix
it
so
the
people
whom
i
do
intend
to
get
my
money
sha
be
able
to
make
out
that
i
not
in
my
right
mind
i
guess
he
added
with
a
laugh
that
the
doctor
will
allow
i
my
wits
sufficiently
for
that
surely
you
are
practically
well
now
parsons
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
prided
himself
on
being
about
his
private
affairs
until
they
were
ripe
for
utterance
his
intention
had
been
to
defer
until
after
the
interview
with
his
lawyer
any
statement
of
his
purpose
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
please
him
to
unbosom
his
secret
to
his
companion
because
he
felt
sure
in
advance
that
she
would
sympathize
fully
with
his
plans
he
had
meant
to
tell
her
when
the
instrument
was
signed
why
not
now
selma
he
said
i
known
ever
since
my
wife
and
daughter
died
that
i
ought
to
make
a
will
but
i
kept
putting
it
off
until
it
has
almost
happened
that
everything
i
got
went
to
my
next
of
kin
folk
i
fond
of
too
and
mean
to
remember
but
not
fond
enough
for
that
if
i
give
them
fifty
thousand
dollars
apiece
the
three
of
them
i
shall
rest
easy
in
my
grave
even
if
they
think
they
ought
to
have
had
a
bigger
slice
it
hard
on
a
man
who
has
worked
all
his
days
and
laid
up
close
to
a
million
of
dollars
not
to
have
a
son
or
a
daughter
flesh
of
my
flesh
to
leave
it
to
a
boy
or
a
girl
given
at
the
start
the
education
i
did
get
and
who
by
the
help
of
my
money
might
make
me
proud
if
i
could
look
on
of
my
name
or
my
blood
it
was
to
be
and
i
must
grin
and
bear
it
and
do
the
next
best
thing
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
that
thing
was
soon
after
i
lost
my
wife
and
daughter
and
it
was
the
thought
of
that
more
than
anything
which
kept
me
from
going
crazy
with
despair
i
a
plain
man
an
uneducated
man
but
the
fortune
i
made
has
been
made
honestly
and
i
going
to
spend
it
for
the
good
of
the
american
people
to
contribute
my
mite
toward
helping
the
cause
of
truth
and
good
citizenship
and
free
and
independent
ideas
which
this
nation
calls
for
i
going
to
give
my
money
for
benevolent
uses
oh
parsons
exclaimed
selma
clasping
her
hands
how
splendid
how
glorious
how
i
envy
you
it
was
what
i
hoped
i
knew
you
would
be
pleased
i
had
half
a
mind
once
or
twice
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
because
i
guessed
it
would
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
take
your
fancy
but
somehow
i
kept
mum
for
fear
i
might
be
taken
before
i
been
able
to
make
a
will
and
then
too
i
been
of
several
minds
as
to
the
form
of
my
gift
i
thought
it
would
suit
me
best
of
all
to
found
a
college
and
i
was
disappointed
when
i
learned
that
neighbor
flagg
had
got
the
start
of
me
with
his
seminary
for
women
across
the
river
i
was
happy
over
it
until
one
night
just
after
the
doctor
had
gone
the
thought
came
to
me
not
give
a
hospital
and
that
what
it
to
be
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
a
free
hospital
in
the
city
of
benham
in
memory
of
my
wife
and
daughter
that
be
useful
wo
it
that
help
the
people
as
much
as
a
college
and
selma
he
added
cutting
off
the
assuring
answer
which
trembled
on
her
tongue
and
blazed
from
her
eyes
i
sha
forget
you
after
i
gone
you
are
to
have
twenty
thousand
dollars
that
enable
you
in
case
you
do
marry
to
keep
a
roof
over
your
head
without
working
too
hard
thank
you
you
are
very
generous
she
said
the
announcement
was
pleasant
to
her
but
at
the
moment
it
seemed
of
secondary
importance
her
enthusiasm
had
been
aroused
by
the
fact
and
character
of
his
public
donation
and
already
her
brain
was
dancing
with
the
thought
of
the
prospect
of
a
rival
vital
institution
in
connection
with
which
her
views
and
her
talents
would
in
all
probability
be
consulted
and
allowed
to
exercise
themselves
her
and
not
taylor
or
any
of
that
censorious
and
restricting
set
in
that
hospital
at
least
ambition
and
originality
would
be
allowed
to
show
what
they
could
do
unfettered
by
envy
or
paralyzed
by
conservatism
but
i
ca
think
of
anything
now
parsons
except
the
grand
secret
you
have
confided
to
me
a
hospital
it
is
an
ideal
gift
it
will
show
the
world
what
noble
uses
our
rich
men
make
of
their
money
and
it
will
give
our
doctors
and
our
people
a
chance
to
demonstrate
what
a
free
hospital
ought
to
be
oh
i
congratulate
you
i
will
write
to
lyons
at
once
a
note
in
prompt
response
stated
the
hour
when
the
lawyer
would
call
on
his
arrival
he
was
shown
immediately
to
parsons
apartments
with
whom
he
was
closeted
alone
selma
managed
to
cross
the
hall
at
the
moment
he
was
descending
and
he
was
easily
persuaded
to
linger
and
to
follow
her
into
the
library
i
was
anxious
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
lyons
she
said
i
know
the
purpose
for
which
parsons
sent
for
you
he
has
confided
to
me
concerning
his
will
told
me
everything
it
is
a
noble
disposition
of
his
property
a
free
hospital
for
benham
is
an
ideal
selection
and
one
envies
him
his
opportunity
yes
it
is
a
superb
and
generous
benefaction
i
lay
awake
for
hours
last
night
thinking
about
it
thinking
particularly
of
the
special
point
i
am
desirous
to
consult
you
in
regard
to
i
do
wish
to
appear
officious
or
to
say
anything
i
should
but
knowing
from
what
i
heard
you
state
in
your
speech
the
other
day
that
you
feel
as
i
do
in
regard
to
such
matters
i
take
the
liberty
of
suggesting
that
it
seems
to
me
of
very
great
importance
that
the
management
of
this
magnificent
gift
should
be
in
proper
hands
may
i
ask
you
without
impropriety
if
you
will
protect
parsons
so
that
captious
or
unenthusiastic
persons
men
or
women
will
be
unable
to
control
the
policy
of
his
hospital
he
would
wish
it
so
i
am
sure
i
thought
of
mentioning
the
matter
to
him
myself
but
i
was
afraid
lest
it
might
worry
him
and
spoil
the
satisfaction
of
his
generosity
or
retard
his
cure
is
what
i
ask
possible
do
i
make
myself
clear
perfectly
perfectly
a
valuable
suggestion
he
said
i
am
glad
that
you
have
spoken
very
glad
alive
as
i
am
to
the
importance
of
protecting
ourselves
at
all
points
i
might
not
have
realized
this
particular
danger
had
you
not
called
it
to
my
attention
perhaps
only
a
clever
woman
would
have
thought
of
it
oh
thank
you
i
felt
that
i
could
not
keep
silence
and
run
the
risk
of
what
might
happen
precisely
i
think
i
can
relieve
your
mind
by
telling
you
which
under
the
circumstances
is
no
breach
of
professional
secrecy
for
it
is
plain
that
the
testator
desires
you
to
know
his
purpose
that
parsons
has
done
me
the
honor
to
request
me
to
act
as
the
executor
of
his
will
as
such
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
make
sure
that
those
to
whom
the
management
of
his
hospital
is
intrusted
are
people
in
whom
you
and
i
would
have
confidence
ah
that
is
very
satisfactory
it
makes
everything
as
it
should
be
and
i
am
immensely
relieved
now
that
you
have
spoken
he
added
meeting
her
eager
gaze
with
a
propitiating
look
of
reflective
wisdom
i
will
consider
the
advisability
of
taking
the
further
precaution
of
advising
the
testator
to
name
in
his
will
the
persons
who
shall
act
as
the
trustees
of
his
charity
that
would
clinch
the
matter
the
selection
of
the
individuals
would
necessarily
lie
with
parsons
but
it
would
seem
eminently
natural
and
fitting
that
he
should
name
you
to
represent
your
sex
on
such
a
board
i
hope
it
would
be
agreeable
to
you
to
serve
selma
flushed
it
would
be
a
position
which
i
should
prize
immensely
such
a
possibility
had
not
occurred
to
me
though
i
felt
that
some
definite
provision
should
be
made
the
responsibility
would
be
congenial
to
me
and
very
much
in
my
line
assuredly
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
you
are
just
the
woman
for
the
place
we
have
met
only
a
few
times
littleton
but
i
am
a
man
who
forms
my
conclusions
of
people
rapidly
and
it
is
obvious
to
me
that
you
are
thoughtful
energetic
and
qualities
which
are
especially
requisite
for
intelligent
progress
in
work
it
is
essentially
desirable
to
enlist
the
of
women
to
promote
the
national
weal
lyons
departed
with
an
agreeable
impression
that
he
had
been
talking
to
a
woman
who
combined
mental
sagacity
and
enterprise
with
considerable
fascination
of
person
this
capable
companion
of
parsons
was
no
coquettish
or
simpering
beauty
no
mere
devotee
of
fashionable
manners
but
a
mature
character
endowed
with
ripe
intellectual
and
bodily
graces
their
interview
suggested
that
she
possessed
initiative
and
discretion
in
directing
the
course
of
events
and
a
strong
sense
of
moral
responsibility
attributes
which
attracted
his
interest
he
was
obliged
to
make
two
more
visits
before
the
execution
of
the
will
and
on
each
occasion
he
had
an
opportunity
to
spend
a
alone
in
the
society
of
selma
he
found
her
gravely
and
engagingly
sympathetic
with
his
advocacy
of
democratic
principles
he
told
her
of
his
ambition
to
be
elected
to
congress
an
ambition
which
he
believed
would
be
realized
the
following
autumn
he
confided
to
her
also
that
he
was
engaged
in
his
leisure
moments
in
the
preparation
of
a
literary
volume
to
be
entitled
watchwords
of
patriotism
a
study
of
the
requisites
of
the
best
citizenship
exemplified
by
pertinent
extracts
from
the
public
utterances
of
the
most
distinguished
american
public
servants
selma
on
her
part
reciprocated
by
a
reference
to
the
course
of
lectures
on
culture
and
higher
education
which
she
had
resolved
to
deliver
before
the
benham
institute
during
the
winter
in
these
lectures
she
meant
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
unfettered
individuality
and
to
comment
adversely
on
the
tendencies
hostile
to
this
fundamental
principle
of
progress
which
she
had
observed
in
new
york
and
from
which
benham
itself
did
not
appear
to
her
to
be
entirely
exempt
after
delivering
these
lectures
in
benham
she
intended
to
repeat
them
in
various
parts
of
the
state
and
in
some
of
the
large
cities
elsewhere
under
the
auspices
of
the
confederated
sisterhood
of
women
clubs
of
america
the
sorosis
which
earle
had
established
on
a
firm
basis
and
of
which
at
present
she
was
second
as
a
token
of
sympathy
with
this
undertaking
lyons
offered
to
procure
her
a
free
pass
on
the
railroads
over
which
she
would
be
obliged
to
travel
this
pleased
selma
greatly
for
she
had
always
regarded
free
passes
as
a
sign
of
mysterious
and
enviable
importance
two
months
later
selma
as
secretary
of
the
of
the
institute
selected
to
oppose
before
the
legislature
the
bill
to
create
an
appointed
school
board
had
further
occasion
to
confer
with
lyons
he
agreed
to
be
the
active
counsel
and
approved
of
the
plan
that
a
delegation
of
women
should
journey
to
the
capital
two
hours
and
a
half
by
rail
and
add
the
moral
support
of
their
presence
at
the
hearing
before
the
legislative
committee
the
expedition
was
another
gratification
to
selma
who
had
become
possessed
of
her
free
pass
she
felt
that
in
visiting
the
and
thus
taking
an
active
part
in
the
work
of
legislation
she
was
beginning
to
fulfil
the
larger
destiny
for
which
she
was
qualified
side
by
side
with
earle
at
the
head
of
a
delegation
of
twenty
benham
women
she
marched
augustly
into
the
committee
chamber
the
contending
factions
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
through
its
middle
ran
a
long
table
occupied
by
the
committee
on
education
to
which
the
bill
had
been
referred
among
the
dozen
or
fifteen
persons
who
appeared
in
support
of
the
bill
selma
perceived
hallett
taylor
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
her
return
she
was
disappointed
to
observe
that
taylor
clothes
though
unostentatious
were
in
the
latest
fashion
she
had
hoped
to
find
her
dowdy
or
unenlightened
and
to
be
able
to
look
down
on
her
from
the
heights
of
her
own
new
york
experience
the
lawyer
in
charge
of
the
bill
presented
lucidly
and
with
skill
the
merits
of
his
case
calling
to
the
stand
four
prominent
educators
from
as
many
different
sections
of
the
state
and
several
citizens
of
character
among
them
babcock
former
pastor
rev
henry
glynn
he
pointed
out
that
the
school
committee
as
at
present
constituted
was
an
unwieldy
body
of
members
that
it
was
regarded
as
the
first
round
in
the
ladder
of
political
preferment
and
that
the
members
which
composed
it
were
elected
not
on
the
ground
of
their
fitness
but
because
they
were
ambitious
for
political
recognition
the
legislative
committee
listened
politely
but
coldly
to
these
statements
and
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
it
was
evident
that
they
regarded
the
proposed
reform
with
distrust
do
you
mean
us
to
understand
that
the
public
schools
of
this
state
are
not
among
the
best
if
not
the
best
in
the
world
asked
one
member
of
the
committee
somewhat
sternly
i
recognize
the
merits
of
our
school
system
but
i
am
not
blind
to
its
faults
responded
the
attorney
in
charge
of
the
bill
he
was
a
man
who
possessed
the
courage
of
his
convictions
but
he
was
a
lawyer
of
tact
and
he
knew
that
his
answer
went
to
the
full
limit
of
what
he
could
safely
utter
by
way
of
qualification
without
hopelessly
imperilling
his
cause
are
not
our
public
schools
turning
out
yearly
hundreds
of
boys
and
girls
who
are
a
growing
credit
to
the
soundness
of
the
institutions
of
the
country
continued
the
same
inquisitor
here
was
a
proposition
which
opened
such
a
vista
of
circuitous
and
careful
speech
were
he
to
attempt
to
answer
it
and
be
true
to
conscience
without
being
false
to
patriotism
that
hunter
was
driven
to
reply
i
am
unable
to
deny
the
general
accuracy
of
your
statement
then
why
seek
to
harass
those
who
are
doing
such
good
work
by
unfriendly
legislation
the
member
plainly
felt
that
he
had
disposed
of
the
matter
by
this
triumphant
interrogation
for
he
listened
with
scant
attention
to
a
repetition
of
the
grounds
on
which
relief
was
sought
lyons
method
of
reply
was
a
surprise
to
selma
she
had
looked
for
a
fervid
vindication
of
the
principle
of
the
people
choice
and
an
eloquent
sarcastic
setting
forth
of
the
evils
of
the
exclusive
and
aristocratic
spirit
he
began
by
complimenting
the
members
of
the
committee
on
their
ability
to
deal
intelligently
with
the
important
question
before
them
and
then
proceeded
to
refer
to
the
sincere
but
mistaken
zeal
of
the
advocates
of
the
bill
whom
he
described
as
people
animated
by
conscientious
motives
but
unduly
distrustful
of
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
his
manner
suggested
a
desire
to
be
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
was
agreeably
conciliatory
as
though
he
deprecated
the
existence
of
friction
he
said
that
he
would
not
do
the
members
of
the
committee
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
they
could
seriously
favor
the
passage
of
a
bill
which
would
deprive
the
intelligent
average
voter
of
one
of
his
dearest
privileges
but
that
he
desired
to
put
himself
on
record
as
thinking
it
a
fortunate
circumstance
on
the
whole
that
the
promoters
of
the
bill
had
brought
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
legislature
and
had
an
opportunity
to
express
their
views
he
believed
that
the
hearing
would
be
productive
of
benefit
to
both
parties
in
that
on
the
one
hand
it
would
tend
to
make
the
voters
more
careful
as
to
whom
they
selected
for
the
important
duties
of
the
school
board
and
on
the
other
would
he
as
a
lover
of
democratic
institutions
hoped
serve
to
convince
the
friends
of
the
bill
that
they
had
exaggerated
the
evils
of
the
situation
and
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
false
and
hopeless
undertaking
in
seeking
to
confine
by
hard
and
fast
lines
the
spontaneous
yearnings
of
the
american
people
to
control
the
education
of
their
children
we
say
to
these
critics
he
continued
some
of
whom
are
enrolled
under
the
solemn
name
of
reformers
that
we
welcome
their
zeal
and
offer
in
a
resolute
purpose
to
exercise
unswerving
vigilance
in
the
selection
of
candidates
for
the
high
office
of
guardians
of
our
public
schools
so
far
as
they
will
join
hands
with
us
in
keeping
undefiled
the
traditions
of
our
forefathers
to
that
extent
we
are
heartily
in
accord
with
them
but
when
they
seek
to
override
those
traditions
and
to
fasten
upon
this
community
a
method
which
is
based
on
a
lack
of
confidence
in
democratic
theories
then
i
and
gentlemen
i
feel
sure
that
you
are
against
them
lyons
sat
down
having
given
everyone
in
the
room
with
the
exception
of
a
few
discerning
spirits
on
the
other
side
the
impression
that
he
had
intended
to
be
fair
and
that
he
had
held
out
the
olive
branch
when
he
would
have
been
justified
in
using
the
scourge
the
inclination
to
make
friends
to
smooth
over
seamy
situations
and
to
avoid
repellent
language
in
dealing
with
adversaries
except
in
corporation
cases
before
juries
and
on
special
occasions
when
defending
his
political
convictions
had
become
a
growing
tendency
with
him
now
that
he
was
in
training
for
public
office
selma
did
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
it
at
first
she
had
expected
that
he
would
crush
their
opponents
beneath
an
avalanche
of
righteous
invective
instead
he
took
his
seat
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
was
no
less
benignant
than
dignified
when
the
hearing
was
declared
closed
a
few
minutes
later
he
looked
in
her
direction
and
in
the
course
of
his
passage
to
where
she
was
sitting
stopped
to
exchange
affable
greetings
with
assemblymen
and
others
who
came
in
his
way
at
his
approach
earle
uttered
congratulations
so
comprehensive
that
selma
felt
able
to
refrain
for
the
moment
from
committing
herself
i
am
glad
that
you
were
pleased
he
said
i
think
i
covered
the
ground
and
no
one
feelings
have
been
hurt
as
though
he
divined
what
was
passing
through
mind
he
added
in
an
aside
intended
only
for
their
ears
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
all
our
powder
for
i
could
tell
from
the
way
the
committee
acted
that
they
were
with
us
i
felt
sure
they
would
be
exclaimed
earle
and
as
you
say
it
is
a
pleasure
that
no
one
feelings
were
hurt
and
that
we
can
all
part
friends
which
reminds
me
said
lyons
that
i
should
be
glad
of
an
introduction
to
taylor
as
she
passes
us
on
her
way
out
i
wish
to
assure
her
personally
of
my
willingness
to
further
her
efforts
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
school
board
that
would
be
nice
of
you
said
earle
and
ought
to
please
and
encourage
her
for
she
will
be
disappointed
poor
thing
and
after
all
i
suppose
she
means
well
there
she
is
now
and
i
will
keep
my
eye
on
her
but
surely
lyons
said
selma
dazed
yet
interested
by
this
doctrine
of
brotherly
love
do
you
think
our
school
committee
admirable
as
it
is
a
highly
efficient
body
he
answered
but
i
should
be
glad
to
have
our
opponents
mistaken
as
we
believe
them
to
be
appreciate
that
we
no
less
than
they
are
zealous
to
preserve
the
present
high
standard
we
must
make
them
recognize
that
we
are
reformers
and
in
sympathy
with
reform
i
see
said
selma
for
of
course
we
are
the
real
reformers
convert
them
you
mean
be
civil
to
them
at
least
i
understand
yes
i
suppose
there
is
no
use
in
making
enemies
of
them
she
was
thinking
aloud
though
ever
on
her
guard
to
resent
false
doctrine
she
was
so
sure
of
the
loyalty
of
both
her
companions
that
she
could
allow
herself
to
be
interested
by
this
new
point
of
view
a
vast
improvement
on
the
new
york
manner
because
of
its
ethical
suggestion
she
realized
that
if
lyons
was
certain
of
the
committee
it
was
right
and
at
the
same
time
sensible
not
to
hurt
anyone
feelings
unnecessarily
although
she
felt
a
little
suspicious
because
he
had
asked
to
be
introduced
to
taylor
indeed
the
more
she
thought
of
this
attitude
on
the
assumption
that
the
victory
was
assured
the
more
it
appealed
to
her
conscience
and
intelligence
so
much
so
that
when
earle
darted
forward
to
detain
taylor
selma
was
reflecting
with
admiration
on
his
magnanimity
she
observed
intently
the
meeting
between
lyons
and
taylor
he
was
deferential
complimentary
and
genial
and
he
made
a
suave
impressive
offer
of
his
personal
services
in
response
to
which
taylor
regarded
him
with
smiling
incredulity
a
smile
which
selma
considered
impertinent
how
dared
she
treat
his
courtly
advances
with
flippant
distrust
are
you
aware
lyons
taylor
was
saying
that
one
of
the
present
members
of
the
school
board
is
a
milkman
and
another
a
carpenter
both
of
them
persons
of
very
ordinary
efficiency
from
an
educational
standpoint
will
you
with
us
when
their
terms
expire
next
year
and
they
seek
to
nominate
more
suitable
candidates
in
their
stead
i
shall
be
very
glad
when
the
time
comes
to
investigate
carefully
their
qualifications
and
if
they
are
proved
to
be
unworthy
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
to
use
my
influence
against
them
you
may
rely
on
this
rely
on
my
cordial
support
and
the
support
of
these
ladies
he
added
indicating
earle
and
selma
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
who
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
are
no
less
interested
than
you
in
promoting
good
government
oh
yes
indeed
we
thought
we
were
making
an
ideal
choice
in
miss
luella
bailey
said
earle
with
effusion
if
taylor
had
seen
more
of
her
i
feel
sure
she
would
have
admired
her
and
then
our
institute
would
not
have
been
dragged
into
politics
taylor
did
not
attempt
to
answer
this
appeal
instead
she
greeted
selma
civilly
and
said
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
you
were
against
us
littleton
we
were
allies
once
in
a
good
cause
and
in
spite
of
lyons
protestations
to
the
contrary
i
assure
you
that
this
is
another
genuine
opportunity
to
improve
the
existing
order
of
things
at
least
she
added
gayly
but
firmly
you
must
not
let
lyons
predilection
to
see
everything
through
spectacles
prevent
you
from
looking
into
the
matter
on
your
own
account
i
have
done
so
already
answered
selma
affronted
at
the
suggestion
that
she
was
uninformed
yet
restrained
from
displaying
her
annoyance
by
the
sudden
inspiration
that
here
was
an
admirable
opportunity
to
practise
the
proselytizing
forbearance
suggested
by
lyons
the
idea
of
patronizing
taylor
from
the
of
infallibility
tinctured
by
magnanimous
condescension
appealed
to
her
i
have
made
a
thorough
study
of
the
question
and
i
never
could
look
at
it
as
you
do
taylor
i
sided
with
you
before
because
i
thought
you
were
right
because
you
were
in
favor
of
giving
everyone
a
chance
of
expression
but
now
i
on
the
other
side
for
the
same
reason
because
you
and
your
friends
are
disposed
to
deprive
people
of
that
very
thing
and
to
regard
their
aspirations
and
their
efforts
contemptuously
if
i
may
say
so
that
the
mistake
we
think
you
make
we
who
as
lyons
has
stated
are
no
less
eager
than
you
to
maintain
the
present
high
character
of
everything
which
concerns
our
school
system
but
if
you
only
would
see
things
in
a
little
different
light
both
earle
and
i
would
be
glad
to
welcome
you
as
an
ally
and
to
with
you
selma
had
not
expected
to
make
such
a
lengthy
speech
but
as
she
proceeded
she
was
spurred
by
the
desire
to
teach
taylor
her
proper
place
and
at
the
same
time
to
proclaim
her
own
allegiance
to
the
attitude
of
optimistic
forbearance
i
knew
that
was
the
way
they
felt
said
lyons
ingratiatingly
it
would
be
a
genuine
pleasure
to
us
all
to
see
this
unfortunate
difference
of
opinion
between
earnest
people
obviated
taylor
as
selma
was
pleased
to
note
flushed
at
her
concluding
offer
and
she
answered
drily
i
fear
that
we
are
too
far
apart
in
our
ideas
to
talk
of
if
our
bill
is
defeated
this
year
we
shall
have
to
persevere
and
trust
to
the
gradual
enlightenment
of
public
sentiment
good
afternoon
selma
left
the
in
an
elated
frame
of
mind
she
felt
that
she
had
taken
a
righteous
and
patriotic
stand
and
it
pleased
her
to
think
that
she
was
taking
an
active
part
in
defending
the
institutions
of
the
country
she
chatted
eagerly
as
she
walked
through
the
corridors
with
lyons
who
portly
and
imposing
acted
as
escort
to
her
and
earle
and
invited
them
to
luncheon
at
a
hotel
restaurant
excitement
had
given
her
more
color
than
usual
to
which
her
mourning
acted
as
a
foil
and
she
looked
her
best
lyons
was
proud
of
being
in
the
company
of
such
a
presentable
and
spirited
appearing
woman
and
made
a
point
of
stopping
two
or
three
members
of
the
legislature
and
introducing
them
to
her
when
they
reached
the
restaurant
he
established
them
at
a
table
where
they
could
see
everybody
and
be
seen
and
he
ordered
scolloped
oysters
coffee
and
some
bottles
of
sarsaparilla
both
women
were
in
high
spirits
and
selma
was
agreeably
conscious
that
people
were
observing
them
before
the
repast
was
over
a
messenger
brought
a
note
to
lyons
which
announced
that
the
legislative
committee
had
given
the
petitioners
leave
to
withdraw
their
bill
which
in
selma
eyes
justified
the
management
of
the
affair
and
set
the
seal
of
complete
success
on
an
already
absorbing
and
delightful
occasion
chapter
iv
her
mourning
and
the
slow
convalescence
of
parsons
deprived
selma
of
convincing
evidence
in
regard
to
her
social
reception
in
benham
for
those
socially
prominent
were
thus
barred
from
inviting
her
to
their
houses
and
her
own
activities
were
correspondingly
fettered
indeed
her
circumstances
supplied
her
with
an
obvious
salve
for
her
proper
dignity
had
she
been
disposed
to
let
suspicion
lie
fallow
as
it
was
a
number
of
people
had
left
cards
and
sent
invitations
notwithstanding
they
could
not
be
accepted
and
she
might
readily
have
believed
had
she
chosen
and
as
she
professed
openly
to
parsons
that
everyone
had
been
uncommonly
civil
and
appreciative
she
found
herself
however
in
spite
of
her
declared
devotion
to
her
serious
duties
noting
that
the
recognition
accorded
to
parsons
and
herself
was
not
precisely
of
the
character
she
craved
the
and
invitations
were
from
people
residing
on
the
river
drive
and
in
that
neighborhood
indeed
but
from
people
like
the
flaggs
for
instance
who
having
acquired
large
wealth
and
erected
lordly
dwellings
were
eager
to
dispense
lavish
hospitality
without
social
experience
her
sensitive
ordeal
in
new
york
had
quickened
her
social
perceptions
so
that
whereas
at
the
time
of
her
departure
from
benham
as
littleton
she
regarded
her
present
neighborhood
as
an
integral
class
she
was
now
prompt
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
and
to
remark
that
only
the
goats
seemed
conscious
of
her
existence
with
the
exception
of
taylor
who
had
called
when
she
was
out
not
one
of
a
certain
set
the
outward
manifestations
of
whose
stately
being
were
constantly
passing
her
windows
appeared
to
take
the
slightest
interest
in
her
strictly
speaking
taylor
was
of
this
set
yet
apart
from
it
hers
was
the
exclusive
intellectual
and
æsthetic
set
this
the
exclusive
fashionable
set
both
alike
execrable
and
foreign
to
the
traditions
of
benham
as
selma
had
discovered
the
one
and
declared
war
against
it
so
she
promised
herself
to
confound
the
other
when
the
period
of
her
mourning
was
over
and
she
was
free
to
appear
again
in
society
once
more
she
congratulated
herself
that
she
had
come
in
time
to
nip
in
the
bud
this
other
of
aristocratic
tendencies
as
yet
either
set
was
small
in
number
and
she
foresaw
that
it
would
be
an
easy
task
to
unite
in
a
solid
phalanx
of
influence
the
friendly
souls
whom
these
people
treated
as
outsiders
and
purge
the
society
atmosphere
of
the
miasma
of
exclusiveness
in
connection
with
the
means
to
this
end
when
the
winter
slipped
away
and
left
her
feeling
that
she
had
been
ignored
and
that
she
was
eager
to
assume
a
commanding
position
she
began
to
take
more
than
passing
thought
of
the
attentions
of
lyons
that
he
was
interested
by
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
for
he
plainly
went
out
of
his
way
to
seek
her
society
calling
at
the
house
from
time
to
time
and
exercising
a
useful
nattering
superintendence
over
her
lecture
course
in
the
other
cities
of
the
state
in
each
of
which
he
appeared
to
have
friends
on
the
newspaper
press
who
put
agreeable
notices
in
print
concerning
her
performance
she
had
returned
to
benham
believing
that
her
married
life
was
over
that
her
heart
was
in
the
grave
with
wilbur
and
that
she
would
never
again
part
with
her
independence
the
notice
which
lyons
had
taken
of
her
from
the
outset
had
gratified
her
but
though
she
contrasted
his
physical
energy
with
wilbur
lack
of
vigor
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
consider
him
in
the
light
of
a
possible
husband
now
that
a
year
had
passed
since
wilbur
death
she
felt
conscious
once
more
as
had
happened
after
her
divorce
of
the
need
of
a
closer
and
more
individual
sympathy
than
any
at
her
command
her
relations
with
parsons
to
be
sure
approximated
those
of
father
and
daughter
but
his
perceptions
were
much
less
acute
than
before
his
seizure
he
talked
little
and
ceased
to
take
a
vital
interest
in
current
affairs
she
felt
the
lack
of
companionship
and
also
of
personal
devotion
such
personal
devotion
as
was
afforded
by
the
strenuous
ardent
allegiance
of
a
man
on
the
other
hand
she
was
firmly
resolved
never
to
allow
the
current
of
her
own
life
to
be
turned
away
again
by
the
subordination
of
her
purposes
to
those
of
any
other
person
and
she
had
believed
that
this
resolution
would
keep
her
indifferent
to
marriage
in
spite
of
any
sensations
of
loneliness
or
craving
for
masculine
idolatry
but
as
a
widow
of
a
year
standing
she
was
now
suddenly
interested
by
the
thought
that
this
solid
ambitious
man
might
possibly
satisfy
her
natural
preference
for
a
mate
without
violating
her
individuality
she
began
to
ask
herself
if
he
were
not
truly
congenial
in
a
sense
which
no
man
had
ever
been
to
her
before
also
to
ask
if
their
aspirations
and
aims
were
not
so
nearly
identical
that
he
would
be
certain
as
her
husband
to
be
proud
of
everything
she
did
and
said
and
to
allow
her
to
work
hand
in
hand
with
him
for
the
furtherance
of
their
common
purpose
she
did
not
put
these
questions
to
herself
until
his
conduct
suggested
that
he
was
seeking
her
society
as
a
suitor
but
having
put
them
she
was
pleased
to
find
her
heart
throb
with
the
hope
of
a
stimulating
and
dear
discovery
certain
causes
contributed
to
convince
her
that
this
hope
rested
on
a
sure
foundation
causes
associated
with
her
present
life
and
point
of
view
she
felt
confident
first
of
all
of
the
godliness
of
lyons
as
indicated
not
only
by
his
sober
successful
life
and
his
enthusiastic
benignant
patriotism
but
by
his
active
reverent
interest
in
the
affairs
of
his
church
the
methodist
church
to
which
parsons
belonged
and
which
selma
had
begun
to
attend
since
her
return
to
benham
it
had
been
her
mother
faith
and
she
had
felt
a
certain
filial
glow
in
approaching
it
which
had
been
fanned
into
pious
flame
by
the
effect
of
the
ministration
the
fervent
hymns
and
the
opportunities
for
bearing
testimony
at
some
of
the
services
appealed
to
her
needs
and
gave
her
a
sense
of
oneness
with
eternal
truth
which
had
hitherto
been
lacking
from
her
religious
experience
in
judging
wilbur
she
was
disposed
to
ascribe
the
defects
of
his
character
largely
to
the
coldness
and
analyzing
sobriety
of
his
creed
she
had
accompanied
him
to
church
listlessly
and
had
been
bored
by
the
unemotional
appeals
to
conscience
and
quiet
subjective
designations
of
duty
she
preferred
to
thrill
with
the
intensity
of
words
which
now
roundly
rated
sin
now
passionately
called
to
mind
the
ransom
of
the
saviour
and
ever
kept
prominent
the
stirring
mission
of
evangelizing
ignorant
foreign
people
it
appeared
probable
to
selma
that
as
the
wife
of
one
of
the
leading
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
local
committee
charged
with
spreading
the
gospel
abroad
her
capacity
for
doing
good
would
be
strengthened
and
the
spiritual
availability
of
them
both
be
enhanced
then
too
lyons
political
prospects
were
flattering
the
thought
that
a
marriage
with
him
would
put
her
in
a
position
to
control
the
social
tendencies
of
benham
was
alluring
as
the
wife
of
hon
james
lyons
member
of
congress
she
believed
that
she
would
be
able
to
look
down
on
and
confound
those
who
had
given
her
the
cold
shoulder
what
would
flossy
say
when
she
heard
it
what
would
pauline
this
was
a
form
of
distinction
which
would
put
her
beyond
the
reach
of
conspiracy
and
exclusiveness
for
as
the
wife
of
a
representative
selected
by
the
people
to
guard
their
interests
and
make
their
laws
would
not
her
social
position
be
unassailable
and
apart
from
these
considerations
a
political
future
seemed
to
her
peculiarly
attractive
was
not
this
the
real
opportunity
for
which
she
had
been
waiting
would
she
be
justified
in
giving
it
up
in
what
better
way
could
her
talents
be
spent
than
as
the
helpmate
and
intellectual
companion
of
a
public
man
a
statesman
devoted
to
the
protection
and
development
of
american
ideas
her
own
individuality
need
not
would
not
be
repressed
she
had
seen
enough
of
lyons
to
feel
sure
that
their
views
on
the
great
questions
of
life
were
thoroughly
in
harmony
they
held
the
same
religious
opinions
who
could
foretell
the
limit
of
their
joint
progress
he
was
still
a
young
man
strong
dignified
and
patriotic
endowed
with
qualities
which
fitted
him
for
public
service
it
might
well
be
that
a
brilliant
future
was
before
him
before
them
if
she
were
his
wife
if
he
were
to
become
prominent
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
speaker
of
the
house
governor
even
president
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
what
a
splendid
congenial
scope
his
honors
would
afford
her
own
versatility
as
day
by
day
she
dwelt
on
these
points
of
recommendation
selma
became
more
and
more
disposed
to
smile
on
the
aspirations
of
lyons
in
regard
to
herself
and
to
feel
that
her
life
would
develop
to
the
best
advantage
by
a
union
with
him
until
the
words
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
were
definitely
spoken
she
could
not
be
positive
of
his
intentions
but
his
conduct
left
little
room
for
doubt
and
moreover
was
marked
by
a
deferential
soberness
of
purpose
which
indicated
to
her
that
his
views
regarding
marriage
were
on
a
higher
plane
than
those
of
any
man
she
had
known
he
referred
frequently
to
the
home
as
the
foundation
on
which
american
civilization
rested
and
from
which
its
inspiration
was
largely
derived
and
spoke
feelingly
of
the
value
to
a
public
man
of
a
stimulating
and
dignifying
fireside
it
became
his
habit
to
join
her
after
morning
service
and
to
accompany
her
home
carrying
her
and
he
sent
her
from
time
to
time
through
the
post
quotations
which
had
especially
struck
his
fancy
from
the
speeches
he
was
collecting
for
his
watchwords
of
patriotism
another
six
months
passed
and
at
its
close
lyons
received
the
expected
nomination
for
congress
the
election
promised
to
be
close
and
exciting
both
parties
were
confident
of
victory
and
were
preparing
vigorously
to
keep
their
adherents
at
fever
pitch
by
rallies
and
processions
although
the
result
of
the
caucus
was
not
doubtful
it
was
understood
between
lyons
and
selma
that
he
would
call
at
the
house
that
evening
to
let
her
know
that
he
had
been
successful
she
was
waiting
to
receive
him
in
the
library
parsons
had
gone
to
bed
his
condition
was
not
promising
he
had
recently
suffered
another
slight
attack
of
paralysis
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
liable
at
any
time
to
a
fatal
seizure
lyons
entered
smilingly
so
far
so
good
he
exclaimed
then
you
have
won
oh
yes
as
i
told
you
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
now
the
fight
begins
selma
who
had
provided
a
slight
refection
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
be
chosen
she
said
see
if
i
am
not
right
when
is
the
election
in
six
weeks
six
weeks
from
then
you
will
go
to
washington
to
live
not
until
the
fourth
of
march
i
envy
you
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
prefer
success
in
politics
to
anything
else
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
will
you
help
me
to
achieve
success
will
you
go
with
me
to
washington
as
my
wife
his
courtship
had
been
formal
and
elaborate
but
his
declaration
was
signally
simple
and
to
the
point
selma
noticed
that
the
cup
in
his
hand
trembled
while
she
kept
her
eyes
lowered
as
women
are
supposed
to
do
at
such
moments
she
was
wondering
whether
she
loved
him
as
much
as
she
had
loved
wilbur
not
so
ardently
but
more
worthily
she
concluded
for
he
seemed
to
her
to
fulfil
her
maturer
ideal
of
strong
and
effective
manhood
and
to
satisfy
alike
her
and
her
physical
fancy
a
man
of
his
type
would
not
split
hairs
but
proceed
straight
toward
the
goal
of
his
ambition
without
fainting
or
wavering
why
should
she
not
satisfy
her
renewed
craving
to
be
yoked
to
a
kindred
spirit
and
companion
who
appreciated
her
true
worth
i
can
not
believe
he
was
saying
that
my
words
are
a
surprise
to
you
you
can
scarcely
have
failed
to
understand
that
i
admired
you
extremely
i
have
delayed
to
utter
my
desire
to
make
you
my
wife
because
i
did
not
dare
to
cherish
too
fondly
the
hope
that
the
love
inspired
in
me
could
be
reciprocated
and
that
you
would
consent
to
unite
your
life
to
mine
and
trust
your
happiness
to
my
keeping
if
i
may
say
so
we
are
no
boy
and
girl
we
understand
the
solemn
significance
of
marriage
what
it
imports
and
what
it
demands
of
late
i
have
ventured
to
dream
that
the
sympathy
in
ideas
and
identity
of
purpose
which
exist
between
us
might
be
the
trustworthy
sign
of
a
spiritual
bond
which
we
could
not
afford
to
ignore
i
feel
that
without
you
the
joy
and
power
of
my
life
will
be
incomplete
with
you
at
my
side
i
shall
aspire
to
great
things
you
are
to
me
the
embodiment
of
what
is
charming
and
serviceable
in
woman
selma
looked
up
i
like
you
very
much
lyons
you
in
your
turn
must
have
realized
that
i
think
as
you
say
we
are
no
boy
and
girl
you
meant
by
that
too
that
we
both
have
been
married
before
i
have
had
two
husbands
and
i
did
not
believe
that
i
could
ever
think
of
marriage
again
i
do
wish
you
to
suppose
that
my
last
marriage
was
not
happy
littleton
was
an
earnest
talented
man
and
devoted
to
me
yet
i
can
not
deny
that
in
spite
of
mutual
love
our
married
life
was
not
a
success
a
success
as
a
contribution
to
accomplishment
that
nearly
broke
my
heart
and
he
he
died
from
lack
of
the
physical
and
mental
vigor
which
would
have
made
so
much
difference
i
am
telling
you
this
because
i
wish
you
to
realize
that
if
i
should
consent
to
comply
with
your
wishes
it
would
be
because
i
was
convinced
that
true
accomplishment
the
highest
accomplishment
would
result
from
the
union
of
our
lives
as
the
result
of
our
riper
experience
if
i
did
not
believe
lyons
that
man
and
woman
as
we
are
no
longer
boy
and
girl
a
more
perfect
scheme
of
happiness
a
grander
conception
of
the
meaning
of
life
than
either
of
us
had
entertained
was
before
us
i
would
not
consider
your
offer
for
one
moment
yes
yes
i
understand
lyons
exclaimed
eagerly
i
share
your
belief
implicitly
it
was
what
i
would
have
said
only
despite
his
facility
as
an
orator
lyons
left
this
sentence
incomplete
in
face
of
the
ticklish
difficulty
of
explaining
that
he
had
refrained
from
suggesting
such
a
hope
to
a
widow
who
had
lost
her
husband
only
two
years
before
yet
he
hastened
to
bridge
over
this
ellipsis
by
saying
without
such
a
faith
a
union
between
us
must
fall
short
of
its
sweetest
and
grandest
opportunities
it
would
be
a
mockery
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
its
existence
cried
selma
impetuously
i
am
an
idealist
lyons
she
said
clasping
her
hands
i
believe
devotedly
in
the
mission
and
power
of
love
but
i
believe
that
our
conception
of
love
changes
as
we
grow
i
welcomed
love
formerly
as
an
intoxicating
delirious
potion
and
as
such
it
was
very
sweet
you
have
just
told
me
of
your
own
feelings
toward
me
so
it
is
your
right
to
know
that
lately
i
have
begun
to
realize
that
my
association
with
you
has
brought
peace
into
my
life
peace
and
religious
faith
essentials
of
happiness
of
which
i
have
not
known
the
blessings
since
i
was
a
child
you
have
dedicated
yourself
to
a
lofty
work
you
have
chosen
the
noble
career
of
a
statesman
a
statesman
zealous
to
promote
principles
in
which
we
both
believe
and
you
ask
me
to
share
with
you
the
labors
and
the
privileges
which
will
result
from
this
dedication
if
i
accept
your
offer
it
must
be
because
i
know
that
i
love
you
love
you
in
a
sense
i
have
not
loved
before
may
the
dead
pardon
me
if
i
accept
you
it
will
be
because
i
wish
to
perpetuate
that
faith
and
peace
and
because
i
believe
that
our
joint
lives
will
realize
worthy
accomplishment
selma
looked
into
space
with
her
wrapt
gaze
apparently
engaged
in
an
intense
mental
struggle
and
you
will
accept
you
do
feel
that
you
can
return
my
love
i
can
not
tell
you
how
greatly
i
am
stirred
and
stimulated
by
what
you
have
said
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
could
never
be
happy
without
you
lyons
put
into
this
speech
all
his
solemnity
and
all
his
emotional
beneficence
of
temperament
he
was
genuinely
moved
his
first
marriage
had
been
a
love
match
his
wife
a
mere
girl
had
died
within
a
year
so
soon
that
the
memory
of
her
was
a
tender
but
hazy
sentiment
rather
than
a
formulated
impression
of
character
by
virtue
of
this
memory
he
had
approached
marriage
again
as
one
seeking
a
companion
for
his
fireside
and
a
comely
sensible
woman
to
preside
over
his
establishment
and
promote
his
social
status
rather
than
one
expecting
to
be
possessed
by
or
to
inspire
a
dominant
passion
yet
he
too
regarded
himself
distinctly
as
an
idealist
and
he
had
lent
a
greedy
ear
to
selma
suggestion
that
mature
mutual
sympathy
and
comradeship
in
establishing
convictions
and
religious
aims
were
the
source
of
a
nobler
type
of
love
than
that
associated
with
early
matrimony
it
increased
his
admiration
for
her
and
gave
to
his
courtship
the
touch
of
idealism
which
partly
owing
to
his
own
modesty
as
a
man
no
longer
in
the
flush
of
youth
it
had
lacked
he
nervously
stroked
his
beard
with
his
thick
hand
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
spell
of
this
vision
of
blessedness
while
he
eagerly
watched
selma
face
and
waited
for
her
answer
to
combine
moral
purpose
and
love
in
a
pervasive
alliance
appealed
to
him
magnetically
as
a
religious
man
selma
as
she
faced
lyons
was
conscious
necessarily
of
the
contrast
between
him
and
her
late
husband
but
she
was
attuned
to
regard
his
coarser
physical
fibre
as
masculine
vigor
and
a
protest
against
aristocratic
delicacy
and
to
derive
comfort
and
exaltation
from
it
lyons
she
said
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
the
circumstances
of
married
life
have
hitherto
hampered
the
expression
of
that
which
is
in
me
and
confined
the
scope
of
my
individuality
within
narrow
and
uncongenial
limits
i
am
not
complaining
i
have
no
intention
to
rake
up
the
past
but
it
is
proper
you
should
know
that
i
believe
myself
capable
of
larger
undertakings
than
have
yet
been
afforded
me
and
worthy
of
ampler
recognition
than
i
have
yet
received
if
i
accept
you
as
a
husband
it
will
be
because
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
give
my
life
the
opportunity
to
expand
and
that
you
sympathize
with
my
desire
to
express
myself
adequately
and
to
labor
hand
in
hand
side
by
side
with
you
in
the
important
work
of
the
world
that
is
what
i
would
have
you
do
selma
because
you
are
worthy
of
it
and
because
it
is
your
right
on
that
understanding
it
seems
that
we
might
be
very
happy
i
am
certain
of
it
you
fill
my
soul
with
gladness
he
cried
and
seizing
her
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
covered
it
with
kisses
but
she
withdrew
it
saying
not
yet
not
yet
this
step
represents
so
much
to
me
it
means
that
if
i
am
mistaken
in
you
my
whole
life
will
be
ruined
for
the
next
years
should
be
my
best
we
must
not
be
too
hasty
there
are
many
things
to
be
thought
of
i
must
consider
parsons
i
can
not
leave
him
immediately
if
at
all
for
he
is
very
dependent
on
me
i
had
thought
of
that
while
parsons
lives
i
realize
that
your
first
duty
must
be
to
him
the
reverential
gravity
of
his
tone
was
in
excess
of
the
needs
of
the
occasion
and
selma
understood
that
he
intended
to
imply
that
parsons
would
not
long
need
her
care
the
same
thought
was
in
her
own
mind
and
it
had
occurred
to
her
in
the
course
of
her
previous
cogitations
in
regard
to
lyons
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
it
would
suit
her
admirably
to
continue
to
occupy
the
house
as
its
real
mistress
she
looked
grave
for
a
moment
in
her
turn
then
with
a
sudden
access
of
coyness
she
murmured
i
do
not
believe
that
i
am
mistaken
in
you
ah
he
cried
and
would
have
folded
her
in
his
arms
but
she
evaded
his
onset
and
said
with
her
dramatic
intonation
the
knights
of
old
won
their
by
brilliant
deeds
if
you
are
elected
a
member
of
congress
you
may
come
to
claim
me
reflection
served
only
to
convince
selma
of
the
wisdom
of
her
decision
to
try
matrimony
once
more
she
argued
that
though
a
third
marriage
might
theoretically
seem
repugnant
if
stated
as
a
bald
fact
the
actual
circumstances
in
her
case
not
merely
exonerated
her
from
a
lack
of
delicacy
but
afforded
an
exhibition
of
progress
a
gradual
evolution
in
character
she
felt
and
triumphant
at
the
thought
of
her
impending
new
importance
as
the
wife
of
a
public
man
and
she
interested
herself
exuberantly
in
the
progress
of
the
political
campaign
she
was
pleased
to
think
that
her
stipulation
had
given
her
lover
a
new
spur
to
his
ambition
and
she
was
prepared
to
believe
that
his
victory
would
be
due
to
the
exhaustive
efforts
to
win
which
the
cruel
possibility
of
losing
her
obliged
him
to
make
this
was
a
campaign
era
of
processions
the
rival
factions
expressed
their
confidence
and
enthusiasm
by
parading
at
night
in
a
series
of
battalions
armed
with
torches
some
resplendently
flaring
some
glittering
gayly
through
colored
glass
and
bearing
transparencies
inscribed
with
trenchant
sentiments
the
houses
of
their
adherents
along
the
route
were
illuminated
from
attic
to
cellar
with
rows
of
candles
and
the
atmosphere
wore
a
dusky
glow
of
red
and
green
fire
to
selma
all
this
was
entrancing
she
revelled
in
it
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
conspicuous
life
which
she
was
about
to
lead
she
showed
herself
a
zealous
and
enthusiastic
partisan
shrouding
the
house
in
the
darkness
of
erebus
on
the
occasion
when
the
rival
procession
passed
the
door
and
imparting
to
every
window
the
effect
of
a
blaze
of
light
on
the
following
evening
the
night
before
election
when
the
democratic
party
made
its
final
appeal
to
the
voters
standing
on
a
balcony
in
evening
dress
in
company
with
earle
and
miss
luella
bailey
whom
she
had
invited
to
view
the
procession
from
the
river
drive
selma
looked
down
on
the
parade
in
an
ecstatic
mood
the
torches
the
music
the
fireworks
and
the
enthusiasm
set
her
pulses
astir
and
brought
her
heart
into
her
mouth
in
melting
appreciation
of
the
sanctity
of
her
party
cause
and
her
own
enviable
destiny
as
the
wife
of
an
american
congressman
she
held
in
one
hand
a
flag
which
she
waved
from
time
to
time
at
the
conspicuous
features
of
the
procession
and
she
stationed
herself
so
that
the
bengal
lights
and
other
fireworks
set
off
by
parsons
hired
man
should
throw
her
figure
into
conspicuous
relief
the
culminating
interest
of
the
occasion
for
her
was
reached
when
the
james
lyons
cadets
the
special
body
of
youthful
devoted
to
advertising
the
merits
of
her
lover
for
whose
uniforms
and
accoutrements
he
had
paid
came
in
sight
they
proved
to
be
the
most
flourishing
looking
organization
in
line
they
were
preceded
by
a
large
nattily
attired
drum
corps
their
ranks
were
full
their
torches
lustrous
and
they
bore
a
number
of
transparencies
setting
forth
the
predominant
qualifications
of
the
candidate
for
congress
from
the
second
district
the
largest
of
which
presented
his
portrait
superscribed
with
the
sentiment
a
vote
for
james
lyons
is
a
vote
in
support
of
the
liberties
of
the
plain
people
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
canvas
was
the
picture
of
the
king
of
beasts
with
open
jaws
and
bristling
mane
with
the
motto
our
lyons
might
will
keep
our
institutions
sacred
in
the
midst
of
this
glittering
escort
the
candidate
himself
rode
in
an
open
barouche
on
his
way
to
the
hall
where
he
was
to
deliver
a
final
speech
he
was
bowing
to
right
and
left
and
constant
cheers
marked
his
progress
along
the
avenue
selma
leaned
forward
from
the
balcony
to
obtain
the
earliest
sight
of
her
hero
the
rolling
applause
was
a
new
intoxicating
music
in
her
ears
and
filled
her
soul
with
transport
she
clapped
her
hands
vehemently
seized
a
and
amid
a
blaze
of
fiery
sparks
exploded
its
colored
stars
in
the
direction
of
the
approaching
carriage
then
with
the
flag
slanted
across
her
bosom
she
stood
waiting
for
his
recognition
it
was
made
solemnly
but
with
the
unequivocal
demonstration
of
a
cavalier
or
knight
of
old
for
lyons
stood
up
and
doffing
his
hat
toward
her
made
a
conspicuous
salute
a
salvo
of
applause
suggested
to
selma
that
the
multitude
had
understood
that
he
was
according
to
her
the
homage
due
a
and
that
their
cheers
were
partly
meant
for
her
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
with
the
gesture
of
a
queen
of
melodrama
and
culling
one
from
a
bunch
of
roses
lyons
had
sent
her
that
afternoon
threw
it
from
the
balcony
at
the
carriage
the
flower
fell
almost
into
the
lap
of
her
lover
who
clutched
it
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
doffed
his
hat
again
the
episode
had
been
visible
to
many
and
a
hoarse
murmur
of
interested
approval
crowned
the
performance
the
glance
of
the
crowds
on
the
sidewalk
was
turned
upward
and
someone
proposed
three
cheers
for
the
lady
in
the
balcony
they
were
given
selma
bowed
to
either
side
in
delighted
acknowledgment
while
the
torches
of
the
cadets
waved
tumultuously
and
there
was
a
fresh
outburst
of
colored
fires
i
ca
keep
the
secret
any
longer
she
exclaimed
turning
to
her
two
companions
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
mr
lyons
chapter
lyons
was
chosen
to
congress
by
a
liberal
margin
the
congressional
delegation
from
his
state
was
almost
evenly
divided
between
the
two
parties
as
the
result
of
the
election
and
the
majorities
in
every
case
were
small
consequently
the
more
complete
victory
of
lyons
was
a
feather
in
his
cap
and
materially
enhanced
his
political
standing
the
sudden
death
of
parsons
within
a
week
of
the
election
saved
selma
conscience
from
the
strain
of
arranging
a
harmonious
and
equitable
separation
from
him
she
had
felt
that
the
enlargement
of
her
sphere
of
life
and
the
opportunity
to
serve
her
country
which
this
marriage
offered
were
paramount
to
any
other
considerations
but
she
was
duly
conscious
that
parsons
would
miss
her
sorely
and
she
was
considering
the
feasibility
of
substituting
miss
bailey
as
his
companion
in
her
place
when
fate
supplied
a
different
solution
selma
had
pledged
her
friends
to
secrecy
so
that
parsons
need
know
nothing
until
the
plans
for
his
happiness
had
been
perfected
and
he
died
in
ignorance
of
the
interesting
matrimonial
alliance
which
had
been
fostered
under
his
roof
by
the
terms
of
his
will
selma
was
bequeathed
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
had
promised
her
she
and
lyons
with
a
third
person
to
be
selected
by
them
were
appointed
trustees
of
the
free
hospital
with
which
he
had
endowed
benham
and
lyons
was
nominated
as
the
sole
executor
under
the
will
selma
conception
that
her
third
betrothal
was
coincident
with
spiritual
development
and
that
she
had
fought
her
way
through
hampering
circumstances
to
a
higher
plane
of
experience
had
taken
firm
hold
of
her
imagination
she
presently
confessed
to
lyons
that
she
had
not
hitherto
appreciated
the
full
meaning
of
the
dogma
that
marriage
was
a
sacrament
she
evinced
a
disposition
to
show
herself
with
him
at
church
gatherings
and
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
his
pastor
she
felt
that
she
had
finally
secured
the
opportunity
to
live
the
sober
simple
life
appropriate
to
those
who
believed
in
maintaining
american
principles
and
in
eschewing
luxurious
and
effete
foreign
innovations
the
sort
of
life
she
had
always
meant
to
live
and
from
which
she
had
been
debarred
she
had
now
not
only
opportunity
but
a
responsibility
as
the
bride
of
a
congressman
it
behooved
her
both
to
pursue
virtue
for
its
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
example
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
preserve
and
promote
democratic
conditions
in
signal
opposition
to
fashionable
society
and
at
the
same
time
to
assert
her
own
proper
dignity
and
the
dignity
of
her
constituents
by
a
suitable
outward
show
this
last
subtlety
of
reflection
convinced
selma
that
they
ought
to
occupy
the
house
on
the
river
drive
lyons
himself
expressed
some
doubts
as
to
the
advisability
of
this
he
admitted
that
he
could
afford
the
expense
and
that
it
was
just
such
a
residence
as
he
desired
but
he
suggested
that
their
motives
might
not
be
understood
and
he
questioned
whether
it
were
wise
with
the
state
so
close
to
give
his
political
enemies
the
chance
to
make
unjust
accusations
of
course
you
ought
to
understand
about
this
matter
better
than
i
she
said
but
i
have
the
feeling
james
that
your
constituents
will
be
disappointed
if
we
do
show
ourselves
appreciative
of
the
dignity
of
your
position
we
both
agree
that
we
should
make
benham
our
home
and
that
it
will
be
preferable
if
i
visit
washington
a
month
or
two
at
a
time
during
the
session
rather
than
for
us
to
set
up
housekeeping
there
and
i
ca
help
believing
that
the
people
will
be
better
pleased
if
you
as
their
representative
make
that
home
all
which
a
beautiful
home
should
be
they
will
be
proud
of
it
and
if
they
are
you
need
mind
what
a
few
say
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
make
a
mistake
to
let
this
house
go
it
just
suits
us
i
feel
sure
that
in
their
hearts
the
american
people
like
to
have
their
public
men
live
comfortably
this
house
is
small
compared
to
many
in
new
york
and
i
flatter
myself
that
we
shall
be
able
to
satisfy
everyone
that
we
are
rootedly
opposed
to
unseemly
extravagance
of
living
lyons
yielded
readily
to
this
argument
he
had
been
accustomed
to
simple
surroundings
but
travel
and
the
growth
of
benham
itself
had
demonstrated
to
him
that
the
ways
of
the
nation
in
respect
to
material
possessions
and
comforts
had
undergone
a
marked
change
since
his
youth
he
had
been
brought
in
contact
with
this
new
development
in
his
capacity
of
adviser
to
the
magnates
of
benham
and
he
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
improved
creature
comforts
still
though
he
cast
sheep
eyes
at
these
flesh
pots
he
had
felt
chary
both
as
a
worker
for
righteousness
and
an
ardent
champion
of
popular
principles
of
countenancing
them
openly
yet
his
original
impulse
toward
marriage
had
been
a
desire
to
secure
an
establishment
and
now
that
this
result
was
at
hand
he
found
himself
ambitious
to
put
his
household
on
a
braver
footing
provided
this
would
do
injury
neither
to
his
moral
scruples
nor
to
his
political
sincerity
the
problem
was
but
another
phase
of
that
presented
to
him
by
his
evolution
from
a
jury
lawyer
whose
hand
and
voice
were
against
corporations
to
the
status
of
a
richly
paid
chamber
adviser
to
railroads
and
banking
houses
he
was
exactly
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
grasp
at
the
euphemism
offered
by
selma
he
was
not
one
to
be
convinced
without
a
reason
but
his
mind
eagerly
welcomed
a
suggestion
which
justified
on
a
moral
ground
the
proceeding
to
which
they
were
both
inclined
the
idea
that
the
people
would
prefer
to
see
him
as
their
representative
living
in
a
style
consistent
with
the
changes
in
manners
and
customs
introduced
by
national
prosperity
affording
thereby
an
example
of
correct
and
elevating
stewardship
of
reasonable
wealth
by
way
of
contrast
to
vapid
society
doings
came
to
him
as
an
illumination
which
dissipated
his
doubts
the
wedding
took
place
about
three
months
after
the
death
of
parsons
in
her
renovated
outlook
regarding
matrimony
selma
included
formal
preparations
for
and
some
pomp
of
circumstances
at
the
ceremony
it
suited
her
pious
mood
that
she
was
not
required
again
to
be
married
and
that
she
could
plight
her
troth
in
a
decorous
fashion
suitably
attired
and
amid
conventional
surroundings
her
dress
was
a
subject
of
considerable
contemplation
she
guided
her
lover
generosity
until
it
centred
on
a
diamond
spray
for
her
hair
and
two
rings
set
with
handsome
precious
stones
she
did
not
discourage
miss
luella
bailey
from
heralding
the
approaching
nuptials
in
the
press
she
became
lyons
in
a
conspicuous
and
solemn
fashion
before
the
gaze
of
everybody
in
benham
whom
there
was
any
excuse
for
asking
to
the
church
after
a
collation
at
the
parsons
house
the
happy
pair
started
on
their
honeymoon
in
a
special
car
put
at
their
service
by
one
of
the
railroads
for
which
the
bridegroom
was
counsel
this
feature
delighted
selma
indeed
everything
from
the
complimentary
embrace
of
her
pastor
to
the
details
of
her
dress
and
wedding
presents
described
with
elaborate
good
will
in
the
evening
newspapers
appeared
to
her
gratifying
and
appropriate
they
were
absent
six
weeks
during
which
the
parsons
house
was
to
be
redecorated
and
embellished
within
and
without
according
to
instructions
given
by
selma
before
her
departure
their
trip
extended
to
california
by
way
of
the
yosemite
selma
had
never
seen
the
wonders
of
the
far
western
scenery
and
this
appropriate
background
for
their
sentiment
also
afforded
lyons
the
opportunity
to
inspect
certain
railroad
lines
in
which
he
was
financially
interested
the
atmosphere
of
the
gorgeous
peaks
and
impressive
chasms
served
to
heighten
still
further
the
intensity
of
selma
frame
of
mind
she
managed
adroitly
on
several
occasions
to
let
people
know
who
they
were
and
it
pleased
her
to
observe
the
conductor
indicating
to
passengers
in
the
common
cars
that
they
were
congressman
lyons
and
his
wife
on
their
honeymoon
she
was
looking
forward
to
washington
and
as
she
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
inspiring
beauties
of
nature
she
was
prone
to
draw
herself
up
in
rehearsal
of
the
dignity
which
she
expected
to
wear
what
were
these
mountains
and
canyons
but
physical
counterparts
of
the
human
soul
what
but
correlative
representatives
of
grand
ideas
of
noble
lives
devoted
to
the
cause
of
human
liberty
she
felt
that
she
was
very
happy
and
she
bore
testimony
to
this
by
walking
arm
in
arm
with
her
husband
leaning
against
his
firm
stalwart
shoulder
it
seemed
to
her
desirable
that
the
public
should
know
that
they
were
a
happy
couple
and
defenders
of
the
purity
of
the
home
on
their
way
back
the
train
was
delayed
on
washington
birthday
for
several
hours
by
a
and
presently
a
deputation
made
up
of
passengers
and
townspeople
waited
on
lyons
and
invited
him
to
deliver
an
address
he
and
selma
when
the
committee
arrived
were
just
about
to
explore
the
neighborhood
and
lyons
though
ordinarily
he
would
have
been
glad
of
such
an
opportunity
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
expression
which
suggested
that
he
would
prefer
a
walk
with
her
the
eyes
of
the
committee
followed
his
appreciating
that
he
had
thrown
the
responsibility
of
a
decision
on
his
bride
selma
was
equal
to
the
occasion
of
course
he
will
address
you
she
exclaimed
what
more
suitable
place
could
there
be
for
offering
homage
to
the
father
of
our
country
than
this
majestic
prairie
she
added
proudly
and
i
am
glad
you
should
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
my
husband
speak
some
letters
requiring
attention
were
forwarded
to
lyons
at
one
of
the
cities
where
they
stopped
as
they
lay
on
his
selma
caught
sight
of
the
return
address
williams
van
horne
printed
on
the
uppermost
envelope
the
reminder
aroused
a
host
of
associations
flossy
had
not
been
much
in
her
thoughts
lately
yet
she
had
not
failed
to
plume
herself
occasionally
with
the
reflection
that
she
could
afford
now
to
snap
her
fingers
at
her
she
had
wondered
more
than
once
what
flossy
would
think
when
she
heard
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
representative
do
you
know
these
people
personally
she
inquired
holding
up
the
envelope
yes
they
are
my
er
financial
representatives
in
new
york
i
have
considerable
dealings
with
them
selma
had
not
up
to
this
time
concerned
herself
as
to
the
details
of
her
husband
affairs
he
had
made
clear
to
her
that
his
income
from
his
profession
was
large
and
she
knew
that
he
was
interested
in
a
variety
of
enterprises
that
he
should
have
connections
with
a
firm
of
new
york
brokers
was
one
more
proof
to
her
of
his
common
sense
and
capacity
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
littleton
used
to
buy
stocks
through
williams
and
van
horne
only
a
few
he
was
not
very
clever
at
it
and
failed
to
make
the
most
of
the
chances
given
him
to
succeed
in
that
way
we
knew
the
williamses
at
one
time
very
well
they
lived
in
the
same
block
with
us
for
several
years
after
we
were
married
williams
is
a
capable
driving
sort
of
fellow
bold
but
on
the
whole
sagacious
i
think
answered
lyons
with
demure
urbanity
it
was
rather
a
shock
to
him
that
his
wife
should
learn
that
he
had
dealings
in
the
stock
market
he
feared
lest
it
might
seem
to
her
inconsistent
with
his
other
propensities
his
religious
convictions
and
his
abhorrence
of
corporate
rapacity
he
preferred
to
keep
such
transactions
private
for
fear
they
should
be
misunderstood
at
heart
he
did
not
altogether
approve
of
them
himself
they
were
a
part
of
his
evolution
and
had
developed
by
degrees
until
they
had
become
now
so
interwoven
with
his
whole
financial
outlook
that
he
could
not
escape
from
them
at
the
moment
if
he
would
indeed
some
of
them
were
giving
him
anxiety
he
had
supposed
that
the
letter
in
question
contained
a
request
for
a
remittance
to
cover
depreciation
in
his
account
instead
he
had
read
with
some
annoyance
a
confidential
request
from
williams
that
he
would
work
for
a
certain
bill
which
in
his
capacity
as
a
foe
of
monopoly
he
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
oppose
it
offended
his
conscience
to
think
that
he
might
be
obliged
secretly
to
befriend
a
measure
against
which
his
vote
must
be
cast
as
has
been
intimated
he
would
have
preferred
that
his
business
affairs
should
remain
concealed
from
his
wife
yet
her
remarks
were
unexpectedly
and
agreeably
reassuring
they
served
to
furnish
a
fresh
indication
on
her
part
of
intelligent
sympathy
with
the
perplexities
which
beset
the
path
of
an
ambitious
public
man
they
suggested
a
subtle
appreciation
of
the
reasonableness
of
his
behavior
notwithstanding
its
apparent
failure
to
tally
with
his
outward
professions
selma
reply
interrupted
this
rhapsody
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
suppose
that
i
quarrelled
with
williams
before
i
left
new
york
or
rather
she
quarrelled
with
me
she
insulted
me
in
my
own
house
and
i
was
obliged
to
order
her
to
leave
it
quarrelled
that
is
a
pity
an
open
break
open
breaks
in
friendship
are
always
unfortunate
lyons
looked
grieved
and
fingered
his
beard
meditatively
i
appreciate
said
selma
frankly
that
our
falling
out
will
be
an
inconvenience
in
case
we
should
meet
in
washington
or
elsewhere
since
you
and
williams
have
business
interests
in
common
of
course
james
i
wish
to
help
you
in
every
way
i
can
i
might
as
well
tell
you
about
it
i
think
she
was
jealous
of
me
and
fancied
i
was
trying
to
cut
her
out
socially
at
all
events
she
insinuated
that
i
was
not
a
lady
because
i
would
not
lower
my
standards
to
hers
and
adopt
the
frivolous
habits
of
her
little
set
but
i
have
not
forgotten
james
your
suggestion
that
people
in
public
life
can
accomplish
more
if
they
avoid
showing
resentment
and
strive
for
harmony
i
shall
be
ready
to
forget
the
past
if
williams
will
for
my
position
as
your
wife
puts
me
beyond
the
reach
of
her
criticism
she
a
lively
little
thing
in
her
way
and
her
husband
seems
to
understand
about
investments
and
how
to
get
ahead
they
went
direct
to
washington
without
stopping
at
benham
it
was
understood
that
the
new
session
of
congress
was
to
be
very
short
and
they
were
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
present
themselves
in
an
official
capacity
at
the
capital
as
a
conclusion
to
their
honeymoon
before
settling
down
at
home
selma
found
a
letter
from
miss
bailey
containing
the
news
that
pauline
littleton
had
accepted
the
presidency
of
wetmore
college
the
buildings
of
which
were
now
practically
completed
selma
gasped
as
she
read
this
she
had
long
ago
decided
that
her
studies
were
unpractical
and
that
pauline
was
doomed
to
teach
small
classes
all
her
days
a
task
for
which
she
was
doubtless
well
fitted
she
resented
the
selection
for
in
her
opinion
pauline
lacked
the
imaginative
talent
of
wilbur
and
yet
shared
his
subjective
unenthusiastic
ways
more
than
once
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
the
presidency
of
wetmore
was
the
place
of
all
others
for
which
she
herself
was
fitted
indeed
until
lyons
had
offered
himself
she
had
cherished
in
her
inner
consciousness
the
hope
that
the
course
of
events
might
demonstrate
that
she
was
the
proper
person
to
direct
the
energies
of
this
new
medium
for
the
higher
education
of
women
it
irritated
her
to
think
that
an
institution
founded
by
benham
philanthropy
and
which
would
be
a
vital
influence
in
the
development
of
benham
womanhood
should
be
under
the
control
of
one
who
was
hostile
to
american
theories
and
methods
selma
felt
so
strongly
on
the
subject
that
she
thought
of
airing
her
objections
in
a
letter
to
flagg
the
donor
but
she
concluded
to
suspend
her
strictures
until
her
return
to
benham
she
sent
however
to
miss
bailey
who
was
now
regularly
attached
to
one
of
the
benham
newspapers
notes
for
an
article
which
should
deplore
the
choice
by
the
trustees
of
one
who
was
unfamiliar
and
presumably
out
of
sympathy
with
benham
thought
and
impulse
selma
emotions
on
her
arrival
in
washington
were
very
different
from
those
which
she
had
experienced
in
new
york
as
the
bride
of
littleton
then
she
had
been
unprepared
for
dazed
and
offended
by
what
she
saw
now
though
she
mentally
assumed
that
the
capital
was
the
parade
ground
of
american
ideas
and
principles
she
felt
not
merely
no
surprise
at
the
august
appearance
of
the
wide
avenues
but
she
was
eagerly
on
the
lookout
as
they
drove
from
the
station
to
the
hotel
for
signs
of
social
development
the
aphorism
which
she
had
supplied
to
her
husband
that
the
american
people
prefer
to
have
their
representatives
live
comfortably
dwelt
in
her
thoughts
and
was
a
solace
to
her
despite
her
new
york
experience
she
had
the
impression
that
the
doors
of
every
house
in
washington
would
fly
open
at
her
approach
as
the
wife
of
a
congressman
she
did
not
formulate
her
anticipations
as
to
her
reception
but
she
entertained
a
general
expectation
that
their
presence
would
be
acknowledged
as
public
officials
in
a
notable
way
she
dressed
herself
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
at
the
hotel
with
some
showiness
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
flattering
emergencies
she
had
said
little
to
her
husband
on
the
subject
for
she
had
already
discovered
that
though
he
was
ambitious
that
they
should
appear
well
he
was
disposed
to
leave
the
management
of
social
concerns
to
her
his
information
had
been
limited
to
bidding
her
come
prepared
for
the
reception
to
be
given
at
the
white
house
at
the
reassembling
of
congress
selma
had
brought
her
for
this
and
was
looking
forward
to
it
as
a
gala
occasion
the
hotel
was
very
crowded
and
selma
became
aware
that
many
of
the
guests
were
the
wives
and
daughters
of
other
congressmen
who
seemed
to
be
in
the
same
predicament
as
herself
that
is
without
anyone
to
speak
to
and
waiting
in
their
best
clothes
for
something
to
happen
lyons
knew
a
few
of
them
and
was
making
acquaintances
in
the
corridors
with
some
of
whom
he
exchanged
an
introduction
of
wives
as
she
successively
met
these
other
women
selma
perceived
that
no
one
of
them
was
better
dressed
than
herself
and
she
reflected
with
pleasure
that
they
would
doubtless
be
available
allies
in
her
crusade
against
frivolity
and
exclusiveness
presently
she
set
out
with
her
husband
to
survey
the
sights
of
the
city
naturally
their
first
visit
was
to
the
capitol
in
the
presence
of
which
selma
clutched
his
arm
in
the
pride
of
her
patriotism
and
of
her
pleasure
that
he
was
to
be
one
of
the
makers
of
history
within
its
splendid
precincts
the
sight
of
the
stately
houses
of
congress
superbly
dominated
by
their
imposing
dome
made
them
both
walk
proudly
lost
save
for
occasional
vivid
phrases
of
admiration
in
the
contemplation
of
their
own
possible
future
what
greater
earthly
prize
for
man
than
political
distinction
among
a
people
capable
of
monuments
like
this
what
grander
arena
for
a
woman
eager
to
demonstrate
truth
and
promote
righteousness
there
was
of
course
too
much
to
see
for
any
one
visit
they
went
up
to
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
looked
down
on
the
theatre
of
lyons
impending
activities
he
was
to
take
his
seat
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
as
one
of
the
minority
party
but
a
strong
vigorous
minority
selma
pictured
him
standing
in
the
aisle
and
uttering
ringing
words
of
denunciation
against
corporate
monopolies
and
the
money
power
i
shall
come
up
here
and
listen
to
you
often
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
if
you
speak
loud
enough
so
that
the
public
can
hear
you
she
said
glancing
at
the
line
of
galleries
which
she
saw
in
her
mind
eye
crowded
with
spectators
you
must
make
a
long
speech
very
soon
that
is
very
unlikely
indeed
they
tell
me
a
new
member
rarely
gets
a
chance
to
be
heard
answered
lyons
but
they
will
hear
you
you
have
something
to
say
lyons
squeezed
her
hand
her
words
nourished
the
same
hope
in
his
own
breast
i
shall
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
obtain
recognition
and
to
give
utterance
to
my
opinions
oh
yes
i
shall
expect
you
to
speak
i
am
counting
on
that
on
their
way
down
they
scanned
with
interest
the
statues
and
portraits
of
distinguished
statesmen
and
heroes
and
the
representations
of
famous
episodes
in
american
history
with
which
the
walls
of
the
landings
and
the
rotunda
are
lined
some
day
you
will
be
here
said
selma
i
wonder
who
will
paint
you
or
make
your
bust
i
have
often
thought
she
added
wistfully
that
if
i
had
given
my
mind
to
it
i
could
have
modelled
well
in
clay
some
day
i
try
it
would
be
interesting
would
it
to
have
you
here
in
marble
with
the
inscription
underneath
of
the
honorable
james
lyons
sculptured
by
his
wife
lyons
laughed
but
he
was
pleased
you
are
making
rapid
strides
my
dear
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
if
my
bust
or
portrait
ever
is
here
i
shall
owe
my
success
largely
to
your
devotion
and
good
sense
i
felt
certain
of
it
before
but
our
honeymoon
has
proved
to
me
that
we
were
meant
for
one
another
yes
i
think
we
were
and
i
like
to
hear
you
say
i
have
good
sense
that
is
what
i
pride
myself
on
as
a
wife
on
their
return
to
the
hotel
selma
was
annoyed
to
find
that
no
one
but
a
member
of
her
husband
congressional
delegation
had
called
she
had
hoped
to
find
that
their
presence
in
washington
was
known
and
appreciated
it
seemed
to
her
moreover
that
they
were
not
treated
at
the
hotel
with
the
deference
she
had
supposed
would
be
accorded
to
them
to
be
sure
equality
was
of
the
essence
of
american
doctrine
nevertheless
she
had
anticipated
that
the
official
representatives
of
the
people
would
be
made
much
of
and
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
the
world
if
not
by
direct
attention
by
being
pointed
out
and
looked
at
admiringly
still
as
lyons
showed
no
signs
of
disappointment
she
forbore
to
express
her
own
perplexity
which
was
temporarily
relieved
by
an
invitation
from
him
to
drive
the
atmosphere
was
mild
enough
for
an
open
carriage
and
selma
appetite
for
processional
effect
derived
some
crumbs
of
comfort
from
the
process
of
showing
herself
in
a
barouche
by
the
side
of
her
husband
they
proceeded
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
capitol
and
after
surveying
the
outside
of
the
white
house
drove
along
the
avenues
and
circles
occupied
by
private
residences
selma
noticed
that
these
houses
though
attractive
were
less
magnificent
and
conspicuous
than
many
of
those
in
new
york
more
like
her
own
in
benham
and
she
pictured
as
their
occupants
the
families
of
the
public
men
of
the
country
a
society
of
their
wives
and
daughters
living
worthily
energetically
and
with
becoming
stateliness
yet
at
the
same
time
rebuking
by
their
example
frivolity
and
rampant
luxury
she
observed
with
satisfaction
the
passage
of
a
number
of
private
carriages
and
that
their
occupants
were
stylishly
clad
she
reflected
that
as
the
wife
of
a
congressman
her
place
was
among
them
and
she
was
glad
that
they
recognized
the
claims
of
social
development
so
far
as
to
dress
well
and
live
in
comfort
before
starting
she
had
herself
fastened
a
bunch
of
red
roses
at
her
waist
as
a
contribution
to
her
picturesqueness
as
a
public
woman
while
she
was
thus
absorbed
in
speculation
not
altogether
free
from
worrying
suspicions
in
spite
of
her
mental
vision
as
to
the
occupants
of
these
private
residences
she
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
as
a
jaunty
victoria
passed
by
them
and
she
turned
her
head
in
an
eager
attempt
to
ascertain
if
her
surprise
and
annoyance
were
the
other
vehicle
was
moving
rapidly
but
a
similar
curiosity
impelled
one
of
its
occupants
to
look
hack
also
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
met
it
she
i
thought
it
was
who
my
dear
said
lyons
flossy
williams
gregory
williams
i
wonder
she
added
in
a
severe
tone
what
she
is
doing
here
and
how
she
happens
to
be
associating
with
these
people
that
was
a
private
carriage
williams
has
a
number
of
friends
in
washington
i
imagine
i
thought
it
likely
that
he
would
be
here
that
was
another
proof
of
your
good
sense
selma
deciding
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
to
ignore
your
disagreement
with
his
wife
yes
i
know
i
shall
treat
her
civilly
but
my
heart
will
be
broken
james
if
i
find
that
washington
is
like
new
york
in
what
respect
if
i
find
that
the
people
in
these
houses
lead
exclusive
godless
lives
it
would
tempt
me
almost
to
despair
of
our
country
she
exclaimed
with
tragic
emphasis
i
do
understand
about
social
matters
selma
i
must
leave
those
to
you
but
he
added
showing
that
he
shrewdly
realized
the
cause
of
her
anguish
better
than
she
did
herself
as
soon
as
we
get
better
acquainted
i
sure
you
will
find
that
we
shall
get
ahead
and
that
you
will
be
able
to
hold
your
own
with
anybody
however
exclusive
selma
colored
at
the
unflattering
simplicity
of
his
deduction
i
desire
to
hold
my
own
with
people
of
that
sort
i
despise
them
i
know
hold
your
own
i
mean
among
people
of
the
right
sort
by
force
of
sound
ideas
and
principles
the
men
and
women
of
he
continued
with
melodious
asseveration
are
the
of
those
who
built
the
splendid
halls
we
visited
this
morning
as
a
monument
to
our
nation
love
of
truth
and
righteousness
a
few
frivolous
worldly
minded
spirits
are
not
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
whom
we
look
for
our
encouragement
and
support
assuredly
answered
selma
with
eagerness
it
is
difficult
though
not
to
get
discouraged
at
times
by
the
behavior
of
those
who
ought
to
aid
instead
of
hinder
our
progress
as
a
nation
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
in
wrapt
meditation
then
she
asked
did
you
expect
that
more
notice
would
be
taken
of
our
arrival
in
what
way
in
some
way
befitting
a
member
of
congress
lyons
laughed
my
dear
selma
i
am
one
new
congressman
among
several
hundred
what
did
you
expect
that
the
president
and
his
wife
would
come
and
take
us
to
drive
of
course
not
she
paused
a
moment
then
she
said
i
suppose
that
as
you
are
not
on
the
side
of
the
administration
we
can
not
expect
much
notice
to
be
taken
of
us
until
you
speak
in
the
house
i
will
try
not
to
be
too
ambitious
for
you
james
but
it
would
be
easier
to
be
patient
she
concluded
with
her
look
if
i
were
not
beginning
to
fear
that
this
city
also
may
be
contaminated
just
as
new
york
is
chapter
vi
the
incidents
of
the
next
two
days
previous
to
her
attendance
at
the
evening
reception
at
the
white
house
restored
selma
equanimity
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
present
at
the
opening
ceremonies
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
beholding
her
husband
take
the
oath
of
office
she
was
proud
of
lyons
as
she
looked
down
on
him
from
the
gallery
standing
in
the
aisle
by
his
allotted
seat
he
was
holding
an
improvised
reception
for
a
number
of
his
colleagues
showed
themselves
desirous
to
make
his
acquaintance
she
noticed
that
he
appeared
already
on
familiar
terms
with
some
of
his
that
he
drew
men
or
was
drawn
aside
for
whispered
confidences
that
he
joked
knowingly
with
others
and
that
always
as
he
chatted
his
large
round
smooth
face
relieved
by
its
chin
beard
wore
an
aspect
of
bland
dignity
and
shrewd
reserve
wisdom
it
pleased
her
to
be
assisting
at
the
dedication
of
a
fresh
page
of
national
history
a
page
yet
unwritten
but
on
which
she
hoped
that
her
own
name
would
be
inscribed
sooner
or
later
by
those
who
should
seek
to
trace
the
complete
causes
of
her
husband
usefulness
and
genius
another
source
of
satisfaction
was
the
visit
paid
them
the
day
before
at
the
hotel
by
one
of
the
united
states
senators
from
their
own
state
calkins
the
two
political
parties
in
their
own
state
were
so
evenly
divided
that
one
of
the
senators
in
office
happened
to
be
a
republican
and
his
colleague
a
democrat
calkins
belonged
to
her
party
yet
he
suggested
that
they
might
enjoy
a
private
audience
with
the
president
with
whom
notwithstanding
political
differences
of
opinion
calkins
was
on
friendly
terms
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
which
selma
aspired
to
and
the
experience
did
much
to
lighten
her
heart
she
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
seeing
guarded
doors
open
at
their
approach
and
of
finding
herself
shaking
hands
with
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
nation
at
a
special
interview
the
president
was
very
affable
and
was
manifestly
aware
of
lyons
triumph
at
the
expense
of
his
own
party
and
of
his
consequent
political
importance
he
treated
the
matter
banteringly
and
selma
was
pleased
at
her
ability
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
his
persiflage
and
to
reciprocate
in
her
opinion
solemnity
would
have
been
more
consistent
with
his
position
as
the
official
representative
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
his
jocose
manifestations
at
a
time
when
serious
conversation
seemed
to
be
in
order
was
a
disappointment
and
tended
to
confirm
her
previous
distrust
of
him
as
the
leader
of
the
opposite
party
she
had
hoped
he
would
broach
some
vital
topics
of
political
interest
and
that
she
would
have
the
opportunity
to
give
expression
to
her
own
views
in
regard
to
public
questions
nevertheless
as
the
president
saw
fit
to
be
humorous
she
was
glad
that
she
understood
how
to
meet
and
answer
his
bantering
sallies
she
felt
sure
that
lyons
were
he
ever
to
occupy
this
dignified
office
would
refrain
from
levity
but
she
bore
in
mind
also
the
policy
of
conciliation
which
she
had
learned
from
her
husband
and
concealed
her
true
impressions
she
noticed
that
both
lyons
and
calkins
forebore
to
show
dissatisfaction
and
she
reflected
that
though
the
president
tone
was
light
there
was
nothing
else
in
his
appearance
or
bearing
to
convict
him
of
sympathy
with
lack
of
enthusiasm
and
with
cynicism
it
would
have
destroyed
all
the
enjoyment
of
her
interview
had
she
been
forced
to
conclude
that
a
man
who
did
not
take
himself
and
his
duties
seriously
could
be
elected
president
of
the
united
states
she
was
not
willing
to
believe
this
but
her
suspicions
were
so
far
aroused
that
she
congratulated
herself
that
her
political
opponents
were
responsible
for
his
election
nevertheless
she
was
delighted
by
the
distinction
of
the
private
audience
and
by
the
episode
at
its
close
which
gave
her
opportunity
to
show
her
individuality
said
the
president
gallantly
as
she
was
taking
leave
will
you
permit
me
to
congratulate
congressman
lyons
on
his
good
fortune
in
the
affairs
of
the
heart
as
well
as
in
politics
if
you
say
things
like
that
president
interjected
lyons
you
will
turn
her
head
she
will
become
a
republican
and
then
where
should
i
be
while
she
perceived
that
the
president
was
still
inclined
to
levity
the
compliment
pleased
selma
yet
though
she
appreciated
that
her
husband
was
merely
humoring
him
by
his
reply
she
did
not
like
the
suggestion
that
any
flattery
could
affect
her
principles
she
shook
her
head
coquettishly
and
said
james
i
sure
the
president
thinks
too
well
of
american
women
to
believe
that
any
admiration
however
gratifying
would
make
me
lukewarm
in
devotion
to
my
party
this
speech
appeared
to
her
apposite
and
called
for
and
she
departed
in
high
spirits
which
were
illuminated
by
the
thought
that
the
administration
was
not
wholly
to
be
trusted
on
the
following
evening
selma
went
to
the
reception
at
the
white
house
the
process
of
arrival
was
trying
to
her
patience
for
they
were
obliged
to
await
their
turn
in
the
long
file
of
carriages
she
could
not
but
approve
of
the
democratic
character
of
the
entertainment
which
anyone
who
desired
to
behold
and
shake
hands
with
the
chief
magistrate
was
free
to
attend
still
it
again
crossed
her
mind
that
as
an
official
wife
she
ought
to
have
been
given
precedence
their
turn
to
alight
came
at
last
and
they
took
their
places
in
the
procession
of
visitors
on
its
way
through
the
east
room
to
the
spot
where
the
president
and
his
wife
assisted
by
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
cabinet
were
submitting
to
the
ordeal
of
receiving
the
nation
there
was
a
veritable
crush
in
which
there
was
every
variety
of
evening
toilette
a
display
essentially
in
keeping
with
the
doctrines
which
selma
felt
that
she
stood
for
she
took
occasion
to
rejoice
in
lyons
ear
at
the
realization
of
her
anticipations
in
this
respect
at
the
same
time
she
was
agreeably
stimulated
by
the
belief
that
her
wedding
dress
was
sumptuous
and
stylish
and
her
appearance
striking
her
hair
had
been
dressed
as
elaborately
as
possible
she
wore
all
her
jewelry
and
she
carried
a
bouquet
of
costly
roses
her
wish
was
to
regard
the
function
as
the
height
of
social
demonstration
and
she
had
spared
no
pains
to
make
herself
effective
she
had
esteemed
it
her
duty
to
do
so
both
as
a
congressman
wife
and
as
a
champion
of
moral
and
democratic
ideas
the
crowd
was
oppressive
and
three
times
the
train
of
her
dress
was
stepped
on
to
her
discomfiture
amid
the
sea
of
faces
she
recognized
a
few
of
the
people
she
had
seen
at
the
hotel
it
struck
her
that
no
one
of
the
women
was
dressed
so
elegantly
as
herself
an
observation
which
cheered
her
and
yet
was
not
without
its
thorn
but
the
music
the
lights
and
the
variegated
movement
of
the
scene
kept
her
senses
absorbed
and
interfered
with
introspection
until
at
last
they
were
close
to
the
receiving
party
selma
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
president
expecting
recognition
like
her
husband
the
president
possessed
a
gift
of
faces
and
the
faculty
of
rallying
all
his
energies
to
the
important
task
of
remembering
who
people
were
an
usher
asked
and
announced
the
names
but
the
chief
magistrate
perceptions
were
kept
hard
at
work
his
how
do
you
do
congressman
lyons
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
here
lyons
were
uttered
with
a
smiling
spontaneity
which
to
his
own
soul
meant
a
momentary
agreeable
relaxation
of
the
nerves
of
memory
resembling
the
easy
flourish
with
which
a
gymnast
engaged
in
lifting
heavy
weights
encounters
a
wooden
but
though
his
eyes
and
voice
were
flattering
selma
had
barely
completed
the
little
bob
of
a
courtesy
which
accompanied
her
act
of
shaking
hands
when
she
discovered
that
the
machinery
of
the
national
custom
was
not
to
halt
on
their
account
and
that
she
must
proceed
without
being
able
to
renew
the
half
flirtatious
interview
of
the
previous
day
she
proceeded
to
courtesy
to
the
president
wife
and
to
the
row
of
wives
of
members
of
the
cabinet
who
were
assisting
before
she
could
adequately
observe
them
she
found
herself
beyond
and
a
part
once
more
of
a
heterogeneous
crush
the
current
of
which
she
aimlessly
followed
on
her
husband
arm
she
was
suspicious
of
the
device
of
courtesying
why
had
not
the
wife
and
the
cabinet
ladies
shaken
hands
with
her
and
given
her
an
opportunity
to
make
their
acquaintance
could
it
be
that
the
administration
was
aping
foreign
manners
and
adopting
effete
and
aristocratic
usages
what
do
we
do
now
she
asked
of
lyons
as
they
drifted
along
i
like
to
find
horace
elton
and
introduce
him
to
you
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
further
on
just
before
we
reached
the
president
horace
knows
all
the
ropes
and
can
tell
us
who
everybody
is
selma
had
heard
her
husband
refer
to
horace
elton
on
several
occasions
in
terms
of
respectful
and
somewhat
mysterious
consideration
she
had
gathered
in
a
general
way
that
he
was
a
far
reaching
and
formidable
power
in
matters
political
and
financial
besides
being
the
president
and
active
organizer
of
the
energetic
corporation
known
as
the
consumers
gas
light
company
of
their
own
state
as
they
proceeded
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
alert
for
a
man
described
by
lyons
as
short
heavily
built
and
neat
looking
with
small
side
whiskers
and
a
expression
when
they
were
not
far
from
the
door
of
exit
from
the
east
room
some
one
on
the
edge
of
the
procession
accosted
her
husband
who
drew
her
after
him
in
that
direction
selma
found
herself
in
a
sort
of
eddy
occupied
by
half
a
dozen
people
engaged
in
observing
the
passing
show
and
in
the
presence
of
and
gregory
williams
it
was
williams
who
had
diverted
them
he
now
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
her
exclaiming
my
wife
insisted
that
she
had
met
you
driving
with
some
one
she
believed
to
be
your
husband
i
had
heard
that
congressman
lyons
was
on
his
bridal
tour
and
now
everything
is
clear
flossy
you
were
right
as
usual
and
it
seems
that
our
hearty
congratulations
are
in
order
to
two
old
friends
williams
spoke
with
his
customary
contagious
confidence
selma
noted
that
he
was
stouter
and
that
his
hair
was
becomingly
streaked
with
gray
had
not
her
attention
been
on
the
lookout
for
his
wife
she
might
have
noticed
that
his
eye
wore
a
restless
strained
expression
despite
his
august
banker
manner
and
showy
gallantry
she
did
observe
that
the
moment
he
had
made
way
for
flossy
he
turned
to
lyons
and
began
to
talk
to
him
in
a
subdued
tone
under
the
guise
of
watching
the
procession
the
two
women
confronted
each
other
with
spontaneous
forgetfulness
of
the
past
there
was
a
shade
of
haughtiness
in
selma
greeting
she
was
prepared
to
respect
her
husband
policy
and
to
ignore
the
circumstances
under
which
they
had
parted
but
she
wished
flossy
to
understand
that
this
was
an
act
of
condescension
on
her
part
as
a
congressman
wife
whose
important
social
status
was
beyond
question
she
was
so
thoroughly
imbued
with
this
sense
of
her
indisputable
superiority
that
she
readily
mistook
flossy
affability
for
fawning
whereas
that
young
ingenuous
friendliness
was
the
result
of
a
warning
sentence
from
gregory
when
selma
and
her
husband
were
seen
approaching
keep
a
check
on
your
tongue
floss
this
statesman
with
a
beard
like
a
goat
is
likely
to
have
a
political
future
i
felt
sure
it
was
you
the
other
day
flossy
said
with
smiling
sprightliness
but
i
had
not
heard
of
your
marriage
to
mr
lyons
we
were
married
at
benham
six
weeks
ago
we
are
to
live
in
benham
we
have
bought
the
house
there
which
belonged
to
parsons
we
have
just
returned
from
visiting
the
superb
scenery
of
the
yosemite
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
it
made
me
prouder
than
ever
of
my
country
if
congressman
lyons
had
not
been
obliged
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
congress
we
should
have
spent
our
honeymoon
in
europe
gregory
and
i
passed
last
summer
abroad
yachting
we
crossed
on
a
steamer
and
had
our
yacht
meet
us
there
is
it
a
jam
there
seem
to
be
a
great
many
people
i
suppose
you
came
on
from
new
york
on
purpose
for
this
reception
mercy
no
we
are
staying
with
friends
and
we
had
intended
to
come
but
we
had
been
dining
out
and
were
dressed
so
we
thought
we
drop
in
and
show
our
patriotism
it
destruction
to
clothes
and
i
glad
i
have
worn
my
best
selma
perceived
flossy
eye
making
a
note
of
her
own
elaborate
costume
and
the
disagreeable
suspicion
that
she
was
overdressed
reasserted
itself
she
had
already
observed
that
williams
toilette
though
stylish
was
comparatively
simple
how
could
one
be
overdressed
on
such
an
occasion
what
more
suitable
time
for
an
american
woman
to
wear
her
choicest
apparel
than
when
paying
her
respects
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
she
noticed
that
flossy
seemed
unduly
at
her
ease
as
though
the
importance
of
the
ceremony
was
lost
on
her
and
that
they
group
of
people
with
whom
flossy
had
been
talking
and
who
stood
a
little
apart
were
obviously
indulging
in
quiet
mirth
at
the
expense
of
some
of
those
in
the
procession
are
the
friends
with
whom
you
are
staying
connected
with
the
government
selma
asked
airily
official
people
goodness
no
but
i
can
point
out
to
you
who
everybody
is
for
we
have
been
in
washington
frequently
during
the
last
three
sessions
gregory
has
to
run
over
here
on
business
every
now
and
then
and
i
almost
always
come
with
him
is
the
opportunity
to
see
the
queer
people
in
all
their
glory
the
woolly
curiosities
as
gregory
calls
them
and
a
sprinkling
of
the
real
celebrities
too
she
added
selma
inquiry
had
been
put
with
a
view
to
satisfy
herself
that
flossy
friends
were
mere
civilians
but
she
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
be
enlightened
as
to
the
names
of
her
though
she
resented
flossy
flippant
tone
regarding
the
character
of
the
entertainment
while
she
listened
to
the
breezy
running
commentary
by
which
flossy
proceeded
to
identify
for
her
benefit
the
conspicuous
figures
in
the
procession
she
nursed
her
offended
sensibilities
i
should
suppose
she
said
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
that
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
everybody
worth
knowing
would
be
present
flossy
gave
selma
one
of
her
quick
glances
she
had
not
forgotten
the
past
nor
her
discovery
of
the
late
littleton
real
grievance
against
her
and
the
world
nor
did
she
consider
that
her
caveat
debarred
her
from
the
amusement
of
worrying
the
wife
of
the
hon
james
lyons
provided
it
could
be
done
by
means
of
the
truth
ingenuously
uttered
she
said
with
a
confidential
smile
the
important
and
the
interesting
political
people
have
other
opportunities
to
meet
one
another
at
dinner
parties
and
less
promiscuous
entertainments
than
this
and
the
washington
people
have
other
opportunities
to
meet
them
of
course
the
president
is
a
dear
and
everyone
makes
a
point
of
attending
a
public
reception
once
in
a
while
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
exactly
an
edifying
society
event
for
instance
notice
the
woman
in
the
pomegranate
velvet
with
two
diamond
sprays
in
her
hair
that
the
wife
of
senator
colman
his
child
wife
so
they
call
her
she
came
to
washington
six
years
ago
as
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
house
from
one
of
the
wild
and
woolly
states
and
was
notorious
then
in
the
hotel
corridors
on
account
of
her
ringletty
raven
hair
and
the
profusion
of
rings
she
wore
she
used
to
make
eyes
at
the
hotel
guests
and
romp
with
her
husband
friends
in
the
hotel
parlors
which
was
the
theatre
of
her
social
activities
her
husband
died
and
a
year
ago
she
married
old
senator
colman
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
and
one
of
the
very
rich
and
influential
men
in
the
senate
now
she
has
developed
social
ambition
and
is
anxious
to
entertain
they
have
hired
a
large
house
for
the
winter
and
are
building
a
larger
one
as
polsen
that
was
her
first
husband
name
she
was
invited
nowhere
except
to
wholesale
official
functions
like
this
the
wife
of
a
united
states
senator
with
plenty
of
money
can
generally
attract
a
following
she
is
somebody
and
it
happens
that
people
are
amused
by
cohnan
eccentricities
she
still
overdresses
and
makes
eyes
and
she
nudges
those
who
sit
next
her
at
table
but
she
is
says
whatever
comes
into
her
head
and
has
a
strong
sense
of
humor
so
she
is
getting
on
getting
on
among
society
people
said
selma
drily
flossy
eyes
twinkled
society
people
is
the
generic
name
used
for
them
in
the
newspapers
i
mean
that
she
is
making
friends
among
the
women
who
live
in
the
quarter
where
i
passed
you
the
other
day
selma
frowned
it
is
not
necessary
i
imagine
to
make
friends
of
that
class
in
order
to
have
influence
in
washington
the
best
kind
of
influence
i
can
readily
believe
that
people
of
that
sort
would
interest
most
of
our
public
women
very
little
very
likely
i
do
think
you
quite
understand
me
lyons
or
we
are
talking
at
cross
purposes
what
i
was
trying
to
make
clear
is
that
political
and
social
prominence
in
washington
are
by
no
means
synonimous
of
course
everyone
connected
with
the
government
who
desires
to
frequent
washington
society
and
is
socially
available
is
received
with
open
arms
but
if
people
are
not
socially
available
it
by
no
means
follows
that
they
are
able
to
command
social
recognition
merely
because
they
hold
political
office
except
perhaps
in
the
case
of
wives
of
the
cabinet
of
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
or
of
rich
and
influential
senators
where
a
woman
is
absolutely
bent
on
success
and
takes
pains
i
refer
particularly
to
the
wives
because
a
single
man
if
he
is
reasonably
presentable
and
ambitious
can
go
about
more
or
less
even
if
he
is
a
little
rough
for
men
are
apt
to
be
scarce
but
the
line
is
drawn
on
the
women
unless
they
are
er
really
important
and
have
to
be
tolerated
for
official
reasons
now
every
woman
who
is
not
as
the
diplomats
say
anywhere
else
is
apt
to
attend
the
president
reception
in
all
her
finery
and
that
why
i
suggested
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
exactly
an
edifying
social
event
it
amusing
to
come
here
now
and
then
just
as
it
amusing
to
go
to
a
menagerie
you
see
what
i
mean
do
you
flossy
asked
plying
her
feathery
fan
with
blithe
nonchalance
and
looking
into
her
companion
face
with
an
innocent
air
i
understand
perfectly
and
who
are
these
people
who
draw
the
line
it
sometimes
happens
continued
flossy
abstractedly
without
appearing
to
hear
this
inquiry
that
they
improve
after
they
been
in
washington
a
few
years
take
baker
the
secretary
of
the
wife
receiving
when
her
husband
came
to
washington
three
years
ago
she
had
the
social
adaptability
of
a
solemn
horse
but
she
persevered
and
learned
and
now
as
a
cabinet
lady
she
unbends
and
is
no
longer
afraid
of
compromising
her
dignity
by
wearing
becoming
clothes
and
smiling
occasionally
but
you
were
asking
who
the
people
are
who
draw
the
line
the
nice
people
here
just
as
everywhere
else
the
people
who
have
been
well
educated
and
have
fine
sensibilities
and
who
believe
in
modesty
and
unselfishness
and
thorough
ways
of
doing
things
you
must
know
the
sort
of
people
i
mean
some
of
them
make
too
much
of
mere
manners
but
as
a
class
they
are
able
to
draw
the
line
because
they
draw
it
in
favor
of
distinction
of
character
as
opposed
to
what
shall
i
call
it
haphazard
ethics
and
social
deportment
flossy
spoke
with
the
artless
prattle
of
one
seeking
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
a
by
explaining
the
existing
order
of
things
but
she
had
chosen
her
words
as
she
proceeded
with
special
reference
to
her
listener
case
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
to
suggest
that
she
was
trifling
with
the
feelings
of
the
wife
of
hon
james
lyons
but
to
selma
sensitive
ear
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
impertinent
and
unpatriotic
tirade
had
been
deliberately
aimed
at
her
the
closing
words
had
a
disagreeably
familiar
sound
save
that
they
fell
from
seemingly
friendly
lips
they
recalled
the
ban
which
flossy
had
hurled
at
her
at
the
close
of
their
last
meeting
the
ban
which
had
decided
her
to
declare
unwavering
hostility
against
social
exclusiveness
its
veiled
reiteration
now
made
her
nerves
tingle
but
the
personal
affront
stirred
her
less
than
the
conclusion
which
the
whole
of
flossy
commentary
suggested
that
washington
washington
the
of
american
ideals
was
contaminated
also
flossy
had
given
her
to
understand
that
the
houses
which
she
had
assumed
to
be
occupied
by
members
of
the
government
were
chiefly
the
residences
of
people
resembling
in
character
those
whom
she
had
disapproved
of
in
new
york
flossy
had
intimated
that
unless
a
woman
were
hand
in
glove
with
these
people
and
ready
to
lower
herself
to
their
standards
she
must
be
the
wife
of
a
rich
senator
to
be
tolerated
flossy
had
virtually
told
her
that
a
congressman
wife
was
nobody
could
this
be
true
the
bitterest
part
of
all
was
that
it
was
evident
flossy
spoke
with
the
assurance
of
one
uttering
familiar
truths
selma
felt
affronted
and
bitterly
disappointed
but
she
chose
to
meet
williams
innocent
affability
with
composure
to
let
her
see
that
she
disagreed
with
her
but
not
to
reveal
her
personal
irritation
she
must
consider
lyons
whose
swift
political
promotion
was
necessary
for
her
plans
it
was
important
that
he
should
become
rich
and
if
his
relations
with
the
firm
of
williams
van
horne
tended
to
that
end
no
personal
grievance
of
her
own
should
disturb
them
even
flossy
had
conceded
that
the
wives
of
the
highest
officials
could
not
be
ignored
i
fear
that
we
look
at
these
matters
from
too
different
a
standpoint
to
discuss
them
further
she
responded
with
an
effort
at
smiling
ease
evidently
you
do
not
appreciate
that
to
the
majority
of
the
strong
women
of
the
country
whose
husbands
have
been
sent
to
washington
as
members
of
the
government
social
interests
seem
trivial
compared
with
the
great
public
questions
they
are
required
to
consider
these
women
doubtless
feel
little
inclination
for
fashionable
and
or
frivolous
festivities
and
find
an
occasion
like
this
better
suited
to
their
conception
of
social
dignity
a
reply
by
flossy
to
this
speech
was
prevented
by
the
interruption
of
lyons
who
brought
up
horace
elton
for
introduction
to
his
wife
selma
knew
him
at
once
from
his
likeness
to
the
description
which
her
husband
had
given
he
was
portly
and
with
a
large
neck
a
strong
unemotional
face
and
small
side
whiskers
he
made
her
a
low
bow
and
after
a
few
moments
of
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
he
let
fall
a
complimentary
allusion
to
her
husband
oratorical
abilities
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
considered
lyons
marriage
as
a
wise
and
enviable
proceeding
he
invited
her
to
promenade
the
room
on
his
arm
elton
had
a
low
but
clear
and
dispassionate
voice
and
a
concise
utterance
his
remarks
gave
the
impression
that
he
could
impart
more
on
any
subject
if
he
chose
and
that
what
he
said
proceeded
from
a
reserve
fund
of
special
secret
knowledge
a
little
of
which
he
was
willing
to
confide
to
his
listener
he
enlightened
selma
in
a
few
words
as
to
a
variety
of
the
people
present
accompanying
his
identification
with
a
phrase
or
two
of
comprehensive
personal
detail
which
had
the
savor
of
being
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
the
lady
we
just
passed
lyons
is
the
wife
of
the
junior
senator
from
nevada
her
husband
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
stage
of
a
mining
town
theatrical
troupe
that
tall
man
with
the
profuse
wavy
hair
and
prominent
nose
is
congressman
ross
of
colorado
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
cattle
ranches
in
the
far
west
it
is
said
that
he
has
never
smoked
never
tasted
a
glass
of
liquor
and
never
gambled
in
his
life
in
the
course
of
these
remarks
elton
simply
stated
his
interesting
facts
without
comment
he
avoided
censorious
or
satirical
allusions
to
the
people
to
whom
he
called
selma
attention
on
the
contrary
his
observations
suggested
sympathetically
that
he
desired
to
point
out
to
her
the
interesting
personalities
of
the
capital
and
that
he
regarded
the
entertainment
as
an
occasion
to
behold
the
strong
men
and
women
of
the
country
in
their
lustre
and
dignity
as
they
passed
the
lady
in
pomegranate
velvet
selma
said
in
her
turn
that
is
colman
i
believe
senator
colman
child
wife
she
added
what
was
in
her
thoughts
i
understand
that
the
society
people
here
have
taken
her
up
yes
she
has
become
a
conspicuous
figure
in
washington
i
remember
her
lyons
when
she
was
addie
farr
before
she
married
congressman
polsen
of
kentucky
she
was
a
dashing
looking
girl
in
those
days
with
her
black
eyes
and
black
ringlets
i
remember
she
had
a
coltish
way
of
tossing
her
head
the
story
is
that
when
she
accepted
polsen
another
kentuckian
a
young
planter
who
was
in
love
with
her
drank
laudanum
now
as
you
say
she
is
being
taken
up
socially
and
her
husband
the
senator
is
very
proud
of
her
success
after
all
if
a
woman
is
ambitious
and
has
tact
what
can
she
ask
better
than
to
be
the
wife
of
a
united
states
senator
he
paused
a
moment
then
with
a
gallant
sidelong
glance
at
his
companion
resumed
in
a
concise
whisper
which
had
the
effect
of
a
disclosure
prophecies
especially
political
prophecies
are
dangerous
affairs
but
it
seems
to
me
not
improbable
that
before
many
years
have
passed
the
wife
of
senator
lyons
will
be
equally
prominent
be
as
conspicuous
socially
as
the
wife
of
senator
colman
selma
blushed
but
not
wholly
with
pleasure
socially
conspicuous
before
many
years
the
splendid
prophecy
which
went
beyond
the
limit
of
horace
elton
usual
caution
for
he
combined
the
faculty
of
habitual
discretion
with
his
chatty
proclivities
was
dimmed
for
selma
by
the
rasping
intimation
that
she
was
not
conspicuous
yet
worse
still
his
statement
shattered
the
hope
which
flossy
fluent
assertions
had
already
disturbed
that
she
was
to
find
in
washington
a
company
of
congenial
spirits
who
would
appreciate
her
at
her
full
value
forthwith
and
would
join
with
her
and
under
her
leadership
in
resisting
the
encroachments
of
women
of
the
stamp
of
williams
i
am
very
ambitious
for
my
husband
elton
and
of
course
i
have
hoped
do
hope
that
some
day
he
will
be
a
senator
what
you
said
just
now
as
to
the
power
of
his
voice
to
arouse
the
moral
enthusiasm
of
the
people
seemed
to
be
impressively
true
i
should
be
glad
to
be
a
senator
wife
for
for
i
wish
to
help
him
i
wish
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
the
principles
to
which
both
our
lives
are
dedicated
but
i
hoped
that
i
might
help
him
now
that
my
mission
might
be
clear
at
once
it
seems
according
to
you
that
a
congressman
wife
is
not
of
much
importance
that
her
hands
are
tied
practically
so
unless
unless
she
has
unusual
social
facility
and
the
right
sort
of
acquaintances
beauty
wealth
and
ambition
are
valuable
aids
but
i
always
am
sorry
for
women
who
come
here
without
friends
and
er
the
right
sort
of
introduction
at
any
rate
to
answer
your
question
frankly
a
congressman
wife
has
her
spurs
to
win
just
as
he
has
if
you
were
to
set
up
here
lyons
i
no
doubt
that
a
woman
of
your
attractions
and
capabilities
would
soon
make
a
niche
for
herself
you
have
had
social
experience
which
addie
farr
for
instance
was
without
i
lived
in
new
york
for
some
years
with
my
husband
littleton
so
i
have
a
number
of
eastern
acquaintances
i
remember
you
were
talking
with
gregory
williams
when
i
was
introduced
to
you
the
people
with
whom
she
is
staying
are
among
the
most
fashionable
in
washington
what
i
said
had
reference
to
the
wife
of
the
congressman
who
comes
to
washington
expecting
recognition
not
to
james
o
lyons
selma
bit
her
lip
she
recognized
the
of
her
cherished
expectations
she
was
not
prepared
to
acknowledge
formally
her
discomfiture
and
her
disappointment
but
she
believed
that
elton
though
a
plain
man
had
comprehensive
experience
and
that
he
spoke
with
shrewd
knowledge
of
the
situation
she
felt
sure
that
he
was
not
trying
to
deceive
or
humiliate
her
it
was
clear
that
washington
was
contaminated
also
i
dare
say
i
should
get
on
here
well
enough
after
a
time
though
i
should
find
difficulty
in
considering
that
it
was
right
to
give
so
much
time
to
merely
social
matters
but
lyons
and
i
have
already
decided
that
i
can
be
more
use
to
him
at
present
in
benham
there
i
feel
at
home
i
am
known
and
have
my
friends
and
there
i
have
important
work
literary
lectures
and
the
establishment
of
a
large
public
hospital
under
way
if
the
time
comes
as
you
kindly
predict
that
my
husband
is
chosen
a
united
states
senator
i
shall
be
glad
to
return
here
and
accept
the
responsibilities
of
our
position
but
i
warn
you
elton
i
warn
the
people
of
washington
she
added
with
a
wave
of
her
fan
while
her
eyes
sparkled
with
a
stern
light
that
when
i
am
one
of
their
leaders
i
shall
do
away
with
some
of
the
er
false
customs
of
the
present
administration
i
shall
insist
on
preserving
our
american
social
traditions
inviolate
here
was
the
grain
of
consolation
in
the
case
which
she
clutched
at
and
held
up
before
her
mind
eye
as
a
new
stimulus
to
her
patriotism
and
her
conscience
both
elton
and
flossy
had
indicated
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
exclusiveness
was
compelled
to
stop
in
its
haughty
disregard
of
democratic
ideals
there
were
certain
women
whom
the
people
who
worshipped
lack
of
enthusiasm
and
made
an
idol
of
cynicism
were
obliged
to
heed
and
recognize
they
might
be
able
to
ignore
the
intelligence
and
social
originality
of
a
congressman
wife
but
they
dared
not
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
the
wife
of
a
united
states
senator
and
if
a
woman
if
she
were
to
occupy
this
proud
position
what
a
satisfaction
it
would
be
to
assert
the
power
which
belonged
to
it
assert
it
in
behalf
of
the
cause
for
which
she
had
suffered
so
much
her
disappointment
tasted
bitterly
in
her
mouth
and
she
was
conscious
of
stern
revolt
but
the
new
hope
had
already
taken
possession
of
her
fancy
and
she
hastened
to
prove
it
by
the
ethical
standard
without
which
all
hopes
were
valueless
to
her
even
now
had
anyone
told
her
that
the
ruling
passion
of
her
life
was
to
be
wooed
and
made
much
of
by
the
very
people
she
professed
to
despise
she
would
have
spurned
the
accuser
as
a
malicious
slanderer
nor
indeed
would
it
have
been
wholly
true
williams
had
practically
told
her
this
at
their
last
meeting
in
new
york
and
its
utterance
had
convinced
her
on
the
contrary
of
repugnance
to
them
and
of
her
desire
to
be
the
leader
of
a
social
protest
against
them
now
here
in
washington
of
all
places
she
was
confronted
by
the
bitter
suggestion
that
she
was
without
allies
and
that
her
enemies
were
the
keepers
of
the
door
which
led
to
leadership
and
power
despondency
stared
her
in
the
face
but
a
splendid
possibility
aye
probability
was
left
she
would
not
forsake
her
principles
she
would
not
lower
her
flag
she
would
return
to
benham
washington
refused
her
homage
now
but
it
should
listen
to
her
and
bow
before
her
some
day
as
the
wife
of
one
of
the
real
leaders
of
the
state
whom
society
did
not
dare
to
ignore
chapter
vii
at
the
close
of
the
fortnight
of
her
stay
in
washington
subsequent
to
the
reception
at
the
white
house
selma
found
herself
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
as
when
she
parted
from
elton
during
this
fortnight
her
time
was
spent
either
in
sight
seeing
or
at
the
hotel
the
exercises
at
the
capitol
were
purely
formal
preliminary
to
a
speedy
adjournment
of
congress
consequently
her
husband
had
no
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
by
addressing
the
house
of
flossy
she
saw
nothing
though
the
two
men
had
several
meetings
apparently
both
lyons
and
williams
were
content
with
a
surface
reconciliation
between
their
wives
which
did
not
bar
family
intercourse
at
least
her
husband
made
no
suggestion
that
she
should
call
on
williams
and
flossy
cards
did
not
appear
beyond
making
the
acquaintance
of
a
few
more
wives
and
daughters
in
the
hotel
who
seemed
as
solitary
as
herself
selma
received
no
overtures
from
her
own
sex
she
knew
no
one
and
no
one
sought
her
out
or
paid
her
attention
she
still
saw
fit
to
believe
that
if
she
were
to
establish
herself
in
washington
and
devote
her
energies
to
rallying
these
wives
and
daughters
about
her
she
might
be
able
to
prove
that
flossy
and
elton
were
mistaken
but
she
realized
that
the
task
would
be
less
simple
than
she
had
anticipated
besides
she
yearned
to
return
to
benham
and
take
up
again
the
thread
of
active
life
there
benham
would
vindicate
her
and
some
day
benham
would
send
her
back
to
washington
to
claim
recognition
and
her
rightful
place
lyons
himself
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
and
found
congenial
occupation
in
visiting
with
his
wife
the
many
historical
objects
of
interest
and
in
chatting
in
various
hotel
corridors
with
the
public
men
of
the
country
his
associates
in
congress
his
solicitude
in
regard
to
the
account
which
williams
was
carrying
for
him
had
been
relieved
temporarily
by
an
upward
turn
in
the
stock
market
and
the
impending
prompt
adjournment
of
congress
had
saved
him
from
the
necessity
of
taking
action
in
regard
to
the
railroad
bill
which
williams
had
solicited
him
to
support
moreover
selma
had
repeated
to
him
horace
elton
prophecy
that
it
was
not
unlikely
that
some
day
he
would
become
senator
to
be
sure
he
recognized
that
a
remark
like
this
uttered
to
a
pretty
woman
by
an
astute
man
of
affairs
such
as
elton
was
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
there
was
no
vacancy
in
the
office
of
senator
from
his
state
and
none
was
likely
to
occur
at
the
present
time
if
one
should
occur
his
party
in
the
state
legislature
was
in
a
minority
hence
prophecy
was
obviously
a
random
proceeding
nevertheless
he
was
greatly
pleased
for
after
all
elton
would
scarcely
have
made
the
speech
had
he
not
been
genuinely
well
disposed
a
senatorship
was
one
of
the
great
prizes
of
political
life
and
one
of
the
noblest
positions
in
the
world
it
would
afford
him
a
golden
opportunity
to
leave
the
impress
of
his
convictions
on
national
legislation
and
defend
the
liberties
of
the
people
by
force
of
the
oratorical
gifts
which
he
possessed
elton
had
referred
to
these
gifts
in
complimentary
terms
was
it
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
elton
would
be
inclined
to
promote
his
political
fortunes
such
an
ally
would
be
invaluable
for
elton
was
a
growing
power
in
the
industrial
development
of
the
section
of
the
country
where
they
both
lived
he
had
continued
to
find
him
friendly
in
spite
of
his
own
antagonism
on
the
public
platform
to
corporate
power
a
favorite
and
conscientious
hope
in
his
political
outlook
was
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
capital
as
well
as
labor
believe
him
to
be
a
friend
without
alienating
either
that
he
might
obtain
support
at
the
polls
from
both
factions
and
thus
be
left
free
after
election
to
work
out
for
their
mutual
advantage
appropriate
legislation
he
had
avowed
himself
unmistakably
the
champion
of
popular
principles
in
order
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
common
people
but
his
policy
of
reasonable
conciliation
led
him
to
cast
sheep
eyes
at
vested
interests
when
he
could
do
so
without
exposing
himself
to
the
charge
of
inconsistency
many
of
his
friends
were
wealthy
men
and
his
private
ambition
was
to
amass
a
handsome
fortune
that
had
been
the
cause
of
his
speculative
ventures
in
local
enterprises
which
promised
large
returns
and
in
the
stock
market
horace
elton
was
a
friend
of
but
three
standing
one
of
the
men
who
had
consulted
him
occasionally
in
regard
to
legal
matters
since
he
had
become
a
corporation
attorney
he
admired
elton
strong
grasp
of
business
affairs
his
capacity
to
formulate
and
incubate
on
plans
of
magnitude
without
betraying
a
sign
of
his
intentions
and
his
power
to
act
with
lightning
despatch
and
overwhelming
vigor
when
the
moment
for
the
consummation
of
his
purposes
arrived
he
also
found
agreeable
elton
genial
ways
outside
of
business
hours
which
frequently
took
the
form
of
social
entertainment
at
which
expense
seemed
to
be
no
consideration
and
gastronomic
novelties
were
apt
to
be
presented
lyons
attended
one
of
these
private
banquets
while
in
washington
a
dinner
party
served
to
a
carefully
chosen
company
of
public
men
to
which
newspaper
scribes
were
unable
to
penetrate
this
same
genial
tendency
of
elton
to
make
himself
acceptable
to
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
took
the
form
of
a
gift
to
lyons
of
a
handsome
cameo
pin
which
he
presented
to
her
a
day
or
two
after
their
dialogue
at
the
president
reception
and
for
which
as
he
confidentially
informed
selma
he
had
been
seeking
a
suitable
wearer
ever
since
he
had
picked
it
up
in
an
store
in
brussels
the
previous
summer
on
the
day
of
their
departure
selma
as
she
took
a
last
look
from
the
car
window
at
the
capitol
and
the
washington
monument
said
to
her
husband
this
is
a
beautiful
city
worthy
in
many
respects
of
the
genius
of
the
american
people
but
i
never
wish
to
return
to
washington
until
you
are
united
states
senator
would
you
not
be
satisfied
with
justice
of
the
supreme
court
asked
lyons
gayly
i
should
prefer
senator
if
you
were
senator
you
could
probably
be
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
in
case
you
preferred
that
place
i
am
relying
on
you
james
to
bring
me
back
here
some
day
she
whispered
this
in
his
ear
as
they
sat
with
heads
close
together
looking
back
at
the
swiftly
receding
city
selma
hands
were
clasped
in
her
lap
and
she
seemed
to
her
lover
to
have
a
dreamy
air
an
air
suggesting
poetry
and
high
ethical
resolve
such
as
he
liked
to
associate
with
her
and
their
scheme
of
wedded
life
it
pleased
him
that
his
wife
should
feel
so
confident
that
the
future
had
in
store
for
him
this
great
prize
and
he
allowed
himself
to
yield
to
the
pathos
of
the
moment
and
whisper
in
reply
i
will
say
this
selma
my
business
affairs
look
more
favorable
and
if
nothing
unforeseen
happens
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
get
on
reasonably
fast
nowadays
in
order
to
be
a
united
states
senator
comfortably
it
is
desirable
in
the
first
place
to
have
abundant
means
yes
we
must
be
patient
and
and
with
your
help
dear
and
your
sympathy
we
may
live
to
see
what
you
desire
come
to
pass
of
course
my
ambition
is
to
be
senator
and
and
to
take
you
back
to
washington
as
a
senator
wife
selma
had
not
chosen
to
confide
to
lyons
in
set
terms
her
social
grievance
against
the
capital
of
her
country
but
she
was
glad
to
perceive
from
his
last
words
that
he
understood
she
was
not
satisfied
with
the
treatment
accorded
her
and
that
he
also
was
looking
forward
to
giving
her
a
position
which
would
enable
her
to
rebuke
the
ungodly
and
presumptuous
thank
you
james
she
answered
when
that
time
comes
we
shall
be
able
to
teach
them
a
number
of
things
for
the
present
though
i
feel
that
i
can
be
of
best
service
to
you
and
to
the
truths
which
we
are
living
for
by
interesting
myself
in
whatever
concerns
benham
we
believe
in
benham
and
benham
seems
inclined
to
believe
in
us
and
our
ideas
the
ensuing
year
passed
uneventfully
lyons
was
able
to
be
at
home
from
the
first
of
april
to
the
reassembling
of
congress
in
the
following
december
he
was
glad
to
give
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
handsome
establishment
he
resumed
the
tenor
of
his
professional
practice
feeling
that
as
a
married
citizen
he
had
become
of
more
importance
to
the
community
and
he
was
eager
to
bear
witness
to
his
sense
of
responsibility
he
took
a
more
active
part
in
soliciting
contributions
for
evangelizing
benighted
countries
and
he
consented
on
several
occasions
to
deliver
an
address
on
success
in
life
to
struggling
young
men
of
benham
and
the
surrounding
towns
his
easy
flow
of
words
his
dignity
and
his
sober
but
friendly
mien
made
him
a
favorite
with
audiences
and
constantly
broadened
his
circle
of
acquaintance
selma
on
her
side
took
up
the
organization
of
the
free
hospital
provided
by
parsons
her
husband
left
the
decision
of
all
but
legal
and
financial
questions
to
her
and
miss
luella
bailey
who
at
request
was
made
the
third
member
of
the
board
of
trustees
she
decided
to
call
in
a
committee
of
prominent
physicians
to
formulate
a
programme
of
procedure
in
matters
purely
medical
but
she
reserved
a
right
of
rejection
of
their
conclusions
and
she
insisted
on
the
recognition
of
certain
cardinal
principles
as
she
called
them
she
specified
that
no
one
school
of
medicine
should
dictate
the
policy
of
the
hospital
as
regards
the
treatment
of
patients
to
the
young
physician
whom
she
selected
to
assist
her
in
forming
this
administrative
board
she
stated
with
stern
emotion
i
do
not
intend
that
it
shall
be
possible
in
this
hospital
for
men
and
women
to
be
sacrificed
simply
because
doctors
are
unwilling
to
avail
themselves
of
the
latest
resources
of
brilliant
individual
discernment
i
know
what
it
means
to
see
a
beloved
one
die
who
might
have
been
saved
had
the
physician
in
charge
been
willing
to
try
new
expedients
the
doors
of
this
hospital
must
be
ever
open
to
rising
unconventional
talent
there
shall
be
no
creeds
nor
caste
of
medicine
here
she
also
specified
that
the
matron
in
charge
of
the
hospital
should
be
earle
whose
lack
of
trained
experience
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
her
maternal
humanitarian
spirit
as
selma
expressed
it
she
felt
confident
that
earle
would
choose
as
her
assistants
competent
and
skilful
persons
and
at
the
same
time
that
her
broad
point
of
view
and
sympathetic
instincts
would
not
allow
her
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
aspiring
but
technically
ignorant
ability
this
selection
of
earle
was
a
keen
pleasure
to
selma
it
seemed
to
her
an
ideal
selection
earle
was
no
longer
young
and
was
beginning
to
find
the
constant
labor
of
lecture
and
newspaper
work
exhausting
this
dignified
and
important
post
would
provide
her
with
a
permanent
income
and
would
afford
her
an
attractive
field
for
her
progressive
capabilities
selma
choice
of
young
ashmun
as
the
head
of
the
medical
board
was
due
to
a
statement
which
came
to
her
ears
that
he
was
reviled
by
some
of
the
physicians
of
benham
because
he
had
patented
certain
discoveries
of
his
own
instead
of
giving
his
the
benefit
of
his
knowledge
selma
was
prompt
to
detect
in
this
hostility
an
envious
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
regular
physicians
to
appropriate
the
fruits
of
individual
cleverness
and
to
repress
youthful
revolt
against
conventional
methods
ashmun
regarded
his
selection
as
the
professional
chief
of
this
new
institution
as
a
most
auspicious
occurrence
from
the
standpoint
of
his
personal
fortunes
he
was
ambitious
ardent
and
keen
to
attract
attention
with
an
abundant
fund
of
energy
and
a
nervous
driving
manner
he
was
besides
good
looking
and
fluent
and
he
quickly
perceived
the
drift
of
selma
intentions
in
regard
to
the
hospital
and
accommodated
himself
to
them
with
enthusiasm
they
afforded
him
the
very
opportunity
which
he
most
desired
the
chance
to
assert
himself
against
his
critics
and
to
obtain
public
notice
the
watchword
of
liberty
and
distrust
of
professional
canons
suited
his
purposes
and
his
mood
and
he
threw
himself
eagerly
into
the
work
of
carrying
out
selma
projects
as
a
result
of
the
selection
of
ashmun
and
of
the
other
members
of
the
administrative
board
who
were
chosen
with
a
view
to
their
availability
as
sympathetic
colleagues
letters
of
protest
from
several
physicians
appeared
in
the
newspapers
complaining
that
the
new
hospital
was
being
conducted
on
unscientific
and
shallow
principles
disapproved
of
by
the
leading
men
of
the
profession
selma
was
indignant
yet
thrilled
she
promptly
took
steps
to
refute
the
charge
and
explained
that
the
hostility
of
these
correspondents
proceeded
from
envy
and
reluctance
to
adopt
new
and
revolutionizing
expedients
through
the
aid
of
earle
and
miss
luella
bailey
a
column
in
the
benham
set
forth
the
merits
of
the
new
departure
in
medicine
which
was
cleverly
described
as
the
revolt
of
the
talented
young
men
of
the
profession
from
the
tyranny
of
their
conservative
elders
benham
became
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
merits
of
this
controversy
and
selma
received
a
number
of
anonymous
letters
through
the
post
approving
her
stand
in
behalf
of
advanced
independent
thought
among
the
physicians
who
were
opposed
to
her
administration
of
the
hospital
she
recognized
with
satisfaction
the
name
of
a
paget
who
as
she
happened
to
know
was
hallett
taylor
medical
adviser
another
matter
in
which
selma
became
interested
was
the
case
of
hamilton
she
was
a
woman
who
had
been
born
in
the
neighborhood
of
benham
but
had
lived
for
twenty
years
in
england
and
had
been
tried
in
england
by
due
process
of
law
for
the
murder
of
her
husband
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
life
some
of
the
people
of
the
state
who
had
followed
the
testimony
as
reported
in
the
american
newspapers
had
decided
that
she
ought
not
to
have
been
convicted
accordingly
a
petition
setting
forth
the
opinion
of
her
former
neighbors
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
charge
and
should
as
an
american
citizen
be
released
from
custody
was
circulated
for
signature
a
public
meeting
was
held
and
largely
attended
at
which
it
was
resolved
to
send
a
monster
petition
to
the
british
authorities
with
a
request
for
pardon
and
also
to
ask
the
government
at
washington
to
intercede
on
behalf
of
the
unfortunate
sufferer
the
statement
of
the
case
appealed
vividly
to
selma
and
at
the
public
meeting
which
was
attended
chiefly
by
women
she
spoke
and
offered
the
services
of
her
husband
to
lay
the
matter
before
the
president
it
was
further
resolved
to
obtain
the
names
of
influential
persons
all
over
the
country
in
order
that
the
petition
might
show
that
the
sentiment
that
injustice
had
been
done
was
national
as
well
as
local
selma
espoused
the
case
with
ardor
and
busied
herself
in
obtaining
signatures
she
called
on
miss
flagg
and
induced
her
to
sign
by
the
assurance
that
the
verdict
was
entirely
contrary
to
the
evidence
she
then
had
recourse
to
her
former
conceiving
that
the
signature
of
the
president
of
wetmore
college
would
impress
the
english
she
and
pauline
had
already
exchanged
visits
and
pauline
had
shown
no
umbrage
at
her
marriage
the
possibility
of
being
rebuffed
on
this
occasion
did
not
occur
to
selma
she
took
for
granted
that
pauline
would
be
only
too
glad
to
give
her
support
to
so
deserving
a
petition
and
she
considered
that
she
was
paying
her
a
compliment
in
soliciting
her
name
for
insertion
among
the
prominent
signers
pauline
listened
to
her
attentively
then
replied
i
am
sorry
for
the
woman
if
she
is
innocent
and
if
she
has
been
falsely
accused
of
course
she
ought
to
be
released
but
what
makes
you
think
she
is
innocent
selma
the
testimony
did
not
justify
her
conviction
every
one
is
of
that
opinion
have
you
read
the
testimony
yourself
selma
no
pauline
or
your
husband
my
husband
is
satisfied
from
what
others
have
told
him
just
as
i
am
that
this
poor
american
woman
is
languishing
in
prison
as
the
result
of
a
cruel
miscarriage
of
justice
and
that
she
never
committed
the
crime
of
which
she
has
been
found
guilty
my
husband
has
had
considerable
legal
experience
pauline
questions
were
nettling
and
selma
intended
by
her
response
to
suggest
the
presumptuousness
of
her
doubts
in
the
face
of
competent
authority
i
realize
that
your
husband
ought
to
understand
about
such
matters
but
may
one
suppose
that
the
english
authorities
would
deliberately
allow
an
innocent
woman
to
remain
in
prison
they
must
know
that
the
friends
of
hamilton
believe
her
innocent
why
should
we
on
this
side
of
the
water
meddle
simply
because
she
was
born
an
american
why
selma
drew
herself
up
proudly
in
the
first
place
i
believe
we
believe
that
the
english
are
capable
of
keeping
her
in
prison
on
a
technicality
merely
because
she
is
there
already
they
are
worshippers
of
legal
form
and
red
tape
my
husband
says
and
as
to
meddling
why
is
it
not
our
duty
as
an
earnest
and
christian
people
to
remonstrate
against
the
continued
incarceration
of
a
woman
born
under
our
flag
and
accustomed
to
american
ideas
of
justice
meddling
in
my
opinion
we
should
be
cowards
and
derelict
in
our
duty
if
we
did
not
protest
pauline
shook
her
head
i
can
not
see
it
so
it
seems
to
me
an
interference
which
may
make
us
seem
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
as
well
as
offensive
to
them
i
am
sorry
selma
not
to
be
able
to
do
as
you
wish
selma
rose
with
burning
cheeks
but
a
stately
air
if
that
is
your
decision
i
must
do
without
your
name
already
we
have
many
signatures
and
shall
obtain
hundreds
more
without
difficulty
we
look
at
things
differently
pauline
our
point
of
view
has
never
been
the
same
ridiculous
i
should
be
proud
of
the
ridicule
of
people
too
selfish
or
too
unenlightened
to
heed
the
outcry
of
aspiring
humanity
if
we
had
to
depend
on
your
little
set
to
strike
the
note
of
progress
i
fear
we
should
sit
with
folded
hands
most
of
the
time
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
my
little
set
said
pauline
with
a
smile
i
am
too
busy
with
my
college
duties
to
belong
to
any
set
i
see
my
friends
occasionally
just
as
you
see
yours
and
as
to
progress
well
i
fear
that
you
are
right
in
your
statement
that
we
shall
never
look
at
things
alike
to
me
progress
presupposes
in
the
individual
or
the
community
attaining
it
a
prelude
of
slow
struggle
disheartening
doubts
and
modest
reverence
for
previous
results
for
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
the
past
i
mean
by
your
set
the
people
who
think
as
you
do
i
understand
your
point
of
view
i
should
have
liked
she
added
to
ask
you
to
share
with
me
the
responsibility
of
directing
the
policy
of
the
benham
free
hospital
had
i
not
known
that
you
would
listen
to
the
voice
of
conservative
authority
in
preference
to
that
of
fearless
innovation
i
certainly
should
have
hesitated
long
before
i
overruled
the
experience
of
those
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
conscientious
effort
to
discover
truth
that
illustrates
admirably
the
difference
between
us
pauline
no
one
is
more
eager
to
aid
the
discovery
of
truth
than
i
but
i
believe
that
truth
often
is
concealed
from
those
who
go
on
day
after
day
following
routine
however
conscientious
i
recognized
that
ashmun
was
a
live
man
and
had
fresh
ideas
so
i
chose
him
as
our
chief
of
staff
notwithstanding
the
doctors
were
unfriendly
to
him
as
a
result
my
hospital
has
individuality
and
is
already
a
success
that
the
sort
of
thing
i
mean
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
i
expect
to
convert
you
pauline
to
look
at
things
my
way
but
you
must
realize
by
this
time
that
it
is
the
benham
way
yet
the
leading
physicians
of
benham
disapprove
of
your
plans
for
the
management
of
the
hospital
said
pauline
firmly
but
the
people
of
benham
approve
of
them
i
prefer
their
sanction
to
that
of
a
coterie
of
cautious
unenthusiastic
autocrats
selma
true
to
her
intentions
did
not
return
to
washington
with
her
husband
when
congress
reassembled
in
december
while
she
was
absorbed
with
her
philanthropic
plans
in
benham
lyons
was
performing
his
public
duties
seeking
to
do
the
country
good
service
and
at
the
right
moment
to
attract
attention
to
himself
the
opportunity
to
make
a
speech
along
the
line
of
his
public
professions
in
behalf
of
labor
against
corporate
monopoly
did
not
offer
itself
until
late
in
the
session
he
improved
the
few
minutes
allowed
him
to
such
advantage
that
he
was
listened
to
with
close
attention
and
was
at
once
recognized
as
one
of
the
persuasive
and
eloquent
speakers
of
the
minority
before
congress
adjourned
he
obtained
another
chance
to
take
part
in
debate
by
which
he
produced
an
equally
favorable
impression
the
newspapers
of
the
country
referred
approvingly
to
his
cogent
gift
of
statement
and
dignified
style
of
delivery
both
the
bills
against
which
he
spoke
were
passed
by
the
republican
majority
but
echoes
of
his
words
came
back
from
some
of
their
constituents
and
lyons
was
referred
to
as
certain
to
be
one
of
the
strong
men
of
the
house
if
he
returned
to
congress
he
went
home
at
the
close
of
the
session
in
a
contented
frame
of
mind
so
far
as
his
political
prospects
were
concerned
but
he
was
not
free
to
enjoy
the
congratulations
accorded
him
for
the
reason
that
his
business
ventures
were
beginning
to
give
him
serious
solicitude
the
trend
of
the
stock
market
was
again
downward
in
expectation
of
a
rise
from
the
previous
depression
he
had
added
to
the
line
of
shares
which
williams
van
horne
were
carrying
for
him
a
slight
rise
had
come
sufficient
to
afford
him
a
chance
to
escape
from
the
toils
of
wall
street
without
loss
but
he
needed
a
profit
to
rehabilitate
his
ventures
in
other
directions
his
investments
in
the
enterprises
of
his
own
state
which
had
now
for
some
months
appeared
quiescent
if
not
languishing
from
a
speculative
point
of
view
everything
pointed
it
was
said
to
a
further
advance
as
soon
as
congress
adjourned
so
he
had
waited
and
now
although
the
session
was
over
the
stock
market
and
financial
undertakings
of
every
sort
appeared
suddenly
to
be
tottering
he
had
not
been
at
home
a
month
before
prices
of
all
securities
began
to
shrink
inordinately
and
the
business
horizon
to
grow
murky
with
the
clouds
of
impending
disaster
to
add
to
his
worry
lyons
was
conscious
that
he
had
pursued
a
fast
and
loose
mental
coarse
in
regard
to
the
railroad
bill
in
which
his
broker
williams
was
interested
he
had
given
williams
to
understand
that
he
would
try
to
see
his
way
to
support
it
yet
in
view
of
his
late
prominence
in
washington
as
a
foe
of
legislation
in
behalf
of
moneyed
interests
he
was
more
than
ever
averse
to
casting
a
vote
in
its
favor
the
bill
had
not
been
reached
before
adjournment
a
result
to
which
he
had
secretly
contributed
but
it
was
certain
to
be
called
up
shortly
after
congress
reassembled
it
disturbed
him
to
feel
that
his
affairs
in
new
york
were
in
such
shape
that
williams
could
embarrass
him
financially
if
he
chose
it
disturbed
him
still
more
that
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
guilty
of
bad
faith
his
conscience
was
troubled
and
his
favorite
palliative
of
conciliation
did
not
seem
applicable
to
the
case
chapter
viii
until
this
time
the
course
of
financial
events
in
benham
since
its
evolution
from
a
sleepy
country
town
began
had
been
steadily
prosperous
there
had
been
temporary
recessions
in
prices
transient
haltings
in
the
tendency
of
new
local
undertakings
to
double
and
quadruple
in
value
a
few
rash
individuals
indeed
had
been
forced
to
suspend
payments
and
compound
with
their
creditors
but
there
had
been
no
real
set
back
to
commercial
enthusiasm
and
speculative
gusto
those
who
desired
to
borrow
money
for
progressive
enterprises
had
found
the
banks
accommodating
and
unsuspicious
and
to
benham
initiative
it
yet
appeared
that
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
neighborhood
by
the
unwearying
masterful
energy
of
the
citizens
was
still
in
its
infancy
but
now
after
a
few
months
of
inactivity
which
holders
of
speculative
securities
had
spoken
of
as
another
healthy
breathing
spell
the
tendency
of
prices
had
changed
had
not
merely
halted
but
showed
a
radical
tendency
to
shrink
even
to
tumble
feverishly
buyers
were
scarce
and
the
once
accommodating
banks
displayed
a
heartless
disposition
to
scrutinize
collateral
and
to
ask
embarrassing
questions
in
regard
to
commercial
paper
rates
of
interest
on
loans
were
ruthlessly
advanced
and
additional
security
demanded
a
pall
of
dejection
hung
over
benham
evil
days
had
come
days
the
fruit
of
a
long
period
of
inflation
a
dozen
leading
firms
failed
and
carried
down
with
them
diverse
small
people
amid
the
general
distrust
and
anxiety
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
wall
street
the
money
centre
of
the
country
the
gehenna
where
this
cyclone
had
first
manifested
itself
the
newspapers
voicing
benham
public
opinion
cast
vituperation
at
the
bankers
and
brokers
of
wall
street
whose
unholy
jugglings
with
fortune
had
brought
this
commercial
blight
on
the
community
wall
street
had
locked
up
money
consequently
funds
were
tight
in
benham
and
the
plans
of
its
honest
burghers
to
promote
enterprise
and
develop
the
lawful
industries
of
the
country
were
interrupted
so
spoke
public
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
hundreds
of
private
letters
were
being
despatched
through
the
benham
post
office
in
response
to
requests
for
more
margins
on
stocks
held
for
the
honest
burghers
by
the
fraternity
of
wall
street
gamblers
there
was
private
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
also
for
in
the
panic
a
few
of
these
bankers
and
brokers
had
been
submerged
and
the
collateral
of
benham
leading
citizens
had
been
swept
away
the
panic
itself
was
brief
as
panics
always
are
but
it
left
behind
it
everywhere
a
paralyzed
community
so
far
as
benham
was
concerned
only
a
few
actually
failed
but
in
a
host
of
instances
possessors
of
property
who
had
thought
themselves
wealthy
a
year
before
found
that
they
were
face
to
face
with
the
knotty
problem
of
nursing
their
dwarfed
resources
so
as
to
avoid
eventual
insolvency
everything
had
shrunk
fifty
often
one
hundred
per
for
the
basis
of
benham
development
had
been
borrowed
money
many
of
benham
leading
citizens
were
down
to
hard
pan
so
to
speak
their
inchoate
enterprises
were
being
carried
by
the
banks
on
the
smallest
margins
consistent
with
the
solvency
of
those
institutions
and
men
knew
that
months
of
recuperation
must
elapse
before
speculative
properties
would
show
life
again
benham
was
consequently
gloomy
for
once
in
despite
of
its
native
buoyancy
it
would
have
arisen
from
the
ashes
of
a
fire
as
strenuous
as
a
young
lion
but
with
everybody
stocks
and
merchandise
pledged
to
the
money
lenders
enterprise
was
gripped
by
the
throat
in
the
pride
of
its
prosperity
benham
had
dreamed
that
it
was
a
law
unto
itself
and
that
even
wall
street
could
not
affect
its
rosy
commercial
destinies
it
appeared
to
pious
owners
of
securities
almost
as
though
god
had
deserted
his
chosen
city
of
a
chosen
country
lyons
was
among
those
upon
whom
the
harrow
of
this
fall
in
prices
and
subsequent
struggle
with
the
banks
pressed
with
unpleasant
rigor
in
business
phraseology
he
was
too
much
extended
consequently
as
the
margins
of
value
of
the
securities
on
which
he
had
borrowed
dropped
away
he
was
kept
on
as
to
the
future
in
case
the
process
of
shrinkage
went
much
further
he
would
be
required
to
supply
more
collateral
and
if
the
rate
of
money
did
not
fall
the
banks
would
refuse
to
renew
his
notes
as
they
became
due
unless
he
could
furnish
clear
evidence
of
his
solvency
he
was
owing
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
paper
secured
only
by
the
stock
and
bonds
of
enterprises
which
had
no
market
negotiability
from
the
money
which
he
had
borrowed
he
had
sent
from
time
to
time
to
williams
and
van
horne
an
aggregate
of
forty
thousand
dollars
to
protect
some
two
thousand
shares
of
railroad
stocks
williams
had
especially
commended
the
shares
of
the
roads
to
his
attention
and
the
drop
in
prices
had
been
uniformly
severe
in
these
properties
instead
of
being
the
possessor
of
a
stable
quarter
of
a
million
which
he
considered
to
be
the
value
of
his
property
at
the
time
of
his
election
to
congress
lyons
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
serious
financial
collapse
through
which
he
might
lose
everything
before
he
could
discharge
his
liabilities
it
seemed
cruel
to
him
for
he
believed
that
all
his
ventures
were
sound
and
that
if
he
were
not
forced
to
sacrifice
his
possessions
their
future
value
would
attest
his
sagacity
but
at
present
the
securities
of
speculative
enterprises
were
practically
worthless
as
procurers
of
ready
money
the
extreme
circumstances
had
come
upon
him
with
startling
rapidity
so
that
he
found
himself
in
the
unpleasant
predicament
of
having
used
for
temporary
relief
some
of
the
bonds
belonging
to
the
parsons
estate
which
he
held
as
executor
he
had
forwarded
these
to
williams
merely
as
a
matter
of
convenience
before
he
had
become
anxious
expecting
to
be
able
to
replace
them
with
funds
coming
to
him
within
thirty
days
from
a
piece
of
real
estate
for
which
he
had
received
an
offer
he
had
held
off
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
higher
price
the
following
week
when
signs
of
danger
were
multiplying
he
had
found
the
purchaser
unwilling
to
buy
at
any
price
realizing
the
compromising
position
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
by
his
action
he
had
cast
about
feverishly
for
the
means
to
redeem
the
hypothecated
securities
but
all
his
resources
were
taxed
of
a
sudden
by
the
advent
of
the
panic
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
selma
to
allow
substitution
of
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
which
had
been
apportioned
to
her
as
her
legacy
for
the
bonds
but
at
first
he
had
shrunk
from
the
mortification
of
disclosing
his
condition
to
her
and
now
that
the
situation
had
developed
he
feared
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
borrow
this
money
from
her
for
the
protection
of
his
other
interests
it
gave
him
sore
concern
that
he
a
champion
of
moral
ideas
a
leading
church
member
and
a
representative
of
the
federal
government
should
be
put
in
such
an
equivocal
position
here
again
there
was
no
opportunity
for
conciliation
and
dignified
urbanity
was
of
no
avail
if
the
condition
of
drooping
prices
and
general
distrust
a
sort
of
commercial
which
had
succeeded
the
panic
continued
much
longer
he
would
be
driven
to
the
wall
unless
relief
were
forthcoming
nor
was
it
much
consolation
that
many
others
were
on
the
verge
of
failure
financial
insolvency
for
him
would
mean
the
probable
loss
of
his
seat
in
congress
and
the
serious
interruption
of
his
political
career
from
what
source
could
he
hope
for
relief
the
preparations
for
the
autumn
campaign
were
already
being
considered
and
there
was
likelihood
of
another
close
contest
between
the
two
political
parties
but
for
the
worry
occasioned
by
his
plight
he
would
have
resumed
the
contest
with
hopeful
ardor
appreciating
that
the
pecuniary
distress
of
the
community
would
be
likely
to
work
to
his
advantage
his
own
nomination
was
assured
his
appeared
probable
but
after
it
what
could
he
expect
but
the
deluge
one
source
of
the
effectiveness
of
horace
elton
was
that
he
was
wont
to
exercise
foresight
and
make
his
plans
in
advance
while
other
men
were
slumbering
he
had
been
prepared
for
the
panic
because
he
had
been
expecting
it
for
more
than
a
year
and
the
ship
of
his
financial
fortunes
was
close
reefed
to
meet
the
fury
of
the
overdue
gale
also
he
was
quick
to
recognize
that
the
depreciation
of
values
would
inevitably
be
followed
by
a
period
of
business
inactivity
which
would
throw
out
of
employment
a
large
number
of
wage
earners
whose
ballots
as
a
consequence
would
be
cast
against
the
political
party
in
power
as
far
back
as
the
time
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
selma
at
washington
and
selected
her
as
the
wearer
of
his
cameo
pin
he
had
been
incubating
on
a
scheme
for
the
consolidation
of
the
gas
companies
in
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
state
into
one
large
corporation
for
this
corporation
he
required
a
liberal
charter
which
the
next
legislature
would
be
invited
to
grant
he
expected
to
be
able
to
procure
this
franchise
from
the
legislature
but
he
judged
that
the
majority
in
favor
of
the
bill
would
not
be
large
enough
to
pass
it
over
the
governor
veto
accordingly
it
was
of
the
first
importance
that
the
governor
should
be
friendly
to
the
measure
this
was
the
year
of
the
presidential
election
both
political
parties
were
seeking
to
nominate
their
strongest
candidates
for
the
various
federal
and
state
offices
a
promoter
of
large
business
schemes
was
at
a
disadvantage
in
a
campaign
where
party
feelings
ran
high
and
national
issues
were
involved
and
elton
knew
it
he
commonly
chose
an
off
year
in
politics
for
the
consummation
of
his
business
deals
but
he
had
chosen
to
push
his
bill
this
year
for
the
reason
that
he
wished
to
be
in
a
position
to
buy
out
the
cheaply
the
community
was
pressed
for
ready
money
and
many
men
who
would
be
slow
in
prosperous
times
to
extract
gas
shares
from
their
tin
boxes
and
stockings
would
be
glad
to
avail
themselves
of
a
reasonable
cash
offer
elton
was
a
republican
on
national
issues
his
experience
had
been
that
the
republican
party
was
fundamentally
friendly
to
corporations
in
spite
of
occasional
pious
ejaculations
in
party
platforms
to
the
contrary
he
had
a
republican
candidate
for
governor
in
mind
who
would
be
faithful
to
his
interests
but
this
candidate
was
put
aside
in
the
convention
in
deference
to
the
sentiment
that
only
a
man
of
mental
and
moral
calibre
could
command
the
allegiance
of
independent
voters
whose
seemed
essential
to
party
success
the
republican
state
convention
was
held
three
weeks
prior
to
the
date
fixed
for
that
of
their
opponents
within
hours
subsequent
to
the
nomination
of
hon
john
patterson
as
the
republican
candidate
for
governor
while
the
party
organs
were
congratulating
the
public
on
his
selection
and
the
leaders
of
the
party
were
endeavoring
to
suppress
the
murmurs
of
the
disappointed
lower
order
of
politicians
who
in
metaphorical
phrase
felt
that
they
were
sewed
up
in
a
sack
for
another
two
years
by
the
choice
of
this
strong
citizen
one
of
the
most
widely
circulated
democratic
newspapers
announced
in
large
type
on
its
front
page
that
hon
james
lyons
was
the
only
democrat
who
could
defeat
him
in
the
gubernatorial
contest
behind
the
ledger
sheet
of
this
newspaper
which
was
no
other
than
the
benham
lurked
the
keen
intelligence
of
horace
elton
he
knew
that
the
candidate
of
his
own
party
would
never
consent
to
indicate
in
advance
what
his
action
on
the
gas
bill
would
be
and
that
he
would
only
prejudice
his
chances
of
obtaining
favorable
action
when
the
time
arrived
by
any
attempt
to
forestall
a
decision
this
did
not
suit
horace
elton
he
was
accustomed
to
be
able
to
obtain
an
inkling
before
election
that
legislation
in
which
he
was
interested
would
not
encounter
a
veto
his
measures
were
never
dishonest
that
is
he
never
sought
to
foist
bogus
or
fraudulent
undertakings
upon
the
community
he
was
seeking
to
be
sure
eventual
emolument
for
himself
but
he
believed
that
the
franchise
which
he
was
anxious
to
obtain
would
result
in
more
progressive
and
more
effectual
public
service
he
had
never
before
felt
obliged
to
refrain
from
asking
direct
or
indirect
assurance
that
his
plans
would
be
respected
by
the
governor
yet
he
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
just
such
an
occurrence
the
one
chance
in
a
hundred
had
happened
and
he
was
ready
for
it
he
intended
to
contribute
to
the
republican
national
campaign
fund
but
he
did
not
feel
that
the
interests
of
his
state
would
suffer
if
he
used
all
the
influences
at
his
command
to
secure
a
governor
who
would
be
friendly
to
his
scheme
and
congressman
lyons
appeared
to
him
the
most
available
man
for
his
purpose
it
had
already
occurred
to
lyons
that
his
nomination
as
governor
was
a
possibility
for
the
leaders
of
the
party
were
ostensibly
looking
about
for
a
desirable
democrat
with
whom
to
confront
patterson
and
had
shown
an
intention
to
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
the
ambition
of
several
aspirants
for
this
honor
who
might
have
been
encouraged
in
an
ordinary
year
as
probable
victors
he
knew
that
his
name
was
under
consideration
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
accept
the
nomination
if
it
were
offered
to
him
he
would
regret
the
interruption
of
his
congressional
career
but
he
felt
that
his
election
as
governor
in
a
presidential
year
after
a
close
contest
would
make
him
the
leader
of
the
party
in
the
state
and
in
case
the
candidate
of
his
party
were
chosen
president
would
entitle
him
to
important
recognition
from
the
new
administration
moreover
if
he
became
governor
his
financial
status
would
be
strengthened
the
banks
would
be
more
likely
to
accommodate
one
in
such
a
powerful
position
and
he
might
be
able
to
keep
his
head
above
water
until
better
times
brought
about
a
return
of
public
confidence
and
a
recovery
in
prices
yet
he
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
even
as
governor
he
could
escape
betraying
his
financial
embarrassment
and
his
mind
was
so
oppressed
by
the
predicament
in
which
he
found
himself
that
he
made
no
effort
on
his
own
part
to
cause
the
party
leaders
to
fix
their
choice
on
him
nor
did
he
mention
the
possibility
of
his
selection
to
selma
mortification
and
had
made
him
for
the
moment
inert
as
to
his
political
future
and
reluctant
to
confide
his
troubles
to
her
the
clarion
declaration
of
the
benham
in
favor
of
lyons
evoked
sympathetic
echoes
over
the
state
which
promptly
convinced
the
political
chieftains
that
he
was
the
strongest
candidate
to
pit
against
patterson
the
enthusiasm
caused
by
the
suggestion
of
his
name
spread
rapidly
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
his
nomination
at
the
convention
was
regarded
as
certain
the
championship
of
the
was
a
complete
surprise
to
selma
she
had
assumed
that
her
husband
would
return
to
washington
and
that
political
promotion
for
the
present
was
out
of
the
question
when
she
saw
her
husband
features
looking
out
at
her
from
a
large
cut
on
the
front
page
of
the
morning
newspaper
and
read
the
conspicuous
heading
which
accompanied
it
the
nominates
as
governor
the
hon
james
lyons
of
benham
the
most
eloquent
orator
and
most
citizen
of
the
state
her
heart
gave
a
bound
and
she
eagerly
asked
herself
why
not
that
was
just
what
they
needed
what
she
needed
to
secure
her
hold
on
the
social
evolution
of
benham
as
the
wife
of
the
governor
of
the
state
she
would
be
able
to
ignore
the
people
who
held
aloof
from
her
and
introduce
the
reforms
in
social
behavior
on
which
her
heart
was
set
james
have
you
seen
this
she
asked
eagerly
lyons
was
watching
her
from
across
the
breakfast
table
he
had
seen
it
and
had
laid
the
newspaper
within
her
reach
yes
dear
it
is
very
complimentary
is
it
but
what
does
it
mean
are
you
to
be
governor
did
you
know
of
it
james
i
knew
that
my
name
with
others
had
been
mentioned
by
those
who
were
looking
for
a
candidate
whom
we
can
elect
but
this
nomination
of
the
comes
from
a
clear
sky
would
you
like
to
have
me
governor
selma
yes
indeed
if
the
chance
is
offered
you
james
you
will
surely
accept
it
it
would
please
me
immensely
to
see
you
governor
we
should
not
be
separated
then
part
of
the
year
and
and
i
should
be
able
here
in
benham
to
help
you
as
your
wife
ought
to
help
you
i
know
she
added
that
you
have
been
looking
forward
to
the
next
session
of
congress
in
the
hope
of
distinguishing
yourself
but
is
this
a
finer
opportunity
does
it
open
the
door
to
splendid
possibilities
lyons
nodded
his
wife
eager
presentation
of
the
case
confirmed
his
own
conclusions
it
is
an
important
decision
to
make
he
said
with
gravity
if
i
am
not
elected
i
shall
have
lost
my
place
in
the
congressional
line
and
may
find
difficulty
in
recovering
it
later
but
if
the
party
needs
me
if
the
state
needs
me
i
must
not
think
of
that
i
can
not
help
being
gratified
encouraged
by
the
suggestion
that
my
of
my
political
faith
are
turning
to
me
as
their
at
this
time
when
great
public
issues
are
involved
if
i
can
serve
god
and
my
country
in
this
way
and
at
the
same
time
please
you
my
wife
what
can
i
ask
better
he
spoke
with
genuine
feeling
and
reverence
for
it
was
in
keeping
with
his
religious
tendencies
to
recognize
in
advance
the
solemn
responsibilities
of
high
office
and
to
picture
himself
as
the
agent
of
the
heavenly
powers
this
attitude
of
mind
always
found
selma
sympathetic
and
harmonious
her
eyes
kindled
with
enthusiasm
and
she
replied
you
view
the
matter
as
i
would
have
you
view
it
james
if
this
trust
is
committed
to
us
by
providence
it
is
our
duty
to
accept
it
as
lovers
of
our
country
and
promoters
of
true
progress
it
would
seem
so
and
in
some
ways
he
said
as
though
he
felt
the
impulse
to
be
reasonably
frank
toward
providence
in
his
acceptance
of
the
trust
my
election
as
governor
would
be
advantageous
to
my
political
and
business
interests
i
have
not
sought
the
office
he
added
with
dignified
unction
but
my
knowledge
of
local
conditions
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
action
of
the
signifies
that
certain
powerful
influences
are
working
in
my
favor
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
more
accurately
in
regard
to
this
before
long
lyons
happened
to
know
that
the
benham
had
enlarged
its
plant
two
years
previous
and
that
horace
elton
was
still
the
holder
of
its
notes
for
borrowed
money
the
transaction
had
passed
through
his
bank
and
in
the
course
of
his
mental
search
for
reasons
to
account
for
the
sudden
stand
of
the
newspaper
the
thought
came
into
his
mind
and
dwelt
there
that
elton
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
if
so
what
was
elton
reason
why
should
elton
a
republican
desire
his
nomination
surely
not
to
compass
his
defeat
in
this
connection
elton
friendship
and
the
prophecy
made
to
selma
as
to
his
political
future
occurred
to
him
and
forbade
an
invidious
supposition
glamis
thou
art
and
cawdor
and
thou
shalt
be
what
thou
art
promised
lyons
left
selma
with
the
conviction
that
he
would
find
elton
to
be
mainly
responsible
for
what
had
taken
place
shortly
after
reaching
his
office
he
received
a
note
from
him
asking
for
an
appointment
punctually
at
twelve
elton
arrived
and
was
shown
into
lyons
private
room
lyons
gave
orders
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
for
he
believed
that
the
results
of
the
interview
were
likely
to
have
a
serious
bearing
on
his
career
as
a
statesman
both
men
were
of
heavy
physique
but
as
they
sat
facing
each
other
an
observer
would
have
remarked
that
elton
visage
possessed
a
compactness
of
expression
despite
its
rotund
contour
his
closely
trimmed
whiskers
his
small
clear
penetrating
eyes
and
the
effect
of
neatness
conveyed
by
his
personal
appearance
were
so
many
external
indications
of
his
mental
lucidity
and
precision
in
contrast
lyons
face
emphasized
by
its
mobile
mouth
below
which
his
almost
white
chin
beard
hung
pendent
expressed
a
curious
interplay
of
emotional
sanctity
urbane
shrewdness
and
solemn
governor
lyons
at
your
service
said
elton
regarding
him
steadily
do
you
think
so
i
know
so
if
you
desire
it
the
nomination
you
mean
the
election
by
a
comfortable
majority
lyons
breathed
hard
with
satisfaction
if
the
people
of
the
state
choose
to
confide
their
interests
to
my
custody
i
shall
not
refuse
to
serve
them
so
i
supposed
you
may
be
wondering
lyons
why
i
a
republican
should
be
talking
like
this
i
will
tell
you
observation
has
led
me
to
believe
that
the
people
of
this
state
will
elect
a
democratic
governor
this
year
the
hard
times
will
hurt
the
administration
consequently
as
your
friend
and
my
own
friend
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
indicate
to
the
managers
of
your
party
their
strongest
man
i
am
responsible
for
what
you
saw
on
the
front
page
of
the
this
morning
there
need
not
be
much
difficulty
he
added
significantly
in
securing
emphatic
endorsement
throughout
the
state
of
the
preference
lyons
looked
grave
you
must
be
aware
that
our
views
on
public
questions
especially
those
which
concern
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
are
not
the
same
certainly
i
tell
you
frankly
that
while
from
a
humanitarian
point
of
view
i
respect
your
desire
to
relieve
the
inequalities
of
modern
civilization
as
a
business
man
and
a
man
of
some
property
i
do
not
regard
the
remedies
presented
by
your
party
platform
as
just
or
adequate
i
recognize
that
your
opinions
are
hostile
to
corporate
interests
but
i
have
gathered
also
that
you
are
disposed
to
be
reasonable
and
conciliatory
that
you
are
not
inclined
to
regard
all
men
and
all
measures
as
dangerous
merely
because
they
have
means
or
are
introduced
in
the
name
of
capital
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
a
conciliatory
spirit
secures
the
most
definite
results
for
the
public
assented
lyons
precisely
see
here
lyons
elton
said
leaning
forward
across
the
table
at
which
they
were
sitting
i
wish
to
be
entirely
frank
with
you
you
know
me
well
enough
to
understand
that
i
have
not
offered
you
my
support
in
any
philanthropic
spirit
i
could
not
have
deceived
you
as
to
this
had
i
tried
i
am
a
practical
man
and
have
an
axe
to
grind
i
am
urging
your
election
as
governor
because
i
believe
you
to
possess
intelligent
capacity
to
discriminate
between
what
is
harmful
to
the
community
and
what
is
due
to
healthy
individual
enterprise
the
energy
which
is
the
sap
of
american
citizenship
we
capitalists
have
no
fear
of
an
honest
man
provided
he
has
the
desire
and
the
ability
to
protect
legitimate
business
acumen
against
the
slander
of
mere
demagogues
i
have
a
bill
here
he
added
drawing
a
printed
document
from
his
pocket
which
i
am
desirous
to
see
passed
by
the
next
legislature
it
embodies
a
charter
authorizing
the
acquisition
and
merger
in
one
corporation
of
all
the
gas
companies
of
this
state
and
an
extension
of
corporate
powers
so
as
to
cover
all
forms
of
municipal
lighting
were
your
hands
not
tied
by
your
prospective
election
i
should
be
glad
to
offer
you
an
opportunity
to
become
one
of
the
incorporators
for
i
believe
that
the
undertaking
will
be
lucrative
that
of
course
is
out
of
the
question
now
then
this
is
a
perfectly
honest
bill
on
its
face
to
be
sure
it
secures
a
valuable
franchise
for
the
petitioners
and
consequently
may
encounter
some
opposition
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
who
considers
the
matter
candidly
and
closely
can
fail
to
recognize
that
the
great
public
will
secure
cheaper
gas
and
more
efficient
service
as
the
result
of
the
consolidation
and
there
is
where
i
felt
that
i
could
count
on
your
intelligence
you
would
not
allow
the
plea
that
capitalists
were
interested
in
obtaining
a
profitable
franchise
to
obscure
the
more
vital
consideration
that
the
community
will
be
the
true
gainers
lyons
bowed
graciously
and
stroked
his
beard
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
he
asked
to
read
the
bill
in
the
first
place
to
convince
yourself
that
what
i
have
told
you
is
true
to
satisfy
yourself
that
the
measure
is
essentially
harmless
the
bill
is
not
long
read
it
now
and
let
me
hear
your
objections
i
have
some
papers
here
to
look
over
which
will
occupy
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
if
you
can
spare
me
the
time
lyons
acquiesced
and
proceeded
to
peruse
slowly
the
document
when
he
had
finished
it
he
folded
it
solemnly
and
returned
it
to
elton
it
is
a
bill
framed
in
the
interest
of
capital
but
i
can
not
say
that
the
public
will
be
prejudiced
by
it
on
the
contrary
i
should
judge
that
the
price
of
gas
in
our
cities
and
towns
would
be
lowered
as
a
consequence
of
the
reduction
in
running
expenses
caused
by
the
projected
consolidation
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
agree
to
sign
the
bill
as
it
now
stands
if
it
passes
the
legislature
lyons
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
and
his
mouth
moved
tremulously
if
i
am
elected
governor
he
said
i
wish
to
serve
the
people
honestly
and
fearlessly
i
am
sure
of
it
i
ask
you
to
point
out
to
me
in
what
manner
this
bill
trenches
upon
the
rights
of
the
people
you
yourself
have
noted
the
crucial
consequence
it
will
lower
the
price
of
gas
if
at
the
same
time
i
am
benefited
financially
why
should
i
not
reap
the
reasonable
reward
of
my
foresight
i
will
sign
the
bill
elton
if
it
comes
to
me
for
signature
i
may
be
criticised
at
first
but
the
improved
public
service
and
reduction
of
the
gas
bills
will
be
my
justification
and
show
that
i
have
not
been
unmindful
of
the
interests
of
the
great
public
whose
burdens
my
party
is
seeking
to
lighten
i
shall
count
on
you
then
said
elton
after
a
pause
the
failure
of
the
bill
at
the
last
stage
when
i
was
expecting
its
passage
might
affect
my
affairs
seriously
if
the
legislature
does
its
part
i
will
do
mine
responded
lyons
augustly
i
will
sign
the
bill
if
it
comes
to
me
in
the
present
form
i
thank
you
governor
lyons
looked
confused
but
happy
at
the
appellation
by
the
way
said
elton
after
he
had
returned
the
papers
to
his
pocket
these
are
trying
times
for
men
with
financial
obligations
it
is
my
custom
to
be
frank
and
not
to
mince
matters
where
important
interests
are
concerned
a
candidate
for
office
in
this
campaign
will
need
the
use
of
all
his
faculties
if
he
is
to
be
successful
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
the
sake
of
my
bill
to
allow
your
mind
to
be
distracted
by
solicitude
in
regard
to
your
private
affairs
some
of
the
best
and
most
prudent
of
our
business
men
are
pressed
for
ready
money
i
am
in
a
position
to
give
you
temporary
assistance
if
you
require
it
in
justice
to
my
interests
you
must
not
let
delicacy
stand
in
the
way
of
your
accepting
my
offer
lyons
bosom
swelled
with
the
tide
of
returning
happiness
he
had
scarcely
been
able
to
believe
his
ears
yet
here
was
a
definite
spontaneous
proposition
to
remove
the
incubus
which
weighed
upon
his
soul
here
was
an
opportunity
to
redeem
the
bonds
of
the
parsons
estate
and
to
repair
his
damaged
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
the
clouds
of
adversity
which
had
encompassed
him
had
suddenly
been
swept
away
and
that
providence
was
smiling
down
at
him
as
her
approved
and
favorite
son
his
emotion
choked
his
speech
his
lip
trembled
and
his
eyes
looked
as
though
they
would
fill
with
tears
after
a
brief
pause
he
articulated
that
he
was
somewhat
pressed
for
ready
money
some
explanation
of
his
affairs
followed
the
upshot
of
which
was
that
elton
agreed
to
indorse
lyons
promissory
notes
held
by
the
banks
to
the
amount
of
and
to
accept
as
collateral
for
a
personal
loan
of
certain
securities
of
new
local
enterprises
which
had
no
present
marketable
value
by
this
arrangement
his
property
was
amply
protected
from
sacrifice
he
would
be
able
to
adjust
his
speculative
account
in
new
york
and
he
could
await
with
a
tranquil
soul
the
return
of
commercial
confidence
lyons
heart
was
overflowing
with
satisfaction
he
pressed
elton
hand
and
endeavored
to
express
his
gratitude
with
appropriate
grandiloquence
but
elton
disclaimed
the
obligation
asserting
that
he
had
acted
merely
from
to
make
the
election
of
his
candidate
more
certain
the
loan
of
was
completed
within
hours
and
before
the
end
of
another
week
lyons
had
rescued
the
bonds
of
the
parsons
estate
from
pawn
and
disposed
of
his
line
of
stocks
carried
by
williams
van
horne
they
were
sold
at
a
considerable
loss
but
he
made
up
his
mind
to
free
his
soul
for
the
time
being
from
the
toils
and
torment
of
speculation
and
to
nurse
his
dwarfed
resources
behind
the
bulwark
of
elton
relief
fund
until
the
financial
situation
cleared
he
felt
as
though
he
had
grown
ten
years
younger
and
without
confiding
to
selma
the
details
of
these
transactions
he
informed
her
ecstatically
that
owing
to
certain
important
developments
due
partly
to
the
friendliness
of
horace
elton
the
outlook
for
their
future
advancement
had
never
been
so
bright
when
a
month
later
he
was
nominated
as
governor
he
threw
himself
into
the
contest
with
the
convincing
ardor
of
sincere
untrammelled
faith
in
the
reforms
he
was
advocating
his
speeches
reflected
complete
concentration
of
his
powers
on
the
issues
of
the
campaign
and
evoked
enthusiasm
throughout
the
state
by
their
eloquent
arraignment
of
corporate
rapacity
at
the
expense
of
the
sovereign
people
in
several
of
his
most
telling
addresses
he
accused
the
national
administration
of
pandering
to
the
gamblers
who
bought
and
sold
stocks
in
wall
street
chapter
ix
lyons
was
chosen
governor
by
a
large
majority
as
elton
had
predicted
the
republican
party
was
worsted
at
the
polls
and
driven
out
of
power
both
at
washington
and
in
the
state
lyons
ran
ahead
of
his
ticket
receiving
more
votes
than
the
presidential
electors
the
campaign
was
full
of
incidents
grateful
to
selma
self
esteem
chief
among
these
was
the
conspicuous
allusions
accorded
her
by
the
newspapers
the
campaign
itself
was
a
fervid
repetition
of
the
stirring
scenes
of
two
years
previous
once
more
processions
in
vociferous
serried
columns
attested
the
intensity
of
party
spirit
selma
felt
herself
an
adept
through
her
former
experience
and
she
lost
no
opportunity
to
show
herself
in
public
and
bear
witness
to
her
devotion
to
her
cause
it
pleased
her
to
think
that
the
people
recognized
her
when
she
appeared
on
the
balcony
or
reviewing
stand
and
that
her
presence
evoked
an
increase
of
enthusiasm
but
the
newspaper
publicity
was
even
more
satisfying
for
it
centred
attention
unequivocally
on
her
columns
of
descriptive
matter
relative
to
her
husband
personality
began
to
appear
as
soon
as
it
became
obvious
that
he
was
to
be
governor
these
articles
aimed
to
be
exhaustive
in
their
character
covering
the
entire
scope
of
his
past
life
disclosing
pitiless
details
in
regard
to
his
habits
tastes
and
private
concerns
nothing
which
could
be
discovered
or
ferreted
out
was
omitted
and
most
of
these
biographies
were
illuminated
by
a
variety
of
more
or
less
hideous
cuts
showing
for
example
his
excellency
as
he
looked
as
a
school
boy
his
excellency
as
a
fledgling
attorney
the
humble
home
where
his
excellency
was
born
and
his
excellency
present
stately
but
hospitable
residence
on
benham
river
drive
almost
every
newspaper
in
the
state
took
its
turn
at
contributing
something
which
it
conceived
to
be
edifying
to
this
reportorial
budget
and
after
the
governor
came
the
turn
of
the
governor
lady
as
she
was
called
selma
liked
best
the
articles
devoted
exclusively
to
herself
where
she
appeared
as
the
special
feature
of
the
newspaper
issue
not
merely
as
an
adjunct
to
her
husband
but
she
liked
them
all
and
she
was
most
benignant
in
her
reception
of
the
several
newspaper
scribes
principally
of
her
own
sex
who
sought
an
interview
for
the
sake
of
copy
she
withheld
nothing
in
regard
to
her
person
talents
household
or
tastes
which
would
in
her
opinion
be
effective
in
print
she
had
a
photograph
of
herself
taken
in
simple
domestic
matronly
garb
to
supplement
those
which
she
already
possessed
one
of
which
revealed
the
magnificence
of
the
attire
she
wore
at
the
president
reception
another
portrayed
littleton
earnest
bride
and
still
a
fourth
disclosed
her
as
the
wistful
aspiring
on
the
threshold
of
womanhood
these
and
the
facts
appropriate
to
them
she
meted
out
to
her
biographers
from
time
to
time
lubricating
her
amiable
confidences
with
the
assertion
that
both
she
and
her
husband
felt
that
the
people
were
entitled
to
be
made
familiar
with
the
lives
of
their
public
representatives
as
the
result
of
her
gracious
behavior
her
willingness
to
supply
interesting
details
concerning
herself
and
her
flattering
tendency
to
become
intimate
on
the
spot
with
the
reporters
who
visited
her
the
newspaper
articles
in
most
cases
were
in
keeping
with
selma
prepossessions
those
which
pleased
her
most
emphasized
in
the
first
place
her
intellectual
gifts
and
literary
talents
intimating
delicately
that
she
had
refused
brilliant
offers
for
usefulness
with
her
pen
and
on
the
lecture
platform
in
order
to
become
the
wife
of
congressman
lyons
to
whom
her
counsel
and
high
ideals
of
public
service
were
a
constant
stimulus
emphasized
in
the
second
place
her
husband
and
her
own
pious
tastes
and
strong
religious
convictions
to
which
their
constant
church
attendance
and
the
simple
sanctity
of
their
american
home
bore
testimony
emphasized
in
the
third
place
reproducing
ordinarily
a
sketch
and
cut
of
her
her
great
social
gifts
and
graces
which
had
made
her
a
leader
of
society
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
both
in
benham
and
in
new
york
a
few
of
the
articles
stated
in
judicious
terms
that
she
had
been
twice
a
widow
only
one
of
them
set
this
forth
in
conspicuous
and
opprobrious
terms
her
third
husband
our
chief
magistrate
wife
many
marriages
such
was
the
unsympathetic
alliterative
heading
of
the
malicious
statement
which
appeared
in
an
opposition
organ
it
did
no
more
than
recall
the
fact
that
she
had
obtained
a
divorce
from
her
first
husband
who
had
in
his
despair
taken
to
drink
and
intimate
that
her
second
husband
had
not
been
altogether
happy
selma
wept
when
she
read
the
article
she
felt
that
it
was
cruel
and
uncalled
for
that
it
told
only
half
the
truth
and
traduced
her
before
the
american
people
she
chose
to
conceive
that
it
had
been
inspired
by
pauline
and
hallett
taylor
neither
of
whom
had
sent
her
a
word
of
congratulation
on
her
promotion
to
be
the
governor
wife
who
but
pauline
knew
that
her
marriage
with
littleton
had
not
been
completely
harmonious
who
but
taylor
or
one
of
her
set
would
have
the
malice
to
insinuate
that
she
had
been
merciless
to
babcock
this
was
one
libel
in
a
long
series
of
complimentary
productions
the
representation
of
the
family
group
was
made
complete
by
occasional
references
to
the
governor
elect
mother
mother
lyons
the
venerable
parent
of
our
chief
magistrate
altogether
selma
felt
that
the
picture
presented
to
the
public
was
a
truthful
and
inspiring
record
of
pious
and
enterprising
american
life
which
showed
to
the
community
that
its
choice
of
a
governor
had
been
wise
and
was
merited
close
upon
the
election
and
these
eulogistic
biographies
came
the
inauguration
with
lyons
eloquent
address
selma
of
course
had
special
privileges
a
reserved
gallery
in
the
state
house
to
which
she
issued
cards
of
admission
to
friends
of
her
own
selection
occupying
in
festal
attire
the
centre
of
this
conspicuous
group
she
felt
that
she
was
the
cynosure
of
every
eye
she
perceived
that
she
was
constantly
pointed
out
as
the
second
personage
of
the
occasion
to
the
few
legislators
on
the
floor
whom
she
already
knew
she
took
pains
to
bow
from
her
seat
with
gracious
cordiality
intending
from
the
outset
to
aid
her
husband
by
captivating
his
friends
and
conciliating
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
party
on
her
way
to
and
from
the
gallery
she
was
joined
by
several
members
to
each
of
whom
she
tried
to
convey
subtly
the
impression
that
she
purposed
to
take
an
earnest
interest
in
legislative
affairs
and
that
her
husband
would
be
apt
to
consult
her
in
regard
to
close
questions
on
the
morning
after
the
inauguration
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
own
portrait
side
by
side
with
that
of
her
husband
on
the
front
page
of
two
newspapers
a
flattering
indication
as
she
believed
that
the
press
already
recognized
her
value
both
as
a
helpmate
to
him
and
an
ornament
to
the
state
she
took
up
her
life
as
the
governor
lady
feeling
that
her
talents
and
eagerness
to
do
good
had
finally
prevailed
and
that
true
happiness
at
last
was
in
store
for
her
she
was
satisfied
with
her
husband
and
recognized
his
righteous
purpose
and
capacity
as
a
statesman
but
she
believed
secretly
that
his
rapid
success
was
due
in
a
large
measure
to
her
genius
her
prompting
had
inspired
him
to
make
a
notable
speech
in
his
first
congress
her
charms
and
clever
conversation
had
magnetized
elton
so
that
he
had
seen
fit
to
nominate
him
for
governor
a
fresh
impulse
to
her
that
virtue
and
ability
were
reaping
their
reward
was
given
a
few
weeks
later
by
the
announcement
which
lyons
read
from
the
morning
newspaper
that
the
firm
of
williams
van
horne
had
failed
disastrously
the
circumstances
attending
their
were
sensational
it
appeared
that
van
horne
the
office
partner
who
managed
the
finances
had
shot
himself
as
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
fraudulent
hypothecations
of
securities
and
misrepresentations
to
which
it
was
claimed
that
williams
was
not
a
party
the
firm
had
been
hopelessly
insolvent
for
months
and
had
been
forced
to
the
wall
at
last
by
a
futile
effort
on
the
part
of
van
horne
to
redeem
the
situation
by
a
final
speculation
on
a
large
scale
it
had
failed
owing
to
the
continuation
of
the
state
of
dry
rot
in
the
stock
market
and
utter
ruin
followed
the
regret
which
lyons
entertained
as
he
read
aloud
the
tragic
story
was
overshadowed
in
his
mind
by
his
own
thankfulness
that
he
had
redeemed
the
bonds
and
settled
his
account
with
them
before
the
crash
came
he
was
so
absorbed
by
his
own
emotions
that
he
failed
to
note
the
triumphant
tone
of
his
wife
ejaculation
of
amazement
failed
williams
van
horne
failed
oh
how
did
it
happen
i
always
felt
sure
that
they
would
fail
sooner
or
later
selma
sat
with
tightly
folded
hands
listening
to
the
exciting
narrative
which
lyons
read
for
her
edification
with
the
urbanely
mournful
emphasis
of
one
who
has
had
a
narrow
escape
he
stopped
in
the
course
of
it
to
relieve
any
solicitude
which
she
might
be
feeling
in
regard
to
his
dealings
with
the
firm
by
the
assertion
that
he
had
only
two
months
previous
closed
out
his
account
owing
to
the
conviction
that
prudent
investors
were
getting
under
cover
this
assurance
gave
the
episode
a
still
more
providential
aspect
in
selma
eyes
in
the
first
flush
of
her
gratitude
that
flossy
had
been
superbly
rebuked
for
her
frivolous
existence
she
had
forgotten
that
they
were
her
husband
brokers
moreover
the
lack
of
perturbation
in
his
manner
was
not
calculated
to
inspire
alarm
but
the
news
that
lyons
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
escape
at
the
twelfth
hour
without
a
dollar
loss
heightened
the
justice
of
the
situation
she
listened
with
throbbing
pulses
to
the
particulars
she
could
scarcely
credit
her
senses
that
her
irrepressible
and
enemy
had
been
confounded
at
last
confronted
with
bankruptcy
and
probable
disgrace
she
interrupted
the
reading
to
express
her
scepticism
regarding
the
claim
that
williams
had
no
knowledge
of
the
frauds
how
could
he
be
ignorant
he
must
have
known
he
must
have
bribed
the
reporters
to
put
that
in
so
as
to
arouse
the
sympathy
of
some
of
their
fashionable
friends
van
horne
is
dead
and
the
lips
of
the
dead
are
sealed
selma
spoke
with
the
confidence
born
of
bitterness
she
was
pleased
with
her
acumen
in
discerning
the
true
inwardness
of
the
case
her
husband
nodded
with
mournful
acquiescence
it
would
seem
he
said
as
if
he
must
have
had
an
inkling
at
least
of
what
was
going
on
of
course
he
had
gregory
williams
with
all
his
faults
was
a
man
i
always
said
that
lyons
completed
the
reading
and
murmured
with
a
sigh
which
was
half
pity
half
grateful
acknowledgment
of
his
own
good
fortune
it
a
bad
piece
of
business
i
glad
i
had
the
sense
to
act
promptly
selma
was
ruminating
her
steel
bright
eyes
shone
with
exultation
her
sense
of
righteousness
was
gratified
and
temporarily
appeased
have
to
sell
their
house
of
course
and
give
up
their
horses
and
i
do
see
why
it
does
mean
that
flossy
and
her
husband
must
come
down
off
their
pedestal
and
begin
over
again
it
follows
does
it
that
the
heartless
set
into
which
they
have
wormed
their
way
will
drop
them
like
hot
coals
all
these
remarks
were
put
by
selma
in
the
slightly
interrogative
form
as
though
she
were
courting
any
argument
to
the
contrary
which
could
be
adduced
in
order
to
knock
it
in
the
head
but
lyons
saw
no
reason
to
differ
from
her
verdict
it
means
necessarily
great
mortification
for
them
and
a
curtailment
of
their
present
mode
of
life
he
said
i
am
sorry
for
them
sorry
of
course
james
it
is
distressing
to
hear
that
misfortune
has
befallen
any
person
of
one
acquaintance
and
so
far
as
gregory
williams
himself
is
concerned
i
have
no
wish
to
see
him
punished
simply
because
he
has
been
worldly
and
vainglorious
you
thought
him
able
in
a
business
way
and
liked
to
meet
him
but
as
for
her
flossy
his
wife
selma
continued
with
a
gasp
it
would
be
sheer
hypocrisy
for
me
to
assert
that
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
should
deem
myself
unworthy
of
being
considered
an
american
woman
if
i
did
not
maintain
that
this
disgrace
which
has
befallen
them
is
the
logical
and
legitimate
consequence
of
their
godless
lives
especially
of
her
frivolity
and
presumptuous
indifference
to
spiritual
influences
that
woman
james
is
utterly
hostile
to
the
things
of
the
spirit
you
have
no
conception
i
have
never
told
you
because
he
was
your
friend
and
i
was
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
on
the
surface
on
your
account
you
have
no
conception
of
the
cross
her
behavior
became
to
me
in
new
york
from
almost
the
first
moment
we
met
i
saw
that
we
were
far
apart
as
the
poles
in
our
views
of
the
responsibilities
of
life
she
sneered
at
everything
which
you
and
i
reverence
and
she
set
her
face
against
true
progress
and
the
spread
of
american
principles
she
claimed
to
be
my
friend
and
to
sympathize
with
my
zeal
for
social
truth
yet
all
the
time
she
was
toadying
secretly
the
people
whose
luxurious
exclusiveness
made
me
tremble
sometimes
for
the
future
of
our
country
she
and
her
husband
were
prosperous
and
everything
he
touched
seemed
to
turn
to
gold
it
may
sound
irreverent
james
but
there
was
a
time
during
my
life
in
new
york
when
i
was
discouraged
when
it
seemed
as
though
heaven
were
mocking
me
and
my
husband
in
our
homely
struggle
against
the
forces
of
evil
and
bestowing
all
its
favors
on
a
woman
whose
example
was
a
menace
to
american
womanhood
sorry
why
should
i
be
sorry
to
see
justice
triumph
and
shallow
iniquity
rebuked
i
would
give
florence
williams
money
if
she
is
in
want
but
i
am
thankful
very
thankful
that
her
heartless
vanity
has
found
its
proper
reward
lyons
fingered
his
beard
i
did
know
she
was
as
bad
as
that
selma
now
that
they
have
come
to
grief
we
are
not
likely
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
them
and
in
all
probability
they
will
pass
out
of
our
lives
williams
was
smart
and
entertaining
but
i
never
liked
his
taking
advantage
of
the
circumstances
of
my
having
an
account
in
his
office
to
urge
me
to
support
a
measure
at
variance
with
my
political
convictions
precisely
the
trouble
with
them
both
james
is
that
they
have
no
conscience
and
it
is
eminently
just
they
should
be
made
to
realize
that
people
who
lack
conscience
can
not
prosper
in
this
country
in
the
long
run
have
loosed
the
awful
lightnings
of
his
terrible
swift
sword
i
say
to
that
assuredly
selma
lyons
answered
his
predilection
to
palliate
equivocal
circumstances
was
never
proof
against
clear
evidence
of
moral
delinquency
when
his
religious
scruples
were
finally
offended
he
was
grave
and
unrelenting
the
downfall
of
the
williamses
continued
to
be
a
sweet
solace
and
source
of
encouragement
to
selma
it
made
her
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
her
own
recent
progress
feel
that
the
whirligig
of
time
was
working
in
her
behalf
after
all
and
that
if
she
persevered
not
merely
flossy
but
all
those
who
worshipped
mammon
and
consequently
failed
to
recognize
her
talents
would
be
made
to
bite
the
dust
at
the
moment
these
enemies
seemed
to
have
infested
benham
numerically
speaking
they
were
unimportant
but
they
had
established
an
irritating
irregular
skirmish
line
one
end
of
which
occupied
wetmore
college
another
held
secret
midnight
meetings
at
hallett
taylor
rumors
of
various
undertakings
educational
artistic
or
philanthropic
agitated
or
directed
by
this
fringe
of
society
came
to
her
ears
from
time
to
time
but
she
heard
them
as
an
outsider
when
she
became
the
governor
wife
she
had
said
to
herself
that
now
these
aristocrats
would
be
compelled
to
admit
her
to
their
counsels
but
she
found
to
her
annoyance
that
the
election
made
no
difference
neither
pauline
nor
taylor
nor
any
of
the
coterie
had
asked
her
to
join
them
and
she
was
unpleasantly
conscious
that
there
were
people
on
the
river
drive
who
showed
no
more
desire
to
make
her
acquaintance
than
when
she
had
been
lewis
babcock
what
did
this
mean
it
meant
simply
she
began
to
argue
that
she
must
hold
fast
to
her
faith
and
bide
her
time
that
if
she
and
her
friends
kept
a
bold
front
and
resisted
the
encroachments
of
this
pernicious
spirit
providence
would
interfere
presently
and
confound
these
enemies
of
social
truth
no
less
obviously
than
it
had
already
overwhelmed
gregory
williams
as
the
wife
of
the
governor
she
was
clearly
in
a
position
to
maintain
this
bold
front
effectively
every
mail
brought
to
her
requests
for
her
support
and
the
sanction
of
her
signature
to
social
or
charitable
enterprises
her
hospital
was
flourishing
along
the
lines
of
the
policy
which
she
had
indicated
and
was
feeling
the
advantage
of
her
political
prosperity
she
was
able
to
give
the
petition
in
behalf
of
hamilton
which
contained
now
thousand
signatures
fresh
value
and
solemnity
by
means
of
an
autograph
letter
from
the
governor
wife
countersigned
by
the
governor
this
with
the
bulky
list
of
petitioners
she
addressed
and
despatched
directly
to
queen
victoria
her
presence
was
in
constant
demand
at
all
sorts
of
functions
at
many
of
which
she
had
the
opportunity
to
make
a
few
remarks
to
express
the
welcome
of
the
state
or
to
utter
words
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
to
those
assembled
in
the
second
month
of
her
husband
administration
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
greeting
in
her
double
capacity
as
president
of
the
benham
institute
and
wife
of
the
governor
the
federation
of
women
clubs
of
the
united
states
on
the
occasion
of
its
annual
meeting
at
benham
this
federation
was
the
incorporated
fruit
of
the
congress
of
women
clubs
which
selma
had
attended
as
a
delegate
just
previous
to
her
divorce
from
babcock
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
some
exultation
at
the
progress
she
had
made
since
then
as
she
sat
wielding
the
gavel
over
the
body
of
women
delegates
from
every
state
in
the
union
the
meeting
lasted
three
days
literary
exercises
alternated
with
excursions
to
points
of
interest
in
the
neighborhood
at
all
of
which
she
was
in
authority
and
the
celebration
was
brought
to
a
brilliant
close
by
a
banquet
to
which
men
were
invited
at
this
selma
acted
as
toastmaster
introducing
the
speakers
of
the
occasion
which
included
her
own
husband
lyons
made
a
graceful
allusion
to
her
stimulating
influence
as
a
helpmate
and
her
executive
capacity
which
elicited
loud
applause
succeeding
this
meeting
of
the
federation
of
women
clubs
came
a
series
of
festivities
under
the
patronage
of
women
philanthropic
literary
or
social
in
character
for
the
fever
to
perpetuate
in
club
form
every
congregation
of
citizens
except
on
election
day
had
seized
benham
in
common
with
the
other
cities
of
the
country
in
its
grasp
to
each
of
which
the
governor
wife
was
invited
as
the
principal
guest
of
honor
selma
thus
found
a
dozen
opportunities
to
exhibit
herself
to
a
large
audience
and
testify
to
her
faith
in
democratic
institutions
on
the
of
february
washington
birthday
she
held
a
reception
at
their
house
on
river
drive
for
which
cards
had
been
issued
a
fortnight
previous
she
pathetically
explained
to
the
reporters
that
had
the
dimensions
and
resources
of
her
establishment
permitted
she
and
the
governor
would
simply
have
announced
themselves
at
home
to
the
community
at
large
that
they
would
have
preferred
this
but
of
course
it
would
never
do
the
people
would
not
be
pleased
to
see
a
rabble
confound
the
hospitality
of
the
chief
magistrate
and
his
wife
the
people
demanded
proper
dignity
from
their
representatives
in
office
the
list
of
invitations
which
selma
sent
out
was
however
comprehensive
she
aimed
to
invite
everyone
of
social
public
commercial
or
political
importance
a
full
band
was
in
attendance
and
a
liberal
collation
was
served
selma
confided
to
some
of
her
guests
who
she
thought
might
criticise
the
absence
of
wine
that
she
had
felt
obliged
out
of
consideration
for
her
husband
political
prospects
to
avoid
wounding
the
feelings
of
total
abstainers
the
entertainment
lasted
from
four
to
seven
and
the
three
hours
of
provided
a
delicious
experience
to
the
hostess
she
gloried
in
the
consciousness
that
this
crush
of
citizens
representing
the
leaders
of
the
community
in
the
widest
sense
had
been
assembled
by
her
social
gift
and
that
they
had
come
to
offer
their
admiring
homage
to
the
clever
wife
of
their
governor
it
gratified
her
to
think
that
pauline
and
taylor
and
the
people
of
that
class
to
all
of
whom
she
had
sent
cards
should
behold
her
as
the
first
lady
of
the
state
and
mistress
of
a
beautiful
home
dispensing
hospitality
on
broad
democratic
lines
to
an
admiring
constituency
when
horace
elton
approached
selma
perpetrated
a
little
device
which
she
had
planned
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
shaking
hands
a
very
handsome
rose
fell
seemingly
by
chance
from
the
bouquet
which
she
carried
he
picked
it
up
and
tendered
it
to
her
but
selma
made
him
keep
it
adding
in
a
lower
tone
it
is
your
due
for
the
gallant
friendship
you
have
shown
me
and
my
husband
she
felt
as
though
she
were
a
queen
bestowing
a
guerdon
on
a
favorite
minister
and
yet
a
woman
rewarding
in
a
woman
way
an
admirer
devotion
she
meant
elton
to
appreciate
that
she
understood
that
his
interest
in
lyons
was
largely
due
to
his
partiality
for
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
recognize
to
this
extent
his
chivalrous
conduct
without
smirching
her
blameless
record
as
an
american
housewife
meantime
the
governor
was
performing
his
public
duties
with
becoming
dignity
and
without
much
mental
friction
the
legislature
was
engaged
in
digesting
the
batch
of
miscellaneous
business
presented
for
its
consideration
among
which
was
elton
gas
consolidation
bill
already
the
measure
had
encountered
some
opposition
in
committee
but
lyons
was
led
to
believe
that
the
bill
would
be
passed
by
a
large
majority
and
that
its
opponents
would
be
conciliated
before
his
signature
was
required
lyons
reputation
as
an
orator
had
been
extended
by
his
term
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
his
recent
active
campaign
and
he
was
in
receipt
of
a
number
of
invitations
from
various
parts
of
the
country
to
address
august
bodies
in
other
states
all
of
these
were
declined
but
when
in
the
month
of
april
opportunity
was
afforded
him
to
deliver
a
speech
on
patriotic
issues
on
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
lexington
he
decided
with
selma
approval
to
accept
the
invitation
he
reasoned
that
a
short
respite
from
the
cares
of
office
would
be
agreeable
she
was
attracted
by
the
glamour
of
revisiting
new
york
as
a
woman
of
note
new
york
had
refused
to
recognize
her
superiority
and
to
do
her
homage
and
new
york
should
realize
her
present
status
and
what
a
mistake
had
been
made
the
speech
was
a
success
and
the
programme
provided
for
the
entertainment
of
the
orator
and
his
wife
included
the
hospitality
of
several
private
houses
selma
felt
that
she
could
afford
to
hold
her
head
high
and
not
to
thaw
too
readily
for
the
benefit
of
a
society
which
had
failed
to
appreciate
her
worth
when
it
had
the
chance
she
was
the
wife
now
of
one
of
the
leading
public
men
of
the
nation
and
in
a
position
to
set
fashions
not
to
ask
favors
nevertheless
she
chose
on
the
evening
before
their
return
to
benham
to
show
herself
at
dinner
at
delmonico
just
to
let
the
world
of
fashion
perceive
her
and
ask
who
she
was
there
would
doubtless
be
people
there
who
knew
her
by
sight
and
who
when
they
were
told
that
she
was
now
the
wife
of
governor
lyons
would
regret
if
not
be
ashamed
of
their
and
snobbery
she
wore
a
striking
dress
she
encouraged
her
husband
willingness
to
order
an
elaborate
dinner
including
champagne
for
they
were
in
a
champagne
country
and
she
exhibited
a
sprightly
mood
looking
about
her
with
a
knowing
air
in
observation
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
while
she
was
thus
engaged
the
entrance
of
a
party
of
six
whom
the
head
waiter
conducted
with
a
show
of
attention
to
a
table
which
had
evidently
been
reserved
for
them
fettered
selma
attention
she
stared
unable
to
believe
her
eyes
then
flushed
and
looked
indignant
her
attention
remained
rivetted
on
this
party
while
they
laid
aside
their
wraps
and
seated
themselves
struck
by
the
annoyed
intensity
of
his
expression
lyons
turned
to
follow
the
direction
of
her
gaze
what
is
the
matter
he
said
for
a
few
moments
selma
sat
silent
with
compressed
lips
intent
on
her
scrutiny
it
an
outrage
on
decency
she
murmured
at
last
how
dare
she
show
herself
here
and
entertain
those
people
of
whom
are
you
talking
selma
the
williamses
flossy
williams
and
her
husband
the
two
couples
with
them
live
on
fifth
avenue
and
used
to
be
among
her
exclusive
friends
her
husband
has
just
ordered
the
dinner
i
saw
him
give
the
directions
to
the
waiter
it
is
monstrous
that
they
who
only
a
few
months
ago
failed
disgracefully
and
were
supposed
to
have
lost
everything
should
be
going
on
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
people
in
new
york
have
the
faculty
of
getting
on
their
feet
again
quickly
after
financial
reverses
said
lyons
mildly
like
as
not
some
of
williams
friends
have
enabled
him
to
make
a
fresh
start
so
it
seems
selma
answered
sternly
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
with
a
discouraged
air
and
neglected
her
truffled
chicken
it
is
right
it
is
decent
lyons
was
puzzled
by
her
demeanor
why
should
you
care
what
they
do
he
asked
we
can
easily
avoid
them
for
the
future
because
because
james
lyons
i
ca
bear
to
see
godless
people
triumph
because
it
offends
me
to
see
a
man
and
woman
who
are
practically
penniless
through
their
own
evil
courses
and
should
be
discredited
everywhere
able
to
resume
their
life
of
vanity
and
extravagance
without
protest
while
she
was
speaking
selma
suddenly
became
aware
that
her
eyes
had
met
those
of
george
page
who
was
passing
their
table
on
his
way
out
recognition
on
both
sides
came
at
the
same
moment
and
selma
turned
in
her
chair
to
greet
him
cutting
off
any
hope
which
he
may
have
had
of
passing
unobserved
she
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
show
the
company
that
she
was
on
familiar
terms
with
a
man
so
well
known
and
she
had
on
her
tongue
what
she
regarded
as
a
piece
of
banter
quite
in
keeping
with
his
usual
vein
how
do
dr
page
we
have
met
for
a
long
time
you
do
not
know
my
husband
governor
lyons
i
think
dr
page
used
to
be
our
family
physician
when
i
lived
in
new
york
james
everyone
here
knows
that
he
has
a
very
large
practice
selma
was
disposed
to
be
gracious
and
sprightly
for
she
felt
that
dr
page
must
surely
be
impressed
by
her
appearance
of
prosperity
i
had
heard
of
your
marriage
and
of
your
husband
election
i
congratulate
you
you
are
living
in
benham
i
believe
far
from
this
yes
a
little
bird
told
me
the
other
day
that
a
no
less
distinguished
person
than
dr
page
had
been
seen
in
benham
twice
during
the
last
three
months
of
course
a
governor
wife
is
supposed
to
know
everything
which
goes
on
and
for
certain
reasons
i
was
very
much
interested
to
hear
this
bit
of
news
i
am
a
very
discreet
woman
doctor
it
shall
go
no
further
the
physician
broad
brow
contracted
slightly
but
his
habitual
concealed
completely
the
inclination
to
strangle
his
inquisitor
he
was
the
last
man
to
shirk
the
vicissitudes
of
playful
speech
and
he
preferred
this
mood
of
selma
to
her
solemn
style
although
his
privacy
was
invaded
i
should
have
remembered
he
said
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
which
lyons
does
not
know
by
intuition
including
the
management
of
a
hospital
dr
page
perhaps
you
know
that
i
am
the
managing
trustee
of
a
large
hospital
yes
i
was
informed
of
that
in
benham
i
should
scarcely
venture
to
tell
you
what
my
little
bird
said
it
was
an
old
fogy
of
a
bird
with
a
partiality
for
thorough
investigation
and
scientific
methods
and
a
thorough
distrust
of
the
results
of
inspiration
in
the
treatment
of
disease
i
dare
say
but
we
are
succeeding
splendidly
the
next
time
you
come
to
benham
you
must
come
to
see
me
and
i
will
take
you
over
our
hospital
i
do
despair
yet
of
converting
you
to
our
side
just
as
you
evidently
do
despair
of
inducing
a
certain
lady
some
day
to
change
her
mind
i
for
one
think
that
she
is
more
fitted
by
nature
to
be
a
wife
than
a
college
president
so
i
shall
await
with
interest
more
news
from
my
little
bird
selma
felt
that
she
was
talking
to
greater
advantage
than
almost
ever
before
her
last
remark
banished
every
trace
of
a
smile
from
her
adversary
face
and
he
stood
regarding
her
with
a
preternatural
gravity
which
should
have
been
appalling
but
which
she
welcomed
as
a
sign
of
serious
feeling
on
his
part
she
felt
too
that
at
last
she
had
got
the
better
of
the
ironical
doctor
in
repartee
and
that
he
was
taking
his
leave
in
truth
he
was
so
angry
that
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
he
simply
glared
and
departed
poor
fellow
she
said
by
way
of
explanation
to
lyons
i
suppose
his
emotion
got
the
better
of
him
because
he
has
loved
her
so
long
that
was
the
dr
page
who
has
been
crazy
for
years
to
marry
pauline
littleton
when
he
was
young
he
married
a
woman
of
doubtful
character
who
ran
away
from
him
i
used
to
think
that
pauline
was
right
in
refusing
to
sacrifice
her
life
for
his
sake
but
he
has
been
very
constant
and
i
doubt
if
she
has
originality
enough
to
keep
her
position
as
president
of
wetmore
long
he
belongs
to
the
old
school
of
medicine
it
was
he
who
took
care
of
wilbur
when
he
died
i
fancy
that
case
may
have
taught
him
not
to
mistrust
truth
merely
because
it
is
labelled
but
i
bear
him
no
malice
because
i
know
he
meant
to
do
his
best
they
are
just
suited
for
each
other
and
i
shall
be
on
his
side
after
this
the
interest
of
this
episode
served
to
restore
somewhat
serenity
but
she
kept
her
attention
fixed
on
the
table
where
the
williamses
were
sitting
observing
with
a
sense
of
injury
their
gay
behavior
to
all
appearances
flossy
was
as
and
volatile
as
ever
her
attire
was
in
the
height
of
fashion
had
adversity
taught
her
nothing
had
the
buffet
of
providence
failed
utterly
to
sober
her
frivolous
spirit
it
seemed
to
selma
that
there
could
be
no
other
conclusion
and
though
she
and
lyons
had
finished
dinner
she
was
unable
to
take
her
eyes
off
the
culprits
or
to
cease
to
wonder
how
it
was
possible
for
people
with
nothing
to
continue
to
live
as
though
they
had
everything
her
moral
nature
was
stirred
to
resentment
and
she
sat
seeking
in
vain
for
a
point
of
consolation
meantime
lyons
like
a
good
american
had
sent
for
an
evening
paper
and
was
deep
in
its
perusal
a
startled
ejaculation
from
him
aroused
selma
from
her
nightmare
her
husband
was
saying
to
her
across
the
table
my
dear
senator
calkins
is
dead
he
spoke
in
a
solemn
excited
whisper
our
senator
calkins
yes
this
is
the
despatch
from
washington
states
senator
calkins
dropped
dead
suddenly
in
the
lobby
of
the
senate
chamber
at
ten
this
morning
while
talking
with
friends
his
age
was
the
cause
of
his
death
was
his
decease
has
cast
a
gloom
over
the
capital
and
the
senate
adjourned
promptly
out
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
statesman
what
a
dreadful
thing
selma
murmured
the
ways
of
providence
are
inscrutable
said
lyons
no
one
could
have
foreseen
this
public
calamity
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
and
drank
it
feverishly
it
fortunate
we
have
everything
arranged
to
return
for
of
course
you
will
be
needed
at
home
yes
waiter
bring
me
a
telegram
what
are
you
going
to
do
communicate
to
calkins
our
sympathy
on
account
of
the
death
of
her
distinguished
husband
that
will
be
nice
said
selma
she
sat
for
some
moments
in
silence
observing
her
husband
and
by
the
splendid
possibility
which
presented
itself
she
knew
that
lyons
gravity
and
agitation
were
not
wholly
due
to
the
shock
of
the
catastrophe
he
like
herself
must
be
conscious
that
he
might
become
the
dead
senator
successor
he
poured
out
and
drained
another
goblet
of
twice
he
drew
himself
up
slightly
and
looked
around
the
room
with
the
expression
habitual
to
him
when
about
to
deliver
a
public
address
selma
veins
were
tingling
with
excitement
providence
had
interfered
in
her
behalf
again
as
the
wife
of
a
united
states
senator
everything
would
be
within
her
grasp
james
she
said
we
are
the
last
persons
in
the
world
to
fail
in
respect
to
the
illustrious
dead
but
of
course
you
ought
to
have
senator
calkins
place
lyons
looked
at
his
wife
and
his
large
lips
trembled
if
the
people
of
my
state
selma
feel
that
i
am
the
most
suitable
man
for
the
vacant
senatorship
i
shall
be
proud
to
serve
them
selma
nodded
appreciatively
she
was
glad
that
her
husband
should
approach
the
situation
with
a
solemn
sense
of
responsibility
they
are
sure
to
feel
that
she
said
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
practically
certain
of
the
party
nomination
and
your
party
has
a
clear
majority
of
both
branches
of
the
legislature
lyons
glanced
furtively
about
him
before
he
spoke
i
do
see
at
the
moment
selma
how
they
can
defeat
me
chapter
x
the
body
of
senator
calkins
was
laid
to
rest
with
appropriate
ceremonies
in
the
soil
of
his
native
state
and
his
virtues
as
a
statesman
and
citizen
were
celebrated
in
the
pulpit
and
in
the
public
prints
on
the
day
following
the
funeral
the
contest
for
his
place
began
in
dead
earnest
there
had
been
some
quiet
canvassing
by
the
several
candidates
while
the
remains
were
being
transported
from
washington
but
public
utterance
was
stayed
until
the
last
rites
were
over
then
it
transpired
that
there
were
four
candidates
in
the
field
a
congressman
an
a
orator
named
stringer
who
was
a
member
of
the
upper
branch
of
the
state
legislature
and
who
claimed
to
be
a
true
defender
of
popular
rights
and
hon
james
lyons
newspaper
comment
concerning
the
candidacy
of
these
aspirants
early
promulgated
the
doctrine
that
governor
lyons
was
entitled
to
the
place
if
he
desired
it
more
than
one
party
organ
claimed
that
his
brilliant
services
had
given
him
a
reputation
beyond
the
limit
of
mere
political
prestige
and
that
he
had
become
a
veritable
favorite
son
of
the
state
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
had
withdrawn
in
favor
of
lyons
while
the
following
of
the
congressman
was
recognized
to
be
inconsiderable
and
that
he
was
holding
out
in
order
to
obtain
terms
only
the
orator
stringer
remained
on
him
the
opposition
within
the
party
had
decided
to
unite
their
forces
to
all
appearances
they
were
in
a
decided
minority
there
was
no
hope
that
the
republican
members
of
the
legislature
would
join
them
for
it
seemed
scarcely
good
politics
to
rally
to
the
support
of
a
citizen
whose
statesmanship
had
not
been
tested
in
preference
to
the
governor
of
the
state
it
was
conceded
by
all
but
the
immediate
followers
of
stringer
that
lyons
would
receive
the
majority
vote
of
either
house
and
be
triumphantly
elected
on
the
first
joint
ballot
and
yet
the
opposition
to
the
governor
though
numerically
small
was
genuine
stringer
was
as
he
described
himself
a
man
of
the
plain
people
that
is
he
was
a
lawyer
with
a
denunciating
voice
a
keen
mind
and
a
comprehensive
grasp
on
language
who
was
still
an
attorney
for
plaintiffs
and
whose
ability
had
not
yet
been
recognized
by
corporations
or
conservative
souls
he
was
where
lyons
had
been
ten
years
before
but
he
had
neither
the
urbanity
conciliatory
tendencies
nor
dignified
solid
physical
properties
of
the
governor
he
was
pleased
to
refer
to
himself
as
a
tribune
of
the
people
and
his
thin
nervous
figure
clad
in
a
long
with
a
yawning
collar
and
black
whisp
tie
his
fiery
utterance
and
relentless
zeal
bore
out
the
character
he
looked
hungry
and
his
words
suggested
that
he
was
in
earnest
carrying
conviction
to
some
of
his
colleagues
in
the
legislature
the
election
at
which
lyons
had
been
chosen
chief
magistrate
had
brought
into
this
state
government
a
sprinkling
of
socialistic
spirits
as
they
were
called
who
applauded
vigorously
the
thinly
veiled
allusions
which
stringer
made
in
debate
to
the
lukewarm
democracy
of
some
of
the
party
leaders
when
he
spoke
with
stern
contempt
of
those
who
played
fast
and
loose
with
sacred
principles
who
were
staunch
friends
of
the
humblest
citizens
on
the
public
platform
and
behind
their
backs
grew
slyly
rich
on
the
revenues
of
wealthy
corporations
everyone
knew
that
he
was
baiting
the
governor
these
diatribes
were
stigmatized
as
in
wretched
taste
but
the
politicians
of
both
parties
could
not
help
being
amused
they
admitted
behind
their
hands
that
the
taunt
was
not
altogether
groundless
and
that
lyons
certainly
was
on
extremely
pleasant
terms
with
prosperity
for
an
out
and
out
champion
of
popular
rights
nevertheless
the
leading
party
newspapers
termed
stringer
a
demagogue
and
accused
him
of
endeavoring
to
foment
discord
in
the
ranks
of
the
democracy
by
questioning
the
loyalty
of
a
man
who
had
led
them
to
notable
victory
twice
in
the
last
three
years
he
was
invited
to
step
down
and
to
season
his
aspirations
until
he
could
present
a
more
significant
public
record
what
had
he
done
that
entitled
him
to
the
senatorship
he
had
gifts
undeniably
but
he
was
young
and
could
wait
this
was
a
taking
argument
with
the
legislators
many
of
whom
had
grown
gray
in
the
party
service
and
lyons
managers
felt
confident
that
the
support
accorded
to
this
tribune
of
the
people
would
dwindle
to
very
small
proportions
when
the
time
came
to
count
noses
suddenly
there
loomed
into
sight
on
the
political
horizon
and
came
bearing
down
on
lyons
under
full
sail
elton
bill
for
the
consolidation
of
the
gas
companies
the
benham
had
not
been
one
of
the
promoters
of
lyons
senatorial
canvass
but
it
had
not
espoused
the
cause
of
any
of
his
competitors
and
latterly
had
referred
in
acquiescent
terms
to
his
election
as
a
foregone
conclusion
he
had
not
happened
to
run
across
elton
during
these
intervening
weeks
and
preferred
not
to
encounter
him
he
cherished
an
hope
that
elton
was
in
no
haste
regarding
the
bill
and
that
consequently
it
might
not
pass
the
legislature
until
after
his
election
as
senator
if
he
were
to
come
in
contact
with
elton
the
meeting
might
jog
the
busy
memory
it
was
a
barren
hope
immediately
after
the
announced
that
governor
lyons
was
practically
sure
to
be
the
next
united
states
senator
the
gas
bill
was
reported
favorably
by
the
committee
which
had
it
in
charge
and
was
advanced
rapidly
in
the
house
debate
on
its
provisions
developed
that
it
was
not
to
have
entirely
plain
sailing
though
the
majority
recorded
in
its
favor
on
the
first
and
second
readings
was
large
it
was
not
at
first
regarded
as
a
party
measure
its
supporters
included
most
of
the
republicans
and
more
than
half
of
the
democrats
yet
the
opposition
to
it
proceeded
from
the
wing
of
the
democracy
with
which
stringer
was
affiliated
elton
interest
in
the
bill
was
well
understood
and
the
work
of
pledging
members
in
advance
irrespective
of
party
had
been
so
thoroughly
done
that
but
for
the
exigencies
of
the
senatorial
contest
it
would
probably
have
slipped
through
without
notice
as
a
harmless
measure
as
it
was
the
opposition
to
it
in
the
lower
branch
was
brief
and
seemed
unimportant
the
bill
passed
the
house
of
representatives
by
a
nearly
vote
and
went
promptly
to
the
senate
calendar
then
suddenly
it
became
obvious
to
lyons
not
merely
that
elton
was
bent
on
securing
its
passage
while
the
present
governor
was
in
office
but
that
his
rival
stringer
had
conceived
the
cruel
scheme
of
putting
him
in
the
position
by
a
hue
and
cry
against
monopoly
and
corporate
interests
where
his
election
to
the
senatorship
would
be
imperilled
if
he
did
not
veto
the
measure
by
a
caustic
speech
in
the
senate
stringer
drew
public
attention
to
the
skilfully
concealed
iniquities
of
the
proposed
franchise
and
public
attention
thus
aroused
began
to
bristle
newspapers
here
and
there
throughout
the
state
put
forth
edicts
that
this
legislature
had
been
chosen
to
protect
popular
principles
and
that
here
was
an
opportunity
for
the
democratic
party
to
fulfil
its
pledges
and
serve
the
people
stringer
and
his
associates
were
uttering
in
the
senate
burning
words
against
the
audacious
menace
of
what
they
termed
the
franchise
octopus
did
the
people
realize
that
this
bill
to
combine
gas
companies
which
looked
so
innocent
on
its
face
was
a
gigantic
scheme
to
wheedle
them
out
of
a
valuable
franchise
for
nothing
did
they
understand
that
they
were
deliberately
putting
their
necks
in
the
grip
of
a
monster
whose
tentacles
would
squeeze
and
suck
their
for
its
own
enrichment
stringer
hammered
away
with
fierce
and
reiterated
invective
he
had
no
hope
of
defeating
the
bill
but
he
confidently
believed
that
he
was
putting
his
adversary
the
governor
in
a
hole
it
had
been
noised
about
the
lobbies
by
the
friends
of
the
measure
earlier
in
the
session
that
the
governor
was
all
right
and
could
be
counted
on
stringer
reasoned
that
lyons
was
committed
to
the
bill
that
if
he
signed
it
his
opponents
might
prevent
his
election
as
senator
on
the
plea
that
he
had
catered
to
corporate
interests
that
if
he
vetoed
it
he
would
lose
the
support
of
powerful
friends
who
might
seek
to
revenge
themselves
by
uniting
on
his
opponent
stringer
recognized
that
he
was
playing
a
desperate
game
but
it
was
his
only
chance
one
thing
was
evident
already
as
a
result
of
the
exposure
in
the
senate
considerable
public
hostility
to
the
bill
was
manifesting
itself
petitions
for
its
defeat
were
in
circulation
and
several
senators
who
had
been
supposed
to
be
friendly
to
its
passage
veered
round
in
deference
to
the
views
of
their
constituents
its
defeat
had
almost
become
a
party
measure
a
majority
of
the
democrats
in
the
senate
were
claimed
to
be
against
it
nevertheless
there
was
no
delay
on
the
part
of
those
in
charge
in
pushing
it
to
final
action
they
had
counted
noses
and
their
margin
of
support
had
been
so
liberal
they
could
afford
to
lose
a
few
deserters
after
a
fierce
debate
the
bill
was
passed
to
be
engrossed
by
a
majority
of
eleven
the
democrats
in
the
senate
were
just
evenly
divided
on
the
ballot
what
would
the
governor
do
this
was
the
question
on
everyone
lips
would
he
sign
or
veto
the
bill
public
opinion
as
represented
by
the
newspapers
was
prompt
to
point
out
his
duty
the
verdict
of
a
leading
party
organ
was
that
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
governor
lyons
could
scarcely
do
otherwise
than
refuse
to
give
his
official
sanction
to
a
measure
which
threatened
to
increase
the
burdens
of
the
plain
people
the
words
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
appeared
to
be
an
euphemism
for
in
view
of
his
ambition
to
become
united
states
senator
several
journals
declared
unequivocally
that
it
would
become
the
duty
of
the
party
to
withdraw
its
support
from
governor
lyons
in
case
he
allowed
this
undemocratic
measure
to
become
law
on
the
other
hand
certain
party
organs
questioned
the
justice
of
the
outcry
against
the
bill
arguing
that
the
merits
of
the
case
had
been
carefully
examined
in
the
legislature
and
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
governor
to
disturb
the
result
of
its
action
on
the
day
after
the
bill
was
sent
to
the
chief
magistrate
an
editorial
appeared
in
the
benham
presenting
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
its
provisions
and
pointing
out
that
though
the
petitioners
might
under
certain
contingencies
reap
a
reasonable
profit
the
public
could
not
fail
in
that
event
to
secure
a
lower
price
for
gas
and
more
effective
service
this
article
was
quoted
extensively
throughout
the
state
and
was
ridiculed
or
extolled
according
to
the
sympathies
of
the
critics
lyons
received
a
marked
copy
of
the
on
the
morning
when
it
appeared
he
recognized
the
argument
as
that
which
he
had
accepted
at
the
time
he
promised
to
sign
the
bill
if
he
were
elected
governor
in
the
course
of
the
same
day
a
letter
sent
by
messenger
was
handed
to
him
in
the
executive
chamber
it
contained
simply
two
lines
in
pencil
in
elton
handwriting
it
continues
to
be
of
vital
importance
to
my
affairs
that
the
pending
bill
should
receive
your
signature
that
was
obviously
a
polite
reminder
of
their
agreement
an
intimation
that
the
circumstances
had
not
altered
and
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
perform
his
part
of
their
compact
obviously
too
horace
elton
took
for
granted
that
a
reminder
was
enough
and
that
he
would
keep
his
word
he
had
promised
to
sign
the
bill
he
had
given
his
word
of
honor
to
do
so
and
elton
was
relying
on
his
good
faith
the
situation
had
become
suddenly
oppressive
and
disheartening
just
when
his
prospects
seemed
assured
this
unfortunate
obstacle
had
appeared
in
his
path
and
threatened
to
confound
his
political
career
he
must
sign
the
bill
and
if
he
signed
it
in
all
probability
he
would
lose
the
senatorship
his
enemies
would
claim
that
the
party
could
not
afford
to
stultify
itself
by
the
choice
of
a
candidate
who
favored
monopolies
he
had
given
his
promise
the
word
of
a
man
of
honor
and
a
business
man
what
escape
was
there
from
the
predicament
if
he
vetoed
the
bill
would
he
not
be
a
liar
and
a
poltroon
if
he
signed
it
the
senatorship
would
slip
through
his
fingers
the
thought
occurred
to
him
to
send
for
elton
and
throw
himself
on
his
mercy
but
he
shrank
from
such
an
interview
elton
was
a
business
man
and
a
promise
was
a
promise
he
had
enjoyed
the
consideration
for
his
promise
his
notes
were
secure
and
the
hypothecated
bonds
had
been
redeemed
he
was
on
his
feet
and
governor
thanks
to
elton
interposition
and
now
he
was
called
on
to
do
his
part
to
pay
the
fiddler
he
must
sign
the
bill
lyons
had
five
days
in
which
to
consider
the
matter
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
he
neither
signed
nor
vetoed
the
bill
it
would
become
law
without
his
signature
he
was
at
bay
and
the
time
for
deliberation
was
short
an
incubus
of
disappointment
weighed
upon
his
soul
and
clouded
his
brow
his
round
smooth
face
looked
grieved
it
seemed
cruel
to
him
that
such
an
untoward
piece
of
fortune
should
confront
him
just
at
the
moment
when
this
great
reward
for
his
political
services
was
within
his
grasp
and
his
opportunities
for
eminent
public
usefulness
assured
he
brooded
over
his
quandary
in
silence
for
hours
on
the
second
day
he
concluded
to
speak
of
the
matter
to
selma
he
knew
that
she
kept
a
general
run
of
public
affairs
not
infrequently
she
had
asked
him
questions
concerning
measures
before
the
legislature
and
he
was
pleasantly
aware
that
she
was
ambitious
to
be
regarded
as
a
politician
but
up
to
this
time
there
had
been
no
room
for
question
as
to
what
his
action
as
governor
should
be
in
respect
to
any
measure
it
had
happened
despite
his
attitude
of
mental
comradeship
with
his
wife
that
he
had
hitherto
concealed
from
her
his
most
secret
transactions
he
had
left
her
in
the
dark
in
regard
to
his
true
dealings
with
williams
van
horne
he
had
told
her
nothing
as
to
his
straitened
circumstances
the
compact
by
which
he
had
been
made
governor
and
his
relief
at
the
hands
of
elton
from
threatened
financial
ruin
reluctance
born
of
the
theory
in
his
soul
that
these
were
accidents
in
his
life
not
typical
happenings
had
sealed
his
lips
he
was
going
to
confide
in
her
now
not
because
he
expected
that
selma
view
of
this
emergency
would
differ
from
his
own
but
in
order
that
she
might
learn
before
he
acted
that
he
was
under
an
imperative
obligation
to
sign
the
bill
while
he
was
sitting
at
home
in
the
evening
with
the
topic
trembling
on
his
tongue
selma
made
his
confession
easy
by
saying
i
have
taken
for
granted
that
you
will
veto
the
gas
bill
selma
had
indeed
so
assumed
in
the
early
stages
of
the
bill
she
had
been
ignorant
of
its
existence
during
the
last
fortnight
since
the
controversy
had
reached
an
acute
phase
and
public
sentiment
had
been
aroused
against
its
passage
she
had
been
hoping
that
it
would
pass
so
that
lyons
might
have
the
glory
of
returning
it
to
the
legislature
without
his
signature
she
had
reasoned
that
he
would
be
certain
to
veto
the
measure
for
the
bill
was
clearly
in
the
interest
of
monopoly
and
though
her
nerves
were
all
on
edge
with
excitement
over
the
impending
election
of
a
senator
she
had
not
interfered
because
she
took
for
granted
that
it
was
unnecessary
even
when
lyons
after
reading
the
article
in
the
had
dropped
the
remark
that
the
measure
was
really
harmless
and
the
outcry
against
it
unwarranted
she
had
supposed
that
he
was
merely
seeking
to
be
magnanimous
she
had
forgotten
this
speech
until
it
was
recalled
by
lyons
obvious
state
of
worry
during
the
last
few
days
she
had
noticed
this
at
first
without
special
concern
believing
it
due
to
the
malicious
insinuations
of
stringer
now
that
the
bill
was
before
him
for
signature
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
his
action
nevertheless
her
heart
had
suddenly
been
assailed
by
a
horrible
doubt
and
straightway
her
sense
of
duty
as
a
wife
and
of
duty
to
herself
had
sought
assurance
in
a
crucial
inquiry
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
that
this
evening
i
wish
to
tell
you
the
reasons
which
oblige
me
to
sign
the
bill
he
answered
manner
was
subdued
and
limp
even
his
phraseology
had
been
stripped
of
its
stateliness
sign
the
bill
gasped
selma
if
you
sign
it
you
will
lose
the
senatorship
she
spoke
like
a
prophetess
and
her
steely
eyes
snapped
that
is
liable
to
be
the
consequence
i
know
i
will
explain
to
you
selma
you
will
see
that
i
am
bound
in
honor
and
can
not
help
myself
in
honor
you
are
bound
in
honor
to
your
party
bound
in
honor
to
me
to
veto
it
wait
a
minute
selma
you
must
hear
my
reasons
before
i
was
nominated
for
governor
i
gave
horace
elton
my
word
man
to
man
that
i
would
sign
this
gas
bill
it
is
his
bill
i
promised
if
i
were
elected
governor
not
to
veto
it
at
the
time
i
i
was
financially
embarrassed
i
did
not
tell
you
because
i
was
unwilling
to
distress
you
but
er
my
affairs
in
new
york
were
in
disorder
and
i
had
notes
here
coming
due
nothing
was
said
about
money
matters
between
elton
and
me
until
he
had
agreed
to
support
me
as
governor
then
he
offered
to
help
me
and
i
accepted
his
aid
do
you
see
that
i
can
not
help
myself
that
i
must
sign
the
bill
selma
had
listened
in
amazement
it
a
trap
she
murmured
horace
elton
has
led
you
into
a
trap
the
thought
that
elton
politeness
to
her
was
a
blind
and
that
she
had
been
made
sport
of
took
precedence
in
her
resentment
even
of
the
annoyance
caused
her
by
her
husband
deceit
why
did
you
conceal
all
this
from
me
she
asked
tragically
i
should
not
have
done
so
perhaps
if
you
had
told
me
this
difficulty
never
would
have
arisen
pshaw
it
is
not
a
real
difficulty
surely
you
must
throw
elton
over
surely
you
must
veto
the
bill
throw
him
over
stammered
lyons
you
do
understand
selma
i
gave
my
word
as
a
business
man
i
am
under
great
obligations
to
him
he
told
briefly
the
details
of
the
transaction
even
the
hypothecation
of
the
parsons
bonds
for
once
in
his
life
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
his
bosom
perilous
stuff
he
was
ready
to
bear
the
consequences
of
his
plight
rather
than
be
false
to
his
man
standard
of
honor
and
yet
his
wife
opposition
had
fascinated
as
well
as
startled
him
he
set
forth
his
case
the
case
which
meant
his
political
checkmate
then
waited
selma
had
risen
and
stood
with
folded
arms
gazing
into
distance
with
the
far
away
look
by
which
she
was
wont
to
subdue
mountains
have
you
finished
she
asked
what
you
are
proposing
to
do
is
to
sacrifice
your
life
and
my
life
james
lyons
for
the
sake
of
a
er
fetish
horace
elton
under
the
pretence
of
friendship
for
us
has
taken
advantage
of
your
necessities
to
extract
from
you
a
promise
to
support
an
evil
scheme
a
bill
to
defraud
the
plain
american
people
of
their
rights
the
people
whose
interests
you
swore
to
protect
when
you
took
the
oath
as
governor
is
a
promise
between
man
and
man
as
you
call
it
more
sacred
than
everlasting
truth
itself
more
binding
than
the
tie
of
principle
and
political
good
faith
will
you
refuse
to
veto
a
bill
which
you
know
is
a
blow
at
liberty
in
order
to
keep
a
technical
business
compact
with
an
capitalist
who
has
no
sympathy
with
our
ideas
i
am
disappointed
in
you
james
i
thought
you
could
see
clearer
than
that
lyons
sighed
i
examined
the
bill
at
the
time
with
some
care
and
did
not
think
it
inimical
to
the
best
public
interest
but
had
i
foreseen
the
objections
which
would
be
raised
against
it
i
admit
that
i
never
would
have
agreed
to
sign
it
precisely
you
were
taken
in
she
meant
in
her
heart
that
they
had
both
been
taken
in
this
is
not
a
case
of
commercial
give
and
take
of
purchase
and
sale
of
stocks
or
merchandise
the
eternal
verities
are
concerned
you
owe
it
to
your
country
to
break
your
word
the
triumph
of
american
principles
is
paramount
to
your
obligation
to
elton
whom
will
this
gas
bill
benefit
but
the
promoters
your
view
james
is
the
view
just
as
i
said
to
you
the
other
day
that
dr
page
is
in
his
views
of
medicine
so
it
seems
to
me
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so
you
are
in
this
instance
behind
the
times
and
you
are
not
usually
behind
the
times
it
has
been
one
of
the
joyous
features
of
my
marriage
with
you
that
you
have
not
lacked
american
initiative
and
independence
of
conventions
i
wish
you
had
confided
in
me
you
were
forced
to
give
that
promise
by
your
financial
distress
will
you
let
an
theory
of
private
honor
make
you
a
traitor
to
our
party
cause
and
to
the
sovereign
people
of
our
country
lyons
bowed
his
head
between
his
hands
you
make
me
see
that
there
are
two
sides
to
the
question
selma
it
is
true
that
i
was
not
myself
when
elton
got
my
promise
to
sign
the
bill
my
mind
had
been
on
the
rack
for
weeks
and
i
was
unfit
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
a
complicated
public
measure
but
a
promise
is
a
promise
what
can
he
do
if
you
break
it
he
will
not
kill
you
he
will
not
kill
me
no
but
he
will
despise
me
lyons
reflected
as
he
spoke
that
elton
would
be
unable
to
injure
him
financially
he
would
be
able
to
pay
his
notes
when
they
became
due
thanks
to
the
improvement
in
business
affairs
which
had
set
in
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
your
party
the
american
people
will
despise
you
if
you
sign
the
bill
whose
contempt
do
you
fear
the
most
i
see
i
see
he
murmured
i
can
not
deny
there
is
much
force
in
your
argument
dear
i
fear
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
i
let
the
bill
become
law
public
clamor
will
oblige
the
party
to
throw
me
over
and
take
up
stringer
or
some
dark
horse
that
means
a
serious
setback
to
my
political
progress
means
perhaps
my
political
ruin
your
political
suicide
james
and
there
is
another
side
to
it
continued
selma
pathetically
my
side
i
wish
you
to
think
of
that
i
wish
you
to
realize
that
if
you
yield
to
this
false
notion
of
honor
you
will
interfere
with
the
development
of
my
life
no
less
than
your
own
as
you
know
i
think
i
became
your
wife
because
i
felt
that
as
a
public
woman
working
at
your
side
in
behalf
of
the
high
purposes
in
which
we
had
a
common
sympathy
i
should
be
a
greater
power
for
good
than
if
i
pursued
alone
my
career
as
a
writer
and
on
the
lecture
platform
until
i
have
felt
sure
that
i
had
made
no
mistake
that
we
had
made
no
mistake
without
disrespect
to
the
dead
i
may
say
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
marriage
has
meant
to
me
what
it
should
mean
and
has
tended
to
bring
out
the
best
which
is
in
me
i
have
grown
i
have
developed
i
have
been
recognized
we
have
both
made
progress
only
a
few
days
ago
i
was
rejoicing
to
think
that
when
you
became
a
united
states
senator
there
would
be
a
noble
field
for
my
abilities
as
well
as
yours
we
are
called
to
high
office
called
to
battle
for
great
principles
and
to
lead
the
nation
to
worthy
things
and
now
in
a
moment
of
mental
blindness
you
are
threatening
to
spoil
all
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
james
be
convinced
that
you
do
not
see
clearly
do
not
snatch
the
cup
of
happiness
from
my
lips
just
as
at
last
it
is
full
give
me
the
chance
to
live
my
own
life
as
i
wish
to
live
it
there
was
a
brief
silence
lyons
rose
and
let
fall
his
hand
on
the
table
with
impressive
emphasis
his
mobile
face
was
working
with
emotion
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
i
will
veto
the
bill
he
said
grandiloquently
the
claims
of
private
honor
must
give
way
to
the
general
welfare
and
the
demands
of
civilization
you
have
convinced
me
selma
my
wife
my
point
of
view
was
superior
ethics
permit
no
other
solution
of
the
problem
superior
ethics
he
repeated
as
though
the
phrase
gave
him
comfort
would
not
justify
a
statesman
in
sacrificing
his
party
and
his
own
powers
aye
and
his
political
conscience
in
order
to
keep
a
private
compact
i
shall
veto
the
bill
thank
god
for
that
she
murmured
lyons
stepped
forward
and
put
his
arm
around
her
you
shall
live
your
own
life
as
you
desire
selma
no
act
of
mine
shall
spoil
it
superior
ethics
taught
you
by
your
wife
your
poor
wise
wife
in
whom
you
would
not
confide
she
tapped
him
playfully
on
his
fat
cheek
naughty
boy
there
are
moments
when
a
man
sees
through
a
glass
darkly
he
answered
kissing
her
again
this
is
a
solemn
decision
for
us
selma
heaven
has
willed
that
you
should
save
me
from
my
own
errors
and
my
own
blindness
we
shall
be
very
happy
james
you
will
be
chosen
senator
and
all
will
be
as
it
should
be
the
clouds
on
my
horizon
are
one
by
one
passing
away
and
justice
is
prevailing
at
last
what
do
you
suppose
i
heard
pauline
littleton
is
to
marry
dr
page
earle
told
me
so
pauline
has
written
to
the
trustees
that
after
the
first
of
next
january
she
will
cease
to
serve
as
president
of
wetmore
that
by
that
time
the
college
will
be
running
smoothly
so
that
a
successor
can
take
up
the
work
there
is
a
chance
now
that
the
trustees
will
choose
a
genuine
educator
for
the
place
some
woman
of
spontaneous
impulses
and
a
large
outlook
on
life
pauline
place
is
by
the
domestic
hearth
she
could
never
have
much
influence
on
progress
i
do
not
know
her
very
well
said
lyons
but
i
know
this
selma
you
would
be
just
the
woman
for
the
place
if
you
were
not
my
wife
you
would
make
an
ideal
president
of
a
college
for
progressive
women
i
am
suited
for
the
work
and
i
think
i
am
progressive
she
admitted
but
that
of
course
is
out
of
the
question
for
me
as
a
married
woman
and
the
wife
of
a
united
states
senator
but
i
am
glad
james
to
have
you
appreciate
my
strong
points
on
the
following
day
lyons
vetoed
the
gas
bill
his
message
to
the
legislature
described
it
as
a
measure
which
disposed
of
a
valuable
franchise
for
nothing
and
which
would
create
a
monopoly
detrimental
to
the
rights
of
the
public
this
action
met
with
much
public
approval
one
newspaper
expressed
well
the
feeling
of
the
community
by
declaring
that
the
governor
had
faced
the
issue
squarely
and
shown
the
courage
of
his
convictions
the
benham
was
practically
mute
it
stated
merely
in
a
short
editorial
that
it
was
disappointed
in
governor
lyons
and
that
he
had
played
into
the
hands
of
the
demagogues
and
the
sentimentalists
it
suggested
to
the
legislature
to
show
commendable
independence
by
passing
the
bill
over
his
veto
but
this
was
obviously
a
vain
hope
the
vote
in
the
house
against
the
veto
not
merely
fell
short
of
the
requisite
but
was
less
than
a
plurality
showing
that
the
action
of
the
chief
magistrate
had
reversed
the
sentiment
of
the
legislature
the
force
of
stringer
opposition
was
practically
killed
by
the
governor
course
he
had
staked
everything
on
the
chance
that
lyons
would
see
fit
to
sign
the
bill
when
the
party
caucus
for
the
choice
of
a
candidate
for
senator
was
held
a
few
days
later
his
followers
recognized
the
hopelessness
of
his
ambition
and
prevailed
on
him
to
withdraw
his
name
from
consideration
lyons
was
elected
senator
of
the
united
states
by
a
party
vote
by
the
two
branches
of
the
legislature
assembled
in
solemn
conclave
apparently
elton
had
realized
that
opposition
was
useless
and
that
he
must
bide
his
time
for
revenge
booming
cannon
celebrated
the
result
of
the
proceedings
and
selma
waiting
at
home
on
the
river
drive
received
a
telegram
from
the
capital
announcing
the
glad
news
her
husband
was
united
states
senator
and
the
future
stretched
before
her
big
with
promise
she
had
battled
with
life
she
had
suffered
she
had
held
fast
to
her
principles
and
at
last
she
was
rewarded
lyons
returned
to
benham
by
the
afternoon
train
and
a
salute
of
one
hundred
guns
greeted
him
on
his
arrival
he
walked
from
the
station
like
any
private
citizen
frequent
cheers
attended
his
progress
to
his
house
in
the
evening
the
shops
and
public
buildings
were
illuminated
and
the
james
lyons
cadets
who
considered
themselves
partly
responsible
for
his
rapid
promotion
led
a
congratulatory
crowd
to
the
river
drive
the
in
response
to
the
music
of
a
serenade
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
selma
waited
behind
the
window
curtain
until
the
enthusiasm
had
subsided
then
she
glided
forth
and
showed
herself
at
his
elbow
a
fresh
round
of
cheers
for
the
senator
wife
followed
it
was
a
glorious
night
the
moon
shone
brightly
the
street
was
thronged
by
the
populace
and
glittered
with
the
torches
of
the
cadets
lyons
stood
bareheaded
his
large
round
smooth
face
glistened
and
the
moonbeams
bathing
his
chin
beard
gave
him
the
effect
of
a
patriarch
or
of
one
inspired
he
raised
his
hand
to
induce
silence
then
stood
for
a
moment
as
was
his
habit
before
speaking
with
an
expression
as
though
he
were
struggling
with
emotion
or
busy
in
silent
prayer
fellow
citizens
of
benham
he
began
slowly

the
words
of
this
peroration
with
a
sense
of
ecstasy
she
felt
that
he
was
speaking
for
them
both
and
that
he
was
expressing
the
yearning
intention
of
her
soul
to
attempt
and

straight
before

with
her
far

paradise
