was
it
not
who
said
that
all

works
produce
an
unpleasant
impression
on

acquaintance
it
is
so
with
the

river
carlyle
was
not
i
think
speaking
of
rivers
but
he
was
speaking
of
masterpieces
and
so
am
i
it
makes
little
difference
to
me
whether
or
not
an
epic
goes
at
a
hexameter
gallop
through
the
ages
or
whether
it
chooses
to
be
a
flood
of
muddy
water
ripping
out
a
channel
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
how
the
great
dynamic
force
shall
express
itself
i
have
seen
trout
streams
that
i
thought
were
better
lyrics
than
i
or
any
of
my
fellows
can
ever
hope
to
create
i
have
heard
the
moaning
of
rain
winds
among
mountain
pines
that
struck
me
as
being
equal
at
least
to
i
have
seen
the
solemn
rearing
of
a
mountain
peak
into
the
pale
dawn
that
gave
me
a
deep
religious
appreciation
of
my
significance
in
the
grand
scheme
as
though
i
had
heard
and
understood
a
parable
from
the
holy
lips
of
an
avatar
and
the
vast
plains
of
my
native
country
are
as
a
mystic
scroll
unrolled
scrawled
with
a
cabalistic
writ
of
infinite
things
in
the
same
sense
i
have
come
to
look
upon
the
missouri
as
something
more
than
a
stream
of
muddy
water
it
gave
me
my
first
big
boy
dreams
it
was
my
ocean
i
remember
well
the
first
time
i
looked
upon
my
turbulent
friend
who
has
since
become
as
a
brother
to
me
it
was
from
a
bluff
at
kansas
city
i
know
i
must
have
been
a
very
little
boy
for
the
terror
i
felt
made
me
reach
up
to
the
saving
forefinger
of
my
father
lest
this
insane
before
me
should
suddenly
develop
an
unreasoning
hunger
for
little
boys
my
father
seemed
as
tall
as
alexander
and
quite
as
courageous
he
seemed
to
fear
it
almost
not
at
all
and
i
should
have
felt
little
surprise
had
he
taken
me
in
his
arms
and
stepped
easily
over
that
mile
or
so
of
liquid
madness
he
talked
calmly
about
it
quite
calmly
he
explained
at
what
angle
one
should
hold
one
body
in
the
current
and
how
one
should
conduct
one
legs
and
arms
in
the
whirlpools
providing
one
should
swim
across
across
why
it
took
a
giant
even
to
talk
that
way
for
the
summer
had
smitten
the
distant
mountains
and
the
june
floods
ran
far
across
the
yellow
swirl
that
spread
out
into
the
wooded
we
watched
the
demolition
of
a
little
town
the
siege
had
reached
the
proper
stage
for
a
sally
and
the
attacking
forces
were
howling
over
the
walls
the
sacking
was
in
progress
shacks
stores
outhouses
suddenly
developed
a
frantic
desire
to
go
to
louis
it
was
a
weird
retreat
in
very
bad
order
a
cottage
with
a
garret
window
that
glared
like
the
eye
of
a
cyclops
trembled
rocked
with
the
athletic
lift
of
the
flood
made
a
panicky
plunge
into
a
convenient
tree
groaned
dodged
and
took
off
through
the
brush
like
a
scared
cottontail
i
felt
a
boy
pity
and
sympathy
for
those
houses
that
got
up
and
took
to
their
legs
across
the
yellow
waste
it
did
not
seem
fair
i
have
since
experienced
the
same
feeling
for
a
with
the
hounds
at
its
heels
but
to
this
thing
to
fight
this
cruel
invulnerable
resistless
giant
that
went
roaring
down
the
world
with
a
huge
uprooted
oak
tree
in
its
mouth
for
a
toothpick
this
yellow
sinuous
beast
with
slavering
from
its
jaws
this
that
sauntered
along
with
a
town
in
its
pocket
and
a
steepled
church
under
its
arm
for
a
moment
toy
swim
for
days
i
marvelled
at
the
magnificence
of
being
a
fullgrown
man
unafraid
of
big
rivers
but
the
first
sight
of
the
missouri
river
was
not
enough
for
me
there
was
a
dreadful
fascination
about
it
the
fascination
of
all
huge
and
irresistible
things
i
had
caught
my
first
wee
glimpse
into
the
infinite
i
was
six
years
old
many
a
lazy
sunday
stroll
took
us
back
to
the
river
and
little
by
little
the
dread
became
less
and
the
wonder
grew
and
a
little
love
crept
in
in
my
boy
heart
i
condoned
its
treachery
and
its
giant
sins
for
after
all
it
sinned
through
excess
of
strength
not
through
weakness
and
that
is
the
eternal
way
of
virile
things
we
watched
the
steamboats
loading
for
what
seemed
to
me
far
distant
ports
how
the
world
shrinks
a
double
stream
of
roosters
coming
and
going
at
a
rushed
the
freight
aboard
and
at
the
foot
of
the
the
mate
swore
masterfully
while
the
perspiration
dripped
from
the
point
of
his
nose
and
then
the
raucous
whistles
blew
they
reminded
me
of
the
lions
roaring
at
the
circus
the
went
up
the
hawsers
went
in
the
snub
nose
of
the
steamer
swung
out
with
a
quiet
majesty
now
she
feels
the
urge
of
the
flood
and
yields
herself
to
it
already
dwindled
to
half
her
size
the
pilot
turns
his
wheel
he
looks
very
big
and
quiet
and
masterful
up
there
the
boat
veers
round
bells
jangle
and
now
the
engine
wakens
in
earnest
she
breathes
with
spurts
of
vapor
breathed
no
it
was
sighing
for
about
it
all
clung
an
inexplicable
sadness
for
me
the
sadness
that
clings
about
all
strong
and
beautiful
things
that
must
leave
their
moorings
and
go
very
very
far
away
i
have
since
heard
it
said
that
river
boats
are
not
beautiful
my
throat
felt
as
though
it
had
smoke
in
it
i
felt
that
this
queenly
thing
really
wanted
to
stay
for
far
down
the
muddy
swirl
where
she
dwindled
dwindled
i
heard
her
sobbing
hoarsely
off
on
the
perilous
flood
for
faÃ«rie
lands
forlorn
it
made
the
world
seem
almost
empty
and
very
lonesome
and
then
the
came
and
i
saw
my
river
tawny
sinewy
gaunt
a
lion
the
long
dry
bars
were
like
the
protruding
ribs
of
the
beast
when
the
prey
is
scarce
and
the
ropy
main
current
was
like
the
lean
terrible
muscles
of
its
back
in
the
spring
it
had
roared
now
it
only
purred
but
all
the
while
i
felt
in
it
a
dreadful
economy
of
force
just
as
i
have
since
felt
it
in
the
presence
of
a
great
lean
at
the
zoo
here
was
a
thing
that
crouched
and
purred
a
mewing
but
terrific
thing
give
it
an
obstacle
to
overcome
fling
it
something
to
devour
and
lo
the
crushing
impact
of
its
leap
and
then
again
i
saw
it
lying
very
quietly
in
the
clutch
of
a
bitter
winter
an
awful
hush
upon
it
and
the
white
cerement
of
the
snow
flung
across
its
face
and
yet
this
did
not
seem
like
death
for
still
one
felt
in
it
the
subtle
influence
of
a
tremendous
personality
it
slept
but
sleeping
it
was
still
a
giant
it
seemed
that
at
any
moment
the
sleeper
might
turn
over
toss
the
white
cover
aside
and
yawning
saunter
down
the
valley
with
its
thunderous
boots
and
still
back
and
forth
across
this
heavy
sleeper
went
the
pigmy
wagons
of
the
farmers
taking
corn
to
market

illustration
the
boats

gorge
but
one
day
in
march
the
arrows
of
the
geese
went
over
honk
a
vague
prophetic
sense
crept
into
the
world
out
of
nowhere
part
sound
part
scent
and
yet
too
vague
for
either
sap
seeped
from
the
maples
weird
went
moaning
through
the
night
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
saw
my
big
brother
win
a
fight
for
days
strange
premonitory
noises
had
run
across
the
shivering
surface
of
the
ice
through
the
foggy
nights
a
muffled
intermittent
booming
went
on
under
the
wild
scurrying
stars
now
and
then
a
staccato
crackling
ran
up
the
icy
reaches
of
the
river
like
the
sequent
bickering
of
krags
down
a
firing
line
long
seams
opened
in
the
disturbed
surface
and
from
them
came
a
harsh
sibilance
as
of
a
line
of
cavalry
unsheathing
sabres
but
all
the
while
no
show
of
violence
only
the
awful
quietness
with
deluge
potential
in
it
the
lion
was
crouching
for
the
leap
then
one
day
under
the
warm
sun
a
booming
as
of
distant
big
guns
began
faster
and
louder
came
the
dull
shaking
thunders
and
passed
swiftly
up
and
down
drawling
into
the
distance
fissures
yawned
and
the
sound
of
the
grumbling
black
water
beneath
came
up
here
and
there
the
surface
lifted
bent
broke
with
shriekings
groanings
thunderings
and
then
the
giant
turned
over
yawned
and
got
to
his
feet
flinging
his
arms
about
him
barriers
formed
before
him
confidently
he
set
his
massive
shoulders
against
them
smashed
them
into
little
blocks
and
went
on
singing
shouting
toward
the
sea
it
was
a
glorious
victory
it
made
me
very
proud
of
my
big
brother
and
yet
all
the
while
i
dreaded
him
just
as
i
dread
the
caged
tiger
that
i
long
to
caress
because
he
is
so
strong
and
so
beautiful
since
then
i
have
changed
somewhat
though
i
am
hardly
as
tall
and
certainly
not
so
courageous
as
alexander
but
i
have
felt
the
sinews
of
the
old
yellow
giant
tighen
about
my
naked
body
i
have
been
bent
upon
his
hip
i
have
presumed
to
throw
against
his
titan
strength
the
craft
of
man
i
have
often
swum
in
what
seemed
liquid
madness
to
my
boyhood
and
we
have
become
acquainted
through
battle
no
friends
like
fair
foes
reconciled
and
i
have
been
panting
on
his
bars
while
all
about
me
went
the
lisping
laughter
of
my
brother
for
he
has
the
strength
of
a
god
the
headlong
temper
of
a
comet
but
along
with
these
he
has
the
glad
mad
irresponsible
spirit
of
a
boy
thus
ever
are
the
epic
things
the
missouri
is
unique
among
rivers
i
think
god
wished
to
teach
the
beauty
of
a
virile
soul
fighting
its
way
toward
peace
and
his
precept
was
the
missouri
to
me
the
amazon
is
a
basking
alligator
the
tiber
is
a
dream
of
dead
glory
the
rhine
is
a
fantastic
the
nile
a
mummy
periodically
resurrected
the
mississippi
a
convenient
geographical
boundary
line
the
hudson
an
epicurean
philosopher
but
the
missouri
my
brother
is
the
eternal
fighting
man
i
love
things
that
yearn
toward
far
seas
the
singing
tennysonian
brooks
that
flow
by
philip
farm
but
go
on
forever
the
little
ik
walton
rivers
where
one
may
study
to
be
quiet
and
go
the
babylonian
streams
by
which
we
have
all
pined
in
captivity
the
sentimental
danube
which
we
can
never
forget
because
of
that
night
in
june
and
at
a
very
early
age
i
had
already
developed
a
decent
respect
for
the
verbose
manner
in
which
the
waters
come
down
at
lodore
but
the
missouri
is
more
than
a
sentiment
even
more
than
an
epic
it
is
the
symbol
of
my
own
soul
which
is
i
surmise
not
unlike
other
souls
in
it
i
see
flung
before
me
all
the
stern
struggle
become
materialized
here
is
the
concrete
representation
of
the
earnest
desire
the
momentarily
frustrate
purpose
the
beating
at
the
bars
the
breathless
fighting
of
the
but
spirit
the
sobbing
of
the
runner
the
anger
the
madness
the
laughter
and
in
it
all
the
unwearying
urge
of
a
purpose
the
unswerving
belief
in
the
peace
of
a
far
away
ocean
if
in
a
moment
of
despair
i
should
reel
for
a
breathing
space
away
from
the
fight
with
no
heart
for
and
with
only
a
desire
to
pray
i
could
do
it
in
no
better
manner
than
to
lift
my
arms
above
the
river
and
cry
out
into
the
big
spaces
you
who
somehow
understand
behold
this
river
it
expresses
what
is
voiceless
in
me
it
prays
for
me
not
only
in
its
physical
aspect
does
the
missouri
appeal
to
the
imagination
from
three
forks
to
its
mouth
a
distance
of
three
thousand
miles
this
zigzag
watercourse
is
haunted
with
great
memories
perhaps
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
a
river
been
the
thoroughfare
of
a
movement
so
tremendously
epic
in
its
human
appeal
so
vastly
significant
in
its
relation
to
the
development
of
man
and
in
the
building
of
the
continent
nature
fashioned
well
the
scenery
for
the
great
human
story
that
was
to
be
enacted
here
in
the
fullness
of
years
she
built
her
stage
on
a
large
scale
taking
no
account
of
miles
for
the
coming
actors
were
to
be
big
men
mighty
travelers
intrepid
fighters
laughers
at
time
and
space
plains
limited
only
by
the
rim
of
sky
mountains
severe
huge
tragic
as
fate
deserts
for
the
trying
of
strong
spirits
grotesque
volcanic
lands
dead
utterly
where
athletic
souls
might
struggle
with
despair
impetuous
streams
with
their
rapids
terrible
as
scylla
where
men
might
go
down
fighting
thus
nature
built
the
stage
and
set
the
scenes
and
that
the
arrangements
might
be
complete
she
left
a
vast
tract
unfinished
where
still
the
building
of
the
world
goes
on
a
place
of
awe
in
which
to
feel
the
mighty
doer
of
things
at
work
indeed
a
setting
vast
and
weird
enough
for
the
coming
epic
and
as
the
essence
of
all
story
is
struggle
tribes
of
wild
fighting
men
grew
up
in
the
land
to
oppose
the
coming
masters
and
over
the
limitless
wastes
swept
the
blizzards
i
remember
when
i
first
read
the
words
of
vergil
beginning
tot
where
the
simois
rolls
along
so
many
shields
and
helmets
and
strong
bodies
of
brave
men
snatched
beneath
its
floods
the
sadness
of
the
lines
thrilled
me
for
it
was
not
of
the
little
stream
of
the
that
i
thought
while
the
latin
professor
quizzed
me
as
to
constructions
but
of
that
great
river
of
my
own
epic
country
the
missouri
was
i
unfair
to
old
vergil
think
you
as
for
me
i
think
i
flattered
him
a
bit
and
in
this
modern
application
the
ancient
lines
ring
true
for
the
missouri
from
great
falls
to
its
mouth
is
one
long
grave
of
men
and
boats
and
such
men
it
is
a
habit
to
look
back
through
the
ages
for
the
epic
things
modern
affairs
seem
a
bit
commonplace
to
some
of
us
a
horde
of
tears
down
a
town
in
order
to
avenge
the
theft
of
a
faithless
wife
who
was
probably
no
better
than
she
should
have
been
and
we
have
the
a
petty
king
sets
sail
for
his
native
land
somehow
losing
himself
ten
years
among
the
isles
of
greece
and
we
have
the
i
would
back
a
missouri
river
rat
to
make
the
distance
in
a
row
boat
within
a
few
months
an
argive
captain
returns
home
after
an
absence
of
ten
years
to
find
his
wife
interested
overmuch
in
a
friend
who
went
not
forth
to
battle
a
wrangle
ensues
the
tender
spouse
finishes
her
lord
with
an
axe
and
you
have
the
we
should
merely
have
a
sensational
trial
and
hysterical
scareheads
in
the
newspapers
such
were
the
ancient
stories
that
move
us
all
sordid
enough
be
sure
when
you
push
them
hard
for
fact
but
time
and
genius
have
glorified
them
not
the
deeds
but
homer
and
Ã¦schylus
and
the
hallowing
years
are
great
we
no
longer
write
epics
we
live
them
to
create
an
epic
it
has
been
said
somewhere
the
poet
must
write
with
the
belief
that
the
immortal
gods
are
looking
over
his
shoulder
we
no
longer
prostrate
ourselves
before
the
immortal
gods
we
have
long
since
discovered
the
divinity
within
ourselves
and
so
we
have
flung
across
the
continents
and
the
seas
the
visible
epics
of
will
the
history
of
the
american
fur
trade
alone
makes
the
trojan
war
look
like
a
punch
and
judy
show
and
the
missouri
river
was
the
path
of
the
conquerors
we
have
the
facts
but
we
have
not
homer
an
epic
story
in
its
essence
is
the
story
of
heroic
men
battling
aided
or
frustrated
by
the
superhuman
and
in
the
fur
trade
era
there
was
no
dearth
of
battling
men
and
the
elements
left
no
lack
of
superhuman
obstacles
i
am
more
thrilled
by
the
history
of
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
than
by
the
tale
of
jason
john
colter
wandering
three
years
in
the
wilderness
and
discovering
the
yellowstone
park
is
infinitely
more
heroic
to
me
that
theseus
alexander
harvey
makes
Ã¦neas
look
like
a
degenerate
it
was
harvey
you
know
who
fell
out
with
the
powers
at
fort
union
with
the
result
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
at
the
american
fur
company
office
at
louis
before
he
could
be
reinstated
in
the
service
this
was
at
christmas
time
christmas
of
a
western
winter
the
distance
was
seventeen
hundred
miles
as
the
crow
flies
give
me
a
dog
to
carry
my
blankets
said
he
and
by
god
i
report
before
the
ice
goes
out
he
started
afoot
through
the
hostile
tribes
and
blizzards
he
reported
at
louis
early
in
march
returning
to
union
by
the
first
boat
out
that
year
and
when
he
arrived
at
the
fort
he
called
out
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
the
trouble
and
quietly
killed
him
that
is
the
stern
human
stuff
with
which
you
build
realms
what
could
not
homer
do
with
such
a
man
and
when
one
follows
him
through
his
recorded
career
even
achilles
seems
a
bit
ladylike
beside
him
the
killing
of
carpenter
by
his
treacherous
friend
mike
fink
would
easily
make
a
whole
book
of
hexameters
with
a
nice
assortment
of
gods
and
goddesses
thrown
in
there
was
a
woman
in
the
case
a
well
this
woman
fascinates
me
quite
as
much
as
she
whose
face
launched
a
thousand
ships
and
burnt
the
topless
towers
of
ilium
in
ancient
times
the
immortal
gods
scourged
nations
for
impieties
and
as
we
read
we
feel
the
black
shadow
of
inexorable
fate
moving
through
the
terrific
gloom
of
things
but
the
smallpox
scourge
that
broke
out
at
fort
union
in
sweeping
with
desolation
through
the
prairie
tribes
moves
me
more
than
the
storied
catastrophes
of
old
it
was
a
reign
of
terror
even
larpenteur
bald
statement
of
it
fills
me
with
the
fine
old
greek
sense
of
fate
men
sickened
at
dawn
and
were
dead
at
sunset
every
day
a
cartload
or
two
of
corpses
went
over
the
bluff
into
the
river
and
men
became
reckless
larpenteur
and
his
friend
joked
daily
about
the
carting
of
the
gruesome
freight
they
felt
the
irresistible
and
they
laughed
at
it
since
struggle
was
out
of
the
question
some
drank
deeply
and
indulged
in
hysterical
orgies
some
hollowed
out
their
own
graves
and
waited
patiently
beside
them
for
the
hidden
hand
to
strike
at
least
fifteen
thousand
died
audubon
says
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
the
buffalo
increased
rapidly
because
the
hunters
were
few
would
not
such
a
story
here
briefly
sketched
move
old
sophocles
the
story
of
the
woman
a
giantess
who
had
a
dozen
sons
has
about
it
for
me
all
the
glamour
of
an
ancient
yarn
the
sons
were
you
know
and
incidentally
thieves
and
murderers
i
suspect
some
of
our
classic
heroes
were
as
much
but
they
were
doubtless
living
up
to
the
light
that
was
in
them
and
they
were
game
to
the
finish
so
was
the
old
woman
they
called
her
the
mother
of
the
devils
trappers
from
the
various
posts
organized
to
hunt
them
down
and
the
mother
and
the
sons
barricaded
their
home
the
fight
was
a
hard
one
one
by
one
the
devils
fell
fighting
about
their
mother
and
then
the
besieging
party
fired
the
house
with
all
her
sons
wounded
or
dead
the
old
woman
sallied
forth
she
fought
like
a
grizzly
and
went
down
like
a
heroine
a
sordid
brutal
story
ah
but
it
was
life
fling
about
this
story
of
savage
the
glamour
of
time
and
genius
and
it
will
move
you
and
the
story
of
old
hugh
glass
is
it
not
fateful
enough
to
be
the
foundation
of
a
tremendous
Ã¦schylean
drama
a
big
man
he
was
old
and
bearded
a
devil
to
fight
a
giant
to
endure
and
an
angel
to
forgive
he
was
in
the
leavenworth
campaign
against
the
aricaras
and
afterward
he
went
as
a
hunter
with
the
henry
expedition
he
had
a
friend
a
mere
boy
and
these
two
were
very
close
one
day
glass
who
was
in
advance
of
the
party
beating
up
the
country
for
game
fell
in
with
a
grizzly
and
when
the
main
party
came
up
he
lay
horribly
mangled
with
the
bear
standing
over
him
they
killed
the
bear
but
the
old
man
seemed
done
for
his
face
had
all
the
features
scraped
off
and
one
of
his
legs
went
wabbly
when
they
lifted
him
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
one
more
man
being
dead
so
the
expedition
pushed
on
leaving
the
young
friend
with
several
others
to
see
the
old
man
under
ground
but
the
old
man
was
a
fighter
and
refused
to
die
though
he
was
unconscious
held
on
stubbornly
for
several
days
but
it
seemed
plain
enough
that
he
would
have
to
let
go
soon
so
the
young
friend
and
the
others
left
the
old
man
in
the
wilderness
to
finish
up
the
job
by
himself
they
took
his
weapons
and
hastened
after
the
main
party
for
the
country
was
hostile
but
one
day
old
glass
woke
up
and
got
one
of
his
eyes
open
and
when
he
saw
how
things
stood
he
swore
to
god
he
would
live
merely
for
the
sake
of
killing
his
false
friend
he
crawled
to
a
spring
near
by
where
he
found
a
bush
of
ripe
he
waited
day
after
day
for
strength
and
finally
started
out
to
a
small
matter
of
one
hundred
miles
to
the
nearest
fort
and
he
did
it
too
also
he
found
his
friend
after
much
wandering
and
forgave
him
fancy
Ã¦schylus
working
up
that
story
with
the
furies
for
a
chorus

intervals

and
le

the
famous

whose
biography
reads
like
a
romance
in
the
history
of
the
missouri
river
there
were
hundreds
of
these
heroes
these
builders
of
the
epic
west
some
of
them
were
violent
at
times
some
were
good
men
and
some
were
bad
but
they
were
masterful
always
they
met
obstacles
and
overcame
them
they
struck
their
foes
in
front
they
thirsted
in
deserts
hungered
in
the
wilderness
froze
in
the
blizzards
died
with
the
plagues
and
were
massacred
by
the
savages
yet
they
conquered
heroes
of
an
unwritten
epic
and
their
pathway
to
defeat
and
victory
was
the
missouri
river
if
you
wish
to
have
your
epic
spiced
with
the
glamour
of
kings
the
history
of
the
river
will
not
fail
you
for
in
those
days
there
were
kings
as
well
as
giants
in
the
land
though
it
was
not
called
such
all
the
blank
space
of
the
map
of
the
missouri
river
country
and
even
to
the
pacific
was
one
vast
empire
the
empire
of
the
american
fur
company
and
astor
in
new
york
spoke
the
words
that
filled
the
wilderness
with
deeds
thus
democratic
america
once
beheld
within
her
own
confines
the
paradox
of
an
empire
truly
roman
in
character
here
and
there
on
the
banks
of
the
great
waterway
an
imperial
road
that
would
have
delighted
cÃ¦sar
many
forts
were
built
these
were
the
ganglia
of
that
tremendous
organism
of
which
astor
was
the
brain
the
bourgeois
of
one
of
these
posts
was
virtually
proconsul
with
absolute
power
in
his
territory
mackenzie
at
union
which
might
be
called
the
capital
of
the
upper
missouri
country
was
called
king
of
the
missouri
he
had
an
eye
for
seeing
purple
at
one
time
he
ordered
a
complete
suit
of
armor
from
england
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
have
medals
struck
in
true
imperial
fashion
to
be
distributed
among
his
loyal
followers
far
and
wide
these
western
american
kings
flung
the
trappers
their
subjects
into
the
wilderness
verily
in
the
unwritten
missouriad
there
is
no
lack
of
regal
glamour
the
ancients
had
a
way
of
making
vast
things
small
enough
to
be
familiar
they
make
gods
of
the
elements
and
natural
phenomena
became
to
them
the
awful
acts
of
the
gods
these
moderns
made
no
gods
of
the
elements
they
merely
conquered
them
the
ancients
idealized
the
material
these
moderns
materialized
the
ideal
the
latter
method
is
much
more
appealing
to
me
an
american
than
the
former
i
love
the
ancient
stories
but
it
is
for
the
modern
marvellous
facts
that
i
reserve
my
admiration
when
one
looks
upon
his
own
country
as
from
a
height
of
years
old
tales
lose
something
of
their
wonder
for
him
it
is
owing
to
this
attitude
that
the
prospect
of
descending
the
great
river
in
a
power
canoe
from
the
head
of
navigation
gave
me
delight
days
and
nights
filled
with
the
singing
and
muttering
of
my
big
brother
and
i
would
need
only
to
close
my
eyes
and
all
about
me
would
come
and
go
the
ghosts
of
the
mighty
doers
who
are
my
kin
big
men
bearded
and
powerful
pushing
up
stream
with
the
cordelle
on
their
shoulders
voyageurs
chanting
at
the
paddles
mackinaws
descending
with
precious
freights
of
furs
steamboats
grunting
and
snoring
up
stream
old
forts
sprung
up
again
out
of
the
dusk
of
things
forgotten
with
all
the
old
turbulent
life
where
in
reality
the
plough
of
the
farmer
goes
or
the
steers
browse
forgotten
battles
blowing
by
in
the
wind
and
from
a
bluff
summit
here
and
there
ghostly
war
parties
peering
down
upon
me
the
lesser
kin
of
their
old
enemies
taking
a
summer
outing
where
of
old
went
forth
the
fighting
men
the
builders
of
the
unwritten
epic
chapter
ii
sixteen
miles
of
awe
our
party
of
three
left
the
railroad
at
great
falls
a
good
walk
up
river
from
benton
the
head
of
missouri
river
navigation
to
which
point
our
boat
material
had
been
shipped
and
our
baggage
checked
a
vast
waste
of
prickly
pears
and
sagebrush
stretched
before
us
to
the
north
and
east
and
on
the
west
the
filmy
blue
contour
of
the
highwoods
mountains
lifted
like
thunder
clouds
in
the
july
swelter
one
squinting
far
look
however
told
you
that
these
were
not
rain
clouds
the
very
thought
of
rain
came
to
you
with
the
vagueness
of
some
memory
of
a
former
time
you
looked
far
up
and
out
to
the
westward
and
caught
the
glint
of
snow
on
the
higher
peaks
but
the
sight
was
unconvincing
it
was
like
a
story
told
without
the
vital
impulse
always
had
these
plains
blistered
under
this
july
sun
always
had
the
spots
of
alkali
made
the
only
whiteness
and
the
dry
harsh
snarl
and
snap
of
the
grasshoppers
wings
had
pricked
this
torrid
silence
through
all
eternity
a
stern
and
pitiless
prospect
for
the
amateur
pedestrian
to
be
sure
for
devotees
of
the
staff
and
pack
have
come
to
associate
pedestrianism
with
the
idyllic
and
the
idyllic
nourishes
only
in
a
land
of
frequent
showers
theocritus
and
prickly
pears
are
not
compatible
yet
it
was
not
without
a
certain
thrill
of
exaltation
that
we
strapped
on
our
packs
and
stretched
our
legs
after
four
days
on
the
dusty
plush
and
though
ahead
of
us
lay
no
shady
amiably
crooked
country
roads
and
bosky
dells
wherein
one
might
lounge
and
dawdle
over
hazlitt
yet
we
knew
how
crisscross
should
take
us
skirting
down
the
river
sixteen
miles
of
awe
five
hundred
miles
below
its
source
the
falls
of
the
missouri
begin
with
a
vertical
plunge
of
sixty
feet
this
is
the
black
eagle
falls
presumably
named
so
by
lewis
and
clark
and
other
explorers
because
of
the
black
eagles
found
there
with
all
due
courtesy
to
my
big
surly
grumbling
friend
the
black
eagle
falls
i
must
say
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
him
oh
he
is
quite
magnificent
enough
and
every
inch
a
titan
to
be
sure
but
of
late
years
it
seems
he
has
taken
up
with
company
rather
beneath
him
first
of
all
he
has
gone
to
work
in
a
most
plebeian
almost
fashion
turning
wheels
and
making
lights
and
dragging
silly
little
trolley
cars
about
a
straggling
town
also
he
hobnobs
continually
with
a
sprawling
brawling
smelter
as
no
respectable
titan
should
do
and
on
top
of
it
all
and
this
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
back
of
my
sentimental
camel
he
allows
them
to
maintain
a
park
on
the
cliffs
above
him
where
the
merest
pigmy
may
come
of
a
sunday
for
his
glass
of
pop
and
a
careless
squint
at
the
toiling
titan
puny
philistines
eating
peanuts
and
watching
samson
at
his
gaza
stunt
i
like
it
not
rather
would
i
see
the
muse
clio
pealing
potatoes
or
persephone
busy
with
a
banana
cart
encleadus
wriggling
under
a
mountain
is
well
enough
but
enceladus
composedly
turning
a
crank
for
little
men
he
seemed
too
heavy
for
that
light
work
leaning
on
the
frame
observation
platform
i
closed
my
eyes
and
in
the
dull
roar
that
seemed
the
voices
of
countless
ages
the
park
and
the
smelter
and
the
silly
bustling
trolley
cars
and
the
and
the
peanuts
and
my
physical
self
all
but
my
own
soul
were
swallowed
up
i
saw
my
titan
brother
as
he
was
made
four
hundred
yards
of
writhing
liquid
sinew
strenuously
idle
magnificently
worthless
flinging
meaningless
thunders
over
the
vast
arid
plain
splendidly
empty
under
sun
and
stars
i
saw
him
as
la
verendrye
must
have
seen
him
busy
only
at
the
divine
business
of
being
a
giant
and
for
a
moment
behind
shut
eyes
it
seemed
very
inconsequential
to
me
that
cranks
should
be
turned
and
that
trolley
cars
should
run
up
and
down
precisely
in
the
same
place
never
getting
anywhere
and
that
there
should
be
anything
in
all
that
tract
but
an
austere
black
eagle
or
two
and
my
own
soul
and
my
titan
brother
when
i
looked
again
i
could
half
imagine
the
old
turbulent
fellow
winking
slyly
at
me
and
saying
in
that
undertone
you
hear
when
you
forget
the
thunders
for
a
moment
do
you
worry
about
me
little
man
it
all
a
joke
and
i
do
mind
only
and
then
another
and
there
wo
be
any
smelters
or
trolley
cars
or
or
peanuts
or
sentimentalizing
outers
like
yourself
but
i
be
here
howling
under
sun
and
stars
whereupon
i
posed
the
toiling
philosopher
before
the
camera
pressed
the
bulb
and
descended
from
the
summit
of
the
cliff
as
well
as
from
my
point
of
view
to
the
trail
skirting
northward
up
the
river
leaving
encleadus
grumbling
at
his
crank
perhaps
after
all
cranks
really
have
to
be
turned
still
it
seems
too
bad
and
i
have
long
bewailed
it
almost
as
a
personal
grief
that
utility
and
ugliness
should
so
often
be
running
mates
they
tell
me
that
the
matterhorn
never
did
a
tap
of
work
and
you
could
color
one
easter
egg
with
all
the
gorgeous
sunsets
of
the
world
may
we
all
become
some
day
perfectly
useless
and
beautiful
at
the
foot
of
the
first
fall
a
mammoth
spring
wells
up
out
of
the
rock
nobody
tells
you
about
it
you
run
across
it
by
chance
and
it
interests
you
much
more
in
that
way
it
would
seem
that
a
spring
throwing
out
a
stream
equivalent
to
a
river
one
hundred
yards
wide
and
two
feet
deep
would
deserve
a
little
exploitation
down
east
they
would
have
a
great
white
sprawling
hotel
built
close
by
it
wherein
one
could
drink
spring
water
at
a
quarter
the
quart
with
half
a
pathology
pasted
on
the
bottle
as
a
label
but
nobody
seems
to
care
much
about
so
small
an
ooze
out
there
everything
else
is
so
big
and
so
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
but
go
right
on
being
one
of
the
very
biggest
springs
of
all
the
world
this
is
really
something
and
i
like
it
better
than
the
idea
in
sixteen
miles
the
missouri
river
falls
four
hundred
feet
incidentally
this
stretch
of
river
is
said
to
be
capable
of
producing
the
most
tremendous
in
the
world
after
skirting
four
miles
of
water
that
ran
like
a
we
came
upon
the
rainbow
falls
where
a
thousand
feet
of
river
takes
a
drop
of
fifty
feet
over
a
precipice
regular
as
a
wall
of
masonry
this
was
much
more
to
my
liking
a
million
or
so
busy
making
rainbows
bully
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
the
sun
was
now
high
i
sat
down
to
wipe
the
sweat
out
of
my
eyes
i
wished
to
get
acquainted
with
this
weaver
of
iridescent
nothings
who
knew
so
well
the
divine
art
of
doing
nothing
at
all
and
doing
it
good
and
hard
after
all
it
is
so
easy
to
do
nothing
and
make
it
count
and
in
the
end
when
all
broken
lights
have
blended
again
with
the
source
light
i
not
so
sure
that
rainbows
will
seem
less
important
than
rows
and
rows
of
arc
lights
and
clusters
and
clusters
of
incandescent
globes
are
you
i
can
contract
an
indefinable
sort
of
heartache
from
the
blue
sputter
of
a
city
light
that
snuffs
out
moon
and
stars
for
tired
scurrying
folks
but
the
opalescent
of
the
rainbow
falls
wove
heavens
for
me
in
its
sheen
and
through
its
whirlwind
rifts
and
crystal
flaws
far
reaches
opened
up
with
all
the
heart
desire
at
the
other
end
you
shut
your
eyes
with
that
thunder
in
your
ears
and
that
gusty
mist
on
your
face
and
you
see
it
very
plainly
more
plainly
than
ever
so
many
arc
lights
could
make
you
see
it
the
ultimate
meaning
of
things
to
be
sure
when
you
open
your
eyes
again
it
all
gone
the
rainbows
seem
to
hide
it
again
a
mile
below
we
came
upon
the
crooked
falls
of
twenty
feet
leaving
the
left
bank
and
running
almost
parallel
with
it
for
some
three
hundred
yards
then
turning
and
making
a
horseshoe
and
returning
to
the
right
bank
almost
opposite
the
place
of
first
observation
this
fall
is
nearly
a
mile
in
length
being
an
unbroken
sheet
for
that
distance
this
one
also
does
nothing
at
all
and
in
a
beautifully
irregular
way
somehow
it
made
me
think
of
walt
whitman
but
we
left
it
soon
swinging
out
into
the
open
parched
country
we
knew
all
this
turbulence
to
be
merely
the
river
bow
before
the
great
stunt
as
we
swung
along
kicking
up
the
acrid
alkali
dust
from
the
that
snaked
its
way
through
the
cactus
and
sagebrush
the
roar
behind
us
died
and
before
us
far
away
dull
muffled
thunders
grew
up
in
the
hush
of
the
burning
noon
thunders
in
a
desert
and
no
cloud
for
an
hour
we
swung
along
the
trail
and
ever
the
thunders
increased
like
the
undertone
of
the
surf
when
the
sea
whitens
we
were
approaching
the
great
falls
of
the
missouri
there
were
no
sign
posts
in
that
lonesome
tract
no
one
of
whom
to
ask
the
way
little
did
we
need
direction
the
voice
of
thunder
crying
in
the
desert
led
us
surely
a
more
of
clambering
over
gullies
up
watercourses
and
we
found
ourselves
toiling
up
the
ragged
slope
of
a
bluff
and
soon
we
stood
upon
a
rocky
ledge
with
the
thunders
beneath
us
damp
gusts
beat
upward
over
the
blistering
scarp
of
the
cliff
i
lay
down
and
crawling
to
the
edge
looked
over
two
hundred
feet
below
me
straight
down
as
a
pebble
drops
a
watery
inferno
raged
and
whirlwinds
all
but
exhausted
with
the
dizzy
upward
reach
whisked
cool
invisible
mops
of
mist
across
my
face
flung
down
a
preliminary
mile
of
steep
descent
choked
in
between
soaring
walls
of
rock
four
hundred
yards
apart
innumerable
crystal
tons
rushed
down
ninety
feet
in
one
magnificent
plunge
you
saw
the
long
bent
crest
shimmering
with
the
changing
colors
of
a
peacock
back
smooth
as
a
lake
when
all
winds
sleep
and
then
the
mighty
river
was
snuffed
out
in
gulfs
of
angry
gray
capricious
river
draughts
sucking
up
the
damp
defile
whipped
upward
into
the
blistering
sunlight
gray
spiral
towers
that
leaped
into
opal
fires
and
dissolved
in
showers
of
diamond
and
pearl
and
amethyst
illustration
great
falls
from
cliff
above
illustration
great
falls
from
the
front
i
caught
myself
tightly
gripping
the
ledge
and
shrinking
with
a
shuddering
instinctive
fear
then
suddenly
the
thunders
seemed
to
stifle
all
memory
of
sound
and
left
only
the
silent
universe
with
myself
and
this
terribly
beautiful
thing
in
the
midst
of
utter
emptiness
and
i
loved
it
with
a
strange
desperate
tigerish
love
it
expressed
itself
so
magnificently
and
that
is
really
all
a
man
or
a
waterfall
or
a
mountain
or
a
flower
or
a
grasshopper
or
a
meadow
lark
or
an
ocean
or
a
thunderstorm
has
to
do
in
this
world
and
it
was
doing
it
right
out
in
the
middle
of
a
desert
bleak
forbidding
with
only
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
the
sun
and
a
or
two
to
behold
thundering
out
its
message
into
the
waste
places
careless
of
audiences
like
a
master
bully
grizzled
old
singing
as
most
of
them
do
to
empty
benches
and
it
had
been
doing
that
ten
thousand
thousand
years
and
would
do
so
for
ten
thousand
thousand
more
and
never
pause
for
plaudits
i
suspect
the
soul
of
old
homer
did
that
and
is
still
doing
it
somehow
somewhere
after
all
there
much
difference
between
really
tremendous
things
homer
or
waterfalls
or
thunderstorms
is
there
it
only
a
matter
of
how
things
happen
to
be
big
i
was
chasing
some
big
thundering
line
of
sophocles
when
bill
the
little
cornishman
ran
in
between
me
and
the
evasive
line
lord
what
a
waste
of
power
there
is
some
difference
in
temperaments
most
men
i
fancy
would
have
enjoyed
a
talk
with
a
civil
engineer
upon
that
ledge
i
should
have
liked
to
have
shelley
there
myself
it
the
difference
between
poetry
and
dithyrambics
and
dynamos
keats
and
kipling
what
is
the
energy
exerted
by
the
great
falls
of
the
missouri
how
many
did
shelley
fling
into
the
creation
of
his
how
many
did
the
boy
heart
of
chatterton
beat
before
it
broke
something
may
be
left
to
the
imagination
we
backtrailed
to
a
point
where
the
cliff
fell
away
into
a
incline
and
clambered
down
a
slope
to
the
edge
of
the
crystal
broil
there
was
a
strange
exhilaration
about
it
a
novel
sense
of
discovering
a
natural
wonder
for
ourselves
we
seemed
the
first
men
who
had
ever
been
there
that
was
the
most
gripping
thing
about
it
aloof
stupendous
terriffic
staggering
in
the
intensity
of
its
wild
beauty
you
reach
it
by
a
trail
there
are
no
running
and
you
ca
buy
a
sandwich
or
a
peanut
or
a
glass
of
beer
within
ten
miles
of
its
thunders
for
twentieth
century
america
that
is
doing
rather
well
skirting
the
slippery
rocks
at
the
lip
of
the
mad
flood
we
swung
ourselves
about
a
ledge
dripping
with
the
cool
descended
to
the
level
of
the
lower
basin
where
a
soaking
fog
made
us
shiver
pushed
through
a
dripping
oozing
autumnal
sort
of
twilight
and
came
out
again
into
the
beat
of
the
desert
sun
to
look
squarely
into
the
face
of
the
giant
a
hawk
wheeled
and
swooped
and
floated
far
up
in
the
dazzling
air
somehow
that
hawk
seemed
to
make
the
lonely
place
doubly
lonely
did
you
ever
notice
how
a
lone
coyote
on
a
prairie
gives
you
a
heartache
whereas
the
empty
waste
would
only
have
exhilarated
you
always
it
seemed
that
veering
hawk
had
hung
there
and
would
hang
so
always
outliving
the
rising
of
suns
and
the
drifting
of
stars
and
the
visits
of
the
moon
a
vague
sense
of
grief
came
over
me
at
the
thought
of
all
this
eternal
restlessness
this
turbulent
fixity
and
after
all
it
seemed
much
greater
to
be
even
a
very
little
man
living
largely
dying
somehow
into
something
big
and
new
than
to
be
this
promethean
sort
of
thing
a
giant
waterfall
in
a
waste
i
have
known
men
who
felt
dwarfed
in
the
presence
of
vast
and
awful
things
i
never
felt
bigger
than
when
i
first
looked
upon
the
ocean
the
skyward
lift
of
a
mountain
peak
makes
me
feel
very
very
tall
and
when
a
thunderstorm
comes
down
upon
the
world
out
of
the
northwest
with
jagged
blades
of
fire
ripping
up
the
black
bellies
of
the
clouds
i
know
all
about
the
heart
of
attila
and
the
vikings
and
tigers
and
alexander
the
great
so
i
think
i
grew
a
bit
out
there
talking
to
that
who
does
nothing
at
all
not
even
a
vaudeville
stunt
and
does
it
so
masterfully
by
and
by
they
build
a
hotel
in
the
flat
at
the
edge
of
the
lower
basin
plant
prim
flowers
in
very
prim
beds
and
rob
you
on
the
genteel
european
plan
comfortably
sitting
in
a
willow
chair
on
the
broad
veranda
one
will
read
the
signs
on
those
cliffs
all
about
the
best
shoes
to
wear
and
what
particular
pill
of
all
the
pills
that
be
should
be
taken
for
that
ailing
kidney
but
it
will
not
be
i
who
shall
sit
in
that
willow
chair
on
that
broad
as
yet
unbuilt
veranda
the
sun
was
glinting
at
the
rim
of
the
cliffs
and
the
place
of
awe
and
thunders
was
slowly
filling
with
shadow
we
found
a
steep
trail
inaccessible
for
vehicles
leading
upward
in
the
direction
of
benton
it
was
getting
that
time
of
day
when
even
a
sentimentalist
wants
a
beefsteak
especially
if
he
has
hiked
over
dusty
scorching
trails
and
scrambled
over
rocks
all
day
some
kind
man
back
in
the
town
with
a
fund
of
that
most
useless
article
information
had
told
us
of
a
place
called
goodale
theoretically
existing
on
the
great
northern
railroad
between
great
falls
and
benton
we
had
provided
only
for
luncheon
trusting
to
fate
and
goodale
for
supper
goodale
a
truly
beautiful
name
no
doubt
in
some
miraculous
way
the
character
of
the
country
changed
suddenly
just
before
you
got
there
merely
to
justify
the
name
surely
no
one
would
have
the
temerity
to
conjure
up
so
beautiful
a
name
for
a
desert
town
yet
half
unwillingly
i
thought
of
a
little
place
i
once
visited
against
my
will
since
the
brakeman
put
me
off
there
by
the
name
of
forest
city
i
remembered
with
misgivings
how
there
was
a
tree
within
something
like
four
hundred
miles
but
i
pushed
that
memory
aside
as
a
lying
prophet
i
believed
in
goodale
and
beefsteak
goodale
would
be
a
neat
quiet
little
town
set
snugly
in
a
verdant
valley
we
would
come
into
it
by
starlight
down
a
careless
gypsying
sort
of
country
road
and
there
would
be
the
sound
of
a
dear
little
trickling
bickering
cool
stream
out
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
fringing
the
approach
to
goodale
and
we
pass
pretty
little
cottages
with
vines
growing
over
the
doors
and
hollyhocks
peeping
over
the
fences
and
cheerful
lights
in
the
windows
goodale
and
then
right
in
the
middle
of
the
town
no
the
word
is
cosier
somehow
right
in
the
middle
of
the
village
there
would
be
a
big
restaurant
with
such
alluring
scents
of
beefsteak
all
about
it
i
set
the
pace
up
that
trail
it
was
a
swinging
loose
sort
of
pace
the
kind
that
rubs
the
blue
off
the
distance
and
paints
the
back
trail
gray
goodale
was
a
sort
of
mecca
i
thought
of
it
with
something
like
a
religious
awe
how
far
was
goodale
would
you
suppose
not
far
certainly
once
we
found
the
railroad
we
made
the
last
steep
climb
breathlessly
and
came
out
on
the
level
a
great
monotonous
heartachy
prairie
lay
before
us
utterly
featureless
in
the
twilight
far
off
across
the
scabby
land
a
thin
black
line
swept
out
of
the
dusk
into
the
dusk
straight
as
a
crow
flight
it
was
the
railroad
we
made
a
for
it
tumbling
over
gopher
holes
plunging
through
sagebrush
scrambling
over
gullies
that
told
the
incredible
tale
of
torrents
having
been
there
once
i
ate
quantities
of
alkali
dust
and
went
on
believing
in
goodale
and
beefsteak
beefsteak
became
one
of
the
principal
stations
on
the
great
northern
railroad
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
personally
that
is
what
you
might
call
the
geography
of
a
healthy
stomach
with
the
falling
of
the
sun
the
climate
of
the
country
had
changed
it
was
no
longer
blistering
you
sat
down
for
a
moment
and
a
shiver
went
up
your
spine
at
noon
i
thought
about
all
the
i
had
ever
met
now
i
could
hear
the
hickory
nuts
dropping
in
the
crisp
silence
down
in
the
old
missouri
woods
we
struck
the
railroad
and
went
faster
since
my
first
experience
with
railroad
ties
i
have
continued
to
associate
them
with
hunger
i
need
only
look
an
ordinary
railroad
tie
in
the
face
to
contract
a
wonderful
appetite
it
works
on
the
principle
of
a
memory
system
so
as
we
put
the
ties
behind
us
i
increased
my
order
at
that
restaurant
in
the
sweet
little
pedestrian
village
of
goodale
a
couple
of
eggs
on
the
side
waiter
i
said
half
audibly
to
the
petite
woman
in
the
white
apron
who
served
the
tables
in
the
restaurant
there
she
was
very
real
to
me
i
could
count
the
rings
on
her
fingers
and
when
she
smiled
i
noted
that
her
teeth
were
very
white
doubtless
they
got
that
way
from
eating
quantities
and
quantities
of
thick
juicy
beefsteak
the
track
took
a
sudden
turn
ahead
around
that
bend
i
said
aloud
lies
goodale
we
went
faster
we
rounded
the
bend
only
to
see
the
dusky
heartachy
barren
stretch
railroads
explained
i
to
myself
have
a
way
of
going
somewhere
it
is
one
of
their
peculiarities
no
doubt
this
track
had
been
laid
for
the
express
purpose
of
guiding
hungry
folks
to
the
hospitable
little
village
we
plunged
on
for
an
hour
meanwhile
my
orders
to
the
trim
little
woman
in
the
white
apron
increased
steadily
she
smiled
broadly
but
winsomely
showing
those
charming
teeth
they
shone
like
a
beacon
ahead
of
me
for
it
was
now
dark
suddenly
we
came
upon
a
signboard
we
went
up
to
it
struck
a
match
and
read
breathlessly
goodale
we
looked
about
us
goodale
was
a
switch
and
a
box
car
nothing
beside
remains
i
quoted
the
decay
of
that
colossal
wreck
boundless
and
bare
the
lone
and
level
sands
stretch
far
away
alas
for
the
trim
little
lady
with
the
white
teeth
and
the
smile
and
the
beefsteak
we
said
bitter
things
there
in
that
waste
about
the
man
with
the
information
we
loaded
his
memory
with
anathemas
one
can
not
eat
a
signboard
even
with
so
inviting
a
name
upon
it
an
idea
struck
me
it
seemed
a
very
brilliant
one
at
the
moment
i
sat
down
and
delivered
myself
of
it
to
my
companions
who
also
had
lusted
after
the
we
have
wronged
that
man
with
the
information
said
i
he
was
no
ordinary
individual
he
was
a
prophet
he
simply
got
his
dates
mixed
in
precisely
one
hundred
years
from
now
there
will
be
a
town
on
this
spot
and
a
restaurant
shall
we
wait
they
cursed
me
bitterly
i
suspect
neither
of
them
is
a
philosopher
thereat
i
proceeded
to
eat
a
thick
juicy
steak
from
the
portion
of
an
unborn
steer
served
by
the
trim
little
lady
of
a
hundred
years
hence
there
in
that
potential
village
of
goodale
and
as
i
smoked
my
cigarette
i
felt
very
thankful
for
all
the
beautiful
things
that
do
not
exist
and
i
slept
that
night
in
the
great
front
bedroom
the
ceiling
of
which
is
of
diamond
and
turquoise
chapter
iii
to
the
moon
at
last
the
sinuous
yellow
road
dropped
over
the
bluff
rim
and
to
all
appearances
dissolved
into
the
sky
a
sky
it
was
sundown
and
this
was
the
end
of
the
trail
for
us
beneath
the
bluff
rim
lay
benton
we
flung
ourselves
down
in
the
that
whispered
dryly
in
a
cool
wind
fresh
from
the
creeping
now
that
benton
lay
beneath
us
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
look
upon
it
benton
what
a
clarion
cry
that
name
had
been
to
me
old
men
too
old
for
voyages
had
talked
about
this
place
a
long
time
ago
down
on
the
kansas
city
docks
i
had
heard
them
how
far
away
it
was
then
reach
after
reach
bend
after
bend
grunting
snoring
toiling
sparring
over
bars
bucking
the
currents
dodging
the
snags
went
the
steamers
brave
little
steamers
forging
on
toward
fort
benton
and
it
was
so
very
very
far
away
to
the
moon
no
doubt
louis
was
indeed
very
far
away
but
fort
benton
well
they
spoke
of
the
fort
benton
traffic
as
the
mountain
trade
and
i
had
not
then
seen
a
mountain
you
could
stand
on
the
very
tallest
building
in
kansas
city
and
you
could
look
and
look
and
never
see
a
mountain
and
to
think
how
far
the
brave
little
steamers
had
to
go
how
they
ever
manage
to
get
back
but
the
old
men
on
the
docks
they
had
been
there
and
all
the
way
back
perhaps
hundreds
of
times
and
they
were
such
heroes
great
hands
they
had
toughened
with
the
gripping
of
cables
eyes
that
had
that
way
of
looking
through
and
far
beyond
things
seamen
and
plainsmen
have
it
and
they
had
such
romantic
crinkly
wrinkly
leathery
faces
they
got
so
on
the
way
to
benton
and
back
and
they
talked
about
it
those
old
men
lounging
on
the
docks
because
it
was
so
far
away
and
they
were
so
old
that
they
could
get
there
any
more
what
a
picture
i
made
out
of
their
kaleidoscopic
chatter
beautifully
inaccurate
impossibly
romantic
picture
in
which
big
muscley
men
had
fights
with
yawping
painted
savages
that
always
got
gloriously
licked
in
the
approved
manner
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
see
it
all
very
plainly
away
off
there
to
the
moon
and
i
used
to
wonder
how
my
father
could
be
such
a
strong
man
and
never
have
any
hankering
to
go
up
there
at
all
the
two
facts
were
quite
incompatible
he
should
have
been
a
captain
and
taken
me
on
for
cub
pilot
or
at
least
a
striker
engineer
though
i
would
have
objected
seriously
to
the
business
of
a
cabin
boy
i
thought
it
would
be
very
nice
to
engage
in
the
mountain
trade
and
then
after
a
while
in
the
new
light
that
creeps
in
with
years
i
began
to
rearrange
my
picture
of
things
up
there
and
benton
crept
a
wee
bit
closer
until
i
could
see
its
four
adobe
walls
and
its
two
adobe
bastions
stern
with
portholes
sitting
like
bulldogs
at
the
opposite
corners
ready
to
bark
at
intruders
and
in
and
out
at
the
big
gate
went
the
trappers
sturdy
hirsute
fellows
in
buckskins
with
northwest
fusils
on
their
shoulders
capable
fellows
with
souls
as
lean
as
their
bodies
survivors
of
long
hard
trails
men
who
could
go
far
and
eat
little
and
never
give
up
i
was
very
fond
of
that
sort
of
man
little
by
little
the
picture
grew
indian
bull
boats
flocked
at
the
river
front
beneath
the
stern
adobe
walls
moored
mackinaws
swayed
in
the
current
waiting
to
be
loaded
with
peltries
and
loosed
for
the
long
drift
back
to
the
states
and
the
looking
very
fat
and
lazy
unloaded
supplies
in
the
late
fall
that
were
loaded
at
louis
in
the
early
spring
and
these
had
come
all
the
way
without
the
stroke
of
a
piston
or
the
crunch
of
a
or
a
pound
of
steam
nothing
but
grit
and
to
drag
them
a
small
matter
of
two
or
three
thousand
miles
up
the
current
of
the
most
eccentric
old
duffer
of
a
river
in
the
world
what
men
it
did
take
to
do
that
i
saw
them
on
the
wild
shelterless
banks
of
the
yellow
flood
a
score
or
so
of
them
stripped
and
sweating
under
the
prairie
sun
with
the
cordelle
on
their
calloused
shoulders
straightening
out
to
the
work
like
honest
oxen
what
those
cordelle
men
were
what
fed
on
wild
red
meat
lean
and
round
of
waist
thick
of
chest
thewed
for
going
on
to
the
finish
ten
or
fifteen
miles
a
day
and
every
inch
a
fight
be
sure
they
did
do
it
merely
for
the
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
they
got
from
the
company
they
did
it
because
they
were
that
sort
of
men
and
had
to
express
themselves
everything
worth
while
is
done
that
way
do
they
raise
that
breed
now
never
doubt
it
you
need
only
find
your
or
their
equivalents
and
the
men
will
come
around
for
the
job
i
sure
but
when
you
speak
enthusiastically
of
the
old
greek
doers
of
things
i
like
to
put
in
a
few
words
for
those
old
men
they
belong
to
the
unwritten
american
epic
and
then
the
and
the
and
the
mackinaws
and
the
men
flashed
out
like
a
stereopticon
picture
when
the
man
moves
the
slide
and
i
saw
a
little
ragged
village
of
log
houses
scattered
along
the
water
front
i
saw
the
levees
piled
with
merchandise
and
a
score
or
more
of
packets
rushing
fresh
cargoes
ashore
mates
bawling
commands
down
the
gangplanks
where
the
roustabouts
came
and
went
at
a
trot
hundreds
thronged
the
streets
of
this
raw
little
village
the
commercial
center
of
a
vast
new
empire
freighters
trundled
away
toward
the
gold
fields
and
others
trundled
in
their
horses
jaded
with
the
precious
freight
they
pulled
and
i
saw
steamers
dropping
out
for
the
long
voyage
back
to
the
states
freighted
with
cargoes
of
gold
dust
really
truly
that
would
have
made
old
captain
kidd
men
mad
with
delight
as
i
lay
dreaming
in
the
it
all
grew
up
so
real
that
i
had
to
get
up
and
take
my
first
look
half
expecting
to
find
it
all
there
just
as
in
the
old
days
we
stood
at
the
rim
of
the
bluff
and
looked
down
into
a
valley
upon
a
quiet
little
village
winking
with
scattered
lights
in
the
gloaming
past
it
swept
the
river
glazed
with
the
twilight
and
with
early
stars
this
was
benton
it
could
have
been
almost
any
other
town
as
well
and
yet
once
upon
a
time
it
had
filled
my
with
wonders
this
place
that
seemed
to
the
moon
the
shrill
shriek
of
a
great
northern
locomotive
trundling
freight
cars
through
the
gloom
gave
the
to
the
old
it
was
the
cry
of
modernity
this
boisterous
bustling
thing
plunging
through
the
night
with
flame
in
its
throat
had
made
the
change
dragged
old
benton
out
of
the
lunar
regions
and
set
what
is
left
of
it
right
down
in
the
back
yard
of
the
world
even
a
very
little
boy
could
get
there
now
and
yet
thought
i
as
we
set
out
rapidly
for
the
village
in
the
valley
the
difference
between
the
poetry
of
mackinaws
and
great
northern
locomotives
is
merely
a
matter
of
perspective
if
those
old
cordelle
men
could
only
come
back
for
a
while
from
their
walhalla
how
they
would
crowd
about
that
iron
beast
panting
from
its
long
run
and
catching
its
breath
for
another
plunge
into
the
waste
places
and
the
night
and
i
i
would
be
gazing
at
the
cordelle
men
it
only
the
human
curiosity
about
the
other
side
of
the
moon
how
perfect
the
nights
would
be
if
we
could
only
see
that
lost
pleiad
in
the
powdery
sand
we
entered
the
little
town
with
its
business
row
facing
the
water
front
one
glance
at
the
empty
levees
told
you
of
the
town
dead
glory
not
a
steamboat
stacks
blackening
in
the
gloom
broke
the
peaceful
glitter
of
the
river
under
the
stars
but
along
the
sidewalk
where
the
buzzed
and
hummed
brawny
booted
and
spurred
lounged
about
talking
in
that
odd
but
not
unpleasant
western
english
that
could
almost
be
called
a
dialect
but
it
was
not
the
benton
of
the
that
i
felt
about
me
it
was
still
for
me
the
benton
of
the
fur
trade
and
the
steamboats
and
the
gold
rush
my
boyhood
benton
to
the
moon
the
ghost
of
a
dead
town
at
goodale
i
had
sought
a
substantial
town
and
found
a
visionary
one
at
benton
i
had
sought
a
visionary
town
and
found
a
substantial
one
philosophy
was
plainly
indicated
as
the
proper
thing
and
after
all
a
steaming
plate
of
lamp
chops
in
a
chinese
of
a
substantial
though
disappointing
town
is
more
acceptable
to
even
a
dreamer
than
the
visionary
beefsteak
i
ate
out
there
in
that
latent
restaurant
of
a
potential
village
this
was
a
comfortable
thought
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
far
weird
cry
of
things
that
are
no
more
was
of
no
avail
the
rapid
music
of
knife
and
fork
drowned
out
the
asthmatic
snoring
of
the
ghostly
packets
that
buck
the
stream
no
more
how
grub
does
win
against
sentiment
swallowing
the
last
of
the
chops
where
will
i
find
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
i
asked
of
my
neighbor
across
the
wreck
of
supper
he
looked
bored
and
stiffened
a
horny
practical
thumb
in
the
general
direction
of
the
ruins
over
there
he
said
laconically
i
caught
myself
wondering
if
a
modern
athenian
would
thus
carelessly
direct
you
to
the
acropolis
is
the
comparison
faulty
surely
a
ruin
is
sacred
only
for
what
men
did
there
we
are
indeed
a
headlong
race
we
keep
our
ruins
behind
us
perhaps
that
is
why
we
get
somewhere
and
yet
what
beauty
blooms
flowerlike
to
the
backward
gaze
music
and
poetry
all
the
deepest
purest
sentiments
of
the
heart
are
fed
greatly
upon
the
memory
of
the
things
that
were
but
can
never
be
again
mnemosyne
is
the
mother
of
all
the
muses
i
got
up
and
went
out
by
the
light
of
a
thin
moon
i
found
the
place
over
there
an
odd
pathetic
little
ruin
it
is
to
be
sure
nothing
imposing
about
it
it
does
compel
through
admiration
it
woos
through
pity
the
great
impersonal
kind
of
pity
a
single
little
turret
that
remains
on
the
plains
browning
tells
about
all
there
is
to
tell
about
it
though
he
never
heard
of
it
only
they
called
it
a
bastion
in
the
old
days
the
little
square
adobe
blockhouse
that
wo
stand
much
longer
one
crumbling
bastion
and
two
gaunt
fragments
of
adobe
walls
in
a
waste
of
sand
beside
the
river
that
fort
benton
a
thin
pale
grudging
strip
of
moon
lit
it
up
just
the
moon
by
which
to
see
ruins
a
moon
for
backward
looking
and
regrets
a
full
round
would
have
served
at
all
out
of
pure
i
restored
the
walls
of
the
house
where
the
bourgeois
lived
the
fireplace
and
the
great
mud
chimney
are
still
there
and
the
smut
of
the
old
log
fires
still
clings
inside
the
man
who
sat
before
that
hearth
was
an
american
king
a
simple
word
of
command
spoken
in
that
room
was
the
thunder
of
the
law
in
the
wilderness
about
and
men
obeyed
there
a
bat
living
there
now
he
tumbled
about
me
in
the
dull
light
filling
the
silence
with
the
harsh
whir
of
pinions
i
thought
about
that
night
a
long
long
time
ago
when
all
the
people
under
the
protection
of
the
newly
erected
fort
gathered
here
for
a
how
clearly
i
could
hear
that
squawking
squeaking
fiddle
and
the
din
of
dancing
feet
only
the
sound
got
mixed
up
with
the
dim
weird
moonlight
until
you
did
know
whether
you
were
hearing
or
seeing
or
feeling
it
the
music
of
the
fiddles
and
the
feet
oh
the
dim
far
music
i
thought
about
the
other
ruins
of
the
world
the
exploited
ruins
and
i
wondered
why
the
others
attract
so
much
attention
while
this
one
attracts
practically
none
at
all
how
they
do
dig
after
old
troy
poor
old
troy
and
nobody
even
cares
to
steal
a
brick
from
this
ruined
citadel
that
took
so
great
a
part
in
the
american
epic
indeed
you
would
not
be
obliged
to
steal
a
brick
there
are
no
guards
some
one
has
said
that
the
history
of
our
country
as
taught
in
the
common
schools
is
the
history
of
a
narrow
strip
of
land
along
the
atlantic
coast
the
statement
is
significant
the
average
knows
very
little
about
fort
benton
i
suspect
and
yet
one
of
the
most
tremendous
of
all
human
movements
centered
about
it
the
movement
that
brought
about
the
settlement
of
the
northwest
one
of
these
days
they
will
plant
a
potato
patch
there
but
modern
benton
get
on
a
train
in
the
east
snuggle
up
in
your
berth
plunge
on
to
the
western
coast
and
you
run
through
the
real
west
in
the
night
they
are
getting
eastern
out
there
at
the
rim
of
the
big
sea
benton
is
in
the
west
the
big
free
west
and
it
gives
promise
of
staying
there
for
a
while
yet
charter
a
bronco
and
canter
out
across
the
river
for
an
hour
and
it
will
be
very
plain
to
you
that
the
romantic
west
still
lives
the
west
of
the
cowboy
and
the
bronco
and
the
steer
not
the
average
west
to
be
sure
perhaps
that
west
never
existed
but
it
is
the
west
that
has
bred
and
is
still
breeding
a
race
of
men
as
beautiful
in
a
virile
way
and
how
else
should
men
be
beautiful
as
this
dear
old
mother
of
an
earth
ever
suckled
i
stood
once
on
the
yellow
slope
of
a
hill
and
watched
a
outfit
passing
in
the
gulch
below
freighters
grumbling
up
the
dusty
trail
cook
wagons
trundling
after
whips
popping
over
the
sweating
teams
a
hundred
or
more
saddle
ponies
trailing
after
in
rolling
clouds
of
glinting
dust
a
score
of
outriders
mounted
on
gaunt
tough
wise
little
horses
such
strong
outdoor
masterful
americans
truly
beautiful
in
a
big
manly
way
the
sight
of
it
all
put
that
glorious
little
achy
feeling
in
my
throat
that
you
get
when
they
start
the
fife
and
drum
or
when
a
cavalry
column
wheels
at
the
word
of
command
or
when
a
regiment
swings
past
with
even
tread
or
when
you
stand
on
a
dock
and
watch
a
liner
dropping
out
into
the
fog
it
the
feeling
that
you
a
man
and
mighty
proud
of
it
but
somehow
it
always
makes
you
just
a
little
sad
i
felt
proud
of
that
bunch
of
strong
capable
fellows
proud
as
though
i
had
created
them
myself
illustration
this
was
benton
illustration
ruins
of
old
fort
benton
illustration
the
house
of
the
bourgeois
and
once
again
the
glorious
little
achy
feeling
in
the
throat
came
the
congressman
from
choteau
county
had
returned
from
washington
with
fresh
laurels
and
benton
turned
out
to
welcome
her
great
man
down
the
dusty
poorly
lighted
front
street
came
the
little
band
a
squad
halting
under
the
dingy
glow
of
a
corner
they
struck
up
the
noisiest
noise
i
ever
heard
the
tuba
raced
lumberingly
after
the
galloping
cornet
that
ran
with
the
wheezing
clarinet
and
the
drums
beat
up
behind
pounding
like
the
hoofs
of
horses
half
a
stretch
behind
it
was
a
mad
exciting
race
of
sounds
a
sort
of
handicap
the
circular
glow
of
the
became
the
social
center
of
benton
at
last
the
mad
race
was
ended
i
think
it
was
the
cornet
that
won
with
the
clarinet
a
close
second
the
tuba
as
i
recollect
it
complacently
claimed
third
money
and
the
finished
last
with
a
shameless
resolute
boom
a
great
hoarse
cry
went
up
probably
for
the
winning
cornet
a
generous
warrior
cry
that
made
you
think
of
a
cavalry
charge
in
the
face
of
bayonets
and
the
band
swung
off
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
little
cottage
where
the
great
man
lived
all
benton
fell
in
behind
clerks
and
and
sheepmen
and
cowboys
tumbling
into
fours
under
the
yellow
flare
of
the
kerosene
torches
they
went
down
the
street
like
a
campaigning
company
in
rout
step
scattering
din
and
dust
great
open
air
fellows
they
were
big
lovers
big
haters
good
laughers
eaters
drinkers
and
every
one
of
them
potentially
a
fighting
man
and
suddenly
as
i
watched
them
pass
something
deep
down
in
me
cried
out
great
god
what
a
fighting
force
we
can
drum
up
out
of
the
cactus
and
the
sagebrush
when
the
time
comes
and
when
i
looked
again
not
one
of
the
faces
was
strange
to
me
but
every
one
was
the
face
of
a
brother
choteau
congressman
was
my
congressman
benton
great
man
was
my
great
man
i
fell
into
line
alongside
a
big
with
his
boots
and
his
clanking
spurs
and
his
horseman
stride
thirty
yards
farther
on
we
were
old
comrades
that
is
the
western
way
once
again
the
little
band
struck
up
a
march
which
was
very
little
more
than
a
rhythmic
snarling
and
booming
of
the
drums
with
now
and
then
the
shrill
savage
cry
of
the
clarinet
stabbing
the
general
dim
irresistibly
the
whole
line
swung
into
step
what
is
it
about
the
rhythmic
stride
of
many
men
down
a
dusty
road
that
grips
you
by
the
throat
and
makes
your
lungs
feel
like
overcharged
balloons
i
felt
something
like
the
maddening
irritating
tang
of
in
my
throat
trumpet
cries
that
i
had
never
heard
yet
somehow
dimly
remembered
wakened
in
the
night
about
us
far
and
faint
but
haughty
with
command
it
took
very
little
imagination
for
me
to
feel
the
whirlwind
of
battles
i
may
never
know
to
hear
the
harsh
metallic
snarl
of
bullets
i
may
never
face
for
marching
there
in
the
dusty
night
with
that
ragged
procession
of
westerners
a
deep
sense
of
the
essential
comradeship
of
free
men
had
come
upon
me
and
i
could
think
of
these
men
in
no
other
way
than
as
potential
fighting
men
the
stern
hard
stuff
with
which
you
build
and
keep
your
empires
what
a
row
napoleon
could
have
kicked
up
with
half
a
million
of
these
sagebrush
boys
to
fling
foeward
under
his
we
reached
the
cottage
of
the
great
man
with
the
fresh
laurels
he
met
us
at
the
gate
he
called
us
jim
and
bill
and
frank
and
kid
something
or
other
we
called
him
charlie
and
he
was
the
least
bit
stiff
or
proud
though
we
had
the
least
doubt
that
half
of
washington
was
in
tears
at
his
departure
for
the
west
the
sudden
flare
of
a
torch
betrayed
his
moist
eyes
as
he
told
us
how
he
loved
us
and
i
sure
he
meant
it
he
said
with
that
western
drawl
of
his
boys
while
i
was
back
there
trying
to
do
a
little
something
for
you
in
congress
i
heard
a
lot
of
swell
bands
but
i
did
hear
any
such
music
as
this
little
old
band
of
ours
has
made
the
unintentional
humor
somehow
did
make
you
want
to
laugh
at
all
we
all
riding
with
his
outfit
and
next
year
we
going
to
send
charlie
back
east
again
may
we
all
die
sheepmen
if
we
do
and
the
limit
in
montana
talking
about
sheepmen
reminds
me
of
joe
the
big
and
his
i
was
doing
the
town
with
joe
and
he
was
carefully
educating
me
in
the
western
mysteries
he
told
me
all
about
and
and
and
showed
me
how
to
tie
a
and
a
and
a
mexican
hacamore
put
me
onto
the
and
the
quick
that
puts
a
steer
legs
showed
me
how
a
cowboy
makes
dance
music
with
a
broom
and
a
and
many
other
wonderful
feats
none
of
which
i
can
myself
perform
i
wanted
to
feel
the
mettle
of
the
big
typical
fellow
and
so
i
said
playfully
say
joe
come
to
confession
you
a
sheepman
now
you
he
clanked
down
a
glass
of
liquid
and
glared
down
at
me
with
a
monitory
forefinger
pointing
straight
between
my
eyes
now
you
look
here
shorty
he
drawled
you
a
friend
of
mine
and
whatever
you
say
as
long
as
i
ai
all
caved
in
but
you
cut
that
out
and
do
you
say
that
out
loud
again
or
you
and
me
be
having
to
scrap
the
whole
outfit
he
resumed
his
glass
i
told
him
still
playfully
that
a
lot
of
mighty
good
poetry
had
been
written
about
sheep
and
sheepmen
and
crooks
and
lambs
and
things
like
that
and
that
i
considered
my
question
complimentary
you
talkin
about
sheepmen
in
the
old
country
shorty
he
drawled
there
ai
any
cattle
ranges
there
you
know
do
you
know
the
difference
between
a
sheepman
in
scotland
say
and
in
montana
i
did
not
well
he
proceeded
over
in
scotland
when
a
feller
sees
a
sheepman
coming
down
the
road
with
his
sheep
he
says
the
gentle
shepherd
with
his
fleecy
flock
that
poetry
now
in
montana
that
same
feller
says
when
he
sees
the
same
feller
coming
over
a
ridge
with
the
same
sheep
at
that
crazy
with
his
woolies
that
fact
you
mind
what
i
say
or
you
get
spurred
i
do
quite
agree
with
joe
however
once
lying
in
my
tent
across
the
river
i
looked
out
over
the
breaks
through
that
strange
purple
moonlight
such
as
i
had
always
believed
to
exist
only
in
the
staging
of
a
melodrama
and
saw
four
thousand
sheep
descending
to
the
ferry
like
lava
from
a
crater
they
poured
over
the
slope
above
me
and
above
them
seeming
prodigiously
big
against
the
weird
sky
went
the
sheepman
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
a
over
his
arm
while
at
his
heels
a
wise
collie
followed
it
was
a
picture
done
by
chance
very
much
as
millet
could
have
done
it
and
somehow
joe
could
stand
before
that
picture
there
is
indeed
a
big
pindaric
sort
of
poetry
about
a
plunging
mass
of
cattle
and
just
as
truly
there
is
a
sort
of
theocritus
poetry
about
sheep
only
in
the
latter
case
the
poetical
vanishing
point
is
farther
away
for
me
than
is
the
case
with
cattle
i
think
i
could
write
very
good
verses
about
a
flock
of
sheep
unless
i
were
at
least
five
hundred
yards
away
from
them
i
have
figured
the
exact
distance
as
yet
but
when
you
have
a
large
flock
of
sheep
camping
about
you
all
night
making
you
eat
fine
sand
and
driving
you
mad
with
that
most
idiotic
of
all
noises
which
happened
once
to
me
you
do
get
up
in
the
morning
quoting
theocritus
you
remember
joe
we
found
a
convenient
gravel
bar
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
where
we
established
our
there
we
proceeded
to
set
up
the
keel
of
the
a
canoe
with
beam
lightly
ribbed
with
oak
and
planked
with
cypress
no
sooner
had
we
screwed
up
the
bolts
in
the
keel
than
our
became
a
sort
of
free
information
bureau
every
evening
the
cable
ferry
brought
over
a
contingent
of
who
were
ardent
in
their
desire
to
encourage
us
in
our
undertaking
which
was
no
less
than
that
of
making
a
toboggan
slide
down
the
roof
of
the
continent
the
salient
weakness
of
the
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
is
an
overwhelming
desire
to
give
advice
through
several
weeks
of
toil
we
were
treated
to
a
most
liberal
education
on
marine
matters
it
appeared
that
we
had
been
laboring
under
a
fatal
misunderstanding
regarding
the
general
subject
of
navigation
our
style
of
boat
was
indeed
admirable
for
a
lake
if
you
please
well
of
course
they
did
not
wish
to
discourage
us
it
was
quite
possible
that
we
were
unacquainted
with
the
upper
missouri
now
the
upper
river
hanging
out
that
bleached
rag
of
a
sympathetic
smile
the
upper
river
was
the
lower
river
you
know
that
really
seem
remarkably
true
and
we
became
alarmed
the
upper
river
mind
you
was
terriffic
why
those
frail
ribs
and
that
impossible
planking
would
go
to
pieces
on
the
first
rock
like
an
egshell
of
course
we
were
free
to
do
as
we
pleased
they
would
not
discourage
us
for
the
world
and
the
engine
gracious
such
a
boat
would
never
stand
the
vibration
of
a
engine
driving
a
screw
it
appeared
plainly
that
we
were
almost
criminally
wrong
in
all
our
calculations
shamefacedly
we
continued
to
drive
nails
into
the
impossible
hull
knowing
full
well
poor
misguided
heroes
that
we
were
only
fashioning
a
death
trap
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
free
information
bureau
was
unanimous
it
was
all
very
pathetic
nothing
but
the
tonic
of
an
habitual
morning
swim
in
the
clear
cold
river
kept
us
game
in
the
face
of
the
inevitable
we
saw
it
all
with
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
we
pushed
on
with
the
fatal
work
never
before
did
i
appreciate
old
job
in
the
clutches
of
good
advice
i
used
to
accuse
him
of
rabbit
blood
in
the
light
of
experience
i
wish
to
record
the
fact
that
i
beg
his
pardon
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
friends
i
think
job
and
i
understand
each
other
better
now
it
was
not
the
boils
but
the
free
advice
at
last
the
final
nail
was
driven
and
clenched
the
canvas
glued
on
and
ironed
the
engine
installed
the
trim
slim
little
craft
with
her
admirable
speed
lines
tapering
fore
and
aft
like
a
fish
lay
on
the
ways
ready
for
the
plunge
we
had
arranged
to
christen
her
with
beer
the
kid
stood
at
the
prow
with
the
bottle
poised
awaiting
his
cue
the
little
cornishman
knelt
at
the
prow
he
was
bowed
in
prayer
he
was
holding
a
bucket
under
the
bottle
for
said
he
in
a
country
where
beer
is
so
dear
and
advice
so
cheap
let
us
save
the
beer
that
we
may
be
strong
to
stand
the
advice
the
argument
was
inded
socratic
and
now
little
boat
said
i
in
that
dark
brown
tone
of
voice
of
which
i
am
particularly
proud
be
a
good
girl
deliver
me
not
unto
the
laughter
of
my
good
advisers
i
christen
thee
the
bottle
broke
directly
above
that
bucket
and
now
before
us
lay
the
impossible
as
plainly
pointed
out
not
only
by
local
talent
but
by
no
less
a
man
that
the
august
captain
of
a
government
several
weeks
before
the
launching
an
event
had
taken
place
at
benton
the
first
steamboat
for
sixteen
years
tied
up
there
one
evening
she
was
a
government
now
a
government
may
be
defined
as
a
boat
maintained
by
the
government
for
the
sole
purpose
of
sailing
the
river
dodging
this
particular
i
learned
afterward
in
the
course
of
a
long
cruise
behind
her
holds
the
record
i
consider
her
pilot
a
truly
remarkable
man
he
seemed
to
have
dodged
them
all
all
benton
turned
out
to
view
the
big
red
and
white
government
steamer
there
was
something
almost
pathetic
about
the
public
demonstration
when
you
thought
of
the
good
old
steamboat
days
during
her
one
day
visit
to
the
town
i
met
the
captain
illustration
a
outfit
on
the
march
illustration
joe
illustration
montana
sheep
illustration
a
montana
he
was
very
stiff
and
proud
he
awed
me
i
stood
before
him
fumbling
my
hat
said
i
to
myself
the
personage
before
me
is
more
than
a
captain
this
is
none
other
than
the
gentleman
who
invented
the
missouri
river
no
doubt
even
now
he
carries
the
patent
in
his
pocket
going
down
river
in
a
power
canoe
eh
he
growled
regarding
me
critically
well
you
never
get
down
that
so
croaked
i
endeavoring
to
swallow
my
adam
apple
no
you
wo
why
ventured
i
timidly
almost
pleadingly
is
there
uh
there
uh
water
enough
yes
growled
the
personage
who
invented
the
longest
river
in
the
world
and
therefore
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
plenty
of
water
you
wo
find
now
as
the
slid
into
the
stream
i
thought
of
the
words
since
that
time
the
river
had
fallen
three
feet
we
drew
eighteen
inches
days
after
that
oraculous
utterance
of
the
captain
the
kid
and
i
half
stripped
sweating
at
the
oars
were
forging
slowly
against
a
head
wind
at
the
mouth
of
the
cheyenne
sixteen
hundred
miles
below
the
head
of
navigation
a
big
white
and
red
steamer
was
creeping
up
stream
over
the
shallow
crossing
of
the
cheyenne
bar
sounding
every
foot
of
the
water
fallen
far
below
the
usual
summer
level
it
was
the
crossing
her
bows
and
drifting
past
her
slowly
i
stood
up
and
shouted
to
the
party
in
the
pilot
house
i
want
to
speak
to
the
captain
he
came
out
on
the
hurricane
deck
the
man
who
invented
the
river
he
was
still
stiff
and
proud
but
a
swift
smile
crossed
his
face
as
he
looked
down
upon
us
and
there
in
our
dinky
little
craft
captain
i
cried
and
perhaps
there
was
the
least
vainglory
in
me
i
talked
to
you
at
benton
yes
sir
well
have
found
that
water
chapter
iv
making
a
getaway
tell
a
teuton
that
he
ca
and
very
likely
he
will
show
you
that
he
can
it
in
the
blood
between
the
prophecy
of
the
captain
and
my
vainglorious
answer
at
the
cheyenne
crossing
i
learned
to
respect
the
words
of
the
man
who
invented
the
eccentric
old
river
in
the
face
of
heavy
head
winds
i
quoted
the
words
you
never
get
down
and
they
bit
deep
like
whip
lashes
on
many
a
and
gravel
reef
with
the
channel
far
away
i
heard
the
words
plenty
of
water
yes
but
you
wo
find
it
and
always
something
stronger
than
my
muscles
cried
out
within
me
the
devil
i
wo
o
you
inventor
of
creeks
hour
by
hour
day
by
day
against
almost
continual
head
winds
and
with
the
lowest
water
in
years
that
discouraging
prophecy
invaded
me
and
was
repulsed
and
that
is
why
we
have
pessimists
in
the
world
a
pessimist
is
merely
a
i
stood
on
the
bank
for
some
time
after
the
slid
into
the
water
admiring
her
truly
beautiful
lines
once
i
was
captain
of
a
trunk
lid
that
sailed
a
down
in
kansas
city
and
at
that
time
i
thought
i
knew
the
meaning
of
pride
i
did
not
all
three
of
us
were
a
bit
puffed
up
over
that
boat
something
of
that
ride
that
goes
before
a
fall
awoke
in
my
captain
breast
as
i
loved
her
with
my
eyes
that
trim
slim
tugging
at
her
forward
line
graceful
and
slender
and
strong
and
fleet
as
a
diana
i
said
at
last
i
will
now
get
in
her
drop
down
to
the
town
landing
and
proceed
to
put
to
shame
a
few
of
these
local
that
make
so
much
fuss
and
do
go
anywhere
i
loved
her
as
a
man
should
love
all
things
that
are
swift
and
strong
and
honest
keen
for
marks
and
goals
a
big
thoroughbred
horse
that
will
break
his
heart
to
get
under
the
wire
first
a
rifle
slim
of
muzzle
thick
of
breech
with
its
wicked
little
throaty
cry
doing
its
business
over
a
flat
trajectory
a
thousand
yards
away
i
love
her
as
a
man
should
love
those
little
did
i
dream
that
she
would
betray
me
i
took
in
the
line
and
went
aboard
at
that
moment
i
almost
understood
the
captain
bearing
to
be
master
of
the
seemed
quite
enough
but
to
be
the
really
truly
captain
of
a
big
red
and
white
it
must
have
been
overwhelming
i
dropped
out
into
the
current
that
fresh
from
its
plunge
of
four
hundred
feet
in
sixteen
miles
ran
briskly
everything
was
in
readiness
i
meant
to
put
a
crimp
in
the
vanity
of
that
bureau
i
turned
on
the
switch
opened
the
needle
valve
swung
the
throttle
over
to
the
notch
numbered
with
a
big
i
placed
the
crank
on
the
wheel
and
gave
it
a
vigorous
turn
poof
said
the
engine
sweetly
and
the
kind
word
encouraged
me
immensely
again
i
cranked
poof
poof
it
seemed
that
i
had
somehow
misunderstood
the
former
communication
and
it
was
therefore
repeated
with
emphasis
like
a
model
father
who
walks
the
floor
with
the
weeping
child
tenderly
seeking
the
offending
pin
i
looked
over
the
engine
what
have
i
neglected
said
i
intended
to
be
quite
logical
and
fair
in
the
matter
i
once
presided
over
a
country
newspaper
that
ran
its
presses
with
a
gasoline
engine
with
a
most
decided
artistic
temperament
that
engine
used
to
have
a
way
of
communing
silently
with
its
own
soul
right
in
the
middle
of
press
day
i
remembered
this
with
forebodings
i
remembered
how
firm
but
kind
i
was
obliged
to
be
with
that
old
engine
i
remembered
how
it
always
put
its
hands
in
its
pockets
and
took
an
extended
vacation
every
time
i
swore
at
it
i
decided
to
be
nothing
but
a
perfect
gentleman
with
this
engine
i
even
endeavored
to
be
a
jovial
good
fellow
what
is
it
little
one
said
i
mentally
does
its
little
carburetor
hurt
it
or
did
the
bad
man
strangle
it
with
that
horrid
old
gasoline
i
tenderly
jiggled
its
air
valve
fiddled
gently
with
its
lever
i
cranked
it
again
it
barked
at
me
like
a
dog
i
had
been
kind
to
it
and
it
barked
right
in
my
face
i
wanted
to
slap
it
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
saw
that
the
rapid
current
would
soon
carry
me
past
the
town
landing
i
seized
a
paddle
and
shoved
her
in
of
course
a
member
of
the
bureau
was
at
the
landing
he
had
with
him
a
bland
smile
and
a
choice
bit
of
information
having
trouble
with
your
engine
are
you
he
said
as
i
leaped
ashore
with
the
line
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
it
the
remark
was
indeed
illuminating
it
struck
me
with
the
force
of
an
inspiration
it
seemed
so
true
strange
that
i
had
thought
of
that
i
remarked
that
really
must
be
the
trouble
there
something
wrong
with
it
thanks
i
tied
the
boat
and
went
hoping
to
sidetrack
the
benevolent
member
of
that
ubiquitous
bureau
when
i
returned
i
found
half
a
dozen
other
benevolent
members
at
the
landing
they
were
holding
a
consultation
evidently
and
the
very
air
felt
gummy
with
latent
advice
what
the
matter
with
your
engine
they
chorused
why
there
something
wrong
with
it
i
explained
cheerfully
as
i
went
aboard
again
i
began
to
crank
praying
steadily
for
a
miracle
now
and
then
i
managed
to
coax
forth
a
gaseous
chortle
or
two
the
convention
on
the
landing
understood
every
chortle
in
a
truly
marvellous
way
it
the
that
sure
announced
one
with
an
air
of
finality
when
an
engine
has
run
for
a
while
the
gets
all
smutted
up
have
you
cleaned
your
no
jim
contradicted
another
it
all
in
the
oil
feed
look
how
she
puffs
it
in
the
oil
feed
plain
as
day
now
if
you
take
off
that
carburetor
and
i
cranked
on
heroically
it
in
the
timer
voluntered
another
you
see
that
little
brass
lever
back
there
well
you
take
and
remove
that
and
you
find
that
i
cranked
on
shamelessly
the
batteries
ai
no
good
growled
a
man
with
a
big
voice
that
reminded
me
of
a
booming
up
among
the
wind
instruments
in
a
medley
like
the
barber
who
owned
the
white
owl
i
stuck
to
my
business
i
cranked
on
it
ai
them
batteries
them
batteries
is
all
right
piped
a
weazened
little
man
who
had
been
grinning
wisely
at
the
lack
of
mechanical
ability
so
shamelessly
exposed
by
his
fellows
now
in
a
engine
he
explained
leisurely
with
a
knowing
squint
of
his
eyes
and
an
uplifted
explanatory
forefinger
in
a
engine
gentlemen
there
is
a
number
of
things
to
consider
now
if
you
take
and
remove
that
pull
out
the
piston
and
the
voice
of
the
expounder
was
suddenly
drowned
out
by
the
earsplitting
of
the
exhaust
the
miracle
had
happened
hooray
i
grasped
the
steering
cords
and
jammed
her
rudder
hard
to
port
her
screw
suddenly
started
at
full
speed
ahead
made
the
light
slim
craft
leap
like
a
horse
but
the
turn
was
too
short
she
thrust
her
sharp
haughty
nose
into
the
air
like
an
offended
lady
and
started
up
the
bank
after
that
information
bureau
if
a
tree
had
been
convenient
i
think
she
would
have
climbed
it
i
shut
her
down
went
that
time
chorused
the
information
bureau
coming
from
an
information
bureau
the
statement
was
marvellously
correct
but
i
had
suddenly
become
too
for
a
sharp
retort
if
you
will
please
throw
me
the
line
and
push
me
off
i
said
confidently
i
drop
out
into
the
current
i
dropped
out
now
for
putting
a
crimp
in
some
people
vanity
i
exulted
i
cranked
nothing
doing
i
cranked
some
more
no
news
from
the
crimping
department
i
continued
to
crank
also
i
continued
to
drift
somehow
the
current
seemed
to
have
increased
alarmingly
in
speed
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
of
merriment
i
looked
up
the
little
weazened
man
was
gesticulating
wildly
with
that
forefinger
of
his
he
was
explaining
something
the
information
bureau
steadily
dwindling
into
the
distance
was
not
listening
it
seemed
to
be
enjoying
itself
immensely
i
swallowed
a
word
that
tasted
bitter
as
it
went
down
then
i
cranked
again
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
to
do
it
was
a
hot
day
hot
sweat
blinded
me
and
trickled
off
the
tip
of
my
nose
my
hands
began
to
develop
blisters
finally
a
deep
disgust
seized
me
i
once
saw
a
lady
on
her
knees
in
the
dust
before
a
balky
auto
i
remembered
her
words
mean
thing
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
oh
you
mean
mean
thing
i
sat
down
in
front
of
that
engine
and
abandoned
myself
to
a
great
feeling
of
tenderness
and
chivalry
for
that
unfortunate
lady
in
that
moment
i
believe
i
would
have
fought
a
bear
for
her
oh
that
all
the
gasoline
engines
in
the
world
could
be
concentrated
somehow
into
one
big
woolly
scary
black
bear
how
i
could
have
set
my
teeth
in
its
neck
and
died
chewing
i
heard
a
roaring
of
waters
that
broke
my
vision
of
bear
fights
and
gentle
ladies
in
distress
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
me
i
saw
rapids
the
words
of
the
information
bureau
came
back
to
me
with
terrible
distinctness
why
her
light
timbers
will
go
to
pieces
on
the
first
rock
although
i
am
no
hero
i
did
get
frightened
i
got
sore
go
ahead
and
smash
yourself
up
if
you
like
i
cried
to
the
balky
craft
and
then
i
waited
to
see
her
do
it
she
swung
sharply
with
the
first
suck
of
the
rapids
struck
a
rock
struck
another
and
went
on
down
grinding
and
dragging
on
a
stony
reef
it
suddenly
came
to
me
that
this
was
what
they
called
the
grocondunez
rapids
i
remembered
that
they
said
the
name
meant
the
big
bridge
of
the
nose
the
name
had
a
powerful
fascination
for
me
i
wanted
to
hit
something
good
and
hard
somewhere
in
that
region
finally
she
swung
clear
of
the
reef
caught
the
swirl
of
the
main
current
and
started
for
new
orleans
with
the
bit
in
her
teeth
i
ready
to
arrive
in
new
orleans
at
once
i
had
made
other
arrangements
so
i
grasped
a
paddle
and
drove
her
into
shallow
water
i
leaped
out
in
the
cold
stream
and
threw
my
weight
against
her
pantingly
i
wondered
what
was
the
exact
distance
to
the
nearest
axe
i
resolved
to
crank
her
once
more
and
then
for
the
axe
hunt
i
leaned
over
the
gunwale
and
began
to
grind
for
the
life
of
me
i
do
know
just
what
i
did
to
her
but
it
seemed
that
she
had
taken
some
offence
without
the
least
warning
she
leaped
forward
at
speed
and
started
up
stream
with
that
haughty
head
of
her
thrust
skyward
i
clung
desperately
to
her
gunwale
and
she
dragged
me
insultingly
in
the
drink
she
made
a
soppy
rag
of
me
i
managed
to
scramble
aboard
something
after
the
fashion
of
a
who
mounts
at
a
gallop
but
the
way
she
i
forgot
the
ducking
and
forgave
her
with
all
my
heart
i
held
her
nose
well
out
into
the
channel
where
the
current
ran
with
swells
though
no
wind
blew
illustration
the
atom
i
under
construction
illustration
the
cable
ferry
towed
us
out
illustration
laid
up
with
a
broken
rudder
bucking
the
rapids
she
split
the
fast
water
over
her
nose
and
sent
it
aft
in
two
masses
that
hissed
about
her
like
angry
skirts
a
light
wake
spread
after
scarcely
agitating
the
surface
she
dragged
no
water
there
was
no
churning
at
her
stern
only
the
dull
drone
felt
rather
than
heard
beneath
the
rapid
banging
of
her
exhaust
told
me
how
the
honest
little
screw
thrust
hard
i
pushed
the
close
to
the
reversing
point
and
opened
her
throttle
wide
this
acted
like
a
on
the
flank
of
a
spirited
mare
she
shook
herself
quivering
through
all
her
light
pliable
construction
lifted
her
prow
another
inch
or
two
and
flung
the
rapids
behind
her
slim
fleet
and
hungry
for
distance
she
raced
toward
the
benton
landing
two
miles
up
in
my
anxiety
to
show
her
to
the
benevolent
ones
i
left
the
current
and
took
a
crosscut
over
a
rocky
ford
pebbles
flung
from
her
pounding
heels
showered
down
upon
me
i
climbed
forward
and
let
her
hammer
away
she
cleared
the
gravel
bar
and
as
she
plunged
past
the
now
silent
information
bureau
on
the
landing
condescendingly
i
waved
a
hand
at
them
and
went
on
splitting
water
we
shot
under
the
bridge
forged
into
the
crossing
current
passed
the
big
brick
hotel
where
a
considerable
number
came
out
to
salute
us
they
dubbed
her
the
fastest
boat
that
had
ever
climbed
that
current
i
learned
afterward
alas
i
was
getting
my
triumph
early
and
in
one
big
chunk
i
figure
that
that
one
huge
breakfast
of
triumph
if
properly
distributed
would
have
fed
me
through
the
whole
two
thousand
miles
of
and
and
yet
through
all
the
days
of
toil
that
followed
i
remained
truly
thankful
for
that
early
breakfast
the
kid
and
the
cornishman
busy
in
camp
with
the
packing
for
the
voyage
had
shared
in
the
gloom
of
my
temporary
defeat
but
now
as
i
plunged
past
them
i
could
see
them
leaping
into
the
air
and
cracking
their
heels
together
with
delight
they
had
wet
every
plank
of
her
with
their
sweat
and
they
were
as
proud
as
i
in
the
light
of
the
following
days
their
delight
dwindled
into
a
pathetic
thing
i
held
her
on
her
course
reached
the
bend
a
mile
above
swung
round
and
discovered
that
she
had
only
then
begun
to
lift
her
heels
with
the
rapid
current
to
aid
her
speed
was
truly
wonderful
she
could
have
kept
pace
with
any
respectable
freight
train
at
least
i
indulged
in
a
little
feverish
mental
calculation
she
could
make
with
the
minimum
current
eighteen
miles
per
hour
every
day
meant
fifteen
hours
of
light
sioux
city
was
two
thousand
miles
away
we
could
reach
sioux
city
easily
in
ten
days
of
actual
running
while
i
was
covering
that
fast
mile
back
to
camp
i
saw
the
passing
sioux
city
with
an
air
of
contempt
i
developed
a
sort
of
unreasoning
hunger
for
new
orleans
a
kind
of
violent
thirst
for
the
gulf
of
mexico
nothing
short
of
these
it
seemed
to
me
could
be
worthy
of
so
fleet
a
craft
when
i
shoved
her
nose
into
the
landing
i
found
that
my
companions
thoroughly
agreed
with
me
all
that
night
in
my
restless
sleep
i
drove
speed
boats
at
a
terrific
pace
through
impossible
channels
and
scyllas
and
the
little
cornishman
fought
angry
seas
and
heard
a
shrieking
in
the
cordage
and
felt
the
salt
spume
on
his
face
i
wonder
why
i
am
always
dreaming
that
he
said
atavism
i
ventured
and
he
regarded
me
narrowly
as
though
i
might
be
maligning
his
character
in
some
way
at
dawn
we
had
already
eaten
and
were
loading
the
for
the
voyage
with
her
cargo
she
drew
eighteen
inches
of
water
at
full
speed
she
would
squat
four
inches
it
was
the
first
of
august
and
the
water
which
had
reached
in
the
spring
its
highest
point
for
twenty
years
had
been
falling
rapidly
and
now
promised
to
go
far
below
the
average
mark
we
had
ahead
of
us
a
long
voyage
every
mile
of
which
was
strange
water
once
again
i
went
over
that
feverish
calculation
this
time
i
was
more
generous
i
decided
upon
fifteen
days
the
cable
ferry
towed
us
out
beyond
the
gravel
bars
that
during
the
last
week
had
been
slowly
lifting
their
bleached
masses
higher
in
we
cut
loose
at
the
first
turn
the
engine
started
we
were
going
at
a
good
clip
when
suddenly
the
engine
changed
its
mind
squash
it
said
wearily
then
it
let
off
a
gasoline
sigh
and
went
into
a
peaceful
sleep
we
had
reached
the
brick
hotel
we
pulled
in
with
the
paddles
and
tied
up
the
information
bureau
was
there
and
at
once
went
into
consultation
i
looking
for
an
engine
doctor
i
said
how
about
blank
they
tell
me
he
knows
the
unknowable
best
man
with
an
engine
in
town
sad
one
for
gracious
sake
keep
that
man
away
from
your
engine
if
you
want
it
ruined
said
others
a
man
who
can
arouse
a
diversity
of
opinions
is
at
least
a
man
of
originality
i
went
after
that
man
he
came
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
a
monkey
wrench
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
patient
how
that
word
fit
and
after
some
time
he
said
he
unscrewed
this
and
whistled
awhile
he
unscrewed
that
and
whistled
some
more
then
he
screwed
up
both
this
and
that
and
cranked
her
said
the
engine
whereat
the
doctor
smiled
knowingly
it
was
plain
that
she
was
an
open
book
to
him
what
is
the
trouble
said
i
with
that
tone
of
voice
you
use
in
a
it
appeared
to
be
appendicitis
muttered
the
doctor
shall
i
get
another
i
asked
half
apologetically
better
grunted
the
doctor
i
chased
down
an
automobile
owner
and
a
launch
owner
and
a
man
who
had
a
small
i
was
eloquent
in
my
appeal
for
i
made
a
very
fine
collection
of
them
and
hastened
back
to
the
doctor
he
did
seem
to
appreciate
my
efforts
he
had
the
patient
on
the
operating
table
everything
was
either
unscrewed
or
pulled
out
he
was
carefully
scrutinizing
the
wreck
for
more
things
to
screw
out
locate
the
trouble
i
ventured
buzzer
out
of
whack
replied
the
man
of
awe
have
to
get
another
in
times
of
sickness
even
the
sternest
man
submits
to
medical
tyranny
i
ran
down
a
man
who
once
owned
a
power
boat
and
he
had
a
spark
coil
he
finally
agreed
to
forgo
the
pleasure
of
possessing
it
for
a
suitable
reward
considering
the
size
of
that
reward
he
had
undoubtedly
become
greatly
attached
to
his
i
returned
in
triumph
to
the
doctor
he
was
now
screwing
up
all
that
he
had
previously
unscrewed
think
she
go
now
i
pleaded
he
screwed
up
several
dozen
things
and
whistled
a
while
then
the
oracle
gave
voice
the
batteries
wo
do
they
awful
weak
with
a
bitter
heart
i
turned
on
my
heel
and
went
forth
once
more
electrical
supplies
were
not
on
sale
at
any
of
the
stores
but
i
found
a
number
of
gentlemen
who
were
evidently
connoisseurs
in
the
battery
business
they
had
batteries
of
which
they
were
extremely
fond
they
parted
with
some
of
superior
quality
upon
the
consideration
of
a
friendly
regard
for
me
and
a
slight
emolument
on
my
part
i
was
evidently
very
popular
at
a
breathless
speed
i
returned
to
to
the
doctor
he
had
vanished
rumor
had
it
that
he
had
gone
home
to
lunch
for
the
sun
was
now
high
so
far
as
i
know
he
is
still
at
lunch
several
things
were
yet
unscrewed
i
fell
to
work
wherever
anything
seemed
to
make
a
snug
fit
i
screwed
it
in
other
remaining
things
i
drove
into
convenient
holes
all
the
while
i
begged
blind
fate
to
guide
me
then
i
connected
the
batteries
supplied
the
new
selected
a
new
at
random
and
screwed
it
in
having
done
various
things
i
carefully
surveyed
my
environs
for
a
lady
there
were
no
ladies
present
so
i
spoke
out
freely
and
now
said
i
having
exhausted
my
vocabulary
i
shall
crank
bill
and
the
kid
sat
on
a
pile
of
rocks
looking
very
sullen
for
some
reason
or
other
they
seemed
to
doubt
that
engine
i
do
know
how
long
i
cranked
i
know
only
that
the
impossible
happened
the
boat
started
for
the
hotel
piazza
i
did
shut
her
down
this
time
i
leaped
out
and
took
her
by
the
nose
putting
our
shoulders
against
the
power
of
the
screw
we
walked
her
out
into
the
current
headed
her
down
stream
and
scrambled
in
wet
to
the
ears

chapter
v
through
the
region
of
weir
we
awoke
with
light
hearts
on
the
second
morning
of
the
voyage
all
about
us
was
the
sacred
silence
of
the
wilderness
dawn
the
coming
sun
had
smitten
the
chill
night
air
into
a
ghostly
fog
that
lay
upon
the
valley
like
a
fairy
lake
we
were
at
the
rim
of
the
bad
lands
and
there
were
no
birds
to
sing
but
crows
wheeling
about
a
sandstone
summit
flung
doleful
voices
downward
into
the
morning
hush
the
spirit
of
the
place
grown
vocal
cloaked
with
the
fog
our
breakfast
fire
of
driftwood
glowed
ruddily
what
is
there
about
the
tang
of
in
a
lonesome
place
that
fills
one
with
glories
that
seem
half
memory
and
half
dream
crouched
on
my
haunches
shivering
just
enough
to
feel
the
beauty
there
is
in
fire
i
needed
only
to
close
my
eyes
smarting
with
the
smoke
to
feel
myself
the
first
man
huddled
close
to
the
first
flame
blooming
like
a
mystic
flower
in
the
chill
dawn
of
the
world
perhaps
that
is
what
an
outing
is
for
to
strip
one
down
to
the
lean
essentials
press
in
upon
one
the
glorious
privilege
of
being
self
unique
in
all
the
universe
of
innumerable
unique
things
crouched
close
to
your
wilderness
campfire
the
great
vision
comes
easily
out
of
the
smoke
once
again
you
feel
the
bigness
of
your
world
the
tremendous
significance
of
everything
in
it
including
yourself
and
a
sadness
grips
you
living
in
the
flesh
seems
so
transient
almost
a
pitiful
thing
in
the
last
analysis
but
somehow
you
feel
that
there
is
something
bigger
not
beyond
it
but
all
about
it
continually
and
you
wonder
that
you
ever
hated
anyone
you
know
somehow
there
in
the
smoky
silence
why
men
are
noble
or
ignoble
why
they
lie
or
die
for
a
principle
why
they
kill
or
suffer
martyrdom
why
they
love
and
hate
and
fight
why
women
smile
under
burdens
sin
splendidly
or
sordidly
and
why
hearts
sometimes
break
and
expanded
by
the
bigness
of
the
empty
silent
spaces
about
you
like
a
spirit
independent
of
it
and
outside
of
it
all
you
love
the
great
red
straining
heart
of
man
more
than
you
could
ever
love
it
at
your
desk
in
town
and
you
want
to
get
up
and
move
push
on
through
purple
distances
whither
oh
anywhere
will
do
what
you
seek
is
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
it
is
in
the
azure
of
distance
it
is
just
behind
the
glow
of
the
sunset
and
close
under
the
dawn
and
the
glorious
thing
about
it
is
that
you
know
you
never
find
it
until
you
reach
that
lone
ghostly
land
where
the
north
star
sets
perhaps
you
merely
glad
to
know
that
you
not
a
vegetable
and
that
the
trail
never
really
ends
anywhere
just
now
however
the
longing
for
the
abstract
had
the
semblance
of
a
longing
for
the
concrete
it
always
has
that
semblance
for
that
matter
you
never
really
want
what
you
think
you
are
seeking
touch
the
substance
and
away
you
go
after
the

sailing

a

illustration
typical
rapids
on
upper
missouri
around
the
bend
lay
sioux
city
around
what
bend
what
matter
somewhere
down
stream
the
last
bend
lay
and
in
between
lay
the
playing
of
the
game
any
bend
will
do
to
sail
around
there
a
lot
of
fun
in
merely
being
able
to
move
about
and
do
things
for
this
reason
i
am
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
whenever
i
think
that
through
some
slight
error
in
the
cosmic
process
the
life
forces
that
glow
in
me
might
have
been
flung
into
a
turnip
the
thought
is
truly
appalling
is
it
the
avoidance
of
that
one
awful
possibility
is
enough
to
make
any
man
feel
lucky
all
his
life
it
such
fun
to
awaken
in
the
morning
with
all
your
legs
and
arms
and
eyes
and
ears
about
you
waiting
to
be
used
again
so
strong
was
this
thought
in
me
when
we
cast
off
that
even
the
memory
of
bill
amateurish
pancakes
could
keep
back
the
whistle
the
current
of
the
black
bluffs
rapids
whisked
us
from
the
bank
with
a
giddy
speed
spun
us
about
a
bend
and
landed
us
in
a
long
quiet
lake
contrary
to
the
average
opinion
the
upper
missouri
is
merely
a
succession
of
lakes
and
rapids
in
the
season
this
statement
should
be
italicised
when
you
are
pushing
down
with
the
power
of
your
arms
alone
the
rapids
show
you
how
fast
you
want
to
go
and
the
lakes
show
you
that
you
ca
go
that
fast
for
the
teaching
of
patience
the
arrangement
is
admirable
but
when
head
winds
blow
a
reach
means
about
a
fight
this
being
a
very
invigorating
morning
however
the
engine
decided
to
take
a
constitutional
it
ran
below
the
mouth
of
the
marias
river
twenty
minutes
later
we
grounded
on
archer
bar
and
shut
down
after
dragging
her
off
the
gravel
we
discovered
that
the
engine
wished
to
sleep
no
amount
of
cranking
could
arouse
it
now
and
then
it
would
say
feebly
rolling
its
wheel
a
revolution
or
two
like
a
brushing
off
a
fly
with
a
languid
hand
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
out
of
the
west
the
stream
ran
east
and
northeast
we
hastily
rigged
a
tarp
on
a
pair
of
oars
spliced
for
a
mast
and
proceeded
at
a
pace
the
light
breeze
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
slow
stream
yet
still
the
sail
made
on
a
pleasant
noise
till
noon
in
the
lazy
heat
of
the
mounting
sun
tempered
by
the
cool
river
draught
the
yellow
sandstone
bluffs
whimsically
decorated
with
sparse
patches
of
greenery
seemed
to
waver
as
though
seen
through
shimmering
silken
gauze
and
over
it
all
was
the
hush
of
a
dream
except
when
in
a
spasmodic
freshening
of
the
breeze
the
rude
mast
creaked
and
a
sleepy
watery
murmur
grew
up
for
a
moment
at
the
wake
now
and
then
at
a
break
in
the
bluffs
where
a
little
coulee
entered
the
stream
the
gray
masses
of
the
bushes
lifted
like
smoke
and
from
them
flashed
the
vivid
scarlet
of
the
smiting
the
general
dreaminess
like
a
haughty
cry
in
a
silence
a
wilderness
indeed
it
seemed
that
waste
land
of
which
tennyson
sang
where
no
man
comes
nor
hath
come
since
the
making
of
the
world
i
thought
of
the
steamboats
and
the
mackinaws
and
the
and
the
thousands
of
men
who
had
pushed
through
this
and
the
thought
was
unconvincing
fairies
may
have
lived
here
indeed
and
in
the
youth
of
the
world
a
glad
young
race
of
gods
might
have
dreamed
gloriously
among
the
yellow
crags
but
surely
we
were
the
first
men
who
had
ever
passed
that
way
and
should
be
the
last
suddenly
the
light
breeze
boomed
up
into
a
gale
the
with
bellying
sail
leaped
forward
down
the
roughening
water
swung
about
a
bend
raced
with
a
quartering
wind
down
the
next
reach
shot
across
another
bend
and
lay
drifting
in
a
golden
calm
still
above
us
the
great
wind
buzzed
in
the
crags
like
a
swarm
of
giant
bees
and
the
waters
about
us
lay
like
a
sheet
of
flawless
glass
with
paddles
we
pushed
on
lazily
for
an
hour
at
the
next
bend
where
the
river
turned
into
the
west
the
great
gale
that
had
been
roaring
above
us
suddenly
struck
us
full
in
front
sucking
up
river
between
the
wall
rocks
on
either
side
its
force
was
terrific
you
tried
to
talk
while
facing
it
and
it
took
your
breath
away
in
a
few
minutes
in
spite
of
our
efforts
with
the
paddles
we
lay
pounding
on
the
shallows
of
the
opposite
shore
we
got
out
two
went
forward
with
the
line
and
the
third
pushed
at
the
stern
progress
was
slow
no
more
than
a
mile
an
hour
the
clear
water
of
the
upper
river
is
always
cold
and
the
great
wind
chilled
the
air
even
under
the
august
noon
it
took
brisk
work
to
keep
one
teeth
from
chattering
the
bank
we
were
following
became
a
precipice
rising
sheer
from
the
river
edge
and
the
water
deepened
until
we
could
no
longer
wade
we
got
in
and
poled
on
to
the
next
shallows
often
for
many
minutes
at
a
time
barely
holding
our
own
against
the
stiff
gusts
for
two
hours
we
dragged
the
heavily
laden
boat
sometimes
walking
the
bank
sometimes
wading
in
sometimes
poling
often
swimming
with
the
line
from
one
shallow
to
another
and
the
struggle
ended
as
suddenly
as
it
began
upon
rounding
the
second
bend
the
head
wind
became
a
stern
wind
driving
us
on
at
a
jolly
clip
until
nightfall
during
the
late
afternoon
we
came
upon
a
place
where
the
great
northern
railroad
touches
the
river
for
the
last
time
in
five
hundred
miles
here
we
saw
two
italian
section
hands
whiling
away
their
sunday
with
fishing
rods
i
went
ashore
hoping
to
buy
some
fish
neither
of
the
two
could
speak
english
and
italian
sounds
to
me
merely
like
an
unintelligible
singing
however
they
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
fish
were
not
for
sale
and
my
proffered
coin
had
no
persuasive
powers
still
wanting
those
fish
i
rolled
a
smoke
carelessly
whistling
the
while
a
strain
from
an
opera
i
had
once
heard
for
some
reason
or
other
that
strain
had
been
in
my
head
all
day
i
had
gotten
up
in
the
morning
with
it
i
had
whistled
it
during
the
fight
with
the
head
wind
the
kid
called
it
that
dago
tune
i
think
it
was
something
from
suddenly
one
of
the
little
italians
dropped
his
rod
stood
up
to
his
full
height
lifted
his
arms
very
much
after
the
manner
of
an
orchestra
leader
and
joined
in
with
me
i
stopped
because
i
saw
that
he
whistle
he
carried
it
on
with
much
expression
to
the
last
thin
note
with
all
the
ache
of
the
world
in
it
and
then
he
grinned
at
me
verdi
he
said
sweetly
i
applauded
whereat
the
little
italian
produced
a
bag
of
tobacco
we
sat
down
on
the
rocks
and
smoked
together
holding
a
wordless
but
perfectly
intelligble
conversation
of
pleasant
grins
that
night
we
had
fish
for
supper
i
got
them
for
a
song
or
rather
for
a
whistle
i
was
fed
with
more
than
fish
and
i
went
to
sleep
that
night
with
a
glorious
thought
for
a
pillow
truth
expressed
as
art
is
the
universal
language
one
immortal
strain
from
verdi
poorly
whistled
in
a
wilderness
had
made
a
dago
and
a
dutchman
brothers
scarcely
had
the
crackling
of
the
ruddy
log
lulled
us
to
sleep
when
the
night
had
flitted
over
like
a
shadow
and
we
were
cooking
breakfast
a
lone
gray
wolf
sitting
on
his
haunches
a
hundred
paces
away
regarded
us
curiously
doubtless
we
were
new
to
his
generation
for
in
the
evening
dusk
we
had
drifted
well
into
the
bad
lands
bad
lands
rather
the
land
of
awe
a
light
stern
wind
came
up
with
the
sun
during
the
previous
evening
we
had
rigged
a
and
noiselessly
we
glided
down
the
glinting
trail
of
crystal
into
the
region
of
weir
on
either
hand
the
sandstone
cliffs
reared
their
yellow
masses
against
the
cloudless
sky
worn
by
the
ebbing
floods
of
a
prehistoric
sea
carved
by
the
winds
and
rains
of
ages
they
presented
a
panorama
of
wonders
rows
of
huge
colonial
mansions
with
pillared
porticoes
looked
from
their
dizzy
terraces
across
the
stream
to
where
soaring
mosques
and
mystic
domes
of
worship
caught
the
sun
it
was
all
like
the
visible
dream
of
a
master
architect
gone
mad
gaunt
sinister
ruins
of
medieval
castles
sprawled
down
the
slopes
of
unassailable
summits
grim
brown
towers
haughtily
crenellated
scowled
defiance
on
the
unappearing
foe
titanic
stools
of
stone
dotted
barren
garden
slopes
where
surely
gods
had
once
strolled
in
that
far
time
when
the
stars
sang
and
the
moon
was
young
dark
red
walls
of
regularly
laid
stone
huge
as
that
the
chinese
flung
before
the
advance
of
the
northern
hordes
held
imaginary
empires
asunder
poised
on
a
dizzy
peak
jove
eagle
stared
into
the
eye
of
the
sun
and
raised
his
wings
for
the
flight
deferred
these
many
centuries
kneeling
face
to
face
upon
a
lonesome
summit
their
hands
clasped
before
them
their
backs
bent
as
with
the
burdens
of
the
race
two
women
prayed
the
old
old
woman
prayer
the
ruins
of
a
vast
cathedral
lay
along
the
water
edge
and
all
about
it
was
a
hush
of
worship
and
near
it
arose
the
pointed
pipes
of
a
colossal
organ
with
the
summer
silence
for
music
with
a
lazy
sail
we
drifted
through
this
place
of
awe
and
for
once
i
had
no
regrets
about
that
engine
the
popping
of
the
exhaust
would
have
seemed
sacrilegious
in
this
holy
quiet
seldom
do
men
pass
that
way
it
is
out
of
the
path
of
the
tourist
no
excursion
steamers
ply
those
awesome
river
reaches
across
the
sacred
whiteness
of
that
cathedral
imposing
mass
no
sign
has
ever
been
painted
telling
you
the
merits
of
the
best
cigar
in
the
world
few
besides
the
hawks
and
the
crows
would
see
it
if
it
were
there
and
yet
for
all
the
quiet
in
this
land
of
wonder
somehow
you
can
not
feel
that
the
place
is
unpeopled
surely
you
think
invisible
knights
clash
in
tourney
under
those
frowning
towers
surely
a
lovelorn
maiden
spins
at
that
castle
window
weaving
her
heartache
into
the
magic
figures
of
her
loom
stately
dames
must
move
behind
the
shut
doors
of
those
pillared
mansions
devotees
mutter
oriental
prayers
beneath
those
domes
and
amid
the
awful
inner
silence
of
that
cathedral
priests
lift
wan
faces
to
their
god
under
the
beat
of
the
high
sun
the
light
stern
wind
fell
the
slack
sail
drooped
like
a
thing
idly
drifting
on
the
slow
glassy
flood
we
seemed
only
an
incidental
portion
of
this
dream
in
which
the
deepest
passions
of
man
were
bodied
forth
in
eternal
fixity
towers
of
battle
domes
of
prayer
fanes
of
worship
and
then
the
kneeling
women
somehow
one
could
whistle
there
bill
and
the
kid
little
given
to
sentiment
sat
quietly
and
stared
late
in
the
afternoon
we
found
ourselves
out
of
this
region
of
weir
great
wall
rocks
soared
above
us
consulting
our
map
we
found
that
we
were
nearing
eagle
rapids
the
first
of
a
turbulent
series
i
had
fondly
anticipated
shooting
them
all
under
power
so
once
more
i
decided
to
go
over
that
engine
we
landed
at
the
wooded
mouth
of
a
little
ravine
having
made
a
trifle
over
twenty
miles
that
day
with
those
tools
of
the
engine
doctor
an
air
of
mystery
and
a
i
unscrewed
everything
that
appeared
to
have
a
thread
on
it
and
pulled
out
the
other
things
the
odds
i
figured
were
in
my
favor
a
sick
engine
is
useless
and
i
felt
assured
of
either
killing
or
curing
i
did
something
i
do
know
what
but
having
achieved
the
complete
screwing
up
and
driving
in
of
things
so
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
we
were
up
early
eager
for
the
shooting
of
rapids
we
had
understood
from
the
conversation
of
the
seemingly
wise
that
eagle
rapids
was
the
first
of
a
series
that
made
the
other
rapids
we
had
passed
through
look
like
mere
ripples
on
the
surface
in
some
of
those
we
had
gone
at
a
very
good
clip
and
several
times
we
had
lost
our
rudder
i
remembered
how
the
steamboats
used
to
be
obliged
to
throw
out
cables
and
slowly
wind
themselves
up
with
the
power
of
the
steam
nigger
i
also
remembered
the
words
of
father
de
smet
there
are
many
rapids
ten
of
which
are
very
difficult
to
ascend
and
very
dangerous
to
go
down
we
had
intended
from
the
very
first
to
get
wrecked
in
one
or
all
of
these
rapids
for
this
reason
we
had
distributed
forward
aft
and
amidships
eight
cans
soldered
the
frail
craft
would
we
figured
be
punctured
the
cans
would
displace
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
water
and
the
boat
and
engine
submerged
would
lose
a
certain
weight
i
had
made
the
gruesome
calculation
with
fond
attention
to
detail
i
decided
that
she
should
be
wrecked
quite
arithmetically
we
should
be
able
the
figures
said
to
recover
the
engine
and
patch
the
boat
we
had
provided
three
but
one
had
been
stolen
so
i
had
fancied
what
a
bully
fight
one
might
have
if
he
should
be
thrown
out
into
the
mad
waters
without
a
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
it
satisfactorily
it
is
one
of
the
paradoxes
but
human
nature
seems
to
take
a
weird
delight
in
placing
in
jeopardy
that
which
is
dearest
even
a
coward
with
his
fingers
clenched
desperately
on
the
ragged
edge
of
hazard
feels
an
inexplicable
thrill
of
glory
having
several
times
been
decently
scared
i
know
one
likes
to
take
a
sly
peep
behind
the
curtain
of
the
big
play
hoping
perhaps
to
get
a
slight
hint
as
to
what
machinery
hoists
the
moon
and
what
sort
of
contrivance
flings
the
thunder
and
lightning
and
many
other
things
that
are
none
of
his
business
only
to
be
sure
he
intends
to
get
away
safely
with
his
information
when
you
think
you
see
your
finish
bowing
to
receive
you
something
happens
in
your
head
it
like
a
sultry
sheet
of
rapid
fire
lapping
up
for
a
moment
the
night
and
discovering
a
strange
land
to
you
and
it
really
good
for
you
under
half
speed
we
cruised
through
the
windless
golden
morning
and
the
lonesome
canyon
echoed
and
with
the
joyful
chortle
of
the
resurrected
engine
we
had
covered
about
ten
miles
when
a
strange
sighing
sound
grew
up
about
us
it
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
soaring
walls
of
rock
it
seemed
faint
yet
it
arose
above
the
din
of
the
explosions
drowned
out
the
droning
of
the
screw
steadily
the
sound
increased
like
the
ghost
of
a
great
wind
it
moaned
and
sighed
about
us
little
by
little
a
new
note
crept
in
a
sibilant
metallic
note
as
of
a
tense
sheet
of
silk
drawn
rapidly
over
a
thin
steel
edge
illustration
wolf
point
the
first
town
in
miles
illustration
entrance
to
the
bad
lands
we
knew
it
to
be
the
mourning
voice
of
the
eagle
rapids
but
far
as
we
could
see
the
river
was
quiet
as
a
lake
we
jogged
on
for
a
mile
with
the
invisible
moaning
presence
about
us
it
was
somewhat
like
the
intangible
something
you
feel
about
a
powerful
but
sinister
personality
the
golden
morning
was
saturated
with
it
suddenly
turning
a
sharp
bend
about
the
wall
of
rock
that
flanked
the
channel
a
wind
of
noise
struck
us
it
was
like
the
hissing
of
innumerable
snakes
against
a
tonal
background
of
muffled
continuous
thunder
a
hundred
yards
before
us
was
eagle
rapids
a
forbidding
patch
of
writhing
whitening
water
pricked
with
the
upward
thrust
of
toothlike
rocks
the
first
sight
of
it
turned
the
inside
of
me
temporarily
wrecks
and
the
arithmetic
of
them
had
little
charm
for
me
i
seized
the
intending
to
shut
down
instead
i
threw
it
wide
open
with
the
resulting
leap
of
the
craft
all
the
gray
went
out
of
me
i
grasped
the
rudder
ropes
and
aimed
at
a
point
where
the
sinuous
current
sucked
through
a
passage
in
the
rocks
like
a
lean
flame
through
a
windy
flue
did
you
ever
hear
music
that
made
you
see
purple
it
was
that
sort
of
purple
i
saw
or
did
i
hear
it
like
music
when
we
plunged
under
full
speed
into
the
first
suck
of
the
rapids
we
seemed
a
conscious
arrow
hurled
through
a
gray
writhing
world
the
light
of
which
was
noise
and
then
suddenly
the
quiet
golden
morning
flashed
back
and
we
were
ripping
the
placid
waters
of
a
lake
the
kid
broke
out
into
boisterous
laughter
that
irritated
me
strangely
where
the
devil
do
you
suppose
our
are
he
bawled
they
clear
down
under
all
the
cargo
a
world
of
wonderful
beauty
was
forging
past
us
in
the
golden
calm
the
scintillant
sheet
of
water
seemed
to
be
rushing
backward
splitting
itself
over
the
prow
like
a
fabric
woven
of
gold
and
silver
drawn
rapidly
against
a
keen
stationary
blade
the
sheer
cliffs
had
fallen
away
into
slopes
and
rocks
flung
notes
of
scarlet
and
gold
through
the
sombre
green
of
the
pines
like
the
riotous
treble
cries
of
an
organ
pricking
the
sullen
murmur
of
the
bass
so
still
were
the
clean
waters
that
we
seemed
midway
between
two
skies
we
skirted
the
base
of
a
conical
rock
that
towered
three
hundred
feet
above
us
a
titan
sentinel
it
was
the
famous
sentinel
rock
of
the
old
steamboat
days
i
shut
the
engine
down
to
quarter
speed
for
somehow
from
the
dizzy
summit
a
sad
dream
fell
upon
me
and
bade
me
linger
i
stared
down
into
the
cold
crystal
waters
at
the
base
of
the
rock
mosses
sickly
green
pale
feverish
red
yellow
like
fear
black
like
despair
purple
like
the
lips
of
a
strangled
man
clung
there
i
remembered
an
old
spring
i
used
to
haunt
when
i
was
just
old
enough
to
be
awed
by
the
fact
of
life
and
frightened
at
the
possibility
of
death
just
such
mosses
grew
in
the
depths
of
that
spring
i
used
to
stare
into
it
for
hours
it
fascinated
me
in
a
terrible
way
i
thought
death
looked
like
that
even
now
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
swim
long
in
clear
waters
with
those
fearful
colors
under
me
i
am
sure
they
found
ophelia
floating
like
a
ghastly
lily
in
such
a
place
filled
with
a
shadow
of
the
old
childish
dread
i
looked
up
to
the
austere
summit
of
the
sentinel
scarred
and
haggard
with
time
it
caught
the
sun
i
thought
of
how
long
it
had
stood
there
just
so
under
the
intermittent
flashing
of
moon
and
sun
and
star
since
first
its
flinty
peak
had
pricked
through
the
hot
spume
of
prehistoric
seas
fantastic
reptiles
winged
and
finned
and
fanged
had
basked
upon
it
grotesque
tentative
vehicles
of
the
flame
of
life
and
then
these
flashed
out
and
the
wild
sea
fell
and
the
land
arose
hideous
and
naked
a
steaming
ooze
fetid
with
gasping
life
and
all
the
while
this
scarred
sentinel
stared
unmoved
and
then
a
riot
of
giant
vegetation
all
about
it
divinely
extravagant
as
fire
and
this
too
flashed
out
like
the
impossible
dream
of
a
god
too
young
and
the
great
change
came
and
the
paradox
of
frost
was
in
the
world
stripping
life
down
to
the
lean
essentials
till
only
the
sane
capable
things
might
live
and
still
the
titan
stared
as
in
the
beginning
and
then
men
were
in
the
land
gaunt
terrible
men
loving
and
hating
and
la
verendrye
forged
past
it
and
lewis
and
clark
toiled
under
it
through
these
waters
of
awful
quiet
and
then
the
bull
boats
and
the
mackinaws
and
the
packets
and
all
these
flashed
out
and
still
it
stood
unmoved
and
i
came
and
i
too
would
flash
out
and
all
men
after
me
and
all
life
i
viewed
the
colossal
watcher
with
something
like
terror
the
aspect
of
death
about
its
base
and
that
cynical
glimmer
of
sunlight
at
its
top
i
flung
the
throttle
open
and
we
leaped
forward
through
the
river
hush
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
this
thing
that
had
seen
so
much
of
life
and
cared
so
little
it
depressed
me
strangely
it
thrust
bitter
questions
within
the
charmed
circle
of
my
ego
it
gave
me
an
almost
morbid
desire
for
speed
as
though
there
were
some
place
i
should
reach
before
the
terrible
question
should
be
answered
against
me
we
fled
down
five
or
six
miles
of
depressingly
quiet
waters
once
again
the
wall
rocks
closed
about
us
we
seemed
to
be
going
at
a
tediously
slow
pace
yet
the
two
thin
streams
of
water
rushed
hissing
from
prow
to
stern
a
strange
mood
was
upon
me
once
when
i
was
a
boy
and
far
from
home
i
awoke
in
the
night
with
a
bed
of
railroad
ties
under
me
and
the
chill
black
blanket
of
the
darkness
about
me
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
run
through
that
damned
night
anywhere
just
so
i
went
fast
enough
stopping
only
when
exhaustion
should
drag
me
down
and
yet
i
was
afraid
of
nothing
tangible
hunger
and
the
stranger
had
sharpened
whatever
blue
steel
there
was
in
my
nature
i
was
afraid
of
being
still
were
you
ever
a
homesick
boy
too
proud
to
tell
the
truth
about
it
i
felt
something
of
that
boy
ache
as
we
shot
in
among
the
wall
rocks
again
it
was
a
psychic
hunger
for
something
that
does
not
exist
oh
to
attain
the
terrible
speed
one
experiences
in
a
to
get
somewhere
before
it
is
too
late
before
the
black
curtain
drops
to
some
this
may
sound
merely
like
the
grating
of
overwrought
nerves
but
it
is
more
than
that
all
religions
grew
out
of
that
most
human
mood
and
whenever
one
is
deeply
moved
he
feels
it
for
even
the
most
person
of
us
all
has
now
and
then
a
suspicion
that
this
life
is
merely
episodic
that
curtain
after
curtain
of
darkness
is
to
be
pierced
world
after
world
of
consciousness
and
light
to
be
passed
through
once
more
the
rocks
took
on
grotesque
shapes
utterly
in
their
suggestiveness
those
who
have
marveled
at
the
hudson
beauty
should
drop
down
this
lonesome
stretch
we
shot
through
the
elbow
rapids
at
the
base
of
the
great
rock
it
was
deep
and
safe
much
like
an
exaggerated
it
ran
in
heavy
swells
yet
the
day
was
windless
in
the
late
afternoon
we
shot
the
dead
man
rapids
a
very
turbulent
and
rocky
stretch
of
water
we
went
through
at
a
speed
and
began
to
develop
a
slight
contempt
for
fast
waters
that
night
we
camped
at
the
mouth
of
the
judith
river
on
the
site
of
the
now
forgotten
fort
chardon
we
had
made
only
miles
in
four
days
it
began
to
appear
that
we
might
be
obliged
to
finish
on
skates
we
were
up
and
off
with
the
first
gray
of
the
morning
we
knew
dauphin
rapids
to
be
about
seventeen
miles
below
and
since
this
particular
patch
of
water
had
by
far
the
greatest
reputation
of
all
the
rapids
we
were
eager
to
make
its
acquaintance
the
engine
began
to
show
unmistakable
signs
of
getting
tired
of
its
job
now
and
then
it
barked
spitefully
had
half
a
notion
to
stop
changed
its
mind
ran
faster
than
it
should
wheezed
and
slowed
down
acting
in
an
altogether
unreasonable
way
but
it
kept
the
screw
humming
nevertheless
fortunately
it
was
going
at
a
mad
clip
when
we
sighted
the
dauphin
there
was
not
that
sibilance
and
thunder
that
had
turned
me
a
bit
gray
inside
at
first
sight
of
the
eagle
the
channel
was
narrow
and
no
rocks
appeared
above
the
surface
but
speed
there
and
the
almost
noiseless
rolling
of
the
swift
flood
ahead
had
a
more
formidable
appearance
than
that
of
the
eagle
rocks
above
the
surface
are
not
much
to
be
feared
when
you
have
power
and
a
good
rudder
but
we
drew
about
inches
of
water
and
i
thought
of
the
rocks
under
the
surface
i
had
however
only
a
moment
to
think
for
we
were
already
traveling
a
good
eighteen
miles
and
when
the
main
swirl
of
the
rapids
seized
us
we
no
doubt
reached
i
was
grasping
the
rudder
ropes
and
we
were
all
grinning
a
sort
of
idiotic
satisfaction
at
the
amazing
spurt
of
speed
when
something
was
about
to
happen
the
kid
and
i
were
sitting
behind
the
engine
in
order
to
hold
her
screw
down
to
solid
water
bill
decorated
with
a
grin
sat
amidships
facing
us
i
caught
a
pink
flash
in
the
swirl
just
under
our
bow
and
then
the
boat
reared
like
a
taking
a
fence
the
kid
shot
forward
over
the
engine
and
knocked
the
grin
off
bill
face
clinging
desperately
to
the
rudder
ropes
i
saw
for
a
brief
moment
a
good
of
the
frail
craft
thrust
skyward
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
then
she
stuck
her
nose
in
the
water
and
her
screw
came
up
howling
like
seven
devils
in
the
air
behind
me
instinctively
i
struck
the
the
howling
stopped
and
we
were
floating
in
the
slow
waters
below
dauphin
rapids
all
the
cargo
had
forged
forward
and
the
persons
of
bill
and
the
kid
were
considerably
tangled
we
laughed
loud
and
long
then
we
gathered
ourselves
up
and
wondered
if
she
might
be
taking
water
under
the
cargo
it
developed
that
she
was
but
one
of
our
grub
boxes
containing
all
the
bacon
was
missing
so
were
the
short
oars
that
we
used
for
paddles
while
we
laughed
these
had
found
some
convenient
we
had
struck
a
smooth
bowlder
and
leaped
over
it
a
boat
with
the
ordinary
launch
construction
would
have
opened
at
every
seam
the
light
springy
tough
construction
of
the
had
saved
her
whereat
i
thought
of
the
information
bureau
and
was
well
pleased
altogether
we
looked
upon
the
incident
as
a
purple
spot
but
we
were
many
miles
from
available
bacon
and
when
upon
trial
the
engine
refused
to
make
a
revolution
we
began
to
get
exceedingly
hungry
for
meat
having
a
dead
engine
and
no
paddles
we
drifted
we
drifted
very
slowly
the
kid
asked
if
he
might
not
go
ashore
and
drive
a
stake
in
the
bank
for
what
purpose
why
to
ascertain
whether
we
were
going
up
or
down
stream
while
we
drifted
in
the
now
blistering
sun
we
talked
about
with
a
devilish
persistence
we
quite
exhausted
the
subject
we
discussed
the
best
methods
for
making
a
beefsteak
delicious
it
made
us
very
hungry
for
meat
the
kid
announced
that
he
could
feel
his
backbone
sawing
at
the
front
of
his
shirt
but
perhaps
that
was
only
the
hyperbole
of
youth
bill
confessed
that
he
had
once
grumbled
at
his
good
wife
for
serving
the
steak
too
rare
he
now
stated
that
at
the
first
telegraph
station
he
would
wire
for
forgiveness
i
advised
him
to
wire
for
money
instead
and
buy
meat
with
it
personally
i
felt
a
sort
of
wistful
tenderness
for
that
day
passed
somehow
and
the
next
morning
we
were
still
hungry
for
meat
we
spent
most
of
the
morning
talking
about
it
in
the
blistering
windless
afternoon
we
drifted
lazily
now
and
then
we
took
turns
cranking
the
engine
we
were
going
stern
foremost
and
i
was
cranking
we
rounded
a
bend
where
the
wall
rocks
sloped
back
leaving
a
narrow
arid
sagebrush
strip
along
both
sides
of
the
stream
i
had
straightened
up
to
get
the
kink
out
of
my
back
and
mop
the
sweat
out
of
my
eyes
when
i
saw
something
that
made
my
stomach
turn
a
double
somersault
a
good
eight
hundred
yards
down
stream
at
the
point
of
a
something
that
looked
like
and
yet
unlike
a
small
cluster
of
drifting
leafless
brush
moved
slowly
into
the
water
now
it
appeared
quite
distinct
and
now
it
seemed
that
a
film
of
oil
all
but
blotted
it
out
i
blinked
my
eyes
and
peered
hard
through
the
baffling
yellow
glare
then
i
reached
for
the
rifle
and
climbed
over
the
gunwhale
i
smelled
raw
meat
fortunately
we
were
drifting
across
a
bar
and
the
slow
water
came
only
to
my
shoulders
the
thing
eight
hundred
yards
away
was
forging
across
stream
by
this
time
heading
for
the
mouth
of
a
coulee
i
saw
plainly
now
that
the
brush
grew
out
of
a
head
it
was
a
buck
with
antlers
just
below
the
coulee
mouth
the
wall
rocks
began
again
the
buck
would
be
obliged
to
land
above
the
wall
rocks
and
the
drifting
boat
would
keep
him
going
i
reached
shore
and
headed
for
that
coulee
the
sagebrush
concealed
me
at
the
critical
moment
i
intended
to
show
myself
and
start
him
up
the
steep
slope
thus
he
would
be
forced
to
approach
me
while
fleeing
me
when
i
felt
that
enough
time
had
passed
i
stood
up
the
buck
shaking
himself
like
a
dog
stood
against
the
yellow
sandstone
at
the
mouth
of
the
gulch
he
saw
me
looked
back
at
the
drifting
boat
and
appeared
to
be
undecided
i
wondered
what
the
range
might
be
back
home
in
the
plowed
field
where
i
frequently
plug
tin
cans
at
various
long
ranges
i
would
have
called
it
six
hundred
yards
at
first
then
suddenly
it
seemed
three
or
four
hundred
like
a
thing
in
a
dream
the
buck
seemed
to
waver
back
and
forth
in
the
oily
sunlight
call
it
four
hundred
and
fifty
i
said
to
myself
and
let
drive
a
spurt
of
yellow
leaped
from
the
cliff
a
foot
or
so
above
the
deer
back
only
four
hundred
but
the
deer
had
made
up
his
mind
he
had
urgent
business
on
the
other
side
of
that
slope
he
appeared
to
be
overdue
illustration
fresh
meat
illustration
supper
i
pumped
up
another
shell
and
drew
fine
at
four
hundred
that
time
his
rump
quivered
for
a
second
as
though
a
great
weight
had
been
dropped
on
it
but
he
went
on
with
increased
speed
once
more
i
let
him
have
it
that
time
he
lost
an
antler
he
had
now
reached
the
summit
two
hundred
feet
up
at
the
least
he
hesitated
seemed
to
be
shivering
i
have
hunted
with
a
full
stomach
and
brought
down
game
but
there
a
difference
when
you
are
empty
in
that
moment
before
you
kill
you
became
the
sort
of
fellow
your
mother
would
like
perhaps
the
average
man
would
feel
a
little
ashamed
to
tell
the
truth
about
that
savage
moment
i
got
down
on
my
knee
and
put
a
final
ball
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
the
buck
reared
stiffened
and
came
down
tumbling
over
and
over
that
night
we
pitched
camp
under
a
lone
scrubby
tree
at
the
mouth
of
an
arid
gulch
that
led
back
into
the
utterly
bad
lands
it
was
the
wilderness
indeed
coyotes
howled
far
away
in
the
night
and
diving
beaver
boomed
out
in
the
black
stream
we
built
half
a
dozen
fires
and
swung
above
them
the
choice
portions
of
our
kill
and
how
we
ate
with
what
glorious
appetites
it
is
good
to
sit
with
a
company
flinging
words
of
joyful
banter
across
very
tall
steins
it
is
good
to
draw
up
to
a
country
table
at
christmas
time
with
turkey
and
and
puddings
before
you
and
the
ones
you
love
about
you
i
have
been
deeply
happy
with
apples
and
cider
before
an
open
fireplace
i
have
been
present
when
the
brilliant
of
wit
flashed
across
a
banquet
table
and
it
thrilled
me
there
is
no
feast
like
the
feast
in
the
open
the
feast
in
the
flaring
light
of
a
night
fire
the
feast
of
your
own
kill
with
the
tang
of
the
wild
and
the
tang
of
the
smoke
in
it
chapter
vi
getting
down
to
business
it
all
came
back
there
by
the
smoldering
fires
the
wonder
and
the
beauty
and
the
awe
of
being
alive
we
had
eaten
hugely
a
giant
feast
there
had
been
no
formalities
about
that
meal
lying
on
our
blankets
under
the
we
had
cut
with
our
the
tender
morsels
from
a
haunch
as
it
roasted
when
the
haunch
was
at
last
cooked
to
the
bone
only
the
bone
was
left
heavy
with
the
feast
i
lay
on
my
back
watching
the
gray
smoke
brush
my
stars
that
seemed
so
near
stars
soft
and
gentle
and
mystical
like
a
yotun
woman
wooing
the
latent
giant
in
me
the
night
pressed
down
i
closed
my
eyes
and
through
me
ran
the
sensuous
surface
fires
of
her
limbs
upon
my
face
the
weird
magnetic
lure
of
lips
made
soundless
music
like
a
sister
like
a
mother
she
caressed
me
lazy
with
the
huge
feast
and
yet
a
drowsy
joy
shimmered
and
rippled
in
my
veins
drowsing
and
dreaming
under
the
drifting
i
felt
the
sense
of
time
and
self
drop
away
from
me
no
now
no
no
yesterday
no
i
only
eternity
one
vast
whole
changeless
and
in
it
all
one
spot
of
consciousness
more
acute
than
other
spots
and
that
was
the
something
that
had
eaten
hugely
and
that
now
felt
the
glory
of
it
all
the
swooning
sense
of
awe
and
wonder
the
rippling
shimmering
universal
joy
and
then
suddenly
and
without
shock
like
the
shifting
of
the
wood
smoke
the
mood
veered
and
there
was
nothing
but
i
space
and
eternity
were
i
vast
projections
of
myself
tingling
with
my
consciousness
to
the
remotest
fringe
of
the
outward
swinging
through
immeasurable
night
pierced
capriciously
with
shafts
of
paradoxic
day
through
and
beyond
the
awful
circle
of
yearless
duration
my
ego
lived
and
knew
itself
and
thrilled
with
the
glory
of
being
the
slowly
revolving
milky
way
was
only
a
glory
within
me
the
great
jeweling
the
summit
of
a
cliff
was
only
an
ecstasy
within
me
the
murmuring
of
the
river
out
in
the
dark
was
only
the
singing
of
my
heart
and
the
deep
deep
blue
of
the
heavens
was
only
the
splendid
color
of
my
soul
bill
snored
among
the
glowing
fires
moved
the
black
bulk
of
the
kid
turning
the
hunks
of
venison
and
then
the
universe
and
i
curiously
mixed
swooned
into
nothing
at
all
and
i
was
blinking
at
a
golden
glow
and
from
the
river
came
a
shouting
it
was
broad
day
we
leaped
up
and
rubbing
the
sleep
from
our
eyes
saw
a
light
skiff
drifting
toward
us
it
contained
two
men
frank
and
charley
we
had
met
them
at
benton
and
during
an
acquaintance
of
three
weeks
we
had
learned
of
their
remarkable
ability
as
cooks
frank
was
a
little
canadian
frenchman
and
charley
was
english
both
in
the
parlance
of
the
road
were
floaters
that
is
to
say
no
locality
ever
knew
them
long
the
earth
was
their
floor
the
sky
their
ceiling
and
their
god
was
whim
naturally
our
trip
had
appealed
to
them
and
one
month
in
benton
had
aggravated
that
hopelessly
incurable
disease
so
we
had
agreed
that
somewhere
down
river
we
would
camp
for
a
week
and
wait
for
them
they
would
do
the
cooking
and
we
would
take
them
in
tow
two
days
after
we
dropped
out
of
benton
they
had
abruptly
jumped
an
unfinished
job
and
put
off
after
us
in
a
skiff
rowing
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
in
order
to
overtake
us
certainly
they
had
arrived
at
the
moment
most
psychologically
favorable
for
the
beginning
of
an
odd
sort
of
tyranny
that
followed
cooking
is
a
weird
mystery
to
me
as
for
bill
and
the
kid
courtesy
forbids
detailed
comment
the
kid
had
been
uniformly
successful
in
disguising
the
most
familiar
articles
of
diet
and
bill
was
perhaps
least
unsuccessful
in
the
making
of
flapjacks
according
to
his
naÃ¯ve
statement
he
had
discovered
the
trick
of
mixing
the
batter
while
manufacturing
photographer
mounting
paste
his
statement
was
never
questioned
my
only
criticism
on
his
flapjacks
was
simply
that
he
left
too
much
to
the
imagination
for
these
and
kindred
reasons
we
gladly
hailed
the
newcomers
ten
minutes
after
the
skiff
touched
shore
the
camp
consisted
of
two
cooks
and
three
scullions
the
kid
was
a
hewer
and
packer
of
wood
i
was
a
peeler
and
slicer
of
things
and
bill
sweetly
oblivious
of
his
bewhiskered
dignity
danced
about
in
the
humblest
of
moods
handing
this
and
that
to
the
you
outfitted
like
greenhorns
announced
the
usurpers
what
you
want
is
raw
material
run
down
to
the
boat
please
and
bring
me
this
oh
yes
and
bring
me
that
and
you
find
the
other
in
the
bottom
of
the
skiff
forward
locker
put
a
little
more
wood
on
the
fire
kid
and
say
bill
hand
me
that
wo
you
who
going
to
get
a
pail
of
water
all
three
of
us
were
going
to
get
a
pail
of
water
of
course
it
was
the
one
thing
in
the
world
we
wanted
to
do
very
much
get
a
pail
of
water
but
the
raw
materials
how
they
played
on
them
i
regarded
their
performance
as
a
species
of
duet
and
the
raw
materials
ranged
in
the
sand
about
the
fire
were
the
keys
frank
touched
this
charley
touched
that
and
over
the
fire
the
music
grew
perfectly
we
had
bought
with
much
care
all
or
nearly
all
the
ordinary
these
the
usurpers
scorned
three
or
four
gasoline
cans
transformed
by
a
into
skillets
ovens
platters
sufficed
for
these
masters
of
their
craft
the
downright
greek
simplicity
of
their
methods
won
me
completely
this
is
indeed
art
thought
i
first
the
elimination
of
the
and
then
the
virile
unerring
directness
the
seemingly
easy
accomplishment
resulting
from
effort
long
forgotten
and
above
all
the
final
convincing
delivery
of
the
goods
out
of
the
chaos
of
the
raw
material
beneath
the
touch
of
wise
hands
emerged
a
wondrous
cosmos
of
biscuits
light
as
the
heart
of
a
boy
and
frank
singing
a
french
ditty
created
wheat
cakes
his
method
struck
me
as
poetic
he
scorned
the
ordinary
uninspired
manner
of
turning
the
cake
one
side
being
done
he
waited
until
the
ditty
reached
a
certain
lilting
upward
leap
in
the
refrain
when
with
a
dexterous
movement
of
the
he
tossed
the
cake
into
the
air
making
it
execute
a
joyful
somersault
and
catching
it
with
a
sizzling
in
the
pan
just
as
the
lilting
measure
ceased
abruptly
why
i
could
taste
that
song
in
the
pancakes
i
wonder
why
domestic
economy
has
so
persistently
overlooked
the
value
of
song
as
an
adjunct
to
cookery
Ã 
la
chansonnette
who
would
eat
them
for
breakfast
at
six
in
the
evening
we
put
off
charley
the
kid
and
i
manning
the
power
boat
bill
and
frank
the
skiff
which
was
towed
by
a
line
i
had
during
the
day
transformed
my
unquestioned
slavery
into
a
distinct
advantage
having
carefully
impressed
upon
the
englishman
the
honor
i
would
do
him
by
allowing
him
to
become
chief
engineer
of
the
i
carefully
avoided
the
subject
of
cranking
i
was
tired
cranking
i
felt
that
i
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
enjoyment
in
that
particular
form
of
physical
exercise
it
had
developed
during
the
day
that
charley
had
once
run
a
gasoline
engine
i
was
careful
to
emphasize
my
ridiculous
lack
of
mechanical
ability
charley
took
the
bait
beautifully
but
just
now
the
engine
ran
merrily
above
its
barking
i
sang
the
praises
of
the
englishman
with
a
comfortable
feeling
that
at
least
in
this
the
tail
would
wag
the
dog
through
the
clear
quiet
waters
between
soaring
canyon
walls
we
raced
eastward
into
the
creeping
twilight
here
and
there
the
banks
widened
out
into
valleys
of
wondrous
beauty
flanked
by
jagged
miniature
mountains
transfigured
in
the
slant
evening
light
it
seemed
the
fÃ¦rie
land
forlorn
of
which
keats
dreamed
where
year
after
year
come
only
the
winds
and
the
rains
and
the
snow
and
the
sunlight
and
the
and
the
in
the
deepening
evening
our
widening
wake
glowed
with
opalescent
watching
the
oily
ripples
i
steered
wild
and
lost
the
channel
we
all
got
out
and
wading
in
different
directions
went
hunting
for
the
missouri
river
it
had
flattened
out
into
a
lake
three
or
four
hundred
yards
wide
and
eight
inches
deep
slipping
poles
under
the
power
boat
we
carried
it
several
hundred
yards
to
a
point
where
the
stream
deepened
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
the
engine
quit
work
for
the
day
the
skiff
towed
us
another
mile
or
so
to
a
camping
place
having
moored
the
boats
we
lined
up
on
the
shore
and
had
a
song
it
was
a
quintet
consisting
of
a
frenchman
an
englishman
an
irishman
a
cornishman
and
a
german
a
very
strong
quintet
it
was
that
is
to
say
strong
on
volume
as
to
quality
we
were
thrusting
ourselves
upon
an
audience
the
river
and
the
sky
did
seem
to
mind
and
the
cliffs
sang
after
us
lagging
a
beat
or
two
we
wished
to
sing
ever
so
beautifully
and
after
all
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
the
whole
world
wishing
to
sing
melodiously
than
to
have
just
a
few
masters
here
and
there
who
really
can
did
you
ever
hear
a
barefooted
plowboy
singing
powerfully
and
quite
out
of
tune
the
stubble
fields
about
him
still
glistening
with
the
morning
dew
and
the
meadow
larks
joining
in
from
the
i
have
and
soaring
above
the
faulty
execution
i
heard
the
of
the
world
wooing
the
eternal
dawn
true
song
is
merely
a
hopeful
condition
of
the
soul
and
so
i
am
sure
we
sang
very
wonderfully
that
night
and
how
the
flapjacks
disappeared
as
a
result
of
that
singing
we
ate
until
charley
refused
to
bake
any
more
then
we
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
by
the
fire
and
swapped
lies
dropping
off
one
at
a
time
into
sleep
until
the
last
speaker
finished
his
story
with
only
the
drowsy
stars
for
an
audience
at
least
i
suppose
it
was
so
i
was
not
the
last
speaker
alas
too
seldom
were
we
to
hail
the
evening
star
with
song
so
far
we
had
made
in
a
week
little
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
with
the
exception
of
a
few
hours
of
head
winds
that
week
had
been
a
week
of
dream
we
now
awoke
fully
to
the
fact
that
in
low
water
season
the
missouri
is
not
swift
in
our
early
plans
we
had
fallen
in
with
the
popular
fallacy
that
one
need
only
cut
loose
and
let
the
current
do
the
rest
whereas
in
low
water
one
would
probably
never
reach
the
end
of
his
journey
by
that
method
in
addition
to
this
our
gasoline
was
running
low
we
had
trusted
to
irrigation
plants
for
replenishing
our
supply
from
time
to
time
but
the
great
flood
of
the
spring
had
swept
the
valley
clean
where
the
year
before
there
were
prosperous
ranch
establishments
with
gasoline
pumping
plants
there
was
only
desolation
now
it
was
as
though
we
traveled
in
the
path
of
a
devastating
army
perhaps
the
summer
of
was
the
most
unfavorable
season
for
such
a
trip
in
the
last
fifty
years
steamboating
on
the
upper
river
is
only
a
memory
there
are
now
no
as
formerly
we
found
ourselves
with
no
certainty
of
procuring
grub
and
oil
our
engine
became
more
and
more
untrustworthy
our
paddles
had
been
lost
what
winds
we
had
generally
blew
against
us
and
the
character
of
the
banks
was
changing
the
cliffs
gave
way
to
broad
alluvial
valleys
over
which
at
times
the
gales
swept
with
terrific
force
our
map
told
us
of
a
number
of
river
towns
we
had
already
been
partially
disillusioned
as
to
the
character
of
those
towns
they
were
pretty
much
in
a
class
with
goodale
except
that
they
lacked
the
switch
and
the
and
the
sign
just
now
rocky
point
lay
ahead
of
us
rocky
point
meant
a
new
supply
of
food
and
oil
stimulated
by
this
thought
charley
cranked
heroically
under
the
blistering
sun
and
managed
to
arouse
the
engine
now
and
then
into
spasms
of
speed
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
swear
fearfully
i
awaited
the
first
evidence
of
the
new
mood
which
i
knew
must
come
at
least
once
a
day
we
put
the
machinery
on
the
operating
table
each
time
we
succeeded
only
in
developing
new
symptoms
at
a
point
about
fifty
miles
from
the
town
so
deeply
longed
for
a
lone
appeared
on
the
bank
how
far
to
rocky
point
i
cried
oh
something
less
than
two
hundred
miles
drawled
the
horseman
how
carelessly
they
juggle
with
miles
in
that
country
it
just
a
little
place
is
it
i
continued
little
place
answered
the
hell
no
what
i
cried
in
glee
is
it
really
a
town
of
importance
i
had
visions
of
a
budding
metropolis
full
of
gasoline
and
grub
i
guess
it
ai
a
little
place
explained
the
rider
got
nigh
onto
ten
thousand
cattle
down
ten
minutes
after
that
charley
after
a
desperate
but
unsuccessful
fit
of
cranking
straightened
the
kink
out
of
his
back
mopped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
almost
immediately
i
felt
or
at
least
thought
i
felt
a
distinct
change
in
the
temper
of
the
crew
for
the
worse
we
used
the
better
part
of
two
days
covering
the
last
fifty
miles
into
rocky
point
only
to
find
that
the
place
consisted
of
a
log
two
women
an
old
man
and
texas
the
cattle
and
the
other
men
were
scattered
over
a
hundred
miles
or
so
of
range
the
women
either
would
not
or
could
not
supply
us
with
grub
explaining
that
the
nearest
railroad
town
was
ninety
miles
away
gasoline
was
out
of
the
question
we
might
be
able
to
buy
some
at
the
mouth
of
milk
river
hundred
miles
down
texas
who
made
me
think
of
gargantua
and
who
had
a
chest
like
a
bison
bull
and
a
drawling
voice
ran
a
saloon
in
an
odd
little
shanty
boat
brought
down
by
the
flood
he
solved
the
problem
for
us
you
cai
get
no
gasoline
short
o
milk
river
he
bellowed
drawlingly
and
you
sure
got
to
paddle
so
you
better
buy
whisky
while
we
were
deciding
to
accept
the
offered
advice
texas
whittled
a
stick
and
got
off
a
few
jokes
of
rabelaisian
directness
we
laughed
heartily
and
as
a
mark
of
his
appreciation
he
gave
us
five
quarts
for
a
gallon
which
proved
in
spite
of
his
appearance
that
texas
was
very
human
we
gave
the
engine
a
final
trial
it
ran
by
spasms
backwards
then
finally
it
refused
to
run
at
all
we
tried
to
make
ourselves
believe
that
the
gasoline
was
too
low
in
the
tank
that
the
pressure
of
the
oil
had
something
to
do
with
it
at
first
we
really
knew
better
but
days
of
drudgery
at
the
paddles
transformed
the
makeshift
hope
into
something
almost
like
a
certainty
there
was
no
lumber
at
rocky
point
we
rummaged
through
a
pile
of
driftwood
and
found
some
these
we
hacked
into
paddles
they
weighed
when
thoroughly
soaked
at
least
fifteen
pounds
apiece
sending
bill
and
frank
on
ahead
with
the
skiff
and
the
small
store
of
provisions
charley
and
i
the
kid
at
the
steering
rope
set
out
pushing
the
power
canoe
with
the
paddles
the
skiff
was
very
soon
out
of
sight
the
very
fast
under
power
was
with
paddles
the
slowest
boat
imaginable
there
was
no
lift
to
her
prow
no
exhilarating
leap
as
with
the
typical
light
canoe
driven
by
regulation
paddles
and
she
was
as
unwieldy
as
a
log
a
light
wind
blew
and
the
current
was
very
slow
after
dark
we
caught
up
with
bill
and
frank
who
had
supper
waiting
i
had
been
tasting
venison
all
day
but
there
was
none
for
supper
in
spite
of
a
night
smoking
all
of
it
had
spoiled
this
left
us
without
meat
our
provisions
now
consisted
mostly
of
flour
we
had
a
few
potatoes
and
some
toasted
wind
called
breakfast
food
during
six
or
seven
hours
of
hard
work
at
the
paddles
we
had
covered
no
more
than
fifteen
miles
these
facts
put
together
gave
no
promising
result
in
addition
to
this
it
was
impossible
to
stir
up
a
song
even
the
liquor
would
bring
it
out
and
the
flapjacks
were
not
served
la
that
night
i
tried
to
explain
why
the
trip
was
only
beginning
to
get
interesting
but
my
words
fell
flat
and
when
the
irrepressible
kid
essayed
a
joke
i
alone
laughed
at
it
though
rather
out
of
gratitude
than
mirth

undisputed
reputation

your

this

it

being

so
much
of
it
i

it
stands
firmly

it
gains

grows

worship
it

thrill

the
joy
of
girded

to
go
on
forever
and
fail
and
go
on
again
with
the
half
of
a
broken
hope
for
a
pillow
at
night
thus
it
should
have
been
but
that
night
staring
into
the
face
of
three
of
the
four
i
saw
the
yellow
streak
the
kid
was
not
one
of
the
three
the
first
railroad
station
would
hold
out
no
temptation
to
him
he
was
a
kid
but
manhood
has
little
to
do
with
age
it
must
exist
from
the
first
like
a
tang
of
iron
in
the
blood
age
does
not
really
create
anything
it
only
develops
your
wonderful
and
beautiful
things
often
come
as
paradoxes
i
looked
for
a
man
and
found
him
in
a
boy
bill
talked
about
home
and
stared
into
the
twilight
the
floaters
were
irritable
quarreling
with
the
fire
the
grub
the
and
verbally
sending
the
engine
to
the
devil
seeing
about
eighteen
hundred
miles
of
paddle
work
ahead
knowing
that
at
that
season
of
the
year
the
prevailing
winds
would
be
head
winds
and
having
very
little
faith
in
the
engine
under
any
conditions
i
decided
to
travel
day
and
night
for
the
water
was
falling
steadily
and
already
the
channels
were
at
times
hard
to
find
charley
and
frank
grumbled
i
told
them
we
would
split
the
grub
fairly
a
fifth
to
a
man
and
that
they
might
travel
as
slowly
as
they
liked
the
skiff
being
their
property
they
stayed
with
us
we
lashed
the
boats
together
and
put
off
into
the
slow
current
a
haggard
eerie
fragment
of
moon
slinked
westward
stars
glinted
in
the
flawless
chilly
blue
the
surface
of
the
river
was
like
polished
ebony
a
wrought
of
gloom
and
gleam
the
banks
were
lines
of
dusk
except
where
some
lone
cottonwood
loomed
skyward
like
a
giant
ghost
clothed
with
a
mantle
that
glistered
and
darkled
in
the
chill
there
was
the
feel
of
moving
in
eternity
about
it
all
the
very
limitation
of
the
dusk
gave
the
feeling
of
immensity
there
was
no
sense
of
motion
yet
we
moved
the
sky
seemed
as
much
below
as
above
we
seemed
suspended
in
a
hollow
globe
now
and
then
the
boom
of
a
diving
beaver
tail
accented
the
clinging
quiet
and
by
fits
the
drowsy
muttering
of
waterfowl
awoke
in
the
adjacent
swamps
and
droned
back
into
the
universal
hush
frank
and
i
stood
watch
the
three
others
rolling
up
in
their
blankets
among
the
luggage
it
occurred
to
me
for
the
first
time
that
we
had
a
phonograph
under
the
cargo
i
went
down
after
it
at
random
i
chose
a
record
and
set
the
machine
going
it
was
a
chopin
played
on
a
a
vocal
yearning
a
wailing
of
frustrate
aspirations
a
brushing
of
sick
wings
across
the
gates
of
heavens
never
to
be
entered
and
then
the
finale
an
insistent
feverish
repetition
of
the
human
ache
ceasing
as
with
utter
exhaustion
i
looked
about
me
drinking
in
the
night
how
little
this
music
really
expressed
it
it
seemed
too
humanly
too
egotistic
too
petty
to
sound
out
under
those
stars
in
that
divine
quiet
i
slipped
on
another
record
this
time
it
was
a
beautiful
little
song
full
of
the
sweet
melancholy
of
love
i
shut
it
down
the
thing
do
in
the
evening
yes
but
truly
there
is
something
womanly
about
night
something
loverlike
in
a
vast
impersonal
way
but
too
big
she
is
too
terribly
big
to
woo
with
human
sentiment
only
a
windlike
chant
would
do
something
with
an
undertone
of
human
despair
outsoared
by
brave
savage
flights
of
invincible
great
virile
singing
winged
as
the
starlight
weird
as
space
whitman
sublimated
david
soul
poured
out
in
symphony
i
started
another
going
this
time
i
did
not
stop
it
for
the
night
was
singing
through
its
nose
perhaps
but
still
it
was
singing
out
of
that
machine
it
was
wagner
played
by
an
orchestra
it
filled
the
night
swept
the
glittering
reaches
groped
about
in
the
glooms
and
then
leaving
the
human
theme
behind
the
upward
yearning
violins
took
flight
dissolving
at
last
into
starlight
and
immensity
ages
swept
by
me
like
a
when
i
got
back
the
machine
all
but
run
down
was
scratching
hideously
slowly
we
swung
about
in
the
scarcely
perceptible
current
down
among
the
luggage
the
three
snored
discordantly
frank
cigarette
glowed
intermittently
against
the
dim
horizon
like
a
bonfire
far
off
somewhere
out
in
the
gloom
coyotes
chattered
and
yelped
and
from
far
across
the
dusky
valley
others
answered
a
doleful
tenson
i
dozed
frank
awoke
us
all
with
a
shout
we
leaped
up
and
stared
blinkingly
into
the
north
that
whole
region
of
the
sky
was
aflame
from
zenith
to
horizon
with
spectral
fires
it
was
the
aurora
not
the
pale
ragged
glow
sputtering
like
the
ghost
of
a
huge
which
is
familiar
to
every
one
but
a
billowing
of
color
rainbows
gone
mad
in
the
northeast
the
long
rolling
columns
formed
clouds
of
spectral
light
whipped
up
as
by
a
whirlwind
flung
from
eastward
to
westward
devouring
polaris
and
the
wain
rapid
sequent
towers
of
smokeless
fire
it
dazzled
and
whirled
and
mounted
and
fell
like
the
illumined
filmy
skirts
of
some
invisible
titanic
serpentine
dancer
madly
pirouetting
across
a
carpet
of
stars
then
suddenly
it
all
fell
into
a
dull
and
flashed
out
the
ragged
moon
dropped
out
of
the
southwestern
sky
in
the
chill
of
the
night
gray
dense
fog
wraiths
crawled
upon
the
hidden
face
of
the
waters
again
i
dozed
and
awakened
with
the
sense
of
having
stopped
suddenly
a
light
wind
had
arisen
and
we
were
fast
on
a
bar
frank
and
i
took
our
blankets
out
on
the
sand
rolled
up
and
went
to
sleep
the
red
of
dawn
awoke
us
as
though
some
one
had
shouted
frank
and
i
sat
up
and
stared
about
a
deer
was
drinking
at
the
river
edge
three
hundred
yards
away
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
it
was
a
we
blinked
complacently
at
it
until
it
disappeared
in
the
brush
then
we
thought
of
the
rifle
we
were
all
stiff
and
chilled
the
boats
were
motionless
in
shallow
water
we
all
got
out
in
the
stream
that
felt
icy
to
us
and
waded
the
crafts
into
the
channel
incidentally
we
remembered
texas
and
his
wisdom
the
time
was
early
august
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
tang
of
frost
in
the
air
and
the
river
seemed
to
flow
not
water
but
a
thick
frore
fog
i
smelled
persimmons
distinctly
it
was
that
cold
brown
spicy
persimmons
smashed
on
crisp
autumn
leaves
down
in
old
missouri
the
smell
haunted
me
all
morning
like
a
regret
we
breakfasted
on
flapjacks
and
separating
the
boats
put
off
the
skiff
left
us
easily
and
disappeared
a
head
wind
arose
with
the
sun
and
increased
steadily
by
eleven
it
blew
so
strongly
that
we
could
make
no
headway
with
the
rude
paddles
and
the
waves
rolling
at
least
four
feet
from
trough
to
crest
made
it
impossible
to
hold
the
boat
in
course
we
quit
paddling
and
got
out
in
the
water
with
the
line
two
pulled
and
one
pushed
all
day
we
waded
sometimes
up
to
our
necks
sometimes
we
swam
a
bit
and
sometimes
we
clung
to
the
boat
and
kicked
it
on
to
the
next
shallows
our
progress
was
ridiculously
slow
but
we
kept
moving
when
we
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
to
smoke
under
the
lee
of
a
bank
our
legs
cramped
to
lay
up
one
day
would
be
only
to
establish
a
precedent
for
day
after
day
of
inactivity
the
prevailing
winds
would
be
head
winds
we
clung
to
the
shoddy
hope
held
out
by
that
magic
name
milk
river
we
knew
too
well
that
milk
river
was
only
a
snare
and
a
delusion
but
one
must
fight
toward
something
it
makes
little
difference
what
you
call
that
something
a
goal
in
itself
is
an
empty
thing
all
the
virtue
lies
in
the
moving
toward
the
goal
often
we
sank
deep
in
the
mud
often
at
the
bends
we
could
scarcely
forge
against
the
blast
that
held
us
leaning
to
the
pull
noon
came
and
still
we
had
not
overtaken
the
skiff
dark
came
and
we
had
not
yet
sighted
it
but
with
the
sun
the
wind
fell
and
we
paddled
on
lank
and
chilled
about
ten
we
sighted
the
campfire
we
ate
flapjacks
once
more
delicious
butterless
flapjacks
and
then
once
more
we
put
off
into
the
chill
night
we
made
twelve
miles
that
day
and
every
foot
had
been
a
fight
i
wanted
to
raise
it
to
before
sunrise
no
one
grumbled
this
time
but
in
the
light
of
the
campfire
the
faces
looked
cheerless
except
the
kid
face
we
huddled
up
in
our
blankets
and
naturally
all
of
us
went
to
sleep
a
great
shock
brought
us
to
our
feet
the
moon
had
set
and
the
sky
was
overcast
thick
night
clung
around
us
we
saw
nothing
but
by
the
rocking
of
the
boats
and
the
roaring
of
the
river
we
knew
we
were
shooting
rapids
still
dazed
with
sleep
i
had
a
curious
sense
of
being
whirled
at
a
terrific
speed
into
some
subterranean
suck
of
waters
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
we
struck
rocks
and
went
rolling
shipping
buckets
of
water
at
every
dip
then
there
was
a
long
sickening
swoop
through
utter
blackness
it
ended
abruptly
with
a
thud
that
knocked
us
down
we
found
that
we
were
no
longer
moving
we
got
out
hanging
to
the
gunwales
the
boats
were
lodged
on
a
reef
of
rock
and
we
were
obliged
to
walk
them
for
some
distance
when
suddenly
the
water
deepened
and
we
all
went
up
to
our
necks
and
the
night
seemed
bitterly
cold
i
never
shivered
more
in
january
it
was
yet
too
dark
to
find
a
camping
place
so
we
drifted
on
until
the
east
paled
then
we
built
a
great
log
fire
and
baked
ourselves
until
sunrise
day
after
day
my
begins
with
the
words
heavy
head
winds
and
ends
with
drifted
most
of
the
night
we
covered
about
miles
every
hours
every
day
the
cooks
grumbled
more
and
bill
had
a
way
of
staring
wistfully
into
the
distance
and
talking
about
home
that
produced
in
me
an
odd
mixture
of
anger
and
pity
we
had
lost
our
map
we
had
no
calendar
time
and
distance
curiously
confused
were
merely
a
weariness
in
the
shoulders
chapter
vii
on
to
the
yellowstone
at
last
one
evening
shall
i
confess
it
we
had
soup
for
supper
now
a
flight
of
cranes
across
a
sky
shot
with
threads
of
evening
scarlet
makes
a
masterly
picture
indeed
an
effect
worthy
of
reproduction
in
art
you
see
a
japanese
screen
done
in
heroic
size
and
it
is
a
sight
to
make
you
long
exquisitely
for
things
that
are
not
like
a
poet
but
let
us
have
no
illusions
about
this
matter
crane
soup
is
not
satisfactory
it
looks
and
tastes
and
gives
to
your
psychic
inwardness
a
dull
melancholy
tone
and
when
you
nibble
at
the
boiled
meat
of
an
adult
crane
you
catch
yourself
wondering
just
what
sort
of
could
be
made
out
of
boots
you
have
a
morbid
longing
to
know
just
how
bad
such
a
would
really
be
hereafter
on
whatever
trails
i
may
follow
blue
cranes
shall
be
used
chiefly
for
japanese
screen
effects
little
by
little
the
latent
philosopher
in
me
emerges
to
remark
by
experience
we
place
not
only
ourselves
but
all
things
in
their
proper
places
in
the
universe
this
process
of
fitting
things
properly
in
one
cosmos
seems
to
be
one
of
the
chief
aims
of
conscious
life
therefore
i
score
one
for
myself
having
placed
blue
cranes
permanently
in
that
cosmic
nook
given
over
to
japanese
screen
effects
next
morning
we
pushed
on
the
taste
of
that
crane
soup
clung
to
me
all
day
like
the
memory
of
an
old
sorrow
dulled
by
time
deer
tracks
were
plentiful
but
it
has
long
been
conceded
that
the
tracks
are
by
far
the
least
edible
things
pertaining
to
an
animal
cranes
seemed
to
have
multiplied
rapidly
impudently
tame
they
lined
the
and
regarded
us
curiously
as
we
fought
our
way
past
them
now
and
then
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
alighted
several
hundred
yards
from
us
we
had
only
a
rifle
to
shoot
a
moving
duck
out
of
a
moving
boat
with
a
rifle
is
a
feat
attended
with
some
difficulties
once
we
wounded
a
wild
goose
but
it
got
away
which
offended
our
sense
of
poetic
justice
after
crane
soup
one
would
seem
to
deserve
roast
goose
i
scanned
the
dreary
monotonous
valleys
stretching
away
from
the
river
we
had
for
several
days
been
living
on
scenery
tobacco
and
flapjacks
the
scenery
had
flattened
out
tobacco
was
running
low
but
the
flapjacks
bid
fair
to
go
on
forever
i
sought
in
my
head
for
the
exact
adjective
the
particular
epithet
with
the
inevitable
feel
about
it
with
which
to
describe
that
monotonous
melancholy
stretch
every
time
i
tried
i
came
back
to
the
word
the
word
took
on
exquisite
overtones
of
gray
meaning
and
i
worked
up
those
overtones
until
i
had
a
perfectly
wrought
melancholy
poem
of
one
word
for
after
all
a
poem
never
existed
upon
paper
but
lives
subtly
in
the
consciousness
of
the
poet
and
in
the
minds
of
those
who
understand
the
poet
through
the
suggestiveness
of
his
written
symbols
and
their
own
remembered
experiences
but
during
the
next
morning
poetic
justice
worked
a
rider
mounted
on
a
piebald
pony
appeared
on
the
bank
and
shouted
for
us
to
pull
in
i
suddenly
realized
why
a
dog
wags
his
tail
at
a
stranger
but
the
feeling
i
had
was
bigger
than
that
this
mounted
man
became
at
once
for
me
the
incarnation
of
the
meaning
of
bacon
when
two
parties
meet
and
each
wants
what
the
other
can
give
it
take
long
to
get
acquainted
the
rider
was
a
youth
of
about
seventeen
one
glance
at
his
face
told
you
the
story
of
his
rearing
he
was
unmistakably
and
his
hands
showed
that
his
life
had
begun
too
easy
for
his
own
good
from
the
east
he
questioned
joyously
say
you
know
little
old
new
york
do
you
when
were
you
there
last
the
lad
was
hungry
but
not
for
bacon
alas
our
hunger
was
the
healthier
one
we
talked
of
new
york
mother
in
paris
he
volunteered
and
dad
in
new
york
meeting
her
bills
but
the
old
got
a
grouch
at
me
and
so
he
sent
me
out
here
in
this
country
say
what
did
they
make
this
country
for
got
any
cigarettes
about
you
how
did
broadway
look
when
you
were
there
last
lights
all
there
yet
at
night
i
been
here
two
years
it
seems
like
two
hundred
talk
about
robinson
crusoe
say
i
got
him
distanced
i
helped
him
build
up
a
momentary
broadway
there
in
the
wilderness
the
lights
the
din
the
hurrying
jostling
theater
crowds
the
cafÃ©s
faces
faces
anguished
faces
eager
faces
weary
faces
painted
faces
squalor
brilliance
for
me
the
memory
of
it
only
made
me
feel
the
pity
of
it
all
but
the
lad
eyes
beamed
he
was
homesick
for
broadway
i
changed
the
subject
from
prose
to
poetry
that
is
from
broadway
to
bacon
wait
here
till
i
come
back
said
the
lad
mounting
he
spurred
up
a
gulch
and
disappeared
in
an
hour
he
reappeared
with
a
half
strip
of
the
precious
stuff
take
money
for
it
not
on
your
life
he
insisted
you
been
down
there
and
that
goes
for
a
meal
ticket
with
me
fried
bacon
and
flapjacks
sopped
in
the
grease
of
it
after
all
a
banquet
is
very
much
a
state
of
mind
when
we
pulled
away
the
ostracized
new
yorker
bade
us
farewell
with
a
snatch
of
a
song
once
more
or
less
popular
give
my
regards
to
broadway
we
pushed
on
vigorously
now
the
head
wind
came
up
head
wind
it
seemed
one
of
the
eternal
things
we
paddled
and
cordelled
valiantly
discussing
milk
river
the
while
we
had
grown
very
credulous
on
that
subject
somehow
or
other
an
unlimited
supply
of
gasoline
was
all
the
engine
needed
for
the
complete
restoration
of
its
health
and
milk
river
stood
for
gasoline
in
liberal
quantities
hope
is
generally
represented
by
the
poets
as
a
thing
winged
and
ethereal
nevertheless
it
can
be
fed
on
bacon
the
next
morning
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
what
we
took
to
be
hell
creek
which
flows
when
it
has
any
water
in
it
out
of
the
bad
lands
it
did
take
much
imagination
to
name
that
creek
the
whole
country
from
which
it
debouches
looks
like
hell
with
the
lights
out
as
general
sully
once
remarked
a
country
of
lifeless
hills
that
had
the
appearance
of
an
endless
succession
of
huge
black
cinder
heaps
from
prehistoric
fires
the
wind
had
increased
steadily
all
day
and
now
we
saw
ahead
of
us
a
long
rolling
stretch
of
river
that
discouraged
us
somewhat
a
gray
mist
rolled
with
the
wind
and
dull
clouds
scudded
over
we
pitched
camp
in
a
clump
of
cottonwoods
and
made
flapjacks
after
which
the
kid
and
i
taking
our
blankets
and
the
rifle
set
out
to
explore
hell
creek
illustration
reveille
illustration
the
pen
and
key
ranch
the
windings
of
the
ravine
soon
hid
us
from
the
river
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
melancholy
world
without
life
and
without
any
human
significance
it
was
very
easy
to
imagine
one
self
lost
amid
the
drear
ashen
craters
of
the
moon
we
pushed
on
up
the
creek
kicking
up
clouds
of
alkali
dust
as
we
went
a
creek
of
a
hell
it
was
to
be
sure
it
seemed
almost
blasphemous
to
call
this
arid
gully
a
creek
boys
swim
in
creeks
and
fishes
twinkle
over
the
shallows
where
the
sweet
eager
waters
make
a
merry
sound
creek
indeed
did
a
cynic
name
this
dry
ragged
gash
in
the
midst
of
a
bleak
black
world
where
nothing
lived
where
never
laughter
sounded
a
seething
fiery
ooze
might
have
flowed
there
once
but
surely
never
did
water
make
music
there
we
pushed
on
five
or
six
miles
and
the
evening
shade
began
to
press
in
about
us
at
last
we
issued
forth
into
a
flat
basin
surrounded
by
the
weird
hills
a
grotesque
amphitheater
admirably
suited
for
a
witches
orgy
some
bleached
bison
heads
with
horns
lay
scattered
about
the
place
and
a
cluster
of
soapweeds
grew
there
god
knows
how
they
thrust
their
sere
yellow
skyward
with
the
pitiful
defiance
of
desperate
things
it
seemed
natural
enough
that
something
should
be
dead
in
this
sepulcher
but
the
living
weeds
fighting
bitterly
for
life
seemed
out
of
place
i
looked
about
and
thought
of
poe
surely
just
beyond
those
summits
where
the
melancholy
sky
touched
the
melancholy
hills
one
would
come
upon
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
and
the
woodland
of
weir
we
gathered
a
quantity
of
the
dry
soapweeds
and
with
one
of
the
blankets
made
a
shelter
against
the
steep
hillside
the
place
was
becoming
eerie
in
the
gray
evening
that
spread
slowly
over
the
dead
land
the
mist
driven
by
the
moaning
wind
became
a
melancholy
drizzle
we
dragged
the
soapweeds
under
cover
and
lit
a
fire
with
difficulty
it
was
a
smudgy
cheerless
fire
and
then
the
night
fell
tremendous
overpowering
night
the
kid
and
i
huddled
close
in
one
blanket
thrust
our
heads
out
from
under
the
shelter
and
watched
the
ghastly
world
leap
by
fits
out
of
the
dark
when
the
sheet
lightning
flared
through
the
drizzle
it
gave
one
an
odd
shivery
feeling
it
was
as
though
one
groped
about
a
strange
dark
room
and
saw
for
a
brief
moment
in
the
spurting
glow
of
a
sulphur
match
the
staring
face
of
a
dead
man
over
us
the
great
wind
groaned
water
dripped
through
the
blanket
like
tears
we
scraped
the
last
damp
ends
of
the
weeds
together
that
the
fire
might
live
a
little
longer
byron
poem
came
back
to
me
with
a
new
force
and
lying
on
my
stomach
in
the
cheerless
drip
before
a
drowning
fire
i
chanted
snatches
of
it
aloud
to
the
kid
and
to
that
sinister
personality
that
was
the
night
i
had
a
dream
which
was
not
all
a
dream
the
bright
sun
was
extinguished
and
the
stars
did
wander
darkling
in
eternal
space
rayless
and
pathless
and
the
icy
earth
swung
blind
and
blackening
in
the
moonless
air
low
thunder
shook
the
night
i
thought
of
it
as
the
spirit
of
byron
applauding
his
own
terrific
lines
a
fearful
hope
was
all
the
world
contained
forests
were
set
on
fire
but
hour
by
hour
they
fell
and
faded
and
the
crackling
trunks
extinguished
with
a
crash
and
all
was
black
out
in
the
darkness
swept
by
spasmodic
deluges
of
rapid
flame
and
muffled
thunder
it
seemed
i
could
hear
the
of
the
moody
master
crackling
and
booming
in
the
gloom
looked
up
with
mad
disquietude
on
the
dull
sky
the
pall
of
a
past
world
say
how
long
is
that
piece
asked
the
kid
and
vipers
crawled
and
twined
themselves
among
the
multitude
hissing
we
wondered
if
there
might
not
be
some
rattlesnakes
in
that
vicinity
they
raked
up
and
shivering
scraped
with
their
cold
skeleton
hands
the
feeble
ashes
and
their
feeble
breath
blew
for
a
little
life
and
made
a
flame
which
was
a
mockery
then
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
as
it
grew
brighter
and
beheld
each
other
aspects
saw
and
shrieked
and
died
cut
that
out
said
the
kid
why
i
asked
because
said
the
kid
but
what
are
bad
lands
for
i
had
hoped
to
chant
a
bit
of
james
thomson
the
younger
also
there
in
that
dreadful
night
i
never
was
in
a
place
where
it
seemed
to
fit
so
well
but
we
huddled
up
in
our
blanket
under
the
dripping
shelter
and
that
was
a
long
night
the
soppy
gray
morning
came
at
length
a
midsummer
morning
after
a
night
of
rain
and
yet
no
bird
no
hopeful
greenery
no
sense
of
the
upward
yearning
when
we
sighted
the
missouri
river
again
the
sun
had
broken
through
upon
the
greengirt
glinting
stream
it
seemed
like
paradise
by
almost
continuous
travel
we
reached
lismus
ferry
on
the
second
morning
from
hell
creek
the
ferryman
had
a
bit
of
information
for
us
we
would
find
nothing
at
the
mouth
of
milk
river
but
a
sandbar
he
advised
us
but
he
had
some
ointment
to
apply
to
the
wound
thus
inflicted
in
that
glasgow
a
town
on
the
great
northern
was
only
miles
inland
the
weekly
stage
had
left
on
the
morning
before
but
the
ferryman
understood
that
the
trail
was
not
overcrowded
with
pedestrians
it
was
a
smarting
ointment
to
apply
to
so
fresh
a
wound
but
we
took
the
medicine
frank
charley
and
i
set
out
at
once
for
glasgow
leaving
the
others
at
camp
to
repair
the
leaking
boat
during
our
absence
the
stage
trail
led
through
an
arid
undulating
prairie
of
yellow
buffalo
grass
there
were
creek
beds
but
they
were
filled
with
dust
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
englishman
set
the
pace
with
the
stride
of
the
the
sun
rose
high
the
dry
runs
reminded
us
unpleasantly
of
our
increasing
thirst
and
the
puffing
wind
blew
hot
as
from
a
distant
prairie
fire
i
followed
at
the
englishman
heels
and
by
and
by
it
began
to
occur
to
me
that
he
could
walk
rather
rapidly
the
frenchman
trailed
after
at
a
steadily
increasing
distance
until
finally
i
could
no
longer
hear
his
forceful
remarks
uttered
in
two
languages
concerning
a
certain
corn
which
he
possessed
we
had
been
cramped
up
in
a
boat
for
several
weeks
and
the
frequent
soakings
in
the
cold
water
had
done
little
good
to
our
joints
none
of
us
was
fit
for
walking
i
kept
back
a
limp
until
the
englishman
ahead
of
me
began
to
step
with
a
little
jerking
of
the
knees
and
then
with
an
almost
vicious
delight
i
gave
over
and
limped
i
never
knew
before
the
great
luxury
of
limping
we
covered
the
distance
in
something
less
than
six
hours
the
next
morning
in
a
drizzling
rain
each
packing
a
can
of
gasoline
and
some
provisions
we
set
out
for
the
ferry
and
it
was
a
sorry
bedraggled
trio
that
limped
up
to
camp
eight
hours
later
we
did
little
more
than
creep
the
last
five
miles
and
all
for
a
spiteful
little
engine
that
might
prove
ungrateful
in
the
end
it
rained
all
night
a
cold
insistent
downpour
our
log
fire
was
drowned
out
the
tent
dripped
steadily
our
blankets
got
soppy
and
three
of
us
were
so
stiff
that
the
least
movement
gave
keen
pain
soppy
dawn
wet
wood
bad
grub
for
breakfast
and
bad
humor
concealed
with
difficulty
but
through
it
all
ran
a
faint
note
of
victory
at
the
thought
of
the
gasoline
and
the
way
that
engine
would
go
we
lay
in
camp
all
day
soppy
sore
waiting
for
the
rain
to
let
up
by
way
of
cheering
up
i
read
and
a
grim
graveyard
substitute
for
cheer
it
was
but
the
next
day
broke
with
a
windy
golden
dawn
we
filled
the
tank
packed
the
luggage
and
lo
the
engine
worked
it
took
all
the
soreness
out
of
our
legs
to
see
it
go
we
rejoiced
now
in
the
heavy
and
steadily
increasing
head
wind
for
it
was
like
conquering
an
old
enemy
to
go
crashing
through
the
rolling
water
that
had
for
so
many
days
given
us
pitiless
battle
for
five
or
six
miles
we
plunged
on
down
the
river
there
was
a
distinct
change
in
the
temper
of
the
crew
a
vote
at
that
time
would
have
been
unanimous
for
finishing
at
new
orleans
the
engine
stopped
the
swung
round
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
and
the
rammed
us
trying
to
climb
over
our
gunwale
we
wallowed
in
the
wash
of
a
bar
and
cranked
by
turns
at
the
end
of
an
hour
no
illusions
were
left
us
holding
an
inquest
over
the
engine
we
pronounced
it
dead
in
the
drear
fag
end
of
the
windy
day
soaked
from
much
wading
and
weary
of
paddling
with
little
headway
we
made
camp
in
a
clump
of
scarlet
bushes
and
by
the
evening
fire
two
talked
of
railroad
stations
one
talked
of
home
and
i
thought
of
that
one
of
the
soldiers
three
who
swore
quietly
into
the
sky
the
milk
river
illusion
was
lost
two
hundred
miles
below
was
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
the
first
station
in
the
long
journey
a
few
days
back
we
had
longed
for
gasoline
but
there
was
no
one
to
sell
now
we
had
fifteen
gallons
to
sell
and
there
was
no
one
to
buy
the
hope
without
the
gasoline
was
decidedly
better
than
the
gasoline
without
the
hope
whereat
the
philosopher
in
me
emerges
to
remark
but
who
cares
philosophy
proceeds
backward
and
points
out
errors
of
thought
and
action
chiefly
when
it
has
become
too
late
to
mend
them
but
it
is
possible
to
be
poor
in
the
possession
of
erstwhile
prospective
wealth
and
rich
in
retrospective
poverty
oh
blessed
is
he
who
is
negatively
rich
being
a
bit
stunned
by
the
death
of
the
hope
conceived
in
weariness
we
did
not
put
off
that
night
but
huddled
up
in
our
blankets
close
to
the
log
fire
for
this
midsummer
night
had
in
it
a
tang
of
frost
day
came
cloudy
and
cold
blown
over
the
wilderness
by
a
wind
that
made
the
cottonwoods
above
us
groan
and
pop
the
waves
were
higher
than
we
had
seen
them
before
we
had
little
heart
for
cordelling
and
no
paddling
could
make
headway
against
that
gale
it
was
sunday
everything
was
damp
and
chilly
shivers
ran
up
our
backs
while
we
toasted
our
feet
and
faces
and
the
smoke
had
a
way
of
blowing
in
every
direction
at
once
charley
struggled
with
the
engine
which
now
and
then
made
a
few
revolutions
backwards
by
way
of
leading
him
on
he
heaped
big
curses
upon
it
and
it
replied
periodically
with
snorts
of
rage
bad
blood
developed
and
mutiny
ensued
which
once
gave
promise
of
developments
fortunately
warded
off
before
the
day
was
done
it
was
made
plain
that
the
kid
and
i
would
travel
alone
from
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
for
said
the
kid
with
certain
virile
decorations
of
speech
i
going
with
you
if
we
have
to
buy
skates
the
wind
fell
at
sunset
a
chill
moonless
starry
night
lured
me
and
i
decided
to
travel
the
mutineers
eager
to
reach
a
railroad
as
soon
as
possible
agreed
to
go
the
skiff
led
and
the
followed
with
paddles
a
mile
or
so
below
we
ran
into
shallows
and
grounded
we
waded
far
around
in
the
cold
water
that
chilled
us
to
the
marrow
but
could
find
neither
entrance
nor
outlet
to
the
pocket
in
which
we
found
ourselves
wading
ashore
we
made
a
cheerless
camp
in
the
brush
leaving
the
boats
stuck
in
the
shallows
for
the
first
time
the
division
in
the
camp
was
well
marked
the
kid
and
i
instinctively
made
our
bed
together
under
one
blanket
and
the
others
bunked
apart
we
had
become
the
main
party
of
the
expedition
the
others
were
now
merely
enforced
camp
followers
it
was
funny
in
an
unpleasant
way
in
the
morning
a
sea
of
stiff
fog
hid
our
boats
packing
the
camp
stuff
on
our
backs
we
waded
about
and
found
the
crafts
at
last
after
a
number
of
cheerless
days
and
nights
of
continuous
travel
the
great
open
rolling
prairies
ahead
of
us
indicated
our
approach
toward
the
end
of
the
journey
first
stage
the
country
began
to
look
like
north
dakota
though
we
were
still
nearly
two
hundred
miles
away
the
monotony
of
the
landscape
was
depressing
it
seemed
a
thousand
miles
to
the
sunrise
the
horizon
was
merely
a
blue
haze
and
the
endless
land
was
sere
the
river
ran
for
days
with
a
succession
of
regularly
occurring
bends
to
the
north
and
east
each
headland
shot
out
in
the
same
way
with
it
seemed
the
same
snags
in
the
water
under
it
and
the
same
cottonwoods
growing
on
it
and
opposite
each
headland
was
the
same
stony
bluff
and
in
the
same
way
until
at
last
we
cried
out
against
the
tediousness
of
the
story
wondering
whether
or
not
we
were
continually
passing
the
same
point
and
somehow
slipping
back
to
pass
it
again
but
at
last
we
reached
wolf
point
the
first
town
in
five
hundred
miles
we
had
seen
no
town
since
we
left
benton
an
odd
little
burlesque
of
a
town
it
was
but
walking
up
its
main
street
we
felt
very
metropolitan
after
weeks
on
those
lonesome
river
stretches
five
assiniboine
indian
girls
seemed
to
be
the
only
women
in
the
town
i
coaxed
them
to
stand
for
a
photograph
on
the
incontestable
grounds
that
they
were
by
far
the
prettiest
women
i
had
seen
for
many
days
the
effect
of
my
generous
praise
is
fixed
forever
on
the
pictured
faces
presented
herewith
here
during
the
day
frank
and
charley
disposed
of
their
skiff
and
we
saw
them
no
more
we
pushed
on
with
little
mourning
but
in
a
spirit
of
fairness
let
me
record
that
charley
biscuits
were
marvels
and
that
frank
Ã 
la
were
things
of
beauty
and
therefore
joys
forever

the
days
that
followed
were
long
and
hard
and
half
the
chilly
nights
were
spent
in
drying
ourselves
before
a
roaring
fire
there
were
more
mosquitoes
now
they
began
to
torture
us
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
and
left
off
only
when
the
cold
of
night
came
relieving
us
of
one
discomfort
by
the
substitution
of
another
bill
of
whom
i
had
come
to
think
as
the
expatriated
turnip
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
study
homesickness
at
once
pitiful
and
ludicrous
in
a
man
with
abundant
whiskers
but
he
pulled
strenuously
at
the
forward
paddle
every
stroke
as
he
remarked
often
taking
him
closer
to
home
the
river
had
fallen
alarmingly
and
was
still
falling
several
times
we
were
obliged
to
unload
the
entire
cargo
piling
it
high
in
the
shallow
water
that
we
might
be
able
to
carry
the
empty
boat
to
the
channel
one
evening
we
came
upon
a
typical
montana
ranch
the
pen
and
key
the
residence
barns
sheds
fences
were
built
of
logs
the
great
rolling
country
about
it
was
thickly
dotted
with
horses
and
cattle
the
place
looked
like
home
it
was
a
sight
from
pisgah
a
glimpse
of
a
promised
land
after
the
wilderness
we
pulled
in
intending
to
buy
some
provisions
for
the
last
stage
of
the
journey
to
the
yellowstone
i
went
up
to
the
main
and
was
met
at
the
door
by
one
of
those
blessed
creatures
that
have
mother
written
all
over
them
hers
were
not
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
she
looked
at
me
as
she
must
look
at
one
of
her
sons
when
he
returns
from
an
extended
absence
i
told
at
once
the
purpose
of
my
errand
explaining
briefly
what
we
were
doing
on
the
river
why
yes
certainly
we
could
have
provisions
but
we
going
any
farther
that
night
were
we
the
rancher
appeared
at
this
moment
a
retired
major
of
the
army
who
looked
the
part
and
decided
that
we
would
stay
for
supper
how
many
were
there
in
our
party
three
three
more
plates
he
said
to
the
daughters
of
the
house
busy
about
the
kitchen
let
be
frank
it
really
required
no
persuasion
at
all
to
make
a
guest
of
me
had
i
allowed
myself
adequate
expression
of
my
delight
i
should
have
startled
the
good
mother
by
turning
a
somersault
or
a
series
of
cartwheels
oh
the
smell
of
an
wholesome
meal
in
process
of
development
a
short
while
back
i
sang
the
praises
of
the
feast
in
the
open
the
feast
of
your
own
kill
tanged
with
the
wood
smoke
and
even
here
i
cling
to
the
statement
that
of
all
meals
the
feast
of
wild
meat
in
the
wilderness
takes
precedence
but
the
supper
we
ate
that
evening
takes
close
second
welcome
on
every
face
the
sort
of
welcome
that
the
most
lavish
tips
could
not
buy
and
after
the
dishes
were
cleared
away
they
brought
out
a
phonograph
and
we
all
sat
round
like
one
family
swapping
information
and
yarns
even
up
while
the
music
went
on
when
we
left
next
morning
at
sunrise
it
seemed
that
we
were
leaving
home
and
the
river
reaches
looked
a
bit
dismal
all
that
day
having
once
been
a
vagabond
in
a
way
i
have
a
theory
about
the
physiognomy
of
houses
some
have
a
forbidding
aspect
about
them
not
at
all
due
i
am
sure
to
architectural
design
experience
has
taught
me
to
be
suspicious
of
such
houses
some
houses
have
the
appearance
of
death
their
windows
strike
you
as
eyeless
sockets
the
doors
look
like
mouths
that
can
not
speak
the
great
houses
along
fifth
avenue
seemed
like
that
to
me
i
could
walk
past
them
in
the
night
and
feel
like
a
ghost
i
have
seen
cottages
that
i
wanted
to
kneel
to
and
i
sure
this
feeling
was
due
to
the
vine
growing
over
the
porch
or
the
roses
nodding
in
the
yard
knock
at
the
door
of
such
a
house
and
the
chances
are
in
favor
of
your
being
met
by
a
quiet
motherly
woman
one
who
will
instantly
make
you
think
of
your
own
mother
some
very
well
constructed
houses
look
surly
and
some
shabby
ones
look
kind
somehow
if
you
have
ever
been
a
book
agent
or
a
tramp
how
you
will
revel
in
this
seeming
digression
god
grant
that
no
man
in
need
may
ever
look
wistfully
at
your
house
or
at
mine
and
pass
on
with
a
shake
of
the
head
it
is
a
subtle
compliment
to
have
book
agents
and
tramps
frequently
at
one
door
am
i
really
digressing
my
theme
is
a
trip
on
a
great
river
well
kindness
and
nature
are
not
so
far
apart
let
us
believe
now
this
looked
hospitable
there
was
no
mistaking
it
wherefore
i
deduce
that
the
spirit
of
the
inhabitants
must
pierce
through
and
emanate
from
the
senseless
walls
like
an
effluvium
who
knows
but
that
every
house
has
its
telltale
aura
plain
to
a
vision
of
sufficient
spiritual
keenness
perhaps
some
one
will
some
day
write
a
book
the
aspect
of
and
there
will
be
an
advance
sale
of
at
least
one
copy
on
that
book
at
noon
on
the
fourth
day
from
the
pen
and
key
ranch
we
pulled
up
at
the
mondak
landing
two
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
we
were
thoroughly
soaked
having
dragged
the
boat
the
last
two
or
three
miles
through
the
shallows
and
intermittent
deeps
of
an
inside
channel
the
outer
channel
was
rolling
viciously
in
that
eternal
thing
the
head
wind
we
had
covered
the
first
six
hundred
miles
with
a
power
boat
called
so
doubtless
because
it
required
so
much
power
to
shove
it
along
in
a
little
less
than
four
weeks
during
that
time
we
had
received
no
mail
and
i
was
making
a
break
for
the
oozing
and
feeling
like
an
animated
sponge
when
a
great
voice
roared
above
me
there
i
looked
up
to
the
hurricane
deck
of
a
steamer
that
lay
at
the
bank
taking
on
freight
a
large
elderly
man
dressed
like
a
farmer
with
an
exaggerated
straw
hat
shading
a
face
that
gripped
my
attention
at
once
was
looking
down
at
me
it
was
the
face
of
a
born
commander
it
struck
me
that
i
should
like
to
have
it
cast
in
bronze
to
look
at
whenever
a
vacillating
mood
might
seize
me
aboard
bawled
the
man
under
the
ample
hat
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
just
then
that
i
wished
for
more
than
my
mail
but
somehow
i
felt
the
will
to
obey
even
the
necessity
of
obeying
you
came
from
benton
he
asked
when
i
had
clambered
up
the
forward
companionway
and
stood
dripping
before
the
captain
of
the
steamer
at
this
closer
range
the
strength
of
the
face
was
even
more
impressive
with
its
eagle
beak
and
its
lines
of
firmness
but
a
light
of
kindness
was
shed
through
it
and
the
eyes
took
on
a
gentle
expression
how
did
you
find
the
water
very
low
sir
we
cordelled
much
of
the
way
i
tried
to
get
this
boat
to
benton
he
said
and
got
hung
up
on
the
rocks
above
lismus
ferry
and
we
drifted
over
them
at
midnight
he
smiled
and
we
were
friends
thus
i
met
captain
grant
marsh
the
grand
old
man
of
the
missouri
river
he
was
freighting
supplies
up
the
yellowstone
for
the
great
crane
creek
irrigation
dam
sixty
miles
above
the
mouth
the
was
to
sail
on
the
following
day
and
i
was
invited
to
go
along
seeing
that
the
captain
was
short
of
help
i
insisted
upon
enlisting
as
a
deck
hand
for
the
trip
it
was
work
i
think
i
should
prefer
as
a
profession
for
we
had
a
heavy
cargo
ranging
from
lumber
and
tiling
to
flour
and
beer
and
there
are
no
docks
on
the
yellowstone
the
banks
were
steep
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
the
cargo
had
to
be
landed
by
man
power
my
companions
in
toil
swore
bitterly
about
everything
in
general
and
steamboating
in
particular
how
much
are
you
getting
asked
a
young
dane
of
me
as
we
trudged
up
the
plank
together
nothing
at
all
i
said
he
swore
an
oath
of
wonder
and
stopped
to
look
me
over
carefully
for
the
loose
screw
in
my
nothing
but
the
fun
of
it
i
added
he
sniffed
and
looked
bewildered
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
said
i
that
a
man
will
do
for
nothing
what
he
would
do
for
money
i
could
see
my
conundrum
playing
all
about
his
stolid
features
after
that
the
dane
treated
me
with
an
air
of
superiority
the
superiority
of
thirty
dollars
per
month
over
nothing
at
all
we
stopped
twice
to
coal
and
worked
far
into
the
night
there
are
no
coal
chutes
on
the
yellowstone
we
carried
and
wheeled
the
stuff
aboard
from
a
pile
on
the
bank
during
a
brief
interval
of
rest
the
young
dane
announced
to
the
others
that
i
was
working
for
nothing
whereat
questioning
eyes
were
turned
upon
me
in
the
dull
lantern
light
and
i
said
to
myself
i
can
conceive
of
heaven
only
as
an
improbable
condition
in
which
all
men
would
be
willing
and
able
to
work
for
nothing
at
all
i
had
read
in
the
dane
face
the
meaning
of
a
price
heaving
coal
i
built
utopias
when
the
boat
was
under
way
i
sat
in
the
with
the
captain
watching
the
yellow
flood
and
the
yellow
cliffs
drift
past
like
a
vision
and
little
by
little
this
old
man
who
has
followed
the
river
for
over
sixty
years
pieced
out
the
wonderful
story
of
his
life
a
story
fit
for
homer
that
story
may
now
be
read
in
a
book
so
i
need
not
tell
it
here
but
i
came
to
think
of
him
as
the
incarnation
of
the
river
mighty
spirit
and
i
am
proud
that
i
served
him
as
a
deck
hand
as
we
steamed
out
of
the
yellowstone
into
the
clear
waters
of
the
missouri
the
captain
pointed
out
to
me
the
spot
upon
which
fort
union
stood
upon
landing
i
went
there
and
found
two
heaps
of
stone
at
the
opposite
corners
of
a
rectangle
traced
by
a
shallow
ditch
where
of
old
the
walls
stood
this
was
all
that
remained
of
the
powerful
fort
virtually
the
capital
of
the
american
fur
company
upper
missouri
empire
where
mackenzie
ruled
mackenzie
who
was
called
king
long
slough
grass
grew
there
and
blue
waxen
flowers
struggled
up
amid
the
rubble
of
what
were
once
defiant
bastions
i
lay
down
in
the
luxuriant
grass
closed
my
eyes
and
longed
for
a
vision
of
heroic
days
i
thought
of
the
prince
who
had
been
entertained
there
with
his
great
retinue
of
the
regality
of
the
haughty
scotchman
who
ruled
there
of
alexander
harvey
who
had
killed
his
enemy
on
the
very
spot
doubtless
where
i
lay
killed
him
as
an
outraged
brave
man
kills
face
to
face
before
the
world
i
thought
of
bourbonais
the
paris
of
this
fallen
ilium
i
thought
of
the
plague
that
raged
there
in
and
of
larpenteur
and
his
friend
grim
jesting
carters
of
the
dead
it
all
passed
before
me
the
unwritten
iliad
of
a
stronghold
forgotten
but
the
vision
would
come
the
river
wind
moaned
through
the
grasses
i
looked
off
a
half
mile
to
the
modern
town
of
mondak
and
wondered
how
many
in
that
town
cared
about
this
spot
where
so
much
had
happened
and
where
the
grass
grew
so
very
tall
now
i
gathered
blue
flowers
and
quoted
with
a
slight
change
the
lines
of
stevenson
but
ah
how
deep
the
grass
along
the
battlefield
chapter
viii
down
from
the
yellowstone
the
geographer
tells
us
that
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
is
about
seventeen
miles
above
louis
and
that
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
is
near
buford
north
dakota
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
fact
is
inverted
the
missouri
mouth
is
near
buford
and
the
yellowstone
empties
directly
into
the
mississippi
i
find
that
i
am
not
alone
in
this
opinion
father
de
smet
and
other
early
travelers
felt
the
truth
of
it
and
captain
marsh
who
has
piloted
river
craft
through
every
navigable
foot
of
the
entire
system
of
rivers
having
sailed
the
missouri
within
sound
of
the
falls
and
the
yellowstone
above
pompey
pillar
feels
that
the
yellowstone
is
the
main
stem
and
the
missouri
a
tributary
where
the
two
rivers
join
even
at
low
water
the
yellowstone
pours
a
vast
turbulent
flood
compared
with
which
the
clear
and
quieter
missouri
appears
an
overgrown
creek
the
mississippi
after
some
miles
obliterates
all
traces
of
its
great
western
tributary
but
the
missouri
at
buford
is
entirely
lost
in
the
yellowstone
within
a
few
hundred
yards
all
of
the
unique
characteristics
by
which
the
missouri
river
is
known
are
given
to
it
by
the
yellowstone
its
turbulence
its
tawniness
its
feline
treachery
its
giant
caprices
examine
closely
and
everything
will
take
on
before
your
eyes
either
masculine
or
feminine
traits
gender
in
a
broad
sense
is
universal
and
nothing
was
created
neuter
the
upper
missouri
is
decidedly
female
an
amazon
to
be
sure
but
nevertheless
not
a
man
beautiful
she
is
alluring
or
terrible
but
always
womanlike
but
when
you
strike
the
ragged
curdling
line
of
muddy
water
where
the
yellowstone
comes
in
it
is
all
changed
you
feel
the
sinewy
nervous
might
of
the
man
so
it
is
that
when
you
look
upon
the
missouri
at
kansis
city
it
is
the
yellowstone
that
you
behold

the
hurricane

in

site

but
names
are
idle
sounds
and
being
of
a
disposition
i
would
rather
withdraw
my
contention
than
seriously
disturb
the
geographical
let
it
be
said
that
the
upper
missouri
is
the
mother
and
the
yellowstone
the
father
of
this
turbulent
titan
who
inherits
his
father
might
and
wonder
and
takes
through
courtesy
the
maiden
name
of
his
mother
there
i
am
quite
appeased
and
the
geographers
may
retain
their
nomenclature
at
mondak
luck
stood
bowing
to
receive
us
the
had
suffered
more
from
contact
with
snags
and
rocks
than
we
had
supposed
for
several
hundred
miles
her
intake
of
water
had
steadily
increased
we
had
toiled
at
the
paddles
with
the
water
halfway
to
our
knees
much
of
the
time
though
now
and
then
by
spasms
we
bailed
her
dry
she
had
become
a
floating
lump
of
discouragement
and
still
fourteen
hundred
miles
lay
ahead
but
on
the
day
previous
to
our
sailing
a
nervous
little
man
with
a
wistful
eye
offered
us
a
trade
he
had
a
steel
boat
eighteen
feet
long
forty
inches
beam
which
he
had
built
in
the
hours
between
work
and
sleep
during
the
greater
part
of
a
year
his
boat
was
some
miles
up
the
yellowstone
but
he
spoke
of
her
in
so
artless
and
loving
a
manner
as
a
true
workman
might
speak
and
with
such
a
wistful
eye
cast
upon
our
boat
that
i
believed
in
him
and
his
boat
he
had
no
engine
it
was
the
engine
in
our
boat
that
attracted
him
as
he
wished
to
make
a
hunting
trip
up
river
in
the
fall
he
stated
that
his
boat
would
float
that
it
was
a
dry
boat
that
it
would
row
with
considerable
ease
then
said
i
paddle
her
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
and
the
deal
is
made
after
dark
he
returned
to
our
camp
with
a
motor
boat
ready
to
take
us
to
our
new
craft
leaving
all
our
impedimenta
to
be
shipped
by
rail
that
is
bill
the
tent
extra
blankets
phonograph
everything
but
a
few
an
ax
a
tarp
and
a
pair
of
blankets
the
kid
and
i
got
in
with
the
little
man
and
dropped
down
to
the
yellowstone
the
new
boat
was
moored
under
a
mud
bank
i
climbed
in
lit
a
match
and
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
she
was
staunch
and
beautiful
a
work
of
love
which
means
a
work
of
honesty
fore
and
aft
were
compartments
she
had
an
oil
tank
a
water
tank
engine
housing
steering
wheel
lockers
she
was
ready
for
the
very
engine
i
had
ordered
to
be
shipped
to
me
at
bismarck
she
was
dry
as
a
bone
and
broad
enough
to
make
a
snug
bed
for
two
the
little
man
and
the
motor
boat
dropped
out
into
the
gloom
and
left
us
gloating
over
our
new
possession
sending
thankful
rings
of
tobacco
smoke
at
the
stars
when
the
first
flush
of
triumph
had
passed
we
rolled
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
cooing
of
the
fusing
rivers
united
under
our
gunwale
such
a
sleep
a
sleep
and
the
sides
of
the
boat
protected
us
against
the
chill
night
wind
and
the
dawn
came
shouting
merrily
like
a
boy
i
once
had
a
chum
who
had
a
habit
of
whistling
me
out
of
bed
now
and
then
of
a
summer
morning
when
the
birds
were
just
awakening
and
the
dew
looked
like
frost
on
the
grass
and
the
sun
that
morning
made
me
think
of
my
old
boy
chum
with
his
blithe
persistent
whistling
for
the
first
hard
stage
of
the
journey
was
done
all
had
left
me
but
a
brave
lad
who
would
take
his
share
of
the
hardships
with
a
light
heart
all
boys
are
instinctively
true
sportsmen
and
before
us
lay
the
great
winding
stretch
of
a
savage
river
that
i
had
loved
long
the
real
missouri
of
my
boyhood
a
new
spirit
had
come
upon
us
with
the
possession
of
the
the
spirit
of
the
forced
march
for
nearly
a
month
we
had
floundered
trusting
to
a
sick
engine
and
inefficient
paddles
now
we
had
a
staunch
dry
boat
and
oars
we
trusted
only
ourselves
and
we
were
one
in
the
desire
to
push
the
crooked
yellow
miles
behind
us
during
the
entire
fourteen
hundred
miles
that
desire
increased
until
our
progress
was
little
more
than
a
retreat
we
pitched
no
camps
we
halted
only
when
we
could
proceed
no
further
owing
to
sandbars
encountered
in
the
dark
we
ate
as
we
found
it
convenient
to
do
so
regularly
relieving
each
other
at
the
oars
one
sat
at
the
steering
wheel
feeling
for
the
channel
and
it
was
not
long
until
i
began
to
note
a
remarkable
change
in
the
muscles
of
the
kid
for
we
toiled
naked
to
the
waist
most
of
the
time
his
muscles
had
shown
little
more
than
a
girl
when
we
first
swam
together
at
benton
now
they
began
to
stand
out
clearly
defined
those
of
his
chest
sprawling
rigidly
downward
to
the
lean
ribs
and
little
eloquent
knots
developed
on
the
bronzed
surface
of
his
once
smooth
arms
he
was
at
the
age
of
change
and
he
was
growing
into
a
man
before
my
eyes
it
was
good
to
see
all
the
first
day
the
gods
breathed
gently
upon
us
and
we
made
fifty
miles
passing
trenton
and
williston
before
dark
but
the
following
day
our
old
enemy
the
head
wind
came
with
the
dawn
we
were
now
sailing
a
river
more
than
twice
the
size
of
the
upper
missouri
and
the
waves
were
in
proportion
each
at
an
oar
with
the
steering
wheel
lashed
we
forged
on
slowly
but
steadily
in
midstream
we
found
it
impossible
to
control
the
boat
and
though
we
hugged
the
shore
whenever
possible
we
were
obliged
to
cross
with
the
channel
at
every
bend
when
the
waves
caught
us
broadside
we
were
treated
to
many
a
compulsory
bath
and
our
clothes
were
thoroughly
washed
without
being
removed
an
ordinary
skiff
would
have
capsized
early
in
the
day
but
the
could
carry
a
full
cargo
of
water
and
still
float
by
sunset
the
wind
fell
the
river
smoothed
as
a
wrinkled
brow
at
the
touch
of
peace
aided
by
a
fair
current
we
skulled
along
in
the
hush
of
evening
through
a
land
of
vast
green
pastures
with
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
the
great
wind
had
spread
the
heavens
with
ever
deepening
clouds
the
last
reflected
light
of
the
sun
fell
red
upon
the
burnished
surface
of
the
water
it
seemed
we
were
sailing
a
river
of
liquefied
red
flame
only
for
a
short
distance
about
us
was
the
water
of
that
peculiar
missouri
hue
which
makes
one
think
of
bad
coffee
colored
with
condensed
milk
slowly
the
colors
changed
until
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
stream
of
iridescent
opal
fires
and
quite
lost
in
the
gorgeous
spectacle
at
length
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
bar
we
got
out
and
waded
around
in
water
scarcely
to
our
ankles
feeling
for
a
channel
the
sand
was
hard
the
bar
seemed
to
extend
across
the
entire
river
but
a
thin
rippling
line
some
fifty
yards
ahead
told
us
where
it
ended
we
found
it
impossible
to
push
the
heavy
boat
over
the
shallows
the
clouds
were
deepening
and
the
night
was
coming
rapidly
setting
the
kid
to
work
digging
with
an
oar
at
the
prow
i
pushed
and
wriggled
the
stern
until
i
saw
galaxies
thus
alternately
digging
and
pushing
we
at
last
reached
navigable
depths
it
was
now
quiet
and
dark
low
thunder
was
rolling
and
now
and
then
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
discovered
the
moaning
river
to
us
ghastly
and
forbidding
in
the
momentary
glare
we
decided
to
pull
in
for
the
night
but
in
what
direction
should
we
pull
a
drizzling
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
the
sheet
lightning
glaring
through
it
only
confused
us
more
than
the
sooty
darkness
that
showered
in
upon
us
after
the
rapid
flashes
we
sat
still
and
waited
in
the
intermittent
silences
the
rain
hissed
on
the
surface
of
the
river
like
a
shower
of
innumerable
heated
pebbles
ahead
of
us
we
heard
the
dull
booming
of
the
cut
banks
as
the
current
undermined
ponderous
ledges
of
sand
now
a
boat
that
happens
under
a
falling
cut
bank
passes
at
once
into
the
region
of
forgotten
things
the
boat
would
follow
the
main
current
the
main
current
flows
always
under
the
cut
banks
how
long
would
it
take
us
to
get
there
which
way
should
we
pull
put
a
simpler
question
in
which
way
were
we
moving
we
had
the
least
conception
of
direction
for
us
the
night
had
only
one
dimension
finally
a
great
booming
and
splashing
sounded
to
our
left
and
the
boat
rocked
violently
a
moment
after
we
grasped
the
oars
and
pulled
blindly
in
what
we
supposed
to
be
the
opposite
direction
only
to
be
met
by
another
roar
of
falling
sand
from
that
quarter
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
have
faith
in
that
divinity
which
is
said
to
superintend
the
goings
and
coming
of
fools
and
drunkards
therefore
we
abandoned
the
oars
twiddled
our
thumbs
and
let
her
drift
we
could
even
smoke
for
the
rain
was
now
coming
down
merrily
the
kid
thought
it
a
great
lark
and
laughed
boisterously
at
our
predicament
by
flashes
i
saw
the
drenched
grin
under
his
dripping
nose
but
for
me
some
lines
written
by
that
sinister
genius
wainwright
came
back
with
a
new
force
and
clamored
to
be
spoken
darkness
sooty
portentous
darkness
shrouds
the
whole
scene
as
if
through
a
horrid
rift
in
a
murky
ceiling
a
rainy
deluge
flaw
discolored
water
streams
down
amain
spreading
a
grisly
spectral
light
even
more
horrible
than
that
palpable
night
at
length
the
sensation
of
sudden
stopping
dizzied
us
momentarily
we
thrust
out
an
oar
and
felt
a
slowly
sloping
bar
driving
the
oar
into
the
soft
sand
we
wrapped
the
boat
chain
about
it
and
went
to
bed
flinging
the
tarp
over
us
a
raw
dawn
wind
sprinkled
a
cheerless
morning
over
us
and
we
got
up
with
our
joints
grinding
rustily
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
desolate
waste
of
sand
and
water
the
bar
upon
which
we
had
lodged
was
utterly
bare
drinking
a
can
of
condensed
milk
between
us
we
pushed
on
that
day
we
found
ourselves
in
the
country
of
red
barns
it
was
like
warming
cold
hands
before
an
open
grate
to
look
upon
them
at
noon
we
saw
the
first
of
the
trip
an
undulating
golden
flood
dimpled
with
the
tripping
feet
of
the
wind
these
were
two
joys
quite
enough
for
one
day
but
in
the
afternoon
the
third
came
the
first
my
first
impulse
was
to
take
off
my
hat
to
it
offer
it
my
hand
that
evening
we
pulled
up
to
a
great
bank
with
outcrops
of
coal
and
cooked
supper
over
a
civilized
fire
for
many
miles
along
the
river
in
north
dakota
as
well
as
along
the
yellowstone
in
montana
these
coal
outcrops
are
in
evidence
doubtless
within
another
generation
vast
mining
operations
will
be
opened
up
in
these
localities
coal
barges
will
be
loaded
at
the
mines
and
dropped
down
stream
to
the
nearest
railroad
point
we
were
in
the
midst
of
an
idyllic
country
green
sloping
pastures
dotted
sparsely
with
grotesque
scrub
oaks
far
over
these
the
distant
hills
lifted
in
filmy
blue
the
bluffs
along
the
water
edge
were
streaked
with
black
and
red
and
yellow
their
colors
deepened
by
the
recent
rains
lazy
with
a
liberal
supper
we
drifted
idly
and
gave
ourselves
over
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
spell
of
this
twilight
dreamland
i
stared
hard
upon
this
scene
that
would
have
delighted
theocritus
and
with
little
effort
i
placed
a
shepherd
boy
under
the
umbrella
top
of
that
scrub
oak
away
up
yonder
on
the
lawny
slope
with
his
knees
huddled
to
his
chin
i
saw
him
his
fresh
cheeks
bulged
with
the
breath
of
music
i
heard
his
pipe
clear
the
silent
music
of
my
own
heart
dream
flocks
sprawled
tinkling
up
the
hills
with
a
wild
burst
of
scarlet
the
sunset
flashed
out
black
clouds
darkened
the
visible
idyll
a
chill
gust
swept
across
the
stream
showering
rain
and
darkness
each
at
an
oar
we
forged
on
until
we
lost
the
channel
in
the
gloom
at
the
first
peep
of
day
we
were
off
again
after
a
breakfast
of
pancakes
bacon
and
coffee
we
were
gradually
becoming
accustomed
to
the
strain
of
constant
rowing
for
at
least
sixteen
hours
a
day
we
fought
the
wind
during
which
time
the
oars
were
constantly
dipping
and
very
often
our
day
lengthened
out
to
twenty
hours
we
had
no
and
a
night
of
drifting
was
divided
into
two
watches
these
watches
we
determined
either
by
the
dropping
of
a
star
toward
the
horizon
or
by
the
position
of
the
moon
when
it
shone
on
dark
nights
the
sleeper
trusted
to
the
judgment
of
his
friend
to
call
when
the
watch
seemed
sufficiently
long
daily
the
water
fell
and
every
inch
of
fall
increased
the
difficulty
of
traveling
we
were
now
passing
through
the
country
of
the
mandans
gros
ventres
and
ricarees
the
country
through
which
old
hugh
glass
crawled
his
hundred
miles
with
only
hate
to
sustain
him
to
the
west
lay
the
barren
lands
of
the
little
missouri
through
which
sully
pushed
with
his
military
expedition
against
the
sioux
on
the
yellowstone
an
army
flung
boldly
through
a
dead
land
a
land
without
forage
and
waterless
a
labyrinth
of
dry
ravines
and
ghastly
hills
sully
called
it
hell
with
the
lights
out
a
magnificent
quixotic
expedition
that
succeeded
i
compared
it
with
the
ancient
expeditions
and
i
felt
the
eagle
wings
strain
within
me
there
were
trumpets
and
purple
banners
for
me
in
the
sound
of
the
name
late
in
the
evening
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
little
missouri
there
we
found
one
of
the
few
remaining
mud
lodges
of
the
ancient
type
we
landed
and
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
forsaken
little
frontier
town
a
shambling
shack
bore
the
legend
store
with
the
s
looking
backward
perhaps
toward
dead
municipal
hopes
a
few
frame
and
log
shanties
sprawled
up
the
desultory
main
street
at
one
end
of
which
dwelt
a
mandan
indian
family
in
the
mud
lodge
a
dozen
curs
from
the
lodge
resented
our
intrusion
with
canine
vituperation
i
thrust
my
head
into
the
entrance
of
the
circular
house
of
mud
and
was
greeted
with
a
sound
of
scolding
in
the
mandan
jargon
delivered
by
a
squaw
of
at
least
eighty
years
she
arose
from
the
fire
that
burned
in
the
center
of
the
great
circular
room
and
approached
me
with
an
expression
one
of
her
daughters
a
girl
dressed
in
a
caricature
of
the
white
girl
garments
said
to
me
she
wants
to
know
what
you
got
to
trade
to
this
old
woman
of
the
prairie
all
white
men
were
traders
i
want
to
buy
i
said
eggs
meat
bread
anything
to
eat
illustration
boats

up
for

the

at

the
old
woman
looked
me
over
with
a
whimper
of
amused
superiority
and
disappeared
soon
reappearing
with
a
dark
brown
object
not
wholly
unlike
a
loaf
of
bread
wahtoo
she
remarked
pointing
to
the
dark
brown
substance
i
gave
her
a
very
quietly
she
took
it
and
went
back
to
her
fire
but
said
i
do
you
sell
your
bread
for
fifty
cents
per
loaf
the
girl
giggled
and
the
old
woman
gave
me
another
piece
of
her
mandan
mind
she
had
no
change
it
appeared
i
then
insisted
upon
taking
the
balance
in
eggs
the
old
woman
said
she
had
no
eggs
i
pointed
to
a
flock
of
hens
that
was
holding
a
sort
of
woman
club
convention
in
the
yard
discussing
the
esthetics
of
doubtless
while
neglecting
their
nests
the
old
lady
arose
majestically
disappeared
again
and
reappeared
with
three
eggs
i
protested
the
mandan
lady
forthwith
explained
or
at
least
it
appeared
so
to
me
all
the
execrable
points
in
my
character
they
seemed
to
be
numerous
and
she
appeared
to
be
very
frank
about
the
matter
my
moral
condition
apparently
was
clearly
defined
in
her
own
mind
i
withdrew
in
haste
fearing
that
the
daughter
at
any
moment
might
begin
to
translate
we
dropped
down
river
a
few
miles
prepared
supper
and
attacked
the
dark
brown
substance
which
the
indian
lady
had
called
wahtoo
at
the
first
bite
i
began
to
learn
the
mandan
tongue
i
swallowed
a
chunk
whole
and
then
enlightened
the
kid
as
to
a
portion
of
the
mandan
language
wahtoo
said
i
means
it
is
an
evident
fact
then
being
strengthened
by
our
linguistic
triumph
we
fell
upon
the
dark
brown
substance
again
but
almost
anything
has
its
good
points
and
i
can
conscientiously
recommend
mandan
bread
for
durability
once
more
we
had
a
rainy
night
the
tarp
stretched
across
the
boat
sagged
with
the
water
it
caught
and
poured
little
persistent
streams
upon
us
the
chief
of
these
streams
from
the
point
of
size
seemed
consciously
aiming
at
my
ear
thirce
i
turned
over
shifted
my
position
thrice
i
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
merry
brooklet
pouring
into
that
persecuted
member
somewhere
in
the
world
the
white
cock
was
crowing
sleepily
when
we
put
off
stiff
and
soaked
and
shivering
early
in
the
day
the
fine
sand
from
banks
and
bars
began
to
lift
in
the
wind
it
smarted
our
faces
like
little
whip
lashes
very
often
we
could
see
no
further
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
any
direction
only
by
a
constant
rapid
dipping
of
the
oars
could
the
boat
be
held
perpendicular
to
the
choppy
waves
one
stroke
missed
meant
hard
work
for
both
of
us
in
getting
out
of
the
trough
fighting
every
foot
of
water
we
wallowed
through
the
swells
past
elbow
woods
past
fort
berthold
past
the
forlorn
raggedy
little
town
expansion
we
rechristened
it
contraction
during
the
day
the
gale
swept
the
sky
clear
the
evening
air
was
crisp
and
invigorating
we
cooked
supper
early
and
rowed
on
silently
over
the
mirroring
waters
between
two
vast
sheets
of
stars
through
a
semilucent
immensity
far
ahead
of
us
a
high
cliff
loomed
black
and
huge
against
the
spangled
velvet
of
the
sky
on
its
summit
a
dark
mass
soared
higher
we
thought
it
a
tree
but
surely
a
gigantic
one
approaching
it
the
soaring
mass
became
a
medieval
castle
sitting
haughtily
with
frowning
crenellations
upon
an
impregnable
rock
and
the
missouri
became
for
the
moment
a
larger
rhine
at
last
rowing
up
under
the
sheer
cliff
the
castle
resolved
itself
into
a
huge
grain
elevator
its
base
a
hundred
feet
above
the
stream
although
it
was
late
we
tied
our
boat
clambered
up
a
zigzag
path
and
found
ourselves
in
one
of
the
oddest
little
towns
in
the
west
manhaven
one
of
the
few
remaining
steamboat
towns
the
main
street
zigzagged
carelessly
through
a
jumble
of
little
houses
one
light
in
all
the
street
designated
the
social
center
of
the
town
so
we
went
there
it
was
the
grocery
store
a
general
emporium
of
ideas
and
canned
goods
entering
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
the
rustic
cackle
of
the
burg
i
am
sure
the
municipal
convention
was
verbally
reconstructing
the
universe
but
upon
our
entrance
the
matter
was
abruptly
laid
on
the
table
when
we
withdrew
the
entire
convention
including
the
adjourned
and
accompanied
us
to
the
river
where
the
general
merits
of
our
boat
were
thoroughly
discussed
by
lantern
light
also
various
conflicting
versions
of
the
distance
to
bismarck
were
given
each
party
being
certain
of
his
own
infallibility
there
is
something
curious
about
the
average
man
conception
of
distance
during
the
entire
trip
we
found
no
two
men
who
agreed
on
this
general
subject
after
acquiring
a
book
of
river
distances
we
created
much
amusement
for
ourselves
by
asking
questions
the
conversation
very
often
proceeded
in
this
manner
will
you
please
tell
us
how
far
it
is
to
one
hundred
and
and
a
half
miles
with
an
air
of
absolute
certainty
but
you
are
slightly
mistaken
sir
the
exact
distance
is
and
miles
consternation
on
the
face
of
the
omniscient
informant
once
a
man
told
us
that
a
certain
town
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
down
stream
we
reached
the
town
in
an
hour
and
a
half
however
we
had
more
success
with
the
indian
one
day
we
came
upon
an
old
mandan
buck
and
squaw
who
were
taking
a
bath
in
the
river
doubtless
feeling
convinced
that
they
needed
it
the
current
took
us
within
fifty
yards
of
them
upon
our
approach
they
got
out
of
the
water
and
sat
in
the
sand
quite
as
nude
and
unashamed
as
our
first
parents
before
the
apple
ripened
bismarck
how
far
i
shouted
standing
up
in
the
boat
the
buck
rose
in
all
his
unclothed
dignity
raised
his
two
hands
shut
and
opened
them
seven
times
after
which
he
lowered
one
arm
and
again
opened
and
shut
a
hand
then
with
a
thrust
of
the
arm
toward
the
southeast
he
stiffened
the
index
finger
in
the
direction
of
bismarck
he
meant
miles
as
the
crow
flies
as
near
as
i
could
figure
it
out
afterward
he
was
doubtless
correct
at
noon
the
next
day
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
knife
river
near
which
stood
the
mandan
village
made
famous
by
lewis
and
clark
as
their
winter
quarters
fort
clark
also
stood
here
nothing
remains
of
the
fort
but
the
name
and
a
few
slight
indentations
in
the
ground
a
modern
steamboat
town
deapolis
occupies
the
site
of
the
old
post
across
the
river
there
are
still
to
be
seen
the
remains
of
trenches
a
farmer
pointed
them
out
to
us
as
all
that
remains
of
the
winter
camp
of
the
great
explorers
in
the
late
evening
we
passed
washburn
the
steamboat
center
of
the
upper
river
fifty
water
miles
from
bismarck
it
made
a
very
pretty
appearance
with
its
neat
houses
climbing
the
hillside
along
the
water
front
under
the
elevators
a
steamboats
of
the
good
type
lay
waiting
for
their
cargoes
two
more
boats
were
building
on
the
ways
night
caught
us
some
five
miles
below
the
town
and
wrapping
ourselves
in
our
blankets
we
set
to
drifting
i
went
on
watch
and
the
kid
rolled
up
forward
and
went
to
sleep
after
sixteen
hours
of
rowing
in
the
wind
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
keep
awake
the
night
was
very
calm
the
quiet
waters
crooned
sleepily
about
the
boat
i
set
myself
the
task
of
watching
the
new
moon
dip
toward
the
dim
hills
i
intended
to
keep
myself
awake
in
that
manner
the
moon
seemed
to
have
stuck
slowly
i
passed
into
an
impossible
world
in
which
with
drowsy
will
i
struggled
against
an
exasperating
moon
that
had
somehow
gotten
itself
tangled
in
and
could
go
down
i
awoke
with
a
start
my
head
was
hanging
over
the
gunwale
the
dawn
was
breaking
through
the
night
wall
a
chill
wind
was
rolling
breakers
upon
us
and
we
were
fast
upon
a
bar
i
awakened
the
kid
and
we
put
off
we
had
no
idea
of
the
distance
covered
while
sleeping
it
must
have
been
at
least
twenty
miles
for
against
a
heavy
wind
we
reached
bismarck
at
one
we
had
covered
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
six
days
but
we
had
paid
well
for
every
mile
as
we
passed
under
the
bismarck
bridge
we
confessed
that
we
were
thoroughly
fagged
it
was
the
thought
of
the
engine
awaiting
us
at
this
town
that
had
kept
us
from
confessing
weariness
before
i
landed
and
made
for
the
express
office
three
miles
away
a
later
i
stood
covered
with
humility
and
perspiration
in
the
awful
presence
of
the
expressman
who
regarded
me
with
that
lofty
air
characteristic
of
some
emperors
and
almost
all
railroad
officials
i
stated
to
the
august
personage
that
i
was
looking
for
an
engine
shipped
to
me
by
express
it
seems
that
my
statement
was
insulting
the
man
snarled
and
shook
his
head
i
have
since
thought
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
northern
pacific
system
in
disguise
i
suggested
that
the
personage
might
look
about
the
personage
could
stoop
to
that
but
a
clerk
who
overheard
my
insulting
remark
he
had
not
yet
become
the
owner
of
a
vast
transportation
system
condescended
to
make
a
desultory
search
he
succeeded
in
digging
up
a
and
that
is
all
i
ever
saw
of
the
engine
during
my
waiting
at
bismarck
i
had
a
talk
with
captain
baker
manager
of
the
benton
packet
line
we
agreed
in
regard
to
the
neglect
of
duty
toward
the
country
most
important
natural
thoroughfare
the
missouri
river
about
sioux
city
the
government
operates
a
the
at
an
expense
ridiculously
disproportionate
to
its
usefulness
the
is
little
more
than
an
excursion
boat
maintained
for
a
few
who
are
paid
for
indulging
in
the
excursions
a
crew
of
several
hundred
men
with
shovels
picks
and
dynamite
could
do
more
good
during
one
low
water
season
than
such
boats
could
do
during
their
entire
existence
the
value
of
the
great
river
as
an
avenue
of
commerce
is
steadily
increasing
and
those
who
discourage
the
idea
of
reopening
navigation
of
the
river
are
either
railroad
men
or
persons
entirely
ignorant
of
the
geography
of
the
northwest
captain
marsh
would
say
reopen
navigation
i
sailed
the
river
sixty
years
and
in
that
time
navigation
has
not
ceased
rocks
could
and
should
be
removed
from
the
various
rapids
and
the
banks
at
certain
points
should
be
protected
against
further
cutting
a
natural
canal
extending
from
new
orleans
in
the
south
and
cincinnati
in
the
east
to
the
rockies
in
the
northwest
is
not
to
be
neglected
long
by
an
intelligent
government
as
a
slow
freight
thoroughfare
this
vast
natural
system
of
waterways
is
unequalled
on
the
globe
within
another
generation
doubtless
this
fact
will
be
generally
rediscovered
having
waited
four
days
for
the
engine
we
put
off
again
with
oars
it
was
near
sundown
when
we
started
hungry
for
those
thousand
miles
that
remained
when
we
had
pulled
in
to
the
landing
at
bismarck
we
were
like
boxers
who
stagger
to
their
corners
all
but
whipped
but
we
had
breathed
and
were
ready
for
another
round
a
kind
of
impersonal
anger
at
the
failure
of
another
hope
nerved
us
and
this
new
fighting
spirit
was
like
another
man
at
the
oars
many
of
the
hard
days
that
followed
left
on
our
memories
little
more
than
the
impress
of
a
troubled
dream
we
developed
a
sort
of
contempt
for
our
old
enemy
the
head
wind
that
tireless
intangible
giant
that
lashed
us
with
whips
of
sand
drove
us
into
shallows
set
its
mighty
shoulders
against
our
prow
roared
with
laughter
at
us
when
soaked
and
weary
we
walked
and
pushed
our
boat
for
miles
at
a
time
the
quitter
that
is
in
all
men
more
or
less
often
whispered
to
us
when
we
were
weariest
why
not
take
the
train
what
is
it
all
for
well
what
is
life
for
we
were
expressing
ourselves
out
there
on
the
windy
river
the
wind
said
we
could
and
our
muscles
said
we
should
and
the
captain
had
said
we
could
get
down
so
we
went
on
we
were
now
in
full
retreat
retreat
from
the
possibility
of
quitting
during
the
first
night
out
an
odd
circumstance
befell
us
that
for
some
hours
seemed
likely
to
lose
us
our
boat
as
usual
we
set
to
drifting
at
dark
the
moon
close
on
its
half
was
flying
pale
and
frightened
through
scudding
clouds
however
the
wind
blew
high
and
the
surface
of
the
water
was
unruffled
there
could
be
nothing
more
eerie
than
a
night
of
drifting
on
the
missouri
with
a
ghastly
moon
dodging
in
and
out
among
the
clouds
the
strange
glimmer
peculiar
to
the
surface
of
the
tawny
river
at
night
gives
it
a
forbidding
aspect
and
you
seem
surrounded
by
a
murmuring
immensity
we
were
presumably
drifting
into
a
great
sandy
bend
for
we
heard
the
constant
booming
of
falling
sand
ahead
it
was
impossible
to
trace
the
channel
so
we
swung
idly
about
with
the
current
suddenly
we
stopped
our
usual
proceeding
in
such
cases
was
to
leap
out
and
push
the
boat
off
that
night
fortunately
we
were
chilly
and
did
not
fancy
a
midnight
ducking
each
taking
an
oar
we
thrust
at
the
bar
the
oars
went
down
to
the
grip
in
quicksand
had
we
leaped
out
as
usual
there
would
have
been
two
burials
that
night
without
the
customary
singing
we
rocked
the
boat
without
result
we
were
trapped
so
we
smoked
awhile
thought
about
the
matter
and
decided
to
go
to
bed
in
the
morning
we
would
fasten
on
our
cork
belts
and
reach
shore
perhaps
having
reached
shore
we
would
find
a
stray
skiff
and
go
on
but
the
seemed
booked
for
a
long
wait
on
that
quicksand
bar
during
the
night
a
violent
shaking
of
the
boat
awakened
us
a
heavy
wind
was
blowing
and
the
prow
of
the
boat
was
swinging
about
it
soon
stopped
with
a
chug
we
stood
up
and
rocked
the
boat
vigorously
it
broke
loose
again
and
swung
around
continuing
this
for
a
we
finally
drifted
into
deep
water
the
next
day
we
passed
cannon
ball
river
and
reached
standing
rock
agency
in
the
late
evening
sitting
bull
is
buried
there
after
a
late
supper
we
went
in
search
of
his
grave
we
found
it
after
much
lighting
of
matches
at
headstones
in
a
corner
of
the
agency
a
slab
of
wood
painted
white
bears
the
following
inscription
in
black
in
memory
of
sitting
bull
died
perched
upon
the
grave
we
smoked
for
an
hour
under
the
flying
moon
a
dog
howled
somewhere
off
in
the
gloomy
waste
that
night
the
erinnyes
in
the
form
of
a
swarm
of
mosquitoes
attacked
us
lying
in
our
boat
the
weary
kid
rolled
and
swore
till
dawn
when
a
light
wind
sprang
up
we
hoisted
our
sail
and
for
one
whole
day
cruised
merrily
making
sixty
miles
by
sunset
this
took
us
to
the
town
of
mobridge
i
was
charmed
with
the
novelty
of
driving
our
old
enemy
in
harness
so
letting
the
kid
go
to
sleep
forward
under
the
sail
i
cruised
on
into
the
night
the
wind
had
fallen
somewhat
but
it
kept
the
canvas
filled
the
crooning
of
the
water
the
rustling
of
the
sail
the
thin
voices
of
bugs
on
shore
and
the
guttural
song
of
the
frogs
shocking
the
general
quiet
these
sounds
only
intensified
the
weird
calm
of
the
night
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
the
moon
shone
so
brightly
that
i
wrote
my
notes
by
its
glow
the
winking
lights
of
mobridge
slowly
dropped
astern
and
faded
into
the
glimmering
mist
lonely
seamen
all
the
night
sail
astonished
amid
stars
the
remembered
lines
gave
me
the
divine
itch
for
quoting
verses
i
did
so
until
the
poor
tired
kid
swore
drowsily
in
his
sleep
under
the
mast
the
air
was
of
that
invigorating
coolness
that
makes
you
think
of
cider
in
its
sociable
stage
of
incipient
snappiness
sleepy
dogs
bayed
far
away
lone
trees
approached
me
the
motion
seeming
to
belong
to
them
rather
than
to
me
and
drifted
slowly
past
austere
spectral
figures
somewhere
about
midnight
i
fell
asleep
and
was
awakened
by
a
flapping
sail
and
a
groaning
mast
to
find
myself
sprawling
over
the
wheel
the
wind
had
changed
it
was
once
more
blowing
and
a
drizzling
rain
was
driving
through
the
gloom
during
my
sleep
the
boat
had
gone
ashore
i
moored
her
to
a
drift
log
lowered
sail
flung
a
tarp
over
us
and
went
to
sleep
again
and
the
morning
came
blanketed
with
gray
oozing
fog
the
greater
part
of
that
day
we
rowed
on
in
the
rain
without
a
covering
in
the
evening
we
reached
forest
city
an
odd
little
old
town
looking
wistfully
across
stream
at
the
youthful
red
and
white
government
buildings
of
the
cheyenne
agency
illustration
the
yankton
landing
in
the
old
days
illustration
atom
ii
landing
at
sioux
city
despite
its
name
this
town
is
utterly
treeless
i
once
knew
a
particularly
awkward
homely
and
freckled
young
lady
named
lily
the
circumstance
always
seemed
grimly
humorous
to
me
and
i
remembered
it
as
we
strolled
through
the
town
that
could
live
up
to
its
name
we
were
ravenously
hungry
and
as
soon
as
possible
we
got
our
feet
under
the
table
of
the
town
dingy
restaurant
a
long
lean
man
came
to
take
our
orders
he
was
a
walking
picture
of
that
condition
known
to
patent
medicine
as
before
taking
i
looked
for
the
fat
cheerful
person
who
should
illustrate
the
effect
of
eating
at
that
place
but
in
vain
when
the
lean
man
reappeared
with
the
two
orders
carefully
tucked
away
in
the
palms
of
his
bony
hands
i
thought
i
grasped
the
etiology
of
his
thinness
it
was
indeed
a
frugal
repast
we
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
please
consider
us
four
hearty
men
if
you
will
i
said
kindly
and
bring
two
more
meals
the
man
obeyed
my
order
it
seems
met
objections
from
the
cook
the
lean
man
after
a
half
audible
colloquy
with
the
presiding
spirit
of
the
kitchen
reported
with
a
whipped
expression
that
the
house
was
all
out
of
grub
i
regretted
the
matter
very
much
as
i
had
looked
forward
to
a
long
unbroken
series
of
meals
that
evening
setting
out
at
moonrise
just
after
sunset
we
reached
pascal
island
fifteen
miles
below
before
sleep
came
upon
us
in
a
manner
not
to
be
resisted
all
night
coyotes
yelped
from
the
hilltops
about
us
recounting
their
immemorial
sorrows
to
the
wandering
moon
at
sunset
of
the
fifth
day
from
bismarck
we
pulled
in
at
pierre
although
i
had
never
been
there
before
carthage
was
not
more
hospitable
to
Ã¦neas
than
pierre
to
the
crew
of
the
at
a
reception
given
us
by
doane
robinson
secretary
of
the
state
historical
society
i
felt
again
the
warmth
of
the
great
heart
of
the
west
during
the
first
night
out
of
pierre
the
kid
having
stood
his
watch
called
me
at
about
one
the
moon
was
sailing
high
i
grasped
the
oars
and
fell
to
rowing
with
a
resolute
swing
meaning
in
the
shortest
possible
time
to
wear
off
the
disagreeable
stupor
incident
to
arising
at
that
time
of
night
i
had
been
rowing
for
some
time
when
i
noted
a
tree
on
the
bank
near
which
the
current
ran
still
drowsy
i
turned
my
head
away
and
pulled
with
a
will
after
another
spell
of
energetic
rowing
i
looked
astern
expecting
to
see
that
tree
at
least
a
mile
behind
there
was
no
tree
in
sight
and
yet
i
could
see
in
that
direction
with
sufficient
clearness
to
discern
the
bulk
of
a
tree
if
any
were
there
i
am
rowing
to
beat
the
devil
thought
i
that
tree
is
away
around
the
bend
already
so
i
increased
the
speed
and
length
of
my
stroke
and
began
to
come
out
of
my
stupor
some
time
later
i
happened
to
look
behind
me
tree
in
question
was
about
three
hundred
yards
ahead
of
the
boat
i
had
been
rowing
for
at
least
a
in
a
strenuous
race
with
that
tree
the
kid
aroused
by
my
laughter
asked
sleepily
what
in
thunder
tickled
me
i
told
him
i
had
merely
thought
of
a
funny
story
whereat
he
mumbled
some
unintelligble
anathema
and
lapsed
again
into
a
snoring
state
but
i
claim
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
man
on
record
who
ever
raced
a
with
a
tree
and
finished
three
city
blocks
to
the
bad
the
next
day
we
rounded
the
great
loop
in
which
the
river
makes
a
detour
of
thirty
miles
having
rowed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
we
found
ourselves
in
the
evening
only
two
or
three
miles
from
a
point
we
had
reached
in
the
morning
in
a
drizzling
rain
we
passed
brule
agency
in
the
evening
soppy
and
chilled
we
were
pulling
past
a
shanty
built
under
the
bluffs
when
a
man
stepped
from
the
door
and
hailed
us
we
pulled
in
you
fellers
looks
like
you
needed
a
drink
of
booze
said
the
man
as
we
stepped
ashore
well
i
got
it
for
sale
and
it
ai
no
harm
to
advertise
this
strenuous
liquor
merchant
bore
about
him
all
the
wretched
marks
of
the
stuff
he
sold
have
your
wife
cook
us
two
meals
said
i
and
i
deal
with
you
jump
in
my
boat
said
he
i
got
in
his
skiff
wondering
what
his
whim
might
mean
after
several
strokes
of
the
oars
he
pulled
a
flask
from
his
pocket
took
my
coin
and
rowed
back
to
shore
government
license
he
explained
got
to
sell
thirty
feet
from
the
bank
poor
old
government
thought
i
they
beat
you
wherever
they
deal
with
you
we
went
up
to
the
wretched
shanty
built
of
driftwood
and
entered
the
interior
was
a
mÃªlÃ©e
of
washtubs
rickety
chairs
babies
and
flies
the
woman
of
the
house
hung
out
a
ragged
smile
upon
her
puckered
mouth
etched
at
the
lips
with
many
thin
lines
of
worry
and
aped
hospitality
in
a
manner
at
once
pathetic
and
ridiculous
a
little
girl
who
looked
fifty
or
five
according
to
how
you
observed
her
dexterously
dodged
the
drip
from
the
cracks
in
the
roof
as
she
backed
away
into
a
corner
from
whence
she
regarded
us
with
eyes
already
saddened
with
the
ache
of
life
after
many
days
and
nights
in
the
great
open
fraternizing
with
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
the
sun
and
the
river
it
gave
me
a
heartache
to
have
the
old
bitter
human
fact
thrust
upon
me
again
what
is
there
left
here
to
live
for
thought
i
and
just
then
i
noted
hanging
on
the
wall
where
the
water
did
not
drip
a
neatly
framed
marriage
certificate
this
was
the
one
attempt
at
decoration
it
was
the
household
of
respectability
this
woman
even
in
her
degradation
true
to
the
noblest
instinct
of
her
sex
clung
to
this
holy
record
of
a
faded
glory
two
days
later
pushing
on
in
the
starlit
night
we
heard
ahead
the
sullen
boom
of
waters
in
turmoil
for
a
as
we
proceeded
the
sound
increased
until
it
seemed
close
under
our
prow
we
knew
there
was
no
cataract
in
the
entire
lower
portion
of
the
river
and
yet
only
from
a
waterfall
had
i
ever
heard
a
sound
like
that
we
pulled
for
the
shore
and
went
to
bed
with
the
sinister
booming
under
our
bow
waking
in
the
gray
dawn
we
found
ourselves
at
the
mouth
of
the
niobrara
river
though
a
small
stream
compared
with
the
missouri
so
great
is
its
speed
and
so
tremendous
the
impact
of
its
flood
that
the
mightier
but
less
impetuous
missouri
is
driven
back
a
quarter
of
a
mile
reaching
springfield
twelve
miles
below
before
breakfast
in
the
evening
we
lifted
yankton
out
of
a
cloud
of
flying
sand
the
next
day
vermilion
and
elk
point
dropped
behind
and
then
thirty
miles
of
the
two
thousand
remained
in
the
weird
hour
just
before
the
first
faint
streak
of
dawn
grows
out
of
dark
we
were
making
coffee
the
last
outdoor
coffee
of
the
year
oh
the
ambrosial
stuff
we
were
under
way
when
the
stars
paled
at
sunrise
the
smoke
of
sioux
city
was
waving
huge
ragged
arms
of
welcome
out
of
the
southeast
at
noon
we
landed
we
had
rowed
fourteen
hundred
miles
against
almost
continual
head
winds
in
a
month
and
we
had
finished
our
two
thousand
miles
in
two
months
it
was
hard
work
and
yet
the
clang
of
the
trolleys
the
rumble
of
the
drays
the
rushing
of
the
people
i
prefer
the
drifting
of
the
stars
the
wandering
of
the
moon
the
coming
and
going
of
the
sun
the
crooning
of
the
river
the
shout
of
the
big
manly
winds
the
boom
of
the
diving
beaver
in
the
night
i
never
felt
at
home
in
a
town
up
river
when
the
night
dropped
over
me
somehow
i
always
felt
comfortably
kindly
housed
towns
after
all
are
machines
to
facilitate
getting
psychically
lost
when
i
started
for
the
head
of
navigation
a
friend
asked
me
what
i
expected
to
find
on
the
trip
some
more
of
myself
i
answered
and
after
all
that
is
the
great
discovery
