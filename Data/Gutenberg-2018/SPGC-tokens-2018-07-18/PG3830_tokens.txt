preface
to

the
alleviations
of
monogamy
this
piece
is
not
an
argument
for
or
against
polygamy
it
is
a
clinical
study
of
how
the
thing
actually
occurs
among
quite
ordinary
people
innocent
of
all
unconventional
views
concerning
it
the
enormous
majority
of
cases
in
real
life
are
those
of
people
in
that
position
those
who
deliberately
and
conscientiously
profess
what
are
oddly
called
advanced
views
by
those
others
who
believe
them
to
be
retrograde
are
often
and
indeed
mostly
the
last
people
in
the
world
to
engage
in
unconventional
adventures
of
any
kind
not
only
because
they
have
neither
time
nor
disposition
for
them
but
because
the
friction
set
up
between
the
individual
and
the
community
by
the
expression
of
unusual
views
of
any
sort
is
quite
enough
hindrance
to
the
heretic
without
being
complicated
by
personal
scandals
thus
the
theoretic
libertine
is
usually
a
person
of
blameless
family
life
whilst
the
practical
libertine
is
mercilessly
severe
on
all
other
libertines
and
excessively
conventional
in
professions
of
social
principle
what
is
more
these
professions
are
not
hypocritical
they
are
for
the
most
part
quite
sincere
the
common
libertine
like
the
drunkard
succumbs
to
a
temptation
which
he
does
not
defend
and
against
which
he
warns
others
with
an
earnestness
proportionate
to
the
intensity
of
his
own
remorse
he
or
she
may
be
a
liar
and
a
humbug
pretending
to
be
better
than
the
detected
libertines
and
clamoring
for
their
condign
punishment
but
this
is
mere
no
reasonable
person
expects
the
burglar
to
confess
his
pursuits
or
to
refrain
from
joining
in
the
cry
of
stop
thief
when
the
police
get
on
the
track
of
another
burglar
if
society
chooses
to
penalize
candor
it
has
itself
to
thank
if
its
attack
is
countered
by
falsehood
the
clamorous
virtue
of
the
libertine
is
therefore
no
more
hypocritical
than
the
plea
of
not
guilty
which
is
allowed
to
every
criminal
but
one
result
is
that
the
theorists
who
write
most
sincerely
and
favorably
about
polygamy
know
least
about
it
and
the
practitioners
who
know
most
about
it
keep
their
knowledge
very
jealously
to
themselves
which
is
hardly
fair
to
the
practice
inaccessibility
of
the
facts
also
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
its
prevalence
a
practice
to
which
nobody
confesses
may
be
both
universal
and
unsuspected
just
as
a
virtue
which
everybody
is
expected
under
heavy
penalties
to
claim
may
have
no
existence
it
is
often
assumed
indeed
it
is
the
official
assumption
of
the
churches
and
the
divorce
courts
that
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
can
not
be
alone
together
innocently
and
that
is
manifest
blazing
nonsense
though
many
women
have
been
stoned
to
death
in
the
east
and
divorced
in
the
west
on
the
strength
of
it
on
the
other
hand
the
innocent
and
conventional
people
who
regard
the
gallant
adventures
as
crimes
of
so
horrible
a
nature
that
only
the
most
depraved
and
desperate
characters
engage
in
them
or
would
listen
to
advances
in
that
direction
without
raising
an
alarm
with
the
noisiest
indignation
are
clearly
examples
of
the
fact
that
most
sections
of
society
do
not
know
how
the
other
sections
live
industry
is
the
most
effective
check
on
gallantry
women
may
as
napoleon
said
be
the
occupation
of
the
idle
man
just
as
men
are
the
preoccupation
of
the
idle
woman
but
the
mass
of
mankind
is
too
busy
and
too
poor
for
the
long
and
expensive
sieges
which
the
professed
libertine
lays
to
virtue
still
wherever
there
is
idleness
or
even
a
reasonable
supply
of
elegant
leisure
there
is
a
good
deal
of
coquetry
and
philandering
it
is
so
much
pleasanter
to
dance
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
than
to
go
over
it
that
leisured
society
is
full
of
people
who
spend
a
great
part
of
their
lives
in
flirtation
and
conceal
nothing
but
the
humiliating
secret
that
they
have
never
gone
any
further
for
there
is
no
pleasing
people
in
the
matter
of
reputation
in
this
department
every
insult
is
a
flattery
every
testimonial
is
a
disparagement
joseph
is
despised
and
promoted
potiphar
wife
admired
and
condemned
in
short
you
are
never
on
solid
ground
until
you
get
away
from
the
subject
altogether
there
is
a
continual
and
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
natural
and
conventional
sides
of
the
case
between
spontaneous
human
relations
between
independent
men
and
women
on
the
one
hand
and
the
property
relation
between
husband
and
wife
on
the
other
not
to
mention
the
confusion
under
the
common
name
of
love
of
a
generous
natural
attraction
and
interest
with
the
murderous
jealousy
that
fastens
on
and
clings
to
its
mate
especially
a
hated
mate
as
a
tiger
fastens
on
a
carcase
and
the
confusion
is
natural
for
these
extremes
are
extremes
of
the
same
passion
and
most
cases
lie
somewhere
on
the
scale
between
them
and
are
so
complicated
by
ordinary
likes
and
dislikes
by
incidental
wounds
to
vanity
or
gratifications
of
it
and
by
class
feeling
that
a
will
be
jealous
of
b
and
not
of
c
and
will
tolerate
infidelities
on
the
part
of
d
whilst
being
furiously
angry
when
they
are
committed
by
the
convention
of
jealousy
that
jealousy
is
independent
of
sex
is
shown
by
its
intensity
in
children
and
by
the
fact
that
very
jealous
people
are
jealous
of
everybody
without
regard
to
relationship
or
sex
and
can
not
bear
to
hear
the
person
they
love
speak
favorably
of
anyone
under
any
circumstances
many
women
for
instance
are
much
more
jealous
of
their
husbands
mothers
and
sisters
than
of
unrelated
women
whom
they
suspect
him
of
fancying
but
it
is
seldom
possible
to
disentangle
the
two
passions
in
practice
besides
jealousy
is
an
inculcated
passion
forced
by
society
on
people
in
whom
it
would
not
occur
spontaneously
in
brieux
bourgeois
aux
champs
the
benevolent
hero
finds
himself
detested
by
the
neighboring
peasants
and
farmers
not
because
he
preserves
game
and
sets
mantraps
for
poachers
and
defends
his
legal
rights
over
his
land
to
the
extremest
point
of
unsocial
savagery
but
because
being
an
amiable
and
person
he
refuses
to
do
all
this
and
thereby
offends
and
disparages
the
sense
of
property
in
his
neighbors
the
same
thing
is
true
of
matrimonial
jealousy
the
man
who
does
not
at
least
pretend
to
feel
it
and
behave
as
badly
as
if
he
really
felt
it
is
despised
and
insulted
and
many
a
man
has
shot
or
stabbed
a
friend
or
been
shot
or
stabbed
by
him
in
a
duel
or
disgraced
himself
and
ruined
his
own
wife
in
a
divorce
scandal
against
his
conscience
against
his
instinct
and
to
the
destruction
of
his
home
solely
because
society
conspired
to
drive
him
to
keep
its
own
lower
morality
in
countenance
in
this
miserable
and
undignified
manner
morality
is
confused
in
such
matters
in
an
elegant
plutocracy
a
jealous
husband
is
regarded
as
a
boor
among
the
tradesmen
who
supply
that
plutocracy
with
its
meals
a
husband
who
is
not
jealous
and
refrains
from
assailing
his
rival
with
his
fists
is
regarded
as
a
ridiculous
contemptible
and
cowardly
cuckold
and
the
laboring
class
is
divided
into
the
respectable
section
which
takes
the
view
and
the
disreputable
section
which
enjoys
the
license
of
the
plutocracy
without
its
money
creeping
below
the
law
as
its
exemplars
prance
above
it
cutting
down
all
expenses
of
respectability
and
even
decency
and
frankly
accepting
squalor
and
disrepute
as
the
price
of
anarchic
the
conflict
between
malvolio
and
sir
toby
between
the
marquis
and
the
bourgeois
the
cavalier
and
the
puritan
the
ascetic
and
the
voluptuary
goes
on
continually
and
goes
on
not
only
between
class
and
class
and
individual
and
individual
but
in
the
selfsame
breast
in
a
series
of
reactions
and
revulsions
in
which
the
irresistible
becomes
the
unbearable
and
the
unbearable
the
irresistible
until
none
of
us
can
say
what
our
characters
really
are
in
this
respect
the
missing
data
of
a
scientific
natural
history
of
marriage
of
one
thing
i
am
persuaded
we
shall
never
attain
to
a
reasonable
healthy
public
opinion
on
sex
questions
until
we
offer
as
the
data
for
that
opinion
our
actual
conduct
and
our
real
thoughts
instead
of
a
moral
fiction
which
we
agree
to
call
virtuous
conduct
and
which
we
then
and
here
comes
in
the
mischief
pretend
is
our
conduct
and
our
thoughts
if
the
result
were
that
we
all
believed
one
another
to
be
better
than
we
really
are
there
would
be
something
to
be
said
for
it
but
the
actual
result
appears
to
be
a
monstrous
exaggeration
of
the
power
and
continuity
of
sexual
passion
the
whole
world
shares
the
fate
of
lucrezia
borgia
who
though
she
seems
on
investigation
to
have
been
quite
a
suitable
wife
for
a
modern
british
bishop
has
been
invested
by
the
popular
historical
imagination
with
all
the
extravagances
of
a
messalina
or
a
cenci
writers
of
belles
lettres
who
are
rash
enough
to
admit
that
their
whole
life
is
not
one
constant
preoccupation
with
adored
members
of
the
opposite
sex
and
who
even
countenance
la

that
very
few
people
would
ever
imagine
themselves
in

if
they
had
never
read
anything
about
it
are
gravely
declared
to
be
abnormal
or
physically
defective
by
critics
of
crushing
unadventurousness
and
domestication
french
authors
of
saintly
temperament
are
forced
to
include
in
their
retinue
countesses
of
ardent
complexion
with
whom
they
are
supposed
to
live
in
sin
sentimental
controversies
on
the
subject
are
endless
but
they
are
useless
because
nobody
tells
the
truth
rousseau
did
it
by
an
extraordinary
effort
aided
by
a
superhuman
faculty
for
human
natural
history
but
the
result
was
curiously
disconcerting
because
though
the
facts
were
so
conventionally
shocking
that
people
felt
that
they
ought
to
matter
a
great
deal
they
actually
mattered
very
little
and
even
at
that
everybody
pretends
not
to
believe
him
artificial
retribution
the
worst
of
that
is
that
busybodies
with
perhaps
rather
more
than
a
normal
taste
for
mischief
are
continually
trying
to
make
negligible
things
matter
as
much
in
fact
as
they
do
in
convention
by
deliberately
inflicting
injuries
sometimes
atrocious
injuries
on
the
parties
concerned
few
people
have
any
knowledge
of
the
savage
punishments
that
are
legally
inflicted
for
aberrations
and
absurdities
to
which
no
sanely
instructed
community
would
call
any
attention
we
create
an
artificial
morality
and
consequently
an
artificial
conscience
by
manufacturing
disastrous
consequences
for
events
which
left
to
themselves
would
do
very
little
harm
sometimes
not
any
and
be
forgotten
in
a
few
days
but
the
artificial
morality
is
not
therefore
to
be
condemned
offhand
in
many
cases
it
may
save
mischief
instead
of
making
it
for
example
though
the
hanging
of
a
murderer
is
the
duplication
of
a
murder
yet
it
may
be
less
murderous
than
leaving
the
matter
to
be
settled
by
blood
feud
or
vendetta
as
long
as
human
nature
insists
on
revenge
the
official
organization
and
satisfaction
of
revenge
by
the
state
may
be
also
its
minimization
the
mischief
begins
when
the
official
revenge
persists
after
the
passion
it
satisfies
has
died
out
of
the
race
stoning
a
woman
to
death
in
the
east
because
she
has
ventured
to
marry
again
after
being
deserted
by
her
husband
may
be
more
merciful
than
allowing
her
to
be
mobbed
to
death
but
the
official
stoning
or
burning
of
an
adulteress
in
the
west
would
be
an
atrocity
because
few
of
us
hate
an
adulteress
to
the
extent
of
desiring
such
a
penalty
or
of
being
prepared
to
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
if
it
were
withheld
now
what
applies
to
this
extreme
case
applies
also
in
due
degree
to
the
other
cases
offences
in
which
sex
is
concerned
are
often
needlessly
magnified
by
penalties
ranging
from
various
forms
of
social
ostracism
to
long
sentences
of
penal
servitude
which
would
be
seen
to
be
monstrously
disproportionate
to
the
real
feeling
against
them
if
the
removal
of
both
the
penalties
and
the
taboo
on
their
discussion
made
it
possible
for
us
to
ascertain
their
real
prevalence
and
estimation
fortunately
there
is
one
outlet
for
the
truth
we
are
permitted
to
discuss
in
jest
what
we
may
not
discuss
in
earnest
a
serious
comedy
about
sex
is
taboo
a
farcical
comedy
is
privileged
the
favorite
subject
of
farcical
comedy
the
little
piece
which
follows
this
preface
accordingly
takes
the
form
of
a
farcical
comedy
because
it
is
a
contribution
to
the
very
extensive
dramatic
literature
which
takes
as
its
special
department
the
gallantries
of
married
people
the
stage
has
been
preoccupied
by
such
affairs
for
centuries
not
only
in
the
jesting
vein
of
restoration
comedy
and
palais
royal
farce
but
in
the
more
tragically
turned
adulteries
of
the
parisian
school
which
dominated
the
stage
until
ibsen
put
them
out
of
countenance
and
relegated
them
to
their
proper
place
as
articles
of
commerce
their
continued
vogue
in
that
department
maintains
the
tradition
that
adultery
is
the
dramatic
subject
par
excellence
and
indeed
that
a
play
that
is
not
about
adultery
is
not
a
play
at
all
i
was
considered
a
heresiarch
of
the
most
extravagant
kind
when
i
expressed
my
opinion
at
the
outset
of
my
career
as
a
playwright
that
adultery
is
the
dullest
of
themes
on
the
stage
and
that
from
francesca
and
paolo
down
to
the
latest
guilty
couple
of
the
school
of
dumas
fils
the
romantic
adulterers
have
all
been
intolerable
bores
the
pseudo
sex
play
later
on
i
had
occasion
to
point
out
to
the
defenders
of
sex
as
the
proper
theme
of
drama
that
though
they
were
right
in
ranking
sex
as
an
intensely
interesting
subject
they
were
wrong
in
assuming
that
sex
is
an
indispensable
motive
in
popular
plays
the
plays
of
moliere
are
like
the
novels
of
the
victorian
epoch
or
don
quixote
as
nearly
sexless
as
anything
not
absolutely
inhuman
can
be
and
some
of
shakespear
plays
are
sexually
on
a
par
with
the
census
they
contain
women
as
well
as
men
and
that
is
all
this
had
to
be
admitted
but
it
was
still
assumed
that
the
plays
of
the
xix
century
parisian
school
are
in
contrast
with
the
sexless
masterpieces
saturated
with
sex
and
this
i
strenuously
denied
a
play
about
the
convention
that
a
man
should
fight
a
duel
or
come
to
fisticuffs
with
his
wife
lover
if
she
has
one
or
the
convention
that
he
should
strangle
her
like
othello
or
turn
her
out
of
the
house
and
never
see
her
or
allow
her
to
see
her
children
again
or
the
convention
that
she
should
never
be
spoken
to
again
by
any
decent
person
and
should
finally
drown
herself
or
the
convention
that
persons
involved
in
scenes
of
recrimination
or
confession
by
these
conventions
should
call
each
other
certain
abusive
names
and
describe
their
conduct
as
guilty
and
frail
and
so
on
all
these
may
provide
material
for
very
effective
plays
but
such
plays
are
not
dramatic
studies
of
sex
one
might
as
well
say
that
romeo
and
juliet
is
a
dramatic
study
of
pharmacy
because
the
catastrophe
is
brought
about
through
an
apothecary
duels
are
not
sex
divorce
cases
are
not
sex
the
trade
unionism
of
married
women
is
not
sex
only
the
most
insignificant
fraction
of
the
gallantries
of
married
people
produce
any
of
the
conventional
results
and
plays
occupied
wholly
with
the
conventional
results
are
therefore
utterly
unsatisfying
as
sex
plays
however
interesting
they
may
be
as
plays
of
intrigue
and
plot
puzzles
the
world
is
finding
this
out
rapidly
the
sunday
papers
which
in
the
days
when
they
appealed
almost
exclusively
to
the
lower
middle
class
were
crammed
with
police
intelligence
and
more
especially
with
divorce
and
murder
cases
now
lay
no
stress
on
them
and
police
papers
which
confined
themselves
entirely
to
such
matters
and
were
once
eagerly
read
have
perished
through
the
essential
dulness
of
their
topics
and
yet
the
interest
in
sex
is
stronger
than
ever
in
fact
the
literature
that
has
driven
out
the
journalism
of
the
divorce
courts
is
a
literature
occupied
with
sex
to
an
extent
and
with
an
intimacy
and
frankness
that
would
have
seemed
utterly
impossible
to
thackeray
or
dickens
if
they
had
been
told
that
the
change
would
complete
itself
within
fifty
years
of
their
own
time
art
and
morality
it
is
ridiculous
to
say
as
inconsiderate
amateurs
of
the
arts
do
that
art
has
nothing
to
do
with
morality
what
is
true
is
that
the
business
is
not
that
of
the
policeman
and
that
such
factitious
consequences
and
jobs
as
divorces
and
executions
and
the
detective
operations
that
lead
up
to
them
are
no
essential
part
of
life
though
like
poisons
and
buttered
slides
and
pokers
they
provide
material
for
plenty
of
thrilling
or
amusing
stories
suited
to
people
who
are
incapable
of
any
interest
in
psychology
but
the
fine
artists
must
keep
the
policeman
out
of
his
studies
of
sex
and
studies
of
crime
it
is
by
clinging
nervously
to
the
policeman
that
most
of
the
pseudo
sex
plays
convince
me
that
the
writers
have
either
never
had
any
serious
personal
experience
of
their
ostensible
subject
or
else
have
never
conceived
it
possible
that
the
stage
door
present
the
phenomena
of
sex
as
they
appear
in
nature
the
limits
of
stage
presentation
but
the
stage
presents
much
more
shocking
phenomena
than
those
of
sex
there
is
of
course
a
sense
in
which
you
can
not
present
sex
on
the
stage
just
as
you
can
not
present
murder
macbeth
must
no
more
really
kill
duncan
than
he
must
himself
be
really
slain
by
macduff
but
the
feelings
of
a
murderer
can
be
expressed
in
a
certain
artistic
convention
and
a
carefully
prearranged
sword
exercise
can
be
gone
through
with
sufficient
pretence
of
earnestness
to
be
accepted
by
the
willing
imaginations
of
the
younger
spectators
as
a
desperate
combat
the
tragedy
of
love
has
been
presented
on
the
stage
in
the
same
way
in
tristan
and
isolde
the
curtain
does
not
as
in
romeo
and
juliet
rise
with
the
lark
the
whole
night
of
love
is
played
before
the
spectators
the
lovers
do
not
discuss
marriage
in
an
elegantly
sentimental
way
they
utter
the
visions
and
feelings
that
come
to
lovers
at
the
supreme
moments
of
their
love
totally
forgetting
that
there
are
such
things
in
the
world
as
husbands
and
lawyers
and
duelling
codes
and
theories
of
sin
and
notions
of
propriety
and
all
the
other
irrelevancies
which
provide
hackneyed
and
bloodless
material
for
our
plays
of
passion
pruderies
of
the
french
stage
to
all
stage
presentations
there
are
limits
if
macduff
were
to
stab
macbeth
the
spectacle
would
be
intolerable
and
even
the
pretence
which
we
allow
on
our
stage
is
ridiculously
destructive
to
the
illusion
of
the
scene
yet
pugilists
and
gladiators
will
actually
fight
and
kill
in
public
without
sham
even
as
a
spectacle
for
money
but
no
sober
couple
of
lovers
of
any
delicacy
could
endure
to
be
watched
we
in
england
accustomed
to
consider
the
french
stage
much
more
licentious
than
the
british
are
always
surprised
and
puzzled
when
we
learn
as
we
may
do
any
day
if
we
come
within
reach
of
such
information
that
french
actors
are
often
scandalized
by
what
they
consider
the
indecency
of
the
english
stage
and
that
french
actresses
who
desire
a
greater
license
in
appealing
to
the
sexual
instincts
than
the
french
stage
allows
them
learn
and
establish
themselves
on
the
english
stage
the
german
and
russian
stages
are
in
the
same
relation
to
the
french
and
perhaps
more
or
less
all
the
latin
stages
the
reason
is
that
partly
from
a
want
of
respect
for
the
theatre
partly
from
a
sort
of
respect
for
art
in
general
which
moves
them
to
accord
moral
privileges
to
artists
partly
from
the
very
objectionable
tradition
that
the
realm
of
art
is
alsatia
and
the
contemplation
of
works
of
art
a
holiday
from
the
burden
of
virtue
partly
because
french
prudery
does
not
attach
itself
to
the
same
points
of
behavior
as
british
prudery
and
has
a
different
code
of
the
mentionable
and
the
unmentionable
and
for
many
other
reasons
the
french
tolerate
plays
which
are
never
performed
in
england
until
they
have
been
spoiled
by
a
process
of
bowdlerization
yet
french
taste
is
more
fastidious
than
ours
as
to
the
exhibition
and
treatment
on
the
stage
of
the
physical
incidents
of
sex
on
the
french
stage
a
kiss
is
as
obvious
a
convention
as
the
thrust
under
the
arm
by
which
macduff
runs
macbeth
through
it
is
even
a
purposely
unconvincing
convention
the
actors
rather
insisting
that
it
shall
be
impossible
for
any
spectator
to
mistake
a
stage
kiss
for
a
real
one
in
england
on
the
contrary
realism
is
carried
to
the
point
at
which
nobody
except
the
two
performers
can
perceive
that
the
caress
is
not
genuine
and
here
the
english
stage
is
certainly
in
the
right
for
whatever
question
there
arises
as
to
what
incidents
are
proper
for
representation
on
the
stage
or
not
my
experience
as
a
playgoer
leaves
me
in
no
doubt
that
once
it
is
decided
to
represent
an
incident
it
will
be
offensive
no
matter
whether
it
be
a
prayer
or
a
kiss
unless
it
is
presented
with
a
convincing
appearance
of
sincerity
our
disillusive
scenery
for
example
the
main
objection
to
the
use
of
illusive
scenery
in
most
modern
plays
scenery
is
not
illusive
everything
visible
is
as
real
as
in
your
drawing
room
at
home
is
that
it
is
unconvincing
whilst
the
imaginary
scenery
with
which
the
audience
provides
a
platform
or
tribune
like
the
elizabethan
stage
or
the
greek
stage
used
by
sophocles
is
quite
convincing
in
fact
the
more
scenery
you
have
the
less
illusion
you
produce
the
wise
playwright
when
he
can
not
get
absolute
reality
of
presentation
goes
to
the
other
extreme
and
aims
at
atmosphere
and
suggestion
of
mood
rather
than
at
direct
simulative
illusion
the
theatre
as
i
first
knew
it
was
a
place
of
wings
and
flats
which
destroyed
both
atmosphere
and
illusion
this
was
tolerated
and
even
intensely
enjoyed
but
not
in
the
least
because
nothing
better
was
possible
for
all
the
devices
employed
in
the
productions
of
granville
barker
or
max
reinhardt
or
the
moscow
art
theatre
were
equally
available
for
colley
cibber
and
garrick
except
the
intensity
of
our
artificial
light
when
garrick
played
richard
ii
in
slashed
trunk
hose
and
plumes
it
was
not
because
he
believed
that
the
plantagenets
dressed
like
that
or
because
the
costumes
could
not
have
made
him
a
xv
century
dress
as
easily
as
a
nondescript
combination
of
the
state
robes
of
george
iii
with
such
scraps
of
older
fashions
as
seemed
to
playgoers
for
some
reason
to
be
romantic
the
charm
of
the
theatre
in
those
days
was
its
makebelieve
it
has
that
charm
still
not
only
for
the
amateurs
who
are
happiest
when
they
are
most
unnatural
and
impossible
and
absurd
but
for
audiences
as
well
i
have
seen
performances
of
my
own
plays
which
were
to
me
far
wilder
burlesques
than
sheridan
critic
or
buckingham
rehearsal
yet
they
have
produced
sincere
laughter
and
tears
such
as
the
most
finished
metropolitan
productions
have
failed
to
elicit
fielding
was
entirely
right
when
he
represented
partridge
as
enjoying
intensely
the
performance
of
the
king
in
hamlet
because
anybody
could
see
that
the
king
was
an
actor
and
resenting
garrick
hamlet
because
it
might
have
been
a
real
man
yet
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
portraits
of
garrick
to
see
that
his
performances
would
nowadays
seem
almost
as
extravagantly
stagey
as
his
costumes
in
our
day
calve
intensely
real
carmen
never
pleased
the
mob
as
much
as
the
obvious
fancy
ball
masquerading
of
suburban
young
ladies
in
the
same
character
holding
the
mirror
up
to
nature
theatrical
art
begins
as
the
holding
up
to
nature
of
a
distorting
mirror
in
this
phase
it
pleases
people
who
are
childish
enough
to
believe
that
they
can
see
what
they
look
like
and
what
they
are
when
they
look
at
a
true
mirror
naturally
they
think
that
a
true
mirror
can
teach
them
nothing
only
by
giving
them
back
some
monstrous
image
can
the
mirror
amuse
them
or
terrify
them
it
is
not
until
they
grow
up
to
the
point
at
which
they
learn
that
they
know
very
little
about
themselves
and
that
they
do
not
see
themselves
in
a
true
mirror
as
other
people
see
them
that
they
become
consumed
with
curiosity
as
to
what
they
really
are
like
and
begin
to
demand
that
the
stage
shall
be
a
mirror
of
such
accuracy
and
intensity
of
illumination
that
they
shall
be
able
to
get
glimpses
of
their
real
selves
in
it
and
also
learn
a
little
how
they
appear
to
other
people
for
audiences
of
this
highly
developed
class
sex
can
no
longer
be
ignored
or
conventionalized
or
distorted
by
the
playwright
who
makes
the
mirror
the
old
sentimental
extravagances
and
the
old
grossnesses
are
of
no
further
use
to
him
don
giovanni
and
zerlina
are
not
gross
tristan
and
isolde
are
not
extravagant
or
sentimental
they
say
and
do
nothing
that
you
can
not
bear
to
hear
and
see
and
yet
they
give
you
the
one
pair
briefly
and
slightly
and
the
other
fully
and
deeply
what
passes
in
the
minds
of
lovers
the
love
depicted
may
be
that
of
a
philosophic
adventurer
tempting
an
ignorant
country
girl
or
of
a
tragically
serious
poet
entangled
with
a
woman
of
noble
capacity
in
a
passion
which
has
become
for
them
the
reality
of
the
whole
universe
no
matter
the
thing
is
dramatized
and
dramatized
directly
not
talked
about
as
something
that
happened
before
the
curtain
rose
or
that
will
happen
after
it
falls
farcical
comedy
shirking
its
subject
now
if
all
this
can
be
done
in
the
key
of
tragedy
and
philosophic
comedy
it
can
i
have
always
contended
be
done
in
the
key
of
farcical
comedy
and
overruled
is
a
trifling
experiment
in
that
manner
conventional
farcical
comedies
are
always
finally
tedious
because
the
heart
of
them
the
inevitable
conjugal
infidelity
is
always
evaded
even
its
consequences
are
evaded
granville
barker
has
pointed
out
rightly
that
if
the
third
acts
of
our
farcical
comedies
dared
to
describe
the
consequences
that
would
follow
from
the
first
and
second
in
real
life
they
would
end
as
squalid
tragedies
and
in
my
opinion
they
would
be
greatly
improved
thereby
even
as
entertainments
for
i
have
never
seen
a
farcical
comedy
without
being
bored
and
tired
by
the
third
act
and
observing
that
the
rest
of
the
audience
were
in
the
same
condition
though
they
were
not
vigilantly
introspective
enough
to
find
that
out
and
were
apt
to
blame
one
another
especially
the
husbands
and
wives
for
their
crossness
but
it
is
happily
by
no
means
true
that
conjugal
infidelities
always
produce
tragic
consequences
or
that
they
need
produce
even
the
unhappiness
which
they
often
do
produce
besides
the
more
momentous
the
consequences
the
more
interesting
become
the
impulses
and
imaginations
and
reasonings
if
any
of
the
people
who
disregard
them
if
i
had
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
the
ghost
of
an
executed
murderer
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
begin
to
tell
me
eagerly
about
his
trial
with
the
names
of
the
distinguished
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
honored
him
with
their
presence
on
that
occasion
and
then
about
his
execution
all
of
which
would
bore
me
exceedingly
i
should
say
my
dear
sir
such
manufactured
ceremonies
do
not
interest
me
in
the
least
i
know
how
a
man
is
tried
and
how
he
is
hanged
i
should
have
had
you
killed
in
a
much
less
disgusting
hypocritical
and
unfriendly
manner
if
the
matter
had
been
in
my
hands
what
i
want
to
know
about
is
the
murder
how
did
you
feel
when
you
committed
it
why
did
you
do
it
what
did
you
say
to
yourself
about
it
if
like
most
murderers
you
had
not
been
hanged
would
you
have
committed
other
murders
did
you
really
dislike
the
victim
or
did
you
want
his
money
or
did
you
murder
a
person
whom
you
did
not
dislike
and
from
whose
death
you
had
nothing
to
gain
merely
for
the
sake
of
murdering
if
so
can
you
describe
the
charm
to
me
does
it
come
upon
you
periodically
or
is
it
chronic
has
curiosity
anything
to
do
with
it
i
would
ply
him
with
all
manner
of
questions
to
find
out
what
murder
is
really
like
and
i
should
not
be
satisfied
until
i
had
realized
that
i
too
might
commit
a
murder
or
else
that
there
is
some
specific
quality
present
in
a
murderer
and
lacking
in
me
and
if
so
what
that
quality
is
in
just
the
same
way
i
want
the
unfaithful
husband
or
the
unfaithful
wife
in
a
farcical
comedy
not
to
bother
me
with
their
divorce
cases
or
the
stratagems
they
employ
to
avoid
a
divorce
case
but
to
tell
me
how
and
why
married
couples
are
unfaithful
i
do
want
to
hear
the
lies
they
tell
one
another
to
conceal
what
they
have
done
but
the
truths
they
tell
one
another
when
they
have
to
face
what
they
have
done
without
concealment
or
excuse
no
doubt
prudent
and
considerate
people
conceal
such
adventures
when
they
can
from
those
who
are
most
likely
to
be
wounded
by
them
but
it
is
not
to
be
presumed
that
when
found
out
they
necessarily
disgrace
themselves
by
irritating
lies
and
transparent
subterfuges
my
playlet
which
i
offer
as
a
model
to
all
future
writers
of
farcical
comedy
may
now
i
hope
be
read
without
shock
i
may
just
add
that
sibthorpe
juno
view
that
morality
demands
not
that
we
should
behave
morally
an
impossibility
to
our
sinful
nature
but
that
we
shall
not
attempt
to
defend
our
immoralities
is
a
standard
view
in
england
and
was
advanced
in
all
seriousness
by
an
earnest
and
distinguished
british
moralist
shortly
after
the
first
performance
of

my
objection
to
that
aspect
of
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
is
that
no
necessary
and
inevitable
operation
of
human
nature
can
reasonably
be
regarded
as
sinful
at
all
and
that
a
morality
which
assumes
the
contrary
is
an
absurd
morality
and
can
be
kept
in
countenance
only
by
hypocrisy
when
people
were
ashamed
of
sanitary
problems
and
refused
to
face
them
leaving
them
to
solve
themselves
clandestinely
in
dirt
and
secrecy
the
solution
arrived
at
was
the
black
death
a
similar
policy
as
to
sex
problems
has
solved
itself
by
an
even
worse
plague
than
the
black
death
and
the
remedy
for
that
is
not
salvarsan
but
sound
moral
hygiene
the
first
foundation
of
which
is
the
discontinuance
of
our
habit
of
telling
not
only
the
comparatively
harmless
lies
that
we
know
we
ought
not
to

ruinous
lies

we
foolishly
think
we
ought

dandyism
in
the
arrangement
of
his
hair
as
any
man
who
is
not
a
professional
artist
can
afford
to
in
england
he
is
obviously
very
much
in
love
with
the
lady
and
is
in
fact
yielding
to
an
irresistible
impulse
to
throw
his
arms
around
her
the
lady
do
oh
do
be
horrid
please
lunn
she
rises
from
the
lounge
and
retreats
behind
it
promise
me
you
wo
be
horrid
gregory
lunn
i
not
being
horrid
juno
i
not
going
to
be
horrid
i
love
you
that
all
i
extraordinarily
happy
juno
you
will
really
be
good
gregory
i
be
whatever
you
wish
me
to
be
i
tell
you
i
love
you
i
love
loving
you
i
do
want
to
be
tired
and
sorry
as
i
should
be
if
i
were
to
be
horrid
i
do
want
you
to
be
tired
and
sorry
do
come
and
sit
down
again
juno
coming
back
to
her
seat
you
sure
you
do
want
anything
you
ought
to
gregory
quite
sure
i
only
want
you
she
recoils
do
be
alarmed
i
like
wanting
you
as
long
as
i
have
a
want
i
have
a
reason
for
living
satisfaction
is
death
juno
yes
but
the
impulse
to
commit
suicide
is
sometimes
irresistible
gregory
not
with
you
juno
what
gregory
oh
it
sounds
uncomplimentary
but
it
is
really
do
you
know
why
half
the
couples
who
find
themselves
situated
as
we
are
now
behave
horridly
juno
because
they
ca
help
it
if
they
let
things
go
too
far
gregory
not
a
bit
of
it
it
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
and
no
other
way
of
entertaining
each
other
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
alone
with
a
woman
who
has
little
beauty
and
less
conversation
what
is
a
man
to
do
she
ca
talk
interestingly
and
if
he
talks
that
way
himself
she
does
understand
him
he
ca
look
at
her
if
he
does
he
only
finds
out
that
she
is
beautiful
before
the
end
of
five
minutes
they
are
both
hideously
bored
there
only
one
thing
that
can
save
the
situation
and
that
what
you
call
being
horrid
with
a
beautiful
witty
kind
woman
there
no
time
for
such
follies
it
so
delightful
to
look
at
her
to
listen
to
her
voice
to
hear
all
she
has
to
say
that
nothing
else
happens
that
is
why
the
woman
who
is
supposed
to
have
a
thousand
lovers
seldom
has
one
whilst
the
stupid
graceless
animals
of
women
have
dozens
juno
i
wonder
it
quite
true
that
when
one
feels
in
danger
one
talks
like
mad
to
stave
it
off
even
when
one
does
quite
want
to
stave
it
off
gregory
one
never
does
quite
want
to
stave
it
off
danger
is
delicious
but
death
is
we
court
the
danger
but
the
real
delight
is
in
escaping
after
all
juno
i
do
think
we
talk
about
it
any
more
danger
is
all
very
well
when
you
do
escape
but
sometimes
one
does
i
tell
you
frankly
i
do
feel
as
safe
as
you
do
if
you
really
do
gregory
but
surely
you
can
do
as
you
please
without
injuring
anyone
juno
that
is
the
whole
secret
of
your
extraordinary
charm
for
me
juno
i
do
understand
gregory
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
to
explain
but
the
root
of
the
matter
is
that
i
am
what
people
call
a
good
man
juno
i
thought
so
until
you
began
making
love
to
me
gregory
but
you
knew
i
loved
you
all
along
juno
yes
of
course
but
i
depended
on
you
not
to
tell
me
so
because
i
thought
you
were
good
your
blurting
it
out
spoilt
it
and
it
was
wicked
besides
gregory
not
at
all
you
see
it
a
great
many
years
since
i
been
able
to
allow
myself
to
fall
in
love
i
know
lots
of
charming
women
but
the
worst
of
it
is
they
all
married
women
do
become
charming
to
my
taste
until
they
fully
developed
and
by
that
time
if
they
really
nice
they
snapped
up
and
married
and
then
because
i
am
a
good
man
i
have
to
place
a
limit
to
my
regard
for
them
i
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
gain
friendship
and
even
very
warm
affection
from
them
but
my
loyalty
to
their
husbands
and
their
hearths
and
their
happiness
obliges
me
to
draw
a
line
and
not
overstep
it
of
course
i
value
such
affectionate
regard
very
highly
indeed
i
am
surrounded
with
women
who
are
most
dear
to
me
but
every
one
of
them
has
a
post
sticking
up
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
with
the
inscription
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
how
we
all
loathe
that
notice
in
every
lovely
garden
in
every
dell
full
of
primroses
on
every
fair
hillside
we
meet
that
confounded
board
and
there
is
always
a
gamekeeper
round
the
corner
but
what
is
that
to
the
horror
of
meeting
it
on
every
beautiful
woman
and
knowing
that
there
is
a
husband
round
the
corner
i
have
had
this
accursed
board
standing
between
me
and
every
dear
and
desirable
woman
until
i
thought
i
had
lost
the
power
of
letting
myself
fall
really
and
wholeheartedly
in
love
juno
was
there
a
widow
gregory
no
widows
are
extraordinarily
scarce
in
modern
society
husbands
live
longer
than
they
used
to
and
even
when
they
do
die
their
widows
have
a
string
of
names
down
for
their
next
juno
well
what
about
the
young
girls
gregory
oh
who
cares
for
young
girls
they
sympathetic
beginners
they
do
attract
me
i
afraid
of
them
juno
that
the
correct
thing
to
say
to
a
woman
of
my
age
but
it
does
explain
why
you
seem
to
have
put
your
scruples
in
your
pocket
when
you
met
me
gregory
surely
that
quite
clear
i
juno
no
please
do
explain
i
do
want
to
know
i
take
your
word
for
it
besides
it
does
matter
now
our
voyage
is
over
and
i
start
for
the
north
to
my
poor
father
place
gregory
surprised
your
poor
father
i
thought
he
was
alive
juno
so
he
is
what
made
you
think
he
was
gregory
you
said
your
poor
father
juno
oh
that
a
trick
of
mine
rather
a
silly
trick
i
suppose
but
there
something
pathetic
to
me
about
men
i
find
myself
calling
them
poor
when
there
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
them
gregory
who
has
listened
in
growing
alarm
but
i
is
wa
oh
lord
juno
what
the
matter
gregory
nothing
juno
nothing
rising
anxiously
nonsense
you
gregory
no
it
was
something
about
your
late
husband
juno
my
late
husband
what
do
you
mean
clutching
him
do
tell
me
he
dead
gregory
rising
equally
appalled
do
tell
me
he
alive
juno
oh
do
frighten
me
like
this
of
course
alive
unless
you
heard
anything
gregory
the
first
day
we
met
on
the
boat
you
spoke
to
me
of
your
poor
dear
husband
juno
releasing
him
quite
reassured
is
that
all
gregory
well
afterwards
you
called
him
poor
tops
always
poor
tops
our
poor
dear
tops
what
could
i
think
juno
sitting
down
again
i
wish
you
had
given
me
such
a
shock
about
him
for
i
have
been
treating
him
at
all
well
neither
have
you
gregory
relapsing
into
his
seat
overwhelmed
and
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
not
a
widow
juno
gracious
no
i
not
in
black
gregory
then
i
have
been
behaving
like
a
blackguard
i
have
broken
my
promise
to
my
mother
i
shall
never
have
an
easy
conscience
again
juno
i
sorry
i
thought
you
knew
gregory
you
thought
i
was
a
libertine
juno
no
of
course
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
if
i
had
thought
that
i
thought
you
liked
me
but
that
you
knew
and
would
be
good
gregory
stretching
his
hands
towards
her
breast
i
thought
the
burden
of
being
good
had
fallen
from
my
soul
at
last
i
saw
nothing
there
but
a
bosom
to
rest
on
the
bosom
of
a
lovely
woman
of
whom
i
could
dream
without
guilt
what
do
i
see
now
juno
just
what
you
saw
before
gregory
despairingly
no
no
juno
what
else
gregory
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
juno
they
wo
if
they
hold
their
tongues
do
be
such
a
coward
my
husband
wo
eat
you
gregory
i
not
afraid
of
your
husband
i
afraid
of
my
conscience
juno
losing
patience
well
i
do
consider
myself
at
all
a
badly
behaved
woman
for
nothing
has
passed
between
us
that
was
not
perfectly
nice
and
friendly
but
really
to
hear
a
man
talking
about
promises
to
his
mother
gregory
interrupting
her
yes
yes
i
know
all
about
that
it
not
romantic
it
not
don
juan
it
not
advanced
but
we
feel
it
all
the
same
it
far
deeper
in
our
blood
and
bones
than
all
the
romantic
stuff
my
father
got
into
a
scandal
once
that
was
why
my
mother
made
me
promise
never
to
make
love
to
a
married
woman
and
now
i
done
it
i
ca
feel
honest
do
pretend
to
despise
me
or
laugh
at
me
you
feel
it
too
you
said
just
now
that
your
own
conscience
was
uneasy
when
you
thought
of
your
husband
what
must
it
be
when
you
think
of
my
wife
juno
rising
aghast
your
wife
you
do
dare
sit
there
and
tell
me
coolly
that
you
a
married
man
gregory
i
never
led
you
to
believe
i
was
unmarried
juno
oh
you
never
gave
me
the
faintest
hint
that
you
had
a
wife
gregory
i
did
indeed
i
discussed
things
with
you
that
only
married
people
really
understand
juno
oh
gregory
i
thought
it
the
most
delicate
way
of
letting
you
know
juno
well
you
are
a
daisy
i
must
say
i
suppose
that
vulgar
but
really
really
you
and
your
goodness
however
now
we
found
one
another
out
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
will
you
please
go
gregory
rising
slowly
i
ought
to
go
juno
well
go
gregory
yes
er
he
tries
to
go
i
i
somehow
ca
he
sits
down
again
helplessly
my
conscience
is
active
my
will
is
paralyzed
this
is
really
dreadful
would
you
mind
ringing
the
bell
and
asking
them
to
throw
me
out
you
ought
to
you
know
juno
what
make
a
scandal
in
the
face
of
the
whole
hotel
certainly
not
do
be
a
fool
gregory
yes
but
i
ca
go
juno
then
i
can
goodbye
gregory
clinging
to
her
hand
can
you
really
juno
of
course
i
she
wavers
oh
dear
they
contemplate
one
another
helplessly
i
ca
she
sinks
on
the
lounge
hand
in
hand
with
him
gregory
for
heaven
sake
pull
yourself
together
it
a
question
of
juno
dragging
her
hand
away
and
retreating
to
the
end
of
the
chesterfield
no
it
a
question
of
distance
is
all
very
well
two
or
three
yards
off
or
on
a
ship
with
everybody
looking
on
do
come
any
nearer
gregory
this
is
a
ghastly
business
i
want
to
go
away
and
i
ca
juno
i
think
you
ought
to
go
he
makes
an
effort
and
she
adds
quickly
but
if
you
try
i
shall
grab
you
round
the
neck
and
disgrace
myself
i
implore
you
to
sit
still
and
be
nice
gregory
i
implore
you
to
run
away
i
believe
i
can
trust
myself
to
let
you
go
for
your
own
sake
but
it
will
break
my
heart
juno
i
do
want
to
break
your
heart
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
your
sitting
here
alone
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
sitting
alone
myself
somewhere
else
it
so
senseless
so
ridiculous
when
we
might
be
so
happy
i
do
want
to
be
wicked
or
coarse
but
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
do
want
to
be
affectionate
and
human
gregory
i
ought
to
draw
a
line
juno
so
you
shall
dear
tell
me
do
you
really
like
me
i
mean
love
me
you
might
love
the
housemaid
gregory
vehemently
no
juno
oh
yes
you
might
and
what
does
that
matter
anyhow
are
you
really
fond
of
me
are
we
friends
comrades
would
you
be
sorry
if
i
died
gregory
shrinking
oh
do
juno
or
was
it
the
usual
aimless
man
lark
a
mere
shipboard
flirtation
gregory
oh
no
no
nothing
half
so
bad
so
vulgar
so
wrong
i
assure
you
i
only
meant
to
be
agreeable
it
grew
on
me
before
i
noticed
it
juno
and
you
were
glad
to
let
it
grow
gregory
i
let
it
grow
because
the
board
was
not
up
juno
bother
the
board
i
am
just
as
fond
of
sibthorpe
as
gregory
sibthorpe
juno
sibthorpe
is
my
husband
christian
name
i
ought
to
call
him
tops
to
you
now
gregory
chuckling
it
sounded
like
something
to
drink
but
i
have
no
right
to
laugh
at
him
my
christian
name
is
gregory
which
sounds
like
a
powder
juno
chilled
that
is
so
like
a
man
i
offer
you
my
warmest
friendliest
feeling
and
you
think
of
nothing
but
a
silly
joke
a
quip
like
that
makes
you
forget
me
gregory
forget
you
oh
if
i
only
could
juno
if
you
could
would
you
gregory
burying
his
shamed
face
in
his
hands
no
i
die
first
oh
i
hate
myself
juno
i
glory
in
myself
it
so
jolly
to
be
reckless
can
a
man
be
reckless
i
wonder
gregory
straightening
himself
desperately
no
i
not
reckless
i
know
what
i
doing
my
conscience
is
awake
oh
where
is
the
intoxication
of
love
the
delirium
the
madness
that
makes
a
man
think
the
world
well
lost
for
the
woman
he
adores
i
do
think
anything
of
the
sort
i
see
that
it
not
worth
it
i
know
that
it
wrong
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
cooler
more
businesslike
juno
opening
her
arms
to
him
but
you
ca
resist
me
gregory
i
must
i
ought
throwing
himself
into
her
arms
oh
my
darling
my
treasure
we
shall
be
sorry
for
this
juno
we
can
forgive
ourselves
could
we
forgive
ourselves
if
we
let
this
moment
slip
gregory
i
protest
to
the
last
i
against
this
i
have
been
pushed
over
a
precipice
i
innocent
this
wild
joy
this
exquisite
tenderness
this
ascent
into
heaven
can
thrill
me
to
the
uttermost
fibre
of
my
heart
with
a
gesture
of
ecstasy
she
hides
her
face
on
his
shoulder
but
it
ca
subdue
my
mind
or
corrupt
my
conscience
which
still
shouts
to
the
skies
that
i
not
a
willing
party
to
this
outrageous
conduct
i
repudiate
the
bliss
with
which
you
are
filling
me
juno
never
mind
your
conscience
tell
me
how
happy
you
are
gregory
no
i
recall
you
to
your
duty
but
oh
i
will
give
you
my
life
with
both
hands
if
you
can
tell
me
that
you
feel
for
me
one
millionth
part
of
what
i
feel
for
you
now
juno
oh
yes
yes
be
satisfied
with
that
ask
for
no
more
let
me
go
gregory
i
ca
i
have
no
will
something
stronger
than
either
of
us
is
in
command
here
nothing
on
earth
or
in
heaven
can
part
us
now
you
know
that
do
you
juno
oh
do
make
me
say
it
of
course
i
know
nothing
not
life
nor
death
nor
shame
nor
anything
can
part
us
a
male
voice
in
the
corridor
all
right
this
must
be
it
the
two
recover
with
a
violent
start
release
one
another
and
spring
back
to
opposite
sides
of
the
lounge
gregory
that
did
it
juno
in
a
thrilling
whisper
sh
sh
sh
that
was
my
voice
gregory
impossible
it
only
our
guilty
fancy
a
woman
voice
this
is
the
way
to
the
lounge
i
know
it
gregory
great
heaven
we
both
mad
that
my
wife
voice
juno
ridiculous
oh
we
dreaming
it
all
we
the
door
opens
and
sibthorpe
juno
appears
in
the
roseate
glow
of
the
corridor
which
happens
to
be
papered
in
pink
with
lunn
like
tannhauser
in
the
hill
of
venus
he
is
a
fussily
energetic
little
man
who
gives
himself
an
air
of
gallantry
by
greasing
the
points
of
his
moustaches
and
dressing
very
carefully
she
is
a
tall
imposing
handsome
languid
woman
with
flashing
dark
eyes
and
long
lashes
they
make
for
the
chesterfield
not
noticing
the
two
palpitating
figures
blotted
against
the
walls
in
the
gloom
on
either
side
the
figures
flit
away
noiselessly
through
the
window
and
disappear
juno
officiously
ah
here
we
are
he
leads
the
way
to
the
sofa
sit
down
i
sure
you
tired
she
sits
that
right
he
sits
beside
her
on
her
left
hullo
he
rises
this
sofa
quite
warm
lunn
bored
is
it
i
do
notice
it
i
expect
the
sun
been
on
it
juno
i
felt
it
quite
distinctly
i
more
thinly
clad
than
you
he
sits
down
again
and
proceeds
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
what
a
relief
to
get
off
the
ship
and
have
a
private
room
that
the
worst
of
a
ship
you
under
observation
all
the
time
lunn
but
why
not
juno
well
of
course
there
no
reason
at
least
i
suppose
not
but
you
know
part
of
the
romance
of
a
journey
is
that
a
man
keeps
imagining
that
something
might
happen
and
he
ca
do
that
if
there
are
a
lot
of
people
about
and
it
simply
ca
happen
lunn
juno
romance
is
all
very
well
on
board
ship
but
when
your
foot
touches
the
soil
of
england
there
an
end
of
it
juno
no
believe
me
that
a
foreigner
mistake
we
are
the
most
romantic
people
in
the
world
we
english
why
my
very
presence
here
is
a
romance
lunn
faintly
ironical
indeed
juno
yes
you
guessed
of
course
that
i
a
married
man
lunn
oh
that
all
right
i
a
married
woman
juno
thank
heaven
for
that
to
my
english
mind
passion
is
not
real
passion
without
guilt
i
am
a
man
lunn
i
ca
help
it
the
tragedy
of
my
life
is
that
i
married
when
quite
young
a
woman
whom
i
could
help
being
very
fond
of
i
longed
for
a
guilty
passion
for
the
real
thing
the
wicked
thing
and
yet
i
could
care
twopence
for
any
other
woman
when
my
wife
was
about
year
after
year
went
by
i
felt
my
youth
slipping
away
without
ever
having
had
a
romance
in
my
life
for
marriage
is
all
very
well
but
it
romance
there
nothing
wrong
in
it
you
see
lunn
poor
man
how
you
must
have
suffered
juno
no
that
was
what
was
so
tame
about
it
i
wanted
to
suffer
you
get
so
sick
of
being
happily
married
it
always
the
happy
marriages
that
break
up
at
last
my
wife
and
i
agreed
that
we
ought
to
take
a
holiday
lunn
had
you
holidays
every
year
juno
oh
the
seaside
and
so
on
that
not
what
we
meant
we
meant
a
holiday
from
one
another
lunn
how
very
odd
juno
she
said
it
was
an
excellent
idea
that
domestic
felicity
was
making
us
perfectly
idiotic
that
she
wanted
a
holiday
too
so
we
agreed
to
go
round
the
world
in
opposite
directions
i
started
for
suez
on
the
day
she
sailed
for
new
york
lunn
suddenly
becoming
attentive
that
precisely
what
gregory
and
i
did
now
i
wonder
did
he
want
a
holiday
from
me
what
he
said
was
that
he
wanted
the
delight
of
meeting
me
after
a
long
absence
juno
could
anything
be
more
romantic
than
that
would
anyone
else
than
an
englishman
have
thought
of
it
i
daresay
my
temperament
seems
tame
to
your
boiling
southern
blood
lunn
my
what
juno
your
southern
blood
do
you
remember
how
you
told
me
that
night
in
the
saloon
when
i
sang
farewell
and
adieu
to
you
dear
spanish
ladies
that
you
were
by
birth
a
lady
of
spain
your
splendid
andalusian
beauty
speaks
for
itself
lunn
stuff
i
was
born
in
gibraltar
my
father
was
captain
jenkins
in
the
artillery
juno
ardently
it
is
climate
and
not
race
that
determines
the
temperament
the
fiery
sun
of
spain
blazed
on
your
cradle
and
it
rocked
to
the
roar
of
british
cannon
lunn
what
eloquence
it
reminds
me
of
my
husband
when
he
was
in
love
before
we
were
married
are
you
in
love
juno
yes
and
with
the
same
woman
lunn
well
of
course
i
did
suppose
you
were
in
love
with
two
women
juno
i
do
think
you
quite
understand
i
meant
that
i
am
in
love
with
you
lunn
relapsing
into
deepest
boredom
oh
that
men
do
fall
in
love
with
me
they
all
seem
to
think
me
a
creature
with
volcanic
passions
i
sure
i
do
know
why
for
all
the
volcanic
women
i
know
are
plain
little
creatures
with
sandy
hair
i
do
consider
human
volcanoes
respectable
and
i
so
tired
of
the
subject
our
house
is
always
full
of
women
who
are
in
love
with
my
husband
and
men
who
are
in
love
with
me
we
encourage
it
because
it
pleasant
to
have
company
juno
and
is
your
husband
as
insensible
as
yourself
lunn
oh
gregory
not
insensible
very
far
from
it
but
i
am
the
only
woman
in
the
world
for
him
juno
but
you
are
you
really
as
insensible
as
you
say
you
are
lunn
i
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
i
not
at
all
insensible
by
nature
but
i
do
know
whether
you
noticed
it
i
am
what
people
call
rather
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
juno
passionately
noticed
it
oh
lunn
have
i
been
able
to
notice
anything
else
since
we
met
lunn
there
you
go
like
all
the
rest
of
them
i
ask
you
how
do
you
expect
a
woman
to
keep
up
what
you
call
her
sensibility
when
this
sort
of
thing
has
happened
to
her
about
three
times
a
week
ever
since
she
was
seventeen
it
used
to
upset
me
and
terrify
me
at
first
then
i
got
rather
a
taste
for
it
it
came
to
a
climax
with
gregory
that
was
why
i
married
him
then
it
became
a
mild
lark
hardly
worth
the
trouble
after
that
i
found
it
valuable
once
or
twice
as
a
spinal
tonic
when
i
was
run
down
but
now
it
an
unmitigated
bore
i
do
mind
your
declaration
i
daresay
it
gives
you
a
certain
pleasure
to
make
it
i
quite
understand
that
you
adore
me
but
if
you
do
mind
rather
you
did
keep
on
saying
so
juno
is
there
then
no
hope
for
me
lunn
oh
yes
gregory
has
an
idea
that
married
women
keep
lists
of
the
men
they
marry
if
they
become
widows
i
put
your
name
down
if
that
will
satisfy
you
juno
is
the
list
a
long
one
lunn
do
you
mean
the
real
list
not
the
one
i
show
to
gregory
there
are
hundreds
of
names
on
that
but
the
little
private
list
that
he
better
not
see
juno
oh
will
you
really
put
me
on
that
say
you
will
lunn
well
perhaps
i
will
he
kisses
her
hand
now
do
begin
abusing
the
privilege
juno
may
i
call
you
by
your
christian
name
lunn
no
it
too
long
you
ca
go
about
calling
a
woman
seraphita
juno
ecstatically
seraphita
lunn
i
used
to
be
called
sally
at
home
but
when
i
married
a
man
named
lunn
of
course
that
became
ridiculous
that
my
one
little
pet
joke
call
me
lunn
for
short
and
change
the
subject
or
i
shall
go
to
sleep
juno
i
ca
change
the
subject
for
me
there
is
no
other
subject
why
else
have
you
put
me
on
your
list
lunn
because
you
a
solicitor
gregory
a
solicitor
accustomed
to
my
husband
being
a
solicitor
and
telling
me
things
he
ought
to
tell
anybody
juno
ruefully
is
that
all
oh
i
ca
believe
that
the
voice
of
love
has
ever
thoroughly
awakened
you
lunn
no
it
sends
me
to
sleep
juno
appeals
against
this
by
an
amorous
demonstration
it
no
use
juno
i
hopelessly
respectable
the
jenkinses
always
were
do
you
realize
that
unless
most
women
were
like
that
the
world
could
go
on
as
it
does
juno
darkly
you
think
it
goes
on
respectably
but
i
can
tell
you
as
a
solicitor
lunn
stuff
of
course
all
the
disreputable
people
who
get
into
trouble
go
to
you
just
as
all
the
sick
people
go
to
the
doctors
but
most
people
never
go
to
a
solicitor
juno
rising
with
a
growing
sense
of
injury
look
here
lunn
do
you
think
a
man
heart
is
a
potato
or
a
turnip
or
a
ball
of
knitting
wool
that
you
can
throw
it
away
like
this
lunn
i
do
throw
away
balls
of
knitting
wool
a
man
heart
seems
to
me
much
like
a
sponge
it
sops
up
dirty
water
as
well
as
clean
juno
i
have
never
been
treated
like
this
in
my
life
here
am
i
a
married
man
with
a
most
attractive
wife
a
wife
i
adore
and
who
adores
me
and
has
never
as
much
as
looked
at
any
other
man
since
we
were
married
i
come
and
throw
all
this
at
your
feet
i
i
a
solicitor
braving
the
risk
of
your
husband
putting
me
into
the
divorce
court
and
making
me
a
beggar
and
an
outcast
i
do
this
for
your
sake
and
you
go
on
as
if
i
were
making
no
sacrifice
as
if
i
had
told
you
it
a
fine
evening
or
asked
you
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
it
not
human
it
not
right
love
has
its
rights
as
well
as
respectability
he
sits
down
again
aloof
and
sulky
lunn
nonsense
here
here
a
flower
she
gives
him
one
go
and
dream
over
it
until
you
feel
hungry
nothing
brings
people
to
their
senses
like
hunger
juno
contemplating
the
flower
without
rapture
what
good
this
lunn
snatching
it
from
him
oh
you
do
love
me
a
bit
juno
yes
i
do
or
at
least
i
did
but
i
an
englishman
and
i
think
you
ought
to
respect
the
conventions
of
english
life
lunn
but
i
am
respecting
them
and
you
not
juno
pardon
me
i
may
be
doing
wrong
but
i
doing
it
in
a
proper
and
customary
manner
you
may
be
doing
right
but
you
doing
it
in
an
unusual
and
questionable
manner
i
am
not
prepared
to
put
up
with
that
i
can
stand
being
badly
treated
i
no
baby
and
can
take
care
of
myself
with
anybody
and
of
course
i
can
stand
being
well
treated
but
the
thing
i
ca
stand
is
being
unexpectedly
treated
it
outside
my
scheme
of
life
so
come
now
you
got
to
behave
naturally
and
straightforwardly
with
me
you
can
leave
husband
and
child
home
friends
and
country
for
my
sake
and
come
with
me
to
some
southern
isle
or
say
south
america
where
we
can
be
all
in
all
to
one
another
or
you
can
tell
your
husband
and
let
him
jolly
well
punch
my
head
if
he
can
but
i
damned
if
i
going
to
stand
any
eccentricity
it
not
respectable
gregory
coming
in
from
the
terrace
and
advancing
with
dignity
to
his
wife
end
of
the
chesterfield
will
you
have
the
goodness
sir
in
addressing
this
lady
to
keep
your
temper
and
refrain
from
using
profane
language
lunn
rising
delighted
gregory
darling
she
enfolds
him
in
a
copious
embrace
juno
rising
you
make
love
to
another
man
to
my
face
lunn
why
he
my
husband
juno
that
takes
away
the
last
rag
of
excuse
for
such
conduct
a
nice
world
it
would
be
if
married
people
were
to
carry
on
their
endearments
before
everybody
gregory
this
is
ridiculous
what
the
devil
business
is
it
of
yours
what
passes
between
my
wife
and
myself
you
not
her
husband
are
you
juno
not
at
present
but
i
on
the
list
i
her
prospective
husband
you
only
her
actual
one
i
the
anticipation
you
the
disappointment
lunn
oh
my
gregory
is
not
a
disappointment
fondly
are
you
dear
gregory
you
just
wait
my
pet
i
settle
this
chap
for
you
he
disengages
himself
from
her
embrace
and
faces
juno
she
sits
down
placidly
you
call
me
a
disappointment
do
you
well
i
suppose
every
husband
a
disappointment
what
about
yourself
do
try
to
look
like
an
unmarried
man
i
happen
to
know
the
lady
you
disappointed
i
travelled
in
the
same
ship
with
her
and
juno
and
you
fell
in
love
with
her
gregory
taken
aback
who
told
you
that
juno
aha
you
confess
it
well
if
you
want
to
know
nobody
told
me
everybody
falls
in
love
with
my
wife
gregory
and
do
you
fall
in
love
with
everybody
wife
juno
certainly
not
only
with
yours
lunn
but
what
the
good
of
saying
that
juno
i
married
to
him
and
there
an
end
of
it
juno
not
at
all
you
can
get
a
divorce
lunn
what
for
juno
for
his
misconduct
with
my
wife
gregory
deeply
indignant
how
dare
you
sir
asperse
the
character
of
that
sweet
lady
a
lady
whom
i
have
taken
under
my
protection
juno
protection
juno
returning
hastily
really
you
must
be
more
careful
what
you
say
about
me
lunn
juno
my
precious
he
embraces
her
pardon
this
betrayal
of
my
feeling
but
i
not
seen
my
wife
for
several
weeks
and
she
is
very
dear
to
me
gregory
i
call
this
cheek
who
is
making
love
to
his
own
wife
before
people
now
pray
lunn
wo
you
introduce
me
to
your
wife
juno
juno
how
do
you
do
they
shake
hands
and
juno
sits
down
beside
lunn
on
her
left
lunn
i
so
glad
to
find
you
do
credit
to
gregory
taste
naturally
rather
particular
about
the
women
he
falls
in
love
with
juno
sternly
this
is
no
way
to
take
your
husband
unfaithfulness
to
lunn
you
ought
to
teach
your
wife
better
where
her
feelings
it
scandalous
gregory
what
about
your
own
conduct
pray
juno
i
do
defend
it
and
there
an
end
of
the
matter
gregory
well
upon
my
soul
what
difference
does
your
not
defending
it
make
juno
a
fundamental
difference
to
serious
people
i
may
appear
wicked
i
do
defend
myself
i
am
wicked
though
not
bad
at
heart
to
thoughtless
people
i
may
even
appear
comic
well
laugh
at
me
i
have
given
myself
away
but
lunn
seems
to
have
no
opinion
at
all
about
me
she
does
seem
to
know
whether
i
wicked
or
comic
she
seem
to
care
she
has
no
more
sense
i
say
it
not
right
i
repeat
i
have
sinned
and
i
prepared
to
suffer
juno
have
you
really
sinned
tops
lunn
blandly
i
do
remember
your
sinning
i
have
a
shocking
bad
memory
for
trifles
but
i
think
i
should
remember
that
if
you
mean
me
juno
raging
trifles
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
monster
gregory
do
you
dare
call
my
wife
a
monster
juno
rising
quickly
and
coming
between
them
please
do
lose
your
temper
lunn
i
wo
have
my
tops
bullied
gregory
well
then
let
him
not
brag
about
sinning
with
my
wife
he
turns
impulsively
to
his
wife
makes
her
rise
and
takes
her
proudly
on
his
arm
what
pretension
has
he
to
any
such
honor
juno
i
sinned
in
intention
juno
abandons
him
and
resumes
her
seat
chilled
i
as
guilty
as
if
i
had
actually
sinned
and
i
insist
on
being
treated
as
a
sinner
and
not
walked
over
as
if
i
done
nothing
by
your
wife
or
any
other
man
lunn
tush
she
sits
down
again
contemptuously
juno
furious
i
wo
be
belittled
lunn
to
juno
i
hope
you
come
and
stay
with
us
now
that
you
and
gregory
are
such
friends
juno
juno
this
insane
magnanimity
lunn
do
you
think
you
said
enough
juno
this
is
a
matter
for
two
women
to
settle
wo
you
take
a
stroll
on
the
beach
with
my
gregory
while
we
talk
it
over
gregory
is
a
splendid
listener
juno
i
do
think
any
good
can
come
of
a
conversation
between
lunn
and
myself
we
can
hardly
be
expected
to
improve
one
morals
he
passes
behind
the
chesterfield
to
lunn
end
seizes
a
chair
deliberately
pushes
it
between
gregory
and
lunn
and
sits
down
with
folded
arms
resolved
not
to
budge
gregory
oh
indeed
oh
all
right
if
you
come
to
that
he
crosses
to
juno
plants
a
chair
by
her
side
and
sits
down
with
equal
determination
juno
now
we
are
both
equally
guilty
gregory
pardon
me
i
not
guilty
juno
in
intention
do
quibble
you
were
guilty
in
intention
as
i
was
gregory
no
i
should
rather
describe
myself
guilty
in
fact
but
not
in
intention
juno
rising
and
what
juno
exclaiming
no
really
lunn
simultaneously
gregory
gregory
yes
i
maintain
that
i
am
responsible
for
my
intentions
only
and
not
for
reflex
actions
over
which
i
have
no
control
juno
sits
down
ashamed
i
promised
my
mother
that
i
would
never
tell
a
lie
and
that
i
would
never
make
love
to
a
married
woman
i
never
have
told
a
lie
lunn
remonstrating
gregory
she
sits
down
again
gregory
i
say
never
on
many
occasions
i
have
resorted
to
prevarication
but
on
great
occasions
i
have
always
told
the
truth
i
regard
this
as
a
great
occasion
and
i
wo
be
intimidated
into
breaking
my
promise
i
solemnly
declare
that
i
did
not
know
until
this
evening
that
juno
was
married
she
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
that
from
that
moment
my
intentions
were
strictly
and
resolutely
honorable
though
my
conduct
which
i
could
not
control
and
am
therefore
not
responsible
for
was
disgraceful
or
would
have
been
had
this
gentleman
not
walked
in
and
begun
making
love
to
my
wife
under
my
very
nose
juno
flinging
himself
back
into
his
chair
well
i
like
this
lunn
really
darling
there
no
use
in
the
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
gregory
when
you
say
darling
may
i
ask
which
of
us
you
are
addressing
lunn
i
really
do
know
i
getting
hopelessly
confused
juno
why
do
you
let
my
wife
say
something
i
do
think
she
ought
to
be
thrust
into
the
background
like
this
lunn
i
sorry
i
sure
please
excuse
me
dear
juno
thoughtfully
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
must
think
over
it
i
have
always
been
rather
severe
on
this
sort
of
thing
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
did
behave
as
i
thought
i
should
behave
i
did
intend
to
be
wicked
but
somehow
or
other
nature
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
did
take
much
notice
of
my
intentions
gregory
instinctively
seeks
her
hand
and
presses
it
and
i
really
did
think
tops
that
i
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
for
you
juno
cheerfully
oh
that
all
right
my
precious
lunn
thought
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
for
him
gregory
reflectively
so
she
is
in
a
sort
of
a
way
juno
flaring
up
and
so
is
my
wife
do
you
set
up
to
be
a
better
husband
than
i
am
for
you
not
i
owned
i
wrong
you
have
lunn
are
you
sorry
gregory
gregory
perplexed
sorry
lunn
yes
sorry
i
think
it
time
for
you
to
say
you
sorry
and
to
make
friends
with
juno
before
we
all
dine
together
gregory
seraphita
i
promised
my
mother
juno
involuntarily
oh
bother
your
mother
recovering
herself
i
beg
your
pardon
gregory
a
promise
is
a
promise
i
ca
tell
a
deliberate
lie
i
know
i
ought
to
be
sorry
but
the
flat
fact
is
that
i
not
sorry
i
find
that
in
this
business
somehow
or
other
there
is
a
disastrous
separation
between
my
moral
principles
and
my
conduct
juno
there
nothing
disastrous
about
it
it
does
matter
about
your
principles
if
your
conduct
is
all
right
gregory
bosh
it
does
matter
about
your
principles
if
your
conduct
is
all
right
juno
but
your
conduct
is
all
right
and
my
principles
are
gregory
what
the
good
of
your
principles
being
right
if
they
work
juno
they
will
work
sir
if
you
exercise
gregory
oh
yes
if
if
if
you
know
jolly
well
that
does
work
either
when
you
really
want
a
thing
how
much
have
you
sacrificed
yourself
pray
lunn
oh
a
great
deal
gregory
do
be
rude
juno
is
a
very
nice
man
he
has
been
most
attentive
to
me
on
the
voyage
gregory
and
juno
a
very
nice
woman
she
ought
to
be
but
she
is
juno
why
ought
she
to
be
a
nice
woman
pray
gregory
i
mean
she
ought
to
be
nice
to
me
and
you
ought
to
be
nice
to
my
wife
and
your
wife
ought
to
like
me
and
my
wife
ought
to
like
you
and
if
they
do
they
ought
to
go
on
liking
us
and
i
ought
to
like
your
wife
and
you
ought
to
like
mine
and
if
we
do
we
ought
to
go
on
liking
them
but
we
do
all
of
us
we
ought
but
we
do
juno
but
my
dear
boy
if
we
admit
we
are
in
the
wrong
where
the
harm
of
it
we
not
perfect
but
as
long
as
we
keep
the
ideal
before
us
gregory
how
juno
by
admitting
we
were
wrong
lunn
springing
up
out
of
patience
and
pacing
round
the
lounge
intolerantly
well
really
i
must
have
my
dinner
these
two
men
with
their
morality
and
their
promises
to
their
mothers
and
their
admissions
that
they
were
wrong
and
their
sinning
and
suffering
and
their
going
on
at
one
another
as
if
it
meant
anything
or
as
if
it
mattered
are
getting
on
my
nerves
stooping
over
the
back
of
the
chesterfield
to
address
juno
if
you
will
be
so
very
good
my
dear
as
to
take
my
sentimental
husband
off
my
hands
occasionally
i
shall
be
more
than
obliged
to
you
i
sure
you
can
stand
more
male
sentimentality
than
i
can
sweeping
away
to
the
fireplace
i
on
my
part
will
do
my
best
to
amuse
your
excellent
husband
when
you
find
him
tiresome
juno
i
call
this
polyandry
lunn
i
wish
you
would
call
innocent
things
by
offensive
names
juno
what
do
you
call
your
own
conduct
juno
rising
i
tell
you
i
have
admitted
gregory
what
the
good
of
keeping
on
at
that
juno
together
oh
not
that
again
please
lunn
tops
i
scream
if
you
say
that
again
juno
oh
well
if
you
wo
listen
to
me
he
sits
down
again
juno
what
is
the
position
now
exactly
lunn
shrugs
her
shoulders
and
gives
up
the
conundrum
gregory
looks
at
juno
juno
turns
away
his
head
huffily
i
mean
what
are
we
going
to
do
lunn
what
would
you
advise
juno
juno
i
should
advise
you
to
divorce
your
husband
lunn
do
you
want
me
to
drag
your
wife
into
court
and
disgrace
her
juno
no
i
forgot
that
excuse
me
but
for
the
moment
i
thought
i
was
married
to
you
gregory
i
think
we
had
better
let
bygones
be
bygones
to
juno
very
tenderly
you
will
forgive
me
wo
you
why
should
you
let
a
moment
forgetfulness
embitter
all
our
future
life
juno
but
it
lunn
who
has
to
forgive
you
gregory
oh
dash
it
i
forgot
this
is
getting
ridiculous
lunn
i
getting
hungry
juno
do
you
really
mind
lunn
lunn
my
dear
juno
gregory
is
one
of
those
terribly
uxorious
men
who
ought
to
have
ten
wives
if
any
really
nice
woman
will
take
him
off
my
hands
for
a
day
or
two
occasionally
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
to
her
gregory
seraphita
you
cut
me
to
the
soul
he
weeps
lunn
serve
you
right
you
think
it
quite
proper
if
it
cut
me
to
the
soul
juno
am
i
to
take
sibthorpe
off
your
hands
too
lunn
juno
rising
do
you
suppose
i
allow
this
juno
you
admitted
that
you
done
wrong
tops
what
the
use
of
your
allowing
or
not
allowing
after
that
juno
i
do
not
admit
that
i
have
done
wrong
i
admit
that
what
i
did
was
wrong
gregory
can
you
explain
the
distinction
juno
it
quite
plain
to
anyone
but
an
imbecile
if
you
tell
me
done
something
wrong
you
insult
me
but
if
you
say
that
something
that
i
did
is
wrong
you
simply
raise
a
question
of
morals
i
tell
you
flatly
if
you
say
i
did
anything
wrong
you
will
have
to
fight
me
in
fact
i
think
we
ought
to
fight
anyhow
i
do
particularly
want
to
but
i
feel
that
england
expects
us
to
gregory
i
wo
fight
if
you
beat
me
my
wife
would
share
my
humiliation
if
i
beat
you
she
would
sympathize
with
you
and
loathe
me
for
my
brutality
lunn
not
to
mention
that
as
we
are
human
beings
and
not
reindeer
or
barndoor
fowl
if
two
men
presumed
to
fight
for
us
we
decently
ever
speak
to
either
of
them
again
gregory
besides
neither
of
us
could
beat
the
other
as
we
neither
of
us
know
how
to
fight
we
should
only
blacken
each
other
eyes
and
make
fools
of
ourselves
juno
i
do
admit
that
every
englishman
can
use
his
fists
gregory
you
an
englishman
can
you
use
yours
juno
i
presume
so
i
never
tried
juno
you
never
told
me
you
could
fight
tops
i
thought
you
were
an
accomplished
boxer
juno
my
precious
i
never
gave
you
any
ground
for
such
a
belief
juno
you
always
talked
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
you
spoke
with
the
greatest
contempt
of
men
who
did
kick
other
men
downstairs
juno
well
i
ca
kick
lunn
downstairs
we
on
the
ground
floor
juno
you
could
throw
him
into
the
harbor
gregory
do
you
want
me
to
be
thrown
into
the
harbor
juno
no
i
only
want
to
show
tops
that
he
making
a
ghastly
fool
of
himself
gregory
rising
and
prowling
disgustedly
between
the
chesterfield
and
the
windows
we
all
making
fools
of
ourselves
juno
following
him
well
if
we
not
to
fight
i
must
insist
at
least
on
your
never
speaking
to
my
wife
again
gregory
does
my
speaking
to
your
wife
do
you
any
harm
juno
no
but
it
the
proper
course
to
take
emphatically
we
must
behave
with
some
sort
of
decency
lunn
and
are
you
never
going
to
speak
to
me
again
juno
juno
i
prepared
to
promise
never
to
do
so
i
think
your
husband
has
a
right
to
demand
that
then
if
i
speak
to
you
after
it
will
not
be
his
fault
it
will
be
a
breach
of
my
promise
and
i
shall
not
attempt
to
defend
my
conduct
gregory
facing
him
i
shall
talk
to
your
wife
as
often
as
she
let
me
juno
i
have
no
objection
to
your
speaking
to
me
lunn
juno
then
i
shall
take
steps
gregory
what
steps
juno
steps
measures
proceedings
what
steps
as
may
seem
advisable
lunn
to
juno
can
your
husband
afford
a
scandal
juno
juno
no
lunn
neither
can
mine
gregory
juno
i
very
sorry
i
let
you
in
for
all
this
i
know
how
it
is
that
we
contrive
to
make
feelings
like
ours
which
seems
to
me
to
be
beautiful
and
sacred
feelings
and
which
lead
to
such
interesting
and
exciting
adventures
end
in
vulgar
squabbles
and
degrading
scenes
juno
i
decline
to
admit
that
my
conduct
has
been
vulgar
or
degrading
gregory
i
promised
juno
look
here
old
chap
i
do
say
a
word
against
your
mother
and
i
sorry
she
dead
but
really
you
know
most
women
are
mothers
and
they
all
die
some
time
or
other
yet
that
does
make
them
infallible
authorities
on
morals
does
it
gregory
i
was
about
to
say
so
myself
let
me
add
that
if
you
do
things
merely
because
you
think
some
other
fool
expects
you
to
do
them
and
he
expects
you
to
do
them
because
he
thinks
you
expect
him
to
expect
you
to
do
them
it
will
end
in
everybody
doing
what
nobody
wants
to
do
which
is
in
my
opinion
a
silly
state
of
things
juno
lunn
i
love
your
wife
and
that
all
about
it
gregory
juno
i
love
yours
what
then
juno
clearly
she
must
never
see
you
again
juno
why
not
juno
why
not
my
love
i
surprised
at
you
juno
am
i
to
speak
only
to
men
who
dislike
me
juno
yes
i
think
that
is
properly
speaking
a
married
woman
duty
juno
then
i
wo
do
it
that
flat
i
like
to
be
liked
i
like
to
be
loved
i
want
everyone
round
me
to
love
me
i
do
want
to
meet
or
speak
to
anyone
who
does
like
me
juno
but
my
precious
this
is
the
most
horrible
immorality
lunn
i
do
intend
to
give
up
meeting
you
juno
you
amuse
me
very
much
i
do
like
being
loved
it
bores
me
but
i
do
like
to
be
amused
juno
i
hope
we
shall
meet
very
often
but
i
hope
also
we
shall
not
defend
our
conduct
juno
rising
this
is
unendurable
we
all
been
flirting
need
we
go
on
footling
about
it
juno
huffily
i
do
know
what
you
call
footling
juno
cutting
him
short
you
do
you
footling
lunn
is
footling
ca
we
admit
that
we
human
and
have
done
with
it
juno
i
have
admitted
it
all
along
i
juno
almost
screaming
then
stop
footling
the
dinner
gong
sounds
lunn
rising
thank
heaven
let
go
in
to
dinner
gregory
take
in
juno
gregory
but
surely
i
ought
to
take
in
our
guest
and
not
my
own
wife
lunn
well
juno
is
not
your
wife
is
she
gregory
oh
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon
i
hopelessly
confused
he
offers
his
arm
to
juno
rather
apprehensively
juno
you
seem
quite
afraid
of
me
she
takes
his
arm
gregory
i
am
i
simply
adore
you
they
go
out
together
and
as
they
pass
through
the
door
he
turns
and
says
in
a
ringing
voice
to
the
other
couple
i
have
said
to
juno
that
i
simply
adore
her
he
takes
her
out
defiantly
lunn
calling
after
him
yes
dear
she
a
darling
to
juno
now
sibthorpe
juno
giving
her
his
arm
gallantly
you
have
called
me
sibthorpe
thank
you
i
think
lunn
conduct
fully
justifies
me
in
allowing
you
to
do
it
lunn
yes
i
think
you
may
let
yourself
go
now
juno
seraphita
i
worship
you
beyond
expression
lunn
sibthorpe
you
amuse
me
beyond
description
come
they
go
in
to
dinner
together
