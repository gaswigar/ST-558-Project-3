prologue
if
you
leave
the
city
by
the
porta
maggiore
and
take
the
via
prænestina
which
leads
east
into
the
sabine
hills
at
some
kilometers
distance
from
rome
you
will
pass
on
your
left
a
village
climbing
up
the
hillside
this
is
palestrina
the
old
roman
præneste
and
a
short
distance
on
the
will
find
branching
off
from
the
straight
roman
highway
a
steep
mountain
road
which
if
you
stick
to
it
long
enough
will
take
you
after
many
windings
to
castel
madama
and
tivoli
several
kilometers
along
this
road
you
will
see
shooting
up
from
a
bare
crag
above
you
a
little
stone
hamlet
crowned
by
the
ruins
of
a
mediaeval
fortress
the
built
in
the
days
when
a
stronghold
was
more
to
be
thought
of
than
a
and
its
people
from
habit
or
love
or
perhaps
sheer
necessity
have
lived
on
there
ever
since
going
down
in
the
morning
to
their
work
in
the
plain
and
toiling
up
at
night
to
their
homes
on
the
hill
so
steep
is
its
site
that
the
doorway
of
one
house
looks
down
on
the
roof
of
the
house
below
and
its
narrow
stone
streets
are
in
reality
flights
of
stairs
the
only
approach
is
from
the
front
by
a
road
which
winds
and
unwinds
like
a
serpent
and
leads
at
last
to
the
porta
della
luna
through
which
all
of
the
traffic
enters
the
town
the
gate
is
ornamented
with
the
crest
of
the
phoenix
rising
out
of
the
flame
supported
by
a
heavy
machicolated
top
from
which
in
the
old
days
stones
and
burning
oil
might
be
dropped
upon
the
heads
of
the
unwelcome
guests
the
town
is
a
picturesque
little
would
be
hard
to
find
a
place
more
so
in
the
sabine
villages
it
is
very
very
poor
in
the
march
of
the
centuries
it
has
fallen
out
of
step
and
been
left
far
behind
to
look
at
it
one
would
scarcely
dream
that
on
the
clear
days
the
walls
and
towers
of
modern
rome
are
in
sight
on
the
horizon
but
in
its
time
castel
vivalanti
was
not
insignificant
this
little
hamlet
has
entertained
history
within
its
walls
it
has
bodily
outfaced
robber
barons
and
papal
troops
it
has
been
besieged
and
conquered
and
alas
that
by
its
own
prince
twice
has
it
been
razed
to
the
ground
and
twice
rebuilt
in
one
way
or
another
though
it
has
weathered
the
centuries
and
it
stands
grey
and
forlorn
clustering
about
the
walls
of
its
donjon
and
keep
castel
vivalanti
as
in
the
middle
ages
still
gives
the
title
to
a
roman
prince
the
house
of
vivalanti
was
powerful
in
its
day
and
the
princes
may
often
be
met
always
to
their
the
history
of
the
papal
states
they
were
oftener
at
war
than
at
peace
with
the
holy
see
and
there
is
the
story
of
one
pope
who
spent
four
weary
months
watching
the
view
from
a
very
small
window
in
vivalanti
s
donjon
but
in
spite
of
their
unholy
quarrels
they
were
at
times
devout
enough
and
twice
a
cardinal
s
hat
has
been
worn
in
the
family
the
house
of
late
years
has
dwindled
somewhat
both
in
fortune
and
importance
but
nevertheless
vivalanti
is
a
name
which
is
still
spoken
with
respect
among
the
old
nobles
of
rome
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
on
which
the
village
stands
are
well
wooded
and
green
with
and
cypresses
olive
orchards
and
vineyards
here
the
princes
built
their
villas
when
the
wars
with
the
popes
were
safely
at
an
end
and
they
could
risk
coming
down
from
their
stronghold
on
the
mountain
the
old
villa
was
built
about
a
mile
below
the
town
and
the
gardens
were
laid
out
in
terraces
and
parterres
along
the
slope
of
the
hill
it
has
long
been
in
ruin
but
its
foundations
still
stand
and
the
plan
of
the
gardens
may
easily
be
traced
you
will
see
the
entrance
at
the
left
of
the
massive
stone
gateway
topped
with
urns
and
a
double
row
of
cypresses
bordering
a
once
stately
avenue
now
grown
over
with
weeds
if
you
pause
for
a
you
can
not
help
doing
will
see
between
the
portals
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
some
crumbling
arches
and
even
if
your
eyes
are
good
the
fountain
itself
any
contadino
that
you
meet
on
the
road
will
tell
you
the
story
of
the
old
villa
vivalanti
and
the
bad
prince
who
was
by
the
grace
of
god
murdered
two
centuries
ago
he
will
tell
story
not
uncommon
in
storehouses
bursting
with
grain
while
the
peasants
were
starving
and
of
how
one
moonlight
night
as
the
prince
was
strolling
on
the
terrace
contentedly
pondering
his
wickednesses
of
the
day
a
peasant
from
his
own
village
up
on
the
mountain
creeping
behind
him
quiet
as
a
cat
stabbed
him
in
the
back
and
dropped
his
body
in
the
fountain
he
will
tell
you
how
the
light
from
the
burning
villa
was
seen
as
far
as
rocca
di
papa
in
the
alban
hills
and
he
will
add
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrug
that
some
people
say
when
the
moon
is
full
the
old
prince
comes
back
and
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
fountain
and
thinks
of
his
sins
but
that
for
himself
he
thinks
it
an
old
woman
s
tale
whereupon
he
will
cast
a
quick
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
dark
shadow
of
the
cypresses
and
covertly
cross
himself
as
he
wishes
you
you
can
not
wonder
that
the
young
prince
two
centuries
ago
did
not
build
his
new
villa
on
the
site
of
the
old
for
even
had
he
like
the
brave
contadino
cared
nothing
for
ghosts
still
it
was
scarcely
a
hallowed
spot
and
lovers
would
not
care
to
stroll
by
the
fountain
so
it
happens
that
you
must
travel
some
distance
further
along
the
same
road
before
you
reach
the
gates
of
the
new
villa
built
anno
domini
in
the
pontificate
of
his
holiness
innocent
xii
here
you
will
find
no
gloomy
cypresses
the
approach
is
bordered
by
spreading
the
villa
itself
is
a
rambling
affair
and
though
slightly
is
still
decidedly
imposing
with
its
various
wings
its
balconies
and
loggia
and
marble
terrace
the
new
such
one
must
call
west
and
north
on
the
west
it
looks
down
over
olive
orchards
and
vineyards
to
the
roman
campagna
with
the
dome
of
peter
s
a
white
speck
in
the
distance
and
beyond
it
to
a
narrow
shining
ribbon
of
sea
on
the
north
it
looks
up
to
the
sabine
mountains
with
the
height
of
soracte
rising
like
an
island
on
the
horizon
for
the
rest
it
is
surrounded
by
laurel
and
ilex
groves
with
long
shady
walks
and
leafy
arbors
with
fountains
and
cascades
and
broken
statues
all
laid
out
in
the
stately
formality
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
the
trees
are
no
longer
so
carefully
trimmed
as
they
were
a
century
ago
the
sun
rarely
shines
in
these
green
alleys
and
the
nightingales
sing
all
day
through
every
season
but
especially
in
the
springtime
the
are
glowing
with
colour
hedges
of
roses
oleanders
and
golden
laburnum
scarlet
pomegranate
blossoms
and
red
and
white
camellias
marguerites
and
lilies
and
purple
irises
bloom
together
in
flaming
profusion
and
twice
a
year
in
the
spring
and
the
autumn
the
soft
yellow
walls
of
the
villa
are
covered
with
lavender
wistaria
and
pink
climbing
roses
and
every
breeze
is
filled
with
their
fragrance
it
is
a
spot
in
which
to
dream
of
old
italy
of
cardinals
and
pages
and
gorgeous
lackeys
of
gallant
courtiers
and
beautiful
ladies
of
romeos
and
juliets
trailing
back
and
forth
over
the
marble
terrace
and
making
love
under
the
italian
moon
but
if
there
have
been
lovers
as
is
doubtless
the
case
there
have
also
been
haters
among
the
vivalanti
and
you
may
read
of
more
than
one
prince
murdered
by
hands
other
than
those
of
his
peasants
the
walls
of
the
new
villa
in
the
course
of
their
two
hundred
years
have
looked
down
on
their
full
share
of
tragedies
and
the
vivalanti
annals
are
grim
reading
withal
and
now
having
pursued
the
vivalanti
so
far
you
may
possibly
be
disappointed
to
hear
that
the
story
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
but
if
you
are
interested
in
learning
more
of
the
family
you
can
find
his
excellency
anastasio
di
vivalanti
the
present
prince
and
the
last
of
the
line
any
afternoon
during
the
season
in
the
casino
at
monte
carlo
he
is
a
slight
young
man
with
a
dark
sallow
face
and
many
fine
lines
under
his
eyes
then
why
you
may
ask
if
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
vivalanti
have
we
lingered
so
long
in
their
garden
the
garden
does
concern
us
though
the
young
prince
may
not
and
it
is
a
pleasant
spot
you
must
acknowledge
in
which
to
linger
the
people
with
whom
we
are
concerned
are
i
hesitate
to
say
it
for
fear
of
destroying
the
glamour
an
american
family
yes
it
is
best
to
confess
it
american
millionaires
it
is
worst
is
told
but
why
may
i
ask
in
my
turn
is
there
anything
so
inherently
distressing
in
the
idea
of
an
american
family
of
millionaires
spending
the
summer
in
a
italian
villa
up
in
the
sabine
when
the
rightful
heir
prefers
at
monte
carlo
must
they
of
necessity
spoil
the
romance
they
are
human
and
have
their
passions
like
the
rest
of
us
and
one
of
them
at
least
is
young
and
men
have
called
her
in
this
very
garden
chapter
i
it
was
late
and
the
studio
was
already
well
filled
when
two
were
ushered
into
the
a
woman
still
almost
young
and
still
in
a
kindly
light
beautiful
the
other
a
girl
emphatically
young
her
youth
riding
triumphant
over
other
qualities
which
in
a
few
years
would
become
significant
a
slight
almost
portentous
hush
had
fallen
over
the
room
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
and
shook
hands
with
their
host
in
a
group
near
the
door
a
young
was
laurence
sybert
the
first
secretary
of
the
american
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
with
the
ejaculation
ah
the
wheat
princess
be
careful
sybert
she
will
hear
you
the
who
stood
at
his
elbow
warned
sybert
responded
with
a
laugh
and
a
but
his
tones
though
low
had
carried
and
the
girl
flashed
upon
the
group
a
pair
of
vivid
hazel
eyes
containing
a
light
as
though
she
had
caught
the
words
but
not
the
meaning
her
vague
expression
changed
to
one
of
recognition
she
nodded
to
the
two
diplomats
as
she
turned
away
to
welcome
a
delegation
of
young
lieutenants
brilliant
in
blue
and
gold
and
shining
boots
who
is
she
another
member
of
the
group
inquired
as
he
adjusted
a
pair
of
and
turned
to
scrutinize
the
american
was
american
to
the
most
casual
observer
from
the
piquant
details
of
her
gown
to
the
masterly
fashion
in
which
she
handled
her
four
young
men
don
t
you
know
there
was
just
a
touch
of
irony
in
sybert
s
tone
miss
marcia
copley
the
daughter
of
the
american
wheat
fancy
you
ve
seen
his
name
mentioned
in
the
well
well
and
so
that
s
willard
copley
s
daughter
he
readjusted
his
glasses
and
examined
her
again
from
this
new
point
of
view
she
isn
t
was
his
comment
the
wheat
princess
he
repeated
the
phrase
with
a
laugh
i
suppose
she
has
come
over
to
marry
an
italian
prince
and
make
the
title
good
the
originator
of
the
phrase
shrugged
anew
with
the
intimation
that
it
was
nothing
to
him
who
miss
marcia
copley
married
and
who
is
the
lady
with
her
it
was
melville
the
who
replied
her
aunt
howard
copley
they
live
in
the
palazzo
ah
to
be
sure
yes
yes
i
know
who
they
are
her
husband
s
a
reformer
or
a
philanthropist
or
something
of
the
sort
isn
t
he
i
ve
seen
him
at
the
meets
i
say
you
know
he
added
with
an
appreciative
smile
that
s
rather
good
the
way
the
two
brothers
balance
each
other
philanthropist
and
wheat
king
an
english
girl
in
the
group
turned
and
studied
the
american
girl
a
moment
with
a
critical
scrutiny
marcia
copley
s
appearance
was
daintily
attractive
her
hat
and
gown
and
furs
were
a
burnished
brown
exactly
the
colour
of
her
hair
every
little
accessory
of
her
dress
was
unobtrusively
fastidious
her
whole
bearing
her
easy
social
grace
spoke
of
a
past
in
which
the
way
had
been
always
smoothed
by
money
she
carried
with
her
a
touch
of
imperiousness
a
large
air
of
commanding
the
world
the
english
girl
noted
these
things
with
jealous
feminine
eyes
really
she
said
i
don
t
see
how
she
has
the
audacity
to
face
people
i
should
think
that
every
beggar
in
the
street
would
be
a
reproach
to
there
were
beggars
in
italy
long
before
willard
copley
cornered
wheat
melville
returned
if
what
the
says
is
true
some
one
ventured
howard
copley
is
as
much
implicated
as
his
i
dare
say
another
laughed
millionaire
philanthropists
have
a
way
of
taking
back
with
the
left
hand
what
they
have
given
with
the
sybert
had
been
listening
in
a
fashion
to
the
strictures
on
the
niece
but
in
response
to
the
implied
criticism
of
the
uncle
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
howard
copley
is
no
more
implicated
in
the
deal
than
i
am
he
declared
he
and
his
brother
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
for
the
last
ten
years
his
philanthropy
is
honest
and
his
money
is
as
clean
as
any
fortune
can
the
statement
was
not
challenged
sybert
was
known
to
be
howard
copley
s
friend
and
he
further
carried
the
reputation
of
being
a
warm
partizan
on
the
one
or
two
subjects
which
engaged
his
those
which
did
not
engage
it
he
was
nonchalant
to
a
degree
for
a
rising
diplomat
the
and
the
a
nod
to
the
group
presently
drifted
onward
toward
the
door
the
secretary
was
bent
upon
departure
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
teas
were
a
part
of
the
official
routine
of
his
life
but
by
the
simple
device
of
coming
late
and
leaving
early
he
escaped
as
much
of
their
irksomeness
as
possible
aside
from
being
secretary
of
the
embassy
sybert
was
a
nephew
of
the
ambassador
and
it
was
the
latter
calling
which
he
found
the
more
onerous
burden
of
the
two
his
excellency
had
formed
a
troublesome
habit
of
shifting
social
burdens
to
the
unwilling
shoulders
of
the
younger
man
they
paused
at
copley
s
elbow
with
outstretched
hands
and
were
received
with
a
flattering
show
of
cordiality
from
the
aunt
though
with
but
a
fleeting
nod
from
the
niece
she
was
patently
too
interested
in
her
officers
to
have
much
attention
left
where
is
your
husband
sybert
asked
the
lady
raised
her
eyebrows
in
a
picturesque
gesture
beggars
she
sighed
something
has
happened
to
the
beggars
copley
s
latest
philanthropic
venture
had
been
the
had
been
introduced
the
beggars
were
being
hunted
down
and
given
work
and
as
a
result
copley
s
name
was
cursed
from
end
to
end
of
rome
the
men
smilingly
murmured
their
commiserations
and
what
are
you
two
diplomats
doing
here
copley
asked
i
thought
that
dessart
invited
only
artists
to
his
sybert
s
gloomy
air
as
he
eyed
the
door
reflected
the
question
it
was
melville
who
answered
oh
we
are
admirers
of
art
even
if
we
are
not
practitioners
besides
dessart
and
i
are
old
friends
we
used
to
know
each
other
in
pittsburg
when
he
was
a
boy
and
i
was
a
good
deal
younger
than
i
am
his
gaze
rested
for
a
moment
upon
their
host
who
formed
one
of
the
hilarious
group
about
miss
copley
he
was
an
eminently
picturesque
young
fellow
fitted
with
the
usual
artist
velveteen
jacket
a
flowing
necktie
and
rather
long
hair
which
constantly
got
into
his
eyes
causing
him
to
shake
his
head
impatiently
as
he
talked
he
had
an
open
frank
face
humorous
blue
eyes
and
the
inestimable
eager
air
of
being
in
love
with
life
the
conversation
showing
signs
of
becoming
general
the
officers
with
visible
reluctance
made
their
bows
and
gave
place
to
the
the
girl
now
found
time
to
extend
a
cordial
hand
to
melville
while
to
the
secretary
she
tossed
a
markedly
careless
good
afternoon
if
miss
marcia
s
offhand
manner
conveyed
something
a
trifle
stronger
than
indifference
so
sybert
s
smile
as
he
talked
to
her
suggested
that
her
unkindness
failed
to
hurt
that
she
was
too
young
to
count
and
what
is
this
i
hear
about
your
moving
out
to
a
villa
for
the
spring
he
inquired
turning
to
copley
yes
we
are
thinking
of
it
but
it
is
not
decided
we
still
have
uncle
howard
to
deal
with
added
the
girl
he
was
the
first
one
who
suggested
a
villa
but
now
that
exactly
the
right
one
presents
itself
we
very
much
suspect
him
of
trying
to
back
that
will
never
do
miss
marcia
said
melville
you
must
hold
him
to
his
we
are
going
out
to
inspect
it
and
if
aunt
katherine
and
i
are
she
broke
off
with
a
graceful
gesture
which
intimated
much
sybert
laughed
poor
uncle
howard
he
murmured
the
arrival
of
fresh
guests
called
their
host
away
and
copley
and
melville
turning
aside
to
greet
some
friends
left
miss
copley
for
the
moment
to
a
à
with
sybert
he
maintained
his
side
of
the
conversation
in
a
fashion
while
the
girl
allowed
a
slight
touch
of
hostility
to
creep
beneath
her
animation
and
where
is
the
villa
to
be
miss
frascati
i
suppose
farther
away
than
frascati
at
castel
castel
vivalanti
up
in
the
sabine
hills
between
palestrina
and
oh
i
know
where
it
is
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
climbing
the
hill
on
a
very
hot
day
i
was
merely
exclaiming
at
the
locality
it
s
rather
remote
isn
t
it
its
remoteness
is
the
best
thing
about
it
our
object
in
moving
into
the
hills
is
to
escape
from
visitors
and
if
we
go
no
farther
than
frascati
we
shan
t
do
much
this
to
the
family
s
most
frequent
visitor
was
scarcely
a
hospitable
speech
and
a
smile
of
amusement
crept
to
the
corners
of
sybert
s
mouth
apparently
just
becoming
aware
of
the
content
of
her
speech
she
added
with
slightly
exaggerated
sweetness
of
course
i
don
t
mean
you
sybert
you
come
so
often
that
i
regard
you
as
a
member
of
the
the
secretary
apparently
had
it
on
his
tongue
to
retort
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
maintained
a
discreet
silence
while
their
host
approached
with
the
new
lady
whose
name
miss
copley
did
not
catch
but
who
was
presented
with
the
explanatory
remark
she
writes
and
several
young
men
who
she
judged
by
their
neckties
were
artists
also
the
talk
turned
on
the
villa
again
and
miss
copley
was
called
upon
for
a
description
i
haven
t
seen
it
myself
she
returned
but
from
the
steward
s
account
it
is
the
most
complete
villa
in
italy
it
has
a
laurel
walk
and
an
ilex
grove
balconies
fountains
a
marble
terrace
a
view
and
even
a
a
ghost
queried
dessart
but
i
thought
they
were
the
railroads
and
tourists
had
driven
them
all
back
to
the
not
the
ghost
of
the
bad
prince
we
rent
him
with
the
the
most
picturesque
ghost
you
ever
dreamed
of
he
hoarded
his
wheat
while
the
peasants
were
starving
and
they
murdered
him
two
hundred
years
she
repeated
the
story
mimicking
in
inimitable
fashion
the
gestures
and
broken
english
of
prince
vivalanti
s
steward
a
somewhat
startled
silence
hung
over
the
close
of
the
recital
while
her
auditors
glanced
at
each
other
in
secret
amazement
the
question
uppermost
in
their
minds
was
whether
it
was
ignorance
or
mere
bravado
that
had
tempted
her
into
repeating
just
that
particular
tale
it
was
a
subject
which
miss
copley
might
have
been
expected
to
avoid
laurence
sybert
alone
was
aware
that
she
did
not
know
what
a
dangerous
topic
she
was
venturing
on
and
he
received
the
performance
with
an
appreciative
laugh
a
very
picturesque
story
miss
copley
the
old
fellow
got
what
he
marcia
copley
assented
with
a
smiling
gesture
and
the
woman
who
wrote
skilfully
bridged
over
a
second
pause
you
were
complaining
the
other
day
dessart
that
the
foreigners
are
making
the
italians
too
modern
why
do
you
not
catch
the
ghost
he
is
surely
a
true
but
i
am
not
an
impressionist
he
pleaded
who
is
saying
anything
against
impressionists
a
young
man
asked
in
somewhat
halting
english
as
he
paused
beside
the
group
no
one
said
dessart
i
was
merely
disclaiming
all
knowledge
of
them
and
their
ways
miss
copley
allow
me
to
present
monsieur
benoit
the
last
de
is
the
man
to
paint
your
ghost
he
s
an
impressionist
and
paints
nothing
i
suppose
you
have
ghosts
enough
in
the
villa
medici
without
having
to
search
for
them
in
the
sabine
ah
mademoiselle
the
villa
medici
has
ghosts
of
many
of
dead
hopes
and
dead
ambitions
among
i
should
think
the
ghost
of
a
dead
ambition
might
be
too
illusive
for
even
an
impressionist
to
catch
she
returned
perhaps
an
impressionist
is
better
acquainted
with
them
than
with
anything
else
suggested
dessart
a
trifle
unkindly
not
when
he
s
young
and
a
de
smiled
the
woman
who
wrote
copley
requiring
her
niece
s
presence
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
girl
nodded
to
the
group
and
withdrew
the
writer
looked
after
her
with
an
air
of
puzzled
interest
and
doesn
t
miss
copley
read
the
papers
she
inquired
mildly
evidently
she
does
not
sybert
rejoined
with
a
laugh
as
he
made
his
adieus
and
withdrew
half
an
hour
later
marcia
copley
having
made
the
rounds
of
the
room
again
found
herself
as
tea
was
being
served
in
the
neighbourhood
of
her
new
acquaintance
she
dropped
down
on
the
divan
beside
her
with
a
slight
feeling
of
relief
at
being
for
the
moment
out
of
the
current
of
chatter
her
companion
was
a
vivacious
little
woman
approaching
middle
age
and
though
she
spoke
perfect
english
she
pronounced
her
words
with
a
precision
which
suggested
a
foreign
birth
her
conversation
was
diverting
it
gave
evidence
of
a
vast
amount
of
worldly
wisdom
as
well
as
a
wide
acquaintance
with
other
people
s
affairs
and
her
range
of
subjects
was
wide
she
flitted
lightly
from
an
artistic
estimate
of
some
intaglios
of
the
augustan
age
that
had
just
been
dug
up
outside
the
porta
pia
to
a
comparison
of
french
and
italian
dressmakers
and
a
prophecy
as
to
which
cardinal
would
be
the
next
pope
a
portfolio
of
sketches
lay
on
a
little
stand
beside
them
and
she
presently
drew
them
toward
her
with
the
remark
we
will
see
how
our
young
man
has
been
amusing
himself
lately
there
were
a
or
so
of
and
one
or
two
outline
sketches
of
figures
in
red
chalk
none
of
them
was
at
all
finished
but
the
hasty
blocking
in
showed
considerable
vigour
and
the
subjects
were
at
least
original
there
was
no
castle
of
angelo
with
a
boatman
in
the
foreground
and
no
temple
of
vesta
set
off
by
a
line
of
scarlet
seminarists
one
of
the
chalk
drawings
was
of
an
old
chestnut
woman
crouched
over
her
charcoal
fire
another
was
of
the
officer
under
the
tall
arch
of
the
san
giovanni
gate
prodding
the
contents
of
a
with
his
steel
rod
there
were
corners
of
wall
shaded
by
cypresses
bits
of
architectural
adornment
a
quick
sketch
of
the
elephant
s
head
spouting
water
at
villa
madama
they
all
slight
as
they
were
possessed
a
certain
distinction
and
suggested
a
very
real
impression
of
roman
atmosphere
marcia
examined
them
with
interest
they
are
extremely
good
she
said
as
she
laid
the
last
one
down
yes
her
companion
agreed
they
are
so
good
that
they
ought
to
be
they
never
will
how
do
you
mean
i
know
paul
dessart
well
enough
to
know
that
he
will
never
paint
a
picture
he
has
talent
and
he
s
clever
but
he
s
at
everybody
s
service
the
workers
have
no
time
to
be
polite
however
she
finished
it
is
not
for
you
and
me
to
quarrel
with
him
if
he
set
to
work
in
earnest
he
would
stop
giving
teas
and
that
would
be
a
pity
would
it
not
indeed
it
would
she
agreed
how
pretty
the
studio
looks
this
afternoon
i
have
seen
it
only
by
daylight
before
and
like
all
the
rest
of
us
it
improves
by
her
eyes
wandered
about
the
big
room
with
its
furnishings
of
threadbare
tapestry
and
antique
carved
chairs
the
heavy
curtains
had
been
partly
drawn
over
the
windows
making
a
pleasant
twilight
within
a
subtle
odour
of
linseed
oil
and
cigarette
smoke
mingled
with
the
fresh
scent
of
violets
pervaded
the
air
paul
dessart
with
the
de
man
and
a
young
english
sculptor
of
rising
fame
presently
joined
them
and
the
talk
drifted
into
roman
subject
concerning
which
the
artists
declared
with
one
accord
they
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
oh
i
used
to
get
excited
over
their
squabbles
said
the
englishman
but
i
soon
saw
that
i
should
have
to
choose
between
that
and
sculpture
i
hadn
t
time
for
i
don
t
even
know
who
s
premier
put
in
dessart
a
disgraceful
lack
of
interest
maintained
the
american
girl
i
have
only
been
in
rome
two
months
and
i
am
an
authority
on
the
triple
alliance
and
the
abyssinian
war
i
know
what
cavour
wanted
to
do
and
what
crispi
has
that
s
not
fair
miss
copley
dessart
objected
you
ve
been
going
to
functions
at
the
embassy
and
one
can
absorb
politics
there
through
one
s
skin
but
i
warn
you
it
isn
t
a
safe
subject
to
get
interested
in
it
becomes
a
disease
like
the
opium
he
s
not
so
far
from
the
truth
agreed
the
sculptor
i
was
talking
to
a
fellow
this
afternoon
named
sybert
you
know
him
miss
copley
yes
i
know
him
what
about
him
in
that
pray
slander
sybert
if
you
ll
promise
not
to
tell
he
s
one
of
my
uncle
s
friends
not
one
of
oh
i
wasn
t
going
to
slander
him
the
young
man
expostulated
a
trifle
sheepishly
the
only
thing
i
have
against
sybert
is
the
fact
that
my
conversation
bores
marcia
laughed
with
a
certain
sense
of
say
anything
you
please
she
repeated
cordially
my
conversation
bores
him
well
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
he
has
had
about
all
the
roman
politics
that
are
good
for
him
if
he
doesn
t
look
out
he
ll
be
getting
in
too
too
deep
she
queried
it
was
dessart
who
pursued
the
subject
with
just
a
touch
of
malice
laurence
sybert
apparently
was
not
so
popular
a
person
as
a
diplomat
should
be
he
s
lived
in
rome
a
good
many
years
and
people
are
beginning
to
wonder
what
he
s
up
to
the
embassy
does
very
well
for
a
blind
for
he
doesn
t
take
any
more
interest
in
it
than
he
does
in
whether
or
not
tammany
runs
new
york
all
that
sybert
knows
anything
about
or
cares
anything
about
is
italian
politics
and
there
are
some
who
think
that
he
knows
a
good
sight
more
about
them
than
he
ought
he
s
in
with
the
church
party
in
with
the
friends
with
the
right
and
then
with
the
monsieur
sybert
is
what
you
call
an
eclectic
suggested
benoit
he
chooses
the
best
of
i
m
not
so
sure
of
that
dessart
hinted
darkly
he
s
interested
in
other
factions
besides
the
vatican
and
the
quirinal
there
are
one
or
two
pretty
anarchistic
societies
in
rome
and
i
ve
heard
it
you
don
t
she
asked
with
eyes
the
woman
who
wrote
shook
her
head
with
a
laugh
i
suspect
that
sybert
s
long
residence
in
rome
might
be
reduced
to
a
simpler
formula
than
that
it
was
a
very
wise
person
who
first
said
la
oh
really
said
marcia
with
a
new
note
of
interest
laurence
sybert
was
not
a
man
whom
she
had
ever
credited
with
having
emotions
and
the
suggestion
came
as
a
surprise
rumour
says
that
he
still
takes
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
pretty
little
contessa
torrenieri
all
i
know
is
that
nine
or
ten
years
ago
when
she
was
margarita
carretti
he
was
openly
among
her
admirers
but
she
naturally
preferred
a
at
least
her
parents
did
which
in
italy
amounts
to
the
the
girl
s
eyes
opened
still
wider
the
contessa
torrenieri
was
also
a
frequent
guest
at
the
palazzo
but
dessart
received
the
suggestion
with
a
very
sceptical
smile
and
you
think
that
he
is
only
waiting
until
in
the
ripeness
of
time
old
count
torrenieri
goes
the
way
of
all
counts
i
know
you
are
the
authority
on
gossip
madame
but
nevertheless
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
is
laurence
sybert
s
you
don
t
really
mean
that
he
is
an
anarchist
marcia
demanded
i
give
him
up
miss
the
young
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
purely
italian
are
you
talking
politics
asked
copley
as
she
joined
the
group
in
company
with
and
melville
always
politics
laughed
her
or
is
it
sybert
now
they
re
practically
interchangeable
said
dessart
and
did
i
hear
you
calling
him
an
anarchist
miss
marcia
melville
demanded
she
repudiated
the
charge
with
a
laugh
i
m
afraid
dessart
s
the
guilty
here
here
that
will
never
do
sybert
s
a
special
friend
of
mine
i
can
t
allow
you
to
be
accusing
him
of
anything
like
a
little
applied
anarchy
wouldn
t
be
out
of
place
the
young
man
returned
i
feel
tempted
to
use
some
dynamite
myself
when
i
see
the
way
this
precious
government
is
scattering
statues
of
victor
emmanuel
broadcast
through
the
if
you
are
going
to
get
back
into
politics
said
copley
rising
i
fear
we
must
leave
i
know
from
experience
that
it
is
a
long
the
two
turned
away
escorted
to
the
carriage
by
dessart
and
the
frenchman
while
the
rest
of
the
group
resettled
themselves
in
the
empty
places
the
woman
who
wrote
listened
a
moment
to
the
badinage
and
laughter
which
floated
back
through
the
open
door
then
mr
dessart
s
heiress
is
very
attractive
she
suggested
why
dessart
s
melville
inquired
perhaps
i
was
a
little
premature
she
though
i
venture
to
prophesy
not
my
dear
lady
said
melville
impressively
you
do
not
know
copley
her
niece
is
more
likely
to
marry
an
italian
prince
than
a
nameless
young
she
s
no
more
likely
to
marry
an
italian
prince
than
she
is
a
south
african
chief
her
husband
affirmed
miss
marcia
is
a
young
woman
who
will
marry
whom
she
he
added
upon
reflection
i
am
not
at
all
sure
it
will
be
paul
she
might
do
worse
said
his
wife
paul
is
a
nice
she
might
do
better
i
ll
tell
you
exactly
the
man
he
added
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
that
is
laurence
the
suggestion
was
met
by
an
amused
smile
from
the
ladies
and
a
shrug
from
the
sculptor
my
dear
james
said
melville
you
may
be
a
very
good
business
man
but
you
are
no
that
is
a
matter
you
would
best
leave
to
the
women
as
for
your
laurence
sybert
he
hasn
t
the
ghost
of
a
he
doesn
t
want
i
m
doubting
he
has
other
fish
to
fry
just
now
threw
out
the
sculptor
sybert
s
all
right
said
melville
emphatically
the
woman
who
wrote
laughed
as
she
rose
it
will
be
an
interesting
matter
to
watch
she
announced
but
you
may
mark
my
words
that
our
host
is
the
chapter
ii
a
carriage
rumbled
into
the
courtyard
of
the
palazzo
rosicorelli
a
good
twenty
minutes
before
six
o
clock
the
next
evening
and
the
copleys
descended
and
climbed
the
stairs
at
peace
with
villa
vivalanti
and
its
thirty
miles
though
it
was
still
light
out
of
doors
inside
the
palace
with
its
windows
and
heavy
curtains
it
was
already
quite
dark
as
they
entered
the
long
salon
the
only
light
in
the
room
came
from
a
candlestick
on
the
which
threw
its
reflection
upon
gerald
s
white
and
little
bare
knees
as
he
sat
back
solemnly
in
a
carved
savonarola
chair
at
the
sound
of
their
arrival
he
wriggled
down
quickly
and
precipitated
himself
against
copley
oh
mamma
sybert
came
to
tea
an
i
made
it
an
he
said
it
was
lots
better
van
marcia
s
tea
an
he
dwank
seven
cups
an
i
dwank
a
chorus
of
laughter
greeted
this
revelation
and
a
lazy
voice
called
from
the
depths
of
an
easy
chair
oh
i
say
gerald
you
mustn
t
tell
such
shocking
tales
or
your
mother
will
never
leave
me
alone
with
the
and
the
owner
of
the
voice
pulled
himself
together
and
walked
across
the
room
ta
shake
hands
with
the
laurence
sybert
as
he
advanced
toward
his
hostess
threw
a
long
thin
shadow
against
the
wall
he
had
a
spare
dark
face
with
sullen
eyes
he
was
a
delightfully
perfected
type
of
the
cosmopolitan
it
would
have
taken
a
second
or
very
possibly
a
third
glance
to
determine
his
nationality
but
if
the
expression
of
his
face
were
italian
oriental
anything
you
please
his
build
was
undoubtedly
further
a
certain
wiriness
beneath
his
movements
proclaimed
him
to
any
one
familiar
with
the
riders
of
the
plains
unmistakably
american
your
son
slanders
me
copley
he
said
as
he
held
out
his
hand
i
didn
t
drink
but
six
upon
my
hello
sybert
anything
happened
in
rome
what
s
the
news
on
the
rialto
was
copley
s
greeting
marcia
regarded
him
with
a
laugh
as
she
drew
off
her
gloves
and
lighted
the
we
ve
been
away
since
nine
this
morning
and
here
s
uncle
howard
thirsting
for
news
already
what
he
will
do
when
we
really
get
out
of
the
city
i
can
t
oh
and
so
you
ve
taken
the
villa
have
you
marcia
nodded
and
you
should
see
it
it
looks
like
a
papal
palace
this
is
the
first
time
that
prince
vivalanti
has
ever
consented
to
rent
it
to
strangers
it
s
his
official
very
condescending
of
him
the
young
man
laughed
and
do
you
accept
his
responsibilities
along
with
the
place
from
the
fattore
s
account
i
should
say
that
his
responsibilities
rest
but
lightly
on
the
prince
of
s
true
do
you
know
him
only
by
hearsay
i
know
the
village
and
a
more
desperate
little
place
it
would
be
hard
to
find
in
all
the
sabine
hills
the
people
s
love
for
their
prince
is
tempered
by
the
need
of
a
number
of
improvements
which
he
doesn
t
i
dare
say
they
are
pretty
poor
she
conceded
but
they
are
unbelievably
picturesque
every
person
there
looks
as
if
he
had
just
walked
out
of
a
sketch
even
uncle
howard
was
pleased
and
he
has
lived
here
so
long
that
he
is
losing
his
it
is
a
pretty
decent
sort
of
a
place
copley
agreed
though
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
we
may
find
it
rather
far
but
the
rest
of
the
family
liked
it
and
my
aim
in
nonsense
uncle
howard
you
know
you
were
crazy
over
it
yourself
you
signed
the
lease
without
a
protest
didn
t
he
aunt
katherine
i
signed
the
lease
my
dear
marcia
at
the
point
of
the
the
point
of
the
pistol
you
threatened
if
we
got
a
inch
i
believe
you
rome
you
would
give
a
party
every
day
and
if
that
isn
t
the
point
of
a
pistol
to
a
poor
man
like
me
i
don
t
know
what
it
would
certainly
seem
like
it
sybert
agreed
and
turning
to
marcia
he
added
i
am
afraid
that
you
rule
with
a
very
despotic
hand
miss
marcia
s
eyebrows
went
up
a
barely
perceptible
trifle
but
she
laughed
and
returned
no
indeed
sybert
you
are
mistaken
there
it
is
not
i
but
gerald
who
plays
the
part
of
despot
in
the
copley
at
this
point
granton
copley
s
english
maid
appeared
in
the
doorway
marietta
is
waiting
to
give
master
gerald
his
supper
she
announced
gerald
fled
to
his
mother
and
raised
a
cry
of
protest
mamma
please
let
me
stay
up
to
dinner
wif
you
for
a
moment
copley
looked
as
if
she
might
consent
but
catching
sight
of
granton
s
relentless
face
she
returned
no
my
dear
you
have
had
enough
festivity
for
one
evening
you
must
have
your
tea
and
go
to
bed
like
a
good
little
gerald
abandoned
his
mother
and
entrenched
himself
behind
sybert
cause
sybert
s
here
an
i
like
sybert
he
wailed
desperately
but
granton
stormed
even
this
fortress
come
master
gerald
your
supper
s
getting
cold
and
she
laid
a
firm
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
marched
him
away
there
s
the
real
despot
laughed
copley
i
tremble
before
granton
pietro
appeared
with
a
plate
of
toasted
muffins
and
the
evening
mail
copley
settled
himself
in
a
wicker
chair
with
a
pile
of
letters
on
the
arm
at
his
right
and
as
he
ran
his
eyes
over
them
one
by
one
he
tore
them
in
pieces
and
formed
a
new
pile
at
his
left
they
were
begging
letters
for
the
most
part
he
received
a
great
many
and
this
was
his
usual
method
of
answering
them
not
that
he
was
an
ungenerous
man
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
principle
with
him
not
to
be
generous
in
this
particular
way
as
he
sat
disposing
of
envelope
after
envelope
with
vigorous
hands
copley
s
appearance
suggested
a
series
of
somewhat
puzzling
contrasts
seriousness
and
humour
sensitiveness
and
active
impulse
to
forge
ahead
and
accomplish
things
a
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
wonder
why
he
was
a
puzzle
to
most
of
his
friends
at
times
even
one
to
his
wife
but
she
had
accepted
his
eccentricities
along
with
his
millions
and
though
she
did
not
always
understand
either
his
motives
of
his
actions
she
made
no
complaint
to
most
men
a
fortune
is
a
blessing
to
copley
it
was
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
curse
he
might
have
amounted
to
almost
anything
had
he
had
to
work
for
it
but
for
the
one
field
of
activity
which
a
fortune
in
america
seems
to
entail
upon
its
of
entering
the
arena
and
doubling
and
tripling
was
singularly
unfitted
both
by
temperament
and
inclination
in
this
he
differed
from
his
elder
brother
and
there
was
one
other
point
in
which
the
two
were
at
variance
though
their
father
had
been
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
a
just
and
upright
man
still
in
the
battle
of
competition
many
had
fallen
that
he
might
stand
and
the
younger
son
had
grown
up
with
the
knowledge
that
from
a
humanitarian
standpoint
the
money
was
not
irreproachable
he
had
the
his
brother
characterized
as
with
his
share
of
the
fortune
he
would
like
in
a
measure
to
make
it
up
to
mankind
howard
copley
s
first
move
in
the
game
of
benefiting
humanity
had
been
not
very
originally
an
attempt
at
solving
the
negro
problem
but
the
negroes
were
ever
a
leisurely
race
and
copley
was
a
man
impatient
for
results
he
finally
abandoned
them
to
the
course
of
evolution
and
engaged
in
a
spasmodic
orgy
of
east
side
politics
becoming
disgusted
and
failing
of
an
election
he
looked
aimlessly
about
for
a
further
object
in
life
it
was
at
this
point
that
copley
breathlessly
suggested
a
year
in
paris
for
the
sake
of
gerald
s
french
the
child
was
only
four
but
one
could
not
as
she
justly
pointed
out
begin
the
study
of
the
languages
too
early
her
husband
apathetically
consenting
they
embarked
for
paris
by
the
roundabout
route
of
the
mediterranean
landed
in
naples
and
there
they
stayed
he
had
found
a
fascinating
occupation
ready
to
his
of
helping
on
the
work
of
good
government
in
this
still
turbulent
portion
of
united
italy
after
a
year
the
family
drifted
to
rome
and
settled
themselves
in
the
of
the
palazzo
rosicorelli
with
something
of
an
air
of
permanence
copley
was
at
last
thoroughly
contented
he
had
no
racial
prejudices
and
rome
was
as
fair
a
field
of
reform
as
new
infinitely
more
diverting
if
the
italians
did
not
always
understand
his
motives
still
they
accepted
his
services
with
a
fair
show
of
gratitude
as
for
copley
she
had
by
no
means
intended
their
sojourn
to
be
an
emigration
but
she
reflected
that
her
husband
had
to
be
amused
in
some
way
and
that
reforming
italian
posterity
was
perhaps
an
harmless
a
way
as
he
could
have
devised
she
settled
herself
very
contentedly
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
somewhat
shifting
foreign
society
of
the
capital
with
only
an
occasional
plaintive
reference
to
her
friends
in
new
york
and
to
gerald
s
french
marcia
leaning
back
in
her
chair
watched
her
uncle
dispose
of
his
correspondence
with
a
visible
air
of
amusement
he
had
a
thin
nervous
face
traced
with
fine
lines
a
sharply
cut
jaw
and
a
mouth
which
twitched
easily
into
a
smile
however
as
he
ripped
open
envelope
after
envelope
he
frowned
oftener
than
he
smiled
and
presently
as
he
unfolded
one
letter
he
suppressed
a
quick
exclamation
of
anger
read
that
he
said
shortly
tossing
it
to
the
other
man
sybert
perused
it
with
no
visible
change
of
expression
and
leaning
over
he
dropped
it
into
the
open
grate
marcia
laughed
outright
your
mail
doesn
t
seem
to
afford
you
much
satisfaction
uncle
a
large
share
of
it
s
anonymous
and
not
all
of
it
s
that
is
what
you
must
expect
if
you
will
hound
those
poor
old
beggars
to
the
two
men
shot
each
other
a
look
of
rather
grim
amusement
the
letter
in
question
had
nothing
to
do
with
beggars
but
copley
had
no
intention
of
discussing
its
contents
with
his
niece
i
find
that
the
usual
reward
of
virtue
in
this
world
is
an
anonymous
letter
he
remarked
shrugging
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
settling
himself
comfortably
to
his
tea
the
guest
refused
the
cup
proffered
him
i
haven
t
the
courage
he
declared
after
gerald
s
by
the
way
sybert
said
copley
i
have
been
hearing
some
bad
stories
about
you
my
niece
doesn
t
like
to
have
me
associate
with
marcia
looked
at
her
uncle
helplessly
when
he
once
commenced
teasing
there
was
no
telling
where
he
would
stop
i
am
sorry
said
sybert
humbly
what
is
the
trouble
she
has
found
out
that
you
are
an
both
men
laughed
and
marcia
flushed
slightly
please
miss
marcia
sybert
begged
give
me
time
to
get
out
of
the
country
before
you
expose
me
to
the
there
s
no
cause
for
fear
she
returned
i
didn
t
believe
the
story
when
i
heard
it
for
i
knew
that
you
haven
t
energy
enough
to
run
away
from
a
bomb
much
less
throw
one
that
s
why
it
surprised
me
that
other
people
should
believe
but
most
people
have
a
better
opinion
of
me
than
you
have
he
expostulated
no
indeed
sybert
i
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
than
most
people
i
really
consider
you
the
young
man
laughed
and
bowed
his
thanks
while
he
turned
his
attention
to
copley
i
hope
that
villa
vivalanti
will
prove
more
successful
than
the
one
in
copley
looked
at
him
reproachfully
that
horrible
man
i
never
think
of
him
without
wishing
we
were
safely
back
in
then
please
don
t
think
of
him
her
husband
returned
he
is
where
he
won
t
trouble
you
any
what
man
asked
marcia
emerging
from
a
dignified
silence
is
it
possible
miss
marcia
has
never
heard
of
the
tattooed
man
sybert
inquired
gravely
the
tattooed
man
what
you
talking
about
it
has
a
somewhat
theatrical
ring
copley
admitted
it
is
nothing
to
make
light
of
said
his
wife
it
s
a
wonder
to
me
that
we
escaped
with
our
lives
three
years
ago
while
we
were
in
naples
she
added
to
her
niece
your
uncle
with
his
usual
recklessness
got
mixed
up
with
one
of
the
secret
societies
our
villa
was
out
toward
posilipo
and
one
afternoon
i
was
driving
home
at
about
had
been
shopping
in
the
just
as
we
reached
a
lonely
place
in
the
road
between
two
high
copley
broke
in
a
masked
man
armed
to
the
teeth
sprang
up
in
the
path
with
a
horrible
not
really
marcia
cried
leaning
forward
delightedly
aunt
katherine
a
masked
he
wasn
t
masked
but
i
wish
he
had
been
he
would
have
looked
less
ferocious
he
came
straight
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
taking
off
his
hat
with
a
very
polite
bow
he
said
that
unless
we
left
naples
in
three
days
your
uncle
s
life
would
no
longer
be
safe
his
shirt
was
open
at
the
throat
and
there
was
a
crucifix
tattooed
upside
down
on
his
breast
you
can
imagine
what
a
desperate
character
he
must
have
in
italy
of
all
places
where
the
people
are
so
the
two
men
laughed
at
the
climax
what
did
you
do
marcia
asked
i
was
too
shocked
to
speak
and
gerald
poor
child
screamed
all
the
way
and
did
you
leave
the
city
as
it
happened
we
were
leaving
anyway
her
uncle
put
in
but
we
postponed
our
departure
long
enough
for
me
to
hunt
the
fellow
down
and
put
him
in
you
may
be
thankful
that
they
had
the
decency
to
warn
you
sybert
remarked
it
s
like
a
dime
novel
marcia
sighed
to
be
mixed
up
with
murders
and
warnings
and
tattooed
men
and
secret
didn
t
you
send
for
me
uncle
howard
well
you
see
i
didn
t
know
that
you
had
grown
up
into
such
a
charming
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
i
had
all
that
i
could
do
to
take
care
of
one
that
s
the
way
she
complained
just
because
one
s
a
girl
one
is
always
shut
up
in
the
house
while
there
s
anything
exciting
going
if
you
are
so
fond
of
bloodshed
sybert
suggested
you
may
possibly
have
a
chance
of
seeing
some
this
this
spring
is
the
camorra
making
trouble
again
oh
no
not
the
camorra
but
unless
all
signs
fail
there
is
a
prospect
of
some
fairly
exciting
really
here
in
rome
well
no
probably
not
in
are
too
many
soldiers
more
likely
in
the
neapolitan
provinces
i
am
sorry
he
added
since
you
seem
to
find
them
so
entertaining
that
we
can
t
promise
you
a
riot
on
your
own
but
i
dare
say
when
it
comes
to
the
point
you
ll
find
naples
near
i
give
you
fair
warning
uncle
howard
she
said
if
there
are
any
riots
in
naples
i
m
going
down
to
see
them
what
is
the
trouble
what
are
they
rioting
about
if
there
are
any
riots
said
her
uncle
you
my
dear
young
lady
will
amuse
yourself
at
villa
vivalanti
until
they
are
over
and
he
abruptly
changed
the
subject
the
talk
drifted
back
to
the
villa
again
copley
afforded
their
guest
a
more
detailed
description
nineteen
bedrooms
aside
from
the
servants
quarters
and
room
in
the
stable
for
thirty
horses
she
finished
the
princes
of
vivalanti
must
have
kept
up
an
establishment
in
their
mustn
t
they
agreed
marcia
cordially
the
new
villa
was
proving
an
unexpectedly
soothing
topic
we
ll
keep
up
an
establishment
too
she
added
we
re
going
to
give
a
when
the
roystons
come
down
from
paris
know
what
we
ll
do
we
ll
give
a
ball
for
my
t
we
uncle
howard
and
have
everybody
out
from
rome
and
the
ilex
grove
all
lighted
with
coloured
lamps
not
if
i
have
anything
to
say
about
it
said
copley
but
you
won
t
have
said
marcia
the
only
reason
that
i
consented
to
take
this
villa
was
that
i
thought
it
was
far
enough
away
to
escape
parties
for
a
time
you
i
said
if
you
got
nearer
rome
we
d
give
a
party
day
while
as
it
is
i
m
only
planning
one
party
for
all
the
three
sybert
and
i
won
t
come
to
it
he
grumbled
perhaps
you
and
sybert
won
t
be
i
don
t
know
where
you
d
find
two
such
charming
men
said
copley
rome
s
full
of
them
returned
marcia
imperturbably
who
are
the
roystons
miss
marcia
sybert
inquired
they
are
the
friends
i
came
over
with
last
fall
you
know
dessart
the
artist
yes
i
know
well
royston
is
his
aunt
and
she
has
two
daughters
are
his
cousins
suggested
copley
yes
to
be
sure
and
very
charming
girls
they
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
over
least
royston
and
eleanor
do
margaret
has
been
in
and
royston
asked
copley
stays
in
america
and
attends
to
his
business
yes
royston
and
eleanor
go
over
quite
often
to
keep
him
from
getting
very
generous
of
them
sybert
laughed
they
ve
spent
winters
in
cairo
and
vienna
and
paris
and
a
lot
of
different
places
pursued
marcia
eleanor
she
added
ruminatingly
has
been
out
nine
seasons
and
she
has
had
a
good
deal
dear
dear
said
her
uncle
and
you
are
proposing
to
expose
all
she
s
very
attractive
said
marcia
and
then
she
glanced
at
sybert
and
laughed
if
she
should
happen
to
take
a
fancy
to
you
the
young
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
for
his
hat
goodness
he
murmured
what
would
she
do
there
s
no
marcia
regarded
him
with
a
speculative
light
in
her
eyes
a
young
woman
who
has
been
practising
for
nine
seasons
certainly
ought
to
have
her
hand
in
copley
agreed
perhaps
after
all
sybert
it
is
best
we
should
not
meet
sybert
found
his
hat
and
paused
for
a
moment
you
can
t
frighten
me
that
way
miss
marcia
he
said
with
a
shake
of
his
head
i
have
been
out
thirteen
seasons
chapter
iii
may
i
come
in
for
tea
cousin
marcia
gerald
inquired
with
a
note
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
as
they
climbed
the
stone
staircase
of
the
palazzo
rosicorelli
they
had
been
spending
the
afternoon
in
the
borghese
gardens
and
the
boy
s
very
damp
bore
witness
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
indulging
in
the
forbidden
pleasure
of
catching
goldfish
in
the
fountain
indeed
you
may
not
she
returned
emphatically
you
may
go
with
marietta
and
have
some
dry
clothes
put
on
before
your
mother
sees
gerald
realizing
the
wisdom
of
this
course
allowed
himself
to
be
quietly
spirited
off
the
back
way
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
heard
the
alluring
sound
of
sybert
s
voice
in
the
direction
of
the
salon
marcia
went
on
in
without
waiting
to
take
off
her
hat
and
she
met
the
melvilles
in
the
on
the
point
of
leaving
good
afternoon
why
do
you
go
so
early
she
asked
oh
we
are
coming
back
later
we
are
just
going
home
to
dress
your
uncle
is
giving
a
dinner
very
formal
is
that
so
she
laughed
i
have
not
been
you
will
be
don
t
feel
hurt
it
s
a
general
invitation
issued
to
all
marcia
found
no
one
within
but
her
aunt
and
uncle
and
sybert
what
is
this
i
hear
about
your
giving
a
dinner
aunt
katherine
she
asked
as
she
settled
herself
in
a
wicker
chair
and
stretched
out
her
hand
for
a
cup
of
tea
you
must
ask
your
uncle
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
copley
disclaimed
he
invited
the
guests
and
he
must
provide
the
what
is
it
uncle
howard
merely
a
little
farewell
dinner
i
thought
we
ought
to
put
on
a
bright
face
our
last
night
you
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
be
led
to
execution
at
we
will
hope
it
s
nothing
worse
than
exile
said
sybert
who
are
your
guests
and
when
were
they
invited
my
guests
are
the
people
who
dropped
in
late
to
tea
i
did
not
think
of
it
early
enough
to
make
the
invitation
very
general
the
list
i
believe
includes
the
melvilles
signora
androit
and
the
contessa
torrenieri
sidney
carthrope
the
sculptor
and
a
certain
young
frenchman
a
most
alluring
youth
who
called
with
him
but
whose
name
for
the
moment
escapes
adolphe
benoit
said
sybert
the
de
asked
marcia
oh
i
know
him
i
met
him
a
few
weeks
ago
at
a
tea
he
s
very
entertaining
i
suppose
she
added
considering
the
list
that
he
will
fall
to
my
share
unless
you
prefer
an
embarrassing
predicament
miss
marcia
sybert
laughed
if
it
will
facilitate
matters
we
can
draw
not
at
all
said
marcia
graciously
i
know
the
contessa
would
rather
have
you
and
as
she
is
the
guest
i
will
let
her
choose
i
hope
your
dinner
will
be
a
success
she
added
to
her
uncle
but
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
you
show
a
touching
faith
in
the
thank
you
my
dear
i
am
of
an
optimistic
turn
of
mind
and
françois
has
never
failed
me
did
the
borghese
gallery
go
very
well
i
met
dessart
i
met
the
king
ah
i
hope
his
majesty
was
enjoying
good
health
he
seemed
to
be
i
didn
t
stop
to
speak
to
him
but
there
was
a
boy
in
a
group
of
seminarists
near
us
who
called
out
viva
il
papa
just
as
he
and
what
happened
sybert
inquired
did
the
king
s
guard
behead
him
on
the
spot
or
did
they
only
send
him
to
the
galleys
for
life
the
king
s
guard
fortunately
had
eyes
only
for
the
king
and
the
old
priest
gathered
his
flock
together
and
scuttled
off
down
one
of
the
side
paths
as
frightened
as
a
hen
who
sees
a
and
with
good
wait
till
the
lads
grow
up
and
they
ll
do
something
besides
shout
and
there
was
an
undertone
in
sybert
s
voice
different
from
his
usual
listless
drawl
marcia
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
and
dessart
s
insinuations
flashed
through
her
mind
do
you
mean
you
would
rather
have
leo
xiii
king
instead
of
humbert
she
asked
heavens
no
no
one
wants
the
temporal
power
even
the
catholics
i
should
think
that
when
the
italians
have
gone
through
so
much
to
get
their
king
they
might
be
satisfied
with
him
they
ought
to
have
more
patience
and
not
expect
the
country
to
be
rich
in
a
minute
everything
can
t
be
done
all
at
once
and
as
for
blaming
the
government
because
the
african
war
didn
t
turn
out
no
one
could
foresee
the
result
it
was
a
mistake
instead
of
a
sybert
was
watching
her
lazily
with
an
amused
smile
about
his
lips
will
you
pardon
me
miss
marcia
if
i
ask
if
those
are
your
own
conclusions
or
the
opinions
of
our
young
friend
the
american
artist
he
does
not
plot
against
the
king
at
any
rate
she
retorted
please
miss
marcia
he
begged
don
t
think
so
badly
of
me
as
that
really
i
m
not
an
anarchist
i
don
t
want
to
blow
his
majesty
go
home
and
dress
sybert
copley
murmured
taking
him
by
the
arm
i
have
to
go
and
interview
the
cook
and
i
don
t
dare
leave
you
and
my
niece
together
there
s
no
telling
what
would
she
s
a
suspicious
young
woman
sybert
complained
can
t
you
teach
her
to
take
your
friends
on
trust
for
the
matter
of
that
she
doesn
t
even
take
her
uncle
on
and
no
wonder
said
marcia
i
forgot
to
tell
you
my
other
adventure
just
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
corso
we
got
jammed
in
close
to
the
curb
and
had
to
stop
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
glaring
at
me
over
the
top
of
a
suddenly
he
jumped
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
thrust
the
paper
in
my
hands
he
said
something
in
italian
but
too
fast
for
me
to
catch
and
before
i
could
move
marietta
had
snatched
it
up
and
dashed
it
back
in
his
face
the
paper
was
named
the
of
the
i
just
caught
one
word
in
it
and
that
she
paused
copley
now
uncle
howard
she
finished
do
you
think
you
ought
to
be
trusted
when
it
gets
to
the
point
that
the
people
in
the
she
stopped
suddenly
she
had
caught
a
quick
glance
between
her
uncle
and
sybert
what
is
it
she
asked
do
you
know
what
it
means
it
means
damned
impudence
said
her
uncle
i
ll
have
that
editor
arrested
if
he
doesn
t
keep
still
and
the
two
men
stood
eyeing
each
other
a
minute
in
silence
then
copley
gave
a
short
laugh
oh
well
he
said
i
don
t
believe
the
del
can
destroy
my
character
nobody
reads
he
looked
at
his
watch
you
d
better
go
and
dress
marcia
my
party
begins
promptly
at
you
needn
t
use
any
such
clumsy
method
as
that
of
getting
rid
of
me
she
laughed
i
m
not
going
to
stay
where
i
m
not
wanted
all
i
have
to
say
she
called
back
from
the
doorway
is
that
you
d
better
stop
badgering
those
poor
old
beggars
or
you
ll
be
getting
a
warning
to
leave
rome
as
well
as
marcia
rang
for
granton
have
you
time
to
fix
my
hair
now
she
inquired
as
the
maid
appeared
or
does
copley
need
you
mrs
copley
hasn
t
begun
to
dress
yet
she
is
watching
master
gerald
eat
his
oh
very
well
then
there
is
time
enough
i
ll
get
through
before
she
is
ready
for
you
do
my
hair
sort
of
frenchy
she
commanded
as
she
sat
down
before
the
mirror
what
dress
do
you
think
i
d
better
wear
she
continued
presently
that
white
one
i
wore
last
week
or
the
new
green
one
that
came
from
paris
yesterday
i
should
think
the
white
one
miss
marcia
and
save
the
new
one
for
some
it
would
be
more
sensible
marcia
agreed
but
she
added
with
a
laugh
i
think
i
ll
wear
the
new
granton
got
it
out
with
an
unsmiling
face
which
was
meant
to
convey
the
fact
that
she
could
not
countenance
this
american
prodigality
she
had
lived
ten
years
with
an
elderly
english
duchess
and
had
thought
that
she
knew
the
ways
of
the
aristocracy
the
gown
was
a
filmy
green
mousseline
touched
with
rose
velvet
and
yellow
lace
marcia
put
it
on
and
surveyed
herself
critically
what
do
you
think
granton
she
asked
it
s
very
becoming
miss
marcia
granton
returned
primly
yes
marcia
and
very
tight
she
caught
up
her
fan
and
turned
toward
the
door
don
t
be
hurt
because
i
didn
t
take
your
advice
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
i
never
take
anybody
s
she
found
her
uncle
alone
in
the
salon
pacing
the
floor
in
a
restless
fashion
with
two
frowning
lines
between
his
brows
he
paused
in
his
walk
as
she
appeared
and
his
frown
gave
place
readily
enough
to
a
smile
you
look
very
well
he
remarked
approvingly
a
new
gown
haven
t
you
oh
yes
uncle
howard
she
laughed
it
s
all
the
gown
send
your
compliments
to
my
dressmaker
avenue
de
l
opéra
i
thought
i
would
wear
it
in
honour
of
sybert
it
s
so
seldom
we
have
him
with
copley
received
this
statement
with
something
like
a
grunt
there
uncle
howard
i
didn
t
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
sybert
is
the
nicest
man
that
ever
lived
and
what
i
particularly
like
about
him
is
the
fact
that
he
is
so
genial
and
expansive
and
thoughtful
for
trying
to
put
people
at
their
copley
refused
to
smile
i
am
sorry
marcia
that
you
don
t
like
sybert
he
said
quietly
it
s
because
you
don
t
understand
i
dare
say
and
i
suppose
he
doesn
t
like
me
for
the
same
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
i
ve
never
known
a
better
a
man
can
marcia
laughed
uncle
howard
do
you
know
what
you
remind
me
of
an
italian
father
who
is
arranging
a
marriage
for
his
daughter
and
having
chosen
the
man
is
recommending
him
for
her
oh
no
i
don
t
go
to
the
length
of
asking
you
to
fall
in
love
with
you
might
do
i
should
be
pleased
if
you
would
treat
respectfully
as
i
would
my
more
respectfully
than
you
do
your
uncle
at
any
rate
he
may
not
be
exactly
what
you
d
call
a
lady
s
a
lady
s
man
uncle
howard
you
make
me
furious
when
you
talk
like
that
as
if
i
only
liked
men
with
dimples
in
their
chins
who
dance
well
and
get
ices
for
you
i
m
sorry
if
i
don
t
treat
sybert
seriously
enough
but
really
i
don
t
think
he
treats
me
seriously
either
you
think
i
don
t
know
anything
just
because
i
can
t
tell
the
difference
between
the
left
and
the
right
i
ve
only
just
come
to
rome
and
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
expect
me
to
know
about
italian
politics
you
both
of
you
laugh
whenever
i
ask
the
simplest
but
you
ask
such
exceedingly
simple
questions
how
can
i
help
it
when
you
give
me
such
absurd
answers
i
m
sorry
we
ll
try
to
do
better
in
the
future
i
suppose
we
ve
both
of
us
been
a
little
worried
this
spring
and
you
probe
us
on
a
tender
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
s
being
really
worried
over
is
unless
he
s
running
for
something
they
should
be
regarded
as
an
amusement
to
while
away
your
leisure
you
and
sybert
are
so
funny
uncle
howard
you
take
your
amusements
so
politics
is
a
broad
word
marcia
he
returned
with
a
slight
frown
and
when
it
stands
for
oppression
and
injustice
and
starving
peasants
it
has
to
be
taken
is
it
really
so
bad
uncle
howard
good
heavens
marcia
it
s
awful
she
was
startled
at
his
tone
and
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
he
was
staring
at
the
light
with
a
hard
look
in
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
drawn
into
a
straight
line
i
m
sorry
uncle
howard
i
didn
t
know
what
can
i
do
what
can
any
of
us
do
he
asked
bitterly
we
can
give
one
day
and
it
s
eaten
up
before
night
and
we
can
keep
on
giving
but
what
does
it
amount
to
the
whole
thing
is
rotten
from
the
can
t
the
people
get
work
no
and
when
they
can
their
earnings
are
eaten
up
in
taxes
the
people
in
the
southern
provinces
are
literally
starving
i
tell
you
and
it
s
worse
this
year
than
usual
thanks
to
men
like
your
father
and
what
do
you
mean
for
a
moment
he
felt
almost
impelled
to
tell
her
the
truth
then
as
he
glanced
down
at
her
he
stopped
himself
quickly
she
looked
so
delicate
so
patrician
so
aloof
from
everything
that
was
sordid
and
miserable
she
could
not
help
and
it
was
better
that
she
should
not
know
what
do
you
mean
she
repeated
what
has
papa
been
doing
oh
nothing
very
criminal
he
returned
only
at
a
time
like
this
one
feels
as
if
one
s
money
were
a
reproach
italy
s
in
a
bad
way
just
now
the
wheat
crop
failed
last
year
and
that
makes
it
inconvenient
for
people
who
live
on
do
you
mean
the
people
really
haven
t
anything
to
eat
not
how
terrible
uncle
howard
won
t
the
government
do
anything
the
government
is
doing
what
it
can
there
was
a
riot
in
florence
last
month
and
they
lowered
the
grain
tax
king
humbert
gave
nine
thousand
lire
to
feed
the
people
of
pisa
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
you
can
do
the
same
for
some
other
city
if
you
want
to
play
at
being
a

thought
you
believed
in
finding
them
work
instead
giving
them
oh
as
a
matter
of
principle
certainly
but
you
can
t
have
em
dying
on
your
you
and
to
think
we
re
having
a
dinner
when
we
re
not
the
slightest
bit
hungry
i
m
afraid
our
dinner
wouldn
t
go
far
toward
feeding
the
hungry
in
how
does
my
dress
look
my
dear
asked
copley
appearing
in
the
doorway
i
have
been
so
bothered
over
it
she
didn
t
fix
the
lace
at
all
as
i
told
her
these
italian
dressmakers
are
not
to
be
depended
upon
i
really
should
have
run
up
to
paris
for
a
few
weeks
this
spring
only
you
were
so
unwilling
marcia
looked
at
her
aunt
a
moment
with
eyes
heavens
she
thought
do
i
usually
talk
this
way
no
wonder
sybert
doesn
t
like
me
and
then
she
laughed
i
think
it
looks
lovely
aunt
katherine
and
i
am
sure
it
is
very
the
arrival
of
guests
precluded
any
further
conversation
on
the
subject
of
italian
dressmakers
the
contessa
torrenieri
was
small
and
slender
and
with
a
cloud
of
black
hair
and
dramatic
eyes
she
had
a
pair
of
nervous
little
hands
which
were
never
still
and
a
magnetic
manner
which
brought
the
men
to
her
side
and
created
a
tendency
among
the
women
to
say
spiteful
things
marcia
was
no
exception
to
the
rest
of
her
sex
and
her
comments
on
the
contessa
s
doings
were
frequently
not
prompted
by
a
spirit
of
charitableness
the
contessa
evidently
had
something
on
her
mind
she
barely
finished
her
salutations
before
transferring
her
attention
to
marcia
come
signorina
copley
and
sit
beside
me
on
the
sofa
we
harmonize
so
well
with
a
glance
from
her
own
gown
to
marcia
s
rose
trimmings
i
missed
you
from
tea
this
afternoon
she
added
i
trust
you
had
a
pleasant
a
pleasant
walk
marcia
questioned
off
her
guard
i
passed
you
as
i
was
driving
in
the
borghese
but
you
did
not
see
me
you
were
too
she
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
it
will
not
do
in
italy
my
dear
an
italian
girl
would
never
walk
alone
with
a
young
fortunately
i
am
not
an
italian
you
are
too
strict
contessa
sybert
who
was
sitting
near
put
in
with
a
laugh
if
miss
copley
chooses
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
walk
in
the
gardens
with
a
young
a
girl
of
the
lower
classes
perhaps
but
not
of
signorina
copley
s
class
with
her
dowry
she
will
be
marrying
an
italian
nobleman
one
of
these
marcia
flushed
with
annoyance
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
marrying
an
italian
nobleman
she
returned
one
must
marry
some
one
said
her
companion
melville
relieved
the
tension
by
inquiring
and
who
was
the
hero
of
this
episode
miss
marcia
we
have
not
heard
his
marcia
laughed
your
friend
the
melvilles
exchanged
glances
i
met
him
in
the
gallery
and
as
the
carriage
hadn
t
come
and
gerald
was
playing
in
the
fountain
and
marietta
was
flirting
with
a
gendarme
dear
me
aunt
katherine
i
didn
t
mean
to
say
that
we
strolled
about
until
the
carriage
came
i
m
sure
i
had
no
intention
of
shocking
the
italian
nobility
it
was
quite
if
the
italian
nobility
never
stands
a
worse
shock
than
that
it
is
happier
than
most
nobilities
said
her
uncle
and
the
simultaneous
announcement
of
benoit
and
dinner
created
a
diversion
it
was
a
small
party
and
every
one
felt
the
absence
of
that
preliminary
chill
which
a
long
list
of
guests
invited
two
weeks
beforehand
is
likely
to
produce
they
talked
back
and
forth
across
the
table
and
laughed
and
joked
in
the
unpremeditated
way
that
an
impromptu
affair
calls
forth
marcia
glanced
at
her
uncle
once
or
twice
in
half
perplexity
he
seemed
so
entirely
the
careless
man
of
the
world
as
he
turned
a
laughing
face
to
answer
one
of
melville
s
sallies
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
spoken
so
seriously
to
her
a
few
minutes
before
she
glanced
across
at
sybert
he
was
smiling
at
some
remark
of
the
contessa
s
to
which
he
retorted
in
italian
i
don
t
see
how
any
sensible
man
can
be
interested
in
the
contessa
was
her
inward
comment
as
she
transferred
her
attention
to
the
young
frenchman
at
her
side
whenever
the
conversation
showed
a
tendency
to
linger
on
politics
copley
adroitly
redirected
it
as
she
knew
from
experience
that
the
subject
was
too
combustible
by
far
for
a
italy
italy
these
men
talk
nothing
but
italy
she
complained
to
the
young
frenchman
on
her
right
does
it
not
make
you
homesick
for
the
boulevards
i
suffered
the
nostalgie
once
he
confessed
but
rome
is
a
good
marcia
shook
her
head
in
mock
despair
and
you
too
benoit
patriotism
is
certainly
dying
not
while
you
live
said
her
uncle
oh
i
know
i
m
abnormally
patriotic
she
admitted
but
you
re
all
so
sluggish
in
that
respect
that
you
force
it
upon
there
are
other
useful
virtues
besides
patriotism
sybert
suggested
wait
until
you
have
spent
a
spring
in
the
sabine
hills
miss
copley
melville
put
in
and
you
will
be
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
ah
mademoiselle
benoit
added
fervently
in
the
sabine
hills
will
be
compensation
sufficient
to
most
of
us
for
not
seeing
i
believe
with
my
uncle
it
s
a
kind
of
roman
fever
she
cried
i
never
expected
to
hear
a
frenchman
renounce
his
native
it
is
not
that
i
renounce
france
the
young
man
remonstrated
i
lofe
france
as
much
as
ever
but
i
open
my
arms
to
italy
as
well
to
lofe
another
land
and
peoples
besides
your
own
makes
you
not
littler
but
as
you
say
we
ah
mademoiselle
he
broke
off
if
you
would
let
me
talk
in
french
i
could
say
what
i
mean
but
how
can
one
be
eloquent
in
this
halting
tongue
of
yours
benoit
you
are
doing
bravely
sybert
laughed
we
are
the
young
man
went
on
with
a
sudden
inspiration

you

la

the
the
young

eloquence
was
received
with
an
appreciative
laugh
and
how
about

some
one
suggested
ah
my
friends

is
there
that

tragically

sybert
turned
the
stem
of
his
wine
glass
meditatively
as
he
repeated
the
phrase
it
seems
to
me
in
spite
of
miss
marcia
that
one
can
t
do
much
better
than
that
if
you
re
a
patriotic
citizen
of

you

said
melville
since
this
is
a
farewell
dinner
and
we
are
pledging
toasts
we
should
drink

chapter
iv
the
announcement
that
a
was
coming
to
live
in
villa
vivalanti
occasioned
no
little
excitement
in
the
village
wagons
with
furnishings
from
rome
had
been
seen
to
pass
on
the
road
below
the
town
and
the
contadini
in
the
wayside
vineyards
had
stopped
their
work
to
stare
and
had
repeated
to
each
other
rumours
of
the
fabulous
wealth
this
signor
was
said
to
possess
the
furniture
they
allowed
to
pass
without
much
controversy
but
they
shook
their
heads
dubiously
when
two
wagons
full
of
flowering
trees
and
shrubs
wound
up
the
roadway
toward
the
villa
this
foreigner
must
be
a
grasping
if
there
were
not
trees
enough
already
in
the
sabine
hills
that
he
must
bring
out
more
from
rome
the
dissection
of
the
character
of
prince
vivalanti
s
new
tenant
occupied
so
much
of
the
people
s
time
that
the
spring
pruning
of
the
vineyards
came
near
to
being
slighted
the
fountainhead
of
all
knowledge
on
the
subject
was
the
landlord
of
the
d
he
himself
had
had
the
honour
of
entertaining
their
excellencies
at
breakfast
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
visit
to
castel
vivalanti
and
with
unvarying
eloquence
he
nightly
recounted
the
story
to
an
interested
group
of
loungers
in
the
kitchen
of
how
he
had
made
the
omelet
without
garlic
because
princes
have
delicate
stomachs
and
can
not
eat
the
food
one
would
cook
for
ordinary
men
of
how
they
had
sat
at
that
very
table
and
the
young
who
was
beautiful
as
the
holy
angels
in
paradise
had
told
him
with
her
own
lips
that
it
was
the
best
omelet
she
had
ever
eaten
and
of
how
they
had
paid
fifteen
lire
for
their
breakfast
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
protest
and
then
of
their
own
accord
had
given
three
lire
more
for
eighteen
lire
di
bacco
that
was
the
kind
of
guests
he
wished
would
drop
in
every
day
but
when
domenico
paterno
the
baker
of
castel
vivalanti
heard
the
story
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
palms
and
asserted
that
a
prince
was
a
prince
all
over
the
world
and
that
the
had
allowed
himself
to
be
cheated
from
stupidity
not
generosity
for
his
part
he
thought
the
devil
was
the
same
whether
he
talked
american
or
italian
but
it
was
reported
on
the
other
hand
that
bianca
rosini
had
also
talked
with
the
when
she
was
washing
clothes
in
the
stream
they
had
stopped
their
horses
to
watch
the
work
and
the
signorina
had
smiled
and
asked
if
the
water
were
not
cold
for
her
part
she
was
sure
american
nobles
had
kind
hearts
domenico
however
was
not
to
be
convinced
by
any
such
as
this
smiles
are
cheap
he
returned
sceptically
does
any
one
know
of
their
giving
money
no
one
did
know
of
their
giving
money
but
there
were
plenty
of
boys
to
testify
that
they
had
run
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
fully
a
kilometre
asking
for
soldi
and
the
signore
had
only
shaken
his
head
to
pay
them
for
their
trouble
what
did
i
tell
you
domenico
finished
in
triumph
american
princes
are
like
any
a
little
more
stupid
but
for
the
rest
exactly
the
there
were
no
facts
at
hand
to
confute
such
logic
and
one
night
domenico
appeared
at
the
d
with
a
fresh
piece
of
news
his
son
tarquinio
who
kept
an
osteria
in
rome
had
told
the
whole
story
his
name
is
edoardo
it
is
because
of
him
that
i
pay
for
my
flour
twice
the
usual
price
when
the
harvests
failed
last
year
and
he
saw
that
wheat
was
going
to
be
scarce
he
sent
to
america
and
he
bought
all
the
wheat
in
the
land
and
he
put
it
in
storehouses
he
is
holding
it
there
now
while
the
price
goes
and
when
the
poor
people
in
italy
get
very
very
hungry
and
are
ready
to
pay
whatever
he
asks
then
will
agree
to
sell
that
is
the
truth
he
insisted
darkly
everybody
knows
it
in
rome
doubtless
he
thinks
to
escape
from
his
sin
up
here
in
the
he
will
will
follow
him
wherever
he
goes
it
is
the
story
of
the
bad
prince
over
finally
one
friday
of
the
children
of
the
village
who
were
in
the
habit
of
loitering
on
the
highway
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
stray
soldi
reported
that
the
american
s
horses
and
carriages
had
come
out
from
rome
and
that
the
drivers
had
stopped
at
the
inn
of
and
ordered
wine
like
gentlemen
it
was
further
rumoured
that
the
himself
intended
to
follow
in
the
afternoon
the
matter
was
discussed
with
considerable
interest
before
the
usual
noonday
siesta
it
is
my
opinion
said
tommaso
ferri
the
blacksmith
as
he
sat
in
the
baker
s
doorway
washing
down
alternate
mouthfuls
of
bread
and
onion
with
vivalanti
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
signor
americano
must
be
a
very
reckless
man
to
venture
on
so
important
a
journey
on
particularly
in
lent
it
is
well
known
that
if
a
poor
man
starts
for
market
on
friday
he
will
break
his
eggs
on
the
way
and
because
a
rich
man
has
no
eggs
to
break
is
that
any
reason
the
should
overlook
his
sin
things
are
more
just
in
heaven
than
on
earth
he
added
solemnly
and
in
my
opinion
if
the
foreigner
comes
he
will
not
prosper
in
the
domenico
nodded
approvingly
tommaso
is
right
the
americano
has
already
tempted
heaven
far
enough
in
this
matter
of
the
wheat
and
it
will
not
be
the
part
of
wisdom
for
him
to
add
to
the
account
apoplexies
are
as
likely
to
fall
on
princes
as
on
bakers
and
a
dead
prince
is
no
different
from
any
other
dead
that
he
goes
to
it
was
evident
however
that
the
foreigner
was
in
truth
going
to
tempt
fate
for
in
the
afternoon
two
empty
carriages
came
back
from
the
villa
and
turned
toward
palestrina
obviously
bound
for
the
station
all
the
of
castel
vivalanti
waited
on
the
road
to
see
them
pass
and
beg
for
coppers
and
it
was
just
as
domenico
had
foretold
they
never
received
a
single
soldo
the
remarks
about
the
were
not
complimentary
in
castel
vivalanti
that
night
but
the
little
was
handled
more
gently
the
little
italian
boys
told
how
he
had
laughed
when
they
turned
somersaults
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
how
he
had
cried
when
his
father
would
not
let
him
throw
soldi
and
the
general
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
if
he
died
young
he
at
least
had
a
chance
of
paradise
chapter
v
meanwhile
the
unconscious
subjects
of
castel
vivalanti
s
apoplexies
were
gaily
installing
themselves
in
their
new
old
dwelling
the
happy
hum
of
life
had
again
invaded
the
house
and
its
walls
once
more
echoed
to
the
ring
of
a
child
s
laughter
they
were
very
americans
and
they
took
possession
of
the
ancestral
home
of
the
vivalanti
as
if
it
were
as
much
their
right
as
a
seaside
cottage
at
newport
upstairs
granton
and
marietta
were
unpacking
trunks
and
hampers
and
laying
paris
gowns
in
antique
roman
in
the
villa
kitchen
françois
was
rattling
copper
pots
and
kettles
and
anxiously
trying
to
adapt
his
modern
french
ideas
to
a
mediaeval
roman
stove
while
from
every
room
in
succession
sounded
the
patter
of
gerald
s

and
his
delighted
squeals
over
each
new
discovery
for
the
past
two
weeks
roman
workmen
and
castel
vivalanti
had
been
busily
carrying
out
copley
s
orders
the
florid
furniture
and
coloured
chandeliers
of
the
latter
vivalanti
had
been
banished
to
the
attic
or
what
answers
to
an
attic
in
a
roman
villa
while
the
faded
damask
of
a
former
generation
had
been
dusted
and
restored
tapestries
covered
the
walls
and
hung
over
the
balustrade
of
the
marble
staircase
dark
rugs
lay
on
the
red
tile
floors
carved
chests
and
antique
chairs
and
tables
of
coloured
marble
supported
by
gilded
griffins
were
scattered
through
the
rooms
in
the
bedrooms
the
heavy
draperies
had
been
superseded
by
curtains
of
an
airier
texture
while
wicker
chairs
and
couches
lent
an
air
of
comfort
to
the
rooms
in
spite
of
his
humorous
grumbling
about
the
trials
of
copley
found
himself
very
comfortable
as
he
lounged
on
the
parapet
toward
sunset
smoking
a
cigarette
and
watching
the
shadows
as
they
fell
over
the
campagna
gerald
was
already
up
to
his
elbows
in
the
fountain
and
the
ilex
grove
was
echoing
his
happy
shrieks
as
he
prattled
in
italian
to
marietta
about
a
marvellous
lizard
he
had
caught
in
a
cranny
of
the
stones
copley
smiled
as
he
listened
vivalanti
to
the
little
boy
was
very
near
his
heart
marcia
in
the
house
had
been
gaily
superintending
the
unpacking
and
running
back
and
forth
between
the
rooms
as
excited
by
her
new
surroundings
as
gerald
himself
what
time
does
villa
vivalanti
dine
she
inquired
while
on
a
flying
visit
to
her
aunt
s
room
eight
o
clock
when
any
of
us
are
in
town
and
seven
other
i
suppose
it
s
seven
shall
i
make
a
in
honour
of
the
occasion
put
on
something
warm
whatever
else
you
do
i
distrust
this
climate
after
you
re
such
a
distrustful
person
aunt
katherine
i
can
t
understand
how
one
can
have
the
heart
to
accuse
this
innocent
old
villa
of
harbouring
she
returned
to
her
own
room
and
delightedly
rummaged
out
a
from
the
ancient
wardrobe
with
a
little
laugh
at
the
thought
of
the
many
different
styles
it
had
held
in
its
day
perhaps
some
other
girl
had
once
occupied
this
room
very
likely
a
young
princess
vivalanti
two
hundred
years
before
had
hung
gowns
in
this
very
wardrobe
it
was
a
big
rather
bare
delightfully
italian
apartment
with
tall
windows
having
solid
barred
shutters
overlooking
the
terrace
the
view
from
the
windows
revealed
a
broad
expanse
of
campagna
and
hills
marcia
dressed
with
her
eyes
on
the
landscape
and
then
stood
a
long
time
gazing
up
at
the
broken
ridges
of
the
sabines
glowing
softly
in
the
afternoon
light
picturesque
little
mountain
hamlets
of
battered
grey
stone
were
visible
here
and
there
clinging
to
the
heights
and
in
the
distance
the
walls
and
towers
of
a
monastery
stood
out
clear
against
the
sky
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
pleasure
to
be
an
artist
and
to
appreciate
and
reproduce
this
beauty
suddenly
struck
her
as
an
ideal
life
she
smiled
at
herself
as
she
recalled
something
she
had
said
to
paul
dessart
in
the
gallery
the
day
before
she
had
advised
exchange
italy
for
pittsburg
copley
who
was
strolling
on
the
terrace
glanced
up
and
catching
sight
of
his
niece
paused
beneath
her
balcony
while
he
quoted
but
soft
what
light
through
yonder
window
breaks
it
is
the
east
and
juliet
is
the
marcia
brought
her
eyes
from
the
distant
landscape
to
a
contemplation
of
her
uncle
and
then
she
stepped
through
the
glass
doors
and
leaned
over
the
balcony
railing
with
a
little
laugh
you
make
a
pretty
poor
romeo
uncle
howard
she
called
down
i
m
afraid
the
real
one
never
wore
a
nor
smoked
a
copley
spread
out
his
hands
in
protest
for
the
matter
of
that
i
doubt
if
juliet
ever
wore
a
gown
was
avenue
de
l
opéra
how
does
the
new
house
go
he
asked
beautifully
i
feel
like
a
princess
on
a
balcony
waiting
for
the
hunters
to
come
back
from
the
i
can
t
get
over
the
idea
that
i
m
a
usurper
myself
and
that
the
rightful
lord
is
languishing
in
a
donjon
somewhere
in
the
cellar
come
down
and
talk
to
me
i
m
getting
lonely
so
far
from
the
marcia
disappeared
from
the
balcony
and
reappeared
three
minutes
later
on
the
loggia
she
paused
on
the
top
step
and
slowly
turned
around
in
order
to
take
in
the
whole
affect
the
loggia
in
its
rehabilitation
made
an
excellent
for
a
lazy
summer
morning
it
was
furnished
with
comfortably
deep
oriental
rush
chairs
a
crimson
rug
and
awnings
and
at
either
side
of
the
steps
white
azaleas
growing
in
marble
cinerary
urns
isn
t
this
the
most
fun
you
ever
had
uncle
howard
she
inquired
as
she
brought
her
eyes
back
to
copley
waiting
on
the
terrace
below
we
ll
have
coffee
served
out
here
in
the
morning
and
then
when
it
gets
sunny
in
the
afternoon
we
ll
move
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
under
the
ilex
trees
villa
vivalanti
is
the
most
thoroughly
satisfying
place
i
ever
lived
she
ran
down
the
steps
and
joined
him
aren
t
those
little
trees
nice
she
asked
nodding
toward
a
row
of
oleanders
ranged
at
mathematical
intervals
along
the
balustrade
i
think
that
aunt
katherine
and
i
planned
things
beautifully
if
every
one
were
as
well
pleased
with
his
own
work
as
you
appear
to
be
this
would
be
a
contented
world
there
s
nothing
like
the
beautiful
enthusiasm
of
it
s
a
very
good
thing
to
have
just
the
same
said
marcia
and
without
mentioning
any
names
i
know
one
man
who
would
be
less
disagreeable
if
he
had
more
of
none
of
that
said
her
uncle
our
pact
was
that
if
i
stopped
grumbling
about
the
villa
being
so
abominably
far
from
rome
you
were
not
to
utter
unpleasant
truths
about
sybert
very
well
i
ll
not
mention
him
again
and
you
ll
please
not
refer
to
the
s
a
bargain
gerald
i
judge
has
found
the
fountain
she
added
as
a
delighted
shriek
issued
from
the
grove
and
a
menagerie
as
if
he
will
only
keep
them
out
of
doors
i
shall
dream
of
finding
lizards
in
my
if
you
only
dream
of
them
you
will
be
doing
well
i
dare
say
the
place
is
full
of
bats
and
lizards
and
owls
and
all
manner
of
you
re
such
a
pessimist
uncle
howard
between
you
and
aunt
katherine
the
poor
villa
won
t
have
a
shred
of
character
left
for
my
part
i
approve
of
it
the
ruins
i
am
dying
to
explore
you
think
it
s
too
late
far
too
late
you
d
get
malaria
to
say
nothing
of
missing
dinner
here
comes
pietro
now
to
announce
the
as
the
family
entered
the
they
involuntarily
paused
on
the
threshold
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
new
and
the
old
in
the
days
of
cardinal
vivalanti
the
room
had
been
the
chapel
and
it
still
contained
its
gothic
ceiling
appropriately
redecorated
to
its
new
uses
with
trellises
and
in
the
central
panelling
bacchus
crowned
with
vines
the
very
modern
with
its
glass
and
silver
and
shaded
candles
looked
ludicrously
out
of
place
in
the
long
dusky
vaulted
apartment
which
in
spite
of
its
rakish
frescoes
tenaciously
preserved
the
air
of
a
chapel
the
glass
doors
at
the
end
were
thrown
wide
to
a
little
balcony
which
overlooked
the
garden
and
the
ilex
grove
and
the
room
was
flooded
with
a
nightingale
s
song
marcia
clasped
her
hands
ecstatically
isn
t
this
perfect
aren
t
you
glad
we
came
aunt
katherine
i
feel
like
forgiving
all
my
enemies
uncle
howard
i
m
going
to
be
lovely
to
don
t
promise
anything
rash
he
laughed
you
ll
get
acclimated
in
a
day
or
gerald
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
because
marietta
under
the
stress
of
excitement
had
forgotten
to
give
him
his
supper
was
allowed
to
dine
elated
by
the
unwonted
privilege
and
by
his
new
surroundings
he
babbled
gaily
of
the
ride
in
the
cars
and
the
little
boys
who
turned
summelsorts
by
the
roadside
and
of
the
beautiful
lizard
of
the
fountain
whose
charms
he
dwelt
on
lovingly
but
he
had
missed
his
noonday
nap
and
though
he
struggled
bravely
through
the
first
three
courses
his
head
nodded
over
the
chicken
and
salad
and
he
was
led
away
by
marietta
still
sleepily
boasting
in
a
blend
of
english
and
italian
of
the
he
would
catch
morning
in
the
fountain
it
is
a
pity
said
marcia
as
the
sound
of
his
prattle
died
away
gerald
hasn
t
some
one
his
own
age
to
play
yes
it
is
a
pity
copley
returned
i
passed
a
lonely
childhood
myself
and
i
know
how
barren
it
that
is
the
chief
reason
that
would
make
me
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
said
his
wife
her
husband
smiled
i
suppose
there
are
children
to
be
found
outside
of
new
york
there
are
the
kirkups
in
rome
she
agreed
but
they
are
so
boisterous
and
they
always
quarrel
with
gerald
whenever
they
come
to
play
with
i
am
not
sure
myself
but
that
gerald
quarrels
with
them
returned
her
husband
however
fond
he
might
be
of
his
offspring
he
cherished
no
motherly
delusions
but
perhaps
you
are
right
he
added
with
something
of
a
sigh
it
may
be
necessary
to
take
him
back
to
america
before
long
i
myself
have
doubts
if
this
cosmopolitan
atmosphere
it
the
best
in
which
to
bring
up
a
i
should
have
wished
him
to
spend
a
winter
in
paris
for
his
french
said
copley
plaintively
but
i
dare
say
he
can
learn
it
later
marcia
didn
t
begin
till
she
was
twelve
and
she
has
a
very
good
accent
i
am
copley
twisted
the
handle
of
his
glass
in
silence
i
suppose
after
all
he
said
finally
to
no
one
in
particular
if
you
manage
to
bring
up
a
boy
to
be
a
decent
citizen
you
ve
done
something
in
the
i
don
t
know
marcia
objected
with
a
if
one
man
whom
we
will
suppose
is
a
decent
citizen
brings
up
one
boy
to
be
a
decent
citizen
and
does
nothing
else
i
don
t
see
that
much
is
gained
to
the
world
your
one
man
has
merely
shifted
the
copley
shrugged
a
trifle
perhaps
the
boy
might
be
better
able
to
bear
of
course
it
would
be
easier
for
the
man
to
think
so
she
agreed
but
if
everybody
passed
on
his
responsibilities
there
wouldn
t
be
much
progress
the
boys
might
do
the
same
you
know
when
they
grew
copley
rose
if
you
two
are
going
to
talk
metaphysics
i
shall
go
into
the
salon
and
have
coffee
it
s
not
metaphysics
it
s
theology
her
husband
returned
marcia
is
developing
into
a
terrible
i
know
it
marcia
acknowledged
i
m
growing
deplorably
moral
i
think
it
must
be
the
roman
it
doesn
t
affect
most
people
that
way
her
uncle
laughed
i
don
t
care
for
any
coffee
katherine
i
will
smoke
a
cigarette
on
the
terrace
and
wait
for
you
out
he
disappeared
through
the
balcony
doors
and
marcia
and
her
aunt
proceeded
to
the
salon
marcia
poured
the
coffee
and
her
aunt
said
as
she
received
her
cup
i
really
believe
your
uncle
is
getting
tired
of
rome
and
will
be
ready
to
go
back
before
i
don
t
believe
he
s
tired
of
rome
aunt
katherine
i
think
he
s
just
a
little
nonsense
child
he
has
nothing
to
be
discouraged
about
he
is
simply
getting
restless
again
i
know
the
signs
i
ve
never
known
him
to
stay
as
long
as
this
in
one
place
before
i
only
hope
now
that
he
will
not
think
of
any
ridiculous
new
thing
to
do
but
will
be
satisfied
to
go
back
to
new
york
and
settle
down
quietly
like
other
it
seems
to
me
said
marcia
slowly
as
if
he
might
do
more
good
there
because
he
would
understand
better
what
the
people
need
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
be
done
even
in
new
oh
yes
when
he
once
got
settled
he
would
find
any
amount
of
things
to
take
up
his
time
he
might
even
try
yachting
for
a
change
i
am
sure
that
keeps
men
marcia
sipped
her
coffee
in
silence
and
glanced
out
of
the
window
at
her
uncle
who
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
looked
a
rather
lonely
figure
in
the
it
suddenly
struck
her
as
she
watched
him
that
she
did
not
understand
him
she
had
scarcely
realized
before
that
there
was
anything
to
understand
copley
set
her
cup
down
on
the
table
and
marcia
rose
let
s
go
out
on
the
terrace
aunt
you
go
out
my
dear
and
i
will
join
you
later
i
want
to
see
if
gerald
is
asleep
i
neglected
to
have
a
crib
sent
out
for
him
and
the
dear
child
thrashes
around
with
a
bed
four
feet
high
and
a
stone
it
would
be
disastrous
marcia
agreed
she
crossed
the
loggia
to
the
terrace
and
silently
fell
into
step
beside
her
uncle
it
was
almost
dark
and
a
crescent
moon
was
hanging
low
over
the
top
of
guadagnolo
a
faint
lemon
light
still
tinged
the
west
throwing
into
misty
relief
the
outline
of
the
alban
hills
the
ilex
grove
was
the
happy
song
of
the
nightingales
and
the
splashing
of
the
fountain
sounded
uncanny
coming
from
the
darkness
but
the
white
irregular
mass
of
the
villa
formed
a
cheerful
contrast
with
its
shining
lights
which
threw
squares
of
brightness
on
the
marble
terrace
and
the
trees
marcia
looked
about
with
a
deep
breath
it
s
beautiful
isn
t
it
uncle
howard
they
paused
a
moment
by
the
parapet
and
stood
looking
down
over
the
plain
isn
t
the
campagna
lovely
she
added
half
covered
with
mist
yes
it
s
the
mist
means
death
to
the
peasants
who
live
beneath
she
exclaimed
half
impatiently
uncle
howard
can
t
you
let
anything
be
beautiful
here
without
spoiling
it
by
pointing
out
an
ugliness
beneath
i
m
sorry
it
isn
t
my
fault
that
the
ugliness
exists
look
upon
the
mist
as
a
blessed
dew
from
heaven
if
it
makes
you
any
of
course
i
should
rather
know
the
truth
but
it
seems
as
if
the
italians
are
happy
in
spite
of
things
they
strike
me
as
the
happiest
people
i
have
ever
ah
well
perhaps
they
are
happier
than
we
i
m
sure
they
are
said
marcia
comfortably
particularly
new
englanders
and
most
particularly
howard
copley
worry
too
it
s
at
least
a
fault
the
italians
haven
t
learned
he
replied
but
after
all
as
you
say
it
may
be
the
better
fortune
to
have
less
and
worry
d
like
to
believe
chapter
vi
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
marcia
had
risen
early
and
set
out
on
horseback
to
explore
the
neighbourhood
as
castel
vivalanti
accordingly
was
engaged
in
its
usual
sweeping
a
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
suddenly
sounded
on
the
tiny
corso
the
paving
is
so
villainous
that
a
single
horse
however
daintily
it
may
step
sounds
like
a
cavalcade
and
running
to
the
door
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
beheld
the
new
gaily
riding
up
the
narrow
way
and
smiling
to
the
right
and
left
for
all
the
world
like
the
queen
herself
the
women
contented
themselves
with
standing
in
the
doorways
and
staring
but
the
children
ran
boldly
after
until
the
signorina
presently
dismounted
and
bidding
the
groom
hold
her
horse
sat
down
upon
a
and
talked
to
them
with
as
much
friendliness
as
though
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
she
ended
by
asking
them
what
in
the
world
they
liked
best
to
eat
and
they
declared
in
a
single
voice
for
accordingly
they
moved
in
a
body
to
the
baker
s
and
to
domenico
s
astonishment
ordered
all
of
the
chocolate
in
the
shop
and
while
he
was
excitedly
counting
it
out
the
signorina
kept
talking
to
him
about
the
weather
and
the
scenery
and
the
olive
crop
until
he
was
so
overcome
by
the
honour
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
bob
his
head
and
murmur
si
eccelenza
si
si
to
everything
she
said
and
as
soon
as
she
had
mounted
her
horse
again
and
ridden
away
with
a
final
wave
of
her
hand
to
the
little
children
domenico
hurried
to
the
d
to
inform
the
landlord
that
he
also
had
had
the
honour
of
entertaining
the
who
had
bought
chocolate
to
the
amount
of
five
lire
and
had
given
it
all
away
the
blacksmith
s
wife
who
had
followed
domenico
to
hear
the
news
remarked
that
for
her
part
she
thought
it
a
sin
to
spend
so
much
for
chocolate
the
signorina
might
have
given
the
money
just
as
well
and
they
could
have
had
meat
for
sunday
but
domenico
was
more
ready
this
time
to
condone
the
fault
he
returned
with
a
nod
of
his
head
the
signorina
meant
well
no
doubt
but
she
could
not
understand
the
needs
of
poor
people
he
supposed
that
they
lived
on
chocolate
all
the
time
at
the
villa
and
naturally
did
not
realize
that
persons
who
worked
for
their
living
found
meat
more
nourishing
when
marcia
returned
home
with
the
announcement
that
she
had
visited
castel
vivalanti
her
uncle
replied
with
an
elaborate
frown
i
suppose
you
scattered
soldi
broadcast
through
the
streets
and
have
started
fifty
young
italians
on
the
broad
road
to
pauperism
not
a
single
soldo
she
reassured
him
i
distributed
nothing
more
demoralizing
than
a
few
cakes
of
you
ll
make
a
scientific
philanthropist
if
you
keep
on
copley
laughed
but
his
inner
reflections
coincided
somewhat
with
those
of
the
blacksmith
s
wife
marcia
s
explorations
were
likewise
extended
in
other
directions
and
before
the
first
week
was
over
she
had
visited
most
of
the
villages
from
palestrina
to
subiaco
as
a
result
the
chief
article
of
diet
in
the
sabine
mountains
bade
fair
to
become
sweet
chocolate
while
domenico
the
baker
instead
of
being
grateful
for
this
unexpected
flow
of
custom
complained
to
his
friends
of
the
trouble
it
caused
no
sooner
would
he
send
into
rome
for
a
fresh
supply
than
the
signorina
would
come
and
carry
the
whole
of
it
off
at
that
rate
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
keep
it
in
stock
by
means
of
largesses
of
chocolate
to
the
children
or
possibly
by
a
smile
and
a
friendly
air
marcia
had
established
in
a
very
short
time
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
on
sunny
mornings
as
she
rode
between
the
olive
orchards
and
the
wheat
fields
more
than
one
worker
straightened
his
back
to
call
a
pleased
signorina
to
the
stranger
princess
who
came
from
the
land
across
the
water
where
it
was
rumoured
gold
could
be
dug
from
the
ground
like
potatoes
and
every
one
was
rich
all
about
that
region
the
advent
of
the
foreigners
was
the
subject
of
chief
because
they
were
americani
for
many
of
the
people
were
thinking
of
becoming
americani
themselves
the
servants
of
the
villa
when
they
condescended
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
at
the
inn
of
the
d
were
almost
objects
of
veneration
because
they
could
talk
so
intimately
of
the
life
these
stranger
princes
stranger
princes
would
have
been
astonished
could
they
have
heard
some
of
the
details
of
these
recitals
and
so
the
copley
dynasty
began
at
castel
vivalanti
the
life
soon
fell
into
a
daily
routine
as
life
in
even
the
best
of
places
will
three
meals
and
tea
a
book
in
the
shadiness
of
the
ilex
grove
to
the
tune
of
the
splashing
fountain
a
siesta
at
noon
a
drive
in
the
afternoon
and
a
long
night
s
sleep
were
the
sum
of
vivalanti
s
resources
marcia
liked
it
italy
had
got
its
hold
upon
her
and
for
the
present
she
was
content
to
drift
but
copley
after
a
few
days
of
lounging
on
the
balustrade
smoking
countless
cigarettes
and
hungrily
reading
such
newspapers
as
drifted
out
on
the
somewhat
casual
mails
had
his
horse
saddled
one
morning
and
rode
to
palestrina
to
the
station
after
that
he
went
into
rome
almost
every
day
and
the
peasants
in
the
wayside
vineyards
came
to
know
him
as
well
as
his
niece
but
they
did
not
take
off
their
hats
and
smile
as
they
did
to
her
for
he
rode
past
with
unseeing
eyes
rich
men
they
said
had
no
thought
for
such
as
they
and
they
turned
back
to
their
work
with
a
sullen
scowl
work
at
the
best
is
hard
enough
and
it
is
a
pity
when
the
smile
that
makes
it
lighter
is
withheld
howard
copley
would
have
been
the
last
to
do
it
had
he
realized
but
his
thoughts
were
bent
on
other
things
and
how
could
the
peasants
know
that
while
he
galloped
by
so
carelessly
his
mind
was
planning
a
way
to
get
them
bread
marcia
spent
many
the
first
few
weeks
in
loitering
about
the
ruins
of
the
old
villa
it
was
a
spot
which
spoke
pathetically
of
a
bygone
time
with
bygone
ideals
she
could
never
quite
reconcile
the
crumbling
arches
the
fantastic
and
the
terraces
with
the
young
italy
of
monte
citorio
thirty
miles
away
to
eyes
fresh
from
the
new
world
it
seemed
half
unreal
one
afternoon
she
had
started
to
walk
across
the
fields
to
castel
vivalanti
but
the
fields
had
proved
too
sunny
and
she
had
stopped
in
the
shade
of
the
cypresses
instead
even
the
ruins
seemed
to
be
revivified
by
the
warm
touch
of
spring
blue
and
white
anemones
cyclamen
yellow
laburnum
burst
from
every
cranny
of
the
stones
marcia
glanced
about
with
an
air
of
delighted
approval
a
pan
with
his
pipes
was
all
that
was
needed
to
make
the
picture
complete
she
dropped
down
on
the
coping
of
the
fountain
and
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
gazed
dreamily
at
the
merman
who
two
centuries
before
had
spouted
water
from
his
twisted
she
was
suddenly
startled
from
her
reverie
by
hearing
a
voice
exclaim
signorina
and
she
looked
up
quickly
to
find
paul
dessart
mr
dessart
she
cried
in
amazement
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
the
inn
of
at
palestrina
benoit
and
i
are
making
it
the
centre
of
a
sketching
expedition
we
get
a
sort
of
hill
fever
every
spring
and
when
the
disease
reaches
a
certain
point
we
pack
up
and
set
out
for
the
and
how
did
you
manage
to
find
us
purely
chance
he
returned
more
or
less
truthfully
i
picked
out
this
road
as
a
promising
field
and
when
i
came
to
the
gateway
being
an
artist
i
couldn
t
resist
the
temptation
of
coming
in
i
didn
t
know
that
it
was
villa
vivalanti
or
that
i
should
find
you
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
fountain
and
looked
about
well
marcia
inquired
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
wanted
to
exchange
rome
for
this
may
i
make
a
little
sketch
and
will
you
stay
and
talk
to
me
until
it
is
finished
that
depends
upon
how
long
it
takes
you
to
make
a
little
sketch
i
shall
subscribe
to
no
he
got
out
a
box
of
from
one
pocket
of
his
norfolk
jacket
and
a
large
pad
from
the
other
and
having
filled
his
cup
at
the
little
stream
which
once
had
fed
the
fountain
set
to
work
without
more
ado
i
heard
from
the
roystons
this
morning
said
marcia
presently
and
immediately
she
was
sorry
that
she
had
not
started
some
other
subject
in
their
former
conversations
paul
s
relations
with
his
family
had
never
proved
a
very
fortunate
topic
any
bad
news
he
inquired
flippantly
they
will
reach
rome
in
a
week
or
holy
might
have
known
it
miss
copley
he
looked
at
her
appealingly
you
know
what
an
indefatigable
woman
my
aunt
is
she
will
make
me
escort
her
to
every
religious
function
that
blessed
city
offers
it
isn
t
her
way
to
miss
marcia
smiled
slightly
at
the
picture
it
was
lifelike
i
shall
be
stopping
in
palestrina
when
they
come
he
added
she
let
this
observation
pass
in
a
disapproving
silence
oh
well
he
sighed
i
ll
stay
and
tote
them
around
if
you
think
i
ought
the
bible
says
you
know
love
your
relatives
and
show
mercy
unto
them
that
despitefully
use
marcia
flashed
a
sudden
laugh
and
then
looked
grave
paul
glanced
up
at
her
quickly
i
suppose
my
aunt
told
you
no
end
of
bad
things
about
me
was
there
anything
to
tell
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
ve
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
of
preferring
art
in
rome
to
coal
in
he
dropped
the
subject
and
turned
back
to
his
picture
and
marcia
sat
watching
him
as
he
industriously
splashed
in
colour
occasionally
their
eyes
met
when
he
raised
his
head
and
if
his
own
lingered
a
moment
longer
than
convention
an
artist
he
was
excusable
for
she
was
distinctly
an
addition
to
the
fountain
the
young
man
may
have
prolonged
the
situation
somewhat
in
any
case
the
sun
s
rays
were
beginning
to
slant
when
he
finally
pocketed
his
colours
and
presented
the
picture
with
a
bow
it
was
a
dainty
little
sketch
of
a
ruined
grotto
and
a
broken
statue
with
the
sunlight
flickering
through
the
trees
on
the
grass
really
is
it
for
me
she
asked
it
s
lovely
dessart
and
when
i
go
away
from
rome
i
can
remember
both
you
and
the
villa
by
when
you
go
away
he
asked
with
an
audible
note
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
but
i
thought
you
had
come
to
live
with
your
oh
for
the
present
she
returned
but
i
m
going
back
to
america
in
the
indefinite
he
breathed
an
exaggerated
sigh
of
relief
the
indefinite
future
doesn
t
bother
me
before
it
comes
you
ll
change
your
does
it
s
merely
the
present
i
want
to
be
sure
marcia
glanced
at
him
a
moment
with
a
laugh
and
then
without
responding
she
turned
her
head
and
appeared
to
study
the
stone
village
up
on
the
height
she
was
quite
conscious
that
he
was
watching
her
and
she
was
equally
conscious
that
her
muslin
gown
and
her
rosebud
hat
formed
an
admirable
contrast
to
the
frowning
old
merman
when
she
turned
back
there
was
a
shade
of
amusement
in
her
glance
paul
did
not
speak
but
he
did
not
lower
his
eyes
nor
in
any
degree
veil
his
visible
admiration
she
rose
with
a
and
brushed
back
a
stray
lock
of
hair
that
was
blowing
in
her
eyes
i
m
hungry
she
remarked
in
an
exasperatingly
tone
let
s
go
back
and
get
some
will
copley
receive
a
jacket
and
knickerbockers
mrs
copley
will
be
delighted
visitors
are
a
godsend
at
villa
they
passed
from
the
deep
shade
of
the
cypresses
to
the
laurel
path
that
skirted
the
wheat
field
as
they
strolled
along
in
no
great
hurry
to
reach
the
villa
they
laughed
and
chatted
lightly
but
the
most
important
things
they
said
occurred
in
the
pauses
when
no
words
were
spoken
the
young
man
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
carelessly
switching
the
branches
with
it
as
he
passed
his
shining
the
colour
of
marcia
s
on
his
forehead
in
a
tangled
mass
and
stirred
gently
in
the
wind
she
noted
it
in
an
approving
sidewise
glance
and
quickly
turned
away
again
lest
he
should
look
up
and
catch
her
eyes
upon
him
in
the
ilex
grove
they
paused
for
a
moment
as
the
sound
of
mingled
voices
reached
them
from
the
terrace
listen
marcia
whispered
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
as
she
recognized
the
tones
she
made
a
slight
grimace
my
two
enemies
the
contessa
torrenieri
and
sybert
the
contessa
has
a
villa
at
tivoli
this
is
very
kind
of
her
is
it
not
nine
miles
is
a
long
distance
just
to
pay
a
as
they
advanced
toward
the
placed
under
the
trees
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
they
found
an
unexpectedly
august
only
the
contessa
torrenieri
and
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
but
the
american
as
well
the
men
had
evidently
but
just
arrived
as
copley
was
still
engaged
with
their
welcome
mr
melville
you
come
at
exactly
the
right
time
we
are
having
mushroom
ragoût
which
if
i
remember
is
your
favourite
why
didn
t
you
bring
your
wife
my
wife
my
dear
lady
is
at
present
in
capri
and
shows
no
intention
of
coming
home
your
husband
pitying
my
loneliness
insisted
on
bringing
me
out
for
the
i
am
glad
that
he
shall
hope
to
see
you
later
however
when
melville
can
come
too
sybert
she
added
turning
toward
the
younger
man
you
can
t
know
how
we
miss
not
having
you
drop
in
at
all
hours
of
the
day
we
didn
t
realize
what
a
necessary
member
of
the
family
you
had
become
until
we
had
to
do
without
marcia
overhearing
this
speech
politely
suppressed
a
smile
as
she
presented
the
young
painter
he
was
included
in
the
general
acclaim
this
is
charming
copley
declared
i
was
just
complaining
to
the
contessa
torrenieri
that
not
a
soul
had
visited
us
since
we
came
out
to
the
villa
and
here
are
three
almost
before
the
words
are
out
of
my
mouth
pietro
appearing
with
a
trayful
of
cups
put
an
end
to
these
amenities
and
reinforced
by
gerald
they
had
an
unusually
festive
copley
had
once
remarked
concerning
paul
dessart
that
he
would
be
an
ornament
to
any
and
he
undoubtedly
proved
himself
an
ornament
melville
introducing
the
subject
of
a
famous
monastery
lately
suppressed
by
the
government
gave
rise
to
a
discussion
involving
many
and
various
opinions
the
contessa
and
dessart
hotly
defended
the
homeless
monks
while
the
other
men
from
a
political
point
of
view
were
inclined
to
applaud
the
action
of
the
premier
their
arguments
were
strong
but
the
little
contessa
two
slender
hands
gesticulating
excitedly
stanchly
held
her
own
though
a
white
in
politics
her
sympathies
on
occasion
stuck
persistently
to
the
other
side
the
church
had
owned
the
property
for
five
centuries
the
government
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
which
had
the
better
right
and
aside
from
the
justice
of
the
backed
her
ascetic
reasons
alone
the
monks
should
be
allowed
to
stay
who
wished
to
have
the
beauties
of
frescoed
chapels
and
carved
pointed
out
by
government
officials
whose
coats
didn
t
fit
it
spoiled
the
poetry
names
of
cardinals
and
prelates
and
italian
princes
passed
glibly
and
the
politicians
finally
retired
beaten
marcia
listening
thought
approvingly
that
the
young
artist
was
a
match
for
the
diplomats
and
she
could
not
help
but
acknowledge
further
that
whatever
faults
the
contessa
might
possess
dullness
was
not
among
them
it
was
gerald
however
who
furnished
the
chief
diversion
that
afternoon
upon
being
forbidden
to
take
a
third
he
rose
reluctantly
shook
the
crumbs
from
his
blouse
and
drifted
off
toward
the
ilex
grove
to
occupy
himself
with
the
collection
of
lizards
which
he
kept
in
a
box
under
a
stone
garden
seat
the
group
about
the
was
shortly
startled
by
a
splash
and
a
scream
and
they
hastened
with
one
accord
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
copley
arriving
first
was
in
time
to
pluck
his
son
from
the
fountain
like
achilles
by
a
heel
what
s
the
matter
howard
copley
called
as
the
others
anxiously
hurried
up
nothing
serious
he
reassured
her
gerald
has
merely
been
trying
to
identify
himself
with
his
gerald
dripping
and
sputtering
came
out
at
this
point
with
the
astounding
assertion
that
marietta
had
pushed
him
in
marietta
chimed
into
the
general
confusion
with
a
volley
of
latin
ejaculations
she
push
him
in
what
a
fib
why
should
she
do
such
a
thing
as
that
when
it
would
only
put
her
to
the
trouble
of
dressing
him
again
she
had
told
him
repeatedly
not
to
fall
into
the
fountain
but
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
he
disobeyed
amid
a
chorus
of
laughter
and
suggestions
of
wails
and
protestations
the
nurse
the
boy
and
his
father
and
mother
set
out
for
the
house
to
settle
the
question
leaving
the
guests
at
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
as
they
strolled
back
to
the
terrace
the
contessa
very
adroitly
held
sybert
on
one
side
and
dessart
on
the
other
while
with
a
great
deal
of
animation
and
gesture
she
recounted
a
diverting
bit
of
roman
gossip
melville
and
marcia
followed
after
the
latter
with
a
speculative
eye
on
the
group
in
front
and
an
amused
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
young
artist
would
very
much
have
preferred
dropping
behind
possibly
the
contessa
divined
this
too
in
any
case
she
held
him
fast
the
was
discussing
a
criticism
he
had
recently
read
of
the
american
diplomatic
service
and
his
opinion
of
the
writer
was
vigorous
melville
s
views
were
likely
to
be
both
vigorously
conceived
and
vigorously
expressed
in
any
case
he
summed
up
his
remarks
america
has
no
call
to
be
ashamed
of
her
representative
to
italy
his
excellency
is
a
fine
example
of
the
right
man
in
the
right
and
his
excellency
s
nephew
she
inquired
her
eyes
on
the
lounging
figure
in
front
of
them
is
an
equally
fine
example
of
the
right
man
in
the
wrong
i
thought
you
were
one
of
the
people
who
stood
up
for
you
thought
i
was
one
of
the
people
who
stood
up
for
him
well
certainly
why
not
melville
s
tone
contained
the
suggestion
of
a
challenge
he
had
fought
so
many
battles
in
sybert
s
behalf
that
a
belligerent
attitude
over
the
question
had
become
subconscious
oh
i
don
t
know
said
marcia
vaguely
lots
of
people
don
t
like
melville
struck
a
match
lit
a
cigar
and
vigorously
puffed
it
into
a
glow
then
he
observed
lots
of
people
are
marcia
laughed
and
excuse
me
but
you
are
all
so
funny
about
sybert
one
day
i
hear
the
most
extravagant
things
in
his
praise
and
the
next
the
most
disparaging
things
in
his
dispraise
it
s
difficult
to
know
what
to
believe
of
such
a
changeable
person
as
just
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
miss
marcia
and
that
is
that
in
this
world
a
man
who
has
no
enemies
is
not
to
be
don
t
know
how
it
may
be
in
the
world
to
come
at
for
sybert
you
may
safely
believe
what
his
friends
say
of
in
that
case
he
certainly
does
not
show
his
best
side
to
the
he
probably
thinks
his
best
side
nobody
s
business
but
his
and
then
as
a
thought
to
him
he
glanced
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
while
a
brief
smile
flickered
across
his
aggressively
forceful
face
she
could
not
interpret
the
smile
but
it
was
vaguely
irritating
and
as
he
did
not
have
anything
further
to
say
she
pursued
her
theme
when
you
see
a
person
who
doesn
t
take
any
interest
in
his
own
country
whose
only
aim
is
to
be
thought
a
cosmopolitan
a
man
of
the
world
whose
business
in
life
is
to
attend
social
functions
and
make
naturally
you
can
t
blame
people
for
not
taking
him
very
she
finished
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
you
were
telling
me
a
little
while
ago
miss
marcia
about
some
of
the
people
in
castel
vivalanti
you
appear
to
be
rather
proud
of
your
in
occasionally
being
able
to
detect
the
real
man
underneath
the
t
you
think
you
might
push
your
penetration
just
one
step
further
and
discover
a
real
man
a
personality
beneath
the
man
of
the
world
once
in
a
while
it
you
can
t
argue
me
into
liking
sybert
she
laughed
uncle
howard
has
tried
it
and
and
copley
returned
shortly
to
their
guests
and
the
contessa
bemoaning
the
nine
miles
announced
that
she
must
go
copley
suggested
that
nine
miles
would
be
no
longer
after
dinner
than
before
but
the
lady
was
obdurate
and
her
carriage
was
ordered
she
took
her
departure
amid
a
graceful
flurry
of
farewell
the
contessa
had
an
unerring
instinct
for
effect
and
her
exits
and
her
entrances
were
divertingly
spectacular
she
bade
copley
marcia
and
the
upon
the
terrace
and
trailed
across
the
marble
flagging
a
careful
distance
from
her
the
three
remaining
men
sybert
handed
her
into
the
carriage
dessart
arranged
the
while
copley
brought
up
the
rear
gingerly
bearing
her
lace
parasol
with
a
gay
little
tilt
of
her
hat
toward
the
group
on
the
terrace
and
an
flash
of
black
eyes
she
was
finally
off
followed
by
the
courtly
bows
of
her
three
cavaliers
marcia
with
sybert
and
dessart
on
either
hand
continued
to
stroll
up
and
down
the
terrace
while
her
aunt
and
uncle
entertained
melville
amid
the
furnished
comfort
of
the
loggia
sybert
would
ordinarily
have
joined
the
group
on
the
loggia
but
he
happened
to
be
in
the
middle
of
a
discussion
with
dessart
regarding
the
new
and
according
to
most
people
scandalous
proposition
for
levelling
the
seven
hills
the
two
men
seemed
to
be
diametrically
opposed
to
all
their
views
and
were
equally
far
apart
in
their
methods
of
arguing
dessart
would
lunge
into
flights
of
exaggerated
rhetoric
piling
up
adjectives
and
metaphors
until
by
sheer
weight
he
had
carried
his
listeners
off
their
feet
while
sybert
with
a
curt
phrase
would
knock
the
from
under
the
finished
edifice
the
latter
s
method
of
fencing
had
always
irritated
marcia
beyond
measure
he
had
a
fashion
of
stating
his
point
and
then
abandoning
his
adversary
s
eloquence
in
as
if
it
were
not
worth
his
while
to
argue
further
having
come
to
a
deadlock
in
the
matter
of
the
they
dropped
the
subject
and
pausing
by
the
terrace
parapet
they
stood
looking
down
on
the
plain
below
dessart
scanned
it
eagerly
with
eyes
quick
to
catch
every
contrast
and
tone
he
noted
the
varying
purples
of
the
distance
the
narrow
ribbon
of
glimmering
gold
where
sky
and
plain
met
the
sea
the
misty
whiteness
of
rome
the
sharply
cut
outline
of
monte
soracte
it
was
perfect
as
a
perspective
might
be
bettered
he
sighed
a
contented
sigh
even
i
he
murmured
couldn
t
suggest
a
single
a
slight
smile
crept
over
sybert
s
sombre
face
i
could
suggest
a
the
young
painter
brought
a
reproachful
gaze
to
bear
upon
him
ah
he
agreed
and
i
can
imagine
the
direction
they
d
take
miss
copley
he
added
turning
to
marcia
let
me
tell
you
of
the
thing
i
saw
the
other
day
on
the
roman
campagna
a
sight
which
was
enough
to
make
a
man
sick
i
there
was
a
tragic
mccormick
reaper
and
binder
sybert
uttered
a
short
laugh
i
am
glad
that
you
did
and
i
only
wish
it
were
possible
for
one
to
see
man
man
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
saying
paul
cried
there
were
tears
in
his
voice
a
mccormick
reaper
i
tell
you
painted
red
and
yellow
and
man
who
did
it
should
have
been
compelled
to
drink
his
marcia
laughed
and
he
added
disgustedly
the
thing
sows
and
reaps
and
binds
all
at
once
one
shudders
to
think
of
its
that
in
the
agra
romana
which
picturesque
peasants
have
spaded
and
planted
and
mowed
by
hand
for
thousands
of
not
however
a
particularly
economical
way
of
cultivating
the
campagna
sybert
observed
economical
way
of
cultivating
the
campagna
dessart
repeated
the
words
with
a
groan
is
there
no
place
in
the
world
sacred
to
beauty
must
america
flood
every
corner
of
the
habitable
globe
with
reapers
and
and
the
way
they
re
sophisticating
these
adorably
antique
peasants
is
that
s
the
way
it
seems
to
me
marcia
agreed
cordially
uncle
howard
says
they
haven
t
enough
to
eat
but
they
certainly
do
look
happy
and
they
don
t
look
thin
i
can
t
help
believing
he
exaggerates
the
an
italian
miss
copley
who
doesn
t
know
where
his
next
meal
is
coming
from
will
lie
on
his
back
in
the
sunshine
thinking
how
pretty
the
sky
looks
and
he
will
get
as
much
pleasure
from
the
prospect
as
he
would
from
his
dinner
if
that
isn
t
the
art
of
being
happy
i
don
t
know
what
is
and
that
is
why
i
hate
to
have
italy
well
dessart
i
fancy
we
all
hate
that
sybert
returned
though
i
am
afraid
we
should
quarrel
over
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
west
where
the
plain
joined
the
sea
by
the
ruins
of
ostia
and
the
pontine
marshes
it
was
a
great
barren
desolate
waste
unpeopled
uncultivated
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
rather
a
fine
thing
he
asked
to
see
that
land
drained
and
planted
and
lived
on
again
as
it
was
perhaps
two
thousand
years
ago
marcia
shook
her
head
i
should
rather
have
it
left
just
as
it
is
possibly
a
few
might
gain
but
think
of
the
poetry
and
picturesqueness
and
romance
that
the
many
would
lose
once
in
a
while
sybert
it
seems
as
if
utility
might
give
way
to
on
the
roman
campagna
it
is
more
fitting
that
it
should
be
desolate
and
bare
with
only
a
few
wandering
shepherds
and
herds
and
no
buildings
but
ruined
towers
and
latin
sort
of
for
ancient
the
living
have
a
few
in
they
seem
to
have
a
good
many
dessart
agreed
oh
i
know
what
you
reformers
want
you
d
like
to
see
the
city
full
of
and
machinery
and
the
campagna
laid
out
in
garden
plots
and
everybody
getting
good
wages
and
six
per
cent
interest
with
all
the
people
dressed
alike
in
clothing
instead
of
peasant
costume
and
nobody
poor
and
nobody
sybert
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
as
with
eyes
he
studied
the
distance
he
was
thinking
of
a
ride
he
had
taken
three
days
before
he
had
gone
out
with
a
to
one
of
the
great
campagna
estates
owned
by
a
roman
prince
whose
only
interest
in
the
land
was
to
draw
from
it
every
possible
of
income
they
had
stopped
to
water
their
horses
at
a
cluster
of
straw
huts
where
the
farm
labourers
lived
and
sybert
had
dismounted
and
gone
into
one
of
them
to
talk
to
the
people
it
was
dark
and
damp
with
a
dirt
floor
and
rude
bunks
along
the
sides
there
fifty
human
beings
lived
crowded
together
breathing
the
heavy
pestilential
air
they
had
come
down
to
bands
from
their
mountain
homes
searching
for
work
and
had
sold
their
lives
to
the
prince
for
thirty
cents
a
day
the
picture
flashed
across
him
now
of
their
pale
apathetic
faces
of
the
dumb
reproach
in
their
eyes
and
for
a
second
he
felt
tempted
to
describe
it
but
with
the
reflection
that
neither
of
the
two
before
him
would
care
any
more
about
it
than
had
the
landlord
prince
he
changed
his
expression
into
a
careless
shrug
it
will
be
some
time
before
we
ll
see
that
he
answered
dessart
s
speech
but
you
d
like
it
wouldn
t
you
marcia
persisted
yes
wouldn
t
you
no
she
laughed
i
can
t
say
that
i
should
i
decidedly
prefer
the
peasants
as
they
are
they
are
far
more
attractive
when
they
are
poor
and
since
they
are
happy
in
spite
of
it
i
don
t
see
why
it
is
our
place
to
sybert
eyed
the
pavement
impassively
a
moment
then
he
raised
his
head
and
turned
to
marcia
he
swept
her
a
glance
from
head
to
foot
which
took
in
every
detail
of
her
dainty
gown
her
careless
grace
as
she
leaned
against
the
balustrade
and
he
made
no
endeavour
to
conceal
the
look
of
critically
cold
contempt
in
his
eyes
marcia
returned
his
glance
with
an
air
of
angry
challenge
not
a
word
was
spoken
but
it
was
an
open
declaration
of
war
chapter
vii
the
roystons
approached
rome
by
easy
stages
along
the
riviera
and
as
their
prospective
movements
were
but
vaguely
outlined
even
to
themselves
they
suffered
their
approach
to
remain
unheralded
paul
dessart
since
his
talk
with
marcia
had
taken
a
little
dip
into
the
future
with
the
result
that
he
had
decided
to
swallow
any
hurt
feelings
he
might
possess
and
pay
dutiful
court
to
his
relatives
the
immediate
rewards
of
such
a
course
were
evident
one
sunny
morning
early
in
april
he
had
been
right
in
his
forecast
of
the
time
palm
sunday
loomed
a
week
ahead
a
carriage
drew
up
before
the
door
of
his
studio
and
royston
and
the
misses
royston
alighted
squabbled
with
the
driver
over
the
fare
and
told
him
he
need
not
wait
they
rang
the
bell
and
during
the
pause
that
followed
stood
upon
the
dubiously
scanning
the
neighbourhood
it
was
one
of
the
narrow
tortuous
streets
between
the
corso
and
the
river
a
street
of
many
colours
and
many
smells
with
washings
fluttering
from
the
windows
with
pretty
children
in
gold
and
shockingly
scanty
clothing
sprawling
underfoot
the
house
itself
presented
a
blank
face
of
peeling
stucco
to
the
street
with
nothing
but
the
heavily
barred
windows
below
and
an
ornamental
cornice
four
stories
up
to
suggest
that
it
had
once
been
a
palace
and
a
stronghold
royston
turned
from
her
inspection
of
the
street
to
ring
the
bell
again
there
was
this
time
a
suggestion
of
impatience
in
her
touch
a
second
wait
and
the
door
was
finally
opened
by
one
of
the
fantastic
little
shepherd
models
who
haunt
the
spanish
steps
he
took
off
his
hat
with
a
polite
signore
as
he
darted
up
the
stairs
ahead
of
them
to
point
the
way
and
open
the
door
at
the
top
they
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
five
flights
somewhat
short
of
breath
and
were
ushered
into
a
swept
and
garnished
workroom
where
paul
in
a
white
blouse
his
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbows
was
immersed
in
a
large
canvas
almost
too
preoccupied
to
look
up
he
received
his
relatives
with
an
air
of
delighted
surprise
stood
quite
still
while
his
aunt
implanted
a
ponderous
kiss
upon
his
cheek
and
after
a
glance
at
his
cousins
kissed
them
of
his
own
accord
royston
sat
down
and
surveyed
the
room
it
was
irreproachably
workmanlike
and
had
been
so
for
a
week
visibly
impressed
she
transferred
her
gaze
to
her
nephew
paul
you
improved
she
said
at
length
my
dear
aunt
i
am
five
years
older
than
i
was
five
years
well
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
actually
believe
you
are
paul
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
desirable
cousin
was
margaret
s
frank
comment
as
she
returned
from
an
inspection
of
the
room
to
a
reinspection
of
him
eleanor
said
you
wore
puffed
velveteen
trousers
you
don
t
do
you
never
had
a
pair
of
puffed
velveteen
trousers
in
my
oh
yes
you
did
said
eleanor
you
can
t
fib
down
the
past
that
way
mamma
and
i
met
you
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
in
broad
daylight
wearing
puffed
blue
velveteen
trousers
with
a
bottle
of
wine
in
one
pocket
and
a
loaf
of
bread
in
the
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
he
pleaded
i
go
to
an
english
tailor
on
the
corso
marcia
copley
wrote
that
she
was
very
much
pleased
with
you
but
she
didn
t
tell
us
how
you
were
said
margaret
still
frank
paul
reddened
a
trifle
as
he
repudiated
the
charge
with
a
laughing
gesture
don
t
you
think
miss
copley
s
nice
pursued
margaret
you
d
better
think
so
she
added
for
she
s
one
of
our
best
paul
reddened
still
more
as
he
replied
indifferently
that
miss
copley
appeared
very
nice
he
hadn
t
seen
much
of
her
of
course
i
hope
said
his
aunt
that
you
have
been
my
dear
aunt
he
objected
patiently
i
really
don
t
go
out
of
my
way
to
be
impolite
to
people
and
he
took
the
baedeker
from
her
hand
and
sat
down
beside
her
what
places
do
you
want
to
see
first
he
inquired
they
were
soon
deep
in
computations
of
the
galleries
ruins
and
churches
that
should
be
visited
in
conjunction
and
half
an
hour
later
paul
and
margaret
in
one
carriage
with
royston
and
eleanor
in
a
second
were
trotting
toward
the
colosseum
while
paul
was
reflecting
that
the
path
of
duty
need
not
of
necessity
be
a
thorny
one
during
the
next
week
or
so
villa
vivalanti
saw
little
more
of
marcia
than
of
her
uncle
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
time
in
rome
visiting
galleries
and
churches
with
studio
teas
and
other
lenten
relaxations
to
lighten
the
rigour
of
paul
dessart
proved
himself
an
attentive
cicerone
and
his
devotion
to
duty
was
not
unrewarded
the
dim
crypts
and
chapels
the
windows
of
galleries
and
palaces
afforded
many
chances
for
stolen
scraps
of
conversation
and
paul
was
not
one
to
waste
his
opportunities
the
spring
was
ideal
rome
was
flooded
with
sunshine
and
flowers
and
the
italian
joy
of
being
alive
the
troubles
of
italy
s
paupers
which
copley
found
so
absorbing
received
during
these
days
little
consideration
from
his
niece
marcia
was
too
busy
living
her
own
life
to
have
eyes
for
any
but
happy
people
she
looked
at
italy
through
glasses
and
italy
basking
in
the
spring
sunshine
smiled
back
sympathetically
one
morning
an
accident
happened
at
the
villa
and
though
it
may
not
seem
important
to
the
world
in
general
still
as
events
turned
out
it
proved
to
be
the
pivot
upon
which
destiny
turned
gerald
fell
over
the
parapet
landing
eight
feet
a
bleeding
nose
and
a
broken
front
tooth
he
could
not
claim
this
time
that
marietta
had
pushed
him
over
as
it
was
clearly
proven
that
marietta
at
the
moment
was
sitting
in
the
scullery
doorway
smiling
at
françois
in
consequence
marietta
received
her
wages
a
ticket
to
rome
and
fifty
lire
to
dry
her
tears
a
new
nurse
was
hastily
summoned
from
castel
vivalanti
she
was
a
niece
of
domenic
the
baker
and
had
served
in
the
household
of
prince
barberini
at
palestrina
which
was
recommendation
enough
as
to
the
broken
tooth
it
was
a
first
tooth
and
shaky
at
that
most
people
would
have
contented
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
the
matter
would
right
itself
in
the
course
of
nature
but
copley
who
perhaps
had
a
tendency
to
be
on
a
question
involving
her
son
s
health
or
beauty
decided
that
gerald
must
go
to
the
dentist
s
gerald
demurred
and
marcia
who
had
previously
had
no
thought
of
going
into
rome
that
afternoon
offered
to
accompany
the
party
for
the
keeping
up
his
courage
in
the
train
as
they
were
preparing
to
start
she
informed
copley
that
she
thought
she
would
stay
with
the
roystons
all
night
since
they
had
planned
to
visit
the
forum
by
moonlight
some
evening
and
this
appeared
a
convenient
time
in
the
roman
station
she
abandoned
gerald
to
his
fate
and
drove
to
the
de
londres
et
she
found
the
ladies
just
sitting
down
to
their
midday
breakfast
and
delighted
to
see
her
it
developed
however
that
they
had
an
unbreakable
engagement
for
the
evening
and
the
plan
of
visiting
the
forum
was
accordingly
out
of
the
question
no
matter
said
marcia
drawing
off
her
gloves
i
can
come
in
some
other
day
it
s
always
moonlight
in
rome
and
they
settled
themselves
to
discussing
plans
for
the
afternoon
the
hotel
porter
had
given
margaret
a
permesso
for
the
royal
palace
and
stables
and
being
interested
in
the
domestic
arrangements
of
kings
she
was
insistent
that
they
visit
the
quirinal
but
royston
who
was
conscientiously
bent
on
first
exhausting
the
heavier
attractions
set
forth
in
baedeker
declared
for
the
lateran
museum
the
matter
was
still
unsettled
when
they
rose
from
the
table
and
were
presented
with
the
cards
of
paul
dessart
and
adolphe
benoit
paul
s
voice
settled
the
question
the
city
was
too
full
of
pilgrims
for
any
pleasure
to
be
had
within
the
walls
why
not
take
advantage
of
the
pleasant
weather
to
drive
out
to
the
monastery
of
tre
fontane
but
the
matter
did
not
eventually
arrange
itself
as
happily
as
he
had
hoped
since
he
found
himself
in
one
carriage
and
marcia
in
the
other
at
the
monastery
the
monks
were
saying
office
in
the
main
chapel
when
they
arrived
and
they
paused
a
few
minutes
to
listen
to
the
deep
rise
and
fall
of
the
gregorian
chant
as
it
echoed
through
the
long
bare
nave
the
dim
interior
the
low
monotonous
music
the
unseen
monks
made
an
effective
whole
paul
awake
to
the
possibilities
of
the
occasion
did
his
best
to
draw
marcia
into
conversation
but
she
was
tantalizingly
unresponsive
the
in
royston
s
hands
and
the
history
of
the
order
appeared
to
absorb
her
whole
attention
fortune
however
was
finally
on
his
side
royston
elected
to
stop
on
their
way
back
to
the
city
at
paul
s
without
the
walls
and
the
whole
party
once
more
alighted
within
the
basilica
royston
in
hand
commenced
her
usual
conscientious
inspection
while
eleanor
and
the
young
frenchman
strolled
about
commenting
on
the
architecture
margaret
had
heard
that
one
of
the
mosaic
popes
in
the
frieze
had
diamond
eyes
and
she
was
insistently
bent
on
finding
him
marcia
and
paul
followed
her
a
few
minutes
but
they
had
both
seen
the
church
many
times
before
and
both
were
at
present
but
mildly
interested
in
popes
the
door
of
the
cloisters
stood
ajar
and
they
presently
left
the
others
and
strolled
into
the
peaceful
enclosure
with
its
floor
and
quaintly
twisted
columns
it
was
tranquil
and
empty
with
no
suggestion
of
the
outside
world
they
turned
and
strolled
down
the
length
of
the
flagging
where
the
shadow
of
the
columns
alternated
with
gleaming
bars
of
sunshine
the
sleepy
atmosphere
cast
its
spell
about
them
marcia
s
tantalizing
humour
and
paul
s
impatience
fell
away
they
walked
on
in
silence
until
presently
the
silence
made
itself
awkward
and
marcia
began
to
talk
about
the
carving
of
the
columns
the
flowers
in
the
garden
the
monks
who
tended
them
paul
responded
half
abstractedly
and
he
finally
broke
out
with
what
he
was
thinking
of
a
talk
they
had
had
that
afternoon
several
weeks
before
in
the
borghese
gardens
most
men
wouldn
t
care
for
this
he
nodded
toward
the
prim
little
garden
with
its
violets
and
roses
framed
in
by
the
pillared
cloister
and
higher
up
by
the
dull
grey
walls
of
the
church
and
monastery
but
a
few
do
since
that
is
the
case
why
not
let
the
majority
mine
their
coal
and
build
their
railroads
and
the
very
small
minority
who
do
care
stay
and
appreciate
it
it
is
fortunate
that
we
don
t
all
like
the
same
things
for
there
s
a
great
variety
of
work
to
be
done
of
course
he
added
i
know
well
enough
i
m
never
going
to
do
anything
very
great
i
don
t
set
up
for
a
genius
but
to
do
a
few
little
things
t
that
something
they
had
reached
the
opposite
end
of
the
cloisters
and
paused
by
one
of
the
pillars
leaning
against
the
balustrade
you
think
it
s
shirking
one
s
duty
not
to
live
in
america
he
asked
i
don
t
know
marcia
smiled
vaguely
i
i
m
changing
my
i
only
know
of
one
thing
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
would
make
me
want
to
be
exiled
from
marcia
had
a
quick
foreboding
that
she
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
her
eyes
asked
what
is
that
paul
looked
down
at
the
pavement
in
silence
and
then
he
looked
up
in
her
face
and
smiled
steadily
if
you
lived
out
of
marcia
received
this
in
silence
while
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
effigy
of
a
dead
monk
set
in
the
pavement
and
commenced
mechanically
following
the
latin
inscription
there
was
still
time
she
was
still
mistress
of
the
situation
by
a
laugh
an
adroit
turn
she
could
overlook
his
words
could
bring
their
relations
back
again
to
their
normal
footing
but
she
was
by
no
means
sure
that
she
wished
to
bring
them
back
to
their
normal
footing
she
felt
a
sudden
quite
strong
curiosity
to
know
what
he
would
say
next
hang
it
marcia
he
exclaimed
i
suppose
you
want
to
marry
a
prince
or
something
like
that
a
prince
she
inquired
why
a
prince
oh
it
s
what
you
women
are
always
a
coronet
on
your
carriage
door
with
all
the
servants
bowing
and
saying
si
every
time
you
turn
it
would
be
fun
she
agreed
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
desirable
unmarried
princes
there
aren
t
no
why
i
met
one
the
other
day
that
i
thought
quite
charming
his
family
is
seven
hundred
years
old
and
he
owns
two
castles
and
three
he
wouldn
t
stay
charming
you
d
find
the
castles
damp
and
the
villages
dirty
and
the
prince
he
dropped
his
hand
over
hers
where
it
rested
on
the
balustrade
you
d
better
take
me
marcia
in
the
long
run
you
ll
find
me
marcia
shook
her
head
but
she
did
not
draw
away
her
hand
really
paul
i
don
t
there
s
nothing
i
hate
so
much
in
the
world
as
making
up
my
mind
you
shouldn
t
ask
such
unanswerable
look
mamma
aren
t
the
cloisters
lovely
margaret
s
voice
suddenly
sounded
across
the
little
court
oh
there
are
marcia
and
paul
over
there
we
wondered
where
you
had
disappeared
oh
the
deuce
paul
exclaimed
as
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
leaned
back
against
the
pillar
i
told
you
he
added
with
a
laugh
that
my
family
always
arrived
when
they
were
not
wanted
they
all
strolled
about
together
and
marcia
scarcely
glanced
at
him
again
but
her
consciousness
was
filled
with
his
words
and
it
required
all
her
to
keep
up
her
part
of
the
conversation
as
they
started
on
royston
suggested
that
they
stop
a
second
time
at
the
english
cemetery
just
within
the
gate
marcia
looking
at
her
watch
saw
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
she
would
have
to
go
straight
on
if
she
were
to
catch
copley
and
gerald
in
time
for
the
six
o
clock
train
bidding
them
at
the
porta
san
paolo
she
hastily
and
emphatically
refused
paul
s
proposition
to
drive
to
the
station
with
her
no
indeed
dessart
she
called
out
as
he
was
making
arrangements
with
royston
to
meet
later
at
the
hotel
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
with
me
i
shouldn
t
think
of
taking
you
away
my
aunt
will
be
at
the
station
and
i
am
perfectly
capable
of
getting
there
alone
really
i
don
t
want
to
trouble
he
put
his
foot
on
the
it
s
no
trouble
he
smiled
no
no
i
would
rather
go
alone
i
shall
be
angry
if
you
come
she
insisted
in
a
low
tone
the
young
man
shrugged
and
removed
his
foot
from
the
step
as
you
please
he
returned
in
a
tone
which
carried
an
impression
of
slightly
wounded
feelings
the
driver
looked
back
expectantly
waiting
for
his
directions
paul
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
turned
toward
her
again
as
if
inquiring
the
way
is
there
any
hope
for
me
he
said
she
looked
away
without
answering
there
s
no
other
man
he
added
quickly
marcia
for
a
second
looked
up
in
his
face
no
she
shook
her
head
there
s
no
other
he
straightened
up
with
a
happy
laugh
then
i
ll
win
he
whispered
and
he
shook
her
hand
as
if
on
a
compact
he
called
to
the
driver
and
as
the
carriage
started
marcia
glanced
back
and
nodded
toward
the
roystons
with
a
quick
smile
for
paul
chapter
viii
ah
sybert
you
re
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
melville
came
up
the
walk
of
the
palazzo
occupied
by
the
american
ambassador
as
sybert
emerging
from
the
door
paused
on
the
top
step
to
draw
on
his
gloves
in
that
case
the
latter
returned
it
s
well
you
didn
t
come
five
minutes
later
or
i
should
have
been
lost
to
the
world
for
the
afternoon
what
s
up
nothing
serious
can
you
spare
me
a
few
moments
talk
i
won
t
take
up
your
time
if
you
are
in
a
not
in
the
least
i
m
entirely
at
your
disposal
nothing
on
for
the
afternoon
and
i
was
preparing
to
the
two
turned
back
into
the
house
and
crossed
the
hall
to
the
ambassador
s
private
library
melville
closed
the
door
and
regarded
his
companion
a
trifle
quizzically
sybert
dropped
into
a
chair
indicated
another
and
pushed
a
box
of
cigars
and
some
matches
across
the
table
then
he
looked
up
and
caught
melville
s
expression
well
what
s
up
he
asked
again
the
selected
a
cigar
with
some
deliberation
bit
off
the
end
and
regarded
it
critically
while
his
smile
broadened
i
have
just
returned
from
the
mass
meeting
of
the
foreign
residents
he
remarked
that
should
have
been
it
was
he
admitted
there
was
some
spirited
discussion
as
to
the
best
way
of
suppressing
the
and
how
did
they
decide
to
do
it
they
have
appointed
a
of
course
a
committee
sybert
laughed
and
what
is
the
committee
to
do
wait
on
the
ministers
and
invite
them
to
reconstruct
their
morals
ask
the
king
to
spend
a
little
less
money
on
the
soldiers
uniforms
and
a
little
more
on
their
rations
the
committee
said
melville
is
to
raise
money
for
food
and
to
assist
the
government
as
far
as
possible
in
quieting
the
people
and
suppressing
the
ah
breathed
sybert
and
he
added
with
his
eye
on
the
young
man
i
have
the
honour
of
informing
you
that
you
were
made
oh
the
devil
this
is
not
an
official
notification
he
pursued
blandly
but
i
thought
you
d
like
to
hear
the
who
s
at
the
bottom
of
this
why
in
heaven
s
name
didn
t
you
stop
them
i
couldn
t
very
well
i
was
chairman
of
the
sybert
s
usual
easy
nonchalance
had
vanished
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
one
or
two
turns
about
the
room
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
be
shoved
into
wish
some
of
these
officious
fools
would
go
back
home
where
they
belong
i
won
t
serve
on
any
such
committee
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
will
i
ll
nonsense
sybert
you
can
t
do
that
it
would
be
too
marked
people
would
think
you
had
some
reason
for
not
wanting
to
serve
it
was
very
natural
that
your
name
should
have
occurred
for
the
position
you
have
lived
in
rome
longer
than
most
of
us
and
are
supposed
to
understand
the
conditions
and
to
be
interested
in
good
it
puts
me
in
a
mighty
queer
i
don
t
see
the
elder
man
s
tone
had
grown
cool
they
naturally
took
it
for
granted
that
you
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
would
want
to
have
the
riots
suppressed
and
choke
off
any
latent
tendencies
toward
revolution
in
this
precious
it
was
the
work
of
a
lot
of
damned
busybodies
who
wanted
to
see
what
i
would
melville
suppressed
a
momentary
smile
however
he
remarked
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
be
so
reluctant
about
serving
in
a
good
don
t
suppose
you
wish
to
see
a
revolution
any
more
than
the
rest
of
heavens
no
it
wouldn
t
do
any
good
the
government
s
got
the
army
to
back
it
the
revolutionists
would
only
be
sent
to
the
galleys
for
their
trouble
and
the
police
oppression
would
be
worse
than
he
swung
up
and
down
the
room
a
couple
of
times
and
then
pausing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
stared
moodily
out
of
the
window
melville
smoked
and
watched
him
a
shade
of
uneasiness
in
his
glance
just
what
position
laurence
sybert
occupied
in
unofficial
position
that
a
mystery
to
the
most
of
his
friends
melville
understood
him
as
well
as
any
one
with
the
exception
of
howard
copley
but
even
he
was
at
times
quite
unprepared
for
the
intimate
knowledge
sybert
displayed
in
affairs
which
on
the
surface
did
not
concern
him
sybert
was
distinctly
not
a
babbler
and
this
tendency
toward
being
had
given
rise
to
a
vast
amount
of
speculative
interest
in
his
movements
he
carried
the
reputation
among
the
foreign
residents
of
knowing
more
about
italian
politics
than
the
premier
himself
and
he
further
carried
the
deserved
or
mixing
rather
more
deeply
than
was
wise
in
the
dark
undercurrent
of
the
government
and
this
particular
spring
the
undercurrent
was
unusually
dark
and
dangerously
swift
young
italy
had
been
sowing
wild
oats
and
the
crop
was
ripening
fast
it
was
a
period
of
anxiety
and
disappointment
for
those
who
had
watched
the
country
s
brave
struggle
for
unity
and
independence
thirty
years
before
victor
emmanuel
cavour
and
garibaldi
had
passed
away
the
patriots
had
retired
and
the
politicians
had
come
in
a
long
period
of
of
dishonesty
and
incompetence
of
wild
building
schemes
and
crushing
taxes
had
brought
the
country
s
credit
to
the
lowest
possible
ebb
a
series
of
disgraceful
bank
scandals
involving
men
highest
in
the
government
had
shaken
the
confidence
of
the
people
the
failure
of
the
italian
colony
in
africa
and
the
campaign
against
king
menelik
and
his
dervishes
with
thousands
of
wounded
conscripts
sent
back
to
their
homes
had
carried
the
discontent
to
every
corner
of
the
kingdom
and
fast
on
the
heels
of
this
disaster
had
come
a
failure
in
the
wheat
crop
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
while
simultaneously
the
corner
in
the
american
market
was
forcing
up
the
price
of
foreign
wheat
to
twice
its
normal
value
it
was
a
time
when
priests
were
recalling
to
the
peasants
the
wrongs
the
church
had
suffered
a
time
when
the
socialist
presses
were
turning
out
pamphlets
containing
plain
truths
plainly
stated
a
time
when
investors
refused
to
invest
in
government
bonds
and
even
italian
statesmen
were
beginning
to
look
grave
to
the
casual
eyes
of
tourists
the
country
was
still
as
picturesquely
raggedly
gay
as
ever
there
were
perhaps
more
beggars
on
the
church
steps
and
their
appeal
for
bread
was
a
trifle
more
insistent
but
for
people
interested
only
in
italy
s
galleries
and
ruins
and
shops
the
changes
were
not
marked
but
those
who
did
understand
who
cared
for
the
future
of
the
nation
who
saw
the
seething
below
the
surface
were
passing
through
a
phase
of
disillusionment
and
doubt
and
laurence
sybert
was
one
who
both
understood
and
cared
he
saw
the
direction
in
which
the
country
was
drifting
even
better
perhaps
than
the
italians
themselves
he
looked
on
in
a
detached
more
remote
fashion
not
so
swept
by
the
current
as
those
who
were
in
the
stream
but
if
he
were
detached
in
accident
of
his
american
parentage
and
feelings
he
was
with
the
italians
heart
and
soul
the
remained
some
minutes
silently
studying
the
younger
man
s
expressive
obstinacy
something
stronger
appeared
in
every
line
of
his
squared
he
rose
and
walked
across
to
the
window
see
here
sybert
he
said
bluntly
i
m
your
friend
and
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
doing
anything
foolish
i
know
where
your
sympathies
are
and
if
the
rest
of
us
looked
into
the
matter
with
our
eyes
open
it
s
possible
ours
would
be
on
the
same
side
but
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
we
couldn
t
do
any
good
and
you
can
t
either
you
must
think
of
your
own
are
secretary
of
the
american
embassy
and
nephew
of
the
ambassador
in
common
decency
it
won
t
do
to
exhibit
too
much
sympathy
with
the
enemies
of
the
italian
government
you
say
yourself
that
you
don
t
want
to
see
a
revolution
then
it
s
your
duty
in
the
interests
of
law
and
order
to
do
all
you
can
to
suppress
oh
i
m
willing
to
do
all
i
can
toward
relieving
the
suffering
and
quieting
the
people
but
when
it
comes
to
playing
the
police
spy
and
getting
these
poor
devils
jailed
for
twenty
years
because
they
ve
shouted
down
with
savoy
i
melville
shrugged
that
part
of
the
business
can
be
left
to
the
secret
police
they
re
capable
of
handling
i
don
t
doubt
that
sybert
growled
your
business
is
merely
to
aid
in
pacifying
the
people
and
to
raise
subscriptions
for
buying
food
you
are
in
with
the
wealthy
foreigners
and
can
get
money
out
of
them
easier
than
i
suppose
that
means
i
am
to
bleed
copley
i
dare
say
he
ll
be
willing
enough
to
give
it
s
in
his
line
of
course
he
s
a
friend
and
i
don
t
like
to
say
anything
i
know
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
getting
up
the
wheat
deal
but
it
s
all
in
the
family
and
he
won
t
lose
by
it
the
corner
is
playing
the
deuce
with
italy
and
it
s
his
place
to
help
a
what
is
playing
the
deuce
with
italy
is
an
extravagant
government
and
crushing
taxes
and
dead
industries
the
wheat
famine
is
bad
enough
but
that
isn
t
the
main
trouble
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
the
main
trouble
his
companion
broke
in
sharply
is
the
fact
that
the
priests
and
the
anarchists
and
the
socialists
and
every
other
sort
of
meddling
malcontent
keep
things
so
stirred
up
that
the
government
is
forced
into
the
stand
it
sybert
whirled
around
from
the
window
and
faced
him
with
black
brows
and
a
sudden
flaring
of
passion
in
his
eyes
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
controlled
himself
and
went
on
in
a
quiet
i
suppose
the
socialists
and
priests
and
the
rest
of
your
malcontents
forced
our
late
premier
into
office
and
kept
him
there
i
suppose
they
yoked
italy
with
the
triple
alliance
and
drove
the
soldiers
into
abyssinia
to
be
butchered
like
hogs
i
suppose
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
bank
scandals
and
put
the
charity
money
into
official
pockets
and
let
fifteen
thousand
peasants
go
mad
with
hunger
last
thousand
his
voice
suddenly
broke
and
he
away
good
lord
melville
the
poverty
in
italy
is
something
appalling
yes
i
dare
say
it
just
the
same
that
s
only
one
side
of
the
question
the
country
is
new
and
you
can
t
expect
it
to
develop
along
every
line
at
once
the
government
has
committed
some
very
natural
blunders
but
at
the
same
time
it
has
accomplished
a
vast
amount
of
good
it
has
united
a
lot
of
chaotic
states
with
different
traditions
and
different
aims
into
one
organic
whole
it
has
built
up
a
modern
nation
with
all
the
machinery
of
modern
civilization
in
an
incalculably
short
time
of
course
the
people
have
had
to
pay
for
it
with
a
good
many
every
great
political
change
there
are
those
who
suffer
it
s
inevitable
but
the
suffering
is
only
temporary
and
the
good
is
permanent
you
ve
been
keeping
your
eyes
so
closely
on
passing
events
that
you
re
in
danger
of
losing
your
sybert
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
quick
resumption
of
his
usual
indifference
we
ve
had
years
of
united
italy
and
what
has
it
accomplished
he
demanded
it
s
built
up
one
of
the
finest
standing
armies
in
europe
if
you
like
a
lot
of
railroads
it
didn
t
need
some
aqueducts
and
and
a
postal
and
telegraph
system
it
has
erected
any
number
of
gigantic
public
buildings
of
theatres
and
arcades
and
statues
of
victor
emmanuel
ii
but
what
has
it
done
for
the
poor
people
beyond
taxing
them
to
pay
for
these
things
what
has
it
done
for
sicily
and
sardinia
for
the
pellagra
victims
of
the
north
for
the
peasants
of
the
agra
romana
why
does
sicily
hold
the
primacy
of
crime
in
europe
why
has
emigration
reached
two
hundred
thousand
a
year
parliament
votes
five
million
lire
for
a
palace
of
justice
and
lets
a
man
be
murdered
in
prison
by
his
keepers
without
the
show
of
a
trial
the
government
supports
plenty
of
universities
for
the
sons
of
the
rich
but
where
are
the
elementary
schools
for
the
peasants
certainly
italy
s
a
great
that
s
all
you
her
people
can
take
their
choice
between
emigrating
and
yes
it
s
bad
i
know
but
that
it
s
quite
as
bad
as
you
would
have
us
believe
i
doubt
you
re
a
pessimist
by
conviction
sybert
you
won
t
look
at
the
silver
the
silver
linings
are
pretty
thin
he
retorted
italian
politics
have
changed
since
the
days
of
victor
emmanuel
and
that
s
only
natural
you
could
scarcely
expect
any
nation
to
keep
up
such
a
high
pitch
of
patriotism
as
went
to
the
making
of
united
country
s
settled
down
a
bit
but
the
elements
of
strength
are
still
the
country
s
settled
down
a
good
bit
he
agreed
oh
yes
i
believe
least
i
it
s
only
a
passing
phase
the
italian
people
have
too
much
inherent
strength
to
allow
themselves
to
be
mastered
long
by
corrupt
politicians
but
that
the
country
is
in
pretty
low
water
now
and
that
the
breakers
are
not
far
ahead
no
one
with
his
eyes
open
can
doubt
the
parliament
is
wasteful
and
senseless
and
dishonest
the
taxes
are
crushing
the
public
debt
is
enormous
the
currency
is
debased
if
such
a
government
can
t
take
care
of
itself
i
don
t
see
that
it
s
the
business
of
foreigners
to
help
that
is
just
the
point
sybert
the
government
can
take
care
of
itself
and
it
will
the
foreigners
out
of
common
humanity
ought
to
help
the
people
as
much
as
they
sybert
appeared
to
study
melville
s
face
for
a
few
moments
then
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
examined
the
floor
this
is
a
time
for
those
in
power
to
choose
their
way
very
carefully
there
are
a
good
many
discontented
people
and
the
government
is
going
to
have
more
of
a
pull
than
you
think
to
hold
its
s
revolution
in
the
melville
faced
him
squarely
for
goodness
sake
sybert
i
don
t
know
how
much
influence
you
have
or
anything
about
it
but
do
what
you
can
to
keep
things
quiet
of
course
the
government
has
made
what
government
has
not
but
until
there
s
something
better
to
be
substituted
there
s
no
use
kicking
plainly
the
people
are
too
ignorant
to
govern
themselves
and
the
house
of
savoy
is
the
only
means
of
sybert
waved
his
hand
impatiently
i
haven
t
been
trying
to
undermine
the
government
i
assure
you
i
know
well
enough
that
for
a
good
many
years
to
come
italy
won
t
have
anything
better
to
offer
and
all
my
influence
with
the
naturally
isn
t
been
advice
of
the
same
nature
i
know
very
well
that
if
any
radical
change
were
attempted
only
anarchy
would
result
so
i
counsel
these
poor
starving
beggars
patience
like
a
skulking
very
well
i
don
t
see
then
why
you
have
any
objection
to
keeping
on
with
your
counsel
and
at
the
same
time
give
them
something
to
it
s
the
looks
of
the
up
openly
on
the
side
of
the
authorities
when
i
m
not
with
them
in
it
s
a
long
sight
better
for
a
person
in
your
position
than
standing
up
openly
against
the
oh
as
for
that
i
m
thinking
of
resigning
from
the
legation
and
then
i
ll
be
free
to

i
melville
laid
his
hand
on
the
younger

shoulder
sybert
you
may
resign
from
the
legation
but
you
re
still
your
uncle

nephew
you
can
t
resign

you

would
cast

fond
of

a
fool
an

without

repeated
i

it

italy

in
the
end
do
for
herself
and
no
outsider
can
be
of
any
i
shall
at

have
my

if
you
will
let
me
speak
plainly
the
best
thing
you
can
do
for
yourself
and
your
family
for
america
and
italy
is
as
you
say
to
resign
from

sybert
raised
his
head
with
a
little
laugh
but
with
a
flash
underneath
of
the
real
self
which
he
kept
so
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
i
was
born
in
italy
i
was
brought
up
here
just
as
little
gerald
copley
is
being

i
have
lived
here
all
my
life
except
for
half
a
dozen
years
or
so
while
i
was
being
educated
all
my
interests
all
my
sympathies
are
in
italy
and
you
ask
me
to
i

no

to
go
to
if
you
take

away
from

you

a

look
italian

you
can

a
man
s
nationality
lies
deeper
than
all
externals
you
re
an
american
through
and
through
and
it
s
a
pity
you
can
t
be
a
little
proud
of
the
fact
the
only
way
in
which
there
s
going
to
be
any
progress
in
the
world
for
a
good
long
time
to
come
is
for
italians
to
care
for
italy
and
americans
for
america
we
aren
t
ready
just
yet
to
do
away
with
national
boundaries
and
if
we
were
we
should
run
up
against
racial
boundaries
which
are
still
more
unchangeable
america
is
quite
as
good
a
country
to
care
about
as
are
some
who
think
it
s
better
it
depends
on
the
point
of
oh
that
s
true
enough
sybert
returned
with
a
short
laugh
everything
in
the
world
depends
on
one
s
point
of
view
the
worst
place
is
all
right
if
you
only
choose
to
think
so
i
dare
say
hell
would
be
pleasurable
enough
to
a
salamander
but
the
point
m
not
a
melville
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
and
turned
back
to
his
seat
there
s
no
use
arguing
with
you
i
know
that
you
re
wasting
your
ability
where
it
isn
t
appreciated
but
i
suppose
it
s
nobody
s
business
but
your
own
some
day
you
ll
see
the
truth
yourself
and
i
hope
it
won
t
be
too
late
but
now
as
to
this
committee
your
uncle
s
sake
you
ought
to
carry
it
through
i
will
tell
you
imagine
it
isn
t
the
italian
government
has
its
eye
on
you
and
if
you
manage
to
get
yourself
arrested
rightly
or
wrongly
for
stirring
up
sedition
it
will
make
an
ugly
story
in
the
papers
the
editor
and
staff
of
the
del
were
arrested
this
morning
the
police
are
opening
telegrams
and
letters
and
watching
suspicious
persons
you

better

sybert
laughed
with
a
gesture
of
dissent
there
s
no
danger
about
me
the
enthusiastic
head
of
the
foreign
relief
committee
is
safe
from

you

act
then
oh
i
don
t
ll
think
it
over
it
s
a
deuced
hole
to
have
got
into
though
i
suppose
it
is
as
you
say
about
the
only
way
to

i
can
raise
money
and
distribute
bread
as
well
as

like
this
we
re
all
willing
to
step
aside
a
bit
i

glad
you
ve
decided
to
work
on

side
of

it
is
as
things

the
only
sensible
thing
to
i
haven

decided
yet
and
i
do
not
as
i
told
you
before
care
a
rap
what
becomes
of
the
government
it

the
people
i

it
amounts
to
the
same
not
in
oh
very
well
you
re
incorrigible
at
least
keep
your
opinions
to
i
m
not
likely
to
shout
them
abroad
under
the
present
régime
and
as
to
this
infernal
well
i
ll
think
about
very
well
think
favourably
it
s
the
only
way
to
help
very
good
policy
into
the
bargain
some
day
my
boy
maybe
you
ll
grow
sensible
sybert
paced
up
and
down
the
room
for
five
or
ten
minutes
after
melville
had
left
and
then
picked
up
his
hat
and
started
out
again
turning
toward
the
piazza
barberini
he
strode
along
scowling
unconsciously
at
the
he
bowed
mechanically
to
the
people
who
bowed
to
him
along
the
corso
he
met
the
procession
of
carriages
going
toward
the
pincio
ladies
nodded
graciously
they
even
to
look
after
him
but
he
was
quite
unaware
of
it
his
thoughts
were
not
with
the
portion
of
roman
society
which
rode
in
carriages
he
traversed
the
corso
and
plunged
into
the
tangle
of
more
or
less
dirty
streets
on
the
left
bank
of
the
tiber
here
the
crowds
who
elbowed
their
way
along
the
narrow
sidewalks
were
more
poorly
dressed
after
some
twenty
minutes
walking
he
turned
into
a
narrow
street
in
the
region
of
the
grimy
ruins
of
the
theatre
of
marcellus
and
paused
before
the
doorway
of
a
which
bore
upon
its
front
the
ambitious
title
osteria
del
popolo
with
a
barely
perceptible
glance
over
his
shoulder
he
stepped
into
the
dingy
little
café
which
opened
from
the
street
the
front
room
with
its
square
wooden
tables
and
chairs
was
empty
except
for
madame
tarquinio
paterno
who
was
sweeping
the
floor
sybert
nodded
to
her
and
crossing
the
room
to
the
rear
door
which
opened
into
the
knocked
twice
the
door
opened
a
crack
for
purposes
of
examination
and
then
was
thrown
wide
to
admit
him
the
room
which
was
revealed
was
a
kitchen
lighted
in
the
rear
by
a
window
opening
on
to
a
gloomy
lighted
is
scarcely
the
word
to
use
for
between
the
dirt
on
the
panes
and
the
dimness
of
the
court
very
little
daylight
struggled
in
but
the
interior
was
not
dreary
a
charcoal
fire
blazing
on
the
high
stone
hearth
shot
up
fiercely
every
now
and
then
throwing
grotesque
high
lights
on
the
faces
of
the
men
grouped
about
the
room
sybert
paused
on
the
threshold
and
glanced
about
from
face
to
face
three
or
four
men
were
sitting
on
low
benches
about
a
long
table
drinking
wine
and
talking
the
one
who
was
in
the
act
of
speaking
as
sybert
appeared
in
the
door
paused
with
his
mouth
still
open
the
others
recognizing
him
however
called
out
a
cordial
signor
siberti
while
tarquinio
hastened
to
place
a
chair
and
bring
a
tall
flask
of
red
frascati
wine
sybert
returned
their
salutations
and
sat
down
with
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
the
excited
stranger
tarquinio
ceremoniously
presented
him
as
girolamo
mendamo
of
naples
and
he
ended
his
introduction
with
the
assurance
have
no
fear
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
one
of
us
and
left
it
to
be
conjectured
as
to
whether
the
compliment
referred
to
sybert
or
the
neapolitan
the
latter
took
it
to
refer
to
sybert
and
after
a
momentary
hesitation
picked
up
his
discourse
where
he
had
dropped
it
ah
and
when
the
poor
fishermen
are
sickening
for
a
little
salt
and
try
to
get
it
from
the
sea
water
without
paying
what
do
the
police
do
they
throw
them
into
prison
the
camorra
used
to
protect
people
from
the
police
but
now
the
camorra
no
longer
dares
to
lift
its
head
and
the
people
have
no
protectors
it
used
to
be
that
when
the
police
wanted
more
money
it
satisfied
them
to
raise
the
taxes
but
now
they
must
raise
the
price
of
bread
and
macaroni
as
he
had
commenced
in
a
low
tone
but
as
he
proceeded
his
voice
rose
higher
and
higher
and
last
week
a
great
crowd
broke
open
the
bakeries
and
carried
off
the
flour
and
the
police
were
frightened
and
put
down
the
not
enough
then
the
people
threatened
again
and
all
the
tax
was
taken
off
that
is
the
way
to
deal
with
the
police
they
are
cowards
and
it
is
only
fear
that
makes
them
the
man
laughed
hoarsely
and
looked
around
for
approval
the
others
nodded
he
speaks
the
truth
it
is
only
fear
that
makes
them
they
are
repeated
the
neapolitan
if
all
the
people
in
every
city
of
italy
would
do
the
same
there
would
soon
be
no
more
taxes
and
no
more
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
mistaken
there
my
friend
sybert
broke
in
there
will
always
be
taxes
and
always
be
police
but
it
s
true
as
you
say
that
the
taxes
are
too
heavy
and
the
police
are
unjust
the
time
hasn
t
come
though
when
you
can
gain
anything
by
rioting
and
revolutions
the
government
s
backed
by
the
army
and
it
s
too
strong
for
you
you
may
possibly
frighten
it
into
lowering
the
wheat
tax
for
a
time
but
it
will
be
at
a
mighty
heavy
cost
to
the
ones
who
are
found
who
are
you
the
man
demanded
suspiciously
i
am
an
american
who
would
like
to
see
italy
as
happy
and
prosperous
and
well
governed
as
the
united
sybert
smiled
inwardly
at
the
ideal
he
was
holding
up
re
a
spy
the
man
cried
with
a
quick
scowl
i
am
so
far
from
being
a
spy
that
i
have
come
to
warn
you
that
if
you
don
t
want
to
spend
the
next
few
years
of
your
lives
in
prison
you
must
be
very
careful
to
cheer
the
house
of
savoy
on
the
first
of
may
the
police
spies
are
keeping
both
eyes
open
just
the
others
nodded
their
heads
pacifically
but
the
neapolitan
still
scowled
he
suddenly
leaned
forward
across
the
table
and
scanned
sybert
with
eyes
that
glittered
fiercely
in
the
firelight
then
he
burst
out
again
in
low
guttural
it
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
signor
you
have
bread
to
eat
but
if
you
worked
all
day
from
sunrise
to
until
you
grew
so
tired
you
couldn
t
sleep
and
then
got
up
and
worked
then
if
the
police
came
and
took
away
all
the
money
in
taxes
and
didn
t
even
leave
enough
to
buy
your
family
food
and
the
work
gave
out
so
you
must
either
steal
or
die
and
you
couldn
t
find
anything
to
you
would
sing
another
song
wait
wait
you
say
it
s
always
wait
will
better
times
ever
come
if
we
sit
down
and
wait
for
them
who
will
give
us
the
better
times
the
king
perhaps
umberto
the
man
broke
off
with
a
harsh
laugh
shall
die
waiting
and
our
children
after
us
and
when
we
are
dead
the
good
god
will
keep
us
waiting
outside
of
paradise
because
there
is
no
money
to
pay
for
masses
no
one
cares
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
themselves
it
s
the
poor
people
who
haven
t
enough
to
eat
who
buy
the
gold
braid
on
the
king
s
clothes
and
pay
for
the
carriages
of
his
ministers
in
my
opinion
we
would
do
better
to
buy
bread
for
our
children
sybert
looked
back
in
the
man
s
burning
face
and
his
own
caught
fire
he
knew
that
every
word
he
said
was
true
and
he
knew
how
hopeless
was
his
remedy
what
could
these
passionate
ignorant
peasants
blazing
with
rage
do
with
power
if
they
had
it
worse
than
nothing
their
own
condition
would
only
be
rendered
more
desperate
than
ever
he
glanced
about
the
table
from
one
face
to
another
they
were
all
leaning
forward
waiting
for
his
answer
the
fierce
eagerness
in
their
eyes
was
contagious
a
sudden
wave
of
hopeless
pity
for
them
swept
him
off
his
feet
and
for
a
moment
he
lost
himself
my
god
men
he
burst
out
i
know
it
s
true
i
know
you
re
starving
while
others
spend
your
money
there
s
no
justice
for
you
and
there
never
will
be
the
only
thing
i
want
in
the
world
is
to
see
italy
happy
i
am
as
ready
to
die
for
it
as
you
are
but
what
can
i
do
what
can
any
one
do
the
soldiers
are
stronger
than
we
are
and
if
we
raise
our
hands
they
will
shoot
us
down
like
dogs
and
there
it
will
he
paused
with
a
deep
breath
and
went
on
in
a
quieter
tone
patience
is
poor
food
to
offer
to
starving
men
but
it
s
the
one
hope
now
for
you
and
for
italy
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
for
honest
ministers
are
all
alike
said
one
and
who
will
feed
us
while
we
are
waiting
for
election
day
asked
another
who
had
been
listening
silently
the
question
was
unanswerable
and
sybert
sat
frowning
down
at
the
table
without
speaking
the
neapolitan
presently
broke
in
again
there
was
something
electric
about
his
words
and
the
force
behind
them
every
one
bent
forward
to
listen
who
is
the
king
he
demanded
he
is
only
a
man
so
am
i
a
man
then
what
makes
him
so
different
from
me
they
may
shoot
me
down
if
they
like
but
first
i
have
work
to
do
the
king
shall
know
me
before
i
die
and
he
is
not
all
he
added
darkly
do
you
know
why
the
wheat
s
so
scarce
because
of
a
here
in
that
put
down
the
camorra
in
naples
and
throws
the
beggars
into
an
angry
mutter
ran
around
the
room
you
re
mistaken
there
sybert
interrupted
it
s
not
this
signor
copli
who
bought
the
wheat
it
s
his
brother
in
america
this
signor
copli
is
the
friend
of
the
poor
people
many
many
thousand
lire
he
gives
away
every
year
and
no
one
knows
about
a
more
friendly
murmur
arose
but
the
neapolitan
was
still
unconvinced
it
is
the
same
signor
copli
he
affirmed
stubbornly
he
hides
the
wheat
in
america
where
he
thinks
no
one
will
know
about
it
and
then
after
stealing
it
all
from
the
mouths
of
the
poor
he
gives
a
little
back
with
a
great
show
thinking
to
blind
us
but
we
know
the
del
printed
it
out
in
black
and
white
for
all
who
can
to
and
the
del
was
stopped
this
morning
and
the
editor
put
in
jail
for
printing
lies
said
sybert
sharply
ah
you
re
a
police
spy
you
pretend
to
be
for
us
to
make
us
his
hand
half
instinctively
went
to
his
belt
sybert
rose
to
his
feet
and
dropped
his
hand
roughly
on
the
man
s
shoulder
the
best
thing
you
can
do
for
your
country
is
to
put
that
stiletto
into
the
he
turned
aside
with
an
expression
of
disgust
and
tossed
some
silver
coins
on
the
table
in
payment
for
the
wine
then
pausing
a
moment
he
glanced
about
the
circle
of
swarthy
faces
gradually
his
expression
softened
i
ve
tried
to
warn
you
the
police
are
on
the
watch
and
i
should
advise
you
to
stick
pretty
closely
to
your
homes
and
not
mix
up
in
any
riots
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
get
food
and
money
for
the
poor
know
of
no
other
way
to
help
heaven
knows
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
he
nodded
to
them
and
motioning
tarquinio
to
follow
passed
into
the
front
room
closing
the
door
behind
them
he
turned
to
the
innkeeper
tarquinio
i
think
you
had
better
go
up
into
the
hills
and
attend
to
your
vineyard
for
a
few
the
young
italian
s
face
was
the
picture
of
dismay
but
the
signor
siberti
who
will
manage
that
your
wife
can
look
after
it
let
it
be
given
out
that
you
are
tending
vines
in
the
sabine
hills
that
is
the
safest
profession
these
days
the
police
will
be
paying
you
a
visit
before
long
if
i
am
not
greatly
whatever
you
do
keep
out
fellows
like
that
tarquinio
s
face
darkened
with
a
quick
look
of
suspicion
i
am
but
a
poor
innkeeper
signor
siberti
i
must
welcome
those
who
sybert
shrugged
i
was
merely
speaking
for
your
own
safety
such
guests
are
dangerous
he
turned
toward
the
door
and
then
turned
back
a
moment
take
my
advice
tarquinio
and
visit
your
tarquinio
followed
him
to
the
threshold
and
bidding
him
a
voluble
in
the
face
of
the
world
begged
the
signor
americano
to
honour
his
humble
again
so
that
any
chance
might
regard
the
gentleman
as
but
a
casual
visitor
sybert
smiled
at
the
simple
strategy
an
italian
loves
a
plot
better
than
his
dinner
and
is
never
happier
than
when
engaged
in
an
imaginary
intrigue
but
in
this
case
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
host
s
caution
might
not
be
out
of
place
and
he
fervently
assured
tarquinio
that
the
wine
had
been
excellent
and
that
in
the
future
he
would
send
his
friends
to
the
del
popolo
chapter
ix
sybert
turned
away
from
the
with
a
at
tarquinio
s
little
play
with
a
at
the
fierce
words
of
the
neapolitan
which
were
still
ringing
in
his
head
he
walked
along
with
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
scarcely
aware
of
his
surroundings
until
an
excited
medley
of
voices
close
at
hand
suddenly
startled
him
from
his
thoughts
he
glanced
up
for
a
moment
with
unseeing
eyes
and
then
with
an
astonished
flash
of
recognition
as
he
beheld
marcia
copley
backed
against
one
of
the
dark
stone
arches
in
the
substructure
of
the
theatre
of
marcellus
her
head
was
thrown
back
and
there
were
two
angry
red
spots
in
her
cheeks
while
a
struggling
crowd
of
boys
pressed
around
her
with
shouts
and
gesticulations
as
he
paused
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
scene
he
heard
so
angry
that
she
had
forgotten
her
in
english
you
beastly
little
cowards
you
wouldn
t
dare
hurt
anything
but
a
poor
animal
that
can
t
hit
she
accompanied
this
speech
with
a
vigorous
shake
to
a
small
boy
whom
she
held
by
the
shoulder
the
boy
could
not
understand
her
words
but
he
did
understand
her
action
and
he
kicked
back
vigorously
the
crowd
laughed
and
began
to
close
around
her
she
took
out
her
purse
who
owns
this
dog
she
demanded
at
sight
of
the
money
they
pressed
closer
and
in
another
moment
would
have
snatched
it
away
but
sybert
stepped
forward
and
raising
his
cane
scattered
them
right
and
left
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
asked
oh
sybert
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
look
those
horrible
little
wretches
were
killing
this
sybert
glanced
down
at
her
feet
where
a
bedraggled
cur
was
crouching
shivering
and
looking
up
with
pleading
eyes
the
blood
was
running
from
a
cut
on
its
shoulder
and
a
motley
assortment
of
tin
was
tied
to
its
tail
by
a
cord
he
took
out
his
knife
and
cut
the
dog
loose
and
marcia
stooped
and
picked
it
up
take
care
miss
marcia
he
said
in
a
disgusted
tone
he
s
very
dirty
and
you
will
get
covered
with
marcia
put
her
handkerchief
over
the
dog
s
wound
and
it
lay
in
her
arms
whimpering
and
shaking
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
demanded
again
almost
roughly
what
are
you
doing
in
this
part
of
the
city
alone
his
tone
at
another
time
would
have
been
irritating
but
just
now
she
was
too
grateful
for
his
appearance
to
be
anything
but
cordial
and
she
hastily
i
ve
been
spending
the
afternoon
at
tre
fontane
with
some
friends
i
left
them
at
the
english
cemetery
and
was
just
driving
back
to
the
station
when
i
saw
those
miserable
little
boys
chasing
this
dog
i
jumped
out
and
grabbed
him
and
they
all
followed
i
see
said
sybert
and
it
is
fortunate
that
i
happened
by
when
i
did
or
you
wouldn
t
have
had
any
money
left
to
pay
your
these
roman
urchins
have
not
the
perfect
manners
one
could
manners
marcia
sniffed
indignantly
i
loathe
the
italians
i
think
they
are
the
cruellest
people
i
ever
saw
those
boys
were
stoning
this
poor
dog
to
i
dare
say
they
have
not
enjoyed
your
they
would
have
killed
him
if
i
hadn
t
come
just
when
i
you
are
not
going
out
to
the
villa
alone
no
aunt
katherine
and
gerald
are
going
to
meet
me
at
the
oh
very
well
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
evident
relief
as
they
turned
toward
the
waiting
carriage
let
me
take
the
dog
and
i
will
drop
him
a
few
streets
farther
on
where
the
boys
won
t
find
him
certainly
not
said
marcia
indignantly
some
other
boys
would
find
him
i
shall
take
him
home
and
feed
him
he
doesn
t
look
as
if
he
had
had
anything
to
eat
for
in
that
case
said
sybert
resignedly
i
will
drive
to
the
station
with
you
for
he
is
scarcely
a
and
you
may
have
trouble
getting
him
into
the
and
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
her
remonstrance
he
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
put
the
dog
on
the
floor
between
his
feet
the
dog
however
did
not
favour
the
change
and
stretching
up
an
appealing
paw
he
touched
marcia
s
knee
with
a
whine
you
poor
thing
stop
trembling
nobody
s
going
to
hurt
you
and
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
on
the
nose
marcia
was
excited
she
had
not
quite
recovered
her
equanimity
since
the
scene
with
paul
dessart
in
the
cloisters
and
the
affair
of
the
dog
had
upset
her
afresh
she
rattled
on
now
with
a
gaiety
quite
at
variance
with
her
usual
attitude
toward
sybert
of
anything
and
everything
that
came
into
her
s
broken
tooth
the
departure
of
marietta
the
afternoon
at
tre
fontane
and
the
episode
of
the
dog
sybert
listened
politely
but
his
thoughts
were
not
upon
her
words
he
was
too
full
of
what
he
had
left
behind
in
the
little
café
for
him
to
listen
patiently
to
marcia
s
chatter
as
he
looked
at
her
flushed
and
smiling
in
her
dainty
clothes
which
were
faultless
with
the
faultlessness
that
comes
from
money
he
experienced
a
feeling
almost
of
anger
against
her
he
longed
to
face
her
with
a
few
plain
truths
what
right
had
she
to
all
her
useless
luxuries
when
her
father
the
neapolitan
had
truly
put
his
money
from
the
mouths
of
the
poor
it
was
their
work
which
made
it
possible
for
such
as
she
to
was
she
worth
it
the
world
had
given
her
much
she
was
educated
she
was
cultured
she
had
trained
tastes
and
sensibilities
and
in
return
what
did
she
do
for
the
world
she
saved
a
dog
he
made
a
movement
of
disgust
and
for
a
moment
he
almost
obeyed
his
impulse
to
throw
the
dog
out
but
he
brought
himself
back
to
reason
with
a
it
was
not
her
fault
she
knew
nothing
of
her
father
s
transaction
she
knew
nothing
of
italy
s
need
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
happy
and
after
all
he
told
himself
wearily
it
was
a
relief
to
meet
some
one
who
had
no
troubles
marcia
suddenly
interrupted
her
own
light
discourse
to
look
at
her
watch
gracious
i
haven
t
much
time
will
you
please
tell
him
to
hurry
a
little
sybert
the
driver
obeyed
by
giving
his
horse
a
resounding
cut
with
the
whip
whereupon
marcia
jerked
him
by
the
and
told
him
that
if
he
whipped
his
horse
again
she
would
not
give
him
any
the
fellow
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
they
settled
down
into
a
walk
isn
t
there
any
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
she
asked
these
italians
are
you
can
scarcely
expect
them
to
expend
more
consideration
on
animals
than
they
receive
themselves
sybert
threw
off
oh
dear
she
complained
anew
suddenly
becoming
aware
of
their
pace
i
m
afraid
we
ll
be
late
for
the
train
don
t
you
suppose
he
could
hurry
just
a
little
without
whipping
the
horse
sybert
translated
her
wishes
to
the
driver
again
and
they
jogged
on
at
a
somewhat
livelier
rate
but
by
the
time
they
reached
the
station
the
train
had
gone
and
there
were
no
copley
and
gerald
in
the
marcia
s
face
was
slightly
blank
as
she
realized
the
situation
and
her
first
involuntary
thought
was
a
wish
that
it
had
been
paul
dessart
instead
of
sybert
who
had
come
with
her
she
carried
off
the
matter
with
a
laugh
however
and
explained
to
her
i
suppose
aunt
katherine
thought
i
had
decided
to
stay
in
the
city
with
the
roystons
i
told
her
i
was
going
to
but
i
found
they
had
a
dinner
engagement
it
doesn
t
matter
though
i
ll
wait
here
for
the
next
train
there
is
one
for
palestrina
before
very
katherine
went
by
way
of
tivoli
thank
you
very
much
sybert
for
coming
to
the
station
with
me
and
really
you
mustn
t
think
you
have
to
wait
until
the
train
goes
the
dog
will
be
company
sybert
consulted
his
time
schedule
in
silence
the
next
train
doesn
t
leave
till
seven
and
there
won
t
be
any
carriage
waiting
for
you
how
do
you
propose
to
get
out
to
the
villa
oh
the
at
palestrina
will
find
a
carriage
for
me
there
s
a
very
nice
man
who
s
often
driven
us
sybert
frowned
slightly
as
he
considered
the
question
it
was
rather
inconvenient
for
him
to
go
out
to
the
villa
that
night
but
he
reflected
that
it
was
his
duty
toward
copley
to
get
his
niece
back
to
letting
her
set
out
alone
on
a
drive
with
a
strange
palestrina
driver
that
was
clearly
out
of
the
question
i
think
i
ll
run
out
with
you
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
she
had
seen
his
frown
and
feared
some
such
proposition
no
indeed
she
cried
i
shouldn
t
think
of
letting
you
i
ve
been
over
the
same
road
hundreds
of
times
and
i
m
not
in
the
least
afraid
it
won
t
be
the
sabine
mountains
are
infested
with
bandits
he
declared
i
think
you
need
an
mr
sybert
how
silly
i
know
your
time
is
precious
this
was
intended
for
irony
but
as
it
happened
to
be
true
he
did
not
recognize
it
as
such
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
with
sybert
laughed
i
don
t
doubt
that
miss
marcia
but
i
m
coming
just
the
same
i
am
sorry
but
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
i
should
a
lot
rather
you
wouldn
t
she
returned
but
do
as
you
thank
you
for
the
invitation
he
smiled
there
s
about
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
train
might
run
out
to
the
embassy
and
have
a
cup
of
thank
you
for
the
invitation
but
i
think
i
ll
stay
here
i
don
t
wish
to
miss
a
second
train
and
i
shouldn
t
know
what
to
do
with
the
very
well
if
you
don
t
mind
staying
alone
i
will
drive
out
myself
and
leave
a
business
message
for
the
chief
and
then
i
can
take
a
vacation
with
a
clear
conscience
i
have
a
matter
to
consult
your
uncle
about
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
run
out
to
the
he
raised
his
hat
in
a
sufficiently
friendly
bow
and
departed
when
he
returned
an
hour
later
he
found
marcia
feeding
the
dog
with
sausage
amid
an
appreciative
group
of
porters
one
of
whom
had
procured
the
meat
oh
dear
she
cried
i
hoped
marcellus
would
have
finished
his
meal
before
you
came
back
but
you
aren
t
so
particular
about
etiquette
as
the
contessa
she
added
and
don
t
object
to
feeding
dogs
in
the
station
i
dare
say
the
poor
beast
was
hungry
i
had
a
whole
kilo
of
sausage
and
you
should
have
seen
it
these
look
as
if
they
would
not
be
averse
to
sharing
his
poor
fellows
they
do
look
marcia
produced
her
purse
and
handed
them
a
lira
apiece
because
i
haven
t
any
luggage
for
you
to
carry
and
because
you
like
my
dog
she
explained
in
italian
don
t
tell
uncle
howard
she
added
in
english
i
don
t
believe
one
lira
can
make
them
it
would
doubtless
be
difficult
to
pauperize
them
any
more
than
they
are
at
present
he
agreed
you
don
t
believe
in
uncle
howard
s
ideas
of
charity
do
you
she
inquired
tentatively
oh
not
entirely
but
we
don
t
quarrel
over
he
suggested
we
d
better
go
out
and
find
an
empty
compartment
while
the
guards
are
not
looking
i
fear
they
might
object
to
that
his
name
a
marcellus
because
i
found
him
by
the
hope
he
will
turn
out
as
handsome
a
fellow
as
his
namesake
come
marcellus
it
s
time
we
were
he
picked
the
dog
up
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
they
started
down
the
platform
looking
for
an
empty
carriage
they
had
their
choice
of
a
number
the
train
was
not
crowded
and
carriages
in
an
italian
are
rarely
in
demand
as
he
was
helping
marcia
into
the
car
sybert
was
amused
to
see
tarquinio
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
of
the
italian
people
hurrying
into
a
compartment
with
a
furtive
glance
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
expected
every
corner
to
be
an
ambuscade
of
the
secret
police
the
warning
had
evidently
fallen
on
good
ground
and
the
poor
fellow
was
fleeing
for
his
life
from
the
wicked
machinations
of
an
omniscient
premier
if
you
will
excuse
me
a
moment
i
wish
to
speak
to
a
friend
sybert
said
as
he
got
marcia
settled
and
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
strode
off
down
the
platform
she
had
seen
the
young
italian
weighed
down
by
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
give
a
glance
of
recognition
as
he
passed
them
and
as
she
watched
sybert
enter
a
compartment
she
had
not
a
doubt
but
that
the
italian
was
the
friend
he
was
searching
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
with
a
puzzled
frown
why
had
sybert
so
many
queer
friends
in
so
many
queer
places
and
why
need
he
be
so
silent
about
them
chapter
x
sybert
presently
returned
and
dropped
into
the
seat
opposite
marcia
the
guard
slammed
the
door
and
the
train
pulled
slowly
out
into
the
campagna
they
were
both
occupied
with
their
own
thoughts
and
as
neither
found
much
pleasure
in
talking
to
the
other
and
both
knew
it
they
made
little
pretence
at
conversation
marcia
s
excited
mood
had
passed
and
she
leaned
forward
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
watching
rather
pensively
the
soft
roman
twilight
as
it
crept
over
the
campagna
what
she
really
saw
however
was
the
sunlit
cloister
of
paul
without
the
walls
and
paul
dessart
s
face
as
he
talked
to
her
was
she
really
in
love
with
him
she
asked
herself
or
was
it
she
did
not
know
and
she
did
not
want
to
think
it
was
so
much
pleasanter
merely
to
drift
and
so
very
difficult
to
make
up
one
s
mind
everything
had
been
so
before
why
must
he
bring
the
question
to
an
issue
it
was
a
question
she
did
not
wish
to
decide
for
a
long
long
time
would
he
be
willing
to
wait
for
an
indefinite
future
that
in
the
end
might
never
come
patience
was
not
paul
s
way
suppose
he
refused
to
drift
suppose
he
insisted
on
his
answer
she
wish
to
give
him
up
no
quite
frankly
she
did
not
she
pictured
him
as
he
stood
there
in
the
cloister
with
the
warm
sunlight
and
shadow
playing
about
him
with
his
laughing
boyish
face
for
the
instant
sober
his
eager
insistent
eyes
bent
upon
her
his
words
for
once
stammering
and
halting
he
was
very
attractive
very
convincing
and
yet
she
sighed
life
for
her
was
still
in
the
future
the
world
was
new
and
full
and
varied
and
experience
was
beckoning
there
were
many
things
to
see
and
do
and
she
wanted
to
be
free
the
short
southern
twilight
faded
quickly
and
a
full
moon
took
its
place
in
a
cloudless
turquoise
sky
the
light
flooded
the
dim
compartment
with
a
shimmering
brilliancy
and
outside
it
was
almost
dazzling
in
its
glowing
whiteness
marcia
leaned
against
the
window
gazing
out
at
the
rolling
plain
the
tall
arches
of
aqua
felice
were
silhouetted
darkly
against
the
sky
and
in
the
distance
the
horizon
was
broken
by
the
misty
outline
of
the
sabine
hills
now
and
then
they
passed
a
lonely
group
of
set
in
a
cluster
of
eucalyptus
trees
planted
against
the
fever
but
for
the
most
part
the
scene
was
barren
and
desolate
with
scarcely
a
suggestion
of
actual
breathing
human
light
on
the
appian
way
were
visible
the
gaunt
outlines
of
latin
tombs
and
occasionally
the
ruined
remains
of
a
mediaeval
the
picture
was
almost
too
perfect
in
its
beauty
it
was
like
the
painted
back
drop
for
a
spectacular
play
scarcely
real
and
yet
one
of
the
oldest
things
in
the
rolling
campagna
the
arches
of
the
aqueducts
rome
behind
and
the
sabines
before
so
it
had
been
for
centuries
thousands
of
human
lives
were
wrapped
up
in
it
that
was
its
charm
the
picture
was
not
inanimate
but
pathetically
human
as
she
looked
far
off
across
the
plain
so
mournfully
beautiful
in
its
desolation
a
sudden
rush
of
feeling
swept
over
her
a
rush
of
that
insane
love
of
italy
which
has
engulfed
so
many
foreigners
in
the
waters
of
lethe
she
knew
now
how
paul
felt
italy
italy
she
loved
it
too
a
rose
in
her
throat
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
caught
herself
quickly
and
shrank
back
in
the
corner
with
a
glance
at
the
man
across
to
see
if
he
were
watching
her
he
was
not
he
sat
rigid
looking
out
at
the
campagna
under
eyelids
one
hand
was
plunged
deep
in
his
pocket
and
the
other
lay
on
the
dog
s
head
to
keep
him
quiet
marcia
noticed
in
surprise
that
while
he
appeared
so
calm
his
fingers
opened
and
shut
nervously
she
glanced
up
into
his
face
again
he
was
staring
at
the
picture
before
him
as
impassively
as
at
a
blank
wall
but
his
eyes
seemed
more
than
usual
and
the
under
shadows
darker
she
half
abstractedly
fell
to
studying
his
face
wondering
what
was
behind
those
eyes
what
he
could
be
thinking
of
he
suddenly
looked
up
and
caught
her
gaze
i
beg
your
pardon
he
asked
i
didn
t
say
you
looked
as
if
you
did
he
said
with
a
slight
laugh
and
turned
away
from
the
light
and
now
marcia
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
from
under
his
drooping
lids
he
was
watching
her
she
turned
back
to
the
window
again
and
tried
to
centre
her
attention
on
the
shifting
scene
outside
but
she
was
oppressively
conscious
of
her
silent
companion
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
and
she
could
not
tell
whether
his
eyes
were
open
or
shut
she
tried
to
think
of
something
to
talk
about
but
no
relevant
subject
presented
itself
she
experienced
a
nervous
sense
of
relief
when
the
train
finally
stopped
at
palestrina
the
after
some
delay
found
them
a
carriage
with
a
reasonably
horse
as
sybert
helped
marcia
in
he
asked
if
she
would
object
to
letting
a
poor
fellow
with
an
unbeautifully
large
bundle
sit
on
the
front
seat
with
the
driver
we
won
t
meet
any
one
at
this
time
of
night
he
added
he
s
going
to
castel
vivalanti
and
it
s
a
long
certainly
he
may
ride
marcia
returned
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
we
meet
any
one
or
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
sybert
smiled
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
disagreeable
some
ladies
would
object
you
know
tarquinio
he
called
as
the
italian
with
the
shuffled
past
the
signorina
invites
you
to
ride
since
we
are
going
the
same
tarquinio
thanked
the
signorina
with
italian
courtesy
boosted
up
his
bundle
and
climbed
up
after
it
marcellus
stretched
himself
comfortably
in
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
and
with
a
canine
sigh
of
content
went
peaceably
to
sleep
they
set
out
between
moonlit
olive
orchards
and
vineyards
with
the
familiar
daytime
details
of
and
ruins
softened
into
a
romantic
beauty
behind
them
stretched
the
outline
of
the
alban
mountains
the
moonlight
catching
the
white
walls
of
two
twin
villages
which
crowned
the
heights
and
before
them
rose
the
more
desolate
sabines
standing
fold
upon
fold
against
the
sky
it
was
for
the
most
part
a
silent
drive
sybert
at
first
aware
that
he
was
more
silent
than
politeness
permitted
made
a
few
casual
attempts
at
conversation
and
then
with
an
apparently
easy
conscience
folded
his
arms
and
returned
to
his
thoughts
marcia
too
had
her
thoughts
and
the
romance
of
the
moonlit
night
gave
them
their
direction
had
paul
been
there
to
urge
his
case
anew
italy
would
have
helped
in
the
pleading
but
paul
had
made
a
tiny
mistake
that
had
taken
her
at
her
word
and
let
her
go
the
tiniest
of
mistakes
is
often
big
with
consequences
once
sybert
shifted
his
position
and
his
hand
accidentally
touched
marcia
s
on
the
seat
between
them
pardon
me
he
murmured
and
folded
his
arms
again
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
the
touch
had
run
through
her
like
an
electric
shock
who
was
this
man
she
asked
herself
suddenly
what
was
he
underneath
he
seemed
to
be
burning
up
inside
and
she
had
always
considered
him
apathetic
indifferent
she
looked
at
him
she
had
never
seen
him
like
this
he
reminded
her
of
a
suppressed
volcano
that
would
burst
out
some
day
with
a
sudden
explosion
she
again
set
herself
covertly
to
studying
his
face
his
character
seemed
an
anomaly
it
contradicted
itself
was
it
good
or
bad
simple
or
complex
marcia
did
not
have
the
key
she
put
together
all
the
things
she
knew
of
him
all
the
things
she
had
result
was
largely
negative
the
different
pieces
of
evil
cancelled
each
other
she
knew
him
in
was
several
different
persons
there
but
what
was
he
when
not
in
society
in
his
off
hours
this
afternoon
for
example
why
should
he
be
so
at
home
by
the
theatre
of
marcellus
it
was
a
long
distance
from
the
embassy
and
the
man
on
the
front
seat
who
was
he
she
suddenly
interrupted
the
silence
with
a
question
sybert
started
at
if
he
had
forgotten
she
were
there
she
repeated
it
is
that
man
on
the
front
seat
tarquinio
paterno
who
keeps
a
little
in
rome
yes
he
returned
bringing
a
somewhat
surprised
gaze
to
rest
upon
her
how
do
you
come
to
know
his
name
oh
i
just
guessed
i
know
domenico
paterno
the
castel
vivalanti
baker
and
he
told
me
about
his
son
tarquinio
it
s
not
such
a
very
common
name
so
when
you
said
this
man
was
going
to
the
village
and
when
i
heard
you
call
him
tarquinio
i
were
you
surprised
she
broke
off
is
there
anything
more
to
know
about
him
you
seem
to
have
his
family
history
pretty
straight
sybert
shrugged
they
lapsed
into
silence
again
and
marcia
did
not
attempt
to
break
it
a
second
time
when
they
came
to
the
turning
where
the
steep
road
to
castel
vivalanti
branches
off
from
the
highway
the
driver
halted
to
let
tarquinio
get
out
but
marcia
remonstrated
that
the
bundle
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
carry
up
the
hill
and
she
told
the
man
to
drive
on
up
to
the
gates
of
the
town
they
jogged
on
up
the
winding
ascent
between
orchards
of
olive
and
almond
trees
fringed
with
the
airy
leafage
of
spring
above
them
the
clustering
houses
of
the
village
clung
to
the
hilltop
tier
above
tier
the
jagged
of
roofs
and
towers
cut
out
clearly
against
the
light
marcia
had
never
visited
castel
vivalanti
except
in
the
unequivocal
glare
of
day
which
shows
the
dilapidated
little
town
in
all
its
dilapidation
but
the
moonlight
changes
all
the
grey
stone
walls
stretched
above
them
now
like
some
grim
fortress
city
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
old
round
tower
with
its
ruined
drawbridge
looked
as
if
it
had
seen
dark
deeds
and
kept
the
secret
it
was
just
such
a
stronghold
as
the
cenci
was
murdered
in
they
came
to
a
stand
before
the
tall
arch
of
the
porta
della
luna
while
tarquinio
was
climbing
down
and
hoisting
the
bundle
to
his
shoulder
marcia
s
attention
was
momentarily
attracted
to
a
group
of
boys
quarrelling
over
a
game
of
morro
in
the
gateway
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
tarquinio
s
expressions
of
thanks
to
the
signorina
for
helping
a
poor
man
on
his
journey
a
frightened
shriek
rang
out
in
a
child
s
high
voice
followed
by
a
succession
of
screams
the
stopped
their
game
and
looked
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
and
then
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
went
on
with
the
play
at
the
first
cry
sybert
had
leaped
from
the
carriage
and
seizing
one
of
the
boys
by
the
shoulder
he
demanded
the
cause
the
boy
wriggled
himself
free
with
a
gesture
of
unconcern
gervasio
delano
s
mother
is
beating
him
he
always
makes
a
great
fuss
because
he
is
what
is
it
marcia
cried
as
she
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
ran
up
to
sybert
some
child
s
mother
is
beating
the
two
without
waiting
for
any
further
explanations
turned
in
under
the
gate
and
hurried
along
the
narrow
way
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
people
had
gathered
in
little
groups
in
the
doorways
and
were
shaking
their
heads
and
talking
excitedly
one
woman
as
she
caught
sight
of
marcia
and
sybert
called
out
reassuringly
that
teresa
wasn
t
hurting
the
boy
he
always
cried
harder
than
he
was
struck
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
low
doorway
whence
the
sounds
issued
the
screams
had
died
down
to
hysterical
sobs
they
plunged
into
the
room
which
opened
from
the
street
and
then
paused
it
was
so
dark
that
for
a
moment
they
could
not
see
anything
the
only
light
came
from
a
flickering
burning
before
an
image
of
the
madonna
but
as
their
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
they
made
out
a
stoutly
built
peasant
woman
standing
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
grasping
in
her
hand
an
such
as
the
herdsmen
on
the
campagna
use
for
a
moment
they
thought
she
was
the
only
person
there
until
a
low
sob
proclaimed
the
presence
of
a
child
who
was
crouching
in
the
farthest
corner
what
do
you
want
the
woman
asked
scowling
angrily
at
the
intruders
have
you
been
striking
the
child
with
that
goad
sybert
demanded
i
strike
the
child
with
what
i
please
the
woman
retorted
he
is
a
lazy
and
he
stole
the
marcia
drew
the
little
fellow
from
the
corner
where
he
was
sobbing
steadily
with
long
catches
in
his
breath
his
tears
had
gained
such
a
momentum
that
he
could
not
stop
but
he
clung
to
her
convulsively
realizing
that
a
deliverer
of
some
sort
was
at
hand
she
turned
him
to
the
light
and
revealed
a
great
red
welt
across
his
cheek
where
one
of
the
blows
had
chanced
to
fall
it
s
outrageous
the
woman
ought
to
be
arrested
said
marcia
angrily
sybert
took
the
lamp
from
the
wall
and
bent
over
to
look
at
him
poor
little
devil
he
looks
as
if
he
needed
soup
he
muttered
the
woman
broke
in
shrilly
again
to
say
that
he
was
eleven
years
old
and
never
brought
in
a
single
soldo
she
slaved
night
and
day
to
keep
him
fed
and
she
had
children
enough
of
her
own
to
give
to
whose
child
is
he
sybert
demanded
he
was
my
husband
s
the
woman
returned
and
that
husband
is
dead
and
i
have
a
new
one
the
boy
is
in
the
way
i
can
t
be
expected
to
support
him
forever
it
is
time
he
was
earning
something
for
marcia
sat
down
on
a
low
stool
and
drew
the
boy
to
her
what
can
we
do
she
asked
looking
helplessly
at
sybert
it
won
t
do
to
leave
him
here
she
would
simply
beat
him
to
death
as
soon
as
our
backs
are
i
m
afraid
she
would
he
acknowledged
of
course
i
can
threaten
her
with
the
police
but
i
don
t
believe
it
will
do
much
he
was
thinking
that
she
might
better
adopt
the
boy
than
the
dog
but
he
did
not
care
to
put
his
thoughts
into
words
i
know
she
exclaimed
as
if
in
answer
to
his
unspoken
suggestion
i
ll
take
him
home
for
an
he
will
be
very
useful
about
the
place
tell
the
woman
please
that
i
m
going
to
keep
him
and
make
her
understand
that
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
any
would
copley
like
to
have
him
at
the
villa
sybert
inquired
doubtfully
it
s
hardly
oh
yes
she
won
t
mind
if
i
i
shall
insist
tell
the
woman
sybert
told
the
woman
rather
curtly
that
she
need
not
be
at
the
expense
of
feeding
the
boy
any
longer
the
signorina
would
take
him
home
to
run
errands
the
woman
quickly
changed
her
manner
at
this
and
refused
to
part
with
him
since
she
had
cared
for
him
when
he
was
little
it
was
time
for
him
to
repay
the
debt
now
that
she
was
growing
old
sybert
succinctly
explained
that
she
had
forfeited
all
right
to
the
child
and
that
if
she
made
any
trouble
he
would
tell
the
police
who
he
added
parenthetically
were
his
dearest
friends
without
further
parleying
he
picked
up
the
boy
and
they
walked
out
of
the
house
followed
on
the
woman
s
part
by
angry
prayers
that
apoplexies
might
fall
upon
them
and
their
descendants
curious
groups
of
people
had
gathered
outside
the
house
and
they
separated
silently
to
let
them
pass
at
the
gateway
the
stopped
their
game
to
crowd
around
the
carriage
with
shrill
inquiries
as
to
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
gervasio
the
driver
leaned
from
his
seat
and
stared
in
stupid
bewilderment
at
this
rapid
change
of
fares
but
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
started
with
dispatch
apparently
moved
by
the
belief
that
if
he
gave
them
time
enough
they
would
invite
all
castel
vivalanti
to
drive
as
they
rattled
down
the
hill
sybert
broke
out
into
an
amused
laugh
i
fear
your
aunt
won
t
thank
us
miss
marcia
for
turning
villa
vivalanti
into
a
she
won
t
care
when
we
tell
her
about
it
said
marcia
comfortably
she
glanced
down
at
the
thin
little
face
resting
on
sybert
s
shoulder
poor
little
fellow
he
looks
hungrier
than
marcellus
the
woman
said
he
was
eleven
and
he
s
scarcely
bigger
than
sybert
closed
his
fingers
around
gervasio
s
tiny
brown
wrist
he
s
pretty
thin
he
remarked
but
that
can
soon
be
remedied
these
peasant
children
are
hardy
little
things
when
they
have
half
a
he
looked
down
at
the
boy
who
was
watching
their
faces
with
excited
eyes
half
frightened
at
the
strange
language
you
mustn
t
be
afraid
gervasio
he
reassured
him
in
italian
the
signorina
is
taking
you
home
with
her
to
villa
vivalanti
where
you
won
t
be
whipped
any
more
and
will
have
all
you
want
to
eat
you
must
be
a
good
boy
and
do
everything
she
tells
gervasio
s
eyes
opened
still
wider
will
the
signorina
give
me
chocolate
he
asked
he
s
one
of
the
children
i
gave
chocolate
to
and
he
remembers
it
marcia
said
delightedly
i
thought
his
face
was
familiar
yes
gervasio
she
added
in
her
very
careful
italian
i
will
give
you
chocolate
if
you
always
do
what
you
are
told
but
not
every
day
because
chocolate
is
not
good
for
little
boys
you
must
eat
bread
and
meat
and
soup
and
grow
big
and
strong
signor
siberti
sybert
laughed
and
marcia
joined
him
i
begin
to
appreciate
aunt
katherine
s
anxiety
for
you
suppose
there
is
any
danger
of
malaria
at
villa
vivalanti
for
the
rest
of
the
drive
they
chatted
quite
gaily
over
the
adventure
sybert
for
the
time
dismissed
whatever
he
had
on
his
mind
and
as
for
paul
s
cloisters
were
behind
in
rome
as
they
turned
into
the
avenue
the
lights
of
the
villa
gleamed
brightly
through
the
trees
see
gervasio
said
sybert
that
is
where
you
are
going
to
gervasio
nodded
too
awed
to
speak
presently
he
whispered
shall
i
see
the
little
the
little
what
does
he
mean
marcia
asked
the
little
principino
with
yellow
hair
gervasio
repeated
gerald
sybert
laughed
the
is
good
for
a
american
here
is
the
old
prince
he
added
as
the
carriage
wheels
grated
on
the
gravel
before
the
loggia
and
copley
stepped
out
from
the
hall
to
see
who
had
come
hello
is
that
you
sybert
he
called
out
in
surprise
and
marcia
i
thought
you
had
decided
to
stay
in
in
the
deuce
have
you
brought
with
you
a
boy
and
a
dog
o
prince
said
sybert
as
he
set
gervasio
on
his
feet
miss
marcia
must
plead
guilty
to
the
dog
but
i
will
take
half
the
blame
for
the
gervasio
and
marcellus
were
conveyed
into
the
hall
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
more
frightened
of
the
two
marcellus
slunk
under
a
chair
and
whined
at
the
lights
and
gervasio
looked
after
him
as
if
he
were
tempted
to
follow
copley
attracted
by
the
disturbance
appeared
from
the
salon
and
a
medley
of
questions
and
explanations
ensued
gervasio
meanwhile
sat
up
very
straight
and
very
scared
clutching
the
arms
of
the
big
carved
chair
in
which
sybert
had
placed
him
we
thought
he
might
be
useful
to
run
errands
sybert
suggested
as
they
finished
the
account
of
the
boy
s
maltreatment
poor
child
said
copley
we
can
find
something
for
him
to
do
he
is
small
but
he
looks
intelligent
i
have
always
intended
to
have
a
little
he
might
even
do
as
a
tiger
for
gerald
s
no
aunt
katherine
expostulated
marcia
i
shan
t
have
him
dressed
in
livery
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
to
turn
him
into
a
servant
before
he
s
old
enough
to
the
position
of
a
trained
servant
is
a
much
higher
one
than
he
would
ever
fill
if
left
to
himself
he
is
only
a
peasant
child
my
he
is
a
psychological
problem
she
declared
i
am
going
to
prove
that
environment
is
everything
and
heredity
s
nothing
and
i
shan
t
have
him
dressed
in
livery
i
found
him
and
he
s
least
half
she
glanced
across
at
sybert
and
he
nodded
approval
i
will
turn
my
share
of
the
authority
over
to
you
miss
marcia
since
it
appears
to
be
in
such
good
marcia
shall
have
her
way
said
copley
we
ll
let
gervasio
be
an
unofficial
page
and
postpone
the
question
of
livery
for
the
he
can
play
with
gerald
she
suggested
we
were
wishing
the
other
night
that
he
had
some
one
to
play
with
and
gervasio
will
be
just
the
person
it
will
be
good
for
his
i
suspect
that
gervasio
s
italian
may
not
be
useful
for
purposes
her
uncle
laughed
i
shall
send
him
to
college
she
added
her
mind
running
ahead
of
present
difficulties
and
prove
that
peasants
are
really
as
bright
as
princes
if
they
have
the
same
chance
he
ll
turn
out
a
genius
heaven
forbid
exclaimed
sybert
but
he
examined
marcia
with
a
new
interest
in

on
the
young

career
later

suggested
he
seems
to
be
embarrassed
by
these
gervasio
with
all
these
august
eyes
upon
him
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
into
one
of
his
wails
when
copley
fortunately
diverted
the
attention
by
inquiring
if
they
had
dined
neither
sybert
nor
i
have
had
any
dinner
marcia
returned
and
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
gervasio
has
missed
several
but
marcellus
under
the
chair
there
has
had
his

added
copley
recalling
her
duties
as
hostess
a
jangling
of
bells
ensued
pietro
appeared
and
stared
at
gervasio
with
as
much
astonishment
as
is
compatible
with
the
office
of
butler
copley
ordered
dinner
for
two
in
the
and
for
one
in
the
kitchen
and
turned
the
boy
over
to
pietro
s
care
oh
let
s
have
him
eat
with
us
just
for
marcia
pleaded
you
don
t
mind
do
you
sybert
he
s
so
hungry
i
love
to
watch
hungry
little
boys
marcia
expostulated
her
aunt
in
disgust
how
can
you
say
such
things
the
child
is
since
my
own
son
and
heir
is
banished
from
the

an
unwashed
alien

taking

place
copley
put
in
gervasio
will
dine
with
the
to
gervasio
s
infinite
relief
he
was
led
off
to
the
kitchen
and
consigned
to
the
care
of
françois
who
later
in
the
evening
confided
to
pietro
that
he
didn
t
believe
the
boy
had
ever
eaten
before
marcia
s
and
sybert
s
dinner
that
night
was
an
erratic
affair
and
quite
upset
the
traditions
of
the
copley
ménage
to
pietro
s
scandalization
the
two
followed
him
into
the
kitchen
between
every
course
to
see
how
their
protégé
was
progressing
gervasio
sat
perched
on
a
stool
before
the
long
kitchen
table
his
little
bare
feet
dangling
in
space
an
ample
towel
about
his
neck
while
an
interested
plied
him
with
viands
he
would
have
none
of
the
strange
dishes
that
were
set
before
him
but
with
an
expression
of
settled
purpose
on
his
face
was
steadily
eating
his
way
through
a
bowl
of
macaroni
it
was
with
a
sigh
that
he
had
finally
to
acknowledge
himself
beaten
by
the
copley
larder
marcia
called
bianca
marietta
s
successor
and
bade
her
give
gervasio
a
bath
and
a
bed
bianca
had
known
the
boy
in
his
days
and
if
anything
was
more
than
pietro
on
his
sudden
promotion
as
marcia
was
starting
upstairs
that
night
sybert
strolled
across
the
hall
toward
her
and
held
out
his
hand
how
would
it
be
if
we
declared
an
amnesty
he
at
least
until
gervasio
is
fairly
started
in
his
career
she
glanced
up
in
his
face
a
second
surprised
and
then
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
scepticism
we
can
try
she
smiled
but
i
am
afraid
we
were
meant
to
be
her
room
was
flooded
with
moonlight
she
undressed
without
lighting
her
candle
and
slipping
on
a
light
woollen
kimono
sat
down
on
a
cushion
beside
the
open
window
she
was
too
excited
and
restless
to
sleep
she
leaned
her
chin
on
her
hand
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
low
and
let
the
cool
breeze
fan
her
face
after
a
time
she
heard
some
one
strike
a
match
on
the
loggia
and
her
uncle
and
sybert
came
out
to
the
terrace
and
paced
back
and
forth
talking
in
low
tones
she
could
hear
the
rise
and
fall
of
their
voices
and
every
now
and
then
the
breeze
wafted
in
the
smell
of
their
cigars
she
grew
wider
and
wider
awake
and
followed
them
with
her
eyes
as
they
passed
and
repassed
in
their
tireless
tramp
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
their
voices
sank
to
a
low
murmur
and
then
by
the
loggia
they
rose
again
until
she
could
hear
broken
sentences
sybert
s
voice
sounded
angry
excited
almost
fierce
she
thought
her
uncle
s
low
decisive
half
contemptuous
once
as
they
passed
under
the
window
she
heard
her
uncle
say
sharply
don
t
be
a
fool
sybert
it
will
make
a
nasty
story
if
it
gets
nothing
s
she
did
not
hear
sybert
s
reply
but
she
saw
his
angry
gesture
as
he
flung
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
the
men
paused
by
the
farther
end
of
the
terrace
and
stood
for
several
minutes
arguing
in
lowered
tones
then
to
marcia
s
amazement
sybert
leaped
the
low
parapet
by
the
ilex
grove
and
struck
out
across
the
fields
while
her
uncle
came
back
across
the
terrace
alone
entered
the
house
and
closed
the
door
she
sat
up
straight
with
a
quickly
beating
heart
what
was
the
matter
could
they
have
quarrelled
was
sybert
going
to
the
station
surely
he
would
not
walk
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
looked
after
him
a
black
speck
in
the
moonlit
no
he
was
going
toward
castel
vivalanti
why
castel
vivalanti
at
this
time
of
the
night
had
it
anything
to
do
with
gervasio
perhaps
tarquinio
the
baker
s
son
she
recalled
her
uncle
s
words
don
t
be
a
fool
it
will
make
a
nasty
story
if
it
gets
perhaps
people
s
suspicions
against
him
were
true
after
all
she
thought
of
his
look
that
night
in
the
train
what
was
behind
it
and
then
she
thought
of
the
picture
of
him
in
the
carriage
with
the
little
boy
in
his
arms
a
man
who
was
so
kind
to
children
could
not
be
bad
at
heart
and
yet
if
he
were
all
that
her
uncle
had
thought
him
why
did
he
have
so
many
so
many
doubtful
friends
the
breeze
had
grown
cold
and
she
rose
with
a
quick
shiver
and
went
to
bed
she
lay
a
long
time
with
eyes
watching
the
muslin
curtains
sway
in
the
wind
she
thought
again
of
paul
dessart
s
words
in
the
warm
sleepy
sunlit
cloister
of
the
little
crowd
of
ragamuffins
chasing
the
dog
of
her
long
silent
ride
with
sybert
of
the
moonlit
gateway
of
castel
vivalanti
with
the
dark
high
walls
towering
above
her
thoughts
were
growing
hazy
and
she
was
almost
asleep
when
mingled
with
a
dream
she
heard
footsteps
cross
the
terrace
and
the
hall
door
open
softly
chapter
xi
marcia
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
bianca
knocking
at
the
door
with
the
information
that
gervasio
wished
to
get
up
and
that
as
his
clothes
were
very
ragged
she
had
taken
the
liberty
the
night
before
of
throwing
them
away
for
an
instant
marcia
blinked
uncomprehendingly
then
as
the
events
of
the
evening
flashed
through
her
mind
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
solicitously
clasping
her
knees
in
her
hands
considered
the
problem
she
felt
and
not
without
reason
that
gervasio
s
future
success
at
the
villa
depended
largely
on
the
impression
he
made
at
this
his
first
formal
appearance
she
finally
dispatched
bianca
to
try
him
with
one
of
gerald
s
suits
and
to
be
very
sure
that
his
face
was
clean
meanwhile
she
hurried
through
with
her
own
dressing
in
order
to
be
the
first
to
inspect
his
rehabilitation
as
she
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
her
hair
she
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
on
the
terrace
and
peering
out
cautiously
beheld
her
uncle
and
sybert
lounging
on
the
parapet
engaged
with
cigarettes
she
had
not
been
dreaming
then
those
were
sybert
s
steps
she
had
heard
the
night
before
she
puckered
her
brow
over
the
puzzle
and
peered
out
again
whatever
had
happened
last
night
there
was
nothing
electrical
in
the
air
this
morning
the
two
had
apparently
shoved
all
inflammable
subjects
behind
them
and
were
merely
waiting
idly
until
coffee
should
be
served
it
was
a
beautifully
peaceful
spring
morning
that
she
looked
out
upon
the
two
men
on
the
terrace
appeared
to
be
in
mood
with
the
indifferent
loungers
nothing
more
and
last
night
she
recalled
their
low
fierce
angry
tones
and
the
lines
in
her
forehead
deepened
this
was
a
chameleon
world
she
thought
as
she
stood
watching
them
gervasio
for
the
moment
forgotten
gerald
ran
up
to
the
two
with
some
childish
prattle
which
called
forth
a
quick
amused
laugh
sybert
stretched
out
a
lazy
hand
and
drew
the
boy
toward
him
carefully
balancing
his
cigarette
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
vases
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
tossed
the
little
fellow
in
the
air
four
or
five
times
gerald
screamed
with
delight
and
called
for
more
sybert
laughingly
declined
as
he
resumed
his
cigarette
and
his
seat
on
the
balustrade
the
little
play
recalled
marcia
to
her
duty
with
a
shake
of
her
head
at
matters
in
general
she
gave
them
up
and
turned
her
face
toward
gervasio
s
quarters
bianca
was
on
her
knees
before
the
boy
giving
the
last
touches
to
his
sailor
tie
and
she
turned
him
slowly
around
for
inspection
his
appearance
was
even
more
promising
than
marcia
had
hoped
for
with
his
dark
curls
still
damp
from
their
unwonted
ablutions
clad
in
one
of
gerald
s
baggiest
of
red
linen
with
a
rampant
white
collar
and
tie
except
for
his
bare
feet
which
would
not
be
forced
into
gerald
s
shoes
he
might
have
been
a
little
princeling
himself
backed
by
a
hundred
noble
ancestors
marcia
sank
down
on
her
knees
beside
him
you
little
dear
she
exclaimed
as
she
kissed
him
gervasio
was
not
used
to
caresses
and
for
a
moment
he
drew
back
his
brown
eyes
growing
wide
with
wonder
then
a
smile
broke
over
his
face
and
he
reached
out
a
timid
hand
and
patted
her
confidingly
on
the
cheek
she
kissed
him
again
in
pure
delight
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
set
out
forthwith
for
the
loggia
my
friends
isn
t
he
beautiful
she
demanded
copley
and
sybert
sprang
to
their
feet
and
came
forward
interestedly
who
denies
now
that
it
s
clothes
that
make
the
man
i
can
t
say
but
that
he
was
as
picturesque
last
night
her
uncle
returned
but
he
s
undoubtedly
cleaner
this
where
s
gerald
asked
sybert
let
s
see
what
he
has
to
say
of
the
new
gerald
who
had
but
just
discovered
marcellus
was
delightedly
romping
in
the
garden
with
him
and
was
dragged
away
under
protest
and
confronted
with
the
stranger
he
examined
him
in
silence
a
moment
and
then
remarked
he
s
got
my
cloves
and
suddenly
as
a
terrible
idea
dawned
upon
him
he
burst
out
is
he
a
new
bruvver
cause
if
he
is
you
can
take
him
oh
my
dear
his
mother
remonstrated
in
horror
he
s
a
little
italian
gerald
was
visibly
relieved
he
examined
gervasio
again
from
this
new
point
of
view
i
want
to
go
wifout
my
shoes
and
socks
he
declared
oh
but
he
s
going
to
wear
shoes
and
socks
too
as
soon
we
can
get
some
to
fit
him
said
marcia
do
you
want
to
see
my
lizhyards
gerald
asked
insinuatingly
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
and
pulling
gervasio
by
the
sleeve
gervasio
backed
away
you
must
talk
to
him
in
italian
gerald
sybert
suggested
he
s
like
marietta
he
doesn
t
understand
anything
else
i
should
like
to
have
another
look
at
those
lizards
myself
he
added
come
on
gervasio
and
taking
a
boy
by
each
hand
he
strode
off
toward
the
fountain
mrs
copley
looked
after
them
dubiously
but
marcia
interposed
he
s
a
dear
little
fellow
aunt
katherine
and
it
will
be
good
for
gerald
to
have
some
one
to
play
marcia
s
right
katherine
it
won
t
hurt
him
any
and
i
doubt
if
the
boy
s
italian
is
much
worse
than
bianca
thus
gervasio
s
formal
installation
at
the
villa
for
the
first
week
or
so
his
principal
activity
was
eating
until
he
was
in
the
way
of
becoming
as
as
gerald
himself
during
the
early
stages
of
his
career
he
was
consigned
to
the
kitchen
where
françois
served
him
with
soup
and
macaroni
to
the
point
of
bursting
later
having
learned
to
wield
a
knife
and
fork
without
disaster
he
was
advanced
to
the
nursery
where
he
supped
with
gerald
under
the
watchful
eye
of
granton
taken
all
in
all
gervasio
proved
a
valuable
addition
to
the
household
he
was
eager
to
please
and
pitifully
grateful
for
the
slightest
kindness
he
became
gerald
s
faithful
henchman
and
implicitly
obeyed
his
commands
with
only
an
occasional
rebellion
when
they
were
he
was
quick
to
learn
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
jabbering
in
a
mixture
of
italian
and
english
with
a
vocabulary
nearly
as
varied
as
gerald
s
own
the
first
week
following
gervasio
s
advent
was
a
period
of
comparative
quiet
at
the
villa
but
one
fairly
disturbing
little
contretemps
occurred
to
break
the
monotony
the
boy
had
been
promised
a
reward
of
sweet
chocolate
as
soon
as
he
should
learn
to
wear
shoes
and
stockings
with
a
smiling
and
stockings
being
in
his
eyes
an
objectionable
feature
of
civilization
when
it
came
time
for
payment
however
marcia
discovered
that
there
was
no
sweet
chocolate
in
the
house
and
not
to
disappoint
him
she
ordered
gerald
s
and
taking
with
her
the
two
boys
and
a
groom
set
out
for
castel
vivalanti
and
the
baker
s
had
she
stopped
to
think
she
would
have
known
that
to
take
gervasio
to
castel
vivalanti
in
broad
daylight
was
not
a
wise
proceeding
but
it
was
a
frequent
characteristic
of
the
copleys
that
they
did
their
thinking
afterward
the
spectacle
of
gervasio
delano
in
a
carriage
with
the
and
in
new
clothes
with
his
face
washed
very
nearly
occasioned
a
mob
among
his
former
playmates
the
carriage
was
besieged
and
marcia
found
it
necessary
to
distribute
a
considerable
largess
of
copper
before
she
could
rid
herself
of
her
following
as
she
laughingly
escaped
from
the
crowd
and
drove
out
through
the
gateway
a
man
stepped
forward
from
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
motioned
her
to
stop
for
a
moment
a
remembrance
of
her
aunt
s
with
the
camorrist
flashed
through
her
mind
and
then
she
smiled
as
she
reflected
that
it
was
broad
daylight
and
in
full
sight
of
the
town
she
pulled
the
pony
to
a
standstill
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
he
was
gervasio
s
stepfather
he
said
they
were
poor
people
and
did
not
have
enough
to
eat
but
they
were
very
lonely
without
the
boy
and
wished
to
have
him
back
even
american
princes
he
added
couldn
t
take
poor
people
s
children
away
without
their
permission
and
he
finished
by
insinuating
that
if
he
were
paid
enough
he
might
reconsider
the
matter
marcia
did
not
understand
all
that
he
said
but
as
gervasio
began
to
cry
and
at
the
same
time
clasped
both
hands
firmly
about
the
seat
in
an
evident
determination
to
resist
all
efforts
to
dislodge
him
she
saw
what
he
meant
and
replied
that
she
would
tell
the
police
but
the
man
evidently
thought
that
he
had
the
upper
hand
of
the
situation
and
that
she
would
rather
buy
him
off
than
let
the
boy
go
with
a
threatening
air
he
reached
out
and
grasped
gervasio
roughly
by
the
arm
gervasio
screamed
and
marcia
before
she
thought
of
possible
consequences
struck
the
man
a
sharp
blow
with
the
whip
and
at
the
same
time
lashed
the
pony
into
a
gallop
they
dashed
down
the
stony
road
and
around
the
corners
at
a
perilous
rate
while
the
man
shouted
curses
from
the
top
of
the
hill
they
reached
the
villa
still
bubbling
with
excitement
over
the
adventure
and
caused
copley
no
little
alarm
but
when
marcia
greeted
her
uncle
s
arrival
that
night
with
the
story
he
declared
that
she
had
done
just
right
and
without
waiting
for
dinner
he
remounted
his
horse
and
galloping
back
to
castel
vivalanti
rode
straight
up
to
the
door
of
the
little
where
the
fellow
was
engaged
in
drinking
wine
and
cursing
americans
there
he
told
him
before
an
interested
group
of
witnesses
that
gervasio
was
not
his
child
that
since
he
could
not
treat
him
decently
he
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
him
and
that
if
he
tried
to
levy
any
further
blackmail
he
would
find
himself
in
prison
wherewith
he
wheeled
his
horse
s
head
about
and
made
a
spectacular
exit
from
the
town
if
anything
were
needed
to
strengthen
gervasio
s
position
with
copley
this
incident
answered
the
purpose
as
a
result
of
the
adventure
marcia
for
the
time
dropped
castel
vivalanti
from
her
and
extended
her
acquaintance
in
the
other
direction
she
came
to
be
well
known
as
she
galloped
about
the
on
a
little
sorrel
born
and
bred
in
kentucky
followed
by
a
groom
on
a
thumping
cob
who
always
respectfully
drew
up
behind
her
when
she
stopped
as
often
as
she
could
think
of
any
excuse
she
visited
the
peasants
in
their
houses
laughing
gaily
with
them
over
her
own
queer
grammar
it
was
an
amused
curiosity
which
at
first
actuated
her
friendliness
their
ingenious
comments
and
naïve
questions
in
regard
to
america
proved
an
source
of
interest
but
after
a
little
as
she
understood
them
better
she
grew
to
like
them
for
their
own
stanch
virtues
when
she
looked
about
their
gloomy
little
rooms
with
almost
no
furnishing
except
a
few
copper
pots
and
kettles
and
a
tawdry
picture
of
the
madonna
and
saw
what
meagre
straitened
lives
they
led
and
yet
how
bravely
they
bore
them
her
amusement
changed
to
respect
their
quick
sympathy
and
warm
friendliness
awakened
an
answering
spark
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
had
discovered
for
herself
the
lovable
charm
of
the
italian
peasant
she
explored
in
the
course
of
her
rides
many
a
forgotten
little
mountain
village
topping
a
barren
crag
of
the
sabines
and
held
by
some
roman
prince
in
almost
the
same
feudal
tenure
as
a
thousand
years
ago
they
were
picturesque
enough
from
below
these
huddling
hamlets
shooting
up
from
the
solid
rock
but
when
she
had
climbed
the
steeply
winding
path
and
had
looked
within
she
found
them
miserable
and
desolate
beyond
belief
she
was
coming
to
see
the
under
side
of
a
great
deal
of
picturesqueness
meanwhile
though
life
was
moving
in
an
even
groove
at
villa
vivalanti
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
the
rest
of
italy
each
day
brought
fresh
reports
of
rioting
throughout
the
southern
provinces
and
travellers
hurrying
north
reported
that
every
town
of
any
size
was
under
martial
law
in
spite
of
reassuring
newspaper
articles
written
under
the
eye
of
the
police
it
was
evident
that
affairs
were
fast
approaching
a
crisis
there
was
not
much
anxiety
felt
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
rome
for
the
capital
was
too
great
a
stronghold
of
the
army
to
be
in
actual
danger
from
mobs
the
affair
if
anything
was
regarded
as
a
welcome
diversion
from
the
tediousness
of
lent
and
the
embassies
and
large
hotels
where
the
foreigners
congregated
were
animated
by
a
not
unpleasurable
air
of
excitement
conflicting
opinions
of
every
sort
were
current
some
shook
their
heads
wisely
and
said
that
in
their
opinion
the
matter
was
much
more
serious
than
appeared
on
the
surface
they
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
scenes
of
the
french
commune
enacted
over
again
and
they
intimated
further
that
since
it
had
to
happen
they
were
very
willing
to
be
on
hand
in
time
to
see
the
fun
many
expressed
the
belief
that
the
trouble
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
price
of
bread
the
wheat
famine
was
merely
a
pretext
for
stirring
up
the
people
it
was
well
known
that
the
universities
the
younger
generation
of
writers
and
newspaper
men
even
the
ranks
of
the
army
were
riddled
with
socialism
what
more
likely
than
that
the
socialists
and
the
church
adherents
had
united
to
overthrow
the
government
intending
as
soon
as
their
end
was
accomplished
to
turn
upon
each
other
and
fight
it
out
for
supremacy
it
was
the
opinion
of
these
that
the
government
should
have
adopted
the
most
drastic
measures
possible
and
was
doing
very
foolishly
in
catering
to
the
populace
by
putting
down
the
still
others
held
that
the
government
should
have
abolished
the
long
before
and
that
the
people
in
the
south
did
very
well
to
rise
and
demand
their
rights
and
so
the
affairs
of
the
unfortunate
neapolitans
were
the
subject
of
conversation
at
every
d
in
rome
and
the
sojourning
within
the
walls
derived
a
large
amount
of
entertainment
from
the
matter
marcia
copley
however
had
heard
little
of
the
gathering
trouble
she
did
not
read
the
papers
and
her
uncle
did
not
mention
the
matter
at
home
he
was
too
sick
at
heart
to
dwell
on
it
uselessly
and
it
was
not
a
subject
he
cared
to
discuss
with
his
niece
his
family
indeed
saw
very
little
of
him
for
he
had
thrown
himself
into
the
work
of
the
foreign
relief
committee
with
characteristic
energy
and
he
spent
the
most
of
his
time
in
rome
marcia
s
interest
in
had
come
to
a
sudden
halt
since
the
afternoon
of
tre
fontane
she
had
ventured
into
the
city
only
once
and
then
merely
to
attend
to
the
purchase
of
clothes
for
gervasio
the
roystons
on
that
occasion
had
been
out
when
she
called
at
their
hotel
and
her
feeling
of
regret
was
mingled
largely
with
relief
as
she
left
her
card
and
retired
in
safety
to
villa
vivalanti
she
had
not
analysed
her
emotions
very
thoroughly
but
she
felt
a
decided
trepidation
at
the
thought
of
seeing
paul
the
trepidation
however
was
not
altogether
an
unpleasant
sensation
the
scene
in
the
cloisters
had
returned
to
her
mind
many
times
and
she
had
taken
several
brief
excursions
into
the
future
what
would
he
say
the
next
time
they
met
would
he
renew
the
same
subject
or
would
he
tacitly
overlook
that
afternoon
and
for
the
time
let
everything
be
as
it
had
been
before
she
hoped
that
the
latter
would
be
the
case
it
would
give
a
certain
piquancy
to
their
relations
and
she
was
not
at
make
up
her
mind
paul
on
his
side
had
also
pondered
the
question
somewhat
events
were
not
moving
with
the
rapidity
he
wished
marcia
evidently
would
not
come
into
rome
and
he
could
think
of
no
valid
excuse
for
going
out
to
the
villa
his
pessimistic
forecast
of
events
had
proved
true
holy
week
found
the
roystons
still
in
the
city
treating
themselves
to
orgies
of
as
he
followed
his
aunt
from
church
to
church
there
are
in
the
neighbourhood
of
three
hundred
and
in
rome
and
he
says
they
visited
them
all
that
week
he
indulged
in
many
speculations
as
to
the
state
of
marcia
s
mind
in
regard
to
himself
at
times
he
feared
he
had
been
at
others
that
he
had
not
been
precipitate
enough
his
aunt
and
cousins
returned
from
a
flying
visit
to
the
villa
with
the
report
that
marcia
had
adopted
a
boy
and
a
dog
and
was
solicitously
engaged
with
their
education
what
did
she
say
about
me
madge
paul
boldly
inquired
she
said
you
were
a
very
impudent
fellow
margaret
retorted
and
in
response
to
his
somewhat
startled
expression
she
added
more
magnanimously
you
needn
t
be
so
vain
as
to
think
she
said
anything
about
you
she
never
even
mentioned
your
paul
breathed
a
meditative
ah
marcia
had
not
mentioned
his
name
it
was
not
such
a
bad
sign
that
she
was
thinking
about
him
then
if
there
were
no
other
he
was
vain
enough
to
take
her
at
her
could
be
better
for
his
cause
than
a
solitary
week
in
the
sabine
hills
he
knew
from
that
an
italian
spring
is
a
powerful
stimulant
for
the
heart
on
tuesday
of
holy
week
royston
wakened
slightly
from
her
spiritual
trance
to
observe
that
she
had
scarcely
seen
marcia
for
as
much
as
a
week
and
that
as
soon
as
lent
was
over
they
must
have
the
copleys
in
to
luncheon
at
the
hotel
where
s
the
use
of
waiting
till
lent
s
over
paul
had
inquired
you
needn
t
make
it
a
function
just
a
sort
affair
if
you
invite
them
for
thursday
we
can
all
go
together
to
the
tenebræ
service
at
peter
s
as
this
is
miss
copley
s
first
easter
in
rome
she
might
be
accordingly
a
note
arrived
at
the
villa
on
wednesday
morning
inviting
the
breakfast
the
next
day
with
the
roystons
in
rome
on
thursday
morning
an
at
the
de
lourdres
et
and
was
followed
an
hour
later
by
the
copleys
themselves
the
breakfast
went
off
gaily
paul
was
his
most
expansive
self
and
the
whole
table
responded
to
his
mood
it
was
with
a
sense
of
gratification
that
marcia
saw
her
uncle
who
had
lately
been
so
grave
laughingly
exchanging
nonsense
with
the
young
man
she
felt
though
she
would
scarcely
have
acknowledged
it
to
herself
a
certain
property
right
in
paul
and
it
pleased
her
subtly
when
he
pleased
other
people
she
sat
next
to
him
at
the
table
and
occasionally
beneath
his
laughter
and
persiflage
she
caught
an
undertone
of
meaning
so
long
as
they
were
not
alone
and
he
could
not
go
beyond
a
certain
point
she
found
their
relations
on
a
distinctly
satisfying
basis
in
spite
of
paul
s
manœuvres
he
did
not
find
himself
alone
with
marcia
that
afternoon
there
was
always
a
cousin
in
attendance
and
copley
declining
the
spectacle
of
the
tenebræ
in
peter
had
seen
it
shortly
after
luncheon
as
they
were
leaving
copley
remarked
to
i
will
entrust
my
niece
to
your
care
and
please
do
not
lose
sight
of
her
until
you
put
her
in
my
hands
for
the
evening
train
i
wish
no
more
such
escapades
as
we
had
the
other
and
to
marcia
s
discomfort
the
adventures
involving
the
rescue
of
marcellus
and
gervasio
were
recounted
in
detail
for
an
unexplained
reason
she
would
have
preferred
the
story
of
their
origin
to
remain
in
darkness
paul
s
face
clouded
slightly
my
objections
to
sybert
grow
rapidly
he
remarked
in
an
undertone
marcia
laughed
if
you
could
have
seen
him
he
never
spoke
a
word
to
me
all
the
way
out
in
the
train
he
sat
with
his
arms
folded
and
a
frown
on
his
brow
at
paul
s
face
brightened
again
oh
i
begin
to
like
him
after
all
he
declared
toward
five
o
clock
that
evening
every
carriage
in
the
city
seemed
to
be
bent
for
the
ponte
sant
angelo
a
casual
spectator
would
never
have
chosen
a
religious
function
as
the
end
of
all
this
confusion
in
the
tangle
of
narrow
streets
beyond
the
bridge
the
way
was
almost
blocked
and
such
progress
as
was
possible
was
made
at
a
snail
s
pace
the
royston
party
in
two
carriages
not
unnaturally
lost
each
other
the
carriage
containing
marcia
margaret
and
paul
getting
into
the
jam
in
the
narrow
borgo
nuovo
arrived
in
the
piazza
of
peter
s
with
wheels
locked
with
a
cardinal
s
coach
the
cardinal
s
coachman
and
theirs
exchanged
an
unclerical
opinion
of
each
other
s
ability
as
drivers
the
cardinal
advanced
his
head
from
the
window
with
a
mildly
startled
air
of
reproof
and
the
americans
laughed
gaily
at
the
situation
after
a
moment
of
scrutiny
the
cardinal
smiled
back
and
the
four
disembarked
and
set
out
on
foot
across
the
piazza
leaving
the
men
to
sever
the
difficulty
at
their
leisure
he
proved
an
unexpectedly
cordial
person
and
when
they
parted
on
the
broad
steps
he
held
out
of
his
hand
with
a
friendly
smile
and
after
a
moment
of
perplexed
hesitation
the
three
gravely
shook
it
in
turn
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
kissed
it
marcia
inquired
i
would
have
done
it
only
i
didn
t
know
paul
laughed
he
knew
we
weren
t
of
the
true
faith
no
catholic
would
laugh
at
nearly
spilling
a
cardinal
in
the
they
stood
aside
by
the
central
door
looking
for
royston
and
eleanor
and
watching
the
crowd
surge
past
paul
was
quite
insistent
that
they
should
go
in
without
the
others
but
marcia
was
equally
insistent
that
they
wait
she
had
an
intuitive
feeling
that
there
was
safety
in
numbers
for
a
wonder
they
presently
espied
royston
bearing
down
upon
them
a
small
clutched
to
her
portly
bosom
and
eleanor
panting
along
behind
a
in
either
hand
royston
caught
sight
of
them
with
an
expression
of
relief
my
dears
i
was
afraid
i
had
lost
you
she
gasped
we
remembered
just
as
we
got
to
the
bridge
that
we
hadn
t
brought
any
chairs
and
so
we
went
back
for
them
paul
you
should
have
thought
of
them
yourself
i
suppose
we
d
better
hurry
in
and
get
a
good
paul
patiently
possessed
himself
of
the
chairs
and
followed
the
ladies
with
a
glance
at
marcia
which
seemed
to
say
is
there
this
day
living
a
more
exemplary
nephew
and
gentleman
than
i
the
tenebræ
service
on
holy
thursday
is
the
one
time
in
the
year
when
peter
s
may
be
seen
at
night
the
great
church
looms
vaster
and
emptier
and
more
solemn
then
than
at
any
other
time
the
eye
can
not
penetrate
to
the
distant
dome
hidden
in
shadows
the
long
nave
stretches
interminably
into
space
the
chapels
deepen
and
broaden
until
they
are
churches
themselves
the
clustered
pillars
reach
upward
till
they
are
lost
in
the
darkness
what
the
eye
can
not
grasp
the
imagination
seizes
upon
and
the
vast
interior
grows
and
widens
until
it
seems
to
stretch
out
arms
to
inclose
all
christendom
itself
on
this
one
night
it
does
inclose
all
and
peasants
italians
and
foreigners
those
who
are
of
the
faith
and
those
who
are
merely
spectators
those
who
come
to
worship
those
who
come
to
be
peter
s
receives
them
all
with
the
same
impartiality
standing
outside
it
had
seemed
to
them
that
the
whole
city
had
flowed
through
the
doors
but
within
the
church
was
still
approximately
empty
as
they
walked
down
the
broad
nave
in
the
dimness
of
twilight
marcia
turned
to
the
young
man
beside
her
at
first
i
didn
t
think
peter
s
was
is
compared
to
milan
and
cologne
and
some
of
the
other
it
s
like
the
rest
of
rome
it
grows
and
grows
it
comes
to
be
the
whole
world
he
supplied
by
the
bronze
baldacchino
royston
spread
her
and
sat
down
this
is
the
best
place
we
could
choose
she
said
contentedly
as
she
folded
her
hands
we
shan
t
be
very
near
the
choir
but
we
can
hear
just
as
well
and
we
shall
have
an
excellent
view
of
the
and
the
sacred
she
spoke
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
picking
out
a
stall
for
a
theatrical
performance
from
time
to
time
friends
of
either
the
roystons
or
marcia
drifted
up
and
having
paused
to
chat
a
few
minutes
passed
on
giving
place
to
others
as
one
group
left
them
with
smiles
and
friendly
bows
marcia
turned
to
paul
who
was
standing
beside
her
it
s
really
dreadful
she
said
the
way
the
foreigners
take
possession
of
rome
this
might
as
well
be
a
reception
at
the
embassy
if
i
were
the
pope
i
would
put
up
a
sign
on
the
door
of
peter
s
saying
no
ah
but
there
are
no
in
the
case
of
peter
s
it
belongs
to
all
marcia
smiled
at
the
young
man
and
turned
away
and
as
she
turned
she
caught
across
an
intervening
stream
of
heads
a
face
looking
in
her
direction
wearing
about
the
eyes
a
curiously
quizzical
expression
it
was
the
face
of
a
interesting
exactly
beautiful
but
sparkling
with
intelligence
it
seemed
very
familiar
to
marcia
and
as
her
eyes
lingered
on
it
a
moment
the
quizzical
expression
gave
place
to
one
of
amused
friendliness
the
woman
smiled
and
bowed
and
passed
on
marcia
bowed
vaguely
and
then
it
flashed
through
her
mind
who
it
lady
who
wrote
the
greatest
gossip
in
rome
whom
she
had
met
at
the
studio
tea
so
many
weeks
before
she
had
forgotten
all
about
her
unknown
friend
of
that
day
and
now
she
turned
quickly
to
paul
to
ask
her
identity
paul
was
engaged
in
answering
some
question
of
his
aunt
s
and
before
she
could
gain
his
attention
again
a
hush
swept
over
the
great
interior
and
everything
else
was
forgotten
in
the
opening
chorus
of
the
the
twilight
had
deepened
and
the
great
white
dome
shone
dimly
far
above
the
blackness
of
the
crowd
the
voices
of
the
papal
choir
swelled
louder
and
louder
in
the
solemn
chant
and
high
and
separate
and
alone
rose
the
clear
treble
of
the
pope
s
and
as
an
undertone
an
accompaniment
to
the
music
the
shuffle
and
murmur
of
thirty
thousand
listeners
rose
and
fell
like
the
distant
beat
of
surf
the
candles
on
the
altar
showed
dimly
above
their
heads
as
the
service
continued
one
by
one
the
lights
were
extinguished
after
half
an
hour
or
so
the
waiting
and
intensity
grew
wearing
the
crowd
was
pressing
closer
and
margaret
royston
craned
her
neck
vainly
trying
to
discover
how
many
candles
remained
paul
with
ready
imagination
was
answering
his
aunt
s
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
ceremonies
margaret
turned
to
marcia
poke
this
young
priest
in
front
of
me
she
whispered
and
ask
him
in
italian
how
many
candles
are
the
young
priest
overhearing
the
words
turned
around
with
an
amused
smile
obligingly
stood
on
his
tiptoes
to
look
at
the
altar
and
replied
in
english
that
there
were
three
thank
you
said
margaret
i
didn
t
suppose
you
could
talk
i
was
born
in
troy
new
really
she
laughed
and
the
two
fell
to
comparing
the
rival
merits
of
the
hudson
and
the
tiber
he
proved
most
friendly
carefully
explaining
to
the
party
the
significance
of
the
service
and
the
meaning
of
the
different
symbols
royston
looked
reproachfully
at
her
nephew
whose
stories
it
transpired
did
not
accord
with
fact
you
really
couldn
t
expect
me
to
know
as
much
as
a
professional
aunt
eleanor
he
unblushingly
expostulated
my
explanations
were
more
picturesque
than
his
at
any
rate
and
if
they
aren
t
true
they
ought
to
the
last
candle
was
finally
out
and
for
a
moment
the
great
interior
remained
in
darkness
then
a
noise
like
the
distant
rattle
of
thunder
symbolized
the
rending
of
the
veil
and
in
an
instant
lights
sprang
out
from
every
arch
and
pier
and
dome
a
long
procession
of
cardinals
choristers
and
acolytes
wound
singing
to
the
high
altar
of
the
marcia
stood
by
the
railing
and
watched
their
faces
as
they
filed
past
they
were
such
thoughtful
spiritual
kindly
faces
that
her
respect
for
this
great
greatest
power
in
momentarily
she
felt
a
sort
of
shame
to
be
there
merely
as
a
spectator
she
looked
about
at
the
faces
of
the
peasants
and
thought
what
a
barren
barren
existence
would
be
theirs
without
this
church
which
promised
the
only
joy
they
could
ever
hope
to
have
when
the
ceremony
of
washing
the
altar
with
oil
and
wine
was
ended
the
young
priest
bade
them
a
friendly
good
evening
he
could
not
wait
for
the
holy
relics
he
said
they
had
supper
at
the
monastery
at
seven
o
clock
he
hastily
added
however
in
response
to
the
smile
trembling
on
margaret
s
lips
not
that
they
are
not
the
true
relics
and
very
holy
but
i
have
seen
them
several
times
the
relics
were
exhibited
to
the
multitude
from
veronica
s
balcony
far
above
their
heads
paul
whispered
to
marcia
with
a
little
laugh
our
friend
the
cardinal
would
be
gratified
would
he
not
to
see
his
heretics
bowing
before
veronica
s
handkerchief
look
he
added
at
that
peasant
woman
in
her
blue
skirt
and
scarlet
kerchief
she
has
probably
walked
fifty
miles
with
her
baby
strapped
to
a
board
i
suppose
she
thinks
the
child
will
have
good
fortune
the
rest
of
his
life
if
he
just
catches
a
glimpse
of
a
splinter
of
the
true
marcia
looked
at
the
woman
standing
beside
her
a
pilgrim
from
the
abruzzi
judging
from
her
dress
she
was
raising
an
illumined
face
to
the
little
balcony
where
the
priest
was
holding
above
their
heads
the
holy
relic
in
her
arms
she
held
a
baby
whose
face
she
was
turning
upward
also
while
she
murmured
prayers
in
his
ears
marcia
s
glance
wandered
away
over
the
poor
pilgrim
peasants
whose
upturned
faces
worn
by
work
and
poverty
were
softened
for
the
moment
into
a
holy
awe
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
balcony
where
the
priest
in
his
white
robes
was
holding
high
above
his
head
the
shining
silver
cross
in
which
was
incased
peter
s
dearest
relic
the
tiny
splinter
of
the
true
cross
the
light
was
centred
on
the
little
balcony
every
eye
in
the
great
concourse
was
fixed
upon
it
the
priest
was
fat
his
face
was
red
his
attitude
theatrical
the
whole
spectacle
was
theatrical
a
quick
revulsion
of
feeling
passed
over
her
a
few
moments
before
as
she
watched
the
procession
of
cardinals
she
had
been
ready
to
admit
the
spiritual
significance
of
the
scene
now
she
saw
only
its
spectacular
side
it
was
merely
a
play
a
delusion
got
up
to
dazzle
the
poor
peasants
this
church
was
the
only
thing
they
had
in
life
and
after
all
what
did
it
do
for
them
what
could
veronica
s
handkerchief
what
could
a
splinter
of
the
true
cross
do
to
brighten
their
lives
it
was
superstition
not
religion
that
was
being
offered
to
the
peasants
of
italy
she
looked
again
across
the
sea
of
upturned
faces
and
shook
her
head
isn
t
it
pitiful
she
asked
isn
t
it
picturesque
echoed
paul
that
priest
up
there
knows
he
s
deluding
all
these
people
and
he
s
just
as
solemn
as
if
he
believed
in
the
relics
himself
the
church
is
still
so
hopelessly
mediaeval
that
s
the
beauty
of
the
church
paul
objected
it
s
still
mediaeval
while
the
rest
of
the
world
is
so
hopelessly
i
like
to
see
these
peasants
believing
in
veronica
s
handkerchief
and
the
power
of
the
sacred
bambino
to
cure
disease
i
think
it
s
a
beautiful
exhibition
of
faith
in
a
world
where
faith
is
out
of
fashion
i
don
t
blame
the
priests
in
the
least
for
keeping
it
up
it
s
a
protest
against
the
age
they
re
about
the
only
artists
left
if
i
were
a
priest
i
d
learn
prestidigitation
and
substantiate
the
efficacy
of
the
relics
with
a
miracle
or
it
s
simply
fostering
take
their
superstition
away
and
you
deprive
them
of
their
most
picturesque
you
don
t
care
for
anything
but
what
s
picturesque
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
half
scornful
paul
did
not
answer
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
crowd
was
beginning
to
pour
out
they
turned
with
the
stream
and
wedged
their
way
toward
the
entrance
near
which
their
carriages
were
waiting
paul
manœuvred
very
adroitly
so
that
the
crowd
should
separate
them
from
the
rest
of
the
party
at
the
door
i
will
tell
you
what
i
care
for
most
he
said
in
her
ear
as
they
pushed
out
into
the
portico
i
care
for
she
perceived
his
drift
too
late
and
looked
back
with
an
air
of
dismay
the
others
were
lost
in
the
moving
mass
of
heads
paul
saw
her
glance
and
laughed
you
re
going
to
take
good
care
that
we
shan
t
be
alone
together
aren
t
you
marcia
echoed
his
laugh
yes
she
acknowledged
frankly
i
m
trying
it
doesn
t
matter
my
time
s
coming
you
can
t
put
it
his
hand
touched
hers
hanging
at
her
side
and
he
clasped
it
firmly
come
here
we
ll
get
out
of
this
crowd
and
he
pushed
on
outside
and
drew
back
into
a
corner
by
one
of
the
tall
columns
the
crowd
surged
past
flowing
down
the
steps
like
a
river
widening
to
the
sea
below
them
the
piazza
was
black
with
a
tossing
moving
mass
of
carriages
and
people
the
mass
of
the
vatican
at
their
left
loomed
a
black
bulk
in
the
night
its
hundreds
of
windows
shining
in
the
reflected
lights
of
the
piazza
like
the
eyes
of
a
great
octopus
at
another
time
marcia
might
have
looked
very
curiously
toward
the
palace
she
might
have
wondered
if
in
one
of
those
dark
windows
leo
was
not
standing
brooding
over
the
throng
of
worshippers
who
had
come
that
day
how
must
a
pope
feel
to
see
thirty
thousand
people
go
out
from
under
his
out
freely
to
their
he
alone
may
not
step
across
the
threshold
at
another
time
she
would
have
paused
to
play
a
little
with
the
thought
but
now
her
attention
was
engaged
paul
still
held
her
hand
he
squared
himself
in
front
of
her
with
his
back
to
the
crowd
have
you
been
thinking
about
what
i
asked
you
had
she
been
thinking
she
had
been
doing
nothing
else
she
looked
at
him
reproachfully
let
s
not
talk
about
it
the
more
i
think
the
more
i
don
t
that
s
an
unfortunate
state
to
be
in
perhaps
i
can
help
you
to
make
up
your
mind
are
you
going
to
be
in
love
with
me
some
day
he
persisted
don
t
he
leaned
toward
her
with
his
face
very
close
to
hers
she
shrank
back
further
into
the
shadow
there
they
are
she
exclaimed
as
she
caught
sight
of
eleanor
s
head
above
the
crowd
and
she
tried
to
draw
her
hand
away
never
mind
them
they
won
t
be
here
for
three
minutes
you
ve
got
time
enough
to
answer
please
not
she
whispered
when
he
insisted
keeping
a
firm
hold
of
her
hand
the
next
time
i
see
you
and
she
turned
away
to
greet
the
others
chapter
xii
the
week
following
easter
proved
rainy
and
disagreeable
it
was
not
a
cheerful
period
for
the
villa
turned
out
to
be
a
house
the
stone
walls
seemed
to
absorb
and
retain
the
moisture
like
a
vault
and
a
mortuary
atmosphere
hung
about
the
rooms
copley
with
masculine
imperviousness
to
mud
and
water
succeeded
in
escaping
from
the
dampness
of
his
home
by
journeying
daily
to
the
embassy
but
his
wife
and
niece
more
solicitous
on
the
subject
of
hair
and
clothes
remained
and
on
the
fourth
day
copley
s
conversation
turned
frequently
to
malaria
marcia
who
had
taken
the
villa
for
better
for
worse
steadfastly
endeavoured
to
approve
of
it
in
even
this
uncheerful
mood
she
divided
her
time
between
romping
through
the
big
rooms
with
gerald
gervasio
and
marcellus
and
shivering
over
a
brazier
full
of
coals
in
her
own
room
to
the
accompaniment
of
dripping
ilex
trees
and
the
superfluous
splashing
of
the
fountain
her
book
was
the
and
the
is
an
illuminating
work
to
a
young
woman
in
marcia
s
frame
of
mind
it
makes
her
hesitate
she
knew
that
paul
dessart
in
no
wise
resembled
the
magnificent
sir
willoughby
and
that
it
was
unfair
to
make
the
comparison
but
still
she
made
it
as
she
stood
by
the
window
gazing
down
on
the
campagna
she
pondered
the
situation
and
pondered
it
again
and
succeeded
only
in
working
herself
into
a
state
of
deeper
indecision
paul
was
interesting
her
uncle
said
decorative
but
was
he
any
more
or
was
that
enough
should
she
be
sorry
if
she
said
no
should
she
be
sorrier
if
she
said
yes
so
her
mind
busied
itself
to
the
dripping
of
the
raindrops
and
for
all
the
thought
she
spent
upon
the
question
she
wandered
in
a
circle
and
finished
where
she
had
started
the
monday
following
easter
week
dawned
clear
and
bright
again
marcia
opened
her
eyes
to
a
bar
of
sunlight
streaming
in
at
the
eastern
window
and
the
first
sound
that
greeted
her
was
a
joyful
chorus
of
she
sat
up
and
viewed
the
weather
with
a
sense
of
life
feeling
as
if
her
perplexities
had
somehow
vanished
with
the
rain
she
was
no
nearer
making
up
her
mind
than
she
had
been
the
day
before
but
she
was
quite
contented
to
let
it
stay
unmade
a
little
longer
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
beneath
her
window
told
her
that
her
uncle
had
started
for
the
station
when
he
was
away
and
there
were
no
guests
in
the
house
marcia
and
copley
usually
had
the
first
breakfast
served
in
their
rooms
accordingly
as
she
heard
her
uncle
gallop
off
she
made
a
leisurely
toilet
and
then
ate
her
coffee
and
rolls
and
marmalade
at
a
little
table
set
on
the
balcony
it
was
late
when
she
joined
her
aunt
on
the
loggia
copley
looked
up
from
an
intricate
piece
of
embroidery
good
morning
marcia
she
said
returning
her
niece
s
greeting
yes
isn
t
it
a
relief
to
see
some
sunshine
again
have
a
surprise
for
you
she
added
a
surprise
asked
marcia
my
birthday
isn
t
coming
for
two
weeks
but
never
mind
surprises
are
always
welcome
what
is
it
it
isn
t
a
very
big
surprise
just
a
tiny
one
to
break
the
monotony
of
these
four
days
of
rain
i
had
a
note
from
royston
this
morning
it
should
have
come
yesterday
only
it
was
so
wet
that
angelo
didn
t
go
for
the
she
paused
to
rummage
through
the
basket
of
silks
i
thought
it
was
here
but
no
matter
she
says
that
owing
to
these
dreadful
riots
they
have
changed
all
their
plans
they
have
entirely
given
up
naples
and
are
going
north
instead
on
a
little
trip
of
a
week
or
so
to
assisi
and
perugia
she
wrote
to
say
and
to
tell
me
that
they
would
get
back
to
rome
in
time
for
your
party
though
they
are
afraid
they
can
t
spend
more
than
two
or
three
days
with
us
then
as
the
change
of
plan
involves
some
hurry
they
leave
on
that
is
too
bad
said
marcia
and
with
the
words
she
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
paul
would
go
with
them
probably
or
at
any
rate
she
need
not
see
him
it
would
postpone
the
difficulty
but
where
is
the
surprise
she
inquired
oh
the
surprise
copley
laughed
i
entirely
forgot
it
i
was
afraid
they
might
think
it
strange
that
i
hadn
t
answered
the
i
really
didn
t
get
it
in
i
asked
your
uncle
to
stop
at
their
hotel
and
invite
them
all
to
come
out
to
the
villa
for
the
night
i
thought
that
since
we
were
planning
to
drive
to
the
festa
at
genazzano
it
would
be
nice
to
have
them
with
us
i
am
sure
they
would
be
interested
in
seeing
the
marcia
dropped
limply
into
a
chair
and
looked
at
her
aunt
is
dessart
coming
too
i
invited
him
certainly
what
s
the
matter
aren
t
you
pleased
i
thought
you
liked
oh
yes
i
do
wish
i
d
got
up
earlier
and
then
she
laughed
the
situation
was
rather
funny
after
all
she
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
suppose
we
send
over
to
palestrina
and
invite
benoit
for
dinner
she
suggested
presently
i
think
he
is
stopping
there
this
week
and
it
would
be
nice
to
have
him
i
suspect
she
added
that
he
is
a
tiny
bit
interested
in
a
note
was
sent
by
a
groom
who
returned
with
the
information
that
he
had
found
the
gentleman
sitting
on
a
rock
in
a
field
painting
a
portrait
of
a
sheep
that
he
had
delivered
the
note
and
got
this
in
return
this
was
a
rapid
sketch
on
representing
the
young
frenchman
in
evening
clothes
making
a
bow
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
to
the
two
ladies
who
received
him
on
the
steps
of
the
loggia
while
a
clock
in
the
corner
pointed
to
eight
marcia
looked
at
the
sketch
and
laughed
here
s
an
original
acceptance
aunt
copley
smiled
appreciatively
he
seems
to
be
a
very
original
young
man
she
conceded
he
s
prix
de
when
frenchmen
nice
they
are
very
nice
said
copley
but
when
they
are
words
failed
her
and
she
picked
up
her
embroidery
again
at
the
breakfast
marcia
announced
rather
hopefully
that
she
did
not
think
the
roystons
would
come
why
not
her
aunt
inquired
they
ve
lost
their
maid
and
there
won
t
be
anybody
to
help
them
pack
if
they
come
out
to
the
villa
they
won
t
be
ready
to
start
for
perugia
on
wednesday
besides
royston
never
likes
to
do
anything
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
likes
to
plan
her
programme
a
week
ahead
and
stick
to
it
oh
i
know
they
won
t
come
she
added
with
a
laugh
m
benoit
will
be
the
only
guest
after
and
i
ve
ordered
dinner
for
eight
said
copley
pathetically
i
am
thinking
of
driving
over
to
the
contessa
s
this
might
invite
her
to
join
oh
no
aunt
katherine
please
not
if
the
roystons
should
come
there
ll
be
a
big
enough
party
without
her
and
anyway
she
wouldn
t
be
particularly
sybert
isn
t
the
contessa
comes
to
see
us
not
sybert
copley
returned
with
a
touch
of
asperity
marcia
smiled
into
her
cup
of
chocolate
and
said
nothing
while
the
sun
was
sunk
in
its
noonday
torpor
she
stood
by
her
window
gazing
absently
off
toward
the
old
monastery
engaged
in
a
last
valiant
struggle
to
make
up
her
mind
she
finally
turned
away
with
an
impatient
shrug
which
banished
paul
dessart
and
his
importunities
to
the
bottom
of
the
dead
sea
there
was
no
use
in
bothering
any
more
about
it
now
royston
s
mind
at
least
was
no
weathercock
marcia
clung
tenaciously
to
the
hope
that
they
would
not
come
it
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
fresh
and
sparkling
from
the
week
of
rain
and
she
suddenly
decided
upon
a
horseback
ride
to
brush
from
her
mind
all
bothersome
questions
she
got
out
her
and
jerked
the
with
a
force
which
set
bells
jangling
wildly
through
the
house
and
brought
granton
as
nearly
on
a
run
as
was
consonant
with
her
dignity
and
years
it
s
nothing
serious
marcia
laughed
in
response
to
the
maid
s
anxious
face
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
go
for
a
ride
and
in
the
first
flush
of
energy
i
rang
louder
than
i
meant
it
s
a
great
thing
granton
to
get
your
mind
made
up
about
even
so
unimportant
a
matter
as
a
horseback
yes
miss
granton
agreed
somewhat
vaguely
as
she
knelt
down
to
help
with
a
boot
how
in
the
world
do
those
soldiers
in
the
king
s
guard
ever
get
their
boots
on
marcia
asked
i
don
t
know
miss
said
granton
patiently
marcia
laughed
send
word
to
the
stables
for
angelo
to
bring
the
horses
in
fifteen
minutes
i
m
going
to
take
a
long
ride
and
i
must
start
very
well
marcia
called
after
her
in
dealing
with
angelo
reiteration
was
necessary
he
was
an
italian
and
he
had
still
to
learn
the
value
of
time
she
tied
her
stock
before
the
glass
in
a
very
mannish
fashion
adjusted
her
the
least
perceptible
catching
up
her
whip
and
gloves
started
out
gaily
humming
a
snatch
of
a
very
much
reiterated
neapolitan
street
song
jammo
ncoppa
jammo
jà
it
ended
in
a
series
of
trills
she
did
not
know
the
words
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
met
granton
returning
granton
stood
primly
expressionless
waiting
patiently
for
her
to
have
done
before
venturing
to
speak
marcia
completed
her
measure
and
broke
off
with
a
laugh
well
granton
what
s
the
matter
angelo
has
taken
master
gerald
s
pony
to
palestrina
to
be
shod
and
both
of
the
carriages
are
to
be
used
so
the
other
men
will
be
needed
for
them
and
there
isn
t
any
one
left
to
ride
with
marcia
s
smile
changed
to
a
frown
how
stupid
angelo
has
no
business
to
go
off
without
saying
mr
copley
left
orders
for
him
to
have
the
pony
he
s
not
copley
s
groom
he
s
yes
miss
said
granton
marcia
went
on
slowly
downstairs
her
frown
gathering
volume
as
she
proceeded
she
wished
to
take
a
horseback
ride
and
she
wished
nothing
else
for
the
moment
she
foresaw
that
her
aunt
would
propose
that
she
ride
into
tivoli
and
take
tea
with
the
contessa
if
there
was
one
thing
she
hated
it
was
to
ride
at
a
steady
beside
the
carriage
and
if
there
was
a
second
thing
it
was
to
take
tea
with
the
contessa
she
heard
copley
s
and
gerald
s
voices
in
the
salon
and
she
advanced
to
the
doorway
aunt
katherine
i
m
furious
this
is
the
first
time
in
four
days
that
it
has
stopped
raining
long
enough
for
me
to
go
out
and
i
m
to
take
a
gallop
in
the
country
that
miserable
angelo
has
gone
off
with
gerald
s
pony
and
there
isn
t
another
man
on
the
place
that
can
go
with
me
you
needn
t
propose
my
riding
into
tivoli
to
take
tea
with
the
contessa
for
i
won
t
do
she
delivered
this
outburst
from
the
threshold
and
as
she
advanced
into
the
room
she
was
slightly
disconcerted
to
see
laurence
sybert
lazily
pulling
himself
from
a
chair
to
greet
she
ever
showed
in
a
particularly
bad
light
sybert
was
sure
to
be
at
hand
he
bowed
his
face
politely
grave
but
there
was
the
provoking
suggestion
of
a
smile
not
far
below
the
surface
and
as
she
looked
at
him
marcia
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
her
own
face
was
growing
red
i
m
sorry
about
angelo
my
dear
said
copley
i
didn
t
know
that
you
wanted
to
ride
this
afternoon
but
here
is
sybert
who
has
come
out
to
see
your
uncle
and
your
uncle
won
t
be
back
till
evening
i
m
sure
he
will
be
glad
to
go
with
marcia
glanced
back
at
her
aunt
with
an
expression
which
said
oh
aunt
katherine
wait
till
i
get
you
alone
certainly
miss
marcia
i
should
be
delighted
to
fill
the
recreant
angelo
s
place
he
affirmed
but
in
a
tone
which
to
her
ear
did
not
express
any
undue
eagerness
thank
you
sybert
she
smiled
sweetly
you
are
very
kind
but
i
shouldn
t
think
of
troubling
you
i
know
that
aunt
katherine
would
like
to
have
you
go
with
her
to
call
on
the
if
you
will
permit
it
miss
marcia
i
will
ride
with
you
instead
for
though
i
should
be
happy
to
call
on
contessa
torrenieri
with
copley
i
have
just
driven
out
from
tivoli
and
by
way
of
change
i
should
prefer
not
driving
it
s
awfully
kind
of
you
to
offer
but
i
don
t
really
want
to
ride
i
was
just
cross
with
angelo
for
going
off
without
saying
marcia
remonstrated
copley
that
doesn
t
sound
sybert
laughed
there
is
nothing
miss
marcia
he
declared
that
would
give
me
more
pleasure
this
afternoon
than
a
gallop
with
you
and
with
your
he
touched
the
bell
marcia
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
gave
the
order
as
pietro
appeared
send
word
to
the
stables
for
kentucky
lil
and
triumvirate
to
be
saddled
at
you
may
go
upstairs
and
borrow
as
much
of
howard
s
wardrobe
as
you
wish
said
copley
i
dare
say
you
did
not
come
prepared
to
play
the
part
of
i
ll
try
not
to
get
them
muddier
than
necessary
he
promised
as
he
turned
toward
the
stairs
he
reappeared
shortly
in
corduroys
and
leather
puttees
marcia
was
leaning
on
the
loggia
balustrade
idly
watching
the
hills
while
a
diminutive
slowly
led
the
horses
back
and
forth
in
the
driveway
sybert
helped
her
to
mount
without
a
word
and
they
galloped
down
the
avenue
in
silence
he
appreciated
the
fact
that
she
would
have
preferred
staying
at
home
to
accepting
his
escort
and
the
situation
promised
some
slight
entertainment
a
man
inclined
to
be
a
trifle
sardonic
can
find
considerable
amusement
in
the
spectacle
of
a
pretty
girl
who
does
not
wish
to
talk
to
him
but
finds
herself
in
a
position
where
she
can
not
escape
as
sybert
had
been
passing
a
very
hard
week
he
was
the
more
willing
to
enjoy
a
little
relaxation
at
marcia
s
expense
they
pulled
their
horses
to
a
walk
at
the
gateway
and
sybert
looked
at
her
interrogatively
she
took
the
lead
and
turned
to
the
left
along
the
winding
roadway
that
led
up
into
the
mountains
away
from
the
via
prænestina
he
rode
up
beside
her
again
and
they
galloped
on
without
speaking
marcia
did
not
propose
to
take
the
initiative
in
any
conversation
he
could
introduce
a
subject
if
he
wished
otherwise
they
would
keep
still
for
the
first
mile
or
so
he
maintained
the
stolid
reserve
of
a
groom
but
finally
as
they
slowed
the
horses
to
a
walk
on
a
steep
he
broke
the
silence
are
we
going
anywhere
or
just
riding
for
pleasure
just
for
he
waited
until
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
before
renewing
the
conversation
then
it
is
a
pleasant
day
he
observed
marcia
regarded
the
landscape
critically
very
pleasant
she
acquiesced
looks
a
little
like
rain
however
he
added
anxiously
fixing
his
eye
on
a
small
cloud
on
the
horizon
marcia
studied
the
sky
a
moment
with
an
heroic
effort
at
seriousness
and
then
she
began
to
laugh
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
she
remarked
philosophy
is
the
wisest
way
he
agreed
have
you
seen
gervasio
i
have
not
yet
paid
my
respects
to
him
he
is
well
i
trust
he
is
simply
a
walking
appetite
i
thought
he
showed
a
tendency
that
way
copley
says
that
you
have
been
suffering
persecution
for
his
did
she
tell
you
about
his
stepfather
that
s
my
story
she
ought
to
have
left
it
for
me
i
can
tell
it
much
more
dramatically
it
was
quite
an
adventure
wasn
t
it
it
was
and
you
got
off
easily
it
might
have
turned
out
to
be
more
of
an
adventure
than
you
would
have
cared
oh
i
like
when
they
re
ended
safely
yes
but
these
italian
peasants
are
a
revengeful
lot
when
they
get
it
into
their
heads
that
they
have
been
mistreated
i
don
t
believe
you
ought
to
drive
about
the
country
that
i
should
think
that
two
boys
and
a
groom
might
be
escort
doesn
t
accommodate
many
nevertheless
joking
apart
i
don
t
think
it
is
safe
the
country
s
pretty
thoroughly
stirred
up
just
at
you
re
as
bad
as
aunt
katherine
with
her
tattooed
man
as
for
being
afraid
of
these
peasants
i
know
every
soul
in
castel
vivalanti
and
they
re
all
the
exception
of
gervasio
s
if
i
were
your
uncle
he
observed
i
should
prefer
a
niece
readier
to
take
i
am
ready
to
take
his
suggestions
but
you
re
not
my
no
said
sybert
i
am
not
and
what
marcia
asked
he
laughed
i
believe
we
declared
an
amnesty
did
we
not
do
you
think
it
is
best
to
reopen
hostilities
it
strikes
me
that
there
has
been
more
or
less
light
skirmishing
in
spite
of
the
at
least
there
has
been
no
serious
damage
done
on
either
side
i
would
suggest
if
heavy
firing
is
to
be
recommenced
that
we
postpone
it
until
the
ride
very
well
let
s
talk
some
more
about
the
weather
it
seems
to
be
the
only
subject
on
which
we
can
sybert
bowed
gravely
it
s
been
rather
rainy
for
the
last
the
villa
must
have
been
a
little
and
rather
monotonous
very
marcia
laughed
and
gave
the
dialogue
a
new
turn
i
spent
the
time
indeed
the
meredith
don
t
you
find
him
a
rainy
weather
you
know
i
found
the
she
returned
a
most
suggestive
work
it
throws
interesting
on
the
men
one
oh
come
miss
marcia
he
remonstrated
that
s
hardly
fair
you
slander
you
mustn
t
blame
must
blame
the
author
it
s
a
man
who
wrote
he
should
be
regarded
as
a
traitor
in
case
he
is
captured
and
brought
into
camp
i
shall
order
him
shot
at
he
doesn
t
accuse
all
men
of
being
sir
willoughbys
she
returned
soothingly
i
hadn
t
thought
of
you
in
exactly
that
connexion
if
you
choose
to
wear
the
coat
you
have
put
it
on
we
ll
say
then
that
it
doesn
t
fit
and
i
ll
resemble
the
other
daniel
deronda
s
his
name
whitfield
whitford
whitford
it
will
be
remembered
was
the
dark
horse
who
came
in
at
the
finish
and
captured
the
heroine
marcia
laughed
i
really
can
t
say
that
the
other
fits
any
better
i
m
afraid
you
re
not
in
the
book
they
came
to
a
fork
in
the
roads
and
drew
rein
again
which
way
he
asked
she
paused
and
looked
about
they
were
already
far
up
in
the
mountains
and
towering
ahead
nearer
and
clearer
now
on
the
crest
of
a
still
higher
ridge
rose
the
old
monastery
she
could
see
from
her
window
she
pointed
with
her
whip
to
the
gaunt
pile
of
grey
stone
against
the
sky
is
that
your
destination
he
asked
is
it
too
far
i
ve
been
wanting
to
see
it
closer
ever
since
we
came
to
the
he
studied
the
distance
i
should
judge
it
s
about
seven
kilometres
in
a
straight
line
but
there
s
no
telling
how
long
the
road
takes
to
get
there
we
can
try
it
though
and
if
you
re
not
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
we
may
reach
at
any
rate
there
s
nothing
to
prevent
our
turning
back
if
we
find
it
s
too
far
she
suggested
oh
yes
one
can
always
turn
back
he
agreed
one
can
always
turn
the
words
caught
marcia
s
attention
and
she
repeated
them
to
herself
they
seemed
to
carry
an
inner
meaning
and
she
commenced
weighing
anew
her
feelings
toward
paul
could
she
turn
back
was
it
not
too
late
no
if
she
were
on
the
wrong
road
the
sooner
the
better
but
was
she
on
the
wrong
road
there
were
no
the
end
was
hidden
by
a
turning
she
rode
on
forgetting
to
talk
with
a
shadow
on
her
face
and
a
serious
light
in
her
eyes
well
sybert
inquired
would
you
like
my
advice
i
m
afraid
it
s
not
a
matter
you
can
help
me
with
she
returned
with
a
quick
laugh
they
pushed
on
farther
up
into
the
hills
between
groves
of
twisted
olive
trees
and
sloping
vineyards
through
fields
dyed
blue
and
scarlet
with
and
poppies
all
nature
was
green
and
glistening
after
the
rain
and
the
mountain
breeze
blew
fresh
against
their
faces
neither
could
be
insensible
to
the
influence
of
the
day
their
talk
was
light
and
free
and
badinage
but
it
occasionally
struck
a
deeper
note
and
holding
it
for
an
instant
half
reluctantly
let
it
go
marcia
had
never
known
sybert
in
this
had
not
as
she
realized
known
him
in
any
in
all
their
casual
intercourse
of
the
past
few
months
they
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
single
idea
he
was
an
unexplored
country
and
his
character
held
for
her
the
attraction
of
the
unknown
sybert
on
his
side
glanced
at
her
curiously
from
time
to
time
as
she
flung
back
a
quick
reply
with
him
first
impressions
died
hard
he
had
first
seen
marcia
at
a
tea
the
centre
of
a
laughing
group
with
all
the
room
paying
court
to
her
she
was
pretty
and
attractive
faultlessly
gowned
thoroughly
at
ease
he
had
in
his
thirteen
seasons
met
many
women
who
played
many
parts
and
the
somewhat
cynical
conclusion
he
had
carried
away
from
the
experience
was
that
if
a
woman
be
but
young
and
fair
she
has
the
gift
to
know
it
but
as
he
watched
her
now
he
wondered
suddenly
if
she
were
quite
what
he
had
thought
her
it
struck
him
that
what
he
had
regarded
as
was
rather
the
of
youth
her
occasional
crudeness
but
the
crudeness
that
comes
from
lack
of
experience
she
knew
nothing
of
life
outside
the
carefully
closed
confines
of
her
own
small
world
and
yet
he
recognized
in
her
a
certain
reckless
spirit
of
daring
of
curiosity
toward
the
world
that
responded
to
a
chord
in
his
own
nature
he
had
seen
it
the
night
they
found
gervasio
it
was
in
her
face
now
as
she
galloped
along
against
the
wind
with
her
eyes
raised
to
the
towers
of
the
mediæval
monastery
he
had
not
been
very
lenient
toward
her
he
knew
and
her
scarcely
veiled
antagonism
had
amused
him
he
felt
now
as
he
watched
her
a
momentary
impulse
to
draw
her
out
to
mould
the
direction
of
her
thoughts
to
turn
her
face
a
new
way
after
a
wild
gallop
along
the
crest
of
a
hill
she
drew
up
laughing
to
steady
her
hair
which
threatened
to
come
tumbling
down
about
her
ears
she
dropped
the
rein
loosely
on
the
horse
s
neck
in
order
to
leave
both
hands
free
and
sybert
reached
over
and
took
it
see
here
young
lady
he
remonstrated
you
re
going
to
take
a
cropper
some
day
if
you
ride
like
she
glanced
back
with
a
quick
retort
on
her
lips
but
his
expression
disarmed
her
he
was
not
watching
her
with
his
usual
critical
look
she
changed
the
words
into
a
laugh
do
you
know
what
you
make
me
feel
like
doing
sybert
giving
lil
the
reins
and
galloping
down
that
hill
there
with
my
hands
in
the
perhaps
i
would
better
keep
the
reins
in
my
own
hands
was
his
cool
proposition
i
never
knew
any
one
who
could
rouse
so
much
latent
antagonism
in
a
person
as
you
can
you
never
say
a
word
but
i
feel
like
doing
exactly
the
it
s
well
to
know
it
i
shall
frame
my
future
suggestions
marcia
settled
her
hat
and
stretched
out
her
hand
he
returned
the
reins
with
a
show
of
doubt
can
i
trust
you
to
restrain
your
impulses
he
inquired
with
his
eyes
on
the
declivity
before
them
she
gathered
up
the
reins
but
made
no
movement
to
go
on
instead
she
in
the
saddle
and
looked
behind
they
were
on
the
shoulder
of
a
mountain
below
them
smaller
foothills
receded
tier
below
tier
until
they
sank
imperceptibly
into
the
level
plain
of
the
campagna
ahead
of
them
the
bare
sabines
stretched
in
broken
ridges
backed
in
the
distance
by
two
of
the
apennines
everywhere
was
the
warmth
of
colouring
the
brilliant
hues
of
an
italian
spring
italy
is
beautiful
isn
t
it
marcia
asked
simply
yes
he
agreed
italy
is
cursed
with
she
turned
her
eyes
inquiringly
from
the
landscape
to
him
a
nation
of
artists
models
he
exclaimed
half
contemptuously
because
of
their
fatal
good
looks
the
italians
can
t
be
allowed
to
be
prosperous
like
any
other
perhaps
she
suggested
their
beauty
is
a
compensation
they
are
poor
i
know
but
don
t
you
think
they
know
how
to
be
happy
in
spite
of
it
they
are
too
easily
happy
that
s
another
but
you
surely
don
t
want
them
to
be
unhappy
she
remonstrated
since
they
have
to
be
poor
shouldn
t
you
rather
see
them
contented
certainly
not
they
have
nothing
to
be
contented
but
i
don
t
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
you
are
contented
with
so
long
as
you
he
looked
at
her
with
a
nonsense
miss
marcia
you
know
better
than
that
when
people
are
contented
with
their
lot
does
their
lot
ever
improve
do
you
think
the
italian
people
to
be
happy
you
have
seen
the
way
they
live
he
broke
off
you
don
t
know
anything
about
yes
i
do
she
returned
i
know
they
re
they
seem
to
get
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
life
in
spite
of
he
shook
his
head
you
can
t
convince
me
with
that
argument
have
you
never
heard
of
a
holy
discontent
that
s
what
these
people
he
added
grimly
some
of
them
have
got
a
holy
discontent
she
repeated
what
a
terrible
thing
to
have
it
s
like
living
for
oh
well
he
shrugged
a
man
must
live
for
something
besides
his
three
meals
a
he
can
live
for
his
family
she
suggested
yes
if
he
has
one
otherwise
he
must
live
for
an
she
glanced
at
him
sidewise
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
what
idea
he
lived
for
but
it
was
a
question
she
did
not
dare
to
put
instead
she
commented
it
s
queer
isn
t
it
how
the
ideas
that
men
used
to
live
for
have
passed
away
chivalry
and
crusading
and
going
to
war
and
living
as
really
don
t
see
what
s
the
most
of
the
old
ideals
are
exploded
he
agreed
but
we
have
new
ones
meet
the
needs
of
the
present
century
a
man
can
make
a
god
of
his
business
for
marcia
shifted
her
seat
a
trifle
uneasily
as
she
thought
of
her
father
who
certainly
did
make
a
god
of
his
business
it
may
have
struck
sybert
that
it
was
not
a
propitious
subject
for
he
added
almost
and
there
s
always
art
to
fall
back
but
you
don
t
object
to
that
she
remonstrated
no
it
s
good
enough
in
its
way
he
agreed
but
it
doesn
t
go
very
artists
would
tell
you
then
that
it
isn
t
the
true
i
dare
say
he
shrugged
but
at
best
there
are
a
good
many
truer
what
for
instance
well
three
meals
a
marcia
laughed
and
then
she
suppose
you
knew
a
person
sybert
who
didn
t
care
for
anything
but
just
wanted
to
have
the
world
beautiful
and
nothing
else
what
would
you
think
not
much
he
returned
what
would
you
i
think
that
you
go
a
great
deal
farther
in
the
other
extreme
not
at
all
he
maintained
i
am
granting
that
art
is
a
very
fine
thing
only
there
are
so
many
more
vital
issues
in
life
that
one
doesn
t
have
time
to
bother
with
it
much
however
i
suppose
it
s
a
phase
one
has
to
go
through
with
in
italy
oh
i
ve
been
through
with
it
too
he
added
i
used
to
feel
that
botticelli
and
giorgione
and
the
rest
of
them
were
really
but
you
got
over
it
she
inquired
yes
i
got
over
marcia
laughed
again
mr
sybert
she
said
i
think
you
are
an
awfully
queer
man
you
are
so
sort
of
unfeeling
in
some
respects
and
feeling
in
miss
marcia
you
strike
me
as
an
awfully
queer
young
woman
for
exactly
the
same
they
had
come
to
a
curve
in
the
road
and
under
an
precipice
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
was
a
little
shrine
to
the
madonna
and
beside
it
a
rough
iron
cross
some
poor
devil
has
met
his
fate
here
said
sybert
and
he
reined
in
his
horse
and
leaned
from
his
saddle
to
make
out
the
blurred
inscription
traced
on
the
bars
felice
buconi
in
the
year
at
this
spot
received
death
at
the
hand
of
an
assassin
pray
for
his
soul
he
translated
poor
fellow
it
s
a
tragedy
in
italy
to
meet
one
s
death
at
the
hands
of
an
why
more
in
italy
than
in
any
other
place
because
one
dies
without
receiving
the
sacrament
and
has
some
trouble
about
getting
into
oh
she
returned
i
suppose
when
gervasio
s
father
wished
that
i
might
die
of
an
apoplexy
he
was
not
only
damning
me
for
this
world
but
for
the
world
to
exactly
an
apoplexy
in
italy
is
a
comprehensive
i
think
she
commented
that
i
prefer
a
religion
which
doesn
t
have
a
purgatory
he
returned
has
always
struck
me
as
quite
superior
to
anything
the
protestants
offer
it
really
gives
one
something
to
die
i
should
think
for
the
matter
of
that
that
heaven
direct
would
give
one
something
to
die
what
for
instance
golden
eternal
sunshine
and
singing
angels
oh
not
necessarily
just
those
things
they
re
merely
at
least
said
sybert
perfect
peace
and
beauty
and
happiness
and
nothing
beyond
you
needn
t
tell
me
miss
marcia
that
you
want
to
spend
an
eternity
in
any
such
place
as
that
it
might
do
for
a
for
ever
probably
angels
ideas
of
happiness
are
more
settled
than
men
in
that
case
angels
must
be
infinitely
lower
than
men
to
be
happy
in
a
place
that
has
reached
the
end
that
stands
still
would
require
a
very
selfish
i
don
t
see
why
not
a
very
selfish
settle
down
contentedly
to
an
eternity
of
bliss
while
there
s
still
so
much
work
to
be
done
in
the
i
suppose
she
suggested
that
when
you
get
to
be
an
angel
you
forget
about
the
world
and
leave
all
the
sorrow
and
misery
a
fools
paradise
he
maintained
they
were
suddenly
aroused
from
their
talk
by
a
peal
of
thunder
they
looked
up
to
see
that
the
sun
had
disappeared
sybert
s
small
cloud
on
the
horizon
had
grown
until
it
covered
the
sky
well
miss
marcia
he
laughed
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
to
get
a
wetting
to
pay
for
our
immersion
in
philosophy
and
art
shall
we
turn
back
if
we
re
going
to
get
wet
anyway
she
said
i
should
prefer
seeing
the
monastery
first
since
we
ve
come
so
she
looked
across
the
valley
in
front
of
them
where
not
half
a
mile
away
the
walls
rose
grim
and
gaunt
amid
a
cluster
of
cypresses
you
can
see
about
as
much
from
here
as
you
could
if
you
went
any
nearer
he
returned
i
should
advise
you
to
look
and
as
he
spoke
a
cool
wind
swept
up
the
valley
swaying
the
olive
trees
and
turning
their
leaves
to
silver
a
flash
of
lightning
followed
and
a
few
big
drops
splashed
in
their
faces
we
re
in
for
it
marcia
exclaimed
as
she
struggled
to
control
kentucky
lil
who
was
quivering
and
plunging
sybert
glanced
about
quickly
the
flying
clouds
overhead
and
an
ominous
orange
light
that
had
suddenly
settled
down
upon
the
landscape
betokened
that
a
severe
mountain
storm
was
at
hand
they
would
be
drenched
through
before
they
could
reach
the
after
all
might
not
prove
a
hospitable
order
to
ladies
he
presently
spied
a
low
stone
building
nearer
at
hand
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
they
had
just
left
behind
we
d
better
make
for
that
he
said
pointing
it
out
with
his
whip
though
it
hasn
t
a
very
promising
look
it
will
at
least
be
a
shelter
until
the
storm
is
chapter
xiii
the
drops
were
falling
fast
by
the
time
they
reached
the
building
they
hastily
dismounted
and
pushed
forward
to
the
wide
stone
archway
which
served
as
entrance
a
door
of
rudely
joined
boards
swung
across
the
opening
but
it
was
ajar
and
banging
in
the
wind
sybert
threw
it
open
and
led
the
horses
into
the
gloomy
interior
it
proved
to
be
a
probably
belonging
to
the
monastery
the
room
was
low
but
deep
with
a
dirt
floor
and
rough
masonry
walls
in
the
rear
two
huge
vats
rose
dimly
to
the
roof
and
the
floor
was
scattered
with
the
air
was
damp
and
musty
and
pungent
with
the
smell
of
fermenting
sybert
fastened
the
horses
to
a
low
beam
by
means
of
their
bridles
while
marcia
sat
down
upon
a
plough
and
pensively
regarded
the
landscape
he
presently
joined
her
this
is
not
a
very
cheerful
refuge
he
remarked
but
at
least
it
is
drier
than
the
open
she
moved
along
and
offered
him
part
of
her
seat
i
think
i
can
improve
on
that
he
said
as
he
rummaged
out
a
board
from
a
pile
of
lumber
and
fitted
it
at
a
somewhat
precarious
slope
across
the
plough
they
gingerly
sat
down
upon
it
and
marcia
i
suppose
if
you
had
your
way
sybert
we
should
be
sitting
on
a
mccormick
it
would
at
least
be
more
comfortable
he
returned
the
rain
was
beating
fiercely
by
this
time
and
the
lightning
flashes
were
following
each
other
in
quick
succession
black
clouds
were
rolling
inland
from
across
the
volscian
mountains
and
piling
layer
upon
layer
above
their
heads
marcia
sat
watching
the
gathering
storm
and
presently
she
exclaimed
this
might
be
a
situation
out
of
a
book
to
be
overtaken
by
a
thunderstorm
in
the
sabine
mountains
and
seek
shelter
in
a
deserted
sounds
like
one
of
the
duchess
s
it
does
have
a
familiar
ring
he
agreed
it
only
remains
for
you
to
sprain
your
she
laughed
softly
with
an
undertone
of
excitement
in
her
voice
i
ve
never
had
so
many
adventures
in
my
life
as
since
we
came
out
to
villa
and
gervasio
and
gervasio
s
stepfather
and
now
a
in
the
mountains
if
they
re
going
to
rise
to
a
climax
i
can
t
imagine
what
our
stay
will
end
henry
james
you
know
says
that
the
only
adventures
worth
having
are
intellectual
marcia
considered
this
proposition
doubtfully
in
an
intellectual
adventure
she
objected
you
could
never
be
quite
sure
that
it
really
an
adventure
you
d
always
be
afraid
you
d
imagined
half
of
it
i
think
i
prefer
mine
more
visibly
exciting
there
s
something
picturesque
in
a
certain
amount
of
real
sybert
turned
his
eyes
away
from
her
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
oh
if
it
s
merely
bloodshed
you
re
after
he
said
dryly
you
ll
find
as
much
as
you
like
in
any
butcher
s
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
and
then
she
observed
i
suppose
you
are
disagreeable
on
purpose
sybert
you
have
she
hesitated
for
a
word
and
as
none
presented
itself
substituted
a
generic
way
of
answering
a
he
turned
back
toward
her
with
a
laugh
if
i
really
thought
you
meant
it
i
should
have
a
still
horrider
certainly
i
mean
it
she
declared
i
ve
always
liked
to
read
about
fights
and
plots
and
murders
in
books
i
think
it
s
nice
to
have
a
little
blood
spattered
about
it
s
a
sort
of
concrete
symbol
of
saw
a
concrete
symbol
of
courage
the
other
day
but
i
can
t
say
that
it
struck
me
as
what
was
it
a
fellow
lying
by
the
roadside
in
a
pool
of
dirty
water
and
blood
with
his
mouth
wide
open
a
couple
of
stiletto
wounds
in
his
neck
and
his
brains
spattered
over
his
may
be
useful
but
they
re
not
she
looked
at
him
gravely
with
a
slow
expression
of
disgust
i
suppose
you
think
i
m
horrider
than
ever
now
yes
said
marcia
i
then
don
t
make
any
such
absurd
statement
as
that
you
think
bloodshed
picturesque
the
world
s
got
beyond
that
do
you
object
if
i
smoke
i
don
t
think
it
would
hurt
this
place
to
have
a
bit
of
she
nodded
permission
and
watched
him
silently
as
he
rolled
a
cigarette
and
hunted
through
his
pockets
for
a
match
the
coat
did
not
reward
his
search
and
he
commenced
on
the
waistcoat
suddenly
she
broke
out
what
s
that
in
your
pocket
sybert
a
momentary
shade
of
annoyance
flashed
over
his
face
it
s
a
dynamite
it
s
a
revolver
what
are
you
carrying
that
for
it
s
against
the
don
t
tell
the
police
he
pleaded
i
ve
always
liked
to
play
with
it
s
a
habit
i
ve
never
why
are
you
carrying
it
she
repeated
sybert
found
his
match
and
lighted
his
cigarette
with
slow
deliberation
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
at
her
you
ask
too
many
questions
miss
marcia
he
said
and
he
commenced
pacing
back
and
forth
the
length
of
the
dirt
floor
she
remained
with
her
elbow
resting
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
looking
out
at
the
storm
presently
he
came
back
and
sat
down
again
is
our
amnesty
off
he
asked
before
she
could
open
her
mouth
to
respond
a
fierce
white
flash
of
lightning
came
followed
instantly
by
a
deafening
crash
of
thunder
a
torrent
of
water
came
pouring
down
on
the
loose
tiles
with
a
roar
that
sounded
like
a
cannonading
the
air
seemed
quivering
with
electricity
the
horses
plunged
and
snorted
in
terror
and
sybert
sprang
to
his
feet
to
quiet
them
jove
it
a
cloudburst
he
cried
marcia
ran
to
the
open
doorway
and
stood
looking
out
across
the
valley
the
water
was
coming
down
in
an
almost
solid
sheet
the
clouds
hung
low
and
black
and
impenetrable
except
when
a
jagged
line
of
lightning
cut
them
in
two
from
the
height
across
the
valley
the
tall
square
monastery
tower
rose
defiantly
into
the
very
midst
of
the
storm
while
the
cypress
trees
at
its
base
swayed
and
writhed
and
wrung
their
hands
in
agony
sybert
came
and
stood
beside
her
and
the
two
watched
the
storm
in
silence
there
he
suddenly
flashed
out
with
a
little
undertone
of
triumph
in
his
there
is
italy
he
nodded
toward
the
old
walls
rising
so
stanchly
from
the
storm
that
s
the
way
the
italians
have
weathered
tyranny
and
revolution
and
oppression
for
centuries
and
that
s
the
way
they
will
keep
on
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
and
caught
a
gleam
of
something
she
had
never
seen
before
in
his
face
it
was
as
if
an
internal
fire
were
blazing
through
for
an
imperceptible
second
he
held
her
look
then
his
eyelids
drooped
again
and
his
usual
expression
of
reserve
came
back
come
and
sit
down
he
said
you
re
getting
they
turned
back
to
the
plough
again
and
sat
side
by
side
looking
out
at
the
storm
the
beating
of
the
rain
on
the
tiles
above
their
heads
made
a
difficult
accompaniment
for
conversation
and
they
did
not
try
to
talk
but
they
were
electrically
aware
of
each
other
s
presence
the
wild
excitement
of
the
storm
had
taken
hold
of
both
of
them
marcia
s
breath
came
fast
through
slightly
parted
lips
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
hair
was
tumbled
and
there
was
a
yellow
glow
in
her
deep
grey
eyes
her
face
seemed
to
vivify
the
gloomy
interior
sybert
glanced
at
her
sidewise
once
or
twice
in
half
surprise
she
did
not
seem
exactly
the
person
he
had
thought
he
knew
her
hand
lay
in
her
lap
idly
clasping
her
gloves
and
whip
it
looked
white
and
soft
against
her
black
habit
suddenly
marcia
asked
a
question
will
you
tell
me
something
sybert
i
am
at
your
service
he
bowed
and
the
truth
oh
certainly
the
she
glanced
down
in
her
lap
a
moment
and
smoothed
the
fingers
of
her
gloves
in
a
thoughtful
silence
well
she
said
finally
i
don
t
know
after
all
what
i
want
to
ask
you
but
there
is
something
in
the
air
that
i
don
t
understand
tell
me
the
truth
about
the
truth
about
italy
he
repeated
the
words
with
a
slight
accent
of
surprise
last
week
in
rome
at
the
roystons
hotel
everybody
was
talking
about
the
wheat
famine
and
the
bread
riots
and
they
all
stopped
suddenly
when
i
asked
any
questions
uncle
howard
will
never
tell
me
a
thing
he
just
jokes
about
it
when
i
ask
he
s
afraid
said
sybert
no
one
dares
to
tell
the
truth
in
italy
it
s
lèse
she
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
to
see
what
he
meant
his
face
was
quite
grave
but
there
was
a
disagreeable
suggestion
of
a
smile
about
his
lips
she
looked
out
of
doors
again
with
an
angry
light
in
her
eyes
oh
i
think
you
are
beastly
she
cried
you
and
uncle
howard
both
act
as
if
i
were
ten
years
old
i
don
t
think
that
a
wheat
famine
is
any
subject
to
joke
miss
marcia
he
said
quietly
when
things
get
to
a
certain
point
if
you
wish
to
keep
your
senses
you
can
t
do
anything
but
joke
about
tell
me
she
said
there
was
a
look
of
troubled
expectancy
in
her
face
sybert
half
closed
his
eyes
and
studied
the
ground
without
speaking
not
very
many
days
before
he
had
felt
a
fierce
desire
to
hurl
the
story
at
her
to
confront
her
with
a
picture
of
the
suffering
that
her
father
had
caused
now
he
felt
as
strongly
as
her
uncle
that
she
must
not
know
since
you
can
not
do
anything
to
help
why
should
you
wish
to
understand
there
are
so
many
unpleasant
things
in
the
world
and
so
many
of
us
already
who
know
about
them
it
he
turned
toward
her
with
a
little
smile
but
one
which
she
did
not
well
it
s
a
relief
you
know
to
see
a
few
people
who
accept
their
happiness
as
a
free
gift
from
heaven
and
ask
no
i
am
not
a
baby
i
should
not
care
to
accept
happiness
on
any
such
and
you
want
to
know
about
italy
very
well
he
said
grimly
i
can
give
you
plenty
of
he
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
traced
lines
in
the
dirt
floor
with
his
whip
speaking
in
the
emotionless
tone
of
one
who
is
quoting
a
list
from
a
catalogue
the
poor
people
bear
of
the
taxes
every
necessity
of
life
is
and
salt
and
meat
and
such
things
as
carriages
and
servants
and
jewels
go
comparatively
free
when
the
government
has
squeezed
all
it
can
from
the
people
the
church
takes
its
share
and
then
the
government
comes
in
again
with
the
state
lotteries
the
latin
races
are
already
sufficiently
addicted
to
gambling
without
needing
any
extra
encouragement
from
the
state
part
of
the
revenue
thus
collected
is
spent
in
keeping
up
the
training
the
young
men
of
the
country
in
idleness
and
in
a
great
many
things
they
would
do
better
without
part
of
it
goes
to
build
arcades
and
fountains
and
statues
of
victor
emmanuel
the
most
of
it
stops
in
official
pockets
you
may
think
that
politics
are
as
corrupt
as
they
can
be
in
america
but
i
assure
you
it
is
not
the
case
in
italy
the
priests
won
t
let
the
people
vote
and
the
parliament
is
run
in
the
interests
of
a
few
the
people
are
ignorant
and
superstitious
more
than
half
of
them
can
neither
read
nor
write
and
the
government
exploits
them
as
it
pleases
the
farm
labourer
earns
only
from
to
thirty
cents
a
day
to
support
himself
and
his
family
fortunately
living
is
cheap
or
there
would
soon
not
be
any
farm
labourers
alive
last
he
paused
and
an
angry
flush
crept
under
his
dark
last
year
in
lombardy
venetia
and
the
of
the
most
fertile
provinces
in
thousand
people
went
mad
from
hunger
the
children
of
these
will
be
idiots
and
cripples
and
ten
years
from
now
you
will
find
them
on
the
steps
of
churches
holding
out
maimed
hands
for
coppers
at
this
present
moment
there
are
ten
thousand
people
in
naples
crowded
into
damp
caves
and
all
of
them
stricken
with
consumption
and
scrofula
and
sick
with
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
into
her
face
with
blazing
eyes
marcia
in
this
last
week
i
ve
he
burst
out
things
i
ve
seen
he
got
up
and
strode
to
the
door
and
marcia
sat
looking
after
him
with
frightened
eyes
the
air
seemed
charged
with
his
words
she
felt
herself
trembling
and
she
caught
her
breath
quickly
with
a
she
closed
her
eyes
and
pictures
rose
up
before
she
did
not
wish
to
see
she
thought
of
the
hordes
of
poor
people
in
castel
vivalanti
of
the
bony
wrinkled
hands
that
were
stretched
out
for
coppers
at
every
turn
of
the
crowds
of
children
with
hungry
faces
she
thought
of
the
houses
that
they
lived
little
dens
dark
and
filthy
and
damp
and
it
wasn
t
their
fault
she
repeated
to
herself
it
wasn
t
their
fault
they
were
honest
and
frugal
they
wanted
work
but
there
was
not
enough
to
go
around
she
sat
quite
still
for
several
moments
feeling
acutely
a
great
many
things
she
had
scarcely
divined
before
then
presently
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
great
vats
towering
out
of
the
darkness
behind
her
they
suddenly
presented
themselves
to
her
imagination
as
a
symbol
a
visible
sign
of
the
weight
of
society
bearing
down
upon
the
poor
crushing
out
goodness
and
happiness
and
hope
as
she
watched
them
with
eyes
they
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
until
they
dominated
the
whole
room
with
the
sense
of
their
oppressiveness
she
rose
with
a
little
shiver
and
almost
ran
to
the
door
let
s
go
she
cried
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
looking
at
her
face
nothing
i
want
to
go
it
s
stopped
he
led
out
the
horses
and
helped
her
to
mount
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
again
your
hand
is
trembling
did
i
say
anything
to
frighten
you
she
shook
her
head
without
answering
and
when
they
reached
the
road
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
fresh
air
and
glanced
back
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
had
the
most
horrible
feeling
in
there
i
felt
as
if
something
were
going
to
reach
out
from
those
vats
and
grab
me
from
i
think
he
suggested
that
you
d
better
take
some
of
your
aunt
s
quinine
when
you
get
mr
sybert
she
said
presently
i
told
you
one
day
that
i
thought
poor
people
were
picturesque
i
don
t
think
so
any
i
didn
t
suppose
that
you
meant
but
i
did
said
marcia
i
ve
merely
changed
my
she
touched
kentucky
lil
with
her
whip
and
splashed
on
ahead
down
the
road
that
led
toward
the
monastery
while
sybert
followed
with
a
slightly
perplexed
frown
the
storm
had
passed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
loose
flying
clouds
still
darkened
the
sky
but
the
heavy
black
were
already
far
to
the
eastward
over
the
apennines
in
its
brief
passage
however
the
storm
had
left
havoc
behind
it
the
vines
in
the
wayside
vineyards
were
stripped
of
their
leaves
and
the
bamboo
poles
they
were
trained
upon
broken
and
bent
branches
torn
from
the
olive
trees
were
strewn
over
the
grass
and
in
the
wheat
fields
the
young
grain
was
bowed
almost
to
the
ground
a
fierce
mountain
torrent
poured
down
the
side
of
the
road
through
a
gully
that
an
hour
before
had
been
dry
the
mountain
air
was
fresh
and
keen
and
the
horses
excited
by
the
storm
plunged
on
recklessly
irrespective
of
mud
and
water
they
crossed
the
little
valley
that
lay
between
the
hill
of
the
and
the
higher
hill
of
the
monastery
clattered
through
the
single
street
of
the
tiny
hamlet
which
huddled
itself
at
the
base
of
the
hill
and
wound
on
upward
along
the
narrow
walled
roadway
that
turned
and
unturned
upon
itself
like
the
coils
of
a
serpent
they
passed
through
the
dark
grove
of
cypresses
that
skirted
the
outer
walls
and
emerged
for
a
moment
on
a
small
plateau
which
gave
a
wide
view
of
receding
hills
and
valleys
and
hills
again
below
them
at
a
precipitous
angle
lay
the
valley
they
had
just
come
through
and
the
clustering
roofs
of
the
little
noah
s
ark
village
as
they
rode
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
by
a
common
impulse
they
both
drew
rein
and
brought
their
horses
to
a
standstill
at
the
edge
of
the
grove
away
to
the
eastward
the
sky
was
black
but
the
western
sky
was
a
blaze
of
orange
light
and
the
sun
an
orange
ball
was
dropping
into
the
purple
campagna
as
into
a
sea
the
shadows
were
settling
in
the
valley
beneath
them
but
the
hills
were
tinged
with
a
shimmering
light
and
the
tower
above
their
heads
was
glowing
in
a
sombre
softened
beauty
they
had
scarcely
had
time
however
to
more
than
glance
at
the
picture
before
them
when
they
became
aware
of
a
little
human
drama
that
was
being
enacted
under
their
eyes
a
young
monk
in
the
brown
cassock
of
the
franciscans
probably
a
lay
brother
in
the
monastery
was
standing
in
the
vineyard
by
the
roadside
resting
for
a
moment
from
his
task
of
tying
up
the
vines
that
had
been
beaten
down
by
the
storm
he
had
not
seen
the
back
was
turned
toward
them
and
his
gaze
was
resting
on
the
field
across
the
way
where
scarlet
poppies
were
growing
among
the
wheat
but
his
eyes
were
not
for
the
flowers
nor
yet
for
the
light
on
the
hills
he
had
seen
before
and
understood
he
was
watching
a
peasant
girl
and
a
man
dressed
in
shepherd
s
clothes
who
were
strolling
side
by
side
along
the
narrow
pathway
that
led
diagonally
through
the
wheat
the
man
and
brown
and
muscular
in
sheepskin
trousers
and
pointed
hat
was
bending
toward
her
talking
insistently
with
vehement
italian
gestures
she
appeared
to
listen
and
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
half
drew
back
while
her
mocking
laugh
rang
out
clearly
on
the
still
evening
air
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
he
boldly
put
his
arm
around
her
and
the
two
passed
down
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
in
the
direction
of
the
hamlet
the
poor
young
frate
his
work
forgotten
with
hands
idly
hanging
at
his
sides
stared
at
the
spot
where
they
had
disappeared
and
as
he
looked
the
monastery
bells
in
the
campanile
above
him
slowly
rang
out
the
ave
he
started
guiltily
and
with
a
hasty
sign
of
the
cross
caught
up
his
rosary
and
bowed
his
head
in
prayer
at
the
unexpected
sound
of
the
bells
the
horses
broke
into
a
quick
trot
the
monk
startled
at
the
clatter
of
hoofs
so
near
turned
suddenly
and
looked
in
their
direction
as
he
caught
sight
of
marcia
s
and
sybert
s
eyes
upon
him
and
knew
that
they
had
seen
a
quick
flush
spread
over
his
thin
dark
face
and
turning
away
he
bowed
his
head
again
marcia
broke
the
silence
with
a
low
laugh
as
they
rode
on
into
the
shade
of
the
cypresses
he
thought
we
and
then
she
stopped
lovers
too
said
sybert
poor
devil
i
suppose
he
thinks
the
world
is
full
of
lovers
outside
his
monastery
walls
there
he
added
is
a
man
who
is
living
for
an
and
is
beginning
to
suspect
that
it
is
the
wrong
he
shot
her
a
quick
glance
of
comprehension
ah
there
s
the
rub
he
returned
a
trifle
when
you
begin
to
suspect
your
idea
s
the
wrong
they
rode
on
down
the
hill
into
the
darkening
valley
they
were
going
the
straight
way
home
now
and
the
horses
knew
it
they
were
still
in
the
hills
when
the
twilight
faded
and
a
young
moon
just
beyond
the
crescent
took
its
place
riding
high
in
a
sky
scattered
thick
with
flying
clouds
it
was
a
wild
wet
windy
night
though
on
the
lower
levels
the
roads
were
fairly
dry
the
storm
had
evidently
wasted
its
fury
on
the
heights
it
was
too
fast
a
pace
to
admit
much
talking
and
they
both
contented
themselves
with
their
thoughts
only
once
did
marcia
break
the
silence
i
feel
as
if
we
were
carrying
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
sybert
laughed
and
quoted
softly
behind
shut
the
postern
the
lights
sank
to
rest
and
into
the
midnight
we
galloped
abreast
not
a
word
to
each
other
we
kept
the
great
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our
kentucky
lil
would
make
quite
a
roland

broke
off
she
s
the
nicest
horse
i
ever
rode
said
marcia
as
they
turned
in
at
the
villa
gates
she
said
contritely
i
didn
t
know
it
would
take
so
long
i
m
afraid
sybert
that
i
ve
made
you
very
late
perhaps

adventures
too
he
smiled
and
you
and
i
miss
marcia
have
travelled
far
chapter
xiv
as
they
galloped
up
the
long
avenue
under
the
arching
trees
the
villa
presently
came
into
view
the
sound
of
laughing
voices
floated
out
from
the
open
windows
marcia
drew
rein
with
a
cry
of
dismay
the
roystons
had
come

forgotten

explained
to
her
companion
we
re
giving
a
at
the
sound
of
the
clattering
hoofs
on
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
a
gay
group
poured
out
on
to
the
loggia
welcoming
the
dilatory
riders
with
laughter
and
questions
and
greetings
my
dear
child
where
have
you
been
here
pietro

some
one
to
take

this
the
way

been
waiting
half
an
hour
we
were
beginning
to
i

been
worried
to
death
you
haven
t
caught
cold
have
you
no
aunt
katherine
she
laughed
as
she
pulled
off
her
gloves
and
shook
hands
with
the
visitors
but
we
ve
been
nearly
drowned
we
should
have
been
wholly
drowned
if
sybert
hadn
t
spied
a
very
leaky
ark
on
the
top
of
a
i
m
relieved
sighed
her
uncle
as
they
passed
into
the
hall
i
was
beginning
to
fear
that
you
had
had
a
disagreement
on
the
way
and
that
it
was
another
case
of
the
kilkenny
marcia
how
you
look
you
re
covered
with
mud
cried
copley
with
a
slightly
apprehensive
glance
toward
the
mirror
marcia
straightened
her
hat
and
rubbed
a
daub
of
mud
from
her
cheek
kentucky
lil
and
triumvirate
were
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
get
home
to
turn
out
for
puddles
she
said
how
much
time
may
we
have
to
dress
aunt
katherine
just
fifteen
minutes
returned
her
uncle
and
that
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
than
you
deserve
if
you
are
not
down
then
we
shall
eat
without
waiting
for
fifteen
minutes
remember
cried
marcia
to
sybert
as
they
parted
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
ll
race
with
you
she
added
though
i
think
myself
that
a
girl
ought
to
have
a
she
found
granton
a
picture
of
prim
disapproval
waiting
with
her
dress
spread
out
on
the
bed
marcia
dropped
into
a
wicker
chair
with
a
tired
sigh
you
ve
ridden
a
long
way
granton
remarked
as
she
removed
a
muddy
boot
yes
granton
i
have
and
dinner
s
already
been
waiting
half
an
hour
and
pietro
looks
like
a

copley
looks
worried
and
the
guests
look
françois
looks
like
i
don
t
dare
to
think
we
must
our
reputations
depend
on
am
i
ready
she
inquired
not
much
more
than
fifteen
minutes
later
as
she
twisted
her
head
to
view
the
effect
in
the
mirror
you
ll
do
very
well
said
granton
i
m
terribly
tired
she
sighed
and
i
feel
more
like
going
to
bed
than
facing
i
suppose
in
the
natural
order
of
events
dinner
must
be
accomplished
to
be
sure
said
the
maid
critically
adjusting
her
train
your
philosophy
is
so
comfortable
granton
as
we
have
done
yesterday
so
shall
we
do
and
also
it
saves
one
the
trouble
of
making
up
one
s
she
reached
the
salon
just
in
time
to
take
paul
dessart
s
silently
offered
arm
to
the
sybert
did
not
appear
until
the
soup
was
being
removed
he
possessed
himself
of
the
empty
chair
beside
eleanor
royston
with
a
murmured
apology
to
his
hostess
it
s
excusable
sybert
said
copley
with
a
frown
you
should
not
allow
a
woman
to
beat
the
furniture
in
that
room
you
gave
me
he
complained
gravely
was
built
as
a
trap
for
the
side
of
the
bed
comes
to
within
three
inches
of
the
couldn
t
crawl
what
did
you
do
eleanor
royston
asked
i
borrowed
one
of
our
host
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
i
shall
put
my
wardrobe
under
lock
and
key
the
next
time
you
visit
us
copley
declared
sybert
was
curiously
inspecting
a
small
white
globule
he
found
by
his
plate
marcia
laughed
and
called
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
it
s
your
own
prescription
sybert
drop
it
in
your
and
drink
it
like
a
man
i
ve
taken
my
during
this
exchange
of
badinage
paul
dessart
said
never
a
word
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
moodily
on
the
hates
to
say
it
of
sulked
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
known
him
marcia
found
him
he
started
no
subject
himself
and
those
that
she
started
after
a
brief
career
fell
lifeless
it
may
have
been
that
she
herself
was
somewhat
ill
at
ease
but
in
any
case
several
awkward
silences
fell
between
them
which
the
young
man
made
no
attempt
to
break
copley
would
never
have
said
of
him
that
he
was
an
ornament
to
any
it
fell
to
the
frenchman
across
the
way
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
in
an
errant
glance
toward
the
other
end
of
the
table
marcia
saw
sybert
laughing
softly
at
something
eleanor
had
said
she
stayed
her
glance
a
second
to
note
involuntarily
how
well
they
went
together
eleanor
with
her
white
shoulders
rising
from
a
cloud
of
gauze
looked
fair
and
distinguished
and
sybert
with
his
dark
face
and
sullen
eyes
made
an
esthetically
satisfying
contrast
he
was
bending
toward
her
with
that
air
of
easy
politeness
that
superior
which
had
always
exasperated
marcia
so
but
eleanor
knew
how
to
take
it
she
had
been
out
nine
seasons
and
the
smile
with
which
she
answered
him
was
quite
as
mocking
as
his
own
he
looked
through
and
through
what
marcia
had
always
taken
him
finished
but
he
was
not
just
that
she
knew
she
had
seen
him
off
his
guard
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
that
afternoon
and
she
was
still
tingling
with
the
surprise
of
it
she
recalled
what
melville
had
said
that
afternoon
in
the
ilex
was
always
recalling
what
people
said
about
sybert
the
things
seemed
to
stick
in
one
s
mind
he
was
a
subject
that
gave
rise
to
many
you
think
you
are
very
because
you
see
the
man
underneath
the
peasant
don
t
you
think
you
could
push
your
one
step
further
and
see
the
man
underneath
the
man
of
the
world
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
that
afternoon
it
seemed
now
as
if
his
air
of
super
civilization
were
only
a
mask
to
did
not
know
what
underneath
she
was
searching
for
an
apt
description
when
she
heard
the
young
frenchman
laughingly
inquire
mademoiselle
copley
un
peu
distraite
ce
soir
n
with
a
little
start
she
became
aware
that
some
one
had
asked
her
a
question
for
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
she
kept
her
eyes
at
her
end
of
the
table
and
exerted
herself
to
be
gracious
to
her
taciturn
companion
paul
s
bad
temper
was
not
unbecoming
and
he
scarcely
could
have
adopted
a
wiser
course
marcia
had
expected
to
find
him
sparkling
enthusiastic
convincing
and
she
had
come
down
prepared
to
withstand
his
charm
voilà
there
was
no
charm
to
withstand
he
was
sullen
moody
with
a
frown
scarcely
veiled
enough
for
politeness
some
one
had
once
compared
him
not
very
originally
to
a
greek
god
he
looked
it
more
than
ever
if
one
can
imagine
a
greek
god
in
the
sulks
what
was
the
matter
with
him
marcia
could
only
guess
perhaps
as
his
cousin
had
affirmed
he
was
like
a
cat
and
needed
stroking
the
right
way
of
the
fur
at
any
rate
she
found
the
new
mood
rather
taking
and
she
somewhat
weakly
allowed
herself
to
stroke
him
the
right
way
by
the
time
they
rose
from
the
table
he
was
if
not
exactly
purring
at
least
not
showing
his
claws
at
the
royston
girls
suggestion
they
put
on
evening
wraps
and
repaired
to
the
the
two
elder
ladies
who
preferred
the
more
tempered
atmosphere
of
the
salon
copley
delegated
her
husband
and
sybert
to
act
as
position
which
sybert
accepted
with
a
bow
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
slightly
puzzled
smile
on
eleanor
s
part
she
could
not
exactly
make
out
the
gentleman
s
footing
in
the
household
they
seated
themselves
in
a
group
about
the
balustrade
with
the
exception
of
eleanor
and
sybert
who
strolled
back
and
forth
the
length
of
the
flagging
eleanor
was
doing
her
best
and
her
best
was
very
good
she
appeared
to
have
wakened
a
spark
in
even
his
indifference
marcia
with
her
eyes
on
the
two
thought
again
how
well
they
went
together
and
benoit
was
a
second
time
on
the
verge
of
calling
her
the
two
strollers
after
a
time
joined
the
group
eleanor
humming
under
her
breath
a
little
french
that
had
been
going
the
rounds
of
the
paris
cafés
that
spring
oh
sing
something
we
all
know
said
margaret
and
with
a
laughing
curtesy
toward
sybert
she
struck
into
fair
the
other
girls
joined
her
their
voices
rising
high
and
clear
filled
the
night
with
the
swinging
melody
it
seemed
strangely
out
of
place
there
in
the
midst
of
the
sabine
hills
with
the
old
villa
behind
them
and
the
roman
campagna
at
their
feet
as
their
voices
died
away
sybert
laughed
softly
i
swear
i
d
forgotten
it
margaret
shook
her
head
in
mock
reproof
forgotten
it
she
cried
a
man
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
if
he
had
forgotten
his
alma
mater
song
it
s
like
forgetting
his
i
suspect
said
eleanor
that
it
s
time
for
you
to
go
back
to
america
and
be
naturalized
oh
well
miss
royston
he
objected
i
suppose
in
time
one
outgrows
his
college
just
as
one
outgrows
his
and
his
country
marcia
added
as
much
for
paul
dessart
s
benefit
as
for
his
own
margaret
searching
for
diversion
presently
suggested
that
they
visit
the
ghost
marcia
objected
that
the
ghost
was
visible
only
during
the
full
moon
but
the
objection
was
overruled
there
was
some
moon
at
least
and
a
wild
night
like
this
with
flying
clouds
and
waving
branches
was
just
the
time
for
a
ghost
to
think
of
his
sins
copley
in
the
office
of
chaperon
remonstrated
that
the
grass
would
be
damp
but
there
were
rubbers
he
was
told
marcia
acquiesced
in
the
expedition
without
any
marked
enthusiasm
she
foresaw
a
possible
with
paul
dessart
as
they
set
out
however
she
found
herself
walking
beside
benoit
with
paul
contentedly
strolling
on
ahead
at
the
side
of
his
younger
cousin
while
eleanor
and
the
two
chaperons
brought
up
the
rear
as
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
laurel
path
and
approached
the
region
of
the
ruins
margaret
paused
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
in
a
conspiratorial
whisper
impressed
silence
on
the
group
they
laughingly
fell
into
the
spirit
of
the
play
and
the
whole
party
stole
along
with
the
elaborate
caution
of
boys
ambuscading
indians
the
ruins
in
the
dim
light
looked
a
fit
harbour
for
ghosts
the
crumbling
piles
of
masonry
were
almost
hidden
by
the
dark
foliage
but
the
empty
fountain
stood
out
clearly
in
a
little
open
space
between
the
trees
the
group
paused
on
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
stood
with
eyes
turned
half
expectantly
toward
the
fountain
as
they
looked
they
saw
with
a
tremor
of
surprise
the
dim
figure
of
a
man
rise
from
the
coping
and
dissolve
into
the
surrounding
shadows
for
a
moment
no
one
uttered
a
sound
beyond
a
quick
gasp
of
astonishment
and
an
excited
giggle
from
margaret
royston
paul
was
the
first
to
rise
to
the
occasion
with
the
muffled
assertion
that
he
recognized
the
fair
and
warlike
form
in
which
the
majesty
of
buried
denmark
did
sometime
march
before
any
of
them
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
follow
the
apparition
a
second
ghost
rose
from
the
coping
and
stood
wavering
in
apparent
hesitancy
whether
to
recede
or
advance
this
was
more
than
tradition
demanded
and
with
a
quick
exclamation
both
copley
and
sybert
sprang
forward
to
solve
the
mystery
a
babble
of
noisy
expostulation
burst
forth
the
ghost
was
vociferous
in
his
apologies
he
had
finished
his
work
and
had
desired
to
take
the
air
it
was
a
beautiful
night
he
came
to
talk
with
a
friend
he
did
not
know
that
the
signore
ever
came
here
or
he
would
never
have
ventured
the
tones
were
familiar
and
a
little
sigh
of
disillusionment
swept
through
the
group
the
two
men
came
back
laughing
and
paul
apostrophized
tragically
another
lost
illusion
if
all
the
ghosts
turned
out
to
be
butlers
how
unromantic
the
world
would
be
the
young
frenchman
took
up
the
tale
of
mourning
but
the
true
ghost
monsieur
le
prince
whom
i
was
preparing
to
paint
after
this
he
will
not
deign
to
poke
his
nose
from
the
grave
it
is
an
infamy
an
infamy
he
declared
they
laughingly
turned
back
toward
the
villa
and
marcia
discovered
that
she
was
walking
beside
paul
it
had
come
about
quite
naturally
without
any
apparent
interposition
on
his
part
but
she
did
not
doubt
since
he
had
the
chance
that
he
would
take
advantage
of
it
to
demand
an
answer
and
she
prepared
herself
to
parry
what
he
might
choose
to
say
he
strolled
along
whistling
softly
apparently
in
no
hurry
to
say
anything
when
he
did
break
the
silence
it
was
to
remark
that
the
were
infernally
noisy
he
went
on
to
observe
that
he
wasn
t
particularly
taken
with
her
butler
the
fellow
protested
too
much
in
the
wrong
place
and
not
enough
in
the
right
from
that
he
passed
to
a
flying
criticism
of
villa
architecture
villa
vivalanti
was
a
daisy
except
for
the
eastern
wing
and
that
was
way
off
in
style
and
broke
the
lines
those
gingerbread
french
villas
at
frascati
he
thought
ought
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
by
act
of
parliament
marcia
responded
rather
lamely
to
his
remarks
as
she
puzzled
her
brains
to
think
whether
she
had
done
anything
to
offend
him
he
seemed
entirely
however
and
chatted
along
as
genially
as
the
first
time
they
had
met
she
could
not
comprehend
this
new
attitude
and
though
it
was
just
what
she
had
wished
is
the
contrariness
of
human
vaguely
resented
it
had
benoit
seen
her
just
then
he
might
have
accused
her
for
the
third
time
of
being
the
upon
their
return
shortly
retired
for
the
night
as
the
festa
at
genazzano
would
demand
an
early
start
before
going
upstairs
marcia
waited
to
give
orders
about
an
she
was
planning
for
the
morrow
in
searching
for
pietro
she
also
found
her
uncle
copley
very
stern
was
engaged
in
telling
the
butler
that
if
it
occurred
again
he
would
be
discharged
and
the
butler
very
humble
was
assuring
the
signore
that
in
the
future
his
commands
should
be
implicitly
obeyed
uncle
howard
marcia
remonstrated
you
surely
aren
t
scolding
the
poor
fellow
because
of
what
difference
does
it
make
if
he
does
entertain
his
friends
in
the
grounds
of
the
old
villa
we
never
go
near
the
it
is
this
particular
friend
i
am
objecting
who
was
it
gervasio
s
oh
you
don
t
suppose
she
cried
that
he
is
trying
to
steal
the
child
back
again
i
should
like
to
see
him
do
it
said
copley
with
decision
he
doesn
t
want
the
boy
he
added
what
he
wants
is
money
but
he
isn
t
going
to
get
any
i
won
t
have
him
hanging
about
the
place
and
the
servants
may
as
well
understand
it
first
as
marcia
having
outlined
her
plan
for
the
breakfast
to
a
somewhat
unresponsive
pietro
finally
gained
her
room
and
setting
her
candle
down
on
the
table
she
dropped
into
the
first
chair
she
came
to
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
evening
was
over
she
was
tired
not
only
in
body
but
in
mind
as
well
the
evening
was
not
quite
ended
however
a
gentle
tap
came
on
the
door
and
she
opened
it
to
find
eleanor
and
margaret
in
loose
silk
let
us
in
quick
said
margaret
we
ve
just
met
a
man
in
the
the
ubiquitous
pietro
shutting
up
windows
added
eleanor
if
i
were
you
i
d
discharge
that
man
and
get
a
more
companionable
butler
it
s
uncanny
for
an
italian
servant
to
be
as
grave
as
an
english
poor
pietro
has
just
had
a
scolding
which
i
suppose
accounts
for
his
gravity
it
s
funny
she
added
that
s
exactly
the
advice
that
paul
gave
me
the
paul
was
out
before
she
could
catch
it
and
she
reddened
apprehensively
but
the
girls
let
it
pass
without
challenging
we
ve
come
to
talk
said
margaret
possessing
herself
of
the
couch
and
settling
the
cushions
behind
her
i
hope
you
re
not
said
marcia
but
i
dare
say
i
shan
t
be
ten
minutes
from
you
needn
t
worry
this
isn
t
going
to
be
an
session
drawled
eleanor
from
the
lazy
depths
of
an
we
start
at
nine
for
the
madonna
s
you
d
better
appreciate
us
now
that
you
ve
got
us
added
margaret
we
should
by
rights
have
slept
in
rome
how
did
you
manage
it
paul
took
mamma
down
to
the
forum
to
look
at
some
inscriptions
they
ve
just
dug
up
and
while
she
was
gone
eleanor
and
i
scrambled
around
and
packed
the
trunks
for
perugia
by
the
time
she
came
back
we
had
everything
ready
to
come
out
here
and
our
hats
on
waiting
to
start
she
didn
t
recover
her
breath
until
we
were
in
the
train
and
then
she
couldn
t
say
anything
before
copley
when
it
comes
to
starting
on
journeys
margaret
added
mamma
is
not
what
you
d
call
not
often
assented
eleanor
but
there
have
been
instances
by
the
way
she
added
i
wish
you
d
explain
about
sybert
i
confess
i
don
t
quite
grasp
his
standing
in
the
family
how
do
you
come
to
be
taking
such
lengthy
horseback
rides
with
a
young
man
and
no
groom
you
never
did
that
when
my
mother
was
chaperoning
no
acquiesced
marcia
i
didn
t
but
sybert
s
a
little
different
he
s
not
exactly
a
young
man
you
know
he
s
a
friend
of
uncle
howard
s
he
happened
to
be
available
this
afternoon
and
angelo
didn
t
happen
to
be
so
he
came
as
a
sort
of
eleanor
asked
i
should
think
he
might
object
to
the
he
couldn
t
help
himself
she
laughed
aunt
katherine
forced
him
into
eleanor
regarded
marcia
with
a
still
puzzled
smile
you
talk
about
sybert
as
if
he
were
a
contemporary
of
your
grandfather
how
old
is
he
may
i
ask
i
don
t
know
he
s
nearly
as
old
as
uncle
howard
or
i
should
a
man
isn
t
worth
talking
to
under
oh
nonsense
margaret
objected
i
never
heard
any
one
in
my
life
talk
better
than
paul
and
he
s
exactly
paul
talks
words
he
doesn
t
talk
ideas
said
her
sister
there
was
a
pause
in
which
eleanor
leaned
forward
to
examine
some
bits
of
green
and
blue
iridescent
glass
lying
in
a
little
tray
on
the
table
what
are
these
she
inquired
pieces
of
that
the
in
palestrina
found
in
an
old
etruscan
tomb
there
were
some
bronze
mirrors
and
the
most
wonderful
gold
wanted
it
dreadfully
but
he
didn
t
dare
sell
it
it
s
gone
to
a
museum
in
rome
aren
t
these
pieces
of
glass
lovely
though
i
am
going
to
have
them
set
in
gold
and
made
into
here
s
a
little
bottle
that
s
scarcely
eleanor
held
it
up
before
the
candle
and
let
the
light
play
upon
its
surface
who
do
you
suppose
owned
it
before
you
marcia
some
girl
who
turned
to
dust
centuries
and
her
necklaces
and
mirrors
and
still
exist
what
a
commentary
thank
goodness
they
don
t
put
such
things
in
one
s
coffin
nowadays
said
marcia
or
hundred
years
from
now
some
other
girl
would
be
saying
the
same
of
hundred
years
eleanor
murmured
i
declare
my
nine
seasons
sink
into
insignificance
she
dropped
the
bottle
into
its
tray
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
a
little
laugh
america
is
a
bit
tame
isn
t
it
after
italy
one
doesn
t
get
so
many
i
m
not
sure
but
one
gets
too
many
in
italy
said
marcia
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
over
i
don
t
know
it
s
so
much
easier
not
to
make
up
one
s
mind
i
shall
probably
stay
a
year
or
so
longer
with
uncle
i
like
your
uncle
marcia
he
has
a
very
taking
way
of
saying
funny
things
without
ah
sighed
marcia
he
has
and
as
for
margaret
put
in
mockingly
i
think
he
s
about
the
most
interesting
man
i
ve
met
in
europe
eleanor
agreed
imperturbably
the
most
interesting
man
you
ve
met
in
europe
marcia
opened
her
eyes
the
statement
was
sweeping
and
eleanor
had
had
experience
how
do
you
mean
she
asked
well
said
eleanor
with
the
judicial
air
of
a
connoisseur
for
one
thing
he
has
a
striking
face
i
don
t
know
whether
you
ever
noticed
it
but
he
has
eyes
exactly
like
that
portrait
of
filippino
lippi
in
the
uffizi
i
kept
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
i
was
talking
to
sort
of
italian
eyes
you
an
american
mouth
it
makes
an
interesting
combination
you
keep
wondering
what
a
man
like
that
will
as
marcia
made
no
comment
she
continued
he
has
an
awfully
interesting
history
we
met
him
at
a
reception
last
week
and
melville
told
me
all
about
him
afterward
he
was
born
in
father
was
united
states
he
was
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
during
the
fight
for
italian
unity
politics
was
in
the
air
he
breathed
he
knows
more
about
the
italians
than
they
know
about
themselves
he
speaks
the
language
like
a
native
and
he
oh
i
know
what
melville
told
you
marcia
interrupted
he
likes
don
t
most
people
ask
your
cousin
about
him
ask
carthrope
the
english
sculptor
ask
anybody
you
my
see
what
you
ll
what
shall
i
hear
a
different
story
from
every
well
really
he
s
worth
i
detest
him
marcia
made
the
statement
as
much
from
habit
as
conviction
eleanor
regarded
her
a
moment
rather
narrowly
and
then
she
observed
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
marcia
copley
and
that
is
that
interesting
men
are
mighty
scarce
in
this
world
i
don
t
remember
ever
having
met
more
than
half
a
and
you
ve
had
experience
suggested
marcia
nine
who
were
one
was
a
kansas
politician
who
wrote
poetry
a
most
amazing
mixture
of
crudeness
and
bright
in
some
ways
but
unexpectedly
lacking
in
others
he
d
never
read
said
he
d
heard
of
it
though
another
was
a
russian
i
met
him
in
cairo
he
spoke
seven
languages
and
didn
t
find
any
of
them
full
enough
to
express
his
thoughts
another
the
engineer
suggested
marcia
she
had
heard
of
the
engineer
both
from
eleanor
and
her
mother
yes
agreed
eleanor
the
chief
engineer
on
the
claytons
yacht
i
cruised
around
with
them
two
years
ago
on
the
mediterranean
and
the
only
interesting
man
on
board
was
the
engineer
he
was
english
and
he
d
lived
in
india
and
burma
and
hundreds
of
nameless
places
i
couldn
t
get
much
out
of
him
at
first
he
was
pretty
shy
english
people
are
you
know
but
when
he
saw
that
one
was
really
interested
he
would
tell
the
most
astonishing
tales
i
didn
t
have
much
chance
to
talk
to
didn
t
appeal
to
mamma
that
was
one
of
the
times
that
mamma
was
impetuous
she
added
with
a
laugh
instead
of
keeping
on
to
port
said
with
the
boat
we
disembarked
at
alexandria
and
ran
up
to
cairo
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
it
was
there
i
met
the
russian
he
was
stopping
at
eleanor
paused
and
her
gaze
became
reminiscent
as
she
sat
toying
with
the
little
etruscan
and
the
others
marcia
prompted
well
let
me
see
eleanor
laughed
i
once
knew
a
professor
of
psychology
in
a
little
speck
of
a
new
england
college
he
spent
his
whole
life
in
thinking
and
he
d
arrived
at
some
very
queer
conclusions
he
was
most
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
a
shade
of
something
like
remorse
crossed
her
face
and
she
hastily
abandoned
the
professor
did
i
say
there
were
any
more
i
can
t
think
who
the
fifth
can
be
unless
i
include
the
blacksmith
who
married
my
maid
i
never
knew
him
personally
i
merely
judge
from
her
report
of
him
he
beats
her
i
believe
when
he
gets
angry
but
he
s
so
apologetic
afterward
that
she
enjoys
it
if
you
ve
ever
read
he
s
exactly
like
heathcliff
i
d
really
like
to
know
him
he
d
be
worth
that
s
the
trouble
complained
marcia
if
you
re
a
man
you
can
go
around
and
get
acquainted
with
any
one
you
please
whether
he
s
a
blacksmith
or
a
prince
but
if
you
re
a
girl
you
have
to
wait
till
you
re
introduced
at
a
tea
and
the
interesting
ones
never
are
introduced
at
yes
agreed
eleanor
that
s
partly
true
but
on
the
other
hand
i
think
you
really
get
to
know
people
better
if
you
re
a
they
re
really
like
inside
i
mean
men
are
remarkably
confidential
did
you
find
sybert
confidential
i
can
t
say
that
i
did
he
s
queer
isn
t
he
you
have
the
feeling
that
he
doesn
t
talk
about
what
he
thinks
s
why
i
should
like
to
know
him
it
s
not
what
a
man
does
that
makes
him
interesting
it
s
what
he
thinks
it
s
his
margaret
rose
with
something
of
a
yawn
if
you
re
going
to
discuss
potentialities
i
m
going
to
bed
come
on
eleanor
s
the
festa
of
our
lady
of
good
counsel
and
we
start
at
nine
o
eleanor
rose
reluctantly
i
wish
we
weren
t
going
to
perugia
on
wednesday
i
should
much
rather
stay
here
with
and
sybert
margaret
laughed
oh
yes
sybert
eleanor
acquiesced
he
annoys
you
until
you
get
him
he
s
like
one
of
those
problems
in
algebra
suggested
marcia
given
a
lot
of
things
to
find
the
value
of
x
you
work
it
exactly
right
and
x
won
t
margaret
paused
by
the
door
and
gathered
her
wrapper
around
her
like
a
toga
while
you
re
talking
about
interesting
people
she
threw
back
i
know
one
who
isn
t
appreciated
and
that
s
paul
he
s
a
mighty
nice
that
s
just
what
he
is
said
eleanor
a
nice
c
est
good
night
marcia
when
we
come
back
from
perugia
we
ll
sit
up
all
night
talking
about
interesting
men
it
s
an
interesting
chapter
xv
villa
vivalanti
was
astir
early
in
the
that
is
for
the
villa
castel
vivalanti
had
been
at
work
two
hours
and
more
when
pietro
went
the
rounds
of
the
bedroom
doors
with
his
very
obsequious
excellency
if
it
suits
your
convenience
coffee
will
be
served
in
the
ilex
grove
in
half
an
coffee
in
the
ilex
grove
was
a
new
departure
in
accordance
with
marcia
s
inspiration
of
the
night
before
and
the
ilex
grove
as
bianca
exclaimed
with
clasped
hands
reminded
one
of
paradise
the
week
of
rain
had
left
it
a
study
in
green
the
deep
rich
tone
of
ilex
leaves
arching
overhead
the
blue
green
moss
on
dark
tree
trunks
the
tender
tint
of
young
grass
sprouting
in
the
paths
and
the
yellow
flickering
sunlight
glancing
everywhere
out
on
the
terrace
the
peacock
was
trailing
his
feathers
over
the
marble
pavement
with
a
conscious
air
of
being
in
tune
with
the
day
marcia
was
first
to
appear
she
stepped
on
to
the
loggia
with
a
little
exclamation
of
delight
at
the
beauty
of
the
morning
in
a
pale
summer
gown
her
hair
burnished
by
the
sun
she
herself
was
not
out
of
touch
with
the
scene
she
crossed
the
terrace
and
stood
by
the
balustrade
looking
off
through
a
golden
and
purple
haze
to
the
speck
on
the
horizon
of
rome
and
peter
s
the
peacock
called
her
back
strutting
insistently
with
tail
you
ridiculous
bird
she
laughed
i
suppose
you
have
been
posing
here
for
two
hours
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
and
admire
and
she
hurried
off
to
the
grove
to
make
sure
that
pietro
had
carried
out
her
orders
the
table
was
spread
by
the
fountain
where
the
green
arched
paths
converged
and
the
ilexes
grew
in
an
open
circle
the
sunlight
flickering
through
on
dainty
linen
and
silver
and
glass
and
on
little
cakes
of
golden
from
a
farm
in
the
alban
a
feast
which
would
not
have
been
out
of
place
in
a
watteau
painting
marcia
echoed
bianca
s
enthusiasm
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
scene
and
pietro
flew
about
with
an
unprecedented
ardour
placing
rugs
and
cushions
and
wicker
chairs
it
is
perfect
she
cried
as
she
retreated
down
one
of
the
paths
to
get
a
perspective
but
there
are
no
flowers
she
added
that
will
never
do
we
must
have
some
pietro
you
fix
a
bowl
in
the
centre
while
i
run
and
pick
them
and
she
started
off
toward
the
garden
borders
here
paul
dessart
found
her
five
minutes
later
he
greeted
her
with
a
friendly
signorina
the
transient
clouds
of
yesterday
had
disappeared
from
his
brow
as
well
as
from
the
sky
and
he
joined
gaily
in
her
task
there
said
marcia
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
shook
back
the
stray
hair
from
her
eyes
could
anything
be
more
in
keeping
with
a
sylvan
breakfast
than
these
she
held
at
arm
s
length
for
him
to
admire
a
great
bunch
of
delicate
transparent
bells
sheathed
in
glistening
green
come
she
cried
the
artist
must
arrange
them
and
together
they
turned
toward
the
fountain
a
spray
of
bluest
hung
over
one
of
the
garden
borders
the
young
man
stooped
and
breaking
it
presented
it
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
signorina
he
begged
in
a
tone
of
dearest
signorina
i
am
going
where
duty
far
away
to
perugia
she
laughed
as
she
put
the
flowers
in
her
belt
but
with
a
slightly
deeper
tinge
on
her
cheek
paul
in
a
mood
like
this
was
very
attractive
as
they
entered
the
grove
they
heard
the
prattle
of
childish
voices
and
presently
gerald
and
gervasio
appeared
down
the
walk
carrying
each
a
saucer
of
crumbs
for
their
scaly
friends
of
the
fountain
they
stopped
with
big
eyes
at
the
sight
of
the
table
spread
for
breakfast
oh
cousin
marcia
gerald
squealed
delightedly
are
we
doin
to
eat
out
uv
doors
may
gervas
an
me
eat
wif
you
please
please
marcia
feigned
to
consider
yes
said
she
finally
this
is
my
party
and
if
you
ll
be
good
boys
and
not
talk
i
ll
invite
you
and
when
you
ve
finished
your
bread
and
milk
if
you
ve
been
good
you
may
have
she
paused
and
lowered
her
voice
dramatically
while
the
two
hung
upon
her
honey
paul
dessart
laughed
at
what
struck
him
as
an
anticlimax
but
the
boys
received
the
assurance
with
acclamation
gervasio
was
presented
to
the
young
painter
and
he
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
grace
equal
to
gerald
s
own
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
he
was
not
born
a
prince
as
gerald
shook
hands
he
invited
the
guest
with
visible
hesitancy
to
throw
the
crumbs
but
paul
generously
refused
the
invitation
and
two
minutes
later
the
little
fellows
were
kneeling
side
by
side
on
the
coping
of
the
fountain
while
the
arching
pathways
rang
with
their
laughter
the
rest
of
their
excellencies
soon
appeared
in
a
humour
to
fit
the
morning
and
the
usually
uneventful
first
breakfast
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
fête
gerald
s
and
gervasio
s
laughter
rang
free
and
unchecked
the
two
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
a
stone
the
bust
of
a
forgotten
emperor
brooding
over
them
engaged
for
the
present
with
twin
silver
bowls
of
bread
and
milk
but
with
speculative
eyes
turned
honeyward
the
ghost
of
overnight
was
resurrected
and
jeered
at
while
the
ghost
himself
gravely
passed
the
cups
the
sedately
stepping
peacock
who
had
joined
the
feast
uninvited
became
the
point
of
many
morals
as
he
lowered
his
feathers
in
the
dust
to
scramble
for
crumbs
before
the
party
ended
sybert
and
dessart
engaged
in
a
bout
on
sybert
s
theme
of
yesterday
concerning
italy
s
baneful
beauty
paul
has
missed
his
calling
declared
eleanor
royston
he
should
have
been
a
ward
politician
in
new
york
it
is
a
pity
to
see
such
a
gift
for
impromptu
eloquence
wasted
in
private
for
a
time
paul
subsided
but
their
controversy
closed
with
the
laugh
on
his
side
apropos
of
riots
his
thesis
was
that
they
were
on
the
whole
very
jolly
and
he
upheld
this
shockingly
barbaric
view
with
the
plea
that
he
always
liked
to
see
people
having
a
good
time
and
that
next
to
sleeping
in
the
sun
and
eating
macaroni
the
italians
were
never
so
happy
as
when
engaged
in
a
row
for
his
part
he
affirmed
he
expected
to
find
them
tearing
up
the
golden
of
paradise
to
heave
at
each
other
the
image
wrung
a
smile
from
even
sybert
s
gravity
it
contained
just
enough
of
truth
and
not
too
much
to
make
it
funny
pietro
s
announcement
at
this
point
that
the
carriages
were
ready
to
drive
their
excellencies
to
the
festa
dissolved
the
party
in
a
scurry
for
hats
and
wraps
sybert
at
first
had
declined
the
festa
on
the
plea
that
he
had
business
in
rome
marcia
had
accepted
his
excuse
with
the
simply
polite
statement
that
they
would
be
sorry
not
to
have
him
but
eleanor
royston
had
refused
to
let
him
off
i
ve
known
a
great
many
diplomats
she
affirmed
and
though
they
are
supposed
to
be
engaged
with
the
business
of
nations
i
have
never
yet
seen
one
who
was
too
busy
to
attend
a
party
we
shan
t
let
you
off
on
that
somewhat
to
paul
s
secret
annoyance
and
not
entirely
to
marcia
s
gratification
he
finally
consented
to
change
his
mind
as
the
carriage
started
marcia
glanced
back
toward
the
loggia
steps
where
the
two
little
boys
one
with
yellow
curls
and
one
with
black
were
standing
hand
in
hand
wistfully
watching
the
departure
gerald
and
gervasio
she
called
if
you
are
very
good
i
ll
bring
you
something
nice
from
the
the
copley
pilgrimage
was
not
the
only
one
bound
for
genazzano
that
day
they
passed
on
the
road
countless
bands
of
contadini
both
on
foot
and
on
journeying
toward
the
festa
their
babies
and
provisions
in
baskets
on
their
heads
genazzano
on
st
mark
s
day
wisely
unites
pleasure
and
piety
with
masses
in
the
cathedral
and
jugglers
in
the
piazza
the
party
from
the
villa
devoted
the
larger
share
of
their
time
to
the
piazza
laughing
at
the
inglese
which
was
shouted
after
them
at
every
turn
they
lunched
on
the
terrace
of
the
very
modest
village
inn
in
company
with
a
jovial
party
of
young
irish
students
from
the
propaganda
who
seemed
to
treat
the
miracles
of
the
madonna
in
the
light
of
an
ecclesiastical
joke
the
afternoon
found
the
ardour
of
the
two
elder
ladies
somewhat
damped
there
was
to
be
a
function
in
the
cathedral
at
three
and
they
stated
their
intention
of
stopping
quietly
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
until
it
should
commence
eleanor
royston
issued
a
frank
invitation
to
sybert
to
explore
the
old
colonna
castle
which
surmounted
the
town
and
he
accepted
with
what
struck
marcia
as
a
flattering
show
of
interest
in
regard
to
laurence
sybert
she
herself
was
of
many
minds
a
very
considerable
amount
of
her
old
antagonism
for
him
remained
mixed
with
a
curiosity
and
interest
in
his
movements
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
interest
he
had
ever
expended
upon
her
and
she
was
experiencing
a
fresh
resentment
in
the
feeling
that
his
attitude
toward
eleanor
was
more
deferential
than
toward
herself
it
was
a
venturesome
act
for
any
man
to
awaken
marcia
s
pique
meanwhile
she
had
paul
and
the
slight
cloud
upon
her
brow
vanished
quickly
as
she
and
margaret
and
the
young
man
turned
toward
the
piazza
paul
was
in
holiday
humour
and
the
contagion
of
his
fun
was
impossible
to
escape
he
wore
a
favour
in
his
hat
and
a
gilt
medal
of
the
madonna
in
his
buttonhole
he
laughed
and
joked
with
the
people
in
the
booths
he
offered
his
assistance
to
a
prestidigitator
who
called
for
volunteers
he
shot
dolls
with
an
and
carried
off
the
prize
a
gaudily
decorated
pipe
which
he
presented
with
a
courtly
bow
to
a
pretty
peasant
girl
who
with
frank
admiration
had
applauded
the
feat
finally
he
brought
to
a
triumphant
close
a
bargain
of
marcia
s
she
had
expressed
a
desire
for
a
peculiar
style
of
long
silver
pin
with
a
closed
fist
on
the
by
the
women
from
the
volscian
villages
paul
readily
agreed
to
acquire
one
for
her
the
was
plucked
from
an
astonished
woman
s
head
and
the
bargaining
began
sell
it
but
that
was
impossible
it
was
an
heirloom
it
had
been
in
the
family
for
many
generations
she
could
not
think
of
parting
with
perhaps
for
its
weight
in
silver
money
was
jingled
before
her
eyes
she
wavered
visibly
paul
demanded
scales
they
were
brought
from
the
the
tobacconist
importantly
presiding
the
was
placed
on
one
side
lire
on
the
the
woman
clasped
her
hands
ecstatically
as
the
pile
grew
scales
hesitated
at
eleven
they
went
down
with
a
thud
and
the
bargain
was
completed
a
pleased
murmur
rippled
through
the
crowd
and
some
one
suggested
now
is
the
signorina
for
according
to
volscian
etiquette
only
married
woman
might
wear
the
marcia
shook
her
head
with
a
laugh
she
and
paul
standing
side
by
side
made
an
effective
couple
and
the
peasants
noted
it
with
pleased
appreciation
italians
are
quick
to
sympathize
with
a
romance
some
one
murmured
this
time
with
an
accent
of
delighted
assurance
paul
cast
a
sidewise
glance
at
marcia
to
see
how
she
would
accept
this
somewhat
public
betrothal
she
repudiated
the
charge
again
but
with
a
slightly
heightened
colour
and
the
crowd
laughed
gaily
as
the
two
turned
up
the
steep
street
toward
the
cathedral
paul
held
out
his
hand
give
me
the
pin
he
said
i
will
carry
it
in
my
pocket
for
you
since
you
are
not
wear
marcia
handed
it
over
trying
not
to
look
conscious
of
the
undertone
in
his
voice
he
was
very
convincing
she
was
reconsidering
her
problem
in
the
crowded
little
piazza
before
the
cathedral
they
found
the
rest
of
the
party
they
all
mounted
the
steps
and
stood
in
a
group
watching
the
processions
of
pilgrims
with
votive
offerings
they
came
in
bands
of
fifty
and
a
hundred
bearing
banners
and
chanting
litanies
as
they
approached
the
church
they
broke
off
their
singing
to
shout
ave
marias
mounting
on
their
knees
and
kissing
the
steps
as
they
came
marcia
looking
down
over
the
tossing
mass
of
scarlet
and
yellow
kerchiefs
compared
it
with
the
great
function
she
had
witnessed
in
peter
s
these
peasants
approaching
the
madonna
s
shrine
on
their
knees
shouting
themselves
hoarse
their
faces
glowing
with
religious
ardour
were
to
her
mind
far
the
more
impressive
sight
of
the
two
she
turned
into
the
church
half
carried
away
by
the
movement
and
colour
and
intensity
of
the
scene
there
was
something
contagious
about
the
simple
energy
of
their
devotion
the
interior
was
packed
with
closely
kneeling
peasants
the
air
filled
with
a
blue
haze
of
incense
through
which
the
candles
on
the
altar
glowed
dimly
the
copley
party
wedged
their
way
through
and
stood
back
at
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
side
chapels
watching
the
scene
paul
dropped
on
his
knees
with
the
peasants
and
in
hand
set
himself
surreptitiously
to
copying
the
head
of
a
girl
in
front
marcia
watched
him
for
a
few
moments
with
an
amused
smile
then
she
glanced
away
over
the
sea
of
kneeling
figures
there
was
no
mechanical
devotion
here
it
came
from
the
heart
if
any
ever
did
ah
they
were
too
believing
she
thought
suddenly
their
piety
carried
them
too
far
it
robbed
them
of
dignity
of
individuality
of
almost
at
her
feet
a
woman
was
prostrate
on
the
floor
kissing
the
stones
of
the
pavement
in
a
frenzy
of
devotion
she
turned
away
in
a
quick
revulsion
of
feeling
such
as
she
had
experienced
in
peter
s
and
as
she
turned
her
eyes
met
laurence
sybert
s
fixed
upon
her
face
he
was
standing
just
behind
her
and
he
bent
over
and
whispered
you
ve
seen
enough
of
this
come
let
s
get
out
and
he
made
a
motion
toward
the
sacristy
entrance
behind
them
they
stepped
back
and
the
crowd
closed
into
their
places
out
in
the
piazza
he
squared
his
shoulders
with
a
little
laugh
the
church
must
make
itself
over
a
bit
before
i
shall
be
ready
to
be
received
into
the
fold
how
about
you
miss
marcia
it
seemed
so
beautiful
their
simple
faith
and
then
horrible
you
realize
the
ignorance
and
superstition
underneath
everything
is
alike
she
added
just
as
you
begin
to
think
how
beautiful
it
is
you
catch
a
glimpse
below
the
surface
it
s
awful
to
begin
seeing
hidden
meanings
you
can
never
look
at
that
he
laughed
nodding
toward
a
house
where
a
pig
was
stretched
asleep
in
the
doorway
he
s
evidently
been
left
to
keep
guard
while
the
family
are
at
the
festa
i
suppose
you
ve
noticed
that
every
house
is
genazzano
has
a
separate
door
for
the
chickens
cut
in
the
bottom
of
the
big
door
it
s
rather
funny
isn
t
it
marcia
regarded
the
pig
with
a
laugh
and
a
sigh
yes
it
s
funny
but
then
the
first
thing
you
know
you
begin
to
think
what
a
low
standard
of
life
the
people
must
have
who
keep
their
pigs
and
their
chickens
in
the
house
with
them
and
it
doesn
t
seem
funny
any
ah
he
said
you
re
coming
i
m
afraid
i
am
she
agreed
as
they
strolled
toward
the
upper
part
of
the
town
they
came
upon
a
group
of
men
and
boys
talking
and
smoking
and
throwing
dice
in
a
prolonged
noonday
rest
it
was
a
part
of
the
pilgrimage
from
the
village
of
castel
vivalanti
and
the
group
instantly
recognized
marcia
the
festal
spirit
of
the
day
joined
to
a
double
portion
of
wine
had
made
them
more
boisterous
than
usual
and
one
ragged
little
urchin
who
had
been
playing
the
part
of
buffoon
for
the
crowd
fell
upon
the
two
signori
as
a
fresh
subject
for
pleasantries
he
set
up
the
usual
beggar
s
whine
asking
for
soldi
the
two
paying
no
attention
he
changed
the
form
of
his
petition
signorina
he
implored
running
along
at
marcia
s
side
and
keeping
a
dirty
hand
extended
impudently
in
front
of
her
i
have
hunger
signorina
i
have
hunger
spare
me
for
the
love
of
god
a
few
grains
of
that
s
a
new
formula
marcia
laughed
it
s
usually
bread
they
want
i
never
heard
them
ask
for
wheat
sybert
turned
on
the
boy
with
an
air
of
threatening
and
he
hastily
scrambled
out
of
reach
though
he
still
persevered
in
his
petition
to
the
noisy
amusement
of
the
crowd
marcia
spread
out
empty
hands
i
have
no
wheat
she
said
with
a
shake
of
her
head
the
youngster
turned
to
his
following
mimicking
her
the
signorina
has
no
wheat
he
cried
will
no
one
give
to
the
signorina
she
is
poor
and
she
has
some
one
tossed
a
soldo
the
boy
pounced
upon
it
and
extended
it
toward
her
behold
signorina
this
good
man
is
poor
but
he
is
generous
he
offers
you
money
to
get
some
marcia
laughed
at
the
play
in
thorough
enjoyment
while
sybert
with
an
angry
light
in
his
eye
seized
the
boy
by
the
collar
and
cuffed
him
soundly
mr
sybert
she
cried
take
care
you
ll
hurt
him
i
mean
to
hurt
him
he
said
grimly
as
with
a
final
cuff
he
dropped
him
over
the
side
of
the
bank
the
crowd
jeered
at
his
downfall
as
loudly
as
they
had
jeered
at
his
impudence
and
the
two
turned
a
corner
and
left
them
behind
you
needn
t
have
struck
him
marcia
said
the
boy
didn
t
mean
anything
beyond
being
funny
he
is
one
of
my
best
friends
his
name
is
beppo
and
he
lives
next
door
to
the
baker
s
if
that
is
a
specimen
of
your
friends
sybert
answered
dryly
my
advice
is
that
you
shake
their
i
don
t
mind
a
little
impertinence
she
said
lightly
it
s
at
least
better
than
i
told
you
yesterday
miss
marcia
that
i
didn
t
think
you
ought
to
be
running
about
the
country
think
it
even
less
it
isn
t
safe
up
here
in
the
mountain
towns
where
the
people
aren
t
used
to
why
don
t
you
suggest
to
uncle
howard
that
he
engage
a
nurse
for
me
i
begin
to
think
you
need
one
marcia
laid
a
light
hand
on
his
arm
mr
sybert
please
don
t
speak
to
me
so
i
ll
speak
to
your
s
what
i
ll
do
he
retorted
they
had
by
this
time
reached
the
castle
and
having
crossed
the
drawbridge
and
the
stone
courtyard
they
came
out
on
the
other
side
with
the
noisy
little
town
left
suddenly
behind
the
mountains
rose
above
them
the
valley
lay
beneath
and
before
them
a
straight
grassy
road
stretched
into
the
hills
bordered
by
the
tall
arches
of
an
old
aqueduct
they
strolled
along
talking
idly
marcia
well
in
command
of
the
situation
there
was
a
touch
of
audacity
even
of
provocation
underneath
her
glance
and
sybert
was
amusedly
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
being
flirted
with
quite
to
marcia
s
astonishment
he
met
her
on
her
own
ground
he
accepted
the
in
her
manner
and
was
never
the
first
to
lower
his
eyes
they
had
come
to
a
bank
starred
pink
with
cyclamen
and
backed
by
one
of
the
tall
arches
of
the
aqueduct
suppose
we
sit
down
and
look
at
the
view
he
suggested
marcia
seated
herself
on
a
projecting
block
of
masonry
while
sybert
lounged
on
the
grass
at
her
side
mr
melville
told
me
the
other
day
he
remarked
presently
that
he
remembers
having
seen
your
mother
when
she
was
a
little
marcia
nodded
and
laughed
he
told
me
about
says
she
was
the
worst
he
ever
it
was
a
very
pretty
picture
he
wonder
if
you
ever
rode
the
colts
bareback
my
mother
was
brought
up
on
a
southern
plantation
i
in
a
new
york
house
and
a
paris
weren
t
any
colts
to
and
your
mother
died
when
you
were
a
little
girl
when
i
was
ah
that
was
hard
he
said
with
quick
sympathy
she
glanced
up
in
half
surprise
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
heard
him
say
anything
so
kindly
and
the
convent
in
paris
he
asked
how
did
that
happen
some
one
suggested
it
to
my
father
and
i
suppose
it
struck
him
as
an
excellent
way
to
dispose
of
me
not
that
he
isn
t
an
appreciative
parent
she
added
quickly
in
response
to
an
expression
on
his
face
but
the
education
of
a
daughter
is
a
problem
to
a
business
i
should
think
it
might
be
he
agreed
and
how
did
the
convent
go
not
very
well
i
didn
t
learn
anything
but
prayers
and
french
and
i
was
dreadfully
and
then
oh
one
or
two
governesses
and
a
and
after
that
marcia
laughed
you
should
have
seen
my
father
when
i
suggested
the
college
he
clutched
at
the
idea
like
a
drowning
man
it
was
another
four
years
it
s
a
pity
he
remarked
that
the
french
method
of
marrying
one
s
daughter
offhand
as
soon
as
she
gets
out
of
school
doesn
t
prevail
in
i
really
did
feel
guilty
when
i
graduated
the
poor
man
looked
so
dazed
through
it
all
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
take
a
little
trip
into
venezuela
with
him
to
look
into
some
mines
it
would
have
been
fun
wouldn
t
it
she
asked
i
should
have
liked
to
but
being
charitable
you
declined
yes
and
having
another
plan
in
my
head
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
seen
uncle
howard
and
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
come
over
and
live
with
him
for
a
and
so
here
you
are
in
here
i
am
she
agreed
but
as
soon
as
papa
is
ready
to
settle
down
respectably
like
other
people
i
am
going
back
to
keep
house
for
him
and
i
shall
take
with
me
some
italian
furniture
and
some
nice
italian
servants
and
give
nice
little
italian
and
shall
you
invite
me
sometimes
drop
in
whenever
you
marcia
began
to
laugh
well
he
inquired
what
is
so
funny
to
be
talking
to
you
this
shouldn
t
have
issued
that
invitation
a
week
ago
you
couldn
t
help
yourself
yesterday
she
added
aunt
katherine
made
you
come
but
really
it
s
your
own
fault
is
that
the
impression
i
gave
you
i
am
afraid
i
must
have
very
bad
you
bad
she
agreed
you
hit
straight
he
laughed
no
he
added
presently
aunt
katherine
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
walk
if
you
care
to
know
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
wanted
to
come
yesterday
afternoon
i
took
a
ride
with
a
most
charming
young
woman
and
i
thought
i
d
like
to
renew
the
if
that
s
intended
for
a
compliment
it
s
of
a
very
doubtful
nature
you
have
known
this
same
charming
young
woman
for
the
last
three
months
and
have
never
shown
any
marked
desire
for
her
company
i
was
blind
but
i
have
been
made
to
he
commenced
rolling
a
cigarette
in
a
lazy
fashion
while
marcia
occupied
an
interval
of
silence
by
checking
the
progress
of
a
black
beetle
who
found
himself
on
the
stone
beside
her
and
who
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
somewhere
else
in
whichever
way
he
turned
a
mountain
of
a
green
leaf
sprang
up
in
his
path
he
ran
wildly
in
a
circle
vainly
seeking
an
outlet
his
six
little
legs
twittering
with
anxiety
sybert
stretched
out
a
sympathetic
hand
and
dropped
him
over
the
bank
to
a
place
of
safety
now
why
must
you
do
that
marcia
inquired
a
sense
of
ve
watched
too
many
women
playing
with
too
many
men
not
to
know
how
the
poor
beast
felt
his
progress
was
thwarted
at
every
turn
without
his
being
able
to
comprehend
any
underlying
motive
or
reason
or
it
was
good
for
him
she
affirmed
i
was
giving
him
a
new
widening
his
horizon
when
i
finally
let
him
go
he
would
have
been
so
thankful
to
think
of
the
danger
he
had
escaped
that
he
would
have
been
twice
as
happy
a
beetle
as
ever
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
sybert
agreed
marcia
watched
him
a
moment
speculatively
she
was
thinking
about
the
contessa
torrenieri
mr
sybert
she
suggested
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
should
like
to
know
about
i
can
think
of
nothing
in
my
past
that
ought
to
be
these
are
things
that
you
wouldn
t
tell
try
me
and
anything
i
choose
to
ask
i
am
at
your
have
you
ever
been
in
love
with
any
one
he
glanced
up
from
his
cigarette
with
an
amused
stare
what
s
confessional
oh
you
don
t
look
as
if
you
d
ever
done
such
a
foolish
thing
and
i
just
half
a
dozen
really
oh
i
dare
say
he
laughed
in
my
cub
days
i
used
to
interested
but
you
outgrew
it
it
would
be
a
rash
man
who
would
affirm
that
you
never
can
tell
what
s
waiting
for
you
around
the
next
she
would
have
liked
to
put
a
question
or
so
in
regard
to
the
contessa
but
instead
she
remarked
there
are
some
other
things
i
d
like
to
ask
i
m
not
so
sure
i
ll
answer
if
that
s
a
why
were
you
carrying
a
revolver
yesterday
you
strike
me
as
a
very
inquisitive
young
woman
miss
you
strike
me
as
a
very
mysterious
man
why
was
i
carrying
a
revolver
for
a
very
simple
reason
i
have
been
travelling
through
the
south
helping
to
quiet
the
rioters
and
as
that
is
not
a
popular
occupation
i
thought
it
wisest
to
go
armed
a
revolver
is
an
excellent
thing
with
which
to
persuade
people
though
in
all
probability
i
shall
never
have
any
occasion
to
use
it
i
hope
you
are
thank
you
said
marcia
not
that
i
believe
you
at
all
she
added
with
a
laugh
he
regarded
her
a
moment
with
a
slightly
perplexed
frown
what
on
earth
do
you
take
me
for
miss
marcia
an
anarchist
a
bandit
a
second
fra
diavolo
in
disguise
i
am
nothing
so
picturesque
i
assure
a
peaceful
private
citizen
of
the
united
how
do
you
come
to
know
the
baker
s
son
tarquinio
so
well
i
think
i
ve
answered
questions
enough
suppose
we
have
a
confession
from
you
miss
marcia
have
you
ever
been
in
love
marcia
rose
it
s
a
quarter
past
four
and
we
ought
to
be
going
back
the
roystons
have
to
catch
the
evening
train
into
chapter
xvi
marcia
drove
to
the
station
with
the
travellers
leaving
the
rest
of
the
party
to
return
to
the
villa
in
the
other
carriage
she
had
a
slight
feeling
of
compunction
in
regard
to
paul
and
it
made
her
more
responsive
to
his
nonsense
than
she
might
otherwise
have
been
in
the
rôle
of
cicerone
he
naïvely
explained
the
story
of
the
ruins
they
passed
on
the
way
and
the
entire
history
of
rome
from
romulus
and
remus
to
garibaldi
unfolded
itself
upon
that
stretch
of
dusty
road
marcia
gave
herself
up
gaily
enough
to
the
spirit
of
the
play
forgetting
for
the
time
any
troubling
questions
lurking
in
the
background
when
she
bade
him
she
smiled
back
half
laughingly
half
seriously
at
his
parting
repetition
of
the
morning
s
pretty
as
the
carriage
turned
homeward
she
smiled
to
herself
over
her
yesterday
s
state
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
paul
the
actuality
had
not
been
so
disconcerting
she
did
not
quite
comprehend
his
new
attitude
but
she
accepted
it
as
a
tacit
recognition
of
her
desire
to
let
matters
stand
and
was
grateful
she
felt
very
kindly
toward
him
this
evening
he
was
such
a
optimistic
young
fellow
and
even
supposing
he
were
too
ready
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
was
not
laurence
sybert
she
asked
herself
too
ready
also
to
look
on
the
dark
side
since
his
words
of
yesterday
in
the
old
she
had
felt
an
undertone
of
sadness
to
her
thoughts
which
she
vaguely
resented
as
she
rode
along
now
between
the
fresh
fields
glowing
in
the
soft
light
of
the
april
sunset
she
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
struggle
a
rebellion
going
on
within
her
own
nature
she
seemed
pulled
two
ways
the
beautiful
sunshiny
world
of
dreams
was
calling
to
her
and
paul
stood
at
the
careless
happy
out
his
hand
with
a
winning
smile
to
show
the
way
to
cytherea
but
deep
within
her
heart
she
felt
the
weight
of
the
real
world
which
means
misery
to
so
many
on
her
spirits
and
holding
her
back
and
in
the
background
she
saw
sybert
watching
her
with
folded
arms
and
a
making
no
move
either
to
lure
her
on
or
to
turn
her
watching
with
inscrutable
eyes
happiness
seemed
to
be
her
portion
why
could
she
not
accept
it
gladly
and
shut
her
eyes
to
all
else
if
she
once
commenced
seeing
the
misery
in
the
world
there
would
be
no
end
until
a
few
weeks
before
she
had
scarcely
realized
that
any
existed
outside
of
books
but
she
knew
it
now
she
had
seen
it
face
to
face
she
thought
of
the
crowded
squalid
little
houses
of
castel
vivalanti
of
the
women
who
went
out
at
sunrise
to
work
all
day
in
the
fields
of
the
hordes
of
children
only
half
fed
oh
yes
she
knew
now
that
there
was
misery
outside
of
books
but
she
asked
herself
with
an
almost
despairing
cry
why
need
she
know
since
she
could
do
nothing
to
help
since
she
was
not
to
blame
why
not
close
her
eyes
and
pretend
it
was
not
there
it
was
the
shrinking
cry
of
the
soul
that
for
the
first
time
has
tasted
of
knowledge
that
with
open
eyes
is
hesitating
on
the
threshold
of
the
real
world
with
a
longing
backward
glance
toward
the
unreal
world
of
dreams
but
in
life
there
is
no
going
back
knowledge
once
gained
may
not
be
cancelled
and
there
was
further
knowledge
waiting
for
marcia
not
very
far
ahead
two
little
boys
turning
somersaults
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
suddenly
recalled
to
her
mind
the
boys
at
the
villa
and
her
promise
to
bring
them
a
present
from
the
festa
not
once
had
she
thought
of
them
during
the
day
and
the
only
possible
present
now
was
the
inevitable
sweet
chocolate
of
castel
vivalanti
she
glanced
at
her
watch
there
was
still
an
hour
before
dinner
and
she
ordered
giovanni
to
drive
up
the
hill
to
the
town
giovanni
respectfully
begged
her
pardon
with
the
suggestion
that
the
horses
were
tired
they
had
had
a
long
journey
and
the
hill
was
steep
marcia
replied
with
a
touch
of
sharpness
that
the
horses
could
rest
all
day
they
wound
up
the
gradual
ascent
at
a
walk
in
company
with
the
procession
coming
home
for
the
night
it
was
a
sight
which
marcia
always
watched
with
fresh
interest
with
mattocks
on
their
shoulders
trudging
wearily
back
to
supper
and
bed
washerwomen
their
clothes
in
baskets
on
their
heads
calling
cheery
to
one
another
files
of
ragged
little
donkeys
laden
with
brush
sheep
and
pigs
and
goats
and
they
were
all
to
be
stowed
for
the
night
was
an
mystery
under
the
smiling
moons
of
the
porta
della
luna
the
carriage
came
to
a
halt
and
the
crowd
of
castel
vivalanti
boys
who
were
in
the
habit
of
scouring
the
highway
for
coppers
fell
upon
it
vociferously
marcia
had
exhausted
her
soldi
in
genazzano
and
with
a
laughing
shake
of
her
head
she
motioned
them
away
but
the
boys
would
not
be
shaken
off
they
swarmed
about
the
carriage
like
little
rats
shrilly
demanding
money
she
continued
to
shake
her
head
and
instantly
their
cries
were
transferred
to
the
taunts
of
the
afternoon
grano
grano
they
shouted
in
chorus
and
giovanni
raised
his
whip
and
drove
them
away
marcia
paused
with
her
foot
on
the
puzzling
over
this
new
cry
which
was
suddenly
assailing
her
at
every
turn
what
is
the
matter
giovanni
why
are
they
always
shouting
wheat
he
waved
his
whip
disdainfully
signorina
they
are
of
no
account
do
not
listen
to
their
they
were
the
same
children
to
whom
she
had
given
chocolate
not
many
days
before
they
forget
quickly
she
said
to
herself
perhaps
after
all
paul
was
right
and
beauty
is
their
strongest
the
ave
maria
was
ringing
as
she
turned
into
the
crooked
little
streets
and
the
town
was
buzzing
like
a
beehive
over
its
evening
affairs
copper
were
coming
home
from
the
well
blue
smoke
was
pouring
out
of
every
chimney
and
yellow
meal
was
being
sifted
outside
the
doors
owing
to
the
festa
the
streets
were
crowded
with
loungers
and
in
the
tiny
piazza
groups
of
men
were
gathered
about
the
door
of
the
arguing
and
quarrelling
and
gesticulating
in
their
excitable
italian
fashion
it
had
been
a
week
or
more
since
marcia
had
visited
the
village
and
now
as
she
threaded
her
way
through
the
crowd
it
struck
her
suddenly
that
the
people
s
usual
friendly
nods
were
a
trifle
churlish
she
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
group
after
group
fell
silent
and
turned
to
stare
after
her
as
the
passed
one
little
boy
shouted
grano
and
was
dragged
indoors
with
a
box
on
his
ears
mia
cried
his
anxious
mother
are
we
not
poor
enough
already
that
you
would
bring
down
foreign
curses
upon
the
house
in
the
domenico
served
her
surlily
answering
her
friendly
inquiries
as
to
the
health
of
his
family
and
the
progress
of
his
vineyard
with
grunts
rather
than
words
amazed
and
indignant
she
shrank
within
herself
and
with
head
erect
and
hotly
burning
cheeks
turned
back
toward
the
gate
not
so
much
as
glancing
at
the
people
who
silently
made
way
for
her
ah
you
see
they
murmured
to
one
another
the
foreign
signorina
played
at
having
a
kind
heart
for
amusement
but
what
does
she
care
for
our
no
more
than
for
the
stones
beneath
her
laurence
sybert
coming
out
from
the
village
was
somewhat
astonished
to
find
giovanni
drawn
up
before
the
gate
giovanni
hailed
him
with
an
anxious
air
signore
have
you
seen
the
signorina
she
is
he
nodded
toward
the
porta
she
has
gone
to
the
alone
i
told
her
the
horses
were
tired
but
she
paid
no
attention
and
the
called
wheat
but
she
did
not
they
shouted
wheat
did
they
signore
they
read
the
papers
the
sybert
nodded
i
know
what
the
he
turned
back
under
the
archway
and
set
out
for
the
baker
place
as
it
happened
from
which
he
had
just
come
he
had
been
entertained
there
with
some
very
plain
comments
on
his
friends
in
the
giovanni
suggested
they
read
their
papers
and
the
truth
of
whatever
was
stated
in
printer
s
ink
was
not
to
be
doubted
it
was
scarcely
the
time
that
marcia
should
have
chosen
for
an
evening
stroll
through
castel
vivalanti
and
sybert
was
provoked
that
she
should
have
paid
so
little
heed
to
his
warning
of
the
afternoon
the
fact
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
special
causes
for
his
warning
did
not
at
the
moment
present
itself
as
an
excuse
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
heard
shouts
ahead
the
words
were
unmistakable
wheat
wheat
signorina
wheat
the
volume
of
sound
sent
him
hurrying
forward
in
quick
anxiety
almost
fearing
a
riot
but
his
first
glance
as
he
came
out
into
the
piazza
showed
him
that
it
was
scarcely
as
serious
as
that
marcia
looking
hurt
and
astonished
and
angry
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
dirty
little
street
urchins
who
were
shrieking
and
jumping
and
gesticulating
about
her
she
was
in
no
possible
danger
however
the
boys
meant
no
harm
beyond
being
impudent
for
a
second
sybert
hesitated
with
the
grim
intention
of
teaching
her
a
lesson
but
the
next
moment
he
saw
that
she
was
already
thoroughly
frightened
she
called
out
wildly
to
a
group
of
men
who
had
paused
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
they
laughed
insolently
and
made
no
move
to
drive
the
boys
away
she
closed
her
eyes
and
swayed
slightly
while
sybert
in
quick
compunction
hurried
forward
pushing
into
the
midst
of
the
tumult
he
cuffed
the
boys
right
and
left
out
of
the
way
marcia
opened
her
eyes
and
regarded
him
dazedly
mr
sybert
she
gasped
what
s
the
matter
what
are
they
saying
can
you
walk
he
asked
stretching
out
a
hand
to
steady
her
come
we
ll
get
out
of
the
by
this
time
other
men
had
joined
the
crowd
and
low
mutterings
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
many
recognized
sybert
and
his
name
was
shouted
tauntingly
wheat
wheat
however
was
still
the
burden
of
the
cry
one
boy
jostled
against
them
was
beppo
of
the
sybert
struck
him
a
sharp
blow
across
the
shoulders
with
his
cane
sending
him
sprawling
on
the
pavement
half
the
crowd
laughed
half
called
angrily
hit
him
beppo
hit
him
don
t
let
him
knock
you
down
while
a
voice
in
the
rear
shouted
behold
signor
siberti
the
friend
of
the
poor
here
let
s
get
out
of
this
he
said
and
clearing
an
opening
with
a
vigorous
sweep
of
his
cane
he
hurried
her
down
a
narrow
alley
and
around
a
corner
out
of
sight
of
the
piazza
leading
the
way
into
a
little
he
drew
a
chair
forward
toward
the
door
giuseppe
he
called
bring
the
signorina
some
marcia
dropped
into
the
chair
and
leaned
her
head
on
the
back
she
felt
dazed
and
bewildered
never
before
had
she
been
treated
with
anything
but
friendliness
and
courtesy
why
had
the
people
suddenly
turned
against
her
what
had
she
done
that
they
should
hate
her
in
the
back
of
the
room
she
heard
sybert
explaining
something
in
a
low
tone
to
giuseppe
and
she
caught
the
words
she
does
not
she
does
not
know
the
woman
murmured
sybert
came
across
with
a
glass
of
wine
here
marcia
drink
this
he
said
peremptorily
she
received
the
glass
with
a
hand
that
trembled
and
took
one
or
two
swallows
and
then
set
it
down
it
s
nothing
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
moment
they
pressed
around
me
so
close
that
i
couldn
t
the
wine
brought
some
colour
back
to
her
face
and
after
a
few
minutes
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
m
sorry
to
have
made
so
much
commotion
i
feel
better
now
let
s
go
back
to
the
skirting
the
piazza
they
returned
to
the
porta
by
a
narrow
the
boys
behind
still
shouting
after
but
none
approaching
within
reach
of
sybert
s
stick
they
had
regained
the
carriage
and
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
before
either
of
them
spoke
marcia
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
what
is
it
sybert
that
i
don
t
know
a
good
many
things
apparently
he
said
coolly
for
one
you
don
t
know
how
to
take
a
piece
of
friendly
advice
i
told
you
this
afternoon
that
the
was
too
stirred
up
to
be
safe
and
i
think
you
might
have
paid
just
a
little
attention
to
my
warning
respectable
italian
girls
don
t
run
around
the
streets
alone
and
they
particularly
don
t
choose
the
evening
of
a
festa
for
a
solitary
if
you
have
quite
finished
sybert
will
you
answer
my
question
do
they
call
me
signorina
wheat
he
was
apparently
engaged
with
his
thoughts
and
did
not
hear
mr
sybert
i
asked
you
a
why
do
they
shout
wheat
his
tone
was
still
sharp
well
i
suppose
because
just
at
present
wheat
is
a
burning
question
in
italy
and
the
name
of
copley
is
somewhat
unpleasantly
connected
with
it
your
uncle
has
just
bought
a
large
consignment
of
american
wheat
which
is
on
its
way
to
italy
now
his
only
object
is
to
relieve
the
loses
on
every
bushel
he
as
is
usually
the
case
with
disinterested
people
his
motives
have
been
misjudged
the
newspapers
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
matter
and
the
people
with
their
usual
gratitude
toward
their
benefactors
have
turned
against
mr
sybert
you
are
not
telling
me
the
sybert
did
not
see
fit
to
answer
this
charge
he
folded
his
arms
and
leaned
against
the
cushions
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
two
brass
buttons
on
the
back
of
giovanni
s
coat
and
marcia
the
colour
back
in
her
cheeks
sat
staring
at
the
roadway
with
angry
eyes
neither
spoke
again
till
the
carriage
came
to
a
stand
before
the
loggia
well
miss
marcia
are
we
friends
said
sybert
no
said
marcia
we
are
she
turned
up
to
her
room
and
set
about
dressing
in
a
very
mingled
frame
of
mind
she
was
still
excited
and
hurt
from
her
treatment
in
the
very
much
puzzled
as
to
its
motive
she
was
indignant
at
sybert
s
attitude
at
his
presuming
to
issue
orders
with
no
reason
attached
and
expecting
them
to
be
obeyed
instead
of
being
grateful
for
his
timely
assistance
she
was
irritated
that
he
should
have
happened
by
just
in
time
to
see
the
fulfilment
of
his
warning
his
superior
i
told
you
so
attitude
was
exasperating
to
a
degree
she
ended
by
uniting
her
various
wounded
sensibilities
into
a
single
feeling
of
resentment
toward
him
the
desire
that
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
was
a
wish
to
pay
him
back
to
make
him
feel
for
exactly
what
she
was
not
quite
clear
she
hung
up
in
the
wardrobe
the
simple
that
granton
had
laid
out
on
the
bed
and
chose
in
its
place
a
particularly
dignified
gown
with
a
particularly
long
train
having
piled
her
hair
on
the
top
of
her
head
she
added
a
diamond
star
and
a
necklace
with
a
diamond
pendant
she
did
not
often
wear
jewels
but
they
were
supposedly
american
and
irritating
to
a
man
of
sybert
s
cosmopolitan
sensibilities
quite
stately
she
murmured
critically
surveying
the
effect
in
the
mirror
one
might
almost
say
as
she
started
downstairs
she
was
waylaid
at
the
nursery
door
by
a
small
figure
in
a
white
nightgown
cousin
marcia
what
did
you
bwing
me
from
ve
festa
oh
gerald
i
brought
you
some
chocolate
and
i
left
it
in
the
carriage
but
never
mind
dear
it
s
too
late
anyway
for
you
to
eat
it
i
will
send
and
get
it
and
you
shall
have
it
with
your
breakfast
morning
be
a
good
boy
and
go
to
she
went
downstairs
with
her
mind
bent
upon
chocolate
and
crossed
the
empty
salon
to
the
little
at
the
rear
she
had
opened
the
door
and
burst
in
before
she
realized
that
any
one
was
inside
then
before
the
apology
had
risen
to
her
lips
she
had
heard
her
uncle
s
words
good
heavens
sybert
what
can
i
do
you
know
my
hands
are
tied
willard
copley
would
let
the
last
person
in
italy
starve
if
he
could
make
one
more
dollar
out
of
it
marcia
stood
still
looking
at
her
uncle
in
horror
while
the
meaning
of
his
words
sank
into
her
mind
he
whirled
around
upon
her
his
face
was
whiter
and
sterner
than
she
had
ever
seen
it
what
do
you
want
marcia
he
asked
sharply
why
don
t
you
knock
before
you
come
into
a
room
marcia
s
face
flushed
hotly
i
am
sorry
uncle
howard
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
didn
t
know
any
one
was
in
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
marcia
i
spoke
she
hesitated
in
the
doorway
and
then
faced
him
again
i
heard
what
you
said
will
you
please
tell
me
what
you
mean
copley
cast
an
annoyed
glance
at
sybert
who
was
standing
in
the
embrasure
by
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
floor
sybert
glanced
up
with
a
little
frown
and
then
with
a
shrug
turned
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
might
as
well
tell
you
i
appear
to
be
hearing
it
from
other
sources
your
father
has
been
the
originator
this
spring
of
a
very
successful
corner
in
wheat
he
is
as
you
know
a
keen
judge
of
markets
and
foreseeing
that
wheat
for
a
number
of
reasons
was
likely
to
be
scarce
he
and
one
or
two
of
his
friends
have
purchased
the
whole
of
the
visible
supply
as
italy
has
had
to
import
more
than
pay
for
it
in
gold
when
she
hasn
t
much
but
paper
at
her
can
readily
see
that
it
places
her
in
an
awkward
position
america
is
a
great
country
marcia
when
a
single
one
of
her
citizens
can
bankrupt
a
whole
you
don
t
mean
uncle
howard
she
cried
aghast
that
my
father
has
caused
the
wheat
famine
there
may
be
one
or
two
minor
causes
but
i
think
he
is
deserving
of
most
of
the
credit
the
name
of
copley
i
assure
you
is
not
beloved
in
italy
just
and
that
is
what
the
boys
meant
when
they
shouted
grano
oh
it
s
no
secret
we
re
celebrities
in
our
small
way
two
continents
are
ringing
with
the
name
of
the
american
wheat
king
and
we
come
in
for
a
share
of
his
fame
when
you
think
about
it
he
added
there
is
something
beautifully
fitting
about
our
taking
villa
vivalanti
this
spring
we
appear
to
be
american
editions
of
the
bad
i
fancy
the
old
gentleman
turned
in
his
grave
and
smiled
a
trifle
when
i
signed
the
but
uncle
howard
he
doesn
t
understand
he
does
it
like
a
mathematical
problem
just
to
show
what
he
can
do
just
for
the
pleasure
of
winning
why
don
t
you
write
to
him
why
didn
t
you
tell
him
tell
him
copley
laughed
you
have
not
been
acquainted
with
your
father
for
so
many
years
as
i
have
marcia
why
should
he
care
for
a
lot
of
italian
peasants
there
are
too
many
of
them
in
existence
already
the
food
in
this
world
has
to
be
fought
for
and
those
who
are
beaten
deserve
to
marcia
s
face
turned
white
as
the
meaning
of
a
hundred
petty
incidents
flashed
through
her
mind
that
before
had
had
no
significance
she
knew
now
why
the
people
in
rome
had
stopped
talking
about
the
wheat
famine
when
she
entered
the
room
she
understood
sybert
s
attitude
toward
her
all
the
quizzical
expression
once
or
twice
when
she
spent
money
she
recalled
the
newspaper
the
workman
in
rome
had
thrust
in
her
del
cry
of
the
people
she
did
not
have
to
ask
now
what
it
meant
the
very
beggars
in
the
street
had
known
of
her
shame
while
she
alone
was
ignorant
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
she
cried
i
did
not
wish
to
spoil
your
pleasure
there
is
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
be
happy
if
all
goes
well
a
year
from
now
you
will
be
one
of
the
notable
heiresses
of
america
i
only
hope
when
you
re
enjoying
your
wealth
that
you
ll
not
think
of
the
poor
starving
wretches
in
italy
who
gave
it
to
copley
s
tone
was
as
brutal
as
his
words
he
had
forgotten
the
girl
before
him
he
was
talking
to
the
man
in
america
marcia
turned
away
and
with
a
deep
sob
sank
down
by
the
table
and
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
sybert
threw
up
his
head
quickly
with
a
glance
of
anger
and
copley
suddenly
came
to
his
senses
he
sprang
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
for
heaven
s
sake
marcia
don
t
cry
about
it
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
saying
i
m
nervous
and
excited
and
worried
it
isn
t
as
bad
as
i
told
marcia
had
a
pitiable
sense
that
she
was
acting
like
a
child
when
of
all
times
she
ought
to
be
calm
and
think
but
the
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
had
swept
her
away
she
had
indeed
been
living
in
a
fools
paradise
the
past
few
months
the
poor
people
sybert
had
told
her
of
starving
thousands
in
own
father
was
the
cause
and
the
peasants
of
castel
wonder
they
hated
her
while
she
distributed
chocolate
with
such
graceful
condescension
her
father
was
taking
away
their
bread
she
thought
over
her
uncle
s
words
and
then
as
she
realized
their
content
she
suddenly
rose
and
faced
the
two
men
uncle
howard
she
said
i
think
you
ve
done
very
wrong
not
to
tell
me
this
before
i
had
a
right
to
know
and
i
could
have
helped
it
my
father
loves
his
business
but
he
loves
me
better
it
s
true
as
i
say
he
s
just
doing
it
as
a
sort
of
problem
he
doesn
t
see
the
suffering
he
causes
and
he
doesn
t
really
believe
there
is
any
of
course
he
knows
that
some
people
lose
when
he
gains
but
he
thinks
that
they
go
into
it
with
their
eyes
open
and
that
they
must
accept
the
chances
of
war
he
s
exactly
as
good
a
man
as
either
of
and
then
as
a
sudden
recollection
flashed
across
her
she
whirled
about
toward
sybert
her
glance
divided
between
indignation
and
contempt
and
you
called
me
the
wheat
princess
before
every
one
in
paul
dessart
s
studio
you
knew
that
it
wasn
t
my
fault
you
knew
that
i
didn
t
even
know
about
the
trouble
and
you
laughed
when
i
told
the
story
of
the
vivalanti
her
voice
broke
slightly
and
turning
her
back
she
drew
a
piece
of
paper
toward
her
on
the
table
and
began
to
write
there
she
said
holding
out
a
scrawled
sheet
toward
her
uncle
there
is
a
cablegram
please
see
that
it
is
sent
copley
ran
his
eyes
over
it
in
silence
and
his
mouth
twitched
involuntarily
into
a
smile
well
marcia
i
ll
see
that
it
goes
i
don
t
may
do
some
good
after
he
paused
awkwardly
a
moment
and
held
out
his
hand
am
i
forgiven
he
asked
i
shouldn
t
have
said
anything
against
your
father
but
he
s
my
brother
remember
and
while
i
abuse
him
myself
i
wouldn
t
let
an
outsider
do
it
you
are
right
he
doesn
t
know
what
he
is
doing
you
must
forget
what
i
said
i
have
thought
about
it
too
much
every
one
in
italy
believes
that
i
have
an
interest
in
the
deal
and
when
i
am
doing
my
best
to
help
things
along
it
is
a
little
hard
you
know
to
be
the
very
people
i
am
giving
being
the
cause
of
their
yes
uncle
howard
i
understand
i
don
t
blame
you
she
returned
with
a
note
of
weariness
in
her
voice
is
really
the
kindest
man
in
the
ah
marcia
a
very
man
nowadays
can
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
by
telegraph
without
having
to
witness
the
sybert
crossed
the
room
toward
her
with
a
curious
deep
look
in
his
eyes
he
half
held
out
his
hand
but
marcia
turned
away
without
appearing
to
notice
and
picking
up
her
uncle
s
from
the
table
she
tore
out
a
leaf
and
scrawled
across
the
face
there
s
some
money
for
the
relief
committee
she
said
as
she
tossed
the
slip
of
paper
across
the
table
toward
him
that
s
all
i
have
in
the
bank
just
at
present
but
i
will
give
some
more
as
soon
as
i
get
sybert
s
face
was
equally
impassive
as
he
glanced
from
the
paper
back
to
her
thirteen
thousand
lire
is
a
good
deal
do
you
think
you
i
do
as
i
please
with
my
own
my
own
she
added
in
parenthesis
my
mother
left
it
to
as
you
please
he
returned
pocketing
the
slip
with
a
i
know
a
village
in
calabria
that
will
be
very
grateful
for
a
little
help
until
the
olives
ripen
dinner
is
served
announced
pietro
in
the
doorway
marcia
nodded
to
the
two
men
i
don
t
want
any
dinner
and
she
turned
upstairs
to
her
room
she
sat
for
half
an
hour
staring
out
at
the
darkening
campagna
then
she
rose
and
lighted
the
candles
and
commenced
a
letter
to
her
father
her
pen
she
dipped
in
blood
she
told
him
everything
she
had
heard
or
seen
or
imagined
about
the
hunger
madness
in
the
north
and
the
starving
peasants
in
the
south
of
the
poor
people
of
castel
vivalanti
and
little
gervasio
she
told
him
what
the
people
said
about
her
uncle
that
they
called
her
the
wheat
princess
and
that
the
children
in
the
streets
taunted
her
as
she
went
past
she
told
him
that
the
name
of
copley
was
despised
from
end
to
end
of
italy
all
the
crimes
that
have
ever
been
laid
at
the
door
of
the
government
and
the
church
and
the
ignorance
of
the
people
marcia
heaped
upon
her
offending
father
s
shoulders
but
with
the
forgiving
assurance
that
she
knew
he
didn
t
mean
it
and
would
he
please
prove
that
he
didn
t
mean
it
by
stopping
the
corner
immediately
and
sending
wheat
to
italy
it
was
a
letter
to
wring
a
father
s
a
financier
s
chapter
xvii
for
the
next
week
or
so
marcia
steadfastly
avoided
meeting
people
there
were
no
visitors
at
the
villa
and
it
was
easy
to
find
pretexts
for
not
going
into
rome
she
felt
an
overwhelming
reluctance
to
meeting
any
of
her
meeting
any
one
in
truth
who
even
knew
her
name
it
seemed
to
her
that
beneath
their
smiles
and
pleasant
speeches
she
could
read
their
thoughts
that
the
words
wheat
wheat
wheat
rang
as
an
undertone
to
every
sentence
that
was
spoken
her
horseback
rides
were
ridden
in
the
direction
away
from
castel
vivalanti
and
if
by
chance
she
did
meet
any
of
her
former
friends
the
villagers
she
galloped
past
looking
the
other
way
copley
was
engaged
with
preparations
for
the
coming
ball
it
was
to
be
partially
in
honour
of
the
roystons
partially
in
honour
of
marcia
s
birthday
and
all
of
as
much
of
it
as
existed
for
the
to
be
asked
to
stop
the
night
either
at
villa
vivalanti
or
at
the
contessa
s
villa
in
tivoli
marcia
her
aunt
complained
showed
an
inordinate
lack
of
interest
in
these
absorbing
preparations
she
was
usually
ready
enough
with
suggestions
and
her
listlessness
did
not
pass
unnoticed
copley
s
eyes
occasionally
rested
upon
her
with
a
guiltily
worried
expression
and
if
she
caught
the
look
she
immediately
assumed
an
air
of
gaiety
neither
had
made
the
slightest
reference
to
the
subject
of
that
evening
s
scene
except
upon
the
arrival
of
a
characteristic
cablegram
from
willard
copley
in
which
he
informed
his
daughter
that
he
was
sending
her
a
transport
of
wheat
as
a
birthday
present
you
see
uncle
howard
she
had
said
as
she
handed
him
the
message
it
is
possible
to
do
good
as
well
as
harm
by
copley
read
it
with
a
slight
smile
after
all
i
m
afraid
he
s
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
us
and
with
that
wheat
was
a
tabooed
subject
for
the
future
however
he
was
particularly
thoughtful
toward
his
niece
to
show
that
he
was
sorry
and
she
met
his
advances
more
than
to
show
that
she
had
forgiven
and
all
in
all
they
came
to
a
better
understanding
because
of
their
momentary
falling
out
copley
accounted
for
marcia
s
apathy
and
possibly
nearest
the
truth
on
the
ground
that
she
had
taken
a
touch
of
malaria
in
the
old
and
she
dosed
her
with
quinine
until
the
poor
girl
s
head
rang
it
happened
therefore
that
when
the
evening
came
to
attend
a
musicale
at
the
contessa
torrenieri
s
villa
marcia
could
very
gracefully
decline
the
occasion
of
the
function
was
the
count
s
return
from
the
riviera
and
although
marcia
had
some
little
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
count
still
it
did
not
mount
to
such
proportions
that
she
was
ready
to
face
the
rest
of
the
world
for
its
sake
tivoli
and
villa
torrenieri
were
a
long
nine
miles
away
and
villa
vivalanti
that
evening
dined
earlier
than
usual
as
marcia
came
downstairs
in
response
to
pietro
s
summons
she
paused
a
moment
on
the
landing
she
had
caught
the
sound
of
sybert
s
low
voice
in
the
salon
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
tempestuous
ending
of
the
san
marco
festa
and
she
had
not
yet
determined
on
just
what
footing
their
relations
were
she
stood
hesitating
with
a
very
slight
quickening
of
the
pulse
and
then
with
a
decided
thrill
of
annoyance
as
an
explanation
for
his
unexpected
visit
presented
had
returned
from
naples
and
come
out
to
villa
vivalanti
for
the
purpose
of
attending
the
contessa
s
musicale
marcia
went
on
downstairs
more
slowly
and
entered
the
salon
with
a
none
too
cordial
air
sybert
s
own
greeting
was
in
his
usual
vein
of
polite
indifference
his
manner
contained
not
the
slightest
suggestion
of
any
misunderstanding
in
the
past
it
transpired
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
impending
party
he
was
clothed
in
an
unpretentious
but
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
attend
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
was
doubtless
waiting
for
him
in
naples
he
his
host
would
lend
him
a
coat
his
host
grumblingly
assented
and
sybert
inquired
with
a
glance
from
copley
s
velvet
and
jewels
to
marcia
s
simple
white
woollen
gown
what
time
they
were
planning
to
start
about
eight
it
takes
almost
two
hours
to
get
there
said
copley
marcia
is
not
going
she
added
why
not
miss
marcia
she
looked
a
trifle
as
she
put
forth
her
excuse
i
ve
been
having
a
little
touch
of
malaria
and
aunt
katherine
thought
perhaps
the
night
i
remember
when
i
was
a
boy
in
school
i
used
frequently
to
have
headaches
on
monday
mornings
said
sybert
with
a
show
of
sympathy
marcia
sat
in
her
room
till
she
heard
the
carriage
drive
away
then
she
dragged
a
wicker
chair
out
to
the
balcony
which
overlooked
the
eastern
hills
already
darkened
into
silhouettes
against
the
sky
she
sat
leaning
back
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
watching
the
outlines
of
the
old
monastery
fade
into
the
night
she
thought
of
the
pale
young
monk
with
his
questioning
eyes
and
wondered
what
sort
of
troubles
people
who
lived
in
monasteries
had
they
were
at
least
not
her
troubles
she
smiled
as
she
thought
of
paul
dessart
suddenly
she
leaned
over
the
railing
and
sniffed
the
light
breeze
as
it
floated
up
from
the
garden
mingled
with
the
sweet
scent
of
lilies
and
oleanders
was
the
heavy
odour
of
a
cigar
her
pulses
suddenly
quickened
she
pushed
her
chair
back
and
rose
with
an
impatient
movement
pietro
was
holding
a
rendezvous
with
his
friends
again
and
entertaining
them
with
her
uncle
s
tobacco
the
night
was
chilly
and
she
was
cold
she
turned
into
the
dark
room
with
a
little
laugh
at
herself
she
was
staying
away
from
the
contessa
s
musicale
to
avoid
the
night
air
she
groped
about
the
table
for
a
book
and
started
downstairs
with
the
intention
of
reading
out
the
evening
in
the
salon
a
wood
fire
had
been
kindled
that
afternoon
to
dispel
the
slight
dampness
which
the
stone
walls
seemed
to
exude
at
the
slightest
suggestion
of
an
eastern
wind
it
had
burned
low
now
and
the
embers
gave
out
a
slight
glow
which
was
not
obliterated
by
the
two
flickering
candles
on
the
s
frugal
soul
evidently
looked
upon
the
lamp
as
unnecessary
when
and
copley
were
away
marcia
piled
on
more
sticks
with
a
shake
of
her
head
at
italian
servants
the
one
thing
in
the
world
that
they
can
not
learn
is
to
build
a
fire
generations
of
economy
having
ingrained
within
them
a
notion
that
fuel
is
too
precious
to
burn
the
blaze
once
more
started
instead
of
ringing
for
a
lamp
and
settling
down
to
her
book
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
lazily
watching
the
flames
italy
had
got
its
hold
upon
her
with
its
spell
of
lethian
inertia
she
wished
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
drift
idly
with
the
current
presently
she
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
close
and
steps
cross
the
hall
she
looked
up
with
a
start
to
see
laurence
sybert
in
the
doorway
what
s
the
i
surprise
you
he
inquired
yes
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
the
i
was
in
the
just
as
much
as
you
he
returned
with
a
little
laugh
as
he
drew
up
a
chair
beside
her
why
can
t
i
have
malaria
too
his
sudden
appearance
had
been
disconcerting
and
her
usual
seemed
to
be
wandering
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
she
half
rose
i
was
just
going
to
ring
for
the
lamp
when
you
came
pietro
must
have
forgotten
it
would
you
sybert
glanced
lazily
across
the
room
at
the
bell
oh
sit
still
we
have
light
enough
to
talk
by
and
you
surely
aren
t
intending
to
read
when
you
have
a
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
possession
of
her
book
i
don
t
flatter
myself
that
you
stayed
away
from
the
contessa
s
to
talk
to
me
she
returned
as
she
leaned
back
again
with
a
slight
shrug
why
else
should
i
have
stayed
he
inquired
do
you
think
when
it
came
to
the
point
your
uncle
wouldn
t
give
me
a
coat
probably
you
found
that
it
didn
t
sybert
laughed
no
miss
marcia
i
didn
t
even
try
i
stayed
wanted
to
talk
with
she
let
the
statement
pass
in
silence
and
sybert
addressed
himself
to
a
careful
rearrangement
of
the
burning
wood
when
he
finally
laid
down
the
tongs
he
remarked
in
a
casual
tone
i
owe
you
an
you
accept
it
what
for
you
appear
to
have
several
counts
against
we
don
t
go
into
details
i
offer
a
collective
because
you
called
me
the
wheat
princess
oh
yes
i
ll
excuse
it
i
dare
say
you
were
he
leaned
forward
with
a
slight
frown
certainly
i
was
not
justified
it
was
neither
kind
nor
gentlemanly
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
said
it
i
can
only
promise
to
have
better
manners
in
the
marcia
dismissed
the
subject
with
a
gesture
let
me
tell
you
about
the
good
your
money
has
no
please
don
t
i
don
t
want
to
hear
i
know
that
it
s
horrible
and
that
you
did
the
best
with
it
possible
i
m
glad
if
it
helped
my
father
is
sending
some
wheat
that
will
be
here
in
a
few
miss
marcia
he
said
slowly
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
take
this
matter
so
badly
your
uncle
was
out
of
his
senses
when
he
talked
to
you
and
he
didn
t
realize
what
he
was
saying
he
feels
awfully
cut
up
about
it
he
told
me
that
he
was
afraid
he
had
spoiled
your
summer
and
that
he
wouldn
t
have
hurt
you
for
the
marcia
s
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
tears
and
she
bit
her
lip
sybert
leaned
forward
and
poked
the
fire
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
your
uncle
he
said
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
embers
he
is
one
of
the
finest
men
i
have
ever
known
and
it
is
not
often
that
a
man
in
his
position
amounts
to
is
as
a
human
being
the
temptations
are
all
the
other
way
most
men
you
know
with
leisure
and
his
tastes
go
in
for
collecting
carved
ivory
and
hammered
silver
and
all
that
rubbish
nobody
understands
what
he
is
trying
to
do
least
of
all
the
people
he
is
doing
it
for
he
does
it
very
quietly
and
in
his
own
way
and
he
doesn
t
ask
for
thanks
still
just
a
little
appreciation
would
be
grateful
and
instead
of
that
he
is
abused
at
every
turn
this
wheat
business
increased
the
feeling
against
him
and
naturally
he
feels
sore
the
other
evening
he
d
just
been
reading
some
articles
about
the
trouble
in
a
roman
paper
and
i
had
been
telling
him
about
your
encounter
with
the
village
people
when
you
came
in
it
was
an
unfortunate
moment
you
chose
and
he
forgot
himself
i
wish
you
would
be
as
kind
to
him
as
you
can
for
he
has
a
good
many
critics
outside
sybert
hesitated
an
he
needs
a
little
sympathy
at
marcia
drew
a
deep
breath
i
understand
about
uncle
howard
she
said
i
used
to
think
she
hesitated
that
he
wasn
t
very
happy
but
i
didn
t
know
the
reason
of
course
i
don
t
blame
him
for
what
he
said
i
know
he
was
worried
and
i
know
he
didn
t
mean
it
in
any
case
i
should
rather
know
the
truth
but
about
the
wheat
she
continued
my
father
is
not
to
blame
the
way
you
think
he
is
he
and
uncle
howard
don
t
understand
each
other
but
i
understand
them
both
and
if
i
had
known
sooner
i
could
have
stopped
it
he
didn
t
have
the
remotest
idea
of
harming
italy
or
any
other
country
he
just
thought
about
getting
ahead
of
a
lot
of
others
know
what
men
are
people
look
up
to
him
he
s
very
quick
he
sees
things
faster
than
other
men
he
knows
what
s
going
to
happen
ahead
of
time
and
you
can
t
expect
him
not
to
take
advantage
of
it
of
course
he
wants
to
make
money
too
but
it
isn
t
all
that
for
he
doesn
t
use
it
after
he
gets
it
made
it
s
the
beating
others
that
he
power
it
gives
him
i
m
afraid
she
added
with
a
slightly
pathetic
smile
that
i
shall
have
to
go
home
and
look
after
oh
certainly
miss
marcia
we
all
know
that
your
father
had
no
thought
of
deliberately
harming
italy
or
any
other
country
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
american
wheat
corner
has
not
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
trouble
as
the
italian
government
would
have
us
believe
the
simple
truth
is
that
your
father
has
been
used
as
a
scapegoat
while
the
roman
papers
have
been
suggestively
silent
on
many
points
they
have
had
much
to
say
of
the
american
wheat
have
the
things
they
said
been
very
bad
sybert
smiled
a
trifle
there
s
not
been
much
to
tell
the
truth
that
he
will
care
to
cut
out
and
paste
in
his
our
party
next
week
seems
heartless
doesn
t
of
like
giving
a
ball
while
the
people
next
door
are
having
a
funeral
i
wanted
to
give
it
up
but
uncle
howard
looked
so
hurt
when
i
proposed
it
that
i
didn
t
say
anything
more
about
no
certainly
not
that
would
be
foolish
and
useless
because
some
people
have
to
be
unhappy
is
no
reason
why
all
should
i
suppose
not
she
agreed
slowly
and
then
she
added
the
world
used
to
be
so
much
pleasanter
to
live
in
before
i
knew
there
was
any
misery
in
wish
i
didn
t
have
to
know
miss
marcia
i
told
you
the
other
day
that
it
was
a
relief
sometimes
to
see
people
who
are
thoroughly
irresponsibly
happy
who
dance
over
the
pit
without
knowing
it
s
there
a
man
who
has
been
in
the
pit
who
knows
all
its
feels
as
if
he
reeked
with
occasionally
to
see
some
one
who
doesn
t
even
know
of
its
existence
and
yet
in
the
end
do
you
think
he
can
thoroughly
respect
such
blindness
don
t
you
feel
that
you
are
happier
in
a
worthier
sense
when
you
look
at
life
with
your
eyes
open
when
you
honestly
take
the
bad
along
with
the
good
she
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
apparently
considering
his
words
presently
he
as
for
your
party
i
think
you
may
dance
with
a
free
conscience
you
ve
done
what
you
could
to
help
matters
on
and
you
ll
do
a
great
deal
more
in
the
i
m
afraid
that
my
conscience
didn
t
have
much
to
do
with
wanting
to
give
up
the
ball
she
acknowledged
with
a
slightly
guilty
laugh
it
s
simply
that
i
can
t
bear
to
meet
people
and
feel
that
all
the
time
they
re
talking
to
me
they
re
calling
me
in
their
minds
the
wheat
that
i
suppose
you
know
is
very
silly
it
s
the
price
you
have
to
pay
and
i
haven
t
much
sympathy
to
offer
however
you
need
not
let
it
bother
you
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
will
not
be
many
men
here
who
would
not
be
wheat
kings
themselves
if
they
had
the
knowing
beforehand
all
the
suffering
it
was
going
to
bring
to
this
country
and
now
suppose
we
don
t
talk
about
wheat
any
more
you
ve
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
too
you
re
not
very
optimistic
she
said
oh
well
i
m
not
blind
it
takes
an
italian
to
be
optimistic
in
this
do
you
like
the
italians
or
don
t
you
she
asked
sometimes
you
seem
to
and
sometimes
you
act
as
if
you
despised
yes
certainly
i
like
them
i
was
born
in
but
you
re
an
american
she
said
quickly
he
laughed
at
her
tone
you
surely
want
to
be
an
american
she
insisted
as
henry
james
says
miss
marcia
one
s
country
like
one
s
grandmother
is
antecedent
to
she
studied
the
fire
for
some
time
without
speaking
and
sybert
leaning
back
lazily
studied
her
her
next
observation
surprised
him
you
said
the
other
day
sybert
that
every
man
lived
for
some
idea
and
i
ve
been
wondering
what
yours
a
curious
expression
flashed
over
his
face
you
couldn
t
expect
me
to
tell
i
m
a
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
not
very
much
connected
with
in
which
case
it
would
be
poor
diplomacy
for
me
to
give
it
mr
sybert
you
give
a
person
a
queer
impression
as
if
you
were
acting
a
part
all
the
time
and
didn
t
want
people
to
know
what
you
were
really
an
anarchist
must
be
careful
the
i
believe
you
are
one
she
cried
don
t
be
alarmed
i
assure
you
i
am
not
but
he
added
with
a
little
flash
of
fire
i
swear
in
a
country
like
this
one
would
like
to
for
action
oh
i
m
not
a
fool
he
added
in
response
to
her
smile
we
re
living
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
not
in
the
thirteenth
anarchy
belongs
to
the
dark
ages
as
much
as
you
re
so
difficult
to
place
i
like
to
know
whether
people
are
democrats
or
republicans
and
whether
they
are
presbyterians
or
episcopalians
then
one
always
knows
where
to
find
them
and
is
not
in
danger
of
hurting
their
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
claim
any
such
respectable
connexions
as
those
sybert
laughed
half
the
time
one
would
think
you
were
a
catholic
by
the
way
you
stand
up
for
the
priests
the
other
half
one
would
think
you
weren
t
anything
by
the
way
you
abuse
this
mania
for
classifying
what
difference
if
a
person
calls
himself
a
catholic
or
a
baptist
a
unitarian
or
a
buddhist
it
s
all
one
a
man
is
not
necessarily
irreligious
because
he
doesn
t
subscribe
to
any
mr
sybert
she
dared
i
used
to
be
terribly
suspicious
of
you
i
knew
you
weren
t
just
the
way
you
appeared
and
i
thought
you
were
really
rather
bad
but
i
m
beginning
to
believe
you
re
unusually
oh
i
say
miss
marcia
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at
do
you
want
me
to
confess
to
a
hair
shirt
underneath
my
am
afraid
you
must
leave
that
to
our
friend
the
monk
up
on
his
no
i
didn
t
mean
just
that
flagellations
and
hair
shirts
strike
me
as
a
pretty
useless
sort
of
it
does
seem
a
poor
business
he
agreed
for
a
strong
young
fellow
like
that
to
give
up
his
whole
life
to
the
work
of
getting
his
soul
into
still
if
he
wants
paradise
that
much
and
is
willing
to
make
the
it
s
setting
a
pretty
high
value
on
his
own
soul
i
should
never
rate
mine
as
being
worth
a
lifetime
of
i
suppose
a
person
s
soul
is
worth
whatever
price
he
chooses
to
oh
of
course
if
a
man
keeps
his
soul
in
a
bandbox
he
can
produce
it
immaculate
in
the
end
but
what
s
a
soul
for
if
it
s
not
for
use
he
would
much
better
live
in
the
world
with
his
and
help
them
keep
their
souls
clean
even
at
the
risk
of
getting
his
own
a
little
yes
perhaps
that
s
true
she
conceded
such
dust
will
doubtless
brush
off
in
the
it
certainly
ought
if
things
are
managed
i
can
t
help
feeling
sorry
though
for
the
poor
young
monk
he
will
be
so
disappointed
when
he
brings
out
his
shiny
new
soul
to
find
that
it
doesn
t
rank
any
higher
than
some
of
the
dusty
ones
that
have
been
dragged
through
the
it
will
serve
him
right
sybert
declared
he
ought
to
have
been
thinking
of
other
people
s
souls
instead
of
his
tis
a
dangerous
thing
to
play
with
souls
and
matter
enough
to
save
one
s
own
quoted
marcia
oh
well
he
shrugged
i
won
t
argue
with
the
poet
and
the
priests
both
against
me
but
you
think
that
your
speckled
soul
is
exactly
as
good
at
other
people
s
white
souls
it
all
depends
he
demurred
upon
how
they
kept
theirs
white
and
how
i
got
mine
our
frate
has
afforded
a
long
moral
she
laughed
i
suspect
he
didn
t
deserve
it
he
looks
poor
devil
as
if
his
heart
were
still
in
the
world
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
is
in
the
in
that
case
she
returned
he
s
lost
the
world
for
nothing
for
his
prayers
will
not
be
answered
unless
his
heart
is
in
there
s
a
tragedy
said
to
have
lost
the
world
and
then
in
spite
of
it
to
turn
up
in
the
end
with
a
dusty
soul
they
looked
at
each
other
soberly
and
then
they
both
laughed
philosophy
is
a
queer
thing
said
marcia
you
may
go
as
far
as
you
please
but
you
always
end
where
you
bubbles
that
glitter
as
they
rise
and
break
on
vain
philosophy
s
spring
he
repeated
softly
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
and
then
he
leaned
toward
her
and
laughed
again
miss
marcia
do
you
know
i
have
an
idea
what
is
it
she
asked
it
s
about
you
and
have
a
theory
that
we
might
be
pretty
good
i
thought
we
d
been
friends
for
some
time
she
returned
evasively
i
am
sure
my
uncle
s
friends
are
really
i
hadn
t
suspected
it
but
it
s
the
same
with
friends
as
with
politics
and
religion
they
don
t
amount
to
much
until
you
find
them
for
she
considered
this
in
silence
i
should
say
he
added
that
we
d
been
pretty
good
enemies
all
this
time
what
do
you
say
to
our
being
friends
for
a
change
marcia
glanced
away
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
shyness
shall
we
try
it
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
bending
toward
her
and
laying
his
hand
palm
upward
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
she
dropped
her
hand
into
his
hesitatingly
and
his
fingers
closed
upon
it
he
looked
at
the
fire
a
moment
and
then
back
in
her
face
marcia
he
said
softly
did
you
ever
hear
the
tuscan
proverb
the
foes
of
yesterday
become
the
friends
of
and
the
lovers
of
a
quick
wave
of
colour
swept
over
her
face
and
a
faint
answering
flush
appeared
in
his
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
light
laugh
that
put
the
last
few
minutes
ages
away
i
m
afraid
it
s
getting
late
and
aunt
katherine
would
be
scandalized
if
she
found
her
malaria
patient
waiting
up
for
her
i
will
leave
you
to
smoke
in

rose
and
followed
her
into
the
hall
he
chose
a
tall
brass
candlestick
from
the
row
on
the
lighted
it
and
handed
it
to
her
with
a
silent
bow
thank
you
said
marcia
with
a
brief
glance
at
his
face
she
paused
on
the
landing
and
looked
down
he
was
standing
on
the
rug
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
watching
her
with
an
amused
smile
signor
siberti
she
murmured
signorina
he
returned
with
a
little
laugh

anything
more
about

than

s
silence
breathed
acquiescence
in
this
statement
and
under
impulse
of
the
implied
compliment
she
became
more
sprightly
in
her
movements
as
she
skilfully
twisted
marcia
s
hair
into
a
seemingly
simple
coil
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
for
the
past
three
days
the
house
had
been
full
of
guests
and
though
marcia
had
been
somewhat
cold
in
her
anticipations
of
the
time
she
found
herself
thoroughly
enjoying
it
when
it
came
the
days
had
been
filled
with
rides
and
drives
and
impromptu
gaiety
paul
dessart
had
been
master
of
the
revels
and
he
filled
the
office
brilliantly
he
had
supplied
the
leaven
of
fun
on
every
occasion
and
had
been
so
thoroughly
tactful
that
his
host
and
hostess
had
gratefully
blessed
him
and
marcia
had
cast
him
more
than
one
involuntary
glance
of
approval
and
this
was
her
birthday
and
the
night
of
the
ball
all
day
long
she
had
been
the
centre
of
a
congratulatory
group
the
recipient
of
prettily
worded
felicitations
and
she
not
unnaturally
found
it
pleasant
the
afternoon
train
had
brought
still
more
guests
from
rome
and
villa
vivalanti
s
nineteen
bedrooms
were
none
too
many
five
o
clock
tea
on
the
terrace
had
in
itself
been
in
the
nature
of
a
festa
with
gaily
dressed
groups
coming
and
going
amid
the
sound
of
laughter
and
low
voices
while
the
excitable
italian
servants
scurried
to
and
fro
placing
and
carrying
cups
marcia
had
been
secretly
disappointed
that
afternoon
by
the
of
one
guest
whom
she
had
half
eleanor
royston
had
been
frankly
so
mr
copley
eleanor
had
inquired
of
her
host
as
he
offered
her
a
cup
of
tea
where
s
that
friend
of
yours
laurence
sybert
quelling
rioters
i
presume
it
s
more
in
his
line
just
now
than
attending
as
if
anything
could
be
more
in
a
diplomat
s
line
than
attending
balls
with
all
the
other
diplomats
here
and
off
their
guard
it
s
just
the
time
to
learn
state
secrets
and
he
s
the
most
interesting
man
in
rome
she
complained
i
wanted
to
add
him
to
my
your
collection
copley
s
startled
expression
approached
a
stare
of
interesting
men
she
explained
oh
don
t
be
alarmed
i
don
t
scalp
them
the
collection
is
purely
s
small
enough
so
far
to
be
carried
in
my
head
it
s
merely
that
i
am
a
student
of
human
nature
and
am
constantly
on
the
alert
for
fresh
specimens
your
sybert
is
puzzling
i
don
t
know
just
how
to
classify
ah
i
see
it
is
merely
a
scientific
interest
you
take
in
copley
s
tone
was
one
of
relief
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
with
the
am
sure
that
he
would
feel
honoured
to
grace
your
i
am
not
so
sure
said
marcia
wait
till
you
hear
the
others
uncle
howard
a
kansas
politician
who
wants
to
be
a
poet
an
engineer
on
the
claytons
yacht
a
russian
prince
who
talks
seven
languages
and
can
t
express
his
thoughts
in
any
were
the
others
eleanor
oh
yes
the
blacksmith
who
married
the
maid
and
beats
you
don
t
do
them
justice
eleanor
remonstrated
those
are
merely
their
accidental
extrinsic
qualities
that
which
makes
them
interesting
is
something
copley
shot
her
an
amused
glance
and
drawing
up
a
chair
sat
down
beside
her
prepared
to
argue
it
out
the
list
has
possibilities
miss
royston
he
assured
her
though
of
course
one
can
t
judge
without
knowing
the
gentlemen
personally
with
which
one
may
i
ask
are
you
going
to
classify
sybert
oh
in
a
separate
pigeonhole
by
himself
that
is
just
what
makes
my
collection
it
was
evidently
a
subject
that
she
discussed
with
some
relish
most
men
you
look
them
over
and
immediately
assign
them
to
a
group
with
a
lot
of
others
but
once
in
a
while
you
come
across
a
man
who
goes
entirely
by
what
the
french
call
an
he
is
worth
copley
took
out
a
cigarette
and
regarded
it
speculatively
i
see
he
said
the
best
study
of
mankind
is
so
you
think
sybert
a
specimen
who
deserves
a
pigeonhole
by
himself
yes
i
think
he
does
though
i
haven
t
quite
decided
on
the
hole
yet
that
s
why
it
worries
me
that
he
didn
t
come
to
the
party
one
hates
to
leave
these
little
matters
i
am
sincerely
sorry
for
you
to
have
lost
the
opportunity
i
must
tell
him
your
no
indeed
remonstrated
eleanor
i
may
meet
him
again
some
day
and
if
you
tell
him
i
shall
never
learn
the
truth
one
s
only
chance
is
to
catch
them
you
re
a
very
penetrating
person
miss
i
ve
been
out
nine
seasons
she
laughed
you
can
trust
me
to
know
a
man
when
i
see
one
i
wish
you
d
teach
marcia
some
of
your
lore
he
murmured
as
he
turned
toward
the
loggia
to
greet
a
fresh
carriageful
of
guests
even
though
one
man
were
missing
still
a
great
many
others
were
there
and
it
had
only
been
an
undercurrent
of
marcia
s
consciousness
in
any
case
that
had
considered
the
matter
the
laughter
and
babel
of
voices
the
gay
preparations
and
hurrying
servants
had
had
their
effect
as
granton
clasped
about
her
neck
copley
s
expiatory
copy
of
an
old
etruscan
necklace
in
pearls
and
uncut
emeralds
set
in
hammered
was
as
pleasurably
excited
as
a
young
woman
may
legitimately
be
on
the
eve
of
a
birthday
ball
there
granton
that
s
all
she
cried
catching
up
her
very
parisian
skirts
and
flying
for
the
door
hurry
with
the
others
please
for
it
won
t
be
long
before
the
guests
begin
she
started
downstairs
pulling
on
her
gloves
as
she
went
she
paused
a
moment
on
the
landing
to
view
the
scene
below
and
she
blinked
once
or
twice
as
it
dawned
upon
her
that
laurence
sybert
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
watching
her
just
as
he
had
stood
the
last
time
she
had
seen
him
when
he
bade
her
for
a
moment
she
felt
an
absurd
tremor
run
through
her
and
then
with
something
like
a
gulp
she
collected
herself
and
went
on
down
to
greet
him
mr
sybert
we
were
afraid
you
weren
t
coming
when
did
you
get
here
on
the
late
train
i
have
been
in
the
south
and
i
didn
t
get
back
to
the
city
till
this
your
arrivals
are
always
so
spectacular
she
said
we
entirely
give
you
up
and
then
the
first
thing
we
know
you
are
quietly
standing
before
us
on
the
i
should
call
that
the
reverse
of
have
you
seen
uncle
howard
did
they
find
any
place
to
put
you
the
house
is
oh
yes
i
ve
been
officially
welcomed
i
have
a
bed
in
your
uncle
s
you
may
be
thankful
for
that
the
next
comer
i
am
afraid
will
be
put
in
the
sybert
did
not
choose
to
prolong
these
amenities
of
welcome
any
further
and
he
stood
quietly
watching
her
while
she
buttoned
her
gloves
she
looked
very
radiant
with
the
gleaming
on
her
hair
and
her
hazel
eyes
shining
with
excitement
her
gown
was
the
filmiest
shimmering
white
with
an
undertone
of
green
about
her
neck
the
pearls
gleamed
whitely
each
separate
jewel
a
pulsing
globe
of
light
marcia
glanced
up
and
touched
the
necklace
with
her
hand
this
is
uncle
howard
s
birthday
present
she
said
isn
t
it
lovely
it
s
a
copy
of
an
old
old
necklace
in
castellani
s
collection
my
uncle
gives
me
pearls
and
my
father
is
sending
she
turned
aside
into
the
long
salon
and
sybert
followed
her
if
marcia
had
been
momentarily
jostled
from
her
by
his
sudden
appearance
she
had
completely
regained
her
poise
she
was
buoyantly
at
her
ease
again
there
was
a
touch
of
intimacy
almost
of
coquetry
about
her
manner
as
she
talked
and
noted
the
fact
with
a
of
avoided
crossing
eyes
with
him
that
moment
by
the
fireside
was
still
too
vivid
they
returned
to
the
hall
and
marcia
stepped
to
the
door
leading
on
to
the
loggia
the
cornice
was
outlined
with
tiny
coloured
lamps
while
a
man
was
lighting
others
by
the
terrace
balustrade
she
glanced
back
at
sybert
who
was
standing
still
in
the
hall
you
aren
t
going
out
he
asked
just
a
moment
i
want
to
see
how
it
he
looked
at
her
bare
shoulders
with
a
slight
frown
bring
the
signorina
a
wrap
he
said
to
the
servant
at
the
door
i
don
t
need
a
wrap
said
marcia
it
s
a
warm
sybert
shook
his
head
with
an
expression
that
was
familiar
oh
if
you
wish
to
say
anything
say
it
she
cried
only
please
don
t
look
at
me
with
that
smile
it
s
the
way
you
looked
the
first
time
i
saw
i
don
t
like
i
have
nothing
to
say
when
a
young
woman
threatened
with
malaria
proposes
to
go
out
into
an
italian
night
a
mere
man
is
left
pride
would
keep
me
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
but
in
case
it
should
for
the
moment
he
took
the
long
white
cloak
from
the
man
s
arm
and
glanced
at
it
with
another
expression
as
he
placed
it
on
her
shoulders
it
was
composed
mostly
of
chiffon
and
lace
all
is
vanity
that
comes
from
a
paris
shop
laughed
marcia
sybert
lit
a
cigarette
and
followed
her
well
he
asked
as
they
paused
by
the
terrace
balustrade
does
it
meet
with
your
approval
it
s
lovely
isn
t
it
she
replied
as
she
looked
back
at
the
broad
white
façade
with
its
gleaming
windows
there
was
no
moon
but
a
clear
sky
in
all
the
dark
landscape
the
villa
alone
was
a
throbbing
centre
of
life
and
light
rows
of
coloured
lanterns
were
beginning
to
outline
the
avenue
leading
to
the
gate
and
in
the
ilex
grove
tiny
red
and
blue
and
white
bulbs
glowed
among
the
branches
like
the
blossoms
of
some
tropical
cereus
servants
were
hurrying
past
the
windows
musicians
were
commencing
to
tune
their
instruments
everywhere
was
the
excitement
of
preparation
and
this
is
your
birthday
he
said
i
suppose
you
have
received
many
pretty
speeches
miss
marcia
i
hope
they
may
all
come
she
glanced
up
in
his
face
and
he
looked
down
with
a
smile
is
a
great
age
a
shadow
flitted
across
her
face
isn
t
it
she
sighed
i
thought
was
bad
it
won
t
be
many
years
before
i
ll
be
really
getting
sybert
laughed
it
s
been
a
long
time
since
i
saw
i
first
came
back
to
twelve
years
said
marcia
it
s
an
easy
enough
problem
if
you
care
to
work
it
out
i
don
t
care
to
any
it
s
not
bad
for
a
man
she
said
but
a
woman
grows
old
so
young
you
need
not
worry
over
that
just
now
the
grey
hairs
will
not
come
for
some
time
i
m
not
worrying
she
laughed
i
was
just
isn
t
nice
to
grow
old
is
it
certainly
not
it
s
the
great
tragedy
of
life
and
it
comes
to
all
miss
you
as
well
as
to
the
poorest
peasant
girl
in
castel
vivalanti
life
after
all
contains
some
marcia
turned
her
back
to
the
shining
villa
and
looked
down
over
the
great
campagna
stretching
away
darkly
under
the
stars
with
here
and
there
the
gleam
of
a
shepherd
s
fire
built
to
ward
off
the
poison
in
the
air
things
are
not
very
just
she
said
slowly
not
very
he
agreed
and
one
has
little
faith
that
they
ever
will
in
this
world
or
the
it
would
be
comfortable
wouldn
t
it
if
you
could
only
believe
that
people
are
unfortunate
as
a
they
deserve
to
it
would
be
a
beautiful
belief
but
one
which
you
can
scarcely
hold
in
poor
italy
she
sighed
italy
he
echoed
with
a
sudden
motion
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
over
the
balustrade
and
immediately
lit
another
marcia
watched
his
face
in
the
flare
of
the
match
the
eyes
seemed
than
usual
the
jaw
more
boldly
marked
and
there
were
nervous
lines
about
the
mouth
his
face
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
in
the
last
few
weeks
they
turned
away
and
sauntered
toward
the
ilex
grove
there
are
however
compensations
he
went
on
presently
our
poor
peasants
do
not
have
all
the
pleasures
but
they
do
not
have
all
the
pains
either
there
are
a
great
many
girls
in
castel
vivalanti
who
will
never
have
a
birthday
ball
glanced
from
the
lighted
villa
behind
them
to
the
glowing
vista
in
front
the
green
stretch
of
the
ilex
walk
with
the
shimmering
fountain
at
the
whose
lives
will
be
very
bare
indeed
they
will
work
and
eat
and
sleep
and
love
and
perhaps
hate
and
that
is
all
you
have
many
other
pleasures
which
they
could
never
understand
you
enjoy
the
for
instance
but
also
you
can
suffer
many
things
they
can
not
understand
you
are
an
individual
while
they
are
merely
human
beings
gervasio
s
stepmother
married
a
husband
and
doubtless
loved
him
very
much
and
cried
for
him
a
week
after
he
was
dead
then
she
married
another
and
saw
no
difference
between
him
and
the
first
she
may
have
to
work
hard
and
she
may
be
hungry
sometimes
but
she
will
escape
the
worst
suffering
in
life
which
you
with
all
your
privileges
may
not
escape
one
would
rather
not
escape
it
she
answered
i
should
rather
feel
what
there
is
to
ah
he
breathed
so
should
we
all
and
these
poor
devils
of
peasants
who
can
t
feel
anything
but
their
hunger
and
weariness
lose
the
most
of
life
they
are
not
even
human
beings
they
are
merely
beasts
of
burden
patient
unthinking
oxen
who
go
the
way
they
are
driven
not
dreaming
of
their
strength
that
is
the
unfairness
that
is
where
society
owes
them
a
debt
they
have
no
chance
to
develop
however
he
broke
off
with
a
short
laugh
it
s
not
the
time
to
bother
you
with
other
people
s
your
birthday
night
we
will
hope
after
all
that
you
may
not
have
any
very
grave
ones
of
your
they
had
reached
the
fountain
and
they
paused
they
were
alone
in
a
fairy
grove
with
a
nightingale
pouring
out
his
soul
in
the
branches
above
their
heads
marcia
stood
looking
down
the
dim
green
alley
they
had
come
by
breathing
deeply
she
knew
that
sybert
s
eyes
were
on
her
and
slowly
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
up
in
his
face
for
a
moment
they
stood
in
silence
then
as
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
reached
them
from
the
avenue
she
started
and
turned
away
the
people
are
beginning
to
come
i
am
afraid
that
aunt
katherine
will
be
wondering
where
i
am
she
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
slightly
sybert
followed
her
in
silence
some
one
had
once
said
to
her
that
sybert
s
silences
meant
more
than
other
men
s
words
and
as
they
turned
back
she
tried
to
think
who
it
had
been
remembered
it
was
the
contessa
chapter
xix
throughout
the
evening
while
she
was
laughing
and
talking
with
the
stream
of
guests
marcia
kept
a
notion
of
sybert
s
movements
she
saw
him
in
the
hall
exchanging
jokes
with
the
english
ambassador
she
saw
him
talking
to
eleanor
royston
and
bending
over
the
contessa
torrenieri
and
once
as
she
whirled
past
in
a
waltz
she
caught
sight
of
his
dark
face
in
a
doorway
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
and
she
forgave
him
eleanor
and
the
contessa
she
was
conscious
all
the
time
of
a
secret
amazement
at
herself
sybert
had
suddenly
become
for
her
the
only
person
in
the
room
and
while
she
was
outwardly
intent
upon
what
other
men
were
saying
her
mind
was
filled
with
the
picture
of
his
face
as
he
had
looked
during
that
silent
moment
by
the
fountain
she
went
through
the
evening
in
a
maze
conscious
only
of
the
approach
of
the
one
dance
she
had
with
him
when
the
evening
was
nearing
its
end
she
was
suddenly
brought
to
her
senses
by
the
realization
that
she
was
strolling
down
one
of
the
ilex
walks
with
paul
dessart
at
her
side
she
had
been
rattling
on
unheedingly
and
she
scarcely
knew
how
they
had
come
there
her
first
instinct
was
one
of
she
felt
what
was
coming
and
she
wanted
to
ward
it
off
anything
to
get
back
to
the
crowd
again
she
paused
and
looked
back
at
the
lighted
villa
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
violins
rising
above
the
murmur
of
voices
and
laughter
for
a
moment
she
almost
felt
impelled
to
turn
and
run
since
she
had
stopped
paul
stopped
perforce
and
looked
at
her
questioningly
think
we
d
better
go
back
she
stammered
this
dance
is
almost
over
we
won
t
go
back
just
yet
he
returned
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
owe
me
a
few
moments
marcia
come
here
and
sit
down
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
he
turned
into
the
little
circle
by
the
fountain
and
motioned
toward
a
garden
seat
marcia
dropped
limply
upon
it
and
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
pleading
there
was
no
circumlocution
both
knew
that
the
time
had
come
when
everything
must
be
said
and
paul
went
to
the
point
well
marcia
are
you
going
to
marry
me
marcia
sat
opening
and
shutting
her
fan
nervously
trying
to
frame
an
answer
that
would
not
hurt
him
i
ve
been
patient
i
haven
t
bothered
you
you
surely
ought
to
know
your
own
mind
now
you
ve
had
a
hasn
t
been
exactly
a
happy
month
for
me
tell
me
please
marcia
don
t
keep
me
waiting
any
oh
paul
she
said
looking
back
with
eyes
it
s
all
a
a
mistake
what
do
you
mean
marcia
i
trusted
you
you
can
t
throw
me
over
now
tell
me
quickly
forgive
me
paul
she
faltered
miserably
was
mistaken
i
thought
that
day
in
the
he
realized
that
somehow
she
was
slipping
away
from
him
and
that
he
must
fight
to
get
her
back
he
bent
toward
her
and
took
her
hand
with
his
glowing
eager
face
close
to
hers
his
words
coming
so
fast
that
he
fairly
stuttered
yes
that
day
in
the
cloister
you
did
care
for
me
then
didn
t
you
a
little
bit
you
let
me
told
me
there
wasn
t
any
other
ve
been
kind
to
me
ever
since
that
s
what
i
ve
lived
on
this
whole
memory
of
that
afternoon
tell
me
what
the
trouble
t
let
anything
come
between
us
we
ve
had
such
a
happy
it
keep
on
being
happy
we
ve
lived
in
arcady
and
i
why
should
we
ever
leave
it
why
must
we
go
not
go
forward
if
you
cared
that
afternoon
you
can
care
now
i
haven
t
changed
tell
me
why
you
hesitate
i
don
t
want
to
force
you
to
make
up
your
mind
but
this
uncertainty
is
simply
marcia
listened
breathing
fast
half
carried
away
by
the
impetuous
flow
of
his
words
she
sat
watching
him
with
troubled
eyes
and
silent
lips
in
a
sort
of
stupor
she
could
not
collect
her
thoughts
sufficiently
to
answer
him
what
had
she
to
say
she
asked
herself
wildly
what
could
she
say
that
was
adequate
paul
bending
forward
his
eyes
close
to
hers
was
waiting
expectantly
insistently
for
her
to
speak
when
suddenly
they
were
startled
by
a
step
on
the
gravel
path
before
them
and
they
both
looked
up
to
see
laurence
sybert
cigarette
in
hand
stroll
around
the
corner
of
the
ilex
walk
as
his
eye
fell
upon
them
he
stopped
like
a
man
shot
and
for
a
breathless
instant
the
three
faced
one
another
then
with
a
quick
rigidity
of
his
whole
figure
he
bowed
an
apology
and
wheeled
about
marcia
turned
from
red
to
white
and
snatched
her
hand
away
paul
watched
her
a
moment
with
an
angry
light
growing
in
his
eyes
you
are
in
love
with
laurence
sybert
he
whispered
marcia
shrank
back
in
the
corner
and
hid
her
face
against
the
back
of
the
seat
paul
bent
over
her
look
at
me
he
cried
tell
me
it
s
not
true
you
can
t
do
it
you
ve
been
deceiving
me
you
ve
been
lying
oh
yes
i
know
you
ve
been
very
careful
not
to
make
any
promises
in
so
many
words
but
you
ve
made
them
in
other
ways
and
i
believed
you
i
ve
been
fool
enough
to
think
you
in
earnest
and
all
the
time
you
ve
been
amusing
yourself
marcia
raised
her
eyes
to
his
paul
i
haven
t
you
are
mistaken
i
don
t
know
how
i
ve
changed
i
can
t
explain
that
day
in
the
cloister
i
thought
i
liked
you
very
much
and
if
margaret
hadn
t
come
in
wouldn
t
have
deceived
you
for
a
moment
and
you
know
tell
me
you
don
t
love
paul
you
have
no
i
have
no
right
you
said
there
was
no
one
else
and
i
believed
you
and
now
when
i
ask
for
an
explanation
you
tell
me
to
go
about
my
business
i
suppose
you
were
beginning
to
get
tired
of
me
these
last
few
days
and
you
have
no
to
talk
to
me
this
way
i
haven
t
meant
to
deceive
you
you
asked
me
if
there
were
any
one
else
and
i
told
you
there
was
not
and
it
was
true
i
m
to
hurt
you
but
it
s
better
to
find
it
out
paul
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
very
hard
laugh
oh
yes
decidedly
it
s
better
to
find
it
out
now
it
would
have
been
still
better
if
you
had
found
it
out
he
turned
his
back
and
kicked
the
coping
of
the
fountain
viciously
marcia
crossed
over
to
him
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
paul
she
said
i
can
t
let
it
end
so
i
know
i
have
been
very
much
to
blame
but
not
as
you
think
i
liked
you
so
he
turned
and
saw
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
his
anger
vanished
oh
i
know
i
ve
no
business
to
speak
m
naturally
cut
up
you
know
don
t
cry
about
it
you
can
t
help
it
if
you
don
t
love
me
you
don
t
and
that
ends
the
matter
i
ll
get
over
it
he
smiled
a
trifle
bleakly
i
m
not
the
fellow
to
sit
down
and
cry
when
i
can
t
have
what
i
want
i
ve
gone
without
things
he
offered
her
his
arm
we
ll
go
back
now
i
m
afraid
you
re
missing
your
marcia
barely
touched
his
arm
and
they
turned
back
without
speaking
he
led
her
into
the
hall
and
bowing
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
turned
back
out
of
doors
she
laughed
and
chatted
her
way
through
two
or
three
groups
before
she
could
reach
the
stairs
and
escape
to
her
own
room
where
she
locked
the
door
and
sank
down
on
the
floor
by
the
couch
trouble
was
beginning
for
her
sooner
than
she
had
thought
and
underneath
the
remorse
and
pity
she
felt
for
paul
the
thing
that
lay
like
lead
on
her
heart
was
the
look
on
sybert
s
face
as
he
turned
away
a
knock
presently
came
on
the
door
followed
by
a
rattling
of
the
knob
marcia
marcia
called
eleanor
royston
are
you
in
there
marcia
raised
her
head
and
listened
in
silence
the
knock
came
again
she
rose
and
went
to
the
door
what
do
you
want
she
asked
i
want
to
come
in
it
s
open
the
door
why
don
t
you
come
down
marcia
shook
out
her
rumpled
skirts
pushed
back
her
hair
and
opened
the
door
everybody
s
asking
for
you
the
ambassador
says
you
were
engaged
to
him
for
why
what
s
the
matter
marcia
drew
back
quickly
into
the
shadow
and
eleanor
stepped
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
what
s
the
matter
child
she
inquired
again
you
ve
been
crying
has
she
asked
suddenly
eleanor
s
intuitive
faculties
were
abnormally
developed
i
suppose
he
was
pretty
nasty
she
proceeded
taking
marcia
s
answer
for
granted
he
can
be
on
occasion
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
he
has
some
cause
to
be
i
think
you
deserve
all
you
marcia
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
gesture
of
weariness
and
eleanor
walked
about
the
room
handling
the
ornaments
oh
i
knew
he
was
in
love
with
you
there
s
nothing
subtle
about
paul
he
wears
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
if
any
one
ever
did
but
if
you
don
t
mind
my
saying
so
marcia
i
think
you
ve
been
playing
with
rather
a
high
hand
it
s
hardly
legitimate
you
know
to
deliberately
set
out
to
make
a
man
fall
in
love
with
i
haven
t
been
playing
i
didn
t
mean
oh
nonsense
men
don
t
fall
in
love
without
a
little
encouragement
and
i
m
not
ve
been
watching
you
if
you
want
my
honest
opinion
i
think
you
ve
been
pretty
unfair
with
i
know
it
marcia
said
miserably
you
can
t
blame
me
any
worse
than
i
blame
myself
but
you
just
can
t
love
people
if
you
don
i
m
not
blaming
you
for
not
loving
him
it
s
for
his
loving
you
that
by
using
a
little
foresight
might
have
been
avoided
however
i
don
t
know
that
i
m
exactly
the
person
to
eleanor
dropped
into
a
chair
with
a
short
laugh
and
leaned
forward
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
on
marcia
s
face
i
have
a
theory
s
more
than
a
theory
it
s
a
superstition
some
day
we
ll
be
paid
in
our
own
coin
i
m
and
a
good
many
men
have
thought
they
were
in
love
with
me
while
i
myself
have
never
managed
to
fall
in
love
with
any
of
them
but
i
m
going
to
some
then
either
he
s
not
going
to
care
about
me
or
something
s
going
to
be
in
the
way
so
that
we
can
t
marry
it
s
going
to
be
a
tragedy
i
know
it
as
well
as
i
know
i
m
sitting
here
i
m
going
to
pay
for
my
nine
seasons
and
with
interest
it
makes
me
reckless
the
score
is
already
so
heavy
against
me
that
a
few
more
items
don
t
count
but
i
know
my
tragedy
s
coming
and
the
longer
i
put
it
off
the
worse
it
s
going
to
be
it
s
a
nice
superstition
i
ll
share
it
with
you
marcia
smiled
rather
sorrily
it
was
not
a
superstition
she
cared
to
have
thrust
upon
her
just
then
she
was
divining
it
for
herself
and
did
not
need
eleanor
to
put
it
into
words
as
for
paul
you
couldn
t
do
anything
else
of
course
you
re
not
fitted
to
each
other
for
a
moment
and
you
ll
grow
more
unfitted
every
day
paul
needs
some
one
who
is
more
doesn
t
think
too
one
like
margaret
for
instance
in
the
meantime
you
needn
t
worry
he
ll
manage
to
survive
she
rose
with
another
laugh
and
stood
over
marcia
s
chair
it
s
over
and
done
with
and
can
t
be
helped
there
s
nothing
to
cry
about
but
mark
my
words
marcia
copley
you
ll
be
falling
in
love
yourself
some
day
and
then
will
be
avenged
meanwhile
there
are
several
years
before
you
in
which
you
can
have
a
very
good
time
come
on
we
must
go
downstairs
the
people
will
be
leaving
in
a
little
while
bathe
your
eyes
and
i
ll
fix
your
marcia
went
downstairs
and
laughed
and
danced
and
talked
again
and
once
she
almost
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
to
wonder
how
she
could
do
it
it
was
finally
with
heartfelt
thankfulness
that
she
watched
the
people
beginning
to
leave
once
as
she
was
bidding
a
group
good
night
she
caught
sight
of
sybert
in
the
hall
bending
over
the
contessa
s
hand
she
covertly
studied
his
face
but
it
was
more
darkly
inscrutable
than
ever
she
slipped
upstairs
as
soon
as
the
last
carriage
had
rolled
away
it
was
not
until
long
after
the
sunlight
had
streamed
into
her
windows
however
that
she
finally
closed
her
eyes
eleanor
royston
s
pleasant
superstition
she
was
pondering
very
earnestly
chapter
xx
the
ball
ended
the
guests
gone
villa
vivalanti
forgot
its
one
burst
of
gaiety
and
settled
down
again
to
its
usual
state
of
peaceful
somnolence
the
days
were
growing
warmer
white
walls
simmering
in
the
sunshine
fragrant
garden
borders
resonant
with
the
hum
of
insects
the
cool
green
of
the
ilex
grove
the
sleepy
slow
drip
of
the
was
all
so
beautifully
italian
and
so
very
very
lonely
during
the
hot
marcia
would
sit
by
the
ruins
of
the
old
villa
or
pace
the
shady
ilex
walks
with
her
feelings
in
a
tumult
she
had
seen
neither
paul
dessart
nor
laurence
sybert
since
the
evening
of
her
birthday
and
that
moment
by
the
fountain
when
the
three
had
faced
each
other
silently
was
not
a
pleasant
memory
it
was
one
however
which
recurred
many
times
a
day
of
sybert
marcia
heard
no
news
whatever
in
reply
to
her
casual
question
as
to
when
he
would
be
at
the
villa
again
her
uncle
had
remarked
that
just
at
present
sybert
had
more
important
things
to
think
of
than
taking
a
villeggiatura
in
the
sabine
hills
but
of
paul
dessart
and
the
roystons
most
unexpected
news
had
come
paul
s
father
had
had
an
attack
brought
on
by
overwork
and
they
were
all
of
them
going
home
the
letters
were
written
on
the
train
for
cherbourg
a
long
letter
from
margaret
a
short
one
from
eleanor
the
latter
afforded
some
food
for
reflection
but
the
reflection
did
not
bring
enlightenment
dear
marcia
it
ran
i
am
sorry
not
to
see
you
again
and
to
be
quite
frank
i
am
equally
sorry
not
to
have
seen
sybert
again
i
feel
that
if
i
had
had
more
time
and
half
a
chance
i
might
have
accomplished
something
in
the
interests
of
science
margaret
told
you
of
course
that
paul
is
going
back
with
us
we
hope
his
father
s
illness
isn
t
serious
but
he
preferred
to
go
there
is
nothing
to
keep
him
in
rome
he
says
poor
fellow
you
must
write
him
a
nice
letter
don
t
worry
too
much
about
him
though
he
won
t
blow
his
brains
out
i
tell
you
something
i
have
just
the
tiniest
suggestion
of
a
suspicion
fair
winds
and
a
prosperous
arrive
at
the
dignity
of
news
by
the
time
we
reach
the
other
side
however
you
don
t
deserve
to
hear
it
and
i
shan
t
tell
have
i
aroused
your
curiosity
sufficiently
if
so
est
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
in
pittsburg
this
autumn
that
my
dear
marcia
is
merely
a
polite
phrase
and
is
not
strictly
true
i
shall
hope
rather
to
see
you
in
paris
or
rome
or
vienna
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
the
to
the
end
the
world
is
too
big
for
one
to
settle
down
permanently
in
one
that
place
pittsburg
is
it
not
so
one
can
never
be
happy
for
thinking
of
all
the
things
that
are
happening
in
all
of
the
places
where
one
is
not
au
then
till
autumn
we
ll
play
on
the
together
a
letter
had
come
also
from
marcia
s
father
which
put
her
in
an
uncomfortably
unsettled
frame
of
mind
it
was
written
in
the
copley
vein
of
humorous
appreciation
of
the
situation
but
for
all
that
she
could
see
underneath
that
she
had
hurt
him
he
disavowed
all
knowledge
and
culpability
in
the
triple
alliance
and
the
abyssinian
war
he
regretted
the
fact
that
the
taxes
were
heavy
but
he
had
had
no
hand
in
making
up
italy
s
financial
budget
as
to
wheat
there
were
many
reasons
why
italy
could
not
afford
it
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
was
dear
marcia
could
give
what
she
wished
to
the
peasants
to
make
up
for
her
erring
father
and
he
inclosed
a
blank
cheque
to
her
an
excessive
sign
of
penitence
on
the
part
of
a
business
man
the
letter
closed
with
the
statement
that
he
was
lonely
without
her
and
that
she
must
come
back
to
america
next
winter
and
keep
her
old
father
out
of
mischief
she
read
the
last
few
sentences
over
twice
with
a
rising
lump
in
her
throat
it
was
true
poor
man
he
must
be
lonely
she
ought
to
have
tried
to
take
her
mother
s
place
and
to
have
made
a
home
for
him
before
now
her
duty
suddenly
presented
itself
very
clearly
and
it
appeared
as
uninviting
as
duties
usually
do
a
few
months
before
she
would
not
have
minded
but
now
italy
had
got
its
hold
upon
her
she
did
not
wish
to
go
she
wished
only
to
sit
in
the
sunshine
happy
unthinking
and
let
the
days
slip
idly
by
a
picture
flashed
over
her
of
what
the
american
life
would
brownstone
house
on
fifth
avenue
in
the
winter
a
country
place
in
the
berkshires
in
the
summer
an
aunt
of
her
mother
s
for
chaperon
her
father
s
and
bankers
and
brokers
who
talked
railroads
and
the
stock
exchange
for
interests
she
would
have
balls
and
receptions
literary
clubs
and
charities
marcia
breathed
a
doleful
sigh
her
memories
of
the
new
york
house
were
dreary
it
was
not
a
life
she
cared
to
renew
but
nothing
of
all
this
did
she
let
her
father
know
she
sent
a
gracefully
forgiving
letter
with
the
promise
that
she
would
come
home
for
the
winter
and
not
a
hint
that
the
was
not
her
own
desire
it
seemed
that
things
having
once
commenced
to
change
everything
was
going
copley
himself
exploded
the
next
bombshell
he
came
back
from
rome
one
night
with
the
announcement
that
the
weather
was
getting
pretty
hot
and
the
family
ought
to
leave
next
week
for
switzerland
oh
uncle
howard
not
yet
marcia
cried
let
us
wait
until
the
end
of
june
it
isn
t
too
hot
till
then
up
here
in
the
hills
it
s
pleasant
all
summer
i
don
t
want
to
leave
the
rome
is
hot
just
now
in
more
ways
than
one
he
returned
i
d
feel
safer
to
have
you
in
switzerland
or
up
in
the
tyrol
during
the
excitement
goodness
only
knows
what
s
going
to
happen
next
i
m
expecting
to
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
a
french
revolution
every
morning
and
i
should
like
to
have
you
out
of
the
country
before
the
beheading
there
isn
t
really
any
danger
of
a
revolution
she
asked
breathlessly
not
in
a
country
where
every
other
man
s
a
soldier
and
the
government
s
in
command
but
there
have
been
houses
broken
into
and
a
good
many
acts
of
lawlessness
and
we
re
rather
lonely
off
i
hate
to
think
of
going
away
marcia
sighed
we
ll
come
back
in
the
autumn
won
t
we
uncle
howard
oh
yes
if
you
like
i
dare
say
we
could
manage
a
month
or
so
out
here
before
we
go
into
the
palazzo
for
the
and
i
ll
be
going
back
to
america
for
the
winter
she
sighed
he
looked
at
her
with
a
slight
smile
are
you
the
girl
marcia
who
used
to
preach
sermons
to
your
uncle
about
americans
living
abroad
marcia
reflected
his
smile
somewhat
wanly
and
i
m
practising
my
own
preaching
am
i
not
oh
well
he
said
when
the
time
comes
you
can
do
as
you
please
your
father
can
get
along
without
you
one
year
no
i
think
i
ought
to
go
for
of
course
he
must
be
lonely
should
like
to
stay
it
seems
more
like
home
than
any
place
i
ve
ever
been
in
i
ve
really
never
anywhere
before
and
i
like
so
much
to
be
with
poor
little
girl
you
have
had
a
chequered
yes
uncle
howard
i
have
and
it
keeps
on
being
chequered
i
haven
t
been
in
the
villa
three
months
but
really
i
don
t
remember
ever
having
lived
so
long
in
one
place
before
it
s
been
nice
hasn
t
it
i
hate
dreadfully
to
have
it
end
it
seems
like
shutting
away
a
whole
part
of
my
life
that
can
never
come
oh
well
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
ll
buy
the
villa
and
we
can
come
out
every
spring
you
can
bring
your
father
over
and
we
will
dip
him
in
the
waters
of
lethe
i
m
afraid
he
wouldn
t
be
dipped
she
laughed
he
d
be
running
a
cable
connexion
out
here
and
setting
up
a
ticker
on
the
terrace
so
that
he
could
watch
the
stock
market
as
well
as
the
copley
s
mouth
twitched
slightly
at
the
picture
we
must
all
ride
our
hobbies
i
suppose
or
the
world
would
be
a
very
dreary
world
she
looked
up
at
him
and
hesitated
uncle
howard
do
you
and
you
mind
my
asking
you
very
good
friends
copley
frowned
a
moment
without
replying
well
marcia
he
s
a
good
deal
older
than
i
and
we
re
not
particularly
he
straightened
his
shoulders
with
a
laugh
oh
well
there
s
no
use
concealing
disagreeable
truths
it
appears
they
will
out
in
the
end
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
father
and
i
haven
t
had
anything
to
do
with
each
other
for
the
past
ten
years
the
first
move
was
on
his
part
when
he
wrote
about
you
last
didn
t
know
that
you
came
as
an
did
you
i
didn
t
know
he
didn
t
tell
me
anything
about
it
but
i
sort
of
guessed
i
m
sorry
about
it
uncle
howard
i
m
sure
that
it
s
just
because
you
don
t
understand
each
i
m
afraid
we
never
have
understood
each
other
and
i
doubt
if
we
ever
can
but
we
ll
make
another
it
s
so
hard
to
like
people
when
you
don
t
understand
them
and
so
easy
when
you
do
said
marcia
it
facilitates
matters
he
agreed
i
think
i
m
beginning
to
understand
sybert
she
added
somewhat
vaguely
he
s
different
when
you
understand
him
from
the
way
you
thought
he
was
when
you
didn
t
understand
ah
sybert
copley
raised
his
head
and
brought
his
eyes
back
from
the
edge
of
the
landscape
i
thought
i
knew
him
but
he
s
been
a
revelation
to
me
this
how
do
you
mean
marcia
asked
striving
to
keep
out
of
her
tone
the
interest
that
was
behind
it
oh
the
way
he
s
taken
hold
of
things
it
seems
an
absurd
thing
to
say
but
i
believe
he
s
had
almost
as
much
influence
as
the
police
in
quieting
the
trouble
he
has
an
unbelievably
strong
hold
on
the
he
got
it
i
don
t
know
he
understands
them
as
well
as
an
italian
and
yet
he
is
a
foreigner
which
gives
him
in
some
ways
a
great
advantage
they
trust
him
because
they
think
that
being
a
foreigner
he
has
nothing
to
make
out
of
it
he
s
a
marvellous
fellow
when
it
comes
to
you
never
would
guess
it
to
look
at
him
she
returned
why
does
he
pretend
to
be
so
bored
be
so
bored
well
i
suppose
there
are
some
things
that
do
bore
him
and
the
ones
that
don
t
bore
other
people
his
opinions
are
not
universally
popular
in
rome
and
being
a
diplomatist
i
dare
say
he
thinks
it
as
well
to
keep
them
to
what
are
his
opinions
she
asked
tentatively
i
don
t
like
to
accuse
him
of
being
an
anarchist
since
he
assures
me
that
he
s
not
but
when
a
man
wants
to
overthrow
the
nonsense
sybert
doesn
t
want
to
overthrow
the
government
any
more
than
i
do
just
at
present
it
s
under
the
control
of
a
few
corrupt
politicians
but
that
s
a
thing
that
s
likely
to
happen
in
any
country
and
it
s
only
a
temporary
evil
the
italians
will
be
on
their
feet
again
in
a
year
or
so
all
the
better
for
their
and
sybert
knows
it
he
s
got
more
real
faith
in
the
government
than
most
of
the
italians
i
but
he
talks
against
it
well
he
sees
the
evil
he
s
been
looking
at
it
pretty
closely
and
he
knows
it
s
there
and
when
sybert
feels
a
thing
he
feels
it
strongly
but
copley
smiled
while
he
says
things
himself
against
the
country
you
ll
find
he
ll
not
let
any
one
else
say
what
do
people
think
about
him
mixed
up
in
all
these
riots
oh
just
now
he
s
mixed
up
in
the
right
side
and
the
officials
are
very
willing
to
pat
him
on
the
back
but
as
for
the
populace
i
m
afraid
he
s
not
making
himself
they
have
a
most
immoral
tendency
to
sympathize
with
the
side
that
s
against
the
law
and
they
can
t
understand
their
friends
not
sympathizing
with
the
same
side
it
s
a
pretty
hard
thing
for
him
to
have
to
tell
these
poor
fellows
to
be
quiet
and
go
back
to
their
work
and
starve
in
copley
sighed
and
folded
his
arms
i
am
sorry
marcia
you
don
t
like
sybert
better
there
are
not
many
like
marcia
let
the
observation
pass
without
comment
the
next
morning
as
copley
and
marcia
were
sitting
on
the
loggia
listlessly
engaged
with
books
and
embroidery
there
came
whirring
down
the
avenue
the
contessa
s
immaculate
little
victoria
with
the
yellow
coronet
emblazoned
on
the
sides
with
the
coachman
and
footman
in
the
torrenieri
livery
green
with
yellow
pipings
it
was
a
gay
little
affair
it
matched
the
contessa
she
stepped
out
pretty
and
debonair
in
a
fluttering
summer
gown
and
ran
forward
to
the
loggia
with
a
little
exclamation
of
distress
signora
i
am
desolated
we
must
part
is
it
not
sad
i
go
with
bartolomeo
bartolomeo
was
the
count
to
plant
olive
orchards
on
his
estate
in
the
abruzzi
is
it
not
lonely
spend
the
summer
in
an
empty
castle
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
with
only
a
view
for
company
and
my
friends
at
the
baths
or
the
lakes
or
in
switzerland
everywhere
except
on
my
marcia
laughed
at
the
contessa
s
despair
but
why
do
you
go
contessa
if
you
do
not
like
it
she
inquired
but
my
husband
likes
it
he
has
a
passion
for
farming
after
roulette
it
it
his
chief
amusement
he
is
very
he
adores
the
mountain
and
the
view
and
the
olive
orchards
and
in
italy
signorina
the
wife
has
to
do
as
the
husband
i
m
afraid
the
wives
have
to
do
that
the
world
over
ah
no
signorina
you
can
not
tell
me
that
i
have
seen
in
america
the
husband
does
as
the
wife
wishes
it
is
a
beautiful
country
truly
you
have
many
charming
customs
yes
i
will
give
you
good
advice
you
will
be
wise
to
marry
an
american
they
do
not
like
but
perhaps
you
will
visit
me
on
my
she
asked
the
the
beautiful
view
it
is
not
so
i
m
afraid
not
contessa
we
are
leaving
for
the
tyrol
ourselves
a
week
from
so
soon
every
one
is
going
truly
the
world
comes
to
an
end
next
week
in
marcia
found
herself
growing
unexpectedly
cordial
toward
their
guest
even
the
contessa
appeared
suddenly
dear
as
she
was
about
to
be
snatched
away
she
bade
her
an
almost
affectionate
farewell
and
stood
by
the
balustrade
waving
her
handkerchief
until
the
carriage
disappeared
will
marvels
never
cease
she
asked
her
aunt
i
really
think
that
i
like
the
contessa
chapter
xxi
the
next
was
just
a
week
before
their
proposed
trip
to
the
accompanied
her
uncle
into
rome
for
the
sake
of
one
or
two
important
errands
which
might
not
be
intrusted
to
a
man
s
uncertain
memory
copley
found
himself
unready
to
return
to
the
villa
on
the
train
they
had
planned
to
take
and
somewhat
to
marcia
s
consternation
he
carried
her
off
to
the
embassy
for
tea
she
mounted
the
steps
with
a
heart
would
laurence
sybert
be
there
she
had
not
so
much
as
seen
him
since
the
night
of
her
birthday
ball
and
the
thought
of
facing
him
before
a
crowd
with
no
chance
to
explain
away
that
awful
moment
by
the
fountain
was
more
than
disconcerting
her
first
glance
about
the
room
assured
her
that
he
was
not
in
it
and
the
knowledge
carried
with
it
a
mingled
feeling
of
relief
and
disappointment
the
air
was
filled
with
an
excited
buzz
of
conversation
the
talk
being
all
of
riots
and
rumours
of
riots
marcia
drifted
from
one
group
to
another
and
finally
found
herself
sitting
on
a
beside
a
woman
whose
face
was
familiar
but
whom
for
the
moment
she
could
not
place
you
don
t
remember
me
miss
copley
her
companion
smiled
marcia
looked
puzzled
i
was
trying
to
place
you
she
confessed
i
remember
your
one
day
early
this
spring
at
dessart
s
to
be
sure
the
lady
who
writes
she
laughed
i
never
caught
your
and
the
worst
gossip
in
rome
ah
well
they
slandered
me
miss
copley
one
is
naturally
interested
in
the
lives
of
the
people
one
is
interested
for
the
others
they
may
make
their
fortunes
and
lose
them
again
and
get
married
and
elope
and
die
for
all
the
attention
i
ever
marcia
smiled
at
her
concise
summary
of
the
activities
of
life
and
put
her
down
as
a
frenchwoman
and
the
villa
in
the
hills
she
asked
how
did
it
go
and
the
ghost
of
the
wicked
prince
did
monsieur
benoit
paint
him
the
ghost
was
a
grievous
disappointment
he
turned
out
to
be
the
monsieur
benoit
he
has
many
disappointments
est
triste
n
pas
many
disappointments
queried
marcia
quite
in
the
dark
the
miss
roystons
dessart
s
relatives
pursued
the
lady
they
are
friends
of
yours
i
met
them
at
the
melvilles
a
few
weeks
ago
they
are
charming
are
they
not
very
said
marcia
wondering
slightly
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
and
this
poor
monsieur
has
gone
all
alone
to
paint
moonlight
in
venice
que
c
est
que
l
amour
ah
breathed
marcia
she
was
beginning
to
have
an
inkling
had
he
been
added
to
the
collection
it
was
too
bad
of
eleanor
miss
royston
is
charming
like
all
americans
reiterated
the
lady
but
i
fear
a
little
cruel
n
he
is
young
and
when
one
is
young
one
s
heart
is
made
of
is
it
not
so
her
eyes
rested
on
marcia
for
a
moment
marcia
s
glance
had
wandered
toward
the
door
laurence
sybert
had
just
come
in
and
joined
the
group
about
her
uncle
and
she
noted
the
fact
with
a
quick
thrill
of
excitement
would
he
come
and
speak
to
her
what
would
he
say
how
would
he
act
she
felt
a
strong
desire
to
study
his
face
but
she
was
aware
that
the
eyes
of
the
greatest
gossip
in
rome
were
upon
her
and
she
rallied
herself
to
answer
monsieur
benoit
was
commiserated
for
the
third
time
ah
well
finished
the
lady
philosophically
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
a
young
man
le
cœur
is
far
more
interesting
than
one
who
is
there
is
that
laurence
sybert
over
she
nodded
toward
the
group
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
for
the
last
ten
years
when
the
in
rome
haven
t
had
anything
else
to
talk
about
they
ve
talked
about
him
and
all
because
they
think
that
under
that
manner
of
his
he
s
carrying
around
a
broken
heart
for
the
pretty
little
contessa
marcia
laughed
lightly
mr
sybert
at
least
carries
his
broken
heart
easily
one
would
never
suspect
its
the
lady
s
eyes
rested
upon
her
an
appreciable
instant
before
she
answered
vuole
people
must
have
something
to
talk
about
and
a
good
many
and
with
sighed
in
vain
for
a
smile
from
his
dark
eyes
between
you
and
me
i
don
t
believe
the
man
s
got
any
broken
or
whole
but
i
mustn
t
be
slandering
him
she
laughed
i
remember
he
s
a
friend
at
casa
mr
sybert
is
my
uncle
s
friend
the
rest
of
us
see
very
little
of
him
marcia
returned
as
she
endeavoured
to
think
of
a
new
theme
her
companion
however
saved
her
the
trouble
and
were
you
not
surprised
at
dessart
s
desertion
mr
dessart
s
desertion
marcia
repeated
the
question
with
a
slight
quiver
of
the
eyelids
exchanging
rome
for
pittsburg
you
americans
do
things
so
suddenly
one
loses
one
s
but
his
father
was
ill
and
they
sent
for
yes
but
the
surprising
part
is
that
he
goes
for
good
the
pictures
and
carvings
and
curios
are
packed
there
is
a
card
in
the
window
saying
the
studio
is
for
is
giving
up
art
to
mine
coal
marcia
laughed
it
is
a
step
from
art
to
coal
she
acknowledged
i
had
thought
myself
that
he
was
an
artist
to
the
was
an
artist
because
he
was
young
not
because
he
was
called
and
i
suppose
he
got
tired
of
the
play
the
real
artist
for
is
that
poor
young
man
painting
moonlight
in
the
lady
tapped
marcia
s
arm
gently
with
her
fan
but
you
and
i
know
miss
copley
that
paul
dessart
never
went
back
to
america
just
from
homesickness
when
a
young
man
hasn
t
reached
thirty
yet
you
may
be
pretty
sure
of
finding
a
woman
behind
most
of
his
marcia
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
the
lady
s
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
a
speculative
light
in
their
depths
she
endeavoured
to
look
disinterested
as
she
again
cast
about
for
a
more
propitious
topic
glancing
up
she
saw
that
her
uncle
accompanied
by
laurence
sybert
and
and
melville
was
crossing
the
room
in
their
direction
sybert
who
was
laughing
and
chatting
easily
with
melville
apparently
did
not
feel
that
there
was
any
awkwardness
in
the
moment
he
delivered
a
cordially
indifferent
bow
which
was
evidently
meant
to
be
divided
between
marcia
and
her
companion
after
a
moment
or
so
of
general
greetings
marcia
found
herself
talking
with
melville
while
her
uncle
and
the
still
discussed
riots
and
the
lady
who
wrote
appropriated
sybert
we
are
sorry
to
hear
you
are
leaving
the
villa
so
early
though
i
suppose
we
shall
all
be
following
in
a
week
or
so
said
melville
one
clings
pretty
closely
to
the
shady
side
of
the
street
even
now
aren
t
these
riots
dreadful
she
rambled
on
poor
laurence
sybert
is
working
himself
thin
over
them
it
is
the
only
subject
one
hears
marcia
achieved
an
intelligent
reply
while
at
the
same
time
she
found
herself
listening
to
the
conversation
on
the
other
side
to
her
intense
discomfort
it
was
still
of
paul
dessart
yes
i
heard
that
he
had
been
suddenly
called
home
that
was
hard
luck
said
sybert
quietly
between
you
and
me
paul
dessart
never
gave
up
art
and
went
back
to
pittsburg
because
he
was
tired
of
rome
as
i
told
miss
copley
when
a
young
man
decides
to
settle
down
and
be
serious
you
may
mark
my
words
there
s
a
woman
in
the
case
oh
i
knew
it
all
the
she
lowered
her
tone
we
ll
be
reading
of
an
engagement
in
the
paris
one
of
these
i
dare
say
as
usual
you
re
right
sybert
said
dryly
while
marcia
inwardly
raging
and
outwardly
smiling
gave
ear
to
melville
again
oh
did
i
tell
you
melville
asked
that
we
are
coming
out
to
the
villa
next
saturday
for
it
s
a
invitation
that
we
ve
never
found
a
chance
to
accept
but
it
s
so
charming
out
there
that
we
can
t
bear
to
miss
it
and
so
we
are
throwing
over
all
our
other
engagements
in
order
to
get
out
this
week
before
you
break
marcia
murmured
some
polite
phrases
while
she
tried
to
catch
the
gist
of
the
conversation
on
the
other
side
it
was
not
of
paul
dessart
she
reassured
herself
the
woman
who
wrote
was
narrating
an
adventure
with
some
of
the
society
and
the
two
and
chaffing
her
uncle
the
point
of
the
story
appeared
to
be
against
him
he
finally
broke
away
and
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
turned
back
to
his
niece
well
marcia
if
we
are
to
catch
that
clock
train
i
think
it
is
time
that
we
were
sybert
accompanied
them
to
the
door
talking
riots
to
her
uncle
while
she
went
on
ahead
feeling
forgotten
and
overlooked
melville
joined
them
again
in
the
vestibule
and
the
three
fell
to
discussing
barricades
and
soldiers
until
copley
with
another
look
at
his
watch
laughingly
declared
that
they
must
run
sybert
for
the
first
time
marcia
thought
gave
any
sign
of
being
aware
of
her
presence
well
miss
marcia
he
said
turning
toward
her
with
a
friendly
smile
your
uncle
says
that
you
are
talking
of
going
back
to
america
next
winter
that
is
too
bad
but
we
shall
hope
to
see
a
little
of
you
in
the
autumn
before
you
leave
you
are
going
to
the
tyrol
for
the
summer
i
hear
that
will
be
pleasant
at
you
talk
as
if
america
were
a
terrible
hardship
said
marcia
taking
her
tone
from
him
sybert
laughed
with
his
old
shrug
ah
well
it
depends
on
where
one
s
interests
are
i
she
suddenly
flushed
again
with
the
thought
that
he
was
referring
to
paul
dessart
and
she
plunged
blindly
into
another
subject
to
cover
her
confusion
did
uncle
howard
tell
you
that
we
have
decided
to
take
gervasio
with
us
for
the
summer
he
wanted
to
find
a
home
for
him
in
rome
i
wanted
to
take
him
with
us
aunt
katherine
hadn
t
made
up
her
mind
until
gerald
cried
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
him
and
as
usual
gerald
s
tears
decided
the
it
was
a
most
fortunate
whipping
for
gervasio
the
night
that
we
drove
by
he
returned
as
he
held
out
his
hand
well
miss
marcia
as
you
break
up
next
week
i
shall
probably
not
see
you
again
i
hope
that
you
will
have
a
delightful
marcia
shook
hands
smilingly
with
her
heart
sunk
fathoms
deep
he
followed
them
to
the
carriage
for
a
last
word
with
her
uncle
you
d
better
change
your
mind
sybert
and
come
out
to
the
villa
saturday
night
with
the
melvilles
copley
called
as
the
carriage
started
i
m
sorry
but
i
m
afraid
there
s
too
much
excitement
elsewhere
for
me
to
afford
a
vacation
just
now
and
he
bowed
a
smiling
to
marcia
chapter
xxii
the
next
few
days
were
anxious
ones
for
italy
the
of
tuscany
were
marching
into
florence
with
the
cry
o
lavore
bread
or
work
in
the
north
not
bread
but
revolution
was
openly
the
watchword
timid
tourists
who
had
no
desire
to
be
mixed
up
in
another
were
scurrying
across
the
frontiers
into
france
and
switzerland
adventurous
gentlemen
from
the
riviera
eager
to
enjoy
the
fun
and
not
unwilling
to
take
advantage
of
a
universal
tumult
were
gaily
scrambling
in
the
ministry
jostled
from
its
usual
apathy
had
vigorously
set
itself
to
suppressing
real
and
imaginary
plots
opposition
newspapers
were
sequestered
and
the
editors
thrown
into
jail
telegrams
and
letters
were
withheld
public
meetings
broken
up
and
men
arrested
in
the
streets
for
singing
the
hymn
of
the
secret
police
worked
night
and
day
every
café
and
theatre
and
crowd
had
its
spies
disguised
as
loungers
and
none
dared
speak
the
truth
to
his
neighbour
for
fear
his
neighbour
was
in
the
pay
of
the
premier
in
milan
the
rioters
had
been
lashed
into
a
frenzy
by
their
first
taste
of
blood
and
for
three
days
the
future
of
united
italy
looked
dark
wagons
and
tramcars
were
overturned
in
the
streets
to
make
barricades
roofs
and
windows
rained
down
tiles
and
stones
and
the
soldiers
obeyed
but
sullenly
when
ordered
to
fire
upon
the
mob
in
their
hearts
many
of
them
sympathized
the
socialists
were
out
in
force
and
working
hard
and
their
motto
was
spread
the
discontent
priests
and
students
from
the
universities
were
stirring
up
the
peasants
in
the
fields
and
urging
them
on
to
revolt
all
dissatisfied
classes
were
for
the
moment
united
in
their
desire
to
overthrow
the
existing
government
what
should
take
its
place
could
be
decided
later
when
savoy
was
ousted
then
the
republicans
the
priests
the
socialists
the
hungry
mob
in
the
fight
it
out
among
themselves
and
as
each
faction
in
its
heart
believed
itself
to
be
the
strongest
the
fight
if
it
should
come
was
like
to
prove
the
end
of
italy
while
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
was
filled
with
tumult
only
faint
echoes
reached
villa
vivalanti
dozing
peacefully
in
the
midst
of
its
hills
marcia
sitting
with
folded
hands
fretted
uselessly
at
her
forced
inaction
she
scarcely
left
the
villa
grounds
she
was
carrying
out
sybert
s
suggestion
far
more
literally
than
he
had
meant
it
she
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
face
the
countryside
it
seemed
as
if
every
peasant
knew
about
the
wheat
and
followed
her
with
accusing
eyes
even
the
villa
servants
appeared
to
her
awakened
sensibilities
to
go
about
their
duties
perfunctorily
as
if
they
too
shared
the
general
distrust
in
their
employers
the
last
week
dragged
slowly
to
its
end
there
were
only
four
more
days
to
be
spent
in
the
villa
and
marcia
now
was
impatient
to
leave
it
she
wanted
to
get
up
into
the
out
of
she
need
never
hear
the
word
wheat
again
that
the
melvilles
were
to
spend
at
the
oppressively
hot
it
was
a
foretaste
of
what
rome
could
do
in
midsummer
not
a
leaf
was
stirring
there
was
no
suggestion
of
mist
on
the
hills
and
the
sun
beat
down
glaringly
upon
a
gaudily
coloured
landscape
the
outer
walls
of
the
villa
fairly
sizzled
in
the
light
but
inside
the
atmosphere
was
respectably
tempered
the
green
venetian
blinds
had
been
dropped
over
the
windows
the
rugs
rolled
back
and
the
floors
sprinkled
with
water
the
afternoon
sun
might
do
its
worst
outside
but
the
large
airy
rooms
were
dark
and
quiet
half
an
hour
before
the
walls
had
echoed
gerald
s
despairing
cry
i
won
t
go
to
sleep
i
go
to
sleep
for
gerald
was
a
true
copley
and
he
took
his
siestas
hardly
but
he
had
eventually
dropped
off
in
the
midst
of
his
revolt
and
all
was
quiet
now
when
marcia
issued
from
her
room
garden
hat
in
hand
she
paused
with
a
light
foot
at
gerald
s
door
the
little
fellow
was
spread
out
face
downward
on
the
bed
his
arms
and
legs
thrown
to
the
four
winds
marcia
smiled
upon
the
little
clenched
fists
and
damp
yellow
curls
and
tiptoed
downstairs
on
a
pile
of
rugs
in
the
lower
hall
gervasio
and
marcellus
were
curled
up
together
sleeping
peacefully
and
happily
she
smiled
a
blessing
on
them
also
next
to
gerald
gervasio
was
the
dearest
little
fellow
in
the
world
and
marcellus
the
dearest
and
the
homeliest
dog
she
raised
the
blind
and
stepped
on
to
the
loggia
a
blast
of
hot
air
struck
her
and
she
hesitated
dubiously
it
was
scarcely
the
weather
for
an
afternoon
stroll
but
the
ilex
grove
looked
cool
and
inviting
and
she
finally
made
a
courageous
dash
across
the
terrace
and
plunged
gratefully
into
its
shady
fastnesses
the
world
outside
the
little
realm
of
green
was
an
untempered
glare
of
heat
and
colour
the
only
sounds
which
smote
the
drowsy
air
were
the
drip
drip
of
the
fountain
and
the
murmurous
drone
of
insects
in
the
borders
of
the
garden
marcia
paused
by
the
fountain
and
dropping
down
upon
the
coping
dipped
her
fingers
idly
in
the
water
shaking
the
drops
of
water
from
her
fingers
she
rose
and
stood
a
moment
looking
down
the
green
alley
she
had
come
by
toward
the
sunny
blaze
of
terrace
at
the
end
she
closed
her
eyes
and
pictured
it
as
it
had
looked
on
her
birthday
night
a
fairy
scene
with
the
tiny
bulbs
of
coloured
light
glowing
among
the
branches
she
pictured
sybert
s
face
as
he
had
stood
beside
her
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
moment
would
come
back
again
if
she
only
thought
about
it
hard
enough
and
then
the
remembrance
of
that
other
moment
followed
and
the
expression
on
sybert
s
face
as
he
had
turned
away
what
did
he
think
she
asked
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
and
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
fountain
and
hurried
down
the
laurel
walk
as
if
to
shut
the
memory
out
the
wheat
field
was
ablaze
with
flaming
poppies
the
reds
and
yellows
were
so
crude
that
no
artist
would
have
dared
to
paint
them
in
their
untoned
brilliancy
marcia
paused
to
study
the
effect
her
eyes
wandered
from
this
daring
foreground
across
scarcely
less
brilliant
olive
groves
and
vineyards
to
castel
vivalanti
on
its
an
irregular
mass
of
yellow
ochre
against
a
sky
of
cobalt
blue
there
was
no
attempt
at
shading
the
colours
were
as
unaffectedly
primary
as
an
illumination
from
some
old
manuscript
or
as
the
outlines
a
child
fills
in
from
his
tin
box
of
half
a
dozen
little
cakes
of
paint
this
italy
was
so
uncompromising
in
her
moods
no
variant
note
was
allowed
to
creep
in
to
mar
the
effect
she
was
striving
for
marcia
recalled
the
sudden
storm
of
the
mountain
how
fiercely
untamed
how
intense
it
had
been
she
thought
of
the
moonlight
nights
of
the
spring
when
the
mood
was
soft
outline
of
tower
and
rain
the
songs
of
nightingales
the
heavy
odours
of
acacia
and
magnolia
blossoms
italy
was
an
impressionist
and
her
children
were
like
her
there
were
no
in
the
italian
nature
any
more
than
in
the
italian
landscape
there
were
many
varying
moods
but
each
in
itself
was
concentrated
just
now
there
were
storms
perhaps
but
before
long
there
would
be
moonlight
and
singing
and
again
and
the
clouds
would
be
forgotten
she
strolled
on
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
villa
and
sat
down
among
the
crumbling
arches
she
was
in
a
very
different
mood
herself
than
on
that
other
afternoon
of
the
early
spring
when
paul
dessart
had
found
her
there
she
thought
of
the
little
sketch
he
had
painted
and
recalled
her
own
words
as
he
gave
it
to
her
i
will
keep
it
to
remember
you
and
the
villa
by
when
i
go
home
to
the
words
had
been
spoken
lightly
but
now
they
sounded
prophetic
everything
had
seemed
before
her
then
now
all
seemed
behind
a
few
months
more
and
she
would
be
back
in
america
with
possibly
nothing
more
than
the
sketch
to
remember
her
life
in
italy
it
had
meant
so
much
to
her
now
that
it
was
slipping
away
she
realized
how
much
she
seemed
to
have
grown
more
to
have
felt
more
than
in
all
her
life
before
and
she
hated
inexpressibly
to
leave
it
behind
crossing
to
the
little
grotto
that
had
formed
the
subject
of
the
picture
she
stood
gazing
pensively
at
the
dilapidated
pile
of
stones
the
afternoon
when
paul
had
sketched
it
seemed
years
before
in
reality
it
was
not
two
months
she
thought
of
him
as
he
had
looked
that
enthusiastic
and
young
and
she
thought
of
him
without
a
tremor
many
things
had
changed
since
then
and
she
had
changed
with
them
if
only
eleanor
s
suspicion
might
be
true
that
he
would
come
to
care
for
margaret
she
clung
to
the
suggestion
eleanor
s
superstition
need
trouble
her
no
more
paul
would
not
need
to
be
avenged
she
turned
aside
and
as
she
did
so
something
caught
her
eyes
she
leaned
over
to
look
and
then
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
a
man
was
lying
asleep
almost
at
her
feet
hidden
by
the
tall
weeds
that
choked
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
the
first
involuntary
thought
that
flashed
to
her
mind
was
of
gervasio
s
stepfather
but
immediately
she
knew
that
he
was
not
the
sleeper
gervasio
s
stepfather
was
old
with
a
grizzled
beard
it
was
evident
that
this
man
was
young
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
hat
was
pulled
across
his
eyes
she
laughed
at
her
own
fear
it
was
some
peasant
who
had
come
from
the
fields
to
rest
in
the
shade
she
leaned
over
to
look
again
and
as
she
did
so
her
heart
suddenly
leaped
into
her
mouth
the
man
s
shirt
was
open
at
the
throat
and
there
was
a
crucifix
tattooed
upside
down
upon
his
breast
for
a
second
she
stood
staring
powerless
to
move
the
next
she
was
running
wildly
across
the
blazing
wheat
field
toward
the
shelter
of
the
villa
with
a
frightened
glance
behind
at
the
shadow
of
the
cypresses
chapter
xxiii
marcia
passed
the
afternoon
in
a
state
of
nervous
impatience
for
her
uncle
s
return
she
said
nothing
to
copley
of
the
man
she
had
found
asleep
in
the
grotto
and
the
effort
to
preserve
an
outward
serenity
added
no
little
to
her
inner
trepidation
in
vain
she
tried
to
reason
with
her
fear
it
was
not
a
subject
which
responded
to
logic
she
assured
herself
over
and
over
again
that
the
man
could
not
be
the
same
neapolitan
who
had
warned
her
uncle
that
he
was
safely
in
prison
and
that
the
tattooed
crucifix
was
only
the
general
mark
of
a
secret
society
the
assurance
did
not
carry
conviction
her
first
startled
impression
had
been
too
deep
to
be
thrown
off
lightly
and
coming
just
then
in
the
midst
of
the
rioting
and
lawlessness
the
incident
carried
additional
force
she
had
lately
heard
many
stories
of
lonely
villas
being
broken
into
of
travellers
on
the
campagna
being
waylaid
and
robbed
of
the
vindictiveness
of
the
camorra
which
her
uncle
had
opposed
the
stories
were
not
reassuring
and
though
she
resolutely
put
them
out
of
her
mind
she
found
herself
thinking
of
them
again
and
again
italy
s
elaborate
police
system
she
knew
was
not
merely
for
show
copley
and
the
melvilles
were
due
at
five
but
as
they
had
not
appeared
by
copley
decided
that
they
had
missed
their
train
and
she
and
marcia
sat
down
to
more
accurately
to
iced
waiting
the
table
was
set
under
the
shade
of
the
ilex
trees
where
the
grove
met
the
upper
end
of
the
terrace
and
where
any
slight
breeze
that
chanced
to
be
stirring
would
find
them
out
gerald
and
gervasio
swallowed
their
allotted
glassful
and
two
with
dispatch
and
withdrew
to
the
cool
shadows
of
the
ilex
grove
to
play
at
horse
with
poor
patient
bianca
and
the
streaming
ribbons
of
her
cap
copley
and
marcia
took
the
repast
in
more
leisurely
fashion
with
snatches
of
very
intermittent
conversation
marcia
s
eyes
wandered
in
the
pauses
to
the
wheat
field
and
the
cypresses
beyond
i
believe
they
are
coming
after
all
copley
finally
exclaimed
as
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
looked
down
across
the
open
stretch
of
vineyards
to
where
the
roman
road
a
yellow
ribbon
of
dust
divided
the
fields
yes
that
is
the
carriage
marcia
looked
at
the
moving
speck
and
shook
her
head
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
aunt
katherine
if
you
can
recognize
uncle
howard
at
this
the
carriage
is
turning
up
our
road
i
am
sure
it
is
they
poor
things
i
am
afraid
they
will
be
nearly
dead
after
the
drive
in
this
heat
rome
must
have
been
unbearable
and
she
hastily
dispatched
pietro
to
prepare
more
iced
drinks
ten
minutes
later
however
the
carriage
had
resolved
itself
into
a
jangling
campagna
and
the
two
resigned
themselves
to
waiting
again
by
seven
marcia
was
growing
frankly
nervous
could
anything
have
happened
to
her
uncle
should
she
have
told
her
aunt
and
sent
some
one
to
meet
him
with
a
warning
message
surely
no
one
would
dare
to
stop
the
carriage
on
the
open
road
in
broad
daylight
a
hundred
wild
imaginings
were
chasing
through
her
brain
when
finally
close
upon
eight
the
rumble
of
wheels
sounded
on
the
avenue
both
copley
and
marcia
uttered
an
exclamation
of
relief
copley
had
been
worried
on
the
score
of
the
dinner
and
marcia
for
any
number
of
reasons
which
disappeared
with
the
knowledge
that
her
uncle
was
safe
they
hurried
out
to
the
loggia
to
meet
the
and
as
the
carriage
drew
up
not
only
did
the
melvilles
and
copley
descend
but
laurence
sybert
as
well
at
sight
of
him
marcia
hung
back
asking
herself
with
a
quickly
beating
heart
why
he
had
come
copley
with
the
first
glance
at
their
faces
interrupted
her
own
graceful
words
of
welcome
to
cry
has
anything
happened
why
are
you
so
late
they
were
visibly
excited
and
did
not
wait
for
greetings
before
pouring
out
their
attempted
assassination
of
king
humbert
on
the
pincian
hill
that
under
martial
plot
discovered
to
assassinate
the
premier
and
other
leaders
in
control
the
two
asked
questions
which
no
one
answered
and
all
talked
at
but
sybert
marcia
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
silent
and
it
struck
her
that
his
face
had
a
haggard
look
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
in
her
direction
except
for
a
bare
nod
of
greeting
on
his
arrival
well
well
copley
broke
into
the
general
babel
it
s
a
terrible
business
you
should
see
the
excitement
in
rome
the
city
is
simply
demoralized
but
we
ll
give
you
the
particulars
later
let
us
get
into
something
cool
re
all
nearly
dead
has
it
been
hot
out
here
rome
has
been
a
foretaste
of
the
and
this
young
man
melville
added
laying
a
hand
on
sybert
s
arm
just
got
back
from
the
milan
riots
hadn
t
slept
any
to
speak
of
for
four
days
and
what
does
he
do
this
afternoon
but
sit
down
at
his
desk
determined
to
make
up
his
back
work
sunday
or
no
sunday
with
the
thermometer
where
it
pleases
your
husband
and
i
had
to
drag
him
off
by
main
poor
sybert
you
do
look
worn
out
not
slept
for
four
days
why
you
must
be
nearly
dead
you
may
go
to
bed
immediately
after
dinner
and
i
shall
not
have
you
called
till
monday
i
ve
been
sleeping
for
the
last
hours
copley
and
i
really
don
t
need
any
more
sleep
at
present
he
protested
laughingly
but
with
a
slight
air
of
embarrassment
it
was
a
peculiar
trait
of
sybert
s
that
he
never
liked
to
be
made
the
subject
of
conversation
which
was
possibly
the
reason
why
he
had
been
made
the
subject
of
so
many
conversations
this
reticence
when
speaking
of
himself
or
his
own
feelings
struck
the
beholder
as
somewhat
puzzling
it
had
always
puzzled
marcia
and
had
been
one
reason
why
she
had
been
so
persistent
in
her
desire
to
find
out
what
he
was
really
like
the
party
shortly
assembled
for
dinner
the
women
in
the
coolest
of
light
summer
gowns
the
men
in
white
linen
instead
of
evening
dress
they
went
into
the
without
affording
marcia
a
chance
to
catch
her
uncle
alone
the
meal
did
not
pass
off
very
gaily
assassinations
were
served
with
the
soup
bread
riots
with
the
fish
and
hypothetical
robberies
and
plots
with
the
further
courses
while
pietro
presided
with
a
sinister
obsequiousness
which
added
darkly
to
the
effect
in
vain
copley
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
into
pleasanter
channels
the
men
were
too
stirred
up
to
talk
of
anything
else
and
the
threatened
tragedy
of
the
day
was
rehearsed
in
all
its
bearings
the
assassin
had
dashed
out
from
the
crowd
that
lined
the
driveway
and
sprung
to
the
side
of
the
royal
carriage
before
any
of
the
bystanders
had
realized
what
was
happening
the
sitting
at
his
majesty
s
side
was
the
first
to
see
and
springing
to
his
feet
he
struck
the
man
fiercely
in
the
face
just
as
he
raised
his
arm
had
it
not
been
for
the
s
quick
action
the
man
would
have
plunged
his
stiletto
into
the
king
s
heart
copley
and
melville
shuddered
and
marcia
leaned
forward
listening
with
wide
eyes
right
on
the
pincio
mind
melville
in
his
excitement
thumped
the
table
until
the
glasses
rang
not
a
chance
of
the
fellow
s
getting
off
scarcely
a
chance
of
his
accomplishing
his
purpose
he
knew
he
would
be
taken
shouted
libertà
as
the
soldiers
grabbed
swear
it
beats
me
what
these
fellows
are
after
libertà
that
s
what
they
cried
when
they
put
the
house
of
savoy
on
the
throne
and
now
they
re
trying
to
pull
it
off
again
with
the
same
i
fear
the
seeds
of
revolution
are
sown
pretty
thick
in
italy
said
copley
where
aren
t
there
the
seeds
of
revolution
melville
groaned
central
africa
is
only
waiting
a
government
in
order
to
overturn
by
the
way
interpolated
copley
the
assassin
is
a
friend
of
sybert
a
friend
of
sybert
s
marcia
echoed
the
words
before
she
considered
their
form
sybert
caught
the
expression
and
smiled
slightly
not
a
very
dear
friend
miss
marcia
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
i
believe
on
the
day
that
you
discovered
how
did
that
happen
copley
asked
i
heard
him
talking
in
a
it
s
a
pity
you
didn
t
hand
him
over
said
melville
you
would
have
saved
the
police
considerable
trouble
it
seems
they
have
been
watching
him
for
some
i
wasn
t
handing
people
over
just
then
sybert
returned
dryly
however
i
don
t
see
that
the
police
need
complain
it
strikes
me
that
he
has
handed
himself
over
in
about
as
effectual
a
way
as
he
possibly
could
he
won
t
go
about
any
more
sticking
stilettos
into
kings
the
italians
are
an
excitable
lot
when
they
once
get
aroused
they
talk
more
than
is
when
it
comes
to
doing
they
usually
back
down
it
seems
however
that
this
fellow
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
after
all
it
was
in
a
way
rather
fine
of
him
you
a
pretty
poor
way
melville
frowned
oh
certainly
sybert
acquiesced
carelessly
umberto
s
a
gentleman
i
don
t
care
to
see
him
what
i
can
t
understand
reiterated
melville
is
the
fellow
s
point
of
view
no
matter
how
much
he
may
object
to
kings
he
must
know
that
he
can
never
rid
the
country
of
them
through
assassination
as
soon
as
one
king
is
out
of
the
way
another
stands
in
line
to
take
his
place
no
possible
good
could
come
to
the
man
through
humbert
s
death
and
he
must
have
known
that
he
had
not
one
chance
in
a
hundred
of
escaping
confess
his
motive
is
beyond
me
the
only
thing
that
explains
it
to
my
mind
is
that
the
fellow
s
crazy
but
the
police
seem
to
think
he
s
entirely
sybert
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
studied
the
flowers
in
the
centre
of
the
table
with
a
speculative
frown
no
he
said
slowly
the
man
was
not
crazy
i
understand
his
motive
though
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
make
it
clear
it
was
probably
in
part
mistaken
not
entirely
that
i
heard
him
state
it
very
clearly
and
it
struck
me
at
the
time
that
it
was
doubtless
at
bottom
the
motive
for
most
assassinations
his
words
as
i
remember
them
were
something
like
this
who
is
the
king
he
is
only
a
man
why
is
he
so
different
from
me
am
i
not
a
man
too
i
am
and
before
i
die
the
king
shall
know
sybert
raised
his
eyes
and
glanced
about
the
table
copley
nodded
and
melville
frowned
thoughtfully
the
two
elder
ladies
were
listening
with
polite
attention
and
marcia
was
leaning
forward
with
her
eyes
on
his
face
sybert
immediately
dropped
his
own
eyes
to
the
flowers
again
there
you
have
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
why
did
he
wish
to
assassinate
the
king
as
an
expression
of
his
own
identity
through
a
perfectly
natural
egotistical
impulse
for
the
man
had
been
oppressed
and
trampled
on
all
his
life
he
was
conscious
of
powers
that
were
undeveloped
of
force
that
he
could
not
use
he
was
raging
blindly
against
the
weight
that
was
crushing
him
down
the
weight
was
society
but
its
outward
symbol
was
the
king
the
king
had
only
one
life
to
lose
and
this
despised
obscure
neapolitan
peasant
the
very
lowest
of
the
king
s
subjects
had
it
in
his
power
to
take
that
life
away
it
was
the
man
s
one
chance
of
one
chance
of
becoming
an
individual
of
leaving
his
mark
on
the
age
and
in
acting
as
he
did
he
acted
not
for
himself
alone
but
for
the
people
for
the
inarticulate
thousands
who
are
struggling
for
some
mode
of
expression
but
are
bound
by
cowardice
and
ignorance
and
sybert
paused
and
raised
his
eyes
to
melville
s
with
a
sort
of
challenge
if
that
man
had
been
able
to
obtain
congenial
in
which
he
could
take
an
interest
could
express
his
own
identity
if
he
could
have
become
a
little
prosperous
so
that
he
need
not
fear
for
his
family
s
support
why
king
s
life
would
not
have
been
in
danger
and
as
long
as
there
is
any
man
left
in
this
kingdom
of
italy
he
added
who
in
spite
of
honest
endeavour
can
not
earn
enough
to
support
his
family
just
so
long
is
the
king
s
life
in
and
there
are
thousands
of
such
men
put
in
copley
melville
uttered
a
short
laugh
by
heavens
it
s
true
he
said
the
position
of
american
consul
may
not
carry
much
glory
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
care
to
trade
it
with
umberto
for
his
do
you
suppose
the
king
was
scared
inquired
marcia
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
to
wake
up
every
morning
and
think
that
maybe
before
night
you
ll
be
he
didn
t
appear
to
be
scared
said
her
uncle
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
they
caught
the
man
and
remarked
that
this
was
one
of
the
perquisites
of
his
really
she
asked
good
for
umberto
oh
he
s
no
coward
said
sybert
he
knows
the
price
of
crowns
these
it
s
terrible
melville
breathed
i
am
thankful
they
caught
the
assassin
at
least
society
ought
to
sleep
better
for
having
him
ah
said
sybert
society
can
t
be
protected
that
way
the
point
is
that
he
leaves
others
behind
to
do
his
the
man
was
from
naples
you
say
copley
asked
suddenly
her
husband
read
her
thoughts
and
smiled
reassuringly
so
far
as
i
have
heard
my
dear
there
was
no
crucifix
tattooed
upon
his
marcia
raised
her
head
quickly
uncle
howard
she
asked
is
that
the
mark
of
a
society
or
of
just
that
special
man
i
can
t
say
i
m
sure
marcia
he
returned
with
a
laugh
i
suspect
that
it
s
an
original
piece
of
blasphemy
on
his
part
though
it
may
belong
to
a
when
is
his
time
up
she
persisted
to
get
out
of
prison
i
i
don
t
know
i
really
haven
t
figured
it
up
there
are
enough
things
to
worry
about
without
troubling
over
in
her
excitement
over
the
king
s
attempted
assassination
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
man
of
the
grotto
but
her
uncle
s
careless
laugh
brought
back
her
terror
the
man
might
at
that
very
moment
be
watching
them
from
the
ilex
grove
she
cast
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
open
glass
doors
which
led
to
the
balcony
it
was
moonlight
again
in
contrast
to
the
soft
radiance
of
the
terrace
the
ilex
shadows
were
black
with
the
sinister
blackness
of
a
pall
she
looked
down
at
her
plate
with
a
little
shiver
and
she
sat
through
the
rest
of
the
meal
in
an
agony
of
impatience
to
get
up
and
move
about
once
she
roused
herself
to
listen
to
the
conversation
they
were
talking
of
the
soldiers
a
large
detachment
of
carabinieri
had
been
stationed
at
palestrina
and
the
mountain
roads
were
being
patrolled
the
carriage
that
night
had
passed
two
men
on
horseback
stationed
at
the
turning
where
the
road
to
castel
vivalanti
branches
off
from
the
via
prænestina
copley
said
something
about
its
giving
them
a
feeling
of
security
at
the
villa
to
have
so
many
soldiers
near
and
melville
replied
that
whatever
the
crimes
of
the
italian
government
it
at
least
looked
after
the
safety
of
its
guests
marcia
listened
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
she
rose
from
the
table
with
an
almost
easy
mind
they
all
adjourned
to
the
salon
for
coffee
and
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
to
her
uncle
without
attracting
attention
she
touched
him
on
the
arm
come
out
on
the
loggia
just
a
moment
uncle
howard
i
want
to
tell
you
he
followed
her
in
some
surprise
she
went
down
the
steps
and
paused
on
the
terrace
well
out
of
of
the
salon
windows
uncle
howard
i
saw
the
tattooed
man
copley
paused
with
a
match
in
one
hand
and
a
cigar
in
the
other
whereabouts
he
asked
asleep
in
the
ruined
are
you
sure
there
was
a
crucifix
tattooed
upside
down
on
his
so
he
examined
the
pavement
in
silence
a
moment
then
he
raised
his
head
with
an
excited
little
laugh
such
as
a
hunter
might
give
when
hot
on
the
scent
well
i
thought
i
had
done
for
him
but
it
appears
he
strode
over
to
the
salon
windows
sybert
he
called
in
a
low
tone
just
step
out
here
a
sybert
joined
them
with
a
questioning
look
copley
very
deliberately
scratched
his
match
on
the
balustrade
and
lighted
his
cigar
tell
your
story
marcia
he
said
between
puffs
she
felt
a
load
of
anxiety
roll
from
her
shoulders
if
he
could
take
the
information
as
casually
as
this
it
could
not
be
very
serious
she
repeated
the
account
of
what
she
had
seen
and
the
two
men
exchanged
a
silent
glance
copley
gave
another
short
laugh
it
appears
that
his
majesty
and
i
are
in
the
same
i
warned
you
that
if
you
let
that
wheat
be
sold
in
your
name
you
could
expect
the
honour
sybert
growled
what
do
you
mean
marcia
asked
quickly
just
at
present
miss
marcia
i
m
afraid
that
neither
your
uncle
nor
myself
is
as
popular
as
our
virtues
oh
there
s
no
danger
said
copley
they
wouldn
t
dare
break
into
the
house
and
of
course
i
sha
n
t
be
fool
enough
to
walk
the
unarmed
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
shall
send
into
palestrina
for
some
carabinieri
to
patrol
the
place
and
on
monday
the
family
can
move
into
rome
instead
of
waiting
till
wednesday
there
s
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
added
with
a
reassuring
glance
at
marcia
forewarned
is
ll
see
that
the
house
is
locked
can
you
trust
the
servants
sybert
asked
copley
looked
up
quickly
as
a
thought
struck
him
by
jove
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
come
to
think
of
it
i
shouldn
t
trust
that
pietro
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
he
s
been
acting
mighty
queer
marcia
s
eyes
suddenly
widened
in
terror
and
she
recalled
one
afternoon
when
she
had
caught
pietro
in
the
village
talking
to
gervasio
s
stepfather
as
well
as
a
dozen
other
little
things
that
she
had
not
thought
of
at
the
time
but
which
now
seemed
to
have
a
secret
meaning
sybert
saw
her
look
of
fear
and
he
said
lightly
there
s
not
the
slightest
danger
miss
marcia
we
ll
get
the
soldiers
here
in
the
morning
and
for
even
if
we
can
t
put
much
trust
in
the
butler
there
are
at
least
three
men
in
the
house
who
are
above
suspicion
and
who
are
he
touched
his
pocket
with
a
laugh
when
it
comes
to
the
point
i
am
a
very
fair
shot
and
so
is
your
uncle
you
were
wishing
a
little
while
ago
that
something
exciting
would
it
gives
you
any
pleasure
you
can
pretend
that
this
is
an
oh
yes
marcia
her
uncle
rejoined
don
t
let
the
thought
of
the
tattooed
man
disturb
your
sleep
he
s
more
spectacular
than
the
others
had
come
out
on
to
the
loggia
and
were
exclaiming
at
the
beauty
of
the
night
howard
copley
called
don
t
you
want
to
come
and
make
a
fourth
at
whist
in
a
moment
he
returned
we
won
t
say
anything
to
the
others
he
said
in
a
low
tone
to
marcia
and
sybert
there
s
no
use
raising
any
unnecessary
marcia
if
you
and
sybert
would
like
to
play
we
can
make
it
euchre
instead
of
sybert
glanced
down
to
see
that
her
hand
was
trembling
and
he
decided
that
to
make
her
sit
through
a
game
of
cards
would
be
too
great
a
test
of
her
nerves
thank
you
copley
he
called
back
it
s
too
fine
a
night
to
pass
indoors
miss
marcia
and
i
will
stay
out
the
proposal
was
a
test
of
his
own
nerves
but
he
had
schooled
himself
for
a
good
many
years
to
hide
his
feelings
it
was
an
ordeal
he
was
used
to
with
final
exclamations
on
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
whist
party
returned
to
the
salon
sybert
brought
a
wicker
chair
from
the
loggia
for
marcia
and
seated
himself
on
the
parapet
while
he
lighted
a
cigar
with
a
nonchalance
she
could
not
help
but
admire
did
she
but
know
it
his
nonchalance
was
only
surface
deep
though
the
cause
for
his
inward
tumult
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
man
of
the
ruined
grotto
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
time
looking
down
on
the
shimmering
campagna
the
scene
was
as
beautiful
as
on
that
other
night
of
the
early
spring
but
now
it
was
full
summer
it
was
so
peaceful
so
idyllic
so
thoroughly
the
italy
of
poetry
and
romance
that
it
seemed
absurd
to
think
of
plots
and
riots
in
connexion
with
that
landscape
at
least
marcia
was
not
thinking
of
them
now
she
was
willing
to
take
her
uncle
at
his
word
and
leave
the
responsibility
to
him
the
thing
that
was
still
burning
in
her
mind
was
that
unexplained
moment
by
the
fountain
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
alone
with
sybert
since
how
would
he
act
would
he
simply
ignore
it
as
if
it
had
never
happened
he
would
of
course
and
that
would
be
far
worse
than
if
he
apologized
or
congratulated
her
for
then
she
would
have
a
chance
to
explain
what
did
he
think
she
asked
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
as
she
covertly
scanned
his
dark
impassive
face
did
he
think
her
engaged
to
paul
dessart
or
did
he
divine
the
real
reason
why
the
young
man
had
so
suddenly
sailed
for
america
even
so
it
would
not
put
her
in
a
much
better
light
in
his
eyes
he
would
think
she
had
been
playing
with
paul
face
flushed
at
the
tried
to
play
with
him
sybert
was
the
one
who
broke
the
silence
i
think
he
said
slowly
that
i
could
spot
your
man
with
the
crucifix
this
very
he
pointed
with
his
cigar
toward
the
hill
above
them
where
little
castel
vivalanti
was
outlined
against
the
sky
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
is
in
the
back
room
of
a
up
there
in
company
with
our
friend
tarquinio
of
the
who
he
added
meditatively
is
a
fool
those
carabinieri
are
not
guarding
the
roads
for
nothing
a
number
of
neapolitans
have
come
north
lately
who
might
better
have
stayed
at
for
the
most
the
government
is
after
them
this
fellow
with
the
crucifix
is
without
doubt
one
of
them
and
in
all
probability
he
just
happened
into
the
ruins
this
afternoon
to
rest
without
having
an
idea
who
lived
here
at
any
rate
i
strongly
suspect
that
your
uncle
it
not
the
hare
he
s
hunting
italy
is
too
busy
just
at
present
to
take
time
for
private
he
smiled
i
have
no
wish
to
spoil
your
marcia
breathed
a
little
sigh
by
way
of
answer
and
another
silence
fell
between
them
on
such
a
night
as
this
he
said
dreamily
did
you
and
i
miss
marcia
once
take
a
drive
and
we
didn
t
speak
a
word
i
don
t
know
that
we
did
he
laughed
at
least
i
don
t
recall
the
from
the
valley
below
them
there
came
the
sound
of
a
man
s
voice
singing
a
familiar
serenade
only
the
tune
was
audible
but
the
words
they
knew
open
your
casement
love
i
come
as
a
robber
to
steal
your
sybert
listening
watched
her
from
under
drooping
lids
he
was
struggling
with
a
sudden
temptation
which
almost
overmastered
him
he
thought
her
engaged
to
another
man
not
come
as
a
robber
and
steal
her
heart
in
the
past
few
weeks
he
had
seen
lifelong
hopes
come
to
nothing
he
was
wounded
and
discouraged
and
in
need
of
human
sympathy
and
he
had
fought
his
battles
alone
during
that
time
of
struggle
marcia
had
come
to
occupy
a
large
part
of
his
consciousness
he
had
seen
in
her
character
undeveloped
promise
for
the
the
desire
had
subtly
taken
hold
of
him
to
be
the
one
to
watch
and
direct
her
growth
the
new
feeling
was
the
more
intense
in
that
it
had
taken
the
place
of
hopes
and
interests
that
were
dying
and
then
that
too
had
been
snatched
away
since
the
night
of
her
birthday
ball
he
had
not
doubted
for
a
moment
that
she
was
engaged
to
paul
dessart
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
scene
he
had
interrupted
was
merely
her
sympathetic
fashion
of
dismissing
the
young
man
a
dozen
little
things
had
come
back
to
him
that
before
had
had
no
significance
and
he
had
accepted
the
fact
without
questioning
it
seemed
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
his
fate
that
this
should
be
added
just
when
it
was
hardest
for
him
to
bear
it
was
the
final
touch
of
nemesis
that
made
her
work
rounded
and
complete
and
now
as
he
watched
her
he
was
filled
with
a
sudden
fierce
rebellion
an
impulse
to
fight
against
the
fate
that
was
robbing
him
to
snatch
her
away
from
paul
dessart
every
instinct
of
his
nature
urged
him
forward
only
honour
held
him
back
he
turned
away
and
with
troubled
eyes
studied
the
distance
she
had
chosen
wisely
or
not
the
future
would
prove
he
knew
that
he
could
not
honourably
stretch
out
so
much
as
his
little
finger
to
call
her
back
presently
he
pulled
himself
together
and
began
to
talk
fluently
and
easily
on
purely
impersonal
the
superiority
of
the
tyrol
over
the
swiss
lakes
as
a
summer
resort
of
the
character
of
the
people
in
sicily
of
books
and
art
and
european
politics
and
of
a
dozen
different
subjects
that
marcia
had
never
heard
him
mention
before
it
was
the
small
talk
of
the
diplomat
of
the
man
who
must
always
be
ready
to
meet
every
one
on
his
own
ground
marcia
had
known
that
sybert
could
talk
on
other
subjects
than
italian
politics
when
he
chose
for
she
had
overheard
him
at
dinners
and
receptions
but
he
had
never
chosen
when
with
her
in
their
early
intercourse
he
had
scarcely
taken
the
trouble
to
talk
to
her
in
any
but
the
most
perfunctory
way
and
then
suddenly
their
relations
had
no
longer
demanded
formal
conversation
they
had
somehow
jumped
over
the
preliminary
period
of
getting
acquainted
and
had
reached
the
stage
where
they
could
understand
each
other
without
talking
and
here
he
was
conversing
with
her
as
politely
and
impersonally
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
only
half
an
hour
she
kept
up
her
end
of
the
conversation
with
monosyllables
she
felt
chilled
and
hurt
he
might
at
least
be
frank
whatever
he
thought
of
her
there
was
no
need
for
this
elaborate
dissimulation
she
had
no
need
to
ask
herself
if
he
were
watching
her
his
eyes
never
for
a
moment
left
the
moonlit
campagna
after
half
an
hour
or
so
copley
stepped
to
the
window
of
the
salon
to
ask
marcia
if
she
did
not
wish
a
wrap
it
was
warm
of
course
but
the
evening
dews
were
heavy
marcia
scoffed
at
the
absurdity
of
a
wrap
on
such
an
evening
but
she
rose
obediently
they
strolled
into
the
house
and
paused
at
the
door
of
the
salon
the
were
studying
their
cards
again
with
anxious
brows
it
appeared
to
be
a
scientific
game
marcia
shook
her
head
and
laughed
on
such
a
night
as
this
to
be
playing
whist
melville
glanced
up
at
her
with
a
little
smile
ah
well
miss
marcia
we
re
growing
and
romance
were
made
for
the
sybert
smiled
rather
coldly
as
he
turned
away
it
struck
him
that
the
remark
was
singularly
malapropos
marcia
went
on
up
to
her
room
and
throwing
about
her
shoulders
a
chiffon
scarf
an
absurd
apology
for
a
wrap
she
paused
a
moment
by
the
open
glass
doors
of
the
balcony
and
stood
looking
down
upon
the
moonlit
landscape
she
felt
sore
and
bruised
and
hopeless
sybert
was
beyond
her
she
did
not
understand
him
he
had
evidently
made
up
his
mind
and
nothing
would
move
him
he
would
give
her
no
chance
to
put
herself
right
she
suddenly
threw
back
her
head
and
stiffened
her
shoulders
if
that
were
the
line
he
chose
to
well
she
would
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
she
turned
back
and
on
her
way
downstairs
paused
a
second
at
gerald
s
door
it
was
a
family
habit
to
look
in
on
him
at
all
hours
of
the
night
to
make
sure
that
he
was
sleeping
and
duly
covered
up
though
it
could
scarcely
be
claimed
that
cover
was
necessary
she
glanced
in
and
then
with
a
quickening
of
her
breath
took
a
step
farther
to
make
sure
the
bed
was
empty
she
stood
staring
a
moment
not
knowing
what
to
think
and
the
next
she
was
hurrying
down
the
hall
toward
the
servants
quarters
she
knocked
on
bianca
s
door
and
finding
no
one
within
called
up
granton
there
was
no
cause
for
worry
granton
assured
her
master
gerald
and
that
little
italian
brat
were
probably
in
the
scullery
stealing
raisins
and
chocolate
oh
said
marcia
with
a
sigh
of
relief
but
where
s
bianca
she
ought
to
sit
by
gerald
till
he
goes
to
sleep
bianca
sniffed
one
could
make
head
or
tail
of
bianca
her
opinion
was
that
the
girl
was
half
crazy
she
had
been
in
there
that
night
crying
and
telling
her
how
much
she
liked
the
signora
and
the
signorina
and
how
she
hated
to
leave
them
but
she
isn
t
going
to
leave
said
marcia
we
ve
decided
to
take
her
with
granton
responded
with
a
disdainful
english
shrug
and
the
reiterated
opinion
that
the
girl
was
crazy
marcia
did
not
stop
to
argue
the
point
but
set
out
for
the
kitchen
by
way
of
the
middle
staircase
creeping
along
quietly
determined
to
catch
the
marauders
unawares
her
caution
was
superfluous
the
rear
of
the
house
was
entirely
deserted
no
sign
of
a
boy
no
sign
of
a
servant
anywhere
about
the
doors
were
open
and
the
rooms
were
vacant
she
hurried
upstairs
again
in
growing
mystification
and
turned
toward
gervasio
s
room
the
little
fellow
was
in
bed
and
sound
asleep
what
did
it
mean
she
asked
herself
what
could
have
become
of
gerald
and
where
had
all
the
servants
gone
suddenly
a
horrible
suspicion
flashed
over
her
gervasio
s
he
have
stolen
gerald
by
way
of
revenge
that
was
why
bianca
was
crying
it
was
a
plot
she
had
overheard
and
they
had
threatened
to
kill
her
if
she
told
perhaps
they
would
hold
him
for
a
ransom
the
sound
of
her
uncle
s
careless
laugh
floated
up
from
below
she
caught
her
breath
in
a
convulsive
sob
and
stretched
out
her
hand
against
the
wall
to
steady
herself
chapter
xxiv
collecting
herself
sufficiently
to
know
that
she
must
not
cry
out
or
alarm
her
aunt
marcia
hurried
to
the
front
staircase
and
stood
a
moment
on
the
landing
hesitating
what
to
do
sybert
was
lounging
in
the
doorway
leading
on
to
the
loggia
she
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
called
to
him
softly
so
as
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
others
he
turned
with
a
start
at
the
sound
of
his
name
and
in
response
to
her
summons
crossed
the
hall
in
his
usual
leisurely
stroll
but
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
face
in
the
dim
he
came
springing
up
three
steps
at
a
time
what
s
the
matter
what
s
happened
he
cried
gerald
marcia
breathed
in
a
sobbing
whisper
gerald
he
repeated
anxious
lines
showing
in
his
face
good
heavens
marcia
what
s
happened
i
don
t
know
he
s
gone
she
said
wildly
come
up
here
where
aunt
katherine
won
t
hear
she
led
the
way
up
into
the
hall
again
and
explained
in
broken
sentences
sybert
turned
without
a
word
and
strode
back
to
gerald
s
room
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
looking
at
the
empty
little
crib
and
tossed
pillows
it
will
simply
kill
uncle
howard
and
aunt
katherina
if
anything
has
happened
to
him
marcia
faltered
nothing
has
happened
to
him
sybert
returned
shortly
the
scoundrels
wouldn
t
dare
steal
a
child
every
police
spy
in
italy
would
be
after
them
he
must
be
with
bianca
he
turned
away
from
the
room
and
went
on
down
the
stone
passage
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
he
paused
at
the
head
of
the
middle
staircase
thinking
the
matter
over
with
frowning
brows
while
marcia
anxiously
studied
his
face
as
they
stood
there
in
the
dim
moonlight
that
streamed
in
through
the
small
square
window
over
the
stairs
they
suddenly
heard
the
patter
of
bare
feet
in
the
passage
below
and
in
another
moment
gerald
himself
came
scurrying
up
the
winding
stone
stairway
looking
like
a
little
white
rat
in
the
dimness
marcia
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
sybert
squared
his
shoulders
as
if
a
weight
had
dropped
from
them
their
second
glance
at
the
child
s
face
however
told
them
that
something
had
happened
his
little
white
nightgown
was
draggled
with
dew
his
face
was
twitching
nervously
and
his
eyes
were
wild
with
terror
he
reached
the
top
step
and
plunged
into
marcia
s
arms
with
a
burst
of
sobbing
gerald
gerald
what
s
the
matter
don
t
make
such
a
noise
hush
dear
you
will
frighten
mamma
marcia
won
t
let
anything
hurt
you
tell
me
what
s
the
gerald
clung
to
her
crying
and
trembling
and
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
unintelligible
italian
sybert
bent
down
and
taking
him
in
his
arms
carried
him
back
to
his
own
room
no
one
s
going
to
hurt
you
stop
crying
and
tell
us
what
s
the
matter
he
said
peremptorily
gerald
caught
his
breath
and
told
his
story
in
a
mixture
of
english
and
italian
and
sobs
it
had
been
so
hot
and
the
nightingales
had
made
such
a
noise
that
he
couldn
t
go
to
sleep
and
he
had
got
up
very
softly
so
as
not
to
disturb
mamma
and
had
crept
out
the
back
way
just
to
get
some
cherries
a
group
of
scrub
trees
cherry
almond
and
pomegranate
grew
close
to
the
villa
walls
in
the
rear
while
he
was
sitting
under
the
tree
eating
cherries
some
men
came
up
and
stopped
in
the
bushes
close
by
and
he
could
hear
what
they
said
and
one
of
them
was
pietro
here
he
began
to
cry
again
and
the
soothing
had
to
be
done
over
well
what
did
they
say
tell
us
what
they
said
gerald
sybert
broke
in
in
his
low
insistent
tones
vey
said
my
papa
was
a
bad
man
an
vey
was
going
to
kill
him
cause
he
had
veir
money
in
his
i
don
t
want
my
papa
killed
he
wailed
marcia
s
eyes
met
sybert
s
in
silence
and
he
emitted
a
low
breath
that
was
half
a
whistle
what
else
did
they
say
gerald
you
needn
t
be
afraid
we
won
t
let
them
hurt
your
papa
but
you
must
remember
everything
they
said
so
that
we
can
catch
pietro
said
he
was
going
to
kill
you
too
cause
you
was
here
an
was
bad
like
papa
gerald
sobbed
go
on
sybert
urged
what
else
did
they
say
vey
didn
t
say
nuffin
more
but
went
away
in
ve
grove
an
i
was
scared
an
kept
still
an
it
was
all
under
ve
trees
an
ven
i
cwept
in
an
i
found
i
don
t
want
you
killed
an
i
don
t
want
papa
don
t
be
afraid
we
won
t
let
them
hurt
us
and
now
try
to
remember
how
many
men
there
pietro
an
uvers
an
vey
went
away
in
ve
they
questioned
him
some
more
but
got
merely
a
variation
of
the
same
story
it
was
evidently
all
he
knew
marcia
called
granton
to
sit
with
him
and
tremulously
explained
the
situation
granton
received
the
information
calmly
it
was
all
she
had
ever
expected
in
italy
she
said
out
in
the
hall
again
marcia
looked
at
sybert
questioningly
she
was
quite
composed
gerald
was
safe
at
least
and
they
knew
what
was
coming
she
felt
that
her
uncle
and
sybert
would
bring
things
right
what
shall
we
do
she
asked
sybert
with
folded
arms
was
considering
the
question
it
s
evidently
a
mixture
of
robbery
and
revenge
and
mistaken
patriotism
all
rolled
into
one
it
would
be
convenient
if
we
knew
how
many
there
were
pietro
and
gervasio
s
stepfather
and
your
man
with
the
crucifix
we
may
safely
count
upon
but
just
how
many
more
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
however
there
s
no
danger
of
their
beginning
operations
till
they
think
we
re
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
a
quarter
to
ten
we
have
a
good
two
hours
still
and
we
ll
prepare
to
surprise
them
we
won
t
tell
the
people
downstairs
just
yet
for
it
won
t
do
any
good
and
their
talk
and
laughter
are
the
best
protection
we
could
have
you
don
t
know
where
your
uncle
keeps
his
revolver
do
you
yes
in
the
top
drawer
of
his
she
stepped
into
copley
s
room
and
pulled
open
the
drawer
why
it
s
gone
i
say
the
plot
thickens
and
sybert
too
uttered
a
short
low
laugh
as
copley
had
done
on
the
terrace
and
the
rifle
s
gone
marcia
added
her
glance
wandering
to
the
corner
where
the
usually
stood
it
s
evident
that
our
friend
pietro
has
been
helping
himself
but
if
he
thinks
he
s
going
to
shoot
us
with
our
own
arms
he
s
mistaken
we
must
get
word
to
the
soldiers
at
you
tell
me
the
servants
were
gone
i
couldn
t
find
any
one
but
granton
the
whole
house
is
it
s
the
camorra
he
exclaimed
softly
the
camorra
marcia
paled
a
trifle
at
the
name
s
plain
enough
we
should
have
suspected
it
before
pietro
is
a
member
and
has
been
acting
as
a
spy
from
the
inside
it
appears
to
be
a
very
prettily
worked
out
plot
they
have
waited
until
they
think
there
s
money
in
the
house
your
uncle
has
just
sold
a
big
consignment
of
wheat
they
have
probably
dismissed
the
servants
with
their
usual
formula
be
silent
and
you
live
speak
and
you
the
servants
would
be
more
afraid
of
the
camorra
than
of
the
about
the
stablemen
oh
i
can
t
believe
they
d
join
a
plot
against
us
marcia
cried
angelo
and
giovanni
i
would
trust
in
that
case
they
ve
been
silenced
they
are
where
they
won
t
give
testimony
until
it
is
too
late
i
dare
say
the
fellows
are
even
planning
to
ride
off
on
the
horses
themselves
by
morning
they
would
be
well
into
the
mountains
of
the
abruzzi
where
the
camorrists
are
at
home
we
ll
have
to
get
help
from
palestrina
if
we
could
reach
those
guards
at
the
they
would
ride
in
with
the
message
it
s
only
two
miles
away
he
frowned
a
trifle
i
suppose
the
house
is
closely
watched
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
get
out
unseen
we
ll
have
to
try
it
whom
can
we
send
he
was
silent
a
moment
i
don
t
like
to
leave
you
he
said
slowly
but
i
m
afraid
i
ll
have
to
oh
said
marcia
with
a
little
gasp
she
stood
looking
down
at
the
floor
with
troubled
eyes
and
sybert
watched
her
careless
that
the
time
was
passing
marcia
suddenly
raised
her
eyes
with
an
exclamation
of
relief
gervasio
she
cried
we
can
send
could
we
trust
him
he
doubted
anywhere
and
he
can
get
away
without
being
seen
easier
than
you
could
i
am
sure
he
can
do
it
he
is
very
i
d
forgotten
him
yes
i
believe
that
is
the
best
way
you
go
and
wake
him
and
i
ll
write
a
note
to
the
sybert
turned
to
the
as
he
spoke
and
marcia
hurried
back
to
gervasio
s
room
the
boy
was
asleep
with
the
moonlight
streaming
across
his
pillow
she
bent
over
him
hesitatingly
while
her
heart
reproached
her
at
having
to
wake
him
and
send
him
out
on
such
an
errand
but
the
next
moment
she
had
reflected
that
it
might
be
the
only
chance
for
him
as
well
as
for
the
rest
of
them
and
she
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
forehead
gervasio
she
whispered
wake
up
gervasio
dress
just
as
fast
as
you
can
no
you
haven
t
done
anything
don
t
be
frightened
signor
siberti
is
going
to
tell
you
a
she
repeated
impressively
put
on
these
clothes
she
added
hunting
out
a
dark
suit
from
his
wardrobe
and
never
mind
your
shoes
and
stockings
dress
and
then
come
on
signor
copley
s
gervasio
was
into
his
clothes
and
after
her
almost
before
she
had
got
back
when
undirected
by
bianca
his
dressing
was
a
simple
matter
sybert
drew
him
across
the
threshold
and
closed
the
door
what
shall
we
tell
him
he
questioned
marcia
tell
him
the
truth
he
can
understand
and
we
can
trust
and
dropping
on
her
knees
beside
the
boy
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
gervasio
she
said
in
her
slow
italian
some
bad
naughty
men
are
coming
here
to
try
to
kill
us
and
steal
our
things
pietro
is
one
of
them
pietro
had
that
very
afternoon
boxed
gervasio
s
ears
for
stealing
sugar
from
the
and
your
stepfather
is
one
and
he
will
take
you
back
to
castel
vivalanti
and
you
will
never
see
us
gervasio
listened
with
his
eyes
on
her
face
and
his
lips
parted
in
horror
sybert
here
broke
in
and
explained
about
the
soldiers
and
how
he
was
to
reach
the
guard
at
the
corners
and
he
ended
by
hiding
the
note
in
the
front
of
his
blouse
do
you
understand
he
asked
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
gervasio
nodded
his
eyes
now
shining
with
excitement
i
ll
bring
the
soldiers
he
whispered
signore
and
if
they
catch
me
he
added
i
ll
say
the
has
whipped
me
and
i
m
running
you
ll
do
sybert
said
with
a
and
taking
the
boy
by
the
hand
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
middle
staircase
and
the
three
crept
down
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
they
traversed
on
tiptoe
the
long
brick
passageway
that
led
to
the
kitchen
and
paused
upon
the
threshold
the
great
room
was
empty
and
quiet
and
echoing
as
on
the
first
day
they
had
come
to
the
villa
the
doors
and
windows
were
swinging
wide
and
the
moonlight
was
streaming
in
sybert
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
frown
what
i
can
t
make
out
he
said
in
a
low
tone
is
why
they
should
leave
everything
so
open
they
must
have
known
that
we
would
find
out
before
we
went
to
bed
that
the
servants
were
missing
who
usually
locks
up
you
and
i
will
lock
up
he
considered
a
moment
we
mustn
t
let
him
out
within
sight
of
the
grove
a
window
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
house
would
be
best
where
the
shrubbery
grows
close
to
the
marcia
led
the
way
into
a
little
opening
from
the
kitchen
and
sybert
gave
gervasio
his
last
directions
keep
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
across
the
driveway
and
down
around
the
lower
terrace
creep
on
your
hands
and
knees
through
the
wheat
field
and
then
strike
straight
for
the
and
run
every
step
of
the
way
gervasio
nodded
and
marcia
bent
and
kissed
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
if
you
bring
the
soldiers
gervasio
you
may
live
with
us
always
and
be
our
little
boy
just
like
he
nodded
again
fairly
trembling
with
anxiety
to
get
started
sybert
carefully
swung
the
window
open
and
the
little
fellow
dropped
to
the
ground
and
crept
like
a
cat
into
the
shadows
they
stood
by
the
open
window
for
several
minutes
straining
their
ears
to
listen
but
no
sound
came
back
except
the
peaceful
music
of
a
summer
murmur
of
insects
and
the
songs
of
nightingales
gervasio
had
got
off
safely
now
we
ll
lock
the
house
sybert
added
in
an
undertone
so
that
when
our
friends
come
to
call
they
will
have
to
come
the
front
he
closed
the
window
softly
and
examined
with
approval
the
inside
shutters
they
were
made
of
solid
wood
with
heavy
iron
bolts
and
hinges
the
villa
had
been
planned
in
the
old
days
before
the
police
force
was
as
efficient
as
now
and
it
was
quite
prepared
to
stand
a
siege
it
will
take
considerable
strength
to
open
these
and
some
noise
he
remarked
as
he
swung
the
shutters
to
and
shot
the
bolts
they
groped
their
way
out
and
went
from
room
to
room
closing
and
bolting
the
windows
and
doors
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
sybert
appeared
to
marcia
s
astonished
senses
to
be
in
an
unusually
frame
of
mind
once
or
twice
he
laughed
softly
and
once
when
her
hand
touched
his
in
the
dark
she
felt
that
same
warm
thrill
run
through
her
as
on
that
other
moonlight
night
they
came
last
to
the
big
vaulted
which
had
served
as
chapel
in
the
devotional
days
of
the
vivalanti
the
three
glass
doors
at
the
end
were
open
to
the
moonlight
which
flooded
the
apartment
softening
the
crude
outlines
of
the
frescoes
on
the
ceiling
to
the
beauty
of
old
masters
sybert
paused
with
his
back
to
the
doors
to
look
up
and
down
approvingly
do
you
know
it
isn
t
half
bad
in
this
light
he
remarked
casually
to
marcia
that
old
fellow
up
there
he
nodded
toward
bacchus
reclining
among
the
vines
in
the
central
panelling
might
be
a
michelangelo
in
the
moonlight
and
in
the
sunlight
he
isn
t
even
a
carlo
marcia
stared
what
could
he
be
thinking
of
to
choose
this
time
of
all
others
to
be
making
art
criticisms
never
had
she
heard
him
express
the
slightest
interest
in
the
subject
before
she
had
been
under
so
great
a
strain
for
so
long
such
a
succession
of
shocks
that
she
was
nearly
at
the
end
of
her
and
then
to
have
sybert
acting
in
this
unprecedented
way
she
looked
past
him
out
of
the
door
toward
the
black
shadow
of
the
ilexes
and
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
what
they
might
conceal
the
next
moment
sybert
had
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
mr
sybert
she
cried
aghast
they
may
be
watching
us
come
he
laughed
and
seated
himself
sidewise
on
the
iron
railing
if
they
re
watching
us
they
re
doubtless
wondering
why
we
re
closing
the
house
so
carefully
we
ll
stop
here
a
few
minutes
and
let
them
see
we
re
unsuspicious
that
we
re
just
shutting
the
doors
for
fear
of
draughts
and
not
of
they
ll
shoot
you
she
gasped
her
eyes
upon
his
white
suit
which
made
a
shining
target
in
the
moonlight
nonsense
miss
marcia
they
couldn
t
hit
me
if
they
he
marked
the
distance
to
the
grove
with
a
calculating
eye
there
s
no
danger
of
their
trying
however
they
won
t
risk
giving
their
plot
away
just
for
the
sake
of
nabbing
me
i
m
not
king
humbert
they
don
t
hate
me
as
much
as
he
leaned
forward
with
another
laugh
come
out
and
talk
to
me
miss
marcia
let
me
see
how
brave
you
marcia
flattened
herself
against
the
wall
i
m
not
brave
please
come
back
sybert
we
must
tell
uncle
if
marcia
did
not
know
sybert
he
did
not
know
himself
he
was
under
a
greater
strain
than
she
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
not
see
her
again
and
he
had
weakly
come
he
had
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
talk
to
her
that
he
would
not
by
the
slightest
sign
betray
his
feelings
and
he
found
himself
thrown
with
her
under
the
most
intimate
conditions
they
shared
a
secret
they
were
in
danger
together
it
was
within
the
realms
of
possibility
that
he
would
be
killed
the
camorrists
had
attempted
it
before
they
might
succeed
this
time
he
actually
did
not
care
he
almost
welcomed
the
notion
ambition
was
dead
within
him
he
had
nothing
to
live
for
and
he
was
reckless
he
thought
that
marcia
was
in
love
with
another
man
but
he
dimly
divined
his
own
influence
over
her
once
at
least
he
told
before
she
went
back
to
the
boy
she
had
chosen
she
should
acknowledge
his
power
she
should
bend
her
will
to
his
he
knew
that
she
was
frightened
but
she
should
conquer
her
fear
she
should
come
out
into
the
moonlight
and
stand
beside
him
hand
in
hand
facing
the
shadows
of
the
ilex
grove
he
bent
forward
watching
her
as
she
stood
in
her
white
evening
gown
outlined
against
the
dark
tapestry
of
the
wall
her
face
surrounded
by
glowing
hair
her
grey
eyes
big
with
amazement
and
fear
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
her
marcia
he
called
in
a
low
insistent
tone
come
here
marcia
come
out
here
and
stand
beside
me
or
i
shall
think
you
are
a
she
turned
aside
with
a
little
shuddering
gasp
and
hid
her
head
against
the
wall
what
if
they
should
shoot
him
in
the
back
as
he
sat
there
sybert
suddenly
came
to
himself
and
sprang
forward
with
an
apology
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
marcia
i
didn
t
mean
to
frighten
you
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
he
began
closing
the
doors
and
shutters
farthest
away
as
he
reached
her
side
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
her
eyes
were
shut
and
she
did
not
move
he
closed
and
barred
the
last
shutter
and
they
stood
silent
in
the
dark
marcia
was
struggling
to
control
herself
i
shall
think
you
a
coward
was
ringing
in
her
ears
she
had
borne
a
great
deal
from
the
moment
when
she
had
first
seen
the
man
asleep
in
the
grass
and
now
as
she
opened
her
eyes
in
the
darkness
a
sudden
rush
of
fear
swept
over
her
such
as
she
had
experienced
in
the
old
it
was
not
fear
of
any
definite
thing
she
could
be
as
brave
as
any
one
in
the
face
of
visible
danger
it
was
merely
a
wild
unreasoning
sensation
of
physical
terror
bred
of
the
dark
and
overwrought
nerves
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
sybert
to
be
sure
he
was
there
the
next
moment
she
was
beyond
herself
i
m
afraid
she
sobbed
out
and
she
clung
to
him
convulsively
she
felt
him
put
his
arm
around
her
marcia
my
dear
little
girl
there
s
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
when
they
find
we
are
on
our
guard
they
won
t
dare
molest
us
nothing
can
hurt
it
was
so
exactly
his
tone
to
gerald
she
would
have
laughed
had
she
not
been
crying
too
hard
to
stop
then
suddenly
his
arms
tightened
about
her
marcia
he
whispered
hoarsely
marcia
and
he
bent
his
head
until
his
lips
touched
hers
they
stood
for
an
instant
without
moving
then
she
felt
him
become
quickly
rigid
as
he
dropped
his
arms
and
gently
loosened
her
hands
they
groped
their
way
into
the
hall
without
a
word
and
neither
looked
at
the
other
they
were
both
ashamed
the
tears
still
stood
in
marcia
s
eyes
but
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
sybert
was
pale
beneath
the
olive
of
his
skin
he
stepped
to
the
threshold
of
the
salon
ah
copley
he
said
in
a
low
tone
are
you
nearly
through
i
want
to
tell
you
copley
waved
him
off
without
looking
up
s
a
crucial
moment
don
t
interrupt
the
scores
are
even
and
only
one
hand
more
to
play
i
ll
be
out
in
a
few
marcia
sat
down
in
a
chair
on
the
loggia
it
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
the
ilex
grove
and
besides
her
spasm
of
fear
had
passed
everything
was
blotted
out
of
her
mind
except
what
had
just
happened
her
thoughts
her
feelings
were
in
wild
commotion
but
one
thing
stood
out
clearly
she
had
thrown
herself
into
his
arms
and
he
had
kissed
her
and
had
unloosed
her
hands
she
shut
her
eyes
and
winced
at
the
thought
she
felt
that
she
could
never
face
him
again
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
loggia
sybert
was
pacing
up
and
down
lighting
cigarettes
and
throwing
them
away
he
too
was
fiercely
calling
himself
names
he
had
frightened
her
when
he
knew
that
she
was
beside
herself
with
nervousness
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
fact
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
he
knew
that
she
was
engaged
to
paul
dessart
and
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
a
gentleman
with
a
quick
glance
toward
the
salon
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
crossing
the
loggia
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
marcia
s
side
she
shrank
back
quickly
and
he
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
eyes
on
the
brick
floor
marcia
he
said
in
a
tone
so
low
that
it
was
barely
audible
i
love
you
i
know
you
don
t
care
for
me
i
know
you
are
engaged
to
another
man
i
didn
t
mean
to
see
you
again
most
of
all
i
didn
t
mean
to
tell
you
i
had
no
right
to
take
advantage
of
you
when
you
were
off
your
guard
couldn
t
help
it
i
m
not
so
strong
as
i
thought
i
was
please
forgive
me
and
forget
about
marcia
drew
a
deep
breath
and
shut
her
eyes
her
throat
suddenly
felt
hot
and
dry
the
rush
of
joy
that
swept
over
her
made
her
feel
that
she
could
face
anything
she
had
but
to
say
i
am
not
engaged
to
another
man
and
all
would
come
right
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
back
into
sybert
s
deep
eyes
it
was
he
this
time
who
dropped
his
gaze
mr
she
whispered
a
shadow
suddenly
fell
between
them
and
they
both
sprang
to
their
feet
with
a
little
exclamation
a
man
was
standing
before
them
as
unexpectedly
as
though
he
had
risen
from
the
earth
or
dropped
from
the
sky
he
was
short
and
with
coarsely
accentuated
features
he
wore
a
loose
white
shirt
and
a
red
cotton
sash
and
though
the
shirt
was
fastened
at
the
throat
marcia
could
see
the
mark
of
the
crucifix
on
his
brown
skin
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
visible
it
s
the
tattooed
man
she
gasped
out
but
as
she
felt
sybert
s
restraining
touch
on
her
arm
she
calmed
herself
the
man
took
off
his
hat
with
a
polite
bow
and
an
impertinent
smile
signorina
he
murmured
friend
of
the
poor
i
m
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
i
come
on
business
what
is
your
business
sybert
asked
sharply

business

signor
what

this
some
one
to

copley
asked
appearing
in
the
doorway
well
my
man
he
added
in
italian
what

do
for

to
him
it
s
the
tattooed
man
marcia
cried
there
s
a
plot
he
wants
to
kill
an
expression
approaching
amusement
flitted
over
copley
s
face
as
he
looked
his
visitor
over
i
wish
to
speak
to
the
signore
alone
in
private
on
urgent
business
the
man
reiterated
looking
scowlingly
from
one
face
to
the
other
he
did
not
understand
the
foreign
language
they
spoke
among
themselves
and
he
felt
that
it
gave
them
an
advantage
don
t
speak
to
him
alone
sybert
warned
he
s
well
what
do
you
want
copley
demanded
peremptorily
say
whatever
you
have
to
say
the
man
glanced
at
marcia
and
sybert
and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
true
italian
fashion
turned
to
copley
i
wish
the
money
of
the
poor
he
said
the
money
of
the
poor
i
haven
t
any
money
of
the
signore
the
money
you
stole
from
the
mouths
of
the
wheat
marcia
shuddered
at
the
word
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
follow
her
to
her
dying
day
ah
so
it
s
the
wheat
money
is
it
well
my
good
man
that
happens
to
be
my
money
i
didn
t
steal
it
from
the
mouths
of
the
poor
i
bought
the
wheat
myself
to
give
to
the
poor
and
i
sold
it
for
half
as
much
as
i
paid
for
it
and
with
the
money
i
intend
to
buy
more
wheat
in
the
meantime
however
i
shall
keep
it
in
my
own
you
don
t
remember
me
signore
but
i
remember
you
we
met
in
copley
bowed
on
which
occasion
i
put
you
in
pleasure
i
shall
avail
myself
of
a
second
time
if
you
trouble
me
any
i
have
come
for
the
you
fool
do
you
think
i
carry
thirty
thousand
lire
around
in
my
pockets
the
money
is
in
the
d
in
rome
you
may
call
there
if
you
wish
the
man
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
whistled
ah
it
s
a
plot
is
it
copley
exclaimed
signore
it
is
a
plot
and
there
are
those
who
will
carry
it
he
turned
with
an
angry
snarl
and
before
sybert
could
spring
forward
to
stop
him
he
had
snatched
a
stiletto
from
his
girdle
copley
threw
up
his
arm
to
protect
himself
and
received
the
blow
in
the
shoulder
before
the
man
could
strike
again
sybert
was
upon
him
and
had
thrown
him
backward
across
the
balustrade
at
the
same
moment
half
a
dozen
men
burst
from
the
ilex
grove
and
ran
across
the
terrace
and
one
of
was
the
stolen
rifle
as
he
ran
back
into
the
house
sybert
shouted
and
bar
the
salon
he
himself
sprang
back
to
the
threshold
and
snatched
out
his
revolver
you
fools
he
cried
to
the
italians
in
front
we
re
all
armed
men
we
ll
shoot
you
like
for
answer
pietro
fired
the
rifle
and
the
glass
of
an
upper
window
crashed
sybert
closed
the
door
and
dropped
the
bar
across
it
he
faced
the
excited
group
in
the
hall
with
a
little
laugh
if
that
s
a
specimen
of
his
marksmanship
we
haven
t
much
to
fear
from
he
glanced
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
marcia
in
the
salon
was
slamming
the
shutters
down
melville
and
copley
were
standing
in
the
doorway
with
white
faces
too
amazed
to
move
copley
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
with
his
right
arm
hanging
limp
was
dripping
blood
on
the
marble
pavement
while
he
loudly
called
for
a
pistol
and
melville
was
standing
on
a
chair
hastily
tearing
from
the
wall
a
collection
of
florentine
arms
pietro
s
got
your
pistol
sybert
said
but
i
ve
got
five
shots
in
mine
and
we
ll
do
for
the
sixth
man
with
one
of
those
bludgeons
i
ought
to
have
shot
that
tattooed
fellow
when
i
had
the
s
the
i
ll
make
up
for
it
a
storm
of
blows
on
the
door
behind
him
brought
out
another
laugh
that
door
is
as
solid
as
the
side
of
the
house
they
can
hammer
on
it
all
night
without
getting
the
assailants
had
evidently
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
for
the
blows
ceased
while
they
consulted
a
crash
of
glass
in
the
salon
followed
and
sybert
sprang
in
there
calling
to
melville
to
guard
the
hall
window
the
shutters
held
against
the
first
impact
of
the
men
s
bodies
and
they
drew
off
for
a
minute
and
then
redoubled
the
blows
they
were
evidently
using
the
butt
of
the
rifle
as
a
and
the
stoutest
of
hinges
could
not
long
withstand
such
usage
with
a
groan
one
side
of
the
shutter
gave
way
and
swung
inward
on
a
single
hinge
put
out
the
lights
sybert
called
over
his
shoulder
to
marcia
and
he
fired
a
shot
through
the
aperture
the
assailants
fell
back
with
groans
and
curses
but
the
next
moment
raising
the
cry
avanti
they
came
on
with
a
rush
the
camorrist
leading
with
the
stolen
revolver
in
his
hand
sybert
took
deliberate
aim
and
fired
the
man
slowly
sank
to
his
knees
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
his
comrades
dragged
him
back
marcia
in
the
darkness
behind
shut
her
eyes
and
clenched
her
hands
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
a
person
die
and
the
sight
was
sickening
the
men
withdrew
from
the
window
and
those
waiting
inside
heard
them
consulting
in
low
angry
guttural
tones
the
next
moment
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
at
the
hall
window
which
opened
into
the
loggia
and
again
the
rifle
as
a
ah
said
sybert
under
his
breath
and
he
thrust
the
revolver
into
marcia
s
hand
quick
take
that
to
melville
and
bring
me
one
of
those
spiked
truncheons
we
ll
make
em
think
we
ve
got
a
regular
arsenal
in
marcia
obeyed
without
a
word
and
the
next
moment
shots
and
cries
rang
out
in
the
hall
she
had
scarcely
placed
the
unwieldy
weapon
in
sybert
s
hands
when
another
man
thrust
himself
into
the
salon
opening
they
had
evidently
determined
to
divide
their
forces
and
attack
the
two
breaches
at
once
both
marcia
and
sybert
recognized
the
man
instantly
it
was
tarquinio
the
son
of
domenico
the
baker
of
castel
vivalanti
tarquinio
you
fool
go
back
sybert
cried
siberti
the
young
fellow
cried
as
he
lunged
forward
with
a
stiletto
you
have
betrayed
us
sybert
shut
his
lips
and
reversing
the
truncheon
struck
him
with
the
handle
a
ringing
blow
on
the
head
tarquinio
fell
forward
into
the
darkness
of
the
room
and
the
moonlight
streamed
in
on
his
bloody
face
sybert
bent
over
him
a
moment
with
white
lips
you
poor
fool
he
muttered
i
had
to
do
the
next
moment
marcia
uttered
a
joyous
cry
that
rang
through
the
rooms
listen
a
silence
of
ten
seconds
followed
while
both
besieged
and
besiegers
held
their
breath
the
sound
was
shout
far
down
the
avenue
and
the
beat
of
galloping
hoofs
the
soldiers
she
cried
and
the
men
outside
as
if
they
had
understood
the
word
echoed
the
cry
soldati
i
soldati
the
next
moment
a
dozen
carabinieri
swept
into
sight
the
moonlight
gleaming
brightly
on
their
white
and
polished
mountings
the
men
on
the
loggia
dropped
their
weapons
and
dashed
for
cover
while
the
soldiers
leaped
from
their
horses
and
with
spiked
muskets
chased
them
into
the
trees
sybert
hastily
bent
over
tarquinio
and
dragged
him
back
into
the
shadow
is
he
alive
marcia
whispered
he
s
only
stunned
and
poor
fellow
he
doesn
t
know
any
better
he
was
nothing
but
their
dupe
it
s
a
pity
to
send
him
to
the
galleys
for
they
dropped
a
rug
over
the
man
and
turned
into
the
hall
which
was
hot
with
the
smell
of
powder
and
smoking
candles
sybert
threw
the
door
wide
and
let
the
moonlight
stream
in
it
was
a
queer
sight
it
looked
upon
copley
weak
from
his
wound
had
collapsed
into
a
tall
carved
chair
while
the
two
ladies
in
evening
dresses
were
anxiously
bending
over
him
melville
with
the
still
smoking
revolver
in
his
hand
and
a
jewelled
dagger
sticking
from
his
pocket
was
frenziedly
inquiring
for
the
lord
s
sake
has
any
one
got
any
whisky
gerald
in
his
white
nightgown
and
little
bare
legs
was
howling
dismally
on
the
stairway
while
granton
from
the
landing
looked
grimly
down
upon
the
scene
with
the
air
of
an
avenging
nemesis
the
next
moment
the
soldiers
had
come
trooping
in
and
everything
was
a
babel
of
cries
and
ejaculations
and
excited
questions
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
copley
suddenly
drew
herself
up
and
pronounced
her
ultimatum
on
the
very
first
steamer
that
sails
we
are
going
back
to
america
to
marcia
uttered
a
little
hysterical
laugh
and
melville
joined
in
and
i
think
you
d
better
go
with
them
my
boy
he
said
laying
a
grimy
hand
on
sybert
s
arm
i
suspect
that
your
goose
is
pretty
thoroughly
cooked
in
sybert
shook
the
elder
man
s
hand
off
with
a
short
laugh
that
was
not
very
mirthful
i
ve
suspected
that
for
some
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
out
to
the
loggia
where
he
began
talking
with
the
soldiers
poor
fellow
melville
glanced
at
marcia
and
shook
his
head
it
s
a
bad
dose
he
murmured
i
have
a
curiosity
to
see
with
what
grace
he
swallows
marcia
looked
after
sybert
with
eyes
that
were
filled
with
sympathy
she
realized
that
it
was
a
bitter
time
for
him
though
she
did
not
know
just
why
but
she
had
seen
the
spasm
that
crossed
his
face
at
tarquinio
s
cry
you
have
betrayed
us
she
half
started
to
follow
him
and
then
she
drew
back
quickly
through
the
open
door
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
sybert
and
a
soldier
bending
over
the
camorrist
s
body
they
had
opened
his
shirt
in
front
and
she
had
seen
the
purple
crucifix
covered
with
blood
she
leaned
back
against
the
wall
faint
at
the
sight
it
seemed
as
if
the
impressions
of
this
dreadful
day
could
never
leave
her
chapter
xxv
copley
s
wounded
arm
was
bandaged
the
best
that
they
could
manage
and
a
soldier
dispatched
to
palestrina
for
a
doctor
gerald
was
put
to
bed
and
quieted
for
the
third
time
that
night
and
the
excitement
in
the
house
was
subsiding
to
a
murmur
when
marcia
came
downstairs
again
melville
met
her
by
the
door
of
the
loggia
evidently
anxious
that
she
should
not
go
out
she
had
no
desire
to
she
had
seen
more
than
she
cared
to
see
we
have
caught
two
of
the
men
he
said
but
i
am
afraid
that
the
rest
have
got
precious
butler
of
yours
among
where
is
sybert
she
asked
the
thought
of
tarquinio
had
suddenly
occurred
to
her
she
had
forgotten
him
in
the
distraction
of
helping
with
her
uncle
he
s
locking
the
i
will
see
if
i
can
help
him
and
she
turned
into
the
salon
melville
looked
after
her
with
a
momentary
smile
he
had
a
theory
which
his
wife
did
not
share
marcia
passed
through
the
empty
salon
and
the
little
and
hesitated
with
her
hand
on
the
door
she
had
a
premonition
that
he
was
within
she
turned
the
knob
softly
and
entered
sybert
sprang
up
with
a
quick
exclamation
oh
it
s
you
he
said
i
thought
i
had
locked
the
door
draw
the
bolt
please
i
brought
him
in
here
and
i
m
trying
to
bring
him
round
if
they
find
him
he
ll
be
sent
to
the
galleys
and
it
seems
a
pity
he
s
got
a
wife
and
child
to
marcia
looked
down
on
the
floor
where
tarquinio
was
lying
sybert
had
thrown
the
glass
doors
open
again
and
the
moonlight
was
flooding
the
room
a
towel
folded
into
a
rough
bandage
was
wrapped
around
the
young
italian
s
head
and
his
pale
face
beneath
it
had
all
the
dark
tragic
beauty
of
his
race
poor
man
she
exclaimed
as
she
bent
over
him
are
you
sure
he
s
alive
she
asked
starting
back
heavens
yes
it
takes
more
than
that
knock
to
kill
one
of
these
peasants
he
groaned
when
i
carried
him
in
here
let
me
give
him
some
he
raised
the
man
s
head
and
pressed
the
flask
to
his
lip
tarquinio
groaned
again
and
presently
he
opened
his
eyes
sybert
raised
him
to
a
sitting
posture
against
the
wall
for
a
moment
his
glance
wandered
about
the
room
uncomprehendingly
dully
then
as
it
fixed
upon
sybert
a
wild
fierce
light
suddenly
sprang
into
his
eyes
traitor
he
gasped
out
and
he
struggled
to
his
feet
again
marcia
saw
that
quick
look
of
pain
shoot
over
sybert
s
face
he
swallowed
a
couple
of
times
before
speaking
and
when
he
did
speak
his
voice
was
hard
and
cold
can
you
walk
then
climb
over
that
railing
and
get
away
as
fast
as
you
can
the
soldiers
are
here
and
if
they
find
you
they
will
send
you
to
the
that
it
would
be
any
great
loss
he
added
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
italy
has
no
need
of
such
men
as
something
of
the
fierceness
faded
from
the
young
fellow
s
face
and
he
looked
back
with
the
pleading
eyes
of
the
italian
peasant
the
two
men
watched
each
other
a
moment
without
speaking
then
tarquinio
turned
to
the
open
door
with
a
shrug
of
the
italy
s
philosophy
of
life
they
stood
silently
looking
after
him
as
he
let
himself
down
to
the
ground
and
unsteadily
crossed
the
open
space
to
the
shadow
of
the
grove
sybert
was
the
first
to
move
he
turned
aside
with
a
tired
sigh
that
was
half
a
groan
and
dropping
into
a
chair
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
all
the
wild
buoyancy
that
had
kept
him
through
the
evening
had
left
him
and
there
was
nothing
in
its
place
but
a
dull
unreasoning
despair
for
the
last
few
weeks
he
had
been
glancing
at
the
truth
askance
he
was
looking
it
full
in
the
face
the
people
no
longer
trusted
him
he
could
do
no
more
good
in
italy
his
work
was
at
an
end
why
had
they
not
killed
him
that
would
have
been
the
appropriate
conclusion
marcia
watching
his
bowed
figure
dimly
divined
what
was
going
on
within
his
mind
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
with
a
quick
impulse
laid
her
arm
about
his
neck
there
isn
t
any
one
but
you
she
whispered
he
sat
for
a
moment
motionless
and
then
he
slowly
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
what
do
you
mean
marcia
i
love
re
free
to
marry
me
she
nodded
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
deep
shuddering
breath
of
relief
i
ve
lost
italy
marcia
but
i
ve
found
you
she
smiled
up
at
him
through
her
tears
and
he
looked
back
with
sombre
eyes
you
aren
t
getting
much
of
a
man
he
said
brokenly
just
thinking
of
shooting
a
quick
tremor
passed
over
her
and
she
drew
his
face
down
close
to
hers
and
kissed
it
they
stood
for
a
long
time
on
the
little
balcony
hand
in
hand
facing
the
shadows
of
the
ilex
grove
but
the
shadows
no
longer
seemed
black
because
of
the
light
in
their
own
souls
he
talked
to
her
of
his
of
italy
his
adopted
land
he
told
her
what
he
had
tried
to
do
and
wherein
he
had
failed
and
as
she
listened
many
things
that
had
puzzled
her
that
had
seemed
enigmas
in
his
character
assumed
their
right
relations
the
dark
glass
that
had
half
hidden
his
motives
that
had
contorted
his
actions
suddenly
cleared
before
her
eyes
she
saw
the
inherent
sweetness
and
strength
of
his
nature
beneath
his
reserve
his
apparent
indifference
and
as
he
told
the
story
of
italy
of
the
sacrifices
and
valour
and
singleness
of
purpose
that
had
gone
to
the
making
of
the
nation
there
crept
involuntarily
a
triumphant
ring
into
his
voice
the
note
of
despondency
that
had
dominated
him
for
the
past
few
months
disappeared
for
as
he
dwelt
upon
the
positive
things
that
had
been
accomplished
they
seemed
to
take
shape
and
stand
out
clearly
against
the
dimmer
background
of
unaccomplished
hopes
the
remembrance
of
the
nation
s
smaller
mistakes
and
faults
and
crimes
had
vanished
in
the
larger
view
the
story
that
he
had
to
tell
was
the
story
of
a
great
people
and
a
great
land
there
had
been
patriots
in
the
past
there
would
be
patriots
in
the
future
the
same
strength
that
had
made
the
nation
would
build
it
up
and
carry
it
on
ah
sybert
miss
marcia
melville
s
voice
rang
through
the
house
i
d
forgotten
there
was
any
one
in
the
world
but
us
marcia
whispered
as
they
turned
back
into
the
hall
here
s
a
young
gentleman
calling
for
you
miss
melville
s
hand
rested
on
the
shoulder
of
a
barefooted
little
figure
covered
with
the
white
dust
of
the
roman
road
gervasio
marcia
cried
with
a
quick
spasm
of
she
had
forgotten
him
the
boy
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
pointed
through
the
open
door
to
the
soldiers
pacing
the
length
of
the
terrace
signorina
soldati
marcia
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
him
with
a
little
laugh
you
darling
she
cried
as
she
gathered
him
into
her
arms
and
kissed
him
sybert
bent
over
him
and
shook
his
hand
you
re
a
brave
boy
gervasio
he
said
and
you
ve
probably
saved
our
lives
am
i
going
to
live
with
you
now
he
asked
like
gerald
always
said
marcia
just
like
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
will
i
be
an
americano
then
no
gervasio
said
sybert
quickly
you
ll
never
be
an
americano
you
were
born
italiano
and
you
ll
be
italiano
till
you
die
you
should
be
proud
of
s
your
birthright
we
are
americani
and
we
are
you
may
come
with
us
and
study
and
learn
but
when
you
get
to
be
a
man
you
must
come
back
to
your
own
country
it
will
need
now
run
to
bed
and
you
too
miss
marcia
he
added
you
are
tired
and
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
melville
and
i
will
attend
to
locking
locking
up
cried
melville
good
lord
man
how
many
does
this
house
require
he
watched
them
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
he
added
bluntly
oh
see
here
what
s
the
good
of
secrets
between
friends
i
ve
known
it
all
he
held
out
a
hand
to
each
of
them
it
s
eminently
fitting
my
congratulations
come
from
my
you
re
too
discerning
by
far
sybert
retorted
his
hands
fast
in
his
pockets
marcia
with
a
laugh
and
a
quick
flush
held
out
both
of
hers
it
s
a
secret
she
said
i
don
t
know
how
you
guessed
it
but
you
must
promise
on
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
and
a
diplomat
not
to
tell
a
single
soul
i
must
tell
my
wife
he
pleaded
it
s
a
case
of
i
told
you
so
and
she
usually
comes
out
ahead
in
such
cases
you
can
t
ask
me
to
hide
what
little
light
i
have
under
a
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
melville
marcia
gave
a
reluctant
consent
but
promise
me
one
thing
that
you
ll
never
never
breathe
a
word
don
t
know
her
lady
who
the
lady
who
writes
who
on
earth
is
she
talking
about
sybert
the
greatest
gossip
in
rome
appended
marcia
madame
laventi
melville
laughed
you
re
too
late
miss
marcia
she
knows
it
already
madame
laventi
does
not
get
her
news
by
word
of
mouth
the
birds
carry
it
to
her
good
night
he
added
and
he
strolled
discreetly
into
the
salon
but
his
caution
was
unnecessary
their
parting
was
blatantly
innocent
sybert
chose
a
tall
brass
candlestick
from
the
row
on
the
mantelpiece
and
handed
it
to
her
with
a
bow
thank
you
said
marcia
she
paused
on
the
landing
and
smiled
down
signor
siberti
she
murmured
he
smiled
back
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
signorina
pleasant
dreams
hearing
the
sound
of
voices
within
marcia
paused
at
copley
s
door
to
ask
about
her
uncle
she
found
the
room
strewn
with
the
contents
of
several
wardrobes
and
her
aunt
and
granton
kneeling
each
before
an
open
trunk
good
gracious
aunt
katherine
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
what
you
doing
it
s
one
o
we
are
my
marcia
sat
down
on
the
bed
with
a
hysterical
giggle
aunt
katherine
if
i
didn
t
know
the
contrary
i
should
swear
you
were
born
a
copley
withdrew
her
head
from
the
trunk
and
looked
about
for
something
further
to
fit
in
in
passing
she
cast
her
niece
a
reproachful
glance
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
be
so
flippant
marcia
after
what
we
ve
been
through
with
your
uncle
lying
wounded
in
the
next
room
it
s
only
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
we
aren
t
all
in
our
graves
by
now
i
shall
not
draw
an
easy
breath
until
we
have
landed
safely
in
the
streets
of
new
york
just
hand
me
that
pile
of
things
on
the
chair
her
gaze
rested
upon
a
assortment
of
ribbons
and
laces
and
gloves
marcia
suppressed
another
smile
i
know
it
isn
t
the
time
to
laugh
aunt
katherine
but
i
can
t
help
it
you
re
of
businesslike
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
me
to
pack
we
are
going
into
rome
the
first
thing
morning
and
with
only
granton
to
help
there
is
no
time
to
lose
we
might
as
well
begin
while
we
are
waiting
for
the
surely
ought
to
be
here
by
now
she
added
her
anxiety
coming
to
the
fore
what
do
you
suppose
takes
him
so
long
it
s
been
an
hour
since
we
it
s
four
miles
to
palestrina
aunt
katherine
and
you
must
remember
it
s
the
middle
of
the
night
the
man
was
probably
in
bed
and
asleep
it
will
be
another
half
hour
at
least
before
he
can
get
yes
i
suppose
so
copley
turned
back
to
her
but
i
can
t
help
being
worried
one
suspects
everybody
after
an
experience
like
this
i
am
really
feeling
very
nervous
over
your
uncle
s
arm
he
makes
light
of
it
but
it
may
be
more
serious
than
any
of
us
think
there
s
always
so
much
danger
of
lockjaw
or
from
a
wound
of
that
sort
i
shall
not
feel
satisfied
about
it
until
we
can
get
into
rome
and
consult
an
american
may
i
see
him
marcia
asked
or
is
he
asleep
no
he
s
awake
but
you
must
not
excite
marcia
tapped
lightly
on
copley
s
door
and
entered
he
was
propped
up
on
pillows
his
arm
in
a
sling
she
crossed
over
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
m
so
sorry
uncle
howard
she
murmured
oh
it
s
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
over
i
got
off
very
i
don
t
mean
just
your
ah
said
copley
and
shut
his
eyes
but
after
all
she
added
it
may
be
for
the
best
the
italians
don
t
understand
what
you
are
doing
i
don
t
believe
two
such
different
races
can
understand
each
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
humorous
smile
it
s
rather
a
ending
he
agreed
i
have
a
feeling
that
before
the
curtain
goes
down
i
should
join
hands
with
the
bandits
and
come
out
and
make
my
there
are
lots
of
things
to
be
done
in
america
and
they
ll
appreciate
you
more
at
i
think
i
ll
buy
a
yacht
and
go
in
for
racing
as
your
aunt
suggests
i
may
come
off
in
i
have
a
marcia
sat
silent
a
moment
looking
down
on
his
finely
lined
sensitive
face
uncle
howard
she
said
slowly
it
seems
as
if
the
good
you
do
is
some
way
cast
up
to
the
credit
side
of
the
world
s
account
and
helps
just
so
much
to
overcome
the
bad
whether
any
one
knows
about
it
or
not
you
may
go
away
and
leave
it
all
behind
and
never
be
appreciated
but
it
s
a
positive
quantity
just
the
same
it
s
so
much
accomplished
on
the
right
her
uncle
smiled
again
i
m
afraid
that
s
rather
too
idealistic
a
philosophy
for
this
generation
we
re
living
in
a
material
age
and
it
takes
something
more
solid
than
good
intentions
to
make
much
impression
on
it
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
i
wasn
t
born
to
set
the
world
to
rights
many
men
are
reformers
in
their
youth
but
i
m
reaching
the
age
when
a
club
and
a
good
dinner
are
excellent
anodynes
for
my
own
and
other
people
s
a
shadow
fell
over
her
face
and
she
looked
down
in
her
lap
without
answering
after
a
moment
he
asked
suddenly
where
s
sybert
marcia
i
think
he
s
downstairs
waiting
for
the
ah
said
copley
again
with
a
little
sigh
marcia
slipped
down
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
uncle
howard
she
whispered
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
to
marry
copley
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
stared
at
her
you
are
going
to
marry
sybert
he
repeated
incredulously
yes
uncle
she
smiled
he
asked
me
sybert
copley
repeated
with
an
astonished
laugh
holy
francis
what
a
change
is
here
i
thought
you
would
be
pleased
she
said
a
little
tremulously
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
over
hers
my
dear
marcia
nothing
could
have
pleased
me
more
he
s
the
finest
man
i
have
ever
known
and
i
begin
to
suspect
that
you
are
the
finest
girl
gracious
marcia
i
must
be
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
i
had
a
notion
you
didn
t
like
each
we
ve
changed
our
minds
she
said
and
i
wanted
you
to
know
it
because
i
thought
it
would
make
you
feel
and
so
it
does
marcia
he
said
heartily
the
year
has
accomplished
something
after
all
and
i
m
glad
for
sybert
s
sake
that
he
s
got
this
just
now
for
poor
fellow
he
s
in
a
deeper
hole
than
marcia
pressed
his
hand
gratefully
as
her
aunt
came
bustling
in
with
her
arms
full
of
clothes
howard
she
asked
shall
i
have
granton
pack
your
heavy
flannels
or
shall
you
want
them
on
the
steamer
her
husband
attempted
a
shrug
and
found
the
bandages
would
not
permit
it
i
think
perhaps
i
d
better
leave
them
out
it
s
june
of
course
but
i
ve
known
very
cold
crossings
even
in
copley
turned
on
his
side
and
wrenched
his
arm
again
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
katherine
he
groaned
pack
them
throw
them
away
burn
them
do
anything
you
copley
came
to
the
bedside
and
bent
over
him
anxiously
what
s
the
matter
dear
is
your
arm
very
painful
you
don
t
suppose
she
added
in
sudden
alarm
that
the
stiletto
was
poisoned
do
you
lord
no
he
laughed
poisoned
daggers
went
out
two
centuries
s
a
mere
scratch
katherine
don
t
worry
about
it
go
on
with
your
should
hate
to
miss
that
first
his
wife
patted
the
pillows
and
turned
toward
the
door
marcia
she
called
over
her
shoulder
go
to
bed
child
you
will
be
absolutely
worn
out
don
t
talk
to
your
uncle
any
more
i
m
afraid
you
will
get
him
marcia
bent
over
and
lightly
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
good
night
she
whispered
i
hope
you
will
feel
better
in
the
morning
and
she
turned
back
to
her
own
room
she
sat
down
on
the
couch
by
the
open
window
and
drew
the
muslin
curtains
back
the
moon
was
low
in
the
west
hanging
over
rome
a
cool
night
breeze
was
stirring
and
the
little
chill
that
precedes
dawn
was
in
the
air
she
drew
a
rug
about
her
and
sat
looking
out
listening
to
the
shuffling
tramp
of
the
soldiers
and
thinking
of
the
long
day
that
had
passed
when
she
waked
that
morning
it
had
been
like
any
other
day
and
now
everything
was
changed
this
was
her
last
night
in
the
villa
and
her
heart
was
full
of
happiness
and
for
her
uncle
and
laurence
sybert
and
the
poor
peasants
it
was
italy
to
the
and
moonlight
and
love
mingled
with
tragedy
and
death
and
disappointment
she
had
a
great
many
things
to
think
about
but
she
was
very
very
tired
and
with
a
and
a
her
head
drooped
on
the
cushions
and
she
fell
asleep
chapter
xxvi
marcia
woke
at
dawn
with
the
sun
in
her
eyes
she
started
up
dazedly
at
finding
herself
dressed
in
her
white
evening
gown
lying
on
the
couch
instead
of
in
bed
then
in
a
moment
the
events
of
yesterday
flashed
back
the
floor
was
covered
with
broken
glass
and
on
the
wall
opposite
a
dark
spot
among
the
showed
where
pietro
s
misaimed
bullet
had
lodged
on
the
terrace
balustrade
below
her
window
two
soldiers
were
sitting
busily
throwing
dice
they
lent
an
absurd
air
of
unreality
to
the
scene
she
stepped
to
the
open
doors
of
the
balcony
and
drew
a
deep
delighted
breath
of
the
fresh
morning
air
rome
in
the
west
was
still
sleeping
but
every
separate
crag
of
the
sabines
was
glowing
a
soft
pink
and
the
newly
risen
sun
was
hanging
like
a
halo
behind
the
old
monastery
it
was
a
day
filled
with
promise
the
next
moment
she
had
brought
her
thoughts
back
from
the
distant
horizon
to
the
contemplation
of
homelier
matters
nearer
at
hand
mingled
with
the
early
fragrance
of
roses
and
dew
was
the
subtly
penetrating
odour
of
boiling
coffee
marcia
sniffed
and
considered
some
one
was
making
coffee
for
the
soldiers
who
were
to
be
relieved
at
the
ave
she
reviewed
the
possible
cooks
not
granton
the
soldiers
were
italians
and
for
all
granton
cared
they
could
perish
from
hunger
on
their
way
back
to
palestrina
not
her
aunt
in
all
probability
she
did
not
know
how
to
make
coffee
not
her
uncle
he
was
de
with
his
wounded
arm
the
melvilles
they
would
not
have
known
where
to
look
for
the
kitchen
she
interrupted
her
speculations
to
exchange
last
night
s
evening
gown
for
a
fresh
blue
muslin
and
her
hasty
glance
at
the
mirror
as
she
stole
out
on
tiptoe
told
her
that
the
slight
pallor
which
comes
from
three
hours
sleep
was
not
unbecoming
she
crept
downstairs
through
the
dim
hall
and
paused
a
second
by
the
open
door
of
the
loggia
her
eyes
involuntarily
sought
the
spot
outside
the
salon
window
the
rug
was
back
in
its
place
again
and
everything
was
in
its
usual
order
she
felt
thankful
to
some
one
it
was
easier
so
to
throw
the
matter
from
her
mind
she
approached
the
kitchen
softly
and
paused
on
the
threshold
with
a
reconnoitring
glance
the
big
room
with
its
smoky
rafters
overhead
was
dark
always
but
especially
so
at
the
sunrise
hour
its
windows
looked
to
the
west
in
the
farthest
darkest
corner
before
the
big
stove
some
one
was
standing
with
his
back
turned
toward
her
and
her
heart
quickened
its
beating
perceptibly
she
stood
very
still
for
several
minutes
watching
him
she
would
hypnotise
him
to
turn
around
but
before
she
had
fairly
commenced
with
the
business
he
had
picked
up
the
poker
by
the
wrong
end
and
dropped
it
again
the
observation
which
he
made
in
italian
was
quite
untranslatable
marcia
tittered
and
he
wheeled
about
that
s
not
fair
he
objected
i
shouldn
t
have
said
anything
so
bad
if
i
had
known
you
were
do
you
know
what
we
do
with
gerald
when
he
swears
in
italian
he
shook
his
head
we
wash
his
mouth
with
i
hope
it
doesn
t
happen
often
he
shuddered
he
speaks
very
fluent
as
fluent
as
suppose
we
change
the
very
well
she
agreed
advancing
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
long
central
table
what
shall
we
talk
about
we
haven
t
said
good
she
dropped
him
a
smiling
curtsy
good
morning
mr
sybert
you
haven
t
changed
your
mind
overnight
have
you
her
eyes
were
more
reassuring
than
her
speech
no
what
she
laughed
he
came
around
to
her
side
of
the
table
and
faced
her
with
his
hands
in
his
jacket
pockets
you
ve
never
in
your
life
pronounced
my
name
i
don
t
believe
you
know
it
she
whispered
say
it
it
sounds
too
familiar
she
objected
backing
against
the
wall
with
impudently
laughing
eyes
you
re
sort
of
uncle
oh
i
know
you
re
young
but
you
needn
t
put
on
such
airs
about
it
you
don
t
own
all
the
youth
in
the
she
murmured
with
a
wondering
shake
of
her
head
a
very
nice
age
just
the
right
age
in
fact
to
make
you
mind
me
oh
you
needn
t
laugh
i
m
going
to
do
it
fast
enough
and
right
here
we
ll
he
folded
his
arms
with
a
very
fierce
frown
but
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
quizzical
humorous
comprehending
finished
result
of
so
many
smiles
that
had
gone
before
the
business
in
hand
my
dear
young
woman
is
to
find
out
whether
or
not
you
happen
to
know
the
name
of
the
man
you
ve
promised
to
marry
come
let
me
hear
it
say
it
out
marcia
looked
back
tantalizingly
a
moment
and
then
after
an
inquiring
glance
about
the
room
as
if
she
were
searching
to
recall
it
she
dropped
her
lids
and
pronounced
it
with
her
eyes
on
the
floor
he
unfolded
his
arms
the
coffee
s
boiling
over
marcia
exclaimed
kiss
me
good
the
coffee
s
boiling
i
don
t
care
if
it
the
coffee
boiled
over
with
an
angry
spurt
that
deluged
the
stove
with
hissing
steam
marcia
was
patently
too
anxious
for
its
safety
to
give
her
attention
to
anything
else
sybert
stalked
over
and
viciously
jerked
it
back
and
she
picked
up
the
plate
of
rolls
and
ran
for
the
door
he
caught
up
with
her
in
the
hall
i
know
why
you
discharged
marietta
he
threw
out
why
if
i
were
a
french
cook
with
a
moustache
and
a
goatee
and
a
fetching
white
cap
and
you
were
a
little
italian
nursemaid
with
gold
in
your
ears
i
should
very
frequently
let
things
oh
marcia
laughed
and
i
should
probably
let
the
little
boy
i
ought
to
be
looking
after
fall
over
the
balustrade
and
break
his
front
tooth
while
i
was
sitting
on
the
smiling
at
and
so
we
should
be
torn
was
a
tragedy
he
mused
compassionately
i
hadn
t
realized
it
before
it
proves
that
you
must
suffer
yourself
before
you
can
appreciate
the
sufferings
of
french
cooks
with
fetching
caps
have
elastic
ah
said
he
and
so
have
little
italian
m
glad
you
re
not
an
italian
nursemaid
i
m
glad
you
re
not
a
french
and
then
she
laughed
will
you
tell
me
something
anything
you
were
you
ever
in
love
with
the
contessa
torrenieri
i
used
to
fancy
i
was
something
of
the
sort
nine
or
ten
years
ago
but
thank
heaven
she
was
looking
for
a
i
m
glad
she
found
him
marcia
breathed
as
they
crossed
the
terrace
to
the
little
table
at
the
corner
of
the
grove
where
the
afternoon
seemed
a
copley
and
marcia
had
taken
tea
one
of
the
soldiers
came
hastily
forward
permit
me
signorina
he
said
with
a
bow
taking
the
plate
from
her
hands
marcia
relinquished
it
with
a
and
a
friendly
smile
they
were
so
polite
so
these
italians
cups
were
brought
the
table
was
spread
and
marcia
poured
the
coffee
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
she
were
presiding
at
an
afternoon
reception
the
two
at
the
soldiers
invitation
stayed
and
shared
the
meal
with
them
marcia
never
forgot
that
sunrise
on
the
was
villa
vivalanti
s
last
social
function
she
watched
sybert
s
intercourse
with
these
men
with
something
like
amazement
feeling
that
she
had
still
to
know
him
that
his
character
was
in
the
end
the
mystery
it
had
seemed
with
his
hand
on
their
shoulders
he
was
chatting
to
the
group
as
if
he
had
known
them
all
his
life
cordial
friendly
intimate
with
an
air
of
of
perfect
comprehension
that
she
had
never
seen
him
employ
toward
even
his
staunchest
friends
of
the
embassy
one
of
the
soldiers
noticing
the
direction
of
her
glance
informed
her
that
the
signore
had
been
up
all
night
alternately
talking
to
them
and
pacing
the
walks
of
the
ilex
grove
and
he
added
that
the
signore
was
a
gentleman
and
a
good
fellow
what
did
he
talk
about
she
asked
many
many
things
said
the
man
italia
and
the
people
s
and
the
priests
and
the
wine
of
sicily
and
the
king
and
the
camorra
and
he
looked
a
trifle
conscious
our
sweethearts
he
is
not
like
other
the
signore
he
understands
he
is
a
good
and
then
the
young
was
most
her
about
his
own
sweetheart
her
name
was
lucia
and
she
lived
in
lucca
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
finish
his
service
and
then
they
would
be
married
and
keep
a
shop
in
florence
that
was
his
wood
to
sell
to
the
it
was
a
beautiful
trade
he
had
learned
it
in
switzerland
and
he
had
learned
it
well
the
signorina
should
judge
if
she
ever
came
to
florence
how
much
longer
did
he
have
to
serve
four
months
and
then
rolled
his
eyes
in
the
direction
where
lucca
might
be
supposed
to
lie
marcia
smiled
sympathetically
lucia
was
a
beautiful
name
she
said
was
it
not
a
beautiful
name
he
returned
in
an
ecstasy
but
the
signorina
should
see
lucia
herself
words
failed
him
at
this
point
santa
lucia
he
murmured
softly
and
he
hummed
the
tune
under
his
breath
marcia
unclasped
a
chain
of
gold
beads
from
her
neck
and
slipped
it
into
his
hand
when
you
go
back
to
lucca
give
this
to
lucia
from
here
here
what
is
this
said
sybert
in
english
coming
up
behind
do
i
find
you
giving
to
a
strange
young
man
marcia
flushed
guiltily
at
the
detection
it
s
for
a
friend
of
mine
in
lucca
she
said
nodding
over
her
shoulder
to
the
young
soldier
as
they
turned
back
toward
the
loggia
sybert
laughed
softly
what
are
you
laughing
at
she
asked
i
sent
a
wedding
present
to
lucia
they
strolled
to
the
end
of
the
loggia
and
stood
by
the
balustrade
looking
off
into
the
hills
the
fresh
dewy
scents
of
early
morning
were
in
the
air
and
all
the
world
seemed
beautiful
and
young
marcia
thought
of
sybert
pacing
up
and
down
the
dark
ilex
walks
while
the
villa
slept
and
of
the
dreadful
thing
he
had
spoken
last
night
in
that
wild
moment
of
despair
she
searched
his
face
questioningly
there
were
shadows
under
his
eyes
the
marks
of
last
night
s
vigil
but
in
his
eyes
a
steady
calm
he
caught
the
look
and
read
her
thoughts
that
s
all
over
marcia
he
said
quietly
i
ve
fought
it
out
you
mustn
t
think
of
it
again
i
don
t
very
often
lose
control
of
myself
but
i
did
last
night
once
in
years
he
smiled
a
man
ought
to
be
forgiven
for
being
a
little
will
be
happy
she
asked
marcia
america
is
for
me
as
for
so
many
poor
italians
the
promised
land
i
m
going
home
to
she
shook
her
head
sadly
t
be
it
s
all
i
have
and
it
s
all
i
want
there
s
not
room
in
my
heart
for
anything
but
you
don
t
say
that
she
cried
that
s
why
i
love
there
s
room
in
your
heart
for
so
many
other
people
america
is
your
own
country
let
it
take
the
place
of
he
studied
the
campagna
silent
a
moment
while
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
he
shook
his
head
slowly
and
looked
back
with
melancholy
eyes
i
don
t
know
marcia
that
may
come
just
now
you
can
t
understand
what
italy
means
to
me
i
was
born
here
i
learned
to
speak
the
language
before
i
did
english
all
that
other
men
feel
for
their
country
for
their
homes
i
feel
for
italy
and
these
poor
patient
ve
done
them
harm
instead
of
good
oh
i
see
the
truth
italy
must
do
for
herself
the
foreigners
can
t
help
and
i
m
a
foreigner
like
the
ah
laurence
she
pleaded
don
t
you
see
that
you
re
an
american
and
that
nothing
nothing
can
stamp
it
out
it
s
all
a
mistake
your
place
isn
t
s
at
home
every
man
can
surely
do
his
best
work
in
his
own
country
and
america
needs
good
men
do
you
remember
what
you
said
at
uncle
howard
s
dinner
that
last
night
we
were
in
rome
that
to
be
a
loyal
citizen
of
the
world
was
the
best
a
man
could
do
but
you
can
t
be
a
loyal
citizen
of
the
world
unless
you
are
first
of
all
a
loyal
citizen
of
your
own
country
america
may
be
crude
and
it
may
have
a
good
many
faults
but
it
s
our
country
just
the
same
and
we
ought
to
love
it
better
than
any
other
you
do
love
it
don
t
you
tell
me
you
do
tell
me
you
re
glad
that
you
re
an
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
with
glowing
eyes
and
cheeks
that
burned
as
he
watched
her
a
picture
flashed
over
him
of
what
it
meant
he
thought
of
the
vast
country
with
its
richness
its
possibilities
its
contrasts
he
thought
of
its
vitality
and
force
its
energy
and
nervousness
and
daring
and
for
a
brief
instant
he
felt
himself
a
part
of
it
a
sudden
wave
swept
over
him
of
that
strange
irrational
romantic
love
of
fatherland
which
is
fundamental
underneath
the
polish
underneath
the
wickedness
in
every
man
in
every
land
for
a
second
he
thrilled
with
it
too
and
then
as
his
eye
wandered
to
the
great
plain
beneath
them
the
old
first
back
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
with
sudden
tears
in
his
eyes
some
day
marcia
i
will
tell
you
that
i
m
proud
to
be
an
american
don
t
ask
me
just
and
as
they
stood
there
hand
in
hand
there
was
borne
to
them
from
the
above
the
sweet
prophetic
sound
of
the
bells
of
castel
vivalanti
ringing
the
angelus
while
below
them
on
the
horizon
like
a
great
sea
stretched
the
campagna
haunting
mysterious
roman
campagna
that
has
demanded
as
sacrifice
the
lives
of
so
many
miserable
peasants
that
has
lured
from
distant
homes
so
many
strangers
and
held
them
prisoners
to
its
beautiful
deadly
desolate
land
that
has
inspired
more
passionate
love
