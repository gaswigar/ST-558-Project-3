death
brings

linford
pratt
senior
clerk
to
eldrick
pascoe
solicitors
of
barford
a
young
man
who
earnestly
desired
to
get
on
in
life
by
hook
or
by
crook
with
no
objection
whatever
to
crookedness
so
long
as
it
could
be
performed
in
safety
and
secrecy
had
once
during
one
of
his
periodical
visits
to
the
town
reference
library
lighted
on
a
maxim
of
that
other
unscrupulous
person
prince
talleyrand
which
had
pleased
him
greatly
with
time
and
patience
said
talleyrand
the
mulberry
leaf
is
turned
into
satin
this
seemed
to
linford
pratt
one
of
the
finest
and
soundest
pieces
of
wisdom
which
he
had
ever
known
put
into
words
a
mulberry
leaf
is
a
very
insignificant
thing
but
a
piece
of
satin
is
a
highly
marketable
commodity
with
money
in
it
henceforth
he
regarded
himself
as
a
mulberry
leaf
which
his
own
wit
and
skill
must
transform
into
satin
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
there
is
another
thing
in
addition
to
time
and
patience
which
is
valuable
to
young
men
of
his
peculiar
qualities
a
thing
also
much
beloved
by
talleyrand
opportunity
he
could
find
the
patience
and
he
had
the
time
but
it
would
give
him
great
happiness
if
opportunity
came
along
to
help
in
the
work
in
everyday
language
linford
pratt
wanted
a
chance
he
waited
the
arrival
of
the
tide
in
his
affairs
which
would
lead
him
on
to
fortune
leave
him
alone
he
said
to
himself
to
be
sure
to
take
it
at
the
flood
if
pratt
had
only
known
it
as
he
stood
in
the
outer
office
of
eldrick
pascoe
at
the
end
of
a
certain
winter
afternoon
opportunity
was
slowly
climbing
the
staircase
outside
not
only
opportunity
but
temptation
both
assisted
by
the
devil
they
came
at
the
right
moment
for
pratt
was
alone
the
partners
had
gone
the
other
clerks
had
gone
the
had
gone
in
another
minute
pratt
would
have
gone
too
he
was
only
looking
round
before
locking
up
for
the
night
then
these
things
came
combined
in
the
person
of
an
old
man
antony
bartle
who
opened
the
door
pushed
in
a
queer
wrinkled
face
and
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
if
anybody
was
in
i
in
bartle
answered
pratt
turning
up
a
gas
jet
which
he
had
just
lowered
come
in
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
antony
bartle
came
in
wheezing
and
coughing
he
was
a
very
very
old
man
feeble
and
bent
with
little
that
looked
alive
about
him
but
his
light
alert
eyes
everybody
knew
him
he
was
one
of
the
institutions
of
barford
as
well
known
as
the
town
hall
or
the
parish
church
for
fifty
years
he
had
kept
a
bookshop
in
quagg
alley
the
narrow
which
connected
market
street
with
beck
street
it
was
not
by
any
means
a
common
or
ordinary
bookshop
its
proprietor
styled
himself
an
antiquarian
bookseller
and
he
had
a
reputation
in
two
continents
and
dealt
with
millionaire
buyers
and
virtuosos
in
both
barford
people
sometimes
marvelled
at
the
news
that
antony
bartle
had
given
two
thousand
guineas
for
a
book
of
hours
and
had
sold
a
missal
for
twice
that
amount
to
some
american
collector
and
they
got
a
hazy
notion
that
the
old
man
must
be
despite
his
snuffiness
and
shabbiness
and
that
his
queer
old
shop
in
the
window
of
which
there
was
rarely
anything
to
be
seen
but
a
few
ancient
tomes
and
two
or
three
rare
engravings
contained
much
that
he
could
turn
at
an
notice
into
gold
all
that
was
surmise
but
eldrick
pascoe
which
term
included
linford
pratt
knew
all
about
antony
bartle
being
his
solicitors
his
will
was
safely
deposited
in
their
keeping
and
pratt
had
been
one
of
the
attesting
witnesses
the
old
man
having
slowly
walked
into
the
outer
office
leaned
against
a
table
panting
a
little
pratt
hastened
to
open
an
inner
door
come
into
eldrick
room
bartle
he
said
there
a
nice
easy
chair
there
come
and
sit
down
in
it
those
stairs
are
a
bit
trying
are
they
i
often
wish
we
were
on
the
ground
floor
he
lighted
the
gas
in
the
senior
partner
room
and
turning
back
took
hold
of
the
visitor
arm
and
helped
him
to
the
easy
chair
then
having
closed
the
doors
he
sat
down
at
eldrick
desk
put
his
fingers
together
and
waited
pratt
knew
from
experience
that
old
antony
bartle
would
not
have
come
there
except
on
business
he
knew
also
having
been
at
eldrick
pascoe
for
many
years
that
the
old
man
would
confide
in
him
as
readily
as
in
either
of
his
principals
there
a
nasty
fog
coming
on
outside
said
bartle
after
a
fit
of
coughing
it
gets
on
my
lungs
and
then
it
makes
my
heart
bad
eldrick
in
gone
replied
pratt
all
gone
bartle
only
me
here
you
do
answered
the
old
bookseller
you
as
good
as
they
are
he
leaned
forward
from
the
easy
chair
and
tapped
the
clerk
arm
with
a
long
finger
i
say
he
continued
with
a
smile
that
was
something
between
a
wink
and
a
leer
and
suggestive
of
a
pleased
satisfaction
i
had
a
find
oh
responded
pratt
one
of
your
rare
books
bartle
got
something
for
twopence
that
you
sell
for
ten
guineas
you
one
of
the
lucky
ones
you
know
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
chuckled
bartle
and
i
had
to
pay
for
my
knowledge
young
man
before
i
got
it
we
all
have
no
but
i
found
something
not
half
an
hour
ago
came
straight
here
with
it
matters
for
lawyers
of
course
yes
said
pratt
inquiringly
and
what
may
it
be
he
was
expecting
the
visitor
to
produce
something
but
the
old
man
again
leaned
forward
and
dug
his
finger
once
more
into
the
clerk
sleeve
i
say
he
whispered
you
remember
john
mallathorpe
and
the
affair
of
how
long
is
it
since
two
years
answered
pratt
promptly
of
course
i
do
could
very
well
forget
it
or
him
he
let
his
mind
go
back
for
the
moment
to
an
affair
which
had
provided
barford
and
the
neighbourhood
with
a
nine
days
sensation
one
winter
morning
just
two
years
previously
john
mallathorpe
one
of
the
manufacturers
and
richest
men
of
the
town
had
been
killed
by
the
falling
of
his
own
the
condition
of
the
chimney
had
been
doubtful
for
some
little
time
experts
had
been
examining
it
for
several
days
at
the
moment
of
the
catastrophe
mallathorpe
himself
some
of
his
principal
managers
and
a
couple
of
professional
were
gathered
at
its
base
consulting
on
a
report
the
great
structure
above
them
had
collapsed
without
the
slightest
warning
mallathorpe
his
principal
manager
and
his
cashier
had
been
killed
on
the
spot
two
other
bystanders
had
subsequently
died
from
injuries
received
no
such
accident
had
occurred
in
barford
nor
in
the
surrounding
manufacturing
district
for
many
years
and
there
had
been
much
interest
in
it
for
according
to
the
expert
conclusions
the
chimney
was
in
no
immediate
danger
other
then
began
to
examine
their
chimneys
and
for
many
weeks
barford
folk
had
talked
of
little
else
than
the
danger
of
living
in
the
shadows
of
these
great
masses
of
masonry
but
there
had
soon
been
something
else
to
talk
of
it
sprang
out
of
the
accident
and
it
was
of
particular
interest
to
persons
who
like
linford
pratt
were
of
the
legal
profession
john
mallathorpe
so
far
as
anybody
knew
or
could
ascertain
had
died
intestate
no
solicitor
in
the
town
had
ever
made
a
will
for
him
no
solicitor
elsewhere
had
ever
made
a
will
for
him
no
one
had
ever
heard
that
he
had
made
a
will
for
himself
there
was
no
will
drastic
search
of
his
safes
his
desks
his
drawers
revealed
nothing
not
even
a
memorandum
no
friend
of
his
had
ever
heard
him
mention
a
will
he
had
always
been
something
of
a
queer
man
he
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
the
only
relation
he
had
in
the
world
was
his
the
widow
of
his
deceased
younger
brother
and
her
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
and
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
died
intestate
they
put
in
their
claim
to
his
property
john
mallathorpe
had
left
a
handsome
property
he
had
been
making
money
all
his
life
his
business
was
a
considerable
one
he
employed
two
thousand
workpeople
his
average
annual
profit
from
his
mills
was
reckoned
in
thousands
four
or
five
thousands
at
least
and
some
years
before
his
death
he
had
bought
one
of
the
finest
estates
in
the
neighbourhood
normandale
grange
a
beautiful
old
house
set
amidst
charming
and
romantic
scenery
in
a
valley
which
though
within
twelve
miles
of
barford
might
have
been
in
the
heart
of
the
highlands
therefore
it
was
no
small
thing
that
richard
mallathorpe
and
her
two
children
laid
claim
to
up
to
the
time
of
john
mallathorpe
death
they
had
lived
in
very
humble
fashion
lived
indeed
on
an
allowance
from
their
kinsman
for
richard
mallathorpe
had
been
as
much
of
a
waster
as
his
brother
had
been
of
a
and
there
was
no
withstanding
their
claim
when
it
was
finally
decided
that
john
mallathorpe
had
died
intestate
no
withstanding
that
at
any
rate
of
the
nephew
and
niece
the
nephew
had
taken
all
the
real
estate
he
and
his
sister
had
shared
the
personal
property
and
for
some
months
they
and
their
mother
had
been
safely
installed
at
normandale
grange
and
in
full
possession
of
the
dead
man
wealth
and
business
all
this
flashed
through
linford
pratt
mind
in
a
few
seconds
he
knew
all
the
story
he
had
often
thought
of
the
extraordinary
good
fortune
of
those
young
people
to
be
living
on
charity
one
week
and
the
next
to
be
legal
possessors
of
thousands
a
year
oh
if
only
such
luck
would
come
his
way
of
course
he
repeated
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
old
bookseller
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
forget
in
a
hurry
bartle
what
of
it
antony
bartle
leaned
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
chuckled
something
some
idea
seemed
to
be
affording
him
amusement
i
eighty
years
old
he
remarked
no
i
more
to
be
exact
i
shall
be
come
february
when
you
lived
as
long
as
that
young
pratt
you
know
that
this
life
is
a
game
of
to
some
folks
at
any
rate
just
so
you
did
come
here
to
tell
me
that
bartle
said
pratt
he
was
an
essentially
practical
young
man
who
dined
at
six
every
evening
having
lunched
on
no
more
than
and
a
glass
of
ale
and
he
also
had
his
evenings
well
mapped
out
i
know
that
already
sir
aye
aye
but
you
know
more
of
it
later
on
replied
bartle
well
you
know
too
no
doubt
that
the
late
john
mallathorpe
was
a
bit
only
a
bit
of
a
collected
books
and
pamphlets
relating
to
this
district
i
heard
of
it
answered
the
clerk
he
had
that
collection
in
his
private
room
at
the
mill
continued
the
old
bookseller
and
when
the
new
folks
took
hold
i
persuaded
them
to
sell
it
to
me
there
was
such
a
lot
maybe
a
hundred
volumes
altogether
but
i
wanted
what
there
was
and
as
they
were
of
no
interest
to
them
they
sold
that
some
months
ago
i
put
all
the
books
in
a
corner
and
i
never
really
examined
them
until
this
very
afternoon
then
by
this
afternoon
post
i
got
a
letter
from
a
barford
man
now
out
in
america
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
supply
him
with
a
nice
copy
of
hopkinson
of
i
knew
there
was
one
in
that
mallathorpe
collection
so
i
got
it
out
and
examined
it
and
in
the
pocket
inside
in
which
there
a
map
i
found
what
d
think
could
say
replied
pratt
he
was
still
thinking
of
his
dinner
and
of
an
important
engagement
to
follow
it
and
he
had
not
the
least
idea
that
old
antony
bartle
was
going
to
tell
him
anything
very
important
letters
something
of
that
sort
the
old
bookseller
leaned
nearer
across
the
corner
of
the
desk
until
his
queer
wrinkled
face
was
almost
close
to
pratt
sharp
youthful
one
again
he
lifted
the
finger
again
he
tapped
the
arm
i
found
john
mallathorpe
will
he
whispered
his
will
linford
pratt
jumped
out
of
his
chair
for
a
second
he
stared
in
speechless
amazement
at
the
old
man
then
he
plunged
his
hands
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
a
sudden
exclamation
no
he
said
no
john
mallathorpe
will
his
will
made
the
very
day
on
which
he
died
answered
bartle
nodding
emphatically
queer
was
it
he
might
have
had
some
premonition
eh
pratt
sat
down
again
where
is
it
he
asked
here
in
my
pocket
replied
the
old
bookseller
tapping
his
rusty
coat
oh
it
all
right
i
assure
you
all
duly
made
out
signed
and
witnessed
everything
in
order
i
know
because
a
long
a
very
long
time
ago
i
was
like
you
an
attorney
clerk
i
drafted
many
a
will
and
witnessed
many
a
will
in
my
time
i
read
this
every
word
of
it
it
all
right
nothing
can
upset
it
let
see
it
said
pratt
eagerly
well
i
no
objection
i
know
you
of
course
answered
bartle
but
i
rather
show
it
first
to
eldrick
could
you
telephone
up
to
his
house
and
ask
him
to
run
back
here
certainly
replied
pratt
he
may
be
there
though
but
i
can
try
you
have
shown
it
to
anybody
else
neither
shown
it
to
anybody
nor
mentioned
it
to
a
soul
said
bartle
i
tell
you
it
not
much
more
than
half
an
hour
since
i
found
it
not
a
long
document
do
you
know
how
it
is
that
it
never
come
out
he
went
on
turning
eagerly
to
pratt
who
had
risen
again
it
easily
explained
the
will
witnessed
by
those
two
men
who
were
killed
at
the
same
time
as
john
mallathorpe
so
of
course
there
was
nobody
to
say
that
it
was
in
evidence
my
notion
is
that
he
and
those
two
men
gaukrodger
and
marshall
his
manager
and
cashier
had
signed
it
not
long
before
the
accident
and
that
mallathorpe
had
popped
it
into
the
pocket
of
that
book
before
going
out
into
the
yard
eh
but
see
if
you
can
get
eldrick
down
here
and
we
read
it
together
and
i
say
this
office
seems
uncommonly
stuffy
can
you
open
the
window
a
bit
or
something
i
feel
oppressed
like
pratt
opened
a
window
which
looked
out
on
the
street
he
glanced
at
the
old
man
for
a
moment
and
saw
that
his
face
always
pallid
was
even
paler
than
usual
you
been
talking
too
much
he
said
rest
yourself
bartle
while
i
ring
up
eldrick
house
if
he
is
there
i
try
his
club
he
often
turns
in
there
for
an
hour
before
going
home
he
went
out
by
a
private
door
to
the
telephone
box
which
stood
in
a
lobby
used
by
various
occupants
of
the
building
and
when
he
had
rung
up
eldrick
private
house
and
was
waiting
for
the
answer
he
asked
himself
what
this
discovery
would
mean
to
the
present
holders
of
the
mallathorpe
property
and
his
curiosity
a
strongly
developed
quality
in
him
became
more
and
more
excited
if
eldrick
was
not
at
home
if
he
could
not
get
in
touch
with
him
he
would
persuade
old
bartle
to
let
him
see
his
find
he
would
cheerfully
go
late
to
his
dinner
if
he
could
only
get
a
peep
at
this
strangely
discovered
document
romance
why
this
indeed
was
romance
and
it
might
be
what
else
old
bartle
had
already
chuckled
about
did
that
mean
that
the
telephone
bell
rang
eldrick
had
not
yet
reached
his
house
pratt
got
on
to
the
club
eldrick
had
not
been
there
he
rang
off
and
went
back
to
the
private
room
ca
get
hold
of
him
bartle
he
began
as
he
closed
the
door
he
not
at
home
and
he
not
at
the
club
i
say
you
might
as
well
let
me
have
a
look
at
pratt
suddenly
stopped
there
was
a
strange
silence
in
the
room
the
old
man
wheezy
breathing
was
no
longer
heard
and
the
clerk
moved
forward
quickly
and
looked
round
the
high
back
of
the
easy
chair
he
knew
at
once
what
had
happened
knew
that
old
bartle
was
dead
before
he
laid
a
finger
on
the
wasted
hand
which
had
dropped
helplessly
at
his
side
he
had
evidently
died
without
a
sound
or
a
movement
died
as
quietly
as
he
would
have
gone
to
sleep
indeed
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
laid
his
old
head
against
the
padding
of
the
chair
and
dropped
asleep
and
pratt
who
had
seen
death
before
knew
that
he
would
never
wake
again
he
waited
a
moment
listening
in
the
silence
once
he
touched
the
old
man
hand
once
he
bent
nearer
still
listening
and
then
without
hesitation
and
with
fingers
that
remained
as
steady
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
unbuttoned
antony
bartle
coat
and
drew
a
folded
paper
from
the
inner
pocket
chapter
ii
in
trust
as
quietly
and
composedly
as
if
he
were
discharging
the
most
ordinary
of
his
daily
duties
pratt
unfolded
the
document
and
went
close
to
the
solitary
gas
jet
above
eldrick
desk
what
he
held
in
his
hand
was
a
of
ruled
foolscap
paper
closely
covered
with
writing
which
he
at
once
recognized
as
that
of
the
late
john
mallathorpe
he
was
familiar
with
that
writing
he
had
often
seen
it
it
was
an
writing
clear
distinct
with
every
letter
well
and
fully
formed
made
it
himself
muttered
pratt
um
looks
as
if
he
wanted
to
keep
the
terms
secret
well
he
read
the
will
through
rapidly
but
with
care
murmuring
the
phraseology
half
aloud

the
last

barford

as
the
last

left
his
lips
pratt
carefully
folded
up
the
will
slipped
it
into
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
firmly
buttoned
the
coat
across
his
chest
then
without
as
much
as
a
glance
at
the
dead
man
he
left
the
room
and
again
visited
the
telephone
box
he
was
engaged
in
it
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
out
he
heard
steps
coming
up
the
staircase
and
looking
over
the
banisters
he
saw
the
senior
partner
eldrick
a
man
eldrick
looked
up
and
saw
pratt
i
hear
you
been
ringing
me
up
at
the
club
pratt
he
said
what
is
it
pratt
waited
until
eldrick
had
come
up
to
the
landing
then
he
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
private
room
and
shook
his
head
it
old
bartle
sir
he
whispered
he
in
your
room
there
dead
dead
exclaimed
eldrick
dead
pratt
shook
his
head
again
he
came
up
not
so
long
after
you
gone
sir
he
said
everybody
had
gone
but
me
i
was
just
going
wanted
to
see
you
about
something
i
know
what
he
was
very
tottery
when
he
came
in
complained
of
the
stairs
and
the
fog
i
took
him
into
your
room
to
sit
down
in
the
easy
chair
and
he
died
straight
off
just
concluded
pratt
just
as
if
he
was
going
quietly
to
sleep
you
sure
he
is
dead
not
fainting
asked
eldrick
he
dead
sir
quite
dead
replied
pratt
i
rung
up
melrose
he
be
here
in
a
minute
or
two
and
the
town
hall
the
police
as
well
will
you
look
at
him
sir
eldrick
silently
motioned
his
clerk
to
open
the
door
together
they
walked
into
the
room
and
eldrick
looked
at
his
quiet
figure
and
wan
face
and
knew
that
pratt
was
right
poor
old
chap
he
murmured
touching
one
of
the
thin
hands
he
was
a
fine
man
in
his
time
pratt
clever
man
and
he
was
very
very
old
one
of
the
oldest
men
in
barford
well
we
must
wire
to
his
grandson
bartle
collingwood
you
find
his
address
in
the
book
he
the
only
relation
the
old
fellow
had
come
in
for
everything
does
he
sir
asked
pratt
as
he
took
an
address
book
from
the
desk
and
picked
up
a
sheaf
of
telegram
forms
every
penny
murmured
eldrick
nice
little
fortune
too
a
fine
thing
for
a
young
fellow
who
just
been
called
to
the
bar
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
be
fairly
well
independent
even
if
he
never
sees
a
brief
in
his
life
he
has
been
called
has
he
sir
asked
pratt
laying
a
telegram
form
on
eldrick
writing
pad
and
handing
him
a
pen
i
was
aware
of
that
called
this
term
quite
recently
at
gray
inn
replied
eldrick
as
he
sat
down
very
promising
clever
young
man
look
here
we
better
send
two
wires
one
to
his
private
address
and
one
to
his
chambers
they
both
in
that
book
it
six
is
it
he
might
be
at
his
chambers
yet
but
he
may
have
gone
home
i
write
both
messages
you
put
the
addresses
on
and
get
the
wire
off
we
must
have
him
down
here
as
soon
as
possible
one
address
is
pump
court
the
other
cloburn
square
remarked
pratt
consulting
the
book
there
an
express
from
cross
at
which
gets
here
midnight
oh
it
would
do
if
he
came
down
first
thing
in
the
morning
leave
it
to
him
said
eldrick
i
say
pratt
do
you
think
an
inquest
will
be
necessary
pratt
had
not
thought
of
that
he
began
to
think
and
while
he
was
thinking
the
doctor
whom
he
had
summoned
came
in
he
looked
at
the
dead
man
asked
the
clerk
a
few
questions
and
was
apparently
satisfied
i
do
think
there
any
need
for
an
inquest
he
said
in
reply
to
eldrick
i
knew
the
old
man
very
well
he
was
much
feebler
than
he
would
admit
the
exertion
of
coming
up
these
stairs
of
yours
and
the
coughing
brought
on
by
the
fog
outside
that
was
quite
enough
of
course
the
death
will
have
to
be
reported
in
the
usual
way
but
i
have
no
hesitation
in
giving
a
certificate
you
let
the
town
hall
people
know
well
the
body
had
better
be
removed
to
his
rooms
we
must
send
over
and
tell
his
housekeeper
he
no
relations
in
the
town
had
he
only
one
in
the
world
that
he
ever
mentioned
his
grandson
a
young
barrister
in
london
answered
eldrick
we
just
been
wiring
to
him
here
pratt
you
take
these
messages
now
and
get
them
off
then
see
about
making
all
arrangements
he
added
as
pratt
moved
towards
the
door
you
do
know
what
what
he
came
to
see
me
about
have
the
remotest
idea
sir
answered
pratt
readily
and
glibly
he
died
just
as
i
told
you
before
he
could
tell
me
anything
he
went
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
and
away
to
the
general
post
office
only
conscious
of
one
thing
only
concerned
about
one
thing
that
he
was
now
the
sole
possessor
of
a
great
secret
the
opportunity
which
he
had
so
often
longed
for
had
come
and
as
he
hurried
along
through
the
gathering
fog
he
repeated
and
repeated
a
fragment
of
the
recent
conversation
between
the
man
who
was
now
dead
and
himself
who
remained
very
much
alive
you
have
shown
it
to
anybody
else
pratt
had
asked
neither
shown
it
to
anybody
nor
mentioned
it
to
a
soul
antony
bartle
had
answered
so
in
all
that
great
town
of
barford
he
linford
pratt
he
alone
out
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
knew
what
the
magnitude
of
what
he
knew
not
only
amazed
but
exhilarated
him
there
were
such
possibilities
for
himself
in
that
knowledge
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
out
those
possibilities
to
reckon
up
what
they
came
to
of
one
thing
he
was
already
certain
they
should
be
must
be
turned
to
his
own
advantage
it
was
past
eight
before
pratt
was
able
to
go
home
to
his
lodgings
his
landlady
meeting
him
in
the
hall
hoped
that
his
dinner
would
not
be
spoiled
pratt
who
relied
greatly
on
his
dinner
as
his
one
great
meal
of
the
day
replied
that
he
fervently
hoped
it
was
but
that
if
it
was
it
could
be
helped
this
time
for
once
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
than
his
dinner
as
for
his
engagement
for
that
evening
he
had
already
thrown
it
over
he
wanted
to
give
all
his
energies
and
thoughts
and
time
to
his
secret
nevertheless
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
washed
changed
his
clothes
ate
his
dinner
and
even
glanced
over
the
evening
newspaper
before
he
turned
to
the
real
business
which
was
already
deep
in
his
brain
but
at
last
when
the
maid
had
cleared
away
the
dinner
things
and
he
was
alone
in
his
and
had
lighted
his
pipe
and
mixed
himself
a
drop
of
the
only
indulgence
in
such
things
that
he
allowed
himself
within
the
hours
he
drew
john
mallathorpe
will
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
carefully
three
times
and
then
he
began
to
think
closely
and
steadily
first
of
all
the
will
was
a
good
will
nothing
could
upset
it
it
was
absolutely
valid
it
was
not
couched
in
the
terms
which
a
solicitor
would
have
employed
but
it
clearly
and
plainly
expressed
john
mallathorpe
intentions
and
meanings
in
respect
to
the
disposal
of
his
property
nothing
could
be
clearer
the
properly
appointed
trustees
were
to
realize
his
estate
they
were
to
distribute
it
according
to
his
specified
instructions
it
was
all
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
pratt
who
was
a
good
lawyer
knew
what
the
probate
court
would
say
to
that
will
if
it
were
ever
brought
up
before
it
as
he
did
a
quite
satisfactory
will
and
it
was
validly
executed
hundreds
of
people
competent
to
do
so
could
swear
to
john
mallathorpe
signature
hundreds
to
gaukrodger
thousands
to
marshall
who
as
cashier
was
always
sending
his
signature
broadcast
no
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
put
that
into
the
hands
of
the
trustees
named
in
it
and
then
pratt
thought
next
of
the
two
trustees
they
were
men
in
the
town
they
were
comparatively
young
men
about
forty
they
were
men
of
great
energy
their
chief
interests
were
in
educational
matters
that
no
doubt
was
why
john
mallathorpe
had
appointed
them
trustees
wyatt
had
been
plaguing
the
town
for
two
years
to
start
commercial
schools
charlesworth
was
a
devoted
champion
of
technical
schools
pratt
knew
how
the
hearts
of
both
would
leap
if
he
suddenly
told
them
that
enormous
funds
were
at
their
disposal
for
the
furtherance
of
their
schemes
and
he
also
knew
something
else
that
neither
charlesworth
nor
wyatt
had
the
faintest
remotest
notion
or
suspicion
that
john
mallathorpe
had
ever
made
such
a
will
or
they
would
have
moved
heaven
and
earth
pulled
down
normandale
grange
and
mallathorpe
mill
in
their
efforts
to
find
it
but
the
effect
the
effect
of
producing
the
will
now
pratt
like
everybody
else
had
been
deeply
interested
in
the
mallathorpe
affair
there
was
so
little
doubt
that
john
mallathorpe
had
died
intestate
such
absolute
certainty
that
his
only
living
relations
were
his
deceased
brother
two
children
and
their
mother
that
the
necessary
proceedings
for
putting
harper
mallathorpe
and
his
sister
nesta
in
possession
of
the
property
real
and
personal
had
been
comparatively
simple
and
speedy
but
what
was
it
worth
what
would
the
two
trustees
have
been
able
to
hand
over
to
the
mayor
and
corporation
of
barford
if
the
will
had
been
found
as
soon
as
john
mallathorpe
died
pratt
from
what
he
remembered
of
the
bulk
and
calculations
at
the
time
made
a
rapid
estimate
as
near
as
he
could
reckon
the
mayor
and
corporation
would
have
got
about
that
then
and
this
was
what
he
wanted
to
get
at
was
what
these
young
people
would
lose
if
he
produced
the
will
nay
on
second
thoughts
it
would
be
much
more
very
much
more
in
some
time
for
the
manufacturing
business
was
being
carried
on
by
them
and
was
apparently
doing
as
well
as
ever
it
was
really
an
enormous
amount
which
they
would
lose
and
they
would
get
what
ten
thousand
apiece
and
their
mother
a
like
sum
thirty
thousand
pounds
in
all
in
comparison
with
hundreds
of
thousands
but
they
would
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
nothing
could
upset
that
will
he
began
to
think
of
the
three
people
whom
the
production
of
this
will
would
dispossess
he
knew
little
of
them
beyond
what
common
gossip
had
related
at
the
time
of
john
mallathorpe
sudden
death
they
had
lived
in
very
quiet
fashion
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
until
this
change
in
their
fortunes
once
or
twice
pratt
had
seen
mallathorpe
in
her
carriage
in
the
barford
streets
somebody
had
pointed
her
out
to
him
and
had
observed
sneeringly
that
folk
can
soon
adapt
themselves
to
circumstances
and
that
mallathorpe
now
gave
herself
all
the
airs
of
a
duchess
though
she
had
been
no
more
than
a
hospital
nurse
before
she
married
richard
mallathorpe
and
pratt
had
also
seen
young
harper
mallathorpe
now
and
then
in
the
town
since
the
good
fortune
arrived
and
had
envied
him
he
had
also
thought
what
a
strange
thing
it
was
that
money
went
to
young
fellows
who
seemed
to
have
no
particular
endowments
of
brain
or
energy
harper
was
a
very
ordinary
young
man
not
over
intelligent
in
appearance
who
pratt
had
heard
was
often
seen
lounging
about
the
one
or
two
fashionable
hotels
of
the
place
as
for
the
daughter
pratt
did
not
remember
having
ever
set
eyes
on
her
but
he
had
heard
that
up
to
the
time
of
john
mallathorpe
death
she
had
earned
her
own
living
as
a
governess
or
a
nurse
or
something
of
that
sort
he
turned
from
thinking
of
these
three
people
to
thoughts
about
himself
pratt
often
thought
about
himself
and
always
in
one
direction
the
direction
of
he
was
always
wanting
to
get
on
he
had
nobody
to
help
him
he
had
kept
himself
since
he
was
seventeen
his
father
and
mother
were
dead
he
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
the
only
relations
he
had
uncles
and
aunts
lived
some
in
london
some
in
canada
he
was
now
and
earning
four
pounds
a
week
he
had
immense
confidence
in
himself
but
he
had
never
seen
much
chance
of
escaping
from
drudgery
he
had
often
thought
of
asking
eldrick
pascoe
to
give
him
his
articles
but
he
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
his
request
would
be
refused
no
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
of
a
rut
and
yet
he
was
a
clever
fellow
a
fellow
a
sharp
shrewd
able
and
here
was
a
chance
such
a
chance
as
scarcely
ever
comes
to
a
man
he
would
be
a
fool
if
he
did
not
take
it
and
use
it
to
his
own
best
and
lasting
advantage
and
so
he
locked
up
the
will
in
a
safe
place
and
went
to
bed
resolved
to
take
a
bold
step
towards
fortune
on
the
morrow
chapter
iii
the
when
pratt
arrived
at
eldrick
pascoe
office
at
his
usual
hour
of
nine
next
morning
he
found
the
senior
partner
already
there
and
with
him
was
a
young
man
whom
the
clerk
at
once
set
down
as
bartle
collingwood
and
looked
at
with
considerable
interest
and
curiosity
he
had
often
heard
of
bartle
collingwood
but
had
never
seen
him
he
knew
that
he
was
the
only
son
of
old
antony
bartle
only
child
a
daughter
who
had
married
a
london
man
he
knew
too
that
parents
were
both
dead
and
that
the
old
bookseller
had
left
their
son
everything
he
possessed
a
very
nice
little
fortune
as
eldrick
had
observed
last
night
and
since
last
night
he
had
known
that
collingwood
had
just
been
called
to
the
bar
and
was
on
the
threshold
of
what
eldrick
who
evidently
knew
all
about
it
believed
to
be
a
promising
career
well
there
he
was
in
the
flesh
and
pratt
who
was
a
born
observer
of
men
and
events
took
a
good
look
at
him
as
he
stood
just
within
the
private
room
talking
to
eldrick
a
fellow
what
most
folk
would
call
handsome
dark
tall
with
a
certain
air
of
reserve
about
his
features
firm
lips
and
steady
eyes
that
suggested
strength
and
determination
he
would
look
very
well
in
wig
and
gown
decided
pratt
viewing
matters
from
a
professional
standpoint
he
was
just
the
sort
that
clients
would
feel
a
natural
confidence
in
and
that
juries
would
listen
to
another
of
the
lucky
ones
too
for
pratt
knew
the
contents
of
antony
bartle
will
and
that
the
young
man
at
whom
he
was
looking
had
succeeded
to
a
cool
thousand
pounds
at
least
through
his
grandfather
death
here
is
pratt
said
eldrick
glancing
into
the
outer
office
as
the
clerk
entered
it
pratt
come
in
here
here
is
bartle
collingwood
he
would
like
you
to
tell
him
the
facts
about
bartle
death
pratt
walked
in
armed
and
prepared
he
was
a
clever
hand
at
foreseeing
things
and
he
had
known
all
along
that
he
would
have
to
answer
questions
about
the
event
of
the
previous
night
there
very
little
to
tell
sir
he
said
with
a
polite
acknowledgment
of
collingwood
greeting
bartle
came
up
here
just
as
i
was
leaving
everybody
else
had
left
he
wanted
to
see
eldrick
why
he
did
say
he
was
coughing
a
good
deal
when
he
came
in
and
he
complained
of
the
fog
outside
and
of
the
stairs
he
said
something
just
a
mere
mention
about
his
heart
being
bad
i
lighted
the
gas
in
here
and
helped
him
into
the
chair
he
just
sat
down
laid
his
head
back
and
died
without
saying
anything
further
asked
collingwood
not
a
word
more
collingwood
answered
pratt
he
well
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
of
course
at
first
i
thought
he
fainted
but
i
soon
saw
what
it
was
it
so
happens
that
i
seen
a
death
just
as
sudden
as
that
once
before
my
landlady
husband
died
in
a
very
similar
fashion
in
my
presence
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
collingwood
except
ring
up
eldrick
and
the
doctor
and
the
police
pratt
made
himself
very
useful
last
night
in
making
arrangements
remarked
eldrick
looking
at
collingwood
as
it
is
there
is
very
little
to
do
there
will
be
no
need
for
any
inquest
melrose
has
given
his
certificate
so
there
are
only
the
funeral
arrangements
we
can
help
you
with
that
matter
of
course
but
first
you
no
doubt
like
to
go
to
your
grandfather
place
and
look
through
his
papers
we
have
his
will
here
you
know
and
i
already
told
you
its
effect
i
much
obliged
to
you
pratt
said
collingwood
turning
to
the
clerk
he
turned
again
to
eldrick
all
right
he
went
on
i
go
over
to
quagg
alley
pratt
my
grandfather
did
tell
you
anything
of
the
reason
of
his
call
here
not
a
word
sir
replied
pratt
merely
said
he
wanted
mr
eldrick
had
he
any
legal
business
in
process
asked
collingwood
eldrick
and
his
clerk
both
shook
their
heads
no
bartle
had
no
business
of
that
sort
that
they
knew
of
nothing
but
there
again
pratt
was
prepared
it
might
have
been
about
the
lease
of
that
property
in
horsebridge
land
sir
he
said
glancing
at
his
principal
he
did
mention
that
you
know
when
he
was
in
here
a
few
weeks
ago
just
so
agreed
eldrick
well
you
let
me
know
if
we
can
be
of
use
he
went
on
as
collingwood
turned
away
pratt
can
be
at
your
disposal
any
time
collingwood
thanked
him
and
went
off
he
had
travelled
down
from
london
by
the
earliest
morning
train
and
leaving
his
portmanteau
at
the
hotel
of
the
barford
terminus
had
gone
straight
to
eldrick
pascoe
office
accordingly
this
was
his
first
visit
to
the
shop
in
quagg
alley
but
he
knew
the
shop
and
its
surroundings
well
enough
though
he
had
not
been
in
barford
for
some
time
he
also
knew
antony
bartle
old
housekeeper
clough
a
rough
and
ready
yorkshirewoman
who
had
looked
after
the
old
man
as
long
as
he
collingwood
could
remember
she
received
him
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
merely
stepped
across
the
street
to
inquire
after
his
grandfather
health
i
thowt

highly
pleasing
to
their
narrator
and
went
up
to
look
at
his
dead
grandfather
he
had
never
seen
much
of
him
but
they
had
kept
up
a
regular
correspondence
and
always
been
on
terms
of
affection
and
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
been
with
the
old
man
at
the
last
he
remained
looking
at
the
queer
quiet
old
face
for
a
while
when
he
went
down
again

talking
to
a
lad
of
apparently
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
who
stood
at
the
door
leading
into
the
shop
and
who
glanced
at

with
keen
interest
and
speculation

shop

by
the
boy
and
closed
the
door
the
outer
door
into
quagg
alley
was
locked
a
light
blind

drawn
over
the
one
window

shelves
and
in
the
presses

down
in
his
grandfather
chair
at
a
big
table
piled
high
with
books
and
papers
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
did
my
grandfather
seem
at
all
unwell
when
he
went

coughing
a
bit
more
than

said

bothered
him
what
had
he
been
doing
during
the
afternoon
anything
particular
nothing
at
all
particular
before
four
or
so
sir
collingwood
took
a
closer
look
at
jabez
naylor
he
saw
that
he
was
an
observant
lad
evidently
of
superior
intelligence
a
good
specimen
of
the
sharp
town
lad
well
trained
in
a
modern
elementary
school
oh
he
said
nothing
particular
before
four
eh
did
he
do
something
particular
after
four
there
was
a
post
came
in
just
about
then
sir
answered
jabey
there
was
an
american
letter
that
it
sir
just
in
front
of
you
bartle
read
it
and
asked
me
if
we
got
a
good
clear
copy
of
of
i
reminded
him
that
there
was
a
copy
amongst
the
books
that
had
been
bought
from
mallathorpe
mill
some
time
ago
books
that
had
belonged
to
john
mallathorpe
who
was
killed

collingwood
who
was
fully
acquainted
with
the
chimney
accident
yes

bartle
bought
a
lot
of
books
that
mallathorpe
had
at
the
mill
local
books
they
there
in
that
corner
they
were
put
there
when
i
fetched
them
and
he
never
looked
over
them
since
particularly
well
and
this
of
you
reminded
him
of
it
i
got
it
out
for
him
sir
he
sat
down
where
you
sitting
and
began
to
examine
it
he
said
something
about
it
being
a
nice
copy
and
get
it
off
that
night
that
it
sir
i
did
read
it
of
course
and
then
he
took
some
papers
out
of
a
pocket
that
inside
it
and
i
heard
him
say
my
soul
who
have
thought
it
collingwood
picked
up
the
book
which
the
boy
indicated
a
thick
substantially
bound
volume
inside
one
cover
of
which
was
a
linen
pocket
wherein
were
some
loose
maps
and
plans
of
barford
these
what
he
took
out
he
asked
holding
them
up
yes
sir
but
there
was
another
paper
with
writing
on
it
a
biggish
sheet
of
paper
written
all
over
did
you
see
what
the
writing
was
did
you
see
any
of
it
no
sir
only
that
it
was
writing
i
was
dusting
those
shelves
out
over
there
when
i
heard
bartle
say
what
he
did
i
just
looked
round
over
my
shoulder
that
was
all

he
reading
this
paper
that
you
speak
of
yes
sir
he
was
holding
it
up
to
the
gas

any
more

any
remark
no

wrote
a
letter

at
once

he
sent
me
to
post

at
the
end
of
the
alley

you
read
the
address
the
lad
turned
to
a
book
which
stood
with
others
in
a
rack
over
the
and
tapped
it
with
his
finger
yes

me

ten
minutes
past

had
gone
collingwood
locked
up
the
shop
from
the
house
side
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
went
into
the
kitchen
clough
he
said
i
want
to
see
the
clothes
which
my
grandfather
was
wearing
when
he
was
brought
home
last
night
where
are
they
they
in
that
little
room
aside
of
his
mestur
collingwood
replied
the
housekeeper
i
laid
all
there
on
the
just
as
they
were
taken
off
of
him
by
lawyer
orders
he
said
they
had
been
examined
and
was
to
be
till
you
came
nobody
whatever
touched
since
collingwood
went
upstairs
and
into
the
little
room
a
sort
of
opening
out
of
that
in
which
the
old
man
lay
there
were
the
clothes
he
went
through
the
pockets
of
every
garment
he
found
such
things
as
keys
a
purse
loose
money
a
memorandum
book
a
bookseller
catalogue
or
two
two
or
three
letters
of
a
business
sort
but
there
was
no
big
folded
paper
covered
with
writing
such
as
jabey
naylor
had
described
the
mention
of
that
paper
had
excited
collingwood
curiosity
he
rapidly
summed
up
what
he
had
learned
his
grandfather
had
found
a
paper
closely
written
upon
in
a
book
which
had
been
the
property
of
john
mallathorpe
deceased
the
discovery
had
surprised
him
for
he
had
given
voice
to
an
exclamation
of
what
was
evidently
astonishment
he
had
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
then
he
had
written
a
letter
to
mallathorpe
of
normandale
grange
when
his
had
posted
that
letter
he
himself
had
gone
out
to
his
solicitor
what
asked
collingwood
was
the
reasonable
presumption
the
old
man
had
gone
to
eldrick
to
show
him
the
paper
which
he
had
found
he
lingered
in
the
little
room
for
a
few
minutes
thinking
no
one
but
pratt
had
been
with
antony
bartle
at
the
time
of
his
seizure
and
sudden
death
what
sort
of
a
fellow
was
pratt
was
he
honest
was
his
word
to
be
trusted
had
he
told
the
precise
truth
about
the
old
man
death
he
was
evidently
a
suave
polite
obliging
sort
of
fellow
this
clerk
but
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
if
antony
bartle
had
that
paper
whatever
it
was
in
his
pocket
when
he
went
to
eldrick
office
it
should
not
be
in
his
pocket
still
if
his
clothing
had
really
remained
untouched
already
suspicion
was
in
collingwood
mind
vague
and
indefinable
but
there
he
was
half
inclined
to
go
straight
back
to
eldrick
pascoe
and
tell
eldrick
what
jabey
naylor
had
just
told
him
but
he
reflected
that
while
naylor
went
out
to
post
the
letter
the
old
bookseller
might
have
put
the
paper
elsewhere
locked
it
up
in
his
safe
perhaps
one
thing
however
he
collingwood
could
do
at
once
he
could
ask
mallathorpe
if
the
letter
referred
to
the
paper
he
was
fully
acquainted
with
all
the
facts
of
the
mallathorpe
history
old
bartle
knowing
they
would
interest
his
grandson
had
sent
him
the
local
newspaper
accounts
of
its
various
episodes
it
was
only
twelve
miles
to
normandale
grange
a
would
carry
him
there
within
the
hour
he
glanced
at
his
watch
just
ten
o
an
hour
later
collingwood
found
himself
standing
in
a
fine
room
the
windows
of
which
looked
out
on
a
romantic
valley
whose
thickly
wooded
sides
were
still
bright
with
the
red
and
yellow
tints
of
autumn
a
door
opened
he
turned
expecting
to
see
mallathorpe
instead
he
found
himself
looking
at
a
girl
who
glanced
inquiringly
at
him
and
from
him
to
the
card
which
he
had
sent
in
on
his
arrival
chapter
iv
the
fortunate
possessors
collingwood
at
once
realized
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
two
fortunate
young
people
who
had
succeeded
so
suddenly
and
according
to
popular
opinion
so
unexpectedly
to
john
mallathorpe
wealth
this
was
evidently
miss
nesta
mallathorpe
of
whom
he
had
heard
but
whom
he
had
never
seen
she
however
was
looking
at
him
as
if
she
knew
him
and
she
smiled
a
little
as
she
acknowledged
his
bow
my
mother
is
out
in
the
grounds
with
my
brother
she
said
motioning
collingwood
towards
a
chair
wo
you
sit
down
please
i
sent
for
her
she
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
collingwood
sat
down
nesta
mallathorpe
sat
down
too
and
as
they
looked
at
each
other
she
smiled
again
i
have
seen
you
before
collingwood
she
said
i
knew
it
must
be
you
when
they
brought
up
your
card
collingwood
used
his
glance
of
polite
inquiry
to
make
a
closer
inspection
of
his
hostess
he
decided
that
nesta
mallathorpe
was
not
so
much
pretty
as
eminently
attractive
a
tall
young
woman
whose
clear
grey
eyes
and
red
lips
and
general
bearing
indicated
the
possession
of
good
health
and
spirits
and
he
was
quite
certain
that
if
he
had
ever
seen
her
before
he
would
not
have
forgotten
it
where
have
you
seen
me
he
asked
smiling
back
at
her
have
you
forgotten
the
year
before
last
she
asked
collingwood
remembered
what
she
was
alluding
to
he
had
taken
part
in
company
with
various
other
law
students
in
a
a
breach
of
promise
case
for
the
benefit
of
a
certain
london
hospital
to
him
had
fallen
one
of
the
principal
parts
that
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
when
i
saw
your
name
i
remembered
it
at
once
she
went
on
i
was
there
i
was
a
probationer
at
chad
hospital
at
that
time
dear
me
said
collingwood
i
should
have
thought
our
histrionic
efforts
would
have
been
forgotten
i
afraid
i
do
remember
much
about
them
except
that
we
had
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
the
affair
so
you
were
at
st
chad
he
continued
with
a
reminiscence
of
the
surroundings
of
the
institution
they
were
talking
of
very
different
to
normandale
yes
she
replied
very
very
different
to
normandale
but
when
i
was
at
chad
i
did
know
that
i
that
we
should
ever
come
to
normandale
and
now
that
you
are
here
he
asked
the
girl
looked
out
through
the
big
window
on
the
valley
which
lay
in
front
of
the
old
house
and
she
shook
her
head
a
little
it
very
beautiful
she
answered
but
i
sometimes
wish
i
was
back
at
chad
with
something
to
do
here
there
nothing
to
do
but
to
do
nothing
collingwood
realized
that
this
was
not
the
complaint
of
the
young
woman
who
finds
time
hang
heavy
it
was
rather
indicative
of
a
desire
for
action
i
understand
he
said
i
think
i
should
feel
like
that
one
wants
i
suppose
is
it
action
movement
what
is
it
better
call
it
occupation
that
a
plain
term
she
answered
both
suffering
from
lack
of
occupation
here
my
brother
and
i
and
bad
for
us
especially
for
him
before
collingwood
could
think
of
any
suitable
reply
to
this
remarkably
fresh
and
candid
statement
the
door
opened
and
mallathorpe
came
in
followed
by
her
son
and
the
visitor
suddenly
and
immediately
noticed
the
force
and
meaning
of
nesta
mallathorpe
last
remark
harper
mallathorpe
a
but
not
remarkably
intelligent
appearing
young
man
of
about
collingwood
own
age
gave
him
the
instant
impression
of
being
bored
to
death
the
eye
the
aimless
lounge
the
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
norfolk
jacket
as
if
they
took
refuge
there
from
sheer
idleness
all
these
things
told
their
tale
here
thought
collingwood
was
a
fine
example
of
how
riches
can
be
a
curse
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
having
to
earn
his
daily
bread
by
labour
harper
mallathorpe
was
finding
life
itself
laborious
but
there
was
nothing
of
aimlessness
idleness
or
lack
of
vigour
in
mallathorpe
she
was
a
woman
of
character
energy
of
brains
collingwood
saw
all
that
at
one
glance
a
little
compact
sort
of
woman
still
very
still
on
the
right
side
of
fifty
with
quick
movements
and
sharp
glances
out
of
a
pair
of
shrewd
eyes
this
he
thought
was
one
of
those
women
who
will
readily
undertake
the
control
and
management
of
big
affairs
he
felt
as
mallathorpe
turned
inquiring
looks
on
him
that
as
long
as
she
was
in
charge
of
them
the
mallathorpe
family
fortunes
would
be
safe
mother
said
nesta
handing
collingwood
card
to
mallathorpe
this
gentleman
is
bartle
collingwood
he
are
you
yes
a
barrister
he
wants
to
see
you
why
i
do
know
i
have
seen
collingwood
before
but
he
did
remember
me
now
he
tell
you
what
he
wants
to
see
you
about
if
you
allow
me
to
explain
why
i
called
on
you
mallathorpe
said
collingwood
i
do
suppose
you
ever
heard
of
me
but
you
know
at
any
rate
the
name
of
my
grandfather
antony
bartle
the
bookseller
of
barford
my
grandfather
is
dead
he
died
very
suddenly
last
night
mallathorpe
and
nesta
murmured
words
of
polite
sympathy
harper
suddenly
spoke
as
if
mere
words
were
some
relief
to
his
obvious
boredom
i
heard
that
this
morning
he
said
turning
to
his
mother
hopkins
told
me
he
was
in
town
last
night
i
meant
to
tell
you
dear
me
exclaimed
mallathorpe
glancing
at
some
letters
which
stood
on
a
rack
above
the
mantelpiece
why
i
had
a
letter
from
bartle
this
very
morning
it
is
that
letter
that
i
have
come
to
see
you
about
said
collingwood
i
only
got
down
here
from
london
at
eight
this
morning
and
of
course
i
have
made
some
inquiries
about
the
circumstances
of
my
grandfather
sudden
death
he
died
very
suddenly
indeed
at
eldrick
office
he
had
gone
there
on
some
business
about
which
nobody
knows
nothing
he
died
before
he
could
mention
it
and
according
to
his
jabey
naylor
the
last
thing
he
did
was
to
write
a
letter
to
you
now
i
have
reason
for
asking
would
you
mind
telling
me
mallathorpe
what
that
letter
was
about
mallathorpe
moved
over
to
the
hearth
and
took
an
envelope
from
the
rack
she
handed
it
to
collingwood
indicating
that
he
could
open
it
and
collingwood
drew
out
one
of
old
bartle
memorandum
forms
and
saw
a
couple
of
lines
in
the
familiar
crabbed
handwriting
mallathorpe
normandale
grange
madam
if
you
should
drive
into
town
tomorrow
will
you
kindly
give
me
a
call
i
want
to
see
you
particularly
respectfully
a
bartle
collingwood
handed
back
the
letter
have
you
any
idea
to
what
that
refers
he
asked
well
i
think
i
have
perhaps
answered
mallathorpe
bartle
persuaded
us
to
sell
him
some
books
local
books
which
my
late
had
at
his
office
in
the
mill
and
since
then
he
has
been
very
anxious
to
buy
more
local
books
and
pamphlets
about
this
neighbourhood
and
he
had
some
which
bartle
was
very
anxious
indeed
to
get
hold
of
i
suppose
he
wanted
to
see
me
about
that
collingwood
made
no
remarks
for
the
moment
he
was
wondering
whether
or
not
to
tell
what
jabey
naylor
had
told
him
about
this
paper
taken
from
the
linen
pocket
inside
the
of
but
mallathorpe
ready
explanation
had
given
him
a
new
idea
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
thank
you
he
said
i
suppose
that
it
you
may
think
it
odd
that
i
wanted
to
know
what
he
written
about
but
as
it
was
certainly
the
last
letter
he
wrote
oh
i
quite
sure
it
must
have
been
that
exclaimed
mallathorpe
and
as
i
am
going
into
barford
this
afternoon
in
any
case
i
meant
to
call
at
bartle
i
sorry
to
hear
of
his
death
poor
old
gentleman
but
he
was
very
old
indeed
was
he
he
was
well
over
eighty
replied
collingwood
well
thank
you
again
and
i
have
a
motorcar
waiting
outside
there
and
i
have
much
to
do
in
barford
when
i
get
back
the
two
young
people
accompanied
collingwood
into
the
hall
and
harper
suddenly
brightened
i
say
he
said
have
a
drink
before
you
go
it
a
long
way
in
and
out
come
into
the
but
collingwood
caught
nesta
eye
and
he
was
quick
to
read
a
signal
in
it
no
thanks
awfully
he
answered
i
wo
really
i
must
get
back
i
such
a
lot
of
things
to
attend
to
this
is
a
very
beautiful
place
of
yours
he
went
on
as
harper
whose
face
had
fallen
at
the
visitor
refusal
followed
with
his
sister
to
where
the
waited
it
might
be
a
hundred
miles
from
anywhere
it
a
thousand
miles
from
anywhere
muttered
harper
nothing
to
do
here
no
hunting
shooting
fishing
asked
collingwood
get
tired
of
well
why
not
make
a
private
in
your
park
you
get
a
fine
sporting
course
round
there
that
a
good
notion
harper
observed
nesta
with
some
eagerness
you
could
have
it
laid
out
this
winter
harper
suddenly
looked
at
collingwood
going
to
stop
in
barford
he
asked
till
i
settle
my
grandfather
affairs
yes
answered
collingwood
come
and
see
us
again
said
harper
come
for
the
night
we
got
a
jolly
good
billiard
table
do
added
nesta
heartily
since
you
so
kind
i
will
then
replied
collingwood
but
not
for
a
few
days
he
drove
off
to
wonder
why
he
had
visited
normandale
grange
at
all
for
mallathorpe
explanation
of
the
letter
was
doubtless
the
right
one
collingwood
little
as
he
had
seen
of
antony
bartle
knew
what
a
veritable
the
old
man
was
where
rare
books
or
engravings
were
concerned
yet
why
the
sudden
exclamation
on
finding
that
paper
why
the
immediate
writing
of
the
letter
to
mallathorpe
why
the
setting
off
to
eldrick
pascoe
office
as
soon
as
the
letter
was
written
it
all
looked
as
if
the
old
man
had
found
some
document
the
contents
of
which
related
to
the
mallathorpe
family
and
was
anxious
to
communicate
its
nature
to
mallathorpe
and
to
his
own
solicitor
as
soon
as
possible
but
that
probably
only
my
fancy
he
mused
as
he
sped
back
to
barford
the
real
explanation
is
doubtless
that
suggested
by
mallathorpe
something
made
the
old
man
think
of
the
collection
of
local
books
at
normandale
grange
and
he
immediately
wrote
off
to
ask
her
to
see
him
with
the
idea
of
persuading
her
to
let
him
have
them
all
there
is
in
it
what
a
suspicious
sort
of
party
i
must
be
getting
and
suspicious
of
whom
and
of
what
anyhow
i
glad
i
went
out
there
and
i
certainly
go
again
on
his
way
back
to
barford
he
thought
a
good
deal
of
the
two
young
people
he
had
just
left
there
was
something
of
the
irony
of
fate
about
their
situation
there
they
were
in
possession
of
money
and
luxury
and
youth
and
already
bored
because
they
had
nothing
to
do
he
felt
what
closely
approached
a
contemptuous
pity
for
harper
why
did
he
turn
to
some
occupation
there
was
their
own
business
why
did
he
put
in
so
many
hours
a
day
there
instead
of
leaving
it
to
managers
why
did
he
interest
himself
in
local
affairs
work
at
something
already
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
is
inclined
to
slackness
and
in
that
case
mused
collingwood
his
money
would
do
him
positive
harm
but
he
had
no
thoughts
of
that
sort
about
nesta
mallathorpe
he
had
seen
that
she
was
of
a
different
temperament
she
not
stick
there
idling
he
said
she
break
out
and
do
something
or
other
what
did
she
say
from
lack
of
occupation
a
bad
thing
to
suffer
from
too
glad
i
not
similarly
afflicted
there
was
immediate
occupation
for
collingwood
himself
when
he
reached
the
town
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
plans
he
would
sell
his
grandfather
business
as
soon
as
he
could
find
a
buyer
the
old
man
had
left
a
provision
in
his
will
the
gist
of
which
eldrick
had
already
communicated
to
collingwood
to
the
effect
that
his
grandson
could
either
carry
on
the
business
with
the
help
of
a
competent
manager
until
the
stock
was
sold
out
or
could
dispose
of
it
as
a
going
concern
collingwood
decided
to
sell
it
outright
and
at
once
but
first
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
look
round
the
collection
of
valuable
books
and
prints
and
get
an
idea
of
what
it
was
that
he
was
about
to
sell
and
when
he
had
reached
barford
again
and
had
lunched
at
his
hotel
he
went
to
quagg
alley
and
shut
himself
in
the
shop
and
made
a
careful
inspection
of
the
treasures
which
old
bartle
had
raked
up
from
many
quarters
within
ten
minutes
of
beginning
his
task
collingwood
knew
that
he
had
gone
out
to
normandale
grange
about
a
mere
nothing
picking
up
the
of
which
jabey
naylor
had
spoken
of
and
turning
over
its
leaves
two
papers
dropped
out
one
a
half
sheet
of
foolscap
folded
the
other
a
letter
from
some
correspondent
in
the
united
states
collingwood
read
the
letter
first
it
was
evidently
that
which
naylor
had
referred
to
as
having
been
delivered
the
previous
afternoon
it
asked
for
a
good
clear
copy
of
hopkinson
of
and
then
it
went
on
if
you
should
come
across
a
copy
of
what
is
i
believe
a
very
rare
tract
or
pamphlet
of
the
court
leet
of
the
manor
of
published
i
think
about
i
should
be
glad
to
pay
you
any
price
you
like
to
ask
for
it
in
reason
so
much
for
the
letter
collingwood
turned
from
it
to
the
folded
paper
it
was
headed
list
of
barford
tracts
and
pamphlets
in
my
box
marked
in
the
library
at
n
grange
and
it
was
initialled
at
the
foot
then
followed
the
titles
of
some
or
thirty
works
amongst
them
was
the
very
tract
for
which
the
american
correspondent
had
inquired
and
now
collingwood
had
what
he
believed
to
be
a
clear
vision
of
what
had
puzzled
him
his
grandfather
having
just
read
the
american
request
had
found
the
list
of
these
pamphlets
inside
the
of
and
in
it
the
entry
of
the
particular
one
he
wanted
and
at
once
he
had
written
to
mallathorpe
in
the
hope
of
persuading
her
to
sell
what
his
american
correspondent
desired
to
buy
it
was
all
quite
plain
and
the
old
man
visit
to
eldrick
pascoe
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
letter
to
mallathorpe
nor
had
he
carried
the
folded
paper
in
his
pocket
to
eldrick
when
jabey
naylor
went
out
to
post
the
letter
antony
had
placed
the
folded
paper
and
the
american
letter
together
in
the
book
and
left
them
there
quite
quite
simple
he
had
had
his
run
to
normandale
grange
and
back
all
about
nothing
and
for
nothing
except
that
he
had
met
nesta
mallathorpe
whom
he
was
already
sufficiently
interested
in
to
desire
to
see
again
but
having
arrived
at
an
explanation
of
what
had
puzzled
him
and
made
him
suspicious
he
dismissed
that
matter
from
his
mind
and
thought
no
more
of
it
but
across
the
street
all
unknown
to
collingwood
linford
pratt
was
thinking
a
good
deal
collingwood
had
taken
his
car
from
a
rank
immediately
opposite
eldrick
pascoe
windows
pratt
whose
desk
looked
on
to
the
street
had
seen
him
drive
away
soon
after
ten
and
return
about
twelve
pratt
who
knew
everybody
in
the
business
centre
of
the
town
knew
the
man
who
had
driven
collingwood
and
when
he
went
out
to
his
lunch
he
asked
him
where
he
had
been
that
morning
the
man
who
knew
no
reason
for
secrecy
told
him
and
pratt
went
off
to
eat
his
bread
and
cheese
and
drink
his
one
glass
of
ale
and
to
wonder
why
young
collingwood
had
been
to
normandale
grange
he
became
slightly
anxious
and
uneasy
he
knew
that
collingwood
must
have
made
some
slight
examination
of
old
bartle
papers
was
it
could
it
be
possible
that
the
old
man
before
going
to
eldrick
had
left
some
memorandum
of
his
discovery
in
his
desk
or
in
a
diary
he
had
said
that
he
had
not
shown
the
will
nor
mentioned
the
will
to
a
soul
but
he
might
old
men
were
so
fussy
about
things
he
might
have
set
down
in
his
diary
that
he
had
found
it
on
such
a
day
and
under
circumstances
however
there
was
one
person
who
could
definitely
inform
him
of
the
reason
of
collingwood
visit
to
normandale
grange
mallathorpe
he
would
see
her
at
once
and
learn
if
he
had
any
grounds
for
fear
and
so
it
came
about
that
at
nine
that
evening
mallathorpe
for
the
second
time
that
day
found
herself
asked
to
see
a
limb
of
the
law
chapter
v
mallathorpe
was
alone
when
pratt
card
was
taken
to
her
harper
and
nesta
were
playing
billiards
in
a
distant
part
of
the
big
house
dinner
had
been
over
for
an
hour
mallathorpe
who
had
known
what
hard
work
and
plenty
of
it
was
in
her
time
was
trifling
over
the
newspapers
rest
comfort
and
luxury
were
by
no
means
boring
to
her
she
looked
at
the
card
doubtfully
pratt
had
pencilled
a
word
or
two
on
it
private
and
important
business
then
she
glanced
at
the
butler
an
elderly
man
who
had
been
with
john
mallathorpe
many
years
before
the
catastrophe
occurred
who
is
he
dickenson
she
asked
do
you
know
him
clerk
at
eldrick
pascoe
in
the
town
replied
the
butler
i
know
the
young
man
by
sight
where
is
he
inquired
mallathorpe
in
the
little
morning
room
at
present
said
dickenson
take
him
into
the
study
commanded
mallathorpe
i
come
to
him
presently
she
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
understand
pratt
presence
there
eldrick
pascoe
were
not
her
solicitors
and
she
had
no
business
of
a
legal
nature
in
which
they
could
be
in
any
way
concerned
but
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
that
was
the
second
time
she
had
heard
eldrick
name
mentioned
that
day
young
collingwood
had
said
that
his
grandfather
death
had
taken
place
at
eldrick
pascoe
office
had
this
clerk
come
to
see
her
about
that
and
if
so
what
had
she
to
do
with
it
before
she
reached
the
room
in
which
pratt
was
waiting
for
her
mallathorpe
was
filled
with
curiosity
but
in
that
curiosity
there
was
not
a
trace
of
apprehension
nothing
suggested
to
her
that
her
visitor
had
called
on
any
matter
actually
relating
to
herself
or
her
family
the
room
into
which
pratt
had
been
taken
was
a
small
apartment
opening
out
of
the
library
john
mallathorpe
when
he
bought
normandale
grange
had
it
altered
and
fitted
to
suit
his
own
tastes
and
pratt
as
soon
as
he
entered
it
saw
that
it
was
a
place
in
which
privacy
and
silence
could
be
ensured
he
noticed
that
it
had
double
doors
and
that
there
were
heavy
curtains
before
the
window
and
during
the
few
minutes
which
elapsed
between
his
entrance
and
mallathorpe
he
took
the
precaution
to
look
behind
those
curtains
and
to
survey
his
surroundings
what
he
had
to
say
was
not
to
be
overheard
if
he
could
help
it
mallathorpe
looked
her
curiosity
as
soon
as
she
came
in
she
did
not
remember
that
she
had
ever
seen
this
young
man
before
but
she
recognized
at
once
that
he
was
a
shrewd
and
sharp
person
and
she
knew
from
his
manner
that
he
had
news
of
importance
to
give
her
she
quietly
acknowledged
pratt
somewhat
elaborate
bow
and
motioned
him
to
take
a
chair
at
the
side
of
the
big
desk
which
stood
before
the
fireplace
she
herself
sat
down
at
the
desk
itself
in
john
mallathorpe
old
and
pratt
thought
to
himself
that
however
much
young
harper
john
mallathorpe
might
be
nominal
master
of
normandale
grange
the
real
master
was
there
in
the
woman
who
turned
to
him
in
fashion
you
want
to
see
me
said
mallathorpe
what
is
it
business
mallathorpe
replied
pratt
as
i
said
on
my
card
of
a
private
and
important
sort
to
do
with
me
she
asked
with
you
and
with
your
family
said
pratt
and
before
we
go
any
further
not
a
soul
knows
of
it
but
me
mallathorpe
took
another
searching
look
at
her
visitor
pratt
was
leaning
over
the
corner
of
the
desk
towards
her
already
he
had
lowered
his
tones
to
the
mysterious
and
confidential
note
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
she
said
go
on
pratt
bent
a
little
nearer
a
question
or
two
first
if
you
please
mallathorpe
and
answer
them
they
for
your
own
good
young
collingwood
called
on
you
today
well
and
what
of
it
what
did
he
want
mallathorpe
hesitated
and
frowned
a
little
and
pratt
hastened
to
reassure
her
i
using
no
idle
words
mallathorpe
when
i
say
it
for
your
own
good
it
is
what
did
he
come
for
he
came
to
ask
what
there
was
in
a
letter
which
his
grandfather
wrote
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
antony
bartle
had
written
to
you
had
he
and
what
did
he
say
mallathorpe
for
that
is
important
no
more
than
that
he
wanted
me
to
call
on
him
today
if
i
happened
to
be
in
barford
nothing
more
nothing
more
not
a
word
nothing
as
to
why
he
wanted
to
see
you
no
i
thought
that
he
probably
wanted
to
see
me
about
buying
some
books
of
the
late
mr
mallathorpe
did
you
tell
collingwood
that
asked
pratt
eagerly
yes
of
course
did
it
satisfy
him
mallathorpe
frowned
again
why
should
i
she
demanded
it
was
the
only
explanation
i
could
possibly
give
him
how
do
i
know
what
the
old
man
really
wanted
pratt
drew
his
chair
still
nearer
to
the
desk
his
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
meaning
i
tell
you
what
he
wanted
he
said
speaking
very
slowly
it
what
i
come
for
listen
antony
bartle
came
to
our
office
soon
after
five
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
alone
everybody
else
had
gone
i
took
him
into
eldrick
room
he
told
me
that
in
turning
over
one
of
the
books
which
he
had
bought
from
mallathorpe
mill
some
short
time
ago
he
had
found
what
do
you
think
mallathorpe
cheek
had
flushed
at
the
mention
of
the
books
from
the
mill
now
at
pratt
question
and
under
his
searching
eye
she
turned
very
pale
and
the
clerk
saw
her
fingers
tighten
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
what
she
asked
what
john
mallathorpe
will
he
answered
do
you
understand
his
will
the
woman
glanced
quickly
about
her
at
the
doors
the
uncurtained
window
safe
enough
here
whispered
pratt
i
made
sure
of
that
do
be
afraid
no
one
knows
but
me
but
mallathorpe
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
in
speaking
and
when
she
at
last
got
out
a
word
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
impossible
it
a
fact
said
pratt
nothing
was
ever
more
a
fact
as
you
see
but
let
me
finish
my
story
the
old
man
told
me
how
he
found
the
will
only
half
an
hour
before
and
he
asked
me
to
ring
up
eldrick
so
that
we
might
all
read
it
together
i
went
to
the
telephone
when
i
came
back
bartle
was
dead
just
dead
and
i
took
the
will
out
of
his
pocket
mallathorpe
made
an
involuntary
gesture
with
her
right
hand
and
pratt
smiled
craftily
and
shook
his
head
much
too
valuable
to
carry
about
mallathorpe
he
said
i
got
it
all
safe
under
lock
and
key
but
as
i
said
nobody
knows
of
it
but
myself
not
a
living
soul
no
one
has
any
idea
no
one
can
have
any
idea
i
was
a
bit
alarmed
when
i
heard
that
young
collingwood
had
been
to
you
for
i
thought
that
the
old
man
though
he
did
tell
me
of
any
such
thing
might
have
dropped
you
a
line
saying
what
he
found
but
as
he
did
well
not
one
living
soul
knows
that
the
will
in
existence
except
me
and
you
mallathorpe
was
regaining
her
she
had
had
a
great
shock
but
the
worst
of
it
was
over
already
she
knew
from
manner
insidious
and
suggesting
that
the
will
was
of
a
nature
that
would
dispossess
her
and
hers
of
this
recently
acquired
wealth
the
clerk
had
made
that
evident
by
look
and
tone
so
there
was
nothing
but
to
face
things
what
what
does
it
say
she
asked
with
an
effort
pratt
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
plunged
a
hand
into
the
inner
pocket
drew
out
a
sheet
of
paper
unfolded
it
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
an
exact
copy
he
said
tersely
read
it
for
yourself
in
spite
of
the
determined
effort
which
she
made
to
be
calm
mallathorpe
fingers
still
trembled
as
she
took
up
the
sheet
on
which
pratt
had
made
a
fair
copy
of
the
will
the
clerk
watched
her
narrowly
as
she
read
he
knew
that
presently
there
would
be
a
tussle
between
them
he
knew
too
that
she
was
a
woman
who
would
fight
hard
in
defence
of
her
own
interest
and
for
the
interests
of
her
children
always
keeping
his
ears
open
to
local
gossip
especially
where
money
was
concerned
pratt
had
long
since
heard
that
mallathorpe
was
a
keen
and
sharp
business
woman
and
now
he
was
not
surprised
when
having
slowly
and
carefully
read
the
copy
of
the
will
from
beginning
to
end
she
laid
it
down
and
turned
to
him
with
a
question
the
effect
of
that
she
asked
what
would
it
be
curtly
precisely
what
it
says
answered
pratt
could
be
clearer
we
should
lose
all
she
demanded
almost
angrily
all
all
except
what
he
says
there
agreed
pratt
and
that
she
went
on
drumming
her
fingers
on
the
paper
that
would
stand
what
it
a
copy
of
would
stand
said
pratt
oh
yes
do
you
make
any
mistake
about
it
mallathorpe
nothing
can
upset
that
will
it
is
plain
as
a
pikestaff
how
it
came
to
be
made
your
late
evidently
wrote
his
will
out
it
all
in
his
own
handwriting
and
took
it
down
to
the
mill
with
him
the
very
day
of
the
chimney
accident
just
as
evidently
he
signed
it
in
the
presence
of
his
manager
gaukrodger
and
his
cashier
marshall
they
signed
at
the
same
time
as
it
says
there
now
i
take
it
that
very
soon
after
that
mallathorpe
went
out
into
his
mill
yard
to
have
a
look
at
the
chimney
gaukrodger
and
marshall
went
with
him
before
he
went
he
popped
the
will
into
the
book
where
old
bartle
found
it
yesterday
such
things
are
easily
done
perhaps
he
was
reading
the
book
perhaps
it
lay
handy
he
slipped
the
will
inside
anyway
and
then
he
was
killed
and
what
more
the
two
witnesses
were
killed
with
him
so
there
was
a
man
left
who
could
tell
of
that
will
but
there
half
barford
could
testify
to
these
three
signatures
mallathorpe
there
not
a
chance
for
you
if
i
put
that
will
into
the
hands
of
the
two
trustees
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
after
that
nodding
confidently
watching
keenly
and
now
he
saw
that
the
trembling
fingers
were
interlacing
each
other
twisting
the
rings
on
each
other
and
that
mallathorpe
was
thinking
as
she
had
most
likely
never
thought
in
her
life
after
a
moment
pause
pratt
went
on
perhaps
you
did
understand
he
said
i
mean
you
do
know
the
effect
those
two
trustees
charlesworth
wyatt
could
turn
you
all
clean
out
of
this
tomorrow
in
a
way
of
speaking
everything
theirs
they
can
demand
an
account
of
every
penny
that
you
all
had
out
of
the
estate
and
the
business
from
the
time
you
all
took
hold
if
anything
been
saved
put
aside
they
can
demand
that
you
entitled
to
nothing
but
the
three
amounts
of
ten
thousand
each
of
course
thirty
thousand
is
thirty
thousand
it
means
at
five
per
fifteen
hundred
a
year
if
you
could
get
five
per
cent
safely
but
i
should
say
your
son
and
daughter
are
getting
a
few
thousand
a
year
each
are
they
mallathorpe
it
would
be
a
nice
five
hundred
a
year
apiece
at
the
outside
a
small
house
instead
of
normandale
grange
genteel
poverty
comparatively
speaking
instead
of
riches
that
is
if
i
hand
over
the
will
to
charlesworth
wyatt
mallathorpe
slowly
turned
her
eyes
on
pratt
and
pratt
suddenly
felt
a
little
afraid
there
was
anger
in
those
eyes
anger
of
a
curious
sort
it
might
be
against
fate
against
circumstance
it
might
not
why
should
it
be
against
him
personally
but
it
was
there
and
it
was
malign
and
almost
evil
and
it
made
him
uncomfortable
where
is
the
will
she
asked
safe
in
my
keeping
answered
pratt
she
looked
him
all
over
surmisingly
you
sell
it
to
me
she
suggested
you
hand
it
over
and
let
me
burn
it
destroy
it
no
answered
pratt
i
shall
not
he
saw
that
his
answer
produced
personal
anger
at
last
mallathorpe
gave
him
a
look
which
would
have
warned
a
much
less
observant
man
than
pratt
but
he
gave
her
back
a
look
that
was
just
as
resolute
i
say
no
and
i
mean
no
he
continued
i
wo
sell
but
bargain
let
be
plain
with
each
other
you
do
want
that
will
to
be
handed
over
to
the
trustees
named
in
it
charlesworth
wyatt
do
you
think
i
a
fool
man
she
flashed
out
i
should
be
a
fool
myself
if
i
did
replied
pratt
calmly
and
i
not
a
fool
very
well
then
you
square
me
you
buy
me
come
to
terms
with
me
and
nobody
shall
ever
know
i
repeat
to
you
what
i
said
before
not
a
soul
knows
now
no
nor
suspects
it
utterly
impossible
for
anybody
to
find
out
the
testator
dead
the
attesting
witnesses
are
dead
the
man
who
found
this
will
is
dead
no
one
but
you
and
myself
ever
need
know
a
word
about
all
this
if
you
make
terms
with
me
mrs
mallathorpe
what
do
you
want
she
asked
sullenly
you
forget
i
nothing
of
my
own
i
did
come
into
anything
i
a
pretty
good
notion
who
real
master
here
and
at
mallathorpe
mill
too
retorted
pratt
i
should
say
you
still
in
full
control
of
your
children
mallathorpe
and
that
you
can
do
pretty
well
what
you
like
with
them
with
one
of
them
perhaps
she
said
still
angry
and
sullen
but
i
tell
you
for
you
may
as
well
know
if
my
daughter
knew
of
what
told
me
she
go
straight
to
these
trustees
and
tell
that
a
fact
that
you
better
realize
i
ca
control
her
oh
remarked
pratt
um
then
we
must
take
care
that
she
know
but
we
do
intend
that
anybody
should
know
but
you
and
me
mallathorpe
you
need
tell
a
soul
not
even
your
son
you
tell
listen
now
i
thought
out
a
good
scheme
which
profit
me
and
make
you
safe
do
you
know
what
you
want
on
this
estate
she
stared
at
him
as
if
wondering
what
this
question
had
to
do
with
the
matter
which
was
of
such
infinite
importance
and
pratt
smiled
and
hastened
to
enlighten
her
you
want
a
steward
he
said
a
steward
and
estate
agent
john
mallathorpe
managed
everything
for
himself
but
your
son
ca
and
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
you
ca
properly
you
need
a
man
you
need
me
you
can
persuade
your
son
to
that
effect
give
me
the
job
of
steward
here
i
suggest
to
you
how
to
do
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
arouse
no
suspicion
and
look
just
like
an
ordinary
very
ordinary
business
job
at
a
salary
and
on
conditions
to
be
arranged
and
you
safe
safe
mallathorpe
you
know
what
that
means
mallathorpe
suddenly
rose
from
her
chair
i
know
this
she
said
i
discuss
nothing
and
do
nothing
till
i
seen
that
will
pratt
rose
too
nodding
his
head
as
if
quite
satisfied
he
took
up
the
copy
tore
it
in
two
pieces
and
carefully
dropped
them
into
the
glowing
fire
i
shall
be
at
my
lodgings
at
any
time
after
tomorrow
evening
he
answered
quietly
call
there
you
have
the
address
and
you
can
then
read
the
will
with
your
own
eyes
i
sha
bring
it
here
the
game
in
my
hands
mrs
mallathorpe
within
a
few
minutes
he
was
out
in
the
park
again
and
making
his
way
to
the
little
railway
station
in
the
valley
below
he
felt
triumphant
he
knew
that
the
woman
he
had
just
left
was
at
his
mercy
and
would
accede
to
his
terms
and
all
the
way
back
to
town
and
through
the
town
to
his
lodgings
he
considered
and
perfected
the
scheme
he
was
going
to
suggest
to
mallathorpe
on
the
morrow
pratt
lived
in
a
little
hamlet
of
old
houses
on
the
very
outskirts
of
barford
on
the
edge
of
a
stretch
of
country
honeycombed
by
some
in
use
some
already
worked
out
it
was
a
lonely
neighbourhood
approached
from
the
nearest
tramway
route
by
a
narrow
lane
he
was
along
that
lane
when
a
stealthy
foot
stole
to
his
side
and
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
arm
just
as
stealthily
came
the
voice
of
one
of
his
at
eldrick
pascoe
a
moment
pratt
i
been
waiting
for
you
i
want
a
word
or
two
in
private
chapter
vi
the
unexpected
pratt
started
when
he
heard
that
voice
and
felt
the
arresting
hand
he
knew
well
enough
to
whom
they
belonged
they
were
those
of
one
james
parrawhite
a
little
weedy
dissolute
chap
who
had
been
in
eldrick
pascoe
employ
for
about
a
year
it
had
always
been
a
mystery
to
him
and
the
other
clerks
that
parrawhite
had
been
there
at
all
and
that
being
there
he
was
allowed
to
stop
he
was
not
a
barford
man
nobody
knew
anything
whatever
about
him
though
his
occasional
references
to
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
knew
london
pretty
thoroughly
pratt
shrewdly
suspected
that
he
was
a
man
whom
eldrick
had
known
in
other
days
possibly
a
solicitor
who
had
been
struck
off
the
rolls
and
to
whom
eldrick
for
old
times
sake
was
disposed
to
extend
a
helping
hand
all
that
any
of
them
knew
was
that
one
morning
some
fifteen
months
previously
parrawhite
a
complete
stranger
had
walked
into
the
office
asked
to
see
eldrick
had
remained
closeted
with
him
half
an
hour
and
had
been
given
a
job
at
two
pounds
a
week
there
and
then
that
he
was
a
clever
and
useful
clerk
no
one
denied
but
no
one
liked
him
he
was
always
borrowing
he
smelt
of
rum
he
was
altogether
undesirable
it
was
plain
to
the
clerks
that
pascoe
disliked
him
but
he
was
evidently
under
eldrick
protection
and
he
did
his
work
and
did
it
well
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
knew
more
law
than
either
of
the
partners
and
was
better
up
in
practice
than
pratt
himself
but
he
was
not
desirable
and
pratt
never
desired
him
less
than
on
this
occasion
what
are
you
after
coming
on
a
man
like
that
growled
pratt
you
replied
parrawhite
i
knew
you
got
to
come
up
this
lane
so
i
waited
for
you
i
something
to
say
get
it
said
then
retorted
pratt
not
here
answered
parrawhite
come
down
by
the
quarry
nobody
about
there
and
suppose
i
do
asked
pratt
then
you
be
very
sorry
for
yourself
tomorrow
replied
parrawhite
that
all
pratt
had
already
realized
that
this
fellow
knew
something
manner
was
not
only
threatening
but
confident
he
spoke
as
a
man
speaks
who
has
got
the
whip
hand
and
so
still
growling
and
inwardly
raging
and
anxious
he
turned
off
with
his
companion
into
a
track
which
lay
amongst
the
stone
quarries
it
was
a
desolate
lonely
place
no
house
was
near
they
were
as
much
alone
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
great
moors
outside
the
town
the
lights
of
which
they
could
see
in
the
valley
below
them
in
the
grey
sky
above
a
waning
moon
gave
them
just
sufficient
light
to
see
their
immediate
surroundings
a
track
no
longer
used
and
the
yawning
mouths
of
the
old
quarries
no
longer
worked
the
edges
of
which
were
thick
with
gorse
and
bramble
it
was
the
very
place
for
secret
work
and
pratt
was
certain
that
secret
work
was
at
hand
now
then
he
said
when
they
had
walked
well
into
the
wilderness
what
is
it
and
no
nonsense
you
get
no
nonsense
from
me
sneered
parrawhite
i
not
that
sort
this
is
what
i
want
to
say
i
was
in
eldrick
office
last
night
all
the
time
you
were
there
with
old
bartle
this
swift
answer
went
straight
through
pratt
defences
he
was
prepared
to
hear
something
unpleasant
and
disconcerting
but
not
that
and
he
voiced
the
first
thought
that
occurred
to
him
that
a
lie
he
exclaimed
there
was
nobody
there
no
lie
replied
parrawhite
i
was
there
i
was
behind
the
curtain
of
that
recess
you
know
and
since
i
know
what
you
did
i
do
mind
telling
you
we
in
the
same
boat
my
lad
what
i
was
going
to
do
you
thought
i
gone
with
the
others
but
i
had
i
merely
done
what
i
done
several
times
without
being
found
out
slipped
in
there
to
wait
until
you
gone
why
because
friend
eldrick
as
you
know
is
culpably
careless
about
leaving
loose
cash
in
the
unlocked
drawer
of
his
desk
culpably
careless
too
about
never
counting
it
and
a
stray
sovereign
or
is
useful
to
a
man
who
only
gets
two
quid
a
week
understand
so
you
a
thief
said
pratt
bitterly
i
precisely
what
you
are
a
thief
retorted
parrawhite
you
stole
john
mallathorpe
will
last
night
i
heard
everything
i
tell
you
and
saw
everything
i
heard
the
whole
business
what
the
old
man
said
what
you
later
said
to
eldrick
i
saw
old
bartle
die
i
saw
you
take
the
will
from
his
pocket
read
it
and
put
it
in
your
pocket
i
know
all
except
the
terms
of
the
will
but
i
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
those
terms
are
do
you
know
why
because
i
watched
you
set
off
to
normandale
by
the
train
tonight
hang
you
for
a
dirty
sneak
growled
pratt
parrawhite
laughed
and
flourished
a
heavy
stick
which
he
carried
not
a
bit
of
it
he
said
almost
pleasantly
i
thought
you
were
more
of
a
philosopher
i
fancied
i
seen
gleams
mere
gleams
of
philosophy
in
you
at
times
fortunes
of
war
my
boy
come
now
you
seen
enough
of
me
to
know
i
an
adventurer
this
is
an
adventure
of
the
sort
i
love
go
into
it
heart
and
soul
man
own
up
you
found
out
that
the
will
leaves
the
property
away
from
the
present
holders
and
you
been
to
normandale
to
bargain
come
now
what
then
demanded
pratt
then
of
course
i
come
in
at
the
bargaining
answered
parrawhite
i
going
to
have
my
share
that
a
certainty
you
better
take
my
advice
because
you
absolutely
in
my
power
i
nothing
to
do
but
to
tell
eldrick
tomorrow
morning
suppose
i
tell
eldrick
tomorrow
morning
of
what
you
told
me
interjected
pratt
eldrick
will
believe
me
before
you
retorted
parrawhite
imperturbably
i
a
much
cleverer
more
plausible
man
than
you
are
my
friend
i
had
an
experience
of
the
world
which
you
have
i
can
easily
invent
a
fine
excuse
for
being
in
that
room
for
two
pins
incriminate
you
see
be
reasonable
for
if
it
comes
to
a
contest
of
brains
you
have
a
rabbit
chance
against
a
fox
tell
me
all
about
the
will
and
what
you
done
you
got
to
for
by
the
lord
harry
i
going
to
have
my
share
come
now
pratt
stood
in
a
little
hollow
wherein
they
had
paused
and
thought
rapidly
and
angrily
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
was
trapped
this
fearful
scoundrel
at
his
side
who
boasted
of
his
cleverness
would
stick
to
him
like
a
leach
he
would
have
to
share
all
his
own
smart
schemes
for
exploiting
mallathorpe
for
ensuring
himself
a
competence
for
life
were
knocked
on
the
head
there
was
no
helping
it
he
would
have
to
tell
and
to
share
and
so
sullenly
resentfully
he
told
parrawhite
listened
in
silence
taking
in
every
point
pratt
knowing
that
concealment
was
useless
told
the
truth
about
everything
concisely
but
omitting
nothing
all
right
remarked
parrawhite
at
the
end
now
then
what
terms
do
you
mean
to
insist
on
what
the
good
of
going
into
that
growled
pratt
now
that
stuck
your
foot
in
it
what
do
my
terms
matter
quite
right
agreed
parrawhite
they
do
what
matter
is
our
terms
now
let
me
suggest
no
insist
on
what
they
must
be
cash
do
you
know
why
i
insist
on
that
no
then
i
tell
you
because
this
young
barrister
chap
collingwood
has
evidently
got
some
suspicion
of
something
i
ca
see
it
said
pratt
uneasily
he
was
only
curious
to
know
what
that
letter
was
about
never
mind
continued
parrawhite
he
had
some
suspicion
or
he
would
have
gone
out
there
almost
as
soon
as
he
reached
barford
after
his
grandfather
death
and
even
if
suspicion
is
put
to
sleep
for
awhile
it
can
easily
be
reawakened
so
cash
we
must
profit
at
once
before
any
future
risk
arises
but
what
terms
were
you
thinking
of
stewardship
of
this
estate
for
life
muttered
pratt
gloomily
with
the
risk
of
some
discovery
being
made
some
time
any
time
sneered
parrawhite
where
are
your
brains
man
the
old
fellow
john
mallathorpe
probably
made
a
draft
or
two
of
that
will
before
he
did
his
fair
copy
he
may
have
left
those
drafts
among
his
papers
if
he
did
mallathorpe
find
said
pratt
slowly
i
believe
there
the
slightest
risk
i
figured
everything
out
i
believe
there
any
danger
from
collingwood
or
from
anybody
impossible
and
if
we
take
cash
now
we
selling
for
a
penny
what
we
ought
to
get
pounds
for
the
present
is
much
more
important
than
the
future
my
friend
answered
parrawhite
to
me
at
any
rate
now
then
this
is
my
proposal
i
be
with
you
when
this
lady
calls
at
your
place
tomorrow
evening
we
offer
her
the
will
to
do
what
she
likes
with
for
ten
thousand
pounds
she
can
find
that
quickly
when
she
pays
as
she
will
we
share
equally
and
then
well
you
can
go
to
the
devil
i
shall
go
somewhere
else
so
that
settled
no
said
pratt
parrawhite
turned
sharply
and
pratt
saw
a
sinister
gleam
in
his
eyes
did
you
say
no
he
asked
i
said
no
replied
pratt
i
not
going
to
take
five
thousand
pounds
for
a
chance
that
worth
fifty
thousand
hang
you
if
you
had
been
a
black
as
you
are
i
have
had
the
whole
thing
to
myself
and
i
do
know
that
i
will
give
way
to
you
if
it
comes
to
it
my
word
as
good
as
yours
and
i
do
believe
eldrick
would
believe
you
before
me
pascoe
would
anyway
you
got
a
past
in
quod
i
should
think
my
past
all
right
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
let
you
do
your
worst
after
all
i
got
the
will
and
by
george
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
can
do
your
worst
tell
what
you
like
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
tell
what
you
are
a
scoundrel
he
turned
away
at
that
and
as
he
turned
parrawhite
with
a
queer
cry
of
rage
that
might
have
come
from
some
animal
which
saw
its
prey
escaping
struck
out
at
him
with
the
heavy
stick
the
blow
missed
pratt
head
but
it
grazed
the
tip
of
his
ear
and
fell
slantingly
on
his
left
shoulder
and
then
the
anger
that
had
been
boiling
in
pratt
ever
since
the
touch
on
his
arm
in
the
dark
lane
burst
out
in
activity
and
he
turned
on
his
assailant
gripped
him
by
the
throat
before
parrawhite
could
move
and
after
choking
and
shaking
him
until
his
teeth
rattled
and
his
breath
came
in
jerking
sobs
flung
him
violently
against
the
masses
of
stone
by
which
they
had
been
standing
pratt
was
of
considerable
physical
strength
he
played
cricket
and
football
he
visited
a
gymnasium
thrice
a
week
his
hands
had
the
grip
of
a
blacksmith
his
muscles
were
those
of
a
he
had
put
more
strength
than
he
was
aware
of
into
his
fierce
grip
on
throat
he
had
exerted
far
more
force
than
he
knew
he
was
exerting
when
he
flung
him
away
he
heard
a
queer
cracking
sound
as
the
man
struck
something
and
for
the
moment
he
took
no
notice
of
it
the
pain
of
that
glancing
blow
on
his
shoulder
was
growing
acute
and
he
began
to
rub
it
with
his
free
hand
and
to
curse
its
giver
get
up
you
fool
and
i
give
you
some
more
he
growled
i
teach
you
to
he
suddenly
noticed
the
curiously
still
fashion
in
which
parrawhite
was
lying
where
he
had
flung
him
noticed
too
as
a
cloud
passed
the
moon
and
left
it
unveiled
how
strangely
white
the
man
face
was
and
just
as
suddenly
pratt
forgot
his
own
injury
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
his
assailant
an
instant
later
and
he
knew
that
he
was
once
more
confronting
death
for
parrawhite
was
as
dead
as
antony
bartle
violent
contact
of
his
head
with
a
rock
had
finished
what
pratt
had
nearly
completed
with
that
vicious
grip
there
was
no
questioning
it
no
denying
it
pratt
was
there
in
that
lonely
place
staring
half
consciously
half
in
terror
at
a
dead
man
he
stood
up
at
last
cursing
parrawhite
with
the
anger
of
despair
he
had
not
one
scrap
of
pity
for
him
all
his
pity
was
for
himself
that
he
should
have
been
brought
into
this
that
this
vile
little
beast
perfect
scum
that
he
was
should
have
led
him
to
what
might
be
the
utter
ruin
of
his
career
it
was
shameful
it
was
abominable
it
was
cruel
he
felt
as
if
he
could
cheerfully
tear
parrawhite
dead
body
to
pieces
but
even
as
these
thoughts
came
others
of
a
more
important
nature
crowded
on
them
for
there
lay
a
dead
man
who
was
not
to
be
put
in
one
pocket
like
a
will
it
was
necessary
to
hide
that
thing
from
the
light
ever
that
light
within
a
few
hours
morning
would
break
and
lonely
and
deserted
as
that
place
was
nowadays
some
one
might
pass
that
way
out
of
sight
with
him
then
and
quickly
pratt
was
very
well
acquainted
with
the
spot
at
which
he
stood
those
old
quarries
had
a
certain
picturesqueness
they
had
become
ivy
shrubs
trees
had
clustered
about
them
the
people
who
lived
in
the
few
houses
half
a
mile
away
sometimes
walked
around
them
the
children
made
a
playground
of
the
place
pratt
himself
had
often
gone
into
some
quiet
corner
to
read
and
smoke
and
now
his
quick
mind
immediately
suggested
a
safe
hiding
place
for
this
thing
that
he
could
not
carry
away
with
him
and
dare
not
leave
to
the
morning
sun
close
by
was
a
pit
formerly
used
for
some
quarrying
purpose
which
was
filled
always
filled
with
water
it
was
evidently
of
considerable
depth
the
water
was
black
in
it
the
mouth
was
partly
obscured
by
a
maze
of
shrub
and
bramble
it
had
been
like
that
ever
since
pratt
came
to
lodge
in
that
part
of
the
district
ten
or
twelve
years
before
it
would
probably
remain
like
that
for
many
a
long
year
to
come
that
bit
of
land
was
absolutely
useless
and
therefore
neglected
and
as
long
as
rain
fell
and
water
drained
that
pit
would
always
be
filled
to
its
brim
he
remembered
something
else
also
close
by
where
he
stood
a
heap
of
old
iron
things
broken
and
disused
picks
smashed
rails
fragments
thrown
aside
when
the
last
of
the
limestone
had
been
torn
out
of
the
quarries
once
more
luck
was
playing
into
his
hands
those
odds
and
ends
might
have
been
put
there
for
the
very
purpose
to
which
he
now
meant
to
turn
them
and
being
certain
that
he
was
alone
and
secure
pratt
proceeded
to
go
about
his
unpleasant
task
skilfully
and
methodically
he
fetched
a
quantity
of
the
iron
fastened
it
to
the
dead
man
clothing
drew
the
body
thus
weighted
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
prepared
to
slide
it
into
the
black
water
but
there
an
idea
struck
him
while
he
made
these
preparations
he
had
had
hosts
of
ideas
as
to
his
operations
next
morning
this
idea
was
supplementary
to
them
quickly
and
methodically
he
removed
the
contents
of
parrawhite
pockets
to
his
own
everything
money
watch
and
chain
even
a
ring
which
the
dead
man
had
been
evidently
vain
of
then
he
let
parrawhite
glide
into
the
water
and
after
him
he
sent
the
heavy
stick
carefully
fastened
to
a
bar
of
iron
five
minutes
later
the
surface
of
the
water
in
that
pit
was
as
calm
and
unruffled
as
ever
not
a
ripple
showed
that
it
had
been
disturbed
and
pratt
made
his
way
out
of
the
wilderness
swearing
that
he
would
never
enter
it
again
chapter
vii
the
supreme
inducement
pratt
was
in
eldrick
pascoe
office
soon
after
eight
next
morning
and
for
nearly
forty
minutes
he
had
the
place
entirely
to
himself
but
it
took
only
a
few
of
those
minutes
for
him
to
do
what
he
had
carefully
planned
before
he
went
to
bed
the
previous
night
shutting
himself
into
eldrick
private
room
and
making
sure
that
he
was
alone
that
time
he
immediately
opened
the
drawer
in
the
senior
desk
wherein
eldrick
culpably
enough
as
parrawhite
had
sneeringly
remarked
was
accustomed
to
put
loose
money
eldrick
was
strangely
careless
in
that
way
he
would
throw
money
into
that
drawer
in
presence
of
his
clerks
notes
gold
silver
if
it
happened
to
occur
to
him
he
would
take
the
money
out
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
and
hand
it
to
pratt
to
lock
up
in
the
safe
but
as
often
as
not
it
did
not
occur
pratt
had
more
than
once
ventured
on
a
hint
which
was
almost
a
remonstrance
and
eldrick
had
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
was
a
careless
man
in
many
respects
eldrick
and
liked
to
do
things
in
his
own
way
and
after
all
as
pratt
had
decided
when
he
found
that
his
hints
were
not
listened
to
it
was
eldrick
own
affair
if
he
liked
to
leave
the
money
lying
about
there
was
money
lying
about
in
that
drawer
when
pratt
drew
it
open
it
was
never
locked
day
or
night
or
if
it
was
the
key
was
left
in
it
as
soon
as
he
opened
it
he
saw
gold
two
or
three
sovereigns
and
silver
a
little
pile
of
it
and
under
a
letter
weight
four
banknotes
of
ten
pounds
each
but
this
was
precisely
what
pratt
had
expected
to
see
he
himself
had
handed
banknotes
gold
and
silver
to
eldrick
the
previous
evening
just
after
receiving
them
from
a
client
who
had
called
to
pay
his
bill
and
he
had
seen
eldrick
place
them
in
the
drawer
as
usual
and
soon
afterwards
eldrick
had
walked
out
saying
he
was
going
to
the
club
and
he
had
never
returned
what
pratt
now
did
was
done
as
the
result
of
careful
thought
and
deliberation
there
was
a
lying
on
top
of
some
papers
in
the
drawer
he
took
it
up
and
tore
three
cheques
out
of
it
then
he
picked
up
the
tore
them
and
the
abstracted
blank
cheques
into
pieces
and
dropped
the
pieces
in
the
fire
recently
lighted
by
the
caretaker
he
watched
these
fragments
burn
and
then
he
put
the
gold
and
silver
in
his
where
he
already
carried
a
good
deal
of
his
own
and
walked
out
nine
brought
the
a
nine
brought
the
clerks
at
ten
eldrick
walked
in
according
to
custom
pratt
went
into
eldrick
room
with
the
letters
and
went
through
them
with
him
one
of
them
contained
a
legal
document
over
which
the
solicitor
frowned
a
little
ask
parrawhite
opinion
about
that
he
said
presently
indicating
a
marked
paragraph
parrawhite
has
not
come
in
this
morning
sir
observed
pratt
gathering
up
letters
and
papers
i
draw
his
attention
to
it
when
he
arrives
he
went
into
the
outer
office
only
to
be
summoned
back
to
eldrick
a
few
minutes
later
the
senior
partner
was
standing
by
his
desk
looking
a
little
concerned
and
thought
pratt
decidedly
uncomfortable
he
motioned
the
clerk
to
close
the
door
has
parrawhite
come
he
asked
no
replied
pratt
not
yet
mr
eldrick
is
is
he
usually
late
inquired
eldrick
usually
quite
punctual
nine
said
pratt
eldrick
glanced
at
his
watch
then
at
his
clerk
did
you
give
me
some
cash
last
night
he
asked
pounds
nine
answered
pratt
thompson
bill
of
costs
he
paid
it
yesterday
afternoon
eldrick
looked
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
well
the
fact
is
he
said
i
i
meant
to
hand
it
to
you
to
put
in
the
safe
pratt
but
i
did
come
back
from
the
club
and
it
gone
pratt
simulated
concern
but
not
astonishment
and
eldrick
pulled
open
the
drawer
and
waved
a
hand
over
it
i
put
it
down
there
he
said
very
careless
of
me
no
doubt
but
nothing
of
this
sort
has
ever
happened
before
and
however
there
the
unpleasant
fact
pratt
the
money
gone
pratt
who
had
hastily
turned
over
the
papers
and
other
contents
of
the
drawer
shook
his
head
and
used
his
privilege
as
an
old
and
confidential
servant
i
always
said
sir
that
it
was
a
great
mistake
to
leave
loose
money
lying
about
he
remarked
mournfully
if
there
only
been
a
practice
of
letting
me
lock
anything
of
that
sort
up
in
the
safe
every
night
and
this
chequebook
too
sir
then
i
know
i
know
said
eldrick
very
reprehensible
on
my
part
afraid
i
am
careless
no
doubt
of
it
but
he
in
his
turn
was
interrupted
by
pratt
who
was
turning
over
the
some
cheque
forms
have
been
taken
out
of
this
he
said
three
at
the
end
look
there
sir
eldrick
uttered
an
exclamation
of
intense
annoyance
and
disgust
he
looked
at
the
despoiled
and
flung
it
into
the
drawer
pratt
he
said
turning
half
appealingly
half
confidentially
to
the
clerk
do
say
a
word
of
this
above
all
do
mention
it
to
pascoe
it
my
fault
and
i
must
make
the
pounds
good
pratt
i
afraid
this
is
parrawhite
work
i
well
i
may
as
well
tell
you
he
been
in
trouble
before
he
came
here
i
gave
him
another
chance
i
known
him
years
ago
i
thought
he
go
straight
but
i
fear
he
been
tempted
he
may
have
seen
me
leave
money
about
was
he
in
here
last
night
pratt
pointed
to
a
document
which
lay
on
eldrick
desk
he
came
in
here
to
leave
that
for
your
perusal
he
answered
he
was
in
here
alone
a
minute
or
two
before
he
left
all
these
lies
came
readily
and
naturally
and
eldrick
swallowed
each
he
shook
his
head
my
fault
all
my
fault
he
said
look
here
keep
it
quiet
but
do
you
know
where
parrawhite
has
lived
lodged
no
replied
pratt
some
of
the
others
may
though
try
to
find
out
quickly
continued
eldrick
then
make
some
excuse
to
go
out
take
papers
somewhere
or
something
and
find
if
he
left
his
lodgings
i
i
do
want
to
set
the
police
on
him
he
was
a
decent
fellow
once
see
what
you
can
make
out
pratt
in
strict
secrecy
you
know
do
not
want
this
to
go
further
pratt
could
have
danced
for
joy
when
he
presently
went
out
into
the
town
there
would
be
no
after
parrawhite
none
eldrick
would
accept
the
fact
that
parrawhite
had
robbed
him
and
flown
and
parrawhite
would
never
be
heard
of
never
mentioned
again
it
was
the
height
of
good
luck
for
him
already
he
had
got
rid
of
any
small
scraps
of
regret
or
remorse
about
the
killing
of
his
why
should
he
be
sorry
the
scoundrel
had
tried
to
murder
him
thinking
no
doubt
that
he
had
the
will
on
him
and
he
had
not
meant
to
kill
him
what
he
had
done
he
had
done
in
no
everything
was
working
most
admirably
parrawhite
previous
bad
record
eldrick
carelessness
and
his
desire
to
shut
things
up
it
was
all
good
from
that
day
forward
parrawhite
would
be
as
if
he
had
never
been
pratt
was
not
even
afraid
of
the
body
being
discovered
though
he
believed
that
it
would
remain
where
it
was
for
ever
for
the
probability
was
that
the
authorities
would
fill
up
that
pit
with
earth
and
stones
but
if
it
was
brought
to
light
why
the
explanation
was
simple
parrawhite
having
robbed
his
employer
had
been
robbed
himself
possibly
by
men
with
whom
he
had
been
drinking
and
had
been
murdered
in
the
bargain
no
suspicion
could
attach
to
him
pratt
he
had
nothing
to
fear
nothing
for
the
form
of
the
thing
he
called
at
the
place
whereat
parrawhite
had
lodged
they
had
seen
nothing
of
him
since
the
previous
morning
they
were
poor
cheap
lodgings
in
a
mean
street
the
woman
of
the
house
said
that
parrawhite
had
gone
out
as
usual
the
morning
before
and
had
never
been
in
again
in
order
to
find
out
all
he
could
pratt
asked
if
he
had
left
much
behind
him
in
the
way
of
belongings
and
just
as
he
had
expected
he
learned
that
parrawhite
personal
property
was
remarkably
limited
he
possessed
only
one
suit
of
clothes
and
not
over
much
besides
said
the
landlady
is
there
aught
wrong
she
asked
when
pratt
had
finished
his
questions
are
you
from
where
he
worked
that
it
answered
pratt
and
he
has
turned
up
this
morning
and
we
think
he
left
the
town
owe
you
anything
missis
nay
nothing
much
she
replied
ten
shillings
cover
it
mister
pratt
gave
her
half
a
sovereign
it
was
not
out
of
consideration
for
her
nor
as
a
concession
to
parrawhite
memory
it
was
simply
to
stop
her
from
coming
down
to
eldrick
pascoe
well
i
do
think
you
see
him
again
he
remarked
and
i
dare
say
you
wo
care
if
you
do
he
turned
away
then
but
before
he
had
gone
far
the
woman
called
him
back
what
am
i
to
do
with
his
bits
of
things
mister
if
he
does
come
back
she
asked
aught
you
please
answered
pratt
indifferently
throw
on
the
as
he
went
back
to
the
centre
of
the
town
he
occupied
himself
in
considering
his
attitude
to
mallathorpe
when
she
called
on
him
that
evening
in
spite
of
his
own
previous
notion
and
of
his
scheme
about
the
stewardship
he
had
been
impressed
by
what
parrawhite
has
said
as
to
the
wisdom
of
selling
the
will
for
cash
pratt
did
not
believe
that
there
was
anything
in
the
collingwood
suggestion
no
doubt
whatever
he
had
decided
that
old
bartle
had
meant
to
tell
mallathorpe
of
his
discovery
when
she
called
in
answer
to
his
note
but
as
he
had
died
before
she
could
call
and
as
he
had
told
nobody
but
him
pratt
what
possible
danger
could
there
be
from
collingwood
and
a
stewardship
for
life
appealed
to
him
he
knew
from
observation
of
the
world
what
a
fine
thing
it
is
to
have
a
certainty
once
he
became
steward
and
agent
of
the
normandale
grange
estate
he
would
stick
there
until
he
had
saved
a
tidy
heap
of
money
then
he
would
retire
with
a
pension
and
a
handsome
present
and
enjoy
himself
to
be
provided
for
for
life
what
more
could
a
wise
man
want
and
yet
there
was
something
in
what
that
devil
parrawhite
had
urged
for
there
was
a
risk
however
small
of
discovery
and
if
discovery
were
made
there
would
be
a
nice
penalty
to
pay
it
might
after
all
be
better
to
sell
the
will
outright
for
as
much
ready
money
as
ever
he
could
get
and
to
take
his
gains
far
away
and
start
out
on
a
career
elsewhere
after
all
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
the
old
proverb
the
only
question
was
was
the
bird
in
hand
worth
the
two
or
the
money
which
he
believed
he
would
net
in
the
bush
pratt
doubts
on
this
point
were
settled
in
a
curious
fashion
he
had
reached
the
centre
of
the
town
in
his
return
to
eldrick
and
there
in
the
fashionable
shopping
street
he
ran
up
against
an
acquaintance
he
and
the
acquaintance
stopped
and
chatted
about
nothing
and
as
they
lounged
on
the
curb
a
smart
victoria
drew
up
close
by
and
out
of
it
alone
stepped
a
girl
who
immediately
attracted
pratt
eyes
he
watched
her
across
the
pavement
he
watched
her
into
the
shop
and
his
companion
laughed
that
the
sort
he
remarked
flippantly
if
you
and
i
had
one
each
old
man
what
who
is
she
demanded
pratt
the
acquaintance
stared
at
him
in
surprise
what
he
exclaimed
you
do
know
that
miss
mallathorpe
i
did
know
said
pratt
fact
he
waited
until
nesta
mallathorpe
came
out
and
drove
away
so
that
he
could
get
another
and
a
closer
look
at
her
and
when
she
was
gone
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
office
his
mind
made
up
risk
or
no
risk
he
would
carry
out
his
original
notion
whatever
mallathorpe
might
offer
he
would
stick
to
his
idea
of
close
and
intimate
connection
with
normandale
grange
chapter
viii
terms
mallathorpe
left
to
face
the
situation
which
pratt
had
revealed
to
her
in
such
sudden
and
startling
fashion
had
been
quick
to
realize
its
seriousness
it
had
not
taken
much
to
convince
her
that
the
clerk
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
she
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
was
right
when
he
said
that
the
production
of
john
mallathorpe
will
would
mean
dispossession
to
her
children
and
through
them
to
herself
nor
had
she
any
doubt
either
of
pratt
intention
to
profit
by
his
discovery
she
saw
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
determination
not
at
all
scrupulous
eager
to
seize
on
anything
likely
to
turn
to
his
own
advantage
she
was
in
short
at
his
mercy
and
she
had
no
one
to
turn
to
her
son
was
weak
purposeless
almost
devoid
of
character
he
cared
for
nothing
beyond
ease
and
comfort
and
left
everything
to
her
so
long
as
he
was
allowed
to
do
what
he
liked
she
dared
not
confide
in
him
he
was
not
fit
to
be
entrusted
with
such
a
secret
nor
endowed
with
the
courage
to
carry
it
boldly
and
unflinchingly
nor
dare
she
confide
it
to
her
daughter
nesta
was
as
strong
as
her
brother
was
weak
mallathorpe
had
only
told
the
plain
truth
when
she
said
to
pratt
that
if
her
daughter
knew
of
the
will
she
would
go
straight
to
the
two
trustees
no
she
would
have
to
do
everything
herself
and
she
could
do
nothing
save
under
dictation
so
long
as
he
had
that
will
in
his
possession
he
could
make
her
agree
to
whatever
terms
he
liked
to
insist
upon
she
spent
a
sleepless
night
resolving
all
sorts
of
plans
she
resolved
more
plans
and
schemes
during
the
day
which
followed
but
they
all
ended
at
the
same
point
pratt
all
the
future
depended
upon
pratt
and
by
the
end
of
the
day
it
had
come
to
this
she
must
make
a
determined
effort
to
buy
pratt
clean
out
so
that
she
could
get
the
will
into
her
own
possession
and
destroy
it
she
knew
that
she
could
easily
find
the
necessary
money
harper
mallathorpe
had
such
a
natural
dislike
of
all
business
matters
and
was
so
little
fitted
to
attend
to
them
that
he
was
only
too
well
content
to
leave
everything
relating
to
the
estate
and
the
mill
at
barford
to
his
mother
up
to
that
time
mallathorpe
had
managed
the
affairs
of
both
and
she
had
large
sums
at
her
disposal
out
of
which
she
could
pay
pratt
without
even
harper
being
aware
that
she
was
paying
him
anything
and
surely
no
young
man
in
pratt
position
a
mere
clerk
earning
a
few
pounds
a
week
would
refuse
a
big
sum
of
ready
money
it
seemed
incredible
to
her
and
she
went
into
barford
towards
evening
hoping
that
by
the
time
she
returned
the
will
would
have
been
burned
to
grey
ashes
mallathorpe
used
some
ingenuity
in
making
her
visit
to
pratt
giving
out
that
she
was
going
to
see
a
friend
in
barford
of
whose
illness
she
had
just
heard
she
drove
into
the
town
and
on
arriving
near
the
town
hall
dismissed
her
carriage
with
orders
to
the
coachman
to
put
up
his
horses
at
a
certain
livery
stable
and
to
meet
her
at
the
same
place
at
a
specified
time
then
she
went
away
on
foot
and
drew
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
before
hiring
a
cab
in
which
she
drove
up
to
the
outskirt
on
which
pratt
had
his
lodging
she
was
still
veiled
when
pratt
landlady
showed
her
into
the
clerk
is
it
safe
here
she
asked
at
once
is
there
no
fear
of
anybody
hearing
what
we
may
say
none
answered
pratt
reassuringly
i
know
these
folks
i
lived
here
several
years
and
nobody
could
hear
however
much
they
put
their
ears
to
the
keyhole
good
thick
old
walls
these
mallathorpe
and
a
solid
door
we
as
safe
here
as
we
were
in
your
study
last
night
mallathorpe
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
pratt
politely
drew
near
his
fire
she
raised
her
veil
and
looked
at
him
and
the
clerk
saw
at
once
how
curious
and
eager
she
was
that
will
she
said
in
a
low
voice
let
me
see
it
first
one
moment
answered
pratt
first
you
understand
that
i
not
going
to
let
you
handle
it
i
hold
it
before
you
so
you
can
read
it
second
you
give
me
your
promise
i
trusting
you
that
you
make
no
attempt
to
seize
it
it
not
going
out
of
my
hands
i
only
a
woman
and
you
a
strong
man
she
retorted
sullenly
quite
so
said
pratt
but
women
have
a
trick
of
snatching
at
things
and
if
you
please
you
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
do
put
your
hands
behind
you
if
i
see
you
make
the
least
movement
with
them
back
goes
the
will
into
my
pocket
if
pratt
had
looked
more
closely
at
her
just
then
he
would
have
taken
warning
from
the
sudden
flash
of
hatred
and
resentment
which
swept
across
mallathorpe
face
it
would
have
told
him
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
dangerous
woman
who
would
use
her
wits
to
circumvent
and
beat
him
if
not
now
then
later
but
he
was
moving
the
gas
bracket
over
the
mantelpiece
and
he
did
not
see
very
well
but
i
had
no
intention
of
touching
it
said
mallathorpe
all
i
want
is
to
see
it
and
read
it
she
obediently
followed
out
pratt
instructions
and
standing
in
front
of
her
he
produced
the
will
unfolded
it
and
held
it
at
a
convenient
distance
before
her
eyes
he
watched
her
closely
as
she
read
it
and
he
saw
her
grow
very
pale
take
your
time
read
it
over
two
or
three
times
he
said
quietly
get
it
well
into
your
mind
mrs
mallathorpe
she
nodded
her
head
at
last
and
pratt
stepped
back
folded
up
the
will
and
turning
to
a
heavy
box
which
lay
open
on
the
table
placed
it
within
under
lock
and
key
and
that
done
he
turned
back
and
took
a
chair
close
to
his
visitor
safe
there
mallathorpe
he
said
with
a
glance
that
was
both
reassuring
and
cunning
but
only
for
the
night
i
keep
a
few
securities
of
my
own
at
one
of
the
banks
in
the
town
never
mind
which
and
that
will
shall
be
deposited
with
them
tomorrow
morning
mallathorpe
shook
her
head
no
she
said
because
you
come
to
terms
with
me
pratt
shook
his
head
too
and
he
laughed
of
course
i
shall
come
to
terms
with
you
he
answered
but
they
be
my
terms
and
they
do
include
any
giving
up
of
that
document
flat
mrs
mallathorpe
not
if
i
make
it
worth
your
while
she
asked
listen
you
do
know
what
ready
money
i
can
command
ready
money
i
tell
you
cash
down
on
the
spot
i
a
pretty
good
notion
responded
pratt
it
generally
understood
in
the
town
that
your
son
a
mere
and
that
you
the
real
boss
of
the
whole
show
i
know
that
you
at
the
mill
four
times
a
week
and
that
the
managers
are
under
your
thumb
i
know
that
you
manage
everything
connected
with
the
estate
so
of
course
i
know
you
lots
of
ready
money
at
your
disposal
and
i
know
that
you
do
earn
more
than
four
or
five
pounds
a
week
at
the
outside
said
mallathorpe
quietly
come
now
just
think
what
a
nice
convenient
thing
it
would
be
to
a
young
man
of
your
age
to
have
a
capital
capital
it
would
be
the
making
of
you
you
could
go
right
away
to
london
say
and
start
out
on
whatever
you
liked
be
sensible
sell
me
that
paper
and
be
done
with
the
whole
thing
no
replied
pratt
mallathorpe
looked
at
him
for
a
full
moment
she
was
a
shrewd
judge
of
character
and
she
felt
that
pratt
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
hard
to
stir
from
a
position
once
adopted
but
she
had
to
make
her
effort
and
she
made
it
in
what
she
thought
the
most
effective
way
i
give
you
five
thousand
pounds
cash
for
it
she
said
meet
me
with
it
tomorrow
anywhere
you
like
in
the
town
any
time
you
like
and
i
hand
you
the
money
in
notes
no
said
pratt
no
once
more
she
looked
at
him
and
pratt
looked
back
and
smiled
when
i
say
no
i
mean
no
he
went
on
and
i
never
meant
more
firmly
than
i
do
now
i
do
believe
you
she
answered
affecting
a
doubt
which
she
certainly
did
not
feel
you
only
holding
out
for
more
money
if
i
were
holding
out
for
more
money
mallathorpe
replied
pratt
if
i
meant
to
sell
you
that
will
for
cash
payment
i
should
have
stated
my
terms
to
you
last
night
i
should
have
said
precisely
how
much
i
wanted
and
i
should
have
budged
from
the
amount
mrs
mallathorpe
it
no
good
i
got
my
own
schemes
and
my
own
ideas
and
i
going
to
carry
out
i
want
you
to
appoint
me
steward
to
your
property
your
affairs
for
life
life
she
exclaimed
life
my
life
answered
pratt
and
let
me
tell
you
you
find
me
a
man
a
good
faithful
honest
servant
i
do
well
by
you
and
yours
you
never
regret
it
as
long
as
you
live
it
be
the
best
day
work
you
ever
done
i
look
after
your
interests
everybody
interests
as
if
they
were
my
own
as
indeed
he
added
with
a
sly
glance
they
will
be
mallathorpe
realized
the
finality
the
resolve
in
all
this
but
she
made
one
more
attempt
ten
thousand
she
said
come
now
think
what
ten
thousand
pounds
in
cash
would
mean
to
you
no
nor
twenty
thousand
replied
pratt
i
made
up
my
mind
have
my
own
terms
it
no
use
not
one
bit
of
use
haggling
or
discussing
matters
further
i
in
possession
of
the
will
and
therefore
of
the
situation
mallathorpe
you
just
got
to
do
what
i
tell
you
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
going
over
to
a
took
from
it
a
some
writing
paper
and
a
pencil
for
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
and
again
he
did
not
see
the
look
of
almost
murderous
hatred
which
came
into
his
visitor
eyes
had
he
seen
and
understood
it
he
might
even
then
have
reconsidered
matters
and
taken
last
offer
but
the
look
had
gone
when
he
turned
again
and
he
noticed
nothing
as
he
handed
over
the
writing
materials
what
are
these
for
she
asked
you
see
in
a
moment
replied
pratt
reseating
himself
and
drawing
his
chair
a
little
nearer
her
own
now
listen
because
it
no
good
arguing
any
more
you
going
to
give
me
that
stewardship
and
agency
you
simply
tell
your
son
that
it
absolutely
necessary
to
have
a
steward
he
agree
if
he
does
no
matter
you
convince
him
now
then
we
must
do
it
in
a
fashion
that
wo
excite
any
suspicion
thus
in
a
few
days
say
next
week
you
insert
in
the
barford
papers
all
three
of
them
the
advertisement
i
going
to
dictate
to
you
we
put
it
in
the
usual
formal
phraseology
write
this
down
if
you
please
mrs
mallathorpe
he
dictated
an
advertisement
setting
forth
the
requirements
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
mallathorpe
obeyed
him
and
wrote
she
hated
pratt
more
than
ever
at
that
moment
there
was
a
quiet
steadfast
implacability
about
him
that
made
her
feel
helpless
but
she
restrained
all
sign
of
it
and
when
she
had
done
his
bidding
she
looked
at
him
as
calmly
as
he
looked
at
her
i
am
to
insert
this
in
the
barford
papers
next
week
she
said
and
what
then
then
you
get
a
lot
of
applications
for
the
job
chuckled
pratt
there
be
mine
amongst
them
you
can
throw
most
of
in
the
fire
keep
a
few
for
form
sake
profess
to
discuss
them
with
harper
but
let
the
discussion
be
all
on
your
side
i
send
two
or
three
good
testimonials
you
incline
to
me
from
the
first
you
send
for
me
your
interview
with
me
will
be
highly
satisfactory
and
you
give
me
the
appointment
and
your
terms
asked
mallathorpe
now
that
her
own
scheme
had
failed
she
seemed
quite
placable
to
all
pratt
proposals
a
sure
sign
of
danger
to
him
if
he
had
only
known
it
better
let
me
know
them
now
and
have
done
with
it
quite
so
agreed
pratt
but
first
of
all
can
you
keep
this
secret
to
yourself
and
me
the
money
part
any
way
i
can
and
shall
she
answered
good
said
pratt
very
well
i
want
a
thousand
a
year
also
i
want
two
rooms
and
a
business
room
at
the
grange
i
shall
not
interfere
with
you
or
your
family
or
your
domestic
arrangements
but
i
shall
expect
to
have
all
my
meals
served
to
me
from
your
kitchen
and
to
have
one
of
your
servants
at
my
disposal
i
know
the
grange
i
been
over
it
more
than
once
there
much
more
room
there
than
you
can
make
use
of
give
me
the
rooms
i
want
in
one
of
the
wings
i
sha
disturb
any
of
you
you
never
see
me
except
on
business
and
if
you
want
to
again
the
calm
acquiescence
which
would
have
surprised
some
men
why
pratt
failed
to
be
surprised
by
it
was
because
he
was
just
then
feeling
exceedingly
triumphant
he
believed
that
mallathorpe
was
metaphorically
at
his
feet
he
had
more
than
a
little
vanity
in
him
and
it
pleased
him
greatly
that
dictating
of
terms
he
saw
himself
a
conqueror
with
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
his
victim
is
that
all
then
asked
the
visitor
all
answered
pratt
mallathorpe
calmly
folded
up
the
draft
advertisement
and
placed
it
in
her
purse
then
she
rose
and
adjusted
her
veil
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
until
i
get
your

showed
her
out
and
walked
to
the
cab
with
her
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
highly
satisfied
and
utterly
ignorant
of
what
mallathorpe
was
thinking
as
she
drove
away
chapter
ix
until
next
spring
within
a
week
of
his
sudden
death
in
eldrick
private
office
old
antony
bartle
was
safely
laid
in
the
tomb
under
the
of
which
clough
had
spoken
with
such
appreciation
and
his
grandson
had
entered
into
virtual
possession
of
all
that
he
had
left
collingwood
found
little
difficulty
in
settling
his
grandfather
affairs
everything
had
been
left
to
him
he
was
sole
executor
as
well
as
sole
residuary
legatee
he
found
his
various
tasks
made
uncommonly
easy
another
bookseller
in
the
town
hurried
to
buy
the
entire
stock
and
business
goodwill
book
debts
everything
collingwood
was
free
of
all
responsibility
of
the
shop
in
quagg
alley
within
a
few
days
of
the
old
man
funeral
and
when
he
had
made
a
handsome
present
to
the
housekeeper
a
suitable
one
to
the
and
paid
his
last
debts
he
was
free
to
depart
a
richer
man
by
some
thousand
pounds
than
when
he
hurried
down
to
barford
in
response
to
eldrick
telegram
he
sat
in
eldrick
office
one
afternoon
winding
up
his
affairs
with
him
there
were
certain
things
that
eldrick
pascoe
would
have
to
do
as
for
himself
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
get
back
to
london
there
something
i
want
to
propose
to
you
said
eldrick
when
they
had
finished
the
immediate
business
you
going
to
practise
of
course
of
course
replied
collingwood
with
a
laugh
if
i
get
the
chance
you
get
the
chance
said
eldrick
what
were
you
going
in
for
commercial
law
company
law
as
a
special
thing
answered
collingwood
why
i
tell
you
what
it
is
continued
eldrick
eagerly
there
a
career
for
you
if
you
take
my
advice
leave
london
come
down
here
and
take
chambers
in
the
town
and
go
the
circuit
i
promise
you
for
our
firm
alone
plenty
of
work
you
get
more
there
lots
of
work
waiting
here
for
a
good
smart
young
barrister
ah
you
smile
but
i
know
what
i
talking
about
you
do
know
barford
men
they
believe
in
the
old
adage
that
one
should
look
at
home
before
going
abroad
they
terribly
litigious
too
and
if
you
were
here
on
the
spot
they
give
you
work
what
do
you
say
collingwood
that
sounds
very
tempting
but
i
was
thinking
of
sticking
to
london
not
one
hundredth
part
of
the
chance
in
london
that
there
is
here
affirmed
eldrick
we
badly
want
two
or
three
barristers
in
this
place
a
man
who
really
well
up
in
commercial
and
company
law
would
soon
have
his
hands
full
there
work
i
tell
you
take
my
advice
and
come
i
could
come
in
any
case
for
a
few
months
said
collingwood
musingly
of
course
if
you
really
think
there
an
opening
i
know
there
is
asserted
eldrick
i
guarantee
you
lots
of
work
our
work
i
sick
of
fetching
men
down
all
the
way
from
town
or
getting
them
from
leeds
come
and
you
see
i
might
come
in
a
few
months
time
and
try
things
for
a
year
or
two
replied
collingwood
but
i
off
to
india
you
know
next
week
and
i
shall
be
away
until
the
end
of
spring
four
months
or
so
to
india
exclaimed
eldrick
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
sir
john
standridge
said
collingwood
mentioning
a
famous
legal
luminary
of
the
day
is
going
out
to
hyderabad
to
take
certain
evidence
and
hold
a
sort
of
inquiry
in
a
big
case
and
i
going
with
him
as
his
secretary
and
assistant
i
was
in
his
chambers
for
two
years
you
know
we
leave
next
week
and
we
shall
not
be
back
until
the
end
of
april
lucky
man
remarked
the
solicitor
well
when
you
return
forget
what
i
said
come
back
you
not
regret
it
come
and
settle
down
you
not
engaged
are
you
engaged
said
collingwood
to
what
to
whom
what
do
you
mean
engaged
to
be
married
answered
eldrick
coolly
you
not
good
if
you
want
a
wife
there
miss
mallathorpe
nice
clever
girl
my
boy
and
no
end
of
what
barford
folk
call
brass
the
very
woman
for
you
do
you
barford
people
ever
think
of
anything
else
but
what
you
call
brass
asked
collingwood
laughing
sometimes
replied
eldrick
but
it
generally
of
something
that
nothing
but
brass
can
bring
or
produce
after
all
a
rich
wife
is
a
despicable
thing
nowadays
you
seen
this
young
lady
i
been
there
once
asserted
collingwood
go
again
before
you
leave
counselled
eldrick
you
just
the
right
man
listen
to
the
counsels
of
the
wise
and
while
you
in
india
think
well
over
my
other
advice
i
tell
you
there
a
career
for
you
here
in
the
north
that
you
never
get
in
town
collingwood
left
him
and
went
out
to
find
a
motorcar
and
drive
off
to
normandale
grange
not
because
eldrick
had
advised
him
to
go
but
because
of
his
promise
to
harper
and
nesta
mallathorpe
and
once
more
he
found
nesta
alone
and
though
he
had
no
spice
of
vanity
in
his
composition
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
glad
when
he
walked
into
the
room
in
which
they
had
first
met
my
mother
is
out
gone
to
town
to
the
mill
she
said
and
harper
is
knocking
around
the
park
with
a
gun
killing
rabbits
and
time
he
be
in
presently
to
tea
and
he
be
delighted
to
see
you
are
you
going
to
stay
in
barford
much
longer
i
going
up
to
town
this
evening
seven
train
answered
collingwood
watching
her
keenly
all
my
business
is
finished
now
for
the
present
but
you
be
coming
back
she
asked
perhaps
he
said
i
may
come
back
after
a
while
when
you
do
come
back
she
went
on
a
little
hurriedly
will
you
come
and
see
us
again
i
it
difficult
to
explain
but
i
do
wish
harper
knew
more
men
the
right
sort
of
men
do
you
understand
you
mean
he
needs
more
company
more
company
of
the
right
kind
he
does
know
many
nice
men
and
he
has
so
little
to
occupy
him
he
no
head
for
business
my
mother
attends
to
all
that
and
he
does
care
much
about
sport
and
when
he
goes
into
barford
he
only
hangs
about
the
club
and
i
afraid
at
two
or
three
of
the
hotels
there
and
it
not
good
for
him
ca
you
get
him
interested
in
anything
suggested
collingwood
is
there
nothing
that
he
cares
about
he
never
did
care
about
anything
replied
nesta
with
a
sigh
apathetic
he
just
moves
along
sometimes
i
think
he
was
born
half
asleep
and
he
never
been
really
awakened
pity
is
it
considering
everything
a
great
pity
agreed
collingwood
but
provided
for
nesta
gave
him
a
swift
glance
it
might
have
been
a
good
deal
better
for
him
if
he
had
been
provided
for
she
said
he
have
just
had
to
do
something
then
but
if
you
come
back
you
come
here
sometimes
of
course
answered
collingwood
and
if
i
come
back
it
will
probably
be
to
stop
here
eldrick
says
there
a
lot
of
work
going
begging
in
barford
for
a
smart
young
barrister
well
up
in
commercial
law
perhaps
i
may
try
to
come
up
to
his
standard
i
certainly
young
but
i
know
whether
i
smart
better
come
and
try
she
said
smiling
do
forget
that
i
seen
you
look
the
part
anyway
your
wig
and
gown
suited
you
very
well
theatrical
properties
he
replied
laughing
the
wig
was
too
small
and
the
gown
too
long
well
we
see
but
in
the
meantime
i
going
away
for
four
months
to
india
to
india
four
months
she
exclaimed
that
sounds
nice
legal
business
said
collingwood
i
shall
be
back
about
the
end
of
april
and
then
i
shall
probably
come
down
here
again
and
seriously
consider
eldrick
suggestion
i
very
much
inclined
to
take
it
then
you
leave
london
she
asked
i
little
to
leave
there
replied
collingwood
my
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
i
no
brothers
no
sisters
no
very
near
relations
sounds
lonely
does
it
one
can
feel
lonely
when
one
has
relations
said
nesta
are
you
saying
that
from
experience
he
asked
i
often
wish
i
had
more
to
do
she
answered
frankly
what
the
use
of
denying
it
i
next
to
nothing
to
do
here
i
liked
my
work
at
the
hospital
i
was
busy
all
day
here
if
i
were
you
interrupted
collingwood
i
set
to
work
nursing
in
another
fashion
look
after
your
brother
get
him
going
at
something
even
if
it
playing
golf
play
with
him
it
would
do
him
and
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
if
you
got
thoroughly
infatuated
with
even
a
game
do
you
see
you
mean
anything
is
better
than
nothing
she
replied
all
right
i
try
that
anyway
for
i
anxious
about
harper
all
this
money
and
no
occupation
collingwood
who
was
sitting
near
the
windows
looked
out
across
the
park
and
into
the
valley
beyond
i
should
have
thought
that
a
man
who
had
come
into
an
estate
like
this
would
have
found
plenty
of
occupation
he
remarked
what
is
there
beside
the
house
and
this
park
nesta
who
had
busied
herself
with
some
since
entrance
laid
it
down
and
came
to
the
windows
she
pointed
to
certain
roofs
and
gables
in
the
valley
there
the
whole
village
of
normandale
she
said
a
busy
place
no
doubt
but
it
all
harper
he
lord
of
the
manor
he
patron
of
the
living
too
it
all
his
farms
cottages
everything
and
the
woods
and
the
park
and
this
house
and
a
stretch
of
the
moors
as
well
of
course
he
ought
to
find
a
lot
to
do
but
he
does
perhaps
because
my
mother
does
everything
she
really
is
a
business
woman
collingwood
looked
out
over
the
area
which
nesta
had
indicated
harper
mallathorpe
he
calculated
must
be
possessed
of
some
three
or
four
thousand
acres
a
fine
property
he
said
he
a
very
fortunate
fellow
just
then
this
very
fortunate
fellow
came
in
his
face
dull
enough
as
he
entered
lighted
up
at
sight
of
a
visitor
and
fell
again
when
collingwood
explained
that
his
visit
was
a
mere
flying
one
and
that
he
was
returning
to
london
that
night
collingwood
led
him
on
to
the
project
which
he
had
mentioned
at
his
previous
visit
the
making
of
golf
links
in
the
park
and
pointed
out
as
a
devotee
of
the
sport
what
a
fine
course
could
be
made
before
he
left
he
had
succeeded
in
arousing
like
interest
in
harper
he
promised
to
go
into
the
matter
and
to
employ
a
man
whom
collingwood
recommended
as
an
expert
in
laying
out
golf
courses
you
have
got
your
greens
in
something
like
order
by
this
time
next
year
if
you
start
operations
soon
said
collingwood
and
then
if
i
settle
down
at
barford
i
come
out
now
and
then
if
you
let
me
let
you
exclaimed
harper
by
jove
we
only
too
glad
to
have
anybody
out
here
are
we
nesta
we
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
collingwood
said
nesta
collingwood
went
away
with
that
last
intimation
warm
in
his
memory
he
had
an
idea
that
the
girl
meant
what
she
said
and
for
a
moment
he
was
sorry
that
he
was
going
to
india
he
might
have
settled
down
at
barford
there
and
then
and
but
at
that
he
laughed
at
himself
a
young
woman
with
several
thousands
a
year
of
her
own
he
said
of
course
she
marry
some
big
pot
in
the
county
they
feel
a
little
lonely
those
two
just
now
because
everything
new
to
them
and
they
new
to
their
changed
circumstances
but
when
i
get
back
ah
i
guess
they
have
got
plenty
of
people
around
them
and
he
determined
being
a
young
man
of
sense
not
to
think
any
more
for
already
he
had
thought
a
good
deal
of
nesta
mallathorpe
until
he
returned
from
his
indian
travels
let
him
attend
to
his
business
and
leave
possibilities
until
they
came
nearer
all
the
same
he
mused
as
he
drew
near
the
town
again
i
pretty
sure
i
shall
come
back
here
next
spring
i
feel
like
it
he
called
in
at
eldrick
office
on
his
way
to
the
hotel
to
take
some
documents
which
had
been
preparing
for
him
it
was
then
late
in
the
afternoon
and
no
one
but
pratt
was
there
pratt
indeed
had
been
waiting
until
collingwood
called
going
back
to
town
mr
collingwood
asked
pratt
as
he
handed
over
a
big
envelope
when
shall
we
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
sir
something
in
the
clerk
tone
made
collingwood
think
he
could
not
tell
why
that
pratt
was
fishing
for
information
and
also
for
reasons
which
he
could
not
explain
collingwood
had
taken
a
curious
dislike
to
pratt
and
was
not
inclined
to
give
him
any
confidence
i
do
know
he
answered
a
little
icily
i
am
leaving
for
india
next
week
he
bade
the
clerk
a
formal
farewell
and
went
off
and
pratt
locked
the
office
door
and
slowly
followed
him
downstairs
to
india
he
said
to
himself
watching
the
young
retreating
figure
to
india
eh
for
a
time
or
for
what
anyway
that
was
good
news
pratt
had
seen
in
collingwood
a
possible
rival
chapter
x
the
collingwood
return
to
london
was
made
on
a
friday
evening
next
day
he
began
the
final
preparations
for
his
departure
to
india
on
the
following
thursday
he
was
looking
forward
to
his
journey
and
his
stay
in
india
with
keen
expectation
he
would
have
the
society
of
a
particularly
clever
and
brilliant
man
they
were
to
break
their
journey
in
italy
and
in
egypt
he
would
enjoy
exceptional
facilities
for
seeing
the
native
life
of
india
he
would
gain
valuable
experience
it
was
a
chance
at
which
any
young
man
would
have
jumped
and
collingwood
had
been
greatly
envied
when
it
was
known
that
sir
john
standridge
had
offered
it
to
him
and
yet
he
was
conscious
that
if
he
could
have
done
precisely
what
he
desired
he
would
have
stayed
longer
at
barford
in
order
to
see
more
of
nesta
mallathorpe
already
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
the
coming
spring
when
he
would
be
back
and
free
to
go
north
again
but
collingwood
was
fated
to
go
north
once
more
much
sooner
than
he
had
dreamed
of
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
in
his
rooms
on
the
monday
morning
after
his
departure
from
barford
turning
over
his
newspaper
with
no
particular
aim
or
interest
his
attention
was
suddenly
and
sharply
arrested
by
a
headline
even
that
headline
might
not
have
led
him
to
read
what
lay
beneath
but
in
the
same
instant
in
which
he
saw
it
he
also
saw
a
name
mallathorpe
in
the
next
he
knew
that
heavy
trouble
had
fallen
on
normandale
grange
the
very
day
after
he
had
left
it
this
is
what
collingwood
read
as
he
sat
in
one
hand
newspaper
in
the
other
staring
at
the
lines
of
unleaded
type
tragic
fate
of
young
yorkshire
squire
a
fatal
accident
of
a
particularly
sad
and
disturbing
nature
occurred
near
barford
yorkshire
on
saturday
about
four
on
saturday
afternoon
linford
pratt
managing
clerk
to
eldrick
pascoe
solicitors
of
barford
who
was
crossing
the
grounds
of
normandale
grange
on
his
way
to
a
business
appointment
discovered
the
dead
body
of
mallathorpe
the
owner
of
the
normandale
estate
lying
in
a
roadway
which
at
that
point
is
spanned
forty
feet
above
by
a
narrow
the
latter
is
an
ancient
construction
of
wood
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
in
extremely
bad
repair
and
had
given
way
when
the
unfortunate
young
gentleman
who
was
out
shooting
in
his
park
stepped
upon
it
mallathorpe
who
was
only
years
of
age
succeeded
to
the
normandale
estates
one
of
the
finest
properties
in
the
neighbourhood
of
barford
about
two
years
ago
under
somewhat
romantic
and
also
tragic
circumstances
their
previous
owner
his
uncle
john
mallathorpe
a
barford
manufacturer
meeting
a
sudden
death
by
the
falling
of
his
mill
chimney
a
catastrophe
which
also
caused
the
deaths
of
several
of
his
employees
john
mallathorpe
died
intestate
and
the
estate
at
normandale
passed
to
the
young
gentleman
who
met
such
a
sad
fate
on
saturday
afternoon
mallathorpe
was
unmarried
and
it
is
understood
that
normandale
which
includes
the
village
of
that
name
the
advowson
of
the
living
and
about
four
thousand
acres
of
land
now
becomes
the
property
of
his
sister
miss
nesta
mallathorpe
collingwood
set
down
his
cup
and
dropped
the
newspaper
he
was
but
half
way
through
his
breakfast
but
all
his
appetite
had
vanished
all
that
he
was
conscious
of
was
that
here
was
trouble
and
grief
for
a
girl
in
whom
it
was
useless
to
deny
it
he
had
already
begun
to
take
a
warm
interest
and
suddenly
he
started
from
his
chair
and
snatched
up
a
railway
guide
as
he
turned
over
its
pages
he
thought
rapidly
the
preparations
for
his
journey
to
india
were
almost
finished
what
was
not
done
he
could
do
in
a
few
hours
he
had
no
further
appointment
with
sir
john
standridge
until
nine
on
thursday
morning
when
he
was
to
meet
him
at
the
train
for
dover
and
paris
monday
tuesday
wednesday
he
had
three
days
ample
time
to
hurry
down
to
normandale
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
there
and
to
get
back
in
time
to
make
his
own
last
arrangements
he
glanced
at
his
watch
he
had
forty
minutes
in
which
to
catch
an
express
from
king
cross
to
barford
without
further
delay
he
picked
up
a
which
was
already
packed
and
set
out
for
the
station
he
was
in
barford
soon
after
two
in
eldrick
office
by
two
eldrick
shook
his
head
at
sight
of
him
i
can
guess
what
brought
you
down
collingwood
he
said
good
of
you
of
course
i
do
think
they
many
friends
out
there
i
can
scarcely
call
myself
that
yet
answered
collingwood
but
i
thought
i
might
be
of
some
use
i
drive
out
there
presently
but
first
how
was
it
eldrick
shook
his
head
do
know
much
more
than
what
the
papers
say
he
answered
an
old
there
that
spans
a
road
in
the
park
road
cut
through
a
ravine
they
say
it
was
absolutely
rotten
and
the
poor
chap
weight
was
evidently
too
much
for
it
and
there
was
a
drop
of
forty
feet
into
a
hard
road
extraordinary
thing
that
nobody
on
the
estate
seems
to
have
known
of
the
dangerous
condition
of
that
bridge
but
they
say
it
was
little
used
simply
a
link
between
one
plantation
and
another
however
it
done
now
our
clerk
pratt
you
know
found
the
body
had
been
dead
five
minutes
pratt
says
what
was
pratt
doing
there
asked
collingwood
oh
business
of
his
own
replied
eldrick
not
ours
there
was
an
advertisement
in
saturday
papers
which
set
out
that
a
steward
was
wanted
for
the
normandale
estate
and
pratt
mentioned
it
to
me
in
the
morning
that
he
thought
of
applying
for
the
job
if
we
give
him
a
good
testimonial
i
suppose
he
gone
out
there
to
see
about
the
preliminaries
anyway
he
was
walking
through
the
park
when
he
found
young
mallathorpe
body
i
understand
he
made
himself
very
useful
too
and
i
sent
him
out
there
again
today
to
do
anything
he
can
smart
chap
pratt
possibly
then
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
remarked
collingwood
i
should
say
you
do
a
lot
by
merely
going
there
answered
eldrick
as
i
said
just
now
they
few
friends
and
no
relations
and
i
hear
that
mallathorpe
is
absolutely
knocked
over
go
by
all
means
a
bit
of
sympathy
goes
a
long
way
on
these
occasions
i
say
what
a
regular
transformation
an
affair
of
this
sort
produces
do
you
know
that
young
fellow
just
like
his
uncle
had
not
made
any
will
fact
i
had
it
from
robson
their
solicitor
this
very
morning
the
whole
of
the
estate
comes
to
the
sister
of
course
she
and
the
mother
will
share
the
personal
property
by
that
lad
death
nesta
mallathorpe
becomes
one
of
the
wealthiest
young
women
in
yorkshire
collingwood
made
no
reply
to
this
communication
but
as
he
drove
off
to
normandale
grange
it
was
fresh
in
his
mind
and
it
was
not
very
pleasant
to
him
one
of
the
wealthiest
young
women
in
yorkshire
and
he
was
already
realizing
that
he
would
like
to
make
nesta
mallathorpe
his
wife
it
was
because
he
felt
what
he
did
for
her
that
he
had
rushed
down
to
do
anything
he
could
that
would
be
of
help
supposing
only
supposing
that
people
anybody
said
that
he
was
somewhat
unduly
sensitive
proud
almost
to
a
fault
he
felt
his
cheek
redden
at
the
thought
and
for
a
moment
he
wished
that
old
john
mallathorpe
wealth
had
never
passed
to
his
niece
but
then
he
sneered
at
himself
for
his
presumption
ass
he
said
she
never
even
thought
of
me
in
that
way
most
likely
anyway
i
a
stupid
fool
for
thinking
of
these
things
at
present
but
he
knew
within
a
few
minutes
of
entering
the
big
house
that
nesta
had
been
thinking
of
him
she
came
to
him
in
the
room
where
they
had
first
met
and
quietly
gave
him
her
hand
i
was
not
surprised
when
they
told
me
you
were
here
she
said
i
was
thinking
about
you
or
rather
expecting
to
hear
from
you
i
came
at
once
answered
collingwood
who
had
kept
her
hand
in
his
i
well
i
could
stop
away
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
do
something
be
of
some
use
it
a
great
deal
of
use
to
have
just
come
she
said
thank
you
but
i
suppose
you
have
to
go
not
for
two
days
anyway
he
replied
what
can
i
do
i
do
know
that
you
can
actually
do
anything
she
answered
everything
is
being
done
eldrick
sent
his
clerk
pratt
who
found
harper
he
been
most
kind
and
useful
he
and
our
own
solicitor
are
making
all
arrangements
there
got
to
be
an
inquest
no
i
do
know
that
you
can
do
actual
things
but
while
here
you
can
look
in
when
you
like
my
mother
is
very
ill
she
has
scarcely
spoken
since
saturday
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
said
collingwood
determinedly
i
noticed
in
coming
through
the
village
just
now
that
there
quite
a
decent
inn
there
i
go
down
and
arrange
to
stay
there
until
wednesday
evening
then
i
shall
be
close
by
if
you
should
need
me
he
saw
by
her
look
of
quick
appreciation
and
relief
that
this
suggestion
pleased
her
she
pressed
his
hand
and
withdrew
her
own
thank
you
again
she
said
do
you
know
i
ca
quite
explain
i
should
be
glad
if
you
were
close
at
hand
everybody
has
been
very
kind
but
i
do
feel
that
there
is
nobody
i
can
talk
to
if
you
arrange
this
will
you
come
in
again
this
evening
i
shall
arrange
it
answered
collingwood
i
see
to
it
now
tell
your
people
i
am
to
be
brought
in
whenever
i
call
and
i
be
close
by
whenever
you
want
me
it
seemed
little
to
say
little
to
do
but
he
left
her
feeling
that
he
was
being
of
some
use
and
as
he
went
off
to
make
his
arrangements
at
the
inn
he
encountered
pratt
who
was
talking
to
the
butler
in
the
outer
hall
the
clerk
looked
at
collingwood
with
an
unconcern
and
a
composure
which
he
was
able
to
assume
because
he
had
already
heard
of
his
presence
in
the
house
inwardly
he
was
malignantly
angry
that
the
young
barrister
was
there
but
his
voice
was
suave
and
polite
enough
when
he
spoke
good
afternoon
collingwood
he
said
quietly
very
sad
occasion
on
which
we
meet
again
sir
come
to
offer
your
sympathy
collingwood
of
course
very
kind
of
you
i
came
answered
collingwood
who
was
not
inclined
to
bandy
phrases
with
pratt
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
practical
use
just
so
sir
said
pratt
eldrick
sent
me
here
for
the
same
purpose
there
really
not
much
to
do
beyond
the
necessary
arrangements
which
are
already
pretty
forward
going
back
to
town
sir
he
went
on
following
collingwood
out
to
his
which
stood
waiting
in
the
drive
no
replied
collingwood
i
going
to
send
this
man
to
barford
to
fetch
my
bag
to
the
inn
down
there
in
the
village
where
i
going
to
stay
for
a
few
days
did
you
hear
that
he
continued
turning
to
the
driver
go
back
to
barford
get
my
bag
from
the
there
bring
it
to
the
i
meet
you
there
on
your
return
the
car
went
off
and
collingwood
with
a
nod
to
pratt
was
about
to
turn
down
a
side
path
towards
the
village
but
pratt
stopped
him
would
you
care
to
see
the
place
where
the
accident
happened
mr
collingwood
he
said
it
close
by
wo
take
five
minutes
collingwood
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
turned
back
it
might
be
well
he
reflected
if
he
made
himself
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case
simple
as
they
seemed
thank
you
he
said
if
it
so
near
this
way
sir
responded
pratt
he
led
his
companion
along
the
front
of
the
house
through
the
shrubberies
at
the
end
of
a
wing
and
into
a
plantation
by
a
path
thickly
covered
with
pine
needles
presently
they
emerged
upon
a
similar
track
at
right
angles
to
that
by
which
they
had
come
and
leading
into
a
denser
part
of
the
woods
and
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
yards
of
it
they
came
to
a
barricade
evidently
of
recent
construction
over
which
pratt
stretched
a
hand
there
he
said
that
the
bridge
sir
collingwood
looked
over
the
barricade
he
saw
that
he
and
pratt
were
standing
at
the
edge
of
one
thick
plantation
of
fir
and
pine
the
edge
of
a
similar
plantation
stretched
before
them
some
ten
yards
away
but
between
the
two
lay
a
deep
dark
ravine
which
immediately
in
front
of
the
temporary
barricade
was
spanned
by
a
narrow
rustic
bridge
a
thing
of
planks
railed
in
by
boughs
of
trees
and
in
the
middle
was
a
jagged
gap
in
both
floor
and
showing
where
the
rotten
wood
had
given
way
i
explain
collingwood
said
the
clerk
presently
i
knew
this
park
sir
i
knew
it
well
before
the
late
john
mallathorpe
bought
the
property
that
path
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
makes
a
short
cut
down
to
the
station
in
the
valley
through
the
woods
and
the
lower
part
of
the
park
i
came
up
that
path
from
the
station
on
saturday
afternoon
intending
to
cross
this
bridge
and
go
on
to
the
house
where
i
had
private
business
when
i
got
to
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
there
i
saw
the
gap
in
the
middle
and
then
i
looked
down
into
the
cut
there
a
road
a
paved
road
down
there
and
i
saw
him
and
so
i
made
shift
to
scramble
down
stiff
job
it
was
to
get
to
him
but
he
was
dead
collingwood
stone
dead
sir
though
i
certain
he
had
been
dead
five
minutes
and
aye
an
he
never
ha
been
dead
at
all
would
young
squire
if
only
his
ma
had
listened
to
what
i
telled
her
interrupted
a
voice
behind
them
he
ha
been
alive
at
this
minute
he
would
if
his
ma
had
done
what
i
said
owt
to
be
done
now
then
collingwood
turned
sharply
to
confront
an
old
man
evidently
one
of
the
woodmen
on
the
estate
who
had
come
up
behind
them
unheard
on
the
thick
carpeting
of
pine
needles
and
pratt
turned
too
with
a
keen
look
and
a
direct
question
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
what
are

about

answered
the
woodman
an
mallathorpe
she
said
she
hev
it
seen
to
it
should
ha
been
closed
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
went
off
amongst
the
trees
and
pratt
giving
his
vanishing
figure
a
queer
look
turned
silently
back
along
the
path
followed
by
collingwood
at
the
point
where
the
other
path
led
to
the
house
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
young
barrister
if
you
keep
straight
on
collingwood
he
said
you
get
straight
down
to
the
village
and
the
inn
i
must
go
this
way
he
went
off
rapidly
and
collingwood
walked
on
through
the
plantation
towards
the
wondering
all
the
way
why
pratt
was
so
anxious
to
know
exactly
when
it
was
that
mallathorpe
had
been
warned
about
the
old
bridge
chapter
xi
the
prevalent
atmosphere
until
that
afternoon
collingwood
had
never
been
in
the
village
to
which
he
was
now
bending
his
steps
on
that
and
his
previous
visits
to
the
grange
he
had
only
passed
the
end
of
its
one
street
now
descending
into
it
from
the
slopes
of
the
park
he
found
it
to
be
little
more
than
a
hamlet
a
church
a
farmstead
or
two
a
few
cottages
in
their
gardens
all
clustering
about
a
narrow
stream
spanned
by
a
bridge
of
stone
the
a
roomy
place
stood
at
one
end
of
the
bridge
and
from
the
windows
of
the
room
into
which
collingwood
was
presently
shown
he
could
look
out
on
the
stream
itself
and
on
the
meadows
beyond
it
a
peaceful
pretty
quiet
place
but
the
gloom
which
was
heavy
at
the
big
house
or
the
hill
seemed
to
have
spread
to
everybody
that
he
encountered
bad
job
this
sir
said
the
landlord
an
elderly
man
to
whom
collingwood
had
made
known
his
wants
and
who
had
quickly
formed
the
opinion
that
his
guest
was
of
the
legal
profession
and
a
queer
one
too
odd
thing
sir
that
our
old
squire
and
now
the
young
one
should
both
have
met
their
deaths
in
what
you
might
term
violent
fashion
accident
in
both
cases
remarked
collingwood
the
landlord
nodded
his
head
and
then
shook
it
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
while
he
agreed
with
this
proposition
in
one
respect
he
entertained
some
sort
of
doubt
about
it
in
others
ay
well
he
answered
of
course
a
mill
chimney
falling
without
notice
as
it
were
and
a
bridge
giving
way
them
accidents
to
be
sure
but
it
a
very
strange
thing
about
this
up
yonder
at
the
grange
very
strange
indeed
there
queer
talk
about
it
already
what
sort
of
talk
asked
collingwood
ever
since
the
old
woodman
had
come
up
to
him
and
pratt
as
they
stood
looking
at
the
he
had
been
aware
of
a
curious
sense
of
mystery
and
the
landlord
remark
tended
to
deepen
it
what
are
people
talking
about
nay
it
only
one
or
two
replied
the
landlord
there
been
two
men
in
here
since
the
affair
happened
that
crossed
that
bridge
friday
afternoon
and
both
of
big
heavy
men
according
to
what
one
can
learn
that
there
bridge
was
used
much
by
the
grange
people
it
led
to
nowhere
in
particular
for
them
but
there
is
a
right
of
way
across
that
part
of
the
park
and
these
two
men
as
i
speaking
of
they
made
use
of
it
on
friday
getting
towards
dark
i
know
well
they
both
of
weigh
four
times
as
much
together
as
young
squire
mallathorpe
and
yet
it
did
give
way
under
them
and
then
only
a
few
hours
later
as
you
might
say
down
it
goes
with
him
i
do
think
you
can
form
any
opinion
from
that
said
collingwood
these
things
these
old
structures
often
give
way
quite
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
ay
well
they
did
admit
these
men
too
that
it
seemed
a
bit
tottery
like
remarked
the
landlord
talking
it
over
between
themselves
in
here
they
agreed
to
be
sure
that
it
felt
to
give
a
bit
all
the
same
there
them
as
says
that
it
a
queer
thing
it
should
ha
given
altogether
when
young
squire
walked
on
it
collingwood
clinched
matters
with
a
straight
question
you
do
mean
to
say
that
people
are
suggesting
that
the
had
been
tampered
with
he
asked
there
is
them
about
as
would
be
slow
to
say
as
much
answered
the
landlord
folks
will
talk
you
see
sir
nobody
saw
what
happened
and
when
country
folk
does
see
what
takes
place
with
their
own
eyes
then
they
make
mysteries
out
of
it
interrupted
collingwood
a
little
impatiently
i
do
think
there
any
mystery
here
landlord
i
understood
that
this
was
in
a
very
unsafe
condition
no
afraid
the
whole
affair
was
only
too
simple
but
he
was
conscious
as
he
said
this
that
he
was
not
precisely
voicing
his
own
sentiments
he
himself
was
mystified
he
was
still
wondering
why
pratt
had
been
so
pertinacious
in
asking
the
old
woodman
when
precisely
he
had
told
mallathorpe
about
the
unsafe
condition
of
the
bridge
still
wondering
about
a
certain
expression
which
had
come
into
pratt
face
when
the
old
man
told
them
what
he
did
still
wondering
at
the
queer
look
which
pratt
had
given
the
information
as
he
went
off
into
the
plantation
was
there
then
something
some
secret
which
was
being
kept
back
by
somebody
he
was
still
pondering
over
these
things
when
he
went
back
to
the
grange
later
in
the
evening
but
he
was
resolved
not
to
say
anything
about
them
to
nesta
and
he
saw
nesta
only
for
a
few
minutes
her
mother
she
said
was
very
ill
indeed
the
doctor
was
with
her
then
and
she
must
go
back
to
them
since
her
son
death
mallathorpe
had
scarcely
spoken
and
the
doctor
knowing
that
her
heart
was
not
strong
was
somewhat
afraid
of
a
collapse
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
or
if
you
should
want
me
during
the
night
said
collingwood
earnestly
promise
me
that
you
send
at
once
to
the
inn
yes
answered
nesta
i
will
but
i
do
think
there
will
be
any
need
we
have
two
nurses
here
and
the
doctor
will
stop
there
is
something
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
do
tomorrow
she
went
on
looking
at
him
a
little
wistfully
you
know
about
the
inquest
yes
said
collingwood
they
say
we
that
is
i
because
of
course
my
mother
could
that
i
need
not
be
present
she
continued
robson
our
solicitor
says
it
will
be
a
very
short
formal
affair
he
will
be
there
of
course
but
would
you
mind
being
there
too
so
that
you
can
afterwards
tell
me
all
about
it
will
you
tell
me
something
straight
out
answered
collingwood
looking
intently
at
her
have
you
any
doubt
of
any
description
about
the
accepted
story
of
your
brother
death
be
plain
with
me
nesta
hesitated
for
awhile
before
answering
not
of
the
actual
circumstances
she
replied
at
last
none
at
all
of
what
you
call
the
accepted
story
the
fact
is
i
not
a
good
hand
at
explaining
anything
and
perhaps
i
ca
convey
to
you
what
i
mean
but
i
a
feeling
an
impression
that
there
is
or
was
some
mystery
on
saturday
which
might
have
and
might
not
have
oh
i
ca
make
it
clear
even
to
myself
if
you
would
be
at
the
inquest
tomorrow
and
listen
carefully
to
everything
and
then
tell
me
afterwards
do
you
understand
i
understand
answered
collingwood
leave
it
to
me
whether
he
expected
to
hear
anything
unusual
at
the
inquest
whether
he
thought
any
stray
word
hint
or
suggestion
would
come
up
during
the
proceedings
collingwood
was
no
more
aware
than
nesta
was
certain
of
her
vague
ideas
but
he
was
very
soon
assured
that
there
was
going
to
be
nothing
beyond
brevity
and
formality
he
had
never
previously
been
present
at
an
inquest
his
legal
mind
was
somewhat
astonished
at
the
way
in
which
things
were
done
it
was
quickly
evident
to
him
that
the
twelve
good
men
and
true
of
the
jury
most
of
them
cottagers
and
labourers
living
on
the
estate
were
quite
content
to
abide
by
the
directions
of
the
coroner
a
barford
solicitor
whose
one
idea
seemed
to
be
to
get
through
the
proceedings
as
rapidly
and
smoothly
as
possible
and
collingwood
felt
bound
to
admit
that
taking
the
evidence
as
it
was
brought
forward
no
simpler
or
more
straightforward
cause
of
investigation
could
be
adduced
it
was
all
very
simple
indeed
as
it
appeared
there
and
then
the
butler
a
respectable
type
of
the
old
family
spoke
as
to
his
identification
of
the
dead
master
body
and
gave
his
evidence
in
a
few
sentences
mallathorpe
he
said
had
gone
out
of
the
front
door
of
the
grange
at
two
on
saturday
afternoon
carrying
a
gun
and
had
turned
into
the
road
leading
towards
the
south
shrubbery
at
about
three
pratt
had
come
running
up
the
drive
to
the
house
and
told
him
and
miss
mallathorpe
that
he
had
just
found
mallathorpe
lying
dead
in
the
sunken
cut
between
the
south
and
north
shrubbery
nobody
had
any
question
to
ask
the
butler
nor
were
any
questions
asked
of
pratt
the
one
really
important
witness
pratt
gave
his
evidence
tersely
and
admirably
on
saturday
morning
he
had
seen
an
advertisement
in
the
barford
newspapers
which
stated
that
a
steward
and
agent
was
wanted
for
the
normandale
estate
and
all
applications
were
to
be
made
to
mallathorpe
desirous
of
applying
for
the
post
he
had
written
out
a
formal
letter
during
saturday
morning
had
obtained
a
testimonial
from
his
present
employers
eldrick
pascoe
and
anxious
to
present
his
application
as
soon
as
possible
had
decided
to
take
it
to
normandale
grange
himself
that
afternoon
he
had
left
barford
by
the
two
train
which
arrived
at
normandale
at
knowing
the
district
well
he
had
taken
the
path
through
the
plantations
arrived
at
the
he
had
at
once
noticed
that
part
of
it
had
fallen
in
looking
into
the
cutting
he
had
seen
a
man
lying
in
the
roadway
beneath
motionless
he
had
scrambled
down
the
side
of
the
cutting
discovered
that
the
man
was
harper
mallathorpe
and
that
he
was
dead
and
had
immediately
hurried
up
the
road
to
the
house
where
he
had
informed
the
last
witness
and
miss
mallathorpe
a
quite
plain
story
evidently
thought
everybody
no
questions
needed
nor
were
there
any
questions
needed
in
the
case
of
the
only
other
witnesses
the
estate
carpenter
who
said
that
the
was
very
old
but
that
he
had
not
been
aware
that
it
was
in
quite
so
bad
a
condition
and
who
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
recent
heavy
rains
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
matter
and
the
doctor
who
testified
that
the
victim
had
suffered
injuries
which
would
produce
absolutely
instantaneous
death
a
clear
case
nothing
could
be
clearer
said
the
coroner
to
his
obedient
jury
who
presently
returned
the
only
verdict
one
of
accidental
death
which
on
the
evidence
was
possible
collingwood
heard
no
comments
on
the
inquest
from
those
who
were
present
but
that
evening
as
he
sat
in
his
parlour
at
the
the
landlord
coming
in
on
pretence
of
attending
to
the
fire
approached
him
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
regions
which
he
had
just
quitted
you
remember
what
we
were
talking
of
this
afternoon
when
you
come
in
sir
he
whispered
there
some
of
regular
nightly
customers
village
folk
you
understand
talking
of
the
same
thing
now
and
of
this
here
inquest
and
if
you
like
to
hear
a
bit
of
what
you
may
call
local
opinion
and
especially
one
man
i
put
you
where
you
can
hear
it
without
being
seen
it
worth
hearing
anyway
collingwood
curious
to
know
what
the
village
wiseacres
had
to
say
rose
and
followed
the
landlord
into
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
an
open
hatchment
in
the
wall
covered
by
a
thin
curtain
allowed
him
to
hear
every
word
which
came
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
full
company
but
it
was
quickly
evident
that
in
that
company
there
was
one
man
who
either
was
or
wished
to
be
dictator
and
artifex
a
man
of
loud
voice
and
domineering
tone
who
was
laying
down
the
law
to
the
accompaniment
of
vigorous
thumpings
of
the
table
at
which
he
sat
what
i
say
is
and
i
say
it
agen
reckon
nowt
at
all
o
crowners
quests
he
was
affirming
as
collingwood
and
his
guide
drew
near
the
curtained
opening
what
is
a
crowner
quest
anyway
it
nowt
but
formality
all
form
and
show
it
means
nowt
all
them
sits
on
t
jury
does
and
says
just
what
t
crowner
tells
to
say
and
do
they
nivver
ax
no
questions
out
o
their
own
mouths
they
as
dumb
as
sheep
that
what
yon
jury
wor
this
mornin
now
then
that
james
stringer
the
blacksmith
whispered
the
landlord
coming
close
to
collingwood
elbow
he
thinks
he
knows
everything
and
pray
what
would
you
ha
done
mestur
stringer
if
you
been
on
yon
jury
inquired
a
milder
voice
i
suppose
ye
ha
wanted
to
know
a
bit
more
what
mestur
stringer
ha
wanted
to
know
a
deal
more
observed
another
voice
he
would
do
there
a
many
things
i
want
to
know
continued
the
blacksmith
with
a
stout
thump
of
the
table
they
all
tak
it
for
granted
young
squire
walked
on
to
yon
bridge
an
it
theer
and
then
fell
to
pieces
who
see
it
fall
to
pieces
who
was
theer
to
see
what
did
happen
what
else
did
happen
or
could
happen
nor
what
were
testified
to
asked
a
new
voice
theer
wor
what
they
call
circumstantial
evidence
to
show
how
all
t
affair
happened
circumstantial
evidence
be
blowed
sneered
the
blacksmith
heartily
i
reckon
nowt
o
circumstantial
evidence
look
ye
here
how
do
you
know
how
does
anybody
know
t
young
squire
wor
thrown
off
that
bridge
and
t
bridge
collapsed
when
he
wor
thrown
he
might
ha
met
somebody
on
t
bridge
and
quarrelled
wi
and
whoivver
it
wor
might
ha
been
t
strongest
man
and
flung
him
into
t
road
beneath
aye
but
i
that
case
t
other
feller
t
assailant
ha
fallen
him
objected
somebody
nowt
o
t
sort
retorted
the
blacksmith
he
be
safe
on
t
sound
part
o
t
bridge
it
only
a
piece
on
that
gave
way
i
say
that

another
thing
what

fro
barford

about

what

why

at
yon
inquest
about
mallathorpe
and
t
affair
not
one
word
a
sudden
silence
fell
on
the
company
and
the
landlord
tapped
collingwood
arm
and
took
the
liberty
of
winking
at
him
why
inquired
somebody
at
last
what
about
mallathorpe
and
affair
what
had
she
to
do
wi
t
affair
the
blacksmith
voice
became
judicial
in
its
solemnity

said
with
emphasis

talking
about

when
this
here
pratt
ran
to
tell

he
returned
to
what
they
term

and
a

and
dan
scholes

mestur

an
eager
member
of

assemblage

the
blacksmith
voice
sank
to
a
mysterious
whisper
i
tell
yer
he
replied
they

lyin
i
a
dead
faint
close
by
and
they
say

of
course
she

able
to
tell
if
she

owt
or

and
what
i
say
is
he
concluded
with
a
heavy
thump
of
the
table
that
theer
crowner
quest
owt
to
ha
been
what
they
term
adjourned
until

and
theer
trouble

if

now
then
collingwood
went
away
from
his
retreat
beckoning
the
landlord
to
follow
in
the
parlour
he
turned
to
him
have
you
heard
anything
of
what
stringer
said
just
now
he
asked
i
mean
about
mrs
mallathorpe
heard
just
the
same
and
from
the
same
chap
scholes
the
groom
sir
replied
the
landlord
oh
yes
of
course
people
will
wonder
why
they
did
get
some
evidence
from
mallathorpe
just
as
stringer
says
collingwood
sat
a
long
time
that
night
thinking
over
the
things
he
had
heard
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
domineering
blacksmith
was
right
in
one
of
his
dogmatic
assertions
there
was
trouble
ahead
and
next
morning
before
going
up
to
the
grange
he
went
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
and
sent
sir
john
standridge
a
lengthy
message
in
which
he
resigned
the
appointment
that
would
have
taken
him
to
india
chapter

the

of

collingwood
had
many
things
to
think
over
as
he
walked
across
normandale
park
that
morning
he
had
deliberately
given
up
his
indian
appointment
for
nesta
sake
so
that
he
might
be
near
her
in
case
the
trouble
which
he
feared
arose
suddenly
but
it
was
too
soon
yet
to
let
her
know
that
she
was
the
cause
of
his
altered
arrangements
in
any
case
that
was
not
the
time
to
tell
her
that
it
was
on
her
account
that
he
had
altered
them
he
must
make
some
plausible
excuse
then
he
must
settle
down
in
barford
according
to
eldrick
suggestion
he
would
then
be
near
at
hand
and
if
the
trouble
whatever
it
might
be
took
tangible
form
he
would
be
able
to
help
but
he
was
still
utterly
in
the
dark
as
to
what
that
possible
trouble
might
be
yet
of
one
thing
he
felt
convinced
it
would
have
some
connection
with
pratt
he
remembered
as
he
walked
along
that
he
had
formed
some
queer
uneasy
suspicion
about
pratt
when
he
first
hurried
down
to
barford
on
hearing
of
antony
bartle
death
that
feeling
subsequently
allayed
to
some
extent
had
been
revived
there
might
be
nothing
in
it
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
everything
that
seemed
strange
might
be
easily
explained
the
evidence
of
pratt
at
the
inquest
had
appeared
absolutely
truthful
and
straightforward
and
yet
the
blunt
rough
downright
question
of
the
blacksmith
crudely
voiced
as
it
was
found
a
ready
agreement
in
collingwood
mind
as
he
drew
near
the
house
he
found
himself
repeating
stringer
broad
yorkshire
what
wor
that
chap
fro
barford
pratt
doin
about
theer
what
reight
had
he
to
be
prowlin
round
t
neighbourhood
o
that
bridge
and
at
that
time
come
now
theer
a
tickler
for
somebody
and
even
as
he
smiled
at
the
remembrance
of
the
whole
rustic
conversation
of
the
previous
evening
and
thought
that
the
blacksmith
question
certainly
might
be
a
ticklish
one
for
somebody
he
looked
up
from
the
frosted
grass
at
his
feet
and
saw
pratt
pratt
a
bag
in
his
hand
a
morning
newspaper
under
the
other
arm
was
standing
at
the
gate
of
one
of
the
numerous
shrubberies
which
flanked
the
grange
talking
to
a
woman
who
leaned
over
it
collingwood
recognized
her
as
a
person
whom
he
had
twice
seen
in
the
house
during
his
visits
on
the
day
before
slightly
built
woman
neatly
dressed
in
black
and
wearing
a
sort
of
nurse
cap
which
seemed
to
denote
some
degree
of
domestic
servitude
she
was
a
woman
who
had
once
been
pretty
and
who
still
retained
much
of
her
good
looks
she
was
also
evidently
of
considerable
shrewdness
and
intelligence
and
possessed
a
pair
of
remarkably
quick
eyes
the
sort
of
eyes
thought
collingwood
that
see
everything
that
happens
within
their
range
of
vision
and
she
had
a
firm
chin
and
a
mouth
which
expressed
determination
he
had
seen
all
that
as
she
exchanged
some
conversation
with
the
old
butler
in
collingwood
presence
a
noticeable
woman
altogether
she
was
evidently
in
close
conference
with
pratt
at
that
moment
but
as
collingwood
drew
near
she
turned
and
went
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
house
while
pratt
always
outwardly
polite
stepped
towards
the
interrupter
of
this
meeting
and
lifted
his
hat
good
morning
collingwood
he
said
a
fine
sharp
morning
sir
i
was
just
asking
mallathorpe
maid
how
her
mistress
is
this
morning
she
was
very
ill
when
i
left
last
night
better
sir
i
glad
to
say
mallathorpe
has
had
a
much
better
night
i
very
pleased
to
hear
it
replied
collingwood
he
was
going
towards
the
front
of
the
grange
and
pratt
walked
at
his
side
evidently
in
the
same
direction
i
am
afraid
she
has
had
a
great
shock
you
are
still
here
then
he
went
on
feeling
bound
to
make
some
remark
and
saying
the
first
obvious
thing
still
busy
eldrick
has
lent
me
so
to
speak
until
the
funeral
over
tomorrow
answered
pratt
there
are
a
lot
of
little
things
in
which
i
can
be
useful
you
know
collingwood
i
suppose
your
arrangements
you
said
you
were
sailing
for
india
wo
permit
of
your
being
present
tomorrow
sir
collingwood
was
not
sure
if
the
clerk
was
fishing
for
information
pratt
manner
was
always
polite
his
questions
so
innocently
put
that
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
he
was
actually
after
but
he
was
not
going
to
give
him
any
information
either
then
or
at
any
time
i
do
quite
know
what
my
arrangements
may
be
he
answered
and
just
then
they
came
to
the
front
entrance
and
collingwood
was
taken
off
in
one
direction
by
a
footman
while
pratt
who
already
seemed
to
be
fully
acquainted
with
the
house
and
its
arrangements
took
himself
and
his
bag
away
in
another
nesta
came
to
collingwood
looking
less
anxious
than
when
he
had
left
her
at
his
last
call
the
night
before
he
had
already
told
her
what
his
impressions
of
the
inquest
were
and
he
was
now
wondering
whether
to
tell
her
of
the
things
he
had
heard
said
at
the
village
inn
but
remembering
that
he
was
now
going
to
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
he
decided
to
say
nothing
at
that
time
if
there
was
anything
in
these
vague
feelings
and
suspicions
it
would
come
out
and
could
be
dealt
with
when
it
arose
at
present
he
had
need
of
a
little
diplomacy
oh
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
said
after
talking
to
her
awhile
about
mallathorpe
i
there
a
change
in
my
arrangements
i
not
going
to
india
after
all
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
sudden
flush
that
came
over
the
girl
face
it
took
him
aback
it
also
told
him
a
good
deal
that
he
was
glad
to
know
and
it
was
only
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
that
he
kept
himself
from
taking
her
hands
and
telling
her
the
truth
but
he
affected
not
to
see
anything
and
he
went
on
talking
rapidly
complete
change
in
the
arrangements
at
the
last
minute
he
said
i
just
been
writing
about
it
so
as
that
off
i
think
i
shall
follow
eldrick
advice
and
take
chambers
in
barford
for
a
time
and
see
how
things
turn
out
i
going
into
barford
now
to
see
eldrick
about
all
that
nesta
who
was
conscious
of
her
betrayal
of
more
than
she
cared
to
show
just
then
tried
to
speak
calmly
but
is
it
an
awful
disappointment
she
said
you
were
looking
forward
so
to
going
there
were
you
ca
be
helped
replied
collingwood
all
these
affairs
are
provisional
i
thought
i
tell
you
at
once
however
so
that
you
know
if
you
ever
want
me
that
i
shall
be
somewhere
round
about
in
fact
as
it
quite
comfortable
there
i
shall
stop
at
the
inn
until
i
got
rooms
in
the
town
then
not
trusting
himself
to
remain
longer
he
went
off
to
barford
certain
that
he
was
now
definitely
pledged
in
his
own
mind
to
nesta
mallathorpe
and
not
much
less
that
when
the
right
time
came
she
would
not
be
irresponsive
to
him
and
on
that
like
a
cold
douche
came
the
remembrance
of
her
actual
circumstances
she
was
what
eldrick
had
said
one
of
the
wealthiest
young
women
in
yorkshire
the
thought
of
her
riches
made
collingwood
melancholy
for
a
while
he
possessed
a
curious
sort
of
pride
which
made
him
hate
and
loathe
the
notion
of
being
taken
for
a
but
suddenly
and
with
a
laugh
he
remembered
that
he
had
certain
possessions
of
his
own
ability
knowledge
and
perseverance
before
he
reached
eldrick
office
he
had
had
a
vision
of
the
woolsack
eldrick
received
collingwood
news
with
evident
gratification
he
immediately
suggested
certain
chambers
in
an
adjacent
building
he
volunteered
information
as
to
where
the
best
rooms
in
the
town
were
to
be
had
and
in
proof
of
his
practical
interest
in
collingwood
career
he
there
and
then
engaged
his
professional
services
for
two
cases
which
were
to
be
heard
at
a
local
court
within
the
following
week
pratt
shall
deliver
the
papers
to
you
at
once
he
said
that
is
as
soon
as
he
back
from
normandale
this
afternoon
i
sent
him
there
again
to
make
himself
useful
i
saw
him
this
morning
remarked
collingwood
he
appears
to
be
a
very
useful
person
clever
chap
asserted
eldrick
carelessly
i
do
know
what
be
done
about
that
stewardship
that
he
was
going
to
apply
for
everything
will
be
altered
now
that
young
mallathorpe
dead
of
course
i
personally
should
have
thought
that
pratt
would
have
done
for
a
job
like
that
but
pratt
has
enough
and
for
a
dozen
men
and
he
thought
he
would
do
and
i
could
refuse
him
a
testimonial
and
as
he
made
himself
very
useful
out
there
it
may
be
that
if
this
steward
business
goes
forward
pratt
will
get
the
appointment
as
i
say
he
a
smart
chap
collingwood
offered
no
comment
but
he
was
conscious
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
pleasing
to
him
to
know
that
linford
pratt
held
any
official
position
at
normandale
foolish
as
it
might
be
mere
inspiration
though
it
probably
was
he
could
not
get
over
his
impression
that
clerk
was
not
precisely
trustworthy
and
yet
he
reflected
he
himself
could
do
nothing
it
would
be
utter
presumption
on
his
part
to
offer
any
gratuitous
advice
to
nesta
mallathorpe
in
business
matters
he
was
very
certain
of
what
he
eventually
meant
to
say
to
her
about
his
own
personal
hopes
some
time
hence
when
all
the
present
trouble
was
over
but
in
the
meantime
as
regarded
anything
else
he
could
only
wait
and
watch
and
be
of
service
to
her
if
she
asked
him
to
render
any
some
time
went
by
before
collingwood
was
asked
to
render
service
of
any
sort
at
normandale
grange
events
progressed
in
apparently
ordinary
and
normal
fashion
harper
mallathorpe
was
buried
his
mother
began
to
make
some
recovery
from
the
shock
of
his
death
the
legal
folk
were
busied
in
putting
nesta
in
possession
of
the
estate
and
herself
and
her
mother
in
proprietorship
of
the
mill
and
the
personal
property
in
barford
things
went
on
as
usual
too
pratt
continued
his
round
of
duties
at
eldrick
pascoe
no
more
was
heard
by
outsiders
at
any
rate
of
the
stewardship
at
normandale
as
for
collingwood
he
settled
down
in
chambers
and
lodgings
and
as
eldrick
had
predicted
found
plenty
of
work
and
he
constantly
went
out
to
normandale
grange
and
often
met
nesta
elsewhere
and
their
knowledge
of
each
other
increased
and
as
the
winter
passed
away
and
spring
began
to
show
on
the
normandale
woods
and
moors
collingwood
felt
that
the
time
was
coming
when
he
might
speak
he
was
professionally
engaged
in
london
for
nearly
three
weeks
in
the
early
part
of
that
spring
when
he
returned
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
nesta
the
truth
at
once
he
had
faced
it
for
himself
he
was
by
that
time
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
monetary
considerations
prevent
him
from
telling
her
so
but
collingwood
found
something
else
than
love
to
talk
about
when
he
presented
himself
at
normandale
grange
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
from
his
three
weeks
absence
in
town
as
soon
as
he
met
her
he
saw
that
nesta
was
not
only
upset
and
troubled
but
angry
i
am
glad
you
have
come
she
said
when
they
were
alone
i
want
some
advice
something
has
happened
something
that
bothers
and
puzzles
me
very
very
much
i
dreadfully
bothered
tell
me
suggested
collingwood
nesta
frowned
at
some
recollection
or
thought
yesterday
afternoon
she
answered
i
was
obliged
to
go
into
barford
on
business
i
left
my
mother
fairly
well
has
been
recovering
fast
lately
and
she
only
has
one
nurse
now
unfortunately
she
too
was
out
for
the
afternoon
i
came
back
to
find
my
mother
ill
and
much
upset
there
no
use
denying
it
she
all
the
symptoms
of
having
been
well
frightened
i
ca
think
of
any
other
term
than
that
frightened
and
then
i
learned
that
in
my
absence
clerk
pratt
you
know
him
had
been
here
and
had
been
with
her
for
quite
an
hour
i
am
furiously
angry
collingwood
had
expected
this
announcement
as
soon
as
she
began
to
explain
so
the
trouble
was
beginning
how
came
pratt
to
be
admitted
to
your
mother
he
asked
that
makes
me
angry
too
answered
nesta
though
i
confess
i
ought
to
be
angry
with
myself
for
not
giving
stricter
orders
i
left
the
house
about
two
he
came
about
three
and
asked
to
see
my
mother
maid
esther
mawson
he
told
her
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
see
my
mother
on
business
and
she
told
my
mother
he
was
there
my
mother
consented
to
see
him
and
he
was
taken
up
and
as
i
say
i
found
her
ill
and
frightened
and
that
not
the
worst
of
it
what
is
the
worst
of
it
asked
collingwood
anxiously
better
tell
me
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
the
worst
of
it
she
said
is
just
this
my
mother
wo
tell
me
what
that
man
came
about
she
flatly
refuses
to
tell
me
anything
she
will
only
say
that
it
was
business
of
her
own
she
wo
trust
me
with
it
you
see
her
own
daughter
what
business
can
that
man
have
with
her
or
she
with
him
eldrick
pascoe
are
not
our
solicitors
some
secret
and
will
you
answer
one
or
two
questions
said
collingwood
quietly
he
had
never
seen
nesta
angry
before
and
he
now
realized
that
she
had
certain
possibilities
of
temper
and
determination
which
would
be
formidable
when
roused
first
of
all
is
that
maid
you
speak
of
esther
mawson
reliable
i
do
know
answered
nesta
my
mother
has
had
her
two
years
a
barford
woman
sometimes
i
think
she
sly
and
cunning
but
i
given
her
such
strict
orders
now
that
she
never
dare
to
let
any
one
see
my
mother
again
without
my
consent
the
other
question
this
said
collingwood
have
you
any
idea
any
suspicion
of
why
pratt
wanted
to
see
your
mother
not
unless
it
was
about
that
stewardship
replied
nesta
but
how
could
that
frighten
her
besides
all
that
over
normandale
is
mine
and
if
i
have
a
steward
or
an
estate
agent
i
shall
see
to
the
appointment
myself
no
i
do
not
know
why
he
should
have
come
here
but
there
some
mystery
the
curious
thing
is
what
asked
collingwood
as
she
paused
why
she
said
shaking
her
head
wonderingly
that
i
absolutely
certain
that
my
mother
never
even
knew
this
man
pratt
i
do
i
think
she
even
knew
his
name
until
quite
recently
i
know
when
she
got
to
know
him
too
it
was
just
about
the
time
that
you
first
called
here
at
the
time
of
bartle
death
our
butler
told
me
this
morning
that
pratt
came
here
late
one
evening
just
about
that
time
and
asked
to
see
my
mother
and
was
with
her
for
some
time
in
the
study
oh
what
is
it
all
about
and
why
does
she
tell
me
collingwood
stood
silently
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
time
of
antony
bartle
death
an
evening
visit
evidently
of
a
secret
nature
and
why
paid
to
mallathorpe
at
that
particular
time
he
suddenly
turned
to
nesta
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
he
asked
will
you
speak
to
mr
eldrick
she
said
tell
him
that
his
clerk
must
not
call
upon
or
attempt
to
see
my
mother
i
will
not
have
it
collingwood
went
off
to
barford
and
straight
to
eldrick
office
he
noticed
as
he
passed
through
the
outer
rooms
that
pratt
was
not
in
his
accustomed
place
as
a
rule
it
was
impossible
to
get
at
either
eldrick
or
pascoe
without
first
seeing
pratt
hullo
said
eldrick
just
got
in
from
town
that
lucky
i
got
a
big
case
for
you
i
got
in
last
night
replied
collingwood
but
i
went
out
to
normandale
first
thing
this
morning
i
just
come
back
from
there
i
say
eldrick
here
an
unpleasant
matter
to
tell
you
of
and
he
told
the
solicitor
all
that
nesta
had
just
told
him
and
also
of
visit
to
mallathorpe
about
the
time
of
antony
bartle
death
whatever
it
is
he
concluded
sternly
it
got
to
stop
if
you
any
influence
over
your
clerk
eldrick
made
a
grimace
and
waved
his
hand
he
our
clerk
no
longer
he
said
he
left
us
the
week
after
you
went
up
to
town
collingwood
he
was
only
a
weekly
servant
and
he
took
advantage
of
that
to
give
me
a
week
notice
now
what
game
is
master
pratt
playing
he
smart
and
he
deep
too
he
just
then
an
announced
robson
the
mallathorpe
family
solicitor
a
bustling
rather
type
of
man
who
came
into
eldrick
room
looking
not
only
angry
but
astonished
he
nodded
to
collingwood
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
at
the
side
of
desk
look
here
eldrick
he
exclaimed
what
on
earth
has
that
clerk
of
yours
pratt
got
to
do
with
mallathorpe
do
you
know
what
mallathorpe
has
done
hang
it
she
must
be
out
of
her
senses
or
or
there
something
i
ca
fathom
she
given
your
clerk
linford
pratt
a
power
of
attorney
to
deal
with
all
her
affairs
and
all
her
property
oh
it
all
right
i
tell
you
pratt
been
to
my
office
and
exhibited
it
to
me
as
if
as
if
he
were
the
lord
chancellor
eldrick
turned
to
collingwood
and
collingwood
to
eldrick
and
then
both
turned
to
robson
chapter
xiii
the
first
trick
the
mallathorpe
family
solicitor
shook
his
head
impatiently
under
those
questioning
glances
it
not
a
bit
of
use
appealing
to
me
to
know
what
it
means
he
exclaimed
i
know
no
more
than
what
i
told
you
that
chap
walked
into
my
office
as
bold
as
brass
half
an
hour
ago
and
exhibited
to
me
a
power
of
attorney
all
duly
drawn
up
and
stamped
executed
in
his
favour
by
mallathorpe
yesterday
and
as
mallathorpe
is
as
far
as
i
know
in
her
senses
why
there
you
are
what
is
it
asked
eldrick
a
general
power
or
a
special
general
answered
robson
with
an
air
of
disgust
authorizes
him
to
act
for
her
in
all
business
matters
it
means
of
course
that
that
fellow
now
has
full
control
over
why
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
the
estate
of
course
is
miss
mallathorpe
he
ca
interfere
with
that
but
mallathorpe
shares
equally
with
her
daughter
as
regards
the
personal
property
of
harper
mallathorpe
his
share
in
the
business
and
all
that
he
left
and
what
more
mallathorpe
is
administratrix
of
the
personal
property
she
simply
placed
in
pratt
hands
an
enormous
power
and
for
what
reason
who
on
earth
is
pratt
what
right
title
age
or
qualification
has
he
to
be
entrusted
with
such
a
big
affair
i
never
knew
of
such
a
business
in
the
whole
course
of
my
professional
experiences
nor
i
agreed
eldrick
but
there
one
thing
in
which
mistaken
robson
you
ask
what
qualification
pratt
has
for
a
post
of
that
sort
pratt
a
very
smart
clever
managing
chap
oh
of
course
he
your
clerk
retorted
robson
a
little
sneeringly
naturally
you
a
big
idea
of
his
abilities
but
he
not
our
clerk
any
longer
said
eldrick
he
left
us
about
a
week
ago
i
heard
this
morning
that
he
set
up
an
office
in
market
street
in
the
atlas
building
and
i
wondered
for
what
purpose
purpose
of
fleecing
mallathorpe
i
should
say
grumbled
robson
of
course
everything
of
hers
must
pass
through
his
hands
what
on
earth
can
her
daughter
have
been
thinking
of
to
allow
stop
a
bit
interrupted
eldrick
collingwood
came
in
to
tell
me
about
that
he
just
come
from
normandale
grange
miss
mallathorpe
complains
that
pratt
called
there
yesterday
in
her
absence
that
probably
when
this
power
of
attorney
was
signed
but
miss
mallathorpe
does
know
anything
of
it
she
insists
that
pratt
shall
not
visit
her
mother
robson
stirred
impatiently
in
his
chair
that
all
bosh
he
said
she
ca
prevent
it
i
saw
mallathorpe
myself
three
days
ago
she
recovering
very
well
and
in
her
right
senses
and
she
capable
of
doing
business
her
daughter
ca
prevent
her
from
doing
anything
she
likes
and
if
she
did
what
she
liked
yesterday
when
she
signed
that
document
why
powerless
except
pratt
there
the
question
of
how
the
document
was
obtained
remarked
collingwood
there
may
have
been
undue
influence
the
two
solicitors
looked
at
each
other
then
eldrick
rose
from
his
chair
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
said
it
no
affair
of
mine
but
we
employed
pratt
for
years
and
he
confide
in
me
i
go
and
see
him
and
ask
him
what
it
all
about
wait
here
a
while
you
two
he
went
out
of
his
office
and
across
into
market
street
where
the
atlas
building
a
modern
range
of
offices
and
chambers
towered
above
the
older
structures
at
its
foot
in
the
entrance
hall
a
man
was
gilding
the
name
of
a
new
tenant
on
the
address
board
that
name
was
pratt
and
eldrick
presently
found
himself
ascending
in
the
lift
to
quarters
on
the
fifth
floor
within
five
minutes
of
leaving
collingwood
and
robson
he
was
closeted
with
pratt
in
a
and
appointed
little
office
of
two
rooms
the
inner
one
of
which
was
almost
luxurious
in
its
fittings
and
pratt
himself
looked
extremely
well
satisfied
and
confident
and
quite
at
his
ease
he
wheeled
forward
an
easy
chair
for
his
visitor
and
pushed
a
box
of
cigarettes
towards
him
glad
to
see
you
eldrick
he
said
with
a
cordial
politeness
which
suggested
however
somehow
that
he
and
the
solicitor
were
no
longer
master
and
servant
how
do
you
like
my
little
place
of
business
you
making
a
comfortable
nest
of
it
anyhow
pratt
answered
eldrick
looking
round
and
what
sort
of
business
are
you
going
to
do
pray
agency
replied
pratt
promptly
it
struck
me
some
little
time
ago
that
a
smart
man
like
myself
eh
could
do
well
here
in
barford
as
an
agent
in
a
new
sort
of
fashion
attending
to
things
for
people
who
are
fitted
or
inclined
to
do
for
themselves
or
are
rich
enough
to
employ
somebody
to
look
after
their
affairs
of
course
that
normandale
stewardship
dropped
out
when
young
harper
died
and
i
suppose
the
notion
be
revived
now
that
his
sister
come
in
but
i
got
one
good
job
to
go
on
with
mallathorpe
given
me
her
affairs
to
look
after
eldrick
took
one
of
the
cigarettes
and
lighted
it
as
a
sign
of
his
peaceable
and
amicable
intentions
pratt
he
said
that
just
what
i
come
to
see
you
about
unofficially
mind
in
quite
a
friendly
way
it
like
this
and
he
went
on
to
tell
pratt
of
what
had
just
occurred
at
his
own
office
so
there
you
are
he
concluded
i
saying
nothing
you
know
no
affair
of
mine
but
if
these
people
begin
to
say
that
you
used
any
undue
influence
collingwood
and
robson
and
miss
mallathorpe
and
anybody
answered
pratt
slowly
and
firmly
had
better
mind
what
they
are
saying
eldrick
there
such
a
thing
as
slander
as
you
well
aware
i
not
the
man
to
be
slandered
or
libelled
or
to
have
my
character
defamed
without
fighting
for
my
rights
there
has
been
no
undue
influence
i
went
to
see
mallathorpe
yesterday
at
her
own
request
the
arrangement
between
me
and
her
is
made
with
her
approval
and
free
will
if
her
daughter
found
her
a
bit
upset
it
because
such
a
shock
at
the
time
of
her
son
death
i
did
nothing
to
frighten
her
not
i
the
fact
is
miss
mallathorpe
does
know
that
her
mother
and
i
have
had
a
bit
of
business
together
of
late
and
all
that
mallathorpe
has
entrusted
to
me
is
the
power
to
look
after
her
affairs
for
her
and
why
not
you
know
that
i
a
good
man
of
business
a
really
good
hand
at
commercial
accountancy
and
well
acquainted
with
the
trade
of
this
town
you
know
too
eldrick
that
i
scrupulously
honest
i
had
many
and
many
a
thousand
pounds
of
yours
and
your
partner
through
my
hands
who
got
anything
to
say
against
me
only
trying
to
earn
an
honest
living
well
well
said
eldrick
who
being
an
and
man
was
somewhat
inclined
to
side
with
his
old
clerk
i
suppose
robson
thinks
that
if
mallathorpe
wished
to
put
her
affairs
in
anybody
hands
she
should
have
put
them
in
his
he
their
family
solicitor
you
know
pratt
while
you
a
young
man
with
no
claim
on
mrs
mallathorpe
pratt
smiled
a
queer
knowing
smile
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
some
papers
which
lay
on
his
desk
you
wrong
there
eldrick
he
said
but
of
course
you
know
i
did
know
myself
nor
did
mallathorpe
until
lately
but
i
have
a
claim
and
a
good
one
to
get
a
business
lift
from
mallathorpe
i
a
relation
what
of
the
mallathorpe
family
exclaimed
eldrick
whose
legal
mind
was
at
once
bitten
by
notion
of
kinship
and
succession
and
who
knew
that
harper
mallathorpe
was
supposed
to
have
no
male
relatives
at
all
of
any
degree
you
do
mean
it
no
but
of
hers
mallathorpe
answered
pratt
my
mother
was
her
cousin
i
found
that
out
by
mere
chance
and
when
i
found
it
i
worked
out
the
facts
from
our
parish
church
register
they
all
here
fairly
copied
mallathorpe
has
seen
them
so
i
have
some
claim
even
if
it
only
that
of
a
poor
relation
eldrick
took
the
sheets
of
foolscap
which
pratt
handed
to
him
and
looked
them
over
with
interest
and
curiosity
he
was
something
of
an
expert
in
such
matters
and
had
helped
to
edit
a
print
more
than
once
of
the
local
parish
registers
he
soon
saw
from
a
hasty
examination
of
the
various
entries
of
marriages
and
births
that
pratt
was
quite
right
in
what
he
said
i
call
it
a
poor
and
a
mean
game
remarked
pratt
while
his
old
master
was
thus
occupied
a
very
mean
game
indeed
of
folk
like
collingwood
and
robson
to
want
to
injure
me
in
a
matter
which
is
no
business
of
theirs
i
shall
do
my
duty
by
mallathorpe
you
yourself
know
i
fully
competent
to
do
it
and
i
shall
fully
earn
the
percentage
that
she
pay
me
what
right
have
these
people
what
right
has
her
daughter
to
come
between
me
and
my
living
oh
well
well
said
eldrick
as
he
handed
back
the
papers
and
rose
it
one
of
those
matters
that
has
been
understood
you
made
a
mistake
you
know
pratt
when
you
went
to
see
mallathorpe
yesterday
in
her
daughter
absence
you
should
have
done
that
pratt
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
after
turning
over
some
loose
papers
picked
out
a
letter
do
you
know
mallathorpe
handwriting
he
asked
very
well
there
it
is
is
that
a
request
from
her
that
i
should
call
on
her
yesterday
afternoon
very
well
then
eldrick
looked
at
the
letter
with
some
surprise
he
had
a
good
memory
and
he
remembered
that
collingwood
had
told
him
that
nesta
had
said
that
pratt
had
gone
to
normandale
grange
seen
esther
mawson
and
told
her
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
see
mallathorpe
and
though
eldrick
was
naturally
unsuspicious
an
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
had
pratt
got
mallathorpe
to
write
that
letter
while
he
was
there
yesterday
and
brought
it
away
with
him
i
think
there
a
good
deal
of
misunderstanding
he
said
collingwood
says
that
you
went
there
and
told
her
maid
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
you
to
see
her
mistress
sort
of
forced
yourself
in
you
see
pratt
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
pratt
he
flourished
the
letter
in
his
hand
does
it
say
there
in
mallathorpe
own
handwriting
that
she
particularly
desires
to
see
me
at
three
it
does
then
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
see
her
come
now
and
collingwood
had
best
attend
to
his
own
business
what
he
got
to
do
with
all
this
after
miss
mallathorpe
and
her
money
i
should
think
that
about
it
eldrick
said
another
soothing
word
or
two
and
went
back
to
his
own
office
he
was
considerably
mystified
by
certain
things
but
inclined
to
be
satisfied
about
others
and
in
giving
an
account
of
what
had
just
taken
place
he
unconsciously
seemed
to
take
pratt
side
much
to
robson
disgust
and
to
collingwood
astonishment
you
ca
get
over
this
you
know
robson
said
eldrick
pratt
went
there
yesterday
by
appointment
went
at
mallathorpe
own
express
desire
made
in
her
own
handwriting
and
it
quite
certain
that
what
he
says
about
the
relationship
is
true
examined
the
proof
myself
not
unnatural
that
mallathorpe
should
desire
to
do
something
for
her
own
cousin
son
to
that
extent
sneered
robson
bless
me
you
talk
as
if
it
were
no
more
than
presenting
him
with
a
twenty
pound
note
instead
of
its
being
what
it
is
giving
him
the
practical
control
of
many
a
thousand
pounds
every
year
there
be
more
heard
of
this
yet
he
went
away
angrier
than
when
he
came
and
eldrick
looked
at
collingwood
and
shook
his
head
i
do
see
what
more
there
is
to
do
he
said
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
or
see
pratt
is
within
his
rights
if
mallathorpe
liked
to
entrust
her
business
to
him
what
is
to
prevent
it
i
see
nothing
at
all
strange
in
that
but
there
is
a
fact
which
does
seem
uncommonly
strange
to
me
it
this
how
is
it
that
mallathorpe
does
consult
has
consulted
does
inform
has
informed
her
daughter
about
all
this
that
answered
collingwood
is
precisely
what
strikes
me
and
i
give
any
explanation
nor
i
believe
can
miss
mallathorpe
he
felt
obliged
to
go
back
to
normandale
and
tell
nesta
the
result
of
the
afternoon
proceedings
and
having
seen
during
his
previous
visit
how
angry
she
could
be
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
her
become
angrier
and
more
determined
than
ever
i
will
not
have
pratt
coming
here
she
exclaimed
he
shall
not
see
my
mother
under
my
roof
at
any
rate
i
do
believe
she
sent
for
him
eldrick
saw
her
letter
interrupted
collingwood
quietly
then
that
man
made
her
write
it
while
he
was
here
exclaimed
nesta
as
to
the
relationship
it
may
be
so
i
never
heard
of
it
but
i
care
what
relation
he
is
to
my
mother
he
is
not
going
to
interfere
with
her
affairs
the
strange
thing
said
collingwood
as
pointedly
as
was
consistent
with
kindness
is
that
your
mother
just
now
at
any
rate
does
seem
to
be
taking
you
into
her
confidence
nesta
looked
steadily
at
him
for
a
moment
without
speaking
when
she
did
speak
it
was
with
decision
quite
so
she
said
she
is
keeping
something
from
me
and
if
she
wo
tell
me
things
well
i
must
find
them
out
for
myself
she
would
say
no
more
than
that
and
collingwood
left
her
and
as
he
went
back
to
barford
he
cursed
linford
pratt
soundly
for
a
deep
and
underhand
rogue
who
was
most
certainly
playing
some
fine
game
but
pratt
himself
was
quite
satisfied
up
to
that
point
he
had
won
his
first
trick
and
he
had
splendid
cards
still
left
in
his
hand
and
he
was
reckoning
his
chances
on
them
one
morning
a
little
later
when
a
ring
at
his
bell
summoned
him
to
his
office
door
whereat
stood
nesta
mallathorpe
alone
chapter
xiv
cards
on
the
table
had
any
third
person
been
present
closely
to
observe
the
meeting
of
these
two
young
people
he
would
have
seen
that
the
one
to
whom
it
was
unexpected
and
a
surprise
was
outwardly
as
calm
and
as
if
the
other
had
come
there
to
keep
an
ordinary
business
appointment
nesta
mallathorpe
looking
very
dignified
and
almost
stately
in
her
mourning
was
obviously
angry
indignant
and
agitated
but
pratt
was
as
cool
and
as
fully
at
his
ease
as
if
he
were
back
in
eldrick
office
receiving
the
everyday
ordinary
client
he
swept
his
door
open
and
executed
his
politest
bow
and
was
clever
enough
to
pretend
that
he
saw
nothing
of
his
visitor
agitation
yet
deep
within
himself
he
felt
more
tremors
than
one
and
it
needed
all
his
powers
of
dissimulation
to
act
and
speak
as
if
this
were
the
most
usual
of
occurrences
good
morning
miss
mallathorpe
he
said
you
wish
to
see
me
come
into
my
private
office
if
you
please
i
have
fixed
on
a
clerk
yet
he
went
on
as
he
led
his
visitor
through
the
outer
room
and
to
the
easy
chair
by
his
desk
i
have
several
applications
from
promising
aspirants
but
i
have
to
be
careful
you
know
miss
mallathorpe
it
a
position
of
confidence
and
now
he
concluded
as
he
closed
the
door
upon
nesta
and
himself
how
is
mallathorpe
today
improving
i
hope
nesta
made
no
reply
to
these
remarks
or
to
the
question
and
instead
of
taking
the
easy
chair
which
eldrick
had
found
so
comfortable
she
went
to
one
which
stood
against
the
wall
opposite
pratt
desk
and
seated
herself
in
it
in
as
upright
a
position
as
the
wall
behind
her
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
plainly
she
said
as
pratt
who
now
regarded
her
somewhat
doubtfully
realizing
that
he
was
in
for
business
of
a
serious
nature
sat
down
at
his
desk
i
want
to
ask
you
a
plain
question
and
i
expect
a
plain
answer
why
are
you
blackmailing
my
mother
pratt
shook
his
head
as
if
he
felt
more
sorrow
than
anger
he
glanced
deprecatingly
at
his
visitor
i
think
you
be
sorry
on
reflection
that
you
said
that
miss
mallathorpe
he
answered
you
a
little
shall
we
say
upset
a
little
shall
we
say
angry
if
you
were
calmer
you
would
say
such
things
you
would
use
such
a
term
as
blackmailing
it
dear
me
i
dare
say
you
do
know
it
it
actionable
if
i
were
that
sort
of
man
miss
mallathorpe
and
you
said
that
of
me
before
witnesses
ah
i
do
know
what
might
happen
however
i
not
that
sort
of
man
but
do
say
it
again
if
you
please
if
you
do
answer
my
question
and
at
once
said
nesta
whose
cheeks
were
pale
with
angry
determination
i
shall
say
it
again
in
a
fashion
you
wo
like
not
to
you
but
to
the
police
pratt
smiled
a
quiet
strange
smile
which
made
his
visitor
feel
a
sudden
sense
of
fear
and
again
he
shook
his
head
slowly
and
deprecatingly
oh
no
he
said
gently
that
a
bigger
mistake
than
the
other
miss
mallathorpe
the
police
oh
not
the
police
i
think
miss
mallathorpe
you
see
other
people
than
you
might
go
to
the
police
about
something
else
nesta
anger
cooled
down
under
that
scarcely
veiled
threat
the
sight
of
pratt
of
his
his
comfortable
offices
his
general
atmosphere
of
almost
sleek
satisfaction
had
roused
her
temper
already
strained
to
breaking
point
but
that
smile
and
the
quiet
look
which
accompanied
his
last
words
warned
her
that
anger
was
mere
foolishness
and
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
calmly
if
the
dealings
were
to
be
successful
yet
she
repeated
her
words
but
this
time
in
a
different
tone
i
shall
certainly
go
to
the
police
authorities
she
said
unless
i
get
some
proper
explanation
from
you
i
shall
have
no
option
you
are
forcing
or
have
forced
my
mother
to
enter
into
some
strange
arrangements
with
you
and
i
ca
think
it
is
for
anything
but
what
i
say
blackmail
you
got
or
you
think
you
got
some
hold
on
her
now
what
is
it
i
mean
to
know
one
way
or
another
miss
mallathorpe
said
pratt
you
taking
a
wrong
course
with
me
now
who
advised
you
to
come
here
and
speak
to
me
like
this
as
if
i
were
a
common
criminal
collingwood
no
doubt
or
perhaps
robson
now
if
either
neither
robson
nor
collingwood
know
anything
whatever
about
my
coming
here
retorted
nesta
no
one
knows
i
am
quite
competent
to
manage
my
own
affairs
of
this
sort
i
want
to
know
why
my
mother
has
been
forced
into
that
arrangement
with
you
for
i
am
sure
you
have
forced
her
if
you
will
not
tell
me
why
then
i
shall
do
what
i
said
you
go
to
the
police
authorities
asked
pratt
ah
but
let
us
consider
things
a
little
miss
mallathorpe
now
to
start
with
who
says
there
has
been
any
forcing
i
know
one
person
who
wo
say
so
and
that
your
mother
herself
nesta
felt
unable
to
answer
that
assertion
and
pratt
smiled
triumphantly
and
went
on
she
tell
you
mallathorpe
tell
you
that
she
very
pleased
indeed
to
have
my
poor
services
he
said
she
knows
that
i
shall
serve
her
well
she
glad
to
do
a
kind
service
to
a
poor
relation
and
since
i
am
your
mother
relation
miss
mallathorpe
i
yours
too
i
some
degree
of
cousin
to
you
you
might
think
rather
better
rather
more
kindly
of
me
are
you
going
to
tell
me
anything
more
than
that
asked
nesta
steadily
pratt
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
waved
his
hands
what
more
can
i
tell
he
asked
the
fact
is
there
a
business
arrangement
between
me
and
your
mother
and
you
object
to
it
well
sorry
but
i
my
own
interests
to
consider
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
it
was
that
induced
my
mother
to
sign
that
paper
you
got
from
her
the
other
day
asked
nesta
can
i
say
more
than
that
it
was
a
business
arrangement
pleaded
pratt
there
nothing
unusual
in
one
party
in
a
business
arrangement
giving
a
power
of
attorney
to
another
party
nothing
very
well
said
nesta
rising
from
the
chair
and
looking
very
rigid
herself
as
she
stood
up
you
wo
tell
me
anything
so
i
am
now
going
to
the
police
i
do
know
what
they
do
i
know
what
they
can
do
but
i
can
tell
them
what
i
think
and
feel
about
this
at
any
rate
for
as
sure
as
i
am
that
i
see
you
there
something
wrong
and
i
know
what
it
is
pratt
recognized
that
she
had
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
mere
anger
to
one
of
calm
determination
and
as
she
marched
towards
the
door
he
called
her
back
as
the
result
of
a
second
swift
thought
on
his
part
miss
mallathorpe
he
said
oblige
me
by
sitting
down
again
i
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
your
going
to
the
police
but
my
experience
is
that
if
one
goes
to
them
on
errands
of
this
sort
it
sets
all
sorts
of
things
going
scandal
and
suspicion
and
i
do
know
what
you
want
any
scandal
sit
down
if
you
please
and
let
us
think
for
a
moment
and
i
see
if
i
can
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
nesta
already
had
a
hand
on
the
door
but
after
looking
at
him
for
a
second
or
two
she
turned
back
and
sat
down
in
her
old
position
and
pratt
still
seated
at
his
desk
plunged
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
tilted
back
his
chair
and
for
five
minutes
stared
with
knitted
brows
at
his
blotting
pad
a
queer
silence
fell
on
the
room
the
windows
were
no
sound
came
up
from
the
busy
street
below
but
on
the
mantelpiece
a
cheap
geneva
clock
ticked
and
ticked
and
nesta
felt
at
last
that
if
it
went
on
much
longer
without
the
accompaniment
of
a
human
voice
she
should
suddenly
snatch
it
up
and
hurl
it
anywhere
pratt
was
in
the
position
of
the
who
confronted
by
a
certain
turn
in
the
course
of
a
game
which
he
himself
feels
sure
he
is
bound
to
win
wonders
whether
he
had
better
not
expedite
matters
by
laying
his
cards
on
the
table
and
asking
his
opponent
if
he
can
possibly
beat
their
values
and
combination
he
had
carefully
reckoned
up
his
own
position
more
than
once
during
the
progress
of
recent
events
and
the
more
carefully
he
calculated
it
the
more
he
felt
convinced
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
he
had
had
to
alter
his
ground
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
harper
mallathorpe
and
he
had
known
that
he
would
have
to
fight
nesta
but
he
had
not
anticipated
that
hostilities
would
come
so
soon
or
begin
with
such
evident
determination
on
her
part
how
would
it
be
then
at
this
first
stage
to
make
such
a
demonstration
in
force
that
she
would
recognize
his
strength
he
looked
up
at
last
and
saw
nesta
regarding
him
sternly
but
pratt
smiled
the
quiet
smile
which
made
her
uneasy
miss
mallathorpe
he
said
i
was
thinking
of
two
things
just
then
a
game
at
cards
and
the
science
of
warfare
in
both
it
a
good
thing
sometimes
to
let
your
adversary
see
what
a
strong
hand
you
got
now
then
a
question
if
you
please
are
you
and
i
adversaries
yes
answered
nesta
unflinchingly
you
acting
like
an
enemy
you
are
an
enemy
i
hoped
that
you
and
i
would
be
friends
good
friends
said
pratt
with
something
like
a
sigh
and
if
i
may
say
so
i
no
feeling
of
enmity
towards
you
when
i
speak
of
us
being
adversaries
i
mean
it
in
well
let
say
a
sort
of
legal
sense
but
now
i
show
you
my
hand
that
is
as
far
as
i
please
will
you
listen
quietly
to
me
i
no
choice
replied
nesta
bluntly
and
i
came
here
to
know
what
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
say
it
pratt
moved
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
his
visitor
now
he
said
speaking
very
quietly
and
deliberately
i
go
through
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
carefully
point
by
point
i
shall
ask
you
to
go
back
a
little
way
it
is
now
some
time
since
i
discovered
a
secret
about
your
mother
mallathorpe
ah
you
start
it
may
be
with
indignation
but
i
assure
you
i
telling
you
and
am
going
to
tell
you
the
absolute
truth
i
say
a
secret
no
one
knows
it
but
myself
not
one
living
soul
except
of
course
your
mother
i
shall
not
reveal
it
to
you
under
any
consideration
or
in
any
circumstances
but
i
can
tell
you
this
if
that
secret
were
revealed
your
mother
would
be
ruined
for
life
and
you
yourself
would
suffer
in
more
ways
than
one
nesta
looked
at
him
incredulously
and
yet
she
began
to
feel
he
was
telling
some
truth
and
pratt
shook
his
head
at
the
incredulous
expression
it
quite
so
he
said
you
begin
to
believe
it
other
things
now
it
was
in
connection
with
this
that
i
paid
a
visit
to
normandale
grange
one
evening
some
months
ago
perhaps
you
never
heard
of
that
i
was
alone
with
your
mother
for
some
time
in
the
study
i
have
heard
of
it
she
answered
very
good
said
pratt
but
you
have
heard
that
your
mother
came
to
see
me
at
my
rooms
here
in
barford
my
lodgings
the
very
next
night
on
the
same
business
of
course
but
she
did
i
know
how
she
came
too
secretly
heavily
veiled
naturally
she
did
want
anybody
to
know
are
you
beginning
to
see
something
in
it
miss
mallathorpe
go
on
with
your
story
answered
nesta
i
go
on
then
to
the
day
before
your
brother
death
continued
pratt
namely
a
certain
friday
now
if
you
please
i
invite
you
to
listen
carefully
to
certain
facts
which
are
indisputable
which
i
can
prove
easily
on
that
friday
the
day
before
your
brother
death
mallathorpe
was
in
the
shrubbery
at
normandale
grange
which
is
near
the
north
end
of
the
old
she
was
approached
by
hoskins
an
old
woodman
who
has
been
on
the
estate
a
great
many
years
you
know
him
well
enough
hoskins
told
mallathorpe
that
the
between
the
north
and
south
shrubberies
spanning
the
cut
which
was
made
there
a
long
time
since
so
that
a
nearer
road
could
be
made
to
the
stables
was
in
an
extremely
dangerous
condition
so
dangerous
in
fact
that
in
his
opinion
it
would
collapse
under
even
a
moderate
weight
i
impress
this
fact
upon
you
strongly
well
said
nesta
hoskins
pratt
went
on
urged
upon
mallathorpe
the
necessity
of
having
the
bridge
closed
at
once
or
barricaded
he
pointed
out
to
her
from
where
they
stood
certain
places
in
the
bridge
and
in
the
railing
on
one
side
of
it
which
already
sagged
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
as
a
man
of
experience
knew
that
planks
and
railings
were
literally
rotten
with
damp
now
what
did
mallathorpe
do
she
said
nothing
to
hoskins
except
that
she
have
the
thing
seen
to
but
she
immediately
went
to
the
estate
carpenter
shop
and
there
she
procured
two
short
lengths
of
chain
and
two
padlocks
and
she
herself
went
back
to
the
and
secured
its
wicket
gates
at
both
ends
i
beg
you
will
bear
that
in
mind
too
miss
mallathorpe
i
am
bearing
everything
in
mind
said
nesta
resolutely
do
be
afraid
that
i
shall
forget
one
word
that
you
say
i
hear
that
sneer
in
your
voice
answered
pratt
as
he
turned
unlocked
a
drawer
and
drew
out
some
papers
but
i
think
you
will
soon
learn
that
the
sneer
at
what
i
telling
you
is
foolish
mallathorpe
had
a
set
purpose
in
locking
up
those
gates
as
you
will
see
presently
you
will
see
it
from
what
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
oblige
me
if
you
please
by
looking
at
that
letter
do
you
recognize
your
mother
handwriting
yes
admitted
nesta
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
apprehension
that
is
her
writing
very
good
said
pratt
then
before
i
read
it
to
you
i
just
tell
you
what
this
letter
is
it
formed
when
it
was
written
an
invitation
from
mallathorpe
to
me
an
invitation
to
walk
innocently
into
what
she
knew
knew
mind
you
to
be
a
she
meant
to
fall
through
the
bridge
chapter
xv
pratt
offers
a
hand
for
a
full
moment
of
tense
silence
nesta
and
pratt
looked
at
each
other
across
the
letter
which
he
held
in
his
outstretched
hand
looked
steadily
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
stern
inquiry
and
it
was
eyes
which
first
gave
way
beaten
by
the
certainty
in
pratt
she
looked
aside
her
cheeks
flamed
she
felt
as
if
something
were
rising
in
her
throat
to
choke
her
i
ca
believe
that
she
muttered
you
mistaken
oh
utterly
mistaken
no
mistake
said
pratt
confidently
i
tell
you
your
mother
meant
me
me
to
meet
my
death
at
that
bridge
here
the
proof
in
this
letter
i
tell
you
first
when
i
received
it
then
i
read
you
what
in
it
and
if
you
doubt
my
reading
of
it
you
shall
read
it
yourself
but
it
wo
go
out
of
my
hands
and
first
as
to
my
getting
it
for
that
important
it
reached
me
by
registered
post
mind
you
on
the
saturday
morning
on
which
your
brother
met
his
death
it
was
handed
in
at
normandale
village
for
registration
late
on
the
friday
afternoon
and
by
whom
do
you
think
i
do
know
replied
nesta
faintly
this
merciless
piling
up
of
details
was
beginning
to
frighten
her
already
she
felt
as
if
she
herself
were
some
criminal
forced
to
listen
from
the
dock
to
the
opening
address
of
a
prosecuting
counsel
how
should
i
know
how
can
i
think
it
was
handed
in
for
registration
by
your
mother
maid
esther
mawson
said
pratt
with
a
dark
look
i
got
her
evidence
anyway
and
that
was
all
part
of
a
plan
just
as
a
certain
something
that
was
enclosed
was
a
part
of
the
same
plan
a
plot
and
now
i
read
you
the
letter
and
you
bear
it
in
mind
that
i
got
it
by
first
post
that
saturday
morning
this
is
what
it
what
your
mother
says
i
particularly
wish
to
see
you
again
at
once
about
the
matter
between
us
and
to
have
another
look
at
can
you
come
here
bringing
it
with
you
tomorrow
saturday
afternoon
by
the
train
which
leaves
soon
after
two
as
i
am
most
anxious
that
your
visit
should
be
private
and
unknown
to
any
one
here
do
not
come
to
the
house
take
the
path
across
the
park
to
the
shrubberies
near
the
house
so
that
if
you
are
met
people
would
think
you
were
taking
a
near
cut
to
the
village
i
will
meet
you
in
the
shrubbery
on
the
house
side
of
the
little
the
gates
pratt
suddenly
paused
and
before
proceeding
looked
hard
at
his
visitor
now
listen
to
what
follows
and
bear
in
mind
what
your
mother
knew
and
had
done
at
the
time
she
wrote
this
letter
this
is
how
the
letter
goes
on
every
word
fix
itself
in
your
mind
miss
mallathorpe
gates
of
the
are
locked
but
the
enclosed
keys
will
open
them
i
will
meet
you
amongst
the
trees
on
the
further
side
be
sure
to
come
and
to
bring
i
have
something
to
say
about
it
on
seeing
it
again
pratt
turned
to
the
drawer
from
which
he
had
taken
the
letter
and
took
out
two
small
keys
evidently
belonging
to
patent
padlocks
he
held
them
up
before
nesta
there
they
are
he
said
triumphantly
been
in
my
possession
ever
since
and
will
remain
there
now
do
you
wish
to
read
the
letter
read
it
to
you
word
for
word
you
do
very
good
back
it
goes
in
there
with
these
keys
and
now
then
he
continued
having
replaced
letter
and
keys
in
his
drawer
and
turned
to
her
again
now
then
you
see
what
a
diabolical
scheme
it
was
that
was
in
your
mother
mind
against
me
she
meant
me
to
meet
with
the
fate
which
overtook
her
own
son
she
meant
me
to
fall
through
that
bridge
why
she
hoped
that
i
should
break
my
neck
as
he
did
she
wanted
to
silence
me
but
she
also
wanted
more
she
wanted
to
take
from
my
dead
body
or
my
unconscious
body
the
certain
something
which
she
was
so
anxious
i
should
bring
with
me
which
she
referred
to
as
she
was
willing
to
risk
anything
even
to
murder
to
get
hold
of
that
and
now
you
know
why
i
went
to
normandale
grange
that
saturday
you
know
now
the
real
reason
i
told
a
deliberate
lie
at
the
inquest
for
your
mother
sake
for
your
sake
if
you
know
it
i
did
not
go
there
to
hand
in
my
application
for
the
stewardship
i
went
in
response
to
the
letter
i
just
read
is
all
this
clear
to
you
nesta
could
only
move
her
head
in
silent
acquiescence
she
was
already
convinced
that
whether
all
this
was
entirely
true
or
not
there
was
truth
of
some
degree
in
what
pratt
had
told
her
and
she
was
thinking
of
her
mother
and
of
the
trap
which
she
certainly
appeared
to
have
laid
and
of
her
brother
fate
and
for
the
moment
she
felt
sick
and
beaten
but
pratt
went
on
in
that
cold
calculating
voice
telling
his
story
point
by
point
now
i
come
to
what
happened
that
saturday
afternoon
he
said
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
in
my
own
interest
i
have
carefully
collected
certain
evidence
which
never
came
out
at
the
inquest
which
indeed
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exact
matter
of
the
inquest
now
that
saturday
your
mother
and
you
had
lunch
together
your
brother
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
being
away
at
your
lunch
time
a
quarter
to
two
about
twenty
minutes
past
two
your
mother
left
the
house
she
went
out
into
the
gardens
she
left
the
gardens
for
the
shrubberies
and
at
minutes
to
three
she
was
seen
by
one
of
your
gardeners
featherstone
in
what
was
of
course
hiding
amongst
the
trees
at
the
end
of
the
north
shrubbery
what
was
she
doing
there
miss
mallathorpe
she
was
waiting
waiting
until
a
certain
accident
happened
to
me
then
she
would
come
out
of
her
in
the
hope
of
getting
that
document
from
my
pocket
do
you
see
how
cleverly
she
laid
her
plans
murderous
plans
nesta
was
making
a
great
effort
to
be
calm
she
knew
now
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
some
awful
mystery
which
could
only
be
solved
by
patience
and
strenuous
endeavour
she
knew
too
that
she
must
show
no
sign
of
fear
before
this
man
will
you
finish
your
story
if
you
please
she
asked
in
my
own
way
in
my
own
time
answered
pratt
i
now
come
to
your
mother
on
the
friday
noon
the
late
harper
mallathorpe
went
to
barford
to
visit
a
friend
young
stemthwaite
at
the
hollies
he
was
to
stay
the
night
there
and
was
not
expected
home
until
saturday
evening
he
did
stay
the
night
and
remained
in
barford
until
noon
on
saturday
but
he
unexpectedly
returned
to
the
house
at
half
past
two
and
almost
as
soon
as
he
got
in
he
picked
up
a
gun
and
strolled
out
into
the
gardens
and
the
north
shrubbery
and
as
you
know
he
went
to
the
you
see
miss
mallathorpe
your
mother
clever
as
she
was
had
forgotten
one
detail
the
gates
of
that
footbridge
were
merely
low
things
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
an
active
young
man
from
climbing
them
she
forgot
another
thing
too
that
warning
had
not
been
given
at
the
house
that
the
bridge
was
dangerous
and
of
course
she
never
never
calculated
that
your
brother
would
return
sooner
than
he
was
expected
or
that
on
his
return
he
go
where
he
did
and
so
but
i
spare
you
any
reference
to
what
happened
only
you
know
now
how
it
was
that
mallathorpe
was
found
by
her
son
body
been
waiting
about
for
me
but
the
fate
she
meant
for
me
was
dealt
out
to
him
in
spite
of
herself
nesta
gave
way
to
a
slight
cry
i
ca
bear
any
more
of
that
she
said
have
you
finished
there
not
much
more
to
say
now
at
any
rate
replied
pratt
and
what
i
have
to
say
shall
be
to
the
point
i
sorry
enough
to
have
been
obliged
to
say
all
that
i
have
said
but
you
know
you
forced
me
to
it
you
threatened
me
the
real
truth
miss
mallathorpe
is
just
this
you
do
understand
me
at
all
you
come
here
excuse
my
plain
speech
hectoring
and
bullying
me
with
talk
about
the
police
and
blackmail
and
i
do
know
what
it
i
who
ought
to
go
to
the
police
i
could
have
your
mother
arrested
and
put
in
the
dock
on
a
charge
of
attempted
murder
this
very
day
i
got
all
the
proofs
i
suppose
you
held
that
out
as
a
threat
to
her
when
you
forced
her
to
sign
that
power
of
attorney
observed
nesta
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
pratt
looked
at
his
visitor
in
an
unfriendly
fashion
his
expression
changed
and
his
face
flushed
a
little
you
think
that
do
you
he
said
well
you
wrong
i
not
a
fool
i
held
out
no
such
threat
i
did
even
tell
your
mother
what
i
found
out
i
was
going
to
show
her
my
hand
all
at
once
though
i
shown
you
a
good
deal
of
it
not
all
she
asked
quickly
not
all
answered
pratt
with
a
meaning
glance
to
use
more
metaphors
i
several
cards
up
my
sleeve
miss
mallathorpe
but
utterly
wrong
about
the
threats
i
tell
you
i
do
mind
that
how
i
got
the
authority
you
speaking
about
your
mother
had
promised
me
that
stewardship
for
life
i
have
been
a
good
steward
but
we
recognized
that
your
brother
death
had
altered
things
that
you
being
as
she
said
a
young
woman
you
see
how
plain
i
am
would
insist
on
looking
after
your
own
affairs
so
she
gave
me
another
post
i
discharge
its
duties
honestly
yes
said
nesta
but
you
already
told
me
that
you
a
hold
on
my
mother
before
any
of
these
recent
events
happened
and
that
you
possess
some
document
which
she
was
anxious
to
get
into
her
hands
so
it
comes
to
this
you
a
double
hold
on
her
according
to
your
story
just
so
agreed
pratt
you
right
i
have
a
double
hold
nesta
looked
at
him
silently
for
a
while
pratt
looked
at
her
very
well
she
said
at
last
how
much
do
you
want
to
be
bought
out
pratt
laughed
i
thought
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
he
remarked
yes
i
thought
so
name
your
price
said
nesta
miss
mallathorpe
answered
pratt
bending
forward
and
speaking
with
a
new
earnestness
just
listen
to
me
it
no
good
i
not
to
be
bought
out
your
mother
tried
that
game
with
me
before
she
offered
me
first
five
then
ten
thousand
pounds
cash
down
for
that
document
when
she
came
to
see
me
at
my
rooms
i
dare
say
she
have
gone
to
twenty
thousand
and
found
the
money
there
and
then
but
i
said
no
then
and
i
say
no
to
you
i
not
to
be
purchased
in
that
way
i
my
own
ideas
my
own
plans
my
own
ambitions
my
own
hopes
it
not
any
use
at
all
for
you
to
dangle
your
money
before
me
but
i
suggest
something
else
that
you
can
do
nesta
made
no
answer
she
continued
to
look
steadily
at
the
man
who
evidently
had
her
mother
in
his
power
and
pratt
who
was
watching
her
intently
went
on
speaking
quietly
but
with
some
intensity
of
tone
you
can
do
this
he
said
to
start
with
and
it
go
a
long
way
just
try
and
think
better
of
me
i
told
you
you
do
understand
me
try
to
i
not
a
bad
lot
i
great
abilities
i
a
hard
worker
eldrick
pascoe
could
tell
you
that
i
scrupulously
honest
in
money
matters
you
see
that
i
look
after
your
mother
affairs
in
a
fashion
that
commend
itself
to
any
firm
of
auditors
and
accountants
who
may
look
into
my
accounts
every
year
i
only
taking
the
salary
from
her
that
i
was
to
have
had
for
the
stewardship
so
why
not
leave
it
at
that
let
things
be
perhaps
in
time
you
come
to
see
that
to
be
trusted
how
can
i
trust
a
man
who
deliberately
tells
me
that
he
holds
a
secret
and
a
document
over
a
woman
head
demanded
nesta
you
admitted
a
previous
hold
on
my
mother
you
say
you
in
possession
of
a
secret
that
would
ruin
her
quite
apart
from
recent
events
is
that
honest
it
was
none
of
my
seeking
retorted
pratt
i
gained
the
knowledge
by
accident
you
giving
yourself
away
said
nesta
or
you
some
mental
twist
or
defect
which
prevents
you
from
seeing
things
straight
it
not
how
you
got
your
knowledge
but
the
use
you
making
of
it
that
the
important
thing
you
using
it
to
force
my
mother
to
excuse
me
interrupted
pratt
with
a
queer
smile
it
you
who
see
things
straight
i
using
my
knowledge
to
protect
all
of
you
let
your
mind
go
back
to
what
was
said
at
first
to
what
i
said
at
first
i
said
that
i
discovered
a
secret
which
if
revealed
would
ruin
your
mother
and
injure
you
so
it
would
more
than
ever
now
so
you
see
in
keeping
it
i
taking
care
not
only
of
her
interests
but
of
yours
nesta
rose
she
realized
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
or
done
and
pratt
rose
too
and
looked
at
her
almost
appealingly
i
wish
you
try
to
see
things
as
i
put
them
miss
mallathorpe
he
said
i
do
bear
malice
against
your
mother
for
that
scheme
she
contrived
i
willing
to
put
it
clear
out
of
my
head
why
not
accept
things
as
they
are
i
keep
that
secret
for
ever
no
one
shall
ever
know
about
it
why
not
be
friends
now
why
not
shake
hands
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
but
nesta
drew
back
no
she
said
my
opinion
is
just
what
it
was
when
i
came
here
before
pratt
could
move
she
had
turned
swiftly
to
the
door
and
let
herself
out
and
in
another
minute
she
was
amongst
the
crowds
in
the
street
below
for
a
few
minutes
she
walked
in
the
direction
of
offices
but
when
she
had
nearly
reached
them
she
turned
and
went
deliberately
to
those
of
eldrick
pascoe
chapter
xvi
a
headquarters
conference
by
the
time
she
had
been
admitted
to
eldrick
private
room
nesta
had
regained
her
composure
she
had
also
had
time
to
think
and
her
present
action
was
the
result
of
at
any
rate
a
part
of
her
thoughts
she
was
calm
and
collected
enough
when
she
took
the
chair
which
the
solicitor
drew
forward
i
called
on
you
for
two
reasons
eldrick
she
said
first
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
at
the
time
of
my
brother
death
in
sending
your
clerk
to
help
in
making
the
arrangements
very
glad
he
was
of
any
assistance
miss
mallathorpe
answered
eldrick
i
thought
of
course
that
as
he
had
been
on
the
spot
as
it
were
when
the
accident
happened
he
could
do
a
few
little
things
he
was
very
useful
in
that
way
said
nesta
and
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
him
but
the
second
reason
for
my
call
is
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
him
yes
responded
eldrick
he
had
already
formed
some
idea
as
to
what
was
in
his
visitor
mind
and
he
was
secretly
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
talking
to
her
about
pratt
eh
what
about
him
miss
mallathorpe
he
was
with
you
for
some
years
i
believe
she
asked
a
good
many
years
answered
eldrick
he
came
to
us
as
and
was
when
he
left
us
then
you
ought
to
know
him
well
she
suggested
as
to
that
replied
eldrick
there
are
some
people
in
this
world
whom
other
people
never
could
know
well
that
to
say
really
well
i
know
pratt
well
enough
for
what
he
was
our
clerk
privately
i
know
little
about
him
he
clever
he
ability
he
a
chap
who
reads
a
good
deal
he
got
ambitions
and
i
should
say
he
is
a
bit
subtle
deceitful
she
asked
i
could
say
that
replied
eldrick
it
would
be
true
if
i
said
so
i
think
he
possibilities
of
strategy
in
him
but
so
far
as
concerned
we
found
him
hardworking
energetic
truthful
dependable
and
honest
and
absolutely
to
be
trusted
in
money
matters
he
had
many
and
many
a
thousand
pounds
of
ours
through
his
hands
i
believe
you
unaware
that
my
mother
for
some
reason
or
other
unknown
to
me
has
put
him
in
charge
of
her
affairs
asked
nesta
yes
collingwood
told
me
so
answered
eldrick
so
too
did
your
own
solicitor
robson
who
very
angry
about
it
and
you
she
said
putting
a
direct
question
what
do
you
think
do
please
tell
me
it
difficult
to
say
miss
mallathorpe
replied
eldrick
with
a
smile
and
a
shake
of
the
head
if
your
mother
who
of
course
is
quite
competent
to
decide
for
herself
wishes
to
have
somebody
to
look
after
her
affairs
i
do
see
what
objection
can
be
taken
to
her
procedure
and
if
she
chooses
to
put
linford
pratt
in
that
position
why
not
as
i
tell
you
i
as
his
last
and
only
employer
am
quite
convinced
of
his
abilities
and
probity
i
suppose
that
as
your
mother
agent
supervise
her
property
collect
money
due
to
her
advise
her
in
investments
and
so
on
well
i
should
say
personally
mind
he
quite
competent
to
do
all
that
and
that
he
do
it
honestly
i
should
certainly
say
so
but
why
should
he
do
it
at
all
asked
nesta
eldrick
waved
his
hands
ah
he
exclaimed
now
you
ask
me
a
very
different
question
but
i
understand
in
fact
i
know
that
pratt
turns
out
to
be
a
relation
of
yours
distant
but
it
there
perhaps
your
mother
who
of
course
is
much
better
off
since
your
brother
sad
death
is
desirous
of
benefiting
pratt
as
a
relation
do
you
advise
anything
asked
nesta
well
you
know
miss
mallathorpe
replied
eldrick
smiling
i
not
your
legal
adviser
what
about
mr
robson
robson
is
so
very
angry
about
all
this
with
my
mother
said
nesta
that
i
do
even
want
to
ask
his
advice
what
i
really
do
want
is
the
advice
counsel
of
somebody
perhaps
more
as
a
friend
than
as
a
solicitor
delighted
to
give
you
any
help
i
can
either
professionally
or
as
a
friend
exclaimed
eldrick
but
let
me
suggest
something
and
first
of
all
is
there
anything
something
in
all
this
that
you
have
told
to
anybody
yet
yes
much
she
answered
a
great
deal
then
said
eldrick
let
me
advise
a
certain
counsel
two
heads
are
better
than
one
let
me
ask
collingwood
to
come
here
he
was
watching
his
visitor
narrowly
as
he
said
this
and
he
saw
a
faint
rise
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
but
for
the
moment
she
did
not
answer
and
eldrick
saw
that
she
was
thinking
i
can
get
him
across
from
his
chambers
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
he
sure
to
be
in
just
now
can
i
have
a
few
minutes
to
decide
asked
nesta
eldrick
jumped
up
of
course
he
said
i
leave
you
a
while
it
so
happens
i
want
to
see
my
partner
i
go
up
to
his
room
and
return
to
you
presently
nesta
left
alone
gave
herself
up
to
deep
thought
and
to
a
careful
reckoning
of
her
position
she
was
longing
to
confide
in
some
trustworthy
person
or
persons
for
pratt
revelations
had
plunged
her
into
a
maze
of
perplexity
but
her
difficulties
were
many
first
of
all
she
would
have
to
tell
all
about
the
terrible
charge
brought
by
pratt
against
her
mother
then
about
the
second
which
he
professed
to
or
probably
did
hold
what
sort
of
a
secret
could
it
be
and
supposing
her
advisers
suggested
strong
measures
against
pratt
what
then
about
the
danger
to
her
mother
in
a
twofold
direction
would
it
be
better
wiser
if
she
kept
all
this
to
herself
at
present
and
waited
for
events
to
develop
but
at
the
mere
thought
of
that
she
shrank
feeling
mentally
and
physically
afraid
to
keep
all
that
knowledge
to
herself
to
brood
over
it
in
secret
to
wonder
what
it
all
meant
what
lay
beneath
what
might
develop
that
was
more
than
she
felt
able
to
bear
and
when
eldrick
came
back
she
looked
at
him
and
nodded
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
and
collingwood
she
said
quietly
collingwood
came
across
to
eldrick
office
at
once
and
to
these
two
nesta
unbosomed
herself
of
every
detail
that
she
could
remember
of
her
interview
with
pratt
and
as
she
went
on
from
one
thing
to
another
she
saw
the
men
faces
grow
graver
and
graver
and
realized
that
this
was
a
more
anxious
matter
than
she
had
thought
that
all
she
said
in
the
end
i
do
think
i
forgotten
anything
and
even
now
i
do
know
if
i
done
right
to
tell
you
all
this
but
i
do
think
i
could
have
faced
it
alone
my
dear
miss
mallathorpe
said
eldrick
earnestly
you
done
the
wisest
thing
you
probably
ever
did
in
your
life
now
he
went
on
looking
at
collingwood
just
let
us
all
three
realize
what
is
to
me
a
more
important
fact
nobody
would
be
more
astonished
than
pratt
to
know
that
you
have
taken
the
wise
step
you
have
you
agree
collingwood
yes
answered
collingwood
after
a
moment
reflection
i
think
so
miss
mallathorpe
does
quite
see
what
we
mean
said
eldrick
turning
to
nesta
we
mean
that
pratt
firmly
believed
when
he
told
you
what
he
did
that
for
your
mother
sake
and
your
own
you
would
keep
his
communication
a
dead
secret
he
firmly
believed
that
you
would
never
dare
to
tell
anybody
what
he
told
you
most
people
in
your
position
would
have
told
they
have
let
the
secret
eat
their
lives
out
you
a
wise
and
a
sensible
young
woman
and
the
thing
is
we
must
let
pratt
remain
under
the
impression
that
you
are
keeping
your
knowledge
to
yourself
let
him
continue
to
believe
that
you
remain
silent
under
fear
and
let
us
meet
his
secret
policy
with
a
secret
strategy
of
our
own
again
he
glanced
at
collingwood
and
again
collingwood
nodded
assent
now
continued
eldrick
just
let
us
consider
matters
for
a
few
minutes
from
the
position
which
has
newly
arisen
to
begin
with
account
of
your
mother
dealings
about
the
is
a
very
clever
and
plausible
one
i
can
see
quite
well
that
it
has
caused
you
great
pain
so
before
i
go
any
further
just
let
me
say
this
to
you
do
you
attach
one
word
of
importance
to
it
nesta
uttered
a
heartfelt
cry
of
relief
oh
she
exclaimed
if
you
knew
how
thankful
i
should
be
to
know
that
it
all
lies
that
he
was
lying
can
i
really
think
that
after
what
i
saw
i
wo
ask
you
to
think
that
he
telling
lies
just
now
answered
eldrick
with
a
glance
at
collingwood
but
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
your
mother
could
put
a
totally
different
aspect
and
complexion
on
all
her
actions
and
words
in
connection
with
the
entire
affair
my
impression
of
course
he
went
on
with
something
very
like
a
wink
at
collingwood
is
that
mallathorpe
when
she
wrote
that
letter
to
pratt
intended
to
have
the
bridge
mended
first
thing
next
morning
and
that
something
prevented
that
being
done
and
that
when
she
was
seen
about
the
shrubberies
in
the
afternoon
she
was
on
her
way
to
meet
pratt
before
he
could
reach
the
dangerous
point
so
that
she
could
warn
him
what
do
you
say
collingwood
i
should
say
answered
collingwood
regarding
the
solicitor
earnestly
and
speaking
with
great
gravity
of
manner
that
that
would
make
an
admirable
line
of
defence
to
any
charge
which
pratt
was
wicked
enough
to
prefer
you
do
think
my
mother
meant
meant
to
exclaimed
nesta
eagerly
turning
from
one
man
to
the
other
you
do
there
is
no
evidence
worth
twopence
against
your
mother
replied
eldrick
soothingly
put
everything
that
pratt
has
said
against
her
clear
out
of
your
mind
put
all
recent
events
out
of
your
mind
interfere
with
pratt
just
now
the
thing
to
be
done
about
pratt
is
this
and
it
the
only
thing
we
must
find
out
exactly
as
secretly
as
possible
what
this
secret
is
of
which
he
speaks
what
is
this
hold
on
mallathorpe
what
is
this
document
to
which
he
refers
in
other
words
we
must
work
back
to
some
point
which
at
present
we
ca
see
at
least
i
ca
see
it
but
we
may
discover
it
what
do
you
say
collingwood
i
agree
entirely
answered
collingwood
let
pratt
rest
in
his
fancied
security
the
thing
is
certainly
to
go
back
but
to
what
point
that
we
must
consider
later
said
eldrick
now
for
the
present
miss
mallathorpe
you
are
i
suppose
going
back
home
yes
at
once
answered
nesta
i
have
my
car
at
the
i
should
just
like
to
know
something
continued
eldrick
again
looking
at
collingwood
as
if
for
approval
that
is
mallathorpe
present
disposition
towards
affairs
in
general
and
pratt
in
particular
miss
mallathorpe
just
do
something
which
i
will
now
suggest
to
you
when
you
reach
home
see
your
mother
she
is
still
i
understand
an
invalid
though
evidently
able
to
transact
business
just
approach
her
gently
and
kindly
and
tell
her
that
you
are
a
little
should
we
say
uncomfortable
about
certain
business
arrangements
which
you
hear
she
has
made
with
pratt
and
ask
her
if
she
wo
talk
them
over
with
you
and
give
you
her
full
confidence
it
now
twelve
continued
eldrick
looking
at
his
watch
you
be
home
before
lunch
see
your
mother
early
in
the
afternoon
and
then
telephone
briefly
the
result
to
me
here
at
four
then
collingwood
and
i
will
have
a
consultation
he
motioned
collingwood
to
remain
where
he
was
and
himself
saw
nesta
down
to
the
street
when
he
came
back
to
his
room
he
shook
his
head
at
the
young
barrister
collingwood
he
said
there
some
dreadful
business
afloat
in
all
this
and
it
all
the
worse
because
of
the
fashion
in
which
pratt
talked
to
that
girl
she
evidently
a
very
good
memory
she
narrated
that
conversation
clearly
and
fully
pratt
must
be
very
sure
of
his
hand
if
he
showed
her
his
cards
in
that
way
his
very
confidence
in
himself
shows
what
a
subtle
network
he
either
made
or
is
making
i
question
if
he
very
much
care
if
he
knew
that
we
know
but
he
must
know
that
yet
we
must
reply
to
his
mine
with
a
what
do
you
think
of
pratt
charge
against
mrs
mallathorpe
asked
collingwood
eldrick
made
a
wry
face
looks
bad
very
very
bad
collingwood
he
answered
art
and
scheme
of
a
desperate
woman
of
course
but
we
must
let
her
daughter
think
we
believe
it
let
her
stick
to
the
suggestion
i
made
which
as
you
remarked
would
certainly
make
a
very
good
line
of
defence
supposing
pratt
even
did
accuse
her
but
now
what
on
earth
is
this
document
that
been
mentioned
this
paper
of
which
pratt
has
possession
has
mallathorpe
at
some
time
committed
forgery
or
bigamy
or
what
is
it
one
thing
sure
however
we
got
to
work
quietly
we
must
let
pratt
know
that
we
working
i
hope
he
does
know
that
miss
mallathorpe
came
here
will
you
come
back
about
four
and
hear
what
message
she
sends
me
after
that
we
could
consult
collingwood
went
away
to
his
chambers
he
was
much
occupied
just
then
and
had
little
time
to
think
of
anything
but
the
work
in
hand
but
as
he
ate
his
lunch
at
the
club
which
he
had
joined
on
settling
in
barford
he
tried
to
get
at
some
notion
of
the
state
of
things
and
once
more
his
mind
reverted
to
the
time
of
his
grandfather
death
and
his
own
suspicions
about
pratt
at
that
period
clearly
that
was
a
point
to
which
they
must
hark
back
he
himself
must
make
more
inquiries
about
the
circumstances
of
antony
bartle
last
hours
for
this
affair
would
not
have
to
rest
where
it
was
it
was
intolerable
that
nesta
mallathorpe
should
in
any
way
be
under
pratt
power
he
went
back
to
eldrick
at
four
with
a
suggestion
or
two
in
his
mind
and
at
the
sight
of
him
eldrick
shook
his
head
i
had
that
telephone
message
from
normandale
he
said
five
minutes
ago
pretty
much
what
i
expected
at
this
juncture
anyway
mallathorpe
absolutely
declines
to
talk
business
with
even
her
daughter
at
present
and
earnestly
desires
that
linford
pratt
may
be
left
alone
well
asked
collingwood
after
a
pause
what
now
we
must
do
what
we
can
secretly
privately
for
the
daughter
sake
said
eldrick
i
confess
i
do
quite
see
a
beginning
but
just
then
the
private
door
opened
and
pascoe
a
somewhat
man
who
always
looked
and
was
in
reality
remarkably
lounged
in
nodded
to
collingwood
and
threw
a
newspaper
in
front
of
his
partner
i
say
eldrick
he
drawled
as
he
removed
a
cigar
from
his
lips
there
an
advertisement
here
which
seems
to
refer
to
that
precious
protégé
of
yours
who
left
you
with
such
scant
ceremony
same
name
anyhow
eldrick
snatched
up
the
paper
glanced
at
it
and
read
a
few
words
aloud
information
wanted
about
james
parrawhite
at
one
time
in
practice
as
a
solicitor
chapter
xvii
advertisement
eldrick
looked
up
at
his
partner
with
a
sharp
confirmatory
glance
that
our
parrawhite
of
course
he
said
who
after
him
now
and
he
went
on
to
read
the
rest
of
the
advertisement
murmuring
its
phraseology
practice
as
a
solicitor
at
nottingham
and
who
left
that
town
six
years
ago
if
the
said
james
parrawhite
will
communicate
with
the
undersigned
he
will
hear
something
greatly
to
his
advantage
any
person
able
to
give
information
as
to
his
whereabouts
will
be
suitably
rewarded
apply
to
halstead
byner
chambers
london
um
pascoe
hand
over
that
law
list
collingwood
looked
on
in
silence
while
eldrick
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
big
book
which
his
partner
took
down
from
a
shelf
he
wondered
at
eldrick
apparent
and
almost
eager
interest
halstead
byner
are
not
solicitors
announced
eldrick
presently
they
must
be
inquiry
agents
or
something
of
that
sort
anyway
write
to
them
pascoe
at
once
you
do
know
where
the
fellow
is
said
pascoe
what
the
good
no
but
we
know
where
he
last
was
retorted
eldrick
he
turned
to
collingwood
as
the
junior
partner
sauntered
out
of
the
room
rather
odd
that
pascoe
should
draw
my
attention
to
that
just
now
he
remarked
this
man
parrawhite
was
in
a
certain
sense
mixed
up
with
pratt
at
least
pratt
and
i
are
the
only
two
people
who
know
the
secret
of
parrawhite
disappearance
from
these
offices
that
was
just
about
the
time
of
your
grandfather
death
collingwood
immediately
became
attentive
his
first
suspicions
of
pratt
were
formed
at
the
time
of
which
eldrick
spoke
and
any
reference
to
events
contemporary
excited
his
interest
who
was
or
is
this
man
you
talking
of
he
asked
bad
lot
very
answered
eldrick
shaking
his
head
he
and
i
were
articled
together
at
the
same
time
to
the
same
people
we
saw
a
lot
of
each
other
as
fellow
articled
clerks
he
afterwards
practised
in
nottingham
and
he
held
some
good
appointments
but
he
a
perfect
mania
for
gambling
the
turf
and
he
went
utterly
wrong
and
misappropriated
clients
money
and
in
the
end
he
got
into
prison
and
was
of
course
struck
off
the
rolls
i
never
heard
anything
of
him
for
years
and
then
one
day
some
time
ago
he
turned
up
here
and
begged
me
to
give
him
a
job
i
did
and
i
do
him
the
credit
to
say
that
he
earned
his
money
but
in
the
end
his
natural
badness
broke
out
one
afternoon
careless
about
some
things
i
left
some
money
lying
in
this
drawer
about
forty
pounds
in
notes
and
gold
and
next
morning
parrawhite
never
came
to
business
we
never
seen
or
heard
of
him
since
you
mentioned
pratt
said
collingwood
only
pratt
and
i
know
about
the
money
replied
eldrick
we
kept
it
secret
i
did
want
pascoe
to
know
i
been
so
careless
pascoe
like
parrawhite
and
he
does
know
his
record
i
only
told
him
that
parrawhite
was
a
chap
i
known
in
better
circumstances
and
wanted
to
give
a
hand
to
you
said
it
was
about
the
time
of
my
grandfather
death
asked
collingwood
it
was
just
about
then
between
his
death
and
his
funeral
i
should
say
answered
eldrick
the
two
events
are
associated
in
my
mind
anyway
i
like
to
know
what
it
is
that
these
people
want
parrawhite
for
if
it
money
that
come
to
him
it
be
of
no
advantage
only
go
where
all
the
rest
gone
collingwood
lost
interest
in
parrawhite
parrawhite
appeared
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
affairs
in
which
he
was
interested
he
sat
down
and
began
to
tell
eldrick
about
his
own
suspicions
of
pratt
at
the
time
of
antony
bartle
death
of
what
jabey
naylor
had
told
him
about
the
paper
taken
from
the
of
of
the
lad
account
of
the
old
man
doings
immediately
afterwards
and
of
his
own
proceedings
which
had
led
him
to
believe
for
the
time
being
that
his
suspicions
were
groundless
but
now
he
went
on
a
new
idea
occurs
to
me
suppose
that
that
paper
found
by
my
grandfather
in
a
book
which
had
certainly
belonged
to
the
late
john
mallathorpe
was
something
important
relating
to
mallathorpe
suppose
that
my
grandfather
brought
it
across
here
to
you
suppose
that
finding
you
out
he
showed
it
to
pratt
as
my
grandfather
died
suddenly
with
nobody
but
pratt
there
what
was
there
to
prevent
pratt
from
appropriating
that
paper
if
he
saw
that
it
would
give
him
a
hold
over
mallathorpe
we
know
now
that
he
has
some
document
in
his
possession
which
does
give
him
a
hold
may
it
not
be
that
of
which
the
boy
naylor
told
me
might
be
agreed
eldrick
but
my
opinion
is
taking
things
all
together
that
the
paper
which
antony
bartle
found
was
the
one
you
yourself
discovered
later
the
list
of
books
no
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
believe
that
the
document
which
pratt
told
miss
mallathorpe
he
holds
and
to
which
her
mother
referred
in
the
letter
asking
pratt
to
meet
her
is
probably
most
probably
one
which
he
discovered
in
searching
out
his
relationship
to
mallathorpe
he
a
cute
chap
and
he
may
have
found
some
document
which
well
i
tell
you
what
it
might
be
something
which
would
upset
the
rights
of
harper
mallathorpe
to
his
uncle
estates
no
other
relatives
came
forward
or
were
heard
of
or
were
discoverable
when
john
mallathorpe
was
killed
in
that
chimney
accident
but
there
may
be
some
there
may
be
one
in
particular
that
my
notion
and
i
intend
in
the
first
place
to
make
a
personal
search
of
the
parish
registers
from
which
pratt
got
his
information
he
may
have
discovered
something
there
which
he
keeping
to
himself
you
think
that
is
the
course
to
adopt
asked
collingwood
after
a
moment
reflection
at
present
yes
replied
eldrick
and
while
i
making
it
i
do
it
myself
we
just
go
on
outwardly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
if
i
meet
pratt
as
i
shall
i
shall
not
let
him
see
that
i
know
anything
do
you
go
on
in
just
the
usual
way
go
out
to
normandale
grange
now
and
then
and
tell
miss
mallathorpe
to
think
no
more
of
her
interview
with
pratt
until
we
something
to
talk
to
her
about
you
talk
to
her
about
something
else
when
collingwood
had
left
him
eldrick
laid
a
telegram
form
on
his
plotting
pad
and
after
a
brief
interval
of
thought
wrote
out
a
message
addressed
to
the
people
whose
advertisement
had
attracted
attention
halstead
byner
martin
chambers
london
i
can
give
you
definite
information
concerning
james
parrawhite
if
you
will
send
representative
to
see
me
personally
charles
eldrick
eldrick
pascoe
solicitors
barford
after
eldrick
had
sent
off
a
clerk
with
this
message
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
he
sat
thinking
for
some
time
and
at
the
close
of
his
meditations
and
after
some
turning
over
of
a
diary
which
lay
on
his
desk
he
picked
up
pen
and
paper
and
drafted
an
advertisement
of
his
own
ten
pounds
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
who
can
give
reliable
and
useful
information
as
to
james
parrawhite
who
until
november
last
was
a
clerk
in
the
employ
of
eldrick
pascoe
solicitors
barford
and
who
is
believed
to
have
left
the
town
on
the
evening
of
november
apply
to
charles
eldrick
of
the
above
firm
worth
risking
ten
pounds
on
anyway
muttered
eldrick
whether
these
london
people
will
cover
it
or
not
here
he
went
on
turning
to
a
clerk
who
had
just
entered
the
room
make
three
copies
of
this
advertisement
and
take
one
to
each
of
the
three
newspaper
offices
and
tell
to
put
it
in
their
personal
column
tonight
he
sat
musing
for
some
time
after
he
was
left
alone
again
and
when
he
at
last
rose
it
was
with
a
shake
of
the
head
i
wonder
if
pratt
told
me
the
truth
that
morning
he
said
to
himself
anyway
he
now
being
proved
to
be
even
deeper
than
i
ever
considered
him
well
other
folk
than
pratt
are
possessed
of
pretty
good
wits
before
he
left
the
office
that
evening
eldrick
was
handed
a
telegram
from
halstead
byner
of
martin
chambers
informing
him
that
their
byner
would
travel
to
barford
by
the
first
express
next
morning
and
would
call
upon
him
at
eleven
then
they
have
some
important
news
for
parrawhite
mused
eldrick
as
he
put
the
message
in
his
pocket
and
went
off
to
his
club
inquiry
agents
do
set
off
on
long
journeys
at
a
moment
notice
for
a
matter
of
a
trifling
agency
but
where
is
parrawhite
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
byner
next
morning
with
considerable
curiosity
and
soon
after
eleven
there
was
shown
in
to
him
a
smart
young
man
who
having
introduced
himself
as
gerald
byner
immediately
plunged
into
business
you
can
tell
me
something
of
james
parrawhite
mr
eldrick
he
began
we
shall
be
glad
we
been
endeavouring
to
trace
him
for
some
months
it
odd
that
you
did
see
our
advertisement
before
i
do
look
at
that
sort
of
advertisement
replied
eldrick
i
believe
it
was
by
mere
accident
that
my
partner
saw
yours
yesterday
afternoon
but
now
a
question
or
two
first
what
are
you
inquiry
agents
just
so
sir
inquiry
agents
with
a
touch
of
private
detective
business
answered
gerald
byner
with
a
smile
we
undertake
to
find
people
to
watch
people
to
recover
lost
property
and
so
on
in
this
case
we
acting
for
vickers
marshall
hebbleton
solicitors
of
cannon
street
they
want
james
parrawhite
badly
why
asked
eldrick
because
replied
byner
with
a
dry
laugh
there
about
twenty
thousand
pounds
waiting
for
him
in
their
hands
eldrick
whistled
with
astonishment
whew
he
said
twenty
thousand
for
parrawhite
my
good
sir
if
that
so
and
if
as
you
say
you
been
advertising
advertising
in
several
papers
interrupted
byner
dailies
weeklies
provincials
never
had
one
reply
till
your
wire
then
parrawhite
must
be
dead
said
eldrick
or
in
gaol
under
another
name
twenty
thousand
pounds
waiting
for
parrawhite
if
parrawhite
was
alive
man
or
at
liberty
he
would
let
twenty
thousand
pence
wait
five
minutes
i
know
him
what
can
you
tell
me
mr
eldrick
asked
the
inquiry
agent
eldrick
told
all
he
knew
concealing
nothing
and
byner
listened
silently
and
eagerly
there
something
strikes
me
at
once
he
said
you
say
that
with
him
disappeared
three
or
four
notes
of
yours
have
you
the
numbers
of
those
notes
i
ca
say
replied
eldrick
doubtfully
i
have
certainly
but
they
were
paid
in
to
our
pratt
and
i
think
he
used
to
enter
such
things
in
a
sort
of
i
get
it
he
went
into
the
clerks
office
and
presently
returned
with
an
oblong
book
which
he
began
to
turn
over
this
may
be
what
you
ask
about
he
said
at
last
here
under
date
november
are
some
letters
and
figures
which
obviously
refer
to
you
can
copy
them
if
you
like
another
question
eldrick
remarked
byner
as
he
made
a
note
of
the
entries
you
say
some
cheque
forms
were
abstracted
from
a
book
of
yours
at
the
same
time
have
you
ever
heard
of
any
of
these
cheque
forms
being
made
use
of
never
replied
eldrick
no
forgery
of
your
name
or
anything
suggested
the
caller
no
said
eldrick
there
been
nothing
of
that
sort
i
can
soon
ascertain
if
these
have
reached
the
bank
of
england
said
byner
that
a
simple
matter
now
suppose
they
have
well
asked
eldrick
you
know
of
course
continued
byner
that
it
does
take
long
for
a
bank
of
england
note
once
issued
to
get
back
to
the
bank
you
know
too
that
it
never
issued
again
now
if
those
notes
have
been
presented
at
the
bank
where
are
they
and
if
no
use
has
been
made
of
your
stolen
cheques
where
are
they
good
agreed
eldrick
i
see
that
you
ought
to
do
well
in
your
special
line
of
business
now
are
you
going
to
pursue
inquiries
for
parrawhite
here
in
barford
after
what
i
told
you
certainly
said
byner
i
came
down
prepared
to
stop
awhile
highly
important
that
this
man
should
be
found
highly
important
he
added
smiling
to
other
people
than
parrawhite
himself
in
what
way
asked
eldrick
why
replied
byner
if
he
dead
as
he
may
be
this
money
goes
to
somebody
else
a
relative
the
relative
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
he
is
dead
but
definite
news
will
be
welcome
in
any
case
oh
yes
now
that
i
got
down
here
i
shall
do
my
best
to
trace
him
you
have
the
address
of
the
woman
he
lodged
with
you
say
i
shall
go
there
first
of
course
then
i
must
try
to
find
out
what
he
did
with
himself
in
his
spare
time
but
from
all
you
tell
me
it
my
impression
dead
unless
as
you
say
he
got
into
prison
again
possibly
under
another
name
it
seems
impossible
that
he
should
not
have
seen
our
advertisements
you
never
advertised
in
any
yorkshire
newspapers
asked
eldrick
no
said
byner
because
we
no
knowledge
of
his
having
come
so
far
north
we
advertised
in
the
midland
papers
but
then
all
the
london
papers
daily
and
weekly
that
we
used
come
down
to
yorkshire
parrawhite
said
eldrick
reflectively
was
a
big
newspaper
reader
he
used
to
go
to
the
free
library
a
great
deal
i
begin
to
think
he
must
certainly
be
dead
or
locked
up
however
in
supplement
of
your
endeavours
i
did
a
little
work
of
my
own
last
night
there
you
are
he
went
on
picking
up
the
local
papers
and
handing
them
over
i
put
that
in
we
see
if
any
response
comes
but
now
a
word
byner
since
you
come
to
me
you
have
heard
me
mention
my
late
clerk
pratt
yes
answered
byner
pratt
has
left
us
and
is
in
business
as
a
sort
of
estate
agent
in
the
next
street
continued
eldrick
now
i
have
particular
reasons
most
particular
reasons
why
pratt
should
remain
in
absolute
ignorance
of
your
presence
in
the
town
if
you
should
happen
to
come
across
him
as
you
may
for
though
there
are
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
us
here
it
a
small
place
compared
with
london
do
let
him
know
your
business
i
not
very
likely
to
do
that
eldrick
remarked
byner
quietly
aye
but
you
do
take
my
meaning
said
eldrick
eagerly
i
mean
this
it
just
possible
that
pratt
may
see
that
advertisement
of
yours
and
that
he
may
write
to
your
firm
in
that
case
as
he
here
and
you
here
your
partner
would
send
his
letter
to
you
do
deal
with
it
here
do
if
you
should
come
across
pratt
even
let
him
know
your
name
when
i
a
job
of
this
sort
replied
byner
i
do
let
anybody
know
my
name
except
people
like
you
when
i
register
at
one
of
your
hotels
presently
i
shall
be
black
of
london
but
if
this
pratt
wanted
to
give
any
information
about
parrawhite
he
give
it
to
you
surely
now
that
you
advertised
no
he
would
asserted
eldrick
why
because
he
told
me
all
he
knows
or
says
he
knows
already
the
inquiry
agent
looked
keenly
at
the
solicitor
for
a
moment
during
which
they
both
kept
silence
then
byner
smiled
you
said
says
he
knows
he
remarked
do
you
think
he
tell
the
truth
about
parrawhite
i
should
say
now
it
quite
likely
he
did
answered
eldrick
the
truth
is
i
making
some
inquiry
myself
about
pratt
and
i
do
want
this
to
interfere
with
it
you
keep
me
informed
of
what
you
find
out
and
i
help
you
all
i
can
while
you
here
it
may
be
a
clerk
came
into
the
room
and
looked
at
his
master
george
pickard
of
the
at
whitcliffe
sir
he
said
well
asked
eldrick
wants
to
see
you
about
that
advertisement
in
the
paper
this
morning
sir
continued
the
clerk
eldrick
looked
at
byner
and
smiled
significantly
then
he
turned
towards
the
door
bring
pickard
in
he
said
chapter
xviii
the
confiding
landlord
the
clerk
presently
ushered
in
a
short
man
apparently
of
thirty
to
years
of
age
whose
chief
personal
characteristics
lay
in
a
pair
of
the
smallest
eyes
ever
set
in
a
human
countenance
and
a
mere
apology
for
a
nose
but
both
nose
and
eyes
combined
somehow
to
communicate
an
idea
of
profound
inquiry
as
the
round
face
in
which
they
were
placed
turned
from
the
solicitor
to
the
man
from
london
and
a
podgy
forefinger
was
lifted
to
a
red
forehead
servant
gentlemen
said
the
visitor
fine
morning
for
the
time
of
year
take
a
chair
pickard
replied
eldrick
let
me
see
from
the
at
whitcliffe
i
believe
landlord
sir
had
that
house
a
many
years
answered
pickard
as
he
took
a
seat
near
the
wall
seven
year
come
next
michaelmas
any
road
just
so
and
you
want
to
see
me
about
the
advertisement
in
this
morning
paper
continued
eldrick
what
about
it
now
the
landlord
looked
at
eldrick
and
then
at
eldrick
companion
the
solicitor
understood
that
look
it
meant
that
what
his
caller
had
to
say
was
of
a
private
nature
it
all
right
pickard
he
remarked
reassuringly
this
gentleman
is
here
on
just
the
same
business
whatever
you
say
will
be
treated
as
confidential
it
go
no
further
you
something
to
tell
about
my
late
clerk
james
parrawhite
pickard
who
had
been
nervously
fingering
a
white
billycock
hat
now
put
it
down
on
the
floor
and
thrust
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
as
if
to
keep
them
safe
while
he
talked
it
like
this
here
he
answered
when
i
saw
that
there
advertisement
in
the
paper
this
mornin
says
i
to
my
missus
away
i
says

this
very
day

eldrick
there

summat
as
i
can
tell
about
yon
man

mention
james
parrawhite
i
said
nowt
about

to
nobody
up
to
now
it
were
private
business
atween
him
and
me
as
it
were
but
i
lost
money
over
it
and
of
course
ten
pound

pound
gentlemen
quite
so
agreed
eldrick
and
you
shall
have
your
ten
pounds
if
you
can
tell
anything
useful
i
do
know
owt
about
it
being
useful
sir
nor
what
use
is
to
be
made
on
it
said
pickard
but
i
can
tell
you
a
bit
o
truth
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
wi
what
i
tell
but
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
at
the
door
by
which
he
had
just
entered
another
name
have
to
be
browt
in
private
like
name
as
it
so
happens
o
one
o
your
clerks
t
head
clerk
i
given
to
understand
mr
pratt
eldrick
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
but
he
continued
to
look
significantly
at
byner
as
he
turned
to
the
landlord
pratt
has
left
me
he
said
left
me
three
weeks
ago
so
you
need
be
afraid
pickard
say
anything
you
like
oh
i
did
know
remarked
pickard
it
not
oft
that
i
come
down
in
t
town
and
we
do
hear
much
barford
news
up
our
way
well
it
this
here
eldrick
you
know
where
my
place
is
of
course
eldrick
nodded
and
turned
to
byner
i
better
explain
to
you
he
said
whitcliffe
is
an
outlying
part
of
the
town
well
up
the
hills
a
sort
of

of
which
our
friend
here

tavern
by
the
roadside
where

rather
fond
of

of

up
there
to

an
hour
or
two
enjoyin
hisself
well
now
as

doubt
well
aweer
eldrick
he
were
a
reight
hand
at
talkin
were
yon
parrawhite
he
t
gift
o
t
gab
reight
enough
and
talked
well
an
all
and
of
course
him
an
me
we
hed
bits
o
conversation
at
times
he
come
to
t
house
and
sometimes
o
an
all
an
he
tell
me
he
had
a
deal
o
experience
i
racin
matters
whether
it
were
true
or
not
i
say
but
true
enough
said
eldrick
he
had
well
so
he
said
continued
pickard
and
he
was
allus
tellin
me
he
could
make
a
pile
o
brass
on
t
turf
if
he
only
had
capital
an
t
end
he
persuaded
me
to
start
what
he
called
investin
money
with
him
i
that
way
i
plain
language
it
meant
givin
him
brass
to
put
on
horses
he
said
was
goin
to
win
d
understand
perfectly
replied
eldrick
you
gave
him
various
amounts
which
he
was
to
stake
for
you
just
so
sir
and
at
first
said
pickard
with
a
shake
of
the
head
at
first
i
no
great
reason
to
grumble
he
wor
a
good
hand
at
spottin
a
winner
but
as
time
went
on
i
t
greatest
difficulty
in
gettin
a
settlement
wi
him
d
see
he
wor
just
as
good
a
hand
at
makin
excuses
as
he
wor
at
pickin
out
winners
better
i
think
i
nivver
knew
wheer
i
was
wi
him
he
pay
up
and
then
he
persuade
me
to
go
in
for
another
do
wi
t
brass
i
won
and
happen
we
should
lose
that
time
and
then
of
course
we
had
to
hev
another
investment
to
get
back
what
we
dropped
and
so
it
went
on
but
t
end
wor
this
here

when

what
do
you
think

mr
pickard
asked
byner
gow
i
know
what
i
think
replied
pickard
disgustedly
i
think
if
he
did
get
any
brass
out
o
pratt
which
is
what
i
know
nowt
about
and
hew
much
belief
in
he
went
straight
away
fro
t
town
vanished
i
do
know
this
he
nivver
went
back
to
his
lodgin
that
neet
i
went
theer
mysen
next
day
to
inquire
eldrick
pricked
up
his
ears
at
that
he
remembered
that
he
had
sent
pratt
to
make
inquiry
at
parrawhite
lodgings
on
the
morning
whereon
the
money
was
missing
what
time
of
the
day
on
the
was
that
mr
pickard
he
asked
evenin
sir
replied
the
landlord
they
nivver
seen
naught
of
him
since
he
went
out
the
day
before
oh
he
did
me
did
parrawhite
of
course
i
lost
mi
brass
fifty
odd
pounds
byner
gave
eldrick
a
glance
i
think
pickard
has
earned
the
ten
pounds
you
offered
he
said
eldrick
took
the
hint
and
pulled
out
his
of
course
you
to
keep
all
this
private
strictly
private
pickard
he
said
as
he
wrote
not
a
word
to
a
soul
just
as
you
order
sir
agreed
pickard
i
say
nowt
to
nobody
and
perhaps
tomorrow
perhaps
this
afternoon
you
see
me
at
the
remarked
byner
i
shall
just
drop
in
you
know
you
need
know
me
if
there
anybody
about
all
right
sir
i
understand
said
pickard
quiet
the
word
what
very
good
much
obliged
to
you
gentlemen
when
the
landlord
had
gone
eldrick
motioned
byner
to
pick
up
his
hat
come
across
the
street
with
me
he
said
i
want
us
to
have
a
consultation
with
a
friend
of
mine
a
barrister
collingwood
for
this
matter
is
assuming
a
very
queer
aspect
and
we
ca
move
too
warily
nor
consider
all
the
features
too
thoroughly
collingwood
listened
with
deep
interest
to
eldrick
account
of
the
morning
events
and
once
again
he
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
all
these
various
happenings
in
connection
with
pratt
and
now
with
parrawhite
took
place
at
the
time
of
antony
bartle
death
and
he
said
so
true
enough
agreed
eldrick
and
once
more
pointed
out
collingwood
we
hearing
of
a
hold
pratt
claims
to
have
a
hold
on
mallathorpe
now
it
turns
out
that
parrawhite
boasted
of
a
hold
on
pratt
suppose
all
these
things
have
a
common
origin
suppose
the
hold
which
parrawhite
had
or
has
on
pratt
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
hold
which
pratt
has
on
mallathorpe
in
that
case
or
cases
what
is
the
best
thing
to
do
will
you
gentlemen
allow
me
to
suggest
something
said
byner
very
well
find
parrawhite
of
all
the
people
concerned
in
this
parrawhite
from
your
account
of
him
anyway
eldrick
is
the
likeliest
person
to
extract
the
truth
from
there
a
great
deal
in
that
suggestion
said
eldrick
do
you
know
what
i
think
he
went
on
turning
to
collingwood
byner
tells
me
he
means
to
stay
here
until
he
has
come
across
some
satisfactory
news
of
parrawhite
or
solved
the
mystery
of
his
disappearance
well
now
that
we
found
that
there
is
some
ground
for
believing
that
parrawhite
was
in
some
fashion
mixed
up
with
pratt
about
that
time
why
not
place
the
whole
thing
in
byner
hands
let
him
in
any
case
see
what
he
can
do
about
the
business
of
november
eh
i
take
it
answered
collingwood
looking
at
the
inquiry
agent
that
byner
having
heard
what
he
has
would
do
that
quite
apart
from
us
yes
said
byner
now
that
i
heard
what
pickard
had
to
say
i
certainly
shall
follow
that
up
i
am
following
out
something
of
my
own
said
collingwood
turning
to
eldrick
i
shall
know
more
by
this
time
tomorrow
let
us
have
a
conference
here
at
noon
they
separated
on
that
understanding
and
byner
went
his
own
ways
his
first
proceeding
was
to
visit
one
after
another
the
barford
newspaper
offices
and
to
order
the
insertion
in
large
type
and
immediately
of
the
advertisement
for
news
of
parrawhite
his
second
was
to
seek
the
general
post
office
where
he
wrote
out
and
dispatched
a
message
to
his
partner
in
london
that
message
was
in
cypher
translated
into
english
it
read
as
follows
if
person
named
pratt
sends
any
communication
to
us
parrawhite
on
no
account
let
him
know
i
am
in
barford
but
forward
whatever
he
sends
to
me
at
once
addressed
to
black
central
station
hotel
chapter
xix
the
when
collingwood
said
that
he
was
following
out
something
of
his
own
he
was
thinking
of
an
interesting
discovery
which
he
had
made
it
was
one
which
might
have
no
significance
in
relation
to
the
present
perplexities
on
the
other
hand
out
of
it
might
come
a
good
deal
of
illumination
briefly
it
was
that
on
the
evening
before
this
consultation
with
eldrick
byner
he
had
found
out
that
he
was
living
in
the
house
of
a
man
who
had
actually
witnessed
the
famous
catastrophe
at
mallathorpe
mill
whereby
john
mallathorpe
his
manager
and
his
cashier
together
with
some
other
bystanders
had
lost
their
lives
on
settling
down
in
barford
collingwood
had
spent
a
couple
of
weeks
in
looking
about
him
for
comfortable
rooms
of
a
sort
that
appealed
to
his
love
of
quiet
and
retirement
he
had
found
them
at
last
in
an
old
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
a
fine
old
stone
house
once
a
farmstead
set
in
a
large
garden
and
tenanted
by
a
couple
who
having
far
more
room
than
they
needed
for
themselves
had
no
objection
to
letting
part
of
it
to
a
business
gentleman
collingwood
fell
in
love
with
this
place
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
the
rooms
were
large
and
full
of
delightful
nooks
and
corners
the
garden
was
rich
in
old
trees
from
it
there
were
fine
views
of
the
valley
beneath
and
the
hills
in
the
distance
within
two
miles
of
the
town
and
easily
approached
by
a
convenient
it
was
yet
quite
out
in
the
country
he
was
just
as
much
set
up
by
his
landlady
a
comfortable
woman
who
fostered
true
yorkshire
notions
about
breakfast
and
knew
how
to
cook
a
good
dinner
at
night
with
her
collingwood
had
soon
come
to
terms
and
to
his
new
abode
had
transferred
a
quantity
of
books
and
pictures
from
london
he
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
domestic
menage
there
was
the
landlady
herself
cobcroft
who
having
no
children
of
her
own
had
adopted
a
niece
now
grown
up
and
a
teacher
in
an
adjacent
elementary
school
there
was
a
strapping
whose
dialect
was
too
broad
for
the
lodger
to
understand
more
than
a
few
words
of
it
finally
there
was
cobcroft
a
quiet
man
who
disappeared
early
in
the
morning
and
was
sometimes
seen
by
collingwood
returning
home
in
the
evening
lately
with
the
advancing
spring
this
unobtrusive
individual
was
seen
about
the
garden
at
the
end
of
the
day
collingwood
had
so
seen
him
on
the
evening
before
the
talk
with
eldrick
and
byner
busied
in
setting
seeds
in
the
and
he
had
asked
cobcroft
just
then
in
his
if
her
husband
was
fond
of
gardening
it
a
nice
change
for
him
sir
answered
the
landlady
he
kept
pretty
close
at
it
all
day
in
the
office
yonder
at
mallathorpe
mill
and
it
does
him
good
to
get
a
bit
o
fresh
air
at
nights
now
that
the
fine
weather
coming
on
that
was
one
reason
why
we
took
this
old
place
it
a
deal
better
air
here
nor
what
it
is
in
the
town
so
your
husband
is
at
mallathorpe
mill
eh
asked
collingwood
been
there
in
the
boy
and
man
over
thirty
years
sir
replied
cobcroft
did
he
see
that
terrible
affair
then
was
it
two
years
ago
the
landlady
shook
her
head
and
let
out
a
weighty
sigh
aye
i
should
think
he
did
she
answered
and
a
nice
shock
it
gave
him
too
he
actually
saw
that
chimney
fall
him
and
another
clerk
were
looking
out
o
the
window
when
it
gave
way
collingwood
said
no
more
then
except
to
remark
that
such
a
sight
must
indeed
have
been
trying
to
the
nerves
but
for
purposes
of
his
own
he
determined
to
have
a
talk
with
cobcroft
and
the
next
evening
seeing
him
in
his
garden
again
he
went
out
to
him
and
got
into
conversation
and
eventually
led
up
to
the
subject
of
mallathorpe
mill
the
new
chimney
of
which
could
be
seen
from
a
corner
of
the
garden
your
wife
tells
me
observed
collingwood
that
you
were
present
when
the
old
chimney
fell
at
the
mill
yonder
cobcroft
a
quiet
unassuming
man
usually
of
few
words
looked
along
the
hillside
at
the
new
chimney
and
nodded
his
head
a
curious
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
was
sir
he
said
and
i
hope
i
may
never
see
aught
o
that
sort
again
as
long
as
ever
i
live
it
was
one
o
those
things
a
man
can
never
forget
do
talk
about
it
if
you
do
want
to
remarked
collingwood
but
i
heard
so
much
about
that
affair
that
oh
i
do
mind
talking
about
it
replied
cobcroft
he
leaned
over
the
fence
of
his
garden
still
gazing
at
the
mill
in
the
distance
there
were
others
that
saw
it
of
course
lots
of
but
i
was
close
at
hand
our
office
was
filled
with
the
dust
in
a
few
seconds
it
was
a
sudden
affair
asked
collingwood
it
was
one
of
those
affairs
answered
cobcroft
slowly
that
some
folk
had
been
expecting
for
a
long
time
only
nobody
had
the
sense
to
see
that
it
might
happen
at
some
unexpected
minute
it
was
a
very
old
chimney
it
looked
all
right
stood
plumb
and
all
that
but
mallathorpe
my
old
master
john
mallathorpe
i
talking
of
he
got
an
idea
from
two
or
three
little
things
d
see
that
it
was
as
safe
as
it
ought
to
be
and
he
got
a
couple
of
these
professional
steeplejacks
to
examine
it
they
made
a
thorough
examination
too
so
far
as
one
could
tell
by
what
they
did
they
been
at
the
job
several
days
when
the
accident
happened
one
of
had
only
just
come
down
when
the
chimney
fell
mallathorpe
himself
and
his
manager
and
his
cashier
had
just
stepped
out
of
the
and
crossed
the
yard
to
hear
what
this
man
had
got
to
say
when
down
it
came
not
the
slightest
warning
at
the
time
it
just
collapsed
you
saw
the
actual
collapse
asked
collingwood
aye
did
i
exclaimed
cobcroft
another
man
and
myself
were
looking
out
of
the
office
window
right
opposite
it
fell
in
the
queerest
way
like
this
he
went
on
holding
up
his
supposing
this
shaft
was
the
chimney
standing
straight
up
as
we
looked
we
saw
it
suddenly
bulge
out
on
all
sides
it
was
a
square
chimney
same
size
all
the
way
up
till
you
got
to
the
cornice
at
the
top
bulge
out
d
see
just
about
up
simultaneous
like
then
down
it
came
with
a
roar
that
they
heard
over
half
the
town
course
there
were
some
two
or
three
thousands
of
tons
of
stuff
in
that
chimney
and
when
the
dust
was
cleared
a
bit
there
it
was
in
one
great
heap
right
across
the
yard
and
it
was
a
good
job
concluded
cobcroft
reflectively
that
it
fell
straight
collapsed
in
itself
as
you
might
say
for
if
it
had
fallen
slanting
either
way
it
ha
smashed
right
through
some
of
the
sheds
and
there
ha
been
a
terrible
loss
of
life
john
mallathorpe
was
killed
on
the
spot
i
believe
suggested
collingwood
aye
and
gaukrodger
and
marshall
and
the
steeplejack
that
had
just
come
down
and
another
or
two
said
cobcroft
they
no
chance
they
were
standing
in
a
group
at
the
very
foot
talking
they
were
all
killed
there
and
then
instantaneous
some
others
were
struck
and
injured
one
or
two
died
yes
sir
i
not
very
like
to
forget
that
a
terrible
experience
agreed
collingwood
it
would
naturally
fix
itself
on
your
memory
aye
my
memory
very
keen
about
it
said
cobcroft
i
remember
every
detail
of
that
morning
and
he
continued
showing
a
desire
to
become
reminiscent
there
was
something
happened
that
morning
before
the
accident
that
i
oft
thought
over
and
has
oft
puzzled
me
i
never
said
aught
to
anybody
about
it
because
we
yorkshiremen
we
not
given
to
talking
about
affairs
that
do
concern
us
and
after
all
it
was
none
o
mine
but
you
a
law
gentleman
and
i
dare
say
you
get
things
told
to
you
in
confidence
now
and
then
and
of
course
this
is
between
you
and
me
i
not
deny
that
i
have
oft
thought
that
i
would
like
to
tell
it
to
a
lawyer
of
some
sort
and
find
out
how
it
struck
him
anything
that
you
like
to
tell
me
cobcroft
i
shall
treat
as
a
matter
of
confidence
until
you
tell
me
it
no
longer
a
secret
answered
collingwood
why
continued
cobcroft
it
is
what
you
rightly
would
call
a
secret
though
i
do
think
anybody
knows
aught
about
it
but
myself
it
was
just
this
and
it
may
be
there
naught
in
it
but
a
mere
fancy
mine
that
morning
before
the
accident
happened
i
was
in
and
out
of
the
private
office
a
good
deal
carrying
in
and
out
letters
and
account
books
and
so
on
john
mallathorpe
private
office
understand
sir
opened
out
of
our
as
it
does
still
the
present
manager
horsfall
has
it
just
as
it
was
well
now
on
one
occasion
when
i
went
in
there
to
take
a
ledger
back
to
the
safe
mallathorpe
had
his
manager
and
cashier
gaukrodger
and
marshall
in
with
him
mallathorpe
he
always
used
a
desk
to
write
at
never
wrote
sitting
down
though
he
had
a
big
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room
that
he
used
to
sit
at
to
look
over
accounts
or
talk
to
people
now
when
i
went
in
he
and
gaukrodger
and
marshall
were
all
at
this
desk
in
the
and
they
were
signing
some
papers
at
least
gaukrodger
had
just
signed
a
paper
and
marshall
was
taking
the
pen
from
him
there
marshall
says
mallathorpe
and
then
he
went
on
we
sign
this
other
it
well
to
have
these
things
in
duplicate
in
case
one
gets
lost
and
then
well
then
i
went
out
and
why
that
was
all
you
some
idea
in
your
mind
about
that
said
collingwood
who
had
watched
cobcroft
closely
as
he
talked
what
is
it
cobcroft
smiled
and
looked
round
as
if
to
ascertain
that
they
were
alone
why
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
tell
you
what
i
did
wonder
some
time
afterwards
i
dare
say
you
aware
it
was
all
in
the
papers
that
john
mallathorpe
died
intestate
yes
asserted
collingwood
i
know
that
i
oft
wondered
continued
cobcroft
if
that
could
ha
been
his
will
that
they
were
signing
but
then
i
reflected
a
bit
on
matters
and
there
were
two
or
three
things
that
made
me
say
naught
at
all
not
a
word
first
of
all
i
considered
it
a
very
unlikely
thing
that
a
rich
man
like
john
mallathorpe
would
make
a
will
for
himself
second
i
remembered
that
very
soon
after
i
been
in
his
private
office
marshall
came
out
into
the
and
gave
the
office
lad
a
lot
of
letters
and
documents
to
take
to
the
post
some
of
big
envelopes
and
i
thought
that
what
i
seen
signed
was
some
agreement
or
other
that
was
in
one
of
them
and
third
and
most
important
no
will
was
ever
found
in
any
of
john
mallathorpe
drawers
or
safes
or
anywhere
though
they
turned
things
upside
down
at
the
office
and
i
heard
at
his
house
as
well
of
course
you
see
sir
supposing
that
to
have
been
a
will
why
the
only
two
men
who
could
possibly
have
proved
it
was
were
dead
and
gone
they
were
killed
with
him
and
of
course
the
young
people
the
nephew
and
niece
they
came
in
for
everything
so
there
was
an
end
of
it
but
i
oft
wondered
what
those
papers
were
one
thing
is
certain
anyway
concluded
cobcroft
with
a
grim
laugh
when
those
three
signed
they
were
picking
up
their
pens
for
the
last
time
how
long
was
it
after
you
saw
the
signing
of
those
papers
that
the
accident
occurred
asked
collingwood
it
be
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
replied
cobcroft
a
few
minutes
after
i
left
the
private
office
gaukrodger
came
out
of
it
alone
and
stood
at
the
door
leading
into
the
yard
looking
up
at
the
chimney
the
was
just
coming
down
and
his
mate
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
bottom
gaukrodger
turned
back
to
the
private
office
and
called
mallathorpe
out
all
three
of
mallathorpe
gaukrodger
marshall
went
out
and
walked
across
the
yard
to
the
chimney
foot
they
stood
there
talking
a
bit
and
then
down
it
came
collingwood
thought
matters
over
supposing
that
the
document
which
cobcroft
spoke
of
as
being
in
process
of
execution
before
him
were
indeed
duplicate
copies
of
a
will
what
could
have
been
done
with
them
in
the
few
minutes
which
elapsed
between
the
signing
and
the
catastrophe
to
the
chimney
it
was
scarcely
likely
that
john
mallathorpe
would
have
sent
them
away
by
post
if
they
had
been
deposited
in
his
own
pocket
they
would
have
been
found
when
his
clothing
was
removed
and
examined
if
they
were
in
the
private
office
when
the
three
men
left
it
you
sure
the
drawers
safe
and
so
on
in
mallathorpe
room
were
thoroughly
searched
after
his
death
he
asked
i
should
think
they
were
answered
cobcroft
laconically
i
helped
at
that
myself
there
was
as
much
as
an
old
invoice
that
was
not
well
fingered
and
turned
over
no
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
what
seen
signed
was
some
contract
or
something
sent
off
there
and
then
by
the
lad
to
post
collingwood
made
no
further
remark
and
asked
no
more
questions
but
he
thought
long
and
seriously
that
night
and
he
came
to
certain
conclusions
first
what
cobcroft
had
seen
signed
was
john
will
second
john
mallathorpe
had
made
it
himself
and
had
taken
the
unusual
course
of
making
a
duplicate
copy
third
john
mallathorpe
had
probably
slipped
the
copy
into
the
of
which
was
in
his
private
office
when
he
went
out
to
speak
to
the
fourth
that
copy
had
come
into
linford
pratt
hands
through
antony
bartle
and
now
arose
two
big
questions
what
were
the
terms
of
that
will
and
where
was
the
duplicate
copy
he
was
still
putting
these
to
himself
when
noon
of
the
next
day
came
and
brought
eldrick
and
byner
for
the
promised
serious
consultation
chapter
xx
the
byner
in
taking
his
firm
advertisement
for
parrawhite
to
the
three
barford
newspaper
offices
had
done
so
with
a
special
design
he
wanted
pratt
to
see
that
a
serious
wish
to
discover
parrawhite
was
alive
in
more
quarters
than
one
he
knew
that
pratt
was
almost
certain
to
see
eldrick
advertisement
in
his
own
name
now
he
wanted
pratt
to
see
another
advertisement
of
the
same
nature
in
another
name
already
he
had
some
suspicion
that
pratt
had
not
told
eldrick
the
truth
about
parrawhite
and
that
nothing
would
suit
him
so
well
as
that
parrawhite
should
never
be
heard
of
or
mentioned
again
now
he
wished
pratt
to
learn
that
parrawhite
was
much
wanted
and
was
likely
to
be
much
mentioned
wherefore
the
supplementary
advertisements
with
halstead
byner
name
attached
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
pratt
could
fail
to
see
those
advertisements
there
were
three
newspapers
in
barford
one
a
morning
journal
of
large
circulation
throughout
the
county
the
other
two
evening
journals
which
usually
appeared
in
three
or
four
editions
as
byner
stipulated
for
large
type
and
a
prominent
position
in
the
personal
column
of
each
it
was
scarcely
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
a
townsman
like
pratt
would
miss
seeing
the
advertisement
most
likely
he
would
see
it
in
all
three
newspapers
and
if
he
had
also
seen
eldrick
similar
advertisement
he
would
begin
to
think
and
then
why
then
mused
byner
ruminating
on
his
design
then
we
will
see
what
he
will
do
meanwhile
there
was
something
he
himself
wanted
to
do
and
on
the
morning
following
his
arrival
in
the
town
he
set
out
to
do
it
byner
had
been
much
struck
by
pickard
account
of
his
dealings
with
james
parrawhite
on
the
evening
which
appeared
to
be
the
very
last
wherein
parrawhite
was
ever
seen
he
had
watched
the
landlord
of
the
closely
as
he
told
his
story
and
had
set
him
down
for
an
honest
if
somewhat
sly
and
lumpish
soul
who
was
telling
a
plain
tale
to
the
best
of
his
ability
byner
believed
all
the
details
of
that
story
he
even
believed
that
when
parrawhite
told
pickard
that
he
would
find
him
fifty
pounds
that
evening
or
early
next
day
he
meant
to
keep
his
word
in
the
circumstances
as
far
as
byner
could
reckon
them
up
from
what
he
had
gathered
it
would
not
have
paid
parrawhite
to
do
otherwise
byner
put
the
situation
to
himself
in
this
fashion
pratt
had
got
hold
of
some
secret
which
was
being
or
could
be
made
to
be
highly
profitable
to
him
parrawhite
had
discovered
this
and
was
in
a
position
to
blackmail
pratt
therefore
parrawhite
would
not
wish
to
leave
neighbourhood
so
long
as
there
was
money
to
be
got
out
of
pratt
parrawhite
would
stick
to
him
like
a
leech
but
if
parrawhite
was
to
abide
peaceably
in
barford
he
must
pay
pickard
that
little
matter
of
between
fifty
and
sixty
pounds
accordingly
in
byner
opinion
parrawhite
had
every
honest
intention
of
returning
to
the
on
the
evening
of
the
of
november
after
having
seen
pratt
and
in
byner
further
and
very
seriously
considered
opinion
the
whole
problem
for
solution
possibly
involving
the
solution
of
other
and
more
important
problems
was
this
did
parrawhite
meet
pratt
that
night
and
if
he
did
what
took
place
between
them
which
prevented
parrawhite
from
returning
to
pickard
it
was
in
an
endeavour
to
get
at
some
first
stage
of
a
solution
of
this
problem
that
byner
having
breakfasted
at
the
on
his
second
day
in
the
town
went
out
immediately
afterwards
asked
his
way
to
whitcliffe
and
was
directed
to
an
electric
tram
which
started
from
the
town
hall
square
and
after
running
through
a
district
of
tall
warehouses
and
squat
began
a
long
and
steady
climb
to
the
heights
along
the
town
when
he
left
it
he
found
himself
in
a
district
eminently
characteristic
of
that
part
of
the
country
the
tram
set
him
down
at
a
on
a
high
ridge
of
land
beneath
him
lay
barford
its
towers
and
spires
and
the
gables
of
its
tall
buildings
showing
amongst
the
smoke
of
its
many
chimneys
all
about
him
lay
open
ground
broken
by
the
numerous
stone
quarries
of
which
eldrick
had
spoken
and
at
a
little
distance
along
one
of
the
four
roads
at
the
intersection
of
which
he
stood
he
saw
a
few
houses
and
cottages
one
of
which
taller
and
bigger
than
the
rest
was
distinguished
by
a
pole
planted
in
front
of
its
stone
porch
and
bearing
a
swinging
sign
whereon
was
rudely
painted
the
figure
of
a
man
in
lincoln
green
byner
walked
on
to
this
entered
a
flagged
hall
and
found
himself
confronting
pickard
who
at
sight
of
him
motioned
him
into
a
little
parlour
behind
the
bar
mornin
mister
said
he
you
be
all
right
in
here
there
nobody
about
just
now
and
if
my
missis
or
any
o

want
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
where

told
us

to

byner

perhaps

to
this
evidence
of
friendliness
and
pickard
after
disappearing
into
a
dark
archway
and
down
some
deeply
worn
stone
steps
came
back
with
a
foaming
jug
the
sight
of
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
delight
he
gazed
admiringly
at
the
liquor
which
he
presently
poured
into
two
tumblers
and
drew
his
visitor
attention
to
its
colour

it
a
job
walk
forrard
a
piece
byner
strolled
along
the
road
a
little
way
and
leaned
over
a
wall
until
pickard
wearing
his
white
billycock
hat
and
accompanied
by
a
fine
lounged
up
with
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
together
they
went
a
little
further
along
now
then
said
the
landlord
crossing
the
road
towards
the
entrance
of
a
narrow
lane
which
ran
between
two
high
stone
walls
this
here
is
stubbs
lane
so
called
i
believe
an
owd
gentleman
named
similar
used
to
hev
a
house
here
been
pulled
down
ye
see
it
runs
up
fro
this
towards
yon
terrace
o
houses
folks
hereabouts
calls
that
terrace
t
world
end
they
t
last
houses
afore
ye
get
on
to
t
open
moorlands
now
that
night
parrawhite
wor
aimin
to
meet
pratt
it
wor
i
this
very
lane
pratt
when
he
left
t
other
side
o
my
place
come
up
t
road
and
up
this
lane
and
it
wor
at
t
top
o
t
lane
bill
thomson
see
pratt
and
parrawhite
cross
into
what
bill
called
t
owd
quarry
ground
can
we
go
into
that
asked
byner
nowt
easier
said
pickard
it
a
sort
of
open
space
where
t
childer
goes
and
plays
about
they
worked
no
stone
theer
for
many
a
long
year
all
t
stone
exhausted
like
he
led
byner
along
the
lane
to
its
further
end
pointed
out
the
place
where
thomson
said
he
had
seen
pratt
and
parrawhite
and
indicated
the
terrace
of
houses
in
which
pratt
lived
then
he
crossed
towards
the
old
quarries
do
know
what
they
should
want
to
come
in
here
for
unless
it
wor
to
talk
very
confidential
said
pickard
but
lor
bless
yer
it
be
quiet
enough
anywheer
about
this
neighbourhood
at
that
time
o
neet
however
this
is
wheer
bill
thomson
says
he
see
come
he
led
the
way
amongst
the
disused
quarries
and
byner
following
climbed
on
a
mound
now
grown
over
with
grass
and
weed
and
looked
about
him
to
his
town
eyes
the
place
was
something
novel
he
had
never
seen
the
like
of
it
before
gradually
he
began
to
understand
it
the
stone
had
been
torn
out
of
the
earth
sometimes
in
square
pits
sometimes
in
ones
until
the
various
veins
and
strata
had
become
exhausted
then
when
men
went
away
nature
had
stepped
in
to
assert
her
rights
all
over
the
despoiled
region
she
had
spread
a
new
clothing
of
green
turf
had
grown
on
the
flooring
of
the
quarries
ivy
and
bramble
had
covered
the
deep
scars
bushes
had
sprung
up
trees
were
already
springing
and
in
one
of
the
excavations
some
man
had
planted
a
in
orderly
and
formal
rows
and
plots
dangerous
place
that
there
said
pickard
suddenly
if
i
known
that
i
should
ha
let
my
young
come
to
play
about
here
they
might
be
tummlin
in
and
drownin
theirsens
i
mun
tell
my
missis
to
keep
away
byner
turned
to
find
the
landlord
pointing
at
the
old
shaft
which
had
gradually
become
filled
with
water
in
the
morning
sunlight
its
surface
glittered
like
a
plane
of
burnished
metal
but
when
the
two
men
went
nearer
and
gazed
at
it
from
its
edge
the
water
was
black
and
unfathomable
to
the
eye
goodish
thirty
feet
o
water
in
that
there
surmised
pickard
none
safe
for
childer
to
play
about
theer
nowt
to
protect
next
time
i
see
mestur
shepherd
i
shall
mak
it
my
business
to
tell
him
so
he
owt
either
to
drain
that
watter
off
or
put
a
fence
around
it
is
shepherd
the
asked
byner
aye
it
all
his
this
land
answered
pickard
he
pointed
to
a
house
set
amidst
elms
and
chestnuts
some
distance
off
across
the
moor
lives
theer
does
mestur
shepherd
varry
man
he
is
how
could
that
water
be
drained
off
asked
byner
with
assumed
carelessness
easy
enough
replied
pickard
cut
through
yon
ledge
and
let
it
run
into
t
far
quarry
there
a
couple
o
men
do
that
job
in
a
day
byner
made
no
further
remark
he
and
pickard
strolled
back
to
the
together
and
declining
the
landlord
invitation
to
step
inside
and
take
another
glass
but
promising
to
see
him
again
very
soon
the
inquiry
agent
walked
on
to
the
and
rode
down
to
barford
to
keep
his
appointment
with
eldrick
and
collingwood
at
the
chambers
chapter
xxi
the
direct
charge
while
byner
was
pursuing
his
investigations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
collingwood
was
out
at
normandale
grange
discussing
certain
matters
with
nesta
mallathorpe
he
had
not
only
thought
long
and
deeply
over
his
conversation
with
cobcroft
the
previous
evening
but
had
begun
to
think
about
the
crucial
point
of
the
clerk
story
as
soon
as
he
spoke
in
the
morning
and
the
result
of
his
meditations
was
that
he
rose
early
intercepted
cobcroft
before
he
started
for
mill
and
asked
his
permission
to
the
story
to
miss
mallathorpe
cobcroft
raised
no
objection
and
when
collingwood
had
been
to
his
chambers
and
seen
his
letters
he
chartered
a
car
and
rode
out
to
normandale
where
he
told
nesta
of
what
he
had
learned
and
of
his
own
conclusions
and
nesta
having
listened
carefully
to
all
he
had
to
tell
put
a
direct
question
to
him
you
think
this
document
which
pratt
told
me
he
holds
is
my
late
will
she
said
what
do
you
suppose
its
terms
to
be
frankly
these
or
something
like
these
replied
collingwood
and
i
get
at
my
conclusions
in
this
way
your
uncle
died
intestate
consequently
everything
in
the
shape
of
real
estate
came
to
your
brother
and
everything
in
personal
property
to
your
brother
and
yourself
now
supposing
that
the
document
which
pratt
boasts
of
holding
is
the
will
one
fact
is
very
certain
the
property
real
or
personal
is
not
disposed
of
in
the
way
in
which
it
became
disposed
of
because
of
john
mallathorpe
intestacy
he
probably
disposed
of
it
in
quite
another
fashion
why
do
i
think
that
because
the
probability
is
that
pratt
said
to
your
mother
have
got
john
mallathorpe
will
it
does
leave
his
property
to
your
son
and
daughter
therefore
i
have
all
of
you
at
my
mercy
make
it
worth
my
while
or
i
will
bring
the
will
forward
do
you
see
that
situation
then
replied
nesta
after
a
moment
reflection
you
do
think
that
my
mother
was
very
anxious
to
get
that
document
a
will
from
pratt
collingwood
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
her
mind
was
still
uneasy
about
pratt
account
of
the
affair
of
the
but
the
matter
had
to
be
faced
i
think
your
mother
would
naturally
be
very
anxious
to
secure
such
a
document
he
said
you
must
remember
that
according
to
pratt
story
to
you
she
tried
to
buy
it
from
him
just
as
you
did
yourself
though
you
of
course
had
no
idea
of
what
it
was
you
wanted
to
buy
what
i
wanted
to
buy
she
answered
readily
was
necessity
from
further
interference
but
is
there
no
way
of
compelling
pratt
to
give
up
that
document
whatever
it
is
ca
he
be
made
to
give
it
up
a
way
is
may
be
being
made
just
now
through
another
affair
replied
collingwood
at
present
matters
are
vague
one
could
go
to
pratt
and
demand
something
at
which
one
is
after
all
only
guessing
your
mother
of
course
would
deny
that
she
knows
what
it
is
that
pratt
holds
but
there
is
the
possibility
of
the
duplicate
to
which
cobcroft
referred
now
i
want
to
put
the
question
straight
to
you
supposing
that
duplicate
will
can
be
found
and
supposing
to
put
it
plainly
terms
dispossess
you
of
all
your
considerable
property
what
then
do
you
want
the
exact
truth
she
asked
well
then
i
should
just
welcome
anything
that
cleared
up
all
this
mystery
what
is
it
at
present
this
situation
but
intolerable
i
know
that
my
mother
is
in
pratt
power
and
likely
to
remain
so
as
long
as
ever
this
goes
on
probably
for
life
she
will
not
give
me
her
confidence
what
is
more
i
am
certain
that
she
is
giving
it
to
esther
mawson
who
is
most
likely
with
pratt
esther
mawson
is
always
with
her
i
am
almost
sure
that
she
communicates
with
pratt
through
esther
mawson
it
is
all
what
i
say
intolerable
i
had
rather
lose
every
penny
that
has
come
into
my
hands
than
have
this
go
on
answer
me
a
plain
question
said
collingwood
is
your
mother
fond
of
money
position
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
is
fond
of
power
replied
nesta
it
pleased
her
greatly
when
we
came
into
all
this
wealth
to
know
that
she
was
the
virtual
administrator
even
if
she
could
only
do
it
by
collusion
with
pratt
she
would
make
a
fight
for
all
that
she
and
i
hold
it
useless
to
deny
that
do
forget
she
added
looking
appealingly
at
collingwood
do
forget
that
she
has
known
what
it
was
to
be
poor
and
if
one
does
come
into
money
i
suppose
one
does
want
to
lose
it
again
oh
it
natural
enough
agreed
collingwood
but
if
things
are
as
i
think
pratt
would
be
an
incubus
a
for
ever
anyway
i
came
out
to
tell
you
what
i
learned
and
what
i
have
an
idea
may
be
the
truth
and
above
all
to
get
your
definite
opinion
you
want
the
pratt
influence
out
of
the
way
at
any
cost
at
any
cost
she
affirmed
even
if
i
have
to
go
back
to
earning
my
own
living
whatever
pleasure
in
life
could
there
be
for
me
knowing
that
at
the
back
of
all
this
there
is
that
what
pratt
answered
collingwood
pratt
he
the
shadow
with
his
deep
schemes
however
as
i
said
there
may
be
developing
at
this
moment
another
way
of
getting
at
pratt
gentlemen
like
pratt
born
schemers
invariably
forget
one
very
important
factor
in
life
the
unexpected
even
the
cleverest
and
most
subtle
schemer
may
have
his
delicate
machinery
broken
to
pieces
by
a
chance
bit
of
mere
dust
getting
into
it
at
an
unexpected
turn
of
the
wheels
and
to
turn
to
plainer
language
i
going
back
to
barford
now
to
hear
what
another
man
has
to
say
concerning
certain
of
pratt
recent
movements
eldrick
was
already
waiting
when
collingwood
reached
his
chambers
byner
came
there
a
few
moments
later
within
half
an
hour
the
barrister
had
told
his
story
of
cobcroft
and
the
inquiry
agent
his
of
his
visit
to
the
and
the
quarries
and
the
solicitor
listened
quietly
and
attentively
to
both
and
in
the
end
turned
to
collingwood
i
withdraw
my
opinion
about
the
nature
of
the
document
which
pratt
got
hold
of
he
said
what
he
got
is
what
you
think
john
mallathorpe
will
if
i
may
venture
an
opinion
remarked
byner
that
dead
certain
and
now
continued
eldrick
we
faced
with
a
nice
situation
either
of
you
forget
this
fact
not
out
of
willingness
on
her
part
but
because
she
got
to
do
it
mallathorpe
and
pratt
are
partners
in
that
affair
he
got
the
will
but
she
knows
its
contents
she
pay
any
price
to
pratt
to
keep
them
from
ever
becoming
known
or
operative
but
as
i
say
do
you
forget
something
what
asked
collingwood
eldrick
tapped
the
edge
of
the
table
emphasizing
his
words
as
he
spoke
them
they
can
destroy
that
will
whenever
they
like
he
said
and
once
destroyed
nothing
can
absolutely
prove
that
it
ever
existed
the
duplicate
suggested
collingwood
nothing
to
give
us
the
faintest
idea
as
to
its
existence
said
eldrick
we
might
advertise
said
collingwood
lots
of
advertising
was
done
when
john
mallathorpe
died
replied
the
solicitor
no
if
any
person
had
had
it
in
possession
it
would
have
turned
up
then
it
may
be
probably
is
possibly
must
be
somewhere
and
may
yet
come
to
light
but
there
another
way
of
getting
at
pratt
through
this
parrawhite
affair
pratt
most
likely
had
not
the
least
notion
that
he
would
ever
hear
of
parrawhite
again
he
is
going
to
hear
of
parrawhite
again
i
am
convinced
now
that
parrawhite
knew
something
about
this
and
that
pratt
squared
him
and
got
him
away
are
you
he
asked
turning
to
byner
but
byner
smiled
quietly
and
shook
his
head
no
he
answered
i
am
not
mr
eldrick
you
not
exclaimed
eldrick
surprised
and
wondering
that
anybody
could
fail
to
agree
with
him
why
not
then
because
replied
byner
i
am
certain
that
pratt
murdered
parrawhite
on
the
night
of
november
last
that
why
he
did
square
him
he
did
get
him
away
he
killed
him
the
effect
of
this
straightforward
pronouncement
of
opinion
on
the
two
men
who
heard
it
was
strikingly
different
collingwood
face
at
once
became
cold
and
inscrutable
his
lips
fixed
themselves
sternly
his
eyes
looked
hard
into
a
problematic
future
but
eldrick
flushed
as
if
a
direct
accusation
had
been
levelled
at
himself
and
he
turned
on
the
inquiry
agent
almost
impatiently
murder
he
exclaimed
oh
come
i
really
that
rather
a
stiff
order
i
dare
say
pratt
been
up
to
all
sorts
of
trickery
and
even
deviltry
but
murder
is
quite
another
thing
you
pretty
ready
to
accuse
him
byner
moved
his
head
in
collingwood
direction
and
eldrick
turned
and
looked
anxiously
at
collingwood
who
finding
the
eyes
of
both
men
on
him
opened
his
hitherto
lips
i
think
it
quite
likely
he
said
byner
laughed
softly
and
looked
at
the
solicitor
just
listen
to
me
a
minute
or
two
eldrick
he
said
i
sum
up
my
own
ideas
on
this
matter
got
from
the
various
details
that
have
been
supplied
to
me
since
i
came
to
barford
just
consider
my
points
one
by
one
let
take
them
separately
and
see
how
they
fit
in
bartle
is
seen
by
his
to
take
a
certain
paper
from
a
book
which
came
from
the
late
john
mallathorpe
office
at
mallathorpe
mill
he
puts
that
paper
in
his
pocket
immediately
afterwards
bartle
goes
to
your
office
nobody
is
there
but
pratt
as
far
as
pratt
knows
bartle
dies
suddenly
after
telling
pratt
that
the
paper
is
john
mallathorpe
will
pratt
steals
the
will
and
the
probability
is
that
parrawhite
unknown
to
pratt
was
in
that
office
and
saw
him
steal
it
why
is
that
probable
because
next
night
parrawhite
who
is
being
pressed
for
money
by
pickard
tells
pickard
that
he
can
get
it
out
of
pratt
over
whom
he
has
a
hold
what
hold
we
can
imagine
what
hold
anyway
parrawhite
leaves
pickard
to
meet
pratt
he
did
meet
pratt
in
stubbs
lane
he
was
seen
to
go
with
pratt
into
the
disused
quarry
and
there
in
my
opinion
pratt
killed
him
and
disposed
of
his
body
what
does
pratt
do
next
he
goes
to
your
office
first
thing
next
morning
and
removes
certain
moneys
which
you
say
you
carelessly
left
in
your
desk
the
night
before
and
tears
out
certain
cheque
forms
from
your
book
when
parrawhite
never
turns
up
that
morning
you
and
pratt
conclude
that
he
the
thief
and
that
he
run
away
if
you
want
some
proof
of
the
correctness
of
this
last
suggestion
you
find
it
in
the
fact
that
no
use
has
ever
been
made
of
those
blank
cheques
and
that
in
all
probability
the
stolen
have
never
reached
the
bank
of
england
on
that
last
point
i
making
inquiry
but
my
feeling
is
that
pratt
destroyed
both
cheques
and
when
he
stole
them
this
man
parrawhite
out
of
the
way
pratt
has
a
clear
field
got
the
will
he
already
acquainted
mallathorpe
with
that
fact
and
with
the
terms
of
the
will
whatever
they
may
be
we
may
be
sure
however
that
they
are
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
her
willing
to
agree
to
his
demands
upon
her
and
accidentally
to
go
to
any
lengths
upon
which
we
need
touch
at
present
towards
getting
possession
of
the
will
from
him
and
the
present
situation
from
pratt
standpoint
of
yesterday
is
this
he
so
sure
of
his
own
safety
that
he
does
mind
revealing
to
the
daughter
that
the
mother
in
his
power
why
because
pratt
like
most
men
of
his
sort
can
not
believe
that
is
paramount
with
everybody
it
beyond
him
to
conceive
it
possible
that
miss
mallathorpe
would
do
anything
that
might
lose
her
several
thousands
a
year
he
argued
long
as
i
hold
that
will
nobody
and
nothing
can
make
me
give
it
up
nor
divulge
its
contents
but
i
can
bind
one
person
who
benefits
by
it
miss
mallathorpe
and
for
the
mother
sake
i
can
keep
the
daughter
quiet
well
he
has
kept
the
daughter
quiet
she
spoke
and
last
in
all
such
schemes
as
pratt
the
schemer
invariably
forgets
something
pratt
forgot
that
there
might
arise
what
actually
has
arisen
inquiry
for
parrawhite
the
search
for
parrawhite
is
afoot
and
if
you
want
to
get
at
pratt
it
will
have
to
be
through
what
i
firmly
believe
to
be
a
fact
his
murder
of
parrawhite
and
his
disposal
of
parrawhite
body
that
all
eldrick
concluded
byner
who
had
spoken
with
much
emphasis
throughout
it
all
seems
very
clear
to
me
and
he
added
with
a
glance
at
collingwood
i
think
collingwood
is
inclined
to
agree
with
most
of
what
i
said
pretty
nearly
all
if
not
all
assented
collingwood
i
think
put
into
clear
language
precisely
what
i
feel
i
do
believe
there
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
pratt
killed
parrawhite
and
we
can
and
must
get
at
him
in
that
way
what
do
you
suggest
he
continued
turning
to
byner
you
have
some
idea
of
course
first
of
all
answered
byner
we
must
arouse
any
suspicion
on
pratt
part
let
us
work
behind
the
screen
but
i
have
an
idea
as
to
how
he
disposed
of
parrawhite
and
i
going
to
follow
it
up
this
very
day
my
first
duty
you
know
is
towards
the
people
who
want
parrawhite
or
proof
of
his
death
i
propose
to
just
then
collingwood
clerk
came
in
with
a
telegram
sent
on
from
the
sir
he
answered
they
said
black
would
be
found
here
that
mine
said
the
inquiry
agent
i
left
word
at
the
hotel
that
they
were
to
send
to
your
chambers
if
any
wire
came
for
me
allow
me
he
opened
the
telegram
looked
it
over
and
waiting
until
the
clerk
had
gone
turned
to
his
companions
here
a
message
from
my
partner
halstead
he
continued
listen
to
what
he
wires
just
received
from
murgatroyd
shipping
agent
peel
row
barford
he
says
parrawhite
left
that
town
for
america
on
november
last
and
offers
further
information
let
me
know
what
to
reply
byner
laid
the
message
before
eldrick
and
collingwood
without
further
comment
chapter
xxii
the
on
the
evening
of
the
day
whereon
nesta
mallathorpe
had
paid
him
the
visit
which
had
resulted
in
so
much
plain
speech
on
both
sides
pratt
employed
his
leisure
in
a
calm
review
of
the
situation
he
was
by
no
means
dissatisfied
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
was
going
very
well
for
his
purposes
he
was
not
at
all
sorry
that
nesta
had
been
to
see
him
far
from
it
he
regretted
nothing
that
he
had
said
to
her
in
his
desperate
opinion
his
own
position
was
much
stronger
when
she
left
him
than
it
was
when
he
opened
his
office
door
to
her
she
now
knew
said
pratt
with
what
a
strong
and
resourceful
man
she
had
to
deal
she
would
respect
him
and
have
a
better
idea
of
him
now
that
she
was
aware
of
his
impregnable
position
herein
pratt
innate
vanity
and
his
ignorance
showed
themselves
he
had
little
knowledge
of
modern
young
women
and
few
ideas
about
them
and
such
ideas
as
he
possessed
were
usually
mistaken
ones
but
one
was
that
it
is
always
necessary
to
keep
a
firm
hand
on
women
let
them
see
and
feel
your
power
said
pratt
he
had
been
secretly
delighted
to
acquaint
nesta
mallathorpe
with
his
power
to
drive
it
into
her
that
he
had
the
whip
hand
of
her
mother
and
through
her
mother
of
nesta
herself
he
had
seen
that
nesta
was
much
upset
and
alarmed
by
what
he
told
her
and
though
she
certainly
seemed
to
recover
her
spirits
at
the
end
of
the
interview
and
even
refused
to
shake
hands
with
him
he
cherished
the
notion
that
in
the
war
of
words
he
had
come
off
a
decided
victor
he
did
not
believe
that
nesta
would
utter
to
any
other
soul
one
word
of
what
had
passed
between
them
she
would
be
too
much
afraid
of
calling
down
his
vengeance
on
her
mother
what
he
did
believe
was
that
as
time
went
by
and
all
progressed
smoothly
nesta
would
come
to
face
and
accept
facts
she
would
find
him
honest
and
hardworking
in
his
dealings
with
mallathorpe
as
he
fully
intended
to
be
from
purely
personal
and
selfish
motives
and
she
herself
would
begin
to
tolerate
and
then
to
trust
him
and
eventually
well
who
knew
what
might
or
might
not
happen
what
said
the
great
talleyrand
with
time
and
patience
the
mulberry
leaf
is
turned
into
satin
but
pratt
received
a
shock
next
morning
if
he
had
been
a
reader
of
london
newspapers
it
would
have
received
a
shock
the
day
before
pratt
however
was
essentially
parochial
in
his
newspaper
tastes
he
never
read
anything
but
the
barford
papers
and
when
he
picked
up
the
barford
morning
journal
and
saw
eldrick
advertisement
for
parrawhite
in
a
prominent
place
he
literally
started
from
sheer
surprise
not
unmingled
with
alarm
it
was
as
if
he
were
the
occupant
of
a
strong
position
only
fortified
who
suddenly
finds
a
shell
dropped
into
his
outworks
from
a
totally
unexpected
quarter
parrawhite
advertised
for
by
eldrick
why
for
what
reason
for
what
purpose
with
what
idea
parrawhite
of
all
men
in
the
world
parrawhite
of
whom
he
had
never
wanted
to
hear
again
and
what
on
earth
could
eldrick
want
with
him
or
with
news
of
him
it
would
be
or
might
be
an
uncommonly
awkward
thing
for
him
pratt
if
a
really
exhaustive
search
were
made
for
parrawhite
for
nobody
knew
better
than
himself
that
one
little
thing
leads
to
another
and
but
he
forbore
to
follow
out
what
might
have
been
his
train
of
thought
once
he
was
tempted
to
make
an
excuse
for
going
round
to
eldrick
pascoe
with
the
idea
of
fishing
for
information
but
he
refrained
let
things
develop
that
was
a
safer
plan
still
he
was
anxious
and
disturbed
all
day
then
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
he
bought
one
of
the
barford
evening
papers
and
saw
in
staring
letters
the
advertisement
which
byner
had
caused
to
be
inserted
only
a
few
hours
previously
and
at
that
pratt
became
afraid
parrawhite
wanted
news
of
parrawhite
wanted
and
in
two
separate
quarters
wanted
by
eldrick
wanted
by
some
london
people
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil
did
it
mean
at
any
rate
he
must
see
to
himself
one
thing
was
certain
no
search
for
parrawhite
must
be
permitted
in
barford
that
evening
instead
of
going
home
to
dinner
pratt
remained
in
town
and
dined
at
a
quiet
restaurant
when
he
dined
he
thought
and
planned
and
schemed
and
after
treating
himself
very
well
in
the
matter
of
food
and
drink
he
lighted
a
cigar
returned
to
his
new
offices
opened
a
safe
which
he
had
just
set
up
and
took
from
a
drawer
in
it
a
hundred
pounds
in
with
these
in
his
he
went
off
to
a
quiet
part
of
the
town
the
part
in
which
james
parrawhite
had
lodged
during
his
stay
in
barford
pratt
turned
into
a
somewhat
mean
and
shabby
street
a
street
of
small
shops
he
went
forward
amongst
them
until
he
came
to
one
which
if
anything
was
meaner
and
shabbier
than
the
others
and
bore
over
its
window
the
name
reuben
murgatroyd
watchmaker
and
jeweller
there
were
few
signs
of
jewellery
in
reuben
murgatroyd
window
some
cheap
clocks
some
watches
of
the
and
variety
a
selection
of
flashy
rings
and
chains
were
spread
on
the
shelves
equally
cheap
and
flashy
bangles
bracelets
and
brooches
lay
in
trays
on
the
sloping
bench
beneath
them
at
these
things
pratt
cast
no
more
than
a
contemptuous
glance
but
he
looked
with
interest
at
the
upper
part
of
the
window
in
which
were
displayed
numerous
handbills
and
small
posters
relating
to
shipping
chiefly
in
the
way
of
assisted
passages
to
various
parts
of
the
globe
these
set
out
that
you
could
get
an
assisted
passage
to
canada
for
so
much
to
australia
for
not
much
more
and
if
the
bills
and
posters
themselves
did
not
tell
you
all
you
wanted
to
know
certain
big
letters
at
the
foot
of
each
invited
you
to
apply
for
further
information
to
murgatroyd
agent
within
and
pratt
pushed
open
the
and
walked
inside
an
untidily
dressed
careworn
man
came
forward
from
a
parlour
at
the
rear
of
his
shop
at
sight
of
pratt
who
in
the
course
of
business
had
once
served
him
with
a
writ
his
pale
face
flushed
and
then
whitened
and
pratt
hastened
to
assure
him
of
his
peaceful
errand
all
right
murgatroyd
he
said
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
out
of
that
line
now
no
papers
of
that
sort
tonight
i
a
bit
of
business
i
can
put
in
your
hands
profitable
business
look
here
have
you
got
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
murgatroyd
who
looked
greatly
relieved
to
find
that
his
visitor
had
neither
writ
nor
summons
for
him
glanced
at
his
parlour
door
i
was
just
going
to
put
the
shutters
up
and
sit
down
to
a
bite
of
supper
pratt
he
answered
will
you
come
in
sir
no
you
come
out
with
me
said
pratt
come
round
to
the
and
and
have
a
drink
and
we
can
talk
you
have
a
better
appetite
for
your
supper
when
you
come
back
he
added
with
a
wink
i
a
profitable
job
for
you
glad
to
hear
it
sir
replied
murgatroyd
i
can
do
with
aught
of
that
sort
i
assure
you
he
went
into
the
parlour
said
a
word
or
two
to
some
person
within
and
came
out
again
not
much
business
doing
at
present
pratt
he
said
as
he
and
his
visitor
turned
into
the
street
gets
slacker
than
ever
then
you
do
with
a
slice
of
good
luck
remarked
pratt
it
just
happens
that
i
can
put
a
bit
in
your
way
he
led
murgatroyd
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
stood
a
corner
tavern
into
a
of
which
pratt
turned
as
if
he
were
well
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
the
place
walking
down
a
narrow
passage
he
conducted
his
companion
into
a
small
parlour
at
that
moment
untenanted
pointed
him
to
a
seat
in
the
corner
and
rang
the
bell
five
minutes
later
having
provided
murgatroyd
with
rum
and
water
and
a
cigar
he
turned
on
him
with
a
direct
question
look
here
he
said
in
a
low
voice
would
a
hundred
pounds
be
any
use
to
you
murgatroyd
cheeks
flushed
it
be
a
fortune
he
answered
with
fervour
a
hundred
pound
bless
you
pratt
it
many
a
year
since
i
saw
a
hundred
pound
of
my
own
all
in
one
lump
pratt
pulled
out
his
roll
of
fluttered
it
in
his
face
laid
it
on
the
table
and
set
an
ashtray
on
it
there
a
hundred
pounds
there
he
said
it
yours
to
pick
up
if
you
do
a
little
job
for
me
easy
job
too
you
never
earn
a
hundred
pounds
so
easy
in
your
life
murgatroyd
pricked
up
his
ears
according
to
his
ideas
money
easily
come
by
was
seldom
honestly
earned
he
stirred
uncomfortably
in
his
seat
so
long
as
it
a
straight
job
he
muttered
i
do
want
straight
enough
as
straight
as
it
easy
answered
pratt
it
may
seem
a
bit
mysterious
but
there
reasons
for
that
i
give
you
my
word
it
all
right
all
a
mere
bit
of
diplomacy
and
that
nobody
ever
know
you
in
it
that
is
beyond
a
certain
stage
and
that
there
no
danger
to
you
what
is
it
asked
murgatroyd
still
uneasy
and
doubtful
pratt
pulled
the
evening
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
murgatroyd
the
advertisement
signed
halstead
byner
you
see
that
he
said
information
wanted
about
parrawhite
do
you
remember
parrawhite
he
once
served
you
with
some
papers
in
that
affair
in
which
we
were
against
you
i
remember
him
answered
murgatroyd
i
seen
him
in
here
now
and
again
so
he
wanted
is
he
i
did
know
he
left
the
town
left
last
november
said
pratt
and
there
are
folks
influential
folks
as
you
can
guess
seeing
that
they
can
throw
a
hundred
pounds
away
who
do
want
any
inquiries
made
for
him
in
barford
they
mind
those
folks
how
many
inquiries
and
searches
are
made
for
him
anywhere
else
but
not
here
well
asked
murgatroyd
anxiously
this
is
it
replied
pratt
you
do
a
bit
now
and
then
as
agent
for
some
of
these
shipping
lines
you
book
passages
for
emigrants
and
for
other
people
going
to
new
zealand
or
canada
or
timbuctoo
never
mind
where
now
then
could
you
remember
i
sure
you
could
that
you
booked
a
passage
for
parrawhite
to
america
last
november
come
it
an
easy
matter
to
remember
is
that
for
a
hundred
pounds
murgatroyd
thin
fingers
trembled
a
little
as
he
picked
up
his
glass
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
exactly
he
asked
this
said
pratt
i
want
you
tomorrow
morning
early
to
send
a
telegram
to
these
people
halstead
byner
martin
chambers
london
just
saying
that
james
parrawhite
left
barford
for
america
on
november
last
and
that
you
can
give
further
information
if
necessary
and
what
if
it
is
necessary
inquired
murgatroyd
then
in
answer
to
any
letter
or
telegram
of
inquiry
you
just
say
that
you
knew
parrawhite
by
sight
as
a
clerk
at
eldrick
pascoe
in
this
town
that
on
november
he
told
you
that
he
was
going
to
emigrate
to
america
that
next
day
you
booked
him
his
passage
for
which
he
paid
you
whatever
it
was
and
that
he
thereupon
set
off
for
liverpool
see
it
all
lies
you
know
muttered
murgatroyd
nobody
can
find
out
anyway
replied
pratt
that
the
one
important
thing
to
consider
you
safe
and
if
you
cursed
with
a
conscience
and
it
tender
well
that
make
a
good
plaister
for
it
he
pointed
to
the
little
wad
of
and
the
man
sitting
at
his
side
followed
the
pointing
finger
with
hungry
eyes
murgatroyd
wanted
money
badly
his
business
always
poor
was
becoming
worse
his
shipping
agency
rarely
produced
any
result
his
rent
was
in
arrears
he
owed
money
to
his
he
had
a
wife
and
young
children
to
such
a
man
a
hundred
pounds
meant
relief
comfort
the
lifting
of
pressure
you
sure
there
naught
wrong
in
it
pratt
he
asked
abruptly
and
assiduously
it
be
a
bad
job
for
my
family
if
anything
happened
to
me
you
know
there
naught
that
will
happen
answered
pratt
confidently
who
on
earth
can
contradict
you
who
knows
what
people
you
sell
passages
to
but
yourself
there
the
folks
themselves
replied
murgatroyd
suppose
parrawhite
turns
up
he
wo
exclaimed
pratt
you
know
where
he
is
suggested
murgatroyd
not
exactly
said
pratt
but
he
left
this
country
for
another
further
off
than
america
that
certain
and
the
folks
i
referred
to
do
want
any
inquiry
about
him
here
if
i
am
asked
questions
later
am
i
to
say
he
booked
in
his
own
name
inquired
murgatroyd
no
name
of
parsons
responded
pratt
here
i
write
down
for
you
exactly
what
i
want
you
to
say
in
the
telegram
to
halstead
byner
and
i
make
a
few
memoranda
for
you
to
post
you
up
in
case
they
write
for
further
information
i
have
said
that
i
do
it
remarked
murgatroyd
i
do
like
the
looks
of
it
it
all
a
pack
of
lies
pratt
paid
no
heed
to
this
moral
reflection
he
found
some
loose
paper
in
his
pocket
and
scribbled
on
it
for
a
while
then
as
if
accidentally
he
moved
the
and
the
beneath
it
all
new
gave
forth
a
crisp
rustling
sound
here
you
are
said
pratt
pushing
notes
and
memoranda
towards
his
companion
take
the
brass
man
you
do
get
a
job
like
that
every
day
and
murgatroyd
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
presently
went
home
persuading
himself
that
everything
would
be
all
right
chapter
xxiii
smooth
face
and
anxious
brain
byner
watched
eldrick
and
collingwood
inquisitively
as
they
bent
over
halstead
telegram
he
was
not
surprised
when
collingwood
merely
nodded
in
silence
nor
when
eldrick
turned
excitedly
in
his
own
direction
there
what
did
i
tell
you
he
exclaimed
there
been
no
murder
the
man
left
the
town
probably
pratt
helped
him
off
could
have
better
proof
than
that
wire
what
do
you
take
that
wire
to
prove
then
mr
eldrick
asked
byner
take
it
to
prove
answered
eldrick
why
that
parrawhite
booked
a
passage
to
america
with
this
man
murgatroyd
last
november
clear
enough
that
what
do
you
take
it
to
prove
mr
collingwood
continued
the
inquiry
agent
as
he
turned
to
the
barrister
with
a
smile
before
i
take
it
for
anything
replied
collingwood
i
want
to
know
who
murgatroyd
is
byner
looked
at
eldrick
and
laughed
precisely
he
said
who
is
murgatroyd
perhaps
eldrick
knows
i
do
just
know
that
he
a
man
who
carries
on
a
small
watch
and
clock
business
in
a
poorish
part
of
the
town
and
that
he
has
some
sort
of
a
shipping
agency
answered
eldrick
but
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
whatever
message
it
is
that
he
sent
to
your
partner
in
london
this
morning
has
not
been
sent
in
good
faith
i
do
imply
anything
answered
byner
all
i
say
is
before
i
attach
any
value
to
his
message
i
like
collingwood
want
to
know
something
about
the
sender
he
may
have
been
put
up
to
sending
it
he
may
be
in
collusion
with
somebody
now
eldrick
you
can
come
in
here
strongly
i
do
want
to
be
seen
in
this
affair
yet
will
you
go
and
see
murgatroyd
tell
him
his
wire
to
halstead
byner
in
london
has
been
communicated
to
you
here
ask
him
for
further
particulars
and
then
drop
in
on
me
at
my
hotel
and
tell
me
what
you
learnt
i
be
found
in
the
there
any
time
after
onward
eldrick
intense
curiosity
in
what
was
rapidly
becoming
a
fascinating
mystery
to
him
led
him
to
accept
this
embassy
and
a
little
before
three
he
walked
into
the
at
the
and
discovered
byner
in
a
comfortable
corner
i
seen
murgatroyd
he
whispered
as
he
took
an
adjacent
chair
decent
honest
enough
man
very
poor
i
should
say
he
tells
a
plain
enough
story
parrawhite
whom
he
knew
as
one
of
our
clerks
told
him
last
november
he
was
exact
about
dates
then
was
he
interrupted
byner
he
mentioned
them
readily
enough
replied
the
solicitor
but
to
go
on
parrawhite
mentioned
to
him
november
last
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
america
at
once
murgatroyd
told
him
about
bookings
parrawhite
called
very
early
next
morning
paid
for
his
passage
under
the
name
of
parsons
and
went
off
en
route
for
liverpool
of
course
so
there
you
are
that
all
murgatroyd
could
tell
inquired
byner
that
all
he
knows
answered
eldrick
you
say
murgatroyd
knew
parrawhite
as
one
of
your
clerks
asked
byner
after
a
moment
thought
we
had
some
process
in
hand
against
this
man
last
autumn
replied
eldrick
i
dare
say
parrawhite
served
him
with
papers
would
he
murgatroyd
be
likely
to
know
pratt
continued
byner
he
might
in
the
same
connection
admitted
eldrick
byner
smoked
in
silence
for
a
while
do
you
know
what
i
think
mr
eldrick
he
said
at
last
i
think
pratt
put
up
murgatroyd
to
sending
that
telegram
to
us
in
london
this
morning
you
do
exclaimed
eldrick
surely
and
now
continued
the
inquiry
agent
if
you
will
you
can
do
more
much
more
without
appearing
to
do
anything
pratt
office
is
only
a
few
minutes
away
can
you
drop
in
there
making
some
excuse
and
while
there
mention
more
or
less
casually
that
parrawhite
or
information
about
him
is
wanted
that
you
and
a
certain
halstead
byner
are
advertising
for
him
that
you
just
seen
murgatroyd
in
respect
of
a
communication
which
he
wired
to
halstead
this
morning
and
that
most
important
of
all
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
is
awaiting
parrawhite
do
forget
the
last
bit
of
news
why
that
particularly
asked
eldrick
because
answered
byner
solemnly
i
want
pratt
to
know
that
the
search
for
parrawhite
is
going
to
be
a
thorough
one
eldrick
went
off
on
his
second
mission
promising
to
return
in
due
course
within
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
pratt
office
talking
over
some
unimportant
matter
of
business
which
he
had
invented
as
he
went
along
it
was
not
until
he
was
on
the
point
of
departure
that
he
referred
to
the
real
reason
of
his
visit
did
you
notice
that
parrawhite
is
being
advertised
for
he
asked
suddenly
turning
on
his
old
clerk
pratt
was
ready
for
this
had
been
ready
ever
since
eldrick
walked
in
he
affected
a
fine
surprise
parrawhite
he
exclaimed
why
who
advertising
for
him
do
you
see
the
newspapers
asked
eldrick
pointing
to
some
which
lay
about
the
room
it
in
there
there
an
advertisement
of
mine
and
one
of
halstead
byner
of
london
pratt
picked
up
a
barford
paper
and
looked
at
the
advertisements
with
a
clever
affectation
of
having
never
seen
them
before
i
have
had
much
time
for
newspaper
reading
this
last
day
or
two
he
remarked
advertisements
for
him
from
two
quarters
acting
together
acting
together
you
know
replied
eldrick
those
people
who
really
want
him
halstead
byner
inquiry
agents
working
for
a
firm
of
city
solicitors
i
only
local
agent
as
it
were
had
any
response
mr
eldrick
asked
pratt
throwing
aside
the
paper
any
one
come
forward
yes
answered
eldrick
watching
pratt
narrowly
without
seeming
to
do
so
this
morning
a
man
named
murgatroyd
in
peel
row
who
does
a
bit
of
shipping
agency
wired
to
halstead
byner
to
say
that
he
booked
parrawhite
to
new
york
last
november
of
course
they
at
once
communicated
with
me
and
i
just
been
to
see
murgatroyd
he
that
man
watchmaker
we
had
some
proceedings
against
last
year
oh
that
man
said
pratt
thought
the
name
was
familiar
i
remember
him
and
what
does
he
say
just
about
as
much
as
and
little
more
than
he
said
in
his
wire
to
london
replied
eldrick
booked
parrawhite
to
america
november
last
and
believes
he
left
for
liverpool
there
and
then
ah
remarked
pratt
that
explains
it
then
explains
what
asked
eldrick
pratt
gave
his
old
employer
a
look
confidential
and
significant
explains
why
he
took
that
money
out
of
your
desk
he
said
you
remember
forty
odd
pounds
he
use
some
of
that
for
his
america
eh
now
i
suppose
he
vanished
for
good
then
it
not
very
likely
he
ever
be
heard
of
from
across
there
eldrick
laughed
meaningly
of
set
purpose
we
do
know
that
he
gone
there
he
observed
he
might
get
beyond
liverpool
you
know
anyhow
we
going
to
make
a
very
good
search
for
him
here
in
barford
first
we
nothing
but
word
for
his
having
set
out
for
liverpool
what
he
wanted
for
asked
pratt
as
unconcernedly
as
possible
been
up
to
something
no
answered
eldrick
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
a
relation
has
left
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
that
what
he
wanted
for
and
why
he
must
be
found
or
his
death
proved
he
gave
pratt
another
quick
glance
and
went
off
to
return
to
the
hotel
and
byner
to
whom
he
at
once
gave
a
faithful
account
of
what
had
just
taken
place
and
he
did
turn
a
hair
he
remarked
cool
as
a
cucumber
all
through
if
your
theory
is
correct
pratt
a
cleverer
hand
than
i
ever
took
him
for
and
i
always
said
he
was
clever
did
show
anything
when
you
mentioned
murgatroyd
asked
byner
not
a
shred
of
a
thing
replied
eldrick
nor
when
you
spoke
of
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
no
more
than
what
you
might
call
polite
and
interested
surprise
byner
laughed
threw
away
the
end
of
a
cigar
and
rose
out
of
his
lounging
posture
now
eldrick
he
said
leaning
close
to
the
solicitor
between
ourselves
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
next
which
means
at
once
no
replied
eldrick
the
police
whispered
byner
that
my
next
move
just
now
within
a
few
minutes
so
will
you
give
me
a
couple
of
notes
one
to
the
principal
man
here
chief
constable
or
police
superintendent
or
whatever
he
is
and
another
to
the
best
detective
there
is
here
in
your
opinion
they
save
me
a
lot
of
trouble
of
course
if
you
wish
it
answered
eldrick
but
you
do
mean
to
say
you
going
to
have
pratt
arrested
on
what
you
know
up
to
now
not
at
all
replied
byner
much
too
soon
all
i
want
is
detective
help
of
the
strictly
professional
kind
no
we
give
pratt
a
little
more
rope
yet
for
another
say
but
come
now
who
is
the
best
local
detective
a
quiet
steady
fellow
who
knows
how
to
do
his
work
unobtrusively
prydale
the
man
said
eldrick
prydale
i
had
reason
to
employ
him
more
than
once
i
give
you
a
note
to
him
and
one
to
superintendent
waterson
he
went
over
to
a
and
scribbled
a
few
lines
on
of
notepaper
which
he
enclosed
in
envelopes
and
handed
to
byner
i
do
know
what
line
you
taking
he
said
nor
where
it
going
to
end
exactly
but
i
do
know
this
pratt
never
turned
a
hair
when
i
let
out
all
that
to
him
but
if
eldrick
went
away
from
his
old
clerk
fine
new
offices
thinking
that
pratt
was
quite
unperturbed
and
unmoved
by
the
news
he
had
just
acquired
he
was
utterly
mistaken
pratt
was
very
much
perturbed
deeply
moved
not
a
little
frightened
he
had
so
schooled
himself
to
keep
a
straight
and
ever
blank
expression
of
countenance
in
any
sudden
change
of
events
that
he
had
shown
nothing
to
eldrick
but
he
was
none
the
less
upset
by
the
solicitor
last
announcement
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
lying
to
be
picked
up
by
parrawhite
or
by
parrawhite
what
an
unhappy
turn
of
fortune
for
the
would
never
rest
until
either
parrawhite
came
to
light
or
it
was
satisfactorily
established
that
he
was
dead
and
if
search
begun
to
be
made
in
barford
where
might
not
that
search
end
unmoved
cool
if
eldrick
had
turned
back
he
would
have
found
that
pratt
had
suddenly
given
way
to
a
fit
of
nerves
but
that
soon
passed
and
pratt
began
to
think
he
left
his
office
early
and
betook
himself
to
his
favourite
gymnasium
exercise
did
him
good
he
thought
a
lot
while
he
was
exercising
and
once
more
instead
of
going
home
to
dinner
he
dined
in
town
and
he
sat
late
over
his
dinner
in
a
snug
corner
of
the
restaurant
and
he
thought
and
planned
and
schemed
and
after
twilight
had
fallen
on
barford
he
went
out
and
made
his
way
to
peel
row
he
must
see
murgatroyd
again
at
once
along
peel
row
pratt
stopped
suddenly
and
with
sudden
fear
out
of
a
side
street
emerged
a
man
a
quiet
man
whom
he
knew
very
well
indeed
prydale
he
was
accompanied
by
a
much
younger
man
whom
pratt
remembered
to
have
seen
in
beck
street
that
afternoon
a
stranger
to
him
and
to
barford
and
as
he
watched
these
two
covered
the
narrow
roadway
and
walked
into
murgatroyd
shop
chapter
xxiv
the
better
half
under
the
warming
influence
of
two
glasses
of
rum
and
water
and
lulled
by
pratt
assurance
that
all
would
be
well
murgatroyd
had
carried
home
his
hundred
pounds
with
pretty
much
the
same
feeling
which
permeates
a
man
who
having
been
within
measurable
distance
of
drowning
suddenly
finds
a
substantial
piece
of
timber
drifting
his
way
and
takes
a
firm
grip
on
it
after
all
a
hundred
pounds
was
a
hundred
pounds
he
would
be
able
to
pay
his
rent
and
his
rates
and
give
something
to
the
grocer
and
the
butcher
and
the
baker
and
the
milkman
the
children
should
have
some
new
clothes
and
boots
when
all
this
was
done
there
would
be
a
nice
balance
left
over
and
it
was
pratt
affair
when
all
was
said
and
done
and
if
any
trouble
arose
why
pratt
would
have
to
settle
it
so
he
ate
his
supper
with
the
better
appetite
which
pratt
had
prophesied
and
he
slept
more
satisfactorily
than
usual
and
next
morning
he
went
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
and
sent
off
the
stipulated
telegram
to
halstead
byner
in
london
and
hoped
that
there
was
the
end
of
the
matter
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
then
shortly
after
noon
in
walked
eldrick
one
of
the
tribe
which
murgatroyd
dreaded
having
had
various
dealings
with
solicitors
in
the
way
of
writs
and
summonses
and
began
to
ask
questions
murgatroyd
emerged
from
that
ordeal
very
satisfactorily
questions
were
few
elementary
and
easily
answered
there
were
no
signs
of
suspicion
about
him
and
murgatroyd
breathed
more
freely
when
he
was
gone
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
solicitor
visit
would
certainly
wind
things
up
for
him
eldrick
asked
all
that
could
be
asked
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
he
had
replied
now
he
would
probably
be
bothered
no
more
his
spirits
had
assumed
quite
a
cheerful
tone
by
evening
but
they
received
a
rude
shock
when
summoned
from
his
little
workshop
to
the
front
premises
he
found
himself
confronting
one
man
whom
he
certainly
knew
to
be
a
detective
and
another
who
might
be
one
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
conceal
some
agitation
and
prydale
a
shrewdly
observant
man
noticed
it
and
affected
not
to
evening
murgatroyd
he
said
cheerily
we
come
to
see
if
you
can
give
us
a
bit
of
information
you
had
eldrick
the
lawyer
here
today
on
the
same
business
you
know
this
affair
of
an
old
clerk
of
his
parrawhite
i
told
eldrick
all
i
know
muttered
murgatroyd
very
likely
replied
prydale
but
there
a
few
questions
this
gentleman
and
myself
would
like
to
ask
can
we
come
in
murgatroyd
fetched
his
wife
to
mind
the
shop
and
took
the
callers
into
the
parlour
which
she
had
unwillingly
vacated
he
knew
prydale
by
sight
and
reputation
about
byner
he
wondered
finally
he
set
him
down
as
a
detective
from
london
and
was
all
the
more
afraid
of
him
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
when
the
three
men
were
alone
i
do
think
there
anything
that
i
did
tell
mr
eldrick
oh
there
a
great
deal
that
eldrick
did
ask
said
prydale
eldrick
sort
of
just
skirted
round
things
like
we
want
to
know
a
bit
more
this
parrawhite
got
to
be
found
d
see
murgatroyd
and
as
you
seem
to
be
the
last
man
who
had
aught
to
do
with
him
in
barford
why
naturally
we
come
to
you
now
to
start
with
you
say
he
came
to
you
about
getting
a
passage
to
america
just
so
now
when
would
that
be
day
before
he
did
get
it
answered
murgatroyd
rapidly
thinking
over
the
memoranda
which
pratt
had
jotted
down
for
his
benefit
that
said
prydale
would
be
on
the
yes
replied
murgatroyd
november
of
course
what
time
now
on
the
asked
the
detective
time
said
murgatroyd
oh
in
the
evening
bit
vague
remarked
prydale
what
time
in
the
evening
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
replied
murgatroyd
it
be
just
about
eight
i
was
thinking
of
closing
ah
said
prydale
with
a
glance
at
byner
who
had
already
told
him
of
parrawhite
presence
at
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
a
good
two
miles
away
at
the
hour
which
murgatroyd
mentioned
ah
he
was
here
in
your
shop
at
eight
on
the
evening
of
november
last
asking
about
a
ticket
to
america
new
york
muttered
murgatroyd
and
he
came
next
morning
and
bought
one
asked
the
detective
i
told
eldrick
that
said
murgatroyd
a
little
sullenly
how
much
did
it
cost
inquired
byner
eight
pound
ten
replied
murgatroyd
usual
price
what
did
he
pay
for
it
in
continued
prydale
he
gave
me
a
note
and
i
gave
him
thirty
shillings
change
answered
murgatroyd
just
so
assented
prydale
now
what
line
might
that
be
by
murgatroyd
was
becoming
uneasy
under
all
these
questions
and
his
uneasiness
was
deepened
by
the
way
in
which
both
his
visitors
watched
him
he
was
a
man
who
would
have
been
a
bad
witness
in
any
case
nervous
ill
at
ease
suspicious
inclined
to
boggle
and
in
this
instance
he
was
being
forced
to
invent
answers
it
was
oh
the
royal
atlantic
he
answered
at
last
i
an
agency
for
them
so
i
noticed
from
the
bills
and
placards
in
your
window
observed
the
detective
and
of
course
you
issue
these
tickets
on
their
paper
seen
before
you
fill
up
particulars
on
a
form
and
a
counterfoil
do
you
and
you
send
a
copy
of
those
particulars
to
the
royal
atlantic
offices
at
liverpool
murgatroyd
nodded
silently
this
was
much
more
than
he
bargained
for
and
he
did
not
know
how
much
further
it
was
going
and
prydale
gave
him
a
sudden
searching
look
can
you
show
us
the
counterfoil
in
this
instance
he
asked
murgatroyd
flushed
but
he
managed
to
get
out
a
fairly
quick
reply
no
i
ca
he
answered
i
sent
that
book
back
at
the
end
of
the
year
oh
well
they
have
it
at
liverpool
observed
prydale
we
can
get
at
it
there
of
course
they
have
your
record
of
the
entire
transaction
he
be
down
on
their
passenger
list
under
the
name
of
parsons
i
think
mr
murgatroyd
he
gave
me
that
name
said
murgatroyd
prydale
gave
byner
a
look
and
both
rose
i
think
that
about
all
said
the
detective
of
course
our
next
inquiry
will
be
at
liverpool
the
royal
atlantic
thank
you
murgatroyd
much
obliged
before
the
watchmaker
could
collect
himself
sufficiently
to
say
or
ask
more
prydale
and
his
companion
had
walked
out
of
the
shop
and
gone
away
and
then
murgatroyd
realized
that
he
was
in
for
but
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
in
for
what
he
did
know
was
that
if
prydale
went
or
sent
over
to
liverpool
the
whole
thing
would
burst
like
a
bubble
for
the
royal
atlantic
people
would
tell
the
detectives
at
once
that
no
passenger
named
parsons
had
sailed
under
their
auspices
on
november
last
and
that
he
murgatroyd
had
been
telling
a
pack
of
lies
murgatroyd
a
woman
whose
wits
had
been
sharpened
by
a
ten
years
daily
acquaintance
with
poverty
came
out
of
the
shop
into
the
parlour
and
looked
searchingly
at
her
husband
what
did
them
fellows
want
she
demanded
i
knew
one
of
prydale
the
detective
now
what
up
reuben
more
trouble
murgatroyd
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
told
his
wife
the
whole
story
concealing
nothing
if
they
go
to
the
royal
atlantic
it
all
come
out
he
groaned
i
could
make
any
excuse
or
explanation
anyhow
what
to
be
done
you
should
ha
had
naught
to
do
wi
that
pratt
exclaimed
murgatroyd
a
scoundrelly
fellow
to
come
and
tempt
poor
folk
to
do
his
dirty
work
where
the
money
locked
up
answered
murgatroyd
i
have
touched
a
penny
of
it
i
thought
i
wait
a
bit
and
see
if
aught
happened
but
he
assured
me
it
was
all
right
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
a
hundred
pound
come
our
way
every
day
we
want
money
not
at
that
price
said
his
wife
you
can
pay
too
much
for
money
my
lad
i
wish
you
told
me
what
that
pratt
was
after
he
should
have
heard
a
bit
o
my
tongue
if
i
only
known
just
then
the
shop
door
opened
and
pratt
walked
in
he
at
once
saw
murgatroyd
and
his
wife
standing
between
shop
and
parlour
and
realized
at
a
glance
that
his
secret
in
this
instance
was
his
no
longer
well
he
said
walking
up
to
the
watchmaker
you
had
prydale
here
and
you
eldrick
this
morning
of
course
you
knew
what
to
say
to
both
i
wish
we
never
had
you
here
last
night
young
man
exclaimed
murgatroyd
fiercely
what
right
have
you
to
come
here
making
trouble
for
folk
that
got
plenty
already
but
at
any
rate
ours
was
honest
trouble
yours
is
like
to
land
my
husband
in
dishonesty
if
it
done
so
already
and
if
my
husband
had
only
spoken
to
me
just
let
your
husband
speak
a
bit
now
interrupted
pratt
almost
insolently
it
you
that
making
all
the
trouble
or
noise
anyhow
there
naught
to
fuss
about
missis
what
upset
you
murgatroyd
they
going
to
the
royal
atlantic
people
muttered
the
watchmaker
of
course
it
all
come
out
then
they
know
that
i
never
booked
any
parsons
nor
anybody
else
for
that
matter
last
november
you
should
thought
o
that
pratt
realized
that
the
man
was
right
he
had
never
thought
of
that
never
anticipated
that
inquiry
would
go
beyond
murgatroyd
but
his
keen
wits
at
once
set
to
work
what
the
system
he
asked
quickly
tell
me
what
done
when
you
book
anybody
like
that
come
on
explain
quick
murgatroyd
turned
to
a
drawer
and
pulled
out
a
book
and
some
papers
it
simple
enough
he
said
i
this
book
of
forms
d
see
i
fill
up
this
form
sort
of
ticket
or
pass
for
the
passenger
and
hand
it
to
him
it
a
receipt
as
well
to
him
then
i
enter
the
same
particulars
on
that
counterfoil
then
i
fill
up
one
of
these
papers
giving
just
the
same
particulars
and
post
it
at
once
to
the
company
with
the
passage
money
less
my
commission
when
one
of
these
books
is
finished
i
return
the
counterfoils
to
liverpool
they
check
prydale
up
to
all
that
he
asked
to
see
the
counterfoil
in
this
case
i
had
to
say
i
had
got
it
i
sent
it
to
the
company
of
course
he
find
out
that
i
did
lies
said
murgatroyd
vindictively
and
they
did
start
us
neither
who
was
that
other
man
with
prydale
asked
pratt
london
detective
i
should
say
answered
the
watchmaker
and
judging
by
the
way
he
watched
me
a
sharp
too
what
impression
did
you
get
altogether
demanded
pratt
why
that
they
going
to
sift
this
affair
whatever
it
is
right
down
to
the
bottom
exclaimed
murgatroyd
they
either
going
to
find
parrawhite
or
get
to
know
what
became
of
him
that
my
impression
and
what
am
i
going
to
do
now
this
lose
me
what
bit
of
business
done
with
yon
shipping
firm
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
pratt
scornfully
do
be
a
fool
you
all
right
you
listen
to
me
you
write
straight
off
to
the
royal
atlantic
tell
you
had
some
inquiry
made
about
a
man
named
parsons
who
booked
a
passage
with
you
for
new
york
last
november
say
that
on
looking
up
your
books
you
found
that
you
unaccountably
forgot
to
send
them
the
forms
for
him
and
his
passage
money
make
out
a
form
for
that
date
and
crumple
it
up
as
if
it
had
been
left
lying
in
a
drawer
enclose
the
money
in
it
here
i
give
you
ten
pounds
to
cover
it
he
went
on
drawing
a
from
his
purse
get
it
off
at
once
time
now
plenty
to
catch
the
at
the
general
and
then
d
see
you
all
right
it
only
a
case
then
as
far
as
concerned
of
forgetfulness
what
that
we
all
forget
something
in
business
now
and
then
they
overlook
that
when
they
get
the
money
aye
but
you
forgetting
something
now
remarked
murgatroyd
forgetting
this
no
such
passenger
ever
went
they
know
that
by
their
passenger
lists
what
the
devil
has
that
to
do
with
it
snarled
pratt
impatiently
what
the
devil
do
we
care
whether
any
such
passenger
went
or
not
all
that
you
concerned
about
is
to
prove
that
you
issued
a
ticket
to
parrawhite
under
the
name
of
parsons
what
it
matter
to
you
where
parrawhite
parsons
went
when
he
once
left
your
shop
you
naturally
thought
he
go
straight
to
the
lancashire
and
yorkshire
station
on
his
way
to
liverpool
and
new
york
but
for
aught
you
know
he
may
have
fallen
down
a
drain
pipe
in
the
next
street
do
you
see
man
there
nothing
there
nobody
not
all
the
detectives
in
london
and
barford
can
prove
that
you
did
issue
a
ticket
to
parrawhite
on
that
date
it
is
up
to
you
to
prove
that
you
did
it
up
to
them
to
prove
that
you
did
and
they
ca
it
impossible
you
get
that
letter
off
at
once
to
liverpool
with
that
money
inside
it
and
as
safe
as
houses
and
your
hundred
pounds
as
well
get
it
done
and
if
those
chaps
come
asking
any
more
questions
tell
you
not
going
to
answer
a
single
one
mind
you
do
what
i
tell
you
and
you
safe
with
that
pratt
walked
out
of
the
shop
and
went
off
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
inwardly
raging
and
disturbed
it
was
very
evident
that
these
people
meant
to
find
parrawhite
alive
or
dead
evident
too
that
they
had
called
in
the
aid
of
the
barford
police
and
in
spite
of
all
his
assurances
to
the
watchmaker
and
his
suggestion
for
the
next
move
pratt
was
far
from
easy
about
the
whole
matter
he
would
have
been
easier
if
he
had
known
who
prydale
companion
was
probably
he
was
as
murgatroyd
had
suggested
a
london
detective
who
might
have
been
making
inquiries
in
the
town
for
some
time
and
knew
much
more
than
he
pratt
could
surmise
that
was
the
devil
of
the
whole
thing
in
opinion
adept
himself
in
working
underground
he
feared
people
who
adopted
the
same
tactics
what
was
this
stranger
chap
after
what
did
he
know
what
was
he
doing
had
he
let
eldrick
know
anything
was
there
a
web
of
detectives
already
being
spun
around
himself
was
that
silly
unfortunate
affair
with
parrawhite
being
slowly
brought
to
light
to
wreck
him
on
the
very
beginning
of
what
he
meant
to
be
a
brilliant
career
he
cursed
parrawhite
again
and
again
as
he
left
peel
row
behind
him
the
events
of
the
day
had
made
pratt
cautious
as
well
as
anxious
he
decided
to
keep
away
from
his
lodgings
that
night
and
when
he
reached
the
centre
of
the
town
he
took
a
room
at
a
quiet
hotel
he
was
up
early
next
morning
he
had
breakfasted
by
eight
by
eight
he
was
at
his
office
and
in
his
he
found
one
letter
a
thickish
package
which
had
not
come
by
post
but

been
dropped
in
by
hand
and
was
merely
addressed
to
pratt
pratt
tore
that
package
open
with
a
conviction
of
imminent
disaster
he
pulled
out
a
sheet
of
cheap
and
a
wad
of
his
face
worked
curiously
as
he
read
a
few
lines
scrawled
in
illiterate
female
handwriting
mr

dry
sherry
pratt
wasted
no
time
in
cursing
murgatroyd
there
would
be
plenty
of
opportunity
for
such
relief
to
his
feelings
later
on
just
then
he
had
other
matters
to
occupy
him
fully
he
tore
the
indignant
letter
to
shreds
he
hastily
thrust
the
into
one
pocket
and
drew
his
keys
from
another
within
five
minutes
he
had
taken
from
his
safe
a
sealed
packet
which
he
placed
in
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
had
left
his
office
for
the
last
time
as
he
knew
very
well
that
part
of
the
game
was
up
and
it
was
necessary
to
be
smart
in
entering
on
another
phase
of
it
since
eldrick
visit
of
the
previous
day
pratt
had
been
prepared
for
all
eventuality
he
had
made
ready
for
flight
and
he
was
not
going
he
had
a
considerable
amount
of
mallathorpe
money
in
his
possession
by
obtaining
her
signature
to
one
or
two
documents
he
could
easily
obtain
much
more
in
london
at
an
hour
notice
those
documents
were
all
ready
and
in
the
sealed
packet
which
he
had
just
taken
from
the
safe
in
it
too
were
some
other
documents
john
mallathorpe
will
the
letter
which
mallathorpe
had
written
to
him
on
the
evening
previous
to
her
son
fatal
accident
and
the
power
of
attorney
which
pratt
had
obtained
from
her
at
his
first
interview
after
that
occurrence
all
was
ready
and
now
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
to
normandale
grange
see
mallathorpe
and
vanish
he
had
planned
it
all
out
carefully
when
he
perceived
the
first
danger
signals
and
knew
that
his
other
plans
and
schemes
were
doomed
to
failure
half
an
hour
at
normandale
grange
a
journey
to
london
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
city
and
then
the
next
train
to
the
continent
on
his
way
to
regions
much
further
off
here
things
had
turned
out
badly
unexpectedly
badly
but
he
would
carry
away
considerable
easily
transported
wealth
to
a
new
career
in
a
new
country
pratt
began
his
flight
in
methodical
fashion
he
locked
up
his
office
and
left
the
building
by
a
back
entrance
which
took
him
into
a
network
of
courts
and
alleys
at
the
rear
of
the
business
part
of
barford
he
made
his
way
in
and
out
of
these
places
until
he
reached
a
shop
in
an
obscure
street
whereat
he
had
left
a
machine
of
his
own
on
the
previous
evening
under
the
excuse
of
having
it
thoroughly
cleaned
and
oiled
it
was
all
ready
for
him
on
his
arrival
and
he
presently
mounted
it
and
rode
away
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
carefully
choosing
the
less
frequented
streets
and
roads
he
rode
on
until
he
was
clear
of
barford
until
in
fact
he
was
some
miles
from
it
and
had
reached
a
village
which
was
certainly
not
on
the
way
to
normandale
and
then
at
the
he
dismounted
and
going
inside
wrote
out
and
dispatched
a
telegram
it
was
a
brief
message
containing
but
three
words
one
as
usual
and
it
was
addressed
esther
mawson
the
grange
normandale
this
done
he
remounted
his
bicycle
rode
out
of
the
village
and
turned
across
country
in
quite
a
different
direction
it
was
not
yet
ten
he
had
three
hours
to
spare
before
the
time
came
for
keeping
the
appointment
which
he
had
just
made
at
an
early
stage
of
his
operations
pratt
had
found
that
even
the
cleverest
of
schemers
can
not
work
unaided
it
had
been
absolutely
necessary
to
have
some
tool
close
at
hand
to
normandale
grange
and
its
inhabitants
to
have
some
person
there
upon
whom
he
could
depend
for
news
he
had
found
that
person
that
tool
in
esther
mawson
who
as
mallathorpe
maid
had
opportunities
which
he
at
once
recognized
as
being
likely
to
be
of
the
greatest
value
to
him
the
circumstances
of
harper
mallathorpe
death
had
thrown
pratt
and
the
maid
together
and
he
had
quickly
discovered
that
she
was
to
be
bought
and
would
do
anything
for
money
he
had
soon
come
to
an
understanding
with
her
soon
bargained
with
her
and
made
her
a
willing
accomplice
in
certain
of
his
schemes
without
letting
her
know
their
full
meaning
and
extent
all
indeed
that
she
had
learned
from
pratt
was
that
he
had
some
considerable
hold
on
her
mistress
but
it
is
dangerous
work
to
play
with
edged
tools
and
if
pratt
had
only
known
it
he
was
running
great
risks
in
using
esther
mawson
as
a
esther
mawson
was
in
constant
touch
with
her
mistress
and
mallathorpe
afraid
of
her
daughter
and
not
greatly
in
sympathy
with
her
badly
needed
a
confidante
little
by
little
the
mistress
began
to
confide
in
the
maid
and
before
long
esther
mawson
knew
the
secret
and
thenceforward
she
played
a
double
game
pratt
found
her
useful
in
arranging
meetings
with
mallathorpe
unknown
to
nesta
and
he
believed
her
to
be
devoted
to
him
but
the
truth
was
that
esther
mawson
had
only
one
object
of
devotion
herself
and
she
was
waiting
and
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
benefit
that
object
at
pratt
expense
pratt
knew
nothing
of
this
as
he
slowly
made
his
way
to
normandale
that
morning
having
plenty
of
time
he
went
by
devious
and
lonely
roads
and
eventually
he
came
to
the
boundary
of
normandale
park
at
a
point
far
away
from
the
grange
there
he
dismounted
hid
his
bicycle
in
a
coppice
wherein
he
had
often
left
it
before
and
went
on
towards
the
house
through
the
woods
and
plantations
he
knew
every
yard
of
the
ground
he
traversed
and
was
skilled
in
taking
cover
if
he
saw
any
sign
of
woodman
or
gamekeeper
and
in
the
end
just
as
one
chimed
from
the
clock
over
the
stables
he
came
to
a
quiet
spot
in
the
shrubberies
behind
the
grange
and
found
esther
mawson
waiting
for
him
in
an
old
in
which
they
had
met
on
previous
and
similar
occasions
esther
mawson
immediately
realized
that
something
unusual
was
in
the
air
clever
as
pratt
was
at
concealing
his
feelings
she
was
cleverer
in
seeing
small
signs
and
she
saw
that
this
was
no
ordinary
visit
anything
wrong
she
asked
at
once
bit
of
bother
nothing
much
it
blow
over
answered
pratt
who
knew
that
a
certain
amount
of
candour
was
necessary
in
dealing
with
this
woman
but
i
shall
have
to
be
away
for
a
bit
week
or
two
perhaps
you
want
to
see
her
inquired
esther
of
course
i
some
papers
for
her
to
sign
replied
pratt
how
do
things
stand
coast
clear
miss
mallathorpe
going
into
barford
after
lunch
answered
esther
she
be
driving
in
about
two
i
can
manage
it
then
how
long
shall
you
want
to
be
with
her
oh
a
quarter
of
an
hour
do
said
pratt
ten
minutes
if
it
comes
to
that
and
after
that
asked
esther
then
i
want
to
get
a
train
at
scaleby
replied
pratt
mentioning
a
railway
junction
which
lay
ten
miles
across
country
in
another
direction
so
make
it
as
soon
after
as
you
can
you
can
see
her
as
soon
as
miss
mallathorpe
gone
said
esther
you
better
come
into
the
house
i
got
the
key
of
the
turret
door
and
all
clear
the
servants
are
all
at
dinner
i
could
do
with
something
myself
observed
pratt
who
in
his
anxiety
had
only
made
a
light
breakfast
that
morning
can
it
be
managed
i
manage
it
she
answered
come
on
now
behind
the
in
which
they
had
met
a
narrow
path
led
through
the
shrubberies
to
an
old
part
of
the
grange
which
was
never
used
and
was
in
fact
partly
ruinous
esther
mawson
led
the
way
along
this
until
she
and
pratt
came
to
a
turret
in
the
grey
walls
in
the
lower
story
of
which
a
massive
oaken
door
heavily
clamped
with
iron
gave
entrance
to
a
winding
stair
locked
it
from
inside
when
she
and
pratt
had
entered
and
preceded
her
companion
up
the
stair
and
across
one
or
two
empty
and
chambers
to
a
small
room
in
which
a
few
pieces
of
ancient
furniture
were
slowly
dropping
to
decay
pratt
had
taken
refuge
in
this
room
before
and
he
sat
down
in
one
of
the
old
chairs
and
mopped
his
forehead
i
want
something
to
drink
above
everything
he
remarked
what
can
you
get
nothing
but
wine
answered
esther
mawson
as
much
as
you
like
of
that
because
i
a
stock
that
kept
up
in
mallathorpe
room
i
could
get
any
ale
without
going
to
the
butler
i
can
get
wine
and
sandwiches
without
anybody
knowing
that
do
said
pratt
what
sort
of
wine
port
sherry
claret
she
replied
whichever
you
like
sherry
then
answered
pratt
bring
a
bottle
if
you
can
get
it
i
want
a
good
drink
the
woman
went
away
through
the
disused
part
of
the
old
house
into
the
modern
portion
she
went
straight
to
a
certain
store
closet
and
took
from
it
a
bottle
of
old
dry
sherry
which
had
been
brought
there
from
a
bin
in
the
cellars
it
was
part
of
a
quantity
of
fine
wine
laid
down
by
john
mallathorpe
years
before
and
its
original
owner
would
have
been
disgusted
to
think
that
it
should
ever
be
used
for
the
mere
purpose
of
quenching
thirst
but
esther
mawson
had
another
purpose
in
view
with
respect
to
that
bottle
carrying
it
to
her
own
she
carefully
cut
off
the
thick
mass
of
at
its
neck
drew
the
cork
and
poured
a
little
of
the
wine
away
and
that
done
she
unlocked
a
small
box
which
stood
on
a
corner
of
her
dressing
table
and
took
from
it
a
glass
phial
half
full
of
a
colourless
liquid
with
steady
hands
and
sure
fingers
she
dropped
some
of
that
liquid
into
the
wine
carefully
counting
the
drops
then
she
restored
the
phial
to
its
and
the
box
after
which
taking
up
a
spoon
which
lay
on
her
table
she
poured
out
a
little
of
the
sherry
and
smelled
and
tasted
it
no
smell
other
than
that
which
ought
to
be
there
no
taste
other
than
was
proper
pratt
would
suspect
nothing
even
if
he
drunk
the
whole
bottle
esther
mawson
had
anticipated
pratt
desires
in
the
way
of
refreshment
and
she
now
went
to
a
cupboard
and
took
from
it
a
plate
of
sandwiches
carefully
swathed
in
a
napkin
carrying
these
in
one
hand
and
the
bottle
of
sherry
and
a
glass
in
the
other
she
stole
quietly
back
to
the
disused
part
of
the
house
and
set
her
provender
before
its
expectant
consumer
pratt
poured
out
a
glassful
of
the
sherry
and
drank
it
eagerly
good
stuff
that
he
remarked
smacking
his
lips
some
of
old
john
mallathorpe
no
doubt
it
was
here
when
we
came
anyhow
replied
esther
well
i
shall
have
to
go
you
be
all
right
until
i
come
back
what
time
do
you
think
it
be
asked
pratt
make
it
as
soon
as
the
coast
clear
i
want
to
be
off
as
soon
as
ever
she
gone
agreed
esther
i
heard
her
order
the
carriage
for
two
and
no
fear
of
anybody
else
being
about
asked
pratt
that
butler
man
for
instance
or
servants
i
see
to
it
replied
esther
reassuringly
i
lock
this
door
and
take
the
key
until
i
come
back
make
yourself
comfortable
she
locked
pratt
in
the
old
room
and
went
off
and
the
willing
prisoner
ate
his
sandwiches
and
drank
his
sherry
and
looked
out
of
a
mullioned
window
on
the
wide
stretches
of
park
and
coppice
and
the
breezy
moorlands
beyond
he
indulged
in
some
reflections
not
wholly
devoid
of
sentiment
he
had
cherished
dreams
of
becoming
the
virtual
owner
of
normandale
always
confident
in
his
own
powers
he
had
believed
that
with
time
and
patience
he
could
have
persuaded
nesta
mallathorpe
to
marry
him
why
not
now
all
owing
to
that
cursed
and
unfortunate
contretemps
with
parrawhite
that
seemed
utterly
impossible
all
he
could
do
now
was
to
save
himself
and
to
take
as
much
as
he
could
get
more
than
once
that
morning
as
he
made
his
way
across
country
he
had
remembered
parrawhite
advice
to
take
cash
and
be
done
with
it
perhaps
he
reflected
it
might
have
been
better
still
when
he
presently
began
his
final
retreat
he
would
carry
away
with
him
a
lot
of
the
mallathorpe
money
but
before
long
pratt
indulged
in
no
more
reflections
sentiment
or
practical
he
had
eaten
all
his
sandwiches
he
had
drunk
of
the
bottle
of
sherry
and
suddenly
he
felt
unusually
drowsy
and
he
laid
his
head
back
in
his
big
chair
and
fell
soundly
asleep
chapter

the
telephone
message
if
pratt
had
only
known
what
was
going
on
in
the
old
quarries
at
whitcliffe
about
the
very
time
that
he
was
riding
slowly
out
to
barford
on
his
bicycle
he
would
not
only
have
accelerated
his
pace
but
would
have
taken
good
care
to
have
chosen
another
route
he
would
also
have
made
haste
to
exchange
bicycle
for
railway
train
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
have
got
himself
far
away
before
anybody
could
begin
looking
for
him
in
his
usual
haunts
or
at
places
wherein
there
was
a
possibility
of
his
being
found
but
pratt
knew
nothing
of
what
byner
had
done
he
was
conscious
of
byner
visit
to
the
he
did
not
know
what
pickard
had
been
told
by
bill
thomson
he
was
unaware
of
anything
which
pickard
had
told
to
byner
if
he
had
known
that
byner
guided
by
pickard
had
been
to
the
old
quarries
had
fixed
his
inquiring
eye
on
the
shaft
which
was
filled
to
its
brim
with
water
and
had
got
certain
ideas
from
the
mere
sight
of
it
pratt
would
have
hastened
to
put
hundreds
of
miles
between
himself
and
barford
as
quickly
as
possible
but
all
that
pratt
knew
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
suspicion
which
might
materialize
eventually
but
not
immediately
on
the
previous
evening
pratt
had
he
but
known
it
made
a
great
mistake
instead
of
going
into
murgatroyd
shop
after
he
had
watched
byner
and
prydale
away
from
it
he
should
have
followed
those
two
astute
and
crafty
persons
and
have
ascertained
something
of
their
movements
had
he
done
so
he
would
certainly
not
have
troubled
to
return
to
peel
row
nor
to
remain
in
barford
an
hour
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
pratt
was
enough
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
putting
one
and
two
together
and
if
he
had
tracked
prydale
and
the
unknown
man
who
was
with
him
to
a
certain
house
whereto
they
repaired
as
soon
as
they
quitted
murgatroyd
shop
he
would
have
drawn
an
inference
from
the
mere
fact
of
their
visit
which
would
have
thrown
him
into
a
cold
sweat
of
fear
but
pratt
after
all
was
only
one
man
one
brain
one
body
and
could
not
be
in
two
places
nor
go
in
two
ways
at
the
same
time
he
took
his
own
way
ignorant
of
his
destruction
byner
also
took
a
way
of
his
own
as
soon
as
he
and
prydale
left
murgatroyd
shop
they
chartered
the
first
cab
they
met
with
and
ordered
its
driver
to
go
to
whitcliffe
moor
it
the
quickest
thing
to
do
if
my
theory
correct
observed
byner
as
they
drove
along
of
course
it
is
all
theory
mere
theory
but
grounds
for
it
the
place
the
time
mere
lonely
situation
that
scrap
iron
lying
about
which
would
be
so
useful
in
weighting
a
dead
body
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
surprised
if
we
do
find
parrawhite
at
the
bottom
of
that
water
i
should
wonder
agreed
prydale
one
thing
very
certain
as
we
shall
prove
before
we
through
with
it
pratt
put
that
poor
devil
murgatroyd
up
to
this
business
and
a
bit
clumsily
too
fancy
murgatroyd
being
no
better
posted
up
than
to
tell
me
that
parrawhite
called
on
him
at
a
certain
hour
that
night
but
you
got
to
remember
that
pratt
did
know
of
affairs
with
pickard
nor
that
he
was
at
the
at
that
hour
rejoined
byner
my
belief
is
that
pratt
thinks
himself
safe
that
he
fancies
he
provided
for
all
contingencies
if
things
turn
out
as
i
think
they
will
i
believe
we
shall
find
pratt
calmly
seated
at
his
desk
tomorrow
morning
well
if
things
do
turn
out
as
you
expect
we
lose
no
time
in
seeking
him
there
observed
prydale
dryly
we
better
arrange
to
get
the
job
done
first
thing
this
shepherd
make
no
objection
i
suppose
asked
byner
objection
lor
bless
you
he
love
it
exclaimed
prydale
it
be
a
bit
of
welcome
diversion
to
a
man
like
him
that
naught
to
do
object
none
not
he
shepherd
a
retired
who
lived
in
a
picturesque
old
stone
house
in
the
middle
of
whitcliffe
moor
with
nothing
to
occupy
his
attention
but
the
growing
of
roses
and
vegetables
and
an
occasional
glance
at
the
local
newspapers
listened
to
prydale
request
with
gradually
rising
curiosity
byner
had
at
once
seen
that
this
call
was
welcome
to
this
bluff
and
hearty
yorkshireman
who
without
any
question
as
to
their
business
had
immediately
welcomed
them
to
his
hearth
and
pressed
liquor
and
cigars
on
them
he
sized
up
shepherd
as
a
man
to
whom
any
sort
of
break
in
the
placid
course
of
retired
life
was
a
delightful
event
a
dead
man
i
that
old
shaft
i
one
o
my
worked
out
quarries
he
exclaimed
ye
do
mean
to
say

how
long

might
ha
been
there

months

grounds
for
believin
theer
is
what
strong
grounds
replied
the
detective
and
equally
strong
ones
for
believing
the
man
came
there
by
foul
play
too
say
no
more
said
shepherd
t
mystery
shall
be
cleared
up
deary
me
an
to

i
walked

yon

many
a
dozen
times
within
this

remarked
prydale
we

all
the
folk
of
the
neighbourhood

about

and
a
pair
of
grapplin
irons
we
do
it
quiet
and
comfortable
and
we
do
it
reight
odd
character
remarked
byner
when
he
and
prydale
went
away
useful
man
for
a
job
of
that
sort
said
the
detective
laconically
now
then
are
we
going
to
let
anybody
else
know
what
we
after
eldrick
or
collingwood
for
instance
do
you
want
them
or
either
of
them
to
be
present
no
answered
byner
after
a
moment
reflection
let
us
see
what
results
we
can
let
them
know
soon
enough
if
we
anything
to
tell
but
what
about
pratt
keeping
an
eye
on
him
you
mean
said
prydale
you
said
just
now
that
in
your
opinion
we
should
find
him
at
his
desk
just
so
but
that
no
reason
why
he
should
be
looked
after
tomorrow
morning
answered
byner
all
right
i
put
a
man
on
to
shadow
him
from
the
time
he
leaves
his
lodgings
until
until
we
want
him
said
the
detective
that
is
if
we
do
want
him
it
will
be
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
i
ever
had
in
my
life
if
we
do
asserted
byner
i
never
felt
more
certain
of
anything
than
i
do
of
finding
parrawhite
body
in
that
pit
it
was
this
certainty
which
made
byner
appear
extraordinarily
cool
and
collected
when
next
day
about
noon
he
walked
into
eldrick
private
room
where
collingwood
was
at
that
moment
asking
the
solicitor
what
was
being
done
the
certainty
was
now
established
and
it
seemed
to
byner
that
it
would
have
been
a
queer
thing
if
he
had
not
always
had
it
he
closed
the
door
and
gave
the
two
men
an
informing
glance
parrawhite
body
has
been
found
he
said
quietly
eldrick
started
in
his
chair
and
collingwood
looked
a
sharp
inquiry
little
doubt
about
his
having
been
murdered
just
as
i
conjectured
continued
byner
and
his
murderer
had
pretty
cleverly
weighted
his
body
with
scrap
iron
before
dropping
it
into
a
pit
full
of
water
where
it
might
have
remained
for
a
long
time
undiscovered
however
settled
eldrick
got
out
the
first
question
pratt
prydale
after
him
answered
byner
i
expect
we
shall
hear
something
in
a
few
minutes
if
he
in
town
but
i
confess
i
a
bit
doubtful
and
anxious
now
on
that
score
because
when
prydale
and
i
got
down
from
whitcliffe
half
an
hour
ago
where
the
body
now
lying
at
the
awaiting
the
inquest
we
found
murgatroyd
hanging
about
the
police
station
he
come
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
about
pratt
and
it
unfortunately
turns
out
that
pratt
saw
prydale
and
me
go
to
shop
last
night
and
afterwards
went
in
there
himself
and
of
course
pumped
murgatroyd
dry
as
to
why
we
been
why
unfortunately
asked
collingwood
because
that
would
warn
pratt
that
something
was
afoot
said
byner
and
he
may
have
disappeared
during
the
night
he
but
just
then
prydale
came
in
shaking
his
head
i
afraid
he
off
he
announced
i
a
man
watching
for
him
outside
his
lodgings
from
an
early
hour
this
morning
but
he
never
came
out
and
finally
my
man
made
an
excuse
and
asked
for
him
there
and
then
he
heard
that
he
never
been
home
last
night
and
his
office
is
closed
what
steps
are
you
taking
asked
byner
i
got
men
all
over
the
place
already
replied
prydale
but
if
he
got
off
in
the
night
as
i
afraid
he
did
we
sha
find
him
in
barford
it
a
most
unlucky
thing
that
he
saw
us
go
to
last
evening
that
of
course
would
set
him
off
he
know
things
were
reaching
a
crisis
eldrick
and
collingwood
had
arranged
to
lunch
together
that
day
and
they
presently
went
off
asking
the
detective
to
keep
them
informed
of
events
but
up
to
three
o
they
heard
no
more
then
as
they
were
returning
along
the
street
byner
came
running
up
to
them
prydale
just
had
a
telephone
message
from
the
butler
at
normandale
he
exclaimed
pratt
is
there
and
something
extraordinary
is
going
on
the
butler
wants
the
police
we
off
at
once
there
prydale
in
a
motor
waiting
for
me
will
you
follow
he
darted
away
again
and
eldrick
looking
round
for
a
car
suddenly
recognized
the
mallathorpe
livery
great
scott
he
said
there
miss
mallathorpe
just
driving
in
better
tell
her
a
moment
later
he
and
collingwood
had
joined
nesta
in
her
carriage
and
the
horses
heads
were
turned
in
the
direction
towards
which
byner
and
prydale
were
already
hastening
chapter
xxvii
restored
to
energy
esther
mawson
leaving
pratt
to
enjoy
his
sherry
and
sandwiches
at
his
leisure
went
away
through
the
house
out
into
the
gardens
and
across
the
shrubbery
to
the
stables
the
coachman
and
grooms
were
at
dinner
with
the
exception
of
one
man
who
lived
in
a
cottage
at
the
entrance
to
the
this
was
the
very
man
she
wanted
to
see
and
she
found
him
in
the
and
beckoned
him
to
its
door
mallathorpe
wants
me
to
go
over
to
scaleby
on
an
errand
for
her
this
afternoon
she
said
can
you
have
the
ready
at
the
south
garden
gate
at
three
sharp
and
without
saying
anything
to
the
coachman
it
a
private
errand
of
late
this
particular
groom
had
received
several
commissions
of
this
sort
and
being
a
sharp
fellow
he
had
observed
that
they
were
generally
given
to
him
when
miss
mallathorpe
was
out
all
right
he
answered
the
young
missis
is
going
out
in
the
carriage
at
two
south
garden
gate
three
sharp
anybody
but
you
only
me
replied
esther
do
say
anything
to
anybody
about
where
we
going
get
the
ready
after
the
carriage
has
gone
the
groom
nodded
in
comprehension
and
esther
went
back
to
the
house
and
to
her
own
room
she
ought
at
that
time
of
day
to
have
been
eating
her
dinner
with
the
rest
of
the
upper
servants
but
she
had
work
to
do
which
was
of
much
more
importance
than
the
consumption
of
food
and
drink
there
was
going
to
be
a
flight
that
afternoon
but
it
would
not
be
pratt
who
would
undertake
it
esther
mawson
had
carefully
calculated
all
her
chances
as
soon
as
pratt
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
be
away
for
a
while
she
knew
that
pratt
would
not
have
left
barford
for
any
indefinite
period
unless
something
had
gone
seriously
wrong
but
she
knew
more
by
inference
and
intuition
if
pratt
was
going
away
rather
since
he
was
going
away
he
would
have
on
his
person
things
of
value
documents
money
she
meant
to
gain
possession
of
everything
that
he
had
she
meant
to
have
a
brief
interview
with
mallathorpe
then
she
meant
to
drive
to
scaleby
and
to
leave
that
part
of
the
country
just
as
thoroughly
and
completely
as
pratt
had
meant
to
leave
it
and
now
in
her
own
room
she
was
completing
her
preparations
there
was
little
to
do
she
knew
that
if
her
venture
came
off
successfully
she
could
easily
afford
to
leave
her
personal
possessions
behind
her
and
that
she
would
be
all
the
more
free
and
unrestricted
in
her
movements
if
she
departed
without
as
much
as
a
change
of
clothes
and
linen
and
so
by
two
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
a
neat
and
unobtrusive
travelling
costume
had
put
on
an
equally
neat
and
plain
hat
had
rolled
her
umbrella
and
laid
it
her
gloves
and
a
cloak
where
they
could
be
readily
picked
up
and
had
attached
to
her
slim
waist
a
by
means
of
a
steel
chain
which
she
secured
by
a
small
padlock
as
soon
as
she
had
arranged
it
to
her
satisfaction
she
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
leave
a
lying
about
in
a
railway
carriage
at
any
time
but
in
this
particular
instance
she
was
not
going
to
run
any
risk
of
even
a
moment
forgetfulness
everything
was
in
readiness
by
twenty
minutes
past
two
and
she
took
up
her
position
in
a
window
from
which
she
could
see
the
front
door
of
the
house
at
two
the
carriage
and
its
two
fine
bay
horses
came
round
from
the
stables
a
minute
or
two
later
nesta
mallathorpe
emerged
from
the
hall
yet
another
minute
and
the
carriage
was
whirling
down
the
park
in
the
direction
of
barford
and
then
esther
moved
from
the
window
picked
up
the
umbrella
the
cloak
the
gloves
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
the
room
wherein
she
had
left
pratt
no
one
ever
went
near
those
old
rooms
except
on
some
special
errand
or
business
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
all
around
her
as
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
slipped
inside
the
door
to
lock
it
again
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
there
was
an
equally
deep
silence
within
the
room
and
for
a
moment
she
glanced
a
little
fearfully
at
the
recumbent
figure
in
the
old
chair
pratt
had
stretched
himself
fully
in
his
easy
quarters
legs
lay
extended
across
the
his
head
and
shoulders
were
thrown
far
back
against
the
faded
tapestry
and
he
was
so
still
that
he
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
dead
but
esther
mawson
had
tried
the
effect
of
that
particular
drug
on
a
good
many
people
and
she
knew
that
the
victim
in
this
instance
was
merely
plunged
in
a
sleep
from
which
nothing
whatever
could
wake
him
yet
awhile
and
after
one
searching
glance
at
him
and
one
lifting
of
an
eyelid
by
a
practised
finger
she
went
rapidly
and
thoroughly
through
pratt
pockets
and
within
a
few
minutes
of
entering
the
room
had
cleared
them
of
everything
they
contained
the
sealed
packet
which
he
had
taken
from
his
safe
that
morning
the
which
murgatroyd
had
returned
in
her
indignant
letter
another
roll
of
notes
of
considerable
value
in
a
a
purse
containing
notes
and
gold
to
a
large
amount
all
those
she
laid
one
by
one
on
a
table
and
finally
and
as
calmly
as
if
she
were
sorting
linen
she
swept
gold
and
purse
into
her
bag
and
tore
open
the
sealed
envelope
there
were
five
documents
in
that
envelope
esther
examined
each
with
meticulous
care
the
first
was
an
authority
to
linford
pratt
to
sell
certain
shares
standing
in
the
name
of
ann
mallathorpe
the
second
was
a
similar
document
relating
to
other
shares
each
was
complete
save
for
ann
mallathorpe
signature
the
third
document
was
the
power
of
attorney
which
ann
mallathorpe
had
given
to
linford
pratt
the
fourth
the
letter
which
she
had
written
to
him
on
the
evening
before
the
fatal
accident
to
harper
and
the
fifth
was
john
mallathorpe
will
at
last
she
held
in
her
hand
the
of
foolscap
paper
of
which
mallathorpe
driven
to
distraction
and
knowing
that
she
would
get
no
sympathy
from
her
own
daughter
had
told
her
she
was
a
woman
of
a
quick
and
an
understanding
mind
and
she
had
read
the
will
through
and
grasped
its
significance
as
swiftly
as
her
eyes
ran
over
it
and
those
eyes
turned
to
the
unconscious
pratt
with
a
flash
of
contempt
she
at
any
rate
would
not
follow
his
foolish
example
and
play
for
too
high
a
stake
no
she
would
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
its
hottest
she
was
of
the
parrawhite
persuasion
better
far
better
one
good
bird
in
the
hand
than
a
score
of
possible
birds
in
the
bush
she
presently
restored
the
five
documents
to
the
stout
envelope
picked
up
her
other
belongings
and
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
pratt
left
the
room
she
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
took
it
away
with
her
and
now
she
went
straight
to
a
certain
which
mallathorpe
had
tenanted
by
day
ever
since
her
illness
the
final
and
most
important
stage
of
esther
venture
was
at
hand
mallathorpe
sat
at
an
open
window
wearily
gazing
out
on
the
park
ever
since
her
son
death
she
had
remained
in
a
more
or
less
torpid
condition
rarely
talking
to
any
person
except
esther
mawson
it
had
been
manifest
from
the
first
that
her
daughter
presence
distressed
and
irritated
her
and
by
the
doctor
advice
nesta
had
gone
to
her
as
little
as
possible
while
taking
every
care
to
guard
her
and
see
to
her
comfort
all
day
long
she
sat
brooding
and
only
esther
mawson
now
for
some
time
in
her
full
confidence
knew
that
her
brooding
was
rapidly
developing
into
a
monomania
mallathorpe
indeed
had
but
one
thought
in
her
mind
the
eventual
circumventing
of
pratt
and
the
destruction
of
john
mallathorpe
will
she
turned
slowly
as
the
maid
came
in
and
carefully
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
her
voice
was
irritable
and
querulous
as
she
at
once
began
to
complain
you
never
been
near
me
for
two
hours
she
said
your
dinner
time
was
over
long
since
i
might
have
been
wanting
all
sorts
of
things
for
aught
you
cared
i
had
something
else
to
do
for
you
retorted
esther
coming
close
to
her
mistress
listen
now
i
got
it
mallathorpe
attitude
and
manner
suddenly
changed
she
caught
sight
of
the
packet
of
papers
in
the
woman
hand
and
at
once
sprang
to
her
feet
white
and
trembling
instinctively
she
held
out
her
own
hands
and
moved
a
little
nearer
to
the
maid
and
esther
quickly
put
the
table
between
them
and
shook
her
head
no
no
she
exclaimed
no
handling
of
anything
yet
you
keep
your
hands
off
you
were
ready
enough
to
bargain
with
pratt
now
you
have
to
bargain
with
me
but
i
not
such
a
fool
as
he
was
i
take
cash
down
and
be
done
with
it
mallathorpe
rested
her
trembling
hands
on
the
table
and
bent
forward
across
it
is
it
is
it
really
the
will
she
whispered
hoarsely
instead
of
replying
in
words
esther
taking
care
to
keep
at
a
safe
distance
behind
the
table
and
with
the
door
only
a
yard
or
two
in
her
rear
drew
out
the
documents
one
by
one
and
held
them
up
the
will
she
said
your
letter
to
pratt
the
power
of
attorney
two
papers
that
he
brought
for
you
to
sign
that
the
lot
and
now
as
i
said
we
bargain
where
is
he
asked
mallathorpe
how
how
did
you
get
them
does
he
know
did
he
give
them
up
if
you
want
to
know
he
safe
and
sound
asleep
in
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
answered
esther
i
drugged
him
something
afoot
something
gone
wrong
with
his
schemes
at
barford
and
he
came
here
on
his
way
elsewhere
and
so
i
took
the
chance
now
then
what
are
you
going
to
give
me
mallathorpe
whose
nervous
agitation
was
becoming
more
and
more
marked
wrung
her
hands
i
nothing
to
give
she
cried
you
know
very
well
he
had
the
management
of
everything
i
do
know
how
things
are
stuff
exclaimed
esther
i
know
better
than
that
you
a
lot
of
ready
money
in
that
desk
there
you
know
you
drew
a
lot
out
of
the
bank
some
time
ago
and
it
there
now
you
kept
it
for
a
contingency
the
contingency
here
and
you
your
rings
the
diamond
and
ruby
rings
i
know
what
they
worth
come
on
now
i
mean
to
have
the
whole
lot
so
it
no
use
hesitating
mallathorpe
looked
at
the
maid
bold
and
resolute
eyes
and
then
at
the
papers
and
she
glanced
from
eyes
and
papers
to
a
bright
fire
which
burned
in
the
grate
close
by
you
give
everything
up
she
asked
nervously
put
those
that
you
got
in
your
desk
and
those
rings
that
are
in
your
on
the
table
between
us
answered
esther
and
i
hand
over
these
papers
on
the
instant
i
not
going
to
be
such
a
fool
as
to
keep
them
not
i
come
on
now
is
this
the
chance
wanted
mallathorpe
drew
a
small
bunch
of
keys
from
her
gown
and
went
over
to
the
desk
which
esther
had
pointed
to
within
a
minute
she
was
back
again
at
the
table
a
roll
of
bank
notes
in
one
hand
half
a
dozen
magnificent
rings
in
the
other
she
put
both
hands
halfway
across
and
unclasped
them
and
esther
mawson
with
a
light
laugh
threw
the
papers
over
the
table
and
hastily
swept
their
price
into
her
handbag
mallathorpe
nerves
suddenly
became
steady
with
a
deep
sigh
she
caught
up
the
various
documents
and
looked
them
quickly
and
thoroughly
over
then
she
tore
them
into
fragments
and
flung
the
fragments
in
the
fire
and
as
they
blazed
up
she
turned
and
looked
at
esther
mawson
in
a
way
which
made
esther
shrink
a
little
but
she
was
already
at
the
door
and
she
opened
it
and
walked
out
and
down
the
stair
she
was
across
the
hall
beneath
where
the
butler
and
one
of
the
footmen
were
idly
talking
when
a
sharp
cry
from
above
made
her
then
look
up
mallathorpe
suddenly
restored
to
life
and
energy
was
leaning
over
the
balustrade
stop
that
woman
you
men
she
said
seize
her
fasten
her
up
lock
the
door
wherever
you
put
her
she
stolen
my
rings
and
a
lot
of
money
out
of
my
desk
and
telephone
instantly
to
barford
and
tell
them
to
send
the
police
here
at
once
chapter
xxviii
the
woman
in
black
nesta
mallathorpe
who
had
just
arrived
in
barford
when
eldrick
caught
sight
of
her
was
seriously
startled
as
he
and
collingwood
came
running
up
to
her
carriage
the
solicitor
entered
it
without
ceremony
or
explanation
and
turning
to
the
coachman
bade
him
drive
back
to
normandale
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
horses
go
meanwhile
collingwood
turned
to
nesta
do
be
alarmed
he
said
something
is
happening
at
the
grange
your
mother
has
just
telephoned
to
the
police
here
to
go
there
at
once
there
they
are
in
front
of
us
in
that
car
did
my
mother
say
if
she
was
in
danger
demanded
nesta
she
ca
be
exclaimed
eldrick
turning
from
the
coachman
as
the
horses
were
whipped
round
and
the
carriage
moved
off
she
evidently
gave
orders
for
the
message
no
pratt
there
and
but
of
course
you
do
know
the
police
want
pratt
they
been
searching
for
him
since
noon
he
wanted
for
murder
do
frighten
miss
mallathorpe
said
collingwood
the
murder
has
nothing
to
do
with
present
events
he
went
on
reassuringly
something
that
happened
some
time
ago
do
be
afraid
about
your
mother
there
are
plenty
of
people
round
her
you
know
i
ca
help
feeling
anxious
if
pratt
is
there
she
answered
how
did
he
come
to
be
there
it
not
an
hour
since
i
left
home
this
is
all
some
of
esther
mawson
work
and
we
shall
have
to
wait
nearly
an
hour
before
we
know
what
is
going
on
it
all
uphill
work
to
normandale
and
the
horses
ca
do
it
in
the
time
eldrick
said
collingwood
as
the
carriage
came
abreast
of
the
central
station
and
a
long
line
of
motorcars
stop
the
coachman
let
get
one
of
those
cars
we
shall
get
to
normandale
twice
as
quickly
the
main
thing
is
to
relieve
miss
mallathorpe
of
anxiety
now
he
went
on
as
they
hastily
left
the
carriage
and
transferred
themselves
to
a
car
quickly
scented
by
eldrick
as
the
most
promising
of
the
lot
tell
the
driver
to
go
as
fast
as
he
can
the
other
car
not
very
far
in
front
tell
him
to
catch
it
up
eldrick
leaned
over
and
gave
his
orders
i
told
him
not
only
to
catch
him
up
but
to
get
in
front
of
he
said
settling
down
again
in
his
seat
this
is
a
better
car
than
theirs
and
we
shall
be
there
first
now
miss
mallathorpe
do
you
bother
this
is
probably
going
to
be
the
point
of
everything
one
feels
certain
at
any
rate
pratt
has
reached
the
end
of
his
tether
if
i
seem
to
bother
replied
nesta
it
because
i
know
that
he
and
esther
mawson
are
at
normandale
working
mischief
we
shall
be
there
in
half
an
hour
said
collingwood
as
their
own
car
ran
past
that
in
which
the
detectives
and
byner
were
seated
they
do
much
mischief
in
that
time
none
of
the
three
spoke
again
until
the
car
pulled
up
suddenly
at
the
gates
of
normandale
park
the
an
old
man
coming
out
to
open
them
approached
the
door
of
the
car
on
seeing
nesta
within
there
a
young
woman
just
gone
up
to
the
house
that
wants
to
see
you
very
particular
miss
he
said
i
tell
her
that
you
gone
to
barford
but
she
said
she
come
a
long
way
and
she
wait
till
you
come
back
she
going
across
the
park
there
crossin
yon
path
he
pointed
over
the
level
sward
to
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
in
black
who
was
obviously
taking
a
near
cut
up
to
the
grange
nesta
looked
wonderingly
across
the
park
as
the
car
cleared
the
gate
and
went
on
up
the
drive
who
can
she
be
she
said
musingly
a
woman
from
a
long
way
to
see
me
she
get
to
the
house
soon
after
we
reach
it
said
eldrick
attend
to
this
more
pressing
business
first
we
should
know
what
afoot
here
in
a
minute
or
two
but
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
make
out
or
to
discover
what
really
was
afoot
the
car
stopped
at
the
hall
door
the
second
car
came
close
behind
it
nesta
collingwood
eldrick
byner
and
the
detectives
poured
into
the
hall
encountered
a
much
butler
a
couple
of
footmen
and
the
groom
whose
services
esther
mawson
had
requisitioned
and
who
weary
of
waiting
for
her
had
come
up
to
the
house
what
all
this
asked
eldrick
taking
the
situation
into
his
own
hands
what
the
matter
why
did
you
send
for
the
police
mallathorpe
orders
sir
answered
the
butler
with
an
apologetic
glance
at
his
young
mistress
really
sir
i
know
exactly
what
is
the
matter
we
are
all
so
confused
what
happened
was
that
not
very
long
after
miss
mallathorpe
had
left
for
town
in
the
carriage
esther
mawson
the
maid
came
downstairs
from
mallathorpe
room
and
was
crossing
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
when
mallathorpe
suddenly
appeared
up
there
and
called
to
me
and
james
to
stop
her
and
lock
her
up
as
she
stolen
money
and
jewels
we
were
to
lock
her
up
and
telephone
for
the
police
sir
and
to
add
that
pratt
was
here
well
demanded
eldrick
we
did
lock
her
up
sir
she
in
my
pantry
continued
the
butler
ruefully
we
got
her
in
there
because
there
are
bars
to
the
windows
she
ca
get
out
of
that
a
terrible
time
we
had
too
sir
she
fought
us
like
like
a
maniac
protesting
all
the
time
that
mallathorpe
had
given
her
what
she
had
on
her
of
course
sir
we
do
know
what
she
may
have
on
her
we
simply
obeyed
mrs
mallathorpe
where
is
mrs
mallathorpe
asked
collingwood
is
she
safe
oh
quite
safe
sir
replied
the
butler
she
returned
to
her
room
after
giving
those
orders
mallathorpe
appeared
to
be
quite
calm
sir
prydale
pushed
himself
forward
unceremoniously
and
insistently
keep
that
woman
locked
up
he
said
first
of
all
where
pratt
mallathorpe
said
he
would
be
found
in
a
room
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
answered
the
butler
shaking
his
head
as
if
he
were
thoroughly
mystified
she
said
you
would
find
him
fast
asleep
mawson
had
drugged
him
prydale
looked
at
byner
and
at
his
then
he
turned
to
the
butler
come
on
he
said
brusquely
take
us
there
at
once
he
glanced
at
eldrick
i
beginning
to
see
through
it
mr
eldrick
he
whispered
this
maid
caught
pratt
for
us
let
hope
he
still
but
before
he
could
say
more
and
just
as
the
butler
opened
a
door
which
led
into
a
corridor
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
a
sharp
crack
which
was
unmistakably
that
of
a
revolver
rang
through
the
house
waking
equally
sharp
echoes
in
the
silent
room
and
at
that
nesta
hurried
up
the
stairway
to
her
mother
apartment
and
the
men
after
a
hurried
glance
at
each
other
ran
along
the
corridor
after
the
butler
and
the
footmen
pratt
came
out
of
his
stupor
much
sooner
than
esther
mawson
had
reckoned
on
according
to
her
previous
experiments
with
the
particular
drug
which
she
had
administered
to
him
he
ought
to
have
remained
in
a
profound
and
an
undisturbed
slumber
until
at
least
five
but
he
woke
at
four
woke
suddenly
sharply
only
conscious
at
first
of
a
terrible
pain
in
his
head
which
kept
him
groaning
and
moaning
in
his
chair
for
a
minute
or
two
before
he
fairly
realized
where
he
was
and
what
had
happened
as
the
pain
became
milder
and
gave
way
to
a
dull
throbbing
and
a
general
sense
of
discomfort
he
looked
round
out
of
aching
eyes
and
saw
the
bottle
of
sherry
and
so
dull
were
his
wits
that
his
only
thought
at
first
was
that
the
wine
had
been
far
stronger
than
he
had
known
and
that
he
had
drunk
far
too
much
of
it
and
that
it
had
sent
him
to
sleep
and
just
then
his
wandering
glance
fell
on
some
papers
which
esther
mawson
had
taken
from
one
of
his
pockets
and
thrown
aside
as
of
no
value
he
leapt
to
his
feet
trembling
and
sweating
his
hands
shaking
as
if
smitten
with
a
sudden
palsy
went
to
his
pockets
he
tore
off
his
coat
and
turned
his
pockets
out
as
if
touch
and
feeling
were
not
to
be
believed
and
his
eyes
must
see
that
there
was
really
nothing
there
then
he
snatched
up
the
papers
on
the
floor
and
found
nothing
but
letters
and
odd
scraps
of
unimportant
memoranda
he
stamped
his
feet
on
those
things
and
began
to
swear
and
curse
and
finally
to
sob
and
whine
the
shock
of
his
discovery
had
driven
all
his
stupefaction
away
by
that
time
and
he
knew
what
had
happened
and
his
whining
and
sobbing
was
not
that
of
despair
but
the
far
worse
and
fiercer
sobbing
and
whining
of
rage
and
terrible
anger
if
the
woman
who
had
tricked
him
had
been
there
he
would
have
torn
her
limb
from
limb
and
have
glutted
himself
with
revenge
but
he
was
alone
and
presently
after
moving
around
his
prison
more
like
a
wild
beast
than
a
human
being
his
senses
having
deserted
him
for
a
while
he
regained
some
composure
and
glanced
about
him
for
means
of
escape
he
went
to
the
door
and
tried
it
but
the
old
substantial
oak
stood
firm
and
fast
nothing
but
a
would
break
that
door
and
so
he
turned
to
the
mullioned
window
set
in
a
deep
recess
he
knew
that
it
was
thirty
or
forty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
but
there
was
much
thick
ivy
growing
on
the
walls
of
normandale
grange
and
it
might
be
possible
to
climb
down
by
its
aid
with
a
great
effort
he
forced
open
one
of
the
sashes
and
looked
out
and
in
the
same
instant
he
drew
in
his
head
with
a
harsh
groan
the
window
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
hall
door
and
he
had
seen
prydale
and
two
other
detectives
and
the
stranger
from
london
whom
he
believed
to
be
a
detective
hurrying
from
their
motorcar
into
the
house
there
was
but
one
thing
for
it
now
esther
mawson
had
robbed
him
of
everything
that
was
on
him
in
the
way
of
papers
and
money
but
in
his
she
had
left
a
revolver
which
pratt
had
carried
always
loaded
for
some
time
and
now
without
the
least
hesitation
he
drew
it
out
and
sent
one
of
its
bullets
through
his
brain
eldrick
and
collingwood
returning
to
the
hall
from
the
room
in
which
they
and
the
detectives
had
found
pratt
dead
body
stood
a
little
later
in
earnest
conversation
with
prydale
who
had
just
come
there
from
an
interview
with
esther
mawson
nesta
mallathorpe
suddenly
called
to
them
from
the
stairs
at
the
same
time
beckoning
them
to
go
up
to
her
will
you
come
with
me
and
speak
to
my
mother
she
said
she
knows
you
are
here
and
she
wants
to
say
something
about
what
has
happened
something
about
that
document
which
pratt
said
he
possessed
eldrick
and
collingwood
exchanged
glances
without
speaking
they
followed
nesta
into
her
mother
and
instead
of
the
whom
they
had
expected
to
find
there
they
saw
a
woman
who
had
evidently
regained
not
only
her
vivacity
and
her
spirits
but
her
sense
of
authority
and
her
inclination
to
exercise
it
i
am
sorry
that
you
gentlemen
should
have
been
drawn
into
all
this
wretched
business
she
exclaimed
as
she
pointed
the
two
men
to
chairs
everything
must
seem
very
strange
and
indeed
have
seemed
so
for
some
time
but
i
have
been
the
victim
of
as
bad
a
scoundrel
as
ever
lived
i
not
going
to
be
so
hypocritical
as
to
pretend
that
i
sorry
he
dead
i
not
i
only
wish
he
met
his
proper
fate
on
the
scaffold
i
do
know
what
you
may
have
heard
or
gathered
my
daughter
herself
from
what
she
tells
me
has
only
the
vaguest
notions
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
eldrick
and
you
collingwood
seeing
that
you
one
a
solicitor
and
the
other
a
barrister
that
pratt
invented
a
most
abominable
plot
against
me
which
of
course
has
a
word
of
truth
in
it
yet
was
so
clever
that
eldrick
suddenly
raised
his
hand
mrs
mallathorpe
he
said
quietly
i
think
you
had
better
let
me
speak
before
you
go
any
further
perhaps
we
collingwood
and
i
know
more
than
you
think
do
trifle
mallathorpe
for
your
own
and
your
daughter
sake
tell
the
truth
and
answer
a
plain
question
which
i
assure
you
is
asked
in
your
own
interest
what
have
you
done
with
john
mallathorpe
will
collingwood
anxious
for
nesta
was
watching
her
closely
and
now
he
saw
her
turn
a
startled
and
inquiring
look
on
her
mother
who
in
her
turn
dashed
a
surprised
glance
at
eldrick
but
if
mallathorpe
was
surprised
she
was
also
indignant
or
she
simulated
indignation
and
she
replied
to
the
solicitor
question
with
a
sharp
retort
what
do
you
mean
john
mallathorpe
will
she
exclaimed
what
do
i
know
of
john
mallathorpe
will
there
never
was
mrs
mallathorpe
interrupted
eldrick
do
i
speaking
in
your
interest
i
tell
you
there
was
a
will
it
was
made
on
the
morning
of
john
mallathorpe
death
it
was
found
by
collingwood
late
grandfather
antony
bartle
when
he
died
suddenly
in
my
office
it
fell
into
pratt
hands
that
is
the
document
which
pratt
held
over
you
and
not
an
hour
ago
esther
mawson
took
it
from
pratt
and
she
gave
it
to
you
again
i
ask
you
what
have
you
done
with
it
mallathorpe
hesitated
a
moment
then
she
suddenly
faced
eldrick
with
a
defiant
look
let
them
let
everybody
do
what
they
like
she
exclaimed
it
burnt
i
threw
it
in
that
fire
as
soon
as
i
got
it
and
now
nesta
interrupted
her
mother
does
any
one
know
the
terms
of
that
will
she
asked
looking
at
eldrick
tell
me
if
you
know
hush
she
went
on
as
mallathorpe
tried
to
speak
again
i
will
know
yes
answered
eldrick
esther
mawson
knows
them
she
read
the
will
carefully
she
told
prydale
just
now
what
they
were
with
the
exception
of
three
legacies
of
ten
thousand
pounds
each
to
your
mother
your
brother
and
yourself
john
mallathorpe
left
everything
he
possessed
to
the
town
of
barford
for
an
educational
trust
then
asked
nesta
quietly
as
she
made
a
peremptory
sign
to
her
mother
to
be
silent
we
never
had
any
right
to
be
here
at
all
i
afraid
not
replied
eldrick
then
of
course
we
shall
go
said
nesta
that
certain
do
you
hear
that
mother
that
my
decision
it
final
you
can
do
what
you
like
retorted
mallathorpe
sullenly
i
am
not
going
to
be
frightened
by
anything
that
esther
mawson
says
nor
by
what
you
say
she
continued
turning
on
eldrick
all
that
has
got
to
be
proved
who
can
prove
it
what
can
prove
it
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
give
up
my
rights
without
fighting
for
them
i
shall
swear
that
every
word
of
esther
mawson
is
a
lie
no
one
can
bring
forward
a
will
that
does
exist
and
what
concern
is
it
of
yours
eldrick
what
right
have
you
you
are
quite
right
mallathorpe
said
eldrick
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
so
he
turned
to
the
door
and
as
he
turned
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
old
butler
who
looked
apologetically
but
earnestly
at
nesta
as
he
stepped
forward
a
gaukrodger
wishes
to
see
you
on
very
particular
business
he
murmured
she
been
waiting
some
little
time
something
she
says
about
some
papers
she
has
just
found
belonging
to
the
late
john
mallathorpe
collingwood
who
was
standing
close
to
nesta
caught
all
the
butler
said
gaukrodger
he
exclaimed
with
a
quick
glance
at
eldrick
that
was
the
name
of
the
manager
a
witness
see
the
woman
at
once
he
whispered
to
nesta
bring
gaukrodger
in
dickenson
said
nesta
stay
i
come
with
you
and
bring
her
in
myself
she
returned
a
moment
later
with
a
slightly
built
rather
careworn
woman
dressed
in
deep
mourning
the
woman
in
black
whom
they
had
seen
crossing
the
park
who
looked
nervously
round
her
as
she
entered
what
is
it
you
have
for
me
mrs
gaukrodger
asked
nesta
papers
belonging
to
the
late
john
mallathorpe
how
where
did
you
get
them
gaukrodger
drew
a
large
envelope
from
under
her
cloak
this
miss
she
answered
one
paper
i
only
found
it
this
morning
in
this
way
she
went
on
addressing
herself
to
nesta
when
my
husband
was
killed
along
with
john
mallathorpe
they
of
course
brought
home
the
clothes
he
was
wearing
there
were
a
lot
of
papers
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
two
pockets
full
of
them
and
i
had
heart
or
courage
to
look
at
them
at
that
time
miss
i
could
and
i
locked
them
up
in
a
box
i
never
looked
at
them
until
this
very
day
but
this
morning
i
happened
to
open
that
box
and
i
saw
them
and
i
thought
i
see
what
they
were
and
this
was
one
you
see
it
in
a
plain
envelope
it
was
sealed
but
there
no
writing
on
it
i
cut
the
envelope
open
and
drew
the
paper
out
and
i
saw
at
once
it
was
john
mallathorpe
will
so
i
came
straight
to
you
with
it
she
handed
the
envelope
over
to
nesta
who
at
once
gave
it
to
eldrick
the
solicitor
hastily
drew
out
the
enclosure
glanced
it
over
and
turned
sharply
to
collingwood
with
a
muttered
exclamation
good
gracious
he
said
that
man
cobcroft
was
right
there
a
duplicate
and
here
it
is
mallathorpe
had
come
nearer
the
sight
of
the
half
sheet
of
foolscap
in
eldrick
hands
seemed
to
fascinate
her
and
the
expression
of
her
face
as
she
came
close
to
his
side
was
so
curious
that
the
solicitor
involuntarily
folded
up
the
will
and
hastily
put
it
behind
his
back
he
had
not
only
seen
that
expression
but
had
caught
sight
of
mallathorpe
twitching
fingers
is
that
that
another
will
she
whispered
john
mallathorpe
precisely
the
same
another
copy
duly
signed
and
witnessed
answered
eldrick
firmly
what
you
foolishly
did
was
done
for
nothing
and
the
most
fortunate
thing
in
the
world
mallathorpe
that
this
has
turned
up
most
fortunate
for
you
mallathorpe
steadied
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
looked
at
him
fixedly
everything
have
to
be
given
up
she
asked
the
terms
of
this
will
will
be
carried
out
answered
eldrick
will
will
they
make
me
give
up
what
we
saved
she
whispered
mother
said
nesta
appealingly
do
come
away
somewhere
and
let
me
talk
to
you
come
but
mallathorpe
shook
off
her
daughter
hand
and
turned
again
to
eldrick
will
they
she
demanded
answer
i
do
think
you
find
the
trustees
at
all
hard
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
account
answered
eldrick
they
probably
take
matters
over
from
now
and
ignore
anything
that
happened
during
the
past
two
years
again
nesta
tried
to
lead
her
mother
away
and
again
mallathorpe
pushed
the
appealing
hand
from
her
all
her
attention
was
fixed
on
eldrick
and
and
will
the
police
give
me
now
what
they
found
on
that
woman
she
whispered
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
replied
eldrick
it
yours
mallathorpe
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
she
looked
at
the
solicitor
steadily
for
a
moment
then
without
another
word
she
turned
and
went
away
to
find
prydale
eldrick
turned
to
nesta
do
forget
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
a
terrible
blow
to
her
and
she
been
thinking
of
your
interests
leave
her
alone
for
a
while
she
get
used
to
the
altered
circumstances
i
sorry
for
her
and
for
you
but
nesta
made
a
sign
of
dissent
there
no
need
to
be
sorry
for
me
eldrick
she
answered
it
a
greater
relief
than
you
can
realize
she
turned
from
him
and
went
over
to
gaukrodger
who
had
watched
this
scene
without
fully
comprehending
it
come
with
me
she
said
you
look
very
tired
and
you
must
have
some
tea
and
rest
awhile
come
now
eldrick
and
collingwood
left
alone
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
the
solicitor
shook
his
head
expressively
well
that
over
he
exclaimed
i
must
go
back
and
hand
this
will
over
to
the
two
trustees
but
you
collingwood
stay
here
a
bit
if
ever
that
girl
needs
company
and
help
it
now
i
stopping
said
collingwood
he
remained
for
a
time
where
eldrick
left
him
at
last
he
went
down
to
the
hall
and
out
into
the
gardens
and
presently
nesta
came
to
him
there
and
as
if
with
a
mutual
understanding
they
walked
away
into
the
nearer
stretches
of
the
park
normandale
had
never
looked
more
beautiful
than
it
did
that
afternoon
and
in
the
midst
of
a
silence
which
up
to
then
neither
of
them
had
cared
to
break
collingwood
suddenly
turned
to
the
girl
who
had
just
lost
it
are
you
sure
that
you
wo
miss
all
this
greatly
he
asked
just
think
i
rather
lose
more
than
this
however
fond
i
got
of
it
than
go
through
what
i
gone
through
lately
she
answered
frankly
do
you
know
what
i
want
to
do
no
i
think
not
he
said
what
if
it
possible
to
forget
all
about
this
she
replied
and
if
that
also
possible
to
help
my
mother
to
forget
too
do
think
too
hardly
of
her
i
do
suppose
any
of
us
know
how
much
all
this
place
and
the
money
meant
to
her
i
got
no
hard
thoughts
about
her
said
collingwood
i
sorry
for
her
but
is
it
too
soon
to
talk
about
the
future
nesta
looked
at
him
in
a
way
which
showed
him
that
she
only
half
comprehended
the
question
but
there
was
sufficient
comprehension
in
her
eyes
to
warrant
him
in
taking
her
hands
in
his
you
know
why
i
did
go
to
india
he
said
bending
his
face
to
hers
i
guessed
she
answered
shyly
then
collingwood
at
this
suddenly
arrived
supreme
moment
became
curiously
bereft
of
speech
and
after
a
period
of
silence
during
which
being
in
the
shadow
of
a
grove
of
which
kindly
concealed
them
from
the
rest
of
the
world
they
held
each
other
hands
all
that
he
could
find
to
say
was
one
word
well
nesta
laughed
well
what
she
whispered
collingwood
suddenly
laughed
too
and
put
his
arm
round
her
it
no
good
he
said
i
often
thought
of
what
i
to
say
to
you
and
now
i
forgotten
all
shall
i
say
it
all
at
once
would
it
be
best
she
murmured
with
another
laugh
then
you
going
to
marry
me
he
asked
am
i
to
answer
all
at
once
she
said
one
word
will
do
he
exclaimed
drawing
her
to
him
ah
she
whispered
as
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
i
could
say
it
all
in
one
word
but
we
lots
of
time
before
us
the
end
