renascence
all
i
could
see
from
where
i
stood
interim
the
room
is
full
of
you
as
i
came
in
the
suicide
curse
thee
life
i
will
live
with
thee
no
more
god
world
o
world
i
can
not
hold
thee
close
enough
afternoon
on
a
hill
i
will
be
the
gladdest
thing
sorrow
sorrow
like
a
ceaseless
rain
tavern
i
keep
a
little
tavern
ashes
of
life
love
has
gone
and
left
me
and
the
days
are
all
alike
the
little
ghost
i
knew
her
for
a
little
ghost
kin
to
sorrow
am
i
kin
to
sorrow
three
songs
of
shattering
i
the
first
rose
on
my
ii
let
the
little
birds
sing
iii
all
the
blossoms
are
underneath
the
tree
the
shroud
death
i
say
my
heart
is
bowed
the
dream
love
if
i
weep
it
will
not
matter
indifference
i
said
for
love
was
laggard
o
love
was
slow
to
come
she
is
neither
pink
nor
pale
blight
hard
seeds
of
hate
i
planted
when
the
year
grows
old
i
can
not
but
remember
sonnets
i
thou
art
not
lovelier
than
lilacs
no
ii
time
does
not
bring
relief
you
all
have
lied
iii
mindful
of
you
the
sodden
earth
in
spring
iv
not
in
this
chamber
only
at
my
birth

quite
casual
way

might

open

renascence
all
i
could
see
from
where
i
stood
was
three
long
mountains
and
a
wood
i
turned
and
looked
another
way
and
saw
three
islands
in
a
bay
so
with
my
eyes
i
traced
the
line
of
the
horizon
thin
and
fine
straight
around
till
i
was
come
back
to
where
i
started
from
and
all
i
saw
from
where
i
stood
was
three
long
mountains
and
a
wood
over
these
things
i
could
not
see
these
were
the
things
that
bounded
me
and
i
could
touch
them
with
my
hand
almost
i
thought
from
where
i
stand
and
all
at
once
things
seemed
so
small
my
breath
came
short
and
scarce
at
all
but
sure
the
sky
is
big
i
said
miles
and
miles
above
my
head
so
here
upon
my
back
i
lie
and
look
my
fill
into
the
sky
and
so
i
looked
and
after
all
the
sky
was
not
so
very
tall
the
sky
i
said
must
somewhere
stop
and
sure
enough
i
see
the
top
the
sky
i
thought
is
not
so
grand
i
could
touch
it
with
my
hand
and
reaching
up
my
hand
to
try
i
screamed
to
feel
it
touch
the
sky
i
screamed
and
lo
infinity
came
down
and
settled
over
me
forced
back
my
scream
into
my
chest
bent
back
my
arm
upon
my
breast
and
pressing
of
the
undefined
the
definition
on
my
mind
held
up
before
my
eyes
a
glass
through
which
my
shrinking
sight
did
pass
until
it
seemed
i
must
behold
immensity
made
manifold
whispered
to
me
a
word
whose
sound
deafened
the
air
for
worlds
around
and
brought
unmuffled
to
my
ears
the
gossiping
of
friendly
spheres
the
creaking
of
the
tented
sky
the
ticking
of
eternity
i
saw
and
heard
and
knew
at
last
the
how
and
why
of
all
things
past
and
present
and
forevermore
the
universe
cleft
to
the
core
lay
open
to
my
probing
sense
that
i
would
fain
pluck
thence
but
could
not
nay
but
needs
must
suck
at
the
great
wound
and
could
not
pluck
my
lips
away
till
i
had
drawn
all
venom
ah
fearful
pawn
for
my
omniscience
paid
i
toll
in
infinite
remorse
of
soul
all
sin
was
of
my
sinning
all
atoning
mine
and
mine
the
gall
of
all
regret
mine
was
the
weight
of
every
brooded
wrong
the
hate
that
stood
behind
each
envious
thrust
mine
every
greed
mine
every
lust
and
all
the
while
for
every
grief
each
suffering
i
craved
relief
with
individual
desire
craved
all
in
vain
and
felt
fierce
fire
about
a
thousand
people
crawl
perished
with
each
then
mourned
for
all
a
man
was
starving
in
capri
he
moved
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
i
felt
his
gaze
i
heard
his
moan
and
knew
his
hunger
as
my
own
i
saw
at
sea
a
great
fog
bank
between
two
ships
that
struck
and
sank
a
thousand
screams
the
heavens
smote
and
every
scream
tore
through
my
throat
no
hurt
i
did
not
feel
no
death
that
was
not
mine
mine
each
last
breath
that
crying
met
an
answering
cry
from
the
compassion
that
was
i
all
suffering
mine
and
mine
its
rod
mine
pity
like
the
pity
of
god
ah
awful
weight
infinity
pressed
down
upon
the
finite
me
my
anguished
spirit
like
a
bird
beating
against
my
lips
i
heard
yet
lay
the
weight
so
close
about
there
was
no
room
for
it
without
and
so
beneath
the
weight
lay
i
and
suffered
death
but
could
not
die
long
had
i
lain
thus
craving
death
when
quietly
the
earth
beneath
gave
way
and
inch
by
inch
so
great
at
last
had
grown
the
crushing
weight
into
the
earth
i
sank
till
i
full
six
feet
under
ground
did
lie
and
sank
no
more
there
is
no
weight
can
follow
here
however
great
from
off
my
breast
i
felt
it
roll
and
as
it
went
my
tortured
soul
burst
forth
and
fled
in
such
a
gust
that
all
about
me
swirled
the
dust
deep
in
the
earth
i
rested
now
cool
is
its
hand
upon
the
brow
and
soft
its
breast
beneath
the
head
of
one
who
is
so
gladly
dead
and
all
at
once
and
over
all
the
pitying
rain
began
to
fall
i
lay
and
heard
each
pattering
hoof
upon
my
lowly
thatched
roof
and
seemed
to
love
the
sound
far
more
than
ever
i
had
done
before
for
rain
it
hath
a
friendly
sound
to
one
who
six
feet
underground
and
scarce
the
friendly
voice
or
face
a
grave
is
such
a
quiet
place
the
rain
i
said
is
kind
to
come
and
speak
to
me
in
my
new
home
i
would
i
were
alive
again
to
kiss
the
fingers
of
the
rain
to
drink
into
my
eyes
the
shine
of
every
slanting
silver
line
to
catch
the
freshened
fragrant
breeze
from
drenched
and
dripping
for
soon
the
shower
will
be
done
and
then
the
broad
face
of
the
sun
will
laugh
above
the
earth
until
the
world
with
answering
mirth
shakes
joyously
and
each
round
drop
rolls
twinkling
from
its
top
how
can
i
bear
it
buried
here
while
overhead
the
sky
grows
clear
and
blue
again
after
the
storm
o
multiform
beloved
beauty
over
me
that
i
shall
never
never
see
again
that
i
shall
never
more
behold
sleeping
your
myriad
magics
through
away
from
you
o
god
i
cried
give
me
new
birth
and
put
me
back
upon
the
earth
upset
each
cloud
gigantic
gourd
and
let
the
heavy
rain
in
one
big
torrent
set
me
free
washing
my
grave
away
from
me
i
ceased
and
through
the
breathless
hush
that
answered
me
the
rush
of
herald
wings
came
whispering
like
music
down
the
vibrant
string
of
my
ascending
prayer
and
crash
before
the
wild
wind
whistling
lash
the
startled
reared
on
high
and
plunged
in
terror
down
the
sky
and
the
big
rain
in
one
black
wave
fell
from
the
sky
and
struck
my
grave
i
know
not
how
such
things
can
be
i
only
know
there
came
to
me
a
fragrance
such
as
never
clings
to
aught
save
happy
living
things
a
sound
as
of
some
joyous
elf
singing
sweet
songs
to
please
himself
and
through
and
over
everything
a
sense
of
glad
awakening
the
grass
at
my
ear
whispering
to
me
i
could
hear
i
felt
the
rain
cool
brushed
tenderly
across
my
lips
laid
gently
on
my
sealed
sight
and
all
at
once
the
heavy
night
fell
from
my
eyes
and
i
could
see
a
drenched
and
dripping
a
last
long
line
of
silver
rain
a
sky
grown
clear
and
blue
again
and
as
i
looked
a
quickening
gust
of
wind
blew
up
to
me
and
thrust
into
my
face
a
miracle
of
and
with
the
smell
i
know
not
how
such
things
can
be
i
breathed
my
soul
back
into
me
ah
up
then
from
the
ground
sprang
i
and
hailed
the
earth
with
such
a
cry
as
is
not
heard
save
from
a
man
who
has
been
dead
and
lives
again
about
the
trees
my
arms
i
wound
like
one
gone
mad
i
hugged
the
ground
i
raised
my
quivering
arms
on
high
i
laughed
and
laughed
into
the
sky
till
at
my
throat
a
strangling
sob
caught
fiercely
and
a
great
sent
instant
tears
into
my
eyes
o
god
i
cried
no
dark
disguise
can
hereafter
hide
from
me
thy
radiant
identity
thou
canst
not
move
across
the
grass
but
my
quick
eyes
will
see
thee
pass
nor
speak
however
silently
but
my
hushed
voice
will
answer
thee
i
know
the
path
that
tells
thy
way
through
the
cool
eve
of
every
day
god
i
can
push
the
grass
apart
and
lay
my
finger
on
thy
heart
the
world
stands
out
on
either
side
no
wider
than
the
heart
is
wide
above
the
world
is
stretched
the
sky
no
higher
than
the
soul
is
high
the
heart
can
push
the
sea
and
land
farther
away
on
either
hand
the
soul
can
split
the
sky
in
two
and
let
the
face
of
god
shine
through
but
east
and
west
will
pinch
the
heart
that
can
not
keep
them
pushed
apart
and
he
whose
soul
is
flat
the
sky
will
cave
in
on
him
by
and
by
interim
the
room
is
full
of
you
as
i
came
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
all
at
once
a
something
in
the
air
intangible
yet
stiff
with
meaning
struck
my
senses
sick
sharp
unfamiliar
odors
have
destroyed
each
other
room
dear
personality
the
heavy
scent
of
damp
funereal
flowers
the
very
essence
of
death
has
strangled
that
habitual
breath
of
home
whose
expiration
leaves
all
houses
dead
and
i
look
is
hideous
change
save
here
here
was
as
if
a
gate
had
opened
at
my
touch
and
i
had
stepped
into
some
enchanted
strange
sweet
garden
of
a
thousand
years
ago
and
suddenly
thought
i
have
been
here
before
you
are
not
here
i
know
that
you
are
gone
and
will
not
ever
enter
here
again
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
if
i
should
speak
your
silent
step
must
wake
across
the
hall
if
i
should
turn
my
head
that
your
sweet
eyes
would
kiss
me
from
the
so
short
a
time
to
teach
my
life
its
transposition
to
this
difficult
and
unaccustomed
key
the
room
is
as
you
left
it
your
last
touch
a
thoughtless
pressure
knowing
not
itself
as
saintly
hallows
now
each
simple
thing
hallows
and
glorifies
and
glows
between
the
dust
grey
fingers
like
a
shielded
light
there
is
your
book
just
as
you
laid
it
down
face
to
the
table
i
can
not
believe
that
you
are
gone
just
then
it
seemed
to
me
you
must
be
here
i
almost
laughed
to
think
how
like
reality
the
dream
had
been
yet
knew
before
i
laughed
and
so
was
still
that
book
outspread
just
as
you
laid
it
down
perhaps
you
thought
i
wonder
what
comes
next
and
whether
this
or
this
will
be
the
end
so
rose
and
left
it
thinking
to
return
perhaps
that
chair
when
you
arose
and
passed
out
of
the
room
rocked
silently
a
while
ere
it
again
was
still
when
you
were
gone
forever
from
the
room
perhaps
that
chair
stirred
by
your
movement
rocked
a
little
while
silently
to
and
fro
and
here
are
the
last
words
your
fingers
wrote
scrawled
in
broad
characters
across
a
page
in
this
brown
book
i
gave
you
here
your
hand
guiding
your
rapid
pen
moved
up
and
down
here
with
a
looping
knot
you
crossed
a
t
and
here
another
like
it
just
beyond
these
two
eccentric
e
you
were
so
small
and
wrote
so
brave
a
hand
how
strange
it
seems
that
of
all
words
these
are
the
words
you
chose
and
yet
a
simple
choice
you
did
not
know
you
would
not
write
again
if
you
had
known
but
then
it
does
not
matter
and
indeed
if
you
had
known
there
was
so
little
time
you
would
have
dropped
your
pen
and
come
to
me
and
this
page
would
be
empty
and
some
phrase
other
than
this
would
hold
my
wonder
now
yet
since
you
could
not
know
and
it
befell
that
these
are
the
last
words
your
fingers
wrote
there
is
a
dignity
some
might
not
see
in
this
i
picked
the
first
was
there
an
opening
bud
beside
it
you
left
until
o
my
love
the
things
that
withered
and
you
came
not
back
that
day
you
filled
this
circle
of
my
arms
that
now
is
empty
o
my
empty
life
that
day
that
day
you
picked
the
first
and
brought
it
in
to
show
me
i
recall
with
terrible
distinctness
how
the
smell
of
your
cool
gardens
drifted
in
with
you
i
know
you
held
it
up
for
me
to
see
and
flushed
because
i
looked
not
at
the
flower
but
at
your
face
and
when
behind
my
look
you
saw
such
unmistakable
intent
you
laughed
and
brushed
your
flower
against
my
lips
you
were
the
fairest
thing
god
ever
made
i
think
and
then
your
hands
above
my
heart
drew
down
its
stem
into
a
fastening
and
while
your
head
was
bent
i
kissed
your
hair
i
wonder
if
you
knew
beloved
hands
somehow
i
can
not
seem
to
see
them
still
somehow
i
can
not
seem
to
see
the
dust
in
your
bright
hair
what
is
the
need
of
heaven
when
earth
can
be
so
sweet
if
only
god
had
let
us
love
and
show
the
world
the
way
strange
cancellings
must
ink
th
eternal
books
when
will
bring
the
answer
right
that
first
i
wonder
where
it
is
it
seems
to
me
i
laid
it
down
somewhere
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
i
am
not
sure
even
if
it
was
white
or
pink
for
then
was
much
like
any
other
flower
to
me
save
that
it
was
the
first
i
did
not
know
then
that
it
was
the
last
if
i
had
known
but
then
it
does
not
matter
strange
how
few
after
all
said
and
done
the
things
that
are
of
moment
few
indeed
when
i
can
make
of
ten
small
words
a
rope
to
hang
the
world
i
had
you
and
i
have
you
now
no
more
there
there
it
dangles
where
the
little
truth
that
can
for
long
keep
footing
under
that
when
its
slack
syllables
tighten
to
a
thought
here
let
me
write
it
down
i
wish
to
see
just
how
a
thing
like
that
will
look
on
paper
had
you
and
i
have
you
now
no
o
little
words
how
can
you
run
so
straight
across
the
page
beneath
the
weight
you
bear
how
can
you
fall
apart
whom
such
a
theme
has
bound
together
and
hereafter
aid
in
trivial
expression
that
have
been
so
hideously
dignified
would
god
that
tearing
you
apart
would
tear
the
thread
i
strung
you
on
would
god
o
god
my
mind
stretches
asunder
on
this
merciless
rack
of
imagery
o
let
me
sleep
a
while
would
i
could
sleep
and
wake
to
find
me
back
in
that
sweet
summer
afternoon
with
you
summer
is
summer
still
by
the
calendar
how
easily
could
god
if
he
so
willed
set
back
the
world
a
little
turn
or
two
correct
its
griefs
and
bring
its
joys
again
we
were
so
wholly
one
i
had
not
thought
that
we
could
die
apart
i
had
not
thought
that
i
could
move
and
you
be
stiff
and
still
that
i
could
speak
and
you
perforce
be
dumb
i
think
our
were
like
warp
and
woof
in
some
firm
fabric
woven
in
and
out
your
golden
filaments
in
fair
design
across
my
duller
fibre
and
the
shining
strip
is
rent
the
exquisite
fine
pattern
is
destroyed
part
of
your
heart
aches
in
my
breast
part
of
my
heart
lies
chilled
in
the
damp
earth
with
you
i
have
been
torn
in
two
and
suffer
for
the
rest
of
me
what
is
my
life
to
me
and
what
am
i
to
life
a
ship
whose
star
has
guttered
out
a
fear
that
in
the
deep
night
starts
awake
perpetually
to
find
its
senses
strained
against
the
taut
strings
of
the
quivering
air
awaiting
the
return
of
some
dread
chord
dark
dark
is
all
i
find
for
metaphor
all
else
were
contrast
save
that
contrast
wall
is
down
and
all
opposed
things
flow
together
into
a
vast
monotony
where
night
and
day
and
frost
and
thaw
and
death
and
life
are
synonyms
what
now
what
now
to
me
are
all
the
jabbering
birds
and
foolish
flowers
that
clutter
up
the
world
you
were
my
song
now
let
discord
scream
you
were
my
flower
now
let
the
world
grow
weeds
for
i
shall
not
plant
things
above
your
grave
the
common
balm
of
the
conventional
woe
for
its
own
wound
amid
sensations
rendered
negative
by
your
elimination
stands
certain
unmixed
the
element
of
grief
i
sorrow
and
i
shall
not
mock
my
truth
with
travesties
of
suffering
nor
seek
to
effigy
its
incorporeal
bulk
in
little
images
of
woe
i
can
not
call
you
back
and
i
desire
no
utterance
of
my
immaterial
voice
i
can
not
even
turn
my
face
this
way
or
that
and
say
my
face
is
turned
to
you
i
know
not
where
you
are
i
do
not
know
if
heaven
hold
you
or
if
earth
transmute
body
and
soul
you
into
earth
again
but
this
i
know
not
for
one
second
space
shall
i
insult
my
sight
with
visionings
such
as
the
credulous
crowd
so
beholds
in
the
empty
air
let
the
world
wail
let
drip
its
easy
tears
my
sorrow
shall
be
dumb
what
do
i
say
god
god
god
pity
me
am
i
gone
mad
that
i
should
spit
upon
a
rosary
am
i
become
so
shrunken
would
to
god
i
too
might
feel
that
frenzied
faith
whose
touch
makes
temporal
the
most
enduring
grief
though
it
must
walk
a
while
as
is
its
wont
with
wild
lamenting
would
i
too
might
weep
where
weeps
the
world
and
hangs
its
piteous
wreaths
for
its
new
dead
not
truth
but
faith
it
is
that
keeps
the
world
alive
if
all
at
once
faith
were
to
slacken
that
unconscious
faith
which
must
i
know
yet
be
the
of
all
believing
birds
now
flying
fearless
across
would
drop
in
terror
to
the
earth
fishes
would
drown
and
the
reins
would
tangle
in
the
frantic
hands
of
god
and
the
worlds
gallop
headlong
to
destruction
o
god
i
see
it
now
and
my
sick
brain
staggers
and
swoons
how
often
over
me
flashes
this
breathlessness
of
sudden
sight
in
which
i
see
the
universe
unrolled
before
me
like
a
scroll
and
read
thereon
chaos
and
doom
where
helpless
planets
whirl
dizzily
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
like
tops
across
a
table
gathering
speed
with
every
spin
to
waver
on
the
edge
one
instant
looking
over
and
the
next
to
shudder
and
lurch
forward
out
of
sight
ah
i
am
worn
out
i
am
wearied
out
it
is
too
much
i
am
but
flesh
and
blood
and
i
must
sleep
though
you
were
dead
again
i
am
but
flesh
and
blood
and
i
must
sleep
the
suicide
curse
thee
life
i
will
live
with
thee
no
more
thou
hast
mocked
me
starved
me
beat
my
body
sore
and
all
for
a
pledge
that
was
not
pledged
by
me
i
have
kissed
thy
crust
and
eaten
sparingly
that
i
might
eat
again
and
met
thy
sneers
with
deprecations
and
thy
blows
with
tears
aye
from
thy
glutted
lash
glad
crawled
away
as
if
spent
passion
were
a
holiday
and
now
i
go
nor
threat
nor
easy
vow
of
tardy
kindness
can
avail
thee
now
with
me
whence
fear
and
faith
alike
are
flown
lonely
i
came
and
i
depart
alone
and
know
not
where
nor
unto
whom
i
go
but
that
thou
canst
not
follow
me
i
know
thus
i
to
life
and
ceased
but
through
my
brain
my
thought
ran
still
until
i
spake
again
ah
but
i
go
not
as
i
came
no
trace
is
mine
to
bear
away
of
that
old
grace
i
brought
i
have
been
heated
in
thy
fires
bent
by
thy
hands
fashioned
to
thy
desires
thy
mark
is
on
me
i
am
not
the
same
nor
ever
more
shall
be
as
when
i
came
ashes
am
i
of
all
that
once
i
seemed
in
me
all
sunk
that
leapt
and
all
that
dreamed
is
wakeful
for
alarm
oh
shame
to
thee
for
the
ill
change
that
thou
hast
wrought
in
me
who
laugh
no
more
nor
lift
my
throat
to
sing
ah
life
i
would
have
been
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
about
the
house
when
i
was
grown
if
thou
hadst
left
my
little
joys
alone
i
asked
of
thee
no
favor
save
this
one
that
thou
wouldst
leave
me
playing
in
the
sun
and
this
thou
didst
deny
calling
my
name
insistently
until
i
rose
and
came
i
saw
the
sun
no
it
were
not
well
so
long
on
these
unpleasant
thoughts
to
dwell
need
i
arise
and
renew
again
my
hated
tasks
but
i
am
through
with
all
things
save
my
thoughts
and
this
one
night
so
that
in
truth
i
seem
already
quite
free
and
remote
from
thee
i
feel
no
haste
and
no
reluctance
to
depart
i
taste
merely
with
thoughtful
mien
an
unknown
draught
that
in
a
little
while
i
shall
have
quaffed
thus
i
to
life
and
ceased
and
slightly
smiled
looking
at
nothing
and
my
thin
dreams
filed
before
me
one
by
one
till
once
again
i
set
new
words
unto
an
old
refrain
treasures
thou
hast
that
never
have
been
mine
warm
lights
in
many
a
secret
chamber
shine
of
thy
gaunt
house
and
gusts
of
song
have
blown
like
blossoms
out
to
me
that
sat
alone
and
i
have
waited
well
for
thee
to
show
if
any
share
were
mine
and
now
i
go
nothing
i
leave
and
if
i
naught
attain
i
shall
but
come
into
mine
own
again
thus
i
to
life
and
ceased
and
spake
no
more
but
turning
straightway
sought
a
certain
door
in
the
rear
wall
heavy
it
was
and
low
and
dark
a
way
by
which
none
would
go
that
other
exit
had
and
never
knock
was
heard
thereat
bearing
a
curious
lock
some
chance
had
shown
me
fashioned
faultily
whereof
life
held
content
the
useless
key
and
great
coarse
hinges
thick
and
rough
with
rust
whose
sudden
voice
across
a
silence
must
i
knew
be
harsh
and
horrible
to
hear
a
strange
door
ugly
like
a
so
near
i
came
i
felt
upon
my
feet
the
chill
of
acid
wind
creeping
across
the
sill
so
stood
longtime
till
over
me
at
last
came
weariness
and
all
things
other
passed
to
make
it
room
the
still
night
drifted
deep
like
snow
about
me
and
i
longed
for
sleep
but
suddenly
marking
the
morning
hour
bayed
the
bell
within
the
tower
startled
i
raised
my
head
and
with
a
shout
laid
hold
upon
the
latch
and
was
without
ah
road
leading
me
back
unto
my
old
abode
my
father
house
there
in
the
night
i
came
and
found
them
feasting
and
all
things
the
same
as
they
had
been
before
a
splendour
hung
upon
the
walls
and
such
sweet
songs
were
sung
as
echoing
out
of
very
long
ago
had
called
me
from
the
house
of
life
i
know
so
fair
their
raiment
shone
i
looked
in
shame
on
the
unlovely
garb
in
which
i
came
then
straightway
at
my
hesitancy
mocked
it
is
my
father
house
i
said
and
knocked
and
the
door
opened
to
the
shining
crowd
tattered
and
dark
i
entered
like
a
cloud
seeing
no
face
but
his
to
him
i
crept
and
father
i
cried
and
clasped
his
knees
and
wept
ah
days
of
joy
that
followed
all
alone
i
wandered
through
the
house
my
own
my
own
my
own
to
touch
my
own
to
taste
and
smell
all
i
had
lacked
so
long
and
loved
so
well
none
shook
me
out
of
sleep
nor
hushed
my
song
nor
called
me
in
from
the
sunlight
all
day
long
i
know
not
when
the
wonder
came
to
me
of
what
my
father
business
might
be
and
whither
fared
and
on
what
errands
bent
the
tall
and
gracious
messengers
he
sent
yet
one
day
with
no
song
from
dawn
till
night
wondering
i
sat
and
watched
them
out
of
sight
and
the
next
day
i
called
and
on
the
third
asked
them
if
i
might
go
but
no
one
heard
then
sick
with
longing
i
arose
at
last
and
went
unto
my
father
in
that
vast
chamber
wherein
he
for
so
many
years
has
sat
surrounded
by
his
charts
and
spheres
father
i
said
father
i
can
not
play
the
harp
that
thou
didst
give
me
and
all
day
i
sit
in
idleness
while
to
and
fro
about
me
thy
serene
grave
servants
go
and
i
am
weary
of
my
lonely
ease
better
a
perilous
journey
overseas
away
from
thee
than
this
the
life
i
lead
to
sit
all
day
in
the
sunshine
like
a
weed
that
grows
to
naught
i
love
thee
more
than
they
who
serve
thee
most
yet
serve
thee
in
no
way
father
i
beg
of
thee
a
little
task
to
dignify
my
days
is
all
i
ask
forever
but
forever
this
denied
i
perish
child
my
father
voice
replied
all
things
thy
fancy
hath
desired
of
me
thou
hast
received
i
have
prepared
for
thee
within
my
house
a
spacious
chamber
where
are
delicate
things
to
handle
and
to
wear
and
all
these
things
are
thine
dost
thou
love
song
my
minstrels
shall
attend
thee
all
day
long
or
sigh
for
flowers
my
fairest
gardens
stand
open
as
fields
to
thee
on
every
hand
and
all
thy
days
this
word
shall
hold
the
same
no
pleasure
shalt
thou
lack
that
thou
shalt
name
but
as
for
tasks
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
thou
hadst
thy
task
and
laidst
it
by
he
said
god
world
o
world
i
can
not
hold
thee
close
enough
thy
winds
thy
wide
grey
skies
thy
mists
that
roll
and
rise
thy
woods
this
autumn
day
that
ache
and
sag
and
all
but
cry
with
colour
that
gaunt
crag
to
crush
to
lift
the
lean
of
that
black
bluff
world
world
i
can
not
get
thee
close
enough
long
have
i
known
a
glory
in
it
all
but
never
knew
i
this
here
such
a
passion
is
as
stretcheth
me
apart
lord
i
do
fear
made
the
world
too
beautiful
this
year
my
soul
is
all
but
out
of
me
let
fall
no
burning
leaf
prithee
let
no
bird
call
afternoon
on
a
hill
i
will
be
the
gladdest
thing
under
the
sun
i
will
touch
a
hundred
flowers
and
not
pick
one
i
will
look
at
cliffs
and
clouds
with
quiet
eyes
watch
the
wind
bow
down
the
grass
and
the
grass
rise
and
when
lights
begin
to
show
up
from
the
town
i
will
mark
which
must
be
mine
and
then
start
down
sorrow
sorrow
like
a
ceaseless
rain
beats
upon
my
heart
people
twist
and
scream
in
pain
dawn
will
find
them
still
again
this
has
neither
wax
nor
wane
neither
stop
nor
start
people
dress
and
go
to
town
i
sit
in
my
chair
all
my
thoughts
are
slow
and
brown
standing
up
or
sitting
down
little
matters
or
what
gown
or
what
shoes
i
wear
tavern
i
keep
a
little
tavern
below
the
high
hill
crest
wherein
all
people
may
set
them
down
and
rest
there
shall
be
plates
and
mugs
to
melt
the
chill
of
all
the
people
who
happen
up
the
hill
there
sound
will
sleep
the
traveller
and
dream
his
journey
end
but
i
will
rouse
at
midnight
the
falling
fire
to
tend
aye
is
a
curious
fancy
but
all
the
good
i
know
was
taught
me
out
of
two
grey
eyes
a
long
time
ago
ashes
of
life
love
has
gone
and
left
me
and
the
days
are
all
alike
eat
i
must
and
sleep
i
will
and
would
that
night
were
here
but
ah
to
lie
awake
and
hear
the
slow
hours
strike
would
that
it
were
day
again
with
twilight
near
love
has
gone
and
left
me
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
this
or
that
or
what
you
will
is
all
the
same
to
me
but
all
the
things
that
i
begin
i
leave
before
i
through
there
little
use
in
anything
as
far
as
i
can
see
love
has
gone
and
left
me
and
the
neighbors
knock
and
borrow
and
life
goes
on
forever
like
the
gnawing
of
a
mouse
and
and
and
and
there
this
little
street
and
this
little
house
the
little
ghost
i
knew
her
for
a
little
ghost
that
in
my
garden
walked
the
wall
is
high
higher
than
most
and
the
green
gate
was
locked
and
yet
i
did
not
think
of
that
till
after
she
was
gone
i
knew
her
by
the
broad
white
hat
all
ruffled
she
had
on
by
the
dear
ruffles
round
her
feet
by
her
small
hands
that
hung
in
their
lace
mitts
austere
and
sweet
her
gown
white
folds
among
i
watched
to
see
if
she
would
stay
what
she
would
do
and
oh
she
looked
as
if
she
liked
the
way
i
let
my
garden
grow
she
bent
above
my
favourite
mint
with
conscious
garden
grace
she
smiled
and
smiled
there
was
no
hint
of
sadness
in
her
face
she
held
her
gown
on
either
side
to
let
her
slippers
show
and
up
the
walk
she
went
with
pride
the
way
great
ladies
go
and
where
the
wall
is
built
in
new
and
is
of
ivy
bare
she
paused
then
opened
and
passed
through
a
gate
that
once
was
there
kin
to
sorrow
am
i
kin
to
sorrow
that
so
oft
falls
the
knocker
of
my
door
neither
loud
nor
soft
but
as
long
accustomed
under
sorrow
hand
marigolds
around
the
step
and
rosemary
stand
and
then
comes
sorrow
and
what
does
sorrow
care
for
the
rosemary
or
the
marigolds
there
am
i
kin
to
sorrow
are
we
kin
that
so
oft
upon
my
door
come
three
songs
of
shattering
i
the
first
rose
on
my
budded
bloomed
and
shattered
during
sad
days
when
to
me
nothing
mattered
grief
of
grief
has
drained
me
clean
still
it
seems
a
pity
no
one
saw
it
must
have
been
very
pretty
ii
let
the
little
birds
sing
let
the
little
lambs
play
spring
is
here
and
so
is
spring
but
not
in
the
old
way
i
recall
a
place
where
a
grew
there
you
lifted
up
your
face
and
blossoms
covered
you
if
the
little
birds
sing
and
the
little
lambs
play
spring
is
here
and
so
is
spring
but
not
in
the
old
way
iii
all
the
blossoms
are
underneath
the
tree
ere
spring
was
going
ah
spring
is
gone
and
there
comes
no
summer
to
the
like
of
you
and
me
blossom
time
is
early
but
no
fruit
sets
on
all
the
blossoms
are
underneath
the
tree
browned
at
the
edges
turned
in
a
day
and
i
would
with
all
my
heart
they
trimmed
a
mound
for
me
and
weeds
were
tall
on
all
the
paths
that
led
that
way
the
shroud
death
i
say
my
heart
is
bowed
unto
thine
o
mother
this
red
gown
will
make
a
shroud
good
as
any
other
i
that
would
not
wait
to
wear
my
own
bridal
things
in
a
dress
dark
as
my
hair
made
my
answerings
i
that
till
he
came
could
not
could
not
wait
in
a
gown
as
bright
as
flame
held
for
them
the
gate
death
i
say
my
heart
is
bowed
unto
thine
o
mother
this
red
gown
will
make
a
shroud
good
as
any
other
the
dream
love
if
i
weep
it
will
not
matter
and
if
you
laugh
i
shall
not
care
foolish
am
i
to
think
about
it
but
it
is
good
to
feel
you
there
love
in
my
sleep
i
dreamed
of
waking
white
and
awful
the
moonlight
reached
over
the
floor
and
somewhere
somewhere
there
was
a
shutter
loose
it
screeched
swung
in
the
wind
and
no
wind
blowing
i
was
afraid
and
turned
to
you
put
out
my
hand
to
you
for
comfort
and
you
were
gone
cold
cold
as
dew
under
my
hand
the
moonlight
lay
love
if
you
laugh
i
shall
not
care
but
if
i
weep
it
will
not
matter
ah
it
is
good
to
feel
you
there
indifference
i
said
for
love
was
laggard
o
love
was
slow
to
come
i
hear
his
step
and
know
his
step
when
i
am
warm
in
bed
but
i
never
leave
my
pillow
though
there
be
some
as
would
let
him
in
and
take
him
in
with
tears
i
said
i
lay
for
love
was
laggard
o
he
came
not
until
dawn
i
lay
and
listened
for
his
step
and
could
not
get
to
sleep
and
he
found
me
at
my
window
with
my
big
cloak
on
all
sorry
with
the
tears
some
folks
might
weep
she
is
neither
pink
nor
pale
and
she
never
will
be
all
mine
she
learned
her
hands
in
a
and
her
mouth
on
a
valentine
she
has
more
hair
than
she
needs
in
the
sun
is
a
woe
to
me
and
her
voice
is
a
string
of
colored
beads
or
steps
leading
into
the
sea
she
loves
me
all
that
she
can
and
her
ways
to
my
ways
resign
but
she
was
not
made
for
any
man
and
she
never
will
be
all
mine
blight
hard
seeds
of
hate
i
planted
that
should
by
now
be
grown
rough
stalks
and
from
thick
stamens
a
poisonous
pollen
blown
and
odors
rank
unbreathable
from
dark
corollas
thrown
at
dawn
from
my
damp
garden
i
shook
the
chilly
dew
the
thin
boughs
locked
behind
me
that
sprang
to
let
me
through
the
blossoms
slept
i
sought
a
place
where
nothing
lovely
grew
and
there
when
day
was
breaking
i
knelt
and
looked
around
the
light
was
near
the
silence
was
palpitant
with
sound
i
drew
my
hate
from
out
my
breast
and
thrust
it
in
the
ground
oh
ye
so
fiercely
tended
ye
little
seeds
of
hate
i
bent
above
your
growing
early
and
noon
and
late
yet
are
ye
drooped
and
pitiful
i
can
not
rear
ye
straight
the
sun
seeks
out
my
garden
no
nook
is
left
in
shade
no
mist
nor
mold
nor
mildew
endures
on
any
blade
sweet
rain
slants
under
every
bough
ye
falter
and
ye
fade
when
the
year
grows
old
i
can
not
but
remember
when
the
year
grows
old
october
november
how
she
disliked
the
cold
she
used
to
watch
the
swallows
go
down
across
the
sky
and
turn
from
the
window
with
a
little
sharp
sigh
and
often
when
the
brown
leaves
were
brittle
on
the
ground
and
the
wind
in
the
chimney
made
a
melancholy
sound
she
had
a
look
about
her
that
i
wish
i
could
forget
the
look
of
a
scared
thing
sitting
in
a
net
oh
beautiful
at
nightfall
the
soft
spitting
snow
and
beautiful
the
bare
boughs
rubbing
to
and
fro
but
the
roaring
of
the
fire
and
the
warmth
of
fur
and
the
boiling
of
the
kettle
were
beautiful
to
her
i
can
not
but
remember
when
the
year
grows
old
october
november
how
she
disliked
the
cold
sonnets
i
thou
art
not
lovelier
than
lilacs
no
nor
honeysuckle
thou
art
not
more
fair
than
small
white
single
poppies
i
can
bear
thy
beauty
though
i
bend
before
thee
though
from
left
to
right
not
knowing
where
to
go
i
turn
my
troubled
eyes
nor
here
nor
there
find
any
refuge
from
thee
yet
i
swear
so
has
it
been
with
mist
with
moonlight
so
like
him
who
day
by
day
unto
his
draught
of
delicate
poison
adds
him
one
drop
more
till
he
may
drink
unharmed
the
death
of
ten
even
so
inured
to
beauty
who
have
quaffed
each
hour
more
deeply
than
the
hour
before
i
drink
and
live
what
has
destroyed
some
men
ii
time
does
not
bring
relief
you
all
have
lied
who
told
me
time
would
ease
me
of
my
pain
i
miss
him
in
the
weeping
of
the
rain
i
want
him
at
the
shrinking
of
the
tide
the
old
snows
melt
from
every
and
last
year
leaves
are
smoke
in
every
lane
but
last
year
bitter
loving
must
remain
heaped
on
my
heart
and
my
old
thoughts
abide
there
are
a
hundred
places
where
i
fear
to
go
so
with
his
memory
they
brim
and
entering
with
relief
some
quiet
place
where
never
fell
his
foot
or
shone
his
face
i
say
there
is
no
memory
of
him
here
and
so
stand
stricken
so
remembering
him
iii
mindful
of
you
the
sodden
earth
in
spring
and
all
the
flowers
that
in
the
springtime
grow
and
dusty
roads
and
thistles
and
the
slow
rising
of
the
round
moon
all
throats
that
sing
the
summer
through
and
each
departing
wing
and
all
the
nests
that
the
bared
branches
show
and
all
winds
that
in
any
weather
blow
and
all
the
storms
that
the
four
seasons
bring
you
go
no
more
on
your
exultant
feet
up
paths
that
only
mist
and
morning
knew
or
watch
the
wind
or
listen
to
the
beat
of
a
bird
wings
too
high
in
air
to
view
but
you
were
something
more
than
young
and
sweet
and
fair
and
the
long
year
remembers
you
iv
not
in
this
chamber
only
at
my
birth
when
the
long
hours
of
that
mysterious
night
were
over
and
the
morning
was
in
sight
i
cried
but
in
strange
places
steppe
and
firth
i
have
not
seen
through
alien
grief
and
mirth
and
never
shall
one
room
contain
me
quite
who
in
so
many
rooms
first
saw
the
light
child
of
all
mothers
native
of
the
earth
so
is
no
warmth
for
me
at
any
fire
when
the
world
fire
has
burned
so
low
i
kneel
spending
my
breath
in
vain
desire
at
that
cold
hearth
which
one
time
roared
so
strong
and
straighten
back
in
weariness
and
long
to
gather
up
my
little
gods
and
go
v
if
i
should
learn
in
some
quite
casual
way
that
you
were
gone
not
to
return
again
read
from
the
of
a
paper
say
held
by
a
neighbor
in
a
subway
train
how
at
the
corner
of
this
avenue
and
such
a
street
so
are
the
papers
filled
a
hurrying
man
who
happened
to
be
you
at
noon
had
happened
to
be
killed
i
should
not
cry
aloud
i
could
not
cry
aloud
or
wring
my
hands
in
such
a
place
i
should
but
watch
the
station
lights
rush
by
with
a
more
careful
interest
on
my
face
or
raise
my
eyes
and
read
with
greater
care
where
to
store
furs
and
how
to
treat
the
hair
vi
bluebeard
this
door
you
might
not
open
and
you
did
so
enter
now
and
see
for
what
slight
thing
you
are
betrayed
here
is
no
treasure
hid
no
cauldron
no
clear
crystal
mirroring
the
truth
no
heads
of
women
slain
for
greed
like
yours
no
writhings
of
distress
but
only
what
you
see
look
yet
again
an
empty
room
cobwebbed
and
comfortless
yet
this
alone
out
of
my
life
i
kept
unto
myself
lest
any
know
me
quite
and
you
did
so
profane
me
when
you
crept
unto
the
threshold
of
this
room
that
i
must
never
more
behold
your
face
this
now
is
yours
i
seek
another
place
