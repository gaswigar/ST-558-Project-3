preface
the
contents
of
this
as
of
the
other
volumes
in
the
series
have
been
drawn
from
schopenhauer
and
amongst
the
various
subjects
dealt
with
in
that
famous
collection
of
essays
literature
holds
an
important
place
nor
can
schopenhauer
opinions
fail
to
be
of
special
value
when
he
treats
of
literary
form
and
method
for
quite
apart
from
his
philosophical
pretensions
he
claims
recognition
as
a
great
writer
he
is
indeed
one
of
the
best
of
the
few
really
excellent
of
whom
germany
can
boast
while
he
is
thus
particularly
qualified
to
speak
of
literature
as
an
art
he
has
also
something
to
say
upon
those
influences
which
outside
of
his
own
merits
contribute
so
much
to
an
author
success
and
are
so
often
undervalued
when
he
obtains
immediate
popularity
schopenhauer
own
sore
experiences
in
the
matter
of
reputation
lend
an
interest
to
his
remarks
upon
that
subject
although
it
is
too
much
to
ask
of
human
nature
that
he
should
approach
it
in
any
dispassionate
spirit
in
the
following
pages
we
have
observations
upon
style
by
one
who
was
a
stylist
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
not
affected
nor
yet
a
phrasemonger
on
thinking
for
oneself
by
a
philosopher
who
never
did
anything
else
on
criticism
by
a
writer
who
suffered
much
from
the
inability
of
others
to
understand
him
on
reputation
by
a
candidate
who
during
the
greater
part
of
his
life
deserved
without
obtaining
it
and
on
genius
by
one
who
was
incontestably
of
the
privileged
order
himself
and
whatever
may
be
thought
of
some
of
his
opinions
on
matters
of
detail
on
anonymity
for
instance
or
on
the
question
whether
good
work
is
never
done
for
money
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
general
view
of
literature
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
flourishes
is
perfectly
sound
it
might
be
thought
perhaps
that
remarks
which
were
meant
to
apply
to
the
german
language
would
have
but
little
bearing
upon
one
so
different
from
it
as
english
this
would
be
a
just
objection
if
schopenhauer
treated
literature
in
a
petty
spirit
and
confined
himself
to
pedantic
inquiries
into
matters
of
grammar
and
etymology
or
mere
niceties
of
phrase
but
this
is
not
so
he
deals
with
his
subject
broadly
and
takes
large
and
general
views
nor
can
anyone
who
knows
anything
of
the
philosopher
suppose
this
to
mean
that
he
is
vague
and
feeble
it
is
true
that
now
and
again
in
the
course
of
these
essays
he
makes
remarks
which
are
obviously
meant
to
apply
to
the
failings
of
certain
writers
of
his
own
age
and
country
but
in
such
a
case
i
have
generally
given
his
sentences
a
turn
which
while
keeping
them
faithful
to
the
spirit
of
the
original
secures
for
them
a
less
restricted
range
and
makes
schopenhauer
a
critic
of
similar
faults
in
whatever
age
or
country
they
may
appear
this
has
been
done
in
spite
of
a
sharp
word
on
page
seventeen
of
this
volume
addressed
to
translators
who
dare
to
revise
their
author
but
the
change
is
one
with
which
not
even
schopenhauer
could
quarrel
it
is
thus
a
significant
fact
a
testimony
to
the
depth
of
his
insight
and
in
the
main
the
justice
of
his
opinions
that
views
of
literature
which
appealed
to
his
own
immediate
contemporaries
should
be
found
to
hold
good
elsewhere
and
at
a
distance
of
fifty
years
it
means
that
what
he
had
to
say
was
worth
saying
and
since
it
is
adapted
thus
equally
to
diverse
times
and
audiences
it
is
probably
of
permanent
interest
the
intelligent
reader
will
observe
that
much
of
the
charm
of
schopenhauer
writing
comes
from
its
strongly
personal
character
and
that
here
he
has
to
do
not
with
a
mere
maker
of
books
but
with
a
man
who
thinks
for
himself
and
has
no
false
scruples
in
putting
his
meaning
plainly
upon
the
page
or
in
unmasking
sham
wherever
he
finds
it
this
is
nowhere
so
true
as
when
he
deals
with
literature
and
just
as
in
his
treatment
of
life
he
is
no
flatterer
to
men
in
general
so
here
he
is
free
and
outspoken
on
the
peculiar
failings
of
authors
at
the
same
time
he
gives
them
good
advice
he
is
particularly
happy
in
recommending
restraint
in
regard
to
reading
the
works
of
others
and
the
cultivation
of
independent
thought
and
herein
he
recalls
a
saying
attributed
to
hobbes
who
was
not
less
distinguished
as
a
writer
than
as
a
philosopher
to
the
effect
that
he
had
read
as
much
as
other
men
he
should
have
been
as
ignorant
as
schopenhauer
also
utters
a
warning
which
we
shall
do
well
to
take
to
heart
in
these
days
against
mingling
the
pursuit
of
literature
with
vulgar
aims
if
we
follow
him
here
we
shall
carefully
distinguish
between
literature
as
an
object
of
life
and
literature
as
a
means
of
living
between
the
real
love
of
truth
and
beauty
and
that
detestable
false
love
which
looks
to
the
price
it
will
fetch
in
the
market
i
am
not
referring
to
those
who
while
they
follow
a
useful
and
honorable
calling
in
bringing
literature
before
the
public
are
content
to
be
known
as
men
of
business
if
by
the
help
of
some
second
witch
of
endor
we
could
raise
the
ghost
of
schopenhauer
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
his
opinion
of
a
certain
kind
of
literary
enterprise
which
has
come
into
vogue
since
his
day
and
now
receives
an
amount
of
attention
very
much
beyond
its
due
we
may
hazard
a
guess
at
the
direction
his
opinion
would
take
he
would
doubtless
show
us
how
this
enterprise
which
is
carried
on
by
ends
by
making
literature
into
a
form
of
merchandise
and
treating
it
as
though
it
were
so
much
goods
to
be
bought
and
sold
at
a
profit
and
most
likely
to
produce
quick
returns
if
the
maker
name
is
well
known
nor
would
it
be
the
ghost
of
the
real
schopenhauer
unless
we
heard
a
vigorous
denunciation
of
men
who
claim
a
connection
with
literature
by
a
servile
flattery
of
successful
living
authors
the
dead
can
not
be
made
to
pay
in
the
hope
of
appearing
to
advantage
in
their
reflected
light
and
turning
that
advantage
into
money
in
order
to
present
the
contents
of
this
book
in
a
convenient
form
i
have
not
scrupled
to
make
an
arrangement
with
the
chapters
somewhat
different
from
that
which
exists
in
the
original
so
that
two
or
more
subjects
which
are
there
dealt
with
successively
in
one
and
the
same
chapter
here
stand
by
themselves
in
consequence
of
this
some
of
the
titles
of
the
sections
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
original
i
may
state
however
that
the
essays
on
and
and
the
latter
part
of
that
on
are
taken
direct
from
the
chapter
headed
schriftstellerei
und
and
that
the
remainder
of
the
essay
on
with
that
of
is
supplied
by
the
remarks
urtheil
kritik
beifall
und
the
essays
on
study
of
on
of
and
on
forms
of
are
taken
chiefly
from
the
four
sections
gelehrsamkeit
und
gelehrte
ueber
sprache
und
worte
ueber
lesen
und
bücher
and
metaphysik
des
the
essay
on
for
is
a
rendering
of
certain
remarks
under
the
heading
was
a
favorite
subject
of
speculation
with
schopenhauer
and
he
often
touches
upon
it
in
the
course
of
his
works
always
however
to
put
forth
the
same
theory
in
regard
to
it
as
may
be
found
in
the
concluding
section
of
this
volume
though
the
essay
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
literary
method
the
subject
of
which
it
treats
is
the
most
needful
element
of
success
in
literature
and
i
have
introduced
it
on
that
ground
it
forms
part
of
a
chapter
in
the
entitled
intellekt
überhaupt
und
in
jeder
beziehung
betreffende
gedanken
anhang
verwandter
it
has
also
been
part
of
my
duty
to
invent
a
title
for
this
volume
and
i
am
well
aware
that
objection
may
be
made
to
the
one
i
have
chosen
on
the
ground
that
in
common
language
it
is
unusual
to
speak
of
literature
as
an
art
and
that
to
do
so
is
unduly
to
narrow
its
meaning
and
to
leave
out
of
sight
its
main
function
as
the
record
of
thought
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
word
should
not
be
employed
in
that
double
sense
which
is
allowed
to
attach
to
music
as
signifying
either
the
objective
outcome
of
a
certain
mental
activity
seeking
to
express
itself
in
outward
form
or
else
the
particular
kind
of
mental
activity
in
question
and
the
methods
it
follows
and
we
do
in
fact
use
it
in
this
latter
sense
when
we
say
of
a
writer
that
he
pursues
literature
as
a
calling
if
then
literature
can
be
taken
to
mean
a
process
as
well
as
a
result
of
mental
activity
there
can
be
no
error
in
speaking
of
it
as
art
i
use
that
term
in
its
broad
sense
as
meaning
skill
in
the
display
of
thought
or
more
fully
a
right
use
of
the
rules
of
applying
to
the
practical
exhibition
of
thought
with
whatever
material
it
may
deal
in
connection
with
literature
this
is
a
sense
and
an
application
of
the
term
which
have
been
sufficiently
established
by
the
example
of
the
great
writers
of
antiquity
it
may
be
asked
of
course
whether
the
true
thinker
who
will
always
form
the
soul
of
the
true
author
will
not
be
so
much
occupied
with
what
he
has
to
say
that
it
will
appear
to
him
a
trivial
thing
to
spend
great
effort
on
embellishing
the
form
in
which
he
delivers
it
literature
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
it
is
true
deal
with
noble
matter
the
riddle
of
our
existence
the
great
facts
of
life
the
changing
passions
of
the
human
heart
the
discernment
of
some
deep
moral
truth
it
is
easy
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
the
mere
garment
of
thought
to
be
too
precise
to
give
to
the
arrangement
of
words
an
attention
that
should
rather
be
paid
to
the
promotion
of
fresh
ideas
a
writer
who
makes
this
mistake
is
like
a
fop
who
spends
his
little
mind
in
adorning
his
person
in
short
it
may
be
charged
against
the
view
of
literature
which
is
taken
in
calling
it
an
art
that
instead
of
making
truth
and
insight
the
author
aim
it
favors
sciolism
and
a
fantastic
and
affected
style
there
is
no
doubt
some
justice
in
the
objection
nor
have
we
in
our
own
day
and
especially
amongst
younger
men
any
lack
of
writers
who
endeavor
to
win
confidence
not
by
adding
to
the
stock
of
ideas
in
the
world
but
by
despising
the
use
of
plain
language
their
faults
are
not
new
in
the
history
of
literature
and
it
is
a
pleasing
sign
of
schopenhauer
insight
that
a
merciless
exposure
of
them
as
they
existed
half
a
century
ago
is
still
quite
applicable
to
their
modern
form
and
since
these
writers
who
may
in
the
slang
of
the
hour
be
called
impressionists
in
literature
follow
their
own
bad
taste
in
the
manufacture
of
dainty
phrases
devoid
of
all
nerve
and
generally
with
some
quite
commonplace
meaning
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
to
discriminate
carefully
between
artifice
and
art
but
although
they
may
learn
something
from
schopenhauer
advice
it
is
not
chiefly
to
them
that
it
is
offered
it
is
to
that
great
mass
of
writers
whose
business
is
to
fill
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
and
the
pages
of
the
review
and
to
produce
the
ton
of
novels
that
appear
every
year
now
that
almost
everyone
who
can
hold
a
pen
aspires
to
be
called
an
author
it
is
well
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
literature
is
an
art
in
some
respects
more
important
than
any
other
the
problem
of
this
art
is
the
discovery
of
those
qualities
of
style
and
treatment
which
entitled
any
work
to
be
called
good
literature
it
will
be
safe
to
warn
the
reader
at
the
very
outset
that
if
he
wishes
to
avoid
being
led
astray
he
should
in
his
search
for
these
qualities
turn
to
books
that
have
stood
the
test
of
time
for
such
an
amount
of
hasty
writing
is
done
in
these
days
that
it
is
really
difficult
for
anyone
who
reads
much
of
it
to
avoid
contracting
its
faults
and
thus
gradually
coming
to
terms
of
dangerous
familiarity
with
bad
methods
this
advice
will
be
especially
needful
if
things
that
have
little
or
no
claim
to
be
called
literature
at
all
the
newspapers
the
monthly
magazine
and
the
last
new
tale
of
intrigue
or
adventure
fill
a
large
measure
if
not
the
whole
of
the
time
given
to
reading
nor
are
those
who
are
sincerely
anxious
to
have
the
best
thought
in
the
best
language
quite
free
from
danger
if
they
give
too
much
attention
to
the
contemporary
authors
even
though
these
seem
to
think
and
write
excellently
for
one
generation
alone
is
incompetent
to
decide
upon
the
merits
of
any
author
whatever
and
as
literature
like
all
art
is
a
thing
of
human
invention
so
it
can
be
pronounced
good
only
if
it
obtains
lasting
admiration
by
establishing
a
permanent
appeal
to
mankind
deepest
feeling
for
truth
and
beauty
it
is
in
this
sense
that
schopenhauer
is
perfectly
right
in
holding
that
neglect
of
the
ancient
classics
which
are
the
best
of
all
models
in
the
art
of
writing
will
infallibly
lead
to
a
degeneration
of
literature
and
the
method
of
discovering
the
best
qualities
of
style
and
of
forming
a
theory
of
writing
is
not
to
follow
some
trick
or
mannerism
that
happens
to
please
for
the
moment
but
to
study
the
way
in
which
great
authors
have
done
their
best
work
it
will
be
said
that
schopenhauer
tells
us
nothing
we
did
not
know
before
perhaps
so
as
he
himself
says
the
best
things
are
seldom
new
but
he
puts
the
old
truths
in
a
fresh
and
forcible
way
and
no
one
who
knows
anything
of
good
literature
will
deny
that
these
truths
are
just
now
of
very
fit
application
it
was
probably
to
meet
a
real
want
that
a
year
or
two
ago
an
ingenious
person
succeeded
in
drawing
a
great
number
of
english
and
american
writers
into
a
confession
of
their
literary
creed
and
the
art
they
adopted
in
authorship
and
the
interesting
volume
in
which
he
gave
these
confessions
to
the
world
contained
some
very
good
advice
although
most
of
it
had
been
said
before
in
different
forms
more
recently
a
new
departure
of
very
doubtful
use
has
taken
place
and
two
books
have
been
issued
which
aim
the
one
at
being
an
manual
the
other
at
giving
hints
on
essays
and
how
to
write
them
a
glance
at
these
books
will
probably
show
that
their
authors
have
still
something
to
learn
both
of
these
ventures
seem
unhappily
to
be
popular
and
although
they
may
claim
a
position
to
that
of
the
present
volume
i
beg
to
say
that
it
has
no
connection
with
them
whatever
schopenhauer
does
not
attempt
to
teach
the
art
of
making
bricks
without
straw
i
wish
to
take
this
opportunity
of
tendering
my
thanks
to
a
large
number
of
reviewers
for
the
very
gratifying
reception
given
to
the
earlier
volumes
of
this
series
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
expressing
my
obligations
to
my
friend
collingwood
who
has
looked
over
most
of
my
proofs
and
often
given
me
excellent
advice
in
my
effort
to
turn
schopenhauer
into
readable
english
on
authorship
there
are
first
of
all
two
kinds
of
authors
those
who
write
for
the
subject
sake
and
those
who
write
for
writing
sake
while
the
one
have
had
thoughts
or
experiences
which
seem
to
them
worth
communicating
the
others
want
money
and
so
they
write
for
money
their
thinking
is
part
of
the
business
of
writing
they
may
be
recognized
by
the
way
in
which
they
spin
out
their
thoughts
to
the
greatest
possible
length
then
too
by
the
very
nature
of
their
thoughts
which
are
only
perverse
forced
vacillating
again
by
the
aversion
they
generally
show
to
saying
anything
straight
out
so
that
they
may
seem
other
than
they
are
hence
their
writing
is
deficient
in
clearness
and
definiteness
and
it
is
not
long
before
they
betray
that
their
only
object
in
writing
at
all
is
to
cover
paper
this
sometimes
happens
with
the
best
authors
now
and
then
for
example
with
lessing
in
his
and
even
in
many
of
jean
paul
romances
as
soon
as
the
reader
perceives
this
let
him
throw
the
book
away
for
time
is
precious
the
truth
is
that
when
an
author
begins
to
write
for
the
sake
of
covering
paper
he
is
cheating
the
reader
because
he
writes
under
the
pretext
that
he
has
something
to
say
writing
for
money
and
reservation
of
copyright
are
at
bottom
the
ruin
of
literature
no
one
writes
anything
that
is
worth
writing
unless
he
writes
entirely
for
the
sake
of
his
subject
what
an
inestimable
boon
it
would
be
if
in
every
branch
of
literature
there
were
only
a
few
books
but
those
excellent
this
can
never
happen
as
long
as
money
is
to
be
made
by
writing
it
seems
as
though
the
money
lay
under
a
curse
for
every
author
degenerates
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
put
pen
to
paper
in
any
way
for
the
sake
of
gain
the
best
works
of
the
greatest
men
all
come
from
the
time
when
they
had
to
write
for
nothing
or
for
very
little
and
here
too
that
spanish
proverb
holds
good
which
declares
that
honor
and
money
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
same
purse
y
provecho
no
caben
en
un
the
reason
why
literature
is
in
such
a
bad
plight
nowadays
is
simply
and
solely
that
people
write
books
to
make
money
a
man
who
is
in
want
sits
down
and
writes
a
book
and
the
public
is
stupid
enough
to
buy
it
the
secondary
effect
of
this
is
the
ruin
of
language
a
great
many
bad
writers
make
their
whole
living
by
that
foolish
mania
of
the
public
for
reading
nothing
but
what
has
just
been
printed
journalists
i
mean
truly
a
most
appropriate
name
in
plain
language
it
is
again
it
may
be
said
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
authors
first
come
those
who
write
without
thinking
they
write
from
a
full
memory
from
reminiscences
it
may
be
even
straight
out
of
other
books
this
class
is
the
most
numerous
then
come
those
who
do
their
thinking
whilst
they
are
writing
they
think
in
order
to
write
and
there
is
no
lack
of
them
last
of
all
come
those
authors
who
think
before
they
begin
to
write
they
are
rare
authors
of
the
second
class
who
put
off
their
thinking
until
they
come
to
write
are
like
a
sportsman
who
goes
forth
at
random
and
is
not
likely
to
bring
very
much
home
on
the
other
hand
when
an
author
of
the
third
or
rare
class
writes
it
is
like
a
here
the
game
has
been
previously
captured
and
shut
up
within
a
very
small
space
from
which
it
is
afterwards
let
out
so
many
at
a
time
into
another
space
also
confined
the
game
can
not
possibly
escape
the
sportsman
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
aim
and
fire
in
other
words
write
down
his
thoughts
this
is
a
kind
of
sport
from
which
a
man
has
something
to
show
but
even
though
the
number
of
those
who
really
think
seriously
before
they
begin
to
write
is
small
extremely
few
of
them
think
about
subject
the
remainder
think
only
about
the
books
that
have
been
written
on
the
subject
and
what
has
been
said
by
others
in
order
to
think
at
all
such
writers
need
the
more
direct
and
powerful
stimulus
of
having
other
people
thoughts
before
them
these
become
their
immediate
theme
and
the
result
is
that
they
are
always
under
their
influence
and
so
never
in
any
real
sense
of
the
word
are
original
but
the
former
are
roused
to
thought
by
the
subject
itself
to
which
their
thinking
is
thus
immediately
directed
this
is
the
only
class
that
produces
writers
of
abiding
fame
it
must
of
course
be
understood
that
i
am
speaking
here
of
writers
who
treat
of
great
subjects
not
of
writers
on
the
art
of
making
brandy
unless
an
author
takes
the
material
on
which
he
writes
out
of
his
own
head
that
is
to
say
from
his
own
observation
he
is
not
worth
reading
compilers
the
common
run
of
and
many
others
of
the
same
class
take
their
material
immediately
out
of
books
and
the
material
goes
straight
to
their
without
even
paying
freight
or
undergoing
examination
as
it
passes
through
their
heads
to
say
nothing
of
elaboration
or
revision
how
very
learned
many
a
man
would
be
if
he
knew
everything
that
was
in
his
own
books
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
these
writers
talk
in
such
a
loose
and
vague
manner
that
the
reader
puzzles
his
brain
in
vain
to
understand
what
it
is
of
which
they
are
really
thinking
they
are
thinking
of
nothing
it
may
now
and
then
be
the
case
that
the
book
from
which
they
copy
has
been
composed
exactly
in
the
same
way
so
that
writing
of
this
sort
is
like
a
plaster
cast
of
a
cast
and
in
the
end
the
bare
outline
of
the
face
and
that
too
hardly
recognizable
is
all
that
is
left
to
your
antinous
let
compilations
be
read
as
seldom
as
possible
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
them
altogether
since
compilations
also
include
those
which
contain
in
a
small
space
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
centuries
there
is
no
greater
mistake
than
to
suppose
that
the
last
work
is
always
the
more
correct
that
what
is
written
later
on
is
in
every
case
an
improvement
on
what
was
written
before
and
that
change
always
means
progress
real
thinkers
men
of
right
judgment
people
who
are
in
earnest
with
their
subject
these
are
all
exceptions
only
vermin
is
the
rule
everywhere
in
the
world
it
is
always
on
the
alert
taking
the
mature
opinions
of
the
thinkers
and
industriously
seeking
to
improve
upon
them
save
the
mark
in
its
own
peculiar
way
if
the
reader
wishes
to
study
any
subject
let
him
beware
of
rushing
to
the
newest
books
upon
it
and
confining
his
attention
to
them
alone
under
the
notion
that
science
is
always
advancing
and
that
the
old
books
have
been
drawn
upon
in
the
writing
of
the
new
they
have
been
drawn
upon
it
is
true
but
how
the
writer
of
the
new
book
often
does
not
understand
the
old
books
thoroughly
and
yet
he
is
unwilling
to
take
their
exact
words
so
he
bungles
them
and
says
in
his
own
bad
way
that
which
has
been
said
very
much
better
and
more
clearly
by
the
old
writers
who
wrote
from
their
own
lively
knowledge
of
the
subject
the
new
writer
frequently
omits
the
best
things
they
say
their
most
striking
illustrations
their
happiest
remarks
because
he
does
not
see
their
value
or
feel
how
pregnant
they
are
the
only
thing
that
appeals
to
him
is
what
is
shallow
and
insipid
it
often
happens
that
an
old
and
excellent
book
is
ousted
by
new
and
bad
ones
which
written
for
money
appear
with
an
air
of
great
pretension
and
much
puffing
on
the
part
of
friends
in
science
a
man
tries
to
make
his
mark
by
bringing
out
something
fresh
this
often
means
nothing
more
than
that
he
attacks
some
received
theory
which
is
quite
correct
in
order
to
make
room
for
his
own
false
notions
sometimes
the
effort
is
successful
for
a
time
and
then
a
return
is
made
to
the
old
and
true
theory
these
innovators
are
serious
about
nothing
but
their
own
precious
self
it
is
this
that
they
want
to
put
forward
and
the
quick
way
of
doing
so
as
they
think
is
to
start
a
paradox
their
sterile
heads
take
naturally
to
the
path
of
negation
so
they
begin
to
deny
truths
that
have
long
been
admitted
the
vital
power
for
example
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
bichat
distinction
between
the
working
of
the
passions
and
the
working
of
intelligence
or
else
they
want
us
to
return
to
crass
atomism
and
the
like
hence
it
frequently
happens
that
course
of
science
is
to
this
class
of
writers
belong
those
translators
who
not
only
translate
their
author
but
also
correct
and
revise
him
a
proceeding
which
always
seems
to
me
impertinent
to
such
writers
i
say
write
books
yourself
which
are
worth
translating
and
leave
other
works
as
they
are
the
reader
should
study
if
he
can
the
real
authors
the
men
who
have
founded
and
discovered
things
or
at
any
rate
those
who
are
recognized
as
the
great
masters
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
let
him
buy
books
rather
than
read
their
contents
in
new
ones
to
be
sure
it
is
easy
to
add
to
any
new
discovery
aliquid
addere
facile
and
therefore
the
student
after
well
mastering
the
rudiments
of
his
subject
will
have
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
more
recent
additions
to
the
knowledge
of
it
and
in
general
the
following
rule
may
be
laid
down
here
as
elsewhere
if
a
thing
is
new
it
is
seldom
good
because
if
it
is
good
it
is
only
for
a
short
time
new
what
the
address
is
to
a
letter
the
title
should
be
to
a
book
in
other
words
its
main
object
should
be
to
bring
the
book
to
those
amongst
the
public
who
will
take
an
interest
in
its
contents
it
should
therefore
be
expressive
and
since
by
its
very
nature
it
must
be
short
it
should
be
concise
laconic
pregnant
and
if
possible
give
the
contents
in
one
word
a
prolix
title
is
bad
and
so
is
one
that
says
nothing
or
is
obscure
and
ambiguous
or
even
it
may
be
false
and
misleading
this
last
may
possibly
involve
the
book
in
the
same
fate
as
overtakes
a
wrongly
addressed
letter
the
worst
titles
of
all
are
those
which
have
been
stolen
those
i
mean
which
have
already
been
borne
by
other
books
for
they
are
in
the
first
place
a
plagiarism
and
secondly
the
most
convincing
proof
of
a
total
lack
of
originality
in
the
author
a
man
who
has
not
enough
originality
to
invent
a
new
title
for
his
book
will
be
still
less
able
to
give
it
new
contents
akin
to
these
stolen
titles
are
those
which
have
been
imitated
that
is
to
say
stolen
to
the
extent
of
one
half
for
instance
long
after
i
had
produced
my
treatise
will
in
oersted
wrote
a
book
entitled
mind
in
a
book
can
never
be
anything
more
than
the
impress
of
its
thoughts
and
the
value
of
these
will
lie
either
in
matter
about
which
he
has
or
in
the
which
his
thoughts
take
in
other
words
it
is
that
he
has
thought
about
the
matter
of
books
is
most
various
and
various
also
are
the
several
excellences
attaching
to
books
on
the
score
of
their
matter
by
matter
i
mean
everything
that
comes
within
the
domain
of
actual
experience
that
is
to
say
the
facts
of
history
and
the
facts
of
nature
taken
in
and
by
themselves
and
in
their
widest
sense
here
it
is
the
treated
of
which
gives
its
peculiar
character
to
the
book
so
that
a
book
can
be
important
whoever
it
was
that
wrote
it
but
in
regard
to
the
form
the
peculiar
character
of
a
book
depends
upon
the
who
wrote
it
it
may
treat
of
matters
which
are
accessible
to
everyone
and
well
known
but
it
is
the
way
in
which
they
are
treated
what
it
is
that
is
thought
about
them
that
gives
the
book
its
value
and
this
comes
from
its
author
if
then
from
this
point
of
view
a
book
is
excellent
and
beyond
comparison
so
is
its
author
it
follows
that
if
a
writer
is
worth
reading
his
merit
rises
just
in
proportion
as
he
owes
little
to
his
matter
therefore
the
better
known
and
the
more
hackneyed
this
is
the
greater
he
will
be
the
three
great
tragedians
of
greece
for
example
all
worked
at
the
same
so
when
a
book
is
celebrated
care
should
be
taken
to
note
whether
it
is
so
on
account
of
its
matter
or
its
form
and
a
distinction
should
be
made
accordingly
books
of
great
importance
on
account
of
their
matter
may
proceed
from
very
ordinary
and
shallow
people
by
the
fact
that
they
alone
have
had
access
to
this
matter
books
for
instance
which
describe
journeys
in
distant
lands
rare
natural
phenomena
or
experiments
or
historical
occurrences
of
which
the
writers
were
witnesses
or
in
connection
with
which
they
have
spent
much
time
and
trouble
in
the
research
and
special
study
of
original
documents
on
the
other
hand
where
the
matter
is
accessible
to
everyone
or
very
well
known
everything
will
depend
upon
the
form
and
what
it
is
that
is
thought
about
the
matter
will
give
the
book
all
the
value
it
possesses
here
only
a
really
distinguished
man
will
be
able
to
produce
anything
worth
reading
for
the
others
will
think
nothing
but
what
anyone
else
can
think
they
will
just
produce
an
impress
of
their
own
minds
but
this
is
a
print
of
which
everyone
possesses
the
original
however
the
public
is
very
much
more
concerned
to
have
matter
than
form
and
for
this
very
reason
it
is
deficient
in
any
high
degree
of
culture
the
public
shows
its
preference
in
this
respect
in
the
most
laughable
way
when
it
comes
to
deal
with
poetry
for
there
it
devotes
much
trouble
to
the
task
of
tracking
out
the
actual
events
or
personal
circumstances
in
the
life
of
the
poet
which
served
as
the
occasion
of
his
various
works
nay
these
events
and
circumstances
come
in
the
end
to
be
of
greater
importance
than
the
works
themselves
and
rather
than
read
goethe
himself
people
prefer
to
read
what
has
been
written
about
him
and
to
study
the
legend
of
faust
more
industriously
than
the
drama
of
that
name
and
when
bürger
declared
that
people
would
write
learned
disquisitions
on
the
question
who
leonora
really
was
we
find
this
literally
fulfilled
in
goethe
case
for
we
now
possess
a
great
many
learned
disquisitions
on
faust
and
the
legend
attaching
to
him
study
of
this
kind
is
and
remains
devoted
to
the
material
of
the
drama
alone
to
give
such
preference
to
the
matter
over
the
form
is
as
though
a
man
were
to
take
a
fine
etruscan
vase
not
to
admire
its
shape
or
coloring
but
to
make
a
chemical
analysis
of
the
clay
and
paint
of
which
it
is
composed
the
attempt
to
produce
an
effect
by
means
of
the
material
employed
an
attempt
which
panders
to
this
evil
tendency
of
the
public
is
most
to
be
condemned
in
branches
of
literature
where
any
merit
there
may
be
lies
expressly
in
the
form
i
mean
in
poetical
work
for
all
that
it
is
not
rare
to
find
bad
dramatists
trying
to
fill
the
house
by
means
of
the
matter
about
which
they
write
for
example
authors
of
this
kind
do
not
shrink
from
putting
on
the
stage
any
man
who
is
in
any
way
celebrated
no
matter
whether
his
life
may
have
been
entirely
devoid
of
dramatic
incident
and
sometimes
even
they
do
not
wait
until
the
persons
immediately
connected
with
him
are
dead
the
distinction
between
matter
and
form
to
which
i
am
here
alluding
also
holds
good
of
conversation
the
chief
qualities
which
enable
a
man
to
converse
well
are
intelligence
discernment
wit
and
vivacity
these
supply
the
form
of
conversation
but
it
is
not
long
before
attention
has
to
be
paid
to
the
matter
of
which
he
speaks
in
other
words
the
subjects
about
which
it
is
possible
to
converse
with
him
his
knowledge
if
this
is
very
small
his
conversation
will
not
be
worth
anything
unless
he
possesses
the
formal
qualities
in
a
very
exceptional
degree
for
he
will
have
nothing
to
talk
about
but
those
facts
of
life
and
nature
which
everybody
knows
it
will
be
just
the
opposite
however
if
a
man
is
deficient
in
these
formal
qualities
but
has
an
amount
of
knowledge
which
lends
value
to
what
he
says
this
value
will
then
depend
entirely
upon
the
matter
of
his
conversation
for
as
the
spanish
proverb
has
it
sabe
el
necio
en
su
casa
que
el
sabio
en
la
a
fool
knows
more
of
his
own
business
than
a
wise
man
does
of
others
on
style
style
is
the
physiognomy
of
the
mind
and
a
safer
index
to
character
than
the
face
to
imitate
another
man
style
is
like
wearing
a
mask
which
be
it
never
so
fine
is
not
long
in
arousing
disgust
and
abhorrence
because
it
is
lifeless
so
that
even
the
ugliest
living
face
is
better
hence
those
who
write
in
latin
and
copy
the
manner
of
ancient
authors
may
be
said
to
speak
through
a
mask
the
reader
it
is
true
hears
what
they
say
but
he
can
not
observe
their
physiognomy
too
he
can
not
see
their
with
the
latin
works
of
writers
who
think
for
themselves
the
case
is
different
and
their
style
is
visible
writers
i
mean
who
have
not
condescended
to
any
sort
of
imitation
such
as
scotus
erigena
petrarch
bacon
descartes
spinoza
and
many
others
an
affectation
in
style
is
like
making
grimaces
further
the
language
in
which
a
man
writes
is
the
physiognomy
of
the
nation
to
which
he
belongs
and
here
there
are
many
hard
and
fast
differences
beginning
from
the
language
of
the
greeks
down
to
that
of
the
caribbean
islanders
to
form
a
provincial
estimate
of
the
value
of
a
writer
productions
it
is
not
directly
necessary
to
know
the
subject
on
which
he
has
thought
or
what
it
is
that
he
has
said
about
it
that
would
imply
a
perusal
of
all
his
works
it
will
be
enough
in
the
main
to
know
he
has
thought
this
which
means
the
essential
temper
or
general
quality
of
his
mind
may
be
precisely
determined
by
his
style
a
man
style
shows
the
nature
of
all
his
thoughts
the
formal
nature
which
can
never
change
be
the
subject
or
the
character
of
his
thoughts
what
it
may
it
is
as
it
were
the
dough
out
of
which
all
the
contents
of
his
mind
are
kneaded
when
eulenspiegel
was
asked
how
long
it
would
take
to
walk
to
the
next
village
he
gave
the
seemingly
incongruous
answer
he
wanted
to
find
out
by
the
man
pace
the
distance
he
would
cover
in
a
given
time
in
the
same
way
when
i
have
read
a
few
pages
of
an
author
i
know
fairly
well
how
far
he
can
bring
me
every
mediocre
writer
tries
to
mask
his
own
natural
style
because
in
his
heart
he
knows
the
truth
of
what
i
am
saying
he
is
thus
forced
at
the
outset
to
give
up
any
attempt
at
being
frank
or
naïve
a
privilege
which
is
thereby
reserved
for
superior
minds
conscious
of
their
own
worth
and
therefore
sure
of
themselves
what
i
mean
is
that
these
everyday
writers
are
absolutely
unable
to
resolve
upon
writing
just
as
they
think
because
they
have
a
notion
that
were
they
to
do
so
their
work
might
possibly
look
very
childish
and
simple
for
all
that
it
would
not
be
without
its
value
if
they
would
only
go
honestly
to
work
and
say
quite
simply
the
things
they
have
really
thought
and
just
as
they
have
thought
them
these
writers
would
be
readable
and
within
their
own
proper
sphere
even
instructive
but
instead
of
that
they
try
to
make
the
reader
believe
that
their
thoughts
have
gone
much
further
and
deeper
than
is
really
the
case
they
say
what
they
have
to
say
in
long
sentences
that
wind
about
in
a
forced
and
unnatural
way
they
coin
new
words
and
write
prolix
periods
which
go
round
and
round
the
thought
and
wrap
it
up
in
a
sort
of
disguise
they
tremble
between
the
two
separate
aims
of
communicating
what
they
want
to
say
and
of
concealing
it
their
object
is
to
dress
it
up
so
that
it
may
look
learned
or
deep
in
order
to
give
people
the
impression
that
there
is
very
much
more
in
it
than
for
the
moment
meets
the
eye
they
either
jot
down
their
thoughts
bit
by
bit
in
short
ambiguous
and
paradoxical
sentences
which
apparently
mean
much
more
than
they
say
of
this
kind
of
writing
treatises
on
natural
philosophy
are
a
splendid
instance
or
else
they
hold
forth
with
a
deluge
of
words
and
the
most
intolerable
diffusiveness
as
though
no
end
of
fuss
were
necessary
to
make
the
reader
understand
the
deep
meaning
of
their
sentences
whereas
it
is
some
quite
simple
if
not
actually
trivial
idea
examples
of
which
may
be
found
in
plenty
in
the
popular
works
of
fichte
and
the
philosophical
manuals
of
a
hundred
other
miserable
dunces
not
worth
mentioning
or
again
they
try
to
write
in
some
particular
style
which
they
have
been
pleased
to
take
up
and
think
very
grand
a
style
for
example
profound
and
scientific
where
the
reader
is
tormented
to
death
by
the
narcotic
effect
of
longspun
periods
without
a
single
idea
in
them
such
as
are
furnished
in
a
special
measure
by
those
most
impudent
of
all
mortals
the
hegelians
or
it
may
be
that
it
is
an
intellectual
style
they
have
striven
after
where
it
seems
as
though
their
object
were
to
go
crazy
altogether
and
so
on
in
many
other
cases
all
these
endeavors
to
put
off
the
ridiculus
to
avoid
showing
the
funny
little
creature
that
is
born
after
such
mighty
throes
often
make
it
difficult
to
know
what
it
is
that
they
really
mean
and
then
too
they
write
down
words
nay
even
whole
sentences
without
attaching
any
meaning
to
them
themselves
but
in
the
hope
that
someone
else
will
get
sense
out
of
them
footnote
in
their
commonly
known
as
der
wissenschaftlichen
and
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
nothing
but
the
untiring
effort
to
sell
words
for
thoughts
a
mode
of
merchandise
that
is
always
trying
to
make
fresh
openings
for
itself
and
by
means
of
odd
expressions
turns
of
phrase
and
combinations
of
every
sort
whether
new
or
used
in
a
new
sense
to
produce
the
appearence
of
intellect
in
order
to
make
up
for
the
very
painfully
felt
lack
of
it
it
is
amusing
to
see
how
writers
with
this
object
in
view
will
attempt
first
one
mannerism
and
then
another
as
though
they
were
putting
on
the
mask
of
intellect
this
mask
may
possibly
deceive
the
inexperienced
for
a
while
until
it
is
seen
to
be
a
dead
thing
with
no
life
in
it
at
all
it
is
then
laughed
at
and
exchanged
for
another
such
an
author
will
at
one
moment
write
in
a
dithyrambic
vein
as
though
he
were
tipsy
at
another
nay
on
the
very
next
page
he
will
be
pompous
severe
profoundly
learned
and
prolix
stumbling
on
in
the
most
cumbrous
way
and
chopping
up
everything
very
small
like
the
late
christian
wolf
only
in
a
modern
dress
longest
of
all
lasts
the
mask
of
unintelligibility
but
this
is
only
in
germany
whither
it
was
introduced
by
fichte
perfected
by
schelling
and
carried
to
its
highest
pitch
in
hegel
always
with
the
best
results
and
yet
nothing
is
easier
than
to
write
so
that
no
one
can
understand
just
as
contrarily
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
express
deep
things
in
such
a
way
that
every
one
must
necessarily
grasp
them
all
the
arts
and
tricks
i
have
been
mentioning
are
rendered
superfluous
if
the
author
really
has
any
brains
for
that
allows
him
to
show
himself
as
he
is
and
confirms
to
all
time
horace
maxim
that
good
sense
is
the
source
and
origin
of
good
style
recte
sapere
est
et
principium
et
but
those
authors
i
have
named
are
like
certain
workers
in
metal
who
try
a
hundred
different
compounds
to
take
the
place
of
gold
the
only
metal
which
can
never
have
any
substitute
rather
than
do
that
there
is
nothing
against
which
a
writer
should
be
more
upon
his
guard
than
the
manifest
endeavor
to
exhibit
more
intellect
than
he
really
has
because
this
makes
the
reader
suspect
that
he
possesses
very
little
since
it
is
always
the
case
that
if
a
man
affects
anything
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
just
there
that
he
is
deficient
that
is
why
it
is
praise
to
an
author
to
say
that
he
is
it
means
that
he
need
not
shrink
from
showing
himself
as
he
is
generally
speaking
to
be
is
to
be
attractive
while
lack
of
naturalness
is
everywhere
repulsive
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
find
that
every
really
great
writer
tries
to
express
his
thoughts
as
purely
clearly
definitely
and
shortly
as
possible
simplicity
has
always
been
held
to
be
a
mark
of
truth
it
is
also
a
mark
of
genius
style
receives
its
beauty
from
the
thought
it
expresses
but
with
the
thoughts
are
supposed
to
be
fine
because
of
the
style
style
is
nothing
but
the
mere
silhouette
of
thought
and
an
obscure
or
bad
style
means
a
dull
or
confused
brain
the
first
rule
then
for
a
good
style
is
that
author
should
have
something
to
nay
this
is
in
itself
almost
all
that
is
necessary
ah
how
much
it
means
the
neglect
of
this
rule
is
a
fundamental
trait
in
the
philosophical
writing
and
in
fact
in
all
the
reflective
literature
of
my
country
more
especially
since
fichte
these
writers
all
let
it
be
seen
that
they
want
to
appear
as
though
they
had
something
to
say
whereas
they
have
nothing
to
say
writing
of
this
kind
was
brought
in
by
the
at
the
universities
and
now
it
is
current
everywhere
even
among
the
first
literary
notabilities
of
the
age
it
is
the
mother
of
that
strained
and
vague
style
where
there
seem
to
be
two
or
even
more
meanings
in
the
sentence
also
of
that
prolix
and
cumbrous
manner
of
expression
called
stile
again
of
that
mere
waste
of
words
which
consists
in
pouring
them
out
like
a
flood
finally
of
that
trick
of
concealing
the
direst
poverty
of
thought
under
a
farrago
of
chatter
which
clacks
away
like
a
windmill
and
quite
stupefies
one
stuff
which
a
man
may
read
for
hours
together
without
getting
hold
of
a
single
clearly
expressed
and
definite
idea
however
people
are
and
they
have
formed
the
habit
of
reading
page
upon
page
of
all
sorts
of
such
verbiage
without
having
any
particular
idea
of
what
the
author
really
means
they
fancy
it
is
all
as
it
should
be
and
fail
to
discover
that
he
is
writing
simply
for
writing
sake
footnote
select
examples
of
the
art
of
writing
in
this
style
are
to
be
found
almost
in
the
published
at
halle
afterwards
called
the
on
the
other
hand
a
good
author
fertile
in
ideas
soon
wins
his
reader
confidence
that
when
he
writes
he
has
really
and
truly
to
and
this
gives
the
intelligent
reader
patience
to
follow
him
with
attention
such
an
author
just
because
he
really
has
something
to
say
will
never
fail
to
express
himself
in
the
simplest
and
most
straightforward
manner
because
his
object
is
to
awake
the
very
same
thought
in
the
reader
that
he
has
in
himself
and
no
other
so
he
will
be
able
to
affirm
with
boileau
that
his
thoughts
are
everywhere
open
to
the
light
of
the
day
and
that
his
verse
always
says
something
whether
it
says
it
well
or
ill
pensée
au
grand
jour
partout
et
et
mon
vers
bien
ou
mal
dit
toujours
quelque
while
of
the
writers
previously
described
it
may
be
asserted
in
the
words
of
the
same
poet
that
they
talk
much
and
never
say
anything
at
all
beaucoup
ne
disent
jamais
another
characteristic
of
such
writers
is
that
they
always
avoid
a
positive
assertion
wherever
they
can
possibly
do
so
in
order
to
leave
a
loophole
for
escape
in
case
of
need
hence
they
never
fail
to
choose
the
more
way
of
expressing
themselves
whereas
intelligent
people
use
the
more
because
the
latter
brings
things
more
within
the
range
of
actual
demonstration
which
is
the
source
of
all
evidence
there
are
many
examples
proving
this
preference
for
abstract
expression
and
a
particularly
ridiculous
one
is
afforded
by
the
use
of
the
verb
in
the
sense
of
or
people
say
condition
instead
of
cause
because
being
abstract
and
indefinite
it
says
less
it
affirms
that
can
not
happen
without
instead
of
that
is
caused
by
a
back
door
is
always
left
open
and
this
suits
people
whose
secret
knowledge
of
their
own
incapacity
inspires
them
with
a
perpetual
terror
of
all
positive
assertion
while
with
other
people
it
is
merely
the
effect
of
that
tendency
by
which
everything
that
is
stupid
in
literature
or
bad
in
life
is
immediately
imitated
a
fact
proved
in
either
case
by
the
rapid
way
in
which
it
spreads
the
englishman
uses
his
own
judgment
in
what
he
writes
as
well
as
in
what
he
does
but
there
is
no
nation
of
which
this
eulogy
is
less
true
than
of
the
germans
the
consequence
of
this
state
of
things
is
that
the
word
has
of
late
almost
disappeared
from
the
language
of
literature
and
people
talk
only
of
the
fact
is
worth
mentioning
because
it
is
so
characteristically
ridiculous
the
very
fact
that
these
commonplace
authors
are
never
more
than
when
they
write
would
be
enough
to
account
for
their
dullness
of
mind
and
the
tedious
things
they
produce
i
say
they
are
only
because
they
really
do
not
themselves
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
use
they
take
words
and
commit
them
to
memory
hence
when
they
write
it
is
not
so
much
words
as
whole
phrases
that
they
put
together
this
is
the
explanation
of
that
palpable
lack
of
thought
in
what
they
say
the
fact
is
that
they
do
not
possess
the
die
to
give
this
stamp
to
their
writing
clear
thought
of
their
own
is
just
what
they
have
not
got
and
what
do
we
find
in
its
place
a
vague
enigmatical
intermixture
of
words
current
phrases
hackneyed
terms
and
fashionable
expressions
the
result
is
that
the
foggy
stuff
they
write
is
like
a
page
printed
with
very
old
type
on
the
other
hand
an
intelligent
author
really
speaks
to
us
when
he
writes
and
that
is
why
he
is
able
to
rouse
our
interest
and
commune
with
us
it
is
the
intelligent
author
alone
who
puts
individual
words
together
with
a
full
consciousness
of
their
meaning
and
chooses
them
with
deliberate
design
consequently
his
discourse
stands
to
that
of
the
writer
described
above
much
as
a
picture
that
has
been
really
painted
to
one
that
has
been
produced
by
the
use
of
a
stencil
in
the
one
case
every
word
every
touch
of
the
brush
has
a
special
purpose
in
the
other
all
is
done
mechanically
the
same
distinction
may
be
observed
in
music
for
just
as
lichtenberg
says
that
garrick
soul
seemed
to
be
in
every
muscle
in
his
body
so
it
is
the
omnipresence
of
intellect
that
always
and
everywhere
characterizes
the
work
of
genius
i
have
alluded
to
the
tediousness
which
marks
the
works
of
these
writers
and
in
this
connection
it
is
to
be
observed
generally
that
tediousness
is
of
two
kinds
objective
and
subjective
a
work
is
objectively
tedious
when
it
contains
the
defect
in
question
that
is
to
say
when
its
author
has
no
perfectly
clear
thought
or
knowledge
to
communicate
for
if
a
man
has
any
clear
thought
or
knowledge
in
him
his
aim
will
be
to
communicate
it
and
he
will
direct
his
energies
to
this
end
so
that
the
ideas
he
furnishes
are
everywhere
clearly
expressed
the
result
is
that
he
is
neither
diffuse
nor
unmeaning
nor
confused
and
consequently
not
tedious
in
such
a
case
even
though
the
author
is
at
bottom
in
error
the
error
is
at
any
rate
clearly
worked
out
and
well
thought
over
so
that
it
is
at
least
formally
correct
and
thus
some
value
always
attaches
to
the
work
but
for
the
same
reason
a
work
that
is
objectively
tedious
is
at
all
times
devoid
of
any
value
whatever
the
other
kind
of
tediousness
is
only
relative
a
reader
may
find
a
work
dull
because
he
has
no
interest
in
the
question
treated
of
in
it
and
this
means
that
his
intellect
is
restricted
the
best
work
may
therefore
be
tedious
subjectively
tedious
i
mean
to
this
or
that
particular
person
just
as
contrarity
the
worst
work
may
be
subjectively
engrossing
to
this
or
that
particular
person
who
has
an
interest
in
the
question
treated
of
or
in
the
writer
of
the
book
it
would
generally
serve
writers
in
good
stead
if
they
would
see
that
whilst
a
man
should
if
possible
think
like
a
great
genius
he
should
talk
the
same
language
as
everyone
else
authors
should
use
common
words
to
say
uncommon
things
but
they
do
just
the
opposite
we
find
them
trying
to
wrap
up
trivial
ideas
in
grand
words
and
to
clothe
their
very
ordinary
thoughts
in
the
most
extraordinary
phrases
the
most
unnatural
and
expressions
their
sentences
perpetually
stalk
about
on
stilts
they
take
so
much
pleasure
in
bombast
and
write
in
such
a
bloated
affected
hyperbolical
and
acrobatic
style
that
their
prototype
is
ancient
pistol
whom
his
friend
falstaff
once
impatiently
told
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
a

there
is
no

exactly
answering

but
the
thing
itself
exists
all
the
more
often
when
associated
with
affectation
it
is
in
literature
what
assumption
of
dignity
grand
airs
and
primeness
are
in
society
and
equally
intolerable
dullness
of
mind
is
fond
of
donning
this
dress
just
as
an
ordinary
life
it
is
stupid
people
who
like
being
demure
and
formal
an
author
who
writes
in
the
prim
style
resembles
a
man
who
dresses
himself
up
in
order
to
avoid
being
confounded
or
put
on
the
same
level
with
a
mob
a
risk
never
run
by
the
even
in

the
plebeian
may
be
known
by
a
certain
showiness
of
attire
and
a
wish
to
have
everything
spick
and
span
and
in
the
same
way
the
commonplace
person
is
betrayed
by
his
style
nevertheless
an
author
follows
a
false
aim
if
he
tries
to
write
exactly
as
he
speaks
there
is
no
style
of
writing
but
should
have
a
certain
trace
of
kinship
with
the
or
style
which
is
indeed
the
ancestor
of
all
styles
for
an
author
to
write
as
he
speaks
is
just
as
reprehensible
as
the
opposite
fault
to
speak
as
he
writes
for
this
gives
a
pedantic
effect
to
what
he
says
and
at
the
same
time
makes
him
hardly
intelligible
an
obscure
and
vague
manner
of
expression
is
always
and
everywhere
a
very
bad
sign
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
it
comes
from
vagueness
of
thought
and
this
again
almost
always
means
that
there
is
something
radically
wrong
and
incongruous
about
the
thought
itself
in
a
word
that
it
is
incorrect
when
a
right
thought
springs
up
in
the
mind
it
strives
after
expression
and
is
not
long
in
reaching
it
for
clear
thought
easily
finds
words
to
fit
it
if
a
man
is
capable
of
thinking
anything
at
all
he
is
also
always
able
to
express
it
in
clear
intelligible
and
unambiguous
terms
those
writers
who
construct
difficult
obscure
involved
and
equivocal
sentences
most
certainly
do
not
know
aright
what
it
is
that
they
want
to
say
they
have
only
a
dull
consciousness
of
it
which
is
still
in
the
stage
of
struggle
to
shape
itself
as
thought
often
indeed
their
desire
is
to
conceal
from
themselves
and
others
that
they
really
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
they
wish
to
appear
to
know
what
they
do
not
know
to
think
what
they
do
not
think
to
say
what
they
do
not
say
if
a
man
has
some
real
communication
to
make
which
will
he
choose
an
indistinct
or
a
clear
way
of
expressing
himself
even
quintilian
remarks
that
things
which
are
said
by
a
highly
educated
man
are
often
easier
to
understand
and
much
clearer
and
that
the
less
educated
a
man
is
the
more
obscurely
he
will
write

lucidiora

an
author
should
avoid
enigmatical
phrases
he
should
know
whether
he
wants
to
say
a
thing
or
does
not
want
to
say
it
it
is
this
indecision
of
style
that
makes
so
many
writers
insipid
the
only
case
that
offers
an
exception
to
this
rule
arises
when
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
remark
that
is
in
some
way
improper
as
exaggeration
generally
produces
an
effect
the
opposite
of
that
aimed
at
so
words
it
is
true
serve
to
make
thought
intelligible
but
only
up
to
a
certain
point
if
words
are
heaped
up
beyond
it
the
thought
becomes
more
and
more
obscure
again
to
find
where
the
point
lies
is
the
problem
of
style
and
the
business
of
the
critical
faculty
for
a
word
too
much
always
defeats
its
purpose
this
is
what
voltaire
means
when
he
says
that
adjective
is
the
enemy
of
the
but
as
we
have
seen
many
people
try
to
conceal
their
poverty
of
thought
under
a
flood
of
verbiage
accordingly
let
all
redundancy
be
avoided
all
stringing
together
of
remarks
which
have
no
meaning
and
are
not
worth
perusal
a
writer
must
make
a
sparing
use
of
the
reader
time
patience
and
attention
so
as
to
lead
him
to
believe
that
his
author
writes
what
is
worth
careful
study
and
will
reward
the
time
spent
upon
it
it
is
always
better
to
omit
something
good
than
to
add
that
which
is
not
worth
saying

all

the

and

beautiful
undraped
and
the
impression
it

deep
in

its

is
so
partly
because
it
then
takes
unobstructed

leaves
him

also
because

that
all
the

so
in

a

must
guard
against
all
rhetorical
finery
all
useless
amplification
and
all
superfluity
of
expression
in

in
a
word

must
strive
after

every

if

for
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
at

true
brevity
of

consists
in
everywhere
saying
only
what
is
worth
saying
and
in
avoiding
tedious
detail
about
things
which
everyone
can
supply
for
himself
this
involves
correct
discrimination
between
what
it
necessary
and
what
is
superfluous
a
writer
should
never
be
brief
at
the
expense
of
being
clear
to
say
nothing
of
being
grammatical
it
shows
lamentable
want
of
judgment
to
weaken
the
expression
of
a
thought
or
to
stunt
the
meaning
of
a
period
for
the
sake
of
using
a
few
words
less
but
this
is
the
precise
endeavor
of
that
false
brevity
nowadays
so
much
in
vogue
which
proceeds
by
leaving
out
useful
words
and
even
by
sacrificing
grammar
and
logic
it
is
not
only
that
such
writers
spare
a
word
by
making
a
single
verb
or
adjective
do
duty
for
several
different
periods
so
that
the
reader
as
it
were
has
to
grope
his
way
through
them
in
the
dark
they
also
practice
in
many
other
respects
an
unseemingly
economy
of
speech
in
the
effort
to
effect
what
they
foolishly
take
to
be
brevity
of
expression
and
conciseness
of
style
by
omitting
something
that
might
have
thrown
a
light
over
the
whole
sentence
they
turn
it
into
a
conundrum
which
the

tries
to
solve

going
over
it
again

footnote
in
the
original
schopenhauer
here
enters
upon
a
lengthy
examination
of
certain
common
errors
in
the
writing
and
speaking
of
german
his
remarks
are
addressed
to
his
own
countrymen
and
would
lose
all
point
even
if
they
were
intelligible
in
an
english
translation
but
for
those
who
practice
their
german
by
conversing
or
corresponding
with
germans
let
me
recommend
what
he
there
says
as
a
useful
corrective
to
a
slipshod
style
such
as
can
easily
be
contracted
if
it
is
assumed
that
the
natives
of
a
country
always
know
their
own
language
perfectly
it
is
wealth
and
weight
of
thought
and
nothing
else
that
gives
brevity
to
style
and
makes
it
concise
and
pregnant
if
a
ideas
are
important
luminous
and
generally
worth
communicating
they
will
necessarily
furnish
matter
and
substance
enough
to
fill
out
the
periods
which
give
them
expression
and
make
these
in
all
their
parts
both
grammatically
and
verbally
complete
and
so
much
will
this
be
the
case
that
no
one
will
ever
find
them
hollow
empty
or
feeble
the
diction
will
everywhere
be
brief
and
pregnant
and
allow
the
thought
to
find
intelligible
and
easy
expression
and
even
unfold
and
move
about
with
grace
therefore
instead
of
contracting
his
words
and
forms
of
speech
let
a
writer
enlarge
his
thoughts
if
a
man
has
been
thinned
by
illness
and
finds
his
clothes
too
big
it
is
not
by
cutting
them
down
but
by
recovering
his
usual
bodily
condition
that
he
ought
to
make
them
fit
him
again
let
me
here
mention
an
error
of
style
very
prevalent
nowadays
and
in
the
degraded
state
of
literature
and
the
neglect
of
ancient
languages
always
on
the
increase
i
mean
a
writer
commits
this
error
when
he
thinks
it
enough
if
he
himself
knows
what
he
means
and
wants
to
say
and
takes
no
thought
for
the
reader
who
is
left
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
best
he
can
this
is
as
though
the
author
were
holding
a
monologue
whereas
it
ought
to
be
a
dialogue
and
a
dialogue
too
in
which
he
must
express
himself
all
the
more
clearly
inasmuch
as
he
can
not
hear
the
questions
of
his
interlocutor
style
should
for
this
very
reason
never
be
subjective
but
and
it
will
not
be
objective
unless
the
words
are
so
set
down
that
they
directly
force
the
reader
to
think
precisely
the
same
thing
as
the
author
thought
when
he
wrote
them
nor
will
this
result
be
obtained
unless
the
author
has
always
been
careful
to
remember
that
thought
so
far
follows
the
law
of
gravity
that
it
travels
from
head
to
paper
much
more
easily
than
from
paper
to
head
so
that
he
must
assist
the
latter
passage
by
every
means
in
his
power
if
he
does
this
a
writer
words
will
have
a
purely
objective
effect
like
that
of
a
finished
picture
in
oils
whilst
the
subjective
style
is
not
much
more
certain
in
its
working
than
spots
on
the
wall
which
look
like
figures
only
to
one
whose
phantasy
has
been
accidentally
aroused
by
them
other
people
see
nothing
but
spots
and
blurs
the
difference
in
question
applies
to
literary
method
as
a
whole
but
it
is
often
established
also
in
particular
instances
for
example
in
a
recently
published
work
i
found
the
following
sentence
have
not
written
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
existing
this
means
just
the
opposite
of
what
the
writer
wanted
to
say
and
is
nonsense
as
well
he
who
writes
carelessly
confesses
thereby
at
the
very
outset
that
he
does
not
attach
much
importance
to
his
own
thoughts
for
it
is
only
where
a
man
is
convinced
of
the
truth
and
importance
of
his
thoughts
that
he
feels
the
enthusiasm
necessary
for
an
untiring
and
assiduous
effort
to
find
the
clearest
finest
and
strongest
expression
for
them
just
as
for
sacred
relics
or
priceless
works
of
art
there
are
provided
silvern
or
golden
receptacles
it
was
this
feeling
that
led
ancient
authors
whose
thoughts
expressed
in
their
own
words
have
lived
thousands
of
years
and
therefore
bear
the
honored
title
of
always
to
write
with
care
plato
indeed
is
said
to
have
written
the
introduction
to
his
seven
times
over
in
different
ways
footnote
it
is
a
fact
worth
mentioning
that
the
first
twelve
words
of
the
are
placed
in
the
exact
order
which
would
be
natural
in
english
as
neglect
of
dress
betrays
want
of
respect
for
the
company
a
man
meets
so
a
hasty
careless
bad
style
shows
an
outrageous
lack
of
regard
for
the
reader
who
then
rightly
punishes
it
by
refusing
to
read
the
book
it
is
especially
amusing
to
see
reviewers
criticising
the
works
of
others
in
their
own
most
careless
style
the
style
of
a
hireling
it
is
as
though
a
judge
were
to
come
into
court
in
and
slippers
if
i
see
a
man
badly
and
dirtily
dressed
i
feel
some
hesitation
at
first
in
entering
into
conversation
with
him
and
when
on
taking
up
a
book
i
am
struck
at
once
by
the
negligence
of
its
style
i
put
it
away
good
writing
should
be
governed
by
the
rule
that
a
man
can
think
only
one
thing
clearly
at
a
time
and
therefore
that
he
should
not
be
expected
to
think
two
or
even
more
things
in
one
and
the
same
moment
but
this
is
what
is
done
when
a
writer
breaks
up
his
principal
sentence
into
little
pieces
for
the
purpose
of
pushing
into
the
gaps
thus
made
two
or
three
other
thoughts
by
way
of
parenthesis
thereby
unnecessarily
and
wantonly
confusing
the
reader
and
here
it
is
again
my
own
countrymen
who
are
chiefly
in
fault
that
german
lends
itself
to
this
way
of
writing
makes
the
thing
possible
but
does
not
justify
it
no
prose
reads
more
easily
or
pleasantly
than
french
because
as
a
rule
it
is
free
from
the
error
in
question
the
frenchman
strings
his
thoughts
together
as
far
as
he
can
in
the
most
logical
and
natural
order
and
so
lays
them
before
his
reader
one
after
the
other
for
convenient
deliberation
so
that
every
one
of
them
may
receive
undivided
attention
the
german
on
the
other
hand
weaves
them
together
into
a
sentence
which
he
twists
and
crosses
and
crosses
and
twists
again
because
he
wants
to
say
six
things
all
at
once
instead
of
advancing
them
one
by
one
his
aim
should
be
to
attract
and
hold
the
reader
attention
but
above
and
beyond
neglect
of
this
aim
he
demands
from
the
reader
that
he
shall
set
the
above
mentioned
rule
at
defiance
and
think
three
or
four
different
thoughts
at
one
and
the
same
time
or
since
that
is
impossible
that
his
thoughts
shall
succeed
each
other
as
quickly
as
the
vibrations
of
a
cord
in
this
way
an
author
lays
the
foundation
of
his
which
is
then
carried
to
perfection
by
the
use
of
pompous
expressions
to
communicate
the
simplest
things
and
other
artifices
of
the
same
kind
in
those
long
sentences
rich
in
involved
parenthesis
like
a
box
of
boxes
one
within
another
and
padded
out
like
roast
geese
stuffed
with
apples
it
is
really
the
that
is
chiefly
taxed
while
it
is
the
understanding
and
the
judgment
which
should
be
called
into
play
instead
of
having
their
activity
thereby
actually
hindered
and
weakened
this
kind
of
sentence
furnishes
the
reader
with
mere
which
he
is
then
called
upon
to
collect
carefully
and
store
up
in
his
memory
as
though
they
were
the
pieces
of
a
torn
letter
afterwards
to
be
completed
and
made
sense
of
by
the
other
halves
to
which
they
respectively
belong
he
is
expected
to
go
on
reading
for
a
little
without
exercising
any
thought
nay
exerting
only
his
memory
in
the
hope
that
when
he
comes
to
the
end
of
the
sentence
he
may
see
its
meaning
and
so
receive
something
to
think
about
and
he
is
thus
given
a
great
deal
to
learn
by
heart
before
obtaining
anything
to
understand
this
is
manifestly
wrong
and
an
abuse
of
the
reader
patience
footnote
this
sentence
in
the
original
is
obviously
meant
to
illustrate
the
fault
of
which
it
speaks
it
does
so
by
the
use
of
a
construction
very
common
in
german
but
happily
unknown
in
english
where
however
the
fault
itself
exists
none
the
less
though
in
different
form
the
ordinary
writer
has
an
unmistakable
preference
for
this
style
because
it
causes
the
reader
to
spend
time
and
trouble
in
understanding
that
which
he
would
have
understood
in
a
moment
without
it
and
this
makes
it
look
as
though
the
writer
had
more
depth
and
intelligence
than
the
reader
this
is
indeed
one
of
those
artifices
referred
to
above
by
means
of
which
mediocre
authors
unconsciously
and
as
it
were
by
instinct
strive
to
conceal
their
poverty
of
thought
and
give
an
appearance
of
the
opposite
their
ingenuity
in
this
respect
is
really
astounding
it
is
manifestly
against
all
sound
reason
to
put
one
thought
obliquely
on
top
of
another
as
though
both
together
formed
a
wooden
cross
but
this
is
what
is
done
where
a
writer
interrupts
what
he
has
begun
to
say
for
the
purpose
of
inserting
some
quite
alien
matter
thus
depositing
with
the
reader
a
meaningless
and
bidding
him
keep
it
until
the
completion
comes
it
is
much
as
though
a
man
were
to
treat
his
guests
by
handing
them
an
empty
plate
in
the
hope
of
something
appearing
upon
it
and
commas
used
for
a
similar
purpose
belong
to
the
same
family
as
notes
at
the
foot
of
the
page
and
parenthesis
in
the
middle
of
the
text
nay
all
three
differ
only
in
degree
if
demosthenes
and
cicero
occasionally
inserted
words
by
ways
of
parenthesis
they
would
have
done
better
to
have
refrained
but
this
style
of
writing
becomes
the
height
of
absurdity
when
the
parenthesis
are
not
even
fitted
into
the
frame
of
the
sentence
but
wedged
in
so
as
directly
to
shatter
it
if
for
instance
it
is
an
impertinent
thing
to
interrupt
another
person
when
he
is
speaking
it
is
no
less
impertinent
to
interrupt
oneself
but
all
bad
careless
and
hasty
authors
who
scribble
with
the
bread
actually
before
their
eyes
use
this
style
of
writing
six
times
on
a
page
and
rejoice
in
it
it
consists
in
it
is
advisable
to
give
rule
and
example
together
wherever
it
is
possible
breaking
up
one
phrase
in
order
to
glue
in
another
nor
is
it
merely
out
of
laziness
that
they
write
thus
they
do
it
out
of
stupidity
they
think
there
is
a
charming
about
it
that
it
gives
life
to
what
they
say
no
doubt
there
are
a
few
rare
cases
where
such
a
form
of
sentence
may
be
pardonable
few
write
in
the
way
in
which
an
architect
builds
who
before
he
sets
to
work
sketches
out
his
plan
and
thinks
it
over
down
to
its
smallest
details
nay
most
people
write
only
as
though
they
were
playing
dominoes
and
as
in
this
game
the
pieces
are
arranged
half
by
design
half
by
chance
so
it
is
with
the
sequence
and
connection
of
their
sentences
they
only
have
an
idea
of
what
the
general
shape
of
their
work
will
be
and
of
the
aim
they
set
before
themselves
many
are
ignorant
even
of
this
and
write
as
the
build
period
joins
to
period
and
the
lord
only
knows
what
the
author
means
life
goes
at
a
gallop
and
the
way
in
which
this
affects
literature
is
to
make
it
extremely
superficial
and
slovenly
on
the
study
of
latin
the
abolition
of
latin
as
the
universal
language
of
learned
men
together
with
the
rise
of
that
provincialism
which
attaches
to
national
literatures
has
been
a
real
misfortune
for
the
cause
of
knowledge
in
europe
for
it
was
chiefly
through
the
medium
of
the
latin
language
that
a
learned
public
existed
in
europe
at
all
a
public
to
which
every
book
as
it
came
out
directly
appealed
the
number
of
minds
in
the
whole
of
europe
that
are
capable
of
thinking
and
judging
is
small
as
it
is
but
when
the
audience
is
broken
up
and
severed
by
differences
of
language
the
good
these
minds
can
do
is
very
much
weakened
this
is
a
great
disadvantage
but
a
second
and
worse
one
will
follow
namely
that
the
ancient
languages
will
cease
to
be
taught
at
all
the
neglect
of
them
is
rapidly
gaining
ground
both
in
france
and
germany
if
it
should
really
come
to
this
then
farewell
humanity
farewell
noble
taste
and
high
thinking
the
age
of
barbarism
will
return
in
spite
of
railways
telegraphs
and
balloons
we
shall
thus
in
the
end
lose
one
more
advantage
possessed
by
all
our
ancestors

latin

not
only
a
key
to
the
knowledge
of
roman
antiquity

also
directly
opens
up
to
us
the
middle
age

every
country

naturally
adopted

of
learned
matters

close
to
us

at
this
distance
of
time

are
in
direct
contact
with
them
and
really
come
to
know
them
how
would
it
have
been
if
every
one
of
them
spoke
in
the
language
that
was
peculiar
to
his
time
and

we
should
not
understand
even
the
half
of
what
they
said
a
real
intellectual
contact
with

be

should

let
me
observe
by
way
of
parenthesis
that
when
patriotism

an
offence
which
should
not
be
tolerated

questions
which
interest
all

where
truth

should
be

can

than
to
let
preference
for

which
a
man
precious

the
balance
of
judgment
and
thus
supply
a
reason

doing
violence

unjust
to

of

in
order
to
make
much
of
the
smaller

of
one
own
still
there
are
writers
in
every
nation
in
europe
who
afford
examples
of
this
vulgar
feeling
it
is
this
which
led
yriarte
to
caricature
them
in
the
of
his
charming
footnote
tomas

poet
and
keeper
of

didactic
poem
entitled
and
the
here
quoted
which
satirize
the
peculiar
foibles
of
literary
men
they
have
been
translated
into
many
languages
into
english
by
rockliffe
edition
the
fable
in

describes
how
at
a
picnic
of
the
animals
a
discussion
arose
as
to
which
of
them
carried
off
the
palm
for
superiority
of
talent
the
praises
of
the
ant
the
dog
the
bee
and
the
parrot
were
sung
in
turn
but
at
last
the
ostrich
stood
up
and
declared
for
the
dromedary
whereupon
the
dromedary
stood
up
and
declared
for
the
ostrich
no
one
could
discover
the
reason
for
this
mutual
compliment
was
it
because
both
were
such
uncouth
beasts
or
had
such
long
necks
or
were
neither
of
them
particularly
clever
or
beautiful
or
was
it
because
each
had
a
hump
said
the
fox
are
all
wrong
do
you
see
they
are
both
can
not
the
same
be
said
of
many
men
of
learning
in
learning
a
language
the
chief
difficulty
consists
in
making
acquaintance
with
every
idea
which
it
expresses
even
though
it
should
use
words
for
which
there
is
no
exact
equivalent
in
the
mother
tongue
and
this
often
happens
in
learning
a
new
language
a
man
has
as
it
were
to
mark
out
in
his
mind
the
boundaries
of
quite
new
spheres
of
ideas
with
the
result
that
spheres
of
ideas
arise
where
none
were
before
thus
he
not
only
learns
words
he
gains
ideas
too
this
is
nowhere
so
much
the
case
as
in
learning
ancient
languages
for
the
differences
they
present
in
their
mode
of
expression
as
compared
with
modern
languages
is
greater
than
can
be
found
amongst
modern
languages
as
compared
with
one
another
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
translating
into
latin
recourse
must
be
had
to
quite
other
turns
of
phrase
than
are
used
in
the
original
the
thought
that
is
to
be
translated
has
to
be
melted
down
and
recast
in
other
words
it
must
be
analyzed
and
then
recomposed
it
is
just
this
process
which
makes
the
study
of
the
ancient
languages
contribute
so
much
to
the
education
of
the
mind
it
follows
from
this
that
a
man
thought
varies
according
to
the
language
in
which
he
speaks
his
ideas
undergo
a
fresh
modification
a
different
shading
as
it
were
in
the
study
of
every
new
language
hence
an
acquaintance
with
many
languages
is
not
only
of
much
indirect
advantage
but
it
is
also
a
direct
means
of
mental
culture
in
that
it
corrects
and
matures
ideas
by
giving
prominence
to
their
nature
and
their
different
varieties
of
meaning
as
also
that
it
increases
dexterity
of
thought
for
in
the
process
of
learning
many
languages
ideas
become
more
and
more
independent
of
words
the
ancient
languages
effect
this
to
a
greater
degree
than
the
modern
in
virtue
of
the
difference
to
which
i
have
alluded
from
what
i
have
said
it
is
obvious
that
to
imitate
the
style
of
the
ancients
in
their
own
language
which
is
so
very
much
superior
to
ours
in
point
of
grammatical
perfection
is
the
best
way
of
preparing
for
a
skillful
and
finished
expression
of
thought
in
the
nay
if
a
man
wants
to
be
a
great
writer
he
must
not
omit
to
do
this
just
as
in
the
case
of
sculpture
or
painting
the
student
must
educate
himself
by
copying
the
great
masterpieces
of
the
past
before
proceeding
to
original
work
it
is
only
by
learning
to
write
latin
that
a
man
comes
to
treat
diction
as
an
art
the
material
in
this
art
is
language
which
must
therefore
be
handled
with
the
greatest
care
and
delicacy
the
result
of
such
study
is
that
a
writer
will
pay
keen
attention
to
the
meaning
and
value
of
words
their
order
and
connection
their
grammatical
forms
he
will
learn
how
to
weigh
them
with
precision
and
so
become
an
expert
in
the
use
of
that
precious
instrument
which
is
meant
not
only
to
express
valuable
thought
but
to
preserve
it
as
well
further
he
will
learn
to
feel
respect
for
the
language
in
which
he
writes
and
thus
be
saved
from
any
attempt
to
remodel
it
by
arbitrary
and
capricious
treatment
without
this
schooling
a
writing
may
easily
degenerate
into
mere
chatter
to
be
entirely
ignorant
of
the
latin
language
is
like
being
in
a
fine
country
on
a
misty
day
the
horizon
is
extremely
limited
nothing
can
be
seen
clearly
except
that
which
is
quite
close
a
few
steps
beyond
everything
is
buried
in
obscurity
but
the
latinist
has
a
wide
view
embracing
modern
times
the
middle
age
and
antiquity
and
his
mental
horizon
is
still
further
enlarged
if
he
studies
greek
or
even
sanscrit
if
a
man
knows
no
latin
he
belongs
to
the
vulgar
even
though
he
be
a
great
virtuoso
on
the
electrical
machine
and
have
the
base
of
hydrofluoric
acid
in
his
crucible
there
is
no
better
recreation
for
the
mind
than
the
study
of
the
ancient
classics
take
any
one
of
them
into
your
hand
be
it
only
for
half
an
hour
and
you
will
feel
yourself
refreshed
relieved
purified
ennobled
strengthened
just
as
though
you
had
quenched
your
thirst
at
some
pure
spring
is
this
the
effect
of
the
old
language
and
its
perfect
expression
or
is
it
the
greatness
of
the
minds
whose
works
remain
unharmed
and
unweakened
by
the
lapse
of
a
thousand
years
perhaps
both
together
but
this
i
know
if
the
threatened
calamity
should
ever
come
and
the
ancient
languages
cease
to
be
taught
a
new
literature
will
arise
of
such
barbarous
shallow
and
worthless
stuff
as
never
was
seen
before
on
men
of
learning
when
one
sees
the
number
and
variety
of
institutions
which
exist
for
the
purposes
of
education
and
the
vast
throng
of
scholars
and
masters
one
might
fancy
the
human
race
to
be
very
much
concerned
about
truth
and
wisdom
but
here
too
appearances
are
deceptive
the
masters
teach
in
order
to
gain
money
and
strive
not
after
wisdom
but
the
outward
show
and
reputation
of
it
and
the
scholars
learn
not
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
and
insight
but
to
be
able
to
chatter
and
give
themselves
airs
every
thirty
years
a
new
race
comes
into
the
world
a
youngster
that
knows
nothing
about
anything
and
after
summarily
devouring
in
all
haste
the
results
of
human
knowledge
as
they
have
been
accumulated
for
thousands
of
years
aspires
to
be
thought
cleverer
than
the
whole
of
the
past
for
this
purpose
he
goes
to
the
university
and
takes
to
reading
books
new
books
as
being
of
his
own
age
and
standing
everything
he
reads
must
be
briefly
put
must
be
new
he
is
new
himself
then
he
falls
to
and
criticises
and
here
i
am
not
taking
the
slightest
account
of
studies
pursued
for
the
sole
object
of
making
a
living
students
and
learned
persons
of
all
sorts
and
every
age
aim
as
a
rule
at
acquiring
rather
than
insight
they
pique
themselves
upon
knowing
about
everything
stones
plants
battles
experiments
and
all
the
books
in
existence
it
never
occurs
to
them
that
information
is
only
a
means
of
insight
and
in
itself
of
little
or
no
value
that
it
is
his
way
of
that
makes
a
man
a
philosopher
when
i
hear
of
these
portents
of
learning
and
their
imposing
erudition
i
sometimes
say
to
myself
ah
how
little
they
must
have
had
to
think
about
to
have
been
able
to
read
so
much
and
when
i
actually
find
it
reported
of
the
elder
pliny
that
he
was
continually
reading
or
being
read
to
at
table
on
a
journey
or
in
his
bath
the
question
forces
itself
upon
my
mind
whether
the
man
was
so
very
lacking
in
thought
of
his
own
that
he
had
to
have
alien
thought
incessantly
instilled
into
him
as
though
he
were
a
consumptive
patient
taking
jellies
to
keep
himself
alive
and
neither
his
undiscerning
credulity
nor
his
inexpressibly
repulsive
and
barely
intelligible
style
which
seems
like
of
a
man
taking
notes
and
very
economical
of
paper
is
of
a
kind
to
give
me
a
high
opinion
of
his
power
of
independent
thought
we
have
seen
that
much
reading
and
learning
is
prejudicial
to
thinking
for
oneself
and
in
the
same
way
through
much
writing
and
teaching
a
man
loses
the
habit
of
being
quite
clear
and
therefore
thorough
in
regard
to
the
things
he
knows
and
understands
simply
because
he
has
left
himself
no
time
to
acquire
clearness
or
thoroughness
and
so
when
clear
knowledge
fails
him
in
his
utterances
he
is
forced
to
fill
out
the
gaps
with
words
and
phrases
it
is
this
and
not
the
dryness
of
the
that
makes
most
books
such
tedious
reading
there
is
a
saying
that
a
good
cook
can
make
a
palatable
dish
even
out
of
an
old
shoe
and
a
good
writer
can
make
the
dryest
things
interesting
with
by
far
the
largest
number
of
learned
men
knowledge
is
a
means
not
an
end
that
is
why
they
will
never
achieve
any
great
work
because
to
do
that
he
who
pursues
knowledge
must
pursue
it
as
an
end
and
treat
everything
else
even
existence
itself
as
only
a
means
for
everything
which
a
man
fails
to
pursue
for
its
own
sake
is
but
and
true
excellence
no
matter
in
what
sphere
can
be
attained
only
where
the
work
has
been
produced
for
its
own
sake
alone
and
not
as
a
means
to
further
ends
and
so
too
no
one
will
ever
succeed
in
doing
anything
really
great
and
original
in
the
way
of
thought
who
does
not
seek
to
acquire
knowledge
for
himself
and
making
this
the
immediate
object
of
his
studies
decline
to
trouble
himself
about
the
knowledge
of
others
but
the
average
man
of
learning
studies
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
teach
and
write
his
head
is
like
a
stomach
and
intestines
which
let
the
food
pass
through
them
undigested
that
is
just
why
his
teaching
and
writing
is
of
so
little
use
for
it
is
not
upon
undigested
refuse
that
people
can
be
nourished
but
solely
upon
the
milk
which
secretes
from
the
very
blood
itself
the
wig
is
the
appropriate
symbol
of
the
man
of
learning
pure
and
simple
it
adorns
the
head
with
a
copious
quantity
of
false
hair
in
lack
of
one
own
just
as
erudition
means
endowing
it
with
a
great
mass
of
alien
thought
this
to
be
sure
does
not
clothe
the
head
so
well
and
naturally
nor
is
it
so
generally
useful
nor
so
suited
for
all
purposes
nor
so
firmly
rooted
nor
when
alien
thought
is
used
up
can
it
be
immediately
replaced
by
more
from
the
same
source
as
is
the
case
with
that
which
springs
from
soil
of
one
own
so
we
find
sterne
in
his
boldly
asserting
that
ounce
of
a
man
own
wit
is
worth
a
ton
of
other
and
in
fact
the
most
profound
erudition
is
no
more
akin
to
genius
than
a
collection
of
dried
plants
in
like
nature
with
its
constant
flow
of
new
life
ever
fresh
ever
young
ever
changing
there
are
no
two
things
more
opposed
than
the
childish
naïveté
of
an
ancient
author
and
the
learning
of
his
commentator
dilettanti
this
is
the
slighting
way
in
which
those
who
pursue
any
branch
of
art
or
learning
for
the
love
and
enjoyment
of
the
thing
il
loro
are
spoken
of
by
those
who
have
taken
it
up
for
the
sake
of
gain
attracted
solely
by
the
prospect
of
money
this
contempt
of
theirs
comes
from
the
base
belief
that
no
man
will
seriously
devote
himself
to
a
subject
unless
he
is
spurred
on
to
it
by
want
hunger
or
else
some
form
of
greed
the
public
is
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
hence
its
general
respect
for
professionals
and
its
distrust
of
but
the
truth
is
that
the
treats
his
subject
as
an
end
whereas
the
professional
pure
and
simple
treats
it
merely
as
a
means
he
alone
will
be
really
in
earnest
about
a
matter
who
has
a
direct
interest
therein
takes
to
it
because
he
likes
it
and
pursues
it
it
is
these
and
not
hirelings
that
have
always
done
the
greatest
work
in
the
republic
of
letters
it
is
as
in
other
republics
favor
is
shown
to
the
plain
man
he
who
goes
his
way
in
silence
and
does
not
set
up
to
be
cleverer
than
others
but
the
abnormal
man
is
looked
upon
as
threatening
danger
people
band
together
against
him
and
have
oh
such
a
majority
on
their
side
the
condition
of
this
republic
is
much
like
that
of
a
small
state
in
america
where
every
man
is
intent
only
upon
his
own
advantage
and
seeks
reputation
and
power
for
himself
quite
heedless
of
the
general
weal
which
then
goes
to
ruin
so
it
is
in
the
republic
of
letters
it
is
himself
and
himself
alone
that
a
man
puts
forward
because
he
wants
to
gain
fame
the
only
thing
in
which
all
agree
is
in
trying
to
keep
down
a
really
eminent
man
if
he
should
chance
to
show
himself
as
one
who
would
be
a
common
peril
from
this
it
is
easy
to
see
how
it
fares
with
knowledge
as
a
whole
between
professors
and
independent
men
of
learning
there
has
always
been
from
of
old
a
certain
antagonism
which
may
perhaps
be
likened
to
that
existing
been
dogs
and
wolves
in
virtue
of
their
position
professors
enjoy
great
facilities
for
becoming
known
to
their
contemporaries
contrarily
independent
men
of
learning
enjoy
by
their
position
great
facilities
for
becoming
known
to
posterity
to
which
it
is
necessary
that
amongst
other
and
much
rarer
gifts
a
man
should
have
a
certain
leisure
and
freedom
as
mankind
takes
a
long
time
in
finding
out
on
whom
to
bestow
its
attention
they
may
both
work
together
side
by
side
he
who
holds
a
professorship
may
be
said
to
receive
his
food
in
the
stall
and
this
is
the
best
way
with
ruminant
animals
but
he
who
finds
his
food
for
himself
at
the
hands
of
nature
is
better
off
in
the
open
field
of
human
knowledge
as
a
whole
and
in
every
branch
of
it
by
far
the
largest
part
exists
nowhere
but
on
paper
i
mean
in
books
that
paper
memory
of
mankind
only
a
small
part
of
it
is
at
any
given
period
really
active
in
the
minds
of
particular
persons
this
is
due
in
the
main
to
the
brevity
and
uncertainty
of
life
but
it
also
comes
from
the
fact
that
men
are
lazy
and
bent
on
pleasure
every
generation
attains
on
its
hasty
passage
through
existence
just
so
much
of
human
knowledge
as
it
needs
and
then
soon
disappears
most
men
of
learning
are
very
superficial
then
follows
a
new
generation
full
of
hope
but
ignorant
and
with
everything
to
learn
from
the
beginning
it
seizes
in
its
turn
just
so
much
as
it
can
grasp
or
find
useful
on
its
brief
journey
and
then
too
goes
its
way
how
badly
it
would
fare
with
human
knowledge
if
it
were
not
for
the
art
of
writing
and
printing
this
it
is
that
makes
libraries
the
only
sure
and
lasting
memory
of
the
human
race
for
its
individual
members
have
all
of
them
but
a
very
limited
and
imperfect
one
hence
most
men
of
learning
as
are
loth
to
have
their
knowledge
examined
as
merchants
to
lay
bare
their
books
human
knowledge
extends
on
all
sides
farther
than
the
eye
can
reach
and
of
that
which
would
be
generally
worth
knowing
no
one
man
can
possess
even
the
thousandth
part
all
branches
of
learning
have
thus
been
so
much
enlarged
that
he
who
would
do
something
has
to
pursue
no
more
than
one
subject
and
disregard
all
others
in
his
own
subject
he
will
then
it
is
true
be
superior
to
the
vulgar
but
in
all
else
he
will
belong
to
it
if
we
add
to
this
that
neglect
of
the
ancient
languages
which
is
on
the
increase
and
is
doing
away
with
all
general
education
in
the
humanities
for
a
mere
smattering
of
latin
and
greek
is
of
no
use
we
shall
come
to
have
men
of
learning
who
outside
their
own
subject
display
an
ignorance
truly
bovine
an
exclusive
specialist
of
this
kind
stands
on
a
par
with
a
workman
in
a
factory
whose
whole
life
is
spent
in
making
one
particular
kind
of
screw
or
catch
or
handle
for
some
particular
instrument
or
machine
in
which
indeed
he
attains
incredible
dexterity
the
specialist
may
also
be
likened
to
a
man
who
lives
in
his
own
house
and
never
leaves
it
there
he
is
perfectly
familiar
with
everything
every
little
step
corner
or
board
much
as
quasimodo
in
victor
hugo
knows
the
cathedral
but
outside
it
all
is
strange
and
unknown
for
true
culture
in
the
humanities
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
a
man
should
be
and
take
large
views
and
for
a
man
of
learning
in
the
higher
sense
of
the
word
an
extensive
acquaintance
with
history
is
needful
he
however
who
wishes
to
be
a
complete
philosopher
must
gather
into
his
head
the
remotest
ends
of
human
knowledge
for
where
else
could
they
ever
come
together
it
is
precisely
minds
of
the
first
order
that
will
never
be
specialists
for
their
very
nature
is
to
make
the
whole
of
existence
their
problem
and
this
is
a
subject
upon
which
they
will
every
one
of
them
in
some
form
provide
mankind
with
a
new
revelation
for
he
alone
can
deserve
the
name
of
genius
who
takes
the
all
the
essential
the
universal
for
the
theme
of
his
achievements
not
he
who
spends
his
life
in
explaining
some
special
relation
of
things
one
to
another
on
thinking
for
oneself
a
library
may
be
very
large
but
if
it
is
in
disorder
it
is
not
so
useful
as
one
that
is
small
but
well
arranged
in
the
same
way
a
man
may
have
a
great
mass
of
knowledge
but
if
he
has
not
worked
it
up
by
thinking
it
over
for
himself
it
has
much
less
value
than
a
far
smaller
amount
which
he
has
thoroughly
pondered
for
it
is
only
when
a
man
looks
at
his
knowledge
from
all
sides
and
combines
the
things
he
knows
by
comparing
truth
with
truth
that
he
obtains
a
complete
hold
over
it
and
gets
it
into
his
power
a
man
can
not
turn
over
anything
in
his
mind
unless
he
knows
it
he
should
therefore
learn
something
but
it
is
only
when
he
has
turned
it
over
that
he
can
be
said
to
know
it
reading
and
learning
are
things
that
anyone
can
do
of
his
own
free
will
but
not
so
thinking
must
be
kindled
like
a
fire
by
a
draught
it
must
be
sustained
by
some
interest
in
the
matter
in
hand
this
interest
may
be
of
purely
objective
kind
or
merely
subjective
the
latter
comes
into
play
only
in
things
that
concern
us
personally
objective
interest
is
confined
to
heads
that
think
by
nature
to
whom
thinking
is
as
natural
as
breathing
and
they
are
very
rare
this
is
why
most
men
of
learning
show
so
little
of
it
it
is
incredible
what
a
different
effect
is
produced
upon
the
mind
by
thinking
for
oneself
as
compared
with
reading
it
carries
on
and
intensifies
that
original
difference
in
the
nature
of
two
minds
which
leads
the
one
to
think
and
the
other
to
read
what
i
mean
is
that
reading
forces
alien
thoughts
upon
the
mind
thoughts
which
are
as
foreign
to
the
drift
and
temper
in
which
it
may
be
for
the
moment
as
the
seal
is
to
the
wax
on
which
it
stamps
its
imprint
the
mind
is
thus
entirely
under
compulsion
from
without
it
is
driven
to
think
this
or
that
though
for
the
moment
it
may
not
have
the
slightest
impulse
or
inclination
to
do
so
but
when
a
man
thinks
for
himself
he
follows
the
impulse
of
his
own
mind
which
is
determined
for
him
at
the
time
either
by
his
environment
or
some
particular
recollection
the
visible
world
of
a
man
surroundings
does
not
as
reading
does
impress
a
definite
thought
upon
his
mind
but
merely
gives
the
matter
and
occasion
which
lead
him
to
think
what
is
appropriate
to
his
nature
and
present
temper
so
it
is
that
much
reading
deprives
the
mind
of
all
elasticity
it
is
like
keeping
a
spring
continually
under
pressure
the
safest
way
of
having
no
thoughts
of
one
own
is
to
take
up
a
book
every
moment
one
has
nothing
else
to
do
it
is
this
practice
which
explains
why
erudition
makes
most
men
more
stupid
and
silly
than
they
are
by
nature
and
prevents
their
writings
obtaining
any
measure
of
success
they
remain
in
pope
words
ever
reading
never
to
be
read

men

some

has

springs
up
in
ourselves
as
the
of
some
prehistoric
plant

a
plant
as

is
nothing
more

astray
a

may
wander

of
them

who
is

genius
he
who
thinks
for
himself
who
thinks
spontaneously
and
exactly
possesses
the
only
compass
by
which
he
can
steer
aright
a
man
should
read
only
when
his
own
thoughts
stagnate
at
their
source
which
will
happen
often
enough
even
with
the
best
of
minds
on
the
other
hand
to
take
up
a
book
for
the
purpose
of
scaring
away
one
own
original
thoughts
is
sin
against
the
holy
spirit
it
is
like
running
away
from
nature
to
look
at
a
museum
of
dried
plants
or
gaze
at
a
landscape
in
copperplate
a
man
may
have
discovered
some
portion
of
truth
or
wisdom
after
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
trouble
in
thinking
it
over
for
himself
and
adding
thought
to
thought
and
it
may
sometimes
happen
that
he
could
have
found
it
all
ready
to
hand
in
a
book
and
spared
himself
the
trouble
but
even
so
it
is
a
hundred
times
more
valuable
if
he
has
acquired
it
by
thinking
it
out
for
himself
for
it
is
only
when
we
gain
our
knowledge
in
this
way
that
it
enters
as
an
integral
part
a
living
member
into
the
whole
system
of
our
thought
that
it
stands
in
complete
and
firm
relation
with
what
we
know
that
it
is
understood
with
all
that
underlies
it
and
follows
from
it
that
it
wears
the
color
the
precise
shade
the
distinguishing
mark
of
our
own
way
of
thinking
that
it
comes
exactly
at
the
right
time
just
as
we

the
necessity
for
it
that

made
by
nature
for
the
work
comes
into
being
as
a
man
does
the
thinking
mind
is
impregnated
from
without
and
it
then
forms
and
bears
its
child
truth
that
has
been
merely
learned
is
like
an
artificial
limb
a
false
tooth
a
waxen
nose
at
best
like
a
nose
made
out
of
another
flesh
it
adheres
to
us
only
because
it
is
put
on
but
truth
acquired
by
thinking
of
our
own
is
like
a
natural
limb
it
alone
really
belongs
to
us
this
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
thinker
and
the
mere
man
of
learning
the
intellectual
attainments
of
a
man
who
thinks
for
himself
resemble
a
fine
painting
where
the
light
and
shade
are
correct
the
tone
sustained
the
color
perfectly
harmonized
it
is
true
to
life
on
the
other
hand
the
intellectual
attainments
of
the
mere
man
of
learning
are
like
a
large
palette
full
of
all
sorts
of
colors
which
at
most
are
systematically
arranged
but
devoid
of
harmony
connection
and
meaning
reading
is
thinking
with
some
one
else
head
instead
of
one
own
to
think
with
one
own
head
is
always
to
aim
at
developing
a
coherent
whole
a
system
even
though
it
be
not
a
strictly
complete
one
and
nothing
hinders
this
so
much
as
too
strong
a
current
of
thoughts
such
as
comes
of
continual
reading
these
thoughts
springing
every
one
of
them
from
different
minds
belonging
to
different
systems
and
tinged
with
different
colors
never
of
themselves
flow
together
into
an
intellectual
whole
they
never
form
a
unity
of
knowledge
or
insight
or
conviction
but
rather
fill
the
head
with
a
babylonian
confusion
of
tongues
the
mind
that
is
with
alien
thought
is
thus
deprived
of
all
clear
insight
and
is
disorganized
this
is
a
state
of
things
observable
in
many
men
of
learning
and
it
makes
them
inferior
in
sound
sense
correct
judgment
and
practical
tact
to
many
illiterate
persons
who
after
obtaining
a
little
knowledge
from
without
by
means
of
experience
intercourse
with
others
and
a
small
amount
of
reading
have
always
subordinated
it
to
and
embodied
it
with
their
own
thought
the
really
scientific
does
the
same
thing
as
these
illiterate
persons
but
on
a
larger
scale
although
he
has
need
of
much
knowledge
and
so
must
read
a
great
deal
his
mind
is
nevertheless
strong
enough
to
master
it
all
to
assimilate
and
incorporate
it
with
the
system
of
his
thoughts
and
so
to
make
it
fit
in
with
the
organic
unity
of
his
insight
which
though
vast
is
always
growing
and
in
the
process
his
own
thought
like
the
bass
in
an
organ
always
dominates
everything
and
is
never
drowned
by
other
tones
as
happens
with
minds
which
are
full
of
mere
antiquarian
lore
where
shreds
of
music
as
it
were
in
every
key
mingle
confusedly
and
no
fundamental
note
is
heard
at
all
those
who
have
spent
their
lives
in
reading
and
taken
their
wisdom
from
books
are
like
people
who
have
obtained
precise
information
about
a
country
from
the
descriptions
of
many
travellers
such
people
can
tell
a
great
deal
about
it
but
after
all
they
have
no
connected
clear
and
profound
knowledge
of
its
real
condition
but
those
who
have
spent
their
lives
in
thinking
resemble
the
travellers
themselves
they
alone
really
know
what
they
are
talking
about
they
are
acquainted
with
the
actual
state
of
affairs
and
are
quite
at
home
in
the
subject
the
thinker
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
the
ordinary
as
an
does
to
the
historian
he
speaks
from
direct
knowledge
of
his
own
that
is
why
all
those
who
think
for
themselves
come
at
bottom
to
much
the
same
conclusion
the
differences
they
present
are
due
to
their
different
points
of
view
and
when
these
do
not
affect
the
matter
they
all
speak
alike
they
merely
express
the
result
of
their
own
objective
perception
of
things
there
are
many
passages
in
my
works
which
i
have
given
to
the
public
only
after
some
hesitation
because
of
their
paradoxical
nature
and
afterwards
i
have
experienced
a
pleasant
surprise
in
finding
the
same
opinion
recorded
in
the
works
of
great
men
who
lived
long
ago
the
merely
reports
what
one
person
has
said
and
another
meant
or
the
objections
raised
by
a
third
and
so
on
he
compares
different
opinions
ponders
criticises
and
tries
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
herein
on
a
par
with
the
critical
historian
for
instance
he
will
set
out
to
inquire
whether
leibnitz
was
not
for
some
time
a
follower
of
spinoza
and
questions
of
a
like
nature
the
curious
student
of
such
matters
may
find
conspicuous
examples
of
what
i
mean
in
herbart
elucidation
of
morality
and
natural
and
in
the
same
author
on
surprise
may
be
felt
that
a
man
of
the
kind
should
put
himself
to
so
much
trouble
for
on
the
face
of
it
if
he
would
only
examine
the
matter
for
himself
he
would
speedily
attain
his
object
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
thought
but
there
is
a
small
difficulty
in
the
way
it
does
not
depend
upon
his
own
will
a
man
can
always
sit
down
and
read
but
not
think
it
is
with
thoughts
as
with
men
they
can
not
always
be
summoned
at
pleasure
we
must
wait
for
them
to
come
thought
about
a
subject
must
appear
of
itself
by
a
happy
and
harmonious
combination
of
external
stimulus
with
mental
temper
and
attention
and
it
is
just
that
which
never
seems
to
come
to
these
people
this
truth
may
be
illustrated
by
what
happens
in
the
case
of
matters
affecting
our
own
personal
interest
when
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
some
resolution
in
a
matter
of
that
kind
we
can
not
well
sit
down
at
any
given
moment
and
think
over
the
merits
of
the
case
and
make
up
our
mind
for
if
we
try
to
do
so
we
often
find
ourselves
unable
at
that
particular
moment
to
keep
our
mind
fixed
upon
the
subject
it
wanders
off
to
other
things
aversion
to
the
matter
in
question
is
sometimes
to
blame
for
this
in
such
a
case
we
should
not
use
force
but
wait
for
the
proper
frame
of
mind
to
come
of
itself
it
often
comes
unexpectedly
and
returns
again
and
again
and
the
variety
of
temper
in
which
we
approach
it
at
different
moments
puts
the
matter
always
in
a
fresh
light
it
is
this
long
process
which
is
understood
by
the
term
ripe
for
the
work
of
coming
to
a
resolution
must
be
distributed
and
in
the
process
much
that
is
overlooked
at
one
moment
occurs
to
us
at
another
and
the
repugnance
vanishes
when
we
find
as
we
usually
do
on
a
closer
inspection
that
things
are
not
so
bad
as
they
seemed
this
rule
applies
to
the
life
of
the
intellect
as
well
as
to
matters
of
practice
a
man
must
wait
for
the
right
moment
not
even
the
greatest
mind
is
capable
of
thinking
for
itself
at
all
times
hence
a
great
mind
does
well
to
spend
its
leisure
in
reading
which
as
i
have
said
is
a
substitute
for
thought
it
brings
stuff
to
the
mind
by
letting
another
person
do
the
thinking
although
that
is
always
done
in
a
manner
not
our
own
therefore
a
man
should
not
read
too
much
in
order
that
his
mind
may
not
become
accustomed
to
the
substitute
and
thereby
forget
the
reality
that
it
may
not
form
the
habit
of
walking
in
paths
nor
by
following
an
alien
course
of
thought
grow
a
stranger
to
its
own
least
of
all
should
a
man
quite
withdraw
his
gaze
from
the
real
world
for
the
mere
sake
of
reading
as
the
impulse
and
the
temper
which
prompt
to
thought
of
one
own
come
far
oftener
from
the
world
of
reality
than
from
the
world
of
books
the
real
life
that
a
man
sees
before
him
is
the
natural
subject
of
thought
and
in
its
strength
as
the
primary
element
of
existence
it
can
more
easily
than
anything
else
rouse
and
influence
the
thinking
mind
after
these
considerations
it
will
not
be
matter
for
surprise
that
a
man
who
thinks
for
himself
can
easily
be
distinguished
from
the
by
the
very
way
in
which
he
talks
by
his
marked
earnestness
and
the
originality
directness
and
personal
conviction
that
stamp
all
his
thoughts
and
expressions
the
on
the
other
hand
lets
it
be
seen
that
everything
he
has
is
that
his
ideas
are
like
the
number
and
trash
of
an
old
collected
together
from
all
quarters
mentally
he
is
dull
and
pointless
a
copy
of
a
copy
his
literary
style
is
made
up
of
conventional
nay
vulgar
phrases
and
terms
that
happen
to
be
current
in
this
respect
much
like
a
small
state
where
all
the
money
that
circulates
is
foreign
because
it
has
no
coinage
of
its
own
mere
experience
can
as
little
as
reading
supply
the
place
of
thought
it
stands
to
thinking
in
the
same
relation
in
which
eating
stands
to
digestion
and
assimilation
when
experience
boasts
that
to
its
discoveries
alone
is
due
the
advancement
of
the
human
race
it
is
as
though
the
mouth
were
to
claim
the
whole
credit
of
maintaining
the
body
in
health
the
works
of
all
truly
capable
minds
are
distinguished
by
a
character
of
and
which
means
they
are
clear
and
free
from
obscurity
a
truly
capable
mind
always
knows
definitely
and
clearly
what
it
is
that
it
wants
to
express
whether
its
medium
is
prose
verse
or
music
other
minds
are
not
decisive
and
not
definite
and
by
this
they
may
be
known
for
what
they
are
the
characteristic
sign
of
a
mind
of
the
highest
order
is
that
it
always
judges
at
first
hand
everything
it
advances
is
the
result
of
thinking
for
itself
and
this
is
everywhere
evident
by
the
way
in
which
it
gives
its
thoughts
utterance
such
a
mind
is
like
a
prince
in
the
realm
of
intellect
its
authority
is
imperial
whereas
the
authority
of
minds
of
a
lower
order
is
delegated
only
as
may
be
seen
in
their
style
which
has
no
independent
stamp
of
its
own
every
one
who
really
thinks
for
himself
is
so
far
like
a
monarch
his
position
is
undelegated
and
supreme
his
judgments
like
royal
decrees
spring
from
his
own
sovereign
power
and
proceed
directly
from
himself
he
acknowledges
authority
as
little
as
a
monarch
admits
a
command
he
subscribes
to
nothing
but
what
he
has
himself
authorized
the
multitude
of
common
minds
laboring
under
all
sorts
of
current
opinions
authorities
prejudices
is
like
the
people
which
silently
obeys
the
law
and
accepts
orders
from
above
those
who
are
so
zealous
and
eager
to
settle
debated
questions
by
citing
authorities
are
really
glad
when
they
are
able
to
put
the
understanding
and
the
insight
of
others
into
the
field
in
place
of
their
own
which
are
wanting
their
number
is
legion
for
as
seneca
says
there
is
no
man
but
prefers
belief
to
the
exercise
of
judgment
mavult
credere
quam
in
their
controversies
such
people
make
a
promiscuous
use
of
the
weapon
of
authority
and
strike
out
at
one
another
with
it
if
any
one
chances
to
become
involved
in
such
a
contest
he
will
do
well
not
to
try
reason
and
argument
as
a
mode
of
defence
for
against
a
weapon
of
that
kind
these
people
are
like
siegfrieds
with
a
skin
of
horn
and
dipped
in
the
flood
of
incapacity
for
thinking
and
judging
they
will
meet
his
attack
by
bringing
up
their
authorities
as
a
way
of
abashing
him
ad
and
then
cry
out
that
they
have
won
the
battle
in
the
real
world
be
it
never
so
fair
favorable
and
pleasant
we
always
live
subject
to
the
law
of
gravity
which
we
have
to
be
constantly
overcoming
but
in
the
world
of
intellect
we
are
disembodied
spirits
held
in
bondage
to
no
such
law
and
free
from
penury
and
distress
thus
it
is
that
there
exists
no
happiness
on
earth
like
that
which
at
the
auspicious
moment
a
fine
and
fruitful
mind
finds
in
itself
the
presence
of
a
thought
is
like
the
presence
of
a
woman
we
love
we
fancy
we
shall
never
forget
the
thought
nor
become
indifferent
to
the
dear
one
but
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
the
finest
thought
runs
the
risk
of
being
irrevocably
forgotten
if
we
do
not
write
it
down
and
the
darling
of
being
deserted
if
we
do
not
marry
her
there
are
plenty
of
thoughts
which
are
valuable
to
the
man
who
thinks
them
but
only
few
of
them
which
have
enough
strength
to
produce
repercussive
or
reflect
action
i
mean
to
win
the
reader
sympathy
after
they
have
been
put
on
paper
but
still
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
a
true
value
attaches
only
to
what
a
man
has
thought
in
the
first
instance
his
own
thinkers
may
be
classed
according
as
they
think
chiefly
for
their
own
case
or
for
that
of
others
the
former
are
the
genuine
independent
thinkers
they
really
think
and
are
really
independent
they
are
the
true
they
alone
are
in
earnest
the
pleasure
and
the
happiness
of
their
existence
consists
in
thinking
the
others
are
the
they
want
to
seem
that
which
they
are
not
and
seek
their
happiness
in
what
they
hope
to
get
from
the
world
they
are
in
earnest
about
nothing
else
to
which
of
these
two
classes
a
man
belongs
may
be
seen
by
his
whole
style
and
manner
lichtenberg
is
an
example
for
the
former
class
herder
there
can
be
no
doubt
belongs
to
the
second
when
one
considers
how
vast
and
how
close
to
us
is
problem
of
this
equivocal
tortured
fleeting
existence
of
ours
so
vast
and
so
close
that
a
man
no
sooner
discovers
it
than
it
overshadows
and
obscures
all
other
problems
and
aims
and
when
one
sees
how
all
men
with
few
and
rare
exceptions
have
no
clear
consciousness
of
the
problem
nay
seem
to
be
quite
unaware
of
its
presence
but
busy
themselves
with
everything
rather
than
with
this
and
live
on
taking
no
thought
but
for
the
passing
day
and
the
hardly
longer
span
of
their
own
personal
future
either
expressly
discarding
the
problem
or
else
to
come
to
terms
with
it
by
adopting
some
system
of
popular
metaphysics
and
letting
it
satisfy
them
when
i
say
one
takes
all
this
to
heart
one
may
come
to
the
opinion
that
man
may
be
said
to
be
thinking
only
in
a
very
remote
sense
and
henceforth
feel
no
special
surprise
at
any
trait
of
human
thoughtlessness
or
folly
but
know
rather
that
the
normal
intellectual
range
of
vision
does
indeed
extend
beyond
that
of
the
brute
whose
whole
existence
is
as
it
were
a
continual
present
with
no
consciousness
of
the
past
or
the
future
but
not
such
an
immeasurable
distance
as
is
generally
supposed
this
is
in
fact
corroborated
by
the
way
in
which
most
men
converse
where
their
thoughts
are
found
to
be
chopped
up
fine
like
chaff
so
that
for
them
to
spin
out
a
discourse
of
any
length
is
impossible
if
this
world
were
peopled
by
really
thinking
beings
it
could
not
be
that
noise
of
every
kind
would
be
allowed
such
generous
limits
as
is
the
case
with
the
most
horrible
and
at
the
same
time
aimless
form
of
it
if
nature
had
meant
man
to
think
she
would
not
have
given
him
ears
or
at
any
rate
she
would
have
furnished
them
with
airtight
flaps
such
as
are
the
enviable
possession
of
the
bat
but
in
truth
man
is
a
poor
animal
like
the
rest
and
his
powers
are
meant
only
to
maintain
him
in
the
struggle
for
existence
so
he
must
need
keep
his
ears
always
open
to
announce
of
themselves
by
night
as
by
day
the
approach
of
the
pursuer

to
the
cracking
of
whips

the

the

which
is
the
most
perfect
reflection
of
human
existence

are
three
stages
in
the
presentation
of
the
subject
with
a
corresponding
variety
in
the
design
and
scope
of
the
piece
at

is
also
the
most
common
stage
the
drama
is
never
anything
more
than
merely
the
persons
gain
our
attention
by
following
their
own
aims
which
resemble
ours
the
action
advances
by
means
of
intrigue
and
the
play
of
character
and
incident
while
wit
and
raillery
season
the
whole
at
the
second
stage
the
drama
becomes
sympathy
is
roused
with
the
hero
and
indirectly
with
ourselves
the
action
takes
a
pathetic
turn
but
the
end
is
peaceful
and
satisfactory
the
climax
is
reached
with
the
third
stage
which
is
the
most
difficult
there
the
drama
aims
at
being
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
great
suffering
and
the
storm
and
stress
of
existence
and
the
outcome
of
it
is
to
show
the
vanity
of
all
human
effort
deeply
moved
we
are
either
directly
prompted
to
disengage
our
will
from
the
struggle
of
life
or
else
a
chord
is
struck
in
us
which
echoes
a
similar
feeling
the
beginning
it
is
said
is
always
difficult
in
the
drama
it
is
just
the
contrary
for
these
the
difficulty
always
lies
in
the
end
this
is
proved
by
countless
plays
which
promise
very
well
for
the
first
act
or
two
and
then
become
muddled
stick
or
falter
notoriously
so
in
the
fourth
act
and
finally
conclude
in
a
way
that
is
either
forced
or
unsatisfactory
or
else
long
foreseen
by
every
one
sometimes
too
the
end
is
positively
revolting
as
in
lessing
which
sends
the
spectators
home
in
a
temper
this
difficulty
in
regard
to
the
end
of
a
play
arises
partly
because
it
is
everywhere
easier
to
get
things
into
a
tangle
than
to
get
them
out
again
partly
also
because
at
the
beginning
we
give
the
author
to
do
as
he
likes
but
at
the
end
make
certain
definite
demands
upon
him
thus
we
ask
for
a
conclusion
that
shall
be
either
quite
happy
or
else
quite
tragic
whereas
human
affairs
do
not
easily
take
so
decided
a
turn
and
then
we
expect
that
it
shall
be
natural
fit
and
proper
unlabored
and
at
the
same
time
foreseen
by
no
one
these
remarks
are
also
applicable
to
an
epic
and
to
a
novel
but
the
more
compact
nature
of
the
drama
makes
the
difficulty
plainer
by
increasing
it
nihilo
nihil
that
nothing
can
come
from
nothing
is
a
maxim
true
in
fine
art
as
elsewhere
in
composing
an
historical
picture
a
good
artist
will
use
living
men
as
a
model
and
take
the
groundwork
of
the
faces
from
life
and
then
proceed
to
idealize
them
in
point
of
beauty
or
expression
a
similar
method
i
fancy
is
adopted
by
good
novelists
in
drawing
a
character
they
take
a
general
outline
of
it
from
some
real
person
of
their
acquaintance
and
then
idealize
and
complete
it
to
suit
their
purpose
a
novel
will
be
of
a
high
and
noble
order
the
more
it
represents
of
inner
and
the
less
it
represents
of
outer
life
and
the
ratio
between
the
two
will
supply
a
means
of
judging
any
novel
of
whatever
kind
from
down
to
the
crudest
and
most
sensational
tale
of
knight
or
robber
has
indeed
as
good
as
no
action
at
all
and
there
is
not
much
in
nouvelle
and
even
has
relatively
little
and
what
there
is
very
unimportant
and
introduced
merely
for
the
sake
of
fun
and
these
four
are
the
best
of
all
existing
novels
consider
further
the
wonderful
romances
of
jean
paul
and
how
much
inner
life
is
shown
on
the
narrowest
basis
of
actual
event
even
in
walter
scott
novels
there
is
a
great
preponderance
of
inner
over
outer
life
and
incident
is
never
brought
in
except
for
the
purpose
of
giving
play
to
thought
and
emotion
whereas
in
bad
novels
incident
is
there
on
its
own
account
skill
consists
in
setting
the
inner
life
in
motion
with
the
smallest
possible
array
of
circumstance
for
it
is
this
inner
life
that
really
excites
our
interest
the
business
of
the
novelist
is
not
to
relate
great
events
but
to
make
small
ones
interesting
history
which
i
like
to
think
of
as
the
contrary
of
poetry
greek
istoroumenon
pepoiaemenon
is
for
time
what
geography
is
for
space
and
it
is
no
more
to
be
called
a
science
in
any
strict
sense
of
the
word
than
is
geography
because
it
does
not
deal
with
universal
truths
but
only
with
particular
details
history
has
always
been
the
favorite
study
of
those
who
wish
to
learn
something
without
having
to
face
the
effort
demanded
by
any
branch
of
real
knowledge
which
taxes
the
intelligence
in
our
time
history
is
a
favorite
pursuit
as
witness
the
numerous
books
upon
the
subject
which
appear
every
year
if
the
reader
can
not
help
thinking
with
me
that
history
is
merely
the
constant
recurrence
of
similar
things
just
as
in
a
kaleidoscope
the
same
bits
of
glass
are
represented
but
in
different
combinations
he
will
not
be
able
to
share
all
this
lively
interest
nor
however
will
he
censure
it
but
there
is
a
ridiculous
and
absurd
claim
made
by
many
people
to
regard
history
as
a
part
of
philosophy
nay
as
philosophy
itself
they
imagine
that
history
can
take
its
place
the
preference
shown
for
history
by
the
greater
public
in
all
ages
may
be
illustrated
by
the
kind
of
conversation
which
is
so
much
in
vogue
everywhere
in
society
it
generally
consists
in
one
person
relating
something
and
then
another
person
relating
something
else
so
that
in
this
way
everyone
is
sure
of
receiving
attention
both
here
and
in
the
case
of
history
it
is
plain
that
the
mind
is
occupied
with
particular
details
but
as
in
science
so
also
in
every
worthy
conversation
the
mind
rises
to
the
consideration
of
some
general
truth
this
objection
does
not
however
deprive
history
of
its
value
human
life
is
short
and
fleeting
and
many
millions
of
individuals
share
in
it
who
are
swallowed
by
that
monster
of
oblivion
which
is
waiting
for
them
with
jaws
it
is
thus
a
very
thankworthy
task
to
try
to
rescue
something
the
memory
of
interesting
and
important
events
or
the
leading
features
and
personages
of
some
epoch
from
the
general
shipwreck
of
the
world
from
another
point
of
view
we
might
look
upon
history
as
the
sequel
to
zoology
for
while
with
all
other
animals
it
is
enough
to
observe
the
species
with
man
individuals
and
therefore
individual
events
have
to
be
studied
because
every
man
possesses
a
character
as
an
individual
and
since
individuals
and
events
are
without
number
or
end
an
essential
imperfection
attaches
to
history
in
the
study
of
it
all
that
a
man
learns
never
contributes
to
lessen
that
which
he
has
still
to
learn
with
any
real
science
a
perfection
of
knowledge
is
at
any
rate
conceivable
when
we
gain
access
to
the
histories
of
china
and
of
india
the
endlessness
of
the
will
reveal
to
us
the
defects
in
the
study
and
force
our
historians
to
see
that
the
object
of
science
is
to
recognize
the
many
in
the
one
to
perceive
the
rules
in
any
given
example
and
to
apply
to
the
life
of
nations
a
knowledge
of
mankind
not
to
go
on
counting
up
facts
there
are
two
kinds
of
history
the
history
of
politics
and
the
history
of
literature
and
art
the
one
is
the
history
of
the
will
the
other
that
of
the
intellect
the
first
is
a
tale
of
woe
even
of
terror
it
is
a
record
of
agony
struggle
fraud
and
horrible
murder
the
second
is
everywhere
pleasing
and
serene
like
the
intellect
when
left
to
itself
even
though
its
path
be
one
of
error
its
chief
branch
is
the
history
of
philosophy
this
is
in
fact
its
fundamental
bass
and
the
notes
of
it
are
heard
even
in
the
other
kind
of
history
these
deep
tones
guide
the
formation
of
opinion
and
opinion
rules
the
world
hence
philosophy
rightly
understood
is
a
material
force
of
the
most
powerful
kind
though
very
slow
in
its
working
the
philosophy
of
a
period
is
thus
the
fundamental
bass
of
its
history
the
newspaper
is
the
in
the
clock
of
history
and
it
is
not
only
made
of
baser
metal
than
those
which
point
to
the
minute
and
the
hour
but
it
seldom
goes
right
the
leading
article
is
the
chorus
to
the
drama
of
passing
events
exaggeration
of
every
kind
is
as
essential
to
journalism
as
it
is
to
the
dramatic
art
for
the
object
of
journalism
is
to
make
events
go
as
far
as
possible
thus
it
is
that
all
journalists
are
in
the
very
nature
of
their
calling
alarmists
and
this
is
their
way
of
giving
interest
to
what
they
write
herein
they
are
like
little
dogs
if
anything
stirs
they
immediately
set
up
a
shrill
bark
therefore
let
us
carefully
regulate
the
attention
to
be
paid
to
this
trumpet
of
danger
so
that
it
may
not
disturb
our
digestion
let
us
recognize
that
a
newspaper
is
at
best
but
a
and
very
often
merely
a
shadow
on
the
wall
the
is
to
thought
what
the
stick
is
to
walking
but
you
walk
most
easily
when
you
have
no
stick
and
you
think
with
the
greatest
perfection
when
you
have
no
pen
in
your
hand
it
is
only
when
a
man
begins
to
be
old
that
he
likes
to
use
a
stick
and
is
glad
to
take
up
his
pen
when
an
has
once
come
to
birth
in
the
mind
or
gained
a
footing
there
it
leads
a
life
so
far
comparable
with
the
life
of
an
organism
as
that
it
assimilates
matter
from
the
outer
world
only
when
it
is
like
in
kind
with
it
and
beneficial
and
when
contrarily
such
matter
is
not
like
in
kind
but
hurtful
the
hypothesis
equally
with
the
organism
throws
it
off
or
if
forced
to
take
it
gets
rid
of
it
again
entire
to
gain
an
author
must
possess
so
many
excellences
that
while
it
will
not
be
easy
to
find
anyone
to
understand
and
appreciate
them
all
there
will
be
men
in
every
age
who
are
able
to
recognize
and
value
some
of
them
in
this
way
the
credit
of
his
book
will
be
maintained
throughout
the
long
course
of
centuries
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
human
interests
are
always
changing
an
author
like
this
who
has
a
claim
to
the
continuance
of
his
life
even
with
posterity
can
only
be
a
man
who
over
the
wide
earth
will
seek
his
like
in
vain
and
offer
a
palpable
contrast
with
everyone
else
in
virtue
of
his
unmistakable
distinction
nay
more
were
he
like
the
wandering
jew
to
live
through
several
generations
he
would
still
remain
in
the
same
superior
position
if
this
were
not
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
why
his
thoughts
should
not
perish
like
those
of
other
men
and
are
of
great
value
in
so
far
as
they
explain
an
unknown
relation
by
a
known
one
even
the
more
detailed
simile
which
grows
into
a
parable
or
an
allegory
is
nothing
more
than
the
exhibition
of
some
relation
in
its
simplest
most
visible
and
palpable
form
the
growth
of
ideas
rests
at
bottom
upon
similes
because
ideas
arise
by
a
process
of
combining
the
similarities
and
neglecting
the
differences
between
things
further
intelligence
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
ultimately
consists
in
a
seizing
of
relations
and
a
clear
and
pure
grasp
of
relations
is
all
the
more
often
attained
when
the
comparison
is
made
between
cases
that
lie
wide
apart
from
one
another
and
between
things
of
quite
different
nature
as
long
as
a
relation
is
known
to
me
as
existing
only
in
a
single
case
i
have
but
an
idea
of
it
in
other
words
only
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
it
but
as
soon
as
i
see
the
same
relation
in
two
different
cases
i
have
a
idea
of
its
whole
nature
and
this
is
a
deeper
and
more
perfect
knowledge
since
then
similes
and
metaphors
are
such
a
powerful
engine
of
knowledge
it
is
a
sign
of
great
intelligence
in
a
writer
if
his
similes
are
unusual
and
at
the
same
time
to
the
point
aristotle
also
observes
that
by
far
the
most
important
thing
to
a
writer
is
to
have
this
power
of
metaphor
for
it
is
a
gift
which
can
not
be
acquired
and
it
is
a
mark
of
genius
as
regards
to
require
that
a
man
shall
retain
everything
he
has
ever
read
is
like
asking
him
to
carry
about
with
him
all
he
has
ever
eaten
the
one
kind
of
food
has
given
him
bodily
and
the
other
mental
nourishment
and
it
is
through
these
two
means
that
he
has
grown
to
be
what
he
is
the
body
assimilates
only
that
which
is
like
it
and
so
a
man
retains
in
his
mind
only
that
which
interests
him
in
other
words
that
which
suits
his
system
of
thought
or
his
purposes
in
life
if
a
man
wants
to
read
good
books
he
must
make
a
point
of
avoiding
bad
ones
for
life
is
short
and
time
and
energy
limited
est
mater
any
book
that
is
at
all
important
ought
to
be
at
once
read
through
twice
partly
because
on
a
second
reading
the
connection
of
the
different
portions
of
the
book
will
be
better
understood
and
the
beginning
comprehended
only
when
the
end
is
known
and
partly
because
we
are
not
in
the
same
temper
and
disposition
on
both
readings
on
the
second
perusal
we
get
a
new
view
of
every
passage
and
a
different
impression
of
the
whole
book
which
then
appears
in
another
light
a
man
works
are
the
quintessence
of
his
mind
and
even
though
he
may
possess
very
great
capacity
they
will
always
be
incomparably
more
valuable
than
his
conversation
nay
in
all
essential
matters
his
works
will
not
only
make
up
for
the
lack
of
personal
intercourse
with
him
but
they
will
far
surpass
it
in
solid
advantages
the
writings
even
of
a
man
of
moderate
genius
may
be
edifying
worth
reading
and
instructive
because
they
are
his
quintessence
the
result
and
fruit
of
all
his
thought
and
study
whilst
conversation
with
him
may
be
unsatisfactory
so
it
is
that
we
can
read
books
by
men
in
whose
company
we
find
nothing
to
please
and
that
a
high
degree
of
culture
leads
us
to
seek
entertainment
almost
wholly
from
books
and
not
from
men
on
criticism
the
following
brief
remarks
on
the
critical
faculty
are
chiefly
intended
to
show
that
for
the
most
part
there
is
no
such
thing
it
is
a
almost
as
rare
indeed
as
the
phoenix
which
appears
only
once
in
five
hundred
years
when
we
speak
of
an
expression
not
chosen
with
any
regard
for
it
we
mean
the
discovery
or
it
may
be
only
the
recognition
of
what
is
apart
from
the
guidance
of
any
rule
and
this
either
because
no
rule
has
as
yet
been
extended
to
the
matter
in
question
or
else
because
if
existing
it
is
unknown
to
the
artist
or
the
critic
as
the
case
may
be
instead
of
we
might
use
the
expression
if
this
were
not
tautological
the
perceptive
critical
taste
is
so
to
speak
the
female
analogue
to
the
male
quality
of
productive
talent
or
genius
not
capable
of
great
work
itself
it
consists
in
a
capacity
of
that
is
to
say
of
recognizing
as
such
what
is
right
fit
beautiful
or
the
reverse
in
other
words
of
discriminating
the
good
from
the
bad
of
discovering
and
appreciating
the
one
and
condemning
the
other
in
appreciating
a
genius
criticism
should
not
deal
with
the
errors
in
his
productions
or
with
the
poorer
of
his
works
and
then
proceed
to
rate
him
low
it
should
attend
only
to
the
qualities
in
which
he
most
excels
for
in
the
sphere
of
intellect
as
in
other
spheres
weakness
and
perversity
cleave
so
firmly
to
human
nature
that
even
the
most
brilliant
mind
is
not
wholly
and
at
all
times
free
from
them
hence
the
great
errors
to
be
found
even
in
the
works
of
the
greatest
men
or
as
horace
puts
it
bonus
dormitat
that
which
distinguishes
genius
and
should
be
the
standard
for
judging
it
is
the
height
to
which
it
is
able
to
soar
when
it
is
in
the
proper
mood
and
finds
a
fitting
occasion
a
height
always
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
talent
and
in
like
manner
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
compare
two
great
men
of
the
same
class
for
instance
two
great
poets
or
musicians
or
philosophers
or
artists
because
injustice
to
the
one
or
the
other
at
least
for
the
moment
can
hardly
be
avoided
for
in
making
a
comparison
of
the
kind
the
critic
looks
to
some
particular
merit
of
the
one
and
at
once
discovers
that
it
is
absent
in
the
other
who
is
thereby
disparaged
and
then
if
the
process
is
reversed
and
the
critic
begins
with
the
latter
and
discovers
his
peculiar
merit
which
is
quite
of
a
different
order
from
that
presented
by
the
former
with
whom
it
may
be
looked
for
in
vain
the
result
is
that
both
of
them
suffer
undue
depreciation
there
are
critics
who
severally
think
that
it
rests
with
each
one
of
them
what
shall
be
accounted
good
and
what
bad
they
all
mistake
their
own
for
the
trombones
of
fame
a
drug
does
not
effect
its
purpose
if
the
dose
is
too
large
and
it
is
the
same
with
censure
and
adverse
criticism
when
it
exceeds
the
measure
of
justice
the
disastrous
thing
for
intellectual
merit
is
that
it
must
wait
for
those
to
praise
the
good
who
have
themselves
produced
nothing
but
what
is
bad
nay
it
is
a
primary
misfortune
that
it
has
to
receive
its
crown
at
the
hands
of
the
critical
power
of
mankind
a
quality
of
which
most
men
possess
only
the
weak
and
impotent
semblance
so
that
the
reality
may
be
numbered
amongst
the
rarest
gifts
of
nature
hence

unhappily

these
that
are
lacking
men
do
not
know
how
to
distinguish
the

or
to
perceive
the
wide
gulf
that
separates

genius
from

we
have
that
bad

of
things
described
in

when
any
genuine
and
excellent
work
makes
its

the
chief
difficulty
in
its
way
is
the
amount
of
bad
work
it
finds
already
in

of
the
field
and
accepted
as
though
it
were
good
and
then
if
after
a
long
time
the
new
comer
really
succeeds
by
a
hard
struggle
in
vindicating
his
place
for
himself
and
winning
reputation
he
will
soon
encounter
fresh
difficulty
from
some
affected
dull
awkward
imitator
whom
people
drag
in
with
the
object
of
calmly
setting
him
up
on
the
altar
beside
the
genius
not
seeing
the
difference
and
really
thinking
that
here
they
have
to
do
with
another
great
man
this
is
what
yriarte

by
the

the

this
lack
of
critical
insight
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
while
in
every
century
the
excellent
work
of
earlier
time
is
held
in
honor
that
of
its
own
is
misunderstood
and
the
attention
which
is
its
due
is
given
to
bad
work
such
as
every
decade
carries
with
it
only
to
be
the
sport
of
the
next
that
men
are
slow
to
recognize
genuine
merit
when
it
appears
in
their
own
age
also
proves
that
they
do
not
understand
or
enjoy
or
really
value
the
works
of
genius
which
they
honor
only
on
the
score
of
authority
the
crucial
test
is
the
fact
that
bad
work
fichte
philosophy
for
example
if
it
wins
any
reputation
also
maintains
it
for
one
or
two
generations
and
only
when
its
public
is
very
large
does
its
fall
follow
sooner
now
just
as
the
sun
can
not
shed

light
but
to
the
eye
that
sees
it
nor
music
sound
but
to
the
hearing
ear
so
the
value
of
all
masterly
work
in
art
and
science
is
conditioned
by
the
kinship
and
capacity
of
the
mind
to
which
it
speaks
it
is
only
such
a
mind
as
this
that
possesses
the
magic
word
to
stir
and
call
forth
the
spirits
that
lie
hidden
in
great
work
to
the
ordinary
mind
a
masterpiece
is
a
sealed
cabinet
of
mystery
an
unfamiliar
musical
instrument
from
which
the
player
however
much
he
may
flatter
himself
can
draw
none
but
confused
tones
how
different
a
painting
looks
when
seen
in
a
good
light
as
compared
with
some
dark
corner
just
in
the
same
way
the
impression
made
by
a
masterpiece
varies
with
the
capacity
of
the
mind
to
understand
it
a
fine
work
then
requires
a
mind
sensitive
to
its
beauty
a
thoughtful
work
a
mind
that
can
really
think
if
it
is
to
exist
and
live
at
all
but
alas
it
may
happen
only
too
often
that
he
who
gives
a
fine
work
to
the
world
afterwards
feels
like
a
maker
of
fireworks
who
displays
with
enthusiasm
the
wonders
that
have
taken
him
so
much
time
and
trouble
to
prepare
and
then
learns
that
he
has
come
to
the
wrong
place
and
that
the
fancied
spectators
were
one
and
all
inmates
of
an
asylum
for
the
blind
still
even
that
is
better
than
if
his
public
had
consisted
entirely
of
men
who
made
fireworks
themselves
as
in
this
case
if
his
display
had
been
extraordinarily
good
it
might
possibly
have
cost
him
his
head
the
source
of
all
pleasure
and
delight
is
the
feeling
of
kinship
even
with
the
sense
of
beauty
it
is
unquestionably
our
own
species
in
the
animal
world
and
then
again
our
own
race
that
appears
to
us
the
fairest
so
too
in
intercourse
with
others
every
man
shows
a
decided
preference
for
those
who
resemble
him
and
a
blockhead
will
find
the
society
of
another
blockhead
incomparably
more
pleasant
than
that
of
any
number
of
great
minds
put
together
every
man
must
necessarily
take
his
chief
pleasure
in
his
own
work
because
it
is
the
mirror
of
his
own
mind
the
echo
of
his
own
thought
and
next
in
order
will
come
the
work
of
people
like
him
that
is
to
say
a
dull
shallow
and
perverse
man
a
dealer
in
mere
words
will
give
his
sincere
and
hearty
applause
only
to
that
which
is
dull
shallow
perverse
or
merely
verbose
on
the
other
hand
he
will
allow
merit
to
the
work
of
great
minds
only
on
the
score
of
authority
in
other
words
because
he
is
ashamed
to
speak
his
opinion
for
in
reality
they
give
him
no
pleasure
at
all
they
do
not
appeal
to
him
nay
they
repel
him
and
he
will
not
confess
this
even
to
himself
the
works
of
genius
can
not
be
fully
enjoyed
except
by
those
who
are
themselves
of
the
privileged
order
the
first
recognition
of
them
however
when
they
exist
without
authority
to
support
them
demands
considerable
superiority
of
mind
when
the
reader
takes
all
this
into
consideration
he
should
be
surprised
not
that
great
work
is
so
late
in
winning
reputation
but
that
it
wins
it
at
all
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
fame
comes
only
by
a
slow
and
complex
process
the
stupid
person
is
by
degrees
forced
and
as
it
were
tamed
into
recognizing
the
superiority
of
one
who
stands
immediately
above
him
this
one
in
his
turn
bows
before
some
one
else
and
so
it
goes
on
until
the
weight
of
the
votes
gradually
prevail
over
their
number
and
this
is
just
the
condition
of
all
genuine
in
other
words
deserved
fame
but
until
then
the
greatest
genius
even
after
he
has
passed
his
time
of
trial
stands
like
a
king
amidst
a
crowd
of
his
own
subjects
who
do
not
know
him
by
sight
and
therefore
will
not
do
his
behests
unless
indeed
his
chief
ministers
of
state
are
in
his
train
for
no
subordinate
official
can
be
the
direct
recipient
of
the
royal
commands
as
he
knows
only
the
signature
of
his
immediate
superior
and
this
is
repeated
all
the
way
up
into
the
highest
ranks
where
the
attests
the
minister
signature
and
the
minister
that
of
the
king
there
are
analogous
stages
to
be
passed
before
a
genius
can
attain
widespread
fame
this
is
why
his
reputation
most
easily
comes
to
a
standstill
at
the
very
outset
because
the
highest
authorities
of
whom
there
can
be
but
few
are
most
frequently
not
to
be
found
but
the
further
down
he
goes
in
the
scale
the
more
numerous
are
those
who
take
the
word
from
above
so
that
his
fame
is
no
more
arrested
we
must
console
ourselves
for
this
state
of
things
by
reflecting
that
it
is
really
fortunate
that
the
greater
number
of
men
do
not
form
a
judgment
on
their
own
responsibility
but
merely
take
it
on
authority
for
what
sort
of
criticism
should
we
have
on
plato
and
kant
homer
shakespeare
and
goethe
if
every
man
were
to
form
his
opinion
by
what
he
really
has
and
enjoys
of
these
writers
instead
of
being
forced
by
authority
to
speak
of
them
in
a
fit
and
proper
way
however
little
he
may
really
feel
what
he
says
unless
something
of
this
kind
took
place
it
would
be
impossible
for
true
merit
in
any
high
sphere
to
attain
fame
at
all
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
fortunate
that
every
man
has
just
so
much
critical
power
of
his
own
as
is
necessary
for
recognizing
the
superiority
of
those
who
are
placed
immediately
over
him
and
for
following
their
lead
this
means
that
the
many
come
in
the
end
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
few
and
there
results
that
hierarchy
of
critical
judgments
on
which
is
based
the
possibility
of
a
steady
and
eventually
fame
the
lowest
class
in
the
community
is
quite
impervious
to
the
merits
of
a
great
genius
and
for
these
people
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
monument
raised
to
him
which
by
the
impression
it
produces
on
their
senses
awakes
in
them
a
dim
idea
of
the
man

literary
journals
should
be

the
unconscionable

the
deluge
of
bad
and
useless
books
their
judgments
should
be
uncorrupted
just
and
rigorous
and
every
piece
of
bad
work
done
by
an
incapable
person
every
device
by
which
the
empty
head
tries
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
empty
purse
that
is
to
say
about
of
all
existing
books
should
be
mercilessly
scourged
literary
journals
would
then
perform
their
duty
which
is
to
keep
down
the
craving
for
writing
and
put
a
check
upon
the
deception
of
the
public
instead
of
furthering
these
evils
by
a
miserable
toleration
which
plays
into
the
hands
of
author
and
publisher
and
robs
the
reader
of
his
time
and
his
money
if
there
were
such
a
paper
as
i
mean
every
bad
writer
every
brainless
compiler
every
plagiarist
from
other
books
every
hollow
and
incapable
every
every
vain
and
languishing
poetaster
would
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
the
pillory
in
which
his
bad
work
would
inevitably
have
to
stand
soon
after
publication
this
would
paralyze
his
twitching
fingers
to
the
true
welfare
of
literature
in
which
what
is
bad
is
not
only
useless
but
positively
pernicious
now
most
books
are
bad
and
ought
to
have
remained
unwritten
consequently
praise
should
be
as
rare
as
is
now
the
case
with
blame
which
is
withheld
under
the
influence
of
personal
considerations
coupled
with
the
maxim
socius
laudes
lauderis
ut
it
is
quite
wrong
to
try
to
introduce
into
literature
the
same
toleration
as
must
necessarily
prevail
in
society
towards
those
stupid
brainless
people
who
everywhere
swarm
in
it
in
literature
such
people
are
impudent
intruders
and
to
disparage
the
bad
is
here
duty
towards
the
good
for
he
who
thinks
nothing
bad
will
think
nothing
good
either
politeness
which
has
its
source
in
social
relations
is
in
literature
an
alien
and
often
injurious
element
because
it
exacts
that
bad
work
shall
be
called
good
in
this
way
the
very
aim
of
science
and
art
is
directly
frustrated
the
ideal
journal
could
to
be
sure
be
written
only
by
people
who
joined
incorruptible
honesty
with
rare
knowledge
and
still
rarer
power
of
judgment
so
that
perhaps
there
could
at
the
very
most
be
one
and
even
hardly
one
in
the
whole
country
but
there
it
would
stand
like
a
just
aeropagus
every
member
of
which
would
have
to
be
elected
by
all
the
others
under
the
system
that
prevails
at
present
literary
journals
are
carried
on
by
a
clique
and
secretly
perhaps
also
by
booksellers
for
the
good
of
the
trade
and
they
are
often
nothing
but
coalitions
of
bad
heads
to
prevent
the
good
ones
succeeding
as
goethe
once
remarked
to
me
nowhere
is
there
so
much
dishonesty
as
in
literature
but
above
all
anonymity
that
shield
of
all
literary
rascality
would
have
to
disappear
it
was
introduced
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
the
honest
critic
who
warned
the
public
against
the
resentment
of
the
author
and
his
friends
but
where
there
is
one
case
of
this
sort
there
will
be
a
hundred
where
it
merely
serves
to
take
all
responsibility
from
the
man
who
can
not
stand
by
what
he
has
said
or
possibly
to
conceal
the
shame
of
one
who
has
been
cowardly
and
base
enough
to
recommend
a
book
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
of
putting
money
into
his
own
pocket
often
enough
it
is
only
a
cloak
for
covering
the
obscurity
incompetence
and
insignificance
of
the
critic
it
is
incredible
what
impudence
these
fellows
will
show
and
what
literary
trickery
they
will
venture
to
commit
as
soon
as
they
know
they
are
safe
under
the
shadow
of
anonymity
let
me
recommend
a
general
a
universal
medicine
or
panacea
to
put
a
stop
to
all
anonymous
reviewing
whether
it
praises
the
bad
or
blames
the
good
your
for
a
man
to
wrap
himself
up
and
draw
his
hat
over
his
face
and
then
fall
upon
people
who
are
walking
about
without
any
disguise
this
is
not
the
part
of
a
gentleman
it
is
the
part
of
a
scoundrel
and
a
knave
an
anonymous
review
has
no
more
authority
than
an
anonymous
letter
and
one
should
be
received
with
the
same
mistrust
as
the
other
or
shall
we
take
the
name
of
the
man
who
consents
to
preside
over
what
is
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
société
as
a
guarantee
for
the
veracity
of
his
colleagues
even
rousseau
in
the
preface
to
the
declares
honnête
homme
doit
avouer
les
livres
which
in
plain
language
means
that
every
honorable
man
ought
to
sign
his
articles
and
that
no
one
is
honorable
who
does
not
do
so
how
much
truer
this
is
of
polemical
writing
which
is
the
general
character
of
reviews
riemer
was
quite
right
in
the
opinion
he
gives
in
his
of
goethe
an
overt
he
says
enemy
who
meets
you
face
to
face
is
an
honorable
man
who
will
treat
you
fairly
and
with
whom
you
can
come
to
terms
and
be
reconciled
but
an
enemy
who
conceals
is
a
base
cowardly
scoundrel
has
not
courage
enough
to
avow
his
own
judgment
it
is
not
his
opinion
that
he
cares
about
but
only
the
secret
pleasures
of
wreaking
his
anger
without
being
found
out
or
this
will
also
have
been
goethe
opinion
as
he
was
generally
the
source
from
which
riemer
drew
his
observations
and
indeed
rousseau
maxim
applies
to
every
line
that
is
printed
would
a
man
in
a
mask
ever
be
allowed
to
harangue
a
mob
or
speak
in
any
assembly
and
that
too
when
he
was
going
to
attack
others
and
overwhelm
them
with
abuse

anonymity
is
the
refuge
for
all
literary
and
journalistic
rascality
it
is
a
practice
which
must
be
completely
stopped
every
article
even
in
a
newspaper
should
be
accompanied
by
the
name
of
its
author
and
the
editor
should
be
made
strictly
responsible
for
the
accuracy
of
the
signature
the
freedom
of
the
press
should
be
thus
far
restricted
so
that
when
a
man
publicly
proclaims
through
the
trumpet
of
the
newspaper
he
should
be
answerable
for
it
at
any
rate
with
his
honor
if
he
has
any
and
if
he
has
none
let
his
name
neutralize
the
effect
of
his
words
and
since
even
the
most
insignificant
person
is
known
in
his
own
circle
the
result
of
such
a
measure
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
of
the
newspaper
lies
and
to
restrain
the
audacity
of
many
a
poisonous
tongue
on

writers
may
be
classified
as
meteors

a
meteor

moment
you
look
up
and
cry
and
it
is
gone
for
ever

and

last
a
much
longer
time
they
often
outshine
the
fixed
stars
and
are
confounded
with
them
by
the
inexperienced
but
this
only
because
they
are
near
it
is
not
long
before
they
must
yield
their
place
nay
the
light
they
give
is
reflected
only
and
the
sphere
of
their
influence
is
confined
to
their
own
orbit
their
contemporaries
their
path
is
one
of
change
and
movement
and
with
the
circuit
of
a
few
years
their
tale
is
told
fixed
stars
are
the
only
ones
that
are
constant
their
position
in
the
firmament
is
secure
they
shine
with
a
light
of
their
own
their
effect
is
the
same
as
it
was
yesterday
because
having
no
parallax
their
appearance
does
not
alter
with
a
difference
in
our
standpoint
they
belong
not
to
system
nation
only
but
to
the
universe
and
just
because
they
are
so
very
far
away
it
is
usually
many
years
before
their
light
is
visible
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
earth
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
chapter
that
where
a
man
merits
are
of
a
high
order
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
win
reputation
because
the
public
is
uncritical
and
lacks
discernment
but
another
and
no
less
serious
hindrance
to
fame
comes
from
the
envy
it
has
to
encounter
for
even
in
the
lowest
kinds
of
work
envy
balks
even
the
beginnings
of
a
reputation
and
never
ceases
to
cleave
to
it
up
to
the
last
how
great
a
part
is
played
by
envy
in
the
wicked
ways
of
the
world
ariosto
is
right
in
saying
that
the
dark
side
of
our
mortal
life
predominates
so
full
it
is
of
this
evil
assai
più
oscura
che
serena
vita
mortal
tutta
for
envy
is
the
moving
spirit
of
that
secret
and
informal
though
flourishing
alliance
everywhere
made
by
mediocrity
against
individual
eminence
no
matter
of
what
kind
in
his
own
sphere
of
work
no
one
will
allow
another
to
be
distinguished
he
is
an
intruder
who
can
not
be
tolerated
excelle
parmi

this
is
the
universal
password
of
the
in
addition
then
to
the
rarity
of
true
merit
and
the
difficulty
it
has
in
being
understood
and
recognized
there
is
the
envy
of
thousands
to
be
reckoned
with
all
of
them
bent
on
suppressing
nay
on
smothering
it
altogether
no
one
is
taken
for
what
he
is
but
for
what
others
make
of
him
and
this
is
the
handle
used
by
mediocrity
to
keep
down
distinction
by
not
letting
it
come
up
as
long
as
that
can
possibly
be
prevented
there
are
two
ways
of
behaving
in
regard
to
merit
either
to
have
some
of
one
own
or
to
refuse
any
to
others
the
latter
method
is
more
convenient
and
so
it
is
generally
adopted
as
envy
is
a
mere
sign
of
deficiency
so
to
envy
merit
argues
the
lack
of
it
my
excellent
balthazar
gracian
has
given
a
very
fine
account
of
this
relation
between
envy
and
merit
in
a
lengthy
fable
which
may
be
found
in
his
under
the
heading
de
he
describes
all
the
birds
as
meeting
together
and
conspiring
against
the
peacock
because
of
his
magnificent
feathers
said
the
magpie
could
only
manage
to
put
a
stop
to
the
cursed
parading
of
his
tail
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
his
beauty
for
what
is
not
seen
is
as
good
as
what
does
not
this
explains
how
modesty
came
to
be
a
virtue
it
was
invented
only
as
a
protection
against
envy
that
there
have
always
been
rascals
to
urge
this
virtue
and
to
rejoice
heartily
over
the
bashfulness
of
a
man
of
merit
has
been
shown
at
length
in
my
chief
work
in
i
find

which

who

but
it
has
its
prototype
in
cervantes
who
includes
in
his
up
certain
rules
of
conduct
for
poets
and
amongst
them
the
following
whose
verse
shows
him
to
be
a
poet
should
have
a
high
opinion
of
himself
relying
on
the
proverb
that
he
is
a
knave
who
thinks
himself

shakespeare
in
many
of
his
sonnets
which
gave
him
the
only
opportunity
he
had
of
speaking
of
himself
declares
with
a
confidence
equal
to
his
ingenuousness
that
what
he
writes
is
immortal

collier
one
of
his
critical
editors
in
his
introduction
to
the
sonettes
remarks
upon
this
point
in
many
of
them
are
to
be
found
most
remarkable
indications
of
and
of
assurance
in
the
immortality
of
his
verses
and
in
this
respect
the
opinion
was
constant
and
uniform
he
never
scruples
to
express
it
and
perhaps
there
is
no
writer
of
ancient
or
modern
times
who
for
the
quantity
of
such
writings
left
behind
him
has
so
frequently
or
so
strongly
declared
that
what
he
had
produced
in
this
department
of
poetry
world
would
not
willingly
let
die
a
method
of
underrating
good
work
often
used
by
envy
in
reality
however
only
the
obverse
side
of
it
consists
in
the
dishonorable
and
unscrupulous
laudation
of
the
bad
for
no
sooner
does
bad
work
gain
currency
than
it
draws
attention
from
the
good
but
however
effective
this
method
may
be
for
a
while
especially
if
it
is
applied
on
a
large
scale
the
day
of
reckoning
comes
at
last
and
the
fleeting
credit
given
to
bad
work
is
paid
off
by
the
lasting
discredit
which
overtakes
those
who
abjectly
praised
it
hence
these
critics
prefer
to
remain
anonymous
a
like
fate
threatens
though
more
remotely
those
who
depreciate
and
censure
good
work
and
consequently
many
are
too
prudent
to
attempt
it
but
there
is
another
way
and
when
a
man
of
eminent
merit
appears
the
first
effect
he
produces
is
often
only
to
pique
all
his
rivals
just
as
the
peacock
tail
offended
the
birds
this
reduces
them
to
a
deep
silence
and
their
silence
is
so
unanimous
that
it
savors
of
preconcertion
their
tongues
are
all
paralyzed
it
is
the
described
by
seneca
this
malicious
silence
which
is
technically
known
as
may
for
a
long
time
interfere
with
the
growth
of
reputation
if
as
happens
in
the
higher
walks
of
learning
where
a
man
immediate
audience
is
wholly
composed
of
rival
workers
and
professed
students
who
then
form
the
channel
of
his
fame
the
greater
public
is
obliged
to
use
its
suffrage
without
being
able
to
examine
the
matter
for
itself
and
if
in
the
end
that
malicious
silence
is
broken
in
upon
by
the
voice
of
praise
it
will
be
but
seldom
that
this
happens
entirely
apart
from
some
ulterior
aim
pursued
by
those
who
thus
manipulate
justice
for
as
goethe
says
in
the
a
man
can
get
no
recognition
either
from
many
persons
or
from
only
one

it
is

abroad

credit

allow
to
another
man
engaged
in
work
similar
to
your
own

akin
to
it
must
at
bottom
be
withdrawn
from
yourself
and
you
can
praise
him
only
at
the
expense
of
your
own
claims
accordingly
mankind
is
in
itself
not
at
all
inclined
to
award
praise
and
reputation
it
is
more
disposed
to
blame
and
find
fault
whereby
it
indirectly
praises
itself
if
notwithstanding
this
praise
is
won
from
mankind
some
extraneous
motive
must
prevail
i
am
not
here
referring
to
the
disgraceful
way
in
which
mutual
friends
will
puff
one
another
into
a
reputation
outside
of
that
an
effectual
motive
is
supplied
by
the
feeling
that
next
to
the
merit
of
doing
something
oneself
comes
that
of
correctly
appreciating
and
recognizing
what
others
have
done
this
accords
with
the
threefold
division
of
heads
drawn
up
by
hesiod
and
afterwards
by
machiavelli
says
the
latter
the
capacities
of
mankind
three
varieties
one
man
will
understand
a
thing
by
himself
another
so
far
as
it
is
explained
to
him
a
third
neither
of
himself
nor
when
it
is
put
clearly
before
he
then
who
abandons
hope
of
making
good
his
claims
to
the
first
class
will
be
glad
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
taking
a
place
in
the
second
it
is
almost
wholly
owing
to
this
state
of
things
that
merit
may
always
rest
assured
of
ultimately
meeting
with
recognition
footnote
and
footnote
ch
to
this
also
is
due
the
fact
that
when
the
value
of
a
work
has
once
been
recognized
and
may
no
longer
be
concealed
or
denied
all
men
vie
in
praising
and
honoring
it
simply
because
they
are
conscious
of
thereby
doing
themselves
an
honor
they
act
in
the
spirit
of
xenophon
remark
must
be
a
wise
man
who
knows
what
is
so
when
they
see
that
the
prize
of
original
merit
is
for
ever
out
of
their
reach
they
hasten
to
possess
themselves
of
that
which
comes
second
best
the
correct
appreciation
of
it
here
it
happens
as
with
an
army
which
has
been
forced
to
yield
when
just
as
previously
every
man
wanted
to
be
foremost
in
the
fight
so
now
every
man
tries
to
be
foremost
in
running
away
they
all
hurry
forward
to
offer
their
applause
to
one
who
is
now
recognized
to
be
worthy
of
praise
in
virtue
of
a
recognition
as
a
rule
unconscious
of
that
law
of
homogeneity
which
i
mentioned
in
the
last

so
that
it
may
seem
as
though
their
way
of
thinking
and
looking
at
things
were
homogeneous
with
that
of
the
celebrated
man
and
that
they
may
at
least
save
the
honor
of
their
literary
taste
since
nothing
else
is
left
them
from
this
it
is
plain
that
whereas
it
is
very
difficult
to
win
fame
it
is
not
hard
to
keep
it
when
once
attained
and
also
that
a
reputation
which
comes
quickly
does
not
last
very
long
for
here
too
cito
fit
cito
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
ordinary
average
man
can
easily
recognize
and
the
rival
workers
willingly
acknowledge
the
value
of
any
performance
it
will
not
stand
very
much
above
the
capacity
of
either
of
them
to
achieve
it
for
themselves
quisque
laudat
quantum
se
posse
sperat
a
man
will
praise
a
thing
only
so
far
as
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
imitate
it
himself
further
it
is
a
suspicious
sign
if
a
reputation
comes
quickly
for
an
application
of
the
laws
of
homogeneity
will
show
that
such
a
reputation
is
nothing
but
the
direct
applause
of
the
multitude
what
this
means
may
be
seen
by
a
remark
once
made
by
phocion
when
he
was
interrupted
in
a
speech
by
the
loud
cheers
of
the
mob
turning
to
his
friends
who
were
standing
close
by
he
asked
i
made
a
mistake
and
said
something
stupid
footnote
plutarch
contrarily
a
reputation
that
is
to
last
a
long
time
must
be
slow
in
maturing
and
the
centuries
of
its
duration
have
generally
to
be
bought
at
the
cost
of
contemporary
praise
for
that
which
is
to
keep
its
position
so
long
must
be
of
a
perfection
difficult
to
attain
and
even
to
recognize
this
perfection
requires
men
who
are
not
always
to
be
found
and
never
in
numbers
sufficiently
great
to
make
themselves
heard
whereas
envy
is
always
on
the
watch
and
doing
its
best
to
smother
their
voice
but
with
moderate
talent
which
soon
meets
with
recognition
there
is
the
danger
that
those
who
possess
it
will
outlive
both
it
and
themselves
so
that
a
youth
of
fame
may
be
followed
by
an
old
age
of
obscurity
in
the
case
of
great
merit
on
the
other
hand
a
man
may
remain
unknown
for
many
years
but
make
up
for
it
later
on
by
attaining
a
brilliant
reputation
and
if
it
should
be
that
this
comes
only
after
he
is
no
more
well
he
is
to
be
reckoned
amongst
those
of
whom
jean
paul
says
that
extreme
unction
is
their
baptism
he
may
console
himself
by
thinking
of
the
saints
who
also
are
canonized
only
after
they
are
dead
thus
what
mahlmann
has
said
so
well
in
holds
good
in
this
world
truly
great
work
never
pleases
at
once
and
the
god
set
up
by
the
multitude
keeps
his
place
on
the
altar
but
a
short
time

footnote
august
mahlmann
journalist
poet
and
his
vor
is
a
parody
of
kotzebue
vor
it
is
worth
mention
that
this
rule
is
most
directly
confirmed
in
the
case
of
pictures
where
as
connoisseurs
well
know
the
greatest
masterpieces
are
not
the
first
to
attract
attention
if
they
make
a
deep
impression
it
is
not
after
one
but
only
after
repeated
inspection
but
then
they
excite
more
and
more
admiration
every
time
they
are
seen
moreover
the
chances
that
any
given
work
will
be
quickly
and
rightly
appreciated
depend
upon
two
conditions
firstly
the
character
of
the
work
whether
high
or
low
in
other
words
easy
or
difficult
to
understand
and
secondly
the
kind
of
public
it
attracts
whether
large
or
small
this
latter
condition
is
no
doubt
in
most
instances
a
corollary
of
the
former
but
it
also
partly
depends
upon
whether
the
work
in
question
admits
like
books
and
musical
compositions
of
being
produced
in
great
numbers
by
the
compound
action
of
these
two
conditions
achievements
which
serve
no
materially
useful
end
and
these
alone
are
under
consideration
here
will
vary
in
regard
to
the
chances
they
have
of
meeting
with
timely
recognition
and
due
appreciation
and
the
order
of
precedence
beginning
with
those
who
have
the
greatest
chance
will
be
somewhat
as
follows
acrobats
circus
riders
jugglers
actors
singers
musicians
composers
poets
both
the
last
on
account
of
the
multiplication
of
their
works
architects
painters
sculptors
philosophers
the
last
place
of
all
is
unquestionably
taken
by
philosophers
because
their
works
are
meant
not
for
entertainment
but
for
instruction
and
because
they
presume
some
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
reader
and
require
him
to
make
an
effort
of
his
own
to
understand
them
this
makes
their
public
extremely
small
and
causes
their
fame
to
be
more
remarkable
for
its
length
than
for
its
breadth
and
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
the
possibility
of
a
man
fame
lasting
a
long
time
stands
in
almost
inverse
ratio
with
the
chance
that
it
will
be
early
in
making
its
appearance
so
that
as
regards
length
of
fame
the
above
order
of
precedence
may
be
reversed
but
then
the
poet
and
the
composer
will
come
in
the
end
to
stand
on
the
same
level
as
the
philosopher
since
when
once
a
work
is
committed
to
writing
it
is
possible
to
preserve
it
to
all
time
however
the
first
place
still
belongs
by
right
to
the
philosopher
because
of
the
much
greater
scarcity
of
good
work
in
this
sphere
and
the
high
importance
of
it
and
also
because
of
the
possibility
it
offers
of
an
almost
perfect
translation
into
any
language
sometimes
indeed
it
happens
that
a
philosopher
fame
outlives
even
his
works
themselves
as
has
happened
with
thales
empedocles
heraclitus
democritus
parmenides
epicurus
and
many
others
my
remarks
are
as
i
have
said
confined
to
achievements
that
are
not
of
any
material
use
work
that
serves
some
practical
end
or
ministers
directly
to
some
pleasure
of
the
senses
will
never
have
any
difficulty
in
being
duly
appreciated
no
could
long
remain
obscure
in
any
town
to
say
nothing
of
having
to
appeal
to
posterity
under
fame
of
rapid
growth
is
also
to
be
reckoned
fame
of
a
false
and
artificial
kind
where
for
instance
a
book
is
worked
into
a
reputation
by
means
of
unjust
praise
the
help
of
friends
corrupt
criticism
prompting
from
above
and
collusion
from
below
all
this
tells
upon
the
multitude
which
is
rightly
presumed
to
have
no
power
of
judging
for
itself
this
sort
of
fame
is
like
a
swimming
bladder
by
its
aid
a
heavy
body
may
keep
afloat
it
bears
up
for
a
certain
time
long
or
short
according
as
the
bladder
is
well
sewed
up
and
blown
but
still
the
air
comes
out
gradually
and
the
body
sinks
this
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
all
works
which
are
famous
by
reason
of
something
outside
of
themselves
false
praise
dies
away
collusion
comes
to
an
end
critics
declare
the
reputation
ungrounded
it
vanishes
and
is
replaced
by
so
much
the
greater
contempt
contrarily
a
genuine
work
which
having
the
source
of
its
fame
in
itself
can
kindle
admiration
afresh
in
every
age
resembles
a
body
of
low
specific
gravity
which
always
keeps
up
of
its
own
accord
and
so
goes
floating
down
the
stream
of
time
men
of
great
genius
whether
their
work
be
in
poetry
philosophy
or
art
stand
in
all
ages
like
isolated
heroes
keeping
up
a
desperate
struggling
against
the
onslaught
of
an
army
of
opponents
is
not
this
characteristic
of
the
miserable
nature
of
mankind
the
dullness
grossness
perversity
silliness
and
brutality
of
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
race
are
always
an
obstacle
to
the
efforts
of
the
genius
whatever
be
the
method
of
his
art
they
so
form
that
hostile
army
to
which
at
last
he
has
to
succumb
let
the
isolated
champion
achieve
what
he
may
it
is
slow
to
be
acknowledged
it
is
late
in
being
appreciated
and
then
only
on
the
score
of
authority
it
may
easily
fall
into
neglect
again
at
any
rate
for
a
while
ever
afresh
it
finds
itself
opposed
by
false
shallow
and
insipid
ideas
which
are
better
suited
to
that
large
majority
that
so
generally
hold
the
field
though
the
critic
may
step
forth
and
say
like
hamlet
when
he
held
up
the
two
portraits
to
his
wretched
mother
you
eyes
have
you
alas
they
have
none
when
i
watch
the
behavior
of
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
presence
of
some
great
master
work
and
mark
the
manner
of
their
applause
they
often
remind
me
of
trained
monkeys
in
a
show
the
monkey
gestures
are
no
doubt
much
like
those
of
men
but
now
and
again
they
betray
that
the
real
inward
spirit
of
these
gestures
is
not
in
them
their
irrational
nature
peeps
out
footnote
at
this
point
schopenhauer
interrupts
the
thread
of
his
discourse
to
speak
at
length
upon
an
example
of
false
fame
those
who
are
at
all
acquainted
with
the
philosopher
views
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
writer
thus
held
up
to
scorn
is
hegel
and
readers
of
the
other
volumes
in
this
series
will
with
the
translator
have
had
by
now
quite
enough
of
the
subject
the
passage
is
therefore
omitted
it
is
often
said
of
a
man
that
is
in
advance
of
his
and
it
follows
from
the
above
remarks
that
this
must
be
taken
to
mean
that
he
is
in
advance
of
humanity
in
general
just
because
of
this
fact
a
genius
makes
no
direct
appeal
except
to
those
who
are
too
rare
to
allow
of
their
ever
forming
a
numerous
body
at
any
one
period
if
he
is
in
this
respect
not
particularly
favored
by
fortune
he
will
be
by
his
own
in
other
words
he
will
remain
unaccepted
until
time
gradually
brings
together
the
voices
of
those
few
persons
who
are
capable
of
judging
a
work
of
such
high
character
then
posterity
will
say
man
was
in
advance
of
his
instead
of
advance
of
because
humanity
will
be
glad
to
lay
the
burden
of
its
own
faults
upon
a
single
epoch
hence
if
a
man
has
been
superior
to
his
own
age
he
would
also
have
been
superior
to
any
other
provided
that
in
that
age
by
some
rare
and
happy
chance
a
few
just
men
capable
of
judging
in
the
sphere
of
his
achievements
had
been
born
at
the
same
time
with
him
just
as
when
according
to
a
beautiful
indian
myth
vischnu
becomes
incarnate
as
a
hero
so
too
brahma
at
the
same
time
appears
as
the
singer
of
his
deeds
and
hence
valmiki
vyasa
and
kalidasa
are
incarnations
of
brahma
in
this
sense
then
it
may
be
said
that
every
immortal
work
puts
its
age
to
the
proof
whether
or
no
it
will
be
able
to
recognize
the
merit
of
it
as
a
rule
the
men
of
any
age
stand
such
a
test
no
better
than
the
neighbors
of
philemon
and
baucis
who
expelled
the
deities
they
failed
to
recognize
accordingly
the
right
standard
for
judging
the
intellectual
worth
of
any
generation
is
supplied
not
by
the
great
minds
that
make
their
appearance
in
it
for
their
capacities
are
the
work
of
nature
and
the
possibility
of
cultivating
them
a
matter
of
chance
circumstance
but
by
the
way
in
which
contemporaries
receive
their
works
whether
i
mean
they
give
their
applause
soon
and
with
a
will
or
late
and
in
niggardly
fashion
or
leave
it
to
be
bestowed
altogether
by
posterity
this
last
fate
will
be
especially
reserved
for
works
of
a
high
character
for
the
happy
chance
mentioned
above
will
be
all
the
more
certain
not
to
come
in
proportion
as
there
are
few
to
appreciate
the
kind
of
work
done
by
great
minds
herein
lies
the
immeasurable
advantage
possessed
by
poets
in
respect
of
reputation
because
their
work
is
accessible
to
almost
everyone
if
it
had
been
possible
for
sir
walter
scott
to
be
read
and
criticised
by
only
some
hundred
persons
perhaps
in
his
any
common
scribbler
would
have
been
preferred
to
him
and
afterwards
when
he
had
taken
his
proper
place
it
would
also
have
been
said
in
his
honor
that
he
was
advance
of
his
but
if
envy
dishonesty
and
the
pursuit
of
personal
aims
are
added
to
the
incapacity
of
those
hundred
persons
who
in
the
name
of
their
generation
are
called
upon
to
pass
judgment
on
a
work
then
indeed
it
meets
with
the
same
sad
fate
as
attends
a
suitor
who
pleads
before
a
tribunal
of
judges
one
and
all
corrupt
in
corroboration
of
this
we
find
that
the
history
of
literature
generally
shows
all
those
who
made
knowledge
and
insight
their
goal
to
have
remained
unrecognized
and
neglected
whilst
those
who
paraded
with
the
vain
show
of
it
received
the
admiration
of
their
contemporaries
together
with
the
emoluments
the
effectiveness
of
an
author
turns
chiefly
upon
his
getting
the
reputation
that
he
should
be
read
but
by
practicing
various
arts
by
the
operation
of
chance
and
by
certain
natural
affinities
this
reputation
is
quickly
won
by
a
hundred
worthless
people
while
a
worthy
writer
may
come
by
it
very
slowly
and
tardily
the
former
possess
friends
to
help
them
for
the
rabble
is
always
a
numerous
body
which
holds
well
together
the
latter
has
nothing
but
enemies
because
intellectual
superiority
is
everywhere
and
under
all
circumstances
the
most
hateful
thing
in
the
world
and
especially
to
bunglers
in
the
same
line
of
work
who
want
to
pass
for
something
themselves
footnote
if
the
professors
of
philosophy
should
chance
to
think
that
i
am
here
hinting
at
them
and
the
tactics
they
have
for
more
than
thirty
years
pursued
toward
my
works
they
have
hit
the
nail
upon
the
head
this
being
so
it
is
a
prime
condition
for
doing
any
great
work
any
work
which
is
to
outlive
its
own
age
that
a
man
pay
no
heed
to
his
contemporaries
their
views
and
opinions
and
the
praise
or
blame
which
they
bestow
this
condition
is
however
fulfilled
of
itself
when
a
man
really
does
anything
great
and
it
is
fortunate
that
it
is
so
for
if
in
producing
such
a
work
he
were
to
look
to
the
general
opinion
or
the
judgment
of
his
colleagues
they
would
lead
him
astray
at
every
step
hence
if
a
man
wants
to
go
down
to
posterity
he
must
withdraw
from
the
influence
of
his
own
age
this
will
of
course
generally
mean
that
he
must
also
renounce
any
influence
upon
it
and
be
ready
to
buy
centuries
of
fame
by
foregoing
the
applause
of
his
contemporaries
for
when
any
new
and
truth
comes
into
the
world
and
if
it
is
new
it
must
be
paradoxical
an
obstinate
stand
will
be
made
against
it
as
long
as
possible
nay
people
will
continue
to
deny
it
even
after
they
slacken
their
opposition
and
are
almost
convinced
of
its
truth
meanwhile
it
goes
on
quietly
working
its
way
and
like
an
acid
undermining
everything
around
it
from
time
to
time
a
crash
is
heard
the
old
error
comes
tottering
to
the
ground
and
suddenly
the
new
fabric
of
thought
stands
revealed
as
though
it
were
a
monument
just
uncovered
everyone
recognizes
and
admires
it
to
be
sure
this
all
comes
to
pass
for
the
most
part
very
slowly
as
a
rule
people
discover
a
man
to
be
worth
listening
to
only
after
he
is
gone
their
resounds
when
the
orator
has
left
the
platform
works
of
the
ordinary
type
meet
with
a
better
fate
arising
as
they
do
in
the
course
of
and
in
connection
with
the
general
advance
in
contemporary
culture
they
are
in
close
alliance
with
the
spirit
of
their
age
in
other
words
just
those
opinions
which
happen
to
be
prevalent
at
the
time
they
aim
at
suiting
the
needs
of
the
moment
if
they
have
any
merit
it
is
soon
recognized
and
they
gain
currency
as
books
which
reflect
the
latest
ideas
justice
nay
more
than
justice
is
done
to
them
they
afford
little
scope
for
envy
since
as
was
said
above
a
man
will
praise
a
thing
only
so
far
as
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
imitate
it
himself
but
those
rare
works
which
are
destined
to
become
the
property
of
all
mankind
and
to
live
for
centuries
are
at
their
origin
too
far
in
advance
of
the
point
at
which
culture
happens
to
stand
and
on
that
very
account
foreign
to
it
and
the
spirit
of
their
own
time
they
neither
belong
to
it
nor
are
they
in
any
connection
with
it
and
hence
they
excite
no
interest
in
those
who
are
dominated
by
it
they
belong
to
another
a
higher
stage
of
culture
and
a
time
that
is
still
far
off
their
course
is
related
to
that
of
ordinary
works
as
the
orbit
of
uranus
to
the
orbit
of
mercury
for
the
moment
they
get
no
justice
done
to
them
people
are
at
a
loss
how
to
treat
them
so
they
leave
them
alone
and
go
their
own
snail
pace
for
themselves
does
the
worm
see
the
eagle
as
it
soars
aloft
of
the
number
of
books
written
in
any
language
about
one
in
forms
a
part
of
its
real
and
permanent
literature
what
a
fate
this
one
book
has
to
endure
before
it
outstrips
those
and
gains
its
due
place
of
honor
such
a
book
is
the
work
of
an
extraordinary
and
eminent
mind
and
therefore
it
is
specifically
different
from
the
others
a
fact
which
sooner
or
later
becomes
manifest
let
no
one
fancy
that
things
will
ever
improve
in
this
respect
no
the
miserable
constitution
of
humanity
never
changes
though
it
may
to
be
sure
take
somewhat
varying
forms
with
every
generation
a
distinguished
mind
seldom
has
its
full
effect
in
the
of
its
possessor
because
at
bottom
it
is
completely
and
properly
understood
only
by
minds
already
akin
to
it
as
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
even
one
man
out
of
many
millions
to
tread
the
path
that
leads
to
immortality
he
must
of
necessity
be
very
lonely
the
journey
to
posterity
lies
through
a
horribly
dreary
region
like
the
lybian
desert
of
which
as
is
well
known
no
one
has
any
idea
who
has
not
seen
it
for
himself
meanwhile
let
me
before
all
things
recommend
the
traveler
to
take
light
baggage
with
him
otherwise
he
will
have
to
throw
away
too
much
on
the
road
let
him
never
forget
the
words
of
balthazar
gracian
bueno
si
breve
dos
vezes
good
work
is
doubly
good
if
it
is
short
this
advice
is
specially
applicable
to
my
own
countrymen
compared
with
the
short
span
of
time
they
live
men
of
great
intellect
are
like
huge
buildings
standing
on
a
small
plot
of
ground
the
size
of
the
building
can
not
be
seen
by
anyone
just
in
front
of
it
nor
for
an
analogous
reason
can
the
greatness
of
a
genius
be
estimated
while
he
lives
but
when
a
century
has
passed
the
world
recognizes
it
and
wishes
him
back
again
if
the
perishable
son
of
time
has
produced
an
imperishable
work
how
short
his
own
life
seems
compared
with
that
of
his
child
he
is
like
semela
or
maia
a
mortal
mother
who
gave
birth
to
an
immortal
son
or
contrarily
he
is
like
achilles
in
regard
to
thetis
what
a
contrast
there
is
between
what
is
fleeting
and
what
is
permanent
the
short
span
of
a
man
life
his
necessitous
afflicted
unstable
existence
will
seldom
allow
of
his
seeing
even
the
beginning
of
his
immortal
child
brilliant
career
nor
will
the
father
himself
be
taken
for
that
which
he
really
is
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
a
man
whose
fame
comes
after
him
is
the
reverse
of
a
nobleman
who
is
preceded
by
it
however
the
only
difference
that
it
ultimately
makes
to
a
man
to
receive
his
fame
at
the
hands
of
contemporaries
rather
than
from
posterity
is
that
in
the
former
case
his
admirers
are
separated
from
him
by
space
and
in
the
latter
by
time
for
even
in
the
case
of
contemporary
fame
a
man
does
not
as
a
rule
see
his
admirers
actually
before
him
reverence
can
not
endure
close
proximity
it
almost
always
dwells
at
some
distance
from
its
object
and
in
the
presence
of
the
person
revered
it
melts
like
butter
in
the
sun
accordingly
if
a
man
is
celebrated
with
his
contemporaries
of
those
amongst
whom
he
lives
will
let
their
esteem
be
guided
by
his
rank
and
fortune
and
the
remaining
tenth
may
perhaps
have
a
dull
consciousness
of
his
high
qualities
because
they
have
heard
about
him
from
remote
quarters
there
is
a
fine
latin
letter
of
petrarch
on
this
incompatibility
between
reverence
and
the
presence
of
the
person
and
between
fame
and
life
it
comes
second
in
his
familiares
and
it
is
addressed
to
thomas
messanensis
he
there
observes
amongst
other
things
that
the
learned
men
of
his
age
all
made
it
a
rule
to
think
little
of
a
man
writings
if
they
had
even
once
seen
him
footnote
in
the
venetian
edition
of
since
distance
then
is
essential
if
a
famous
man
is
to
be
recognized
and
revered
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
distance
of
space
or
of
time
it
is
true
that
he
may
sometimes
hear
of
his
fame
in
the
one
case
but
never
in
the
other
but
still
genuine
and
great
merit
may
make
up
for
this
by
confidently
anticipating
its
posthumous
fame
nay
he
who
produces
some
really
great
thought
is
conscious
of
his
connection
with
coming
generations
at
the
very
moment
he
conceives
it
so
that
he
feels
the
extension
of
his
existence
through
centuries
and
thus
lives
posterity
as
well
as
it
and
when
after
enjoying
a
great
man
work
we
are
seized
with
admiration
for
him
and
wish
him
back
so
that
we
might
see
and
speak
with
him
and
have
him
in
our
possession
this
desire
of
ours
is
not
unrequited
for
he
too
has
had
his
longing
for
that
posterity
which
will
grant
the
recognition
honor
gratitude
and
love
denied
by
envious
contemporaries
if
intellectual
works
of
the
highest
order
are
not
allowed
their
due
until
they
come
before
the
tribunal
of
posterity
a
contrary
fate
is
prepared
for
certain
brilliant
errors
which
proceed
from
men
of
talent
and
appear
with
an
air
of
being
well
grounded
these
errors
are
defended
with
so
much
acumen
and
learning
that
they
actually
become
famous
with
their
own
age
and
maintain
their
position
at
least
during
their
author
lifetime
of
this
sort
are
many
false
theories
and
wrong
criticisms
also
poems
and
works
of
art
which
exhibit
some
false
taste
or
mannerism
favored
by
contemporary
prejudice
they
gain
reputation
and
currency
simply
because
no
one
is
yet
forthcoming
who
knows
how
to
refute
them
or
otherwise
prove
their
falsity
and
when
he
appears
as
he
usually
does
in
the
next
generation
the
glory
of
these
works
is
brought
to
an
end
posthumous
judges
be
their
decision
favorable
to
the
appellant
or
not
form
the
proper
court
for
quashing
the
verdict
of
contemporaries
that
is
why
it
is
so
difficult
and
so
rare
to
be
victorious
alike
in
both
tribunals
the
unfailing
tendency
of
time
to
correct
knowledge
and
judgment
should
always
be
kept
in
view
as
a
means
of
allaying
anxiety
whenever
any
grievous
error
appears
whether
in
art
or
science
or
practical
life
and
gains
ground
or
when
some
false
and
thoroughly
perverse
policy
of
movement
is
undertaken
and
receives
applause
at
the
hands
of
men
no
one
should
be
angry
or
still
less
despondent
but
simply
imagine
that
the
world
has
already
abandoned
the
error
in
question
and
now
only
requires
time
and
experience
to
recognize
of
its
own
accord
that
which
a
clear
vision
detected
at
the
first
glance
when
the
facts
themselves
are
eloquent
of
a
truth
there
is
no
need
to
rush
to
its
aid
with
words
for
time
will
give
it
a
thousand
tongues
how
long
it
may
be
before
they
speak
will
of
course
depend
upon
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
and
the
plausibility
of
the
error
but
come
they
will
and
often
it
would
be
of
no
avail
to
try
to
anticipate
them
in
the
worst
cases
it
will
happen
with
theories
as
it
happens
with
affairs
in
practical
life
where
sham
and
deception
emboldened
by
success
advance
to
greater
and
greater
lengths
until
discovery
is
made
almost
inevitable
it
is
just
so
with
theories
through
the
blind
confidence
of
the
blockheads
who
broach
them
their
absurdity
reaches
such
a
pitch
that
at
last
it
is
obvious
even
to
the
dullest
eye
we
may
thus
say
to
such
people
wilder
your
statements
the
there
is
also
some
comfort
to
be
found
in
reflecting
upon
all
the
whims
and
crotchets
which
had
their
day
and
have
now
utterly
vanished
in
style
in
grammar
in
spelling
there
are
false
notions
of
this
sort
which
last
only
three
or
four
years
but
when
the
errors
are
on
a
large
scale
while
we
lament
the
brevity
of
human
life
we
shall
in
any
case
do
well
to
lag
behind
our
own
age
when
we
see
it
on
a
downward
path
for
there
are
two
ways
of
not
keeping
on
a
level
with
the
times
a
man
may
be
below
it
or
he
may
be
above
it
on
genius
no
difference
of
rank
position
or
birth
is
so
great
as
the
gulf
that
separates
the
countless
millions
who
use
their
head
only
in
the
service
of
their
belly
in
other
words
look
upon
it
as
an
instrument
of
the
will
and
those
very
few
and
rare
persons
who
have
the
courage
to
say
no
it
is
too
good
for
that
my
head
shall
be
active
only
in
its
own
service
it
shall
try
to
comprehend
the
wondrous
and
varied
spectacle
of
this
world
and
then
reproduce
it
in
some
form
whether
as
art
or
as
literature
that
may
answer
to
my
character
as
an
individual
these
are
the
truly
noble
the
real
of
the
world
the
others
are
serfs
and
go
with
the
soil
of
course
i
am
here
referring
to
those
who
have
not
only
the
courage
but
also
the
call
and
therefore
the
right
to
order
the
head
to
quit
the
service
of
the
will
with
a
result
that
proves
the
sacrifice
to
have
been
worth
the
making
in
the
case
of
those
to
whom
all
this
can
only
partially
apply
the
gulf
is
not
so
wide
but
even
though
their
talent
be
small
so
long
as
it
is
real
there
will
always
be
a
sharp
line
of
demarcation
between
them
and
the
millions
footnote
the
correct
scale
for
adjusting
the
hierarchy
of
intelligences
is
furnished
by
the
degree
in
which
the
mind
takes
merely
individual
or
approaches
universal
views
of
things
the
brute
recognizes
only
the
individual
as
such
its
comprehension
does
not
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
the
individual
but
man
reduces
the
individual
to
the
general
herein
lies
the
exercise
of
his
reason
and
the
higher
his
intelligence
reaches
the
nearer
do
his
general
ideas
approach
the
point
at
which
they
become
universal
the
works
of
fine
art
poetry
and
philosophy
produced
by
a
nation
are
the
outcome
of
the
superfluous
intellect
existing
in
it
for
him
who
can
understand
aright
grano
the
relation
between
the
genius
and
the
normal
man
may
perhaps
be
best
expressed
as
follows
a
genius
has
a
double
intellect
one
for
himself
and
the
service
of
his
will
the
other
for
the
world
of
which
he
becomes
the
mirror
in
virtue
of
his
purely
objective
attitude
towards
it
the
work
of
art
or
poetry
or
philosophy
produced
by
the
genius
is
simply
the
result
or
quintessence
of
this
contemplative
attitude
elaborated
according
to
certain
technical
rules
the
normal
man
on
the
other
hand
has
only
a
single
intellect
which
may
be
called
by
contrast
with
the
intellect
of
genius
however
acute
this
subjective
intellect
may
be
and
it
exists
in
very
various
degrees
of
perfection
it
is
never
on
the
same
level
with
the
double
intellect
of
genius
just
as
the
open
chest
notes
of
the
human
voice
however
high
are
essentially
different
from
the
falsetto
notes
these
like
the
two
upper
octaves
of
the
flute
and
the
harmonics
of
the
violin
are
produced
by
the
column
of
air
dividing
itself
into
two
vibrating
halves
with
a
node
between
them
while
the
open
chest
notes
of
the
human
voice
and
the
lower
octave
of
the
flute
are
produced
by
the
undivided
column
of
air
vibrating
as
a
whole
this
illustration
may
help
the
reader
to
understand
that
specific
peculiarity
of
genius
which
is
unmistakably
stamped
on
the
works
and
even
on
the
physiognomy
of
him
who
is
gifted
with
it
at
the
same
time
it
is
obvious
that
a
double
intellect
like
this
must
as
a
rule
obstruct
the
service
of
the
will
and
this
explains
the
poor
capacity
often
shown
by
genius
in
the
conduct
of
life
and
what
specially
characterizes
genius
is
that
it
has
none
of
that
sobriety
of
temper
which
is
always
to
be
found
in
the
ordinary
simple
intellect
be
it
acute
or
dull
the
brain
may
be
likened
to
a
parasite
which
is
nourished
as
a
part
of
the
human
frame
without
contributing
directly
to
its
inner
economy
it
is
securely
housed
in
the
topmost
story
and
there
leads
a
and
independent
life
in
the
same
way
it
may
be
said
that
a
man
endowed
with
great
mental
gifts
leads
apart
from
the
individual
life
common
to
all
a
second
life
purely
of
the
intellect
he
devotes
himself
to
the
constant
increase
rectification
and
extension
not
of
mere
learning
but
of
real
systematic
knowledge
and
insight
and
remains
untouched
by
the
fate
that
overtakes
him
personally
so
long
as
it
does
not
disturb
him
in
his
work
it
is
thus
a
life
which
raises
a
man
and
sets
him
above
fate
and
its
changes
always
thinking
learning
experimenting
practicing
his
knowledge
the
man
soon
comes
to
look
upon
this
second
life
as
the
chief
mode
of
existence
and
his
merely
personal
life
as
something
subordinate
serving
only
to
advance
ends
higher
than
itself
an
example
of
this
independent
separate
existence
is
furnished
by
goethe
during
the
war
in
the
champagne
and
amid
all
the
bustle
of
the
camp
he
made
observations
for
his
theory
of
color
and
as
soon
as
the
numberless
calamities
of
that
war
allowed
of
his
retiring
for
a
short
time
to
the
fortress
of
luxembourg
he
took
up
the
manuscript
of
his
this
is
an
example
which
we
the
salt
of
the
earth
should
endeavor
to
follow
by
never
letting
anything
disturb
us
in
the
pursuit
of
our
intellectual
life
however
much
the
storm
of
the
world
may
invade
and
agitate
our
personal
environment
always
remembering
that
we
are
the
sons
not
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
free
as
our
emblem
and
coat
of
arms
i
propose
a
tree
mightily
shaken
by
the
wind
but
still
bearing
its
ruddy
fruit
on
every
branch
with
the
motto
convellor
or
sed
that
purely
intellectual
life
of
the
individual
has
its
counterpart
in
humanity
as
a
whole
for
there
too
the
real
life
is
the
life
of
the
both
in
the
empirical
and
in
the
transcendental
meaning
of
the
word
the
purely
intellectual
life
of
humanity
lies
in
its
effort
to
increase
knowledge
by
means
of
the
sciences
and
its
desire
to
perfect
the
arts
both
science
and
art
thus
advance
slowly
from
one
generation
to
another
and
grow
with
the
centuries
every
race
as
it
hurries
by
furnishing
its
contribution
this
intellectual
life
like
some
gift
from
heaven
hovers
over
the
stir
and
movement
of
the
world
or
it
is
as
it
were
a
air
developed
out
of
the
ferment
itself
the
real
life
of
mankind
dominated
by
will
and
side
by
side
with
the
history
of
nations
the
history
of
philosophy
science
and
art
takes
its
innocent
and
bloodless
way
the
difference
between
the
genius
and
the
ordinary
man
is
no
doubt
a
one
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
difference
of
degree
but
i
am
tempted
to
regard
it
also
as
in
view
of
the
fact
that
ordinary
minds
notwithstanding
individual
variation
have
a
certain
tendency
to
think
alike
thus
on
similar
occasions
their
thoughts
at
once
all
take
a
similar
direction
and
run
on
the
same
lines
and
this
explains
why
their
judgments
constantly
agree
not
however
because
they
are
based
on
truth
to
such
lengths
does
this
go
that
certain
fundamental
views
obtain
amongst
mankind
at
all
times
and
are
always
being
repeated
and
brought
forward
anew
whilst
the
great
minds
of
all
ages
are
in
open
or
secret
opposition
to
them
a
genius
is
a
man
in
whose
mind
the
world
is
presented
as
an
object
is
presented
in
a
mirror
but
with
a
degree
more
of
clearness
and
a
greater
distinction
of
outline
than
is
attained
by
ordinary
people
it
is
from
him
that
humanity
may
look
for
most
instruction
for
the
deepest
insight
into
the
most
important
matters
is
to
be
acquired
not
by
an
observant
attention
to
detail
but
by
a
close
study
of
things
as
a
whole
and
if
his
mind
reaches
maturity
the
instruction
he
gives
will
be
conveyed
now
in
one
form
now
in
another
thus
genius
may
be
defined
as
an
eminently
clear
consciousness
of
things
in
general
and
therefore
also
of
that
which
is
opposed
to
them
namely
one
own
self
the
world
looks
up
to
a
man
thus
endowed
and
expects
to
learn
something
about
life
and
its
real
nature
but
several
highly
favorable
circumstances
must
combine
to
produce
genius
and
this
is
a
very
rare
event
it
happens
only
now
and
then
let
us
say
once
in
a
century
that
a
man
is
born
whose
intellect
so
perceptibly
surpasses
the
normal
measure
as
to
amount
to
that
second
faculty
which
seems
to
be
accidental
as
it
is
out
of
all
relation
to
the
will
he
may
remain
a
long
time
without
being
recognized
or
appreciated
stupidity
preventing
the
one
and
envy
the
other
but
should
this
once
come
to
pass
mankind
will
crowd
round
him
and
his
works
in
the
hope
that
he
may
be
able
to
enlighten
some
of
the
darkness
of
their
existence
or
inform
them
about
it
his
message
is
to
some
extent
a
revelation
and
he
himself
a
higher
being
even
though
he
may
be
but
little
above
the
ordinary
standard
like
the
ordinary
man
the
genius
is
what
he
is
chiefly
for
himself
this
is
essential
to
his
nature
a
fact
which
can
neither
be
avoided
nor
altered
he
may
be
for
others
remains
a
matter
of
chance
and
of
secondary
importance
in
no
case
can
people
receive
from
his
mind
more
than
a
reflection
and
then
only
when
he
joins
with
them
in
the
attempt
to
get
his
thought
into
their
heads
where
however
it
is
never
anything
but
an
exotic
plant
stunted
and
frail
in
order
to
have
original
uncommon
and
perhaps
even
immortal
thoughts
it
is
enough
to
estrange
oneself
so
fully
from
the
world
of
things
for
a
few
moments
that
the
most
ordinary
objects
and
events
appear
quite
new
and
unfamiliar
in
this
way
their
true
nature
is
disclosed
what
is
here
demanded
can
not
perhaps
be
said
to
be
difficult
it
is
not
in
our
power
at
all
but
is
just
the
province
of
genius
by
itself
genius
can
produce
original
thoughts
just
as
little
as
a
woman
by
herself
can
bear
children
outward
circumstances
must
come
to
fructify
genius
and
be
as
it
were
a
father
to
its
progeny
the
mind
of
genius
is
among
other
minds
what
the
carbuncle
is
among
precious
stones
it
sends
forth
light
of
its
own
while
the
others
reflect
only
that
which
they
have
received
the
relation
of
the
genius
to
the
ordinary
mind
may
also
be
described
as
that
of
an
body
to
one
which
merely
is
a
conductor
of
electricity
the
mere
man
of
learning
who
spends
his
life
in
teaching
what
he
has
learned
is
not
strictly
to
be
called
a
man
of
genius
just
as
bodies
are
not
conductors
nay
genius
stands
to
mere
learning
as
the
words
to
the
music
in
a
song
a
man
of
learning
is
a
man
who
has
learned
a
great
deal
a
man
of
genius
one
from
whom
we
learn
something
which
the
genius
has
learned
from
nobody
great
minds
of
which
there
is
scarcely
one
in
a
hundred
millions
are
thus
the
lighthouses
of
humanity
and
without
them
mankind
would
lose
itself
in
the
boundless
sea
of
monstrous
error
and
bewilderment
and
so
the
simple
man
of
learning
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
the
ordinary
professor
for
instance
looks
upon
the
genius
much
as
we
look
upon
a
hare
which
is
good
to
eat
after
it
has
been
killed
and
dressed
up
so
long
as
it
is
alive
it
is
only
good
to
shoot
at
he
who
wishes
to
experience
gratitude
from
his
contemporaries
must
adjust
his
pace
to
theirs
but
great
things
are
never
produced
in
this
way
and
he
who
wants
to
do
great
things
must
direct
his
gaze
to
posterity
and
in
firm
confidence
elaborate
his
work
for
coming
generations
no
doubt
the
result
may
be
that
he
will
remain
quite
unknown
to
his
contemporaries
and
comparable
to
a
man
who
compelled
to
spend
his
life
upon
a
lonely
island
with
great
effort
sets
up
a
monument
there
to
transmit
to
future
the
knowledge
of
his
existence
if
he
thinks
it
a
hard
fate
let
him
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
ordinary
man
who
lives
for
practical
aims
only
often
suffers
a
like
fate
without
having
any
compensation
to
hope
for
inasmuch
as
he
may
under
favorable
conditions
spend
a
life
of
material
production
earning
buying
building
fertilizing
laying
out
founding
establishing
beautifying
with
daily
effort
and
unflagging
zeal
and
all
the
time
think
that
he
is
working
for
himself
and
yet
in
the
end
it
is
his
descendants
who
reap
the
benefit
of
it
all
and
sometimes
not
even
his
descendants
it
is
the
same
with
the
man
of
genius
he
too
hopes
for
his
reward
and
for
honor
at
least
and
at
last
finds
that
he
has
worked
for
posterity
alone
both
to
be
sure
have
inherited
a
great
deal
from
their
ancestors
the
compensation
i
have
mentioned
as
the
privilege
of
genius
lies
not
in
what
it
is
to
others
but
in
what
it
is
to
itself
what
man
has
in
any
real
sense
lived
more
than
he
whose
moments
of
thought
make
their
echoes
heard
through
the
tumult
of
centuries
perhaps
after
all
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
a
genius
to
attain
undisturbed
possession
of
himself
by
spending
his
life
in
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
his
own
thoughts
his
own
works
and
by
admitting
the
world
only
as
the
heir
of
his
ample
existence
then
the
world
would
find
the
mark
of
his
existence
only
after
his
death
as
it
finds
that
of
the
ichnolith
footnote
for
an
illustration
of
this
feeling
in
poetry
schopenhauer
refers
the
reader
to
byron
of
introd
to
c
it
is
not
only
in
the
activity
of
his
highest
powers
that
the
genius
surpasses
ordinary
people
a
man
who
is
unusually
supple
and
agile
will
perform
all
his
movements
with
exceptional
ease
even
with
comfort
because
he
takes
a
direct
pleasure
in
an
activity
for
which
he
is
particularly
and
therefore
often
exercises
it
without
any
object
further
if
he
is
an
acrobat
or
a
dancer
not
only
does
he
take
leaps
which
other
people
can
not
execute
but
he
also
betrays
rare
elasticity
and
agility
in
those
easier
steps
which
others
can
also
perform
and
even
in
ordinary
walking
in
the
same
way
a
man
of
superior
mind
will
not
only
produce
thoughts
and
works
which
could
never
have
come
from
another
it
will
not
be
here
alone
that
he
will
show
his
greatness
but
as
knowledge
and
thought
form
a
mode
of
activity
natural
and
easy
to
him
he
will
also
delight
himself
in
them
at
all
times
and
so
apprehend
small
matters
which
are
within
the
range
of
other
minds
more
easily
quickly
and
correctly
than
they
thus
he
will
take
a
direct
and
lively
pleasure
in
every
increase
of
knowledge
every
problem
solved
every
witty
thought
whether
of
his
own
or
another
and
so
his
mind
will
have
no
further
aim
than
to
be
constantly
active
this
will
be
an
inexhaustible
spring
of
delight
and
boredom
that
spectre
which
haunts
the
ordinary
man
can
never
come
near
him
then
too
the
masterpieces
of
past
and
contemporary
men
of
genius
exist
in
their
fullness
for
him
alone
if
a
great
product
of
genius
is
recommended
to
the
ordinary
simple
mind
it
will
take
as
much
pleasure
in
it
as
the
victim
of
gout
receives
in
being
invited
to
a
ball
the
one
goes
for
the
sake
of
formality
and
the
other
reads
the
book
so
as
not
to
be
in
arrear
for
la
bruyère
was
quite
right
when
he
said
the
wit
in
the
world
is
lost
upon
him
who
has
the
whole
range
of
thought
of
a
man
of
talent
or
of
a
genius
compared
with
the
thoughts
of
the
common
man
is
even
when
directed
to
objects
essentially
the
same
like
a
brilliant
full
of
life
compared
with
a
mere
outline
or
a
weak
sketch
in
all
this
is
part
of
the
reward
of
genius
and
compensates
him
for
a
lonely
existence
in
a
world
with
which
he
has
nothing
in
common
and
no
sympathies
but
since
size
is
relative
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
whether
i
say
caius
was
a
great
man
or
caius
has
to
live
amongst
wretchedly
small
people
for
brobdingnack
and
lilliput
vary
only
in
the
point
from
which
they
start
however
great
then
however
admirable
or
instructive
a
long
posterity
may
think
the
author
of
immortal
works
during
his
lifetime
he
will
appear
to
his
contemporaries
small
wretched
and
insipid
in
proportion
this
is
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
as
there
are
three
hundred
degrees
from
the
base
of
a
tower
to
the
summit
so
there
are
exactly
three
hundred
from
the
summit
to
the
base
great
minds
thus
owe
little
ones
some
indulgence
for
it
is
only
in
virtue
of
these
little
minds
that
they
themselves
are
great
let
us
then
not
be
surprised
if
we
find
men
of
genius
generally
unsociable
and
repellent
it
is
not
their
want
of
sociability
that
is
to
blame
their
path
through
the
world
is
like
that
of
a
man
who
goes
for
a
walk
on
a
bright
summer
morning
he
gazes
with
delight
on
the
beauty
and
freshness
of
nature
but
he
has
to
rely
wholly
on
that
for
entertainment
for
he
can
find
no
society
but
the
peasants
as
they
bend
over
the
earth
and
cultivate
the
soil
it
is
often
the
case
that
a
great
mind
prefers
soliloquy
to
the
dialogue
he
may
have
in
this
world
if
he
condescends
to
it
now
and
then
the
hollowness
of
it
may
possibly
drive
him
back
to
his
soliloquy
for
in
forgetfulness
of
his
interlocutor
or
caring
little
whether
he
understands
or
not
he
talks
to
him
as
a
child
talks
to
a
doll
modesty
in
a
great
mind
would
no
doubt
be
pleasing
to
the
world
but
unluckily
it
is
a
in
it
would
compel
a
genius
to
give
the
thoughts
and
opinions
nay
even
the
method
and
style
of
the
million
preference
over
his
own
to
set
a
higher
value
upon
them
and
wide
apart
as
they
are
to
bring
his
views
into
harmony
with
theirs
or
even
suppress
them
altogether
so
as
to
let
the
others
hold
the
field
in
that
case
however
he
would
either
produce
nothing
at
all
or
else
his
achievements
would
be
just
upon
a
level
with
theirs
great
genuine
and
extraordinary
work
can
be
done
only
in
so
far
as
its
author
disregards
the
method
the
thoughts
the
opinions
of
his
contemporaries
and
quietly
works
on
in
spite
of
their
criticism
on
his
side
despising
what
they
praise
no
one
becomes
great
without
arrogance
of
this
sort
should
his
life
and
work
fall
upon
a
time
which
can
not
recognize
and
appreciate
him
he
is
at
any
rate
true
to
himself
like
some
noble
traveler
forced
to
pass
the
night
in
a
miserable
inn
when
morning
comes
he
contentedly
goes
his
way
a
poet
or
philosopher
should
have
no
fault
to
find
with
his
age
if
it
only
permits
him
to
do
his
work
undisturbed
in
his
own
corner
nor
with
his
fate
if
the
corner
granted
him
allows
of
his
following
his
vocation
without
having
to
think
about
other
people
for
the
brain
to
be
a
mere
laborer
in
the
service
of
the
belly
is
indeed
the
common
lot
of
almost
all
those
who
do
not
live
on
the
work
of
their
hands
and
they
are
far
from
being
discontented
with
their
lot
but
it
strikes
despair
into
a
man
of
great
mind
whose
goes
beyond
the
measure
necessary
for
the
service
of
the
will
and
he
prefers
if
need
be
to
live
in
the
narrowest
circumstances
so
long
as
they
afford
him
the
free
use
of
his
time
for
the
development
and
application
of
his
faculties
in
other
words
if
they
give
him
the
leisure
which
is
invaluable
to
him
it
is
otherwise
with
ordinary
people
for
them
leisure
has
no
value
in
itself
nor
is
it
indeed
without
its
dangers
as
these
people
seem
to
know
the
technical
work
of
our
time
which
is
done
to
an
unprecedented
perfection
has
by
increasing
and
multiplying
objects
of
luxury
given
the
favorites
of
fortune
a
choice
between
more
leisure
and
culture
upon
the
one
side
and
additional
luxury
and
good
living
but
with
increased
activity
upon
the
other
and
true
to
their
character
they
choose
the
latter
and
prefer
champagne
to
freedom
and
they
are
consistent
in
their
choice
for
to
them
every
exertion
of
the
mind
which
does
not
serve
the
aims
of
the
will
is
folly
intellectual
effort
for
its
own
sake
they
call
eccentricity
therefore
persistence
in
the
aims
of
the
will
and
the
belly
will
be
concentricity
and
to
be
sure
the
will
is
the
centre
the
kernel
of
the
world
but
in
general
it
is
very
seldom
that
any
such
alternative
is
presented
for
as
with
money
most
men
have
no
superfluity
but
only
just
enough
for
their
needs
so
with
intelligence
they
possess
just
what
will
suffice
for
the
service
of
the
will
that
is
for
the
carrying
on
of
their
business
having
made
their
fortune
they
are
content
to
gape
or
to
indulge
in
sensual
pleasures
or
childish
amusements
cards
or
dice
or
they
will
talk
in
the
dullest
way
or
dress
up
and
make
obeisance
to
one
another
and
how
few
are
those
who
have
even
a
little
superfluity
of
intellectual
power
like
the
others
they
too
make
themselves
a
pleasure
but
it
is
a
pleasure
of
the
intellect
either
they
will
pursue
some
liberal
study
which
brings
them
in
nothing
or
they
will
practice
some
art
and
in
general
they
will
be
capable
of
taking
an
objective
interest
in
things
so
that
it
will
be
possible
to
converse
with
them
but
with
the
others
it
is
better
not
to
enter
into
any
relations
at
all
for
except
when
they
tell
the
results
of
their
own
experience
or
give
an
account
of
their
special
vocation
or
at
any
rate
impart
what
they
have
learned
from
some
one
else
their
conversation
will
not
be
worth
listening
to
and
if
anything
is
said
to
them
they
will
rarely
grasp
or
understand
it
aright
and
it
will
in
most
cases
be
opposed
to
their
own
opinions
balthazar
gracian
describes
them
very
strikingly
as
men
who
are
not
men
che
non
lo
and
giordano
bruno
the
same
thing
a
difference
there
is
in
having
to
do
with
men
compared
with
those
who
are
only
made
in
their
image
and
and
how
wonderfully
this
passage
agrees
with
that
remark
in
the
kurral
common
people
look
like
men
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
quite
like
if
the
reader
will
consider
the
extent
to
which
these
ideas

and

he
can
not
doubt
but
that
they
are
at
one
with
the
facts
of
life
it
was
certainly
not
under
the
influence
of
those
passages
that
about
twenty
years
ago
i
tried
to
get
a
made
the
lid
of
which
should
have
two
fine
chestnuts
represented
upon
it
if
possible
in
mosaic
together
with
a
leaf
which
was
to
show
that
they
were
this
symbol
was
meant
to
keep
the
thought
constantly
before
my
mind
if
anyone
wishes
for
entertainment
such
as
will
prevent
him
feeling
solitary
even
when
he
is
alone

me

moral
and

qualities
may
almost
afford
delight
and
gratification

still
we
should
always
be
careful
to
avoid
being

i
am
often
surprised
by
the
cleverness
and
now
and
again
by
the
stupidity
of
my
dog
and
i
have
similar
experiences
with
mankind
countless
times
in
indignation
at
their
incapacity
their
total
lack
of
discernment
their
bestiality
i
have
been
forced
to
echo
the
old
complaint
that
folly
is
the
mother
and
the
nurse
of
the
human
race
generis
mater
nutrixque
profecto
stultitia
but
at
other
times
i
have
been
astounded
that
from
such
a
race
there
could
have
gone
forth
so
many
arts
and
sciences
abounding
in
so
much
use
and
beauty
even
though
it
has
always
been
the
few
that
produce
them
yet
these
arts
and
sciences
have
struck
root
established
and
perfected
themselves
and
the
race
has
with
persistent
fidelity
preserved
homer
plato
horace
and
others
for
thousands
of
years
by
copying
and
treasuring
their
writings
thus
saving
them
from
oblivion
in
spite
of
all
the
evils
and
atrocities
that
have
happened
in
the
world
thus
the
race
has
proved
that
it
appreciates
the
value
of
these
things
and
at
the
same
time
it
can
form
a
correct
view
of
special
achievements
or
estimate
signs
of
judgment
and
intelligence
when
this
takes
place
amongst
those
who
belong
to
the
great
multitude
it
is
by
a
kind
of
inspiration
sometimes
a
correct
opinion
will
be
formed
by
the
multitude
itself
but
this
is
only
when
the
chorus
of
praise
has
grown
full
and
complete
it
is
then
like
the
sound
of
untrained
voices
where
there
are
enough
of
them
it
is
always
harmonious
those
who
emerge
from
the
multitude
those
who
are
called
men
of
genius
are
merely
the
of
the
whole
human
race
they
achieve
that
which
others
could
not
possibly
achieve
their
originality
is
so
great
that
not
only
is
their
divergence
from
others
obvious
but
their
individuality
is
expressed
with
such
force
that
all
the
men
of
genius
who
have
ever
existed
show
every
one
of
them
peculiarities
of
character
and
mind
so
that
the
gift
of
his
works
is
one
which
he
alone
of
all
men
could
ever
have
presented
to
the
world
this
is
what
makes
that
simile
of
ariosto
so
true
and
so
justly
celebrated
lo
fece
e
poi

lo
after
nature
stamps
a
man
of
genius
she
breaks
the
die
but
there
is
always
a
limit
to
human
capacity
and
no
one
can
be
a
great
genius
without
having
some
decidedly
weak
side
it
may
even
be
some
intellectual
narrowness
in
other
words
there
will
foe
some
faculty
in
which
he
is
now
and
then
inferior
to
men
of
moderate
endowments
it
will
be
a
faculty
which
if
strong
might
have
been
an
obstacle
to
the
exercise
of
the
qualities
in
which
he
excels
what
this
weak
point
is
it
will
always
be
hard
to
define
with
any
accuracy
even
in
a
given
case
it
may
be
better
expressed
indirectly
thus
plato
weak
point
is
exactly
that
in
which
aristotle
is
strong
and
and
so
too
kant
is
deficient
just
where
goethe
is
great
now
mankind
is
fond
of
venerating
something
but
its
veneration
is
generally
directed
to
the
wrong
object
and
it
remains
so
directed
until
posterity
comes
to
set
it
right
but
the
educated
public
is
no
sooner
set
right
in
this
than
the
honor
which
is
due
to
genius
degenerates
just
as
the
honor
which
the
faithful
pay
to
their
saints
easily
passes
into
a
frivolous
worship
of
relics
thousands
of
christians
adore
the
relics
of
a
saint
whose
life
and
doctrine
are
unknown
to
them
and
the
religion
of
thousands
of
buddhists
lies
more
in
veneration
of
the
holy
tooth
or
some
such
object
or
the
vessel
that
contains
it
or
the
holy
bowl
or
the
fossil
footstep
or
the
holy
tree
which

and

these

are

with

and

by
many
who
have
never
read
their
works
they
can
not
do
anything
more
than
just
gape
the
intelligent
amongst
them
are
moved
by
the
wish
to
see
the
objects
which
the
great
man
habitually
had
before
his
eyes
and
by
a
strange
illusion
these
produce
the
mistaken
notion
that
with
the
objects
they
are
bringing
back
the
man
himself
or
that
something
of
him
must
cling
to
them
akin
to
such
people
are
those
who
earnestly
strive
to
acquaint
themselves
with
the
of
a
poet
works
or
to
unravel
the
personal
circumstances
and
events
in
his
life
which
have
suggested
particular
passages
this
is
as
though
the
audience
in
a
theatre
were
to
admire
a
fine
scene
and
then
rush
upon
the
stage
to
look
at
the
scaffolding
that
supports
it
there
are
in
our
day
enough
instances
of
these
critical
investigators
and
they
prove
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
mankind
is
interested
not
in
the
of
a
work
that
is
in
its
manner
of
treatment
but
in
its
actual
matter
all
it
cares
for
is
the
theme
to
read
a
philosopher
biography
instead
of
studying
his
thoughts
is
like
neglecting
a
picture
and
attending
only
to
the
style
of
its
frame
debating
whether
it
is
carved
well
or
ill
and
how
much
it
cost
to
gild
it
this
is
all
very
well
however
there
is
another
class
of
persons
whose
interest
is
also
directed
to
material
and
personal
considerations
but
they
go
much
further
and
carry
it
to
a
point
where
it
becomes
absolutely
futile
because
a
great
man
has
opened
up
to
them
the
treasures
of
his
inmost
being
and
by
a
supreme
effort
of
his
faculties
produced
works
which
not
only
redound
to
their
elevation
and
enlightenment
but
will
also
benefit
their
posterity
to
the
tenth
and
twentieth
generation
because
he
has
presented
mankind
with
a
matchless
gift
these
varlets
think
themselves
justified
in
sitting
in
judgment
upon
his
personal
morality
and
trying
if
they
can
not
discover
here
or
there
some
spot
in
him
which
will
soothe
the
pain
they
feel
at
the
sight
of
so
great
a
mind
compared
with
the
overwhelming
feeling
of
their
own
nothingness
this
is
the
real
source
of
all
those
prolix
discussions
carried
on
in
countless
books
and
reviews
on
the
moral
aspect
of
goethe
life
and
whether
he
ought
not
to
have
married
one
or
other
of
the
girls
with
whom
he
fell
in
love
in
his
young
days
whether
again
instead
of
honestly
devoting
himself
to
the
service
of
his
master
he
should
not
have
been
a
man
of
the
people
a
german
patriot
worthy
of
a
seat
in
the
and
so
on
such
crying
ingratitude
and
malicious
detraction
prove
that
these
judges
are
as
great
knaves
morally
as
they
are
intellectually
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
a
man
of
talent
will
strive
for
money
and
reputation
but
the
spring
that
moves
genius
to
the
production
of
its
works
is
not
as
easy
to
name
wealth
is
seldom
its
reward
nor
is
it
reputation
or
glory
only
a
frenchman
could
mean
that
glory
is
such
an
uncertain
thing
and
if
you
look
at
it
closely
of
so
little
value
besides
it
never
corresponds
to
the
effort
you
have
made
tuo
nunquam
est
par
fama
nor
again
is
it
exactly
the
pleasure
it
gives
you
for
this
is
almost
outweighed
by
the
greatness
of
the
effort
it
is
rather
a
peculiar
kind
of
instinct
which
drives
the
man
of
genius
to
give
permanent
form
to
what
he
sees
and
feels
without
being
conscious
of
any
further
motive
it
works
in
the
main
by
a
necessity
similar
to
that
which
makes
a
tree
bear
its
fruit
and
no
external
condition
is
needed
but
the
ground
upon
which
it
is
to
thrive
on
a
closer
examination
it
seems
as
though
in
the
case
of
a
genius
the
will
to
live
which
is
the
spirit
of
the
human
species
were
conscious
of
having
by
some
rare
chance
and
for
a
brief
period
attained
a
greater
clearness
of
vision
and
were
now
trying
to
secure
it
or
at
least
the
outcome
of
it
for
the
whole
species
to
which
the
individual
genius
in
his
inmost
being
belongs
so
that
the
light
which
he
sheds
about
him
may
pierce
the
darkness
and
dullness
of
ordinary
human
consciousness
and
there
produce
some
good
effect
arising
in
some
such
way
this
instinct
drives
the
genius
to
carry
his
work
to
completion
without
thinking
of
reward
or
applause
or
sympathy
to
leave
all
care
for
his
own
personal
welfare
to
make
his
life
one
of
industrious
solitude
and
to
strain
his
faculties
to
the
utmost
he
thus
comes
to
think
more
about
posterity
than
about
contemporaries
because
while
the
latter
can
only
lead
him
astray
posterity
forms
the
majority
of
the
species
and
time
will
gradually
bring
the
discerning
few
who
can
appreciate
him
meanwhile
it
is
with
him
as
with
the
artist
described
by
goethe
he
has
no
princely
patron
to
prize
his
talents
no
friend
to
rejoice
with
him
fürst
der
die
talente
schätzt
ein
freund
der
sich
mit
mir
ergötzt
die
haben
leider
mir
his
work
is
as
it
were
a
sacred
object
and
the
true
fruit
of
his
life
and
his
aim
in
storing
it
away
for
a
more
discerning
posterity
will
be
to
make
it
the
property
of
mankind
an
aim
like
this
far
surpasses
all
others
and
for
it
he
wears
the
crown
of
thorns
which
is
one
day
to
bloom
into
a
wreath
of
laurel
all
his
powers
are
concentrated
in
the
effort
to
complete
and
secure
his
work
just
as
the
insect
in
the
last
stage
of
its
development
uses
its
whole
strength
on
behalf
of
a
brood
it
will
never
live
to
see
it
puts
its
eggs
in
some
place
of
safety
where
as
it
well
knows
the
young
will
one
day
find
life
and
nourishment
and
then
dies
in
confidence
