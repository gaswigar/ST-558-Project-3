extensive

not

any

that
the

was
renewed
a
swift
crashing
of
horses
through
the
tall
reeds
a
heavy
fall
a
despairing
cry
from
the
dying
steed
there
staggered
up
its
rider
a
slender
girl
in
sandals
and
girdled
tunic
her
dark
hair
fell
over
her
white
shoulders
her
eyes
were
those
of
a
trapped
animal
she
did
not
look
at
the
jungle
of
reeds
that
hemmed
in
the
little
clearing
nor
at
the
blue
waters
that
lapped
the
low
shore
behind
her
her
gaze
was
fixed
in
agonized
intensity
on
the
horseman
who
pushed
through
the
reedy
screen
and
dismounted
before
her
he
was
a
tall
man
slender
but
hard
as
steel
from
head
to
heel
he
was
clad
in
light
silvered
that
fitted
his
supple
form
like
a
glove
from
under
the
helmet
his
brown
eyes
regarded
her
mockingly
back
her
voice
shrilled
with
terror
me
not
shah
amurath
or
i
will
throw
myself
into
the
water
and
drown
he
laughed
and
his
laughter
was
like
the
purr
of
a
sword
sliding
from
a
silken
sheath
you
will
not
drown
olivia
daughter
of
confusion
for
the
marge
is
too
shallow
and
i
can
catch
you
before
you
can
reach
the
deeps
you
gave
me
a
merry
chase
by
the
gods
and
all
my
men
are
far
behind
us
but
there
is
no
horse
west
of
vilayet
that
can
distance
irem
for
long
he
nodded
at
the
tall
desert
stallion
behind
him
me
go
begged
the
girl
tears
of
despair
staining
her
face
i
not
suffered
enough
is
there
any
humiliation
pain
or
degradation
you
have
not
heaped
on
me
how
long
must
my
torment
last
long
as
i
find
pleasure
in
your
whimperings
your
pleas
tears
and
writhings
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
would
have
seemed
gentle
to
a
stranger
are
strangely
virile
olivia
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
weary
of
you
as
i
have
always
wearied
of
women
before
you
are
ever
fresh
and
unsullied
in
spite
of
me
each
new
day
with
you
brings
a
new
delight
come
let
us
return
to
akif
where
the
people
are
still
feting
the
conqueror
of
the
miserable
while
he
the
conqueror
is
engaged
in
recapturing
a
wretched
fugitive
a
foolish
lovely
idiotic
runaway
she
recoiled
turning
toward
the
waters
lapping
bluely
among
the
reeds
his
flash
of
open
anger
was
like
a
spark
struck
from
flint
with
a
quickness
her
tender
limbs
could
not
approximate
he
caught
her
wrist
twisting
it
in
pure
wanton
cruelty
until
she
screamed
and
sank
to
her
knees
i
should
drag
you
back
to
akif
at
my
horse
tail
but
i
will
be
merciful
and
carry
you
on
my
for
which
favor
you
shall
humbly
thank
me
while
he
released
her
with
a
startled
oath
and
sprang
back
his
saber
flashing
out
as
a
terrible
apparition
burst
from
the
reedy
jungle
sounding
an
inarticulate
cry
of
hate
olivia
staring
up
from
the
ground
saw
what
she
took
to
be
either
a
savage
or
a
madman
advancing
on
shah
amurath
in
an
attitude
of
deadly
menace
he
was
powerfully
built
naked
but
for
a
girdled
loincloth
which
was
stained
with
blood
and
crusted
with
dried
mire
his
black
mane
was
matted
with
mud
and
clotted
blood
there
were
streaks
of
dried
blood
on
his
chest
and
limbs
dried
blood
on
the
long
straight
sword
he
gripped
in
his
right
hand
from
under
the
tangle
of
his
locks
bloodshot
eyes
glared
like
coals
of
blue
fire
hyrkanian
dog
mouthed
this
apparition
in
a
barbarous
accent
devils
of
vengeance
have
brought
you
here
ejaculated
shah
amurath
recoiling
did
not
know
a
dog
of
you
escaped
i
thought
you
all
lay
stiff
on
the
steppe
by
ilbars
river
but
me
damn
you
cried
the
other
i
dreamed
of
such
a
meeting
as
this
while
i
crawled
on
my
belly
through
the
brambles
or
lay
under
rocks
while
the
ants
gnawed
my
flesh
or
crouched
in
the
mire
up
to
my
mouth
i
dreamed
but
never
hoped
it
would
come
to
pass
oh
gods
of
hell
how
i
have
yearned
for
this
the
stranger
bloodthirsty
joy
was
terrible
to
behold
his
jaws
champed
spasmodically
froth
appeared
on
his
blackened
lips
back
ordered
shah
amurath
watching
him
narrowly
it
was
like
the
bark
of
a
timber
wolf
amurath
the
great
lord
of
akif
oh
damn
you
how
i
love
the
sight
of
you
you
who
fed
my
comrades
to
the
vultures
who
tore
them
between
wild
horses
blinded
and
maimed
and
mutilated
them
you
dog
you
filthy
dog
his
voice
rose
to
a
maddened
scream
and
he
charged
in
spite
of
the
terror
of
his
wild
appearance
olivia
looked
to
see
him
fall
at
the
first
crossing
of
the
blades
madman
or
savage
what
could
he
do
naked
against
the
mailed
chief
of
akif
there
was
an
instant
when
the
blades
flamed
and
licked
seeming
barely
to
touch
each
other
and
leap
apart
then
the
broadsword
flashed
past
the
saber
and
descended
terrifically
on
shah
amurath
shoulder
olivia
cried
out
at
the
fury
of
that
stroke
above
the
crunch
of
the
rending
mail
she
distinctly
heard
the
snap
of
the
the
hyrkanian
reeled
back
suddenly
ashen
blood
spurting
over
the
links
of
his
hauberk
his
saber
slipped
from
his
nerveless
fingers
he
gasped
there
was
a
quiver
of
frenzy
in
the
stranger
voice
such
as
you
gave
us
you
swine
olivia
closed
her
eyes
this
was
no
longer
battle
but
butchery
frantic
bloody
impelled
by
an
hysteria
of
fury
and
hate
in
which
culminated
the
sufferings
of
battle
massacre
torture
and
flight
though
olivia
knew
that
shah
amurath
deserved
no
mercy
or
pity
from
any
living
creature
yet
she
closed
her
eyes
and
pressed
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
that
dripping
sword
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
sound
of
a
butcher
cleaver
and
the
gurgling
cries
that
dwindled
away
and
ceased
she
opened
her
eyes
to
see
the
stranger
turning
away
from
a
gory
travesty
that
only
vaguely
resembled
a
human
being
the
man
breast
heaved
with
exhaustion
or
passion
his
brow
was
beaded
with
sweat
his
right
hand
was
splashed
with
blood
he
did
not
speak
to
her
or
even
glance
toward
her
she
saw
him
stride
through
the
reeds
that
grew
at
the
water
edge
stoop
and
tug
at
something
a
boat
wallowed
out
of
its
among
the
stalks
then
she
divined
his
intention
and
was
galvanized
into
action
wait
she
wailed
staggering
up
and
running
toward
him
not
leave
me
take
me
with
you
he
wheeled
and
stared
at
her
there
was
a
difference
in
his
bearing
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
sane
it
was
as
if
the
blood
he
had
just
shed
had
quenched
the
fire
of
his
frenzy
are
you
he
demanded
am
called
olivia
i
was
captive
i
ran
away
he
followed
me
that
why
he
came
here
oh
do
not
leave
me
here
his
warriors
are
not
far
behind
him
they
will
find
his
corpse
they
will
find
me
near
it
oh
she
moaned
in
her
terror
and
wrung
her
white
hands
he
stared
at
her
in
perplexity
you
be
better
off
with
me
he
demanded
am
a
barbarian
and
i
know
from
your
looks
that
you
fear
me
i
fear
you
she
replied
too
distracted
to
dissemble
flesh
crawls
at
the
horror
of
your
aspect
but
i
fear
the
hyrkanians
more
oh
let
me
go
with
you
they
will
put
me
to
the
torture
if
they
find
me
beside
their
dead
lord
then
he
drew
aside
and
she
stepped
quickly
into
the
boat
shrinking
from
contact
with
him
she
seated
herself
in
the
bow
and
he
stepped
into
the
boat
pushed
off
with
an
oar
and
using
it
as
a
paddle
worked
his
way
tortuously
among
the
tall
stalks
until
they
glided
out
into
open
water
then
he
set
to
work
with
both
oars
rowing
with
great
smooth
even
strokes
the
heavy
muscles
of
arms
and
shoulders
and
back
rippling
in
rhythm
to
his
exertions
there
was
silence
for
some
time
the
girl
crouching
in
the
bows
the
man
tugging
at
the
oars
she
watched
him
with
timorous
fascination
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
an
hyrkanian
and
he
did
not
resemble
the
hyborian
races
there
was
a
wolfish
hardness
about
him
that
marked
the
barbarian
his
features
allowing
for
the
strains
and
stains
of
battle
and
his
hiding
in
the
marshes
reflected
that
same
untamed
wildness
but
they
were
neither
evil
nor
degenerate
are
you
she
asked
amurath
called
you
a
were
you
of
that
band
am
conan
of
cimmeria
he
grunted
was
with
the
as
the
hyrkanian
dogs
called
us
she
knew
vaguely
that
the
land
he
named
lay
far
to
the
northwest
beyond
the
farthest
boundaries
of
the
different
kingdoms
of
her
race
am
a
daughter
of
the
king
of
ophir
she
said
father
sold
me
to
a
shemite
chief
because
i
would
not
marry
a
prince
of
koth
the
cimmerian
grunted
in
surprize
her
lips
twisted
in
a
bitter
smile
civilized
men
sell
their
children
as
slaves
to
savages
sometimes
they
call
your
race
barbaric
conan
of
cimmeria
do
not
sell
our
children
he
growled
his
chin
jutting
truculently
i
was
sold
but
the
desert
man
did
not
misuse
me
he
wished
to
buy
the
good
will
of
shah
amurath
and
i
was
among
the
gifts
he
brought
to
akif
of
the
purple
gardens
then
she
shuddered
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
should
be
lost
to
all
shame
she
said
presently
each
memory
stings
me
like
a
slaver
whip
i
abode
in
shah
amurath
palace
until
some
weeks
agone
he
rode
out
with
his
hosts
to
do
battle
with
a
band
of
invaders
who
were
ravaging
the
borders
of
turan
yesterday
he
returned
in
triumph
and
a
great
fete
was
made
to
honor
him
in
the
drunkenness
and
rejoicing
i
found
an
opportunity
to
steal
out
of
the
city
on
a
stolen
horse
i
had
thought
to
escape
but
he
followed
and
about
midday
came
up
with
me
i
outran
his
vassals
but
him
i
could
not
escape
then
you
came
was
lying
hid
in
the
reeds
grunted
the
barbarian
was
one
of
those
dissolute
rogues
the
free
companions
who
burned
and
looted
along
the
borders
there
were
five
thousand
of
us
from
a
score
of
races
and
tribes
we
had
been
serving
as
mercenaries
for
a
rebel
prince
in
eastern
koth
most
of
us
and
when
he
made
peace
with
his
cursed
sovereign
we
were
out
of
employment
so
we
took
to
plundering
the
outlying
dominions
of
koth
zamora
and
turan
impartially
a
week
ago
shah
amurath
trapped
us
near
the
banks
of
ilbars
with
fifteen
thousand
men
mitra
the
skies
were
black
with
vultures
when
the
lines
broke
after
a
whole
day
of
fighting
some
tried
to
break
through
to
the
north
some
to
the
west
i
doubt
if
any
escaped
the
steppes
were
covered
with
horsemen
riding
down
the
fugitives
i
broke
for
the
east
and
finally
reached
the
edge
of
the
marshes
that
border
this
part
of
vilayet
been
hiding
in
the
morasses
ever
since
only
the
day
before
yesterday
the
riders
ceased
beating
up
the
searching
for
just
such
fugitives
as
i
squirmed
and
burrowed
and
hidden
like
a
snake
feasting
on
i
caught
and
ate
raw
for
lack
of
fire
to
cook
them
this
dawn
i
found
this
boat
hidden
among
the
reeds
i
intended
going
out
on
the
sea
until
night
but
after
i
killed
shah
amurath
i
knew
his
mailed
dogs
would
be
close
at
hand
what
now
shall
doubtless
be
pursued
if
they
fail
to
see
the
marks
left
by
the
boat
which
i
covered
as
well
as
i
could
they
guess
anyway
that
we
took
to
sea
after
they
fail
to
find
us
among
the
marshes
but
we
have
a
start
and
i
going
to
haul
at
these
oars
until
we
reach
a
safe
place
shall
we
find
that
she
asked
hopelessly
is
an
hyrkanian
pond
folk
do
think
so
grinned
conan
grimly
the
slaves
that
have
escaped
from
galleys
and
become
pirates
what
are
your
plans
southwestern
shore
is
held
by
the
hyrkanians
for
hundreds
of
miles
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
pass
beyond
their
northern
boundaries
i
intend
to
go
northward
until
i
think
we
have
passed
them
then
we
turn
westward
and
try
to
land
on
the
shore
bordered
by
the
uninhabited
steppes
we
meet
pirates
or
a
storm
she
asked
we
shall
starve
on
the
steppes
he
reminded
her
did
ask
you
to
come
with
me
am
sorry
she
bowed
her
shapely
dark
head
storms
starvation
they
are
all
kinder
than
the
people
of
turan
his
dark
face
grew
somber
have
done
with
them
yet
be
at
ease
girl
storms
are
rare
on
vilayet
at
this
time
of
year
if
we
make
the
steppes
we
shall
not
starve
i
was
reared
in
a
naked
land
it
was
those
cursed
marshes
with
their
stench
and
stinging
flies
that
nigh
unmanned
me
i
am
at
home
in
the
high
lands
as
for
pirates
he
grinned
enigmatically
and
bent
to
the
oars
the
sun
sank
like
a
copper
ball
into
a
lake
of
fire
the
blue
of
the
sea
merged
with
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
both
turned
to
soft
dark
velvet
clustered
with
stars
and
the
mirrors
of
stars
olivia
reclined
in
the
bows
of
the
gently
rocking
boat
in
a
state
dreamy
and
unreal
she
experienced
an
illusion
that
she
was
floating
in
midair
stars
beneath
her
as
well
as
above
her
silent
companion
was
etched
vaguely
against
the
softer
darkness
there
was
no
break
or
falter
in
the
rhythm
of
his
oars
he
might
have
been
a
fantasmal
oarsman
rowing
her
across
the
dark
lake
of
death
but
the
edge
of
her
fear
was
dulled
and
lulled
by
the
monotony
of
motion
she
passed
into
a
quiet
slumber
dawn
was
in
her
eyes
when
she
awakened
aware
of
a
ravenous
hunger
it
was
a
change
in
the
motion
of
the
boat
that
had
roused
her
conan
was
resting
on
his
oars
gazing
beyond
her
she
realized
that
he
had
rowed
all
night
without
pause
and
marvelled
at
his
iron
endurance
she
twisted
about
to
follow
his
stare
and
saw
a
green
wall
of
trees
and
shrubbery
rising
from
the
water
edge
and
sweeping
away
in
a
wide
curve
enclosing
a
small
bay
whose
waters
lay
still
as
blue
glass
is
one
of
the
many
islands
that
dot
this
inland
sea
said
conan
are
supposed
to
be
uninhabited
i
heard
the
hyrkanians
seldom
visit
them
besides
they
generally
hug
the
shores
in
their
galleys
and
we
have
come
a
long
way
before
sunset
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
mainland
with
a
few
strokes
he
brought
the
boat
in
to
shore
and
made
the
painter
fast
to
the
arching
root
of
a
tree
which
rose
from
the
water
edge
stepping
ashore
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
help
olivia
she
took
it
wincing
slightly
at
the
bloodstains
upon
it
feeling
a
hint
of
the
dynamic
strength
that
lurked
in
the
barbarian
thews
a
dreamy
quiet
lay
over
the
woods
that
bordered
the
blue
bay
then
somewhere
far
back
among
the
trees
a
bird
lifted
its
morning
song
a
breeze
whispered
through
the
leaves
and
set
them
to
murmuring
olivia
found
herself
listening
intently
for
something
she
knew
not
what
what
might
be
lurking
amid
those
nameless
woodlands
as
she
peered
timidly
into
the
shadows
between
the
trees
something
swept
into
the
sunlight
with
a
swift
whirl
of
wings
a
great
parrot
which
dropped
on
to
a
leafy
branch
and
swayed
there
a
gleaming
image
of
jade
and
crimson
it
turned
its
crested
head
sidewise
and
regarded
the
invaders
with
glittering
eyes
of
jet
muttered
the
cimmerian
is
the
grandfather
of
all
parrots
he
must
be
a
thousand
years
old
look
at
the
evil
wisdom
of
his
eyes
what
mysteries
do
you
guard
wise
devil
abruptly
the
bird
spread
its
flaming
wings
and
soaring
from
its
perch
cried
out
harshly
yok
tha
xuthalla
and
with
a
wild
screech
of
horribly
human
laughter
rushed
away
through
the
trees
to
vanish
in
the
opalescent
shadows
olivia
stared
after
it
feeling
the
cold
hand
of
nameless
foreboding
touch
her
supple
spine
did
it
say
she
whispered
words
i
swear
answered
conan
in
what
tongue
i
say
i
returned
the
girl
it
must
have
learned
them
from
human
lips
human
or
she
gazed
into
the
leafy
fastness
and
shuddered
slightly
without
knowing
why
i
hungry
grunted
the
cimmerian
could
eat
a
whole
buffalo
we
look
for
fruit
but
first
i
going
to
cleanse
myself
of
this
dried
mud
and
blood
hiding
in
marshes
is
foul
business
so
saying
he
laid
aside
his
sword
and
wading
out
into
the
blue
water
went
about
his
ablutions
when
he
emerged
his
bronze
limbs
shone
his
streaming
black
mane
was
no
longer
matted
his
blue
eyes
though
they
smoldered
with
unquenchable
fire
were
no
longer
murky
or
bloodshot
but
the
tigerish
suppleness
of
limb
and
the
dangerous
aspect
of
feature
were
not
altered
strapping
on
his
sword
once
more
he
motioned
the
girl
to
follow
him
and
they
left
the
shore
passing
under
the
leafy
arches
of
the
great
branches
underfoot
lay
a
short
green
sward
which
cushioned
their
tread
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
they
caught
glimpses
of
vistas
presently
conan
grunted
in
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
golden
and
russet
globes
hanging
in
clusters
among
the
leaves
indicating
that
the
girl
should
seat
herself
on
a
fallen
tree
he
filled
her
lap
with
the
exotic
delicacies
and
then
himself
fell
to
with
unconcealed
gusto
said
he
between
mouthfuls
ilbars
i
have
lived
on
rats
and
roots
i
dug
out
of
the
stinking
mud
this
is
sweet
to
the
palate
though
not
very
filling
still
it
will
serve
if
we
eat
enough
olivia
was
too
busy
to
reply
the
sharp
edge
of
the
cimmerian
hunger
blunted
he
began
to
gaze
at
his
fair
companion
with
more
interest
than
previously
noting
the
lustrous
clusters
of
her
dark
hair
the
tints
of
her
dainty
skin
and
the
rounded
contours
of
her
lithe
figure
which
the
scanty
silk
tunic
displayed
to
full
advantage
finishing
her
meal
the
object
of
his
scrutiny
looked
up
and
meeting
his
burning
gaze
she
changed
color
and
the
remnants
of
the
fruit
slipped
from
her
fingers
without
comment
he
indicated
with
a
gesture
that
they
should
continue
their
explorations
and
rising
she
followed
him
out
of
the
trees
and
into
a
glade
the
farther
end
of
which
was
bounded
by
a
dense
thicket
as
they
stepped
into
the
open
there
was
a
ripping
crash
in
this
thicket
and
conan
bounding
aside
and
carrying
the
girl
with
him
narrowly
saved
them
from
something
that
rushed
through
the
air
and
struck
a
with
a
thunderous
impact
whipping
out
his
sword
conan
bounded
across
the
glade
and
plunged
into
the
thicket
silence
ensued
while
olivia
crouched
on
the
sward
terrified
and
bewildered
presently
conan
emerged
a
puzzled
scowl
on
his
face
in
that
thicket
he
growled
there
was
something
he
studied
the
missile
that
had
so
narrowly
missed
them
and
grunted
incredulously
as
if
unable
to
credit
his
own
senses
it
was
a
huge
block
of
greenish
stone
which
lay
on
the
sward
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
whose
wood
its
impact
had
splintered
strange
stone
to
find
on
an
uninhabited
island
growled
conan
olivia
lovely
eyes
dilated
in
wonder
the
stone
was
a
symmetrical
block
indisputably
cut
and
shaped
by
human
hands
and
it
was
astonishingly
massive
the
cimmerian
grasped
it
with
both
hands
and
with
legs
braced
and
the
muscles
standing
out
on
his
arms
and
back
in
straining
knots
he
heaved
it
above
his
head
and
cast
it
from
him
exerting
every
ounce
of
nerve
and
sinew
it
fell
a
few
feet
in
front
of
him
conan
swore
man
living
could
throw
that
rock
across
this
glade
it
a
task
for
siege
engines
yet
here
there
are
no
mangonels
or
ballistas
it
was
thrown
by
some
such
engine
from
afar
she
suggested
he
shook
his
head
did
fall
from
above
it
came
from
yonder
thicket
see
how
the
twigs
are
broken
it
was
thrown
as
a
man
might
throw
a
pebble
but
who
what
come
she
hesitantly
followed
him
into
the
thicket
inside
the
outer
ring
of
leafy
brush
the
undergrowth
was
less
dense
utter
silence
brooded
over
all
the
springy
sward
gave
no
sign
of
footprint
yet
from
this
mysterious
thicket
had
hurtled
that
boulder
swift
and
deadly
conan
bent
closer
to
the
sward
where
the
grass
was
crushed
down
here
and
there
he
shook
his
head
angrily
even
to
his
keen
eyes
it
gave
no
clue
as
to
what
had
stood
or
trodden
there
his
gaze
roved
to
the
green
roof
above
their
heads
a
solid
ceiling
of
thick
leaves
and
interwoven
arches
and
he
froze
suddenly
then
rising
sword
in
hand
he
began
to
back
away
thrusting
olivia
behind
him
of
here
quick
he
urged
in
a
whisper
that
congealed
the
blood
is
it
what
do
you
see
he
answered
guardedly
not
halting
his
wary
retreat
what
is
it
then
what
lurks
in
this
thicket
he
answered
his
gaze
still
fixed
on
the
brooding
jade
arches
that
shut
out
the
sky
once
out
of
the
thicket
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
swiftly
through
the
thinning
trees
until
they
mounted
a
grassy
slope
sparsely
treed
and
emerged
upon
a
low
plateau
where
the
grass
grew
taller
and
the
trees
were
few
and
scattered
and
in
the
midst
of
that
plateau
rose
a
long
broad
structure
of
crumbling
greenish
stone
they
gazed
in
wonder
no
legends
named
such
a
building
on
any
island
of
vilayet
they
approached
it
warily
seeing
that
moss
and
lichen
crawled
over
the
stones
and
the
broken
roof
gaped
to
the
sky
on
all
sides
lay
bits
and
shards
of
masonry
half
hidden
in
the
waving
grass
giving
the
impression
that
once
many
buildings
rose
there
perhaps
a
whole
town
but
now
only
the
long
structure
rose
against
the
sky
and
its
walls
leaned
drunkenly
among
the
crawling
vines
whatever
doors
had
once
guarded
its
portals
had
long
rotted
away
conan
and
his
companion
stood
in
the
broad
entrance
and
stared
inside
sunlight
streamed
in
through
gaps
in
the
walls
and
roof
making
the
interior
a
dim
weave
of
light
and
shadow
grasping
his
sword
firmly
conan
entered
with
the
slouching
gait
of
a
hunting
panther
sunken
head
and
noiseless
feet
olivia
tiptoed
after
him
once
within
conan
grunted
in
surprize
and
olivia
stifled
a
scream
oh
look
see
he
answered
to
fear
they
are
statues
how
and
how
evil
she
whispered
drawing
close
to
him
they
stood
in
a
great
hall
whose
floor
was
of
polished
stone
littered
with
dust
and
broken
stones
which
had
fallen
from
the
ceiling
vines
growing
between
the
stones
masked
the
apertures
the
lofty
roof
flat
and
undomed
was
upheld
by
thick
columns
marching
in
rows
down
the
sides
of
the
walls
and
in
each
space
between
these
columns
stood
a
strange
figure
they
were
statues
apparently
of
iron
black
and
shining
as
if
continually
polished
they
were
depicting
tall
lithely
powerful
men
with
cruel
faces
they
were
naked
and
every
swell
depression
and
contour
of
joint
and
sinew
was
represented
with
incredible
realism
but
the
most
feature
was
their
proud
intolerant
faces
these
features
were
not
cast
in
the
same
mold
each
face
possessed
its
own
individual
characteristics
though
there
was
a
tribal
likeness
between
them
all
there
was
none
of
the
monotonous
uniformity
of
decorative
art
in
the
faces
at
least
seem
to
be
listening
and
waiting
whispered
the
girl
uneasily
conan
rang
his
hilt
against
one
of
the
images
he
pronounced
crom
in
what
molds
were
they
cast
he
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
in
puzzlement
olivia
glanced
timidly
about
the
great
silent
hall
only
the
stones
the
pillars
with
the
dark
figures
brooding
between
them
met
her
gaze
she
shifted
uneasily
and
wished
to
be
gone
but
the
images
held
a
strange
fascination
for
her
companion
he
examined
them
in
detail
and
tried
to
break
off
their
limbs
but
their
material
resisted
his
best
efforts
he
could
neither
disfigure
nor
dislodge
from
its
niche
a
single
image
at
last
he
desisted
swearing
in
his
wonder
manner
of
men
were
these
copied
from
he
inquired
of
the
world
at
large
figures
are
black
yet
they
are
not
like
negroes
i
have
never
seen
their
like
us
go
into
the
sunlight
urged
olivia
and
he
nodded
with
a
baffled
glance
at
the
brooding
shapes
along
the
walls
so
they
passed
out
of
the
dusky
hall
into
the
clear
blaze
of
the
summer
sun
she
was
surprized
to
note
its
position
in
the
sky
they
had
spent
more
time
in
the
ruins
than
she
had
guessed
us
take
to
the
boat
again
she
suggested
am
afraid
here
it
is
a
strange
evil
place
we
do
not
know
when
we
may
be
attacked
by
whatever
cast
the
rock
think
we
safe
as
long
as
we
not
under
the
trees
he
answered
the
plateau
whose
sides
fell
away
toward
the
wooded
shores
on
the
east
west
and
south
sloped
upward
toward
the
north
to
abut
on
a
tangle
of
rocky
cliffs
the
highest
point
of
the
island
thither
conan
took
his
way
suiting
his
long
stride
to
his
companion
gait
from
time
to
time
his
glance
rested
inscrutably
upon
her
and
she
was
aware
of
it
they
reached
the
northern
extremity
of
the
plateau
and
stood
gazing
up
the
steep
pitch
of
the
cliffs
trees
grew
thickly
along
the
rim
of
the
plateau
east
and
west
of
the
cliffs
and
clung
to
the
precipitous
incline
conan
glanced
at
these
trees
suspiciously
but
he
began
the
ascent
helping
his
companion
on
the
climb
the
slope
was
not
sheer
and
was
broken
by
ledges
and
boulders
the
cimmerian
born
in
a
hill
country
could
have
run
up
it
like
a
cat
but
olivia
found
the
going
difficult
again
and
again
she
felt
herself
lifted
lightly
off
her
feet
and
over
some
obstacle
that
would
have
taxed
her
strength
to
surmount
and
her
wonder
grew
at
the
sheer
physical
power
of
the
man
she
no
longer
found
his
touch
repugnant
there
was
a
promise
of
protection
in
his
iron
clasp
at
last
they
stood
on
the
ultimate
pinnacle
their
hair
stirring
in
the
sea
wind
from
their
feet
the
cliffs
fell
away
sheerly
three
or
four
hundred
feet
to
a
narrow
tangle
of
woodlands
bordering
the
beach
looking
southward
they
saw
the
whole
island
lying
like
a
great
oval
mirror
its
bevelled
edges
sloping
down
swiftly
into
a
rim
of
green
except
where
it
broke
in
the
pitch
of
the
cliffs
as
far
as
they
could
see
on
all
sides
stretched
the
blue
waters
still
placid
fading
into
dreamy
hazes
of
distance
sea
is
still
sighed
olivia
should
we
not
take
up
our
journey
again
conan
poised
like
a
bronze
statue
on
the
cliffs
pointed
northward
straining
her
eyes
olivia
saw
a
white
fleck
that
seemed
to
hang
suspended
in
the
aching
haze
is
it
sail
can
tell
at
this
distance
will
anchor
here
search
the
island
for
us
she
cried
in
quick
panic
doubt
it
they
come
from
the
north
so
they
can
not
be
searching
for
us
they
may
stop
for
some
other
reason
in
which
case
we
have
to
hide
as
best
we
can
but
i
believe
it
either
pirate
or
an
hyrkanian
galley
returning
from
some
northern
raid
in
the
latter
case
they
are
not
likely
to
anchor
here
but
we
ca
put
to
sea
until
they
gone
out
of
sight
for
they
coming
from
the
direction
in
which
we
must
go
doubtless
they
pass
the
island
tonight
and
at
dawn
we
can
go
on
our
way
we
must
spend
the
night
here
she
shivered
safest
let
us
sleep
here
on
the
crags
she
urged
he
shook
his
head
glancing
at
the
stunted
trees
at
the
marching
woods
below
a
green
mass
which
seemed
to
send
out
tendrils
straggling
up
the
sides
of
the
cliffs
are
too
many
trees
we
sleep
in
the
ruins
she
cried
out
in
protest
will
harm
you
there
he
soothed
threw
the
stone
at
us
did
not
follow
us
out
of
the
woods
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
wild
thing
lairs
in
the
ruins
besides
you
are
and
used
to
shelter
and
dainties
i
could
sleep
naked
in
the
snow
and
feel
no
discomfort
but
the
dew
would
give
you
cramps
were
we
to
sleep
in
the
open
olivia
helplessly
acquiesced
and
they
descended
the
cliffs
crossed
the
plateau
and
once
more
approached
the
gloomy
ruins
by
this
time
the
sun
was
sinking
below
the
plateau
rim
they
had
found
fruit
in
the
trees
near
the
cliffs
and
these
formed
their
supper
both
food
and
drink
the
southern
night
swept
down
quickly
littering
the
dark
blue
sky
with
great
white
stars
and
conan
entered
the
shadowy
ruins
drawing
the
reluctant
olivia
after
him
she
shivered
at
the
sight
of
those
tense
black
shadows
in
their
niches
along
the
walls
in
the
darkness
that
the
starlight
only
faintly
touched
she
could
not
make
out
their
outlines
she
could
only
sense
their
attitude
of
waiting
waiting
as
they
had
waited
for
untold
centuries
conan
had
brought
a
great
armful
of
tender
branches
well
leafed
these
he
heaped
to
make
a
couch
for
her
and
she
lay
upon
it
with
a
curious
sensation
as
of
one
lying
down
to
sleep
in
a
serpent
lair
whatever
her
forebodings
conan
did
not
share
them
the
cimmerian
sat
down
near
her
his
back
against
a
pillar
his
sword
across
his
knees
his
eyes
gleamed
like
a
panther
in
the
dusk
girl
said
he
slumber
is
light
as
a
wolf
nothing
can
enter
this
hall
without
awaking
me
olivia
did
not
reply
from
her
bed
of
leaves
she
watched
the
immobile
figure
indistinct
in
the
soft
darkness
how
strange
to
move
in
fellowship
with
a
barbarian
to
be
cared
for
and
protected
by
one
of
a
race
tales
of
which
had
frightened
her
as
a
child
he
came
of
a
people
bloody
grim
and
ferocious
his
kinship
to
the
wild
was
apparent
in
his
every
action
it
burned
in
his
smoldering
eyes
yet
he
had
not
harmed
her
and
her
worst
oppressor
had
been
a
man
the
world
called
civilized
as
a
delicious
languor
stole
over
her
relaxing
limbs
and
she
sank
into
foamy
billows
of
slumber
her
last
waking
thought
was
a
drowsy
recollection
of
the
firm
touch
of
conan
fingers
on
her
soft
flesh
olivia
dreamed
and
through
her
dreams
crawled
a
suggestion
of
lurking
evil
like
a
black
serpent
writhing
through
flower
gardens
her
dreams
were
fragmentary
and
colorful
exotic
shards
of
a
broken
unknown
pattern
until
they
crystalized
into
a
scene
of
horror
and
madness
etched
against
a
background
of
cyclopean
stones
and
pillars
she
saw
a
great
hall
whose
lofty
ceiling
was
upheld
by
stone
columns
marching
in
even
rows
along
the
massive
walls
among
these
pillars
fluttered
great
green
and
scarlet
parrots
and
the
hall
was
thronged
with
warriors
they
were
not
negroes
neither
they
nor
their
garments
nor
weapons
resembled
anything
of
the
world
the
dreamer
knew
they
were
pressing
about
one
bound
to
a
pillar
a
slender
youth
with
a
cluster
of
golden
curls
about
his
alabaster
brow
his
beauty
was
not
altogether
human
like
the
dream
of
a
god
chiseled
out
of
living
marble
the
black
warriors
laughed
at
him
jeered
and
taunted
in
a
strange
tongue
the
lithe
naked
form
writhed
beneath
their
cruel
hands
blood
trickled
down
the
ivory
thighs
to
spatter
on
the
polished
floor
the
screams
of
the
victim
echoed
through
the
hall
then
lifting
his
head
toward
the
ceiling
and
the
skies
beyond
he
cried
out
a
name
in
an
awful
voice
a
dagger
in
an
ebon
hand
cut
short
his
cry
and
the
golden
head
rolled
on
the
ivory
breast
as
if
in
answer
to
that
desperate
cry
there
was
a
rolling
thunder
as
of
celestial
and
a
figure
stood
before
the
slayers
as
if
materialized
out
of
empty
air
the
form
was
of
a
man
but
no
mortal
man
ever
wore
such
an
aspect
of
inhuman
beauty
there
was
an
unmistakable
resemblance
between
him
and
the
youth
who
dropped
lifeless
in
his
chains
but
the
alloy
of
humanity
that
softened
the
godliness
of
the
youth
was
lacking
in
the
features
of
the
stranger
awful
and
immobile
in
their
beauty
the
blacks
shrank
back
before
him
their
eyes
slits
of
fire
lifting
a
hand
he
spoke
and
his
tones
echoed
through
the
silent
halls
in
deep
rich
waves
of
sound
like
men
in
a
trance
the
black
warriors
fell
back
until
they
were
ranged
along
the
walls
in
regular
lines
then
from
the
stranger
chiseled
lips
rang
a
terrible
invocation
and
command
yok
tha
xuthalla
at
the
blast
of
that
awful
cry
the
black
figures
stiffened
and
froze
over
their
limbs
crept
a
curious
rigidity
an
unnatural
petrification
the
stranger
touched
the
limp
body
of
the
youth
and
the
chains
fell
away
from
it
he
lifted
the
corpse
in
his
arms
then
ere
he
turned
away
his
tranquil
gaze
swept
again
over
the
silent
rows
of
ebony
figures
and
he
pointed
to
the
moon
which
gleamed
in
through
the
casements
and
they
understood
those
tense
waiting
statues
that
had
been
men
olivia
awoke
starting
up
on
her
couch
of
branches
a
cold
sweat
beading
her
skin
her
heart
pounded
loud
in
the
silence
she
glanced
wildly
about
conan
slept
against
his
pillar
his
head
fallen
upon
his
massive
breast
the
silvery
radiance
of
the
late
moon
crept
through
the
gaping
roof
throwing
long
white
lines
along
the
dusty
floor
she
could
see
the
images
dimly
black
tense
waiting
fighting
down
a
rising
hysteria
she
saw
the
moonbeams
rest
lightly
on
the
pillars
and
the
shapes
between
what
was
that
a
tremor
among
the
shadows
where
the
moonlight
fell
a
paralysis
of
horror
gripped
her
for
where
there
should
have
been
the
immobility
of
death
there
was
movement
a
slow
twitching
a
flexing
and
writhing
of
ebon
limbs
an
awful
scream
burst
from
her
lips
as
she
broke
the
bonds
that
held
her
mute
and
motionless
at
her
shriek
conan
shot
erect
teeth
gleaming
sword
lifted
statues
the
statues
my
god
the
statues
are
coming
to
life
and
with
the
cry
she
sprang
through
a
crevice
in
the
wall
burst
madly
through
the
hindering
vines
and
ran
ran
ran
blind
screaming
witless
until
a
grasp
on
her
arm
brought
her
up
short
and
she
shrieked
and
fought
against
the
arms
that
caught
her
until
a
familiar
voice
penetrated
the
mists
of
her
terror
and
she
saw
conan
face
a
mask
of
bewilderment
in
the
moonlight
in
crom
name
girl
did
you
have
a
nightmare
his
voice
sounded
strange
and
far
away
with
a
sobbing
gasp
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
thick
neck
and
clung
to
him
convulsively
crying
in
panting
catches
are
they
did
they
follow
us
followed
us
he
answered
she
sat
up
still
clinging
to
him
and
looked
fearfully
about
her
blind
flight
had
carried
her
to
the
southern
edge
of
the
plateau
just
below
them
was
the
slope
its
foot
masked
in
the
thick
shadows
of
the
woods
behind
them
she
saw
the
ruins
looming
in
the
moon
you
not
see
them
the
statues
moving
lifting
their
hands
their
eyes
glaring
in
the
shadows
saw
nothing
answered
the
barbarian
uneasily
slept
more
soundly
than
usual
because
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
have
slumbered
the
night
through
yet
i
do
think
anything
could
have
entered
the
hall
without
waking
me
entered
a
laugh
of
hysteria
escaped
her
was
something
there
already
ah
mitra
we
lay
down
to
sleep
among
them
like
sheep
making
their
bed
in
the
shambles
are
you
talking
about
he
demanded
woke
at
your
cry
but
before
i
had
time
to
look
about
me
i
saw
you
rush
out
through
the
crack
in
the
wall
i
pursued
you
lest
you
come
to
harm
i
thought
you
had
a
nightmare
i
did
she
shivered
the
reality
was
more
grisly
than
the
dream
listen
and
she
narrated
all
that
she
had
dreamed
and
thought
to
see
conan
listened
attentively
the
natural
skepticism
of
the
sophisticated
man
was
not
his
his
mythology
contained
ghouls
goblins
and
necromancers
after
she
had
finished
he
sat
silent
absently
toying
with
his
sword
youth
they
tortured
was
like
the
tall
man
who
came
he
asked
at
last
like
as
son
to
father
she
answered
and
hesitantly
the
mind
could
conceive
of
the
offspring
of
a
union
of
divinity
with
humanity
it
would
picture
that
youth
the
gods
of
old
times
mated
sometimes
with
mortal
women
our
legends
tell
us
gods
he
muttered
nameless
forgotten
ones
who
knows
they
have
gone
back
into
the
still
waters
of
the
lakes
the
quiet
hearts
of
the
hills
the
gulfs
beyond
the
stars
gods
are
no
more
stable
than
men
if
these
shapes
were
men
blasted
into
iron
images
by
some
god
or
devil
how
can
they
come
to
life
is
witchcraft
in
the
moon
she
shuddered
pointed
at
the
moon
while
the
moon
shines
on
them
they
live
so
i
believe
we
were
not
pursued
muttered
conan
glancing
toward
the
brooding
ruins
might
have
dreamed
they
moved
i
am
of
a
mind
to
return
and
see
no
she
cried
clutching
him
desperately
the
spell
upon
them
holds
them
in
the
hall
do
not
go
back
they
will
rend
you
limb
from
limb
oh
conan
let
us
go
into
our
boat
and
flee
this
awful
island
surely
the
hyrkanian
ship
has
passed
us
now
let
us
go
so
frantic
was
her
pleading
that
conan
was
impressed
his
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
images
was
balanced
by
his
superstition
foes
of
flesh
and
blood
he
did
not
fear
however
great
the
odds
but
any
hint
of
the
supernatural
roused
all
the
dim
monstrous
instincts
of
fear
that
are
the
heritage
of
the
barbarian
he
took
the
girl
hand
and
they
went
down
the
slope
and
plunged
into
the
dense
woods
where
the
leaves
whispered
and
nameless
murmured
drowsily
under
the
trees
the
shadows
clustered
thick
and
conan
swerved
to
avoid
the
denser
patches
his
eyes
roved
continuously
from
side
to
side
and
often
flitted
into
the
branches
above
them
he
went
quickly
yet
warily
his
arm
girdling
the
girl
waist
so
strongly
that
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
carried
rather
than
guided
neither
spoke
the
only
sound
was
the
girl
quick
nervous
panting
the
rustle
of
her
small
feet
in
the
grass
so
they
came
through
the
trees
to
the
edge
of
the
water
shimmering
like
molten
silver
in
the
moonlight
should
have
brought
fruit
for
food
muttered
conan
doubtless
we
find
other
islands
as
well
leave
now
as
later
it
but
a
few
hours
till
dawn
his
voice
trailed
away
the
painter
was
still
made
fast
to
the
looping
root
but
at
the
other
end
was
only
a
smashed
and
shattered
ruin
half
submerged
in
the
shallow
water
a
stifled
cry
escaped
olivia
conan
wheeled
and
faced
the
dense
shadows
a
crouching
image
of
menace
the
noise
of
the
was
suddenly
silent
a
brooding
stillness
reigned
over
the
woods
no
breeze
moved
the
branches
yet
somewhere
the
leaves
stirred
faintly
quick
as
a
great
cat
conan
caught
up
olivia
and
ran
through
the
shadows
he
raced
like
a
phantom
while
somewhere
above
and
behind
them
sounded
a
curious
rushing
among
the
leaves
that
implacably
drew
closer
and
closer
then
the
moonlight
burst
full
upon
their
faces
and
they
were
speeding
up
the
slope
of
the
plateau
at
the
crest
conan
laid
olivia
down
and
turned
to
glare
back
at
the
gulf
of
shadows
they
had
just
quitted
the
leaves
shook
in
a
sudden
breeze
that
was
all
he
shook
his
mane
with
an
angry
growl
olivia
crept
to
his
feet
like
a
frightened
child
her
eyes
looked
up
at
him
dark
wells
of
horror
are
we
to
do
conan
she
whispered
he
looked
at
the
ruins
stared
again
into
the
woods
below
go
to
the
cliffs
he
declared
lifting
her
to
her
feet
i
make
a
raft
and
we
trust
our
luck
to
the
sea
again
was
not
not
that
destroyed
our
boat
it
was
half
question
half
assertion
he
shook
his
head
grimly
taciturn
every
step
of
the
way
across
that
plateau
was
a
sweating
terror
for
olivia
but
no
black
shapes
stole
subtly
from
the
looming
ruins
and
at
last
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
crags
which
rose
stark
and
gloomily
majestic
above
them
there
conan
halted
in
some
uncertainty
at
last
selecting
a
place
sheltered
by
a
broad
ledge
nowhere
near
any
trees
down
and
sleep
if
you
can
olivia
he
said
keep
watch
but
no
sleep
came
to
olivia
and
she
lay
watching
the
distant
ruins
and
the
wooded
rim
until
the
stars
paled
the
east
whitened
and
dawn
in
rose
and
gold
struck
fire
from
the
dew
on
the
she
rose
stiffly
her
mind
reverting
to
all
the
happenings
of
the
night
in
the
morning
light
some
of
its
terrors
seemed
like
figments
of
an
overwrought
imagination
conan
strode
over
to
her
and
his
words
electrified
her
before
dawn
i
heard
the
creak
of
timbers
and
the
rasp
and
clack
of
cordage
and
oars
a
ship
has
put
in
and
anchored
at
the
beach
not
far
away
probably
the
ship
whose
sail
we
saw
yesterday
we
go
up
the
cliffs
and
spy
on
her
up
they
went
and
lying
on
their
bellies
among
the
boulders
saw
a
painted
mast
jutting
up
beyond
the
trees
to
the
west
hyrkanian
craft
from
the
cut
of
her
rigging
muttered
conan
wonder
if
the
crew
a
distant
medley
of
voices
reached
their
ears
and
creeping
to
the
southern
edge
of
the
cliffs
they
saw
a
motley
horde
emerge
from
the
fringe
of
trees
along
the
western
rim
of
the
plateau
and
stand
there
a
space
in
debate
there
was
much
flourishing
of
arms
brandishing
of
swords
and
loud
rough
argument
then
the
whole
band
started
across
the
plateau
toward
the
ruins
at
a
slant
that
would
take
them
close
by
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
whispered
conan
a
grim
smile
on
his
thin
lips
an
hyrkanian
galley
they
captured
here
crawl
among
these
rocks
show
yourself
unless
i
call
to
you
he
instructed
having
secreted
her
to
his
satisfaction
among
a
tangle
of
boulders
along
the
crest
of
the
cliffs
going
to
meet
these
dogs
if
i
succeed
in
my
plan
all
will
be
well
and
we
sail
away
with
them
if
i
succeed
well
hide
yourself
in
the
rocks
until
they
gone
for
no
devils
on
this
island
are
as
cruel
as
these
and
tearing
himself
from
her
reluctant
grasp
he
swung
quickly
down
the
cliffs
looking
fearfully
from
her
eyrie
olivia
saw
the
band
had
neared
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
even
as
she
looked
conan
stepped
out
from
among
the
boulders
and
faced
them
sword
in
hand
they
gave
back
with
yells
of
menace
and
surprize
then
halted
uncertainly
to
glare
at
this
figure
which
had
appeared
so
suddenly
from
the
rocks
there
were
some
seventy
of
them
a
wild
horde
made
up
of
men
from
many
nations
kothians
zamorians
brythunians
corinthians
shemites
their
features
reflected
the
wildness
of
their
natures
many
bore
the
scars
of
the
lash
or
the
there
were
cropped
ears
slit
noses
gaping
stumps
of
wrists
marks
of
the
hangman
as
well
as
scars
of
battle
most
of
them
were
half
naked
but
the
garments
they
wore
were
fine
jackets
satin
girdles
silken
breeches
tattered
stained
with
tar
and
blood
vied
with
pieces
of
armor
jewels
glittered
in
and
and
in
the
hilts
of
their
daggers
over
against
this
bizarre
mob
stood
the
tall
cimmerian
in
strong
contrast
with
his
hard
bronzed
limbs
and
vital
features
are
you
they
roared
the
cimmerian
his
voice
was
like
the
deep
challenge
of
a
lion
of
the
free
companions
i
mean
to
try
my
luck
with
the
red
brotherhood
who
your
chief
by
ishtar
bellowed
a
voice
as
a
huge
figure
swaggered
forward
a
giant
naked
to
the
waist
where
his
capacious
belly
was
girdled
by
a
wide
sash
that
upheld
voluminous
silken
pantaloons
his
head
was
shaven
except
for
a
his
mustaches
dropped
over
a
mouth
green
shemitish
slippers
with
upturned
toes
were
on
his
feet
a
long
straight
sword
in
his
hand
conan
stared
and
glared
of
khrosha
by
crom
by
ishtar
boomed
the
giant
his
small
black
eyes
glittering
with
hate
you
think
i
had
forgot
ha
sergius
never
forgets
an
enemy
now
i
hang
you
up
by
the
heels
and
skin
you
alive
at
him
lads
send
your
dogs
at
me
sneered
conan
with
bitter
scorn
were
always
a
coward
you
kothic
cur
to
me
the
broad
face
turned
black
with
passion
guard
you
northern
dog
i
cut
out
your
heart
in
an
instant
the
pirates
had
formed
a
circle
about
the
rivals
their
eyes
blazing
their
breath
sucking
between
their
teeth
in
bloodthirsty
enjoyment
high
up
among
the
crags
olivia
watched
sinking
her
nails
into
her
palms
in
her
painful
excitement
without
formality
the
combatants
engaged
sergius
coming
in
with
a
rush
quick
on
his
feet
as
a
giant
cat
for
all
his
bulk
curses
hissed
between
his
clenched
teeth
as
he
lustily
swung
and
parried
conan
fought
in
silence
his
eyes
slits
of
blue
the
kothian
ceased
his
oaths
to
save
his
breath
the
only
sounds
were
the
quick
scuff
of
feet
on
the
sward
the
panting
of
the
pirate
the
ring
and
clash
of
steel
the
swords
flashed
like
white
fire
in
the
early
sun
wheeling
and
circling
they
seemed
to
recoil
from
each
contact
then
leap
together
again
instantly
sergius
was
giving
back
only
his
superlative
skill
had
saved
him
thus
far
from
the
blinding
speed
of
the
cimmerian
onslaught
a
louder
clash
of
steel
a
sliding
rasp
a
choking
cry
from
the
pirate
horde
a
fierce
yell
split
the
morning
as
conan
sword
plunged
through
their
captain
massive
body
the
point
quivered
an
instant
from
between
sergius
shoulders
a
breadth
of
white
fire
in
the
sunlight
then
the
cimmerian
wrenched
back
his
steel
and
the
pirate
chief
fell
heavily
face
down
and
lay
in
a
widening
pool
of
blood
his
broad
hands
twitching
for
an
instant
conan
wheeled
toward
the
gaping
corsairs
you
dogs
he
roared
sent
your
chief
to
hell
what
says
the
law
of
the
red
brotherhood
before
any
could
answer
a
brythunian
standing
behind
his
fellows
whirled
a
sling
swiftly
and
deadly
straight
as
an
arrow
sped
the
stone
to
its
mark
and
conan
reeled
and
fell
as
a
tall
tree
falls
to
the
woodsman
ax
up
on
the
cliff
olivia
caught
at
the
boulders
for
support
the
scene
swam
dizzily
before
her
eyes
all
she
could
see
was
the
cimmerian
lying
limply
on
the
sward
blood
oozing
from
his
head
the
one
yelped
in
triumph
and
ran
to
stab
the
prostrate
man
but
a
lean
corinthian
thrust
him
back
aratus
would
you
break
the
law
of
the
brotherhood
you
dog
law
is
broken
snarled
the
brythunian
law
why
you
dog
this
man
you
have
just
struck
down
is
by
just
rights
our
captain
shouted
aratus
was
not
of
our
band
but
an
outsider
he
had
not
been
admitted
to
fellowship
slaying
sergius
does
not
make
him
captain
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
one
of
us
killed
him
he
wished
to
join
us
retorted
the
corinthian
said
so
at
that
a
great
clamor
arose
some
siding
with
aratus
some
with
the
corinthian
whom
they
called
ivanos
oaths
flew
thick
challenges
were
passed
hands
fumbled
at
at
last
a
shemite
spoke
up
above
the
clamor
do
you
argue
over
a
dead
man
not
dead
answered
the
corinthian
rising
from
beside
the
prostrate
cimmerian
was
a
glancing
blow
he
only
stunned
at
that
the
clamor
rose
anew
aratus
trying
to
get
at
the
senseless
man
and
ivanos
finally
bestriding
him
sword
in
hand
and
defying
all
and
sundry
olivia
sensed
that
it
was
not
so
much
in
defense
of
conan
that
the
corinthian
took
his
stand
but
in
opposition
to
aratus
evidently
these
men
had
been
sergius
lieutenants
and
there
was
no
love
lost
between
them
after
more
arguments
it
was
decided
to
bind
conan
and
take
him
along
with
them
his
fate
to
be
voted
on
later
the
cimmerian
who
was
beginning
to
regain
consciousness
was
bound
with
leather
girdles
and
then
four
pirates
lifted
him
and
with
many
complaints
and
curses
carried
him
along
with
the
band
which
took
up
its
journey
across
the
plateau
once
more
the
body
of
sergius
was
left
where
it
had
fallen
a
sprawling
unlovely
shape
on
the
sward
up
among
the
rocks
olivia
lay
stunned
by
the
disaster
she
was
incapable
of
speech
or
action
and
could
only
lie
there
and
stare
with
horrified
eyes
as
the
brutal
horde
dragged
her
protector
away
how
long
she
lay
there
she
did
not
know
across
the
plateau
she
saw
the
pirates
reach
the
ruins
and
enter
dragging
their
captive
she
saw
them
swarming
in
and
out
of
the
doors
and
crevices
prodding
into
the
heaps
of
debris
and
clambering
about
the
walls
after
awhile
a
score
of
them
came
back
across
the
plateau
and
vanished
among
the
trees
on
the
western
rim
dragging
the
body
of
sergius
after
them
presumably
to
cast
into
the
sea
about
the
ruins
the
others
were
cutting
down
trees
and
securing
material
for
a
fire
olivia
heard
their
shouts
unintelligible
in
the
distance
and
she
heard
the
voices
of
those
who
had
gone
into
the
woods
echoing
among
the
trees
presently
they
came
back
into
sight
bearing
casks
of
liquor
and
leathern
sacks
of
food
they
headed
for
the
ruins
cursing
lustily
under
their
burdens
of
all
this
olivia
was
but
mechanically
cognizant
her
overwrought
brain
was
almost
ready
to
collapse
left
alone
and
unprotected
she
realized
how
much
the
protection
of
the
cimmerian
had
meant
to
her
there
intruded
vaguely
a
wonderment
at
the
mad
pranks
of
fate
that
could
make
the
daughter
of
a
king
the
companion
of
a
barbarian
with
it
came
a
revulsion
toward
her
own
kind
her
father
and
shah
amurath
they
were
civilized
men
and
from
them
she
had
had
only
suffering
she
had
never
encountered
any
civilized
man
who
treated
her
with
kindness
unless
there
was
an
ulterior
motive
behind
his
actions
conan
had
shielded
her
protected
her
and
so
far
demanded
nothing
in
return
laying
her
head
in
her
rounded
arms
she
wept
until
distant
shouts
of
ribald
revelry
roused
her
to
her
own
danger
she
glanced
from
the
dark
ruins
about
which
the
fantastic
figures
small
in
the
distance
weaved
and
staggered
to
the
dusky
depths
of
the
green
forest
even
if
her
terrors
in
the
ruins
the
night
before
had
been
only
dreams
the
menace
that
lurked
in
those
green
leafy
depths
below
was
no
figment
of
nightmare
were
conan
slain
or
carried
away
captive
her
only
choice
would
lie
between
giving
herself
up
to
the
human
wolves
of
the
sea
or
remaining
alone
on
that
island
as
the
full
horror
of
her
situation
swept
over
her
she
fell
forward
in
a
swoon
the
sun
was
hanging
low
when
olivia
regained
her
senses
a
faint
wind
wafted
to
her
ears
distant
shouts
and
snatches
of
ribald
song
rising
cautiously
she
looked
out
across
the
plateau
she
saw
the
pirates
clustered
about
a
great
fire
outside
the
ruins
and
her
heart
leaped
as
a
group
emerged
from
the
interior
dragging
some
object
she
knew
was
conan
they
propped
him
against
the
wall
still
evidently
bound
fast
and
there
ensued
a
long
discussion
with
much
brandishing
of
weapons
at
last
they
dragged
him
back
into
the
hall
and
took
up
anew
the
business
of
olivia
sighed
at
least
she
knew
that
the
cimmerian
still
lived
fresh
determination
steeled
her
as
soon
as
night
fell
she
would
steal
to
those
grim
ruins
and
free
him
or
be
taken
herself
in
the
attempt
and
she
knew
it
was
not
selfish
interest
alone
which
prompted
her
decision
with
this
in
mind
she
ventured
to
creep
from
her
refuge
to
pluck
and
eat
nuts
which
grew
sparsely
near
at
hand
she
had
not
eaten
since
the
day
before
it
was
while
so
occupied
that
she
was
troubled
by
a
sensation
of
being
watched
she
scanned
the
rocks
nervously
then
with
a
shuddering
suspicion
crept
to
the
north
edge
of
the
cliff
and
gazed
down
into
the
waving
green
mass
below
already
dusky
with
the
sunset
she
saw
nothing
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
be
seen
when
not
on
the
cliff
edge
by
anything
lurking
in
those
woods
yet
she
distinctly
felt
the
glare
of
hidden
eyes
and
felt
that
animate
and
sentient
was
aware
of
her
presence
and
her
stealing
back
to
her
rocky
eyrie
she
lay
watching
the
distant
ruins
until
the
dusk
of
night
masked
them
and
she
marked
their
position
by
the
flickering
flames
about
which
black
figures
leaped
and
cavorted
groggily
then
she
rose
it
was
time
to
make
her
attempt
but
first
she
stole
back
to
the
northern
edge
of
the
cliffs
and
looked
down
into
the
woods
that
bordered
the
beach
and
as
she
strained
her
eyes
in
the
dim
starlight
she
stiffened
and
an
icy
hand
touched
her
heart
far
below
her
something
moved
it
was
as
if
a
black
shadow
detached
itself
from
the
gulf
of
shadows
below
her
it
moved
slowly
up
the
sheer
face
of
the
cliff
a
vague
bulk
shapeless
in
the
panic
caught
olivia
by
the
throat
and
she
struggled
with
the
scream
that
tugged
at
her
lips
turning
she
fled
down
the
southern
slope
that
flight
down
the
shadowed
cliffs
was
a
nightmare
in
which
she
slid
and
scrambled
catching
at
jagged
rocks
with
cold
fingers
as
she
tore
her
tender
skin
and
bruised
her
soft
limbs
on
the
rugged
boulders
over
which
conan
had
so
lightly
lifted
her
she
realized
again
her
dependence
on
the
barbarian
but
this
thought
was
but
one
in
a
fluttering
maelstrom
of
dizzy
fright
the
descent
seemed
endless
but
at
last
her
feet
struck
the
grassy
levels
and
in
a
very
frenzy
of
eagerness
she
sped
away
toward
the
fire
that
burned
like
the
red
heart
of
night
behind
her
as
she
fled
she
heard
a
shower
of
stones
rattle
down
the
steep
slope
and
the
sound
lent
wings
to
her
heels
what
grisly
climber
dislodged
those
stones
she
dared
not
try
to
think
strenuous
physical
action
dissipated
her
blind
terror
somewhat
and
before
she
had
reached
the
ruin
her
mind
was
clear
her
reasoning
faculties
alert
though
her
limbs
trembled
from
her
efforts
she
dropped
to
the
sward
and
wriggled
along
on
her
belly
until
from
behind
a
small
tree
that
had
escaped
the
axes
of
the
pirates
she
watched
her
enemies
they
had
completed
their
supper
but
were
still
drinking
dipping
pewter
mugs
or
jewelled
goblets
into
the
broken
heads
of
the
some
were
already
snoring
drunkenly
on
the
grass
while
others
had
staggered
into
the
ruins
of
conan
she
saw
nothing
she
lay
there
while
the
dew
formed
on
the
grass
about
her
and
the
leaves
overhead
and
the
men
about
the
fire
cursed
gambled
and
argued
there
were
only
a
few
about
the
fire
most
of
them
had
gone
into
the
ruins
to
sleep
she
lay
watching
them
her
nerves
taut
with
the
strain
of
waiting
the
flesh
crawling
between
her
shoulders
at
the
thought
of
what
might
be
watching
her
in
turn
of
what
might
be
stealing
up
behind
her
time
dragged
on
leaden
feet
one
by
one
the
revellers
sank
down
in
drunken
slumber
until
all
were
stretched
senseless
beside
the
dying
fire
olivia
hesitated
then
was
galvanized
by
a
distant
glow
rising
through
the
trees
the
moon
was
rising
with
a
gasp
she
rose
and
hurried
toward
the
ruins
her
flesh
crawled
as
she
tiptoed
among
the
drunken
shapes
that
sprawled
beside
the
gaping
portal
inside
were
many
more
they
shifted
and
mumbled
in
their
besotted
dreams
but
none
awakened
as
she
glided
among
them
a
sob
of
joy
rose
to
her
lips
as
she
saw
conan
the
cimmerian
was
wide
awake
bound
upright
to
a
pillar
his
eyes
gleaming
in
the
faint
reflection
of
the
waning
fire
outside
picking
her
way
among
the
sleepers
she
approached
him
lightly
as
she
had
come
he
had
heard
her
had
seen
her
when
first
framed
in
the
portal
a
faint
grin
touched
his
hard
lips
she
reached
him
and
clung
to
him
an
instant
he
felt
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
against
his
breast
through
a
broad
crevice
in
the
wall
stole
a
beam
of
moonlight
and
the
air
was
instantly
supercharged
with
subtle
tension
conan
felt
it
and
stiffened
olivia
felt
it
and
gasped
the
sleepers
snored
on
bending
quickly
she
drew
a
dagger
from
its
senseless
owner
belt
and
set
to
work
on
conan
bonds
they
were
sail
cords
thick
and
heavy
and
tied
with
the
craft
of
a
sailor
she
toiled
desperately
while
the
tide
of
moonlight
crept
slowly
across
the
floor
toward
the
feet
of
the
crouching
black
figures
between
the
pillars
her
breath
came
in
gasps
conan
wrists
were
free
but
his
elbows
and
legs
were
still
bound
fast
she
glanced
fleetingly
at
the
figures
along
the
walls
waiting
waiting
they
seemed
to
watch
her
with
the
awful
patience
of
the
undead
the
drunkards
beneath
her
feet
began
to
stir
and
groan
in
their
sleep
the
moonlight
crept
down
the
hall
touching
the
black
feet
the
cords
fell
from
conan
arms
and
taking
the
dagger
from
her
he
ripped
the
bonds
from
his
legs
with
a
single
quick
slash
he
stepped
out
from
the
pillar
flexing
his
limbs
stoically
enduring
the
agony
of
returning
circulation
olivia
crouched
against
him
shaking
like
a
leaf
was
it
some
trick
of
the
moonlight
that
touched
the
eyes
of
the
black
figures
with
fire
so
that
they
glimmered
redly
in
the
shadows
conan
moved
with
the
abruptness
of
a
jungle
cat
catching
up
his
sword
from
where
it
lay
in
a
stack
of
weapons
near
by
he
lifted
olivia
lightly
from
her
feet
and
glided
through
an
opening
that
gaped
in
the
wall
no
word
passed
between
them
lifting
her
in
his
arms
he
set
off
swiftly
across
the
sward
her
arms
about
his
iron
neck
the
ophirean
closed
her
eyes
cradling
her
dark
curly
head
against
his
massive
shoulder
a
delicious
sense
of
security
stole
over
her
in
spite
of
his
burden
the
cimmerian
crossed
the
plateau
swiftly
and
olivia
opening
her
eyes
saw
that
they
were
passing
under
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
climbed
the
cliffs
she
whispered
heard
it
scrambling
behind
me
as
i
came
down
have
to
chance
it
he
grunted
am
not
afraid
now
she
sighed
were
not
afraid
when
you
came
to
free
me
either
he
answered
what
a
day
it
has
been
such
haggling
and
wrangling
i
never
heard
i
nearly
deaf
aratus
wished
to
cut
out
my
heart
and
ivanos
refused
to
spite
aratus
whom
he
hates
all
day
long
they
snarled
and
spat
at
one
another
and
the
crew
quickly
grew
too
drunk
to
vote
either
way
he
halted
suddenly
an
image
of
bronze
in
the
moonlight
with
a
quick
gesture
he
tossed
the
girl
lightly
to
one
side
and
behind
him
rising
to
her
knees
on
the
soft
sward
she
screamed
at
what
she
saw
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
cliffs
moved
a
monstrous
shambling
bulk
an
anthropomorphic
horror
a
grotesque
travesty
of
creation
in
general
outline
it
was
not
unlike
a
man
but
its
face
limned
in
the
bright
moonlight
was
bestial
with
ears
flaring
nostrils
and
a
great
mouth
in
which
gleamed
white
fangs
it
was
covered
with
shaggy
grayish
hair
shot
with
silver
which
shone
in
the
moonlight
and
its
great
misshapen
paws
hung
nearly
to
the
earth
its
bulk
was
tremendous
as
it
stood
on
its
short
bowed
legs
its
rose
above
that
of
the
man
who
faced
it
the
sweep
of
the
hairy
breast
and
giant
shoulders
was
breathtaking
the
huge
arms
were
like
knotted
trees
the
moonlight
scene
swam
to
olivia
sight
this
then
was
the
end
of
the
trail
for
what
human
being
could
withstand
the
fury
of
that
hairy
mountain
of
thews
and
ferocity
yet
as
she
stared
in
horror
at
the
bronzed
figure
facing
the
monster
she
sensed
a
kinship
in
the
antagonists
that
was
almost
appalling
this
was
less
a
struggle
between
man
and
beast
than
a
conflict
between
two
creatures
of
the
wild
equally
merciless
and
ferocious
with
a
flash
of
white
tusks
the
monster
charged
the
mighty
arms
spread
wide
as
the
beast
plunged
stupefyingly
quick
for
all
his
vast
bulk
and
stunted
legs
conan
action
was
a
blur
of
speed
olivia
eye
could
not
follow
she
only
saw
that
he
evaded
that
deadly
grasp
and
his
sword
flashing
like
a
jet
of
white
lightning
sheared
through
one
of
those
massive
arms
between
shoulder
and
elbow
a
great
spout
of
blood
deluged
the
sward
as
the
severed
member
fell
twitching
horribly
but
even
as
the
sword
bit
through
the
other
malformed
hand
locked
in
conan
black
mane
only
the
iron
of
the
cimmerian
saved
him
from
a
broken
neck
that
instant
his
left
hand
darted
out
to
clamp
on
the
beast
squat
throat
his
left
knee
was
jammed
hard
against
the
brute
hairy
belly
then
began
a
terrific
struggle
which
lasted
only
seconds
but
which
seemed
like
ages
to
the
paralyzed
girl
the
ape
maintained
his
grasp
in
conan
hair
dragging
him
toward
the
tusks
that
glistened
in
the
moonlight
the
cimmerian
resisted
this
effort
with
his
left
arm
rigid
as
iron
while
the
sword
in
his
right
hand
wielded
like
a
sank
again
and
again
into
the
groin
breast
and
belly
of
his
captor
the
beast
took
its
punishment
in
awful
silence
apparently
unweakened
by
the
blood
that
gushed
from
its
ghastly
wounds
swiftly
the
terrible
strength
of
the
anthropoid
overcame
the
leverage
of
braced
arm
and
knee
inexorably
conan
arm
bent
under
the
strain
nearer
and
nearer
he
was
drawn
to
the
slavering
jaws
that
gaped
for
his
life
now
the
blazing
eyes
of
the
barbarian
glared
into
the
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
ape
but
as
conan
tugged
vainly
at
his
sword
wedged
deep
in
the
hairy
body
the
frothing
jaws
snapped
spasmodically
shut
an
inch
from
the
cimmerian
face
and
he
was
hurled
to
the
sward
by
the
dying
convulsions
of
the
monster
olivia
half
fainting
saw
the
ape
heaving
thrashing
and
writhing
gripping
the
hilt
that
jutted
from
its
body
a
sickening
instant
of
this
then
the
great
bulk
quivered
and
lay
still
conan
rose
and
limped
over
to
the
corpse
the
cimmerian
breathed
heavily
and
walked
like
a
man
whose
joints
and
muscles
have
been
wrenched
and
twisted
almost
to
their
limit
of
endurance
he
felt
his
bloody
scalp
and
swore
at
the
sight
of
the
long
black
strands
still
grasped
in
the
monster
shaggy
hand
he
panted
feel
as
if
i
been
racked
i
rather
fight
a
dozen
men
another
instant
and
he
have
bitten
off
my
head
blast
him
he
torn
a
handful
of
my
hair
out
by
the
roots
gripping
his
hilt
with
both
hands
he
tugged
and
worked
it
free
olivia
stole
close
to
clasp
his
arm
and
stare
down
at
the
sprawling
monster
what
is
it
she
whispered
gray
he
grunted
and
they
dwell
in
the
hills
that
border
the
eastern
shore
of
this
sea
how
this
one
got
to
this
island
i
ca
say
maybe
he
floated
here
on
driftwood
blown
out
from
the
mainland
in
a
storm
it
was
he
that
threw
the
stone
i
suspected
what
it
was
when
we
stood
in
the
thicket
and
i
saw
the
boughs
bending
over
our
heads
these
creatures
always
lurk
in
the
deepest
woods
they
can
find
and
seldom
emerge
what
brought
him
into
the
open
i
ca
say
but
it
was
lucky
for
us
i
have
had
no
chance
with
him
among
the
trees
followed
me
she
shivered
saw
it
climbing
the
cliffs
following
his
instinct
he
lurked
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
instead
of
following
you
out
across
the
plateau
his
kind
are
creatures
of
darkness
and
the
silent
places
haters
of
sun
and
moon
you
suppose
there
are
others
else
the
pirates
had
been
attacked
when
they
went
through
the
woods
the
gray
ape
is
wary
for
all
his
strength
as
shown
by
his
hesitancy
in
falling
upon
us
in
the
thicket
his
lust
for
you
must
have
been
great
to
have
driven
him
to
attack
us
finally
in
the
open
what
he
started
and
wheeled
back
toward
the
way
they
had
come
the
night
had
been
split
by
an
awful
scream
it
came
from
the
ruins
instantly
there
followed
a
mad
medley
of
yells
shrieks
and
cries
of
blasphemous
agony
though
accompanied
by
a
ringing
of
steel
the
sounds
were
of
massacre
rather
than
battle
conan
stood
frozen
the
girl
clinging
to
him
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
the
clamor
rose
to
a
crescendo
of
madness
and
then
the
cimmerian
turned
and
went
swiftly
toward
the
rim
of
the
plateau
with
its
fringe
of
trees
olivia
legs
were
trembling
so
that
she
could
not
walk
so
he
carried
her
and
her
heart
calmed
its
frantic
pounding
as
she
nestled
into
his
cradling
arms
they
passed
under
the
shadowy
forest
but
the
clusters
of
blackness
held
no
terrors
the
rifts
of
silver
discovered
no
grisly
shape
murmured
slumberously
the
yells
of
slaughter
dwindled
behind
them
masked
in
the
distance
to
a
confused
jumble
of
sound
somewhere
a
parrot
called
like
an
eery
echo
yok
tha
xuthalla
so
they
came
to
the
water
edge
and
saw
the
galley
lying
at
anchor
her
sail
shining
white
in
the
moonlight
already
the
stars
were
paling
for
dawn
in
the
ghastly
whiteness
of
dawn
a
handful
of
tattered
figures
staggered
through
the
trees
and
out
on
to
the
narrow
beach
there
were
of
them
and
they
were
a
cowed
and
demoralized
band
with
panting
haste
they
plunged
into
the
water
and
began
to
wade
toward
the
galley
when
a
stern
challenge
brought
them
up
standing
etched
against
the
whitening
sky
they
saw
conan
the
cimmerian
standing
in
the
bows
sword
in
hand
his
black
mane
tossing
in
the
dawn
wind
he
ordered
no
nearer
what
would
you
have
dogs
us
come
aboard
croaked
a
hairy
rogue
fingering
a
bloody
stump
of
ear
be
gone
from
this
devil
island
first
man
who
tries
to
climb
over
the
side
i
split
his
skull
promised
conan
they
were
to
one
but
he
held
the
the
fight
had
been
hammered
out
of
them
us
come
aboard
good
conan
whined
a
zamorian
glancing
fearfully
over
his
shoulder
at
the
silent
woods
have
been
so
mauled
bitten
scratched
and
rended
and
are
so
weary
from
fighting
and
running
that
not
one
of
us
can
lift
a
sword
is
that
dog
aratus
demanded
conan
with
the
others
it
was
devils
fell
upon
us
they
were
rending
us
to
pieces
before
we
could
awake
a
dozen
good
rovers
died
in
their
sleep
the
ruins
were
full
of
shadows
with
tearing
fangs
and
sharp
talons
put
in
another
corsair
were
the
demons
of
the
isle
which
took
the
forms
of
molten
images
to
befool
us
ishtar
we
lay
down
to
sleep
among
them
we
are
no
cowards
we
fought
them
as
long
as
mortal
man
may
strive
against
the
powers
of
darkness
then
we
broke
away
and
left
them
tearing
at
the
corpses
like
jackals
but
surely
they
pursue
us
let
us
come
aboard
clamored
a
lean
shemite
us
come
in
peace
or
we
must
come
sword
in
hand
and
though
we
be
so
weary
you
will
doubtless
slay
many
of
us
yet
you
can
not
prevail
against
us
many
i
knock
a
hole
in
the
planks
and
sink
her
answered
conan
grimly
a
frantic
chorus
of
expostulation
rose
which
conan
silenced
with
a
roar
must
i
aid
my
enemies
shall
i
let
you
come
aboard
and
cut
out
my
heart
nay
they
cried
eagerly
friends
conan
we
are
thy
comrades
we
be
all
lusty
rogues
together
we
hate
the
king
of
turan
not
each
other
their
gaze
hung
on
his
brown
frowning
face
if
i
am
one
of
the
brotherhood
he
grunted
laws
of
the
trade
apply
to
me
and
since
i
killed
your
chief
in
fair
fight
then
i
am
your
captain
there
was
no
dissent
the
pirates
were
too
cowed
and
battered
to
have
any
thought
except
a
desire
to
get
away
from
that
island
of
fear
conan
gaze
sought
out
the
figure
of
the
corinthian
ivanos
he
challenged
took
my
part
once
will
you
uphold
my
claims
again
by
mitra
the
pirate
sensing
the
trend
of
feeling
was
eager
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
cimmerian
is
right
lads
he
is
our
lawful
captain
a
medley
of
acquiescence
rose
lacking
enthusiasm
perhaps
but
with
sincerity
accentuated
by
the
feel
of
the
silent
woods
behind
them
which
might
mask
creeping
ebony
devils
with
red
eyes
and
dripping
talons
by
the
hilt
conan
demanded

lifted
toward
him
and
voices
blended
in
the
corsair
oath
of
allegiance
conan
grinned
and
sheathed
his
sword
aboard
my
bold
swashbucklers
and
take
the
oars
he
turned
and
lifted
olivia
to
her
feet
from
where
she
had
crouched
shielded
by
the
gunwales
what

throwing
her
white

about

bronzed
neck
