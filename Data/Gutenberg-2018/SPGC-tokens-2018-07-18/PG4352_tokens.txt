preface
this
work
by
professor
bergson
has
been
revised
in
detail
by
the
author
himself
and
the
present
translation
is
the
only
authorised
one
for
this
ungrudging
labour
of
revision
for
the
thoroughness
with
which
it
has
been
carried
out
and
for
personal
sympathy
in
many
a
difficulty
of
word
and
phrase
we
desire
to
offer
our
grateful
acknowledgment
to
professor
bergson
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
the
essay
on
laughter
originally
appeared
in
a
series
of
three
articles
in
one
of
the
leading
magazines
in
france
the
revue
de
paris
this
will
account
for
the
relatively
simple
form
of
the
work
and
the
comparative
absence
of
technical
terms
it
will
also
explain
why
the
author
has
confined
himself
to
exposing
and
illustrating
his
novel
theory
of
the
comic
without
entering
into
a
detailed
discussion
of
other
explanations
already
in
the
field
he
none
the
less
indicates
when
discussing
sundry
examples
why
the
principal
theories
to
which
they
have
given
rise
appear
to
him
inadequate
to
quote
only
a
few
one
may
mention
those
based
on
contrast
exaggeration
and
degradation
the
book
has
been
highly
successful
in
france
where
it
is
in
its
seventh
edition
it
has
been
translated
into
russian
polish
and
swedish
german
and
hungarian
translations
are
under
preparation
its
success
is
due
partly
to
the
novelty
of
the
explanation
offered
of
the
comic
and
partly
also
to
the
fact
that
the
author
incidentally
discusses
questions
of
still
greater
interest
and
importance
thus
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
frequently
quoted
passages
of
the
book
is
that
portion
of
the
last
chapter
in
which
the
author
outlines
a
general
theory
of
art
contents

what
does
laughter
mean
what
is
the
basal
element
in
the
laughable
what
common
ground
can
we
find
between
the
grimace
of
a
a
play
upon
words
an
equivocal
situation
in
a
burlesque
and
a
scene
of
high
comedy
what
method
of
distillation
will
yield
us
invariably
the
same
essence
from
which
so
many
different
products
borrow
either
their
obtrusive
odour
or
their
delicate
perfume
the
greatest
of
thinkers
from
aristotle
downwards
have
tackled
this
little
problem
which
has
a
knack
of
baffling
every
effort
of
slipping
away
and
escaping
only
to
bob
up
again
a
pert
challenge
flung
at
philosophic
speculation
our
excuse
for
attacking
the
problem
in
our
turn
must
lie
in
the
fact
that
we
shall
not
aim
at
imprisoning
the
comic
spirit
within
a
definition
we
regard
it
above
all
as
a
living
thing
however
trivial
it
may
be
we
shall
treat
it
with
the
respect
due
to
life
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
watching
it
grow
and
expand
passing
by
imperceptible
gradations
from
one
form
to
another
it
will
be
seen
to
achieve
the
strangest
metamorphoses
we
shall
disdain
nothing
we
have
seen
maybe
we
may
gain
from
this
prolonged
contact
for
the
matter
of
that
something
more
flexible
than
an
abstract
definition
a
practical
intimate
acquaintance
such
as
springs
from
a
long
companionship
and
maybe
we
may
also
find
that
unintentionally
we
have
made
an
acquaintance
that
is
useful
for
the
comic
spirit
has
a
logic
of
its
own
even
in
its
wildest
eccentricities
it
has
a
method
in
its
madness
it
dreams
i
admit
but
it
conjures
up
in
its
dreams
visions
that
are
at
once
accepted
and
understood
by
the
whole
of
a
social
group
can
it
then
fail
to
throw
light
for
us
on
the
way
that
human
imagination
works
and
more
particularly
social
collective
and
popular
imagination
begotten
of
real
life
and
akin
to
art
should
it
not
also
have
something
of
its
own
to
tell
us
about
art
and
life
at
the
outset
we
shall
put
forward
three
observations
which
we
look
upon
as
fundamental
they
have
less
bearing
on
the
actually
comic
than
on
the
field
within
which
it
must
be
sought
i
the
first
point
to
which
attention
should
be
called
is
that
the
comic
does
not
exist
outside
the
pale
of
what
is
strictly
human
a
landscape
may
be
beautiful
charming
and
sublime
or
insignificant
and
ugly
it
will
never
be
laughable
you
may
laugh
at
an
animal
but
only
because
you
have
detected
in
it
some
human
attitude
or
expression
you
may
laugh
at
a
hat
but
what
you
are
making
fun
of
in
this
case
is
not
the
piece
of
felt
or
straw
but
the
shape
that
men
have
given
it
the
human
caprice
whose
mould
it
has
assumed
it
is
strange
that
so
important
a
fact
and
such
a
simple
one
too
has
not
attracted
to
a
greater
degree
the
attention
of
philosophers
several
have
defined
man
as
an
animal
which
laughs
they
might
equally
well
have
defined
him
as
an
animal
which
is
laughed
at
for
if
any
other
animal
or
some
lifeless
object
produces
the
same
effect
it
is
always
because
of
some
resemblance
to
man
of
the
stamp
he
gives
it
or
the
use
he
puts
it
to
here
i
would
point
out
as
a
symptom
equally
worthy
of
notice
the
absence
of
feeling
which
usually
accompanies
laughter
it
seems
as
though
the
comic
could
not
produce
its
disturbing
effect
unless
it
fell
so
to
say
on
the
surface
of
a
soul
that
is
thoroughly
calm
and
unruffled
indifference
is
its
natural
environment
for
laughter
has
no
greater
foe
than
emotion
i
do
not
mean
that
we
could
not
laugh
at
a
person
who
inspires
us
with
pity
for
instance
or
even
with
affection
but
in
such
a
case
we
must
for
the
moment
put
our
affection
out
of
court
and
impose
silence
upon
our
pity
in
a
society
composed
of
pure
intelligences
there
would
probably
be
no
more
tears
though
perhaps
there
would
still
be
laughter
whereas
highly
emotional
souls
in
tune
and
unison
with
life
in
whom
every
event
would
be
sentimentally
prolonged
and
would
neither
know
nor
understand
laughter
try
for
a
moment
to
become
interested
in
everything
that
is
being
said
and
done
act
in
imagination
with
those
who
act
and
feel
with
those
who
feel
in
a
word
give
your
sympathy
its
widest
expansion
as
though
at
the
touch
of
a
fairy
wand
you
will
see
the
flimsiest
of
objects
assume
importance
and
a
gloomy
hue
spread
over
everything
now
step
aside
look
upon
life
as
a
disinterested
spectator
many
a
drama
will
turn
into
a
comedy
it
is
enough
for
us
to
stop
our
ears
to
the
sound
of
music
in
a
room
where
dancing
is
going
on
for
the
dancers
at
once
to
appear
ridiculous
how
many
human
actions
would
stand
a
similar
test
should
we
not
see
many
of
them
suddenly
pass
from
grave
to
gay
on
isolating
them
from
the
accompanying
music
of
sentiment
to
produce
the
whole
of
its
effect
then
the
comic
demands
something
like
a
momentary
anesthesia
of
the
heart
its
appeal
is
to
intelligence
pure
and
simple
this
intelligence
however
must
always
remain
in
touch
with
other
intelligences
and
here
is
the
third
fact
to
which
attention
should
be
drawn
you
would
hardly
appreciate
the
comic
if
you
felt
yourself
isolated
from
others
laughter
appears
to
stand
in
need
of
an
echo
listen
to
it
carefully
it
is
not
an
articulate
clear
sound
it
is
something
which
would
fain
be
prolonged
by
reverberating
from
one
to
another
something
beginning
with
a
crash
to
continue
in
successive
rumblings
like
thunder
in
a
mountain
still
this
reverberation
can
not
go
on
for
ever
it
can
travel
within
as
wide
a
circle
as
you
please
the
circle
remains
none
the
less
a
closed
one
our
laughter
is
always
the
laughter
of
a
group
it
may
perchance
have
happened
to
you
when
seated
in
a
railway
carriage
or
at
table
to
hear
travellers
relating
to
one
another
stories
which
must
have
been
comic
to
them
for
they
laughed
heartily
had
you
been
one
of
their
company
you
would
have
laughed
like
them
but
as
you
were
not
you
had
no
desire
whatever
to
do
so
a
man
who
was
once
asked
why
he
did
not
weep
at
a
sermon
when
everybody
else
was
shedding
tears
replied
i
do
belong
to
the
parish
what
that
man
thought
of
tears
would
be
still
more
true
of
laughter
however
spontaneous
it
seems
laughter
always
implies
a
kind
of
secret
freemasonry
or
even
complicity
with
other
laughers
real
or
imaginary
how
often
has
it
been
said
that
the
fuller
the
theatre
the
more
uncontrolled
the
laughter
of
the
audience
on
the
other
hand
how
often
has
the
remark
been
made
that
many
comic
effects
are
incapable
of
translation
from
one
language
to
another
because
they
refer
to
the
customs
and
ideas
of
a
particular
social
group
it
is
through
not
understanding
the
importance
of
this
double
fact
that
the
comic
has
been
looked
upon
as
a
mere
curiosity
in
which
the
mind
finds
amusement
and
laughter
itself
as
a
strange
isolated
phenomenon
without
any
bearing
on
the
rest
of
human
activity
hence
those
definitions
which
tend
to
make
the
comic
into
an
abstract
relation
between
ideas
an
intellectual
contrast
a
palpable
absurdity
definitions
which
even
were
they
really
suitable
to
every
form
of
the
comic
would
not
in
the
least
explain
why
the
comic
makes
us
laugh
how
indeed
should
it
come
about
that
this
particular
logical
relation
as
soon
as
it
is
perceived
contracts
expands
and
shakes
our
limbs
whilst
all
other
relations
leave
the
body
unaffected
it
is
not
from
this
point
of
view
that
we
shall
approach
the
problem
to
understand
laughter
we
must
put
it
back
into
its
natural
environment
which
is
society
and
above
all
must
we
determine
the
utility
of
its
function
which
is
a
social
one
such
let
us
say
at
once
will
be
the
leading
idea
of
all
our
investigations
laughter
must
answer
to
certain
requirements
of
life
in
common
it
must
have
a
social
signification
let
us
clearly
mark
the
point
towards
which
our
three
preliminary
observations
are
converging
the
comic
will
come
into
being
it
appears
whenever
a
group
of
men
concentrate
their
attention
on
one
of
their
number
imposing
silence
on
their
emotions
and
calling
into
play
nothing
but
their
intelligence
what
now
is
the
particular
point
on
which
their
attention
will
have
to
be
concentrated
and
what
will
here
be
the
function
of
intelligence
to
reply
to
these
questions
will
be
at
once
to
come
to
closer
grips
with
the
problem
but
here
a
few
examples
have
become
indispensable
ii
a
man
running
along
the
street
stumbles
and
falls
the
burst
out
laughing
they
would
not
laugh
at
him
i
imagine
could
they
suppose
that
the
whim
had
suddenly
seized
him
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
they
laugh
because
his
sitting
down
is
involuntary
consequently
it
is
not
his
sudden
change
of
attitude
that
raises
a
laugh
but
rather
the
involuntary
element
in
this
change
his
clumsiness
in
fact
perhaps
there
was
a
stone
on
the
road
he
should
have
altered
his
pace
or
avoided
the
obstacle
instead
of
that
through
lack
of
elasticity
through
absentmindedness
and
a
kind
of
physical
obstinacy
as
a
result
in
fact
of
rigidity
or
of
momentum
the
muscles
continued
to
perform
the
same
movement
when
the
circumstances
of
the
case
called
for
something
else
that
is
the
reason
of
the
fall
and
also
of
the
people
laughter
now
take
the
case
of
a
person
who
attends
to
the
petty
occupations
of
his
everyday
life
with
mathematical
precision
the
objects
around
him
however
have
all
been
tampered
with
by
a
mischievous
wag
the
result
being
that
when
he
dips
his
pen
into
the
inkstand
he
draws
it
out
all
covered
with
mud
when
he
fancies
he
is
sitting
down
on
a
solid
chair
he
finds
himself
sprawling
on
the
floor
in
a
word
his
actions
are
all
or
mere
beating
the
air
while
in
every
case
the
effect
is
invariably
one
of
momentum
habit
has
given
the
impulse
what
was
wanted
was
to
check
the
movement
or
deflect
it
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
but
continued
like
a
machine
in
the
same
straight
line
the
victim
then
of
a
practical
joke
is
in
a
position
similar
to
that
of
a
runner
who
falls
he
is
comic
for
the
same
reason
the
laughable
element
in
both
cases
consists
of
a
certain
mechanical
inelasticity
just
where
one
would
expect
to
find
the
adaptability
and
the
living
pliableness
of
a
human
being
the
only
difference
in
the
two
cases
is
that
the
former
happened
of
itself
whilst
the
latter
was
obtained
artificially
in
the
first
instance
the
does
nothing
but
look
on
but
in
the
second
the
mischievous
wag
intervenes
all
the
same
in
both
cases
the
result
has
been
brought
about
by
an
external
circumstance
the
comic
is
therefore
accidental
it
remains
so
to
speak
in
superficial
contact
with
the
person
how
is
it
to
penetrate
within
the
necessary
conditions
will
be
fulfilled
when
mechanical
rigidity
no
longer
requires
for
its
manifestation
a
which
either
the
hazard
of
circumstance
or
human
knavery
has
set
in
its
way
but
extracts
by
natural
processes
from
its
own
store
an
inexhaustible
series
of
opportunities
for
externally
revealing
its
presence
suppose
then
we
imagine
a
mind
always
thinking
of
what
it
has
just
done
and
never
of
what
it
is
doing
like
a
song
which
lags
behind
its
accompaniment
let
us
try
to
picture
to
ourselves
a
certain
inborn
lack
of
elasticity
of
both
senses
and
intelligence
which
brings
it
to
pass
that
we
continue
to
see
what
is
no
longer
visible
to
hear
what
is
no
longer
audible
to
say
what
is
no
longer
to
the
point
in
short
to
adapt
ourselves
to
a
past
and
therefore
imaginary
situation
when
we
ought
to
be
shaping
our
conduct
in
accordance
with
the
reality
which
is
present
this
time
the
comic
will
take
up
its
abode
in
the
person
himself
it
is
the
person
who
will
supply
it
with
everything
matter
and
form
cause
and
opportunity
is
it
then
surprising
that
the
individual
for
this
is
the
character
we
have
just
been
describing
has
usually
fired
the
imagination
of
comic
authors
when
la
bruyere
came
across
this
particular
type
he
realised
on
analysing
it
that
he
had
got
hold
of
a
recipe
for
the
wholesale
manufacture
of
comic
effects
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
overdid
it
and
gave
us
far
too
lengthy
and
detailed
a
description
of
menalque
coming
back
to
his
subject
dwelling
and
expatiating
on
it
beyond
all
bounds
the
very
facility
of
the
subject
fascinated
him
absentmindedness
indeed
is
not
perhaps
the
actual
of
the
comic
but
surely
it
is
contiguous
to
a
certain
stream
of
facts
and
fancies
which
flows
straight
from
the
it
is
situated
so
to
say
on
one
of
the
great
natural
watersheds
of
laughter
now
the
effect
of
absentmindedness
may
gather
strength
in
its
turn
there
is
a
general
law
the
first
example
of
which
we
have
just
encountered
and
which
we
will
formulate
in
the
following
terms
when
a
certain
comic
effect
has
its
origin
in
a
certain
cause
the
more
natural
we
regard
the
cause
to
be
the
more
comic
shall
we
find
the
effect
even
now
we
laugh
at
absentmindedness
when
presented
to
us
as
a
simple
fact
still
more
laughable
will
be
the
absentmindedness
we
have
seen
springing
up
and
growing
before
our
very
eyes
with
whose
origin
we
are
acquainted
and
whose
we
can
reconstruct
to
choose
a
definite
example
suppose
a
man
has
taken
to
reading
nothing
but
romances
of
love
and
chivalry
attracted
and
fascinated
by
his
heroes
his
thoughts
and
intentions
gradually
turn
more
and
more
towards
them
till
one
fine
day
we
find
him
walking
among
us
like
a
somnambulist
his
actions
are
distractions
but
then
his
distractions
can
be
traced
back
to
a
definite
positive
cause
they
are
no
longer
cases
of
absence
of
mind
pure
and
simple
they
find
their
explanation
in
the
presence
of
the
individual
in
quite
definite
though
imaginary
surroundings
doubtless
a
fall
is
always
a
fall
but
it
is
one
thing
to
tumble
into
a
well
because
you
were
looking
anywhere
but
in
front
of
you
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
fall
into
it
because
you
were
intent
upon
a
star
it
was
certainly
a
star
at
which
don
quixote
was
gazing
how
profound
is
the
comic
element
in
the
utopian
bent
of
mind
and
yet
if
you
reintroduce
the
idea
of
absentmindedness
which
acts
as
a
you
will
see
this
profound
comic
element
uniting
with
the
most
superficial
type
yes
indeed
these
whimsical
wild
enthusiasts
these
madmen
who
are
yet
so
strangely
reasonable
excite
us
to
laughter
by
playing
on
the
same
chords
within
ourselves
by
setting
in
motion
the
same
inner
mechanism
as
does
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
or
the
who
slips
down
in
the
street
they
too
are
runners
who
fall
and
simple
souls
who
are
being
hoaxed
runners
after
the
ideal
who
stumble
over
realities
dreamers
for
whom
life
delights
to
lie
in
wait
but
above
all
they
are
in
absentmindedness
with
this
superiority
over
their
fellows
that
their
absentmindedness
is
systematic
and
organised
around
one
central
idea
and
that
their
mishaps
are
also
quite
coherent
thanks
to
the
inexorable
logic
which
reality
applies
to
the
correction
of
dreams
so
that
they
kindle
in
those
around
them
by
a
series
of
cumulative
effects
a
hilarity
capable
of
unlimited
expansion
now
let
us
go
a
little
further
might
not
certain
vices
have
the
same
relation
to
character
that
the
rigidity
of
a
fixed
idea
has
to
intellect
whether
as
a
moral
kink
or
a
crooked
twist
given
to
the
will
vice
has
often
the
appearance
of
a
curvature
of
the
soul
doubtless
there
are
vices
into
which
the
soul
plunges
deeply
with
all
its
pregnant
potency
which
it
rejuvenates
and
drags
along
with
it
into
a
moving
circle
of
reincarnations
those
are
tragic
vices
but
the
vice
capable
of
making
us
comic
is
on
the
contrary
that
which
is
brought
from
without
like
a
frame
into
which
we
are
to
step
it
lends
us
its
own
rigidity
instead
of
borrowing
from
us
our
flexibility
we
do
not
render
it
more
complicated
on
the
contrary
it
simplifies
us
here
as
we
shall
see
later
on
in
the
concluding
section
of
this
study
lies
the
essential
difference
between
comedy
and
drama
a
drama
even
when
portraying
passions
or
vices
that
bear
a
name
so
completely
incorporates
them
in
the
person
that
their
names
are
forgotten
their
general
characteristics
effaced
and
we
no
longer
think
of
them
at
all
but
rather
of
the
person
in
whom
they
are
assimilated
hence
the
title
of
a
drama
can
seldom
be
anything
else
than
a
proper
noun
on
the
other
hand
many
comedies
have
a
common
noun
as
their
title
le
joueur
etc
were
you
asked
to
think
of
a
play
capable
of
being
called
le
jaloux
for
instance
you
would
find
that
sganarelle
or
george
dandin
would
occur
to
your
mind
but
not
othello
le
jaloux
could
only
be
the
title
of
a
comedy
the
reason
is
that
however
intimately
vice
when
comic
is
associated
with
persons
it
none
the
less
retains
its
simple
independent
existence
it
remains
the
central
character
present
though
invisible
to
which
the
characters
in
flesh
and
blood
on
the
stage
are
attached
at
times
it
delights
in
dragging
them
down
with
its
own
weight
and
making
them
share
in
its
tumbles
more
frequently
however
it
plays
on
them
as
on
an
instrument
or
pulls
the
strings
as
though
they
were
puppets
look
closely
you
will
find
that
the
art
of
the
comic
poet
consists
in
making
us
so
well
acquainted
with
the
particular
vice
in
introducing
us
the
spectators
to
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
with
it
that
in
the
end
we
get
hold
of
some
of
the
strings
of
the
marionette
with
which
he
is
playing
and
actually
work
them
ourselves
this
it
is
that
explains
part
of
the
pleasure
we
feel
here
too
it
is
really
a
kind
of
automatism
that
makes
us
laugh
an
automatism
as
we
have
already
remarked
closely
akin
to
mere
absentmindedness
to
realise
this
more
fully
it
need
only
be
noted
that
a
comic
character
is
generally
comic
in
proportion
to
his
ignorance
of
himself
the
comic
person
is
unconscious
as
though
wearing
the
ring
of
gyges
with
reverse
effect
he
becomes
invisible
to
himself
while
remaining
visible
to
all
the
world
a
character
in
a
tragedy
will
make
no
change
in
his
conduct
because
he
will
know
how
it
is
judged
by
us
he
may
continue
therein
even
though
fully
conscious
of
what
he
is
and
feeling
keenly
the
horror
he
inspires
in
us
but
a
defect
that
is
ridiculous
as
soon
as
it
feels
itself
to
be
so
endeavours
to
modify
itself
or
at
least
to
appear
as
though
it
did
were
harpagon
to
see
us
laugh
at
his
miserliness
i
do
not
say
that
he
would
get
rid
of
it
but
he
would
either
show
it
less
or
show
it
differently
indeed
it
is
in
this
sense
only
that
laughter
corrects
men
manners
it
makes
us
at
once
endeavour
to
appear
what
we
ought
to
be
what
some
day
we
shall
perhaps
end
in
being
it
is
unnecessary
to
carry
this
analysis
any
further
from
the
runner
who
falls
to
the
simpleton
who
is
hoaxed
from
a
state
of
being
hoaxed
to
one
of
absentmindedness
from
absentmindedness
to
wild
enthusiasm
from
wild
enthusiasm
to
various
distortions
of
character
and
will
we
have
followed
the
line
of
progress
along
which
the
comic
becomes
more
and
more
deeply
imbedded
in
the
person
yet
without
ceasing
in
its
subtler
manifestations
to
recall
to
us
some
trace
of
what
we
noticed
in
its
grosser
forms
an
effect
of
automatism
and
of
inelasticity
now
we
can
obtain
a
first
glimpse
a
distant
one
it
is
true
and
still
hazy
and
confused
of
the
laughable
side
of
human
nature
and
of
the
ordinary
function
of
laughter
what
life
and
society
require
of
each
of
us
is
a
constantly
alert
attention
that
discerns
the
outlines
of
the
present
situation
together
with
a
certain
elasticity
of
mind
and
body
to
enable
us
to
adapt
ourselves
in
consequence
tension
and
elasticity
are
two
forces
mutually
complementary
which
life
brings
into
play
if
these
two
forces
are
lacking
in
the
body
to
any
considerable
extent
we
have
sickness
and
infirmity
and
accidents
of
every
kind
if
they
are
lacking
in
the
mind
we
find
every
degree
of
mental
deficiency
every
variety
of
insanity
finally
if
they
are
lacking
in
the
character
we
have
cases
of
the
gravest
inadaptability
to
social
life
which
are
the
sources
of
misery
and
at
times
the
causes
of
crime
once
these
elements
of
inferiority
that
affect
the
serious
side
of
existence
are
removed
and
they
tend
to
eliminate
themselves
in
what
has
been
called
the
struggle
for
life
the
person
can
live
and
that
in
common
with
other
persons
but
society
asks
for
something
more
it
is
not
satisfied
with
simply
living
it
insists
on
living
well
what
it
now
has
to
dread
is
that
each
one
of
us
content
with
paying
attention
to
what
affects
the
essentials
of
life
will
so
far
as
the
rest
is
concerned
give
way
to
the
easy
automatism
of
acquired
habits
another
thing
it
must
fear
is
that
the
members
of
whom
it
is
made
up
instead
of
aiming
after
an
increasingly
delicate
adjustment
of
wills
which
will
fit
more
and
more
perfectly
into
one
another
will
confine
themselves
to
respecting
simply
the
fundamental
conditions
of
this
adjustment
a
agreement
among
the
persons
will
not
satisfy
it
it
insists
on
a
constant
striving
after
reciprocal
adaptation
society
will
therefore
be
suspicious
of
all
inelasticity
of
character
of
mind
and
even
of
body
because
it
is
the
possible
sign
of
a
slumbering
activity
as
well
as
of
an
activity
with
separatist
tendencies
that
inclines
to
swerve
from
the
common
centre
round
which
society
gravitates
in
short
because
it
is
the
sign
of
an
eccentricity
and
yet
society
can
not
intervene
at
this
stage
by
material
repression
since
it
is
not
affected
in
a
material
fashion
it
is
confronted
with
something
that
makes
it
uneasy
but
only
as
a
symptom
scarcely
a
threat
at
the
very
most
a
gesture
a
gesture
therefore
will
be
its
reply
laughter
must
be
something
of
this
kind
a
sort
of
social
gesture
by
the
fear
which
it
inspires
it
restrains
eccentricity
keeps
constantly
awake
and
in
mutual
contact
certain
activities
of
a
secondary
order
which
might
retire
into
their
shell
and
go
to
sleep
and
in
short
softens
down
whatever
the
surface
of
the
social
body
may
retain
of
mechanical
inelasticity
laughter
then
does
not
belong
to
the
province
of
esthetics
alone
since
unconsciously
and
even
immorally
in
many
particular
instances
it
pursues
a
utilitarian
aim
of
general
improvement
and
yet
there
is
something
esthetic
about
it
since
the
comic
comes
into
being
just
when
society
and
the
individual
freed
from
the
worry
of
begin
to
regard
themselves
as
works
of
art
in
a
word
if
a
circle
be
drawn
round
those
actions
and
dispositions
implied
in
individual
or
social
life
to
which
their
natural
consequences
bring
their
own
penalties
there
remains
outside
this
sphere
of
emotion
and
struggle
and
within
a
neutral
zone
in
which
man
simply
exposes
himself
to
man
curiosity
a
certain
rigidity
of
body
mind
and
character
that
society
would
still
like
to
get
rid
of
in
order
to
obtain
from
its
members
the
greatest
possible
degree
of
elasticity
and
sociability
this
rigidity
is
the
comic
and
laughter
is
its
corrective
still
we
must
not
accept
this
formula
as
a
definition
of
the
comic
it
is
suitable
only
for
cases
that
are
elementary
theoretical
and
perfect
in
which
the
comic
is
free
from
all
adulteration
nor
do
we
offer
it
either
as
an
explanation
we
prefer
to
make
it
if
you
will
the
leitmotiv
which
is
to
accompany
all
our
explanations
we
must
ever
keep
it
in
mind
though
without
dwelling
on
it
too
much
somewhat
as
a
skilful
fencer
must
think
of
the
discontinuous
movements
of
the
lesson
whilst
his
body
is
given
up
to
the
continuity
of
the
we
will
now
endeavour
to
reconstruct
the
sequence
of
comic
forms
taking
up
again
the
thread
that
leads
from
the
horseplay
of
a
clown
up
to
the
most
refined
effects
of
comedy
following
this
thread
in
its
often
unforeseen
windings
halting
at
intervals
to
look
around
and
finally
getting
back
if
possible
to
the
point
at
which
the
thread
is
dangling
and
where
we
shall
perhaps
find
since
the
comic
oscillates
between
life
and
art
the
general
relation
that
art
bears
to
life
iii
let
us
begin
at
the
simplest
point
what
is
a
comic
physiognomy
where
does
a
ridiculous
expression
of
the
face
come
from
and
what
is
in
this
case
the
distinction
between
the
comic
and
the
ugly
thus
stated
the
question
could
scarcely
be
answered
in
any
other
than
an
arbitrary
fashion
simple
though
it
may
appear
it
is
even
now
too
subtle
to
allow
of
a
direct
attack
we
should
have
to
begin
with
a
definition
of
ugliness
and
then
discover
what
addition
the
comic
makes
to
it
now
ugliness
is
not
much
easier
to
analyse
than
is
beauty
however
we
will
employ
an
artifice
which
will
often
stand
us
in
good
stead
we
will
exaggerate
the
problem
so
to
speak
by
magnifying
the
effect
to
the
point
of
making
the
cause
visible
suppose
then
we
intensify
ugliness
to
the
point
of
deformity
and
study
the
transition
from
the
deformed
to
the
ridiculous
now
certain
deformities
undoubtedly
possess
over
others
the
sorry
privilege
of
causing
some
persons
to
laugh
some
hunchbacks
for
instance
will
excite
laughter
without
at
this
point
entering
into
useless
details
we
will
simply
ask
the
reader
to
think
of
a
number
of
deformities
and
then
to
divide
them
into
two
groups
on
the
one
hand
those
which
nature
has
directed
towards
the
ridiculous
and
on
the
other
those
which
absolutely
diverge
from
it
no
doubt
he
will
hit
upon
the
following
law
a
deformity
that
may
become
comic
is
a
deformity
that
a
normally
built
person
could
successfully
imitate
is
it
not
then
the
case
that
the
hunchback
suggests
the
appearance
of
a
person
who
holds
himself
badly
his
back
seems
to
have
contracted
an
ugly
stoop
by
a
kind
of
physical
obstinacy
by
rigidity
in
a
word
it
persists
in
the
habit
it
has
contracted
try
to
see
with
your
eyes
alone
avoid
reflection
and
above
all
do
not
reason
abandon
all
your
prepossessions
seek
to
recapture
a
fresh
direct
and
primitive
impression
the
vision
you
will
reacquire
will
be
one
of
this
kind
you
will
have
before
you
a
man
bent
on
cultivating
a
certain
rigid
attitude
whose
body
if
one
may
use
the
expression
is
one
vast
grin
now
let
us
go
back
to
the
point
we
wished
to
clear
up
by
toning
down
a
deformity
that
is
laughable
we
ought
to
obtain
an
ugliness
that
is
comic
a
laughable
expression
of
the
face
then
is
one
that
will
make
us
think
of
something
rigid
and
so
to
speak
coagulated
in
the
wonted
mobility
of
the
face
what
we
shall
see
will
be
an
ingrained
twitching
or
a
fixed
grimace
it
may
be
objected
that
every
habitual
expression
of
the
face
even
when
graceful
and
beautiful
gives
us
this
same
impression
of
something
stereotyped
here
an
important
distinction
must
be
drawn
when
we
speak
of
expressive
beauty
or
even
expressive
ugliness
when
we
say
that
a
face
possesses
expression
we
mean
expression
that
may
be
stable
but
which
we
conjecture
to
be
mobile
it
maintains
in
the
midst
of
its
fixity
a
certain
indecision
in
which
are
obscurely
portrayed
all
possible
shades
of
the
state
of
mind
it
expresses
just
as
the
sunny
promise
of
a
warm
day
manifests
itself
in
the
haze
of
a
spring
morning
but
a
comic
expression
of
the
face
is
one
that
promises
nothing
more
than
it
gives
it
is
a
unique
and
permanent
grimace
one
would
say
that
the
person
whole
moral
life
has
crystallised
into
this
particular
cast
of
features
this
is
the
reason
why
a
face
is
all
the
more
comic
the
more
nearly
it
suggests
to
us
the
idea
of
some
simple
mechanical
action
in
which
its
personality
would
for
ever
be
absorbed
some
faces
seem
to
be
always
engaged
in
weeping
others
in
laughing
or
whistling
others
again
in
eternally
blowing
an
imaginary
trumpet
and
these
are
the
most
comic
faces
of
all
here
again
is
exemplified
the
law
according
to
which
the
more
natural
the
explanation
of
the
cause
the
more
comic
is
the
effect
automatism
inelasticity
habit
that
has
been
contracted
and
maintained
are
clearly
the
causes
why
a
face
makes
us
laugh
but
this
effect
gains
in
intensity
when
we
are
able
to
connect
these
characteristics
with
some
cause
a
certain
fundamental
absentmindedness
as
though
the
soul
had
allowed
itself
to
be
fascinated
and
hypnotised
by
the
materiality
of
a
simple
action
we
shall
now
understand
the
comic
element
in
caricature
however
regular
we
may
imagine
a
face
to
be
however
harmonious
its
lines
and
supple
its
movements
their
adjustment
is
never
altogether
perfect
there
will
always
be
discoverable
the
signs
of
some
impending
bias
the
vague
suggestion
of
a
possible
grimace
in
short
some
favourite
distortion
towards
which
nature
seems
to
be
particularly
inclined
the
art
of
the
caricaturist
consists
in
detecting
this
at
times
imperceptible
tendency
and
in
rendering
it
visible
to
all
eyes
by
magnifying
it
he
makes
his
models
grimace
as
they
would
do
themselves
if
they
went
to
the
end
of
their
tether
beneath
the
harmony
of
form
he
divines
the
recalcitrance
of
matter
he
realises
disproportions
and
deformations
which
must
have
existed
in
nature
as
mere
inclinations
but
which
have
not
succeeded
in
coming
to
a
head
being
held
in
check
by
a
higher
force
his
art
which
has
a
touch
of
the
diabolical
raises
up
the
demon
who
had
been
overthrown
by
the
angel
certainly
it
is
an
art
that
exaggerates
and
yet
the
definition
would
be
very
far
from
complete
were
exaggeration
alone
alleged
to
be
its
aim
and
object
for
there
exist
caricatures
that
are
more
lifelike
than
portraits
caricatures
in
which
the
exaggeration
is
scarcely
noticeable
whilst
inversely
it
is
quite
possible
to
exaggerate
to
excess
without
obtaining
a
real
caricature
for
exaggeration
to
be
comic
it
must
not
appear
as
an
aim
but
rather
as
a
means
that
the
artist
is
using
in
order
to
make
manifest
to
our
eyes
the
distortions
which
he
sees
in
embryo
it
is
this
process
of
distortion
that
is
of
moment
and
interest
and
that
is
precisely
why
we
shall
look
for
it
even
in
those
elements
of
the
face
that
are
incapable
of
movement
in
the
curve
of
a
nose
or
the
shape
of
an
ear
for
in
our
eyes
form
is
always
the
outline
of
a
movement
the
caricaturist
who
alters
the
size
of
a
nose
but
respects
its
ground
plan
lengthening
it
for
instance
in
the
very
direction
in
which
it
was
being
lengthened
by
nature
is
really
making
the
nose
indulge
in
a
grin
henceforth
we
shall
always
look
upon
the
original
as
having
determined
to
lengthen
itself
and
start
grinning
in
this
sense
one
might
say
that
nature
herself
often
meets
with
the
successes
of
a
caricaturist
in
the
movement
through
which
she
has
slit
that
mouth
curtailed
that
chin
and
bulged
out
that
cheek
she
would
appear
to
have
succeeded
in
completing
the
intended
grimace
thus
outwitting
the
restraining
supervision
of
a
more
reasonable
force
in
that
case
the
face
we
laugh
at
is
so
to
speak
its
own
caricature
to
sum
up
whatever
be
the
doctrine
to
which
our
reason
assents
our
imagination
has
a
very
philosophy
of
its
own
in
every
human
form
it
sees
the
effort
of
a
soul
which
is
shaping
matter
a
soul
which
is
infinitely
supple
and
perpetually
in
motion
subject
to
no
law
of
gravitation
for
it
is
not
the
earth
that
attracts
it
this
soul
imparts
a
portion
of
its
winged
lightness
to
the
body
it
animates
the
immateriality
which
thus
passes
into
matter
is
what
is
called
gracefulness
matter
however
is
obstinate
and
resists
it
draws
to
itself
the
activity
of
this
higher
principle
would
fain
convert
it
to
its
own
inertia
and
cause
it
to
revert
to
mere
automatism
it
would
fain
immobilise
the
intelligently
varied
movements
of
the
body
in
stupidly
contracted
grooves
stereotype
in
permanent
grimaces
the
fleeting
expressions
of
the
face
in
short
imprint
on
the
whole
person
such
an
attitude
as
to
make
it
appear
immersed
and
absorbed
in
the
materiality
of
some
mechanical
occupation
instead
of
ceaselessly
renewing
its
vitality
by
keeping
in
touch
with
a
living
ideal
where
matter
thus
succeeds
in
dulling
the
outward
life
of
the
soul
in
petrifying
its
movements
and
thwarting
its
gracefulness
it
achieves
at
the
expense
of
the
body
an
effect
that
is
comic
if
then
at
this
point
we
wished
to
define
the
comic
by
comparing
it
with
its
contrary
we
should
have
to
contrast
it
with
gracefulness
even
more
than
with
beauty
it
partakes
rather
of
the
unsprightly
than
of
the
unsightly
of
rigidness
rather
than
of
ugliness
iv
we
will
now
pass
from
the
comic
element
in
forms
to
that
in
gestures
and
movements
let
us
at
once
state
the
law
which
seems
to
govern
all
the
phenomena
of
this
kind
it
may
indeed
be
deduced
without
any
difficulty
from
the
considerations
stated
above
the
attitudes
gestures
and
movements
of
the
human
body
are
laughable
in
exact
proportion
as
that
body
reminds
us
of
a
mere
machine
there
is
no
need
to
follow
this
law
through
the
details
of
its
immediate
applications
which
are
innumerable
to
verify
it
directly
it
would
be
sufficient
to
study
closely
the
work
of
comic
artists
eliminating
entirely
the
element
of
caricature
and
omitting
that
portion
of
the
comic
which
is
not
inherent
in
the
drawing
itself
for
obviously
the
comic
element
in
a
drawing
is
often
a
borrowed
one
for
which
the
text
supplies
all
the
i
mean
that
the
artist
may
be
his
own
understudy
in
the
shape
of
a
satirist
or
even
a
playwright
and
that
then
we
laugh
far
less
at
the
drawings
themselves
than
at
the
satire
or
comic
incident
they
represent
but
if
we
devote
our
whole
attention
to
the
drawing
with
the
firm
resolve
to
think
of
nothing
else
we
shall
probably
find
that
it
is
generally
comic
in
proportion
to
the
clearness
as
well
as
the
subtleness
with
which
it
enables
us
to
see
a
man
as
a
jointed
puppet
the
suggestion
must
be
a
clear
one
for
inside
the
person
we
must
distinctly
perceive
as
though
through
a
glass
a
mechanism
but
the
suggestion
must
also
be
a
subtle
one
for
the
general
appearance
of
the
person
whose
every
limb
has
been
made
rigid
as
a
machine
must
continue
to
give
us
the
impression
of
a
living
being
the
more
exactly
these
two
images
that
of
a
person
and
that
of
a
machine
fit
into
each
other
the
more
striking
is
the
comic
effect
and
the
more
consummate
the
art
of
the
draughtsman
the
originality
of
a
comic
artist
is
thus
expressed
in
the
special
kind
of
life
he
imparts
to
a
mere
puppet
we
will
however
leave
on
one
side
the
immediate
application
of
the
principle
and
at
this
point
insist
only
on
the
more
remote
consequences
the
illusion
of
a
machine
working
in
the
inside
of
the
person
is
a
thing
that
only
crops
up
amid
a
host
of
amusing
effects
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
fleeting
glimpse
that
is
immediately
lost
in
the
laughter
it
provokes
to
render
it
permanent
analysis
and
reflection
must
be
called
into
play
in
a
public
speaker
for
instance
we
find
that
gesture
vies
with
speech
jealous
of
the
latter
gesture
closely
dogs
the
thought
demanding
also
to
act
as
interpreter
well
and
good
but
then
it
must
pledge
itself
to
follow
thought
through
all
the
phases
of
its
development
an
idea
is
something
that
grows
buds
blossoms
and
ripens
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
a
speech
it
never
halts
never
repeats
itself
it
must
be
changing
every
moment
for
to
cease
to
change
would
be
to
cease
to
live
then
let
gesture
display
a
like
animation
let
it
accept
the
fundamental
law
of
life
which
is
the
complete
negation
of
repetition
but
i
find
that
a
certain
movement
of
head
or
arm
a
movement
always
the
same
seems
to
return
at
regular
intervals
if
i
notice
it
and
it
succeeds
in
diverting
my
attention
if
i
wait
for
it
to
occur
and
it
occurs
when
i
expect
it
then
involuntarily
i
laugh
why
because
i
now
have
before
me
a
machine
that
works
automatically
this
is
no
longer
life
it
is
automatism
established
in
life
and
imitating
it
it
belongs
to
the
comic
this
is
also
the
reason
why
gestures
at
which
we
never
dreamt
of
laughing
become
laughable
when
imitated
by
another
individual
the
most
elaborate
explanations
have
been
offered
for
this
extremely
simple
fact
a
little
reflection
however
will
show
that
our
mental
state
is
ever
changing
and
that
if
our
gestures
faithfully
followed
these
inner
movements
if
they
were
as
fully
alive
as
we
they
would
never
repeat
themselves
and
so
would
keep
imitation
at
bay
we
begin
then
to
become
imitable
only
when
we
cease
to
be
ourselves
i
mean
our
gestures
can
only
be
imitated
in
their
mechanical
uniformity
and
therefore
exactly
in
what
is
alien
to
our
living
personality
to
imitate
any
one
is
to
bring
out
the
element
of
automatism
he
has
allowed
to
creep
into
his
person
and
as
this
is
the
very
essence
of
the
ludicrous
it
is
no
wonder
that
imitation
gives
rise
to
laughter
still
if
the
imitation
of
gestures
is
intrinsically
laughable
it
will
become
even
more
so
when
it
busies
itself
in
deflecting
them
though
without
altering
their
form
towards
some
mechanical
occupation
such
as
sawing
wood
striking
on
an
anvil
or
tugging
away
at
an
imaginary
not
that
vulgarity
is
the
essence
of
the
comic
although
certainly
it
is
to
some
extent
an
ingredient
but
rather
that
the
incriminated
gesture
seems
more
frankly
mechanical
when
it
can
be
connected
with
a
simple
operation
as
though
it
were
intentionally
mechanical
to
suggest
this
mechanical
interpretation
ought
to
be
one
of
the
favourite
devices
of
parody
we
have
reached
this
result
through
deduction
but
i
imagine
clowns
have
long
had
an
intuition
of
the
fact
this
seems
to
me
the
solution
of
the
little
riddle
propounded
by
pascal
in
one
passage
of
his
thoughts
two
faces
that
are
alike
although
neither
of
them
excites
laughter
by
itself
make
us
laugh
when
together
on
account
of
their
likeness
it
might
just
as
well
be
said
the
gestures
of
a
public
speaker
no
one
of
which
is
laughable
by
itself
excite
laughter
by
their
repetition
the
truth
is
that
a
really
living
life
should
never
repeat
itself
wherever
there
is
repetition
or
complete
similarity
we
always
suspect
some
mechanism
at
work
behind
the
living
analyse
the
impression
you
get
from
two
faces
that
are
too
much
alike
and
you
will
find
that
you
are
thinking
of
two
copies
cast
in
the
same
mould
or
two
impressions
of
the
same
seal
or
two
reproductions
of
the
same
negative
in
a
word
of
some
manufacturing
process
or
other
this
deflection
of
life
towards
the
mechanical
is
here
the
real
cause
of
laughter
and
laughter
will
be
more
pronounced
still
if
we
find
on
the
stage
not
merely
two
characters
as
in
the
example
from
pascal
but
several
nay
as
great
a
number
as
possible
the
image
of
one
another
who
come
and
go
dance
and
gesticulate
together
simultaneously
striking
the
same
attitudes
and
tossing
their
arms
about
in
the
same
manner
this
time
we
distinctly
think
of
marionettes
invisible
threads
seem
to
us
to
be
joining
arms
to
arms
legs
to
legs
each
muscle
in
one
face
to
its
in
the
other
by
reason
of
the
absolute
uniformity
which
prevails
the
very
litheness
of
the
bodies
seems
to
stiffen
as
we
gaze
and
the
actors
themselves
seem
transformed
into
automata
such
at
least
appears
to
be
the
artifice
underlying
this
somewhat
obvious
form
of
amusement
i
daresay
the
performers
have
never
read
pascal
but
what
they
do
is
merely
to
realise
to
the
full
the
suggestions
contained
in
pascal
words
if
as
is
undoubtedly
the
case
laughter
is
caused
in
the
second
instance
by
the
hallucination
of
a
mechanical
effect
it
must
already
have
been
so
though
in
more
subtle
fashion
in
the
first
continuing
along
this
path
we
dimly
perceive
the
increasingly
important
and
consequences
of
the
law
we
have
just
stated
we
faintly
catch
still
more
fugitive
glimpses
of
mechanical
effects
glimpses
suggested
by
man
complex
actions
no
longer
merely
by
his
gestures
we
instinctively
feel
that
the
usual
devices
of
comedy
the
periodical
repetition
of
a
word
or
a
scene
the
systematic
inversion
of
the
parts
the
geometrical
development
of
a
farcical
misunderstanding
and
many
other
stage
contrivances
must
derive
their
comic
force
from
the
same
source
the
art
of
the
playwright
probably
consisting
in
setting
before
us
an
obvious
clockwork
arrangement
of
human
events
while
carefully
preserving
an
outward
aspect
of
probability
and
thereby
retaining
something
of
the
suppleness
of
life
but
we
must
not
forestall
results
which
will
be
duly
disclosed
in
the
course
of
our
analysis
v
before
going
further
let
us
halt
a
moment
and
glance
around
as
we
hinted
at
the
outset
of
this
study
it
would
be
idle
to
attempt
to
derive
every
comic
effect
from
one
simple
formula
the
formula
exists
well
enough
in
a
certain
sense
but
its
development
does
not
follow
a
straightforward
course
what
i
mean
is
that
the
process
of
deduction
ought
from
time
to
time
to
stop
and
study
certain
culminating
effects
and
that
these
effects
each
appear
as
models
round
which
new
effects
resembling
them
take
their
places
in
a
circle
these
latter
are
not
deductions
from
the
formula
but
are
comic
through
their
relationship
with
those
that
are
to
quote
pascal
again
i
see
no
objection
at
this
stage
to
defining
the
process
by
the
curve
which
that
geometrician
studied
under
the
name
of
roulette
or
cycloid
the
curve
traced
by
a
point
in
the
circumference
of
a
wheel
when
the
carriage
is
advancing
in
a
straight
line
this
point
turns
like
the
wheel
though
it
advances
like
the
carriage
or
else
we
might
think
of
an
immense
avenue
such
as
are
to
be
seen
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
with
crosses
at
intervals
to
indicate
the
at
each
of
these
we
shall
walk
round
the
cross
explore
for
a
while
the
paths
that
open
out
before
us
and
then
return
to
our
original
course
now
we
have
just
reached
one
of
these
mental
crossways
something
mechanical
encrusted
on
the
living
will
represent
a
cross
at
which
we
must
halt
a
central
image
from
which
the
imagination
branches
off
in
different
directions
what
are
these
directions
there
appear
to
be
three
main
ones
we
will
follow
them
one
after
the
other
and
then
continue
our
onward
course
in
the
first
place
this
view
of
the
mechanical
and
the
living
dovetailed
into
each
other
makes
us
incline
towards
the
vaguer
image
of
some
rigidity
or
other
applied
to
the
mobility
of
life
in
an
awkward
attempt
to
follow
its
lines
and
counterfeit
its
suppleness
here
we
perceive
how
easy
it
is
for
a
garment
to
become
ridiculous
it
might
almost
be
said
that
every
fashion
is
laughable
in
some
respect
only
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
fashion
of
the
day
we
are
so
accustomed
to
it
that
the
garment
seems
in
our
mind
to
form
one
with
the
individual
wearing
it
we
do
not
separate
them
in
imagination
the
idea
no
longer
occurs
to
us
to
contrast
the
inert
rigidity
of
the
covering
with
the
living
suppleness
of
the
object
covered
consequently
the
comic
here
remains
in
a
latent
condition
it
will
only
succeed
in
emerging
when
the
natural
incompatibility
is
so
between
the
covering
and
the
covered
that
even
an
immemorial
association
fails
to
cement
this
union
a
case
in
point
is
our
head
and
top
hat
suppose
however
some
eccentric
individual
dresses
himself
in
the
fashion
of
former
times
our
attention
is
immediately
drawn
to
the
clothes
themselves
we
absolutely
distinguish
them
from
the
individual
we
say
that
the
latter
is
disguising
himself
as
though
every
article
of
clothing
were
not
a
disguise
and
the
laughable
aspect
of
fashion
comes
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
light
here
we
are
beginning
to
catch
a
faint
glimpse
of
the
highly
intricate
difficulties
raised
by
this
problem
of
the
comic
one
of
the
reasons
that
must
have
given
rise
to
many
erroneous
or
unsatisfactory
theories
of
laughter
is
that
many
things
are
comic
de
jure
without
being
comic
de
facto
the
continuity
of
custom
having
deadened
within
them
the
comic
quality
a
sudden
dissolution
of
continuity
is
needed
a
break
with
fashion
for
this
quality
to
revive
hence
the
impression
that
this
dissolution
of
continuity
is
the
parent
of
the
comic
whereas
all
it
does
is
to
bring
it
to
our
notice
hence
again
the
explanation
of
laughter
by
surprise
contrast
definitions
which
would
equally
apply
to
a
host
of
cases
in
which
we
have
no
inclination
whatever
to
laugh
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
far
from
being
so
simple
but
to
return
to
our
idea
of
disguise
which
as
we
have
just
shown
has
been
entrusted
with
the
special
mandate
of
arousing
laughter
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
investigate
the
uses
it
makes
of
this
power
why
do
we
laugh
at
a
head
of
hair
which
has
changed
from
dark
to
blond
what
is
there
comic
about
a
rubicund
nose
and
why
does
one
laugh
at
a
negro
the
question
would
appear
to
be
an
embarrassing
one
for
it
has
been
asked
by
successive
psychologists
such
as
hecker
kraepelin
and
lipps
and
all
have
given
different
replies
and
yet
i
rather
fancy
the
correct
answer
was
suggested
to
me
one
day
in
the
street
by
an
ordinary
cabby
who
applied
the
expression
unwashed
to
the
negro
fare
he
was
driving
unwashed
does
not
this
mean
that
a
black
face
in
our
imagination
is
one
daubed
over
with
ink
or
soot
if
so
then
a
red
nose
can
only
be
one
which
has
received
a
coating
of
vermilion
and
so
we
see
that
the
notion
of
disguise
has
passed
on
something
of
its
comic
quality
to
instances
in
which
there
is
actually
no
disguise
though
there
might
be
in
the
former
set
of
examples
although
his
usual
dress
was
distinct
from
the
individual
it
appeared
in
our
mind
to
form
one
with
him
because
we
had
become
accustomed
to
the
sight
in
the
latter
although
the
black
or
red
colour
is
indeed
inherent
in
the
skin
we
look
upon
it
as
artificially
laid
on
because
it
surprises
us
but
here
we
meet
with
a
fresh
crop
of
difficulties
in
the
theory
of
the
comic
such
a
proposition
as
the
following
my
usual
dress
forms
part
of
my
body
is
absurd
in
the
eyes
of
reason
yet
imagination
looks
upon
it
as
true
a
red
nose
is
a
painted
nose
a
negro
is
a
white
man
in
disguise
are
also
absurd
to
the
reason
which
rationalises
but
they
are
gospel
truths
to
pure
imagination
so
there
is
a
logic
of
the
imagination
which
is
not
the
logic
of
reason
one
which
at
times
is
even
opposed
to
the
latter
with
which
however
philosophy
must
reckon
not
only
in
the
study
of
the
comic
but
in
every
other
investigation
of
the
same
kind
it
is
something
like
the
logic
of
dreams
though
of
dreams
that
have
not
been
left
to
the
whim
of
individual
fancy
being
the
dreams
dreamt
by
the
whole
of
society
in
order
to
reconstruct
this
hidden
logic
a
special
kind
of
effort
is
needed
by
which
the
outer
crust
of
carefully
stratified
judgments
and
firmly
established
ideas
will
be
lifted
and
we
shall
behold
in
the
depths
of
our
mind
like
a
sheet
of
subterranean
water
the
flow
of
an
unbroken
stream
of
images
which
pass
from
one
into
another
this
interpenetration
of
images
does
not
come
about
by
chance
it
obeys
laws
or
rather
habits
which
hold
the
same
relation
to
imagination
that
logic
does
to
thought
let
us
then
follow
this
logic
of
the
imagination
in
the
special
case
in
hand
a
man
in
disguise
is
comic
a
man
we
regard
as
disguised
is
also
comic
so
by
analogy
any
disguise
is
seen
to
become
comic
not
only
that
of
a
man
but
that
of
society
also
and
even
the
disguise
of
nature
let
us
start
with
nature
you
laugh
at
a
dog
that
is
at
a
bed
of
artificially
coloured
flowers
at
a
wood
in
which
the
trees
are
plastered
over
with
election
addresses
etc
look
for
the
reason
and
you
will
see
that
you
are
once
more
thinking
of
a
masquerade
here
however
the
comic
element
is
very
faint
it
is
too
far
from
its
source
if
you
wish
to
strengthen
it
you
must
go
back
to
the
source
itself
and
contrast
the
derived
image
that
of
a
masquerade
with
the
original
one
which
be
it
remembered
was
that
of
a
mechanical
tampering
with
life
in
a
nature
that
is
mechanically
tampered
with
we
possess
a
thoroughly
comic
theme
on
which
fancy
will
be
able
to
play
ever
so
many
variations
with
the
certainty
of
successfully
provoking
the
heartiest
hilarity
you
may
call
to
mind
that
amusing
passage
in
tartarin
sur
les
alpes
in
which
bompard
makes
tartarin
and
therefore
also
the
reader
to
some
slight
extent
accept
the
idea
of
a
switzerland
of
machinery
like
the
basement
of
the
opera
and
run
by
a
company
which
maintains
a
series
of
waterfalls
glaciers
and
artificial
crevasses
the
same
theme
reappears
though
transposed
in
quite
another
key
in
the
novel
notes
of
the
english
humorist
jerome
jerome
an
elderly
lady
bountiful
who
does
not
want
her
deeds
of
charity
to
take
up
too
much
of
her
time
provides
homes
within
easy
hail
of
her
mansion
for
the
conversion
of
atheists
who
have
been
specially
manufactured
for
her
so
to
speak
and
for
a
number
of
honest
folk
who
have
been
made
into
drunkards
so
that
she
may
cure
them
of
their
failing
etc
there
are
comic
phrases
in
which
this
theme
is
audible
like
a
distant
echo
coupled
with
an
ingenuousness
whether
sincere
or
affected
which
acts
as
accompaniment
take
as
an
instance
the
remark
made
by
a
lady
whom
cassini
the
astronomer
had
invited
to
see
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
arriving
too
late
she
said
de
cassini
i
know
will
have
the
goodness
to
begin
it
all
over
again
to
please
me
or
take
again
the
exclamation
of
one
of
characters
on
arriving
in
a
town
and
learning
that
there
is
an
extinct
volcano
in
the
neighbourhood
they
had
a
volcano
and
they
have
let
it
go
out
let
us
go
on
to
society
as
we
are
both
in
and
of
it
we
can
not
help
treating
it
as
a
living
being
any
image
then
suggestive
of
the
notion
of
a
society
disguising
itself
or
of
a
social
masquerade
so
to
speak
will
be
laughable
now
such
a
notion
is
formed
when
we
perceive
anything
inert
or
stereotyped
or
simply
on
the
surface
of
living
society
there
we
have
rigidity
over
again
clashing
with
the
inner
suppleness
of
life
the
ceremonial
side
of
social
life
must
therefore
always
include
a
latent
comic
element
which
is
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
burst
into
full
view
it
might
be
said
that
ceremonies
are
to
the
social
body
what
clothing
is
to
the
individual
body
they
owe
their
seriousness
to
the
fact
that
they
are
identified
in
our
minds
with
the
serious
object
with
which
custom
associates
them
and
when
we
isolate
them
in
imagination
they
forthwith
lose
their
seriousness
for
any
ceremony
then
to
become
comic
it
is
enough
that
our
attention
be
fixed
on
the
ceremonial
element
in
it
and
that
we
neglect
its
matter
as
philosophers
say
and
think
only
of
its
form
every
one
knows
how
easily
the
comic
spirit
exercises
its
ingenuity
on
social
actions
of
a
stereotyped
nature
from
an
ordinary
to
the
solemn
sitting
of
a
court
of
justice
any
form
or
formula
is
a
frame
into
which
the
comic
element
may
be
fitted
here
again
the
comic
will
be
emphasised
by
bringing
it
nearer
to
its
source
from
the
idea
of
travesty
a
derived
one
we
must
go
back
to
the
original
idea
that
of
a
mechanism
superposed
upon
life
already
the
stiff
and
starched
formality
of
any
ceremonial
suggests
to
us
an
image
of
this
kind
for
as
soon
as
we
forget
the
serious
object
of
a
solemnity
or
a
ceremony
those
taking
part
in
it
give
us
the
impression
of
puppets
in
motion
their
mobility
seems
to
adopt
as
a
model
the
immobility
of
a
formula
it
becomes
automatism
but
complete
automatism
is
only
reached
in
the
official
for
instance
who
performs
his
duty
like
a
mere
machine
or
again
in
the
unconsciousness
that
marks
an
administrative
regulation
working
with
inexorable
fatality
and
setting
itself
up
for
a
law
of
nature
quite
by
chance
when
reading
the
newspaper
i
came
across
a
specimen
of
the
comic
of
this
type
twenty
years
ago
a
large
steamer
was
wrecked
off
the
coast
at
dieppe
with
considerable
difficulty
some
of
the
passengers
were
rescued
in
a
boat
a
few
officers
who
had
courageously
rushed
to
their
assistance
began
by
asking
them
if
they
had
anything
to
declare
we
find
something
similar
though
the
idea
is
a
more
subtle
one
in
the
remark
of
an
when
questioning
the
home
secretary
on
the
morrow
of
a
terrible
murder
which
took
place
in
a
railway
carriage
the
assassin
after
despatching
his
victim
must
have
got
out
the
wrong
side
of
the
train
thereby
infringing
the
company
rules
a
mechanical
element
introduced
into
nature
and
an
automatic
regulation
of
society
such
then
are
the
two
types
of
laughable
effects
at
which
we
have
arrived
it
remains
for
us
in
conclusion
to
combine
them
and
see
what
the
result
will
be
the
result
of
the
combination
will
evidently
be
a
human
regulation
of
affairs
usurping
the
place
of
the
laws
of
nature
we
may
call
to
mind
the
answer
sganarelle
gave
geronte
when
the
latter
remarked
that
the
heart
was
on
the
left
side
and
the
liver
on
the
right
yes
it
was
so
formerly
but
we
have
altered
all
that
now
we
practise
medicine
in
quite
a
new
way
we
may
also
recall
the
consultation
between
de
pourceaugnac
two
doctors
the
arguments
you
have
used
are
so
erudite
and
elegant
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
patient
not
to
be
hypochondriacally
melancholic
or
even
if
he
were
not
he
must
surely
become
so
because
of
the
elegance
of
the
things
you
have
said
and
the
accuracy
of
your
reasoning
we
might
multiply
examples
for
all
we
need
do
would
be
to
call
up
moliere
doctors
one
after
the
other
however
far
moreover
comic
fancy
may
seem
to
go
reality
at
times
undertakes
to
improve
upon
it
it
was
suggested
to
a
contemporary
philosopher
an
arguer
that
his
arguments
though
irreproachable
in
their
deductions
had
experience
against
them
he
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
by
merely
remarking
experience
is
in
the
wrong
the
truth
is
this
idea
of
regulating
life
as
a
matter
of
business
routine
is
more
widespread
than
might
be
imagined
it
is
natural
in
its
way
although
we
have
just
obtained
it
by
an
artificial
process
of
reconstruction
one
might
say
that
it
gives
us
the
very
quintessence
of
pedantry
which
at
bottom
is
nothing
else
than
art
pretending
to
outdo
nature
to
sum
up
then
we
have
one
and
the
same
effect
which
assumes
ever
subtler
forms
as
it
passes
from
the
idea
of
an
artificial
mechanisation
of
the
human
body
if
such
an
expression
is
permissible
to
that
of
any
substitution
whatsoever
of
the
artificial
for
the
natural
a
less
and
less
rigorous
logic
that
more
and
more
resembles
the
logic
of
dreamland
transfers
the
same
relationship
into
higher
and
higher
spheres
between
increasingly
immaterial
terms
till
in
the
end
we
find
a
mere
administrative
enactment
occupying
the
same
relation
to
a
natural
or
moral
law
that
a
garment
for
instance
does
to
the
living
body
we
have
now
gone
right
to
the
end
of
the
first
of
the
three
directions
we
had
to
follow
let
us
turn
to
the
second
and
see
where
it
will
lead
us
our
is
again
something
mechanical
encrusted
upon
the
living
where
did
the
comic
come
from
in
this
case
it
came
from
the
fact
that
the
living
body
became
rigid
like
a
machine
accordingly
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
living
body
ought
to
be
the
perfection
of
suppleness
the
activity
of
a
principle
always
at
work
but
this
activity
would
really
belong
to
the
soul
rather
than
to
the
body
it
would
be
the
very
flame
of
life
kindled
within
us
by
a
higher
principle
and
perceived
through
the
body
as
if
through
a
glass
when
we
see
only
gracefulness
and
suppleness
in
the
living
body
it
is
because
we
disregard
in
it
the
elements
of
weight
of
resistance
and
in
a
word
of
matter
we
forget
its
materiality
and
think
only
of
its
vitality
a
vitality
which
we
regard
as
derived
from
the
very
principle
of
intellectual
and
moral
life
let
us
suppose
however
that
our
attention
is
drawn
to
this
material
side
of
the
body
that
so
far
from
sharing
in
the
lightness
and
subtlety
of
the
principle
with
which
it
is
animated
the
body
is
no
more
in
our
eyes
than
a
heavy
and
cumbersome
vesture
a
kind
of
irksome
ballast
which
holds
down
to
earth
a
soul
eager
to
rise
aloft
then
the
body
will
become
to
the
soul
what
as
we
have
just
seen
the
garment
was
to
the
body
itself
inert
matter
dumped
down
upon
living
energy
the
impression
of
the
comic
will
be
produced
as
soon
as
we
have
a
clear
apprehension
of
this
putting
the
one
on
the
other
and
we
shall
experience
it
most
strongly
when
we
are
shown
the
soul
tantalised
by
the
needs
of
the
body
on
the
one
hand
the
moral
personality
with
its
intelligently
varied
energy
and
on
the
other
the
stupidly
monotonous
body
perpetually
obstructing
everything
with
its
obstinacy
the
more
paltry
and
uniformly
repeated
these
claims
of
the
body
the
more
striking
will
be
the
result
but
that
is
only
a
matter
of
degree
and
the
general
law
of
these
phenomena
may
be
formulated
as
follows
any
incident
is
comic
that
calls
our
attention
to
the
physical
in
a
person
when
it
is
the
moral
side
that
is
concerned
why
do
we
laugh
at
a
public
speaker
who
sneezes
just
at
the
most
pathetic
moment
of
his
speech
where
lies
the
comic
element
in
this
sentence
taken
from
a
funeral
speech
and
quoted
by
a
german
philosopher
he
was
virtuous
and
plump
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
our
attention
is
suddenly
recalled
from
the
soul
to
the
body
similar
instances
abound
in
daily
life
but
if
you
do
not
care
to
take
the
trouble
to
look
for
them
you
have
only
to
open
at
random
a
volume
of
labiche
and
you
will
be
almost
certain
to
light
upon
an
effect
of
this
kind
now
we
have
a
speaker
whose
most
eloquent
sentences
are
cut
short
by
the
twinges
of
a
bad
tooth
now
one
of
the
characters
who
never
begins
to
speak
without
stopping
in
the
middle
to
complain
of
his
shoes
being
too
small
or
his
belt
too
tight
etc
a
person
embarrassed
by
his
body
is
the
image
suggested
to
us
in
all
these
examples
the
reason
that
excessive
stoutness
is
laughable
is
probably
because
it
calls
up
an
image
of
the
same
kind
i
almost
think
that
this
too
is
what
sometime
makes
bashfulness
somewhat
ridiculous
the
bashful
man
rather
gives
the
impression
of
a
person
embarrassed
by
his
body
looking
round
for
some
convenient
in
which
to
deposit
it
this
is
just
why
the
tragic
poet
is
so
careful
to
avoid
anything
calculated
to
attract
attention
to
the
material
side
of
his
heroes
no
sooner
does
anxiety
about
the
body
manifest
itself
than
the
intrusion
of
a
comic
element
is
to
be
feared
on
this
account
the
hero
in
a
tragedy
does
not
eat
or
drink
or
warm
himself
he
does
not
even
sit
down
any
more
than
can
be
helped
to
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
speech
would
imply
that
you
remembered
you
had
a
body
napoleon
who
was
a
psychologist
when
he
wished
to
be
so
had
noticed
that
the
transition
from
tragedy
to
comedy
is
effected
simply
by
sitting
down
in
the
journal
inedit
of
baron
gourgaud
when
speaking
of
an
interview
with
the
queen
of
prussia
after
the
battle
of
iena
he
expresses
himself
in
the
following
terms
she
received
me
in
tragic
fashion
like
chimene
justice
sire
justice
magdeburg
thus
she
continued
in
a
way
most
embarrassing
to
me
finally
to
make
her
change
her
style
i
requested
her
to
take
a
seat
this
is
the
best
method
for
cutting
short
a
tragic
scene
for
as
soon
as
you
are
seated
it
all
becomes
comedy
let
us
now
give
a
wider
scope
to
this
image
of
the
body
taking
precedence
of
the
soul
we
shall
obtain
something
more
general
the
manner
seeking
to
outdo
the
matter
the
letter
aiming
at
ousting
the
spirit
is
it
not
perchance
this
idea
that
comedy
is
trying
to
suggest
to
us
when
holding
up
a
profession
to
ridicule
it
makes
the
lawyer
the
magistrate
and
the
doctor
speak
as
though
health
and
justice
were
of
little
moment
the
main
point
being
that
we
should
have
lawyers
magistrates
and
doctors
and
that
all
outward
formalities
pertaining
to
these
professions
should
be
scrupulously
respected
and
so
we
find
the
means
substituted
for
the
end
the
manner
for
the
matter
no
longer
is
it
the
profession
that
is
made
for
the
public
but
rather
the
public
for
the
profession
constant
attention
to
form
and
the
mechanical
application
of
rules
here
bring
about
a
kind
of
professional
automatism
analogous
to
that
imposed
upon
the
soul
by
the
habits
of
the
body
and
equally
laughable
numerous
are
the
examples
of
this
on
the
stage
without
entering
into
details
of
the
variations
executed
on
this
theme
let
us
quote
two
or
three
passages
in
which
the
theme
itself
is
set
forth
in
all
its
simplicity
you
are
only
bound
to
treat
people
according
to
form
says
doctor
diafoirus
in
the
malade
imaginaire
again
says
doctor
bahis
in
medecin
it
is
better
to
die
through
following
the
rules
than
to
recover
through
violating
them
in
the
same
play
desfonandres
had
previously
said
we
must
always
observe
the
formalities
of
professional
etiquette
whatever
may
happen
and
the
reason
is
given
by
tomes
his
colleague
a
dead
man
is
but
a
dead
man
but
the
of
a
formality
causes
a
notable
prejudice
to
the
whole
faculty
words
though
embodying
a
rather
different
idea
are
none
the
less
significant
mind
you
a
man
laughs
at
a
judge
in
a
morning
coat
and
yet
he
would
quake
with
dread
at
the
mere
sight
of
an
attorney
in
his
gown
all
a
matter
of
here
we
have
the
first
illustration
of
a
law
which
will
appear
with
increasing
distinctness
as
we
proceed
with
our
task
when
a
musician
strikes
a
note
on
an
instrument
other
notes
start
up
of
themselves
not
so
loud
as
the
first
yet
connected
with
it
by
certain
definite
relations
which
coalesce
with
it
and
determine
its
quality
these
are
what
are
called
in
physics
the
overtones
of
the
fundamental
note
it
would
seem
that
comic
fancy
even
in
its
most
inventions
obeys
a
similar
law
for
instance
consider
this
comic
note
appearance
seeking
to
triumph
over
reality
if
our
analysis
is
correct
this
note
must
have
as
its
overtones
the
body
tantalising
the
mind
the
body
taking
precedence
of
the
mind
no
sooner
then
does
the
comic
poet
strike
the
first
note
than
he
will
add
the
second
on
to
it
involuntarily
and
instinctively
in
other
words
he
will
duplicate
what
is
ridiculous
professionally
with
something
that
is
ridiculous
physically
when
the
judge
comes
stammering
on
to
the
stage
is
he
not
actually
preparing
us
by
this
very
stammering
to
understand
the
phenomenon
of
intellectual
ossification
we
are
about
to
witness
what
bond
of
secret
relationship
can
there
be
between
the
physical
defect
and
the
moral
infirmity
it
is
difficult
to
say
yet
we
feel
that
the
relationship
is
there
though
we
can
not
express
it
in
words
perhaps
the
situation
required
that
this
judging
machine
should
also
appear
before
us
as
a
talking
machine
however
it
may
be
no
other
overtone
could
more
perfectly
have
completed
the
fundamental
note
when
moliere
introduces
to
us
the
two
ridiculous
doctors
bahis
and
macroton
in
medecin
he
makes
one
of
them
speak
very
slowly
as
though
scanning
his
words
syllable
by
syllable
whilst
the
other
stutters
we
find
the
same
contrast
between
the
two
lawyers
in
monsieur
de
pourceaugnac
in
the
rhythm
of
speech
is
generally
to
be
found
the
physical
peculiarity
that
is
destined
to
complete
the
element
of
professional
ridicule
when
the
author
has
failed
to
suggest
a
defect
of
this
kind
it
is
seldom
the
case
that
the
actor
does
not
instinctively
invent
one
consequently
there
is
a
natural
relationship
which
we
equally
naturally
recognise
between
the
two
images
we
have
been
comparing
with
each
other
the
mind
crystallising
in
certain
grooves
and
the
body
losing
its
elasticity
through
the
influence
of
certain
defects
whether
or
not
our
attention
be
diverted
from
the
matter
to
the
manner
or
from
the
moral
to
the
physical
in
both
cases
the
same
sort
of
impression
is
conveyed
to
our
imagination
in
both
then
the
comic
is
of
the
same
kind
here
once
more
it
has
been
our
aim
to
follow
the
natural
trend
of
the
movement
of
the
imagination
this
trend
or
direction
it
may
be
remembered
was
the
second
of
those
offered
to
us
starting
from
a
central
image
a
third
and
final
path
remains
unexplored
along
which
we
will
now
proceed
let
us
then
return
for
the
last
time
to
our
central
image
something
mechanical
encrusted
on
something
living
here
the
living
being
under
discussion
was
a
human
being
a
person
a
mechanical
arrangement
on
the
other
hand
is
a
thing
what
therefore
incited
laughter
was
the
momentary
transformation
of
a
person
into
a
thing
if
one
considers
the
image
from
this
standpoint
let
us
then
pass
from
the
exact
idea
of
a
machine
to
the
vaguer
one
of
a
thing
in
general
we
shall
have
a
fresh
series
of
laughable
images
which
will
be
obtained
by
taking
a
blurred
impression
so
to
speak
of
the
outlines
of
the
former
and
will
bring
us
to
this
new
law
we
laugh
every
time
a
person
gives
us
the
impression
of
being
a
thing
we
laugh
at
sancho
panza
tumbled
into
a
and
tossed
into
the
air
like
a
football
we
laugh
at
baron
munchausen
turned
into
a
and
travelling
through
space
but
certain
tricks
of
circus
clowns
might
afford
a
still
more
precise
exemplification
of
the
same
law
true
we
should
have
to
eliminate
the
jokes
mere
interpolations
by
the
clown
into
his
main
theme
and
keep
in
mind
only
the
theme
itself
that
is
to
say
the
divers
attitudes
capers
and
movements
which
form
the
strictly
clownish
element
in
the
clown
art
on
two
occasions
only
have
i
been
able
to
observe
this
style
of
the
comic
in
its
unadulterated
state
and
in
both
i
received
the
same
impression
the
first
time
the
clowns
came
and
went
collided
fell
and
jumped
up
again
in
a
uniformly
accelerated
rhythm
visibly
intent
upon
affecting
a
crescendo
and
it
was
more
and
more
to
the
jumping
up
again
the
rebound
that
the
attention
of
the
public
was
attracted
gradually
one
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
they
were
men
of
flesh
and
blood
like
ourselves
one
began
to
think
of
bundles
of
all
sorts
falling
and
knocking
against
each
other
then
the
vision
assumed
a
more
definite
aspect
the
forms
grew
rounder
the
bodies
rolled
together
and
seemed
to
pick
themselves
up
like
balls
then
at
last
appeared
the
image
towards
which
the
whole
of
this
scene
had
doubtless
been
unconsciously
evolving
large
rubber
balls
hurled
against
one
another
in
every
direction
the
second
scene
though
even
coarser
than
the
first
was
no
less
instructive
there
came
on
the
stage
two
men
each
with
an
enormous
head
bald
as
a
billiard
ball
in
their
hands
they
carried
large
sticks
which
each
in
turn
brought
down
on
to
the
cranium
here
again
a
certain
gradation
was
observable
after
each
blow
the
bodies
seemed
to
grow
heavier
and
more
unyielding
overpowered
by
an
increasing
degree
of
rigidity
then
came
the
return
blow
in
each
case
heavier
and
more
resounding
than
the
last
coming
too
after
a
longer
interval
the
skulls
gave
forth
a
formidable
ring
throughout
the
silent
house
at
last
the
two
bodies
each
quite
rigid
and
as
straight
as
an
arrow
slowly
bent
over
towards
each
other
the
sticks
came
crashing
down
for
the
last
time
on
to
the
two
heads
with
a
thud
as
of
enormous
mallets
falling
upon
oaken
beams
and
the
pair
lay
prone
upon
the
ground
at
that
instant
appeared
in
all
its
vividness
the
suggestion
that
the
two
artists
had
gradually
driven
into
the
imagination
of
the
spectators
we
are
about
to
become
we
have
now
become
solid
wooden
dummies
a
kind
of
dim
vague
instinct
may
enable
even
an
uncultured
mind
to
get
an
inkling
here
of
the
subtler
results
of
psychological
science
we
know
that
it
is
possible
to
call
up
hallucinatory
visions
in
a
hypnotised
subject
by
simple
suggestion
if
he
be
told
that
a
bird
is
perched
on
his
hand
he
will
see
the
bird
and
watch
it
fly
away
the
idea
suggested
however
is
far
from
being
always
accepted
with
like
docility
not
infrequently
the
mesmeriser
only
succeeds
in
getting
an
idea
into
his
subject
head
by
slow
degrees
through
a
carefully
graduated
series
of
hints
he
will
then
start
with
objects
really
perceived
by
the
subject
and
will
endeavour
to
make
the
perception
of
these
objects
more
and
more
indefinite
then
step
by
step
he
will
bring
out
of
this
state
of
mental
chaos
the
precise
form
of
the
object
of
which
he
wishes
to
create
an
hallucination
something
of
the
kind
happens
to
many
people
when
dropping
off
to
sleep
they
see
those
coloured
fluid
shapeless
masses
which
occupy
the
field
of
vision
insensibly
solidifying
into
distinct
objects
consequently
the
gradual
passing
from
the
dim
and
vague
to
the
clear
and
distinct
is
the
method
of
suggestion
par
excellence
i
fancy
it
might
be
found
to
be
at
the
root
of
a
good
many
comic
suggestions
especially
in
the
coarser
forms
of
the
comic
in
which
the
transformation
of
a
person
into
a
thing
seems
to
be
taking
place
before
our
eyes
but
there
are
other
and
more
subtle
methods
in
use
among
poets
for
instance
which
perhaps
unconsciously
lead
to
the
same
end
by
a
certain
arrangement
of
rhythm
rhyme
and
assonance
it
is
possible
to
lull
the
imagination
to
rock
it
to
and
fro
between
like
and
like
with
a
regular
motion
and
thus
prepare
it
submissively
to
accept
the
vision
suggested
listen
to
these
few
lines
of
regnard
and
see
whether
something
like
the
fleeting
image
of
a
doll
does
not
cross
the
field
of
your
imagination

by
talking

persons
as

we
will
only
select
one
or
two
instances
from
the
plays
of
labiche
in
which
they
are
legion
just

phrase
that
have
occurred
though
not
exactly
transforming
the
kings
into
mere
things
likens
them
all
the
same
to
events
of
an
impersonal
nature
as
regards
this
latter
example
note
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
complete
the
identification
of
the
person
with
the
thing
in
order
to
ensure
a
comic
effect
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
start
in
this
direction
by
feigning
for
instance
to
confuse
the
person
with
the
function
he
exercises
i
will
only
quote
a
sentence
spoken
by
a
village
mayor
in
one
of
about
novels
the
prefect
who
has
always
shown
us
the
same
kindness
though
he
has
been
changed
several
times
since
all
these
witticisms
are
constructed
on
the
same
model
we
might
make
up
any
number
of
them
when
once
we
are
in
possession
of
the
recipe
but
the
art
of
the
or
the
playwright
does
not
merely
consist
in
concocting
jokes
the
difficulty
lies
in
giving
to
a
joke
its
power
of
suggestion
in
making
it
acceptable
and
we
only
do
accept
it
either
because
it
seems
to
be
the
natural
product
of
a
particular
state
of
mind
or
because
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
circumstances
of
the
case
for
instance
we
are
aware
that
perrichon
is
greatly
excited
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
railway
journey
the
expression
to
occur
is
one
that
must
have
cropped
up
a
good
many
times
in
the
lessons
repeated
by
the
girl
before
her
father
it
makes
us
think
of
such
a
repetition
lastly
admiration
of
the
governmental
machine
might
at
a
pinch
be
extended
to
the
point
of
making
us
believe
that
no
change
takes
place
in
the
prefect
when
he
changes
his
name
and
that
the
function
gets
carried
on
independently
of
the
functionary
we
have
now
reached
a
point
very
far
from
the
original
cause
of
laughter
many
a
comic
form
that
can
not
be
explained
by
itself
can
indeed
only
be
understood
from
its
resemblance
to
another
which
only
makes
us
laugh
by
reason
of
its
relationship
with
a
third
and
so
on
indefinitely
so
that
psychological
analysis
however
luminous
and
searching
will
go
astray
unless
it
holds
the
thread
along
which
the
comic
impression
has
travelled
from
one
end
of
the
series
to
the
other
where
does
this
progressive
continuity
come
from
what
can
be
the
driving
force
the
strange
impulse
which
causes
the
comic
to
glide
thus
from
image
to
image
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
until
it
is
broken
up
and
lost
in
infinitely
remote
analogies
but
what
is
that
force
which
divides
and
subdivides
the
branches
of
a
tree
into
smaller
boughs
and
its
roots
into
radicles
an
inexorable
law
dooms
every
living
energy
during
the
brief
interval
allotted
to
it
in
time
to
cover
the
widest
possible
extent
in
space
now
comic
fancy
is
indeed
a
living
energy
a
strange
plant
that
has
nourished
on
the
stony
portions
of
the
social
soil
until
such
time
as
culture
should
allow
it
to
vie
with
the
most
refined
products
of
art
true
we
are
far
from
great
art
in
the
examples
of
the
comic
we
have
just
been
reviewing
but
we
shall
draw
nearer
to
it
though
without
attaining
to
it
completely
in
the
following
chapter
below
art
we
find
artifice
and
it
is
this
zone
of
artifice
midway
between
nature
and
art
that
we
are
now
about
to
enter
we
are
going
to
deal
with
the
comic
playwright
and
the
wit
chapter
ii
the
comic
element
in
situations
and
the
comic
element
in
words
i
we
have
studied
the
comic
element
in
forms
in
attitudes
and
in
movements
generally
now
let
us
look
for
it
in
actions
and
in
situations
we
encounter
indeed
this
kind
of
comic
readily
enough
in
everyday
life
it
is
not
here
however
that
it
best
lends
itself
to
analysis
assuming
that
the
stage
is
both
a
magnified
and
a
simplified
view
of
life
we
shall
find
that
comedy
is
capable
of
furnishing
us
with
more
information
than
real
life
on
this
particular
part
of
our
subject
perhaps
we
ought
even
to
carry
simplification
still
farther
and
going
back
to
our
earliest
recollections
try
to
discover
in
the
games
that
amused
us
as
children
the
first
faint
traces
of
the
combinations
that
make
us
laugh
as
persons
we
are
too
apt
to
speak
of
our
feelings
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
as
though
full
grown
at
birth
as
though
each
one
of
them
had
not
a
history
of
its
own
above
all
we
are
too
apt
to
ignore
the
childish
element
so
to
speak
latent
in
most
of
our
joyful
emotions
and
yet
how
many
of
our
present
pleasures
were
we
to
examine
them
closely
would
shrink
into
nothing
more
than
memories
of
past
ones
what
would
there
be
left
of
many
of
our
emotions
were
we
to
reduce
them
to
the
exact
quantum
of
pure
feeling
they
contain
by
subtracting
from
them
all
that
is
merely
reminiscence
indeed
it
seems
possible
that
after
a
certain
age
we
become
impervious
to
all
fresh
or
novel
forms
of
joy
and
the
sweetest
pleasures
of
the
man
are
perhaps
nothing
more
than
a
revival
of
the
sensations
of
childhood
a
balmy
zephyr
wafted
in
fainter
and
fainter
breaths
by
a
past
that
is
ever
receding
in
any
case
whatever
reply
we
give
to
this
broad
question
one
thing
is
certain
there
can
be
no
break
in
continuity
between
the
delight
in
games
and
that
of
the
person
now
comedy
is
a
game
a
game
that
imitates
life
and
since
in
the
games
of
the
child
when
working
its
dolls
and
puppets
many
of
the
movements
are
produced
by
strings
ought
we
not
to
find
those
same
strings
somewhat
frayed
by
wear
reappearing
as
the
threads
that
knot
together
the
situations
in
a
comedy
let
us
then
start
with
the
games
of
a
child
and
follow
the
imperceptible
process
by
which
as
he
grows
himself
he
makes
his
puppets
grow
inspires
them
with
life
and
finally
brings
them
to
an
ambiguous
state
in
which
without
ceasing
to
be
puppets
they
have
yet
become
human
beings
we
thus
obtain
characters
of
a
comedy
type
and
upon
them
we
can
test
the
truth
of
the
law
of
which
all
our
preceding
analyses
gave
an
inkling
a
law
in
accordance
with
which
we
will
define
all
broadly
comic
situations
in
general
any
arrangement
of
acts
and
events
is
comic
which
gives
us
in
a
single
combination
the
illusion
of
life
and
the
distinct
impression
of
a
mechanical
arrangement
the
as
children
we
have
all
played
with
the
little
man
who
springs
out
of
his
box
you
squeeze
him
flat
he
jumps
up
again
push
him
lower
and
he
shoots
up
still
higher
crush
him
down
beneath
the
lid
and
often
he
will
send
everything
flying
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
or
no
the
toy
itself
is
very
ancient
but
the
kind
of
amusement
it
affords
belongs
to
all
time
it
is
a
struggle
between
two
stubborn
elements
one
of
which
being
simply
mechanical
generally
ends
by
giving
in
to
the
other
which
treats
it
as
a
plaything
a
cat
playing
with
a
mouse
which
from
time
to
time
she
releases
like
a
spring
only
to
pull
it
up
short
with
a
stroke
of
her
paw
indulges
in
the
same
kind
of
amusement
we
will
now
pass
on
to
the
theatre
beginning
with
a
punch
and
judy
show
no
sooner
does
the
policeman
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
stage
than
naturally
enough
he
receives
a
blow
which
fells
him
he
springs
to
his
feet
a
second
blow
lays
him
flat
a
repetition
of
the
offence
is
followed
by
a
repetition
of
the
punishment
up
and
down
the
constable
flops
and
hops
with
the
uniform
rhythm
of
the
bending
and
release
of
a
spring
whilst
the
spectators
laugh
louder
and
louder
now
let
us
think
of
a
spring
that
is
rather
of
a
moral
type
an
idea
that
is
first
expressed
then
repressed
and
then
expressed
again
a
stream
of
words
that
bursts
forth
is
checked
and
keeps
on
starting
afresh
once
more
we
have
the
vision
of
one
stubborn
force
counteracted
by
another
equally
pertinacious
this
vision
however
will
have
discarded
a
portion
of
its
materiality
no
longer
is
it
punch
and
judy
that
we
are
watching
but
rather
a
real
comedy
many
a
comic
scene
may
indeed
be
referred
to
this
simple
type
for
instance
in
the
scene
of
the
mariage
force
between
sganarelle
and
pancrace
the
entire
vis
comica
lies
in
the
conflict
set
up
between
the
idea
of
sganarelle
who
wishes
to
make
the
philosopher
listen
to
him
and
the
obstinacy
of
the
philosopher
a
regular
working
automatically
as
the
scene
progresses
the
image
of
the
becomes
more
apparent
so
that
at
last
the
characters
themselves
adopt
its
movements
sganarelle
pushing
pancrace
each
time
he
shows
himself
back
into
the
wings
pancrace
returning
to
the
stage
after
each
repulse
to
continue
his
patter
and
when
sganarelle
finally
drives
pancrace
back
and
shuts
him
up
inside
the
house
inside
the
box
one
is
tempted
to
say
a
window
suddenly
flies
open
and
the
head
of
the
philosopher
again
appears
as
though
it
had
burst
open
the
lid
of
a
box
the
same
occurs
in
the
malade
imaginaire
through
the
mouth
of
monsieur
purgon
the
outraged
medical
profession
pours
out
its
vials
of
wrath
upon
argan
threatening
him
with
every
disease
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
every
time
argan
rises
from
his
seat
as
though
to
silence
purgon
the
latter
disappears
for
a
moment
being
as
it
were
thrust
back
into
the
wings
then
as
though
impelled
by
a
spring
he
rebounds
on
to
the
stage
with
a
fresh
curse
on
his
lips
the
exclamation
monsieur
purgon
recurs
at
regular
beats
and
as
it
were
marks
the
tempo
of
this
little
scene
let
us
scrutinise
more
closely
the
image
of
the
spring
which
is
bent
released
and
bent
again
let
us
disentangle
its
central
element
and
we
shall
hit
upon
one
of
the
usual
processes
of
classic
comedy
repetition
why
is
it
there
is
something
comic
in
the
repetition
of
a
word
on
the
stage
no
theory
of
the
ludicrous
seems
to
offer
a
satisfactory
answer
to
this
very
simple
question
nor
can
an
answer
be
found
so
long
as
we
look
for
the
explanation
of
an
amusing
word
or
phrase
in
the
phrase
or
word
itself
apart
from
all
it
suggests
to
us
nowhere
will
the
usual
method
prove
to
be
so
inadequate
as
here
with
the
exception
however
of
a
few
special
instances
to
which
we
shall
recur
later
the
repetition
of
a
word
is
never
laughable
in
itself
it
makes
us
laugh
only
because
it
symbolises
a
special
play
of
moral
elements
this
play
itself
being
the
symbol
of
an
altogether
material
diversion
it
is
the
diversion
of
the
cat
with
the
mouse
the
diversion
of
the
child
pushing
back
the
time
after
time
to
the
bottom
of
his
box
but
in
a
refined
and
spiritualised
form
transferred
to
the
realm
of
feelings
and
ideas
let
us
then
state
the
law
which
we
think
defines
the
main
comic
varieties
of
on
the
stage
in
a
comic
repetition
of
words
we
generally
find
two
terms
a
repressed
feeling
which
goes
off
like
a
spring
and
an
idea
that
delights
in
repressing
the
feeling
anew
when
dorine
is
telling
orgon
of
his
wife
illness
and
the
latter
continually
interrupts
him
with
inquiries
as
to
the
health
of
tartuffe
the
question
et
tartuffe
repeated
every
few
moments
affords
us
the
distinct
sensation
of
a
spring
being
released
this
spring
dorine
delights
in
pushing
back
each
time
she
resumes
her
account
of
illness
and
when
scapin
informs
old
geronte
that
his
son
has
been
taken
prisoner
on
the
famous
galley
and
that
a
ransom
must
be
paid
without
delay
he
is
playing
with
the
avarice
of
geronte
exactly
as
dorine
does
with
the
infatuation
of
orgon
the
old
man
avarice
is
no
sooner
repressed
than
up
it
springs
again
automatically
and
it
is
this
automatism
that
moliere
tries
to
indicate
by
the
mechanical
repetition
of
a
sentence
expressing
regret
at
the
money
that
would
have
to
be
forthcoming
what
the
deuce
did
he
want
in
that
galley
the
same
criticism
is
applicable
to
the
scene
in
which
valere
points
out
to
harpagon
the
wrong
he
would
be
doing
in
marrying
his
daughter
to
a
man
she
did
not
love
no
dowry
wanted
interrupts
the
miserly
harpagon
every
few
moments
behind
this
exclamation
which
recurs
automatically
we
faintly
discern
a
complete
set
going
by
a
fixed
idea
at
times
this
mechanism
is
less
easy
to
detect
and
here
we
encounter
a
fresh
difficulty
in
the
theory
of
the
comic
sometimes
the
whole
interest
of
a
scene
lies
in
one
character
playing
a
double
part
the
intervening
speaker
acting
as
a
mere
prism
so
to
speak
through
which
the
dual
personality
is
developed
we
run
the
risk
then
of
going
astray
if
we
look
for
the
secret
of
the
effect
in
what
we
see
and
hear
in
the
external
scene
played
by
the
characters
and
not
in
the
altogether
inner
comedy
of
which
this
scene
is
no
more
than
the
outer
refraction
for
instance
when
alceste
stubbornly
repeats
the
words
i
do
say
that
on
oronte
asking
him
if
he
thinks
his
poetry
bad
the
repetition
is
laughable
though
evidently
oronte
is
not
now
playing
with
alceste
at
the
game
we
have
just
described
we
must
be
careful
however
for
in
reality
we
have
two
men
in
alceste
on
the
one
hand
the
misanthropist
who
has
vowed
henceforth
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
on
the
other
the
gentleman
who
can
not
unlearn
in
a
trice
the
usual
forms
of
politeness
or
even
it
may
be
just
the
honest
fellow
who
when
called
upon
to
put
his
words
into
practice
shrinks
from
wounding
another
or
hurting
his
feelings
accordingly
the
real
scene
is
not
between
alceste
and
oronte
it
is
between
alceste
and
himself
the
one
alceste
would
fain
blurt
out
the
truth
and
the
other
stops
his
mouth
just
as
he
is
on
the
point
of
telling
everything
each
i
do
say
that
reveals
a
growing
effort
to
repress
something
that
strives
and
struggles
to
get
out
and
so
the
tone
in
which
the
phrase
is
uttered
gets
more
and
more
violent
alceste
becoming
more
and
more
angry
not
with
oronte
as
he
thinks
but
with
himself
the
tension
of
the
spring
is
continually
being
renewed
and
reinforced
until
it
at
last
goes
off
with
a
bang
here
as
elsewhere
we
have
the
same
identical
mechanism
of
repetition
for
a
man
to
make
a
resolution
never
henceforth
to
say
what
he
does
not
think
even
though
he
openly
defy
the
whole
human
race
is
not
necessarily
laughable
it
is
only
a
phase
of
life
at
its
highest
and
best
for
another
man
through
amiability
selfishness
or
disdain
to
prefer
to
flatter
people
is
only
another
phase
of
life
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
make
us
laugh
you
may
even
combine
these
two
men
into
one
and
arrange
that
the
individual
waver
between
offensive
frankness
and
delusive
politeness
this
duel
between
two
opposing
feelings
will
not
even
then
be
comic
rather
it
will
appear
the
essence
of
seriousness
if
these
two
feelings
through
their
very
distinctness
complete
each
other
develop
side
by
side
and
make
up
between
them
a
composite
mental
condition
adopting
in
short
a
modus
vivendi
which
merely
gives
us
the
complex
impression
of
life
but
imagine
these
two
feelings
as
inelastic
and
unvarying
elements
in
a
really
living
man
make
him
oscillate
from
one
to
the
other
above
all
arrange
that
this
oscillation
becomes
entirely
mechanical
by
adopting
the
form
of
some
habitual
simple
childish
contrivance
then
you
will
get
the
image
we
have
so
far
found
in
all
laughable
objects
something
mechanical
in
something
living
in
fact
something
comic
we
have
dwelt
on
this
first
image
the
sufficiently
to
show
how
comic
fancy
gradually
converts
a
material
mechanism
into
a
moral
one
now
we
will
consider
one
or
two
other
games
confining
ourselves
to
their
most
striking
aspects
the
there
are
innumerable
comedies
in
which
one
of
the
characters
thinks
he
is
speaking
and
acting
freely
and
consequently
retains
all
the
essentials
of
life
whereas
viewed
from
a
certain
standpoint
he
appears
as
a
mere
toy
in
the
hands
of
another
who
is
playing
with
him
the
transition
is
easily
made
from
the
which
a
child
works
with
a
string
to
geronte
and
argante
manipulated
by
scapin
listen
to
scapin
himself
the
machine
is
all
there
and
again
providence
has
brought
them
into
my
net
etc
instinctively
and
because
one
would
rather
be
a
cheat
than
be
cheated
in
imagination
at
all
events
the
spectator
sides
with
the
knaves
and
for
the
rest
of
the
time
like
a
child
who
has
persuaded
his
playmate
to
lend
him
his
doll
he
takes
hold
of
the
strings
himself
and
makes
the
marionette
come
and
go
on
the
stage
as
he
pleases
but
this
latter
condition
is
not
indispensable
we
can
remain
outside
the
pale
of
what
is
taking
place
if
only
we
retain
the
distinct
impression
of
a
mechanical
arrangement
this
is
what
happens
whenever
one
of
the
characters
vacillates
between
two
contrary
opinions
each
in
turn
appealing
to
him
as
when
panurge
asks
tom
dick
and
harry
whether
or
no
he
ought
to
get
married
note
that
in
such
a
case
a
comic
author
is
always
careful
to
personify
the
two
opposing
decisions
for
if
there
is
no
spectator
there
must
at
all
events
be
actors
to
hold
the
strings
all
that
is
serious
in
life
comes
from
our
freedom
the
feelings
we
have
matured
the
passions
we
have
brooded
over
the
actions
we
have
weighed
decided
upon
and
carried
through
in
short
all
that
comes
from
us
and
is
our
very
own
these
are
the
things
that
give
life
its
ofttimes
dramatic
and
generally
grave
aspect
what
then
is
requisite
to
transform
all
this
into
a
comedy
merely
to
fancy
that
our
seeming
freedom
conceals
the
strings
of
a
and
that
we
are
as
the
poet
says
humble
marionettes
the
wires
of
which
are
pulled
by
fate
footnote
marionnettes
dont
le
fil
est
aux
mains
de
la
necessite
so
there
is
not
a
real
a
serious
or
even
a
dramatic
scene
that
fancy
can
not
render
comic
by
simply
calling
forth
this
image
nor
is
there
a
game
for
which
a
wider
field
lies
open
the
the
farther
we
proceed
in
this
investigation
into
the
methods
of
comedy
the
more
clearly
we
see
the
part
played
by
childhood
memories
these
memories
refer
perhaps
less
to
any
special
game
than
to
the
mechanical
device
of
which
that
game
is
a
particular
instance
the
same
general
device
moreover
may
be
met
with
in
widely
different
games
just
as
the
same
operatic
air
is
found
in
many
different
arrangements
and
variations
what
is
here
of
importance
and
is
retained
in
the
mind
what
passes
by
imperceptible
stages
from
the
games
of
a
child
to
those
of
a
man
is
the
mental
diagram
the
skeleton
outline
of
the
combination
or
if
you
like
the
abstract
formula
of
which
these
games
are
particular
illustrations
take
for
instance
the
rolling
which
increases
in
size
as
it
moves
along
we
might
just
as
well
think
of
toy
soldiers
standing
behind
one
another
push
the
first
and
it
tumbles
down
on
the
second
this
latter
knocks
down
the
third
and
the
state
of
things
goes
from
bad
to
worse
until
they
all
lie
prone
on
the
floor
or
again
take
a
house
of
cards
that
has
been
built
up
with
infinite
care
the
first
you
touch
seems
uncertain
whether
to
move
or
not
its
tottering
neighbour
comes
to
a
quicker
decision
and
the
work
of
destruction
gathering
momentum
as
it
goes
on
rushes
headlong
to
the
final
collapse
these
instances
are
all
different
but
they
suggest
the
same
abstract
vision
that
of
an
effect
which
grows
by
arithmetical
progression
so
that
the
cause
insignificant
at
the
outset
culminates
by
a
necessary
evolution
in
a
result
as
important
as
it
is
unexpected
now
let
us
open
a
children
we
shall
find
this
arrangement
already
on
the
high
road
to
becoming
comic
here
for
instance
in
one
of
the
comic
picked
up
by
chance
we
have
a
caller
rushing
violently
into
a
he
knocks
against
a
lady
who
upsets
her
cup
of
tea
over
an
old
gentleman
who
slips
against
a
glass
window
which
falls
in
the
street
on
to
the
head
of
a
constable
who
sets
the
whole
police
force
agog
etc
the
same
arrangement
reappears
in
many
a
picture
intended
for
grownup
persons
in
the
stories
without
words
sketched
by
humorous
artists
we
are
often
shown
an
object
which
moves
from
place
to
place
and
persons
who
are
closely
connected
with
it
so
that
through
a
series
of
scenes
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
object
mechanically
brings
about
increasingly
serious
changes
in
the
situation
of
the
persons
let
us
now
turn
to
comedy
many
a
droll
scene
many
a
comedy
even
may
be
referred
to
this
simple
type
read
the
speech
of
chicanneau
in
the
plaideurs
here
we
find
lawsuits
within
lawsuits
and
the
mechanism
works
faster
and
faster
racine
produces
in
us
this
feeling
of
increasing
acceleration
by
crowding
his
law
terms
ever
closer
together
until
the
lawsuit
over
a
truss
of
hay
costs
the
plaintiff
the
best
part
of
his
fortune
and
again
the
same
arrangement
occurs
in
certain
scenes
of
don
quixote
for
instance
in
the
inn
scene
where
by
an
extraordinary
concatenation
of
circumstances
the
strikes
sancho
who
belabours
maritornes
upon
whom
the
innkeeper
falls
etc
finally
let
us
pass
to
the
light
comedy
of
need
we
call
to
mind
all
the
forms
in
which
this
same
combination
appears
there
is
one
that
is
employed
rather
frequently
for
instance
a
certain
thing
say
a
letter
happens
to
be
of
supreme
importance
to
a
certain
person
and
must
be
recovered
at
all
costs
this
thing
which
always
vanishes
just
when
you
think
you
have
caught
it
pervades
the
entire
play
rolling
up
increasingly
serious
and
unexpected
incidents
as
it
proceeds
all
this
is
far
more
like
a
child
game
than
appears
at
first
blush
once
more
the
effect
produced
is
that
of
the
snowball
it
is
the
characteristic
of
a
mechanical
combination
to
be
generally
reversible
a
child
is
delighted
when
he
sees
the
ball
in
a
game
of
ninepins
knocking
down
everything
in
its
way
and
spreading
havoc
in
all
directions
he
laughs
louder
than
ever
when
the
ball
returns
to
its
after
twists
and
turns
and
waverings
of
every
kind
in
other
words
the
mechanism
just
described
is
laughable
even
when
rectilinear
it
is
much
more
so
on
becoming
circular
and
when
every
effort
the
player
makes
by
a
fatal
interaction
of
cause
and
effect
merely
results
in
bringing
it
back
to
the
same
spot
now
a
considerable
number
of
light
comedies
revolve
round
this
idea
an
italian
straw
hat
has
been
eaten
up
by
a
horse

there
is
only
one
other

be
secured
regardless
of
cost
this
hat
which
always
slips
away
at
the
moment
its
capture
seems
inevitable
keeps
the
principal
character
on
the
run
and
through
him
all
the
others
who
hang
so
to
say
on
to
his
coat
tails
like
a

which
by
a
successive

draws
along
in

that
hang
on
to

when
at
last
after
all
sorts
of

the
goal
seems
in

it
is
found
that
the
hat
so
ardently
sought
is
precisely
the
one
that
has
been
eaten
the

voyage
of
discovery
is
depicted
in
another

comedy

brings
back

him
his
former

in
the
aggravated
form
of
a
second
when
we
think
how
intense
and
how
common
is
this
type
of
the
comic
we
understand
why
it
has
fascinated
the
imagination
of
certain
philosophers
to
cover
a
good
deal
of
ground
only
to
come
back
unwittingly
to
the
is
to
make
a
great
effort
for
a
result
that
is
nil
so
we
might
be
tempted
to
define
the
comic
in
this
latter
fashion
and
such
indeed
seems
to
be
the
idea
of
herbert
spencer
according
to
him
laughter
is
the
indication
of
an
effort
which
suddenly
encounters
a
void
kant
had
already
said
something
of
the
kind
laughter
is
the
result
of
an
expectation
which
of
a
sudden
ends
in
nothing
no
doubt
these
definitions
would
apply
to
the
last
few
examples
given
although
even
then
the
formula
needs
the
addition
of
sundry
limitations
for
we
often
make
an
ineffectual
effort
which
is
in
no
way
provocative
of
laughter
while
however
the
last
few
examples
are
illustrations
of
a
great
cause
resulting
in
a
small
effect
we
quoted
others
immediately
before
which
might
be
defined
inversely
as
a
great
effect
springing
from
a
small
cause
the
truth
is
this
second
definition
has
scarcely
more
validity
than
the
first
lack
of
proportion
between
cause
and
effect
whether
appearing
in
one
or
in
the
other
is
never
the
direct
source
of
laughter
what
we
do
laugh
at
is
something
that
this
lack
of
proportion
may
in
certain
cases
disclose
namely
a
particular
mechanical
arrangement
which
it
reveals
to
us
as
through
a
glass
at
the
back
of
the
series
of
effects
and
causes
disregard
this
arrangement
and
you
let
go
the
only
clue
capable
of
guiding
you
through
the
labyrinth
of
the
comic
any
hypothesis
you
otherwise
would
select
while
possibly
applicable
to
a
few
carefully
chosen
cases
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
met
and
overthrown
by
the
first
unsuitable
instance
that
comes
along
but
why
is
it
we
laugh
at
this
mechanical
arrangement
it
is
doubtless
strange
that
the
history
of
a
person
or
of
a
group
should
sometimes
appear
like
a
game
worked
by
strings
or
gearings
or
springs
but
from
what
source
does
the
special
character
of
this
strangeness
arise
what
is
it
that
makes
it
laughable
to
this
question
which
we
have
already
propounded
in
various
forms
our
answer
must
always
be
the
same
the
rigid
mechanism
which
we
occasionally
detect
as
a
foreign
body
in
the
living
continuity
of
human
affairs
is
of
peculiar
interest
to
us
as
being
a
kind
of
absentmindedness
on
the
part
of
life
were
events
unceasingly
mindful
of
their
own
course
there
would
be
no
coincidences
no
conjunctures
and
no
circular
series
everything
would
evolve
and
progress
continuously
and
were
all
men
always
attentive
to
life
were
we
constantly
keeping
in
touch
with
others
as
well
as
with
ourselves
nothing
within
us
would
ever
appear
as
due
to
the
working
of
strings
or
springs
the
comic
is
that
side
of
a
person
which
reveals
his
likeness
to
a
thing
that
aspect
of
human
events
which
through
its
peculiar
inelasticity
conveys
the
impression
of
pure
mechanism
of
automatism
of
movement
without
life
consequently
it
expresses
an
individual
or
collective
imperfection
which
calls
for
an
immediate
corrective
this
corrective
is
laughter
a
social
gesture
that
singles
out
and
represses
a
special
kind
of
absentmindedness
in
men
and
in
events
but
this
in
turn
tempts
us
to
make
further
investigations
so
far
we
have
spent
our
time
in
rediscovering
in
the
diversions
of
the
grownup
man
those
mechanical
combinations
which
amused
him
as
a
child
our
methods
in
fact
have
been
entirely
empirical
let
us
now
attempt
to
frame
a
full
and
methodical
theory
by
seeking
as
it
were
at
the
fountainhead
the
changeless
and
simple
archetypes
of
the
manifold
and
transient
practices
of
the
comic
stage
comedy
we
said
combines
events
so
as
to
introduce
mechanism
into
the
outer
forms
of
life
let
us
now
ascertain
in
what
essential
characteristics
life
when
viewed
from
without
seems
to
contrast
with
mere
mechanism
we
shall
only
have
then
to
turn
to
the
opposite
characteristics
in
order
to
discover
the
abstract
formula
this
time
a
general
and
complete
one
for
every
real
and
possible
method
of
comedy
life
presents
itself
to
us
as
evolution
in
time
and
complexity
in
space
regarded
in
time
it
is
the
continuous
evolution
of
a
being
ever
growing
older
it
never
goes
backwards
and
never
repeats
anything
considered
in
space
it
exhibits
certain
coexisting
elements
so
closely
interdependent
so
exclusively
made
for
one
another
that
not
one
of
them
could
at
the
same
time
belong
to
two
different
organisms
each
living
being
is
a
closed
system
of
phenomena
incapable
of
interfering
with
other
systems
a
continual
change
of
aspect
the
irreversibility
of
the
order
of
phenomena
the
perfect
individuality
of
a
perfectly
series
such
then
are
the
outward
characteristics
whether
real
or
apparent
is
of
little
moment
which
distinguish
the
living
from
the
merely
mechanical
let
us
take
the
counterpart
of
each
of
these
we
shall
obtain
three
processes
which
might
be
called
repetition
inversion
and
reciprocal
interference
of
series
now
it
is
easy
to
see
that
these
are
also
the
methods
of
light
comedy
and
that
no
others
are
possible
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
could
discover
them
as
ingredients
of
varying
importance
in
the
composition
of
all
the
scenes
we
have
just
been
considering
and
a
fortiori
in
the
children
games
the
mechanism
of
which
they
reproduce
the
requisite
analysis
would
however
delay
us
too
long
and
it
is
more
profitable
to
study
them
in
their
purity
by
taking
fresh
examples
nothing
could
be
easier
for
it
is
in
their
pure
state
that
they
are
found
both
in
classic
comedy
and
in
contemporary
plays
present
problem
no
longer
deals
like
the
preceding
one
with
a
word
or
a
sentence
repeated
by
an
individual
but
rather
with
a
situation
that
is
a
combination
of
circumstances
which
recurs
several
times
in
its
original
form
and
thus
contrasts
with
the
changing
stream
of
life
everyday
experience
supplies
us
with
this
type
of
the
comic
though
only
in
a
rudimentary
state
thus
you
meet
a
friend
in
the
street
whom
you
have
not
seen
for
an
age
there
is
nothing
comic
in
the
situation
if
however
you
meet
him
again
the
same
day
and
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
you
may
laugh
at
the
coincidence
now
picture
to
yourself
a
series
of
imaginary
events
which
affords
a
tolerably
fair
illusion
of
life
and
within
this
series
imagine
one
and
the
same
scene
reproduced
either
by
the
same
characters
or
by
different
ones
again
you
will
have
a
coincidence
though
a
far
more
extraordinary
one
such
are
the
repetitions
produced
on
the
stage
they
are
the
more
laughable
in
proportion
as
the
scene
repeated
is
more
complex
and
more
naturally
introduced
two
conditions
which
seem
mutually
exclusive
and
which
the
must
be
clever
enough
to
reconcile
contemporary
light
comedy
employs
this
method
in
every
shape
and
form
one
of
the
examples
consists
in
bringing
a
group
of
characters
act
after
act
into
the
most
varied
surroundings
so
as
to
reproduce
under
ever
fresh
circumstances
one
and
the
same
series
of
incidents
or
accidents
more
or
less
symmetrically
identical
in
several
of
moliere
plays
we
find
one
and
the
same
arrangement
of
events
repeated
right
through
the
comedy
from
beginning
to
end
thus
the
ecole
des
femmes
does
nothing
more
than
reproduce
and
repeat
a
single
incident
in
three
tempi
first
tempo
horace
tells
arnolphe
of
the
plan
he
has
devised
to
deceive
agnes
guardian
who
turns
out
to
be
arnolphe
himself
second
tempo
arnolphe
thinks
he
has
checkmated
the
move
third
tempo
agnes
contrives
that
horace
gets
all
the
benefit
of
arnolphe
precautionary
measures
there
is
the
same
symmetrical
repetition
in
the
ecole
des
marts
in
and
above
all
in
george
dandin
where
the
same
effect
in
three
tempi
is
again
met
with
first
tempo
george
dandin
discovers
that
his
wife
is
unfaithful
second
tempo
he
summons
his
father
and
to
his
assistance
third
tempo
it
is
george
dandin
himself
after
all
who
has
to
apologise
at
times
the
same
scene
is
reproduced
with
groups
of
different
characters
then
it
not
infrequently
happens
that
the
first
group
consists
of
masters
and
the
second
of
servants
the
latter
repeat
in
another
key
a
scene
already
played
by
the
former
though
the
rendering
is
naturally
less
refined
a
part
of
the
depit
amoureux
is
constructed
on
this
plan
as
is
also
amphitryon
in
an
amusing
little
comedy
of
benedix
der
eigensinn
the
order
is
inverted
we
have
the
masters
reproducing
a
scene
of
stubbornness
in
which
their
servants
have
set
the
example
but
quite
irrespective
of
the
characters
who
serve
as
pegs
for
the
arrangement
of
symmetrical
situations
there
seems
to
be
a
wide
gulf
between
classic
comedy
and
the
theatre
of
both
aim
at
introducing
a
certain
mathematical
order
into
events
while
none
the
less
maintaining
their
aspect
of
likelihood
that
is
to
say
of
life
but
the
means
they
employ
are
different
the
majority
of
light
comedies
of
our
day
seek
to
mesmerise
directly
the
mind
of
the
spectator
for
however
extraordinary
the
coincidence
it
becomes
acceptable
from
the
very
fact
that
it
is
accepted
and
we
do
accept
it
if
we
have
been
gradually
prepared
for
its
reception
such
is
often
the
procedure
adopted
by
contemporary
authors
in
moliere
plays
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
moods
of
the
persons
on
the
stage
not
of
the
audience
that
make
repetition
seem
natural
each
of
the
characters
represents
a
certain
force
applied
in
a
certain
direction
and
it
is
because
these
forces
constant
in
direction
necessarily
combine
together
in
the
same
way
that
the
same
situation
is
reproduced
thus
interpreted
the
comedy
of
situation
is
akin
to
the
comedy
of
character
it
deserves
to
be
called
classic
if
classic
art
is
indeed
that
which
does
not
claim
to
derive
from
the
effect
more
than
it
has
put
into
the
cause
this
second
method
has
so
much
analogy
with
the
first
that
we
will
merely
define
it
without
insisting
on
illustrations
picture
to
yourself
certain
characters
in
a
certain
situation
if
you
reverse
the
situation
and
invert
the
roles
you
obtain
a
comic
scene
the
double
rescue
scene
in
le
voyage
de
perrichon
belongs
to
this
class
footnote

le
voyage
de

there
is
no
necessity
however
for
both
the
identical
scenes
to
be
played
before
us
we
may
be
shown
only
one
provided
the
other
is
really
in
our
minds
thus

laugh

its

modern
literature
we
meet
with
hundreds
of
variations
on
the
theme
of
the
robber
robbed
in
every
case
the
root
idea
involves
an
inversion
of
roles
and
a
situation
which
recoils
on
the
head
of
its
author
here
we
apparently
find
the
confirmation
of
a
law
some
illustrations
of
which
we
have
already
pointed
out
when
a
comic
scene
has
been
reproduced
a
number
of
times
it
reaches
the
stage
of
being
a
classical
type
or
model
it
becomes
amusing
in
itself
quite
apart
from
the
causes
which
render
it
amusing
henceforth
new
scenes
which
are
not
comic
de
jure
may
become
amusing
de
facto
on
account
of
their
partial
resemblance
to
this
model
they
call
up
in
our
mind
a
more
or
less
confused
image
which
we
know
to
be
comical
they
range
themselves
in
a
category
representing
an
officially
recognised
type
of
the
comic
the
scene
of
the
robber
robbed
belongs
to
this
class
it
casts
over
a
host
of
other
scenes
a
reflection
of
the
comic
element
it
contains
in
the
end
it
renders
comic
any
mishap
that
befalls
one
through
one
own
fault
no
matter
what
the
fault
or
mishap
may
be
nay
an
allusion
to
this
mishap
a
single
word
that
recalls
it
is
sufficient
there
would
be
nothing
amusing
in
the
saying
it
serves
you
right
george
dandin
were
it
not
for
the
comic
overtones
that
take
up
and
it
we
have
dwelt
at
considerable
length
on
repetition
and
inversion
we
now
come
to
the
reciprocal
interference
footnote
the
word
interference
has
here
the
meaning
given
to
it
in
optics
where
it
indicates
the
partial
superposition
and
neutralisation
by
each
other
of
two
series
of
of
series
this
is
a
comic
effect
the
precise
formula
of
which
is
very
difficult
to
disentangle
by
reason
of
the
extraordinary
variety
of
forms
in
which
it
appears
on
the
stage
perhaps
it
might
be
defined
as
follows
a
situation
is
invariably
comic
when
it
belongs
simultaneously
to
two
altogether
independent
series
of
events
and
is
capable
of
being
interpreted
in
two
entirely
different
meanings
at
the
same
time
you
will
at
once
think
of
an
equivocal
situation
and
the
equivocal
situation
is
indeed
one
which
permits
of
two
different
meanings
at
the
same
time
the
one
merely
plausible
which
is
put
forward
by
the
actors
the
other
a
real
one
which
is
given
by
the
public
we
see
the
real
meaning
of
the
situation
because
care
has
been
taken
to
show
us
every
aspect
of
it
but
each
of
the
actors
knows
only
one
of
these
aspects
hence
the
mistakes
they
make
and
the
erroneous
judgments
they
pass
both
on
what
is
going
on
around
them
and
on
what
they
are
doing
themselves
we
proceed
from
this
erroneous
judgment
to
the
correct
one
we
waver
between
the
possible
meaning
and
the
real
and
it
is
this
mental
seesaw
between
two
contrary
interpretations
which
is
at
first
apparent
in
the
enjoyment
we
derive
from
an
equivocal
situation
it
is
natural
that
certain
philosophers
should
have
been
specially
struck
by
this
mental
instability
and
that
some
of
them
should
regard
the
very
essence
of
the
ludicrous
as
consisting
in
the
collision
or
coincidence
of
two
judgments
that
contradict
each
other
their
definition
however
is
far
from
meeting
every
case
and
even
when
it
does
it
defines
not
the
principle
of
the
ludicrous
but
only
one
of
its
more
or
less
distant
consequences
indeed
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
misunderstanding
is
nothing
but
a
particular
instance
of
a
far
more
general
phenomenon
the
reciprocal
interference
of
independent
series
and
that
moreover
it
is
not
laughable
in
itself
but
only
as
a
sign
of
such
an
interference
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
of
the
characters
in
every
misunderstanding
has
his
setting
in
an
appropriate
series
of
events
which
he
correctly
interprets
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
and
which
give
the
to
his
words
and
actions
each
of
the
series
peculiar
to
the
several
characters
develop
independently
but
at
a
certain
moment
they
meet
under
such
conditions
that
the
actions
and
words
that
belong
to
one
might
just
as
well
belong
to
another
hence
arise
the
misunderstandings
and
the
equivocal
nature
of
the
situation
but
this
latter
is
not
laughable
in
itself
it
is
so
only
because
it
reveals
the
coincidence
of
the
two
independent
series
the
proof
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
author
must
be
continually
taxing
his
ingenuity
to
recall
our
attention
to
the
double
fact
of
independence
and
coincidence
this
he
generally
succeeds
in
doing
by
constantly
renewing
the
vain
threat
of
dissolving
partnership
between
the
two
coinciding
series
every
moment
the
whole
thing
threatens
to
break
down
but
manages
to
get
patched
up
again
it
is
this
diversion
that
excites
laughter
far
more
than
the
oscillation
of
the
mind
between
two
contradictory
ideas
it
makes
us
laugh
because
it
reveals
to
us
the
reciprocal
interference
of
two
independent
series
the
real
source
of
the
comic
effect
and
so
the
misunderstanding
is
nothing
more
than
one
particular
instance
one
means
perhaps
the
most
artificial
of
illustrating
the
reciprocal
interference
of
series
but
it
is
not
the
only
one
instead
of
two
contemporary
series
you
might
take
one
series
of
events
belonging
to
the
past
and
another
belonging
to
the
present
if
the
two
series
happen
to
coincide
in
our
imagination
there
will
be
no
resulting
and
yet
the
same
comic
effect
will
continue
to
take
place
think
of
bonivard
captive
in
the
castle
of
chillon
one
series
of
facts
now
picture
to
yourself
tartarin
travelling
in
switzerland
arrested
and
imprisoned
second
series
independent
of
the
former
now
let
tartarin
be
manacled
to
chain
thus
making
the
two
stories
seem
for
a
moment
to
coincide
and
you
will
get
a
very
amusing
scene
one
of
the
most
amusing
that
daudet
imagination
has
pictured
tartarin
sur
les
alpes
by
daudet
numerous
incidents
of
the
style
if
analysed
would
reveal
the
same
elements
the
transposition
from
the
ancient
to
the
modern
always
a
laughable
one
draws
its
inspiration
from
the
same
idea
labiche
has
made
use
of
this
method
in
every
shape
and
form
sometimes
he
begins
by
building
up
the
series
separately
and
then
delights
in
making
them
interfere
with
one
another
he
takes
an
independent
group
a
for
instance
and
throws
them
into
altogether
unconnected
surroundings
into
which
certain
coincidences
allow
of
their
being
foisted
for
the
time
being
sometimes
he
keeps
one
and
the
same
set
of
characters
right
through
the
play
but
contrives
that
certain
of
these
characters
have
something
to
conceal
have
in
fact
a
secret
understanding
on
the
point
in
short
play
a
smaller
comedy
within
the
principal
one
at
one
moment
one
of
the
two
comedies
is
on
the
point
of
upsetting
the
other
the
next
everything
comes
right
and
the
coincidence
between
the
two
series
is
restored
sometimes
even
he
introduces
into
the
actual
series
a
purely
immaterial
series
of
events
an
inconvenient
past
for
instance
that
some
one
has
an
interest
in
concealing
but
which
is
continually
cropping
up
in
the
present
and
on
each
occasion
is
successfully
brought
into
line
with
situations
with
which
it
seemed
destined
to
play
havoc
but
in
every
case
we
find
the
two
independent
series
and
also
their
partial
coincidence
we
will
not
carry
any
further
this
analysis
of
the
methods
of
light
comedy
whether
we
find
reciprocal
interference
of
series
inversion
or
repetition
we
see
that
the
objective
is
always
the
same
to
obtain
what
we
have
called
a
mechanisation
of
life
you
take
a
set
of
actions
and
relations
and
repeat
it
as
it
is
or
turn
it
upside
down
or
transfer
it
bodily
to
another
set
with
which
it
partially
coincides
all
these
being
processes
that
consist
in
looking
upon
life
as
a
repeating
mechanism
with
reversible
action
and
interchangeable
parts
actual
life
is
comedy
just
so
far
as
it
produces
in
a
natural
fashion
actions
of
the
same
kind
consequently
just
so
far
as
it
forgets
itself
for
were
it
always
on
the
alert
it
would
be
continuity
irrevertible
progress
undivided
unity
and
so
the
ludicrous
in
events
may
be
defined
as
absentmindedness
in
things
just
as
the
ludicrous
in
an
individual
character
always
results
from
some
fundamental
absentmindedness
in
the
person
as
we
have
already
intimated
and
shall
prove
later
on
this
absentmindedness
in
events
however
is
exceptional
its
results
are
slight
at
any
rate
it
is
incurable
so
that
it
is
useless
to
laugh
at
it
therefore
the
idea
would
never
have
occurred
to
any
one
of
exaggerating
that
absentmindedness
of
converting
it
into
a
system
and
creating
an
art
for
it
if
laughter
were
not
always
a
pleasure
and
mankind
did
not
pounce
upon
the
slightest
excuse
for
indulging
in
it
this
is
the
real
explanation
of
light
comedy
which
holds
the
same
relation
to
actual
life
as
does
a
jointed
to
a
man
walking
being
as
it
is
an
artificial
exaggeration
of
a
natural
rigidity
in
things
the
thread
that
binds
it
to
actual
life
is
a
very
fragile
one
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
game
which
like
all
games
depends
on
a
previously
accepted
convention
comedy
in
character
strikes
far
deeper
roots
into
life
with
that
kind
of
comedy
we
shall
deal
more
particularly
in
the
final
portion
of
our
investigation
but
we
must
first
analyse
a
certain
type
of
the
comic
in
many
respects
similar
to
that
of
light
comedy
the
comic
in
words
ii
there
may
be
something
artificial
in
making
a
special
category
for
the
comic
in
words
since
most
of
the
varieties
of
the
comic
that
we
have
examined
so
far
were
produced
through
the
medium
of
language
we
must
make
a
distinction
however
between
the
comic
expressed
and
the
comic
created
by
language
the
former
could
if
necessary
be
translated
from
one
language
into
another
though
at
the
cost
of
losing
the
greater
portion
of
its
significance
when
introduced
into
a
fresh
society
different
in
manners
in
literature
and
above
all
in
association
of
ideas
but
it
is
generally
impossible
to
translate
the
latter
it
owes
its
entire
being
to
the
structure
of
the
sentence
or
to
the
choice
of
the
words
it
does
not
set
forth
by
means
of
language
special
cases
of
absentmindedness
in
man
or
in
events
it
lays
stress
on
lapses
of
attention
in
language
itself
in
this
case
it
is
language
itself
that
becomes
comic
comic
sayings
however
are
not
a
matter
of
spontaneous
generation
if
we
laugh
at
them
we
are
equally
entitled
to
laugh
at
their
author
this
latter
condition
however
is
not
indispensable
since
the
saying
or
expression
has
a
comic
virtue
of
its
own
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
we
find
it
very
difficult
in
the
majority
of
these
cases
to
say
whom
we
are
laughing
at
although
at
times
we
have
a
dim
vague
feeling
that
there
is
some
one
in
the
background
moreover
the
person
implicated
is
not
always
the
speaker
here
it
seems
as
though
we
should
draw
an
important
distinction
between
the
witty
spirituel
and
the
comic
a
word
is
said
to
be
comic
when
it
makes
us
laugh
at
the
person
who
utters
it
and
witty
when
it
makes
us
laugh
either
at
a
third
party
or
at
ourselves
but
in
most
cases
we
can
hardly
make
up
our
minds
whether
the
word
is
comic
or
witty
all
that
we
can
say
is
that
it
is
laughable
before
proceeding
it
might
be
well
to
examine
more
closely
what
is
meant
by
esprit
a
witty
saying
makes
us
at
least
smile
consequently
no
investigation
into
laughter
would
be
complete
did
it
not
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
nature
of
wit
and
throw
light
on
the
underlying
idea
it
is
to
be
feared
however
that
this
extremely
subtle
essence
is
one
that
evaporates
when
exposed
to
the
light
let
us
first
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
meanings
of
the
word
wit
esprit
the
broader
one
and
the
more
restricted
in
the
broader
meaning
of
the
word
it
would
seem
that
what
is
called
wit
is
a
certain
dramatic
way
of
thinking
instead
of
treating
his
ideas
as
mere
symbols
the
wit
sees
them
he
hears
them
and
above
all
makes
them
converse
with
one
another
like
persons
he
puts
them
on
the
stage
and
himself
to
some
extent
into
the
bargain
a
witty
nation
is
of
necessity
a
nation
enamoured
of
the
theatre
in
every
wit
there
is
something
of
a
poet
just
as
in
every
good
reader
there
is
the
making
of
an
actor
this
comparison
is
made
purposely
because
a
proportion
might
easily
be
established
between
the
four
terms
in
order
to
read
well
we
need
only
the
intellectual
side
of
the
actor
art
but
in
order
to
act
well
one
must
be
an
actor
in
all
one
soul
and
body
in
just
the
same
way
poetic
creation
calls
for
some
degree
of
whilst
the
wit
does
not
usually
err
in
this
respect
we
always
get
a
glimpse
of
the
latter
behind
what
he
says
and
does
he
is
not
wholly
engrossed
in
the
business
because
he
only
brings
his
intelligence
into
play
so
any
poet
may
reveal
himself
as
a
wit
when
he
pleases
to
do
this
there
will
be
no
need
for
him
to
acquire
anything
it
seems
rather
as
though
he
would
have
to
give
up
something
he
would
simply
have
to
let
his
ideas
hold
converse
with
one
another
for
nothing
for
the
mere
joy
of
the
thing
footnote
pour
rien
pour
le
plaisir
is
a
quotation
from
victor
hugo
marion
delorme
he
would
only
have
to
unfasten
the
double
bond
which
keeps
his
ideas
in
touch
with
his
feelings
and
his
soul
in
touch
with
life
in
short
he
would
turn
into
a
wit
by
simply
resolving
to
be
no
longer
a
poet
in
feeling
but
only
in
intelligence
but
if
wit
consists
for
the
most
part
in
seeing
things
sub
specie
theatri
it
is
evidently
capable
of
being
specially
directed
to
one
variety
of
dramatic
art
namely
comedy
here
we
have
a
more
restricted
meaning
of
the
term
and
moreover
the
only
one
that
interests
us
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
laughter
what
is
here
called
wit
is
a
gift
for
dashing
off
comic
scenes
in
a
few
strokes
dashing
them
off
however
so
subtly
delicately
and
rapidly
that
all
is
over
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
notice
them
who
are
the
actors
in
these
scenes
with
whom
has
the
wit
to
deal
first
of
all
with
his
interlocutors
themselves
when
his
witticism
is
a
direct
retort
to
one
of
them
often
with
an
absent
person
whom
he
supposes
to
have
spoken
and
to
whom
he
is
replying
still
oftener
with
the
whole
world
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
which
he
takes
to
task
twisting
a
current
idea
into
a
paradox
or
making
use
of
a
hackneyed
phrase
or
parodying
some
quotation
or
proverb
if
we
compare
these
scenes
in
miniature
with
one
another
we
find
they
are
almost
always
variations
of
a
comic
theme
with
which
we
are
well
acquainted
that
of
the
robber
robbed
you
take
up
a
metaphor
a
phrase
an
argument
and
turn
it
against
the
man
who
is
or
might
be
its
author
so
that
he
is
made
to
say
what
he
did
not
mean
to
say
and
lets
himself
be
caught
to
some
extent
in
the
toils
of
language
but
the
theme
of
the
robber
robbed
is
not
the
only
possible
one
we
have
gone
over
many
varieties
of
the
comic
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
is
incapable
of
being
volatilised
into
a
witticism
every
witty
remark
then
lends
itself
to
an
analysis
whose
chemical
formula
so
to
say
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
state
it
runs
as
follows
take
the
remark
first
enlarge
it
into
a
regular
scene
then
find
out
the
category
of
the
comic
to
which
the
scene
evidently
belongs
by
this
means
you
reduce
the
witty
remark
to
its
simplest
elements
and
obtain
a
full
explanation
of
it
let
us
apply
this
method
to
a
classic
example
your
chest
hurts
me
mal
a
votre
poitrine
wrote
mme
de
sevigne
to
her
ailing
daughter
clearly
a
witty
saying
if
our
theory
is
correct
we
need
only
lay
stress
upon
the
saying
enlarge
and
magnify
it
and
we
shall
see
it
expand
into
a
comic
scene
now
we
find
this
very
scene
ready
made
in
the
amour
medecin
of
moliere
the
sham
doctor
clitandre
who
has
been
summoned
to
attend
sganarelle
daughter
contents
himself
with
feeling
sganarelle
own
pulse
whereupon
relying
on
the
sympathy
there
must
be
between
father
and
daughter
he
unhesitatingly
concludes
your
daughter
is
very
ill
here
we
have
the
transition
from
the
witty
to
the
comical
to
complete
our
analysis
then
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
discover
what
there
is
comical
in
the
idea
of
giving
a
diagnosis
of
the
child
after
sounding
the
father
or
the
mother
well
we
know
that
one
essential
form
of
comic
fancy
lies
in
picturing
to
ourselves
a
living
person
as
a
kind
of
jointed
and
that
frequently
with
the
object
of
inducing
us
to
form
this
mental
picture
we
are
shown
two
or
more
persons
speaking
and
acting
as
though
attached
to
one
another
by
invisible
strings
is
not
this
the
idea
here
suggested
when
we
are
led
to
materialise
so
to
speak
the
sympathy
we
postulate
as
existing
between
father
and
daughter
we
now
see
how
it
is
that
writers
on
wit
have
perforce
confined
themselves
to
commenting
on
the
extraordinary
complexity
of
the
things
denoted
by
the
term
without
ever
succeeding
in
defining
it
there
are
many
ways
of
being
witty
almost
as
many
as
there
are
of
being
the
reverse
how
can
we
detect
what
they
have
in
common
with
one
another
unless
we
first
determine
the
general
relationship
between
the
witty
and
the
comic
once
however
this
relationship
is
cleared
up
everything
is
plain
sailing
we
then
find
the
same
connection
between
the
comic
and
the
witty
as
exists
between
a
regular
scene
and
the
fugitive
suggestion
of
a
possible
one
hence
however
numerous
the
forms
assumed
by
the
comic
wit
will
possess
an
equal
number
of
corresponding
varieties
so
that
the
comic
in
all
its
forms
is
what
should
be
defined
first
by
discovering
a
task
which
is
already
quite
difficult
enough
the
clue
that
leads
from
one
form
to
the
other
by
that
very
operation
wit
will
have
been
analysed
and
will
then
appear
as
nothing
more
than
the
comic
in
a
highly
volatile
state
to
follow
the
opposite
plan
however
and
attempt
directly
to
evolve
a
formula
for
wit
would
be
courting
certain
failure
what
should
we
think
of
a
chemist
who
having
ever
so
many
jars
of
a
certain
substance
in
his
laboratory
would
prefer
getting
that
substance
from
the
atmosphere
in
which
merely
infinitesimal
traces
of
its
vapour
are
to
be
found
but
this
comparison
between
the
witty
and
the
comic
is
also
indicative
of
the
line
we
must
take
in
studying
the
comic
in
words
on
the
one
hand
indeed
we
find
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
a
word
that
is
comic
and
one
that
is
witty
on
the
other
hand
the
latter
although
connected
with
a
figure
of
speech
invariably
calls
up
the
image
dim
or
distinct
of
a
comic
scene
this
amounts
to
saying
that
the
comic
in
speech
should
correspond
point
by
point
with
the
comic
in
actions
and
in
situations
and
is
nothing
more
if
one
may
so
express
oneself
than
their
projection
on
to
the
plane
of
words
so
let
us
return
to
the
comic
in
actions
and
in
situations
consider
the
chief
methods
by
which
it
is
obtained
and
apply
them
to
the
choice
of
words
and
the
building
up
of
sentences
we
shall
thus
have
every
possible
form
of
the
comic
in
words
as
well
as
every
variety
of
wit
inadvertently
to
say
or
do
what
we
have
no
intention
of
saying
or
doing
as
a
result
of
inelasticity
or
momentum
is
as
we
are
aware
one
of
the
main
sources
of
the
comic
thus
absentmindedness
is
essentially
laughable
and
so
we
laugh
at
anything
rigid
mechanical
in
gesture
attitude
and
even
facial
expression
do
we
find
this
kind
of
rigidity
in
language
also
no
doubt
we
do
since
language
contains
formulas
and
stereotyped
phrases
the
man
who
always
expressed
himself
in
such
terms
would
invariably
be
comic
but
if
an
isolated
phrase
is
to
be
comic
in
itself
when
once
separated
from
the
person
who
utters
it
it
must
be
something
more
than
it
must
bear
within
itself
some
sign
which
tells
us
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
it
was
uttered
automatically
this
can
only
happen
when
the
phrase
embodies
some
evident
absurdity
either
a
palpable
error
or
a
contradiction
in
terms
hence
the
following
general
rule
a
comic
meaning
is
invariably
obtained
when
an
absurd
idea
is
fitted
into
a
ce
sabre
est
le
plus
beau
jour
de
ma
vie
said
prudhomme
translate
the
phrase
into
english
or
german
and
it
becomes
purely
absurd
though
it
is
comic
enough
in
french
the
reason
is
that
le
plus
beau
jour
de
ma
vie
is
one
of
those
to
which
a
frenchman
ear
is
accustomed
to
make
it
comic
then
we
need
only
clearly
indicate
the
automatism
of
the
person
who
utters
it
this
is
what
we
get
when
we
introduce
an
absurdity
into
the
phrase
here
the
absurdity
is
by
no
means
the
source
of
the
comic
it
is
only
a
very
simple
and
effective
means
of
making
it
obvious
we
have
quoted
only
one
saying
of
prudhomme
but
the
majority
of
those
attributed
to
him
belong
to
the
same
class
prudhomme
is
a
man
of
phrases
and
as
there
are
phrases
in
all
languages
prudhomme
is
always
capable
of
being
transposed
though
seldom
of
being
translated
at
times
the
commonplace
phrase
under
cover
of
which
the
absurdity
slips
in
is
not
so
readily
noticeable
i
do
like
working
between
meals
said
a
lazy
lout
there
would
be
nothing
amusing
in
the
saying
did
there
not
exist
that
salutary
precept
in
the
realm
of
hygiene
one
should
not
eat
between
meals
sometimes
too
the
effect
is
a
complicated
one
instead
of
one
commonplace
there
are
two
or
three
which
are
dovetailed
into
each
other
take
for
instance
the
remark
of
one
of
the
characters
in
a
play
by
labiche
only
god
has
the
right
to
kill
his
it
would
seem
that
advantage
is
here
taken
of
two
separate
familiar
sayings
it
is
god
who
disposes
of
the
lives
of
men
and
it
is
criminal
for
a
man
to
kill
his
but
the
two
sayings
are
combined
so
as
to
deceive
the
ear
and
leave
the
impression
of
being
one
of
those
hackneyed
sentences
that
are
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
hence
our
attention
nods
until
we
are
suddenly
aroused
by
the
absurdity
of
the
meaning
these
examples
suffice
to
show
how
one
of
the
most
important
types
of
the
comic
can
be
projected
in
a
simplified
form
on
the
plane
of
speech
we
will
now
proceed
to
a
form
which
is
not
so
general
we
laugh
if
our
attention
is
diverted
to
the
physical
in
a
person
when
it
is
the
moral
that
is
in
question
is
a
law
we
laid
down
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
let
us
apply
it
to
language
most
words
might
be
said
to
have
a
physical
and
a
moral
meaning
according
as
they
are
interpreted
literally
or
figuratively
every
word
indeed
begins
by
denoting
a
concrete
object
or
a
material
action
but
by
degrees
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
refined
into
an
abstract
relation
or
a
pure
idea
if
then
the
above
law
holds
good
here
it
should
be
stated
as
follows
a
comic
effect
is
obtained
whenever
we
pretend
to
take
literally
an
expression
which
was
used
figuratively
or
once
our
attention
is
fixed
on
the
material
aspect
of
a
metaphor
the
idea
expressed
becomes
comic
in
the
phrase
tous
les
arts
sont
freres
all
the
arts
are
brothers
the
word
frere
brother
is
used
metaphorically
to
indicate
a
more
or
less
striking
resemblance
the
word
is
so
often
used
in
this
way
that
when
we
hear
it
we
do
not
think
of
the
concrete
the
material
connection
implied
in
every
relationship
we
should
notice
it
more
if
we
were
told
that
tous
les
arts
sont
cousins
for
the
word
cousin
is
not
so
often
employed
in
a
figurative
sense
that
is
why
the
word
here
already
assumes
a
slight
tinge
of
the
comic
but
let
us
go
further
still
and
suppose
that
our
attention
is
attracted
to
the
material
side
of
the
metaphor
by
the
choice
of
a
relationship
which
is
incompatible
with
the
gender
of
the
two
words
composing
the
metaphorical
expression
we
get
a
laughable
result
such
is
the
saying
also
attributed
to
prudhomme
tous
les
arts
masculine
sont
soeurs
feminine
he
is
always
running
after
a
joke
was
said
in
boufflers
presence
regarding
a
very
conceited
fellow
had
boufflers
replied
he
wo
catch
it
that
would
have
been
the
beginning
of
a
witty
saying
though
nothing
more
than
the
beginning
for
the
word
catch
is
interpreted
figuratively
almost
as
often
as
the
word
run
nor
does
it
compel
us
more
strongly
than
the
latter
to
materialise
the
image
of
two
runners
the
one
at
the
heels
of
the
other
in
order
that
the
rejoinder
may
appear
to
be
a
thoroughly
witty
one
we
must
borrow
from
the
language
of
sport
an
expression
so
vivid
and
concrete
that
we
can
not
refrain
from
witnessing
the
race
in
good
earnest
this
is
what
boufflers
does
when
he
retorts
i
back
the
joke
we
said
that
wit
often
consists
in
extending
the
idea
of
interlocutor
to
the
point
of
making
him
express
the
opposite
of
what
he
thinks
and
getting
him
so
to
say
entrapt
by
his
own
words
we
must
now
add
that
this
trap
is
almost
always
some
metaphor
or
comparison
the
concrete
aspect
of
which
is
turned
against
him
you
may
remember
the
dialogue
between
a
mother
and
her
son
in
the
faux
bonshommes
my
dear
boy
gambling
on
is
very
risky
you
win
one
day
and
lose
the
next
well
then
i
will
gamble
only
every
other
day
in
the
same
play
too
we
find
the
following
edifying
conversation
between
two
is
this
a
very
honourable
thing
we
are
doing
these
unfortunate
shareholders
you
see
we
are
taking
the
money
out
of
their
very
pockets
well
out
of
what
do
you
expect
us
to
take
it
an
amusing
result
is
likewise
obtainable
whenever
a
symbol
or
an
emblem
is
expanded
on
its
concrete
side
and
a
pretence
is
made
of
retaining
the
same
symbolical
value
for
this
expansion
as
for
the
emblem
itself
in
a
very
lively
comedy
we
are
introduced
to
a
monte
carlo
official
whose
uniform
is
covered
with
medals
although
he
has
only
received
a
single
decoration
you
see
i
staked
my
medal
on
a
number
at
roulette
he
said
and
as
the
number
turned
up
i
was
entitled
to
times
my
stake
this
reasoning
is
very
similar
to
that
offered
by
giboyer
in
the
effrontes
criticism
is
made
of
a
bride
of
forty
summers
who
is
wearing
with
her
wedding
costume
why
she
was
entitled
to
oranges
let
alone
remarked
giboyer
but
we
should
never
cease
were
we
to
take
one
by
one
all
the
laws
we
have
stated
and
try
to
prove
them
on
what
we
have
called
the
plane
of
language
we
had
better
confine
ourselves
to
the
three
general
propositions
of
the
preceding
section
we
have
shown
that
series
of
events
may
become
comic
either
by
repetition
by
inversion
or
by
reciprocal
interference
now
we
shall
see
that
this
is
also
the
case
with
series
of
words
to
take
series
of
events
and
repeat
them
in
another
key
or
another
environment
or
to
invert
them
whilst
still
leaving
them
a
certain
meaning
or
mix
them
up
so
that
their
respective
meanings
jostle
one
another
is
invariably
comic
as
we
have
already
said
for
it
is
getting
life
to
submit
to
be
treated
as
a
machine
but
thought
too
is
a
living
thing
and
language
the
translation
of
thought
should
be
just
as
living
we
may
thus
surmise
that
a
phrase
is
likely
to
become
comic
if
though
reversed
it
still
makes
sense
or
if
it
expresses
equally
well
two
quite
independent
sets
of
ideas
or
finally
if
it
has
been
obtained
by
transposing
an
idea
into
some
key
other
than
its
own
such
indeed
are
the
three
fundamental
laws
of
what
might
be
called
the
comic
transformation
of
sentences
as
we
shall
show
by
a
few
examples
let
it
first
be
said
that
these
three
laws
are
far
from
being
of
equal
importance
as
regards
the
theory
of
the
ludicrous
inversion
is
the
least
interesting
of
the
three
it
must
be
easy
of
application
however
for
it
is
noticeable
that
no
sooner
do
professional
wits
hear
a
sentence
spoken
than
they
experiment
to
see
if
a
meaning
can
not
be
obtained
by
reversing
it
by
putting
for
instance
the
subject
in
place
of
the
object
and
the
object
in
place
of
the
subject
it
is
not
unusual
for
this
device
to
be
employed
for
refuting
an
idea
in
more
or
less
humorous
terms
one
of
the
characters
in
a
comedy
of
labiche
shouts
out
to
his
neighbour
on
the
floor
above
who
is
in
the
habit
of
dirtying
his
balcony
what
do
you
mean
by
emptying
your
pipe
on
to
my
terrace
the
neighbour
retorts
what
do
you
mean
by
putting
your
terrace
under
my
pipe
there
is
no
necessity
to
dwell
upon
this
kind
of
wit
instances
of
which
could
easily
be
multiplied
the
reciprocal
interference
of
two
sets
of
ideas
in
the
same
sentence
is
an
inexhaustible
source
of
amusing
varieties
there
are
many
ways
of
bringing
about
this
interference
i
mean
of
bracketing
in
the
same
expression
two
independent
meanings
that
apparently
tally
the
least
reputable
of
these
ways
is
the
pun
in
the
pun
the
same
sentence
appears
to
offer
two
independent
meanings
but
it
is
only
an
appearance
in
reality
there
are
two
different
sentences
made
up
of
different
words
but
claiming
to
be
one
and
the
same
because
both
have
the
same
sound
we
pass
from
the
pun
by
imperceptible
stages
to
the
true
play
upon
words
here
there
is
really
one
and
the
same
sentence
through
which
two
different
sets
of
ideas
are
expressed
and
we
are
confronted
with
only
one
series
of
words
but
advantage
is
taken
of
the
different
meanings
a
word
may
have
especially
when
used
figuratively
instead
of
literally
so
that
in
fact
there
is
often
only
a
slight
difference
between
the
play
upon
words
on
the
one
hand
and
a
poetic
metaphor
or
an
illuminating
comparison
on
the
other
whereas
an
illuminating
comparison
and
a
striking
image
always
seem
to
reveal
the
close
harmony
that
exists
between
language
and
nature
regarded
as
two
parallel
forms
of
life
the
play
upon
words
makes
us
think
somehow
of
a
negligence
on
the
part
of
language
which
for
the
time
being
seems
to
have
forgotten
its
real
function
and
now
claims
to
accommodate
things
to
itself
instead
of
accommodating
itself
to
things
and
so
the
play
upon
words
always
betrays
a
momentary
lapse
of
attention
in
language
and
it
is
precisely
on
that
account
that
it
is
amusing
inversion
and
reciprocal
interference
after
all
are
only
a
certain
playfulness
of
the
mind
which
ends
at
playing
upon
words
the
comic
in
transposition
is
much
more
indeed
transposition
is
to
ordinary
language
what
repetition
is
to
comedy
we
said
that
repetition
is
the
favourite
method
of
classic
comedy
it
consists
in
so
arranging
events
that
a
scene
is
reproduced
either
between
the
same
characters
under
fresh
circumstances
or
between
fresh
characters
under
the
same
circumstances
thus
we
have
repeated
by
lackeys
in
less
dignified
language
a
scene
already
played
by
their
masters
now
imagine
ideas
expressed
in
suitable
style
and
thus
placed
in
the
setting
of
their
natural
environment
if
you
think
of
some
arrangement
whereby
they
are
transferred
to
fresh
surroundings
while
maintaining
their
mutual
relations
or
in
other
words
if
you
can
induce
them
to
express
themselves
in
an
altogether
different
style
and
to
transpose
themselves
into
another
key
you
will
have
language
itself
playing
a
comedy
language
itself
made
comic
there
will
be
no
need
moreover
actually
to
set
before
us
both
expressions
of
the
same
ideas
the
transposed
expression
and
the
natural
one
for
we
are
acquainted
with
the
natural
one
the
one
which
we
should
have
chosen
instinctively
so
it
will
be
enough
if
the
effort
of
comic
invention
bears
on
the
other
and
on
the
other
alone
no
sooner
is
the
second
set
before
us
than
we
spontaneously
supply
the
first
hence
the
following
general
rule
a
comic
effect
is
always
obtainable
by
transposing
the
nature
expression
of
an
idea
into
another
key
the
means
of
transposition
are
so
many
and
varied
language
affords
so
rich
a
continuity
of
themes
and
the
comic
is
here
capable
of
passing
through
so
great
a
number
of
stages
from
the
most
insipid
buffoonery
up
to
the
loftiest
forms
of
humour
and
irony
that
we
shall
forego
the
attempt
to
make
out
a
complete
list
having
stated
the
rule
we
will
simply
here
and
there
verify
its
main
applications
in
the
first
place
we
may
distinguish
two
keys
at
the
extreme
ends
of
the
scale
the
solemn
and
the
familiar
the
most
obvious
effects
are
obtained
by
merely
transposing
the
one
into
the
other
which
thus
provides
us
with
two
opposite
currents
of
comic
fancy
transpose
the
solemn
into
the
familiar
and
the
result
is
parody
the
effect
of
parody
thus
defined
extends
to
instances
in
which
the
idea
expressed
in
familiar
terms
is
one
that
if
only
in
deference
to
custom
ought
to
be
pitched
in
another
key
take
as
an
example
the
following
description
of
the
dawn
quoted
by
jean
paul
richter
the
sky
was
beginning
to
change
from
black
to
red
like
a
lobster
being
boiled
note
that
the
expression
of
matters
in
terms
of
modern
life
produces
the
same
effect
by
reason
of
the
halo
of
poetry
which
surrounds
classical
antiquity
it
is
doubtless
the
comic
in
parody
that
has
suggested
to
some
philosophers
and
in
particular
to
alexander
bain
the
idea
of
defining
the
comic
in
general
as
a
species
of
degradation
they
describe
the
laughable
as
causing
something
to
appear
mean
that
was
formerly
dignified
but
if
our
analysis
is
correct
degradation
is
only
one
form
of
transposition
and
transposition
itself
only
one
of
the
means
of
obtaining
laughter
there
is
a
host
of
others
and
the
source
of
laughter
must
be
sought
for
much
further
back
moreover
without
going
so
far
we
see
that
while
the
transposition
from
solemn
to
trivial
from
better
to
worse
is
comic
the
inverse
transposition
may
be
even
more
so
it
is
met
with
as
often
as
the
other
and
apparently
we
may
distinguish
two
main
forms
of
it
according
as
it
refers
to
the
physical
dimensions
of
an
object
or
to
its
moral
value
to
speak
of
small
things
as
though
they
were
large
is
in
a
general
way
to
exaggerate
exaggeration
is
always
comic
when
prolonged
and
especially
when
systematic
then
indeed
it
appears
as
one
method
of
transposition
it
excites
so
much
laughter
that
some
writers
have
been
led
to
define
the
comic
as
exaggeration
just
as
others
have
defined
it
as
degradation
as
a
matter
of
fact
exaggeration
like
degradation
is
only
one
form
of
one
kind
of
the
comic
still
it
is
a
very
striking
form
it
has
given
birth
to
the
poem
a
rather
device
i
admit
though
traces
of
it
are
still
to
be
found
in
persons
inclined
to
exaggerate
methodically
it
might
often
be
said
of
braggadocio
that
it
is
its
aspect
which
makes
us
laugh
far
more
artificial
but
also
far
more
refined
is
the
transposition
upwards
from
below
when
applied
to
the
moral
value
of
things
not
to
their
physical
dimensions
to
express
in
reputable
language
some
disreputable
idea
to
take
some
scandalous
situation
some
calling
or
disgraceful
behaviour
and
describe
them
in
terms
of
the
utmost
respectability
is
generally
comic
the
english
word
is
here
purposely
employed
as
the
practice
itself
is
characteristically
english
many
instances
of
it
may
be
found
in
dickens
and
thackeray
and
in
english
literature
generally
let
us
remark
in
passing
that
the
intensity
of
the
effect
does
not
here
depend
on
its
length
a
word
is
sometimes
sufficient
provided
it
gives
us
a
glimpse
of
an
entire
system
of
transposition
accepted
in
certain
social
circles
and
reveals
as
it
were
a
moral
organisation
of
immorality
take
the
following
remark
made
by
an
official
to
one
of
his
subordinates
in
a
novel
of
gogol
your
peculations
are
too
extensive
for
an
official
of
your
rank
summing
up
the
foregoing
then
there
are
two
extreme
terms
of
comparison
the
very
large
and
the
very
small
the
best
and
the
worst
between
which
transposition
may
be
effected
in
one
direction
or
the
other
now
if
the
interval
be
gradually
narrowed
the
contrast
between
the
terms
obtained
will
be
less
and
less
violent
and
the
varieties
of
comic
transposition
more
and
more
subtle
the
most
common
of
these
contrasts
is
perhaps
that
between
the
real
and
the
ideal
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
here
again
transposition
may
take
place
in
either
direction
sometimes
we
state
what
ought
to
be
done
and
pretend
to
believe
that
this
is
just
what
is
actually
being
done
then
we
have
irony
sometimes
on
the
contrary
we
describe
with
scrupulous
minuteness
what
is
being
done
and
pretend
to
believe
that
this
is
just
what
ought
to
be
done
such
is
often
the
method
of
humour
humour
thus
denned
is
the
counterpart
of
irony
both
are
forms
of
satire
but
irony
is
oratorical
in
its
nature
whilst
humour
partakes
of
the
scientific
irony
is
emphasised
the
higher
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
uplifted
by
the
idea
of
the
good
that
ought
to
be
thus
irony
may
grow
so
hot
within
us
that
it
becomes
a
kind
of
eloquence
on
the
other
hand
humour
is
the
more
emphasised
the
deeper
we
go
down
into
an
evil
that
actually
is
in
order
t
o
set
down
its
details
in
the
most
indifference
several
authors
jean
paul
amongst
them
have
noticed
that
humour
delights
in
concrete
terms
technical
details
definite
facts
if
our
analysis
is
correct
this
is
not
an
accidental
trait
of
humour
it
is
its
very
essence
a
humorist
is
a
moralist
disguised
as
a
scientist
something
like
an
anatomist
who
practises
dissection
with
the
sole
object
of
filling
us
with
disgust
so
that
humour
in
the
restricted
sense
in
which
we
are
here
regarding
the
word
is
really
a
transposition
from
the
moral
to
the
scientific
by
still
further
curtailing
the
interval
between
the
terms
transposed
we
may
now
obtain
more
and
more
specialised
types
of
comic
transpositions
thus
certain
professions
have
a
technical
vocabulary
what
a
wealth
of
laughable
results
have
been
obtained
by
transposing
the
ideas
of
everyday
life
into
this
professional
jargon
equally
comic
is
the
extension
of
business
phraseology
to
the
social
relations
of
life
for
instance
the
phrase
of
one
of
labiche
characters
in
allusion
to
an
invitation
he
has
received
your
kindness
of
the
third
thus
transposing
the
commercial
formula
your
favour
of
the
third
instant
this
class
of
the
comic
moreover
may
attain
a
special
profundity
of
its
own
when
it
discloses
not
merely
a
professional
practice
but
a
fault
in
character
recall
to
mind
the
scenes
in
the
faux
bonshommes
and
the
famille
benoiton
where
marriage
is
dealt
with
as
a
business
affair
and
matters
of
sentiment
are
set
down
in
strictly
commercial
language
here
however
we
reach
the
point
at
which
peculiarities
of
language
really
express
peculiarities
of
character
a
closer
investigation
of
which
we
must
hold
over
to
the
next
chapter
thus
as
might
have
been
expected
and
may
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
the
comic
in
words
follows
closely
on
the
comic
in
situation
and
is
finally
merged
along
with
the
latter
in
the
comic
in
character
language
only
attains
laughable
results
because
it
is
a
human
product
modelled
as
exactly
as
possible
on
the
forms
of
the
human
mind
we
feel
it
contains
some
living
element
of
our
own
life
and
if
this
life
of
language
were
complete
and
perfect
if
there
were
nothing
stereotype
in
it
if
in
short
language
were
an
absolutely
unified
organism
incapable
of
being
split
up
into
independent
organisms
it
would
evade
the
comic
as
would
a
soul
whose
life
was
one
harmonious
whole
unruffled
as
the
calm
surface
of
a
peaceful
lake
there
is
no
pool
however
which
has
not
some
dead
leaves
floating
on
its
surface
no
human
soul
upon
which
there
do
not
settle
habits
that
make
it
rigid
against
itself
by
making
it
rigid
against
others
no
language
in
short
so
subtle
and
instinct
with
life
so
fully
alert
in
each
of
its
parts
as
to
eliminate
the
and
oppose
the
mechanical
operations
of
inversion
transposition
which
one
would
fain
perform
upon
it
as
on
some
lifeless
thing
the
rigid
the
ready
made
the
mechanical
in
contrast
with
the
supple
the
and
the
living
absentmindedness
in
contrast
with
attention
in
a
word
automatism
in
contrast
with
free
activity
such
are
the
defects
that
laughter
singles
out
and
would
fain
correct
we
appealed
to
this
idea
to
give
us
light
at
the
outset
when
starting
upon
the
analysis
of
the
ludicrous
we
have
seen
it
shining
at
every
decisive
turning
in
our
road
with
its
help
we
shall
now
enter
upon
a
more
important
investigation
one
that
will
we
hope
be
more
instructive
we
purpose
in
short
studying
comic
characters
or
rather
determining
the
essential
conditions
of
comedy
in
character
while
endeavouring
to
bring
it
about
that
this
study
may
contribute
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
real
nature
of
art
and
the
general
relation
between
art
and
life
chapter
iii
the
comic
in
character
i
we
have
followed
the
comic
along
many
of
its
winding
channels
in
an
endeavour
to
discover
how
it
percolates
into
a
form
an
attitude
or
a
gesture
a
situation
an
action
or
an
expression
the
analysis
of
comic
characters
has
now
brought
us
to
the
most
important
part
of
our
task
it
would
also
be
the
most
difficult
had
we
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
defining
the
laughable
by
a
few
striking
and
consequently
obvious
examples
for
then
in
proportion
as
we
advanced
towards
the
loftiest
manifestations
of
the
comic
we
should
have
found
the
facts
slipping
between
the
meshes
of
the
definition
intended
to
retain
them
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
followed
the
opposite
plan
by
throwing
light
on
the
subject
from
above
convinced
that
laughter
has
a
social
meaning
and
import
that
the
comic
expresses
above
all
else
a
special
lack
of
adaptability
to
society
and
that
in
short
there
is
nothing
comic
apart
from
man
we
have
made
man
and
character
generally
our
main
objective
our
chief
difficulty
therefore
has
lain
in
explaining
how
we
come
to
laugh
at
anything
else
than
character
and
by
what
subtle
processes
of
fertilisation
combination
or
amalgamation
the
comic
can
worm
its
way
into
a
mere
movement
an
impersonal
situation
or
an
independent
phrase
this
is
what
we
have
done
so
far
we
started
with
the
pure
metal
and
all
our
endeavours
have
been
directed
solely
towards
reconstructing
the
ore
it
is
the
metal
itself
we
are
now
about
to
study
nothing
could
be
easier
for
this
time
we
have
a
simple
element
to
deal
with
let
us
examine
it
closely
and
see
how
it
reacts
upon
everything
else
there
are
moods
we
said
which
move
us
as
soon
us
as
soon
as
we
perceive
them
joys
and
sorrows
with
which
we
sympathise
passions
and
vices
which
call
forth
painful
astonishment
terror
or
pity
in
the
beholder
in
short
sentiments
that
are
prolonged
in
sentimental
overtones
from
mind
to
mind
all
this
concerns
the
essentials
of
life
all
this
is
serious
at
times
even
tragic
comedy
can
only
begin
at
the
point
where
our
neighbour
personality
ceases
to
affect
us
it
begins
in
fact
with
what
might
be
called
a
growing
callousness
to
social
life
any
individual
is
comic
who
automatically
goes
his
own
way
without
troubling
himself
about
getting
into
touch
with
the
rest
of
his
it
is
the
part
of
laughter
to
reprove
his
absentmindedness
and
wake
him
out
of
his
dream
if
it
is
permissible
to
compare
important
things
with
trivial
ones
we
would
call
to
mind
what
happens
when
a
youth
enters
one
of
our
military
academies
after
getting
through
the
dreaded
ordeal
of
the
examination
he
finds
the
has
other
ordeals
to
face
which
his
seniors
have
arranged
with
the
object
of
fitting
him
for
the
new
life
he
is
entering
upon
or
as
they
say
of
breaking
him
into
harness
every
small
society
that
forms
within
the
larger
is
thus
impelled
by
a
vague
kind
of
instinct
to
devise
some
method
of
discipline
or
breaking
in
so
as
to
deal
with
the
rigidity
of
habits
that
have
been
formed
elsewhere
and
have
now
to
undergo
a
partial
modification
society
properly
proceeds
in
exactly
the
same
way
each
member
must
be
ever
attentive
to
his
social
surroundings
he
must
model
himself
on
his
environment
in
short
he
must
avoid
shutting
himself
up
in
his
own
peculiar
character
as
a
philosopher
in
his
ivory
tower
therefore
society
holds
suspended
over
each
individual
member
if
not
the
threat
of
correction
at
all
events
the
prospect
of
a
snubbing
which
although
it
is
slight
is
none
the
less
dreaded
such
must
be
the
function
of
laughter
always
rather
humiliating
for
the
one
against
whom
it
is
directed
laughter
is
really
and
truly
a
kind
of
social
ragging
hence
the
equivocal
nature
of
the
comic
it
belongs
neither
altogether
to
art
nor
altogether
to
life
on
the
one
hand
characters
in
real
life
would
never
make
us
laugh
were
we
not
capable
of
watching
their
vagaries
in
the
same
way
as
we
look
down
at
a
play
from
our
seat
in
a
box
they
are
only
comic
in
our
eyes
because
they
perform
a
kind
of
comedy
before
us
but
on
the
other
hand
the
pleasure
caused
by
laughter
even
on
the
stage
is
not
an
unadulterated
enjoyment
it
is
not
a
pleasure
that
is
exclusively
esthetic
or
altogether
disinterested
it
always
implies
a
secret
or
unconscious
intent
if
not
of
each
one
of
us
at
all
events
of
society
as
a
whole
in
laughter
we
always
find
an
unavowed
intention
to
humiliate
and
consequently
to
correct
our
neighbour
if
not
in
his
will
at
least
in
his
deed
this
is
the
reason
a
comedy
is
far
more
like
real
life
than
a
drama
is
the
more
sublime
the
drama
the
more
profound
the
analysis
to
which
the
poet
has
had
to
subject
the
raw
materials
of
daily
life
in
order
to
obtain
the
tragic
element
in
its
unadulterated
form
on
the
contrary
it
is
only
in
its
lower
aspects
in
light
comedy
and
farce
that
comedy
is
in
striking
contrast
to
reality
the
higher
it
rises
the
more
it
approximates
to
life
in
fact
there
are
scenes
in
real
life
so
closely
bordering
on
comedy
that
the
stage
might
adopt
them
without
changing
a
single
word
hence
it
follows
that
the
elements
of
comic
character
on
the
stage
and
in
actual
life
will
be
the
same
what
are
these
elements
we
shall
find
no
difficulty
in
deducing
them
it
has
often
been
said
that
it
is
the
trifling
faults
of
our
that
make
us
laugh
evidently
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
truth
in
this
opinion
still
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
altogether
correct
first
as
regards
faults
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
draw
the
line
between
the
trifling
and
the
serious
maybe
it
is
not
because
a
fault
is
trifling
that
it
makes
us
laugh
but
rather
because
it
makes
us
laugh
that
we
regard
it
as
trifling
for
there
is
nothing
disarms
us
like
laughter
but
we
may
go
even
farther
and
maintain
that
there
are
faults
at
which
we
laugh
even
though
fully
aware
that
they
are
serious
harpagon
avarice
for
instance
and
then
we
may
as
well
confess
though
somewhat
reluctantly
that
we
laugh
not
only
at
the
faults
of
our
but
also
at
times
at
their
good
qualities
we
laugh
at
alceste
the
objection
may
be
urged
that
it
is
not
the
earnestness
of
alceste
that
is
ludicrous
but
rather
the
special
aspect
which
earnestness
assumes
in
his
case
and
in
short
a
certain
eccentricity
that
mars
it
in
our
eyes
agreed
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
this
eccentricity
in
alceste
at
which
we
laugh
makes
his
earnestness
laughable
and
that
is
the
main
point
so
we
may
conclude
that
the
ludicrous
is
not
always
an
indication
of
a
fault
in
the
moral
meaning
of
the
word
and
if
critics
insist
on
seeing
a
fault
even
though
a
trifling
one
in
the
ludicrous
they
must
point
out
what
it
is
here
that
exactly
distinguishes
the
trifling
from
the
serious
the
truth
is
the
comic
character
may
strictly
speaking
be
quite
in
accord
with
stern
morality
all
it
has
to
do
is
to
bring
itself
into
accord
with
society
the
character
of
alceste
is
that
of
a
thoroughly
honest
man
but
then
he
is
unsociable
and
on
that
very
account
ludicrous
a
flexible
vice
may
not
be
so
easy
to
ridicule
as
a
rigid
virtue
it
is
rigidity
that
society
eyes
with
suspicion
consequently
it
is
the
rigidity
of
alceste
that
makes
us
laugh
though
here
rigidity
stands
for
honesty
the
man
who
withdraws
into
himself
is
liable
to
ridicule
because
the
comic
is
largely
made
up
of
this
very
withdrawal
this
accounts
for
the
comic
being
so
frequently
dependent
on
the
manners
or
ideas
or
to
put
it
bluntly
on
the
prejudices
of
a
society
it
must
be
acknowledged
however
to
the
credit
of
mankind
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
the
social
ideal
and
the
rule
that
it
is
the
faults
of
others
that
make
us
laugh
provided
we
add
that
they
make
us
laugh
by
reason
of
their
unsociability
rather
than
of
their
immorality
what
then
are
the
faults
capable
of
becoming
ludicrous
and
in
what
circumstances
do
we
regard
them
as
being
too
serious
to
be
laughed
at
we
have
already
given
an
implicit
answer
to
this
question
the
comic
we
said
appeals
to
the
intelligence
pure
and
simple
laughter
is
incompatible
with
emotion
depict
some
fault
however
trifling
in
such
a
way
as
to
arouse
sympathy
fear
or
pity
the
mischief
is
done
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
laugh
on
the
other
hand
take
a
downright
vice
even
one
that
is
generally
speaking
of
an
odious
nature
you
may
make
it
ludicrous
if
by
some
suitable
contrivance
you
arrange
so
that
it
leaves
our
emotions
unaffected
not
that
the
vice
must
then
be
ludicrous
but
it
may
from
that
time
forth
become
so
it
must
not
arouse
our
feelings
that
is
the
sole
condition
really
necessary
though
assuredly
it
is
not
sufficient
but
then
how
will
the
comic
poet
set
to
work
to
prevent
our
feelings
being
moved
the
question
is
an
embarrassing
one
to
clear
it
up
thoroughly
we
should
have
to
enter
upon
a
rather
novel
line
of
investigation
to
analyse
the
artificial
sympathy
which
we
bring
with
us
to
the
theatre
and
determine
upon
the
circumstances
in
which
we
accept
and
those
in
which
we
refuse
to
share
imaginary
joys
and
sorrows
there
is
an
art
of
lulling
sensibility
to
sleep
and
providing
it
with
dreams
as
happens
in
the
case
of
a
mesmerised
person
and
there
is
also
an
art
of
throwing
a
wet
blanket
upon
sympathy
at
the
very
moment
it
might
arise
the
result
being
that
the
situation
though
a
serious
one
is
not
taken
seriously
this
latter
art
would
appear
to
be
governed
by
two
methods
which
are
applied
more
or
less
unconsciously
by
the
comic
poet
the
first
consists
in
isolating
within
the
soul
of
the
character
the
feeling
attributed
to
him
and
making
it
a
parasitic
organism
so
to
speak
endowed
with
an
independent
existence
as
a
general
rule
an
intense
feeling
successively
encroaches
upon
all
other
mental
states
and
colours
them
with
its
own
peculiar
hue
if
then
we
are
made
to
witness
this
gradual
impregnation
we
finally
become
impregnated
ourselves
with
a
corresponding
emotion
to
employ
a
different
image
an
emotion
may
be
said
to
be
dramatic
and
contagious
when
all
the
harmonics
in
it
are
heard
along
with
the
fundamental
note
it
is
because
the
actor
thus
thrills
throughout
his
whole
being
that
the
spectators
themselves
feel
the
thrill
on
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
emotion
that
leaves
us
indifferent
and
that
is
about
to
become
comic
there
is
always
present
a
certain
rigidity
which
prevents
it
from
establishing
a
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
soul
in
which
it
has
taken
up
its
abode
this
rigidity
may
be
manifested
when
the
time
comes
by
movements
and
then
it
will
provoke
laughter
but
before
that
it
had
already
alienated
our
sympathy
how
can
we
put
ourselves
in
tune
with
a
soul
which
is
not
in
tune
with
itself
in
moliere
we
have
a
scene
bordering
upon
drama
it
is
the
one
in
which
the
borrower
and
the
usurer
who
have
never
seen
each
other
meet
face
to
face
and
find
that
they
are
son
and
father
here
we
should
be
in
the
thick
of
a
drama
if
only
greed
and
fatherly
affection
conflicting
with
each
other
in
the
soul
of
harpagon
had
effected
a
more
or
less
original
combination
but
such
is
not
the
case
no
sooner
has
the
interview
come
to
an
end
than
the
father
forgets
everything
on
meeting
his
son
again
he
barely
alludes
to
the
scene
serious
though
it
has
been
you
my
son
whom
i
am
good
enough
to
forgive
your
recent
escapade
etc
greed
has
thus
passed
close
to
all
other
feelings
absentmindedly
without
either
touching
them
or
being
touched
although
it
has
taken
up
its
abode
in
the
soul
and
become
master
of
the
house
none
the
less
it
remains
a
stranger
far
different
would
be
avarice
of
a
tragic
sort
we
should
find
it
attracting
and
absorbing
transforming
and
assimilating
the
divers
energies
of
the
man
feelings
and
affections
likes
and
dislikes
vices
and
virtues
would
all
become
something
into
which
avarice
would
breathe
a
new
kind
of
life
such
seems
to
be
the
first
essential
difference
between
comedy
and
drama
there
is
a
second
which
is
far
more
obvious
and
arises
out
of
the
first
when
a
mental
state
is
depicted
to
us
with
the
object
of
making
it
dramatic
or
even
merely
of
inducing
us
to
take
it
seriously
it
gradually
crystallises
into
actions
which
provide
the
real
measure
of
its
greatness
thus
the
miser
orders
his
whole
life
with
a
view
to
acquiring
wealth
and
the
pious
hypocrite
though
pretending
to
have
his
eyes
fixed
upon
heaven
steers
most
skilfully
his
course
here
below
most
certainly
comedy
does
not
shut
out
calculations
of
this
kind
we
need
only
take
as
an
example
the
very
machinations
of
tartuffe
but
that
is
what
comedy
has
in
common
with
drama
and
in
order
to
keep
distinct
from
it
to
prevent
our
taking
a
serious
action
seriously
in
short
in
order
to
prepare
us
for
laughter
comedy
utilises
a
method
the
formula
of
which
may
be
given
as
follows
instead
of
concentrating
our
attention
on
actions
comedy
directs
it
rather
to
gestures
by
gestures
we
here
mean
the
attitudes
the
movements
and
even
the
language
by
which
a
mental
state
expresses
itself
outwardly
without
any
aim
or
profit
from
no
other
cause
than
a
kind
of
inner
itching
gesture
thus
defined
is
profoundly
different
from
action
action
is
intentional
or
at
any
rate
conscious
gesture
slips
out
unawares
it
is
automatic
in
action
the
entire
person
is
engaged
in
gesture
an
isolated
part
of
the
person
is
expressed
unknown
to
or
at
least
apart
from
the
whole
of
the
personality
lastly
and
here
is
the
essential
point
action
is
in
exact
proportion
to
the
feeling
that
inspires
it
the
one
gradually
passes
into
the
other
so
that
we
may
allow
our
sympathy
or
our
aversion
to
glide
along
the
line
running
from
feeling
to
action
and
become
increasingly
interested
about
gesture
however
there
is
something
explosive
which
awakes
our
sensibility
when
on
the
point
of
being
lulled
to
sleep
and
by
thus
rousing
us
up
prevents
our
taking
matters
seriously
thus
as
soon
as
our
attention
is
fixed
on
gesture
and
not
on
action
we
are
in
the
realm
of
comedy
did
we
merely
take
his
actions
into
account
tartuffe
would
belong
to
drama
it
is
only
when
we
take
his
gestures
into
consideration
that
we
find
him
comic
you
may
remember
how
he
comes
on
to
the
stage
with
the
words
laurent
lock
up
my
and
my
scourge
he
knows
dorine
is
listening
to
him
but
doubtless
he
would
say
the
same
if
she
were
not
there
he
enters
so
thoroughly
into
the
role
of
a
hypocrite
that
he
plays
it
almost
sincerely
in
this
way
and
this
way
only
can
he
become
comic
were
it
not
for
this
material
sincerity
were
it
not
for
the
language
and
attitudes
that
his
experience
as
a
hypocrite
has
transformed
into
natural
gestures
tartuffe
would
be
simply
odious
because
we
should
only
think
of
what
is
meant
and
willed
in
his
conduct
and
so
we
see
why
action
is
essential
in
drama
but
only
accessory
in
comedy
in
a
comedy
we
feel
any
other
situation
might
equally
well
have
been
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
the
character
he
would
still
have
been
the
same
man
though
the
situation
were
different
but
we
do
not
get
this
impression
in
a
drama
here
characters
and
situations
are
welded
together
or
rather
events
form
part
and
parcel
with
the
persons
so
that
were
the
drama
to
tell
us
a
different
story
even
though
the
actors
kept
the
same
names
we
should
in
reality
be
dealing
with
other
persons
to
sum
up
whether
a
character
is
good
or
bad
is
of
little
moment
granted
he
is
unsociable
he
is
capable
of
becoming
comic
we
now
see
that
the
seriousness
of
the
case
is
of
no
importance
either
whether
serious
or
trifling
it
is
still
capable
of
making
us
laugh
provided
that
care
be
taken
not
to
arouse
our
emotions
unsociability
in
the
performer
and
insensibility
in
the
spectator
such
in
a
word
are
the
two
essential
conditions
there
is
a
third
implicit
in
the
other
two
which
so
far
it
has
been
the
aim
of
our
analysis
to
bring
out
this
third
condition
is
automatism
we
have
pointed
it
out
from
the
outset
of
this
work
continually
drawing
attention
to
the
following
point
what
is
essentially
laughable
is
what
is
done
automatically
in
a
vice
even
in
a
virtue
the
comic
is
that
element
by
which
the
person
unwittingly
betrays
himself
the
involuntary
gesture
or
the
unconscious
remark
absentmindedness
is
always
comical
indeed
the
deeper
the
absentmindedness
the
higher
the
comedy
systematic
absentmindedness
like
that
of
don
quixote
is
the
most
comical
thing
imaginable
it
is
the
comic
itself
drawn
as
nearly
as
possible
from
its
very
source
take
any
other
comic
character
however
unconscious
he
may
be
of
what
he
says
or
does
he
can
not
be
comical
unless
there
be
some
aspect
of
his
person
of
which
he
is
unaware
one
side
of
his
nature
which
he
overlooks
on
that
account
alone
does
he
make
us
laugh
footnote
when
the
humorist
laughs
at
himself
he
is
really
acting
a
double
part
the
self
who
laughs
is
indeed
conscious
but
not
the
self
who
is
laughed
at
profoundly
comic
sayings
are
those
artless
ones
in
which
some
vice
reveals
itself
in
all
its
nakedness
how
could
it
thus
expose
itself
were
it
capable
of
seeing
itself
as
it
is
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
comic
character
to
condemn
in
general
terms
a
certain
line
of
conduct
and
immediately
afterwards
afford
an
example
of
it
himself
for
instance
jourdain
teacher
of
philosophy
flying
into
a
passion
after
inveighing
against
anger
vadius
taking
a
poem
from
his
pocket
after
heaping
ridicule
on
readers
of
poetry
etc
what
is
the
object
of
such
contradictions
except
to
help
us
to
put
our
finger
on
the
obliviousness
of
the
characters
to
their
own
actions
inattention
to
self
and
consequently
to
others
is
what
we
invariably
find
and
if
we
look
at
the
matter
closely
we
see
that
inattention
is
here
equivalent
to
what
we
have
called
unsociability
the
chief
cause
of
rigidity
is
the
neglect
to
look
around
and
more
especially
within
oneself
how
can
a
man
fashion
his
personality
after
that
of
another
if
he
does
not
first
study
others
as
well
as
himself
rigidity
automatism
and
unsociability
are
all
inextricably
entwined
and
all
serve
as
ingredients
to
the
making
up
of
the
comic
in
character
in
a
word
if
we
leave
on
one
side
when
dealing
with
human
personality
that
portion
which
interests
our
sensibility
or
appeals
to
our
feeling
all
the
rest
is
capable
of
becoming
comic
and
the
comic
will
be
proportioned
to
the
rigidity
we
formulated
this
idea
at
the
outset
of
this
work
we
have
verified
it
in
its
main
results
and
have
just
applied
it
to
the
definition
of
comedy
now
we
must
get
to
closer
quarters
and
show
how
it
enables
us
to
delimitate
the
exact
position
comedy
occupies
among
all
the
other
arts
in
one
sense
it
might
be
said
that
all
character
is
comic
provided
we
mean
by
character
the
element
in
our
personality
that
mechanical
element
which
resembles
a
piece
of
clockwork
wound
up
once
for
all
and
capable
of
working
automatically
it
is
if
you
will
that
which
causes
us
to
imitate
ourselves
and
it
is
also
for
that
very
reason
that
which
enables
others
to
imitate
us
every
comic
character
is
a
type
inversely
every
resemblance
to
a
type
has
something
comic
in
it
though
we
may
long
have
associated
with
an
individual
without
discovering
anything
about
him
to
laugh
at
still
if
advantage
is
t
taken
of
some
accidental
analogy
to
dub
him
with
the
name
of
a
famous
hero
of
romance
or
drama
he
will
in
our
eyes
border
upon
the
ridiculous
if
only
for
a
moment
and
yet
this
hero
of
romance
may
not
be
a
comic
character
at
all
but
then
it
is
comic
to
be
like
him
it
is
comic
to
wander
out
of
one
own
self
it
is
comic
to
fall
into
a
category
and
what
is
most
comic
of
all
is
to
become
a
category
oneself
into
which
others
will
fall
as
into
a
frame
it
is
to
crystallise
into
a
stock
character
thus
to
depict
characters
that
is
to
say
general
types
is
the
object
of
comedy
this
has
often
been
said
but
it
is
as
well
to
repeat
it
since
there
could
be
no
better
definition
of
comedy
not
only
are
we
entitled
to
say
that
comedy
gives
us
general
types
but
we
might
add
that
it
is
the
only
one
of
all
the
arts
that
aims
at
the
general
so
that
once
this
objective
has
been
attributed
to
it
we
have
said
all
that
it
is
and
all
that
the
rest
can
not
be
to
prove
that
such
is
really
the
essence
of
comedy
and
that
it
is
in
this
respect
opposed
to
tragedy
drama
and
the
other
forms
of
art
we
should
begin
by
defining
art
in
its
higher
forms
then
gradually
coming
down
to
comic
poetry
we
should
find
that
this
latter
is
situated
on
the
between
art
and
life
and
that
by
the
generality
of
its
it
contrasts
with
the
rest
of
the
arts
we
can
not
here
plunge
into
so
vast
a
subject
of
investigation
but
we
needs
must
sketch
its
main
outlines
lest
we
overlook
what
to
our
mind
is
essential
on
the
comic
stage
what
is
the
object
of
art
could
reality
come
into
direct
contact
with
sense
and
consciousness
could
we
enter
into
immediate
communion
with
things
and
with
ourselves
probably
art
would
be
useless
or
rather
we
should
all
be
artists
for
then
our
soul
would
continually
vibrate
in
perfect
accord
with
nature
our
eyes
aided
by
memory
would
carve
out
in
space
and
fix
in
time
the
most
inimitable
of
pictures
hewn
in
the
living
marble
of
the
human
form
fragments
of
statues
beautiful
as
the
relics
of
antique
statuary
would
strike
the
passing
glance
deep
in
our
souls
we
should
hear
the
strains
of
our
inner
life
unbroken
melody
a
music
that
is
ofttimes
gay
but
more
frequently
plaintive
and
always
original
all
this
is
around
and
within
us
and
yet
no
whit
of
it
do
we
distinctly
perceive
between
nature
and
ourselves
nay
between
ourselves
and
our
own
consciousness
a
veil
is
interposed
a
veil
that
is
dense
and
opaque
for
the
common
herd
thin
almost
transparent
for
the
artist
and
the
poet
what
fairy
wove
that
veil
was
it
done
in
malice
or
in
friendliness
we
had
to
live
and
life
demands
that
we
grasp
things
in
their
relations
to
our
own
needs
life
is
action
life
implies
the
acceptance
only
of
the
utilitarian
side
of
things
in
order
to
respond
to
them
by
appropriate
reactions
all
other
impressions
must
be
dimmed
or
else
reach
us
vague
and
blurred
i
look
and
i
think
i
see
i
listen
and
i
think
i
hear
i
examine
myself
and
i
think
i
am
reading
the
very
depths
of
my
heart
but
what
i
see
and
hear
of
the
outer
world
is
purely
and
simply
a
selection
made
by
my
senses
to
serve
as
a
light
to
my
conduct
what
i
know
of
myself
is
what
comes
to
the
surface
what
participates
in
my
actions
my
senses
and
my
consciousness
therefore
give
me
no
more
than
a
practical
simplification
of
reality
in
the
vision
they
furnish
me
of
myself
and
of
things
the
differences
that
are
useless
to
man
are
obliterated
the
resemblances
that
are
useful
to
him
are
emphasised
ways
are
traced
out
for
me
in
advance
along
which
my
activity
is
to
travel
these
ways
are
the
ways
which
all
mankind
has
trod
before
me
things
have
been
classified
with
a
view
to
the
use
i
can
derive
from
them
and
it
is
this
classification
i
perceive
far
more
clearly
than
the
colour
and
the
shape
of
things
doubtless
man
is
vastly
superior
to
the
lower
animals
in
this
respect
it
is
not
very
likely
that
the
eye
of
a
wolf
makes
any
distinction
between
a
kid
and
a
lamb
both
appear
t
o
the
wolf
as
the
same
identical
quarry
alike
easy
to
pounce
upon
alike
good
to
devour
we
for
our
part
make
a
distinction
between
a
goat
and
a
sheep
but
can
we
tell
one
goat
from
another
one
sheep
from
another
the
individuality
of
things
or
of
beings
escapes
us
unless
it
is
materially
to
our
advantage
to
perceive
it
even
when
we
do
take
note
of
it
as
when
we
distinguish
one
man
from
another
it
is
not
the
individuality
itself
that
the
eye
grasps
an
entirely
original
harmony
of
forms
and
colours
but
only
one
or
two
features
that
will
make
practical
recognition
easier
in
short
we
do
not
see
the
actual
things
themselves
in
most
cases
we
confine
ourselves
to
reading
the
labels
affixed
to
them
this
tendency
the
result
of
need
has
become
even
more
pronounced
under
the
influence
of
speech
for
words
with
the
exception
of
proper
nouns
all
denote
genera
the
word
which
only
takes
note
of
the
most
ordinary
function
and
commonplace
aspect
of
the
thing
intervenes
between
it
and
ourselves
and
would
conceal
its
form
from
our
eyes
were
that
form
not
already
masked
beneath
the
necessities
that
brought
the
word
into
existence
not
only
external
objects
but
even
our
own
mental
states
are
screened
from
us
in
their
inmost
their
personal
aspect
in
the
original
life
they
possess
when
we
feel
love
or
hatred
when
we
are
gay
or
sad
is
it
really
the
feeling
itself
that
reaches
our
consciousness
with
those
innumerable
fleeting
shades
of
meaning
and
deep
resounding
echoes
that
make
it
something
altogether
our
own
we
should
all
were
it
so
be
novelists
or
poets
or
musicians
mostly
however
we
perceive
nothing
but
the
outward
display
of
our
mental
state
we
catch
only
the
impersonal
aspect
of
our
feelings
that
aspect
which
speech
has
set
down
once
for
all
because
it
is
almost
the
same
in
the
same
conditions
for
all
men
thus
even
in
our
own
individual
individuality
escapes
our
ken
we
move
amidst
generalities
and
symbols
as
within
a
in
which
our
force
is
effectively
pitted
against
other
forces
and
fascinated
by
action
tempted
by
it
for
our
own
good
on
to
the
field
it
has
selected
we
live
in
a
zone
midway
between
things
and
ourselves
externally
to
things
externally
also
to
ourselves
from
time
to
time
however
in
a
fit
of
absentmindedness
nature
raises
up
souls
that
are
more
detached
from
life
not
with
that
intentional
logical
systematical
detachment
the
result
of
reflection
and
philosophy
but
rather
with
natural
detachment
one
innate
in
the
structure
of
sense
or
consciousness
which
at
once
reveals
itself
by
a
virginal
manner
so
to
speak
of
seeing
hearing
or
thinking
were
this
detachment
complete
did
the
soul
no
longer
cleave
to
action
by
any
of
its
perceptions
it
would
be
the
soul
of
an
artist
such
as
the
world
has
never
yet
seen
it
would
excel
alike
in
every
art
at
the
same
time
or
rather
it
would
fuse
them
all
into
one
it
would
perceive
all
things
in
their
native
purity
the
forms
colours
sounds
of
the
physical
world
as
well
as
the
subtlest
movements
of
the
inner
life
but
this
is
asking
too
much
of
nature
even
for
such
of
us
as
she
has
made
artists
it
is
by
accident
and
on
one
side
only
that
she
has
lifted
the
veil
in
one
direction
only
has
she
forgotten
to
rivet
the
perception
to
the
need
and
since
each
direction
corresponds
to
what
we
call
a
sense
through
one
of
his
senses
and
through
that
sense
alone
is
the
artist
usually
wedded
to
art
hence
originally
the
diversity
of
arts
hence
also
the
speciality
of
predispositions
this
one
applies
himself
to
colours
and
forms
and
since
he
loves
colour
for
colour
and
form
for
form
since
he
perceives
them
for
their
sake
and
not
for
his
own
it
is
the
inner
life
of
things
that
he
sees
appearing
through
their
forms
and
colours
little
by
little
he
insinuates
it
into
our
own
perception
baffled
though
we
may
be
at
the
outset
for
a
few
moments
at
least
he
diverts
us
from
the
prejudices
of
form
and
colour
that
come
between
ourselves
and
reality
and
thus
he
realises
the
loftiest
ambition
of
art
which
here
consists
in
revealing
to
us
nature
others
again
retire
within
themselves
beneath
the
thousand
rudimentary
actions
which
are
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
an
emotion
behind
the
commonplace
conventional
expression
that
both
reveals
and
conceals
an
individual
mental
state
it
is
the
emotion
the
original
mood
to
which
they
attain
in
its
undefiled
essence
and
then
to
induce
us
to
make
the
same
effort
ourselves
they
contrive
to
make
us
see
something
of
what
they
have
seen
by
rhythmical
arrangement
of
words
which
thus
become
organised
and
animated
with
a
life
of
their
own
they
tell
us
or
rather
suggest
things
that
speech
was
not
calculated
to
express
others
delve
yet
deeper
still
beneath
these
joys
and
sorrows
which
can
at
a
pinch
be
translated
into
language
they
grasp
something
that
has
nothing
in
common
with
language
certain
rhythms
of
life
and
breath
that
are
closer
to
man
than
his
inmost
feelings
being
the
living
law
varying
with
each
individual
of
his
enthusiasm
and
despair
his
hopes
and
regrets
by
setting
free
and
emphasising
this
music
they
force
it
upon
our
attention
they
compel
us
to
fall
in
with
it
like
who
join
in
a
dance
and
thus
they
impel
us
to
set
in
motion
in
the
depths
of
our
being
some
secret
chord
which
was
only
waiting
to
thrill
so
art
whether
it
be
painting
or
sculpture
poetry
or
music
has
no
other
object
than
to
brush
aside
the
utilitarian
symbols
the
conventional
and
socially
accepted
generalities
in
short
everything
that
veils
reality
from
us
in
order
to
bring
us
face
to
face
with
reality
itself
it
is
from
a
misunderstanding
on
this
point
that
the
dispute
between
realism
and
idealism
in
art
has
arisen
art
is
certainly
only
a
more
direct
vision
of
reality
but
this
purity
of
perception
implies
a
break
with
utilitarian
convention
an
innate
and
specially
localised
disinterestedness
of
sense
or
consciousness
in
short
a
certain
immateriality
of
life
which
is
what
has
always
been
called
idealism
so
that
we
might
say
without
in
any
way
playing
upon
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
realism
is
in
the
work
when
idealism
is
in
the
soul
and
that
it
is
only
through
ideality
that
we
can
resume
contact
with
reality
dramatic
art
forms
no
exception
to
this
law
what
drama
goes
forth
to
discover
and
brings
to
light
is
a
reality
that
is
veiled
from
us
often
in
our
own
interests
by
the
necessities
of
life
what
is
this
reality
what
are
these
necessities
poetry
always
expresses
inward
states
but
amongst
these
states
some
arise
mainly
from
contact
with
our
they
are
the
most
intense
as
well
as
the
most
violent
as
contrary
electricities
attract
each
other
and
accumulate
between
the
two
plates
of
the
condenser
from
which
the
spark
will
presently
flash
so
by
simply
bringing
people
together
strong
attractions
and
repulsions
take
place
followed
by
an
utter
loss
of
balance
in
a
word
by
that
electrification
of
the
soul
known
as
passion
were
man
to
give
way
to
the
impulse
of
his
natural
feelings
were
there
neither
social
nor
moral
law
these
outbursts
of
violent
feeling
would
be
the
ordinary
rule
in
life
but
utility
demands
that
these
outbursts
should
be
foreseen
and
averted
man
must
live
in
society
and
consequently
submit
to
rules
and
what
interest
advises
reason
commands
duty
calls
and
we
have
to
obey
the
summons
under
this
dual
influence
has
perforce
been
formed
an
outward
layer
of
feelings
and
ideas
which
make
for
permanence
aim
at
becoming
common
to
all
men
and
cover
when
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
extinguish
it
the
inner
fire
of
individual
passions
the
slow
progress
of
mankind
in
the
direction
of
an
increasingly
peaceful
social
life
has
gradually
consolidated
this
layer
just
as
the
life
of
our
planet
itself
has
been
one
long
effort
to
cover
over
with
a
cool
and
solid
crust
the
fiery
mass
of
seething
metals
but
volcanic
eruptions
occur
and
if
the
earth
were
a
living
being
as
mythology
has
feigned
most
likely
when
in
repose
it
would
take
delight
in
dreaming
of
these
sudden
explosions
whereby
it
suddenly
resumes
possession
of
its
innermost
nature
such
is
just
the
kind
of
pleasure
that
is
provided
for
us
by
drama
beneath
the
quiet
humdrum
life
that
reason
and
society
have
fashioned
for
us
it
stirs
something
within
us
which
luckily
does
not
explode
but
which
it
makes
us
feel
in
its
inner
tension
it
offers
nature
her
revenge
upon
society
sometimes
it
makes
straight
for
the
goal
summoning
up
to
the
surface
from
the
depths
below
passions
that
produce
a
general
upheaval
sometimes
it
effects
a
flank
movement
as
is
often
the
case
in
contemporary
drama
with
a
skill
that
is
frequently
sophistical
it
shows
up
the
inconsistencies
of
society
it
exaggerates
the
shams
and
shibboleths
of
the
social
law
and
so
indirectly
by
merely
dissolving
or
corroding
the
outer
crust
it
again
brings
us
back
to
the
inner
core
but
in
both
cases
whether
it
weakens
society
or
strengthens
nature
it
has
the
same
end
in
view
that
of
laying
bare
a
secret
portion
of
ourselves
what
might
be
called
the
tragic
element
in
our
character
this
is
indeed
the
impression
we
get
after
seeing
a
stirring
drama
what
has
just
interested
us
is
not
so
much
what
we
have
been
told
about
others
as
the
glimpse
we
have
caught
of
ourselves
a
whole
host
of
ghostly
feelings
emotions
and
events
that
would
fain
have
come
into
real
existence
but
fortunately
for
us
did
not
it
also
seems
as
if
an
appeal
had
been
made
within
us
to
certain
ancestral
memories
belonging
to
a
past
memories
so
and
so
foreign
to
our
present
life
that
this
latter
for
a
moment
seems
something
unreal
and
conventional
for
which
we
shall
have
to
serve
a
fresh
apprenticeship
so
it
is
indeed
a
deeper
reality
that
drama
draws
up
from
beneath
our
superficial
and
utilitarian
attainments
and
this
art
has
the
same
end
in
view
as
all
the
others
hence
it
follows
that
art
always
aims
at
what
is
individual
what
the
artist
fixes
on
his
canvas
is
something
he
has
seen
at
a
certain
spot
on
a
certain
day
at
a
certain
hour
with
a
colouring
that
will
never
be
seen
again
what
the
poet
sings
of
is
a
certain
mood
which
was
his
and
his
alone
and
which
will
never
return
what
the
dramatist
unfolds
before
us
is
the
of
a
soul
a
living
tissue
of
feelings
and
events
something
in
short
which
has
once
happened
and
can
never
be
repeated
we
may
indeed
give
general
names
to
these
feelings
but
they
can
not
be
the
same
thing
in
another
soul
they
are
individualised
thereby
and
thereby
only
do
they
belong
to
art
for
generalities
symbols
or
even
types
form
the
current
coin
of
our
daily
perception
how
then
does
a
misunderstanding
on
this
point
arise
the
reason
lies
in
the
fact
that
two
very
different
things
have
been
mistaken
for
each
other
the
generality
of
things
and
that
of
the
opinions
we
come
to
regarding
them
because
a
feeling
is
generally
recognised
as
true
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
a
general
feeling
nothing
could
be
more
unique
than
the
character
of
hamlet
though
he
may
resemble
other
men
in
some
respects
it
is
clearly
not
on
that
account
that
he
interests
us
most
but
he
is
universally
accepted
and
regarded
as
a
living
character
in
this
sense
only
is
he
universally
true
the
same
holds
good
of
all
the
other
products
of
art
each
of
them
is
unique
and
yet
if
it
bear
the
stamp
of
genius
it
will
come
to
be
accepted
by
everybody
why
will
it
be
accepted
and
if
it
is
unique
of
its
kind
by
what
sign
do
we
know
it
to
be
genuine
evidently
by
the
very
effort
it
forces
us
to
make
against
our
predispositions
in
order
to
see
sincerely
sincerity
is
contagious
what
the
artist
has
seen
we
shall
probably
never
see
again
or
at
least
never
see
in
exactly
the
same
way
but
if
he
has
actually
seen
it
the
attempt
he
has
made
to
lift
the
veil
compels
our
imitation
his
work
is
an
example
which
we
take
as
a
lesson
and
the
efficacy
of
the
lesson
is
the
exact
standard
of
the
genuineness
of
the
work
consequently
truth
bears
within
itself
a
power
of
conviction
nay
of
conversion
which
is
the
sign
that
enables
us
to
recognise
it
the
greater
the
work
and
the
more
profound
the
dimly
apprehended
truth
the
longer
may
the
effect
be
in
coming
but
on
the
other
hand
the
more
universal
will
that
effect
tend
to
become
so
the
universality
here
lies
in
the
effect
produced
and
not
in
the
cause
altogether
different
is
the
object
of
comedy
here
it
is
in
the
work
itself
that
the
generality
lies
comedy
depicts
characters
we
have
already
come
across
and
shall
meet
with
again
it
takes
note
of
similarities
it
aims
at
placing
types
before
our
eyes
it
even
creates
new
types
if
necessary
in
this
respect
it
forms
a
contrast
to
all
the
other
arts
the
very
titles
of
certain
classical
comedies
are
significant
in
themselves

distrait
are
names
of
whole
classes
of
people
and
even
when
a
character
comedy
has
a
proper
noun
as
its
title
this
proper
noun
is
speedily
swept
away
by
the
very
weight
of
its
contents
into
the
stream
of
common
nouns
we
say
a
tartuffe
but
we
should
never
say
a
phedre
or
a
polyeucte
above
all
a
tragic
poet
will
never
think
of
grouping
around
the
chief
character
in
his
play
secondary
characters
to
serve
as
simplified
copies
so
to
speak
of
the
former
the
hero
of
a
tragedy
represents
an
individuality
unique
of
its
kind
it
may
be
possible
to
imitate
him
but
then
we
shall
be
passing
whether
consciously
or
not
from
the
tragic
to
the
comic
no
one
is
like
him
because
he
is
like
no
one
but
a
remarkable
instinct
on
the
contrary
impels
the
comic
poet
once
he
has
elaborated
his
central
character
to
cause
other
characters
displaying
the
same
general
traits
to
revolve
as
satellites
round
him
many
comedies
have
either
a
plural
noun
or
some
collective
term
as
their
title
les
femmes
savantes
les
precieuses
ridicules
le
monde
ou
represent
so
many
rallying
points
on
the
stage
adopted
by
different
groups
of
characters
all
belonging
to
one
identical
type
it
would
be
interesting
to
analyse
this
tendency
in
comedy
maybe
dramatists
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fact
recently
brought
forward
by
mental
pathology
viz
that
cranks
of
the
same
kind
are
drawn
by
a
secret
attraction
to
seek
each
other
company
without
precisely
coming
within
the
province
of
medicine
the
comic
individual
as
we
have
shown
is
in
some
way
absentminded
and
the
transition
from
to
crankiness
is
continuous
but
there
is
also
another
reason
if
the
comic
poet
object
is
to
offer
us
types
that
is
to
say
characters
capable
of
how
can
he
set
about
it
better
than
by
showing
us
in
each
instance
several
different
copies
of
the
same
model
that
is
just
what
the
naturalist
does
in
order
to
define
a
species
he
enumerates
and
describes
its
main
varieties
this
essential
difference
between
tragedy
and
comedy
the
former
being
concerned
with
individuals
and
the
latter
with
classes
is
revealed
in
yet
another
way
it
appears
in
the
first
draft
of
the
work
from
the
outset
it
is
manifested
by
two
radically
different
methods
of
observation
though
the
assertion
may
seem
paradoxical
a
study
of
other
men
is
probably
not
necessary
to
the
tragic
poet
we
find
some
of
the
great
poets
have
lived
a
retiring
homely
sort
of
life
without
having
a
chance
of
witnessing
around
them
an
outburst
of
the
passions
they
have
so
faithfully
depicted
but
supposing
even
they
had
witnessed
such
a
spectacle
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
would
have
found
it
of
much
use
for
what
interests
us
in
the
work
of
the
poet
is
the
glimpse
we
get
of
certain
profound
moods
or
inner
struggles
now
this
glimpse
can
not
be
obtained
from
without
our
souls
are
impenetrable
to
one
another
certain
signs
of
passion
are
all
that
we
ever
apperceive
externally
these
we
interpret
though
always
by
the
way
defectively
only
by
analogy
with
what
we
have
ourselves
experienced
so
what
we
experience
is
the
main
point
and
we
can
not
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
anything
but
our
own
heart
supposing
we
ever
get
so
far
does
this
mean
that
the
poet
has
experienced
what
he
depicts
that
he
has
gone
through
the
various
situations
he
makes
his
characters
traverse
and
lived
the
whole
of
their
inner
life
here
too
the
biographies
of
poets
would
contradict
such
a
supposition
how
indeed
could
the
same
man
have
been
macbeth
hamlet
othello
king
lear
and
many
others
but
then
a
distinction
should
perhaps
here
be
made
between
the
personality
we
have
and
all
those
we
might
have
had
our
character
is
the
result
of
a
choice
that
is
continually
being
renewed
there
are
points
at
all
events
there
seem
to
be
all
along
the
way
where
we
may
branch
off
and
we
perceive
many
possible
directions
though
we
are
unable
to
take
more
than
one
to
retrace
one
steps
and
follow
to
the
end
the
faintly
distinguishable
directions
appears
to
be
the
essential
element
in
poetic
imagination
of
course
shakespeare
was
neither
macbeth
nor
hamlet
nor
othello
still
he
might
have
been
these
several
characters
if
the
circumstances
of
the
case
on
the
one
hand
and
the
consent
of
his
will
on
the
other
had
caused
to
break
out
into
explosive
action
what
was
nothing
more
than
an
inner
prompting
we
are
strangely
mistaken
as
to
the
part
played
by
poetic
imagination
if
we
think
it
pieces
together
its
heroes
out
of
fragments
filched
from
right
and
left
as
though
it
were
patching
together
a
harlequin
motley
nothing
living
would
result
from
that
life
can
not
be
recomposed
it
can
only
be
looked
at
and
reproduced
poetic
imagination
is
but
a
fuller
view
of
reality
if
the
characters
created
by
a
poet
give
us
the
impression
of
life
it
is
only
because
they
are
the
poet
himself
multiplication
or
division
of
the
poet
the
poet
plumbing
the
depths
of
his
own
nature
in
so
powerful
an
effort
of
inner
observation
that
he
lays
hold
of
the
potential
in
the
real
and
takes
up
what
nature
has
left
as
a
mere
outline
or
sketch
in
his
soul
in
order
to
make
of
it
a
finished
work
of
art
altogether
different
is
the
kind
of
observation
from
which
comedy
springs
it
is
directed
outwards
however
interested
a
dramatist
may
be
in
the
comic
features
of
human
nature
he
will
hardly
go
i
imagine
to
the
extent
of
trying
to
discover
his
own
besides
he
would
not
find
them
for
we
are
never
ridiculous
except
in
some
point
that
remains
hidden
from
our
own
consciousness
it
is
on
others
then
that
such
observation
must
perforce
be
practised
but
it
will
for
this
very
reason
assume
a
character
of
generality
that
it
can
not
have
when
we
apply
it
to
ourselves
settling
on
the
surface
it
will
not
be
more
than
dealing
with
persons
at
the
point
at
which
they
come
into
contact
and
become
capable
of
resembling
one
another
it
will
go
no
farther
even
if
it
could
it
would
not
desire
to
do
so
for
it
would
have
nothing
to
gain
in
the
process
to
penetrate
too
far
into
the
personality
to
couple
the
outer
effect
with
causes
that
are
too
would
mean
to
endanger
and
in
the
end
to
sacrifice
all
that
was
laughable
in
the
effect
in
order
that
we
may
be
tempted
to
laugh
at
it
we
must
localise
its
cause
in
some
intermediate
region
of
the
soul
consequently
the
effect
must
appear
to
us
as
an
average
effect
as
expressing
an
average
of
mankind
and
like
all
averages
this
one
is
obtained
by
bringing
together
scattered
data
by
comparing
analogous
cases
and
extracting
their
essence
in
short
by
a
process
of
abstraction
and
generalisation
similar
to
that
which
the
physicist
brings
to
bear
upon
facts
with
the
object
of
grouping
them
under
laws
in
a
word
method
and
object
are
here
of
the
same
nature
as
in
the
inductive
sciences
in
that
observation
is
always
external
and
the
result
always
general
and
so
we
come
back
by
a
roundabout
way
to
the
double
conclusion
we
reached
in
the
course
of
our
investigations
on
the
one
hand
a
person
is
never
ridiculous
except
through
some
mental
attribute
resembling
through
something
that
lives
upon
him
without
forming
part
of
his
organism
after
the
fashion
of
a
parasite
that
is
the
reason
this
state
of
mind
is
observable
from
without
and
capable
of
being
corrected
but
on
the
other
hand
just
because
laughter
aims
at
correcting
it
is
expedient
that
the
correction
should
reach
as
great
a
number
of
persons
as
possible
this
is
the
reason
comic
observation
instinctively
proceeds
to
what
is
general
it
chooses
such
peculiarities
as
admit
of
being
reproduced
and
consequently
are
not
indissolubly
bound
up
with
the
individuality
of
a
single
person
a
possibly
common
sort
of
uncommonness
so
to
say
peculiarities
that
are
held
in
common
by
transferring
them
to
the
stage
it
creates
works
which
doubtless
belong
to
art
in
that
their
only
visible
aim
is
to
please
but
which
will
be
found
to
contrast
with
other
works
of
art
by
reason
of
their
generality
and
also
of
their
scarcely
confessed
or
scarcely
conscious
intention
to
correct
and
instruct
so
we
were
probably
right
in
saying
that
comedy
lies
midway
between
art
and
life
it
is
not
disinterested
as
genuine
art
is
by
organising
laughter
comedy
accepts
social
life
as
a
natural
environment
it
even
obeys
an
impulse
of
social
life
and
in
this
respect
it
turns
its
back
upon
art
which
is
a
breaking
away
from
society
and
a
return
to
pure
nature
ii
now
let
us
see
in
the
light
of
what
has
gone
before
the
line
to
take
for
creating
an
ideally
comic
type
of
character
comic
in
itself
in
its
origin
and
in
all
its
manifestations
it
must
be
so
as
to
supply
comedy
with
inexhaustible
matter
and
yet
superficial
in
order
that
it
may
remain
within
the
scope
of
comedy
invisible
to
its
actual
owner
for
the
comic
ever
partakes
of
the
unconscious
but
visible
to
everybody
else
so
that
it
may
call
forth
general
laughter
extremely
considerate
to
its
own
self
so
that
it
may
be
displayed
without
scruple
but
troublesome
to
others
so
that
they
may
repress
it
without
pity
immediately
repressible
so
that
our
laughter
may
not
have
been
wasted
but
sure
of
reappearing
under
fresh
aspects
so
that
laughter
may
always
find
something
to
do
inseparable
from
social
life
although
insufferable
to
society
capable
in
order
that
it
may
assume
the
greatest
imaginable
variety
of
forms
of
being
tacked
on
to
all
the
vices
and
even
to
a
good
many
virtues
truly
a
goodly
number
of
elements
to
fuse
together
but
a
chemist
of
the
soul
entrusted
with
this
elaborate
preparation
would
be
somewhat
disappointed
when
pouring
out
the
contents
of
his
retort
he
would
find
he
had
taken
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
to
compound
a
mixture
which
may
be
found
and
free
of
expense
for
it
is
as
widespread
throughout
mankind
as
air
throughout
nature
this
mixture
is
vanity
probably
there
is
not
a
single
failing
that
is
more
superficial
or
more
the
wounds
it
receives
are
never
very
serious
and
yet
they
are
seldom
healed
the
services
rendered
to
it
are
the
most
unreal
of
all
services
and
yet
they
are
the
very
ones
that
meet
with
lasting
gratitude
it
is
scarcely
a
vice
and
yet
all
the
vices
are
drawn
into
its
orbit
and
in
proportion
as
they
become
more
refined
and
artificial
tend
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
means
of
satisfying
it
the
outcome
of
social
life
since
it
is
an
admiration
of
ourselves
based
on
the
admiration
we
think
we
are
inspiring
in
others
it
is
even
more
natural
more
universally
innate
than
egoism
for
egoism
may
be
conquered
by
nature
whereas
only
by
reflection
do
we
get
the
better
of
vanity
it
does
not
seem
indeed
as
if
men
were
ever
born
modest
unless
we
dub
with
the
name
of
modesty
a
sort
of
purely
physical
bashfulness
which
is
nearer
to
pride
than
is
generally
supposed
true
modesty
can
be
nothing
but
a
meditation
on
vanity
it
springs
from
the
sight
of
others
mistakes
and
the
dread
of
being
similarly
deceived
it
is
a
sort
of
scientific
cautiousness
with
respect
to
what
we
shall
say
and
think
of
ourselves
it
is
made
up
of
improvements
and
in
short
it
is
an
acquired
virtue
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
define
the
point
at
which
the
anxiety
to
become
modest
may
be
distinguished
from
the
dread
of
becoming
ridiculous
but
surely
at
the
outset
this
dread
and
this
anxiety
are
one
and
the
same
thing
a
complete
investigation
into
the
illusions
of
vanity
and
into
the
ridicule
that
clings
to
them
would
cast
a
strange
light
upon
the
whole
theory
of
laughter
we
should
find
laughter
performing
with
mathematical
regularity
one
of
its
main
functions
that
of
bringing
back
to
complete
a
certain
which
is
almost
automatic
and
thus
obtaining
the
greatest
possible
sociability
of
characters
we
should
see
that
vanity
though
it
is
a
natural
product
of
social
life
is
an
inconvenience
to
society
just
as
certain
slight
poisons
continually
secreted
by
the
human
organism
would
destroy
it
in
the
long
run
if
they
were
not
neutralised
by
other
secretions
laughter
is
unceasingly
doing
work
of
this
kind
in
this
respect
it
might
be
said
that
the
specific
remedy
for
vanity
is
laughter
and
that
the
one
failing
that
is
essentially
laughable
is
vanity
while
dealing
with
the
comic
in
form
and
movement
we
showed
how
any
simple
image
laughable
in
itself
is
capable
of
worming
its
way
into
other
images
of
a
more
complex
nature
and
instilling
into
them
something
of
its
comic
essence
thus
the
highest
forms
of
the
comic
can
sometimes
be
explained
by
the
lowest
the
inverse
process
however
is
perhaps
even
more
common
and
many
coarse
comic
effects
are
the
direct
result
of
a
drop
from
some
very
subtle
comic
element
for
instance
vanity
that
higher
form
of
the
comic
is
an
element
we
are
prone
to
look
for
minutely
though
unconsciously
in
every
manifestation
of
human
activity
we
look
for
it
if
only
to
laugh
at
it
indeed
our
imagination
often
locates
it
where
it
has
no
business
to
be
perhaps
we
must
attribute
to
this
source
the
altogether
coarse
comic
element
in
certain
effects
which
psychologists
have
very
inadequately
explained
by
contrast
a
short
man
bowing
his
head
to
pass
beneath
a
large
door
two
individuals
one
very
tall
the
other
a
mere
dwarf
gravely
walking
along
etc
by
scanning
narrowly
this
latter
image
we
shall
probably
find
that
the
shorter
of
the
two
persons
seems
as
though
he
were
trying
to
raise
himself
to
the
height
of
the
taller
like
the
frog
that
wanted
to
make
itself
as
large
as
the
ox
iii
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
go
through
all
the
peculiarities
of
character
that
either
coalesce
or
compete
with
vanity
in
order
to
force
themselves
upon
the
attention
of
the
comic
poet
we
have
shown
that
all
failings
may
become
laughable
and
even
occasionally
many
a
good
quality
even
though
a
list
of
all
the
peculiarities
that
have
ever
been
found
ridiculous
were
drawn
up
comedy
would
manage
to
add
to
them
not
indeed
by
creating
artificial
ones
but
by
discovering
lines
of
comic
development
that
had
hitherto
gone
unnoticed
thus
does
imagination
isolate
ever
fresh
figures
in
the
intricate
design
of
one
and
the
same
piece
of
tapestry
the
essential
condition
as
we
know
is
that
the
peculiarity
observed
should
straightway
appear
as
a
kind
of
category
into
which
a
number
of
individuals
can
step
now
there
are
categories
established
by
society
itself
and
necessary
to
it
because
it
is
based
on
the
division
of
labour
we
mean
the
various
trades
public
services
and
professions
each
particular
profession
impresses
on
its
corporate
members
certain
habits
of
mind
and
peculiarities
of
character
in
which
they
resemble
each
other
and
also
distinguish
themselves
from
the
rest
small
societies
are
thus
formed
within
the
bosom
of
society
at
large
doubtless
they
arise
from
the
very
organisation
of
society
as
a
whole
and
yet
if
they
held
too
much
aloof
there
would
be
a
risk
of
their
proving
harmful
to
sociability
now
it
is
the
business
of
laughter
to
repress
any
separatist
tendency
its
function
is
to
convert
rigidity
into
plasticity
to
readapt
the
individual
to
the
whole
in
short
to
round
off
the
corners
wherever
they
are
met
with
accordingly
we
here
find
a
species
of
the
comic
whose
varieties
might
be
calculated
beforehand
this
we
shall
call
the
professional
comic
instead
of
taking
up
these
varieties
in
detail
we
prefer
to
lay
stress
upon
what
they
have
in
common
in
the
forefront
we
find
professional
vanity
each
one
of
jourdain
teachers
exalts
his
own
art
above
all
the
rest
in
a
play
of
labiche
there
is
a
character
who
can
not
understand
how
it
is
possible
to
be
anything
else
than
a
timber
merchant
naturally
he
is
a
timber
merchant
himself
note
that
vanity
here
tends
to
merge
into
solemnity
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
quackery
there
is
in
the
profession
under
consideration
for
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
more
questionable
an
art
science
or
occupation
is
the
more
those
who
practise
it
are
inclined
to
regard
themselves
as
invested
with
a
kind
of
priesthood
and
to
claim
that
all
should
bow
before
its
mysteries
useful
professions
are
clearly
meant
for
the
public
but
those
whose
utility
is
more
dubious
can
only
justify
their
existence
by
assuming
that
the
public
is
meant
for
them
now
this
is
just
the
illusion
that
lies
at
the
root
of
solemnity
almost
everything
comic
in
moliere
doctors
comes
from
this
source
they
treat
the
patient
as
though
he
had
been
made
for
the
doctors
and
nature
herself
as
an
appendage
to
medicine
another
form
of
this
comic
rigidity
is
what
may
be
called
professional
callousness
the
comic
character
is
so
tightly
jammed
into
the
rigid
frame
of
his
functions
that
he
has
no
room
to
move
or
to
be
moved
like
other
men
only
call
to
mind
the
answer
isabelle

from

dandin

judge
when
she
asks
him
how
he
can
bear
to
look

the
device
most
in
use
however
for
making
a
profession
ludicrous
is
to
confine
it
so
to
say
within
the
four
corners
of
its
own
particular
jargon
judge
doctor
and
soldier
are
made
to
apply
the
language
of

medicine
and
strategy
to
the
everyday
affairs
of
life
as
though
they
had
became
incapable
of
talking
like
ordinary
people
as
a
rule
this
kind
of
the
ludicrous
is
rather
coarse
it
becomes
more
refined
however
as
we
have
already
said
if
it
reveals
some
peculiarity
of
character
in
addition
to
a
professional
habit
we
will
instance
only
regnard
joueur
who
expresses
himself
with
the
utmost
originality
in
terms
borrowed
from
gambling
giving
his
valet
the
name
of
hector
and
calling
his
betrothed

la

de

pallas
from
the
name
of
the
queen
of
spades
or
moliere
femmes
savantes
where
the
comic
element
evidently
consists
largely
in
the
translation
of
ideas
of
a
scientific
nature
into
terms
of
feminine
sensibility
epicure

les

etc
you
have
only
to
read
the
third
act
to
find
that
armande
philaminte
and
belise
almost
invariably
express
themselves
in
this
style
proceeding
further
in
the
same
direction
we
discover
that
there
is
also
such
a
thing
as
a
professional
logic
certain
ways
of
reasoning
that
are
customary
in
certain
circles
which
are
valid
for
these
circles
but
untrue
for
the
rest
of
the
public
now
the
contrast
between
these
two
kinds
of
logic
one
particular
the
other
universal
produces
comic
effects
of
a
special
nature
on
which
we
may
advantageously
dwell
at
greater
length
here
we
touch
upon
a
point
of
some
consequence
in
the
theory
of
laughter
we
propose
therefore
to
give
the
question
a
wider
scope
and
consider
it
in
its
most
general
aspect
iv
eager
as
we
have
been
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
comic
we
have
so
far
had
to
neglect
one
of
its
most
striking
phenomena
we
refer
to
the
logic
peculiar
to
the
comic
character
and
the
comic
group
a
strange
kind
of
logic
which
in
some
cases
may
include
a
good
deal
of
absurdity
theophile
gautier
said
that
the
comic
in
its
extreme
form
was
the
logic
of
the
absurd
more
than
one
philosophy
of
laughter
revolves
round
a
like
idea
every
comic
effect
it
is
said
implies
contradiction
in
some
of
its
aspects
what
makes
us
laugh
is
alleged
to
be
the
absurd
realised
in
concrete
shape
a
palpable
absurdity
or
again
an
apparent
absurdity
which
we
swallow
for
the
moment
only
to
rectify
it
immediately
afterwards
or
better
still
something
absurd
from
one
point
of
view
though
capable
of
a
natural
explanation
from
another
etc
all
these
theories
may
contain
some
portion
of
the
truth
but
in
the
first
place
they
apply
only
to
certain
rather
obvious
comic
effects
and
then
even
where
they
do
apply
they
evidently
take
no
account
of
the
characteristic
element
of
the
laughable
that
is
the
particular
kind
of
absurdity
the
comic
contains
when
it
does
contain
something
absurd
is
an
immediate
proof
of
this
desired
you
have
only
to
choose
one
of
these
definitions
and
make
up
effects
in
accordance
with
the
formula
twice
out
of
every
three
times
there
will
be
nothing
laughable
in
the
effect
obtained
so
we
see
that
absurdity
when
met
with
in
the
comic
is
not
absurdity
in
general
it
is
an
absurdity
of
a
definite
kind
it
does
not
create
the
comic
rather
we
might
say
that
the
comic
infuses
into
it
its
own
particular
essence
it
is
not
a
cause
but
an
effect
an
effect
of
a
very
special
kind
which
reflects
the
special
nature
of
its
cause
now
this
cause
is
known
to
us
consequently
we
shall
have
no
trouble
in
understanding
the
nature
of
the
effect
assume
when
out
for
a
country
walk
that
you
notice
on
the
top
of
a
hill
something
that
bears
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
large
motionless
body
with
revolving
arms
so
far
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
but
you
begin
to
search
amongst
your
ideas
that
is
to
say
in
the
present
instance
amongst
the
recollections
at
your
disposal
for
that
recollection
which
will
best
fit
in
with
what
you
see
almost
immediately
the
image
of
a
windmill
comes
into
your
mind
the
object
before
you
is
a
windmill
no
matter
if
before
leaving
the
house
you
have
just
been
reading
telling
of
giants
with
enormous
arms
for
although
common
sense
consists
mainly
in
being
able
to
remember
it
consists
even
more
in
being
able
to
forget
common
sense
represents
the
endeavour
of
a
mind
continually
adapting
itself
anew
and
changing
ideas
when
it
changes
objects
it
is
the
mobility
of
the
intelligence
conforming
exactly
to
the
mobility
of
things
it
is
the
moving
continuity
of
our
attention
to
life
but
now
let
us
take
don
quixote
setting
out
for
the
wars
the
romances
he
has
been
reading
all
tell
of
knights
encountering
on
the
way
giant
adversaries
he
therefore
must
needs
encounter
a
giant
this
idea
of
a
giant
is
a
privileged
recollection
which
has
taken
its
abode
in
his
mind
and
lies
there
in
wait
motionless
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
sally
forth
and
become
embodied
in
a
thing
it
is
bent
on
entering
the
material
world
and
so
the
very
first
object
he
sees
bearing
the
faintest
resemblance
to
a
giant
is
invested
with
the
form
of
one
thus
don
quixote
sees
giants
where
we
see
windmills
this
is
comical
it
is
also
absurd
but
is
it
a
mere
absurdity
an
absurdity
of
an
indefinite
kind
it
is
a
very
special
inversion
of
common
sense
it
consists
in
seeking
to
mould
things
on
an
idea
of
one
own
instead
of
moulding
ideas
on
things
in
seeing
before
us
what
we
are
thinking
of
instead
of
thinking
of
what
we
see
good
sense
would
have
us
leave
all
our
memories
in
their
proper
rank
and
file
then
the
appropriate
memory
will
every
time
answer
the
summons
of
the
situation
of
the
moment
and
serve
only
to
interpret
it
but
in
don
quixote
on
the
contrary
there
is
one
group
of
memories
in
command
of
all
the
rest
and
dominating
the
character
itself
thus
it
is
reality
that
now
has
to
bow
to
imagination
its
only
function
being
to
supply
fancy
with
a
body
once
the
illusion
has
been
created
don
quixote
develops
it
logically
enough
in
all
its
consequences
he
proceeds
with
the
certainty
and
precision
of
a
somnambulist
who
is
acting
his
dream
such
then
is
the
origin
of
his
delusions
and
such
the
particular
logic
which
controls
this
particular
absurdity
now
is
this
logic
peculiar
to
don
quixote
we
have
shown
that
the
comic
character
always
errs
through
obstinacy
of
mind
or
of
disposition
through
absentmindedness
in
short
through
automatism
at
the
root
of
the
comic
there
is
a
sort
of
rigidity
which
compels
its
victims
to
keep
strictly
to
one
path
to
follow
it
straight
along
to
shut
their
ears
and
refuse
to
listen
in
moliere
plays
how
many
comic
scenes
can
be
reduced
to
this
simple
type
a
character
following
up
his
one
idea
and
continually
recurring
to
it
in
spite
of
incessant
interruptions
the
transition
seems
to
take
place
imperceptibly
from
the
man
who
will
listen
to
nothing
to
the
one
who
will
see
nothing
and
from
this
latter
to
the
one
who
sees
only
what
he
wants
to
see
a
stubborn
spirit
ends
by
adjusting
things
to
its
own
way
of
thinking
instead
of
accommodating
its
thoughts
to
the
things
so
every
comic
character
is
on
the
highroad
to
the
illusion
and
don
quixote
furnishes
us
with
the
general
type
of
comic
absurdity
is
there
a
name
for
this
inversion
of
common
sense
doubtless
it
may
be
found
in
either
an
acute
or
a
chronic
form
in
certain
types
of
insanity
in
many
of
its
aspects
it
resembles
a
fixed
idea
but
neither
insanity
in
general
nor
fixed
ideas
in
particular
are
provocative
of
laughter
they
are
diseases
and
arouse
our
pity
laughter
as
we
have
seen
is
incompatible
with
emotion
if
there
exists
a
madness
that
is
laughable
it
can
only
be
one
compatible
with
the
general
health
of
the
mind
a
sane
type
of
madness
one
might
say
now
there
is
a
sane
state
of
the
mind
that
resembles
madness
in
every
respect
in
which
we
find
the
same
associations
of
ideas
as
we
do
in
lunacy
the
same
peculiar
logic
as
in
a
fixed
idea
this
state
is
that
of
dreams
so
either
our
analysis
is
incorrect
or
it
must
be
capable
of
being
stated
in
the
following
theorem
comic
absurdity
is
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
dreams
the
behaviour
of
the
intellect
in
a
dream
is
exactly
what
we
have
just
been
describing
the
mind
enamoured
of
itself
now
seeks
in
the
outer
world
nothing
more
than
a
pretext
for
realising
its
imaginations
a
confused
murmur
of
sounds
still
reaches
the
ear
colours
enter
the
field
of
vision
the
senses
are
not
completely
shut
in
but
the
dreamer
instead
of
appealing
to
the
whole
of
his
recollections
for
the
interpretation
of
what
his
senses
perceive
makes
use
of
what
he
perceives
to
give
substance
to
the
particular
recollection
he
favours
thus
according
to
the
mood
of
the
dreamer
and
the
idea
that
fills
his
imagination
at
the
time
a
gust
of
wind
blowing
down
the
chimney
becomes
the
howl
of
a
wild
beast
or
a
tuneful
melody
such
is
the
ordinary
mechanism
of
illusion
in
dreams
now
if
comic
illusion
is
similar
to
dream
illusion
if
the
logic
of
the
comic
is
the
logic
of
dreams
we
may
expect
to
discover
in
the
logic
of
the
laughable
all
the
peculiarities
of
dream
logic
here
again
we
shall
find
an
illustration
of
the
law
with
which
we
are
well
acquainted
given
one
form
of
the
laughable
other
forms
that
are
lacking
in
the
same
comic
essence
become
laughable
from
their
outward
resemblance
to
the
first
indeed
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
any
play
of
ideas
may
afford
us
amusement
if
only
it
bring
back
to
mind
more
or
less
distinctly
the
play
of
dreamland
we
shall
first
call
attention
to
a
certain
general
relaxation
of
the
rules
of
reasoning
the
reasonings
at
which
we
laugh
are
those
we
know
to
be
false
but
which
we
might
accept
as
true
were
we
to
hear
them
in
a
dream
they
counterfeit
true
reasoning
just
sufficiently
to
deceive
a
mind
dropping
off
to
sleep
there
is
still
an
element
of
logic
in
them
if
you
will
but
it
is
a
logic
lacking
in
tension
and
for
that
very
reason
affording
us
relief
from
intellectual
effort
many
witticisms
are
reasonings
of
this
kind
considerably
abridged
reasonings
of
which
we
are
given
only
the
beginning
and
the
end
such
play
upon
ideas
evolves
in
the
direction
of
a
play
upon
words
in
proportion
as
the
relations
set
up
between
the
ideas
become
more
superficial
gradually
we
come
to
take
no
account
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
we
hear
but
only
of
their
sound
it
might
be
instructive
to
compare
with
dreams
certain
comic
scenes
in
which
one
of
the
characters
systematically
repeats
in
a
nonsensical
fashion
what
another
character
whispers
in
his
ear
if
you
fall
asleep
with
people
talking
round
you
you
sometimes
find
that
what
they
say
gradually
becomes
devoid
of
meaning
that
the
sounds
get
distorted
as
it
were
and
recombine
in
a
haphazard
fashion
to
form
in
your
mind
the
strangest
of
meanings
and
that
you
are
reproducing
between
yourself
and
the
different
speakers
the
scene
between
and
the
prompter
footnote
les
plaideurs
racine
there
are
also
comic
obsessions
that
seem
to
bear
a
great
resemblance
to
dream
obsessions
who
has
not
had
the
experience
of
seeing
the
same
image
appear
in
several
successive
dreams
assuming
a
plausible
meaning
in
each
of
them
whereas
these
dreams
had
no
other
point
in
common
effects
of
repetition
sometimes
present
this
special
form
on
the
stage
or
in
fiction
some
of
them
in
fact
sound
as
though
they
belonged
to
a
dream
it
may
be
the
same
with
the
burden
of
many
a
song
it
persistently
recurs
always
unchanged
at
the
end
of
every
verse
each
time
with
a
different
meaning
not
infrequently
do
we
notice
in
dreams
a
particular
crescendo
a
weird
effect
that
grows
more
pronounced
as
we
proceed
the
first
concession
extorted
from
reason
introduces
a
second
and
this
one
another
of
a
more
serious
nature
and
so
on
till
the
crowning
absurdity
is
reached
now
this
progress
towards
the
absurd
produces
on
the
dreamer
a
very
peculiar
sensation
such
is
probably
the
experience
of
the
tippler
when
he
feels
himself
pleasantly
drifting
into
a
state
of
blankness
in
which
neither
reason
nor
propriety
has
any
meaning
for
him
now
consider
whether
some
of
moliere
plays
would
not
produce
the
same
sensation
for
instance
monsieur
de
pourceaugnac
which
after
beginning
almost
reasonably
develops
into
a
sequence
of
all
sorts
of
absurdities
consider
also
the
bourgeois
gentilhomme
where
the
different
characters
seem
to
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
up
in
a
very
whirlwind
of
madness
as
the
play
proceeds
if
it
is
possible
to
find
a
man
more
completely
mad
i
will
go
and
publish
it
in
rome
this
sentence
which
warns
us
that
the
play
is
over
rouses
us
from
the
increasingly
extravagant
dream
into
which
along
with
jourdain
we
have
been
sinking
but
above
all
there
is
a
special
madness
that
is
peculiar
to
dreams
there
are
certain
special
contradictions
so
natural
to
the
imagination
of
a
dreamer
and
so
absurd
to
the
reason
of
a
man
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
a
full
and
correct
idea
of
their
nature
to
anyone
who
had
not
experienced
them
we
allude
to
the
strange
fusion
that
a
dream
often
effects
between
two
persons
who
henceforth
form
only
one
and
yet
remain
distinct
generally
one
of
these
is
the
dreamer
himself
he
feels
he
has
not
ceased
to
be
what
he
is
yet
he
has
become
someone
else
he
is
himself
and
not
himself
he
hears
himself
speak
and
sees
himself
act
but
he
feels
that
some
other
he
has
borrowed
his
body
and
stolen
his
voice
or
perhaps
he
is
conscious
of
speaking
and
acting
as
usual
but
he
speaks
of
himself
as
a
stranger
with
whom
he
has
nothing
in
common
he
has
stepped
out
of
his
own
self
does
it
not
seem
as
though
we
found
this
same
extraordinary
confusion
in
many
a
comic
scene
i
am
not
speaking
of
amphitryon
in
which
play
the
confusion
is
perhaps
suggested
to
the
mind
of
the
spectator
though
the
bulk
of
the
comic
effect
proceeds
rather
from
what
we
have
already
called
a
reciprocal
interference
of
two
series
i
am
speaking
of
the
extravagant
and
comic
reasonings
in
which
we
really
meet
with
this
confusion
in
its
pure
form
though
it
requires
some
looking
into
to
pick
it
out
for
instance
listen
to
mark
twain
replies
to
the
reporter
who
called
to
interview
him
question
is
that
a
brother
of
yours
answer
oh
yes
yes
yes
now
you
remind
me
of
it
that
was
a
brother
of
mine
that
william
bill
we
called
him
poor
old
bill
q
why
is
he
dead
then
ah
well
i
suppose
so
we
never
could
tell
there
was
a
great
mystery
about
it
q
that
is
sad
very
sad
he
disappeared
then
a
well
yes
in
a
sort
of
general
way
we
buried
him
q
buried
him
buried
him
without
knowing
whether
he
was
dead
or
not
oh
no
not
that
he
was
dead
enough
q
well
i
confess
that
i
ca
understand
this
if
you
buried
him
and
you
knew
he
was
dead
a
no
no
we
only
thought
he
was
oh
i
see
he
came
to
life
again
i
bet
he
did
q
well
i
never
heard
anything
like
this
somebody
was
dead
somebody
was
buried
now
where
was
the
mystery
ah
that
just
it
it
exactly
you
see
we
were
twins
defunct
and
i
and
we
got
mixed
in
the
when
we
were
only
two
weeks
old
and
one
of
us
was
drowned
but
we
did
know
which
some
think
it
was
bill
some
think
it
was
me
q
well
that
is
remarkable
what
do
you
think
goodness
knows
i
would
give
whole
worlds
to
know
this
solemn
this
awful
tragedy
has
cast
a
gloom
over
my
whole
life
but
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
now
which
i
have
never
revealed
to
any
creature
before
one
of
us
had
a
peculiar
mark
a
large
mole
on
the
back
of
his
left
hand
that
was
me
that
child
was
the
one
that
was
drowned
etc
a
close
examination
will
show
us
that
the
absurdity
of
this
dialogue
is
by
no
means
an
absurdity
of
an
ordinary
type
it
would
disappear
were
not
the
speaker
himself
one
of
the
twins
in
the
story
it
results
entirely
from
the
fact
that
mark
twain
asserts
he
is
one
of
these
twins
whilst
all
the
time
he
talks
as
though
he
were
a
third
person
who
tells
the
tale
in
many
of
our
dreams
we
adopt
exactly
the
same
method
v
regarded
from
this
latter
point
of
view
the
comic
seems
to
show
itself
in
a
form
somewhat
different
from
the
one
we
lately
attributed
to
it
up
to
this
point
we
have
regarded
laughter
as
first
and
foremost
a
means
of
correction
if
you
take
the
series
of
comic
varieties
and
isolate
the
predominant
types
at
long
intervals
you
will
find
that
all
the
intervening
varieties
borrow
their
comic
quality
from
their
resemblance
to
these
types
and
that
the
types
themselves
are
so
many
models
of
impertinence
with
regard
to
society
to
these
impertinences
society
retorts
by
laughter
an
even
greater
impertinence
so
evidently
there
is
nothing
very
benevolent
in
laughter
it
seems
rather
inclined
to
return
evil
for
evil
but
this
is
not
what
we
are
immediately
struck
by
in
our
first
impression
of
the
laughable
the
comic
character
is
often
one
with
whom
to
begin
with
our
mind
or
rather
our
body
sympathises
by
this
is
meant
that
we
put
ourselves
for
a
very
short
time
in
his
place
adopt
his
gestures
words
arid
actions
and
if
amused
by
anything
laughable
in
him
invite
him
in
imagination
to
share
his
amusement
with
us
in
fact
we
treat
him
first
as
a
playmate
so
in
the
laugher
we
find
a
spirit
as
far
at
least
as
appearances
go
which
it
would
be
wrong
of
us
not
to
take
into
consideration
in
particular
there
is
in
laughter
a
movement
of
relaxation
which
has
often
been
noticed
and
the
reason
of
which
we
must
try
to
discover
nowhere
is
this
impression
more
noticeable
than
in
the
last
few
examples
in
them
indeed
we
shall
find
its
explanation
when
the
comic
character
automatically
follows
up
his
idea
he
ultimately
thinks
speaks
and
acts
as
though
he
were
dreaming
now
a
dream
is
a
relaxation
to
remain
in
touch
with
things
and
men
to
see
nothing
but
what
is
existent
and
think
nothing
but
what
is
consistent
demands
a
continuous
effort
of
intellectual
tension
this
effort
is
common
sense
and
to
remain
sensible
is
indeed
to
remain
at
work
but
to
detach
oneself
from
things
and
yet
continue
to
perceive
images
to
break
away
from
logic
and
yet
continue
to
string
together
ideas
is
to
indulge
in
play
or
if
you
prefer
in
dolce
far
niente
so
comic
absurdity
gives
us
from
the
outset
the
impression
of
playing
with
ideas
our
first
impulse
is
to
join
in
the
game
that
relieves
us
from
the
strain
of
thinking
now
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
other
forms
of
the
laughable
in
the
comic
there
is
always
a
tendency
we
said
to
take
the
line
of
least
resistance
generally
that
of
habit
the
comic
character
no
longer
tries
to
be
ceaselessly
adapting
and
readapting
himself
to
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
he
slackens
in
the
attention
that
is
due
to
life
he
more
or
less
resembles
the
absentminded
maybe
his
will
is
here
even
more
concerned
than
his
intellect
and
there
is
not
so
much
a
want
of
attention
as
a
lack
of
tension
still
in
some
way
or
another
he
is
absent
away
from
his
work
taking
it
easy
he
abandons
social
convention
as
indeed
in
the
case
we
have
just
been
considering
he
abandoned
logic
here
too
our
first
impulse
is
to
accept
the
invitation
to
take
it
easy
for
a
short
time
at
all
events
we
join
in
the
game
and
that
relieves
us
from
the
strain
of
living
but
we
rest
only
for
a
short
time
the
sympathy
that
is
capable
of
entering
into
the
impression
of
the
comic
is
a
very
fleeting
one
it
also
comes
from
a
lapse
in
attention
thus
a
stern
father
may
at
times
forget
himself
and
join
in
some
prank
his
child
is
playing
only
to
check
himself
at
once
in
order
to
correct
it
laughter
is
above
all
a
corrective
being
intended
to
humiliate
it
must
make
a
painful
impression
on
the
person
against
whom
it
is
directed
by
laughter
society
avenges
itself
for
the
liberties
taken
with
it
it
would
fail
in
its
object
if
it
bore
the
stamp
of
sympathy
or
kindness
shall
we
be
told
that
the
motive
at
all
events
may
be
a
good
one
that
we
often
punish
because
we
love
and
that
laughter
by
checking
the
outer
manifestations
of
certain
failings
thus
causes
the
person
laughed
at
to
correct
these
failings
and
thereby
improve
himself
inwardly
much
might
be
said
on
this
point
as
a
general
rule
and
speaking
roughly
laughter
doubtless
exercises
a
useful
function
indeed
the
whole
of
our
analysis
points
to
this
fact
but
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
laughter
always
hits
the
mark
or
is
invariably
inspired
by
sentiments
of
kindness
or
even
of
justice
to
be
certain
of
always
hitting
the
mark
it
would
have
to
proceed
from
an
act
of
reflection
now
laughter
is
simply
the
result
of
a
mechanism
set
up
in
us
by
nature
or
what
is
almost
the
same
thing
by
our
long
acquaintance
with
social
life
it
goes
off
spontaneously
and
returns
tit
for
tat
it
has
no
time
to
look
where
it
hits
laughter
punishes
certain
failing
somewhat
as
disease
punishes
certain
forms
of
excess
striking
down
some
who
are
innocent
and
sparing
some
who
are
guilty
aiming
at
a
general
result
and
incapable
of
dealing
separately
with
each
individual
case
and
so
it
is
with
everything
that
comes
to
pass
by
natural
means
instead
of
happening
by
conscious
reflection
an
average
of
justice
may
show
itself
in
the
total
result
though
the
details
taken
separately
often
point
to
anything
but
justice
in
this
sense
laughter
can
not
be
absolutely
just
nor
should
it
be
either
its
function
is
to
intimidate
by
humiliating
now
it
would
not
succeed
in
doing
this
had
not
nature
implanted
for
that
very
purpose
even
in
the
best
of
men
a
spark
of
spitefulness
or
at
all
events
of
mischief
perhaps
we
had
better
not
investigate
this
point
too
closely
for
we
should
not
find
anything
very
flattering
to
ourselves
we
should
see
that
this
movement
of
relaxation
or
expansion
is
nothing
but
a
prelude
to
laughter
that
the
laugher
immediately
retires
within
himself
more
and
conceited
than
ever
and
is
evidently
disposed
to
look
upon
another
personality
as
a
marionette
of
which
he
pulls
the
strings
in
this
presumptuousness
we
speedily
discern
a
degree
of
egoism
and
behind
this
latter
something
less
spontaneous
and
more
bitter
the
beginnings
of
a
curious
pessimism
which
becomes
the
more
pronounced
as
the
laugher
more
closely
analyses
his
laughter
here
as
elsewhere
nature
has
utilised
evil
with
a
view
to
good
it
is
more
especially
the
good
that
has
engaged
our
attention
throughout
this
work
we
have
seen
that
the
more
society
improves
the
more
plastic
is
the
adaptability
it
obtains
from
its
members
while
the
greater
the
tendency
towards
increasing
stability
below
the
more
does
it
force
to
the
surface
the
disturbing
elements
inseparable
from
so
vast
a
bulk
and
thus
laughter
performs
a
useful
function
by
emphasising
the
form
of
these
significant
undulations
such
is
also
the
truceless
warfare
of
the
waves
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
whilst
profound
peace
reigns
in
the
depths
below
the
billows
clash
and
collide
with
each
other
as
they
strive
to
find
their
level
a
fringe
of
foam
feathery
and
frolicsome
follows
their
changing
outlines
from
time
to
time
the
receding
wave
leaves
behind
a
remnant
of
foam
on
the
sandy
beach
the
child
who
plays
hard
by
picks
up
a
handful
and
the
next
moment
is
astonished
to
find
that
nothing
remains
in
his
grasp
but
a
few
drops
of
water
water
that
is
far
more
brackish
far
more
bitter
than
that
of
the
wave
which
brought
it
laughter
comes
into
being
in
the
fashion
it
indicates
a
slight
revolt
on
the
surface
of
social
life
it
instantly
adopts
the
changing
forms
of
the
disturbance
it
also
is
afroth
with
a
saline
base
like
froth
it
sparkles
it
is
gaiety
itself
but
the
philosopher
who
gathers
a
handful
to
taste
may
find
that
the
substance
is
scanty
and
the
bitter
the
end
