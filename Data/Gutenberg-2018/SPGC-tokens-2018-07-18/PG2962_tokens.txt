chapter
v
my
fortune
in
holland
my
return
to
paris
with
young
pompeati
amongst
the
letters
which
were
waiting
for
me
was
one
from
the
which
advised
me
that
twenty
millions
in
government
securities
had
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
who
was
not
to
go
beyond
a
loss
of
eight
per
cent
and
another
letter
from
my
good
patron
de
bernis
telling
me
to
do
the
best
i
could
and
to
be
assured
that
the
ambassador
would
be
instructed
to
consent
to
whatever
bargain
might
be
made
provided
the
rate
was
not
more
disadvantageous
than
that
of
the
exchange
at
paris
boaz
who
was
astonished
at
the
bargain
i
had
made
with
my
shares
wanted
to
discount
the
government
securities
for
me
and
i
should
very
likely
have
agreed
to
his
terms
if
he
had
not
required
me
to
give
him
three
months
and
the
promise
that
the
agreement
should
hold
even
in
the
case
of
peace
being
concluded
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
that
i
should
do
well
to
get
back
to
amsterdam
but
i
did
not
care
to
break
my
word
to
therese
whom
i
had
promised
to
meet
at
the
hague
i
received
a
letter
from
her
while
i
was
at
the
play
and
the
servant
who
brought
it
told
me
he
was
waiting
to
conduct
me
to
her
i
sent
my
own
servant
home
and
set
out
on
my
quest
my
guide
made
me
climb
to
the
fourth
floor
of
a
somewhat
wretched
house
and
there
i
found
this
strange
woman
in
a
small
room
attended
by
her
son
and
daughter
the
table
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
room
and
was
covered
with
a
black
cloth
and
the
two
candles
standing
upon
it
made
it
look
like
some
sort
of
sepulchral
altar
the
hague
was
a
court
town
i
was
richly
dressed
my
elaborate
attire
made
the
saddest
possible
contrast
with
the
gloom
of
my
surroundings
therese
dressed
in
black
and
seated
between
her
children
at
that
black
table
reminded
me
of
medea
to
see
these
two
fair
young
creatures
vowed
to
a
lot
of
misery
and
disgrace
was
a
sad
and
touching
sight
i
took
the
boy
between
my
arms
and
pressing
him
to
my
breast
called
him
my
son
his
mother
told
him
to
look
upon
me
as
his
father
from
henceforth
the
lad
recognized
me
he
remembered
much
to
my
delight
seeing
me
in
the
may
of
in
venice
at
madame
manzoni
he
was
slight
but
strong
his
limbs
were
well
proportioned
and
his
features
intellectual
he
was
thirteen
years
old
his
sister
sat
perfectly
still
apparently
waiting
for
her
turn
to
come
i
took
her
on
my
knee
and
as
i
embraced
her
nature
herself
seemed
to
tell
me
that
she
was
my
daughter
she
took
my
kisses
in
silence
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
thought
herself
preferred
to
her
brother
and
was
charmed
with
the
idea
all
her
clothing
was
a
slight
frock
and
i
was
able
to
feel
every
limb
and
to
kiss
her
pretty
little
body
all
over
delighted
that
so
sweet
a
being
owed
her
existence
to
me
mamma
dear
said
she
is
not
this
fine
gentleman
the
same
we
saw
at
amsterdam
and
who
was
taken
for
my
papa
because
i
am
like
him
but
that
can
not
be
for
my
papa
is
dead
so
he
is
sweetheart
but
i
may
be
your
dear
friend
may
i
would
you
like
to
have
me
for
a
friend
yes
yes
she
cried
and
throwing
her
arms
about
my
neck
gave
me
a
thousand
kisses
which
i
returned
with
delight
after
we
had
talked
and
laughed
together
we
sat
down
at
table
and
the
heroine
therese
gave
me
a
delicate
supper
accompanied
by
exquisite
wines
i
have
never
given
the
margrave
better
fare
said
she
at
those
nice
little
suppers
we
used
to
take
together
wishing
to
probe
the
disposition
of
her
son
whom
i
had
engaged
to
take
away
with
me
i
addressed
several
remarks
to
him
and
soon
discovered
that
he
was
of
a
false
and
deceitful
nature
always
on
his
guard
taking
care
of
what
he
said
and
consequently
speaking
only
from
his
head
and
not
from
his
heart
every
word
was
delivered
with
a
quiet
politeness
which
no
doubt
was
intended
to
please
me
i
told
him
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
all
very
well
on
occasion
but
that
there
were
times
when
a
man
happiness
depended
on
his
freedom
from
constraint
then
and
only
then
was
his
amiability
if
he
had
any
displayed
his
mother
thinking
to
praise
him
told
me
that
reserve
was
his
chief
characteristic
that
she
had
trained
him
to
keep
his
counsel
at
all
times
and
places
and
that
she
was
thus
used
to
his
being
reserved
with
her
as
with
everyone
else
all
i
can
say
is
said
i
your
system
is
an
abominable
one
you
may
have
strangled
in
their
infancy
all
the
finer
qualities
with
which
nature
has
endowed
your
son
and
have
fairly
set
him
on
the
way
to
become
a
monster
instead
of
an
angel
i
do
see
how
the
most
devoted
father
can
possibly
have
any
affection
for
a
son
who
keeps
all
his
emotions
under
lock
and
key
this
outburst
which
proceeded
from
the
tenderness
i
would
fain
have
felt
for
the
boy
seemed
to
strike
his
mother
dumb
tell
me
my
dear
if
you
feel
yourself
capable
of
shewing
me
that
confidence
which
a
father
has
a
right
to
expect
of
a
good
son
and
if
you
can
promise
to
be
perfectly
open
and
unreserved
towards
me
i
promise
that
i
will
die
rather
than
tell
you
a
falsehood
that
just
like
him
said
the
mother
i
have
succeeded
in
inspiring
him
with
the
utmost
horror
of
untruthfulness
that
all
very
well
my
dear
madam
but
you
might
have
pursued
a
still
better
course
and
one
which
would
have
been
still
more
conducive
to
his
happiness
what
is
that
i
will
tell
you
it
was
necessary
to
make
him
detest
a
lie
you
should
have
rather
endeavoured
to
make
him
a
lover
of
the
truth
by
displaying
it
to
him
in
all
its
native
beauty
this
is
the
only
way
to
make
him
lovable
and
love
is
the
sole
bestower
of
happiness
in
this
world
but
is
it
the
same
thing
not
to
lie
and
to
tell
the
truth
said
the
boy
with
a
smile
which
charmed
his
mother
and
displeased
me
certainly
not
there
is
a
great
difference
for
to
avoid
lying
you
have
only
to
hold
your
tongue
and
do
you
think
that
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
speaking
the
truth
you
must
open
your
mind
to
me
my
son
and
tell
me
all
your
thoughts
even
if
you
blush
in
the
recital
i
will
teach
you
how
to
blush
and
soon
you
will
have
nothing
to
fear
in
laying
open
all
your
thoughts
and
deeds
when
we
know
each
other
a
little
longer
we
shall
see
how
we
agree
together
you
must
understand
that
i
can
not
look
upon
you
as
my
son
until
i
see
cause
to
love
you
and
i
can
not
have
you
call
me
father
till
you
treat
me
as
the
best
friend
you
have
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
find
a
way
to
discover
your
thoughts
however
cleverly
you
try
to
hide
them
if
i
find
you
deceitful
and
suspicious
i
shall
certainly
entertain
no
regard
for
you
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
my
business
at
amsterdam
we
will
set
out
for
paris
i
am
leaving
the
hague
and
on
my
return
i
hope
to
find
you
instructed
by
your
mother
in
a
system
of
morality
more
consonant
with
my
views
and
more
likely
to
lead
to
your
happiness
on
glancing
at
my
little
daughter
who
had
been
listening
to
me
with
the
greatest
attention
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
which
she
could
hardly
retain
why
are
you
crying
said
the
mother
it
is
silly
to
cry
and
with
that
the
child
ran
to
her
mother
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
would
you
like
to
come
to
paris
too
said
i
to
her
oh
yes
but
mamma
must
come
too
as
she
would
die
without
me
what
would
you
do
if
i
told
you
to
go
said
the
mother
i
would
obey
you
mamma
but
how
could
i
exist
away
from
you
thereupon
my
little
daughter
pretended
to
cry
i
say
pretended
as
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
child
did
not
mean
what
she
said
and
i
am
sure
that
her
mother
knew
it
as
well
as
i
it
was
really
a
melancholy
thing
to
see
the
effects
of
a
bad
education
on
this
young
child
to
whom
nature
had
given
intelligence
and
feeling
i
took
the
mother
on
one
side
and
said
that
if
she
had
intended
to
make
actors
of
her
children
she
had
succeeded
to
admiration
but
if
she
wished
them
to
become
useful
members
of
society
her
system
had
failed
lamentably
as
they
were
in
a
fair
way
to
become
monsters
of
deceit
i
continued
making
her
the
most
pointed
remonstrances
until
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
control
herself
she
burst
into
tears
however
she
soon
recovered
her
composure
and
begged
me
to
stay
at
the
hague
a
day
longer
but
i
told
her
it
was
out
of
the
question
and
left
the
room
i
came
in
again
a
few
minutes
after
and
sophie
came
up
to
me
and
said
in
a
loving
little
voice
if
you
are
really
my
friend
you
will
give
me
some
proof
of
your
friendship
and
what
proof
do
you
want
my
dear
i
want
you
to
come
and
sup
with
me
i
ca
sophie
dear
for
i
have
just
said
no
to
your
mother
and
she
would
be
offended
if
i
granted
you
what
i
had
refused
her
oh
no
she
would
it
was
she
who
told
me
to
ask
you
just
now
i
naturally
began
to
laugh
but
on
her
mother
calling
the
girl
a
little
fool
and
the
brother
adding
that
he
had
never
committed
such
an
indiscretion
the
poor
child
began
to
tremble
all
over
and
looked
abashed
i
reassured
her
as
best
i
could
not
caring
whether
what
i
said
displeased
her
mother
or
not
and
i
endeavoured
to
instill
into
her
principles
of
a
very
different
nature
to
those
in
which
she
had
been
reared
while
she
listened
with
an
eagerness
which
proved
that
her
heart
was
still
ready
to
learn
the
right
way
little
by
little
her
face
cleared
and
i
saw
that
i
had
made
an
impression
and
though
i
could
not
flatter
myself
that
any
good
i
might
do
her
would
be
lasting
in
its
effects
as
long
as
she
remained
under
the
bad
influence
of
her
mother
i
promised
to
come
and
sup
with
her
next
evening
but
on
the
condition
i
said
that
you
give
me
a
plain
meal
and
one
bottle
of
chambertin
only
for
you
are
not
too
well
off
i
know
that
but
mamma
says
that
you
pay
for
everything
this
reply
made
me
go
off
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
in
spite
of
her
vexation
the
mother
was
obliged
to
follow
my
example
the
poor
woman
hardened
by
the
life
she
led
took
the
child
simplicity
for
stupidity
but
i
saw
in
her
a
rough
diamond
which
only
wanted
polishing
therese
told
me
that
the
wine
did
not
cost
her
anything
as
the
son
of
the
rotterdam
burgomaster
furnished
her
with
it
and
that
he
would
sup
with
us
the
next
day
if
i
would
allow
him
to
be
present
i
answered
smilingly
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
him
and
i
went
away
after
giving
my
daughter
of
whom
i
felt
fond
a
tender
embrace
i
would
have
done
anything
to
be
entrusted
with
her
but
i
saw
it
would
be
no
good
trying
to
get
possession
of
her
as
the
mother
was
evidently
keeping
her
as
a
resource
for
her
old
age
this
is
a
common
way
for
adventuresses
to
look
upon
their
daughters
and
therese
was
an
adventuress
in
the
widest
acceptation
of
the
term
i
gave
her
twenty
ducats
to
get
clothes
for
my
adopted
son
and
sophie
who
with
spontaneous
gratitude
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
came
and
gave
me
a
kiss
joseph
was
going
to
kiss
my
hand
but
i
told
him
that
it
was
degrading
for
one
man
to
kiss
hand
and
that
for
the
future
he
was
to
shew
his
gratitude
by
embracing
me
as
a
son
embraces
his
father
just
as
i
was
leaving
therese
took
me
to
the
closet
where
the
two
children
were
sleeping
i
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
but
all
that
was
over
long
ago
i
could
think
of
no
one
but
esther
the
next
day
i
found
the
burgomaster
son
at
my
actress
house
he
was
a
fine
young
fellow
of
twenty
or
but
totally
devoid
of
manner
he
was
therese
lover
but
he
should
have
regulated
his
behaviour
in
my
presence
therese
seeing
that
he
was
posing
as
master
of
the
field
and
that
his
manners
disgusted
me
began
to
snub
him
much
to
his
displeasure
and
after
sneering
at
the
poorness
of
the
dishes
and
praising
the
wine
which
he
had
supplied
he
went
out
leaving
us
to
finish
our
dessert
by
ourselves
i
left
myself
at
eleven
telling
therese
that
i
should
see
her
again
before
i
went
away
the
princesse
de
galitzin
a
cantimir
by
birth
had
asked
me
to
dinner
and
this
made
me
lose
another
day
next
day
i
heard
from
madame
who
enclosed
a
bill
of
exchange
on
boaz
for
twelve
thousand
francs
she
said
that
she
had
bought
her
shares
for
sixty
thousand
that
she
did
not
wish
to
make
anything
of
them
and
that
she
hoped
i
would
accept
the
overplus
as
my
broker
fee
she
worded
her
offer
with
too
much
courtesy
for
me
to
refuse
it
the
remainder
of
the
letter
was
devoted
to
the
wildest
fancies
she
said
that
her
genius
had
revealed
to
her
that
i
should
bring
back
to
paris
a
boy
born
of
the
mystical
marriage
and
she
hoped
i
would
take
pity
on
her
it
was
a
strange
coincidence
and
seemed
likely
to
attach
the
woman
still
more
closely
to
her
visionary
theories
i
laughed
when
i
though
how
she
would
be
impressed
by
therese
son
who
was
certainly
not
born
of
the
mystical
marriage
boaz
paid
me
my
twelve
thousand
francs
in
ducats
and
i
made
him
my
friend
as
he
thanked
me
for
receiving
the
moneys
in
ducats
and
he
doubtless
made
a
profit
on
the
transaction
gold
being
a
commodity
in
holland
and
all
payments
being
made
in
silver
or
paper
money
at
that
time
gold
was
at
a
low
rate
and
nobody
would
take
ducats
after
having
an
excellent
dinner
with
the
princesse
de
galitzin
i
put
on
my
cloak
and
went
to
the
cafe
i
found
there
the
burgomaster
son
who
was
just
beginning
a
game
of
billiards
he
whispered
to
me
that
i
might
back
him
with
advantage
and
thinking
he
was
sure
of
his
stroke
i
thanked
him
and
followed
his
advice
however
after
losing
three
games
one
after
the
other
i
took
his
measure
and
began
to
lay
against
him
without
his
knowledge
after
playing
for
three
hours
and
losing
all
the
time
he
stopped
play
and
came
to
condole
with
me
on
my
heavy
loss
it
is
impossible
to
describe
his
amazed
expression
when
i
shewed
him
a
handful
of
ducats
and
assured
him
that
i
had
spent
a
very
profitable
evening
in
laying
against
him
everybody
in
the
room
began
to
laugh
at
him
but
he
was
the
sort
of
young
man
who
does
understand
a
joke
and
he
went
out
in
a
rage
soon
after
i
left
the
myself
and
according
to
my
promise
went
to
see
therese
as
i
was
leaving
for
amsterdam
the
next
day
therese
was
waiting
for
her
young
wine
merchant
but
on
my
recounting
his
adventures
she
expected
him
no
longer
i
took
my
little
daughter
on
my
knee
and
lavished
my
caresses
on
her
and
so
left
them
telling
them
that
we
should
see
each
other
again
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
or
a
month
at
latest
as
i
was
going
home
in
the
moonlight
by
myself
my
sword
under
my
arm
i
was
encountered
all
of
a
sudden
by
the
poor
dupe
of
a
burgomaster
son
i
want
to
know
said
he
if
your
sword
has
as
sharp
a
point
as
your
tongue
i
tried
to
quiet
him
by
speaking
common
sense
and
i
kept
my
sword
wrapped
in
my
cloak
though
his
was
bared
and
directed
against
me
you
are
wrong
to
take
my
jests
in
such
bad
part
said
i
however
i
apologize
to
you
no
apologies
look
to
yourself
wait
till
you
will
be
cooler
then
but
if
you
still
wish
it
i
will
give
you
satisfaction
in
the
midst
of
the
the
only
satisfaction
you
can
give
me
is
to
fight
i
want
to
kill
you
as
evidence
of
his
determination
and
to
provoke
me
beyond
recall
he
struck
me
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
in
which
i
have
received
such
and
insult
i
drew
my
sword
but
still
hoping
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
i
kept
strictly
on
the
defensive
and
endeavoured
to
make
him
leave
off
this
conduct
the
dutchman
mistook
for
fear
and
pushed
hard
on
me
lunging
in
a
manner
that
made
me
look
to
myself
his
sword
passed
through
my
necktie
a
quarter
of
an
inch
farther
in
would
have
done
my
business
i
leapt
to
one
side
and
my
danger
no
longer
admitting
of
my
fighting
on
the
defensive
i
lunged
out
and
wounded
him
in
the
chest
i
thought
this
would
have
been
enough
for
him
so
i
proposed
we
should
terminate
our
engagement
i
not
dead
yet
said
he
i
want
to
kill
you
this
was
his
watchword
and
as
he
leapt
on
me
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
more
like
a
madman
than
a
sensible
being
i
hit
him
four
times
at
the
fourth
wound
he
stepped
back
and
saying
he
had
had
enough
begged
me
to
leave
him
i
went
off
as
fast
as
i
could
and
was
very
glad
to
see
from
the
look
of
my
sword
that
his
wounds
were
slight
i
found
boaz
still
up
and
on
hearing
what
had
taken
place
he
advised
me
to
go
to
amsterdam
at
once
though
i
assured
him
that
the
wounds
were
not
mortal
i
gave
in
to
his
advice
and
as
my
carriage
was
at
the
saddler
he
lent
me
his
and
i
set
out
bidding
my
servant
to
come
on
the
next
day
with
my
luggage
and
to
rejoin
me
at
the
old
bible
in
amsterdam
i
reached
amsterdam
at
noon
and
my
man
arrived
in
the
evening
i
was
curious
to
hear
if
my
duel
had
made
any
noise
but
as
my
servant
had
left
at
an
early
hour
he
had
heard
nothing
about
it
fortunately
for
me
nothing
whatever
was
known
about
it
at
amsterdam
for
a
week
after
otherwise
things
might
not
have
gone
well
with
me
as
the
reputation
of
being
a
duellist
is
not
a
recommendation
to
financiers
with
whom
one
is
about
to
transact
business
of
importance
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
tell
him
that
my
first
call
was
on
or
rather
on
his
charming
daughter
esther
for
she
it
was
on
whom
i
waited
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
way
in
which
we
parted
did
a
good
deal
towards
augmenting
the
warmth
of
my
affection
for
her
on
entering
the
room
i
found
esther
writing
at
a
table
what
are
you
doing
esther
dear
an
arithmetical
problem
do
you
like
problems
i
am
passionately
fond
of
anything
which
contains
difficulties
and
offers
curious
results
i
will
give
you
something
which
will
please
you
i
made
her
by
way
of
jest
two
magic
squares
which
delighted
her
in
return
she
spewed
me
some
trifles
with
which
i
was
well
acquainted
but
which
i
pretended
to
think
very
astonishing
my
good
genius
then
inspired
me
with
the
idea
of
trying
divination
by
the
cabala
i
told
her
to
ask
a
question
in
writing
and
assured
her
that
by
a
certain
kind
of
calculation
a
satisfactory
answer
would
be
obtained
she
smiled
and
asked
why
i
had
returned
to
amsterdam
so
soon
i
shewed
her
how
to
make
the
pyramid
with
the
proper
numbers
and
the
other
ceremonies
then
i
made
her
extract
the
answer
in
numbers
translating
it
into
french
and
greatly
was
she
surprised
to
find
that
the
cause
which
had
made
me
return
to
amsterdam
so
soon
was
love
quite
confounded
she
said
it
was
very
wonderful
even
though
the
answer
might
not
be
true
and
she
wished
to
know
what
masters
could
teach
this
mode
of
calculation
those
who
know
it
can
not
teach
it
to
anyone
how
did
you
learn
it
then
from
a
precious
manuscript
i
inherited
from
my
father
sell
it
me
i
have
burnt
it
and
i
am
not
empowered
to
communicate
the
secret
to
anyone
before
i
reach
the
age
of
fifty
why
fifty
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
that
if
i
communicated
it
to
anyone
before
that
age
i
should
run
the
risk
of
losing
it
myself
the
elementary
spirit
who
is
attached
to
the
oracle
would
leave
it
how
do
you
know
that
i
saw
it
so
stated
in
the
manuscript
i
have
spoken
of
then
you
are
able
to
discover
all
secrets
yes
or
i
should
be
if
the
replies
were
not
sometimes
too
obscure
to
be
understood
as
it
does
not
take
much
time
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
get
me
an
answer
to
another
question
with
pleasure
you
can
command
me
in
anything
not
forbidden
by
my
familiar
spirit
she
asked
what
her
destiny
would
be
and
the
oracle
replied
that
she
had
not
yet
taken
the
first
step
towards
it
esther
was
astonished
and
called
her
governess
to
see
the
two
answers
but
the
good
woman
saw
nothing
wonderful
in
them
whatever
esther
impatiently
called
her
a
blockhead
and
entreated
me
to
let
her
ask
another
question
i
begged
her
to
do
so
and
she
asked
who
loves
me
most
in
amsterdam
the
oracle
replied
that
no
one
loved
her
as
well
as
he
who
had
given
her
being
poor
esther
then
told
me
that
i
had
made
her
miserable
and
that
she
would
die
of
grief
if
she
could
not
succeed
in
learning
the
method
of
calculation
i
gave
no
answer
and
pretended
to
feel
sad
at
heart
she
began
to
write
down
another
question
putting
her
hand
in
front
so
as
to
screen
the
paper
i
rose
as
if
to
get
out
of
her
way
but
while
she
was
arranging
the
pyramid
i
cast
my
eyes
on
the
paper
whilst
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
read
her
question
after
she
had
gone
as
far
as
i
had
taught
her
she
asked
me
to
extract
the
answer
saying
that
i
could
do
so
without
reading
the
question
i
agreed
to
do
so
on
the
condition
that
she
would
not
ask
a
second
time
as
i
had
seen
her
question
it
was
easy
for
me
to
answer
it
she
had
asked
the
oracle
if
she
might
shew
the
questions
she
had
propounded
to
her
father
and
the
answer
was
that
she
would
be
happy
as
long
as
she
had
no
secrets
from
her
father
when
she
read
these
words
she
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
could
find
no
words
wherewith
to
express
her
gratitude
to
me
i
left
her
for
the
exchange
where
i
had
a
long
business
conversation
with
pels
next
morning
a
handsome
and
gentlemanly
man
came
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
therese
who
told
me
that
he
would
be
useful
in
case
i
wanted
any
assistance
in
business
his
name
was
rigerboos
she
informed
me
that
the
burgomaster
son
was
only
slightly
wounded
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
as
the
matter
was
not
generally
known
and
that
if
i
had
business
at
the
hague
i
might
return
there
in
perfect
safety
she
said
that
my
little
sophie
talked
of
me
all
day
and
that
i
should
find
my
son
much
improved
on
my
return
i
asked
rigerboos
to
give
me
his
address
assuring
him
that
at
the
proper
time
i
should
rely
on
his
services
a
moment
after
rigerboos
had
gone
i
got
a
short
note
from
esther
who
begged
me
in
her
father
name
to
spend
the
day
with
her
at
least
if
i
had
no
important
engagement
i
answered
that
excepting
a
certain
matter
of
which
her
father
knew
i
had
no
chiefer
aim
than
to
convince
her
that
i
desired
a
place
in
her
heart
and
that
she
might
be
quite
sure
that
i
would
not
refuse
her
invitation
i
went
to
at
dinner
time
i
found
esther
and
her
father
puzzling
over
the
method
which
drew
reasonable
answers
out
of
a
pyramid
of
numbers
as
soon
as
her
father
saw
me
he
embraced
me
saying
how
happy
he
was
to
possess
a
daughter
capable
of
attracting
me
she
will
attract
any
man
who
has
sufficient
sense
to
appreciate
her
you
appreciate
her
then
i
worship
her
then
embrace
her
esther
opened
her
arms
and
with
a
cry
of
delight
threw
them
round
my
neck
and
gave
the
back
all
my
caresses
kiss
for
kiss
i
have
got
through
all
my
business
said
and
the
rest
of
my
day
is
at
your
disposal
i
have
known
from
my
childhood
that
there
is
such
a
science
as
the
one
you
profess
and
i
was
acquainted
with
a
jew
who
by
its
aid
made
an
immense
fortune
he
like
you
said
that
under
pain
of
losing
the
secret
it
could
only
be
communicated
to
one
person
but
he
put
off
doing
so
so
long
that
at
last
it
was
too
late
for
a
high
fever
carried
him
off
in
a
few
days
i
hope
you
will
not
do
as
the
jew
did
but
in
the
meanwhile
allow
me
to
say
that
if
you
do
not
draw
a
profit
from
this
treasure
you
do
not
know
what
it
really
is
you
call
this
knowledge
of
mine
a
treasure
and
yet
you
possess
one
far
more
excellent
looking
at
esther
as
i
spoke
we
will
discuss
that
again
yes
sir
i
call
your
science
a
treasure
but
the
answers
of
the
oracle
are
often
very
obscure
obscure
the
answers
my
daughter
received
are
as
clear
as
day
apparently
she
is
fortunate
in
the
way
she
frames
her
questions
for
on
this
the
reply
depends
after
dinner
we
will
try
if
i
am
so
fortunate
at
least
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
help
me
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
as
i
consider
father
and
daughter
as
one
being
at
table
we
discussed
other
subjects
as
the
chief
clerks
were
present
notably
the
manager
a
fellow
who
had
very
evident
aspirations
in
the
direction
of
my
fair
esther
after
dinner
we
went
into
private
closet
and
thereupon
he
drew
two
long
questions
out
of
his
pocket
in
the
first
he
desired
to
know
how
to
obtain
a
favourable
decision
from
the
in
an
important
matter
the
details
of
which
he
explained
i
replied
in
terms
the
obscurity
of
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
professed
pythoness
and
i
left
esther
to
translate
the
answer
into
common
sense
and
find
a
meaning
in
it
with
regard
to
the
second
answer
i
acted
in
a
different
manner
i
was
impelled
to
answer
clearly
and
did
so
asked
what
had
become
of
a
vessel
belonging
to
the
india
company
of
which
nothing
had
been
heard
it
was
known
to
have
started
on
the
return
voyage
and
should
have
arrived
two
months
ago
and
this
delay
gave
rise
to
the
supposition
that
it
had
gone
down
wished
to
know
if
it
were
still
above
water
or
whether
it
were
lost
etc
as
no
tidings
of
it
had
come
to
hand
the
company
were
on
the
for
someone
to
insure
it
and
offered
ten
per
but
nobody
cared
to
run
so
great
a
risk
especially
as
a
letter
had
been
received
from
an
english
sea
captain
who
said
he
had
seen
her
sink
i
may
confess
to
my
readers
though
i
did
not
do
so
to
that
with
inexplicable
folly
i
composed
an
answer
that
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
safety
of
the
vessel
pronouncing
it
safe
and
sound
and
that
we
should
hear
of
it
in
a
few
days
no
doubt
i
felt
the
need
of
exalting
my
oracle
but
this
method
was
likely
to
destroy
its
credit
for
ever
in
truth
if
i
had
guessed
design
i
would
have
curbed
my
vanity
for
i
had
no
wish
to
make
him
lose
a
large
sum
without
profiting
myself
the
answer
made
him
turn
pale
and
tremble
with
joy
he
told
us
that
secrecy
in
the
matter
was
of
the
last
importance
as
he
had
determined
to
insure
the
vessel
and
drive
a
good
bargain
at
this
dreading
the
consequences
i
hastened
to
tell
him
that
for
all
i
knew
there
might
not
be
a
word
of
truth
in
the
oracle
reply
and
that
i
should
die
of
grief
if
i
were
the
involuntary
cause
of
his
losing
an
enormous
sum
of
money
through
relying
on
an
oracle
the
hidden
sense
of
which
might
be
completely
opposed
to
the
literal
translation
have
you
ever
been
deceived
by
it
often
seeing
my
distress
esther
begged
her
father
to
take
no
further
steps
in
the
matter
for
some
moments
nobody
spoke
looked
thoughtful
and
full
of
the
project
which
his
fancy
had
painted
in
such
gay
colours
he
said
a
good
deal
about
it
dwelling
on
the
mystic
virtues
of
numbers
and
told
his
daughter
to
read
out
all
the
questions
she
had
addressed
to
the
oracle
with
the
answers
she
had
received
there
were
six
or
seven
of
them
all
briefly
worded
some
direct
and
some
equivocal
esther
who
had
constructed
the
pyramids
had
shone
with
my
potent
assistance
in
extracting
the
answers
which
i
had
really
invented
and
her
father
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
seeing
her
so
clever
imagined
that
she
would
become
an
adept
in
the
science
by
the
force
of
intelligence
the
lovely
esther
who
was
much
taken
with
the
trifle
was
quite
ready
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
after
passing
several
hours
in
the
discussion
of
the
answers
which
my
host
thought
divine
we
had
supper
and
at
parting
said
that
as
sunday
was
a
day
for
pleasure
and
not
business
he
hoped
i
would
honour
them
by
passing
the
day
at
their
pretty
house
on
the
amstel
and
they
were
delighted
at
my
accepting
their
invitation
i
could
not
help
pondering
over
the
mysteries
of
the
commercial
mind
which
narrows
itself
down
to
considerations
of
profit
and
loss
was
decidedly
an
honest
man
but
although
he
was
rich
he
was
by
no
means
devoid
of
the
greed
incident
to
his
profession
i
asked
myself
the
question
how
a
man
who
would
consider
it
dishonourable
to
steal
a
ducat
or
to
pick
one
up
in
the
street
and
keep
it
knowing
to
whom
it
belonged
could
reconcile
it
with
his
conscience
to
make
an
enormous
profit
by
insuring
a
vessel
of
the
safety
of
which
he
was
perfectly
certain
as
he
believed
the
oracle
infallible
such
a
transaction
was
certainly
fraudulent
as
it
is
dishonest
to
play
when
one
is
certain
of
winning
as
i
was
going
home
i
passed
a
and
seeing
a
good
many
people
going
in
and
coming
out
i
went
in
curious
to
know
how
these
places
were
managed
in
holland
great
heavens
i
found
myself
the
witness
of
an
orgy
the
scene
a
sort
of
cellar
a
perfect
cesspool
of
vice
and
debauchery
the
discordant
noise
of
the
two
or
three
instruments
which
formed
the
orchestra
struck
gloom
to
the
soul
and
added
to
the
horrors
of
the
cavern
the
air
was
dense
with
the
fumes
of
bad
tobacco
and
vapours
reeking
of
beer
and
garlic
issued
from
every
mouth
the
company
consisted
of
sailors
men
of
the
and
a
number
of
vile
women
the
sailors
and
the
dregs
of
the
people
thought
this
den
a
garden
of
delight
and
considered
its
pleasures
compensation
for
the
toils
of
the
sea
and
the
miseries
of
daily
labour
there
was
not
a
single
woman
there
whose
aspect
had
anything
redeeming
about
it
i
was
looking
at
the
repulsive
sight
in
silence
when
a
great
hulking
fellow
whose
appearance
suggested
the
blacksmith
and
his
voice
the
blackguard
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
in
bad
italian
if
i
would
like
to
dance
i
answered
in
the
negative
but
before
leaving
me
he
pointed
out
a
venetian
woman
who
he
said
would
oblige
me
if
i
gave
her
some
drink
wishing
to
discover
if
she
was
anyone
i
knew
i
looked
at
her
attentively
and
seemed
to
recollect
her
features
although
i
could
not
decide
who
she
could
be
feeling
rather
curious
on
the
subject
i
sat
down
next
to
her
and
asked
if
she
came
from
venice
and
if
she
had
left
that
country
some
time
ago
nearly
eighteen
years
she
replied
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
and
asked
if
she
would
take
any
she
said
yes
and
added
if
i
liked
she
would
oblige
me
i
have
time
i
said
and
i
gave
the
poor
wretch
the
change
i
received
from
the
waiter
she
was
full
of
gratitude
and
would
have
embraced
me
if
i
had
allowed
her
do
you
like
being
at
amsterdam
better
than
venice
i
asked
alas
no
for
if
i
were
in
my
own
country
i
should
not
be
following
this
dreadful
trade
how
old
were
you
when
you
left
venice
i
was
only
fourteen
and
lived
happily
with
my
father
and
mother
who
now
may
have
died
of
grief
who
seduced
you
a
rascally
footman
in
what
part
of
venice
did
you
live
i
did
not
live
in
venice
but
at
friuli
not
far
off
friuli
eighteen
years
ago
a
footman
i
felt
moved
and
looking
at
the
wretched
woman
more
closely
i
soon
recognized
in
her
lucie
of
pasean
i
can
not
describe
my
sorrow
which
i
concealed
as
best
i
could
and
tried
hard
to
keep
up
my
indifferent
air
a
life
of
debauchery
rather
than
the
flight
of
time
had
tarnished
her
beauty
and
ruined
the
once
exquisite
outlines
of
her
form
lucie
that
innocent
and
pretty
maiden
grown
ugly
vile
a
common
prostitute
it
was
a
dreadful
thought
she
drank
like
a
sailor
without
looking
at
me
and
without
caring
who
i
was
i
took
a
few
ducats
from
my
purse
and
slipped
them
into
her
hand
and
without
waiting
for
her
to
find
out
how
much
i
had
given
her
i
left
that
horrible
den
i
went
to
bed
full
of
saddening
thoughts
not
even
under
the
leads
did
i
pass
so
wretched
a
day
i
thought
i
must
have
risen
under
some
unhappy
star
i
loathed
myself
with
regard
to
lucie
i
felt
the
sting
of
remorse
but
at
the
thought
of
i
hated
myself
i
considered
that
i
should
cause
him
a
loss
of
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
florins
and
the
thought
was
a
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
of
my
affection
for
esther
i
fancied
she
as
well
as
her
father
would
become
my
implacable
foe
and
love
that
is
not
returned
is
no
love
at
all
i
spent
a
dreadful
night
lucie
esther
her
father
their
hatred
of
me
and
my
hatred
of
myself
were
the
groundwork
of
my
dreams
i
saw
esther
and
her
father
if
not
ruined
at
all
events
impoverished
by
my
fault
and
lucie
only
years
old
and
already
deep
in
the
abyss
of
vice
with
an
infinite
prospect
of
misery
and
shame
before
her
the
dawn
was
welcome
indeed
for
with
its
appearance
a
calm
came
to
my
spirit
it
is
the
darkness
which
is
terrible
to
a
heart
full
of
remorse
i
got
up
and
dressed
myself
in
my
best
and
went
in
a
coach
to
do
my
suit
to
the
princesse
de
galitzin
who
was
staying
at
the
etoile
i
found
her
out
she
had
gone
to
the
admiralty
i
went
there
and
found
her
accompanied
by
de
reissak
and
the
count
de
tot
who
had
just
received
news
of
my
friend
pesselier
at
whose
house
i
made
his
acquaintance
and
who
was
dangerously
ill
when
i
left
paris
i
sent
away
my
coach
and
began
to
walk
towards
house
on
the
amsel
the
extreme
elegance
of
my
costume
was
displeasing
in
the
eyes
of
the
dutch
populace
and
they
hissed
and
hooted
me
after
the
manner
of
the
mob
all
the
world
over
esther
saw
me
coming
from
the
window
drew
the
rope
and
opened
the
door
i
ran
in
shut
the
door
behind
me
and
as
i
was
going
up
the
wooden
staircase
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
step
my
foot
struck
against
some
yielding
substance
i
looked
down
and
saw
a
green
i
stooped
down
to
pick
it
up
but
was
awkward
enough
to
send
it
through
an
opening
in
the
stairs
which
had
been
doubtless
made
for
the
purpose
of
giving
light
to
a
stair
below
i
did
not
stop
but
went
up
the
steps
and
was
received
with
the
usual
hospitality
and
on
their
expressing
some
wonder
as
to
the
unusual
brilliance
of
my
attire
i
explained
the
circumstances
of
the
case
esther
smiled
and
said
i
looked
quite
another
person
but
i
saw
that
both
father
and
daughter
were
sad
at
heart
esther
governess
came
in
and
said
something
to
her
in
dutch
at
which
in
evident
distress
she
ran
and
embraced
her
father
i
see
my
friends
that
something
has
happened
to
you
if
my
presence
is
a
restraint
treat
me
without
ceremony
and
bid
me
go
it
not
so
great
an
after
all
i
have
enough
money
left
to
bear
the
loss
patiently
if
i
may
ask
the
question
what
is
the
nature
of
your
loss
i
have
lost
a
green
containing
a
good
deal
of
money
which
if
i
had
been
wise
i
would
have
left
behind
as
i
did
not
require
it
till
and
you
do
know
where
you
lost
it
it
must
have
been
in
the
street
but
i
ca
imagine
how
it
can
have
happened
it
contained
bills
of
exchange
for
large
amounts
and
of
course
they
do
matter
as
i
can
stop
payment
of
them
but
there
were
also
notes
of
the
bank
of
england
for
heavy
sums
and
they
are
gone
as
they
are
payable
to
the
bearer
let
us
give
thanks
to
god
my
dear
child
that
it
is
no
worse
and
pray
to
him
to
preserve
to
us
what
remains
and
above
all
to
keep
us
in
good
health
i
have
had
much
heavier
losses
than
this
and
i
have
been
enabled
not
only
to
bear
the
misfortune
but
to
make
up
the
loss
let
us
say
no
more
about
the
matter
while
he
was
speaking
my
heart
was
full
of
joy
but
i
kept
up
the
sadness
befitting
the
scene
i
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
in
question
was
the
one
i
had
unluckily
sent
through
the
staircase
but
which
could
not
be
lost
irretrievably
my
first
point
was
how
to
make
capital
of
my
grand
discovery
in
the
interests
of
my
cabalistic
science
it
was
too
fine
an
opportunity
to
be
lost
especially
as
i
still
felt
the
sting
of
having
been
the
cause
of
an
enormous
loss
to
the
worthy
man
i
would
give
them
a
grand
proof
of
the
infallibility
of
my
oracle
how
many
miracles
are
done
in
the
same
way
the
thought
put
me
into
a
good
humour
i
began
to
crack
jokes
and
my
jests
drew
peals
of
laughter
from
esther
we
had
an
excellent
dinner
and
choice
wine
after
we
had
taken
coffee
i
said
that
if
they
liked
we
would
have
a
game
of
cards
but
esther
said
that
this
would
be
a
waste
of
time
as
she
would
much
prefer
making
the
oracular
pyramids
this
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
with
all
my
heart
i
said
we
will
do
as
you
suggest
shall
i
ask
where
my
father
lost
his
why
not
it
a
plain
question
write
it
down
she
made
the
pyramid
and
the
reply
was
that
the
had
not
been
found
by
anyone
she
leapt
up
from
her
seat
danced
for
joy
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
saying
we
shall
find
it
we
shall
find
it
papa
i
hope
so
too
my
dear
that
answer
is
really
very
consoling
wherewith
esther
gave
her
father
one
kiss
after
another
yes
said
i
there
is
certainly
ground
for
hope
but
the
oracle
will
be
dumb
to
all
questions
dumb
why
i
was
going
to
say
it
will
be
dumb
if
you
do
not
give
me
as
many
kisses
as
you
have
given
your
father
oh
then
i
will
soon
make
it
speak
said
she
laughing
and
throwing
her
arms
about
my
neck
she
began
to
kiss
me
and
i
to
give
her
kisses
in
return
ah
what
happy
days
they
seem
when
i
recall
them
and
still
i
like
dwelling
on
these
days
despite
my
sad
old
age
the
foe
of
love
when
i
recall
these
events
i
grow
young
again
and
feel
once
more
the
delights
of
youth
despite
the
long
years
which
separate
me
from
that
happy
time
at
last
esther
sat
down
again
and
asked
where
is
the
and
the
pyramid
told
her
that
the
had
fallen
through
the
opening
in
the
fifth
step
of
the
staircase
said
to
his
daughter
come
my
dear
esther
let
us
go
and
test
the
truth
of
the
oracle
and
full
of
joy
and
hope
they
went
to
the
staircase
i
following
them
and
shewed
her
the
hole
through
which
the
must
have
fallen
he
lighted
a
candle
and
we
went
down
to
the
cellar
and
before
long
he
picked
up
the
book
which
had
fallen
into
some
water
we
went
up
again
in
high
spirits
and
there
we
talked
for
over
an
hour
as
seriously
as
you
please
on
the
divine
powers
of
the
oracle
which
according
to
them
should
render
its
possessor
the
happiest
of
mortals
he
opened
the
and
shewed
us
the
four
thousand
pound
notes
he
gave
two
to
his
daughter
and
made
me
take
the
two
remaining
but
i
took
them
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
gave
them
to
esther
begging
her
to
keep
them
for
me
but
before
she
would
agree
to
do
so
i
had
to
threaten
her
with
the
stoppage
of
the
famous
cabalistic
oracle
i
told
that
all
i
asked
was
his
friendship
and
thereon
he
embraced
me
and
swore
to
be
my
friend
to
the
death
by
making
the
fair
esther
the
depositary
of
my
two
thousand
pounds
i
was
sure
of
winning
her
affection
by
an
appeal
not
to
her
interest
but
to
her
truthfulness
this
charming
girl
had
about
her
so
powerful
an
attraction
that
i
felt
as
if
my
life
was
wound
up
with
hers
i
told
that
my
chief
object
was
to
negotiate
the
twenty
millions
at
a
small
loss
i
hope
to
be
of
service
to
you
in
the
matter
he
said
but
as
shall
often
want
to
speak
to
you
you
must
come
and
live
in
our
house
which
you
must
look
upon
as
your
own
my
presence
will
be
a
restraint
on
you
i
shall
be
a
trouble
ask
esther
esther
joined
her
entreaties
to
her
father
and
i
gave
in
taking
good
care
not
to
let
them
see
how
pleased
i
was
i
contented
myself
with
expressing
my
gratitude
to
which
they
answered
that
it
was
i
who
conferred
a
favour
went
into
his
closet
and
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
alone
with
esther
i
kissed
her
tenderly
saying
that
i
should
not
be
happy
till
i
had
won
her
heart
do
you
love
me
dearly
and
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
shew
how
well
i
love
you
if
you
will
love
me
in
return
she
gave
me
her
hand
which
i
covered
with
kisses
and
she
went
on
to
say
as
soon
as
you
come
and
live
with
us
you
must
look
out
for
a
good
opportunity
for
asking
my
hand
of
my
father
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
will
refuse
you
but
the
first
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
move
into
our
house
my
dear
little
wife
i
will
come
we
said
many
sweet
things
to
one
another
talked
about
the
future
and
told
each
other
our
inmost
thoughts
and
i
was
undoubtedly
truly
in
love
for
not
a
single
improper
fancy
rose
in
my
mind
in
the
presence
of
my
dear
who
loved
me
so
well
the
first
thing
that
said
on
his
return
was
that
there
would
be
a
piece
of
news
on
the
exchange
the
next
day
what
is
that
papa
dear
i
have
decided
to
take
the
whole
risk
amounting
to
three
hundred
thousand
the
ship
which
is
thought
to
have
gone
down
they
will
call
me
mad
but
they
themselves
will
be
the
madmen
which
is
what
i
should
be
if
after
the
proof
we
have
had
i
doubted
the
oracle
any
more
my
dear
sir
you
make
me
frightened
i
have
told
you
that
i
have
been
often
deceived
by
the
oracle
that
must
have
been
my
dear
fellow
when
the
reply
was
obscure
and
you
did
not
get
at
the
real
sense
of
it
but
in
the
present
case
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
i
shall
make
three
million
florins
or
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worse
my
loss
wo
ruin
me
esther
whom
the
finding
of
the
had
made
enthusiastic
told
her
father
to
lose
no
time
as
for
me
i
could
not
recall
what
i
had
done
but
i
was
again
overwhelmed
with
sadness
saw
it
and
taking
my
hand
said
if
the
oracle
does
lie
this
time
i
shall
be
none
the
less
your
friend
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
answered
but
as
this
is
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
let
me
consult
the
oracle
a
second
time
before
you
risk
your
three
hundred
thousand
florins
this
proposition
pleased
the
father
and
daughter
highly
they
could
not
express
their
gratitude
to
me
for
being
so
careful
of
their
interests
what
followed
was
truly
surprising
enough
to
make
one
believe
in
fatality
my
readers
probably
will
not
believe
it
but
as
these
memoirs
will
not
be
published
till
i
have
left
this
world
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
me
to
disguise
the
truth
in
any
way
especially
as
the
writing
of
them
is
only
the
amusement
of
my
leisure
hours
well
let
him
who
will
believe
it
this
is
absolutely
what
happened
i
wrote
down
the
question
myself
erected
the
pyramid
and
carried
out
all
the
magical
ceremonies
without
letting
esther
have
a
hand
in
it
i
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
check
an
act
of
extreme
imprudence
and
i
was
determined
to
do
so
a
double
meaning
which
i
knew
how
to
get
would
abate
courage
and
annihilate
his
plans
i
had
thought
over
what
i
wanted
to
say
and
i
thought
i
had
expressed
it
properly
in
the
numbers
with
that
idea
as
esther
knew
the
alphabet
perfectly
well
i
let
her
extract
the
answer
and
transfer
it
into
letters
what
was
my
surprise
when
i
heard
her
read
these
words
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
neither
fear
nor
hesitate
your
repentance
would
be
too
hard
for
you
to
bear
that
was
enough
father
and
daughter
ran
to
embrace
me
and
that
when
the
vessel
was
sighted
a
tithe
of
the
profits
should
be
mine
my
surprise
prevented
me
giving
any
answer
i
had
intended
to
write
trust
and
hazard
and
i
had
written
fear
and
hesitate
but
thanks
to
his
prejudice
only
saw
in
my
silence
confirmation
of
the
infallibility
of
the
oracle
in
short
i
could
do
nothing
more
and
i
took
my
leave
leaving
everything
to
the
care
of
chance
who
sometimes
is
kind
to
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
the
next
morning
i
took
up
my
abode
in
a
splendid
suite
of
rooms
in
esther
house
and
the
day
after
i
took
her
to
a
concert
where
she
joked
with
me
on
the
grief
i
should
endure
on
account
of
the
absence
of
madame
trend
and
my
daughter
esther
was
the
only
mistress
of
my
soul
i
lived
but
to
adore
her
and
i
should
have
satisfied
my
love
had
not
esther
been
a
girl
of
good
principles
i
could
not
gain
possession
of
her
and
was
full
of
longing
and
desire
four
or
five
days
after
my
installation
in
my
new
quarters
to
me
the
result
of
a
conference
which
he
had
had
with
pels
and
six
other
bankers
on
the
twenty
millions
they
offered
ten
millions
in
hard
cash
and
seven
millions
in
paper
money
bearing
interest
at
five
or
six
per
cent
with
a
deduction
of
one
per
cent
brokerage
furthermore
they
would
forgive
a
sum
of
twelve
hundred
thousand
florins
owed
by
the
french
india
company
to
the
dutch
company
with
such
conditions
i
could
not
venture
to
decide
on
my
own
responsibility
although
personally
i
thought
them
reasonable
enough
the
impoverished
state
of
the
french
treasury
being
taken
into
consideration
i
sent
copies
of
the
proposal
to
de
boulogne
and
begging
from
them
an
immediate
reply
at
the
end
of
a
week
i
received
an
answer
in
the
writing
of
de
courteil
acting
for
de
boulogne
instructing
me
to
refuse
absolutely
any
such
proposal
and
to
report
myself
at
paris
if
i
saw
no
chance
of
making
a
better
bargain
i
was
again
informed
that
peace
was
imminent
though
the
dutch
were
quite
of
another
opinion
in
all
probability
i
should
have
immediately
left
for
paris
but
for
a
circumstance
which
astonished
nobody
but
myself
in
the
family
of
which
i
had
become
a
member
the
confidence
of
increased
every
day
and
as
if
chance
was
determined
to
make
me
a
prophet
in
spite
of
myself
news
was
received
of
the
ship
which
was
believed
to
be
lost
and
which
on
the
faith
of
my
oracle
had
bought
for
three
hundred
thousand
florins
the
vessel
was
at
madeira
the
joy
of
esther
and
still
more
my
own
may
be
imagined
when
we
saw
the
worthy
man
enter
the
house
triumphantly
with
confirmation
of
the
good
news
i
have
insured
the
vessel
from
madeira
to
the
mouth
of
the
texel
for
a
trifle
said
he
and
so
turning
to
me
you
may
count
from
this
moment
on
the
tenth
part
of
the
profit
which
i
owe
entirely
to
you
the
reader
may
imagine
my
delight
but
there
is
one
thing
he
will
not
imagine
unless
he
knows
my
character
better
than
i
do
myself
the
confusion
into
which
i
was
thrown
by
the
following
remarks
you
are
now
rich
enough
said
to
set
up
for
yourself
amongst
us
and
you
are
positively
certain
to
make
an
enormous
fortune
in
a
short
time
merely
by
making
use
of
your
cabala
i
will
be
your
agent
let
us
live
together
and
if
you
like
my
daughter
as
she
likes
you
you
can
call
yourself
my
son
as
soon
as
you
please
in
esther
face
shone
forth
joy
and
happiness
and
in
mine
though
i
adored
her
there
was
to
be
seen
alas
nothing
but
surprise
i
was
stupid
with
happiness
and
the
constraint
in
which
i
held
myself
i
did
not
analyze
my
feelings
but
though
i
knew
it
not
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
my
insuperable
objection
to
the
marriage
tie
was
working
within
my
soul
a
long
silence
followed
and
last
recovering
my
powers
of
speech
i
succeeded
with
an
effort
in
speaking
to
them
of
my
gratitude
my
happiness
my
love
and
i
ended
by
saying
that
in
spite
of
my
affection
for
esther
i
must
before
settling
in
holland
return
to
paris
and
discharge
the
confidential
and
responsible
duty
which
the
government
had
placed
in
my
hands
i
would
then
return
to
amsterdam
perfectly
independent
this
long
peroration
won
their
approval
esther
was
quite
pleased
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
good
spirits
next
day
a
splendid
dinner
to
several
of
his
friends
who
congratulated
him
on
his
good
fortune
being
persuaded
that
his
courageous
action
was
to
be
explained
by
his
having
had
secret
information
of
the
safety
of
the
vessel
though
none
of
them
could
see
from
what
source
he
and
he
only
had
obtained
it
a
week
after
this
lucky
event
he
gave
me
an
ultimatum
on
the
matter
of
the
twenty
millions
in
which
he
guaranteed
that
france
should
not
lose
more
than
nine
per
cent
in
the
transaction
i
immediately
sent
a
copy
of
his
proposal
to
begging
him
to
be
as
prompt
as
possible
and
another
copy
to
the
with
a
letter
in
which
i
warned
him
that
the
thing
would
certainly
fall
through
if
he
delayed
a
single
day
in
sending
full
powers
to
to
give
me
the
necessary
authority
to
act
i
wrote
to
the
same
effect
to
de
courteil
and
the
duc
de
choiseul
telling
them
that
i
was
to
receive
no
brokerage
but
that
i
should
all
the
same
accept
a
proposal
which
i
thought
a
profitable
one
and
saying
that
i
had
no
doubt
of
obtaining
my
expenses
from
the
french
government
as
it
was
a
time
of
rejoicing
with
us
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
give
a
ball
all
the
most
distinguished
people
in
amsterdam
were
invited
to
it
the
ball
and
supper
were
of
the
most
splendid
description
and
esther
who
was
a
blaze
of
diamonds
danced
all
the
quadrilles
with
me
and
charmed
every
beholder
by
her
grace
and
beauty
i
spent
all
my
time
with
esther
and
every
day
we
grew
more
and
more
in
love
and
more
unhappy
for
we
were
tormented
by
abstinence
which
irritated
while
it
increased
our
desires
esther
was
an
affectionate
mistress
but
discreet
rather
by
training
than
disposition
the
favours
she
accorded
me
were
of
the
most
insignificant
description
she
was
lavish
of
nothing
but
her
kisses
but
kisses
are
rather
irritating
than
soothing
i
used
to
be
nearly
wild
with
love
she
told
me
like
other
virtuous
women
that
if
she
agreed
to
make
me
happy
she
was
sure
i
would
not
marry
her
and
that
as
soon
as
i
made
her
my
wife
she
would
be
mine
and
mine
only
she
did
not
think
i
was
married
for
i
had
given
her
too
many
assurances
to
the
contrary
but
she
thought
i
had
a
strong
attachment
to
someone
in
paris
i
confessed
that
she
was
right
and
said
that
i
was
going
there
to
put
an
end
to
it
that
i
might
be
bound
to
her
alone
alas
i
lied
when
i
said
so
for
esther
was
inseparable
from
her
father
a
man
of
forty
and
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
in
holland
ten
or
twelve
days
after
sending
the
ultimatum
i
received
a
letter
from
de
boulogne
informing
me
that
had
all
necessary
instructions
for
effecting
the
exchange
of
the
twenty
millions
and
another
letter
from
the
ambassador
was
to
the
same
effect
he
warned
me
to
take
care
that
everything
was
right
as
he
should
not
part
with
the
securities
before
receiving
francs
in
current
money
the
sad
time
of
parting
at
last
drew
near
amid
many
regrets
and
tears
from
all
of
us
esther
gave
me
the
two
thousand
pounds
i
had
won
so
easily
and
her
father
at
my
request
gave
me
bills
of
exchange
to
the
amount
of
a
hundred
thousand
florins
with
a
note
of
two
hundred
thousand
florins
authorizing
me
to
draw
upon
him
till
the
whole
sum
was
exhausted
just
as
i
was
going
esther
gave
me
fifty
shirts
and
fifty
handkerchiefs
of
the
finest
quality
it
was
not
my
love
for
manon
baletti
but
a
foolish
vanity
and
a
desire
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
luxurious
city
of
paris
which
made
me
leave
holland
but
such
was
the
disposition
that
mother
nature
had
given
me
that
fifteen
months
under
the
leads
had
not
been
enough
to
cure
this
mental
malady
of
mine
but
when
i
reflect
upon
after
events
of
my
life
i
am
not
astonished
that
the
leads
proved
ineffectual
for
the
numberless
vicissitudes
which
i
have
gone
through
since
have
not
cured
me
my
disorder
indeed
being
of
the
incurable
kind
there
is
no
such
thing
as
destiny
we
ourselves
shape
our
lives
notwithstanding
that
saying
of
the
stoics
ducit
nolentem
trahit
after
promising
esther
to
return
before
the
end
of
the
year
i
set
out
with
a
clerk
of
the
company
who
had
brought
the
french
securities
and
i
reached
the
hague
where
boaz
received
me
with
a
mingled
air
of
wonder
and
admiration
he
told
me
that
i
had
worked
a
miracle
but
he
added
to
succeed
thus
you
must
have
persuaded
them
that
peace
was
on
the
point
of
being
concluded
by
no
means
i
answered
so
far
from
my
persuading
them
they
are
of
the
opposite
opinion
but
all
the
same
i
may
tell
you
that
peace
is
really
imminent
if
you
like
to
give
me
that
assurance
in
writing
said
he
i
will
make
you
a
present
of
fifty
thousand
florins
worth
of
diamonds
well
i
answered
the
french
ambassador
is
of
the
same
opinion
as
myself
but
i
do
think
the
certainty
is
sufficiently
great
as
yet
for
you
to
risk
your
diamonds
upon
it
next
day
i
finished
my
business
with
the
ambassador
and
the
clerk
returned
to
amsterdam
i
went
to
supper
at
therese
and
found
her
children
very
well
dressed
i
told
her
to
go
on
to
rotterdam
the
next
day
and
wait
for
me
there
with
her
son
as
i
had
no
wish
to
give
scandal
at
the
hague
at
rotterdam
therese
told
me
that
she
knew
i
had
won
half
a
million
at
amsterdam
and
that
her
fortune
would
be
made
if
she
could
leave
holland
for
london
she
had
instructed
sophie
to
tell
me
that
my
good
luck
was
the
effect
of
the
prayers
she
had
addressed
to
heaven
on
my
behalf
i
saw
where
the
land
lay
and
i
enjoyed
a
good
laugh
at
the
mother
craft
and
the
child
piety
and
gave
her
a
hundred
ducats
telling
her
that
she
should
have
another
hundred
when
she
wrote
to
me
from
london
it
was
very
evident
that
she
thought
the
sum
a
very
moderate
one
but
i
would
not
give
her
any
more
she
waited
for
the
moment
when
i
was
getting
into
my
carriage
to
beg
me
to
give
her
another
hundred
ducats
and
i
said
in
a
low
tone
that
she
should
have
a
thousand
if
she
would
give
me
her
daughter
she
thought
it
over
for
a
minute
and
then
said
that
she
could
not
part
with
her
i
know
very
well
why
i
answered
and
drawing
a
watch
from
my
fob
i
gave
it
to
sophie
embraced
her
and
went
on
my
way
i
arrived
at
paris
on
february
and
took
sumptuous
apartments
near
the
rue
montorgueil
chapter
vi
i
meet
with
a
flattering
reception
from
my
patron
madame
infatuation
madame
and
her
family
madame
du
rumain
during
my
journey
from
the
hague
to
paris
short
as
it
was
i
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
seeing
that
the
mental
qualities
of
my
adopted
son
were
by
no
means
equal
to
his
physical
ones
as
i
had
said
the
chief
point
which
his
mother
had
impressed
on
him
was
reserve
which
she
had
instilled
into
him
out
of
regard
for
her
own
interests
my
readers
will
understand
what
i
mean
but
the
child
in
following
his
mother
instructions
had
gone
beyond
the
bounds
of
moderation
he
possessed
reserve
it
is
true
but
he
was
also
full
of
dissimulation
suspicion
and
hypocrisy
a
fine
trio
of
deceit
in
one
who
was
still
a
boy
he
not
only
concealed
what
he
knew
but
he
pretended
to
know
that
which
he
did
not
his
idea
of
the
one
quality
necessary
to
success
in
life
was
an
impenetrable
reserve
and
to
obtain
this
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
silence
the
dictates
of
his
heart
and
to
say
no
word
that
had
not
been
carefully
weighed
giving
other
people
wrong
impressions
passed
with
him
for
discretion
and
his
soul
being
incapable
of
a
generous
thought
he
seemed
likely
to
pass
through
life
without
knowing
what
friendship
meant
knowing
that
madame
counted
on
the
boy
for
the
accomplishment
of
her
absurd
hypostasis
and
that
the
more
mystery
i
made
of
his
birth
the
more
extravagant
would
be
her
fancies
about
it
i
told
the
lad
that
if
i
introduced
him
to
a
lady
who
questioned
him
by
himself
about
his
birth
he
was
to
be
perfectly
open
with
her
on
my
arrival
at
paris
my
first
visit
was
to
my
patron
whom
i
found
in
grand
company
amongst
whom
i
recognized
the
venetian
ambassador
who
pretended
not
to
know
me
how
long
have
you
been
in
paris
said
the
minister
taking
me
by
the
hand
i
have
only
just
stepped
out
of
my
chaise
then
go
to
versailles
you
will
find
the
duc
de
choiseul
and
the
there
you
have
been
wonderfully
successful
go
and
get
your
meed
of
praise
and
come
and
see
me
afterwards
tell
the
duke
that
voltaire
appointment
to
be
a
to
the
king
is
ready
i
was
not
going
to
start
for
versailles
at
midday
but
ministers
in
paris
are
always
talking
in
this
style
as
if
versailles
were
at
the
end
of
the
street
instead
of
going
there
i
went
to
see
madame
she
received
me
with
the
words
that
her
genius
had
informed
her
that
i
should
come
and
that
she
was
delighted
with
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
corneman
tells
me
that
you
have
been
doing
wonders
in
holland
but
i
see
more
in
the
matter
than
he
does
as
i
am
quite
certain
that
you
have
taken
over
the
twenty
millions
yourself
the
funds
have
risen
and
a
hundred
millions
at
least
will
be
in
circulation
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
you
must
not
be
offended
at
my
shabby
present
for
of
course
twelve
thousand
francs
are
nothing
to
you
you
must
look
upon
them
as
a
little
token
of
friendship
i
am
going
to
tell
my
servants
to
close
all
the
doors
for
i
am
too
glad
to
see
you
not
to
want
to
have
you
all
to
myself
a
profound
bow
was
the
only
reply
i
made
to
this
flattering
speech
and
i
saw
her
tremble
with
joy
when
i
told
her
that
i
had
brought
a
lad
of
twelve
with
me
whom
i
intended
to
place
in
the
best
school
i
could
find
that
he
might
have
a
good
education
i
will
send
him
myself
to
viar
where
my
nephews
are
what
is
his
name
where
is
he
i
know
well
what
this
boy
is
i
long
to
see
him
why
did
you
not
alight
from
your
journey
at
my
house
her
questions
and
replies
followed
one
another
in
rapid
succession
i
should
have
found
it
impossible
to
get
in
a
word
edgeways
even
if
i
had
wanted
to
but
i
was
very
glad
to
let
her
expend
her
enthusiasm
and
took
good
care
not
to
interrupt
her
on
the
first
opportunity
i
told
her
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
the
young
gentleman
to
her
the
day
after
tomorrow
as
on
the
morrow
i
had
an
engagement
at
versailles
does
the
dear
lad
speak
french
while
i
am
arranging
for
his
going
to
school
you
must
really
let
him
come
and
live
with
me
we
will
discuss
that
question
on
the
day
after
tomorrow
madam
oh
how
i
wish
the
day
after
was
here
on
leaving
madame
i
went
to
my
lottery
office
and
found
everything
in
perfect
order
i
then
went
to
the
italian
play
and
found
silvia
and
her
daughter
in
their
my
dear
friend
said
she
when
she
saw
me
i
know
that
you
have
achieved
a
wonderful
success
in
holland
and
i
congratulate
you
i
gave
her
an
agreeable
surprise
by
saying
that
i
had
been
working
for
her
daughter
and
marion
herself
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
in
a
very
suggestive
manner
i
will
be
with
you
at
supper
i
added
and
then
we
can
talk
at
our
ease
on
leaving
them
i
went
to
the
amphitheatre
and
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
in
one
of
the
first
boxes
madame
x
c
v
with
all
her
family
my
readers
will
be
glad
to
hear
their
history
madame
x
c
v
by
birth
a
greek
was
the
widow
of
an
englishman
by
whom
she
had
six
children
four
of
whom
were
girls
on
his
he
became
a
catholic
out
of
deference
to
the
tears
of
his
wife
but
as
his
children
could
not
inherit
his
forty
thousand
pounds
invested
in
england
without
conforming
to
the
church
of
england
the
family
returned
to
london
where
the
widow
complied
with
all
the
obligations
of
the
law
of
england
what
will
people
not
do
when
their
interests
are
at
stake
though
in
a
case
like
this
there
is
no
need
to
blame
a
person
for
yielding
to
prejudices
which
had
the
sanction
of
the
law
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
five
years
before
when
i
was
at
padua
i
fell
in
love
with
the
eldest
daughter
but
a
few
months
after
when
we
were
at
venice
madame
thought
good
to
exclude
me
from
her
family
circle
the
insult
which
the
mother
put
upon
me
was
softened
by
the
daughter
who
wrote
me
a
charming
letter
which
i
love
to
read
even
now
i
may
as
well
confess
that
my
grief
was
the
easier
to
bear
as
my
time
was
taken
up
by
my
fair
nun
m
m
and
my
dear
c
c
nevertheless
mdlle
though
only
fifteen
was
of
a
perfect
beauty
and
was
all
the
more
charming
in
that
to
her
physical
advantages
she
joined
those
of
a
cultured
mind
count
algarotti
the
king
of
prussia
chamberlain
gave
her
lessons
and
several
young
nobles
were
among
her
suitors
her
preference
apparently
being
given
to
the
heir
of
the
family
of
memmo
de
marcuola
he
died
a
year
afterwards
while
he
was
procurator
my
surprise
at
seeing
this
family
at
such
a
time
and
place
may
be
imagined
mdlle
saw
me
directly
and
pointed
me
out
to
her
mother
who
made
a
sign
to
me
with
her
fan
to
come
to
their
box
she
received
me
in
the
friendliest
manner
possible
telling
me
that
we
were
not
at
venice
now
and
that
she
hoped
i
would
often
come
and
see
them
at
the
hotel
de
bretagne
in
the
rue
andre
des
arts
i
told
them
that
i
did
not
wish
to
recall
any
events
which
might
have
happened
at
venice
and
her
daughter
having
joined
her
entreaties
to
those
of
her
mother
i
promised
to
accept
their
invitation
mdlle
struck
me
as
prettier
than
ever
and
my
love
after
sleeping
for
five
years
awoke
to
fresh
strength
and
vigour
they
told
me
that
they
were
going
to
pass
six
months
at
paris
before
returning
to
venice
in
return
i
informed
them
that
i
intended
making
paris
my
home
that
i
had
just
left
holland
that
i
was
going
to
versailles
the
next
day
so
that
i
could
not
pay
my
respects
to
them
till
the
day
after
i
also
begged
them
to
accept
my
services
in
a
manner
which
let
them
know
i
was
a
person
of
some
importance
mdlle
said
that
she
was
aware
that
the
results
of
my
dutch
mission
should
render
me
dear
to
france
that
she
had
always
lived
in
hopes
of
seeing
me
once
more
that
my
famous
flight
from
the
leads
had
delighted
them
for
she
added
we
have
always
been
fond
of
you
i
fancy
your
mother
has
kept
her
fondness
for
me
very
much
to
herself
i
whispered
to
her
we
wo
say
anything
about
that
said
she
in
the
same
tone
we
learnt
all
the
circumstances
of
your
wonderful
flight
from
a
letter
of
sixteen
pages
you
wrote
to
memmo
we
trembled
with
joy
and
shuddered
with
fear
as
we
read
it
how
did
you
know
i
have
been
in
holland
de
la
popeliniere
told
us
about
it
yesterday
de
la
popeliniere
the
whom
i
had
known
seven
years
ago
at
passi
came
into
the
box
just
as
his
name
was
spoken
after
complimenting
me
he
said
that
if
i
could
carry
through
the
same
operation
for
the
india
company
my
fortune
would
be
made
my
advice
to
you
is
he
said
to
get
yourself
naturalized
before
it
becomes
generally
known
that
you
have
made
half
a
million
of
money
half
a
million
i
only
wish
i
had
you
must
have
made
that
at
the
lowest
calculation
on
the
contrary
i
give
you
my
assurance
that
if
my
claim
for
brokerage
is
not
allowed
the
transaction
will
prove
absolutely
ruinous
to
me
ah
no
doubt
you
are
right
to
take
that
tone
meanwhile
everyone
wants
to
make
your
acquaintance
for
france
is
deeply
indebted
to
you
you
have
caused
the
funds
to
recover
in
a
very
marked
degree
after
the
play
was
over
i
went
to
silvia
where
i
was
received
as
if
i
had
been
the
favourite
child
of
the
family
but
on
the
other
hand
i
gave
them
certain
proofs
that
i
wished
to
be
regarded
in
that
light
i
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
to
their
unshaken
friendship
i
owed
all
my
good
luck
and
i
made
the
father
mother
the
daughter
and
the
two
sons
receive
the
presents
i
had
got
for
them
the
best
was
for
the
mother
who
handed
it
on
to
her
daughter
it
was
a
pair
of
diamond
of
great
beauty
for
which
i
had
given
fifteen
thousand
francs
three
days
after
i
sent
her
a
box
containing
fine
linen
from
holland
and
choice
mechlin
and
alencon
lace
mario
who
liked
smoking
got
a
gold
pipe
the
father
a
choice
gold
and
enamelled
and
i
gave
a
repeater
to
the
younger
son
of
whom
i
was
very
fond
i
shall
have
occasion
later
on
to
speak
of
this
lad
whose
natural
qualities
were
far
superior
to
his
position
in
life
but
you
will
ask
was
i
rich
enough
to
make
such
presents
no
i
was
not
and
i
knew
it
perfectly
well
but
i
gave
these
presents
because
i
was
afraid
of
not
being
able
to
do
so
if
i
waited
i
set
out
for
versailles
at
and
de
choiseul
received
me
as
before
his
hair
was
being
dressed
but
for
a
moment
he
laid
down
his
pen
which
shewed
that
i
had
become
a
person
of
greater
importance
in
his
eyes
after
a
slight
but
grateful
compliment
he
told
me
that
if
i
thought
myself
capable
of
negotiating
a
loan
of
a
hundred
millions
to
bear
interest
at
four
per
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
help
me
my
answer
was
that
i
would
think
it
over
when
i
heard
how
much
i
was
to
have
for
what
i
had
done
already
but
everybody
says
that
you
have
made
two
hundred
thousand
florins
by
it
that
would
not
be
so
bad
half
a
million
of
francs
would
be
a
fair
foundation
on
which
to
build
a
fortune
but
i
can
assure
your
excellence
that
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
report
i
defy
anyone
to
prove
it
and
till
some
substantial
proof
is
offered
i
think
i
can
lay
claim
to
brokerage
true
true
go
to
the
and
state
your
views
to
him
de
boulogne
stopped
the
occupation
on
which
he
was
engaged
to
give
me
a
most
friendly
greeting
but
when
i
said
that
he
owed
me
a
hundred
thousand
florins
he
smiled
sardonically
i
happen
to
know
he
said
that
you
have
bills
of
exchange
to
the
amount
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
payable
to
yourself
certainly
but
that
money
has
no
connection
with
my
mission
as
i
can
prove
to
you
by
referring
you
to
i
have
in
my
head
an
infallible
project
for
increasing
the
revenue
by
twenty
millions
in
a
manner
which
will
cause
no
irritation
you
do
say
so
communicate
your
plan
and
i
promise
to
get
you
a
pension
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
letters
of
nobility
as
well
if
you
like
to
become
a
frenchman
i
will
think
it
over
on
leaving
de
boulogne
i
went
to
the
palace
where
a
ballet
was
going
on
before
the
marquise
de
pompadour
she
bowed
to
me
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
and
on
my
approaching
her
she
told
me
that
i
was
an
able
financier
and
that
the
gentlemen
below
could
not
appreciate
my
merits
she
had
not
forgotten
what
i
had
said
to
her
eight
years
before
in
the
theatre
at
fontainebleau
i
replied
that
all
good
gifts
were
from
above
whither
with
her
help
i
hoped
to
attain
on
my
return
to
paris
i
went
to
the
hotel
bourbon
to
inform
my
patron
of
the
result
of
my
journey
his
advice
to
me
was
to
continue
to
serve
the
government
well
as
its
good
fortune
would
come
to
be
mine
on
my
telling
him
of
my
meeting
with
the
he
said
that
de
la
popeliniere
was
going
to
marry
the
elder
daughter
when
i
got
to
my
house
my
son
was
nowhere
to
be
found
my
landlady
told
me
that
a
great
lady
had
come
to
call
on
my
lord
and
that
she
had
taken
him
away
with
her
guessing
that
this
was
madame
i
went
to
bed
without
troubling
myself
any
further
early
next
morning
my
clerk
brought
me
a
letter
it
came
from
the
old
attorney
uncle
to
gaetan
wife
whom
i
had
helped
to
escape
from
the
jealous
fury
of
her
brutal
husband
the
attorney
begged
me
to
come
and
speak
to
him
at
the
courts
or
to
make
an
appointment
at
some
place
where
he
could
see
me
i
went
to
the
courts
and
found
him
there
my
niece
he
began
found
herself
obliged
to
go
into
a
convent
and
from
this
vantage
ground
she
is
pleading
against
her
husband
with
the
aid
of
a
barrister
who
will
be
responsible
for
the
costs
however
to
win
our
case
we
require
the
evidence
of
yourself
count
tiretta
and
other
servants
who
witnessed
the
scene
at
the
inn
i
did
all
i
could
and
four
months
afterwards
gaetan
simplified
matters
by
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
which
obliged
him
to
leave
france
in
due
time
and
place
i
shall
have
something
more
to
say
about
him
as
for
his
wife
who
was
young
and
pretty
she
paid
her
counsel
in
love
money
and
was
very
happy
with
him
and
may
be
happy
still
for
all
i
know
but
i
have
entirely
lost
sight
of
her
after
my
interview
with
the
old
attorney
i
went
to
madame
to
see
tiretta
who
was
out
madame
was
still
in
love
with
him
and
he
continued
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
i
left
my
address
and
went
to
the
hotel
de
bretagne
to
pay
my
first
call
on
madame
the
lady
though
she
was
not
over
fond
of
me
received
me
with
great
politeness
i
possibly
cut
a
better
figure
in
her
eyes
when
rich
and
at
paris
then
when
we
were
in
venice
we
all
know
that
diamonds
have
the
strange
power
of
fascination
and
that
they
form
an
excellent
substitute
for
virtue
madame
had
with
her
an
old
greek
named
zandiri
brother
to
de
bragadin
who
was
just
dead
i
uttered
some
expressions
of
sympathy
and
the
boor
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
answer
me
but
i
was
avenged
for
his
foolish
stiffness
by
the
enthusiasm
with
which
i
was
welcomed
by
everyone
else
the
eldest
girl
her
sisters
and
the
two
sons
almost
overwhelmed
me
with
friendliness
the
eldest
son
was
only
fourteen
and
was
a
young
fellow
of
charming
manners
but
evidently
extremely
independent
and
sighed
for
the
time
when
he
would
be
able
to
devote
himself
to
a
career
of
profligacy
for
which
he
was
well
fitted
mdlle
was
both
beautiful
and
charming
in
her
manner
and
had
received
an
excellent
education
of
which
however
she
made
no
parade
one
could
not
stay
in
her
presence
without
loving
her
but
she
was
no
flirt
and
i
soon
saw
that
she
held
out
no
vain
hopes
to
those
who
had
the
misfortune
not
to
please
her
without
being
rude
she
knew
how
to
be
cold
and
it
was
all
the
worse
for
those
whom
her
coldness
did
not
shew
that
their
quest
was
useless
the
first
hour
i
passed
in
her
company
chained
me
a
captive
to
her
triumphant
car
i
told
her
as
much
and
she
replied
that
she
was
glad
to
have
such
a
captive
she
took
the
place
in
my
heart
where
esther
had
reigned
a
week
before
but
i
freely
confess
that
esther
yielded
only
because
she
was
away
as
to
my
attachment
to
sylvia
daughter
it
was
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
hinder
me
falling
in
love
with
any
other
woman
who
chanced
to
take
my
fancy
in
the
libertine
heart
love
can
not
exist
without
substantial
food
and
women
who
have
had
some
experience
of
the
world
are
well
aware
of
this
fact
the
youthful
baletti
was
a
beginner
and
so
knew
nothing
of
these
things
farsetti
a
venetian
of
noble
birth
a
knight
of
malta
a
great
student
of
the
occult
sciences
and
a
good
latin
versifier
came
in
at
one
dinner
was
just
ready
and
madame
begged
him
to
stay
she
asked
me
also
to
dine
with
them
but
wishing
to
dine
with
madame
i
refused
the
invitation
for
the
nonce
farsetti
who
had
known
me
very
well
at
venice
only
noticed
me
by
a
and
without
shewing
any
vexation
i
paid
him
back
in
the
same
coin
he
smiled
at
mdlle
praise
of
my
courage
she
noticed
his
expression
and
as
if
to
punish
him
for
it
went
on
to
say
that
i
had
now
the
admiration
of
every
venetian
and
that
the
french
were
anxious
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
me
a
farsetti
asked
me
if
my
post
at
the
lottery
paid
well
i
replied
coolly
oh
yes
well
enough
for
me
to
pay
my
clerks
salaries
he
understood
the
drift
of
my
reply
and
mdlle
smiled
i
found
my
supposed
son
with
madame
or
rather
in
that
amiable
visionary
arms
she
hastened
to
apologize
for
carrying
him
off
and
i
turned
it
off
with
a
jest
having
no
other
course
to
take
i
made
him
sleep
with
me
she
said
but
i
shall
be
obliged
to
deprive
myself
of
this
privilege
for
the
future
unless
he
promises
to
be
more
discreet
i
thought
the
idea
a
grand
one
and
the
little
fellow
in
spite
of
his
blushes
begged
her
to
say
how
he
had
offended
we
shall
have
the
comte
de
germain
said
madame
to
dinner
i
know
he
amuses
you
and
i
like
you
to
enjoy
yourself
in
my
house
for
that
madam
your
presence
is
all
i
need
nevertheless
i
thank
you
for
considering
me
in
due
course
germain
arrived
and
in
his
usual
manner
sat
himself
down
not
to
eat
but
to
talk
with
a
face
of
imperturbable
gravity
he
told
the
most
incredible
stories
which
one
had
to
pretend
to
believe
as
he
was
always
either
the
hero
of
the
tale
or
an
eye
witness
of
the
event
all
the
same
i
could
not
help
bursting
into
laughter
when
he
told
us
of
something
that
happened
as
he
was
dining
with
the
fathers
of
the
council
of
trent
madame
wore
on
her
neck
a
large
magnet
she
said
that
it
would
one
day
happen
that
this
magnet
would
attract
the
lightning
and
that
she
would
consequently
soar
into
the
sun
i
longed
to
tell
her
that
when
she
got
there
she
could
be
no
higher
up
than
on
the
earth
but
i
restrained
myself
and
the
great
charlatan
hastened
to
say
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
and
that
he
and
he
only
could
increase
the
force
of
the
magnet
a
thousand
times
i
said
dryly
that
i
would
wager
twenty
thousand
crowns
he
would
not
so
much
as
double
its
force
but
madame
would
not
let
us
bet
and
after
dinner
she
told
me
in
private
that
i
should
have
lost
as
germain
was
a
magician
of
course
i
agreed
with
her
a
few
days
later
the
magician
set
out
for
chambord
where
the
king
had
given
him
a
suite
of
rooms
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
that
he
might
be
at
liberty
to
work
on
the
dyes
which
were
to
assure
the
superiority
of
french
materials
over
those
of
any
other
country
germain
had
got
over
the
king
by
arranging
a
laboratory
where
he
occasionally
tried
to
amuse
himself
though
he
knew
little
about
chemistry
but
the
king
was
the
victim
of
an
almost
universal
weariness
to
enjoy
a
harem
recruited
from
amongst
the
most
ravishing
beauties
and
often
from
the
ranks
of
neophytes
with
whom
pleasure
had
its
difficulties
one
would
have
needed
to
be
a
god
and
louis
xv
was
only
a
man
after
all
it
was
the
famous
marquise
who
had
introduced
the
adept
to
the
king
in
the
hope
of
his
distracting
the
monarch
weariness
by
giving
him
a
taste
for
chemistry
indeed
madame
de
pompadour
was
under
the
impression
that
germain
had
given
her
the
water
of
perpetual
youth
and
therefore
felt
obliged
to
make
the
chemist
a
good
return
this
wondrous
water
taken
according
to
the
charlatan
directions
could
not
indeed
make
old
age
retire
and
give
way
to
youth
but
according
to
the
marquise
it
would
preserve
one
in
statu
quo
for
several
centuries
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
water
or
the
giver
of
it
had
worked
wonders
if
not
on
her
body
at
least
on
her
mind
she
assured
the
king
that
she
was
not
getting
older
the
king
was
as
much
deluded
by
this
grand
impostor
as
she
was
for
one
day
he
shewed
the
duc
des
a
diamond
of
the
first
water
weighing
twelve
carats
which
he
fancied
he
had
made
himself
i
melted
down
said
louis
small
diamonds
weighing
carats
and
obtained
this
one
large
one
weighing
twelve
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
infatuated
monarch
gave
the
impostor
the
suite
formerly
occupied
by
marshal
saxe
the
duc
des
told
me
this
story
with
his
own
lips
one
evening
when
i
was
supping
with
him
and
a
swede
the
comte
de
levenhoop
at
metz
before
i
left
madame
i
told
her
that
the
lad
might
be
he
who
should
make
her
to
be
born
again
but
that
she
would
spoil
all
if
she
did
not
wait
for
him
to
attain
the
age
of
puberty
after
what
she
had
said
about
his
misbehavior
the
reader
will
guess
what
made
me
say
this
she
sent
him
to
board
with
viar
gave
him
masters
on
everything
and
disguised
him
under
the
name
of
the
comte
although
he
was
born
at
bayreuth
and
though
his
mother
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
spaniard
of
that
name
it
was
three
or
four
months
before
i
went
to
see
him
as
i
was
afraid
of
being
insulted
on
account
of
the
name
which
the
visionary
madame
had
given
him
one
day
tiretta
came
to
see
me
in
a
fine
coach
he
told
me
that
his
elderly
mistress
wanted
to
become
his
wife
but
that
he
would
not
hear
of
it
though
she
offered
to
endow
him
with
all
her
worldly
goods
i
told
him
that
if
he
gave
in
he
might
pay
his
debts
return
to
trevisa
and
live
pleasantly
there
but
his
destiny
would
not
allow
him
to
take
my
advice
i
had
resolved
on
taking
a
country
house
and
fixed
on
one
called
little
poland
which
pleased
me
better
than
all
the
others
i
had
seen
it
was
well
furnished
and
was
a
hundred
paces
distant
from
the
madeleine
gate
it
was
situated
on
slightly
elevated
ground
near
the
royal
park
behind
the
duc
de
grammont
garden
and
its
owner
had
given
it
the
name
of
pleasant
warsaw
it
had
two
gardens
one
of
which
was
on
a
level
with
the
first
floor
three
reception
rooms
large
stables
coach
houses
baths
a
good
cellar
and
a
splendid
kitchen
the
master
was
called
the
butter
king
and
always
wrote
himself
down
so
the
name
had
been
given
to
him
by
louis
xv
on
the
monarch
stopping
at
the
house
and
liking
the
butter
the
butter
king
let
me
his
house
for
a
hundred
louis
per
annum
and
he
gave
me
an
excellent
cook
called
the
pearl
a
true
of
the
order
of
cooks
and
to
her
he
gave
charge
of
all
his
furniture
and
the
plate
i
should
want
for
a
dinner
of
six
persons
engaging
to
get
me
as
much
plate
as
i
wanted
at
the
hire
of
a
sous
an
ounce
he
also
promised
to
let
me
have
what
wine
i
wanted
and
said
all
he
had
was
of
the
best
and
moreover
cheaper
than
i
could
get
it
at
paris
as
he
had
no
to
pay
on
it
matters
having
been
arranged
on
these
terms
in
the
course
of
a
week
i
got
a
good
coachman
two
fine
carriages
five
horses
a
groom
and
two
footmen
madame
who
was
my
first
guest
was
delighted
with
my
new
abode
and
as
she
imagined
that
i
had
done
it
all
for
her
i
left
her
in
that
flattering
opinion
i
never
could
believe
in
the
morality
of
snatching
from
poor
mortal
man
the
delusions
which
make
them
happy
i
also
let
her
retain
the
notion
that
young
the
count
of
her
own
making
was
a
scion
of
the
nobility
that
he
was
born
for
a
mysterious
operation
unknown
to
the
rest
of
mankind
that
i
was
only
his
caretaker
here
i
spoke
the
truth
and
that
he
must
die
and
yet
not
cease
to
live
all
these
whimsical
ideas
were
the
products
of
her
brain
which
was
only
occupied
with
the
impossible
and
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
agree
with
everything
if
i
had
tried
to
undeceive
her
she
would
have
accused
me
of
want
of
trust
in
her
for
she
was
convinced
that
all
her
knowledge
was
revealed
to
her
by
her
genius
who
spoke
to
her
only
by
night
after
she
had
dined
with
me
i
took
her
back
to
her
house
full
of
happiness
camille
sent
me
a
lottery
ticket
which
she
had
invested
in
at
my
office
and
which
proved
to
be
a
winning
one
i
think
for
a
thousand
crowns
or
thereabouts
she
asked
me
to
come
and
sup
with
her
and
bring
the
money
with
me
i
accepted
her
invitation
and
found
her
surrounded
by
all
the
girls
she
knew
and
their
lovers
after
supper
i
was
asked
to
go
to
the
opera
with
them
but
we
had
scarcely
got
there
when
i
lost
my
party
in
the
crowd
i
had
no
mask
on
and
i
soon
found
myself
attacked
by
a
black
domino
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
woman
and
as
she
told
me
a
hundred
truths
about
myself
in
a
falsetto
voice
i
was
interested
and
determined
on
finding
out
who
she
was
at
last
i
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
come
with
me
into
a
box
and
as
soon
as
we
were
in
and
i
had
taken
off
her
mask
i
was
astonished
to
find
she
was
mdlle
i
have
come
to
the
ball
said
she
with
one
of
my
sisters
my
elder
brother
and
farsetti
i
left
them
to
go
into
a
box
and
change
my
domino
they
must
feel
very
uneasy
i
dare
say
they
do
but
i
am
not
going
to
take
pity
on
them
till
the
end
of
the
ball
finding
myself
alone
with
her
and
certain
of
having
her
in
my
company
for
the
rest
of
the
night
i
began
to
talk
of
our
old
and
i
took
care
to
say
that
i
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
ever
she
listened
to
me
kindly
did
not
oppose
my
embraces
and
by
the
few
obstacles
she
placed
in
my
way
i
judged
that
the
happy
moment
was
not
far
off
nevertheless
i
felt
that
i
must
practice
restraint
that
evening
and
she
let
me
see
that
she
was
obliged
to
me
i
heard
at
versailles
my
dear
mademoiselle
that
you
are
going
to
marry
de
la
popeliniere
so
they
say
my
mother
wishes
me
to
do
so
and
the
old
financier
fancies
he
has
got
me
in
his
talons
already
but
he
makes
a
mistake
as
i
will
never
consent
to
such
a
thing
he
is
old
but
he
is
very
rich
he
is
very
rich
and
very
generous
for
he
promises
me
a
dowry
of
a
million
if
i
become
a
widow
without
children
and
if
i
had
a
son
he
would
leave
me
all
his
property
you
would
have
much
difficulty
in
complying
with
the
second
alternative
i
shall
never
have
anything
to
do
with
his
money
for
i
should
never
make
my
life
miserable
by
a
marriage
with
a
man
whom
i
do
not
love
while
i
do
love
another
another
who
is
the
fortunate
mortal
to
whom
you
have
given
your
treasure
i
do
not
know
if
my
loved
one
is
fortunate
my
lover
is
a
venetian
and
my
mother
knows
of
it
but
she
says
that
i
should
not
be
happy
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
me
your
mother
is
a
strange
woman
always
crossing
your
affections
i
can
not
be
angry
with
her
she
may
possibly
be
wrong
but
she
certainly
loves
me
she
would
rather
that
i
should
marry
farsetti
who
would
be
very
glad
to
have
me
but
i
detest
him
has
he
made
a
declaration
in
terms
he
has
and
all
the
marks
of
contempt
i
have
given
him
seem
to
have
no
effect
he
clings
hard
to
hope
but
the
truth
is
you
have
fascinated
him
possibly
but
i
do
not
think
him
susceptible
of
any
tender
or
generous
feeling
he
is
a
visionary
surly
jealous
and
envious
in
his
disposition
when
he
heard
me
expressing
myself
about
you
in
the
manner
you
deserve
he
had
the
impudence
to
say
to
my
mother
before
my
face
that
she
ought
not
to
receive
you
he
deserves
that
i
should
give
him
a
lesson
in
manners
but
there
are
other
ways
in
which
he
may
be
punished
i
shall
be
delighted
to
serve
you
in
any
way
i
can
alas
if
i
could
only
count
on
your
friendship
i
should
be
happy
the
sigh
with
which
she
uttered
these
words
sent
fire
through
my
veins
and
i
told
her
that
i
was
her
devoted
slave
that
i
had
fifty
thousand
crowns
which
were
at
her
service
and
that
i
would
risk
my
life
to
win
her
favours
she
replied
that
she
was
truly
grateful
to
me
and
as
she
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
our
lips
met
but
i
saw
that
she
was
weeping
so
i
took
care
that
the
fire
which
her
kisses
raised
should
be
kept
within
bounds
she
begged
me
to
come
and
see
her
often
promising
that
as
often
as
she
could
manage
it
we
should
be
alone
i
could
ask
no
more
and
after
i
had
promised
to
come
and
dine
with
them
on
the
morrow
we
parted
i
passed
an
hour
in
walking
behind
her
enjoying
my
new
position
of
intimate
friend
and
i
then
returned
to
my
little
poland
it
was
a
short
distance
for
though
i
lived
in
the
country
i
could
get
to
any
part
of
paris
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
had
a
clever
coachman
and
capital
horses
not
used
to
being
spared
i
got
them
from
the
royal
stables
and
as
soon
as
i
lost
one
i
got
another
from
the
same
place
having
to
pay
two
hundred
francs
this
happened
to
me
several
times
for
to
my
mind
going
fast
is
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
which
paris
offers
having
accepted
an
invitation
to
dinner
at
the
i
did
not
give
myself
much
time
for
sleep
and
i
went
out
on
foot
with
a
cloak
on
the
snow
was
falling
in
large
flakes
and
when
i
got
to
madame
i
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
from
head
to
foot
she
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
laughing
and
saying
that
her
daughter
had
been
telling
her
how
she
had
puzzled
me
and
that
she
was
delighted
to
see
me
come
to
dinner
without
ceremony
but
added
she
it
friday
today
and
you
will
have
to
fast
though
after
all
the
fish
is
very
good
dinner
is
not
ready
yet
you
had
better
go
and
see
my
daughter
who
is
still
as
may
be
imagined
this
invitation
had
not
to
be
repeated
for
a
pretty
woman
looks
better
in
bed
than
anywhere
else
i
found
mdlle
sitting
up
in
bed
writing
but
she
stopped
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
how
is
this
sweet
not
up
yet
yes
i
am
staying
in
bed
partly
because
i
feel
lazy
and
partly
because
i
am
freer
here
i
was
afraid
you
were
not
quite
well
nor
am
i
however
we
will
say
no
more
about
that
now
i
am
just
going
to
take
some
soup
as
those
who
foolishly
establish
the
institution
of
fasting
were
not
polite
enough
to
ask
my
opinion
on
the
subject
it
does
not
agree
with
my
health
and
i
do
like
it
so
i
am
not
going
to
get
up
even
to
sit
at
table
though
i
shall
thus
deprive
myself
of
your
society
i
naturally
told
her
that
in
her
absence
dinner
would
have
no
savour
and
i
spoke
the
truth
as
the
presence
of
her
sister
did
not
disturb
us
she
took
out
of
her
an
epistle
in
verse
which
i
had
addressed
to
her
when
her
mother
had
forbidden
me
the
house
this
fatal
letter
said
she
which
you
called
phoenix
has
shaped
my
life
and
may
prove
the
cause
of
my
death
i
had
called
it
the
phoenix
because
after
bewailing
my
unhappy
lot
i
proceeded
to
predict
how
she
would
afterwards
give
her
heart
to
a
mortal
whose
qualities
would
make
him
deserve
the
name
of
phoenix
a
hundred
lines
were
taken
up
in
the
description
of
these
imaginary
mental
and
moral
characteristics
and
certainly
the
being
who
should
have
them
all
would
be
right
worthy
of
worship
for
he
would
be
rather
a
god
than
a
man
alas
said
mdlle
i
fell
in
love
with
this
imaginary
being
and
feeling
certain
that
such
an
one
must
exist
i
set
myself
to
look
for
him
after
six
months
i
thought
i
had
found
him
i
gave
him
my
heart
i
received
his
we
loved
each
other
fondly
but
for
the
last
four
months
we
have
been
separated
and
during
the
whole
time
i
have
only
had
one
letter
from
him
yet
i
must
not
blame
him
for
i
know
he
can
not
help
it
such
is
my
sorry
fate
i
can
neither
hear
from
him
nor
write
to
him
this
story
was
a
confirmation
of
a
theory
of
mine
namely
that
the
most
important
events
in
our
lives
proceed
often
from
the
most
trifling
causes
my
epistle
was
nothing
better
than
a
number
of
lines
of
poetry
more
or
less
well
written
and
the
being
i
had
delineated
was
certainly
not
to
be
found
as
he
surpassed
by
far
all
human
perfections
but
a
woman
heart
travels
so
quickly
and
so
far
mdlle
took
the
thing
literally
and
fell
in
love
with
a
chimera
of
goodness
and
then
was
fain
to
turn
this
into
a
real
lover
not
thinking
of
the
vast
difference
between
the
ideal
and
the
real
for
all
that
when
she
thought
that
she
had
found
the
original
of
my
fancy
portrait
she
had
no
difficulty
in
endowing
him
with
all
the
good
qualities
i
had
pictured
of
course
mdlle
would
have
fallen
in
love
if
i
had
never
written
her
a
letter
in
verse
but
she
would
have
done
so
in
a
different
manner
and
probably
with
different
results
as
soon
as
dinner
was
served
we
were
summoned
to
do
justice
to
the
choice
fish
which
de
la
popeliniere
had
provided
madame
a
narrowminded
greek
was
naturally
bigoted
and
superstitious
in
the
mind
of
a
silly
woman
the
idea
of
an
alliance
between
the
most
opposite
of
beings
god
and
the
devil
seems
quite
natural
a
priest
had
told
her
that
since
she
had
converted
her
husband
her
salvation
was
secure
for
the
scriptures
solemnly
promised
a
soul
for
a
soul
to
every
one
who
would
lead
a
heretic
or
a
heathen
within
the
fold
of
the
church
and
as
madame
had
converted
her
husband
she
felt
no
anxiety
about
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
as
she
had
done
all
that
was
necessary
however
she
ate
fish
on
the
days
appointed
the
reason
being
that
she
preferred
it
to
flesh
dinner
over
i
returned
to
the
lady
bedside
and
there
stayed
till
nearly
nine
keeping
my
passions
well
under
control
all
the
time
i
was
foppish
enough
to
think
that
her
feelings
were
as
lively
as
mine
and
i
did
not
care
to
shew
myself
less
than
she
though
i
knew
then
as
i
know
now
that
this
was
a
false
line
of
argument
it
is
the
same
with
opportunity
as
with
fortune
one
must
seize
them
when
they
come
to
us
or
else
they
go
by
often
to
return
no
more
not
seeing
farsetti
at
the
table
i
suspected
there
had
been
a
quarrel
and
i
asked
my
sweetheart
about
it
but
she
told
me
i
was
mistaken
in
supposing
they
had
quarreled
with
him
and
that
the
reason
of
his
absence
was
that
he
would
never
leave
his
house
on
a
friday
the
deluded
man
had
had
his
horoscope
drawn
and
learning
by
it
that
he
would
be
assassinated
on
a
friday
he
resolved
always
to
shut
himself
up
on
that
day
he
was
laughed
at
but
persisted
in
the
same
course
till
he
died
four
years
ago
at
the
age
of
seventy
he
thought
to
prove
by
the
success
of
his
precautions
that
a
man
destiny
depends
on
his
discretion
and
on
the
precautions
he
takes
to
avoid
the
misfortunes
of
which
he
has
had
warning
the
line
of
argument
holds
good
in
all
cases
except
when
the
misfortunes
are
predicted
in
a
horoscope
for
either
the
ills
predicted
are
avoidable
in
which
case
the
horoscope
is
a
useless
piece
of
folly
or
else
the
horoscope
is
the
interpreter
of
destiny
in
which
case
all
the
precautions
in
the
world
are
of
no
avail
the
chevalier
farsetti
was
therefore
a
fool
to
imagine
he
had
proved
anything
at
all
he
would
have
proved
a
good
deal
for
many
people
if
he
had
gone
out
on
a
friday
and
had
chanced
to
have
been
assassinated
picas
de
la
mirandola
who
believed
in
astrology
says
i
have
no
doubt
truly
influunt
non
cogunt
but
would
it
have
been
a
real
proof
of
the
truth
of
astrology
if
farsetti
had
been
assassinated
on
a
friday
in
my
opinion
certainly
not
the
comte
had
introduced
me
to
his
sister
the
comtesse
du
remain
who
had
been
wanting
to
make
my
acquaintance
ever
since
she
had
heard
of
my
oracle
it
was
not
long
before
i
made
friends
with
her
husband
and
her
two
daughters
the
elder
of
whom
nicknamed
cotenfau
married
de
polignac
later
on
madame
du
remain
was
handsome
rather
than
pretty
but
she
won
the
love
of
all
by
her
kindness
her
frank
courtesy
and
her
eagerness
to
be
of
service
to
her
friends
she
had
a
magnificent
figure
and
would
have
awed
the
whole
bench
of
judges
if
she
had
pleaded
before
them
at
her
house
i
got
to
know
mesdames
de
valbelle
and
de
rancerolles
the
princess
de
chimai
and
many
others
who
were
then
in
the
best
society
of
paris
although
madame
du
remain
was
not
a
proficient
in
the
occult
sciences
she
had
nevertheless
consulted
my
oracle
more
frequently
than
madame
she
was
of
the
utmost
service
to
me
in
connection
with
an
unhappy
circumstance
of
which
i
shall
speak
presently
the
day
after
my
long
conversation
with
mdlle
my
servant
told
me
that
there
was
a
young
man
waiting
who
wanted
to
give
me
a
letter
with
his
own
hands
i
had
him
in
and
on
my
asking
him
from
whom
the
letter
came
he
replied
that
i
should
find
all
particulars
in
the
letter
and
that
he
had
orders
to
wait
for
an
answer
the
epistle
ran
as
follows
i
am
writing
this
at
two
in
the
morning
i
am
weary
and
in
need
of
rest
but
a
burden
on
my
soul
deprives
me
of
sleep
the
secret
i
am
about
to
tell
you
will
no
longer
be
so
grievous
when
i
have
confided
in
you
i
shall
feel
eased
by
placing
it
in
your
breast
i
am
with
child
and
my
situation
drives
me
to
despair
i
was
obliged
to
write
to
you
because
i
felt
i
could
not
say
it
give
me
a
word
in
reply
my
feelings
on
reading
the
above
may
be
guessed
i
was
petrified
with
astonishment
and
could
only
write
i
will
be
with
you
at
eleven
no
one
should
say
that
he
has
passed
through
great
misfortunes
unless
they
have
proved
too
great
for
his
mind
to
bear
the
confidence
of
mdlle
shewed
me
that
she
was
in
need
of
support
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
the
preference
and
i
vowed
to
do
my
best
for
her
did
it
cost
me
my
life
these
were
the
thoughts
of
a
lover
but
for
all
that
i
could
not
conceal
from
myself
the
imprudence
of
the
step
she
had
taken
in
such
cases
as
these
there
is
always
the
choice
between
speaking
or
writing
and
the
only
feeling
which
can
give
the
preference
to
writing
is
false
shame
at
bottom
mere
cowardice
if
i
had
not
been
in
love
with
her
i
should
have
found
it
easier
to
have
refused
my
aid
in
writing
than
if
she
had
spoken
to
me
but
i
loved
her
to
distraction
yes
said
i
to
myself
she
can
count
on
me
her
mishap
makes
her
all
the
dearer
to
me
and
below
this
there
was
another
voice
a
voice
which
whispered
to
me
that
if
i
succeeded
in
saving
her
my
reward
was
sure
i
am
well
aware
that
more
than
one
grave
moralist
will
fling
stones
at
me
for
this
avowal
but
my
answer
is
that
such
men
can
not
be
in
love
as
i
was
i
was
punctual
to
my
appointment
and
found
the
fair
unfortunate
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
you
are
going
out
are
you
where
are
you
going
i
am
going
to
mass
at
the
church
of
the
augustinians
is
this
a
saint
day
no
but
my
mother
makes
me
go
every
day
i
will
come
with
you
yes
do
give
me
your
arm
we
will
go
into
the
cloisters
and
talk
there
mdlle
was
accompanied
by
her
maid
but
she
knew
better
than
to
be
in
the
way
so
we
left
her
in
the
cloisters
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
she
said
to
me
have
you
read
my
letter
yes
of
course
here
it
is
burn
it
yourself
no
keep
it
and
do
so
with
your
own
hands
i
see
you
trust
in
me
and
i
assure
you
i
will
not
abuse
your
trust
i
am
sure
you
will
not
i
am
four
months
with
child
i
can
doubt
it
no
longer
and
the
thought
maddens
me
comfort
yourself
we
will
find
some
way
to
get
over
it
yes
i
leave
all
to
you
you
must
procure
an
abortion
never
dearest
that
is
a
crime
alas
i
know
that
well
but
it
is
not
a
greater
crime
than
suicide
and
there
lies
my
choice
either
to
destroy
the
wretched
witness
of
my
shame
or
to
poison
myself
for
the
latter
alternative
i
have
everything
ready
you
are
my
only
friend
and
it
is
for
you
to
decide
which
it
shall
be
speak
to
me
are
you
angry
that
i
have
not
gone
to
the
chevalier
farsetti
before
you
she
saw
my
astonishment
and
stopped
short
and
tried
to
wipe
away
the
tears
which
escaped
from
her
eyes
my
heart
bled
for
her
laying
the
question
of
crime
on
one
side
said
i
abortion
is
out
of
our
power
if
the
means
employed
are
not
violent
they
are
uncertain
and
if
they
are
violent
they
are
dangerous
to
the
mother
i
will
never
risk
becoming
your
executioner
but
reckon
on
me
i
will
not
forsake
you
your
honour
is
as
dear
to
me
as
your
life
becalm
and
henceforth
think
that
the
peril
is
mine
not
yours
make
up
your
mind
that
i
shall
find
some
way
of
escape
and
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
cut
short
that
life
to
preserve
which
i
would
gladly
die
and
allow
me
to
say
that
when
i
read
your
note
i
felt
glad
i
could
not
help
it
that
at
such
an
emergency
you
chose
me
before
all
others
to
be
your
helper
you
will
find
that
your
trust
was
not
given
in
vain
for
no
one
loves
you
as
well
as
i
and
no
one
is
so
fain
to
help
you
later
you
shall
begin
to
take
the
remedies
i
will
get
for
you
but
i
warn
you
to
be
on
your
guard
for
this
is
a
serious
matter
one
of
life
and
death
possibly
you
have
already
told
somebody
about
it
your
maid
or
one
of
your
sisters
i
have
not
told
anybody
but
you
not
even
the
author
of
my
shame
i
tremble
when
i
think
what
my
mother
would
do
and
say
if
she
found
out
my
situation
i
am
afraid
she
will
draw
her
conclusions
from
my
shape
so
far
there
is
nothing
to
be
observed
in
that
direction
the
beauty
of
the
outline
still
remains
intact
but
every
day
increases
its
size
and
for
that
reason
we
must
be
quick
in
what
we
do
you
must
find
a
surgeon
who
does
not
know
my
name
and
take
me
to
him
to
be
bled
i
will
not
run
the
risk
it
might
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
whole
affair
i
will
bleed
you
myself
it
is
a
simple
operation
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
i
feel
as
if
you
had
already
brought
me
from
death
to
life
what
i
should
like
you
to
do
would
be
to
take
me
to
a
midwife
we
can
easily
go
without
attracting
any
notice
at
the
first
ball
at
the
opera
yes
sweetheart
but
that
step
is
not
necessary
and
it
might
lead
to
our
betrayal
no
no
in
this
great
town
there
are
midwives
in
every
quarter
and
we
should
never
be
known
we
might
keep
our
masks
on
all
the
time
do
me
this
kindness
a
midwife
opinion
is
certainly
worth
having
i
could
not
refuse
her
request
but
i
made
her
agree
to
wait
till
the
last
ball
as
the
crowd
was
always
greater
and
we
had
a
better
chance
of
going
out
free
from
observation
i
promised
to
be
there
in
a
black
domino
with
a
white
mask
in
the
venetian
fashion
and
a
rose
painted
beside
the
left
eye
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
go
out
she
was
to
follow
me
into
a
carriage
all
this
was
carried
out
but
more
of
it
anon
i
returned
with
her
and
dined
with
them
without
taking
any
notice
of
farsetti
who
was
also
at
the
table
and
had
seen
me
come
back
from
mass
with
her
we
did
not
speak
a
word
to
one
another
he
did
not
like
me
and
i
despised
him
i
must
here
relate
a
grievous
mistake
of
which
i
was
guilty
and
which
i
have
not
yet
forgiven
myself
i
had
promised
to
take
mdlle
to
a
midwife
but
i
certainly
ought
to
have
taken
her
to
a
respectable
woman
for
all
we
wanted
to
know
was
how
a
pregnant
woman
should
regulate
her
diet
and
manner
of
living
but
my
evil
genius
took
me
by
the
rue
louis
and
there
i
saw
the
montigni
entering
her
house
with
a
pretty
girl
whom
i
did
not
know
and
so
out
of
curiosity
i
went
in
after
them
after
amusing
myself
there
with
mdlle
running
in
my
head
all
the
time
i
asked
the
woman
to
give
me
the
address
of
a
midwife
as
i
wanted
to
consult
one
she
told
me
of
a
house
in
the
marais
where
according
to
her
dwelt
the
pearl
of
midwives
and
began
telling
me
some
stories
of
her
exploits
which
all
went
to
prove
that
the
woman
was
an
infamous
character
i
took
her
address
however
and
as
i
should
have
to
go
there
by
night
i
went
the
next
day
to
see
where
the
house
was
mdlle
began
to
take
the
remedies
which
i
brought
her
which
ought
to
have
weakened
and
destroyed
the
result
of
love
but
as
she
did
not
experience
any
benefit
she
was
impatient
to
consult
a
midwife
on
the
night
of
the
last
ball
she
recognized
me
as
we
had
agreed
and
followed
me
out
into
the
coach
she
saw
me
enter
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
reached
the
house
of
shame
a
woman
of
about
fifty
received
us
with
great
politeness
and
asked
what
she
could
do
mdlle
told
her
that
she
believed
herself
pregnant
and
that
she
desired
some
means
of
concealing
her
misfortune
the
wretch
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
might
as
well
tell
her
plainly
that
it
would
be
easy
to
procure
abortion
i
will
do
your
business
said
she
for
fifty
louis
half
to
be
paid
in
advance
on
account
of
drugs
and
the
rest
when
all
over
i
will
trust
in
your
honesty
and
you
will
have
to
trust
in
mine
give
me
the
louis
down
and
come
or
send
for
the
drugs
and
instructions
for
using
them
so
saying
she
turned
up
her
clothes
without
any
ceremony
and
as
i
at
mdlle
request
looked
away
she
felt
her
and
pronounced
as
she
let
down
her
dress
that
she
was
not
beyond
the
fourth
month
if
my
drugs
said
she
contrary
to
my
expectation
do
not
do
any
good
we
will
try
some
other
ways
and
in
any
case
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
obliging
you
i
will
return
you
your
money
i
do
doubt
it
for
a
moment
said
i
but
would
you
tell
me
what
are
those
other
ways
i
should
tell
the
lady
how
to
destroy
the
foetus
i
might
have
told
her
that
to
kill
the
child
meant
giving
a
mortal
wound
to
the
mother
but
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
enter
into
a
argument
with
this
vile
creature
if
madame
decides
on
taking
your
advice
said
i
i
will
bring
you
the
money
for
drugs
i
gave
her
two
louis
and
left
mdlle
told
me
that
she
had
no
doubt
of
the
infamy
of
this
woman
as
she
was
sure
it
was
impossible
to
destroy
the
offspring
without
the
risk
of
killing
the
mother
also
my
only
trust
said
she
is
in
you
i
encouraged
her
in
this
idea
dissuading
her
from
any
criminal
attempts
and
assured
her
over
and
over
again
that
she
should
not
find
her
trust
in
me
misplaced
all
at
once
she
complained
of
feeling
cold
and
asked
if
we
had
not
time
to
warm
ourselves
in
little
poland
saying
that
she
longed
to
see
my
pretty
house
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
with
the
idea
the
night
was
too
dark
for
her
to
see
the
exterior
charms
of
my
abode
she
would
have
to
satisfy
herself
with
the
inside
and
leave
the
rest
to
her
imagination
i
thought
my
hour
had
come
i
made
the
coach
stop
and
we
got
down
and
walked
some
way
and
then
took
another
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
ferannerie
i
promised
the
coachman
six
francs
beyond
his
fare
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
put
us
down
at
my
door
i
rang
with
the
touch
of
the
master
the
pearl
opened
the
door
and
told
me
that
there
was
nobody
within
as
i
very
well
knew
but
it
was
her
habit
to
do
so
quick
said
i
light
us
a
fire
and
bring
some
glasses
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
would
you
like
an
omelette
very
well
oh
i
should
like
an
omelette
so
much
said
mdlle
she
was
ravishing
and
her
laughing
air
seemed
to
promise
me
a
moment
of
bliss
i
sat
down
before
the
blazing
fire
and
made
her
sit
on
my
knee
covering
her
with
kisses
which
she
gave
me
back
as
lovingly
i
had
almost
won
what
i
wanted
when
she
asked
me
in
a
sweet
voice
to
stop
i
obeyed
thinking
it
would
please
her
feeling
sure
that
she
only
delayed
my
victory
to
make
it
more
complete
and
that
she
would
surrender
after
the
champagne
i
saw
love
kindness
trust
and
gratitude
shining
in
her
face
and
i
should
have
been
sorry
for
her
to
think
that
i
claimed
her
as
a
mere
reward
no
i
wanted
her
love
and
nothing
but
her
love
at
last
we
got
to
our
last
glass
of
champagne
we
rose
from
the
table
and
sentimentally
but
with
gentle
force
i
laid
her
on
a
couch
and
held
her
amorously
in
my
arms
but
instead
of
giving
herself
up
to
my
embraces
she
resisted
them
at
first
by
those
prayers
which
usually
make
lovers
more
enterprising
then
by
serious
remonstrances
and
at
last
by
force
this
was
too
much
the
mere
idea
of
using
violence
has
always
shocked
me
and
i
am
still
of
opinion
that
the
only
pleasure
in
the
amorous
embrace
springs
from
perfect
union
and
agreement
i
pleaded
my
cause
in
every
way
i
painted
myself
as
the
lover
flattered
deceived
despised
at
last
i
told
her
that
i
had
had
a
cruel
awakening
and
i
saw
that
the
shaft
went
home
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
begged
her
to
forgive
me
alas
said
she
in
a
voice
full
of
sadness
i
am
no
longer
mistress
of
my
heart
and
have
far
greater
cause
for
grief
than
you
the
tears
flowed
fast
down
her
cheeks
her
head
rested
on
my
shoulder
and
our
lips
met
but
for
all
that
the
piece
was
over
the
idea
of
renewing
the
attack
never
came
into
my
head
and
if
it
had
i
should
have
scornfully
rejected
it
after
a
long
silence
of
which
we
both
stood
in
need
she
to
conquer
her
shame
and
i
to
repress
my
anger
we
put
on
our
masks
and
returned
to
the
opera
on
our
way
she
dared
to
tell
me
that
she
should
be
obliged
to
decline
my
friendship
if
she
had
to
pay
for
it
so
dearly
the
emotions
of
love
i
replied
should
yield
to
those
of
honour
and
your
honour
as
well
as
mine
require
us
to
continue
friends
what
i
would
have
done
for
love
i
will
now
do
for
devoted
friendship
and
for
the
future
i
will
die
rather
than
make
another
attempt
to
gain
those
favours
of
which
i
thought
you
deemed
me
worthy
we
separated
at
the
opera
and
the
vast
crowd
made
me
lose
sight
of
her
in
an
instant
next
day
she
told
me
that
she
had
danced
all
night
she
possibly
hoped
to
find
in
that
exercise
the
cure
which
no
medicine
seemed
likely
to
give
her
i
returned
to
my
house
in
a
bad
humour
trying
in
vain
to
justify
a
refusal
which
seemed
humiliating
and
almost
incredible
my
good
sense
shewed
me
in
spite
of
all
sophisms
that
i
had
been
grievously
insulted
i
recollected
the
witty
saying
of
populia
who
was
never
unfaithful
to
her
husband
except
when
she
was
with
child
non
tollo
vectorem
said
she
nisi
navi
plena
i
felt
certain
that
i
was
not
loved
and
the
thought
grieved
me
and
i
considered
that
it
would
be
unworthy
of
me
to
love
one
whom
i
could
no
longer
hope
to
possess
i
resolved
to
avenge
myself
by
leaving
her
to
her
fate
feeling
that
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
be
duped
as
i
had
been
the
night
brought
wisdom
with
it
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
my
mind
was
calm
and
i
was
still
in
love
i
determined
to
act
generously
by
the
unfortunate
girl
without
my
aid
she
would
be
ruined
my
course
then
would
be
to
continue
my
services
and
to
shew
myself
indifferent
to
her
favours
the
part
was
no
easy
one
but
i
played
it
right
well
and
at
last
my
reward
came
of
itself
chapter
vii
i
continue
my
relations
with
mdlle
vain
attempts
to
procure
abortion
the
aroph
she
flies
from
home
and
takes
refuge
in
a
convent
the
difficulties
i
encountered
only
served
to
increase
my
love
for
my
charming
englishwoman
i
went
to
see
her
every
morning
and
as
my
interest
in
her
condition
was
genuine
she
could
have
no
suspicion
that
i
was
acting
a
part
or
attribute
my
care
of
her
to
anything
but
the
most
delicate
feelings
for
her
part
she
seemed
well
pleased
in
the
alteration
of
my
behaviour
though
her
satisfaction
may
very
probably
have
been
assumed
i
understood
women
well
enough
to
know
that
though
she
did
not
love
me
she
was
probably
annoyed
at
seeing
my
new
character
sit
upon
me
so
easily
one
morning
in
the
midst
of
an
unimportant
and
disconnected
conversation
she
complimented
me
upon
my
strength
of
mind
in
subduing
my
passion
adding
with
a
smile
that
my
desire
could
not
have
pricked
me
very
sharply
seeing
that
i
had
cured
myself
so
well
in
the
course
of
a
week
i
quietly
replied
that
i
owed
my
cure
not
to
the
weakness
of
my
passion
but
to
my
i
know
my
own
character
i
said
and
without
undue
presumption
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
am
worthy
of
a
woman
love
naturally
after
your
convincing
me
that
you
think
differently
i
feel
humiliated
and
indignant
do
you
know
what
effect
such
feelings
have
on
the
heart
alas
said
she
i
know
too
well
their
effect
is
to
inspire
one
with
contempt
for
her
who
gave
rise
to
them
that
is
going
too
far
at
least
in
my
case
my
indignation
was
merely
succeeded
by
a
renewed
confidence
in
myself
and
a
determination
to
be
revenged
to
be
revenged
in
what
way
i
wish
to
compel
you
to
esteem
me
by
proving
to
you
that
i
am
lord
of
myself
and
can
pass
by
with
indifference
what
i
once
so
ardently
desired
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
succeeded
yet
but
i
may
say
that
i
can
now
contemplate
your
charms
without
desiring
to
possess
them
you
are
making
a
mistake
for
i
never
ceased
to
esteem
you
and
i
esteemed
you
as
much
a
week
ago
as
i
do
nor
for
a
moment
i
did
think
you
capable
of
leaving
me
to
my
fate
as
a
punishment
for
having
refused
to
give
way
to
your
transports
and
i
am
glad
that
i
read
your
character
rightly
we
went
on
to
speak
of
the
opiate
i
made
her
take
and
as
she
saw
no
change
in
her
condition
she
wanted
me
to
increase
the
dose
a
request
i
took
care
not
to
grant
as
i
knew
that
more
than
half
a
drachm
might
kill
her
i
also
forbade
her
to
bleed
herself
again
as
she
might
do
herself
a
serious
injury
without
gaining
anything
by
it
her
maid
of
whom
she
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
confidante
had
had
her
bled
by
a
student
her
lover
i
told
mdlle
that
if
she
wanted
these
people
to
keep
her
counsel
she
must
be
liberal
with
them
and
she
replied
that
she
had
no
money
i
offered
her
money
and
she
accepted
fifty
louis
assuring
me
that
she
would
repay
me
that
sum
which
she
needed
for
her
brother
richard
i
had
not
as
much
money
about
me
but
i
sent
her
the
same
day
a
packet
of
twelve
hundred
francs
with
a
note
in
which
i
begged
her
to
have
recourse
to
me
in
all
her
necessities
her
brother
got
the
money
and
thought
himself
authorized
to
apply
to
me
for
aid
in
a
much
more
important
matter
he
was
a
young
man
and
a
profligate
and
had
got
into
a
house
of
from
which
he
came
out
in
sorry
plight
he
complained
bitterly
that
farsetti
had
refused
to
lend
him
four
louis
and
he
asked
me
to
speak
to
his
mother
that
she
might
pay
for
his
cure
i
consented
but
when
his
mother
heard
what
was
the
matter
with
him
she
said
it
would
be
much
better
to
leave
him
as
he
was
as
this
was
the
third
time
he
had
been
in
this
condition
and
that
to
have
him
cured
was
a
waste
of
money
as
no
sooner
was
he
well
than
he
began
his
dissipated
life
afresh
she
was
quite
right
for
i
had
him
cured
at
my
expense
by
an
able
surgeon
and
he
was
in
the
same
way
a
month
after
this
young
man
seemed
intended
by
nature
for
shameful
excesses
for
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
was
an
accomplished
profligate
his
sister
was
now
six
months
with
child
and
as
her
figure
grew
great
so
did
her
despair
she
resolved
not
to
leave
her
bed
and
it
grieved
me
to
see
her
thus
cast
down
thinking
me
perfectly
cured
of
my
passion
for
her
she
treated
me
purely
as
a
friend
making
me
touch
her
all
over
to
convince
me
that
she
dare
not
shew
herself
any
longer
i
played
in
short
the
part
of
a
midwife
but
with
what
a
struggle
i
had
to
pretend
to
be
calm
and
unconcerned
when
i
was
consumed
with
passion
she
spoke
of
killing
herself
in
a
manner
that
made
me
shudder
as
i
saw
that
she
had
reflected
on
what
she
was
saying
i
was
in
a
difficult
position
when
fortune
came
to
my
assistance
in
a
strange
and
amusing
manner
one
day
as
i
was
dining
with
madame
i
asked
her
if
she
knew
of
any
way
by
which
a
girl
who
had
allowed
her
lover
to
go
too
far
might
be
protected
from
shame
i
know
of
an
infallible
method
she
replied
the
aroph
of
paracelsus
to
wit
and
it
is
easy
of
application
do
you
wish
to
know
more
about
it
she
added
and
without
waiting
for
me
to
answer
she
brought
a
manuscript
and
put
it
in
my
hands
this
powerful
emmenagogue
was
a
kind
of
unguent
composed
of
several
drugs
such
as
saffron
myrrh
compounded
with
virgin
honey
to
obtain
the
necessary
result
one
had
to
employ
a
cylindrical
machine
covered
with
extremely
soft
skin
thick
enough
to
fill
the
opening
of
the
vagina
and
long
enough
to
reach
the
opening
of
the
reservoir
or
case
containing
the
foetus
the
end
of
this
apparatus
was
to
be
well
anointed
with
aroph
and
as
it
only
acted
at
a
moment
of
uterine
excitement
it
was
necessary
to
apply
it
with
the
same
movement
as
that
of
coition
the
dose
had
to
be
repeated
five
or
six
times
a
day
for
a
whole
week
this
nostrum
and
the
manner
of
administering
it
struck
me
in
so
laughable
a
light
that
i
could
not
keep
my
countenance
i
laughed
with
all
my
heart
but
for
all
that
i
spent
the
next
two
hours
in
reading
the
dreams
of
paracelsus
in
which
madame
put
more
trust
than
in
the
truths
of
the
gospel
i
afterwards
referred
to
boerhaave
who
speaks
of
the
aroph
in
more
reasonable
terms
seeing
as
i
have
remarked
the
charming
several
hours
a
day
without
any
kind
of
constraint
feeling
in
love
with
her
all
the
time
and
always
restraining
my
feelings
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
hidden
fire
threatened
at
every
moment
to
leap
up
from
the
ashes
of
its
concealment
her
image
pursued
me
unceasingly
of
her
i
always
thought
and
every
day
made
it
more
evident
that
i
should
know
rest
no
more
till
i
succeeded
in
extinguishing
my
passion
by
obtaining
possession
of
all
her
charms
as
i
was
thinking
of
her
by
myself
i
resolved
to
tell
her
of
my
discovery
hoping
she
would
need
my
help
in
the
introduction
of
the
cylinder
i
went
to
see
her
at
ten
and
found
her
as
usual
in
bed
she
was
weeping
because
the
opiate
i
gave
her
did
not
take
effect
i
thought
the
time
a
good
one
for
introducing
the
aroph
of
paracelsus
which
i
assured
her
was
an
infallible
means
of
attaining
the
end
she
desired
but
whilst
i
was
singing
the
praises
of
this
application
the
idea
came
into
my
head
to
say
that
to
be
absolutely
certain
it
was
necessary
for
the
aroph
to
be
mingled
with
semen
which
had
not
lost
its
natural
heat
this
mixture
said
i
moistening
several
times
a
day
the
opening
of
the
womb
weakens
it
to
such
a
degree
that
the
foetus
is
expelled
by
its
own
weight
to
these
details
i
added
lengthy
arguments
to
persuade
her
of
the
efficacy
of
this
cure
and
then
seeing
that
she
was
absorbed
in
thought
i
said
that
as
her
lover
was
away
she
would
want
a
sure
friend
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
and
give
her
the
dose
according
to
the
directions
of
paracelsus
all
at
once
she
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
asked
me
if
i
had
been
jesting
all
the
time
i
thought
the
game
was
up
the
remedy
was
an
absurd
one
on
the
face
of
it
and
if
her
common
sense
told
her
as
much
it
would
also
make
her
guess
my
motive
but
what
limits
are
there
to
the
credulity
of
a
woman
in
her
condition
if
you
wish
said
i
persuasively
i
will
give
you
the
manuscript
where
all
that
i
have
said
is
set
down
plainly
i
will
also
shew
you
what
boerhaeve
thinks
about
it
i
saw
that
these
words
convinced
her
they
had
acted
on
her
as
if
by
magic
and
i
went
on
while
the
iron
was
hot
the
aroph
said
i
is
the
most
powerful
agent
for
bringing
on
menstruation
and
that
is
incompatible
with
the
state
i
am
now
in
so
the
aroph
should
procure
me
a
secret
deliverance
do
you
know
its
composition
certainly
it
is
quite
a
simple
preparation
composed
of
certain
ingredients
which
are
well
known
to
me
and
which
have
to
be
made
into
a
paste
with
butter
or
virgin
honey
but
this
composition
must
touch
the
orifice
of
the
uterus
at
a
moment
of
extreme
excitement
but
in
that
case
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
who
gives
the
dose
must
be
in
love
certainly
unless
he
is
a
mere
animal
requiring
only
physical
incentives
she
was
silent
for
some
time
for
though
she
was
enough
a
woman
natural
modesty
and
her
own
frankness
prevented
her
from
guessing
at
my
artifice
i
too
astonished
at
my
success
in
making
her
believe
this
fable
remained
silent
at
last
breaking
the
silence
she
said
sadly
the
method
seems
to
me
an
excellent
one
but
i
do
not
think
i
ought
to
make
use
of
it
then
she
asked
me
if
the
aroph
took
much
time
to
make
two
hours
at
most
i
answered
if
i
succeed
in
procuring
english
saffron
which
paracelsus
prefers
to
the
oriental
saffron
at
that
moment
her
mother
and
the
chevalier
farsetti
came
in
and
after
some
talk
of
no
consequence
she
asked
me
to
stay
to
dinner
i
was
going
to
decline
when
mdlle
said
she
would
sit
at
table
on
which
i
accepted
and
we
all
left
the
room
to
give
her
time
to
dress
she
was
not
long
in
dressing
and
when
she
appeared
her
figure
seemed
to
me
quite
i
was
astonished
and
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
thinking
that
i
had
been
imposed
on
for
i
could
not
imagine
how
she
could
manage
to
conceal
the
fulness
i
had
felt
with
my
own
hands
farsetti
sat
by
her
and
i
by
the
mother
mdlle
whose
head
was
full
of
the
aroph
asked
her
neighbour
who
gave
himself
out
for
a
great
chemist
if
he
knew
it
i
fancy
i
know
it
better
than
anyone
answered
farsetti
in
a
manner
what
is
it
good
for
that
is
too
vague
a
question
what
does
the
word
mean
it
is
an
arabic
word
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
but
no
doubt
paracelsus
would
tell
us
the
word
said
i
is
neither
arabic
nor
hebrew
nor
indeed
of
any
language
at
all
it
is
a
contraction
which
conceals
two
other
words
can
you
tell
us
what
they
are
said
the
chevalier
certainly
aro
comes
from
aroma
and
ph
is
the
initial
of
philosophorum
did
you
get
that
out
of
paracelsus
said
farsetti
evidently
annoyed
no
sir
i
saw
it
in
boerhaave
that
good
said
he
sarcastically
boerhaave
says
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
like
a
man
who
quotes
readily
laugh
sir
if
you
like
said
i
proudly
but
here
is
the
test
of
what
i
say
accept
the
wager
if
you
dare
i
do
quote
falsely
like
persons
who
talk
of
words
being
arabic
so
saying
i
flung
a
purse
of
gold
on
the
table
but
farsetti
who
was
by
no
means
sure
of
what
he
was
saying
answered
disdainfully
that
he
never
betted
however
mdlle
enjoying
his
confusion
told
him
that
was
the
best
way
never
to
lose
and
began
to
joke
him
on
his
arabic
derivation
but
for
my
part
i
replaced
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
on
some
trifling
pretext
went
out
and
sent
my
servant
to
madame
to
get
me
boerhaave
on
my
return
to
the
room
i
sat
down
again
at
table
and
joined
gaily
in
the
conversation
till
the
return
of
my
messenger
with
the
book
i
opened
it
and
as
i
had
been
reading
it
the
evening
before
i
soon
found
the
place
i
wanted
and
giving
it
to
him
begged
him
to
satisfy
himself
that
i
had
quoted
not
readily
but
exactly
instead
of
taking
the
book
he
got
up
and
went
out
without
saying
a
word
he
has
gone
away
in
a
rage
said
the
mother
and
i
would
wager
anything
that
he
will
not
come
back
again
i
wager
he
will
said
the
daughter
he
will
honour
us
with
his
agreeable
company
before
sun
has
set
she
was
right
from
that
day
farsetti
became
my
determined
enemy
and
let
no
opportunity
slip
of
convincing
me
of
his
hatred
after
dinner
we
all
went
to
passy
to
be
present
at
a
concert
given
by
de
la
popeliniere
who
made
us
stay
to
supper
i
found
there
silvia
and
her
charming
daughter
who
pouted
at
me
and
not
without
cause
as
i
had
neglected
her
the
famous
adept
germain
enlivened
the
table
with
his
wild
tirades
so
finely
delivered
i
have
never
seen
a
more
intellectual
or
amusing
charlatan
than
he
next
day
i
shut
myself
up
to
answer
a
host
of
questions
that
esther
had
sent
me
i
took
care
to
answer
all
those
bearing
on
business
matters
as
obscurely
as
possible
not
only
for
the
credit
of
the
oracle
but
also
for
fear
of
misleading
the
father
and
making
him
lose
money
the
worthy
man
was
the
most
honest
of
dutch
millionaires
but
he
might
easily
make
a
large
hole
in
his
fortune
if
he
did
not
absolutely
ruin
himself
by
putting
an
implicit
trust
in
my
infallibility
as
for
esther
i
confess
that
she
was
now
no
more
to
me
than
a
pleasant
memory
in
spite
of
my
pretence
of
indifference
my
whole
heart
was
given
to
mdlle
and
i
dreaded
the
moment
when
she
would
be
no
longer
able
to
hide
her
condition
from
her
family
i
was
sorry
for
having
spoken
about
the
aroph
as
three
days
had
gone
by
without
her
mentioning
it
and
i
could
not
very
well
reopen
the
question
myself
i
was
afraid
that
she
suspected
my
motives
and
that
the
esteem
she
professed
for
me
had
been
replaced
by
a
much
less
friendly
sentiment
i
felt
that
her
scorn
would
be
too
much
for
me
to
bear
so
humiliated
was
i
that
i
could
not
visit
her
and
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
seen
her
again
if
she
had
not
intervened
she
wrote
me
a
note
in
which
she
said
i
was
her
only
friend
and
that
the
only
mark
of
friendship
she
wanted
was
that
i
should
come
and
see
her
every
day
if
it
were
but
for
a
moment
i
hasted
to
take
her
my
reply
in
my
own
person
and
promised
not
to
neglect
her
assuring
her
that
at
all
hazards
she
might
rely
on
me
i
flattered
myself
that
she
would
mention
the
aroph
but
she
did
not
do
so
i
concluded
that
after
thinking
it
over
she
had
resolved
to
think
no
more
about
it
would
you
like
me
i
said
to
invite
your
mother
and
the
rest
of
you
to
dine
with
me
i
shall
be
delighted
she
replied
it
will
be
a
forbidden
pleasure
to
me
before
long
i
gave
them
a
dinner
both
sumptuous
and
delicate
i
had
spared
no
expense
to
have
everything
of
the
best
i
had
asked
silvia
her
charming
daughter
an
italian
musician
named
magali
with
whom
a
sister
of
mdlle
was
taken
and
the
famous
bass
la
garde
mdlle
was
in
the
highest
spirits
all
the
time
sallies
of
wit
jests
good
stories
and
enjoyment
were
the
soul
of
the
banquet
we
did
not
separate
till
midnight
and
before
leaving
mdlle
found
a
moment
to
whisper
to
me
to
come
and
see
her
early
next
morning
as
she
wanted
to
speak
to
me
on
matters
of
importance
it
will
be
guessed
that
i
accepted
the
invitation
i
waited
on
her
before
eight
she
was
very
melancholy
and
told
me
that
she
was
in
despair
that
la
popeliniere
pressed
on
the
marriage
and
that
her
mother
persecuted
her
she
tells
me
that
i
must
sign
the
contract
and
that
the
dressmaker
will
soon
be
coming
to
take
my
measure
for
my
wedding
dress
to
that
i
can
not
consent
for
a
dressmaker
would
certainly
see
my
situation
i
will
die
rather
than
confide
in
my
mother
or
marry
before
i
am
delivered
there
is
always
time
enough
to
talk
about
dying
said
i
when
all
other
means
have
failed
i
think
you
could
easily
get
rid
of
la
popeliniere
who
is
a
man
of
honour
tell
him
how
you
are
situated
and
he
will
act
without
compromising
you
as
his
own
interest
is
sufficiently
involved
to
make
him
keep
the
secret
but
should
i
be
much
better
off
then
and
how
about
my
mother
your
mother
oh
i
will
make
her
listen
to
reason
you
know
not
what
she
is
like
the
honour
of
the
family
would
oblige
her
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
but
before
that
she
would
make
me
suffer
torments
to
which
death
is
preferable
by
far
but
why
have
you
said
no
more
about
the
aroph
is
it
not
all
a
jest
it
would
be
a
very
cruel
one
on
the
contrary
i
believe
it
to
be
infallible
though
i
have
never
been
a
witness
of
its
effects
but
what
good
is
it
for
me
to
speak
to
you
you
can
guess
that
a
delicacy
of
feeling
has
made
me
keep
silence
confide
in
your
lover
who
is
at
venice
write
him
a
letter
and
i
will
take
care
that
it
is
given
into
his
hands
in
five
or
six
days
by
a
sure
messenger
if
he
is
not
well
off
i
will
give
you
whatever
money
may
be
needed
for
him
to
come
without
delay
and
save
your
honour
and
life
by
giving
you
the
aroph
this
idea
is
a
good
one
and
the
offer
generous
on
your
part
but
it
is
not
feasible
as
you
would
see
if
you
knew
more
about
my
circumstances
do
not
think
any
more
of
my
lover
but
supposing
i
made
up
my
mind
to
receive
the
aroph
from
another
tell
me
how
it
could
be
done
even
if
my
lover
were
in
paris
how
could
he
spend
an
entire
week
with
me
as
he
would
have
to
and
how
could
he
give
me
the
dose
five
or
six
times
a
day
for
a
week
you
see
yourself
that
this
remedy
is
out
of
the
question
so
you
would
give
yourself
to
another
if
you
thought
that
would
save
your
honour
certainly
if
i
were
sure
that
the
thing
would
be
kept
secret
but
where
shall
i
find
such
a
person
do
you
think
he
would
be
easy
to
find
or
that
i
can
go
and
look
for
him
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
speech
for
she
knew
i
loved
her
and
i
did
not
see
why
she
should
put
herself
to
the
trouble
of
going
far
when
what
she
wanted
was
to
her
hand
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
she
wanted
me
to
ask
her
to
make
choice
of
myself
as
the
administrator
of
the
remedy
either
to
spare
her
modesty
or
to
have
the
merit
of
yielding
to
my
love
and
thus
obliging
me
to
be
grateful
but
i
might
be
wrong
and
i
did
not
care
to
expose
myself
to
the
humiliation
of
a
refusal
on
the
other
hand
i
could
hardly
think
she
wanted
to
insult
me
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
which
way
to
turn
and
wanting
to
draw
an
explanation
from
her
i
sighed
profoundly
took
up
my
hat
and
made
as
if
i
were
going
exclaiming
cruel
girl
my
lot
is
more
wretched
than
yours
she
raised
herself
in
the
bed
and
begged
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
remain
and
asked
me
how
i
could
call
myself
more
wretched
than
her
pretending
to
be
annoyed
and
yet
full
of
love
for
her
i
told
her
that
the
contempt
in
which
she
held
me
had
affected
me
deeply
since
in
her
necessity
she
preferred
the
offices
of
one
who
was
unknown
to
her
rather
than
make
use
of
me
you
are
cruel
and
unjust
she
said
weeping
i
see
for
my
part
that
you
love
me
no
longer
since
you
wish
to
take
advantage
of
my
cruel
necessity
to
gain
a
triumph
over
me
this
is
an
act
of
revenge
not
worthy
of
a
man
of
feeling
her
tears
softened
me
and
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
her
since
you
know
dearest
that
i
worship
you
how
can
you
think
me
capable
of
revenging
myself
on
you
do
you
think
that
i
can
bear
to
hear
you
say
that
since
your
lover
can
not
help
you
you
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
help
but
after
refusing
you
my
favours
could
i
ask
this
office
of
you
with
any
decency
have
i
not
good
reason
to
be
afraid
that
as
i
refused
to
take
pity
on
your
love
so
you
would
refuse
to
take
pity
on
my
necessity
do
you
think
that
a
passionate
lover
ceases
to
love
on
account
of
a
refusal
which
may
be
dictated
by
virtue
let
me
tell
you
all
i
think
i
confess
i
once
thought
you
did
not
love
me
but
now
i
am
sure
of
the
contrary
and
that
your
heart
would
have
led
you
to
satisfy
my
love
even
if
you
had
not
been
thus
situated
i
may
add
that
you
no
doubt
feel
vexed
at
my
having
any
doubts
of
your
love
you
have
interpreted
my
feelings
admirably
but
how
we
are
to
be
together
with
the
necessary
freedom
from
observation
remains
to
be
seen
do
not
be
afraid
now
i
am
sure
of
your
consent
it
will
not
be
long
before
i
contrive
some
plan
in
the
meanwhile
i
will
go
and
make
the
aroph
i
had
resolved
that
if
ever
i
succeeded
in
persuading
mdlle
to
make
use
of
my
specific
i
would
use
nothing
but
honey
so
the
composition
of
the
aroph
would
not
be
a
very
complicated
process
but
if
one
point
was
then
plain
and
simple
another
remained
to
be
solved
and
its
solution
gave
me
some
difficulty
i
should
have
to
pass
several
nights
in
continual
toils
i
feared
i
had
promised
more
than
i
could
perform
and
i
should
not
be
able
to
make
any
abatement
without
hazarding
not
the
success
of
the
aroph
but
the
bliss
i
had
taken
such
pains
to
win
again
as
her
younger
sister
slept
in
the
same
room
with
her
and
close
to
her
the
operation
could
not
be
performed
there
at
last
chance
a
divinity
which
often
helps
lovers
came
to
my
aid
i
was
obliged
to
climb
up
to
the
fourth
floor
and
met
the
scullion
on
my
way
who
guessed
where
i
was
going
and
begged
me
not
to
go
any
farther
as
the
place
was
taken
but
said
i
you
have
just
come
out
of
it
yes
but
i
only
went
in
and
came
out
again
then
i
will
wait
till
the
coast
is
clear
for
goodness
sake
sir
do
not
wait
ah
you
rascal
i
see
what
is
going
on
well
i
will
say
nothing
about
it
but
i
must
see
her
she
wo
come
out
for
she
heard
your
steps
and
shut
herself
in
she
knows
me
does
she
yes
and
you
know
her
all
right
get
along
with
you
i
wo
say
anything
about
it
he
went
down
and
the
idea
immediately
struck
me
that
the
adventure
might
be
useful
to
me
i
went
up
to
the
top
and
through
a
chink
i
saw
madelaine
mdlle
maid
i
reassured
her
and
promised
to
keep
the
secret
whereon
she
opened
the
door
and
after
i
had
given
her
a
louis
fled
in
some
confusion
soon
after
i
came
down
and
the
scullion
who
was
waiting
for
me
on
the
landing
begged
me
to
make
madelaine
give
him
half
the
louis
i
will
give
you
one
all
to
yourself
said
i
if
you
will
tell
me
the
story
an
offer
which
pleased
the
rogue
well
enough
he
told
me
the
tale
of
his
loves
and
said
he
always
spent
the
night
with
her
in
the
garret
but
that
for
three
days
they
had
been
deprived
of
their
pleasures
as
madam
had
locked
the
door
and
taken
away
the
key
i
made
him
shew
me
the
place
and
looking
through
the
keyhole
i
saw
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
a
mattress
i
gave
the
scullion
a
louis
and
went
away
to
ripen
my
plans
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
no
reason
why
the
mistress
should
not
sleep
in
the
garret
as
well
as
the
maid
i
got
a
picklock
and
several
skeleton
keys
i
put
in
a
tin
box
several
doses
of
the
is
some
honey
mixed
with
pounded
stag
horn
to
make
it
thick
enough
and
the
next
morning
i
went
to
the
hotel
de
bretagne
and
immediately
tried
my
picklock
i
could
have
done
without
it
as
the
first
skeleton
key
i
tried
opened
the
wornout
lock
proud
of
my
idea
i
went
down
to
see
mdlle
and
in
a
few
words
told
her
the
plan
but
said
she
i
should
have
to
go
through
madelaine
room
to
get
to
the
garret
in
that
case
dearest
we
must
win
the
girl
over
tell
her
my
secret
just
so
oh
i
could
i
will
see
to
it
the
golden
key
opens
all
doors
the
girl
consented
to
all
i
asked
her
but
the
scullion
troubled
me
for
if
he
found
us
out
he
might
be
dangerous
i
thought
however
that
i
might
trust
to
madelaine
who
was
a
girl
of
wit
to
look
after
him
before
going
i
told
the
girl
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
some
important
matters
with
her
and
i
told
her
to
meet
me
in
the
cloisters
of
the
augustinian
church
she
came
at
the
appointed
time
and
i
explained
to
her
the
whole
plan
in
all
its
details
she
soon
understood
me
and
after
telling
me
that
she
would
take
care
to
put
her
own
bed
in
the
new
kind
of
boudoir
she
added
that
to
be
quite
safe
we
must
make
sure
of
the
scullion
he
is
a
sharp
lad
said
madelaine
and
i
think
i
can
answer
for
him
however
you
may
leave
that
to
me
i
gave
her
the
key
and
six
louis
bidding
her
inform
her
mistress
of
what
we
had
agreed
upon
and
get
the
garret
ready
to
receive
us
she
went
away
quite
merry
a
maid
who
is
in
love
is
never
so
happy
as
when
she
can
make
her
mistress
protect
her
intrigues
next
morning
the
scullion
called
on
me
at
my
house
the
first
thing
i
told
him
was
to
take
care
not
to
betray
himself
to
my
servants
and
never
to
come
and
see
me
except
in
a
case
of
necessity
he
promised
discretion
and
assured
me
of
his
devotion
to
my
service
he
gave
me
the
key
of
the
garret
and
told
me
that
he
had
got
another
i
admired
his
forethought
and
gave
him
a
present
of
six
louis
which
had
more
effect
on
him
than
the
finest
words
next
morning
i
only
saw
mdlle
for
a
moment
to
warn
her
that
i
should
be
at
the
appointed
place
at
ten
that
evening
i
went
there
early
without
being
seen
by
anybody
i
was
in
a
cloak
and
carried
in
my
pocket
the
aroph
flint
and
steel
and
a
candle
i
found
a
good
bed
pillows
and
a
thick
coverlet
a
very
useful
provision
as
the
nights
were
cold
and
we
should
require
some
sleep
in
the
intervals
of
the
operation
at
eleven
a
slight
noise
made
my
heart
begin
to
beat
always
a
good
sign
i
went
out
and
found
my
mistress
by
feeling
for
her
and
reassured
her
by
a
tender
kiss
i
brought
her
in
barricaded
the
door
and
took
care
to
cover
up
the
keyhole
to
baffle
the
curious
and
if
the
worse
happened
to
avoid
a
surprise
on
my
lighting
the
candle
she
seemed
uneasy
and
said
that
the
light
might
discover
us
if
anybody
came
up
to
the
fourth
floor
that
not
likely
i
said
and
besides
we
ca
do
without
it
for
how
am
i
to
give
you
the
aroph
in
the
dark
very
good
she
replied
we
can
put
it
out
afterwards
without
staying
for
those
preliminary
dallyings
which
are
so
sweet
when
one
is
at
ease
we
undressed
ourselves
and
began
with
all
seriousness
to
play
our
part
which
we
did
to
perfection
we
looked
like
a
medical
student
about
to
perform
an
operation
and
she
like
a
patient
with
this
difference
that
it
was
the
patient
who
arranged
the
dressing
when
she
was
ready
that
is
when
she
had
placed
the
aroph
as
neatly
as
a
fits
a
parson
she
put
herself
in
the
proper
position
for
the
preparation
to
mix
with
the
semen
the
most
laughable
part
of
it
all
was
that
we
were
both
as
serious
as
two
doctors
of
divinity
when
the
introduction
of
the
aroph
was
perfect
the
timid
lady
put
out
the
candle
but
a
few
minutes
after
it
had
to
be
lighted
again
i
told
her
politely
that
i
was
delighted
to
begin
again
and
the
voice
in
which
i
paid
her
this
compliment
made
us
both
burst
into
laughter
i
did
take
so
short
a
time
over
my
second
operation
as
my
first
and
my
sweetheart
who
had
been
a
little
put
out
was
now
quite
at
her
ease
her
modesty
had
now
been
replaced
by
confidence
and
as
she
was
looking
at
the
aroph
fitted
in
its
place
she
shewed
me
with
her
pretty
finger
very
evident
signs
of
her
in
the
work
then
with
an
affectionate
air
she
asked
me
if
i
would
not
like
to
rest
as
we
had
still
a
good
deal
to
do
before
our
work
was
at
an
end
you
see
said
i
that
i
do
not
need
rest
and
i
think
we
had
better
set
to
again
no
doubt
she
found
my
reason
a
good
one
for
without
saying
anything
she
put
herself
ready
to
begin
again
and
afterwards
we
took
a
good
long
sleep
when
i
woke
up
feeling
as
fresh
as
ever
i
asked
her
to
try
another
operation
and
after
carrying
this
through
successfully
i
determined
to
be
guided
by
her
and
take
care
of
myself
for
we
had
to
reserve
our
energies
for
the
following
nights
so
about
four
in
the
morning
she
left
me
and
softly
made
her
way
to
her
room
and
at
daybreak
i
left
the
hotel
under
the
protection
of
the
scullion
who
took
me
by
a
private
door
i
did
not
know
of
about
noon
after
taking
an
aromatic
bath
i
went
to
call
on
mdlle
whom
i
found
sitting
up
in
bed
as
usual
elegantly
attired
and
with
a
happy
smile
on
her
lips
she
spoke
at
such
length
on
her
gratitude
and
thanked
me
so
often
that
believing
myself
and
with
good
cause
to
be
her
debtor
i
began
to
get
impatient
is
it
possible
i
said
that
you
do
not
see
how
degrading
your
thanks
are
to
me
they
prove
that
you
do
not
love
me
or
that
if
you
love
me
you
think
my
love
less
strong
than
yours
our
conversation
then
took
a
tender
turn
and
we
were
about
to
seal
our
mutual
ardours
without
troubling
about
the
aroph
when
prudence
bade
us
beware
it
would
not
have
been
safe
and
we
had
plenty
of
time
before
us
we
contented
ourselves
with
a
tender
embrace
till
the
night
should
come
my
situation
was
a
peculiar
one
for
though
i
was
in
love
with
this
charming
girl
i
did
not
feel
in
the
least
ashamed
of
having
deceived
her
especially
as
what
i
did
could
have
no
effect
the
place
being
taken
it
was
my
which
made
me
congratulate
myself
on
the
sharp
practice
which
had
procured
me
such
pleasures
she
told
me
that
she
was
sorry
she
had
denied
me
when
i
had
asked
her
before
and
said
that
she
felt
now
that
i
had
good
reason
to
suspect
the
reality
of
her
love
i
did
my
best
to
reassure
her
and
indeed
all
suspicions
on
my
part
would
have
been
but
idle
thoughts
as
i
had
succeeded
beyond
all
expectation
however
there
is
one
point
upon
which
i
congratulate
myself
to
this
day
namely
that
during
those
nightly
toils
of
mine
which
did
so
little
towards
the
object
of
her
desires
i
succeeded
in
inspiring
her
with
such
a
feeling
of
resignation
that
she
promised
of
her
own
accord
not
to
despair
any
more
but
to
trust
in
and
be
guided
by
me
she
often
told
me
during
our
nocturnal
conversations
that
she
was
happy
and
would
continue
to
be
so
even
though
the
aroph
had
no
effect
not
that
she
had
ceased
to
believe
in
it
for
she
continued
the
application
of
the
harmless
preparation
till
our
last
assaults
in
which
we
wanted
in
those
sweet
combats
to
exhaust
all
the
gifts
of
pleasure
sweetheart
said
she
just
before
we
parted
finally
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
been
about
is
much
more
likely
to
create
than
to
destroy
and
if
the
aperture
had
not
been
hermetically
closed
we
should
doubtless
have
given
the
little
prisoner
a
companion
a
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
could
not
have
reasoned
better
three
or
four
days
afterwards
i
found
her
thoughtful
but
quiet
she
told
me
that
she
had
lost
all
hope
of
getting
rid
of
her
burden
before
the
proper
time
all
the
while
however
her
mother
persecuted
her
and
she
would
have
to
choose
in
a
few
days
between
making
a
declaration
as
to
her
state
and
signing
the
marriage
contract
she
would
accept
neither
of
these
alternatives
and
had
decided
on
escaping
from
her
home
and
asked
me
to
help
her
in
doing
so
i
had
determined
to
help
her
but
i
desired
to
save
my
reputation
for
it
might
have
been
troublesome
if
it
had
been
absolutely
known
that
i
had
carried
her
off
or
furnished
her
with
the
means
to
escape
and
as
for
any
other
alternative
neither
of
us
had
any
idea
of
matrimony
i
left
her
and
went
to
the
tuileries
where
a
sacred
concert
was
being
given
the
piece
was
a
motet
composed
by
moudonville
the
words
by
the
abbe
de
voisenon
whom
i
had
furnished
with
the
idea
the
israelites
on
mount
horeb
as
i
was
getting
out
of
my
carriage
i
saw
madame
du
remain
descending
alone
from
hers
i
ran
up
to
her
and
received
a
hearty
welcome
i
am
delighted
said
she
to
find
you
here
it
is
quite
a
piece
of
luck
i
am
going
to
hear
this
novel
composition
and
have
two
reserved
seats
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
accepting
one
although
i
had
my
ticket
in
my
pocket
i
could
not
refuse
so
honourable
an
offer
so
giving
her
my
arm
we
walked
up
to
two
of
the
best
places
in
the
house
at
paris
no
talking
is
allowed
during
the
performance
of
sacred
music
especially
when
the
piece
is
heard
for
the
first
time
so
madame
du
remain
could
draw
no
conclusions
from
my
silence
throughout
the
performance
but
she
guessed
that
something
was
the
matter
from
the
troubled
and
absent
expression
of
my
face
which
was
by
no
means
natural
to
me
casanova
said
she
be
good
enough
to
give
me
your
company
for
an
hour
i
want
to
ask
or
three
questions
which
can
only
be
solved
by
your
cabala
i
hope
you
will
oblige
me
as
i
am
very
anxious
to
know
the
answers
but
we
must
be
quick
as
i
have
an
engagement
to
sup
in
paris
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
and
as
soon
as
we
got
to
her
house
i
went
to
work
on
the
questions
and
solved
them
all
in
less
than
half
an
hour
when
i
had
finished
casanova
said
she
in
the
kindest
manner
possible
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
not
in
your
usual
state
of
equanimity
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
are
dreading
some
dire
event
or
perhaps
you
are
on
the
eve
of
taking
some
important
resolution
i
am
not
inquisitive
but
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
at
court
make
use
of
me
and
be
sure
that
i
will
do
my
best
if
necessary
i
will
go
to
versailles
morning
i
know
all
the
ministers
confide
in
me
your
troubles
if
i
can
not
lighten
them
i
can
at
least
share
them
and
be
sure
i
will
keep
your
counsel
her
words
seemed
to
me
a
voice
from
heaven
a
warning
from
my
good
genius
to
open
my
heart
to
this
lady
who
had
almost
read
my
thoughts
and
had
so
plainly
expressed
her
interest
in
my
welfare
after
gazing
at
her
for
some
seconds
without
speaking
but
with
a
manner
that
shewed
her
how
grateful
i
was
yes
madam
i
said
i
am
indeed
critically
situated
may
be
on
the
serge
of
ruin
but
your
kindness
has
calmed
my
soul
and
made
me
once
more
acquainted
with
hope
you
shall
hear
how
i
am
placed
i
am
going
to
trust
you
with
a
secret
of
the
most
delicate
description
but
i
can
rely
on
your
being
as
discreet
as
you
are
good
and
if
after
hearing
my
story
you
deign
to
give
me
your
advice
i
promise
to
follow
it
and
never
to
divulge
its
author
after
this
beginning
which
gained
her
close
attention
i
told
her
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
neither
concealing
the
young
lady
name
nor
any
of
the
circumstances
which
made
it
my
duty
to
watch
over
her
welfare
all
the
same
i
said
nothing
about
the
aroph
or
the
share
i
had
taken
in
its
exhibition
the
incident
appeared
to
me
too
farcical
for
a
serious
drama
but
i
confessed
that
i
had
procured
the
girl
drugs
in
the
hope
of
relieving
her
of
her
burden
after
this
weighty
communication
i
stopped
and
madame
du
rumain
remained
silent
as
if
lost
in
thought
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
last
she
rose
saying
i
am
expected
at
madame
de
la
marque
and
i
must
go
as
i
am
to
meet
the
bishop
of
montrouge
to
whom
i
want
to
speak
but
i
hope
i
shall
eventually
be
able
to
help
you
come
here
the
day
after
tomorrow
you
will
find
me
alone
above
all
do
nothing
before
you
see
me
farewell
i
left
her
full
of
hope
and
resolved
to
follow
her
advice
and
hers
only
in
the
troublesome
affair
in
which
i
was
involved
the
bishop
of
montrouge
whom
she
was
going
to
address
on
an
important
matter
the
nature
of
which
was
well
known
to
me
was
the
abbe
de
voisenon
who
was
thus
named
because
he
often
went
there
montrouge
is
an
estate
near
paris
belonging
to
the
duc
de
la
valiere
i
saw
mdlle
the
following
day
and
contented
myself
with
telling
her
that
in
a
couple
of
days
i
hope
to
give
her
some
good
news
i
was
pleased
with
her
manner
which
was
full
of
resignation
and
trust
in
my
endeavours
the
day
after
i
went
to
madame
du
rumain
punctually
at
eight
the
porter
told
me
that
i
should
find
the
doctor
with
my
lady
but
i
went
upstairs
all
the
same
and
as
soon
as
the
doctor
saw
me
he
took
his
leave
his
name
was
herrenschwand
and
all
the
ladies
in
paris
ran
after
him
poor
poinsinet
put
him
in
a
little
play
called
le
cercle
which
though
of
very
ordinary
merit
was
a
great
success
my
dear
sir
said
madame
du
rumain
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
i
have
succeeded
in
my
endeavours
on
your
behalf
and
it
is
now
for
you
to
keep
secret
my
share
in
the
matter
after
i
had
pondered
over
the
case
of
conscience
you
submitted
to
me
i
went
to
the
convent
of
c
the
abbess
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
entrusted
her
with
the
secret
relying
on
her
discretion
we
agreed
that
she
should
receive
the
young
lady
in
her
convent
and
give
her
a
good
to
nurse
her
through
her
confinement
now
you
will
not
deny
said
she
with
a
smile
that
the
cloisters
are
of
some
use
your
young
friend
must
go
by
herself
to
the
convent
with
a
letter
for
the
abbess
which
i
will
give
her
and
which
she
must
deliver
to
the
porter
she
will
then
be
admitted
and
lodged
in
a
suitable
chamber
she
will
receive
no
visitors
nor
any
letters
that
have
not
passed
through
my
hands
the
abbess
will
bring
her
answers
to
me
and
i
will
pass
them
on
to
you
you
must
see
that
her
only
correspondent
must
be
yourself
and
you
must
receive
news
of
her
welfare
only
through
me
on
your
hand
in
writing
to
her
you
must
leave
the
address
to
be
filled
in
by
me
i
had
to
tell
the
abbess
the
lady
name
but
not
yours
as
she
did
not
require
it
tell
your
young
friend
all
about
our
plans
and
when
she
is
ready
come
and
tell
me
and
i
will
give
you
the
letter
to
the
abbess
tell
her
to
bring
nothing
but
what
is
strictly
necessary
above
all
no
diamonds
or
trinkets
of
any
value
you
may
assure
her
that
the
abbess
will
be
friendly
will
come
and
see
her
every
now
and
then
will
give
her
proper
books
in
a
word
that
she
will
be
well
looked
after
warn
her
not
to
confide
in
the
laysister
who
will
attend
on
her
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
an
excellent
woman
but
she
is
a
nun
and
the
secret
might
leak
out
after
she
is
safely
delivered
she
must
go
to
confession
and
perform
her
easter
duties
and
the
abbess
will
give
her
a
certificate
of
good
behaviour
and
she
can
then
return
to
her
mother
who
will
be
too
happy
to
see
her
to
say
anything
more
about
the
marriage
which
of
course
she
ought
to
give
as
her
reason
of
her
leaving
home
after
many
expressions
of
my
gratitude
to
her
and
of
my
admiration
of
her
plan
i
begged
her
to
give
me
the
letter
on
the
spot
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
she
was
good
enough
to
go
at
once
to
her
desk
where
she
wrote
as
follows
my
dear
abbess
the
young
lady
who
will
give
you
this
letter
is
the
same
of
whom
we
have
spoken
she
wishes
to
spend
three
of
four
months
under
your
protection
to
recover
her
peace
of
mind
to
perform
her
devotions
and
to
make
sure
that
when
she
returns
to
her
mother
nothing
more
will
be
said
about
the
marriage
which
is
partly
the
cause
of
her
temporary
separation
from
her
family
after
reading
it
to
me
she
put
it
into
my
hands
unsealed
that
mdlle
might
be
able
to
read
it
the
abbess
in
question
was
a
princess
and
her
convent
was
consequently
a
place
above
all
suspicion
as
madame
du
rumain
gave
me
the
letter
i
felt
such
an
impulse
of
gratitude
that
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
her
this
generous
woman
was
useful
to
me
on
another
occasion
of
which
i
shall
speak
later
on
after
leaving
madame
du
rumain
i
went
straight
to
the
hotel
de
bretagne
where
i
saw
mdlle
who
had
only
time
to
tell
me
that
she
was
engaged
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
that
she
would
come
to
the
garret
at
eleven
that
night
and
that
then
we
could
talk
matters
over
i
was
overjoyed
at
this
arrangement
as
i
foresaw
that
after
this
would
come
the
awakening
from
a
happy
dream
and
that
i
should
be
alone
with
her
no
more
before
leaving
the
hotel
i
gave
the
word
to
madelaine
who
in
turn
got
the
scullion
to
have
everything
in
readiness
i
kept
the
appointment
and
had
not
long
to
wait
for
my
mistress
after
making
her
read
the
letter
written
by
madame
du
rumain
whose
name
i
withheld
from
her
without
her
taking
offence
thereat
i
put
out
the
candle
and
without
troubling
about
the
aroph
we
set
ourselves
to
the
pleasant
task
of
proving
that
we
truly
loved
each
other
in
the
morning
before
we
separated
i
gave
her
all
the
instructions
i
had
received
from
madame
du
rumain
and
we
agreed
that
she
should
leave
the
house
at
eight
with
such
things
as
she
absolutely
required
that
she
should
take
a
coach
to
the
place
maubert
then
send
it
away
and
take
another
to
the
place
antoine
and
again
farther
on
a
third
coach
in
which
she
was
to
go
to
the
convent
named
i
begged
her
not
to
forget
to
burn
all
the
letters
she
had
received
from
me
and
to
write
to
me
from
the
convent
as
often
as
she
could
to
seal
her
letters
but
to
leave
the
address
blank
she
promised
to
carry
out
my
instructions
and
i
then
made
her
accept
a
packet
of
two
hundred
louis
of
which
she
might
chance
to
be
in
need
she
wept
more
for
my
situation
than
her
own
but
i
consoled
her
by
saying
that
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
powerful
patrons
i
will
set
out
said
she
the
day
after
at
the
hour
agreed
on
and
thereupon
i
having
promised
to
come
to
the
house
the
day
after
her
departure
as
if
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
to
let
her
know
what
passed
we
embraced
each
other
tenderly
and
i
left
her
i
was
troubled
in
thinking
about
her
fate
she
had
wit
and
courage
but
when
experience
is
wanting
wit
often
leads
men
to
commit
acts
of
great
folly
the
day
after
the
morrow
i
took
a
coach
and
posted
myself
in
a
corner
of
the
street
by
which
she
had
to
pass
i
saw
her
come
get
out
of
the
coach
pay
the
coachman
go
down
a
narrow
street
and
a
few
minutes
after
reappear
again
veiled
and
hooded
carrying
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
she
then
took
another
conveyance
which
went
off
in
the
direction
we
had
agreed
upon
the
day
following
being
low
sunday
i
felt
that
i
must
present
myself
at
the
hotel
de
bretagne
for
as
i
went
there
every
day
before
the
daughter
flight
i
could
not
stop
going
there
without
strengthening
any
suspicions
which
might
be
entertained
about
me
but
it
was
a
painful
task
i
had
to
appear
at
my
ease
and
cheerful
in
a
place
where
i
was
quite
sure
all
would
be
sadness
and
confusion
i
must
say
that
it
was
an
affair
requiring
higher
powers
of
impudence
than
fall
to
the
lot
of
most
men
i
chose
a
time
when
all
the
family
would
be
together
at
table
and
i
walked
straight
into
the
i
entered
with
my
usual
cheerful
manner
and
sat
down
by
madame
a
little
behind
her
pretending
not
to
see
her
surprise
which
however
was
plainly
to
be
seen
her
whole
face
being
flushed
with
rage
and
astonishment
i
had
not
been
long
in
the
room
before
i
asked
where
her
daughter
was
she
turned
round
looked
me
through
and
through
and
said
not
a
word
is
she
ill
said
i
i
know
nothing
about
her
this
remark
which
was
pronounced
in
a
dry
manner
put
me
at
my
ease
as
i
now
felt
at
liberty
to
look
concerned
i
sat
there
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
playing
the
part
of
grave
and
astonished
silence
and
then
rising
i
asked
if
i
could
do
anything
for
which
all
my
reward
was
a
cold
expression
of
thanks
i
then
left
the
room
and
went
to
mdlle
chamber
as
if
i
had
thought
she
was
there
but
found
only
madelaine
i
asked
her
with
a
meaning
look
where
her
mistress
was
she
replied
by
begging
me
to
tell
her
if
i
knew
has
she
gone
by
herself
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
sir
but
they
say
you
know
all
i
beg
of
you
to
leave
me
pretending
to
be
in
the
greatest
astonishment
i
slowly
walked
away
and
took
a
coach
glad
to
have
accomplished
this
painful
duty
after
the
reception
i
had
met
with
i
could
without
affectation
pose
as
offended
and
visit
the
family
no
more
for
whether
i
were
guilty
or
innocent
madame
must
see
that
her
manner
had
been
plain
enough
for
me
to
know
what
it
meant
i
was
looking
out
of
my
window
at
an
early
hour
two
or
three
days
afterwards
when
a
coach
stopped
before
my
door
and
madame
x
c
escorted
by
farsetti
got
out
i
made
haste
to
meet
them
on
the
stair
and
welcomed
them
saying
i
was
glad
they
had
done
me
the
honour
to
come
and
take
breakfast
with
me
pretending
not
to
know
of
any
other
reason
i
asked
them
to
sit
down
before
the
fire
and
enquired
after
the
health
but
without
noticing
my
question
she
said
that
she
had
not
come
to
take
breakfast
but
to
have
some
serious
conversation
madam
said
i
i
am
your
humble
servant
but
first
of
all
pray
be
seated
she
sat
down
while
farsetti
continued
standing
i
did
not
press
him
but
turning
towards
the
lady
begged
her
to
command
me
i
am
come
here
she
said
to
ask
you
to
give
me
my
daughter
if
she
be
in
your
power
or
to
tell
me
where
she
is
your
daughter
madam
i
know
nothing
about
her
do
you
think
me
capable
of
a
crime
i
do
not
accuse
you
of
abducting
her
i
have
not
come
here
to
reproach
you
nor
to
utter
threats
i
have
only
come
to
ask
you
to
shew
yourself
my
friend
help
me
to
get
my
daughter
again
this
very
day
you
will
give
me
my
life
i
am
certain
that
you
know
all
you
were
her
only
confidant
and
her
only
friend
you
passed
hours
with
her
every
day
she
must
have
told
you
of
her
secret
pity
a
bereaved
mother
so
far
no
one
knows
of
the
facts
give
her
back
to
me
and
all
shall
be
forgotten
and
her
honour
saved
madam
i
feel
for
you
acutely
but
i
repeat
that
i
know
nothing
of
your
daughter
the
poor
woman
whose
grief
touched
me
fell
at
my
feet
and
burst
into
tears
i
was
going
to
lift
her
from
the
ground
when
farsetti
told
her
in
a
voice
full
of
indignation
that
she
should
blush
to
humble
herself
in
such
a
manner
before
a
man
of
my
description
i
drew
myself
up
and
looking
at
him
scornfully
said
you
insolent
scoundrel
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
of
me
like
that
everybody
is
certain
that
you
know
all
about
it
then
they
are
impudent
fools
like
you
get
out
of
my
house
this
instant
and
wait
for
me
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
saying
i
took
the
poor
chevalier
by
the
shoulders
and
giving
him
sundry
shakes
i
turned
him
out
of
the
room
he
came
back
and
called
to
the
lady
to
come
too
but
she
rose
and
tried
to
quiet
me
you
ought
to
be
more
considerate
towards
a
lover
said
she
for
he
would
marry
my
daughter
now
even
after
what
she
has
done
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
madam
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
courtship
was
one
of
the
chief
reasons
which
made
your
daughter
resolve
to
leave
her
home
for
she
hated
him
even
more
than
she
hated
the
she
has
behaved
very
badly
but
i
promise
not
to
say
anything
more
about
marrying
her
but
i
am
sure
you
know
all
about
it
as
you
gave
her
fifty
louis
without
which
she
could
not
have
done
anything
nay
not
so
do
not
deny
it
sir
here
is
the
evidence
a
small
piece
of
your
letter
to
her
she
gave
me
a
scrap
of
the
letter
i
had
sent
the
daughter
with
the
fifty
louis
for
her
brother
it
contained
the
following
lines
i
hope
that
these
wretched
louis
will
convince
you
that
i
am
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
my
life
if
need
be
to
assure
you
of
my
affection
i
am
far
from
disavowing
this
evidence
of
my
esteem
for
your
daughter
but
to
justify
myself
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
a
fact
which
i
should
have
otherwise
kept
secret
namely
that
i
furnished
your
daughter
with
this
sum
to
enable
her
to
pay
your
son
debts
for
which
he
thanked
me
in
a
letter
which
i
can
shew
you
my
son
your
son
madam
i
will
make
you
an
ample
atonement
for
my
suspicions
before
i
had
time
to
make
any
objection
she
ran
down
to
fetch
farsetti
who
was
waiting
in
the
courtyard
and
made
him
come
up
and
hear
what
i
had
just
told
her
that
not
a
likely
tale
said
the
insolent
fellow
i
looked
at
him
contemptuously
and
told
him
he
was
not
worth
convincing
but
that
i
would
beg
the
lady
to
ask
her
son
and
see
whether
i
told
the
truth
i
assure
you
i
added
that
i
always
urged
your
daughter
to
marry
de
la
popeliniere
how
can
you
have
the
face
to
say
that
said
farsetti
when
you
talk
in
the
letter
of
your
affection
i
do
not
deny
it
said
i
i
loved
her
and
i
was
proud
of
my
affection
for
her
this
affection
of
whatever
sort
it
may
have
been
and
that
is
not
this
gentleman
business
was
the
ordinary
topic
of
conversation
between
us
if
she
had
told
me
that
she
was
going
to
leave
her
home
i
should
either
have
dissuaded
her
or
gone
with
her
for
i
loved
her
as
i
do
at
this
moment
but
i
would
never
have
given
her
money
to
go
alone
my
dear
casanova
said
the
mother
if
you
will
help
me
to
find
her
i
shall
believe
in
your
innocence
i
shall
be
delighted
to
aid
you
and
i
promise
to
commence
the
quest
as
soon
as
you
have
any
news
come
and
tell
me
you
may
trust
me
to
do
so
said
i
and
we
parted
i
had
to
play
my
part
carefully
especially
it
was
essential
that
i
should
behave
in
public
in
a
manner
consistent
with
my
professions
accordingly
the
next
day
i
went
to
chaban
first
commissary
of
police
requesting
him
to
institute
enquiries
respecting
the
flight
of
mdlle
i
was
sure
that
in
this
way
the
real
part
i
had
taken
in
the
matter
would
be
the
better
concealed
but
the
commissary
who
had
the
true
spirit
of
his
profession
and
had
liked
me
when
he
first
saw
me
six
years
before
began
to
laugh
when
he
heard
what
i
wanted
him
to
do
do
you
really
want
the
police
to
discover
said
he
where
the
pretty
englishwoman
is
to
be
found
certainly
it
then
struck
me
that
he
was
trying
to
make
me
talk
and
to
catch
me
tripping
and
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
when
i
met
farsetti
going
in
as
i
was
coming
out
next
day
i
went
to
acquaint
madame
with
the
steps
i
had
taken
though
as
yet
my
efforts
had
not
been
crowned
with
success
i
have
been
more
fortunate
than
you
said
she
and
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
place
where
my
daughter
has
gone
and
will
join
me
in
persuading
her
to
return
all
will
be
well
certainly
said
i
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
accompany
you
taking
me
at
my
word
she
put
on
her
cloak
and
leaning
on
my
arm
walked
along
till
we
came
to
a
coach
she
then
gave
me
a
slip
of
paper
begging
me
to
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
us
to
the
address
thereon
i
was
on
thorns
and
my
heart
beat
fast
for
i
thought
i
should
have
to
read
out
the
address
of
the
convent
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
my
fears
had
been
well
grounded
but
i
should
certainly
not
have
gone
to
the
convent
at
last
i
read
what
was
written
it
was
place
maubert
and
i
grew
calm
once
more
i
told
the
coachman
to
drive
us
to
the
place
maubert
we
set
off
and
in
a
short
time
stopped
at
the
opening
of
an
obscure
back
street
before
a
house
which
did
not
give
one
a
high
idea
of
the
character
of
its
occupants
i
gave
madame
my
arm
and
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
looking
into
every
room
in
the
five
floors
of
the
house
but
what
she
sought
for
was
not
there
and
i
expected
to
see
her
overwhelmed
with
grief
i
was
mistaken
however
she
looked
distressed
but
satisfied
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
ask
pardon
of
me
she
had
found
out
from
the
coachman
who
had
taken
her
daughter
on
the
first
stage
of
her
journey
that
she
had
alighted
in
front
of
the
house
in
question
and
had
gone
down
the
back
street
she
told
me
that
the
scullion
had
confessed
that
he
had
taken
me
letters
twice
from
his
young
mistress
and
that
madelaine
said
all
the
time
that
she
was
sure
her
mistress
and
i
were
in
love
with
each
other
they
played
their
parts
well
as
soon
as
i
had
seen
madame
safely
home
i
went
to
madame
du
rumain
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
and
i
then
wrote
to
my
fair
recluse
telling
her
what
had
gone
on
in
the
world
since
her
disappearance
three
or
four
days
after
this
date
madame
du
rumain
gave
me
the
first
letter
i
received
from
mdlle
she
spoke
in
it
of
the
quiet
life
she
was
leading
and
her
gratitude
to
me
praised
the
abbess
and
the
and
gave
me
the
titles
of
the
books
they
lent
her
which
she
liked
reading
she
also
informed
me
what
money
she
had
spent
and
said
she
was
happy
in
everything
almost
in
being
forbidden
to
leave
her
room
i
was
delighted
with
her
letter
but
much
more
with
the
abbess
epistle
to
madame
du
rumain
she
was
evidently
fond
of
the
girl
and
could
not
say
too
much
in
her
praise
saying
how
clever
and
she
was
winding
up
by
assuring
her
friend
that
she
went
to
see
her
every
day
i
was
charmed
to
see
the
pleasure
this
letter
afforded
madame
du
rumain
pleasure
which
was
increased
by
the
perusal
of
the
letter
i
had
received
the
only
persons
who
were
displeased
were
the
poor
mother
the
frightful
farsetti
and
the
old
fermier
whose
misfortune
was
talked
about
in
the
clubs
the
and
the
everybody
put
me
down
for
some
share
in
the
business
but
i
laughed
at
their
gossip
believing
that
i
was
quite
safe
all
the
same
la
popeliniere
took
the
adventure
philosophically
and
made
a
play
out
of
it
which
he
had
acted
at
his
little
theatre
in
paris
three
months
afterwards
he
got
married
to
a
very
pretty
girl
the
daughter
of
a
bordeaux
alderman
he
died
in
the
course
of
two
years
leaving
his
widow
pregnant
with
a
son
who
came
into
the
world
six
months
after
the
father
death
the
unworthy
heir
to
the
rich
man
had
the
face
to
accuse
the
widow
of
adultery
and
got
the
child
declared
illegitimate
to
the
eternal
shame
of
the
court
which
gave
this
iniquitous
judgment
and
to
the
grief
of
every
honest
frenchman
the
iniquitous
nature
of
the
judgment
was
afterwards
more
clearly
demonstrated
putting
aside
the
fact
that
nothing
could
be
said
against
the
mother
character
by
the
same
court
having
the
face
to
declare
a
child
born
eleven
months
after
the
father
death
legitimate
i
continued
for
ten
days
to
call
upon
madame
but
finding
myself
coldly
welcomed
decided
to
go

de

mdlle
had
now
been
in
the
convent
for
a
month
and
her
affair
had
ceased
to
be
a
common
topic
of
conversation
i
thought
i
should
hear
no
more
of
it
but
i
was
mistaken
i
continued
however
to
amuse
myself
and
my
pleasure
in
spending
freely
quite
prevented
me
from
thinking
about
the
future
the
abbe
de
bernis
whom
i
went
to
see
regularly
once
a
week
told
me
one
day
that
the
often
enquired
how
i
was
getting
on
you
are
wrong
said
the
abbe
to
neglect
him
he
advised
me
to
say
no
more
about
my
claims
but
to
communicate
to
him
the
means
i
had
spoken
of
for
increasing
the
revenues
of
the
state
i
laid
too
great
store
by
the
advice
of
the
man
who
had
made
my
fortune
not
to
follow
it
i
went
to
the
comptroller
and
trusting
in
his
probity
i
explained
my
scheme
to
him
this
was
to
pass
a
law
by
which
every
estate
except
that
left
by
father
to
son
should
furnish
the
treasury
with
one
income
every
deed
of
gift
formally
drawn
up
being
subject
to
the
same
provision
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
law
could
not
give
offence
to
anyone
the
heir
had
only
to
imagine
that
he
had
inherited
a
year
later
than
was
actually
the
case
the
minister
was
of
the
same
opinion
as
myself
told
me
that
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
difficulty
involved
and
assured
me
that
my
fortune
was
made
in
a
week
afterwards
his
place
was
taken
by
de
silhouette
and
when
i
called
on
the
new
minister
he
told
me
coldly
that
when
my
scheme
became
law
he
would
tell
me
it
became
law
two
years
afterwards
and
when
as
the
originator
of
the
scheme
i
attempted
to
get
my
just
reward
they
laughed
in
my
face
shortly
after
the
pope
died
and
he
was
succeeded
by
the
venetian
rezzonico
who
created
my
patron
the
abby
de
bernis
a
cardinal
however
he
had
to
go
into
exile
by
order
of
the
king
two
days
after
his
gracious
majesty
had
presented
him
with
the
red
cap
so
good
a
thing
it
is
to
be
the
friend
of
kings
the
disgrace
of
my
delightful
abbe
left
me
without
a
patron
but
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
so
was
enabled
to
bear
this
misfortune
with
resignation
for
having
undone
all
the
work
of
cardinal
richelieu
for
having
changed
the
old
enmity
between
france
and
austria
into
friendship
for
delivering
italy
from
the
horrors
of
war
which
befell
her
whenever
these
countries
had
a
bone
to
pick
although
he
was
the
first
cardinal
made
by
a
pope
who
had
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
discovering
his
character
merely
because
on
being
asked
he
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
prince
de
soubise
was
not
a
fit
person
to
command
the
french
armies
this
great
ecclesiastic
was
driven
into
exile
the
moment
the
pompadour
heard
of
this
opinion
of
his
she
decreed
his
banishment
a
sentence
which
was
unpopular
with
all
classes
of
society
but
they
consoled
themselves
with
epigrams
and
the
new
cardinal
was
soon
forgotten
such
is
the
character
of
the
french
people
it
cares
neither
for
its
own
misfortunes
nor
for
those
of
others
if
only
it
can
extract
laughter
from
them
in
my
time
epigrammatists
and
poetasters
who
assailed
ministers
or
even
the
king
mistresses
were
sent
to
the
bastille
but
the
wits
still
persisted
in
being
amusing
and
there
were
some
who
considered
a
jest
incomplete
that
was
not
followed
by
a
prosecution
a
man
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
a
great
lover
of
notoriety
appropriated
the
following
verses
by
the
younger
crebellon
and
went
to
the
bastille
rather
than
disown

these
but
that
it
was

the
prisoner
had
been
inspired
with
precisely
the
same
ideas
this
jest
was
applauded
and
the
author
of

was
let
alone
cardinal
de
bernis
passed
ten
years
in
exile
negotiis
but
he
was
not
happy
as
he
told
me
himself
when
i
knew
him
in
rome
fifteen
years
afterwards
it
is
said
that
it
is
better
to
be
a
minister
than
a
king
an
opinion
which
seems
ridiculous
when
it
is
analyzed
the
question
is
which
is
the
better
independence
or
its
contrary
the
axiom
may
possibly
be
verified
in
a
despotic
government
under
an
absurd
weak
or
careless
king
who
serves
as
a
mere
mask
for
his
master
the
minister
but
in
all
other
cases
it
is
an
absurdity
cardinal
de
bernis
was
never
recalled
there
is
no
instance
of
louis
xv
having
ever
recalled
a
minister
whom
he
had
disgraced
but
on
the
death
of
rezzonico
he
had
to
go
to
rome
to
be
present
at
the
conclave
and
there
he
remained
as
french
ambassador
about
this
time
madame
conceived
a
wish
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
rousseau
and
we
went
to
call
upon
him
at
montmorenci
on
the
pretext
of
giving
him
music
to
copy
an
occupation
in
which
he
was
very
skilled
he
was
paid
twice
the
sum
given
to
any
other
copyist
but
he
guaranteed
that
the
work
should
be
faultlessly
done
at
that
period
of
his
life
copying
music
was
the
great
writer
sole
means
of
subsistence
we
found
him
to
be
a
man
of
a
simple
and
modest
demeanour
who
talked
well
but
who
was
not
otherwise
distinguished
either
intellectually
or
physically
we
did
not
think
him
what
would
be
called
a
man
and
as
he
was
far
from
having
the
manners
of
good
society
madame
did
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
him
vulgar
we
saw
the
woman
with
whom
he
lived
and
of
whom
we
had
heard
but
she
scarcely
looked
at
us
on
our
way
home
we
amused
ourselves
by
talking
about
rousseau
eccentric
habits
i
will
here
note
down
the
visit
of
the
prince
of
conti
father
of
the
gentleman
who
is
now
known
as
the
comte
de
la
march
to
rousseau
the
prince
a
by
himself
to
montmorenci
on
purpose
to
spend
a
day
in
conversation
with
the
philosopher
who
was
even
then
famous
he
found
him
in
the
park
accosted
him
and
said
that
he
had
come
to
dine
with
him
and
to
talk
without
restraint
your
highness
will
fare
but
badly
said
rousseau
however
i
will
tell
them
to
lay
another
knife
and
fork
the
philosopher
gave
his
instructions
and
came
out
and
rejoined
the
prince
with
whom
he
walked
up
and
down
for
two
or
three
hours
when
it
was
he
took
the
prince
into
his
where
the
table
was
laid
for
three
who
is
going
to
dine
with
us
said
the
prince
i
thought
we
were
to
be
alone
the
third
party
said
rousseau
is
my
other
self
a
being
who
is
neither
my
wife
nor
my
mistress
nor
my
nor
my
mother
nor
my
daughter
but
yet
personates
all
these
characters
at
once
i
daresay
my
dear
fellow
i
daresay
but
as
i
came
to
dine
with
you
alone
i
will
not
dine
with
your
other
self
but
will
leave
you
with
all
the
rest
of
you
to
keep
your
company
so
saying
the
prince
bade
him
farewell
and
went
out
rousseau
did
not
try
to
keep
him
about
this
time
i
witnessed
the
failure
of
a
play
called
daughter
written
by
the
ingenious
madame
de
graffini
who
died
of
vexation
five
days
after
her
play
was
damned
the
abbe
de
voisenon
was
horrified
as
he
had
advised
the
lady
to
produce
it
and
was
thought
to
have
had
some
hand
in
its
composition
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
peruviennes
and
by
a
curious
coincidence
just
about
the
same
date
rezzonico
mother
died
of
joy
because
her
son
had
become
pope
grief
and
joy
kill
many
more
women
than
men
which
proves
that
if
women
have
mere
feeling
than
men
they
have
also
less
strength
when
madame
thought
that
my
adopted
son
was
comfortably
settled
in
viar
house
she
made
me
go
with
her
and
pay
him
a
visit
i
found
him
lodged
like
a
prince
well
dressed
made
much
of
and
almost
looked
up
to
i
was
astonished
for
this
was
more
than
i
had
bargained
for
madame
had
given
him
masters
of
all
sorts
and
a
pretty
little
pony
for
him
to
learn
riding
on
he
was
styled
le
comte
a
girl
of
sixteen
viar
daughter
a
young
woman
was
appointed
to
look
after
him
and
she
was
quite
proud
to
call
herself
my
governess
she
assured
madame
that
she
took
special
care
of
him
that
as
soon
as
he
woke
she
brought
him
his
breakfast
in
bed
that
she
then
dressed
him
and
did
not
leave
his
side
the
whole
day
madame
approved
of
everything
told
the
girl
to
take
even
greater
care
of
the
count
and
promised
that
she
should
not
go
unrewarded
as
for
the
young
gentleman
he
was
evidently
quite
happy
as
he
told
me
himself
again
and
again
but
i
suspected
a
mystery
somewhere
and
determined
that
i
would
go
and
see
him
by
myself
another
time
and
solve
it
on
our
journey
home
i
told
madame
how
grateful
i
was
for
all
her
goodness
to
the
boy
and
that
i
approved
of
all
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
with
the
exception
of
the
name
aranda
which
said
i
may
some
day
prove
a
thorn
in
his
side
she
answered
that
the
lad
had
said
enough
to
convince
her
that
he
had
a
right
to
bear
that
name
i
had
she
said
in
my
desk
a
seal
with
the
arms
of
the
house
of
aranda
and
happening
to
take
it
up
i
shewed
it
him
as
we
shew
trinkets
to
children
to
amuse
them
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
he
burst
out
came
you
to
have
my
arms
your
arms
i
answered
i
got
this
seal
from
the
comte
how
can
you
prove
that
you
are
a
scion
of
that
race
not
ask
me
madam
my
birth
is
a
secret
i
can
reveal
to
no
one
the
imposition
and
above
all
the
impudence
of
the
young
knave
astounded
me
i
should
not
have
thought
him
capable
of
it
and
a
week
after
i
went
to
see
him
by
myself
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
mystery
i
found
my
young
count
with
viar
who
judging
by
the
awe
the
child
shewed
of
me
must
have
thought
he
belonged
to
me
he
was
unsparing
in
his
praises
of
his
pupil
saying
that
he
played
the
flute
capitally
danced
and
fenced
admirably
rode
well
and
wrote
a
good
hand
he
shewed
me
the
pens
he
had
cut
himself
with
three
five
and
even
nine
points
and
begged
to
be
examined
on
heraldry
which
as
the
master
observed
was
so
necessary
a
science
for
a
young
nobleman
the
young
gentleman
then
commenced
in
the
jargon
of
heraldry
to
blazon
his
own
pretended
arms
and
i
felt
much
inclined
to
burst
into
laughter
partly
because
i
did
not
understand
a
word
he
said
and
partly
because
he
seemed
to
think
the
matter
as
important
as
would
a
country
squire
with
his
quarters
however
i
was
delighted
to
see
his
dexterity
in
penmanship
which
was
undoubtedly
very
great
and
i
expressed
my
satisfaction
to
viar
who
soon
left
us
to
ourselves
we
proceeded
into
the
garden
will
you
kindly
inform
me
i
said
how
you
can
be
so
foolish
as
to
call
yourself
the
comte
he
replied
with
the
utmost
calmness
i
know
it
is
foolish
but
leave
me
my
title
it
is
of
service
to
me
here
and
gains
me
respect
it
is
an
imposition
i
can
not
wink
at
as
it
may
be
fraught
with
serious
results
and
may
do
harm
to
both
of
us
i
should
not
have
thought
that
at
your
age
you
would
be
capable
of
such
a
knavish
trick
i
know
you
did
it
out
of
stupidity
but
after
a
certain
limit
stupidity
becomes
criminal
and
i
can
not
see
how
i
am
to
remedy
your
fault
without
disgracing
you
in
the
eyes
of
madame
i
kept
on
scolding
him
till
he
burst
into
tears
saying
i
had
rather
the
shame
of
being
sent
back
to
my
mother
than
the
shame
of
confessing
to
madame
that
i
had
imposed
on
her
and
i
could
not
bear
to
stay
here
if
i
had
to
give
up
my
name
seeing
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
him
unless
indeed
i
sent
him
to
some
place
far
removed
from
paris
under
his
proper
name
i
told
him
to
take
comfort
as
i
would
try
and
do
the
best
i
could
for
both
of
us
and
now
tell
me
and
take
care
to
tell
the
truth
what
sort
of
feelings
does
viar
daughter
entertain
for
you
i
think
papa
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
reserve
commended
by
yourself
as
well
as
by
mother
would
be
appropriate
yes
that
sort
of
answer
tells
me
a
good
deal
but
i
think
you
are
rather
too
knowing
for
your
age
and
you
may
as
well
observe
that
when
you
are
called
upon
for
a
confession
reserve
is
out
of
place
and
it
a
confession
i
require
from
you
well
papa
viar
daughter
is
very
fond
of
me
and
she
shews
her
love
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
do
you
love
her
oh
yes
is
she
much
with
you
in
the
morning
she
is
with
me
the
whole
day
she
is
present
when
you
go
to
bed
yes
she
helps
me
to
undress
nothing
else
i
do
not
care
to
tell
you
i
was
astonished
at
the
measured
way
in
which
he
answered
me
and
as
i
had
heard
enough
to
guess
that
the
boy
and
girl
were
very
good
friends
indeed
i
contented
myself
with
warning
him
to
take
care
of
his
health
and
with
this
i
left
him
some
time
after
my
thoughts
were
occupied
with
a
business
speculation
which
all
my
calculations
assured
me
would
be
extremely
profitable
the
plan
was
to
produce
on
silks
by
means
of
printing
the
exquisite
designs
which
are
produced
at
lyons
by
the
tedious
process
of
weaving
and
thus
to
give
customers
excellent
value
at
much
lower
prices
i
had
the
requisite
knowledge
of
chemistry
and
enough
capital
to
make
the
thing
a
success
i
obtained
the
assistance
of
a
man
with
the
necessary
technical
skill
and
knowledge
intending
to
make
him
my
manager
i
told
my
plan
to
the
prince
de
conti
who
encouraged
me
to
persevere
promising
me
his
patronage
and
all
the
privileges
i
could
wish
for
that
decided
me
to
begin
i
rented
a
very
large
house
near
the
temple
for
a
thousand
crowns
per
annum
the
house
contained
a
spacious
hall
in
which
i
meant
to
put
my
workmen
another
hall
which
was
to
be
the
shop
numerous
rooms
for
my
workpeople
to
live
in
and
a
nice
room
for
myself
in
case
i
cared
to
live
on
the
premises
i
made
the
scheme
into
a
company
with
thirty
shares
of
which
i
gave
five
to
my
designer
keeping
the
remaining
to
distribute
to
those
who
were
inclined
to
join
the
company
i
gave
one
to
a
doctor
who
on
giving
surety
became
the
storekeeper
and
came
to
live
in
the
house
with
his
whole
family
and
i
engaged
four
servants
a
and
a
porter
i
had
to
give
another
share
to
an
accountant
who
furnished
me
with
two
clerks
who
also
took
up
their
abode
in
the
house
the
carpenters
blacksmiths
and
painters
worked
hard
from
morning
to
night
and
in
less
than
three
weeks
the
place
was
ready
i
told
the
manager
to
engage
twenty
girls
to
paint
who
were
to
be
paid
every
saturday
i
stocked
the
warehouse
with
three
hundred
pieces
of
sarcenet
and
camlet
of
different
shades
and
colours
to
receive
the
designs
and
i
paid
for
everything
in
ready
money
i
had
made
an
approximate
calculation
with
my
manager
that
i
should
have
to
spend
three
hundred
thousand
francs
and
that
would
not
break
me
if
the
worst
happened
i
could
fall
back
on
my
shares
which
produced
a
good
income
but
i
hoped
i
should
not
be
compelled
to
do
so
as
i
wanted
to
have
an
income
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
all
the
while
i
did
not
conceal
from
myself
that
the
speculation
might
be
my
ruin
if
custom
did
not
come
in
but
on
looking
at
my
beautiful
materials
these
fears
were
dispelled
especially
as
i
heard
everybody
saying
that
i
sold
them
much
too
cheap
to
set
up
the
business
i
spent
in
the
course
of
a
month
about
sixty
thousand
francs
and
my
weekly
expenses
amounted
to
twelve
hundred
francs
as
for
madame
she
laughed
every
time
she
saw
me
for
she
was
quite
certain
that
this
business
was
only
meant
to
put
the
curious
off
the
scent
and
to
preserve
my
incognito
so
persuaded
was
she
of
my
omnipotence
the
sight
of
twenty
girls
all
more
or
less
pretty
the
eldest
of
whom
was
not
far
from
making
me
tremble
as
it
ought
delighted
me
i
fancied
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
seraglio
and
i
amused
myself
by
watching
their
meek
and
modest
looks
as
they
did
their
work
under
the
direction
of
the
foreman
the
best
paid
did
not
get
more
than
sous
a
day
and
all
of
them
had
excellent
reputations
for
they
had
been
selected
at
her
own
request
by
the
manager
wife
a
devout
woman
of
ripe
age
whom
i
hoped
to
find
obliging
if
the
fancy
seized
me
to
test
her
choice
manon
baletti
did
not
share
my
satisfaction
in
them
she
trembled
to
see
me
the
owner
of
a
harem
well
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
the
barque
of
my
virtue
would
run
on
the
rocks
she
scolded
me
well
about
these
girls
though
i
assured
her
that
none
of
them
slept
in
the
house
this
business
increased
my
own
ideas
of
my
importance
partly
from
the
thought
that
i
was
on
the
high
road
to
fortune
and
partly
because
i
furnished
so
many
people
with
the
means
of
subsistence
alas
i
was
too
fortunate
and
my
evil
genius
soon
crossed
my
career
it
was
now
three
months
since
mdlle
had
gone
into
the
convent
and
the
time
of
her
delivery
drew
near
we
wrote
to
each
other
twice
a
week
and
i
considered
the
matter
happily
settled
de
la
popeliniere
had
married
and
when
mdlle
returned
to
her
mother
there
would
be
nothing
more
to
be
said
but
just
at
this
period
when
my
happiness
seemed
assured
the
hidden
fire
leapt
forth
and
threatened
to
consume
me
how
the
reader
will
see
one
day
after
leaving
madame
i
went
to
walk
in
the
tuileries
i
had
taken
a
couple
of
turns
in
the
chief
walk
when
i
saw
that
an
old
woman
accompanied
by
a
man
dressed
in
black
was
looking
at
me
closely
and
communicating
her
observations
to
her
companion
there
was
nothing
very
astonishing
in
this
in
a
public
place
and
i
continued
my
walk
and
on
turning
again
saw
the
same
couple
still
watching
me
in
my
turn
i
looked
at
them
and
remembered
seeing
the
man
in
a
where
he
was
known
by
the
name
of
on
scrutinizing
the
features
of
the
hag
i
at
last
succeeded
in
recollecting
who
she
was
she
was
the
woman
to
whom
i
had
taken
mdlle
i
felt
certain
that
she
had
recognized
me
but
not
troubling
myself
about
the
matter
i
left
the
gardens
to
walk
elsewhere
the
day
after
next
just
as
i
was
going
to
get
into
my
carriage
a
man
of
evil
aspect
gave
me
a
paper
and
asked
me
to
read
it
i
opened
it
but
finding
it
covered
with
an
illegible
scrawl
i
gave
it
him
back
telling
him
to
read
it
himself
he
did
so
and
i
found
myself
summoned
to
appear
before
the
commissary
of
police
to
answer
to
the
plea
which
the
midwife
whose
name
i
forget
brought
against
me
although
i
could
guess
what
the
charge
would
be
and
was
certain
that
the
midwife
could
furnish
no
proofs
of
her
accusation
i
went
to
an
attorney
i
knew
and
told
him
to
appear
for
me
i
instructed
him
that
i
did
not
know
any
midwife
in
paris
whatsoever
the
attorney
waited
on
the
commissary
and
on
the
day
after
brought
me
a
copy
of
the
pleas
the
midwife
said
that
i
came
to
her
one
night
accompanied
by
a
young
lady
about
five
months
with
child
and
that
holding
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
packet
of
fifty
louis
in
the
other
i
made
her
promise
to
procure
abortion
we
both
of
us
so
she
said
had
masks
on
thus
shewing
that
we
had
been
at
the
opera
ball
fear
said
she
had
prevented
her
from
flatly
refusing
to
grant
my
request
but
she
had
enough
presence
of
mind
to
say
that
the
necessary
drugs
were
not
ready
that
she
would
have
all
in
order
by
the
next
night
whereupon
we
left
promising
to
return
in
the
belief
that
we
would
not
fail
to
keep
the
appointment
she
went
in
to
to
ask
him
to
hide
in
the
next
room
that
she
might
be
protected
from
my
fury
and
that
he
might
be
a
witness
of
what
i
said
but
she
had
not
seen
me
again
she
added
that
she
would
have
given
information
the
day
after
the
event
if
she
had
known
who
i
was
but
since
had
told
her
my
name
on
her
recognizing
me
in
the
tuileries
she
had
thought
it
her
bounden
duty
to
deliver
me
to
the
law
that
she
might
be
compensated
for
the
violence
i
had
used
to
her
and
this
document
was
signed
by
the
said
as
a
witness
this
is
an
evident
case
of
libel
said
my
attorney
at
least
if
she
ca
prove
the
truth
of
her
allegations
my
advice
to
you
is
to
take
the
matter
before
the
criminal
lieutenant
who
will
be
able
to
give
you
the
satisfaction
you
require
i
authorized
him
to
do
what
he
thought
advisable
and
three
or
four
days
after
he
told
me
that
the
lieutenant
wished
to
speak
to
me
in
private
and
would
expect
me
the
same
day
at
three
in
the
afternoon
as
will
be
expected
i
was
punctual
to
the
appointment
i
found
the
magistrate
to
be
a
polite
and
gentleman
he
was
in
fact
the
de
sartine
who
was
the
chief
of
police
two
years
later
his
office
of
criminal
lieutenant
was
saleable
and
de
sartine
sold
it
when
he
was
appointed
head
of
the
police
as
soon
as
i
had
made
my
bow
he
asked
me
to
sit
down
by
him
and
addressed
me
as
follows
i
have
asked
you
to
call
upon
me
in
the
interests
of
both
of
us
as
in
your
position
our
interests
are
inseparable
if
you
are
innocent
of
the
charge
which
has
been
brought
against
you
you
are
quite
right
to
appeal
to
me
but
before
proceedings
begin
you
should
tell
me
the
whole
truth
i
am
ready
to
forget
my
position
as
judge
and
to
give
you
my
help
but
you
must
see
yourself
that
to
prove
the
other
side
guilty
of
slander
you
must
prove
yourself
innocent
what
i
want
from
you
is
an
informal
and
strictly
confidential
declaration
for
the
case
against
you
is
a
serious
one
and
of
such
a
kind
as
to
require
all
your
efforts
to
wipe
off
this
blot
upon
your
honour
your
enemies
will
not
respect
your
delicacy
of
feeling
they
will
press
you
so
hard
that
you
will
either
be
obliged
to
submit
to
a
shameful
sentence
or
to
wound
your
feelings
of
honour
in
proving
your
innocence
you
see
i
am
confiding
in
you
for
in
certain
cases
honour
seems
so
precious
a
thing
to
me
that
i
am
ready
to
defend
it
with
all
the
power
of
the
law
pay
me
back
then
in
the
same
coin
trust
in
me
entirely
tell
me
the
whole
story
without
any
reserves
and
you
may
rely
upon
my
good
offices
all
will
be
well
if
you
are
innocent
for
i
shall
not
be
the
less
a
judge
because
i
am
your
friend
but
if
you
are
guilty
i
am
sorry
for
you
for
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
be
just
after
doing
my
best
to
express
my
gratitude
to
him
i
said
that
my
position
did
not
oblige
me
to
make
any
reservations
on
account
of
honour
and
that
i
had
consequently
no
informal
statement
to
make
him
the
midwife
i
added
is
absolutely
unknown
to
me
she
is
most
likely
an
abandoned
woman
who
with
her
worthy
companion
wants
to
cheat
me
of
my
money
i
should
be
delighted
to
think
so
he
answered
but
admitting
the
fact
see
how
chance
favours
her
and
makes
it
a
most
difficult
thing
for
you
to
prove
your
innocence
the
young
lady
disappeared
three
months
ago
she
was
known
to
be
your
intimate
friend
you
called
upon
her
at
all
hours
you
spent
a
considerable
time
with
her
the
day
before
she
disappeared
and
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
her
but
everyone
suspicions
point
at
you
and
paid
spies
are
continually
dogging
your
steps
the
midwife
sent
me
a
requisition
yesterday
by
her
counsel
vauversin
she
says
that
the
pregnant
lady
you
brought
to
her
house
is
the
same
whom
madame
is
searching
for
she
also
says
that
you
both
wore
black
dominoes
and
the
police
have
ascertained
that
you
were
both
at
the
ball
in
black
dominoes
on
the
same
night
as
that
on
which
the
midwife
says
you
came
to
her
house
you
are
also
known
to
have
left
the
together
all
this
it
is
true
does
not
constitute
full
proof
of
your
guilt
but
it
makes
one
tremble
for
your
innocence
what
cause
have
i
to
tremble
what
cause
why
a
false
witness
easily
enough
hired
for
a
little
money
might
swear
with
impunity
that
he
saw
you
come
from
the
opera
together
and
a
coachman
in
the
same
way
might
swear
he
had
taken
you
to
the
midwife
in
that
case
i
should
be
compelled
to
order
your
arrest
and
examination
with
a
view
to
ascertain
the
name
of
the
person
whom
you
took
with
you
do
you
realize
that
you
are
accused
of
procuring
abortion
that
three
months
have
gone
by
without
the
lady
retreat
having
been
discovered
that
she
is
said
to
be
dead
do
you
realize
in
short
what
a
very
serious
charge
murder
is
certainly
but
if
i
die
innocent
you
will
have
condemned
me
wrongly
and
will
be
more
to
be
pitied
than
i
yes
yes
but
that
would
make
your
case
any
better
you
may
be
sure
however
that
i
will
not
condemn
an
innocent
man
but
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
be
a
long
time
in
prison
before
you
succeed
in
proving
your
innocence
to
be
brief
you
see
that
in
hours
the
case
looks
very
bad
and
in
the
course
of
a
week
it
might
look
very
much
worse
my
interest
was
aroused
in
your
favour
by
the
evident
absurdity
of
the
accusations
but
it
is
the
other
circumstances
about
the
case
which
make
it
a
serious
one
for
you
i
can
partly
understand
the
circumstances
and
the
feelings
of
love
and
honour
which
bid
you
be
silent
i
have
spoken
to
you
and
i
hope
you
will
have
no
reserves
with
me
i
will
spare
you
all
the
unpleasant
circumstances
which
threaten
you
believing
as
i
do
that
you
are
innocent
tell
me
all
and
be
sure
that
the
lady
honour
will
not
suffer
but
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
unfortunately
guilty
of
the
crimes
laid
to
your
charge
i
advise
you
to
be
prudent
and
to
take
steps
which
it
is
not
my
business
to
suggest
i
warn
you
that
in
three
or
four
days
i
shall
cite
you
to
the
bar
of
the
court
and
that
you
will
then
find
in
me
only
the
judge
just
certainly
but
severe
and
impartial
i
was
petrified
for
these
words
shewed
me
my
danger
in
all
its
nakedness
i
saw
how
i
should
esteem
this
worthy
man
good
offices
and
said
to
him
in
quite
another
tone
that
innocent
as
i
was
i
saw
that
my
best
course
was
to
throw
myself
on
his
kindness
respecting
mdlle
who
had
committed
no
crime
but
would
lose
her
reputation
by
this
unhappy
business
i
know
where
she
is
i
added
and
i
may
tell
you
that
she
would
never
have
left
her
mother
if
she
had
not
endeavoured
to
force
her
into
a
marriage
she
abhorred
well
but
the
man
is
now
married
let
her
return
to
her
mother
house
and
you
will
be
safe
unless
the
midwife
persists
in
maintaining
that
you
incited
her
to
procure
abortion
there
is
no
abortion
in
the
matter
but
other
reasons
prevent
her
returning
to
her
family
i
can
tell
you
no
more
without
obtaining
the
consent
of
another
party
if
i
succeed
in
doing
so
i
shall
be
able
to
throw
the
desired
light
on
the
question
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
second
hearing
on
the
day
after
i
understand
i
shall
be
delighted
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
i
thank
and
congratulate
you
farewell
i
was
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
but
i
was
determined
to
leave
the
kingdom
rather
than
betray
the
honour
of
my
poor
dear
sweetheart
if
it
had
been
possible
i
would
gladly
have
put
an
end
to
the
case
with
money
but
it
was
too
late
i
was
sure
that
farsetti
had
the
chief
hand
in
all
this
trouble
that
he
was
continually
on
my
track
and
that
he
paid
the
spies
mentioned
by
de
sartine
he
it
was
who
had
set
vauversin
the
barrister
after
me
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
ruin
me
i
felt
that
my
only
course
was
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
de
sartine
but
to
do
that
i
required
madame
du
rumain
permission

at

to
holland
helvetius
esprit
piccolomini
the
day
after
my
interview
with
de
sartine
i
waited
on
madame
du
rumain
at
an
early
hour
considering
the
urgency
of
the
case
i
took
the
liberty
of
rousing
her
from
her
slumbers
and
as
soon
as
she
was
ready
to
receive
me
i
told
her
all
there
can
be
no
hesitation
in
the
matter
said
this
delightful
woman
we
must
make
a
confidant
of
de
sartine
and
i
will
speak
to
him
myself
without
fail
forthwith
she
went
to
her
desk
and
wrote
to
the
criminal
lieutenant
asking
him
to
see
her
at
three
in
the
afternoon
in
less
than
an
hour
the
servant
returned
with
a
note
in
which
he
said
he
would
expect
her
we
agreed
that
i
should
come
again
in
the
evening
when
she
would
tell
me
the
result
of
her
interview
i
went
to
the
house
at
five
and
had
only
a
few
minutes
to
wait
i
have
concealed
nothing
said
she
he
knows
that
she
is
on
the
eve
of
her
confinement
and
that
you
are
not
the
father
which
speaks
highly
for
your
generosity
i
told
him
that
as
soon
as
the
confinement
was
over
and
the
young
lady
had
recovered
her
health
she
would
return
to
her
mother
though
she
would
make
no
confession
and
that
the
child
should
be
well
looked
after
you
have
now
nothing
to
fear
and
can
calm
yourself
but
as
the
case
must
go
on
you
will
be
cited
before
the
court
the
day
after
i
advise
you
to
see
the
clerk
of
the
court
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
to
make
him
accept
a
sum
of
money
i
was
summoned
to
appear
and
i
appeared
i
saw
de
sartine
pro
tribunali
at
the
end
of
the
sitting
he
told
me
that
he
was
obliged
to
remand
me
and
that
during
my
remand
i
must
not
leave
paris
or
get
married
as
all
my
civil
rights
were
in
suspense
pending
the
decision
i
promised
to
follow
his
commands
i
acknowledged
in
my
examination
that
i
was
at
the
ball
in
a
black
domino
on
the
night
named
in
my
accusation
but
i
denied
everything
else
as
for
mdlle
i
said
that
neither
i
nor
anyone
of
her
family
had
any
suspicion
that
she
was
with
child
recollecting
that
i
was
an
alien
and
that
this
circumstance
might
make
vauversin
call
for
my
arrest
on
the
plea
that
i
might
fly
the
kingdom
i
thought
the
moment
opportune
for
making
interest
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
i
accordingly
paid
him
a
visit
after
telling
him
of
my
fears
i
slipped
into
his
hand
a
packet
of
three
hundred
louis
for
which
i
did
not
ask
for
a
receipt
saying
that
they
were
to
defray
expenses
if
i
were
mulcted
in
costs
he
advised
me
to
require
the
midwife
to
give
bail
for
her
appearance
and
i
told
my
attorney
to
do
so
but
four
days
after
the
following
incident
took
place
i
was
walking
in
the
temple
gardens
when
i
was
accosted
by
a
savoyard
who
gave
me
a
note
in
which
i
was
informed
that
somebody
in
an
alley
fifty
paces
off
wanted
to
speak
to
me
either
a
love
affair
or
a
challenge
i
said
to
myself
let
see
i
stopped
my
carriage
which
was
following
me
and
went
to
the
place
i
can
not
say
how
surprised
i
was
to
see
the
wretched
standing
before
me
i
have
only
a
word
to
say
said
he
when
he
saw
me
we
will
not
be
overheard
here
the
midwife
is
quite
sure
that
you
are
the
man
who
brought
a
pregnant
lady
to
her
but
she
is
vexed
that
you
are
accused
of
making
away
with
her
give
her
a
hundred
louis
she
will
then
declare
to
the
court
that
she
has
been
mistaken
and
your
trouble
will
be
ended
you
need
not
pay
the
money
till
she
has
made
her
declaration
we
will
take
your
word
for
it
come
with
me
and
talk
it
over
with
vauversin
i
am
sure
he
will
persuade
you
to
do
as
i
suggest
i
know
where
to
find
him
follow
me
at
some
distance
i
had
listened
to
him
in
silence
and
i
was
delighted
to
see
that
the
rascals
were
betraying
themselves
very
good
said
i
to
the
fellow
you
go
on
and
i
will
follow
i
went
after
him
to
the
third
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
aux
ours
where
i
found
vauversin
the
barrister
no
sooner
had
i
arrived
than
he
went
to
business
without
any
prefatory
remarks
the
midwife
he
said
will
call
on
you
with
a
witness
apparently
with
the
intention
of
maintaining
to
your
face
that
you
are
her
man
but
she
wo
be
able
to
recognize
you
she
will
then
proceed
with
the
witness
to
the
court
and
will
declare
that
she
has
made
a
mistake
and
the
criminal
lieutenant
will
forthwith
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
you
will
thus
be
certain
of
gaining
your
case
against
the
lady
mother
i
thought
the
plan
well
conceived
and
said
that
they
would
find
me
at
the
temple
any
day
up
to
noon
but
the
midwife
wants
a
hundred
louis
badly
you
mean
that
the
worthy
woman
rates
her
perjury
at
that
price
well
never
mind
i
will
pay
the
money
and
you
may
trust
to
my
word
but
i
ca
do
so
before
she
has
taken
oath
to
her
mistake
before
the
court
very
good
but
you
must
first
give
me
louis
to
reimburse
me
for
my
costs
and
fees
certainly
if
you
will
give
me
a
formal
receipt
for
the
money
he
hesitated
at
first
but
after
talking
it
over
the
money
proved
too
strong
a
bait
and
he
wrote
out
the
receipt
and
i
gave
him
the
louis
he
thanked
me
and
said
that
though
madame
was
his
client
he
would
let
me
know
confidentially
how
best
to
put
a
stop
to
the
proceedings
i
thanked
him
with
as
much
gratitude
as
if
i
had
really
intended
to
make
use
of
his
services
and
i
left
to
write
and
tell
de
sartine
what
had
taken
place
three
days
afterwards
i
was
told
that
a
man
and
woman
wanted
to
see
me
i
went
down
and
asked
the
woman
what
she
wanted
i
want
to
speak
to
m
casanova
i
am
he
then
i
have
made
a
mistake
for
which
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
her
companion
smiled
and
they
went
off
the
same
day
madame
du
rumain
had
a
letter
from
the
abbess
telling
her
that
her
young
friend
had
given
birth
to
a
fine
boy
who
had
been
sent
away
to
a
place
where
he
would
be
well
looked
after
she
stated
that
the
young
lady
could
not
leave
the
convent
for
the
next
six
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
time
she
could
return
to
her
mother
with
a
certificate
which
would
protect
her
from
all
annoyance
soon
after
the
midwife
was
put
in
solitary
confinement
was
sent
to
the
bicetre
and
vauversin
name
was
struck
off
the
rolls
the
suit
instituted
against
me
by
madame
went
on
till
her
daughter
reappeared
but
i
knew
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
the
girl
returned
to
her
mother
about
the
end
of
august
armed
with
a
certificate
from
the
abbess
who
said
she
had
been
under
her
protection
for
four
months
during
which
time
she
had
never
left
the
convent
or
seen
any
persons
from
outside
this
was
perfectly
true
but
the
abbess
added
that
her
only
reason
for
her
going
back
to
her
family
was
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
dread
from
the
attentions
of
de
la
popeliniere
and
in
this
the
abbess
lied
mdlle
profited
by
the
delight
of
her
mother
in
seeing
her
again
safe
and
sound
and
made
her
wait
on
de
sartine
with
the
certificate
stop
all
proceedings
against
me
and
withdraw
all
the
charges
she
had
made
her
daughter
told
her
that
if
i
liked
i
might
claim
damages
for
libel
and
that
if
she
did
not
wish
to
injure
her
reputation
she
would
say
nothing
more
about
what
had
happened
the
mother
wrote
me
a
letter
of
the
most
satisfactory
character
which
i
had
registered
in
court
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
prosecution
in
my
turn
i
wrote
to
congratulate
her
on
the
recovery
of
her
daughter
but
i
never
set
foot
in
her
house
again
to
avoid
any
disagreeable
scenes
with
farsetti
mdlle
could
not
stay
any
longer
in
paris
where
her
tale
was
known
to
everyone
and
farsetti
took
her
to
brussels
with
her
sister
madelaine
some
time
after
her
mother
followed
her
and
they
then
went
on
to
venice
and
there
in
three
years
time
she
became
a
great
lady
fifteen
years
afterwards
i
saw
her
again
and
she
was
a
widow
happy
enough
apparently
and
enjoying
a
great
reputation
on
account
of
her
rank
wit
and
social
qualities
but
our
connection
was
never
renewed
in
four
years
the
reader
will
hear
more
of
towards
the
end
of
the
same
year
before
i
went
to
holland
i
spent
several
hundred
francs
to
obtain
the
release
of
the
midwife
i
lived
like
a
prince
and
men
might
have
thought
me
happy
but
i
was
not
the
enormous
expenses
i
incurred
my
love
of
spending
money
and
magnificent
pleasures
warned
me
in
spite
of
myself
that
there
were
rocks
ahead
my
business
would
have
kept
me
going
for
a
long
time
if
custom
had
not
been
paralyzed
by
the
war
but
as
it
was
i
like
everybody
else
experienced
the
effect
of
bad
times
my
warehouse
contained
four
hundred
pieces
of
stuffs
with
designs
on
them
but
as
i
could
not
hope
to
dispose
of
them
before
the
peace
and
as
peace
seemed
a
long
way
off
i
was
threatened
with
ruin
with
this
fear
i
wrote
to
esther
to
get
her
father
to
give
me
the
remainder
of
my
money
to
send
me
a
sharp
clerk
and
to
join
in
my
speculation
said
that
if
i
would
set
up
in
holland
he
would
become
responsible
for
everything
and
give
me
half
profits
but
i
liked
paris
too
well
to
agree
to
so
good
an
offer
i
was
sorry
for
it
afterwards
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
at
my
private
house
but
the
chief
expense
of
my
life
which
was
unknown
to
others
but
which
was
ruining
me
was
incurred
in
connection
with
the
girls
who
worked
in
my
establishment
with
my
complexion
and
my
pronounced
liking
for
variety
a
score
of
girls
nearly
all
of
them
pretty
and
seductive
as
most
paris
girls
are
was
a
reef
on
which
my
virtue
made
shipwreck
every
day
curiosity
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
it
and
they
profited
by
my
impatience
to
take
possession
by
selling
their
favours
dearly
they
all
followed
the
example
of
the
first
favourite
and
everyone
claimed
in
turn
an
establishment
furniture
money
and
jewels
and
i
knew
too
little
of
the
value
of
money
to
care
how
much
they
asked
my
fancy
never
lasted
longer
than
a
week
and
often
waned
in
three
or
four
days
and
the
last
comer
always
appeared
the
most
worthy
of
my
attentions
as
soon
as
i
had
made
a
new
choice
i
saw
no
more
of
my
old
loves
but
i
continued
to
provide
for
them
and
that
with
a
good
deal
of
money
madame
who
thought
i
was
rich
gave
me
no
trouble
i
made
her
happy
by
using
my
oracle
to
second
the
magical
ceremonies
of
which
she
grew
fonder
every
day
although
she
never
attained
her
aim
manon
baletti
however
grieved
me
sorely
by
her
jealousy
and
her
reproaches
she
would
not
understand
and
i
did
not
wonder
at
it
how
i
could
put
off
marrying
her
if
i
really
loved
her
she
accused
me
of
deceiving
her
her
mother
died
of
consumption
in
our
arms
silvia
had
won
my
true
friendship
i
looked
upon
her
as
a
most
worthy
woman
whose
kindness
of
heart
and
purity
of
life
deserved
the
esteem
of
all
i
stayed
in
the
family
for
three
days
after
her
death
sincerely
sympathizing
with
them
in
their
affliction
a
few
days
afterwards
my
friend
tiretta
lost
his
mistress
through
a
grievous
illness
four
days
before
her
death
perceiving
that
she
was
near
her
end
she
willed
to
consecrate
to
god
that
which
man
could
have
no
longer
and
dismissed
her
lover
with
the
gift
of
a
valuable
jewel
and
a
purse
of
two
hundred
louis
tiretta
marched
off
and
came
and
told
me
the
sad
news
i
got
him
a
lodging
near
the
temple
and
a
month
after
approving
his
idea
to
try
his
fortune
in
india
i
gave
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
of
amsterdam
and
in
the
course
of
a
week
this
gentleman
got
him
a
post
as
clerk
and
shipped
him
aboard
one
of
the
company
ships
which
was
bound
for
batavia
if
he
had
behaved
well
he
might
have
become
a
rich
man
but
he
got
involved
in
some
conspiracy
and
had
to
fly
and
afterwards
experienced
many
vicissitudes
of
fortune
i
heard
from
one
of
his
relations
that
he
was
in
bengal
in
in
good
circumstances
but
unable
to
realize
his
property
and
so
return
to
his
native
country
i
do
not
know
what
became
of
him
eventually
in
the
beginning
of
november
an
official
belonging
to
the
duc
household
came
to
my
establishment
to
buy
a
wedding
dress
for
his
daughter
i
was
dazzled
with
her
beauty
she
chose
a
fine
satin
and
her
pretty
face
lighted
up
when
she
heard
her
father
say
he
did
not
think
it
was
too
much
but
she
looked
quite
piteous
when
she
heard
the
clerk
tell
her
father
that
he
would
have
to
buy
the
whole
piece
as
they
could
not
cut
it
i
felt
that
i
must
give
in
and
to
avoid
making
an
exception
in
her
favour
i
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
my
private
room
i
wish
i
had
gone
out
of
the
house
as
i
should
have
saved
a
good
deal
of
money
but
what
pleasure
should
i
have
also
lost
in
her
despair
the
charming
girl
begged
the
manager
to
take
her
to
me
and
he
dared
not
refuse
to
do
so
she
came
in
two
big
tears
falling
down
her
cheeks
and
dimming
the
ardour
of
her
gaze
oh
sir
she
began
you
are
rich
do
you
buy
the
piece
and
let
me
have
enough
for
a
dress
which
will
make
me
happy
i
looked
at
her
father
and
saw
he
wore
an
apologetic
air
as
if
deprecating
the
boldness
of
his
child
i
like
your
simplicity
i
said
to
her
and
since
it
will
make
you
happy
you
shall
have
the
dress
she
ran
up
to
me
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
while
her
worthy
father
was
dying
with
laughter
her
kisses
put
the
last
stroke
to
my
bewitchment
after
he
had
paid
for
the
dress
her
father
said
i
am
going
to
get
this
little
madcap
married
next
sunday
there
will
be
a
supper
and
a
ball
and
we
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
honour
us
with
your
presence
my
name
is
gilbert
i
am
comptroller
of
the
duc
household
i
promised
to
be
at
the
wedding
and
the
young
lady
gave
a
skip
of
joy
which
made
me
think
her
prettier
than
ever
on
sunday
i
repaired
to
the
house
but
i
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
the
fair
mdlle
gilbert
kept
me
in
a
kind
of
enchantment
which
lasted
while
i
was
in
company
with
her
friends
for
whom
i
did
not
care
they
were
all
officials
in
noblemen
houses
with
their
wives
and
daughters
who
all
aped
the
manners
of
their
betters
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
nobody
knew
me
and
i
was
known
to
nobody
and
i
cut
a
sorry
figure
amongst
them
all
for
in
a
company
of
this
sort
the
wittiest
man
is
the
greatest
fool
everybody
cracked
his
joke
to
the
bride
she
answered
everybody
and
people
laughed
at
nothing
her
husband
a
thin
and
melancholy
man
with
a
rather
foolish
expression
was
delighted
at
his
wife
keeping
everybody
amused
although
i
was
in
love
with
her
i
pitied
rather
than
envied
him
i
guessed
that
he
had
married
for
monetary
considerations
and
i
knew
pretty
well
what
kind
of
a
his
handsome
fiery
wife
would
give
her
husband
who
was
and
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
his
wife
beauty
i
was
seized
with
the
desire
of
asking
her
some
questions
and
she
gave
me
the
opportunity
by
coming
to
sit
next
to
me
after
a
quadrille
she
thanked
me
again
for
my
kindness
and
said
that
the
beautiful
dress
i
had
supplied
had
won
her
many
compliments
all
the
same
i
said
i
know
you
are
longing
to
take
it
off
i
know
what
love
is
and
how
impatient
it
makes
one
it
very
funny
that
everyone
persists
in
thinking
that
i
am
in
love
though
i
saw
baret
for
the
first
time
only
a
week
ago
before
then
i
was
absolutely
unconscious
of
his
existence
but
why
are
you
getting
married
in
such
a
hurry
without
waiting
till
you
know
him
better
because
my
father
does
everything
in
a
hurry
i
suppose
your
husband
is
a
very
rich
man
no
but
he
may
become
rich
we
are
going
to
open
a
shop
for
silk
stockings
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
honore
and
the
rue
des
prouveres
and
i
hope
that
you
will
deal
with
us
as
we
would
serve
you
with
the
best
i
shall
certainly
do
so
nay
i
will
be
your
first
customer
if
i
have
to
wait
at
the
door
you
are
kind
baret
said
she
to
her
husband
who
was
standing
close
by
this
gentleman
promises
to
be
our
first
customer
the
gentleman
is
very
good
said
the
husband
and
i
am
sure
he
will
be
satisfied
as
my
stockings
are
genuine
silk
next
tuesday
at
i
began
to
dance
attendance
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
prouveres
and
waited
there
till
the
servant
came
out
to
take
down
the
shutters
i
went
in
and
the
girl
asked
me
my
business
i
want
to
buy
some
stockings
was
my
answer
master
and
mistress
are
still
in
bed
so
you
had
better
come
later
on
no
i
will
wait
here
stop
a
minute
said
i
giving
her
six
francs
go
and
get
me
some
coffee
i
will
drink
it
in
the
shop
i
might
go
and
get
you
some
coffee
but
i
am
not
so
silly
as
to
leave
you
in
the
shop
by
yourself
you
are
afraid
i
might
steal
something
well
one
does
hear
of
such
things
being
done
and
i
do
know
you
from
adam
very
good
but
i
shall
stay
here
all
the
same
before
long
baret
came
down
and
scolded
the
poor
girl
for
not
having
told
him
of
my
presence
go
and
tell
my
wife
to
come
said
he
as
he
began
opening
packets
of
stockings
for
me
to
choose
from
he
kept
stockings
vests
and
silk
drawers
and
i
turned
one
packet
over
after
another
looking
at
them
all
and
not
fixing
on
anything
till
i
saw
his
wife
coming
down
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
as
bright
as
a
lily
she
smiled
at
me
in
the
most
seductive
manner
apologized
for
the
disorder
of
her
dress
and
thanked
me
for
keeping
my
word
i
never
break
my
word
i
said
especially
when
such
a
charming
lady
is
concerned
madame
baret
was
seventeen
of
a
moderate
height
and
an
exquisite
figure
without
being
classically
beautiful
a
raphael
could
not
wish
to
depict
a
more
enticing
face
her
eyes
were
large
and
brilliant
her
drooping
eyelids
which
gave
her
so
modest
and
yet
so
voluptuous
an
appearance
the
mouth
her
splendid
teeth
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
complexion
the
pleasing
air
with
which
she
listened
to
what
was
being
said
her
silvery
voice
the
sweetness
and
sparkling
vivacity
of
her
manner
her
lack
of
conceit
or
rather
her
unconsciousness
of
the
power
of
her
fine
everything
about
this
masterpiece
of
nature
made
me
wonder
and
admire
while
she
by
chance
or
vile
monetary
considerations
was
in
the
power
of
baret
who
pale
and
sickly
thought
a
good
deal
more
of
his
stockings
than
of
the
treasure
marriage
had
given
him
a
treasure
of
which
he
was
all
unworthy
since
he
could
not
see
its
beauty
nor
taste
its
sweetness
i
chose
stockings
and
vests
to
the
amount
of
louis
and
i
paid
the
price
without
trying
to
cheapen
them
i
saw
the
face
of
the
fair
shopwoman
light
up
and
i
augured
well
for
my
success
though
i
could
not
expect
to
do
much
while
the
honeymoon
lasted
i
told
the
servant
that
i
would
give
her
six
francs
if
she
would
bring
the
packet
to
my
house
and
so
i
left
them
next
sunday
baret
came
himself
with
my
purchases
i
gave
him
six
francs
to
hand
over
to
his
servant
but
he
hinted
that
he
was
not
too
proud
to
keep
them
himself
i
was
disgusted
at
this
petty
greed
and
at
his
meanness
in
depriving
his
maid
of
the
six
francs
after
having
made
a
good
profit
in
what
he
had
sold
me
but
i
wanted
to
stand
well
with
him
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
find
so
simple
a
way
of
throwing
dust
into
his
eyes
so
while
i
resolved
that
the
servant
should
not
be
a
loser
i
gave
the
husband
a
good
reception
that
i
might
the
better
mould
him
to
my
purpose
i
had
breakfast
brought
to
him
asking
why
he
had
not
brought
his
wife
she
wanted
me
to
take
her
said
he
but
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
offended
not
at
all
i
should
have
been
delighted
i
think
your
wife
a
charming
woman
you
are
very
kind
to
say
so
but
she
young
she
young
i
do
think
that
any
objection
and
if
she
cares
for
the
walk
bring
her
with
you
another
time
he
said
he
should
be
very
pleased
to
do
so
when
i
passed
by
the
shop
in
my
carriage
i
blew
kisses
to
her
with
my
hand
but
i
did
not
stop
as
i
did
not
want
any
more
stockings
indeed
i
should
have
been
bored
with
the
crowd
of
fops
with
which
the
shop
was
always
full
she
began
to
be
a
topic
of
conversation
in
the
town
the
palais
royal
was
full
of
her
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
she
kept
to
herself
as
if
she
had
richer
prey
in
view
that
told
me
that
no
one
possessed
her
so
far
and
i
hoped
that
i
might
be
the
prey
myself
i
was
quite
willing
to
be
captured
some
days
after
she
saw
my
carriage
coming
and
beckoned
to
me
as
i
passed
i
got
out
and
her
husband
with
many
apologies
told
me
that
he
wanted
me
to
be
the
first
to
see
a
new
fashion
in
breeches
he
had
just
got
in
the
breeches
were
and
no
man
of
fashion
would
be
seen
without
them
they
were
things
but
became
a
young
man
as
they
had
to
fit
exactly
i
told
him
to
measure
me
for
six
pairs
offering
to
pay
in
advance
we
have
them
in
all
sizes
said
he
go
up
to
my
wife
room
and
try
some
on
it
was
a
good
opportunity
and
i
accepted
especially
when
i
heard
him
tell
his
wife
to
go
and
help
me
i
went
upstairs
she
following
and
i
began
to
undress
apologizing
for
doing
so
before
her
i
will
fancy
i
am
your
valet
said
she
and
i
will
help
you
i
did
not
make
any
difficulties
and
after
taking
off
my
shoes
i
gave
her
my
breeches
taking
care
however
to
keep
on
my
drawers
lest
her
modesty
should
receive
too
severe
a
shock
this
done
she
took
a
pair
of
breeches
drew
them
on
me
took
them
off
and
tried
on
others
and
all
this
without
any
impropriety
on
either
side
for
i
had
determined
to
behave
with
discretion
till
the
opportunity
came
to
be
indiscreet
she
decided
that
four
pairs
fitted
me
admirably
and
not
wishing
to
contradict
her
i
gave
her
the
sixteen
louis
she
asked
and
told
her
i
should
be
delighted
if
she
would
bring
them
herself
at
any
time
when
she
was
at
leisure
she
came
downstairs
quite
proud
of
her
knowledge
of
business
and
baret
said
that
next
sunday
he
and
his
wife
would
have
the
honour
of
bringing
me
my
purchase
i
shall
be
charmed
baret
said
i
especially
if
you
will
stay
to
dinner
he
answered
that
having
an
important
engagement
for
two
he
could
only
accept
on
the
condition
that
i
would
let
him
go
at
that
time
and
he
would
return
at
about
five
to
fetch
his
wife
i
found
the
plan
vastly
to
my
taste
but
i
knew
how
to
conceal
my
joy
and
i
quietly
said
that
though
i
should
lose
the
pleasure
of
his
society
he
was
free
to
go
when
he
liked
especially
as
i
had
not
to
go
out
myself
before
six
i
looked
forward
to
the
sunday
and
the
tradesman
and
his
wife
did
not
fail
me
as
soon
as
they
arrived
i
told
my
servant
to
say
not
at
home
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
as
i
was
impatient
to
know
what
would
happen
in
the
afternoon
i
had
dinner
served
at
an
early
hour
the
dishes
were
exquisite
and
the
wines
delicious
the
good
man
ate
much
and
drank
deeply
indeed
to
such
an
extent
that
in
common
politeness
i
was
obliged
to
remind
him
that
he
had
an
important
appointment
at
two
his
wits
being
sharpened
with
champagne
the
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
to
tell
his
wife
to
go
home
by
herself
if
he
were
kept
later
than
five
and
i
hastened
to
add
that
i
would
take
her
home
myself
in
my
carriage
he
thanked
me
and
i
soothed
his
uneasiness
about
being
punctual
to
his
appointment
by
telling
him
that
a
coach
was
waiting
and
that
the
fare
had
been
paid
he
went
off
and
i
found
myself
alone
with
my
jewel
whom
i
was
certain
of
possessing
till
six
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
hall
door
shut
on
the
kind
husband
i
said
to
his
wife
you
are
to
be
congratulated
on
having
such
a
kind
husband
with
a
man
like
that
your
happiness
is
assured
it
is
easy
to
say
happiness
but
enjoying
it
is
a
different
thing
my
husband
health
is
so
delicate
that
i
can
only
consider
myself
as
his
nurse
and
then
he
contracted
heavy
debts
to
set
up
in
business
which
oblige
us
to
observe
the
strictest
economy
we
came
here
on
foot
to
save
the
sons
we
could
live
on
the
profits
of
the
business
if
there
were
no
debts
but
as
it
is
everything
goes
to
pay
the
interest
and
our
sales
are
not
large
enough
to
cover
everything
but
you
have
plenty
of
customers
for
whenever
i
pass
i
see
the
shop
full
of
people
these
customers
you
see
are
idlers
crackers
of
bad
jokes
and
profligates
who
come
and
make
my
head
ache
with
their
jests
they
have
not
a
penny
to
bless
themselves
with
and
we
dare
not
let
them
out
of
our
sight
for
fear
of
their
hands
wandering
if
we
had
cared
to
give
them
credit
our
shop
would
have
been
emptied
long
ago
i
am
rude
to
them
in
the
hopes
that
they
may
leave
me
alone
but
it
of
no
use
their
impudence
is
astonishing
when
my
husband
is
in
i
retreat
to
my
room
but
he
is
often
away
and
then
i
am
obliged
to
put
up
with
them
and
the
scarcity
of
money
prevents
us
from
doing
much
business
but
we
are
obliged
to
pay
our
workmen
all
the
same
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
shall
be
obliged
to
dismiss
them
as
we
shall
soon
have
to
meet
several
bills
next
saturday
we
have
got
to
pay
six
hundred
francs
and
we
have
only
got
two
hundred
i
am
surprised
at
your
having
all
this
worry
in
these
early
days
of
your
marriage
i
suppose
your
father
knew
about
your
husband
circumstances
how
about
your
dowry
my
dowry
of
six
thousand
francs
has
served
most
of
it
to
stock
the
shop
and
to
pay
our
debts
we
have
goods
which
would
pay
our
debts
three
times
over
but
in
bad
times
capital
sunk
is
capital
dead
i
am
sorry
to
hear
all
this
as
if
peace
is
not
made
your
situation
will
become
worse
for
as
you
go
on
your
needs
will
become
greater
yes
for
when
my
husband
is
better
we
may
have
children
what
do
you
mean
to
say
his
health
prevents
him
from
making
you
a
mother
i
ca
believe
it
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
a
mother
who
am
still
a
maid
not
that
i
care
much
about
the
matter
i
should
have
believed
it
how
can
a
man
not
in
the
agony
of
death
feel
ill
beside
you
he
must
be
dead
well
he
is
not
exactly
dead
but
he
does
shew
many
signs
of
life
this
piece
of
wit
made
me
laugh
and
under
cover
of
my
applause
i
embraced
her
without
experiencing
much
resistance
the
first
kiss
was
like
an
electric
spark
it
fired
my
imagination
and
i
increased
my
attentions
till
she
became
as
submissive
as
a
lamb
i
will
help
you
dearest
to
meet
the
bill
on
saturday
and
so
saying
i
drew
her
gently
into
a
closet
where
a
soft
divan
formed
a
suitable
altar
for
the
completion
of
an
amorous
sacrifice
i
was
enchanted
to
find
her
submissive
to
my
caresses
and
my
inquisitiveness
but
she
surprised
me
greatly
when
as
i
placed
myself
in
readiness
for
the
consummation
of
the
act
and
was
already
in
the
proper
posture
between
the
two
columns
she
moved
in
such
a
way
as
to
hinder
my
advance
i
thought
at
first
that
it
was
only
one
of
those
devices
intended
to
make
the
final
victory
more
sweet
by
putting
difficulties
in
the
way
but
finding
that
her
resistance
was
genuine
i
exclaimed
how
was
i
to
expect
a
refusal
like
this
at
a
moment
when
i
thought
i
saw
my
ardours
reflected
in
your
eyes
your
eyes
did
not
deceive
you
but
what
would
my
husband
say
if
he
found
me
otherwise
than
as
god
has
made
me
he
ca
have
left
you
untouched
he
really
has
done
so
you
can
see
for
yourself
if
you
like
can
i
then
give
to
you
what
appertains
to
the
genius
of
the
you
are
right
my
angel
this
fruit
must
be
kept
for
a
mouth
unworthy
to
taste
it
i
pity
and
adore
you
come
to
my
arms
abandon
yourself
to
my
love
and
fear
nothing
the
fruit
shall
not
be
damaged
i
will
but
taste
the
outer
surface
and
leave
no
trace
behind
we
passed
three
hours
in
trifling
together
in
a
manner
calculated
to
inflame
our
passions
despite
the
libations
which
we
now
and
again
poured
forth
i
was
consoled
by
her
swearing
to
be
mine
as
soon
as
baret
had
good
grounds
for
thinking
that
she
was
his
and
after
taking
her
on
the
boulevards
i
left
her
at
her
door
with
a
present
of
louis
i
was
in
love
with
her
as
i
had
never
been
before
and
i
passed
the
shop
three
or
four
times
a
day
going
round
and
round
to
the
wrath
of
my
coachman
who
got
sick
of
telling
me
that
i
was
ruining
my
horses
i
was
happy
to
see
her
watch
for
the
moment
that
i
passed
and
waft
me
a
kiss
by
putting
her
pretty
fingers
to
her
mouth
we
had
agreed
that
she
should
not
make
me
a
sign
to
leave
my
coach
till
her
husband
had
forced
a
passage
at
last
this
day
so
ardently
desired
and
so
long
waited
for
arrived
the
sign
was
given
and
i
stopped
the
coach
and
she
came
out
and
standing
on
the
step
told
me
to
go
and
wait
for
her
at
the
church
door
of
germain
i
was
curious
to
know
what
the
results
would
be
and
had
not
been
at
the
place
appointed
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
she
came
towards
me
her
head
muffled
in
a
hood
she
got
into
the
carriage
and
saying
that
she
wanted
to
make
some
purchases
begged
me
to
take
her
to
the
shops
i
had
business
of
my
own
and
pressing
business
too
but
who
can
refuse
the
beloved
object
anything
i
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
place
dauphine
and
i
prepared
to
loosen
my
as
i
had
a
feeling
she
was
going
to
treat
me
as
a
friend
in
point
of
fact
she
left
few
shops
unvisited
going
from
jewels
to
pretty
trifles
and
toys
of
different
kinds
and
from
these
to
dresses
of
the
latest
fashion
which
they
displayed
before
her
addressing
her
as
princess
and
saying
that
this
would
become
her
admirably
she
looked
at
me
and
said
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
was
very
pretty
and
that
she
would
like
it
if
it
were
not
so
dear
i
was
a
willing
dupe
and
assured
her
that
if
she
liked
it
it
could
not
be
too
dear
and
that
i
would
pay
while
my
sweetheart
was
thus
choosing
one
trifle
after
another
my
brought
about
an
incident
which
placed
me
in
a
fearful
situation
four
years
afterwards
the
chain
of
events
is
endless
i
perceived
at
my
left
hand
a
pretty
girl
of
twelve
or
thirteen
with
an
old
and
ugly
woman
who
was
disparaging
a
pair
of
which
the
girl
had
in
her
hands
and
on
which
she
had
evidently
set
her
heart
she
looked
sad
at
not
being
able
to
buy
them
i
heard
her
say
to
the
old
woman
that
they
would
make
her
happy
but
she
snatched
them
from
the
girl
hands
and
told
her
to
come
away
i
can
let
you
have
a
cheaper
pair
and
almost
as
fine
said
the
shopwoman
but
the
young
lady
said
she
did
not
care
about
it
and
was
getting
ready
to
go
making
a
profound
reverence
to
my
princess
baret
she
no
doubt
flattered
by
this
sign
of
respect
went
up
to
her
called
her
little
queen
told
her
she
was
as
fair
as
a
may
morning
and
asked
the
old
woman
her
name
she
is
mdlle
de
boulainvilier
my
niece
how
can
you
be
so
said
i
to
the
aunt
as
to
refuse
your
charming
niece
a
toy
which
would
make
her
happy
allow
me
to
make
her
a
present
of
them
so
saying
i
put
the
in
the
girl
hands
while
she
blushed
and
looked
at
her
aunt
as
if
to
ask
her
permission
you
may
have
the
said
she
as
this
gentleman
has
been
kind
enough
to
give
you
such
a
present
and
you
should
give
him
a
kiss
by
way
of
thanks
the
said
the
shopwoman
will
be
only
three
louis
hereupon
the
affair
took
a
comic
turn
the
old
woman
got
into
a
rage
and
said
how
can
you
be
such
a
cheat
you
told
me
they
were
only
two
louis
nay
madam
i
asked
three
that
a
lie
and
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
rob
this
gentleman
niece
put
those
down
let
the
shopwoman
keep
them
so
far
all
was
well
enough
but
the
old
aunt
spoilt
everything
by
saying
that
if
i
liked
to
give
her
niece
the
three
louis
she
could
get
her
a
pair
twice
as
good
at
another
shop
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
so
i
smilingly
put
the
three
louis
in
front
of
the
young
lady
who
still
had
the
in
her
hands
the
who
was
on
the
pocketed
the
money
saying
that
the
bargain
was
made
that
the
three
louis
belonged
to
her
and
the
to
the
young
lady
you
are
a
cheat
cried
out
the
enraged
old
woman
and
you
are
an
old
b
d
answered
the
i
know
you
well
a
crowd
began
to
gather
in
front
of
the
shop
hearing
the
cries
of
the
two
harpies
foreseeing
a
good
deal
of
unpleasantness
i
took
the
aunt
by
the
arm
and
led
her
gently
away
the
niece
who
was
quite
content
with
the
and
did
not
care
whether
they
cost
three
louis
or
two
followed
her
we
shall
hear
of
them
again
in
due
course
my
dear
baret
having
made
me
waste
a
score
of
louis
which
her
poor
husband
would
have
regretted
much
more
than
myself
we
got
into
the
carriage
again
and
i
took
her
to
the
church
door
from
which
we
had
started
on
the
way
she
told
me
she
was
coming
to
stop
a
few
days
with
me
at
little
poland
and
that
it
was
her
husband
who
would
ask
me
for
the
invitation
when
will
he
do
that
if
you
go
by
the
shop
come
and
buy
some
stockings
i
shall
have
a
bad
headache
and
baret
will
speak
to
you
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
took
care
to
call
the
next
day
and
as
i
did
not
see
his
wife
in
the
shop
i
asked
in
a
friendly
way
after
her
health
she
is
ill
in
bed
he
replied
she
wants
a
little
country
air
if
you
have
not
fixed
for
any
place
i
shall
be
happy
to
put
you
up
at
little
poland
he
replied
by
a
smile
of
delight
i
will
go
and
urge
her
to
come
myself
in
the
meanwhile
baret
will
you
pack
me
up
a
dozen
pairs
of
stockings
i
went
upstairs
and
found
the
invalid
in
bed
and
laughing
in
spite
of
her
imaginary
headache
the
business
is
done
said
i
you
will
soon
hear
of
it
as
i
had
said
the
husband
came
upstairs
with
my
stockings
and
told
her
that
i
had
been
good
enough
to
give
her
a
room
in
my
house
the
crafty
little
creature
thanked
me
assuring
her
husband
that
the
fresh
air
would
soon
cure
her
you
shall
be
well
looked
after
said
i
but
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
keep
you
company
i
have
to
attend
to
my
business
baret
will
be
able
to
come
and
sleep
with
you
every
night
and
start
early
enough
in
the
morning
to
be
in
time
for
the
opening
of
his
shop
after
many
compliments
had
been
interchanged
baret
decided
on
having
his
sister
stay
in
the
house
while
his
wife
was
away
and
as
i
took
leave
i
said
that
i
should
give
orders
for
their
reception
that
very
evening
in
case
i
was
out
when
they
came
next
day
i
stayed
out
till
after
midnight
and
the
cook
told
me
that
the
wedded
couple
had
made
a
good
supper
and
had
gone
to
bed
i
warned
her
that
i
should
be
dining
at
home
every
day
and
that
i
should
not
see
my
company
the
following
day
i
was
up
betimes
and
on
enquiring
if
the
husband
had
risen
i
learnt
that
he
had
got
up
at
and
would
not
be
back
till
the
wife
was
still
asleep
i
thought
with
reason
she
was
not
asleep
for
me
and
i
went
to
pay
her
my
first
visit
in
point
of
fact
she
was
awake
and
i
took
a
foretaste
of
greater
joys
by
a
thousand
kisses
which
she
returned
with
interest
we
jested
at
the
expense
of
the
worthy
man
who
had
trusted
me
with
a
jewel
of
which
i
was
about
to
make
such
good
use
and
we
congratulated
each
other
on
the
prospect
of
a
mutual
pleasures
come
my
dear
said
i
get
up
and
put
on
a
few
clothes
and
we
will
take
breakfast
in
my
room
she
did
not
make
an
elaborate
toilette
a
cotton
dressing
gown
a
pretty
lace
cap
a
lawn
kerchief
that
was
all
but
how
the
simple
dress
was
lighted
by
the
roses
of
her
cheeks
we
were
quick
over
our
breakfast
we
were
in
a
hurry
and
when
we
had
done
i
shut
the
door
and
we
gave
ourselves
over
to
the
enjoyment
of
our
bliss
surprised
to
find
her
in
the
same
condition
in
which
i
had
left
her
i
told
her
i
had
hoped
but
she
without
giving
me
time
to
finish
the
phrase
said
my
jewel
baret
thinks
or
pretends
to
think
that
he
has
done
his
duty
as
a
husband
but
he
is
no
hand
at
the
business
and
i
am
disposed
to
put
myself
in
your
hands
and
then
there
will
be
no
doubt
of
my
condition
we
shall
thus
my
sweet
be
doing
him
a
service
and
the
service
shall
be
well
done
as
i
said
these
words
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
temple
and
i
opened
the
door
in
a
manner
that
overthrew
all
obstacles
a
little
scream
and
then
several
sighs
announced
the
completion
of
the
sacrifice
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
altar
of
love
was
covered
with
the
blood
of
the
victim
after
the
necessary
ablutions
the
priest
once
more
began
his
pious
work
while
the
victim
growing
bolder
so
provoked
his
rage
that
it
was
not
till
the
fourth
mactation
that
we
rested
and
put
off
our
joust
to
another
season
we
swore
a
thousand
times
to
love
each
other
and
to
remain
constant
and
we
may
possibly
have
been
sincere
as
we
were
in
our
ecstasy
of
pleasure
we
only
separated
to
dress
then
after
taking
a
turn
in
the
garden
we
dined
together
sure
that
in
a
sumptuous
repast
washed
down
by
the
choicest
wines
we
should
find
strength
to
reanimate
our
desires
and
to
lull
them
to
sleep
in
bliss
at
dessert
as
i
was
pouring
champagne
into
her
glass
i
asked
her
how
with
such
a
fiery
temperament
she
had
managed
to
preserve
her
virtue
cupid
said
i
might
have
gathered
the
fruit
that
hymen
could
not
taste
you
are
seventeen
and
the
pear
has
been
ripe
for
two
years
at
least
very
true
but
i
have
never
had
a
lover
never
i
have
been
courted
but
to
no
effect
my
heart
was
ever
silent
possibly
my
father
thought
otherwise
when
i
begged
him
a
month
ago
to
get
me
married
soon
very
likely
but
as
you
were
not
in
love
why
were
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
knew
that
the
duc
would
soon
be
coming
to
town
and
that
if
he
found
me
still
single
he
would
oblige
me
to
become
the
wife
of
a
man
i
detest
who
would
have
me
at
any
price
who
is
this
man
for
whom
you
have
such
an
aversion
he
is
one
of
the
duke
pets
a
monster
who
sleeps
with
his
master
really
i
did
not
know
the
duke
had
such
tastes
oh
yes
he
is
and
he
thinks
himself
a
woman
he
says
he
must
have
a
husband
that
is
very
funny
and
is
this
aspirant
to
your
hand
a
handsome
man
i
think
him
horrible
but
everybody
else
thinks
he
is
a
fine
man
the
charming
baret
spent
a
week
with
me
and
each
day
we
renewed
the
combat
in
which
we
were
always
conquerors
and
always
conquered
i
have
seen
few
women
as
pretty
and
seductive
and
none
whose
skin
was
more
exquisitely
soft
and
fair
her
breath
was
aromatic
and
this
made
her
kisses
most
sweet
her
neck
was
exquisitely
shaped
and
the
two
globes
tipped
with
coral
were
as
hard
as
marble
the
exquisite
curves
of
her
figure
would
have
defied
the
skill
of
the
ablest
painter
i
experienced
an
ineffable
joy
in
contemplating
her
and
in
the
midst
of
my
happiness
i
called
myself
unhappy
because
i
could
not
satisfy
all
the
desires
which
her
charms
aroused
in
me
the
frieze
which
crowned
her
columns
was
composed
of
links
of
pale
gold
of
the
utmost
fineness
and
my
fingers
strove
in
vain
to
give
them
another
direction
to
that
which
nature
had
given
them
she
could
easily
have
been
taught
those
lively
yet
graceful
movements
which
double
the
pleasure
nature
had
done
her
part
in
that
direction
and
i
do
not
think
a
more
expert
mistress
in
the
art
of
love
could
be
found
each
of
us
looked
forward
to
the
day
of
her
departure
with
equal
grief
and
our
only
consolation
lay
in
the
hope
of
meeting
again
and
often
three
days
after
she
went
away
i
went
to
see
her
more
in
love
than
ever
and
i
gave
her
two
notes
of
five
thousand
francs
apiece
her
husband
might
have
his
suspicions
but
he
was
too
happy
at
being
enabled
to
pay
his
debts
and
to
keep
his
shop
open
to
say
anything
unpleasant
many
husbands
besides
himself
think
themselves
lucky
to
have
such
productive
wives
in
the
beginning
of
november
i
sold
shares
for
fifty
thousand
francs
to
a
man
named
gamier
living
in
the
rue
du
mail
giving
up
to
him
a
third
part
of
the
materials
in
my
warehouse
and
accepting
a
manager
chosen
by
him
and
paid
by
the
company
three
days
after
signing
the
deed
i
received
the
money
but
in
the
night
the
doctor
my
warehouseman
emptied
the
till
and
absconded
i
have
always
thought
that
this
robbery
could
not
have
been
effected
without
the
connivance
of
the
painter
this
loss
was
a
serious
blow
to
me
as
my
affairs
were
getting
into
an
embroiled
condition
and
for
a
finishing
touch
to
my
misfortunes
gamier
had
me
served
with
a
summons
to
repay
him
the
fifty
thousand
francs
my
answer
was
that
i
was
not
liable
that
his
manager
had
been
appointed
the
agreement
and
sale
of
the
shares
was
valid
and
that
he
being
one
of
the
company
would
have
to
share
in
the
loss
as
he
persisted
in
his
claim
i
was
advised
to
go
to
law
but
gamier
declared
the
agreement
null
and
void
accusing
me
in
an
indirect
manner
of
having
appropriated
the
money
which
i
had
said
was
stolen
i
would
willingly
have
given
him
a
good
thrashing
but
he
was
an
old
man
and
that
course
would
not
have
mended
matters
so
i
kept
my
temper
the
merchant
who
had
given
surety
for
the
doctor
was
not
to
be
found
he
had
become
bankrupt
garnier
had
all
my
stock
seized
and
sequestrated
my
horses
carriages
and
all
my
private
property
while
these
troubles
were
harassing
me
i
dismissed
all
my
who
had
always
been
a
great
expense
and
replaced
them
with
workmen
and
some
of
my
servants
the
painter
still
retained
his
position
which
was
an
assured
one
as
he
always
paid
himself
out
of
the
sales
my
attorney
was
an
honest
man
a
rare
bird
amongst
lawyers
but
my
counsel
who
kept
telling
me
that
the
case
would
soon
be
decided
was
a
rascal
while
the
decision
was
pending
garnier
served
me
with
a
writ
to
pay
the
sum
claimed
i
took
it
to
my
counsel
who
promised
to
appeal
the
same
day
which
he
did
not
do
while
he
appropriated
to
his
own
use
the
money
assigned
by
me
for
the
costs
of
an
action
which
if
there
had
been
justice
in
france
i
should
certainly
have
gained
two
other
summonses
were
issued
against
me
and
before
i
knew
what
was
going
on
a
warrant
was
issued
for
my
arrest
i
was
seized
at
eight
in
the
morning
as
i
was
driving
along
the
rue
denis
the
sergeant
of
police
sat
beside
me
a
second
got
up
beside
the
coachman
and
a
third
stationed
himself
at
the
back
of
the
coach
and
in
this
state
we
drove
to
fort
as
soon
as
the
police
had
handed
me
over
to
the
gaoler
he
informed
me
that
by
payment
of
the
fifty
thousand
francs
or
by
giving
good
bail
i
might
instantly
regain
my
freedom
for
the
moment
said
i
i
can
neither
command
money
nor
bail
very
good
then
you
will
stay
in
prison
the
gaoler
took
me
to
a
room
and
i
told
him
i
had
only
been
served
with
one
writ
very
likely
answered
he
it
often
happens
like
that
but
it
is
rather
difficult
to
prove
bring
me
writing
materials
and
have
a
trusty
messenger
at
my
disposal
i
wrote
to
my
counsel
my
attorney
to
madame
and
to
all
my
friends
including
my
brother
who
was
just
married
the
attorney
called
immediately
but
the
barrister
contented
himself
with
writing
to
the
effect
that
as
he
had
put
in
an
appeal
my
seizure
was
illegal
and
that
damages
might
be
recovered
he
ended
by
begging
me
to
give
him
a
free
hand
and
to
have
patience
for
a
few
days
manon
baletti
sent
her
brother
with
her
diamond
earrings
madame
du
rumain
dispatched
her
barrister
a
man
of
rare
honesty
to
me
and
wrote
a
friendly
note
in
which
she
said
that
if
i
wanted
five
hundred
louis
i
should
have
them
my
brother
neither
wrote
nor
came
to
see
me
as
to
dear
madame
she
sent
to
say
that
she
would
expect
me
at
dinner
i
thought
she
had
gone
mad
as
i
could
not
think
she
was
making
fun
of
me
at
eleven
my
room
was
full
of
people
poor
baret
had
come
weeping
and
offering
me
all
his
shop
held
i
was
touched
by
the
worthy
man
kindness
at
last
i
was
told
that
a
lady
in
a
coach
wanted
to
see
me
i
waited
but
nobody
came
in
my
impatience
i
called
the
turnkey
who
told
me
that
after
questioning
the
clerk
of
the
prison
she
had
gone
away
again
from
the
description
i
was
given
i
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
the
lady
with
madame
to
find
myself
deprived
of
my
liberty
was
a
disagreeable
shock
to
me
i
thought
of
the
leads
and
though
my
present
situation
was
not
to
be
compared
with
that
i
cursed
my
fate
as
i
foresaw
that
my
imprisonment
would
damage
my
reputation
i
had
thirty
thousand
francs
in
hard
cash
and
jewels
to
more
than
double
that
amount
but
i
could
not
decide
on
making
such
a
sacrifice
in
spite
of
the
advice
given
by
madame
du
barrister
who
would
have
me
got
out
of
prison
at
any
cost
all
you
have
to
do
said
the
barrister
is
to
deposit
half
the
sum
demanded
which
i
will
give
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
in
a
short
time
i
can
promise
a
decision
in
your
favour
and
the
restoration
of
your
money
we
were
discussing
the
matter
when
the
gaoler
entered
and
said
very
politely
sir
you
are
a
free
man
again
and
a
lady
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
door
in
her
carriage
i
called
le
duc
my
man
and
told
him
to
go
and
see
who
the
lady
was
he
returned
with
the
information
that
it
was
madame
i
made
my
bow
to
everybody
and
after
four
very
disagreeable
hours
of
imprisonment
i
found
myself
free
again
and
sitting
in
a
splendid
coach
madame
received
me
with
dignified
kindness
and
a
judge
who
was
in
the
carriage
apologized
for
his
country
where
strangers
were
exposed
to
such
insults
i
thanked
madame
in
a
few
words
telling
her
that
i
was
glad
to
become
her
debtor
but
that
it
was
garnier
who
benefited
by
her
generosity
she
replied
with
a
pleasant
smile
that
she
was
not
so
sure
of
that
and
that
we
would
talk
it
over
at
dinner
she
wanted
me
to
go
and
walk
in
the
tuileries
and
the
palais
royal
to
convince
people
that
the
report
of
my
imprisonment
had
been
false
i
thought
the
advice
excellent
and
as
i
set
out
i
promised
to
be
with
her
at
two
after
skewing
myself
at
the
two
principal
walks
of
paris
amusing
myself
by
the
astonishment
depicted
on
certain
faces
well
known
to
me
i
went
and
returned
the
to
my
dear
manon
who
gave
an
astonished
but
a
happy
cry
when
she
saw
me
i
thanked
her
tenderly
for
the
proof
she
had
given
me
of
her
attachment
and
said
that
i
had
been
arrested
by
a
plot
for
which
i
would
make
the
plotters
pay
dear
after
promising
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
i
went
to
madame
this
good
lady
whose
foible
is
well
known
to
my
readers
made
me
laugh
when
she
said
that
her
genius
had
told
her
that
i
had
got
myself
arrested
to
be
talked
about
for
reasons
which
were
known
only
to
myself
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
your
arrest
said
she
i
went
to
the
fort
and
on
learning
from
the
clerk
what
the
affair
was
about
i
deposited
bonds
to
bail
you
out
if
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
have
justice
done
you
gamier
will
have
to
reckon
with
me
before
he
takes
the
money
i
have
deposited
but
your
first
step
should
be
to
commence
a
criminal
prosecution
against
your
counsel
who
has
not
only
failed
to
put
in
your
appeal
but
has
robbed
and
deceived
you
i
left
her
in
the
evening
assuring
her
that
in
a
few
days
her
bail
should
be
returned
to
her
and
went
to
the
french
and
italian
plays
in
succession
taking
care
to
render
myself
conspicuous
that
my
reappearance
might
be
complete
afterwards
i
went
to
sup
with
manon
baletti
who
was
too
happy
to
have
had
an
opportunity
of
spewing
her
affection
for
me
and
her
joy
was
full
when
i
told
her
that
i
was
going
to
give
up
business
for
she
thought
that
my
seraglio
was
the
only
obstacle
to
my
marriage
with
her
the
next
day
was
passed
with
madame
du
rumain
i
felt
that
my
obligations
to
her
were
great
while
she
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
was
persuaded
that
she
could
make
no
adequate
return
to
me
for
the
oracles
with
which
i
furnished
her
and
by
following
which
she
was
safely
guided
through
the
perplexities
of
life
i
can
not
understand
how
she
whose
wit
was
keen
and
whose
judgment
on
other
subjects
was
of
the
soundest
kind
could
be
liable
to
such
folly
i
was
sorry
when
i
reflected
that
i
could
not
undeceive
her
and
glad
when
i
reflected
that
to
this
deceit
of
mine
the
kindness
she
had
shewn
me
was
chiefly
due
my
imprisonment
disgusted
me
with
paris
and
made
me
conceive
a
hatred
of
the
law
which
i
feel
now
i
found
myself
entangled
in
a
double
maze
of
knavery
garnier
was
my
foe
and
so
was
my
own
counsel
every
time
i
went
to
plead
to
spend
my
money
amongst
lawyers
and
to
waste
the
time
better
given
to
pleasure
i
felt
as
if
i
was
going
to
execution
in
this
perturbed
kind
of
life
so
contrary
to
my
inclinations
i
resolved
to
set
to
work
in
earnest
to
make
my
fortune
so
that
i
might
become
independent
and
free
to
enjoy
life
according
to
my
tastes
i
decided
in
the
first
place
that
i
would
cut
myself
free
of
all
that
bound
me
to
paris
make
a
second
journey
into
holland
to
replenish
my
purse
and
invest
my
money
in
a
yearly
income
for
two
lives
and
from
thenceforth
live
free
from
care
the
two
lives
were
those
of
my
wife
and
myself
my
wife
would
be
manon
baletti
and
when
i
told
her
my
plans
she
would
have
thought
them
delightful
if
i
had
begun
by
marrying
her
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
give
up
little
poland
i
then
drew
the
thousand
francs
which
were
my
surety
for
keeping
a
lottery
office
in
the
rue
denis
thus
i
got
rid
of
my
ridiculous
office
of
lottery
receiver
and
after
getting
my
clerk
married
i
handed
over
the
office
to
him
in
short
i
made
his
fortune
a
friend
of
his
wife
was
his
surety
such
things
often
happen
i
did
not
like
to
leave
madame
involved
in
a
troublesome
suit
with
gamier
so
i
went
to
versailles
to
see
the
abbe
de
la
ville
a
great
friend
of
his
and
begged
him
to
induce
gamier
to
make
a
composition
the
abbe
saw
that
his
friend
was
in
the
wrong
and
so
was
all
the
more
willing
to
help
me
and
a
few
days
afterwards
he
wrote
to
me
to
go
and
see
him
assuring
me
that
i
should
find
him
inclined
to
arrange
matters
in
a
friendly
manner
gamier
was
at
ruelle
where
he
had
a
house
which
cost
him
four
hundred
thousand
francs
a
fine
estate
for
a
man
who
had
made
his
money
as
an
army
contractor
during
the
last
war
he
was
rich
but
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
still
fond
of
women
at
the
age
of
seventy
while
his
impotence
debarred
him
from
the
proper
enjoyment
of
their
society
i
found
him
in
company
with
three
young
ladies
all
of
whom
were
pretty
and
as
i
heard
afterwards
of
good
families
but
they
were
poor
and
their
necessities
forced
them
to
submit
to
a
disgusting
intercourse
with
the
old
profligate
i
stayed
to
dinner
and
admired
the
propriety
and
modesty
of
their
behaviour
in
spite
of
the
humiliation
which
accompanies
poverty
after
dinner
gamier
went
to
sleep
and
left
me
to
entertain
these
girls
whom
i
would
willingly
have
rescued
from
their
unfortunate
situation
if
i
had
been
able
after
gamier
woke
we
went
into
his
study
to
talk
over
our
business
at
first
he
maintained
his
claim
tenaciously
and
seemed
unwilling
to
yield
an
inch
but
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
leaving
paris
in
a
few
days
he
saw
that
as
he
could
not
keep
me
madame
might
take
the
suit
over
and
carry
it
on
to
infinity
and
that
he
might
lose
it
at
last
that
made
him
think
it
over
and
he
asked
me
to
stay
in
his
house
for
the
night
the
next
day
after
breakfast
he
said
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
will
have
thousand
francs
or
keep
the
matter
before
the
courts
till
my
dying
day
i
answered
that
he
would
find
the
sum
in
the
hands
of
madame
solicitor
and
that
he
could
receive
it
as
soon
as
he
had
given
replevy
on
the
bail
at
the
fort
i
could
not
persuade
madame
that
i
had
acted
wisely
in
coming
to
an
arrangement
till
i
had
told
her
that
my
genius
had
commanded
me
not
to
leave
paris
before
my
affairs
were
settled
so
that
no
one
might
be
able
to
accuse
me
of
having
gone
away
to
avoid
creditors
whose
claims
i
could
not
satisfy
three
or
four
days
afterwards
i
went
to
take
leave
of
de
choiseul
who
promised
to
instruct
to
aid
me
in
negotiating
a
loan
at
five
per
cent
either
with
the
or
a
private
company
you
can
tell
everyone
said
he
that
peace
is
certain
to
be
made
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
have
what
is
due
to
you
on
your
return
to
france
de
choiseul
deceived
me
for
he
knew
very
well
that
peace
would
not
be
made
but
i
had
no
definite
project
and
i
repented
of
having
given
de
boulogne
my
confidence
and
also
of
having
done
anything
for
the
government
the
reward
of
which
was
not
immediate
and
certain
i
sold
my
horses
my
carriages
my
furniture
i
went
bail
for
my
brother
who
had
contracted
debts
he
was
sure
of
paying
as
he
had
several
pictures
on
the
easel
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
paint
by
some
of
his
rich
and
noble
patrons
i
took
leave
of
manon
whom
i
left
in
floods
of
tears
though
i
swore
with
the
utmost
sincerity
to
come
back
soon
and
marry
her
at
last
all
my
preparations
were
finished
and
i
left
paris
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
bills
of
exchange
and
jewels
to
the
same
amount
i
was
alone
in
my
le
duc
preceding
me
on
horseback
which
the
rascal
preferred
to
being
shut
up
in
a
carriage
this
le
duc
of
mine
was
a
spaniard
aged
eighteen
a
sharp
fellow
whom
i
valued
highly
especially
because
he
did
my
hair
better
than
anyone
else
i
never
refused
him
a
pleasure
which
a
little
money
would
buy
besides
him
i
had
a
good
swiss
servant
who
served
as
my
courier
it
was
the
of
december
and
the
air
was
frosty
but
i
was
fortified
against
the
inclemency
of
the
season
i
was
able
to
read
comfortably
and
i
took
helvetius
esprit
which
i
had
never
had
time
to
read
before
after
perusing
it
i
was
equally
astonished
at
the
sensation
it
created
and
at
the
stupidity
of
the
high
court
which
condemned
it
of
course
that
exalted
body
was
largely
influenced
by
the
king
and
the
clergy
and
between
them
all
no
effort
was
spared
to
ruin
helvetius
a
man
with
more
wit
than
his
book
i
saw
nothing
novel
either
in
the
historical
part
relating
to
the
morals
of
nations
in
which
helvetius
dismisses
us
as
triflers
or
in
the
position
that
morality
is
dependent
on
the
reason
all
that
he
says
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
and
blaise
pascal
went
much
farther
but
he
wrote
more
skilfully
and
better
in
every
way
than
helvetius
who
wishing
to
remain
in
france
was
obliged
to
retract
he
preferred
a
quiet
life
to
his
honour
and
his
philosophy
his
wife
had
a
nobler
soul
than
he
as
she
wanted
to
sell
all
they
had
and
to
take
refuge
in
holland
rather
than
submit
to
the
shame
of
a
recantation
perhaps
helvetius
would
have
followed
the
noble
advice
of
his
wife
if
he
had
foreseen
that
this
monstrous
recantation
would
make
his
book
into
a
fraud
for
he
had
to
confess
that
he
had
written
without
due
reflection
that
he
was
more
in
jest
than
earnest
and
that
his
arguments
were
mere
sophisms
but
many
men
of
keen
intellects
had
not
waited
for
him
to
recant
before
exposing
this
wretched
system
of
his
and
admitting
that
whatever
man
does
is
done
for
his
own
interest
does
it
follow
that
gratitude
is
a
folly
and
virtue
and
vice
identical
are
a
villain
and
a
man
of
honour
to
be
weighed
in
the
same
balance
if
such
a
dreadful
system
were
not
absurd
virtue
would
be
mere
hypocrisy
and
if
by
any
possibility
it
were
true
it
ought
to
be
proscribed
by
general
consent
since
it
would
lead
to
general
ruin
and
corruption
it
might
have
been
proved
to
helvetius
that
the
propositions
that
the
first
motive
is
always
and
that
we
should
always
consult
our
own
interest
first
are
fallacious
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
so
virtuous
a
man
would
not
admit
the
existence
of
virtue
it
is
an
amusing
suggestion
that
he
only
published
his
book
out
of
modesty
but
that
would
have
contradicted
his
own
system
but
if
it
were
so
was
it
well
done
to
render
himself
contemptible
to
escape
the
imputation
of
pride
modesty
is
only
a
virtue
when
it
is
natural
if
it
is
put
on
or
merely
the
result
of
training
it
is
detestable
the
great
was
the
most
truly
modest
man
i
have
ever
seen
when
i
got
to
brussels
where
i
spent
two
days
i
went
to
the
hotel
de
and
chance
sent
mdlle
and
farsetti
in
my
way
but
i
pretended
not
to
see
them
from
brussels
i
went
straight
to
the
hague
and
got
out
at
the
prince
of
orange
on
my
asking
the
host
who
sat
down
at
his
table
he
told
me
his
company
consisted
of
general
officers
of
the
hanoverian
army
same
english
ladies
and
a
prince
piccolomini
and
his
wife
and
this
made
me
make
up
my
mind
to
join
this
illustrious
assemblage
i
was
unknown
to
all
and
keeping
my
eyes
about
me
i
gave
my
chief
attention
to
the
observation
of
the
supposed
italian
princess
who
was
pretty
enough
and
more
especially
of
her
husband
whom
i
seemed
to
recognize
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
heard
some
talk
of
the
celebrated
germain
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
stopping
in
the
same
hotel
i
had
returned
to
my
room
and
was
thinking
of
going
to
bed
when
prince
piccolomini
entered
and
embraced
me
as
an
old
friend
a
look
in
your
face
said
he
tells
me
that
the
recognition
has
been
mutual
i
knew
you
directly
in
spite
of
the
sixteen
years
that
have
passed
since
we
saw
each
other
at
vicenza
you
can
tell
everybody
that
we
are
friends
and
that
though
i
am
not
a
prince
i
am
really
a
count
here
is
my
passport
from
the
king
of
naples
pray
read
it
during
this
rapid
monologue
i
could
not
get
in
a
single
word
and
on
attentively
scanning
his
features
i
could
only
recollect
that
i
had
seen
him
before
but
when
or
where
or
how
i
knew
not
i
opened
the
passport
and
read
the
name
of
ruggero
di
rocco
count
piccolomini
that
was
enough
i
remembered
an
individual
of
that
name
who
was
a
in
vicenza
and
on
looking
at
him
again
his
aspect
though
much
changed
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
swordsman
and
the
count
i
congratulate
you
said
i
on
your
change
of
employment
your
new
business
is
doubtless
much
better
than
the
old
i
taught
fencing
he
replied
to
save
myself
from
dying
of
hunger
for
my
father
was
so
hard
a
man
that
he
would
not
give
me
the
wherewithal
to
live
and
i
disguised
my
name
so
as
not
to
disgrace
it
on
my
death
i
succeeded
to
the
property
and
at
rome
i
married
the
lady
you
have
seen
you
had
good
taste
for
she
a
pretty
woman
she
is
generally
thought
so
and
it
was
a
love
match
on
my
side
he
ended
by
asking
me
to
come
and
see
him
in
his
room
the
next
day
after
dinner
telling
me
that
i
should
find
good
company
and
a
bank
at
faro
which
he
kept
himself
he
added
without
ceremony
that
if
i
liked
we
could
go
half
shares
and
that
i
should
find
it
profitable
i
thanked
him
and
promised
to
pay
him
a
visit
i
went
abroad
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
and
after
having
spent
some
time
with
the
jew
boaz
and
having
given
a
polite
refusal
to
his
offer
of
a
bed
i
went
to
pay
my
respects
to
who
since
the
death
of
the
princess
of
orange
the
regent
of
the
low
countries
was
generally
known
as
his
most
christian
majesty
ambassador
he
gave
me
an
excellent
reception
but
he
said
that
if
i
had
returned
to
holland
hoping
to
do
business
on
behalf
of
the
government
i
should
waste
my
time
since
the
action
of
the
had
lowered
the
credit
of
the
nation
which
was
thought
to
be
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
this
silhouette
said
he
has
served
the
king
very
badly
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
payments
are
only
suspended
for
a
year
but
it
is
not
believed
he
then
asked
me
if
i
knew
a
certain
comte
de
germain
who
had
lately
arrived
at
the
hague
he
has
not
called
on
me
said
the
ambassador
though
he
says
he
is
commissioned
by
the
king
to
negotiate
a
loan
of
a
hundred
millions
when
i
am
asked
about
him
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
i
know
nothing
about
him
for
fear
of
compromising
myself
such
a
reply
as
you
can
understand
is
not
likely
to
increase
his
chance
of
success
but
that
is
his
fault
and
not
mine
why
has
he
not
brought
me
a
letter
from
the
duc
de
choiseul
or
the
marquise
de
pompadour
i
take
him
to
be
an
impostor
but
i
shall
know
something
more
about
him
in
the
course
of
ten
days
i
told
him
in
my
turn
all
i
knew
of
this
truly
eccentric
individual
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
that
the
king
had
given
him
an
apartment
at
chambord
but
when
i
told
him
that
the
count
professed
to
be
able
to
make
diamonds
he
laughed
and
said
that
in
that
case
he
would
no
doubt
make
the
hundred
millions
just
as
i
was
leaving
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
on
the
following
day
on
returning
to
the
hotel
i
called
on
the
comte
de
germain
you
have
anticipated
me
said
he
on
seeing
me
enter
i
intended
to
have
called
on
you
i
suppose
my
dear
casanova
that
you
have
come
to
try
what
you
can
do
for
our
court
but
you
will
find
your
task
a
difficult
one
as
the
exchange
is
highly
offended
at
the
late
doings
of
that
fool
silhouette
all
the
same
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
get
my
hundred
millions
i
have
passed
my
word
to
my
friend
louis
xv
i
may
call
him
so
and
i
ca
disappoint
him
the
business
will
be
done
in
the
next
three
or
four
weeks
i
should
think
might
assist
you
i
do
not
require
his
assistance
probably
i
shall
not
even
call
upon
him
as
he
might
say
he
helped
me
no
i
shall
have
all
the
trouble
and
i
mean
to
have
all
the
glory
too
i
presume
you
will
be
going
to
court
where
the
duke
of
brunswick
may
be
of
service
to
you
why
should
i
go
to
court
as
for
the
duke
of
brunswick
i
do
not
care
to
know
him
all
i
have
got
to
do
is
to
go
to
amsterdam
where
my
credit
is
sufficiently
good
for
anything
i
am
fond
of
the
king
of
france
not
a
better
man
in
the
kingdom
well
come
and
dine
at
the
high
table
the
company
is
of
the
best
and
will
please
you
you
know
i
never
eat
moreover
i
never
sit
down
at
a
table
where
i
may
meet
persons
who
are
unknown
to
me
then
my
lord
farewell
we
shall
see
each
other
again
at
amsterdam
i
went
down
to
the
where
while
dinner
was
being
served
i
conversed
with
some
officers
they
asked
me
if
i
knew
prince
piccolomini
to
which
i
answered
that
he
was
not
a
prince
but
a
count
and
that
it
was
many
years
since
i
had
seen
him
when
the
count
and
his
fair
wife
who
only
spoke
italian
came
down
i
shewed
them
some
polite
attentions
and
we
then
sat
down
to
dinner
