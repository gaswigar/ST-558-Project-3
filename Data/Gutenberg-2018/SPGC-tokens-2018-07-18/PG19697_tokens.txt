londoner
who
lounged
intolerant
and
impatient
at
the
blacksmith
door
while
a
horse
was
shod
or

great
keynes
seemed
but
a
poor
backwater
of
a
place
compared
with
the
rush
of
the
brighton
road
eight
miles
to
the
east
from
which
he
had
turned
off
or
the
whirling
cauldron
of
london
city
twenty
miles
to
the
north
towards
which
he
was
travelling
the
triangular
green
with
its
stocks
and
overlooked
by
the
grey
benignant
seemed
a
tame
exchange
for
seething
cheapside
and
the
crowded
ways
about
the
temple
or
whitehall
and
it
was
strange
to
think
that
the
rustics
who
stared
respectfully
at
the
gorgeous
stranger
were
of
the
same
human
race
as
the
voluble
townsmen
who
chattered
and
laughed
and
grimaced
over
the
news
that
came
up
daily
from
the
continent
or
the
north
and
was
tossed
to
and
fro
embroidered
and
discredited
alternately
all
day
long
and
yet
the
great
waves
and
movements
that
rising
in
the
hearts
of
kings
and
politicians
or
in
the
sudden
strokes
of
divine
providence
swept
over
europe
and
england
eventually
always
rippled
up
into
this
placid
country
village
and
the
lives
of
master
musgrave
who
had
retired
upon
his
earnings
and
of
old
martin
who
cobbled
the
ploughmen
shoes
were
definitely
affected
and
changed
by
the
plans
of
scottish
gentlemen
and
the
hopes
and
fears
of
the
inhabitants
of
south
europe
through
all
the
earlier
part
of
elizabeth
reign
the
menace
of
the
spanish
empire
brooded
low
on
the
southern
horizon
and
a
responsive
mutter
of
storm
sounded
now
and
again
from
the
north
where
mary
stuart
reigned
over
men
hearts
if
not
their
homes
and
lovers
of
secular
england
shook
their
heads
and
were
silent
as
they
thought
of
their
tiny
country
so
rent
with
internal
strife
and
ringed
with
danger
for
great
keynes
however
as
for
most
english
villages
and
towns
at
this
time
secular
affairs
were
so
deeply
and
intricately
interwoven
with
ecclesiastical
matters
that
none
dared
decide
on
the
one
question
without
considering
its
relation
to
the
other
and
ecclesiastical
affairs
too
touched
them
more
personally
than
any
other
since
every
religious
change
scored
a
record
of
itself
presently
within
the
church
that
was
as
familiar
to
them
as
their
own
cottages
on
none
had
the
religious
changes
fallen
with
more
severity
than
on
the
maxwell
family
that
lived
in
the
hall
at
the
upper
and
southern
end
of
the
green
old
sir
nicholas
though
his
convictions
had
survived
the
tempest
of
unrest
and
trouble
that
had
swept
over
england
and
he
had
remained
a
convinced
and
a
stubborn
catholic
yet
his
spiritual
system
was
sore
and
inflamed
within
him
to
his
simple
and
obstinate
soul
it
was
an
irritating
puzzle
as
to
how
any
man
could
pass
from
the
old
to
a
new
faith
and
he
had
been
known
to
lay
his
whip
across
the
back
of
a
servant
who
had
professed
a
desire
to
try
the
new
religion
his
wife
a
stately
lady
a
few
years
younger
than
himself
did
what
she
could
to
keep
her
lord
quiet
and
to
save
him
from
incurring
by
his
indiscretion
any
further
penalties
beyond
the
enforced
journeys
before
the
commission
and
the
fines
inflicted
on
all
who
refused
to
attend
their
parish
church
so
the
old
man
devoted
himself
to
his
estates
and
the
further
improvement
of
the
house
and
gardens
and
to
the
inculcation
of
sound
religious
principles
into
the
minds
of
his
two
sons
who
were
living
at
home
with
their
parents
and
strove
to
hold
his
tongue
and
his
hand
in
public
the
elder
of
these
two
james
as
he
was
commonly
called
was
rather
a
mysterious
personage
to
the
village
and
to
such
neighbours
as
they
had
he
was
often
in
town
and
when
at
home
although
extremely
pleasant
and
courteous
never
talked
about
himself
and
seemed
to
be
only
very
moderately
interested
in
the
estate
and
the
generally
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
would
presumably
succeed
his
father
gave
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
gossip
and
even
some
suspicion
his
younger
brother
hubert
was
very
different
passionately
attached
to
sport
and
to
outdoor
occupations
a
fearless
rider
and
in
every
way
a
kindly
frank
lad
of
about
eighteen
years
old
the
fifth
member
of
the
family
lady
maxwell
sister
mistress
margaret
torridon
was
a
old
lady
seldom
seen
abroad
and
round
whom
as
round
her
eldest
nephew
hung
a
certain
air
of
mystery
the
difficulties
of
this
catholic
family
were
considerable
sir
religious
sympathies
were
of
course
wholly
with
the
spiritual
side
of
spain
and
all
that
that
involved
while
his
intense
love
of
england
gave
him
a
horror
of
the
southern
empire
that
the
sturdiest
patriot
might
have
envied
and
so
with
his
attitude
towards
mary
stuart
and
her
french
background
while
his
whole
soul
rose
in
loathing
against
the
crime
of
darnley
murder
to
which
many
of
her
enemies
proclaimed
her
accessory
it
was
kindled
at
the
thought
that
in
her
or
her
child
lately
crowned
as
james
vi
of
scotland
lay
the
hope
of
a
future
catholic
succession
and
this
religious
sympathy
was
impassioned
by
the
memory
of
an
interview
a
few
years
ago
when
he
had
kissed
that
gracious
white
hand
and
looked
into
those
alluring
eyes
and
kneeling
stammered
out
in
broken
french
his
loyalty
and
his
hopes
whether
it
was
by
her
devilish
craft
as
her
enemies
said
or
her
serene
and
limpid
innocence
as
her
friends
said
or
by
a
maddening
compound
of
the
two
as
later
students
have
said
at
least
she
had
made
the
heart
and
confidence
of
old
sir
nicholas
her
own
but
there
were
troubles
more
practical
than
these
mental
struggles
it
was
a
misery
beyond
describing
to
this
old
man
and
his
wife
to
see
the
church
where
once
they
had
worshipped
and
received
the
sacraments
given
over
to
what
was
in
their
opinion
a
novel
heresy
and
the
charge
of
a
schismatic
minister
there
in
the
maxwell
chapel
within
lay
the
bones
of
their
catholic
ancestors
and
there
they
had
knelt
to
adore
and
receive
their
saviour
and
now
for
them
all
was
gone
and
the
light
was
gone
out
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
in
the
days
of
the
previous
rector
matters
were
not
so
desperate
it
had
been
their
custom
to
receive
from
his
hands
at
the
of
the
church
hosts
previously
consecrated
at
the
rectory
for
the
incumbent
had
been
an
old
marian
priest
who
had
not
scrupled
so
to
relieve
his
catholic
sheep
of
the
burden
of
recusancy
while
he
fed
his
protestant
charges
with
bread
and
wine
from
the
communion
table
but
now
all
that
was
past
and
the
entire
family
was
compelled
year
by
year
to
slip
off
into
hampshire
shortly
before
easter
for
their
annual
duties
and
the
parish
church
that
their
forefathers
had
built
endowed
and
decorated
knew
them
no
more
but
the
present
rector
the
reverend
george
dent
was
far
from
a
bigot
and
the
papists
were
more
fortunate
than
perhaps
in
their
bitterness
they
recognised
for
the
minister
was
one
of
the
rising
anglican
school
then
strange
and
unfamiliar
but
which
has
now
established
itself
as
the
main
representative
section
of
the
church
of
england
he
welcomed
the
effect
but
not
the
rise
of
the
reformation
and
rejoiced
that
the
incrustations
of
error
had
been
removed
from
the
lantern
of
the
faith
but
he
no
less
sincerely
deplored
the
fanaticism
of
the
puritan
and
genevan
faction
he
exulted
to
see
england
with
a
church
truly
her
own
at
last
adapted
to
her
character
and
freed
from
the
avarice
and
tyranny
of
a
foreign
despot
who
had
assumed
prerogatives
to
which
he
had
no
right
but
he
reverenced
the
episcopate
he
wore
the
prescribed
dress
he
used
the
thick
for
the
communion
and
he
longed
for
the
time
when
nation
and
church
should
again
be
one
when
the
nation
should
worship
through
a
church
of
her
own
shaping
and
the
church
share
the
glory
and
influence
of
her
lusty
partner
and
patron
but
dent
had
little
sympathy
with
her
husband
views
she
had
assimilated
the
fiery
doctrines
of
the
genevan
refugees
and
to
her
mind
her
husband
was
balancing
himself
to
the
loss
of
all
dignity
and
consistency
in
an
untenable
position
between
the
popish
priesthood
on
the
one
side
and
the
gospel
ministry
on
the
other
it
was
an
unbearable
thought
to
her
that
through
her
husband
weak
disposition
and
principles
his
chief
parishioners
should
continue
to
live
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
rectory
in
an
assured
position
of
honour
and
in
personal
friendliness
to
a
minister
whose
ecclesiastical
status
and
claims
they
disregarded
the
rector
position
then
was
difficult
and
trying
no
less
in
his
own
house
than
elsewhere
the
third
main
family
in
the
village
was
that
of
the
norrises
who
lived
in
the
dower
house
that
stood
in
its
own
grounds
and
gardens
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
of
the
village
green
the
house
had
originally
been
part
of
the
hall
estate
but
it
had
been
sold
some
fifty
years
before
the
present
owner
henry
norris
a
widower
lived
there
with
his
two
children
isabel
and
anthony
and
did
his
best
to
bring
them
up
in
his
own
religious
principles
he
was
a
devout
and
cultivated
puritan
who
had
been
affected
by
the
new
learning
in
his
youth
and
had
conformed
joyfully
to
the
religious
changes
that
took
place
in
reign
he
had
suffered
both
anxiety
and
hardships
in
mary
reign
when
he
had
travelled
abroad
in
the
protestant
countries
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
of
the
foreign
reformers
beza
calvin
and
even
the
great
melancthon
himself
it
was
at
this
time
too
that
he
had
lost
his
wife
it
had
been
a
great
joy
to
him
to
hear
of
the
accession
of
elizabeth
and
the
of
a
religion
that
was
sincerely
his
own
and
he
had
returned
immediately
to
england
with
his
two
little
children
and
settled
down
once
more
at
the
dower
house
here
his
whole
time
that
he
could
spare
from
his
children
was
divided
between
prayer
and
the
writing
of
a
book
on
the
eucharist
and
as
his
children
grew
up
he
more
and
more
retired
into
himself
and
silence
and
communing
with
god
and
devoted
himself
to
his
book
it
was
beginning
to
be
a
great
happiness
to
him
to
find
that
his
daughter
isabel
now
about
seventeen
years
old
was
growing
up
into
active
sympathy
with
his
principles
and
that
the
passion
of
her
soul
as
of
his
was
a
tender
faith
towards
god
which
could
exist
independently
of
outward
symbols
and
ceremonies
but
unlike
others
of
his
school
he
was
happy
too
to
notice
and
encourage
friendly
relations
between
lady
maxwell
and
his
daughter
since
he
recognised
the
sincere
and
loving
spirit
of
the
old
lady
beneath
her
superstitions
and
knew
very
well
that
her
friendship
would
do
for
the
girl
what
his
own
love
could
not
the
other
passion
of
isabel
life
at
present
lay
in
her
brother
anthony
who
was
about
three
years
younger
than
herself
and
who
was
just
now
more
interested
in
his
falcons
and
pony
than
in
all
the
religious
systems
and
human
relationships
in
the
world
except
perhaps
in
his
friendship
for
hubert
who
besides
being
three
or
four
years
older
than
himself
cared
for
the
same
things
and
so
relations
between
the
hall
and
the
dower
house
were
all
that
they
should
be
and
the
path
that
ran
through
the
gardens
of
the
one
and
the
yew
hedge
and
orchard
of
the
other
was
almost
as
well
trodden
as
if
all
still
formed
one
estate
as
for
the
village
itself
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
gauge
accurately
the
theological
atmosphere
the
rector
despaired
of
doing
so
it
was
true
that
at
easter
the
entire
population
except
the
maxwells
and
their
dependents
received
communion
in
the
parish
church
or
at
least
professed
their
willingness
and
intention
to
do
so
unless
prevented
by
some
accident
of
the
preceding
week
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
many
of
the
old
beliefs
lingered
on
and
that
there
was
little
enthusiasm
for
the
new
system
rumours
broke
out
now
and
again
that
the
catholics
were
rising
in
the
north
that
elizabeth
contemplated
a
spanish
or
french
marriage
with
a
return
to
the
old
religion
that
mary
stuart
would
yet
come
to
the
throne
and
with
each
such
report
there
came
occasionally
a
burst
of
joy
in
unsuspected
quarters
old
martin
for
example
had
been
overheard
so
a
zealous
neighbour
reported
blessing
our
lady
aloud
for
her
mercies
when
a
passing
traveller
had
insisted
that
a
religious
league
was
in
progress
of
formation
between
france
and
spain
and
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
months
as
to
when
mass
should
be
said
again
in
every
village
church
but
then
on
the
following
sunday
the
cobbler
voice
had
been
louder
than
all
in
the
metrical
psalm
and
on
the
monday
he
had
paid
a
morning
visit
to
the
rectory
to
satisfy
himself
on
the
doctrine
of
justification
and
had
gone
again
praising
god
and
not
our
lady
for
the
godly
advice
received
but
again
three
years
back
just
before
dent
had
come
to
the
place
there
had
been
a
solemn
burning
on
the
of
all
such
muniments
of
superstition
as
had
not
been
previously
hidden
by
the
priest
and
sir
nicholas
and
in
the
rejoicings
that
accompanied
this
return
to
pure
religion
practically
the
whole
agricultural
population
had
joined
some
justices
had
ridden
over
from
east
grinsted
to
direct
this
rustic
reformation
and
had
reported
favourably
to
the
new
rector
on
his
arrival
of
the
zeal
of
his
flock
the
great
rood
they
told
him
with
ss
mary
and
john
four
great
massy
angels
the
statue
of
christopher
the
vernacle
a
brocade
set
of
mass
vestments
and
a
purple
cope
had
perished
in
the
flames
and
there
had
been
no
lack
of
hands
to
carry
faggots
and
now
the
rector
found
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
zeal
of
his
parishioners
which
indeed
he
privately
regretted
with
the
sudden
and
unexpected
lapses
into
superstition
such
as
was
martin
gratitude
to
our
lady
and
others
of
which
he
had
had
experience
as
regards
the
secular
politics
of
the
outside
world
great
keynes
took
but
little
interest
it
was
far
more
a
matter
of
concern
whether
mass
or
morning
prayer
was
performed
on
sunday
than
whether
a
german
bridegroom
could
be
found
for
elizabeth
or
whether
she
would
marry
the
duke
of
anjou
and
more
important
than
either
were
the
infinitesimal
details
of
domestic
life
whether
mary
was
guilty
or
not
whether
her
supporters
were
rising
whether
the
shadow
of
spain
chilled
the
hearts
of
men
in
london
whose
affair
it
was
to
look
after
such
things
yet
the
cows
must
be
milked
and
the
children
washed
and
the
falcons
fed
and
it
was
these
things
that
formed
the
foreground
of
life
whether
the
sky
were
stormy
or
sunlit
and
so
as
the
autumn
of
crept
over
the
woods
in
flame
and
russet
and
the
sound
of
the
sickle
was
in
folks
ears
the
life
at
great
keynes
was
far
more
tranquil
than
we
should
fancy
who
look
back
on
those
stirring
days
the
village
lying
as
it
did
out
of
the
direct
route
between
any
larger
towns
was
not
so
much
affected
by
the
gallop
of
the
couriers
or
the
slow
creeping
rumours
from
the
continent
as
villages
that
lay
on
lines
of
frequent
communication
so
the
simple
life
went
on
and
isabel
went
about
her
business
in
carroll
and
anthony
rode
out
with
the
harriers
and
sir
nicholas
told
his
beads
in
his
room
all
with
nearly
as
much
serenity
as
if
scotland
were
fairyland
and
spain
a
dream
chapter
ii
the
hall
and
the
house
anthony
norris
who
was
now
about
fourteen
went
up
to
king
college
cambridge
in
october
he
was
closeted
long
with
his
father
the
night
before
he
left
and
received
from
him
much
sound
religious
advice
and
exhortation
and
in
the
morning
after
an
almost
from
isabel
he
rode
out
with
his
servant
following
on
another
horse
and
leading
a
packhorse
on
the
saddle
of
which
the
falcons
swayed
and
staggered
and
up
the
curving
drive
that
led
round
into
the
village
green
he
was
a
and
boy
and
left
a
real
ache
behind
him
in
the
dower
house
isabel
indeed
ran
up
to
his
room
after
she
had
seen
his
feathered
cap
disappear
at
a
trot
through
the
gate
leaving
her
father
in
the
hall
and
after
shutting
and
latching
the
door
threw
herself
on
his
bed
and
sobbed
her
heart
out
they
had
never
been
long
separated
before
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
gone
over
to
the
rectory
morning
by
morning
to
be
instructed
by
dent
but
now
although
he
would
never
make
a
great
scholar
his
father
thought
it
well
to
send
him
up
to
cambridge
for
two
or
three
years
that
he
might
learn
to
find
his
own
level
in
the
world
anthony
himself
was
eager
to
go
if
the
truth
must
be
told
he
fretted
a
little
against
the
restraints
of
even
such
a
moderate
puritan
household
as
that
of
his
father
it
was
a
considerable
weariness
to
anthony
to
kneel
in
the
hall
on
a
fresh
morning
while
his
father
read
even
though
with
fervour
and
sincerity
long
extracts
from
christian
prayers
and
holy
meditations
collected
by
the
reverend
henry
bull
when
the
real
world
as
anthony
knew
it
laughed
and
rippled
and
twinkled
outside
in
the
humming
summer
air
of
the
lawn
and
orchard
or
to
have
to
listen
to
godly
discourses
however
edifying
to
elder
persons
just
at
the
time
when
the
was
beginning
to
glimmer
in
the
dusk
and
the
heavy
trout
to
suck
down
his
supper
in
the
glooming
pool
in
the
meadow
below
the
house
his
very
sports
too
which
his
father
definitely
encouraged
were
obviously
displeasing
to
the
grave
divines
who
haunted
the
house
so
often
from
saturday
to
monday
and
spoke
of
high
doctrinal
matters
at
when
so
anthony
thought
lighter
subjects
should
prevail
they
were
not
interested
in
his
horse
and
anthony
never
felt
quite
the
same
again
towards
one
good
minister
who
in
a
moment
of
severity
called
eliza
the
glorious
peregrine
that
sat
on
the
boy
wrist
and
shook
her
bells
a
vanity
and
so
anthony
trotted
off
happy
enough
on
his
way
to
cambridge
of
which
he
had
heard
much
from
dent
and
where
although
there
too
were
divines
and
theology
there
were
boys
as
well
who
acted
plays
hunted
with
the
hounds
and
did
not
call
hawks
vanities
isabel
was
very
different
while
anthony
was
cheerful
and
active
like
his
mother
who
had
died
in
giving
him
life
she
on
the
other
hand
was
quiet
and
deep
like
her
father
she
was
growing
up
if
not
into
actual
beauty
at
least
into
grace
and
dignity
but
there
were
some
who
thought
her
beautiful
she
was
pale
with
dark
hair
and
the
great
grey
eyes
of
her
father
and
she
loved
and
lived
in
anthony
from
the
very
difference
between
them
she
frankly
could
not
understand
the
attraction
of
sport
and
the
things
that
pleased
her
brother
she
was
afraid
of
the
hawks
and
liked
to
stroke
a
horse
and
kiss
his
soft
nose
better
than
to
ride
him
but
after
all
anthony
liked
to
watch
the
towering
bird
and
to
hear
and
indeed
increase
the
thunder
of
the
hoofs
across
the
meadows
behind
the
stomping
hawk
and
so
she
did
her
best
to
like
them
too
and
she
was
often
torn
two
ways
by
her
sympathy
for
the
partridge
on
the
one
hand
as
it
sped
low
and
swift
across
the
standing
corn
with
that
dread
shadow
following
and
her
desire
on
the
other
hand
that
anthony
should
not
be
disappointed
but
in
the
deeper
things
of
the
spirit
too
there
was
a
wide
difference
between
them
as
anthony
fidgeted
and
sighed
through
his
morning
and
evening
isabel
soul
soared
up
to
god
on
the
wings
of
those
sounding
phrases
she
had
inherited
all
her
father
tender
piety
and
lived
like
him
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
the
spiritual
world
and
though
of
course
by
training
she
was
puritan
by
character
she
was
puritan
too
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
she
had
gone
with
anthony
to
see
the
cleansing
of
the
village
temple
they
had
stood
together
at
the
west
end
of
the
church
a
little
timid
at
the
sight
of
that
noisy
crowd
in
the
quiet
house
of
prayer
but
she
had
felt
no
disapproval
at
that
fierce
vindication
of
truth
her
father
had
taught
her
of
course
that
the
purest
worship
was
that
which
was
only
spiritual
and
while
since
childhood
she
had
seen
sunday
by
sunday
the
great
rood
overhead
she
had
never
paid
it
any
but
artistic
attention
the
men
had
the
ropes
round
it
now
and
it
was
swaying
violently
to
and
fro
and
then
even
as
the
children
watched
a
tie
had
given
and
the
great
cross
with
its
pathetic
figure
had
toppled
forward
towards
the
nave
and
then
crashed
down
on
the
pavement
a
fanatic
ran
out
and
furiously
kicked
the
head
twice
splintering
the
hair
and
the
features
and
cried
out
on
it
as
an
idol
and
yet
isabel
with
all
her
tenderness
felt
nothing
more
than
a
vague
regret
that
a
piece
of
carving
so
ancient
and
so
delicate
should
be
broken
but
when
the
work
was
over
and
the
crowd
and
anthony
with
them
had
stamped
out
directed
by
the
justices
dragging
the
figures
and
the
old
vestments
with
them
to
the
green
she
had
seen
something
which
touched
her
heart
much
more
she
passed
up
alone
under
the
screen
which
they
had
spared
to
see
what
had
been
done
in
the
chancel
and
as
she
went
she
heard
a
sobbing
from
the
corner
near
the
priest
door
and
there
crouched
forward
on
his
face
crying
and
moaning
quietly
was
the
old
priest
who
had
been
rector
of
the
church
for
nearly
twenty
years
he
had
somehow
held
on
in
edward
time
in
spite
of
difficulties
had
thanked
god
and
the
court
of
heaven
with
a
full
heart
for
the
accession
of
mary
had
prayed
and
deprecated
the
divine
wrath
at
the
return
of
the
protestant
religion
with
elizabeth
but
yet
had
somehow
managed
to
keep
the
old
faith
alight
for
eight
years
more
sometimes
evading
sometimes
resisting
and
sometimes
conforming
to
the
march
of
events
in
hopes
of
better
days
but
now
the
blow
had
fallen
and
the
old
man
too
to
hear
the
accents
of
new
truth
in
the
shouting
of
that
noisy
crowd
and
the
crash
of
his
images
was
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
where
he
had
daily
offered
the
holy
sacrifice
through
all
those
troublous
years
faithful
to
what
he
believed
to
be
god
truth
now
bewailing
and
moaning
the
horrors
of
that
day
and
it
is
to
be
feared
unchristianly
calling
down
the
vengeance
of
god
upon
his
faithless
flock
this
shocked
and
touched
isabel
far
more
than
the
destruction
of
the
images
and
she
went
forward
timidly
and
said
something
but
the
old
man
turned
on
her
a
face
of
such
misery
and
anger
that
she
had
run
straight
out
of
the
church
and
joined
anthony
as
he
danced
on
the
green
on
the
following
sunday
the
old
priest
was
not
there
and
a
fervent
young
minister
from
london
had
taken
his
place
and
preached
a
stirring
sermon
on
the
life
and
times
of
josiah
and
isabel
had
thanked
god
on
her
knees
after
the
sermon
for
that
he
had
once
more
vindicated
his
awful
name
and
cleansed
his
house
for
a
pure
worship
but
the
very
centre
of
isabel
religion
was
the
love
of
the
saviour
the
puritans
of
those
early
days
were
very
far
from
holding
a
negative
or
colourless
faith
not
only
was
their
belief
delicately
dogmatic
to
excess
but
it
all
centred
round
the
person
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
isabel
had
drunk
in
this
faith
from
her
father
lips
and
from
devotional
books
which
he
gave
her
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
anything
her
love
for
the
saviour
was
even
romantic
and
passionate
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
as
much
a
part
of
her
life
and
of
her
actual
experience
as
anthony
or
her
father
certain
places
in
the
lanes
about
and
certain
spots
in
the
garden
were
sacred
and
fragrant
to
her
because
her
lord
had
met
her
there
it
was
indeed
a
trouble
to
her
sometimes
that
she
loved
anthony
so
much
and
to
her
mind
it
was
a
less
worthy
kind
of
love
altogether
it
was
kindled
and
quickened
by
such
little
external
details
by
the
sight
of
his
boyish
hand
brown
with
the
sun
and
scarred
by
small
sporting
accidents
such
as
the
stroke
of
his
bird
beak
or
talons
or
by
the
very
outline
of
the
pillow
where
his
curly
head
had
rested
only
an
hour
or
two
ago
whereas
her
love
for
christ
was
a
deep
and
solemn
passion
that
seemed
to
well
not
out
of
his
comeliness
or
even
his
marred
face
or
pierced
hands
but
out
of
his
wide
encompassing
love
that
sustained
and
clasped
her
at
every
moment
of
her
conscious
attention
to
him
and
that
woke
her
soul
to
ecstasy
at
moments
of
high
communion
these
two
loves
then
one
so
earthly
one
so
heavenly
but
both
so
sweet
every
now
and
then
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
slight
conflict
in
her
heart
and
lately
a
third
seemed
to
be
rising
up
out
of
the
plane
of
sober
and
quiet
affections
such
as
she
felt
for
her
father
and
still
further
complicating
the
apparently
encountering
claims
of
love
to
god
and
man
isabel
grew
quieter
in
a
few
minutes
and
lay
still
following
anthony
with
her
imagination
along
the
lane
that
led
to
the
london
road
and
then
presently
she
heard
her
father
calling
and
went
to
the
door
to
listen
isabel
he
said
come
down
hubert
is
in
the
hall
she
called
out
that
she
would
be
down
in
a
moment
and
then
going
across
to
her
own
room
she
washed
her
face
and
came
downstairs
there
was
a
tall
lad
of
about
her
own
age
standing
near
the
open
door
that
led
into
the
garden
and
he
came
forward
nervously
as
she
entered
i
came
back
last
night
mistress
isabel
he
said
and
heard
that
anthony
was
going
this
morning
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
too
late
she
told
him
that
anthony
had
just
gone
yes
he
said
i
came
to
say
but
i
came
by
the
orchard
and
so
we
missed
one
another
isabel
asked
a
word
or
two
about
his
visit
to
the
north
and
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
about
a
rumour
that
hubert
had
heard
of
a
rising
on
behalf
of
mary
but
hubert
was
shy
and
constrained
and
isabel
was
still
a
little
tremulous
at
last
he
said
he
must
be
going
and
then
suddenly
remembered
a
message
from
his
mother
ah
he
said
i
was
forgetting
my
mother
wants
you
to
come
up
this
evening
if
you
have
time
father
is
away
and
my
aunt
is
unwell
and
is
upstairs
isabel
promised
she
would
come
father
is
at
chichester
went
on
hubert
before
the
commission
but
we
do
not
expect
him
back
till
a
shadow
passed
across
isabel
face
i
am
sorry
she
said
the
fact
was
that
sir
nicholas
had
again
been
summoned
for
recusancy
it
was
an
expensive
matter
to
refuse
to
attend
church
and
sir
nicholas
probably
paid
not
less
than
or
a
year
for
the
privilege
of
worshipping
as
his
conscience
bade
in
the
evening
isabel
asked
her
father
leave
to
be
absent
after
supper
and
then
drawing
on
her
hood
walked
across
in
the
dusk
to
the
hall
hubert
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
boundary
door
between
the
two
properties
father
has
come
back
he
said
but
my
mother
wants
you
still
they
went
on
together
passed
round
the
cloister
wing
to
the
south
of
the
house
the
bell
turret
over
the
inner
hall
and
the
crowded
roofs
stood
up
against
the
stars
as
they
came
up
the
curving
flight
of
shallow
steps
from
the
garden
to
the
tall
doorway
that
led
into
the
hall
it
was
a
pleasant
wide
high
room
panelled
with
fresh
oak
and
hung
with
a
little
old
tapestry
here
and
there
and
a
few
portraits
a
staircase
rose
out
of
it
to
the
upper
story
it
had
a
with
and
rose
pendants
and
on
the
walls
between
the
tapestries
hung
a
few
antlers
and
pieces
of
armour
morions
and
with
a
pair
of
pikes
or
halberds
here
and
there
a
fire
had
been
lighted
in
the
great
hearth
as
the
evenings
were
chilly
and
sir
nicholas
was
standing
before
it
still
in
his
pouring
out
resentment
and
fury
to
his
wife
who
sat
in
a
tall
chair
at
her
embroidery
she
turned
silently
and
held
out
a
hand
to
isabel
who
came
and
stood
beside
her
while
hubert
went
and
sat
down
near
his
father
sir
nicholas
scarcely
seemed
to
notice
their
entrance
beyond
glancing
up
for
a
moment
under
his
fierce
white
eyebrows
but
went
on
growling
out
his
wrath
he
was
a
fine
rosy
man
with
grey
moustache
and
pointed
beard
and
a
thick
head
of
hair
and
he
held
in
his
hand
his
flat
riding
cap
and
his
whip
with
which
from
time
to
time
he
cut
at
his
boot
it
was
monstrous
i
told
the
fellow
that
a
man
should
be
haled
from
his
home
like
this
to
pay
a
price
for
his
conscience
the
religion
of
my
father
and
his
father
and
all
our
fathers
was
good
enough
for
me
and
why
in
god
name
should
the
catholic
have
to
pay
who
had
never
changed
his
faith
while
every
heretic
went
free
and
then
to
that
some
stripling
of
a
clerk
told
me
that
a
religion
that
was
good
enough
for
the
grace
should
be
good
enough
for
her
loyal
subjects
too
but
my
lord
silenced
him
quickly
and
then
i
went
at
them
again
and
all
my
lord
would
do
was
to
nod
his
head
and
smile
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
then
he
told
me
that
it
was
a
special
commission
all
for
my
sake
and
sir

together

another
party
coming
in
pursuivant
and
all
and
in
the
mid
of
them
that

my

sir
arthur

we
asked

he
gave
it

and
oh
my
lord

red
and
white
with
passion
that

not
wise
sweetheart
said
lady
maxwell
tranquilly
the
priest
will
have
suffered
for
it
afterwards
well
well
grumbled
sir
nicholas
a
man
can
not
always
think
but
we
showed
them
that
catholics
were
not
ashamed
of
their
religion
yes
and
we
got
the
blessing
too
well
but
here
is
supper
waiting
said
my
lady
and
isabel
too
whom
you
have
not
spoken
to
yet
sir
nicholas
paid
no
attention
ah
but
that
was
not
all
he
went
on
savagely
striking
his
boot
again
at
the
end
of
all
who
should
i
see
but
that
that
damned
rogue
whom
god
reward
and
he
turned
and
spat
into
the
fire
topcliffe
there
he
was
bowing
to
my
lord
and
the
commissioners
when
i
think
of
that
man
he
said
when
i
think
of
that
man
and
sir
nicholas
kindly
old
passionate
face
grew
pale
and
lowering
with
fury
and
his
eyebrows
bent
themselves
forward
and
his
lower
lip
pushed
itself
out
and
his
hand
closed
tremblingly
on
his
whip
his
wife
laid
down
her
embroidery
and
came
to
him
there
sweetheart
she
said
taking
his
cap
and
whip
now
sit
down
and
have
supper
and
leave
that
man
to
god
sir
nicholas
grew
quiet
again
and
after
a
saying
a
word
or
two
of
apology
to
isabel
left
the
room
to
wash
before
he
sat
down
to
supper
mistress
isabel
does
not
know
who
topcliffe
is
said
hubert
hush
my
son
said
his
mother
your
father
does
not
like
his
name
to
be
spoken
presently
sir
nicholas
returned
and
sat
down
to
supper
gradually
his
good
nature
returned
and
he
told
them
what
he
had
seen
in
chichester
and
the
talk
he
had
heard
how
it
was
reported
to
his
lordship
the
bishop
that
the
old
religion
was
still
the
religion
of
the
people
hearts
how
for
example
at
lindfield
they
had
all
the
images
and
the
altar
furniture
hidden
underground
and
at
battle
too
and
that
the
mass
could
be
set
up
again
at
a
few
hours
notice
and
that
the
chalices
had
not
been
melted
down
into
communion
cups
according
to
the
orders
issued
and
so
on
and
that
at
west
grinsted
moreover
the
blessed
sacrament
was
there
still
praise
god
yes
and
was
going
to
remain
there
he
spoke
freely
before
isabel
and
yet
he
remembered
his
courtesy
too
and
did
not
abuse
the
religion
as
he
thought
it
in
her
presence
or
seek
in
any
way
to
trouble
her
mind
if
ever
in
an
excess
of
anger
he
was
carried
away
in
his
talk
his
wife
would
always
check
him
gently
and
he
would
always
respond
and
apologise
to
isabel
if
he
had
transgressed
good
manners
in
fact
he
was
just
a
fiery
old
man
who
could
not
change
his
religion
even
at
the
bidding
of
his
monarch
and
could
not
understand
how
what
was
right
twenty
years
ago
was
wrong
now
isabel
herself
listened
with
patience
and
tenderness
and
awe
too
because
she
loved
and
honoured
this
old
man
in
spite
of
the
darkness
in
which
he
still
walked
he
also
told
them
in
lower
tones
of
a
rumour
that
was
persistent
at
chichester
that
the
duke
of
norfolk
had
been
imprisoned
by
the
queen
orders
and
was
to
be
charged
with
treason
and
that
he
was
at
present
at
burnham
in
wentworth
house
under
the
guard
of
sir
henry
neville
if
this
was
true
as
indeed
it
turned
out
to
be
later
it
was
another
blow
to
the
catholic
cause
in
england
but
sir
nicholas
was
of
a
sanguine
mind
and
the
whole
affair
even
while
he
related
it
and
so
the
evening
passed
in
talk
when
sir
nicholas
had
finished
supper
they
all
went
upstairs
to
my
lady
on
the
first
floor
this
was
always
a
strange
and
beautiful
room
to
isabel
it
was
panelled
like
the
room
below
but
was
more
delicately
furnished
and
a
tall
harp
stood
near
the
window
to
which
my
lady
sang
sometimes
in
a
sweet
tremulous
old
voice
while
sir
nicholas
nodded
at
the
fire
isabel
too
had
had
some
lessons
here
from
the
old
lady
but
even
this
mild
vanity
troubled
her
puritan
conscience
a
little
sometimes
then
the
room
too
had
curious
and
attractive
things
in
it
a
high
niche
in
the
oak
over
the
fireplace
held
a
slender
image
of
mary
and
her
holy
child
and
from
the
child
fingers
hung
a
pair
of
beads
isabel
had
a
strange
sense
sometimes
as
if
this
holy
couple
had
taken
refuge
in
that
niche
when
they
were
driven
from
the
church
but
it
seemed
to
her
in
her
steadier
moods
that
this
was
a
superstitious
fancy
and
had
the
nature
of
sin
this
evening
the
old
lady
went
to
her
harp
while
isabel
sat
down
near
her
in
the
wide
window
seat
and
looked
out
over
the
dark
lawn
where
the
white
dial
glimmered
like
a
phantom
and
thought
of
anthony
again
sir
nicholas
went
and
stretched
himself
before
the
fire
and
closed
his
eyes
for
he
was
old
and
tired
with
his
long
ride
and
hubert
sat
down
in
a
dark
corner
near
him
whence
he
could
watch
isabel
after
a
few
rippling
chords
my
lady
began
to
sing
a
song
by
sir
thomas
wyatt
whom
she
and
sir
nicholas
had
known
in
their
youth
and
which
she
had
caused
to
be
set
to
music
by
some
foreign
chapel
master
it
was
a
sorrowful
little
song
with
the
title
he
seeketh
comfort
in
patience
and
possibly
she
chose
it
on
purpose
for
this
evening
patience
for
i
have
wrong
and
dare
not
shew
wherein
patience
shall
be
my
song
since
truth
can
nothing
win
patience
then
for
this
fit
hereafter
comes
not
yet
while
she
sang
she
thought
no
doubt
of
the
foolish
brave
courtier
who
lacked
patience
in
spite
of
his
singing
and
lost
his
head
for
it
her
voice
shook
once
or
twice
and
old
sir
nicholas
shook
his
drowsy
head
when
she
had
finished
and
said
god
rest
him
and
then
fell
fast
asleep
then
he
presently
awoke
as
the
others
talked
in
whispers
and
joined
in
too
and
they
talked
of
anthony
and
what
he
would
find
at
cambridge
and
of
alderman
marrett
and
his
house
off
cheapside
where
anthony
would
lie
that
night
and
of
such
small
and
tranquil
topics
and
left
fiercer
questions
alone
and
so
the
evening
came
to
an
end
and
isabel
said
and
went
downstairs
with
hubert
and
out
into
the
garden
again
i
am
sorry
that
sir
nicholas
has
been
so
troubled
she
said
to
hubert
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
together
why
can
not
we
leave
one
another
alone
and
each
worship
god
as
we
think
fit
hubert
smiled
in
the
darkness
to
himself
i
am
afraid
queen
mary
did
not
think
it
could
be
done
either
he
said
but
then
mistress
isabel
he
went
on
i
am
glad
that
you
feel
that
religion
should
not
divide
people
surely
not
she
said
so
long
as
they
love
god
then
you
think
began
hubert
and
then
stopped
isabel
turned
to
him
yes
she
asked
nothing
said
hubert
they
had
reached
the
door
in
the
boundary
wall
by
now
and
isabel
would
not
let
him
come
further
with
her
and
bade
him
but
hubert
still
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
door
and
watched
the
white
figure
fade
into
the
dusk
and
listened
to
the
faint
rustle
of
her
skirt
over
the
dry
leaves
and
then
when
he
heard
at
last
the
door
of
the
dower
house
open
and
close
he
sighed
to
himself
and
went
home
isabel
heard
her
father
call
from
his
room
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
and
went
in
to
him
as
he
sat
at
his
table
in
his
furred
gown
with
his
books
about
him
to
bid
him
and
receive
his
blessing
he
lifted
his
hand
for
a
moment
to
finish
the
sentence
he
was
writing
and
she
stood
watching
the
quill
move
and
pause
and
move
again
over
the
paper
in
the
candlelight
until
he
laid
the
pen
down
and
rose
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
smiling
down
at
her
he
was
a
tall
slender
man
surprisingly
upright
for
his
age
with
a
delicate
bearded
scholar
face
the
little
plain
ruff
round
his
neck
helped
to
emphasise
the
fine
sensitiveness
of
his
features
and
the
hands
which
he
stretched
out
to
his
daughter
were
thin
and
veined
well
my
daughter
he
said
looking
down
at
her
with
his
kindly
grey
eyes
so
like
her
own
and
holding
her
hands
have
you
had
a
good
evening
sir
she
asked
he
nodded
briskly
and
you
child
he
asked
yes
sir
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
and
was
sir
nicholas
there
she
told
him
what
had
passed
and
how
sir
nicholas
had
been
fined
again
for
his
recusancy
and
how
lady
maxwell
had
sung
one
of
sir
thomas
wyatt
songs
and
was
no
one
else
there
he
asked
yes
father
hubert
ah
and
did
hubert
come
home
with
you
only
as
far
as
the
gate
father
i
would
not
let
him
come
further
her
father
said
nothing
but
still
looked
steadily
down
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
and
looked
away
from
her
into
the
fire
you
must
take
care
he
said
gently
remember
he
is
a
papist
born
and
bred
and
that
he
has
a
heart
to
be
broken
too
she
felt
herself
steadily
flushing
and
as
he
turned
again
towards
her
dropped
her
eyes
you
will
be
prudent
and
tender
i
know
he
added
i
trust
you
wholly
isabel
then
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
looked
up
as
the
puritan
manner
was
may
the
god
of
grace
bless
you
my
daughter
and
make
you
faithful
to
the
end
and
then
he
looked
into
her
eyes
again
smiled
and
nodded
and
she
went
out
leaving
him
standing
there
norris
had
begun
to
fear
that
the
boy
loved
isabel
but
as
yet
he
did
not
know
whether
isabel
understood
it
or
even
was
aware
of
it
the
marriage
difficulties
of
catholics
and
protestants
were
scarcely
yet
existing
and
certainly
there
was
no
formulated
rule
of
dealing
with
them
changes
of
religion
were
so
frequent
in
those
days
that
difficulties
when
they
did
arise
easily
adjusted
themselves
it
was
considered
for
example
by
politicians
quite
possible
at
one
time
that
the
duke
of
anjou
should
conform
to
the
church
of
england
for
the
sake
of
marrying
the
queen
or
that
he
should
attend
public
services
with
her
and
at
the
same
time
have
mass
and
the
sacraments
in
his
own
private
chapel
or
again
it
was
open
to
question
whether
england
as
a
whole
would
not
return
to
the
old
religion
and
catholicism
be
the
only
tolerated
faith
but
to
really
religious
minds
such
solutions
would
not
do
it
would
have
been
an
intolerable
thought
to
this
sincere
puritan
with
all
his
tolerance
that
his
daughter
should
marry
a
catholic
such
an
arrangement
would
mean
either
that
she
was
indifferent
to
vital
religion
or
that
she
was
married
to
a
man
whose
creed
she
was
bound
to
abhor
and
anathematise
and
however
willing
norris
might
be
to
meet
papists
on
terms
of
social
friendliness
and
however
much
he
might
respect
their
personal
characters
yet
the
thought
that
the
life
of
any
one
dear
to
him
should
be
irretrievably
bound
up
with
all
that
the
catholic
creed
involved
was
simply
an
impossible
one
besides
all
this
he
had
no
great
opinion
of
hubert
he
thought
he
detected
in
him
a
carelessness
and
want
of
principle
that
would
make
him
hesitate
to
trust
his
daughter
to
him
even
if
the
insuperable
barrier
of
religion
were
surmounted
norris
liked
a
man
to
be
consistent
and
zealous
for
his
creed
even
if
that
creed
were
dark
and
superstitious
and
this
zeal
seemed
to
him
lamentably
lacking
in
hubert
more
than
once
he
had
heard
the
boy
speak
of
his
father
with
an
air
of
easy
indulgence
that
his
own
opinion
interpreted
as
contempt
i
believe
my
father
thinks
he
had
once
said
that
every
penny
he
pays
in
fines
goes
to
swell
the
accidental
glory
of
god
and
hubert
had
been
considerably
startled
and
distressed
when
the
elder
man
had
told
him
to
hold
his
tongue
unless
he
could
speak
respectfully
of
one
to
whom
he
owed
nothing
but
love
and
honour
this
had
happened
however
more
than
a
year
ago
and
hubert
had
forgotten
it
no
doubt
even
if
norris
had
not
and
as
for
isabel
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
say
quite
what
place
hubert
occupied
in
her
mind
she
certainly
did
not
know
herself
much
more
than
that
she
liked
the
boy
to
be
near
her
to
hear
his
footsteps
coming
along
the
path
from
the
hall
this
morning
when
her
father
had
called
up
to
her
that
hubert
was
come
it
was
not
so
hard
to
dry
her
tears
for
departure
the
clouds
had
parted
a
little
when
she
came
and
found
this
tall
lad
smiling
shyly
at
her
in
the
hall
as
she
had
sat
in
the
window
seat
too
during
lady
maxwell
singing
she
was
far
from
unconscious
that
hubert
face
was
looking
at
her
from
the
dark
corner
and
as
they
walked
back
together
her
simplicity
was
not
quite
so
transparent
as
the
boy
himself
thought
again
when
her
father
had
begun
to
speak
of
him
just
now
although
she
was
able
to
meet
his
eyes
steadily
and
smilingly
yet
it
was
just
an
effort
she
had
not
mentioned
hubert
herself
until
her
father
had
named
him
and
in
fact
it
is
probably
safe
to
say
that
during
hubert
visit
to
the
north
which
had
lasted
three
or
four
months
he
had
made
greater
progress
towards
his
goal
and
had
begun
to
loom
larger
than
ever
in
the
heart
of
this
serene
girl
whom
he
longed
for
so
irresistibly
and
now
as
isabel
sat
on
her
bed
before
kneeling
to
say
her
prayers
hubert
was
in
her
mind
even
more
than
anthony
she
tried
to
wonder
what
her
father
meant
and
yet
only
too
well
she
knew
that
she
knew
she
had
forgotten
to
look
into
anthony
room
where
she
had
cried
so
bitterly
this
morning
and
now
she
sat
and
as
to
whether
her
heavenly
love
were
as
lucid
and
single
as
it
had
been
and
when
at
last
she
went
down
on
her
knees
she
entreated
the
king
of
love
to
bless
not
only
her
father
and
her
brother
anthony
who
lay
under
the
alderman
roof
in
london
but
sir
nicholas
and
lady
maxwell
and
mistress
margaret
hallam
and
and
hubert
and
james
maxwell
his
brother
and
to
bring
them
out
of
the
darkness
of
papistry
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
the
gospel
chapter
iii
london
town
isabel
visit
to
london
which
had
been
arranged
to
take
place
the
christmas
after
anthony
departure
to
cambridge
was
full
of
bewildering
experiences
to
her
norris
from
time
to
time
had
references
to
look
up
in
london
and
divines
to
consult
as
to
difficult
points
in
his
book
on
the
eucharist
and
this
was
a
favourable
opportunity
to
see
dering
the
paul
lecturer
so
the
two
took
the
opportunity
and
with
a
couple
of
servants
drove
up
to
the
city
one
day
early
in
december
to
the
house
of
alderman
marrett
the
wool
merchant
and
a
friend
of
norris
father
and
for
several
days
both
before
and
after
arrival
from
cambridge
went
every
afternoon
to
see
the
sights
the
maze
of
narrow
streets
of
high
black
and
white
houses
with
their
signs
leaning
forward
as
if
to
whisper
to
one
another
leaving
strips
of
sky
overhead
the
strange
play
of
lights
and
shades
after
nightfall
the
fantastic
groups
the
incessant
roar
and
rumble
of
the
crowded
alleys
all
the
commonplace
life
of
london
was
like
an
enchanted
picture
to
her
opening
a
glimpse
into
an
existence
of
which
she
had
known
nothing
to
live
too
in
the
whirl
of
news
that
poured
in
day
after
day
borne
by
splashed
riders
and
panting
horses
this
was
very
different
to
the
slow
round
of
country
life
with
rumours
and
tales
floating
in
mellowed
by
doubt
and
lapse
of
time
like
pensive
echoes
from
another
world
for
example
morning
by
morning
as
she
came
downstairs
to
dinner
there
was
the
alderman
with
his
fresh
budget
of
news
of
the
north
lords
northumberland
and
westmoreland
with
a
catholic
force
of
several
thousands
among
which
were
two
cousins
of
marrett
herself
and
the
old
lady
nodded
her
head
dolorously
in
corroboration
had
marched
southwards
under
the
banner
of
the
five
wounds
and
tramped
through
durham
city
welcomed
by
hundreds
of
the
citizens
the
cathedral
had
been
entered
old
richard
norton
with
the
banner
leading
the
new
communion
table
had
been
cast
out
of
doors
the
english
bible
and
torn
to
shreds
the
old
altar
reverently
carried
in
from
the
rubbish
heap
the
tapers
rekindled
and
amid
hysterical
enthusiasm
mass
had
been
said
once
more
in
the
old
sanctuary
then
they
had
moved
south
lord
sussex
was
powerless
in
york
the
queen
terrified
and
irresolute
alternately
storming
and
crying
spain
was
about
to
send
ships
to
hartlepool
to
help
the
rebels
mary
stuart
would
certainly
be
rescued
from
her
prison
at
tutbury
then
mary
had
been
moved
to
coventry
then
came
a
last
flare
of
frightening
tales
york
had
fallen
mary
had
escaped
elizabeth
was
preparing
to
flee
and
then
one
morning
the
alderman
face
was
brighter
it
was
all
a
lie
he
said
the
revolt
had
crumbled
away
my
lord
sussex
was
impregnably
fortified
in
york
with
guns
from
hull
lord
pembroke
was
gathering
forces
at
windsor
lords
clinton
hereford
and
warwick
were
converging
towards
york
to
relieve
the
siege
and
as
if
to
show
isabel
it
was
not
a
mere
romance
she
could
see
the
actual
go
by
up
cheapside
with
the
gleam
of
steel
caps
and
and
the
mighty
tramp
of
disciplined
feet
and
the
welcoming
roar
of
the
swarming
crowds
then
as
men
hearts
grew
lighter
the
tale
of
chastisement
began
to
be
told
and
was
not
finished
till
long
after
isabel
was
home
again
green
after
green
of
the
windy
northern
villages
was
made
hideous
by
the
hanging
bodies
of
the
natives
and
children
hid
their
faces
and
ran
by
lest
they
should
see
what
her
grace
had
done
to
their
father
in
spite
of
the
holy
sacrifice
and
the
piteous
banner
and
the
call
to
fight
for
the
faith
the
catholics
had
hung
back
and
hesitated
and
the
catastrophe
was
complete
the
religion
of
london
too
was
a
revelation
to
this
country
girl
she
went
one
sunday
to
paul
cathedral
pausing
with
her
father
before
they
went
in
to
see
the
new
restorations
and
the
truncated
steeple
struck
by
lightning
eight
years
before
which
in
spite
of
the
queen
angry
urging
the
citizens
had
never
been
able
to
replace
there
was
a
good
congregation
at
the
early
morning
prayer
and
the
organs
and
the
singing
were
to
isabel
as
the
harps
and
choirs
of
heaven
the
canticles
were
sung
to
shephard
setting
by
the
men
and
children
of
paul
all
in
surplices
and
the
dignitaries
wore
besides
their
grey
fur
almuces
which
had
not
yet
been
abolished
the
grace
and
dignity
of
the
whole
service
though
to
older
people
who
remembered
the
unreformed
worship
a
bare
and
miserable
affair
and
to
norris
with
his
sincere
simplicity
and
spirituality
a
somewhat
elaborate
and
sensuous
mode
of
honouring
god
yet
to
isabel
was
a
first
glimpse
of
what
the
mystery
of
worship
meant
the
dim
towering
arches
through
which
the
dusty
sunbeams
poured
the
murmurous
melodies
that
floated
down
from
the
glimmering
choir
the
high
thin
pealing
organ
all
combined
to
give
her
a
sense
of
the
unfathomable
depths
of
the
divine
majesty
an
element
that
was
lacking
in
the
personal
puritan
creed
in
spite
of
the
tender
associations
that
made
it
fragrant
for
her
and
the
love
of
the
saviour
that
enlightened
and
warmed
it
the
sight
of
the
crowds
outside
too
in
the
frosty
sunlight
gathered
round
the
grey
stone
pulpit
on
the
of
the
cathedral
and
streaming
down
every
alley
and
lane
the
packed
galleries
the
gesticulating
black
figure
of
the
preacher
this
impressed
on
her
an
idea
of
the
power
of
corporate
religion
that
hours
at
her
own
or
solitary
twilight
walks
under
the
hall
pines
or
the
uneventful
divisions
of
the
rector
village
sermons
had
failed
to
give
it
was
this
sunday
in
london
that
awakened
her
quiet
soul
from
the
lonely
companionship
of
god
to
the
knowledge
of
that
vast
spiritual
world
of
men
of
which
she
was
but
one
tiny
cell
her
father
observed
her
quietly
and
interestedly
as
they
went
home
together
but
said
nothing
beyond
an
indifferent
word
or
two
he
was
beginning
to
realise
the
serious
reality
of
her
spiritual
life
and
to
dread
anything
that
would
even
approximate
to
coming
between
her
soul
and
her
saviour
the
father
and
daughter
understood
one
another
and
were
content
to
be
silent
together
her
talks
with
marrett
too
left
their
traces
on
her
mind
the
alderman
wife
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
found
her
views
and
reminiscences
listened
to
as
if
they
were
oracles
and
she
needed
little
encouragement
to
pour
them
out
in
profusion
she
was
especially
generous
with
her
tales
of
portents
and
warnings
and
the
girl
was
more
than
once
considerably
alarmed
by
what
she
heard
while
the
ladies
were
alone
in
the
dim
firelit
parlour
on
the
winter
afternoons
before
the
candles
were
brought
in
when
you
were
a
little
child
my
dear
began
the
old
lady
one
day
there
was
a
great
burning
made
everywhere
of
all
the
popish
images
and
vestments
all
but
the
copes
and
the
that
they
made
into
dresses
for
the
ministers
new
wives
and
to
cover
them
and
there
were
books
and
banners
and
sepulchres
and
even
relics
i
went
out
to
see
the
burning
at
paul
and
though
i
knew
it
was
proper
that
the
old
papistry
should
go
yet
i
was
uneasy
at
the
way
it
was
done
well
went
on
the
old
lady
glancing
about
her
i
was
sitting
in
this
very
room
only
a
few
days
after
and
the
air
began
to
grow
dark
and
heavy
and
all
became
still
there
had
been
two
or
three
cocks
crowing
and
answering
one
another
down
by
the
river
and
others
at
a
distance
and
they
all
ceased
and
there
had
been
birds
chirping
in
the
roof
and
they
ceased
and
it
grew
so
dark
that
i
laid
down
my
needle
and
went
to
the
window
and
there
at
the
end
of
the
street
over
the
houses
there
was
coming
a
great
cloud
with
wings
like
a
hawk
i
thought
but
some
said
afterwards
that
when
they
saw
it
it
had
fingers
like
a
man
hand
and
others
said
it
was
like
a
great
tower
with
battlements
however
that
may
be
it
grew
nearer
and
larger
and
it
was
blue
and
dark
like
that
curtain
there
and
there
was
no
wind
to
stir
it
for
the
windows
had
ceased
rattling
and
the
dust
was
quiet
in
the
streets
and
still
it
came
on
quickly
growing
as
it
came
and
then
there
came
a
sound
like
a
heavy
waggon
or
some
said
like
a
deep
voice
complaining
and
i
turned
away
from
the
window
afraid
and
there
was
the
cat
that
had
been
on
a
chair
down
in
the
corner
with
her
back
up
staring
at
the
cloud
and
then
she
began
to
run
round
the
room
like
a
mad
thing
and
presently
whisked
out
of
the
door
when
i
opened
it
and
i
went
to
find
marrett
and
he
had
not
come
in
and
all
the
yard
was
quiet
i
could
only
hear
a
horse
stamp
once
or
twice
in
the
stable
and
then
as
i
saw
calling
out
for
some
one
to
come
the
storm
broke
and
the
sky
was
all
one
dark
cloud
from
side
to
side
for
three
hours
it
went
on
rolling
and
clapping
and
the
lightning
came
in
through
the
window
that
i
had
darkened
and
through
the
clothes
over
my
head
for
i
had
gone
to
my
bed
and
rolled
myself
round
under
the
clothes
and
so
it
went
on
and
my
dear
and
marrett
put
her
head
close
to
isabel
i
prayed
to
our
lady
and
the
saints
which
i
had
not
done
since
i
was
married
and
asked
them
to
pray
god
to
keep
me
safe
and
then
at
the
end
came
a
clap
of
thunder
and
a
flash
of
lightning
more
fearful
than
all
that
had
gone
before
and
at
that
very
moment
so
marrett
told
me
when
he
came
in
two
of
the
doors
in
denys
church
in
fanshawe
street
were
broken
in
pieces
by
something
that
crushed
them
in
and
the
stone
steeple
of
allhallow
church
in
bread
street
was
broken
off
short
and
a
part
of
it
killed
a
dog
that
was
beneath
and
overthrew
a
man
that
played
with
the
dog
isabel
could
hardly
restrain
a
shiver
and
a
glance
round
the
dark
old
room
so
awful
were
marrett
face
and
gestures
and
loud
whispering
tone
as
she
told
this
ah
but
my
dear
she
went
on
there
was
worse
happened
to
poor
king
hal
god
rest
him
him
who
began
to
reform
the
church
as
they
say
and
destroyed
the
monasteries
all
the
money
that
he
left
for
masses
for
his
soul
was
carried
off
with
the
rest
at
the
change
of
religion
and
that
was
bad
enough
but
this
is
worse
this
is
a
tale
my
dear
that
i
have
heard
my
father
tell
many
a
time
and
i
was
a
young
woman
myself
when
it
happened
the
king
grace
was
threatened
by
a
friar
i
think
of
greenwich
that
if
he
laid
hands
on
the
monasteries
he
should
be
as
ahab
whose
blood
was
licked
by
dogs
in
the
very
place
which
he
took
from
a
man
well
the
friar
was
hanged
for
his
pains
and
the
king
lived
and
then
at
last
he
died
and
was
put
in
a
great
coffin
and
carried
through
london
and
they
put
the
coffin
in
an
open
space
in
sion
abbey
which
the
king
had
taken
and
in
the
night
there
came
one
to
view
the
coffin
and
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
he
came
round
the
corner
and
there
stood
the
great
coffin
for
his
grace
was
a
great
stout
man
my
dear
on
trestles
in
the
moonlight
and
beneath
it
a
great
black
dog
that
lapped
something
and
the
dog
turned
as
the
man
came
and
some
say
but
not
my
father
that
the
dog
eyes
were
red
as
coals
and
that
his
mouth
and
nostrils
smoked
and
that
he
cast
no
shadow
but
however
that
may
be
the
dog
turned
and
looked
and
then
ran
and
the
man
followed
him
into
a
yard
but
when
he
reached
there
there
was
no
dog
and
the
man
went
back
to
the
coffin
afraid
and
he
found
the
coffin
was
burst
open
and
and
marrett
stopped
abruptly
isabel
was
white
and
trembling
there
there
my
dear
i
am
a
foolish
old
woman
and
i
tell
you
no
more
isabel
was
really
terrified
and
entreated
marrett
to
tell
her
something
pleasant
to
make
her
forget
these
horrors
and
so
she
told
her
old
tales
of
her
youth
and
the
sights
of
the
city
and
the
great
doings
in
mary
reign
and
so
the
time
passed
pleasantly
till
the
gentlemen
came
home
at
other
times
she
told
her
of
elizabeth
and
the
great
nobles
and
isabel
heart
beat
high
at
it
and
at
the
promise
that
before
she
left
she
herself
should
see
the
queen
even
if
she
had
to
go
to
greenwich
or
nonsuch
for
it
god
bless
her
said
marrett
loyally
she
a
woman
like
ourselves
for
all
her
majesty
and
she
likes
the
show
and
the
music
too
like
us
all
i
declare
when
i
see
them
all
down
the
water
to
greenwich
or
to
the
tower
for
a
with
the
horns
blowing
and
the
guns
firing
and
the
banners
and
the
barges
and
the
music
i
declare
sometimes
i
think
that
heaven
itself
can
be
no
better
god
forgive
me
ah
but
i
wish
her
grace
take
a
husband
there
are
many
that
want
her
and
then
we
could
laugh
at
them
all
there
so
many
against
her
grace
now
be
for
her
if
she
had
a
son
of
her
own
there
duke
charles
whose
picture
hangs
in
her
bedroom
they
say
and
lord
robert
dudley
there
a
handsome
spark
my
dear
in
his
gay
coat
and
his
feathers
and
his
ruff
and
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
his
horse
and
all
i
wish
she
take
him
and
have
done
with
it
and
then
we
hear
no
more
of
the
nasty
spaniards
there
don
de
silva
for
all
the
world
like
a
monkey
with
his
brown
face
and
mincing
ways
and
his
grand
clothes
i
declare
when
captain
hawkins
came
home
just
four
years
ago
last
michaelmas
and
came
up
to
london
with
his
men
all
laughing
and
rolling
along
with
the
people
cheering
them
i
could
have
kissed
the
man
to
think
how
he
had
made
the
brown
men
dance
and
curse
and
show
their
white
teeth
and
to
think
that
the
don
had
to
ask
him
to
dinner
and
grin
and
chatter
as
if
nought
had
happened
and
marrett
face
broke
into
mirth
at
the
thought
of
the
ambassador
impotence
and
duplicity
anthony
arrival
in
london
a
few
days
before
christmas
removed
the
one
obstacle
to
isabel
satisfaction
that
he
was
not
there
to
share
it
with
her
the
two
went
about
together
most
of
the
day
under
their
care
when
he
was
not
busy
at
his
book
and
saw
all
that
was
to
be
seen
one
afternoon
as
they
were
just
leaving
the
courtyard
of
the
tower
which
they
had
been
visiting
with
a
special
order
a
slight
man
who
came
suddenly
out
of
a
doorway
of
the
white
tower
stopped
a
moment
irresolutely
and
then
came
towards
them
and
bowing
he
had
sloping
shoulders
and
a
mouth
with
a
reddish
beard
and
moustache
and
had
an
air
of
strangely
mingled
submissiveness
and
capability
his
voice
too
as
he
spoke
was
at
once
deferential
and
decided
i
ask
your
pardon
norris
he
said
perhaps
you
do
not
remember
me
i
have
seen
you
before
said
the
other
puzzled
for
a
moment
yes
sir
said
the
man
down
at
great
keynes
i
was
in
service
at
the
hall
sir
yes
yes
said
norris
i
remember
you
perfectly
lackington
is
it
not
the
man
bowed
again
i
left
about
eight
years
ago
sir
and
by
the
blessing
of
god
have
gained
a
little
post
under
the
government
but
i
wished
to
tell
you
sir
that
i
have
been
happily
led
to
change
my
religion
i
was
a
papist
sir
you
know
norris
congratulated
him
i
thank
you
sir
said
lackington
the
two
children
were
looking
at
him
and
he
turned
to
them
and
bowed
again
mistress
isabel
and
master
anthony
sir
is
it
not
i
remember
you
said
isabel
a
little
shyly
at
least
i
think
so
lackington
bowed
again
as
if
gratified
and
turned
to
their
father
if
you
are
leaving
norris
would
you
allow
me
to
walk
with
you
a
few
steps
i
have
much
i
would
like
to
ask
you
of
my
old
master
and
mistress
the
four
passed
out
together
the
two
children
in
front
and
as
they
went
lackington
asked
most
eagerly
after
the
household
at
the
hall
and
especially
after
james
for
whom
he
seemed
to
have
a
special
affection
it
is
rumoured
said
norris
that
he
is
going
abroad
indeed
sir
said
the
servant
with
a
look
of
great
interest
i
had
heard
it
too
sir
but
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
it
lackington
also
gave
many
messages
of
affection
to
others
of
the
household
to
piers
the
bailiff
and
a
couple
of
the
foresters
and
finished
by
entreating
norris
to
use
him
as
he
would
telling
him
how
anxious
he
was
to
be
of
service
to
his
friends
and
asking
to
be
entrusted
with
any
little
errands
or
commissions
in
london
that
the
country
gentleman
might
wish
performed
i
shall
count
it
sir
a
privilege
said
the
servant
and
you
shall
find
me
prompt
and
discreet
one
curious
incident
took
place
just
as
lackington
was
taking
his
leave
at
the
turning
down
into
wharf
street
a
man
hurrying
eastwards
almost
ran
against
them
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
apologising
but
his
face
changed
suddenly
and
he
spat
furiously
on
the
ground
mumbling
something
and
hurried
on
lackington
seemed
to
see
nothing
why
did
he
do
that
interrupted
norris
astonished
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
said
lackington
interrogatively
that
fellow
did
you
not
see
him
spit
at
me
i
did
not
observe
it
sir
said
the
servant
and
presently
took
his
leave
why
did
that
man
spit
at
you
father
asked
isabel
when
they
had
come
indoors
i
can
not
think
my
dear
i
have
never
seen
him
in
my
life
i
think
lackington
knew
said
anthony
with
a
shrewd
air
lackington
why
lackington
did
not
even
see
him
that
was
just
it
said
anthony
anthony
talk
about
cambridge
during
these
first
evenings
in
london
was
fascinating
to
isabel
if
not
to
their
father
too
it
concerned
of
course
himself
and
his
immediate
friends
and
dealt
with
such
subjects
as
a
good
deal
but
he
spoke
also
of
the
public
disputations
and
the
theological
champions
who
crowed
and
pecked
not
unlike
cocks
themselves
while
the
theatre
rang
with
applause
and
hooting
the
sport
was
one
of
the
most
popular
at
the
universities
at
this
time
but
above
all
his
tales
of
the
queen
visit
a
few
years
before
attracted
the
girl
for
was
she
not
to
see
the
queen
with
her
own
eyes
oh
father
said
the
lad
i
would
i
had
been
there
five
years
ago
when
she
came
master
taylor
told
me
of
it
they
acted
the
you
know
in
king
chapel
on
the
sunday
evening
master
taylor
took
a
part
i
forget
what
and
he
told
me
how
she
laughed
and
clapped
and
then
there
was
a
great
disputation
before
her
one
day
in
church
and
the
doctors
argued
i
forget
what
about
but
master
taylor
says
that
of
course
the
genevans
had
the
best
of
it
and
the
queen
spoke
too
in
latin
though
she
did
not
wish
to
but
my
lord
of
ely
persuaded
her
to
it
so
you
see
she
could
not
have
learned
it
by
heart
as
some
said
and
she
said
she
would
give
some
great
gift
to
the
university
but
master
taylor
says
they
are
still
waiting
for
it
but
it
must
come
soon
you
see
because
it
is
the
queen
grace
who
has
promised
it
but
master
taylor
says
he
hopes
she
has
forgotten
it
but
he
laughs
when
i
ask
him
what
he
means
and
says
it
again
who
is
this
master
taylor
asked
his
father
oh
he
is
a
fellow
of
king
said
anthony
and
he
told
me
about
the
provost
too
the
provost
is
half
a
papist
they
say
he
is
very
old
now
and
he
has
buried
all
the
vessels
and
the
vestments
of
the
chapel
they
say
somewhere
where
no
one
knows
and
he
hopes
the
old
religion
will
come
back
again
some
day
and
then
he
will
dig
them
up
but
that
is
papistry
and
no
one
wants
that
at
cambridge
and
others
say
that
he
is
a
papist
altogether
and
has
a
priest
in
his
house
sometimes
but
i
do
not
think
he
can
be
a
papist
because
he
was
there
when
the
queen
was
there
bowing
and
smiling
says
master
taylor
and
looking
on
the
queen
so
earnestly
as
if
he
worshipped
her
says
master
taylor
all
the
time
the
chancellor
was
talking
to
her
before
they
went
into
the
chapel
for
the
but
they
wished
they
had
kept
some
of
the
things
like
the
provost
says
master
taylor
because
they
were
much
put
to
it
when
her
grace
came
down
for
stuffs
to
cover
the
and
for
surplices
for
cecil
said
she
would
be
displeased
if
all
was
bare
and
poor
is
it
true
father
asked
anthony
breaking
off
that
the
queen
likes
popish
things
and
has
a
crucifix
and
tapers
on
the
table
in
her
chapel
ah
my
son
said
norris
smiling
you
must
ask
one
who
knows
and
what
else
happened
well
said
anthony
the
best
is
to
come
they
had
plays
you
know
the
and
one
called
before
the
queen
oh
and
she
sent
for
one
of
the
boys
they
say
and
and
kissed
him
they
say
but
i
think
that
can
not
be
true
well
my
son
go
on
oh
and
some
of
them
thought
they
would
have
one
more
play
before
she
went
but
she
had
to
go
a
long
journey
and
left
cambridge
before
they
could
do
it
and
they
went
after
her
to
to
audley
end
i
think
where
she
was
to
sleep
and
a
room
was
made
ready
and
when
all
was
prepared
though
her
grace
was
tired
she
came
in
to
see
the
play
master
taylor
was
not
there
he
said
he
would
rather
not
act
in
that
one
but
he
had
the
story
from
one
who
acted
but
no
one
knew
he
said
who
wrote
the
play
well
when
the
queen
grace
was
seated
the
actors
came
on
dressed
father
dressed
and
anthony
eyes
began
to
shine
with
amusement
as
the
catholic
bishops
in
the
tower
there
was
bonner
in
his
popish
vestments
some
they
had
from
benet
with
a
staff
and
his
tall
mitre
and
a
lamb
in
his
arms
and
he
stared
at
it
and
gnashed
his
teeth
at
it
as
he
tramped
in
and
then
came
the
others
all
like
bishops
all
in
or
cloth
cut
to
look
like
them
and
then
at
the
end
came
a
dog
that
belonged
to
one
of
them
with
the
popish
host
in
his
mouth
made
large
and
white
so
that
all
could
see
what
it
was
well
they
thought
the
queen
would
laugh
as
she
was
a
protestant
but
no
one
laughed
some
one
said
something
in
the
room
and
a
lady
cried
out
and
then
the
queen
stood
up
and
scolded
the
actors
and
trounced
them
well
with
her
tongue
she
did
and
said
she
was
displeased
and
then
out
she
went
with
all
her
ladies
and
gentlemen
after
her
except
one
or
two
servants
who
put
out
the
lights
at
once
without
waiting
and
broke
bonner
staff
and
took
away
the
host
and
kicked
the
dog
and
told
them
to
be
off
for
the
queen
grace
was
angered
with
them
and
so
they
had
to
get
back
to
cambridge
in
the
dark
as
well
as
they
might
oh
the
poor
boys
said
marrett
and
they
did
it
all
to
please
her
grace
too
yes
said
the
alderman
but
the
queen
thought
it
enough
i
dare
say
to
put
the
bishops
in
prison
without
allowing
boys
to
make
a
mock
of
them
and
their
faith
before
her
yes
said
anthony
i
thought
that
was
it
when
the
alderman
came
in
a
day
or
two
later
with
the
news
that
elizabeth
was
to
come
up
from
nonsuch
the
next
day
and
to
pass
down
cheapside
on
her
way
to
greenwich
the
excitement
of
isabel
and
anthony
was
indescribable
cheapside
was
joyous
to
see
as
the
two
with
their
father
behind
them
talking
to
a
minister
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
sat
at
a
window
soon
after
waiting
to
see
the
queen
go
by
many
of
the
people
had
hung
carpets
or
tapestries
some
of
taffetas
and
out
of
their
balconies
and
windows
and
the
very
signs
themselves
fantastic
ironwork
with
here
and
there
a
grotesque
beast
rampant
or
a
bright
painting
or
an
escutcheon
with
the
gay
crowds
beneath
and
the
strip
of
frosty
blue
sky
crossed
by
streamers
from
side
to
side
shining
above
the
towering
eaves
and
gables
of
the
houses
all
combined
to
make
a
scene
so
astonishing
that
it
seemed
scarcely
real
to
these
country
children
it
was
yet
some
time
before
she
was
expected
but
there
came
a
sudden
stir
from
the
upper
end
of
cheapside
and
then
a
burst
of
cheering
and
laughter
and
hoots
anthony
leaned
out
to
see
what
was
coming
but
could
make
out
nothing
beyond
the
head
of
a
horse
and
a
man
driving
it
from
the
seat
of
a
cart
coming
slowly
down
the
centre
of
the
road
the
laughter
and
noise
grew
louder
as
the
crowds
swayed
this
way
and
that
to
make
room
presently
it
was
seen
that
behind
the
cart
a
little
space
was
kept
and
anthony
made
out
the
grey
head
of
a
man
at
the
tail
of
the
cart
and
the
face
of
another
a
little
way
behind
then
at
last
as
the
cart
jolted
past
the
two
children
saw
a
man
stripped
to
the
waist
his
hands
tied
before
him
to
the
cart
his
back
one
red
wound
while
a
hangman
walked
behind
whirling
his
thonged
whip
about
his
head
and
bringing
it
down
now
and
again
on
the
old
man
back
at
each
lash
the
prisoner
shrank
away
and
turned
his
piteous
face
drawn
with
pain
from
side
to
side
while
the
crowd
yelled
and
laughed
what
it
for
what
it
for
inquired
anthony
eager
and
interested
a
boy
leaning
from
the
next
window
answered
him
he
said
jesus
christ
was
not
in
heaven
at
that
moment
a
humorist
near
the
cart
began
to
cry
out
way
for
the
king
grace
way
for
the
king
grace
and
the
crowd
took
the
idea
instantly
a
few
men
walking
with
the
cart
formed
lines
like
gentlemen
ushers
uncovering
their
heads
and
all
crying
out
the
same
words
and
one
eager
player
tried
to
walk
backwards
until
he
was
tripped
up
and
so
the
dismal
pageant
of
this
king
of
anguish
went
by
and
the
hoots
and
shouts
of
his
heralds
died
away
anthony
turned
to
isabel
exultant
and
interested
why
isabel
he
said
you
look
all
white
what
is
it
you
know
he
a
blasphemer
i
know
i
know
said
isabel
then
suddenly
far
away
came
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
gusts
of
distant
cheering
like
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
thick
foliage
anthony
leaned
out
again
and
an
excited
murmur
broke
out
once
more
as
all
faces
turned
westwards
a
moment
more
and
anthony
caught
a
flash
of
colour
from
the
corner
near
paul
churchyard
then
the
shrill
trumpets
sounded
nearer
and
the
cheering
broke
out
at
the
end
and
ran
down
the
street
like
a
wave
of
noise
from
every
window
faces
leaned
out
even
on
the
roofs
and
between
the
high
chimney
pots
were
swaying
figures
masses
of
colour
now
began
to
emerge
with
the
glitter
of
steel
round
the
bend
of
the
street
where
the
winter
sunshine
fell
and
the
crowds
began
to
surge
back
and
against
the
houses
at
first
anthony
could
make
out
little
but
two
moving
rippling
lines
of
light
coming
parallel
pressing
the
people
back
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
come
opposite
the
window
that
he
could
make
out
the
steel
caps
and
pikeheads
of
men
in
who
marching
two
and
two
with
a
space
between
them
led
the
procession
and
kept
the
crowds
back
there
they
went
with
immovable
disciplined
faces
grounding
their
sharply
now
and
again
caring
nothing
for
the
yelp
of
pain
that
sometimes
followed
immediately
behind
them
came
the
aldermen
in
scarlet
on
black
horses
that
tossed
their
jingling
heads
as
they
walked
anthony
watched
the
solemn
faces
of
the
old
gentlemen
with
a
good
deal
of
awe
and
presently
made
out
his
friend
marrett
who
rode
near
the
end
but
who
was
too
much
engrossed
in
the
management
of
his
horse
to
notice
the
two
children
who
cried
out
to
him
and
waved
the
followed
and
then
two
lines
again
of
walking
carrying
wands
in
short
cloaks
and
elaborate
ruffs
but
the
lad
saw
little
of
them
for
the
splendour
of
the
lords
and
knights
that
followed
eclipsed
them
altogether
the
knights
came
first
in
steel
armour
with
raised
vizors
the
horses
too
in
armour
moving
sedately
with
a
splendid
clash
of
steel
and
twinkling
fiercely
in
the
sunshine
and
then
after
them
and
anthony
drew
his
breath
swiftly
came
a
blaze
of
colour
and
jewels
as
the
great
lords
in
their
cloaks
and
feathered
caps
and
gemmed
came
on
their
splendid
horses
the
crowd
yelled
and
cheered
and
great
names
were
tossed
to
and
fro
as
the
owners
passed
on
each
talking
to
his
fellow
as
if
unconscious
of
the
tumult
and
even
of
the
presence
of
these
shouting
thousands
the
cry
of
the
trumpets
rang
out
again
high
and
shattering
as
the
trumpeters
and
heralds
in
rich
came
next
and
anthony
looked
a
moment
fascinated
by
the
lions
and
lilies
and
the
brightness
of
the
eloquent
horns
before
he
turned
his
head
to
see
the
lord
mayor
himself
mounted
on
a
great
stately
white
horse
that
needed
no
management
while
his
rider
bore
on
a
cushion
the
sceptre
ah
she
was
coming
near
now
the
two
saw
nothing
of
the
next
rider
who
carried
aloft
the
glittering
sword
of
state
for
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
six
plumed
heads
of
the
horses
with
grooms
and
footmen
in
and
venetian
hose
and
the
great
gilt
open
carriage
behind
that
swayed
and
jolted
over
the
cobbles
she
was
here
she
was
here
and
the
loyal
crowds
yelled
and
surged
to
and
fro
and
cloths
and
handkerchiefs
flapped
and
waved
and
caps
tossed
up
and
down
as
at
last
the
great
creaking
carriage
came
under
the
window
this
is
what
they
saw
in
it
a
figure
of
extraordinary
dignity
sitting
upright
and
stiff
like
a
pagan
idol
dressed
in
a
magnificent
and
fantastic
purple
robe
with
a
great
double
ruff
like
a
huge
collar
behind
her
head
a
long
taper
waist
voluminous
skirts
spread
all
over
the
cushions
embroidered
with
curious
figures
and
creatures
over
her
shoulders
but
opened
in
front
so
as
to
show
the
ropes
of
pearls
and
the
blaze
of
jewels
on
the
stomacher
was
a
purple
velvet
mantle
lined
with
ermine
with
pearls
sewn
into
it
here
and
there
set
far
back
on
her
head
over
a
pile
of
hair
drawn
tightly
back
from
the
forehead
was
a
hat
with
curled
brims
elaborately
embroidered
with
the
jewelled
outline
of
a
little
crown
in
front
and
a
high
feather
topping
all
and
her
face
a
long
oval
pale
and
transparent
in
complexion
with
a
sharp
chin
and
a
high
forehead
high
arched
eyebrows
auburn
but
a
little
darker
than
her
hair
her
mouth
was
small
rising
at
the
corners
with
thin
curved
lips
tightly
shut
and
her
eyes
which
were
clear
in
colour
looked
incessantly
about
her
with
great
liveliness
and
there
was
something
overpowering
to
these
two
children
who
looked
too
awed
to
cheer
in
this
formidable
figure
in
the
barbaric
dress
the
gorgeous
climax
of
a
gorgeous
pageant
apart
from
the
physical
splendour
this
solitary
glittering
creature
represented
so
much
it
was
the
incarnate
genius
of
the
laughing
brutal
wanton
english
nation
that
sat
here
in
the
gilded
carriage
and
smiled
and
glanced
with
tight
lips
and
clear
eyes
she
was
like
some
emblematic
giant
moving
in
a
processional
car
as
fantastic
as
itself
dominant
and
serene
above
the
heads
of
the
maddened
crowds
on
to
some
mysterious
destiny
a
sovereign
however
personally
inglorious
has
such
a
dignity
in
some
measure
and
elizabeth
added
to
this
an
exceptional
majesty
of
her
own
henry
would
not
have
been
ashamed
for
this
daughter
of
his
what
wonder
then
that
these
crowds
were
delirious
with
love
and
loyalty
and
an
exultant
fear
as
this
overwhelming
personality
went
by
this
tranquil
virgin
queen
passionate
wanton
outspoken
and
absolutely
fearless
with
a
sufficient
reserve
of
will
to
be
fickle
without
weakness
and
sufficient
grasp
of
her
aims
to
be
indifferent
to
her
policy
untouched
by
vital
religion
financially
shrewd
inordinately
vain
and
when
this
strange
dominant
creature
royal
by
character
as
by
birth
as
strong
as
her
father
and
as
wanton
as
her
mother
sat
in
ermine
and
velvet
and
pearls
in
a
royal
carriage
with
wits
and
lovers
and
solemn
statesmen
and
great
nobles
vacuous
and
gallant
glittering
and
jingling
before
her
and
troops
of
tall
ladies
in
ruff
and
crimson
mantle
riding
on
white
horses
behind
and
when
the
fanfares
went
shattering
down
the
street
vibrating
through
the
continuous
roar
of
the
crowd
and
the
shrill
cries
of
children
and
the
mellow
thunder
of
rocking
overhead
and
the
endless
tramp
of
a
thousand
feet
below
and
when
the
whole
was
framed
in
this
fantastic
twisted
street
blazing
with
tapestries
and
arched
with
gables
and
banners
all
bathed
in
glory
by
the
clear
frosty
sunshine
it
is
little
wonder
that
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
this
country
boy
felt
that
here
at
last
was
the
incarnation
of
his
dreams
and
that
his
heart
should
exult
with
an
enthusiasm
he
could
not
interpret
for
the
cause
of
a
people
who
could
produce
such
a
queen
and
of
a
queen
who
could
rule
such
a
people
and
that
his
imagination
should
be
fired
with
a
sudden
sense
that
these
were
causes
for
which
the
sacrifice
of
a
life
would
be
counted
cheap
if
they
might
thereby
be
furthered
yet
in
this
very
moment
by
one
of
those
mysterious
suggestions
that
rise
from
the
depth
of
a
soul
the
image
sprang
into
his
mind
and
poised
itself
there
for
an
instant
of
the
man
who
had
passed
half
an
hour
ago
sobbing
and
shrinking
at
the
cart
tail
chapter
iv
mary
corbet
the
spring
that
followed
the
visit
to
london
passed
uneventfully
at
great
keynes
to
all
outward
appearances
and
yet
for
isabel
they
were
significant
months
in
spite
of
herself
and
of
the
word
of
warning
from
her
father
her
relations
with
hubert
continued
to
draw
closer
for
one
thing
he
had
been
the
first
to
awaken
in
her
the
consciousness
that
she
was
lovable
in
herself
and
the
mirror
that
first
tells
that
to
a
soul
always
has
something
of
the
glow
of
the
discovery
resting
upon
it
then
again
his
deference
and
his
chivalrous
air
had
a
strange
charm
when
isabel
rode
out
alone
with
anthony
she
often
had
to
catch
the
swinging
gate
as
he
rode
through
after
opening
it
and
do
such
little
things
for
herself
but
when
hubert
was
with
them
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
and
once
more
he
appealed
to
her
pity
and
this
was
the
most
subtle
element
of
all
there
was
no
doubt
that
hubert
relations
with
his
fiery
old
father
became
strained
sometimes
and
it
was
extraordinarily
sweet
to
isabel
to
be
made
a
confidant
and
yet
hubert
never
went
beyond
a
certain
point
his
wooing
was
very
skilful
and
he
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
her
uneasiness
almost
before
she
was
conscious
of
it
herself
and
to
relapse
in
a
moment
into
frank
and
brotherly
relations
again
he
came
in
one
night
after
supper
flushed
and
and
found
her
alone
in
the
hall
and
broke
out
immediately
striding
up
and
down
as
she
sat
and
watched
him
i
can
not
bear
it
there
is
bailey
who
has
been
with
us
all
lent
he
is
always
interfering
in
my
affairs
and
he
has
no
charity
i
know
i
am
a
catholic
and
that
but
when
he
and
my
father
talk
against
the
protestants
mistress
isabel
i
can
not
bear
it
they
were
abusing
the
queen
at
least
he
added
for
he
had
no
intention
to
exaggerate
they
were
saying
she
was
a
true
daughter
of
her
father
and
sneers
of
that
kind
and
i
am
an
englishman
and
her
subject
and
i
said
so
and
bailey
snapped
out
you
are
also
a
catholic
my
son
and
then
and
then
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
that
the
catholic
religion
seemed
no
better
than
any
other
for
the
good
it
did
people
and
that
the
rector
and
norris
seemed
to
me
as
good
men
as
any
one
and
of
course
i
meant
him
and
he
knew
it
and
then
he
told
me
before
the
servants
that
i
was
speaking
against
the
faith
and
then
i
said
i
would
sooner
speak
against
the
faith
than
against
good
christians
and
then
he
flamed
up
scarlet
and
i
saw
i
had
touched
him
and
then
my
father
got
scarlet
too
and
my
mother
looked
at
me
and
my
father
told
me
to
leave
the
table
for
an
insolent
puppy
and
i
knocked
over
my
chair
and
stamped
out
and
oh
mistress
isabel
i
came
straight
here
and
he
flung
down
astride
of
a
chair
with
his
arms
on
the
back
and
dropped
his
head
on
to
them
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
hubert
even
if
he
had
been
very
clever
indeed
to
have
made
any
speech
which
would
have
touched
isabel
more
than
this
there
was
the
subtle
suggestion
that
he
had
defended
the
protestants
for
her
sake
and
there
was
the
open
defence
of
her
father
and
defiance
of
the
priests
whom
she
feared
and
distrusted
there
was
a
warm
generosity
and
frankness
running
through
it
all
and
lastly
there
was
the
sweet
flattering
implication
that
he
had
come
to
her
to
be
understood
and
quieted
and
comforted
then
when
she
tried
to
show
her
disapproval
of
his
quick
temper
and
had
succeeded
in
showing
a
poorly
disguised
sympathy
instead
he
had
flung
away
again
saying
that
she
had
brought
him
to
his
senses
as
usual
and
that
he
would
ask
the
priest
pardon
for
his
insolence
at
once
and
isabel
was
left
standing
and
looking
at
the
fire
fearing
that
she
was
being
wooed
and
yet
not
certain
though
she
loved
it
and
then
too
there
was
the
secret
hope
that
it
might
be
through
her
that
he
might
escape
from
his
superstitions
and
and
then
and
she
closed
her
eyes
and
bit
her
lip
for
joy
and
terror
she
did
not
know
that
a
few
weeks
later
hubert
had
an
interview
with
his
father
of
which
she
was
the
occasion
lady
maxwell
had
gone
to
her
husband
after
a
good
deal
of
thought
and
anxiety
and
told
him
what
she
feared
asking
him
to
say
a
word
to
hubert
sir
nicholas
had
been
startled
and
furious
it
was
all
the
lad
conceit
he
said
he
had
no
real
heart
at
all
he
only
flattered
his
vanity
in
making
love
he
had
no
love
for
his
parents
or
his
faith
and
so
on
she
took
his
old
hand
in
her
own
and
held
it
while
she
spoke
sweetheart
she
said
how
old
were
you
when
you
used
to
come
riding
to
overfield
i
forget
and
there
came
peace
into
his
angry
puzzled
old
eyes
and
a
gleam
of
humour
mistress
he
said
you
have
not
forgotten
for
he
had
been
just
eighteen
too
and
he
took
her
face
in
his
hands
delicately
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
well
well
he
said
it
is
hard
on
the
boy
but
it
must
not
go
on
send
him
to
me
oh
i
will
be
easy
with
him
but
the
interview
was
not
as
simple
as
he
hoped
for
hubert
was
irritable
and
shamefaced
and
spoke
lightly
of
the
religion
again
after
all
he
burst
out
there
are
plenty
of
good
men
who
have
left
the
faith
it
brings
nothing
but
misery
sir
nicholas
hands
began
to
shake
and
his
fingers
to
clench
themselves
but
he
remembered
the
lad
was
in
love
my
son
he
said
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
i
know
well
enough
said
hubert
with
his
foot
tapping
sharply
i
say
that
the
catholic
religion
is
a
religion
of
misery
and
death
everywhere
look
at
the
low
countries
sir
i
can
not
speak
of
that
said
his
father
and
his
son
sneered
visibly
you
and
i
are
but
laymen
but
this
i
know
and
have
a
right
to
say
that
to
threaten
me
like
that
is
the
act
of
a
is
not
worthy
of
my
son
my
dear
boy
he
said
coming
nearer
you
are
angry
and
god
forgive
me
so
am
i
but
i
promised
your
mother
and
again
he
broke
off
and
we
can
not
go
on
with
this
now
come
again
this
evening
hubert
stood
turned
away
with
his
head
against
the
high
oak
mantelpiece
and
there
was
silence
father
he
said
at
last
turning
round
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
nicholas
stepped
nearer
his
eyes
suddenly
bright
with
tears
and
his
mouth
twitching
and
held
out
his
hand
which
hubert
took
and
i
was
a
coward
to
speak
like
that
but
but
i
will
try
went
on
the
boy
and
i
promise
to
say
nothing
to
her
yet
at
any
rate
will
that
do
and
i
will
go
away
for
a
while
the
father
threw
his
arms
round
him
as
the
summer
drew
on
and
began
to
fill
the
gardens
and
meadows
with
wealth
the
little
italian
garden
to
the
of
the
hall
was
where
my
lady
spent
most
of
the
day
here
she
would
cause
chairs
to
be
brought
out
for
mistress
margaret
and
herself
and
a
small
selection
of
devotional
books
an
orange
leather
volume
powdered
all
over
with
pierced
hearts
filled
with
extracts
in
a
clear
brown
ink
another
book
called
chappellet
de
while
from
her
girdle
beside
her
there
always
hung
an
hours
of
the
blessed
virgin
fastened
by
a
long
strip
of
leather
prolonged
from
the
binding
here
the
two
old
sisters
would
sit
in
the
shadow
of
the
yew
hedge
taking
it
by
turns
to
read
and
embroider
or
talking
a
little
now
and
then
in
quiet
voices
with
long
silences
broken
only
by
the
hum
of
insects
in
the
hot
air
or
the
quick
flight
of
a
bird
in
the
tall
trees
behind
the
hedge
here
too
isabel
often
came
also
bringing
her
embroidery
and
sat
and
talked
and
watched
the
wrinkled
tranquil
faces
of
the
two
old
ladies
and
envied
their
peace
hubert
had
gone
as
he
had
promised
his
father
on
a
long
visit
and
was
not
expected
home
until
at
least
the
autumn
james
will
be
here
said
lady
maxwell
suddenly
one
hot
afternoon
isabel
looked
up
in
surprise
he
had
not
been
at
home
for
so
long
but
the
thought
of
his
coming
was
very
pleasant
to
her
and
mary
corbet
too
went
on
the
old
lady
will
be
here
or
the
day
after
isabel
asked
who
this
was
she
is
one
of
the
queen
ladies
my
dear
and
a
great
talker
she
is
very
amusing
sometimes
said
mistress
margaret
clear
little
voice
and
james
will
be
here
said
isabel
yes
my
child
they
always
suit
one
another
and
we
have
known
mary
for
years
and
is
miss
corbet
a
catholic
yes
my
dear
her
grace
seems
to
like
them
about
her
when
isabel
went
up
again
to
the
hall
in
the
evening
a
couple
of
days
later
she
found
james
sitting
with
his
mother
and
aunt
in
the
same
part
of
the
garden
james
who
rose
as
she
came
through
the
yew
archway
and
stood
waiting
to
greet
her
was
a
tall
pleasant
man
isabel
noticed
as
she
came
up
his
strong
friendly
face
that
had
something
of
hubert
look
in
it
and
felt
an
immediate
sense
of
relief
from
her
timidity
at
meeting
this
man
whose
name
it
was
said
was
beginning
to
be
known
among
the
poets
and
about
whom
the
still
more
formidable
fact
was
being
repeated
that
he
was
a
rising
man
at
court
and
had
attracted
the
queen
favour
as
they
sat
down
again
together
she
noticed
too
his
strong
delicate
hand
in
its
snowy
ruff
for
he
was
always
perfectly
dressed
as
it
lay
on
his
knee
and
again
thought
of
hubert
browner
and
squarer
hand
we
were
talking
mistress
isabel
about
the
play
and
the
new
theatres
i
was
at
the
blackfriars
only
last
week
ah
and
i
met
buxton
there
he
went
on
turning
to
his
mother
dear
henry
said
lady
maxwell
he
told
me
when
i
last
saw
him
that
he
could
never
go
to
london
again
his
religion
was
too
expensive
he
said
james
white
teeth
glimmered
in
a
smile
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
prison
next
time
instead
of
paying
the
fine
it
would
be
cheaper
he
thought
i
hear
her
grace
loves
the
play
said
mistress
margaret
indeed
she
does
i
saw
her
at
whitehall
the
other
day
when
the
children
of
the
chapel
royal
were
acting
she
clapped
and
called
out
with
delight
but
mistress
corbet
can
tell
you
more
than
i
can
ah
here
she
is
isabel
looked
up
and
saw
a
wonderful
figure
coming
briskly
along
the
terrace
and
down
the
steps
that
led
from
the
house
miss
corbet
was
dressed
with
what
she
herself
would
have
said
was
a
milkmaid
plainness
but
isabel
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
elaborate
ruff
and
wings
of
muslin
and
lace
the
shining
peacock
gown
the
coils
of
black
hair
and
the
twinkling
buckled
feet
she
had
a
lively
bright
face
a
little
pale
with
a
high
forehead
and
black
arched
brows
and
dancing
eyes
and
a
little
scarlet
mouth
that
twitched
humorously
now
and
then
after
speaking
she
rustled
up
flicking
her
handkerchief
and
exclaiming
against
the
heat
isabel
was
presented
to
her
she
sat
down
on
a
settle
james
drew
forward
for
her
with
the
handkerchief
still
whisking
at
the
flies
i
am
ashamed
to
come
out
like
this
she
began
mistress
plesse
would
break
her
heart
at
my
lace
you
country
ladies
have
far
more
sense
i
am
the
slave
of
my
habits
what
were
you
talking
of
that
you
look
so
gravely
at
me
james
told
her
oh
her
grace
said
miss
corbet
indeed
i
think
sometimes
she
is
never
off
the
stage
herself
ah
and
what
art
and
passion
she
shows
too
we
are
all
loyal
subjects
here
said
james
tell
us
what
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
she
said
never
was
there
one
who
loved
more
and
to
occupy
the
centre
of
the
stage
too
and
the
throne
too
if
there
be
one
she
added
miss
corbet
talked
always
at
her
audience
she
hardly
ever
looked
directly
at
any
one
but
up
or
down
or
even
shut
her
eyes
and
tilted
her
face
forward
while
she
talked
and
all
the
while
she
kept
an
incessant
movement
of
her
lips
or
handkerchief
or
tapped
her
foot
or
shifted
her
position
a
little
isabel
thought
she
had
never
seen
any
one
so
restless
then
she
went
on
to
tell
them
of
the
queen
she
was
so
startlingly
frank
that
lady
maxwell
again
and
again
looked
up
as
if
to
interrupt
but
she
always
came
off
the
thin
ice
in
time
it
was
abominable
gossip
but
she
talked
with
such
a
genial
air
of
loyal
good
humour
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
find
fault
miss
corbet
was
plainly
accustomed
to
act
as
court
circular
or
even
as
lecturer
and
on
the
most
popular
subject
in
england
but
her
grace
surpassed
herself
in
acting
the
tyrant
last
january
you
would
have
sworn
her
really
angry
this
was
how
it
fell
out
i
was
in
the
anteroom
one
day
waiting
for
her
grace
when
i
thought
i
heard
her
call
so
i
tapped
i
got
no
clear
answer
but
i
heard
her
voice
within
so
i
entered
and
there
was
her
majesty
sitting
a
little
apart
in
a
chair
by
herself
with
the
secretary
poor
rat
at
the
table
writing
what
she
bade
him
and
looking
at
her
quick
and
like
a
child
at
a
lifted
rod
and
there
was
her
grace
she
had
kicked
her
stool
over
and
one
shoe
had
fallen
and
she
was
striking
the
arm
of
her
chair
as
she
spoke
and
her
rings
rapped
as
loud
as
a
drunken
watchman
and
her
face
was
all
white
and
her
eyes
glaring
and
mary
began
to
glare
and
raise
her
voice
too
and
she
was
crying
out
god
son
sir
i
will
have
them
hanged
tell
the
but
i
dare
not
say
what
she
called
my
lord
sussex
but
few
would
have
recognised
him
from
what
she
said
him
that
i
will
have
my
will
done
these
and
she
called
the
rebels
a
name
i
dare
not
tell
you
men
have
risen
against
me
these
two
months
and
yet
they
are
not
hanged
hang
them
in
their
own
villages
that
their
children
may
see
what
treason
brings
all
this
while
i
was
standing
at
the
open
door
thinking
she
had
called
me
but
she
was
as
if
she
saw
nought
but
the
gallows
and
beyond
and
i
spoke
softly
to
her
asking
what
she
wished
and
she
sprang
up
and
ran
at
me
and
struck
me
yes
again
and
again
across
the
face
with
her
open
hand
rings
and
all
and
i
ran
out
in
tears
yes
went
on
miss
corbet
in
a
moment
dropping
her
voice
and
pensively
looking
up
at
nothing
yes
you
would
have
said
she
was
really
angry
so
quick
and
natural
were
her
movements
and
so
loud
her
voice
james
face
wrinkled
up
silently
in
amusement
and
lady
maxwell
seemed
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
miss
corbet
began
again
and
to
see
her
grace
act
the
lover
it
was
a
miracle
you
would
have
said
that
our
artemis
repented
of
her
coldness
if
you
had
not
known
it
was
but
or
let
us
say
perhaps
a
rehearsal
if
you
had
seen
what
i
once
saw
at
nonsuch
it
was
on
a
summer
evening
and
we
were
all
on
the
bowling
green
and
her
grace
was
within
doors
not
to
be
disturbed
my
lord
leicester
was
to
come
but
we
thought
had
not
arrived
then
i
had
occasion
to
go
to
my
room
to
get
a
little
book
i
had
promised
to
show
to
caroline
and
thinking
no
harm
i
ran
through
into
the
court
and
there
stood
a
horse
his
legs
apart
all
steaming
and
blowing
some
courier
said
i
to
myself
and
never
thought
to
look
at
the
trappings
and
so
i
ran
upstairs
to
go
to
the
gallery
across
which
lay
my
chamber
and
i
came
up
and
just
began
to
push
open
the
door
when
i
heard
her
grace
voice
beyond
and
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
stopped
and
dared
not
close
the
door
again
nor
go
downstairs
for
fear
i
should
be
heard
and
there
were
two
walking
within
the
gallery
her
grace
and
my
lord
and
my
lord
was
all
disordered
with
hard
riding
and
nearly
as
spent
as
his
poor
beast
below
and
her
grace
had
her
arm
round
his
neck
for
i
saw
them
through
the
chink
and
she
fondled
and
pinched
his
ear
and
said
over
and
over
again
my
sweet
robin
and
then
crooned
and
moaned
at
him
and
he
whenever
he
could
fetch
a
breath
and
oh
i
promise
you
he
did
blow
murmured
back
calling
her
his
queen
which
indeed
she
was
and
his
sweetheart
and
his
moon
and
his
star
which
she
was
not
but
was
all
in
the
play
well
again
by
the
favour
of
god
they
did
not
see
how
the
door
was
open
and
i
couched
behind
it
for
the
sun
was
shining
level
through
the
west
window
in
their
eyes
but
why
they
did
not
hear
me
as
i
ran
upstairs
and
opened
the
door
he
only
knows
unless
my
lord
was
too
sorely
out
of
breath
and
her
grace
too
intent
upon
her
well
i
promise
you
the
acting
was
so
good
he
so
spent
and
she
so
tender
that
i
nearly
cried
out
brava
as
i
saw
them
but
that
i
remembered
in
time
was
meant
to
be
a
private
rehearsal
but
i
have
seen
her
grace
act
near
as
passionate
a
part
before
the
whole
company
sometimes
the
two
old
ladies
seemed
not
greatly
pleased
with
all
this
talk
and
as
for
isabel
she
sat
silent
and
overwhelmed
mary
corbet
glanced
quickly
at
their
faces
when
she
had
done
and
turned
a
little
in
her
seat
ah
look
at
that
peacock
she
cried
out
as
a
stately
bird
stepped
delicately
out
of
the
shrubbery
on
to
the
low
wall
a
little
way
off
and
stood
balancing
himself
he
is
loyal
too
and
has
come
to
hear
news
of
his
queen
he
has
come
to
see
his
cousin
from
town
said
james
looking
at
miss
corbet
glowing
dress
and
to
learn
of
the
london
fashions
mary
got
up
and
curtseyed
to
the
astonished
bird
who
looked
at
her
with
his
head
lowered
as
he
took
a
high
step
or
two
and
then
paused
again
with
his
burnished
breast
swaying
a
little
from
side
to
side
he
invites
you
to
a
dance
went
on
james
gravely
a
pavane
miss
corbet
sat
down
again
i
dare
not
dance
a
pavane
she
said
with
a
real
peacock
surely
said
james
with
a
courtier
air
you
are
too
pitiful
for
him
and
too
pitiless
for
us
i
dare
not
she
said
again
for
he
never
ceases
to
practise
in
hopes
said
james
that
one
day
you
will
dance
it
with
him
and
then
the
two
went
off
into
the
splendid
fantastic
nonsense
that
the
wits
loved
to
talk
that
grotesque
exaggerated
phrasing
made
fashionable
by
lyly
it
was
like
a
kind
of
impromptu
in
an
assault
of
arms
where
the
rhythm
and
the
flash
and
the
graceful
turns
are
of
more
importance
than
the
actual
thrusts
received
the
two
old
ladies
embroidered
on
in
silence
but
their
eyes
twinkled
and
little
wrinkles
flickered
about
the
corners
of
their
lips
but
poor
isabel
sat
bewildered
it
was
so
elaborate
so
empty
she
had
almost
said
so
wicked
to
take
the
solemn
gift
of
speech
and
make
it
dance
this
wild
fandango
and
as
absurdity
climbed
and
capered
in
a
shower
of
sparks
and
gleams
on
the
shoulders
of
absurdity
and
was
itself
surmounted
and
the
names
of
heathen
gods
and
nymphs
and
and
classical
women
whisked
across
the
stage
and
were
tossed
higher
and
higher
until
the
whole
mad
erection
blazed
up
and
went
out
in
a
shower
of
stars
and
gems
of
allusions
and
phrases
like
a
flight
of
rockets
bright
and
bewildering
at
the
moment
but
leaving
a
barren
darkness
and
dazzled
eyes
behind
the
poor
little
puritan
country
child
almost
cried
with
perplexity
and
annoyance
if
the
two
talkers
had
looked
at
one
another
and
burst
into
laughter
at
the
end
she
would
have
understood
it
to
be
a
joke
though
to
her
mind
but
a
poor
one
but
when
they
had
ended
and
mary
corbet
had
risen
and
then
swept
down
to
the
ground
in
a
great
silent
curtsey
and
james
the
grave
sensible
gentleman
had
solemnly
bowed
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
his
heels
together
like
a
monsieur
and
then
she
had
rustled
off
in
her
peacock
dress
to
the
house
with
her
muslin
wings
bulging
behind
her
and
no
one
had
laughed
or
reproved
or
explained
it
was
almost
too
much
and
she
looked
across
to
lady
maxwell
with
an
appeal
in
her
eyes
james
saw
it
and
his
face
relaxed
you
must
not
take
us
too
seriously
mistress
isabel
he
said
in
his
kindly
way
it
is
all
part
of
the
game
the
game
she
said
piteously
yes
said
mistress
margaret
intent
on
her
embroidery
the
game
of
playing
at
kings
and
queens
and
courtiers
and
ruffs
and
james
face
again
broke
into
his
silent
laugh
you
are
acid
dear
aunt
he
said
but
began
isabel
again
but
it
is
wrong
you
think
he
interrupted
to
talk
such
nonsense
well
mistress
isabel
i
am
not
sure
you
are
not
right
and
the
dancing
light
in
his
eyes
went
out
no
no
no
she
cried
distressed
i
did
not
mean
that
only
i
did
not
understand
i
know
i
know
and
please
god
you
never
will
and
he
looked
at
her
with
such
a
tender
gravity
that
her
eyes
fell
isabel
is
right
went
on
mistress
margaret
in
her
singularly
sweet
old
voice
and
you
know
it
my
nephew
it
is
very
well
as
a
pastime
but
some
folks
make
it
their
business
and
that
is
nothing
less
than
fooling
with
the
gifts
of
the
good
god
well
aunt
margaret
said
james
softly
i
shall
not
have
much
more
of
it
you
need
not
fear
for
me
lady
maxwell
looked
quickly
at
her
son
for
a
moment
and
down
again
he
made
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
with
his
head
mistress
margaret
looked
across
at
him
with
her
tender
eyes
beaming
love
and
sorrow
and
there
fell
a
little
eloquent
silence
while
isabel
glanced
shyly
from
one
to
the
other
and
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
miss
mary
corbet
stayed
a
few
weeks
as
the
custom
was
when
travelling
meant
so
much
but
isabel
was
scarcely
nearer
understanding
her
she
accepted
her
as
simple
clean
souls
so
often
have
to
accept
riddles
in
this
world
as
a
mystery
that
no
doubt
had
a
significance
though
she
could
not
recognise
it
so
she
did
not
exactly
dislike
or
distrust
her
but
regarded
her
silently
out
of
her
own
candid
soul
as
one
would
say
a
small
fearless
bird
in
a
nest
must
regard
the
man
who
thrusts
his
strange
hot
face
into
her
green
pleasant
world
and
tries
to
make
endearing
sounds
for
isabel
was
very
fascinating
to
mary
corbet
she
had
scarcely
ever
before
been
thrown
so
close
to
any
one
so
serenely
pure
she
would
come
down
to
the
dower
house
again
and
again
at
all
hours
of
the
day
rustling
along
in
her
silk
and
seize
upon
isabel
in
the
little
upstairs
parlour
or
her
bedroom
and
question
her
minutely
about
her
ways
and
ideas
and
she
would
look
at
her
silently
for
a
minute
or
two
together
and
then
suddenly
laugh
and
kiss
her
isabel
transparency
was
almost
as
great
a
riddle
to
her
as
her
own
obscurity
to
isabel
and
sometimes
she
would
throw
herself
on
isabel
bed
and
lie
there
with
her
arms
behind
her
head
to
the
deplorable
ruin
of
her
ruff
with
her
buckled
feet
twitching
and
tapping
and
go
on
and
on
talking
like
a
running
stream
in
the
sun
that
runs
for
the
sheer
glitter
and
tinkle
of
it
and
accomplishes
nothing
but
she
was
more
respectful
to
isabel
simplicity
than
at
first
and
avoided
dangerous
edges
and
treacherous
ground
in
a
manner
that
surprised
herself
telling
her
of
the
pageants
at
court
and
fair
exterior
of
it
all
and
little
about
the
poisonous
conversations
and
jests
and
the
corrupt
souls
that
engaged
in
them
she
was
immensely
interested
in
isabel
religion
tell
me
child
she
said
one
day
i
can
not
understand
such
a
religion
it
is
not
like
the
protestant
religion
at
court
at
all
all
that
the
protestants
do
there
is
to
hear
sermons
it
is
all
so
dismal
and
noisy
but
here
with
you
you
have
a
proper
soul
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
like
a
little
very
prim
and
plain
but
living
and
wholesome
and
pleasant
to
walk
in
at
sunset
and
these
protestants
that
i
know
are
more
like
a
paved
court
at
noon
all
hot
and
hard
and
glaring
they
give
me
the
headache
tell
me
all
about
it
of
course
isabel
could
not
though
she
tried
again
and
again
her
definitions
were
as
barren
as
any
others
i
see
said
mary
corbet
one
day
sitting
up
straight
and
looking
at
isabel
it
is
not
your
religion
but
you
your
religion
is
as
dull
as
all
the
rest
but
your
soul
is
sweet
my
dear
and
the
wilderness
blossoms
where
you
set
your
feet
there
is
nothing
to
blush
about
it
no
credit
to
you
but
to
god
isabel
hated
this
sort
of
thing
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
soul
was
being
dragged
out
of
a
cool
thicket
from
the
green
shadow
and
the
flowers
and
set
stripped
in
the
high
road
another
time
miss
corbet
spoke
yet
more
plainly
you
are
a
catholic
at
heart
my
dear
or
you
would
be
if
you
knew
what
the
religion
was
but
your
father
good
man
has
never
understood
it
himself
and
so
you
do
know
it
either
what
you
think
about
us
my
dear
is
as
much
like
the
truth
as
as
i
am
like
a
saint
or
you
like
a
sinner
i
be
bound
now
that
you
think
us
all
idolaters
isabel
had
to
confess
that
she
did
think
something
of
the
sort
there
now
what
did
i
say
why
have
either
of
those
two
old
nuns
at
the
hall
taught
you
any
better
they
they
do
talk
to
me
about
religion
ah
i
see
or
the
puritan
father
would
withdraw
his
lamb
from
the
wolves
but
if
they
are
wolves
my
dear
you
must
confess
that
they
have
the
decency
to
wear
sheep
clothing
and
that
the
disguise
is
excellent
and
so
it
gradually
came
about
that
isabel
began
to
learn
an
immense
deal
about
what
the
catholics
really
believed
far
more
than
she
had
ever
learnt
in
all
her
life
before
from
the
ladies
at
the
hall
who
were
unwilling
to
teach
her
and
her
father
who
was
unable
about
through
miss
corbet
visit
anthony
came
home
at
first
he
pronounced
against
her
inexorably
dismissing
her
as
nonsense
and
as
a
fine
lady
terms
to
him
interchangeable
then
his
condemnation
began
to
falter
then
ceased
then
acquittal
and
at
last
commendation
succeeded
for
miss
corbet
asked
his
advice
about
the
dogs
and
how
to
get
that
wonderful
gloss
on
their
coats
that
his
had
and
she
asked
his
help
too
once
or
twice
and
praised
his
skill
and
once
asked
to
feel
his
muscle
and
then
she
was
so
gallant
in
ways
that
appealed
to
him
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
eliza
she
kissed
that
ferocious
head
in
spite
of
the
glare
of
that
steady
yellow
eye
and
yet
all
with
an
air
of
trusting
to
anthony
protection
she
tore
her
silk
stocking
across
the
instep
in
a
bramble
and
scratched
her
foot
without
even
drawing
attention
to
it
as
she
followed
him
along
one
of
his
short
cuts
through
the
copse
and
it
was
only
by
chance
that
he
saw
it
and
then
this
gallant
girl
so
simple
and
ignorant
as
she
seemed
out
of
doors
was
like
a
splendid
queen
indoors
and
was
able
to
hold
her
own
or
rather
to
soar
above
all
these
elders
who
were
so
apt
to
look
over
anthony
head
on
grave
occasions
and
they
all
had
to
listen
while
she
talked
in
fact
the
first
time
he
saw
her
at
the
hall
in
all
her
splendour
he
could
hardly
realise
it
was
the
same
girl
till
she
laughed
up
at
him
and
nodded
and
said
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
the
afternoon
stroll
and
how
much
she
would
have
to
tell
when
she
got
back
to
court
in
short
so
incessant
were
her
poses
and
so
skilful
her
manner
and
tone
and
so
foolish
this
poor
boy
that
in
a
very
few
days
after
he
had
pronounced
her
to
be
nonsense
anthony
was
at
her
feet
hopelessly
fascinated
by
the
combination
of
the
glitter
and
friendliness
of
this
fine
court
lady
to
do
her
justice
she
would
have
behaved
exactly
the
same
to
a
statue
or
even
to
nothing
at
all
as
a
peacock
dances
and
postures
and
vibrates
his
plumes
to
a
kitten
and
had
no
more
deliberate
intention
of
giving
pain
to
anybody
than
a
nightshade
has
of
poisoning
a
silly
sheep
the
sublime
conceit
of
a
boy
of
fifteen
made
him
of
course
think
that
she
had
detected
in
him
a
nobility
that
others
overlooked
and
so
anthony
began
a
gorgeous
course
of
in
which
he
moved
as
a
kind
of
king
worshipped
and
reverenced
by
this
splendid
creature
who
after
a
disillusionment
from
the
empty
vanities
of
a
court
life
and
a
favour
found
at
last
the
lord
of
her
heart
in
a
simple
manly
young
countryman
these
dreams
however
he
had
the
grace
and
modesty
to
keep
wholly
to
himself
mary
came
down
one
day
and
found
the
two
in
the
garden
together
come
my
child
she
said
and
you
too
master
anthony
if
you
can
spare
time
to
escort
us
and
take
me
to
the
church
i
want
to
see
it
the
church
said
isabel
that
is
locked
we
must
go
to
the
rectory
locked
exclaimed
mary
and
is
that
part
of
the
blessed
reformation
well
come
at
any
rate
they
all
went
across
to
the
village
and
down
the
green
towards
the
rectory
whose
garden
adjoined
the
churchyard
on
the
south
side
of
the
church
anthony
walked
with
something
of
an
air
in
front
of
the
two
ladies
isabel
told
her
as
they
went
about
the
rector
and
his
views
mary
nodded
and
smiled
and
seemed
to
understand
we
will
tap
at
the
window
said
anthony
it
is
the
quickest
way
they
came
up
towards
the
study
window
that
looked
on
to
the
drive
when
anthony
who
was
in
front
suddenly
recoiled
and
then
laughed
they
are
at
it
again
he
said
the
next
moment
mary
was
looking
through
the
window
too
the
rector
was
sitting
in
his
chair
opposite
a
small
dark
man
but
his
face
was
set
with
a
look
of
distressed
determination
and
his
lower
lip
was
sucked
in
his
eyes
were
fixed
firmly
on
a
tall
slender
woman
whose
back
was
turned
to
the
window
and
who
seemed
to
be
declaiming
with
outstretched
hand
the
rector
suddenly
saw
the
faces
at
the
window
we
seem
to
be
interrupting
said
mary
coolly
as
she
turned
away
chapter
v
a
rider
from
london
we
will
walk
on
master
anthony
said
mistress
corbet
will
you
bring
the
keys
when
the
rector
and
his
lady
have
done
she
spoke
with
a
vehement
bitterness
that
made
isabel
look
at
her
in
amazement
as
the
two
walked
on
by
the
private
path
to
the
churchyard
gate
mary
face
was
set
in
a
kind
of
fury
and
she
went
forward
with
her
chin
thrust
disdainfully
out
biting
her
lip
isabel
said
nothing
as
they
reached
the
gate
they
heard
steps
behind
them
and
turning
saw
the
minister
and
anthony
hastening
together
dent
was
in
his
cassock
and
gown
and
square
cap
and
carried
the
keys
his
little
scholarly
face
with
a
sharp
curved
nose
like
a
beak
and
dark
eyes
set
rather
too
close
together
was
not
unlike
a
bird
and
a
way
he
had
of
sudden
sharp
movements
of
his
head
increased
the
likeness
mary
looked
at
him
with
scarcely
veiled
contempt
he
glanced
at
her
sharply
and
uneasily
mistress
mary
corbet
he
said
interrogatively
mary
bowed
to
him
may
we
see
the
church
sir
your
church
i
should
say
perhaps
that
is
if
we
are
not
disturbing
you
dent
made
a
polite
inclination
and
opened
the
gate
for
them
to
go
through
then
mary
changed
her
tactics
and
a
genial
look
came
over
her
face
but
isabel
who
glanced
at
her
now
and
again
as
they
went
round
to
the
porch
at
the
still
felt
uneasy
as
the
rector
was
unlocking
the
porch
door
mary
surveyed
him
with
a
pleased
smile
why
you
look
quite
like
a
priest
she
said
do
your
bishops
or
whatever
you
call
them
allow
that
dress
i
thought
you
had
done
away
with
it
all
dent
looked
at
her
but
seeing
nothing
but
geniality
and
interest
in
her
face
explained
elaborately
in
the
porch
that
he
was
a
catholic
priest
practically
though
the
word
minister
was
more
commonly
used
and
that
it
was
the
old
church
still
only
cleansed
from
superstitions
mary
shook
her
head
at
him
cheerfully
smiling
like
a
happy
puzzled
child
it
is
all
too
difficult
for
me
she
said
it
can
not
be
the
same
church
or
why
should
we
poor
catholics
be
so
much
abused
and
persecuted
besides
what
of
the
pope
dent
explained
that
the
pope
was
one
of
the
superstitions
in
question
ah
i
see
you
are
too
sharp
for
me
said
mary
beaming
at
him
then
they
entered
the
church
and
mary
began
immediately
on
a
running
comment
how
sad
that
little
niche
looks
she
said
i
suppose
our
lady
is
in
pieces
somewhere
on
a
dunghill
surely
father
i
beg
your
pardon
dent
it
can
not
be
the
same
religion
if
you
have
knocked
our
lady
to
pieces
but
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
she
was
a
superstition
too
and
where
is
the
old
altar
is
that
broken
too
and
is
that
a
superstition
too
what
a
number
there
must
have
been
and
the
holy
water
too
i
see
but
that
looks
a
very
nice
table
up
there
you
have
instead
ah
and
i
see
you
read
the
new
prayers
from
a
new
desk
outside
the
screen
and
not
from
the
priest
stall
was
that
a
superstition
too
and
the
mass
vestments
has
your
wife
had
any
of
them
made
up
to
be
useful
the
stoles
are
no
good
i
fear
but
you
could
make
charming
stomachers
out
of
the
chasubles
they
were
walking
slowly
up
the
centre
aisle
now
dent
had
to
explain
that
the
vestments
had
been
burnt
on
the
green
ah
yes
i
see
she
said
and
do
you
wear
a
surplice
or
do
you
not
like
them
i
see
the
chancel
roof
is
all
broken
were
there
angels
there
once
i
suppose
so
but
how
strange
to
break
them
all
unless
they
are
superstitions
too
i
thought
protestants
believed
in
them
but
i
see
i
was
wrong
what
you
believe
in
mr
dent
she
asked
turning
large
bright
perplexed
eyes
upon
him
for
a
moment
but
she
gave
him
no
time
to
answer
ah
she
cried
suddenly
and
her
voice
rang
with
pain
there
is
the
and
she
went
down
on
her
knees
at
the
chancel
entrance
bending
down
it
seemed
in
an
agony
of
devout
sorrow
and
shame
and
kissed
with
a
gentle
lingering
reverence
the
great
slab
with
its
five
crosses
set
in
the
ground
at
the
destruction
of
the
altar
to
show
there
was
no
sanctity
attached
to
it
she
knelt
there
a
moment
or
two
her
lips
moving
and
her
black
eyes
cast
up
at
the
great
east
window
cracked
and
flawed
with
stones
and
poles
the
puritan
boy
and
girl
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
they
had
not
seen
this
side
of
her
before
when
she
rose
from
her
knees
her
eyes
seemed
bright
with
tears
and
her
voice
was
tender
forgive
me
dent
she
said
with
a
kind
of
pathetic
dignity
putting
out
a
slender
hand
to
him
but
but
you
know
for
i
think
perhaps
you
have
some
sympathy
for
us
poor
catholics
you
know
what
all
this
means
to
me
she
went
up
into
the
chancel
and
looked
about
her
in
silence
this
was
the
piscina
mistress
corbet
said
the
rector
she
nodded
her
head
regretfully
as
at
some
relic
of
a
dead
friend
but
said
nothing
they
came
out
again
presently
and
turned
through
the
old
iron
gates
into
what
had
been
the
maxwell
chapel
the
centre
was
occupied
by
an
with
sir
nicholas
parents
lying
in
black
stone
upon
it
old
sir
james
held
his
right
gauntlet
in
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
hand
held
the
right
hand
of
his
wife
which
was
crossed
over
to
meet
it
and
the
two
steady
faces
gazed
upon
the
disfigured
roof
the
altar
where
a
weekly
requiem
had
been
said
for
them
was
gone
and
the
footpace
and
piscina
alone
showed
where
it
had
stood
this
was
a
chantry
of
course
said
mistress
corbet
the
rector
confessed
that
it
had
been
so
ah
she
said
mournfully
the
altar
is
cast
out
and
the
priest
gone
but
but
forgive
me
sir
the
money
is
here
still
but
then
she
added
i
suppose
the
money
is
not
a
superstition
when
they
reached
the
west
entrance
again
she
turned
and
looked
up
the
aisle
again
and
the
rood
she
said
even
christ
crucified
is
gone
then
in
name
what
is
left
and
her
eyes
turned
fiercely
for
a
moment
on
the
rector
at
least
courtesy
and
christian
kindness
is
left
madam
he
said
sternly
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
went
out
and
isabel
and
anthony
followed
startled
and
ashamed
but
mary
had
recovered
herself
as
she
came
on
to
the
head
of
the
stone
stairs
beside
which
the
stump
of
the
churchyard
cross
stood
standing
there
was
the
same
tall
slender
woman
whose
back
they
had
seen
through
the
window
and
who
now
stood
eyeing
mary
with
lids
her
face
was
very
white
with
hard
lines
from
nose
to
mouth
and
thin
tightly
compressed
lips
mary
swept
her
with
one
look
and
then
passed
on
and
down
the
steps
followed
by
isabel
and
anthony
as
the
rector
came
out
locking
the
church
door
again
behind
him
as
they
went
up
the
green
a
shrill
thin
voice
began
to
scold
from
over
the
churchyard
wall
and
they
heard
the
lower
determined
voice
of
the
minister
answering
they
are
at
it
again
said
anthony
once
more
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that
master
anthony
said
mistress
corbet
who
seemed
herself
again
now
she
is
just
a
scold
said
the
lad
the
hate
her
you
seem
not
to
love
her
said
mary
smiling
oh
mistress
corbet
do
you
know
what
she
said
and
then
he
broke
off
she
is
no
friend
to
catholics
i
suppose
said
mary
seeming
to
notice
nothing
she
is
always
making
mischief
he
went
on
eagerly
the
rector
would
be
well
enough
but
for
her
he
is
a
good
fellow
really
there
there
said
mary
and
you
think
me
a
scold
too
i
daresay
well
you
know
i
can
not
bear
to
see
these
old
churches
well
perhaps
i
was
and
then
she
broke
off
again
and
was
silent
the
brother
and
sister
presently
turned
back
to
the
dower
house
and
mary
went
on
and
through
the
hall
straight
into
the
italian
garden
where
mistress
margaret
was
sitting
alone
at
her
embroidery
my
sister
has
been
called
away
by
the
housekeeper
she
explained
but
she
will
be
back
presently
mary
sat
down
and
took
up
the
little
tawny
book
that
lay
by
lady
maxwell
chair
and
began
to
turn
it
over
idly
while
she
talked
the
old
lady
by
her
seemed
to
invite
confidences
i
have
been
to
see
the
church
said
mary
the
rector
showed
it
to
me
what
a
beautiful
place
it
must
have
been
ah
said
mistress
margaret
i
only
came
to
live
here
a
few
years
ago
so
i
have
never
known
or
loved
it
like
my
sister
or
her
husband
they
can
hardly
bear
to
enter
it
now
you
know
that
sir
nicholas
father
and
grandfather
are
buried
in
the
maxwell
chapel
and
it
was
his
father
who
gave
the
furniture
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
images
of
our
lady
and
saint
christopher
that
they
burned
on
the
green
it
is
terrible
said
mary
a
little
absently
as
she
turned
the
pages
of
the
book
mistress
margaret
looked
up
ah
you
have
one
of
my
books
there
she
said
it
is
a
little
collection
i
made
miss
corbet
turned
to
the
beginning
but
only
found
a
seal
with
an
inscription
but
this
belonged
to
a
nunnery
she
said
yes
said
mistress
margaret
tranquilly
and
i
am
a
nun
mary
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
but
but
she
began
yes
mistress
corbet
we
were
dispersed
in
some
entered
the
other
nunneries
and
some
went
to
france
but
at
last
under
circumstances
that
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
i
came
here
under
spiritual
direction
and
have
observed
my
obligations
ever
since
and
have
you
always
said
your
offices
mary
asked
astonished
yes
my
dear
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
have
never
failed
yet
i
tell
you
this
of
course
because
you
are
one
of
us
and
because
you
have
a
faithful
heart
mistress
margaret
lifted
her
great
eyes
and
looked
at
mary
tenderly
and
penetratingly
and
this
is
one
of
your
books
she
asked
yes
my
dear
i
was
allowed
at
least
to
take
it
away
with
me
my
sister
here
is
very
fond
of
it
mary
opened
it
again
and
began
to
turn
the
pages
is
it
all
in
your
handwriting
mistress
torridon
yes
my
child
i
continued
writing
in
it
ever
since
i
first
entered
religion
in
so
you
see
the
handwriting
changes
a
little
and
she
smiled
to
herself
oh
but
this
is
charming
cried
mary
intent
on
the
book
read
it
my
dear
aloud
mary
read
let
me
not
rest
o
lord
nor
have
quiet
but
fill
my
soul
with
spiritual
travail
to
sing
and
say
o
mercy
jesu
sweet
thou
my
protection
art
in
the
battail
set
thou
aside
all
other
apparail
let
me
in
thee
feel
all
my
affiance
treasure
of
treasures
thou
dost
most
avail
grant
ere
i
die
shrift
pardon
repentance
her
voice
trembled
a
little
and
ceased
that
is
from
some
verses
of
dan
john
lydgate
i
think
said
mistress
margaret
here
is
another
said
mary
in
a
moment
or
two
jesu
at
thy
will
i
pray
that
i
may
be
all
my
heart
fulfil
with
perfect
love
to
thee
that
i

jesu
forgive
thou
me
and
suffer
me
never
to

jesu
for
thy
pity
the
nuns
of
hampole
gave
me
that
said
mistress
margaret
it
is
by
richard
rolle
the
hermit
tell
me
a
little
said
mary
corbet
suddenly
laying
down
the
book
about
the
nunnery
oh
my
dear
that
is
too
much
to
ask
but
how
happy
we
were
all
was
so
still
it
used
to
seem
sometimes
as
if
earth
were
just
a
dream
and
that
we
walked
in
paradise
sometimes
in
the
greater
silence
when
we
had
spoken
no
word
nor
heard
one
except
in
god
praise
it
used
to
seem
that
if
we
could
but
be
silent
a
little
longer
and
a
little
more
deeply
in
our
hearts
as
well
we
should
hear
them
talking
in
heaven
and
the
harps
and
the
saviour
soft
footsteps
but
it
was
not
always
like
that
you
mean
said
mary
softly
that
that
and
she
stopped
oh
it
was
hard
sometimes
but
not
often
god
is
so
good
but
he
used
to
allow
such
trouble
and
darkness
and
noise
to
be
in
our
hearts
sometimes
at
least
in
mine
but
then
of
course
i
was
always
very
wicked
but
sitting
in
the
sometimes
on
a
day
like
this
as
we
were
allowed
to
do
with
just
tall
thin
trees
like
poplars
and
cypresses
round
us
and
the
stream
running
through
the
long
grass
and
the
birds
and
the
soft
sky
and
the
little
breeze
and
then
peace
in
our
hearts
and
the
love
of
the
saviour
round
us
it
seemed
it
seemed
as
if
god
had
nothing
more
to
give
or
i
should
say
as
if
our
hearts
had
no
more
space
mary
was
strangely
subdued
and
quiet
her
little
restless
movements
were
still
for
once
and
her
quick
vivacious
face
was
tranquil
and
a
little
awed
oh
mistress
margaret
i
love
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
tell
me
more
well
my
dear
we
thought
too
much
about
ourselves
i
think
and
too
little
about
god
and
his
poor
children
who
were
not
so
happy
as
we
were
so
then
the
troubles
began
and
they
got
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
the
visitor
came
he
he
was
my
brother
my
dear
which
made
it
harder
but
he
made
a
good
end
i
will
tell
you
his
story
another
time
he
took
away
our
great
crucifix
and
our
jewelled
cope
that
old
wickham
used
to
wear
on
the
great
festivals
and
left
us
he
turned
me
out
too
and
another
who
asked
to
go
but
i
went
back
for
a
while
and
then
my
dear
although
we
offered
everything
our
cows
and
our
orchard
and
our
hens
and
all
we
had
you
know
how
it
ended
and
one
morning
in
may
old
wickham
said
mass
for
us
quite
early
before
the
sun
was
risen
for
the
last
time
and
and
he
cried
my
dear
at
the
elevation
and
and
we
were
all
crying
too
i
think
and
we
all
received
communion
together
for
the
last
time
and
and
then
we
all
went
away
leaving
just
old
dame
agnes
to
keep
the
house
until
the
commissioner
came
and
oh
my
dear
i
do
think
the
house
ever
looked
so
dear
as
it
did
that
morning
just
as
the
sun
rose
over
the
roofs
and
we
were
passing
out
through
the
meadow
door
where
we
had
sat
so
often
to
where
the
horses
were
waiting
to
take
us
away
miss
corbet
own
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
the
old
lady
finished
and
she
put
out
her
white
slender
hand
which
mistress
torridon
took
and
stroked
for
a
moment
well
she
said
i
have
talked
like
this
for
a
long
while
but
i
knew
you
would
understand
my
dear
i
have
watched
you
while
you
have
been
here
this
time
mary
corbet
smiled
a
little
uneasily
and
you
have
found
me
out
she
answered
smiling
no
no
but
i
think
our
saviour
has
found
you
out
or
at
least
he
is
drawing
very
near
a
slight
discomfort
made
itself
felt
in
mary
heart
this
nun
then
was
like
all
the
rest
always
trying
to
turn
the
whole
world
into
monks
and
nuns
by
hints
and
pretended
intuitions
into
the
unseen
and
you
think
i
should
be
a
nun
too
she
asked
with
just
a
shade
of
coolness
in
her
tone
i
should
suppose
not
said
mistress
margaret
tranquilly
you
do
not
seem
to
have
a
vocation
for
that
but
i
should
think
that
our
lord
means
you
to
serve
him
where
you
are
who
knows
what
you
may
not
accomplish
this
was
a
little
disconcerting
to
mary
corbet
it
was
not
at
all
what
she
had
expected
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
took
up
the
leather
book
again
and
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
mistress
margaret
went
on
serenely
with
her
embroidery
which
she
had
neglected
during
the
last
sentence
or
two
and
there
was
silence
tell
me
a
little
more
about
the
nunnery
said
mary
in
a
minute
or
two
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
the
book
on
her
knees
well
my
dear
i
scarcely
know
what
to
say
it
is
all
far
off
now
like
a
childhood
we
talked
very
little
not
at
all
until
recreation
except
by
signs
and
we
used
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
our
time
in
embroidery
that
is
where
i
learnt
this
and
she
held
out
her
work
to
mary
for
a
moment
it
was
an
exquisite
piece
of
needlework
representing
a
stag
running
through
thickets
of
green
twining
branches
that
wrapped
themselves
about
his
horns
and
feet
mary
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
it
before
what
does
it
mean
she
asked
looking
at
it
curiously
began
mistress
margaret
as
the
hart
brayeth
after
the
waterbrooks
and
she
took
the
embroidery
and
began
to
go
on
with
it
is
the
soul
you
see
desiring
and
fleeing
to
god
while
the
things
of
the
world
hold
her
back
well
you
see
it
is
difficult
to
talk
about
it
for
it
is
the
inner
life
that
is
the
real
history
of
a
convent
the
outer
things
are
all
plain
and
simple
like
all
else
well
said
mary
is
it
really
true
that
you
were
happy
the
old
lady
stopped
working
a
moment
and
looked
up
at
her
my
dear
there
is
no
happiness
in
the
world
like
it
she
said
simply
i
dream
sometimes
that
we
are
all
back
there
together
and
i
wake
crying
for
joy
the
other
night
i
dreamed
that
we
were
all
in
the
chapel
again
and
that
it
was
a
spring
morning
with
the
dawn
beginning
to
show
the
painted
windows
and
that
all
the
tapers
were
burning
and
that
mass
was
beginning
not
one
stall
was
empty
not
even
old
dame
gertrude
who
died
when
i
was
a
novice
was
lacking
and
wickham
made
us
a
sermon
after
the
creed
and
showed
us
the
crucifix
back
in
its
place
again
and
told
us
that
we
were
all
good
children
and
that
our
lord
had
only
sent
us
away
to
see
if
we
would
be
patient
and
that
he
was
now
pleased
with
us
and
had
let
us
come
home
again
and
that
we
should
never
have
to
go
away
again
not
even
when
we
died
and
then
i
understood
that
we
were
in
heaven
and
that
it
was
all
over
and
i
burst
out
into
tears
in
my
stall
for
happiness
and
then
i
awoke
and
found
myself
in
bed
but
my
cheeks
were
really
well
well
perhaps
by
the
mercy
of
god
it
may
all
come
true
some
day
she
spoke
so
simply
that
mary
corbet
was
amazed
she
had
always
fancied
that
the
religious
life
was
a
bitter
struggle
worth
indeed
living
for
those
who
could
bear
it
for
the
sake
of
the
eternal
reward
but
it
had
scarcely
even
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
so
full
of
joy
in
itself
and
she
looked
up
under
her
brows
at
the
old
lady
whose
needle
had
stopped
for
a
moment
a
moment
after
and
lady
maxwell
appeared
coming
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
and
at
her
side
anthony
who
was
dressed
ready
for
riding
old
mistress
margaret
had
as
she
said
been
watching
mary
corbet
those
last
few
weeks
and
had
determined
to
speak
to
her
plainly
her
instinct
had
told
her
that
beneath
this
flippancy
and
glitter
there
was
something
that
would
respond
and
she
was
anxious
to
leave
nothing
undone
by
which
mary
might
be
awakened
to
the
inner
world
that
was
in
such
danger
of
extinction
in
her
soul
it
cost
the
old
lady
a
great
effort
to
break
through
her
ordinary
reserve
but
she
judged
that
mary
could
only
be
reached
on
her
human
side
and
that
there
were
not
many
of
her
friends
whose
human
sympathy
would
draw
her
in
the
right
direction
it
is
strange
sometimes
to
find
that
some
silent
old
lady
has
a
power
for
sounding
human
character
which
far
shrewder
persons
lack
and
this
quiet
old
nun
so
ignorant
one
would
have
said
of
the
world
and
of
the
motives
from
which
ordinary
people
act
had
managed
somehow
to
touch
springs
in
this
girl
heart
that
had
never
been
reached
before
and
now
as
miss
corbet
and
lady
maxwell
talked
and
anthony
lolled
embarrassed
beside
them
attempting
now
and
then
to
join
in
the
conversation
mistress
margaret
as
she
sat
a
little
apart
and
worked
away
at
the
panting
stag
dreamed
away
smiling
quietly
to
herself
of
all
the
old
scenes
that
her
own
conversation
had
called
up
into
clearer
consciousness
of
the
pleasant
little
meadow
of
the
sussex
priory
with
the
old
and
the
straight
path
called
the
nun
walk
from
time
immemorial
all
lighted
with
the
pleasant
afternoon
glow
as
it
streamed
from
the
west
throwing
the
slender
poplar
shadows
across
the
grass
and
of
the
quiet
chatter
of
the
brook
as
it
from
the
fish
ponds
at
the
end
of
the
field
and
ran
through
the
meadows
beyond
the
hedge
the
cooing
of
the
pigeons
as
they
sunned
themselves
round
the
dial
in
the
centre
of
this
italian
garden
and
on
the
roof
of
the
hall
helped
on
her
reminiscences
for
there
had
been
a
dovecote
at
the
priory
where
were
all
her
sisters
now
those
who
had
sat
with
her
in
the
same
sombre
habits
in
the
garth
with
the
same
sunshine
in
their
hearts
some
she
knew
and
thanked
god
for
it
were
safe
in
glory
others
were
old
like
her
but
still
safe
in
holy
religion
in
france
where
as
yet
there
was
peace
and
sanctuary
for
the
servants
of
the
most
high
one
or
two
and
for
these
she
lifted
up
her
heart
in
petition
as
she
sat
one
or
two
had
gone
back
to
the
world
relinquished
everything
and
died
to
grace
then
the
old
faces
one
by
one
passed
before
her
old
dame
agnes
with
her
mumbling
lips
and
her
rosy
cheeks
like
wrinkled
apples
looking
so
fresh
and
wholesome
in
the
white
linen
about
her
face
and
then
the
others
one
by
one
that
sister
who
had
shown
such
passionate
devotion
at
first
that
they
all
thought
that
god
was
going
to
raise
up
a
saint
amongst
them
ah
god
help
her
she
had
sunk
back
at
the
dissolution
from
those
heights
of
sanctity
towards
whose
summits
she
had
set
her
face
down
into
the
muddy
torrent
of
the
world
that
went
roaring
down
to
the
abyss
and
who
was
responsible
there
was
dame
avice
the
sacristan
with
her
businesslike
movements
going
about
the
garden
gathering
flowers
for
the
altar
with
her
queer
pursed
lips
as
she
arranged
them
in
her
hands
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
how
annoying
she
used
to
be
sometimes
but
how
good
and
tender
at
heart
god
rest
her
soul
and
there
was
wickham
the
old
priest
who
had
been
their
chaplain
for
so
many
years
and
who
lived
in
the
village
parsonage
waited
upon
by
tom
downe
that
served
at
the
altar
too
he
who
had
got
the
horses
ready
when
the
nuns
had
to
go
at
last
on
that
may
morning
and
had
stood
there
holding
the
bridles
and
trying
to
hide
his
wet
face
behind
the
horses
where
was
tom
now
and
wickham
too
he
had
gone
to
france
with
some
of
the
nuns
but
he
had
never
settled
down
there
he
could
bear
the
french
ways
and
besides
he
had
left
his
heart
behind
him
buried
in
the
little
sussex
priory
among
the
meadows
and
so
the
old
lady
sat
musing
while
the
light
and
shadow
of
reminiscence
moved
across
her
face
and
her
lips
quivered
or
her
eyes
wrinkled
up
with
humour
at
the
thought
of
all
those
old
folks
with
their
faces
and
their
movements
and
their
ways
of
doing
and
speaking
ah
well
please
god
some
day
her
dream
would
really
come
true
and
they
shall
all
be
gathered
again
from
france
and
england
with
their
broken
hearts
mended
and
their
tears
wiped
away
and
wickham
himself
shall
minister
to
them
and
make
them
sermons
and
tom
downe
too
shall
be
there
to
minister
to
him
all
in
one
of
the
many
mansions
of
which
the
saviour
spoke
and
so
she
heard
nothing
of
the
talk
of
the
others
though
her
sister
looked
at
her
tenderly
once
or
twice
and
mary
corbet
chattered
and
twitched
her
buckles
in
the
sun
and
anthony
sat
embarrassed
in
the
midst
of
paradise
and
she
knew
nothing
of
where
she
was
nor
of
what
was
happening
round
her
until
mary
corbet
said
that
it
was
time
for
the
horses
to
be
round
and
that
she
must
go
and
get
ready
and
not
keep
james
and
anthony
waiting
then
as
she
and
anthony
went
towards
the
house
the
old
lady
looked
up
from
the
braying
stag
and
found
herself
alone
with
her
sister
mistress
margaret
waited
until
the
other
two
disappeared
up
the
steps
and
then
spoke
i
have
told
her
all
sister
she
said
she
can
be
trusted
lady
maxwell
nodded
gently
she
has
a
good
heart
went
on
the
other
and
our
lord
no
doubt
will
find
some
work
for
her
to
do
at
court
there
was
silence
again
broken
by
the
gentle
little
sound
of
the
silk
being
drawn
through
the
stuff
you
know
best
margaret
said
lady
maxwell
even
as
she
spoke
there
was
the
sound
of
a
door
thrown
violently
open
and
old
sir
nicholas
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
steps
hatless
and
plainly
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
beside
him
stood
a
courier
covered
with
the
dust
of
the
white
roads
and
his
face
crimson
with
hard
riding
sir
nicholas
stood
there
as
if
dazed
and
lady
maxwell
sprang
up
quickly
to
go
to
him
but
a
moment
after
there
appeared
behind
him
a
little
group
his
son
james
miss
corbet
and
a
servant
or
two
while
anthony
hung
back
and
james
came
up
quickly
and
took
his
father
by
the
arm
and
together
the
little
company
came
down
the
steps
into
the
still
and
sunny
garden
what
is
it
cried
lady
maxwell
trying
to
keep
her
voice
under
control
while
mistress
margaret
laid
her
work
quietly
down
and
stood
up
too
tell
my
lady
said
sir
nicholas
to
the
courier
who
stood
a
little
apart
if
you
please
my
lady
he
said
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
a
bull
of
the
holy
father
has
been
found
nailed
to
the
door
of
the
bishop
of
london
palace
deposing
elizabeth
and
releasing
all
her
subjects
from
their
allegiance
lady
maxwell
went
to
her
husband
and
took
him
by
the
arm
gently
what
does
it
mean
sweetheart
she
asked
it
means
that
catholics
must
choose
between
their
sovereign
and
their
god
god
have
mercy
said
a
servant
behind
chapter
vi
stewart
sir
nicholas
exclamatory
sentence
was
no
exaggeration
that
terrible
choice
of
which
he
spoke
with
his
old
eyes
shining
with
the
desire
to
make
it
did
not
indeed
come
so
immediately
as
he
anticipated
but
it
came
none
the
less
from
every
point
of
view
the
bull
was
unfortunate
though
it
may
have
been
a
necessity
for
it
marked
the
declaration
of
war
between
england
and
the
catholic
church
a
gentle
appeal
had
been
tried
before
elizabeth
who
it
must
be
remembered
had
been
crowned
during
mass
with
catholic
ceremonial
and
had
received
the
blessed
sacrament
had
been
entreated
by
the
pope
as
his
dear
daughter
in
christ
to
return
to
the
fold
and
now
there
seemed
to
him
no
possibility
left
but
this
ultimatum
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
see
what
else
from
his
point
of
view
he
could
have
done
to
continue
to
pretend
that
elizabeth
was
his
dear
daughter
would
have
discredited
his
fatherly
authority
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
christian
world
he
had
patiently
made
an
advance
towards
his
wayward
child
and
she
had
repudiated
and
scorned
him
nothing
was
left
but
to
recognise
and
treat
her
as
an
enemy
of
the
faith
an
usurper
of
spiritual
prerogatives
and
an
apostate
spoiler
of
churches
to
do
this
might
certainly
bring
trouble
upon
others
of
his
less
distinguished
but
more
obedient
children
who
were
in
her
power
but
to
pretend
that
the
suffering
thus
brought
down
upon
catholics
was
unnecessary
and
that
the
pope
alone
was
responsible
for
their
persecution
is
to
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
elizabeth
had
already
openly
defied
and
repudiated
his
authority
and
had
begun
to
do
her
utmost
to
coax
and
compel
his
children
to
be
disobedient
to
their
father
the
shock
of
the
bull
to
elizabeth
was
considerable
she
had
not
expected
this
extreme
measure
and
it
was
commonly
reported
too
that
france
and
spain
were
likely
now
to
unite
on
a
religious
basis
against
england
and
that
at
least
one
of
these
powers
had
sanctioned
the
issue
of
the
bull
this
of
course
helped
greatly
to
complicate
further
the
already
complicated
political
position
steps
were
taken
immediately
to
strengthen
england
position
against
scotland
with
whom
it
was
now
more
than
ever
to
be
feared
that
france
would
and
the
channel
fleet
was
reinforced
under
lord
clinton
and
placed
with
respect
to
france
in
what
was
almost
a
state
of
war
while
it
was
already
in
an
informal
state
of
war
with
spain
there
was
fierce
confusion
in
the
privy
council
elizabeth
who
at
once
began
to
vacillate
under
the
combined
threats
of
la
mothe
the
french
ambassador
and
the
arguments
of
the
friend
of
catholics
lord
arundel
was
with
ruin
by
lord
keeper
bacon
unless
she
would
throw
in
her
lot
finally
with
the
protestants
and
continue
her
hostility
and
resistance
to
the
catholic
scotch
party
but
in
spite
of
bacon
elizabeth
heart
failed
her
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rashness
of
mary
stuart
friends
lord
southampton
and
the
bishop
of
ross
the
queen
might
have
been
induced
to
substitute
conciliation
for
severity
towards
mary
and
the
catholic
party
generally
southampton
was
arrested
and
again
there
followed
the
further
encouragement
of
the
protestant
camp
by
the
rising
fortunes
of
the
huguenots
and
the
temporary
reverses
to
french
catholicism
so
the
pendulum
swung
this
way
and
that
elizabeth
policy
changed
almost
from
day
to
day
she
was
tormented
with
temporal
fears
of
a
continental
crusade
against
her
and
by
the
spiritual
terrors
of
the
pope
bull
and
her
unfathomable
fickleness
was
the
despair
of
her
servants
meanwhile
in
the
religious
world
a
furious
paper
war
broke
out
and
volleys
from
both
sides
followed
the
solemn
roar
and
crash
of
in
but
while
the
war
of
words
went
on
and
the
theological
assaults
and
charges
were
given
and
received
repulsed
or
avoided
something
practical
must
it
was
felt
be
done
immediately
and
search
was
made
high
and
low
for
other
copies
of
the
bull
the
lawyers
in
the
previous
year
had
fallen
under
suspicion
of
religious
unsoundness
judges
could
not
be
trusted
to
convict
catholics
accused
of
their
religion
and
counsel
was
unwilling
to
prosecute
them
therefore
the
first
inquisition
was
made
in
the
inns
of
court
and
almost
immediately
a
copy
of
the
bull
was
found
in
the
room
of
a
student
in
lincoln
inn
who
upon
the
rack
in
the
tower
confessed
that
he
had
received
it
from
one
john
felton
a
catholic
gentleman
who
lived
upon
his
property
in
southwark
upon
felton
arrest
for
he
had
not
attempted
to
escape
he
confessed
immediately
without
pressure
that
he
had
affixed
the
bull
to
the
bishop
of
london
gate
but
although
he
was
racked
repeatedly
he
would
not
incriminate
a
single
person
besides
himself
but
at
his
trial
would
only
assert
with
a
joyous
confidence
that
he
was
not
alone
and
that
peers
six
hundred
gentlemen
and
thirty
thousand
commoners
were
ready
to
die
in
the
holy
father
quarrel
he
behaved
with
astonishing
gallantry
throughout
and
after
his
condemnation
had
been
pronounced
upon
the
fourth
of
august
at
the
guildhall
on
the
charge
of
he
sent
a
diamond
ring
from
his
own
finger
of
the
value
of
to
the
queen
to
show
that
he
bore
her
no
personal
he
had
been
always
a
steadfast
catholic
his
wife
had
been
maid
of
honour
to
mary
and
a
friend
of
elizabeth
on
august
the
eighth
he
suffered
the
abominable
punishment
prescribed
he
was
drawn
on
a
hurdle
to
the
gate
of
the
bishop
palace
in
paul
churchyard
where
he
had
affixed
the
bull
hanged
upon
a
new
gallows
cut
down
before
he
was
unconscious
disembowelled
and
quartered
his
name
has
since
been
placed
on
the
roll
of
the
blessed
by
the
apostolic
see
in
whose
quarrel
he
so
cheerfully
laid
down
his
life
news
of
these
and
such
events
continued
of
course
to
be
eagerly
sought
after
by
the
papists
all
over
the
kingdom
and
the
maxwells
down
at
great
keynes
kept
in
as
close
touch
with
the
heart
of
affairs
as
almost
any
private
persons
in
the
kingdom
out
of
town
sir
nicholas
was
one
of
those
fiery
natures
to
whom
opposition
or
pressure
is
as
oil
to
flame
he
began
at
once
to
organise
his
forces
and
prepare
for
the
struggle
that
was
bound
to
come
he
established
first
a
kind
of
private
post
to
london
and
to
other
catholic
houses
round
for
purposes
however
of
defence
rather
than
offence
so
that
if
any
steps
were
threatened
he
and
his
friends
might
be
aware
of
the
danger
in
time
there
was
great
sorrow
at
the
news
of
john
felton
death
and
mass
was
said
for
his
soul
almost
immediately
in
the
little
oratory
at
maxwell
court
by
one
of
the
concealed
priests
who
went
chiefly
between
hampshire
and
sussex
ministering
to
the
catholics
of
those
districts
mistress
margaret
spent
longer
than
ever
at
her
prayers
lady
maxwell
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
her
husband
from
some
furious
act
of
fanatical
retaliation
for
john
felton
death
some
useless
provocation
of
the
authorities
the
children
at
the
dower
house
began
to
come
to
the
hall
less
often
not
because
they
were
less
welcomed
but
because
there
was
a
constraint
in
the
air
all
seemed
preoccupied
conversations
ceased
abruptly
on
their
entrance
and
fits
of
abstraction
would
fall
from
time
to
time
upon
their
kindly
hosts
in
the
meanwhile
too
the
preparations
for
james
maxwell
departure
which
had
already
begun
to
show
themselves
were
now
pushed
forward
rapidly
and
one
morning
in
the
late
summer
when
isabel
came
up
to
the
hall
she
found
that
lady
maxwell
was
confined
to
her
room
and
could
not
be
seen
that
day
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
sir
nicholas
face
as
he
quickly
crossed
the
entrance
hall
that
made
her
draw
back
from
daring
to
intrude
on
such
grief
and
on
inquiry
found
that
james
had
ridden
away
that
morning
and
that
the
servants
did
not
know
when
to
expect
him
back
nor
what
was
his
destination
in
other
ways
also
at
this
time
did
sir
nicholas
actively
help
on
his
party
great
keynes
was
in
a
convenient
position
and
circumstances
for
agents
who
came
across
from
the
continent
it
was
sufficiently
near
london
yet
not
so
near
to
the
highroad
or
to
london
itself
as
to
make
disturbance
probable
and
its
very
quietness
under
the
spiritual
care
of
a
moderate
minister
like
dent
and
its
serenity
owing
to
the
secret
sympathy
of
many
of
the
villagers
and
neighbours
as
well
as
from
the
personal
friendship
between
sir
nicholas
and
the
master
of
the
dower
house
an
undoubted
protestant
all
these
circumstances
combined
to
make
maxwell
hall
a
favourite
for
priests
and
agents
from
the
continent
strangers
on
horseback
or
in
carriages
and
sometimes
even
on
foot
would
arrive
there
after
nightfall
and
leave
in
a
day
or
two
for
london
its
nearness
to
london
enabled
them
to
enter
the
city
at
any
hour
they
thought
best
after
ten
or
eleven
in
the
forenoon
they
came
on
very
various
businesses
some
priests
even
stayed
there
and
made
the
hall
a
centre
for
their
spiritual
ministrations
for
miles
round
others
came
with
despatches
from
abroad
some
of
which
were
even
addressed
to
great
personages
at
court
and
at
the
embassies
where
much
was
being
done
by
the
ambassadors
at
this
time
to
aid
their
comrades
in
the
faith
and
to
other
leading
catholics
and
others
again
came
with
pamphlets
printed
abroad
for
distribution
in
england
some
of
them
indeed
seditious
but
many
of
them
purely
controversial
and
hortatory
and
with
other
devotional
articles
and
books
such
as
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
in
england
and
might
not
be
exposed
for
public
sale
in
booksellers
shops
agnus
deis
beads
hallowed
incense
and
crosses
were
being
sent
in
large
numbers
from
abroad
and
were
eagerly
sought
after
by
the
papists
in
all
directions
it
was
remarkable
that
while
threatening
clouds
appeared
to
be
gathering
on
all
sides
over
the
catholic
cause
yet
the
deepening
peril
was
accompanied
by
a
great
outburst
of
religious
zeal
it
was
reported
to
the
archbishop
that
massing
was
greatly
on
the
increase
in
kent
and
was
attributed
singularly
enough
to
the
northern
rebellion
which
had
ended
in
disaster
for
the
papists
but
the
very
fact
that
such
a
movement
could
take
place
at
all
probably
heartened
many
secret
sympathisers
who
had
hitherto
considered
themselves
almost
alone
in
a
heretic
population
sir
nicholas
came
in
one
day
to
dinner
in
a
state
of
great
fury
one
of
his
couriers
had
just
arrived
with
news
from
london
and
the
old
man
came
in
fuming
and
resentful
what
hypocrisy
he
cried
out
to
lady
maxwell
and
mistress
margaret
who
were
seated
at
table
not
content
with
persecuting
catholics
they
will
not
even
allow
us
to
say
we
are
persecuted
for
the
faith
here
is
the
lord
keeper
declaring
in
the
star
chamber
that
no
man
is
to
be
persecuted
for
his
private
faith
but
only
for
his
public
acts
and
that
the
grace
desires
nothing
so
little
as
to
meddle
with
any
man
conscience
then
i
suppose
they
would
say
that
hearing
mass
was
a
public
act
and
therefore
unlawful
but
then
how
if
a
man
private
faith
bids
him
to
hear
mass
is
not
that
meddling
with
his
private
conscience
to
forbid
him
to
go
to
mass
what
folly
is
this
and
yet
my
lord
keeper
and
her
grace
are
no
fools
then
are
they
worse
than
fools
lady
maxwell
tried
to
quiet
the
old
man
for
the
servants
were
not
out
of
the
room
and
it
was
terribly
rash
to
speak
like
that
before
them
but
he
would
not
be
still
nor
sit
down
but
raged
up
and
down
before
the
hearth
growling
and
breaking
out
now
and
again
what
especially
he
could
not
get
off
his
mind
was
that
this
was
the
old
religion
that
was
prescribed
that
england
for
generations
had
held
the
faith
and
that
then
the
faith
and
all
that
it
involved
had
been
declared
unlawful
was
to
him
iniquity
unfathomable
he
could
well
understand
some
new
upstart
sect
being
persecuted
but
not
the
old
religion
he
kept
on
returning
to
this
have
they
so
far
forgotten
the
old
faith
as
to
think
it
can
be
held
in
a
man
private
conscience
without
appearing
in
his
life
like
their
miserable
damnable
new
fangled
justification
by
faith
without
works
or
that
a
man
can
believe
in
the
blessed
sacrament
of
the
altar
and
yet
not
desire
to
receive
it
or
in
penance
and
yet
not
be
absolved
or
in
peter
and
yet
not
say
so
nor
be
reconciled
you
may
believe
say
they
of
their
clemency
what
you
like
be
justified
by
that
that
is
enough
bah
however
mere
declaiming
against
the
government
was
barren
work
and
sir
nicholas
soon
saw
that
and
instead
threw
himself
with
more
vigour
than
ever
into
entertaining
and
forwarding
the
foreign
emissaries
mary
corbet
had
returned
to
london
by
the
middle
of
july
and
hubert
was
not
yet
returned
so
sir
nicholas
and
the
two
ladies
had
the
hall
to
themselves
now
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
old
man
had
neither
the
nature
nor
the
training
for
the
of
a
conspirator
even
of
the
mildest
description
he
was
so
exceedingly
impulsive
unsuspicious
and
passionate
that
it
would
have
been
the
height
of
folly
to
entrust
him
with
any
weighty
secret
if
it
was
possible
to
dispense
with
him
but
the
catholics
over
the
water
needed
stationary
agents
so
grievously
and
sir
nicholas
name
commanded
such
respect
and
his
house
such
conveniences
that
they
overlooked
the
risk
involved
in
making
him
their
confidant
again
and
again
besides
it
need
not
be
said
that
his
honour
and
fidelity
was
beyond
reproach
and
those
qualities
after
all
balance
favourably
against
a
good
deal
of
shrewdness
and
discretion
he
of
course
was
serenely
unable
to
distinguish
between
sedition
and
religion
and
entertained
political
meddlers
and
ordinary
priests
with
an
equal
enthusiasm
it
was
pathetic
to
lady
maxwell
to
see
her
simple
old
husband
shuffling
away
his
papers
and
puzzling
over
cyphers
and
perpetually
leaving
the
key
of
them
lying
about
and
betraying
again
and
again
when
he
least
intended
it
by
his
mysterious
becks
and
nods
and
glances
and
oracular
sayings
that
some
scheme
was
afoot
she
could
have
helped
him
considerably
if
he
had
allowed
her
but
he
had
an
idea
that
the
capacities
of
ladies
in
general
went
no
further
than
their
harps
their
embroidery
and
their
devotions
and
besides
he
was
chivalrously
unwilling
that
his
wife
should
be
in
any
way
privy
to
business
that
involved
such
risks
as
this
one
sunny
morning
in
august
he
came
into
her
room
early
just
as
she
was
finishing
her
prayers
and
announced
the
arrival
of
an
emissary
from
abroad
sweetheart
he
said
will
you
prepare
the
east
chamber
for
a
young
man
whom
we
will
call
stewart
if
you
please
who
will
arrive
he
hopes
to
be
with
us
until
after
dusk
when
he
will
leave
and
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
no
no
my
dear
i
will
order
the
horses
myself
the
old
man
then
bustled
off
to
the
stableyard
and
ordered
a
to
be
taken
at
once
to
cuckfield
accompanied
by
a
groom
on
another
horse
these
were
to
arrive
at
the
inn
and
await
orders
from
a
stranger
whom
you
will
call
stewart
if
you
please
stewart
was
to
change
horses
there
and
ride
on
to
maxwell
hall
and
sir
nicholas
further
ordered
the
same
two
horses
and
the
same
groom
to
be
ready
the
following
evening
at
about
nine
and
to
be
at
stewart
orders
again
as
before
this
behaviour
of
sir
nicholas
was
of
course
most
culpably
indiscreet
a
child
could
not
but
have
suspected
something
and
the
grooms
who
were
of
course
catholics
winked
merrily
at
one
another
when
the
back
was
turned
and
he
had
hastened
in
a
transport
of
zeal
and
preoccupation
back
again
to
the
house
to
interrupt
his
wife
in
her
preparations
for
the
guest
that
evening
stewart
arrived
according
to
arrangements
he
was
a
slim
man
not
above
thirty
years
of
age
the
kind
of
man
his
enemies
would
call
foxy
with
a
very
courteous
and
deliberate
manner
and
he
spoke
with
a
slight
scotch
accent
he
had
the
air
of
doing
everything
on
purpose
he
let
his
fall
as
he
greeted
lady
maxwell
in
the
entrance
hall
but
picked
it
up
with
such
a
dignified
grace
that
you
would
have
sworn
he
had
let
it
fall
for
some
wise
reason
of
his
own
he
had
a
couple
of
with
him
which
he
did
not
let
out
of
his
sight
for
a
moment
even
keeping
his
eye
upon
them
as
he
met
the
ladies
and
saluted
them
they
were
carried
up
to
the
east
chamber
directly
their
owner
following
where
supper
had
been
prepared
there
was
no
real
reason
since
he
arrived
with
such
publicity
why
he
should
not
have
supped
downstairs
but
sir
nicholas
had
been
peremptory
it
was
by
his
directions
also
that
the
arrival
had
been
accomplished
in
the
manner
it
had
after
he
had
supped
sir
nicholas
receiving
the
dishes
from
the
hands
at
the
door
of
the
room
with
the
same
air
of
secrecy
and
despatch
his
host
suggested
that
he
should
come
to
lady
maxwell
as
the
ladies
were
anxious
to
see
him
stewart
asked
leave
to
bring
a
little
valise
with
him
that
had
travelled
in
one
of
the
bags
and
then
followed
his
host
who
preceded
him
with
a
shaded
light
along
the
gallery
when
he
entered
he
bowed
again
profoundly
with
a
slightly
french
air
to
the
ladies
and
to
the
image
over
the
fire
and
then
seated
himself
and
asked
leave
to
open
his
valise
he
did
so
with
their
permission
and
displayed
to
them
the
numerous
devotional
articles
and
books
that
it
contained
the
ladies
and
sir
nicholas
were
delighted
and
set
aside
at
once
some
new
books
of
devotion
and
then
they
fell
to
talk
the
netherlands
from
which
stewart
had
arrived
two
days
before
on
the
east
coast
were
full
at
this
time
of
catholic
refugees
under
the
duke
of
alva
protection
here
they
had
been
living
some
of
them
even
from
elizabeth
accession
and
sir
nicholas
and
his
ladies
had
many
inquiries
to
make
about
their
acquaintances
many
of
which
stewart
was
able
to
satisfy
for
from
his
conversation
he
was
plainly
one
in
the
confidence
of
catholics
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
so
the
evening
passed
away
quietly
it
was
thought
better
by
sir
nicholas
that
stewart
should
not
be
present
at
the
evening
devotions
that
he
always
conducted
for
the
household
in
the
unless
indeed
a
priest
were
present
to
take
his
place
so
stewart
was
again
conducted
with
the
same
secrecy
to
the
east
chamber
and
sir
nicholas
promised
at
his
request
to
look
in
on
him
again
after
prayers
when
prayers
were
over
sir
nicholas
went
up
to
his
guest
room
and
found
him
awaiting
him
in
a
state
of
evident
excitement
very
unlike
the
quiet
vivacity
and
good
humour
he
had
shown
when
with
the
ladies
sir
nicholas
he
said
standing
up
as
his
host
came
in
i
have
not
told
you
all
my
news
and
when
they
were
both
seated
he
proceeded
you
spoke
a
few
minutes
ago
sir
nicholas
of
storey
he
has
been
caught
the
old
man
exclaimed
with
dismay
stewart
went
on
when
i
left
antwerp
sir
nicholas
storey
was
in
the
town
i
saw
him
myself
in
the
street
by
the
cathedral
only
a
few
hours
before
i
embarked
he
is
very
old
you
know
and
lame
worn
out
with
good
works
and
he
was
hobbling
down
the
street
on
the
arm
of
a
young
man
when
i
arrived
at
yarmouth
i
went
out
into
the
streets
about
a
little
business
i
had
with
a
bookseller
before
taking
horse
i
heard
a
great
commotion
down
near
the
docks
at
the
entrance
of
bridge
street
and
hastened
down
there
and
there
i
saw
pursuivants
and
seamen
and
officers
all
gathered
about
a
carriage
and
keeping
back
the
crowd
that
was
pressing
and
crying
out
to
know
who
the
man
was
and
presently
the
carriage
drove
by
me
scattering
the
crowd
and
i
could
see
within
and
there
sat
old
storey
very
white
and
but
steady
and
cheerful
whom
i
had
seen
the
very
day
before
in
antwerp
now
this
is
very
grievous
for
storey
and
i
pray
god
to
deliver
him
but
surely
the
duke
and
the
king
of
spain
must
move
now
they
can
not
leave
him
in
cecil
hands
and
then
sir
nicholas
we
must
all
be
ready
for
who
knows
what
may
happen
sir
nicholas
was
greatly
moved
there
was
one
of
the
perplexities
which
so
much
harassed
all
the
papists
at
this
time
it
seemed
certain
that
stewart
prediction
must
be
fulfilled
storey
was
a
naturalised
subject
of
king
philip
and
in
the
employment
of
alva
and
he
had
been
carried
off
forcibly
by
the
english
government
it
afterwards
came
out
how
it
had
been
done
he
had
been
lured
away
from
antwerp
and
enticed
on
board
a
trader
at
by
cecil
agents
with
the
help
of
a
traitor
named
parker
on
pretext
of
finding
heretical
books
there
arriving
from
england
and
as
soon
as
he
had
set
foot
on
deck
he
was
hurried
below
and
carried
straight
off
to
yarmouth
here
then
was
sir
nicholas
perplexity
to
welcome
spain
when
she
intervened
and
to
work
actively
for
her
was
treason
against
his
country
to
act
against
spain
was
to
delay
the
of
the
religion
something
that
appeared
to
him
very
like
treason
against
his
faith
was
the
dreadful
choice
between
his
sovereign
and
his
god
he
wondered
as
he
paced
up
and
down
and
questioned
stewart
even
now
imminent
the
whole
affair
too
was
so
formidable
and
so
mysterious
that
the
hearts
of
these
catholics
and
of
others
in
england
when
they
heard
the
tale
began
to
fail
them
had
the
government
then
so
long
an
arm
and
so
keen
an
eye
and
if
it
was
able
to
hale
a
man
from
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
at
antwerp
and
the
protection
of
the
duke
of
alva
into
the
hands
of
pursuivants
at
yarmouth
within
the
space
of
a
few
hours
who
then
was
safe
and
so
the
two
sat
late
that
night
in
the
east
chamber
and
laid
schemes
and
discussed
movements
and
probabilities
and
the
like
until
the
dawn
began
to
glimmer
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutters
and
the
birds
to
chirp
in
the
eaves
and
sir
nicholas
at
last
carried
to
bed
with
him
an
anxious
and
a
heavy
heart
stewart
however
did
not
seem
so
greatly
disturbed
possibly
because
on
the
one
side
he
had
not
others
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
life
involved
in
these
complex
issues
and
partly
because
he
at
any
rate
has
not
the
weight
of
suspense
and
indecision
that
so
drew
his
host
two
ways
at
once
for
stewart
was
committed
already
and
knew
well
how
he
would
act
should
the
choice
present
itself
between
elizabeth
and
philip
the
following
morning
sir
nicholas
still
would
not
allow
his
guest
to
come
downstairs
and
insisted
that
all
his
meals
should
be
served
in
the
east
chamber
while
he
himself
as
before
received
the
food
at
the
door
and
set
it
before
stewart
stewart
was
greatly
impressed
and
touched
by
the
kindness
of
the
old
man
although
not
by
his
capacity
for
conspiracy
he
had
intended
indeed
to
tell
his
host
far
more
than
he
had
done
of
the
movements
of
political
and
religious
events
for
he
could
not
but
believe
before
his
arrival
that
a
catholic
so
prominent
and
influential
as
sir
nicholas
was
becoming
by
reputation
among
the
refugees
abroad
was
a
proper
person
to
be
entrusted
even
with
the
highest
secrets
but
after
a
very
little
conversation
with
him
the
night
before
he
had
seen
how
ingenuous
the
old
man
was
with
his
laughable
attempts
at
secrecy
and
his
lamentable
lack
of
discretion
and
so
he
had
contented
himself
with
general
information
and
gossip
and
had
really
told
sir
nicholas
very
little
indeed
of
any
importance
after
dinner
sir
nicholas
again
conducted
his
guest
to
the
where
the
ladies
were
ready
to
receive
him
he
had
obtained
permission
the
night
before
to
tell
his
wife
and
the
news
about
storey
and
the
four
sat
for
several
hours
together
discussing
the
situation
stewart
was
able
to
tell
them
too
in
greater
detail
the
story
of
lord
sussex
punitive
raid
into
scotland
in
the
preceding
april
they
had
heard
of
course
the
main
outline
of
the
story
with
the
kind
of
embroideries
attached
that
were
usual
in
those
days
of
inaccurate
reporting
but
their
guest
was
a
scotchman
himself
and
had
had
the
stories
in
some
cases
from
those
rendered
homeless
by
the
raid
who
had
fled
to
the
netherlands
where
he
had
met
them
briefly
the
raid
was
undertaken
on
the
pretended
plea
of
an
invitation
from
the
king
men
or
adherents
of
the
infant
james
but
in
reality
to
chastise
scotland
and
reduce
it
to
servility
sussex
and
lord
hunsdon
in
the
east
lord
scrope
on
the
west
had
harried
burnt
and
destroyed
in
the
whole
countryside
about
the
borders
especially
had
tiviotdale
suffered
altogether
it
was
calculated
that
sussex
had
burned
three
hundred
villages
and
blown
up
fifty
castles
and
forty
more
strong
houses
some
of
these
latter
however
being
little
more
than
border
peels
stewart
accounts
were
the
more
moving
in
that
he
spoke
in
a
quiet
delicate
tone
and
used
little
picturesque
phrases
in
his
speech
twelve
years
ago
said
stewart
i
was
at
branxholme
myself
it
was
a
pleasant
house
well
furnished
and
appointed
fortified
too
as
all
need
to
be
in
that
country
with
sheaves
of
pikes
in
all
the
lower
rooms
and
sir
walter
scott
gave
me
a
warm
welcome
for
i
was
there
on
a
business
that
pleased
him
he
showed
me
the
gardens
and
orchards
all
green
and
sweet
like
these
of
yours
lady
maxwell
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
home
where
a
man
might
be
content
to
spend
all
his
days
well
my
lord
sussex
has
been
a
visitor
there
now
and
what
he
has
left
of
the
house
would
not
shelter
a
cow
nor
what
is
left
of
the
pleasant
gardens
sustain
her
at
least
so
one
of
the
scots
told
me
whom
i
met
in
the
netherlands
in
june
he
talked
too
of
the
extraordinary
scenes
of
romance
and
chivalry
in
which
mary
queen
of
scots
moved
during
her
captivity
under
lord
care
at
bolton
castle
in
the
previous
year
he
had
met
in
his
travels
in
france
one
of
her
undistinguished
adherents
who
had
managed
to
get
a
position
in
the
castle
during
her
detention
there
the
country
was
alive
with
her
worshippers
said
stewart
they
swarmed
like
bees
round
a
hive
in
the
night
voices
would
be
heard
crying
out
to
her
grace
out
of
the
darkness
round
the
castle
and
when
the
guards
rode
out
they
would
find
no
man
but
maybe
hear
just
a
laugh
or
two
her
men
would
lie
out
at
night
and
watch
her
window
for
she
would
never
go
to
rest
till
late
and
pray
towards
it
as
if
it
were
a
light
before
the
blessed
sacrament
when
she
rode
out
with
her
guards
of
course
about
her
and
my
lord
scrope
or
sir
francis
knollys
never
far
away
a
beggar
maybe
would
be
sitting
out
on
the
road
and
ask
an
alms
and
cry
out
save
your
grace
but
he
would
be
a
beggar
who
was
accustomed
to
wear
silk
next
his
skin
except
when
he
went
many
young
gentlemen
there
were
yes
and
old
ones
too
who
would
thank
god
for
a
blow
or
a
curse
from
some
foul
english
trooper
for
his
meat
if
only
he
might
have
a
look
from
the
queen
eyes
for
his
grace
before
meat
oh
they
would
plot
too
and
scheme
and
lie
awake
half
the
night
spinning
their
webs
not
to
catch
her
grace
indeed
but
to
get
her
away
from
that
old
spider
scrope
and
many
the
word
and
the
scrap
of
paper
that
would
go
in
to
her
grace
right
under
the
very
noses
of
my
lord
scrope
and
sir
francis
themselves
as
they
sat
at
their
chess
in
the
queen
chamber
it
a
long
game
of
chess
that
the
two
queens
are
playing
but
thank
our
lady
and
the
saints
it
not
mate
yet
not
mate
yet
and
the
white
queen
will
win
please
god
before
the
and
he
told
them
too
of
the
failure
of
the
northern
rebellion
and
the
wretchedness
of
the
fugitives
they
rode
over
the
moors
to
liddisdale
he
said
ladies
and
all
in
bitter
weather
wind
and
snow
day
after
day
with
stories
of
troopers
all
about
them
and
scarcely
time
for
bite
or
sup
or
sleep
my
lady
northumberland
was
so
overcome
with
weariness
and
sickness
that
she
could
ride
no
more
at
last
and
had
to
be
left
at
house
where
she
had
a
little
chamber
where
the
snow
came
in
at
one
corner
and
the
rats
ran
over
my
lady
face
as
she
lay
my
lords
northumberland
and
westmoreland
were
in
worse
case
and
spent
their
christmas
with
no
roof
over
them
but
what
they
could
find
out
in
the
braes
and
woods
about
harlaw
and
no
clothes
but
the
foul
rags
that
some
beggar
had
thrown
away
and
no
food
but
a
bird
or
a
rabbit
that
they
could
pick
up
here
and
there
or
what
their
friends
could
get
to
them
now
and
again
privately
and
then
my
lord
northumberland
little
daughters
whom
he
was
forced
to
leave
behind
at
topcliff
a
sweet
christmas
they
had
their
money
and
food
was
soon
spent
they
could
have
scarcely
a
fire
in
that
bitter
hard
season
and
god
who
feeds
the
ravens
alone
knows
how
they
were
sustained
and
for
entertainment
to
make
the
time
pass
merrily
all
they
had
was
to
see
the
hanging
of
their
own
servants
in
scores
about
the
house
who
had
served
them
and
their
father
well
and
all
their
music
at
night
was
the
howling
of
the
wind
in
those
heavily
laden
and
the
noise
of
the
chains
in
which
the
men
were
hanged
stewart
narratives
were
engrossing
to
the
two
ladies
and
sir
nicholas
they
had
never
come
so
close
to
the
struggles
of
the
catholics
in
the
north
before
and
although
the
northern
rebellion
had
ended
so
disastrously
yet
it
was
encouraging
although
heartbreaking
too
to
hear
that
delicate
women
and
children
were
ready
gladly
to
suffer
such
miseries
if
the
religious
cause
that
was
so
dear
to
them
could
be
thereby
helped
sir
nicholas
as
has
been
said
was
in
two
minds
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
rising
against
a
temporal
sovereign
in
defence
of
religious
liberties
his
whole
english
nature
revolted
against
it
and
yet
so
many
spiritual
persons
seemed
to
favour
it
his
simple
conscience
was
perplexed
but
none
the
less
he
could
listen
with
the
most
intense
interest
and
sympathy
to
these
tales
of
these
of
his
own
who
were
so
clearly
convinced
of
their
right
to
rebel
in
defence
of
their
faith
and
so
with
such
stories
the
august
afternoon
passed
away
it
was
a
thundery
day
which
it
would
have
been
pleasanter
to
spend
in
the
garden
but
that
sir
nicholas
said
under
the
circumstances
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
they
threw
the
windows
wide
to
catch
the
least
breath
of
air
and
the
smell
of
the
came
sweetly
up
and
flooded
the
low
cool
room
and
so
they
sat
engrossed
until
the
evening
supper
was
ordered
for
stewart
at
seven
and
this
meal
sir
nicholas
had
consented
should
be
laid
downstairs
in
his
own
private
room
opening
out
of
the
hall
and
that
he
and
his
ladies
should
sit
down
to
table
at
the
same
time
stewart
went
to
his
room
an
hour
before
to
dress
for
riding
and
to
superintend
the
packing
of
his
and
at
seven
he
was
conducted
downstairs
by
sir
nicholas
who
insisted
on
carrying
the
with
his
own
hands
and
they
found
the
two
ladies
waiting
for
them
in
the
panelled
study
that
had
one
window
giving
upon
the
terrace
that
ran
along
the
south
of
the
house
above
the
garden
when
supper
had
been
brought
in
by
sir
nicholas
own
boyd
they
sat
down
to
supper
after
a
grace
from
sir
nicholas
the
horses
were
ordered
for
nine
chapter
vii
the
door
in
the
on
the
morning
of
the
day
after
stewart
secret
arrival
at
maxwell
hall
the
rector
was
walking
up
and
down
the
lawn
that
adjoined
the
churchyard
he
had
never
yet
wholly
recovered
from
the
sneers
of
mistress
corbet
the
wounds
had
healed
but
had
not
ceased
to
smart
how
blind
these
papists
were
he
thought
how
prejudiced
for
the
old
trifling
details
of
worship
how
ignorant
of
the
vital
principles
still
retained
the
old
realities
of
god
and
the
faith
and
the
church
were
with
them
still
in
this
village
he
reminded
himself
it
was
only
the
incrustations
of
error
that
had
been
removed
of
course
the
transition
was
difficult
and
hearts
were
sore
but
the
eternal
god
can
be
patient
but
then
if
the
discontent
of
the
papists
smouldered
on
one
side
the
fanatical
and
irresponsible
zeal
of
the
puritans
flared
on
the
other
how
difficult
he
thought
to
steer
the
safe
middle
course
how
much
cool
faith
and
clearsightedness
it
needed
he
reminded
himself
of
archbishop
parker
who
now
held
the
rudder
and
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
of
his
wise
moderation
in
dealing
with
excesses
his
patient
pertinacity
among
the
whirling
gusts
of
passion
that
enabled
him
to
wait
upon
events
to
push
his
schemes
and
his
tender
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
in
spite
of
these
reassuring
facts
dent
was
anxious
what
could
even
the
archbishop
do
when
his
suffragans
were
such
poor
creatures
and
when
leicester
the
strongest
man
at
court
was
a
violent
puritan
partisan
the
rector
would
have
been
content
to
bear
the
troubles
of
his
own
flock
and
household
if
he
had
been
confident
of
the
larger
cause
but
the
vagaries
of
the
puritans
threatened
all
with
ruin
that
morning
only
he
had
received
a
long
account
from
a
fellow
of
his
own
college
of
corpus
christi
cambridge
and
a
man
of
the
same
views
as
himself
of
the
violent
controversy
raging
there
at
that
time
the
professor
wrote
his
friend
referring
to
thomas
cartwright
is
plastering
us
all
with
his
genevan
ways
we
are
all
papists
it
seems
he
would
have
neither
bishop
nor
priest
nor
archbishop
nor
dean
nor
archdeacon
nor
dignitaries
at
all
but
just
the
plain
godly
minister
as
he
names
it
or
if
he
has
the
bishop
and
the
deacon
they
are
to
be
the
and
the
of
the
scripture
and
not
the
papish
counterfeits
then
it
seems
that
the
minister
is
to
be
made
not
by
god
but
by
man
that
the
people
are
to
make
him
not
the
bishop
as
if
the
sheep
should
make
the
shepherd
then
it
appears
we
are
papists
too
for
kneeling
at
the
communion
this
he
names
a
superstition
then
he
would
have
all
men
reside
in
their
benefices
or
vacate
them
and
all
that
do
not
so
it
appears
are
no
better
than
thieves
or
robbers
and
so
he
rages
on
breathing
out
this
smoky
stuff
and
all
the
young
men
do
run
after
him
as
if
he
were
the
very
pillar
of
fire
to
lead
them
to
canaan
one
day
he
says
there
shall
be
no
bishop
and
my
lord
of
ely
rides
through
petty
cury
with
scarce
a
man
found
to
doff
cap
and
say
lord
save
foolish
like
myself
another
day
he
will
have
no
distinction
of
apparel
and
the
young
sparks
straight
dress
like
ministers
and
the
ministers
like
young
sparks
on
another
he
likes
not
saint
peter
his
day
and
none
will
go
to
church
he
would
have
us
all
to
be
little
master
calvins
if
he
could
have
his
way
with
us
but
the
master
of
trinity
has
sent
a
complaint
to
the
council
with
charges
against
him
and
has
preached
against
him
too
but
no
word
hath
yet
come
from
the
council
and
we
fear
nought
will
be
done
to
the
sore
injury
of
christ
his
holy
church
and
the
protestant
religion
and
the
triumphing
of
their
pestilent
heresies
so
the
caustic
divine
wrote
and
the
rector
of
great
keynes
was
as
he
walked
up
and
down
and
read
everywhere
it
was
the
same
story
the
extreme
precisians
openly
flouted
the
religion
of
the
church
of
england
submitted
to
episcopal
ordination
as
a
legal
necessity
and
then
mocked
at
it
refused
to
wear
the
prescribed
dress
and
repudiated
all
other
distinctions
too
in
meats
and
days
as
judaic
remnants
denounced
all
forms
of
worship
except
those
directly
sanctioned
by
scripture
in
short
they
remained
in
the
church
of
england
and
drew
her
pay
while
they
scouted
her
orders
and
derided
her
claims
further
they
cried
out
as
persecuted
martyrs
whenever
it
was
proposed
to
insist
that
they
should
observe
their
obligations
but
worse
than
all
for
such
conscientious
clergymen
as
dent
was
the
fact
that
bishops
preferred
such
men
to
livings
and
at
the
same
time
were
energetic
against
the
papist
party
it
was
not
that
there
was
not
an
abundance
of
disciplinary
machinery
ready
at
the
bishop
disposal
or
that
the
queen
was
opposed
to
coercion
rather
she
was
always
urging
them
to
insist
upon
conformity
but
it
seemed
rather
to
such
sober
men
as
the
rector
that
the
principle
of
authority
had
been
lost
with
the
rejection
of
the
papacy
and
that
anarchy
rather
than
liberty
had
prevailed
in
the
national
church
in
darker
moments
it
seemed
to
him
and
his
friends
as
if
any
wild
fancy
was
tolerated
so
long
as
it
did
not
approximate
too
closely
to
the
old
religion
and
they
grew
sick
at
heart
it
was
all
the
more
difficult
for
the
rector
as
he
had
so
little
sympathy
in
the
place
his
wife
did
all
she
could
to
destroy
friendly
relations
between
the
hall
and
the
rectory
and
openly
derided
her
husband
prelatical
leanings
the
maxwells
themselves
disregarded
his
priestly
claims
and
the
villagers
thought
of
him
as
an
official
paid
to
promulgate
the
new
state
religion
the
only
house
where
he
found
sympathy
and
help
was
the
dower
house
and
as
he
paced
up
and
down
his
garden
now
his
little
perplexed
determined
face
grew
brighter
as
he
made
up
his
mind
to
see
norris
again
in
the
afternoon
during
his
meditations
he
heard
and
saw
indistinctly
through
the
shrubbery
that
fenced
the
lawn
from
the
drive
a
mounted
man
ride
up
to
the
rectory
door
he
supposed
it
was
some
message
and
held
himself
in
readiness
to
be
called
into
the
house
but
after
a
minute
or
two
he
heard
the
man
ride
off
again
down
the
drive
into
the
village
at
dinner
he
mentioned
it
to
his
wife
who
answered
rather
shortly
that
it
was
a
message
for
her
and
he
let
the
matter
drop
for
fear
of
giving
offence
he
was
terrified
at
the
thought
of
provoking
more
quarrels
than
were
absolutely
necessary
soon
after
dinner
he
put
on
his
cap
and
gown
and
to
his
wife
inquiries
told
her
where
he
was
going
and
that
after
he
had
seen
norris
he
would
step
on
down
to
comber
where
was
a
sick
body
or
two
and
that
she
might
expect
him
back
not
earlier
than
five
she
nodded
without
speaking
and
he
went
out
she
watched
him
down
the
drive
from
the
window
and
then
went
back
to
her
business
with
an
odd
expression
norris
whom
he
found
already
seated
at
his
books
again
after
dinner
took
him
out
when
he
had
heard
his
errand
and
the
two
began
to
walk
up
and
down
together
on
the
raised
walk
that
ran
along
under
a
line
of
pines
a
little
way
from
the
house
the
rector
had
seldom
found
his
friend
more
sympathetic
and
tender
he
knew
very
well
that
their
intellectual
and
doctrinal
standpoints
were
different
but
he
had
not
come
for
anything
less
than
spiritual
help
and
that
he
found
he
told
him
all
his
heart
and
then
waited
while
the
other
with
his
thin
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
his
great
grey
eyes
cast
up
at
the
heavy
pines
and
the
tender
sky
beyond
began
to
comfort
the
minister
you
are
troubled
my
friend
he
said
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
by
the
turbulence
of
these
times
on
all
sides
are
fightings
and
fears
of
course
i
can
not
as
you
know
regard
these
matters
you
have
spoken
of
episcopacy
ceremonies
at
the
communion
and
the
like
in
the
grave
light
in
which
you
see
them
but
i
take
it
if
i
understand
you
rightly
that
it
is
the
confusion
and
lack
of
any
authority
or
respect
for
antiquity
that
is
troubling
you
more
you
feel
yourself
in
a
sad
plight
between
these
raging
waves
tossed
to
and
fro
battered
upon
by
both
sides
forsaken
and
despised
and
disregarded
now
indeed
although
i
do
not
stand
quite
where
you
do
yet
i
see
how
great
the
stress
must
be
but
if
i
may
say
so
to
a
minister
it
is
just
what
you
regard
as
your
shame
that
i
regard
as
your
glory
it
is
the
mark
of
the
cross
that
is
on
your
life
when
our
saviour
went
to
his
passion
he
went
in
the
same
plight
as
that
in
which
you
go
both
jew
and
gentile
were
against
him
on
this
side
and
that
his
claims
were
disallowed
his
royalty
denied
he
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
he
did
not
go
to
his
passion
as
to
a
splendid
triumph
bearing
his
pain
like
some
solemn
and
mysterious
dignity
at
which
the
world
wondered
and
was
silent
but
he
went
battered
and
spat
upon
with
the
sweat
and
the
blood
and
the
spittle
running
down
his
face
contemned
by
the
contemptible
hated
by
the
hateful
rejected
by
the
outcast
barked
upon
by
the
curs
and
it
was
that
that
made
his
passion
so
bitter
to
go
to
death
however
painful
with
honour
and
applause
or
at
least
with
the
silence
of
respect
were
easy
it
is
not
hard
to
die
upon
a
throne
but
to
live
on
a
dunghill
with
job
that
is
bitterness
now
again
i
must
protest
that
i
have
no
right
to
speak
like
this
to
a
minister
but
since
you
have
come
to
me
i
must
needs
say
what
i
think
and
it
is
this
that
some
wise
man
once
said
honour
for
shame
is
not
far
off
covet
shame
for
honour
is
surely
to
follow
if
that
be
true
of
the
philosopher
how
much
more
true
is
it
of
the
christian
minister
whose
profession
it
is
to
follow
the
saviour
and
to
be
made
like
unto
him
he
said
much
more
of
the
same
kind
and
his
soft
balmy
faith
soothed
the
minister
wounds
and
braced
his
will
the
rector
could
not
help
half
envying
his
friend
living
as
it
seemed
in
this
still
retreat
apart
from
wrangles
and
controversy
with
the
peaceful
music
and
sweet
fragrance
of
the
pines
and
the
love
of
god
about
him
when
he
had
finished
he
asked
the
rector
to
step
indoors
with
him
and
there
in
his
own
room
took
down
and
read
to
him
a
few
extracts
from
the
german
mystics
that
he
thought
bore
upon
his
case
finally
to
put
him
at
his
ease
again
for
it
seemed
an
odd
reversal
that
he
should
be
coming
for
comfort
to
his
parishioners
norris
told
him
about
his
two
children
and
in
his
turn
asked
his
advice
about
anthony
he
said
i
am
not
at
all
anxious
i
know
that
the
boy
fancies
himself
in
love
and
goes
sighing
about
when
he
is
at
home
but
he
sleeps
and
eats
heartily
for
i
have
observed
him
and
i
think
mistress
corbet
has
a
good
heart
and
means
no
harm
to
him
but
about
my
daughter
i
am
less
satisfied
for
i
have
been
watching
her
closely
she
is
quiet
and
good
and
above
all
she
loves
the
saviour
but
how
do
i
know
that
her
heart
is
not
bleeding
within
she
has
been
taught
to
hold
herself
in
and
not
to
show
her
feelings
and
that
i
think
is
as
much
a
drawback
sometimes
as
wearing
the
heart
upon
the
sleeve
dent
suggested
sending
her
away
for
a
visit
for
a
month
or
two
his
host
mused
a
moment
and
then
said
that
he
himself
had
thought
of
that
and
now
that
his
minister
said
so
too
probably
under
god
that
was
what
was
needed
the
fact
that
hubert
was
expected
home
soon
was
an
additional
reason
and
he
had
friends
in
northampton
he
said
to
whom
he
could
send
her
they
hold
strongly
by
the
genevan
theology
there
he
said
smiling
but
i
think
that
will
do
her
no
harm
as
a
balance
to
the
popery
at
maxwell
hall
they
talked
a
few
minutes
more
and
when
the
minister
rose
to
take
his
leave
norris
slipped
down
on
his
knees
as
if
it
was
the
natural
thing
to
do
and
as
if
the
minister
were
expecting
it
and
asked
his
guest
to
engage
in
prayer
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
done
so
probably
because
this
talk
had
brought
them
nearer
together
spiritually
than
ever
before
the
minister
was
taken
aback
and
repeated
a
collect
or
two
from
the
then
they
said
the
lord
prayer
together
and
then
norris
without
any
affectation
engaged
in
a
short
extempore
prayer
asking
for
light
in
these
dark
times
and
peace
in
the
storm
and
begging
the
blessing
of
god
upon
the
village
and
upon
their
shepherd
to
whom
thou
hast
given
to
drink
of
the
cup
of
thy
passion
and
upon
his
own
children
and
lastly
upon
himself
the
chief
of
sinners
and
the
least
of
thy
servants
that
is
not
worthy
to
be
called
thy
friend
it
touched
dent
exceedingly
and
he
was
yet
more
touched
and
reconciled
to
the
incident
when
his
host
said
simply
remaining
on
his
knees
with
eyes
closed
and
his
clear
cut
tranquil
face
upturned
i
ask
your
blessing
sir
the
rector
voice
trembled
a
little
as
he
gave
it
and
then
with
real
gratitude
and
a
good
deal
of
sincere
emotion
he
shook
his
friend
hand
and
rustled
out
from
the
cool
house
into
the
sunlit
garden
greeting
isabel
who
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
a
little
pensively
and
took
the
that
led
towards
the
hamlet
where
his
sick
folk
were
expecting
him
as
he
walked
back
about
five
towards
the
village
he
noticed
there
was
thunder
in
the
air
and
was
aware
of
a
physical
oppression
but
in
his
heart
it
was
morning
and
the
birds
singing
the
talk
earlier
in
the
afternoon
had
shown
him
how
in
the
midst
of
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
to
find
the
fragrance
where
the
saviour
lips
had
rested
and
that
was
joy
to
him
and
again
his
true
pastor
heart
had
been
gladdened
by
the
way
his
ministrations
had
been
received
that
afternoon
a
sour
old
man
who
had
always
scowled
at
him
for
an
upstart
in
his
foolish
old
desire
to
be
loyal
to
the
priest
who
had
held
the
benefice
before
him
had
melted
at
last
and
asked
his
pardon
and
god
for
having
treated
him
so
ill
and
he
had
prepared
the
old
man
for
death
with
great
contentment
to
them
both
and
had
left
him
at
peace
with
god
and
man
on
looking
back
on
it
all
afterwards
he
was
convinced
that
god
had
thus
strengthened
him
for
the
trouble
that
was
awaiting
him
at
home
he
had
hardly
come
into
his
study
when
his
wife
entered
with
a
strange
look
breathing
quick
and
short
she
closed
the
door
and
stood
near
it
looking
at
him
apprehensively
george
she
said
rather
sharply
and
nervously
you
must
not
be
vexed
with
me
but
well
he
said
heavily
and
the
warmth
died
out
of
his
heart
he
knew
something
terrible
impended
i
have
done
it
for
the
best
she
said
and
obstinacy
and
a
kind
of
impatient
tenderness
strove
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
you
must
show
yourself
a
man
it
is
not
fitting
that
loose
ladies
of
the
court
should
mock
he
got
up
and
his
eyes
were
determined
too
tell
me
what
you
have
done
woman
he
cried
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
hold
him
still
and
her
voice
rang
hard
and
thin
i
will
say
my
say
she
said
it
is
not
for
that
that
i
have
done
it
but
you
are
a
and
must
be
faithful
the
justice
is
here
i
sent
for
him
the
justice
he
said
blankly
but
his
heart
was
beating
heavily
in
his
throat
frankland
from
east
grinsted
with
a
couple
of
pursuivants
and
a
company
of
servants
there
is
a
popish
agent
at
the
hall
and
they
are
come
to
take
him
the
rector
swallowed
with
difficulty
once
or
twice
and
then
tried
to
speak
but
she
went
on
and
i
have
promised
that
you
shall
take
them
in
by
the
side
door
i
will
not
he
cried
she
held
up
her
hand
again
for
silence
and
glanced
round
at
the
door
i
have
given
him
the
key
she
said
this
was
the
private
key
possessed
by
the
incumbent
for
generations
past
and
sir
nicholas
had
not
withdrawn
it
from
the
protestant
rector
there
is
no
choice
she
said
oh
george
be
a
man
then
she
turned
and
slipped
out
he
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
his
pulses
were
racing
he
could
not
think
he
sat
down
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
gradually
his
brain
cleared
and
quieted
then
he
realised
what
it
meant
and
his
soul
rose
in
blind
furious
resentment
this
was
the
last
straw
it
was
the
woman
devilish
jealousy
but
what
could
he
do
the
justice
was
here
could
he
warn
his
friends
he
clenched
his
fingers
into
his
hair
as
the
situation
came
out
clear
and
hard
before
his
brain
dear
god
what
could
he
do
there
were
footsteps
in
the
flagged
hall
and
he
raised
his
head
as
the
door
opened
and
a
portly
gentleman
in
came
in
followed
by
dent
the
rector
rose
confusedly
but
could
not
speak
and
his
eyes
wandered
round
to
his
wife
again
and
again
as
she
took
a
chair
in
the
shadow
and
sat
down
but
the
magistrate
noticed
nothing
aha
he
said
beaming
you
have
a
wife
sir
that
is
a
jewel
solomon
never
spoke
a
truer
word
an
ornament
to
her
husband
he
said
i
think
but
you
as
a
minister
should
know
better
than
i
a
mere
layman
and
his
face
creased
with
mirth
what
did
the
fool
mean
thought
the
rector
if
only
he
would
not
talk
so
loud
he
must
think
he
must
think
what
could
he
do
she
was
very
brisk
sir
the
magistrate
went
on
sitting
down
and
the
rector
followed
his
example
sitting
too
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
his
hand
to
his
head
then
frankland
went
on
with
his
talk
and
the
man
sat
there
still
glancing
from
time
to
time
mechanically
towards
his
wife
who
was
there
in
the
shadow
with
steady
white
face
and
hands
in
her
lap
watching
the
two
men
the
magistrate
voice
seemed
to
the
bewildered
man
to
roll
on
like
a
wheel
over
stones
interminable
grinding
stupefying
what
was
he
saying
what
was
that
about
his
wife
she
had
sent
to
him
the
day
before
had
she
and
told
him
of
the
popish
agent
coming
ah
a
dangerous
man
was
he
a
spreader
of
seditious
pamphlets
at
least
they
supposed
he
was
the
yes
yes
he
understood
these
were
threateners
of
the
whole
commonwealth
they
must
be
hunted
out
like
vermin
just
so
and
he
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
should
be
the
first
to
just
so
he
agreed
with
all
his
heart
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
yes
but
dear
lord
what
was
he
to
do
this
fat
man
with
the
face
of
a
butcher
must
not
be
allowed
to
ah
what
was
that
he
had
missed
that
would
frankland
be
so
good
as
to
say
it
again
yes
yes
he
understood
now
the
men
were
posted
already
no
one
suspected
anything
they
had
come
by
the
bridle
every
door
did
he
understand
that
every
door
of
the
hall
was
watched
ah
that
was
prudent
there
was
no
chance
then
of
any
one
sending
a
warning
in
oh
no
no
he
did
not
dream
for
a
moment
that
there
was
any
concealed
catholic
who
would
be
likely
to
do
such
a
thing
but
he
only
yes
yes
the
magistrate
was
right
one
could
not
be
too
careful
because
ah
what
was
that
about
sir
nicholas
yes
yes
indeed
he
was
a
good
landlord
and
very
popular
in
the
ah
just
so
it
had
better
be
done
quietly
at
the
side
door
yes
that
was
the
one
which
the
key
fitted
but
but
he
thought
perhaps
he
had
better
not
come
in
because
sir
nicholas
was
his
friend
and
there
was
no
use
in
making
bad
oh
not
to
the
house
very
well
then
he
would
come
as
far
as
the
yew
hedge
at
at
what
time
did
the
magistrate
say
at
eight
yes
that
would
be
best
as
frankland
said
because
sir
nicholas
had
ordered
the
horses
for
nine
so
they
would
come
upon
them
just
at
the
right
how
many
men
did
frankland
say
eight
oh
yes
eight
and
himself
and
he
did
not
quite
follow
the
plan
ah
through
the
yew
hedge
on
to
the
terrace
and
through
the
south
door
into
the
hall
then
if
they
bolted
they
surely
he
had
understood
the
magistrate
to
say
there
was
only
one
oh
he
had
not
understood
that
sir
nicholas
too
but
why
why
good
god
as
a
harbourer
of
priests
no
but
this
fellow
was
an
agent
surely
well
if
the
magistrate
said
so
of
course
he
was
right
but
he
would
have
thought
himself
that
sir
nicholas
might
have
been
left
ah
well
he
would
say
no
more
he
quite
saw
the
magistrate
point
no
no
he
was
no
favourer
god
forbid
his
wife
would
speak
for
him
as
to
that
marion
would
bear
well
well
he
thanked
the
magistrate
for
his
compliments
and
would
he
proceed
with
the
plan
by
the
south
door
he
was
saying
yes
into
the
yes
the
east
room
was
sir
nicholas
study
or
of
course
they
might
be
supping
upstairs
but
it
made
no
difference
no
the
magistrate
was
right
about
that
so
long
as
they
held
the
main
staircase
and
had
all
the
other
doors
watched
they
were
safe
to
have
no
no
the
cloister
wing
would
not
be
used
they
might
leave
that
out
of
their
calculations
besides
did
not
the
magistrate
say
that
marion
had
seen
the
lights
in
the
east
wing
last
night
yes
well
that
settled
and
the
signal
oh
he
had
not
caught
that
the
church
bell
was
it
to
be
but
what
for
why
did
they
need
a
signal
ah
he
understood
for
the
advance
at
just
so
he
would
send
thomas
up
to
ring
it
would
marion
kindly
see
to
that
yes
indeed
his
wife
was
a
woman
to
be
proud
of
such
a
faithful
protestant
no
patience
with
these
seditious
rogues
at
all
well
was
that
all
was
there
anything
else
yes
how
dark
it
was
getting
it
must
be
close
on
eight
thomas
had
gone
had
he
that
was
all
and
had
the
men
everything
they
wanted
well
yes
although
the
village
did
go
to
bed
early
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
have
no
lights
because
there
was
no
need
to
rouse
oh
very
well
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
frankland
to
go
and
sit
with
the
men
and
keep
them
quiet
and
his
wife
would
go
too
just
to
make
sure
they
had
all
they
very
well
yes
he
would
wait
here
in
the
dark
until
he
was
called
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
thank
you
then
the
door
had
closed
and
the
man
left
alone
flung
himself
down
in
his
chair
and
buried
his
face
again
in
his
arms
ah
what
was
to
be
done
nothing
nothing
nothing
and
there
they
were
at
the
hall
his
neighbours
and
friends
the
kind
old
catholic
and
his
ladies
how
would
he
ever
dare
to
meet
their
eyes
again
but
what
could
be
done
nothing
how
far
away
the
afternoon
seems
that
quiet
sunny
walk
beneath
the
pines
his
friend
is
at
his
books
no
doubt
with
the
silver
candles
and
the
open
pages
and
his
own
neat
manuscript
growing
under
his
white
scholarly
fingers
and
isabel
at
her
needlework
before
the
how
peaceful
and
harmless
and
sweet
it
all
is
and
down
there
not
fifty
yards
away
is
the
village
every
light
out
by
now
and
the
children
and
parents
too
ah
what
will
the
news
be
when
they
wake
and
that
strange
talk
this
afternoon
of
the
saviour
and
his
cup
of
pain
and
the
squalor
and
indignity
of
the
passion
ah
yes
he
could
suffer
with
jesus
on
the
cross
so
gladly
on
that
tree
of
life
but
not
with
judas
on
the
tree
of
death
and
the
minister
dropped
his
face
lower
over
the
edge
of
his
desk
and
the
hot
tears
of
misery
and
and
impotence
began
to
run
there
was
no
help
no
help
anywhere
all
were
against
him
even
his
wife
herself
and
his
lord
then
with
a
moan
he
lifted
his
hot
face
into
the
dusk
jesus
he
cried
in
his
soul
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
there
came
a
tapping
on
the
door
and
the
door
opened
an
inch
it
is
time
whispered
his
wife
voice
chapter
viii
the
taking
of
stewart
they
were
still
sitting
over
the
at
the
hall
the
sun
had
set
about
the
time
they
had
begun
and
the
twilight
had
deepened
into
dark
but
they
had
not
cared
to
close
the
shutters
as
they
were
to
move
so
soon
the
four
candles
shone
out
through
the
windows
and
there
still
hung
a
pale
glimmer
outside
owing
to
the
refraction
of
light
from
the
white
stones
of
the
terrace
beyond
on
the
left
there
sloped
away
a
high
black
wall
of
impenetrable
darkness
where
the
yew
hedge
stood
over
that
was
the
starless
sky
sir
nicholas
study
was
bright
with
candlelight
and
the
lace
and
jewels
of
lady
maxwell
for
her
sister
wore
none
added
a
vague
pleasant
sense
of
beauty
to
stewart
mind
for
he
was
one
who
often
fared
coarsely
and
slept
hard
he
sighed
a
little
to
himself
as
he
looked
out
over
this
shining
past
the
genial
smiling
face
of
sir
nicholas
to
the
dark
outside
and
thought
how
in
less
than
an
hour
he
would
have
left
the
comfort
of
this
house
for
the
grey
road
and
its
hardships
again
it
was
extraordinarily
sweet
to
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
taste
and
a
natural
inclination
to
luxury
to
stay
a
day
or
two
now
and
again
at
a
house
like
this
and
mix
again
with
his
own
equals
instead
of
with
the
rough
company
of
the
village
inn
or
the
curious
foreign
conspirators
with
their
absence
of
educated
perception
and
their
doubtful
cleanliness
he
was
a
man
of
domestic
instincts
and
good
birth
and
breeding
and
would
have
been
perfectly
at
his
ease
as
the
master
of
some
household
such
as
this
with
a
chapel
and
a
library
and
a
pleasant
garden
and
estate
spending
his
days
in
great
leisure
and
good
deeds
and
instead
of
all
this
scarcely
by
his
own
choice
but
by
what
he
would
have
called
his
vocation
he
was
partly
an
exile
living
from
hand
to
mouth
in
lodgings
and
inns
and
when
he
was
in
his
own
fatherland
a
hunted
fugitive
lurking
about
in
unattractive
disguises
he
sighed
again
once
or
twice
there
was
silence
a
moment
or
two
there
sounded
one
note
from
the
church
tower
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
lady
maxwell
heard
it
and
looked
suddenly
up
she
scarcely
knew
why
and
caught
her
sister
eyes
glancing
at
her
there
was
a
shade
of
uneasiness
in
them
it
is
thundery
said
sir
nicholas
stewart
did
not
speak
lady
maxwell
looked
up
quickly
at
him
as
he
sat
on
her
right
facing
the
window
and
saw
an
expression
of
slight
disturbance
cross
his
face
he
was
staring
out
on
to
the
quickly
darkening
terrace
past
sir
nicholas
who
with
pursed
lips
and
a
little
frown
was
stripping
off
his
grapes
from
the
stalk
the
look
of
uneasiness
deepened
and
the
young
man
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
sat
down
again
what
is
it
mr
stewart
said
lady
maxwell
and
her
voice
had
a
ring
of
terror
in
it
sir
nicholas
looked
up
quickly
eh
eh
he
began
the
young
man
rose
up
and
recoiled
a
step
still
staring
out
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
but
i
have
just
seen
several
men
pass
the
window
there
was
a
rush
of
footsteps
and
a
jangle
of
voices
outside
in
the
hall
and
as
the
four
rose
up
from
table
looking
at
one
another
there
was
a
rattle
at
the
handle
outside
the
door
flew
open
and
a
ruddy
man
stood
there
with
a
slightly
apprehensive
air
and
holding
a
loaded
cane
a
little
ostentatiously
in
his
hand
the
faces
of
several
men
looked
over
his
shoulder
sir
nicholas
ruddy
face
had
paled
his
mouth
was
half
open
with
dismay
and
he
stared
almost
unintelligently
at
the
magistrate
hand
closed
on
the
handle
of
a
knife
that
lay
beside
his
plate
in
the
queen
name
said
frankland
and
looked
from
the
knife
to
the
young
man
white
determined
face
and
down
again
a
little
sobbing
broke
from
lady
maxwell
it
is
useless
sir
said
the
magistrate
sir
nicholas
persuade
your
guest
not
to
make
a
useless
resistance
we
are
ten
to
one
the
house
has
been
watched
for
hours
sir
nicholas
took
a
step
forward
his
mouth
closed
and
opened
again
lady
maxwell
took
a
swift
rustling
step
from
behind
the
table
and
threw
her
arm
round
the
old
man
neck
still
none
of
them
spoke
come
in
said
the
magistrate
turning
a
little
the
men
outside
filed
in
to
the
number
of
half
a
dozen
and
two
or
three
more
were
left
in
the
hall
all
were
armed
mistress
margaret
who
had
stood
up
with
the
rest
sat
down
again
and
rested
her
head
on
her
hand
apparently
completely
at
her
ease
i
must
beg
pardon
lady
maxwell
he
went
on
but
my
duty
leaves
me
no
choice
he
turned
to
the
young
man
who
on
seeing
the
officers
had
laid
the
knife
down
again
and
now
stood
with
one
hand
on
the
table
rather
pale
but
apparently
completely
looking
a
little
disdainfully
at
the
magistrate
then
sir
nicholas
made
a
great
effort
but
his
face
twitched
as
he
spoke
and
the
hand
that
he
lifted
to
his
wife
arm
shook
with
nervousness
and
his
voice
was
cracked
and
unnatural
sit
down
my
dear
sit
what
is
all
this
i
do
not
mr
frankland
sir
what
do
you
want
of
me
and
who
are
all
these
gentlemen
wo
you
sit
down
frankland
and
take
a
glass
of
wine
let
me
make
stewart
known
to
you
and
he
lifted
a
shaking
hand
as
if
to
introduce
them
the
magistrate
smiled
a
little
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
it
is
no
use
sir
nicholas
he
said
this
gentleman
i
fear
is
well
known
to
some
of
us
no
no
sir
he
cried
sharply
the
window
is
guarded
stewart
who
had
looked
swiftly
and
sideways
across
at
the
window
faced
the
magistrate
again
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
sir
he
said
it
was
a
lad
who
passed
the
window
there
was
a
movement
outside
in
the
hall
and
the
magistrate
stepped
to
the
door
who
is
there
he
cried
out
sharply
there
was
a
scuffle
and
a
cry
of
a
boy
voice
and
a
man
appeared
holding
anthony
by
the
arm
mistress
margaret
turned
round
in
her
seat
and
said
in
a
perfectly
natural
voice
why
anthony
my
lad
there
was
a
murmur
from
one
or
two
of
the
men
silence
called
out
the
magistrate
we
will
finish
the
other
affair
first
and
he
made
a
motion
to
hold
anthony
for
a
now
then
do
any
of
you
men
know
this
gentleman
a
pursuivant
stepped
out
frankland
sir
i
know
him
under
two
names
chapman
and
wode
he
is
a
popish
agent
i
saw
him
in
the
company
of
storey
in
antwerp
four
months
ago
stewart
blew
out
his
lips
sharply
and
contemptuously
pooh
he
said
and
then
turned
to
the
man
and
bowed
ironically
i
congratulate
you
my
man
he
said
in
a
tone
of
bitter
triumph
in
april
i
was
in
france
kindly
remember
this
man
words
frankland
they
will
tell
in
my
favour
for
i
presume
you
mean
to
take
me
i
will
remember
them
said
the
magistrate
stewart
bowed
to
him
he
had
completely
regained
his
composure
then
he
turned
to
sir
nicholas
and
lady
maxwell
who
had
been
watching
in
a
bewildered
silence
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
he
said
for
having
brought
this
annoyance
on
you
lady
maxwell
but
these
men
are
so
sharp
that
they
see
nothing
but
guilt
everywhere
i
do
not
know
yet
what
my
crime
is
but
that
can
wait
sir
nicholas
we
should
have
parted
anyhow
in
half
an
hour
we
shall
only
say
here
instead
of
at
the
door
the
magistrate
smiled
again
as
before
and
half
put
up
his
hand
to
hide
it
i
beg

pardon

but

lady
maxwell
drew
a
quick
hissing
breath
her
sister
got
up
swiftly
and
went
to
her
as
she
sat
down
in
sir
nicholas
chair
still
holding
the
old
man
hand
sir
nicholas
turned
to
his
guest
and
his
voice
broke
again
and
again
as
he
spoke
stewart
he
said
i
am
sorry
that
any
guest
of
mine
should
be
subject
to
these
insults
however
i
am
glad
that
i
shall

the
pleasure
of

he
added
harshly
to
the
magistrate
who
bowed
to
then
may
i
have
my
servant
sir
presently
said
frankland
and
then
turned
to
anthony
who
had
been
staring
at
the
scene
now
who
is
this
a
man
answered
from
the
rank
that
is
master
anthony
norris
sir
ah
and
who
is
master
anthony
norris
a
papist
too
no
sir
said
the
man
again
a
good
protestant
and
the
son
of
norris
at
the
dower
house
ah
said
the
magistrate
again
judicially
and
what
might
you
be
wanting
here
master
anthony
norris
anthony
explained
that
he
often
came
up
in
the
evening
and
that
he
wanted
nothing
the
magistrate
eyed
him
a
moment
or
two
well
i
have
nothing
against
you
young
gentleman
but
i
can
not
let
you
go
till
i
am
safely
set

rouse
the
village
take
him
out
till
we
start
he
added
to
the
man
who
guarded
him
come
this
way
sir
said
the
officer
and
anthony
presently
found
himself
sitting
on
the
long
oak
bench
that
ran
across
the
western
end
of
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
just
opposite
the
door
of
sir
nicholas
room
where
he
had
just
witnessed
that
curious
startling
scene
the
man
who
had
charge
of
him
stood
a
little
distance
off
and
did
not
trouble
him
further
and
anthony
watched
in
silence
the
hall
was
still
dark
except
for
one
candle
that
had
been
lighted
by
the
magistrate
party
and
it
looked
sombre
and
suggestive
of
tragedy
floor
walls
and
ceiling
were
all
dark
oak
and
the
corners
were
full
of
shadows
a
streak
of
light
came
out
of
the
slightly
opened
door
opposite
and
a
murmur
of
voices
the
rest
of
the
house
was
quiet
it
had
all
been
arranged
and
carried
out
without
disturbance
anthony
had
a
very
fair
idea
of
what
was
going
forward
he
knew
of
course
that
the
catholics
were
always
under
suspicion
and
now
understood
plainly
enough
from
the
conversation
he
had
heard
that
the
young
man
standing
so
alert
and
cheerful
by
the
table
in
there
had
somehow
precipitated
matters
anthony
himself
had
come
up
on
some
trifling
errand
and
had
run
straight
into
this
affair
and
now
he
sat
and
wondered
resentfully
with
his
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
there
were
men
at
all
the
inner
doors
now
they
had
slipped
in
from
the
outer
entrances
as
soon
as
word
had
reached
them
that
the
prisoners
were
secured
and
only
a
couple
were
left
outside
to
prevent
the
alarm
being
raised
in
the
village
these
inner
sentinels
stood
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
rose
up
into
the
unlighted
lobby
overhead
at
the
door
that
led
to
the
inner
hall
and
the
servants
quarters
and
at
those
that
led
to
the
cloister
wing
and
the
garden
respectively
the
murmur
of
voices
went
on
in
the
room
opposite
and
presently
a
man
slipped
out
and
passed
through
the
sentinels
to
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchens
and
pantry
he
carried
a
pike
in
his
hand
and
was
armed
with
a
steel
cap
and
in
a
minute
he
had
returned
followed
by
boyd
sir
nicholas
the
two
passed
into
the
study
and
a
moment
later
the
dark
inner
hall
was
full
of
moving
figures
and
rustlings
and
whisperings
as
the
alarmed
servants
poured
up
from
downstairs
then
the
study
door
opened
again
and
anthony
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
lighted
room
the
two
ladies
with
sir
nicholas
and
his
guest
were
seated
at
table
there
was
the
figure
of
an
armed
man
behind
chair
and
another
behind
lady
maxwell
then
the
door
closed
again
as
boyd
with
the
magistrate
and
a
constable
carrying
a
candle
came
out
this
way
sir
said
the
servant
and
the
three
crossed
the
hall
and
passing
close
by
anthony
went
up
the
broad
oak
staircase
that
led
to
the
upper
rooms
then
the
minutes
passed
away
from
upstairs
came
the
noise
of
doors
opening
and
shutting
and
footsteps
passing
overhead
from
the
inner
hall
the
sound
of
low
talking
and
a
few
sobs
now
and
again
from
a
frightened
maid
from
sir
nicholas
room
all
was
quiet
except
once
when
stewart
laugh
high
and
natural
rang
out
anthony
thought
of
that
strong
brisk
face
he
had
seen
in
the
candlelight
and
wondered
how
he
could
laugh
with
death
so
imminent
and
worse
than
death
and
a
warmth
of
admiration
and
respect
glowed
at
the
lad
heart
the
man
by
anthony
sighed
and
shifted
his
feet
what
is
it
for
whispered
the
lad
at
last
i
must
speak
to
you
sir
said
the
man
at
last
the
footsteps
overhead
came
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
magistrate
voice
called
out
sharply
and
impatiently
come
along
come
along
and
the
three
all
carrying
bags
and
valises
came
downstairs
again
and
crossed
the
hall
again
the
door
opened
as
they
went
in
leaving
the
luggage
on
the
floor
and
anthony
caught
another
glimpse
of
the
four
still
seated
round
the
table
but
sir
nicholas
head
was
bowed
upon
his
hands
then
again
the
door
closed
and
there
was
silence
once
more
it
was
flung
open
and
anthony
saw
the
interior
of
the
room
plainly
the
four
were
standing
up
stewart
was
bowing
to
lady
maxwell
the
magistrate
stood
close
beside
him
then
a
couple
of
men
stepped
up
to
the
young
man
side
as
he
turned
away
and
the
three
came
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
waiting
by
the
little
heap
of
luggage
frankland
came
next
with
the
close
beside
him
and
the
rest
of
the
men
behind
and
the
last
closed
the
door
and
stood
by
it
there
was
a
dead
silence
anthony
sprang
to
his
feet
in
uncontrollable
excitement
what
was
happening
again
the
door
opened
and
the
men
made
room
as
mistress
margaret
came
out
and
the
door
shut
she
came
swiftly
across
with
her
little
air
of
dignity
and
confidence
towards
anthony
who
was
standing
forward
why
master
anthony
she
said
dear
lad
i
did
not
know
they
had
kept
you
and
she
took
his
hand
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
whispered
sharply
hush
she
said
and
the
two
stood
together
in
silence
the
moments
passed
anthony
could
hear
the
quick
thumping
beat
of
his
own
heart
and
the
breathing
of
mistress
margaret
but
the
hall
was
perfectly
quiet
where
the
magistrate
with
the
prisoner
and
his
men
stood
in
an
irregular
dark
group
with
the
candle
behind
them
and
no
sound
came
from
the
room
beyond
then
the
handle
turned
and
a
crack
of
light
showed
but
no
further
sound
then
the
door
opened
wide
a
flood
of
light
poured
out
and
sir
nicholas
tottered
into
the
hall
margaret
margaret
he
cried
where
are
you
go
to
her
there
was
a
strange
moaning
sound
from
the
brightly
lighted
room
the
old
lady
dropped
anthony
hand
and
moved
swiftly
and
unfalteringly
across
and
once
more
the
door
closed
behind
her
there
was
a
sharp
word
of
command
from
the
magistrate
and
the
sentries
from
every
door
left
their
posts
and
joined
the
group
which
with
sir
nicholas
and
his
guest
and
boyd
in
the
centre
now
passed
out
through
the
garden
door
the
magistrate
paused
as
he
saw
anthony
standing
there
alone
i
can
trust
you
young
gentleman
he
said
not
to
give
the
alarm
till
we
are
gone
anthony
nodded
and
the
magistrate
passed
briskly
out
on
to
the
terrace
shutting
the
door
behind
him
there
was
a
rush
of
footsteps
and
a
murmur
of
voices
and
the
hall
was
filled
with
the
watching
servants
as
the
chorus
of
exclamations
and
inquiries
broke
out
anthony
ran
straight
through
the
crowd
to
the
garden
door
and
on
to
the
terrace
they
had
gone
to
the
left
he
supposed
but
he
hesitated
a
moment
to
listen
then
he
heard
the
stamp
of
horses
feet
and
the
jingle
of
saddlery
and
saw
the
glare
of
torches
through
the
yew
hedge
and
he
turned
quickly
and
ran
along
the
terrace
past
the
flood
of
light
that
poured
out
from
the
supper
room
and
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
opposite
the
rectory
it
was
very
dark
and
he
stumbled
once
or
twice
then
he
came
to
the
two
or
three
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
door
in
the
wall
and
turned
off
among
the
bushes
creeping
on
hands
and
feet
till
he
reached
the
wall
low
on
this
side
but
deep
on
the
other
and
looked
over
the
pursuivants
with
their
men
had
formed
a
circle
round
the
two
prisoners
who
were
already
mounted
and
who
sat
looking
about
them
as
the
luggage
was
being
strapped
to
their
saddles
before
and
behind
the
bridles
were
lifted
forward
over
the
horses
heads
and
a
couple
of
the
guard
held
each
rein
the
groom
who
had
brought
round
the
two
horses
for
stewart
and
himself
stood
and
staring
with
his
back
to
the
rectory
wall
the
magistrate
was
just
mounting
at
a
little
distance
his
own
horse
which
was
held
by
the
rectory
boy
boyd
it
seemed
was
to
walk
with
the
men
two
or
three
torches
were
burning
by
now
and
every
detail
was
distinct
to
anthony
as
he
crouched
among
the
dry
leaves
and
peered
down
on
to
the
group
just
beneath
sir
nicholas
face
was
turned
away
from
him
but
his
head
was
sunk
on
his
breast
and
he
did
not
stir
or
lift
it
as
his
horse
stamped
at
the
strapping
on
of
the
valise
boyd
had
packed
for
him
stewart
sat
erect
and
motionless
and
his
face
as
anthony
saw
it
was
confident
and
fearless
then
suddenly
the
door
in
the
rectory
wall
opposite
was
flung
open
and
a
figure
in
flying
black
skirts
but
hatless
rushed
out
and
through
the
guard
straight
up
to
the
old
man
knee
there
was
a
shout
from
the
men
and
a
movement
to
pull
him
off
but
the
magistrate
who
was
on
his
horse
and
just
outside
the
circle
spoke
sharply
and
the
men
fell
back
oh
sir
nicholas
sir
nicholas
sobbed
the
minister
his
face
half
buried
in
the
saddle
anthony
saw
his
shoulders
shaking
and
his
hands
clutching
at
the
old
man
knee
forgive
me
forgive
me
there
was
no
answer
from
sir
nicholas
he
still
sat
unmoved
his
chin
on
his
breast
as
the
rector
sobbed
and
moaned
at
his
stirrup
there
there
said
the
magistrate
decidedly
over
the
heads
of
the
guard
that
is
enough
dent
and
he
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
a
couple
of
men
took
the
minister
by
the
shoulders
and
drew
him
still
crying
out
to
sir
nicholas
outside
the
group
and
he
stood
there
dazed
and
groping
with
his
hands
there
was
a
word
of
command
and
the
guard
moved
off
at
a
sharp
walk
with
the
horses
in
the
centre
and
as
they
turned
the
lad
saw
in
the
torchlight
the
old
man
face
drawn
and
wrinkled
with
sorrow
and
great
tears
running
down
it
the
rector
leaned
against
his
own
wall
with
his
hands
over
his
face
and
anthony
looked
at
him
with
growing
suspicion
and
terror
as
the
flare
of
the
torches
on
the
trees
faded
and
the
noise
of
the
troop
died
away
round
the
corner
chapter
ix
village
justice
the
village
had
never
known
such
an
awakening
as
on
the
morning
that
followed
sir
nicholas
arrest
before
seven
every
house
knew
it
and
children
ran
to
the
outlying
hamlets
to
tell
the
story
very
little
work
was
done
that
day
for
the
estate
was
disorganised
and
the
men
had
little
heart
for
work
and
there
were
groups
all
day
on
the
green
which
formed
and
and
drifted
here
and
there
and
discussed
and
sifted
the
evidence
it
was
soon
known
that
the
rectory
household
had
had
a
foremost
hand
in
the
affair
the
groom
who
had
been
present
at
the
actual
departure
of
the
prisoners
had
told
the
story
of
the
black
figure
that
ran
out
of
the
door
and
of
what
was
cried
at
the
old
man
knee
and
how
he
had
not
moved
nor
spoken
in
answer
and
thomas
the
rectory
boy
was
stopped
as
he
went
across
the
green
in
the
evening
and
threatened
and
encouraged
until
he
told
of
the
stroke
on
the
and
the
rectory
key
and
the
little
company
that
had
sat
all
the
afternoon
in
the
kitchen
over
their
ale
he
told
too
how
a
couple
of
hours
ago
he
had
been
sent
across
with
a
note
to
lady
maxwell
and
that
it
had
been
returned
immediately
unopened
so
as
night
fell
indignation
had
begun
to
smoulder
fiercely
against
the
minister
who
had
not
been
seen
all
day
and
after
dark
had
fallen
the
name
judas
was
cried
in
at
the
rectory
door
half
a
dozen
times
and
a
stone
or
two
from
the
direction
of
the
churchyard
had
crashed
on
the
tiles
of
the
house
norris
had
been
up
all
day
at
the
hall
but
he
was
the
only
visitor
admitted
all
day
long
the
was
kept
closed
and
the
same
message
was
given
to
the
few
horsemen
and
carriages
that
came
to
inquire
after
the
truth
of
the
report
from
the
catholic
houses
round
to
the
effect
that
it
was
true
that
sir
nicholas
and
a
friend
had
been
taken
off
to
london
by
the
justice
from
east
grinsted
and
that
lady
maxwell
begged
the
prayers
of
her
friends
for
her
husband
safe
return
anthony
had
ridden
off
early
with
a
servant
at
his
father
wish
to
follow
sir
nicholas
and
learn
any
news
of
him
that
was
possible
to
do
him
any
service
he
was
able
and
to
return
or
send
a
message
the
next
day
down
to
great
keynes
and
early
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
with
the
information
that
sir
nicholas
was
at
the
marshalsea
that
he
was
well
and
happy
that
he
sent
his
wife
his
dear
love
and
that
she
should
have
a
letter
from
him
before
nightfall
he
rode
straight
to
the
hall
with
the
news
full
of
chastened
delight
at
his
official
importance
just
pausing
to
tell
a
group
that
was
gathered
on
the
green
that
all
was
well
so
far
and
was
shown
up
to
lady
maxwell
own
parlour
where
he
found
her
very
quiet
and
and
extremely
grateful
for
his
kindness
in
riding
up
to
london
and
back
on
her
account
anthony
explained
too
that
he
had
been
able
to
get
sir
nicholas
one
or
two
comforts
that
the
prison
did
not
provide
a
pillow
and
an
extra
coverlet
and
some
fruit
and
he
left
her
full
of
gratitude
his
father
had
been
up
to
see
the
ladies
two
or
three
times
and
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
religion
had
prayed
with
them
and
talked
a
little
and
lady
maxwell
had
asked
that
isabel
might
come
up
to
supper
and
spend
the
evening
norris
promised
to
send
her
up
and
then
added
i
am
a
little
anxious
lady
maxwell
lest
the
people
may
show
their
anger
against
the
rector
or
his
wife
about
what
has
happened
lady
maxwell
looked
startled
they
have
been
speaking
of
it
all
day
long
he
said
they
know
everything
and
it
seems
the
rector
is
not
so
much
to
blame
as
his
wife
it
was
she
who
sent
for
the
magistrate
and
gave
him
the
key
and
arranged
it
all
he
was
only
brought
into
it
too
late
to
interfere
or
refuse
have
you
seen
him
asked
the
old
lady
i
have
been
both
days
he
said
but
he
will
not
see
me
he
is
in
his
study
locked
in
i
may
have
treated
him
hardly
she
said
i
would
not
open
his
note
but
at
least
he
consented
to
help
them
against
his
friend
and
her
old
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
fear
that
is
so
said
the
other
sadly
but
speak
to
the
people
she
said
i
think
they
love
my
husband
and
would
do
nothing
to
grieve
us
tell
them
that
nothing
would
pain
either
of
us
more
than
that
any
should
suffer
for
this
tell
them
they
must
do
nothing
but
be
patient
and
pray
there
was
a
group
still
on
the
green
near
the
pond
as
isabel
came
up
to
supper
that
evening
about
six
her
father
who
had
given
lady
maxwell
message
to
the
people
an
hour
or
two
before
had
asked
her
to
go
that
way
and
send
down
a
message
to
him
immediately
if
there
seemed
to
be
any
disturbance
or
threatening
of
it
but
the
men
were
very
quiet
musgrave
was
there
she
saw
sitting
with
his
pipe
on
the
stocks
and
piers
the
young
irish
bailiff
was
standing
near
they
all
were
silent
as
the
girl
came
up
and
saluted
her
respectfully
as
usual
and
she
saw
no
signs
of
any
dangerous
element
there
were
one
or
two
older
women
with
the
men
and
others
were
standing
at
their
open
doors
on
all
sides
as
she
went
up
the
rectory
gate
was
locked
and
no
one
was
to
be
seen
within
supper
was
laid
in
sir
nicholas
room
as
it
generally
was
and
as
it
had
been
two
nights
ago
and
it
was
very
strange
to
isabel
to
know
that
it
was
here
that
the
arrest
had
taken
place
the
floor
too
she
noticed
as
she
came
in
all
about
the
threshold
was
scratched
and
dented
by
rough
boots
lady
maxwell
was
very
silent
and
distracted
during
supper
she
made
efforts
to
talk
again
and
again
and
her
sister
did
her
best
to
interest
her
and
keep
her
talking
but
she
always
relapsed
after
a
minute
or
two
into
silence
again
with
long
glances
round
the
room
at
the
vernacle
over
the
fireplace
the
with
the
shield
of
the
five
wounds
above
it
and
all
the
things
that
spoke
so
keenly
of
her
husband
what
a
strange
room
it
was
too
thought
isabel
with
its
odd
mingling
of
the
two
worlds
with
the
tapestry
of
the
hawking
scene
and
the
stiff
herons
and
ladies
on
horseback
on
one
side
and
the
little
shelf
of
devotional
books
on
the
other
and
yet
how
characteristic
of
its
owner
who
fingered
his
or
the
reins
of
his
horse
all
day
and
his
beads
in
the
evening
and
how
strange
that
an
old
man
like
sir
nicholas
who
knew
the
world
and
had
as
much
sense
apparently
as
any
one
else
should
be
willing
to
sacrifice
home
and
property
and
even
life
itself
for
these
so
plainly
empty
superstitious
things
that
could
not
please
a
god
that
was
spirit
and
truth
so
isabel
thought
to
herself
with
no
bitterness
or
contempt
but
just
a
simple
wonder
and
amazement
as
she
looked
at
the
painted
tokens
and
trinkets
it
was
still
daylight
when
they
went
upstairs
to
lady
maxwell
room
about
seven
but
the
clear
southern
sky
over
the
yew
hedges
and
the
tall
elms
where
the
rooks
were
circling
was
beginning
to
be
flushed
with
deep
amber
and
rose
isabel
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
with
the
sweet
air
pouring
in
and
looked
out
on
to
the
garden
with
its
tiled
paths
and
its
cool
green
squares
of
lawn
and
the
glowing
beds
at
the
sides
over
to
her
right
the
cloister
court
ran
out
with
its
two
rows
of
windows
bedrooms
above
with
galleries
beyond
as
she
knew
and
parlours
and
cloisters
below
the
pleasant
tinkle
of
the
fountain
in
the
court
came
faintly
to
her
ears
across
the
caw
of
the
rooks
about
the
elms
and
the
low
sounds
from
the
stables
and
the
kitchen
behind
the
house
otherwise
the
evening
was
very
still
the
two
old
ladies
were
sitting
near
the
fireplace
lady
maxwell
had
taken
up
her
embroidery
and
was
looking
at
it
listlessly
and
mistress
margaret
had
one
of
her
devotional
books
and
was
turning
the
pages
pausing
here
and
there
as
she
did
so
presently
she
began
to
read
without
a
word
of
introduction
one
of
the
musings
of
the
old
monk
john
audeley
in
his
sickness
and
as
the
tender
lines
stepped
on
that
restless
jewelled
hand
grew
still
as
i
lay
sick
in
my
languor
in
an
abbey
here
by
west
this
book
i
made
with
great
dolour
when
i
might
not
sleep
nor
rest
oft
with
my
prayers
my
soul
i
blest
and
said
aloud
to
heaven
king
know
o
lord
it
is
the
best
meekly
to
take
thy
visiting
else
well
i
wot
that
i
were
lorn
high
above
all
lords
be
he
blest
all
that
thou
dost
is
for
the
best
by
fault
of
thee
was
no
man
lost
that
is
here
of
woman
born
and
then
she
read
some
of
rolle
verses
to
jesus
the
friend
of
all
sick
and
sorrowful
souls
and
a
meditation
of
his
on
the
passion
and
the
tranquil
thoughts
and
tender
fragrant
sorrows
soothed
the
torn
throbbing
soul
and
isabel
saw
the
old
wrinkled
hand
rise
to
her
forehead
and
the
embroidery
with
the
needle
still
in
it
slipped
to
the
ground
as
the
holy
name
like
ointment
poured
forth
gradually
brought
its
endless
miracle
and
made
all
sweet
and
healthful
again
outside
the
daylight
was
fading
the
luminous
vault
overhead
was
deepening
to
a
glowing
blue
as
the
sunset
contracted
on
the
western
horizon
to
a
few
vivid
streaks
of
glory
the
room
was
growing
darker
every
moment
and
mistress
margaret
voice
began
to
stumble
over
words
the
great
gilt
harp
in
the
corner
only
gleamed
here
and
there
now
in
single
lines
of
clear
gold
where
the
dying
daylight
fell
on
the
strings
the
room
was
full
of
shadows
and
the
image
of
the
holy
mother
and
child
had
darkened
into
obscurity
in
their
niche
the
world
was
silent
now
too
the
rooks
were
gone
home
and
the
stir
of
the
household
below
had
ceased
and
in
a
moment
more
mistress
margaret
voice
had
ceased
too
as
she
laid
the
book
down
then
as
if
the
world
outside
had
waited
for
silence
before
speaking
there
came
a
murmur
of
sound
from
the
further
side
of
the
house
isabel
started
up
surely
there
was
anger
in
that
low
roar
from
the
village
was
it
this
that
her
father
had
feared
had
she
been
remiss
lady
maxwell
too
sprang
up
and
faced
the
window
with
wide
large
eyes
the
letter
she
said
and
took
a
quick
step
towards
the
door
but
mistress
margaret
was
with
her
instantly
with
her
arm
about
her
sit
down
mary
she
said
they
will
bring
it
at
once
and
her
sister
obeyed
and
she
sat
waiting
and
looking
towards
the
door
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
as
they
lay
on
her
lap
and
mistress
margaret
stood
by
her
waiting
and
watching
too
isabel
still
stood
by
the
window
listening
had
she
been
mistaken
then
the
roar
had
sunk
into
silence
for
a
moment
and
there
came
back
the
quick
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
outside
on
the
short
drive
between
the
gatehouse
and
the
hall
they
were
right
then
and
even
as
she
thought
it
and
as
the
wife
that
waited
for
news
of
her
husband
drew
a
quick
breath
and
half
rose
in
her
seat
at
the
sound
of
that
shod
messenger
that
bore
them
again
the
roar
swelled
up
louder
than
ever
and
isabel
sprang
down
from
the
low
step
of
the
into
the
dusky
room
where
the
two
sisters
waited
what
is
that
what
is
that
she
whispered
sharply
there
was
a
sound
of
opening
doors
and
of
feet
that
ran
in
the
house
below
and
lady
maxwell
rose
up
and
put
out
her
hand
as
a
dashed
in
with
a
letter
my
lady
he
said
panting
and
giving
it
to
her
they
are
attacking
the
rectory
lady
maxwell
who
was
to
the
window
now
for
light
to
read
her
husband
letter
paused
at
that
the
rectory
she
said
why
margaret
then
she
stopped
and
isabel
close
beside
her
saw
her
turn
resolutely
from
the
great
sealed
letter
in
her
hand
to
the
door
and
back
again
jervis
told
us
my
lady
none
saw
him
as
he
rode
through
they
were
breaking
down
the
gate
then
lady
maxwell
with
a
quick
movement
lifted
the
letter
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
and
thrust
it
down
somewhere
out
of
sight
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
come
margaret
she
said
isabel
followed
them
down
the
stairs
and
out
through
the
and
there
as
they
came
out
on
to
the
steps
that
savage
snarling
roar
swelled
up
from
the
green
there
was
laughter
and
hooting
mixed
with
that
growl
of
anger
but
even
the
laughter
was
fierce
the
gatehouse
stood
up
black
against
the
glare
of
torches
and
the
towers
threw
great
swinging
shadows
on
the
ground
and
the
steps
of
the
hall
isabel
followed
the
two
grey
glimmering
figures
and
was
astonished
at
the
speed
with
which
she
had
to
go
the
hoofs
of
the
courier
horse
rang
on
the
cobbles
of
the
as
they
came
down
towards
the
gatehouse
and
the
two
wings
of
the
door
were
through
which
he
had
passed
just
now
but
the
porter
was
gone
ah
there
was
the
crowd
but
not
at
the
rectory
on
the
right
the
rectory
gate
lay
wide
open
and
a
flood
of
light
poured
out
from
the
at
the
end
of
the
drive
before
them
lay
the
dark
turf
swarming
with
black
figures
towards
the
lower
end
and
a
ceaseless
roar
came
from
them
there
were
half
a
dozen
torches
down
there
tossing
to
and
fro
isabel
saw
that
the
crowd
was
still
moving
down
towards
the
stocks
and
the
pond
now
the
two
ladies
in
front
of
her
were
just
coming
up
with
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
and
there
was
an
exclamation
or
two
of
astonishment
as
the
women
and
children
saw
who
it
was
that
was
coming
then
there
came
the
furious
scream
of
a
man
and
the
crowd
parted
as
three
men
came
reeling
out
together
two
of
them
trying
with
all
their
power
to
restrain
a
fighting
kicking
plunging
man
in
long
black
skirts
who
tore
and
beat
with
his
hands
the
three
ladies
stopped
for
a
moment
close
together
and
simultaneously
the
struggling
man
broke
free
and
dashed
back
into
the
crowd
screaming
with
anger
and
misery
marion
marion
i
am
coming
o
god
and
isabel
saw
with
a
shock
of
horror
that
sent
her
crouching
and
clinging
close
to
mistress
margaret
that
it
was
the
rector
but
the
two
men
were
after
him
and
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
as
he
disappeared
and
as
they
turned
they
faced
lady
maxwell
my
lady
my
lady
stammered
one
we
mean
him
no
harm
we
but
his
voice
stopped
as
there
came
a
sudden
silence
rent
by
a
high
terrible
shriek
and
a
splash
followed
in
a
moment
by
a
yell
of
laughter
and
shouting
and
lady
maxwell
threw
herself
into
the
crowd
in
front
there
were
a
few
moments
of
jostling
in
the
dark
with
the
reek
and
press
of
the
crowd
about
her
and
isabel
found
herself
on
the
brink
of
the
black
pond
with
lady
maxwell
on
one
side
and
piers
on
the
other
keeping
the
crowd
back
and
a
dripping
figure
moaning
and
sobbing
in
the
trampled
mud
at
lady
maxwell
feet
there
was
silence
enough
now
and
the
ring
of
faces
opposite
stared
astonished
and
at
the
tall
old
lady
with
her
grey
veiled
head
upraised
as
she
stood
there
in
the
torchlight
and
rated
them
in
her
fearless
indignant
voice
i
am
ashamed
ashamed
cried
lady
maxwell
i
thought
you
were
men
i
thought
you
loved
my
husband
and
and
me
her
voice
broke
and
then
once
more
she
cried
again
i
am
ashamed
ashamed
of
my
village
and
then
she
stooped
to
that
heaving
figure
that
had
crawled
up
and
laid
hold
tenderly
of
the
arms
that
were
writhed
about
her
feet
come
home
my
dear
isabel
heard
her
whisper
it
was
a
strange
procession
homeward
up
the
trampled
turf
the
crowd
had
broken
into
groups
and
the
people
were
awed
and
silent
as
they
watched
the
four
women
go
back
together
isabel
walked
a
little
behind
with
her
father
and
anthony
who
had
at
last
been
able
to
come
forward
through
the
press
and
join
them
and
a
couple
of
the
torchbearers
escorted
them
in
front
went
the
three
on
one
side
lady
maxwell
her
lace
and
silk
splashed
and
spattered
with
mud
and
her
white
hands
black
with
it
and
on
the
other
the
old
nun
each
with
an
arm
thrown
round
the
woman
in
the
centre
who
staggered
and
sobbed
and
leaned
against
them
as
she
went
with
her
long
hair
and
her
draggled
clothes
streaming
with
liquid
mud
every
step
she
took
once
they
stopped
at
a
group
of
three
men
the
rector
was
sitting
up
in
his
torn
dusty
cassock
and
isabel
saw
that
one
of
his
buckled
shoes
was
gone
as
he
sat
on
the
grass
with
his
feet
before
him
but
quiet
now
with
his
hands
before
him
and
a
dazed
stupid
look
in
his
little
black
eyes
that
blinked
at
the
light
of
the
torch
that
was
held
over
him
he
said
nothing
as
he
looked
at
his
wife
between
the
two
ladies
but
his
lips
moved
and
his
eyes
wandered
for
a
moment
to
lady
maxwell
face
and
then
back
to
his
wife
take
him
home
presently
she
said
to
the
men
who
were
with
him
and
then
passed
on
again
as
they
got
through
the
gatehouse
isabel
stepped
forward
to
mistress
margaret
side
shall
i
come
she
whispered
and
the
nun
shook
her
head
so
she
with
her
father
and
brother
stood
there
to
watch
with
the
crowd
silent
and
ashamed
behind
the
two
torchbearers
went
on
and
stood
by
the
steps
as
the
three
ladies
ascended
leaving
black
footmarks
as
they
went
the
door
was
open
and
faces
of
servants
peeped
out
and
hands
were
thrust
out
to
take
the
burden
from
their
mistress
but
she
shook
her
head
and
the
three
came
in
together
and
the
door
closed
as
the
norrises
went
back
silently
the
rector
passed
them
with
a
little
group
accompanying
him
too
he
too
could
hardly
walk
alone
so
exhausted
was
he
with
his
furious
struggles
to
rescue
his
wife
take
your
sister
home
said
norris
to
anthony
and
they
saw
him
slip
off
and
pass
his
arm
through
the
rector
and
bend
down
his
handsome
kindly
face
to
the
minister
staring
eyes
and
moving
lips
as
he
too
led
him
homewards
even
anthony
was
hushed
and
impressed
and
hardly
spoke
a
word
until
he
and
isabel
turned
off
down
the
little
dark
lane
to
the
dower
house
we
could
do
nothing
he
said
father
and
i
until
lady
maxwell
came
no
said
isabel
softly
she
only
could
have
done
it
chapter
x
a
confessor
sir
nicholas
and
the
party
were
lodged
at
east
grinsted
the
night
of
their
arrest
in
the
magistrate
house
although
he
was
allowed
privacy
in
his
room
after
he
had
given
his
word
of
honour
not
to
attempt
an
escape
yet
he
was
allowed
no
conversation
with
stewart
or
his
own
servant
except
in
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
or
one
of
the
pursuivants
and
stewart
since
he
was
personally
unknown
to
the
magistrate
and
since
the
charge
against
him
was
graver
was
not
on
any
account
allowed
to
be
alone
for
a
moment
even
in
the
room
in
which
he
slept
the
following
day
they
all
rode
on
to
london
and
the
two
prisoners
were
lodged
in
the
marshalsea
this
had
been
for
a
long
while
the
place
where
bishop
bonner
was
confined
and
where
catholic
prisoners
were
often
sent
immediately
after
their
arrest
and
sir
nicholas
at
any
rate
found
to
his
joy
that
he
had
several
old
friends
among
the
prisoners
he
was
confined
in
a
separate
room
but
by
the
kindness
of
his
gaoler
whom
he
bribed
profusely
as
the
custom
was
through
his
servant
he
had
many
opportunities
of
meeting
the
others
and
even
of
approaching
the
sacraments
and
hearing
mass
now
and
then
he
began
a
letter
to
his
wife
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
and
finished
it
the
next
day
which
was
saturday
and
it
was
taken
down
immediately
by
the
courier
who
had
heard
the
news
and
had
called
at
the
prison
in
fact
he
was
allowed
a
good
deal
of
liberty
although
he
was
watched
and
his
conversation
listened
to
a
good
deal
more
than
he
was
aware
stewart
however
as
he
still
called
himself
was
in
a
much
harder
case
the
had
been
opened
on
his
arrival
and
incriminating
documents
found
besides
the
popish
trinkets
they
were
found
to
contain
a
number
of
seditious
pamphlets
printed
abroad
for
distribution
in
england
for
at
this
time
the
college
at
douai
under
its
founder
william
allen
late
principal
of
mary
hall
oxford
was
active
in
the
production
of
literature
these
were
chiefly
commentaries
on
the
bull
as
well
as
exhortations
to
the
catholics
to
stand
firm
and
to
persevere
in
recusancy
and
to
the
schismatic
catholics
as
they
were
called
to
give
over
attending
the
services
in
the
parish
churches
there
were
letters
also
from
storey
himself
whom
the
authorities
already
had
in
person
under
lock
and
key
at
the
tower
these
were
quite
sufficient
to
make
stewart
a
prize
and
he
also
was
very
shortly
afterwards
removed
to
the
tower
sir
nicholas
wrote
a
letter
at
least
once
a
week
to
his
wife
but
writing
was
something
of
a
labour
to
him
it
was
exceedingly
doubtful
to
his
mind
whether
his
letters
were
not
opened
and
read
before
being
handed
to
the
courier
and
as
his
seal
was
taken
from
him
his
wife
could
not
tell
either
however
they
seemed
to
arrive
regularly
plainly
therefore
the
authorities
were
either
satisfied
with
their
contents
or
else
did
not
think
them
worth
opening
or
suppressing
he
was
quite
peremptory
that
his
wife
should
not
come
up
to
london
it
would
only
increase
his
distress
he
said
and
he
liked
to
think
of
her
at
maxwell
hall
there
were
other
reasons
too
that
he
was
prudent
enough
not
to
commit
to
paper
and
which
she
was
prudent
enough
to
guess
at
the
principal
of
which
was
of
course
that
she
ought
to
be
there
for
the
entertaining
and
helping
of
other
agents
or
priests
who
might
be
in
need
of
shelter
the
old
man
got
into
good
spirits
again
very
soon
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
god
had
honoured
him
by
imprisonment
and
he
said
as
much
once
or
twice
in
his
letters
to
his
wife
he
was
also
pleased
with
a
sense
of
the
part
he
was
playing
in
the
of
a
conspirator
and
he
underlined
and
put
signs
and
exclamation
marks
all
over
his
letters
of
which
he
thought
his
wife
would
understand
the
significance
but
no
one
else
whereas
in
reality
the
old
lady
was
sorely
puzzled
by
them
and
the
authorities
who
opened
the
letters
generally
read
them
of
course
like
a
printed
book
one
morning
about
ten
days
after
his
arrival
the
governor
of
the
prison
looked
in
with
the
gaoler
and
announced
to
sir
nicholas
after
greeting
him
that
he
was
to
appear
before
the
council
that
very
day
this
of
course
was
what
sir
nicholas
desired
and
he
thanked
the
governor
cordially
for
his
good
news
they
will
probably
keep
you
at
the
tower
sir
nicholas
said
the
governor
and
we
shall
lose
you
however
sir
i
hope
you
will
be
more
comfortable
there
than
we
have
been
able
to
make
you
the
knight
thanked
the
governor
again
and
said
to
him
with
great
warmth
for
they
had
been
on
the
best
of
terms
with
one
another
during
his
short
detention
at
the
marshalsea
the
following
day
sir
nicholas
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
wife
describing
his
examination
we
are
in
here
at
last
sweetheart
boyd
brought
my
luggage
over
yesterday
and
i
am
settled
the
in
a
room
of
my
own
in
the
white
tower
with
a
prospect
over
the
court
i
was
had
before
my
lords
yesterday
in
the
we
drove
hither
from
the
marshalsea
there
was
a
bay
window
in
the
room
i
promise
you
they
got
little
enough
from
me
there
was
my
namesake
sir
nicholas
bacon
my
lords
leicester
and
pembroke
and
secretary
cecil
sir
james
crofts
the
controller
of
the
household
and
one
or
two
more
but
these
were
the
principal
i
was
set
before
the
table
on
a
chair
alone
with
none
to
guard
me
but
with
men
at
the
doors
i
knew
very
well
my
lords
were
very
courteous
to
me
though
they
laughed
more
than
was
seemly
at
such
grave
times
they
questioned
me
much
as
to
my
religion
was
i
a
papist
if
they
meant
by
that
a
that
i
was
and
thanked
god
for
it
every
day
those
nicknames
like
me
not
was
i
then
a
recusant
if
by
that
they
meant
did
i
go
to
their
genevan
that
i
did
not
nor
never
would
i
thought
to
have
said
a
word
here
about
cyprian
his
work
unitate
as
f
r
told
me
but
they
would
not
let
me
speak
did
i
know
chapman
if
by
that
they
meant
stewart
that
i
did
and
for
a
courteous
gentleman
too
was
he
a
papist
or
a
catholic
if
i
would
have
it
so
that
i
would
not
tell
them
let
them
find
that
out
with
their
pursuivants
and
that
crew
did
i
think
protestants
to
be
fearers
of
god
that
i
did
not
they
feared
nought
but
the
queen
majesty
so
it
seemed
to
me
then
they
all
laughed
at
once
i
know
not
why
then
they
grew
grave
and
secretary
began
to
ask
me
questions
sharp
and
hard
but
i
would
not
be
put
upon
and
answered
him
again
as
he
asked
did
i
know
ought
of
storey
nothing
said
i
save
that
he
is
a
good
catholic
and
that
they
had
taken
him
is
a
seditious
said
my
lord
pembroke
he
is
said
i
then
they
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
pope
and
his
bull
and
whether
he
can
depose
princes
i
said
i
thought
him
to
be
the
vicar
of
christ
and
as
to
his
power
to
depose
princes
that
i
supposed
he
could
do
if
he
said
so
then
two
or
three
cried
out
on
me
that
i
had
not
answered
honestly
and
at
that
i
got
wrath
and
then
they
laughed
again
at
least
i
saw
sir
james
crofts
at
it
and
secretary
looking
very
hard
at
me
asked
whether
if
philip
sent
an
armament
against
elizabeth
to
depose
her
i
would
fight
for
him
or
her
grace
for
neither
said
i
i
am
too
old
which
then
would
you
pray
said
they
the
queen
said
i
that
she
was
my
this
seemed
to
content
them
and
they
talked
a
little
among
themselves
they
had
asked
me
other
questions
too
as
to
my
way
of
living
whether
i
went
to
mass
they
asked
me
too
a
little
more
about
stewart
did
i
know
him
to
be
a
seditious
rascal
that
i
did
not
said
i
asked
they
you
come
to
receive
him
and
his
pamphlets
of
his
pamphlets
said
i
i
know
nothing
i
saw
nothing
in
his
bags
save
beads
and
a
few
holy
books
and
such
things
you
see
sweetheart
i
did
him
no
injury
by
saying
so
because
i
knew
that
they
had
his
bags
themselves
and
i
said
i
had
received
him
because
he
was
recommended
to
me
by
some
good
friends
of
mine
abroad
and
i
told
them
their
names
too
for
they
are
safe
in
flanders
now
and
when
they
had
done
their
questions
they
talked
again
for
a
while
and
i
was
sent
out
to
the
antechamber
to
refresh
myself
and
secretary
sent
a
man
with
me
to
see
that
i
had
all
i
needed
and
we
talked
together
a
little
and
he
said
the
council
were
in
good
humour
at
the
taking
of
storey
and
he
had
never
seen
them
so
merry
then
i
was
had
back
again
presently
and
secretary
said
i
was
to
stay
in
the
tower
and
that
boyd
was
gone
already
to
bring
my
things
and
so
after
that
i
went
by
water
to
the
tower
and
here
i
am
sweetheart
well
and
cheerful
praise
god
my
dearest
i
send
you
my
heart
best
love
god
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
the
council
treated
the
old
knight
very
tenderly
they
were
shrewd
enough
to
see
his
character
very
plainly
and
that
he
was
a
simple
man
who
knew
nothing
of
sedition
but
only
had
harboured
agents
thinking
them
to
be
as
guileless
as
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
stewart
was
an
agent
of
storey
and
was
therefore
implicated
in
a
number
of
very
grave
charges
this
of
course
was
a
very
serious
matter
but
both
in
the
examination
of
the
council
and
in
papers
in
stewart
bags
nothing
could
be
found
to
implicate
sir
nicholas
in
any
political
intrigue
at
all
the
authorities
were
unwilling
too
to
put
such
a
man
to
the
torture
there
was
always
a
possibility
of
public
resentment
against
the
torture
of
a
man
for
his
religion
alone
and
they
were
desirous
not
to
arouse
this
since
they
had
many
prisoners
who
would
be
more
productive
subjects
of
the
rack
than
a
plainly
simple
and
loyal
old
man
whose
only
crime
was
his
religion
they
determined
however
to
make
an
attempt
to
get
a
little
more
out
of
sir
nicholas
by
a
device
which
would
excite
no
resentment
if
it
ever
transpired
and
one
which
was
more
suited
to
the
old
man
nature
and
years
sir
nicholas
thus
described
it
to
his
wife
last
night
my
dearest
i
had
a
great
honour
and
consolation
i
was
awakened
suddenly
towards
two
in
the
morning
by
the
door
of
my
room
opening
and
a
man
coming
in
it
was
somewhat
dark
and
i
could
not
see
the
man
plainly
but
i
could
see
that
he
limped
and
walked
with
a
stick
and
he
breathed
hard
as
he
entered
i
sat
up
and
demanded
of
him
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
and
telling
me
to
be
still
he
said
that
he
was
storey
you
may
be
sure
sweetheart
that
i
sprang
up
at
that
but
he
would
not
let
me
rise
and
himself
sat
down
beside
me
he
said
that
by
the
of
a
gaoler
he
had
been
allowed
to
come
and
that
he
must
not
stay
with
me
long
that
he
had
heard
of
me
from
his
good
friend
stewart
i
asked
him
how
he
did
for
i
heard
that
he
had
been
racked
and
he
said
yes
it
was
true
but
that
by
the
mercy
of
god
and
the
prayers
of
the
saints
he
had
held
his
peace
and
they
knew
nothing
from
him
then
he
asked
me
a
great
number
of
questions
about
the
i
had
and
where
they
were
now
and
he
knew
many
of
their
names
some
of
them
were
friends
of
his
own
he
said
especially
the
priests
we
talked
a
good
while
till
the
morning
light
began
and
then
he
said
he
must
be
gone
or
the
head
gaoler
would
know
of
his
visit
and
so
he
went
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
his
face
sweetheart
for
i
think
him
a
great
servant
of
god
but
it
was
still
too
dark
when
he
went
and
we
dared
not
have
a
light
for
fear
it
should
be
seen
this
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
ruse
of
the
authorities
it
was
not
storey
at
all
who
was
admitted
to
sir
nicholas
prison
but
parker
who
had
betrayed
him
at
antwerp
it
was
so
successful
for
sir
nicholas
told
him
all
that
he
knew
which
was
really
nothing
at
all
that
it
was
repeated
a
few
months
later
with
richer
results
when
the
conspirator
baily
hysterical
and
almost
beside
himself
with
the
pain
of
the
rack
under
similar
circumstances
gave
up
a
cypher
which
was
necessary
to
the
council
in
dealing
with
the
correspondence
of
mary
stuart
however
sir
nicholas
never
knew
the
deception
and
to
the
end
of
his
days
was
proud
that
he
had
actually
met
the
famous
storey
when
they
were
both
imprisoned
in
the
tower
together
and
told
his
friends
of
it
with
reverent
pride
when
the
doctor
was
hanged
a
year
later
hubert
who
had
been
sent
for
to
take
charge
of
the
estate
had
come
to
london
soon
after
his
father
arrival
at
the
tower
and
was
allowed
an
interview
with
him
in
the
presence
of
the
lieutenant
hubert
was
greatly
affected
though
he
could
not
look
upon
the
imprisonment
with
the
same
solemn
exultation
as
that
which
his
father
had
but
it
made
a
real
impression
upon
him
to
find
that
he
took
so
patiently
this
separation
from
home
and
family
for
the
sake
of
religion
hubert
received
instructions
from
sir
nicholas
as
to
the
management
of
the
estate
for
it
was
becoming
plain
that
his
father
would
have
to
remain
in
the
tower
for
the
present
not
any
longer
on
a
really
grave
charge
but
chiefly
because
he
was
an
obstinate
recusant
and
would
promise
nothing
the
law
and
its
administration
at
this
time
were
very
far
apart
the
authorities
were
not
very
anxious
to
search
out
and
punish
those
who
were
merely
recusants
or
refused
to
take
the
oath
of
supremacy
and
so
hubert
and
boyd
and
other
catholics
were
able
to
come
and
go
under
the
very
nose
of
justice
without
any
real
risk
to
themselves
but
it
was
another
matter
to
let
a
sturdy
recusant
go
from
prison
who
stoutly
refused
to
give
any
sort
of
promise
or
understanding
as
to
future
behaviour
sir
nicholas
was
had
down
more
than
once
to
further
examination
before
the
lords
commissioners
in
the
lieutenant
house
but
it
was
a
very
tame
and
even
an
amusing
affair
for
all
save
sir
nicholas
it
was
so
easy
to
provoke
him
he
was
so
simple
and
passionate
that
they
could
get
almost
anything
they
wanted
out
of
him
by
a
little
adroit
baiting
and
more
than
once
his
examination
formed
a
welcome
and
humorous
between
two
real
tragedies
sir
nicholas
of
course
never
suspected
for
a
moment
that
he
was
affording
any
amusement
to
any
one
he
thought
their
weary
laughter
to
be
sardonic
and
ironical
and
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
very
desperate
fellow
indeed
and
wrote
glowing
accounts
of
it
all
to
his
wife
full
of
apostrophic
praises
to
god
and
the
saints
in
a
hand
that
shook
with
excitement
and
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
important
scenes
in
which
he
played
so
prominent
a
part
but
there
was
no
atmosphere
of
humour
about
stewart
he
had
disappeared
from
sir
nicholas
sight
on
their
arrival
at
the
marshalsea
and
they
had
not
set
eyes
on
one
another
since
nor
could
all
the
knight
persuasion
and
offer
of
bribes
make
his
gaoler
consent
to
take
any
message
or
scrap
of
paper
between
them
he
would
not
even
answer
more
than
the
simplest
inquiries
about
him
that
he
was
alive
and
in
the
tower
and
so
forth
and
sir
nicholas
prayed
often
and
earnestly
for
that
deliberate
and
vivacious
young
man
who
had
so
charmed
and
interested
them
all
down
at
great
keynes
and
who
had
been
so
mysteriously
engulfed
by
the
sombre
majesty
of
the
law
i
fear
he
wrote
to
lady
maxwell
i
fear
that
must
be
sick
or
dying
but
i
can
hear
no
news
of
him
when
i
am
allowed
sometimes
to
walk
in
the
court
or
on
the
leads
he
is
never
there
my
jakes
looks
glum
and
says
nothing
when
i
ask
him
how
my
friend
does
my
dearest
do
not
forget
him
in
your
prayers
nor
your
old
loving
husband
either
one
evening
late
in
october
jakes
did
not
come
as
usual
to
bring
sir
nicholas
his
supper
at
five
the
time
passed
and
still
he
did
not
come
this
was
very
unusual
presently
jakes
appeared
instead
carrying
the
food
which
she
set
down
at
the
door
while
she
turned
the
key
behind
her
sir
nicholas
rallied
her
on
having
turned
gaoler
but
she
turned
on
him
a
face
with
red
eyes
and
lined
with
weeping
o
sir
nicholas
she
said
for
these
two
were
good
friends
what
a
wicked
place
this
is
god
forgive
me
for
saying
so
but
they
had
that
young
man
down
there
since
two
and
jakes
is
with
them
to
help
and
he
told
me
to
come
up
to
you
sir
nicholas
with
your
supper
if
they
were
done
by
five
and
if
the
young
gentleman
had
said
what
they
wanted
sir
nicholas
felt
sick
who
is
it
he
asked
why
who
but
mr
stewart
she
said
and
then
fell
weeping
again
and
went
out
forgetting
to
lock
the
door
behind
her
in
her
grief
sir
nicholas
sat
still
a
moment
sick
and
shaken
he
knew
what
it
meant
but
it
had
never
come
so
close
to
him
before
he
got
up
presently
and
went
to
the
door
to
listen
for
he
knew
not
what
but
there
was
no
sound
but
the
moan
of
the
wind
up
the
draughty
staircase
and
the
sound
of
a
prisoner
singing
somewhere
above
him
a
snatch
of
a
song
he
looked
out
presently
but
there
was
nothing
but
the
dark
well
of
the
staircase
disappearing
round
to
the
left
and
the
glimmer
of
an
oil
lamp
somewhere
from
the
depths
below
him
with
wavering
shadows
as
the
light
was
blown
about
by
the
gusts
that
came
up
from
outside
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
of
course
he
closed
the
door
went
back
and
prayed
with
all
his
might
for
the
young
man
who
was
somewhere
in
this
huge
building
in
his
agony
jakes
came
up
himself
within
half
an
hour
to
see
if
all
was
well
but
said
nothing
of
his
dreadful
employment
or
of
stewart
and
sir
nicholas
did
not
like
to
ask
for
fear
of
getting
jakes
into
trouble
the
gaoler
took
away
the
supper
things
wished
him
went
out
and
locked
the
door
apparently
without
noticing
it
had
been
left
undone
before
possibly
his
mind
was
too
much
occupied
with
what
he
had
been
seeing
and
doing
and
the
faithful
account
of
all
this
went
down
in
due
time
to
great
keynes
the
arrival
of
the
courier
at
the
hall
on
wednesday
and
saturday
was
a
great
affair
both
to
the
household
and
to
the
village
sir
nicholas
sent
his
letter
generally
by
the
saturday
courier
and
the
other
brought
a
kind
of
bulletin
from
boyd
with
sometimes
a
message
or
two
from
his
master
these
letters
were
taken
by
the
ladies
first
to
the
study
as
if
to
an
oratory
and
lady
maxwell
would
read
them
slowly
over
to
her
sister
and
in
the
evening
when
isabel
generally
came
up
for
an
hour
or
two
the
girl
would
be
asked
to
read
them
slowly
all
over
again
to
the
two
ladies
who
sat
over
their
embroidery
on
either
side
of
her
and
who
interrupted
for
the
sheer
joy
of
prolonging
it
and
they
would
discuss
together
the
exact
significance
of
all
his
marks
of
emphasis
and
irony
and
the
girl
would
have
all
she
could
do
sometimes
not
to
feel
a
disloyal
amusement
at
the
transparency
of
the
devices
and
the
simplicity
of
the
loving
hearts
that
marvelled
at
the
writer
depth
and
ingenuity
but
she
was
none
the
less
deeply
impressed
by
his
courageous
cheerfulness
and
by
the
power
of
a
religion
that
in
spite
of
its
obvious
weaknesses
and
improbabilities
yet
inspired
an
old
man
like
sir
nicholas
with
so
much
fortitude
at
first
too
a
kind
of
bulletin
was
always
issued
on
the
sunday
and
thursday
mornings
and
nailed
upon
the
outside
of
the
gatehouse
so
that
any
who
pleased
could
come
there
and
get
information
and
an
interpreter
stood
there
sometimes
one
of
the
educated
younger
sons
of
piers
and
read
out
to
the
groups
from
lady
maxwell
sprawling
old
handwriting
news
of
the
master
sir
nicholas
has
been
had
before
the
council
he
read
out
one
day
in
a
high
complacent
voice
to
the
awed
listeners
and
has
been
sent
to
the
tower
of
london
this
caused
consternation
in
the
village
as
it
was
supposed
by
the
not
without
excuse
that
the
tower
was
the
antechamber
of
death
but
confidence
was
restored
by
the
further
announcement
a
few
lines
down
that
he
was
well
and
cheerful
great
interest
too
was
aroused
by
more
domestic
matters
sir
nicholas
it
was
proclaimed
is
in
a
little
separate
chamber
of
his
own
jakes
his
gaoler
seems
an
honest
fellow
sir
nicholas
hath
a
little
mattress
from
a
friend
that
boyd
fetched
for
him
he
has
dinner
at
eleven
and
supper
at
five
sir
nicholas
hopes
that
all
are
well
in
the
village
but
other
changes
had
followed
the
old
knight
arrest
the
furious
indignation
in
the
village
against
the
part
that
the
rectory
had
played
in
the
matter
made
it
impossible
for
the
dents
to
remain
there
that
the
minister
wife
should
have
been
publicly
ducked
and
that
not
by
a
few
blackguards
but
by
the
solid
fathers
and
sons
with
the
applause
of
the
wives
and
daughters
made
her
husband
position
intolerable
and
further
evidence
was
forthcoming
in
the
behaviour
of
the
people
towards
the
rector
himself
some
boys
had
guffawed
during
his
sermon
on
the
following
sunday
when
he
had
ventured
on
a
word
or
two
of
penitence
as
to
his
share
in
the
matter
and
he
was
shouted
after
on
his
way
home
dent
seemed
strangely
changed
and
broken
during
her
stay
at
the
hall
she
had
received
a
terrible
shock
and
it
was
not
safe
to
move
her
back
to
her
own
house
for
the
first
two
or
three
nights
she
would
start
from
sleep
again
and
again
screaming
for
help
and
mercy
and
nothing
would
quiet
her
till
she
was
wide
awake
and
saw
in
the
the
curtained
windows
and
the
bolted
door
and
the
kindly
face
of
an
old
servant
or
mistress
margaret
with
her
beads
in
her
hand
isabel
who
came
up
to
see
her
two
or
three
times
was
both
startled
and
affected
by
the
change
in
her
and
by
the
extraordinary
mood
of
humility
which
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
hard
puritan
i
begged
pardon
she
whispered
to
the
girl
one
evening
sitting
up
in
bed
and
staring
at
her
with
wide
hard
eyes
i
begged
pardon
of
lady
maxwell
though
i
am
not
fit
to
speak
to
her
do
you
think
she
can
ever
forgive
me
do
you
think
she
can
it
was
i
you
know
who
wrought
all
the
mischief
as
i
have
wrought
all
the
mischief
in
the
village
all
these
years
she
said
she
did
and
she
kissed
me
and
said
that
our
saviour
had
forgiven
her
much
more
but
but
do
you
think
she
has
forgiven
me
and
then
again
another
night
a
day
or
two
before
they
left
the
place
she
spoke
to
isabel
again
look
after
the
poor
bodies
she
said
teach
them
a
little
charity
i
have
taught
them
nought
but
bitterness
and
malice
so
they
have
but
given
me
my
own
back
again
i
have
reaped
what
i
have
sown
so
the
dents
slipped
off
early
one
morning
before
the
folk
were
up
and
by
the
following
sunday
young
bodder
of
whom
the
bishop
entertained
a
high
opinion
occupied
the
little
desk
outside
the
chancel
arch
and
great
keynes
once
more
had
to
thank
god
and
the
diocesan
that
it
possessed
a
proper
minister
of
its
own
and
not
a
mere
unordained
reader
which
was
all
that
many
parishes
could
obtain
towards
the
end
of
september
further
hints
began
to
arrive
very
much
underlined
in
the
knight
letters
of
stewart
and
his
sufferings
you
remember
isabel
read
out
one
saturday
evening
mr
stewart
this
puzzled
the
old
ladies
sorely
till
isabel
explained
their
lord
artfulness
my
dearest
i
fear
the
worst
for
him
i
do
not
mean
apostacy
thank
god
but
i
fear
that
these
have
torn
him
sadly
in
their
then
followed
the
story
of
jakes
with
all
its
horror
all
the
greater
from
the
obscurity
of
the
details
isabel
put
the
paper
down
trembling
as
she
sat
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
in
the
parlour
upstairs
and
thought
of
the
man
with
his
steady
mouth
and
low
laugh
whom
anthony
had
described
to
her
lady
maxwell
posted
upon
the
gatehouse
sir
nicholas
fears
that
a
is
in
sore
trouble
he
hopes
he
may
not
then
after
a
few
days
more
a
brief
notice
with
a
drawn
round
it
that
ran
in
bodder
despite
our
has
passed
away
pray
for
his
soul
sir
nicholas
had
written
in
great
agitation
to
this
effect
my
sweetheart
i
have
heavy
news
there
was
a
great
company
of
folks
below
my
window
in
the
inner
ward
where
the
road
runs
up
below
the
bloody
tower
it
was
about
nine
of
the
clock
and
there
was
a
horse
there
whose
head
i
could
see
and
presently
from
the
beauchamp
tower
came
as
i
thought
an
old
man
between
two
warders
and
then
i
could
not
very
well
see
the
men
were
in
my
way
but
soon
the
horse
went
off
and
the
men
after
him
and
i
could
hear
the
groaning
of
the
crowd
that
were
waiting
for
them
outside
and
when
jakes
brought
me
my
dinner
at
eleven
of
the
clock
he
told
me
it
was
our
friend
think
of
it
my
dearest
him
whom
i
thought
an
old
man
that
had
been
taken
off
to
tyburn
and
now
i
need
say
no
more
but
bid
you
pray
for
his
soul
isabel
could
hardly
finish
reading
it
for
she
heard
a
quick
sobbing
breath
behind
her
and
felt
a
wrinkled
old
hand
caressing
her
hair
and
cheek
as
her
voice
faltered
meanwhile
hubert
was
in
town
sir
nicholas
had
at
first
intended
him
to
go
down
at
once
and
take
charge
of
the
estate
but
piers
was
very
competent
and
so
his
father
consented
that
he
should
remain
in
london
until
the
beginning
of
october
and
this
too
better
suited
plans
who
wished
to
send
isabel
off
about
the
same
time
to
northampton
when
hubert
at
last
did
arrive
he
soon
showed
himself
extremely
capable
and
apt
for
the
work
he
was
out
on
the
estate
from
morning
till
night
on
his
cob
and
there
was
not
a
man
under
him
from
piers
downwards
who
had
anything
but
praise
for
his
insight
and
industry
there
was
in
hubert
too
as
there
so
often
is
in
who
love
and
understand
the
life
of
the
woods
and
fields
a
balancing
quality
of
a
deep
vein
of
sentiment
and
this
was
now
consecrated
to
isabel
norris
he
had
pleasant
dreams
as
he
rode
home
in
the
autumn
evening
under
the
sweet
keen
sky
where
the
harvest
moon
rose
large
and
yellow
over
the
hills
to
his
left
and
shed
a
strange
mystical
light
that
blended
in
a
kind
of
chord
with
the
dying
daylight
it
was
at
times
like
that
when
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
dying
leaves
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
frost
in
it
and
the
cottages
one
by
one
opened
red
glowing
eyes
in
the
dusk
that
the
boy
began
to
dream
of
a
home
of
his
own
and
pleasant
domestic
joys
of
burning
logs
on
the
hearth
and
lighted
candles
and
a
dear
slender
figure
moving
about
the
room
he
used
to
rehearse
to
himself
little
meetings
and
partings
look
at
the
roofs
of
the
dower
house
against
the
primrose
sky
as
he
rode
up
the
fields
homewards
identify
her
window
dark
now
as
she
was
away
and
long
for
christmas
when
she
would
be
back
again
the
only
shadow
over
these
delightful
pictures
was
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
future
where
after
all
would
the
home
be
for
he
was
a
younger
son
he
thought
about
james
very
often
when
he
came
back
would
he
live
at
home
would
it
all
be
james
at
his
father
death
these
woods
and
fields
and
farms
and
stately
house
would
it
ever
come
to
him
and
meanwhile
where
should
he
and
isabel
live
when
the
religious
difficulty
had
been
surmounted
as
he
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
sooner
or
later
when
he
thought
of
his
father
now
it
was
with
a
continually
increasing
respect
he
had
been
inclined
to
despise
him
sometimes
before
as
one
of
a
simple
and
uneventful
life
but
now
the
red
shadow
of
the
law
conferred
dignity
to
have
been
imprisoned
in
the
tower
was
a
patent
of
nobility
adding
distinction
and
gravity
to
the
commonplace
something
of
the
glory
even
rested
on
hubert
himself
as
he
rode
and
hawked
with
other
catholic
boys
whose
fathers
maybe
were
equally
zealous
for
the
faith
but
less
distinguished
by
suffering
for
it
before
anthony
went
back
to
cambridge
he
and
hubert
went
out
nearly
every
day
together
with
or
without
their
hawks
anthony
was
about
three
years
the
younger
and
hubert
additional
responsibility
for
the
estate
made
the
younger
boy
more
in
awe
of
him
than
the
difference
in
their
ages
warranted
besides
hubert
knew
quite
as
much
about
sport
and
had
more
opportunities
for
indulging
his
taste
for
it
there
was
no
heronry
at
hand
besides
it
was
not
the
breeding
time
which
is
the
proper
season
for
this
particular
sport
so
they
did
not
trouble
to
ride
out
to
one
but
the
partridges
and
hares
and
rabbits
that
abounded
in
the
maxwell
estate
gave
them
plenty
of
quarreys
they
preferred
to
go
out
generally
without
the
falconer
a
dutchman
who
had
been
taken
into
the
service
of
sir
nicholas
thirty
years
before
when
things
had
been
more
prosperous
it
was
less
embarrassing
so
but
they
would
have
a
lad
to
carry
the
cadge
and
a
pony
following
them
to
carry
the
game
they
added
to
the
excitement
of
the
sport
by
making
it
a
competition
between
their
birds
and
flying
them
one
after
another
or
sometimes
at
the
same
quarry
as
in
coursing
but
this
often
led
to
the
birds
crabbing
anthony
peregrine
eliza
was
almost
unapproachable
and
the
lad
was
the
more
proud
of
her
as
he
had
made
her
himself
as
an
eyess
or
young
falcon
captured
as
a
nestling
but
on
the
other
hand
hubert
goshawk
margaret
a
fiery
little
creature
named
inappropriately
enough
after
his
tranquil
aunt
as
a
rule
did
better
than
anthony
isabel
and
brought
the
scores
level
again
there
was
one
superb
day
that
survived
long
in
anthony
memory
and
conversation
when
he
had
done
exceptionally
well
when
eliza
had
surpassed
herself
and
even
isabel
had
acquitted
herself
with
credit
it
was
one
of
those
glorious
days
of
wind
and
sun
that
occasionally
fall
in
early
october
with
a
pale
turquoise
sky
overhead
and
air
that
seems
to
sparkle
and
intoxicate
like
wine
they
went
out
together
after
dinner
about
noon
their
ponies
and
spaniels
danced
with
the
joy
of
life
lady
maxwell
cried
to
them
from
the
north
terrace
to
be
careful
and
pointed
out
to
norris
who
had
dined
with
them
what
a
graceful
seat
hubert
had
and
then
added
politely
but
as
an
obvious
afterthought
that
anthony
seemed
to
manage
his
pony
with
great
address
the
boys
turned
off
through
the
village
and
soon
got
on
to
high
ground
to
the
west
of
the
village
and
all
among
the
stubble
and
mustard
with
tracts
of
rich
sunlit
country
of
meadows
and
russet
woodland
below
them
on
every
side
then
the
sport
began
it
seemed
as
if
eliza
could
not
make
a
mistake
there
rose
a
solitary
partridge
forty
yards
away
with
a
whirl
of
wings
the
coveys
were
being
well
broken
up
by
now
anthony
unhooded
his
bird
and
cast
off
with
the
falconer
cry
ha
ha
ha
and
up
soared
eliza
with
the
tinkle
of
bells
on
great
strokes
of
those
mighty
wings
up
up
behind
the
partridge
that
fled
low
down
the
wind
for
his
life
the
two
ponies
were
put
to
the
gallop
as
the
peregrine
began
to
stoop
and
then
down
like
a
plummet
she
fell
with
closed
wings
raked
the
quarry
with
her
talons
as
she
passed
recovered
herself
and
as
anthony
came
up
holding
out
the
returned
to
him
and
was
hooded
and
leashed
again
and
sat
there
on
his
gloved
wrist
with
wet
claws
just
shivering
slightly
from
her
nerves
like
the
aristocrat
she
was
while
her
master
stroked
her
ashy
back
and
the
boy
picked
up
the
quarry
admiring
the
deep
rent
before
he
threw
it
into
the
pannier
then
hubert
had
the
next
turn
but
his
falcon
missed
his
first
stoop
and
did
not
strike
the
quarry
till
the
second
attempt
thus
scoring
one
to
anthony
account
then
the
peregrines
were
put
back
on
the
cadge
as
the
boys
got
near
to
a
wide
meadow
in
a
hollow
where
the
rabbits
used
to
feed
and
the
goshawks
margaret
and
isabel
were
taken
each
in
turn
sitting
unhooded
on
her
master
wrist
while
they
all
watched
the
long
thin
grass
for
the
quick
movement
that
marked
the
passage
of
a
rabbit
and
then
in
a
moment
the
bird
was
cast
off
the
goshawk
would
rise
just
high
enough
to
see
the
quarry
in
the
grass
then
fly
straight
with
arched
wings
and
pounces
stretched
out
as
she
came
over
the
quarry
then
striking
him
between
the
shoulders
would
close
with
him
and
her
master
would
come
up
and
take
her
off
throw
the
rabbit
to
the
and
the
other
would
have
the
next
attempt
and
so
they
went
on
for
three
or
four
hours
encouraging
their
birds
whooping
the
death
of
the
quarry
watching
with
all
the
keenness
the
soaring
and
stooping
of
the
peregrines
the
raking
off
of
the
goshawks
listening
to
the
thrilling
tinkle
of
the
bells
and
taking
back
their
birds
to
sit
triumphant
and
complacent
on
their
wrists
when
the
quarry
had
been
fairly
struck
and
furious
and
sullen
when
it
had
eluded
them
two
or
three
times
till
their
breath
left
them
in
the
dizzy
rushes
and
they
canceliered
or
even
returned
disheartened
and
would
fly
no
more
till
they
had
forgotten
till
at
last
the
shadows
grew
long
and
the
game
more
wary
and
the
hawks
and
ponies
tired
and
the
boys
put
up
the
birds
on
the
cadge
and
leashed
them
to
it
securely
and
jogged
slowly
homewards
together
up
the
valley
road
that
led
to
the
village
talking
in
technical
terms
of
how
the
merlin
feather
must
be
imped
and
of
the
relative
merits
of
the
varvels
or
little
silver
rings
at
the
end
of
the
jesses
through
which
the
leash
ran
and
the
dutch
swivel
that
squire
blackett
always
used
as
they
got
nearer
home
and
the
red
roofs
of
the
dower
house
began
to
glow
in
the
ruddy
sunlight
above
the
meadows
hubert
began
to
shift
the
conversation
round
to
isabel
and
inquire
when
she
was
coming
home
anthony
was
rather
bored
at
this
turn
of
the
talk
but
thought
she
would
be
back
by
christmas
at
the
latest
and
said
that
she
was
at
northampton
and
had
hubert
ever
seen
such
courage
as
eliza
but
hubert
would
not
be
put
off
but
led
the
talk
back
again
to
the
girl
and
at
last
told
anthony
under
promise
of
secrecy
that
he
was
fond
of
isabel
and
wished
to
make
her
his
wife
and
oh
did
anthony
think
she
cared
really
for
him
anthony
stared
and
wondered
and
had
no
opinion
at
all
on
the
subject
but
presently
fell
in
love
with
the
idea
that
hubert
should
be
his
and
go
hawking
with
him
every
day
and
he
added
a
private
romance
of
his
own
in
which
he
and
mary
corbet
should
be
at
the
dower
house
with
hubert
and
isabel
at
the
hall
while
the
elders
his
own
father
sir
nicholas
james
lady
maxwell
and
mistress
torridon
had
all
taken
up
submissive
and
complacent
attitudes
in
the
middle
distance
he
was
so
pensive
that
evening
that
his
father
asked
him
at
supper
whether
he
had
not
had
a
good
day
which
diverted
his
thoughts
from
mistress
corbet
and
led
him
away
from
sentiment
on
a
stream
of
his
own
talk
with
long
backwaters
of
description
of
this
and
that
stoop
and
of
exactly
the
points
in
which
he
thought
the
maxwells
falconer
had
failed
in
the
training
of
hubert
jane
hubert
found
a
long
letter
waiting
from
his
father
which
lady
maxwell
gave
him
to
read
with
messages
to
himself
in
it
about
the
estate
which
brought
him
down
again
from
the
treading
of
rosy
with
a
phantom
isabel
whither
his
hawks
and
the
shouting
wind
and
the
happy
day
had
wafted
him
down
to
questions
of
barns
and
and
the
sober
realities
of
harvest
chapter
xi
master
calvin
isabel
reached
northampton
a
day
or
two
before
hubert
came
back
to
great
keynes
she
travelled
down
with
two
combined
parties
going
to
leicester
and
nottingham
sleeping
at
leighton
buzzard
on
the
way
and
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
reached
the
house
of
her
father
friend
carrington
that
stood
in
the
market
square
her
father
intention
in
sending
her
to
this
particular
town
and
household
was
to
show
her
how
puritanism
when
carried
to
its
extreme
was
as
orderly
and
disciplined
a
system
and
was
able
to
control
the
lives
of
its
adherents
as
well
as
the
catholicism
whose
influence
on
her
character
he
found
himself
beginning
to
fear
but
he
wished
also
that
she
should
be
repelled
to
some
extent
by
the
merciless
rigidity
she
would
find
at
northampton
and
thus
after
an
oscillation
or
two
come
to
rest
in
the
quiet
eclecticism
of
that
middle
position
which
he
occupied
himself
the
town
indeed
was
at
this
time
a
miniature
geneva
there
was
something
in
the
temper
of
its
inhabitants
that
made
it
especially
susceptible
to
the
wave
of
puritanism
that
was
sweeping
over
england
lollardy
had
flourished
among
them
so
far
back
as
the
reign
of
richard
ii
when
the
mayor
as
folks
told
one
another
with
pride
had
plucked
a
by
the
vestment
on
the
way
to
the
altar
in
all
saints
church
and
had
made
him
give
over
his
mummery
till
the
preacher
had
finished
his
sermon
carrington
too
a
man
churchwarden
of
saint
sepulchre
was
a
representative
of
the
straitest
views
and
desperately
in
earnest
for
him
the
world
ranged
itself
into
the
redeemed
and
the
damned
these
two
companies
were
the
pivots
of
life
for
him
and
every
subject
of
mind
or
desire
was
significant
only
so
far
as
it
bore
relations
to
be
immutable
decrees
of
god
but
his
fierce
and
merciless
theological
insistence
was
disguised
by
a
real
human
tenderness
and
a
marked
courtesy
of
manner
and
isabel
found
him
a
kindly
and
thoughtful
host
yet
the
mechanical
strictness
of
the
household
and
the
overpowering
sense
of
the
weightiness
of
life
that
it
conveyed
was
a
revelation
to
isabel
carrington
at
family
prayers
was
a
tremendous
figure
as
he
kneeled
upright
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
the
sombre
and
it
seemed
to
isabel
in
her
place
that
the
pitiless
presence
that
kept
such
terrifying
silence
as
the
doctor
cried
on
jehovah
was
almost
a
different
god
to
that
whom
she
knew
in
the
morning
parlour
at
home
to
whom
her
father
prayed
with
more
familiarity
but
no
less
romance
and
who
answered
in
the
sunshine
that
lay
on
the
carpet
and
the
shadows
of
boughs
that
moved
across
it
and
the
chirp
of
the
birds
under
the
eaves
and
all
day
long
she
thought
she
noticed
the
same
difference
at
great
keynes
life
was
made
up
of
many
parts
the
love
of
family
the
country
doings
the
worship
of
god
the
garden
and
the
company
of
the
hall
ladies
and
the
presence
of
god
interpenetrated
all
like
light
or
fragrance
but
here
life
was
lived
under
the
glare
of
his
eye
and
absorption
in
any
detail
apart
from
the
consciousness
of
that
encompassing
presence
had
the
nature
of
sin
on
the
saturday
after
her
arrival
as
she
was
walking
by
the
nen
with
kate
carrington
one
of
the
two
girls
she
asked
her
about
the
crowd
of
ministers
she
had
seen
in
the
streets
that
morning
they
have
been
to
the
prophesyings
said
kate
my
father
says
that
there
is
no
exercise
that
sanctifies
a
godly
young
minister
so
quickly
kate
went
on
to
describe
them
further
the
ministers
assembled
each
saturday
at
nine
and
one
of
their
number
gave
a
short
or
lecture
then
all
present
were
invited
to
join
in
the
discussion
the
less
instructed
would
ask
questions
the
more
experienced
would
answer
and
debate
would
run
high
such
a
method
kate
explained
who
herself
was
a
zealous
and
well
instructed
calvinist
was
the
surest
and
swiftest
road
to
truth
for
every
one
held
the
open
scriptures
in
his
hand
and
interpreted
and
checked
the
speakers
by
the
aid
of
that
infallible
guide
but
if
a
man
judgment
lead
him
wrong
asked
isabel
who
professedly
admitted
authority
to
have
some
place
in
matters
of
faith
all
must
hold
the
apostles
creed
first
of
all
said
kate
and
must
set
his
name
to
a
paper
declaring
the
pope
to
be
antichrist
with
other
truths
upon
it
isabel
was
puzzled
for
it
seemed
now
as
if
private
judgment
were
not
supreme
among
its
professors
but
she
did
not
care
to
question
further
it
began
to
dawn
upon
her
presently
however
why
the
queen
was
so
fierce
against
prophesyings
for
she
saw
that
they
exercised
that
spirit
of
exclusiveness
the
property
of
papist
and
puritan
alike
which
since
it
was
the
antithesis
of
the
tolerant
comprehensiveness
of
the
church
of
england
was
also
the
enemy
of
the
theological
peace
that
elizabeth
was
seeking
to
impose
upon
the
country
and
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
papist
and
puritan
sundered
so
far
in
theology
were
united
in
suffering
for
conscience
sake
on
the
sunday
morning
isabel
went
with
carrington
and
the
two
girls
to
the
round
templars
church
of
saint
sepulchre
for
the
morning
prayer
at
eight
and
then
on
to
peter
for
the
sermon
it
was
the
latter
function
that
was
important
in
puritan
eyes
for
the
word
preached
was
considered
to
have
an
almost
sacramental
force
in
the
application
of
truth
and
grace
to
the
soul
and
crowds
of
people
with
downcast
eyes
and
in
sombre
dress
were
pouring
down
the
narrow
streets
from
all
the
churches
round
while
the
great
bell
beat
out
its
summons
from
the
norman
tower
the
church
was
filled
from
end
to
end
as
they
came
in
meeting
carrington
at
the
door
and
they
all
passed
up
together
to
the
pew
reserved
for
the
churchwarden
close
beneath
the
pulpit
as
isabel
looked
round
her
it
came
upon
her
very
forcibly
what
she
had
begun
to
notice
even
at
great
keynes
that
the
religion
preached
there
did
not
fit
the
church
in
which
it
was
set
forth
and
that
though
great
efforts
had
been
made
to
conform
the
building
to
the
worship
there
had
been
no
half
measures
at
northampton
for
the
puritans
had
a
loathing
of
what
they
called
a
altars
footpaces
and
piscin√¶
had
been
swept
away
and
all
marks
of
them
removed
as
well
as
the
and
every
image
in
the
building
the
stained
windows
had
been
replaced
by
plain
glass
painted
white
the
walls
had
been
whitewashed
from
roof
to
floor
and
every
suspicion
of
colour
erased
except
where
texts
of
scripture
ran
rigidly
across
the
open
wall
spaces
we
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
grace
isabel
read
opposite
her
beneath
the
clerestory
windows
and
above
all
the
point
to
which
all
lines
and
eyes
converged
was
occupied
no
longer
by
the
table
but
by
the
tribunal
of
the
lord
yet
underneath
the
disguise
the
old
religion
triumphed
still
beneath
the
great
plain
orderly
scheme
without
depth
of
shadows
dominated
by
the
towering
place
of
proclamation
where
the
herald
waited
to
begin
the
round
arches
and
the
elaborate
mouldings
and
the
cool
depths
beyond
the
pillars
all
declared
that
in
the
god
for
whom
that
temple
was
built
there
was
mystery
as
well
as
revelation
love
as
well
as
justice
condescension
as
well
as
majesty
beauty
as
well
as
awfulness
invitations
as
well
as
eternal
decrees
isabel
looked
up
presently
as
the
people
still
streamed
in
and
watched
the
minister
in
his
rustling
genevan
gown
leaning
with
his
elbows
on
the
bible
that
rested
open
on
the
great
tasselled
velvet
cushion
before
him
everything
about
him
was
on
the
grand
scale
his
great
hands
were
clasped
and
protruded
over
the
edge
of
the
book
and
his
heavy
dark
face
looked
menacingly
round
on
the
crowded
church
he
had
the
air
of
a
melancholy
giant
about
to
engage
in
some
tragic
pleasure
but
isabel
instinctive
dislike
began
to
pass
into
positive
terror
so
soon
as
he
began
to
preach
when
the
last
comers
had
found
a
place
and
the
talking
had
stopped
he
presently
gave
out
his
text
in
a
slow
thunderous
voice
that
silenced
the
last
whispers
what
shall
we
then
say
to
these
things
if
god
be
on
our
side
who
can
be
against
us
there
were
a
few
slow
sentences
in
a
deep
resonant
voice
uttering
each
syllable
deliberately
like
the
explosion
of
a
gun
and
in
a
minute
or
two
he
was
in
the
thick
of
calvin
smoky
gospel
doctrine
voice
and
man
were
alike
terrible
and
overpowering
there
lay
the
great
scheme
in
a
few
minutes
seen
by
isabel
as
though
through
the
door
of
hell
illumined
by
the
glare
of
the
eternal
embers
the
huge
merciless
will
of
god
stood
there
before
her
disclosed
in
all
its
awfulness
armed
with
thunders
moving
on
mighty
wheels
the
foreknowledge
of
god
closed
the
question
henceforth
and
if
proof
were
needed
made
predestination
plain
there
was
man
destiny
irrevocably
fixed
changeless
and
immovable
as
the
laws
of
god
own
being
yet
over
the
rigid
and
awful
face
of
god
flickered
a
faint
light
named
mercy
and
this
mercy
vindicated
its
existence
by
demanding
that
some
souls
should
escape
the
final
and
endless
doom
that
was
the
due
reward
of
every
soul
conceived
and
born
in
enmity
against
god
and
under
the
frown
of
his
justice
then
heralded
too
by
wrath
the
figure
of
jesus
began
to
glimmer
through
the
thunderclouds
and
isabel
lifted
her
eyes
to
look
in
hope
but
he
was
not
as
she
had
known
him
in
his
graciousness
and
as
he
had
revealed
himself
to
her
in
tender
communion
and
among
the
flowers
and
under
the
clear
skies
of
sussex
here
in
this
echoing
world
of
wrath
he
stood
pale
and
rigid
with
lightning
in
his
eyes
and
the
grim
and
crimson
cross
behind
him
and
as
powerless
as
his
own
father
himself
to
save
one
poor
timid
despairing
hoping
soul
against
whom
the
eternal
decree
had
gone
forth
jesus
was
stern
and
forbidding
here
with
the
red
glare
of
wrath
on
his
face
too
instead
of
the
rosy
crown
of
love
upon
his
forehead
his
mouth
was
closed
with
compressed
lips
which
surely
would
only
open
to
condemn
not
that
mouth
quivering
and
human
that
had
smiled
and
trembled
and
bent
down
from
the
cross
to
kiss
poor
souls
that
could
not
hope
nor
help
themselves
that
had
smiled
upon
isabel
ever
since
she
had
known
him
it
was
appalling
to
this
gentle
maiden
soul
that
had
bloomed
and
rejoiced
so
long
in
the
shadow
of
his
healing
to
be
torn
out
of
her
retreat
and
set
thus
under
the
consuming
noonday
of
the
justice
of
this
sun
of
righteousness
for
as
she
listened
it
was
all
so
miserably
convincing
her
own
little
essays
of
intellect
and
flights
of
hopeful
imagination
were
caught
up
and
whirled
away
in
the
strong
rush
of
this
man
argument
her
timid
expectancy
that
god
was
really
love
as
she
understood
the
word
in
the
vision
of
her
saviour
person
this
was
dashed
aside
as
a
childish
fancy
the
vision
of
the
father
of
the
everlasting
arms
receded
into
the
realm
of
dreams
and
instead
there
lowered
overhead
in
this
furious
tempest
of
wrath
a
monstrous
god
with
a
stony
face
and
a
stonier
heart
who
was
eternally
either
her
torment
or
salvation
and
isabel
thought
and
trembled
at
the
blasphemy
that
if
god
were
such
as
this
the
one
would
be
no
less
agony
than
the
other
was
this
man
bearing
false
witness
not
only
against
his
neighbour
but
far
more
awfully
against
his
god
but
it
was
too
convincing
it
was
built
up
on
an
iron
hammered
framework
of
a
great
man
intellect
and
made
white
hot
with
another
great
man
burning
eloquence
but
it
seemed
to
isabel
now
and
again
as
if
a
virile
devil
were
proclaiming
the
gospel
of
everlasting
shame
there
he
bent
over
the
pulpit
with
flaming
face
and
great
compelling
gestures
that
swayed
the
congregation
eliciting
the
emotions
he
desired
as
the
conductor
baton
draws
out
the
music
for
the
man
was
a
great
orator
and
he
stormed
and
roared
and
seemed
to
marshal
the
very
powers
of
the
world
to
come
compelling
them
by
his
nod
and
interpreting
them
by
his
voice
and
below
him
sat
this
poor
child
tossed
along
on
his
eloquence
like
a
straw
on
a
flood
and
yet
hating
and
resenting
it
and
struggling
to
detach
herself
and
disbelieve
every
word
he
spoke
as
the
last
sands
were
running
out
in
his
he
came
to
harbour
from
this
raging
sea
and
in
a
few
deep
resonant
sentences
like
those
with
which
he
began
he
pictured
the
peace
of
the
ransomed
soul
that
knows
itself
safe
in
the
arms
of
god
that
rejoices
even
in
this
world
in
the
light
of
his
face
and
the
ecstasy
of
his
embrace
that
dwells
by
waters
of
comfort
and
lies
down
in
the
green
pastures
of
the
heavenly
love
while
round
this
little
island
of
salvation
in
an
ocean
of
terror
the
thunders
of
wrath
sound
only
as
the
noise
of
surge
on
a
reef
the
effect
on
isabel
was
very
great
it
was
far
more
startling
than
her
visit
to
london
there
her
quiet
religion
had
received
high
sanction
in
the
mystery
of
paul
but
here
it
was
the
plainest
calvinism
preached
with
immense
power
the
preacher
last
words
of
peace
were
no
peace
to
her
if
it
was
necessary
to
pass
those
bellowing
breakers
of
wrath
to
reach
the
happy
country
then
she
had
never
reached
it
yet
she
had
lived
so
far
in
an
illusion
her
life
had
been
spent
in
a
fool
paradise
where
the
light
and
warmth
and
flowers
were
but
artificial
after
all
and
she
knew
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
set
out
again
though
she
recognised
dimly
the
compelling
power
of
this
religion
and
that
it
was
one
which
if
sincerely
embraced
would
make
the
smallest
details
of
life
momentous
with
eternal
weight
yet
she
knew
that
her
soul
could
never
respond
to
it
and
whether
saved
or
damned
that
it
could
only
cower
in
miserable
despair
under
a
deity
that
was
so
sovereign
as
this
so
her
heart
was
low
and
her
eyes
sad
as
she
followed
carrington
out
of
church
was
this
then
really
the
revelation
of
the
love
of
god
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
had
all
that
she
knew
as
the
gospel
melted
down
into
this
fiery
lump
the
rest
of
the
day
did
not
alter
the
impression
made
on
her
mind
there
was
little
talk
or
evidence
of
any
human
fellowship
in
the
carrington
household
on
the
lord
day
there
was
a
word
or
two
of
grave
commendation
on
the
sermon
during
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
there
was
the
evening
prayer
to
be
attended
in
sepulchre
followed
by
an
exposition
and
a
public
catechising
on
calvin
questions
and
answers
here
the
same
awful
doctrines
reappeared
condensed
with
an
icy
reality
even
more
paralysing
than
the
burning
presentation
of
them
in
the
morning
sermon
she
was
spared
questions
herself
as
she
was
a
stranger
and
sat
to
hear
girls
of
her
own
age
and
older
men
and
women
who
looked
as
as
herself
utter
definitions
of
the
method
of
salvation
and
the
being
and
character
of
god
that
compelled
the
assent
of
her
intellect
while
they
jarred
with
her
spiritual
experience
as
fiercely
as
brazen
trumpets
out
of
tune
in
the
evening
there
followed
further
religious
exercises
in
the
dark
at
the
close
of
which
carrington
read
one
of
calvin
genevan
discourses
from
his
tall
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
she
looked
at
him
at
first
and
wondered
in
her
heart
whether
that
man
with
his
clear
gentle
voice
and
his
pleasant
old
face
crowned
with
hair
seen
in
the
mellow
candlelight
really
believed
in
the
terrible
gospel
of
the
morning
for
she
heard
nothing
of
the
academic
discourse
that
he
was
reading
now
and
presently
her
eyes
wandered
away
out
of
the
windows
to
the
pale
night
sky
there
still
glimmered
a
faint
streak
of
light
in
the
west
across
the
market
square
it
seemed
to
her
as
a
kind
of
mirror
of
her
soul
at
this
moment
the
tender
daylight
had
faded
though
she
could
still
discern
the
token
of
its
presence
far
away
and
as
from
behind
the
bars
of
a
cage
but
the
night
of
god
wrath
was
fast
blotting
out
the
last
touch
of
radiance
from
her
despairing
soul
carrington
looked
at
her
with
courteous
anxiety
but
with
approval
too
as
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
as
she
said
to
him
there
were
shadows
of
weariness
and
depression
under
her
eyes
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
a
little
and
the
doctor
heart
stirred
with
hope
that
the
word
of
god
had
reached
at
last
this
lamb
of
his
who
had
been
fed
too
long
on
milk
and
sheltered
from
the
sun
but
who
was
now
coming
out
driven
it
might
be
and
unhappy
but
still
on
its
way
to
the
plain
and
wholesome
pastures
of
the
word
that
lay
in
the
glow
of
the
unveiled
glory
of
god
isabel
in
her
dark
room
upstairs
was
miserable
she
stood
long
at
her
window
her
face
pressed
against
the
glass
and
looked
at
the
sky
from
which
the
last
streak
of
light
had
now
died
and
longed
with
all
her
might
for
her
own
oak
room
at
home
with
her
and
the
familiar
things
about
her
and
the
pines
rustling
outside
in
the
sweet
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
an
irresistible
hand
had
plucked
her
out
from
those
loved
things
and
places
and
that
a
penetrating
eye
were
examining
every
corner
of
her
soul
in
one
sense
she
believed
herself
nearer
to
god
than
ever
before
but
it
was
heartbreaking
to
find
him
like
this
she
went
to
sleep
with
the
same
sense
of
a
burdening
presence
resting
on
her
spirit
the
next
morning
carrington
saw
her
privately
and
explained
to
her
a
notice
that
she
had
not
understood
when
it
had
been
given
out
in
church
the
day
before
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
quarterly
communion
would
be
administered
on
the
following
sunday
having
been
transferred
that
year
from
the
sunday
after
michaelmas
day
and
that
she
must
hold
herself
in
readiness
on
the
wednesday
afternoon
to
undergo
the
examination
that
was
enforced
in
every
household
in
northampton
at
the
hands
of
the
minister
and
churchwardens
but
you
need
not
fear
it
mistress
norris
he
said
kindly
seeing
her
alarm
my
daughter
kate
will
tell
you
all
that
is
needful
kate
too
told
her
it
would
be
little
more
than
formal
in
her
case
the
minister
will
not
ask
you
much
she
said
for
you
are
a
stranger
and
my
father
will
vouch
for
you
he
will
ask
you
of
irresistible
grace
and
of
the
sacrament
and
she
gave
her
a
couple
of
books
from
which
she
might
summarise
the
answers
especially
directing
her
attention
to
calvin
catechism
telling
her
that
that
was
the
book
with
which
all
the
servants
and
apprentices
were
obliged
to
be
familiar
when
wednesday
afternoon
came
one
by
one
the
members
of
the
household
went
before
the
inquisition
that
held
its
court
in
the
and
last
of
all
isabel
turn
came
the
three
gentlemen
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
long
side
of
the
table
with
their
backs
to
the
light
half
rose
and
bowed
to
her
as
she
entered
and
requested
her
to
sit
opposite
to
them
to
her
relief
it
was
the
minister
of
sepulchre
who
was
to
examine
her
he
who
had
read
the
service
and
discoursed
on
the
catechism
not
the
morning
preacher
he
was
a
man
who
seemed
a
little
ill
at
ease
himself
he
had
none
of
the
superb
confidence
of
the
preacher
but
appeared
to
be
one
to
whose
natural
character
this
stern
was
not
altogether
congenial
he
asked
a
few
very
simple
questions
as
to
when
she
had
last
taken
the
sacrament
how
she
would
interpret
the
words
this
is
my
body
and
looked
almost
grateful
when
she
answered
quietly
and
without
heat
he
asked
her
too
three
or
four
of
the
simpler
questions
which
kate
had
indicated
to
her
all
of
which
she
answered
satisfactorily
and
then
desired
to
know
whether
she
was
in
charity
with
all
men
and
whether
she
looked
to
jesus
christ
alone
as
her
one
saviour
finally
he
turned
to
carrington
and
wished
to
know
whether
mistress
norris
would
come
to
the
sacrament
at
five
or
nine
and
carrington
answered
that
she
would
no
doubt
wish
to
come
with
his
own
wife
and
daughters
at
nine
which
was
the
hour
for
the
folks
who
were
better
to
do
and
so
the
inquisition
ended
much
to
isabel
relief
but
this
was
a
very
extraordinary
experience
to
her
it
gave
her
a
first
glimpse
into
the
rigid
discipline
that
the
extreme
puritans
wished
to
see
enforced
everywhere
and
with
it
a
sense
of
corporate
responsibility
that
she
had
not
appreciated
before
the
congregation
meant
something
to
her
now
she
was
no
longer
alone
with
her
lord
individually
but
understood
that
she
was
part
of
a
body
with
various
functions
and
that
the
care
of
her
soul
was
not
merely
a
personal
matter
for
herself
but
involved
her
minister
and
the
officers
of
the
church
as
well
it
astonished
her
to
think
that
this
process
was
carried
out
on
every
individual
who
lived
in
the
town
in
preparation
for
the
sacrament
on
the
following
sunday
isabel
and
indeed
the
whole
household
spent
the
friday
and
saturday
in
rigid
and
severe
preparation
no
flesh
food
was
eaten
on
either
of
the
days
and
all
the
members
of
the
family
were
supposed
to
spend
several
hours
in
their
own
rooms
in
prayer
and
meditation
she
did
not
find
this
difficult
as
she
was
well
practised
in
solitude
and
prayer
and
she
scarcely
left
her
room
all
saturday
except
for
meals
o
lord
isabel
repeated
each
morning
and
evening
at
her
bedside
during
this
week
the
blind
dulness
of
our
corrupt
nature
will
not
suffer
us
sufficiently
to
weigh
these
thy
most
ample
benefits
yet
nevertheless
at
the
commandment
of
jesus
christ
our
lord
we
present
ourselves
to
this
his
table
which
he
hath
left
to
be
used
in
remembrance
of
his
death
until
his
coming
again
to
declare
and
witness
before
the
world
that
by
him
alone
we
have
received
liberty
and
life
that
by
him
alone
dost
thou
acknowledge
us
to
be
thy
children
and
heirs
that
by
him
alone
we
have
entrance
to
the
throne
of
thy
grace
that
by
him
alone
we
are
possessed
in
our
spiritual
kingdom
to
eat
and
drink
at
his
table
with
whom
we
have
our
conversation
presently
in
heaven
and
by
whom
our
bodies
shall
be
raised
up
again
from
the
dust
and
shall
be
placed
with
him
in
that
endless
joy
which
thou
o
father
of
mercy
hast
prepared
for
thine
elect
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
was
laid
and
so
she
prepared
herself
for
that
tryst
with
her
beloved
in
a
foreign
land
where
all
was
strange
and
unfamiliar
about
her
yet
he
was
hourly
drawing
nearer
and
she
cried
to
him
day
by
day
in
these
words
so
redolent
to
her
with
associations
of
past
communions
and
of
moments
of
great
spiritual
elevation
the
very
use
of
the
prayer
this
week
was
like
a
breeze
of
flowers
to
one
in
a
wilderness
on
the
saturday
night
she
ceremoniously
washed
her
feet
as
her
father
had
taught
her
and
lay
down
happier
than
she
had
been
for
days
past
for
would
bring
the
lover
of
her
soul
on
the
sunday
all
the
household
was
astir
early
at
their
prayers
and
about
eight
all
including
the
servants
who
had
just
returned
from
the
five
service
assembled
in
the
the
noise
of
the
feet
of
those
returning
from
church
had
ceased
on
the
pavement
of
the
square
outside
and
all
was
quiet
except
for
the
solemn
sound
of
the
bells
as
carrington
offered
extempore
prayer
for
all
who
were
fulfilling
the
lord
ordinance
on
that
day
and
isabel
once
more
felt
her
heart
yearn
to
a
god
who
seemed
love
after
all
sepulchre
was
nearly
full
when
they
arrived
the
mahogany
table
had
been
brought
down
from
the
eastern
wall
to
beneath
the
cupola
and
stood
there
with
a
large
white
cloth
descending
almost
to
the
ground
on
every
side
and
a
row
of
silver
vessels
flat
plates
and
tall
new
communion
cups
and
flagons
shone
upon
it
isabel
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
tried
to
withdraw
into
the
solitude
of
her
own
soul
but
the
noise
of
the
feet
coming
and
going
and
the
talking
on
all
sides
of
her
were
terribly
distracting
presently
four
ministers
entered
and
isabel
was
startled
to
see
as
she
raised
her
face
at
the
sudden
silence
that
none
of
them
wore
the
prescribed
surplice
for
she
had
not
been
accustomed
to
the
views
of
the
extreme
puritans
to
whom
this
was
a
remnant
of
popery
an
indifferent
thing
indeed
in
itself
as
they
so
often
maintained
but
far
from
indifferent
when
it
was
imposed
by
authority
one
entered
the
pulpit
the
other
three
took
their
places
at
the
holy
table
and
after
a
metrical
psalm
sung
in
the
genevan
fashion
the
service
began
at
the
proper
place
the
minister
in
the
pulpit
delivered
an
hour
sermon
of
the
type
to
which
isabel
was
being
now
introduced
for
the
first
time
but
bearing
again
and
again
on
the
point
that
the
sacrament
was
a
confession
to
the
world
of
faith
in
christ
it
was
in
no
sense
a
sacrificial
act
towards
god
as
the
papists
vainly
taught
this
part
of
the
sermon
was
spoiled
to
isabel
ears
at
least
by
a
flood
of
disagreeable
words
poured
out
against
the
popish
doctrine
and
the
end
of
the
sermon
consisted
of
a
searching
exhortation
to
those
who
contemplated
sin
who
bore
malice
who
were
in
any
way
holding
aloof
from
god
to
cast
themselves
mightily
upon
the
love
of
the
redeemer
bewailing
their
sinful
lives
and
purposing
to
amend
them
this
act
wrought
out
in
the
silence
of
the
soul
even
now
would
transfer
the
sinner
from
death
unto
life
and
turn
what
threatened
to
be
poison
into
a
lively
and
healthful
food
then
he
turned
to
those
who
came
prepared
and
repentant
hungering
and
thirsting
after
the
bread
of
life
and
the
wine
that
the
lord
had
mingled
and
congratulated
them
on
their
possession
of
grace
and
on
the
rich
access
of
sanctification
that
would
be
theirs
by
a
faithful
reception
of
this
comfortable
sacrament
and
then
in
half
a
dozen
concluding
sentences
he
preached
christ
as
food
to
the
hungry
a
stream
to
the
thirsty
a
rest
for
the
weary
it
is
he
alone
our
dear
redeemer
who
openeth
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
which
may
he
vouchsafe
to
bring
us
for
his
name
sake
isabel
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
preacher
did
not
descend
from
the
pulpit
after
the
sermon
but
that
as
soon
as
he
had
announced
that
the
mayor
would
sit
at
the
town
hall
with
the
ministers
and
churchwardens
on
the
following
thursday
to
inquire
into
the
cases
of
all
who
had
not
presented
themselves
for
communion
he
turned
and
began
to
busy
himself
with
the
great
bible
that
lay
on
the
cushion
the
service
went
on
and
the
conducting
of
it
was
shared
among
the
three
ministers
standing
one
at
the
centre
of
the
table
which
was
placed
endways
and
the
others
at
the
two
ends
as
the
prayer
of
consecration
was
begun
isabel
hid
her
face
as
she
was
accustomed
to
do
for
she
believed
it
to
be
the
principal
part
of
the
service
and
waited
for
the
silence
that
in
her
experience
generally
followed
the
amen
but
a
voice
immediately
began
from
the
pulpit
and
she
looked
up
startled
and
distracted
then
jesus
said
unto
them
pealed
out
the
preacher
voice
all
ye
shall
be
offended
by
me
this
night
for
it
is
written
i
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered
but
after
i
am
risen
i
will
go
into
galilee
before
you
ah
why
would
not
the
man
stop
isabel
did
not
want
the
past
saviour
but
the
present
now
not
a
dead
record
but
a
living
experience
above
all
not
the
minister
but
the
great
high
priest
himself
he
began
to
be
troubled
and
in
great
heaviness
and
said
unto
them
my
soul
is
very
heavy
even
unto
the
death
tarry
here
and
watch
the
three
ministers
had
communicated
by
now
and
there
was
a
rustle
and
clatter
of
feet
as
the
empty
seats
in
front
hung
with
houselling
cloths
began
to
be
filled
the
murmur
of
the
three
voices
below
as
the
ministers
passed
along
with
the
vessels
were
drowned
by
the
tale
of
the
passion
that
rang
out
overhead
couldest
thou
not
watch
one
hour
watch
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
the
spirit
indeed
is
ready
but
the
flesh
is
weak
it
was
coming
near
to
isabel
turn
the
carringtons
already
were
beginning
to
move
and
in
a
moment
or
two
she
rose
and
followed
them
out
the
people
were
pressing
up
the
aisles
and
as
she
stood
waiting
her
turn
to
pass
into
the
seat
she
could
not
help
noticing
the
disorder
that
prevailed
some
knelt
devoutly
some
stood
some
sat
to
receive
the
sacred
elements
and
all
the
while
louder
and
louder
above
the
rustling
and
the
loud
whispering
of
the
ministers
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
the
tale
rose
and
fell
on
the
cadences
of
the
preacher
voice
now
it
was
her
turn
she
was
kneeling
with
palms
outstretched
and
closed
eyes
ah
would
he
not
be
silent
for
one
moment
could
not
the
reality
speak
for
itself
and
its
interpreter
be
still
surely
the
king
of
love
needed
no
herald
when
himself
was
here
and
anon
in
the
dawning
the
high
priests
held
a
council
with
elders
and
the
scribes
and
the
whole
council
and
bound
jesus
and
led
him
away
and
so
it
was
over
presently
and
she
was
back
again
in
her
seat
distracted
and
miserable
trying
to
pray
forcing
herself
to
attend
now
to
the
reader
now
to
her
saviour
with
whom
she
believed
herself
in
intimate
union
and
finding
nothing
but
dryness
and
distraction
everywhere
how
interminable
it
was
she
opened
her
eyes
and
what
she
saw
amazed
and
absorbed
her
for
a
few
moments
some
were
sitting
back
and
talking
some
looking
cheerfully
about
them
as
if
at
a
public
entertainment
one
man
especially
overwhelmed
her
imagination
with
a
great
red
face
and
neck
like
a
butcher
animal
and
brutal
with
a
heavy
hanging
jowl
and
little
narrow
eyes
how
bored
and
depressed
he
was
by
this
long
obligatory
ceremony
then
once
more
she
closed
her
eyes
in
at
her
distractions
here
were
her
lips
still
fragrant
with
the
wine
of
god
the
pressure
of
her
beloved
arm
still
about
her
and
these
were
her
thoughts
settling
like
flies
on
everything
when
she
opened
them
again
the
last
footsteps
were
passing
down
the
aisle
the
dripping
cups
were
being
replaced
by
the
ministers
and
covered
with
napkins
and
the
tale
of
easter
was
in
telling
from
the
pulpit
like
the
promise
of
a
brighter
day
and
they
said
one
to
another
who
shall
roll
us
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
when
they
looked
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
for
it
was
a
very
great
one
so
read
the
minister
and
closed
the
book
and
began
in
the
evening
when
all
was
over
and
the
prayers
said
and
the
expounding
and
catechising
finished
in
a
kind
of
despair
she
slipped
away
alone
and
walked
a
little
by
herself
in
the
deepening
twilight
beside
the
river
and
again
she
made
effort
after
effort
to
catch
some
consciousness
of
grace
from
this
sacrament
sunday
so
rare
and
so
precious
but
an
oppression
seemed
to
dwell
in
the
very
air
the
low
hung
over
the
city
leaden
and
chill
the
path
where
she
walked
was
rank
with
the
smell
of
dead
leaves
and
the
trees
and
grass
dripped
with
lifeless
moisture
as
she
goaded
and
allured
alternately
her
own
fainting
soul
it
writhed
and
struggled
but
could
not
rise
there
was
no
pungency
of
bitterness
in
her
no
thrill
of
joy
in
her
aspiration
for
the
hand
of
calvin
god
lay
heavy
on
the
delicate
languid
thing
she
walked
back
at
last
in
despair
over
the
wet
cobblestones
of
the
empty
market
square
but
as
she
came
near
the
house
she
saw
that
the
square
was
not
quite
empty
a
horse
stood
blowing
and
steaming
before
carrington
door
and
her
own
maid
and
kate
were
standing
hatless
in
the
doorway
looking
up
and
down
the
street
isabel
heart
began
to
beat
and
she
walked
quicker
in
a
moment
kate
saw
her
and
began
to
beckon
and
call
and
the
maid
ran
to
meet
her
mistress
isabel
mistress
isabel
she
cried
make
haste
what
is
it
asked
the
girl
in
sick
foreboding
there
is
a
man
come
from
great
keynes
began
the
maid
but
kate
stopped
her
come
in
mistress
isabel
she
said
my
father
is
waiting
for
you
carrington
met
her
at
the
door
and
his
face
was
tender
and
full
of
emotion
what
is
it
whispered
the
girl
sharply
anthony
dear
child
he
said
come
in
and
be
brave
there
was
a
man
standing
in
the
room
with
cap
and
whip
in
hand
spurred
and
splashed
from
head
to
foot
isabel
recognised
one
of
the
grooms
from
the
hall
what
is
it
she
said
again
with
a
piteous
sharpness
carrington
laid
his
hands
gently
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
into
her
eyes
it
is
news
of
your
father
he
said
from
lady
maxwell
he
paused
and
the
steady
gleam
of
his
eyes
strengthened
and
quieted
her
then
he
went
on
deliberately
the
lord
hath
given
and
the
lord
hath
taken
it
he
paused
as
if
for
an
answer
but
no
answer
came
isabel
was
staring
with
parted
lips
into
those
strong
blue
eyes
of
his
and
he
finished
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
chapter
xii
a
the
curtained
windows
on
the
of
the
dower
house
shone
red
from
within
as
isabel
and
carrington
with
three
or
four
servants
behind
rode
round
the
curving
drive
in
front
late
on
the
monday
evening
a
face
peeped
from
carroll
window
as
the
horse
hoofs
sounded
on
the
gravel
and
by
the
time
that
isabel
pale
wet
and
with
her
seventy
miles
ride
was
dismounted
mistress
margaret
herself
was
at
the
door
with
anthony
face
at
her
shoulder
and
carroll
looking
over
the
banisters
isabel
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
father
body
that
night
but
after
she
was
in
bed
lady
maxwell
herself
who
had
been
sent
for
when
he
lay
dying
came
down
from
the
hall
and
told
her
what
there
was
to
tell
while
mistress
margaret
and
anthony
entertained
carrington
below
dear
child
said
the
old
lady
leaning
with
her
elbow
on
the
bed
and
holding
the
girl
hand
tenderly
as
she
talked
it
was
all
over
in
an
hour
or
two
it
was
the
heart
you
know
carroll
sent
for
me
suddenly
on
saturday
morning
and
by
the
time
i
reached
him
he
could
not
speak
they
had
carried
him
upstairs
from
his
study
where
they
had
found
him
and
laid
him
down
on
his
bed
and
yes
yes
he
was
in
pain
but
he
was
conscious
and
he
was
praying
i
think
his
lips
moved
and
i
knelt
down
by
the
bed
and
prayed
aloud
he
only
spoke
twice
and
my
dear
it
was
your
name
the
first
time
and
the
name
of
his
saviour
the
second
time
he
looked
at
me
and
i
could
see
he
was
trying
to
speak
and
then
on
a
sudden
he
spoke
and
i
think
he
was
asking
me
to
take
care
of
you
and
i
nodded
and
said
that
i
would
do
what
i
could
and
he
seemed
satisfied
and
shut
his
eyes
again
and
then
presently
bodder
began
a
prayer
he
had
come
in
a
moment
before
they
could
not
find
him
at
first
and
then
and
then
your
dear
father
moved
a
little
and
raised
his
hand
and
the
minister
stayed
and
he
was
looking
up
as
if
he
saw
something
and
then
he
said
once
clear
and
loud
and
and
that
was
all
dear
child
the
next
morning
she
and
anthony
with
the
two
old
ladies
one
of
whom
was
always
with
them
during
these
days
went
into
the
darkened
oak
room
on
the
first
floor
where
he
had
died
and
now
rested
the
red
curtains
made
a
pleasant
rosy
light
and
it
seemed
to
the
children
impossible
to
believe
that
that
serene
face
scarcely
more
serene
than
in
life
with
its
wide
closed
lids
under
the
delicate
eyebrows
and
contented
mouth
and
the
scholarly
hands
closed
on
the
breast
all
in
a
wealth
of
autumn
flowers
and
dark
beech
leaves
were
not
the
face
and
hands
of
a
sleeping
man
but
isabel
did
not
utterly
break
down
till
she
saw
his
study
she
drew
the
curtains
aside
herself
and
there
stood
his
table
his
chair
was
beside
it
pushed
back
and
sideways
as
if
he
had
that
moment
left
it
and
on
the
table
itself
the
books
she
knew
so
well
in
the
centre
of
the
table
stood
his
inlaid
desk
with
the
papers
lying
upon
it
and
his
quill
beside
them
as
if
just
laid
down
even
the
was
uncovered
just
as
he
had
left
it
as
the
agony
began
to
lay
its
hand
upon
his
heart
she
stooped
and
read
the
last
sentence
this
is
the
great
fruit
that
unspeakable
benefit
that
they
do
eat
and
drink
of
that
labour
and
are
burden
and
come
and
there
it
stopped
and
the
blinding
tears
rushed
into
the
girl
eyes
as
she
stooped
to
kiss
the
curved
knob
of
the
where
his
dear
hand
had
last
rested
when
all
was
over
a
day
or
two
later
the
two
went
up
to
stay
at
the
hall
while
the
housekeeper
was
left
in
charge
of
the
dower
house
lady
maxwell
and
mistress
margaret
had
been
present
at
the
parish
church
on
the
occasion
of
the
funeral
for
the
first
time
ever
since
the
old
marian
priest
had
left
and
had
assisted
too
at
the
opening
of
the
will
which
was
found
tied
up
and
docketed
in
one
of
the
inner
drawers
of
the
inlaid
desk
and
before
its
instructions
were
complied
with
lady
maxwell
wished
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
isabel
and
anthony
she
made
an
opportunity
on
the
morning
of
anthony
departure
for
cambridge
two
days
after
the
funeral
when
mistress
margaret
was
out
of
the
room
and
hubert
had
ridden
off
as
usual
with
piers
on
the
affairs
of
the
estate
my
child
said
she
to
isabel
who
was
lying
back
passive
and
listless
on
the
what
do
you
think
your
cousin
will
direct
to
be
done
he
will
scarcely
wish
you
to
leave
home
altogether
to
stay
with
him
and
yet
you
understand
he
is
your
guardian
isabel
shook
her
head
we
know
nothing
of
him
she
said
wearily
he
has
never
been
here
if
you
have
a
suggestion
to
make
to
him
you
should
decide
at
once
the
other
went
on
the
courier
is
to
go
on
monday
is
he
not
anthony
the
boy
nodded
but
will
he
not
allow
us
he
said
to
stay
at
home
as
usual
surely
lady
maxwell
shook
her
head
and
isabel
she
asked
who
will
look
after
her
when
you
are
away
mrs
carroll
he
said
interrogatively
again
she
shook
her
head
he
would
never
consent
she
said
it
would
not
be
right
isabel
looked
up
suddenly
and
her
eyes
brightened
a
little
lady
maxwell
she
began
and
then
stopped
embarrassed
well
my
dear
what
is
it
isabel
asked
anthony
if
it
were
possible
but
but
i
could
not
ask
it
if
you
mean
margaret
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
serenely
drawing
her
needle
carefully
through
it
was
what
i
thought
myself
but
i
did
not
know
if
you
would
care
for
that
is
that
what
you
meant
oh
lady
maxwell
said
the
girl
her
face
lighting
up
then
the
old
lady
explained
that
it
was
not
possible
to
ask
them
to
live
permanently
at
the
hall
although
of
course
isabel
must
do
so
until
an
arrangement
had
been
made
because
their
father
would
scarcely
have
wished
them
to
be
actually
inmates
of
a
catholic
house
but
that
he
plainly
had
encouraged
close
relations
between
the
two
houses
and
indeed
lady
maxwell
interpreted
his
mention
of
his
daughter
name
and
his
look
as
he
said
it
in
the
sense
that
he
wished
those
relations
to
continue
she
thought
therefore
that
there
was
no
reason
why
their
new
guardian
consent
should
not
be
asked
to
mistress
margaret
coming
over
to
the
dower
house
to
take
charge
of
isabel
if
the
girl
wished
it
he
had
no
particular
interest
in
them
he
lived
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
away
and
the
arrangement
would
probably
save
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
inconvenience
but
you
lady
maxwell
isabel
burst
out
her
face
kindled
with
hope
for
she
had
dreaded
the
removal
terribly
you
will
be
lonely
here
dear
child
said
the
old
lady
laying
down
her
embroidery
god
has
been
gracious
to
me
and
my
husband
is
coming
back
to
me
you
need
not
fear
for
me
and
she
told
them
with
her
old
eyes
full
of
happy
tears
how
she
had
had
a
private
word
which
they
must
not
repeat
from
a
catholic
friend
at
court
that
all
had
been
decided
for
sir
release
though
he
did
not
know
it
himself
yet
and
that
he
would
be
at
home
again
for
advent
the
prison
fever
was
beginning
to
cause
alarm
and
it
seemed
that
a
good
fine
would
meet
the
old
knight
case
better
than
any
other
execution
of
justice
so
then
it
was
decided
and
as
isabel
walked
out
to
the
gatehouse
after
dinner
beside
anthony
with
her
hand
on
his
horse
neck
and
as
she
watched
him
at
last
ride
down
the
village
green
and
disappear
round
behind
the
church
half
her
sorrow
at
losing
him
was
swallowed
up
in
the
practical
certainty
that
they
would
meet
again
before
christmas
in
their
old
home
and
not
in
a
stranger
house
in
the
bleak
north
country
on
the
following
thursday
sir
nicholas
weekly
letter
showed
evidence
that
the
good
news
of
his
release
had
begun
to
penetrate
to
him
his
wife
longed
to
tell
him
all
she
had
heard
but
so
many
jealous
eyes
were
on
the
watch
for
favouritism
that
she
had
been
strictly
forbidden
to
pass
on
her
information
however
there
was
little
need
i
am
in
hopes
he
wrote
of
keeping
christmas
in
a
merrier
place
than
prison
i
do
not
mean
he
hastened
to
add
for
fear
of
alarming
his
wife
good
jakes
tells
me
that
sir
john
is
ill
and
that
he
fears
the
and
if
it
is
the
sweetheart
which
pray
god
it
may
not
be
sir
john
it
will
be
the
fourteenth
case
in
the
tower
and
folks
say
that
we
shall
all
be
let
home
again
but
with
another
good
fine
they
say
to
keep
us
poor
and
humble
and
mindful
of
the
queen
majesty
her
laws
however
dearest
i
would
gladly
pay
a
thousand
pounds
if
i
had
them
to
be
home
again
but
there
was
news
at
the
end
of
the
letter
that
caused
consternation
in
one
or
two
hearts
and
sent
hubert
across
storming
and
almost
crying
to
isabel
who
was
taking
a
turn
in
the
dusk
at
sunset
she
heard
his
step
beyond
the
hedge
quick
and
impatient
and
stopped
short
hesitating
and
wondering
he
had
behaved
to
her
with
extraordinary
tact
and
consideration
and
she
was
very
conscious
of
it
since
her
sudden
return
ten
days
before
from
the
visit
which
had
been
meant
to
separate
them
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
her
privately
except
a
shy
sentence
or
two
of
condolence
stammered
out
with
downcast
eyes
but
which
from
the
simplicity
and
shortness
of
the
words
had
brought
up
a
sob
from
her
heart
she
guessed
that
he
knew
why
she
had
been
sent
to
northampton
and
had
determined
not
to
take
advantage
in
any
way
of
her
sorrow
every
morning
he
had
disappeared
before
she
came
down
and
did
not
come
back
till
supper
where
he
sat
silent
and
apart
and
yet
when
an
occasion
offered
itself
behaved
with
a
quick
attentive
deference
that
showed
her
where
his
thoughts
had
been
now
she
stood
wondering
and
timid
at
that
hurried
insistent
step
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
as
she
hesitated
he
came
quickly
through
the
doorway
and
stopped
short
mistress
isabel
he
said
with
all
his
reserve
gone
and
looking
at
her
imploringly
but
with
the
old
familiar
air
that
she
loved
have
you
heard
i
am
to
go
as
soon
as
my
father
comes
back
oh
it
is
a
shame
his
voice
was
full
of
tears
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
angry
her
heart
leapt
up
once
and
then
seemed
to
cease
beating
go
she
said
and
even
as
she
spoke
knew
from
her
own
dismay
how
dear
that
quiet
chivalrous
presence
was
to
her
yes
he
went
on
in
the
same
voice
oh
i
know
i
should
not
speak
and
and
especially
now
at
all
times
but
i
could
not
bear
it
nor
that
you
should
think
it
was
my
will
to
go
she
stood
still
looking
at
him
may
i
walk
with
you
a
little
he
said
but
i
must
not
say
much
i
promised
my
father
and
then
as
they
walked
he
began
to
pour
it
out
it
is
some
old
man
in
durham
he
said
and
i
am
to
see
to
his
estates
my
father
will
not
want
me
here
when
he
comes
back
and
and
it
is
to
be
soon
he
has
had
the
offer
for
me
and
has
written
to
tell
me
there
is
no
choice
she
had
turned
instinctively
towards
the
house
and
the
high
roofs
and
chimneys
were
before
them
dark
against
the
luminous
sky
no
no
said
hubert
laying
his
hand
on
her
arm
and
at
the
touch
she
thrilled
so
much
that
she
knew
she
must
not
stay
and
went
forward
resolutely
up
the
steps
of
the
terrace
ah
let
me
speak
he
said
i
have
not
troubled
you
much
mistress
isabel
she
hesitated
again
a
moment
in
my
father
room
he
went
on
and
i
will
bring
the
letter
she
nodded
and
passed
into
the
hall
without
speaking
and
turned
to
sir
nicholas
study
while
hubert
steps
dashed
up
the
stairs
to
his
mother
room
isabel
went
in
and
stood
on
the
hearth
in
the
firelight
that
glowed
and
wavered
round
the
room
on
the
tapestry
and
the
and
the
table
where
hubert
had
been
sitting
and
the
tall
shuttered
windows
leaning
her
head
against
the
mantelpiece
doubtful
and
miserable
listen
said
hubert
bursting
into
the
room
a
moment
later
with
the
sheet
open
in
his
hand
hubert
that
lord
arncliffe
needs
a
gentleman
to
take
charge
of
his
estates
he
is
too
old
now
himself
and
has
none
to
help
him
i
have
had
the
offer
for
hubert
and
have
accepted
it
he
must
go
as
soon
as
i
have
returned
i
am
sorry
to
lose
the
lad
but
since
james
and
hubert
broke
off
i
must
not
read
that
he
said
isabel
still
stood
stretching
her
hands
out
to
the
fire
turned
a
little
away
from
him
but
what
can
i
say
went
on
the
lad
passionately
i
must
go
and
and
god
knows
for
how
long
five
or
six
years
maybe
and
i
shall
come
back
and
find
you
and
find
you
and
a
sob
rose
up
and
silenced
him
hubert
she
said
turning
and
looking
with
a
kind
of
wavering
steadiness
into
his
shadowed
eyes
and
even
then
noticing
the
features
and
the
smooth
curve
of
his
jaw
with
the
firelight
on
it
you
ought
not
i
know
i
know
i
promised
my
father
but
there
are
some
things
i
can
not
bear
of
course
i
do
not
want
you
to
promise
anything
but
i
thought
that
if
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
that
you
thought
that
you
thought
there
would
be
no
one
else
and
that
when
i
came
back
hubert
she
said
again
resolutely
it
is
impossible
our
religions
but
i
would
do
anything
i
think
besides
in
five
years
so
much
may
happen
you
might
become
a
catholic
or
or
i
might
come
to
see
that
the
protestant
religion
was
nearly
the
same
or
as
true
at
least
or
or
so
much
might
can
you
not
tell
me
anything
before
i
go
a
keen
ray
of
hope
had
pierced
her
heart
as
he
spoke
and
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
said
but
hubert
even
if
i
were
to
say
he
seized
her
hands
and
kissed
them
again
and
again
oh
god
bless
you
isabel
now
i
can
go
so
happily
and
i
will
not
speak
of
it
again
you
can
trust
me
it
will
not
be
hard
for
you
she
tried
to
draw
her
hands
away
but
he
still
held
them
tightly
in
his
own
strong
hands
and
looked
into
her
face
his
eyes
were
shining
yes
yes
i
know
you
have
promised
nothing
i
hold
you
to
nothing
you
are
as
free
as
ever
to
do
what
you
will
with
me
but
and
he
lifted
her
hands
once
more
and
kissed
them
and
dropped
them
seized
his
cap
and
was
gone
isabel
was
left
alone
in
a
tumult
of
thought
and
emotion
he
had
taken
her
by
storm
she
had
not
guessed
how
desperately
weak
she
was
towards
him
until
he
had
come
to
her
like
this
in
a
whirlwind
of
passion
and
stood
trembling
and
almost
crying
with
the
ruddy
firelight
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
burning
out
of
shadow
she
felt
fascinated
still
by
that
mingling
of
a
boy
weakness
and
sentiment
and
of
a
man
fire
and
purpose
and
she
sank
down
on
her
knees
before
the
hearth
and
looked
wonderingly
at
her
hands
which
he
had
kissed
so
ardently
now
transparent
and
flaming
against
the
light
as
if
with
love
then
as
she
looked
at
the
red
heart
of
the
fire
the
sudden
leaping
of
her
heart
quieted
and
there
crept
on
her
a
glow
of
steady
desire
to
lean
on
the
power
of
this
tall
young
lover
of
hers
she
was
so
utterly
alone
without
him
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
no
choice
left
he
had
come
and
claimed
her
in
virtue
of
the
and
she
how
much
had
she
yielded
she
had
not
promised
but
she
had
shown
evidently
her
real
heart
in
those
half
dozen
words
and
he
had
interpreted
them
for
her
and
she
dared
not
in
honesty
repudiate
his
interpretation
and
so
she
knelt
there
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
in
a
whirl
of
delight
and
trembling
all
the
bounds
of
that
sober
inner
life
seemed
for
the
moment
swept
away
she
almost
began
to
despise
its
old
coldnesses
and
limitations
how
shadowy
after
all
was
the
love
of
god
compared
with
this
burning
tide
that
was
bearing
her
along
on
its
bosom
she
sank
lower
and
lower
into
herself
among
the
black
draperies
clasping
those
slender
hands
tightly
across
her
breast
suddenly
a
great
log
fell
with
a
crash
the
red
glow
turned
into
leaping
flames
the
whole
dark
room
seemed
alive
with
shadows
that
fled
to
and
fro
and
she
knelt
upright
quickly
and
looked
round
her
terrified
and
what
was
she
doing
here
was
it
so
soon
then
that
she
was
setting
aside
the
will
of
her
father
who
trusted
and
loved
her
so
well
and
who
lay
out
there
in
the
chancel
vault
ah
she
had
no
right
here
in
this
room
hubert
room
now
with
his
cap
and
whip
lying
across
the
papers
and
the
and
his
knife
and
the
broken
jesses
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
beside
her
there
was
his
step
overhead
again
she
must
be
gone
before
he
came
back
there
was
high
excitement
on
the
estate
and
in
the
village
a
week
or
two
later
when
the
rumour
of
sir
nicholas
return
was
established
and
the
paper
had
been
pinned
up
to
the
gatehouse
stating
in
lady
maxwell
own
handwriting
that
he
would
be
back
sometime
in
the
week
before
advent
sunday
reminiscences
were
exchanged
of
the
glorious
day
when
the
old
knight
came
of
age
over
forty
years
ago
of
the
sports
on
the
green
of
the
for
the
gentlefolks
and
the
archery
in
the
meadow
behind
the
church
for
the
vulgar
of
the
high
mass
and
the
dinner
that
followed
it
it
was
rumoured
that
hubert
and
piers
had
already
selected
the
ox
that
was
to
be
roasted
whole
and
that
materials
for
the
bonfire
were
in
process
of
collection
in
the
woodyard
of
the
home
farm
sir
nicholas
letters
became
more
and
more
emphatically
underlined
and
incoherent
as
the
days
went
on
and
lady
maxwell
less
and
less
willing
for
isabel
to
read
them
but
the
girl
often
found
the
old
lady
hastily
putting
away
the
thin
sheets
which
she
had
just
taken
out
to
read
to
herself
once
again
on
which
her
dear
lord
had
scrawled
down
his
very
heart
itself
as
if
his
courting
of
her
were
all
to
do
again
it
was
not
until
the
saturday
morning
that
the
courier
rode
in
through
the
gatehouse
with
the
news
that
sir
nicholas
was
to
be
released
that
day
and
would
be
down
if
possible
before
nightfall
all
the
men
on
the
estate
were
immediately
called
in
and
sent
home
to
dress
themselves
and
an
escort
of
a
dozen
grooms
and
servants
led
by
hubert
and
piers
rode
out
at
once
on
the
north
road
with
torches
ready
for
kindling
to
meet
the
party
and
bring
them
home
and
all
other
preparations
were
set
forward
at
once
towards
eight
lady
maxwell
was
so
anxious
and
restless
that
isabel
slipped
out
and
went
down
to
the
gatehouse
to
look
out
for
herself
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
approach
of
the
party
she
went
up
to
one
of
the
little
octagonal
towers
and
looked
out
towards
the
green
it
was
a
clear
starlight
night
but
towards
the
village
all
was
bathed
in
the
dancing
ruddy
light
of
the
bonfire
it
was
burning
on
a
little
mound
at
the
upper
end
of
the
green
just
below
where
isabel
stood
and
a
heavy
curtain
of
smoke
drifted
westwards
as
she
looked
down
on
it
she
saw
against
it
the
tall
black
posts
of
the
gigantic
jack
and
the
slowly
revolving
carcass
of
the
ox
and
round
about
the
stirring
crowd
of
the
village
folk
their
figures
black
on
this
side
luminous
on
that
she
could
even
make
out
the
cassock
and
square
cap
of
bodder
as
he
moved
among
his
flock
the
rows
of
houses
on
either
side
bright
and
clear
at
this
end
melted
away
into
darkness
at
the
lower
end
of
the
green
where
on
the
right
the
church
tower
rose
up
blotting
out
the
stars
itself
just
touched
with
ruddy
light
and
on
the
top
of
which
like
a
large
star
itself
burned
the
torch
of
the
watcher
who
was
looking
out
towards
the
north
road
there
was
a
ceaseless
hum
of
noise
from
the
green
pierced
by
the
shrill
cries
of
the
children
round
the
glowing
mass
of
the
bonfire
but
there
was
no
disorder
as
the
barrels
that
had
been
rolled
out
of
the
hall
cellars
that
afternoon
still
stood
untouched
beneath
the
rectory
isabel
contrasted
in
her
mind
this
pleasant
human
tumult
with
the
angry
roaring
she
had
heard
from
these
same
a
few
months
before
when
she
had
followed
lady
maxwell
out
to
the
rescue
of
the
woman
who
had
injured
her
and
she
wondered
at
these
strange
souls
who
attended
a
protestant
service
but
were
so
fierce
and
so
genial
in
their
defence
and
welcome
of
a
catholic
squire
as
she
thought
there
was
a
sudden
movement
of
the
light
on
the
church
tower
it
tossed
violently
up
and
down
and
a
moment
later
the
jubilant
clangour
of
the
bells
broke
out
there
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
figures
on
the
green
and
a
burst
of
cheering
rose
isabel
strained
her
eyes
northwards
but
the
road
took
a
turn
beyond
the
church
and
she
could
see
nothing
but
darkness
and
stars
and
one
glimmering
window
she
turned
instinctively
to
the
house
behind
her
and
there
was
the
door
flung
wide
and
she
could
make
out
the
figures
of
the
two
ladies
against
the
brightly
lit
hall
beyond
wrapped
like
herself
in
cloak
and
hood
for
the
night
was
frosty
and
cold
as
she
turned
once
more
she
heard
the
clear
rattle
of
trotting
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
and
a
glow
began
to
be
visible
at
the
lower
dark
end
of
the
village
the
cheering
rose
higher
and
the
bells
were
all
clashing
together
in
melodious
discord
as
in
the
angle
of
the
road
a
group
of
tossing
torches
appeared
then
she
could
make
out
the
horsemen
three
riding
together
and
the
others
as
escort
round
them
the
crowd
had
poured
off
the
grass
on
to
the
road
by
now
and
the
horses
were
coming
up
between
two
shouting
gesticulating
lines
which
closed
after
them
as
they
went
now
she
could
make
out
the
white
hair
of
sir
nicholas
as
he
bowed
right
and
left
and
hubert
feathered
cap
on
one
side
of
him
and
boyd
black
hat
on
the
other
they
had
passed
the
bonfire
now
and
were
coming
up
the
avenue
the
crowds
still
streaming
after
them
and
the
church
tower
bellowing
rough
music
overhead
isabel
leaned
out
over
the
battlements
and
saw
beneath
her
the
two
old
ladies
waiting
just
outside
the
gate
by
the
and
then
she
drew
back
her
eyes
full
of
tears
for
she
saw
sir
nicholas
face
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
wife
there
was
a
sudden
silence
as
the
horses
drew
up
and
the
crowds
ceased
shouting
and
when
isabel

sir
nicholas
was
on
the
the
two
ladies
immediately
behind
him
and
the
people
pressing
forward
to
hear
his
voice
it
was
a
very
short
speech
and
isabel

not

more
than
detached
phrases

again

broke
out
and
isabel
crossed
over
to
see

pass
up
to

to
the
bright

wide
for

as

watched

go
up

behind

suddenly
dropped
her

on
to
the
cold

drew
a
sharp
breath

again
what

part
ii
chapter
i
anthony
in
london
the
development
of
a
nation
is
strangely
paralleled
by
the
development
of
an
individual
there
comes
in
both
a
period
of
adolescence
of
the
stirring
of
new
powers
of
an
increase
of
strength
of
the
dawn
of
new
ideals
of
the
awaking
of
contours
become
defined
and
abrupt
awkward
and
hasty
movements
succeed
to
the
grace
of
childhood
and
there
is
a
curious
mingling
of
refinement
and
brutality
stupidity
and
tenderness
the
will
is
subject
to
whims
it
is
easily
roused
and
not
so
easily
quieted
yet
in
spite
of
the
attendant
discomforts
the
whole
period
is
undeniably
one
of
growth
the
reign
of
elizabeth
coincided
with
this
stage
in
the
development
of
england
the
young
vigour
was
beginning
to
stir
and
hawkins
and
drake
taught
the
world
that
it
was
so
and
that
when
england
stretched
herself
catastrophe
abroad
must
follow
she
loved
finery
and
feathers
and
velvet
and
to
see
herself
on
the
dramatic
stage
and
to
sing
her
there
as
a
growing
maid
dresses
up
and
leans
on
her
hand
and
looks
into
her
own
eyes
in
the
mirror
and
marlowe
and
greene
and
shakespeare
are
witnesses
to
it
yet
she
loved
to
hang
over
the
arena
too
and
watch
the
and
see
the
blood
and
foam
and
listen
to
the
snarl
of
the
hounds
as
a
lad
loves
sport
and
things
that
minister
death
her
policy
too
under
elizabeth
as
her
genius
was
awkward
and
and
capricious
and
yet
strong
and
successful
in
the
end
as
a
growing
lad
while
he
is
clumsier
yet
manages
to
leap
higher
than
a
year
ago
and
once
more
to
carry
the
parallel
still
further
during
the
middle
period
of
the
reign
while
the
balance
of
parties
and
powers
remained
much
the
same
principles
and
tendencies
began
to
assert
themselves
more
definitely
just
as
muscles
and
sinews
begin
to
appear
through
the
round
contour
of
the
limbs
of
a
growing
child
thus
from
to
while
there
was
no
startling
reversal
of
elements
in
the
affairs
of
england
the
entire
situation
became
more
defined
the
various
parties
though
they
scarcely
changed
in
their
mutual
relations
yet
continued
to
develop
swiftly
along
their
respective
lines
growing
more
pronounced
and
less
inclined
to
compromise
foreign
enmities
and
expectations
became
more
acute
plots
against
the
life
more
frequent
and
serious
and
the
countermining
of
them
under
walsingham
more
patient
and
skilful
competition
and
enterprise
in
trade
more
strenuous
scottish
affairs
more
complicated
movements
of
revolt
and
repression
in
ireland
more
violent
what
was
true
of
politics
was
also
true
of
religious
matters
for
the
two
were
inextricably
mingled
the
puritans
daily
became
more
clamorous
and
intolerant
their
exercises
more
turbulent
and
their
demands
more
unreasonable
and
the
papists
became
at
once
more
numerous
and
more
strict
and
the
government
measures
more
stern
in
consequence
the
act
of
made
it
no
less
a
crime
than
high
treason
to
reconcile
or
be
reconciled
to
the
church
of
rome
to
give
effect
to
a
papal
bull
to
be
in
possession
of
any
muniments
of
superstition
or
to
declare
the
queen
a
heretic
or
schismatic
the
church
of
england
too
under
the
wise
guidance
of
parker
had
begun
to
shape
her
course
more
and
more
resolutely
along
the
lines
of
inclusiveness
and
moderation
to
realise
herself
as
representing
the
religious
voice
of
a
nation
that
was
widely
divided
on
matters
of
faith
and
to
attempt
to
include
within
her
fold
every
individual
that
was
not
an
absolute
fanatic
in
the
papist
or
puritan
direction
thus
in
every
department
in
home
and
foreign
politics
in
art
and
literature
and
in
religious
independence
england
was
rising
and
shaking
herself
free
the
last
threads
that
bound
her
to
the
continent
were
snapped
by
the
reformation
and
she
was
standing
with
her
soul
as
she
thought
awake
and
free
at
last
conscious
of
her
beauty
and
her
strength
ready
to
step
out
at
last
before
the
world
as
a
dominant
and
imperious
power
anthony
norris
had
been
arrested
like
so
many
others
by
the
vision
of
this
young
country
of
his
his
mother
and
mistress
who
stood
there
waiting
to
be
served
he
had
left
cambridge
in
and
for
three
years
had
led
a
somewhat
aimless
life
for
his
guardian
allowed
him
a
generous
income
out
of
his
father
fortune
he
had
stayed
with
hubert
in
the
north
had
yawned
and
stretched
himself
at
great
keynes
had
gone
to
and
fro
among
friends
houses
and
had
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
to
which
he
was
aided
by
a
chorus
of
advisers
that
he
was
wasting
his
time
he
had
begun
then
to
look
round
him
for
some
occupation
and
in
the
final
choice
of
it
his
early
religious
training
had
formed
a
large
element
it
had
kept
alive
in
him
a
certain
sense
of
the
supernatural
that
his
exuberance
of
physical
life
might
otherwise
have
crushed
and
now
as
he
looked
about
to
see
how
he
could
serve
his
country
he
became
aware
that
her
ecclesiastical
character
had
a
certain
attraction
for
him
he
had
had
indeed
an
idea
of
taking
orders
but
he
had
relinquished
this
by
now
though
he
still
desired
if
he
might
to
serve
the
national
church
in
some
other
capacity
there
was
much
in
the
church
of
england
to
appeal
to
her
sons
if
there
was
a
lack
of
unity
in
her
faith
and
policy
yet
that
was
largely
out
of
sight
and
her
bearing
was
gallant
and
impressive
she
had
great
wealth
great
power
and
great
dignity
the
ancient
buildings
and
revenues
were
hers
the
civil
power
was
at
her
disposal
and
the
queen
was
eager
to
further
her
influence
and
to
protect
her
bishops
from
the
encroaching
power
of
parliament
claiming
only
for
the
crown
the
right
to
be
the
point
of
union
for
both
the
secular
and
ecclesiastical
sections
of
the
nation
and
to
stamp
by
her
royal
approval
or
annul
by
her
veto
the
acts
of
parliament
and
convocation
alike
it
seemed
then
to
eyes
that
the
church
of
england
had
a
tremendous
destiny
before
her
as
the
religious
voice
of
the
nation
that
was
beginning
to
make
itself
so
dominant
in
the
council
of
the
world
and
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
influence
she
might
exercise
by
disciplining
the
exuberant
strength
of
england
and
counteracting
by
her
soberness
and
the
passionate
fanaticism
of
the
latin
nations
so
little
by
little
in
place
of
the
shadowy
individualism
that
was
all
that
he
knew
of
religion
there
rose
before
him
the
vision
of
a
living
church
who
came
forth
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
surrounded
by
all
the
loyalty
that
nationalism
could
give
her
with
the
queen
herself
as
her
guardian
and
great
princes
and
prelates
as
her
supporters
while
at
the
wheels
of
her
splendid
car
walked
her
chivalrous
sons
who
served
her
and
spread
her
glories
by
land
and
sea
not
perhaps
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
her
spiritual
claims
but
because
she
was
bone
of
their
bone
and
was
no
less
zealous
than
themselves
for
the
name
and
character
of
england
when
therefore
towards
the
end
of
anthony
received
the
offer
of
a
position
in
the
household
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
through
the
recommendation
of
the
father
of
one
of
his
cambridge
friends
he
accepted
it
with
real
gratitude
and
enthusiasm
the
post
to
which
he
was
appointed
was
that
of
gentleman
of
the
horse
his
actual
duties
were
not
very
arduous
owing
to
the
special
circumstances
of
archbishop
grindal
and
he
had
a
good
deal
of
time
to
himself
briefly
they
were
as
follows
he
had
to
superintend
the
yeoman
of
the
horse
and
see
that
he
kept
full
accounts
of
all
the
horses
in
stable
or
at
pasture
and
of
all
the
carriages
and
harness
and
the
like
every
morning
he
had
to
present
himself
to
the
archbishop
and
receive
for
the
day
and
to
receive
from
the
yeoman
accounts
of
the
stables
every
month
he
examined
the
books
of
the
yeoman
before
passing
them
on
to
the
steward
his
permission
too
was
necessary
before
any
guest
or
stranger
horse
might
be
cared
for
in
the
lambeth
stables
he
was
responsible
also
for
all
the
men
and
boys
connected
with
the
stable
to
engage
them
watch
their
morals
and
even
the
performance
of
their
religious
duties
and
if
necessary
report
them
for
dismissal
to
the
steward
of
the
household
in
archbishop
parker
time
this
had
been
a
busy
post
as
the
state
observed
at
lambeth
and
croydon
was
very
considerable
but
grindal
was
of
a
more
retiring
nature
disliking
as
was
said
lordliness
and
although
still
the
household
was
an
immense
affair
in
its
elaborateness
and
splendour
beyond
almost
any
but
royal
households
of
the
present
day
still
anthony
duties
were
far
from
heavy
the
archbishop
indeed
at
first
dispensed
with
this
office
altogether
and
concentrated
all
the
supervision
of
the
stable
on
the
yeoman
and
anthony
was
the
first
and
only
gentleman
of
the
horse
that
archbishop
grindal
employed
the
disgrace
and
punishment
under
which
the
archbishop
fell
so
early
in
his
archiepiscopate
made
this
particular
post
easier
than
it
would
even
otherwise
have
been
as
fewer
equipages
were
required
when
the
archbishop
was
confined
to
his
house
and
the
establishment
was
yet
further
reduced
ordinarily
then
his
duties
were
over
by
eleven
except
when
special
arrangements
were
to
be
made
he
rose
early
waited
upon
the
archbishop
by
eight
and
received
his
orders
for
the
day
then
interviewed
the
yeoman
sometimes
visited
the
stables
to
receive
complaints
and
was
ready
by
ten
to
go
to
the
chapel
for
the
morning
prayers
with
the
rest
of
the
household
at
eleven
he
dined
at
the
steward
table
in
the
great
hall
with
the
other
principal
officers
of
the
household
the
chaplain
the
secretaries
and
the
gentlemen
ushers
with
guests
of
lesser
degree
this
great
hall
with
its
two
entrances
at
the
lower
end
near
the
gateway
its
magnificent
roof
its
da√Øs
its
stained
glass
was
a
worthy
place
of
entertainment
and
had
been
the
scene
of
many
great
feasts
and
royal
visits
in
the
times
of
previous
archbishops
in
favour
with
the
sovereign
and
of
a
splendid
banquet
at
the
beginning
of
grindal
occupancy
of
the
see
now
however
things
were
changed
there
were
seldom
many
distinguished
persons
to
dine
with
the
disgraced
prelate
and
he
himself
preferred
too
to
entertain
those
who
could
not
repay
him
again
after
the
precept
of
the
gospel
and
besides
the
provision
for
the
numerous
less
important
guests
who
dined
daily
at
lambeth
a
great
tub
was
set
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
as
it
had
been
in
parker
time
and
every
day
after
dinner
under
the
direction
was
filled
with
food
from
the
tables
which
was
afterwards
distributed
at
the
gate
to
poor
people
of
the
neighbourhood
after
dinner
anthony
time
was
often
his
own
until
the
evening
prayers
at
six
followed
by
supper
again
spread
in
the
hall
it
was
necessary
for
him
always
to
sleep
in
the
house
unless
leave
was
obtained
from
the
steward
this
gentleman
john
scot
an
esquire
took
a
fancy
to
anthony
and
was
indulgent
to
him
in
many
ways
and
anthony
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
little
difficulty
in
coming
and
going
as
he
pleased
so
soon
as
his
morning
duties
were
done
lambeth
house
had
been
lately
restored
by
parker
and
was
now
a
very
beautiful
and
place
among
other
repairs
and
buildings
he
had
the
great
hall
that
stood
just
within
morton
gateway
he
had
built
a
long
pier
into
the
thames
where
the
barge
could
be
entered
easily
even
at
low
tide
he
had
rebuilt
the
famous
summerhouse
of
cranmer
in
the
garden
besides
doing
many
sanitary
alterations
and
repairs
and
the
house
was
well
kept
up
in
grindal
time
anthony
soon
added
a
great
affection
and
tenderness
to
the
awe
that
he
felt
for
the
archbishop
who
was
almost
from
the
first
a
pathetic
and
touching
figure
when
anthony
first
entered
on
his
duties
in
november
he
found
the
archbishop
in
his
last
days
of
freedom
and
good
favour
with
the
queen
elizabeth
he
soon
learnt
from
the
gossip
of
the
household
was
as
determined
to
put
down
the
puritan
prophesyings
as
the
popish
services
for
both
alike
tended
to
injure
the
peace
she
was
resolved
to
maintain
rumours
were
flying
to
and
fro
the
archbishop
was
continually
going
across
the
water
to
confer
with
his
friends
and
the
lords
of
the
council
and
messengers
came
and
went
all
day
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
archbishop
did
not
mean
to
yield
it
was
said
that
his
grace
had
sent
a
letter
to
her
majesty
bidding
her
not
to
meddle
with
what
did
not
concern
her
telling
her
that
she
too
would
one
day
have
to
render
account
before
christ
tribunal
and
warning
her
of
anger
if
she
persisted
her
majesty
had
sworn
like
a
trooper
a
royal
page
said
one
day
as
he
lounged
over
the
fire
in
the
and
had
declared
that
if
she
was
like
ozeas
and
ahab
and
the
rest
as
grindal
had
said
she
was
she
would
take
care
that
he
at
least
should
be
like
micaiah
the
son
of
imlah
before
she
had
done
with
him
then
it
began
to
leak
out
that
elizabeth
was
sending
her
commands
to
the
bishops
direct
instead
of
through
their
metropolitan
and
as
the
days
went
by
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
disgrace
was
beginning
to
shadow
lambeth
the
barges
that
drew
up
at
the
watergate
were
fewer
as
summer
went
on
and
the
long
tables
in
hall
were
more
and
more
deserted
even
the
archbishop
himself
seemed
silent
and
cast
down
anthony
used
to
watch
him
from
his
window
going
up
and
down
the
little
walled
garden
that
looked
upon
the
river
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
black
habit
gathered
up
in
them
and
his
chin
on
his
breast
he
would
be
longer
than
ever
too
in
chapel
after
the
morning
prayer
and
the
company
would
wait
and
wonder
in
the
anteroom
till
his
grace
came
in
and
gave
the
signal
for
dinner
and
at
last
the
blow
fell
on
one
day
in
june
anthony
who
had
been
on
a
visit
to
isabel
at
great
keynes
returned
to
lambeth
in
time
for
morning
prayer
and
dinner
just
before
the
gates
were
shut
by
the
porter
having
ridden
up
early
with
a
couple
of
grooms
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
air
of
constraint
abroad
as
the
guests
and
members
of
the
household
gathered
for
dinner
there
were
no
guests
of
high
dignity
that
day
and
the
archbishop
sat
at
his
own
table
silent
and
apart
anthony
from
his
place
at
the
table
noticed
that
he
ate
very
sparingly
and
that
he
appeared
even
more
preoccupied
and
distressed
than
usual
his
eyes
kind
and
brown
surrounded
by
wrinkles
from
his
habit
of
peering
closely
at
everything
seemed
full
of
sadness
and
perplexity
and
his
hand
fumbled
with
his
bread
continually
anthony
did
not
like
to
ask
anything
of
his
neighbours
as
there
were
one
or
two
strangers
dining
at
the
table
that
day
and
the
moment
dinner
was
over
and
grace
had
been
said
and
the
archbishop
retired
with
his
little
procession
preceded
by
a
white
wand
an
usher
came
running
back
to
tell
master
norris
that
his
grace
desired
to
see
him
at
once
in
the
inner
cloister
anthony
hastened
round
through
the
court
between
the
hall
and
the
river
and
found
the
archbishop
walking
up
and
down
in
his
black
habit
with
the
round
flapped
cap
that
as
a
puritan
he
preferred
to
the
square
of
the
more
clergy
still
looking
troubled
and
cast
down
continually
stroking
his
dark
forked
beard
and
talking
to
one
of
his
secretaries
anthony
stood
at
a
little
distance
at
the
open
side
of
the
court
near
the
river
cap
in
hand
waiting
till
the
archbishop
should
beckon
him
the
two
went
up
and
down
in
the
shade
in
the
open
court
outside
the
cloisters
where
the
pump
stood
and
where
the
pulpit
had
been
erected
for
the
queen
famous
visit
to
his
predecessor
when
she
had
sat
in
a
gallery
over
the
cloister
and
heard
the
sermon
on
the
north
rose
up
the
roof
of
the
chapel
the
cloisters
themselves
were
poor
buildings
little
more
than
passages
with
a
continuous
row
of
square
windows
running
along
them
the
height
of
a
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
secretary
left
the
archbishop
with
an
obeisance
and
hastened
into
the
house
through
the
cloister
and
presently
the
archbishop
after
a
turn
or
two
more
with
the
same
grave
air
peered
towards
anthony
and
then
called
him
anthony
immediately
came
towards
him
and
received
orders
that
half
a
dozen
horses
with
grooms
should
be
ready
as
soon
as
possible
who
were
to
receive
orders
from
richard
frampton
the
secretary
and
that
three
or
four
horses
more
were
to
be
kept
saddled
till
seven
that
evening
in
case
further
messages
were
wanted
and
i
desire
you
norris
said
the
archbishop
to
let
the
men
under
your
charge
know
that
their
master
is
in
trouble
with
the
grace
and
that
they
can
serve
him
best
by
being
prompt
and
obedient
anthony
bowed
to
the
archbishop
and
was
going
to
withdraw
but
the
archbishop
went
on
i
will
tell
you
he
said
for
your
private
ear
only
at
present
that
i
have
received
an
order
this
day
from
my
lords
of
the
council
bidding
me
to
keep
to
my
house
for
six
months
and
telling
me
that
i
am
sequestered
by
the
queen
desire
i
know
not
how
this
will
end
but
the
cause
is
that
i
will
not
do
her
grace
will
in
the
matter
of
the
exercises
as
i
wrote
to
tell
her
so
and
i
am
determined
by
god
grace
not
to
yield
in
this
thing
but
to
govern
the
charge
committed
to
me
as
he
gives
me
light
that
is
all
mr
norris
the
whole
household
was
cast
into
real
sorrow
by
the
blow
that
had
fallen
at
last
on
the
master
he
was
loving
and
grateful
to
servants
and
was
free
and
liberal
in
domestic
matters
and
it
needed
only
a
hint
that
he
was
in
trouble
for
his
officers
and
servants
to
do
their
utmost
for
him
anthony
sympathy
was
further
aroused
by
the
knowledge
that
the
papists
too
hated
the
old
man
and
longed
to
injure
him
there
had
been
a
great
increase
of
catholics
this
year
the
archbishop
of
york
had
reported
that
a
more
wilful
or
obstinate
people
did
he
never
hear
of
and
from
hereford
had
come
a
lament
that
conformity
itself
was
a
mockery
as
even
the
papists
that
attended
church
were
a
distraction
when
they
got
there
and
john
hareley
was
instanced
as
reading
so
loud
upon
his
latin
popish
primer
that
he
understands
not
that
he
troubles
both
minister
and
people
in
november
matters
were
so
serious
that
the
archbishop
felt
himself
obliged
to
take
steps
to
chastise
the
recusants
and
in
december
came
the
news
of
the
execution
of
cuthbert
maine
at
launceston
in
cornwall
how
much
the
catholics
resented
this
against
the
archbishop
was
brought
to
anthony
notice
a
day
or
two
later
he
was
riding
back
for
morning
prayer
after
an
errand
in
battersea
one
frosty
day
and
had
just
come
in
sight
of
morton
gateway
when
he
observed
a
man
standing
by
it
who
turned
and
ran
on
hearing
the
horse
footsteps
past
lambeth
church
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
meadows
behind
essex
house
anthony
checked
his
horse
doubtful
whether
to
follow
or
not
but
decided
to
see
what
it
was
that
the
man
had
left
pinned
to
the
door
he
rode
up
and
detached
it
and
found
it
was
a
violent
and
scurrilous
attack
upon
the
archbishop
for
his
supposed
share
in
the
death
of
the
two
papists
it
denounced
him
as
a
bloody
compared
him
to
pilate
and
bade
him
look
to
his
congregation
of
lewd
and
profane
persons
that
he
named
the
church
of
england
for
that
god
would
avenge
the
blood
of
his
saints
speedily
upon
their
murderers
anthony
carried
it
into
the
hall
and
after
showing
it
to
scot
put
it
indignantly
into
the
fire
the
steward
raised
his
eyebrows
why
so
master
norris
he
asked
why
said
anthony
sharply
you
would
not
have
me
frame
it
and
show
to
my
lord
i
am
not
sure
said
the
other
if
you
desire
to
injure
the
papists
such
foul
nonsense
is
their
best
condemnation
it
is
best
to
keep
evidence
against
a
traitor
not
destroy
it
besides
we
might
have
caught
the
knave
and
now
we
can
not
he
added
looking
at
the
black
shrivelling
sheet
half
regretfully
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
said
anthony
how
there
can
be
papists
why
they
hate
england
said
the
steward
briefly
as
the
bell
rang
for
morning
prayer
as
anthony
followed
him
along
the
gallery
he
thought
half
guiltily
of
sir
nicholas
and
his
lady
and
wondered
whether
that
was
true
of
them
but
he
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
true
of
catholics
as
a
class
they
had
ceased
to
be
english
the
cause
of
the
pope
and
the
queen
were
irreconcilable
and
so
the
whole
incident
added
more
fuel
to
the
hot
flame
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
that
burnt
so
bright
in
the
lad
soul
but
it
was
fanned
yet
higher
by
a
glimpse
he
had
of
and
he
owed
it
to
mary
corbet
whom
he
had
only
seen
momentarily
in
public
once
or
twice
and
never
to
speak
to
since
her
visit
to
great
keynes
over
six
years
ago
he
had
blushed
privately
and
bitten
his
lip
a
good
many
times
in
the
interval
when
he
thought
of
his
astonishing
infatuation
and
yet
the
glamour
had
never
wholly
faded
and
his
heart
quickened
perceptibly
when
he
opened
a
note
one
day
brought
by
a
royal
groom
that
asked
him
to
come
that
very
afternoon
if
he
could
to
whitehall
palace
where
mistress
corbet
would
be
delighted
to
see
him
and
renew
their
acquaintance
as
he
came
punctual
to
the
moment
into
the
gallery
overlooking
the
the
afternoon
sun
was
pouring
in
through
the
oriel
window
and
the
yard
beyond
seemed
all
a
haze
of
golden
light
and
dust
he
heard
an
exclamation
as
he
paused
dazzled
and
the
servant
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
there
came
forward
to
him
in
the
flood
of
glory
the
same
resplendent
figure
all
muslin
and
jewels
that
he
remembered
so
well
with
the
radiant
face
looking
scarcely
older
with
the
same
dancing
eyes
and
scarlet
lips
all
the
old
charm
seemed
to
envelop
him
in
a
moment
as
he
saluted
her
with
all
the
courtesy
of
which
he
was
capable
ah
she
cried
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
again
those
dear
days
at
great
keynes
and
she
took
both
his
hands
with
such
ardour
that
poor
anthony
was
almost
forced
to
think
that
he
had
never
been
out
of
her
thoughts
since
how
can
i
serve
you
mistress
corbet
he
asked
serve
me
why
by
talking
to
me
and
telling
me
of
the
country
what
does
the
lad
mean
come
and
sit
here
she
said
and
she
drew
him
to
the
window
seat
anthony
looked
out
into
the
shining
haze
of
the
some
one
with
a
long
pole
was
struggling
violently
on
the
back
of
a
horse
jerking
the
reins
and
cursing
audibly
look
at
that
fool
said
mary
he
thinks
his
horse
as
great
a
dolt
as
himself
chris
chris
she
screamed
through
her
hands
you
sodden
ass
be
quieter
with
the
poor
beast
soothe
him
soothe
him
he
does
know
what
you
want
of
him
with
your
foul
temper
and
your
pole
going
like
a
windmill
about
his
ears
the
cursing
and
jerking
ceased
and
a
red
furious
face
with
thick
black
beard
and
hair
looked
up
but
before
the
rider
could
speak
mary
went
on
again
there
now
chris
he
is
as
quiet
as
a
sheep
again
now
take
him
at
it
what
does
he
want
asked
anthony
i
can
scarcely
see
for
the
dust
why
he
practising
at
the
quintain
ah
ah
she
cried
out
again
as
the
quintain
was
missed
and
swung
round
with
a
hard
buffet
on
the
back
as
he
tore
past
going
to
market
chris
you
got
a
sturdy
shepherd
behind
you
baa
baa
black
sheep
who
that
asked
anthony
as
the
tall
horseman
as
if
driven
by
the
storm
of
contumely
from
the
window
disappeared
towards
the
stable
why
that
chris
hatton
whom
the
queen
calls
her
sheep
and
he
as
silly
as
one
too
with
his
fool
face
and
his
bleat
and
his
great
eyes
he
trots
about
after
her
grace
too
like
a
pet
lamb
bah
i
sick
of
him
that
enough
of
the
ass
tell
me
about
isabel
then
they
fell
to
talking
about
isabel
and
mary
eyed
him
as
he
answered
her
questions
then
she
is
a
papist
yet
she
asked
anthony
face
showed
such
consternation
that
she
burst
out
laughing
there
there
there
she
cried
no
harm
done
then
that
tall
lad
who
was
away
last
time
i
was
there
well
i
suppose
he
not
turned
protestant
anthony
face
was
still
more
bewildered
why
my
dear
lad
she
said
where
are
your
eyes
mistress
corbet
he
burst
out
at
last
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
hubert
has
been
in
durham
for
years
there
is
no
talk
and
he
stopped
mary
face
became
sedate
again
well
well
she
said
i
always
was
a
tattler
it
seems
i
am
wrong
again
forgive
me
master
anthony
anthony
was
indeed
astonished
at
her
fantastic
idea
of
course
he
knew
that
hubert
had
once
been
fond
of
isabel
but
that
was
years
ago
when
they
had
been
all
children
together
why
he
reflected
he
too
had
been
foolish
once
and
he
blushed
a
little
then
they
went
on
to
talk
of
great
keynes
sir
nicholas
and
stewart
arrest
and
death
and
mary
asked
anthony
to
excuse
her
interest
in
such
matters
but
papistry
had
always
been
her
religion
and
what
could
a
poor
girl
do
but
believe
what
she
was
taught
then
they
went
on
to
speak
of
more
recent
affairs
and
mary
made
him
describe
to
her
his
life
at
lambeth
and
everything
he
did
from
the
moment
he
got
up
to
the
moment
he
went
to
bed
again
and
whether
the
archbishop
was
a
kind
master
and
how
long
they
spent
at
prayers
and
how
many
courses
they
had
at
dinner
and
anthony
grew
more
and
more
animated
and
confidential
she
was
so
friendly
and
interested
and
pretty
as
she
leaned
towards
him
and
questioned
and
listened
and
the
faint
scent
of
violet
from
her
dress
awakened
his
old
memories
of
her
and
then
at
last
she
approached
the
subject
on
which
she
had
chiefly
wished
to
see
him
which
was
that
he
should
speak
to
the
steward
at
lambeth
on
behalf
of
a
young
man
who
was
to
be
dismissed
it
seemed
from
the
archbishop
service
because
his
sister
had
lately
turned
papist
and
fled
to
a
convent
abroad
it
was
a
small
matter
and
anthony
readily
promised
to
do
his
best
and
if
necessary
to
approach
the
archbishop
himself
and
mistress
corbet
was
profusely
grateful
they
had
hardly
done
talking
of
the
matter
when
a
trumpet
blew
suddenly
somewhere
away
behind
the
building
they
were
in
mary
held
up
a
white
finger
and
put
her
head
on
one
side
that
will
be
the
ambassador
she
said
anthony
looked
at
her
interrogatively
why
you
country
lad
she
said
come
and
see
she
jumped
up
and
he
followed
her
down
the
gallery
and
along
through
interminable
corridors
and
and
up
and
down
the
stairs
of
this
enormous
palace
and
anthony
grew
bewildered
and
astonished
as
he
went
at
the
doors
on
all
sides
and
the
roofs
that
ranged
themselves
every
way
as
he
looked
out
and
at
last
mary
stopped
at
a
window
and
pointed
out
the
courtyard
beneath
was
alive
with
colour
and
movement
in
front
of
the
entrance
opposite
waited
the
great
gilded
state
carriage
and
another
was
just
driving
away
on
one
side
a
dozen
ladies
on
grey
horses
were
drawn
up
to
follow
behind
the
queen
when
she
should
come
out
and
a
double
row
of
liveried
servants
were
standing
round
the
empty
carriage
the
rest
of
the
court
was
filled
with
spanish
and
english
nobles
mounted
with
their
servants
on
foot
all
alike
in
splendid
costumes
the
spaniards
with
rich
chains
about
their
necks
and
tall
hats
decked
with
stones
and
pearls
and
the
englishmen
in
feathered
buckled
caps
and
short
cloaks
thrown
back
two
or
three
trumpeters
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
anthony
did
not
see
much
state
at
lambeth
and
the
splendour
and
gaiety
of
this
seething
courtyard
exhilarated
him
and
he
stared
down
at
it
all
fascinated
while
mary
corbet
poured
out
a
caustic
commentary
there
is
the
fat
fool
chris
again
all
red
with
his
tilting
i
would
like
to
baa
at
him
again
but
i
dare
not
with
all
these
foreign
folk
there
is
leicester
that
tall
man
with
a
bald
forehead
in
the
cap
with
the
red
feather
on
the
white
horse
behind
the
carriage
he
always
keeps
close
to
the
queen
he
is
the
enemy
of
your
prelate
master
anthony
you
know
that
is
oxford
just
behind
him
on
the
chestnut
yes
look
well
at
him
he
is
the
prince
of
the
none
can
stand
against
him
you
would
say
he
was
at
his
when
he
rides
against
them
all
and
he
can
do
more
than
tilt
these
gloves
and
she
flapped
an
embroidered
pair
before
anthony
these
he
brought
to
england
god
bless
and
reward
him
for
it
she
added
fervently
i
do
not
see
burghley
eh
but
he
is
old
and
gouty
these
days
and
loves
a
cushion
and
a
chair
and
a
bit
of
flannel
better
than
to
kneel
before
her
grace
you
know
she
allows
him
to
sit
when
he
confers
with
her
but
then
she
is
ever
prone
to
show
mercy
to
bearded
persons
ah
there
is
dear
sidney
that
is
a
sweet
soul
but
what
does
he
do
here
among
the
stones
and
mortar
when
he
has
the
beeches
of
penshurst
to
walk
beneath
he
is
not
so
wise
as
i
thought
him
but
i
must
say
i
grow
weary
of
his
nymphs
and
his
airs
of
olympus
and
for
myself
i
do
not
see
that
flora
and
phoebus
and
maia
and
the
rest
are
a
great
gain
instead
of
our
lady
and
saint
christopher
and
the
court
of
heaven
but
then
i
am
a
papist
and
not
a
heathen
and
therefore
blind
and
superstitious
is
that
not
so
master
anthony
and
there
is
maitland
beside
him
with
the
black
velvet
cap
and
the
white
feather
and
his
cross
eyes
and
mouth
now
i
wish
he
were
at
penshurst
or
bath
or
better
still
at
jericho
for
it
is
further
off
i
can
not
bear
that
fellow
why
sussex
is
going
on
the
water
too
i
see
now
what
brings
him
here
i
should
have
thought
his
affairs
gave
him
enough
to
think
of
there
he
is
with
his
groom
behind
him
on
the
other
chestnut
i
am
astonished
at
him
he
is
all
for
this
french
marriage
you
know
so
you
may
figure
to
yourself
mendoza
love
for
him
they
will
be
like
two
cats
together
on
the
barge
spitting
and
snarling
softly
at
one
another
her
grace
loves
to
balance
folk
like
that
first
one
stretches
his
claws
and
then
the
other
then
one
arches
his
back
and
snarls
and
the
other
scratches
his
face
for
him
and
then
when
all
is
flying
fur
and
blasphemy
off
slips
her
grace
and
does
what
she
will
it
was
an
astonishing
experience
for
anthony
he
had
stepped
out
from
his
workaday
life
among
the
grooms
and
officers
and
occasional
glimpses
of
his
lonely
old
master
into
an
enchanted
region
where
great
personages
whose
very
names
were
luminous
with
fame
now
lived
and
breathed
and
looked
cheerful
or
sullen
before
his
very
eyes
and
one
who
knew
them
in
their
daily
life
stood
by
him
and
commented
and
interpreted
them
for
him
he
listened
and
stared
dazed
with
the
strangeness
of
it
all
mistress
corbet
was
proceeding
to
express
her
views
upon
the
foreign
element
that
formed
half
the
pageant
when
the
shrill
music
broke
out
again
in
the
palace
and
the
trumpeters
on
the
steps
took
it
up
and
a
stir
and
bustle
began
then
out
of
the
porch
began
to
stream
a
procession
like
a
river
of
colour
and
jewels
pouring
from
the
foot
of
the
carved
and
windowed
wall
and
eddying
in
a
tumbled
pool
about
the
great
gilt
carriage
ushers
and
footmen
and
nobles
and
ladies
and
pages
in
bewildering
succession
anthony
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
glass
as
he
watched
with
little
exclamations
and
mary
watched
him
amused
and
interested
by
his
enthusiasm
and
last
moved
the
great
canopy
bending
and
swaying
under
the
doorway
and
beneath
it
like
two
gorgeous
butterflies
at
the
sight
of
whom
all
the
standing
world
fell
on
its
knees
came
the
pale
elizabeth
with
her
auburn
hair
and
the
mendoza
side
by
side
and
entered
the
carriage
with
the
five
plumes
atop
and
the
caparisoned
horses
that
stamped
and
tossed
their
jingling
heads
the
yard
was
already
emptying
fast
for
chelsea
stairs
and
as
soon
as
the
two
were
seated
the
shrill
trumpets
blew
again
and
the
halberdiers
moved
off
with
the
carriage
in
the
midst
the
great
nobles
going
before
and
the
ladies
behind
the
later
comers
mounted
as
quickly
as
possible
as
their
horses
were
brought
in
from
the
stable
entrance
and
clattered
away
and
in
five
minutes
the
yard
was
empty
except
for
a
few
sentries
at
their
posts
and
a
servant
or
two
lounging
at
the
doorway
and
as
anthony
still
stared
at
the
empty
pavement
and
the
carpeted
steps
far
away
from
the
direction
of
the
abbey
came
the
clear
call
of
the
horns
to
tell
the
loyal
folk
that
the
queen
was
coming
it
was
a
great
inspiration
for
anthony
he
had
seen
incarnate
below
him
in
the
glittering
rustling
figure
of
the
queen
and
the
courtly
ambassador
in
his
orders
and
jewels
at
her
side
there
they
had
sat
together
in
one
carriage
the
huge
fiery
realm
of
the
south
whose
very
name
was
redolent
with
passion
and
adventure
and
boundless
wealth
and
the
little
northern
kingdom
now
beginning
to
stretch
its
hands
and
quiver
all
along
its
tingling
sinews
and
veins
with
fresh
adolescent
life
and
anthony
knew
that
he
was
one
of
the
cells
of
this
young
organism
and
that
in
him
as
well
as
in
elizabeth
and
this
sparkling
creature
at
his
side
ran
the
fresh
red
blood
of
england
they
were
all
one
in
the
possession
of
a
common
life
and
his
heart
burned
as
he
thought
of
it
after
he
had
parted
from
mary
he
rode
back
to
westminster
and
crossed
the
river
by
the
that
plied
there
and
even
as
he
landed
and
got
his
beast
with
a
deal
of
stamping
and
blowing
off
the
echoing
boards
on
to
the
clean
gravel
again
there
came
down
the
reaches
of
the
river
the
mellow
sound
of
music
across
a
mile
of
water
mingled
with
the
deep
rattle
of
oars
and
sparkles
of
steel
and
colour
glittered
from
the
royal
barges
in
the
autumn
sunshine
and
the
lad
thought
with
wonder
how
the
two
great
powers
so
savagely
at
war
upon
the
salt
sea
were
at
peace
here
sitting
side
by
side
on
silken
cushions
and
listening
to
the
same
trumpets
of
peace
upon
the
flowing
river
chapter
ii
some
new
lessons
the
six
years
that
followed
sir
nicholas
return
and
hubert
departure
for
the
north
had
passed
uneventfully
at
great
keynes
the
old
knight
had
been
profoundly
shocked
that
any
catholic
especially
an
agent
so
valuable
as
stewart
should
have
found
his
house
a
and
although
he
continued
receiving
his
friends
and
succouring
them
he
did
so
with
more
real
caution
and
less
ostentation
of
it
his
religious
zeal
and
discretion
were
further
increased
by
the
secret
return
to
the
old
religion
of
several
of
his
villagers
during
the
period
and
a
very
fair
congregation
attended
mass
so
often
as
it
was
said
in
the
cloister
wing
of
the
hall
the
new
rector
like
his
predecessor
was
content
to
let
the
squire
alone
and
unlike
him
had
no
wife
to
make
trouble
then
suddenly
in
the
summer
of
catastrophes
began
headed
by
the
unexpected
return
of
hubert
impatient
of
waiting
and
with
new
plans
in
his
mind
isabel
had
been
out
with
mistress
margaret
walking
in
the
dusk
one
august
evening
after
supper
on
the
raised
terrace
beneath
the
yews
they
had
been
listening
to
the
loud
snoring
of
the
young
owls
in
the
ivy
on
the
opposite
and
had
watched
the
fierce
bird
slide
silently
out
of
the
gloom
white
against
the
blackness
and
disappear
down
among
the
meadows
once
isabel
had
seen
him
pause
too
on
one
of
his
return
journeys
suspicious
of
the
dim
figures
beneath
silhouetted
on
a
branch
against
the
luminous
green
western
sky
with
the
outline
of
a
mouse
with
its
hanging
tail
plain
in
his
crooked
claws
before
he
glided
to
his
nest
again
as
isabel
waited
she
heard
the
bang
of
the
but
gave
it
no
thought
and
a
moment
after
mistress
margaret
asked
her
to
fetch
a
couple
of
wraps
from
the
house
for
them
both
as
the
air
had
a
touch
of
chill
in
it
she
came
down
the
lichened
steps
crossed
the
lawn
and
passed
into
the
unlighted
hall
as
she
entered
the
door
opposite
opened
and
for
a
moment
she
saw
the
silhouette
of
a
man
figure
against
the
bright
passage
beyond
her
heart
suddenly
leapt
and
stood
still
anthony
she
whispered
in
a
hush
of
suspense
there
was
a
vibration
and
a
step
beside
her
isabel
said
hubert
voice
and
then
his
arms
closed
round
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
struggled
and
panted
a
moment
as
she
felt
his
breath
on
her
face
and
he
released
her
she
recoiled
to
the
door
and
stood
there
silent
and
panting
oh
isabel
he
whispered
and
again
isabel
she
put
out
her
hand
and
grasped
the
behind
her
oh
hubert
why
have
you
come
he
came
a
step
nearer
and
she
could
see
the
faint
whiteness
of
his
face
in
the
western
glimmer
i
can
not
wait
he
said
i
have
been
nearly
beside
myself
i
have
left
the
north
and
i
can
not
wait
so
long
well
she
said
and
he
heard
the
note
of
entreaty
and
anxiety
in
her
voice
i
have
my
plans
he
answered
i
will
tell
you
where
is
my
aunt
isabel
heard
a
step
on
the
gravel
outside
she
is
coming
she
said
sharply
hubert
melted
into
the
dark
and
she
saw
the
opposite
door
open
and
let
him
out
the
next
day
hubert
announced
his
plans
to
sir
nicholas
and
a
conflict
followed
i
can
not
go
on
sir
he
said
i
can
not
wait
for
ever
i
am
treated
like
a
servant
too
and
you
know
how
miserably
i
am
paid
i
have
obeyed
you
for
six
years
sir
and
now
i
have
thrown
up
the
post
and
told
my
lord
to
his
face
that
i
can
bear
with
him
no
longer
sir
nicholas
face
as
he
sat
in
his
upright
chair
opposite
the
boy
grew
flushed
with
passion
it
is
your
accursed
temper
sir
he
said
violently
i
know
you
of
old
wait
for
what
for
the
protestant
girl
i
told
you
to
put
that
from
your
mind
sir
hubert
did
not
propose
as
yet
to
let
his
father
into
all
his
plans
i
have
not
spoken
her
name
sir
i
think
i
say
i
can
not
wait
for
my
fortune
i
may
be
impatient
sir
i
do
not
deny
it
then
how
do
you
propose
to
better
it
sneered
his
father
in
november
said
hubert
steadily
looking
his
father
in
the
eyes
i
sail
with
mr
drake
sir
nicholas
face
grew
terrific
he
rose
and
struck
the
table
twice
with
his
clenched
fist
then
by
god
sir
drake
may
have
you
now
hubert
face
grew
white
with
anger
but
he
had
his
temper
under
control
then
i
wish
you
sir
and
he
left
the
room
when
the
boy
had
left
the
house
again
for
london
as
he
did
the
same
afternoon
lady
maxwell
tried
to
soothe
the
old
man
it
was
impossible
even
for
her
to
approach
him
before
sweetheart
she
said
tranquilly
as
he
sat
and
glowered
at
his
plate
when
supper
was
over
and
the
men
had
left
the
room
sweetheart
we
must
have
hubert
down
here
again
he
must
not
sail
with
mr
drake
the
old
man
face
flared
up
again
in
anger
he
may
follow
his
own
devices
he
cried
i
care
not
what
he
does
he
has
given
up
the
post
that
i
asked
for
him
and
he
comes
striding
and
ruffling
home
with
his
hat
cocked
and
and
his
voice
became
inarticulate
he
is
only
a
boy
sweetheart
with
a
boy
hot
blood
you
would
sooner
have
him
like
that
than
a
besides
he
is
our
boy
the
old
man
growled
his
wife
went
on
and
now
that
james
can
not
have
the
estate
he
must
have
it
as
you
know
and
carry
on
the
old
name
he
has
disgraced
it
burst
out
the
angry
old
man
and
he
is
going
now
with
that
damned
protestant
to
harry
catholics
by
the
grace
of
god
i
love
my
country
and
would
serve
her
grace
with
my
heart
blood
but
that
my
boy
should
go
with
drake
and
again
his
voice
failed
it
was
a
couple
of
days
before
she
could
obtain
her
husband
leave
to
write
a
conciliatory
letter
giving
leave
to
hubert
to
go
with
drake
if
he
had
made
any
positive
engagement
because
as
she
represented
to
sir
nicholas
there
was
nothing
actually
wrong
or
disloyal
to
the
faith
in
it
but
entreating
him
with
much
pathos
not
to
leave
his
old
parents
so
bitterly
oh
my
dear
son
the
end
of
the
letter
ran
your
father
is
old
and
god
in
whose
hand
are
our
days
alone
knows
how
long
he
will
live
and
i
too
my
son
am
old
so
come
back
to
us
and
be
our
dear
child
again
you
must
not
think
too
hardly
of
your
father
words
to
you
he
is
quick
and
hot
as
you
are
too
but
indeed
we
love
you
dearly
your
room
here
is
ready
for
you
and
piers
wants
a
firm
hand
now
over
him
as
your
father
is
so
old
so
come
back
my
darling
and
make
our
old
hearts
glad
again
but
the
weeks
passed
by
and
no
answer
came
and
the
old
people
hearts
grew
sick
with
suspense
and
then
at
last
in
september
the
courier
brought
a
letter
written
from
plymouth
which
told
the
mother
that
it
was
too
late
that
he
had
in
fact
engaged
himself
to
drake
in
august
before
he
had
come
to
great
keynes
at
all
and
that
in
honour
he
must
keep
his
engagement
he
asked
pardon
of
his
father
for
his
hastiness
but
it
seemed
a
cold
and
sorrow
and
the
letter
ended
by
announcing
that
the
little
fleet
would
sail
in
november
and
that
at
present
they
were
busy
fitting
the
ships
and
engaging
the
men
and
that
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
him
to
return
to
wish
them
before
he
sailed
it
was
plain
that
the
lad
was
angry
still
sir
nicholas
did
not
say
much
but
a
silence
fell
on
the
house
lady
maxwell
sent
for
isabel
and
they
had
a
long
interview
the
old
lady
was
astonished
at
the
girl
quietness
and
resignation
yes
she
said
she
loved
hubert
with
all
her
heart
she
had
loved
him
for
a
long
while
no
she
was
not
angry
only
startled
what
would
she
do
about
the
difference
in
religion
could
she
marry
him
while
one
was
a
catholic
and
the
other
a
protestant
no
they
would
never
be
happy
like
that
and
she
did
not
know
what
she
would
do
she
supposed
she
would
wait
and
see
yes
she
would
wait
and
see
that
was
all
that
could
be
and
then
had
come
a
silent
burst
of
tears
and
the
girl
had
sunk
down
on
her
knees
and
hidden
her
face
in
the
old
lady
lap
and
the
wrinkled
jewelled
old
hand
passed
quietly
over
the
girl
black
hair
but
no
more
had
been
said
and
isabel
presently
got
up
and
went
home
to
the
dower
house
the
autumn
went
by
and
november
came
and
there
was
no
further
word
from
hubert
then
towards
the
end
of
november
a
report
reached
them
from
anthony
at
lambeth
that
the
fleet
had
sailed
but
had
put
back
into
falmouth
after
a
terrible
storm
in
the
channel
and
hope
just
raised
its
head
then
one
evening
after
supper
sir
nicholas
complained
of
fever
and
restlessness
and
went
early
to
bed
in
the
night
he
was
delirious
mistress
margaret
hastened
up
at
midnight
from
the
dower
house
and
a
groom
galloped
off
to
lindfield
before
morning
to
fetch
the
doctor
and
another
to
fetch
barnes
the
priest
from
cuckfield
sir
nicholas
was
bled
to
reduce
the
fever
of
the
pneumonia
that
had
attacked
him
all
day
long
he
was
sinking
about
eleven
that
night
he
fell
asleep
apparently
and
lady
maxwell
who
had
watched
incessantly
was
persuaded
to
lie
down
but
at
three
in
the
morning
on
the
first
of
december
mistress
margaret
awakened
her
and
together
they
knelt
by
the
bedside
of
the
old
man
the
priest
who
had
anointed
him
on
the
previous
evening
knelt
behind
repeating
the
prayers
for
the
dying
sir
nicholas
lay
on
his
back
supported
by
pillows
under
the
gloom
of
the
black
old
bed
a
glowed
on
the
hearth
and
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
the
burning
a
crucifix
was
in
the
old
man
hands
but
his
eyes
were
bright
with
fever
and
his
fingers
every
now
and
then
relaxed
and
then
tightened
their
hold
again
on
the
cool
silver
of
the
figure
of
the
crucified
saviour
his
lips
were
moving
tremulously
and
his
ruddy
old
face
was
pale
now
the
priest
voice
went
on
steadily
the
struggle
was
beginning
anima
christiana
de
hoc
go
forth
christian
soul
from
this
world
in
the
name
of
god
the
father
almighty
who
created
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
son
of
the
living
god
who
suffered
for
thee
in
the
name
of
the
holy
ghost
who
was
shed
forth
upon
thee
in
the
name
of
angels
and
archangels
in
the
name
of
thrones
and
dominions
in
the
name
of
principalities
and
powers
suddenly
the
old
man
whose
head
had
been
slowly
turning
from
side
to
side
ceased
his
movement
and
his
open
mouth
closed
he
was
looking
steadily
at
his
wife
and
a
look
of
recognition
came
back
to
his
eyes
sweetheart
he
said
and
smiled
and
died
isabel
did
not
see
much
of
mistress
margaret
for
the
next
few
days
she
was
constantly
with
her
sister
and
when
she
came
to
the
dower
house
now
and
then
said
little
to
the
girl
there
were
curious
rumours
in
the
village
strangers
came
and
went
continually
and
there
was
a
vast
congregation
at
the
funeral
when
the
body
of
the
old
knight
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
maxwell
chapel
the
following
day
the
air
of
mystery
deepened
and
young
melton
whispered
to
isabel
with
many
glances
and
becks
that
she
and
her
man
had
seen
lights
through
the
chapel
windows
at
three
that
morning
isabel
went
into
the
chapel
presently
to
visit
the
grave
and
there
was
a
new
smear
of
black
on
the
east
wall
as
if
a
taper
had
been
set
too
near
the
courier
who
had
been
despatched
to
announce
to
hubert
that
his
father
had
died
and
left
him
master
of
the
hall
and
estate
with
certain
conditions
returned
at
the
end
of
the
month
with
the
news
that
the
fleet
had
sailed
again
on
the
thirteenth
and
that
hubert
was
gone
with
it
so
lady
maxwell
now
more
silent
and
retired
than
ever
for
the
present
retained
her
old
position
and
piers
took
charge
of
the
estate
although
isabel
outwardly
was
very
little
changed
in
the
last
six
years
great
movements
had
been
taking
place
in
her
soul
and
if
hubert
had
only
known
the
state
of
the
case
possibly
he
would
not
have
gone
so
hastily
with
drake
the
close
companionship
of
such
an
one
as
mistress
margaret
was
doing
its
almost
inevitable
work
and
the
girl
had
been
learning
that
behind
the
brilliant
and
even
crude
surface
of
the
catholic
practice
there
lay
still
and
beautiful
depths
of
devotion
which
she
had
scarcely
dreamed
of
the
old
nun
life
was
a
revelation
to
isabel
she
heard
from
her
bed
in
the
black
winter
mornings
her
footsteps
in
the
next
room
and
soon
learnt
that
mistress
margaret
spent
at
least
two
hours
in
prayer
before
she
appeared
at
all
two
or
three
times
in
the
day
she
knew
that
she
retired
again
for
the
same
purpose
and
again
an
hour
after
she
was
in
bed
there
were
the
same
gentle
movements
next
door
she
began
to
discover
too
that
for
the
catholic
as
well
as
for
the
puritan
the
person
of
the
saviour
was
the
very
heart
of
religion
that
her
own
devotion
to
christ
was
a
very
languid
flame
by
the
side
of
the
ardent
inarticulate
passion
of
this
soul
who
believed
herself
his
wedded
spouse
and
that
the
worship
of
the
saints
and
the
blessed
mother
instead
of
distracting
the
love
of
the
christian
soul
rather
seemed
to
augment
it
the
king
of
love
stood
as
she
fancied
sometimes
to
catholic
eyes
in
a
glow
of
ineffable
splendour
and
the
faces
of
his
adoring
court
reflected
the
ruddy
glory
on
all
sides
thus
refracting
the
light
of
their
central
sun
instead
of
as
she
had
thought
obscuring
it
other
difficulties
too
began
to
seem
oddly
unreal
and
intangible
when
she
had
looked
at
them
in
the
light
of
mistress
margaret
clear
old
eyes
and
candid
face
it
was
a
real
event
in
her
inner
life
when
she
first
began
to
understand
what
the
rosary
meant
to
catholics
mistress
corbet
had
told
her
what
was
the
actual
use
of
the
beads
and
how
the
mysteries
of
christ
life
and
death
were
to
be
pondered
over
as
the
various
prayers
were
said
but
it
had
hitherto
seemed
to
isabel
as
if
this
method
were
an
elaborate
and
superstitious
substitute
for
reading
the
inspired
record
of
the
new
testament
she
had
been
sitting
out
in
the
little
walled
garden
in
front
of
the
dower
house
one
morning
on
an
early
summer
day
after
her
father
death
and
mistress
margaret
had
come
out
in
her
black
dress
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
irresolutely
framed
in
the
dark
doorway
then
she
had
come
slowly
across
the
grass
and
isabel
had
seen
for
the
first
time
in
her
fingers
a
string
of
ivory
beads
mistress
margaret
sat
down
on
a
garden
chair
a
little
way
from
her
and
let
her
hands
sink
into
her
lap
still
holding
the
beads
isabel
said
nothing
but
went
on
reading
presently
she
looked
up
again
and
the
old
lady
eyes
were
and
her
lips
just
moving
and
the
beads
passing
slowly
through
her
fingers
she
looked
almost
like
a
child
dreaming
in
spite
of
her
wrinkles
and
her
snowy
hair
the
pale
light
of
a
serene
soul
lay
on
her
face
this
did
not
look
like
the
mechanical
performance
that
isabel
had
always
associated
with
the
idea
of
beads
so
the
minutes
passed
away
every
time
that
isabel
looked
up
there
was
the
little
white
face
with
the
long
lashes
lying
on
the
cheek
and
the
crown
of
snowy
hair
and
lace
and
the
luminous
look
of
a
soul
in
conscious
communion
with
the
unseen
when
the
old
lady
had
finished
she
twisted
the
beads
about
her
fingers
and
opened
her
eyes
isabel
had
an
impulse
to
speak
mistress
margaret
she
said
may
i
ask
you
something
of
course
my
darling
the
old
lady
said
i
have
never
seen
you
use
those
before
i
can
not
understand
them
what
is
it
asked
the
old
lady
that
you
do
understand
how
can
prayers
said
over
and
over
again
like
that
be
any
good
mistress
margaret
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
saw
young
martin
last
week
she
said
with
her
little
girl
in
her
lap
amy
had
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
and
was
being
rocked
to
and
fro
and
every
time
she
rocked
she
said
mother
but
then
said
isabel
after
a
moment
silence
she
was
only
a
child
ye
become
like
little
children
quoted
mistress
margaret
softly
you
see
my
isabel
we
are
nothing
more
than
children
with
god
and
his
blessed
mother
to
say
mary
hail
mary
is
the
best
way
of
telling
her
how
much
we
love
her
and
then
this
string
of
beads
is
like
our
lady
girdle
and
her
children
love
to
finger
it
and
whisper
to
her
and
then
we
say
our
paternosters
too
and
all
the
while
we
are
talking
she
is
shewing
us
pictures
of
her
dear
child
and
we
look
at
all
the
great
things
he
did
for
us
one
by
one
and
then
we
turn
the
page
and
begin
again
i
see
said
isabel
and
after
a
moment
or
two
silence
mistress
margaret
got
up
and
went
into
the
house
the
girl
sat
still
with
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knee
how
strange
and
different
this
religion
was
to
the
fiery
gospel
she
had
heard
last
year
at
northampton
from
the
harsh
stern
preacher
at
whose
voice
a
veil
seemed
to
rend
and
show
a
heaven
behind
how
tender
and
simple
this
was
like
a
blue
summer
sky
with
drifting
clouds
if
only
it
was
true
if
only
there
were
a
great
mother
whose
girdle
was
of
beads
strung
together
which
dangled
into
every
christian
hands
whose
face
bent
down
over
every
christian
bed
and
whose
mighty
and
tender
arms
that
had
held
her
son
and
god
were
still
stretched
out
beneath
her
other
children
and
isabel
whose
soul
yearned
for
a
mother
sighed
as
she
reminded
herself
that
there
was
but
one
mediator
between
god
and
man
the
man
christ
jesus
and
so
the
time
went
by
like
an
outgoing
tide
silent
and
steady
the
old
nun
did
not
talk
much
to
the
girl
about
dogmatic
religion
for
she
was
in
a
difficult
position
she
was
timid
certainly
of
betraying
her
faith
by
silence
but
she
was
also
timid
of
betraying
her
trust
by
speech
sometimes
she
felt
she
had
gone
too
far
sometimes
not
far
enough
but
on
the
whole
her
practice
was
never
to
suggest
questions
but
only
to
answer
them
when
isabel
asked
and
to
occupy
herself
with
affirmative
rather
than
with
destructive
criticism
more
than
this
she
hesitated
to
do
out
of
honour
for
the
dead
less
than
this
she
dared
not
do
out
of
love
for
god
and
isabel
but
there
were
three
or
four
conversations
that
she
felt
were
worth
waiting
for
and
the
look
on
isabel
face
afterwards
and
the
sudden
questions
she
would
ask
sometimes
after
a
fit
of
silence
made
her
friend
heart
quicken
towards
her
and
her
prayers
more
fervent
the
two
were
sitting
together
one
december
day
in
isabel
upstairs
room
and
the
girl
who
had
just
come
in
from
a
solitary
walk
was
half
kneeling
on
the
and
drumming
her
fingers
softly
on
the
panes
as
she
looked
out
at
the
red
western
sky
i
used
to
think
she
said
that
catholics
had
no
spiritual
life
but
now
it
seems
to
me
that
in
comparison
we
puritans
have
none
you
know
so
much
about
the
soul
as
to
what
is
from
god
and
what
from
the
evil
one
and
we
have
to
grope
for
ourselves
and
yet
our
saviour
said
that
his
sheep
should
know
his
voice
i
do
not
understand
it
and
she
turned
towards
mistress
margaret
who
had
laid
down
her
work
and
was
listening
dear
child
she
said
if
you
mean
our
priests
and
spiritual
writers
it
is
because
they
study
it
we
believe
in
the
science
of
the
soul
and
we
consult
our
spiritual
guides
for
our
soul
health
as
the
leech
for
our
body
health
but
why
must
you
ask
the
priest
if
the
lord
speaks
to
all
alike
he
speaks
through
the
priest
my
dear
as
he
does
through
the
physician
but
why
should
the
priest
know
better
than
the
people
pursued
isabel
intent
on
her
point
because
he
tells
us
what
the
church
says
said
the
other
smiling
it
is
his
business
he
need
not
be
any
better
or
cleverer
in
other
respects
the
baker
may
be
a
thief
or
a
foolish
fellow
but
his
bread
is
good
but
how
do
you
know
went
on
isabel
who
thought
mistress
margaret
a
little
slow
to
see
her
point
how
do
you
know
that
the
church
is
right
the
old
nun
considered
a
moment
and
then
lifted
her
embroidery
again
why
do
you
think
she
asked
beginning
to
sew
that
each
single
soul
that
asks
god
guidance
is
right
because
the
holy
ghost
is
promised
to
such
said
isabel
wondering
then
is
it
not
likely
went
on
the
other
still
stitching
that
the
millions
of
souls
who
form
holy
church
are
right
when
they
all
agree
together
isabel
moved
a
little
impatiently
you
see
went
on
mistress
margaret
that
is
what
we
catholics
believe
our
saviour
meant
when
he
said
that
the
gates
of
hell
should
not
prevail
against
his
church
but
isabel
was
not
content
she
broke
in
but
why
are
not
the
scriptures
sufficient
they
are
god
word
the
other
put
down
her
embroidery
again
and
smiled
up
into
the
puzzled
eyes
well
my
child
she
said
do
they
seem
sufficient
when
you
look
at
christendom
now
if
they
are
so
clear
how
is
it
that
you
have
the
lutherans
and
the
anabaptists
and
the
family
of
love
and
the
calvinists
and
the
church
of
england
all
saying
they
hold
to
the
scriptures
alone
nay
nay
the
scriptures
are
the
grammar
and
the
church
is
the
dame
that
teaches
out
of
it
and
she
knows
so
well
much
that
is
not
in
the
grammar
and
we
name
that
tradition
but
where
there
is
no
dame
to
teach
the
children
soon
fall
about
the
book
and
the
meaning
of
it
isabel
looked
at
mistress
margaret
a
moment
and
then
turned
back
again
to
the
window
in
silence
at
another
time
they
had
a
word
or
two
about
peter
prerogatives
surely
said
isabel
suddenly
as
they
walked
together
in
the
garden
christ
is
the
one
foundation
of
the
church
paul
tells
us
so
expressly
yes
my
dear
said
the
nun
but
then
christ
our
lord
said
art
peter
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
so
he
who
is
the
only
good
shepherd
said
to
peter
my
sheep
and
he
that
is
and
that
openeth
and
none
shutteth
said
to
him
will
give
thee
the
keys
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
that
is
why
we
call
peter
the
vicar
of
christ
isabel
raised
her
eyebrows
surely
surely
she
began
yes
my
child
said
mistress
margaret
i
know
it
is
new
and
strange
to
you
but
it
was
not
to
your
grandfather
or
his
forbears
to
them
as
to
me
it
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
we
catholics
are
a
simple
folk
we
hold
that
what
our
saviour
said
simply
he
meant
simply
as
we
do
in
the
sacred
mystery
of
his
body
and
blood
to
us
you
know
she
went
on
smiling
with
a
hand
on
the
girl
arm
it
seems
as
if
you
protestants
twisted
the
word
of
god
against
all
justice
isabel
smiled
back
at
her
but
she
was
puzzled
the
point
of
view
was
new
to
her
and
yet
again
in
the
garden
a
few
months
later
as
they
sat
out
together
on
the
lawn
the
girl
opened
the
same
subject
mistress
margaret
she
said
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
and
it
seems
very
plain
when
you
talk
but
you
know
our
great
divines
could
answer
you
though
i
can
not
my
father
was
no
papist
and
grindal
and
the
bishops
are
all
wise
men
how
do
you
answer
that
the
nun
looked
silently
down
at
the
grass
a
moment
or
two
it
is
the
old
tale
she
said
at
last
looking
up
we
can
not
believe
that
the
babes
and
sucklings
are
as
likely
to
be
right
in
such
matters
as
the
wise
and
prudent
even
more
likely
if
our
saviour
words
are
to
be
believed
dear
child
do
you
not
see
that
our
lord
came
to
save
all
men
and
call
all
men
into
his
church
and
that
therefore
he
must
have
marked
his
church
in
such
a
manner
that
the
most
ignorant
may
perceive
it
as
easily
as
the
most
learned
learning
is
very
well
and
it
is
the
gift
of
god
but
salvation
and
grace
can
not
depend
upon
it
it
needs
an
architect
to
understand
why
paul
church
is
strong
and
beautiful
and
what
makes
it
so
but
any
child
or
foolish
fellow
can
see
that
it
is
so
i
do
not
understand
said
isabel
wrinkling
her
forehead
why
this
that
you
are
as
likely
to
know
the
catholic
church
when
you
see
it
as
grindal
or
freake
or
your
dear
father
himself
only
a
divine
can
explain
about
it
and
understand
it
but
you
and
i
are
as
fit
to
see
it
and
walk
into
it
as
any
of
them
but
then
why
are
they
not
all
catholics
asked
isabel
still
bewildered
ah
said
the
nun
softly
god
alone
knows
who
reads
hearts
and
calls
whom
he
will
but
learning
at
least
has
nought
to
do
with
it
conversations
of
this
kind
that
took
place
now
and
then
between
the
two
were
sufficient
to
show
mistress
margaret
like
tiny
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
stream
the
swift
movement
of
this
limpid
soul
that
she
loved
so
well
but
on
the
other
hand
all
the
girl
past
life
and
most
sacred
and
dear
associations
were
in
conflict
with
this
movement
the
memory
of
her
quiet
wise
father
rose
and
reproached
her
sometimes
anthony
enthusiastic
talk
when
he
came
down
from
lambeth
on
the
glorious
destinies
of
the
church
of
england
of
her
gallant
protest
against
the
corruptions
of
the
west
and
of
her
future
unique
position
in
christendom
as
the
national
church
of
the
most
progressive
country
all
this
caused
her
to
shrink
back
terrified
from
the
bourne
to
which
she
was
drifting
and
from
the
breach
that
must
follow
with
her
brother
but
above
all
else
that
caused
her
pain
was
the
shocking
suspicion
that
her
love
for
hubert
perhaps
was
influencing
her
and
that
she
was
living
in
gross
as
to
the
sincerity
of
her
motives
this
culminated
at
last
in
a
scene
that
seriously
startled
the
old
nun
it
took
place
one
summer
night
after
hubert
departure
in
expedition
mistress
margaret
had
seen
isabel
to
her
room
and
an
hour
later
had
finished
her
and
was
thinking
of
preparing
herself
to
bed
when
there
was
a
hurried
tap
at
the
door
and
isabel
came
quickly
in
her
face
pale
and
miserable
her
great
grey
eyes
full
of
trouble
and
distraction
and
her
hair
on
her
shoulders
my
dear
child
said
the
nun
what
is
it
isabel
closed
the
door
and
stood
looking
at
her
with
her
lips
parted
how
can
i
know
mistress
margaret
she
said
in
the
voice
of
a
whether
this
is
the
voice
of
god
or
of
my
own
wicked
self
no
no
she
went
on
as
the
other
came
towards
her
frightened
let
me
tell
you
i
must
speak
yes
my
child
you
shall
but
come
and
sit
down
first
and
she
drew
her
to
a
chair
and
set
her
in
it
and
threw
a
wrap
over
her
knees
and
feet
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
one
of
her
hands
and
held
it
between
her
own
now
then
isabel
what
is
it
i
have
been
thinking
over
it
all
so
long
began
the
girl
in
the
same
tremulous
voice
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
nun
face
and
in
bed
i
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
you
see
i
love
hubert
and
i
used
to
think
i
loved
our
saviour
too
but
now
i
do
not
know
it
seems
as
if
he
was
leading
me
to
the
catholic
church
all
is
so
much
more
plain
and
easy
there
it
seems
it
seems
to
make
sense
in
the
catholic
church
and
all
the
rest
of
us
are
wandering
in
the
dark
but
if
i
become
a
catholic
you
see
i
can
marry
hubert
then
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
that
and
wanting
to
marry
him
but
then
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
that
i
think
i
see
it
all
so
plainly
just
because
i
want
to
see
it
plainly
and
what
am
i
to
do
why
will
not
our
lord
shew
me
my
own
heart
and
what
is
his
will
mistress
margaret
shook
her
head
gently
dear
child
she
said
our
saviour
loves
you
and
wishes
to
make
you
happy
do
you
not
think
that
perhaps
he
is
helping
you
and
making
it
easy
in
this
way
by
drawing
you
to
his
church
through
hubert
why
should
not
both
be
his
will
that
you
should
become
a
catholic
and
marry
hubert
as
well
yes
said
isabel
but
how
can
i
tell
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
went
on
the
old
lady
be
quite
simple
and
quiet
whenever
your
soul
begins
to
be
disturbed
and
anxious
put
yourself
in
his
hands
and
refuse
to
decide
for
yourself
it
is
so
easy
so
easy
but
why
should
i
be
so
anxious
and
disturbed
if
it
were
not
our
lord
speaking
and
warning
me
in
the
catholic
church
said
mistress
margaret
we
know
well
about
all
those
movements
of
the
soul
and
we
call
them
scruples
you
must
resist
them
dear
child
like
temptations
we
are
told
that
if
a
soul
is
in
grace
and
desires
to
serve
god
then
whenever
our
lord
speaks
it
is
to
bring
sweetness
with
him
and
when
it
is
the
evil
one
he
brings
disturbance
and
that
is
why
i
am
sure
that
these
questionings
are
not
from
god
you
feel
stifled
is
it
not
so
when
you
try
to
pray
and
all
seems
empty
of
god
the
waves
and
storms
are
going
over
you
but
lie
still
and
be
content
and
refuse
to
be
disturbed
and
you
will
soon
be
at
peace
again
and
see
the
light
clearly
mistress
margaret
found
herself
speaking
simply
in
short
words
and
sentences
as
to
a
child
she
had
seen
that
for
a
long
while
past
the
clouds
had
been
gathering
over
isabel
and
that
her
soul
was
at
present
completely
overcast
and
unable
to
perceive
or
decide
anything
clearly
and
so
she
gave
her
this
simple
advice
and
did
her
utmost
to
soothe
her
knowing
that
such
a
clean
soul
would
not
be
kept
long
in
the
dark
she
knelt
down
with
isabel
presently
and
prayed
aloud
with
her
in
a
quiet
even
voice
a
patch
of
moonlight
lay
on
the
floor
and
something
of
its
white
serenity
seemed
to
be
in
the
old
nun
tones
as
she
entreated
the
merciful
lord
to
bid
peace
again
to
this
anxious
soul
and
let
her
see
light
again
through
the
dark
and
when
she
had
taken
isabel
back
again
to
her
own
room
at
last
and
had
seen
her
safely
into
bed
and
kissed
her
already
the
face
was
quieter
as
it
lay
on
the
pillow
and
the
lines
were
smoothed
out
of
her
forehead
god
bless
you
said
mistress
margaret
chapter
iii
hubert
return
after
the
sailing
of
drake
expedition
the
friends
of
the
adventurers
had
to
wait
in
patience
for
several
months
before
news
arrived
then
the
under
the
command
of
winter
which
had
been
separated
from
drake
in
a
gale
off
the
coast
of
america
returned
to
england
bringing
the
news
of
doughty
execution
for
desertion
but
of
the
herself
there
was
no
further
news
until
complaints
arrived
from
the
viceroy
of
new
spain
of
drake
ravages
up
the
west
coast
then
silence
again
fell
for
eighteen
months
anthony
had
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
in
which
hubert
had
sailed
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
it
was
with
real
relief
that
after
the
burst
of
joy
in
london
at
the
news
of
her
safe
return
to
plymouth
with
an
incalculable
amount
of
plunder
he
had
word
from
lady
maxwell
that
she
hoped
he
would
come
down
at
once
to
great
keynes
and
help
to
welcome
hubert
home
he
was
not
able
to
go
at
once
for
his
duties
detained
him
but
a
couple
of
days
after
the
hall
had
welcomed
its
new
master
anthony
was
at
the
dower
house
again
with
isabel
he
found
her
extraordinarily
bright
and
vivacious
and
was
delighted
at
the
change
for
he
had
been
troubled
the
last
time
he
had
seen
her
a
few
months
before
at
her
silence
and
listlessness
but
her
face
was
radiant
now
as
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
at
the
door
and
told
him
that
they
were
all
to
go
to
supper
that
night
at
the
hall
and
that
hubert
had
been
keeping
his
best
stories
on
purpose
for
his
return
she
showed
him
when
they
got
up
to
his
room
at
last
little
things
hubert
had
given
her
carved
nuts
a
spanish
coin
or
two
and
an
ingot
of
gold
but
of
which
she
would
say
nothing
but
only
laugh
and
nod
her
head
hubert
too
when
he
saw
him
that
evening
seemed
full
of
the
same
sort
of
happiness
that
shone
out
now
and
again
suddenly
there
he
sat
for
hours
after
supper
that
night
broader
and
more
sunburnt
than
ever
with
his
brilliant
eyes
glancing
round
as
he
talked
and
his
sinewy
man
hand
in
the
delicate
creamy
ruff
making
little
explanatory
movements
and
drawing
a
map
once
or
twice
in
spilled
wine
on
the
polished
oak
the
three
ladies
sat
forward
and
watched
him
breathlessly
or
leaned
back
and
sighed
as
each
tale
ended
and
anthony
found
himself
too
carried
away
with
enthusiasm
again
and
again
as
he
looked
at
this
gallant
in
his
gold
chain
and
satin
and
jewels
and
listened
to
his
stories
it
was
bitter
cold
said
hubert
in
his
strong
voice
telling
them
of
doughty
death
on
the
morning
itself
and
snow
lay
on
the
decks
when
we
rose
fletcher
had
prepared
a
table
in
the
with
a
white
cloth
and
bread
and
wine
and
at
nine
of
the
clock
we
were
all
assembled
where
we
might
see
into
the
cabin
and
fletcher
said
the
communion
service
and
drake
and
doughty
received
the
sacrament
there
at
his
hands
some
of
doughty
men
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
back
their
tears
for
you
know
mother
they
were
good
friends
and
then
when
it
was
done
we
made
two
lines
down
the
deck
to
where
the
block
stood
by
the
and
the
two
came
down
together
and
they
kissed
one
another
there
and
doughty
spoke
to
the
men
and
bade
them
pray
for
the
queen
grace
with
him
and
they
did
and
then
he
and
drake
put
off
their
doublets
and
doughty
knelt
at
the
block
and
said
another
prayer
or
two
and
then
laid
his
head
down
and
he
was
shivering
a
little
with
cold
and
then
when
he
gave
the
sign
drake
and
hubert
brought
the
edge
of
his
hand
down
sharply
and
the
glasses
rang
and
the
ladies
drew
quick
hissing
breaths
and
lady
maxwell
put
her
hand
on
her
son
arm
as
he
looked
round
on
all
their
faces
then
he
told
them
of
the
expedition
up
the
west
coast
and
of
the
towns
they
sacked
and
the
opulent
names
rolled
oddly
off
his
tongue
and
seemed
to
bring
a
whiff
of
southern
scent
into
this
panelled
english
room
valparaiso
tarapaca
and
arica
and
of
the
capture
of
the
off
quibdo
and
of
the
enormous
treasure
they
took
the
great
golden
crucifix
with
emeralds
of
the
size
of
pigeon
eggs
and
the
chests
of
pearls
and
the
tons
of
silver
and
the
wedges
of
pure
gold
from
the
peruvian
galleon
and
of
the
golden
falcon
from
the
chinese
trader
that
they
captured
south
of
guatulco
and
he
described
the
search
up
the
coast
for
the
passage
eastwards
that
never
existed
and
of
drake
superb
resolve
to
return
westwards
instead
by
the
moluccas
and
how
they
stayed
at
ternate
south
of
celebes
and
coasted
along
java
seeking
a
passage
and
found
it
in
the
sunda
straits
and
broke
out
from
the
treacherous
islands
into
the
open
sea
crossed
to
africa
rounded
the
cape
of
good
hope
came
up
the
west
coast
touching
at
sierra
leone
and
so
home
again
along
the
spanish
and
french
coasts
to
plymouth
sound
and
the
pealing
of
plymouth
bells
and
he
broke
out
into
something
very
like
eloquence
when
he
spoke
of
drake
never
was
such
a
captain
he
cried
with
his
little
stiff
beard
and
his
obstinate
eyes
i
have
seen
him
stand
on
the
poop
when
the
arrows
were
like
hail
on
the
deck
with
one
finger
in
the
ring
round
his
neck
so
and
hubert
thrust
a
tanned
finger
into
a
link
of
his
chain
and
lifted
his
chin
just
making
little
signs
to
the
steersman
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
to
bring
the
ship
nearer
to
the
spaniard
as
cool
i
tell
you
as
cool
as
if
he
were
playing
merelles
oh
and
then
when
we
boarded
out
came
his
finger
from
his
ring
and
there
was
none
that
struck
so
true
and
fierce
and
all
in
silence
too
without
an
oath
or
a
cry
or
a
word
except
maybe
to
give
an
order
but
he
was
very
sharp
with
all
that
angered
him
when
we
sighted
the
di
i
ran
into
his
cabin
to
tell
him
of
it
without
saluting
so
full
was
my
head
of
the
chase
and
he
looked
at
me
like
ice
and
then
roared
at
me
to
know
where
my
manners
were
and
bade
me
go
out
and
enter
again
properly
before
he
would
hear
my
news
and
then
i
heard
him
rating
the
man
that
stood
at
his
door
for
letting
me
pass
in
that
state
at
his
dinner
too
which
he
took
alone
there
were
always
trumpets
to
blow
as
when
her
grace
dines
when
he
laughed
it
seemed
as
if
he
did
it
with
a
grave
face
there
was
a
piece
of
grand
fooling
when
we
got
out
from
among
those
weary
indian
islands
where
the
great
crabs
be
and
flies
that
burn
in
the
dark
as
i
told
you
fletcher
the
minister
played
the
coward
one
night
when
we
ran
aground
and
bade
us
think
of
our
sins
and
our
immortal
souls
instead
of
urging
us
to
be
smart
about
the
ship
and
he
did
it
too
not
as
drake
might
do
but
in
such
a
melancholy
voice
as
if
we
were
all
at
our
last
hour
so
when
we
were
free
of
our
trouble
and
out
on
the
main
again
we
were
all
called
by
the
drum
to
the
forecastle
and
there
drake
sat
on
a
as
solemn
as
a
judge
so
that
not
a
man
durst
laugh
with
a
pair
of
pantoufles
in
his
hand
and
fletcher
was
brought
before
him
trying
to
smile
as
if
was
a
jest
for
him
too
between
two
guards
and
there
he
was
arraigned
and
the
witnesses
were
called
and
tom
moore
said
how
he
was
tapped
on
the
shoulder
by
fletcher
as
he
was
getting
a
pick
from
the
hold
and
how
he
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
and
bade
him
think
on
doughty
how
there
was
no
mercy
for
him
when
he
needed
it
and
so
there
would
be
none
for
us
and
then
other
witnesses
came
and
then
fletcher
tried
to
make
his
defence
saying
how
it
was
the
part
of
a
minister
to
bid
men
think
on
their
souls
but
no
good
drake
declared
him
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
be
kept
in
irons
till
he
repented
of
that
his
cowardice
and
then
which
was
the
cream
of
the
joke
since
the
prisoner
was
a
minister
drake
declared
him
excommunicate
and
cut
off
from
the
church
of
god
and
given
over
to
the
devil
and
he
was
put
in
irons
too
for
a
while
so
was
not
all
a
joke
and
what
is
drake
doing
now
asked
lady
maxwell
oh
drake
is
in
london
said
hubert
ah
yes
and
you
must
all
come
to
deptford
when
her
grace
is
going
to
be
there
anthony
lad
you
come
anthony
said
he
would
certainly
do
his
best
and
isabel
put
out
her
hand
to
her
brother
and
beamed
at
him
and
then
turned
to
look
at
hubert
again
and
what
are
you
to
do
next
asked
mistress
margaret
well
he
said
i
am
to
go
to
plymouth
again
presently
to
help
to
get
the
treasure
out
of
the
ships
and
i
must
be
there
too
for
the
spring
and
summer
for
drake
wants
me
to
help
him
with
his
new
expedition
but
you
are
not
going
with
him
again
my
son
said
his
mother
quickly
hubert
put
out
his
hand
to
her
no
no
he
said
i
have
written
to
tell
him
i
can
not
i
must
take
my
father
place
here
he
will
understand
and
he
gave
one
swift
glance
at
isabel
and
her
eyes
fell
anthony
was
obliged
to
return
to
lambeth
after
a
day
or
two
and
he
carried
with
him
a
heart
full
of
admiration
and
enthusiasm
for
his
friend
he
had
wondered
once
or
twice
too
as
his
eyes
fell
on
isabel
whether
there
was
anything
in
what
mistress
corbet
had
said
but
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
and
still
less
to
hubert
unless
his
confidence
was
first
sought
the
visit
to
deptford
which
took
place
a
week
or
two
later
gave
an
additional
spurt
to
anthony
nationalism
london
was
all
on
fire
at
the
return
of
the
buccaneers
and
as
anthony
rode
down
the
south
bank
of
the
river
from
lambeth
to
join
the
others
at
the
inn
the
three
miles
of
river
beyond
london
bridge
were
an
inspiriting
sight
in
the
bright
winter
sunshine
crowded
with
craft
of
all
kinds
bright
with
bunting
that
were
making
their
way
down
to
the
naval
triumph
the
road
too
was
thick
with
vehicles
and
pedestrians
it
was
still
early
when
he
met
his
party
at
the
inn
and
hubert
took
them
immediately
to
see
the
that
was
drawn
up
in
a
little
creek
on
the
south
bank
mistress
margaret
had
not
come
so
the
four
went
together
all
over
the
ship
that
had
been
for
these
years
the
perilous
home
of
this
sunburnt
lad
they
all
loved
so
well
hubert
pointed
out
drake
own
cabin
at
the
poop
with
its
where
the
last
sacrament
of
the
two
friends
had
been
celebrated
and
where
drake
himself
had
eaten
in
royal
fashion
to
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
slept
with
sentries
at
his
door
he
showed
them
too
his
own
cabin
where
he
had
lived
with
three
more
officers
and
the
upper
where
drake
would
sit
hour
after
hour
with
his
ranging
the
horizons
for
and
he
showed
them
too
the
high
forecastle
and
the
men
quarters
and
isabel
fingered
delicately
the
of
the
very
guns
that
had
roared
and
snapped
so
fiercely
at
the
dons
and
they
peered
down
into
the
dark
empty
hold
where
the
had
lain
and
up
at
the
three
masts
and
the
rigging
that
had
borne
so
long
the
swift
wings
of
the
and
they
heard
the
hiss
and
rattle
of
the
ropes
as
hubert
ordered
a
man
to
run
up
a
flag
to
show
them
how
it
was
done
and
they
smelled
the
strange
tarry
briny
smell
of
a
ship
you
are
not
tired
anthony
said
to
his
sister
as
they
walked
back
to
the
inn
from
which
they
were
to
see
the
spectacle
she
shook
her
head
happily
and
anthony
looking
at
her
once
more
questioned
himself
whether
mistress
corbet
were
right
or
not
when
they
had
settled
down
at
last
to
their
window
the
crowds
were
gathering
thicker
every
moment
about
the
entrance
to
the
ship
which
lay
in
the
creek
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
from
the
inn
and
on
the
road
along
which
the
queen
was
to
come
from
greenwich
anthony
felt
his
whole
heart
go
out
in
sympathy
to
these
joyous
shouting
folk
beneath
who
were
here
to
celebrate
the
gallant
pluck
of
a
little
bearded
man
and
his
followers
who
for
the
moment
stood
for
england
and
in
whose
presence
just
now
the
queen
herself
must
take
second
place
even
the
quacks
and
salesmen
who
were
busy
in
their
booths
all
round
used
patriotism
to
push
their
bargains
spanish
ointment
spanish
ointment
bellowed
a
herbalist
in
a
doctor
gown
just
below
the
window
the
dons
know
what
best
for
wounds
and
knocks
after
frankie
drake
visit
and
the
crowd
laughed
and
bought
up
his
boxes
and
another
drove
a
roaring
business
in
green
glass
beads
reported
to
be
the
exact
size
of
the
emeralds
taken
from
the
and
others
sold
little
models
of
the
warranted
to
frighten
away
dons
and
all
other
kinds
of
devils
from
the
house
that
possessed
one
isabel
laughed
with
pleasure
and
sent
anthony
down
to
buy
one
for
her
but
perhaps
more
than
all
else
the
sight
of
the
seamen
themselves
stirred
his
heart
most
of
them
officers
as
well
as
men
were
dressed
with
absurd
extravagance
for
the
even
after
the
deduction
of
the
queen
had
been
immense
but
beneath
their
plumed
and
caps
brown
faces
looked
out
alert
and
capable
with
tight
lips
and
bright
puckered
eyes
with
something
of
the
terrier
in
their
expression
there
they
swaggered
along
with
a
slight
roll
in
their
walk
by
ones
or
twos
through
the
crowd
that
formed
lanes
to
let
them
pass
and
surged
along
in
their
wake
shouting
after
them
and
clapping
them
on
the
back
anthony
watched
them
eagerly
as
they
made
their
way
from
all
directions
to
where
the
lay
for
it
was
close
on
noon
then
from
far
away
came
the
boom
of
the
tower
guns
and
then
the
nearer
crash
of
those
that
guarded
the
dockyard
and
last
the
deafening
roar
of
the
broadside
and
then
the
smoke
rose
and
drifted
in
a
heavy
veil
in
the
keen
frosty
air
over
the
cheering
crowds
when
it
lifted
again
there
was
the
flash
of
gold
and
colour
from
the
greenwich
road
and
the
high
braying
of
the
trumpets
pierced
the
roaring
welcome
of
the
people
but
the
watchers
at
the
windows
could
see
no
more
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
than
the
plumes
of
the
royal
carriage
as
the
queen
dismounted
and
a
momentary
glimpse
of
her
figure
and
the
group
round
her
as
she
passed
on
to
the
deck
of
the
and
went
immediately
below
to
the
banquet
while
the
parish
church
bells
pealed
a
welcome
lady
maxwell
insisted
that
isabel
should
now
dine
as
there
would
be
no
more
to
be
seen
till
the
queen
should
come
up
on
deck
again
of
the
actual
ceremony
of
the
knighting
of
drake
they
had
a
very
fair
view
though
the
figures
were
little
and
far
away
the
first
intimation
they
had
that
the
banquet
was
over
was
the
sight
of
the
yeomen
emerging
one
by
one
up
the
little
hatchway
that
led
below
the
halberdiers
lined
the
decks
already
with
their
weapons
flashing
in
long
curved
lines
and
by
the
time
that
the
trumpets
began
to
sound
to
show
that
the
queen
was
on
her
way
from
below
the
decks
were
one
dense
mass
of
colour
and
steel
with
a
lane
left
to
the
foot
of
the
by
which
she
would
ascend
then
at
last
the
two
figures
appeared
the
queen
radiant
in
cloth
of
gold
and
drake
alert
and
brisk
in
his
court
suit
and
sword
there
was
silence
from
the
crowd
as
the
adventurer
knelt
before
the
queen
and
anthony
held
his
breath
with
excitement
as
he
caught
the
flash
of
the
slender
sword
that
an
officer
had
put
into
the
queen
hand
and
then
an
inconceivable
noise
broke
out
as
sir
francis
drake
stood
up
the
crowd
was
one
open
mouth
shouting
the
church
bells
burst
into
peals
overhead
answered
by
the
roll
of
drums
from
the
deck
and
the
blare
of
trumpets
and
then
the
whole
din
sank
into
nothingness
for
a
moment
under
the
crash
of
the
ship
broadside
echoed
instantly
by
the
deeper
roar
of
the
dockyard
guns
and
answered
after
a
moment
or
two
from
far
away
by
the
dull
boom
from
the
tower
and
anthony
leaned
yet
further
from
the
window
and
added
his
voice
to
the
tumult
as
he
rode
back
alone
to
lambeth
after
parting
with
the
others
at
london
bridge
for
they
intended
to
go
down
home
again
that
night
he
was
glowing
with
national
zeal
he
had
seen
not
only
royalty
and
magnificence
but
an
apotheosis
of
character
that
day
there
in
the
little
trim
figure
with
the
curly
hair
kneeling
before
the
queen
was
england
at
its
best
england
that
sent
two
ships
against
an
empire
and
it
was
the
church
that
claimed
sir
francis
drake
as
a
son
and
indeed
a
devoted
one
in
a
sense
that
anthony
himself
was
serving
here
at
lambeth
and
for
which
he
felt
a
real
and
fervent
enthusiasm
he
was
surprised
a
couple
of
days
later
to
receive
a
note
in
lady
maxwell
handwriting
brought
up
by
a
special
messenger
from
the
hall
there
is
a
friend
of
mine
she
wrote
to
come
to
lambeth
house
presently
he
tells
me
to
be
kept
a
day
or
two
in
ward
before
he
is
sent
to
wisbeach
he
is
a
catholic
named
henry
buxton
who
showed
me
great
love
during
the
sorrow
of
my
dear
husband
death
and
i
write
to
you
to
show
kindness
to
him
and
to
get
him
a
good
bed
and
all
that
may
comfort
him
for
i
know
not
whether
lambeth
prison
is
easy
or
hard
but
i
hope
perhaps
that
since
my
lord
archbishop
is
a
prisoner
himself
he
has
pity
on
such
as
are
so
too
and
so
my
pains
be
in
vain
however
if
you
will
see
buxton
at
least
and
have
some
talk
with
him
and
show
him
this
letter
it
will
cheer
him
perhaps
to
see
a
friend
face
anthony
of
course
made
inquiries
at
once
and
found
that
buxton
was
to
arrive
on
the
following
afternoon
it
was
the
custom
to
send
prisoners
occasionally
to
lambeth
more
particularly
those
more
distinguished
or
who
it
was
hoped
could
be
persuaded
to
friendly
conference
buxton
however
was
thought
to
be
incorrigible
and
was
only
sent
there
because
there
was
some
delay
in
the
preparations
for
his
reception
at
wisbeach
which
since
the
previous
year
had
been
used
as
an
overflow
prison
for
papists
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
which
was
friday
anthony
went
straight
out
from
the
hall
after
supper
to
the
gateway
prison
and
found
buxton
at
a
fish
supper
in
the
little
prison
in
the
outer
part
of
the
eastern
tower
he
introduced
himself
but
found
it
necessary
to
show
lady
maxwell
letter
before
the
prisoner
was
satisfied
as
to
his
identity
you
must
pardon
me
norris
he
said
when
he
had
read
the
letter
and
asked
a
question
or
two
but
we
poor
papists
are
bound
to
be
shy
why
in
this
very
room
he
went
on
pointing
to
the
inner
corner
away
from
the
door
and
smiling
for
aught
i
know
a
man
sits
now
to
hear
us
anthony
was
considerably
astonished
to
see
this
stranger
point
so
confidently
to
the
where
indeed
the
warder
used
to
sit
sometimes
behind
a
brick
partition
to
listen
to
the
talk
of
the
prisoners
and
showed
his
surprise
ah
norris
the
other
said
we
papists
are
bound
to
be
well
informed
or
else
where
were
our
lives
but
come
sir
let
us
sit
down
anthony
apologised
for
interrupting
him
at
his
supper
and
offered
to
come
again
but
buxton
begged
him
not
to
leave
as
he
had
nearly
finished
so
anthony
sat
down
and
observed
the
prison
and
the
prisoner
it
was
fairly
well
provided
with
necessaries
a
good
straw
bed
lay
in
one
corner
on
trestles
and
washing
utensils
stood
at
the
further
wall
and
there
was
an
oil
lamp
that
hung
high
up
from
an
iron
pin
the
luggage
lay
still
half
unpacked
on
the
floor
and
a
row
of
pegs
held
a
hat
and
a
cloak
buxton
himself
was
a
man
with
a
short
beard
and
merry
bright
eyes
and
was
dressed
soberly
as
a
gentleman
and
behaved
himself
with
courtesy
and
assurance
but
it
was
a
queer
place
with
this
flickering
lamp
thought
anthony
for
a
gentleman
to
be
eating
his
supper
in
when
buxton
had
finished
his
dish
of
roach
and
a
tankard
of
ale
he
looked
up
at
anthony
smiling
my
lord
knows
the
ways
of
catholics
then
he
said
pointing
to
the
bones
on
his
plate
anthony
explained
that
the
protestants
observed
the
friday
abstinence
too
ah
yes
said
the
other
i
was
forgetting
the
queen
late
injunctions
let
us
see
how
did
it
run
same
is
not
required
for
any
liking
of
papish
superstitions
or
ceremonies
is
it
hitherto
used
which
utterly
are
to
be
detested
of
all
christian
folk
no
the
last
word
or
two
is
a
gloss
only
to
maintain
the
mariners
in
this
land
and
to
set
men
that
is
the
sense
of
it
is
it
not
sir
you
fast
that
is
not
for
heavenly
reasons
which
were
a
foolish
and
papish
thing
to
do
but
for
earthly
reasons
which
is
a
reasonable
and
protestant
thing
to
do
anthony
might
have
taken
this
assault
a
little
amiss
if
he
had
not
seen
a
laughing
light
in
his
companion
eyes
and
remembered
too
that
imprisonment
is
apt
to
breed
a
little
bitterness
so
he
smiled
back
at
him
then
soon
they
fell
to
talking
of
lady
maxwell
and
great
keynes
where
it
seemed
that
buxton
had
stayed
more
than
once
i
knew
sir
nicholas
well
he
said
god
rest
his
soul
it
seems
to
me
he
is
one
of
those
whose
life
continually
gave
the
lie
to
men
who
say
that
a
catholic
can
be
no
true
englishman
there
never
beat
a
more
loyal
heart
than
his
anthony
agreed
but
asked
if
it
were
not
true
that
catholics
were
in
difficulties
sometimes
as
to
the
proper
authority
to
be
obeyed
the
pope
or
the
prince
it
is
true
said
the
other
or
it
might
be
yet
the
principle
is
clear
c√¶sari
quae
sunt
the
difficulty
lies
but
in
the
application
of
the
maxim
but
with
us
said
anthony
church
of
england
folk
there
hardly
can
be
ever
any
such
difficulty
for
the
prince
of
the
state
is
the
governor
of
the
church
as
well
i
take
your
point
said
buxton
you
mean
that
a
national
church
is
better
for
that
spiritual
and
temporal
authorities
are
then
at
one
just
so
said
anthony
beginning
to
warm
to
his
favourite
theme
the
church
is
the
nation
regarded
as
religious
when
england
wars
on
land
it
is
through
her
army
which
is
herself
under
arms
when
on
sea
she
embarks
in
the
navy
and
in
the
warfare
with
spiritual
powers
it
is
through
her
church
and
surely
in
this
way
the
church
must
always
be
the
church
of
the
people
the
englishman
and
the
spaniard
are
like
cat
and
dog
they
like
not
the
same
food
nor
the
same
kind
of
coat
i
hear
that
their
buildings
are
not
like
ours
their
language
nay
their
faces
and
minds
are
not
like
ours
then
why
should
be
their
prayers
and
their
religion
i
quarrel
with
no
foreigner
faith
it
is
god
who
made
us
so
anthony
stopped
breathless
with
his
unusual
eloquence
but
it
was
the
subject
that
lay
nearest
to
his
heart
at
present
and
he
found
no
lack
of
words
the
prisoner
had
watched
him
with
twinkling
eyes
nodding
his
head
as
if
in
agreement
and
when
he
had
finished
his
little
speech
nodded
again
in
meditative
silence
it
is
complete
he
answered
complete
and
as
a
theory
would
be
convincing
and
i
envy
you
master
norris
for
you
stand
on
the
top
of
the
wave
that
is
what
england
holds
but
my
dear
sir
christ
our
lord
refused
such
a
kingdom
as
that
my
kingdom
he
said
is
not
of
this
world
is
not
that
is
ruled
by
the
world
divisions
and
systems
you
have
described
babel
every
nation
with
its
own
language
but
it
was
to
undo
babel
and
to
build
one
spiritual
city
that
our
saviour
came
down
and
sent
the
holy
ghost
to
make
the
church
at
pentecost
out
of
arabians
and
medes
and
elamites
to
break
down
the
as
the
apostle
tells
us
that
there
be
neither
jew
nor
greek
barbarian
nor
scythian
and
to
establish
one
vast
kingdom
which
for
that
very
reason
we
name
catholic
to
destroy
differences
between
nation
and
nation
by
lifting
each
to
be
of
the
people
of
god
to
pull
down
babel
the
city
of
confusion
and
build
jerusalem
the
city
of
peace
dear
god
cried
buxton
rising
in
his
excitement
and
standing
over
anthony
who
looked
at
him
astonished
and
bewildered
you
and
your
england
would
parcel
out
the
kingdom
of
heaven
into
national
churches
as
you
name
them
among
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
yet
you
call
yourselves
the
servants
of
him
who
came
to
do
just
the
opposite
yes
and
who
will
do
it
in
spite
of
you
and
make
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
instead
the
kingdom
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
why
if
each
nation
is
to
have
her
church
why
not
each
county
and
each
town
yes
and
each
separate
soul
too
for
all
are
different
nay
nay
master
norris
you
are
blinded
by
the
prince
of
this
world
he
is
shewing
you
even
now
from
an
high
mountain
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
and
the
glory
of
them
lift
your
eyes
dear
lad
to
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
your
help
those
hills
higher
than
the
mountain
where
you
stand
and
see
the
new
jerusalem
and
the
glory
of
her
coming
down
from
god
to
dwell
with
men
buxton
stood
his
eyes
blazing
plainly
carried
away
wholly
by
enthusiasm
and
anthony
in
spite
of
himself
could
not
be
angry
he
moistened
his
lips
once
or
twice
well
sir
of
course
i
hold
with
what
you
say
in
one
sense
but
it
is
not
come
yet
and
never
will
till
our
lord
comes
back
to
make
all
plain
not
come
yet
cried
the
other
not
come
yet
why
what
is
the
one
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
but
that
there
you
have
one
visible
kingdom
gathered
out
of
every
nation
and
tongue
and
people
as
the
apostle
said
i
have
a
little
estate
in
france
master
norris
where
i
go
sometimes
and
there
are
folk
in
their
wooden
shoes
talking
a
different
human
tongue
to
me
but
thank
god
the
same
divine
one
of
contrition
and
adoration
and
prayer
there
we
have
the
same
mass
the
same
priesthood
the
same
blessed
sacrament
and
the
same
faith
as
in
my
own
little
oratory
at
stanfield
go
to
spain
africa
rome
india
wherever
christ
is
preached
there
is
the
church
as
it
is
here
the
city
of
peace
and
as
for
you
and
your
church
with
whom
do
you
hold
communion
this
stung
anthony
and
he
answered
impulsively
in
geneva
and
frankfort
at
least
there
are
folk
who
speak
the
same
divine
tongue
as
you
call
it
as
we
do
they
and
we
are
agreed
in
matters
of
faith
indeed
said
burton
sharply
then
what
becomes
of
your
nationalism
and
the
varied
temperaments
that
you
told
me
god
had
made
anthony
bit
his
lip
he
had
overshot
his
mark
but
the
other
swept
on
and
as
he
talked
began
to
step
up
and
down
the
little
room
in
a
kind
of
rhapsody
is
it
possible
he
cried
that
men
should
be
so
blind
as
to
prefer
the
little
divided
companies
they
name
national
churches
all
confusion
and
denial
to
that
glorious
kingdom
that
christ
bought
with
his
own
dear
blood
and
has
built
upon
peter
against
which
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
yes
i
know
it
is
a
flattering
and
a
pleasant
thought
that
this
little
nation
should
have
her
own
church
and
it
is
humbling
and
bitter
that
england
should
be
called
to
submit
to
a
foreign
potentate
in
the
affairs
of
faith
nay
cry
they
like
the
jews
of
old
not
christ
but
barabbas
we
will
not
have
this
man
to
reign
over
us
and
yet
this
is
god
will
and
not
that
mark
me
norris
what
you
hope
will
never
come
to
be
the
liar
will
not
keep
his
word
you
shall
not
have
that
national
church
that
you
desire
as
you
have
dealt
so
will
it
be
dealt
to
you
as
you
have
rejected
so
will
you
be
rejected
england
herself
will
cast
you
off
your
religious
folk
will
break
into
a
hundred
divisions
even
now
your
puritans
mock
at
your
prelates
so
soon
and
if
they
do
thus
now
what
will
they
do
hereafter
you
have
cast
away
authority
and
authority
shall
forsake
you
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
forgive
me
norris
he
added
after
a
pause
if
i
have
been
discourteous
and
have
forgotten
my
manners
but
but
i
would
as
the
apostle
said
that
you
were
altogether
as
i
am
except
these
bonds
chapter
iv
a
isabel
was
sitting
out
alone
in
the
italian
garden
at
the
hall
one
afternoon
in
the
summer
following
the
visit
to
deptford
hubert
was
down
at
plymouth
assisting
in
the
preparations
for
the
expedition
that
drake
hoped
to
conduct
against
spain
the
two
countries
were
technically
at
peace
but
the
object
with
which
he
was
going
out
with
the
moral
and
financial
support
of
the
queen
was
a
corporate
demonstration
against
spain
of
french
portuguese
and
english
ships
under
the
main
command
of
don
antonio
the
portuguese
pretender
it
was
proposed
to
occupy
terceira
in
the
azores
and
drake
and
hawkins
entertained
the
highest
hopes
of
laying
their
hands
on
further
plunder
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
seat
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
thinking
over
her
relations
with
hubert
when
he
had
been
at
home
at
the
end
of
the
previous
year
he
had
apparently
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
marriage
would
be
celebrated
he
had
given
her
the
gold
nugget
that
she
had
showed
anthony
telling
her
he
had
brought
it
home
for
the
and
she
understood
that
he
was
to
come
for
his
final
answer
as
soon
as
his
work
at
plymouth
was
over
but
not
a
word
of
explanation
had
passed
between
them
on
the
religious
difficulty
he
had
silenced
her
emphatically
and
kindly
once
when
she
had
approached
it
and
she
gathered
from
his
manner
that
he
suspected
the
direction
in
which
her
mind
was
turning
and
was
generously
unwilling
for
her
to
commit
herself
an
inch
further
than
she
saw
else
whence
came
his
assurance
and
for
herself
things
were
indeed
becoming
plain
she
wondered
why
she
had
hesitated
so
long
why
she
was
still
hesitating
the
cup
was
brimming
above
the
edge
it
needed
but
a
faint
touch
of
stimulus
to
precipitate
all
and
so
isabel
lay
back
and
pondered
with
a
touch
of
happy
impatience
at
the
workings
of
her
own
soul
for
she
dared
not
act
without
the
final
touch
of
conviction
mistress
margaret
had
taught
her
that
the
swiftest
flight
of
the
soul
was
when
there
was
least
movement
when
the
soul
knew
how
to
throw
itself
with
that
supreme
effort
of
cessation
into
the
hands
of
god
that
he
might
bear
it
along
when
after
informing
the
intellect
and
seeking
by
prayer
for
god
bounty
the
humble
client
of
heaven
waited
with
uplifted
eyes
and
ready
heart
until
god
should
answer
and
so
she
waited
knowing
that
the
gift
was
at
hand
yet
not
daring
to
snatch
it
but
in
the
meanwhile
her
imagination
at
least
might
act
without
restraint
so
she
sent
it
out
like
a
bird
from
the
ark
to
bring
her
the
earnest
of
peace
there
in
the
somewhere
lay
the
chapel
where
she
and
hubert
would
kneel
together
somewhere
beneath
that
grey
roof
that
was
the
terrace
where
she
would
walk
one
day
as
one
who
has
a
right
there
which
of
these
windows
would
be
hers
not
lady
maxwell
of
course
she
must
keep
that
ah
how
good
god
was
the
tall
door
on
to
the
terrace
opened
and
mistress
margaret
peered
out
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
isabel
called
to
her
and
the
old
nun
came
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
why
did
she
walk
so
falteringly
the
girl
wondered
as
if
she
could
not
see
what
was
it
what
was
it
isabel
rose
to
her
feet
startled
as
the
nun
with
bent
head
came
up
the
path
what
is
it
mistress
margaret
the
other
tried
to
smile
at
her
but
her
lips
were
trembling
too
much
and
the
girl
saw
that
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
she
put
the
letter
into
her
hand
isabel
lifted
it
in
an
agony
of
suspense
and
saw
her
name
in
handwriting
what
is
it
she
said
again
white
to
the
lips
the
old
lady
as
she
turned
away
glanced
at
her
and
isabel
saw
that
her
face
was
all
twitching
with
the
effort
to
keep
back
her
tears
the
girl
had
never
seen
her
like
that
before
even
at
sir
nicholas
death
was
there
anything
she
wondered
as
she
looked
worse
than
death
but
she
was
too
dazed
by
the
sight
to
speak
and
mistress
margaret
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
unquestioned
isabel
turned
the
letter
over
once
or
twice
and
then
sat
down
and
opened
it
it
was
all
in
hubert
sprawling
handwriting
and
was
dated
from
plymouth
it
gave
her
news
first
about
the
squadron
saying
how
don
antonio
had
left
london
for
plymouth
and
was
expected
daily
and
then
followed
this
paragraph
and
now
dearest
isabel
i
have
such
good
news
to
give
you
have
turned
and
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
married
as
soon
as
i
return
i
know
this
will
make
you
happy
to
think
that
our
religions
are
no
longer
different
i
have
thought
of
this
so
long
but
would
not
tell
you
before
for
fear
of
disappointing
you
sir
francis
drake
religion
seems
to
me
the
best
it
is
the
religion
of
all
the
as
they
name
us
and
of
the
queen
grace
and
it
will
be
soon
of
all
england
and
more
than
all
it
is
the
religion
of
my
dearest
mistress
and
love
i
do
not
of
course
know
very
much
of
it
as
yet
but
good
collins
here
has
shown
me
the
superstitions
of
popery
and
i
hope
now
to
be
justified
by
faith
without
works
as
the
gospel
teaches
i
fear
that
my
mother
and
aunt
will
be
much
distressed
by
this
news
i
have
written
too
to
tell
them
of
it
you
must
comfort
them
dear
love
and
perhaps
some
day
they
too
will
see
as
we
do
then
followed
a
few
messages
and
loving
phrases
and
the
letter
ended
isabel
laid
it
down
beside
her
on
the
low
stone
wall
and
looked
round
her
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
there
was
the
grey
old
house
before
her
and
the
terrace
and
the
to
the
left
and
the
hot
sunshine
lay
on
it
all
and
drew
out
scents
and
colours
from
the
and
joy
from
the
insects
that
danced
in
the
trembling
air
and
it
all
meant
nothing
to
her
like
a
picture
when
the
page
is
turned
over
it
five
minutes
ago
she
was
regarding
her
life
and
seeing
how
the
grace
of
god
was
slowly
sorting
out
its
elements
from
chaos
to
order
the
road
was
unwinding
itself
before
her
eyes
as
she
trod
on
it
day
by
day
now
a
hand
had
swept
all
back
into
disorder
and
the
path
was
hidden
by
the
ruins
then
gradually
one
thought
detached
itself
and
burned
before
her
vivid
and
startling
and
in
all
its
terrible
reality
slipped
between
her
and
the
visible
world
on
which
she
was
staring
it
was
this
to
embrace
the
catholic
faith
meant
the
renouncing
of
hubert
as
a
protestant
she
might
conceivably
have
married
a
catholic
as
a
catholic
it
was
inconceivable
that
she
should
marry
an
apostate
then
she
read
the
letter
through
again
carefully
and
slowly
and
was
astonished
at
the
unreality
of
hubert
words
about
romish
superstition
and
gospel
simplicity
she
tried
hard
to
silence
her
thoughts
but
two
reasons
for
hubert
change
of
religion
rose
up
and
insisted
on
making
themselves
felt
it
was
that
he
might
be
more
in
unity
with
the
buccaneers
whom
he
admired
second
that
there
might
be
no
obstacle
to
their
marriage
and
what
then
she
asked
was
the
quality
of
the
heart
he
had
given
her
then
in
a
flash
of
intuition
she
perceived
that
a
struggle
lay
before
her
compared
with
which
all
her
previous
spiritual
conflicts
were
as
child
play
and
that
there
was
no
avoiding
it
the
vision
passed
and
she
rose
and
went
indoors
to
find
the
desolate
mother
whose
boy
had
lost
the
faith
a
month
or
two
of
misery
went
by
for
lady
maxwell
they
passed
with
recurring
gusts
of
sorrow
and
of
agonies
of
prayer
for
her
apostate
son
mistress
margaret
was
at
the
hall
all
day
soothing
encouraging
even
distracting
her
sister
by
all
the
means
in
her
power
the
mother
wrote
one
passionate
wail
to
her
son
appealing
to
all
that
she
thought
he
held
dear
even
yet
to
return
to
the
faith
for
which
his
father
had
suffered
and
in
which
he
had
died
but
a
short
answer
only
returned
saying
it
was
impossible
to
make
his
defence
in
a
letter
and
expressing
pious
hopes
that
she
too
one
day
would
be
as
he
was
the
same
courier
brought
a
letter
to
isabel
in
which
he
expressed
his
wonder
that
she
had
not
answered
his
former
one
and
as
for
isabel
she
had
to
pass
through
this
valley
of
darkness
alone
anthony
was
in
london
and
even
if
he
had
been
with
her
could
not
have
helped
her
under
these
circumstances
her
father
was
dead
she
thanked
god
for
that
now
and
mistress
margaret
seemed
absorbed
in
her
grief
and
so
the
girl
fought
with
devils
alone
the
arguments
for
catholicism
burned
pitilessly
clear
now
every
line
and
feature
in
them
stood
out
distinct
and
hard
catholicism
it
appeared
to
her
alone
had
the
marks
of
the
bride
visible
unity
visible
catholicity
visible
apostolicity
visible
sanctity
there
they
were
the
seals
of
the
most
high
god
she
flung
herself
back
furiously
into
the
protestantism
from
which
she
had
been
emerging
there
burned
in
the
dark
before
her
the
marks
of
the
beast
visible
disunion
visible
nationalism
visible
erastianism
visible
gulfs
where
holiness
should
be
that
system
in
which
now
she
could
never
find
rest
again
glared
at
her
in
all
its
unconvincing
incoherence
its
lack
of
spirituality
its
adulterous
union
with
the
civil
power
instead
of
the
pure
wedlock
of
the
spouse
of
christ
she
wondered
once
more
how
she
dared
to
have
hesitated
so
long
or
dared
to
hesitate
still
on
the
theological
side
intellectual
arguments
of
this
kind
started
out
strong
and
irrefutable
her
emotional
drawings
towards
catholicism
for
the
present
retired
feelings
might
have
been
disregarded
or
discredited
by
a
strong
effort
of
the
will
these
apparently
cold
phenomena
that
presented
themselves
to
her
intellect
could
not
be
thus
dealt
with
yet
strangely
enough
even
now
she
would
not
throw
herself
resolutely
into
catholicism
the
fierce
stimulus
instead
of
precipitating
the
crisis
petrified
it
more
than
once
she
started
up
from
her
knees
in
her
own
dark
room
resolved
to
awaken
the
nun
and
tell
her
she
would
wait
no
longer
but
would
turn
catholic
at
once
and
have
finished
with
the
misery
of
suspense
and
even
as
she
moved
to
the
door
her
will
found
itself
against
an
impenetrable
wall
and
then
on
the
other
side
all
her
human
nature
cried
out
for
hubert
hubert
hubert
there
he
stood
by
her
in
fancy
day
and
night
that
chivalrous
courteous
lad
who
had
been
loyal
to
her
so
long
had
waited
so
patiently
had
run
to
her
with
such
dear
impatience
who
was
so
wholesome
so
strong
so
humble
to
her
so
quick
to
understand
her
wants
so
eager
to
fulfil
them
so
bound
to
her
by
associations
so
fit
a
mate
for
the
very
differences
between
them
and
now
these
two
claims
were
no
longer
compatible
in
his
very
love
for
her
he
had
ended
that
possibility
all
those
old
dreams
the
little
scenes
she
had
rehearsed
of
their
first
mass
their
first
communion
together
their
walks
in
the
twilight
their
rides
over
the
hills
the
new
ties
that
were
to
draw
the
old
ladies
at
the
hall
and
herself
so
close
together
all
this
was
changed
some
of
those
dreams
were
now
for
ever
impossible
others
only
possible
on
terms
that
she
trembled
even
to
think
of
perhaps
it
was
worst
of
all
to
reflect
that
she
was
in
some
measure
responsible
for
his
change
of
religion
she
fancied
that
it
was
through
her
slowness
to
respond
to
light
her
delaying
to
confide
in
him
that
he
had
been
driven
through
impatience
to
take
this
step
and
so
week
after
week
went
by
and
she
dared
not
answer
his
letter
the
old
ladies
too
were
sorely
puzzled
at
her
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
know
how
far
her
religion
was
changing
she
had
kept
up
the
same
reserve
towards
them
lately
as
towards
hubert
chiefly
because
she
feared
to
disappoint
them
and
so
after
an
attempt
to
tell
each
other
a
little
of
their
mutual
sympathy
the
three
women
were
silent
on
the
subject
of
the
lad
who
was
so
much
to
them
all
she
began
to
show
her
state
a
little
in
her
movements
and
appearance
she
was
languid
soon
tired
and
dispirited
she
would
go
for
short
lonely
walks
and
fall
asleep
in
her
chair
worn
out
when
she
came
in
her
grey
eyes
looked
longer
and
darker
her
eyelids
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
began
to
droop
a
little
then
in
october
he
came
home
isabel
had
been
out
a
long
afternoon
walk
by
herself
through
the
reddening
woods
they
had
never
since
the
first
awakening
of
the
consciousness
of
beauty
in
her
meant
so
little
to
her
as
now
it
appeared
as
if
that
keen
unity
of
a
life
common
to
her
and
all
living
things
had
been
broken
or
obscured
and
that
she
walked
in
an
isolation
all
the
more
terrible
in
that
she
was
surrounded
by
the
dumb
presence
of
what
she
loved
last
year
the
quick
chattering
cry
of
the
blackbird
the
evening
mists
over
the
meadows
the
stir
of
the
fading
life
of
the
woods
the
rustling
scamper
of
the
rabbit
over
the
dead
leaves
the
solemn
call
of
the
homing
rooks
all
this
only
last
year
went
to
make
up
the
sweet
natural
atmosphere
in
which
her
spirit
moved
and
breathed
at
ease
now
she
was
excommunicate
from
that
pleasant
friendship
banned
by
nature
and
forgotten
by
the
god
who
made
it
and
was
immanent
within
it
her
relations
to
the
saviour
who
only
such
a
short
time
ago
had
been
the
person
round
whom
all
the
joys
of
life
had
centred
from
whom
they
radiated
and
to
whom
she
referred
them
all
these
relations
had
begun
to
be
obscured
by
her
love
for
hubert
and
now
had
vanished
altogether
she
had
regarded
her
earthly
and
her
heavenly
lover
as
two
persons
each
of
whom
had
certain
claims
upon
her
heart
and
each
of
whom
she
had
hoped
to
satisfy
in
different
ways
instead
of
identifying
the
two
and
serving
each
not
apart
from
but
in
the
other
and
it
now
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
making
experience
of
a
divine
jealousy
that
would
suffer
her
to
be
satisfied
neither
with
god
nor
man
her
soul
was
exhausted
by
internal
conflict
by
the
swift
alternations
of
attraction
and
repulsion
between
the
poles
of
her
supernatural
and
natural
life
so
that
when
it
turned
wearily
from
self
to
what
lay
outside
it
was
not
even
capable
as
before
of
making
that
supreme
effort
of
cessation
of
effort
which
was
necessary
to
its
peace
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
in
emptiness
and
could
neither
touch
heaven
or
earth
crucified
so
high
that
she
could
not
rest
on
earth
so
low
that
she
could
not
reach
to
heaven
she
came
in
weary
and
dispirited
as
the
candles
were
being
lighted
in
her
upstairs
but
she
saw
the
gleam
of
them
from
the
garden
with
no
sense
of
a
welcoming
brightness
she
passed
from
the
garden
into
the
door
of
the
hall
which
was
still
dark
as
the
fire
had
nearly
burned
itself
out
as
she
entered
the
door
opposite
opened
and
once
more
she
saw
the
silhouette
of
a
man
figure
against
the
lighted
passage
beyond
and
again
she
stopped
frightened
and
whispered
anthony
there
was
a
momentary
pause
as
the
door
closed
and
all
was
dark
again
and
then
she
heard
hubert
voice
say
her
name
and
felt
herself
wrapped
once
more
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
she
clung
to
him
with
furious
longing
ah
this
is
a
tangible
thing
she
felt
this
clasp
the
faint
cleanly
smell
of
his
rough
frieze
dress
refreshed
her
like
wine
and
she
kissed
his
sleeve
passionately
and
the
wide
gulf
between
them
yawned
again
and
her
spirit
sickened
at
the
sight
of
it
oh
hubert
hubert
she
said
she
felt
herself
half
carried
to
a
high
chair
beside
the
and
set
down
there
then
he
the
logs
on
the
hearth
so
that
the
flames
began
to
leap
again
showing
his
strong
hands
and
keen
face
then
he
turned
on
his
knees
seized
her
two
hands
in
his
own
and
lifted
them
to
his
lips
then
laid
them
down
again
on
her
knee
still
holding
them
and
so
remained
oh
isabel
he
said
why
did
you
not
write
she
was
silent
as
one
who
stares
fascinated
down
a
precipice
it
is
all
over
he
went
on
in
a
moment
with
the
expedition
the
queen
grace
has
finally
refused
us
leave
to
go
and
i
have
come
back
to
you
isabel
how
strong
and
pleasant
he
looked
in
this
leaping
how
real
and
she
was
hesitating
between
this
warm
human
reality
and
the
chilly
possibilities
of
an
invisible
truth
her
hands
tightened
instinctively
within
his
and
then
relaxed
i
have
been
so
wretched
she
said
piteously
ah
my
dear
and
he
threw
an
arm
round
her
neck
and
drew
her
face
down
to
his
but
that
is
over
now
she
sat
back
again
and
then
an
access
of
purpose
poured
into
her
and
braced
her
will
to
an
effort
no
no
she
began
i
must
tell
you
i
was
afraid
to
write
hubert
i
must
wait
a
little
longer
i
i
do
not
know
what
i
believe
he
looked
at
her
puzzled
what
do
you
mean
dearest
i
have
been
so
much
puzzled
lately
thinking
so
much
and
and
i
am
sorry
you
have
become
a
protestant
it
makes
all
so
hard
my
dear
this
is
i
do
not
understand
i
have
been
thinking
went
on
isabel
bravely
whether
perhaps
the
catholic
church
is
not
right
after
all
hubert
loosed
her
hands
and
stood
up
she
crouched
into
the
shadow
of
the
interior
of
the
high
chair
and
looked
up
at
him
terrified
his
cheek
twitched
a
little
isabel
this
is
foolishness
i
know
what
the
catholic
faith
is
it
is
not
true
i
have
been
through
it
all
he
was
speaking
nervously
and
abruptly
she
said
nothing
then
he
suddenly
dropped
on
his
knees
himself
my
dearest
i
understand
you
were
doing
this
for
me
i
quite
understand
it
is
what
i
too
and
then
he
stopped
i
know
i
know
she
cried
piteously
it
is
just
what
i
have
feared
so
terribly
that
that
our
love
has
been
blinding
us
both
and
yet
what
are
we
to
do
what
are
we
to
do
oh
god
hubert
help
me
then
he
began
to
speak
in
a
low
emphatic
voice
holding
her
hands
delicately
stroking
one
of
them
now
and
again
and
playing
with
her
fingers
she
watched
his
curly
head
in
the
firelight
as
he
talked
and
his
keen
face
as
he
looked
up
it
is
all
plain
to
me
he
said
caressingly
you
have
been
living
here
with
my
aunt
a
dear
old
saint
and
she
has
been
talking
and
telling
you
all
about
the
catholic
religion
and
making
it
seem
all
true
and
good
and
you
my
dear
child
have
been
thinking
of
me
sometimes
and
loving
me
a
little
is
it
not
so
and
longing
that
religion
should
not
separate
us
and
so
you
began
to
wish
it
was
true
and
then
to
hope
it
was
and
at
last
you
have
begun
to
think
it
is
but
it
is
not
your
true
sweet
self
that
believes
it
ah
you
know
in
your
heart
of
hearts
as
i
have
known
so
long
that
it
is
not
true
that
it
is
made
up
by
priests
and
nuns
and
it
is
very
beautiful
i
know
my
dearest
but
it
is
only
a
lovely
tale
and
you
must
not
spoil
all
for
the
sake
of
a
tale
and
i
have
been
gradually
led
to
the
light
it
was
your
and
his
voice
faltered
your
prayers
that
helped
me
to
it
i
have
longed
to
understand
what
it
was
that
made
you
so
sweet
and
so
happy
and
now
i
know
it
is
your
own
simple
pure
religion
and
and
it
is
so
much
more
sensible
so
much
more
likely
to
be
true
than
the
catholic
religion
it
is
all
in
the
bible
you
see
so
plain
as
collins
has
showed
me
and
so
my
dear
love
i
have
come
to
believe
it
too
and
you
must
put
all
these
fancies
out
of
your
head
these
dreams
though
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
he
kissed
her
hand
again
for
wishing
to
believe
them
for
my
sake
and
and
we
will
be
married
before
christmas
and
we
will
have
our
own
but
it
shall
be
a
true
one
this
was
terrible
to
isabel
it
seemed
as
if
her
own
haunting
thought
that
she
was
sacrificing
a
dream
to
reality
had
become
incarnate
in
her
lover
and
was
speaking
through
his
lips
and
yet
in
its
very
incarnation
it
seemed
to
reveal
its
weakness
rather
than
its
strength
as
a
dark
suggestion
the
thought
was
mighty
embodied
in
actual
language
it
seemed
to
shrink
a
little
but
then
on
the
other
hand
and
so
the
interior
conflict
began
to
rage
again
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
stand
up
but
he
pressed
her
back
into
the
chair
no
my
dearest
you
shall
be
a
prisoner
until
you
give
your
parole
twice
isabel
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
no
sound
came
it
seemed
as
if
the
raging
strife
of
thoughts
deafened
and
paralysed
her
now
isabel
said
hubert
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
cried
desperately
you
must
give
me
time
it
is
too
sudden
your
returning
like
this
you
must
give
me
time
i
do
not
know
what
i
believe
oh
dear
god
help
me
isabel
promise
promise
before
christmas
i
thought
it
was
all
to
be
so
happy
when
i
came
in
through
the
garden
just
now
my
mother
will
hardly
speak
to
me
and
i
came
to
you
isabel
as
i
always
did
i
felt
so
sure
you
would
be
good
to
me
and
tell
me
that
you
would
always
love
me
now
that
i
had
given
up
my
religion
for
love
of
you
and
now
and
hubert
voice
ended
in
a
sob
her
heart
seemed
rent
across
and
she
drew
a
sobbing
sigh
hubert
heard
it
and
caught
at
her
hands
again
as
he
knelt
isabel
promise
promise
then
there
came
that
gust
of
purpose
into
her
heart
again
she
made
a
determined
effort
and
stood
up
and
hubert
rose
and
stood
opposite
her
you
must
not
ask
me
she
said
bravely
it
would
be
wicked
to
decide
yet
i
can
not
see
anything
clearly
i
do
not
know
what
i
believe
nor
where
i
stand
you
must
give
me
time
there
was
a
dead
silence
his
face
was
so
much
in
shadow
that
she
could
not
tell
what
he
was
thinking
he
was
standing
perfectly
still
then
that
is
all
the
answer
you
will
give
me
he
said
in
a
perfectly
even
voice
isabel
bowed
her
head
then
then
i
wish
you
mistress
norris
and
he
bowed
to
her
caught
up
his
cap
and
went
out
she
could
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
and
caught
her
breath
to
cry
out
after
him
as
the
door
closed
but
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stone
pavement
outside
the
crunch
of
the
gravel
and
he
was
gone
then
she
went
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
curved
mantelshelf
and
stared
into
the
logs
that
his
hands
had
piled
together
this
then
she
thought
was
the
work
of
religion
the
end
of
all
her
aspirations
and
efforts
that
god
should
mock
them
by
bringing
love
into
their
life
and
then
when
they
caught
at
it
and
thanked
him
for
it
it
was
whisked
away
again
and
left
their
hands
empty
was
this
the
father
of
love
in
whom
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
who
treated
his
children
like
this
and
so
the
bitter
thoughts
went
on
and
yet
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
was
powerless
that
she
could
not
go
to
the
door
and
call
hubert
and
promise
what
he
asked
a
great
force
had
laid
hold
of
her
it
might
be
benevolent
or
not
at
this
moment
she
thought
not
but
it
was
irresistible
and
she
must
bow
her
head
and
obey
and
even
as
she
thought
that
the
door
opened
again
and
there
was
hubert
he
came
in
two
quick
steps
across
the
room
to
her
and
then
stopped
suddenly
mistress
isabel
he
asked
can
you
forgive
me
i
was
a
brute
just
now
i
do
not
ask
for
your
promise
i
leave
it
all
in
your
hands
do
with
me
what
you
will
but
but
if
you
could
tell
me
how
long
you
think
it
will
be
before
you
know
he
had
touched
the
right
note
isabel
heart
gave
a
leap
of
sorrow
and
sympathy
oh
hubert
she
said
brokenly
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
promise
i
will
tell
you
by
easter
and
her
tone
was
interrogative
yes
yes
said
hubert
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
and
she
saw
strange
lines
quivering
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
large
and
brilliant
in
the
firelight
then
the
two
drew
together
and
he
took
her
in
his
arms
strongly
and
passionately
there
was
a
scene
that
night
between
the
mother
and
son
mistress
margaret
had
gone
back
to
the
dower
house
for
supper
and
lady
maxwell
and
hubert
were
supping
in
sir
nicholas
old
study
that
would
soon
be
arranged
for
hubert
now
that
he
had
returned
for
good
they
had
been
very
silent
during
the
meal
while
the
servants
were
in
the
room
talking
only
of
little
village
affairs
and
of
the
estate
and
of
the
cancelling
of
the
proposed
expedition
hubert
had
explained
to
his
mother
that
it
was
generally
believed
that
elizabeth
had
never
seriously
intended
the
english
ships
to
sail
but
that
she
only
wished
to
draw
spain
attention
off
herself
by
setting
up
complications
between
that
country
and
france
and
when
she
had
succeeded
in
this
by
managing
to
get
the
french
squadron
safe
at
terceira
she
then
withdrew
her
permission
to
drake
and
hawkins
and
thus
escaped
from
the
quarrel
altogether
but
it
was
a
poor
makeshift
for
conversation
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
a
silence
fell
presently
hubert
looked
across
the
table
between
the
silver
branched
candlesticks
mother
he
said
of
course
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
but
i
can
not
consent
to
go
through
all
the
arguments
i
am
weary
of
them
neither
will
i
see
barnes
at
cuckfield
or
here
i
am
satisfied
with
my
position
my
son
said
lady
maxwell
with
dignity
i
do
not
think
i
have
spoken
that
priest
name
or
indeed
any
well
said
hubert
impatiently
at
any
rate
i
will
not
see
him
but
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
about
this
house
we
must
have
our
positions
clear
my
father
left
to
your
use
did
he
not
the
whole
of
the
i
am
delighted
dear
mother
that
he
did
so
you
will
be
happy
there
i
know
and
of
course
i
need
not
say
that
i
hope
you
will
keep
your
old
room
overhead
as
well
and
indeed
use
the
whole
house
as
you
have
always
done
i
shall
be
grateful
if
you
will
superintend
it
all
as
before
at
least
until
a
new
mistress
comes
thank
you
my
son
i
will
speak
of
that
in
a
moment
he
went
on
looking
steadily
at
the
but
there
was
a
word
i
wished
to
say
first
i
am
now
a
loyal
subject
of
her
grace
in
all
things
in
religion
as
in
all
else
and
and
i
fear
i
can
not
continue
to
entertain
seminary
priests
as
my
father
used
to
do
my
my
conscience
will
not
allow
that
but
of
course
mother
i
need
not
say
that
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
what
you
will
in
the
i
shall
ask
no
questions
and
i
shall
set
no
traps
or
spies
but
i
must
ask
that
the
priests
do
not
come
into
this
part
of
the
house
nor
walk
in
the
garden
fortunately
you
have
a
lawn
in
the
cloister
so
that
they
need
not
lack
fresh
air
or
exercise
you
need
not
fear
hubert
said
his
mother
i
will
not
embarrass
you
you
shall
be
in
no
danger
i
think
you
need
not
have
said
that
mother
i
am
not
usually
thought
a
coward
lady
maxwell
flushed
a
little
and
began
to
finger
her
silver
knife
however
hubert
went
on
i
thought
it
best
to
say
that
the
chapel
you
see
is
in
that
wing
and
you
have
that
lawn
and
and
i
do
not
think
i
am
treating
you
hardly
and
is
your
brother
james
not
to
come
asked
his
mother
i
have
thought
much
over
that
said
hubert
and
although
it
is
hard
to
say
it
i
think
he
had
better
not
come
to
my
part
of
the
house
at
least
not
when
i
am
here
i
must
know
nothing
of
it
you
must
do
what
you
think
well
when
i
am
away
about
him
and
others
too
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
mother
please
do
not
add
to
the
difficulty
you
need
not
fear
said
lady
maxwell
steadily
you
shall
not
be
troubled
with
any
catholics
besides
ourselves
then
that
is
arranged
said
the
lad
and
now
there
is
a
word
more
what
have
you
been
doing
to
isabel
and
he
looked
sharply
across
the
table
his
mother
eyes
met
his
fearlessly
i
do
not
understand
you
she
said
mother
you
must
know
what
i
mean
you
have
seen
her
continually
i
have
told
you
my
son
that
i
do
not
know
why
burst
out
hubert
she
is
half
a
catholic
thank
god
said
his
mother
ah
yes
you
thank
god
i
know
but
whom
am
i
to
thank
for
it
i
would
that
you
could
thank
him
too
hubert
made
a
sharp
sound
of
disgust
ah
yes
he
said
scornfully
i
knew
it
nobis
and
the
rest
hubert
said
lady
maxwell
i
do
not
think
you
mean
to
insult
me
in
this
house
but
either
that
is
an
insult
or
else
i
misunderstood
you
wholly
and
must
ask
your
pardon
for
it
well
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
i
will
make
myself
plain
i
believe
that
it
is
through
the
influence
of
you
and
aunt
margaret
that
this
has
been
brought
about
at
the
moment
he
spoke
the
door
opened
come
in
margaret
said
her
sister
this
concerns
you
the
old
nun
came
across
to
hubert
with
her
anxious
sweet
face
and
put
her
old
hand
tenderly
on
his
black
satin
sleeve
as
he
sat
and
wrenched
at
a
nut
between
his
fingers
hubert
dear
boy
she
said
what
is
all
this
will
you
tell
me
hubert
rose
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
and
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it
and
then
drew
out
a
chair
for
his
aunt
and
put
a
for
her
sit
down
aunt
he
said
and
pushed
the
decanter
towards
her
i
have
just
left
isabel
she
said
she
is
very
unhappy
about
something
you
saw
her
this
evening
dear
lad
yes
said
hubert
heavily
looking
down
at
the
table
and
taking
up
another
nut
and
it
is
of
that
that
i
have
been
speaking
who
has
made
her
unhappy
i
had
hoped
you
would
tell
us
that
said
mistress
margaret
i
came
up
to
ask
you
my
son
has
done
us
me
the
honour
began
lady
maxwell
but
hubert
broke
in
i
left
isabel
here
last
christmas
happy
and
a
protestant
i
have
come
back
here
now
to
find
her
unhappy
and
half
a
catholic
if
not
more
and
oh
are
you
sure
asked
mistress
margaret
her
eyes
shining
thank
god
if
it
be
so
sure
said
hubert
why
she
will
not
marry
me
at
least
not
yet
oh
poor
lad
she
said
tenderly
to
have
lost
both
god
and
isabel
hubert
turned
on
her
savagely
but
the
old
nun
eyes
were
steady
and
serene
poor
lad
she
said
again
hubert
looked
down
again
his
lip
wrinkled
up
in
a
little
sneer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
said
i
can
understand
your
not
caring
but
i
am
astonished
at
this
response
of
yours
to
her
confidence
lady
maxwell
grew
white
to
the
lips
i
have
told
you
she
began
but
you
do
not
seem
to
believe
it
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
so
far
as
i
know
with
her
conversion
which
and
she
raised
her
voice
bravely
i
pray
god
to
accomplish
she
has
of
course
asked
me
questions
now
and
then
and
i
have
answered
them
that
is
all
and
i
said
mistress
margaret
plead
guilty
to
the
same
charge
and
to
no
other
you
are
not
yourself
dear
boy
at
present
and
indeed
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
and
i
pray
god
to
help
you
but
you
are
not
yourself
or
you
would
not
speak
like
this
to
your
mother
hubert
rose
to
his
feet
his
face
was
white
under
the
tan
and
the
ruffle
round
his
wrist
trembled
as
he
leaned
heavily
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
i
am
only
a
plain
protestant
now
he
said
bitterly
and
i
have
been
with
protestants
so
long
that
i
have
forgotten
catholic
ways
but
stay
hubert
said
his
mother
do
not
finish
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
presently
if
you
do
come
margaret
and
she
moved
towards
the
door
her
son
went
quickly
past
and
opened
it
nay
nay
said
the
nun
do
you
be
going
mary
let
me
stay
with
the
lad
and
we
will
come
to
you
presently
lady
maxwell
bowed
her
head
and
passed
out
and
hubert
closed
the
door
mistress
margaret
looked
down
on
the
table
you
have
given
me
a
glass
dear
boy
but
no
wine
in
it
hubert
took
a
couple
of
quick
steps
back
and
faced
her
it
is
no
use
it
is
no
use
he
burst
out
and
his
voice
was
broken
with
emotion
you
can
not
turn
me
like
that
oh
what
have
you
done
with
my
isabel
he
put
out
his
hand
and
seized
her
arm
give
her
back
to
me
aunt
margaret
give
her
back
to
me
he
dropped
into
his
seat
and
hid
his
face
on
his
arm
and
there
was
a
sob
or
two
sit
up
and
be
a
man
hubert
broke
in
mistress
margaret
voice
clear
and
cool
he
looked
up
in
amazement
with
wet
indignant
eyes
she
was
looking
at
him
smiling
tenderly
and
now
for
the
second
time
give
me
half
a
glass
of
wine
dear
boy
he
poured
it
out
bewildered
at
her
for
a
man
that
has
been
round
the
world
she
said
you
are
but
a
foolish
child
what
do
you
mean
have
you
never
thought
of
a
way
of
yet
winning
isabel
she
asked
what
do
you
mean
he
repeated
why
come
back
to
the
church
dear
lad
and
make
your
mother
and
me
happy
again
and
marry
isabel
and
save
your
own
soul
aunt
margaret
he
cried
it
is
impossible
i
have
truly
lost
my
faith
in
the
catholic
religion
and
and
you
would
not
have
me
a
hypocrite
ah
ah
said
the
nun
you
can
not
tell
yet
please
god
it
may
come
back
oh
dear
boy
in
your
heart
you
know
it
is
true
before
god
in
my
heart
i
know
that
it
is
not
true
no
no
no
she
said
but
the
light
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
stretched
a
tremulous
hand
yes
aunt
margaret
it
is
so
for
years
and
years
i
have
been
doubting
but
i
kept
on
just
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
best
religion
and
and
i
would
not
be
driven
out
of
it
by
her
grace
laws
against
my
will
like
a
dog
stoned
from
his
kennel
but
you
are
only
a
lad
still
she
said
piteously
he
laughed
a
little
but
i
have
had
the
gift
of
reason
and
discretion
nearly
twenty
years
a
priest
would
tell
me
besides
aunt
margaret
i
could
not
be
such
a
a
cur
as
to
come
back
without
believing
i
could
never
look
isabel
in
the
eyes
again
well
well
said
the
old
lady
let
us
wait
and
see
do
you
intend
to
be
here
now
for
a
while
not
while
isabel
is
like
this
he
said
i
could
not
i
must
go
away
for
a
while
and
then
come
back
and
ask
her
again
when
will
she
decide
she
told
me
by
next
easter
said
hubert
oh
aunt
margaret
pray
for
us
both
the
light
began
to
glimmer
again
in
her
eyes
there
dear
boy
she
said
you
see
you
believe
in
prayer
still
but
aunt
said
hubert
why
should
i
not
protestants
pray
well
well
said
the
old
nun
again
now
you
must
come
to
your
mother
and
and
be
good
to
her
chapter
v
the
coming
of
the
jesuits
the
effect
on
anthony
of
buxton
conversation
was
very
considerable
he
had
managed
to
keep
his
temper
very
well
during
the
actual
interview
but
he
broke
out
alone
afterwards
at
first
with
an
angry
contempt
the
absurd
arrogance
of
the
man
made
him
furious
the
arrogance
that
had
puffed
away
england
and
its
ambitions
and
its
vigour
palpable
evidences
of
life
and
reality
and
further
of
god
blessing
in
favour
of
a
miserable
latin
nation
which
had
the
presumption
to
claim
the
possession
of
peter
chair
and
of
the
person
of
the
vicar
of
christ
test
it
said
the
young
man
to
himself
by
the
ancient
fathers
and
councils
that
dr
jewel
quoted
so
learnedly
and
the
preposterous
claim
crumbled
to
dust
test
it
yet
again
by
the
finger
of
providence
and
god
himself
proclaimed
that
the
pretensions
of
the
spiritual
kingdom
of
which
the
prisoner
in
the
cell
had
bragged
are
but
a
blasphemous
fable
and
anthony
reminded
himself
of
the
events
of
the
previous
year
three
great
assaults
had
been
made
by
the
papists
to
win
back
england
to
the
old
religion
william
allen
the
founder
of
douai
college
had
already
for
the
last
seven
or
eight
years
been
pouring
seminary
priests
into
england
and
over
a
hundred
and
twenty
were
at
work
among
their
countrymen
preparing
the
grand
attack
this
was
made
in
three
quarters
at
once
in
scotland
it
was
chiefly
political
and
anthony
thought
with
a
bitter
contempt
of
the
count
esm√©
stuart
who
was
supposed
to
be
an
emissary
of
the
jesuits
how
he
had
plotted
with
ecclesiastics
and
nobles
and
professed
protestantism
to
further
his
ends
and
of
all
the
stories
of
his
duplicity
and
told
round
the
fire
in
ireland
the
attempt
was
little
else
than
ludicrous
anthony
laughed
fiercely
to
himself
as
he
pictured
the
landing
of
the
treacherous
fools
at
dingle
of
sir
james
fitzmaurice
and
his
lady
very
wretched
and
giddy
after
their
voyage
and
the
barefooted
friars
and
sanders
and
the
banner
so
solemnly
consecrated
and
of
the
sands
of
smerwick
when
all
was
over
a
year
later
and
the
six
hundred
bodies
men
and
women
who
had
preferred
buxton
spiritual
kingdom
to
elizabeth
kindly
rule
stripped
and
laid
out
in
rows
like
dead
game
for
lord
grey
de
wilton
to
reckon
them
by
but
his
heart
sank
a
little
as
he
remembered
the
third
method
of
attack
and
of
the
coming
of
the
jesuits
by
last
july
all
london
knew
that
they
were
here
and
men
hearts
were
shaken
with
apprehension
they
reminded
one
another
of
the
april
earthquake
that
had
tolled
the
great
westminster
bell
and
thrown
down
stones
from
the
churches
one
of
the
lambeth
guards
a
native
of
blunsdon
in
wiltshire
had
told
anthony
himself
that
a
pack
of
had
been
heard
there
in
full
cry
after
a
ghostly
quarry
phantom
ships
had
been
seen
from
bodmin
attacking
a
phantom
castle
that
rode
over
the
waves
off
the
cornish
coast
an
old
woman
of
blasedon
had
given
birth
to
a
monster
with
the
mouth
of
a
mouse
eight
legs
and
a
tail
and
worse
than
all
it
was
whispered
in
the
somersetshire
inns
that
three
companies
of
men
sixty
in
number
had
been
seen
coming
and
going
overhead
in
the
gloom
these
two
strange
emissaries
fathers
persons
and
campion
how
they
appealed
to
the
imagination
lurking
under
a
hundred
disguises
now
of
servants
now
of
gentlemen
of
means
and
position
it
was
known
that
they
were
still
in
england
going
about
doing
good
their
friends
said
who
knew
them
stirring
up
the
people
their
enemies
said
who
were
searching
for
them
anthony
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
some
of
the
papers
connected
with
their
presence
that
containing
a
statement
of
their
objects
in
coming
namely
that
they
were
spiritual
not
political
agents
seeking
recruits
for
christ
and
for
none
else
campion
challenge
and
brag
offering
to
meet
any
english
divine
on
equal
terms
in
a
public
disputation
besides
one
or
two
of
the
controversial
pamphlets
purporting
to
be
printed
at
douai
but
really
emanating
from
a
private
in
england
as
the
government
experts
had
discovered
from
an
examination
of
the
of
the
paper
employed
yet
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
his
first
resentment
cooled
arguments
more
and
more
sank
home
for
they
had
touched
the
very
point
where
anthony
had
reckoned
that
his
own
strength
lay
he
had
never
before
heard
nationalism
and
catholicism
placed
in
such
flat
antithesis
in
fact
he
had
never
before
really
heard
the
statement
of
the
catholic
position
and
his
fierce
contempt
gradually
melted
into
respect
both
theories
had
a
concrete
air
of
reality
about
them
his
own
imaged
itself
under
the
symbols
of
england
power
the
national
church
appealed
to
him
so
far
as
it
represented
the
spiritual
side
of
the
english
people
and
buxton
conception
appealed
to
him
from
its
very
audacity
this
great
spiritual
kingdom
striding
on
its
way
trampling
down
the
barriers
of
temperament
and
nationality
disregarding
all
earthly
limitations
and
artificial
restraints
imperiously
dominating
the
world
in
spite
of
the
world
struggles
and
resentment
this
after
all
as
he
thought
over
it
was
well
was
a
new
aspect
of
affairs
the
coming
of
the
jesuits
too
emphasised
the
appeal
here
were
two
men
as
the
world
itself
confessed
of
exceptional
ability
for
campion
had
been
a
famous
oxford
orator
and
persons
a
fellow
of
balliol
choosing
under
a
obedience
first
a
life
of
exile
and
then
one
of
daily
peril
and
apprehension
the
very
thought
of
which
burdened
the
imagination
with
horror
hunted
like
vermin
sleeping
and
faring
hard
their
very
names
detested
by
the
majority
of
their
countrymen
with
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
moving
with
them
and
the
reek
of
the
hangman
cauldron
continually
in
their
nostrils
and
for
what
for
buxton
spiritual
kingdom
well
anthony
thought
to
himself
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
his
new
thoughts
sank
deeper
if
it
is
all
a
superstitious
dream
at
least
it
is
a
noble
one
what
too
was
the
answer
he
asked
himself
that
england
gave
to
father
campion
challenge
and
the
defence
that
the
government
was
preparing
against
the
spiritual
weapons
of
the
jesuits
new
prisons
at
framingham
and
battersea
new
penalties
enacted
by
parliament
and
above
all
the
unanswerable
argument
of
the
rack
and
the
gallows
finally
to
close
the
discussion
and
what
of
the
army
that
was
being
set
in
array
against
the
priests
and
that
was
even
now
beginning
to
scour
the
country
round
berkshire
oxfordshire
and
london
anthony
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
they
were
queer
allies
for
the
servants
of
christ
for
traitors
liars
and
informers
were
among
the
most
trusted
government
agents
in
short
as
the
spring
drew
on
anthony
was
not
wholly
happy
again
and
again
in
his
own
room
he
studied
a
little
manuscript
translation
of
father
campion
ten
reasons
that
had
been
taken
from
a
popish
prisoner
and
that
a
friend
had
given
him
and
as
he
read
its
exultant
rhetoric
he
wondered
whether
the
writer
was
indeed
as
insincere
and
treacherous
as
scot
declared
there
seemed
in
the
paper
a
reckless
outspokenness
calculated
rather
to
irritate
than
deceive
i
turn
to
the
sacraments
he
read
none
none
not
two
not
one
o
holy
christ
have
they
left
their
very
bread
is
poison
their
baptism
though
it
be
true
yet
in
their
judgment
is
nothing
it
is
not
the
saving
water
it
is
not
the
channel
of
grace
it
brings
not
christ
merits
to
us
it
is
but
a
sign
of
salvation
and
again
the
writer
cried
to
elizabeth
to
return
to
the
ancient
religion
and
to
be
in
truth
what
she
was
in
name
the
defender
of
the
faith
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
thus
isaiah
sang
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
listen
elizabeth
most
mighty
queen
to
thee
the
great
prophet
sings
he
teaches
thee
thy
part
join
then
thyself
to
these
princes
o
elizabeth
a
day
a
day
shall
come
that
shall
show
thee
clearly
which
have
loved
thee
the
better
the
society
of
jesus
or
brood
what
arrogance
thought
anthony
to
himself
and
what
assurance
too
meanwhile
in
the
outer
world
things
were
not
reassuring
to
the
friends
of
the
government
it
was
true
that
half
a
dozen
priests
had
been
captured
and
examined
by
torture
and
that
sir
george
peckham
himself
who
was
known
to
have
harboured
campion
had
been
committed
to
the
marshalsea
but
yet
the
jesuits
influence
was
steadily
on
the
increase
more
and
more
severe
penalties
had
been
lately
enacted
it
was
now
declared
to
be
high
treason
to
reconcile
or
be
reconciled
to
the
church
of
rome
overwhelming
losses
in
fortune
as
well
as
liberty
were
threatened
against
all
who
said
or
heard
mass
or
refused
to
attend
the
services
of
the
establishment
but
as
was
discovered
from
papers
that
fell
from
time
to
time
into
the
hands
of
the
government
agents
the
only
answer
of
the
priests
was
to
inveigh
more
strenuously
against
even
occasional
conformity
declaring
it
to
be
the
mortal
sin
of
schism
if
not
of
apostasy
to
put
in
an
appearance
under
any
circumstances
except
those
of
actual
physical
compulsion
at
the
worship
in
the
parish
churches
worse
than
all
too
was
the
fact
that
this
severe
gospel
began
to
prevail
recusancy
was
reported
to
be
on
the
increase
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
many
of
the
old
aristocracy
began
to
return
to
the
faith
of
their
fathers
lords
arundel
oxford
vaux
henry
howard
and
sir
francis
southwell
were
all
beginning
to
fall
under
the
suspicion
of
the
shrewdest
government
spies
the
excitement
at
lambeth
ran
higher
day
by
day
as
the
summer
drew
on
the
net
was
being
gradually
contracted
in
the
home
counties
spies
were
reported
to
be
everywhere
in
inns
in
the
servants
quarters
of
gentlemen
houses
lounging
at
cross
roads
and
on
village
greens
campion
name
was
in
every
mouth
now
they
were
on
his
footsteps
it
was
said
now
he
was
taken
now
he
was
gone
back
to
france
now
he
was
in
london
now
in
lancashire
and
each
rumour
in
turn
corrected
its
predecessor
anthony
shared
to
the
full
in
the
excitement
the
figure
of
the
quarry
after
which
so
many
hawks
were
abroad
appealed
to
his
imagination
he
dreamed
of
him
at
night
once
as
a
man
with
narrow
eyes
and
stooping
shoulders
that
skulked
and
ran
from
shadow
to
shadow
across
a
moonlit
country
once
as
a
gentleman
riding
down
a
crowded
street
and
several
times
as
a
kind
of
double
of
stewart
whom
he
had
never
forgotten
since
he
had
watched
him
in
the
little
room
of
maxwell
hall
gallant
and
alert
among
his
enemies
at
last
one
day
in
july
as
it
drew
on
towards
evening
and
as
anthony
was
looking
over
the
in
his
little
office
beyond
the
presence
chamber
a
buzz
of
talk
and
footsteps
broke
out
in
the
court
below
and
a
moment
later
the
archbishop
ran
in
to
say
that
his
grace
wished
to
see
norris
at
once
in
the
gallery
that
opened
out
of
the
and
i
think
it
is
about
the
jesuits
sir
added
the
man
evidently
excited
anthony
ran
down
at
once
and
found
his
master
pacing
up
and
down
with
a
courier
waiting
near
the
steps
at
the
lower
end
that
led
to
tower
the
archbishop
stopped
by
a
window
emblazoned
with
cardinal
pole
emblem
and
beckoned
to
him
see
here
master
norris
he
said
i
have
received
news
that
campion
is
at
last
taken
it
may
well
be
false
as
so
often
before
but
take
horse
if
you
please
and
ride
into
the
city
and
find
the
truth
for
me
i
will
not
send
a
groom
they
believe
the
maddest
tales
you
are
at
liberty
he
added
courteously
yes
your
grace
i
will
ride
immediately
as
he
rode
down
the
towards
london
bridge
ten
minutes
later
he
could
not
help
feeling
some
dismay
as
well
as
excitement
at
the
news
he
was
to
verify
and
yet
what
other
end
was
possible
but
what
a
doom
for
the
brilliant
oxford
orator
even
though
he
had
counted
the
cost
streams
of
excited
people
were
pouring
across
the
bridge
into
the
city
campion
name
was
on
every
tongue
and
anthony
as
he
passed
under
the
high
gate
noticed
a
man
point
up
at
the
grim
spiked
heads
above
it
and
laugh
to
his
companion
there
seemed
little
doubt
from
the
unanimity
of
those
whom
he
questioned
that
the
rumour
was
true
and
some
even
said
that
the
jesuit
was
actually
passing
down
cheapside
on
his
way
to
the
tower
when
at
last
anthony
came
to
the
thoroughfare
the
crowd
was
as
dense
as
for
a
royal
progress
he
checked
his
horse
at
the
door
of
an
and
asked
an
ostler
that
stood
there
what
it
was
all
about
it
is
campion
the
jesuit
sir
said
the
man
he
has
been
taken
at
lyford
and
is
passing
here
presently
the
man
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
a
yell
came
from
the
end
of
the
street
and
groans
and
hoots
ran
down
the
crowd
anthony
turned
in
his
saddle
and
saw
a
great
stir
and
movement
and
then
horses
and
heads
moving
slowly
down
over
the
seething
surface
of
the
crowd
as
if
swimming
in
a
rough
sea
he
could
make
little
out
as
the
company
came
towards
him
but
the
faces
of
the
officers
and
pursuivants
who
rode
in
the
front
rank
four
or
five
abreast
then
followed
the
faces
of
three
or
four
others
also
riding
between
guards
and
anthony
looked
eagerly
at
them
but
they
were
simple
faces
enough
a
little
pale
and
quiet
one
was
like
a
farmer
ruddy
and
bearded
surely
campion
could
not
be
among
those
then
more
and
more
riding
two
and
two
with
a
couple
of
armed
guards
with
each
pair
some
looked
like
or
servants
some
like
gentlemen
and
one
or
two
might
be
priests
but
the
crowd
seemed
to
pay
them
no
attention
beyond
a
glance
or
two
ah
what
was
this
coming
behind
there
was
a
space
behind
the
last
row
of
guards
and
then
came
a
separate
troop
riding
all
together
of
half
a
dozen
men
at
least
and
one
in
the
centre
with
something
white
in
his
hat
the
ferment
round
this
group
was
tremendous
men
were
leaping
up
and
yelling
like
hounds
round
a
carted
stag
clubs
shot
up
menacingly
and
a
storm
of
ceaseless
execration
raged
outside
the
compact
square
of
guards
who
sat
alert
and
ready
to
beat
off
an
attack
once
a
horse
kicked
fiercely
as
a
man
sprang
to
his
and
there
was
a
scream
of
pain
and
a
burst
of
laughing
anthony
sat
trembling
with
excitement
as
the
first
group
had
passed
and
this
second
began
to
come
opposite
the
entrance
where
he
sat
this
then
was
the
man
the
rider
in
the
centre
sat
his
horse
somewhat
stiffly
and
anthony
saw
that
his
elbows
were
bound
behind
his
back
and
his
hands
in
front
the
reins
were
drawn
over
his
horse
head
and
a
pursuivant
held
them
on
either
side
the
man
was
dressed
as
a
layman
in
a
plumed
hat
and
a
buff
jerkin
such
as
soldiers
or
plain
might
use
and
in
the
hat
was
a
great
paper
with
an
inscription
anthony
spelt
it
out
campion
the
seditious
jesuit
then
he
looked
at
the
man
face
it
was
a
comely
refined
face
a
little
pale
but
perfectly
serene
his
pointed
dark
brown
beard
and
moustache
were
carefully
trimmed
and
his
large
passionate
eyes
looked
cheerfully
about
him
anthony
stared
at
him
wholly
fascinated
for
above
the
romance
that
hung
about
the
hunted
priest
and
the
glamour
of
the
dreaded
society
which
he
represented
there
was
a
chivalrous
fearless
look
in
his
face
that
drew
the
heart
of
the
young
man
almost
irresistibly
at
least
he
did
not
look
like
the
skulking
knave
at
whom
all
the
world
was
sneering
and
of
whom
anthony
had
dreamt
so
vividly
a
few
nights
before
the
storm
of
execration
from
the
faces
below
and
the
faces
crowding
at
the
windows
seemed
to
affect
him
not
at
all
and
he
looked
from
side
to
side
as
if
they
were
cheering
him
rather
than
crying
against
him
once
his
eyes
met
anthony
and
rested
on
them
for
a
moment
and
a
strange
thrill
ran
through
him
and
he
shivered
sharply
and
yet
he
felt
too
a
distinct
and
irresistible
movement
of
attraction
towards
this
felon
who
was
riding
towards
his
agony
and
passion
and
he
was
conscious
at
the
same
time
of
that
curious
touch
of
wonder
that
he
had
felt
years
before
towards
the
man
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
as
to
whether
the
solitary
criminal
were
not
in
the
right
and
the
clamorous
accusers
in
the
wrong
campion
in
a
moment
had
passed
on
and
turned
his
head
in
that
moment
too
anthony
caught
a
sudden
clear
instantaneous
impression
of
a
group
of
faces
in
the
window
opposite
there
were
a
couple
of
men
in
front
stout
city
personages
no
doubt
with
crimson
faces
and
open
mouths
cursing
the
traitorous
papist
and
the
crafty
vagrant
fox
trapped
at
last
but
between
them
looking
over
their
shoulders
was
a
woman
face
in
which
anthony
saw
the
most
intense
struggle
of
emotions
the
face
was
quite
white
the
lips
parted
the
eyes
straining
and
sorrow
and
compassion
were
in
every
line
as
she
watched
the
cheerful
priest
among
his
warders
and
yet
there
rested
on
it
too
a
strange
light
as
of
triumph
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
sees
victory
even
at
the
hour
of
supremest
failure
in
an
instant
more
the
face
had
withdrawn
itself
into
the
darkness
of
the
room
when
the
crowds
had
surged
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
yelling
in
derision
as
campion
saluted
the
lately
defaced
cheapside
cross
anthony
guided
his
horse
out
through
the
dispersing
groups
realising
as
he
did
so
with
a
touch
of
astonishment
at
the
coincidence
that
he
had
been
standing
almost
immediately
under
the
window
whence
he
and
isabel
had
leaned
out
so
many
years
before
the
sun
was
going
down
behind
the
abbey
as
he
rode
up
towards
lambeth
and
the
sky
above
and
the
river
beneath
were
as
molten
gold
the
abbey
itself
with
westminster
hall
and
the
houses
of
parliament
below
stood
up
like
mystical
palaces
against
the
sunset
and
it
seemed
to
anthony
as
he
rode
as
if
god
himself
were
illustrating
in
glorious
illumination
the
closing
pages
of
that
human
life
of
which
a
glimpse
had
opened
to
him
in
cheapside
it
did
not
appear
to
him
as
it
had
done
in
the
days
of
his
boyish
love
as
if
heaven
and
earth
were
a
stage
for
himself
to
walk
and
pose
upon
but
he
felt
intensely
now
the
dominating
power
of
the
personality
of
the
priest
and
that
he
himself
was
no
more
than
a
spectator
of
this
act
of
a
tragedy
of
which
the
priest
was
both
hero
and
victim
and
for
which
this
evening
glory
formed
so
radiant
a
scene
the
old
intellectual
arguments
against
the
cause
that
the
priest
represented
for
the
moment
were
drowned
in
this
flood
of
splendour
when
he
arrived
at
lambeth
and
had
reached
the
archbishop
presence
he
told
him
the
news
briefly
and
went
to
his
room
full
of
thought
and
perplexity
in
a
few
days
the
story
of
campion
arrest
was
known
far
and
wide
it
had
been
made
possible
by
the
folly
of
one
catholic
and
the
treachery
of
another
and
when
anthony
heard
it
he
was
stirred
still
more
by
the
contrast
between
the
jesuit
and
his
pursuers
the
priest
had
returned
to
the
moated
grange
at
lyford
after
having
already
paid
as
long
a
visit
there
as
was
prudent
owing
to
the
solicitations
of
a
number
of
gentlemen
who
had
ridden
after
him
and
his
companion
and
who
wished
to
hear
his
eloquence
he
had
returned
there
again
said
mass
on
the
sunday
morning
and
preached
afterwards
from
a
chair
set
before
the
altar
a
sermon
on
the
tears
of
the
saviour
over
apostate
jerusalem
but
a
false
disciple
had
been
present
who
had
come
in
search
of
one
payne
and
this
man
known
afterwards
by
the
catholics
as
judas
eliot
or
eliot
iscariot
had
gathered
a
number
of
constables
and
placed
them
about
the
and
before
the
sermon
was
over
he
went
out
quickly
from
the
table
of
the
lord
the
house
was
immediately
surrounded
and
the
alarm
was
raised
by
a
watcher
placed
in
one
of
the
turrets
after
eliot
suspicious
departure
the
three
priests
present
campion
and
two
others
were
hurried
into
a
over
the
stairs
the
officers
entered
searched
and
found
nothing
and
were
actually
retiring
when
eliot
succeeded
in
persuading
them
to
try
again
they
searched
again
till
dark
and
still
found
nothing
yate
encouraged
them
to
stay
the
night
in
the
house
and
entertained
them
with
ale
and
then
when
all
was
quiet
insisted
on
hearing
some
parting
words
from
her
eloquent
guest
he
came
out
into
the
room
where
she
had
chosen
to
spend
the
night
until
the
officers
were
gone
and
the
rest
of
the
catholics
some
brigittine
nuns
and
others
met
there
through
private
passages
and
listened
to
him
for
the
last
time
as
the
company
was
dispersing
one
of
the
priests
stumbled
and
fell
making
a
noise
that
roused
the
sentry
outside
again
the
house
was
searched
and
again
with
no
success
in
despair
they
were
leaving
it
when
jenkins
eliot
companion
who
was
coming
downstairs
with
a
servant
of
the
house
beat
with
his
stick
on
the
wall
saying
that
they
had
not
searched
there
it
was
noticed
that
the
servant
showed
signs
of
agitation
and
men
were
fetched
to
the
spot
the
wall
was
beaten
in
and
the
three
priests
were
found
together
having
mutually
shriven
one
another
and
made
themselves
ready
for
death
campion
was
taken
out
and
sent
first
to
the
sheriff
of
berkshire
and
then
on
towards
london
on
the
following
day
the
summer
days
went
by
and
every
day
brought
its
fresh
rumour
about
campion
sir
owen
hopton
governor
of
the
tower
who
at
first
had
committed
his
prisoner
to
now
began
to
treat
him
with
more
honour
he
talked
too
mysteriously
of
secret
interviews
and
promises
and
understandings
and
gradually
it
began
to
get
about
that
campion
was
yielding
to
kindness
that
he
had
seen
the
queen
that
he
was
to
recant
at
paul
cross
and
even
that
he
was
to
have
the
see
of
canterbury
this
last
rumour
caused
great
indignation
at
lambeth
and
anthony
was
more
pressed
than
ever
to
get
what
authentic
news
he
could
of
the
jesuit
then
at
the
beginning
of
august
came
a
burst
of
new
tales
he
had
been
racked
it
was
said
and
had
given
up
a
number
of
names
and
as
the
month
went
by
more
and
more
details
authentic
and
otherwise
were
published
those
favourably
inclined
to
the
catholics
were
divided
in
opinion
some
feared
that
he
had
indeed
yielded
to
an
excess
of
agony
others
and
these
proved
to
be
in
the
right
when
the
truth
came
out
that
he
had
only
given
up
names
which
were
already
known
to
the
authorities
though
even
for
this
he
asked
public
pardon
on
the
scaffold
towards
the
end
of
august
the
archbishop
again
sent
expressly
for
anthony
and
bade
him
accompany
his
chaplain
on
the
following
day
to
the
tower
to
be
present
at
the
public
disputation
that
was
to
take
place
between
english
divines
and
the
jesuit
now
he
will
have
the
chance
he
craved
for
said
grindal
he
hath
bragged
that
he
would
meet
any
and
all
in
dispute
and
now
the
clemency
hath
granted
it
him
on
the
following
day
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
the
minister
and
anthony
rode
down
together
to
the
tower
where
they
arrived
a
few
minutes
before
eight
and
were
passed
through
up
the
stairs
into
john
chapel
to
the
seats
reserved
for
them
it
was
indeed
true
that
the
authorities
had
determined
to
give
campion
his
chance
but
they
had
also
determined
to
make
it
as
small
as
possible
he
was
not
even
told
that
the
discussion
was
to
take
place
until
the
morning
of
its
occasion
and
he
was
allowed
no
opportunity
for
developing
his
own
theological
position
the
entire
conduct
of
the
debate
was
in
the
hands
of
his
adversaries
he
might
only
parry
seldom
riposte
and
never
attack
when
anthony
found
himself
in
his
seat
he
looked
round
the
chapel
almost
immediately
opposite
him
on
a
raised
platform
against
a
pillar
stood
two
high
seats
occupied
by
deans
nowell
and
day
who
were
to
conduct
the
disputation
and
who
were
now
talking
with
their
heads
together
while
a
secretary
was
arranging
a
great
heap
of
books
on
the
table
before
them
on
either
side
east
and
west
stretched
chairs
for
the
divines
that
were
to
support
them
in
debate
should
they
need
it
and
the
platform
on
which
anthony
himself
had
a
chair
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
clergy
and
courtiers
laughing
and
chatting
together
a
little
table
also
heaped
with
books
with
seats
for
the
notaries
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
nave
and
not
far
from
it
were
a
number
of
little
wooden
stools
which
the
prisoners
were
to
occupy
plainly
they
were
to
be
allowed
no
advisers
and
no
books
even
the
physical
support
of
table
and
chairs
was
denied
to
them
in
spite
of
their
weary
racked
bodies
the
chapel
bright
with
the
morning
sunlight
that
streamed
in
through
the
east
windows
of
the
bare
norman
sanctuary
hummed
with
the
talk
and
laughter
of
those
who
had
come
to
see
the
and
the
vindication
of
the
protestant
religion
though
as
anthony
looked
round
he
saw
here
and
there
an
anxious
or
a
downcast
face
of
some
unknown
friend
of
the
papists
he
himself
was
far
from
easy
in
his
mind
he
had
been
studying
ten
reasons
more
earnestly
than
ever
and
was
amazed
to
find
that
the
very
authorities
to
which
dr
jewel
deferred
namely
the
scriptures
interpreted
by
fathers
and
councils
and
illustrated
by
history
were
exactly
campion
authorities
too
and
that
the
jesuit
appeal
to
them
was
no
less
confident
than
the
protestant
that
fact
had
of
course
suggested
the
thought
that
if
there
were
no
further
living
authority
in
existence
to
decide
between
these
two
scholars
christendom
was
in
a
poor
position
when
doctors
differed
where
was
the
layman
to
turn
to
his
own
private
judgment
said
the
protestant
but
then
campion
private
judgment
led
him
to
submit
to
the
catholic
claim
this
then
at
present
weighed
heavily
on
anthony
mind
was
there
or
was
there
not
an
authority
on
earth
capable
of
declaring
to
him
the
revelation
of
god
for
the
first
time
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
logical
and
spiritual
necessity
for
an
infallible
external
judge
in
matters
of
faith
and
that
the
catholic
church
was
the
only
system
that
professed
to
supply
it
the
question
of
the
existence
of
such
an
authority
was
with
the
doctrine
of
justification
one
of
those
subjects
continually
in
men
minds
and
conversations
and
to
anthony
unlike
others
it
appeared
more
fundamental
even
than
its
companion
all
else
seemed
secondary
indulgences
the
mass
absolution
the
worship
of
mary
and
the
saints
all
these
must
stand
or
fall
on
god
authority
made
known
to
man
the
one
question
for
him
was
where
was
that
authority
to
be
certainly
found
there
came
the
ringing
tramp
of
footsteps
the
buzz
of
talk
ceased
and
then
broke
out
again
as
the
prisoners
with
all
eyes
bent
upon
them
surrounded
by
a
strong
guard
of
pikemen
were
seen
advancing
up
the
chapel
from
the
door
towards
the
stools
set
ready
for
them
anthony
had
no
eyes
but
for
campion
who
limped
in
front
supported
on
either
side
by
a
warder
he
could
scarcely
believe
at
first
that
this
was
the
same
priest
who
had
ridden
so
bravely
down
cheapside
now
he
was
bent
and
walked
like
an
old
broken
man
his
face
was
deathly
pale
with
shadows
and
lines
about
his
eyes
and
his
head
trembled
a
little
there
were
one
or
two
exclamations
of
pity
for
all
knew
what
had
caused
the
change
and
anthony
heard
an
undertone
moan
of
sorrow
and
anger
from
some
one
in
a
seat
behind
him
the
prisoners
sat
down
and
the
guards
went
to
their
places
campion
took
his
seat
in
front
and
turned
immediately
from
side
to
side
running
his
dark
eyes
along
the
faces
to
see
where
were
his
adversaries
and
once
more
anthony
met
his
eyes
and
thrilled
at
it
through
the
pallor
and
pain
of
his
face
the
same
chivalrous
spirit
looked
out
and
called
for
homage
and
love
that
years
ago
at
oxford
had
made
young
men
mockingly
nicknamed
after
their
leader
to
desire
his
praise
more
passionately
than
anything
on
earth
and
even
to
imitate
his
manners
and
dress
and
gait
for
very
loyalty
and
devotion
anthony
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
he
watched
the
profile
of
his
face
thrown
fearlessly
forward
waited
in
tense
expectation
to
hear
him
speak
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
whisperings
of
the
chaplain
beside
him
presently
the
debate
began
it
was
opened
by
dean
nowell
from
his
high
seat
who
assured
father
campion
of
the
disinterested
motives
of
himself
and
his
reverend
friends
in
holding
this
disputation
it
was
after
all
only
what
the
priest
had
demanded
and
they
trusted
by
god
grace
that
they
would
do
him
good
and
help
him
to
see
the
truth
there
was
no
unfairness
said
the
dean
who
seemed
to
think
that
some
apology
was
needed
in
taking
him
thus
unprepared
since
the
subject
of
debate
would
be
none
other
than
campion
own
book
the
jesuit
looked
up
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
i
thank
you
dean
he
said
in
his
deep
resonant
voice
and
there
fell
a
dead
hush
as
he
spoke
i
thank
you
for
desiring
to
do
me
good
and
to
take
up
my
challenge
but
i
must
say
that
i
would
i
had
understood
of
your
coming
that
i
might
have
made
myself
ready
campion
voice
thrilled
strangely
through
anthony
as
the
glance
from
his
eyes
had
done
it
was
so
assured
so
strong
and
delicate
an
instrument
and
so
supremely
at
its
owner
command
that
it
was
hardly
less
persuasive
than
his
personality
and
his
learning
that
made
themselves
apparent
during
the
day
and
anthony
was
not
alone
in
his
impressions
of
the
jesuit
lord
arundel
afterwards
attributed
his
conversion
to
campion
share
in
the
discussions
again
and
again
during
the
day
a
murmur
of
applause
followed
some
of
the
priest
speeches
and
arguments
and
a
murmur
of
disapproval
the
fierce
thrusts
and
taunts
of
his
opponents
and
by
the
end
of
the
day
debate
so
marked
was
the
change
of
attitude
of
the
crowd
that
had
come
to
triumph
over
the
papist
and
so
manifest
their
sympathy
with
the
prisoners
that
it
was
thought
advisable
to
exclude
the
public
from
the
subsequent
discussions
on
this
first
day
all
manner
of
subjects
were
touched
upon
such
as
the
comparative
leniency
of
catholic
and
protestant
governments
the
position
of
luther
with
regard
to
the
epistle
of
james
and
other
matters
comparatively
unimportant
in
the
discussion
of
which
a
great
deal
of
time
was
wasted
campion
entreated
his
opponents
to
leave
such
minor
questions
alone
and
to
come
to
doctrinal
matters
but
they
preferred
to
keep
to
details
rather
than
to
principles
and
the
priest
had
scarcely
any
opportunity
to
state
his
positive
position
at
all
the
only
doctrinal
matter
seriously
touched
upon
was
that
of
justification
by
faith
and
texts
were
flung
to
and
fro
without
any
great
result
we
are
justified
by
faith
cried
one
side
though
i
have
all
faith
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
cried
the
other
the
effect
on
anthony
of
this
debate
arose
rather
from
the
victorious
personality
of
the
priest
than
from
his
arguments
his
gaiety
too
was
in
strange
contrast
to
the
solemn
puritanism
of
his
enemies
for
instance
he
was
on
the
point
that
councils
might
err
in
matters
of
fact
but
that
the
scriptures
could
not
as
for
example
he
said
his
eyes
twinkling
out
of
his
drawn
face
i
am
bound
under
pain
of
damnation
to
believe
that
toby
dog
had
a
tail
because
it
is
written
he
wagged
it
the
deans
looked
sternly
at
him
as
the
audience
laughed
now
now
said
one
of
them
it
becomes
not
to
deal
so
triflingly
with
matters
of
weight
campion
dropped
his
eyes
demurely
as
if
reproved
why
then
he
said
if
this
example
like
you
not
take
another
i
must
believe
that
saint
paul
had
a
cloak
because
he
willeth
timothy
to
bring
it
with
him
again
the
crowd
laughed
and
anthony
laughed
too
with
a
strange
sob
in
his
throat
at
the
gallant
foolery
which
after
all
was
as
much
to
the
point
as
a
deal
that
the
deans
were
saying
but
the
second
day
debate
held
in
hopton
hall
was
on
more
vital
matters
and
anthony
again
and
again
found
himself
leaning
forward
breathlessly
as
drs
goode
and
fulke
on
the
one
side
and
campion
on
the
other
respectively
attacked
and
defended
the
doctrine
of
the
visible
church
for
this
for
anthony
was
one
of
the
crucial
points
of
the
dispute
between
catholicism
and
protestantism
anthony
believed
already
that
the
church
was
one
and
if
it
was
visible
surely
he
thought
to
himself
it
must
be
visibly
one
and
in
that
case
it
is
evident
where
that
church
is
to
be
found
but
if
it
is
invisible
it
may
be
invisibly
one
and
then
as
far
as
that
matter
is
concerned
he
may
rest
in
the
church
of
england
if
not
and
then
he
recoiled
from
the
gulf
that
opened
it
must
be
an
essential
mark
of
the
church
said
campion
and
such
a
quality
as
is
inseparable
it
must
be
visible
as
fire
is
hot
and
water
moist
goode
answered
that
when
christ
was
taken
and
the
apostles
fled
then
at
least
the
church
was
invisible
and
if
then
why
not
always
it
was
a
church
inchoate
answered
the
priest
beginning
not
perfect
but
goode
continued
to
insist
that
the
true
church
is
known
only
to
god
and
therefore
invisible
there
are
many
wolves
within
he
said
and
many
sheep
without
i
know
not
who
is
elect
retorted
campion
but
i
know
who
is
a
catholic
only
the
elect
are
of
the
church
said
goode
i
say
that
both
good
and
evil
are
of
the
visible
church
answered
the
other
to
be
elect
or
true
members
of
christ
is
one
thing
went
on
goode
and
to
be
in
the
visible
church
is
another
as
the
talk
went
on
anthony
began
to
see
where
the
confusion
lay
the
protestants
were
anxious
to
prove
that
membership
in
a
visible
body
did
not
ensure
salvation
but
then
the
catholics
never
claimed
that
it
did
the
question
was
did
or
did
not
christ
intend
there
to
be
a
visible
church
membership
in
which
should
be
the
normal
though
not
the
infallible
means
of
salvation
they
presently
got
on
to
the
point
as
to
whether
a
visible
church
would
seem
to
be
a
necessity
there
is
a
perpetual
commandment
said
the
priest
in
matthew
eighteen
the
church
but
that
can
not
be
unless
the
church
is
visible
the
visibility
of
the
church
is
continual
when
there
is
an
established
church
said
goode
this
remedy
is
to
be
sought
for
but
this
can
not
be
always
had
the
disease
is
continual
answered
campion
the
remedy
must
be
continual
then
he
left
the
ground
and
entered
theirs
to
whom
should
i
have
gone
he
cried
before
luther
time
what
prelates
should
i
have
made
my
complaint
unto
in
those
days
where
was
your
church
nine
hundred
years
ago
whose
were
john
huss
jerome
of
prague
the
waldenses
were
they
yours
then
he
turned
scornfully
to
fulke
help
him
master
doctor
and
fulke
repeated
goode
assertion
that
valuable
as
the
remedy
is
it
can
not
always
be
had
anthony
sat
back
puzzled
both
sides
seemed
right
persecution
must
often
hinder
the
full
privileges
of
church
membership
and
the
exercise
of
discipline
yet
the
question
was
what
was
christ
intention
was
it
that
the
church
should
be
visible
it
seemed
that
even
the
ministers
allowed
that
now
and
if
so
why
then
the
catholic
claim
that
intention
had
never
been
wholly
frustrated
but
that
a
visible
unity
was
to
be
found
amongst
themselves
surely
this
was
easier
to
believe
than
the
protestant
theory
that
the
church
which
had
been
visible
for
fifteen
centuries
was
not
really
the
church
at
all
but
that
the
true
church
had
been
invisible
in
spite
of
christ
intention
during
all
that
period
and
was
now
to
be
found
only
in
small
separated
bodies
scattered
here
and
there
how
of
the
prevailing
of
the
gates
of
hell
if
that
were
allowed
to
be
true
at
two
they
reassembled
for
the
afternoon
conference
and
now
they
got
even
closer
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
for
the
subject
was
to
be
whether
the
church
could
err
fulke
asserted
that
it
could
and
did
and
made
a
syllogism
whatsoever
error
is
incident
to
every
member
is
incident
to
the
whole
but
it
is
incident
to
every
member
to
err
to
the
whole
i
deny
both
and
said
campion
quietly
every
man
may
err
but
not
the
whole
gathered
together
for
the
whole
hath
a
promise
but
so
hath
not
every
particular
man
fulke
denied
this
stoutly
and
beat
on
the
table
every
member
hath
the
spirit
of
christ
he
said
which
is
the
spirit
of
truth
and
therefore
hath
the
same
promise
that
the
whole
hath
why
then
said
campion
smiling
there
should
be
no
heretics
yes
answered
fulke
heretics
may
be
within
the
church
but
not
of
the
church
and
so
they
found
themselves
back
again
where
they
started
from
anthony
sat
back
on
the
oak
bench
and
sighed
and
glanced
round
at
the
interested
faces
of
the
theologians
and
the
yawns
of
the
amateurs
as
the
debate
rolled
on
over
the
old
ground
and
touched
on
free
will
and
grace
and
infant
baptism
until
the
lieutenant
interposed
master
doctors
he
said
with
a
judicial
air
the
question
that
was
appointed
before
dinner
was
whether
the
visible
church
may
err
to
which
goode
retorted
that
the
digressions
were
all
campion
fault
then
the
debate
took
the
form
of
contradictions
whatsoever
congregation
doth
err
in
matters
of
faith
said
goode
is
not
the
true
church
but
the
church
of
rome
erreth
in
matters
of
faith
it
is
not
the
true
church
i
deny
your
said
campion
the
church
of
rome
hath
not
erred
then
the
same
process
was
repeated
over
the
council
of
trent
and
the
debate
whirled
off
once
more
into
details
and
irrelevancies
about
imputed
righteousness
and
the
denial
of
the
cup
to
the
laity
again
the
audience
grew
restless
they
had
not
come
there
most
of
them
to
listen
to
theological
minuti√¶
but
to
see
sport
and
this
interminable
chopping
of
words
that
resulted
in
nothing
bored
them
profoundly
a
murmur
of
conversation
began
to
buzz
on
all
sides
campion
was
in
despair
thus
shall
we
run
into
all
questions
he
cried
hopelessly
and
then
we
shall
have
done
this
time
twelve
months
but
fulke
would
not
let
him
be
but
pressed
on
a
question
about
the
council
of
nice
now
we
shall
have
the
matter
of
images
sighed
campion
you
are
retorted
fulke
you
will
leap
over
the
stile
or
ever
you
come
to
it
i
mean
not
to
speak
of
images
and
so
with
a
few
more
irrelevancies
the
debate
ended
the
third
debate
in
september
on
the
at
which
anthony
was
again
present
was
on
the
subject
of
the
real
presence
in
the
blessed
sacrament
fulke
was
in
an
evil
temper
since
it
was
common
talk
that
campion
had
had
the
best
of
the
argument
on
the
eighteenth
the
other
day
he
said
when
we
had
some
hope
of
your
conversion
we
forbare
you
much
and
suffered
you
to
discourse
but
now
that
we
see
you
are
an
obstinate
heretic
and
seek
to
cover
the
light
of
the
truth
with
multitude
of
words
we
mean
not
to
allow
you
such
large
discourses
as
we
did
you
are
very
imperious
answered
campion
serenely
whatsoever
the
matter
is
i
am
the
queen
prisoner
and
none
of
yours
not
a
whit
imperious
said
fulke
angrily
though
i
will
exact
of
you
to
keep
the
right
order
of
disputation
then
the
argument
began
it
soon
became
plain
to
anthony
that
it
was
possible
to
take
the
scripture
in
two
senses
literally
and
metaphorically
the
sacrament
either
was
literally
christ
body
or
it
was
not
who
then
was
to
decide
father
campion
said
it
meant
the
one
fulke
the
other
could
it
be
possible
that
christ
should
leave
his
people
in
doubt
as
to
such
a
thing
surely
not
thought
anthony
well
then
where
is
the
arbiter
father
campion
says
the
church
fulke
says
the
scripture
but
that
is
a
circular
argument
for
the
question
to
be
decided
is
what
does
the
scripture
mean
for
it
may
mean
at
least
two
things
at
least
so
it
would
seem
here
then
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
claims
of
the
church
of
rome
to
be
that
arbiter
and
his
heart
began
to
grow
sick
with
apprehension
as
he
saw
how
that
church
supplied
exactly
what
was
demanded
by
the
circumstances
of
the
case
that
is
an
infallible
living
guide
as
to
the
meaning
of
god
revelation
the
simplicity
of
her
claim
appalled
him
he
did
not
follow
the
argument
closely
since
it
seemed
to
him
but
a
secondary
question
now
though
he
heard
one
or
two
sentences
at
one
point
campion
was
explaining
what
the
church
meant
by
substance
it
was
that
which
transcended
the
senses
are
you
not
dr
fulke
he
said
and
yet
i
see
nothing
but
your
colour
and
exterior
form
the
substance
of
fulke
can
not
be
seen
i
will
not
vouchsafe
to
reply
upon
this
answer
snarled
fulke
whose
temper
had
not
been
improved
by
the
debate
too
childish
for
a
sophister
then
followed
interminable
syllogisms
of
which
campion
would
not
accept
the
premises
and
no
real
progress
was
made
the
jesuit
tried
to
explain
the
doctrine
that
the
wicked
may
be
said
not
to
eat
the
body
in
the
sacrament
because
they
receive
not
the
virtue
of
it
though
they
receive
the
thing
but
fulke
would
not
hear
him
the
distinction
was
new
to
anthony
with
his
puritan
training
and
he
sat
pondering
it
while
the
debate
passed
on
the
afternoon
discussion
too
was
to
little
purpose
more
and
more
anthony
and
others
with
him
began
to
see
that
the
heart
of
the
matter
was
the
authority
of
the
church
and
that
unless
that
was
settled
all
other
debate
was
beside
the
point
and
the
importance
of
this
was
brought
out
for
him
more
clearly
than
ever
on
the
of
the
month
when
the
fourth
and
last
debate
took
place
and
on
the
subject
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
scriptures
unto
salvation
charke
who
had
now
succeeded
as
disputant
began
with
extempore
prayer
in
which
as
usual
the
priest
refused
to
join
praying
and
crossing
himself
apart
walker
then
opened
the
disputation
with
a
pompous
and
insolent
speech
about
one
campion
an
unnatural
man
to
his
country
degenerated
from
an
englishman
an
apostate
in
religion
a
fugitive
from
this
realm
unloyal
to
his
prince
campion
sat
with
his
eyes
cast
down
until
the
minister
had
done
then
the
discussion
began
the
priest
pointed
out
that
protestants
were
not
even
decided
as
to
what
were
scriptures
and
what
were
not
since
luther
rejected
three
epistles
in
the
new
testament
therefore
he
argued
the
church
is
necessary
as
a
guide
first
of
all
to
tell
men
what
is
scripture
walker
evaded
by
saying
he
was
not
a
lutheran
but
a
christian
and
then
the
talk
turned
on
to
apocryphal
books
but
it
was
not
possible
to
evade
long
and
the
jesuit
soon
touched
his
opponent
to
leave
a
door
to
traditions
he
said
which
the
holy
ghost
may
deliver
to
the
true
church
is
both
manifest
and
seen
as
in
the
baptism
of
infants
the
holy
ghost
proceeding
from
father
to
son
and
such
other
things
mentioned
which
are
delivered
by
tradition
prove
these
directly
by
the
scripture
if
you
can
charke
answered
by
the
analogy
of
circumcision
which
infants
received
and
by
quoting
christ
words
as
to
sending
of
the
comforter
and
they
were
soon
deep
in
detailed
argument
but
once
more
anthony
saw
that
it
was
all
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
scripture
and
therefore
that
it
would
seem
that
an
authoritative
interpreter
was
necessary
and
where
could
such
be
found
save
in
an
infallible
living
voice
and
once
more
a
question
of
campion
drove
the
point
home
was
all
scripture
written
when
the
apostles
first
taught
and
charke
dared
not
answer
yes
the
afternoon
debate
concerned
justification
by
faith
and
this
more
than
ever
seemed
to
anthony
a
secondary
matter
now
that
he
was
realising
what
the
claim
of
a
living
authority
meant
and
he
sat
back
only
interested
in
watching
the
priest
face
so
controlled
yet
so
transparent
in
its
simplicity
and
steadfastness
as
he
listened
to
the
ministers
brutal
taunts
and
insolence
and
dealt
his
quiet
skilful
parries
and
ripostes
to
their
incessant
assaults
at
last
the
lieutenant
struck
the
table
with
his
hand
and
intimated
that
the
time
was
past
and
after
a
long
prayer
by
walker
the
prisoners
were
led
back
to
their
cells
as
anthony
rode
back
alone
in
the
evening
sunlight
he
was
as
one
who
was
seeing
a
vision
there
was
indeed
a
vision
before
him
that
had
been
taking
shape
gradually
detail
by
detail
during
these
last
months
and
ousting
the
old
one
and
which
now
terribly
emphasised
by
arguments
and
illuminated
by
the
fire
of
his
personality
towered
up
imperious
consistent
dominating
and
across
her
brow
her
title
the
catholic
church
far
above
all
the
melting
cloudland
of
theory
she
moved
a
stupendous
fact
living
in
contrast
with
the
dead
past
to
which
her
enemies
cried
in
vain
eloquent
when
other
systems
were
dumb
authoritative
when
they
hesitated
steady
when
they
reeled
and
fell
about
her
throne
dwelt
her
children
from
every
race
and
age
secure
in
her
protection
and
wise
with
her
knowledge
when
other
men
faltered
and
questioned
and
doubted
and
as
anthony
looked
up
and
saw
her
for
the
first
time
he
recognised
her
as
the
mistress
and
mother
of
his
soul
and
although
the
blinding
clouds
of
argument
and
theory
and
rushed
down
on
him
again
and
filled
his
eyes
with
dust
yet
he
knew
he
had
seen
her
face
in
very
truth
and
that
the
memory
of
that
vision
could
never
again
wholly
leave
him
chapter
vi
some
contrasts
in
the
lambeth
household
the
autumn
passed
by
uneventfully
the
rigour
of
the
archbishop
confinement
had
been
mitigated
and
he
had
been
allowed
now
and
again
to
visit
his
palace
at
croydon
but
his
inactivity
still
continued
as
the
sequestration
was
not
removed
elizabeth
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
petition
of
convocation
in
for
his
reinstatement
anthony
went
down
to
the
old
palace
once
or
twice
with
him
and
was
brought
closer
to
him
in
many
ways
and
his
affection
and
tenderness
towards
his
master
continually
increased
grindal
was
a
pathetic
figure
at
this
time
with
few
friends
in
poor
health
out
of
favour
with
the
queen
who
had
disregarded
his
existence
and
now
his
afflictions
were
rendered
more
heavy
than
ever
by
the
blindness
that
was
creeping
over
him
the
archbishop
too
in
his
loneliness
and
sorrow
was
drawn
closer
to
his
young
officer
than
ever
before
and
gradually
got
to
rely
upon
him
in
many
little
ways
he
would
often
walk
with
anthony
in
the
gardens
at
lambeth
leaning
upon
his
arm
talking
to
him
of
his
beloved
flowers
and
herbs
which
he
was
now
almost
too
blind
to
see
telling
him
queer
facts
about
the
properties
of
plants
and
even
attempting
to
teach
him
a
little
irrelevant
botany
now
and
then
they
were
walking
up
and
down
together
soon
after
campion
arrest
one
august
morning
before
prayers
in
a
little
walled
garden
on
the
river
that
grindal
had
laid
out
with
great
care
in
earlier
years
ah
said
the
old
man
i
am
too
blind
to
see
my
flowers
now
norris
but
i
love
them
none
the
less
and
i
know
their
places
now
there
he
went
on
pointing
with
his
stick
there
i
think
grows
my
mastick
or
marum
perhaps
i
smell
it
however
what
is
that
flower
like
mr
norris
anthony
looked
at
it
and
described
its
little
white
flower
and
its
leaves
that
is
it
said
the
archbishop
i
thought
my
memory
served
me
it
is
a
kind
of
marjoram
and
it
has
many
virtues
against
cramps
convulsions
and
venomous
bites
so
galen
tells
us
then
he
went
on
to
talk
of
the
simple
old
plants
that
he
loved
best
of
the
two
kinds
of
basil
that
he
always
had
in
his
garden
and
how
good
it
was
mixed
in
sack
against
the
headache
and
the
male
and
how
well
it
had
served
him
once
when
he
had
great
internal
trouble
gerrard
was
here
a
week
or
two
ago
norris
when
you
were
down
at
croydon
for
me
he
is
my
lord
burghley
man
he
oversees
his
gardens
at
wimbledon
house
and
in
the
country
he
was
telling
me
of
a
rascal
he
had
seen
at
a
fair
who
burned
henbane
and
made
folks
with
the
toothache
breathe
in
the
fumes
and
then
feigned
to
draw
a
worm
forth
from
the
aching
tooth
but
it
was
no
worm
at
all
but
a
lute
string
that
he
held
ready
in
his
hand
there
are
sad
rascals
abroad
mr
norris
the
old
man
waxed
eloquent
when
they
came
to
the
iris
bed
ah
norris
the
are
over
by
now
i
fear
but
what
wonderful
creatures
of
god
they
are
with
their
great
handsome
heads
and
their
cool
flags
i
love
to
hear
a
bed
of
them
rustle
all
together
and
shake
their
spears
and
nod
their
banners
like
an
army
in
array
and
then
they
are
not
only
for
show
apuleius
says
that
they
are
good
against
the
gout
i
asked
gerrard
whether
my
lord
had
tried
them
but
he
said
no
he
would
not
at
the
violet
bed
he
was
yet
more
emphatic
i
think
norris
i
love
these
the
best
of
all
they
are
lowly
creatures
but
how
sweet
and
like
other
lowly
creatures
exalted
by
their
maker
to
do
great
things
as
his
handmaidens
the
leaves
are
good
against
inflammations
and
the
flowers
against
ague
and
hoarseness
as
well
and
then
there
is
as
you
know
and
and
then
they
are
good
for
blisters
garlands
of
them
were
an
ancient
cure
for
the
headache
as
i
think
dioscorides
tells
us
and
they
are
the
best
of
all
cures
for
some
children
ailments
and
so
they
walked
up
and
down
together
the
archbishop
talking
quietly
on
and
on
and
helping
quite
unknown
to
himself
by
his
tender
irrelevant
old
man
talk
to
soothe
the
fever
of
unrest
and
anxiety
that
was
beginning
to
torment
anthony
so
much
now
his
conversation
like
the
very
flowers
he
loved
to
speak
of
was
good
against
inflammations
anthony
came
to
him
one
morning
thinking
to
please
him
and
brought
him
a
root
that
he
had
bought
from
a
travelling
pedlar
just
outside
the
gateway
this
is
a
mandrake
root
your
grace
i
heard
you
speak
of
it
the
other
day
the
archbishop
took
it
smiling
felt
it
carefully
peered
at
it
a
minute
or
two
no
my
son
he
said
i
fear
you
have
met
a
knave
this
is
carved
like
a
mandrake
into
the
shape
of
a
man
legs
it
is
worthless
i
fear
but
i
thank
you
for
the
kind
thought
norris
and
he
gave
the
root
back
to
him
and
the
stories
we
hear
of
the
mandrake
i
fear
are
fables
too
some
say
that
they
only
grow
beneath
gallows
from
that
which
falls
there
that
the
male
grows
from
the
corruption
of
a
man
body
and
the
female
from
that
of
a
woman
but
that
is
surely
a
lie
and
a
foul
one
too
and
then
folks
say
that
to
draw
it
up
means
death
and
that
the
mandrake
screams
terribly
as
it
comes
up
and
so
they
bid
us
tie
a
dog
to
it
and
then
drive
the
dog
from
it
so
as
to
draw
it
up
so
i
asked
baker
the
chirurgeon
in
the
household
of
my
lord
oxford
the
other
day
about
that
and
he
said
that
such
tales
be
but
doltish
dreams
and
old
wives
fables
but
the
true
mandrake
is
a
clean
and
wholesome
plant
the
true
ointment
populeon
should
have
the
juice
of
the
leaves
in
it
and
the
root
boiled
and
strained
causes
drowsiness
it
hath
a
predominate
cold
faculty
galen
saith
but
its
true
home
is
not
in
england
at
all
it
comes
from
mount
garganus
in
apulia
it
was
pathetic
anthony
thought
sometimes
that
this
old
prelate
should
be
living
so
far
from
the
movements
of
the
time
owing
to
no
fault
of
his
own
during
these
months
the
great
tragedy
of
campion
passion
was
proceeding
a
couple
of
miles
away
but
the
archbishop
thought
less
of
it
than
of
the
death
of
an
old
tree
the
only
thing
from
the
outside
world
that
seemed
to
ruffle
him
was
the
behaviour
of
the
puritans
anthony
was
passing
through
le
one
afternoon
when
he
heard
voices
in
the
presence
chamber
beyond
and
almost
immediately
heard
the
archbishop
who
had
recognised
his
step
call
his
name
he
went
in
and
found
him
with
a
stranger
in
a
dark
sober
dress
take
this
gentleman
to
scot
he
said
and
ask
him
to
give
him
some
refreshment
for
that
he
must
be
gone
directly
when
anthony
had
taken
the
gentleman
to
the
steward
he
returned
to
the
archbishop
for
any
further
instructions
about
him
no
norris
my
business
is
done
with
him
he
comes
from
my
lord
of
norwich
and
must
be
returning
this
evening
if
you
are
not
occupied
norris
will
you
give
me
your
arm
into
the
garden
they
went
out
by
the
into
the
little
cloisters
and
skirting
the
end
of
the
creek
that
ran
up
by
chichele
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
part
of
the
garden
that
looked
over
the
river
my
lord
has
sent
to
know
if
i
know
aught
of
one
robert
browne
with
whom
he
is
having
trouble
this
browne
has
lately
come
from
cambridge
and
so
my
lord
thought
i
might
know
something
of
him
but
i
do
not
this
gentleman
has
been
saying
some
wild
and
foolish
things
i
fear
and
desires
that
every
church
should
be
free
of
all
others
and
should
appoint
its
own
minister
and
rule
its
own
affairs
without
interference
and
that
prophesyings
should
be
without
restraint
now
you
know
norris
i
have
always
tried
to
serve
that
party
and
support
them
in
their
gospel
religion
but
this
goes
too
far
where
were
any
governance
at
all
if
all
this
were
to
come
about
where
were
the
rule
of
faith
the
power
of
discipline
nay
where
were
the
unity
for
which
our
saviour
prayed
it
liketh
me
not
good
freake
as
his
messenger
tells
me
feels
as
i
do
about
this
and
desires
to
restrain
browne
but
he
is
so
hot
he
will
not
be
restrained
and
besides
he
is
some
kin
to
my
lord
burghley
so
i
fear
his
mouth
will
be
hard
to
stop
anthony
could
not
help
thinking
of
buxton
prediction
that
the
church
of
england
had
so
repudiated
authority
that
in
turn
her
own
would
one
day
be
repudiated
a
papist
prisoner
your
grace
he
said
said
to
me
the
other
day
that
this
would
be
sure
to
come
that
the
whole
principle
of
church
authority
had
been
destroyed
in
england
and
that
the
church
of
england
would
more
and
more
be
deserted
by
her
children
for
that
there
was
no
necessary
centre
of
unity
left
now
that
peter
was
denied
it
is
what
a
papist
is
bound
to
say
replied
the
archbishop
but
it
is
easy
to
prophesy
when
fulfilment
may
be
far
away
indeed
i
think
we
shall
have
trouble
with
some
of
these
zealous
men
and
the
queen
grace
was
surely
right
in
desiring
some
restraint
to
be
put
upon
the
exercises
but
it
is
mere
angry
raving
to
say
that
the
church
of
england
will
lose
the
allegiance
of
her
children
anthony
could
not
feel
convinced
that
events
bore
out
the
assertion
everywhere
the
puritans
were
becoming
more
outrageously
disloyal
there
were
everywhere
signs
of
disaffection
and
revolt
against
the
authorities
of
the
establishment
even
on
the
part
of
the
most
sincere
and
earnest
men
many
of
whom
were
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
the
last
rags
of
popery
should
be
cast
away
and
formal
presbyterianism
inaugurated
in
the
church
of
england
episcopal
ordination
was
more
and
more
being
regarded
as
a
merely
civil
requirement
but
conveying
no
ministerial
commission
recognition
by
the
congregation
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
presbyterate
was
the
only
ordination
they
allowed
as
apostolic
anthony
said
a
word
to
the
archbishop
about
this
you
must
not
be
too
strict
said
the
old
man
both
views
can
be
supported
by
the
scriptures
and
although
the
church
of
england
at
present
recognises
only
episcopal
ordination
within
her
own
borders
she
does
not
dare
to
deny
as
the
papists
fondly
do
that
other
rites
may
not
be
as
efficacious
as
her
own
that
surely
master
norris
is
in
accordance
with
the
mind
of
christ
that
hath
the
spirit
of
liberty
much
as
anthony
loved
the
old
man
and
his
gentle
charity
this
doctrinal
position
as
stated
by
the
chief
pastor
of
the
church
of
england
scarcely
served
to
establish
his
troubled
allegiance
during
these
autumn
months
too
both
between
and
after
the
disputations
in
the
tower
the
image
of
campion
had
been
much
in
his
thoughts
everywhere
except
among
the
irreconcilables
the
jesuit
was
being
well
spoken
of
his
eloquence
his
humour
and
his
apparent
sincerity
were
being
greatly
commented
on
in
london
and
elsewhere
anthony
as
has
been
seen
was
being
deeply
affected
on
both
sides
of
his
nature
the
shrewd
wit
of
the
other
was
in
conflict
with
his
own
intellectual
convictions
and
this
magnetic
personality
was
laying
siege
to
his
heart
and
now
the
last
scene
of
the
tragedy
more
affecting
than
all
was
close
at
hand
anthony
was
present
first
at
the
trial
in
westminster
hall
which
took
place
during
november
and
was
more
than
ever
moved
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
there
the
priest
as
even
his
opponents
confessed
had
by
now
won
a
marvellously
good
report
to
be
such
a
man
as
his
like
was
not
to
be
found
either
for
life
learning
or
any
other
quality
which
might
beautify
a
man
and
now
here
he
stood
at
the
bar
paler
than
ever
so
numbed
with
racking
that
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
to
plead
that
supple
musician
hand
of
his
once
so
skilful
on
the
lute
so
that
sherwin
had
to
lift
it
for
him
out
of
the
furred
cuff
in
which
he
had
wrapped
it
kissing
it
tenderly
as
he
did
so
in
reverence
for
its
sufferings
and
he
saw
too
the
sleek
face
of
eliot
in
his
red
yeoman
coat
as
he
stood
chatting
at
the
back
like
another
barabbas
whom
the
people
preferred
to
the
servant
of
the
crucified
and
above
all
he
heard
campion
stirring
defence
spoken
in
that
same
resonant
sweet
voice
though
it
broke
now
and
then
through
weakness
in
spite
of
the
unconquerable
purpose
and
cheerfulness
that
showed
in
his
great
brown
eyes
and
round
his
delicate
humorous
mouth
it
was
indeed
an
astonishing
combination
of
sincerity
and
eloquence
and
even
humour
that
was
brought
to
bear
on
the
jury
and
all
in
vain
during
those
days
if
you
want
to
dispute
as
though
you
were
in
the
schools
cried
one
of
the
court
when
he
found
himself
out
of
his
depth
you
are
only
proving
yourself
a
fool
i
pray
god
said
campion
while
his
eyes
twinkled
i
pray
god
make
us
both
sages
and
in
spite
of
the
tragedy
of
the
day
a
little
hum
of
laughter
ran
round
the
audience
if
a
sheep
were
stolen
he
argued
again
in
answer
to
the
presupposition
that
since
some
catholics
were
traitors
therefore
these
were
and
a
whole
family
called
in
question
for
the
same
were
it
good
manner
of
proceeding
for
the
accusers
to
say
great
grandfathers
and
fathers
and
sisters
and
kinsfolk
all
loved
mutton
you
have
stolen
the
sheep
again
in
answer
to
the
charge
that
he
and
his
companions
had
conspired
abroad
he
said
as
for
the
accusation
that
we
plotted
treason
at
rheims
reflect
my
lords
how
just
this
charge
is
for
see
first
we
never
met
there
at
all
then
many
of
us
have
never
been
at
rheims
at
all
finally
we
were
never
in
our
lives
all
together
except
at
this
hour
and
in
prison
anthony
heard
too
campion
expose
the
attempt
that
was
made
to
shift
the
charge
from
religion
to
treason
there
was
offer
made
to
us
he
cried
indignantly
that
if
we
would
come
to
the
church
to
hear
sermons
and
the
word
preached
we
should
be
set
at
large
and
at
liberty
so
pascall
and
nicholls
two
apostates
otherwise
as
culpable
in
all
offences
as
we
upon
coming
to
church
were
received
to
grace
and
had
their
pardon
granted
whereas
if
they
had
been
so
happy
as
to
have
persevered
to
the
end
they
had
been
partakers
of
our
calamities
so
that
our
religion
was
cause
of
our
imprisonment
and
of
our
condemnation
the
queen
counsel
tried
to
make
out
that
certain
secrets
that
campion
in
an
intercepted
letter
had
sworn
not
to
reveal
must
be
treasonable
or
he
would
not
so
greatly
fear
their
publication
to
this
the
priest
made
a
stately
defence
of
his
office
and
declaration
of
his
staunchness
he
showed
how
by
his
calling
as
a
priest
he
was
bound
to
secrecy
in
matters
heard
in
confession
and
that
these
secret
matters
were
of
this
nature
these
were
the
hidden
matters
he
said
these
were
the
secrets
to
the
revealing
whereof
i
can
not
nor
will
not
be
brought
come
rack
come
rope
and
again
when
sergeant
anderson
interpreted
a
phrase
of
referring
to
the
great
day
to
which
he
looked
forward
as
meaning
the
day
of
a
foreign
papal
invasion
the
prisoner
cried
in
a
loud
voice
o
judas
judas
no
other
day
was
in
my
mind
i
protest
than
that
wherein
it
should
please
god
to
make
a
restitution
of
faith
and
religion
whereupon
as
in
every
pulpit
every
protestant
doth
i
pronounced
a
great
day
not
wherein
any
temporal
potentate
should
minister
but
wherein
the
terrible
judge
should
reveal
all
men
consciences
and
try
every
man
of
each
kind
of
religion
this
is
the
day
of
change
this
is
the
great
day
which
i
threatened
comfortable
to
the
and
terrible
to
all
heretics
any
other
day
but
this
god
knows
i
meant
not
then
after
the
other
prisoners
had
pleaded
campion
delivered
a
final
defence
to
the
jury
with
a
solemnity
that
seemed
to
belong
to
a
judge
rather
than
a
criminal
the
babble
of
tongues
that
had
continued
most
of
the
day
was
hushed
to
a
profound
silence
in
court
as
he
stood
and
spoke
for
the
sincerity
and
simplicity
of
the
priest
were
evident
to
all
and
combined
with
his
eloquence
and
his
strange
attractive
personality
dominated
all
but
those
whose
minds
were
already
made
up
before
entering
the
court
what
charge
this
day
you
sustain
began
the
priest
in
a
steady
low
voice
with
his
searching
eyes
bent
on
the
faces
before
him
and
what
account
you
are
to
render
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
whereof
i
could
wish
this
also
were
a
mirror
i
trust
there
is
not
one
of
you
but
knoweth
i
doubt
not
but
in
like
manner
you
forecast
how
dear
the
innocent
is
to
god
and
at
what
price
he
holdeth
man
blood
here
we
are
accused
and
impleaded
to
the
death
he
began
to
raise
his
voice
a
little
here
you
do
receive
our
lives
into
your
custody
here
must
be
your
device
either
to
restore
them
or
condemn
them
we
have
no
whither
to
appeal
but
to
your
consciences
we
have
no
friends
to
make
there
but
your
heeds
and
discretions
then
he
touched
briefly
on
the
evidence
showing
how
faulty
and
circumstantial
it
was
and
urged
them
to
remember
that
a
man
life
by
the
very
constitution
of
the
realm
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
mere
probabilities
or
presumptions
then
he
showed
the
untrustworthiness
of
his
accusers
how
one
had
confessed
himself
a
murderer
and
how
another
was
an
atheist
then
he
ended
with
a
word
or
two
of
appeal
god
give
you
grace
he
cried
to
weigh
our
causes
aright
and
have
respect
to
your
own
consciences
and
so
i
will
keep
the
jury
no
longer
i
commit
the
rest
to
god
and
our
convictions
to
your
good
discretions
when
the
jury
had
retired
and
all
the
judges
but
one
had
left
the
bench
until
the
jury
should
return
anthony
sat
back
in
his
place
his
heart
beating
and
his
eyes
looking
restlessly
now
on
the
prisoners
now
on
the
door
where
the
jury
had
gone
out
and
now
on
judge
ayloff
whom
he
knew
a
little
and
who
sat
only
a
few
feet
away
from
him
on
one
side
he
could
hear
the
lawyers
sitting
below
the
judge
talking
among
themselves
and
presently
one
of
them
leaned
over
to
him
norris
he
said
you
have
come
to
see
an
acquittal
i
doubt
not
no
man
can
be
in
two
minds
after
what
we
have
heard
at
least
concerning
campion
we
all
think
so
here
at
any
rate
the
lawyer
was
going
on
to
say
a
word
or
two
more
as
to
the
eloquence
when
there
was
a
sharp
exclamation
from
the
judge
anthony
looked
up
and
saw
judge
ayloff
staring
at
his
hand
turning
it
over
while
he
held
his
glove
in
the
other
and
anthony
saw
to
his
surprise
that
the
fingers
were
all
one
or
two
gentlemen
near
him
turned
and
looked
too
as
the
judge
still
staring
and
growing
a
little
pale
wiped
the
blood
quickly
away
with
the
glove
but
the
fingers
grew
crimson
again
immediately
said
ayloff
half
to
himself
is
strange
there
is
no
wound
a
moment
later
looking
up
he
saw
many
of
his
neighbours
glancing
curiously
at
his
hand
and
his
pale
face
and
hastily
thrust
on
his
glove
again
and
immediately
after
the
jury
returned
and
the
judges
filed
in
to
take
their
places
anthony
attention
was
drawn
off
again
and
the
buzz
of
talk
in
the
court
was
followed
again
by
a
deep
silence
the
verdict
of
was
uttered
as
had
been
and
the
queen
counsel
demanded
sentence
campion
and
the
rest
said
chief
justice
wray
what
can
you
say
why
you
should
not
die
then
campion
still
steady
and
resolute
made
his
last
useless
appeal
it
was
not
our
death
that
ever
we
feared
but
we
knew
that
we
were
not
lords
of
our
own
lives
and
therefore
for
want
of
answer
would
not
be
guilty
of
our
own
deaths
the
only
thing
that
we
have
now
to
say
is
that
if
our
religion
do
make
us
traitors
we
are
worthy
to
be
condemned
but
otherwise
are
and
have
been
true
subjects
as
ever
the
queen
had
in
condemning
us
you
condemn
all
your
own
ancestors
and
as
he
said
this
his
voice
began
to
rise
and
he
glanced
steadily
and
mournfully
round
at
the
staring
faces
about
him
all
the
ancient
priests
bishops
and
kings
all
that
was
once
the
glory
of
england
the
island
of
saints
and
the
most
devoted
child
of
the
see
of
peter
then
as
he
went
on
he
flung
out
his
wrenched
hands
and
his
voice
rang
with
indignant
defiance
for
what
have
we
taught
he
cried
however
you
may
qualify
it
with
the
odious
name
of
treason
that
they
did
not
uniformly
teach
to
be
condemned
with
these
old
lights
not
of
england
only
but
of
the
world
by
their
degenerate
descendants
is
both
gladness
and
glory
to
us
then
with
a
superb
gesture
he
sent
his
voice
pealing
through
the
hall
god
lives
posterity
will
live
their
judgment
is
not
so
liable
to
corruption
as
that
of
those
who
are
now
about
to
sentence
us
to
death
there
was
a
burst
of
murmurous
applause
as
he
ended
which
stilled
immediately
as
the
chief
justice
began
to
deliver
sentence
but
when
the
horrible
details
of
his
execution
had
been
enumerated
and
the
formula
had
ended
it
was
the
prisoner
turn
to
applaud
deum
laudamus
cried
campion
dominum
est
shouted
sherwin
fecit
dominus
exultemus
et
laetemur
in
and
so
with
the
thanksgiving
and
joy
of
the
condemned
criminals
the
ended
when
anthony
rode
down
silently
and
alone
in
the
rain
that
december
morning
a
few
days
later
to
see
the
end
he
found
a
vast
silent
crowd
assembled
on
tower
hill
and
round
the
gateway
where
the
four
horses
were
waiting
each
pair
harnessed
to
a
hurdle
laid
flat
on
the
ground
he
would
not
go
in
for
he
could
scarcely
trust
himself
to
speak
so
great
was
his
horror
of
the
crime
that
was
to
be
committed
so
he
backed
his
horse
against
the
wall
and
waited
over
an
hour
in
silence
scarcely
hearing
the
murmurs
of
impatience
that
rolled
round
the
great
crowd
from
time
to
time
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
here
was
the
climax
of
these
days
of
misery
and
that
had
passed
since
the
trial
in
westminster
hall
it
was
no
use
he
argued
to
himself
to
pretend
otherwise
these
three
men
of
god
were
to
die
for
their
religion
and
a
religion
too
which
was
gradually
detaching
itself
to
his
view
from
the
mists
and
clouds
that
hid
it
as
the
one
great
reality
and
truth
of
revelation
to
man
he
had
come
he
knew
to
see
not
an
execution
but
a
martyrdom
there
was
a
trampling
from
within
the
bolts
creaked
and
the
gate
rolled
back
a
company
of
halberdiers
emerged
and
in
their
midst
the
three
priests
in
laymen
dress
behind
followed
a
few
men
on
horseback
with
a
little
company
of
ministers
bible
in
hand
and
then
a
rabble
of
officers
and
pursuivants
anthony
edged
his
horse
in
among
the
others
as
the
crowd
fell
back
and
took
up
his
place
in
the
second
rank
of
riders
between
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
who
made
room
for
him
on
the
one
side
and
sir
francis
knowles
on
the
other
and
behind
the
tower
officials
then
once
more
he
heard
that
ringing
bass
voice
whose
first
sound
silenced
the
murmurs
of
the
surging
excited
crowd
god
save
you
all
gentlemen
god
bless
you
and
make
you
all
good
catholics
then
as
the
priest
turned
to
kneel
towards
the
east
he
saw
his
face
paler
than
ever
now
after
his
long
fast
in
preparation
for
death
the
rain
was
still
falling
as
campion
in
his
frieze
gown
knelt
in
the
mud
there
was
silence
as
he
prayed
and
as
he
ended
aloud
by
commending
his
soul
to
god
manus
tuas
domine
commendo
spiritum
the
three
were
secured
to
the
hurdles
briant
and
sherwin
on
the
one
campion
on
the
other
all
lying
on
their
backs
with
their
feet
towards
the
horse
heels
the
word
to
start
was
given
by
sir
owen
hopton
who
rode
with
charke
the
preacher
of
gray
inn
in
the
front
rank
the
lashed
horses
plunged
forward
with
the
jolting
hurdles
spattering
mud
behind
them
and
the
dismal
pageant
began
to
move
forward
through
the
crowd
on
that
way
of
sorrows
there
was
a
ceaseless
roar
and
babble
of
voices
as
they
went
charke
in
his
minister
dress
able
now
to
declaim
without
fear
of
reply
was
hardly
silent
for
a
moment
from
mocking
and
rebuking
the
prisoners
and
making
pompous
speeches
to
the
people
see
here
he
cried
these
rogueing
popish
priests
laid
by
the
heels
aye
by
the
heels
at
last
in
spite
of
their
tricks
and
turns
see
this
fellow
in
his
frieze
gown
dead
to
the
world
as
he
brags
and
know
how
he
skulked
and
hid
in
his
disguises
till
her
majesty
servants
plucked
him
forth
we
will
disguise
him
we
will
disguise
him
ere
we
have
done
with
him
that
his
own
mother
should
not
know
him
ha
now
campion
do
you
hear
me
and
so
the
harsh
voice
rang
out
over
the
crowd
that
tramped
alongside
and
up
to
the
faces
that
filled
every
window
while
the
ministers
below
kept
up
a
ceaseless
murmur
of
adjuration
and
entreaty
and
threatening
with
a
turning
of
leaves
of
their
bibles
and
bursts
of
prayer
over
the
three
heads
that
jolted
and
rocked
at
their
feet
over
the
cobblestones
and
through
the
mud
the
friends
of
the
prisoners
walked
as
near
to
them
as
they
dared
and
their
lips
moved
continually
in
prayer
every
now
and
then
as
anthony
craned
his
head
he
could
see
face
with
closed
eyes
and
moving
lips
that
smiled
again
and
again
all
spattered
and
dripping
with
filth
and
once
he
saw
a
gentleman
walking
beside
him
fearlessly
stoop
down
and
wipe
the
priest
face
with
a
handkerchief
presently
they
had
passed
up
cheapside
and
reached
newgate
in
a
niche
in
the
archway
itself
stood
a
figure
of
the
mother
of
god
looking
compassionately
down
and
as
campion
hurdle
passed
beneath
it
her
servant
wrenched
himself
a
few
inches
up
in
his
bonds
and
bowed
to
his
glorious
queen
and
then
laid
himself
down
quietly
again
as
a
chorus
of
lament
rose
from
the
ministers
over
his
superstition
and
obstinate
idolatry
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
last
even
to
death
and
charke
too
who
had
become
somewhat
more
silent
broke
out
again
into
revilings
the
crowd
at
tyburn
was
vast
beyond
all
reckoning
outside
the
gate
it
stretched
on
every
side
under
the
elms
a
few
were
even
in
the
branches
along
the
sides
of
the
stream
everywhere
was
a
sea
of
heads
out
of
which
on
a
little
eminence
like
another
calvary
rose
up
the
tall
posts
of
the
gallows
on
which
the
martyrs
were
to
suffer
as
the
hurdles
came
slowly
under
the
gate
the
sun
broke
out
for
the
first
time
and
as
the
horses
that
drew
the
hurdles
came
round
towards
the
carts
that
stood
near
the
gallows
and
the
platform
on
which
the
quartering
block
stood
a
murmur
began
that
ran
through
the
crowd
from
those
nearest
the
but
they
are
laughing
they
are
laughing
the
crowd
gave
a
surge
to
and
fro
as
the
horses
drew
up
and
anthony
reined
his
own
beast
back
among
the
people
so
that
he
was
just
opposite
the
beam
on
which
the
three
new
ropes
were
already
hanging
and
beneath
which
was
standing
a
cart
with
the
back
taken
out
in
the
cart
waited
a
dreadful
figure
in
a
dress
sinewy
arms
bare
to
the
shoulder
and
a
butcher
knife
at
his
leather
girdle
a
little
distance
away
stood
the
hateful
cauldron
bubbling
fiercely
with
black
smoke
pouring
from
under
it
the
platform
with
the
block
and
stood
beneath
the
gallows
and
round
this
now
stood
the
officers
with
norton
the
and
sir
owen
hopton
and
the
rest
and
the
three
priests
with
the
soldiers
forming
a
circle
to
keep
the
crowd
back
the
hangman
stooped
as
anthony
looked
and
a
moment
later
campion
stood
beside
him
on
the
cart
pale
but
with
the
same
serene
smile
his
great
brown
eyes
shone
as
they
looked
out
over
the
wide
heaving
sea
of
heads
from
which
a
deep
murmur
rose
as
the
famous
priest
appeared
anthony
could
see
every
detail
of
what
went
on
the
hangman
took
the
noose
that
hung
from
above
and
slipped
it
over
the
prisoner
head
and
drew
it
close
round
his
neck
and
then
himself
slipped
down
from
the
cart
and
stood
with
the
others
still
well
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
but
leaving
the
priest
standing
higher
yet
on
the
cart
silhouetted
rope
and
all
framed
in
the
posts
and
from
which
two
more
ropes
hung
dangling
against
the
driving
clouds
and
blue
sky
over
london
city
campion
waited
perfectly
motionless
for
the
murmur
of
innumerable
voices
to
die
down
and
anthony
fascinated
and
afraid
beneath
that
overpowering
serenity
watched
him
turn
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
with
a
majestical
countenance
as
his
enemies
confessed
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
speaking
silence
seemed
to
radiate
out
from
him
spreading
like
a
ripple
outwards
until
the
furthest
outskirts
of
that
huge
crowd
was
motionless
and
quiet
and
then
without
apparent
effort
his
voice
began
to
peal
out
facti
sumus
deo
angelis
et
these
are
the
words
of
saint
paul
englished
thus
are
made
a
spectacle
or
sight
unto
god
unto
his
angels
and
unto
men
verified
this
day
in
me
who
am
here
a
spectacle
unto
my
lord
god
a
spectacle
unto
his
angels
and
unto
you
men
satisfying
myself
to
die
as
becometh
a
true
christian
and
catholic
man
he
was
interrupted
by
cries
from
the
gentlemen
beneath
and
turned
a
little
looking
down
to
see
what
they
wished
you
are
not
here
to
preach
to
the
people
said
sir
francis
knowles
angrily
but
to
confess
yourself
a
traitor
campion
smiled
and
shook
his
head
no
no
he
said
and
then
looking
up
and
raising
his
voice
as
to
the
treasons
which
have
been
laid
to
my
charge
and
for
which
i
am
come
here
to
suffer
i
desire
you
all
to
bear
witness
with
me
that
i
am
thereof
altogether
innocent
there
was
a
chorus
of
anger
from
the
gentlemen
and
one
of
them
called
up
something
that
anthony
could
not
hear
campion
raised
his
eyebrows
well
my
lord
he
cried
aloud
and
his
voice
instantly
silenced
again
the
noisy
buzz
of
talk
i
am
a
catholic
man
and
a
priest
in
that
faith
have
i
lived
and
in
that
faith
do
i
intend
to
die
if
you
esteem
my
religion
treason
then
am
i
guilty
as
for
other
treason
i
never
committed
any
god
is
my
judge
but
you
have
now
what
you
desire
i
beseech
you
to
have
patience
and
suffer
me
to
speak
a
word
or
two
for
discharge
of
my
conscience
there
was
a
furious
burst
of
refusals
from
the
officers
well
said
campion
at
last
looking
straight
out
over
the
crowd
it
seems
i
may
not
speak
but
this
only
will
i
say
that
i
am
wholly
innocent
of
all
treason
and
conspiracy
as
god
is
my
judge
and
i
beseech
you
to
credit
me
for
it
is
my
last
answer
upon
my
death
and
soul
as
for
the
jury
i
do
not
blame
them
for
they
were
ignorant
men
and
easily
deceived
i
forgive
all
who
have
compassed
my
death
or
wronged
me
in
any
whit
as
i
hope
to
be
forgiven
and
i
ask
the
forgiveness
of
all
those
whose
names
i
spoke
upon
the
rack
then
he
said
a
word
or
two
more
of
explanation
such
as
he
had
said
during
his
trial
for
the
sake
of
those
catholics
whom
this
a
concession
of
his
had
scandalised
telling
them
that
he
had
had
the
promise
of
the
council
that
no
harm
should
come
to
those
whose
names
he
revealed
and
then
was
silent
again
closing
his
eyes
and
anthony
as
he
watched
him
saw
his
lips
moving
once
more
in
prayer
then
a
harsh
loud
voice
from
behind
the
cart
began
to
proclaim
that
the
queen
punished
no
man
for
religion
but
only
for
treason
a
fierce
murmur
of
disagreement
and
protest
began
to
rise
from
the
crowd
and
anthony
turning
saw
the
faces
of
many
near
him
frowning
and
pursing
their
lips
and
there
was
a
shout
or
two
of
denial
here
and
there
the
harsh
voice
ceased
and
another
began
now
campion
it
cried
tell
us
what
of
the
pope
do
you
renounce
him
campion
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
round
i
am
a
catholic
he
said
simply
and
closed
his
eyes
again
for
prayer
as
the
voice
cried
brutally
in
your
catholicism
all
treason
is
contained
again
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
then
a
new
voice
from
the
black
group
of
ministers
called
out
campion
campion
leave
that
popish
stuff
and
say
have
mercy
on
me
again
the
priest
opened
his
eyes
you
and
i
are
not
one
in
religion
sir
wherefore
i
pray
you
content
yourself
i
bar
none
of
prayer
but
i
only
desire
them
of
the
household
of
faith
to
pray
with
me
and
in
mine
agony
to
say
one
creed
again
he
closed
his
eyes
noster
qui
es
in
pray
in
english
pray
in
english
shouted
a
voice
from
the
group
once
more
the
priest
opened
his
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
badgering
his
eyes
shone
with
humour
and
his
mouth
broke
into
smiles
so
that
a
great
sob
of
pity
and
love
broke
from
anthony
i
will
pray
to
god
in
a
language
that
both
he
and
i
well
understand
ask
her
grace
forgiveness
campion
and
pray
for
her
if
you
be
her
true
subject
wherein
have
i
offended
her
in
this
i
am
innocent
this
is
my
last
speech
in
this
give
me
credit
i
have
and
do
pray
for
her
aha

which
queen
for
elizabeth
ay
for
elizabeth
your
queen
and
my
queen
unto
whom
i
wish
a
long
quiet
reign
with
all
prosperity
there
was
the
crack
of
a
whip
the
scuffle
of
a
horse
feet
a
rippling
movement
over
the
crowd
and
a
great
murmured
roar
like
the
roar
of
the
waves
on
a
pebbly
beach
as
the
horse
head
began
to
move
forward
and
the
priest
figure
to
sway
and
stagger
on
the
jolting
cart
anthony
shut
his
eyes
and
the
murmur
and
cries
of
the
crowd
grew
louder
and
louder
once
more
the
deep
sweet
voice
rang
out
loud
and
penetrating
i

a
true
catholic
anthony
kept
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
bent
as
great
sobs
began
to
break
up
out
of
his
heart
ah
he
was
in
his
agony
now
that
sudden
cry
and
silence
from
the
crowd
showed
it
what
was
it
he
had
asked
one
creed

in

the

almighty
the
soft
heavy
murmur
of

chapter
vii
a
message
from
the
city
sir
francis
walsingham
sat
in
his
private
room
a
month
after
father
campion
death
he
had
settled
down
again
now
to
his
work
which
had
been
so
grievously
interrupted
by
his
mission
to
france
in
connection
with
a
new
treaty
between
that
country
and
england
in
the
previous
year
the
secret
detective
service
that
he
had
inaugurated
in
england
chiefly
for
the
protection
of
the
queen
person
was
a
vast
and
complicated
business
and
the
superintendence
of
this
in
addition
to
the
other
affairs
of
his
office
made
him
an
exceedingly
busy
man
england
was
honeycombed
with
mines
and
countermines
both
in
the
political
and
the
religious
world
and
it
needed
all
this
man
brilliant
and
trained
faculties
to
keep
abreast
with
them
his
spies
and
agents
were
everywhere
and
not
only
in
england
they
circled
round
mary
of
scotland
like
flies
round
a
wounded
creature
seeking
to
settle
and
penetrate
wherever
an
opening
showed
itself
these
scottish
troubles
would
have
been
enough
for
any
ordinary
man
but
walsingham
was
indefatigable
and
his
agents
were
in
every
prison
lurking
round
corridors
in
private
houses
found
alike
in
kitchens
and
at
gentlemen
tables
just
at
present
walsingham
was
anxious
to
give
all
the
attention
he
could
to
scottish
affairs
and
on
this
wet
dreary
thursday
morning
in
january
as
he
sat
before
his
bureau
he
was
meditating
how
to
deal
with
an
affair
that
had
come
to
him
from
the
heart
of
london
and
how
if
possible
to
shift
the
conduct
of
it
on
to
other
shoulders
he
sat
and
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
desk
and
stared
meditatively
at
the
before
him
his
was
an
interesting
face
with
large
melancholy
and
almost
fanatical
eyes
and
a
poet
mouth
and
forehead
but
it
was
probably
exactly
his
imaginative
faculties
that
enabled
him
to
picture
public
affairs
from
the
points
of
view
of
the
very
various
persons
concerned
in
them
and
thereby
to
cope
with
the
complications
arising
out
of
these
conflicting
interests
he
stroked
his
pointed
beard
once
or
twice
and
then
struck
a
at
his
side
and
a
servant
entered
if
lackington
is
below
he
said
show
him
here
immediately
and
the
servant
went
out
lackington
sometime
servant
to
sir
nicholas
maxwell
had
entered
sir
francis
service
instead
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
exchanged
the
catholic
for
the
protestant
religion
and
he
was
now
one
of
his
most
trusted
agents
but
he
had
been
in
so
many
matters
connected
with
recusancy
that
a
large
number
of
the
papists
in
london
were
beginning
to
know
him
by
sight
and
the
affairs
were
becoming
more
and
more
scarce
in
which
he
could
be
employed
among
catholics
with
any
hope
of
success
it
was
his
custom
to
call
morning
by
morning
at
sir
francis
office
and
receive
his
instructions
and
just
now
he
had
returned
from
business
in
the
country
presently
he
entered
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
bowed
profoundly
to
his
master
i
have
a
matter
on
hand
lackington
said
sir
francis
without
looking
at
him
and
without
any
salutation
beyond
a
glance
and
a
nod
as
he
entered
a
matter
which
i
have
not
leisure
to
look
into
as
it
is
not
i
think
anything
more
than
mere
religion
but
which
might
i
think
repay
you
for
your
trouble
if
you
can
manage
it
in
any
way
but
it
is
a
troublesome
business
these
are
the
facts
no
newman
court
in
the
city
has
been
a
suspected
house
for
some
while
i
have
had
it
watched
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
papists
use
it
i
thought
at
first
that
the
scots
were
mixed
up
with
it
but
that
is
not
so
yesterday
a
boy
of
twelve
years
old
left
the
house
in
the
afternoon
and
was
followed
to
a
number
of
houses
of
which
i
will
give
you
the
list
presently
and
was
finally
arrested
in
paul
churchyard
and
brought
here
i
frightened
him
with
talk
of
the
rack
and
i
think
i
have
the
truth
out
of
him
now
i
have
tested
him
in
the
usual
ways
and
all
that
i
can
find
is
that
the
house
is
used
for
mass
now
and
then
and
that
he
was
going
to
the
papists
houses
yesterday
to
bid
them
come
for
next
sunday
morning
but
he
was
stopped
too
soon
he
had
not
yet
told
the
priest
to
come
now
unless
the
priest
is
told
by
one
whom
he
trusts
there
will
be
no
mass
on
sunday
and
the
nest
of
papists
will
escape
us
it
is
of
no
use
to
send
the
boy
as
he
will
betray
all
by
his
behaviour
even
if
we
frighten
him
into
saying
what
we
wish
to
the
priest
i
suppose
it
is
of
no
use
your
going
to
the
priest
and
feigning
to
be
a
catholic
messenger
and
i
can
not
at
this
moment
see
what
is
to
be
done
if
there
were
anything
beyond
mere
religion
in
this
i
would
spare
no
pains
to
hunt
them
out
but
it
is
not
worth
my
while
yet
there
is
the
reward
and
if
you
think
that
you
can
do
anything
you
can
have
it
for
your
pains
i
can
spare
you
till
monday
and
of
course
you
shall
have
what
men
you
will
to
surround
the
house
and
take
them
at
mass
if
you
can
but
get
the
priest
there
thank
you
sir
said
lackington
deferentially
have
i
your
leave
to
see
the
boy
in
your
presence
walsingham
struck
the
bell
again
bring
the
lad
that
is
locked
in
the
steward
parlour
he
said
when
the
servant
sit
down
lackington
and
examine
him
when
he
comes
and
sir
francis
took
down
some
papers
from
a
sorted
out
one
or
two
and
saying
here
are
his
statements
handed
them
to
the
agent
who
began
to
glance
through
them
at
once
walsingham
then
turned
to
his
table
again
and
began
to
go
on
with
his
letters
in
a
moment
or
two
the
door
opened
and
a
little
lad
of
twelve
years
old
came
in
followed
by
the
servant
that
will
do
said
walsingham
without
looking
up
you
can
leave
him
here
and
the
servant
went
out
the
boy
stood
back
against
the
wall
by
the
door
his
face
was
white
and
his
eyes
full
of
horror
and
he
looked
in
a
dazed
way
at
the
two
men
what
is
your
name
boy
began
lackington
in
a
sharp
judicial
tone
john
belton
said
the
lad
in
a
tremulous
voice
and
you
are
a
little
papist
asked
the
agent
no
sir
a
protestant
then
how
is
it
that
you
go
on
errands
for
papists
i
am
a
servant
sir
said
the
boy
imploringly
lackington
turned
the
papers
over
for
a
moment
or
two
now
you
know
he
began
again
in
a
threatening
voice
that
this
gentleman
has
power
to
put
you
on
the
rack
you
know
what
that
is
the
boy
nodded
in
mute
terror
well
now
he
will
hear
all
you
say
and
will
know
whether
you
say
the
truth
or
not
now
tell
me
if
you
still
hold
to
what
you
said
yesterday
and
then
lackington
with
the
aid
of
the
papers
ran
quickly
over
the
story
that
sir
francis
had
related
now
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
john
belton
he
added
that
you
a
protestant
and
a
lad
of
twelve
are
employed
on
this
work
by
papists
to
gather
them
for
mass
the
boy
looked
at
him
with
the
same
earnest
horror
yes
sir
yes
sir
he
said
and
there
was
a
piteous
sob
in
his
voice
indeed
it
is
all
true
but
i
do
not
often
go
on
these
messages
for
my
master
roger
generally
goes
but
he
is
sick
oho
said
lackington
you
did
not
say
that
yesterday
the
boy
was
terrified
no
sir
he
cried
out
miserably
the
gentleman
did
not
ask
me
well
who
is
roger
what
is
he
like
he
is
my
master
servant
sir
and
he
wears
a
patch
over
his
eye
and
stutters
a
little
in
his
speech
these
kinds
of
details
were
plainly
beyond
a
frightened
lad
power
of
invention
and
lackington
was
more
satisfied
and
what
was
the
message
that
you
were
to
give
to
the
folk
and
the
priest
please
sir
for
all
things
are
now
ready
this
was
such
a
queer
answer
that
lackington
gave
an
incredulous
exclamation
it
is
probably
true
said
sir
francis
without
looking
up
from
his
letters
i
have
come
across
the
same
kind
of
cypher
at
least
once
before
thank
you
sir
said
the
agent
and
now
my
boy
tell
me
this
how
did
you
know
what
it
meant
please
sir
said
the
lad
a
little
encouraged
by
the
kinder
tone
i
have
noticed
that
twice
before
when
roger
could
not
go
and
i
was
sent
with
the
same
message
all
the
folks
and
the
priest
came
on
the
next
sunday
and
i
think
that
it
means
that
all
is
safe
and
that
they
can
come
you
are
a
sharp
lad
said
the
spy
approvingly
i
am
satisfied
with
you
then
sir
may
i
go
home
asked
the
boy
with
hopeful
entreaty
in
his
voice
nay
nay
said
the
other
i
have
not
done
with
you
yet
answer
me
some
more
questions
why
did
you
not
go
to
the
priest
first
because
i
was
bidden
to
go
to
him
last
said
the
boy
if
i
had
been
to
all
the
other
houses
by
five
last
night
then
i
was
to
meet
the
priest
at
papists
corner
in
paul
church
but
if
i
had
not
done
them
as
i
had
not
then
i
was
to
see
the
priest
at
the
same
place
lackington
mused
a
moment
what
is
the
priest
name
he
asked
please
sir
arthur
oldham
the
agent
gave
a
sudden
start
and
a
keen
glance
at
the
boy
and
then
smiled
to
himself
then
he
meditated
and
bit
his
nails
once
or
twice
and
when
was
roger
taken
ill
he
slipped
down
at
the
door
of
his
lodging
and
hurt
his
foot
at
yesterday
and
he
could
not
walk
his
lodging
then
he
does
not
sleep
in
the
house
no
sir
he
sleeps
in
stafford
alley
round
the
corner
and
where
do
you
live
please
sir
i
go
home
to
my
mother
nearly
every
night
but
not
always
and
where
does
your
mother
live
please
sir
at
bell
lane
lackington
remained
deep
in
thought
and
looked
at
the
boy
steadily
for
a
minute
or
two
now
sir
may
i
go
he
asked
eagerly
lackington
paid
no
attention
and
he
repeated
his
question
the
agent
still
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
but
turned
to
sir
francis
who
was
still
at
his
letters
that
is
all
sir
for
the
present
he
said
may
the
boy
be
kept
here
till
monday
the
lad
broke
out
into
wailing
but
lackington
turned
on
him
a
face
so
savage
that
his
whimpers
died
away
into
silence
as
you
will
said
sir
francis
pausing
for
a
moment
in
his
writing
and
striking
the
bell
again
and
on
the
servant
appearance
gave
orders
that
john
belton
should
be
taken
again
to
the
steward
parlour
until
further
directions
were
received
the
boy
went
sobbing
out
and
down
the
passage
again
under
the
servant
charge
and
the
door
closed
and
the
mother
asked
walsingham
abruptly
pausing
with
pen
upraised
with
your
permission
sir
i
will
tell
her
that
her
boy
is
in
trouble
and
that
if
his
master
sends
to
inquire
for
him
she
is
to
say
he
is
sick
upstairs
and
you
will
report
to
me
on
monday
yes
sir
by
then
i
shall
hope
to
have
taken
the
crew
sir
francis
nodded
his
head
sharply
and
the
pen
began
to
fly
over
the
paper
again
as
lackington
slipped
out
anthony
norris
was
passing
through
the
court
of
lambeth
house
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
when
the
porter
came
to
him
and
said
there
was
a
child
waiting
in
the
lodge
with
a
note
for
him
and
would
master
norris
kindly
come
to
see
her
he
found
a
little
girl
on
the
bench
by
the
gate
who
stood
up
and
curtseyed
as
the
grand
gentleman
came
striding
in
and
handed
him
a
note
which
he
opened
at
once
and
read
for
the
love
of
god
the
note
ran
come
and
aid
one
who
can
be
of
service
to
a
friend
follow
the
little
maid
master
norris
and
she
will
bring
you
to
me
if
you
have
any
friends
at
for
the
love
you
bear
to
them
come
quickly
anthony
turned
the
note
over
it
was
unsigned
and
undated
on
his
inquiry
further
from
the
little
girl
she
said
she
knew
nothing
about
the
writer
but
that
a
gentleman
had
given
her
the
note
and
told
her
to
bring
it
to
master
anthony
norris
at
lambeth
house
and
that
she
was
to
take
him
to
a
house
that
she
knew
in
the
city
she
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
house
she
said
it
was
all
very
strange
thought
anthony
but
evidently
here
was
some
one
who
knew
about
him
the
reference
to
great
keynes
made
him
think
uneasily
of
isabel
and
wonder
whether
any
harm
had
happened
to
her
or
whether
any
danger
threatened
he
stood
musing
with
the
note
between
his
fingers
and
then
told
the
child
to
go
straight
down
to
paul
cross
and
await
him
there
and
he
would
follow
immediately
the
child
ran
off
and
anthony
went
round
to
the
stables
to
get
his
horse
he
rode
straight
down
to
the
city
and
put
up
his
horse
in
the
bishop
stables
and
then
went
round
with
his
in
his
hand
to
paul
cross
it
was
a
dull
miserable
afternoon
beginning
to
close
in
with
a
fine
rain
falling
and
very
few
people
were
about
and
he
found
the
child
crouched
up
against
the
pulpit
in
an
attempt
to
keep
dry
come
he
said
kindly
i
am
ready
show
me
the
way
the
child
led
him
along
by
the
cathedral
through
the
churchyard
and
then
by
winding
passages
where
anthony
kept
a
good
at
the
corners
for
a
stab
in
the
back
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
gentleman
off
his
guard
the
houses
overhead
leaned
so
nearly
together
that
the
darkening
sky
disappeared
altogether
now
and
then
at
one
spot
anthony
caught
a
glimpse
high
up
of
bow
church
spire
and
after
a
corner
or
two
the
child
stopped
before
a
doorway
in
a
little
flagged
court
it
is
here
she
said
and
before
anthony
could
stop
her
she
had
slipped
away
and
disappeared
through
a
passage
he
looked
at
the
house
it
was
a
place
the
door
was
heavily
studded
with
nails
and
gave
a
most
respectable
air
to
the
house
the
leaded
windows
were
just
over
his
head
and
tightly
closed
there
was
an
air
of
mute
discretion
and
silence
about
the
place
that
roused
a
vague
discomfort
in
anthony
mind
he
slipped
his
right
hand
into
his
belt
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
hilt
of
his
knife
was
within
reach
overhead
the
hanging
windows
and
eaves
bulged
out
on
all
sides
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
it
seemed
a
place
that
had
slipped
into
a
backwater
of
the
humming
stream
of
the
city
the
fine
rain
still
falling
added
to
the
dismal
aspect
of
the
little
court
he
looked
round
once
more
and
then
rapped
sharply
at
the
door
to
which
the
child
had
pointed
there
was
silence
for
at
least
a
minute
then
as
he
was
about
to
knock
again
there
was
a
faint
sound
overhead
and
he
looked
up
in
time
to
see
a
face
swiftly
withdrawn
from
one
of
the
windows
evidently
an
occupant
of
the
house
had
been
examining
the
visitor
then
shuffling
footsteps
came
along
a
passage
within
and
a
light
shone
under
the
door
there
was
a
noise
of
bolts
being
withdrawn
and
the
rattle
of
a
chain
and
then
the
handle
turned
and
the
door
opened
slowly
inwards
and
an
old
woman
stood
there
holding
an
oil
lamp
over
her
head
this
was
not
very
formidable
at
any
rate
i
have
been
bidden
to
come
here
he
said
by
a
letter
delivered
to
me
an
hour
ago
ah
said
the
old
woman
and
looked
at
him
peeringly
then
you
are
for
mr
roger
i
daresay
said
anthony
a
little
sharply
he
was
not
accustomed
to
be
treated
like
this
the
old
woman
still
looked
at
him
suspiciously
and
then
as
anthony
made
a
movement
of
impatience
she
stepped
back
come
in
sir
she
said
he
stepped
in
and
she
closed
and
fastened
the
door
again
behind
him
and
then
holding
the
high
over
her
head
she
advanced
in
her
slippers
towards
the
staircase
and
anthony
followed
on
the
stairs
she
turned
once
to
see
if
he
was
coming
and
beckoned
him
on
with
a
movement
of
her
head
anthony
looked
about
him
as
he
went
up
there
was
nothing
remarkable
or
suspicious
about
the
house
in
any
way
it
was
cleaner
than
he
had
been
led
to
expect
by
its
outside
aspect
wainscoted
to
the
ceiling
with
oak
and
the
stairs
were
strong
and
well
made
it
was
plainly
a
very
tolerably
respectable
place
and
anthony
began
to
think
from
its
appearance
that
he
had
been
admitted
at
the
back
door
of
some
house
off
cheapside
the
banisters
were
carved
with
some
distinction
and
there
were
the
rudimentary
elements
of
design
on
the
panels
that
lined
the
opposite
walls
up
to
the
height
of
the
banisters
the
woman
went
up
and
up
slowly
panting
a
little
at
each
landing
she
turned
and
glanced
back
to
see
that
her
companion
was
following
all
the
doors
that
they
passed
were
discreetly
shut
and
the
house
was
perfectly
dark
except
for
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamp
and
silent
except
for
the
noise
of
the
footsteps
and
the
rush
of
a
mouse
now
and
then
behind
the
woodwork
at
the
third
landing
she
stopped
and
came
close
up
to
anthony
that
is
the
door
she
whispered
hoarsely
and
pointed
with
her
thumb
towards
a
doorway
that
was
opposite
the
staircase
ask
for
master
roger
and
then
without
saying
any
more
she
set
the
lamp
down
on
the
flat
head
of
the
top
banister
and
herself
began
to
shuffle
downstairs
again
into
the
dark
house
anthony
stood
still
a
moment
his
heart
beating
a
little
what
was
this
strange
errand
and
isabel
what
had
she
to
do
with
this
house
buried
away
in
the
courts
of
the
great
city
as
he
waited
he
heard
a
door
close
somewhere
behind
him
and
the
shuffling
footsteps
had
ceased
he
touched
the
hilt
of
his
knife
once
again
to
give
himself
courage
and
then
walked
slowly
across
and
rapped
on
the
door
instantly
a
voice
full
of
trembling
expectancy
cried
to
him
to
come
in
he
turned
the
handle
and
stepped
into
the
room
it
was
extremely
poorly
furnished
a
rickety
table
stood
in
the
centre
with
a
book
or
two
and
a
basin
with
a
plate
a
saucepan
hissed
and
bubbled
on
the
fire
in
the
corner
near
the
window
stood
a
poor
bed
and
to
this
anthony
attention
was
immediately
directed
by
a
voice
that
called
out
hoarsely
thank
god
sir
thank
god
sir
you
have
come
i
feared
you
would
not
anthony
stepped
towards
it
wondering
and
expectant
but
reassured
lying
in
the
bed
with
clothes
drawn
up
to
the
chin
was
the
figure
of
a
man
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
save
that
given
by
the
leaping
flames
on
the
hearth
and
anthony
could
only
make
out
the
face
of
a
man
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
the
man
stretched
a
hand
over
the
bed
clothes
as
he
came
near
and
anthony
took
it
a
little
astonished
and
received
a
strong
trembling
grip
of
apparent
excitement
and
relief
thank
god
sir
the
man
said
again
but
there
is
not
too
much
time
how
can
i
serve
you
said
anthony
sitting
on
a
chair
near
the
bedside
your
letter
spoke
of
friends
at
great
keynes
what
did
you
mean
by
that
is
the
closed
sir
asked
the
man
anxiously
stuttering
a
little
as
he
spoke
anthony
stepped
up
and
closed
it
firmly
and
then
came
back
and
sat
down
again
well
then
sir
i
believe
you
are
a
friend
of
the
priest
mr
anthony
shook
his
head
there
is
no
priest
of
that
name
that
i
know
ah
cried
the
man
and
his
voice
shook
have
i
said
too
much
you
are
anthony
norris
of
the
dower
house
and
of
the
household

am
said
anthony
but
yet
well
well

the
man
i
must
go
forward
now

know
as
james
maxwell

a
catholic
known
to
many
under
the
name
of
arthur
oldham

sore
anthony
was
silent
through
sheer
astonishment
this
then
was
the
secret
of
the
mystery
that
had
hung
round
james
so
long
the
few
times
he
had
met
him
in
town
since
his
return
it
had
been
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
ask
what
he
did
there
and
why
hubert
was
to
be
master
of
the
hall
but
there
was
something
in
james
manner
that
made
the
asking
of
such
a
question
appear
an
impossible
liberty
and
it
had
remained
unasked
well
said
the
man
in
bed
in
anxious
terror
there
is
no
mistake
is
there
i
said
nothing
said
anthony
for
astonishment
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
a
priest
and
how
can
i
serve
him
he
is
in
sore
danger
said
the
man
and
again
and
again
there
came
the
stutter
now
i
am
a
catholic
you
see
how
much
i
you
sir
i
am
the
only
one
in
this
house
i
was
entrusted
with
a
to
maxwell
to
put
him
on
his
guard
against
a
danger
that
threatens
him
i
was
to
meet
him
this
very
evening
at
five
of
the
clock
and
this
afternoon
as
i
left
my
room
i
slipped
and
so
hurt
my
foot
that
i
can
not
put
it
to
the
ground
i
dared
not
send
a
to
maxwell
for
fear
the
child
should
be
followed
i
dared
not
send
to
another
catholic
nor
indeed
did
i
know
where
to
find
one
whom
would
know
and
trust
as
he
is
new
to
us
here
but
i
had
heard
him
speak
of
his
friend
anthony
norris
who
was
at
lambeth
house
and
i
determined
sir
to
send
the
child
to
you
and
ask
you
to
do
this
service
for
your
friend
for
an
officer
of
the
archbishop
household
is
beyond
suspicion
sir
will
you
do
this
service
if
you
do
it
not
i
know
not
where
to
turn
for
help
anthony
was
silent
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
supposing
that
there
was
sedition
mixed
up
in
this
how
could
he
trust
the
man
story
how
could
he
be
certain
in
fact
that
he
was
a
catholic
at
all
he
looked
at
him
keenly
in
the
the
man
one
eye
shone
in
deep
anxiety
and
his
forehead
was
wrinkled
and
he
passed
his
hand
nervously
over
his
mouth
again
and
again
how
can
i
tell
said
anthony
that
all
this
is
true
the
man
with
an
impatient
movement
unfastened
his
shirt
at
the
neck
and
drew
up
on
a
string
that
was
round
his
neck
a
little
leather
case
sir
he
stammered
drawing
the
string
over
his
head
that
to
the
fire
and
see
what
it
is
anthony
took
it
curiously
and
holding
it
close
to
the
fire
drew
off
the
little
case
there
was
the
wax
medal
stamped
with
the
lamb
called
cried
the
man
from
the
bed
now
i
have
myself
in
your
hands
and
if
more
is
and
as
anthony
came
back
holding
the
medal
the
man
fumbled
beneath
the
pillow
and
drew
out
a
rosary
sir
do
you
believe
me
it
was
felony
to
possess
these
things
and
anthony
had
no
more
doubts
yes
he
said
and
i
ask
your
pardon
and
he
gave
back
the
but
there
is
no
sedition
in
this
sir
i
give
you
my
word
said
the
man
apparently
greatly
relieved
and
sinking
back
on
his
pillow
i
will
tell
you
all
and
you
can
judge
for
yourself
but
you
will
promise
to
be
secret
and
when
anthony
had
given
his
word
he
went
on
was
to
have
been
said
in
newman
court
on
sunday
at
number
but
that
spy
walsingham
hath
had
wind
of
it
his
men
have
been
lurking
round
there
and
it
is
not
safe
however
there
is
no
need
to
say
that
to
maxwell
he
will
understand
enough
if
you
will
give
him
a
message
of
half
a
dozen
words
from
me
roger
you
can
tell
him
that
you
saw
me
if
you
wish
to
but
ah
sir
you
give
me
your
word
to
say
no
more
to
any
one
not
even
to
maxwell
himself
for
it
is
in
a
public
place
and
then
i
will
tell
you
the
and
the
but
we
must
be
swift
because
the
time
is
near
it
is
at
five
of
the
clock
that
he
will
look
for
a
messenger
i
give
you
my
word
said
anthony
well
sir
the
place
is
papists
corner
in
the
cathedral
and
the
words
are
these
for
all
things
are
now
ready
you
know
sir
that
we
catholics
go
in
fear
of
our
lives
and
like
the
poor
hares
have
to
double
and
turn
if
we
would
escape
if
any
overhears
that
message
he
will
never
know
it
to
be
a
warning
and
it
was
for
that
that
i
asked
your
word
to
say
no
more
than
your
message
with
just
the
word
that
you
had
seen
me
yourself
you
may
tell
him
of
course
sir
that
roger
had
a
patch
over
his
eye
and
a
little
in
his
speech
and
he
will
know
it
is
from
me
then
now
sir
will
you
tell
me
what
the
message
is
and
the
place
to
be
sure
that
you
know
them
and
then
sir
it
will
be
time
to
go
and
god
bless
you
sir
god
bless
you
for
your
kindness
to
us
poor
papists
the
man
seized
anthony
gloved
hand
and
kissed
it
fervently
once
or
twice
anthony
repeated
his
instructions
carefully
he
was
more
touched
than
he
cared
to
show
by
the
evident
gratitude
and
relief
of
this
poor
terrified
catholic
is
right
sir
that
is
right
and
now
sir
if
you
please
be
gone
at
once
or
the
father
will
have
left
the
cathedral
the
child
will
be
in
the
court
below
to
show
you
the
way
out
to
the
churchyard
god
bless
you
sir
and
reward
you
for
your
kindness
and
as
anthony
went
out
of
the
room
he
heard
benedictions
mingled
with
sobs
following
him
the
woman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
so
he
took
the
from
the
landing
and
found
his
way
downstairs
again
unfastened
the
front
door
and
went
out
leaving
the
lamp
on
the
floor
the
child
was
leaning
against
the
wall
opposite
he
could
just
see
the
glimmer
of
her
face
in
the
heavy
dusk
come
my
child
he
said
show
me
the
way
to
the
churchyard
she
came
forward
and
he
began
to
follow
her
out
of
the
little
flagged
court
he
turned
round
as
he
left
the
court
and
saw
high
up
against
the
blackness
overhead
a
square
of
window
lighted
with
a
glow
from
within
and
simultaneously
there
came
the
sound
of
bolts
being
shut
in
the
door
that
he
had
just
left
evidently
the
old
woman
had
been
on
the
watch
and
was
now
barring
the
door
behind
him
it
wanted
courage
to
do
as
anthony
was
doing
but
he
was
not
lacking
in
that
it
was
not
a
small
matter
to
go
to
papists
corner
and
give
a
warning
to
a
catholic
priest
but
firstly
james
maxwell
was
his
friend
and
in
danger
secondly
anthony
had
no
sympathy
with
religious
persecution
and
thirdly
as
has
been
seen
the
last
year
had
made
a
really
deep
impression
upon
him
he
was
more
favourably
inclined
to
the
catholic
cause
than
he
had
ever
imagined
to
be
possible
as
he
followed
the
child
through
the
labyrinth
of
passages
passing
every
now
and
then
the
lighted
front
of
a
house
or
a
little
group
of
idlers
for
the
rain
had
now
ceased
who
stared
to
see
this
gentleman
in
such
company
his
head
was
whirling
with
questions
and
conjectures
was
it
not
after
all
a
dishonourable
act
to
the
archbishop
in
whose
service
he
was
thus
to
take
the
side
of
the
papists
but
that
it
was
too
late
to
consider
how
strange
that
james
maxwell
was
a
priest
that
of
course
accounted
at
once
for
his
long
absence
no
doubt
in
the
seminary
abroad
and
his
ultimate
return
and
for
hubert
inheriting
the
estates
and
then
he
passed
on
to
reflect
as
he
had
done
a
hundred
times
before
on
this
wonderful
religion
that
allured
men
from
home
and
wealth
and
friends
and
sent
them
rejoicing
to
penury
suspicion
hatred
peril
and
death
itself
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
sake
suddenly
he
found
himself
in
the
open
space
opposite
the
cathedral
the
child
had
again
disappeared
it
was
less
dark
here
the
leaden
sky
overhead
still
glimmered
with
a
pale
sunset
light
and
many
shone
out
from
within
he
passed
round
the
south
side
of
the
cathedral
and
entered
the
western
door
the
building
was
full
of
deep
gloom
only
pricked
here
and
there
by
an
or
two
that
would
presently
be
extinguished
when
the
cathedral
was
closed
the
air
was
full
of
a
faint
sound
made
up
from
echoes
of
the
outside
world
and
the
footsteps
of
a
few
people
who
still
lingered
in
groups
here
and
there
in
the
aisles
and
talked
among
themselves
the
columns
rose
up
in
slender
bundles
and
faded
into
the
pale
gloom
overhead
as
he
crossed
the
nave
on
the
way
to
papists
corner
far
away
to
the
east
rose
the
dark
carving
of
the
stalls
against
the
glimmering
stone
beyond
it
was
like
some
vast
hall
of
the
dead
the
noise
of
the
footsteps
seemed
like
an
insolent
intrusion
on
this
temple
of
silence
and
the
religious
stillness
had
an
active
and
sombre
character
of
its
own
more
eloquent
and
impressive
than
all
the
tumult
that
man
could
make
as
anthony
came
to
papists
corner
he
saw
a
very
tall
solitary
figure
passing
slowly
from
east
to
west
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
faces
so
he
went
towards
it
so
that
at
the
next
turn
they
would
meet
face
to
face
when
he
was
within
two
or
three
steps
the
man
before
him
turned
abruptly
and
anthony
immediately
put
out
his
hand
smiling
arthur
oldham
he
said
the
man
started
and
peered
curiously
through
the
gloom
at
him
why
anthony
he
exclaimed
and
took
his
hand
what
is
your
business
here
and
they
began
slowly
to
walk
westwards
together
i
am
come
to
meet
oldham
he
said
and
to
give
him
a
message
and
this
is
it
for
all
things
are
now
ready
my
dear
boy
said
james
stopping
short
you
must
forgive
me
but
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
by
that
i
come
from
roger
said
anthony
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
has
had
an
accident
and
sent
for
me
mr
roger
said
james
interrogatively
yes
said
anthony
he
hath
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
stutters
somewhat
james
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
my
dear
boy
he
said
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
you
know
what
it
means
then
why
yes
said
anthony
and
you
a
protestant
and
in
the
archbishop
household
why
yes
said
anthony
and
a
christian
and
your
friend
god
bless
you
anthony
said
the
priest
and
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
they
were
passing
out
now
under
the
west
door
and
stood
together
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
lights
down
ludgate
hill
the
houses
about
amen
court
stood
up
against
the
sky
to
their
right
i
must
not
stay
said
anthony
i
must
fetch
my
horse
and
be
back
at
lambeth
for
evening
prayers
at
six
he
is
stabled
at
the
palace
here
well
well
said
the
priest
i
thank
god
that
there
are
true
hearts
like
yours
god
bless
you
again
my
dear
boy
and
and
make
you
one
of
us
some
day
anthony
smiled
at
him
a
little
tremulously
for
the
gratitude
and
the
blessing
of
this
man
was
dear
to
him
and
after
another
hand
grasp
he
turned
away
to
the
right
leaving
the
priest
still
half
under
the
shadow
of
the
door
looking
after
him
he
had
done
his
errand
promptly
and
discreetly
chapter
viii
the
newman
court
lay
dark
and
silent
under
the
stars
on
sunday
morning
a
little
after
four
the
gloomy
weather
of
the
last
three
or
four
days
had
passed
off
in
heavy
battalions
of
sullen
sunset
clouds
on
the
preceding
evening
and
the
air
was
full
of
frost
by
midnight
thin
ice
was
lying
everywhere
pendants
of
it
were
beginning
to
form
on
the
overhanging
eaves
and
streaks
of
it
between
the
that
paved
the
court
the
great
city
lay
in
a
frosty
stillness
as
of
death
the
patrol
passed
along
cheapside
forty
yards
away
from
the
entrance
of
the
court
a
little
after
three
and
a
watchman
had
cried
out
half
an
hour
later
that
it
was
a
clear
night
and
then
he
too
had
gone
his
way
the
court
itself
was
a
little
rectangular
enclosure
with
two
entrances
one
to
the
north
beneath
the
arch
of
a
stable
that
gave
on
to
newman
passage
which
in
its
turn
opened
on
to
giles
lane
that
led
to
cheapside
the
other
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
side
led
by
a
labyrinth
of
passages
down
in
the
direction
of
the
wharfs
to
the
west
of
london
bridge
there
were
three
houses
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
from
newman
passage
the
back
of
a
faced
them
on
the
other
long
side
with
the
door
beyond
and
the
other
two
sides
were
respectively
formed
by
the
archway
of
the
stable
with
a
loft
over
it
and
a
blank
high
wall
at
the
opposite
end
a
few
minutes
after
four
the
figure
of
a
woman
suddenly
appeared
soundlessly
in
the
arch
under
the
stables
and
after
standing
there
a
moment
advanced
along
the
front
of
the
houses
till
she
reached
the
third
door
she
stood
here
a
moment
in
silence
listening
and
looking
towards
the
doorway
opposite
and
then
rapped
gently
with
her
eleven
or
twelve
times
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
showing
only
darkness
within
she
stepped
in
and
it
closed
silently
behind
her
then
the
minutes
slipped
away
again
in
undisturbed
silence
at
about
twenty
minutes
to
five
the
figure
of
a
very
tall
man
dressed
as
a
layman
slipped
in
through
the
door
that
led
towards
the
river
and
advanced
to
the
door
where
he
tapped
in
the
same
manner
as
the
woman
before
him
and
was
admitted
at
once
after
that
people
began
to
come
more
frequently
some
hesitating
and
looking
about
them
as
they
entered
the
court
some
slipping
straight
through
without
a
pause
and
going
to
the
door
which
opened
and
shut
noiselessly
as
each
tapped
and
was
admitted
sometimes
two
or
three
would
come
together
sometimes
singly
but
by
five
about
twenty
or
thirty
persons
had
come
and
been
engulfed
by
the
blackness
that
showed
each
time
the
door
opened
while
no
glimmer
of
light
from
any
of
the
windows
betrayed
the
presence
of
any
living
soul
within
at
five
the
stream
stopped
the
little
court
lay
as
silent
under
the
stars
again
as
an
hour
before
it
was
a
night
of
breathless
stillness
there
was
no
dripping
from
the
eaves
no
sound
of
wheels
or
hoofs
from
the
city
only
once
or
twice
came
the
long
howl
of
a
dog
across
the
roofs
ten
minutes
passed
away
then
without
a
sound
a
face
appeared
like
a
pale
floating
patch
in
the
dark
door
that
opened
on
to
the
court
it
remained
hung
like
a
mask
in
the
darkness
for
at
least
a
minute
and
then
a
man
stepped
through
on
to
the
cobblestones
something
on
his
head
glimmered
sharply
in
the
starlight
and
there
was
the
same
sparkle
at
the
end
of
a
pole
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
he
turned
and
nodded
and
three
or
four
men
appeared
behind
him
then
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
archway
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
appeared
a
similar
group
once
a
man
slipped
on
the
frozen
stones
and
cursed
under
his
breath
and
the
leader
turned
on
him
with
a
fierce
indrawing
of
his
breath
but
no
word
was
spoken
then
through
both
entrances
streamed
dark
figures
each
with
a
steely
glitter
on
head
and
breast
and
with
something
that
shone
in
their
hands
till
the
little
court
seemed
half
full
of
armed
men
but
the
silence
was
still
formidable
in
its
depth
the
two
leaders
came
together
to
the
door
of
the
third
house
and
their
heads
were
together
and
a
few
sibilant
consonants
escaped
them
the
breath
of
the
men
that
stood
out
under
the
starlight
went
up
like
smoke
in
the
air
it
was
now
a
five
three
notes
of
a
sounded
behind
the
house
and
then
without
any
further
attempt
at
silence
the
man
who
had
entered
the
court
first
advanced
to
the
door
and
struck
three
or
four
thundering
blows
on
it
with
a
mace
and
shouted
in
a
resonant
voice
open
in
the
queen
name
the
men
relaxed
their
cautious
attitudes
and
some
grounded
their
weapons
others
began
to
talk
in
low
voices
a
small
party
advanced
nearer
their
leaders
with
weapons
axes
and
halberds
uplifted
by
now
the
blows
were
thundering
on
the
door
and
the
same
shattering
voice
cried
again
and
again
open
in
the
queen
name
open
in
the
queen
name
the
middle
house
of
the
three
was
unoccupied
but
the
windows
of
the
house
next
the
stable
and
the
windows
in
the
loft
over
the
archway
where
the
slept
suddenly
were
illuminated
latches
were
lifted
the
windows
thrust
open
and
heads
out
of
them
then
one
or
two
more
pursuivants
came
up
the
dark
passage
bearing
flaming
torches
with
them
a
figure
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
blank
wall
at
the
end
and
pointed
and
shouted
the
in
a
moment
more
appeared
in
their
archway
and
one
or
two
persons
came
out
of
the
house
next
the
stable
queerly
habited
in
cloaks
and
hats
over
their
the
din
was
now
tremendous
the
questions
and
answers
shouted
to
and
fro
were
scarcely
audible
under
the
thunder
that
pealed
from
the
battered
door
a
party
had
advanced
to
it
and
were
raining
blows
upon
the
lock
and
hinges
the
court
was
full
of
a
ruddy
glare
that
blazed
on
the
and
pikes
of
the
men
and
the
bellowing
and
the
crashes
and
the
smoke
together
went
up
into
the
night
air
as
from
the
infernal
pit
it
was
a
hellish
transformation
from
the
deathly
stillness
of
a
few
minutes
a
massacre
of
the
sweet
night
silence
and
yet
the
house
where
the
little
silent
stream
of
dark
figures
had
been
swallowed
up
rose
up
high
above
the
smoky
cauldron
black
dark
and
irresponsive
there
rose
a
shrill
howling
from
behind
the
house
and
the
figure
on
the
top
of
the
wall
capered
and
gesticulated
again
then
footsteps
came
running
up
the
passage
and
a
pursuivant
thrust
his
way
through
to
the
leaders
and
in
a
moment
or
two
above
the
din
a
sharp
word
was
given
and
three
or
four
men
hurried
out
through
the
doorway
by
which
the
man
had
come
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
hinges
of
the
door
gave
way
the
whole
crashed
inwards
and
the
attacking
party
poured
into
the
dark
entrance
hall
beyond
by
this
time
the
noise
had
wakened
many
in
the
houses
round
and
lights
were
beginning
to
shine
from
the
high
windows
invisible
before
and
a
concourse
of
people
to
press
in
from
all
sides
the
approaches
had
all
been
guarded
but
at
the
crash
of
the
door
some
of
the
sentries
round
the
nearer
corners
hurried
into
the
court
and
the
crowd
poured
after
them
and
by
the
time
that
the
officers
and
men
had
disappeared
into
the
house
their
places
had
been
filled
by
the
spectators
and
the
little
court
was
again
full
of
a
swaying
seething
shouting
mass
of
men
with
a
few
women
with
hoods
and
cloaks
among
them
inquiries
and
information
were
yelled
to
and
fro
it
was
a
nest
of
papists
a
wasp
nest
was
being
smoked
out
what
harm
had
they
done
it
was
a
murder
two
women
had
had
their
throats
no
no
it
was
a
papists
den
a
well
god
save
her
grace
and
rid
her
of
her
enemies
with
these
damned
spaniards
everywhere
england
was
going
to
they
had
escaped
at
the
back
no
they
tried
that
way
but
it
was
there
were
over
fifty
papists
some
said
in
that
it
was
a
plot
mary
was
mixed
up
in
it
the
queen
was
to
be
blown
up
with
powder
like
poor
darnley
the
barrels
were
all
stored
no
no
no
it
was
nothing
but
a
who
was
the
priest
well
they
would
see
him
at
tyburn
on
a
hurdle
and
serve
him
right
with
his
treasonable
no
no
they
had
had
enough
of
campion
had
died
like
a
man
and
an
englishman
too
praying
for
his
queen
the
incessant
battle
and
roar
went
up
meanwhile
lights
were
beginning
to
shine
everywhere
in
the
dark
house
a
man
with
a
torch
was
standing
in
a
smoky
glare
half
way
up
the
stairs
seen
through
the
door
and
the
interior
of
the
plain
hall
was
illuminated
then
the
leaded
panes
overhead
were
beginning
to
shine
out
steel
caps
moved
to
and
fro
gigantic
shadows
wavered
the
shadow
of
a
halberd
head
went
across
a
curtain
at
one
of
the
lower
windows
a
man
threw
open
a
window
and
shouted
instructions
to
the
sentry
left
at
the
door
who
in
answer
shook
his
head
and
pointed
to
the
bellowing
crowd
the
man
at
the
window
made
a
furious
gesture
and
disappeared
the
illumination
began
to
climb
higher
and
higher
as
the
searchers
mounted
from
floor
to
floor
thin
smoke
began
to
go
up
from
one
or
two
of
the
chimneys
in
the
frosty
air
they
were
lighting
straw
to
bring
down
any
fugitives
concealed
in
the
chimneys
then
the
sound
of
heavy
blows
began
to
ring
out
they
were
testing
the
walls
everywhere
for
there
was
a
sound
of
rending
wood
as
the
flooring
was
torn
up
then
over
the
parapet
against
the
stairs
looked
a
face
of
a
pursuivant
the
crowd
below
yelled
and
pointed
at
first
thinking
he
was
a
fugitive
but
he
grinned
down
at
them
and
disappeared
then
at
last
came
an
exultant
shout
then
a
breathless
silence
then
the
crowd
began
to
question
and
answer
again
they
had
caught
the
priest
no
the
priest
had
escaped
damn
him
it
was
half
a
dozen
women
no
no
they
had
had
the
women
ten
minutes
ago
in
a
room
at
the
what
fools
these
pursuivants
were
they
had
found
the
chapel
and
the
what
a
show
it
would
all
make
at
the
trial
ah
ah
it
was
the
priest
after
all
those
nearest
the
door
saw
the
man
with
the
torch
on
the
stairs
stand
back
a
little
and
then
a
dismal
little
procession
began
to
appear
round
the
turn
first
came
a
couple
of
armed
men
looking
behind
them
every
now
and
then
then
a
group
of
half
a
dozen
women
whom
they
had
found
almost
immediately
but
had
been
keeping
for
the
last
few
minutes
in
a
room
upstairs
then
a
couple
more
men
then
there
was
a
little
space
and
then
more
constables
and
more
prisoners
each
male
prisoner
was
guarded
by
two
men
the
women
were
in
groups
all
these
came
out
to
the
court
the
crowd
began
to
sway
back
against
the
walls
pointing
and
crying
out
and
a
lane
with
living
walls
was
formed
towards
the
archway
that
opened
into
newman
passage
when
the
last
pursuivants
who
brought
up
the
rear
had
reached
the
door
an
officer
who
had
been
leaning
from
a
window
with
the
pale
face
of
lackington
peering
over
his
shoulder
gave
a
sharp
order
and
the
procession
halted
the
women
numbering
fourteen
or
fifteen
were
placed
in
a
group
with
some
eight
men
in
hollow
square
round
them
then
came
a
dozen
men
each
with
a
pursuivant
on
either
side
but
plainly
they
were
not
all
come
they
were
still
waiting
for
something
the
officer
and
lackington
disappeared
from
the
window
and
for
a
moment
too
the
crowd
was
quiet
a
murmur
of
excitement
began
to
rise
again
as
another
group
was
seen
descending
the
stairs
within
the
officer
came
first
looking
back
and
talking
as
he
came
then
followed
two
pursuivants
with
halberds
and
immediately
behind
them
followed
by
yet
two
men
walked
james
maxwell
in
crimson
vestments
all
disordered
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
comely
head
towering
above
the
heads
of
the
guard
the
crowd
surged
forward
yelling
and
the
men
at
the
door
grounded
their
halberds
sharply
on
the
feet
of
the
front
row
of
spectators
as
the
priest
reached
the
door
a
shrill
cry
either
from
a
boy
or
a
woman
pierced
the
roaring
of
the
mob
god
bless
you
father
and
as
he
heard
it
he
turned
and
smiled
serenely
his
face
was
white
and
there
was
a
little
trickle
of
blood
run
down
across
it
from
some
wound
in
his
head
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
turned
towards
him
as
he
came
out
and
again
he
smiled
and
nodded
at
them
and
so
the
catholics
with
their
priest
stood
a
moment
in
that
deafening
tumult
of
revilings
before
the
officer
gave
the
word
to
advance
then
the
procession
set
forward
through
the
archway
the
crowd
pressing
back
before
them
like
the
recoil
of
a
wave
and
surging
after
them
again
in
the
wake
high
over
the
heads
of
all
moved
the
steel
halberds
shining
like
grim
emblems
of
power
the
torches
tossed
up
and
down
and
threw
monstrous
stalking
shadows
on
the
walls
as
they
passed
the
steel
caps
edged
the
procession
like
an
impenetrable
hedge
and
last
moved
the
priest
as
if
in
some
church
function
but
with
a
bristling
barrier
about
him
then
came
the
mob
pouring
along
the
narrow
passages
jostling
cursing
reviling
swelled
every
moment
by
new
arrivals
dashing
down
the
alleys
and
courts
that
gave
on
the
thoroughfare
and
so
with
tramp
and
ring
of
steel
the
pageant
went
forward
on
its
way
of
sorrows
before
six
newman
court
was
empty
again
except
for
one
armed
figure
that
stood
before
the
shattered
door
of
no
to
guard
it
inside
the
house
was
dark
again
except
in
one
room
high
up
where
the
altar
had
stood
here
the
thick
curtains
against
the
glass
had
been
torn
down
and
the
window
was
illuminated
every
now
and
again
the
shadows
on
the
ceiling
stirred
a
little
as
if
the
candle
was
being
moved
and
once
the
window
opened
and
a
pale
smooth
face
looked
out
for
a
moment
and
then
withdrew
again
then
the
light
disappeared
altogether
and
presently
shone
out
in
another
room
on
the
same
floor
then
again
after
an
half
an
hour
or
so
it
was
darkened
and
again
reappeared
on
the
floor
below
and
so
it
went
on
from
room
to
room
until
the
noises
of
the
waking
city
began
and
the
stars
paled
and
expired
over
the
smokeless
town
the
sky
began
to
glow
clear
and
brilliant
the
crowing
of
cocks
awoke
here
and
there
a
church
bell
or
two
began
to
sound
far
away
over
the
roofs
the
pale
blue
overhead
grew
more
and
more
luminous
the
candle
went
out
on
the
first
floor
the
man
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
the
growing
dawn
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
lackington
came
down
carrying
a
small
valise
apparently
full
to
bursting
he
looked
paler
than
usual
and
a
little
for
want
of
sleep
he
came
out
and
stood
by
the
soldier
and
looked
about
him
everywhere
the
court
showed
signs
of
the
night
tumult
crumbled
ice
from
broken
icicles
and
trampled
frozen
pools
lay
powdered
on
the
stones
here
and
there
on
the
walls
were
great
smears
of
black
from
the
torches
and
even
one
or
two
torn
bits
of
stuff
and
a
crushed
hat
marked
where
the
pressure
had
been
fiercest
most
eloquent
of
all
was
the
splintered
door
behind
him
still
held
fast
by
one
stout
bolt
but
leaning
crookedly
against
the
dinted
wall
of
the
interior
a
good
night
work
friend
said
lackington
to
the
man
another
hive
taken
and
here
and
he
tapped
his
valise
here
i
bear
the
best
of
the
honey
the
soldier
looked
heavily
at
the
bag
he
was
tired
too
and
he
did
not
care
for
this
kind
of
work
well
said
lackington
again
i
must
be
getting
home
safe
keep
the
door
you
shall
be
relieved
in
one
hour
the
soldier
nodded
at
him
but
still
said
nothing
and
lackington
lifted
the
valise
and
went
off
too
under
the
archway
that
same
morning
lady
maxwell
in
her
room
in
the
hall
at
great
keynes
awoke
early
before
dawn
with
a
start
she
had
had
a
dream
but
could
not
remember
what
it
was
except
that
her
son
james
was
in
it
and
seemed
to
be
in
trouble
he
was
calling
on
her
to
save
him
she
thought
and
awoke
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
often
dreamt
of
him
at
this
time
for
the
life
of
a
seminary
priest
was
laid
with
snares
and
dangers
but
this
dream
seemed
worse
than
all
she
struck
a
light
and
looked
timidly
round
the
room
it
seemed
still
ringing
with
his
voice
a
great
tapestry
in
a
frame
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
act√¶on
followed
by
his
hounds
the
hunter
panted
as
he
ran
and
was
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
and
the
dogs
streamed
behind
him
down
a
little
hill
so
strong
was
the
dream
upon
the
old
lady
that
she
felt
restless
and
presently
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
opened
a
shutter
to
look
out
a
white
statue
or
two
beyond
the
terrace
glimmered
in
the
dusk
and
the
stars
were
bright
in
the
clear
frosty
night
overhead
she
closed
the
shutter
and
went
back
again
to
bed
but
could
not
sleep
again
and
again
as
she
was
dozing
off
something
would
startle
her
wide
awake
again
sometimes
it
was
a
glimpse
of
james
face
sometimes
he
seemed
to
be
hurrying
away
from
her
down
an
endless
passage
with
closed
doors
he
was
dressed
in
something
crimson
she
tried
to
cry
out
her
voice
would
not
rise
above
a
whisper
sometimes
it
was
the
dream
of
his
voice
and
once
she
started
up
crying
out
i
am
coming
my
son
then
at
last
she
awoke
again
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
along
the
corridor
outside
and
stared
fearfully
at
the
door
to
see
what
would
enter
but
it
was
only
the
maid
come
to
call
her
mistress
lady
maxwell
watched
her
as
she
opened
the
shutters
that
now
glimmered
through
their
cracks
and
let
a
great
flood
of
light
into
the
room
from
the
clear
shining
morning
outside
it
is
a
frosty
morning
my
lady
said
the
maid
send
one
of
the
men
down
to
mistress
torridon
said
lady
maxwell
and
ask
her
to
come
here
as
soon
as
it
is
convenient
say
i
am
well
but
would
like
to
see
her
when
she
can
come
there
was
no
priest
in
the
house
that
sunday
so
there
could
be
no
mass
and
on
these
occasions
mistress
margaret
usually
stayed
at
the
dower
house
until
after
dinner
but
this
morning
she
came
up
within
half
an
hour
of
receiving
the
message
she
did
not
pretend
to
despise
her
sister
terror
or
call
it
superstitious
mary
she
said
taking
her
sister
jewelled
old
fingers
into
her
own
two
hands
we
must
leave
all
this
to
the
good
god
it
may
mean
much
or
little
or
nothing
he
only
knows
but
at
least
we
may
pray
let
me
tell
isabel
a
child
prayers
are
mighty
with
him
and
she
has
the
soul
of
a
little
child
still
so
isabel
was
told
and
after
church
she
came
up
to
dine
at
the
hall
and
spend
the
day
there
for
lady
maxwell
was
thoroughly
nervous
and
upset
she
trembled
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
cried
out
when
one
of
the
men
came
into
the
room
suddenly
isabel
went
again
to
evening
prayer
at
three
but
could
not
keep
her
thoughts
off
the
strange
nervous
horror
at
the
hall
though
it
seemed
to
rest
on
no
better
foundation
than
the
waking
dreams
of
an
old
lady
and
her
mind
strayed
away
continually
from
the
darkening
chapel
in
which
she
sat
so
near
where
sir
nicholas
himself
lay
to
the
upstairs
parlour
where
the
widow
sat
shaken
and
trembling
at
her
own
curious
fancies
about
her
dear
son
bodder
sermon
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
isabel
was
able
to
get
away
and
hurry
back
to
the
hall
she
found
the
old
ladies
as
she
had
left
them
in
the
little
lady
maxwell
sitting
on
the
near
the
harp
preoccupied
and
apparently
listening
for
something
she
knew
not
what
mistress
margaret
was
sitting
in
a
tall
padded
porter
chair
reading
aloud
from
an
old
english
mystic
but
her
sister
was
paying
no
attention
and
looked
strangely
at
the
girl
as
she
came
in
isabel
sat
down
near
the
fire
and
listened
and
as
she
listened
the
memory
of
that
other
day
years
ago
came
to
her
when
she
sat
once
before
with
these
two
ladies
in
the
same
room
and
mistress
margaret
read
to
them
and
the
letter
came
from
sir
nicholas
and
then
the
sudden
clamour
from
the
village
so
now
she
sat
with
terror
darkening
over
her
glancing
now
and
again
at
that
white
expectant
face
and
herself
listening
for
the
first
rumour
of
the
dreadful
interruption
that
she
now
knew
must
come
the
goodness
of
god
read
the
old
nun
is
the
highest
prayer
and
it
cometh
down
to
the
lowest
part
of
our
need
it
quickeneth
our
soul
and
bringeth
it
on
life
and
maketh
it
for
to
waxen
in
grace
and
virtue
it
is
nearest
in
nature
and
readiest
in
grace
for
it
is
the
same
grace
that
the
soul
seeketh
and
ever
shall
seek
till
we
know
verily
that
he
hath
us
all
in
himself
enclosed
for
he
hath
no
despite
of
that
he
hath
made
nor
hath
he
any
disdain
to
serve
us
at
the
simplest
office
that
to
our
body
belongeth
in
nature
for
love
of
the
soul
that
he
hath
made
to
his
own
likeness
for
as
the
body
is
clad
in
the
clothes
and
the
flesh
in
the
skin
and
the
bones
in
the
flesh
and
the
heart
in
the
whole
so
are
we
soul
and
body
clad
in
the
goodness
of
god
and
enclosed
yea
and
more
homely
for
all
these
may
waste
and
wear
away
but
the
goodness
of
god
is
ever
whole
and
more
near
to
us
without
any
likeness
for
truly
our
lover
desireth
that
our
soul
cleave
to
him
with
all
its
might
and
that
we
be
evermore
cleaving
to
his
goodness
for
of
all
things
that
heart
may
think
this
most
pleaseth
god
and
soonest
speedeth
us
for
our
soul
is
so
specially
loved
of
him
that
is
highest
that
it
overpasseth
the
knowing
of
all
creatures
hush
said
lady
maxwell
suddenly
on
her
feet
with
a
lifted
hand
there
was
a
breathless
silence
in
the
room
isabel
heart
beat
thick
and
heavy
and
her
eyes
grew
large
with
expectancy
it
was
a
windless
frosty
night
again
and
the
ivy
outside
on
the
wall
and
the
laurels
in
the
garden
seemed
to
be
silently
listening
too
mary
mary
began
her
sister
you
but
the
old
lady
lifted
her
hand
a
little
higher
and
silence
fell
again
then
far
away
in
the
direction
of
the
london
road
came
the
clear
beat
of
the
hoofs
of
a
galloping
horse
lady
maxwell
bowed
her
head
and
her
hand
slowly
sank
to
her
side
the
other
two
stood
up
and
remained
still
while
the
beat
of
the
hoofs
grew
and
grew
in
intensity
on
the
frozen
road
the
front
door
said
lady
maxwell
mistress
margaret
slipped
from
the
room
and
went
downstairs
isabel
took
a
step
or
two
forward
but
was
checked
by
the
old
lady
uplifted
hand
again
and
again
there
was
a
breathless
silence
save
for
the
beat
of
the
hoofs
now
close
and
imminent
a
moment
later
the
front
door
was
opened
and
a
great
flood
of
cold
air
swept
up
the
passages
the
portrait
of
sir
nicholas
in
the
hall
downstairs
lifted
and
rattled
against
the
wall
then
came
the
clatter
on
the
paved
court
and
the
sound
of
a
horse
suddenly
checked
with
the
slipping
up
of
hoofs
and
the
jingle
and
rattle
of
chains
and
stirrups
there
were
voices
in
the
hall
below
and
a
man
deep
tones
then
came
steps
ascending
lady
maxwell
still
stood
perfectly
rigid
by
the
window
waiting
and
isabel
stared
with
white
face
and
great
open
eyes
at
the
door
outside
the
flame
of
a
lamp
on
the
wall
was
blowing
about
furiously
in
the
draught
then
a
stranger
stepped
into
the
room
evidently
a
gentleman
he
bowed
to
the
two
ladies
and
stood
with
the
rime
on
his
boots
and
a
whip
in
his
hand
a
little
exhausted
and
disordered
by
hard
riding
lady
maxwell
he
said
lady
maxwell
bowed
a
little
i
come
with
news
of
your
son
madam
the
priest
he
is
alive
and
well
but
he
is
in
trouble
he
was
taken
this
morning
in
his
and
is
in
the
marshalsea
lady
maxwell
lips
moved
a
little
but
no
sound
came
he
was
betrayed
madam
by
a
friend
he
and
thirty
other
catholics
were
taken
all
together
at
mass
then
lady
maxwell
spoke
and
her
voice
was
dead
and
hard
the
friend
sir
what
was
his
name
the
traitor
name
madam
is
anthony
norris
the
room
turned
suddenly
dark
to
isabel
eyes
and
she
put
up
her
hand
and
tore
at
the
collar
round
her
throat
oh
no
no
no
no
she
cried
and
tottered
a
step
or
two
forward
and
stood
swaying
lady
maxwell
looked
from
one
to
another
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
nothing
and
her
lips
stirred
again
mistress
margaret
who
had
followed
the
stranger
up
and
who
stood
now
behind
him
at
the
door
came
forward
to
isabel
with
a
little
cry
with
her
hands
trembling
before
her
but
before
she
could
reach
her
lady
maxwell
herself
came
swiftly
forward
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
arms
stretched
out
towards
the
girl
who
still
stood
dazed
and
swaying
more
and
more
my
poor
poor
child
said
lady
maxwell
and
caught
her
as
she
fell
chapter
ix
from
fulham
to
greenwich
anthony
in
london
strangely
enough
heard
nothing
of
the
arrest
on
the
sunday
except
a
rumour
at
supper
that
some
papists
had
been
taken
it
had
sufficient
effect
on
his
mind
to
make
him
congratulate
himself
that
he
had
been
able
to
warn
his
friend
last
week
at
dinner
on
monday
there
were
a
few
guests
and
among
them
one
sir
richard
barkley
afterwards
lieutenant
of
the
tower
he
sat
at
the
archbishop
table
but
anthony
place
on
the
steward
left
hand
brought
him
very
close
to
the
end
of
the
first
table
where
sir
richard
sat
dinner
was
half
way
through
when
scot
who
was
talking
to
anthony
was
suddenly
silent
and
lifted
his
hand
as
if
to
check
the
conversation
a
moment
i
saw
them
myself
said
sir
richard
voice
just
behind
what
is
it
whispered
anthony
the
catholics
answered
the
steward
they
were
taken
in
newman
court
off
cheapside
went
on
the
voice
nearly
thirty
with
one
of
their
priests
at
mass
in
his
trinkets
too
oldham
his
name
is
there
was
a
sudden
crash
of
a
chair
fallen
backwards
and
anthony
was
standing
by
the
officer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
richard
barkley
he
said
and
a
dead
silence
fell
in
the
but
is
that
the
name
of
the
priest
that
was
taken
yesterday
sir
richard
looked
astonished
at
the
apparent
insolence
of
this
young
official
yes
sir
he
said
shortly
then
then
began
anthony
but
stopped
bowed
low
to
the
archbishop
and
went
straight
out
of
the
hall
scot
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
when
he
returned
late
that
night
anthony
face
was
white
and
distracted
he
came
in
and
stood
by
the
fire
and
stared
at
him
with
a
dazed
air
you
are
to
come
to
his
grace
said
the
steward
looking
at
him
in
silence
anthony
nodded
without
speaking
and
turned
away
then
you
can
not
tell
me
anything
said
scot
the
other
shook
his
head
impatiently
and
walked
towards
the
inner
door
the
archbishop
was
sincerely
shocked
at
the
sight
of
his
young
officer
as
he
came
in
and
stood
before
the
table
staring
with
bewildered
eyes
with
his
dress
splashed
and
disordered
and
his
hands
still
holding
the
whip
and
gloves
he
made
him
sit
down
at
once
and
after
anthony
had
drunk
a
glass
of
wine
he
made
him
tell
his
story
and
what
he
had
done
that
day
he
had
been
to
the
marshalsea
it
was
true
oldham
was
there
and
had
been
examined
young
had
conducted
the
house
at
newman
court
was
guarded
the
house
behind
bow
church
was
barred
and
shut
up
and
the
people
seemed
gone
he
could
not
get
a
word
through
to
oldham
though
he
had
tried
heavy
and
that
was
all
anthony
spoke
with
the
same
dazed
air
in
short
broken
sentences
but
became
more
himself
as
the
wine
and
the
fire
warmed
him
and
by
the
time
he
had
finished
he
had
recovered
himself
enough
to
entreat
the
archbishop
to
help
him
it
is
useless
said
the
old
man
what
can
i
do
i
have
no
power
and
and
he
is
a
popish
priest
how
can
i
interfere
my
lord
cried
anthony
desperately
flushed
and
entreating
all
has
been
done
through
treachery
do
you
not
see
it
i
have
been
a
brainless
fool
that
man
behind
bow
church
was
a
spy
for
christ
sake
help
us
my
lord
grindal
looked
into
the
lad
great
bright
eyes
sighed
and
threw
out
his
hands
despairingly
it
is
useless
indeed
it
is
useless
norris
but
i
will
tell
you
all
that
i
can
do
i
will
give
you
a
letter
to
sir
francis
walsingham
i
was
with
him
abroad
as
you
know
in
the
popish
times
of
mary
and
he
is
still
in
some
sort
a
friend
of
mine
but
you
must
remember
that
he
is
a
strong
protestant
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
he
will
help
you
now
go
to
bed
dear
lad
you
are
worn
out
anthony
knelt
for
the
old
man
blessing
and
left
the
room
the
interview
next
day
was
more
formidable
than
he
had
expected
he
was
at
the
secretary
house
by
ten
and
waited
below
while
the
archbishop
letter
was
taken
up
the
servant
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
and
asked
him
to
follow
and
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
but
with
a
clear
head
again
this
morning
and
every
faculty
tense
he
went
upstairs
after
him
and
was
ushered
into
the
room
where
walsingham
sat
at
a
table
there
was
silence
as
the
two
bowed
but
sir
francis
did
not
offer
to
rise
but
sat
with
the
archbishop
letter
in
his
hand
glancing
through
it
again
as
the
other
stood
and
waited
i
understand
said
the
secretary
at
last
and
his
voice
was
dry
and
unsympathetic
i
understand
from
his
grace
letter
that
you
desire
to
aid
a
popish
priest
called
oldham
or
maxwell
arrested
at
mass
on
sunday
morning
in
newman
court
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
in
what
way
you
desire
to
aid
him
i
can
be
more
plain
in
my
answer
you
do
not
desire
i
hope
norris
anything
but
justice
and
a
fair
trial
for
your
friend
anthony
cleared
his
throat
before
answering
i
he
is
my
friend
as
you
say
sir
francis
and
and
he
hath
been
caught
by
foul
means
i
myself
was
used
as
i
have
little
doubt
in
his
capture
surely
there
is
no
justice
sir
in
betraying
a
man
by
means
of
his
friend
and
anthony
described
the
ruse
that
had
brought
it
all
about
sir
francis
listened
to
him
coldly
but
there
came
the
faintest
spark
of
amusement
into
his
large
sad
eyes
surely
norris
he
said
it
was
somewhat
simple
and
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
all
is
as
you
say
and
that
the
poor
stuttering
cripple
with
a
patch
was
as
sound
and
had
as
good
sight
and
power
of
speech
as
you
and
i
but
the
plan
was
it
seems
if
you
will
forgive
me
not
so
simple
as
yourself
it
would
be
passing
strange
surely
that
the
man
if
a
friend
of
the
priest
could
find
no
catholic
to
take
his
message
but
not
at
all
strange
if
he
were
his
enemy
i
do
not
think
sincerely
sir
that
it
would
have
deceived
me
but
that
is
not
now
the
point
he
is
taken
now
fairly
or
foully
and
what
was
it
you
wished
me
to
do
i
hoped
said
anthony
in
rising
indignation
at
this
insolence
that
you
would
help
me
in
some
way
to
undo
this
foul
unjustice
surely
sir
it
can
not
be
right
to
take
advantage
of
such
knavish
tricks
good
norris
said
the
secretary
we
are
not
playing
a
game
with
rules
that
must
not
be
broken
but
we
are
trying
to
serve
justice
his
voice
rose
a
little
in
sincere
enthusiasm
and
to
put
down
all
false
practices
whether
in
religion
or
state
against
god
or
the
prince
surely
the
point
for
you
and
me
is
not
ought
this
gentleman
to
have
been
taken
in
the
manner
he
was
but
being
taken
is
he
innocent
or
guilty
then
you
will
not
help
me
i
will
certainly
not
help
you
to
defeat
justice
said
the
other
norris
you
are
a
young
man
and
while
your
friendship
does
your
heart
credit
your
manner
of
forwarding
its
claims
does
not
equally
commend
your
head
i
counsel
you
to
be
wary
in
your
speech
and
actions
or
they
may
bring
you
into
trouble
some
day
yourself
after
all
as
no
doubt
your
friends
have
told
you
you
played
what
as
a
minister
of
the
crown
i
must
call
a
knave
part
in
attempting
to
save
this
popish
traitor
although
by
god
providence
you
were
frustrated
but
it
is
indeed
going
too
far
to
beg
me
to
assist
you
i
have
never
heard
of
such
audacity
anthony
left
the
house
in
a
fury
it
was
true
as
the
archbishop
had
said
that
sir
francis
walsingham
was
a
convinced
protestant
but
he
had
expected
to
find
in
him
some
indignation
at
the
methods
by
which
the
priest
had
been
captured
and
some
desire
to
make
compensation
for
it
he
went
again
to
the
marshalsea
and
now
heard
that
james
had
been
removed
to
the
tower
with
one
or
two
of
the
catholics
who
had
been
in
trouble
before
this
was
serious
news
for
to
be
transferred
to
the
tower
was
often
but
the
prelude
to
torture
or
death
he
went
on
there
however
and
tried
again
to
gain
admittance
but
it
was
refused
and
the
doorkeeper
would
not
even
consent
to
take
a
message
in
oldham
he
said
was
being
straitly
kept
and
it
would
be
as
much
as
his
place
was
worth
to
admit
any
communication
to
him
without
an
order
from
the
council
when
anthony
got
back
to
lambeth
after
this
fruitless
day
he
found
an
imploring
note
from
isabel
awaiting
him
and
one
of
the
grooms
from
the
hall
to
take
his
answer
back
write
back
at
once
dear
anthony
she
wrote
and
explain
this
terrible
thing
for
i
know
well
that
you
could
not
do
what
has
been
told
us
of
you
but
tell
us
what
has
happened
that
we
may
know
what
to
think
poor
lady
maxwell
is
in
the
distress
you
may
imagine
not
knowing
what
will
come
to
james
she
will
come
to
london
i
think
this
week
write
at
once
now
my
anthony
and
tell
us
all
anthony
scribbled
a
few
lines
saying
how
he
had
been
deceived
and
asking
her
to
explain
the
circumstances
to
lady
maxwell
who
no
doubt
would
communicate
them
to
her
son
as
soon
as
was
possible
he
added
that
he
had
so
far
failed
to
get
a
message
through
the
gaoler
he
gave
the
note
himself
to
the
groom
telling
him
to
deliver
it
straight
into
isabel
hands
and
then
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
reported
to
the
archbishop
what
had
taken
place
i
feared
it
would
be
so
grindal
said
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
commit
your
friend
into
god
hands
and
leave
him
there
my
lord
said
anthony
i
can
not
leave
it
like
that
i
will
go
and
see
my
lord
bishop
and
then
if
he
can
do
nothing
to
help
i
will
even
see
the
queen
grace
herself
grindal
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
dismay
that
will
ruin
all
he
said
an
officer
of
mine
could
do
nothing
but
anger
her
grace
i
must
do
my
best
said
anthony
it
was
through
my
folly
he
is
in
prison
and
i
could
never
rest
if
i
left
one
single
thing
undone
just
as
anthony
was
leaving
the
house
a
servant
in
the
royal
livery
dashed
up
to
the
gate
and
the
porter
ran
out
after
anthony
to
call
him
back
the
man
delivered
to
him
a
letter
which
he
opened
then
and
there
it
was
from
mistress
corbet
what
can
be
done
the
letter
ran
for
poor
james
i
have
heard
a
tale
of
you
from
a
catholic
which
i
know
is
a
black
lie
i
am
sure
that
even
now
you
will
be
doing
all
you
can
to
save
your
friend
i
told
the
man
that
told
me
that
he
lied
and
that
i
knew
you
for
an
honest
gentleman
but
come
dear
anthony
and
we
will
do
what
we
can
between
us
her
grace
noticed
this
morning
that
i
had
been
weeping
i
put
her
off
with
excuses
that
she
knows
to
be
excuses
and
she
is
so
curious
that
she
will
not
rest
till
she
knows
the
cause
come
after
dinner
we
are
at
greenwich
now
and
we
will
see
what
may
be
done
it
may
even
be
needful
for
you
to
see
her
grace
yourself
and
tell
her
the
story
your
loving
friend
mary
corbet
anthony
gave
a
message
to
the
royal
groom
to
tell
mistress
corbet
that
he
would
do
as
she
said
and
then
rode
off
immediately
to
the
city
there
was
another
disappointing
delay
as
the
bishop
was
at
fulham
and
thither
he
rode
directly
through
the
frosty
streets
under
the
keen
morning
sunshine
fretting
at
the
further
delay
he
had
often
had
occasion
to
see
the
bishop
before
and
aylmer
had
taken
something
of
a
liking
to
this
staunch
young
churchman
and
now
as
the
young
man
came
hurrying
across
the
grass
under
the
elms
the
bishop
who
was
walking
in
his
garden
in
his
furs
and
flapped
cap
noticed
his
anxious
eyes
and
troubled
face
and
smiled
at
him
kindly
wondering
what
he
had
come
about
the
two
began
to
walk
up
and
down
together
the
sunshine
was
beginning
to
melt
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
the
birds
were
busy
with
look
at
that
little
fellow
cried
the
bishop
pointing
to
a
thrush
on
the
lawn
he
knows
his
craft
the
thrush
had
just
rapped
several
times
with
his
beak
at
a
worm
earth
and
was
waiting
with
his
head
sideways
watching
aha
cried
the
bishop
again
he
has
him
the
thrush
had
seized
the
worm
who
had
come
up
to
investigate
the
noise
and
was
now
staggering
backwards
bracing
himself
and
tugging
at
the
poor
worm
who
in
a
moment
more
was
dragged
out
and
swallowed
my
lord
said
anthony
i
came
to
ask
your
pity
for
one
who
was
betrayed
by
like
treachery
the
bishop
looked
astonished
and
asked
for
the
story
but
when
he
heard
who
it
was
that
had
been
taken
and
under
what
circumstances
the
kindliness
died
out
of
his
eyes
he
shook
his
head
severely
when
anthony
had
done
it
is
useless
coming
to
me
sir
he
said
you
know
what
i
think
to
be
ordained
beyond
the
seas
and
to
exercise
priestly
functions
in
england
is
now
a
crime
it
is
useless
to
pretend
anything
else
it
is
revolt
against
the
queen
grace
and
the
peace
of
the
realm
and
i
must
confess
i
am
astonished
at
you
norris
thinking
that
anything
ought
to
be
done
to
shield
a
criminal
and
still
more
astonished
that
you
should
think
i
would
aid
you
in
that
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
am
glad
that
the
fellow
is
caught
for
that
i
think
there
will
be
presently
one
less
in
england
i
know
it
is
easy
to
cry
out
against
persecution
and
injustice
that
is
ever
the
shallow
cry
of
the
mob
but
this
is
not
a
religious
persecution
as
you
yourself
very
well
know
it
is
because
the
roman
church
interferes
with
the
peace
of
the
realm
and
the
authority
that
its
ordinances
are
forbidden
we
do
not
seek
to
touch
a
man
private
opinions
however
you
know
all
that
as
well
as
i
anthony
was
raging
now
with
anger
i
am
not
so
sure
my
lord
as
i
was
he
said
i
had
hoped
from
your
lordship
at
any
rate
to
find
sympathy
for
the
base
trick
whereby
my
friend
was
snared
and
i
find
it
now
hard
to
trust
the
judgment
of
any
who
do
not
feel
as
i
do
about
it
that
is
insolence
norris
said
aylmer
stopping
in
his
walk
and
turning
upon
him
his
cold
eyes
and
i
will
not
suffer
it
then
my
lord
i
had
better
begone
to
her
grace
at
once
to
her
grace
exclaimed
the
bishop
said
anthony
and
was
gone
again
as
anthony
came
into
the
courtyard
of
greenwich
palace
an
hour
or
two
later
he
found
it
humming
with
movement
and
noise
cooks
were
going
to
and
fro
with
dishes
as
dinner
was
only
just
ending
servants
in
the
royal
livery
were
dashing
across
with
messages
a
few
great
hounds
for
the
afternoon
baiting
were
in
a
group
near
one
of
the
gateways
snuffing
the
smell
of
cookery
and
howling
hungrily
now
and
again
anthony
stopped
one
of
the
men
and
sent
him
with
a
message
to
mistress
corbet
and
the
servant
presently
returned
saying
that
the
court
was
just
rising
from
dinner
and
mistress
corbet
would
see
him
in
a
parlour
directly
if
the
gentleman
would
kindly
follow
him
a
groom
took
his
horse
off
to
the
stable
and
anthony
himself
followed
the
servant
to
a
little
looking
on
to
a
lawn
with
a
yew
hedge
and
a
dial
he
felt
as
one
moving
in
a
dream
bewildered
by
the
rush
of
interviews
and
oppressed
by
the
awful
burden
that
he
bore
at
his
heart
nothing
any
longer
seemed
strange
and
he
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
what
it
meant
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
trumpets
in
the
court
as
the
queen
left
the
hall
in
five
minutes
more
mistress
corbet
burst
into
the
room
and
her
anxious
look
broke
into
tenderness
at
the
sight
of
the
misery
in
the
lad
face
oh
master
anthony
she
cried
seizing
his
hand
thank
god
you
are
here
and
now
what
is
to
be
done
for
him
they
sat
down
together
in
the
mary
was
dressed
in
an
elaborate
costume
but
her
pretty
lips
were
pale
and
her
eyes
looked
distressed
and
heavy
i
have
hardly
slept
she
said
since
saturday
night
tell
me
all
that
you
know
anthony
told
her
the
whole
story
mechanically
and
miserably
ah
she
said
that
was
how
it
was
i
understand
it
now
and
what
can
we
do
you
know
of
course
that
he
has
been
questioned
in
the
tower
anthony
turned
suddenly
white
and
sick
not
the
not
the
he
began
falteringly
she
nodded
at
him
mutely
with
large
eyes
and
compressed
lips
oh
my
god
said
anthony
and
then
again
o
god
she
took
up
one
of
his
brown
young
hands
and
pressed
it
gently
between
her
white
slender
ones
i
know
she
said
i
know
he
is
a
gallant
gentleman
anthony
stood
up
shaking
and
sat
down
again
the
horror
had
goaded
him
into
clearer
consciousness
ah
what
can
we
do
he
said
brokenly
let
me
see
the
queen
she
will
be
merciful
you
must
trust
to
me
in
this
said
mary
i
know
her
and
i
know
that
to
go
to
her
now
would
be
madness
she
is
in
a
fury
with
pinart
at
something
that
has
passed
about
the
duke
you
know
monsieur
is
here
she
kissed
him
the
other
day
and
the
lord
only
knows
whether
she
will
marry
him
or
not
you
must
wait
a
day
or
two
and
be
ready
when
i
tell
you
but
stammered
anthony
every
hour
we
wait
he
suffers
oh
you
can
not
tell
that
said
mary
they
give
them
a
long
rest
sometimes
and
it
was
only
yesterday
that
he
was
questioned
anthony
sat
silently
staring
out
on
the
fresh
lawn
there
was
still
a
patch
of
frost
under
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
he
noticed
wait
here
a
moment
said
mary
looking
at
him
and
she
got
up
and
went
out
anthony
still
sat
staring
and
thinking
of
the
horror
presently
mary
was
at
his
side
again
with
a
tall
venetian
brimming
with
white
wine
here
she
said
drink
this
and
then
have
you
dined
there
was
not
time
said
anthony
she
frowned
at
him
almost
fiercely
and
you
come
here
fasting
she
said
to
face
the
queen
you
foolish
boy
you
know
nothing
wait
here
she
added
imperiously
and
again
she
left
the
room
anthony
still
stared
out
of
doors
twisting
the
empty
glass
in
his
hand
until
again
came
her
step
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
she
took
the
glass
from
him
and
put
it
down
a
servant
had
followed
her
back
into
the
room
in
a
minute
or
two
with
a
dish
of
meat
and
some
bread
he
set
it
on
the
table
and
went
out
now
said
mary
sit
down
and
eat
before
you
speak
another
word
and
anthony
obeyed
the
servant
presently
returned
with
some
fruit
and
again
left
them
all
the
while
anthony
was
eating
mary
sat
by
him
and
told
him
how
she
had
heard
the
whole
story
from
another
catholic
at
court
and
how
the
queen
had
questioned
her
closely
the
night
before
as
to
what
the
marks
of
tears
meant
on
her
cheeks
it
was
when
i
heard
of
the
racking
explained
mary
i
could
not
help
it
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
cried
and
cried
but
i
would
not
tell
her
grace
that
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
so
i
said
i
had
a
headache
but
i
said
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
prepare
her
for
more
she
has
not
questioned
me
again
she
is
too
full
of
anger
and
of
the
but
she
will
she
will
she
never
forgets
and
then
anthony
it
must
be
you
to
tell
her
you
are
a
young
man
sir
and
she
likes
such
as
that
and
you
must
be
both
forward
and
modest
with
her
she
loves
boldness
but
hates
rudeness
that
is
why
chris
is
so
beloved
by
her
he
is
a
fool
but
he
is
a
handsome
fool
and
a
forward
fool
and
withal
a
tender
fool
and
sighs
and
cries
and
calls
her
his
goddess
and
says
how
he
takes
to
his
bed
when
she
is
not
there
which
of
course
is
true
the
other
day
he
came
to
her
sobbing
like
a
frightened
child
about
the
ring
she
had
given
monsieur
petit
and
oh
she
was
so
tender
with
him
and
so
anthony
you
must
not
be
just
forward
with
her
and
frown
at
her
and
call
her
jezebel
and
tyrant
as
you
would
like
to
do
but
you
must
call
her
cleopatra
and
diana
as
well
forward
and
backward
all
in
one
that
is
the
way
she
loves
to
be
wooed
she
is
a
woman
remember
that
i
must
just
let
my
heart
speak
said
anthony
i
can
not
twist
and
turn
yes
yes
said
mary
that
is
what
i
mean
but
mind
that
it
is
your
heart
they
went
on
talking
a
little
longer
when
suddenly
the
trumpets
pealed
out
again
mary
rose
with
a
look
of
consternation
i
must
fly
she
said
her
grace
will
be
starting
for
the
pit
directly
and
i
must
be
there
do
you
follow
anthony
i
will
speak
to
a
servant
in
the
court
about
you
and
in
a
moment
she
was
gone
when
anthony
had
finished
the
fruit
and
wine
he
felt
considerably
refreshed
and
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
went
out
into
the
court
again
which
he
found
almost
deserted
except
for
a
servant
or
two
one
of
these
came
up
to
him
and
said
respectfully
that
mistress
corbet
had
left
instructions
that
norris
was
to
be
taken
to
the
so
anthony
followed
him
through
the
palace
to
the
back
it
was
a
startlingly
beautiful
sight
that
his
eyes
fell
upon
when
he
came
up
the
wooden
stairs
on
to
the
stage
that
ran
round
the
arena
where
the
sport
was
just
beginning
it
was
an
amphitheatre
perhaps
forty
yards
across
and
the
seats
round
it
were
filled
with
the
most
brilliant
costumes
many
of
which
blazed
with
jewels
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
palisade
were
rich
stuffs
and
tapestries
the
queen
herself
no
doubt
with
alen√ßon
was
seated
somewhere
to
the
right
as
anthony
could
see
by
the
canopy
with
the
arms
of
england
and
france
embroidered
upon
its
front
but
he
was
too
near
to
her
to
be
able
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
her
face
or
figure
the
awning
overhead
was
furled
as
the
day
was
so
fine
and
the
winter
sunshine
poured
down
on
the
dresses
and
jewels
all
the
court
was
there
and
anthony
recognised
many
great
nobles
here
and
there
in
the
specially
reserved
seats
a
ceaseless
clangour
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
filled
the
air
and
drowned
not
only
the
conversation
but
the
terrific
noise
from
the
arena
where
half
a
dozen
great
dogs
furious
with
hunger
and
excited
as
much
by
the
crowds
and
the
brazen
music
overhead
as
by
the
presence
of
their
fierce
adversary
were
baiting
a
huge
bear
chained
to
a
ring
in
the
centre
of
the
sand
anthony
heart
sank
a
little
as
he
noticed
the
ladies
of
the
court
applauding
and
laughing
at
the
abominable
scene
below
no
doubt
in
imitation
of
their
mistress
who
loved
this
fierce
sport
and
as
he
thought
of
the
kind
of
heart
to
which
he
would
have
to
appeal
presently
so
through
the
winter
afternoon
the
bouts
went
on
the
band
answered
with
harsh
chords
the
death
of
the
dogs
one
by
one
and
welcomed
the
collapse
of
the
bear
with
a
strident
bellowing
passage
on
the
great
horns
and
drums
and
by
the
time
it
was
over
and
the
spectators
rose
to
their
feet
anthony
hopes
were
lower
than
ever
can
there
be
any
compassion
left
he
wondered
in
a
woman
to
whom
such
an
afternoon
was
nothing
more
than
a
charming
entertainment
by
the
time
he
was
able
to
get
out
of
his
seat
and
return
to
the
courtyard
the
procession
had
again
disappeared
but
he
was
escorted
by
the
same
servant
to
the
parlour
again
where
mistress
corbet
presently
rustled
in
you
must
stay
she
said
as
late
as
possible
i
wish
you
could
sleep
here
but
we
are
so
crowded
with
these
frenchmen
and
hollanders
that
there
is
not
a
bed
empty
the
queen
is
in
better
humour
and
if
the
play
goes
well
it
may
be
that
a
word
said
even
might
reach
her
heart
i
will
tell
you
when
it
is
over
you
must
be
present
i
will
send
you
supper
here
directly
anthony
inquired
as
to
his
dress
nay
nay
said
mistress
corbet
that
will
do
very
well
it
is
sober
and
quiet
and
a
little
splashed
it
will
appear
that
you
came
in
such
haste
that
you
could
not
change
it
her
grace
likes
to
see
a
man
hot
and
in
a
hurry
sometimes
and
not
always
like
a
peacock
in
the
and
master
anthony
it
suits
you
very
well
he
asked
what
time
the
play
would
be
over
and
that
his
horse
might
be
saddled
ready
for
him
when
he
should
want
it
and
mary
promised
to
see
to
it
he
felt
much
more
himself
as
he
supped
alone
in
the
parlour
the
bewilderment
had
passed
the
courage
and
spirit
of
mary
had
infected
his
own
and
the
stirring
strange
life
of
the
palace
had
distracted
him
from
that
dreadful
brooding
into
which
he
had
at
first
sunk
when
he
had
finished
supper
he
sat
in
the
window
seat
pondering
and
praying
too
that
the
fierce
heart
of
the
queen
might
be
melted
and
that
god
would
give
him
words
to
say
there
was
much
else
too
that
he
thought
over
as
he
sat
and
watched
the
illuminated
windows
round
the
little
lawn
on
which
his
own
looked
and
heard
the
distant
clash
of
music
from
the
hall
where
the
queen
was
supping
in
state
he
thought
of
mary
and
of
her
gay
and
tender
nature
and
of
his
own
boyish
love
for
her
that
indeed
had
gone
or
rather
had
been
transfigured
into
a
brotherly
honour
and
respect
both
she
and
he
he
was
beginning
to
feel
had
a
more
majestic
task
before
them
than
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
the
religion
which
made
this
woman
what
she
was
pure
and
upright
in
a
luxurious
and
treacherous
court
tender
among
hard
hearts
sympathetic
in
the
midst
of
selfish
lives
this
religion
was
beginning
to
draw
this
young
man
with
almost
irresistible
power
mary
herself
was
doing
her
part
bravely
witnessing
in
a
protestant
court
to
the
power
of
the
catholic
faith
in
her
own
life
and
he
what
was
he
doing
these
last
three
days
were
working
miracles
in
him
the
way
he
had
been
received
by
walsingham
and
aylmer
their
apparent
inability
to
see
his
point
of
view
on
this
foul
bit
of
treachery
the
whole
method
of
the
government
of
the
day
and
above
all
the
picture
that
was
floating
now
before
his
eyes
over
the
dark
lawn
of
the
little
cell
in
the
tower
and
the
silent
wrenched
figure
lying
upon
the
straw
the
gallant
gentleman
as
mary
had
called
him
who
had
reckoned
all
this
price
up
before
he
embarked
on
the
life
of
a
priest
and
was
even
now
paying
it
gladly
and
thankfully
no
doubt
all
this
deepened
the
previous
impressions
that
anthony
mind
had
received
and
as
he
sat
here
amid
the
stir
of
the
royal
palace
again
and
again
a
vision
moved
before
him
of
himself
as
a
catholic
and
perhaps
but
isabel
what
of
isabel
and
at
the
thought
of
her
he
rose
and
walked
to
and
fro
presently
the
servant
came
again
to
take
anthony
to
the
presence
chamber
where
the
play
was
to
take
place
i
understand
sir
from
mistress
corbet
said
the
man
closing
the
door
of
the
parlour
a
moment
that
you
are
come
about
maxwell
i
am
a
catholic
too
sir
and
may
i
say
sir
god
bless
and
prosper
you
in
i
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
will
you
follow
me
the
room
was
full
at
the
lower
end
where
anthony
had
to
stand
as
he
was
not
in
court
dress
and
he
could
see
really
nothing
of
the
play
and
hear
very
little
either
the
children
of
paul
were
acting
some
classical
play
which
he
did
not
know
all
he
could
do
was
to
catch
a
glimpse
now
and
again
of
the
protruding
stage
with
the
curtains
at
the
back
and
the
glitter
of
the
armour
that
the
boys
wore
and
hear
the
songs
that
were
accompanied
by
a
little
string
band
and
the
clash
of
the
brass
at
the
more
martial
moments
the
queen
and
the
duke
he
could
see
sat
together
immediately
opposite
the
stage
on
raised
seats
under
a
canopy
a
group
of
halberdiers
guarded
them
and
another
small
company
of
them
was
ranged
at
the
sides
of
the
stage
anthony
could
see
little
more
than
this
and
could
hear
only
isolated
sentences
here
and
there
so
broken
was
the
piece
by
the
talking
and
laughing
around
him
but
he
did
not
like
to
move
as
mistress
corbet
had
told
him
to
be
present
so
he
stood
there
listening
to
the
undertone
talk
about
him
and
watching
the
faces
what
he
did
see
of
the
play
did
not
rouse
him
to
any
great
enthusiasm
his
heart
was
too
heavy
with
his
errand
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
occasional
glimpses
he
caught
of
the
stage
showed
him
a
very
tiresome
hero
dressed
in
velvet
doubled
and
hose
and
steel
cap
strangely
unconvincing
who
spoke
his
lines
pompously
and
was
as
unsatisfactory
as
the
slender
boy
who
representing
a
woman
of
marvellous
beauty
and
allurement
was
supposed
to
fire
the
conqueror
blood
with
passion
at
last
it
ended
and
an
orator
in
apparel
of
cloth
of
gold
spoke
a
kind
of
special
epilogue
in
rhyming
metre
in
praise
of
the
virgin
queen
and
then
retired
bowing
immediately
there
was
a
general
movement
the
brass
instruments
began
to
blare
out
and
an
usher
at
the
door
desired
those
who
were
blocking
the
way
to
step
aside
to
make
way
for
the
queen
procession
which
would
shortly
pass
out
anthony
himself
went
outside
with
one
or
two
more
and
then
stood
aside
waiting
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
hush
and
the
sound
of
a
high
rating
voice
followed
by
a
murmur
of
laughter
in
a
moment
more
the
door
was
flung
open
again
and
to
anthony
surprise
mistress
corbet
came
rustling
out
as
the
people
stepped
back
to
make
room
her
eyes
fell
on
anthony
near
the
door
and
she
beckoned
him
to
follow
and
he
went
down
the
corridor
after
her
followed
her
silently
along
a
passage
or
two
wondering
why
she
did
not
speak
and
then
came
after
her
into
the
same
little
oak
parlour
where
he
had
supped
a
servant
followed
them
immediately
with
lighted
candles
which
he
set
down
and
retired
anthony
looked
at
mistress
corbet
and
saw
all
across
her
pale
cheek
the
fiery
mark
of
the
five
fingers
of
a
hand
and
saw
too
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
that
her
breath
came
unevenly
it
is
no
use
she
said
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
her
grace
is
angry
with
me
and
and
began
anthony
in
amazement
and
she
struck
me
said
mary
struggling
bravely
to
smile
it
was
all
my
fault
and
a
bright
tear
or
two
ran
down
on
to
her
delicate
lace
i
was
sitting
near
her
grace
and
i
could
not
keep
my
mind
off
poor
james
maxwell
and
i
suppose
i
looked
grave
because
when
the
play
was
over
she
beckoned
me
up
and
and
asked
how
i
liked
it
and
why
i
looked
so
solemn
for
she
would
know
was
it
for
or
some
other
man
and
and
i
was
silent
and
alen√ßon
that
little
burst
out
laughing
and
said
to
her
grace
something
something
shameful
in
french
but
i
understood
and
gave
him
a
look
and
her
grace
saw
it
and
and
struck
me
here
before
all
the
court
and
bade
me
begone
oh
it
is
shameful
said
anthony
furiously
his
own
eyes
bright
too
at
the
sight
of
this
gallant
girl
and
her
humiliation
you
can
not
stay
here
mistress
corbet
this
is
the
second
time
at
least
is
it
not
ah
but
i
must
stay
she
said
or
who
will
speak
for
the
catholics
but
now
it
is
useless
to
think
of
seeing
her
grace
yet
maybe
she
will
be
sorry
she
often
is
and
will
want
to
make
amends
and
then
will
be
our
time
so
you
must
be
here
by
at
least
oh
mistress
corbet
said
the
boy
i
wish
i
could
do
something
you
dear
lad
said
mary
and
then
indeed
the
tears
ran
down
anthony
rode
back
to
lambeth
under
the
stars
anxious
and
dispirited
and
all
night
long
dreamed
of
pageants
and
progresses
that
blocked
the
street
down
which
he
must
ride
to
rescue
james
the
brazen
trumpets
rang
out
whenever
he
called
for
help
or
tried
to
explain
his
errand
and
elizabeth
rode
by
bowing
and
smiling
to
all
save
him
the
next
day
he
was
at
greenwich
again
by
and
again
dined
by
himself
in
the
oak
parlour
waited
upon
by
the
catholic
servant
he
was
just
finishing
his
meal
when
in
sailed
mary
beaming
i
told
you
so
she
said
delightedly
the
queen
is
sorry
she
pinched
my
ear
just
now
and
smiled
at
me
and
bade
me
come
to
her
in
her
private
parlour
in
half
an
hour
and
i
shall
put
my
petition
then
so
be
ready
master
anthony
be
ready
and
of
a
good
courage
for
please
god
we
shall
save
him
yet
anthony
looked
at
her
white
and
scared
what
shall
i
say
he
said
speak
from
your
heart
sir
as
you
did
to
me
yesterday
be
bold
yet
not
overbold
tell
her
plainly
that
he
is
your
friend
and
that
it
was
through
your
action
he
was
betrayed
say
that
you
love
the
man
she
likes
say
he
is
a
fine
upstanding
fellow
over
six
feet
in
height
with
a
good
leg
she
likes
a
good
say
that
he
has
not
a
wife
and
will
never
have
one
wives
and
husbands
like
her
not
in
spite
of
petit
and
look
straight
in
her
face
master
anthony
as
you
looked
in
mine
yesterday
when
i
was
a
she
likes
men
to
do
and
then
look
away
as
if
dazzled
by
her
radiancy
she
likes
that
even
more
anthony
looked
so
bewildered
by
these
instructions
that
mary
laughed
in
his
face
here
then
poor
lad
she
said
i
will
tell
you
in
a
word
tell
the
truth
and
be
a
man
a
man
she
likes
that
best
of
all
though
she
likes
sheep
too
such
as
chris
hatton
and
frogs
like
the
duke
and
apes
like
the
little
spaniard
and
chattering
dancing
monkeys
like
the
frenchman
and
and
devils
like
walshingham
but
do
you
be
a
man
and
risk
it
i
know
you
can
manage
that
and
mary
smiled
at
him
so
cheerfully
that
anthony
felt
heartened
there
she
said
now
you
look
like
one
but
you
must
have
some
more
wine
first
i
will
send
it
in
as
i
go
and
now
i
must
go
wait
here
for
the
message
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
kissed
it
and
she
went
out
nodding
and
smiling
over
her
shoulder
anthony
sat
miserably
on
the
ah
so
much
depended
on
him
now
the
queen
was
in
a
good
humour
and
such
a
chance
might
never
occur
again
and
meantime
james
maxwell
waited
in
the
tower
the
minutes
passed
steps
came
and
went
in
the
passage
outside
and
anthony
heart
leaped
into
his
mouth
at
each
sound
once
the
door
opened
and
anthony
sprang
to
his
feet
trembling
but
it
was
only
the
servant
with
the
wine
anthony
took
it
a
fiery
italian
wine
and
drew
a
long
draught
that
sent
his
blood
coursing
through
his
veins
and
set
his
heart
strongly
again
and
even
as
he
set
the
cup
down
the
door
was
open
again
and
a
bowing
page
was
there
may
it
please
you
sir
the
queen
grace
has
sent
me
for
you
anthony
got
up
swallowed
in
his
throat
once
or
twice
and
motioned
to
go
the
boy
went
out
and
anthony
followed
they
went
down
a
corridor
or
two
passing
a
sentry
who
let
the
page
and
the
gentleman
pass
without
challenging
ascended
a
twisted
oak
staircase
went
along
a
gallery
with
stained
glass
of
heraldic
emblems
in
the
windows
and
paused
before
a
door
the
page
before
knocking
turned
and
looked
meaningly
at
anthony
who
stood
with
every
pulse
in
his
body
racing
then
the
boy
knocked
opened
the
door
anthony
entered
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
chapter
x
the
appeal
to
c√¶sar
the
room
was
full
of
sunshine
that
poured
in
through
two
tall
windows
opposite
upon
a
motionless
figure
that
sat
in
a
high
carved
chair
by
the
table
and
watched
the
door
this
figure
dominated
the
whole
room
the
lad
as
he
dropped
on
his
knees
was
conscious
of
eyes
watching
him
from
behind
the
chair
of
tapestried
walls
and
a
lute
that
lay
on
the
table
but
all
those
things
were
but
trifling
accessories
to
that
scarlet
central
figure
with
a
burnished
halo
of
auburn
hair
round
a
shadowed
face
there
was
complete
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
a
hound
bayed
in
the
court
outside
and
there
came
a
bang
of
a
door
somewhere
in
the
palace
there
was
a
rustle
of
silk
that
set
every
nerve
of
his
body
thrilling
and
then
a
clear
hard
penetrating
voice
spoke
two
words
well
sir
anthony
drew
a
breath
and
swallowed
in
his
throat
your
grace
he
said
and
lifted
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
dropped
them
again
but
in
the
glimpse
every
detail
stamped
itself
clear
on
his
imagination
there
she
sat
in
vivid
scarlet
and
cloth
of
gold
radiating
light
with
high
puffed
sleeves
an
immense
ruff
fringed
with
lace
the
narrow
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
and
as
he
now
waited
again
he
knew
that
they
were
running
up
and
down
his
figure
his
dark
splashed
hose
and
his
tumbled
doublet
and
ruff
you
come
strangely
dressed
anthony
drew
a
quick
breath
again
my
heart
is
sick
he
said
there
was
another
slight
movement
well
sir
the
voice
said
again
you
have
not
told
us
why
you
are
here
for
justice
from
my
queen
he
said
and
stopped
and
for
mercy
from
a
woman
he
added
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
again
elizabeth
stirred
in
her
chair
you
taught
him
that
you
wicked
girl
she
said
no
madam
came
mary
voice
from
behind
subdued
and
entreating
it
is
his
heart
that
speaks
enough
sir
said
elizabeth
now
tell
us
plainly
what
you
want
of
us
then
anthony
thought
it
time
to
be
bold
he
made
a
great
effort
and
the
sense
of
constraint
relaxed
a
little
i
have
been
your
grace
to
sir
francis
walsingham
and
my
lord
bishop
of
london
and
i
can
get
neither
justice
nor
mercy
from
either
and
so
i
come
to
your
grace
who
are
their
mistress
to
teach
them
manners
stay
said
elizabeth
that
is
insolence
to
my
ministers
so
my
lord
said
answered
anthony
frankly
looking
into
that
hard
clear
face
that
was
beginning
to
be
lined
with
age
and
he
saw
that
elizabeth
smiled
and
that
the
face
behind
the
chair
nodded
at
him
encouragingly
well
insolence
go
on
it
is
on
behalf
of
one
who
has
been
pronounced
a
felon
and
a
traitor
by
your
grace
laws
that
i
am
pleading
but
one
who
is
a
very
gallant
christian
gentleman
as
well
your
friend
lacks
not
courage
interrupted
elizabeth
to
mary
no
your
grace
said
the
other
that
has
never
been
considered
his
failing
anthony
waited
and
then
the
voice
spoke
again
harshly
go
on
with
the
tale
sir
i
can
not
be
here
all
day
he
is
a
popish
priest
your
majesty
and
he
was
taken
at
mass
in
his
vestments
and
is
now
in
the
tower
and
he
hath
been
questioned
on
the
rack
and
madam
it
is
piteous
to
think
of
it
he
is
but
a
young
man
still
but
passing
strong
and
tall
what
has
this
to
do
with
me
sir
interrupted
the
queen
harshly
i
can
not
pardon
every
proper
young
priest
in
the
kingdom
what
else
is
there
to
be
said
for
him
he
was
taken
through
the
foul
treachery
of
a
spy
who
imposed
upon
me
his
friend
and
caused
me
all
unknowing
to
say
the
very
words
that
brought
him
into
the
net
and
then
more
and
more
anthony
began
to
lose
his
and
poured
out
the
story
from
the
beginning
telling
how
he
had
been
brought
up
in
the
same
village
with
james
maxwell
and
what
a
loyal
gentleman
he
was
and
then
the
story
of
the
trick
by
which
he
had
been
deceived
as
he
spoke
his
whole
appearance
seemed
to
change
instead
of
the
shy
and
rather
clumsy
manner
with
which
he
had
begun
he
was
now
natural
and
free
he
moved
his
hands
in
slight
gestures
his
blue
eyes
looked
the
queen
fairly
in
the
face
he
moved
a
little
forward
on
his
knees
as
he
pleaded
and
he
spoke
with
a
passion
that
astonished
both
mary
and
himself
afterwards
when
he
thought
of
it
in
spite
of
his
short
and
broken
sentences
he
was
conscious
all
the
while
of
an
intense
external
strain
and
pressure
as
if
he
were
pleading
for
his
life
and
the
time
was
short
elizabeth
relaxed
her
rigid
attitude
and
leaned
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
watched
him
her
thin
lips
parted
the
pearl
rope
and
crown
on
her
head
and
the
pearl
pendants
in
her
ears
moving
slightly
as
she
nodded
at
points
in
his
story
ah
your
grace
he
cried
lifting
his
open
hands
towards
her
a
little
you
have
a
woman
heart
all
your
people
say
so
you
can
not
allow
this
man
to
be
so
trapped
to
his
death
treachery
never
helped
a
cause
yet
if
your
men
can
not
catch
these
priests
fairly
then
name
let
them
not
catch
them
at
all
but
to
use
a
friend
and
make
a
judas
of
him
to
make
the
very
lips
that
have
spoken
friendly
speak
traitorously
to
bait
the
trap
like
that
it
is
devilish
let
him
go
let
him
go
madam
one
priest
more
or
less
can
not
overthrow
the
realm
but
one
more
foul
crime
done
in
the
name
of
justice
can
bring
god
wrath
down
on
the
nation
i
hold
that
a
trick
like
that
is
far
worse
than
all
the
disobedience
in
the
world
nay
how
can
we
cry
out
against
the
jesuits
and
the
plotters
if
we
do
worse
ourselves
madam
madam
let
him
go
oh
i
know
i
can
not
speak
as
well
in
this
good
cause
as
some
can
in
a
bad
cause
but
let
the
cause
speak
for
itself
i
can
not
speak
i
know
nay
nay
said
elizabeth
softly
you
wrong
yourself
you
have
an
honest
face
sir
and
that
is
the
best
recommendation
to
me
and
so
minnie
she
went
on
turning
to
mary
this
was
your
petition
was
it
and
this
your
advocate
well
you
have
not
chosen
badly
now
you
speak
yourself
mary
stood
a
moment
silent
and
then
with
a
swift
movement
came
round
the
arm
of
the
queen
chair
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
with
her
hands
upon
the
queen
left
hand
as
it
lay
upon
the
carved
boss
and
her
voice
was
as
anthony
had
never
yet
heard
it
vibrant
and
full
of
tears
oh
madam
madam
this
poor
lad
can
not
speak
as
he
says
and
yet
his
sad
honest
face
as
your
grace
said
is
more
eloquent
than
all
words
and
think
of
the
silence
of
the
little
cell
upstairs
in
the
tower
where
a
gallant
gentleman
lies
all
rent
and
torn
with
the
rack
and
and
how
he
listens
for
the
footsteps
outside
of
the
tormentors
who
come
to
drag
him
down
again
all
aching
and
heavy
with
pain
down
to
that
fierce
engine
in
the
dark
and
think
of
his
gallant
heart
your
grace
how
brave
it
is
and
how
he
will
not
yield
nor
let
one
name
escape
him
ah
not
because
he
loves
not
your
grace
nor
desires
to
serve
you
but
because
he
serves
your
grace
best
by
serving
and
loving
his
god
first
of
and
think
how
he
can
not
help
a
sob
now
and
again
and
whispers
the
name
of
his
saviour
as
the
pulleys
begin
to
wrench
and
and
and
do
not
forget
his
mother
your
grace
down
in
the
country
how
she
sits
and
listens
and
prays
for
her
dear
son
and
can
not
sleep
and
dreams
of
him
when
at
last
she
sleeps
and
wakes
screaming
and
crying
at
the
thought
of
the
boy
she
bore
and
nursed
in
the
hands
of
those
harsh
devils
and
and
you
can
stop
it
all
your
grace
with
one
little
word
and
make
that
heart
bless
your
name
and
pray
for
you
night
and
morning
till
she
dies
and
let
that
gallant
son
go
free
and
save
his
racked
body
before
it
be
torn
asunder
and
you
can
make
this
honest
lad
heart
happy
again
with
the
thought
that
he
has
saved
his
friend
instead
of
slaying
him
look
you
madam
he
has
come
confessing
his
fault
saying
bravely
to
your
grace
that
he
did
try
to
do
his
friend
a
service
in
spite
of
the
laws
for
that
he
held
love
to
be
the
highest
law
ah
how
many
happy
souls
you
can
make
with
a
word
because
you
are
a
what
is
it
to
be
a
queen
to
be
able
to
do
all
that
oh
madam
be
pitiful
then
and
show
mercy
as
one
day
you
hope
to
find
it
mary
spoke
with
an
intense
feeling
her
voice
was
one
long
straining
sob
of
appeal
and
as
she
ended
her
tears
were
beginning
to
rain
down
on
the
hand
she
held
between
her
own
she
lifted
it
to
her
streaming
face
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
and
then
dropped
her
forehead
upon
it
and
so
rested
in
dead
silence
elizabeth
swallowed
in
her
throat
once
or
twice
and
then
spoke
and
her
voice
was
a
little
choked
well
well
you
silly
you
plead
too
well
anthony
irresistibly
threw
his
hands
out
as
he
knelt
oh
god
bless
your
grace
he
said
and
then
gave
a
sob
or
two
himself
there
there
you
are
a
pair
of
children
she
said
for
mary
was
kissing
her
hand
again
and
again
and
you
are
a
pretty
pair
too
she
added
now
now
that
is
enough
stand
up
anthony
rose
to
his
feet
again
and
stood
there
and
mary
went
round
again
behind
the
chair
now
now
you
have
put
me
in
a
sore
strait
said
elizabeth
between
you
i
scarcely
know
how
to
keep
my
word
they
call
me
fickle
enough
already
but
frank
walsingham
shall
do
it
for
me
he
is
certainly
at
the
back
of
it
all
and
he
shall
manage
it
it
shall
be
done
at
once
call
a
page
minnie
mary
corbet
went
to
the
back
of
the
room
into
the
shadow
opened
a
door
that
anthony
had
not
noticed
and
beckoned
sharply
in
a
moment
or
two
a
page
was
bowing
before
elizabeth
is
sir
francis
walsingham
in
the
palace
she
asked
then
bring
him
here
she
ended
as
the
boy
bowed
again
and
you
too
she
went
on
shall
hear
that
i
keep
my
word
she
pointed
towards
the
door
whence
the
page
had
stand
there
she
said
and
leave
the
door
ajar
mary
gave
anthony
her
hand
and
a
radiant
smile
as
they
went
together
aha
said
elizabeth
not
in
my
presence
anthony
flushed
with
fury
in
spite
of
his
joy
they
went
in
through
the
door
and
found
themselves
in
a
tiny
panelled
room
with
a
little
slit
of
a
window
it
was
used
to
place
a
sentry
or
a
page
within
it
there
were
a
couple
of
chairs
and
the
two
sat
down
to
wait
oh
thank
god
whispered
anthony
again
the
harsh
voice
rang
out
from
the
open
door
now
now
no
within
there
mary
smiled
and
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
then
there
came
the
ripple
of
a
lute
from
the
outer
room
played
not
unskilfully
mary
smiled
again
and
nodded
at
anthony
then
a
metallic
voice
but
clear
enough
and
tuneful
began
to
sing
a
verse
of
the
little
of
harrington
comes
my
love
it
suddenly
ceased
in
the
middle
of
the
line
and
the
voice
cried
to
some
one
to
come
in
anthony
could
hear
the
door
open
and
close
again
and
a
movement
or
two
which
doubtless
represented
walsingham
obeisance
then
the
voice
began
again
low
thin
and
distinct
the
two
in
the
inner
room
listened
breathlessly
i
wish
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
to
be
released
sir
francis
without
any
talk
or
and
i
desire
you
to
do
it
for
me
there
was
silence
and
then
walsingham
deep
tones
your
grace
has
but
to
command
his
name
is
james
maxwell
and
he
is
a
popish
priest
a
longer
silence
followed
i
do
not
know
if
your
grace
knows
all
the
circumstances
i
do
sir
or
i
should
not
interfere
the
feeling
of
the
people
was
very
strong
well
and
what
of
that
it
will
be
a
risk
of
your
grace
favour
with
them
have
i
not
said
that
my
name
was
not
to
appear
in
the
matter
and
do
you
think
i
fear
my
people
wrath
there
was
silence
again
well
sir
francis
why
do
you
not
speak
i
have
nothing
to
say
your
grace
then
it
will
be
done
i
do
not
see
at
present
how
it
can
be
done
but
doubtless
there
is
a
way
then
you
will
find
it
sir
immediately
rang
out
the
queen
metallic
tones
mary
turned
and
nodded
solemnly
at
anthony
with
pursed
lips
he
was
questioned
on
the
rack
two
days
ago
your
grace
have
i
not
said
i
know
all
the
circumstances
do
you
wish
me
to
say
it
again
the
queen
was
plainly
getting
angry
i
ask
your
pardon
madam
but
i
only
meant
that
he
could
not
travel
probably
yet
awhile
he
was
on
the
rack
for
four
hours
i
understand
anthony
felt
that
strange
sickness
rise
again
but
mary
laid
her
cool
hand
on
his
and
smiled
at
him
well
well
rasped
out
elizabeth
i
do
not
ask
impossibilities
they
would
cease
to
be
so
madam
if
you
did
mary
within
the
little
room
put
her
lips
to
anthony
ear
butter
she
whispered
well
sir
went
on
the
queen
you
shall
see
that
he
has
a
physician
and
leave
to
travel
as
soon
as
he
will
it
shall
be
done
your
grace
very
well
see
to
it
i
beg
your
grace
pardon
but
what
well
what
is
it
now
i
would
wish
to
know
your
grace
pleasure
as
to
the
future
for
maxwell
is
no
pledge
of
good
behaviour
to
be
exacted
from
him
of
course
he
says
mass
again
at
his
peril
either
he
must
take
the
oath
at
once
or
he
shall
be
allowed
hours
with
his
papers
for
the
continent
your
grace
indeed
i
must
remonstrate
then
the
queen
wrath
burst
out
they
heard
a
swift
movement
and
the
rap
of
her
high
heels
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
by
god
son
she
screamed
am
i
queen
or
not
i
have
had
enough
of
your
counsel
you
presume
sir
her
ringed
hand
came
heavily
down
on
the
table
and
they
heard
the
lute
leap
and
fall
you
presume
on
your
position
sir
i
made
you
and
i
can
unmake
you
and
by
god
i
will
if
i
have
another
word
of
your
counselling
be
gone
and
see
that
it
be
done
i
will
not
bid
twice
there
was
silence
again
and
they
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
close
anthony
heart
was
beating
wildly
he
had
sprung
to
his
feet
in
a
trembling
excitement
as
the
queen
had
sprung
to
hers
the
mere
ring
of
that
furious
royal
voice
even
without
the
sight
of
her
pale
wrathful
face
and
blazing
eyes
that
walsingham
looked
upon
as
he
backed
out
from
the
presence
was
enough
to
make
this
lad
whole
frame
shiver
mary
apparently
was
accustomed
to
this
for
she
looked
up
at
anthony
laughing
silently
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
they
heard
the
queen
silk
draperies
rustle
and
her
pearls
chink
together
as
she
sank
down
again
and
took
up
her
lute
and
struck
the
strings
then
the
metallic
voice
began
again
with
a
little
tremor
in
it
like
the
after
a
storm
and
she
sang
the
verse
through
in
which
she
had
been
interrupted
why
thus
my
love
so
kind
bespeak
sweet
eye
sweet
lip
sweet
blushing
cheek
yet
not
a
heart
to
save
my
pain
o
venus
take
thy
gifts
again
make
not
so
fair
to
cause
our
moan
or
make
a
heart
that
like
your
own
the
lute
rippled
away
into
silence
mary
rose
quietly
to
her
feet
and
nodded
to
anthony
come
back
you
two
cried
the
queen
mary
stepped
straight
through
the
lad
behind
her
well
said
the
queen
turning
to
them
and
showing
her
black
teeth
in
a
smile
have
i
kept
my
word
ah
your
grace
said
mary
curtseying
to
the
ground
you
have
made
some
simple
loving
hearts
very
happy
i
do
not
mean
sir
francis
the
queen
laughed
come
here
child
she
said
holding
out
her
glittering
hand
down
here
and
mary
sank
down
on
the
queen
footstool
and
leaned
against
her
knee
like
a
child
smiling
up
into
her
face
while
elizabeth
put
her
hand
under
her
chin
and
kissed
her
twice
on
the
forehead
there
there
she
said
caressingly
have
i
made
amends
am
i
a
hard
mistress
and
she
threw
her
left
hand
round
the
girl
neck
and
began
to
play
with
the
diamond
pendant
in
her
ear
and
to
stroke
the
smooth
curve
of
her
cheek
with
her
flashing
fingers
anthony
a
little
on
one
side
stood
watching
and
wondering
at
this
silky
tigress
who
raged
so
fiercely
just
now
elizabeth
looked
up
in
a
moment
and
saw
him
why
here
is
the
tall
lad
here
still
she
said
eyeing
us
as
if
we
were
monsters
have
you
never
yet
seen
two
maidens
loving
one
another
that
you
stare
so
with
your
great
eyes
aha
minnie
he
would
like
to
be
sitting
where
i
am
is
it
not
so
sir
i
would
sooner
stand
where
i
am
madam
said
anthony
by
a
sudden
inspiration
and
look
upon
your
grace
why
he
is
a
courtier
already
said
the
queen
you
have
been
giving
him
lessons
minnie
you
sly
girl
a
loyal
heart
makes
the
best
courtier
madam
said
mary
taking
the
queen
hand
delicately
in
her
own
and
next
to
looking
upon
my
grace
norris
said
elizabeth
what
do
you
best
love
listening
to
your
grace
said
anthony
promptly
mary
turned
and
flashed
all
her
teeth
upon
him
in
a
smile
and
her
eyes
danced
in
her
head
elizabeth
laughed
outright
he
is
an
apt
pupil
she
said
to
you
mean
the
lute
sir
she
added
i
mean
your
grace
voice
madam
i
had
forgotten
the
lute
ah
a
little
clumsy
said
the
queen
not
so
true
a
thrust
as
the
others
it
was
not
for
lack
of
said
poor
anthony
blushing
a
little
he
felt
in
a
kind
of
dream
fencing
in
language
with
this
strange
mighty
creature
in
scarlet
and
pearls
who
sat
up
in
her
chair
and
darted
remarks
at
him
as
with
a
rapier
aha
said
the
queen
he
is
blushing
look
minnie
mary
looked
at
him
deliberately
anthony
became
scarlet
at
once
and
tried
a
desperate
escape
it
is
your
livery
madam
he
said
mary
clapped
her
hands
and
glanced
at
the
queen
yes
minnie
he
does
his
mistress
credit
yes
your
grace
but
he
can
do
other
things
besides
talk
explained
mary
anthony
felt
like
a
horse
being
shown
off
by
a
skilful
dealer
but
he
was
more
at
his
ease
too
after
his
blush
extend
your
mercy
madam
he
said
and
bid
mistress
corbet
hold
her
tongue
and
spare
my
shame
silence
sir
said
the
queen
go
on
minnie
what
else
can
he
do
ah
your
grace
he
can
hawk
oh
you
should
see
his
peregrine
named
after
your
majesty
that
shows
his
loyal
heart
i
am
not
sure
of
the
compliment
said
the
queen
hawks
are
fierce
creatures
it
was
not
for
her
fierceness
put
in
anthony
that
i
named
her
after
your
grace
why
then
mr
norris
for
that
she
soars
so
high
above
all
other
creatures
said
the
lad
and
and
that
she
never
stoops
but
to
conquer
mary
gave
a
sudden
triumphant
laugh
and
glanced
up
and
elizabeth
tapped
her
on
the
cheek
sharply
be
still
bad
girl
she
said
you
must
not
prompt
during
the
lesson
and
so
the
talk
went
on
anthony
really
acquitted
himself
with
great
credit
considering
the
extreme
strangeness
of
his
position
but
such
an
intense
weight
had
been
lifted
off
his
mind
by
the
queen
pardon
of
james
maxwell
that
his
nature
was
alight
with
a
kind
of
intoxication
all
his
sharpness
such
as
it
was
rose
to
the
surface
and
mary
too
was
amazed
at
some
of
his
replies
elizabeth
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
she
was
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
she
did
not
do
it
very
well
herself
her
royalty
gave
her
many
advantages
which
she
often
availed
herself
of
and
her
address
was
not
to
be
compared
for
a
moment
with
that
of
some
of
her
courtiers
and
ladies
but
still
she
was
amused
by
this
slender
honest
lad
who
stood
there
before
her
in
his
graceful
splashed
dress
and
blushed
and
laughed
and
parried
and
delivered
his
point
with
force
even
if
not
with
any
extraordinary
skill
but
at
last
she
began
to
show
signs
of
weariness
and
mary
managed
to
convey
to
anthony
that
it
was
time
to
be
off
so
he
began
to
make
his
adieux
well
said
elizabeth
let
us
see
you
at
supper
and
in
the
parlours
ah
she
cried
suddenly
neither
of
you
must
say
a
word
as
to
how
your
friend
was
released
it
must
remain
the
act
of
the
council
my
name
must
not
appear
walsingham
will
see
to
that
and
you
must
see
to
it
too
they
both
promised
sincerely
well
then
lad
said
elizabeth
and
stretched
out
her
hand
and
mary
rose
and
stood
by
her
anthony
came
up
and
knelt
on
the
cushion
and
received
the
slender
scented
ringed
hand
on
his
own
and
kissed
it
ardently
in
his
gratitude
as
he
released
it
it
cuffed
him
gently
on
the
cheek
there
there
said
elizabeth
minnie
has
taught
you
too
much
it
seems
anthony
backed
out
of
the
presence
smiling
and
his
last
glimpse
was
once
more
of
the
great
figure
with
the
slender
waist
and
the
priceless
pearls
and
the
haze
of
muslin
behind
that
crowned
auburn
head
and
the
pale
oval
face
smiling
at
him
with
narrow
eyes
and
all
in
a
glory
of
sunshine
he
did
not
see
mary
corbet
again
until
evening
as
she
was
with
the
queen
all
the
afternoon
anthony
would
have
wished
to
return
to
lambeth
but
it
was
impossible
after
the
command
to
remain
to
supper
so
he
wandered
down
along
the
river
bank
rejoicing
in
the
success
of
his
petition
and
wondering
whether
james
had
heard
of
his
release
yet
of
course
it
was
just
a
fly
in
the
ointment
that
his
own
agency
in
the
matter
could
never
be
known
it
would
have
been
at
least
some
sort
of
compensation
for
his
innocent
share
in
the
whole
matter
of
the
arrest
however
he
was
too
happy
to
feel
the
sting
of
it
he
felt
of
course
greatly
drawn
to
the
queen
for
her
ready
clemency
and
yet
there
was
something
repellent
about
her
too
in
spite
of
it
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
it
was
just
a
caprice
like
her
blows
and
caresses
and
then
the
assumption
of
youth
sat
very
ill
upon
this
lean
woman
he
would
have
preferred
less
and
sprightly
innuendo
and
more
tenderness
and
gravity
mary
had
arranged
that
a
proper
should
be
at
his
disposal
for
supper
and
a
room
to
himself
so
after
he
had
returned
at
sunset
he
changed
his
clothes
the
white
silk
suit
with
the
high
hosen
the
embroidered
doublet
with
great
puffed
and
slashed
sleeves
the
short
cloak
the
white
cap
and
feather
and
the
slender
sword
with
the
jewelled
hilt
all
became
him
very
well
and
he
found
too
that
mary
had
provided
him
with
two
great
emerald
brooches
of
her
own
that
he
pinned
on
one
at
the
fastening
of
the
crisp
ruff
and
the
other
on
his
cap
he
went
to
the
private
chapel
for
the
evening
prayer
at
six
which
was
read
by
one
of
the
chaplains
but
there
were
very
few
persons
present
and
none
of
any
distinction
religion
except
as
a
department
of
politics
was
no
integral
part
of
court
life
the
queen
only
occasionally
attended
on
week
days
and
just
now
she
was
too
busy
with
the
affair
of
the
duke
of
alen√ßon
to
spend
unnecessary
time
in
that
manner
when
the
evening
prayer
was
over
he
followed
the
little
company
into
the
long
gallery
that
led
towards
the
hall
through
which
the
procession
would
pass
to
supper
and
there
he
attached
himself
to
a
group
of
gentlemen
some
of
whom
he
had
met
at
lambeth
while
they
were
talking
the
clang
of
trumpets
suddenly
broke
out
from
the
direction
of
the
queen
apartments
and
all
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
and
remained
there
the
doors
were
flung
open
by
servants
stationed
behind
them
and
the
wands
advanced
leading
the
procession
then
came
the
trumpeters
blowing
mightily
with
a
drum
or
two
beating
the
step
and
then
in
endless
profusion
servants
and
guards
gentlemen
pensioners
magnificently
habited
for
they
were
continually
about
the
person
and
at
last
after
an
official
or
two
bearing
swords
came
the
queen
and
alen√ßon
together
she
in
a
superb
purple
toilet
with
brocaded
underskirt
and
twinkling
shoes
and
breathing
out
essences
as
she
swept
by
smiling
and
he
a
pathetic
little
brown
man
pockmarked
with
an
nose
and
a
head
too
large
for
his
undersized
body
in
a
rich
velvet
suit
sparkling
all
over
with
diamonds
as
they
passed
anthony
he
heard
the
duke
making
some
french
compliment
in
his
croaking
harsh
voice
behind
came
the
crowd
of
ladies
nodding
chattering
rustling
and
anthony
had
a
swift
glance
of
pleasure
from
mistress
corbet
as
she
went
by
talking
at
the
top
of
her
voice
the
company
followed
on
to
the
hall
behind
the
distant
trumpets
and
anthony
found
himself
still
with
his
friends
somewhere
at
the
lower
end
away
from
the
queen
table
who
sat
with
alen√ßon
at
her
side
on
a
da√Øs
with
the
great
folks
about
her
all
through
supper
the
most
astonishing
noise
went
on
everyone
was
talking
loudly
the
servants
ran
to
and
fro
over
the
paved
floor
there
was
the
loud
clatter
over
the
plates
of
four
hundred
persons
and
to
crown
all
a
band
in
the
musicians
gallery
overhead
made
brazen
music
all
anthony
had
enough
entertainment
himself
in
looking
about
the
great
so
magnificently
adorned
with
tapestries
and
armour
and
antlers
from
the
park
and
above
all
by
the
blaze
of
gold
and
silver
plate
both
on
the
tables
and
on
the
sideboards
and
by
watching
the
army
of
liveried
servants
running
to
and
fro
incessantly
and
the
glowing
colours
of
the
dresses
of
the
guests
supper
was
over
at
last
and
a
latin
grace
was
exquisitely
sung
in
four
parts
by
boys
and
men
stationed
in
the
musicians
gallery
and
then
the
queen
procession
went
out
with
the
same
ceremony
as
that
with
which
it
had
entered
anthony
followed
behind
as
he
had
been
bidden
by
the
queen
to
the
private
parlours
afterwards
but
he
presently
found
his
way
barred
by
a
page
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
queen
apartments
it
was
in
vain
that
he
pleaded
his
invitation
it
was
useless
as
the
young
gentleman
had
not
been
informed
of
it
anthony
asked
if
he
might
see
mistress
corbet
no
that
too
was
impossible
she
was
gone
upstairs
with
the
queen
grace
and
might
not
be
disturbed
anthony
in
despair
not
however
unmixed
with
relief
at
escaping
a
further
ordeal
was
about
to
turn
away
leaving
the
officious
young
gentleman
swaggering
on
the
stairs
like
a
peacock
when
down
came
mistress
corbet
herself
sailing
down
in
her
splendour
to
see
what
was
become
of
the
gentleman
of
the
archbishop
house
why
here
you
are
she
cried
from
the
landing
as
she
came
down
and
why
have
you
not
obeyed
the
queen
command
this
young
gentleman
said
anthony
indicating
the
astonished
page
would
not
let
me
proceed
it
is
unusual
mistress
corbet
said
the
boy
for
her
grace
guests
to
come
without
my
having
received
instructions
unless
they
are
great
folk
mistress
corbet
came
down
the
last
six
steps
like
a
stooping
hawk
her
wings
bulged
behind
her
and
she
caught
the
boy
one
clean
light
cuff
on
the
side
of
the
head
you
imp
she
said
daring
to
doubt
the
word
of
this
gentleman
and
the
queen
grace
own
special
guest
the
boy
tried
still
to
stand
on
his
dignity
and
bar
the
way
but
it
was
difficult
to
be
dignified
with
a
ringing
head
and
a
scarlet
ear
stand
aside
said
mary
stamping
her
little
buckled
foot
this
instant
unless
you
would
be
dragged
by
your
red
ear
before
the
grace
come
master
anthony
so
the
two
went
upstairs
together
and
the
lad
called
up
after
them
bitterly
i
beg
your
pardon
mistress
i
did
not
recognise
he
was
your
gallant
you
shall
pay
for
that
hissed
mary
over
the
banisters
they
went
along
a
passage
or
two
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
singing
to
a
virginal
began
to
ring
nearer
as
they
went
followed
by
a
burst
of
applause
lady
leicester
whispered
mary
and
then
she
opened
the
door
and
they
went
in
there
were
three
rooms
opening
on
one
another
with
wide
entrances
so
that
really
one
long
room
was
the
result
they
were
all
three
fairly
full
that
into
which
they
entered
the
first
in
the
row
was
occupied
by
some
and
ladies
talking
and
laughing
some
playing
and
some
of
them
still
applauding
the
song
that
had
just
ended
the
middle
room
was
much
the
same
and
the
third
which
was
a
step
higher
than
the
others
was
that
in
which
was
the
queen
with
lady
leicester
and
a
few
more
lady
leicester
had
just
finished
a
song
and
was
laying
her
virginal
down
there
was
a
great
fire
burning
in
the
middle
room
with
seats
about
it
and
here
mary
corbet
brought
anthony
those
near
him
eyed
him
a
little
but
his
companion
was
sufficient
warrant
of
his
respectability
and
they
soon
got
into
talk
which
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
queen
voice
from
the
next
room
minnie
minnie
if
you
can
spare
a
moment
from
your
lad
come
and
help
us
at
a
dance
the
queen
was
plainly
in
high
and
mary
got
up
and
went
into
the
queen
room
those
round
the
fire
stood
up
and
pushed
the
seats
back
and
the
games
ceased
in
the
third
room
as
her
grace
needed
spectators
and
applause
then
there
arose
the
rippling
of
lutes
from
the
ladies
in
the
next
room
in
slow
swaying
measure
with
the
gentle
tap
of
a
drum
now
and
again
and
the
began
a
stately
dignified
dance
and
among
all
the
ladies
moved
the
great
queen
herself
swaying
and
bending
with
much
grace
and
dignity
it
was
the
strangest
thing
for
anthony
to
find
himself
here
a
raven
among
all
these
peacocks
and
birds
of
paradise
and
he
wondered
at
himself
and
at
the
strange
humour
of
providence
as
he
watched
the
shimmer
of
the
dresses
and
the
sparkle
of
the
shoes
and
jewels
and
the
soft
clouds
of
muslin
and
lace
that
shivered
and
rustled
as
the
ladies
stepped
the
firelight
shone
through
the
wide
doorway
on
this
glowing
movement
and
groups
of
candles
in
sconces
within
the
room
increased
and
steadied
the
soft
intensity
of
the
light
the
soft
tingling
instruments
with
the
slow
marking
the
measure
like
a
step
seemed
a
translation
into
chord
and
melody
of
this
stately
tender
exercise
and
so
this
glorious
loaded
too
with
a
wealth
of
essences
in
the
dresses
and
the
gloves
swayed
under
the
wind
of
the
music
bending
and
rising
together
in
slow
waves
and
ripples
then
it
ceased
and
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
quick
storm
of
applause
while
the
dancers
waited
for
the
lutes
then
all
the
instruments
broke
out
together
in
quick
triple
time
the
stringed
instruments
supplying
a
hasty
throbbing
accompaniment
while
the
shrill
flutes
began
to
whistle
and
the
drums
to
gallop
there
was
yet
a
pause
in
the
dance
till
the
queen
made
the
first
movement
and
then
the
whole
whirled
off
on
the
wings
of
a
it
was
bewildering
to
anthony
who
had
never
even
dreamed
of
such
a
dance
before
he
watched
first
the
lower
line
of
the
shoes
and
the
whole
floor
in
reality
above
and
in
the
mirror
of
the
polished
boards
below
seemed
scintillating
in
lines
of
diamond
light
the
heavy
underskirts
of
brocade
puffed
satin
and
cloth
of
gold
with
glimpses
of
foamy
lace
beneath
whirled
and
tossed
above
these
flashing
vibrations
then
he
looked
at
the
higher
strata
and
there
was
a
tossing
sea
of
faces
and
white
throats
borne
up
as
it
seemed
now
revealed
now
hidden
on
clouds
of
undulating
muslin
and
lace
with
sparkles
of
precious
stones
set
in
ruff
and
wings
and
on
high
piled
hair
he
watched
fascinated
the
faces
as
they
appeared
and
vanished
there
was
every
imaginable
expression
the
serious
looks
of
one
who
took
dancing
as
a
solemn
task
and
marked
her
position
and
considered
her
steps
the
wild
gaiety
of
another
all
white
teeth
and
dimples
and
eyes
intoxicated
by
movement
and
music
and
colour
as
men
are
by
wine
and
guided
and
sustained
by
the
furious
genius
of
the
dance
rather
than
by
intention
of
any
kind
there
was
the
courtly
of
one
tall
beauty
who
danced
as
a
pleasant
duty
and
loved
it
but
never
lost
control
of
her
own
bending
slender
grace
ah
and
there
was
the
oval
face
crowned
with
auburn
hair
and
pearls
the
lower
lip
drawn
up
under
the
black
teeth
with
an
effort
till
it
appeared
to
snarl
and
the
ropes
of
pearls
leaping
wildly
on
her
lean
purple
stomacher
and
over
all
the
grave
oak
walls
and
the
bright
sconces
and
the
taper
flames
blown
about
by
the
eddying
gusts
from
the
whirlpool
beneath
as
anthony
went
down
the
square
winding
staircase
an
hour
later
when
the
evening
was
over
and
the
keen
winter
air
poured
up
to
meet
him
his
brain
was
throbbing
with
the
madness
of
dance
and
music
and
whirling
colour
here
it
seemed
to
him
lay
the
secret
of
life
for
a
few
minutes
his
old
came
back
but
in
more
intoxicating
dress
the
figure
of
mary
corbet
in
her
silk
and
her
clouds
of
black
hair
and
her
jewels
and
her
laughing
eyes
and
scarlet
mouth
and
her
violet
fragrance
and
her
fire
this
dominated
the
boy
as
he
walked
towards
the
stables
across
the
starlit
court
she
seemed
to
move
before
him
to
hold
out
her
hands
to
him
to
call
him
her
own
dear
lad
to
invite
him
out
of
the
life
that
lay
on
all
sides
behind
and
before
up
into
a
mystic
region
of
jewelled
romance
where
she
and
he
would
live
and
be
one
in
the
endless
music
of
rippling
strings
and
shrill
flutes
and
the
maddening
tap
of
a
little
hidden
drum
but
the
familiar
touch
of
his
own
sober
suit
and
the
creaking
saddle
as
he
rode
home
to
lambeth
and
the
icy
wind
that
sang
in
the
river
sedges
and
the
wholesome
smell
of
the
horse
and
the
touch
of
the
coarse
hair
at
the
shoulder
talked
and
breathed
the
old
puritan
common
sense
back
to
him
again
that
melodious
world
he
had
left
was
gaudy
nonsense
and
dancing
was
not
the
same
as
living
and
mary
corbet
was
not
just
a
rainbow
on
the
foam
that
would
die
when
the
sun
went
in
but
both
she
and
he
together
were
human
souls
redeemed
by
the
death
of
the
saviour
with
his
work
to
do
and
no
time
or
energy
for
folly
and
james
maxwell
in
the
tower
thank
god
however
not
for
long
james
maxwell
with
his
wrenched
joints
and
forehead
and
lips
wet
with
agony
was
in
the
right
and
that
lean
bitter
furious
woman
in
the
purple
and
pearls
who
supped
to
the
blare
of
trumpets
and
danced
to
the
ripple
of
lutes
wholly
and
utterly
and
eternally
in
the
wrong
chapter
xi
a
station
of
the
cross
philosophers
tell
us
that
the
value
of
existence
lies
not
in
the
objects
perceived
but
in
the
powers
of
perception
the
tragedy
of
a
child
over
a
broken
doll
is
not
less
poignant
than
the
anguish
of
a
worshipper
over
a
broken
idol
or
of
a
king
over
a
ruined
realm
thus
the
conflict
of
isabel
during
those
past
autumn
and
winter
months
was
no
less
august
than
the
pain
of
the
priest
on
the
rack
or
the
struggle
of
his
innocent
betrayer
to
rescue
him
or
the
misery
of
lady
maxwell
over
the
sorrows
that
came
to
her
in
such
different
ways
through
her
two
sons
isabel
soul
was
tender
above
most
souls
and
the
powers
of
feeling
pain
and
of
sustaining
it
were
also
respectively
both
acute
and
strong
the
sense
of
pressure
or
rather
of
disruption
became
intolerable
she
was
indeed
a
soul
on
the
rack
if
she
had
been
less
conscientious
she
would
have
silenced
the
voice
of
divine
love
that
seemed
to
call
to
her
from
the
catholic
church
if
she
had
been
less
natural
and
feminine
she
would
have
trampled
out
of
her
soul
the
appeal
of
the
human
love
of
hubert
as
it
was
she
was
wrenched
both
ways
now
the
cords
at
one
end
or
the
other
would
relax
a
little
and
the
corresponding
relief
was
almost
a
shock
but
when
she
tried
to
stir
and
taste
the
freedom
of
decision
that
now
seemed
in
her
reach
they
would
tighten
again
with
a
snap
and
she
would
find
herself
back
on
the
torture
to
herself
she
seemed
powerless
it
appeared
to
her
when
she
reflected
on
it
consciously
that
it
was
merely
a
question
as
to
which
part
of
her
soul
would
tear
first
as
to
which
ultimately
retained
her
she
began
to
be
terrified
at
solitude
the
thought
of
the
coming
night
with
its
long
hours
of
questioning
and
torment
until
the
dawn
haunted
her
during
the
day
she
would
read
in
her
room
or
remain
at
her
prayers
in
the
hopes
of
distracting
herself
from
the
struggle
until
sleep
seemed
the
supreme
necessity
then
when
she
lay
down
sleep
would
flap
its
wings
in
mockery
and
flit
away
leaving
her
staring
at
the
darkness
of
the
room
or
of
her
own
eyelids
until
the
windows
began
to
glimmer
and
the
cocks
to
crow
from
farm
buildings
in
spite
of
her
first
resolve
to
fight
the
battle
alone
she
soon
found
herself
obliged
to
tell
mistress
margaret
all
that
was
possible
but
she
felt
that
to
express
her
sheer
need
of
hubert
as
she
thought
it
was
beyond
her
altogether
how
could
a
nun
understand
my
darling
said
the
old
lady
it
would
not
be
calvary
without
the
darkness
and
you
can
not
have
christ
without
calvary
remember
that
the
light
of
the
world
makes
darkness
his
secret
place
and
so
you
see
that
if
you
were
able
to
feel
that
any
human
soul
really
understood
it
would
mean
that
the
darkness
was
over
i
have
suffered
that
night
twice
myself
the
third
time
i
think
will
be
in
the
valley
of
death
isabel
only
half
understood
her
but
it
was
something
to
know
that
others
had
tasted
the
cup
too
and
that
what
was
so
bitter
was
not
necessarily
poisonous
at
another
time
as
the
two
were
walking
together
under
the
pines
one
evening
and
the
girl
had
again
tried
to
show
to
the
nun
the
burning
desolation
of
her
soul
mistress
margaret
had
suddenly
turned
listen
dear
child
she
said
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
over
there
and
she
pointed
out
to
where
the
sunset
glowed
behind
the
tree
trunks
and
the
slope
beyond
over
there
in
west
grinsted
rests
our
dear
lord
in
the
blessed
sacrament
his
body
lies
lonely
neglected
and
forgotten
by
all
but
half
a
dozen
souls
while
twenty
years
ago
all
england
reverenced
it
behold
and
see
if
there
be
any
sorrow
and
then
the
nun
stopped
as
she
saw
isabel
amazed
eyes
staring
at
her
but
it
haunted
the
girl
and
comforted
her
now
and
then
yet
in
the
fierceness
of
her
pain
she
asked
herself
again
and
again
was
it
true
was
it
true
was
she
sacrificing
her
life
for
a
dream
a
or
was
it
true
that
there
the
body
that
had
hung
on
the
cross
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
now
rested
alone
hidden
in
a
silver
pyx
within
locked
doors
for
fear
of
the
oh
dear
lord
was
it
true
hubert
had
kept
his
word
and
left
the
place
almost
immediately
after
his
last
interview
and
was
to
return
at
easter
for
his
final
answer
christmas
had
come
and
gone
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
even
the
tenderest
mysteries
of
the
christian
religion
had
no
touch
with
her
now
she
walked
once
more
in
the
realm
of
grace
as
in
the
realm
of
nature
an
exile
from
its
spirit
all
her
sensitive
powers
seemed
so
absorbed
in
interior
pain
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
to
respond
to
or
appreciate
the
most
keen
external
impressions
as
she
awoke
and
looked
up
on
christmas
morning
early
and
saw
the
frosted
panes
and
the
snow
lying
like
wool
on
the
and
heard
the
christmas
bells
peal
out
in
the
listening
air
as
she
came
downstairs
and
the
old
pleasant
acrid
smell
of
the
evergreens
met
her
and
she
saw
the
red
berries
over
each
picture
and
the
red
heart
of
the
nay
as
she
knelt
at
the
chancel
rails
and
tried
in
her
heart
to
adore
the
rosy
child
in
the
manger
and
received
the
sacred
symbols
of
his
flesh
and
blood
and
entreated
him
to
remember
his
that
brought
him
down
from
heaven
yet
the
whole
was
far
less
real
less
intimate
to
her
than
the
sound
of
hubert
voice
as
he
had
said
two
months
ago
less
real
than
one
of
those
darting
pangs
of
thought
that
fell
on
her
heart
all
day
like
a
shower
of
arrows
and
then
when
the
sensitive
strings
of
her
soul
were
stretched
to
anguish
a
hand
dashed
across
them
striking
a
wailing
discord
and
they
did
not
break
the
news
of
anthony
treachery
and
still
more
his
silence
performed
the
incredible
and
doubled
her
pain
without
breaking
her
heart
on
the
tuesday
morning
early
lady
maxwell
had
sent
her
note
by
a
courier
bidding
him
return
at
once
with
the
answer
the
evening
had
come
and
he
had
not
appeared
the
night
passed
and
the
morning
came
and
it
was
not
till
noon
that
the
man
at
last
arrived
saying
he
had
seen
norris
on
the
previous
evening
and
that
he
had
read
the
note
through
there
and
then
and
had
said
there
was
no
answer
surely
there
could
be
but
one
explanation
of
that
that
no
answer
was
possible
it
could
not
be
said
that
isabel
actively
considered
the
question
and
chose
to
doubt
anthony
rather
than
to
trust
him
she
was
so
nearly
passive
now
with
the
struggle
she
had
gone
through
that
this
blow
came
on
her
with
the
overwhelming
effect
of
an
hypnotic
suggestion
her
will
did
not
really
accept
it
any
more
than
her
intellect
really
weighed
it
but
she
succumbed
to
it
and
did
not
even
write
again
nor
question
the
man
further
had
she
done
this
she
might
perhaps
have
found
out
the
truth
that
the
man
a
stupid
rustic
with
enough
shrewdness
to
lie
but
not
enough
to
lie
cleverly
had
had
his
foolish
head
turned
by
the
buzz
of
london
town
and
the
splendour
of
lambeth
stables
and
the
friendliness
of
the
grooms
there
and
had
got
heavily
drunk
on
leaving
anthony
that
the
answer
which
he
had
put
into
his
hat
had
very
naturally
fallen
out
and
been
lost
and
that
when
at
last
he
returned
to
the
country
already
eight
hours
after
his
time
and
found
the
note
was
missing
he
had
stalwartly
lied
hoping
that
the
note
was
unimportant
and
that
things
would
adjust
themselves
or
be
forgotten
before
a
day
of
reckoning
should
arrive
and
so
isabel
power
of
resistance
collapsed
under
this
last
blow
and
her
soul
lay
still
at
last
almost
too
much
tormented
to
feel
her
last
hope
was
gone
anthony
had
betrayed
his
friend
the
week
crept
by
and
saturday
came
she
went
out
soon
after
dinner
to
see
a
sick
body
or
two
in
an
outlying
hamlet
for
she
had
never
forgotten
dent
charge
and
with
the
present
minister
approval
still
visited
the
sick
one
or
two
days
a
week
at
least
then
towards
sunset
she
came
homewards
over
some
high
ground
on
the
outskirts
of
ashdown
forest
the
snow
that
had
fallen
before
christmas
had
melted
a
week
or
two
ago
and
the
frost
had
broken
up
it
was
a
heavy
leaden
evening
with
an
angry
glow
shining
as
through
chinks
of
a
wall
from
the
west
towards
which
she
was
going
the
village
lay
before
her
in
the
gloom
and
lights
were
beginning
to
glimmer
here
and
there
she
contrasted
in
a
lifeless
way
that
pleasant
group
of
warm
houses
with
their
suggestions
of
love
and
homeliness
with
her
own
desolate
self
she
passed
up
through
the
village
towards
the
hall
whither
she
was
going
to
report
on
the
invalids
to
lady
maxwell
and
in
the
appearance
of
the
houses
on
either
side
she
thought
there
was
an
unaccustomed
air
several
doors
stood
wide
open
with
the
brightness
shining
out
into
the
twilight
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
suddenly
deserted
their
homes
others
were
still
dark
and
cold
although
the
evening
was
drawing
on
there
was
not
a
moving
creature
to
be
seen
she
passed
up
wondering
a
little
through
the
gatehouse
and
turned
into
the
gravel
sweep
and
there
stopped
short
at
the
sight
of
a
great
crowd
of
men
and
women
and
children
assembled
in
dead
silence
some
one
was
standing
at
the
with
his
head
bent
as
if
he
were
talking
to
those
nearest
him
in
a
low
voice
as
she
came
up
there
ran
a
whisper
of
her
name
the
people
drew
back
to
let
her
through
and
she
passed
sick
with
suspense
to
the
man
on
the
steps
whom
she
now
recognised
as
james
his
face
looked
odd
and
drawn
she
thought
what
is
it
she
asked
in
a
sharp
whisper
james
is
here
madam
he
is
with
lady
maxwell
in
the
will
you
please
to
go
up
james
it
is
no
news
about
anthony
or
or
mr
hubert
no
madam
the
man
hesitated
james
has
been
racked
madam
the
man
voice
broke
in
a
great
sob
as
he
ended
ah
she
reeled
against
the
post
a
man
behind
caught
her
and
steadied
her
and
there
was
a
quick
breath
of
pity
from
the
crowd
ah
poor
thing
said
a
woman
voice
behind
her
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
said
the
servant
i
should
not
have
and
and
he
is
upstairs
he
and
my
lady
are
together
madam
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
dazed
with
the
horror
of
it
and
then
going
past
him
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
through
into
the
inner
hall
here
again
she
stopped
suddenly
it
was
half
full
of
people
silent
and
expectant
the
men
the
grooms
the
and
even
two
or
three
she
heard
the
rustle
of
her
name
from
the
white
faces
that
looked
at
her
from
the
gloom
but
none
moved
and
she
crossed
the
hall
alone
and
turned
down
the
lower
corridor
that
led
to
the
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
she
stopped
again
her
heart
drummed
in
her
ears
as
she
listened
intently
with
parted
lips
there
was
a
profound
silence
the
lamp
on
the
stairs
had
not
been
lighted
and
the
terrace
window
only
let
in
a
pale
glimmer
it
was
horrible
to
her
this
secret
presence
of
incarnate
pain
that
brooded
somewhere
in
the
house
this
silence
of
living
anguish
worse
than
death
a
thousand
times
where
was
he
what
would
it
look
like
even
a
scream
somewhere
would
have
relieved
her
and
snapped
the
tension
of
the
listening
stillness
that
lay
on
her
like
a
shocking
nightmare
this
lobby
with
its
doors
the
banister
on
which
her
fingers
rested
the
well
of
the
staircase
up
which
she
stared
with
dilated
eyes
all
was
familiar
and
yet
somewhere
in
the
shadows
overhead
lurked
this
formidable
presence
of
pain
mute
anguished
terrifying
she
longed
to
run
back
to
shriek
for
help
but
she
dared
not
and
stood
panting
she
went
up
a
couple
of
steps
stopped
listened
to
the
sick
thumping
of
her
heart
took
another
step
and
stopped
again
and
so
listening
peering
hesitating
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
ah
there
was
the
door
with
a
line
of
light
beneath
it
it
was
there
that
the
horror
dwelt
she
stared
at
the
thin
bright
line
waited
and
listened
again
for
even
a
moan
or
a
sigh
from
within
but
none
came
then
with
a
great
effort
she
stepped
forward
and
tapped
there
was
no
answer
but
as
she
listened
she
heard
from
within
the
gentle
tinkle
of
some
liquid
running
into
a
bowl
rhythmically
and
with
pauses
then
again
she
tapped
nervously
and
rapidly
and
there
was
a
murmur
from
the
room
she
opened
the
door
softly
pushed
it
and
took
a
step
into
the
room
half
closing
it
behind
her
there
were
two
candles
burning
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
on
the
near
side
of
it
was
a
group
of
three
persons
isabel
had
seen
in
one
of
mistress
margaret
an
engraving
of
an
old
flemish
piet√†
a
group
of
the
blessed
mother
holding
in
her
arms
the
body
of
her
crucified
son
with
the
magdalen
on
one
side
supporting
one
of
the
dead
saviour
hands
isabel
now
caught
her
breath
in
a
sudden
gasp
for
here
was
the
scene
reproduced
before
her
lady
maxwell
was
on
a
low
seat
bending
forwards
the
white
cap
and
ruff
seemed
like
a
veil
thrown
all
about
her
head
and
beneath
her
chin
she
was
holding
in
her
arms
the
body
of
her
son
who
seemed
to
have
fainted
as
he
sat
beside
her
his
head
had
fallen
back
against
her
breast
and
his
pointed
beard
and
dark
hair
and
her
black
dress
beyond
emphasised
the
deathly
whiteness
of
his
face
on
which
the
candlelight
fell
his
mouth
was
open
like
a
dead
man
mistress
margaret
was
kneeling
by
his
left
hand
holding
it
over
a
basin
and
delicately
sponging
it
and
the
whole
air
was
fragrant
and
aromatic
with
some
ointment
in
the
water
a
long
bandage
or
two
lay
on
the
ground
beside
the
basin
the
evening
light
over
the
opposite
roofs
through
the
window
beyond
mingled
with
the
light
of
the
tapers
throwing
a
strange
radiance
over
the
group
the
table
on
which
the
tapers
stood
looked
to
isabel
like
a
stripped
altar
she
stood
by
the
door
her
lips
parted
motionless
looking
with
great
eyes
from
face
to
face
it
was
as
if
the
door
had
given
access
to
another
world
where
the
passion
of
christ
was
being
then
she
sank
on
her
knees
still
watching
there
was
no
sound
but
the
faint
ripple
of
the
water
into
the
basin
and
the
quiet
breathing
of
the
three
lady
maxwell
now
and
then
lifted
a
handkerchief
in
silence
and
passed
it
across
her
son
face
isabel
still
staring
with
great
wide
eyes
began
to
sigh
gently
to
herself
anthony
anthony
anthony
she
whispered
oh
no
no
no
she
whispered
again
under
her
breath
no
anthony
you
could
not
you
could
not
then
from
the
man
there
came
one
or
two
long
sighs
ending
in
a
moan
that
quavered
into
silence
he
stirred
slightly
in
his
mother
arms
and
then
in
a
piteous
high
voice
came
the
words
jesu
esto
mihi
consciousness
was
coming
back
he
fancied
himself
still
on
the
rack
lady
maxwell
said
nothing
but
gathered
him
a
little
closer
and
bent
her
face
lower
over
him
then
again
came
a
long
sobbing
indrawn
breath
james
struggled
for
a
moment
then
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
his
mother
face
mistress
margaret
had
finished
with
the
water
and
was
now
swiftly
manipulating
a
long
strip
of
white
linen
isabel
still
sunk
on
her
knees
watched
the
bandage
winding
in
and
out
round
his
wrist
and
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
then
he
turned
his
head
sharply
towards
her
with
a
gasp
as
if
in
pain
and
his
eyes
fell
on
isabel
mistress
isabel
he
said
and
his
voice
was
broken
and
untuneful
mistress
margaret
turned
and
smiled
at
her
and
at
the
sight
the
intolerable
compression
on
the
girl
heart
relaxed
come
child
she
said
come
and
help
me
with
his
hand
no
no
lie
still
she
added
for
james
was
making
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
james
smiled
at
her
as
she
came
forward
and
she
saw
that
his
face
had
a
strange
look
as
if
after
a
long
illness
you
see
mistress
isabel
he
said
in
the
same
cracked
voice
and
with
an
infinitely
pathetic
courtesy
i
may
not
rise
isabel
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
his
attempt
at
his
old
manner
was
more
touching
than
all
else
and
she
came
and
knelt
beside
the
old
nun
hold
the
fingers
she
said
and
the
familiar
old
voice
brought
the
girl
a
stage
nearer
her
normal
consciousness
again
isabel
took
the
priest
fingers
and
saw
that
they
were
limp
and
swollen
the
sleeve
fell
back
a
little
as
mistress
margaret
manipulated
the
bandage
and
the
girl
saw
that
the
forearm
looked
shapeless
and
discoloured
she
glanced
up
in
swift
terror
at
his
face
but
he
was
looking
at
his
mother
whose
eyes
were
bent
on
his
isabel
looked
quickly
down
again
there
said
mistress
margaret
tying
the
last
knot
it
is
done
james
looked
his
thanks
over
his
shoulder
at
her
as
she
nodded
and
smiled
before
turning
to
leave
the
room
isabel
sat
slowly
down
and
watched
them
this
is
but
a
flying
visit
mistress
isabel
said
james
i
must
leave
again
he
had
sat
up
now
and
settled
himself
in
his
seat
though
his
arm
was
still
round
him
the
voice
and
the
pitiful
attempt
were
terrible
to
isabel
slowly
the
consciousness
was
filtering
into
her
mind
of
what
all
this
implied
what
it
must
have
been
that
had
turned
this
tall
man
into
this
weak
creature
who
lay
in
his
mother
arms
and
fainted
at
a
touch
and
sobbed
she
could
say
nothing
but
could
only
look
and
breathe
and
look
then
it
suddenly
came
to
her
mind
that
lady
maxwell
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
looked
at
her
that
old
wrinkled
face
with
its
white
crown
of
hair
and
lace
had
a
new
and
tremendous
dignity
there
was
no
anxiety
in
it
scarcely
even
grief
but
only
a
still
and
awful
anguish
towering
above
ordinary
griefs
like
a
mountain
above
the
world
and
there
was
the
supreme
peace
too
that
can
only
accompany
a
supreme
emotion
she
seemed
conscious
of
nothing
but
her
son
isabel
could
not
answer
james
and
he
seemed
not
to
expect
it
he
had
turned
back
to
his
mother
again
and
they
were
looking
at
one
another
then
in
a
moment
mistress
margaret
came
back
with
a
glass
that
she
put
to
james
lips
and
he
drank
it
without
a
word
she
stood
looking
at
the
group
an
instant
or
two
and
then
turned
to
isabel
come
downstairs
with
me
my
darling
there
is
nothing
more
that
we
can
do
they
went
out
of
the
room
together
the
mother
and
son
had
not
stirred
again
and
mistress
margaret
slipped
her
arm
quickly
round
the
waist
as
they
went
downstairs
in
the
cloister
beneath
was
a
pleasant
little
oak
parlour
looking
out
on
to
the
garden
and
the
long
south
side
of
the
house
mistress
margaret
took
the
little
that
burned
in
the
cloister
itself
as
they
passed
along
silently
together
and
guided
the
girl
through
into
the
parlour
on
the
side
there
was
a
tall
chair
standing
before
the
hearth
and
as
mistress
margaret
sat
down
drawing
the
girl
with
her
isabel
sank
down
on
the
footstool
at
her
feet
and
hid
her
face
on
the
old
nun
knees
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
mistress
margaret
set
down
the
lamp
on
the
table
beside
her
and
passed
her
hands
caressingly
over
the
girl
hands
and
hair
but
said
nothing
until
isabel
whole
body
heaved
up
convulsively
once
or
twice
before
she
burst
into
a
torrent
of
weeping
my
darling
said
the
old
lady
in
a
quiet
steady
voice
we
should
thank
god
instead
of
grieving
to
think
that
this
house
should
have
given
two
confessors
to
the
church
father
and
son
yes
yes
dear
child
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
of
the
two
dear
lads
we
both
love
well
well
we
do
not
know
we
must
trust
them
both
to
god
it
may
not
be
true
of
anthony
and
even
if
it
be
true
well
he
must
have
thought
he
was
serving
his
queen
and
for
hubert
isabel
lifted
her
face
and
looked
with
a
dreadful
questioning
stare
dear
child
said
the
nun
do
not
look
like
that
nothing
is
so
bad
as
not
trusting
god
anthony
anthony
whispered
the
girl
james
told
us
the
same
story
as
the
gentleman
on
sunday
went
on
the
nun
but
he
said
no
hard
word
and
he
does
not
condemn
i
know
his
heart
he
does
not
know
why
he
is
released
nor
by
whose
order
but
an
order
came
to
let
him
go
and
his
papers
with
it
and
he
must
be
out
of
england
by
monday
morning
so
he
leaves
here
in
the
litter
in
which
he
came
he
is
to
say
mass
if
he
is
able
mass
here
said
the
girl
in
the
same
sharp
whisper
and
her
sobbing
ceased
abruptly
yes
dear
if
he
is
able
to
stand
and
use
his
hands
enough
they
have
settled
it
upstairs
isabel
continued
to
look
up
in
her
face
wildly
ah
said
the
old
nun
again
you
must
not
look
like
that
remember
that
he
thinks
those
wounds
the
most
precious
things
in
the
world
yes
and
his
mother
too
i
must
be
at
mass
said
isabel
god
means
it
now
now
said
mistress
margaret
soothingly
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
i
mean
it
said
isabel
with
sharp
emphasis
god
means
it
mistress
margaret
took
the
girl
face
between
her
hands
and
looked
steadily
down
into
her
wet
eyes
isabel
returned
the
look
as
steadily
yes
yes
she
said
as
god
sees
us
then
she
broke
into
talk
at
first
broken
and
incoherent
in
language
but
definite
and
orderly
in
ideas
and
in
her
interpretations
of
these
last
months
kneeling
beside
her
with
her
hands
clasped
on
the
nun
knee
isabel
told
her
all
her
struggles
disentangling
at
last
in
a
way
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
do
before
all
the
complicated
strands
of
and
guidance
and
blindness
that
had
so
knotted
and
twisted
themselves
into
her
life
the
nun
was
amazed
at
the
spiritual
instinct
of
this
puritan
child
who
ranged
her
motives
so
unerringly
dismissing
this
as
of
self
marking
this
as
of
god
inspiration
accepting
this
and
rejecting
that
element
of
the
circumstances
of
her
life
steering
confidently
between
the
shoals
of
scrupulous
judgment
and
conscience
on
the
one
side
and
the
hidden
rocks
of
presumption
and
despair
on
the
other
these
very
dangers
that
had
baffled
and
perplexed
her
so
long
and
tracing
out
through
them
all
the
clear
deep
safe
channel
of
god
intention
who
had
allowed
her
to
emerge
at
last
from
the
tortuous
and
baffling
intricacies
of
character
and
circumstance
into
the
wide
open
sea
of
his
own
sovereign
will
it
seemed
to
the
nun
as
isabel
talked
as
if
it
needed
just
a
final
touch
of
supreme
tragedy
to
loosen
and
resolve
all
the
complications
and
that
this
had
been
supplied
by
the
vision
upstairs
there
she
had
seen
a
triumphant
trophy
of
another
sorrow
and
conquest
there
was
hardly
an
element
in
her
own
troubles
that
was
not
present
in
that
human
piet√†
upstairs
treachery
loneliness
sympathy
bereavement
and
above
all
the
supreme
sacrificial
act
of
human
love
subordinated
to
divine
human
love
purified
and
transfigured
and
rendered
invincible
and
immortal
by
the
very
immolation
of
it
at
the
feet
of
god
all
this
that
the
son
and
mother
in
their
welcome
of
pain
had
accomplished
in
the
crucifixion
of
one
and
the
of
the
other
this
was
light
opened
to
the
perplexed
tormented
soul
of
the
girl
a
radiance
poured
out
of
the
darkness
of
their
sorrow
and
made
her
way
plain
before
her
face
my
isabel
said
the
old
nun
when
the
girl
had
finished
and
was
hiding
her
face
again
this
is
of
god
glory
to
his
name
i
must
ask
leave
and
then
you
must
sleep
here
for
the
mass
the
chapel
at
maxwell
hall
was
in
the
cloister
wing
but
a
stranger
visiting
the
house
would
never
have
suspected
it
opening
out
of
lady
maxwell
new
was
a
little
lobby
or
landing
about
four
yards
square
lighted
from
above
at
the
further
end
of
it
was
the
door
into
her
bedroom
this
lobby
was
scarcely
more
than
a
broad
passage
and
would
attract
no
attention
from
any
passing
through
it
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
it
was
a
great
tall
old
chest
as
high
as
a
table
that
stood
against
the
inner
wall
beyond
which
was
the
long
gallery
that
looked
down
upon
the
cloister
garden
the
lobby
appeared
to
be
practically
as
broad
as
the
two
rooms
on
either
side
of
it
but
this
was
effected
by
the
outer
wall
being
made
to
bulge
a
little
and
the
inner
wall
being
thinner
than
inside
the
two
the
deception
was
further
increased
by
the
two
being
first
wainscoted
and
then
hung
with
thick
tapestry
while
the
lobby
was
bare
a
curious
person
who
should
look
in
the
chest
would
find
there
only
an
old
dress
and
a
few
pieces
of
stuff
this
lobby
however
was
the
chapel
and
through
the
chest
was
the
entrance
to
one
of
the
priest
hiding
holes
where
also
the
and
the
ornaments
and
the
vestments
were
kept
the
bottom
of
the
chest
was
in
reality
hinged
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
fall
on
the
proper
pressure
being
applied
in
two
places
at
once
sufficiently
to
allow
the
side
of
the
chest
against
the
wall
to
be
pushed
aside
which
in
turn
gave
entrance
to
a
little
space
some
two
yards
long
by
a
yard
wide
and
here
were
kept
all
the
necessaries
for
divine
worship
with
room
besides
for
a
couple
of
men
at
least
to
be
hidden
away
there
was
also
a
way
from
this
hole
on
to
the
roof
but
it
was
a
difficult
and
dangerous
way
and
was
only
to
be
used
in
case
of
extreme
necessity
it
was
in
this
lobby
that
isabel
found
herself
the
next
morning
kneeling
and
waiting
for
mass
she
had
been
awakened
by
mistress
margaret
shortly
before
four
and
told
in
a
whisper
to
dress
herself
in
the
dark
for
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
to
tell
whether
the
house
was
not
watched
and
a
light
seen
from
outside
might
conceivably
cause
trouble
and
disturbance
so
she
had
dressed
herself
and
come
down
from
her
room
along
the
passages
so
familiar
during
the
day
so
sombre
and
suggestive
now
in
the
black
morning
with
but
one
shaded
light
placed
at
the
angles
other
figures
were
stealing
along
too
but
she
could
not
tell
who
they
were
in
the
gloom
then
she
had
come
through
the
little
where
the
scene
of
last
night
had
taken
place
and
into
the
lobby
beyond
but
the
whole
place
was
transformed
over
the
old
chest
now
hung
a
picture
that
usually
was
in
lady
room
of
the
blessed
mother
and
her
holy
child
in
a
great
carved
frame
of
some
black
wood
the
chest
had
become
an
altar
isabel
could
see
the
slight
elevation
in
the
middle
of
the
long
white
linen
cloth
where
the
lay
and
upon
that
again
at
the
left
corner
a
pile
of
linen
and
silk
upon
the
altar
at
the
back
stood
two
slender
silver
candlesticks
with
burning
tapers
in
them
and
a
silver
crucifix
between
them
the
carved
wooden
panels
representing
the
sacrifice
of
isaac
on
the
one
half
and
the
offering
of
melchisedech
on
the
other
served
instead
of
an
embroidered
against
the
side
wall
stood
a
little
folding
table
with
the
cruets
and
other
necessaries
upon
it
there
were
two
or
three
benches
across
the
rest
of
the
lobby
and
at
these
were
kneeling
a
dozen
or
more
persons
motionless
their
faces
downcast
there
was
a
little
wind
such
as
blows
before
the
dawn
moaning
gently
outside
and
within
was
a
slight
draught
that
made
the
taper
flames
lean
over
now
and
then
isabel
took
her
place
beside
mistress
margaret
at
the
front
bench
and
as
she
knelt
forward
she
noticed
a
space
left
beyond
her
for
lady
maxwell
a
moment
later
there
came
slow
and
painful
steps
through
the
and
lady
maxwell
came
in
very
slowly
with
her
son
leaning
on
her
arm
and
on
a
stick
there
was
a
silence
so
profound
that
it
seemed
to
isabel
as
if
all
had
stopped
breathing
she
could
only
hear
the
slow
plunging
pulse
of
her
own
heart
james
took
his
mother
across
the
altar
to
her
place
and
left
her
there
bowing
to
her
and
then
went
up
to
the
altar
to
vest
as
he
reached
it
and
paused
a
servant
slipped
out
and
received
the
stick
from
him
the
priest
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
took
up
the
amice
from
the
vestments
that
lay
folded
on
the
altar
he
was
already
in
his
cassock
isabel
watched
each
movement
with
a
deep
agonising
interest
he
was
so
frail
and
broken
so
bent
in
his
figure
so
slow
and
feeble
in
his
movements
he
made
an
attempt
to
raise
the
amice
but
could
not
and
turned
slightly
and
the
man
from
behind
stepped
up
again
and
lifted
it
for
him
then
he
helped
him
with
each
of
the
vestments
lifted
the
alb
over
his
head
and
tenderly
drew
the
bandaged
hands
through
the
sleeves
knit
the
girdle
round
him
gave
him
the
stole
to
kiss
and
then
placed
it
over
his
neck
and
crossed
the
ends
beneath
the
girdle
and
adjusted
the
amice
then
he
placed
the
maniple
on
his
left
arm
but
so
tenderly
and
lastly
lifted
the
great
red
chasuble
and
dropped
it
over
his
head
and
straightened
it
and
there
stood
the
priest
as
he
had
stood
last
sunday
in
crimson
vestments
again
but
bowed
and
now
then
he
began
the
preparation
with
the
servant
who
knelt
beside
him
in
his
ordinary
livery
as
server
and
isabel
heard
the
murmur
of
the
latin
words
for
the
first
time
then
he
stepped
up
to
the
altar
bent
slowly
and
kissed
it
and
the
mass
began
isabel
had
a
missal
lent
to
her
by
mistress
margaret
but
she
hardly
looked
at
it
so
intent
was
she
on
that
crimson
figure
and
his
strange
movements
and
his
low
broken
voice
it
was
unlike
anything
that
she
had
ever
imagined
worship
to
be
public
worship
to
her
had
meant
hitherto
one
of
two
things
either
sitting
under
a
minister
and
having
the
word
applied
to
her
soul
in
the
sacrament
of
the
pulpit
or
else
the
saying
of
prayers
by
the
minister
aloud
and
distinctly
and
with
expression
so
that
the
intellect
could
follow
the
words
and
assent
with
a
hearty
amen
the
minister
was
a
minister
to
man
of
the
word
of
god
an
interpreter
of
his
gospel
to
man
but
here
was
a
worship
unlike
all
this
in
almost
every
detail
the
priest
was
addressing
god
not
man
therefore
he
did
so
in
a
low
voice
and
in
a
tongue
as
campion
had
said
on
the
scaffold
that
they
both
understood
it
was
comparatively
unimportant
whether
man
followed
it
word
for
word
for
and
here
the
second
radical
difference
lay
the
point
of
the
worship
for
the
people
lay
not
in
an
intellectual
apprehension
of
the
words
but
in
a
voluntary
assent
to
and
participation
in
the
supreme
act
to
which
the
words
were
indeed
necessary
but
subordinate
it
was
the
thing
that
was
done
not
the
words
that
were
said
that
was
mighty
with
god
here
as
these
catholics
round
isabel
at
any
rate
understood
it
and
as
she
too
began
to
perceive
it
too
though
dimly
and
obscurely
was
the
sublime
mystery
of
the
cross
presented
to
god
as
he
looked
down
well
pleased
into
the
silence
and
darkness
of
calvary
and
saw
there
the
act
accomplished
by
which
the
world
was
redeemed
so
here
this
handful
of
disciples
believed
he
looked
down
into
the
silence
and
twilight
of
this
little
lobby
and
saw
that
same
mystery
accomplished
at
the
hands
of
one
who
in
virtue
of
his
participation
in
the
priesthood
of
the
son
of
god
was
empowered
to
pronounce
these
words
by
which
the
body
that
hung
on
calvary
and
the
blood
that
dripped
from
it
there
were
again
spread
before
his
eyes
under
the
forms
of
bread
and
wine
much
of
this
faith
of
course
was
still
dark
to
isabel
but
yet
she
understood
enough
and
when
the
murmur
of
the
priest
died
to
a
throbbing
silence
and
the
worshippers
sank
in
yet
more
profound
adoration
and
then
with
terrible
effort
and
a
quick
gasp
or
two
of
pain
those
wrenched
bandaged
hands
rose
trembling
in
the
air
with
something
that
glimmered
white
between
them
the
puritan
girl
too
drooped
her
head
and
lifted
up
her
heart
and
entreated
the
most
high
and
most
merciful
to
look
down
on
the
mystery
of
redemption
accomplished
on
earth
and
for
the
sake
of
the
to
send
down
his
grace
on
the
catholic
church
to
strengthen
and
save
the
living
to
give
rest
and
peace
to
the
dead
and
especially
to
remember
her
dear
brother
anthony
and
hubert
whom
she
loved
and
mistress
margaret
and
lady
maxwell
and
this
faithful
household
and
the
poor
battered
man
before
her
who
not
only
as
a
priest
was
made
like
to
the
eternal
priest
but
as
a
victim
too
had
hung
upon
a
prostrate
cross
fastened
by
hands
and
feet
thus
bearing
on
his
body
for
all
to
see
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
lady
maxwell
and
mistress
margaret
both
rose
and
stepped
forward
after
the
priest
communion
and
received
from
those
wounded
hands
the
broken
body
of
the
lord
and
then
the
mass
was
presently
over
and
the
server
stepped
forward
again
to
assist
the
priest
to
unvest
himself
lifting
each
vestment
off
for
father
maxwell
was
terribly
exhausted
by
now
and
laying
it
on
the
altar
then
he
helped
him
to
a
little
footstool
in
front
of
him
for
him
to
kneel
and
make
his
thanksgiving
isabel
looked
with
an
odd
wonder
at
the
server
he
was
the
man
that
she
knew
so
well
who
opened
the
door
for
her
and
waited
at
table
but
now
a
strange
dignity
rested
on
him
as
he
moved
confidently
and
reverently
about
the
awful
altar
and
touched
the
vestments
that
even
to
her
puritan
eyes
shone
with
new
sanctity
it
startled
her
to
think
of
the
hidden
catholic
life
of
this
house
of
these
servants
who
loved
and
were
familiar
with
mysteries
that
she
had
been
taught
to
dread
and
distrust
but
before
which
she
too
now
was
to
bow
her
being
in
faith
and
adoration
after
a
minute
or
two
mistress
margaret
touched
isabel
on
the
arm
and
beckoned
to
her
to
come
up
to
the
altar
which
she
began
immediately
to
strip
of
its
ornaments
and
cloth
having
first
lit
another
candle
on
one
of
the
benches
isabel
helped
her
in
this
with
a
trembling
dread
as
all
the
others
except
lady
maxwell
and
her
son
were
now
gone
out
silently
and
presently
the
picture
was
down
and
leaning
against
the
wall
the
ornaments
and
sacred
vessels
packed
away
in
their
box
with
the
vestments
and
linen
in
another
then
together
they
lifted
off
the
heavy
altar
stone
mistress
margaret
next
laid
back
the
lid
of
the
chest
and
put
her
hands
within
and
presently
isabel
saw
the
back
of
the
chest
fall
back
apparently
into
the
wall
mistress
margaret
then
beckoned
to
isabel
to
climb
into
the
chest
and
go
through
she
did
so
without
much
difficulty
and
found
herself
in
the
little
room
behind
there
was
a
stool
or
two
and
some
shelves
against
the
wall
with
a
plate
or
two
upon
them
and
one
or
two
tools
she
received
the
boxes
handed
through
and
followed
mistress
margaret
instructions
as
to
where
to
place
them
and
when
all
was
done
she
slipped
back
again
through
the
chest
into
the
lobby
the
priest
and
his
mother
were
still
in
their
places
motionless
mistress
margaret
closed
the
chest
inside
and
out
beckoned
isabel
into
the
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
then
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
girl
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
my
own
darling
said
the
nun
with
tears
in
her
eyes
god
bless
you
your
first
mass
oh
i
have
prayed
for
this
and
you
know
all
our
secrets
now
now
go
to
your
room
and
to
bed
again
it
is
only
a
little
after
five
you
shall
see
him
james
before
he
goes
god
bless
you
my
dear
she
watched
isabel
down
the
passage
and
then
turned
back
again
to
where
the
other
two
were
still
kneeling
to
make
her
own
thanksgiving
isabel
went
to
her
room
as
one
in
a
dream
she
was
soon
in
bed
again
but
could
not
sleep
the
vision
of
that
strange
worship
she
had
assisted
at
the
pictorial
details
of
it
the
glow
of
the
two
candles
on
the
shoulders
of
the
crimson
chasuble
as
the
priest
bent
to
kiss
the
altar
or
to
adore
the
bowed
head
of
the
server
at
his
side
the
picture
overhead
with
the
mother
and
her
downcast
eyes
and
the
radiant
child
stepping
from
her
knees
to
bless
the
world
all
this
burned
on
the
darkness
with
the
least
effort
of
imagination
too
she
could
recall
the
steady
murmur
of
the
unfamiliar
words
hear
the
rustle
of
the
silken
vestment
the
stirrings
and
breathings
of
the
worshippers
in
the
little
room
then
in
endless
course
the
intellectual
side
of
it
all
began
to
present
itself
she
had
assisted
at
what
the
government
called
a
crime
it
was
for
that
that
collection
of
strange
but
surely
at
least
innocent
things
actions
words
material
objects
that
men
and
women
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
herself
were
ready
to
die
and
for
which
others
equally
of
one
nature
with
herself
were
ready
to
put
them
to
death
it
was
the
mass
the
mass
she
had
seen
she
repeated
the
word
to
herself
so
sinister
so
suggestive
so
mighty
then
she
began
to
think
again
if
indeed
it
is
possible
to
say
that
she
had
ever
ceased
to
think
of
him
of
anthony
who
would
be
so
much
horrified
if
he
knew
of
hubert
who
had
renounced
this
wonderful
worship
and
all
she
feared
for
love
of
her
and
above
all
of
her
father
who
had
regarded
it
with
such
repugnance
yes
thought
isabel
but
he
knows
all
now
then
she
thought
of
mistress
margaret
again
after
all
the
nun
had
a
spiritual
life
which
in
intensity
and
purity
surpassed
any
she
had
ever
experienced
or
even
imagined
and
yet
the
heart
of
it
all
was
the
mass
she
thought
of
the
old
wrinkled
quiet
face
when
she
came
back
to
breakfast
at
the
dower
house
she
had
soon
learnt
to
read
from
that
face
whether
mass
had
been
said
that
morning
or
not
at
the
hall
and
mistress
margaret
was
only
one
of
thousands
to
whom
this
little
set
of
actions
half
seen
and
words
half
heard
wrought
and
said
by
a
man
in
a
curious
dress
were
more
precious
than
all
meditation
and
prayer
put
together
could
the
vast
superstructure
of
prayer
and
effort
and
aspiration
rest
upon
a
piece
of
empty
folly
such
as
children
or
savages
might
invent
then
very
naturally
as
she
began
now
to
get
quieter
and
less
excited
she
passed
on
to
the
spiritual
side
of
it
had
that
indeed
happened
that
mistress
margaret
believed
that
the
very
body
and
blood
of
her
own
dear
saviour
jesus
christ
had
in
virtue
of
his
own
clear
promise
his
own
clear
promise
become
present
there
under
the
hands
of
his
priest
was
it
indeed
this
action
the
most
august
mystery
of
time
the
lamb
eternally
slain
presenting
himself
and
his
death
before
the
throne
in
a
tremendous
and
bloodless
sacrifice
so
august
that
the
very
angels
can
only
worship
it
afar
off
and
can
not
perform
it
or
was
it
all
a
merely
childish
piece
of
blasphemous
mummery
as
she
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
and
then
this
puritan
girl
who
was
beginning
to
taste
the
joys
of
release
from
her
misery
now
that
she
had
taken
this
step
and
united
a
offering
of
herself
to
the
perfect
offering
of
her
lord
now
her
soul
made
its
first
trembling
movement
towards
a
real
external
authority
i
believe
she
rehearsed
to
herself
not
because
my
spiritual
experience
tells
me
that
the
mass
is
true
for
it
does
not
not
because
the
bible
says
so
because
it
is
possible
to
interpret
that
in
more
than
one
way
but
because
that
society
which
i
now
propose
to
treat
as
divine
the
representative
of
the
incarnate
word
nay
his
very
mystical
body
tells
me
so
and
i
rely
upon
that
and
rest
in
her
arms
which
are
the
arms
of
the
everlasting
and
hang
upon
her
lips
through
which
the
infallible
word
speaks
and
so
isabel
in
a
timid
peace
at
last
from
her
first
act
of
catholic
faith
fell
asleep
she
awoke
to
find
the
winter
sun
streaming
into
her
room
and
mistress
margaret
by
her
bedside
dear
child
said
the
old
lady
i
would
not
wake
you
earlier
you
have
had
such
a
short
night
but
james
leaves
in
an
hour
time
and
it
is
just
nine
and
i
know
you
wish
to
see
him
when
she
came
down
half
an
hour
later
she
found
mistress
margaret
waiting
for
her
outside
lady
maxwell
room
he
is
in
there
she
said
i
will
tell
mary
and
she
slipped
in
isabel
outside
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
and
in
a
moment
more
was
beckoned
in
by
the
nun
james
maxwell
was
sitting
back
in
a
great
chair
looking
exhausted
and
white
his
mother
with
something
of
the
same
look
of
supreme
suffering
and
triumph
was
standing
behind
his
chair
she
smiled
gravely
and
sweetly
at
isabel
as
if
to
encourage
her
and
went
out
at
the
further
door
followed
by
her
sister
mistress
isabel
said
the
priest
without
any
introductory
words
in
his
broken
voice
and
motioning
her
to
a
seat
i
can
not
tell
you
what
joy
it
was
to
see
you
at
mass
is
it
too
much
to
hope
that
you
will
seek
admission
presently
to
the
catholic
church
isabel
sat
with
downcast
eyes
his
tone
was
a
little
startling
to
her
it
was
as
courteous
as
ever
but
less
courtly
there
was
just
the
faintest
ring
in
it
in
spite
of
its
weakness
as
of
one
who
spoke
with
authority
i
i
thank
you
james
she
said
i
wish
to
hear
more
at
any
rate
yes
mistress
isabel
and
i
thank
god
for
it
barnes
will
be
the
proper
person
my
mother
will
let
him
know
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
receive
you
by
easter
and
that
you
can
make
your
first
communion
on
that
day
she
bowed
her
head
wondering
a
little
at
his
assurance
you
will
forgive
me
i
know
if
i
seem
discourteous
went
on
the
priest
but
i
trust
you
understand
the
terms
on
which
you
come
you
come
as
a
little
child
to
learn
is
it
not
so
simply
that
she
bowed
her
head
again
then
i
need
not
keep
you
if
you
will
kneel
i
will
give
you
my
blessing
she
knelt
down
at
once
before
him
and
he
blessed
her
lifting
his
wrenched
hand
with
difficulty
and
letting
it
sink
quickly
down
again
by
an
impulse
she
could
not
resist
she
leaned
forward
on
her
knees
and
took
it
gently
into
her
two
soft
hands
and
kissed
it
oh
forgive
him
maxwell
i
am
sure
he
did
not
know
and
then
her
tears
poured
down
my
child
said
his
voice
tenderly
in
any
case
i
not
only
forgive
him
but
i
thank
him
how
could
i
not
he
has
brought
me
from
my
lord
she
kissed
his
hand
again
and
stood
up
her
eyes
were
blinded
with
tears
but
they
were
not
all
for
grief
then
mistress
margaret
came
in
from
the
inner
room
and
led
the
girl
out
and
the
mother
came
in
once
more
to
her
son
for
the
ten
minutes
before
he
was
to
leave
her
chapter
xii
a
strife
of
tongues
anthony
now
settled
down
rather
drearily
to
the
study
of
religious
controversy
the
continual
contrasts
that
seemed
forced
upon
him
by
the
rival
systems
of
england
and
rome
so
far
as
england
might
be
said
to
have
a
coherent
system
at
this
time
all
tended
to
show
him
that
there
were
these
two
schemes
each
claiming
to
represent
christ
institution
and
each
exclusive
of
the
other
was
it
of
institution
that
his
church
should
be
a
department
of
the
national
life
and
that
the
civil
prince
should
be
its
final
arbiter
and
ruler
however
little
he
might
interfere
in
its
ordinary
administration
this
was
elizabeth
idea
or
was
the
church
as
buxton
had
explained
it
a
huge
unnational
society
dependent
it
must
of
course
be
to
some
extent
on
local
circumstances
but
essentially
unrestricted
by
limit
of
nationality
or
of
racial
tendencies
this
was
the
claim
of
rome
of
course
an
immense
number
of
other
arguments
circled
round
this
in
fact
most
of
the
arguments
that
are
familiar
to
controversialists
at
the
present
day
but
the
centre
of
all
to
anthony
mind
as
indeed
it
was
to
the
mind
of
the
civil
and
religious
authorities
of
the
time
was
the
question
of
supremacy
elizabeth
or
gregory
he
read
a
certain
number
of
books
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
followed
with
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
campion
arguments
anthony
was
no
theologian
and
therefore
missed
perhaps
the
deep
subtle
arguments
but
he
had
a
normal
mind
and
was
able
to
appreciate
and
remember
some
salient
points
for
example
he
was
impressed
greatly
by
the
negative
character
of
protestantism
in
such
books
as
nicholl
pilgrimage
in
this
work
a
man
was
held
up
as
a
type
to
be
imitated
whose
whole
religion
to
all
appearances
consisted
of
holding
the
pope
to
be
antichrist
and
his
church
the
synagogue
of
satan
of
disliking
the
doctrines
of
merit
and
of
justification
by
works
of
denying
the
real
presence
and
of
holding
nothing
but
what
could
be
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
by
the
scriptures
then
he
read
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
great
jewell
controversy
this
bishop
of
salisbury
who
had
however
recanted
his
protestant
opinions
under
mary
and
resumed
them
under
elizabeth
had
published
in
his
apology
of
the
church
of
england
a
work
of
vast
research
and
learning
harding
who
had
also
had
the
advantage
of
having
been
on
both
sides
had
answered
it
and
then
the
battle
was
arrayed
it
was
of
course
mostly
above
anthony
head
but
he
gained
from
what
he
was
able
to
read
of
it
a
very
fair
estimate
of
the
conflicting
theses
though
he
probably
could
not
have
stated
them
intelligibly
he
also
made
acquaintance
with
another
writer
against
jewell
rastall
and
with
one
or
two
of
books
the
author
of
synopsis
papismi
and
tretrastylon
papisticum
even
more
than
by
paper
controversy
however
he
was
influenced
by
history
that
was
so
rapidly
forming
before
his
eyes
the
fact
and
the
significance
of
the
supremacy
of
the
queen
in
religion
was
impressed
upon
him
more
vividly
by
her
suspension
of
grindal
than
by
all
the
books
he
ever
read
here
was
the
first
ecclesiastic
of
the
realm
a
devout
humble
and
earnest
man
restrained
from
exercising
his
great
qualities
as
ruler
and
shepherd
of
his
people
by
a
woman
whose
religious
character
certainly
commanded
no
one
respect
even
if
her
moral
life
were
free
from
scandal
and
that
not
because
the
archbishop
had
been
guilty
of
any
crime
or
heresy
or
was
obviously
unfitted
for
his
post
but
because
his
conscientious
judgment
on
a
point
of
church
discipline
and
liberty
differed
from
hers
and
this
state
of
things
was
made
possible
not
by
an
usurpation
of
power
but
by
the
deliberately
ordered
system
of
the
church
of
england
anthony
had
at
least
sufficient
penetration
to
see
that
this
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
religion
however
obscured
it
might
be
by
subsequent
developments
was
yet
fraught
with
dangers
compared
with
which
those
of
papal
interference
were
comparatively
trifling
dangers
that
is
not
so
much
to
earthly
peace
and
prosperity
as
to
the
whole
spiritual
nature
of
the
nation
christianity
yet
another
argument
had
begun
to
suggest
itself
bearing
upon
the
same
point
of
the
relative
advantages
and
dangers
of
nationalism
when
he
had
first
entered
the
archbishop
service
he
had
been
inspired
by
the
thought
that
the
church
would
share
in
the
rising
splendour
of
england
now
he
began
to
wonder
whether
she
could
have
strength
to
resist
the
rising
worldliness
that
was
bound
to
accompany
it
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
men
on
fire
with
success
whether
military
or
commercial
will
be
patient
of
the
restraints
of
religion
if
the
church
is
independent
of
the
nation
she
can
protest
and
denounce
freely
if
she
is
knit
closely
to
the
nation
such
rebuke
is
almost
impossible
a
conversation
that
anthony
had
on
this
subject
at
the
beginning
of
february
helped
somewhat
to
clear
up
this
point
he
was
astonished
after
dinner
one
day
to
hear
that
henry
buxton
was
at
the
porter
lodge
desiring
to
see
him
and
on
going
out
he
found
that
it
was
indeed
his
old
acquaintance
the
prisoner
master
norris
said
the
gentleman
with
his
eyes
twinkling
you
see
the
mouse
has
escaped
and
is
come
to
call
upon
the
cat
anthony
inquired
further
as
to
the
details
of
his
release
well
you
see
said
buxton
they
grew
of
me
i
talked
so
loud
at
them
all
for
one
thing
and
then
you
see
i
was
neither
priest
nor
agent
nor
conspirator
but
only
a
plain
country
gentleman
so
they
took
some
hundred
or
two
pounds
off
me
to
make
me
still
plainer
and
let
me
go
now
norris
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
and
resume
our
conversation
that
was
so
rudely
interrupted
by
my
journey
last
time
but
then
you
see
her
majesty
would
take
no
denial
i
have
just
dined
said
anthony
but
well
i
will
not
ask
you
to
see
me
dine
again
as
you
did
last
time
but
will
you
then
sup
with
me
i
am
at
the
horse
fleet
street
until
anthony
accepted
gladly
for
he
had
been
greatly
taken
with
buxton
and
at
six
that
evening
presented
himself
at
the
running
horse
and
was
shown
up
to
a
private
parlour
he
found
buxton
in
the
highest
he
was
even
now
on
his
way
from
wisbeach
home
again
to
tonbridge
and
was
only
staying
in
london
to
finish
a
little
business
he
had
before
supper
was
over
anthony
had
laid
his
difficulties
before
him
my
dear
friend
said
the
other
and
his
manner
became
at
once
sober
and
tender
i
thank
you
deeply
for
your
confidence
after
being
thought
midway
between
a
knave
and
a
fool
for
over
a
year
it
is
a
comfort
to
be
treated
as
an
honest
gentleman
again
i
hold
very
strongly
with
what
you
say
it
is
that
under
god
that
has
kept
me
steady
as
i
said
to
you
last
time
christ
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
can
you
imagine
for
example
saint
peter
preaching
religious
obedience
to
nero
to
be
a
christian
duty
i
do
not
say
god
forbid
that
her
grace
is
a
nero
or
even
a
popp√¶a
but
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
some
successor
of
hers
should
not
be
however
nero
or
not
the
principle
is
the
same
i
do
not
deny
that
a
national
church
may
be
immensely
powerful
may
convert
thousands
may
number
zealous
and
holy
men
among
her
ministers
and
adherents
but
yet
her
foundation
is
insecure
what
when
the
tempest
of
god
searching
judgments
begins
to
blow
or
to
put
it
plainer
in
a
parable
you
have
seen
i
doubt
not
a
gallant
and
his
mistress
together
so
long
as
she
is
being
wooed
by
him
she
can
command
he
sighs
and
yearns
and
runs
on
errands
in
short
she
rules
him
but
when
they
are
wedded
ah
me
it
is
she
if
he
turns
out
a
brute
that
is
she
that
stands
while
my
lord
plucks
off
his
boots
she
who
runs
to
fetch
the
and
lights
it
and
kneels
by
him
now
i
hold
that
to
wed
the
body
spiritual
to
the
body
civil
is
to
wed
a
delicate
dame
to
a
brute
he
may
dress
her
well
give
her
jewels
clap
her
kindly
on
the
head
but
she
is
under
him
and
no
free
woman
ah
and
then
buxton
eyes
began
to
shine
as
anthony
remembered
they
had
done
before
and
his
voice
to
grow
solemn
and
when
the
spouse
is
the
bride
of
christ
purchased
by
his
death
what
then
would
be
the
sin
to
wed
her
to
a
carnal
nation
who
shall
favour
her
it
may
be
while
she
looks
young
and
fair
but
when
his
mood
changes
or
her
appearance
then
she
is
his
slave
and
his
drudge
his
will
and
his
whims
are
her
laws
as
he
changes
so
must
she
she
has
to
do
his
foul
work
as
she
had
to
do
for
king
henry
as
she
is
doing
it
now
for
queen
bess
and
as
she
will
always
have
to
do
god
help
her
so
long
as
she
is
wedded
to
the
nation
instead
of
being
free
as
the
handmaiden
and
spouse
of
christ
alone
my
faith
would
be
lost
norris
and
my
heart
broken
quite
if
i
were
forced
to
think
the
church
of
england
to
be
the
church
of
christ
they
talked
late
that
evening
in
the
private
parlour
on
the
third
floor
anthony
produced
his
difficulties
one
by
one
and
buxton
did
his
best
to
deal
with
them
for
example
anthony
remarked
on
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
breach
of
succession
as
to
the
edifices
and
endowments
of
the
church
that
the
sees
had
been
canonically
filled
and
even
the
benefices
and
that
therefore
like
it
or
not
the
church
of
england
now
was
identical
with
the
church
said
his
friend
of
course
she
is
the
successor
in
one
sense
what
you
say
is
very
true
it
is
impossible
to
put
your
finger
all
along
the
line
of
separation
it
is
a
serrated
line
the
affairs
of
a
church
and
a
nation
are
so
vast
that
that
is
sure
to
be
so
although
if
you
insist
i
will
point
to
the
supremacy
act
of
and
the
uniformity
act
of
the
same
year
as
very
clear
evidences
of
a
breach
with
the
ancient
order
in
the
former
the
governance
is
shifted
from
its
original
owner
the
vicar
of
christ
and
placed
on
elizabeth
it
was
that
that
the
carthusian
fathers
and
sir
thomas
more
and
many
others
died
sooner
than
allow
and
the
latter
act
sweeps
away
all
the
ancient
forms
of
worship
in
favour
of
a
modern
one
but
i
am
not
careful
to
insist
upon
those
points
if
you
deny
or
disprove
them
though
i
do
not
envy
any
who
attempts
that
yet
even
then
my
principle
remains
that
all
that
to
which
the
church
of
england
has
succeeded
is
the
edifices
and
the
endowments
but
that
her
spirit
is
wholly
new
if
a
highwayman
knocks
me
down
strips
me
clothes
himself
with
my
clothes
and
rides
my
horse
he
is
certainly
my
successor
in
one
sense
yet
he
will
be
rash
if
he
presents
himself
to
my
wife
and
sons
though
i
have
none
by
the
way
as
the
proper
owner
of
my
house
and
name
but
there
is
no
knocking
down
in
the
question
said
anthony
the
bishops
and
clergy
or
the
greater
part
of
them
consented
to
the
change
buxton
smiled
very
well
he
said
yet
the
case
is
not
greatly
different
if
the
gentleman
threatens
me
with
torture
instead
if
i
do
not
voluntarily
give
him
my
clothes
and
my
horse
if
i
were
weak
and
yielded
to
him
yes
and
made
promises
of
all
kinds
in
my
cowardice
yet
he
would
be
no
nearer
being
the
true
successor
of
my
name
and
fortune
and
if
you
read
her
grace
acts
and
king
henry
too
you
will
find
that
that
was
precisely
what
took
place
my
dear
sir
buxton
went
on
if
you
will
pardon
my
saying
it
i
am
astounded
at
the
effrontery
of
your
authorities
who
claim
that
there
was
no
breach
your
puritans
are
wiser
they
at
least
frankly
say
that
the
old
was
that
his
holiness
god
forgive
me
for
saying
it
was
an
usurper
and
that
the
new
genevan
theology
is
the
old
gospel
brought
to
light
again
that
i
can
understand
and
indeed
most
of
your
churchmen
think
so
too
and
that
there
was
a
new
beginning
made
with
protestantism
but
when
her
grace
calls
herself
a
catholic
and
tells
the
poor
frenchmen
that
it
is
the
old
religion
here
still
and
your
bishops
or
one
or
two
of
them
rather
like
cheyney
i
suppose
say
so
too
then
i
am
rendered
dumb
if
that
were
possible
if
it
is
the
same
then
why
name
were
the
altars
dragged
down
and
the
screens
burned
and
the
vestments
and
the
images
and
the
stoups
and
the
pictures
and
the
ornaments
all
swept
out
why
name
was
the
old
mass
blotted
out
and
this
new
brought
in
if
it
be
all
one
and
for
the
last
time
name
why
is
it
death
to
say
mass
now
if
it
be
all
one
go
go
such
talk
is
foolishness
and
worse
buxton
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
anthony
eyed
him
and
then
burst
out
again
ah
but
worse
than
all
are
the
folks
that
stand
with
one
leg
on
either
stool
we
are
the
old
church
say
they
standing
with
the
protestant
leg
in
the
air
therefore
let
us
have
the
money
and
the
buildings
they
are
our
right
and
then
when
a
poor
catholic
says
then
let
us
have
the
old
mass
and
the
old
penance
and
the
old
images
nay
nay
nay
they
say
lifting
up
the
catholic
leg
and
standing
on
the
other
those
are
popery
and
we
are
protestants
we
have
made
away
with
all
such
mummery
and
muniments
of
superstition
and
so
they
go
to
and
fro
when
you
run
at
one
leg
they
rest
them
on
the
other
and
you
know
not
where
to
take
them
and
so
the
talk
went
on
when
the
evening
was
over
and
anthony
was
rising
to
return
to
lambeth
buxton
put
his
hand
on
his
arm
good
norris
he
said
you
have
been
very
patient
with
me
i
have
clacked
this
night
like
an
old
wife
and
you
have
borne
with
me
and
now
i
ask
your
pardon
again
but
i
do
pray
god
that
he
may
show
you
light
and
bring
you
to
the
true
church
for
there
is
no
rest
elsewhere
anthony
thanked
him
for
his
good
wishes
indeed
he
said
too
i
am
grateful
for
all
that
you
have
said
you
have
shown
me
light
i
think
on
some
things
and
i
ask
your
prayers
i
go
to
stanfield
said
buxton
it
is
a
pleasant
house
though
its
master
says
so
not
far
from
sir
philip
sidney
if
you
would
but
come
and
see
me
there
i
am
getting
greatly
perplexed
said
anthony
and
i
think
that
in
good
faith
i
can
not
stay
long
with
the
archbishop
and
if
i
leave
him
how
gladly
will
i
come
to
you
for
a
few
days
but
it
must
not
be
till
then
ah
if
you
would
but
make
the
spiritual
exercises
in
my
house
i
will
provide
a
conductor
and
there
is
nothing
that
would
resolve
your
doubts
so
quickly
anthony
was
interested
in
this
and
asked
further
details
as
to
what
these
were
it
is
too
late
said
buxton
to
tell
you
i
will
write
from
stanfield
buxton
came
downstairs
with
anthony
to
see
him
on
to
his
horse
and
they
parted
with
much
and
anthony
rode
home
with
a
heavy
and
perplexed
heart
to
lambeth
he
spent
a
few
days
more
pondering
and
then
determined
to
lay
his
difficulties
before
the
archbishop
and
resign
his
position
if
grindal
thought
it
well
he
asked
for
an
interview
and
the
archbishop
appointed
an
hour
in
the
afternoon
at
which
he
would
see
him
in
cranmer
parlour
the
room
above
the
vestry
which
formed
part
of
the
tower
that
archbishop
cranmer
had
added
to
lambeth
house
anthony
walking
up
and
down
in
the
little
tiled
cloisters
by
the
creek
a
few
minutes
before
the
hour
fixed
heard
rolling
out
of
the
chapel
windows
and
went
in
to
see
who
was
playing
he
came
in
through
the
vestry
and
looking
to
the
west
end
gallery
saw
there
the
back
of
old
tallis
seated
at
the
little
positive
organ
that
the
late
archbishop
had
left
in
his
chapel
and
which
the
present
archbishop
had
gladly
retained
for
he
was
a
great
patron
of
music
and
befriended
many
musicians
when
they
needed
help
tallis
as
well
as
byrd
morley
and
tye
there
were
a
few
persons
in
the
chapel
listening
the
reverend
wilson
one
of
the
chaplains
being
among
them
and
anthony
thought
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
sit
here
a
little
and
quiet
his
thoughts
which
were
nervous
and
distracted
at
the
prospect
of
his
coming
interview
he
heard
voices
from
overhead
which
showed
that
the
archbishop
was
engaged
so
he
spoke
to
an
usher
stationed
in
the
vestry
telling
him
that
he
was
ready
as
soon
as
the
archbishop
could
receive
him
and
that
he
would
wait
in
the
chapel
and
then
made
his
way
down
to
one
of
the
return
stalls
at
the
west
end
against
the
screen
and
took
his
seat
there
this
february
afternoon
was
growing
dark
and
the
only
lights
in
the
chapel
were
those
in
the
organ
loft
but
there
was
still
enough
daylight
outside
to
make
the
windows
visible
those
famous
windows
of
morton
which
like
those
in
king
chapel
cambridge
combined
and
interpreted
the
old
and
new
testaments
by
an
ingenious
system
of
types
and
antitypes
in
the
manner
of
the
biblia
pauperum
there
was
then
only
a
single
subject
in
each
light
and
anthony
let
his
eyes
wander
musingly
to
and
fro
in
the
east
window
from
the
central
figure
of
the
crucified
to
the
types
on
either
side
especially
to
a
touching
group
of
the
unconscious
isaac
carrying
the
wood
for
his
own
death
as
christ
his
cross
beneath
instead
of
the
old
stately
altar
glowing
with
stuffs
and
precious
metals
and
jewels
which
had
once
been
the
heart
of
this
beautiful
shrine
there
stood
now
a
plain
solid
wooden
table
that
the
archbishop
used
for
the
communion
anthony
looked
at
it
and
sighed
a
little
to
himself
did
the
altar
and
the
table
then
mean
the
same
thing
meanwhile
the
glorious
music
was
rolling
overhead
in
the
high
vaulted
roof
the
old
man
was
extemporising
but
his
manner
was
evident
even
in
that
there
was
a
simple
solemn
phrase
that
formed
his
theme
and
round
this
adorning
and
enriching
it
moved
the
grave
chords
on
and
on
travelled
the
melody
like
the
flow
of
a
broad
river
now
sliding
steadily
through
a
smiling
land
of
simple
harmonies
where
dwelt
a
people
of
plain
tastes
and
solid
virtues
now
passing
over
shallows
where
the
sun
glanced
and
played
in
the
brown
water
among
the
stones
as
light
arpeggio
chords
rippled
up
and
vanished
round
about
the
melody
now
entering
a
land
of
mighty
stones
and
caverns
where
the
echoes
rang
hollow
and
resonant
as
the
counterpoint
began
to
rumble
and
trip
like
boulders
far
down
out
of
sight
in
subaqueous
gloom
now
rolling
out
again
and
widening
fuller
and
deeper
as
it
went
moving
in
great
masses
towards
the
edge
of
the
cataract
that
lies
like
a
line
across
the
landscape
it
is
inevitable
now
the
crash
must
come
a
chord
or
two
pausing
pausing
and
then
the
crash
stupendous
and
sonorous
then
on
again
through
elaborate
cities
where
the
wits
and
courtiers
dwell
and
stately
palaces
slide
past
upon
the
banks
and
barges
move
upon
its
breast
on
to
the
sea
that
final
full
close
that
embraces
and
engulfs
all
music
all
effort
all
doubts
and
questionings
whether
in
art
or
theology
all
life
of
intellect
heart
or
will
that
fathomless
eternal
deep
from
which
all
comes
and
to
which
all
returns
that
men
call
the
love
of
god
anthony
stirred
in
his
seat
he
had
been
here
ten
minutes
proposing
to
take
his
restless
thoughts
in
hand
and
quiet
them
and
lo
it
had
been
done
for
him
by
the
master
who
sat
overhead
here
he
for
the
moment
remained
ready
for
anything
glad
to
take
up
the
wood
and
bear
it
to
the
mount
of
sacrifice
content
to
be
carried
on
in
that
river
of
god
will
to
the
repose
of
god
heart
content
to
dwell
meantime
in
the
echoing
caverns
of
doubt
in
the
glancing
shadows
and
lights
of
an
active
life
in
his
own
simple
sunlit
life
in
the
country
or
even
to
plunge
over
the
cataract
down
into
the
fierce
tormented
pools
in
the
dark
for
after
all
the
sea
lay
beyond
and
he
who
commits
himself
to
the
river
is
bound
to
reach
it
he
heard
a
step
and
the
usher
stood
by
him
his
grace
is
ready
master
norris
anthony
rose
and
followed
him
the
archbishop
received
him
with
the
greatest
kindness
as
anthony
came
in
he
half
rose
peering
with
his
eyes
and
smiling
and
holding
out
his
hands
come
master
norris
he
said
you
are
always
welcome
sit
down
and
he
placed
him
in
a
chair
at
the
table
close
by
his
own
now
what
is
it
he
said
kindly
for
the
old
man
heart
was
a
little
anxious
at
this
formal
interview
that
had
been
requested
by
this
favourite
young
officer
of
his
then
anthony
without
any
reserve
told
him
all
tracing
out
the
long
tale
of
doubt
by
landmarks
that
he
remembered
mentioning
the
effect
produced
on
his
mind
by
the
queen
suspension
of
the
archbishop
especially
dwelling
on
the
arrest
the
examination
and
the
death
of
campion
that
had
made
such
a
profound
impression
upon
him
upon
his
own
reading
and
trains
of
thought
and
the
conversations
with
buxton
though
of
course
he
did
not
mention
his
name
he
ended
by
saying
that
he
had
little
doubt
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
compelled
to
leave
the
communion
of
the
church
of
england
for
that
of
rome
and
by
placing
his
resignation
in
the
archbishop
hands
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
for
the
unceasing
kindness
and
consideration
that
he
had
always
received
at
his
hands
there
was
silence
when
he
had
finished
a
sliding
panel
in
the
wall
near
the
chapel
had
been
pushed
back
and
the
mellow
music
of
tallis
pealed
softly
in
giving
a
sweet
and
melodious
background
scarcely
perceived
consciously
by
either
of
them
and
yet
probably
mellowing
and
softening
their
modes
of
expression
during
the
whole
of
the
interview
norris
said
the
archbishop
at
last
i
first
thank
you
for
the
generous
confidence
you
have
shown
towards
me
and
i
shall
put
myself
under
a
further
obligation
to
you
by
accepting
your
resignation
and
this
i
do
for
both
our
sakes
for
yours
because
as
you
confess
this
action
of
the
queen
i
neither
condemn
nor
excuse
it
myself
this
action
has
influenced
your
thoughts
therefore
you
had
best
be
removed
from
it
to
a
place
where
you
can
judge
more
quietly
and
i
accept
it
for
my
own
sake
too
for
several
reasons
that
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
but
in
doing
this
i
desire
you
norris
to
continue
to
draw
your
salary
until
midsummer
nay
nay
you
must
let
me
have
my
say
you
are
at
liberty
to
withdraw
as
soon
as
you
have
wound
up
your
arrangements
with
somerdine
he
will
now
as
yeoman
of
the
horse
have
your
duties
as
well
as
his
own
for
i
do
not
intend
to
have
another
gentleman
of
the
horse
as
regards
an
increase
of
salary
for
him
that
can
wait
until
i
see
him
myself
in
any
case
norris
i
think
you
had
better
withdraw
before
sunday
and
now
for
your
trouble
i
know
very
well
that
i
can
not
be
of
much
service
to
you
i
am
no
controversialist
but
i
must
bear
my
witness
this
papist
with
whom
you
have
had
talk
seems
a
very
plausible
fellow
his
arguments
sound
very
plain
and
good
and
yet
i
think
you
could
prove
anything
by
them
they
seem
to
me
like
that
openwork
embroidery
such
as
you
see
on
communion
linen
sometimes
in
which
the
pattern
is
formed
by
withdrawing
certain
threads
he
has
cleverly
omitted
just
those
points
that
would
ruin
his
argument
and
he
has
made
a
pretty
design
but
any
skilful
advocate
could
make
any
other
design
by
the
same
methods
he
has
not
thought
fit
to
deal
with
such
words
of
our
saviour
as
what
he
says
on
tradition
with
what
the
scriptures
say
against
the
worshipping
of
angels
with
what
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
colossians
in
the
second
chapter
concerning
all
those
carnal
ordinances
which
were
done
away
by
christ
but
which
have
been
restored
by
the
pope
in
his
despite
he
does
not
deal
with
those
terrible
words
concerning
the
man
of
sin
and
the
mystery
of
iniquity
in
fact
he
takes
just
one
word
that
christ
let
fall
about
his
kingdom
and
builds
this
great
edifice
upon
it
you
might
retort
to
him
in
a
thousand
ways
such
as
these
bishop
jewell
in
his
book
as
you
know
deals
with
these
questions
and
many
more
far
more
fully
than
it
is
possible
for
you
and
me
even
to
dream
of
doing
nay
norris
the
only
argument
i
can
lay
before
you
is
this
there
are
difficulties
and
troubles
everywhere
that
there
are
such
in
the
church
of
england
who
would
care
to
deny
that
there
are
equally
such
aye
and
far
more
in
the
church
of
rome
who
would
care
to
deny
either
meanwhile
the
providence
of
god
has
set
you
here
and
not
there
whatever
your
difficulties
are
here
are
not
of
your
choosing
but
if
you
fly
there
and
i
pray
god
you
will
not
there
they
will
be
be
content
master
norris
indeed
you
have
a
goodly
heritage
be
content
with
it
lest
losing
that
you
lose
all
anthony
was
greatly
touched
by
this
moderate
and
courteous
line
that
the
archbishop
was
taking
he
knew
well
in
his
heart
that
the
church
of
rome
was
in
the
eyes
of
this
old
man
a
false
and
deceitful
body
for
whom
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
said
grindal
in
his
travels
abroad
during
the
marian
troubles
had
been
deeply
attracted
by
the
genevan
theology
with
whose
professors
he
had
never
wholly
lost
touch
and
anthony
guessed
what
an
effort
it
was
costing
him
and
what
a
strain
it
was
on
his
conscience
thus
to
combine
courtesy
with
faithfulness
to
what
he
believed
to
be
true
grindal
apparently
feared
he
had
sacrificed
his
convictions
for
he
presently
added
you
know
norris
that
i
think
very
much
worse
of
papistry
than
i
have
expressed
but
i
have
refrained
because
i
think
that
would
not
help
you
and
i
desire
to
do
that
more
than
to
relieve
myself
anthony
thanked
him
for
his
gentleness
saying
that
he
quite
understood
his
motives
in
speaking
as
he
had
done
and
was
deeply
obliged
to
him
for
it
the
archbishop
however
as
indeed
were
most
of
the
english
divines
of
the
time
was
far
more
deeply
versed
in
destructive
than
constructive
theology
and
to
anthony
regret
was
presently
beginning
in
that
direction
it
is
beyond
my
imagination
norris
he
said
that
any
who
have
known
the
simple
gospel
should
return
to
the
darkness
see
here
he
went
on
rising
and
fumbling
among
his
books
i
have
somewhere
here
what
they
call
an
indulgence
he
searched
for
a
few
minutes
and
presently
shook
out
of
the
leaves
of
jewell
book
a
paper
which
he
peered
at
and
then
pushed
over
to
anthony
it
was
a
little
rectangular
paper
some
four
or
five
inches
long
bearing
a
figure
of
christ
wounded
with
his
hands
bound
together
before
him
and
the
cross
with
the
superscription
rising
behind
in
compartments
on
either
side
were
instruments
of
the
passion
the
spear
and
the
reed
with
the
sponge
with
other
figures
and
emblems
anthony
spelt
out
the
inscription
read
it
aloud
norris
said
the
archbishop
them
read
anthony
before
this
image
of
pity
devoutly
say
five
paternosters
five
aves
and
a
credo
piteously
beholding
these
arms
of
christ
passion
are
granted
thousand
seven
hundred
and
years
of
pardon
now
norris
said
the
archbishop
have
you
considered
that
it
is
to
that
kind
of
religion
that
you
are
attracted
i
will
not
comment
on
it
there
is
no
need
your
grace
said
anthony
slowly
laying
the
paper
down
i
need
not
say
i
think
that
this
kind
of
thing
is
deeply
distasteful
to
me
too
your
grace
can
not
dislike
it
more
than
i
do
but
then
i
do
not
understand
it
i
do
not
know
what
indulgences
mean
i
only
know
that
were
they
as
mad
and
foolish
as
we
protestants
think
them
no
truthful
or
good
man
could
remain
a
papist
for
a
day
but
then
there
are
many
thoughtful
and
good
men
papists
and
i
conclude
from
that
that
what
we
think
the
indulgences
to
be
can
not
be
what
they
really
are
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
and
again
my
lord
may
i
add
this
if
i
were
a
turk
i
should
find
many
things
in
the
christian
religion
quite
as
repellent
to
me
for
example
how
can
it
be
just
i
should
ask
that
the
death
of
an
innocent
man
such
as
christ
was
should
be
my
salvation
how
again
is
it
just
that
faith
should
save
surely
one
who
has
sinned
greatly
ought
to
do
something
towards
his
forgiveness
and
not
merely
trust
to
another
but
you
my
lord
would
tell
me
that
there
are
explanations
of
these
difficulties
and
of
many
more
too
of
which
i
should
gradually
understand
more
and
more
after
i
was
a
christian
or
again
it
appears
to
me
even
now
christian
as
i
am
judging
as
a
plain
man
that
predestination
contradicts
and
no
explanation
can
make
them
both
reasonable
yet
by
the
grace
of
god
i
believe
all
these
doctrines
and
many
more
not
because
i
understand
them
for
i
do
not
but
because
i
believe
that
they
are
part
of
the
revelation
of
god
it
is
just
so
too
with
the
roman
catholic
church
i
must
not
take
this
or
that
doctrine
by
itself
but
i
must
make
up
my
mind
whether
or
no
it
is
the
one
only
catholic
church
and
then
i
shall
believe
all
that
she
teaches
because
she
teaches
it
and
not
because
i
understand
it
you
must
forgive
my
dulness
my
lord
but
i
am
but
a
layman
and
can
only
say
what
i
think
in
simple
words
but
we
must
judge
of
a
christian
body
by
what
that
body
teaches
said
the
archbishop
on
what
other
grounds
are
you
drawn
to
the
papists
except
by
what
they
teach
yes
your
grace
said
anthony
i
do
judge
of
the
general
body
of
doctrine
and
of
the
effect
upon
the
soul
as
a
whole
but
that
is
not
the
same
as
taking
each
small
part
and
making
all
hang
upon
that
well
norris
said
the
archbishop
i
do
not
think
we
can
talk
much
more
now
it
is
new
to
me
that
these
difficulties
are
upon
you
but
i
entreat
you
to
talk
to
me
again
as
often
as
you
will
and
to
others
also
redmayn
mr
chambers
and
others
will
be
happy
if
they
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
in
these
matters
for
few
things
indeed
would
grieve
me
more
than
that
you
should
turn
papist
anthony
thanked
the
archbishop
very
cordially
for
his
kindness
and
after
receiving
his
blessing
left
his
presence
he
had
two
or
three
more
talks
with
him
before
he
left
but
his
difficulties
were
in
no
way
resolved
the
archbishop
had
an
essentially
puritan
mind
and
could
not
enter
into
anthony
point
of
view
at
all
it
may
be
roughly
said
that
from
grindal
standpoint
all
turned
on
the
position
and
responsibility
of
the
individual
towards
the
body
to
which
he
belonged
and
that
anthony
rather
looked
at
the
corporate
side
first
and
the
individual
second
grindal
considered
for
example
the
details
of
the
catholic
religion
in
reference
to
the
individual
asking
whether
he
could
accept
this
or
that
anthony
tendency
was
rather
to
consider
the
general
question
first
and
to
take
the
difficulties
in
his
stride
afterwards
anthony
also
had
interviews
with
the
archdeacon
and
chaplain
whom
grindal
had
recommended
but
these
were
of
even
less
service
to
him
as
redmayn
was
so
frankly
contemptuous
and
mr
chambers
so
ignorant
of
the
romish
religion
that
anthony
felt
he
could
not
trust
their
judgment
at
all
in
the
meanwhile
during
this
last
fortnight
of
anthony
lambeth
life
he
received
a
letter
from
buxton
explaining
what
were
the
spiritual
exercises
to
which
he
had
referred
and
entreating
anthony
to
come
and
stay
with
him
at
stanfield
now
come
dear
norris
he
wrote
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
archbishop
service
i
will
place
three
or
four
rooms
at
your
disposal
if
you
wish
for
quiet
for
i
have
more
rooms
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
and
you
shall
make
the
exercises
if
you
will
with
some
good
priest
they
are
a
wonderful
method
of
meditation
and
prayer
designed
by
ignatius
loyola
one
day
doubtless
to
be
declared
saint
for
the
bringing
about
a
resolution
of
all
doubts
and
scruples
and
so
clearing
the
eye
of
the
soul
that
she
discerns
god
will
and
so
strengthening
her
that
she
gladly
embraces
it
and
that
surely
is
what
you
need
just
now
in
your
perplexity
the
letter
went
on
to
describe
briefly
the
method
followed
and
ended
by
entreating
him
again
to
come
and
see
him
anthony
answered
this
by
telling
him
of
his
resignation
of
his
post
at
lambeth
and
accepting
his
invitation
and
he
arranged
to
spend
the
last
three
weeks
before
easter
at
stanfield
and
to
go
down
there
immediately
upon
leaving
lambeth
he
determined
not
to
go
to
great
keynes
first
or
to
see
isabel
lest
his
resolution
should
be
weakened
already
he
thought
his
motives
were
sufficiently
mixed
and
perverted
without
his
further
aggravating
their
earthly
constituents
he
wrote
to
his
sister
however
telling
her
of
his
decision
to
leave
lambeth
and
adding
that
he
was
going
to
stay
with
a
friend
until
easter
when
he
hoped
to
return
to
the
dower
house
and
take
up
his
abode
there
for
the
present
he
received
what
he
thought
a
very
strange
letter
in
return
written
apparently
under
excitement
strongly
restrained
he
read
in
it
a
very
real
affection
for
himself
but
a
certain
reserve
in
it
too
and
even
something
of
compassion
and
there
was
a
sentence
in
it
that
above
all
others
astonished
him
has
been
here
and
is
now
gone
to
douai
oh
dear
brother
some
time
no
doubt
you
will
tell
us
all
i
feel
so
certain
that
there
is
much
to
explain
had
she
then
guessed
his
part
in
the
priest
release
anthony
wondered
but
at
any
rate
he
knew
after
his
promise
to
the
queen
that
he
must
not
give
her
any
clue
he
was
also
surprised
to
hear
that
james
had
been
to
great
keynes
he
had
inquired
for
him
at
the
tower
on
the
monday
after
his
visit
to
greenwich
and
had
heard
that
maxwell
was
already
gone
out
of
england
he
had
not
then
troubled
to
write
again
as
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
his
message
to
lady
maxwell
which
he
had
sent
in
his
note
to
isabel
had
reached
her
and
that
certainly
she
and
probably
james
too
now
knew
that
he
had
been
an
entirely
unconscious
and
innocent
instrument
in
the
priest
arrest
but
that
note
as
has
been
seen
never
reached
its
destination
lady
maxwell
did
not
care
to
write
to
the
betrayer
of
her
son
and
isabel
on
the
one
hand
hoped
and
believed
now
that
there
was
some
explanation
but
on
the
other
did
not
wish
to
ask
for
it
again
since
her
first
request
had
been
met
by
silence
as
the
last
days
of
his
life
at
lambeth
were
coming
to
an
end
anthony
began
to
send
off
his
belongings
on
to
great
keynes
and
by
the
time
that
the
saturday
before
sunday
arrived
on
which
he
was
to
leave
all
had
gone
except
his
own
couple
of
horses
and
the
bags
containing
his
personal
luggage
his
last
interview
with
the
archbishop
affected
him
very
greatly
he
found
the
old
man
waiting
for
him
walking
up
and
down
parlour
in
an
empty
part
of
the
room
where
there
was
no
danger
of
his
falling
he
peered
anxiously
at
anthony
as
he
entered
norris
he
said
you
are
greatly
on
my
mind
i
fear
i
have
not
done
my
duty
to
you
my
god
has
taken
away
the
great
charge
he
called
me
to
years
ago
to
see
if
i
were
fit
or
not
for
the
smaller
charge
of
mine
own
household
and
not
even
that
have
i
ruled
well
anthony
was
deeply
moved
my
lord
he
said
if
i
may
speak
plainly
to
you
i
would
say
that
to
my
mind
the
strongest
argument
for
the
church
of
england
is
that
she
brings
forth
piety
and
goodness
such
as
i
have
seen
here
if
it
were
not
for
that
i
should
no
longer
be
perplexed
grindal
held
up
a
deprecating
hand
do
not
speak
so
norris
that
grieves
me
however
i
beseech
you
to
forgive
me
for
all
my
remissness
towards
you
and
i
wish
to
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
you
shall
never
cease
to
have
an
old
prayers
you
have
been
a
good
and
courteous
servant
to
me
always
more
than
that
you
have
been
my
loving
friend
i
might
almost
say
my
son
and
that
in
a
world
that
has
cast
me
off
and
forgotten
me
i
shall
not
easily
forget
god
bless
you
my
dear
son
and
give
you
his
light
and
grace
when
anthony
rode
out
of
the
gateway
half
an
hour
later
with
his
servant
and
luggage
behind
him
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
could
keep
from
tears
as
he
thought
of
the
blind
old
man
living
in
loneliness
and
undeserved
disgrace
whom
he
was
leaving
behind
him
chapter
xiii
the
spiritual
exercises
anthony
found
that
buxton
had
seriously
underestimated
himself
in
describing
his
position
as
that
of
a
plain
country
gentleman
stanfield
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
houses
that
he
had
ever
seen
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
his
host
took
him
all
over
the
house
at
his
earnest
request
and
told
him
its
story
and
as
they
passed
from
room
to
room
again
and
again
anthony
found
himself
involuntarily
exclaiming
at
the
new
and
extraordinary
beauties
of
architecture
and
furniture
that
revealed
themselves
the
house
itself
had
been
all
built
in
the
present
reign
before
its
owner
had
got
into
trouble
and
had
been
fitted
throughout
on
the
most
lavish
scale
with
furniture
of
german
as
well
as
of
english
manufacture
buxton
was
a
collector
of
pictures
and
other
objects
of
art
and
his
house
contained
some
of
the
very
finest
specimens
of
painting
bronzes
enamels
plate
and
woodwork
procurable
from
the
continent
the
house
was
divided
into
two
sections
the
chief
living
rooms
were
in
a
long
suite
looking
to
the
south
on
to
the
gardens
with
a
corridor
on
the
north
side
running
the
whole
length
of
the
house
on
the
from
which
a
staircase
rose
to
a
similar
corridor
or
gallery
on
the
first
floor
the
second
section
of
the
house
was
a
block
of
some
smallish
rooms
with
a
private
staircase
of
their
own
and
a
private
entrance
and
little
walled
garden
as
well
in
front
the
house
was
mostly
panelled
throughout
and
here
and
there
hung
pieces
of
magnificent
tapestry
and
cloth
of
arras
all
was
kept
too
with
a
care
that
was
unusual
in
those
days
the
finest
woodwork
was
brought
to
a
high
polish
as
well
as
all
the
brass
utensils
and
steel
and
dogs
and
such
things
no
two
rooms
were
alike
each
possessed
some
marked
characteristic
of
its
own
one
bedroom
for
example
was
distinguished
by
its
fourpost
bed
with
its
paintings
on
the
canopy
and
head
another
by
its
little
high
window
with
adam
and
eve
in
stained
glass
another
with
a
little
containing
a
crucifix
which
was
generally
concealed
by
a
sliding
panel
another
by
two
secret
cupboards
over
the
and
its
recess
fitted
as
an
oratory
another
by
a
magnificent
piece
of
tapestry
representing
saint
clara
and
saint
thomas
of
aquin
each
holding
a
monstrance
with
a
third
great
monstrance
in
the
centre
supported
by
angels
downstairs
the
rooms
were
on
the
same
scale
of
magnificence
the
had
an
exquisite
wooden
ceiling
with
great
pendants
elaborately
carved
the
was
distinguished
by
its
glass
containing
a
collection
of
of
many
of
buxton
friends
who
had
paid
him
visits
the
hall
by
its
vast
and
the
tapestries
that
hung
round
it
the
exterior
premises
were
scarcely
less
remarkable
a
fine
row
of
stables
and
kennels
where
greyhounds
were
kept
stood
to
the
north
and
the
east
of
the
house
but
the
wonder
of
the
country
was
the
gardens
to
the
south
anthony
hardly
knew
what
to
say
for
admiration
as
he
went
slowly
through
these
with
his
host
on
the
bright
spring
morning
after
visiting
the
house
these
were
elaborately
laid
out
and
under
buxton
personal
direction
for
he
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
england
at
this
time
who
really
understood
or
cared
for
the
art
his
avenue
of
small
clipped
limes
running
down
the
main
walk
of
the
garden
his
fashioned
with
battlements
and
towers
his
great
garden
house
with
its
vane
his
fantastic
dial
in
the
fashion
of
a
tall
striped
pole
surmounted
by
a
dragon
these
were
the
astonishment
of
visitors
and
it
was
freely
said
that
had
not
buxton
been
exceedingly
adroit
he
would
have
paid
the
penalty
of
his
magnificence
and
originality
by
being
forced
to
receive
a
royal
visit
a
favour
that
would
have
gone
far
to
impoverish
if
not
to
ruin
him
the
chancel
of
the
overlooked
the
west
end
of
his
while
the
east
end
of
the
garden
terminated
in
a
great
gateway
of
stone
posts
and
wrought
iron
gates
that
looked
out
to
the
meadows
and
farm
buildings
of
the
estate
and
up
to
which
some
day
no
doubt
a
broad
carriage
drive
would
be
laid
down
but
at
present
the
sweep
of
the
meadows
was
unbroken
it
was
to
this
beautiful
place
that
anthony
found
himself
welcomed
his
host
took
him
at
once
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
to
the
west
block
and
showed
him
his
bedroom
that
with
the
little
cupboards
and
the
oratory
recess
and
then
taking
him
downstairs
again
showed
him
a
charming
little
oak
parlour
which
he
told
him
would
be
altogether
at
his
private
service
and
you
see
added
buxton
in
this
walled
garden
in
front
you
can
have
complete
privacy
and
thus
can
take
the
air
without
ever
coming
to
the
rest
of
the
house
to
which
there
is
this
one
entrance
on
the
ground
floor
and
then
he
showed
him
how
the
lower
end
of
the
long
corridor
communicated
with
the
block
the
only
partners
of
this
west
block
he
added
will
be
the
two
priests
blake
my
chaplain
and
robert
who
is
staying
with
me
a
week
or
two
and
who
i
hope
will
conduct
you
through
the
exercises
as
he
is
very
familiar
with
them
you
will
meet
them
both
at
supper
of
course
they
will
be
both
dressed
as
laymen
the
protestants
blamed
poor
campion
for
that
you
know
but
had
he
not
gone
in
disguise
they
would
only
have
hanged
him
all
the
sooner
i
like
not
hypocrisy
anthony
was
greatly
impressed
by
father
robert
when
he
met
him
at
supper
he
was
a
tall
and
big
man
who
seemed
about
forty
years
of
age
with
a
long
face
a
pointed
beard
and
moustache
and
shrewd
penetrating
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
in
advance
of
his
time
he
was
full
of
reforms
and
schemes
that
seemed
to
anthony
remarkably
to
the
point
and
they
were
reforms
too
quite
apart
from
ecclesiasticism
but
rather
such
as
would
be
classed
in
our
days
under
the
title
of
christian
socialism
for
example
he
showed
a
great
sympathy
for
the
condition
of
the
poor
and
outcast
and
criminals
and
had
a
number
of
very
practical
schemes
for
their
benefit
two
things
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question
of
anthony
i
would
do
if
i
had
the
power
first
i
would
allow
of
long
leases
for
fifty
and
a
hundred
years
everywhere
the
soil
is
becoming
impoverished
each
man
squeezes
out
of
it
as
much
as
he
can
and
troubles
not
to
feed
the
land
or
to
care
for
it
beyond
his
time
long
leases
i
hold
would
remedy
this
it
would
encourage
the
farmer
to
look
before
him
and
think
of
his
sons
and
his
sons
sons
and
second
i
would
establish
banks
for
poor
men
there
is
many
a
man
now
who
would
be
living
still
in
his
own
house
if
there
had
been
some
honest
man
whom
he
could
have
trusted
to
keep
his
money
for
him
and
maybe
give
him
something
for
the
loan
of
it
for
in
these
days
when
there
is
so
much
enterprise
money
has
become
as
it
were
a
living
thing
that
grows
or
at
the
least
a
tool
that
can
be
used
and
therefore
when
it
is
lent
it
is
right
that
the
borrower
should
pay
a
little
for
it
this
is
not
the
same
as
the
usury
that
holy
church
so
rightly
condemns
at
least
i
hold
not
though
some
i
know
differ
from
me
after
supper
the
talk
turned
on
education
here
too
the
priest
had
his
views
but
you
are
weary
of
hearing
me
he
said
in
smiling
apology
you
will
think
me
a
schoolmaster
and
i
pray
you
to
consider
me
your
pupil
said
buxton
the
priest
made
a
little
deprecating
gesture
first
then
he
said
i
would
have
a
great
increase
of
grammar
schools
it
is
grievous
to
think
of
england
as
she
will
be
when
this
generation
grows
up
the
schooling
was
not
much
before
but
now
she
has
lost
first
the
schools
that
were
kept
by
religious
and
now
the
teaching
that
the
used
to
give
but
this
perhaps
may
turn
to
advantage
for
when
the
catholic
religion
is
in
these
realms
she
will
find
how
sad
her
condition
is
and
i
hope
will
remedy
it
by
a
better
state
of
things
than
before
first
by
a
great
number
of
grammar
schools
where
the
lads
can
be
well
taught
for
small
fees
and
where
many
scholarships
will
be
endowed
and
then
so
great
will
be
the
increase
of
learning
as
i
hope
that
we
shall
need
to
have
a
third
university
to
which
i
should
join
a
third
archbishoprick
for
the
greater
dignity
of
both
and
all
this
i
should
set
in
the
north
somewhere
durham
or
newcastle
maybe
he
spoke
too
with
a
good
deal
of
shrewdness
of
the
increase
of
highway
robbery
and
the
remedies
for
it
remarking
that
although
in
other
respects
the
laws
were
too
severe
in
this
matter
their
administration
was
too
lax
since
robbers
of
gentle
birth
could
generally
rely
on
pardon
he
spoke
of
the
holy
brotherhood
in
spain
with
which
country
he
seemed
familiar
and
its
good
results
in
the
putting
down
of
violence
anthony
grew
more
and
more
impressed
by
this
man
practical
sense
and
ability
but
less
drawn
to
him
in
consequence
as
his
spiritual
guide
he
fancied
that
true
spirituality
could
scarcely
exist
in
this
intensely
practical
nature
when
supper
was
over
and
the
priests
had
gone
back
to
their
rooms
and
his
host
and
he
were
seated
before
a
wide
blazing
hearth
in
buxton
own
little
room
downstairs
he
hinted
something
of
the
sort
buxton
laughed
outright
my
dear
friend
he
said
you
do
not
know
these
jesuits
for
of
course
you
have
guessed
that
he
is
one
their
training
and
efficiency
is
beyond
all
imagining
in
a
week
from
now
you
will
be
considering
how
ever
father
robert
can
have
the
heart
to
eat
his
dinner
or
say
with
such
a
spiritual
vision
and
insight
as
he
has
you
need
not
fear
like
the
angel
in
the
revelation
he
will
call
you
up
to
heaven
hale
you
to
the
abyss
and
show
you
things
to
come
and
though
you
may
not
believe
it
it
is
the
man
intense
and
simple
piety
that
makes
him
so
and
practical
he
lives
so
close
to
god
that
god
works
and
methods
so
perplexing
to
you
and
me
are
plain
to
him
they
went
on
talking
together
for
a
while
buxton
said
that
father
robert
had
thought
it
best
for
anthony
not
to
enter
retreat
until
the
monday
evening
by
which
time
he
could
have
sufficiently
familiarised
himself
with
his
new
surroundings
so
as
not
to
find
them
a
distraction
during
his
spiritual
treatment
anthony
agreed
to
this
then
they
talked
of
all
kinds
of
things
his
host
told
him
of
his
neighbours
and
explained
how
it
was
that
he
enjoyed
such
liberty
as
he
did
you
noticed
the
church
norris
did
you
not
at
your
arrival
overlooking
the
garden
it
is
a
great
advantage
to
me
to
have
it
so
close
i
can
sit
in
my
own
garden
and
hear
the
genevan
thunders
from
within
he
preaches
so
loud
that
i
might
if
i
wished
hear
sermons
and
thus
satisfy
the
law
and
his
reverence
and
at
the
same
time
not
go
inside
an
heretical
and
thus
satisfy
my
own
conscience
and
his
holiness
but
i
fear
that
would
not
have
saved
me
had
i
not
the
ear
of
his
reverence
i
will
tell
you
how
it
was
when
the
laws
began
to
be
enforced
hereabouts
his
reverence
came
to
see
me
and
sat
in
that
very
chair
that
you
now
occupy
hear
said
he
cocking
his
eye
at
me
her
grace
is
becoming
strict
and
more
careful
for
the
souls
of
her
subjects
i
agreed
with
him
and
said
i
had
heard
as
much
fine
is
twenty
pounds
a
month
says
he
recusancy
and
then
he
looks
at
me
again
at
first
i
did
not
catch
his
meaning
for
as
you
have
noticed
norris
i
am
but
a
dull
man
in
dealing
with
these
sharp
and
subtle
protestants
and
then
all
at
once
it
flashed
across
me
your
reverence
i
said
it
will
be
the
end
of
poor
gentlemen
like
me
unless
some
kind
friend
has
pity
on
them
how
happy
i
am
in
having
you
i
said
have
never
yet
shown
my
appreciation
as
i
should
and
i
propose
now
to
give
you
to
be
applied
to
what
purposes
you
will
whether
the
sustenance
of
the
minister
or
anything
else
the
sum
of
ten
pounds
a
month
so
long
as
i
am
not
troubled
by
the
council
of
course
if
i
should
be
fined
by
the
council
i
shall
have
to
drop
my
appreciation
for
six
months
or
so
well
norris
you
will
hardly
believe
it
but
the
old
doctor
opened
his
mouth
and
gulped
and
rolled
his
eyes
like
a
trout
taking
a
fly
and
i
was
never
troubled
until
fifteen
months
ago
when
they
got
at
me
in
spite
of
him
but
he
has
lost
you
see
a
matter
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
while
i
have
been
at
wisbeach
and
i
shall
not
begin
to
appreciate
him
again
for
another
six
months
so
i
do
not
think
i
shall
be
troubled
again
anthony
was
amazed
and
said
so
well
said
the
other
i
was
astonished
too
and
should
never
have
dreamt
of
appreciating
him
in
such
a
manner
unless
he
had
proposed
it
i
had
a
little
difficulty
with
blake
who
told
me
that
it
was
a
and
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
pay
hush
money
but
i
told
him
that
he
might
call
it
what
he
pleased
but
that
i
would
sooner
pay
ten
pounds
a
month
and
be
in
peace
than
twenty
pounds
a
month
and
be
perpetually
harassed
and
father
robert
agrees
with
me
and
so
the
other
is
content
now
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
passed
quietly
mass
was
no
doubt
said
somewhere
in
the
house
though
anthony
saw
no
signs
of
it
he
himself
attended
the
reverend
doctor
ministrations
in
the
morning
and
found
him
to
be
what
he
had
been
led
to
expect
in
the
afternoon
he
walked
up
and
down
the
lime
avenue
with
father
robert
while
the
evening
prayer
and
sermon
rumbled
forth
through
the
broken
chancel
window
and
they
talked
of
the
retreat
and
the
arrangements
you
no
doubt
think
norris
said
the
priest
that
i
shall
preach
at
you
in
this
retreat
and
endeavour
to
force
you
into
the
catholic
church
but
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
the
whole
object
of
the
exercises
is
to
clear
away
the
false
motives
that
darken
the
soul
to
place
the
figure
of
our
redeemer
before
the
soul
as
her
dear
and
adorable
lover
and
king
and
then
to
kindle
and
inspire
the
soul
to
choose
her
course
through
the
grace
of
god
for
the
only
true
final
motive
of
all
perfect
action
that
is
the
pure
love
of
god
of
course
i
believe
with
the
consent
of
my
whole
being
that
the
catholic
church
is
in
the
right
but
i
shall
not
for
a
moment
attempt
to
compel
you
to
accept
her
the
final
choice
as
indeed
the
retreat
too
must
be
your
free
action
not
mine
they
arranged
too
the
details
of
the
retreat
and
anthony
was
shown
the
little
room
beyond
father
robert
bedroom
where
the
exercises
would
be
given
and
informed
that
another
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
would
come
in
every
day
for
them
too
but
that
he
would
have
his
meals
separately
and
that
anthony
himself
would
have
his
own
room
and
the
room
beneath
entirely
at
his
private
disposal
as
well
as
the
little
walled
garden
to
walk
in
the
next
day
buxton
took
anthony
a
long
ride
to
invigorate
him
for
the
retreat
that
would
begin
after
supper
anthony
learned
to
his
astonishment
and
delight
that
mary
corbet
was
a
great
friend
of
buxton
why
of
course
i
know
her
he
said
i
have
known
her
since
she
was
a
tiny
girl
and
threw
her
at
the
minister
face
the
first
time
he
read
the
morning
prayer
god
only
knows
why
she
was
so
wroth
with
the
man
for
differing
from
herself
on
a
point
that
has
perplexed
the
wisest
heads
but
at
any
rate
wroth
she
was
and
bang
went
her
book
i
had
to
take
her
out
and
she
was
spitting
like
a
kitten
all
down
the
aisle
when
the
dog
puts
his
head
into
the
basket
that
man
doing
here
she
screamed
out
the
altar
and
the
priest
and
then
at
the
door
as
luck
would
have
had
it
she
saw
that
saint
christopher
was
gone
and
she
began
bewailing
and
bemoaning
him
until
you
have
thought
he
have
been
bound
to
come
down
from
heaven
as
he
did
once
across
the
dark
river
and
see
what
in
the
world
the
crying
child
wanted
with
him
they
came
about
in
their
ride
through
the
village
of
penshurst
and
on
reaching
the
park
turned
off
under
the
beeches
towards
the
house
we
have
not
time
to
go
in
said
buxton
but
i
hope
you
will
see
the
house
sometime
it
is
a
pattern
of
what
a
house
should
be
and
has
a
pattern
master
as
they
came
up
to
the
edwardine
a
gentleman
came
riding
out
alone
why
here
he
is
said
buxton
and
greeted
him
with
great
warmth
and
made
anthony
known
to
him
i
am
delighted
to
know
norris
said
sidney
with
that
keen
friendly
look
that
was
so
characteristic
of
him
i
have
heard
of
him
from
many
quarters
he
entreated
them
to
come
in
but
buxton
said
they
had
not
time
but
would
if
they
might
just
glance
into
the
great
court
so
sidney
took
them
through
the
and
pointed
out
one
or
two
things
of
interest
from
the
entrance
the
roof
of
the
great
hall
built
by
sir
john
de
pulteney
the
rare
tracery
in
its
windows
and
the
fine
at
one
side
i
thank
god
for
it
every
day
said
sidney
gravely
i
can
not
imagine
why
he
should
have
given
it
me
i
hope
i
am
not
fool
enough
to
disparage
his
gifts
and
pretend
they
are
nothing
indeed
i
love
it
with
all
my
heart
i
would
as
soon
think
of
calling
my
wife
ugly
or
a
shrew
that
is
a
good
man
and
a
gentleman
said
buxton
as
they
rode
away
at
last
in
the
direction
of
leigh
after
leaving
sidney
to
branch
off
towards
charket
and
i
do
not
know
why
he
is
not
a
catholic
and
he
is
a
critic
and
a
poet
men
say
too
have
you
read
anything
of
his
asked
anthony
well
said
the
other
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
tried
to
read
some
sheets
of
his
that
he
wrote
for
his
sister
lady
pembroke
he
calls
it
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
finished
or
ever
will
be
but
it
seemed
to
me
wondrous
dull
it
was
full
of
shepherds
and
swains
and
nymphs
who
are
perpetually
eating
collations
which
phoebus
or
sunburnt
autumn
and
the
like
provides
of
his
bounty
or
any
one
but
god
almighty
or
else
they
are
bathing
and
surprising
one
another
all
day
long
it
is
all
very
sweet
and
exquisite
i
know
and
the
greece
where
they
all
live
and
love
one
another
must
be
a
very
delightful
country
as
unlike
this
world
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
but
it
wearies
me
i
like
plain
england
and
plain
folk
and
plain
religion
and
plain
fare
but
then
i
am
a
plain
man
as
i
tell
you
so
often
as
the
afternoon
sun
drew
near
setting
they
came
through
tonbridge
now
what
can
a
man
ask
more
said
buxton
as
they
rode
through
it
than
a
good
town
like
this
it
is
not
a
great
place
i
know
with
solemn
buildings
and
wide
streets
neither
is
it
a
glade
or
a
dell
but
it
is
a
good
clean
english
town
and
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
arcadia
or
athens
either
stanfield
lay
about
two
miles
to
the
west
and
on
their
way
out
buxton
talked
on
about
the
country
and
its
joys
and
its
usefulness
over
there
he
said
pointing
towards
eridge
was
the
first
cannon
made
in
england
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
altogether
to
its
credit
but
it
at
least
shows
that
we
are
not
quite
idle
and
loutish
in
the
country
then
all
about
here
is
the
iron
the
very
stirrups
you
ride
in
norris
most
likely
came
from
the
ground
beneath
your
feet
but
it
is
sad
to
see
all
the
woods
cut
down
for
the
smelting
of
it
all
these
places
for
miles
about
here
and
about
great
keynes
too
are
all
named
after
the
things
of
forestry
and
hunting
buckhurst
hartfield
sevenoaks
forest
row
and
the
like
all
tell
of
the
country
and
will
do
so
long
after
we
are
dead
and
gone
they
reached
stanfield
rode
past
the
green
and
the
large
piece
of
water
there
and
up
the
long
village
street
and
turned
into
the
iron
gates
beyond
the
church
just
as
the
dusk
fell
that
evening
after
supper
the
retreat
began
the
conduct
of
the
spiritual
exercises
had
not
reached
the
elaboration
to
which
they
have
been
perfected
since
nor
in
anthony
case
a
layman
and
a
young
man
did
father
robert
think
fit
to
apply
it
even
in
all
the
details
in
which
it
would
be
used
for
a
priest
or
for
one
far
advanced
in
the
spiritual
life
but
it
was
severe
enough
every
evening
father
robert
indicated
the
subject
of
the
following
meditation
and
then
after
private
prayer
anthony
retired
to
his
room
he
rose
about
seven
in
the
morning
and
took
a
little
food
at
eight
then
shortly
before
nine
the
first
meditation
was
given
elaborately
the
first
examination
of
conscience
was
made
at
eleven
followed
by
dinner
at
from
twelve
to
one
anthony
rested
in
his
room
then
until
three
he
was
encouraged
to
walk
in
the
garden
at
three
the
meditation
was
to
be
recalled
point
by
point
in
the
chapel
followed
by
spiritual
reading
at
five
supper
was
served
and
at
six
the
meditation
was
repeated
with
tremendous
emphasis
and
fervent
acts
of
devotion
at
eight
a
slight
collation
was
laid
in
his
room
and
at
nine
the
meditation
for
the
following
day
was
given
father
robert
in
his
previous
talks
with
anthony
had
given
him
instructions
as
to
how
to
occupy
his
own
time
to
keep
his
thoughts
fixed
and
so
forth
he
had
thought
it
wise
too
not
to
extend
the
retreat
for
longer
than
a
fortnight
so
that
it
was
proposed
to
end
it
on
palm
sunday
two
or
three
times
in
the
week
anthony
rode
out
by
himself
and
father
robert
was
always
at
his
service
besides
himself
coming
sometimes
to
talk
to
him
when
he
thought
the
strain
or
the
monotony
was
getting
too
heavy
as
for
the
exercises
themselves
the
effect
of
them
on
anthony
was
beyond
all
description
first
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
given
were
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
their
effectiveness
there
was
every
aid
that
romance
and
mystery
could
give
then
it
was
in
a
strange
and
beautiful
house
where
everything
tended
to
caress
the
mind
out
of
all
the
little
panelled
room
in
which
the
exercises
were
given
looked
out
over
the
quiet
garden
and
no
sound
penetrated
there
but
the
muffled
noises
of
the
peaceful
village
life
the
rustle
of
the
wind
in
the
evergreens
and
the
occasional
coo
or
soft
flapping
flight
of
a
pigeon
from
the
cote
in
the
garden
the
room
itself
was
furnished
with
two
or
three
faldstools
and
upright
wooden
of
tolerable
comfort
a
table
was
placed
at
the
further
end
on
which
stood
a
realistic
spanish
crucifix
with
two
tapers
always
burning
before
it
and
a
little
jar
of
fragrant
herbs
then
there
was
the
continual
sense
of
slight
personal
danger
that
is
such
a
spur
to
refined
natures
here
was
a
catholic
house
of
which
every
member
was
strictly
subject
to
penalties
and
above
all
one
of
that
mysterious
society
of
jesus
the
very
vanguard
of
the
catholic
army
and
of
which
every
member
was
a
picked
and
trained
champion
then
there
was
the
amazing
enthusiasm
experience
and
skill
of
father
robert
as
he
called
himself
who
knew
human
nature
as
an
anatomist
knows
the
structure
of
the
human
body
to
whom
the
bewildering
tangle
of
motives
good
bad
and
indifferent
in
the
soul
was
as
plain
as
paths
in
a
garden
who
knew
what
human
nature
needed
what
it
could
dispense
with
what
was
its
power
of
resistance
and
who
had
at
his
disposal
for
the
storming
of
the
soul
an
armoury
of
weapons
and
engines
every
specimen
of
which
he
had
tested
and
wielded
over
and
over
again
little
as
anthony
knew
it
father
robert
during
the
first
two
days
after
his
arrival
had
occupied
himself
with
sounding
and
probing
the
soul
trying
his
intellect
by
questions
that
scarcely
seemed
to
be
so
taking
the
temperature
of
his
emotional
nature
by
tales
and
adroit
remarks
and
watching
the
effect
of
them
in
short
with
studying
the
soul
who
had
come
for
his
treatment
as
a
careful
doctor
examines
the
health
of
a
new
patient
before
he
issues
his
prescription
and
then
lastly
there
were
the
exercises
themselves
a
mighty
weapon
in
any
hands
and
all
but
irresistible
when
directed
by
the
skill
and
inspired
by
the
enthusiasm
and
sincere
piety
of
such
a
man
as
father
robert
the
exercises
fell
into
three
parts
each
averaging
in
anthony
case
about
five
days
first
came
the
purgative
exercises
the
object
of
these
was
to
cleanse
and
search
out
the
very
recesses
of
the
soul
as
fire
separates
gold
from
alloy
as
anthony
knelt
in
the
little
room
before
the
crucifix
day
by
day
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
old
conventional
limitations
and
motives
of
action
and
control
were
rolling
back
revealing
the
realities
of
the
spiritual
world
the
exercises
began
with
an
elaborate
exposition
of
the
end
of
man
which
may
be
roughly
defined
as
the
glory
of
god
attained
through
the
saving
and
sanctifying
of
the
individual
every
creature
of
god
then
that
the
soul
encounters
must
be
tested
by
this
rule
how
far
does
the
use
of
it
serve
for
the
final
end
for
it
must
be
used
so
far
and
no
farther
here
then
was
a
diagram
of
the
exercises
given
in
miniature
at
the
beginning
then
the
great
facts
that
practically
all
men
acknowledge
and
upon
which
so
few
act
were
brought
into
play
hell
judgment
and
death
in
turn
began
to
work
upon
the
lad
soul
these
monstrous
elemental
truths
that
underlie
all
things
as
father
robert
deep
vibrating
voice
spoke
it
appeared
to
anthony
as
if
the
room
the
walls
the
house
the
world
all
shrank
to
filmy
nothingness
before
the
appalling
realities
of
these
things
in
that
strange
and
profound
exercise
of
the
senses
he
heard
the
moaning
and
the
blasphemies
of
the
damned
of
those
rebellious
free
wills
that
have
enslaved
themselves
into
eternal
bondage
by
a
deliberate
rejection
of
god
he
put
out
his
finger
and
tasted
the
bitterness
of
their
furious
tears
the
very
reek
of
sin
came
to
his
nostrils
of
that
corruption
that
is
in
existence
through
sin
nay
he
saw
the
very
flaming
hells
red
with
man
wrath
against
his
maker
then
he
traced
back
under
the
priest
direction
the
judgment
through
which
every
soul
must
pass
he
saw
the
dead
great
and
small
stand
before
god
the
books
black
with
blotted
shame
were
borne
forth
by
the
recording
angels
and
spread
before
the
tribunal
his
ears
tingled
with
that
condemning
silence
of
the
judge
beyond
whom
there
is
no
appeal
from
whose
sentence
there
is
no
respite
and
from
whose
prison
there
is
no
discharge
and
rang
with
that
pealing
at
which
the
angels
hide
their
faces
but
to
which
the
conscience
of
the
criminal
assents
that
it
is
just
his
soul
looked
out
at
those
whirling
hosts
on
either
side
that
black
cloud
going
down
to
despair
that
radiant
company
hastening
to
rise
to
the
uncreated
light
in
whom
there
is
no
darkness
at
all
and
cried
in
piteous
suspense
to
know
on
which
side
she
herself
one
day
would
be
then
he
came
yet
one
step
further
back
still
and
told
himself
the
story
of
his
death
he
saw
the
little
room
where
he
would
lie
his
bed
in
one
corner
he
saw
isabel
beside
the
bed
he
saw
himself
white
gasping
convulsed
upon
it
the
shadows
of
the
doctor
and
the
priest
were
upon
the
wall
he
heard
his
own
quick
sobbing
breath
he
put
out
his
finger
and
touched
his
own
forehead
wet
with
the
he
tasted
and
smelt
the
faint
sickly
atmosphere
that
hangs
about
a
death
chamber
and
he
watched
the
grey
shadow
of
azrael
wing
creep
across
his
face
then
he
saw
the
sheet
and
the
stiff
form
beneath
it
and
knew
that
they
were
his
features
that
were
hidden
and
that
they
were
his
feet
that
stood
up
stark
below
the
covering
then
he
visited
his
own
grave
and
saw
the
grass
blowing
upon
it
and
the
little
cross
at
the
head
then
he
dug
down
through
the
soil
swept
away
the
earth
from
his
drew
the
screws
and
lifted
the
lid
then
he
placed
sin
beneath
the
white
light
dissected
it
analysed
it
weighed
it
and
calculated
its
worth
watched
its
development
in
the
congenial
surroundings
of
an
innocent
soul
that
is
rich
in
grace
and
leisure
and
gifts
and
saw
the
astonishing
reversal
of
god
primal
law
illustrated
in
the
process
of
corruption
the
fair
sweet
fragrant
creature
passing
into
foulness
he
looked
carefully
at
the
stages
and
modes
of
sin
venial
sins
those
tiny
ulcers
that
weaken
poison
and
spoil
the
soul
even
if
they
do
not
slay
it
lukewarmness
that
deathly
slumber
that
engulfs
the
living
thing
into
gradual
death
and
finally
mortal
sin
that
one
and
only
wholly
hideous
thing
he
saw
the
indescribable
sight
of
a
naked
soul
in
mortal
sin
he
saw
how
the
earth
shrank
from
it
how
nature
grew
silent
at
it
how
the
sun
darkened
at
it
how
hell
yelled
at
it
and
the
love
of
god
sickened
at
it
and
so
as
the
purgative
days
went
by
these
tempests
poured
over
his
soul
sifted
through
it
as
the
sea
through
a
hanging
weed
till
all
that
was
not
organically
part
of
his
life
was
swept
away
and
he
was
left
a
simple
soul
alone
with
god
then
the
second
process
began
to
change
the
metaphor
the
canvas
was
now
prepared
scoured
bleached
and
stretched
what
is
the
image
to
be
painted
upon
it
it
is
the
image
of
christ
now
father
robert
laid
aside
his
knives
and
his
hammer
and
took
up
his
soft
brushes
and
began
stroke
by
stroke
with
colours
beyond
imagining
to
lay
upon
the
eager
canvas
the
likeness
of
an
adorable
lover
and
king
anthony
watched
the
portrait
grow
day
by
day
with
increasing
wonder
was
this
indeed
the
jesus
of
nazareth
of
whom
he
had
read
in
the
gospels
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
and
yet
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistake
line
for
line
it
was
the
same
but
this
portrait
grew
and
breathed
and
moved
and
passed
through
all
the
stages
of
man
life
first
it
was
the
eternal
word
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
the
beloved
son
who
looked
in
compassion
upon
the
warring
world
beneath
and
offered
himself
to
the
father
who
gave
him
through
the
energy
of
the
blessed
spirit
then
it
was
a
silent
maid
that
he
saw
waiting
upon
god
offering
herself
with
her
lily
beside
her
and
in
answer
on
a
sudden
came
the
lightning
of
gabriel
appearing
and
lo
the
eternal
word
stole
upon
her
down
a
ray
of
glory
and
then
at
last
he
saw
the
dear
child
born
and
as
he
looked
he
was
invited
to
enter
the
stable
and
again
he
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
coarse
straw
that
lay
in
the
manger
and
fingered
the
rough
brown
cord
that
hung
from
mary
waist
and
smelled
the
sweet
breath
of
the
cattle
and
the
burning
oil
of
joseph
lantern
hung
against
the
wall
and
shivered
as
the
night
wind
shrilled
under
the
door
and
awoke
the
tender
child
then
he
watched
him
grow
to
boyhood
increasing
in
wisdom
and
stature
him
who
was
uncreated
wisdom
and
in
whose
hands
are
the
worlds
followed
him
loving
him
more
at
every
step
to
and
from
the
well
at
nazareth
with
the
pitcher
on
his
head
saw
him
with
blistered
hands
and
aching
back
in
the
carpenter
shop
then
at
last
went
south
with
him
to
jordan
listened
with
him
hungering
to
the
jackals
in
the
wilderness
rocked
with
him
on
the
high
temple
spire
stared
with
him
at
the
empires
of
all
time
and
refused
them
as
a
gift
then
he
went
with
him
from
miracle
to
miracle
laughed
with
joy
at
the
leper
new
skin
wept
in
sorrow
and
joy
with
the
mother
at
nain
and
the
two
sisters
at
bethany
knelt
with
mary
and
kissed
his
feet
went
home
with
matthew
and
zaccheus
and
sat
at
meat
with
the
merry
sinners
and
at
last
began
to
follow
silent
and
amazed
with
face
set
towards
jerusalem
up
the
long
lonely
road
from
jericho
then
with
love
that
almost
burned
his
heart
he
crouched
at
the
moonlit
door
outside
and
watched
the
supper
begin
judas
pushed
by
him
muttering
and
vanished
in
the
shadows
of
the
street
he
heard
the
hush
fall
as
the
bread
was
broken
and
the
red
wine
uplifted
and
he
hid
his
face
for
he
dared
not
yet
look
with
john
upon
a
glory
whose
veils
were
so
thin
then
he
followed
the
silent
company
through
the
overhung
streets
to
the
temple
courts
and
down
across
the
white
bridge
to
the
garden
door
then
bolder
he
drew
near
left
the
eight
and
the
three
and
knelt
close
to
the
single
figure
who
sobbed
and
trembled
and
sweated
blood
then
he
heard
the
clash
of
weapons
and
saw
the
glare
of
the
torches
and
longed
to
warn
him
but
could
not
saw
the
bitter
shame
of
the
kiss
and
the
arrest
and
the
flight
and
followed
to
caiaphas
house
heard
the
stinging
slap
ran
to
pilate
house
saw
that
polished
gentleman
yawn
and
sneer
saw
the
clinging
thongs
and
the
splashed
floor
when
the
scourging
was
over
followed
on
to
calvary
saw
the
great
cross
rise
up
at
last
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
heard
the
storm
of
hoots
and
laughter
and
the
dry
sobs
of
the
few
women
then
over
his
head
the
sun
grew
dull
and
the
earth
rocked
and
split
as
the
crosses
reeled
with
their
swinging
burdens
then
as
the
light
came
back
and
the
earth
ended
her
long
shudder
he
saw
in
the
evening
glow
that
his
lord
was
dead
then
he
followed
to
the
tomb
saw
the
stone
set
and
sealed
and
the
watch
appointed
and
went
home
with
mary
and
john
and
waited
then
on
easter
morning
wherever
his
lord
was
he
was
there
too
with
mary
in
that
unrecorded
visit
with
the
women
with
the
apostles
on
the
road
to
emmaus
on
the
lake
of
galilee
and
his
heart
burned
with
christ
at
his
side
on
lake
and
road
and
mountain
then
at
last
he
stood
with
the
twelve
and
saw
that
end
that
was
so
glorious
a
beginning
saw
that
tender
sky
overhead
generate
its
strange
cloud
that
was
the
door
of
heaven
heard
far
away
the
trumpets
cry
and
the
harps
begin
to
ripple
for
the
new
song
that
the
harpers
had
learned
at
last
and
then
followed
with
his
eyes
the
lord
whom
he
had
now
learned
to
know
and
love
as
never
before
as
he
passed
smiling
and
blessing
into
the
heaven
from
which
one
day
he
will
return
there
then
as
anthony
looked
on
the
canvas
was
that
living
moving
face
and
figure
what
more
could
he
have
done
that
he
did
not
do
what
perfection
could
be
dreamed
of
that
was
not
already
a
thousand
times
his
and
when
the
likeness
was
finished
and
father
robert
stepped
aside
from
the
portrait
that
he
had
painted
with
such
tender
skill
and
love
it
is
little
wonder
that
this
lad
threw
himself
down
before
that
eloquent
vision
and
cried
with
thomas
my
lord
and
my
god
then
very
gently
father
robert
led
him
through
those
last
steps
up
from
the
illuminative
to
the
unitive
from
the
incarnate
life
with
its
warm
human
interests
to
that
ineffable
light
that
seems
so
chill
and
unreal
to
those
who
only
see
it
through
the
clouds
of
earth
into
that
keen
icy
stillness
where
only
favoured
and
souls
can
breathe
up
the
piercing
air
of
the
slopes
that
lead
to
the
throne
and
there
in
the
listening
silence
of
heaven
where
the
voice
of
adoration
itself
is
silent
through
sheer
intensity
where
all
colours
return
to
whiteness
and
all
sounds
to
stillness
all
forms
to
essence
and
all
creation
to
the
creator
there
he
let
him
fall
in
love
and
wonder
breathe
out
his
soul
in
one
ardent
act
and
make
his
choice
chapter
xiv
easter
day
holy
week
passed
for
anthony
like
one
of
those
strange
dreams
in
which
the
sleeper
awakes
to
find
tears
on
his
face
and
does
not
know
whether
they
are
for
joy
or
sorrow
at
the
end
of
the
retreat
that
closed
on
palm
sunday
evening
anthony
had
made
his
choice
and
told
father
robert
it
was
not
the
exercises
themselves
that
were
the
direct
agent
any
more
than
were
the
books
he
had
read
the
books
had
cleared
away
intellectual
difficulties
and
the
retreat
moral
obstacles
and
left
his
soul
desiring
the
highest
keen
to
see
it
and
free
to
embrace
it
the
thought
that
he
would
have
to
tell
isabel
appeared
to
him
of
course
painful
and
difficult
but
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
his
conversion
he
made
an
arrangement
with
father
robert
to
be
received
at
cuckfield
on
easter
eve
so
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
telling
isabel
before
he
took
the
actual
step
the
priest
told
him
he
would
give
him
a
letter
to
barnes
so
that
he
might
be
received
immediately
upon
his
arrival
holy
week
then
was
occupied
for
anthony
in
receiving
instruction
each
morning
in
the
little
oak
parlour
from
father
robert
and
in
attending
the
devotions
in
the
evening
with
the
rest
of
the
household
he
also
heard
mass
each
day
it
was
impossible
of
course
to
carry
out
the
special
devotions
of
the
season
with
the
splendour
and
elaboration
that
belonged
to
them
but
anthony
was
greatly
impressed
by
what
he
saw
the
tender
reverence
with
which
the
catholics
loved
to
linger
over
the
details
of
the
passion
and
to
set
them
like
precious
jewels
in
magnificent
liturgical
settings
and
then
to
perform
these
stately
approaches
to
god
with
all
the
dignity
and
solemnity
possible
appealed
to
him
in
strong
contrast
to
the
cold
and
loveless
services
as
he
now
thought
them
of
the
established
church
that
he
had
left
on
the
good
friday
evening
he
was
long
in
the
parlour
with
father
robert
i
am
deeply
thankful
my
son
he
said
kindly
that
you
have
been
able
to
come
to
a
decision
of
course
i
could
have
wished
you
to
enter
the
society
but
god
has
not
given
you
a
vocation
to
that
apparently
however
you
can
do
great
work
for
him
as
a
seminary
priest
and
i
am
exceedingly
glad
that
you
will
be
going
to
douai
so
soon
i
must
just
put
my
affairs
in
order
at
home
he
said
and
see
what
arrangements
my
sister
will
wish
to
make
and
by
midsummer
at
the
latest
i
shall
hope
to
be
gone
i
must
be
off
early
said
the
priest
i
have
to
be
far
from
here
by
night
in
a
house
where
i
shall
hope
to
stay
until
i
too
go
abroad
again
possibly
we
may
meet
at
douai
in
the
autumn
well
my
son
pray
for
me
anthony
knelt
for
his
blessing
and
the
priest
was
gone
presently
buxton
came
in
and
sat
down
he
was
full
of
delight
at
the
result
of
his
scheme
and
said
so
again
and
again
who
could
have
predicted
it
he
cried
to
think
that
you
were
visiting
me
in
prison
fifteen
months
ago
and
now
this
has
come
about
in
my
house
truly
the
gospel
blessing
on
your
action
has
not
been
long
on
the
way
and
that
you
will
be
a
priest
too
you
must
come
and
be
my
chaplain
some
day
if
we
are
both
alive
and
escape
the
gallows
so
long
old
blake
is
sore
displeased
with
me
i
am
a
trial
to
him
i
know
he
will
hardly
speak
to
me
in
my
own
house
i
declare
i
tremble
when
i
meet
him
in
the
gallery
for
fear
he
will
rate
me
before
my
servants
i
forget
what
his
last
grievance
is
but
i
think
it
is
something
to
do
with
a
saint
that
he
wishes
me
to
be
devout
to
and
i
do
not
like
her
of
course
i
do
not
doubt
her
sanctity
but
blake
always
confuses
veneration
and
liking
i
yield
to
none
in
my
veneration
for
saint
but
i
do
not
like
her
and
that
is
an
end
of
the
matter
after
a
little
more
talk
buxton
looked
at
anthony
curiously
a
moment
or
two
and
then
said
i
wonder
you
have
not
guessed
yet
who
father
robert
is
for
i
am
sure
you
know
that
that
can
not
be
his
real
name
anthony
looked
at
him
wonderingly
well
he
is
in
bed
now
and
will
be
off
early
and
i
have
his
leave
to
tell
you
he
is
father
persons
of
whom
you
may
have
heard
anthony
stared
yes
said
his
host
the
companion
of
campion
all
the
world
supposes
him
to
be
in
rome
and
i
think
that
not
persons
besides
ourselves
know
where
he
is
but
at
this
moment
i
assure
you
father
robert
persons
of
the
society
of
jesus
is
asleep
or
awake
as
the
case
may
be
in
the
little
tapestry
chamber
overhead
now
went
on
buxton
that
you
are
one
of
us
i
will
tell
you
quite
plainly
that
father
robert
as
we
will
continue
to
call
him
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
most
devout
priests
that
ever
said
mass
and
also
one
of
the
most
shrewd
men
that
ever
drew
breath
but
i
can
not
follow
him
everywhere
you
will
find
anthony
that
the
catholics
in
england
are
of
two
kinds
those
who
seem
to
have
as
their
motto
the
text
i
quoted
to
you
in
lambeth
prison
and
who
count
their
duty
to
c√¶sar
as
scarcely
less
important
than
their
direct
duty
to
god
i
am
one
of
these
i
sincerely
desire
above
all
things
to
serve
her
grace
and
i
would
not
for
all
the
world
join
in
any
confederacy
to
dethrone
her
for
i
hold
she
is
my
lawful
and
true
prince
then
there
is
another
party
who
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
take
part
against
their
prince
though
i
do
not
say
to
the
slaying
of
her
if
thereby
the
catholic
religion
could
be
established
again
in
these
realms
it
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
point
and
i
understand
well
how
honest
and
good
men
can
hold
that
view
for
they
say
and
rightly
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
the
first
thing
in
the
world
and
while
they
may
not
commit
sin
of
course
to
further
it
yet
in
things
indifferent
they
must
sacrifice
all
for
it
and
they
add
it
is
indifferent
as
to
who
sits
on
the
throne
of
england
therefore
one
prince
may
be
pushed
off
it
so
long
as
no
crime
is
committed
in
the
doing
of
it
and
another
seated
there
if
thereby
the
religion
may
be
so
established
again
you
see
the
point
anthony
no
doubt
and
how
fine
and
delicate
it
is
well
father
robert
is
i
think
of
that
party
and
so
are
many
of
the
authorities
abroad
now
i
tell
you
all
this
and
on
this
sacred
day
too
because
i
may
have
no
other
opportunity
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
startled
or
offended
after
you
have
become
a
catholic
and
i
entreat
you
to
be
warm
and
kindly
to
those
who
take
other
views
than
your
own
for
i
fear
that
many
troubles
lie
in
front
of
us
of
our
own
causing
for
there
are
divisions
amongst
us
already
although
not
at
all
of
course
for
which
i
thank
god
on
any
of
the
saving
truths
of
the
faith
anthony
excitement
on
hearing
father
robert
real
name
was
very
great
as
he
lay
in
bed
that
night
the
thought
of
it
all
would
hardly
let
him
sleep
he
turned
to
and
fro
trying
to
realise
that
there
within
a
dozen
yards
of
him
lay
the
famous
jesuit
for
whose
blood
all
protestant
england
was
clamouring
the
name
of
persons
was
still
sinister
and
terrible
even
to
this
convert
and
he
could
scarcely
associate
in
his
thoughts
all
its
suggestiveness
with
that
kindly
fervent
lover
of
jesus
christ
who
had
led
him
with
such
skill
and
tenderness
along
the
way
of
the
gospel
others
in
england
were
similarly
astonished
in
later
years
to
learn
that
a
famous
puritan
book
of
devotions
was
scarcely
other
than
a
reprint
of
father
persons
christian
directory
the
following
day
about
noon
after
an
affectionate
to
his
host
and
blake
anthony
rode
out
of
the
gates
and
down
the
village
street
in
the
direction
of
great
keynes
it
was
a
perfect
overhead
there
was
a
soft
blue
sky
with
translucent
clouds
floating
in
it
underfoot
and
on
all
sides
the
mystery
of
life
was
beginning
to
stir
and
manifest
itself
the
last
touch
of
bitterness
had
passed
from
the
breeze
and
all
living
growth
was
making
haste
out
into
the
air
the
hedges
were
green
with
open
buds
and
bubbling
with
the
laughter
and
ecstasy
of
the
birds
the
high
sloping
overhung
sussex
lanes
were
sweet
with
violets
and
primroses
and
here
and
there
under
the
boughs
anthony
saw
the
blue
carpet
of
spread
rabbits
whisked
in
and
out
of
the
roots
superintending
and
provisioning
the
crowded
nurseries
underground
and
as
anthony
came
out
now
and
again
on
the
higher
and
open
spaces
larks
vanished
up
their
airy
spirals
of
song
into
the
illimitable
blue
or
hung
visible
musical
specks
against
a
fleecy
cloud
pouring
down
their
thin
cataract
of
melody
and
as
he
rode
for
every
note
of
music
and
every
glimpse
of
colour
round
him
his
own
heart
poured
out
pulse
after
pulse
of
that
spiritual
essence
that
lies
beneath
all
beauty
and
from
which
all
beauty
is
formed
to
the
maker
of
all
this
and
the
saviour
of
himself
there
were
set
wide
before
him
now
the
gates
of
a
kingdom
compared
to
which
this
realm
of
material
life
round
about
was
but
a
cramped
and
wintry
prison
after
all
how
long
he
had
lived
in
the
cold
and
the
dark
he
thought
kept
alive
by
the
refracted
light
that
stole
down
the
steps
to
where
he
sat
in
the
shadow
of
death
saved
from
freezing
by
the
warmth
of
grace
that
managed
to
survive
the
chill
about
him
and
all
the
while
the
catholic
church
was
glowing
and
pulsating
with
grace
close
to
him
and
yet
unseen
that
great
realm
full
of
heavenly
sunlight
that
was
the
life
of
all
its
members
that
sunlight
that
had
poured
down
so
steadily
ever
since
the
winter
had
rolled
away
on
calvary
and
that
ever
since
then
had
been
elaborating
and
developing
into
a
thousand
intricate
forms
all
that
was
capable
of
absorbing
it
one
by
one
the
great
arts
had
been
drawn
into
that
kingdom
transformed
and
immortalised
by
the
vital
and
miraculous
sap
of
grace
philosophies
languages
sciences
all
in
turn
were
taken
up
and
sanctified
and
now
this
puritan
soul
thirsty
for
knowledge
and
grace
and
so
long
starved
and
imprisoned
was
entering
at
last
into
her
heritage
all
this
was
of
course
but
dimly
felt
in
the
direct
perceptions
of
anthony
but
father
robert
had
said
enough
to
open
something
of
the
vision
and
he
himself
had
sufficient
apprehension
to
make
him
feel
that
the
old
meagre
life
was
passing
away
and
a
new
life
of
unfathomed
possibilities
beginning
as
he
rode
the
wilderness
appeared
to
rejoice
and
blossom
like
the
rose
as
the
spring
of
nature
and
grace
stirred
about
and
within
him
and
only
an
hour
or
two
ride
away
lay
the
very
hills
and
streams
of
the
promised
land
about
three
he
crossed
the
london
road
and
before
four
he
rode
round
to
the
door
of
the
dower
house
dismounted
telling
the
groom
to
keep
his
horse
saddled
he
went
straight
through
the
hall
calling
isabel
as
he
went
and
into
the
garden
carrying
his
flat
cap
and
whip
and
gloves
and
as
he
came
out
beneath
the
holly
tree
there
she
stood
before
him
on
the
top
of
the
old
stone
garden
steps
that
rose
up
between
earthen
to
the
on
the
north
of
the
house
he
went
across
the
grass
smiling
and
as
he
came
saw
her
face
grow
whiter
and
whiter
she
was
in
a
dark
serge
dress
with
a
plain
ruff
and
a
hood
behind
it
and
her
hair
was
coiled
in
great
masses
on
her
head
she
stood
trembling
and
he
came
up
and
took
her
in
his
arms
tenderly
and
kissed
her
for
his
news
would
be
heavy
presently
why
isabel
he
said
you
look
astonished
to
see
me
but
i
could
not
well
send
a
man
as
i
had
only
geoffrey
with
me
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
and
looked
so
overwhelmed
and
terrified
that
anthony
grew
frightened
he
saw
he
must
be
very
gentle
sit
down
he
said
drawing
her
to
a
seat
beside
the
path
at
the
head
of
the
steps
and
tell
me
the
news
by
a
great
effort
she
regained
her
i
did
not
know
when
you
were
coming
she
said
tremulously
i
was
startled
he
talked
of
his
journey
for
a
few
minutes
and
of
the
kindness
of
the
friend
with
whom
he
had
been
staying
and
the
beauty
of
the
house
and
grounds
and
so
on
until
she
seemed
herself
again
and
the
piteous
startled
look
had
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
then
he
forced
himself
to
approach
his
point
for
the
horse
was
waiting
saddled
and
he
must
get
to
cuckfield
and
back
by
supper
if
possible
he
took
her
hand
and
played
with
it
gently
as
he
spoke
turning
over
her
rings
isabel
he
said
i
have
news
to
tell
you
it
is
not
bad
news
at
least
i
think
not
it
is
the
best
thing
that
has
ever
come
to
me
yet
by
the
grace
of
god
and
so
you
need
not
be
anxious
or
frightened
but
i
am
afraid
you
may
think
it
bad
news
it
it
is
about
religion
isabel
he
glanced
at
her
and
saw
that
terrified
look
again
in
her
face
she
was
staring
at
him
and
her
hand
in
his
began
to
twitch
and
tremble
nay
nay
he
said
there
is
no
need
to
look
like
that
i
have
not
lost
my
faith
in
god
rather
i
have
gained
it
isabel
i
am
going
to
be
a
catholic
a
curious
sound
broke
from
her
lips
and
a
look
so
strange
came
into
her
face
that
he
threw
his
arm
round
her
thinking
she
was
going
to
faint
and
he
spoke
sharply
isabel
isabel
what
is
there
to
fear
look
at
me
then
a
cry
broke
from
her
white
lips
and
she
struggled
to
stand
up
no
no
no
you
are
mocking
me
oh
anthony
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
treat
me
like
this
mocking
he
said
before
god
i
am
not
my
horse
is
waiting
to
take
me
to
the
priest
but
but
she
began
again
oh
then
what
have
you
done
to
james
maxwell
james
maxwell
why
what
do
you
mean
you
got
my
note
no
no
there
was
no
answer
he
said
anthony
stared
why
i
wrote
and
then
lady
maxwell
does
she
not
know
and
james
himself
isabel
shook
her
head
and
looked
at
him
wildly
well
well
that
must
wait
one
thing
at
a
time
he
said
i
wait
now
i
must
go
to
cuckfield
ah
isabel
say
you
understand
once
or
twice
she
began
to
speak
but
failed
and
sat
panting
and
staring
at
him
my
darling
he
said
do
not
look
like
that
we
are
both
christians
still
we
at
least
serve
the
same
god
surely
you
will
not
cast
me
off
for
this
cast
you
off
she
said
and
she
laughed
piteously
and
sharply
and
then
was
grave
again
then
she
suddenly
cried
oh
anthony
swear
to
me
you
are
not
mocking
me
my
darling
he
said
why
should
i
mock
you
i
have
made
the
exercises
and
have
been
instructed
and
i
have
here
a
letter
to
barnes
from
the
priest
who
has
taught
me
so
that
i
may
be
received
and
make
my
easter
duties
and
geoffrey
is
still
at
the
door
holding
roland
to
take
me
to
cuckfield
to
cuckfield
she
said
you
will
not
find
barnes
there
not
there
why
not
where
shall
i
find
him
how
do
you
know
because
he
is
here
she
went
on
in
the
same
strange
voice
at
the
hall
well
said
anthony
that
saves
me
a
journey
why
is
he
here
he
is
here
to
say
mass
ah
and
and
what
is
it
isabel
and
to
receive
me
into
the
church
the
brother
and
sister
walked
up
and
down
that
soft
spring
evening
after
supper
on
the
with
the
whispers
and
caresses
of
the
scented
breeze
about
them
the
shy
dewy
eyes
of
the
stars
looking
down
at
them
between
the
tall
spires
of
the
evergreens
overhead
and
in
their
hearts
the
joy
of
lovers
on
a
anthony
had
soon
told
the
tale
of
james
maxwell
and
isabel
had
nearly
knelt
to
ask
her
brother
pardon
for
having
ever
allowed
even
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
to
darken
her
heart
lady
maxwell
too
who
had
come
down
with
her
sister
to
see
isabel
about
some
small
arrangement
was
told
and
she
too
had
been
nearly
overwhelmed
with
the
joy
of
knowing
that
the
lad
was
innocent
and
the
grief
of
having
dreamed
he
could
be
otherwise
and
at
the
wholly
unexpected
news
of
his
conversion
but
she
had
gone
at
last
back
to
the
hall
to
make
all
ready
for
the
double
ceremony
of
that
night
and
the
paschal
feast
on
the
next
day
mistress
margaret
was
in
room
moving
about
with
a
candle
and
every
time
that
the
two
reached
the
turn
at
the
top
of
the
steps
they
saw
her
light
glimmering
then
anthony
as
they
walked
under
the
stars
told
isabel
of
his
great
hope
that
he
too
one
day
would
be
a
priest
and
serve
god
and
his
countrymen
that
way
oh
anthony
she
whispered
and
clung
to
that
dear
arm
that
held
her
own
terrified
for
the
moment
at
the
memory
of
what
had
been
the
price
of
priesthood
to
james
maxwell
and
where
shall
you
be
trained
for
it
she
asked
at
douai
and
isabel
i
think
i
must
go
this
summer
this
summer
she
said
why
and
she
was
silent
anthony
she
went
on
i
would
like
to
tell
you
about
hubert
and
then
the
story
of
the
past
months
came
out
she
turned
away
her
face
as
she
talked
and
at
last
she
told
him
how
hubert
had
come
for
his
answer
a
week
before
his
time
it
was
on
monday
she
said
i
heard
him
on
the
stairs
and
stood
up
as
he
came
in
and
he
stopped
at
the
door
in
silence
and
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
i
could
hear
him
breathing
quickly
and
then
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
all
and
i
dropped
down
into
my
chair
again
and
hid
my
face
in
my
arm
and
burst
into
crying
and
still
he
said
nothing
but
i
felt
him
come
close
up
to
me
and
kneel
down
by
me
and
he
put
his
hand
over
mine
and
held
them
tight
and
then
he
whispered
in
a
kind
of
quick
way
will
be
what
you
please
catholic
or
protestant
or
what
you
will
and
i
lifted
my
head
and
looked
at
him
because
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
him
hubert
say
that
and
he
was
whiter
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
and
then
then
he
began
to
wrinkle
his
mouth
you
know
the
way
he
does
when
his
horse
is
pulling
or
kicking
and
then
he
began
to
say
all
kinds
of
things
and
oh
i
was
so
sorry
because
he
had
behaved
so
well
till
then
what
did
he
say
asked
anthony
quickly
ah
i
have
tried
to
forget
said
isabel
i
do
not
want
to
think
of
him
as
he
was
when
he
was
angry
and
disappointed
at
last
he
flung
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
and
i
have
not
seen
him
since
but
lady
maxwell
sent
for
me
the
same
evening
an
hour
later
and
told
me
that
she
could
not
live
there
any
longer
she
said
that
hubert
had
ridden
off
to
london
and
would
not
be
down
again
till
whitsuntide
but
that
she
must
be
gone
before
then
so
i
am
afraid
that
he
said
things
he
ought
not
but
of
course
she
did
not
tell
me
one
word
and
she
asked
me
to
go
with
her
and
and
anthony
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
because
i
did
not
know
what
you
would
do
when
you
heard
that
i
was
a
catholic
i
was
waiting
to
tell
you
when
you
came
home
but
now
but
now
oh
anthony
my
darling
at
last
the
two
came
indoors
mistress
margaret
met
them
in
the
hall
she
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
two
at
anthony
in
his
satin
and
lace
and
his
smiling
face
over
his
ruff
and
his
steady
brown
eyes
and
isabel
on
his
arm
with
her
clear
pale
face
and
bosom
and
black
hair
and
her
velvet
and
lace
and
a
rope
of
pearls
why
said
the
old
nun
smiling
you
look
a
pair
of
lovers
then
presently
the
three
went
together
up
to
the
hall
an
hour
or
two
passed
away
the
paschal
moon
was
rising
high
over
the
tall
yew
hedge
behind
the
italian
garden
and
the
hall
lay
beneath
it
with
silver
roofs
and
vane
and
black
shadows
under
the
eaves
and
in
the
angles
the
tall
oriel
window
of
the
hall
looking
on
to
the
terrace
shone
out
with
candlelight
and
the
armorial
coats
of
the
maxwells
and
the
families
they
had
married
with
glimmered
in
the
upper
panes
from
the
cloister
wing
there
shone
out
above
the
curtains
lines
of
light
in
lady
maxwell
suite
of
rooms
and
the
little
oak
parlour
beneath
as
well
as
from
one
or
two
other
rooms
but
the
rest
of
the
house
with
the
exception
of
the
great
hall
and
the
servants
quarters
was
all
dark
it
was
as
if
the
interior
life
had
shifted
westwards
leaving
the
remainder
desolate
the
gardens
to
the
south
were
silent
for
the
night
breeze
had
dropped
and
the
faint
ripple
of
the
fountain
within
the
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
and
once
or
twice
the
sleepy
chirp
of
a
bird
nestling
by
his
mate
in
the
deep
shrubberies
showed
that
the
life
of
the
spring
was
beating
out
of
sight
and
then
at
last
the
door
in
the
west
angle
of
the
terrace
between
the
cloister
wing
and
the
front
of
the
house
opened
and
a
flood
of
mellow
light
poured
out
on
to
the
flat
pavement
a
group
stood
within
the
little
oaken
lobby
lady
maxwell
and
her
sister
slender
and
dignified
in
their
dark
evening
dresses
and
ruffs
anthony
holding
his
cap
and
isabel
with
a
lace
shawl
over
her
head
and
at
the
back
the
white
hair
and
ruddy
face
of
old
barnes
in
his
cassock
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
as
mistress
margaret
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
lady
maxwell
took
isabel
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
then
anthony
took
the
old
lady
hand
and
kissed
it
but
she
threw
her
other
hand
round
him
and
kissed
him
too
on
the
forehead
then
without
another
word
the
brother
and
sister
came
out
into
the
moonlight
passed
down
the
side
of
the
cloister
wing
and
turning
once
to
salute
the
group
who
waited
framed
and
bathed
in
golden
light
they
turned
the
corner
to
the
dower
house
then
the
door
closed
the
oriel
window
suddenly
darkened
and
an
hour
after
the
lights
in
the
wing
went
out
and
maxwell
hall
lay
silver
and
grey
again
in
the
moonlight
the
night
passed
on
once
isabel
awoke
and
saw
her
windows
blue
and
mystical
and
her
room
full
of
a
dim
radiance
from
the
bright
night
outside
it
was
irresistible
and
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
window
across
the
cool
polished
oak
floor
and
leaned
with
her
elbows
on
the
sill
looking
out
at
the
square
of
lawn
and
the
low
ivied
wall
beneath
and
the
tall
trees
rising
beyond
and
in
the
brilliant
glory
that
poured
down
from
almost
directly
overhead
for
the
paschal
moon
was
at
its
height
above
the
house
and
then
suddenly
the
breathing
silence
was
broken
by
a
ripple
of
melody
and
another
joined
and
another
and
isabel
looked
and
wondered
and
listened
for
she
had
never
heard
before
the
music
of
the
mysterious
of
the
larks
all
soaring
and
singing
together
when
the
rest
of
the
world
is
asleep
and
she
listened
and
wondered
as
the
stream
of
song
poured
down
from
the
wonderful
spaces
of
the
sky
rising
to
ecstasies
as
the
wheeling
world
sank
yet
further
with
its
sleeping
meadows
and
woods
beneath
the
whirling
singers
and
then
the
earth
for
a
moment
turned
in
its
sleep
as
isabel
listened
and
the
trees
stirred
as
one
deep
breath
came
across
the
woods
and
a
thrush
murmured
a
note
or
two
beside
the
drive
and
a
rabbit
suddenly
awoke
in
the
field
and
ran
on
to
the
lawn
and
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
white
figure
at
the
window
and
far
away
from
the
direction
of
lindfield
a
stag
brayed
so
longeth
my
soul
whispered
isabel
to
herself
then
all
grew
still
again
the
trees
hushed
the
torrent
of
music
more
tumultuous
as
it
neared
the
earth
suddenly
ceased
and
isabel
at
the
window
leaned
further
out
and
held
her
hands
in
the
bath
of
light
and
spoke
softly
into
the
night
oh
lord
jesus
how
kind
thou
art
to
me
then
at
last
the
morning
came
and
christ
was
risen
beyond
a
doubt
just
before
the
sun
came
up
when
all
the
sky
was
luminous
to
meet
him
the
two
again
passed
up
and
round
the
corner
and
into
the
little
door
in
the
angle
there
was
the
same
shaded
candle
or
two
for
the
house
was
yet
dark
within
and
they
passed
up
and
on
together
through
the
into
the
chapel
where
each
had
made
a
first
confession
the
night
before
and
had
together
been
received
into
the
catholic
church
now
it
was
all
fragrant
with
flowers
and
herbs
a
pair
of
tall
lilies
leaned
their
delicate
heads
towards
the
altar
as
if
to
listen
for
the
soundless
coming
in
the
name
of
the
lord
underfoot
all
about
the
altar
lay
sprigs
of
sweet
herbs
rosemary
thyme
lavender
with
white
blossoms
scattered
over
them
a
soft
carpet
for
the
pierced
feet
not
like
those
rustling
over
which
he
rode
to
death
last
week
the
black
oak
chest
that
supported
the
was
glorious
in
its
vesture
of
and
against
the
wall
at
the
back
behind
the
silver
candlesticks
leaned
the
gold
plate
of
the
house
to
do
honour
to
the
king
and
presently
there
stood
there
the
radiant
rustling
figure
of
the
priest
his
personality
sheathed
and
obliterated
beneath
the
splendid
symbolism
of
his
vestments
stiff
and
chinking
with
jewels
as
he
moved
the
glorious
mass
of
easter
day
began
est
christus
itaque
saint
paul
cried
from
the
south
corner
of
the
altar
to
the
two
converts
christ
our
passover
is
sacrificed
for
us
therefore
let
us
keep
the
feast
but
not
with
the
old
leaven
revolvet
nobis
lapidem
wailed
the
women
who
shall
roll
us
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
when
they
looked
cried
the
triumphant
evangelist
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
for
it
was
very
great
quippe
magnus
here
then
they
knelt
at
last
these
two
come
home
together
these
who
had
followed
their
several
paths
so
resolutely
in
the
dark
not
knowing
that
the
other
was
near
yet
each
seeking
a
hidden
lord
and
finding
both
him
and
one
another
now
in
the
full
and
visible
glory
of
his
face
jam
for
the
sun
of
righteousness
had
dawned
and
there
was
healing
for
all
sorrows
in
his
wings

their

cried
all
together
i

at
last
in
a
catholic
church
one
for
it
is
built
on

its
faith
is
one

for
it
is
the
daughter
of

and
the

of

for
it

guided
by
the

i
count
all

and

and

and

and

when
i
look
to
that
everlasting
life
and
him
who
is
the
way
to
it
so
from
step
to
step
the
liturgy
moved
on
with
its
sonorous
and
exultant
tramp
and
the
crowding
thoughts
forgot
themselves
and
watched
as
the
splendid
heralds
went
by
the
triumphant
trumpets
of
in
had
long
died
away
the
proclamation
of
the
names
and
titles
of
the
prince
had
been
made
dominum
jesum
dei
patre
natum
ante
omnia
de
de
verum
de
deo
non
then
his
first
achievement
had
been
declared
quem
omnia
facta
then
his
great
and
later
triumphs
how
he
had
ridden
out
alone
from
the
palace
and
come
down
the
steep
of
heaven
in
quest
of
his
love
how
he
had
disguised
himself
for
her
sake
and
by
the
crowning
miracle
of
love
the
mightiest
work
that
almighty
god
has
ever
wrought
he
was
made
man
and
the
herald
hushed
his
voice
in
awe
as
he
declared
it
and
the
people
threw
themselves
prostrate
in
honour
of
this
high
and
lowly
prince
then
was
recounted
the
tale
of
those
victories
that
looked
so
bitterly
like
failures
and
the
people
held
their
breath
and
whispered
it
too
then
in
rising
step
after
step
his
last
conquests
were
told
how
the
black
knight
was
overthrown
his
castle
stormed
and
his
prison
burst
and
the
story
of
the
triumph
of
the
return
and
of
the
coronation
and
the
enthronement
at
the
father
right
hand
on
high
the
heralds
passed
on
and
mysterious
figures
came
next
bearing
melchisedech
gifts
shadowing
the
tremendous
event
that
follows
on
behind
after
a
space
or
two
came
the
first
lines
of
the
bodyguard
the
heavenly
creatures
dimly
seen
moving
through
clouds
of
glory
angels
dominations
powers
heavens
virtues
and
blessed
seraphim
all
crying
out
together
to
heaven
and
earth
to
welcome
him
who
comes
after
in
the
bright
shadow
of
the
name
of
the
lord
and
the
trumpets
peal
out
for
the
last
time
hosanna
in
the
highest
then
a
hush
fell
and
presently
in
the
stillness
came
riding
the
great
personages
who
stand
in
heaven
about
the
throne
first
the
queen
mother
herself
glorious
within
and
without
moving
in
clothing
of
wrought
gold
high
above
all
others
then
the
great
princes
of
the
blood
royal
who
are
admitted
to
drink
of
the
king
own
cup
and
sit
beside
him
on

the

with
rugged
faces
and
scarred
hands
and
with
them
great
mitred
figures
linus
cletus
and
clement
with
their
companions
and
then
another
space
and
a
tingling
silence
the
crowds
bow
down
like
corn
before
the
wind
the
trumpets
are
silent
and
he
comes
he
comes
on
he
moves
treading
under
foot
the
laws
he
has
made
yet
borne
up
by
them
as
on
the
sea
of
galilee
he
who
inhabits
eternity
at
an
instant
is
made
present
he
who
transcends
space
is
immanent
in
material
kind
he
who
never
leaves
the
father
side
rests
on
his
white
linen
carpet
held
yet
unconfined
in
the
midst
of
the
little
gold
things
and
embroidery
and
and
lilies
while
the
fragrance
of
the
herbs
rises
about
him
there
rests
the
gracious
king
before
this
bending
group
the
rest
of
the
pageant
dies
into
silence
and
nothingness
outside
the
radiant
circle
of
his
presence
there
is
his
immediate
who
has
marked
out
this
for
the
prince
bowing
before
him
striving
by
gestures
to
interpret
and
fulfil
the
silence
that
words
must
always
leave
empty
here
behind

the
adoring
human
hearts
each
looking
with
closed
eyes
into
the
face
of
the
fairest
of
the
children
of

each
crying
silently
words
of
adoration
welcome
and
utter
love
the
moments
pass
the

are
performed
the
virgins
that
follow
the
lamb

and
the
rest
step
forward
smiling
and
take
their
part
the
eternal
father
is
invoked
again
in
the
son
own
words
and
at
length
the
king
descending
yet
one
further
step
of
infinite
humility
flings
back
the
last
vesture
of
his
outward
royalty
and
casts
himself
in
a
passion
of
haste
and
desire
into
the
still
and
invisible
depths
of
these
two
quivering
hearts
made
in
his
own
image
that
lift
themselves
in
an
agony
of
love
to
meet
him
meanwhile
the

morning
is
deepening

rising
above

stirred
and
murmured
last

is
pouring
out
his
song

that
rose
into

in

of

waiting
for
those
who

they
come
the

silent

together
out
into

of

part
iii
chapter
i
the
coming
of
spain
the
conflict
between
the
old
faith
and
the
lusty
young
nation
went
steadily
forward
after
the
jesuit
invasion
more
and
more
priests
poured
into
england
more
and
more
were
banished
imprisoned
and
put
to
death
the
advent
of
father
holt
the
jesuit
to
scotland
in
was
a
signal
for
a
new
outburst
of
catholic
feeling
which
manifested
itself
not
only
in
greater
devotion
to
religion
but
among
the
and
impatient
in
very
questionable
proceedings
in
fact
from
this
time
onward
the
catholic
cause
suffered
greatly
from
the
division
of
its
supporters
into
two
groups
the
religious
and
the
political
as
they
may
be
named
the
former
entirely
repudiated
any
desire
or
willingness
to
meddle
with
civil
matters
its
members
desired
to
be
both
catholics
and
englishmen
serving
the
pope
in
matters
of
faith
and
elizabeth
in
matters
of
civil
life
but
they
suffered
greatly
from
the
indiscretions
and
fanaticism
of
the
political
group
the
members
of
that
party
frankly
regarded
themselves
as
at
war
with
an
usurper
and
an
heretic
and
used
warlike
methods
to
gain
their
ends
plots
against
the
queen
life
were
set
on
foot
and
their
promoters
were
willing
enough
to
die
in
defence
of
the
cause
but
the
civil
government
made
the
fatal
mistake
of
not
distinguishing
between
the
two
groups
again
and
again
loyal
englishmen
were
tortured
and
hanged
as
traitors
because
they
shared
their
faith
with
conspirators
there
was
one
question
however
that
was
indeed
on
the
borderline
exceedingly
difficult
to
answer
in
words
especially
for
scrupulous
consciences
and
that
was
whether
they
believed
in
the
pope
deposing
power
and
this
question
was
adroitly
and
deliberately
used
by
the
government
in
doubtful
cases
to
ensure
a
conviction
but
whether
or
not
it
was
possible
to
frame
a
satisfactory
answer
in
words
yet
the
accused
were
plain
enough
in
their
deeds
and
when
the
armada
at
length
was
launched
in
there
were
no
more
loyal
defenders
of
england
than
the
persecuted
catholics
even
before
this
however
there
had
appeared
signs
of
reaction
among
the
protestants
especially
against
the
torture
and
death
of
campion
and
his
fellows
and
lord
burghley
in
attempted
to
quiet
the
people
resentment
by
his
anonymous
pamphlet
execution
of
justice
in
england
to
which
cardinal
allen
presently
replied
ireland
which
had
been
profoundly
stirred
by
the
military
expedition
from
the
continent
in
at
length
was
beaten
and
slashed
into
submission
again
and
the
torture
and
execution
of
hurley
by
martial
law
which
elizabeth
directed
on
account
of
his
appointment
to
the
see
of
cashel
when
the
judges
had
pronounced
there
to
be
no
case
against
him
and
a
massacre
on
the
banks
of
the
moy
in
of
scots
who
had
come
across
as
reinforcements
to
the
irish
these
were
incidents
in
the
black
list
of
barbarities
by
which
at
last
a
sort
of
temporary
quiet
was
brought
to
ireland
in
scottish
affairs
the
tangle
unravelled
even
still
of
which
mary
stuart
was
the
centre
led
at
last
to
her
death
walsingham
with
extraordinary
skill
managed
to
tempt
her
into
a
dangerous
correspondence
all
of
which
he
tapped
on
the
way
he
supplied
to
her
in
fact
the
very
instrument
an
ingeniously
made
through
which
the
correspondence
was
made
possible
and
after
reading
all
the
letters
forwarded
them
to
their
several
destinations
when
all
was
ripe
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
a
group
of
zealots
to
whose
designs
mary
was
supposed
to
be
privy
and
after
their
execution
finally
succeeded
in
in
obtaining
elizabeth
signature
to
her
cousin
the
storm
already
raging
against
elizabeth
on
the
continent
but
fanned
to
fury
by
this
execution
ultimately
broke
in
the
spanish
armada
in
the
following
year
meanwhile
at
home
the
affairs
of
the
church
of
england
were
far
from
prosperous
puritanism
was
rampant
and
a
wail
of
dismay
was
evoked
by
the
new
demands
of
a
commission
under
whitgift
guidance
in
whereby
the
puritan
divines
were
now
called
upon
to
assent
to
the
supremacy
the
articles
and
the
prayer
book
in
spite
of
the
opposition
however
of
burghley
and
the
commons
whitgift
who
had
by
this
time
succeeded
to
canterbury
upon
grindal
death
remained
firm
and
a
long
and
dreary
dispute
began
embittered
further
by
the
execution
of
copping
and
thacker
in
for
issuing
seditious
books
in
the
puritan
cause
a
characteristic
action
in
this
campaign
was
the
issuing
of
a
puritan
manifesto
in
consisting
of
a
brief
pamphlet
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pages
under
the
title
a
learned
discourse
of
ecclesiastical
government
making
the
inconsistent
claim
of
desiring
a
return
to
the
primitive
and
scriptural
model
and
at
the
same
time
of
advocating
an
original
scheme
one
not
yet
handled
it
was
practically
a
demand
for
the
presbyterian
system
of
pastorate
and
government
to
this
bridges
replies
with
a
tremendous
tome
of
over
fourteen
hundred
pages
discharged
after
three
years
of
laborious
toil
and
dealing
as
the
custom
then
was
line
by
line
with
the
puritan
attack
to
this
in
the
following
year
an
anonymous
puritan
under
the
name
of
martin
marprelate
retorts
with
a
brilliant
and
sparkling
riposte
addressed
to
the
right
puissant
and
terrible
priests
my
of
the
in
which
he
mocks
bitterly
at
the
prelates
accusing
them
of
and
popery
calling
one
dumb
and
duncetical
another
the
veriest
coxcomb
that

indeed
a

under
suspicion
of
avarice
dishonesty
vanity

and
the

a

was
universally
reprobated
as
covetous
stingy
and
weak
in
civil
matters
england
relation
with
spain
was
her
most
important
concern
bitter
feeling
had
been
growing
steadily
between
the
two
countries
ever
since
drake
piracies
in
the
spanish
dominions
in
america
and
a
gradually
increasing
fleet
at
cadiz
was
the
outward
sign
of
it
now
the
bitterness
was
deepened
by
the
arrest
of
english
ships
in
the
spanish
ports
in
the
early
summer
of
and
the
swift
reprisals
of
drake
in
the
autumn
who
intimidated
and
robbed
important
towns
on
the
coast
such
as
vigo
where
his
men
behaved
with
revolting
irreverence
in
the

and
santiago

then
proceeded
to

of

to

stormed

destroyed

at

captured
the
great
elizabeth
was
no
doubt
encouraged
in
her
apparent
recklessness
by
the
belief
that
with
the
netherlands
which
she
had
been
compelled
at
last
to
assist
in
a
state
of
revolt
spain
would
have
little
energy
for
reprisals
upon
england
but
she
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
when
news
continued
to
arrive
in
england
of
the
growing
preparations
for
the
armada
france
too
was
now
so
much
involved
with
internal
struggles
as
the
protestant
henry
of
navarre
was
now
the
heir
to
her
catholic
throne
that
efficacious
intervention
could
no
longer
be
looked
for
from
that
quarter
and
it
seemed
at
last
as
if
the
gigantic
southern
power
was
about
to
inflict
punishment
upon
the
little
northern
kingdom
which
had
insulted
her
with
impunity
so
long
in
the
october
of
certain
news
arrived
in
england
of
the
gigantic
preparations
being
made
in
spain
and
elsewhere
and
hearts
began
to
beat
and
tongues
to
clack
and
couriers
to
gallop
then
as
the
months
went
by
and
tidings
sifted
in
there
was
something
very
like
consternation
in
the
country
men
told
one
another
of
the
huge
armament
that
was
on
its
way
the
vast
ships
and
guns
all
bearing
down
on
tiny
england
like
a
bull
on
a
terrier
they
spoke
of
the
religious
fervour
like
that
of
a
crusade
that
inspired
the
invasion
and
was
bringing
the
flower
of
the
spanish
nobility
against
them
the
superstitious
contrasted
their
own
and
with
the
spanish
and
lady
of
the
the
more
practical
thought
with
even
deeper
gloom
of
the
dismal
parsimony
of
the
queen
who
dribbled
out
stores
and
powder
so
reluctantly
and
dismissed
her
seamen
at
the
least
hint
of
delay
yet
little
by
little
as
midsummer
came
and
went
beacons
were
gathering
on
every
hill
ships
were
approaching
efficiency
and
troops
assembling
at
tilbury
under
the
supremely
incompetent
command
of
lord
leicester
among
the
smaller
seaports
on
the
south
coast
rye
was
one
of
the
most
active
and
enthusiastic
the
broad
shallow
bay
was
alive
with
and
the
steep
cobbled
streets
of
the
town
were
filled
all
day
with
a
chattering
exultant
crowd
cheering
every
group
of
seamen
that
passed
and
that
spent
long
hours
at
the
quay
watching
the
busy
life
of
the
ships
and
predicting
the
great
things
that
should
fall
when
the
spaniards
encountered
the
townsfolk
should
the
armada
survive
onslaught
further
west
about
july
the
twentieth
more
definite
news
began
to
arrive
at
least
once
a
day
a
courier
dashed
in
through
the
gate
with
news
that
all
must
hold
themselves
ready
to
meet
the
enemy
by
the
end
of
the
month
labour
grew
more
incessant
and
excitement
more
feverish
about
six
on
the
evening
of
the
as
a
long
row
of
powder
barrels
was
in
process
of
shipping
down
on
the
quay
the
men
who
were
rolling
them
suddenly
stopped
and
listened
the
line
of
onlookers
paused
in
their
comments
and
turned
round
from
the
town
above
came
an
outburst
of
cries
followed
by
the
crash
of
the
alarm
from
the
in
two
minutes
the
quay
was
empty
out
of
every
passage
that
gave
on
to
the
main
street
poured
excited
men
and
women
some
hysterically
laughing
some
swearing
some
silent
and
white
as
they
ran
for
across
the
bay
westwards
on
a
point
beyond
winchelsea
in
the
still
evening
air
rose
up
a
stream
of
smoke
shaped
like
a
with
a
red
smouldering
root
and
immediately
afterwards
in
answer
the
ypres
tower
behind
the
town
was
pouring
out
a
thick
drifting
cloud
that
told
to
the
watchers
on
folkestone
cliffs
that
the
dreaded
and
foe
was
in
sight
of
england
then
the
solemn
hours
of
waiting
began
to
pass
every
day
and
night
there
were
watchers
straining
their
eyes
westwards
in
case
the
armada
should
attempt
to
coast
along
england
to
force
a
landing
anywhere
and
southwards
in
case
they
should
pass
nearer
the
french
coast
on
their
way
to
join
the
prince
of
parma
but
there
was
little
to
be
seen
over
that
wide
ring
of
blue
sea
except
single
vessels
or
now
and
again
in
company
appearing
and
fading
again
on
some
unknown
quest
the
couriers
that
came
in
daily
could
not
tell
them
much
only
that
there
had
been
indecisive
engagements
that
the
spaniards
had
not
yet
attempted
a
landing
anywhere
and
that
it
was
supposed
that
they
would
not
do
so
until
a
union
with
the
force
in
flanders
had
been
effected
and
so
four
days
of
the
following
week
passed
then
on
thursday
august
the
fourth
within
an
hour
or
two
after
sunrise
the
solemn
booming
of
guns
began
far
away
to
the
but
the
hours
passed
and
before
nightfall
all
was
silent
again
the
suspense
was
terrible
all
night
long
there
were
groups
parading
the
streets
anxiously
conjecturing
now
despondently
now
cheerfully
then
once
again
on
the
friday
morning
a
sudden
clamour
broke
out
in
the
town
and
almost
simultaneously
a
pinnace
slipped
out
spreading
her
wings
and
making
for
the
open
sea
a
squadron
of
english
ships
had
been
sighted
flying
eastwards
and
the
pinnace
was
gone
to
get
news
the
ships
were
watched
anxiously
by
thousands
of
eyes
and
boats
put
out
all
along
the
coast
to
inquire
and
within
two
or
three
hours
the
pinnace
was
back
again
in
rye
harbour
with
news
that
set
bells
ringing
and
men
shouting
on
wednesday
the
skipper
reported
there
had
been
an
indecisive
engagement
during
the
dead
calm
that
had
prevailed
in
the
channel
a
couple
of
spanish
had
been
taken
on
the
following
morning
and
a
general
action
had
followed
which
again
had
been
indecisive
but
in
which
the
english
had
hardly
suffered
at
all
while
it
was
supposed
that
great
havoc
had
been
wrought
upon
the
enemy
but
the
best
of
the
news
was
that
the
rye
contingent
was
to
set
sail
at
once
and
unite
with
the
english
fleet
westward
of
calais
by
on
saturday
the
squadron
that
had
passed
was
under
the
command
of
the
admiral
himself
who
was
going
to
dover
for
provisions
and
ammunition
and
would
return
to
his
fleet
before
evening
before
many
hours
were
passed
rye
harbour
was
almost
empty
and
hundreds
of
eyes
were
watching
the
ships
that
carried
their
husbands
and
sons
and
lovers
out
into
the
pale
summer
haze
that
hung
over
the
coast
of
france
while
a
few
old
mariners
on
points
of
vantage
muttered
to
one
another
that
in
the
haze
there
was
a
patch
of
white
specks
to
be
seen
which
betokened
the
presence
of
some
vast
fleet
that
night
the
sun
set
yellow
and
stormy
and
by
morning
the
of
rye
were
wet
and
dripping
with
and
a
swell
was
beginning
to
lap
and
sob
against
the
harbour
walls
chapter
ii
men
of
war
and
peace
the
following
days
passed
in
terrible
suspense
for
all
left
behind
at
rye
every
morning
all
the
points
of
vantage
were
crowded
the
ypres
tower
itself
was
never
deserted
day
or
night
and
all
the
sharpest
eyes
in
the
town
were
bent
continually
out
over
that
leaden
rolling
sea
that
faded
into
haze
and
in
the
direction
of
the
french
coast
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
on
that
waste
of
waters
but
the
single
boats
that
flew
up
channel
or
laboured
down
it
against
the
squally
west
wind
far
out
at
sea
once
or
twice
put
in
at
rye
but
their
reports
were
so
contradictory
and
uncertain
that
they
increased
rather
than
allayed
the
suspense
and
misery
now
it
was
a
french
boat
that
reported
the
destruction
of
the
now
an
englishman
that
swore
to
having
seen
drake
kill
with
his
own
hand
on
his
poop
but
whatever
the
news
might
be
the
unrest
and
excitement
ran
higher
and
higher
clare
chapel
in
the
old
parish
church
of
nicholas
was
crowded
every
morning
at
five
by
an
excited
congregation
of
women
who
came
to
beg
god
protection
on
their
dear
ones
struggling
out
there
somewhere
towards
the
dawn
with
those
cruel
southern
monsters
especially
great
was
the
crowd
on
the
tuesday
morning
following
the
departure
of
the
ships
for
all
day
on
monday
from
time
to
time
came
a
rolling
noise
from
the
direction
of
calais
which
many
declared
to
be
thunder
with
an
angry
emphasis
that
betrayed
their
real
opinion
when
they
came
out
of
church
that
morning
and
were
streaming
down
to
the
quay
as
usual
to
see
if
any
news
had
come
in
during
the
night
a
seaman
called
to
them
from
a
window
that
a
french
vessel
was
just
entering
the
harbour
when
the
women
arrived
at
the
water
edge
they
found
a
good
crowd
already
assembled
on
the
quay
watching
the
ship
beat
in
against
the
wind
which
had
now
set
in
but
she
aroused
no
particular
comment
as
she
was
a
boat
plying
between
boulogne
and
rye
and
by
seven
she
was
made
fast
to
the
quay
there
were
the
usual
formalities
stricter
than
usual
during
war
to
be
gone
through
before
the
few
passengers
were
allowed
to
land
but
all
was
in
order
the
officers
left
the
boat
and
the
passengers
came
up
the
plank
the
crowd
pressing
forward
as
they
came
and
questioning
them
eagerly
no
there
was
no
certain
news
said
an
englishman
at
last
who
looked
like
a
lawyer
it
was
said
at
boulogne
the
night
before
that
there
had
been
an
engagement
further
up
beyond
the
straits
they
had
all
heard
guns
and
it
was
reported
by
the
last
cruiser
who
came
in
before
the
boat
left
that
a
spanish
galleasse
had
run
aground
and
had
been
claimed
by
gourdain
the
governor
of
calais
but
probably
added
the
man
that
was
just
a
piece
of
their
dirty
french
pride
the
crowd
smiled
ruefully
and
a
french
officer
of
the
boat
who
was
standing
by
the
gangway
scowled
savagely
as
the
lawyer
passed
on
with
a
demure
face
then
there
was
a
pause
in
the
little
stream
of
passengers
and
then
out
of
the
tiny
door
that
led
below
decks
walking
swiftly
and
carrying
a
long
cloak
over
her
arm
came
isabel
norris
in
a
grey
travelling
dress
followed
by
anthony
and
a
couple
of
servants
the
crowd
fell
back
for
the
lady
who
passed
straight
up
through
them
but
one
or
two
of
the
men
called
out
for
news
to
anthony
he
shook
his
head
cheerfully
at
them
i
know
no
more
than
that
gentleman
he
said
nodding
towards
the
lawyer
and
then
followed
isabel
and
together
they
made
their
way
up
to
the
inn
anthony
was
a
good
deal
changed
in
the
last
six
years
his
beard
and
moustache
were
well
grown
and
he
had
a
new
look
of
gravity
in
his
brown
eyes
when
he
had
smiled
and
shaken
his
head
at
the
eager
crowd
just
now
showing
his
white
regular
teeth
he
looked
as
young
as
ever
but
the
serious
look
fell
on
his
face
again
as
he
followed
isabel
up
the
steep
little
cobbled
slope
in
his
buff
dress
and
plumed
hat
there
was
not
so
much
apparent
change
in
isabel
she
was
a
shade
graver
too
her
walk
a
little
slower
and
more
dignified
and
her
lips
a
little
thinner
had
a
line
of
strength
in
them
that
was
new
and
even
now
as
she
was
treading
english
ground
again
for
the
first
time
for
six
years
the
look
of
slight
abstraction
in
her
eyes
that
is
often
the
sign
of
a
strong
inner
life
was
just
a
touch
deeper
than
it
used
to
be
they
went
up
together
with
scarcely
a
word
and
asked
for
a
private
room
and
dinner
in
two
hours
time
and
a
carriage
and
horses
for
the
servants
to
be
ready
at
noon
the
landlord
who
had
met
them
at
the
door
shook
his
head
the
private
room
sir
and
the
dinner
yes
sir
but
the
horses
and
he
spread
his
hands
out
deprecatingly
there
is
not
one
in
the
stall
he
added
anthony
considered
a
moment
well
what
do
you
propose
we
are
willing
to
stay
a
day
or
two
if
you
think
that
by
then
ah
said
the
landlord
is
another
matter
i
expect
two
of
my
carriages
home
sir
from
london
but
the
horses
will
not
be
able
to
travel
till
noon
that
will
do
said
anthony
and
he
followed
isabel
upstairs
it
was
very
strange
to
them
both
to
be
back
in
england
after
so
long
they
had
settled
down
at
douai
with
the
maxwells
but
almost
immediately
on
their
arrival
mistress
margaret
was
sent
for
by
her
superior
to
the
house
of
her
order
at
brussels
and
lady
maxwell
was
left
alone
with
isabel
in
a
house
in
the
town
for
anthony
was
in
the
seminary
then
in
lady
maxwell
had
died
quite
suddenly
isabel
herself
had
found
her
at
her
in
the
morning
still
in
her
evening
dress
she
was
leaning
partly
against
the
wall
her
wrinkled
old
hands
were
clasped
tightly
together
on
a
little
ivory
crucifix
on
the
top
of
the
desk
and
her
head
with
the
lace
drooping
from
it
like
a
bridal
veil
was
bowed
below
them
isabel
who
had
not
dared
to
move
her
had
sent
instantly
for
a
little
french
doctor
who
had
thrown
up
his
hands
in
a
kind
of
devout
ecstasy
at
that
wonderful
old
figure
rigid
in
an
eternal
prayer
the
two
tall
tapers
she
had
lighted
eight
hours
before
were
still
just
alight
beside
her
and
looked
strange
in
the
morning
sunshine
pendant
ses
oraisons
pendant
ses
oraisons
he
murmured
over
and
over
again
and
then
had
fallen
on
his
knees
and
kissed
the
drooping
lace
of
her
sleeve
priez
pour
moi
madame
he
whispered
to
the
motionless
figure
and
so
the
old
catholic
who
had
suffered
so
much
had
gone
to
her
rest
the
fact
that
her
son
james
had
been
living
in
the
college
during
her
four
years
stay
at
douai
had
been
perhaps
the
greatest
possible
consolation
to
her
for
being
obliged
to
be
out
of
england
for
she
saw
him
almost
daily
and
it
was
he
who
sang
her
requiem
isabel
had
then
gone
to
live
with
other
friends
in
douai
until
anthony
had
been
ordained
priest
in
the
june
of
and
was
ready
to
take
her
to
england
and
now
the
two
were
bound
for
stanfield
where
anthony
was
to
act
as
chaplain
for
the
present
as
buxton
had
predicted
so
long
before
old
blake
had
died
in
the
spring
of
the
year
still
disapproving
of
his
patron
liberal
notions
and
buxton
had
immediately
sent
a
special
messenger
all
the
way
to
douai
to
secure
anthony
services
and
had
insisted
moreover
that
isabel
should
accompany
her
brother
they
intended
however
to
call
at
the
dower
house
on
the
way
which
had
been
left
under
the
charge
of
old
carroll
and
renew
the
memories
of
their
own
dear
home
they
talked
little
at
dinner
and
only
of
general
matters
their
journey
the
armada
their
joy
at
getting
home
again
for
they
had
been
expressly
warned
by
their
friends
abroad
against
any
indiscreet
talk
even
when
they
thought
themselves
alone
and
especially
in
the
seaports
where
so
constant
a
watch
was
kept
for
seminary
priests
the
presence
of
isabel
however
was
the
greatest
protection
to
anthony
as
it
was
almost
unknown
that
a
priest
should
travel
with
any
but
male
companions
then
suddenly
as
they
were
ending
dinner
a
great
clamour
broke
out
in
the
town
below
them
a
gun
was
fired
somewhere
and
footsteps
began
to
rush
along
the
narrow
street
outside
anthony
ran
to
the
window
and
called
to
know
what
was
the
matter
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
and
he
presently
sat
down
again
in
despair
and
with
one
or
two
wistful
looks
i
will
go
immediately
he
said
to
isabel
and
bring
you
word
a
moment
after
a
servant
burst
into
the
room
it
is
a
spanish
ship
sir
he
said
a
prize
rounding
dungeness
in
the
afternoon
when
the
first
fierce
excitement
was
over
anthony
went
down
to
the
quay
he
did
not
particularly
wish
to
attract
attention
and
so
he
kept
himself
in
the
background
somewhat
but
he
had
a
good
view
of
her
as
she
lay
moored
just
off
the
quay
especially
when
one
of
the
town
guard
who
had
charge
of
the
ropes
that
kept
the
crowd
back
seeing
a
gentleman
in
the
crowd
beckoned
him
through
your
honour
will
wish
to
see
the
prize
he
said
in
hopes
of
a
trifle
for
himself
make
way
there
for
the
gentleman
anthony
thought
it
better
under
these
circumstances
to
accept
the
invitation
so
he
gave
the
man
something
and
slipped
through
on
the
quay
was
a
pile
of
plunder
from
the
ship
a
dozen
chests
carved
and
stood
together
barrels
of
powder
the
bell
rested
amid
a
heap
of
rich
clothes
and
hangings
a
silver
crucifix
and
a
couple
of
lamps
with
their
chains
lay
tumbled
on
one
side
and
a
parson
was
examining
a
finely
carved
mahogany
table
that
stood
near
he
looked
up
at
anthony
for
the
church
sir
he
said
cheerfully
i
shall
make
application
to
her
grace
anthony
smiled
at
him
a
holy
revenge
sir
he
said
the
ship
herself
had
once
been
a
merchantman
brig
so
much
anthony
could
tell
though
he
knew
little
of
seamanship
but
she
had
been
armed
heavily
with
deep
bulwarks
of
timber
pierced
for
a
dozen
guns
on
each
broadside
now
however
she
was
in
a
terrible
condition
the
solid
bulwarks
were
rent
and
shattered
as
indeed
was
her
whole
hull
near
the
waterline
were
nailed
sheets
of
lead
plainly
in
order
to
keep
the
water
from
entering
the
she
had
only
one
mast
and
that
was
splintered
in
more
than
one
place
a
spar
had
been
rigged
up
on
to
the
stump
of
the
bowsprit
the
high
poop
such
as
distinguished
the
spanish
vessels
was
in
the
same
deplorable
condition
as
well
as
the
which
represented
a
beardless
man
with
a
halo
behind
his
head
and
which
bore
the
marks
of
fierce
hacks
as
well
as
of
shot
anthony
read
the
name
the
juan
da
from
the
high
quay
too
he
could
see
down
on
to
the
middle
decks
and
there
was
the
most
shocking
sight
of
all
for
the
boards
and
the
and
the
bulwarks
and
the
ship
furniture
were
all
alike
splashed
with
blood
some
of
the
deeper
pools
not
even
yet
dry
it
was
evident
that
the
had
not
yielded
easily
presently
anthony
saw
an
officer
approaching
and
not
wishing
to
be
led
into
conversation
slipped
away
again
through
the
crowd
to
take
isabel
the
news
the
two
remained
quietly
upstairs
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
listening
to
the
singing
and
the
shouting
in
the
streets
and
watching
from
their
window
the
groups
that
swung
and
danced
to
and
fro
in
joy
at
contribution
to
the
defeat
of
the
invaders
when
the
dusk
fell
the
noise
was
louder
than
ever
as
the
men
began
to
drink
more
deep
and
torches
were
continually
tossing
up
and
down
the
steep
cobbled
streets
the
din
reached
its
climax
about
nine
when
the
main
body
of
the
revellers
passed
up
towards
the
inn
and
as
anthony
saw
from
the
window
finally
entered
through
the
archway
below
and
then
all
grew
tolerably
quiet
presently
isabel
said
that
she
would
go
to
bed
but
just
before
she
left
the
room
the
servant
again
came
in
if
you
please
sir
lieutenant
raxham
of
the
is
telling
the
tale
of
the
capture
of
the
spanish
ship
and
the
landlord
bid
me
come
and
tell
you
anthony
glanced
at
isabel
who
nodded
at
him
yes
go
she
said
and
come
up
and
tell
me
the
news
afterwards
if
it
is
not
very
late
when
anthony
came
downstairs
he
found
to
his
annoyance
that
the
place
of
honour
had
been
reserved
for
him
in
a
tall
chair
next
to
the
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
landlord
rose
to
meet
his
guest
sit
here
sir
he
said
i
am
glad
you
have
come
and
now
raxham
anthony
looked
about
him
with
some
dismay
at
this
extreme
publicity
the
room
was
full
from
end
to
end
they
were
chiefly
soldiers
who
sat
at
the
table
rustics
from
hawkhurst
cranbrook
and
appledore
in
brigantines
and
steel
caps
who
had
been
sent
in
by
the
magistrates
to
the
nearest
seaport
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
coast
a
few
of
them
wore
corselets
with
almain
rivets
and
carried
swords
while
the
of
the
others
rose
up
here
and
there
above
the
crowd
the
rest
of
the
room
was
filled
with
the
townsmen
of
rye
those
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence
of
the
coast
as
well
as
others
who
for
any
physical
reason
could
not
serve
by
sea
or
land
there
was
an
air
of
extraordinary
excitement
in
the
room
the
faces
of
the
most
stolid
were
transfigured
for
they
were
gathered
to
hear
of
the
struggle
their
own
dear
england
was
making
the
sickening
pause
of
those
months
of
waiting
had
ended
at
last
the
huge
southern
monster
had
risen
up
over
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
the
panting
little
country
had
flown
at
his
throat
and
grappled
him
and
now
they
were
hearing
the
tale
of
how
deep
her
fangs
had
sunk
the
crowd
laughed
and
applauded
and
drew
its
breath
sharply
as
one
man
and
the
silence
now
and
then
was
startling
as
the
young
officer
told
his
story
although
he
had
few
gifts
of
rhetoric
except
a
certain
vivid
vocabulary
he
himself
was
a
lad
of
eighteen
or
so
with
a
pleasant
reckless
face
now
flushed
with
drink
and
excitement
and
sparkling
eyes
he
was
seated
in
a
chair
upon
the
further
end
of
the
table
so
that
all
could
hear
his
story
and
he
had
a
cup
of
in
his
left
hand
as
he
talked
leaving
his
right
hand
free
to
emphasise
his
points
and
slap
his
leg
in
a
clumsy
sort
of
oratory
his
tale
was
full
of
little
similes
at
which
his
audience
nodded
their
heads
now
and
then
approvingly
he
had
apparently
already
begun
his
story
for
when
anthony
had
taken
his
seat
and
silence
had
been
obtained
he
went
straight
on
without
any
further
introduction
the
landlord
leaned
over
to
anthony
the
he
whispered
behind
his
hot
hairy
hand
and
nodded
at
him
with
meaning
eyes
and
every
time
they
fired
over
us
went
on
the
lieutenant
and
we
fired
into
them
and
the
only
damage
they
did
us
was
their
muskets
in
the
tops
they
killed
tom
dane
like
that
there
was
a
swift
hiss
of
breath
from
the
room
but
the
officer
went
straight
on
shot
him
through
the
back
as
he
bent
over
his
gun
and
wounded
old
harry
and
a
score
more
but
all
the
while
lads
we
were
at
them
with
the
broadsides
as
we
came
round
and
raking
them
with
the
in
the
poop
until
well
go
you
and
see
the
craft
as
she
lies
at
the
quay
if
you
would
know
what
we
did
i
tell
you
as
we
came
at
her
once
towards
the
end
i
saw
that
she
was
bleeding
through
her
scuppers
like
a
pig
from
the
middle
deck
they
were
all
packed
up
there
together
sailors
and
soldiers
and
a
priest
or
two
and
scarce
a
ball
could
pass
between
the
poop
and
the
forecastle
without
touching
flesh
the
lad
stopped
a
moment
and
took
a
pull
at
his
cup
and
a
murmur
of
talk
broke
out
in
the
room
anthony
was
surprised
at
his
accent
and
manner
of
speaking
and
heard
afterwards
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
parson
at
one
of
the
inland
villages
and
had
had
an
education
in
a
moment
he
went
on
well
it
would
be
about
noon
just
before
the
admiral
came
up
from
calais
that
the
old
was
lost
we
came
at
the
dons
again
as
we
had
done
before
only
closer
than
ever
and
just
as
the
captain
gave
the
word
to
put
her
about
a
ball
from
one
of
their
guns
which
they
had
trained
down
on
us
cut
old
dick
kemp
in
half
at
the
helm
and
broke
the
tiller
to
splinters
old
dick
said
a
man
voice
out
of
the
reeking
crowd
old
dick
there
was
a
murmur
round
him
bidding
him
hold
his
tongue
and
the
lad
went
on
well
we
drifted
nearer
and
nearer
there
was
nought
to
do
but
to
bang
at
them
and
that
we
did
by
god
and
to
board
her
if
we
touched
well
i
worked
my
saker
and
saw
little
else
for
the
smoke
was
like
a
black
and
the
noise
fit
to
crack
your
ears
mine
sing
yet
with
it
the
captain
was
bawling
from
the
poop
and
there
were
a
dozen
pikemen
ready
below
and
then
on
a
sudden
came
the
crash
and
i
looked
up
and
there
was
the
spaniards
decks
above
us
and
the
poop
like
a
tower
with
a
grinning
don
or
two
looking
down
and
there
was
i
looking
up
the
muzzle
of
a
culverin
i
skipped
towards
the
poop
shouting
to
the
men
and
the
dons
fired
their
broadside
as
i
god
save
us
from
that
din
but
i
knew
the
old
was
done
this
time
the
old
ship
lurched
and
shook
as
the
balls
tore
through
her
and
broke
her
back
and
there
was
such
a
yell
as
you
never
hear
this
side
of
hell
well
i
was
on
the
poop
by
now
and
the
men
after
me
for
you
see
the
poop
of
the
was
as
high
as
the
middle
deck
of
the
spaniard
and
we
must
board
from
there
or
not
at
all
well
lads
there
was
the
captain
before
me
he
had
fought
cool
till
then
as
cool
as
a
parson
among
his
roses
with
never
an
oath
from
his
mouth
but
now
he
was
as
scarlet
as
a
poppy
and
his
eyes
were
like
blue
fire
and
his
mouth
jabbered
and
foamed
he
was
so
hot
you
see
at
the
loss
of
his
ship
he
was
dancing
to
and
fro
waiting
while
the
poop
swung
round
on
the
tide
and
the
old
craft
plunged
deeper
in
every
wave
that
lifted
her
but
he
cared
no
more
for
that
nor
for
the
from
the
tops
nor
for
the
brown
grinning
devils
who
shook
their
pikes
at
him
from
the
decks
than
than
a
mad
dog
cares
for
a
shower
of
leaves
but
he
stamped
there
and
cursed
them
and
damned
them
as
they
laughed
at
him
and
then
in
a
moment
the
poop
touched
well
lads
and
the
lieutenant
set
his
cup
down
on
the
table
clapped
his
hands
on
his
knees
laughed
shortly
and
nervously
once
or
twice
and
looked
round
well
lads
i
have
never
seen
the
like
the
captain
went
for
them
like
a
wild
cat
one
step
on
the
rail
and
the
next
among
them
and
was
gone
like
a
stone
into
water
and
the
lad
clapped
his
hand
on
his
thigh
i
saw
one
face
slit
up
from
chin
to
eye
and
another
split
across
like
an
apple
and
then
we
were
after
him
the
men
were
mad
too
what
was
left
of
us
and
we
poured
up
on
to
the
decks
and
left
the
old
to
die
well
we
had
our
work
before
us
but
it
was
no
good
the
dons
could
do
nothing
i
was
after
the
captain
as
he
went
through
the
pack
and
came
out
just
behind
him
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
them
down
now
and
the
noise
and
the
foreign
oaths
went
up
like
smoke
and
the
captain
himself
was
bleeding
down
one
side
of
his
face
and
grunting
as
he
cut
and
stabbed
and
i
had
had
a
knife
through
the
arm
but
he
went
up
on
to
the
poop
and
as
i
followed
the
spaniards
broke
and
threw
down
their
arms
they
saw
was
no
use
you
see
when
we
reached
the
an
officer
in
a
blue
coat
came
forward
jabbering
some
jargon
but
the
captain
would
have
no
parley
with
him
but
flung
his
dag
clean
into
the
man
face
and
over
he
went
backwards
with
his
damned
high
heels
in
the
air
there
was
a
sudden
murmur
of
laughter
from
the
room
anthony
glanced
off
the
lieutenant
grinning
ruddy
face
for
a
moment
and
saw
the
rows
of
listening
faces
all
wrinkled
with
mirth
well
went
on
the
lad
up
went
the
captain
and
i
after
him
then
there
came
across
the
deck
very
slow
and
stately
the
spanish
captain
himself
in
a
fine
laced
coat
and
a
plumed
hat
and
he
was
holding
out
his
sword
by
the
blade
and
bowed
as
we
ran
towards
him
and
began
some
damned
foreign
nonsense
with
his
but
the
captain
would
have
none
o
that
i
tell
you
he
was
like
tom
o
bedlam
now
so
as
the
se√±or
grinned
at
him
with
his
monkey
face
and
bowed
and
wagged
the
captain
fetched
him
a
slash
across
the
cheek
with
his
sword
that
cut
up
into
his
head
and
that
don
went
spinning
across
the
poop
like
a
and
brought
up
against
the
rail
and
then
down
he
came
and
the
lad
dashed
his
hand
on
his
thigh
again
as
dead
as
mutton
again
came
a
louder
gust
of
laughter
from
the
room
anthony
half
rose
in
his
chair
and
then
sat
down
again
well
said
the
lad
and
that
was
not
all
down
he
raged
again
to
the
decks
and
i
behind
him
i
tell
you
it
was
like
a
butcher
shop
but
it
was
quieter
now
the
fighting
was
over
and
the
spaniards
were
all
run
below
except
in
the
tops
looking
down
like
young
rooks
at
an
archer
there
had
been
a
popish
priest
too
with
his
crucifix
in
one
hand
and
his
in
the
other
over
a
dying
man
as
we
came
up
but
as
we
came
down
there
he
lay
in
his
black
gown
with
a
hole
through
his
heart
and
his
crucifix
gone
one
of
the
lads
had
got
it
no
doubt
well
the
captain
brought
up
at
the
main
mast
blood
he
bawled
are
the
brown
devils
got
to
some
one
told
him
and
pointed
down
the
hatch
well
then
i
turned
sick
with
my
wound
and
the
smell
of
the
place
and
all
and
i
knew
nothing
more
till
i
found
myself
sitting
on
a
dead
don
with
the
captain
holding
me
up
and
pouring
a
cordial
down
my
throat
then
talk
and
laughter
broke
out
in
the
audience
but
the
landlord
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
what
of
the
others
he
shouted
dead
meat
too
said
the
lad
the
captain
went
down
with
a
dozen
or
more
and
hunted
them
out
and
finished
them
there
was
one
dick
told
me
afterwards
and
the
lieutenant
gave
a
cackle
of
mirth
that
they
hunted
twice
round
the
ship
before
he
jumped
over
yelling
to
some
popish
saint
to
help
him
but
it
seems
he
was
deaf
like
the
old
baal
that
parson
tells
of
o
sundays
the
dirty
swine
to
run
like
that
well
he
got
his
bellyful
now
of
the
salt
water
that
he
came
so
far
to
see
and
then
the
captain
with
his
own
hands
trained
a
robinet
that
was
on
the
poop
on
to
the
tops
and
down
the
birds
came
one
by
one
for
their
powder
up
there
was
all
shot
off
and
the
said
the
landlord
again
there
fell
a
dead
silence
all
in
the
room
knew
that
the
ship
was
lost
but
it
was
terrible
to
hear
it
again
the
lad
face
broke
into
lines
of
grief
and
he
spoke
huskily
gone
down
with
the
dead
and
wounded
and
the
rest
of
the
fleet
a
mile
away
then
the
lieutenant
went
on
to
describe
how
he
himself
had
been
deputed
to
bring
the
into
port
with
the
wounded
on
board
while
the
captain
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
by
drake
orders
attached
themselves
to
various
vessels
that
were
and
how
the
english
fleet
had
followed
what
was
left
of
the
spaniards
when
the
fight
ended
at
sunset
up
towards
the
north
sea
when
he
finished
his
story
there
was
a
tremendous
outburst
of
cheering
and
hammering
upon
the
table
and
the
feet
and
the
thundered
on
the
floor
and
a
name
was
cried
again
and
again
as
the
cups
were
emptied
god
save
her
grace
and
old
england
yelled
a
slim
archer
from
appledore
god
send
the
dons
and
all
her
foes
to
hell
roared
a
burly
pikeman
with
his
cup
in
the
air
then
the
room
shook
again
as
the
toasts
were
drunk
with
applauding
feet
and
hands
anthony
turned
to
the
landlord
who
had
just
ceased
thumping
with
his
great
red
fists
on
the
table
what
was
the
captain
name
he
asked
when
a
slight
lull
came
maxwell
said
the
man
hubert
maxwell
one
of
own
men
when
anthony
came
upstairs
he
heard
his
name
called
through
the
door
and
went
in
to
isabel
room
to
find
her
sitting
up
in
bed
in
the
gloom
of
the
summer
night
the
party
below
had
broken
up
and
all
was
quiet
except
for
the
shouts
and
hoots
of
cheerful
laughter
from
the
dispersing
groups
down
among
the
narrow
streets
well
she
said
as
he
came
in
and
stood
in
the
doorway
it
is
just
the
story
of
the
prize
he
said
and
it
seems
that
hubert
had
the
taking
of
it
there
was
silence
a
moment
anthony
could
see
her
face
a
motionless
pale
outline
and
her
arms
clasped
round
her
knees
as
she
sat
up
in
bed
hubert
she
asked
in
an
even
voice
yes
hubert
there
was
silence
a
moment
well
she
said
again
he
is
safe
said
anthony
and
fought
gallantly
i
will
tell
you
more
ah
said
isabel
softly
and
then
lay
down
again
anthony
but
anthony
dared
not
tell
her
the
details
next
day
after
all
there
was
still
a
difficulty
about
the
horses
they
had
not
arrived
until
the
wednesday
morning
and
were
greatly
exhausted
by
a
long
and
troublesome
journey
so
the
travellers
consented
to
postpone
their
journey
for
yet
one
more
day
the
weather
which
had
been
thickening
grew
heavier
still
in
the
afternoon
and
great
banks
of
clouds
were
rising
out
of
the
west
anthony
started
out
about
four
for
a
walk
along
the
coast
and
making
a
long
round
in
the
direction
of
lydd
did
not
finally
return
until
about
seven
as
he
came
in
at
the
of
the
town
he
noticed
how
empty
the
streets
were
and
passed
on
down
in
the
direction
of
the
quay
as
he
turned
down
the
steep
street
into
the
harbour
groups
began
to
pour
up
past
him
laughing
and
exclaiming
and
in
a
moment
more
came
isabel
walking
alone
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
for
he
saw
something
had
happened
her
quiet
face
was
lit
up
with
some
interior
emotion
and
her
mouth
was
trembling
the
armada
is
routed
she
said
and
i
have
seen
hubert
the
two
turned
back
together
and
walked
silently
up
to
the
inn
there
she
told
him
the
story
she
had
been
told
that
captain
maxwell
was
come
in
the
for
provisions
for
lord
howard
seymour
squadron
to
which
his
new
command
was
attached
and
that
he
was
even
now
in
harbour
at
that
she
had
gone
straight
down
alone
oh
anthony
she
cried
you
know
how
it
is
with
me
i
could
not
help
it
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
god
almighty
knows
all
and
is
not
wrath
with
me
so
i
went
down
and
was
in
the
crowd
as
he
came
down
again
with
the
mayor
hamon
we
all
made
way
for
them
and
the
men
cheered
themselves
scarlet
but
he
came
down
cool
and
quiet
you
know
his
way
with
his
eyes
half
shut
and
and
he
was
so
brown
and
he
looks
sad
and
he
had
a
great
plaister
on
the
left
temple
and
then
he
saw
me
isabel
sprang
up
and
came
up
to
anthony
and
took
his
hands
oh
anthony
i
was
very
happy
then
because
he
took
off
his
cap
and
bowed
and
his
face
was
all
lighted
and
he
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
and
then
made
hamon
known
to
me
the
crowd
laughed
and
said
things
but
i
did
not
care
and
he
soon
silenced
them
he
looked
round
so
fiercely
and
then
i
went
on
board
with
him
he
would
have
it
so
and
he
showed
us
everything
and
we
sat
a
little
in
the
cabin
and
he
told
me
of
his
wife
and
child
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
plymouth
minister
he
knew
her
when
he
was
with
drake
and
he
told
me
all
about
her
so
you
see
isabel
broke
off
and
sat
down
in
the
high
window
seat
and
then
he
asked
me
about
you
and
i
said
you
were
here
and
that
we
were
going
to
stay
a
little
while
with
buxton
of
stanfield
you
see
i
knew
we
could
trust
him
and
hamon
was
in
the
passage
just
then
looking
at
the
guns
and
then
a
sailor
came
in
to
say
that
all
was
ready
and
so
we
came
away
but
it
was
so
good
to
see
him
again
and
to
know
that
he
was
so
happy
anthony
looked
at
his
sister
in
astonishment
her
quiet
manner
was
gone
and
she
was
talking
again
almost
like
an
excited
child
and
so
happily
it
was
very
strange
he
thought
he
sat
down
beside
her
oh
anthony
she
said
do
you
understand
i
love
him
dearly
still
and
his
wife
and
child
too
god
bless
them
all
and
keep
them
the
mystery
was
still
deep
to
him
and
he
feared
to
say
what
he
should
not
so
he
kissed
isabel
silently
and
the
two
sat
there
together
and
looked
out
over
the
crowding
red
roofs
to
the
glowing
western
sky
across
the
bay
below
them
chapter
iii
it
was
a
stormy
summer
evening
as
the
brother
and
sister
rode
up
between
the
last
long
hills
that
led
to
great
keynes
a
wind
had
been
rising
all
day
that
same
wind
that
was
now
driving
the
ruined
armada
up
into
the
fierce
north
sea
with
the
fiercer
men
behind
to
bar
the
return
but
here
twenty
miles
inland
with
the
high
to
break
the
gale
the
riders
were
in
comparative
quiet
though
the
great
trees
overhead
tossed
their
heavy
rustling
heads
as
the
gusts
struck
them
now
and
again
the
party
had
turned
off
as
the
dusk
was
falling
from
the
into
that
they
knew
well
and
were
now
approaching
the
village
through
the
water
meadows
on
the
side
along
a
ride
that
would
bring
them
round
the
village
direct
to
the
dower
house
in
the
gloom
anthony
could
make
out
the
tall
reeds
and
the
loosestrife
and
willowherb
against
them
that
marked
the
course
of
the
stream
where
he
had
caught
trout
as
a
boy
and
against
the
western
sky
as
he
turned
in
his
saddle
rose
up
the
high
windy
hills
where
he
had
hawked
with
hubert
so
many
years
before
it
was
a
strange
thought
to
him
as
he
rode
along
that
his
very
presence
here
in
his
own
country
was
an
act
of
high
treason
by
the
law
lately
passed
and
that
every
day
he
lived
here
must
be
a
day
of
danger
for
isabel
too
it
was
strange
to
be
riding
up
again
towards
the
battlefield
of
her
desires
that
battlefield
where
she
had
lived
for
years
in
such
childish
faith
and
peace
without
a
suspicion
of
the
forces
that
were
lurking
beneath
her
own
quiet
nature
but
to
both
of
them
the
sense
of
was
stronger
than
all
else
that
strange
passion
for
a
particular
set
of
inanimate
things
or
at
the
most
for
an
association
of
ideas
that
has
no
parallel
in
human
emotions
and
as
they
rode
up
the
darkening
valley
and
the
lights
of
the
high
windows
of
the
hall
began
to
show
over
the
trees
on
their
right
anthony
forgot
his
treason
and
isabel
her
conflicts
and
both
felt
a
lump
rise
in
the
throat
and
their
hearts
begin
to
beat
quicker
with
a
strange
pleasurable
pulse
and
to
eyes
at
least
there
rose
up
great
tears
of
happiness
and
content
neither
dared
speak
but
both
looked
eagerly
about
at
the
pool
where
the
mayflies
used
to
dance
at
the
knoll
where
the
pigeons
nested
at
the
little
low
bridge
beneath
which
their
boats
used
to
slide
sideways
into
darkness
and
the
broad
marshy
flats
where
the
gorgeous
irises
grew
how
the
trees
have
grown
said
anthony
at
last
with
an
effort
i
can
not
see
the
lights
from
the
house
carroll
will
have
made
ready
the
rooms
then
on
the
south
i
am
sorry
they
are
not
our
own
said
anthony
ah
look
there
is
the
dovecote
cried
isabel
they
were
passing
up
now
behind
the
farm
buildings
and
directly
afterwards
came
round
in
front
of
the
little
walled
garden
to
the
west
of
the
house
there
was
a
sudden
exclamation
from
anthony
and
isabel
stared
in
silent
dismay
the
old
house
rose
up
before
them
with
its
rows
of
square
windows
against
the
night
sky
dark
there
was
not
a
glimmer
anywhere
even
carroll
own
room
on
the
south
was
dark
they
reined
their
horses
in
and
stood
a
moment
oh
anthony
anthony
cried
isabel
suddenly
what
is
it
is
there
no
one
there
anthony
shook
his
head
and
then
put
his
tired
beast
to
a
shambling
trot
with
isabel
silent
again
with
weariness
and
disappointment
behind
him
they
passed
along
outside
the
low
wall
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
drew
up
at
the
odd
little
doorway
in
the
angle
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
servants
had
drawn
up
behind
them
and
now
pressed
up
to
hold
their
horses
and
the
brother
and
sister
slipped
off
and
went
towards
the
door
anthony
passed
under
the
little
open
porch
and
put
his
hand
out
to
the
door
it
was
quite
dark
underneath
the
porch
and
he
felt
further
and
further
and
yet
there
was
no
door
his
foot
struck
the
step
he
felt
his
way
to
the
doorposts
and
groped
for
the
door
but
still
there
was
none
he
could
feel
the
panelling
of
the
lobby
inside
the
doorway
and
that
was
all
he
drew
back
as
one
would
draw
back
from
a
dead
face
on
which
one
had
laid
a
hand
in
the
dark
oh
anthony
said
isabel
again
what
is
it
she
was
still
outside
have
you
a
light
said
anthony
hoarsely
to
the
servants
the
man
nearest
him
bent
and
fumbled
in
the
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
while
kindled
a
little
bent
taper
and
handed
it
to
him
as
he
went
towards
the
porch
shading
it
with
his
hand
isabel
sprang
past
him
and
went
before
and
then
as
the
light
fell
through
the
doorway
stopped
in
dead
and
bewildered
silence
the
door
was
lying
on
the
floor
within
shattered
and
splintered
anthony
stepped
beside
her
and
she
turned
and
clung
to
his
arm
and
a
sob
or
two
made
itself
heard
then
they
looked
about
them
the
banisters
above
them
were
smashed
and
like
a
cataract
down
the
stairs
lay
a
confused
heap
of
crockery
torn
embroidery
and
clothes
books
and
broken
furniture
anthony
hand
shook
so
much
that
the
shadows
of
the
broken
banisters
waved
on
the
wall
above
like
thin
exulting
dancers
suddenly
anthony
started
carroll
he
exclaimed
and
he
darted
upstairs
past
the
ruins
into
her
two
rooms
halfway
up
the
flight
and
in
a
minute
or
two
was
back
with
isabel
she
has
escaped
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
then
the
two
stood
looking
about
them
silently
again
the
door
leading
to
the
cellars
on
the
left
was
broken
too
and
fragments
of
casks
and
bottles
lay
about
the
steps
the
white
wall
was
splashed
with
drink
and
there
was
a
smell
of
spirits
in
the
air
evidently
the
stormers
had
thought
themselves
worthy
of
their
hire
come
he
said
again
and
leaving
the
entrance
lobby
the
two
passed
to
the
and
pushed
that
open
and
looked
there
was
the
same
furious
confusion
there
the
tapestry
was
lying
tumbled
and
rent
on
the
floor
the
high
oak
mantelpiece
was
shattered
and
doleful
cracks
and
splinters
in
the
panelling
all
round
showed
how
mad
the
attack
had
been
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
further
archway
was
broken
clean
off
and
the
brickwork
showed
behind
the
pictures
had
been
smashed
and
added
to
the
heap
of
wrecked
furniture
and
broken
glass
in
the
middle
come
he
said
once
more
and
the
two
passed
silently
through
the
broken
archway
and
going
up
the
other
flight
of
stairs
gradually
made
the
round
of
the
house
everywhere
it
was
the
same
except
in
the
attics
where
apparently
the
mob
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
go
isabel
own
room
was
the
most
pitiable
of
all
the
windows
had
only
the
leaden
frames
left
and
those
bent
and
battered
the
delicate
panelling
was
scarred
and
split
by
the
shower
of
stones
that
had
poured
in
through
the
window
and
that
now
lay
in
all
parts
of
the
room
a
painting
of
her
mother
that
had
hung
over
her
bed
was
now
lying
face
downwards
on
the
floor
isabel
turned
it
over
silently
a
stone
had
gone
through
the
face
and
it
had
been
apparently
slit
too
by
some
sharp
instrument
even
the
slender
oak
bed
was
smashed
in
the
centre
as
if
half
a
dozen
men
had
jumped
upon
it
at
once
and
the
little
near
the
window
had
been
deliberately
hacked
in
half
isabel
looked
at
it
all
with
wide
startled
eyes
and
parted
lips
and
then
suddenly
sank
down
on
the
wrecked
bed
where
she
had
hoped
to
sleep
that
night
and
began
to
sob
like
a
child
ah
i
did
think
i
did
think
she
began
anthony
stooped
and
tried
to
lift
her
come
my
darling
he
said
is
not
this
a
high
honour
relinquit
domos
oh
why
have
they
done
it
sobbed
isabel
what
harm
have
we
done
them
and
she
began
to
wail
she
was
thoroughly
and
and
anthony
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
blame
her
but
he
spoke
again
bravely
we
are
catholics
he
said
that
is
why
they
have
done
it
do
not
throw
away
this
grace
that
our
lord
has
given
us
embrace
it
and
make
it
yours
it
was
the
priest
that
was
speaking
now
and
isabel
turned
her
face
and
looked
at
him
and
then
got
up
and
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
oh
anthony
help
me
she
said
and
so
stood
there
quiet
he
came
down
presently
to
the
servants
while
isabel
went
upstairs
to
prepare
the
rooms
in
the
attics
for
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
ride
further
that
night
so
they
settled
to
sleep
there
and
stable
the
horses
and
to
ride
on
early
the
next
day
and
be
out
of
the
village
before
the
folks
were
about
anthony
gave
directions
to
the
servants
who
were
catholics
too
and
explained
in
a
word
or
two
what
had
happened
and
bade
them
come
up
to
the
house
as
soon
as
they
had
fed
and
watered
the
beasts
meanwhile
he
took
the
indoors
and
spread
out
their
remaining
provisions
in
one
of
the
downstairs
rooms
and
soon
isabel
joined
him
i
have
made
up
five
beds
she
said
and
her
voice
and
lips
were
steady
and
her
eyes
grave
and
serene
again
the
five
supped
together
in
the
wrecked
kitchen
a
fine
room
on
the
east
of
the
house
supported
by
a
great
oak
pillar
to
which
the
horses
of
guests
were
sometimes
attached
when
the
stable
was
full
isabel
managed
to
make
a
fire
and
to
boil
some
soup
but
they
hung
thick
curtains
across
the
shattered
windows
and
quenched
the
fire
as
soon
as
the
soup
was
made
for
fear
that
either
the
light
or
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
should
arouse
attention
when
supper
was
over
and
the
two
and
isabel
french
maid
were
washing
up
in
the
scullery
isabel
suddenly
turned
to
anthony
as
they
sat
together
near
the
fireplace
i
had
forgotten
she
said
what
we
arranged
as
we
rode
up
i
must
go
and
tell
her
still
anthony
looked
at
her
steadily
a
moment
god
keep
you
he
said
she
kissed
him
and
took
her
drew
the
hood
over
her
head
and
went
out
into
the
dark
it
was
with
the
keenest
relief
that
half
an
hour
later
anthony
heard
her
footstep
again
in
the
hall
outside
the
servants
were
gone
upstairs
by
now
and
the
house
was
quiet
she
came
in
and
sat
by
him
again
and
took
his
hand
thank
god
i
went
she
said
i
have
left
her
so
happy
tell
me
all
said
anthony
i
went
through
the
garden
said
isabel
but
came
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
so
that
they
might
not
think
i
came
from
here
when
the
servant
came
to
the
door
he
was
a
stranger
and
a
protestant
no
doubt
i
said
at
once
that
i
brought
news
of
maxwell
from
rye
and
he
took
me
straight
in
and
asked
me
to
come
in
while
he
fetched
her
woman
then
her
woman
came
out
and
took
me
upstairs
up
into
lady
maxwell
old
room
and
there
she
was
lying
in
bed
under
the
great
canopy
oh
anthony
she
is
so
pretty
her
golden
hair
was
lying
out
all
over
the
pillow
and
her
face
is
so
sweet
she
cried
out
when
i
came
in
and
lifted
herself
on
her
elbow
so
i
just
said
at
once
is
safe
and
well
and
then
she
went
off
into
sobs
and
laughter
so
that
i
had
to
go
and
soothe
her
her
woman
was
so
foolish
and
helpless
and
very
soon
she
was
quiet
and
then
she
called
me
her
darling
and
she
kissed
me
again
and
again
and
told
the
woman
to
go
and
leave
us
together
and
then
she
lifted
the
sheet
and
showed
me
the
face
of
a
little
child
oh
anthony
hubert
child
and
hers
the
second
born
on
tuesday
only
think
of
that
i
was
going
to
call
her
she
said
i
had
not
heard
by
but
now
i
shall
call
her
victory
anthony
looked
quickly
at
his
sister
with
a
faint
smile
in
his
eyes
and
what
did
you
say
he
asked
isabel
smiled
outright
but
her
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
too
have
guessed
she
said
i
said
her
mercy
all
the
same
and
she
kissed
me
again
and
cried
and
said
that
she
would
and
then
i
told
her
all
about
hubert
and
about
his
little
wound
and
how
well
he
looked
and
how
all
the
fighting
was
most
likely
over
and
what
his
cabin
looked
like
and
then
she
suddenly
guessed
who
i
was
and
asked
me
and
i
could
not
deny
it
you
know
but
she
promised
not
to
tell
then
she
told
me
all
about
the
house
here
and
how
she
was
afraid
hubert
had
said
something
impatient
about
people
who
go
to
foreign
parts
and
leave
their
country
to
be
attacked
you
know
he
did
not
really
mean
it
she
said
and
of
course
he
did
not
well
the
people
had
remembered
that
and
it
spread
and
spread
and
when
the
news
of
the
armada
came
last
week
a
mob
came
over
from
east
grinsted
and
they
sat
drinking
and
drinking
in
the
village
and
of
course
grace
could
not
go
out
to
them
and
all
the
old
people
are
gone
and
the
catholics
on
the
estate
and
so
at
last
they
all
came
out
roaring
and
shouting
down
the
drive
and
carroll
was
warned
and
slipped
out
to
the
hall
and
she
is
now
gone
to
stanfield
to
wait
for
us
and
then
the
crowd
broke
into
the
house
but
oh
anthony
grace
was
so
sorry
and
cried
sore
to
think
of
us
here
and
asked
us
to
come
and
stay
there
but
of
course
i
told
her
we
could
not
and
then
i
said
a
prayer
for
her
and
we
kissed
one
another
again
and
then
i
came
away
anthony
looked
at
his
sister
and
there
was
honour
and
pride
of
her
in
his
eyes
the
ride
to
stanfield
next
day
was
a
long
affair
at
a
all
the
way
the
horses
were
thoroughly
tired
with
their
journey
and
they
were
obliged
to
start
soon
after
three
in
the
morning
after
a
very
insufficient
rest
they
did
not
reach
groombridge
till
nearly
ten
when
they
dined
and
then
rode
on
towards
tonbridge
about
noon
there
were
heavy
hearts
to
be
carried
as
well
the
attempt
to
welcome
the
misery
of
their
was
a
bitter
effort
all
the
more
bitter
for
that
it
was
an
entirely
unexpected
call
upon
them
during
those
six
years
abroad
probably
not
a
day
had
passed
without
visions
of
great
keynes
and
the
pleasant
and
familiar
rooms
and
garden
of
their
own
house
and
mental
rehearsals
of
their
return
the
shock
of
the
night
before
too
had
been
emphasised
by
the
horror
of
the
cold
morning
light
creeping
through
the
empty
windows
on
to
the
cruel
heaps
within
the
garden
too
seen
in
the
dim
morning
with
its
trampled
lawns
and
wrecked
heaped
with
withered
sunflowers
and
all
the
rich
august
growth
with
the
earthen
smashed
the
stone
balls
on
the
gate
overturned
and
the
laurels
at
the
corner
uprooted
all
this
was
a
horrible
pain
to
isabel
to
whom
the
garden
was
very
near
as
dear
and
familiar
as
her
own
room
so
it
was
a
silent
and
sorrowful
ride
and
anthony
heart
rose
in
relief
as
at
last
up
the
grey
he
saw
the
crowded
roofs
of
stanfield
place
rise
over
the
churchyard
wall
their
welcome
from
buxton
went
far
to
compensate
for
all
my
dear
boy
he
said
or
my
dear
father
as
i
should
call
you
in
private
you
do
not
know
what
happiness
is
mine
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
a
priest
again
but
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
it
is
a
greater
to
have
my
friend
and
what
a
sister
you
have
upstairs
they
were
in
buxton
own
little
room
on
the
and
isabel
had
gone
to
rest
until
supper
anthony
told
him
of
the
grim
surprise
that
had
awaited
them
at
great
keynes
so
you
must
forgive
my
sister
if
she
is
a
little
sad
yes
yes
said
buxton
i
had
heard
from
carroll
last
night
when
she
arrived
here
but
there
was
no
time
to
warn
you
i
had
expected
you
though
carroll
did
not
anthony
had
sent
a
man
straight
from
rye
to
stanfield
but
mistress
isabel
as
i
shall
venture
to
call
her
must
do
what
she
can
with
this
house
and
garden
i
need
not
say
how
wholly
it
is
hers
and
i
shall
call
you
anthony
he
added
in
public
at
least
and
for
strangers
you
are
just
here
as
my
guest
and
you
shall
be
called
capell
a
sound
name
and
you
shall
be
catholics
too
though
you
are
no
priest
of
course
in
public
and
you
have
returned
from
the
continent
i
hold
it
is
no
use
to
lie
when
you
can
be
found
out
i
do
not
know
what
your
conscience
is
father
anthony
but
for
myself
i
count
us
catholics
to
be
statu
now
and
therefore
i
shall
lie
frankly
and
fully
when
there
is
need
and
you
may
do
as
you
please
old
blake
used
to
bid
me
prevaricate
instead
but
that
always
seemed
to
me
two
lies
instead
of
one
one
to
the
questioning
party
and
the
other
to
myself
and
so
i
always
said
to
him
but
he
would
not
have
it
so
i
wondered
he
did
not
tell
me
that
two
negatives
made
an
affirmative
but
he
was
not
clever
enough
the
good
father
so
my
own
custom
is
to
tell
one
plain
lie
when
needed
and
shame
the
devil
it
was
pleasant
to
anthony
to
hear
his
friend
talk
again
and
he
said
so
his
host
face
softened
into
a
great
tenderness
dear
lad
i
know
what
you
mean
please
god
you
may
find
this
a
happy
home
a
couple
of
hours
later
when
anthony
and
isabel
came
down
together
from
their
rooms
in
the
old
wing
they
found
buxton
in
his
black
satin
and
lace
in
the
beautiful
on
the
it
was
already
past
the
but
their
host
showed
no
signs
of
going
into
the
hall
at
last
he
apologised
i
ask
your
pardon
mistress
isabel
but
i
have
a
guest
come
to
stay
with
me
who
only
arrived
an
hour
ago
and
she
is
a
great
lady
and
must
have
her
time
ah
here
she
is
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
radiant
vision
appeared
the
door
was
a
little
way
off
and
there
were
no
candles
near
it
but
there
swelled
and
rustled
into
the
room
a
figure
all
in
blue
and
gold
with
a
white
delicate
ruff
and
diamond
buckles
shone
beneath
the
rich
brocaded
petticoat
above
rose
a
white
bosom
and
throat
scintillating
with
diamonds
and
a
flushed
face
with
scarlet
lips
all
crowned
by
piles
of
black
hair
with
black
dancing
eyes
beneath
still
a
little
in
the
shadow
this
splendid
figure
swept
down
with
a
great
curtsey
which
isabel
met
by
another
while
the
two
gentlemen
bowed
low
and
then
as
the
stranger
swayed
up
again
into
the
full
light
of
the
sconces
anthony
recognised
mary
corbet
he
stood
irresolute
with
happy
hesitation
and
she
came
up
smiling
brilliantly
and
before
he
could
stay
her
dropped
down
on
one
knee
and
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
just
as
the
man
left
the
room
god
bless
you
father
anthony
she
said
and
as
he
looked
at
her
as
she
glanced
up
he
could
not
tell
whether
her
eyes
shone
with
tears
or
laughter
this
is
very
charming
and
proper
mistress
corbet
and
like
a
true
daughter
of
the
church
put
in
buxton
but
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
not
in
future
kiss
priests
hands
nor
call
them
father
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
at
least
not
in
my
house
ah
she
said
you
were
always
prudent
have
you
seen
his
secret
doors
she
went
on
to
anthony
the
entire
catholic
church
might
play
hare
and
hounds
with
the
holy
father
as
huntsman
and
the
cardinals
as
the
whips
through
buxton
secret
labyrinths
wait
until
you
are
hare
and
it
is
other
than
holy
church
that
is
said
buxton
and
you
will
thank
god
for
my
labyrinths
as
you
call
them
then
she
greeted
isabel
with
great
warmth
why
my
dear
she
said
you
are
not
the
little
puritan
maiden
any
longer
we
must
have
a
long
talk
and
you
shall
tell
me
everything
mistress
mary
is
not
so
greatly
changed
said
isabel
smiling
she
always
would
be
told
everything
it
was
strange
to
anthony
to
meet
mary
again
after
so
long
and
to
find
her
so
little
changed
as
isabel
had
said
truly
he
himself
had
passed
through
so
much
since
they
had
last
met
at
greenwich
over
six
years
ago
his
conversion
his
foreign
sojourn
and
above
all
the
bewildering
and
intoxicating
sweetness
of
his
ordination
and
priestly
life
and
yet
he
felt
as
close
to
mary
as
ever
knit
in
a
bond
of
wonderful
good
fellowship
and
brotherhood
such
as
he
had
never
felt
to
any
other
in
just
that
kind
and
degree
he
watched
her
warm
and
content
as
she
talked
across
the
polished
oak
and
beneath
the
gleam
of
the
candles
and
listened
charmed
by
her
air
and
her
talk
there
is
not
so
much
news
of
her
grace
she
said
save
that
she
is
turning
soldier
in
her
old
age
she
rode
out
to
tilbury
you
know
the
other
day
in
steel
cuirass
and
scarlet
out
to
see
her
dear
robin
and
the
army
and
her
royal
face
was
all
smiles
and
becks
and
lord
how
the
soldiers
cheered
but
if
you
had
seen
her
as
i
did
in
her
room
when
she
first
buckled
on
her
armour
and
the
joints
did
not
fit
yes
and
heard
her
there
were
no
smiles
to
spare
then
she
lodged
at
rich
you
know
two
nights
but
he
would
be
poor
i
should
suppose
by
the
time
her
grace
left
him
for
he
will
not
see
the
worth
of
a
shoelace
again
of
all
that
he
expended
on
her
you
see
remarked
buxton
to
isabel
how
fortunate
we
are
in
having
such
a
friend
of
her
grace
with
us
we
hear
all
the
cream
of
the
news
even
though
it
be
a
trifle
sour
sometimes
a
lover
of
her
grace
said
mary
loves
the
truth
about
her
however
bitter
but
then
i
have
no
secret
passages
where
i
may
hide
from
my
sovereign
the
cream
can
scarce
be
but
sour
said
anthony
near
her
grace
there
is
so
much
thunder
in
the
air
yes
but
the
sun
came
out
when
you
were
there
anthony
put
in
isabel
smiling
but
even
the
light
of
her
glorious
countenance
is
trying
said
mary
she
is
overpowering
in
thunder
and
sunshine
alike
we
have
had
enough
of
that
metaphor
observed
buxton
then
anthony
had
to
talk
and
tell
all
the
foreign
news
of
douai
and
rome
and
cardinal
allen
and
of
father
persons
scheme
for
a
college
at
valladolid
father
robert
is
a
superb
beggar
as
he
is
superb
in
all
things
said
buxton
i
dare
not
think
how
much
he
got
from
me
for
his
college
and
then
i
do
not
even
approve
of
his
college
his
principles
are
too
logical
for
me
i
have
ever
had
a
weakness
for
the
this
led
on
to
the
armada
anthony
told
his
experience
of
it
how
he
had
seen
at
least
the
sails
of
lord
howard
squadron
far
away
against
the
dawn
and
this
led
on
again
to
a
sharp
discussion
when
the
servants
had
left
the
room
i
do
not
know
said
mary
at
last
it
is
difficult
is
not
the
choice
between
god
and
elizabeth
if
i
were
a
man
why
should
i
not
take
up
arms
to
defend
my
religion
since
i
am
a
woman
why
should
i
not
pray
for
philip
success
it
is
a
bitter
hard
choice
i
know
but
why
need
i
prefer
my
country
to
my
faith
tell
me
that
father
anthony
i
can
only
tell
you
my
private
opinion
said
anthony
and
that
is
that
both
duties
may
be
done
as
buxton
here
used
to
tell
me
the
duty
to
c√¶sar
is
as
real
as
the
duty
to
god
a
man
is
bound
to
both
for
each
has
its
proper
bounds
when
either
oversteps
them
it
must
be
resisted
when
elizabeth
bids
me
deny
my
faith
i
tell
her
i
would
sooner
die
when
a
priest
bids
me
deny
my
country
i
tell
him
i
would
sooner
be
damned
mary
clapped
her
hands
i
like
to
hear
a
man
talk
like
that
she
cried
but
what
of
the
holy
father
and
his
excommunication
of
her
grace
anthony
looked
up
at
her
sharply
and
then
smiled
isabel
watched
him
with
a
troubled
face
aquinas
holds
he
said
that
an
excommunication
of
sovereign
and
people
in
a
lump
is
invalid
and
until
the
holy
father
tells
me
himself
that
aquinas
is
wrong
i
shall
continue
to
think
he
is
right
burst
in
buxton
what
a
leave
it
alone
until
the
choice
must
be
made
and
meanwhile
say
your
prayers
for
pope
and
queen
too
and
hear
mass
and
tell
your
beads
and
hold
your
tongue
that
is
what
i
say
to
myself
mistress
mary
i
will
not
have
my
chaplain
heckled
here
is
his
lady
sister
all
between
heresy
and
treason
they
sat
long
over
the
talking
over
the
last
six
years
and
the
times
generally
more
than
once
mary
showed
a
strange
bitterness
against
the
queen
at
last
buxton
showed
his
astonishment
plainly
i
do
not
understand
you
he
said
i
know
that
at
heart
you
are
loyal
and
yet
one
might
say
you
meditated
her
murder
mary
face
grew
white
with
passion
and
her
eyes
blazed
ah
she
hissed
you
do
not
understand
you
say
then
where
is
your
heart
but
then
you
did
not
see
mary
stuart
die
anthony
looked
at
her
amazed
and
you
did
mistress
mary
he
asked
mary
bowed
with
her
lips
set
tight
to
check
their
trembling
i
will
tell
you
she
said
if
our
host
permits
and
she
glanced
at
him
then
come
this
way
he
said
and
they
rose
from
table
they
went
back
again
to
the
a
little
had
been
kindled
under
the
wide
chimney
and
the
room
was
full
of
dancing
shadows
the
great
the
roses
the
crowns
and
the
portcullises
on
the
ceiling
seemed
to
waver
in
the
firelight
for
buxton
at
a
sign
from
mary
blew
out
the
four
tapers
that
were
burning
in
the
sconces
they
all
sat
down
in
the
chairs
that
were
set
round
the
fire
mary
in
a
tall
porter
chair
with
flaps
that
threw
a
shadow
on
her
face
when
she
leaned
back
and
she
took
a
fan
in
her
hand
to
keep
the
fire
or
her
friends
eyes
from
her
face
should
she
need
it
she
first
told
them
very
briefly
of
the
last
months
of
mary
life
of
the
web
that
was
spun
round
her
by
walsingham
tactics
and
her
own
friends
efforts
until
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
stir
hand
or
foot
without
treason
real
or
pretended
being
set
in
motion
somewhere
then
she
described
how
at
christmas
elizabeth
had
sent
her
mary
corbet
as
a
catholic
up
to
the
queen
of
the
scots
at
fotheringay
on
a
private
mission
to
attempt
to
win
the
prisoner
confidence
and
to
persuade
her
to
confess
to
having
been
privy
to
babington
conspiracy
and
how
the
scottish
queen
had
utterly
denied
it
even
in
the
most
intimate
conversations
sentence
had
been
already
passed
but
the
warrant
had
not
been
signed
and
it
never
would
have
been
signed
said
mistress
corbet
if
mary
had
owned
to
the
crime
of
which
she
was
accused
ah
how
they
insulted
her
cried
mary
corbet
indignantly
she
showed
me
one
day
the
room
where
her
throne
had
stood
now
the
cloth
of
state
had
been
torn
down
by
sir
amyas
paulet
men
and
he
himself
dared
to
sit
with
his
hat
on
his
head
in
the
sovereign
presence
the
insolence
of
the
hound
but
the
queen
showed
me
how
she
had
hung
a
crucifix
where
her
royal
arms
used
to
hang
she
said
to
me
la
reine
au
roi
des
rois
mistress
corbet
went
on
to
tell
of
the
arrival
of
beale
with
the
on
that
february
sunday
evening
i
saw
his
foxy
face
look
sideways
up
at
the
windows
as
he
got
off
his
horse
in
the
courtyard
and
i
knew
that
our
foes
had
triumphed
then
the
other
bloodhounds
began
to
arrive
my
lord
of
kent
on
the
monday
and
shrewsbury
on
the
tuesday
then
they
came
in
to
us
after
dinner
and
they
told
her
grace
it
was
to
be
for
next
day
i
was
behind
her
chair
and
saw
her
hand
on
the
boss
of
the
arm
and
it
did
not
stir
nor
clench
she
said
it
could
not
be
she
could
not
believe
it
of
elizabeth
when
she
did
at
last
believe
it
there
was
no
wild
weeping
or
crying
for
mercy
but
she
set
her
affairs
in
order
queenly
and
yet
sedately
too
she
first
thought
of
her
soul
and
desired
that
de
preau
might
come
to
her
and
hear
her
confession
but
they
would
not
permit
it
they
offered
her
fletcher
instead
godly
man
as
my
lord
of
kent
called
him
ne
doute
pas
she
said
smiling
but
it
was
hard
not
to
have
a
priest
then
she
set
her
earthly
affairs
in
order
when
she
had
examined
her
soul
and
made
confession
to
god
without
the
dean
assistance
we
all
supped
together
when
it
was
growing
late
and
i
thought
father
anthony
indeed
i
did
of
another
supper
long
ago
then
gorion
was
sent
for
to
arrange
some
messages
and
gifts
and
until
two
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
we
watched
with
her
or
served
her
as
she
wrote
and
gave
orders
the
court
outside
was
full
of
comings
and
goings
as
i
passed
down
the
passage
i
saw
the
torches
of
the
visitors
that
were
come
to
see
the
end
and
once
i
heard
a
hammering
from
the
great
hall
then
she
went
to
her
bed
and
i
think
few
lay
as
quiet
as
she
in
the
castle
that
night
i
was
with
her
ladies
when
they
waked
her
before
dawn
and
it
was
hard
to
see
that
sweet
face
on
the
pillow
open
its
eyes
again
to
what
was
before
her
then
when
she
was
dressed
i
went
in
again
and
we
all
went
to
the
oratory
where
she
received
our
saviour
from
the
golden
pyx
which
the
holy
father
had
sent
her
for
you
see
they
would
allow
no
priest
to
come
near
her
presently
the
gentlemen
knocked
when
we
tried
to
follow
we
were
prevented
they
wished
her
to
die
alone
among
her
enemies
but
at
last
two
of
the
ladies
were
allowed
to
go
with
her
i
ran
out
another
way
and
sent
a
message
to
my
lord
shrewsbury
who
knew
me
at
court
as
i
waited
in
the
courtyard
the
musicians
there
were
playing
witches
dirge
as
is
done
at
the
burnings
and
all
to
mock
at
my
queen
at
last
a
halberdier
was
sent
to
bring
me
in
mary
corbet
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
the
others
dared
not
speak
the
strange
emotion
of
her
voice
and
the
stillness
of
that
sparkling
figure
in
the
porter
chair
affected
them
profoundly
her
face
was
now
completely
shaded
by
a
fan
it
was
in
the
hall
where
a
great
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
the
stage
stood
at
the
upper
end
all
was
black
the
crowd
of
gentlemen
filled
the
hall
and
all
were
still
and
reverent
except
except
a
devil
who
laughed
as
my
queen
came
in
all
in
black
she
was
smiling
and
brave
and
went
up
the
steps
and
sat
on
her
black
throne
and
looked
about
her
the
the
were
just
in
front
of
her
then
the
warrant
was
read
by
beale
and
i
saw
the
lords
glance
at
her
as
it
ended
but
there
was
nought
but
joyous
hope
in
her
face
she
looked
now
and
again
gently
on
the
ivory
crucifix
in
her
hand
as
she
listened
and
her
lips
moved
to
to
him
who
was
delivered
to
death
for
her
mary
corbet
gave
one
quick
sob
and
was
silent
again
for
an
instant
then
she
went
on
in
a
yet
lower
voice
fletcher
tried
to
address
her
but
he
stammered
and
paused
three
or
four
times
and
the
queen
smiled
on
him
and
bade
him
not
trouble
himself
for
that
she
lived
and
died
a
catholic
but
they
would
not
let
her
be
so
she
looked
on
her
crucifix
and
was
silent
and
even
then
my
lord
of
kent
badgered
her
and
told
her
christ
crucified
in
her
hand
would
not
save
her
except
he
was
engraved
on
her
heart
then
she
knelt
at
her
chair
and
tried
to
pray
softly
to
herself
but
fletcher
would
not
have
that
and
prayed
himself
aloud
and
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
hall
began
to
pray
aloud
with
him
but
mary
prayed
on
in
latin
and
english
aloud
and
prevailed
for
all
were
silent
at
the
end
but
she
and
at
last
she
kissed
the
crucifix
and
cried
in
a
sweet
piercing
voice
thine
arms
o
jesus
were
spread
upon
the
cross
so
receive
me
into
thy
mercy
and
forgive
me
my
sins
again
mistress
corbet
was
silent
and
anthony
drew
a
long
sobbing
breath
of
pure
pity
and
isabel
was
crying
quietly
to
herself
when
the
headsmen
offered
to
assist
her
went
on
the
low
voice
the
queen
smiled
at
the
gentlemen
and
said
that
she
had
never
had
such
grooms
before
and
then
they
let
the
ladies
come
up
when
they
began
to
help
her
with
her
dress
i
covered
my
face
i
could
not
help
it
there
was
such
a
stillness
now
that
i
could
hear
her
beads
chink
at
her
girdle
when
i
looked
again
she
was
ready
with
her
sweet
neck
uncovered
all
round
her
was
black
but
the
headsman
who
wore
a
white
apron
over
his
velvet
and
she
in
her
beauty
and
oh
her
face
was
so
fair
and
delicate
and
her
eyes
so
tender
and
joyous
and
as
her
ladies
looked
at
her
they
sobbed
piteously
criez
vous
said
she
then
she
knelt
down
and
mistress
mowbray
bound
her
eyes
she
smiled
again
under
the
handkerchief
she
said
and
then
revoir
then
she
said
once
more
a
latin
psalm
and
then
laid
her
head
down
as
on
a
pillow
manus
tuas
domine
she
said
mary
corbet
stopped
and
leaned
forward
a
little
putting
her
hand
into
her
bosom
anthony
looked
at
her
as
she
drew
up
a
thin
silk
cord
with
a
ruby
ring
attached
to
it
this
was
hers
she
said
simply
and
held
it
out
each
of
the
catholics
took
it
and
kissed
it
reverently
and
mary
replaced
it
when
they
lifted
her
she
added
a
little
dog
sprang
out
from
her
clothes
and
yelped
and
at
that
the
man
near
me
who
had
laughed
as
she
came
in
wept
then
the
four
sat
silent
in
the
firelight
chapter
iv
stanfield
place
life
at
stanfield
place
was
wonderfully
sweet
to
anthony
and
isabel
after
their
exile
abroad
for
both
of
them
had
an
intense
love
of
england
and
of
english
ways
the
very
sight
of
children
and
the
noise
of
their
shrill
familiar
voices
from
the
village
street
the
depths
of
the
august
woods
round
them
the
english
manners
of
living
all
this
was
alive
with
a
full
deliberate
joy
to
these
two
besides
there
was
the
unfailing
tenderness
and
gaiety
of
buxton
and
at
first
there
was
the
pleasant
company
of
mary
corbet
as
well
there
was
little
or
no
anxiety
resting
on
any
of
them
god
was
served
as
the
celebration
of
mass
was
called
each
morning
in
the
little
room
where
anthony
had
made
the
exercises
and
the
three
others
were
always
present
it
was
seldom
that
the
room
was
not
filled
to
on
sundays
and
with
the
household
and
the
neighbouring
catholics
everything
was
of
course
perfection
in
the
little
chapel
when
it
was
furnished
as
was
all
that
buxton
possessed
there
was
a
wonderful
golden
crucifix
by
an
unknown
artist
that
he
had
picked
up
in
his
travels
that
stood
upon
the
altar
with
the
of
the
saviour
at
each
of
the
four
ends
a
pelican
at
the
top
an
eagle
on
the
right
supporting
its
young
which
were
raising
their
wings
for
a
flight
on
the
left
a
phoenix
amid
flames
and
at
the
foot
a
hen
gathering
her
chickens
under
her
wings
all
the
birds
had
tiny
emerald
eyes
the
figure
on
the
cross
was
beautifully
wrought
and
had
rubies
in
hands
and
feet
and
side
there
were
also
two
silver
designed
by
marrina
for
the
piccolomini
chapel
in
the
church
of
francis
in
siena
and
two
more
plainer
for
the
elevation
the
vestments
were
exquisite
those
for
high
festivals
were
cloth
of
gold
and
the
other
white
ones
were
beautifully
worked
with
seed
pearls
and
jewelled
crosses
on
the
stole
and
maniple
the
other
colours
too
were
well
represented
and
were
the
work
of
a
famous
convent
in
the
south
of
france
all
the
other
articles
too
were
of
silver
the
lavabo
basin
the
bell
the
thurible
the
boat
and
spoon
and
the
cruets
it
was
a
joy
to
all
the
catholics
who
came
to
see
the
worship
of
god
carried
on
with
such
splendour
when
in
so
many
places
even
necessaries
were
scarcely
forthcoming
there
was
a
little
between
the
chapel
and
the
priest
room
just
of
a
size
to
hold
the
altar
furniture
and
the
priests
in
case
of
a
sudden
alarm
and
there
were
several
others
in
the
house
too
which
buxton
had
showed
to
anthony
with
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
i
dared
not
show
them
to
you
the
last
time
you
were
here
he
said
and
there
was
no
need
but
now
there
must
be
no
delay
i
have
lately
made
some
more
too
now
here
is
one
he
said
stopping
before
the
great
carved
mantelpiece
in
the
hall
he
looked
round
to
see
that
no
servant
was
in
the
room
and
then
standing
on
a
settee
before
the
fire
touched
something
above
and
a
circular
hole
large
enough
for
a
man
to
clamber
through
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
tracery
there
he
said
and
you
will
find
some
cured
ham
and
a
candle
with
a
few
dates
within
should
you
ever
have
need
to
step
up
there
which
pray
god
you
may
not
what
is
the
secret
asked
anthony
as
the
tracery
swung
back
into
place
and
his
host
stepped
down
pull
the
third
roebuck
ears
in
the
coat
of
arms
or
rather
push
them
it
closes
with
a
spring
and
is
provided
with
a
bolt
but
i
do
not
recommend
that
refuge
unless
it
is
necessary
in
winter
it
is
too
hot
for
the
chimney
passes
behind
it
and
in
summer
it
is
too
oppressive
for
there
is
not
too
much
air
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
that
led
in
the
direction
of
the
little
old
rooms
where
anthony
had
slept
in
his
visit
buxton
stopped
before
the
portrait
of
a
old
gentleman
that
hung
on
the
wall
now
there
is
an
upright
old
man
you
would
say
and
indeed
he
was
for
he
was
my
own
uncle
and
made
a
godly
end
of
it
last
year
but
now
see
what
a
liar
i
have
made
of
him
buxton
put
his
hand
behind
the
frame
and
the
whole
picture
opened
like
a
door
showing
a
space
within
where
three
or
four
could
stand
anthony
stepped
inside
and
his
friend
followed
him
and
after
showing
him
some
clothes
hanging
against
the
wall
closed
the
picture
after
them
leaving
them
in
the
dark
now
see
what
a
old
fellow
he
is
too
whispered
his
host
anthony
looked
where
he
was
guided
and
perceived
two
pinholes
through
which
he
could
see
the
whole
length
of
the
corridor
through
the
centre
of
each
eye
whispered
his
friend
is
he
not
shrewd
and
secret
and
now
turn
this
way
anthony
turned
round
and
saw
the
opposite
wall
slowly
opening
and
in
a
moment
more
he
stepped
out
and
found
himself
in
the
lobby
outside
the
little
room
where
he
had
made
the
exercises
six
years
ago
he
heard
a
door
close
softly
as
he
looked
about
him
in
astonishment
and
on
turning
round
saw
only
an
set
of
shelves
with
a
couple
of
books
and
a
little
pile
of
paper
and
packet
of
quills
upon
them
there
said
buxton
who
would
suspect
tacitus
his
history
and
juvenal
his
satires
of
guarding
the
passage
of
a
christian
ecclesiastic
fleeing
for
his
life
then
he
showed
him
the
secret
how
one
shelf
had
to
be
drawn
out
steadily
and
the
nail
in
another
pressed
simultaneously
and
how
then
the
entire
set
of
shelves
swung
open
then
they
went
back
and
he
showed
him
the
spring
behind
the
frame
of
the
picture
you
see
the
advantage
of
this
he
went
on
on
the
one
side
you
may
flee
upstairs
a
treasonable
skulking
cassocked
with
the
lords
and
the
commons
and
the
queen
majesty
barking
at
your
heels
and
on
the
other
side
you
may
saunter
down
the
gallery
without
your
beard
and
in
a
murrey
doublet
a
friend
of
buxton
taking
the
air
and
wondering
what
the
devil
all
the
clamouring
be
about
then
he
took
him
downstairs
again
and
showed
him
finally
the
escape
of
which
he
was
most
proud
the
entrance
designed
in
the
to
an
underground
passage
from
the
cellars
which
led
he
told
him
across
to
the
beyond
the
that
is
the
pride
of
my
heart
he
said
and
maybe
will
be
useful
some
day
though
i
pray
not
ah
her
grace
and
her
honest
council
are
right
we
papists
are
a
crafty
and
deceitful
folk
father
anthony
the
four
grew
very
intimate
during
those
few
weeks
they
had
many
memories
and
associations
in
common
on
which
to
build
up
friendship
and
the
aid
of
a
common
faith
and
a
common
peril
with
which
to
cement
it
the
gracious
beauty
of
the
house
and
the
life
at
stanfield
too
gilded
it
all
with
a
very
charming
romance
they
were
all
astonished
at
the
easy
intimacy
with
which
they
behaved
one
to
another
mary
corbet
was
obliged
to
return
to
her
duties
at
court
at
the
beginning
of
september
and
she
had
something
of
an
ache
at
her
heart
as
the
time
drew
on
for
she
had
fallen
once
more
seriously
in
love
with
isabel
she
said
a
word
of
it
to
buxton
they
were
walking
in
the
together
after
dinner
on
the
last
day
of
mary
visit
you
have
a
good
chaplain
she
said
what
an
honest
lad
he
is
and
how
serious
and
recollected
please
god
he
at
least
may
escape
their
claws
it
is
often
so
said
buxton
with
those
wholesome
boys
they
grow
up
into
such
simple
men
of
god
and
isabel
said
mary
rustling
round
upon
him
as
she
walked
what
a
great
dame
she
is
become
i
used
to
lie
on
her
bed
and
kick
my
heels
and
laugh
at
her
but
now
i
would
like
to
say
my
prayers
to
her
she
is
somewhat
like
our
lady
herself
so
grave
and
serious
and
yet
so
warm
and
tender
buxton
nodded
sharply
i
felt
sure
you
would
feel
it
he
said
ah
but
i
knew
her
when
she
was
just
a
child
so
simple
that
i
loved
to
startle
her
but
now
but
now
those
two
ladies
have
done
wonders
with
her
she
has
all
the
splendour
of
mary
maxwell
and
all
the
softness
of
margaret
yes
said
the
other
meditatively
the
two
ladies
have
done
it
or
the
grace
of
god
mary
looked
at
him
sideways
and
her
lips
twitched
a
little
yes
or
the
grace
of
god
as
you
say
the
two
laughed
into
each
other
eyes
for
they
understood
one
another
well
presently
mary
went
on
when
you
and
i
fence
together
at
table
she
does
not
turn
frigid
like
so
many
holy
folk
or
peevish
and
bewildered
like
stupid
folk
but
she
just
looks
at
us
and
laughs
far
down
in
those
deep
grey
eyes
of
hers
oh
i
love
her
ended
mary
they
walked
in
silence
a
minute
or
two
and
i
think
i
do
said
buxton
softly
eh
exclaimed
mary
you
do
what
she
had
quite
forgotten
her
last
sentence
it
is
no
matter
he
said
yet
more
softly
and
would
say
no
more
presently
the
talk
fell
on
the
maxwells
and
came
round
to
hubert
they
say
he
would
be
a
favourite
at
court
said
mary
had
he
not
a
wife
but
her
grace
likes
not
married
men
she
looked
kindly
upon
him
at
deptford
i
know
and
i
have
seen
him
at
greenwich
you
know
of
course
about
isabel
buxton
shook
his
head
why
it
was
common
talk
that
they
would
have
been
man
and
wife
years
ago
had
not
the
fool
apostatised
her
companion
questioned
her
further
and
soon
had
the
whole
story
out
of
her
but
i
am
thankful
ended
mary
that
it
has
so
ended
the
next
day
she
went
back
to
court
and
it
was
with
real
grief
that
the
three
watched
her
wonderful
plumed
trot
along
behind
the
top
of
the
churchyard
wall
with
her
woman
beside
her
and
her
little
liveried
troop
of
men
following
at
a
distance
the
days
passed
by
bringing
strange
tidings
to
stanfield
news
continued
to
reach
the
catholics
of
the
good
confessions
witnessed
here
and
there
in
england
by
priests
and
laity
at
the
end
of
july
three
priests
garlick
ludlam
and
sympson
had
been
executed
at
derby
and
at
the
end
of
august
the
defeat
of
the
armada
seemed
to
encourage
elizabeth
yet
further
and
leigh
a
priest
with
four
laymen
and
mistress
margaret
ward
died
for
their
religion
at
tyburn
by
the
end
of
september
the
news
of
the
hopeless
defeat
and
disappearance
of
the
armada
had
by
now
been
certified
over
and
over
again
terrible
stories
had
come
in
during
august
of
that
northward
flight
of
all
that
was
left
of
the
fleet
over
the
plunging
north
sea
up
into
the
stormy
coast
of
scotland
then
rumours
began
of
the
miseries
that
were
falling
on
the
spaniards
off
ireland
catholic
ireland
from
which
they
had
hoped
so
much
there
was
scarcely
a
bay
or
a
cape
along
the
west
coast
where
some
ship
had
not
put
in
with
piteous
entreaties
for
water
and
aid
and
scarcely
a
bay
or
a
cape
that
was
not
along
the
straight
coast
from
sligo
bay
westwards
down
the
west
coast
clew
bay
connemara
and
haunted
dingle
itself
where
the
catholic
religion
under
arms
had
been
so
grievously
chastened
eight
years
ago
everywhere
or
spaniards
piteously
entreating
were
stripped
and
put
to
the
sword
either
by
the
irish
savages
or
the
english
gentlemen
the
were
rung
in
stanfield
and
in
every
english
village
and
the
flame
of
national
pride
and
loyalty
burned
fiercer
and
higher
than
ever
on
the
last
day
of
september
isabel
just
before
dinner
in
her
room
heard
the
trot
of
a
couple
of
horses
coming
up
the
short
drive
and
on
going
downstairs
almost
ran
against
hubert
as
he
came
from
the
corridor
into
the
hall
as
the
servant
ushered
him
in
the
two
stopped
and
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
hubert
was
flushed
with
hard
riding
and
looked
excited
isabel
face
showed
nothing
but
pleasure
and
surprise
the
servant
too
stopped
hesitating
then
isabel
put
out
her
hand
smiling
and
her
voice
was
natural
and
controlled
why
hubert
she
said
it
is
you
come
through
this
way
and
she
nodded
to
the
servant
who
went
forward
and
opened
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
and
stood
back
as
isabel
swept
by
him
when
the
door
was
closed
and
the
servant
footsteps
had
died
away
hubert
as
he
stood
facing
isabel
spoke
at
last
mistress
isabel
he
said
almost
imploringly
what
can
i
say
to
you
your
home
has
been
wrecked
and
partly
through
those
wild
and
foolish
words
of
mine
and
you
repay
it
by
that
act
of
kindness
to
my
wife
i
am
come
to
ask
your
pardon
and
to
thank
you
i
only
reached
home
last
night
ah
that
was
nothing
said
isabel
gently
and
as
for
the
house
as
for
the
house
he
said
i
was
not
master
of
myself
when
i
said
those
words
that
grace
told
you
of
and
i
entreat
you
to
let
me
repair
the
damage
no
no
she
said
anthony
has
given
orders
that
will
all
be
done
but
what
can
i
do
then
he
cried
passionately
if
you
but
knew
my
sorrow
and
and
more
than
that
my
isabel
had
raised
her
grave
eyes
and
was
looking
him
full
in
the
face
now
and
he
stopped
abashed
how
is
grace
and
mercy
she
asked
in
perfectly
even
tones
oh
isabel
he
began
and
again
she
looked
at
him
and
then
went
to
the
door
i
hear
buxton
she
said
and
steps
came
along
through
the
hall
she
opened
the
door
as
he
came
up
buxton
stopped
abruptly
and
the
two
men
drew
themselves
up
and
seemed
to
stiffen
ever
so
slightly
a
shade
of
aggressive
contempt
came
on
hubert
keen
brown
face
that
towered
up
so
near
the
low
oak
ceiling
while
buxton
eyelids
just
drooped
and
his
features
seemed
to
sharpen
there
was
an
unpleasant
silence
isabel
broke
it
you
remember
master
hubert
maxwell
she
said
almost
entreatingly
he
smiled
kindly
at
her
but
his
face
hardened
again
as
he
turned
once
more
to
hubert
i
remember
the
gentleman
perfectly
he
said
and
he
no
doubt
knows
me
and
why
i
can
not
ask
him
to
remain
and
dine
with
us
hubert
smiled
brutally
it
is
the
old
story
of
course
the
faith
i
must
ask
your
pardon
sir
for
intruding
the
difficulty
never
came
into
my
mind
the
truth
is
that
i
have
lived
so
long
now
among
protestants
that
i
had
quite
forgotten
what
catholic
charity
is
like
he
said
this
with
such
extreme
bitterness
and
fury
that
isabel
put
out
her
hand
instinctively
to
buxton
who
smiled
at
her
once
more
and
pressed
it
in
his
own
hubert
laughed
again
sharply
his
face
grew
white
under
the
tan
and
his
lips
wrinkled
back
once
or
twice
so
if
you
can
spare
me
room
to
pass
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
i
will
begone
to
the
inn
buxton
stepped
aside
from
the
door
and
hubert
bowed
to
isabel
so
low
that
it
was
almost
an
insult
in
itself
and
strode
out
his
spurs
ringing
on
the
oak
boards
when
he
half
turned
outside
the
front
door
to
beckon
to
his
groom
to
bring
up
the
horses
he
became
aware
that
isabel
was
beside
him
hubert
she
said
hubert
i
can
not
bear
this
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
and
he
could
not
help
turning
and
looking
at
her
her
face
more
grave
and
transparent
than
ever
was
raised
to
his
her
red
lips
were
trembling
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
great
emotion
he
turned
away
again
sharply
hubert
she
said
again
i
was
not
born
a
catholic
and
i
do
not
feel
like
buxton
and
and
i
do
thank
you
for
coming
and
for
your
desire
to
repair
the
house
and
and
will
you
give
my
love
to
grace
then
he
suddenly
turned
to
her
with
such
passion
in
his
eyes
that
she
shrank
back
at
the
same
moment
the
groom
brought
up
the
horses
he
turned
and
mounted
without
a
word
but
his
eyes
were
dim
with
love
and
anger
and
jealousy
then
he
drove
his
spurs
into
his
great
grey
mare
and
isabel
watched
him
dash
between
the
iron
gates
with
his
groom
only
half
mounted
holding
back
his
own
plunging
horse
then
she
went
within
doors
again
chapter
v
joseph
lackington
it
was
a
bitter
ride
back
to
great
keynes
for
hubert
he
had
just
returned
from
watching
the
fifty
vessels
which
were
all
that
were
left
of
the
great
armada
pass
the
blaskets
still
under
the
nominal
command
of
medina
sidonia
on
their
miserable
return
to
spain
and
he
had
come
back
as
fast
as
sails
could
carry
him
round
the
stormy
up
along
the
south
coast
to
rye
where
on
his
arrival
he
had
been
almost
worshipped
by
the
rejoicing
townsfolk
yet
all
through
his
voyage
and
adventures
at
any
rate
since
his
interview
with
her
at
rye
it
had
been
the
face
of
isabel
there
and
not
of
grace
that
had
glimmered
to
him
in
the
dark
and
led
him
from
peril
to
peril
then
at
last
on
his
arrival
at
home
he
had
heard
of
the
disaster
to
the
dower
house
and
his
own
unintended
share
in
it
and
of
isabel
generous
visit
to
his
wife
and
at
that
he
had
ordered
his
horse
abruptly
and
ridden
off
without
a
word
of
explanation
to
grace
on
the
following
morning
and
he
had
been
met
by
a
sneering
man
who
would
not
sit
at
table
with
him
and
who
was
the
protector
and
friend
of
isabel
he
rode
up
through
the
village
just
after
dark
and
in
through
the
gatehouse
up
to
the
steps
a
man
ran
to
open
the
door
and
as
hubert
came
through
told
him
that
a
stranger
had
ridden
down
from
london
and
had
arrived
at
and
that
he
had
been
waiting
ever
since
i
gave
the
gentleman
dinner
in
the
cloister
parlour
sir
and
he
is
at
supper
now
added
the
man
hubert
nodded
and
pushed
through
the
hall
he
heard
his
name
called
timidly
from
upstairs
and
looking
up
saw
his
wife
golden
head
over
the
banisters
well
he
said
ah
it
is
you
i
am
so
glad
who
else
should
it
be
said
hubert
and
passed
through
towards
the
cloister
wing
and
opened
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
where
isabel
and
mistress
margaret
had
sat
together
years
before
the
night
of
return
and
of
the
girl
decision
a
stranger
rose
up
hastily
as
he
came
in
and
bowed
with
great
deference
hubert
knew
his
face
but
could
not
remember
his
name
i
ask
your
pardon
maxwell
but
your
man
would
take
no
denial
and
he
indicated
the
with
a
steaming
dish
and
a
glass
jug
of
wine
ruddy
in
the
candlelight
hubert
looked
at
him
curiously
i
know
you
sir
he
said
but
i
can
not
put
a
name
to
your
face
lackington
said
the
man
with
a
half
smile
joseph
lackington
hubert
still
stared
and
then
suddenly
burst
into
a
short
laugh
why
yes
he
said
i
know
now
my
father
servant
the
man
bowed
formerly
sir
and
now
agent
to
sir
francis
walsingham
he
said
with
something
of
dignity
in
his
manner
hubert
saw
the
hint
but
could
not
resist
a
small
sneer
why
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
he
said
you
have
come
to
see
your
old
home
and
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
stretched
his
legs
to
the
blaze
for
he
was
stiff
with
riding
lackington
instantly
sat
down
too
for
his
pride
was
touched
it
was
not
for
that
maxwell
he
said
almost
in
the
tone
of
an
equal
but
on
a
mission
for
sir
francis
hubert
looked
at
him
a
moment
as
he
sat
there
in
the
candlelight
with
his
arm
resting
easily
on
the
table
he
was
plainly
prosperous
and
was
even
dressed
with
some
distinction
his
reddish
beard
was
trimmed
to
a
point
his
high
forehead
was
respectably
white
and
bald
and
his
seals
hung
from
his
belt
beside
his
dagger
with
an
air
of
ease
and
solidity
perhaps
he
was
of
some
importance
at
any
rate
sir
francis
walsingham
was
hubert
sat
up
a
little
a
mission
to
me
he
said
lackington
nodded
a
few
questions
on
a
matter
of
state
he
drew
from
his
pouch
a
paper
signed
by
sir
francis
authorising
him
as
an
agent
for
one
month
and
dated
three
days
back
and
handed
it
to
hubert
i
obtained
that
from
sir
francis
on
monday
as
you
will
see
you
can
trust
me
implicitly

the
business
take
long

hubert
handing
the
paper
back
no
maxwell
and
i
must
be
gone
in
an
hour
in
any
case
i
have
to
be
at
rye
at
noon
and
i
must
sleep
at
mayfield
at
rye
said
hubert
why
i
came
from
there
yesterday
lackington
bowed
again
as
if
he
were
quite
aware
of
this
but
said
nothing
then
i
will
sup
here
went
on
hubert
and
we
will
talk
meantime
when
a
place
had
been
laid
for
him
he
drew
his
chair
round
to
the
table
and
began
to
eat
may
i
begin
at
once
asked
lackington
who
had
finished
hubert
nodded
then
first
i
believe
it
to
be
a
fact
that
you
spoke
with
mistress
isabel
morris
on
board
the
at
rye
on
the
tenth
of
august
last
hubert
had
started
violently
at
her
name
but
did
his
utmost
to
gain
outward
command
of
himself
again
immediately
well
he
said
and
with
master
anthony
norris
lately
made
a
priest
beyond
the
seas
that
is
a
lie
said
hubert
lackington
politely
lifted
his
eyebrows
indeed
he
said
that
he
was
made
a
priest
or
that
you
spoke
with
him
that
i
know
aught
of
him
said
hubert
his
heart
was
beating
furiously
lackington
made
a
note
rather
ostentatiously
he
could
see
that
hubert
was
frightened
and
thought
that
it
was
because
of
a
possible
accusation
of
having
dealings
with
a
traitor
and
as
regards
mistress
norris
he
said
judicially
with
his
pencil
raised
you
deny
having
spoken
with
her
hubert
was
thinking
furiously
then
he
saw
that
lackington
knew
too
much
for
its
being
worth
his
own
while
to
deny
it
no
i
never
denied
that
he
said
lifting
his
fork
to
his
mouth
and
he
went
on
eating
with
a
deliberate
ease
as
lackington
again
made
a
note
the
next
question
was
a
where
are
they
both
now
asked
lackington
looking
at
him
mind
laboured
like
a
mill
i
do
not
know
he
said
you
swear
it
i
swear
it
then
mistress
norris
has
changed
her
plans
said
lackington
swiftly
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
she
told
you
where
they
were
going
when
you
met
said
the
other
in
a
remonstrating
tone
hubert
suddenly
saw
the
game
if
the
authorities
really
knew
that
it
would
have
been
a
useless
question
he
stared
at
lackington
with
an
admirable
vacancy
indeed
she
did
not
he
said
for
aught
i
know
they
she
is
in
france
again
they
said
lackington
shrewdly
then
you
do
know
somewhat
of
the
priest
but
hubert
was
again
too
sharp
only
what
you
told
me
just
now
when
you
said
he
was
at
rye
i
supposed
you
were
telling
the
truth
lackington
passed
his
hand
smoothly
over
his
mouth
and
beard
and
smiled
either
hubert
was
very
sharp
or
else
he
had
told
everything
and
he
did
not
believe
him
sharp
thank
you
maxwell
he
said
with
a
complete
dropping
of
his
judicial
manner
i
will
not
pretend
not
to
be
disappointed
but
i
believe
what
you
say
about
france
is
true
and
that
it
is
no
use
looking
for
him
further
hubert
experienced
an
extraordinary
relief
he
had
saved
isabel
he
drank
off
a
glass
of
claret
tell
me
everything
he
said
well
said
lackington
thomas
hamon
is
my
informant
he
sent
up
to
sir
francis
the
message
that
a
lady
of
the
name
of
norris
had
been
introduced
to
him
at
rye
because
he
thought
he
remembered
some
stir
in
the
county
several
years
ago
about
some
reconciliations
to
rome
connected
with
that
name
of
course
we
knew
everything
about
that
and
we
have
our
agents
at
the
seminaries
too
so
we
concluded
that
she
was
one
of
our
birds
the
rest
of
course
was
guesswork
norris
has
certainly
left
douai
for
england
and
he
may
possibly
even
now
be
in
england
but
from
your
information
and
others
i
now
believe
that
mistress
isabel
came
across
first
and
that
she
found
the
country
too
hot
what
with
the
spaniards
and
all
and
that
she
returned
to
france
at
once
of
course
during
that
dreadful
week
maxwell
we
could
not
be
certain
of
all
vessels
that
came
and
went
so
i
think
she
just
slipped
across
again
and
that
they
are
both
waiting
in
france
we
shall
keep
good
watch
now
at
the
ports
i
can
promise
you
hubert
emotions
were
varied
during
this
speech
first
shame
at
having
entirely
forgotten
the
mayor
of
rye
and
his
own
introduction
of
isabel
to
him
then
astonishment
at
the
methods
of
walsingham
agents
and
lastly
intense
triumph
and
relief
at
having
put
them
off
isabel
track
for
anthony
too
he
had
nothing
but
kindly
feelings
so
on
the
whole
he
thought
he
had
done
well
for
his
friends
the
two
talked
a
little
longer
lackington
was
a
stimulating
companion
from
both
his
personality
and
his
position
and
hubert
found
himself
almost
sorry
when
his
companion
said
he
must
be
riding
on
to
mayfield
as
he
walked
out
with
him
to
the
front
door
he
suddenly
thought
of
buxton
again
and
his
reception
in
the
afternoon
they
had
wandered
in
their
conversation
so
far
from
the
norrises
by
now
that
he
felt
sure
he
could
speak
of
him
without
doing
them
any
harm
so
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
together
waiting
for
lackington
horse
to
come
round
he
suddenly
said
do
you
know
aught
of
one
buxton
who
lives
somewhere
near
tonbridge
i
think
buxton
buxton
said
the
other
i
met
him
in
town
once
went
on
hubert
smoothly
a
little
man
dark
with
large
eyes
and
looks
somewhat
like
a
frenchman
buxton
buxton
said
the
other
again
a
papist
is
he
not
yes
said
hubert
hoping
to
get
some
information
against
him
a
friend
asked
lackington
no
said
hubert
with
such
vehemence
that
lackington
looked
at
him
i
remember
him
he
said
in
a
moment
he
was
imprisoned
at
wisbeach
six
or
seven
years
ago
but
i
do
not
think
he
has
been
in
trouble
since
you
wish
you
wish
he
went
on
interrogatively
nothing
said
hubert
but
lackington
saw
the
hatred
in
his
eyes
the
horses
came
round
at
this
moment
and
lackington
said
to
hubert
with
a
touch
of
the
old
deference
again
and
mounted
hubert
watched
him
out
under
the
into
the
night
beyond
and
then
he
went
in
again
pondering
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
now
a
delicate
figure
with
pathetic
blue
eyes
turned
up
to
him
she
ran
to
him
and
took
his
arm
timidly
in
her
two
hands
oh
i
am
glad
that
man
has
gone
hubert
he
looked
down
at
her
almost
contemptuously
why
you
know
nothing
of
him
he
said
not
much
she
said
but
he
asked
me
so
many
questions
hubert
started
and
looked
suddenly
at
her
in
terror
oh
hubert
she
said
shrinking
back
frightened
questions
he
said
seizing
her
hands
questions
of
whom
of
of
mistress
isabel
norris
she
said
almost
crying
and
and
what
did
you
say
did
you
tell
him
oh
hubert
i
am
so
sorry
ah
do
not
look
like
that
what
did
you
say
what
did
you
say
he
said
between
his
teeth
i
i
told
a
lie
hubert
i
said
i
had
never
seen
her
hubert
took
his
wife
suddenly
in
his
two
arms
and
kissed
her
three
or
four
times
you
darling
you
darling
he
said
and
then
stooped
and
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
upstairs
with
her
head
against
his
cheek
and
her
tears
running
down
because
he
was
pleased
with
her
instead
of
angry
they
went
upstairs
and
he
set
her
down
softly
outside
the
nursery
door
hush
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
and
then
softly
opened
the
door
and
listened
her
finger
on
her
lip
there
was
no
sound
from
within
then
she
pushed
the
door
open
gently
and
the
wife
and
husband
went
in
there
was
a
shaded
taper
still
burning
in
a
high
bracket
where
an
image
of
the
mother
of
god
had
stood
in
the
catholic
days
of
the
house
hubert
glanced
up
at
it
and
remembered
it
with
just
a
touch
at
his
heart
beneath
it
was
a
little
oak
cot
where
his
boy
lay
sleeping
the
mother
went
across
and
bent
over
it
and
hubert
leaned
his
brown
sinewy
hands
on
the
end
of
the
cot
and
watched
him
there
his
son
lay
with
tangled
curls
on
the
pillow
his
finger
was
on
his
lips
as
if
he
bade
silence
even
to
thought
hubert
looked
up
and
just
above
the
bed
where
the
crucifix
used
to
hang
when
he
himself
had
slept
in
this
nursery
probably
on
the
very
same
nail
he
thought
to
himself
was
a
rusty
spanish
spur
that
he
himself
had
found
in
a
of
the
the
boy
had
hung
up
with
a
tarry
bit
of
string
this
emblem
of
his
father
victory
as
a
protection
while
he
slept
the
child
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
murmured
as
the
two
watched
him
father
home
again
whispered
the
mother
it
is
all
well
go
to
sleep
again
when
she
looked
up
again
to
her
husband
he
was
gone
it
was
not
often
that
hubert
had
regrets
for
the
faith
he
had
lost
but
things
had
conspired
to
prick
him
there
was
his
rebuff
from
buxton
there
was
the
sight
of
isabel
in
the
dignified
grace
that
he
had
noticed
so
plainly
before
there
had
been
the
interview
with
the
servant
now
a
spy
of
the
government
and
a
remorseless
enemy
of
all
catholics
and
lastly
there
were
the
two
little
external
reminders
of
the
niche
and
the
nail
over
his
son
bed
he
sat
long
before
the
fire
in
sir
nicholas
old
room
now
his
own
study
as
he
lay
back
and
looked
about
him
how
different
this
all
was
too
the
mantelpiece
was
almost
unaltered
the
maxwell
devices
eagles
hurcheons
and
saltires
on
crowded
shields
interlaced
with
the
motto
all
newly
gilded
since
his
own
accession
to
the
estate
rose
up
in
deep
shadow
and
relief
but
over
it
instead
of
the
little
old
picture
of
the
vernacle
that
he
remembered
as
a
child
hung
his
own
sword
was
that
a
sign
of
progress
he
wondered
the
tapestry
on
the
east
wall
was
the
same
a
hawking
scene
with
herons
and
ladies
in
immense
headdresses
that
he
had
marvelled
at
as
a
boy
but
then
the
books
on
the
shelves
to
the
right
of
the
door
they
were
different
there
had
been
old
devotional
books
in
his
father
time
mingled
strangely
with
small
works
on
country
life
and
sports
now
the
latter
only
remained
and
the
nearest
to
a
devotional
book
was
a
volume
of
a
mystical
herbalist
who
identified
plants
with
virtues
strangely
and
ingeniously
then
the
where
the
beads
had
hung
and
the
little
wooden
shield
with
the
five
wounds
painted
upon
it
that
was
gone
and
in
its
place
hung
a
cupboard
where
he
kept
a
crossbow
and
a
few
tools
for
it
and
old
and
jesses
and
the
like
then
he
lay
back
again
and
thought
had
he
then
behaved
unworthily
this
old
faith
that
had
been
handed
down
from
father
and
son
for
generations
that
had
been
handed
to
him
too
as
the
most
precious
heirloom
of
all
for
which
his
father
had
so
gladly
suffered
fines
and
imprisonment
and
risked
death
he
had
thrown
it
over
and
for
what
for
isabel
he
confessed
to
himself
and
then
the
the
power
that
stands
behind
the
visible
had
cheated
him
and
withdrawn
that
for
which
he
had
paid
over
that
great
price
was
that
a
reckless
and
brutal
bargain
on
his
side
to
throw
over
this
strange
delicate
thing
called
the
faith
for
which
so
many
millions
had
lived
and
died
all
for
a
woman
love
a
curious
kind
of
family
pride
in
the
faith
began
to
prick
him
after
all
was
not
honour
in
a
manner
bound
up
with
it
too
and
most
of
all
when
such
heavy
penalties
attached
themselves
to
the
profession
of
it
was
that
the
moment
when
he
should
be
the
first
of
his
line
to
abandon
it
i
renew
my
springtide
but
was
not
this
a
strange
grafting
a
spur
for
a
crucifix
a
crossbow
for
a
place
of
prayer
there
was
sap
indeed
in
the
old
tree
but
from
what
soil
did
it
draw
its
strength
his
heart
began
to
burn
with
something
like
shame
as
it
had
burned
now
and
again
at
intervals
during
these
past
years
here
he
lay
back
in
his
father
chair
in
his
father
room
the
first
protestant
of
the
maxwells
then
he
passed
on
to
a
memory
as
he
closed
his
eyes
he
could
see
even
now
the
chapel
upstairs
with
the
tapers
alight
and
the
stiff
figure
of
the
priest
in
the
midst
of
the
glow
he
could
smell
the
flowers
on
the
altar
the
june
roses
strewn
on
the
floor
in
the
old
manner
and
their
fresh
dewy
scent
mingled
with
the
fragrance
of
the
rich
incense
in
an
intoxicating
chord
he
could
hear
the
rustle
that
emphasised
the
silence
as
his
mother
rose
from
his
side
and
went
up
for
communion
and
the
breathing
of
the
servants
behind
him
then
for
contrast
he
remembered
the
whitewashed
church
where
he
attended
now
with
his
wife
sunday
by
sunday
the
pulpit
occupied
by
the
black
figure
of
the
virtuous
bodder
pronouncing
his
discourse
the
great
texts
that
stood
out
in
their
new
paint
from
the
walls
the
table
that
stood
out
unashamed
and
sideways
in
the
midst
of
the
chancel
and
which
of
the
two
worships
was
most
like
god
then
he
compared
the
worshippers
in
either
mode
well
drake
his
hero
was
a
convinced
protestant
the
bravest
man
he
had
ever
met
or
dreamed
of
fiery
pertinacious
gloriously
insolent
he
thought
of
his
sailors
on
whom
a
portion
of
drake
spirit
fell
their
gallantry
their
fearlessness
of
death
and
of
all
that
comes
after
of
bodder
who
was
now
growing
in
the
vicarage
yes
indeed
they
were
all
admirable
in
various
ways
but
were
they
like
christ
on
the
other
hand
his
father
in
spite
of
his
quick
temper
his
mother
brother
aunt
the
priests
who
came
and
went
by
night
isabel
and
at
that
he
stopped
and
like
a
deep
voice
in
his
ear
rose
up
the
last
tremendous
question
what
if
the
catholic
religion
be
true
after
all
and
at
that
the
supernatural
began
to
assert
itself
it
seemed
as
if
the
empty
air
were
full
of
this
question
rising
in
intensity
and
emphasis
what
if
it
is
true
what
if
it
is
true
if
it
is
true
he
sat
bolt
upright
and
looked
sharply
round
the
room
the
candles
burned
steadily
in
the
sconce
near
the
door
the
tapestry
lifted
and
dropped
noiselessly
in
the
draught
the
dark
corners
beyond
the
press
and
in
the
window
recesses
suggested
presences
that
waited
the
wide
chimney
sighed
suddenly
once
was
that
a
voice
in
his
ear
just
now
or
only
in
his
heart
but
in
either
case
he
made
an
effort
to
command
himself
and
looked
again
steadily
round
the
room
but
there
seemed
no
one
there
but
what
if
the
old
tale
be
true
in
that
case
he
is
not
alone
in
this
little
oak
room
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
loneliness
in
that
case
he
is
sitting
in
full
sight
of
almighty
god
whom
he
has
insulted
and
of
the
saints
whose
power
he
has
repudiated
and
of
the
angels
good
and
bad
who
have
ah
what
was
that
there
had
seemed
to
come
a
long
sigh
somewhere
behind
him
on
his
left
what
was
it
some
wandering
soul
was
it
could
it
be
the
soul
of
one
who
had
loved
him
and
desired
to
warn
him
before
it
was
too
late
could
it
have
been
and
then
it
came
again
and
the
hair
prickled
on
his
head
how
deathly
still
it
is
and
how
cold
ah
was
that
a
rustle
outside
a
tap
in
god
name
who
can
that
be
and
then
hubert
licked
his
dry
lips
and
brought
them
together
and
smiled
at
grace
who
had
come
down
opening
the
doors
as
she
came
to
see
why
he
had
not
come
to
bed
bah
what
a
superstitious
fool
he
was
after
all
chapter
vi
a
departure
the
months
went
by
happily
at
stanfield
and
however
ill
went
the
fortunes
of
the
church
elsewhere
here
at
least
were
peace
and
prosperity
most
discouraging
news
indeed
did
reach
them
from
time
to
time
the
severe
penalties
now
enacted
against
the
practice
of
the
catholic
religion
were
being
enforced
with
great
vigour
and
the
weak
members
of
the
body
began
to
fail
two
priests
had
apostatised
at
chichester
earlier
in
the
year
one
of
them
actually
at
the
scaffold
on
broyle
heath
and
then
in
december
there
were
two
more
recantations
at
paul
cross
those
catholics
too
who
threw
up
the
faith
generally
became
the
most
aggressive
among
the
persecutors
to
testify
to
their
own
consciences
as
well
to
the
protestants
of
the
sincerity
of
their
conversion
but
in
stanfield
the
church
flourished
and
anthony
had
the
great
happiness
of
receiving
his
first
convert
in
the
person
of
rowe
the
young
owner
of
a
house
called
east
maskells
separated
from
stanfield
place
by
a
of
under
a
mile
in
length
though
the
road
round
was
over
two
and
the
comings
and
goings
were
frequent
now
between
the
two
houses
rowe
was
at
present
unmarried
and
had
his
aunt
to
keep
house
for
him
a
tolerant
old
maiden
lady
who
had
conformed
placidly
to
the
reformed
religion
thirty
years
before
and
was
now
grown
content
with
it
several
schismatics
too
as
those
catholics
were
called
who
attended
their
parish
church
had
waxed
bolder
and
given
up
their
conformity
to
the
establishment
so
it
was
a
happy
and
courageous
flock
that
gathered
sunday
by
sunday
at
stanfield
place
just
before
christmas
anthony
received
a
long
and
affectionate
letter
from
james
maxwell
who
was
still
at
douai
the
rector
will
still
have
me
here
he
wrote
and
shows
me
to
the
young
men
as
if
i
were
a
kind
of
warrior
which
is
bad
for
pride
but
then
he
humbles
me
again
by
telling
me
i
am
of
more
use
here
as
an
example
than
i
should
be
in
england
and
that
humbles
me
again
so
i
am
content
to
stay
it
is
a
humbling
thing
too
to
find
young
men
who
can
tell
me
the
history
of
my
arms
and
legs
better
than
i
know
it
myself
but
the
truth
is
i
can
never
walk
well
again
yet
jesus
then
james
maxwell
wrote
a
little
about
his
grief
for
hubert
gave
a
little
news
of
foreign
movements
among
the
catholics
and
finally
ended
as
follows
at
last
i
understand
who
your
friend
was
behind
bow
church
who
stuttered
and
played
the
catholic
so
well
it
was
our
old
servant
lackington
who
turned
protestant
and
entered
walsingham
service
i
hear
all
this
from
one
lately
in
the
same
affairs
but
now
turned
to
christ
his
service
instead
and
who
has
entered
here
as
a
student
so
beware
of
him
he
has
a
pointed
beard
now
and
a
bald
forehead
i
hear
too
from
the
same
source
that
he
was
on
your
track
when
you
landed
but
now
thinks
you
to
be
in
france
however
he
knows
of
you
so
i
counsel
you
not
to
abide
over
long
in
one
place
perhaps
you
may
go
to
lancashire
that
is
like
heaven
itself
for
catholics
their
zeal
and
piety
there
are
beyond
praise
but
i
hear
they
somewhat
lack
priests
god
keep
you
always
my
dear
brother
and
may
the
queen
of
heaven
intercede
for
you
pray
for
me
soon
after
the
new
year
mary
corbet
was
able
to
get
away
from
court
and
come
down
again
to
her
friends
for
a
month
or
two
at
stanfield
during
her
stay
they
all
had
an
adventure
together
at
east
maskells
they
had
been
out
a
long
expedition
into
the
woods
one
clear
frosty
day
and
rode
in
just
at
sunset
for
an
early
supper
with
rowe
and
his
aunt
they
had
left
their
horses
at
the
stable
and
come
in
round
the
back
of
the
house
so
that
they
missed
the
servant
miss
rowe
had
placed
at
the
front
door
to
warn
them
and
came
straight
into
the
where
they
found
miss
rowe
in
conversation
with
an
ecclesiastic
there
was
no
time
to
retreat
and
anthony
in
a
moment
more
found
himself
being
introduced
to
a
minister
he
had
met
at
lambeth
more
than
once
the
reverend
robert
carr
who
had
held
the
odd
title
of
archbishop
curate
and
the
position
of
minister
in
charge
of
the
once
collegiate
church
of
all
saints
maidstone
ever
since
the
year
he
had
ridden
up
from
maidstone
for
supper
and
lodging
and
was
on
his
way
to
town
anthony
managed
to
interrupt
miss
rowe
before
she
came
to
his
assumed
name
capell
and
remarked
rather
loudly
that
he
had
met
carr
before
who
recognised
him
too
and
greeted
him
by
his
real
name
it
was
an
uncomfortable
situation
as
carr
was
quite
unaware
of
the
religion
of
five
out
of
six
of
those
present
and
very
soon
began
to
give
voice
to
his
views
on
papistry
he
was
an
oldish
man
by
now
and
of
some
importance
in
maidstone
where
he
had
been
appointed
jurat
by
the
corporation
and
was
a
very
popular
and
influential
man
the
voice
of
the
people
he
said
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
the
national
feeling
towards
spain
that
is
what
we
must
hearken
to
even
sovereigns
themselves
must
come
to
that
some
day
they
must
rule
by
obeying
as
man
does
with
god
laws
in
nature
would
you
say
that
sir
of
her
grace
asked
mary
corbet
meekly
i
should
madam
though
i
fear
she
has
injured
her
power
by
her
behaviour
this
year
it
was
her
people
who
saved
hawkins
who
is
now
ruined
as
he
says
my
lord
howard
who
has
paid
from
his
own
purse
for
the
meat
and
drink
of
her
grace
soldiers
and
those
who
fought
with
them
and
not
her
grace
who
saved
them
or
leicester
now
gone
to
his
account
who
sat
at
tilbury
and
did
the
bowing
and
the
prancing
and
the
talking
while
hawkins
and
the
rest
did
the
fighting
no
madam
it
is
the
voice
of
the
people
to
which
we
must
hearken
this
was
rather
confused
and
dangerous
talking
too
but
here
was
plainly
a
man
to
be
humoured
he
looked
round
him
with
a
suffused
face
and
the
eye
of
a
cock
and
a
little
white
plume
on
his
forehead
increased
his
appearance
of
pugnacity
it
is
the
same
in
religion
he
said
when
all
preserved
a
deferential
silence
it
is
that
that
lies
at
the
root
of
papist
errors
as
you
know
very
well
he
went
on
turning
suddenly
on
anthony
our
bishops
do
nothing
to
guide
men
minds
they
only
seem
to
they
ride
atop
like
the
figure
on
a
but
it
is
the
legs
beneath
that
do
the
work
and
the
guiding
too
now
that
is
right
and
good
and
the
church
of
england
will
prosper
so
long
as
she
goes
like
that
but
if
the
bishops
try
to
rule
they
will
find
their
mistake
now
the
popish
church
is
not
like
that
she
holds
that
power
comes
from
above
that
the
pope
guides
the
bishops
the
bishops
the
priests
and
the
priests
the
people
and
the
holy
ghost
the
pope
is
it
not
so
sir
asked
buxton
carr
turned
an
eye
on
him
so
they
hold
sir
he
said
after
a
pause
they
think
then
sir
that
the
shepherds
guide
the
sheep
asked
anthony
humbly
mary
corbet
gave
a
yelp
of
laughter
but
when
carr
looked
at
her
she
was
grave
and
deferential
again
miss
rowe
looked
entreatingly
from
face
to
face
the
minister
did
not
notice
anthony
remark
but
swept
on
again
on
what
was
plainly
his
favourite
theme
the
infallibility
of
the
people
it
was
a
doctrine
that
was
hardly
held
yet
by
any
but
the
next
century
was
to
see
its
gradual
rise
until
it
reached
its
climax
in
the
puritanism
of
the
stuart
times
it
was
true
as
carr
said
that
elizabeth
had
ruled
by
obeying
and
that
the
people
of
england
encouraged
by
success
in
resisting
foreign
domination
were
about
to
pass
on
to
the
second
position
of
resisting
any
domination
at
all
presently
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
small
printed
sheet
and
was
soon
declaiming
from
it
it
was
not
very
much
to
the
point
except
as
illustrating
the
national
spirit
which
he
believed
so
divine
it
was
a
ballad
describing
the
tortures
which
the
spaniards
had
intended
to
inflict
upon
the
heretic
english
and
began
all
you
that
list
to
look
and
see
what
profit
comes
from
spain
and
what
the
pope
and
spaniards
both
prepared
for
our
gain
then
turn
your
eyes
and
lend
your
ears
and
you
shall
hear
and
see
what
courteous
minds
what
gentle
hearts
they
bear
to
thee
and
me
and
it
ended
in
the
same
spirit
be
these
the
men
that
are
so
mild
whom
some
so
holy
call
the
lord
defend
our
noble
queen
and
country
from
them
all
there
the
minister
cried
when
he
had
done
that
is
what
the
papists
are
like
trust
me
i
know
them
i
should
know
one
in
a
moment
if
he
ventured
into
this
room
by
his
crafty
face
but
the
lord
will
defend
his
own
englishmen
nay
he
has
done
so
blew
and
they
were
scattered
he
ended
quoting
from
the
armada
medal
as
the
four
rode
home
by
pairs
across
the
in
the
frosty
moonlight
buxton
lamented
to
anthony
the
effect
of
the
armada
the
national
spirit
is
higher
than
ever
he
said
and
it
will
be
the
death
of
catholicism
here
for
the
present
our
country
squires
i
fear
faithful
catholics
to
this
time
are
beginning
to
wonder
and
question
when
will
our
catholic
kings
learn
that
christ
his
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
philip
has
smitten
the
faith
in
england
with
the
weapon
which
he
drew
in
its
defence
as
he
thought
i
was
once
of
that
national
spirit
myself
said
anthony
i
remember
you
were
said
buxton
smiling
and
what
grace
has
done
to
you
it
may
do
to
others
the
spring
went
by
and
in
the
week
after
easter
james
news
about
lancashire
was
verified
by
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
buxton
a
norreys
the
owner
of
one
of
the
staunch
catholic
houses
speke
hall
on
the
bank
of
the
mersey
here
he
wrote
by
the
mercy
of
god
there
is
no
lack
of
priests
though
there
be
none
to
spare
my
own
chaplain
says
mass
by
dispensation
thrice
on
sunday
but
on
the
moors
the
sheep
look
up
and
are
not
fed
and
such
patient
sheep
i
heard
but
last
week
of
a
church
where
the
folk
resort
priest
or
no
each
sunday
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
and
are
led
by
a
lector
in
devotion
ending
with
an
act
of
spiritual
communion
made
all
together
these
damnable
heresies
of
which
the
apostle
wrote
have
not
poisoned
the
springs
of
sound
doctrine
some
of
us
here
know
naught
yet
of
elizabeth
and
her
supremacy
or
even
of
harry
his
reformation
send
us
then
dear
friend
a
priest
or
at
least
the
promise
of
one
lest
we
perish
quite
buxton
had
a
sore
struggle
with
himself
over
this
letter
but
at
last
he
carried
it
to
anthony
read
that
he
said
and
stood
waiting
anthony
looked
up
when
he
had
done
i
am
your
chaplain
he
said
but
i
am
god
priest
first
yes
dear
lad
said
his
friend
i
feared
you
would
say
so
and
i
will
say
so
to
norreys
and
he
left
the
room
at
once
and
so
at
last
it
came
to
be
arranged
that
anthony
should
leave
for
lancashire
at
the
end
of
july
and
that
after
his
departure
stanfield
should
be
served
occasionally
by
the
priest
who
lived
on
the
outskirts
of
tonbridge
but
the
daily
mass
would
have
to
cease
and
that
was
a
sore
trouble
to
buxton
no
definite
decision
could
be
made
as
to
when
anthony
could
return
that
must
wait
until
he
saw
the
needs
of
lancashire
but
he
hoped
to
be
able
at
least
to
pay
a
visit
to
stanfield
again
in
the
spring
of
the
following
year
it
was
arranged
also
of
course
that
isabel
should
accompany
her
brother
they
were
both
of
large
independent
means
and
could
travel
in
some
dignity
and
her
presence
would
be
under
these
circumstances
a
protection
as
well
as
a
comfort
to
anthony
it
would
need
very
great
sharpness
to
detect
the
seminary
priest
under
anthony
disguise
and
amid
the
surroundings
of
his
cavalcade
of
four
or
five
armed
servants
a
french
maid
and
a
lady
yet
in
spite
of
this
buxton
resolved
to
do
his
utmost
to
prevent
isabel
from
going
to
lancashire
partly
of
course
he
disliked
the
thought
of
the
dangers
and
hardships
that
she
was
certain
to
encounter
but
the
real
motive
was
that
he
had
fallen
very
deeply
in
love
with
her
it
was
her
exceptional
serenity
that
seemed
to
him
her
greatest
charm
her
movements
her
face
her
grey
eyes
the
very
folds
of
her
dress
seemed
to
breathe
with
it
and
to
one
of
buxton
temperament
such
a
presence
was
cool
and
sweet
and
strangely
fascinating
it
was
now
april
and
he
resolved
to
devote
the
next
month
or
two
to
preparing
her
for
his
proposal
and
he
wrote
frankly
to
mary
corbet
telling
her
how
matters
stood
entreating
her
to
come
down
for
july
and
counsel
him
mary
wrote
back
at
once
rather
briefly
promising
to
come
but
not
encouraging
him
greatly
i
would
i
could
cheer
you
more
she
wrote
of
course
i
have
not
seen
isabel
since
january
but
unless
she
has
changed
i
do
not
think
she
will
marry
you
i
am
writing
plainly
you
see
as
you
ask
in
your
letter
but
i
can
still
say
god
prosper
you
as
the
spring
went
by
and
the
summer
came
on
isabel
grew
yet
more
silent
as
the
evenings
began
to
lengthen
out
she
used
to
spend
much
time
before
and
after
supper
in
walking
up
and
down
the
clipped
lime
avenue
between
the
east
end
of
the
church
and
the
great
gates
that
looked
over
the
meadows
across
which
the
stream
and
the
ran
towards
east
maskells
buxton
would
watch
her
sometimes
from
an
upstairs
window
himself
unseen
and
occasionally
would
go
out
and
talk
with
her
but
he
found
it
harder
than
he
used
to
get
on
to
intimate
relations
and
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
had
displeased
her
in
some
way
and
that
mary
corbet
was
right
in
the
afternoon
she
and
anthony
would
generally
ride
out
together
once
or
twice
going
round
by
penshurst
and
their
host
would
torture
himself
by
his
own
indecision
as
regards
accompanying
them
sometimes
doing
so
sometimes
refraining
and
regretting
whichever
he
did
more
and
more
he
began
to
look
forward
to
mary
coming
and
the
benefit
of
her
advice
and
at
last
at
the
end
of
june
she
came
their
first
evening
together
was
delightful
for
them
all
she
was
happy
at
her
escape
from
court
her
host
was
happy
at
the
prospect
of
her
counsel
and
all
four
were
happy
at
being
together
again
they
did
not
meet
till
supper
and
even
that
was
put
off
an
hour
because
mary
had
not
come
and
when
she
did
arrive
she
was
full
of
excitement
i
will
tell
you
all
at
supper
she
said
to
her
host
whom
she
met
in
the
hall
oh
how
late
i
am
and
she
whirled
past
him
and
upstairs
without
another
word
i
will
first
give
you
the
news
in
brief
she
said
when
anthony
had
said
grace
and
they
were
seated

and
i
have
robbed
a
highwayman
this
day
in
the
beech
woods
this
side
of
groombridge
dear
lady
said
buxton
resignedly
as
the
others
looked
up
startled
you
are
too
swift
for
our
dull
rustic
ears
we
will
begin
at
the
end
if
you
please
is
it
true
you
have
robbed
an
highwayman
it
is
perfectly
true
she
said
and
unlatched
a
ruby
brooch
made
from
her
dress
there
is
the
plunder
and
she
held
it
out
for
inspection
then
tell
us
the
tale
said
anthony
it
would
be
five
of
the
clock
said
mary
as
we
came
through
groombridge
and
then
into
the
woods
beyond
i
had
bidden
my
knaves
ride
on
before
with
my
woman
i
came
down
into
a
dingle
where
there
was
a
stream
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
my
head
down
and
was
when
my
horse
stopped
and
i
looked
up
of
a
sudden
and
there
was
a
man
on
a
bay
mare
with
a
mask
to
his
mouth
a
gay
green
suit
a
brown
beard
turning
grey
and
this
ruby
brooch
at
his
throat
and
he
had
caught
my
bridle
i
saw
him
start
when
i
lifted
my
head
as
if
he
were
taken
aback
i
said
nothing
but
he
led
my
horse
off
the
road
down
among
the
trees
with
a
deep
little
thicket
where
none
could
see
us
as
we
went
i
was
thinking
like
a
windmill
for
i
knew
i
had
seen
the
little
red
brooch
before
when
we
reached
the
little
open
space
i
asked
him
what
he
wished
with
me
purse
madam
said
he
woman
hath
it
said
i
jewels
then
madam
said
he
woman
hath
them
said
i
this
paste
buckle
in
my
hat
to
which
you
are
welcome
it
was
diamonds
you
know
but
i
knew
he
would
not
know
that
a
mistake
i
said
stop
the
mistress
and
let
the
maid
go
free
he
said
am
glad
of
it
for
at
least
i
will
have
a
dance
with
the
mistress
and
i
could
not
with
the
maid
are
welcome
to
that
i
said
and
i
slipped
off
my
horse
to
humour
him
and
even
as
i
slipped
off
i
knew
who
he
was
for
although
many
have
red
brooches
and
many
brown
beards
turning
grey
few
have
both
together
but
i
said
nothing
and
there
will
you
believe
it
we
danced
under
the
like
phyllis
and
corydon
or
whoever
they
are
that
sidney
is
always
prating
of
or
like
two
fools
i
would
sooner
say
then
when
we
had
done
i
made
him
a
curtsey
you
must
help
me
up
said
i
and
he
mounted
me
without
a
word
for
he
was
a
stoutish
gallant
and
somewhat
out
of
breath
and
then
what
did
the
fool
do
but
try
to
kiss
me
and
as
he
lifted
his
arm
i
snatched
the
brooch
and
put
spur
to
my
horse
and
as
we
went
up
the
bank
i
screamed
at
him
you
fool
go
home
to
your
wife
and
take
shame
to
yourself
and
when
i
was
near
the
road
i
looked
back
and
he
still
stood
there
all
agape
and
what
was
his
name
asked
anthony
nay
nay
i
have
mocked
him
enough
and
i
know
four
claudes
so
you
need
not
try
to
guess
when
supper
was
over
buxton
and
mary
walked
up
and
down
the
south
path
of
the
garden
between
the
yews
while
the
other
two
sat
just
outside
the
hall
window
on
a
seat
placed
on
the
tiled
terrace
that
ran
round
the
house
how
i
have
longed
for
you
to
come
mistress
mary
he
said
and
counsel
me
of
the
matter
we
wrote
about
tell
me
what
to
do
mary
looked
meditatively
out
to
the
strip
of
moon
that
was
rising
out
to
the
east
in
the
june
sky
then
she
looked
tenderly
at
her
friend
i
hate
to
pain
you
she
said
but
can
not
you
see
that
it
is
impossible
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
her
heart
is
so
given
to
our
saviour
that
there
is
no
love
of
that
sort
left
ah
how
can
you
say
that
he
cried
the
love
of
the
saviour
does
not
hinder
earthly
love
it
purifies
and
transfigures
it
yes
said
mary
gravely
it
is
often
so
but
the
love
of
the
true
spouse
of
christ
is
different
that
leaves
no
room
for
an
earthly
bridegroom
buxton
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
you
mean
it
is
the
love
of
the
consecrated
soul
mary
bowed
her
head
but
i
can
not
be
sure
she
added
then
what
shall
i
do
he
said
again
almost
piteously
and
mary
could
see
even
in
the
faint
moonlight
that
his
pleasant
face
was
all
broken
up
and
quivering
she
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
arm
and
her
rings
flashed
you
must
be
very
patient
she
said
very
full
of
deference
and
grave
you
must
not
be
ardent
nor
impetuous
but
speak
slowly
and
reverently
to
her
but
at
no
great
length
be
plain
with
her
do
not
look
in
her
face
and
do
not
show
anxiety
or
despair
or
hope
you
need
not
fear
that
your
love
will
not
be
plain
to
her
indeed
i
think
she
knows
it
already
why
i
have
not
he
began
i
know
you
have
not
spoken
to
her
but
i
saw
that
she
only
looked
at
you
once
during
supper
and
that
was
when
your
face
was
turned
from
her
she
does
not
wish
to
look
you
in
the
eyes
ah
she
hates
me
he
sighed
do
not
be
foolish
said
mary
she
honours
you
and
loves
you
and
is
grieved
for
your
grief
but
i
do
not
think
she
will
marry
you
and
when
shall
i
speak
he
asked
you
must
wait
god
will
make
the
opportunity
in
any
case
you
must
not
attempt
to
make
it
that
would
terrify
her
and
you
will
speak
for
me
mary
smiled
at
him
dear
friend
she
said
sometimes
i
think
you
do
not
know
us
at
all
do
you
not
see
that
isabel
is
greater
than
all
that
what
she
knows
she
knows
i
could
tell
her
nothing
the
days
passed
on
the
days
of
the
last
month
of
the
norrises
stay
at
stanfield
through
the
month
came
the
news
of
the
oxford
executions
ah
listen
to
this
cried
buxton
coming
out
to
them
one
evening
in
the
garden
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
prichard
he
read
a
good
end
he
protested
he
was
condemned
for
the
catholic
faith
that
he
willingly
died
for
it
that
he
was
a
catholic
one
of
their
ministers
laughed
at
him
saying
he
was
a
poor
ignorant
fellow
who
knew
not
what
it
was
to
be
a
catholic
know
very
well
said
humphrey
i
can
not
say
it
in
proper
divinity
language
there
is
the
religion
for
you
went
on
buxton
all
meet
there
wise
and
simple
alike
there
is
no
difference
no
scholarship
is
needed
for
faith
know
what
it
is
cried
humphrey
i
can
not
explain
it
the
news
came
to
anthony
just
when
he
needed
it
he
felt
he
had
done
so
little
to
teach
his
flock
now
he
was
to
leave
them
but
if
he
had
only
done
something
to
keep
alive
the
fire
of
faith
he
had
not
lost
his
time
and
so
he
went
about
his
spiritual
affairs
with
new
heart
encouraging
the
wavering
whom
he
was
to
leave
warning
the
urging
the
hesitating
and
saying
to
them
all
isabel
went
with
him
sometimes
or
sometimes
walked
or
rode
with
mary
and
was
silent
for
the
most
part
in
public
the
master
of
the
house
himself
did
his
affairs
and
carried
a
heavier
heart
each
day
and
at
last
the
opportunity
came
which
mary
had
predicted
he
had
come
in
one
evening
after
a
hot
ride
alone
over
to
tonbridge
on
some
business
with
the
priest
there
and
had
dressed
for
supper
immediately
on
coming
in
as
there
was
still
nearly
an
hour
before
supper
he
went
out
to
walk
up
and
down
the
same
near
the
where
he
had
walked
with
mary
anthony
and
isabel
had
returned
a
little
later
from
east
maskells
and
they
too
had
dressed
early
isabel
threw
a
lace
shawl
over
her
head
and
betook
herself
too
to
the
alley
and
there
she
turned
a
corner
and
almost
ran
into
her
host
it
was
as
mary
had
said
a
opportunity
neither
time
nor
place
could
have
been
improved
if
externals
were
of
any
value
to
this
courtship
all
that
could
have
helped
was
there
the
setting
of
the
picture
was
perfect
a
tall
ran
down
the
northern
side
of
the
walk
cut
as
bacon
recommended
not
fantastically
but
with
some
pretty
pyramids
a
strip
of
turf
separated
it
from
the
walk
giving
a
sense
both
of
privacy
and
space
on
the
south
side
ran
in
the
turf
with
yews
and
cypresses
planted
here
and
there
and
an
oak
paling
beyond
to
the
east
lay
the
fair
mount
again
recommended
by
the
same
authority
but
not
so
high
and
with
but
one
ascent
to
the
west
the
path
darkened
under
trees
and
over
all
rose
up
against
the
sunset
sky
the
tall
grotesque
towers
and
vanes
of
the
the
flowers
burned
with
that
glow
which
may
be
seen
on
summer
evenings
and
poured
out
their
scent
the
air
was
sweet
and
cool
and
white
moths
were
beginning
to
poise
and
stir
among
the
blossoms
the
two
actors
on
this
scene
too
were
not
unworthy
of
it
his
dark
velvet
and
lace
with
the
glimmer
of
diamonds
here
and
there
and
his
delicate
bearded
face
a
little
tanned
thrown
into
relief
by
the
spotless
crisp
ruff
beneath
and
above
all
his
air
of
strength
and
refinement
and
all
combined
to
make
him
a
formidable
stormer
of
a
girl
heart
and
as
he
looked
on
her
on
her
clear
almost
luminous
face
and
great
eyes
shrined
in
the
drooping
lace
shawl
through
which
a
jewel
or
two
in
her
black
hair
glimmered
her
upright
slender
figure
in
its
dark
sheath
and
the
hand
white
and
cool
that
held
her
shawl
together
over
her
breast
he
had
a
pang
of
hope
and
despair
at
once
at
the
sudden
sense
of
need
of
this
splendid
creature
of
god
to
be
one
with
him
and
reign
with
him
over
these
fair
possessions
and
of
hopelessness
at
the
thought
that
anything
so
perfect
could
be
accomplished
in
this
imperfect
world
he
turned
immediately
and
walked
beside
her
and
they
both
knew
in
the
silence
that
followed
that
the
crisis
had
come
mistress
isabel
he
said
still
looking
down
as
he
spoke
and
his
voice
sounded
odd
to
her
ears
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
i
would
say
to
you
there
came
no
sound
from
her
but
the
rustle
of
her
dress
but
i
must
say
it
he
went
on
follow
what
may
it
is
this
i
love
you
dearly
her
walk
faltered
beside
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
stand
still
a
moment
he
said
and
he
lifted
his
white
restrained
face
i
ask
you
to
be
patient
with
me
perhaps
i
need
not
say
that
i
have
never
said
this
to
any
woman
before
but
more
i
have
never
even
thought
it
i
do
not
know
how
to
speak
nor
what
i
should
say
beyond
this
that
since
i
first
met
you
at
the
door
across
there
a
year
ago
you
have
taught
me
ever
since
what
love
means
and
now
i
am
come
to
you
as
to
my
dear
mistress
with
my
lesson
learnt
they
were
standing
together
now
he
was
still
turned
a
little
away
from
her
and
dared
not
lift
his
eyes
to
her
face
again
then
of
a
sudden
he
felt
her
hand
on
his
arm
for
a
moment
and
he
looked
up
and
saw
her
eyes
all
swimming
with
sorrow
dear
friend
she
said
quite
simply
it
is
impossible
ah
what
can
i
say
give
me
a
moment
more
he
said
and
they
walked
on
slowly
i
know
what
presumption
this
is
but
i
will
not
spin
phrases
about
that
nor
do
i
ask
what
is
impossible
but
i
will
only
ask
leave
to
teach
you
in
my
turn
what
love
means
oh
that
is
the
hardest
of
all
to
say
she
said
but
i
know
already
he
did
not
quite
understand
and
glanced
at
her
a
moment
i
once
loved
too
she
whispered
he
drew
a
sharp
breath
forgive
me
he
said
i
forced
that
from
you
you
are
never
anything
but
courteous
and
kind
she
said
and
that
makes
this
harder
than
all
they
walked
in
silence
half
a
dozen
steps
have
i
distressed
you
he
asked
glancing
at
her
again
then
she
looked
full
in
his
face
and
her
eyes
were
overflowing
i
am
grieved
for
your
sorrow
she
said
and
at
my
own
unworthiness
you
know
that
i
know
that
you
are
now
and
always
will
be
my
dear
mistress
and
queen
his
voice
broke
altogether
as
he
ended
and
he
bent
and
took
her
hand
delicately
in
his
own
as
if
it
were
royal
and
kissed
it
then
she
gave
a
great
sob
and
slipped
away
through
the
opening
in
the
clipped
hedge
and
he
was
left
alone
with
the
dusk
and
his
sorrow
a
week
later
anthony
and
isabel
were
saying
to
him
in
the
early
summer
morning
the
had
started
on
before
and
there
were
just
the
two
at
the
low
oak
door
with
the
behind
when
buxton
had
put
isabel
into
the
saddle
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
anthony
was
mounting
behind
mistress
isabel
he
whispered
forgive
me
but
i
find
i
can
not
take
your
answer
you
will
remember
that
she
shook
her
head
without
speaking
but
dared
not
even
look
into
his
eyes
though
she
turned
her
head
as
she
rode
out
of
the
gates
for
a
last
look
at
the
peaked
gables
and
low
windows
of
the
house
where
she
had
been
so
happy
there
was
still
the
dark
figure
motionless
against
the
pale
oak
door
oh
anthony
she
whispered
brokenly
our
lord
asks
very
much
chapter
vii
northern
religion
the
northern
counties
were
distinguished
among
all
in
england
for
their
loyalty
to
the
old
faith
and
this
was
owing
no
doubt
to
the
characters
of
both
the
country
and
the
inhabitants
it
was
difficult
for
the
officers
of
justice
to
penetrate
to
the
high
moorland
and
deep
ravines
and
yet
more
difficult
to
prevail
with
the
persons
who
lived
there
years
before
the
famous
lancashire
league
had
been
formed
under
the
encouragement
of
allen
afterwards
the
cardinal
whose
members
pledged
themselves
to
determined
recusancy
with
the
result
that
here
and
there
were
closed
and
the
book
of
common
prayer
utterly
refused
owing
partly
to
bishop
downman
laxity
towards
the
recusants
the
principles
of
the
league
had
retained
their
hold
throughout
the
county
ever
since
when
ten
obstinate
lancastrians
had
been
haled
before
the
council
of
whom
one
the
famous
sir
john
southworth
himself
suffered
imprisonment
more
than
once
anthony
and
isabel
then
found
their
life
in
the
north
very
different
to
that
which
they
had
been
living
at
stanfield
near
the
towns
of
course
precaution
was
as
necessary
as
anywhere
else
in
england
but
once
they
had
passed
up
on
to
the
higher
moorlands
they
were
able
to
throw
off
all
anxiety
as
much
as
if
the
penal
laws
of
england
were
not
in
force
there
it
was
pleasant
too
to
go
as
they
did
from
great
house
to
great
house
and
find
the
old
life
of
england
in
full
vigour
the
whole
family
present
at
mass
so
often
as
it
was
said
desirous
of
the
sacraments
and
thankful
for
the
opportunities
of
grace
that
the
arrival
of
the
priest
afforded
isabel
would
often
stay
at
such
houses
a
week
or
two
together
while
anthony
made
rounds
into
the
valleys
and
to
the
moorland
villages
and
then
the
two
would
travel
on
together
with
their
servants
to
the
next
village
anthony
ecclesiastical
outfit
was
very
simple
among
isabel
dresses
lay
a
brocade
vestment
that
might
easily
pass
notice
if
the
luggage
was
searched
and
anthony
carried
in
his
own
luggage
a
little
a
case
with
the
holy
oils
a
tiny
chalice
and
paten
and
a
thin
missal
and
ritual
in
one
volume
containing
the
order
of
mass
a
few
votive
masses
and
the
usual
benedictions
for
rue
and
the
like
and
the
occasional
offices
in
this
manner
they
first
visited
many
of
the
famous
old
lancashire
houses
some
of
which
still
stand
borwick
hall
lydiate
hall
thurnham
blainscow
where
campion
had
once
been
so
nearly
taken
and
others
all
of
which
were
provided
with
secret
for
the
escape
of
the
priest
should
a
sudden
alarm
be
raised
in
none
of
them
however
did
he
find
the
same
elaboration
of
device
as
at
stanfield
place
first
however
they
went
to
speke
hall
the
home
of
norreys
on
the
banks
of
the
mersey
a
beautiful
house
of
magpie
architecture
and
furnished
with
a
remarkable
underground
passage
to
the
shore
of
the
mersey
the
scene
of
richard
brittain
escape
here
they
received
a
very
warm
welcome
it
is
as
i
wrote
to
buxton
said
his
host
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
in
many
places
in
this
country
any
religion
other
than
the
catholic
is
unknown
the
belief
of
the
protestant
is
as
strange
as
that
of
the
turk
both
utterly
detested
i
was
in
cumberland
a
few
months
back
there
in
more
than
one
village
the
old
worship
goes
on
as
it
has
done
since
christianity
first
came
to
this
island
but
i
hope
you
will
go
up
there
now
that
you
have
come
so
far
you
would
do
a
great
work
for
christ
his
church
he
told
him
too
a
number
of
stories
of
the
zeal
and
constancy
shown
on
behalf
of
the
religion
of
small
squires
who
were
completely
ruined
by
the
fines
laid
upon
them
of
old
halls
that
were
falling
to
pieces
through
the
ruin
brought
upon
their
staunch
owners
and
above
all
of
the
priests
that
lancashire
had
added
to
the
roll
of
the
martyrs
anderton
marsden
and
thompson
among
others
and
of
the
joy
shown
when
the
glorious
news
of
their
victory
over
death
reached
the
place
where
they
had
been
born
or
where
they
had
ministered
at
preston
he
said
when
the
news
of
greenaway
death
reached
them
they
tolled
the
bells
for
sorrow
but
his
old
mother
ran
from
her
house
to
the
street
when
they
had
broken
the
news
to
her
them
peal
them
she
cried
i
have
borne
a
martyr
to
god
he
talked
too
of
campion
of
his
sermons
on
the
king
who
went
a
journey
and
the
hail
mary
and
told
him
of
the
escape
at
blainscow
hall
where
the
seeing
the
pursuivants
at
hand
pushed
the
jesuit
with
quick
wit
and
courage
into
the
so
that
he
came
out
disguised
indeed
in
green
mud
and
was
mocked
at
by
the
very
officers
as
a
clumsy
suitor
of
maidens
anthony
heart
warmed
within
him
as
he
sat
and
listened
to
these
tales
of
patience
and
gallantry
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
serve
such
folk
he
said
and
isabel
looked
with
eyes
from
the
one
to
the
other
they
did
not
stay
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
speke
hall
for
as
norreys
said
the
necessaries
of
salvation
were
to
be
had
there
already
but
they
moved
on
almost
at
once
northwards
always
arriving
at
some
central
point
for
saturdays
and
sundays
so
that
the
catholics
round
could
come
in
for
shrift
and
housel
in
this
manner
they
passed
up
through
lancashire
and
pushed
still
northwards
hearing
that
a
priest
was
sorely
needed
through
the
corner
of
westmoreland
up
the
lake
country
through
into
cumberland
itself
at
kendal
where
they
stayed
two
nights
anthony
received
a
message
that
determined
him
after
consultation
with
isabel
to
push
on
as
far
as
skiddaw
and
to
make
that
the
extreme
limit
of
his
journey
he
sent
the
messenger
a
back
with
a
verbal
answer
to
that
effect
and
named
a
date
when
they
would
arrive
it
was
already
dark
two
weeks
later
when
they
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
guide
was
to
meet
them
as
they
had
lost
their
way
more
than
once
already
here
were
a
couple
of
men
with
torches
waiting
for
them
behind
a
rock
who
had
come
down
from
the
village
a
mile
farther
on
to
bring
them
up
the
difficult
stony
path
that
was
the
only
means
of
access
to
it
the
track
went
up
a
ravine
with
a
rising
on
their
left
on
which
the
light
of
the
torches
shone
and
tumbled
ground
covered
with
heather
falling
rapidly
away
on
their
right
down
to
a
gulf
of
darkness
whence
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
torrent
far
below
the
path
was
uneven
with
great
stones
here
and
there
and
sharp
corners
in
it
and
as
they
went
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
their
tired
horses
from
stumbling
for
a
slip
would
have
been
dangerous
under
the
circumstances
the
men
who
led
them
said
little
as
it
was
impossible
for
a
horse
and
a
man
to
walk
abreast
but
anthony
was
astonished
to
see
again
and
again
as
they
turned
a
corner
another
man
with
a
torch
and
some
weapon
a
pike
or
a
sword
start
up
and
salute
him
or
sometimes
a
group
with
barefooted
boys
and
then
attach
themselves
to
the
procession
either
before
or
behind
until
in
a
short
while
there
was
an
escort
of
some
thirty
or
forty
accompanying
the
cavalcade
at
last
as
they
turned
a
corner
the
lighted
windows
of
a
belfry
showed
against
the
dark
moor
beyond
and
in
a
moment
more
as
if
there
were
a
watcher
set
there
to
look
out
for
the
torches
a
peal
of
five
bells
clashed
out
from
the
tower
then
as
they
rose
yet
higher
the
path
took
a
sudden
turn
and
a
dip
between
two
towering
rocks
and
the
whole
village
lay
beneath
them
with
lights
in
every
window
to
welcome
the
priest
the
first
that
they
had
seen
for
eight
months
when
the
old
marian
rector
the
elder
brother
of
the
squire
had
died
it
was
now
late
so
anthony
and
isabel
were
conducted
immediately
to
the
hall
an
old
house
immediately
adjoining
the
churchyard
and
here
too
the
windows
were
blazing
with
welcome
and
the
tall
squire
brian
with
his
wife
and
children
behind
was
standing
before
the
bright
at
the
top
of
the
steps
the
men
and
boys
that
had
brought
them
so
far
and
were
standing
in
the
little
court
with
their
torches
uplifted
now
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
to
receive
the
blessing
before
they
went
home
and
anthony
blessed
them
and
thanked
them
and
went
indoors
with
his
sister
strangely
moved
and
uplifted
the
two
following
days
were
full
of
hard
work
and
delight
for
anthony
he
was
to
say
mass
at
six
next
morning
and
came
out
of
the
house
a
little
after
six
the
sun
was
just
rising
to
his
right
over
a
shoulder
of
skiddaw
which
dominated
the
eastern
horizon
and
all
round
him
stretched
against
the
sky
in
all
directions
were
the
high
purple
moors
in
the
strange
immediately
in
front
of
him
not
thirty
yards
away
stood
the
church
with
its
tower
two
aisles
and
a
chapel
on
a
little
promontory
of
rock
which
jutted
out
over
the
bed
of
the
torrent
along
which
he
had
climbed
the
night
before
and
to
his
left
lay
the
straggling
street
of
the
village
all
was
perfectly
still
except
for
the
dash
of
the
stream
over
the
rocks
but
from
one
or
two
houses
a
thin
skein
of
smoke
was
rising
straight
into
the
air
anthony
stood
rapt
in
delight
and
drew
long
breaths
of
the
cool
morning
air
laden
with
freshness
and
fragrant
with
the
mellow
scent
of
the
heather
and
the
autumnal
smells
he
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
when
he
entered
the
church
for
for
the
first
time
since
he
could
remember
he
saw
an
english
church
in
its
true
glory
it
had
been
built
for
a
of
but
for
some
reason
had
never
been
used
as
that
and
had
become
simply
the
parish
church
of
the
village
across
the
centre
and
the
northern
aisle
ran
an
elaborate
screen
painted
in
rich
colours
and
the
southern
chapel
which
ran
eastwards
of
the
porch
was
separated
in
a
similar
way
from
the
rest
of
the
church
over
the
central
screen
was
the
great
rood
with
its
attendant
figures
exquisitely
carved
and
painted
in
every
direction
as
anthony
looked
beyond
the
screens
gleamed
rich
windows
with
figures
and
armorial
bearings
here
and
there
tattered
banners
hung
on
the
walls
christopher
stood
on
the
north
wall
opposite
the
door
to
guard
from
violence
all
who
looked
upon
him
day
by
day
a
little
painting
of
the
baptist
hung
on
a
pillar
over
against
the
font
and
a
vernacle
by
the
pulpit
and
all
round
the
walls
hung
little
pictures
that
the
poor
and
unlearned
might
read
the
story
of
redemption
there
but
the
chief
glory
of
all
was
the
solemn
high
altar
with
its
riddells
surmounted
by
gilded
angels
with
its
brocade
cloth
and
its
painted
halpas
behind
and
above
it
before
the
rich
window
which
smouldered
against
the
dawn
hung
the
awful
pyx
covered
by
the
white
silk
cloth
but
empty
waiting
for
the
priest
to
come
and
bid
the
shechinah
of
the
lord
to
brood
there
again
over
this
gorgeous
throne
beneath
against
the
brilliant
halo
of
the
painted
glass
behind
anthony
knelt
a
moment
and
thanked
god
for
bringing
him
here
and
then
passed
up
into
the
north
aisle
where
the
image
of
the
mother
of
god
presided
as
she
had
done
for
three
hundred
years
over
her
little
altar
against
the
wall
anthony
said
his
preparation
and
vested
at
the
altar
and
was
astonished
to
find
at
least
thirty
people
to
hear
mass
none
of
course
made
their
communion
but
anthony
when
he
had
ended
placed
the
body
of
the
lord
once
more
in
the
hanging
pyx
and
lit
the
lamp
before
it
then
all
day
he
sat
in
the
north
chapel
with
the
dash
and
loud
thunder
of
the
mountain
stream
entering
through
the
opened
panes
of
the
east
window
and
the
stained
sunlight
in
gorgeous
colours
creeping
across
the
red
tiles
at
his
feet
glowing
and
fading
as
the
clouds
moved
over
the
sun
while
the
people
came
and
were
shriven
with
the
exception
of
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
half
an
hour
for
supper
in
the
evening
he
was
incessantly
occupied
until
nine
at
night
from
the
upland
dales
all
round
they
streamed
in
at
news
of
the
priest
and
those
who
had
come
from
far
and
were
fasting
he
communicated
at
once
from
the
reserved
sacrament
at
last
tired
out
but
intensely
happy
he
went
back
to
the
hall
but
the
next
morning
was
yet
more
startling
mass
was
at
eight
and
by
the
time
anthony
entered
the
church
he
found
a
congregation
of
nearly
two
hundred
souls
the
village
itself
did
not
number
above
seventy
but
many
came
in
from
the
country
round
and
some
had
stayed
all
night
in
the
then
too
he
heard
the
singing
in
the
old
way
all
the
mass
music
was
sung
in
three
parts
except
the
unchanging
melody
of
the
creed
which
like
the
tremendous
and
unchanging
words
themselves
at
one
time
had
united
the
whole
of
england
but
what
stirred
anthony
more
than
all
were
the
ancient
hymns
sung
here
and
there
during
the
service
some
in
latin
which
a
few
picked
voices
rendered
and
some
in
english
to
the
old
lilting
tunes
which
were
as
much
the
growth
of
the
as
the
heather
itself
the
ave
verum
corpus
was
sung
after
the
elevation
and
anthony
felt
that
his
heart
would
break
for
very
joy
as
he
bent
before
the
body
of
his
lord
and
the
voices
behind
him
rose
and
exulted
up
the
aisles
the
women
and
voices
soaring
passionately
up
in
the
melody
the
mellow
men
voices
establishing
as
it
seemed
these
ecstatic
pinnacles
of
song
on
mighty
and
immovable
foundations
vespers
were
said
at
three
after
baptisms
and
more
confessions
and
anthony
was
astonished
at
the
number
of
folk
who
could
answer
the
priest
after
vespers
he
made
a
short
sermon
and
told
the
people
something
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
south
of
the
martyrdoms
at
tyburn
and
of
the
constancy
of
the
confessors
thou
faithful
unto
death
he
said
so
our
saviour
bids
us
and
he
gives
us
a
promise
too
will
give
thee
a
crown
of
life
beloved
some
day
the
tide
of
heresy
will
creep
up
these
valleys
too
and
it
will
bear
many
things
with
it
the
scaffold
and
the
gallows
and
the
knife
maybe
and
then
our
lord
will
see
which
are
his
then
will
be
the
time
that
grace
will
triumph
that
those
who
have
used
the
sacraments
with
devotion
that
have
been
careful
and
penitent
with
their
sins
that
have
hungered
for
the
bread
of
life
the
lord
shall
stand
by
them
and
save
them
as
he
stood
by
sherwin
on
the
rack
and
father
campion
on
the
scaffold
and
mistress
ward
and
many
more
of
whom
i
have
not
had
time
to
tell
you
he
who
bids
us
be
faithful
himself
will
be
faithful
and
he
who
wore
the
crown
of
thorns
will
bestow
upon
us
the
crown
of
life
then
they
sang
a
hymn
to
our
lady
hail
be
thou
mary
the
mother
of
christ
and
the
old
swaying
tune
rocked
like
a
cradle
and
the
people
looked
up
towards
their
mother
altar
as
they
sang
their
mother
who
had
ruled
them
so
sweetly
and
so
long
and
entreated
her
in
their
hearts
who
stood
by
her
son
cross
to
stand
by
theirs
too
should
god
ever
call
them
to
die
upon
one
the
next
day
brian
took
anthony
a
long
walk
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
across
the
moors
towards
the
north
side
of
skiddaw
anthony
found
the
old
man
a
delightful
and
garrulous
companion
full
of
tales
of
the
countryside
historical
religious
naturalistic
and
supernatural
as
they
stood
on
a
little
eminence
and
looked
back
to
where
the
pricked
out
of
the
deep
crack
in
the
moors
where
it
stood
he
told
him
the
tale
of
the
coming
of
the
pursuivants
they
first
troubled
us
in
he
said
they
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
before
to
disturb
themselves
for
one
old
man
like
my
brother
who
was
like
to
die
soon
but
in
april
of
that
year
they
first
sent
up
their
men
but
it
was
only
a
pair
of
pursuivants
for
they
knew
nothing
of
the
people
they
came
up
the
poor
men
to
take
my
brother
down
to
cockermouth
to
answer
on
his
religion
to
some
bench
of
ministers
that
sat
there
well
they
met
him
in
his
cassock
and
square
cap
coming
out
of
the
church
where
he
had
just
replaced
the
most
holy
sacrament
after
giving
communion
to
a
dying
body
are
you
the
minister
say
they
i
am
the
priest
if
that
is
what
you
mean
he
answers
back
he
was
a
large
man
like
myself
was
my
brother
come
old
man
say
they
must
help
you
down
to
cockermouth
well
a
few
words
passed
and
the
end
was
that
he
called
out
to
tim
who
lived
just
against
the
church
and
told
them
what
was
forward
well
the
pursuivants
got
back
to
cockermouth
with
their
lives
but
not
much
else
and
reported
to
the
magistrates
that
the
wild
irish
themselves
were
little
piminy
maids
compared
to
the
folk
they
had
visited
that
day
so
there
was
a
great
and
a
deal
of
talk
and
in
the
next
month
they
sent
up
thirty
pikemen
with
an
officer
and
a
dozen
pursuivants
and
all
to
take
one
old
priest
and
his
brother
i
had
been
in
kendal
in
april
when
they
first
came
but
they
put
it
all
down
to
me
well
we
were
ready
for
them
this
time
the
bells
had
been
ringing
to
call
in
the
folk
since
six
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
and
by
when
the
soldiers
were
expected
there
was
a
matter
of
two
hundred
men
i
should
say
some
with
scythes
and
sickles
and
some
with
staves
or
shepherds
crooks
the
children
had
been
sent
down
sooner
to
stone
the
men
all
the
way
up
the
path
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
reached
the
churchyard
gate
there
was
not
a
man
of
them
but
had
a
cut
or
a
bruise
upon
him
then
when
they
turned
the
corner
black
with
wrath
there
were
the
lads
gathered
about
the
each
with
his
weapon
and
each
white
and
silent
waiting
for
what
should
fall
now
you
wonder
where
we
were
we
were
in
the
church
my
brother
and
i
for
our
people
had
put
us
there
against
our
will
to
keep
us
safe
they
said
eh
but
i
was
wroth
when
olroyd
and
the
rest
pushed
me
through
the
door
however
there
we
were
locked
in
i
was
up
in
one
window
and
my
brother
was
in
the
belfry
as
i
thought
each
trying
to
see
what
was
forward
i
saw
the
two
crowds
of
them
silent
and
wrathful
with
not
twenty
yards
between
them
and
a
few
stones
still
sailing
among
the
soldiers
now
and
again
the
pikes
were
being
set
in
array
and
our
lads
were
opening
out
to
let
the
scythes
have
free
play
when
on
a
sudden
i
heard
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
round
the
outside
of
the
tower
and
i
climbed
down
from
my
place
and
up
again
to
one
of
the
west
windows
there
was
a
fearsome
hush
outside
now
and
i
could
see
some
of
the
soldiers
in
front
were
uneasy
they
had
their
eyes
off
the
lads
and
round
the
side
of
the
tower
and
then
i
saw
little
dickie
olroyd
in
his
surplice
ringing
a
bell
and
bearing
a
candle
and
behind
him
came
my
brother
in
a
purple
cope
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
before
with
his
square
cap
and
a
great
book
and
his
eyes
shining
out
of
his
head
and
his
lips
opening
and
mouthing
out
latin
and
then
he
stopped
laid
the
book
reverently
on
a
tombstone
lifted
both
hands
and
brought
them
down
with
the
fingers
out
and
his
eyes
larger
than
ever
i
could
see
the
soldiers
were
ready
to
break
and
scatter
for
some
were
catholics
no
doubt
and
many
more
feared
the
priest
and
then
on
a
sudden
my
brother
caught
the
candle
out
of
hand
blew
it
out
with
a
great
puff
while
dickie
rattled
upon
the
bell
and
then
he
dashed
the
smoking
candle
among
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
broke
and
fled
like
hares
out
of
the
churchyard
down
the
street
and
down
the
path
to
cockermouth
the
officer
tried
to
stay
them
but
was
no
use
the
fear
of
the
church
was
upon
them
and
her
grace
herself
could
not
have
prevailed
with
them
well
when
they
let
us
out
the
lads
were
all
too
for
my
brother
face
they
said
was
like
the
destroying
angel
and
i
was
somewhat
queer
myself
and
i
was
astonished
too
for
he
was
was
my
brother
and
would
not
hurt
a
body
much
less
damn
his
soul
and
after
all
the
poor
soldiers
were
not
to
blame
and
was
a
queer
cursing
i
thought
too
to
be
done
like
that
but
maybe
was
a
new
papal
method
i
went
round
to
the
north
chapel
and
there
he
was
taking
off
his
cope
he
said
to
me
did
i
do
it
it
i
said
it
why
you
damned
those
poor
lads
souls
eternally
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
with
you
i
said
them
said
he
was
only
your
old
herbal
that
i
read
at
them
and
the
cope
too
was
inside
out
then
the
old
man
told
anthony
other
stories
of
his
earlier
life
how
he
had
been
educated
at
the
university
and
been
at
court
in
king
reign
and
queen
mary
but
that
he
had
lost
heart
at
accession
and
retired
to
his
hills
where
he
could
serve
god
according
to
his
conscience
and
study
god
works
too
for
he
was
a
keen
naturalist
he
told
anthony
many
stories
about
the
deer
and
the
herds
of
wild
white
hornless
cattle
that
were
now
practically
extinct
on
the
hills
and
of
a
curious
breed
of
sheep
skulls
of
all
of
which
species
hung
in
his
hall
and
of
the
odd
that
anthony
had
admired
the
day
before
there
was
one
especially
that
he
talked
much
of
a
buffalo
horn
on
three
silver
feet
fashioned
like
the
legs
of
an
armed
man
round
the
centre
was
a
filleting
inscribed
pugnat
contra
tres
perdet
and
there
was
a
cross
pat√©e
on
the
horn
and
two
other
inscriptions
extollere
cornu
in
and
bibat
me
adhuc
brian
told
him
it
had
been
brought
from
italy
by
his
grandfather
they
put
up
a
quantity
of
grouse
and
several
hares
as
they
walked
across
the
moor
one
of
the
hares
which
had
a
curious
patch
of
white
between
his
ears
like
a
little
startled
brian
so
much
that
he
exclaimed
aloud
crossed
himself
and
stood
a
little
pale
watching
the
hare
head
as
it
bobbed
and
swerved
among
the
heather
i
like
it
not
he
said
to
anthony
who
inquired
what
was
the
matter
satan
hath
appeared
under
some
such
form
to
many
in
history
joachimus
camerarius
who
wrote
natura
tells
i
think
a
story
of
a
hare
followed
by
a
fox
that
ran
across
the
path
of
a
young
man
who
was
riding
on
a
horse
and
who
started
in
pursuit
up
and
down
hills
and
dales
they
went
and
soon
the
fox
was
no
longer
there
and
the
hare
grew
larger
and
blacker
as
it
went
and
the
young
man
presently
saw
that
he
was
in
a
country
that
he
knew
not
it
was
all
barren
and
desolate
round
him
and
the
sky
grew
dark
then
he
spurred
his
horse
more
furiously
and
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
great
hare
that
now
skipped
along
like
a
stag
before
him
and
then
as
he
put
out
his
hand
to
cut
the
hare
down
the
creature
sprang
into
the
air
and
vanished
and
the
horse
fell
dead
and
the
man
was
found
in
his
own
meadow
by
his
friends
in
a
swound
with
his
horse
dead
beside
him
and
trampled
marks
round
and
round
the
field
and
the
of
what
seemed
like
a
great
tiger
beside
him
where
the
beast
had
sprung
into
the
air
when
brian
found
that
anthony
was
interested
in
such
stories
he
told
him
plenty
of
them
especially
tales
that
seemed
to
join
in
a
strange
unity
of
life
demons
beasts
and
men
it
was
partly
no
doubt
his
studies
as
a
naturalist
that
led
him
to
insist
upon
points
that
united
rather
than
divided
the
orders
of
creation
and
he
told
him
stories
first
from
such
writers
as
michael
verdunus
and
petrus
burgottus
who
relate
among
other
marvels
how
there
are
ointments
by
the
use
of
which
shepherds
have
been
known
to
change
themselves
into
wolves
and
tear
the
sheep
that
they
should
have
protected
and
he
quoted
to
him
augustine
own
testimony
to
the
belief
that
in
italy
certain
women
were
able
to
change
themselves
into
heifers
through
the
power
of
witchcraft
finally
he
told
him
one
or
two
tales
of
his
own
experience
in
the
year
he
said
before
my
marriage
i
was
living
alone
in
the
hall
i
was
a
young
man
and
did
my
best
to
fear
nought
but
deadly
sin
i
was
coming
back
late
from
threlkeld
round
the
south
of
skiddaw
that
you
see
over
there
and
was
going
with
a
lantern
for
it
would
be
ten
at
night
and
the
time
of
year
was
autumn
i
was
still
a
mile
or
two
from
the
house
and
was
saying
my
beads
as
i
came
for
i
hold
that
is
a
great
protection
when
i
heard
a
strange
whistling
noise
with
a
murmur
in
it
high
up
overhead
in
the
night
is
the
birds
going
south
i
said
to
myself
for
you
know
that
great
flocks
fly
by
night
when
the
cold
begins
to
set
in
but
the
sound
grew
louder
and
more
distinct
and
at
last
i
could
hear
the
sound
as
of
words
gabbled
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
i
knew
they
were
no
birds
though
maybe
they
had
wings
like
them
but
i
knew
that
a
christened
soul
in
grace
has
nought
to
fear
from
hell
so
i
crossed
myself
and
said
my
beads
and
kept
my
eyes
on
the
ground
and
presently
i
saw
my
lights
burning
in
the
house
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
stream
and
the
gabbling
above
me
ceased
as
the
sound
of
the
running
water
began
but
that
night
i
awoke
again
and
again
and
the
night
seemed
hot
and
close
each
time
as
if
a
storm
was
near
but
there
was
no
thunder
each
time
i
heard
the
roar
of
the
stream
below
the
house
and
no
more
at
last
towards
the
morning
i
set
my
window
wide
that
looks
towards
the
stream
and
leaned
out
and
there
beneath
me
crowded
against
the
wall
of
the
house
as
i
could
see
in
the
growing
light
was
a
great
flock
of
sheep
with
all
their
heads
together
towards
the
house
as
close
as
a
score
of
dogs
could
pack
them
and
they
were
all
still
as
death
and
their
backs
were
dripping
wet
for
they
had
come
down
the
hills
and
swum
the
stream
in
order
to
be
near
a
christened
man
and
away
from
what
was
abroad
that
night
my
shepherds
told
me
the
same
that
day
that
everywhere
the
sheep
had
come
down
to
the
houses
as
if
terrified
near
to
death
and
at
keswick
whither
i
went
the
next
they
told
me
the
same
tale
and
that
two
men
had
each
found
a
sheep
that
could
not
travel
one
had
a
broken
leg
and
the
other
had
been
cast
but
neither
had
another
mark
or
wound
or
any
disease
upon
him
but
that
both
were
lying
dead
upon
skiddaw
and
the
look
in
the
dead
eyes
they
said
was
fit
to
make
a
man
forget
his
manhood
anthony
found
the
old
man
the
most
interesting
companion
possible
and
he
persuaded
him
to
accompany
him
on
several
of
the
expeditions
that
he
had
to
make
to
the
hamlets
and
outlying
cottages
round
in
his
spiritual
ministrations
and
both
he
and
isabel
were
sincerely
sorry
when
two
sundays
had
passed
away
and
they
had
to
begin
to
move
south
again
in
their
journeyings
and
so
the
autumn
passed
and
winter
began
and
anthony
was
slowly
moving
down
again
supplying
the
place
of
priests
who
had
fallen
sick
or
had
died
visiting
many
almost
inaccessible
hamlets
and
everywhere
encouraging
the
waverers
and
seeking
the
wanderers
and
rejoicing
over
the
courageous
and
bringing
opportunities
of
grace
to
many
who
longed
for
them
he
met
many
other
priests
from
time
to
time
and
took
counsel
with
them
but
did
not
have
time
to
become
very
intimate
with
any
of
them
so
great
were
the
demands
upon
his
services
in
this
manner
he
met
john
colleton
the
canonist
who
had
returned
from
his
banishment
in
but
found
him
a
little
dull
and
melancholy
though
his
devotion
was
beyond
praise
he
met
too
the
jesuit
fathers
edward
oldcorne
and
richard
holtby
the
former
of
whom
had
lately
come
from
hindlip
he
spent
christmas
near
and
after
the
new
year
had
opened
crossed
the
ken
once
more
near
beetham
and
began
to
return
slowly
down
the
coast
everywhere
he
was
deeply
touched
by
the
devotion
of
the
people
who
in
spite
of
long
months
without
a
priest
had
yet
clung
to
the
observance
of
their
religion
so
far
as
was
possible
and
now
welcomed
him
like
an
angel
of
god
and
he
had
the
great
happiness
too
of
reconciling
some
who
yielding
to
loneliness
and
pressure
had
conformed
to
the
establishment
in
these
latter
cases
he
was
almost
startled
by
the
depth
of
catholic
convictions
that
had
survived
i
never
believed
it
father
said
a
young
squire
to
him
near
garstang
i
knew
that
it
was
but
a
human
invention
and
not
the
gospel
that
my
fathers
held
and
that
christ
our
saviour
brought
on
earth
but
i
lost
heart
for
that
no
priest
came
near
us
and
i
had
not
had
the
sacraments
for
nearly
two
years
and
i
thought
that
it
were
better
to
have
some
religion
than
none
at
all
so
at
last
i
went
to
church
but
there
is
no
need
to
talk
to
me
father
now
i
have
made
my
confession
for
i
know
with
my
whole
soul
that
the
catholic
religion
is
the
true
one
and
i
have
known
it
all
the
while
and
i
thank
god
and
his
blessed
mother
and
you
father
too
for
helping
me
to
say
so
again
and
to
come
back
to
grace
at
last
at
the
beginning
of
march
anthony
and
isabel
found
themselves
back
again
at
speke
hall
warmly
welcomed
by
norreys
you
have
done
a
good
work
for
the
church
capell
said
his
host
and
god
will
reward
you
and
thank
you
for
it
himself
for
we
can
not
and
i
thank
god
said
anthony
for
the
encouragement
to
faith
that
the
sight
of
the
faithful
north
has
given
to
me
and
pray
him
that
i
may
carry
something
of
her
spirit
back
with
me
to
the
south
there
were
letters
waiting
for
him
at
speke
hall
one
from
buxton
urging
them
to
come
back
at
least
for
the
present
to
stanfield
place
so
soon
as
the
winter
work
in
the
north
was
over
and
another
from
the
rector
of
the
college
at
douai
to
the
same
effect
there
was
also
one
more
written
from
a
little
parish
in
kent
from
a
catholic
lady
who
was
altogether
a
stranger
to
him
but
who
plainly
knew
all
about
him
entreating
him
to
call
at
her
house
when
he
was
in
the
south
again
her
husband
she
said
had
met
him
once
at
stanfield
and
had
been
strongly
attracted
by
him
to
the
catholic
church
and
she
believed
that
if
anthony
would
but
pay
them
a
visit
her
husband
conversion
would
be
brought
about
anthony
could
not
remember
the
man
name
but
isabel
thought
that
she
did
remember
some
such
person
at
a
small
private
conference
that
anthony
had
given
in
buxton
house
for
the
benefit
of
catholics
and
those
who
were
being
drawn
towards
the
religion
the
lady
too
gave
him
instructions
as
to
how
he
should
come
from
london
to
her
house
recommending
him
to
cross
the
thames
at
a
certain
spot
that
she
described
near
greenhithe
and
to
come
on
southwards
along
a
route
that
she
marked
for
him
to
the
parish
of
stanstead
where
she
lived
this
then
was
soon
arranged
and
after
letters
had
been
sent
off
announcing
anthony
movements
he
left
speke
hall
with
isabel
about
a
fortnight
later
chapter
viii
in
stanstead
woods
on
the
first
day
of
june
anthony
and
isabel
with
their
three
armed
servants
and
the
french
maid
behind
them
were
riding
down
through
thurrock
to
the
north
bank
of
the
thames
opposite
greenhithe
as
they
went
anthony
pulled
out
and
studied
the
letter
and
the
little
map
that
kirke
had
sent
to
guide
them
on
the
side
she
wrote
when
you
come
to
the
ferry
stands
a
little
inn
the
among
trees
with
a
yard
behind
it
bender
the
host
is
one
of
us
and
he
will
get
your
horses
on
board
and
do
all
things
to
forward
you
without
attracting
attention
give
him
some
sign
that
he
may
know
you
for
a
catholic
and
when
you
are
alone
with
him
tell
him
where
you
are
bound
there
were
one
or
two
houses
standing
near
the
bank
as
they
rode
down
the
lane
that
led
to
the
river
but
they
had
little
difficulty
in
identifying
the
sloop
and
presently
they
rode
into
the
yard
and
leaving
their
horses
with
the
servants
stepped
round
into
the
little
smoky
front
room
of
the
inn
a
man
dressed
somewhat
like
a
sailor
was
sitting
behind
a
table
who
looked
up
with
a
dull
kind
of
expectancy
and
whom
anthony
took
as
the
host
and
in
order
to
identify
him
and
show
who
he
himself
was
he
took
up
a
little
cake
of
bread
that
was
lying
on
a
platter
on
the
table
and
broke
it
as
if
he
would
eat
this
was
one
of
father
persons
devices
and
was
used
among
catholics
to
signify
their
religion
when
they
were
with
strangers
since
it
was
an
action
that
could
rouse
no
suspicion
among
others
the
man
looked
in
an
unintelligent
way
at
anthony
who
turned
away
and
rapped
upon
the
door
and
as
a
large
man
came
out
broke
it
again
and
put
a
piece
into
his
mouth
the
man
lifted
his
eyebrows
slightly
and
just
smiled
and
anthony
knew
he
had
found
his
friend
come
this
way
sir
he
said
and
your
good
lady
too
they
followed
him
into
the
inner
room
of
the
house
a
kind
of
little
kitchen
with
a
fire
burning
and
a
pot
over
it
and
one
or
two
barrels
of
drink
against
the
wall
a
woman
was
stirring
the
pot
for
it
was
near
and
turned
round
as
the
strangers
came
in
it
was
plainly
an
inn
that
was
of
the
poorest
kind
and
that
was
used
almost
entirely
by
watermen
or
by
travellers
who
were
on
their
way
to
cross
the
ferry
the
less
said
the
better
said
the
man
when
he
had
shut
the
door
how
can
i
serve
you
sir
we
wish
to
take
our
horses
and
ourselves
across
to
greenhithe
said
anthony
and
kirke
to
whom
we
are
going
bade
us
make
ourselves
known
to
you
the
man
nodded
and
smiled
yes
sir
that
can
be
managed
directly
the
ferry
is
at
the
other
bank
now
sir
and
i
will
call
it
across
shall
we
say
in
half
an
hour
sir
and
meanwhile
will
you
and
your
lady
take
something
anthony
accepted
gladly
as
the
time
was
getting
on
and
ordered
dinner
for
the
servants
too
in
the
outer
room
as
the
landlord
was
going
to
the
door
he
stopped
him
who
is
that
man
in
the
other
room
he
asked
the
landlord
gave
a
glance
at
the
door
and
came
back
towards
anthony
to
tell
the
truth
sir
i
do
not
know
he
is
a
sailor
by
appearance
and
he
knows
the
talk
but
none
of
the
watermen
know
him
and
he
seems
to
do
nothing
however
sir
there
no
harm
in
him
that
i
can
see
anthony
told
him
that
he
had
broken
the
bread
before
him
thinking
he
was
the
landlord
the
real
landlord
smiled
broadly
thank
god
i
am
somewhat
more
of
a
man
than
that
for
the
sailor
was
lean
and
then
once
more
bender
went
to
the
door
to
call
the
servants
in
why
the
man
gone
he
said
and
disappeared
then
they
heard
his
voice
again
but
he
left
his
groat
behind
him
for
his
drink
so
well
and
presently
his
voice
was
heard
singing
as
he
got
the
table
ready
for
the
servants
in
a
little
more
than
half
an
hour
the
party
and
the
horses
were
safely
on
the
broad
bargelike
ferry
and
bender
was
bowing
on
the
bank
and
wishing
them
a
prosperous
journey
as
they
began
to
move
out
on
to
the
wide
river
towards
the
chalk
cliffs
and
red
roofs
of
greenhithe
that
nestled
among
the
mass
of
trees
on
the
opposite
bank
in
less
than
ten
minutes
they
were
at
the
pier
and
after
a
little
struggle
to
get
the
horses
to
land
they
were
mounted
and
riding
up
the
straight
little
street
that
led
up
to
the
higher
ground
just
before
they
turned
the
corner
they
heard
far
away
across
the
river
the
horn
blown
to
summon
the
once
more
there
were
two
routes
from
greenhithe
to
stanstead
the
one
to
the
right
through
longfield
and
ash
the
other
to
the
left
through
southfleet
and
nursted
there
was
very
little
to
choose
between
them
as
regards
distance
and
kirke
had
drawn
a
careful
with
a
few
notes
as
to
the
characteristics
of
each
route
there
were
besides
particularly
through
the
thick
woods
about
stanstead
itself
innumerable
intersecting
one
another
in
all
directions
the
travellers
had
decided
at
the
inn
to
take
the
road
through
longfield
since
in
spite
of
other
disadvantages
it
was
the
less
frequented
of
the
two
and
they
were
anxious
above
all
things
to
avoid
attention
their
horses
were
tired
and
as
they
had
plenty
of
time
before
them
they
proposed
to
go
at
a
all
the
way
and
to
take
between
two
and
three
hours
to
cover
the
nine
or
ten
miles
between
greenhithe
and
stanstead
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
as
they
passed
through
fawkham
and
it
was
delightful
to
pass
from
the
white
road
in
under
the
thick
arching
trees
just
beyond
the
village
there
everything
was
cool
shadow
the
insects
sang
in
the
air
about
them
an
early
rabbit
or
two
cantered
across
the
road
and
disappeared
into
the
thick
undergrowth
once
the
song
of
the
birds
about
them
suddenly
ceased
and
through
an
opening
in
the
green
rustling
vault
overhead
they
saw
a
cruel
shape
with
motionless
wings
glide
steadily
across
they
did
not
talk
much
but
let
the
reins
lie
loose
and
enjoyed
the
cool
shadow
and
the
green
lights
and
the
fragrant
mellow
scents
of
the
woods
about
them
while
their
horses
slouched
along
on
the
turf
switching
their
tails
and
even
stopping
sometimes
for
a
second
in
a
kind
of
desperate
greediness
to
snatch
a
green
juicy
mouthful
at
the
side
isabel
was
thinking
of
stanfield
and
wondering
how
the
situation
would
adjust
itself
mary
corbet
would
be
there
she
knew
to
meet
them
and
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
she
could
consult
her
but
what
she
asked
herself
would
be
her
relations
with
the
master
of
the
house
suddenly
anthony
horse
stepped
off
the
turf
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
and
began
to
come
towards
her
and
she
moved
her
beast
a
little
to
let
him
come
on
the
turf
beside
her
isabel
said
anthony
tell
me
if
you
hear
anything
she
looked
at
him
suddenly
startled
no
no
he
said
there
is
nothing
to
fear
it
is
probably
my
fancy
but
listen
and
tell
me
she
listened
intently
there
was
the
creaking
of
her
own
saddle
the
soft
footfalls
of
the
horses
the
hum
of
the
summer
woods
and
the
sound
of
the
servants
horses
behind
no
she
said
there
is
nothing
beyond
there
he
said
suddenly
now
do
you
hear
it
then
she
heard
plainly
the
sound
either
of
a
man
running
or
of
a
horse
walking
somewhere
behind
them
yes
she
said
i
hear
something
but
what
of
it
it
is
the
third
time
i
have
heard
it
he
said
once
in
the
woods
behind
longfield
and
once
just
before
the
little
village
with
the
steepled
church
the
sound
had
ceased
again
it
is
some
one
who
has
come
nearly
all
the
way
from
greenhithe
behind
us
perhaps
they
are
not
following
but
again
they
she
said
there
is
only
one
there
are
three
he
answered
at
least
the
other
two
are
on
the
turf
at
the
side
but
just
before
the
village
i
heard
all
three
of
them
or
rather
certainly
more
than
two
when
they
were
between
those
two
walls
where
there
was
no
turf
isabel
was
staring
at
him
with
great
frightened
eyes
he
smiled
back
at
her
tranquilly
ah
isabel
he
said
there
is
nothing
really
to
fear
in
any
case
what
shall
you
do
she
asked
making
a
great
effort
to
control
herself
i
think
we
must
find
out
first
of
all
whether
they
are
after
us
we
must
certainly
not
ride
straight
to
the
manor
lodge
if
it
is
so
then
he
explained
his
plan
see
here
he
said
holding
the
map
before
her
as
he
rode
we
shall
come
to
fawkham
green
in
five
minutes
then
our
proper
road
leads
straight
on
to
ash
but
we
will
take
the
right
instead
towards
eynsford
meanwhile
i
will
leave
robert
here
hidden
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
see
who
these
men
are
and
what
they
look
like
and
we
will
ride
on
slowly
when
they
have
passed
he
will
come
out
and
take
the
road
we
should
have
taken
and
he
then
will
turn
off
to
the
right
too
before
he
reaches
ash
and
by
trotting
he
will
easily
come
up
with
us
at
this
corner
and
he
pointed
to
it
on
the
map
and
so
he
will
tell
us
what
kind
of
men
they
are
and
they
will
never
know
that
they
have
been
spied
upon
for
by
this
plan
he
will
not
have
to
pass
them
is
that
a
good
plot
and
he
smiled
at
her
isabel
assented
feeling
dazed
and
overwhelmed
she
could
hardly
bring
her
thoughts
to
a
focus
for
the
fears
that
had
hovered
about
her
ever
since
they
had
left
lancashire
and
come
down
to
the
treacherous
south
had
now
darted
upon
her
tearing
her
heart
with
terror
and
blinding
her
eyes
and
bewildering
her
with
the
beating
of
their
wings
anthony
quietly
called
up
robert
and
explained
the
plan
he
was
a
lad
of
a
catholic
family
at
great
keynes
perfectly
fearless
and
perfectly
devoted
to
the
church
and
to
the
priest
he
served
he
nodded
his
head
briskly
with
approval
as
the
plan
was
explained
of
course
it
may
all
be
nothing
ended
anthony
and
then
you
will
think
me
a
poor
fool
the
lad
grinned
cheerfully
no
sir
he
said
all
this
while
they
had
been
riding
slowly
on
together
and
now
the
wood
showed
signs
of
coming
to
an
end
so
anthony
told
the
groom
to
ride
fifty
yards
into
the
undergrowth
at
once
to
bandage
his
horse
eyes
and
to
tie
him
to
a
tree
and
then
to
creep
back
himself
near
the
road
so
as
to
see
without
being
seen
the
men
who
seemed
to
be
following
were
at
least
half
a
mile
behind
so
he
would
have
plenty
of
time
then
they
all
rode
on
together
again
leaving
robert
to
find
his
way
into
the
wood
as
they
went
isabel
began
to
question
her
brother
and
anthony
gave
her
his
views
they
have
not
come
up
with
us
because
they
know
we
are
four
men
to
three
if
as
i
think
they
are
not
more
than
three
that
is
one
reason
and
another
is
that
they
love
to
track
us
home
before
they
take
us
and
thus
take
our
hosts
too
as
priests
harbourers
now
plainly
these
men
do
not
know
where
we
are
bound
or
they
would
not
follow
us
so
closely
best
of
all
too
they
love
to
catch
us
at
mass
for
then
they
have
no
trouble
in
proving
their
case
i
think
then
that
they
will
not
try
to
take
us
till
we
reach
the
manor
lodge
and
we
must
do
our
best
to
shake
them
off
before
that
now
the
plot
i
have
thought
of
is
this
that
should
it
prove
as
i
think
it
will
we
should
ride
slower
than
ever
as
if
our
horses
were
weary
down
the
road
along
which
robert
will
have
come
after
he
has
joined
us
and
turn
down
as
if
to
go
to
kingsdown
and
when
we
have
gone
half
a
mile
and
are
well
round
that
sharp
corner
double
back
to
it
and
hide
all
in
the
wood
at
the
side
they
will
follow
our
tracks
and
there
are
no
houses
at
which
they
can
ask
and
there
seem
no
travellers
either
on
these
and
when
they
have
passed
us
we
double
back
at
the
gallop
and
down
the
next
turning
which
will
bring
us
in
a
couple
of
miles
to
stanstead
there
is
a
maze
of
roads
thereabouts
and
it
will
be
hard
if
we
do
not
shake
them
off
for
there
is
not
a
house
marked
upon
the
map
at
which
they
can
ask
after
us
isabel
did
her
utmost
to
understand
but
the
horror
of
the
pursuit
had
overwhelmed
her
the
quiet
woods
into
which
they
had
passed
again
after
leaving
fawkham
green
now
seemed
full
of
menace
the
rough
road
with
the
deep
powdery
ruts
and
the
grass
and
at
the
side
no
longer
seemed
a
pleasant
path
leading
home
but
a
treacherous
device
to
lead
them
deeper
into
danger
the
creatures
round
them
the
rabbits
the
pigeons
that
flapped
suddenly
out
of
all
the
tall
trees
the
tits
that
fluttered
on
and
chirped
and
fluttered
again
all
seemed
united
against
anthony
in
some
dreadful
league
anthony
himself
felt
all
his
powers
of
observation
and
device
quickened
and
established
he
had
lived
so
long
in
the
expectation
of
a
time
like
this
and
had
rehearsed
and
mastered
the
emotions
of
terror
and
suspense
so
often
that
he
was
ready
to
meet
them
and
gradually
his
entire
and
the
unmoved
tones
of
his
voice
and
his
serene
alert
face
prevailed
upon
isabel
and
by
the
time
that
they
slowly
turned
the
last
curve
and
saw
robert
on
his
black
horse
waiting
for
them
at
the
corner
her
sense
of
terror
and
bewilderment
had
passed
her
heart
had
ceased
that
sick
thumping
and
she
too
was
tranquil
and
capable
robert
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
beside
anthony
round
the
sharp
corner
to
the
left
up
the
road
along
which
he
had
trotted
just
now
there
are
three
of
them
sir
he
said
in
an
even
businesslike
voice
one
of
them
sir
on
a
brown
mare
but
i
could
see
aught
of
him
sir
he
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
track
the
second
is
like
a
groom
on
a
grey
horse
and
the
third
is
dressed
like
a
sailor
sir
on
a
brown
horse
a
sailor
said
anthony
a
lean
man
and
sunburnt
with
a
whistle
i
did
not
see
the
whistle
sir
but
he
is
as
you
say
this
made
it
certain
that
it
was
the
man
they
had
seen
in
the
inn
opposite
greenhithe
and
also
practically
certain
that
he
was
a
spy
for
nothing
that
anthony
had
done
could
have
roused
his
suspicions
except
the
breaking
of
the
bread
and
that
would
only
be
known
to
one
who
was
deep
in
the
counsels
of
the
catholics
all
this
made
the
pursuit
the
more
formidable
so
anthony
meditated
and
presently
calling
up
the
servants
behind
explained
the
situation
and
his
plan
the
french
maid
showed
signs
of
hysteria
and
isabel
had
to
take
her
aside
and
quiet
her
while
the
men
consulted
then
it
was
arranged
and
the
servants
presently
dropped
behind
again
a
few
yards
though
the
maid
still
rode
with
isabel
then
they
came
to
the
road
on
the
right
that
would
have
led
them
to
kingsdown
and
down
this
they
turned
as
they
went
anthony
kept
a
good
for
a
place
to
turn
aside
and
a
hundred
yards
from
the
turning
saw
what
he
wanted
on
the
side
a
little
path
led
into
the
wood
it
was
overgrown
with
brambles
and
looked
as
if
it
were
now
disused
anthony
gave
the
word
and
turned
his
horse
down
the
entrance
and
was
followed
in
single
file
by
the
others
there
were
thick
trees
about
them
on
every
side
and
what
was
far
more
important
the
road
they
had
left
at
this
point
ran
higher
than
usual
and
was
hard
and
dry
so
the
horses
hoofs
as
they
turned
off
left
no
mark
that
would
be
noticed
after
riding
thirty
or
forty
yards
anthony
stopped
turned
his
horse
again
and
forced
him
through
the
hazels
with
some
difficulty
and
the
others
again
followed
in
silence
through
the
passage
he
had
made
presently
anthony
stopped
the
branches
that
had
swished
their
faces
as
they
rode
through
now
seemed
a
little
higher
and
it
was
possible
to
sit
here
on
horseback
without
any
great
discomfort
i
must
see
them
myself
he
whispered
to
isabel
and
slipped
off
his
horse
giving
the
bridle
to
robert
oh
mon
dieu
moaned
the
maid
mon
dieu
ne
partez
pas
anthony
looked
at
her
severely
you
must
be
quiet
and
brave
he
said
sternly
you
are
a
catholic
too
pray
instead
of
crying
then
isabel
saw
him
slip
noiselessly
towards
the
road
which
was
some
fifty
yards
away
through
the
thick
growth
it
was
now
a
breathless
afternoon
high
overhead
the
sun
blazed
in
a
cloudless
sky
but
down
here
all
was
cool
green
shadow
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
from
the
woods
beyond
the
mellow
hum
of
the
flies
anthony
faint
rustlings
had
ceased
now
and
then
a
saddle
creaked
or
a
horse
blew
out
his
nostrils
or
tossed
his
head
one
of
the
men
wound
his
handkerchief
silently
round
a
piece
of
his
horse
that
jingled
a
little
the
maid
drew
a
soft
sobbing
breath
now
and
then
but
she
dared
not
speak
after
the
priest
rebuke
then
suddenly
there
came
another
sound
to
isabel
ears
she
could
not
distinguish
at
first
what
it
was
but
it
grew
nearer
and
presently
resolved
itself
into
the
fumbling
noise
of
several
horses
feet
walking
together
twice
or
three
times
a
stirrup
chinked
once
she
heard
a
muffled
cough
but
no
word
was
spoken
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
until
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
not
within
five
yards
of
her
her
heart
began
again
that
sick
thumping
a
fly
that
she
had
brushed
away
again
and
again
now
crawled
unheeded
over
her
face
and
even
on
her
white
parted
lips
but
a
sob
of
fear
from
the
maid
recalled
her
and
she
turned
a
sharp
look
of
warning
on
her
then
the
fumbling
noise
began
to
die
away
the
men
were
passing
there
was
something
in
their
silence
that
was
more
terrible
than
all
else
it
reminded
her
of
hounds
running
on
a
hot
scent
then
at
last
there
was
silence
then
gentle
rustlings
again
over
last
year
leaves
and
anthony
came
back
through
the
hazels
he
nodded
at
her
sharply
now
quickly
he
said
and
took
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
began
to
lead
him
out
again
the
way
they
had
come
at
the
entrance
he
looked
out
first
the
road
was
empty
and
silent
then
he
led
his
horse
clear
and
mounted
as
the
others
came
out
one
by
one
in
single
file
now
follow
close
and
watch
my
hand
he
said
and
he
put
his
horse
to
a
quick
walk
on
the
soft
wayside
turf
as
the
distance
widened
between
them
and
the
men
who
were
now
riding
away
from
them
the
walk
became
a
trot
and
then
quickly
a
canter
as
the
danger
of
the
sound
being
carried
to
their
pursuers
decreased
it
seemed
to
isabel
like
some
breathless
dream
as
she
followed
back
watching
the
motions
of
his
hand
as
he
signed
in
which
direction
he
was
going
to
turn
next
what
was
happening
she
half
wondered
to
herself
that
she
should
be
riding
like
this
on
a
spent
horse
as
if
in
some
dreadful
game
turning
abruptly
down
lanes
and
rides
out
across
the
high
road
and
down
again
another
turn
with
the
breathing
and
creaking
and
jingling
of
others
behind
her
years
ago
the
two
had
played
on
horseback
in
the
woods
above
great
keynes
she
remembered
this
now
and
a
flood
of
memories
poured
across
her
mind
and
diluted
the
bitterness
of
this
shocking
reality
dear
god
what
a
game
anthony
steered
with
skill
and
decision
he
had
been
studying
the
map
with
great
attention
and
even
now
carried
it
loose
in
his
hand
and
glanced
at
it
from
time
to
time
above
all
else
he
wished
to
avoid
passing
a
house
for
fear
that
the
searchers
might
afterwards
inquire
at
it
and
he
succeeded
perfectly
in
this
though
once
or
twice
he
was
obliged
to
retrace
his
steps
there
was
little
danger
he
knew
now
of
the
noise
of
the
horses
feet
being
any
guide
to
those
who
were
searching
for
the
high
on
which
they
rode
was
a
labyrinth
of
lanes
and
rides
and
the
trees
too
served
to
echo
and
confuse
the
noise
they
could
not
altogether
avoid
making
twice
they
passed
travellers
one
a
farmer
on
an
old
grey
horse
who
stared
at
this
strange
hurrying
party
and
once
a
pedlar
laden
with
his
pack
who
trudged
past
head
down
isabel
horse
was
beginning
to
strain
and
pant
and
she
herself
to
grow
giddy
with
heat
and
weariness
when
she
saw
through
the
trees
an
old
farmhouse
with
latticed
windows
and
a
great
external
chimney
standing
in
a
square
of
cultivated
ground
and
in
a
moment
more
the
path
they
were
following
turned
a
corner
and
the
party
drew
up
at
the
back
of
the
house
at
the
noise
of
the
horses
footsteps
a
door
at
the
back
had
opened
and
a
woman
face
looked
out
and
drew
back
again
and
presently
from
the
front
kirke
came
quickly
round
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
with
a
somewhat
anxious
face
but
a
look
of
great
relief
came
over
it
as
she
saw
anthony
thank
god
you
are
come
she
said
i
feared
something
had
happened
anthony
explained
the
circumstances
in
a
few
words
i
will
ride
on
gladly
madam
if
you
think
right
but
i
will
ask
you
in
any
case
to
take
my
sister
in
why
how
can
you
say
that
she
said
i
am
a
catholic
come
in
father
but
i
fear
there
is
but
poor
accommodation
for
the
servants
and
the
horses
asked
anthony
the
barn
at
the
back
is
got
ready
for
them
she
said
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
take
them
there
at
once
she
called
a
woman
and
sent
her
to
show
the
men
where
to
stable
the
horses
while
anthony
and
isabel
and
the
maid
dismounted
and
came
in
with
her
to
the
house
there
they
talked
over
the
situation
and
what
was
best
to
be
done
her
husband
had
ridden
over
to
wrotham
and
she
expected
him
back
for
supper
nothing
then
could
be
finally
settled
till
he
came
in
the
meantime
the
manor
lodge
was
probably
the
safest
place
in
all
the
woods
kirke
declared
the
nearest
house
was
half
a
mile
away
and
that
was
the
rectory
and
the
rector
himself
was
a
personal
friend
and
favourable
to
catholics
the
manor
lodge
too
stood
well
off
the
road
to
wrotham
and
not
five
strangers
appeared
there
in
the
year
fifty
men
might
hunt
the
woods
for
a
month
and
not
find
it
in
fact
kirke
had
taken
the
house
on
account
of
its
privacy
for
he
was
weary
his
wife
said
of
paying
her
fines
for
recusancy
and
still
more
unwilling
to
pay
his
own
when
that
happy
necessity
should
arrive
for
he
had
now
practically
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
catholic
and
only
needed
a
little
instruction
before
being
received
he
is
a
good
man
father
she
said
to
anthony
and
will
make
a
good
catholic
then
she
explained
about
the
accommodation
isabel
and
the
maid
would
have
to
sleep
together
in
the
spare
room
and
anthony
would
have
the
little
opening
out
of
it
and
the
men
she
feared
would
have
to
shake
down
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
loft
over
the
stable
in
the
barn
at
seven
kirke
arrived
and
when
the
situation
had
been
explained
to
him
he
acquiesced
in
the
plan
he
seemed
confident
that
there
was
but
little
danger
and
he
and
anthony
were
soon
deep
in
theological
talk
anthony
found
him
excellently
instructed
already
he
had
in
fact
even
prepared
for
his
confession
his
wife
had
taught
him
well
and
it
was
the
prospect
of
this
one
good
opportunity
of
being
reconciled
to
the
church
that
had
precipitated
matters
and
decided
him
to
take
the
step
he
was
a
delightful
companion
too
intelligent
courageous
humorous
and
modest
and
anthony
thought
his
own
labour
and
danger
well
repaid
when
a
little
after
midnight
he
heard
his
confession
and
received
him
into
the
church
it
was
impossible
for
kirke
to
receive
communion
as
he
had
wished
for
there
were
wanting
some
of
the
necessaries
for
saying
mass
so
he
promised
to
ride
across
to
stanfield
in
a
week
or
so
stay
the
night
and
communicate
in
the
morning
then
early
the
next
morning
a
council
was
held
as
to
the
best
way
for
the
party
to
leave
for
stanfield
the
men
were
called
up
and
their
opinions
asked
and
gradually
step
by
step
a
plan
was
evolved
the
first
requirement
was
that
if
possible
the
party
should
not
be
recognisable
the
second
that
they
should
keep
together
for
mutual
protection
for
to
separate
would
very
possibly
mean
the
apprehension
of
some
one
of
them
the
third
was
that
they
should
avoid
so
far
as
was
possible
villages
and
houses
and
frequented
roads
then
the
first
practical
suggestion
was
made
by
isabel
that
the
maid
should
be
left
behind
and
that
kirke
should
bring
her
on
with
him
to
stanfield
when
he
came
a
week
later
this
he
eagerly
accepted
and
further
offered
to
keep
all
the
luggage
they
could
spare
take
charge
of
the
men
liveries
and
lend
them
old
garments
and
hats
of
his
own
to
one
a
cloak
and
to
another
a
doublet
in
this
way
he
said
it
would
appear
to
be
a
pleasure
party
rather
than
one
of
travellers
and
should
they
be
followed
this
would
serve
to
cover
their
traces
the
travelling
by
unfrequented
roads
was
more
difficult
for
that
in
itself
might
attract
attention
should
they
actually
meet
any
one
anthony
who
had
been
thinking
in
silence
a
moment
or
two
now
broke
in
have
you
any
hawks
mr
kirke
he
asked
only
one
old
peregrine
he
said
past
sport
she
will
do
said
anthony
and
can
you
borrow
another
there
is
a
merlin
at
the
rectory
said
kirke
then
anthony
explained
his
plan
that
they
should
pose
as
a
isabel
and
robert
should
each
carry
a
hawk
while
he
himself
would
carry
on
his
wrist
an
empty
leash
and
hood
as
if
a
hawk
had
escaped
that
they
should
then
all
ride
together
over
the
open
country
avoiding
every
road
and
that
if
they
should
see
any
one
on
the
way
they
should
inquire
whether
he
had
seen
an
escaped
falcon
or
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
bells
and
this
would
enable
them
to
ask
the
way
should
it
be
necessary
without
arousing
suspicion
this
plan
was
accepted
and
the
maid
was
informed
to
her
great
relief
that
she
might
remain
behind
for
a
week
or
so
and
then
return
with
kirke
after
the
searchers
had
left
the
woods
it
was
a
ride
to
stanfield
and
it
was
thought
safer
on
the
whole
not
to
remain
any
longer
where
they
were
as
it
was
impossible
to
know
whether
a
shrewd
man
might
not
with
the
help
of
a
little
luck
stumble
upon
the
house
so
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
servants
had
changed
into
kirke
old
suits
and
the
merlin
had
been
borrowed
from
the
rectory
for
a
week
hawking
the
horses
were
brought
round
and
the
party
mounted
kirke
and
anthony
had
spent
a
long
morning
together
discussing
the
route
and
it
had
been
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
keep
along
the
high
ridge
due
west
until
they
were
a
little
beyond
kemsing
which
they
would
be
able
to
see
below
them
in
the
valley
and
then
to
strike
across
between
that
village
and
otford
and
keeping
almost
due
south
ride
up
through
knole
park
then
straight
down
on
the
other
side
into
the
weald
and
so
past
tonbridge
home
kirke
himself
insisted
on
accompanying
them
on
his
cob
until
he
had
seen
them
clear
of
the
woods
on
the
high
ground
both
he
and
his
wife
were
full
of
gratitude
to
anthony
for
the
risk
and
trouble
he
had
undergone
and
did
their
utmost
to
provide
them
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
their
disguise
at
last
about
two
the
five
men
and
isabel
rode
out
of
the
little
yard
at
the
back
of
the
manor
lodge
and
plunged
into
the
woods
again
the
afternoon
hush
rested
on
the
country
as
they
followed
kirke
along
a
narrow
path
that
led
almost
straight
to
the
point
where
it
was
decided
that
they
should
strike
south
in
half
a
dozen
places
it
cut
across
lanes
and
once
across
the
great
high
road
from
farningham
to
wrotham
as
they
drew
near
this
kirke
who
was
riding
in
front
checked
them
i
will
go
first
he
said
and
see
if
there
is
danger
in
a
minute
he
returned
there
is
a
man
about
a
hundred
yards
up
the
road
asleep
on
a
bank
and
there
is
a
cart
coming
up
from
wrotham
that
is
all
i
can
see
perhaps
we
had
better
wait
till
the
cart
is
gone
and
what
is
the
man
like
asked
anthony
he
is
a
beggar
i
should
say
but
has
his
hat
over
his
eyes
they
waited
till
the
cart
had
passed
anthony
dismounted
and
went
to
the
entrance
of
the
path
and
peered
out
at
the
man
he
was
lying
as
kirke
had
said
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
perfectly
still
anthony
examined
him
a
minute
or
two
he
was
in
tattered
clothes
and
a
great
stick
and
a
bundle
lay
beside
him
it
is
a
vagabond
he
said
we
can
go
on
the
whole
party
crossed
the
road
pushing
on
towards
the
edge
of
the
high
downs
over
kemsing
and
presently
came
to
the
ightam
road
where
it
began
to
run
steeply
down
hill
here
too
kirke
looked
this
way
and
that
but
no
one
was
in
sight
and
then
the
whole
party
crossed
they
kept
inside
the
edge
of
the
wood
all
the
way
along
the
downs
for
another
mile
or
so
with
the
rich
sunlit
valley
seen
in
glimpses
through
the
trees
here
and
there
and
the
pilgrim
way
lying
like
a
white
ribbon
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
below
them
until
at
last
kemsing
church
with
edith
chantry
at
the
side
lay
below
and
behind
them
and
they
came
out
on
to
the
edge
of
a
great
scoop
in
the
hill
like
a
theatre
and
the
blue
woods
and
hills
of
surrey
showed
opposite
beyond
otford
and
brasted
here
they
stopped
a
little
back
from
the
edge
and
kirke
gave
them
their
last
instructions
pointing
out
seal
across
the
valley
which
they
must
leave
on
their
left
skirting
the
meadows
to
the
west
of
the
church
and
passing
up
towards
knole
beyond
let
the
sun
be
a
little
on
your
right
he
said
all
the
way
and
you
will
strike
the
country
above
tonbridge
then
they
said
to
one
another
kirke
kissed
the
hand
in
gratitude
for
what
he
had
done
for
him
and
then
turned
back
along
the
edge
of
the
downs
riding
this
time
outside
the
woods
while
the
party
led
their
horses
carefully
down
the
steep
slope
across
the
pilgrim
way
and
then
struck
straight
out
over
the
meadows
to
seal
their
plan
seemed
supremely
successful
they
met
a
few
countrymen
and
lads
at
their
work
who
looked
a
little
astonished
at
first
at
this
great
party
riding
across
country
but
more
satisfied
when
anthony
had
inquired
of
them
whether
they
had
seen
a
falcon
or
heard
his
bells
no
they
had
not
they
said
and
went
on
with
their
curiosity
satisfied
once
as
they
were
passing
down
through
a
wood
on
to
the
weald
isabel
who
had
turned
in
her
saddle
and
was
looking
back
gave
a
low
cry
of
alarm
ah
the
man
the
man
she
said
the
others
turned
quickly
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
long
straight
ride
stretching
up
to
against
the
three
or
four
hundred
yards
behind
them
isabel
said
she
thought
she
saw
a
rider
pass
across
this
little
opening
at
the
end
framed
in
leaves
but
there
were
stags
everywhere
in
the
woods
here
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
mistake
one
for
the
other
at
that
distance
and
with
such
a
momentary
glance
once
again
nearer
tonbridge
they
had
a
fright
they
had
followed
up
a
grass
ride
into
a
copse
thinking
it
would
bring
them
out
somewhere
but
it
led
only
to
the
brink
of
a
deep
little
stream
where
the
plank
bridge
had
been
removed
so
they
were
obliged
to
retrace
their
steps
as
they
into
the
field
from
the
copse
a
large
man
on
a
brown
mare
almost
rode
into
them
he
was
out
of
breath
and
his
horse
seemed
distressed
anthony
as
usual
immediately
asked
if
he
had
seen
or
heard
anything
of
a
falcon
no
indeed
gentlemen
he
said
and
have
you
seen
aught
of
a
bitch
who
bolted
after
a
hare
some
half
mile
back
a
greyhound
i
should
be
loath
to
lose
they
had
not
and
said
so
and
the
man
still
panting
and
mopping
his
head
thanked
them
and
asked
whether
he
could
be
of
any
service
in
directing
them
if
they
were
strange
to
the
country
but
they
thought
it
better
not
to
give
him
any
hint
of
where
they
were
going
so
he
rode
off
presently
up
the
slope
across
their
route
and
disappeared
whistling
for
his
dog
and
so
at
last
about
four
in
the
afternoon
they
saw
the
church
spire
of
stanfield
above
them
on
the
hill
and
knew
that
they
were
near
the
end
of
their
troubles
another
hundred
yards
and
there
were
the
roofs
of
the
old
house
and
the
great
iron
gates
and
the
vanes
of
the
seen
over
the
clipped
limes
and
then
mary
corbet
and
buxton
hurrying
in
from
the
garden
as
they
came
through
the
low
oak
door
into
the
dear
tapestried
hall
chapter
ix
the
alarm
a
very
happy
party
sat
down
to
supper
that
evening
in
stanfield
place
anthony
had
taken
buxton
aside
privately
when
the
first
greetings
were
over
and
told
him
all
that
happened
the
alarm
at
stanstead
his
device
and
the
entire
peace
they
had
enjoyed
ever
since
isabel
he
ended
certainly
thought
she
saw
a
man
behind
us
once
but
we
were
among
the
deer
and
it
was
dusky
in
the
woods
and
for
myself
i
think
it
was
but
a
stag
but
if
you
think
there
is
danger
anywhere
i
will
gladly
ride
on
buxton
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
my
dear
friend
he
said
take
care
you
do
not
offend
me
i
am
a
slow
fellow
as
you
know
but
even
my
coarse
hide
is
pricked
sometimes
do
not
suggest
again
that
i
could
permit
any
priest
and
much
less
my
own
dear
friend
to
leave
me
when
there
was
danger
but
there
is
none
in
this
case
you
have
shaken
the
rogues
off
i
make
no
doubt
and
you
will
just
stay
here
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
at
the
very
least
anthony
said
that
he
agreed
with
him
as
to
the
complete
baffling
of
the
pursuers
but
added
that
isabel
was
still
a
little
shaken
and
would
buxton
say
a
word
to
her
why
i
will
take
her
round
the
myself
after
supper
and
show
her
how
strong
and
safe
we
are
we
will
all
go
round
in
the
he
said
a
word
or
two
of
reassurance
to
her
before
the
others
were
down
anthony
has
told
me
everything
mistress
isabel
and
i
warrant
that
the
knaves
are
cursing
their
stars
still
on
stanstead
hills
twenty
miles
from
here
you
are
as
safe
here
as
in
greenwich
palace
but
after
supper
to
satisfy
you
we
will
look
to
our
defences
but
believe
me
there
is
nothing
to
fear
he
spoke
with
such
confidence
and
cheerfulness
that
isabel
felt
her
fears
melting
and
before
supper
was
over
she
was
ashamed
of
them
and
said
so
nay
nay
said
buxton
you
shall
not
escape
you
shall
see
every
one
of
them
for
yourself
mistress
corbet
do
you
not
think
that
just
you
need
a
little
more
honest
worldliness
isabel
said
mary
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
i
believe
god
saves
the
priests
that
have
the
best
now
that
is
not
profane
so
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
it
is
the
plainest
sense
said
anthony
smiling
at
them
both
they
went
the
round
of
them
all
with
candles
and
anthony
refreshed
his
memory
they
visited
the
little
one
in
the
chapel
first
then
the
cupboard
and
at
the
top
of
the
corridor
the
chamber
over
the
fireplace
in
the
hall
and
lastly
in
the
wooden
they
lifted
the
edge
of
the
fifth
stair
from
the
bottom
so
that
its
front
and
the
top
of
the
stair
below
it
turned
on
a
hinge
and
dropped
open
leaving
a
black
space
behind
this
was
the
entrance
to
the
passage
that
led
beneath
the
garden
to
the
on
the
far
side
of
the
avenue
mistress
corbet
wrinkled
her
nose
at
the
damp
earthy
smell
that
breathed
out
of
the
dark
i
am
glad
i
am
not
a
priest
she
said
and
i
would
sooner
be
buried
dead
than
alive
and
there
is
a
rat
there
that
sorely
needs
burying
my
dear
lady
cried
the
contriver
of
the
passage
indignantly
her
grace
might
sleep
there
herself
and
take
no
harm
there
is
not
even
the
whisker
of
a
rat
it
is
not
the
whisker
that
i
mind
said
mary
it
is
the
rest
of
him
buxton
immediately
set
his
taper
down
and
climbed
in
you
shall
see
he
said
and
i
in
my
best
satin
too
he
was
inside
the
stairs
now
and
lying
on
his
back
on
the
smooth
board
that
backed
them
he
sidled
himself
slowly
along
towards
the
wall
press
the
fourth
brick
of
the
fourth
row
he
said
you
remember
father
anthony
he
had
reached
now
what
seemed
to
be
the
brick
wall
against
which
the
ends
of
the
stairs
rested
and
that
closed
that
end
of
the
cellars
altogether
anthony
leaned
in
with
a
candle
and
saw
how
that
part
of
the
wall
against
his
friend
right
side
slowly
turned
into
the
dark
as
the
fourth
brick
was
pressed
and
a
little
passage
appeared
beyond
buxton
edged
himself
sideways
into
the
passage
and
then
stood
nearly
upright
it
was
an
excellent
contrivance
even
if
the
searchers
should
find
the
chamber
beneath
the
stairs
which
was
unlikely
they
would
never
suspect
that
it
was
only
a
blind
to
a
passage
beyond
the
door
into
the
passage
consisted
of
a
strong
oaken
door
disguised
on
the
outside
by
a
facing
of
all
the
hinges
were
within
as
sweet
as
a
flower
said
the
architect
looking
about
him
his
voice
rang
muffled
and
hollow
then
the
friends
have
removed
the
corpse
said
mary
putting
her
head
in
while
you
were
opening
the
door
there
come
out
you
will
take
cold
i
believe
you
are
you
satisfied
said
buxton
to
isabel
as
they
went
upstairs
again
what
are
your
outer
defences
asked
mary
before
isabel
could
answer
you
shall
see
the
plan
in
the
hall
said
buxton
he
took
down
the
frame
that
held
the
plan
of
the
house
and
showed
them
the
outer
doors
there
was
first
the
low
oak
front
door
on
the
north
opening
on
to
the
little
court
this
was
immensely
strong
and
would
stand
battering
then
on
the
same
side
farther
east
within
the
there
was
the
servants
door
protected
by
chains
and
an
oak
bolt
that
ran
across
on
the
extreme
east
end
of
the
house
there
was
a
door
opening
into
the
garden
from
the
the
least
strong
of
all
there
was
another
on
the
south
side
opposite
the
front
door
that
gave
on
to
the
garden
and
lastly
there
was
an
entrance
into
the
priests
end
of
the
house
at
the
extreme
west
from
the
little
walled
garden
where
anthony
had
meditated
years
ago
this
walled
garden
had
a
very
strong
door
of
its
own
opening
on
to
the
lane
between
the
church
and
the
house
but
there
are
only
three
ways
out
really
said
buxton
for
the
garden
walls
are
high
and
strong
there
is
the
way
of
the
walled
garden
the
across
the
drive
and
through
the
on
to
the
to
east
maskells
all
the
other
gates
are
kept
barred
and
indeed
i
scarcely
know
where
the
keys
are
i
am
bewildered
said
mary
shall
we
go
round
he
asked
said
mary
i
am
tired
and
so
is
this
poor
child
come
we
will
go
to
bed
anthony
soon
went
too
both
he
and
isabel
were
tired
with
the
journey
and
the
strain
of
anxiety
and
it
was
a
keen
joy
to
him
to
be
back
again
in
his
own
dear
room
with
the
tapestry
of
thomas
of
aquin
and
clare
opposite
the
bed
and
the
wide
curtained
which
looked
out
on
the
little
walled
garden
buxton
was
left
alone
in
the
great
hall
below
with
the
two
tapers
burning
and
the
starlight
with
all
the
suffused
glow
of
a
summer
night
making
the
arms
glimmer
in
the
tall
windows
that
looked
south
lower
the
windows
were
open
and
the
mellow
scents
of
the
june
roses
and
of
the
and
lavender
poured
in
the
night
was
very
still
but
the
faintest
breath
came
from
time
to
time
across
the
meadows
and
rustled
in
the
stiff
leaves
with
the
noise
of
a
stealthy
movement
i
will
look
round
said
buxton
to
himself
he
stepped
out
immediately
into
the
garden
by
the
hall
door
and
turned
to
the
east
passing
along
the
lighted
windows
his
step
sounded
on
the
tiles
and
a
face
looked
out
swiftly
from
isabel
room
overhead
but
his
figure
was
plain
in
the
light
from
the
windows
as
he
came
out
round
the
corner
and
the
face
drew
back
he
crossed
the
east
end
of
the
house
and
went
through
a
little
door
into
the
locking
it
after
him
in
the
kennels
in
the
corner
came
a
movement
and
a
danish
hound
came
out
silently
into
the
cage
before
her
house
and
stood
up
like
a
slender
grey
ghost
paws
high
up
in
the
bars
and
whimpered
softly
to
her
lord
he
quieted
her
and
went
to
the
door
in
the
yard
that
opened
on
to
the
to
east
maskells
unbarred
it
and
stepped
through
there
was
a
dry
ditch
on
his
left
where
nettles
quivered
in
the
stirring
air
and
a
heavy
clump
of
bushes
rose
beyond
dark
and
impenetrable
buxton
stared
straight
at
these
a
moment
or
two
and
then
out
towards
east
maskells
there
lay
his
own
meadows
and
the
cattle
and
horses
secure
and
sleeping
then
he
stepped
back
again
barred
the
door
and
walked
up
through
the
into
the
front
court
there
the
great
iron
gates
rose
before
him
and
flimsy
in
the
starlight
he
went
up
to
them
and
shook
them
and
a
loose
shield
jangled
fiercely
overhead
then
he
peered
through
holding
the
bars
and
saw
the
familiar
patch
of
grass
beyond
the
gravel
sweep
and
the
dark
cottages
over
the
way
then
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
front
door
unlocked
it
with
his
private
key
passed
through
the
hall
through
a
parlour
or
two
into
the
lower
floor
of
the
priests
quarters
unlocked
softly
the
little
door
into
the
walled
garden
and
went
out
on
once
more
even
as
he
went
light
overhead
went
out
buxton
went
to
the
garden
door
unfastened
it
and
stepped
out
into
the
road
above
him
on
his
left
rose
up
the
chancel
of
the
parish
church
the
roofs
crowded
behind
and
immediately
in
front
was
the
churchyard
with
the
tall
irregular
wall
and
the
trees
above
all
blotting
out
the
stars
then
he
came
back
the
same
way
fastening
the
doors
as
he
passed
and
reached
the
hall
where
the
tapers
still
burned
he
blew
out
one
and
took
the
other
i
suppose
i
am
a
fool
he
said
the
lad
is
as
safe
as
in
his
arms
and
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
mary
corbet
rose
late
next
morning
and
when
she
came
down
at
last
found
the
others
in
the
garden
she
joined
them
as
they
walked
in
the
little
avenue
have
not
the
arrived
she
asked
what
are
they
about
and
you
dear
isabel
how
did
you
sleep
isabel
looked
a
little
i
did
not
sleep
well
she
said
i
fear
i
disturbed
her
said
buxton
she
heard
me
as
i
went
round
the
house
why
did
you
go
round
the
house
asked
anthony
i
often
do
he
said
shortly
and
there
was
no
one
asked
mary
there
was
no
one
and
what
would
you
have
done
if
there
had
been
yes
said
anthony
what
would
you
have
done
to
warn
us
all
buxton
considered
i
should
have
rung
the
alarm
i
think
he
said
but
i
did
not
know
you
had
one
said
mary
buxton
pointed
to
a
turret
peeping
between
two
high
gables
above
his
own
room
and
what
does
it
sound
like
it
is
deep
and
has
a
dash
of
sourness
or
shrillness
in
it
i
can
not
describe
it
above
all
it
is
marvellous
loud
then
if
we
hear
it
we
shall
know
the
are
on
us
asked
mary
buxton
bowed
or
that
the
house
is
afire
he
said
or
that
the
french
or
spanish
are
landed
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
just
slightly
uneasy
isabel
had
been
far
more
silent
than
he
had
ever
known
her
and
her
nerves
were
plainly
at
an
acute
tension
she
started
violently
even
now
when
a
servant
came
out
between
two
to
call
buxton
in
her
alarm
had
affected
him
and
besides
he
knew
something
of
the
extraordinary
skill
and
patience
of
walsingham
agents
and
even
the
story
of
the
ferry
had
startled
him
could
it
really
be
he
had
wondered
as
he
tossed
to
and
fro
in
the
hot
night
that
this
innocent
priest
had
thrown
off
his
pursuers
so
completely
as
had
appeared
in
the
morning
he
had
sent
down
a
servant
to
the
inn
to
inquire
whether
anything
had
been
seen
or
heard
of
a
disquieting
nature
now
the
servant
had
come
to
tell
him
as
he
had
ordered
privately
he
went
with
the
man
in
through
the
leaving
the
others
to
walk
in
the
avenue
and
then
faced
him
well
he
said
sharply
no
sir
there
is
nothing
there
is
a
party
there
travelling
on
to
brighthelmstone
this
afternoon
and
four
drovers
who
came
in
last
night
sir
and
two
gentlemen
travelling
across
country
but
they
left
early
this
morning
they
left
you
say
they
left
at
eight
sir
buxton
attention
was
attracted
to
these
two
gentlemen
go
and
find
out
where
they
came
from
he
said
and
let
me
know
after
dinner
the
man
bowed
and
left
the
room
and
almost
immediately
the
rang
mary
was
frankly
happy
she
loved
to
be
down
here
in
this
superb
weather
with
her
friends
she
enjoyed
this
beautiful
house
with
its
furniture
and
pictures
and
even
took
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
themselves
although
in
this
case
she
was
satisfied
they
would
not
be
needed
she
had
heard
the
tale
of
the
stanstead
woods
and
had
no
shadow
of
doubt
but
that
the
searchers
if
indeed
they
were
searchers
at
all
were
baffled
so
at
dinner
she
talked
exactly
as
usual
and
the
cloud
of
slight
discomfort
that
still
hung
over
isabel
grew
lighter
and
lighter
as
she
listened
the
windows
of
the
hall
were
flung
wide
and
the
warm
summer
air
poured
from
the
garden
into
the
cool
room
with
its
polished
floor
and
table
decked
with
roses
in
silver
bowls
with
its
grave
tapestries
stirring
on
the
walls
behind
the
grim
visors
and
pikes
that
hung
against
them
the
talk
turned
on
music
ah
i
would
i
had
my
lute
sighed
mary
but
my
woman
forgot
to
bring
it
what
a
garden
to
sing
in
in
the
shade
of
the
yews
with
the
behind
to
make
the
voice
sound
better
than
it
is
buxton
made
a
complimentary
murmur
thank
you
she
said
master
anthony
you
are
indeed
not
he
said
but
i
was
thinking
where
i
had
seen
a
lute
ah
it
is
in
the
little
west
parlour
a
lute
cried
mary
ah
but
i
have
no
music
and
i
have
not
the
courage
to
sing
the
only
song
i
know
over
and
over
again
but
there
is
music
too
said
anthony
mary
clapped
her
hands
when
dinner
is
over
she
said
you
and
i
will
go
to
find
it
dinner
was
over
at
last
and
the
four
rose
come
said
mary
while
isabel
turned
into
the
garden
and
buxton
went
to
his
room
we
will
be
with
you
presently
she
cried
after
isabel
then
the
two
went
together
to
the
little
west
parlour
with
a
wide
fireplace
with
the
logs
in
their
places
and
the
latticed
windows
with
their
glass
looking
upon
the
walled
garden
anthony
stood
on
a
chair
and
opened
the
top
window
letting
a
flood
of
summer
noises
into
the
room
they
found
the
lute
music
written
over
its
six
lines
with
the
queer
and
double
f
and
numerals
all
hebrew
to
anthony
but
bursting
and
blossoming
with
delicate
melodies
to
mary
eyes
then
she
took
up
the
lute
and
tuned
it
on
her
knee
still
sitting
in
a
deep
with
her
buckled
feet
before
her
while
anthony
sat
opposite
and
watched
her
supple
flashing
fingers
busy
among
the
strings
and
her
grave
abstracted
look
as
she
listened
critically
then
she
sounded
the
strings
in
little
rippling
chords
ah
it
is
a
sweet
old
lute
she
said
put
the
music
before
me
anthony
propped
it
on
a
chair
is
that
the
right
side
up
he
asked
mary
smiled
and
nodded
still
looking
at
the
music
now
then
she
said
and
began
the
prelude
anthony
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
as
the
delicate
tinkling
began
to
pour
out
and
overscore
the
soft
cooing
of
a
pigeon
on
the
roofs
somewhere
and
the
murmur
of
bees
through
the
open
window
it
was
an
old
precise
little
from
italy
with
a
long
prelude
suggesting
by
its
tender
minor
chords
true
and
restrained
love
not
passionate
but
tender
not
despairing
but
melancholy
it
was
a
love
that
had
for
its
symbols
not
the
rose
and
the
lily
but
the
lavender
and
thyme
acrid
in
its
sweetness
the
prelude
had
climbed
up
by
melodious
steps
to
the
keynote
and
was
now
rippling
down
again
after
its
aspirations
mary
stirred
herself
ah
now
the
voice
would
come
in
the
last
chord
when
all
the
music
was
first
drowned
and
then
ceased
as
with
crash
after
crash
a
great
bell
sonorous
and
piercing
began
to
sound
from
overhead
chapter
x
the
passage
to
the
the
two
looked
at
one
another
with
parted
lips
but
without
a
word
then
both
rose
simultaneously
then
the
bell
jangled
and
ceased
and
a
crowd
of
other
noises
began
there
were
shouts
tramplings
of
hoofs
in
the
court
shrill
voices
came
over
the
wall
then
a
scream
or
two
mary
sprang
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
stood
there
listening
then
from
the
interior
of
the
house
came
an
indescribable
din
tramplings
of
feet
and
shouts
of
anger
then
violent
blows
on
woodwork
it
came
nearer
in
a
moment
of
time
as
a
tide
comes
in
over
flat
sands
remorselessly
swift
then
mary
with
one
movement
was
inside
again
and
had
locked
the
door
and
drawn
the
bolt
up
there
she
said
it
is
the
only
way
they
are
outside
and
she
pointed
to
the
chimney
anthony
began
to
remonstrate
it
was
intolerable
he
felt
to
climb
up
the
chimney
like
a
hunted
cat
and
he
began
a
word
or
two
but
mary
seized
his
arm
you
must
not
be
caught
she
said
there
are
others
and
there
came
a
confused
battering
and
trampling
outside
she
pushed
him
towards
the
chimney
then
decision
came
to
him
and
he
bent
his
head
and
stepped
upon
the
logs
laid
upon
the
ashes
crushing
them
down
ah
go
said
mary
voice
behind
him
as
the
door
began
to
bulge
and
creak
there
was
plainly
a
tremendous
struggle
in
the
little
passage
outside
anthony
threw
his
hands
up
and
felt
a
high
ledge
in
the
darkness
gripped
it
with
his
hands
and
made
a
huge
effort
combined
of
a
tug
and
a
spring
his
feet
rapped
sharply
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
iron
and
then
his
knee
reached
the
ledge
and
he
was
up
he
straightened
himself
on
the
ledge
stood
upright
and
looked
down
two
white
hands
with
rings
on
them
were
lifting
the
logs
and
drawing
them
out
from
the
ashes
shaking
them
and
replacing
them
by
others
from
the
and
all
deliberately
as
if
laying
a
fire
then
her
voice
came
up
to
him
hushed
but
distinct
go
up
quickly
i
will
feign
to
be
burning
papers
there
will
be
smoke
but
no
sparks
it
is
green
wood
anthony
again
felt
above
him
and
found
two
iron
in
the
chimney
one
above
the
other
he
was
in
here
but
far
above
there
was
a
patch
of
pale
smoky
light
and
all
the
chimney
seemed
full
of
a
murmurous
sound
he
tugged
at
the
rings
and
found
them
secure
and
drew
himself
up
steadily
by
the
higher
one
until
his
knee
struck
the
lower
then
with
a
great
effort
he
got
his
knee
upon
it
then
his
left
foot
and
again
straightened
himself
then
as
he
felt
in
the
darkness
once
more
he
found
a
system
of
rings
one
above
the
other
up
the
side
of
the
chimney
by
which
it
was
not
hard
to
climb
as
he
went
up
he
began
to
perceive
a
sharp
acrid
smell
his
eyes
smarted
and
he
closed
them
but
his
throat
burned
he
climbed
fiercely
and
then
suddenly
saw
immediately
below
him
another
hearth
he
was
looking
over
the
fireplate
of
some
other
room
in
a
moment
more
he
thrust
his
head
over
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
clear
air
then
he
listened
intently
from
below
still
came
a
murmur
of
confusion
but
in
this
room
all
was
quiet
he
began
to
think
frantically
he
could
not
remain
in
the
chimney
it
was
hopeless
they
would
soon
light
fires
he
knew
in
all
the
chimneys
and
bring
him
down
what
room
was
this
he
was
bewildered
and
could
not
remember
but
at
least
he
would
climb
into
it
and
try
to
escape
in
a
moment
more
he
had
lifted
himself
over
the
fireplate
and
dropped
safely
on
to
the
hearth
of
his
own
bedroom
the
fresh
air
and
the
familiarity
of
the
room
as
he
looked
round
swept
the
confusion
out
of
his
brain
like
a
breeze
the
thundering
and
shouting
continued
below
then
he
went
on
to
the
door
and
opened
it
round
to
the
right
was
the
head
of
the
stairs
which
led
straight
into
the
little
passage
where
the
struggle
was
going
on
he
could
hear
voice
in
the
din
plainly
there
was
no
way
down
the
stairs
to
the
left
was
the
passage
that
ended
in
a
window
with
the
chapel
door
at
the
left
and
the
false
shelves
on
the
right
he
hesitated
a
moment
between
the
two
and
then
decided
for
the
cupboard
there
was
a
clean
doublet
there
his
own
was
one
black
smear
of
soot
and
as
he
thought
of
it
he
drew
off
his
sooty
shoes
his
hose
were
fortunately
dark
he
stepped
straight
out
of
the
door
leaving
it
just
ajar
even
as
he
left
it
there
was
a
thunder
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
he
was
at
the
shelves
in
a
moment
catching
a
glimpse
through
the
window
on
his
left
of
the
front
court
crowded
with
men
and
horses
he
had
opened
and
shut
the
secret
door
three
or
four
times
the
evening
before
and
his
hands
closed
almost
instinctively
on
the
two
springs
that
must
be
worked
simultaneously
he
made
the
necessary
movement
and
the
shelves
with
the
wall
behind
it
softly
slid
open
and
he
sprang
in
but
as
he
closed
it
he
heard
one
of
the
two
books
drop
and
an
exclamation
from
the
passage
he
had
just
left
then
quick
steps
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
steps
clattered
past
the
door
and
into
the
chapel
opposite
and
stopped
anthony
felt
about
him
in
the
darkness
found
the
doublet
and
lifted
it
off
the
nail
slipped
off
his
own
tearing
his
ruff
as
he
did
so
and
then
quickly
put
on
the
other
he
had
no
shoes
but
that
would
not
be
so
noticeable
he
had
not
seriously
thought
of
the
possibility
of
escaping
through
the
as
he
felt
sure
the
house
would
be
overrun
by
now
but
he
put
his
eyes
to
the
pinholes
and
looked
out
and
to
his
astonishment
saw
that
the
gallery
was
empty
there
it
lay
with
its
flemish
furniture
on
the
right
and
its
row
of
windows
on
the
left
and
all
as
tranquil
as
if
there
were
no
fierce
tragedy
of
terror
and
wrath
raging
below
again
decision
came
to
him
by
a
process
of
thought
so
swift
that
it
was
an
intuition
he
remembered
that
the
fall
of
the
book
outside
would
concentrate
attention
on
that
corner
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
shelves
were
broken
in
and
if
he
did
not
escape
now
there
would
be
no
possibility
later
then
he
unslid
the
inside
bolt
and
the
portrait
swung
open
he
closed
it
behind
and
sped
on
silent
shoeless
feet
down
the
polished
floor
of
the
gallery
of
course
the
great
staircase
was
hopeless
the
hall
would
be
seething
with
men
but
there
was
just
a
chance
through
the
servants
quarters
he
dashed
past
the
head
of
the
stairs
catching
a
glimpse
of
heads
and
sparkles
of
steel
over
the
banisters
and
through
the
door
at
the
end
finding
himself
in
the
men
corridor
that
was
a
continuation
of
the
gallery
he
had
left
on
his
left
rose
the
head
of
the
that
led
first
with
a
double
flight
to
the
offices
the
pantry
the
buttery
and
the
kitchen
and
than
lower
still
a
single
third
flight
down
to
the
cellar
he
looked
down
the
stairs
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
double
flight
were
a
couple
of
maids
screaming
and
leaning
and
pressing
against
the
door
immediately
below
the
one
he
had
just
come
through
himself
the
door
was
plainly
barred
as
well
for
it
was
now
thudding
and
cracking
with
blows
that
were
being
showered
upon
it
from
the
other
side
the
maids
it
seemed
to
him
in
a
panic
had
locked
the
door
but
that
panic
might
be
his
salvation
he
dashed
down
the
stairs
the
maids
screamed
louder
than
ever
when
they
saw
this
man
whom
they
did
not
recognise
with
blackened
face
and
hands
come
in
noiseless
leaps
down
towards
them
but
anthony
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
he
flew
past
them
then
he
dashed
open
the
little
door
that
shut
off
the
closed
it
behind
him
and
was
immediately
in
the
dark
then
he
groped
his
way
down
feeling
the
rough
brick
wall
as
he
went
till
he
reached
the
floor
of
the
cellar
the
air
was
cool
and
damp
here
and
it
refreshed
him
for
he
was
pouring
with
sweat
the
noise
too
and
confusion
which
during
his
flight
had
been
reverberating
through
the
house
with
a
formidable
din
now
only
reached
him
as
a
murmur
as
he
counted
the
four
steps
up
and
then
lifted
the
overhanging
edge
there
came
upon
him
irresistibly
the
contrast
between
the
serene
party
here
last
night
with
their
tapers
and
their
delicate
dresses
and
cool
voice
and
his
own
person
his
desperate
energy
and
his
quick
panting
and
then
the
steps
dropped
and
he
slid
in
lifted
them
again
as
he
lay
on
his
back
and
heard
the
spring
catch
as
they
closed
then
he
was
in
silence
too
and
comparative
safety
but
he
dared
not
rest
yet
and
edged
himself
along
as
he
had
seen
buxton
do
last
night
which
brick
was
it
the
fourth
of
the
fourth
he
murmured
and
counted
and
pressed
it
again
the
door
pushed
back
and
with
a
little
struggle
he
was
first
on
his
knees
and
then
on
his
feet
then
he
swung
the
door
to
again
behind
him
then
for
the
first
time
he
rested
he
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
tunnel
and
passed
his
blackened
hands
over
his
face
five
minutes
ago
yes
certainly
not
five
minutes
ago
he
was
lounging
in
the
west
parlour
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
while
mary
played
the
prelude
to
an
italian
what
was
she
doing
now
god
bless
her
for
her
quick
courage
and
isabel
and
buxton
where
were
they
all
how
deadly
sick
and
tired
he
felt
again
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
face
in
the
pitch
well
he
must
push
on
he
turned
and
began
to
grope
patiently
through
the
blackness
step
by
step
feeling
the
roughness
of
the
bricks
beneath
with
his
shoeless
feet
before
he
set
them
down
once
or
twice
he
stepped
into
a
little
icy
pool
which
had
collected
through
some
crack
in
the
vaulting
overhead
once
too
he
slipped
on
a
lump
of
something
wet
and
shapeless
and
thought
even
then
of
mary
suspicions
the
night
before
he
pushed
on
shivering
now
with
cold
and
excitement
through
what
seemed
the
interminable
tunnel
until
at
last
his
outstretched
hands
touched
wood
before
him
he
had
not
seen
this
end
of
the
passage
for
nearly
two
years
and
he
wondered
if
he
could
remember
the
method
of
opening
and
gave
a
gulp
of
horror
at
the
thought
that
he
might
not
but
there
had
been
no
reason
to
make
a
secret
of
the
inside
of
the
door
and
he
presently
found
a
button
and
drew
it
it
creaked
rustily
but
gave
and
the
door
with
another
pull
opened
inwards
and
there
was
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
then
he
remembered
that
the
entrances
to
the
tunnel
at
either
end
were
exactly
on
the
same
system
and
putting
out
his
hands
felt
the
slope
of
the
underside
of
the
staircase
cutting
diagonally
across
the
opening
of
the
passage
he
slid
himself
on
to
the
boarding
sideways
and
drew
the
brickwork
towards
him
till
the
spring
snapped
and
lay
there
to
consider
before
he
went
farther
first
he
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
construction
of
the
the
basement
in
which
he
was
lying
corresponded
to
the
cellar
under
the
house
from
which
he
had
come
and
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
building
about
forty
feet
by
twenty
it
was
a
large
empty
chamber
where
nothing
of
any
value
was
kept
he
remembered
last
time
he
was
here
seeing
a
heap
of
tiles
in
one
corner
with
a
pile
of
disused
poles
pieces
of
rope
and
old
iron
in
another
the
stairs
led
up
through
an
ordinary
into
what
was
the
of
the
house
this
too
was
one
immense
room
with
four
latticed
windows
looking
on
to
the
garden
and
one
with
opaque
glass
on
to
the
lane
at
the
back
and
a
great
door
generally
kept
locked
for
rather
more
valuable
things
were
kept
here
such
as
the
and
the
targets
for
archery
then
a
light
staircase
led
straight
up
from
this
room
to
the
next
floor
which
was
divided
into
two
both
of
which
so
far
as
anthony
remembered
were
empty
buxton
had
thought
of
letting
his
gardeners
sleep
there
when
he
had
at
first
built
this
immense
useless
but
he
had
ultimately
built
a
little
gardener
cottage
adjoining
it
the
two
fantastic
towers
that
flanked
the
building
held
nothing
but
staircases
which
could
be
entered
by
either
of
the
two
floors
and
which
ascended
to
tiny
rooms
with
windows
on
all
four
sides
when
anthony
had
run
over
these
details
as
he
lay
on
his
back
he
pushed
up
the
stair
over
his
face
and
let
the
front
of
it
with
the
step
of
the
next
swing
inwards
the
light
was
stronger
now
and
poured
in
though
still
dim
through
three
windows
glazed
and
wired
that
just
rose
above
the
level
of
the
ground
outside
then
he
extricated
himself
closed
the
steps
behind
him
and
went
up
the
stairs
the
at
the
top
was
a
little
stiff
but
he
soon
raised
it
and
in
a
moment
more
was
standing
in
the
room
of
the
all
round
him
was
much
as
he
remembered
it
he
first
went
to
the
door
and
found
it
securely
fastened
as
it
often
was
for
days
together
he
glanced
at
the
windows
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
too
and
then
went
to
them
to
look
out
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
corner
of
one
pane
broken
away
he
put
his
eye
to
this
and
there
lay
a
little
lawn
with
a
beyond
blotting
out
all
of
the
great
house
opposite
except
the
chimneys
the
house
which
even
across
the
whole
space
of
garden
hummed
like
a
hive
on
the
lawn
was
a
chair
and
an
book
lay
face
down
on
the
grass
beside
it
anthony
stared
at
it
it
was
the
book
that
he
had
seen
in
isabel
hand
not
half
an
hour
ago
as
she
had
gone
out
into
the
garden
from
the
hall
to
wait
until
he
and
mary
joined
her
with
the
lute
and
at
that
the
priest
knelt
down
before
the
window
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
began
to
stammer
and
cry
to
god
o
god
god
god
he
said
when
mary
corbet
had
seen
anthony
feet
disappear
she
already
had
the
outline
of
a
plan
in
her
mind
to
light
a
fire
and
pretend
to
be
burning
important
papers
would
serve
as
an
excuse
for
keeping
the
door
fast
it
would
also
suggest
at
least
that
no
one
was
in
the
chimney
the
ordinary
wood
however
sent
up
sparks
but
she
had
noticed
before
a
little
green
wood
in
the
basket
and
knew
that
this
did
not
do
so
to
the
same
extent
so
she
pulled
out
the
dry
wood
that
anthony
had
trodden
into
the
ashes
and
substituted
the
other
then
she
had
looked
round
for
paper
the
lute
music
that
was
all
meantime
the
door
was
giving
the
noise
outside
was
terrible
and
it
was
evident
that
one
or
two
of
the
servants
were
obstructing
the
passage
of
the
pursuivants
when
at
last
the
door
flew
in
there
was
a
fire
cracking
furiously
on
the
hearth
and
a
magnificently
dressed
lady
kneeling
before
it
crushing
paper
into
the
flames
half
a
dozen
men
now
streamed
in
and
more
began
to
follow
and
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
staring
at
her
from
the
resistance
they
had
met
with
they
had
been
certain
that
the
priest
was
here
and
this
sight
perplexed
them
a
big
ruddy
man
however
who
led
them
sprang
across
the
room
seized
mary
corbet
by
the
shoulders
and
whisked
her
away
against
the
wall
and
then
dashed
the
paper
out
of
the
grate
and
began
to
beat
out
the
flames
mary
struggled
violently
for
a
moment
but
the
others
were
upon
her
and
held
her
and
she
presently
stood
quiet
then
she
began
upon
them
you
insolent
hounds
she
cried
do
you
know
who
i
am
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
her
eyes
blazing
she
seemed
in
a
superb
fury
burning
treasonable
papers
growled
the
big
man
from
his
knees
on
the
hearth
that
is
enough
for
me
who
are
you
sir
that
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
the
man
got
up
the
flames
were
out
now
and
he
slipped
the
papers
into
a
pocket
mary
went
on
immediately
if
i
may
not
burn
my
own
lute
music
or
keep
my
door
locked
without
a
riotous
mob
of
knaves
breaking
upon
me
ah
how
dare
you
and
she
stamped
furiously
the
pursuivant
came
up
close
to
her
insolently
see
here
my
lady
he
began
the
men
had
fallen
back
from
her
a
little
now
that
the
papers
were
safe
and
she
lifted
her
ringed
hand
and
struck
his
ruddy
face
with
all
her
might
there
was
a
moment
of
confusion
and
laughter
as
he
recoiled
now
will
you
remember
that
her
grace
ladies
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
there
was
a
murmur
from
the
crowded
room
and
a
voice
near
the
door
cried
she
says
truth
nichol
it
is
mistress
corbet
nichol
had
recovered
himself
but
was
furiously
angry
very
good
madam
but
i
have
these
papers
now
he
said
they
can
still
be
read
you
blind
idiot
hissed
mary
do
you
not
know
lute
music
when
you
see
it
i
know
that
ladies
do
not
burn
lute
music
with
locked
doors
observed
nichol
bitterly
the
more
fool
you
screamed
mary
when
you
have
caught
one
at
it
that
will
be
seen
sneered
nichol
not
by
a
damned
blind
porpoise
screamed
mary
apparently
more
in
a
passion
than
ever
and
a
burst
of
laughter
came
from
the
men
this
was
too
much
for
nichol
this
coarse
abuse
stung
him
cruelly
god
blood
he
bellowed
at
the
room
take
this
vixen
out
and
search
the
place
and
a
torrent
of
oaths
drove
the
crowd
about
the
door
out
into
the
passage
again
a
couple
of
men
took
mary
by
the
fierce
ringed
hands
of
hers
that
still
twitched
and
clenched
and
led
her
out
she
spat
insults
over
her
shoulders
as
she
went
but
she
had
held
him
in
talk
as
she
intended
now
then
roared
nichol
again
search
you
dogs
he
himself
went
outside
too
and
seeing
the
stairs
stamped
up
them
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
tacitus
settle
down
with
crumpled
pages
stopped
for
a
moment
bewildered
for
it
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
and
then
rushed
at
the
open
door
on
the
left
dashed
it
open
and
found
a
little
empty
room
with
a
chair
or
two
and
a
table
but
no
sign
of
the
priest
it
was
like
magic
then
out
he
came
once
more
and
went
into
anthony
own
room
the
great
bed
was
on
his
right
the
window
opposite
the
fireplace
to
the
left
and
in
the
middle
lay
two
sooty
shoes
instinctively
he
bent
and
touched
them
and
found
them
warm
then
he
sprang
to
the
door
still
keeping
his
face
to
the
room
and
shouted
for
help
he
is
here
he
is
here
he
cried
and
a
thunder
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
answered
him
meanwhile
the
men
that
held
mary
followed
the
others
along
the
passage
but
while
the
leaders
went
on
and
round
into
the
lower
corridor
the
two
with
their
prisoner
turned
aside
into
the
parlour
that
served
as
an
to
the
hall
beyond
where
they
released
her
here
though
it
was
empty
of
people
all
was
in
confusion
the
table
had
been
overturned
in
the
struggle
that
had
raged
along
here
between
men
who
had
entered
from
the
front
door
and
the
servants
of
the
house
who
had
rushed
in
from
their
quarters
at
the
first
alarm
and
intercepted
them
one
chair
lay
on
its
side
with
its
splintered
carved
arm
beside
it
as
mary
stood
a
moment
looking
about
her
the
door
from
the
hall
that
had
been
closed
again
opened
and
isabel
came
through
and
a
man
voice
said
you
must
wait
here
madam
then
the
door
closed
behind
her
isabel
said
mary
the
two
looked
at
one
another
a
moment
but
before
either
spoke
again
the
door
again
and
a
voice
began
to
speak
as
if
its
owner
still
held
the
handle
very
well
lackington
keep
him
in
his
room
i
will
go
through
here
to
nichol
isabel
had
drawn
a
sharp
breath
as
the
voice
began
and
as
the
door
opened
wider
she
turned
and
faced
it
then
hubert
came
in
and
recoiled
on
the
threshold
there
fell
a
complete
silence
in
the
room
hubert
said
isabel
after
a
moment
what
are
you
doing
here
hubert
shut
the
door
abruptly
and
leaned
against
it
staring
at
her
his
face
had
gone
white
under
the
tan
isabel
still
looked
at
him
steadily
and
her
eyes
were
eloquent
then
she
spoke
again
and
something
in
her
voice
quickened
the
beating
of
mary
heart
as
she
listened
hubert
have
you
forgotten
us
still
hubert
stared
then
he
stood
upright
the
two
were
watching
in
astonishment
i
will
see
to
the
ladies
he
said
abruptly
and
waved
his
hand
they
still
hesitated
a
moment
go
he
said
again
sharply
and
pointed
to
the
door
he
was
a
magistrate
and
responsible
and
they
turned
and
went
then
hubert
looked
at
isabel
again
isabel
he
said
if
i
had
known
stay
she
interrupted
there
is
no
time
for
explanations
except
mine
anthony
is
in
the
house
i
do
not
know
where
you
must
save
him
there
was
no
entreaty
or
anxiety
in
her
voice
nothing
but
a
supreme
dignity
and
an
assurance
that
she
would
be
obeyed
but
he
began
the
door
was
opened
from
the
hall
and
a
little
party
of
searchers
appeared
but
halted
when
the
magistrate
turned
round
come
with
me
he
said
to
the
two
women
you
must
have
a
room
kept
for
you
upstairs
and
he
held
back
the
door
for
them
to
pass
isabel
put
out
her
hand
to
mary
and
the
two
went
out
together
into
the
hall
past
the
men
who
stood
back
to
let
them
through
and
hubert
followed
they
turned
to
the
left
to
the
stairs
looking
as
they
went
upon
the
wild
confusion
above
them
rose
the
carved
ceiling
and
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
untouched
by
a
strange
chance
stood
the
still
laid
with
silver
and
fruit
and
flowers
but
all
else
was
in
disarray
the
leather
screen
that
had
stood
by
the
door
into
the
entrance
hall
had
been
overthrown
and
had
carried
with
it
a
tall
flowering
plant
that
now
lay
trampled
and
broken
before
the
hearth
a
couple
of
chairs
lay
on
their
backs
between
the
windows
the
rug
under
the
window
was
huddled
in
a
heap
and
all
over
the
polished
boards
were
scratches
and
dents
a
broken
lay
on
the
floor
with
a
feathered
cap
beside
it
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
guarding
the
four
doors
but
the
rest
were
gone
and
from
overhead
came
tramplings
and
shouts
as
the
hunt
swept
to
and
fro
in
the
upper
floors
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
was
mary
room
the
two
ladies
who
had
gone
silently
upstairs
with
hubert
behind
them
stopped
at
the
door
of
it
here
if
you
please
said
mary
before
hubert
could
answer
lackington
came
down
the
passage
hurrying
with
a
drawn
sword
and
his
hat
on
his
head
isabel
did
not
recognise
him
as
he
stopped
and
tapped
hubert
on
the
arm
familiarly
the
prisoners
must
not
be
together
he
said
hubert
drew
back
his
arm
and
looked
the
man
in
the
face
they
are
not
prisoners
and
they
shall
be
together
take
off
your
hat
sir
then
as
lackington
drew
back
astonished
he
opened
the
door
you
shall
not
be
disturbed
here
he
said
and
the
two
went
in
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
outside
the
door
and
they
heard
a
name
called
once
or
twice
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
then
came
a
tap
and
hubert
stepped
in
quietly
and
closed
the
door
i
have
placed
my
own
man
outside
he
said
and
none
shall
trouble
you
and
mistress
isabel
i
will
do
my
best
then
he
bowed
and
went
out
the
long
miserable
afternoon
began
they
watched
through
the
windows
the
sentries
going
up
and
down
the
broad
paths
between
the
glowing
and
out
over
the
high
iron
fence
that
separated
the
garden
from
the
meadows
the
crowd
of
villagers
and
children
watching
but
the
real
terror
for
them
both
lay
in
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
interior
of
the
house
there
was
a
continual
tramp
of
the
sentries
placed
in
every
corridor
and
lobby
and
of
the
messengers
that
went
to
and
fro
then
from
room
after
room
came
the
sounds
of
blows
the
rending
of
woodwork
and
once
or
twice
the
crash
of
glass
as
the
searchers
went
about
their
work
and
at
every
shout
the
women
shuddered
or
drew
their
breath
sharply
for
any
one
of
the
noises
might
be
the
sign
of
arrest
the
two
had
soon
talked
out
every
theory
in
low
voices
but
they
both
agreed
that
he
was
still
in
the
house
somewhere
and
on
the
upper
floor
it
was
impossible
they
thought
for
him
to
have
made
his
way
down
there
were
four
possibilities
therefore
either
he
might
still
be
in
the
chimney
in
that
case
it
was
no
use
hoping
or
he
was
in
the
or
in
that
behind
the
portrait
or
in
one
last
one
in
the
room
next
to
their
own
the
searchers
had
been
there
early
in
the
afternoon
but
perhaps
had
not
found
it
its
entrance
was
behind
the
window
shutter
and
was
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
so
they
talked
these
two
and
conjectured
and
prayed
as
the
evening
drew
on
and
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
church
and
the
garden
to
lie
in
cool
shadow
about
eight
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
hubert
came
in
with
a
tray
of
food
in
his
hands
which
he
set
down
all
is
in
confusion
he
said
but
this
is
the
best
i
can
do
he
broke
off
mistress
isabel
he
said
coming
nearer
to
the
two
as
they
sat
together
in
the
i
can
do
little
they
have
found
three
but
so
far
he
has
escaped
i
do
what
i
can
to
draw
them
off
but
they
are
too
clever
and
zealous
if
you
can
tell
me
more
perhaps
i
can
do
more
the
two
were
looking
at
him
with
startled
eyes
three
mary
said
yes
three
and
indeed
he
stopped
as
isabel
got
up
and
came
towards
him
hubert
she
said
resolutely
i
must
tell
you
he
must
be
still
in
the
chimney
of
the
little
west
parlour
do
what
you
can
the
west
parlour
he
said
that
was
where
mistress
corbet
was
burning
the
papers
yes
said
mary
he
is
not
there
said
hubert
we
have
sent
a
boy
up
and
down
it
already
ah
dear
god
said
mary
from
the
then
he
has
escaped
isabel
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
shook
her
head
it
can
not
be
she
said
the
guards
were
all
round
the
house
before
the
alarm
rang
hubert
nodded
and
mary
face
fell
then
is
there
no
way
out
he
asked
mary
sprang
up
with
shining
eyes
he
has
done
it
she
said
and
threw
her
arms
round
isabel
and
kissed
her
well
said
hubert
what
can
i
do
you
must
leave
us
said
isabel
come
back
later
then
when
we
have
searched
the
why
what
is
it
a
look
of
such
anguish
had
come
into
their
faces
that
he
stopped
amazed
the
cried
mary
no
no
no
no
no
hubert
hubert
cried
isabel
you
must
not
go
there
why
he
said
it
was
i
that
proposed
it
to
draw
them
from
the
house
there
came
from
beneath
the
windows
a
sudden
tramp
of
footsteps
and
then
nichol
voice
distinctly
heard
through
the
open
panes
we
can
not
wait
for
him
come
men
they
are
going
without
me
said
hubert
and
turned
and
ran
through
the
door
chapter
xi
the
during
that
long
afternoon
the
master
of
the
house
had
sat
in
his
own
room
before
his
table
hearing
the
ceaseless
footsteps
and
the
voices
overhead
and
the
ring
of
feet
on
the
tiles
outside
his
window
knowing
that
his
friend
and
priest
was
somewhere
in
the
house
crouching
in
some
dark
little
space
listening
to
the
same
footsteps
and
voices
as
they
came
and
went
by
his
and
that
he
himself
was
absolutely
powerless
to
help
he
had
been
overpowered
in
the
first
rush
as
he
pealed
on
the
to
which
he
had
rushed
when
the
groom
burst
in
from
the
crying
that
the
outer
court
was
full
of
men
lackington
had
then
sent
him
under
guard
to
his
own
room
where
he
had
been
locked
in
with
an
armed
constable
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
escape
in
the
struggle
he
had
received
a
blow
on
the
head
which
had
completely
dazed
him
all
his
resource
left
him
and
he
had
no
desire
even
to
move
from
his
chair
now
he
sat
with
his
head
on
his
breast
and
his
mind
going
the
ceaseless
round
of
all
the
possible
places
where
anthony
might
be
little
scenes
too
of
startling
vividness
moved
before
him
as
he
sat
there
with
eyes
scenes
of
the
imagined
arrest
the
scuffle
as
the
portrait
was
torn
away
and
anthony
burst
out
in
one
last
desperate
attempt
to
escape
he
saw
him
under
every
kind
of
circumstance
dashing
up
stairs
and
being
met
at
the
top
by
a
man
with
a
pike
running
and
crouching
through
the
itself
next
door
gliding
with
burning
eyes
past
the
in
a
rush
for
the
iron
gates
only
to
find
them
barred
on
horseback
with
his
hands
bound
and
a
despairing
uplifted
face
with
about
so
his
friend
dreamed
miserably
on
but
between
waking
and
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
until
the
crowning
vision
flashed
momentarily
before
his
eyes
of
the
scaffold
and
the
cauldron
with
the
fire
burning
and
the
low
gallows
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
the
butcher
block
and
knife
and
then
he
moaned
and
sat
up
and
stared
about
him
and
the
young
pursuivant
looked
at
him
towards
evening
the
house
grew
quieter
once
about
six
there
were
voices
outside
the
door
from
the
hall
was
unlocked
and
a
ruddy
man
came
in
with
two
pikemen
locking
the
door
behind
him
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
prisoner
and
he
watched
them
mechanically
as
they
went
round
the
room
running
their
eyes
up
and
down
the
panelling
and
tapping
here
and
there
the
room
has
been
searched
sir
already
said
the
young
constable
to
the
man
who
glanced
at
him
and
nodded
and
then
continued
the
scrutiny
they
reached
the
fireplace
and
the
officer
reached
up
and
tapped
the
wood
over
the
mantelpiece
times
here
he
called
pointing
to
a
spot
a
pikeman
came
up
placed
the
end
of
his
pike
into
the
oak
and
leaned
suddenly
and
heavily
upon
it
the
steel
crashed
in
an
inch
and
stopped
as
it
met
the
stonework
behind
the
officer
made
a
motion
the
pike
was
withdrawn
and
he
stood
on
and
put
his
finger
into
the
splintered
panel
then
he
was
satisfied
and
they
passed
on
still
tapping
the
walls
and
went
out
of
the
other
door
locking
it
again
behind
them
an
hour
later
there
were
voices
and
steps
again
and
a
door
was
unlocked
and
opened
and
graves
the
tonbridge
magistrate
stepped
in
alone
he
was
a
pale
man
with
large
eyes
and
a
weak
mouth
only
partly
covered
by
his
beard
you
can
go
he
said
nervously
to
the
constable
but
remain
outside
the
young
man
saluted
him
and
passed
out
the
magistrate
looked
quickly
and
sideways
at
buxton
as
he
sat
and
looked
at
him
i
am
come
to
tell
you
he
said
that
we
can
not
find
the
priest
he
hesitated
and
stopped
we
have
found
several
he
went
on
and
they
are
all
empty
i
i
hope
there
is
no
mistake
a
little
thrill
ran
through
the
man
who
sat
in
the
chair
the
lethargy
began
to
clear
from
his
brain
like
a
morning
mist
when
a
breeze
rises
he
sat
a
little
more
upright
and
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
he
said
nothing
yet
but
he
felt
power
and
resource
flowing
back
to
his
brain
and
the
pulse
in
his
temples
quieted
why
if
the
lad
had
not
been
taken
yet
he
must
surely
be
out
of
the
house
i
trust
there
is
no
mistake
said
the
magistrate
again
nervously
you
may
well
trust
so
said
the
other
it
will
be
a
grievous
thing
for
you
sir
otherwise
indeed
buxton
i
think
you
know
i
am
no
bigot
i
was
sent
for
by
lackington
last
night
i
could
not
refuse
it
was
not
my
wish
yet
you
have
issued
your
warrant
and
are
here
in
person
to
execute
it
may
i
inquire
how
many
of
my
cupboards
you
have
broken
into
and
i
hope
your
men
are
satisfied
with
my
plate
indeed
sir
said
the
magistrate
there
has
been
nothing
of
that
kind
and
as
for
the
cupboards
there
were
but
three
three
then
the
lad
is
out
of
the
house
thought
the
other
but
where
and
i
trust
you
have
not
spared
to
break
down
my
servants
rooms
and
the
stables
as
well
as
pierce
all
my
panelling
there
was
no
need
to
search
the
stables
buxton
our
men
were
round
the
house
before
we
entered
they
have
been
watching
the
entrances
since
eight
last
night
buxton
felt
bewildered
his
instinct
had
been
right
then
the
night
before
the
party
was
followed
from
near
wrotham
went
on
the
magistrate
the
priest
was
with
them
then
and
we
suppose
entered
the
house
you
suppose
snapped
the
other
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
supposing
you
have
looked
everywhere
and
can
not
find
him
the
magistrate
shrugged
his
shoulders
deprecatingly
as
he
stood
and
stared
at
the
angry
man
and
the
roofs
added
buxton
sneeringly
they
have
been
thoroughly
searched
then
there
is
but
one
possible
theory
he
reflected
the
lad
is
in
the
and
what
if
they
search
that
then
may
i
ask
what
you
propose
to
destroy
next
mr
graves
he
saw
that
this
tone
was
having
its
effect
on
the
magistrate
who
was
but
a
persecutor
with
but
feeble
convictions
and
will
as
he
knew
of
old
i
i
entreat
you
not
to
speak
to
me
like
that
sir
he
said
i
have
but
done
my
duty
then
the
other
rose
from
his
chair
and
his
eyes
were
stern
and
bright
again
and
his
lips
tight
your
duty
sir
seems
a
strange
matter
when
it
leads
you
to
break
into
a
friend
house
assault
him
and
his
servants
and
his
guests
and
destroy
his
furniture
in
search
of
a
supposed
priest
whom
you
have
never
even
seen
now
sir
if
this
matter
comes
to
her
grace
ears
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
for
you
know
mistress
corbet
her
is
one
of
my
and
speaking
of
that
where
are
my
guests
the
two
ladies
buxton
are
safe
and
sound
upstairs
i
assure
you
the
magistrate
voice
was
trembling
well
sir
i
have
one
condition
to
offer
you
either
you
and
your
men
withdraw
within
half
an
hour
from
my
house
and
grounds
and
leave
me
and
my
two
guests
to
ourselves
or
else
i
lay
the
whole
matter
through
mistress
corbet
before
her
grace
buxton
beat
his
hand
once
on
the
table
as
he
ended
and
looked
with
a
contemptuous
inquiry
at
the
magistrate
but
the
worm
writhed
up
at
the
heel
how
can
you
talk
like
this
sir
he
burst
out
as
if
you
had
but
two
guests
two
guests
i
do
not
understand
you
how
should
there
be
more
then
for
whom
are
the
four
places
laid
at
table
he
answered
indignantly
buxton
felt
a
sudden
desperate
sinking
and
he
could
not
answer
for
a
moment
the
magistrate
passed
his
shaking
hand
over
his
mouth
and
beard
once
or
twice
but
the
thrust
had
gone
home
and
there
was
no
parry
or
riposte
he
followed
it
up
now
sir
be
reasonable
i
came
in
here
to
make
terms
we
the
priest
has
been
here
it
is
certain
beyond
all
question
all
that
is
uncertain
is
whether
he
is
here
now
or
escaped
we
have
searched
thoroughly
we
must
search
again
but
in
the
meanwhile
while
you
yourself
must
be
under
restraint
your
guests
shall
have
what
liberty
they
wish
and
you
yourself
shall
have
all
reasonable
comfort
and
ease
so
so
if
we
do
not
find
the
priest
i
trust
that
you
and
and
mistress
corbet
will
agree
to
overlook
any
rashness
on
my
part
and
and
let
her
grace
remain
in
ignorance
buxton
had
been
thinking
furiously
during
this
little
speech
he
saw
the
mistake
he
had
made
in
taking
the
high
line
and
his
wretched
forgetfulness
of
the
fourth
place
at
table
he
must
make
terms
though
it
tasted
bitter
well
graves
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
be
hard
upon
you
all
i
ask
is
to
be
out
of
the
house
when
the
search
is
made
and
that
the
ladies
shall
come
and
go
as
they
please
the
magistrate
leapt
at
the
lure
like
a
trout
yes
yes
buxton
it
shall
be
as
you
say
and
to
what
house
will
you
retire
buxton
appeared
to
reflect
he
tapped
on
the
table
with
a
meditative
finger
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
it
must
not
be
too
far
away
he
said
slowly
and
and
the
rector
would
scarce
like
to
receive
me
perhaps
in
or
why
not
my
he
added
suddenly
graves
face
was
irradiated
with
smiles
thank
you
buxton
certainly
it
shall
be
as
you
say
and
where
is
the
it
is
across
the
garden
said
the
other
carelessly
i
wonder
you
have
not
searched
it
in
your
zeal
shall
i
send
a
man
to
prepare
it
asked
the
magistrate
eagerly
will
you
go
there
well
shall
we
go
across
there
together
now
i
give
you
my
parole
he
added
smiling
and
standing
up
indeed
as
you
wish
i
can
not
tell
you
sir
how
grateful
i
am
you
have
made
my
duty
almost
a
pleasure
sir
they
went
out
together
into
the
hall
buxton
carrying
the
key
of
the
that
he
had
taken
from
the
drawer
of
his
table
he
glanced
ruefully
at
the
wrecked
furniture
and
floor
and
his
eyes
twinkled
for
a
moment
as
they
rested
on
the
four
places
at
table
still
undisturbed
and
then
met
the
magistrate
sidelong
look
the
men
were
still
at
the
doors
resting
now
on
chairs
or
leaning
against
the
wall
with
their
weapons
beside
them
it
was
weary
work
this
mounting
sentry
and
losing
the
hunt
and
their
faces
showed
it
the
two
passed
out
together
into
the
garden
and
began
to
walk
up
the
path
that
led
straight
across
the
avenue
to
where
the
high
vanes
of
the
stood
up
grotesque
and
towering
against
the
evening
sky
above
the
black
all
the
while
they
went
buxton
was
thinking
out
his
plan
it
was
still
incoherent
but
at
any
rate
it
was
a
step
gained
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
anthony
again
and
at
least
the
poor
lad
should
have
some
supper
and
then
he
smiled
to
himself
with
relief
as
he
saw
what
an
improvement
there
had
been
in
the
situation
as
it
had
appeared
to
him
an
hour
ago
why
they
would
search
the
house
again
next
day
find
no
one
and
retire
apologising
his
occupancy
of
the
with
the
magistrate
full
consent
would
surely
secure
it
from
search
and
he
was
not
so
well
satisfied
with
the
disguised
entrance
to
the
passage
at
this
end
as
with
that
in
the
cellar
they
reached
the
door
at
last
there
were
three
steps
going
up
to
it
and
buxton
went
up
them
making
a
good
deal
of
noise
as
he
did
so
to
ensure
anthony
hearing
him
should
he
be
above
ground
then
as
if
with
great
difficulty
he
unlocked
the
door
rattling
it
and
clicking
sharply
with
his
tongue
at
its
stiffness
you
see
mr
graves
he
said
rather
loud
as
he
opened
the
door
a
little
my
prison
will
not
be
a
narrow
one
he
threw
the
door
open
gave
a
glance
round
and
was
satisfied
the
targets
leaned
against
one
wall
and
two
rows
of
stood
in
the
corner
near
where
the
window
opened
into
the
lane
but
there
was
no
sign
of
occupation
buxton
went
across
threw
the
window
open
and
looked
out
there
was
a
steel
cap
three
or
four
feet
below
and
a
and
at
the
sound
of
the
latch
a
bearded
face
looked
up
i
see
you
have
a
sentry
there
said
buxton
carelessly
ah
that
is
one
of
maxwell
men
mr
maxwell
said
the
other
startled
is
he
in
this
affair
too
yes
have
you
not
heard
he
came
from
great
keynes
this
morning
lackington
sent
for
him
buxton
face
grew
dark
ah
yes
i
see
a
pretty
revenge
the
magistrate
was
on
the
point
of
asking
an
explanation
for
he
felt
on
the
best
of
terms
again
now
with
his
prisoner
when
there
were
footsteps
outside
and
voices
and
there
stood
four
constables
with
nichol
hubert
maxwell
and
lackington
in
furious
debate
coming
up
the
path
behind
they
looked
up
suddenly
and
saw
the
door
open
and
the
magistrate
and
his
prisoner
standing
in
the
opening
the
four
constables
stood
waiting
for
further
orders
while
their
three
chiefs
came
up
now
now
now
said
graves
peevishly
what
is
all
this
we
have
come
to
search
this
house
sir
said
nichol
cheerfully
see
here
sir
said
hubert
have
you
given
orders
for
this
enough
enough
said
lackington
coolly
search
men
the
pursuivants
advanced
to
the
steps
then
buxton
turned
fiercely
on
them
all
see
here
he
cried
and
his
voice
rang
out
across
the
garden
you
bring
me
here
graves
promising
me
a
little
peace
and
quietness
after
your
violent
and
unwarranted
attack
upon
my
house
i
have
been
patient
and
submissive
to
all
suggestions
i
leave
my
entire
house
at
your
disposal
i
promise
to
lay
no
complaints
before
her
grace
so
long
as
you
will
let
me
retire
here
till
it
is
over
and
now
your
men
persecute
me
even
here
have
you
no
mind
of
your
own
sir
he
shouted
really
sir
began
hubert
and
as
for
you
maxwell
went
on
the
other
fiercely
are
you
not
content
with
your
triumph
so
far
can
not
you
leave
me
one
corner
to
myself
or
would
your
revenge
be
not
full
enough
for
you
then
you
mistake
me
sir
said
hubert
making
a
violent
effort
to
control
himself
i
am
on
your
side
in
this
matter
that
is
what
i
am
beginning
to
think
said
lackington
insolently
you
think
roared
buxton
and
who
the
devil
are
you
see
here
gentlemen
said
nichol
what
is
the
dispute
here
is
an
empty
house
buxton
tells
us
and
maxwell
tells
us
the
same
well
then
let
these
honest
fellows
run
through
the
empty
house
it
will
not
take
ten
minutes
and
buxton
and
his
friend
can
take
the
air
meanwhile
name
let
us
not
dispute
over
a
trifle
then
name
let
me
go
to
my
own
house
bellowed
buxton
and
these
gentlemen
can
have
the
empty
house
to
disport
themselves
in
till
doomsday
or
till
her
grace
looks
into
the
matter
and
he
made
a
motion
to
run
down
the
steps
but
his
heart
sank
graves
put
out
a
deprecating
hand
and
touched
his
arm
and
buxton
very
readily
turned
at
once
with
a
choleric
face
no
no
no
cried
the
magistrate
these
gentlemen
are
here
on
my
warrant
and
they
shall
not
search
the
place
buxton
i
entreat
you
not
to
be
hasty
come
back
sir
buxton
briskly
reascended
well
then
graves
i
entreat
you
to
give
your
orders
and
let
your

nichol
smoothly

step
forward

with
a
smile

sup
with
me

they
shall
assented
graves
maxwell

escort

here
hubert
who
was
turning
away
nodded
and
disappeared
round
the
lackington
who
had
been
talking
in
an
undertone
to
the
pursuivants
now
went
up
another
alley
with
one
of
them
and
nichol
and
disappeared
too
in
the
gathering
gloom
of
the
garden
the
other
two
pursuivants
separated
and
each
moved
a
few
steps
off
and
remained
just
out
of
sight
plainly
they
were
to
remain
on
guard
buxton
and
the
magistrate
sat
down
on
a
couple
of
that
is
an
obstinate
fellow
sir
said
graves
they
are
certainly
both
of
them
very
offensive
fellows
sir
i
was
astonished
at
your
indulgence
towards
them
the
magistrate
was
charmed
by
this
view
of
the
case
and
remained
talking
with
buxton
until
footsteps
again
were
heard
and
the
two
ladies
appeared
with
hubert
with
them
and
a
couple
of
men
carrying
each
a
tray
and
the
other
necessaries
he
had
asked
for
buxton
and
the
magistrate
rose
to
meet
the
ladies
and
bowed
i
can
not
tell
you
began
their
host
elaborately
what
distress
all
this
affair
has
given
me
i
trust
you
will
forgive
any
inconvenience
you
may
have
suffered
both
isabel
and
mary
looked
white
and
strained
but
they
responded
gallantly
and
as
the
table
was
being
prepared
the
four
talked
almost
as
if
there
were
no
bitter
suspense
at
three
of
their
hearts
at
least
graves
was
nervous
and
uneasy
but
did
his
utmost
to
propitiate
mary
at
last
he
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
when
buxton
entreated
him
to
sup
with
them
i
must
not
he
said
i
am
responsible
for
your
property
mr
buxton
then
i
understand
that
these
ladies
may
come
and
go
as
they
please
he
asked
carelessly
certainly
sir
then
may
i
ask
too
the
favour
that
you
will
place
one
of
your
own
men
at
the
door
who
can
conduct
them
to
the
house
when
they
wish
to
go
and
who
can
remain
and
protect
me
too
from
any
disturbance
from
either
of
the
two
officious
persons
who
were
here
just
now
graves
delighted
at
this
restored
confidence
promised
to
do
so
and
took
an
elaborate
leave
and
the
three
sat
down
to
supper
the
door
was
left
open
and
they
could
see
through
it
the
garden
over
which
veil
after
veil
of
darkness
was
beginning
to
fall
the
servants
had
lighted
two
tapers
and
the
inside
of
the
great
room
with
its
queer
furniture
of
targets
and
was
plainly
visible
to
any
walking
outside
once
or
twice
the
figure
of
a
man
crossed
the
strip
of
light
that
lay
across
the
gravel
it
was
a
strange
supper
they
said
innocent
things
to
one
another
in
a
tone
loud
enough
for
any
to
hear
who
cared
to
be
listening
about
the
annoyance
of
it
all
the
useless
damage
that
had
been
done
the
warmth
of
the
summer
night
and
the
like
and
spoke
in
low
soundless
sentences
of
what
was
in
all
their
hearts
that
fellow
said
mary
would
be
the
better
of
some
manners
he
is
in
the
passage
below
i
suppose
it
is
scarce
an
ennobling
life
that
of
a
manhunter
said
buxton
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
they
have
broken
your
little
cupboard
i
fear
said
mary
again
tell
me
your
plan
if
you
have
one
and
so
step
by
step
a
plan
was
built
up
it
had
been
maturing
in
buxton
mind
gradually
after
he
had
learnt
the
ladies
might
sup
with
him
and
little
by
little
he
conveyed
it
to
them
he
managed
to
write
down
the
outline
of
it
as
he
sat
at
table
and
then
passed
it
to
each
to
read
and
commented
on
it
and
answered
their
questions
about
it
all
in
the
same
noiseless
undertone
with
his
lips
indeed
scarcely
moving
there
were
many
additions
and
alterations
made
in
it
as
the
two
ladies
worked
upon
it
too
but
by
the
time
supper
was
over
it
was
tolerably
complete
it
seemed
indeed
almost
desperate
but
the
case
was
desperate
it
was
certain
that
the
would
be
searched
next
day
suspicions
were
plainly
roused
and
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
searchers
who
had
found
three
in
one
afternoon
would
fail
to
find
a
fourth
it
appeared
then
that
it
was
this
plan
or
none
they
supped
slowly
in
order
to
give
time
to
think
out
and
work
out
the
scheme
and
to
foresee
any
difficulties
beyond
those
they
had
already
counted
on
and
it
was
fully
nine
before
the
two
ladies
rose
their
host
went
with
them
to
the
door
called
up
graves
man
and
watched
them
pass
down
the
path
out
of
sight
he
stood
a
minute
or
two
longer
looking
across
towards
the
house
at
the
dusky
shapes
in
the
garden
and
the
strip
of
gravel
grass
and
yew
that
was
illuminated
from
his
open
door
then
he
spoke
to
the
men
that
he
knew
were
just
out
of
sight
i
am
going
to
bed
presently
kindly
do
not
disturb
me
there
was
no
answer
and
he
closed
the
two
high
doors
and
bolted
them
securely
he
dared
not
yet
do
what
he
wished
for
fear
of
arousing
suspicion
so
he
went
to
the
other
window
and
looked
out
into
the
lane
he
could
just
make
out
the
glimmer
of
steel
on
the
opposite
bank
my
man
he
called
out
cheerfully
again
there
was
no
answer
there
was
something
sinister
in
these
watching
presences
that
would
not
speak
and
his
heart
sank
a
little
as
he
the
window
without
closing
it
he
went
next
to
the
pile
of
rugs
and
pillows
that
his
men
had
brought
across
and
arranged
them
in
the
corner
just
clear
of
the
then
he
knelt
and
said
his
evening
prayers
and
here
at
least
was
no
acting
then
he
rose
again
and
took
off
his
doublet
and
ruff
and
shoes
so
that
he
was
dressed
only
in
a
shirt
trunks
and
hose
then
he
went
across
to
the
where
the
tapers
still
burned
and
blew
them
out
leaving
the
room
in
complete
darkness
then
he
went
back
to
his
bed
and
sat
and
listened
up
to
this
point
he
had
been
aware
that
probably
at
least
one
pair
of
eyes
had
been
watching
him
for
although
the
windows
were
of
glass
yet
it
was
exceedingly
likely
that
there
would
be
some
clear
glass
in
them
and
with
the
tapers
burning
inside
his
movements
would
all
have
been
visible
to
either
of
lackington
men
who
cared
to
put
his
eye
to
the
window
but
now
he
was
invisible
yet
as
he
thought
of
it
he
slipped
on
his
doublet
again
to
hide
the
possible
glimmer
of
his
white
shirt
there
was
the
silence
of
the
summer
night
about
him
the
silence
only
emphasised
by
its
faint
sounds
the
house
was
quiet
across
the
garden
though
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
heard
a
horse
stamp
once
there
came
a
little
stifled
cough
from
outside
his
window
there
was
the
silky
rustle
of
the
faint
breeze
in
the
trees
outside
and
now
and
again
came
the
snoring
of
a
young
owl
in
the
ivy
somewhere
overhead
he
counted
five
hundred
deliberately
to
compel
himself
to
wait
and
meanwhile
his
self
laboured
at
the
scheme
then
he
glanced
this
way
and
that
with
wide
eyes
his
ears
sang
with
intentness
of
listening
then
very
softly
he
shifted
his
position
and
found
with
his
fingers
the
ring
that
lifted
the
above
the
stairs
there
was
no
concealment
about
this
and
without
any
difficulty
he
lifted
the
door
with
his
right
hand
and
leaned
it
against
the
wall
then
he
looked
round
again
and
listened
from
below
came
up
the
damp
earthy
breath
of
the
basement
and
he
heard
a
rat
scamper
suddenly
to
shelter
then
he
lifted
his
feet
from
the
rugs
and
dropped
them
noiselessly
on
the
stairs
and
supporting
himself
by
his
hands
on
the
floor
went
down
a
step
or
two
then
a
stair
creaked
under
his
weight
and
he
stopped
in
an
agony
hearing
only
the
mad
throbbing
in
his
own
ears
but
all
was
silent
outside
and
so
step
by
step
he
descended
into
the
cool
darkness
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
should
close
the
or
not
there
was
a
risk
either
way
but
he
decided
to
do
so
as
he
would
be
obliged
to
make
some
noise
in
opening
the
secret
doors
and
communicating
with
anthony
at
last
his
feet
touched
the
earth
floor
and
he
turned
as
he
sat
and
counted
the
steps
the
fourth
the
fifth
and
tapped
upon
it
there
was
no
answer
he
put
his
lips
to
it
and
whispered
sharply
anthony
anthony
dear
lad
still
there
was
no
answer
then
he
lifted
the
lid
and
managed
to
hold
the
woodwork
below
as
he
knelt
on
the
third
step
so
that
it
descended
noiselessly
he
put
out
his
other
hand
and
felt
the
boards
anthony
had
retired
into
the
passage
then
he
told
himself
as
he
found
the
space
empty
he
climbed
into
the
hole
pushed
himself
along
and
counted
the
bricks
the
fourth
of
the
fourth
pressed
it
and
pushed
at
the
door
and
it
was
fast
for
the
first
time
a
horrible
spasm
of
terror
seized
him
had
he
forgotten
or
was
it
all
a
mistake
and
anthony
not
there
he
turned
in
his
place
put
his
shoulders
against
the
door
and
his
feet
against
the
woodwork
of
the
stairs
and
pushed
steadily
there
were
one
or
two
loud
creaks
and
the
door
began
to
yield
then
he
knew
anthony
was
there
a
rush
of
relief
came
into
his
heart
and
he
turned
and
whispered
again
anthony
dear
lad
anthony
open
quickly
it
is
i
the
brickwork
slid
back
and
a
hand
touched
his
face
out
of
the
pitch
darkness
of
the
tunnel
who
is
it
is
it
you
came
a
whisper
it
is
i
yes
thank
god
you
are
here
i
feared
how
could
i
tell
came
the
whisper
again
but
what
is
the
news
are
you
escaped
no
i
am
a
prisoner
and
on
parole
but
there
is
no
time
for
that
you
must
escape
we
have
a
plan
but
there
is
not
much
time
why
should
i
not
remain
here
they
will
search
and
and
this
end
of
the
tunnel
is
not
so
well
concealed
as
the
other
they
would
find
you
they
suspect
you
are
here
and
there
are
guards
round
this
place
there
was
a
movement
in
the
dark
then
why
think
began
the
whisper
no
no
we
have
a
plan
mary
and
isabel
approve
listen
carefully
there
is
but
one
guard
at
the
back
here
in
the
lane
mary
has
leave
to
come
and
go
now
as
she
pleases
they
are
afraid
of
her
she
will
leave
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
now
to
ride
to
east
maskells
with
two
grooms
and
a
maid
behind
one
of
them
she
will
ride
her
own
horse
when
she
has
passed
the
inn
she
will
bid
the
groom
who
has
the
maid
to
wait
for
her
while
she
rides
down
the
lane
with
the
other
robert
to
speak
to
me
through
the
window
the
pursuivant
we
suppose
will
not
forbid
that
as
he
knows
they
have
supped
with
me
just
now
as
we
talk
robert
will
watch
his
chance
and
spring
on
the
pursuivant
as
soon
as
the
struggle
begins
you
will
drop
from
the
window
it
is
but
eight
feet
and
help
him
to
secure
the
man
and
gag
him
however
much
din
they
make
the
others
can
not
reach
the
man
in
time
to
help
for
they
will
have
to
come
round
from
the
house
and
you
will
have
mounted
robert
horse
and
you
and
mary
together
will
gallop
down
the
lane
into
the
road
and
then
where
you
will
we
advise
east
maskells
i
do
not
suppose
there
will
be
any
pursuit
they
will
have
no
horses
ready
do
you
understand
it
there
was
silence
a
moment
buxton
could
hear
anthony
breathing
in
the
darkness
i
do
not
like
it
came
the
whisper
at
last
it
seems
desperate
a
hundred
things
may
happen
and
what
of
isabel
and
you
dear
friend
i
know
it
is
desperate
but
not
so
desperate
as
your
remaining
here
would
be
for
us
all
again
there
was
silence
what
of
robert
how
will
he
escape
if
you
escape
they
will
have
nothing
against
robert
for
they
can
prove
nothing
as
to
your
priesthood
but
if
they
catch
you
here
and
they
certainly
will
if
you
remain
here
they
will
probably
hang
him
for
he
fought
for
you
gallantly
in
the
house
and
he
too
will
have
time
to
run
he
can
run
through
the
door
into
the
meadows
but
they
will
not
care
for
him
if
they
know
you
are
off
again
silence
well
whispered
buxton
do
you
wish
it
i
think
it
is
the
only
hope
then
i
will
do
it
thank
god
and
now
you
must
come
up
with
me
put
off
your
shoes
i
have
none
then
follow
and
do
not
make
a
sound
very
cautiously
buxton
extricated
himself
for
he
had
been
lying
on
his
side
while
he
whispered
to
anthony
and
presently
was
crouched
on
the
stairs
above
as
he
heard
the
stirrings
of
his
friend
in
the
dark
below
him
there
came
the
click
of
the
brickwork
door
then
slow
shufflings
once
a
thump
on
the
hollow
boards
that
made
his
heart
leap
then
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
while
came
the
sound
of
latching
the
fifth
stair
into
its
place
and
he
felt
his
foot
grasped
then
he
turned
and
ascended
slowly
on
hands
and
knees
feeling
now
and
again
for
the
over
him
touched
it
raised
it
and
crawled
out
on
to
the
rugs
the
room
seemed
to
him
comparatively
light
after
the
heavy
darkness
of
the
basement
and
passage
below
and
he
could
make
out
the
and
the
outline
of
the
targets
on
the
opposite
wall
then
he
saw
a
head
follow
him
then
shoulders
and
body
and
anthony
crept
out
and
sat
on
the
rugs
beside
him
their
hands
met
in
a
trembling
grip
supper
dear
lad
whispered
buxton
with
his
mouth
to
the
ear
yes
i
am
hungry
came
the
faintest
whisper
back
buxton
rose
and
went
on
to
the
table
took
off
some
food
and
a
glass
of
wine
that
he
had
left
purposely
filled
and
came
back
with
them
there
the
two
friends
sat
buxton
could
just
hear
the
movement
of
anthony
mouth
as
he
ate
the
four
windows
glimmered
palely
before
them
and
once
or
twice
the
tall
doors
rattled
faintly
as
the
breeze
stirred
them
then
suddenly
came
a
sound
that
made
anthony
hand
pause
on
the
way
to
his
mouth
buxton
drew
a
sharp
breath
it
was
the
noise
of
three
or
four
horses
on
the
road
beyond
the
church
then
they
both
stood
up
without
a
word
and
buxton
went
noiselessly
across
to
the
window
that
looked
on
to
the
lane
and
remained
there
listening
the
horses
were
now
passing
down
the
street
and
the
noise
of
their
hoofs
grew
fainter
behind
the
houses
anthony
saw
his
friend
in
the
twilight
beckon
and
he
went
across
and
stood
by
him
suddenly
the
hoofs
sounded
loud
and
near
and
they
heard
the
pursuivant
below
stand
up
from
the
bank
opposite
then
mary
voice
came
distinct
and
cheerful
how
dark
it
is
the
horses
were
coming
down
the
lane
chapter
xii
the
the
sound
of
hoofs
came
nearer
anthony
heart
as
he
crouched
below
the
window
ready
to
spring
up
and
over
when
the
signal
was
given
beat
in
sick
thumpings
at
the
base
of
his
throat
but
with
a
fierce
excitement
and
no
fear
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
buxton
stood
back
a
little
waiting
he
must
feign
to
be
asleep
at
first
then
came
suddenly
a
sharp
challenge
from
the
sentry
it
is
mistress
corbet
came
mary
cool
high
tones
and
i
desire
to
speak
with
mr
buxton
the
man
hesitated

not
he
said
can
not
she
cried
why
fellow
do
you
know
who
i
am
and
i
have
just
supped
with
him
there
came
a
sudden
sound
from
the
other
side
of
the
and
both
men
in
the
room
knew
that
the
guards
in
the
garden
were
listening
i
am
sorry
madam
but
i
have
no
orders
then
do
not
presume

hound
came
mary
voice
again
with
a
ring
of
anger
ho
there
buxton
come
to
the
window
be
ready
he
whispered
to
anthony
stand
back
madam
said
the
pursuivant
or
i
shall
call
for
help
then
buxton
threw
back
the
window
who
is
there
he
asked
coolly
stand
up
anthony
it
is
i
buxton
but
this
insolent
dog
stand
madam
i
say
cried
the
voice
of
the
guard
then
from
the
garden
behind
came
running
footsteps
and
voices
and
a
red
light
shone
through
the
windows
behind
now
whispered
the
voice
over
anthony
head
sharply
there
came
a
loud
shout
from
the
guard
help
there
help
anthony
put
his
hands
on
to
the
sill
and
lifted
himself
easily
the
groom
had
slipped
from
his
horse
while
mary
held
the
bridle
and
was
advancing
at
the
guard
and
there
was
something
in
his
hand
the
sentry
who
was
standing
immediately
under
the
window
now
dropped
his
pike
point
forward
and
as
a
furious
rattling
began
at
the
doors
on
the
garden
side
anthony
dropped
and
came
down
astride
of
the
man
neck
who
crashed
to
the
ground
then
the
groom
was
on
him
too
leave
him
to
me
sir
mount
the
groom
hands
were
busy
with
something
about
the
struggling
neck
the
shouts
choked
and
ceased
you
will
strangle
the
man
said
anthony
sharply
nonsense
said
mary
mount
mount
they
are
coming
anthony
ran
to
the
horse
that
was
beginning
to
scurry
and
plunge
threw
himself
across
the
saddle
and
caught
the
reins
up
said
mary
up
and
he
slung
his
right
leg
over
the
flank
and
sat
up
as
mary
released
the
bridle
and
dashed
off
scattering
gravel
from
the
direction
of
the
church
came
cries
and
the
quick
rattle
of
a
galloping
horse
anthony
dashed
his
shoeless
heels
into
the
horse
sides
and
leaned
forward
and
in
a
moment
more
was
flying
down
the
lane
after
mary
from
in
front
came
a
shout
of
warning
with
one
or
two
screams
and
then
anthony
turned
the
corner
checking
his
horse
slightly
at
the
angle
saw
a
torch
somewhere
to
his
right
a
group
of
scared
faces
a
groom
and
woman
clinging
to
him
on
a
plunging
horse
and
the
white
road
and
then
found
himself
with
loose
reins
and
flying
stirrups
thundering
down
the
village
street
with
mary
on
her
horse
not
two
lengths
in
front
the
roar
of
the
hoofs
behind
and
of
the
little
shouting
crowd
with
the
screaming
woman
on
the
horse
died
behind
him
as
the
wind
began
to
boom
in
his
ears
mary
was
looking
round
now
and
slightly
checking
her
horse
as
they
neared
the
bottom
of
the
long
village
street
in
half
a
dozen
strides
anthony
came
up
on
her
right
then
the
pool
gleamed
before
them
just
beyond
the
fork
of
the
road
left
screamed
mary
through
the
roar
of
the
racing
air
and
turned
her
horse
off
up
the
road
that
led
round
in
a
wide
sweep
of
two
miles
to
east
maskells
and
the
woods
beyond
and
anthony
followed
he
had
settled
down
in
the
saddle
now
and
had
brought
his
maddened
horse
under
control
his
feet
were
in
the
stirrups
but
there
was
no
lessening
of
the
speed
they
had
left
the
last
house
now
and
on
either
side
the
black
bushes
and
heatherland
streamed
past
with
the
sudden
gleam
of
water
here
and
there
under
the
starlight
that
showed
the
ditches
and
holes
with
which
the
ground
on
either
side
of
the
road
was
honeycombed
then
mary
turned
her
head
again
and
the
words
came
detached
and
sharp
they
are
after
us
could
not
help
horses
saddled
anthony
turned
his
head
to
release
one
ear
from
the
roar
of
the
air
and
heard
the
thundering
rattle
of
hoofs
in
the
distance
but
even
as
he
listened
it
grew
fainter
we
are
gaining
he
shouted
mary
nodded
and
her
teeth
gleamed
white
in
a
smile
ours
are
fresh
she
screamed
then
there
was
silence
between
them
again
they
had
reached
a
little
hill
and
eased
their
horses
up
it
a
heavy
fringe
of
trees
crowned
it
on
their
right
black
against
the
stars
and
a
gleam
of
light
showed
the
presence
of
a
house
among
them
farther
and
farther
behind
them
sounded
the
hoofs
then
they
were
swaying
and
rocking
again
down
the
slope
that
led
to
the
long
flat
piece
of
road
that
ended
in
the
slope
up
to
east
maskells
it
was
softer
going
now
and
darker
too
as
there
were
trees
overhead
pollared
willows
streamed
past
them
as
they
went
and
twice
there
was
a
snort
and
a
hollow
thunder
of
hoofs
as
a
young
sleeping
horse
awoke
and
raced
them
a
few
yards
in
the
meadows
at
the
side
once
anthony
horse
shied
at
a
white
post
and
drew
in
front
a
yard
or
two
and
he
heard
for
a
moment
under
the
rattle
the
cool
gush
of
the
stream
that
flowed
beneath
the
road
and
the
scream
of
a
as
she
burst
from
the
reeds
a
great
exultation
began
to
fill
anthony
heart
what
a
ride
this
was
in
the
glorious
summer
night
reckless
and
intoxicating
what
a
contrast
this
sweet
night
air
streaming
past
him
this
dear
world
of
living
things
his
throbbing
horse
beneath
him
the
birds
and
beasts
round
him
and
this
gallant
girl
swaying
and
rejoicing
too
beside
him
what
a
contrast
was
all
this
to
that
terrible
afternoon
only
a
few
hours
away
of
suspense
and
skulking
like
a
rat
in
a
sewer
in
a
dark
close
passage
underground
breathing
death
and
silence
round
him
an
escape
with
the
fresh
air
in
the
face
and
the
glorious
galloping
music
of
hoofs
is
another
matter
to
an
escape
contrived
by
holding
the
breath
and
fearing
to
move
in
a
mean
and
as
all
this
flooded
in
upon
him
incoherently
but
overpoweringly
he
turned
and
laughed
loud
with
joy
they
had
nearly
come
to
an
end
of
the
flat
by
now
in
front
of
them
rose
the
high
black
mass
of
trees
where
safety
lay
somewhere
to
the
right
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
front
just
off
the
road
lay
east
maskells
they
would
draw
rein
he
reflected
when
they
reached
the
outer
gates
and
listen
and
if
all
was
quiet
behind
them
mary
at
least
should
ask
for
shelter
for
himself
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
to
ride
on
into
the
woods
for
the
present
he
began
to
move
his
head
as
he
rode
to
see
if
there
were
any
light
in
the
house
before
him
it
seemed
dark
but
perhaps
he
could
not
see
the
house
from
here
gradually
his
horse
slackened
a
little
as
the
rise
in
the
ground
began
and
he
tossed
the
reins
once
or
twice
then
there
was
a
sharp
hiss
and
blow
behind
him
his
horse
snorted
and
leapt
forward
almost
unseating
him
and
then
still
snorting
with
head
raised
and
jerking
dashed
at
the
slope
there
was
a
cry
and
a
loud
report
he
tugged
at
the
reins
but
the
horse
was
beside
himself
and
he
rode
fifty
yards
before
he
could
stop
him
even
as
he
wrenched
him
into
submission
another
horse
with
head
up
and
flying
stirrup
and
reins
thundered
past
him
and
disappeared
into
the
woods
beyond
the
house
then
trembling
so
that
he
could
hardly
hold
the
reins
he
urged
his
horse
back
again
at
a
stumbling
trot
towards
what
he
knew
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
and
to
meet
the
tumult
that
grew
in
nearness
and
intensity
up
the
road
along
which
he
had
just
galloped
there
was
a
dark
group
on
the
pale
road
in
front
of
him
twenty
yards
this
side
of
the
that
led
from
stanfield
place
he
took
his
feet
from
the
stirrups
as
he
got
near
and
in
a
moment
more
threw
his
right
leg
forward
over
the
saddle
and
slipped
to
the
ground
he
said
no
word
but
pushed
away
the
two
men
and
knelt
by
mary
taking
her
head
on
his
knee
the
men
rose
and
stood
looking
down
at
them
mary
he
said
can
you
hear
me
he
bent
close
over
the
white
face
her
hand
rose
to
her
breast
and
came
away
dark
she
was
shot
through
the
body
then
she
pushed
him
sharply
go
she
whispered
go
mary
he
said
again
make
your
confession
quickly
stand
back
you
men
they
obeyed
him
and
he
bent
his
ear
towards
the
mouth
he
could
so
dimly
see
there
was
a
sob
or
two
a
long
moaning
breath
and
then
the
murmur
of
words
very
faint
and
broken
by
gulps
for
breath
he
noticed
nothing
of
the
hoofs
that
dashed
up
the
road
and
stopped
abruptly
and
of
the
murmur
of
voices
that
grew
round
him
he
only
heard
the
gasping
whisper
the
words
that
rose
one
by
one
with
pauses
and
sighs
into
his
ear
is
that
all
he
said
and
a
silence
fell
on
all
who
stood
round
now
a
complete
circle
about
the
priest
and
the
penitent
the
pale
face
moved
slightly
in
assent
he
could
see
the
lips
were
open
and
the
breath
was
coming
short
and
agonised
nomine
his
hand
rose
above
her
and
moved
in
the
air
filii
et
spiritus
then
he
bent
low
again
and
looked
the
bosom
was
still
rising
and
falling
the
shut
eyes
lifted
once
and
looked
at
him
then
the
lids
fell
again
dei
omnipotentis
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
sancti
descendat
super
te
et
maneat
semper
then
there
fell
a
silence
a
horse
blew
out
its
nostrils
somewhere
behind
and
stamped
then
a
man
voice
cried
brutally
now
then
is
that
popish
mummery
done
yet
there
was
a
murmur
and
stir
in
the
group
but
anthony
had
risen
that
is
all
he
said
chapter
xiii
in
prison
anthony
found
several
friends
in
the
clink
prison
in
southwark
whither
he
was
brought
up
from
stanfield
place
after
his
arrest
life
there
was
very
strange
a
combination
of
suffering
and
extraordinary
relaxation
he
had
a
tiny
cell
nine
feet
by
five
with
one
little
window
high
up
and
for
the
first
month
of
his
imprisonment
wore
irons
at
the
same
time
his
gaoler
was
so
much
open
to
bribery
that
he
always
found
his
door
open
on
sunday
morning
and
was
able
to
shuffle
upstairs
and
say
mass
in
the
cell
of
ralph
emerson
once
the
companion
of
campion
and
a
of
the
society
of
jesus
there
he
met
a
large
number
of
catholics
some
of
whom
he
had
come
across
in
his
travels
and
he
even
ministered
the
sacraments
to
others
who
managed
to
come
in
from
the
outside
his
chief
sorrow
was
that
his
friend
and
host
had
been
taken
to
the
counter
in
wood
street
it
was
a
month
before
he
heard
all
that
had
happened
on
the
night
of
his
arrest
and
on
the
previous
days
he
had
been
separated
at
once
from
his
friends
and
although
he
had
heard
his
guards
talking
both
in
the
hall
where
he
had
been
kept
the
rest
of
the
night
and
during
the
long
hot
ride
to
london
the
next
day
yet
at
first
he
was
so
bewildered
by
death
that
what
they
said
made
little
impression
on
him
but
after
he
had
been
examined
both
by
magistrates
and
the
commissioners
and
very
little
evidence
was
forthcoming
his
irons
were
struck
off
and
he
was
allowed
much
more
liberty
than
before
and
at
last
to
his
great
joy
isabel
was
admitted
to
see
him
she
herself
had
come
straight
up
to
the
house
both
of
whom
still
lived
on
in
wharf
street
though
old
and
infirm
and
day
by
day
she
attempted
to
get
access
to
her
brother
until
at
last
by
dint
of
bribery
she
was
successful
then
she
told
him
the
whole
story
when
we
left
the
she
said
we
went
straight
back
and
mary
found
graves
in
the
parlour
off
the
hall
oh
anthony
how
she
ordered
him
about
and
how
frightened
he
was
of
her
the
end
was
that
he
sent
a
message
to
the
stables
for
her
horses
to
be
got
ready
as
she
said
i
went
up
with
her
to
help
her
to
make
ready
and
we
kissed
one
another
up
there
for
you
know
we
dared
not
make
as
if
we
said
downstairs
then
we
came
down
for
her
to
mount
and
then
we
saw
what
we
had
not
known
before
that
all
the
was
filled
with
the
horses
saddled
and
bridled
however
we
said
nothing
except
that
mary
asked
a
man
what
what
the
devil
he
was
looking
at
when
he
stared
up
at
her
as
she
stood
on
the
block
drawing
on
her
gloves
before
she
mounted
there
were
one
or
two
torches
burning
in
cressets
and
i
saw
her
so
plainly
turn
the
corner
down
towards
the
church
then
i
went
upstairs
again
but
i
could
not
go
to
my
room
but
stood
at
the
gallery
window
outside
looking
down
at
the
court
for
i
knew
that
if
there
was
any
danger
it
would
come
from
there
then
presently
i
heard
a
noise
and
a
shouting
and
a
man
ran
in
through
the
gates
to
the
and
almost
directly
it
seemed
three
or
four
rode
out
at
full
gallop
across
the
court
and
down
by
the
church
the
window
was
open
and
i
could
hear
the
noise
down
towards
the
village
then
more
and
more
came
pouring
out
and
all
turned
the
corner
and
galloped
all
but
one
whose
horse
slipped
and
came
down
with
a
crash
oh
anthony
how
i
prayed
then
i
saw
lackington
isabel
stopped
a
moment
at
the
name
and
then
went
on
again
and
he
was
on
horseback
too
in
the
court
but
he
was
shouting
to
two
or
three
more
who
were
just
mounting
the
field
across
the
field
them
off
i
could
hear
it
so
plainly
and
i
saw
the
was
open
and
they
went
through
and
i
could
hear
them
galloping
on
the
grass
and
then
i
knew
what
was
happening
and
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
shut
the
door
isabel
stopped
again
and
anthony
took
her
hand
softly
in
his
own
and
stroked
it
then
she
went
on
well
i
saw
them
bring
you
back
from
the
gallery
window
and
ran
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
saw
you
go
through
into
the
hall
where
the
magistrates
were
waiting
and
the
door
was
shut
and
then
i
went
back
to
my
place
at
the
window
and
then
presently
they
brought
in
mary
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
just
as
they
set
her
down
and
i
told
them
to
bring
her
upstairs
and
they
did
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
where
we
had
sat
together
all
the
afternoon
and
i
would
let
no
one
in
i
did
it
all
myself
and
then
i
set
the
tapers
round
her
and
put
the
crucifix
that
was
round
my
neck
into
her
fingers
which
i
had
laid
on
her
breast
and
there
she
lay
on
the
great
bed
and
her
face
was
like
a
child
fast
asleep
smiling
and
then
i
kissed
her
again
and
whispered
you
mary
for
though
i
did
not
know
all
i
knew
enough
and
that
it
was
for
you
anthony
had
thrown
his
arms
on
the
table
and
his
face
was
buried
in
them
isabel
put
out
her
hand
and
stroked
his
curly
head
gently
as
she
went
on
and
told
him
in
the
same
quiet
voice
of
how
mary
had
tried
to
save
him
by
lashing
his
horse
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
man
waiting
at
the
entrance
of
the
and
riding
in
between
him
and
anthony
the
man
had
declared
in
his
panic
of
fear
before
the
magistrates
that
he
had
never
dreamt
of
doing
mistress
corbet
an
injury
but
that
she
had
ridden
across
just
as
he
drew
the
trigger
to
shoot
the
priest
horse
and
stop
him
that
way
when
isabel
had
finished
anthony
still
lay
with
his
head
on
his
arms
why
anthony
my
darling
she
said
what
could
be
more
perfect
how
proud
i
am
of
you
both
she
told
him
too
how
they
had
been
tracked
to
stanfield
lackington
had
let
it
out
in
his
exultation
the
sailor
at
greenhithe
was
one
of
his
agents
an
apostate
like
his
master
he
had
recognised
that
the
party
consisted
of
catholics
by
anthony
breaking
of
the
bread
he
had
been
placed
there
to
watch
the
ferry
and
had
sent
messages
at
once
to
nichol
and
lackington
then
the
party
had
been
followed
but
had
been
lost
sight
of
thanks
to
ruse
nichol
had
then
flung
out
a
cordon
along
the
principal
roads
that
bounded
stanstead
woods
on
the
south
and
lackington
when
he
arrived
a
few
hours
later
had
kept
them
there
all
night
the
cordon
consisted
of
idlers
and
children
picked
up
at
wrotham
and
the
tramp
who
feigned
to
be
asleep
had
been
one
of
them
when
they
had
passed
he
had
given
the
signal
to
his
nearest
neighbour
and
had
followed
them
up
nichol
was
soon
at
the
place
and
after
them
and
had
followed
to
stanfield
with
lackington
behind
then
watchers
had
been
set
round
the
house
the
magistrates
communicated
with
and
as
soon
as
hubert
and
graves
had
arrived
the
assault
had
been
made
hubert
had
not
been
told
who
the
priest
was
but
he
had
leapt
at
an
opportunity
to
harass
buxton
he
had
been
given
to
understand
that
anthony
and
isabel
were
still
in
the
north
he
did
not
know
indeed
he
did
not
cried
isabel
piteously
at
another
time
when
she
had
gained
admittance
to
him
she
gave
him
messages
from
the
marretts
who
had
kept
a
great
affection
for
the
lad
who
had
told
them
tales
of
college
that
christmas
time
and
she
told
him
too
of
the
coming
of
an
old
friend
to
see
her
there
it
was
poor
dent
she
said
he
looks
so
old
now
his
wife
died
three
years
ago
you
know
he
has
a
and
does
chaplain
work
at
the
tower
sometimes
and
he
is
coming
to
see
you
anthony
and
talk
to
you
three
or
four
days
later
he
came
anthony
was
greatly
touched
at
his
kindness
in
coming
he
looked
considerably
older
than
his
age
his
hair
had
grown
thin
and
grey
about
his
temples
and
the
sharp
birdlike
outline
of
his
face
and
features
seemed
blurred
and
indeterminate
his
creed
too
and
his
whole
manner
of
looking
at
things
of
faith
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
similar
process
the
two
had
a
long
talk
i
am
not
going
to
argue
with
you
norris
he
said
though
i
still
think
your
religion
wrong
but
i
have
learnt
this
at
least
that
the
greatest
of
all
is
charity
and
if
we
love
the
same
god
and
his
blessed
son
and
one
another
i
think
that
is
best
of
all
i
have
learnt
that
from
my
wife
my
dear
wife
he
added
softly
i
used
to
hold
much
with
doctrine
at
one
time
and
loved
to
chop
arguments
but
our
saviour
did
not
and
so
i
will
not
anthony
was
delighted
that
he
took
this
line
for
he
knew
there
are
some
minds
that
apparently
can
not
be
loyal
to
both
charity
and
truth
at
the
same
time
and
dent
seemed
to
be
one
of
them
so
the
two
talked
of
old
times
at
great
keynes
and
of
the
folks
there
and
at
last
of
hubert
i
saw
him
in
the
city
last
week
said
dent
and
he
is
a
changed
man
he
looks
ten
years
older
than
this
time
last
year
i
scarcely
know
what
has
come
to
him
i
know
he
has
thrown
up
his
magistracy
and
the
lindfield
parson
tells
me
that
the
talk
is
that
maxwell
is
going
on
another
voyage
and
leaving
his
wife
and
children
behind
him
again
anthony
told
him
gently
of
hubert
share
in
the
events
at
stanfield
adding
what
real
and
earnest
attempts
he
had
made
to
repair
the
injury
he
had
done
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
that
it
was
his
friend
that
was
in
hiding
there
was
no
treachery
against
me
dent
you
see
he
added
dent
pecked
a
little
in
the
air
with
pursed
lips
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
a
vision
of
the
pulpit
at
great
keynes
moved
before
anthony
eyes
yes
yes
yes
he
said
i
understand
i
quite
understand
before
dent
took
his
leave
he
unburdened
himself
of
what
he
had
really
come
to
say
master
anthony
he
said
standing
up
and
fingering
his
hat
round
and
round
i
said
i
talked
no
doctrine
now
but
i
must
unsay
that
and
you
will
not
think
me
impertinent
if
i
ask
you
something
my
dear
dent
began
the
other
standing
and
smiling
too
thank
you
thank
you
i
felt
sure
then
it
is
this
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
popish
religion
though
i
used
to
once
and
i
may
be
very
mistaken
but
i
would
like
you
to
satisfy
me
before
i
go
on
one
point
and
he
fixed
his
anxious
peering
eyes
on
anthony
face
can
you
say
master
anthony
from
a
full
heart
that
you
fix
all
your
hope
and
confidence
for
salvation
in
christ
merits
alone
anthony
smiled
frankly
in
his
face
indeed
in
none
other
he
said
and
from
a
full
heart
ah
well
and
the
birdlike
face
began
to
beam
and
twitch
and
and
there
is
nothing
of
confidence
in
yourself
and
your
works
and
and
there
is
no
talk
of
holy
mary
in
the
matter
anthony
smiled
again
he
wished
to
avoid
useless
controversy
briefly
he
said
my
belief
is
that
i
am
a
very
great
sinner
that
i
deserve
eternal
hell
but
i
humbly
place
all
my
trust
in
the
precious
blood
of
my
saviour
and
in
that
alone
does
that
satisfy
you
dent
face
was
breaking
into
smiles
and
at
the
end
he
took
the
priest
face
in
his
hands
and
kissed
him
gently
twice
on
the
cheeks
then
my
dear
boy
i
fear
nothing
for
you
may
that
salvation
you
hope
for
be
yours
and
then
without
a
word
he
was
gone
anthony
conscience
reproached
him
a
little
that
he
had
said
nothing
of
the
church
to
the
minister
but
dent
had
been
so
peremptory
about
doctrine
that
it
was
hard
for
the
younger
man
to
say
what
he
would
have
wished
he
told
him
however
plainly
on
his
next
visit
that
he
held
too
that
the
catholic
church
was
the
treasury
of
grace
that
christ
had
instituted
and
added
a
little
speech
about
his
longing
to
see
his
old
friend
a
catholic
too
but
dent
shook
his
head
the
corners
of
his
eyes
wrinkled
a
little
and
a
shade
of
his
old
fretfulness
passed
over
his
face
nay
if
you
talk
like
that
he
said
i
must
be
gone
i
am
no
theologian
you
must
let
me
alone
he
gave
him
news
this
time
of
buxton
he
is
in
the
counter
as
you
know
he
said
and
is
a
very
bright
and
cheerful
person
it
seems
to
me
mistress
isabel
asked
me
to
see
him
and
give
her
news
of
him
for
she
can
not
get
admittance
he
is
in
a
cell
little
and
nasty
but
he
said
to
me
that
a
protestant
prison
was
a
papist
pleasaunce
in
fact
he
said
it
twice
and
he
asked
very
eagerly
after
you
and
mistress
isabel
he
tried
too
to
inveigle
me
into
talk
of
peter
his
prerogative
but
i
would
not
have
it
it
was
lammas
day
when
i
saw
him
and
he
spoke
much
of
it
anthony
asked
whether
there
was
anything
said
of
what
punishment
buxton
would
suffer
well
said
dent
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
told
me
that
her
grace
was
so
sad
at
the
death
of
mistress
corbet
that
she
was
determined
that
no
more
blood
should
be
shed
than
was
obliged
over
this
matter
and
that
buxton
he
thought
would
be
but
deprived
of
his
estates
and
banished
but
i
know
not
how
that
may
be
but
we
shall
soon
know
these
weeks
of
waiting
were
full
of
consolation
and
refreshment
to
anthony
the
nervous
stress
of
the
life
of
the
seminary
priest
in
england
full
of
apprehension
and
suspense
crowned
as
it
had
been
in
his
case
by
the
fierce
excitement
of
the
last
days
of
his
liberty
all
this
had
strained
and
distracted
his
soul
and
the
peace
of
the
prison
life
with
the
certainty
that
no
efforts
of
his
own
could
help
him
now
quieted
and
strengthened
him
for
the
ordeal
he
foresaw
at
this
time
too
he
used
to
spend
two
or
three
hours
a
day
in
meditation
and
found
the
greatest
benefit
in
following
the
tranquil
method
of
prayer
prescribed
by
louis
de
blois
with
whose
writings
he
had
made
acquaintance
at
douai
each
morning
too
he
said
a
dry
mass
and
during
the
whole
of
his
imprisonment
at
the
clink
managed
to
make
his
confession
at
least
once
a
week
and
besides
his
communion
at
mass
on
sundays
communicated
occasionally
from
the
reserved
sacrament
which
he
was
able
to
keep
in
a
neighbouring
cell
unknown
to
his
gaoler
and
so
the
days
went
by
as
orderly
as
in
a
religious
house
he
rose
at
a
fixed
hour
observed
the
greatest
exactness
in
his
devotions
and
did
his
utmost
to
prevent
any
visitors
being
admitted
to
see
him
or
any
from
another
cell
coming
into
his
own
until
he
had
finished
his
first
meditation
and
said
his
office
and
there
began
to
fall
upon
him
a
kind
of
mellow
peace
that
rose
at
times
of
communion
and
prayer
to
a
point
so
ravishing
that
he
began
to
understand
that
it
would
not
be
a
light
cross
for
which
such
preparatory
graces
were
necessary
towards
the
middle
of
september
he
received
intelligence
that
evidence
had
been
gathering
against
him
and
that
one
or
two
were
come
from
lancashire
under
guard
and
that
he
would
be
brought
before
the
commissioners
again
immediately
within
two
days
this
came
about
he
was
sent
for
across
the
water
to
the
tower
and
after
waiting
an
hour
or
two
with
his
gaoler
downstairs
in
the
basement
of
the
white
tower
was
taken
up
into
the
great
hall
where
the
council
sat
there
was
a
table
at
the
farther
end
where
they
were
sitting
and
as
anthony
looked
round
he
saw
through
openings
all
round
in
the
inner
wall
the
little
passage
where
the
sentries
walked
and
heard
their
footfalls
the
preliminaries
of
identification
and
the
like
had
been
disposed
of
at
previous
examinations
before
young
a
name
full
of
sinister
suggestiveness
to
the
catholics
and
so
after
he
had
been
given
a
seat
at
a
little
distance
from
the
table
behind
which
the
commissioners
sat
he
was
questioned
minutely
as
to
his
journey
in
the
north
of
england
what
were
you
there
for
mr
norris
inquired
the
secretary
of
the
council
i
went
to
see
friends
and
to
do
my
business
then
that
resolves
itself
into
two
heads
one
who
are
your
friends
two
what
was
your
business
now
it
had
been
established
beyond
a
doubt
at
previous
examinations
that
he
was
a
priest
a
student
of
douai
who
had
apostatised
had
positively
identified
him
so
anthony
answered
boldly
my
friends
were
catholics
and
my
business
was
the
reconciling
of
souls
to
their
creator
and
to
the
pope
of
rome
put
in
wade
who
is
christ
vicar
continued
anthony
and
a
pestilent
knave
concluded
a
man
whom
anthony
did
not
know
but
the
commissioners
wanted
more
than
that
it
was
true
that
anthony
was
already
convicted
of
high
treason
in
having
been
ordained
beyond
the
seas
and
in
exercising
his
priestly
functions
in
england
but
the
exacting
of
the
penalty
for
religion
alone
was
apt
to
raise
popular
resentment
and
it
was
far
preferable
in
the
eyes
of
the
authorities
to
entangle
a
priest
in
the
political
net
before
killing
him
so
they
passed
over
for
the
present
his
priestly
functions
and
first
demanded
a
list
of
all
the
places
where
he
had
stayed
in
the
north
you
ask
what
is
impossible
said
anthony
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
his
heart
beating
sharply
for
he
knew
that
now
peril
was
near
well
said
wade
let
us
put
it
another
way
we
know
that
you
were
at
speke
hall
blainscow
and
other
places
i
have
a
list
here
and
he
tapped
the
table
but
we
want
your
name
to
it
let
me
see
the
paper
said
anthony
nay
nay
tell
us
first
i
can
not
sign
the
paper
except
i
see
it
said
anthony
smiling
give
it
him
said
a
voice
from
the
end
of
the
table
here
then
said
wade
unwillingly
anthony
got
up
and
took
the
paper
from
him
and
saw
one
or
two
places
named
where
he
had
not
been
and
saw
that
it
had
been
drawn
up
at
any
rate
partly
on
guesswork
he
put
the
paper
down
and
went
back
to
his
chair
and
sat
down
it
is
not
true
he
said
looking
steadily
at
the
secretary
i
can
not
sign
it
do
you
deny
that
you
have
been
to
any
of
these
places
inquired
wade
indignantly
the
paper
is
not
true
said
anthony
again
well
then
show
us
what
is
not
true
upon
it
i
can
not
we
will
find
means
to
persuade
you
said
the
secretary
if
god
permits
said
anthony
wade
glanced
round
inquiringly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
one
or
two
shook
their
heads
well
then
we
will
turn
to
another
point
there
are
known
to
have
been
certain
jesuit
priests
in
lancashire
in
november
of
last
year
do
you
deny
that
sir
you
ask
too
much
said
anthony
smiling
again
they
may
have
been
there
for
aught
i
know
for
i
certainly
did
not
see
them
elsewhere
at
the
time
you
mention
wade
frowned
but
the
one
at
the
end
laughed
loud
he
has
you
there
wade
he
said
this
is
foolery
said
the
secretary
well
these
two
father
edward
oldcorne
and
father
holtby
were
in
lancashire
in
november
and
you
norris
spoke
with
them
then
we
wish
to
know
where
they
are
now
and
you
must
tell
us
you
have
yet
to
prove
that
i
spoke
with
them
said
anthony
for
the
trap
was
too
transparent
but
we
know
that
that
may
or
may
not
be
but
it
is
for
you
to
prove
it
nay
for
you
to
tell
us
for
you
to
prove
it
wade
lost
his
temper
well
then
he
cried
take
this
paper
and
see
which
of
us
is
in
the
right
anthony
rose
again
wondering
what
the
paper
could
be
and
came
towards
the
table
he
saw
it
bore
a
name
at
the
end
and
as
he
advanced
saw
that
it
had
an
official
appearance
wade
still
held
it
but
anthony
took
it
in
his
hand
too
to
steady
it
and
began
to
read
but
as
he
read
a
mist
rose
before
his
eyes
and
the
paper
shook
violently
it
was
a
warrant
to
put
him
to
the
torture
wade
laughed
a
little
why
see
norris
how
you
tremble
at
the
warrant
what
will
it
be
when
you
but
a
voice
murmured
shame
and
he
stopped
and
stared
anthony
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
went
back
to
his
chair
and
sat
down
he
saw
his
knees
trembling
as
he
sat
and
hated
himself
for
it
but
he
cried
bravely
the
flesh
is
weak
but
please
god
the
spirit
is
willing
well
then
said
wade
again
must
we
execute
this
warrant
or
will
you
tell
us
what
we
would
know
you
must
do
what
god
permits
said
anthony
wade
sat
down
throwing
the
warrant
on
the
table
and
began
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
to
those
who
sat
next
him
anthony
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
did
his
utmost
to
keep
his
thoughts
steady
now
he
realised
where
he
was
and
what
it
all
meant
the
little
door
to
the
left
behind
him
that
he
had
noticed
as
he
came
in
was
the
door
of
which
he
had
heard
other
catholics
speak
that
led
down
to
the
great
crypt
where
so
many
before
him
had
screamed
and
fainted
and
called
on
god
from
the
rack
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
or
from
the
pillar
with
the
fixed
ring
at
its
summit
he
had
faced
all
this
in
his
mind
again
and
again
but
it
was
a
different
thing
to
have
the
horror
within
arm
length
old
phrases
he
had
heard
of
the
torture
rang
in
his
mind
a
boast
of
norton
the
rackmaster
who
had
racked
brian
and
which
had
been
repeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
he
had
made
brian
a
foot
longer
than
god
made
him
words
of
james
maxwell
that
he
had
let
drop
at
douai
the
remembrance
of
his
limp
and
of
campion
powerlessness
to
raise
his
hand
when
called
upon
to
swear
all
these
things
crowded
on
him
now
and
there
seemed
to
rest
on
him
a
crushing
swarm
of
fearful
images
and
words
he
made
a
great
effort
and
closed
his
eyes
and
repeated
the
holy
name
of
jesus
over
and
over
again
but
the
struggle
was
still
fierce
when
wade
voice
harsh
and
dry
broke
in
and
scattered
the
confusion
of
mind
that
bewildered
him
take
the
prisoner
to
a
cell
he
is
not
to
go
back
to
the
clink
anthony
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
the
gaoler
was
looking
at
him
with
compassion
come
sir
he
said
anthony
rose
feeling
heavy
and
exhausted
but
remembered
to
bow
to
the
commissioners
one
or
two
of
whom
returned
it
then
he
followed
the
gaoler
out
into
the
who
handed
him
over
to
one
of
the
tower
officials
i
must
leave
you
here
sir
he
said
but
keep
a
good
heart
it
will
not
be
for
when
anthony
got
to
his
new
cell
which
was
in
the
salt
tower
he
was
bitterly
angry
and
disappointed
with
himself
why
he
had
turned
white
and
sick
like
a
child
not
at
the
pain
of
the
rack
not
even
at
the
sight
of
it
but
at
the
mere
warrant
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
bowed
down
till
his
head
beat
against
the
boards
o
lord
jesus
he
prayed
give
me
of
thy
manhood
he
found
that
this
prison
was
more
rigorous
than
the
clink
no
liberty
to
leave
the
cell
could
possibly
be
obtained
and
no
furniture
was
provided
the
gaoler
when
he
had
brought
up
his
dinner
asked
whether
he
could
send
any
message
for
him
for
a
bed
anthony
gave
isabel
address
knowing
that
the
authorities
were
already
aware
that
she
was
a
catholic
and
indeed
she
had
given
bail
to
come
up
for
trial
if
called
upon
and
that
his
information
could
injure
neither
her
nor
the
marretts
who
were
sound
church
of
england
people
and
in
the
afternoon
a
mattress
and
some
clothes
arrived
for
him
anthony
noticed
at
dinner
that
the
knife
provided
was
of
a
very
inconvenient
shape
having
a
round
blunt
point
and
being
sharp
only
at
a
lower
part
of
the
blade
and
when
the
keeper
came
up
with
his
supper
he
asked
him
to
bring
him
another
kind
the
man
looked
at
him
with
a
queer
expression
what
is
the
matter
asked
anthony
can
not
you
oblige
me
the
man
shook
his
head
they
are
the
knives
that
are
always
given
to
prisoners
under
warrant
for
torture
anthony
did
not
understand
him
and
looked
at
him
puzzled
for
fear
they
should
do
themselves
an
injury
added
the
gaoler
then
the
same
shudder
ran
over
his
body
again
you
mean
you
mean
he
began
the
gaoler
nodded
still
looking
at
him
oddly
and
went
out
and
anthony
sat
with
his
supper
untasted
staring
before
him
by
a
kind
of
violent
reaction
he
had
a
long
happy
dream
that
night
the
fierce
emotions
of
that
day
had
swept
over
his
imagination
and
scoured
it
as
with
fire
and
now
the
underlying
peace
rose
up
and
flooded
it
with
sweetness
he
thought
he
was
in
the
north
again
high
up
on
a
moor
walking
with
one
who
was
quite
familiar
to
him
but
whose
person
he
could
not
remember
when
he
woke
he
did
not
even
know
whether
it
was
man
or
woman
it
was
a
perfect
autumn
day
he
thought
like
one
of
those
he
had
spent
there
last
year
the
heather
and
the
gorse
were
in
flower
and
the
air
was
redolent
from
their
blossoms
he
commented
on
this
to
the
person
at
his
side
who
told
him
it
was
always
so
there
mile
after
mile
the
moor
rose
and
dipped
and
although
skiddaw
was
on
his
right
purple
and
grey
yet
to
his
left
there
was
a
long
curved
horizon
of
sparkling
blue
sea
it
was
a
cloudless
day
overhead
and
the
air
seemed
kindling
and
fresh
round
him
as
it
blew
across
the
stretches
of
heather
from
the
western
sea
he
himself
felt
full
of
an
extraordinary
vitality
and
the
mere
movement
of
his
limbs
gave
him
joy
as
he
went
swiftly
and
easily
forward
over
the
heather
there
was
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
his
ears
and
again
and
again
there
came
the
gush
of
water
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
as
he
had
heard
it
in
the
church
by
skiddaw
there
was
no
house
or
building
of
any
kind
within
sight
and
he
felt
a
great
relief
in
these
miles
of
heath
and
the
sense
of
holiday
that
they
gave
him
but
all
the
joy
round
him
and
in
his
heart
found
their
point
for
him
in
the
person
that
went
with
him
this
presence
was
their
centre
as
a
diamond
in
a
gold
ring
or
as
a
throned
figure
in
a
court
circle
all
else
existed
for
the
sake
of
this
person
the
heather
blossomed
and
the
gorse
incensed
the
air
and
the
sea
sparkled
and
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
air
kindled
and
his
own
heart
warmed
and
throbbed
for
that
only
when
he
tried
to
see
who
it
was
there
was
nothing
to
see
the
presence
existed
there
as
a
centre
in
a
sphere
immeasurable
and
indiscernible
sometimes
he
thought
it
was
mary
sometimes
he
thought
it
henry
buxton
sometimes
isabel
once
even
he
assured
himself
it
was
mistress
margaret
and
once
james
maxwell
and
with
the
very
act
of
identification
came
indecision
again
this
uncertainty
waxed
into
a
torment
and
yet
a
sweet
torment
as
of
a
lover
who
watches
his
mistress
shuttered
house
and
this
torment
swelled
yet
higher
and
deeper
until
it
was
so
great
that
it
had
absorbed
the
whole
radiant
fragrant
circle
of
the
hills
where
he
walked
and
then
came
the
blinding
knowledge
that
the
presence
was
all
these
persons
so
dear
to
him
and
far
more
that
every
tenderness
and
grace
that
he
had
loved
in
them
mary
gallantry
and
isabel
serene
silence
and
his
fellowship
and
the
rest
floated
in
the
translucent
depths
of
it
stained
and
irradiated
by
it
as
motes
in
a
sunbeam
and
then
he
woke
and
it
was
through
tears
of
pure
joy
that
he
saw
the
rafters
overhead
and
the
great
barred
door
and
the
discoloured
wall
above
his
bed
when
his
gaoler
brought
him
dinner
that
day
it
was
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
and
when
anthony
asked
him
the
reason
he
said
that
he
did
not
know
but
that
the
orders
had
run
so
but
that
norris
might
take
heart
it
was
not
for
the
torture
for
topcliffe
who
superintended
it
had
told
the
keeper
of
the
that
nothing
would
be
wanted
that
day
he
had
hardly
finished
dinner
when
the
gaoler
came
up
again
and
said
that
the
lieutenant
was
waiting
for
him
below
and
that
he
must
bring
his
hat
and
cloak
since
his
arrest
he
had
worn
his
priest
habit
every
day
so
he
now
threw
the
cloak
over
his
arm
and
took
his
hat
and
followed
the
gaoler
down
in
passing
through
the
court
he
went
by
a
group
of
men
that
were
talking
together
and
he
noticed
very
especially
a
tall
old
man
with
a
grey
head
in
a
court
suit
with
a
sword
and
very
lean
about
the
throat
who
looked
at
him
hard
as
he
passed
as
he
reached
the
archway
where
the
lieutenant
was
waiting
he
turned
again
and
saw
the
sunken
eyes
of
the
old
man
still
looking
after
him
when
he
turned
to
the
gaoler
he
saw
the
same
odd
look
in
his
face
that
he
had
noticed
before
why
do
you
look
like
that
he
asked
who
is
that
old
man
that
is
topcliffe
said
the
keeper
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
sir
richard
barkley
saluted
him
kindly
at
the
gate
and
begged
him
to
follow
him
the
keeper
still
came
after
and
another
stepped
out
and
joined
them
and
the
group
of
four
together
passed
out
through
the
lion
tower
and
across
the
moat
to
a
little
doorway
where
a
closed
carriage
was
waiting
the
lieutenant
and
anthony
stepped
inside
the
two
keepers
mounted
outside
and
the
carriage
set
off
then
the
lieutenant
turned
to
the
priest
do
you
know
where
you
are
going
mr
norris
no
sir
you
are
going
to
whitehall
to
see
the
queen
grace
chapter
xiv
an
open
door
when
the
carriage
reached
the
palace
they
were
told
that
the
queen
was
not
yet
come
from
greenwich
and
they
were
shown
into
a
little
next
the
gallery
where
the
interview
was
to
take
place
the
queen
the
lieutenant
told
anthony
was
to
come
up
that
afternoon
passing
through
london
and
that
she
had
desired
to
see
him
on
her
way
through
to
nonsuch
he
could
not
tell
him
why
he
was
sent
for
though
he
conjectured
it
was
because
of
mistress
corbet
death
and
that
her
grace
wished
to
know
the
details
however
said
the
lieutenant
you
now
have
your
opportunity
to
speak
for
yourself
and
i
think
you
a
very
fortunate
man
norris
few
have
had
such
a
privilege
though
i
remember
that
campion
had
it
too
though
he
made
poor
use
of
it
anthony
said
nothing
his
mind
was
throbbing
with
memories
and
associations
the
air
of
state
and
luxury
in
the
corridors
through
which
he
had
just
come
the
discreet
guarded
doors
the
servants
in
the
royal
liveries
standing
here
and
there
the
sense
of
expectancy
that
mingled
with
the
solemn
hush
of
the
palace
all
served
to
bring
up
the
figure
of
mary
corbet
whom
he
had
seen
so
often
in
these
circumstances
and
the
thought
of
her
made
the
peril
in
which
he
stood
and
the
hope
of
escape
from
it
seem
very
secondary
matters
he
walked
to
the
window
presently
and
looked
out
upon
the
little
court
below
one
of
the
innumerable
yards
of
that
vast
palace
and
stood
staring
down
on
the
hound
that
was
chained
there
near
one
of
the
entrances
and
that
yawned
and
blinked
in
the
autumn
sunshine
even
as
he
looked
the
dog
paused
in
the
middle
of
his
stretch
and
stood
expectant
with
his
ears
cocked
a
servant
dashed
bareheaded
down
a
couple
of
steps
and
out
through
the
low
archway
and
simultaneously
anthony
heard
once
more
the
sweet
shrill
trumpets
that
told
of
the
approach
then
there
came
the
roll
of
drums
and
the
thunder
of
feet
and
the
noise
of
wheels
the
trumpets
sang
out
again
nearer
and
the
rumbling
waxed
louder
as
the
queen
cavalcade
out
of
sight
passed
the
entrance
of
the
archway
down
upon
which
anthony
looked
and
then
stilled
and
the
palace
itself
began
to
hum
and
stir
a
door
or
two
banged
in
the
distance
feet
ran
past
the
door
of
the
and
the
strain
of
the
trumpets
sounded
once
in
the
house
itself
then
all
grew
quiet
once
more
and
anthony
turned
from
the
window
and
sat
down
again
by
the
lieutenant
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
the
lieutenant
stroked
his
beard
gently
and
said
a
word
or
two
under
his
breath
now
and
again
to
anthony
once
or
twice
there
came
the
swift
rustle
of
a
dress
outside
as
a
lady
hurried
past
then
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
and
shutting
then
more
silence
then
the
sound
of
low
talking
and
at
last
the
sound
of
footsteps
going
slowly
up
and
down
the
gallery
which
adjoined
the
still
the
minutes
passed
but
no
summons
came
anthony
rose
and
went
to
the
window
again
for
in
spite
of
himself
this
waiting
told
upon
him
the
dog
had
gone
back
to
his
kennel
and
was
lying
with
his
nose
just
outside
the
opening
anthony
wondered
vacantly
to
himself
what
door
it
was
that
he
was
guarding
and
who
lived
in
the
rooms
that
looked
out
beside
it
then
suddenly
the
door
from
the
gallery
opened
and
a
page
appeared
the
queen
grace
will
see
norris
alone
anthony
went
towards
him
and
the
page
opened
the
door
wide
for
him
to
go
through
and
then
closed
it
noiselessly
behind
him
and
anthony
was
in
the
presence
it
was
with
a
sudden
bewilderment
that
he
recognised
he
was
in
the
same
gallery
as
that
in
which
he
had
talked
and
sat
with
mary
corbet
there
were
the
long
tapestries
hanging
opposite
him
with
the
tall
three
windows
dividing
them
and
the
suits
of
steel
armour
that
he
remembered
he
even
recalled
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
across
which
mary
corbet
had
come
forward
to
meet
him
and
that
still
lay
before
the
tall
window
at
the
end
that
looked
on
to
the
the
sun
was
passing
round
to
the
west
now
and
shone
again
across
the
golden
haze
of
the
yard
through
this
great
window
with
the
fragments
of
stained
glass
at
the
top
the
memory
leapt
into
life
even
as
he
stepped
out
and
stood
for
a
moment
dazed
in
the
sunshine
at
the
door
that
opened
from
the
but
the
figure
that
turned
from
the
window
and
faced
him
was
not
like
mary
it
was
the
figure
of
an
old
woman
who
looked
tall
with
her
towering
and
nodding
plume
she
was
dressed
in
a
great
dark
red
mantle
thrown
back
on
her
shoulders
and
beneath
it
was
a
pale
yellow
dress
sown
all
over
with
queer
devices
on
the
puffed
sleeve
of
the
arm
that
held
the
stick
was
embroidered
a
great
curling
snake
that
shone
with
gold
thread
and
jewels
in
the
sunlight
and
powdered
over
the
skirt
were
representations
of
human
eyes
and
other
devices
embroidered
with
dark
thread
that
showed
up
plainly
on
the
pale
ground
so
much
he
saw
down
one
side
of
the
figure
on
which
the
light
shone
the
rest
was
to
his
dazzled
eyes
in
dark
shadow
he
went
down
on
his
knees
at
once
before
this
tremendous
figure
seeing
the
buckled
feet
that
twinkled
below
the
skirt
cut
short
in
front
and
remained
there
there
was
complete
silence
for
a
moment
while
he
felt
the
queen
looking
at
him
and
then
the
voice
he
remembered
only
older
and
harsher
now
said
what
is
all
this
mr
norris
anthony
looked
for
a
moment
and
saw
the
queen
eyes
fixed
on
him
but
he
said
nothing
and
looked
down
again
stand
up
said
the
queen
not
unkindly
and
walk
with
me
anthony
stood
up
at
once
and
heard
the
stiff
rustle
of
her
dress
and
the
tap
of
her
heels
and
stick
on
the
polished
boards
as
she
came
towards
him
then
he
turned
with
her
down
the
long
gallery
until
this
moment
ever
since
he
had
heard
that
he
was
to
see
the
queen
he
had
felt
nervous
and
miserable
but
now
this
had
left
him
and
he
felt
at
his
ease
to
be
received
in
this
way
in
privacy
and
to
accompany
her
up
and
down
the
gallery
as
she
took
her
afternoon
exercise
was
less
embarrassing
than
the
formal
interview
he
had
expected
the
two
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
gallery
without
a
word
and
it
was
not
until
they
turned
and
faced
the
end
that
looked
on
to
the
that
the
queen
spoke
and
her
voice
was
almost
tender
i
understand
that
you
were
with
minnie
corbet
when
she
died
she
said
she
died
for
me
your
grace
said
anthony
the
queen
looked
at
him
sharply
tell
me
the
tale
she
said
and
anthony
told
her
the
whole
story
of
the
escape
and
the
ride
speaking
too
for
his
friend
buxton
and
of
mary
affection
for
him
your
grace
he
ended
it
sounds
a
poor
tale
of
a
man
that
a
woman
should
die
for
him
so
but
i
can
say
with
truth
that
with
god
grace
i
would
have
died
a
hundred
deaths
to
save
her
the
queen
was
silent
for
a
good
while
when
the
story
was
over
and
anthony
thought
that
perhaps
she
could
not
speak
but
he
dared
not
look
at
her
then
she
spoke
very
harshly
and
you
norris
why
did
you
not
escape
your
grace
would
not
have
done
so
when
i
saw
that
she
was
dying
i
would
not
if
you
had
been
a
priest
your
grace
what
is
that
asked
the
queen
suddenly
facing
him
i
am
a
priest
madam
and
she
was
a
catholic
and
my
duty
was
beside
her
eh
i
shrived
her
your
grace
before
she
died
why
they
did
not
tell
me
that
anthony
was
silent
they
walked
on
a
few
steps
and
the
queen
stood
silent
too
looking
down
upon
the
then
she
turned
abruptly
and
anthony
turned
with
her
and
they
began
to
go
up
and
down
again
it
was
gallant
of
you
both
she
said
shortly
i
love
that
my
people
should
be
of
that
sort
then
she
paused
tell
me
she
went
on
did
mary
love
me
anthony
was
silent
for
a
moment
the
truth
norris
she
said
mistress
corbet
was
loyalty
itself
he
answered
nay
nay
nay
not
loyalty
but
love
i
asked
you
of
how
did
she
speak
of
me
well
your
grace
mistress
corbet
had
a
shrewd
wit
and
she
used
it
freely
on
friend
and
foe
but
her
very
sharpness
on
your
grace
sometimes
showed
her
love
for
she
hated
to
think
you
otherwise
than
what
she
deemed
the
best
the
queen
stopped
full
in
her
walk
that
is
very
pleasantly
put
she
said
i
told
minnie
you
were
a
courtier
again
the
two
walked
on
then
she
used
her
tongue
on
me
your
grace
i
have
never
met
one
on
whom
she
did
not
but
her
heart
was
true
i
know
that
i
know
that
norris
tell
me
something
she
said
anthony
racked
his
brains
for
something
not
too
severe
mistress
corbet
once
said
that
the
queen
most
disobedient
subject
was
herself
eh
said
elizabeth
stopping
in
her
walk
said
mistress
corbet
can
never
command
herself
finished
anthony
the
queen
looked
at
anthony
puzzled
a
moment
and
then
chuckled
loudly
in
her
throat
the
impertinent
minx
she
said
that
was
when
i
had
clouted
her
no
doubt
again
they
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
a
little
while
anthony
began
to
wonder
whether
this
was
all
for
which
the
queen
had
sent
for
him
he
was
astonished
at
his
own
all
the
trembling
awe
with
which
he
had
faced
the
queen
at
greenwich
was
gone
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
even
his
own
peril
and
he
felt
instead
even
something
of
pity
for
this
passionate
old
woman
who
had
aged
so
quickly
whose
favourites
one
by
one
were
dropping
off
or
at
the
best
giving
her
only
an
exaggerated
and
ridiculous
devotion
at
the
absurdity
of
which
all
the
world
laughed
here
was
this
old
creature
at
his
side
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
adventurers
advancing
through
the
world
in
splendid
and
jewelled
raiment
with
trumpets
blowing
before
her
and
poets
singing
her
praises
and
crowds
applauding
in
the
streets
and
sneering
in
their
own
houses
at
the
withered
old
who
still
thought
herself
a
diana
and
all
the
while
this
triumphal
progress
was
at
the
expense
of
god
church
her
car
rolled
over
the
bodies
of
his
servants
and
her
shrunken
gemmed
fingers
were
red
in
their
blood
so
she
advanced
thought
anthony
day
by
day
towards
the
black
truth
and
the
eternal
loneliness
of
the
darkness
that
lies
outside
the
realm
where
christ
only
is
king
elizabeth
broke
in
suddenly
on
his
thoughts
now
she
said
and
what
of
you
mr
norris
i
am
your
grace
servant
he
said
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
said
elizabeth
if
you
are
my
servant
why
are
you
a
priest
contrary
to
my
laws
because
i
am
christ
servant
too
your
grace
but
christ
apostle
said
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you
in
indifferent
matters
madam
the
queen
frowned
and
made
a
little
angry
sound
i
can
not
understand
you
papists
said
the
queen
what
name
do
you
want
you
have
liberty
of
thought
and
faith
i
desire
to
inquire
into
no
man
private
opinions
you
may
worship
ashtaroth
if
it
please
you
in
your
own
hearts
and
god
looks
to
the
heart
and
not
to
the
outer
man
there
is
a
church
with
bishops
like
your
own
and
ministers
there
are
the
old
churches
to
worship
in
nay
you
may
find
the
old
ornaments
still
in
use
we
have
sacraments
as
you
have
you
may
seek
shrift
if
you
will
nay
in
some
manner
we
have
the
mass
though
we
do
not
call
it
so
but
we
follow
christ
ordinance
in
the
matter
and
you
can
do
no
more
we
have
the
word
of
god
as
you
have
and
we
use
the
same
creeds
what
more
can
the
rankest
papist
ask
tell
me
that
norris
for
i
am
of
your
folk
the
queen
turned
and
faced
him
again
a
moment
and
her
eyes
were
peevish
and
resentful
presently
she
went
on
again
campion
told
me
it
was
the
oath
that
troubled
him
he
could
not
take
it
he
said
i
told
the
fool
that
i
was
not
head
of
the
church
as
christ
was
but
only
the
supreme
governor
as
the
act
declares
in
all
spiritual
and
ecclesiastical
things
i
forget
how
it
runs
but
i
showed
it
him
and
asked
him
whether
it
were
not
true
and
i
asked
him
too
how
it
was
that
margaret
roper
could
take
the
oath
and
so
many
thousands
of
persons
as
full
christian
as
himself
and
he
could
not
answer
me
the
queen
was
silent
again
then
once
more
she
went
on
indignantly
it
is
yourselves
that
have
brought
all
this
trouble
on
your
heads
see
what
the
papists
have
done
against
me
they
have
excommunicated
me
deposed
me
though
in
spite
of
it
i
still
sit
on
the
throne
they
have
sent
an
armada
against
me
they
have
plotted
against
me
i
know
not
how
many
times
and
then
when
i
defend
myself
and
hang
a
few
of
the
wolves
lo
they
are
christ
flock
at
once
for
whom
he
shed
his
precious
blood
and
his
persecuted
lambs
and
i
am
jezebel
straightway
and
athaliah
and
beelzebub
wife
and
i
know
not
what
the
queen
stopped
out
of
breath
and
looked
fiercely
at
anthony
who
said
nothing
tell
me
how
you
answer
that
mr
norris
said
the
queen
i
dare
not
deal
with
such
great
matters
said
anthony
for
your
grace
knows
well
that
i
am
but
a
poor
priest
that
knows
nought
of
but
i
would
like
to
ask
your
highness
two
questions
only
the
first
is
whether
your
grace
had
aught
to
complain
of
in
the
conduct
of
your
catholic
subjects
when
the
armada
was
here
and
the
second
whether
there
hath
been
one
actual
attempt
upon
your
grace
life
by
private
persons
that
is
not
to
the
purpose
said
the
queen
peevishly
it
was
catholics
who
fought
against
me
in
the
armada
and
it
was
catholics
who
plotted
against
me
at
court
then
there
is
a
difference
in
catholics
your
grace
said
anthony
ah
i
see
what
you
would
be
at
yes
your
highness
i
would
rather
say
although
they
be
catholics
they
do
these
things
there
was
silence
again
which
anthony
did
not
dare
to
break
and
the
two
walked
up
the
whole
length
of
the
gallery
without
speaking
well
well
said
elizabeth
at
last
but
this
was
not
why
i
sent
for
you
we
will
speak
of
yourself
now
norris
i
hope
you
are
not
an
obstinate
fellow
eh
anthony
said
nothing
and
the
queen
went
on
now
as
i
have
told
you
i
judge
no
man
private
opinions
you
may
believe
what
you
will
remember
that
you
may
believe
what
you
will
nay
you
may
practise
your
religion
so
long
as
it
is
private
and
unknown
to
me
anthony
began
to
wonder
what
was
coming
but
he
still
said
nothing
as
the
queen
paused
she
stood
a
moment
looking
down
into
the
empty
again
and
then
turned
and
sat
suddenly
in
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
window
and
put
up
a
jewelled
hand
to
shield
her
face
with
her
elbow
on
the
arm
while
anthony
stood
before
her
i
remember
you
norris
very
well
at
greenwich
you
spoke
up
sharply
enough
and
you
looked
me
in
the
eyes
now
and
then
as
i
like
a
man
to
do
and
then
minnie
loved
you
too
i
wish
to
show
you
kindness
for
her
sake
anthony
heart
began
to
fail
him
for
he
guessed
now
what
was
coming
and
the
bitter
struggle
that
lay
before
him
now
i
know
well
that
the
commissioners
have
had
you
before
them
they
are
tiresome
busybodies
walsingham
started
all
that
and
set
them
and
of
my
person
and
the
rest
of
it
but
they
are
loyal
folk
and
i
suppose
they
asked
you
where
you
had
been
and
with
whom
you
had
stayed
and
so
on
they
did
your
grace
and
you
would
not
tell
them
i
suppose
i
could
not
madam
it
would
have
been
against
justice
and
charity
to
do
so
well
well
there
is
no
need
now
for
i
mean
to
take
you
out
of
their
hands
a
great
leap
of
hope
made
itself
felt
in
anthony
heart
he
did
not
know
how
heavy
the
apprehension
lay
on
him
till
this
light
shone
through
they
will
be
wrath
with
me
i
know
and
will
tell
me
that
they
can
not
defend
me
if
i
will
not
help
them
but
when
all
is
said
i
am
queen
now
i
do
not
ask
you
to
be
a
minister
of
my
church
for
that
i
think
you
would
never
be
but
i
think
you
would
like
to
be
near
me
is
it
not
so
and
i
wish
you
to
have
some
post
about
the
court
i
must
see
what
it
is
to
be
anthony
heart
began
to
sink
again
as
he
watched
the
queen
face
as
she
sat
tapping
a
foot
softly
and
looking
on
the
floor
as
she
talked
those
lines
of
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
surely
meant
something
then
she
looked
up
still
with
her
cheek
on
her
right
hand
you
do
not
thank
me
mr
norris
anthony
made
a
great
effort
but
he
heard
his
own
voice
quiver
a
little
i
thank
your
grace
for
your
kindly
intentions
toward
me
with
all
my
heart
the
queen
seemed
satisfied
and
looked
down
again
as
to
the
oath
i
will
not
ask
you
to
take
it
formally
if
you
will
give
me
an
assurance
of
your
loyalty
that
your
grace
i
give
most
gladly
his
heart
was
beating
again
in
great
irregular
thumps
in
his
throat
he
had
the
sensation
of
swaying
to
and
fro
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
now
towards
safety
and
now
towards
death
it
was
the
cruellest
pain
he
had
suffered
yet
but
how
was
it
possible
to
have
some
post
at
court
without
relinquishing
the
exercise
of
his
priesthood
he
must
think
it
out
what
did
the
queen
mean
and
of
course
you
will
not
be
able
to
say
mass
again
but
i
shall
not
hinder
your
hearing
it
at
the
ambassador
whenever
you
please
ah
it
had
come
his
heart
gave
a
leap
and
seemed
to
cease
your
grace
must
forgive
me
but
i
can
not
consent
there
was
a
dead
silence
when
anthony
looked
up
she
was
staring
at
him
with
the
frankest
astonishment
did
you
think
norris
you
could
be
at
court
and
say
mass
too
whenever
you
wished
her
voice
rang
harsh
and
shrill
her
anger
was
rising
i
was
not
sure
what
your
grace
intended
for
me
the
fellow
is
mad
she
said
still
staring
at
him
oh
take
care
take
care
your
grace
knows
i
intend
no
insolence
you
mean
to
say
norris
that
you
will
not
take
a
pardon
and
a
post
at
court
on
those
terms
anthony
bowed
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
so
bitter
was
the
reaction
but
see
man
you
fool
if
you
die
as
a
traitor
you
will
never
say
mass
again
either
but
that
will
not
be
with
my
consent
your
grace
and
you
refuse
the
pardon
on
those
terms
your
grace
i
must
well
and
she
was
silent
a
moment
you
are
a
fool
sir
anthony
bowed
again
but
i
like
well
then
you
will
not
be
my
servant
i
have
ever
been
that
your
grace
and
ever
will
be
well
well
but
not
at
court
ah
your
grace
knows
i
can
not
cried
anthony
and
his
voice
rang
sorrowfully
again
there
was
silence
you
must
have
your
way
sir
for
poor
minnie
sake
but
it
passes
my
understanding
what
you
mean
by
it
and
let
me
tell
you
that
not
many
have
their
way
with
me
rather
than
mine
again
hope
leapt
up
in
his
heart
the
queen
then
was
not
so
ungracious
he
looked
up
and
smiled
and
down
again
why
the
man
lips
are
all
what
ails
him
it
is
your
grace
kindness
i
must
say
i
marvel
at
it
myself
observed
elizabeth
you
near
angered
me
just
now
take
care
you
do
not
so
quite
i
would
not
willingly
as
your
grace
knows
then
we
will
end
this
matter
you
give
me
your
assurance
of
loyalty
to
my
person
with
all
my
heart
madam
said
anthony
eagerly
then
you
must
get
to
france
within
the
week
the
other
too
buxton
he
loses
his
estate
but
has
his
life
i
am
doing
much
for
minnie
sake
how
can
i
thank
your
grace
and
i
will
cause
sir
richard
to
give
it
out
that
you
have
taken
the
oath
call
him
in
there
was
a
quick
gasp
from
the
priest
and
then
he
cried
with
agony
in
his
voice
i
can
not
your
grace
i
can
not
can
not
call
sir
richard
why
you
are
mad
sir
can
not
consent
i
have
taken
no
oath
i
know
you
have
not
i
do
not
ask
it
elizabeth
voice
came
short
and
harsh
her
patience
was
vanishing
and
anthony
knew
it
and
looked
at
her
she
had
dropped
her
hand
and
it
was
clenching
and
unclenching
on
her
knee
her
stick
slipped
on
the
polished
boards
and
fell
but
she
paid
it
no
attention
she
was
looking
straight
at
the
priest
her
high
eyebrows
were
coming
down
her
mouth
was
beginning
to
mumble
a
little
he
could
see
in
the
clear
sunlight
that
fell
on
her
sideways
through
the
tall
window
a
thousand
little
wrinkles
and
all
seemed
alive
the
lines
at
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
deepened
as
he
watched
what
name
do
you
want
sir
it
was
like
the
first
mutter
of
a
storm
on
the
horizon
but
anthony
knew
it
must
break
he
did
not
answer
tell
me
sir
what
is
it
now
anthony
drew
a
long
breath
and
braced
his
will
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
knew
he
was
pronouncing
his
own
sentence
i
can
not
consent
to
leave
the
country
and
let
it
be
given
out
that
i
had
taken
the
oath
your
grace
it
would
be
an
apostasy
from
my
faith
elizabeth
sprang
to
her
feet
without
her
stick
took
one
step
forward
and
gave
anthony
a
fierce
blow
on
the
cheek
with
her
ringed
hand
he
recoiled
a
step
at
the
shock
of
it
and
stood
waiting
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
then
the
queen
anger
poured
out
in
words
her
eyes
burned
with
passion
out
of
an
face
and
her
voice
rang
high
and
harsh
and
her
hands
continually
clenched
and
unclenched
as
she
screamed
at
him

the
ungratefullest

with

chapter
xv
the
rolling
of
the
stone
it
was
a
week
later
and
a
little
before
dawn
that
isabel
was
kneeling
by
anthony
bed
in
his
room
in
the
tower
the
lieutenant
had
sent
for
her
to
his
lodging
the
evening
before
and
she
had
spent
the
whole
night
with
her
brother
he
had
been
racked
four
times
in
one
week
and
was
dying
the
city
and
the
prison
were
very
quiet
now
the
carts
had
not
yet
begun
to
roll
over
the
and
the
last
had
gone
home
he
lay
on
the
mattress
that
she
had
sent
in
to
him
in
the
corner
of
his
cell
under
the
window
on
his
back
and
very
still
covered
from
chin
to
feet
with
her
own
cloak
that
she
had
thrown
over
him
his
head
was
on
a
low
pillow
for
he
could
not
bear
to
lie
high
his
feet
made
a
little
mound
under
the
coverlet
and
his
arms
lay
straight
at
his
side
but
all
that
could
be
seen
of
him
was
his
face
pinched
and
white
now
with
hollows
in
his
cheeks
and
dark
patches
and
lines
beneath
his
closed
eyes
and
his
soft
pointed
brown
beard
that
just
rested
on
the
fur
edging
of
isabel
cloak
his
lips
were
drawn
tight
but
slightly
parted
showing
the
rim
of
his
white
teeth
as
if
he
snarled
with
pain
the
only
furniture
in
the
room
was
a
single
table
and
chair
the
table
was
drawn
up
not
far
from
the
bed
and
a
book
or
two
with
a
flask
of
cordial
and
some
fragments
of
food
on
a
plate
lay
upon
it
his
cloak
and
doublet
and
ruff
lay
across
the
chair
and
his
shoes
below
it
and
a
little
linen
lay
in
a
pile
in
another
corner
but
the
clothes
in
which
he
had
been
tortured
the
evening
before
his
shirt
and
hose
could
not
be
taken
off
him
and
he
lay
in
them
still
they
had
been
so
soaked
with
sweat
that
isabel
had
found
him
shivering
and
laid
her
cloak
over
him
and
now
he
lay
quiet
and
warm
earlier
in
the
night
she
had
been
reading
to
him
and
a
taper
still
burned
in
a
candlestick
on
the
table
but
for
the
last
two
hours
he
had
lain
either
in
a
sleep
or
a
swoon
and
she
had
laid
the
book
down
and
was
watching
him
he
was
so
motionless
that
he
would
have
seemed
dead
except
for
the
steady
rise
and
fall
of
a
fold
in
the
mantle
and
for
a
sudden
muscular
twitch
every
few
minutes
isabel
herself
was
scarcely
less
motionless
her
face
was
clear
and
pale
as
it
always
was
but
perfectly
serene
and
even
her
lips
did
not
quiver
she
was
kneeling
and
leaning
back
now
and
her
hands
were
clasped
in
her
lap
there
was
a
proud
content
in
her
face
her
dear
brother
had
not
uttered
one
name
on
the
rack
except
those
of
the
saviour
and
of
the
blessed
mother
so
the
lieutenant
had
told
her
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
and
there
was
nothing
but
peace
in
them
and
his
lips
moved
isabel
leaned
forward
on
her
hands
and
bent
her
ear
to
his
mouth
till
his
breath
was
warm
on
it
and
she
could
hear
the
whisper
then
she
opened
the
book
that
lay
face
down
on
the
table
and
began
to
read
on
from
the
point
at
which
she
had
laid
it
down
two
hours
before
autem
hora
tertia
et
crucifixerunt
and
it
was
the
third
hour
and
they
crucified
him
and
with
him
they
crucify
two
thieves
the
one
on
his
right
hand
and
the
other
on
his
left
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
which
saith
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
her
voice
was
slow
and
steady
as
she
read
the
unfamiliar
latin
still
kneeling
with
the
book
a
little
raised
to
catch
the
candlelight
and
her
grave
tranquil
eyes
bent
upon
it
only
once
did
her
voice
falter
and
then
she
commanded
it
again
immediately
and
that
as
she
read
autem
et
mulieres
de
longe
there
were
also
women
looking
on
afar
off
and
so
the
tale
crept
on
minute
by
minute
and
the
priest
lay
with
closed
eyes
to
hear
it
until
the
mocking
was
complete
and
the
darkness
of
the
sixth
hour
had
come
and
gone
and
the
saviour
had
cried
aloud
on
his
father
and
given
up
the
ghost
and
the
centurion
that
stood
by
had
borne
witness
and
the
great
criminal
slept
in
the
garden
in
the
sepulchre
wherein
was
never
man
yet
laid
there
was
a
listening
silence
as
the
voice
ceased
without
another
falter
isabel
laid
the
book
down
and
looked
at
him
again
and
his
eyes
opened
languidly
he
had
not
yet
said
more
than
single
words
and
even
now
his
voice
was
so
faint
that
she
had
to
put
her
ear
close
to
his
mouth
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
soul
had
gone
into
some
inner
secret
chamber
of
profound
peace
so
deep
that
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
task
to
send
a
thought
to
the
surface
through
his
lips
she
could
just
hear
him
and
she
answered
clearly
and
slowly
as
to
a
dazed
child
pausing
between
every
word
i
can
not
get
a
priest
it
is
not
allowed
still
his
eyes
bent
on
her
what
was
it
he
said
what
was
it
then
she
heard
and
began
to
repeat
short
acts
of
contrition
clearly
and
distinctly
pausing
between
the
phrases
in
english
and
his
eyes
closed
as
she
began
o
my
jesus
i
am
heartily
sorry
that
i
have
crucified
thee
by
my
sins
wash
my
soul
in
thy
precious
blood
o
my
god
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
displeased
thee
because
thou
art
i
hate
all
the
sins
that
i
have
done
against
thy
divine
majesty
and
so
phrase
after
phrase
she
went
on
giving
him
time
to
hear
and
to
make
an
inner
assent
of
the
will
and
repeating
also
other
short
vocal
prayers
that
she
knew
by
heart
and
so
the
delicate
skein
of
prayer
rose
from
the
altar
where
this
morning
sacrifice
lay
before
god
waiting
the
consummation
of
his
acceptance
presently
she
ended
and
he
lay
again
with
closed
eyes
and
mute
face
then
again
they
opened
and
she
bent
down
to
listen
it
will
all
be
well
with
me
she
answered
raising
her
head
again
mistress
margaret
has
written
from
brussels
i
shall
go
there
for
a
while
yes
buxton
will
take
me
next
week
he
goes
to
normandy
to
his
estate
again
his
lips
moved
and
she
listened
a
faint
flush
came
over
her
face
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
i
think
not
i
hope
to
enter
religion
no
i
have
not
yet
determined
the
dower
house
yes
i
will
sell
it
yes
to
hubert
if
he
wishes
it
every
word
he
whispered
was
such
an
effort
that
she
had
to
pause
again
and
again
before
he
could
make
her
understand
and
often
she
judged
more
by
the
movement
of
his
lips
than
by
any
sound
that
came
from
him
now
and
then
too
she
lifted
her
handkerchief
soaked
in
a
strong
violet
scent
and
passed
it
over
his
forehead
and
lips
she
motioned
with
the
flask
of
cordial
once
or
twice
but
his
eyes
closed
for
a
negative
as
she
knelt
and
watched
him
her
thoughts
circled
continually
in
little
flights
to
the
walled
garden
of
the
dower
house
in
sunshine
and
anthony
running
across
it
in
his
brown
suit
with
the
wallflowers
behind
him
against
the
old
red
bricks
and
ivy
and
the
tall
chestnut
rising
behind
to
the
hills
with
the
thistles
and
the
and
the
hazel
thickets
and
anthony
on
his
pony
sunburnt
and
voluble
hawk
on
wrist
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
to
the
warm
panelled
hall
in
winter
with
the
tapers
on
the
round
table
and
anthony
flat
on
his
face
with
his
feet
in
the
air
before
the
hearth
that
glowed
and
roared
up
the
wide
chimney
behind
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
a
book
open
before
him
or
farther
back
even
still
to
anthony
little
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
his
clothes
on
a
chair
and
the
boy
himself
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
arms
round
his
knees
as
she
came
in
to
wish
him
and
talk
to
him
a
minute
or
two
and
every
time
the
circling
thought
came
home
and
settled
again
on
the
sight
of
that
still
straight
figure
lying
on
the
mattress
against
the
discoloured
bricks
with
the
light
of
the
taper
glimmering
on
his
thin
face
and
brown
hair
and
beard
and
every
time
her
heart
consented
that
this
was
the
best
of
all
a
bird
chirped
suddenly
from
some
hole
in
the
tower
once
and
then
three
or
four
times
she
glanced
up
at
the
window
and
the
light
of
dawn
was
beginning
then
as
the
minutes
went
by
the
city
began
to
stir
itself
from
sleep
there
came
a
hollow
whine
from
the
fifty
yards
away
up
from
the
river
came
the
shout
of
a
waterman
two
or
three
times
a
late
cock
crew
and
still
the
light
crept
on
and
broadened
but
anthony
still
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
at
last
over
the
cobbles
outside
a
cart
rattled
turned
a
corner
and
was
silent
anthony
had
opened
his
eyes
now
and
was
looking
at
her
again
and
again
she
bent
down
to
listen
and
then
opened
and
read
again
cum
transisset
sabbatum
maria
magdalene
et
maria
jacobi
et
salome
emerunt
aromata
ut
venientes
ungerent
when
the
sabbath
was
past
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
salome
had
bought
sweet
spices
that
they
might
come
and
anoint
him
a
slight
sound
made
her
look
up
anthony
eyes
were
kindling
and
his
lips
moved
she
bent
again
and
listened
what
was
it
he
said
yes
it
was
so
and
she
smiled
and
nodded
at
him
she
was
reading
the
gospel
for
easter
day
the
gospel
of
the
first
mass
that
they
had
heard
together
on
that
spring
morning
at
great
keynes
when
their
lord
had
led
them
so
far
round
by
separate
paths
to
meet
one
another
at
his
altar
and
now
they
were
met
again
here
she
read
on
valde
mane
una
sabbatorum
veniunt
ad
monumentum
orto
jam
early
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
they
said
among
themselves
who
shall
roll
us
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
when
they
looked
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
for
it
was
very
read
isabel
and
looked
up
again
and
then
closed
the
book
there
was
no
need
to
read
more
she
walked
across
the
court
half
an
hour
later
just
as
the
sun
came
up
and
passed
out
through
the
lieutenant
lodging
and
out
by
the
narrow
bridge
on
to
the
tower
wharf
to
the
left
and
behind
her
as
she
looked
eastwards
down
the
river
lay
the
heavy
masses
of
the
prison
she
had
left
and
the
high
walls
and
turrets
were
gilded
with
glory
the
broad
river
itself
was
one
rolling
glory
too
the
tide
was
coming
in
swift
and
strong
and
a
barge
or
two
moved
upwards
only
half
seen
in
the
bewildering
path
of
the
sun
the
air
was
cool
and
keen
and
a
breeze
from
the
water
stirred
isabel
hair
as
she
stood
looking
with
the
light
on
her
face
it
was
a
cloudless
october
morning
overhead
even
as
she
stood
a
flock
of
pigeons
streamed
across
from
the
south
side
and
bathed
in
light
and
her
eyes
followed
them
a
moment
or
two
as
she
stood
there
silent
a
step
came
up
the
wharf
from
the
direction
of
katharine
street
and
a
man
came
walking
quickly
towards
her
he
did
not
see
who
she
was
until
he
was
close
and
then
he
started
and
took
off
his
hat
it
was
lackington
on
his
way
to
some
business
at
the
tower
but
she
did
not
seem
to
see
him
she
turned
almost
immediately
and
began
to
walk
westwards
and
the
glory
in
her
eyes
was
supreme
and
as
she
went
the
day
deepened
above
her
