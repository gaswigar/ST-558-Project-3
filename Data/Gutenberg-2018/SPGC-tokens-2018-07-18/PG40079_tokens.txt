the
philosophy
of

chapter
i
the
genesis
of
disenchantment
the
trite
and
commonplace
question
of
contentment
and
dissatisfaction
is
a
topic
which
is
not
only
of
interest
but
one
which
in
recent
years
has
so
claimed
the
attention
of
thinkers
that
they
have
broadly
divided
mankind
into
those
who
accept
life
as
a
more
or
less
pleasing
possession
and
those
who
resolutely
look
the
gift
in
the
mouth
and
say
it
is
not
worth
the
having
viewed
simply
as
systems
of
thought
the
first
of
these
two
divisions
is
evidently
contemporaneous
with
humanity
while
the
second
will
be
found
to
be
of
purely
modern
origin
for
from
the
earliest
times
man
admittedly
and
with
but
few
exceptions
has
been
ever
accustomed
to
regard
this
world
as
the
best
one
possible
and
through
nearly
every
creed
and
sect
he
has
considered
happiness
somewhat
in
the
light
of
an
inviolable
birthright
within
the
last
half
century
however
there
has
come
into
being
a
new
school
which
in
denying
the
possibility
of
any
happiness
holds
as
first
principle
that
the
world
is
a
theatre
of
misery
in
which
were
the
choice
accorded
it
would
be
preferable
not
to
be
born
at
all
in
stating
that
this
view
of
life
is
of
distinctly
modern
origin
it
should
be
understood
that
it
is
so
only
in
the
systematic
form
which
it
has
recently
assumed
for
individual
expressions
of
discontent
have
been
handed
down
from
remote
ages
and
any
one
who
cared
to
rummage
through
the
of
literature
would
find
material
enough
to
compile
a
dictionary
of
pessimistic
quotation
for
these
pages
but
little
rummaging
will
be
attempted
but
as
the
proper
presentation
of
the
subject
demands
a
brief
account
of
the
ideas
and
opinions
in
which
it
was
cradled
a
momentary
examination
of
general
literature
will
not
it
is
believed
cause
any
of
time
misspent
to
begin
then
with
greece
whose
literature
has
precedence
over
all
others
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
former
days
when
the
citizen
expended
the
greater
part
of
his
activity
for
the
common
good
the
poets
in
like
manner
sang
of
national
topics
the
gods
the
heroes
and
the
charms
of
love
there
was
therefore
little
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
purely
personal
ideas
and
the
whole
background
of
the
poetry
of
antiquity
is
in
consequence
brilliant
with
optimistic
effect
nevertheless
here
and
there
a
few
complaints
crop
out
from
time
to
time
homer
for
instance
says
that
man
is
the
unhappiest
wight
that
ever
breathed
or
strutted
and
describes
his
ephemeral
existence
in
a
wail
of
gloomy
hexameters
then
too
there
is
the
touching
orphean
distich
which
runs
from
thy
smile
o
jove
sprang
the
gods
but
man
was
born
of
thy
sorrow
pindar
in
one
of
his
graceful
odes
compared
men
to
the
shadows
of
a
dream
while
the
familiar
quotation
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
comes
to
us
straight
from
menander
with
the
peculiar
melancholy
of
genius
that
in
those
favored
days
seems
more
a
presentiment
than
the
expression
of
a
general
conception
sophocles
in
his
last
tragedy
says
that
not
to
be
born
at
all
is
the
greatest
of
all
possible
benefits
but
inasmuch
as
man
has
appeared
on
earth
the
very
best
thing
he
can
do
is
to
hurry
back
where
he
came
from
in
spite
too
of
the
general
tendency
of
thought
sentiments
not
dissimilar
are
to
be
found
in
æschylus
and
euripides
while
something
of
this
instinctive
pessimism
was
expanded
into
a
quaint
and
national
custom
by
the
thracians
who
according
to
herodotus
met
birth
with
lamentations
but
greeted
death
with
salvos
and
welcoming
festivals
with
but
few
exceptions
the
early
philosophers
considered
death
not
as
a
misfortune
but
as
an
advantage
empedocles
taught
that
the
sojourn
on
earth
was
one
of
vexatious
torment
an
opinion
in
which
he
was
firmly
supported
by
heraclitus
and
even
plato
whose
general
drift
of
thought
was
grandly
optimistic
said
in
the
apology
if
death
is
the
withdrawal
of
every
sensation
if
it
is
like
a
sleep
which
no
dream
disturbs
what
an
incomparable
blessing
it
must
be
for
let
any
one
select
a
night
passed
in
undisturbed
and
entire
rest
and
compare
it
with
the
other
nights
and
days
that
have
filled
his
existence
and
then
from
his
conscience
let
him
answer
how
many
nights
and
days
he
has
known
which
have
been
sweeter
and
more
agreeable
than
that
for
my
part
i
am
sure
that
not
the
ordinary
individual
alone
but
even
the
great
king
of
persia
would
find
such
days
and
nights
most
easy
to
enumerate
the
doctrine
of
epicurus
held
in
substance
that
the
moment
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
delight
the
senses
death
became
a
benefit
and
suicide
a
crowning
act
of
wisdom
the
teaching
of
the
socratic
school
and
its
offshoots
amounted
in
brief
to
the
idea
that
the
only
admissible
aim
of
life
was
the
pursuit
and
attainment
of
absolute
knowledge
absolute
knowledge
however
being
found
unattainable
the
logical
culmination
of
their
doctrine
was
delivered
by
hegesias
in
alexandria
in
the
third
century
before
the
christian
era
this
disciple
of
socrates
argued
that
as
there
was
a
limit
to
the
knowable
and
happiness
was
a
pure
illusion
a
further
prolongation
of
existence
was
useless
life
seems
pleasing
only
to
the
fool
he
stated
the
wise
regard
it
with
indifference
and
consider
death
just
as
acceptable
death
he
added
is
as
good
as
life
it
is
but
a
supreme
renunciation
in
which
man
is
freed
from
idle
complaints
and
long
deceptions
life
is
full
of
pain
and
the
pangs
of
the
flesh
gnaw
at
the
mind
and
rout
its
calm
in
countless
ways
fate
intercepts
and
thwarts
our
hopes
contentment
is
not
to
be
relied
on
and
even
wisdom
can
not
preserve
us
from
the
treachery
and
insecurity
of
the
perceptions
since
happiness
then
is
intangible
we
should
cease
to
pursue
it
and
take
for
our
goal
the
absence
of
pain
this
condition
he
explained
is
best
obtained
in
making
ourselves
indifferent
to
every
object
of
desire
and
every
cause
of
dislike
and
above
all
to
life
itself
in
any
event
he
concluded
death
is
advantageous
in
this
it
takes
us
not
from
blessings
but
from
evil
this
curious
mixture
of
pessimism
and
theology
was
it
is
said
delivered
with
such
charm
of
persuasive
grace
and
eloquence
that
several
of
his
listeners
put
his
ideas
into
instant
practice
and
that
the
city
might
be
preserved
from
the
contagion
of
suicide
king
ptolemy
felt
himself
obliged
to
prevent
this
seductive
misanthrope
from
delivering
any
further
harangues
literature
has
the
same
tendency
to
repeat
itself
as
history
and
as
the
romans
took
much
of
their
culture
and
many
of
their
ideas
from
greece
the
tone
of
their
principal
writers
is
only
dissimilar
to
those
already
quoted
in
that
with
the
fall
of
their
religion
the
decline
of
the
empire
and
the
universal
intoxication
of
the
senses
the
pessimist
element
became
somewhat
accentuated
it
would
be
an
idle
task
however
to
attempt
to
cite
even
a
fraction
of
the
cheerless
distress
which
pervades
the
roman
classics
and
it
will
perhaps
suffice
for
the
moment
to
note
but
a
passage
or
two
which
bear
directly
upon
the
subject
seneca
for
instance
whose
insight
was
as
clear
and
whose
understanding
was
as
unclouded
as
any
writer
with
whom
the
world
is
acquainted
sent
his
letters
down
the
centuries
freighted
with
such
ideas
as
these
death
is
nature
most
admirable
invention
there
is
no
need
to
complain
of
particular
grievances
for
life
in
its
entirety
is
lamentable
no
one
would
accept
life
were
it
not
received
in
ignorance
of
what
it
is
pliny
also
is
very
quotable
nature
most
pleasing
invention
he
says
is
brevity
of
life
and
he
adds
no
mortal
is
happy
for
even
if
there
is
no
other
cause
for
discontent
there
is
at
least
the
fear
of
possible
misfortune
then
too
petronius
the
poet
of
the
roman
orgy
opening
and
closing
his
veins
toying
with
death
as
with
a
last
and
supreme
delight
is
of
familiar
if
repulsive
memory
english
literature
is
naturally
as
well
stocked
with
individual
expressions
of
distaste
for
existence
as
that
of
rome
the
poets
nearly
one
and
all
from
chaucer
to
rossetti
have
told
their
sorrow
in
a
variety
of
more
or
less
polished
metre
and
even
macpherson
was
careful
in
dowering
his
century
with
another
bard
to
put
thoughts
into
ossian
verse
which
would
not
have
been
unfitting
in
a
greek
chorus
in
speaking
of
the
world
chaucer
had
already
said
here
is
no
home
here
is
but
a
wilderness
when
sir
thomas
wyatt
enlarging
on
the
theme
repeated
wherefore

none
of

to
be
reminded
that
poe
soul
was
but
the
poets
are
not
alone
in
their
tale
of
the
deceptions
of
life
the
moralists
and
essayists
too
have
added
their
quota
to
the
general
budget
and
it
is
not
simply
the
value
of
life
that
has
been
questioned
by
many
of
the
best
writers
there
has
been
also
a
certain
surprise
expressed
that
man
should
care
to
live
at
all
indeed
the
i
see
no
necessity
of
the
wit
to
the
beggar
imploring
aid
that
he
might
live
is
the
epigram
of
the
thoughts
of
a
hundred
scholars
in
france
pessimism
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
ever
regarded
otherwise
than
as
an
intellectual
curiosity
the
frenchman
it
is
true
not
infrequently
lapses
into
a
cynical
indifference
yet
the
value
of
life
is
as
a
rule
so
evident
to
him
that
he
seldom
vouchsafes
more
than
a
passing
shrug
to
any
theory
of
disparagement
in
the
first
place
death
to
which
the
hat
is
gravely
raised
has
never
been
in
france
a
polite
or
welcome
topic
moreover
french
literature
while
lawless
enough
in
other
respects
has
left
its
readers
generally
unprepared
to
view
the
world
as
a
fiasco
in
which
misery
is
the
one
immense
success
the
trouvères
and
troubadours
sang
to
the
mediæval
châtelaine
little
else
than
the
praise
of
love
with
here
and
there
the
account
of
some
combat
to
show
what
they
might
do
were
they
put
to
the
test
later
villon
told
gently
of
the
ronsard
aimed
a
dart
or
two
at
fate
and
rabelais
laugh
was
sometimes
very
near
to
tears
but
broadly
speaking
the
french
asked
of
their
writers
little
else
than
wit
if
they
could
not
give
them
that
then
should
they
hold
their
peace
the
delicate
irony
of
candide
had
therefore
when
appreciated
something
almost
novel
in
its
savor
and
indeed
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
it
was
not
until
the
blight
of
byron
had
been
cheerfully
translated
that
the
french
were
in
any
measure
prepared
to
understand
rolla
and
the
pathetic
beauties
of
de
musset
verse
pascal
helvetius
and
other
writers
of
desultory
depression
had
of
course
already
appeared
maupertuis
had
found
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
life
held
more
pain
than
pleasure
while
chamfort
conclusions
on
the
same
subject
were
as
luminous
as
they
were
gloomy
and
yet
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
the
gall
with
which
these
authors
dashed
their
pages
served
otherwise
than
as
a
condiment
to
fresher
and
less
flavored
works
baudelaire
the
poet
of
boredom
praying
for
a
new
vice
that
should
wrest
life
into
some
semblance
of
reality
was
in
consequence
almost
a
novelty
and
not
a
perfectly
satisfactory
one
at
that
it
is
therefore
only
within
the
last
ten
years
or
so
that
pessimism
has
in
any
wise
attracted
the
notice
of
french
thinkers
and
the
attention
which
has
recently
been
paid
to
it
is
due
partly
to
leconte
de
lisle
and
partly
to
a
surge
of
german
thought
during
the
eighteenth
century
the
majority
of
the
scholars
who
represented
the
culture
of
germany
were
faithfully
following
the
optimist
theories
of
leibnitz
and
wolf
the
doctrine
that
the
world
was
the
best
one
possible
supported
as
it
was
by
official
theology
and
strictly
in
accord
with
the
deism
of
pope
and
paley
was
very
generally
and
unhesitatingly
accepted
indeed
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
the
minnesingers
doubtless
had
formulated
some
few
complaints
but
then
these
literary
vagrants
had
already
begun
to
form
part
of
mythology
and
besides
poets
are
all
more
or
less
prone
to
discontent
and
voluble
of
sorrow
beyond
the
classics
of
greece
and
rome
there
was
therefore
no
precedent
for
pessimistic
thought
german
literature
strictly
speaking
did
not
begin
until
lessing
advent
and
before
that
the
theatre
with
its
hans
wurst
and
its
pickleherring
had
offered
only
a
succession
of
the
broadest
farce
the
calm
and
quiet
which
the
germans
then
enjoyed
was
ruffled
if
at
all
only
by
some
confused
echoes
of
the
which
voltaire
royal
disciple
was
pleased
to
disseminate
but
it
is
probable
that
the
better
part
of
this
ferocious
gayety
was
drowned
in
crossing
the
rhine
and
in
any
event
it
was
too
delicately
pungent
to
do
more
than
disturb
the
placid
current
of
their
thought
later
when
kant
appeared
the
effect
of
his
philosophy
was
very
much
like
a
successful
treatment
of
cataract
on
the
eyes
of
the
whole
nation
happiness
he
insisted
in
the
kritik
der
urtheilskraft
has
never
been
attained
by
man
for
he
is
unable
to
find
contentment
in
any
possession
or
enjoyment
and
were
he
called
upon
to
fashion
a
system
of
happiness
for
his
fellows
he
would
be
unable
to
do
so
for
happiness
is
in
its
essence
intangible
no
one
he
added
elsewhere
has
a
right
conception
of
life
who
would
care
to
prolong
it
beyond
its
natural
duration
for
it
would
then
be
only
the
continuation
of
an
already
tiresome
struggle
after
this
the
teaching
of
leibnitz
slowly
disappeared
and
though
a
certain
amount
of
optimism
necessarily
subsisted
the
tendency
of
thought
veered
to
the
opposite
direction
fichte
kant
immediate
successor
declared
in
direct
contradiction
to
leibnitz
that
this
world
was
the
worst
one
possible
and
was
only
consoled
by
thinking
he
could
raise
himself
by
the
aid
of
pure
thought
into
the
felicity
of
the
supersensible
men
he
says
in
the
vehement
pursuit
of
happiness
grasp
at
the
first
object
which
offers
to
them
any
prospect
of
satisfaction
but
immediately
they
turn
an
introspective
eye
and
ask
i
happy
and
at
once
from
their
innermost
being
a
voice
answers
distinctly
you
are
as
poor
and
as
miserable
as
before
then
they
think
it
was
the
object
that
deceived
them
and
turn
precipitately
to
another
but
the
second
holds
as
little
satisfaction
as
the
first
wandering
then
through
life
restless
and
tormented
at
each
successive
station
they
think
that
happiness
dwells
at
the
next
but
when
they
reach
it
happiness
is
no
longer
there
in
whatever
position
they
may
find
themselves
there
is
always
another
one
which
they
discern
from
afar
and
which
but
to
touch
they
think
is
to
find
the
wished
delight
but
when
the
goal
is
reached
discontent
has
followed
on
the
way
and
stands
in
haunting
constancy
before
them
schelling
expressed
himself
more
guardedly
as
professional
pantheist
he
seemed
to
think
that
anything
not
rigidly
vague
and
inaccessible
was
inconsistent
with
his
philosophy
still
there
was
probably
a
secret
revolt
some
propelling
impulse
to
deny
his
own
syllogisms
and
to
bathe
for
once
in
some
clear
stream
of
common
sense
in
the
nachtwachen
which
he
published
under
the
pseudonym
of
bonaventura
this
incentive
is
evidently
though
unsuccessfully
at
work
it
may
be
that
the
force
of
habit
was
too
strong
but
at
any
rate
this
rhapsody
which
was
intended
to
be
a
confession
of
the
combat
that
he
had
waged
with
his
belief
and
a
recognition
of
the
immedicable
misery
of
life
brings
with
it
something
of
that
impression
of
delirium
which
poe
and
doré
not
infrequently
suggest
nor
was
hegel
hostile
to
pessimism
he
regarded
it
as
an
inevitable
phase
of
universal
evolution
and
indeed
its
dawn
as
a
science
had
then
already
broken
meanwhile
the
poets
had
not
been
idle
herder
and
schiller
had
already
attested
the
bitterness
of
life
to
unreluctant
ears
and
the
number
of
suicides
that
were
directly
traceable
to
the
appearance
of
werther
and
his
sorrows
was
instructively
large
this
phase
of
sentimentalism
which
immediately
preceded
the
riotous
rebirth
of
the
romantic
school
was
not
without
its
influence
on
heine
verse
and
in
some
measure
affected
the
literary
tone
of
the
day
it
would
however
be
erroneous
to
suppose
that
the
poets
of
this
epoch
were
more
agitated
by
the
impression
of
universal
worthlessness
of
life
than
were
their
classic
predecessors
the
distress
of
werther
as
that
of
lara
and
of
rolla
was
not
the
pain
of
suffering
humanity
it
was
in
each
case
merely
the
poet
complacent
analysis
of
his
own
exceptional
nature
and
personal
grievances
it
was
the
expression
of
the
inevitable
surprise
of
youth
which
notes
for
the
first
time
reality
unsuspected
yet
yawning
indifference
to
the
ideal
and
the
stubborn
disaccord
between
aspiration
and
fact
it
was
indeed
very
beautiful
and
elegiac
and
yet
so
fluent
in
its
polished
melancholy
that
somehow
it
did
not
at
all
times
seem
to
have
been
really
felt
in
any
case
it
was
not
a
theory
of
common
woe
and
lacked
that
clear
conception
of
the
universality
of
suffering
which
the
less
exalted
minds
of
the
philosophers
had
already
signaled
but
for
which
no
one
as
yet
had
been
able
to
suggest
a
remedy
it
was
about
this
time
that
an
action
was
being
instituted
against
humanity
by
a
young
italian
the
count
giacomo
leopardi
and
the
muffled
discontent
which
for
centuries
had
been
throbbing
through
land
and
literature
was
raised
by
his
verse
into
one
clear
note
of
eloquent
arraignment
now
in
most
countries
there
is
a
provision
which
inhibits
a
judge
from
hearing
a
cause
which
is
pleaded
by
one
of
his
connections
for
it
is
considered
that
the
scales
of
justice
are
so
delicately
balanced
that
their
holder
should
be
preserved
from
any
biasing
influence
however
indirect
for
much
the
same
reason
there
are
few
communities
that
permit
a
man
to
sit
in
judgment
on
his
own
case
some
knowledge
of
leopardi
himself
therefore
will
be
of
service
in
deciding
whether
the
verdict
which
he
brought
against
the
world
should
be
accepted
without
appeal
or
returned
as
vitiated
by
extraneous
circumstances
leopardi
passed
a
joyless
boyhood
at
recanti
one
of
those
maddeningly
monotonous
italian
towns
whose
unspeakable
dreariness
is
only
attractive
when
viewed
through
the
pages
of
stendhal
the
unrelaxing
severity
of
an
austere
and
pedant
father
curbed
as
with
a
bit
every
symptom
of
that
haphazard
gayety
which
is
incident
to
youth
at
once
precocious
and
restive
deformed
yet
inflammable
he
was
necessarily
enervated
by
the
exasperating
dullness
of
his
life
and
chafed
too
by
the
rigid
poverty
to
which
his
father
condemned
him
as
he
grew
up
his
mind
richly
stored
with
the
wealth
of
antiquity
rioted
in
a
turbulency
of
imagination
which
unable
to
find
sympathetic
welcome
without
consumed
itself
in
morbid
distrust
within
and
led
him
at
last
from
fervid
catholicism
down
the
precipitate
steps
of
negation
he
was
not
much
over
twenty
before
excessive
study
had
ruined
such
health
as
he
once
possessed
the
slightest
application
was
wearisome
both
to
eye
and
brain
he
wandered
silently
about
the
neighboring
forests
seeking
solitude
not
only
for
the
sake
of
solitude
but
also
perhaps
for
the
suggestions
at
once
soothing
and
rebellious
which
solitude
always
whispers
to
him
who
courts
her
truly
at
other
times
he
sat
hour
by
hour
in
a
state
as
motionless
as
that
of
catalepsy
i
am
so
much
overcome
he
wrote
to
a
friend
by
the
nothingness
that
surrounds
me
that
i
do
not
know
how
i
have
the
strength
to
answer
your
letter
if
at
this
moment
i
lost
my
reason
i
think
that
my
insanity
would
consist
in
sitting
always
with
eyes
fixed
without
laughing
or
weeping
or
changing
place
i
have
no
longer
the
strength
to
form
a
desire
be
it
even
for
death
the
muse
however
would
have
none
of
this
she
flaunted
her
peplum
so
seductively
before
him
that
a
little
later
when
he
had
been
visited
by
some
semblance
of
returning
health
he
resisted
no
longer
and
delivered
himself
up
to
her
heart
and
soul
the
present
century
especially
during
its
earlier
decades
has
been
racked
with
a
great
glut
of
despondent
verse
but
no
batch
of
poets
however
distressed
has
been
able
at
any
time
to
catch
and
cling
to
such
a
persistent
monotone
of
complaint
as
that
which
runs
through
every
line
of
leopardi
verse
to
quote
de
musset
les
plus
désespérés
sont
les
chants
les
plus
beaux
et
sais
qui
sont
de
purs
sanglots
his
odes
his
adjurations
to
italy
and
his
elegies
are
one
and
all
stamped
with
such
unvarying
and
changeless
despair
that
their
dominant
motive
seems
not
unlike
that
tower
which
rené
finding
alone
in
the
desert
compared
to
a
great
thought
in
a
mind
ravaged
by
years
and
by
grief
his
theory
of
life
never
altered
he
resumed
it
in
a
distich
arcano
é
tutto
fuor
che
il
nostro
dolor
it
may
be
said
and
with
justice
perhaps
that
it
was
the
invalid
body
aggravating
and
coexisting
with
a
mind
naturally
morbid
that
afterwards
wrote
of
the
del
but
it
was
the
thinker
conquering
the
ills
of
the
flesh
who
later
whispered
to
the
suffering
world
the
panacea
of
patience
and
resignation
in
leopardi
there
is
none
of
the
vapid
elegance
and
gaudy
vocabulary
of
french
verse
technically
he
wrote
in
what
the
italians
call
and
he
charms
the
reader
as
well
through
a
palpitant
sincerity
as
evident
and
continuous
inspiration
now
the
educated
italian
turns
naturally
to
rhyme
any
incident
holds
to
him
the
germ
of
a
sonnet
and
there
is
perhaps
no
other
country
in
the
world
so
richly
dowered
with
patriotic
canzoni
as
this
joyously
unhappy
land
but
of
all
who
have
sounded
this
eloquent
chord
not
one
has
done
so
with
the
masculine
originality
and
fervor
of
expression
that
leopardi
reached
in
his
ode
to
italy
in
which
in
a
resounding
call
to
arms
he
exclaims
let
my
blood
o
gods
be
a
flame
to
italian
hearts
italian
hearts
however
had
other
matters
to
attend
to
and
magnificent
invocation
was
barely
honored
with
a
passing
notice
for
that
matter
his
poetry
in
spite
of
its
resonant
merit
has
through
some
inexplicable
cause
been
generally
ignored
and
while
it
resembles
no
other
it
has
never
so
to
speak
been
in
vogue
as
has
been
seen
he
was
a
lover
of
solitude
indeed
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
he
was
glued
to
it
and
in
the
isolation
which
he
partly
made
himself
and
which
was
partly
forced
upon
him
he
watched
the
incubation
of
thought
very
much
as
another
might
have
noted
the
progress
of
a
disease
a
life
of
this
description
even
at
best
is
hardly
calculated
to
awaken
much
enthusiasm
for
matters
and
it
was
not
long
before
leopardi
became
not
only
heartily
sick
of
the
commonplace
aspects
of
life
but
contemptuous
too
of
those
who
lived
in
broader
and
more
active
spheres
poetically
untrammeled
and
of
advanced
views
on
all
subjects
he
regarded
erudition
as
the
simple
novitiate
of
the
man
of
letters
or
in
other
words
as
a
preparation
which
renders
the
intelligence
supple
and
pliant
and
in
one
of
those
rare
moments
when
the
timid
approach
of
ambition
was
seemingly
unnoticed
he
caressed
the
pleasing
plan
of
attacking
italian
torpor
with
reason
passion
with
laughter
and
of
becoming
in
fact
the
plato
the
shakespeare
and
the
lucian
of
his
epoch
to
giordani
his
mentor
he
wrote
i
study
night
and
day
so
long
as
my
health
permits
when
it
prevents
me
from
working
i
wait
a
month
or
so
and
then
begin
again
as
i
am
now
totally
different
from
that
which
i
was
my
plan
of
study
has
altered
with
me
everything
which
savors
of
the
pathetic
or
the
eloquent
wearies
me
beyond
expression
i
seek
now
only
the
true
the
real
which
before
was
so
repulsive
i
take
pleasure
in
analyzing
the
misery
of
men
and
things
and
in
shivering
as
i
note
the
sinister
and
terrible
mystery
of
life
i
see
very
clearly
that
when
passion
is
once
extinguished
there
subsists
in
study
no
other
source
of
pleasure
save
that
of
vain
curiosity
whose
satisfaction
however
is
not
without
a
certain
charm
but
leopardi
was
so
essentially
the
poet
that
in
spite
of
his
growing
disdain
of
the
pathetic
and
the
eloquent
he
became
not
infrequently
the
dupe
of
his
own
imagination
that
which
he
took
for
the
fruit
of
deduction
was
probably
little
more
than
ordinary
hypochondria
and
in
turning
as
he
did
to
other
work
he
was
never
able
to
free
himself
entirely
from
the
jealous
influence
of
the
muse
he
was
from
a
variety
of
causes
very
miserable
himself
and
his
belief
in
universal
misery
amounted
very
nearly
to
a
mania
his
logic
reduced
itself
to
the
paraphrase
of
an
axiom
i
am
therefore
i
suffer
and
the
suffering
which
he
experienced
was
not
he
was
very
sure
limited
solely
to
himself
it
was
he
considered
the
garment
and
appanage
of
every
sentient
being
in
this
he
was
perfectly
correct
but
his
error
consisted
in
holding
all
cases
to
be
equally
intense
and
in
imagining
that
means
might
be
devised
which
would
at
once
do
away
with
or
at
least
lessen
the
evil
patience
and
resignation
he
had
already
suggested
but
naturally
without
appreciable
success
indeed
the
regeneration
of
man
he
clearly
saw
was
not
to
be
brought
about
through
verse
and
he
turned
therefore
to
philosophy
with
a
fixity
of
purpose
which
was
strengthened
by
the
idea
that
he
could
work
therein
another
revolution
this
was
in
leopardi
at
that
time
was
in
his
year
and
the
task
to
which
he
then
devoted
himself
was
he
said
to
be
the
sad
ending
of
a
miserable
life
his
intention
was
to
run
the
bitter
truth
to
earth
to
learn
the
obscure
destinies
of
the
mortal
and
the
eternal
to
discover
the
wherefore
of
creation
and
the
reason
of
man
burden
of
misery
i
wish
he
said
to
dig
to
the
root
of
nature
and
seek
the
aim
of
the
mysterious
universe
whose
praises
the
sages
sing
and
before
which
i
stand
aghast
forthwith
then
in
the
operette
morale
leopardi
began
a
resolute
if
poetic
siege
against
every
form
of
illusion
his
philosophy
however
provoked
no
revolution
nor
can
it
be
even
said
that
he
discovered
any
truth
more
bitter
than
the
old
new
ones
which
antiquity
had
unearthed
before
him
his
work
nevertheless
sent
the
old
facts
spinning
into
fresh
and
novel
positions
and
is
to
be
particularly
admired
for
the
artistic
manner
in
which
it
handles
the
most
stubborn
topics
the
starting
point
of
each
of
his
arguments
is
that
life
is
evil
to
any
objection
and
the
objections
that
have
been
made
are
countless
leopardi
has
one
invariable
reply
all
that
is
advanced
to
the
contrary
is
the
result
of
illusion
but
supposing
life
to
be
painless
some
one
presumably
may
interject
whereupon
leopardi
with
the
air
of
an
oracle
too
busy
with
weighty
matters
to
descend
to
on
the
weather
will
answer
tersely
evil
still
it
is
useless
for
the
practical
man
of
the
day
who
knows
the
price
of
wheat
the
whole
world
over
before
he
has
tasted
his
coffee
and
who
digests
a
history
of
the
world
doings
and
misdoings
each
morning
with
his
breakfast
it
is
useless
for
him
to
say
as
he
invariably
does
why
this
is
rubbish
look
at
modern
institutions
look
at
progress
look
at
science
for
if
he
listens
to
leopardi
he
will
learn
that
all
these
palpable
advantages
have
in
expanding
activity
only
aggravated
the
misery
of
man
in
other
words
that
the
sorrows
of
men
and
of
nations
develop
in
proportion
to
their
intelligence
and
the
most
civilized
are
in
consequence
the
most
unhappy
indeed
leopardi
philosophy
is
nothing
if
not
destructive
he
does
not
aim
so
much
to
edify
as
to
undermine
according
to
his
theory
the
universe
is
the
resultant
of
an
unconscious
force
and
this
force
he
teaches
is
shrouded
in
a
vexatious
mystery
behind
which
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
look
in
one
of
his
dialogues
certain
mummies
resurrect
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
tell
in
what
manner
they
died
and
what
follows
death
their
auditor
asks
eagerly
but
the
quarter
of
an
hour
has
expired
and
the
mummies
relapse
into
silence
in
another
fantastic
scene
an
icelander
convinced
that
happiness
is
unattainable
and
solely
occupied
in
avoiding
pain
has
in
shunning
society
found
himself
in
the
heart
of
the
sahara
face
to
face
with
nature
this
icelander
who
by
the
way
singularly
resembles
leopardi
had
found
but
one
protection
against
the
ills
of
life
and
that
was
solitude
but
wherever
he
wandered
he
had
been
pursued
by
a
certain
malevolence
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
he
had
roasted
in
summer
and
shivered
in
winter
in
vain
he
had
sought
a
temperate
climate
one
land
was
an
another
an
oven
and
everywhere
tempests
or
earthquakes
vicious
brutes
or
distracting
insects
in
short
unalloyed
misery
finding
himself
at
last
face
to
face
with
nature
he
took
her
to
task
demanding
what
right
she
had
to
create
him
without
his
permission
and
then
having
done
so
to
leave
him
to
his
own
devices
nature
answers
that
she
has
but
one
duty
and
that
is
to
turn
the
wheel
of
the
universe
in
which
death
supports
life
and
life
death
well
then
the
obstinate
icelander
asks
tell
me
at
least
for
whose
pleasure
and
for
what
purpose
this
miserable
universe
subsists
but
before
nature
can
enlighten
her
embarrassing
questioner
he
is
surprised
by
two
famished
lions
and
conveniently
devoured
the
moral
of
all
this
is
not
difficult
to
find
life
such
as
it
is
is
all
this
is
accorded
beyond
it
there
is
only
an
impenetrable
silence
the
blue
of
the
heavens
is
pervasive
but
void
the
hope
of
ultramundane
felicity
is
therefore
an
illusion
and
man
is
to
seek
such
happiness
as
is
possible
only
in
this
life
but
if
it
be
asked
what
the
possibilities
of
earthly
happiness
are
leopardi
is
quick
to
tell
his
reader
that
there
are
none
at
all
as
has
been
seen
he
regarded
life
as
an
evil
and
he
insisted
in
so
regarding
it
not
only
as
a
whole
but
in
each
of
its
fractional
divisions
this
idea
is
quaintly
expressed
in
a
dialogue
between
a
sorcerer
and
a
demon
the
latter
having
been
presumably
summoned
with
an
incantatory
blue
flame
the
demon
is
somewhat
sulky
at
first
and
asks
why
he
has
been
disturbed
is
it
wealth
that
the
sorcerer
wishes
is
it
glory
or
grandeur
but
the
sorcerer
has
neither
greed
nor
ambition
do
you
wish
me
to
procure
for
you
a
woman
as
captiously
capricious
as
penelope
the
sorcerer
probably
smiles
for
he
answers
wittily
do
you
think
i
need
the
aid
of
a
devil
for
that
thus
outfaced
the
demon
begs
to
know
in
what
manner
he
may
be
of
service
i
simply
want
one
moment
of
happiness
the
sorcerer
answers
but
mephisto
declares
on
his
word
as
a
gentleman
that
such
a
thing
is
impossible
because
the
desire
for
happiness
is
insatiable
and
no
one
can
be
happy
so
long
as
it
is
unsatisfied
well
then
the
sorcerer
asks
moodily
querulous
well
then
answers
the
demon
if
you
think
it
worth
while
to
give
me
your
soul
before
the
time
behold
me
ready
to
oblige
you
since
happiness
then
is
intangible
the
wisest
thing
to
do
is
to
try
to
be
as
little
unhappy
as
possible
one
of
the
chief
opponents
to
such
a
state
of
being
is
evidently
discontent
and
this
leopardi
hints
should
be
routed
at
any
cost
and
the
yawning
spectre
of
ennui
flung
with
it
into
fettered
exile
in
the
warmth
of
these
instructions
it
is
curious
to
note
how
leopardi
turns
on
himself
so
to
speak
and
recommends
as
the
very
activity
which
he
had
before
proscribed
in
his
dialogue
between
columbus
and
gutierrez
the
navigator
admits
to
his
discouraged
companion
that
the
success
of
the
undertaking
is
far
from
certain
but
he
adds
even
if
no
other
benefit
accrue
from
our
voyage
it
will
be
an
advantage
at
least
in
this
it
has
for
a
certain
time
delivered
us
from
boredom
it
has
made
us
love
life
and
appreciate
moreover
many
things
of
which
otherwise
we
would
have
thought
nothing
it
should
not
however
be
supposed
that
leopardi
had
no
higher
rule
of
life
than
that
which
is
circumscribed
in
the
narrow
avoidance
of
discontent
that
man
has
certain
duties
to
perform
he
frequently
admitted
but
he
denied
that
he
owed
any
to
the
unconscious
and
tyrannical
force
which
had
given
him
life
i
will
never
kiss
he
said
the
hand
that
strikes
any
obligation
to
society
was
equally
out
of
the
question
society
he
noted
in
the
is
a
league
of
blackguards
against
honest
men
man
duties
are
to
himself
alone
and
the
essence
of
leopardi
ethics
as
indeed
of
all
other
ethics
is
held
simply
in
the
recommendation
that
virtue
and
be
preserved
to
thine
own
self
be
true
polonius
had
said
long
before
and
to
this
leopardi
had
nothing
to
add
the
illusions
which
hamper
life
have
been
so
clearly
and
thoroughly
analyzed
by
other
thinkers
whose
conclusions
will
be
found
to
constitute
the
groundwork
of
the
subsequent
part
of
this
monograph
that
it
will
be
unnecessary
at
this
stage
to
examine
any
of
theories
on
this
subject
save
such
perhaps
as
may
seem
to
contain
original
views
he
had
as
has
been
intimated
a
thorough
contempt
for
life
it
is
he
said
fit
but
to
be
despised
vita
a
che
val
sola
a
he
was
in
consequence
well
equipped
to
combat
the
illusion
which
leads
so
many
to
imagine
that
were
their
circumstances
different
they
would
then
be
thoroughly
content
this
idea
is
presented
with
vivacious
ingenuity
in
a
dialogue
between
a
man
peddling
calendars
and
a
it
runs
somewhat
as
follows
calendars
new
calendars
for
the
coming
year
yes
sir
do
you
think
the
year
will
be
a
good
one
yes
indeed
sir
as
good
as
last
year
better
sir
better
as
year
before
last
much
better
sir
but
would
you
care
to
have
the
next
year
like
any
of
the
past
years
no
sir
i
would
not
for
how
long
have
you
been
selling
calendars
nearly
twenty
years
sir
well
which
of
these
twenty
years
would
you
wish
to
have
like
the
coming
one
i
i
really
do
know
sir
ca
you
remember
any
one
year
that
seemed
particularly
attractive
i
can
not
indeed
i
can
not
and
yet
life
is
very
pleasant
is
it
oh
yes
sir
we
all
know
that
would
you
not
be
glad
to
live
these
twenty
years
over
again
god
forbid
sir
but
supposing
you
had
to
live
your
life
over
again
i
would
not
do
it
but
what
life
would
you
care
to
live
mine
for
instance
or
that
of
a
prince
or
of
some
other
person
ah
sir
what
a
question
and
yet
do
you
not
see
that
i
or
the
prince
or
any
one
else
would
answer
precisely
as
you
do
and
that
no
one
would
consent
to
live
his
life
over
again
yes
sir
i
suppose
so
am
i
to
understand
then
that
you
would
not
live
your
life
over
again
no
sir
truly
i
would
not
what
life
would
you
care
for
then
i
would
like
without
any
other
condition
such
a
life
as
god
might
be
pleased
to
give
me
in
other
words
one
which
would
be
and
of
which
you
would
know
no
more
than
you
do
of
the
coming
year
exactly
well
then
that
is
what
i
would
like
too
it
is
what
every
one
would
like
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
up
to
this
time
there
is
no
one
whom
chance
has
not
badly
treated
every
one
agrees
that
the
misery
of
life
outbalances
its
pleasure
and
i
have
yet
to
meet
the
man
who
would
care
to
live
his
old
life
over
the
life
which
is
so
pleasant
is
not
the
life
with
which
we
are
personally
acquainted
it
is
another
life
not
the
life
that
we
have
lived
but
the
life
which
is
to
come
next
year
will
treat
us
all
better
it
will
be
the
beginning
of
a
happy
existence
do
you
not
think
it
will
indeed
i
hope
so
sir
show
me
your
best
calendar
this
one
sir
it
is
thirty
soldi
here
they
are
thank
you
sir
long
life
to
you
sir
calendars
new
calendars
there
are
few
scenes
as
clever
as
this
and
fewer
still
in
which
irony
and
humor
are
so
delicately
blended
and
yet
notwithstanding
its
studied
bitterness
there
is
little
doubt
that
its
author
clearly
perceived
that
life
does
hold
one
or
two
incontestable
charms
in
speaking
of
glory
pascal
noted
in
his
pensées
that
even
philosophers
seek
it
and
those
who
wrote
it
down
wished
the
reputation
of
having
written
it
down
well
to
this
rule
leopardi
was
no
exception
he
admitted
as
much
on
several
occasions
and
even
if
he
had
not
done
so
the
fact
would
have
been
none
the
less
evident
from
the
burnish
of
his
verse
and
the
purity
of
his
prose
which
was
not
that
of
a
writer
to
whom
the
opinion
of
others
was
indifferent
in
the
essay
therefore
in
which
he
attacks
the
illusion
of
literary
renown
he
reminds
one
forcibly
of
byron
hurrying
about
in
search
of
the
visible
isolation
which
that
poet
so
seriously
pursued
and
yet
while
no
other
writer
perhaps
has
been
more
thoroughly
given
to
than
the
author
of
childe
harold
there
are
few
who
have
been
so
entirely
devoid
of
affectation
as
leopardi
the
comparative
of
his
writings
however
was
hardly
calculated
to
make
him
view
with
any
great
enthusiasm
the
subject
of
literary
fame
and
as
moreover
he
considered
it
his
mission
to
besiege
all
illusions
he
held
up
this
one
in
particular
as
a
seductive
chimera
and
attacked
it
accordingly
in
the
ovvero
della
gloria
he
says
reflectively
before
an
author
can
reach
the
public
with
any
chance
of
being
judged
without
prejudice
think
of
the
amount
of
labor
which
he
expends
in
learning
how
to
write
the
difficulties
which
he
has
to
overcome
and
the
envious
voices
which
he
must
silence
and
even
then
what
does
the
public
amount
to
the
majority
of
readers
yawn
over
a
book
or
admire
it
because
some
one
else
has
admired
it
before
them
it
is
the
style
that
makes
a
book
immortal
and
as
it
requires
a
certain
education
to
be
a
judge
of
style
the
number
of
connoisseurs
is
necessarily
restricted
but
beyond
mere
form
there
must
also
be
depth
and
as
each
class
of
work
presupposes
a
special
competence
on
the
part
of
the
critic
it
is
easy
to
see
how
narrow
the
tribunal
is
which
decides
an
author
reputation
and
even
then
is
it
one
which
is
thoroughly
just
in
the
first
place
the
critic
even
when
competent
judges
and
in
that
he
is
but
human
according
to
the
impression
of
the
moment
and
according
to
the
tastes
which
age
or
circumstances
have
created
if
he
is
young
he
likes
brilliance
old
he
is
unimpressionable
great
reputations
are
made
in
great
cities
and
it
is
there
that
heart
and
mind
are
more
or
less
fatigued
a
first
impression
warped
in
this
way
may
often
become
final
for
if
it
be
true
that
valuable
works
should
be
and
are
only
appreciated
with
time
it
is
also
true
that
at
the
present
time
very
few
books
are
read
at
all
supposing
however
the
most
favorable
case
supposing
that
a
writer
through
the
suffrage
of
a
few
of
his
contemporaries
is
certain
of
descending
to
posterity
as
a
great
man
what
is
a
great
man
simply
a
name
which
in
a
short
time
will
represent
nothing
the
opinion
of
the
beautiful
changes
with
the
days
and
literary
reputations
are
at
the
mercy
of
their
variations
as
to
scientific
works
they
are
invariably
surpassed
or
forgotten
nowadays
any
mathematician
knows
more
than
galileo
or
newton
genius
then
is
a
sinister
gift
and
its
attendant
glory
but
a
vain
and
empty
shadow
the
life
of
leopardi
as
told
by
his
biographers
is
poetically
suggestive
of
the
story
of
the
pale
armide
who
burned
the
palace
that
enchanted
her
and
the
similarity
becomes
still
more
noticeable
when
he
is
found
hacking
and
hewing
at
the
illusion
of
love
personally
considered
leopardi
was
not
attractive
he
was
undersized
slightly
deformed
prematurely
bald
nervous
and
weak
and
though
physical
disadvantages
are
often
disregarded
by
women
and
not
infrequently
inspire
a
compassion
which
properly
tended
may
warm
into
love
yet
when
the
body
weak
and
infirm
as
was
his
incases
the
strength
and
lurid
vitality
of
genius
the
unlovable
monstrosity
is
complete
indeed
in
this
respect
it
may
be
noted
that
while
the
love
of
a
woman
for
a
coarse
and
stupid
ruffian
is
an
anomaly
of
daily
repetition
there
are
yet
few
instances
in
which
genius
even
when
strong
of
limb
has
succeeded
in
inspiring
a
great
and
enduring
affection
against
leopardi
then
the
house
of
love
was
doubly
barred
when
he
was
about
nineteen
he
watched
the
usual
young
girl
who
lives
over
the
way
and
with
a
which
seems
exquisitely
pathetic
he
made
no
sign
but
simply
watched
and
loved
the
young
lady
does
not
appear
to
have
been
in
any
way
conscious
of
the
mutely
shy
adoration
which
her
beauty
had
fanned
into
flame
and
at
any
rate
paid
no
attention
to
the
sickly
dwarf
across
the
street
she
sat
very
placidly
at
her
window
or
else
fluttered
about
the
room
humming
some
air
this
went
on
for
a
year
or
more
until
finally
she
was
carried
away
in
a
rumbling
coach
to
become
the
willing
bride
of
another
this
of
course
was
very
terrible
to
leopardi
through
some
inductive
process
which
ought
to
have
been
brought
about
by
the
electric
currents
which
he
was
establishing
from
behind
the
curtain
he
had
in
his
lawless
fancy
made
quite
sure
that
his
love
would
sooner
or
later
be
felt
and
reciprocated
when
therefore
from
his
hiding
place
he
saw
the
bride
depart
in
maiden
ignorance
of
her
conquest
and
entirely
unconscious
of
the
sonnets
which
had
been
written
in
her
praise
the
poet
one
sweet
hope
faded
slowly
with
her
this
pure
and
sedate
affection
remained
vibrant
in
his
memory
for
many
years
and
formed
the
theme
of
so
many
reveries
and
songs
that
love
finally
appeared
to
him
as
but
another
form
of
suffering
in
after
life
when
much
of
the
lustre
of
youthful
candor
had
become
dull
and
tarnished
he
besieged
the
heart
of
another
lady
but
this
time
in
a
bolder
and
more
enterprising
fashion
his
suit
however
was
unsuccessful
it
may
be
that
he
was
too
eloquent
for
eloquence
is
rarely
captivating
save
to
the
inexperienced
and
the
man
who
makes
love
in
rounded
phrases
seems
to
the
practised
eye
to
be
more
artistic
than
sincere
at
all
events
his
affection
was
not
returned
the
phantom
had
passed
very
close
but
all
he
had
clutched
was
the
air
he
was
soon
conscious
however
that
he
had
made
that
mistake
which
is
common
to
all
imaginative
people
it
was
not
the
woman
he
loved
it
was
beauty
not
woman
herself
but
the
ideal
it
was
a
conception
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
conception
which
the
woman
like
so
many
others
had
the
power
to
inspire
and
yet
lacked
the
ability
to
understand
this
time
leopardi
was
done
with
love
and
forthwith
attacked
it
as
the
last
yet
most
tenacious
of
all
illusions
it
is
he
said
an
error
like
the
others
but
one
which
is
more
deeply
rooted
because
when
all
else
is
gone
men
think
they
clutch
therein
the
last
shadow
of
departing
happiness
error
beato
he
adds
and
so
it
may
be
yet
is
he
not
well
answered
by
that
sage
saying
of
voltaire
aussi
a
son
mérite
it
was
in
this
way
that
leopardi
devastated
the
palace
from
whose
feasts
he
had
been
excluded
at
every
step
he
had
taken
he
had
left
some
hope
behind
he
had
been
dying
piecemeal
all
his
life
he
was
confessedly
miserable
and
this
not
alone
on
account
of
his
poverty
and
wretched
health
but
chiefly
because
of
his
lack
of
harmony
with
the
realities
of
existence
the
world
was
to
him
the
worst
one
possible
and
he
would
have
been
glad
to
adorn
the
gate
of
life
with
the
simplicity
of
dante
insistent
line
lasciate
ogni
speranza
voi
there
was
a
time
he
said
when
i
envied
the
ignorant
and
those
who
thought
well
of
themselves
i
envy
neither
the
ignorant
nor
the
wise
neither
the
great
nor
the
weak
i
envy
the
dead
and
i
would
only
change
with
them
this
of
course
was
purely
personal
toward
the
close
of
his
life
he
recognized
that
his
judgment
had
been
in
a
measure
warped
by
the
peculiar
misfortunes
of
his
own
position
but
in
so
doing
he
seemed
almost
to
be
depriving
himself
of
a
last
if
sad
consolation
nor
did
he
ever
wholly
recant
and
it
is
in
the
conception
of
the
universality
of
misery
which
stamped
all
his
writings
and
which
even
had
he
wished
he
was
then
powerless
to
alter
that
his
relation
to
the
theoretic
pessimism
of
chiefly
rests
as
a
creed
the
birthplace
of
pessimism
is
to
be
sought
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
or
far
back
in
the
of
nepaul
where
the
initiate
with
every
desire
lulled
awaits
nirvâna
and
murmurs
only
life
is
evil
now
as
is
well
known
in
every
religion
there
is
a
certain
metaphysical
basis
which
is
designed
to
supply
an
answer
to
man
first
question
for
while
the
animal
lives
in
undismayed
repose
man
of
all
created
things
alone
marvels
at
his
own
existence
and
at
the
destruction
of
his
fellows
to
his
first
question
then
what
is
life
and
death
each
system
attempts
to
offer
a
perfect
reply
indeed
the
temples
cathedrals
and
pagodas
clearly
attest
that
man
at
all
times
and
in
all
lands
has
continually
demanded
that
some
reply
should
be
given
and
it
is
perhaps
for
this
very
reason
that
where
other
beliefs
have
found
fervent
adherents
neither
materialism
nor
skepticism
have
been
ever
able
to
acquire
a
durable
influence
it
is
however
curious
to
note
that
in
attempting
the
answer
nearly
every
creed
has
given
an
unfavorable
interpretation
to
life
aside
from
the
glorious
lessons
of
christianity
its
teaching
in
brief
is
that
the
world
is
a
vale
of
tears
that
nothing
here
can
yield
any
real
satisfaction
and
that
happiness
which
is
not
for
mortals
is
solely
the
recompense
of
the
ransomed
soul
to
the
brahmin
while
there
is
always
the
hope
of
absorption
in
the
universal
spirit
life
meanwhile
is
a
regrettable
accident
but
in
buddhism
which
is
perhaps
the
most
naïve
and
yet
the
most
sublime
of
all
religions
and
which
through
its
very
combination
of
simplicity
and
grandeur
appeals
to
a
larger
number
of
adherents
than
any
other
pessimism
is
the
beginning
as
it
is
the
end
to
the
buddhist
there
is
reality
neither
in
the
future
nor
in
the
past
to
him
true
knowledge
consists
in
the
perception
of
the
nothingness
of
all
things
in
the
consciousness
of
the
vastness
of
the
agony
of
earth
the
vainness
of
its
joys
the
mockery
of
all
its
best
the
anguish
of
its
worst
and
in
the
desire
to
escape
from
the
evil
of
existence
into
the
entire
affranchisement
of
the
intelligence
to
the
buddhist
sorrow
is
shadow
to
life
moving
where
life
doth
move
the
buddhist
believes
that
the
soul
migrates
until
nirvâna
is
attained
and
that
in
the
preparation
for
this
state
which
is
the
death
of
death
the
nothingness
of
a
flame
extinguished
there
are
four
degrees
in
the
first
the
novitiate
learns
to
be
implacable
to
himself
yet
charitable
and
compassionate
to
others
he
then
acquires
an
understanding
into
the
nature
of
all
things
until
he
has
suppressed
every
desire
save
that
of
attaining
nirvâna
when
he
passes
initiate
into
the
second
degree
in
which
judgment
ceases
in
the
next
stage
the
vague
sentiment
of
satisfaction
which
had
been
derived
from
intellectual
perfection
is
lost
and
in
the
last
the
confused
consciousness
of
identity
disappears
it
is
at
this
point
that
nirvâna
begins
but
only
begins
and
stretches
to
vertiginous
heights
through
four
higher
degrees
of
ecstasy
of
which
the
first
is
the
region
of
infinity
in
space
the
next
the
realm
of
infinity
in
intelligence
then
the
sphere
in
which
nothing
is
and
finally
the
loss
of
even
the
perception
of
nothing
when
death
is
dead
when
all
have
attained
nirvâna
then
according
to
the
buddhist
the
universe
will
rock
forevermore
in
unconscious
rest
in
brief
then
life
to
the
christian
is
a
probation
to
the
brahmin
a
burden
to
the
buddhist
a
dream
and
to
the
pessimist
a
nightmare

the
high
priest
of
pessimism
arthur
schopenhauer
the
founder
of
the
present
school
was
born
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
in
the
now
mildewed
city
of
dantzic
his
people
came
of
good
dutch
stock
and
were
both
and
peculiar
his
grandmother
lost
her
reason
at
the
death
of
her
husband
a
circumstance
as
unusual
then
as
in
more
recent
years
his
two
uncles
passed
their
melancholy
lives
on
the
frontiers
of
insanity
and
his
father
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
which
his
end
fully
justified
this
latter
gentleman
was
a
rich
and
energetic
merchant
of
educated
tastes
and
excitable
disposition
who
when
well
advanced
in
middle
life
married
the
young
and
gifted
daughter
of
one
of
the
chief
magnates
of
the
town
their
union
was
not
more
unhappy
than
is
usually
the
case
under
similar
circumstances
his
time
being
generally
passed
with
his
ledger
and
hers
with
the
poets
with
increasing
years
however
his
untamable
petulance
grew
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
not
at
all
times
considered
perfectly
sane
and
it
is
related
that
on
being
visited
one
day
by
a
lifelong
acquaintance
who
announced
himself
as
an
old
friend
he
exclaimed
with
abrupt
indignation
friend
indeed
there
is
no
such
thing
besides
people
come
here
every
day
and
say
they
are
this
that
and
the
other
i
know
them
and
i
do
want
to
a
day
or
two
later
he
met
the
same
individual
greeted
him
with
cheerful
cordiality
and
led
him
amiably
home
to
dinner
shortly
after
he
threw
himself
from
his
warehouse
to
the
canal
below
he
had
always
intended
that
his
son
who
was
then
in
his
sixteenth
year
should
continue
the
business
and
to
prepare
him
properly
for
his
duties
he
had
christened
him
arthur
because
he
found
that
name
was
pretty
much
the
same
in
all
european
languages
and
furthermore
had
sent
the
lad
at
an
early
age
first
to
france
and
then
to
england
that
he
might
gain
some
acquaintance
and
familiarity
with
other
tongues
the
boy
liked
his
name
and
took
naturally
to
languages
but
he
felt
no
desire
to
utilize
these
possessions
in
the
depressing
atmosphere
of
commercial
life
and
after
his
father
death
loitered
first
at
the
benches
of
gotha
and
then
at
those
of
göttingen
meanwhile
his
mother
established
herself
at
weimar
where
she
soon
attracted
to
her
all
that
was
brilliant
in
that
brilliant
city
goethe
wieland
fernow
falk
grimm
and
the
two
schlegels
were
her
constant
guests
at
court
she
was
received
as
a
welcome
addition
and
such
an
effect
had
these
surroundings
upon
her
imagination
that
in
not
very
many
years
she
managed
to
produce
compact
volumes
of
criticism
and
romance
during
this
time
her
son
was
not
idle
thoroughly
familiar
with
ancient
as
with
modern
literature
he
devoted
his
first
year
at
göttingen
to
medicine
mathematics
and
history
while
in
his
second
which
he
passed
in
company
with
bunsen
and
william
astor
he
studied
physics
physiology
psychology
ethnology
and
logic
as
these
diversions
did
not
quite
fill
the
hour
he
aided
the
flight
of
idle
moments
with
a
guitar
he
was
at
this
time
a
singularly
young
man
possessing
a
grave
and
expressive
type
of
beauty
which
in
after
years
developed
into
that
suggestion
of
majestic
calm
for
which
the
head
of
beethoven
is
celebrated
while
to
his
lips
there
then
came
a
smile
as
relentlessly
implacable
as
that
of
voltaire
from
boyhood
he
had
been
of
a
thoughtful
disposition
finding
wisdom
in
the
falling
leaf
problems
in
vibrating
light
and
movement
in
immobility
already
he
had
wrung
his
hands
at
the
stars
and
watched
the
distant
future
rise
with
its
flouting
jeer
at
the
ills
of
man
in
this
however
there
was
little
of
the
cheap
sentimentalism
of
byron
and
less
of
the
weariness
of
lamartine
his
griefs
were
purely
objective
life
to
him
was
a
perplexing
riddle
whose
true
meaning
was
well
worth
a
search
and
as
the
only
possible
solution
of
the
gigantic
enigma
seemed
to
lie
in
some
unexplored
depth
of
metaphysics
he
soon
after
betook
himself
to
berlin
where
fichte
then
reigned
as
legitimate
successor
but
the
demonstrations
that
fichte
affected
his
tiresome
verbiage
lit
if
at
all
only
by
some
trivial
truism
or
trumpery
paradox
bored
schopenhauer
at
first
to
death
and
then
worked
on
his
nerves
to
such
an
extent
that
he
longed
pistol
in
hand
to
catch
at
his
throat
and
cry
die
like
a
dog
you
shall
but
for
your
pitiful
soul
sake
tell
me
if
in
all
this
rubbish
you
really
mean
anything
or
take
me
simply
for
an
imbecile
like
yourself
for
schopenhauer
it
should
be
understood
had
passed
his
nights
first
with
plato
and
then
with
kant
they
were
to
him
like
two
giants
calling
to
one
another
across
the
centuries
and
that
this
huckster
of
phrases
should
pretend
to
cloak
his
nakedness
with
their
mantle
seemed
to
him
at
once
indecent
and
absurd
schelling
pleased
him
no
better
he
dismissed
him
with
a
word
mountebank
but
for
hegel
as
he
was
wont
in
after
years
to
call
him
his
contempt
was
so
violent
that
with
a
prudence
which
is
both
amusing
and
characteristic
he
took
counsel
from
an
attorney
as
to
the
exact
limit
he
might
touch
in
abusing
him
without
becoming
amenable
to
a
suit
for
defamation
hegel
philosophy
he
said
is
a
crystalized
syllogism
it
is
an
abracadabra
a
puff
of
bombast
and
a
of
phrases
which
in
its
monstrous
construction
compels
the
mind
to
form
impossible
contradictions
and
in
itself
is
enough
to
cause
an
entire
atrophy
of
the
intellect
it
is
made
up
of
three
fourths
nonsense
and
one
fourth
error
it
contains
words
not
thoughts
and
then
rising
in
his
indignation
to
the
heights
of
quotation
he
added
stuff
as
madmen
tongue
and
brain
not
time
it
may
be
noted
has
to
a
great
extent
indorsed
schopenhauer
verdict
the
tortures
of
fichte
schelling
and
hegel
linger
now
in
the
history
of
philosophy
very
much
as
might
the
memory
of
a
nightmare
and
except
in
a
few
cobwebbed
halls
the
teachings
of
the
three
sophists
may
safely
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
inexplicable
past
it
should
not
however
be
supposed
that
because
he
found
the
philosophy
of
the
moment
so
little
to
his
taste
he
necessarily
squandered
his
time
on
the
contrary
he
turned
to
aristotle
and
spinoza
for
consolation
and
therewith
followed
sundry
lectures
in
magnetism
electricity
ichthyology
amphiology
ornithology
zoölogy
and
astronomy
all
of
which
he
enlivened
with
rapid
incursions
to
the
rich
granaries
of
rabelais
and
montaigne
and
moreover
gave
no
little
time
to
the
study
of
the
religion
and
philosophy
of
india
it
was
at
this
time
characteristic
of
the
man
that
while
his
appearance
wealth
and
connections
would
have
formed
an
open
letter
to
the
best
society
in
berlin
which
was
then
heterogeneously
agreeable
or
even
to
the
worst
which
is
said
to
have
been
charming
he
preferred
to
pass
his
leisure
hours
in
scrutinizing
the
animals
in
the
zoölogical
gardens
and
in
studying
the
inmates
of
the
state
lunatic
asylum
in
this
his
attention
was
particularly
claimed
by
two
unfortunates
who
while
perfectly
conscious
of
their
infirmity
were
yet
unable
to
master
it
in
proof
of
which
one
wrote
him
a
series
of
sonnets
and
the
other
sent
him
annotated
passages
from
the
bible
in
the
second
year
of
his
student
life
at
berlin
the
war
of
was
declared
and
schopenhauer
was
in
consequence
obliged
to
leave
the
city
before
he
had
obtained
his
degree
he
prepared
however
and
forwarded
to
the
faculty
at
jena
an
elaborate
thesis
which
he
entitled
the
quadruple
root
of
conclusive
reason
a
name
which
somewhat
astounded
his
mother
who
asked
him
if
it
were
something
for
the
apothecary
and
meanwhile
prowled
about
weimar
meditating
on
the
philosophy
which
he
had
long
intended
to
produce
he
visited
no
one
but
goethe
took
umbrage
at
his
mother
probably
harmless
relations
with
fernow
treated
her
to
discourse
not
dissimilar
to
that
which
hamlet
had
addressed
to
his
own
parent
received
his
degree
from
jena
and
then
went
off
to
dresden
where
he
began
to
study
women
with
that
microscopic
eye
which
he
turned
on
all
subjects
that
engaged
his
attention
the
result
of
these
studies
was
an
essay
on
the
metaphysics
of
love
which
he
thereupon
attached
to
his
budding
system
of
philosophy
an
axiom
to
the
effect
that
women
are
rich
in
hair
and
poor
in
thought
and
the
same
misadventure
that
befell
descartes
his
life
at
dresden
was
necessarily
much
less
secluded
than
that
to
which
he
had
been
hitherto
accustomed
he
became
an
at
the
opera
and
comedy
a
frequent
guest
in
literary
and
social
circles
and
as
student
of
men
and
things
he
went
about
disturbing
draperies
and
disarranging
screens
very
much
as
any
other
philosopher
might
do
who
was
bent
on
seeing
the
world
meanwhile
he
was
not
otherwise
idle
the
morning
he
gave
to
work
and
in
the
afternoon
he
surrendered
himself
to
nature
whom
he
loved
with
a
passionate
devotion
which
increased
with
his
years
the
companionship
of
men
was
always
more
or
less
irksome
to
him
and
while
it
was
less
so
perhaps
at
this
time
than
at
any
other
it
was
nevertheless
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
he
struck
out
across
the
inviting
of
saxony
or
down
the
banks
of
the
elbe
and
left
humanity
behind
in
search
of
that
solitude
which
is
nature
nearest
friend
in
the
companionship
of
others
he
was
constantly
seeking
a
trait
or
a
suggestion
some
hint
capable
of
development
when
in
the
world
therefore
he
flashed
a
lantern
so
to
speak
at
people
and
then
passed
them
by
but
in
the
open
country
he
communed
with
himself
and
strolled
along
in
hand
jotting
down
the
thoughts
worth
jotting
very
much
after
the
manner
that
emerson
is
said
to
have
recommended
with
regard
to
the
majority
of
men
it
will
not
seem
reckless
to
say
that
their
end
and
aim
is
happiness
and
but
however
trite
the
remark
may
be
it
may
still
perhaps
serve
to
bring
into
relief
something
of
schopenhauer
distinctive
purpose
it
would
of
course
be
foolish
to
assert
that
he
did
not
care
for
his
own
happiness
and
disregarded
his
own
satisfaction
for
of
these
things
few
men
it
is
imagined
have
thought
more
highly
if
his
ideas
of
happiness
diverged
widely
from
those
generally
received
as
standards
it
has
but
little
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
for
the
point
which
is
intended
to
be
conveyed
is
simply
that
above
all
other
things
beyond
the
culture
of
self
that
which
schopenhauer
cared
for
most
was
truth
and
that
he
pursued
it
moreover
as
pertinaciously
as
any
other
thinker
whom
the
world
now
honors
whether
he
ran
it
to
earth
or
not
the
reader
must
himself
decide
indeed
it
was
very
many
years
before
any
one
even
heard
that
he
had
been
chasing
it
at
all
of
late
however
some
of
the
best
pickets
who
guard
the
literary
outposts
from
boston
to
bombay
have
brought
a
very
positive
assurance
that
he
did
catch
it
and
moreover
held
it
fast
long
enough
to
wring
out
some
singularly
valuable
intimations
in
hurrying
along
after
his
quarry
schopenhauer
became
convinced
that
life
was
a
lesson
which
most
men
learned
trippingly
enough
but
whose
moral
they
failed
to
detect
and
this
moral
which
he
felt
he
had
caught
on
the
wing
as
it
were
he
set
about
dissecting
with
a
great
and
sumptuous
variety
of
reflection
wandering
then
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
massing
his
thoughts
and
arranging
their
progression
his
system
slowly
yet
gradually
expanded
before
him
he
wrote
only
in
moments
of
inspiration
yet
his
hours
were
full
of
such
moments
little
by
little
he
drifted
away
from
the
opera
and
his
friends
into
a
solitude
which
he
made
populous
with
thought
and
in
this
manner
gave
himself
up
so
entirely
to
his
philosophy
that
one
day
it
is
reported
he
astonished
an
who
asked
him
who
he
was
with
the
weird
and
pensive
answer
ah
if
i
but
knew
myself
meanwhile
his
work
grew
rapidly
beneath
his
hands
and
when
after
four
years
of
labor
and
research
die
welt
als
wille
und
vorstellung
was
so
far
completed
as
to
permit
its
publication
he
read
it
over
with
something
of
the
same
unfamiliarity
which
he
would
have
experienced
in
reading
the
work
of
another
author
though
doubtless
with
greater
satisfaction
fascinated
with
its
merits
he
offered
the
manuscript
to
brockhaus
the
leipsic
publisher
my
book
he
wrote
is
a
new
system
of
philosophy
but
when
i
say
new
i
mean
new
in
every
sense
of
the
word
it
is
not
a
restatement
of
what
has
been
already
expressed
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
a
continuous
flow
of
thought
such
as
has
never
before
entered
the
mind
of
mortal
man
it
is
a
book
which
in
my
opinion
is
destined
to
rank
with
those
which
form
the
source
and
incentive
to
hundreds
of
others
brockhaus
familiar
with
the
proverbial
modesty
of
young
authors
lent
but
an
inattentive
ear
to
these
alluring
statements
and
accepted
the
book
solely
on
account
of
the
reputation
which
schopenhauer
mother
then
enjoyed
a
mark
of
confidence
by
the
way
which
he
soon
deeply
regretted
it
is
so
much
waste
paper
he

schopenhauer
philosophy
first
appeared
in
but
while
it
was
still
in
press
its
author
like
one
who
has
sprung
a
mine
and
fears
the
report
fled
away
to
italy
where
he
wandered
about
from
venice
to
naples
bathing
his
senses
in
color
and
music
he
associated
at
this
time
very
willingly
with
englishmen
and
especially
with
english
artists
and
men
of
letters
germans
and
americans
he
avoided
and
as
for
jews
he
not
only
detested
them
but
expressed
an
admiring
approval
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
only
regretted
that
he
had
been
so
lenient
with
them
the
jews
are
god
chosen
people
are
they
he
would
say
very
good
tastes
differ
they
certainly
are
not
mine
in
this
dislike
he
made
no
exception
and
scenting
in
after
years
some
of
the
on
heine
and
meyerbeer
he
refused
them
the
attention
which
others
were
only
too
glad
to
accord
distaste
however
for
everything
that
savored
of
the
israelite
will
be
perhaps
more
readily
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
jews
as
a
race
are
optimists
and
their
creed
therefore
to
him
in
his
consistency
was
like
the
aggressive
flag
to
the
typical
bull
with
the
germans
he
had
another
grievance
the
germans
he
said
are
heavy
by
nature
it
is
a
national
characteristic
and
one
which
is
noticeable
not
only
in
the
way
they
carry
themselves
but
in
their
language
their
fiction
their
conversation
their
writings
their
way
of
thinking
and
especially
in
their
style
and
in
their
mania
for
constructing
long
and
involved
sentences
in
reading
german
he
continued
memory
is
obliged
to
retain
mechanically
as
in
a
lesson
the
words
that
are
forced
upon
it
until
after
patient
labor
a
period
is
reached
the
keynote
is
found
and
the
meaning
disentangled
when
the
germans
he
added
get
hold
of
a
vague
and
unsuitable
expression
which
will
completely
obscure
their
meaning
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
great
aim
is
to
leave
an
opening
in
every
phrase
through
which
they
may
seem
to
come
back
and
say
more
than
they
thought
in
this
trick
they
excel
and
if
they
can
manage
to
be
emphatic
and
affected
at
the
same
time
they
are
simply
afloat
in
a
sea
of
joy
foreigners
hate
all
this
and
revenge
themselves
in
reading
german
as
little
as
possible
wherefore
in
provision
of
my
death
i
acknowledge
that
on
account
of
its
infinite
stupidity
i
loathe
the
german
nation
and
that
i
blush
to
belong

at
various
schopenhauer
had
encountered
traveling
yankees
and
objected
to
them
accordingly
they
are
he
said
the
of
the
world
partly
i
suppose
on
account
of
their
republican
government
and
partly
because
they
descend
from
those
who
left
europe
for
europe
good
the
climate
too
he
added
reflectively
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
nor
did
frenchmen
escape
his
satire
other
parts
of
the
world
have
monkeys
europe
has
frenchmen
but
with
englishmen
he
got
on
very
well
and
during
his
after
life
always
talked
to
himself
in
their
tongue
wrote
his
memoranda
in
english
and
read
the
times
daily
advertisements
and
all
meanwhile
schopenhauer
held
his
hand
to
his
ear
unavailingly
from
across
the
alps
there
came
to
him
no
echo
of
any
report
only
a
silence
which
was
ominous
enough
to
have
assured
any
other
that
the
fusee
had
not
been
properly
applied
but
to
him
it
was
different
he
had
it
is
true
expected
a
reverberation
which
would
shake
the
sophistry
of
all
civilization
and
when
no
tremor
came
he
was
mystified
but
only
for
the
moment
he
had
been
too
much
accustomed
to
seek
his
own
dead
in
the
great
morgue
of
literature
not
to
know
that
any
man
who
is
to
belong
to
posterity
is
necessarily
a
stranger
to
his
epoch
and
that
he
was
to
belong
to
posterity
he
had
no
possible
doubt
indeed
he
had
that
prescience
of
genius
which
foresees
its
own
future
and
he
felt
that
however
tightly
the
bushel
might
be
closed
over
the
light
there
were
still
crevices
through
which
it
yet
would
shine
and
from
which
at
last
some
conflagration
must
necessarily
burst
it
was
part
of
the
man
to
analyze
all
things
and
while
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
lack
of
attention
with
which
his
philosophy
had
been
received
left
him
entirely
unmoved
it
would
be
incorrect
to
suppose
that
he
was
then
sitting
on
the
pins
and
needles
of
impatience
deeply
reflective
he
was
naturally
aware
that
as
everything
which
is
exquisite
ripens
slowly
so
is
the
growth
of
fame
proportioned
to
its
durability
and
schopenhauer
meant
to
be
famous
and
this
not
so
much
for
fame
sake
as
for
the
good
which
his
fame
would
spread
with
it
he
could
therefore
well
afford
to
wait
his
work
was
not
written
especially
to
his
own
epoch
save
only
in
so
far
as
his
epoch
was
part
of
humanity
collectively
considered
it
did
not
therefore
take
him
long
to
understand
that
as
his
work
was
not
tinted
with
any
of
the
local
color
and
fugitive
caprices
of
the
moment
it
was
in
consequence
unadapted
to
an
immediate
and
fictitious
vogue
indeed
it
may
be
added
that
the
history
of
art
and
literature
is
eloquent
with
the
examples
of
the
masterpieces
which
unrewarded
by
contemporary
appreciation
have
passed
into
the
welcome
of
another
age
and
of
these
examples
few
are
more
striking
than
that
of
the
absolute
indifference
with
which
schopenhauer
philosophy
was
first
received
it
was
presumably
with
reflections
of
this
nature
that
schopenhauer
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
the
inattention
under
which
he
labored
and
wandered
serenely
among
the
treasuries
and
ghosts
of
departed
rome
about
this
time
an
incident
happened
which
while
not
possessing
any
very
vivid
interest
so
affected
his
after
life
as
to
be
at
least
deserving
of
passing
notice
schopenhauer
was
then
in
his
year
on
coming
of
age
he
had
received
his
share
of
his
property
some
of
which
he
securely
invested
but
the
greater
part
he
deposited
at
high
interest
with
a
business
house
in
dantzic
when
leaving
for
italy
he
took
from
this
firm
notes
payable
on
demand
for
the
amount
which
they
held
to
his
credit
and
after
he
had
cashed
one
of
their
bills
learned
that
the
firm
was
in
difficulties
shortly
after
they
suspended
payment
offering
thirty
per
cent
to
those
of
their
creditors
who
were
willing
to
accept
such
an
arrangement
and
nothing
to
those
who
refused
all
the
creditors
accepted
save
schopenhauer
who
with
the
wile
of
a
diplomat
wrote
that
he
was
in
no
hurry
for
his
money
but
that
perhaps
if
he
were
made
preferred
creditor
he
might
accept
a
better
offer
his
debtors
fell
into
the
trap
and
offered
him
first
fifty
and
then
seventy
per
cent
these
offers
he
also
refused
if
he
wrote
you
offer
me
thirty
per
cent
when
you
are
able
to
pay
fifty
and
fifty
per
cent
when
you
are
able
to
pay
seventy
i
have
good
reason
to
suspect
that
you
can
pay
the
whole
amount
in
any
event
my
right
is
perennial
i
need
not
present
my
notes
until
i
care
to
settle
with
your
other
creditors
and
then
you
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
attend
to
me
a
wise
man
watches
the
burning
phœnix
with
a
certain
pleasure
for
he
well
knows
what
that
crafty
bird
does
with
its
ashes
keep
my
money
and
i
will
keep
your
drafts
when
your
affairs
are
straightened
either
we
will
exchange
or
you
will
be
arrested
for
debt
i
am
of
course
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
oblige
you
and
i
dare
say
you
think
me
very
disagreeable
but
that
is
only
an
illusion
of
yours
which
is
at
once
dispelled
when
you
remember
that
the
money
is
my
own
and
that
its
possession
concerns
my
lifelong
freedom
and
you
will
say
perhaps
that
if
all
your
creditors
thought
as
i
do
it
would
be
deuced
hard
for
me
but
if
all
men
thought
as
i
do
not
only
would
more
be
thought
but
there
would
probably
be

bankrupts

where
the
crowd
can
find
no
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
patience
and
after
a
few
more
dagger
thrusts
of
this
description
schopenhauer
recovered
the
entire
amount
which
was
due
him
together
with
the
interest
in
full
but
the
danger
which
he
had
so
cleverly
avoided
gave
him
so
to
speak
a
retrospective
shock
the
possibility
of
want
had
brushed
too
near
for
comfort
sake
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
and
in
shuddering
at
the
cause
of
his
fright
he
experienced
such
a
feeling
of
insecurity
with
regard
to
what
the
future
might
yet
hold
that
he
determined
to
lose
no
time
in
seeking
a
remunerative
shelter
with
this
object
he
returned
to
berlin
and
as
began
to
lecture
on
the
history
of
philosophy
hegel
was
then
in
the
high
tide
of
his
glory
scholars
from
far
and
near
came
to
listen
to
the
man
who
had
compared
himself
to
christ
and
said
i
am
truth
and
teach
truth
in
the
reisebilder
heine
says
that
in
the
learned
caravansary
of
berlin
the
camels
collected
about
the
fountain
of
hegelian
wisdom
kneeled
down
received
their
burden
of
precious
waters
and
then
set
out
across
the
desert
wastes
of
brandenburg
at
that
time
not
to
bend
before
hegel
was
the
blackest
and
most
wanton
of
sins
to
disagree
with
him
was
heretical
and
as
few
understood
his
meaning
clearly
enough
to
attempt
to
controvert
it
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
in
those
days
there
was
very
little
heresy
in
berlin
among
the
few
however
schopenhauer
headed
the
list
i
write
to
be
understood
he
said
and
indeed
no
one
who
came
in
contact
with
him
or
with
his
works
had
ever
the
least
difficulty
in
seizing
his
meaning
and
understanding
his
immense
disgust
for
the
pachyderm
hydrocephali
pedantic
eunuchs
apocaliptic
retinue
della
bestia
triumphante
as
in
after
years
with
gorgeous
emphasis
he
was
wont
to
designate
hegel
and
his
clique
the
war
that
he
waged
against
them
was
truly
homeric
he
denounced
hegel
in
a
manner
that
would
have
made
swinburne
blush
then
he
attacked
the
professors
of
philosophy
in
general
and
the
hegelians
in
particular
and
finally
the
demagogues
who
believed
in
them
and
who
had
baptized
themselves
young
germany
for
the
preparation
of
such
writings
as
theirs
he
had
a
receipt
which
was
homeopathic
in
its
simplicity
dilute
a
minimum
of
thought
in
five
hundred
pages
of
nauseous
phraseology
and
for
the
rest
trust
to
the
german
patience
of
the
reader
he
also
suggested
that
for
the
wonder
and
astonishment
of
posterity
every
public
library
should
carefully
preserve
in
half
calf
the
complete
works
of
the
great
philosophaster
and
his
adorers
and
considering
very
correctly
that
philosophers
can
not
be
hatched
like
bachelors
of
arts
he
further
recommended
that
the
course
in
philosophy
should
be
cut
from
the
university
programmes
and
the
teaching
in
that
branch
be
limited
to
logic
you
ca
write
an
iliad
he
said
when
your
mother
is
a
dolt
and
your
father
is
a
cotton
nightcap
there
are
few
debts
which
are
so
faithfully
acquitted
as
those
of
contempt
and
as
schopenhauer
kicked
down
every
screen
tore
off
every
mask
and
jeered
at
every
sham
it
would
be
a
great
stretch
of
fancy
to
imagine
that
he
was
a
popular
teacher
but
this
at
least
may
be
said
he
was
courageous
and
he
was
strong
of
purpose
in
the
end
he
dragged
germany
from
her
lethargy
and
rather
than
take
any
other
part
in
hegelism
than
that
of
spectre
at
the
feast
he
condemned
himself
to
an
almost
lifelong
obscurity
if
therefore
he
seems
at
times
too
bitter
and
too
relentless
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
man
whom
germany
now
honors
as
one
of
her
greatest
philosophers
fought
for
thirty
years
and
routed
the
enemy
at
last
by
the
mere
force
and
lash
of
his
words
but
in
the
mean
time
while
hegel
was
holding
forth
to
crowded
halls
his
rival
who
out
of
sheer
bravado
had
chosen
the
same
hours
lectured
to
an
audience
of
about
half
a
dozen
persons
among
whom
a
dentist
a
and
a
captain
on
half
pay
were
the
more
noteworthy
such
listeners
were
hardly
calculated
to
make
him
frantically
attached
to
the
calling
he
had
chosen
and
accordingly
at
the
end
of
the
first
semester
he
left
the
empty
benches
to
take
care
of
themselves
early
in
life
schopenhauer
wrote
in
english
in
his
matrimony
war
and
want
and
when
the
had
been
decently
buried
and
the
crape
grown
rusty
he
began
to
consider
this
little
sentence
with
much
attention
as
will
be
seen
later
on
he
objected
to
women
as
a
class
on
purely
logical
grounds
they
interfered
with
his
plan
of
delivering
the
world
from
suffering
but
against
the
individual
he
had
no
marked
dislike
only
a
few
pleasing
epigrams
during
his
dresden
sojourn
as
in
his
journey
to
italy
he
had
knelt
in
his
quality
of
philosopher
who
was
seeing
the
world
at
many
and
diverse
shrines
and
had
in
no
sense
wandered
from
them
but
all
that
had
been
very
different
from
assuming
legal
responsibilities
and
whenever
he
thought
with
favor
of
the
of
which
as
married
man
he
would
be
the
object
the
phantom
of
a
milliner
bill
loomed
in
double
columns
before
him
should
he
or
should
he
not
he
queried
fall
into
the
trap
which
nature
has
set
for
all
men
the
question
of
love
did
not
enter
into
the
matter
at
all
he
believed
in
love
as
most
people
believe
in
william
tell
that
is
as
something
very
inspiring
especially
when
treated
by
rossini
but
otherwise
as
a
myth
nor
did
he
need
montaigne
hint
to
be
assured
that
men
marry
for
others
and
not
for
themselves
the
subject
therefore
was
somewhat
complex
on
the
one
side
stood
the
attention
and
admiration
which
he
craved
and
on
the
other
an
eternal
farewell
to
that
untrammeled
freedom
which
is
the
thinker
natural
heath
the
die
however
had
to
be
cast
then
or
never
he
was
getting
on
in
life
and
an
opportunity
had
at
that
time
presented
itself
a
repetition
of
which
seemed
unlikely
after
much
reflection
and
much
weighing
of
the
pros
and
cons
he
concluded
that
it
is
the
married
man
who
supports
the
full
burden
of
life
while
the
bachelor
bears
but
half
and
it
is
to
the
latter
class
he
argued
that
the
courtesan
of
the
muses
should
belong
thereupon
with
a
luxury
of
reminiscence
and
quotation
which
was
usual
to
him
at
all
times
he
strengthened
his
resolution
with
mental
to
the
effect
that
descartes
leibnitz
malebranche
and
kant
were
bachelors
the
great
poets
uniformly
married
and
uniformly
unhappy
and
supported
it
all
with
bacon
statement
that
he
that
hath
wife
and
children
has
given
hostages
to
fortune
for
they
are
impediments
to
great
enterprises
either
of
virtue
or
of
mischief
in
the
cholera
appeared
in
berlin
and
schopenhauer
who
called
himself
a
choleraphobe
by
profession
fled
before
it
in
search
of
a
milder
and
healthier
climate
frankfort
he
chose
for
his
hermitage
and
from
that
time
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
which
occurred
in
september
he
continued
to
live
there
in
great
peace
and
tranquillity
schopenhauer
should
in
no
wise
be
represented
as
having
passed
his
life
in
building
dungeons
in
spain
like
every
true
scholar
he
was
in
the
absence
of
his
peers
able
to
live
with
great
comfort
with
the
dead
he
was
something
of
a
mezzofanti
he
spoke
and
read
half
a
dozen
languages
with
perfect
ease
and
he
could
in
consequence
enter
any
library
with
the
certainty
of
finding
friends
and
relations
therein
for
the
companionship
of
others
he
did
not
care
a
rap
he
was
never
so
lonely
as
when
associating
with
other
people
and
of
all
things
that
he
disliked
the
most
and
a
catalogue
of
his
dislikes
would
fill
a
chapter
the
entertainment
headed
the
obnoxious
list
he
had
taken
off
one
by
one
the
different
layers
of
the
social
nut
and
in
nibbling
at
the
kernel
he
found
its
insipidity
so
great
that
he
had
small
approval
for
those
who
made
it
part
of
their
ordinary
diet
it
should
not
however
be
supposed
that
this
dislike
for
society
and
the
companionship
of
others
sprang
from
any
of
that
necessity
for
solitude
which
is
noticeable
in
certain
cases
of
hypochondria
it
was
simply
due
to
the
fact
that
he
could
not
in
the
general
run
of
men
find
any
one
with
whom
he
could
associate
on
a
footing
of
equality
if
voltaire
helvetius
kant
or
cabanais
or
for
that
matter
any
one
possessed
of
original
thoughts
had
dwelled
in
the
neighborhood
schopenhauer
once
in
a
while
would
have
delighted
in
supping
with
them
but
as
agreeable
symposiasts
were
infrequent
he
was
of
necessity
thrown
entirely
on
his
own
resources
his
history
in
brief
is
that
of
the
malediction
under
which
king
and
genius
labor
equally
both
are
condemned
to
solitude
and
for
solitude
such
as
theirs
there
is
neither
chart
nor
compass
of
course
there
are
many
other
men
who
in
modern
times
have
also
led
lives
of
great
seclusion
but
in
this
respect
it
may
confidently
be
stated
that
no
thinker
of
recent
years
thoreau
not
excepted
has
ever
lived
in
isolation
more
thorough
and
complete
than
that
which
was
enjoyed
by
this
blithe
misanthrope
it
is
not
as
though
he
had
betaken
himself
to
an
unfrequented
waste
or
to
the
top
of
an
inaccessible
crag
such
behavior
would
have
savored
of
an
affectation
of
which
he
was
incapable
and
moreover
would
have
told
its
story
of
an
inability
to
otherwise
resist
the
charms
of
society
besides
schopenhauer
was
no
anchorite
he
lived
very
comfortably
in
the
heart
of
a
populous
and
pleasant
city
and
dined
daily
at
the
best
but
he
lived
and
dined
utterly
alone
he
considered
that
as
a
rule
a
man
is
never
in
perfect
harmony
save
with
himself
for
he
argued
however
tenderly
a
friend
or
mistress
may
be
beloved
there
is
at
times
some
clash
and
discord
perfect
tranquillity
he
said
is
found
only
in
solitude
and
to
be
permanent
only
in
absolute
seclusion
and
he
insisted
that
the
hermit
if
intellectually
rich
enjoys
the
happiest
condition
which
this
life
can
offer
the
love
of
solitude
however
can
hardly
be
said
to
exist
in
any
one
as
a
natural
instinct
on
the
contrary
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
acquired
taste
and
one
which
must
be
developed
in
indirect
progression
schopenhauer
who
cultivated
it
to
its
most
supreme
expression
admitted
that
at
first
he
had
many
fierce
struggles
with
the
natural
instinct
of
sociability
and
at
times
had
strenuously
combated
some
such
mephistophelian
suggestion
as
hör
auf
mit
deinem
gram
zu
spielen
der
wie
ein
geier
dir
am
leben
frisst
die
schlechteste
gesellschaft
lässt
dich
fühlen
dass
du
ein
mensch
mit
menschen
bist
but
solitude
more
or
less
rigid
is
undoubtedly
the
lot
of
all
superior
minds
they
may
grieve
over
it
as
schopenhauer
says
but
of
two
evils
they
will
choose
it
as
the
least
after
that
it
is
presumably
but
a
question
of
getting
acclimated
in
old
age
the
inclination
comes
he
notes
almost
of
itself
at
sixty
it
is
instinctive
at
that
age
everything
is
in
its
favor
the
incentives
which
are
the
most
energetic
in
behalf
of
sociability
then
no
longer
act
with
advancing
years
there
arises
a
capacity
of
sufficing
to
self
which
little
by
little
absorbs
the
social
instinct
illusions
then
have
faded
and
ordinarily
speaking
active
life
has
ceased
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
expected
there
are
no
plans
nor
projects
to
form
the
generation
to
which
old
age
really
belongs
has
passed
away
and
surrounded
by
a
new
race
one
is
then
objectively
and
essentially
alone
then
too
many
things
are
clearly
seen
which
before
were
as
veiled
by
a
mist
as
the
result
of
long
experience
very
little
is
expected
from
the
majority
of
people
and
the
conclusion
is
generally
reached
that
not
only
men
do
not
improve
on
acquaintance
but
that
mankind
is
made
up
of
very
defective
copies
with
which
it
is
best
to
have
as
little
to
do
as
possible
but
beyond
converting
his
life
into
a
monodrama
with
reflections
of
this
description
schopenhauer
considered
himself
to
be
a
missionary
of
truth
and
in
consequence
as
little
fitted
for
companionship
as
missionaries
in
china
feel
themselves
called
upon
to
fraternize
with
the
chinese
it
was
the
rule
of
his
life
to
expect
nothing
desire
as
little
as
possible
and
learn
all
he
could
and
as
little
was
to
be
expected
and
nothing
was
to
be
learned
from
the
majority
of
the
dull
ruffians
who
go
to
the
making
of
the
census
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
he
trod
the
thoroughfares
of
thought
alone
and
dismissed
the
majority
of
men
with
a
shrug
they
are
he
said
just
what
they
seem
to
be
and
that
is
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
them
epigrams
of
this
description
were
naturally
not
apt
to
increase
his
popularity
but
for
that
he
cared
very
little
he
considered
that
no
man
can
judge
another
save
by
the
measure
of
his
own
understanding
of
course
if
this
understanding
is
of
a
low
degree
the
greatest
intellectual
gifts
which
another
may
possess
convey
to
him
no
meaning
they
are
as
colors
to
the
blind
and
consequently
in
a
great
nature
there
will
be
noticed
only
those
defects
and
weaknesses
which
are
inseparable
from
every
character
but
to
such
a
man
as
schopenhauer
one
who
considered
five
sixths
of
the
population
to
be
knaves
or
blockheads
and
who
had
thought
out
a
system
for
the
remaining
fraction
to
such
a
man
as
he
the
question
of
esteem
or
the
lack
thereof
was
of
small
consequence
he
cared
nothing
for
the
existence
which
he
led
in
the
minds
of
other
people
to
his
own
self
he
was
true
to
the
calling
of
his
destiny
constant
and
he
felt
that
he
could
sit
and
snap
his
fingers
at
the
world
knowing
that
time
who
is
at
least
a
gentleman
would
bring
him
his
due
unasked
schopenhauer
character
was
made
up
of
that
combination
of
seeming
contradictions
which
is
the
peculiarity
of
all
great
men
he
had
the
audacity
of
childhood
and
the
timidity
of
genius
he
was
suspicious
of
every
one
and
ineffably
with
stupidity
in
any
form
he
was
blunt
even
to
violence
and
yet
his
manner
and
courtesy
were
such
as
is
attributed
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
old
school
if
he
was
an
egotist
he
was
also
charitable
to
excess
and
who
shall
say
that
charity
is
not
the
egotism
of
great
natures
he
was
honesty
itself
and
yet
thought
every
one
wished
to
cheat
him
to
mislead
a
possible
thief
he
labeled
his
valuables
arcana
medica
put
his
banknotes
in
dictionaries
and
his
gold
pieces
in
ink
bottles
he
slept
on
the
ground
floor
that
he
might
escape
easily
in
case
of
fire
if
he
heard
a
noise
at
night
he
snatched
at
a
pistol
which
he
kept
loaded
at
his
bedside
indeed
he
might
have
chosen
for
his
motto
je
ne
crains
rien
fors
le
dangier
and
yet
who
is
ever
so
foolish
as
a
wise
man
biography
is
full
of
similar
vagaries
and
one
has
but
to
turn
to
the
history
of
any
of
the
thinkers
whose
names
are
landmarks
in
literature
to
find
that
eccentricities
no
less
striking
have
also
been
recorded
of
them
voltaire
said
on
aime
la
vie
mais
le
néant
ne
laisse
pas
du
bon
and
schopenhauer
not
to
be
outdone
added
more
massively
that
if
one
could
tap
on
the
tombs
and
ask
the
dead
if
they
cared
to
return
they
would
shake
their
heads
his
views
of
life
however
and
of
the
world
in
general
will
be
considered
later
on
and
for
the
moment
it
is
but
necessary
to
note
that
he
regarded
happiness
as
consisting
solely
in
the
absence
of
pain
and
laid
down
as
one
of
the
supreme
rules
for
the
proper
conduct
of
life
that
discontent
should
be
banished
as
far
as
possible
into
the
outer
darkness
when
therefore
to
this
emerson
in
black
there
came
those
moments
of
restlessness
and
dissatisfaction
which
visit
even
the
most
philosophic
he
would
argue
with
himself
in
a
way
which
was
almost
pathetic
and
certainly
naïve
it
was
not
he
that
was
moody
and
out
of
sorts
it
was
some
lecturing
to
empty
halls
some
one
who
was
abused
by
the
philistines
some
defendant
in
a
suit
for
damages
some
one
whose
fortune
was
engulfed
perhaps
beyond
recovery
some
lover
pleading
to
inattentive
ears
some
one
attacked
by
one
of
the
thousand
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
yet
this
was
not
he
these
things
truly
he
might
have
endured
and
suffered
as
one
bears
for
a
moment
an
shoe
but
now
the
foot
no
longer
ached
indeed
he
was
none
of
all
this
he
was
the
author
of
the
welt
als
wille
und
vorstellung
and
what
had
the
days
to
do
with
him
but
through
all
the
intervening
years
the
book
had
lain
unnoticed
on
the
back
shelves
of
the
leipsic
publisher
and
schopenhauer
who
had
at
first
been
puzzled
but
never
disheartened
at
the
silence
which
had
settled
about
it
became
convinced
that
through
the
influence
of
the
three
sophists
at
berlin
all
mention
of
its
merit
had
been
suppressed
from
the
start
i
am
he
said
the
iron
mask
the
caspar
hauser
of
philosophy
and
thereupon
he
pictured
the
hegelians
as
looking
admiringly
at
his
system
very
much
as
the
man
in
the
fairy
tale
looked
at
the
genie
in
the
bottle
which
had
he
allowed
it
to
come
out
would
carry
him
off
truth
however
which
is
can
always
afford
to
wait
and
schopenhauer
with
something
of
the
complacency
of
genius
that
is
in
advance
of
its
era
held
his
fingers
on
the
public
pulse
and
noted
the
quickening
which
precedes
a
return
to
consciousness
germany
was
waking
from
her
torpor
already
the
influence
of
hegel
had
begun
to
wane
his
school
was
split
into
factions
and
his
philosophy
which
in
solving
every
problem
had
left
the
world
nothing
to
do
but
to
bore
itself
to
death
was
slowly
falling
into
disrepute
moreover
the
great
class
of
unattached
scholars
and
independent
thinkers
who
cared
as
little
for
university
dogmas
as
they
did
for
the
threats
of
the
vatican
were
earnestly
watching
for
some
new
teacher
schopenhauer
was
watching
too
he
knew
that
a
change
was
coming
and
that
he
would
come
in
with
the
change
he
had
but
to
wait
my
extreme
unction
he
said
will
be
my
baptism
my
death
a
canonization
meanwhile
old
age
had
come
upon
him
unawares
but
with
it
the
rich
fruition
of
lifelong
study
and
reflection
the
perfect
tranquility
in
which
he
passed
his
days
had
been
utilized
in
strengthening
and
expanding
his
work
and
in
in
his
year
the
second
and
complementary
volume
of
his
philosophy
was
completed
twelve
months
later
he
wrote
to
brockhaus
his
publisher
i
may
tell
you
in
confidence
that
i
am
so
well
pleased
with
this
second
volume
now
that
i
see
it
in
print
that
i
really
think
it
will
be
a
great
success
if
now
in
return
for
this
great
work
you
are
willing
to
do
me
a
very
little
favor
and
one
that
is
easily
performed
i
will
beg
you
each
easter
to
let
me
know
how
many
copies
have
been
sold
for
two
years
he
heard
nothing
then
in
answer
to
a
letter
from
him
brockhaus
wrote
in
reply
to
your
inquiry
concerning
the
sale
of
your
book
i
can
only
tell
you
that
to
my
sorrow
i
have
made
a
very
poor
business
out
of
it
further
particulars
i
can
not
enter
into
many
a
rose
schopenhauer
murmured
as
he
refolded
the
note
and
turned
to
other
things
in
when
after
six
years
daily
labor
he
had
completed
his
last
work
parerga
und
paralipomena
his
literary
reputation
was
still
so
insignificant
that
brockhaus
refused
to
publish
it
schopenhauer
then
offered
it
unavailingly
to
half
a
dozen
other
publishers
no
one
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it
the
name
which
it
bore
would
have
frightened
a
pirate
and
the
boldest
in
the
guild
was
afraid
to
examine
its
contents
one
thing
is
certain
said
schopenhauer
reflectively
i
am
unworthy
of
my
contemporaries
or
they
of
me
the
parerga
however
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
allurement
in
its
title
was
not
destined
to
wither
in
manuscript
after
much
reconnoitring
a
publisher
was
discovered
in
berlin
who
unwillingly
consented
to
produce
it
and
thereupon
two
volumes
of
the
most
original
and
entertaining
essays
were
given
to
the
public
for
this
work
schopenhauer
received
ten
copies
in
full
payment
meanwhile
a
few
adherents
had
rallied
about
him
brockhaus
in
an
attempt
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
had
marked
the
welt
down
to
the
lowest
possible
price
and
a
few
copies
had
in
consequence
fallen
into
intelligent
hands
among
its
readers
there
were
some
who
came
to
frankfort
to
make
the
author
acquaintance
a
proceeding
which
pleased
yet
alarmed
schopenhauer
not
a
little
one
of
them
wrote
to
people
with
whom
he
was
unacquainted
advising
them
to
read
the
work
at
once
he
is
a
fanatic
said
schopenhauer
in
complacent
allusion
to
him
a
fanatic
that
what
he
is
gwinner
his
subsequent
biographer
whom
he
met
about
this
time
was
his
apostle
while
frauenstadt
another
boswell
whose
acquaintance
he
made
at
he
called
his
and
not
without
pathos
repeated
to
him
byron
seductive
lines
in
the
desert
a
fountain
is
springing
in
the
white
waste
there
still
is
a
tree
and
a
bird
in
the
solitude
singing
that
speaks
to
my
spirit
of
thee
these
gentlemen
together
with
a
few
others
made
up
a
little
band
of
sturdy
disciples
who
went
about
wherever
they
could
speaking
and
writing
of
the
merits
of
schopenhauer
philosophy
but
the
first
note
of
acclamation
which
historically
speaking
was
destined
to
arouse
the
thinking
world
came
curiously
enough
from
england
in
the
westminster
review
published
a
long
and
laudatory
article
on
schopenhauer
philosophy
and
this
article
lindner
the
editor
of
the
vossiche
zeitung
to
whom
schopenhauer
had
given
the
title
of
reproduced
in
his
own
journal
in
the
following
year
frauenstadt
published
in
a
pamphlet
which
only
needed
a
little
more
order
and
symmetry
to
be
a
valuable
handbook
a
complete
exposition
of
the
doctrine
and
the
applause
thus
stimulated
reëchoed
all
over
germany
the
welt
als
wille
und
vorstellung
the
world
as
will
and
idea
which
for
so
many
years
had
lain
neglected
was
dragged
from
its
musty
shelf
like
a
raphael
from
a
and
the
fame
to
which
schopenhauer
had
not
made
a
single
step
came
to
him
as
fame
should
unsought
and
almost
unbidden
my
old
age
he
said
is
brighter
now
than
most
men
youth
for
time
has
brought
its
roses
at
last
but
see
he
added
touching
his
silvered
hair
they
are
white
from
all
sides
now
came
evidences
of
the
most
cordial
recognition
the
reviews
and
weeklies
published
anecdotes
about
him
and
extracts
from
his

at

been

attentive

decorations
were
offered
to
him

unostentatiously
refused
the
berlin
academy
within
whose
walls
hegel
had
reigned
supreme
invited
him
to
become
one
of
its
faculty
this
honor
he
also
declined
they
have
turned
their
back
on
me
all
my
life
he
said
and
after
my
death
they
want
my
name
to
adorn
their
catalogues
his
philosophy
was
lectured
upon
at
breslau
and
the
university
of
leipsic
offered
it
as
a
subject
for
a
prize
essay
all
this
was
very
pleasant
much
to
his
indignation
however
for
he
was
by
nature
greatly
disinclined
to
serve
as
pastime
to
an
idle
public
the
illustrirte

published
his
likeness
and
added
insult
to
injury
by
printing
his
name
with
two
p
ah
how
truly
has
it
been
said
that
fame
consists
in
seeing
one
name
spelt
wrong
in
the
newspapers
one
of
the
most
flattering
manifestations
of
this
sudden
vogue
was
the
curiosity
of
the
public
the
number
of
enthusiasts
that
visited
him
and
the
eagerness
with
which
artists
sought
to
preserve
his
features
for
posterity
to
all
this
concert
of
praise
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
schopenhauer
lent
a
rebellious
ear
the
success
of
his
philosophy
of
disenchantment
enchanted
him
he
accepted
with
the
seriousness
of
childhood
the
bouquets
and
sonnets
which
rained
in
upon
him
on
his
subsequent
birthdays
and
in
his
letters
to
frauenstadt
alluded
to
his
ascending
glory
with
innocent
and
amusing
satisfaction
frankfort
a
fortnight
ago
a
a
teacher
came
to
see
me
he
entered
the
room
and
looked
so
fixedly
at
me
that
i
began
to
be
frightened
and
then
he
cried
out
i
must
look
at
you
i
will
look
at
you
i
came
to
look
at
you
he
was
most
enthusiastic

he
told
me
restored
him
to
life
what
next
called
he
had
been
here
for
hours
under
an
assumed
name
and
after
many
hesitations
came
in
a
closed
carriage
to
pay
his
respects
on
taking
leave
he
kissed
my
hand
i
screamed
with
fright

saw
it
in

and
bought
it
while
it
was
still
on
the
easel
but
the
part
of
the
whole
matter
is
that
he
told
me
and
lunteschütz
too
that
he
was
going
to
build
a

on
purpose
for
it
that

every

with

wished
to

his
beautiful

for
my
forlorn
old

one
i
refused
however
he
told
me
of
a
certain

was
a
perfect
fanatic
on
the
subject
of
my
philosophy
and
who

that
emden
told

to
the
intense
surprise
that
i
had
predicted
to
him
my
future
celebrity
fully
twenty
years
ago
now
mediocrity
may
of
course
be
praised
but
as
balzac
has
put
it
it
is
never
discussed
and
schopenhauer
in
the
matter
of
discussion
came
in
for
his
full
share
he
was
praised
and
abused
by
turn
like
every
prominent
figure
he
made
a
good
mark
to
fire
at
certain
critics
said
that
he
had
stolen
from
fichte
and
schelling
everything
in
his
philosophy
that
was
worth
reading
others
abused
him
personally
and
one
writer
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
refused
to
converse
and
who
had
probably
expected
to
pay
her
hotel
bill
with
the
protocol
of
his
conversation
wrote
a
quantity
of
scurrilous
articles
about
him
but
perit
scriptum
the
criticisms
are
forgotten
while
his
work
still
endures
and
moreover
grows
each
year
into
surer
and
stronger
significance
among
his
visitors
at
the
time
was
foucher
de
carsil
and
the
portrait
which
that
gentleman
subsequently
drew
of
him
is
so
graphic
that
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
of
making
the
following
extract
when
i
first
saw
him
in
at
the
hôtel
at
frankfort
he
was
then
an
old
man
with
bright
blue
and
limpid
eyes
his
lips
were
thin
and
sarcastic
and
about
them
wandered
a
smile
of
shrewd
intelligence
his
high
forehead
was
tufted
on
either
side
with
puffs
of
white
hair
that
gave
to
his
physiognomy
luminous
as
it
was
with
wit
and
malice
a
stamp
of
nobility
and
distinction
his
garments
his
lace
his
white
cravat
reminded
me
of
that
school
of
gentlemen
who
lived
toward
the
close
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
his
manners
were
those
of
a
man
accustomed
to
the
best
society
habitually
reserved
and
timid
even
to
suspicion
he
rarely
entered
into
conversation
with
any
save
his
intimates
and
an
occasional
sympathetic
traveler
his
gestures
were
abrupt
and
in
conversation
they
became
at
once
petulant
and
suggestive
he
avoided
discussions
and
combats
in
words
but
he
did
so
that
he
might
the
better
enjoy
the
charm
of
familiar
conversation
when
he
did
speak
his
imagination
embroidered
on
the
heavy
canvas
of
the
german
tongue
the
most
subtle
and
delicate
arabesques
that
the
latin
greek
french
english
or
italian
languages
were
capable
of
suggesting
indeed
when
he
cared
to
talk
his
conversation
possessed
swing
and
precision
and
joined
thereto
was
a
wealth
of
citation
an
exactitude
of
detail
and
such
tireless
flow
of
wit
as
held
the
little
circle
of
his
friends
charmed
and
attentive
until
far
into
the
night
his
words
and
cadenced
captivated
his
listener
wholly
they
both
pictured
and
analyzed
a
tremulous
sensitiveness
heightened
their
fervor
they
were
precise
and
exact
on
every
topic
a
german
who
had
traveled
extensively
in
abyssinia
was
so
astonished
at
the
minute
details
which
he
gave
on
the
different
species
of
crocodiles
and
their
customs
that
he
thought
that
in
him
he
recognized
a
former
companion
happy
are
they
who
heard
this
last
survivor
of
the
conversationalists
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
was
a
contemporary
of
voltaire
and
of
diderot
of
helvetius
and
of
chamfort
his
brilliant
thoughts
on
women
on
the
part
that
mothers
hold
in
the
intellectual
qualities
of
their
children
his
theories
profoundly
original
on
the
connection
between
will
and
mind
his
views
on
art
and
nature
on
the
life
and
death
of
the
species
his
remarks
on
the
dull
and
wearisome
style
of
those
who
write
to
say
nothing
or
who
put
on
a
mask
and
think
with
the
thoughts
of
others
his
pungent
reflections
on
the
subject
of
pseudonyms
and
on
the
establishment
of
a
literary
censure
for
those
journals
which
permitted
neologisms
solecisms
and
barbarisms
his
ingenious
hypotheses
on
magnetic
phenomena
dreams
and
somnambulism
his
hatred
of
excess
of
every
kind
his
love
of
order
and
his
horror
of
obscurantism
pas
un
péché
contre
le
saint
esprit
en
est
un
contre
humain
make
for
him
a
physiognomy
entirely
different
from
any
other
of
this
century
a
few
tags
and
tatters
of
these
conversations
have
been
preserved
by
frauenstadt
and
in
them
schopenhauer
is
discovered
sprawled
at
ease
and
expressing
himself
on
a
variety
of
topics
with
a
and
freedom
of
epithet
which
recalls
the
earlier
essayists
with
them
as
with
him
periphrasis
was
avoided
spades
were
spades
not
horticultural
implements
and
in
one
dialogue
frauenstadt
compliments
his
master
in
having
in
breadth
and
reach
of
his
polemic
nothing
in
common
with
contemporary
regard
for
ears
polite
citations
of
this
class
however
may
well
be
omitted
a
thinker
in
slippers
and
especially
puris
is
generally
unattractive
even
to
those
the
least
given
to
prudishness
but
beyond
certain
instances
of
this
description
the
scholar
and
man
of
the
world
is
usually
very
discernible
at
times
he
is
profound
at
others
vivacious
for
instance
he
is
asked
what
man
would
be
if
nature
in
making
the
last
step
which
leads
to
him
had
started
from
the
dog
or
the
elephant
to
which
he
answers
in
that
case
man
would
be
an
intelligent
dog
or
an
intelligent
elephant
instead
of
being
an
intelligent
monkey
as
may
be
imagined
there
was
about
schopenhauer
very
little
of
the
theologian
and
religion
was
in
consequence
seldom
viewed
by
him
from
an
orthodox
standpoint
when
therefore
schleiermacher
was
quoted
before
him
to
the
effect
that
no
man
can
be
a
philosopher
who
is
not
religious
he
observed
very
quietly
no
man
who
is
religious
can
become
a
philosopher
metaphysics
are
useless
to
him
and
no
true
philosopher
is
religious
he
is
sometimes
in
danger
but
he
is
not
fettered
he
is
free
elsewhere
he
said
religion
and
philosophy
are
like
the
two
scales
of
a
balance
the
more
one
rises
the
more
does
the
other
descend
in
schopenhauer
opinion
the
greatest
novels
were
tristram
shandy
wilhelm
meister
don
quixote
and
the
nouvelle
héloïse
to
don
quixote
he
ascribed
an
allegorical
meaning
but
as
an
intellectual
romance
he
preferred
wilhelm
meister
to
all
others
he
believed
in
clairvoyance
but
not
that
man
is
a
free
agent
and
it
may
be
here
noted
that
according
to
the
most
recent
scientific
opinion
man
is
a
free
agent
about
once
in
hours
everything
that
happens
happens
necessarily
he
would
say
and
it
was
with
this
maxim
of
whose
truth
he
had
a
variety
of
examples
and
with
the
aid
of
the
theory
of
the
ideality
of
time
that
he
explained
second
sight
everything
is
now
that
is
to
be
he
said
but
with
our
ordinary
eyes
we
do
not
see
it
the
clairvoyant
merely
puts
on
the
spectacles
of
time
in
the
paränesen
und
maximen
in
which
schopenhauer
chats
quietly
with
the
reader
and
not
with
the
disciple
many
quaint
and
forcible
suggestions
are
to
be
found
for
instance
among
other
things
he
says
i
accord
my
entire
respect
to
any
man
who
when
unoccupied
and
waiting
for
something
does
not
immediately
begin
to
beat
a
tattoo
with
his
fingers
or
toy
with
the
object
nearest
his
hand
it
is
probable
that
such
a
man
has
thoughts
of
his
own
his
advice
too
on
the
manner
in
which
we
should
think
and
work
is
quite
emersonian
in
its
directness
it
was
it
may
be
added
the
manner
in
which
he
thought
and
worked
himself
have
compartments
for
your
thoughts
and
open
but
one
of
them
at
a
time
in
this
way
each
little
pleasure
you
may
have
will
not
be
spoiled
by
some
lumbering
care
neither
will
one
thought
drive
out
another
and
an
important
matter
will
not
swamp
a
lot
of
smaller
ones
such
vaguely
outlined
was
this
great
and
interesting
figure
with
the
appearance
of
the
parerga
his
work
was
done
he
lived
ten
years
longer
in
great
seclusion
receiving
only
infrequent
visits
there
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
he
would
say
and
suggested
that
his
friends
and
believers
should
meet
and
consult
without
him
such
literary
labor
as
he
then
performed
consisted
mainly
in
strengthening
that
which
he
had
already
written
and
in
making
notes
and
suggestions
for
future
editions
at
the
age
of
he
died
very
peacefully
though
suddenly
leaving
all
his
fortune
to
charitable
purposes
in
these
pages
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
enter
into
the
details
of
biography
for
that
pleasant
task
has
been
already
well
performed
by
other
and
better
equipped
pens
the
present
writer
has
therefore
only
sought
to
present
such
a
view
of
schopenhauer
as
might
aid
the
general
reader
to
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
doctrine
which
he
was
the
first
to
present
and
which
will
be
briefly
considered

the

riddle
in

beer
halls
when
one
student
is
heard
laying
down
the
law
about
something
which
he
does
not
understand
to
a
companion
who
cares
not
a
rap
on
the
subject
it
is
very
generally
taken
for
granted
that
the
two
are
talking
metaphysics
indeed
metaphysics
has
a
bad
name
everywhere
in
itself
it
suggests
nothing
very
enticing
and
even
its
nomenclature
seems
to
bring
with
it
a
sort
of
ponderosity
which
is
very
nearly
akin
to
the
repulsive
this
prejudice
of
course
is
not
without
its
reason
the
philosophers
nearly
one
and
all
seem
to
have
banded
themselves
into
a
sort
of
imaginary
freemasonry
whose
portals
they
bar
to
any
one
refusing
to
robe
his
thoughts
in
a
garment
of
technical
speech
moreover
at
the
very
gateway
of
their
guild
there
looms
before
the
timorous
the
fear
of
a
hideous
initiation
the
cold
douche
of
logic
and
the
memorizing
of
hateful
terms
there
can
therefore
be
no
stronger
proof
of
schopenhauer
ability
than
that
which
is
contained
in
the
fact
that
he
successfully
eluded
all
these
stale
abuses
and
turned
one
of
the
heaviest
kinds
of
writing
into
one
of
the
most
agreeable
indeed
schopenhauer
is
not
only
one
of
the
most
profound
thinkers
of
the
essentially
profound
nineteenth
century
but
what
is
still
more
noteworthy
he
is
an
exceptionably
fascinating
teacher
his
spacious
theories
and
tangential
flights
are
of
course
not
such
as
charm
the
reader
of
the
penny
dreadful
but
any
one
who
is
interested
in
the
drama
of
evolution
and
the
of
life
will
it
is
believed
find
in
him
a
fund
of
curious
information
such
as
no
other
thinker
has
had
the
power
to
convey
he
has
it
is
true
made
the
most
of
the
worst
but
beyond
this
reproach
but
one
other
of
serious
import
remains
to
be
brought
against
him
and
that
is
that
though
he
has
been
dead
and
buried
for
very
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
is
still
on
the
outer
margin
of
his
epoch
for
this
he
is
not
of
course
entirely
to
blame
there
are
among
thinkers
many
pleasant
optimists
still
who
form
a
respectable
majority
to
be
sure
a
wise
man
once
said
that
in
considering
a
new
subject
the
minority
were
always
right
but
disregarding
for
the
moment
the
fallacy
of
believing
that
this
world
is
the
best
one
possible
it
can
not
but
be
admitted
that
scientific
pessimism
is
still
in
its
infancy
it
has
yet
many
prejudices
to
disarm
and
many
errors
of
its
own
to
correct
like
meaner
things
it
must
mature
for
this
it
has
ample
time
berkeley
says
that
few
men
think
yet
all
have
opinions
and
it
is
now
very
frequently
asserted
that
when
more
is
thought
not
only
there
will
not
be
such
a
diversity
of
opinion
but
at
that
time
pessimism
as
the
religion
of
the
future
will
begin
its
sway
it
has
been
elsewhere
noted
that
the
effect
of
kant
philosophy
was
not
dissimilar
to
that
of
a
successful
operation
on
cataract
and
the
aim
of
the
world
as
will
and
idea
is
to
place
in
the
hands
of
those
on
whom
that
operation
has
been
satisfactorily
performed
a
pair
of
such
spectacles
as
are
suitable
to
convalescent
eyes
schopenhauer
is
therefore
in
a
measure
indebted
to
kant
as
also
it
may
be
added
to
plato
and
the
sacred
books
of
the
hindus
in
saying
however
that
schopenhauer
is
indebted
to
kant
it
is
well
to
point
out
that
schopenhauer
begins
precisely
where
kant
left
off
kant
great
merit
consisted
in
distinguishing
the
phenomenon
from
the
or
in
other
words
in
showing
the
difference
between
that
which
seems
and
that
which
is
for
the
inaccessible
he
had
no
explanation
to
offer
he
called
it
the
an
regarded
it
as
the
result
of
an
unintelligible
cause
and
then
left
it
to
be
a
bugbear
to
every
student
of
his
philosophy
this
unpleasant
an
was
exorcised
and
banished
for
good
and
all
by
fichte
and
hegel
but
schopenhauer
reëstablished
the
incomprehensible
factor
on
a
fresh
basis
christened
it
will
and
asserted
it
to
be
the
creator
of
all
that
is
and
at
once
independent
free
and
omnipotent
in
other
words
the
interior
essence
of
the
world
of
which
christ
crucified
is
the
sublime
symbol
thus
disposed
of
the
an
may
now
be
left
to
take
care
of
itself
and
the
examination
of
the
great
theory
begun
schopenhauer
opens
his
philosophy
with
the
formula
the
world
is
my
idea
a
formula
which
it
may
be
noted
condenses
in
the
fewest
possible
words
all
that
is
worth
condensing
of
the
idealism
of
germany
beginning
in
this
manner
it
is
evident
that
he
proposes
to
show
neither
whence
the
world
comes
nor
whither
it
tends
nor
yet
why
it
is
but
simply
it
the
question
has
been
asked
before
according
to
schopenhauer
the
world
is
made
up
of
two
zones
the
real
and
the
ideal
and
it
may
here
be
said
that
over
the
real
and
the
ideal
schopenhauer
successfully
read
the
banns
to
return
however
to
the
opening
formula
the
world
is
my
idea
is
a
truth
which
holds
good
for
everything
that
lives
and
thinks
but
which
however
is
appreciable
only
by
man
when
appreciated
it
is
at
once
clear
that
what
we
know
is
neither
a
sun
nor
an
earth
for
we
have
at
best
an
eye
which
sees
the
one
and
a
hand
which
feels
the
other
in
brief
we
are
unacquainted
with
either
forms
or
colors
we
have
but
senses
which
represent
them
to
us
while
objects
exist
for
us
merely
through
the
medium
of
the
intelligence
indeed
as
schopenhauer
has
said
no
other
truth
is
more
certain
and
less
in
need
of
proof
than
this
that
the
whole
world
is
simply
the
perception
of
a
perceiver
in
a
word
idea
emerson
says
that
the
frivolous
make
themselves
merry
with
this
theory
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
at
first
it
does
not
seem
quite
satisfactory
to
be
told
that
the
world
in
which
we
live
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
cerebral
phenomenon
which
man
carries
with
him
to
the
tomb
and
which
in
the
absence
of
a
perceiver
would
not
exist
at
all
to
arrive
however
at
a
clear
understanding
of
the
purely
phenomenal
existence
of
the
exterior
world
it
will
suffice
to
represent
to
self
the
world
as
it
was
when
entirely
uninhabited
at
that
time
it
was
necessarily
without
perception
later
there
sprang
up
a
great
quantity
of
plants
upon
which
the
different
forces
of
light
air
humidity
and
electricity
acted
according
to
their
nature
if
now
it
be
remembered
how
impressionable
plants
are
to
these
agents
and
how
thought
leads
by
degrees
to
sensation
and
thence
to
perception
immediately
then
the
world
appears
representing
itself
in
time
and
space
or
reverse
the
argument
and
imagine
that
the
dream
of
the
poet
is
realized
that
nations
have
disappeared
and
that
every
living
thing
has
ceased
to
be
while
beneath
the
sun
unchanging
stare
and
enveloped
in
the
bland
pervasive
blue
the
earth
with
her
continents
and
archipelagoes
continues
to
revolve
in
space
under
such
circumstances
it
would
naturally
seem
as
though
the
universe
subsisted
still
but
if
the
question
is
examined
more
closely
it
will
perhaps
be
admitted
that
these
things
remain
as
they
are
only
on
condition
of
being
seen
and
felt
for
supposing
one
spectator
present
but
of
a
different
mental
organization
from
our
own
then
the
entire
scene
is
changed
suppress
him
and
the
whole
spectacle
tumbles
into
chaos
this
doctrine
as
it
will
be
readily
understood
does
not
in
any
sense
deny
the
reality
of
the
world
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
it
maintains
merely
that
every
object
is
conditioned
by
its
subject
or
to
explain
the
theory
less
technically
it
will
be
sufficient
to
reflect
that
for
the
world
or
for
anything
else
to
be
an
object
there
must
be
some
one
as
subject
to
think
it
for
instance
the
dreamless
sleep
proves
that
the
earth
exists
only
to
the
thinking
mind
and
should
all
nature
be
rocked
in
an
eternal
slumber
there
could
then
be
no
question
of
an
exterior
world
if
it
be
asked
in
what
this
perception
consists
which
represents
the
exterior
world
we
find
that
it
is
limited
to
three
fundamental
concepts
that
of
time
space
and
their
concomitant
causality
but
inasmuch
as
time
and
space
are
the
receptacle
of
every
phenomenon
once
their
ideality
is
established
the
ideality
of
the
world
is
proven
at
the
same
moment
and
with
it
the
truth
of
the
formula
the
world
is
my
idea
now
the
ideality
of
time
is
established
according
to
schopenhauer
by
what
is
known
in
mechanics
as
the
law
of
inertia
for
what
he
asks
in
the
parerga
does
this
law
teach
simply
that
time
alone
can
not
produce
any
physical
action
that
alone
and
in
itself
it
alters
nothing
either
in
the
repose
or
movement
of
a
body
were
it
either
accidentally
or
otherwise
inherent
in
things
themselves
it
would
follow
that
its
duration
or
brevity
would
affect
them
in
a
certain
measure
but
it
does
nothing
of
the
sort
time
passes
over
all
things
without
leaving
the
slightest
trace
for
they
are
acted
upon
only
by
the
causes
that
unroll
themselves
time
but
in
no
sense
by
time
itself
when
therefore
a
body
is
withdrawn
from
chemical
action
as
the
mammoth
in
the
ice
fields
the
fly
in
amber
and
the
egyptian
antiquities
in
their
closed
necropoli
thousands
of
years
may
pass
and
leave
them
unaffected
indeed
he
adds
elsewhere
the
living
toads
found
in
limestone
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
even
animal
life
may
be
suspended
for
thousands
of
years
provided
this
suspension
is
begun
in
the
dormant
period
and
maintained
by
special
circumstances
the
london
times
september
contains
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
at
a
lecture
delivered
by
pettigrew
at
the
literary
and
scientific
institute
the
lecturer
showed
some
grains
of
wheat
which
sir
wilkenson
had
found
in
a
grave
at
thebes
where
they
must
have
lain
for
three
thousand
years
they
were
found
in
an
hermetically
sealed
vase
pettigrew
had
sowed
twelve
grains
and
obtained
a
plant
which
grew
five
feet
high
and
the
seeds
of
which
were
then
quite
ripe
many
other
instances
are
given
of
this
absolute
inactivity
for
example
let
a
body
once
be
put
in
motion
that
motion
is
never
arrested
or
diminished
by
any
lapse
of
time
it
would
be
never
ending
were
it
not
for
the
reaction
of
physical
causes
in
the
same
manner
a
body
in
repose
would
remain
so
eternally
did
not
physical
causes
put
it
in
motion
it
follows
therefore
that
time
is
not
a
real
existence
but
only
a
condition
of
thought
or
purely
ideal
in
regard
to
the
ideality
of
space
schopenhauer
says
the
clearest
and
most
simple
proof
of
the
ideality
of
space
is
that
we
can
never
get
it
out
of
our
thoughts
as
we
might
anything
else
we
can
fancy
space
as
having
no
longer
anything
to
fill
it
we
can
imagine
that
everything
within
it
has
disappeared
we
can
represent
it
as
being
between
the
fixed
stars
an
absolute
void
but
space
itself
we
can
never
get
rid
of
whatever
we
do
however
we
turn
there
it
is
in
endless
expansion
this
fact
certainly
proves
that
space
is
a
part
of
our
intellect
or
in
other
words
that
it
is
the
woof
of
the
tissue
upon
which
the
different
objects
of
the
exterior
world
apply
themselves
as
soon
as
i
think
of
an
object
space
appears
with
it
and
accompanies
every
movement
every
turn
and
of
my
thought
as
faithfully
as
the
spectacles
on
my
nose
accompany
every
movement
every
turn
and
of
my
person
or
just
in
the
same
manner
as
the
shadow
accompanies
the
body
if
i
notice
that
a
thing
accompanies
me
everywhere
and
under
all
circumstances
i
naturally
conclude
that
it
is
in
some
way
connected
with
me
as
if
for
instance
wherever
i
went
i
noticed
a
particular
odor
from
which
i
could
not
escape
space
is
precisely
the
same
whatever
i
think
of
what
ever
i
imagine
space
comes
first
and
yields
its
place
to
nothing
it
must
therefore
be
an
integral
part
of
my
understanding
and
its
ideality
in
consequence
must
extend
to
everything
that
is
thinkable
space
and
time
being
but
the
empty
framework
of
phenomenal
existence
something
must
fill
them
and
that
something
is
causality
which
according
to
schopenhauer
is
synonymous
with
action
and
matter
into
these
abstract
regions
however
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
him
any
further
suffice
it
to
say
that
having
shown
in
this
way
that
one
of
the
two
zones
of
which
the
world
is
formed
is
but
an
effect
of
the
perceptions
he
passes
therefrom
to
the
world
as
it
is
now
there
were
many
paths
which
might
or
might
not
have
led
him
to
the
unravelment
of
the
great
secret
which
kant
gave
up
in
despair
there
were
many
ways
which
seemed
to
tend
to
a
direct
solution
of
the
sphinx
riddle
but
the
course
which
he
chose
and
which
brought
him
nearer
to
the
proper
answer
than
any
other
system
of
which
the
world
yet
knows
may
be
fairly
said
to
have
been
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
truth
and
as
an
inspiration
given
first
to
him
of
all
men
it
was
not
mathematics
that
he
selected
to
aid
him
in
his
search
for
the
real
for
whatever
the
subtleties
of
that
science
may
be
it
is
still
too
superficial
to
contain
an
explorable
depth
the
natural
sciences
could
aid
him
as
little
anatomy
botany
and
zoölogy
reveal
it
is
true
an
infinite
variety
of
forms
but
these
forms
at
best
are
but
unrelated
perceptions
a
series
of
indecipherable
hieroglyphics
even
etiology
when
embracing
the
whole
range
of
physical
science
gives
at
most
but
the
nomenclature
succession
and
changes
of
inexplicable
forces
without
revealing
anything
of
their
inner
nature
all
these
methods
were
smitten
with
the
same
defect
they
were
all
external
and
offered
not
the
essence
of
things
but
only
their
image
and
description
to
employ
them
therefore
in
a
search
for
truth
would
he
said
be
on
a
par
with
a
man
who
wandering
about
a
castle
looking
vainly
for
the
entrance
takes
meanwhile
a
sketch
of
the
façade
such
however
he
noted
is
the
method
which
all
other
philosophers
have
followed
he
concluded
therefore
as
man
was
not
only
a
thinking
being
to
whom
the
world
was
merely
an
idea
but
an
individual
riveted
to
the
earth
by
a
body
whose
affections
were
the
of
his
intuitions
that
reality
would
come
to
him
not
from
without
but
from
within
for
this
body
of
man
is
he
argued
but
an
object
among
other
objects
its
movements
and
actions
are
unknown
to
the
thinking
being
save
as
are
the
changes
of
the
others
and
they
would
be
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
his
own
were
not
their
signification
revealed
to
him
in
another
manner
he
would
see
movements
follow
motives
with
the
constancy
of
a
natural
law
and
would
as
little
understand
the
influence
of
the
motive
as
the
connection
of
any
other
effect
with
its
cause
he
could
if
he
chose
call
it
force
quality
or
character
but
that
is
all
that
he
would
know
about
it
what
then
is
the
interior
essence
of
every
manifestation
and
of
every
action
what
is
that
which
is
identical
with
the
body
to
such
an
extent
that
to
its
command
a
movement
always
answers
what
is
that
with
which
nature
plays
which
works
dumbly
in
the
rock
slumbers
in
the
plant
and
awakes
in
man
schopenhauer
answers
with
a
word
will
will
he
teaches
is
a
force
and
should
not
be
taken
as
it
is
ordinarily
to
mean
simply
the
conscious
act
of
an
intelligent
being
in
nature
it
is
a
blind
unconscious
power
in
man
it
is
the
foundation
of
being
but
before
entering
into
an
examination
of
the
functions
and
vagaries
of
this
force
of
which
everything
from
a
cataclysm
to
a
blade
of
grass
is
a
derivative
it
is
well
to
inquire
what
its
exact
rank
is
it
has
been
already
said
that
in
man
it
was
the
foundation
of
being
but
from
very
early
times
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
the
days
in
which
anaxagoras
lived
and
taught
the
intellect
has
held
among
all
man
other
attributes
a
sceptre
hitherto
uncontested
if
schopenhauer
however
is
to
be
believed
the
supremacy
hitherto
accorded
to
it
has
been
the
result
of
error
the
throne
by
grace
divine
belongs
to
will
the
intellect
is
but
the
prime
minister
the
instrument
of
a
higher
force
as
the
hammer
is
that
of
the
smith
if
the
matter
be
examined
however
casually
it
will
become
at
once
clear
that
what
we
are
most
conscious
of
in
effort
hope
desire
fear
love
hatred
and
determination
are
the
workings
and
manifestations
of
will
if
the
animal
is
considered
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
descending
scale
intelligence
becomes
more
and
more
imperfect
while
will
remains
entirely
unaffected
the
smallest
insect
wants
what
it
wants
as
much
as
man
the
intellect
moreover
becomes
wearied
while
will
is
indefatigable
indeed
when
it
is
remembered
that
such
men
as
swift
kant
scott
southey
rousseau
and
emerson
have
fallen
into
a
state
of
intellectual
debility
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
the
mind
is
but
a
function
of
the
body
which
in
turn
is
a
function
of
the
will
but
that
which
probably
shows
the
secondary
and
dependent
nature
of
the
intelligence
more
clearly
is
its
peculiar
characteristic
of
intermittence
and
periodicity
in
deep
sleep
the
brain
rests
while
the
other
organs
continue
their
work
in
brief
then
intellect
is
the
light
and
will
the
warmth
in
me
schopenhauer
says
the
indestructible
is
not
the
soul
but
rather
to
employ
a
chemical
term
the
basis
of
the
soul
which
is
will
will
moreover
is
not
only
the
foundation
of
being
but
as
has
been
noted
it
is
the
universal
essence
schopenhauer
points
out
the
ascension
of
sap
in
plants
which
is
no
easy
problem
in
hydraulics
and
the
insect
marvelous
anticipations
of
the
future
and
asks
what
is
it
all
but
will
the
vital
force
itself
he
says
is
will
will
to
live
while
the
organism
of
the
body
is
but
will
manifested
will
become
visible
as
schopenhauer
describes
it
will
is
also
identical
immutable
and
free
its
identity
is
shown
in
inorganic
life
in
the
irresistible
of
water
to
precipitate
itself
into
cavities
the
with
which
the
loadstone
turns
to
the
north
the
that
iron
has
to
attach
itself
to
it
the
violence
with
which
contrary
currents
of
electricity
to
unite
the
of
fluids
and
in
the
manner
in
which
they
join
and
separate
in
organic
life
it
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
every
vegetable
has
a
peculiar
characteristic
one
wants
a
damp
soil
another
needs
a
dry
one
one
grows
only
on
high
ground
another
in
the
valley
one
turns
to
the
light
another
to
the
water
while
the
climbing
plant
seeks
a
support
in
the
animal
kingdom
there
exists
another
form
which
is
noticeable
in
the
partly
voluntary
partly
involuntary
movements
of
the
lowest
type
when
however
in
the
evolution
of
will
the
insect
or
the
animal
seeks
and
chooses
its
food
then
intelligence
begins
and
volition
passes
from
darkness
into
light
will
too
is
immutable
it
never
varies
it
is
the
same
in
man
as
in
the
caterpillar
for
as
has
been
said
what
an
insect
wants
it
wants
as
decidedly
as
does
a
man
the
only
difference
is
in
the
object
of
desire
the
immutability
of
will
moreover
is
the
base
of
its
indestructibility
it
never
perishes
and
for
that
matter
what
does
in
the
world
of
phenomena
all
things
it
is
true
seem
to
have
a
birth
and
a
death
but
that
is
but
an
illusion
which
the
philosopher
does
not
share
our
true
being
and
the
veritable
essence
of
all
things
dwell
schopenhauer
says
in
a
region
where
time
is
not
and
where
the
concepts
of
birth
and
death
are
without
significance
the
fear
of
death
he
adds
parenthetically
is
a
purely
independent
sentiment
and
one
which
has
its
origin
in
the
will
to
live
briefly
it
is
an
illusion
which
man
brings
with
him
when
he
is
born
and
which
guides
him
through
life
for
notice
that
were
this
fear
of
death
perfectly
reasonable
man
would
be
as
uneasy
about
the
chaos
which
preceded
his
existence
as
about
that
which
is
to
follow
it
let
the
individual
die
however
the
species
is
indestructible
for
death
is
to
the
species
as
sleep
is
to
the
individual
the
species
contains
the
indestructible
the
immutable
will
of
which
the
individual
is
a
manifestation
it
contains
all
that
is
all
that
was
and
all
that
will
be
when
we
think
of
the
future
and
of
the
coming
generations
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
will
differ
from
us
in
habits
and
customs
and
we
try
in
imagination
to
fancy
them
with
us
we
wonder
from
where
they
will
spring
where
they
are
now
where
is
this
fecund
chaos
rich
in
worlds
that
hides
the
generations
that
are
to
be
and
where
can
it
be
save
there
where
every
reality
has
been
and
will
be
here
in
the
present
and
what
it
contains
and
you
foolish
questioner
who
do
not
recognize
your
own
essence
you
are
like
the
leaf
on
the
tree
which
withering
in
autumn
and
feeling
it
is
about
to
fall
laments
at
death
inconsolable
at
the
knowledge
of
the
fresh
verdure
which
in
spring
will
cover
the
tree
once
more
the
leaf
cries
am
no
more
foolish
leaf
where
do
you
go
whence
do
the
fresh
leaves
come
where
is
this
chaos
whose
gulf
you
fear
see
your
own
self
is
in
that
force
interior
and
hidden
acting
on
the
tree
which
through
all
generations
of
leaves
knows
neither
birth
nor
death
and
now
tell
me
schopenhauer
concludes
as
though
he
were
about
to
pronounce
a
benediction
tell
me
is
man
unlike
the
leaf
this
doctrine
which
teaches
that
through
all
there
is
one
invariable
identical
and
equal
force
is
the
great
problem
whose
solution
was
sought
by
kant
and
which
he
gave
up
in
despair
it
is
the
discovery
which
makes
of
schopenhauer
one
of
the
foremost
thinkers
of
the
century
and
one
it
may
be
added
without
any
unguarded
enthusiasm
which
will
suffice
to
carry
his
name
into
other
ages
somewhat
in
the
same
manner
as
the
name
of
columbus
has
descended
to
us
if
we
were
to
consider
he
said
the
nature
of
this
force
which
admittedly
moves
the
world
but
whose
psychological
examination
is
so
little
advanced
that
the
most
certain
analytical
results
seem
not
unlike
a
paradox
we
should
be
astonished
at
this
fundamental
verity
which
i
have
been
the
first
to
bring
to
light
and
to
which
i
have
given
its
true
name
will
for
what
is
the
world
but
an
enormous
will
constantly
irrupting
into
life
gravitation
electricity
heat
every
form
of
activity
from
the
fall
of
an
apple
to
the
foundation
of
a
republic
is
but
the
expression
of
will
and
nothing
more
this
doctrine
of
volition
coincides
it
may
be
noted
very
perfectly
with
that
of
evolution
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
schopenhauer
to
show
that
the
more
recent
results
of
science
were
a
confirmation
of
his
philosophy
in
the
parerga
which
he
wrote
thirty
years
after
the
publication
of
his
chief
work
he
says
that
during
the
early
stages
of
the
globe
formation
before
the
age
of
granite
the
objectivity
of
the
was
limited
to
the
most
inferior
forms
also
that
the
forces
were
at
that
time
engaged
in
a
combat
whose
theatre
was
not
alone
the
surface
of
the
globe
but
its
entire
mass
a
combat
too
colossal
for
the
imagination
to
grasp
when
this
titan
conflict
of
chemical
forces
had
ended
and
the
granite
like
a
tombstone
covered
the
combatants
the
by
a
striking
contrast
irrupted
in
the
peaceful
world
of
plant
and
forest
this
vegetable
world
decarbonized
the
air
and
prepared
it
for
animal
life
the
objectivity
of
will
then
realized
a
new
form
the
animal
kingdom
fish
and
crustaceans
filled
the
sea
gigantic
reptiles
covered
the
earth
and
gradually
through
innumerable
forms
each
more
perfect
than
the
last
the
ascended
finally
to
man
this
stage
attained
is
in
his
opinion
destined
to
be
the
last
for
with
it
is
come
the
possibility
of
the
denial
of
the
will
through
which
the
divine
comedy
will
end
this
possibility
of
the
denial
of
the
will
and
the
ransom
of
the
world
from
its
attendant
misery
thereby
will
be
explained
later
on
and
for
the
moment
it
will
be
sufficient
to
note
that
schopenhauer
refused
to
admit
that
a
being
more
intelligent
than
man
could
exist
either
here
or
on
any
other
planet
for
with
enlarged
intelligence
he
would
consider
life
too
deplorable
to
be
supported
for
a
single
moment
if
now
the
foregoing
arguments
are
admitted
and
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
hemispheres
one
apparent
and
one
real
one
the
world
of
perceptions
and
one
the
world
of
will
there
must
necessarily
be
some
connection
between
the
two
some
point
at
which
they
meet
and
join
this
chasm
schopenhauer
lightly
bridges
over
with
those
ideas
of
plato
which
the
middle
ages
neglected
and
which
formed
the
banquet
and
the
sustenance
of
the
renaissance
in
fact
the
eternal
yet
ever
fresh
suggestions
that
nature
offers
to
the
artist
and
which
the
sculptor
with
his
chisel
the
poet
with
his
pen
the
painter
with
his
brush
resuscitate
and
explain
anew
it
is
however
only
in
the
purest
contemplation
that
these
suggestions
can
be
properly
received
and
it
is
of
course
in
genius
that
a
preëminent
capacity
for
such
receptivity
exists
for
it
is
as
if
when
genius
appears
in
an
individual
a
larger
measure
of
the
power
of
knowledge
falls
to
his
lot
than
is
necessary
for
the
service
of
an
individual
will
and
this
superfluity
being
free
becomes
as
it
were
the
mirror
of
the
inner
nature
of
the
world
or
as
carlyle
puts
it
the
spiritual
picture
of
nature
this
schopenhauer
notes
parenthetically
explains
the
restless
activity
of
the
genius
for
the
present
can
rarely
satisfy
him
because
it
does
not
fill
his
thoughts
there
is
in
him
a
ceaseless
aspiration
and
desire
for
new
and
lofty
things
and
a
longing
to
meet
and
communicate
with
others
of
similar
status
the
common
mortal
on
the
other
hand
filled
with
the
hour
ends
in
it
and
finding
everywhere
his
like
enjoys
that
satisfaction
in
daily
life
from
which
the
genius
is
debarred
the
common
mortal
the
as
it
is
the
fashion
to
call
him
turned
out
as
he
is
daily
by
the
thousand
manufactured
it
would
seem
to
order
finds
in
his
satisfied
mediocrity
no
glimmer
even
of
a
spark
that
can
predispose
him
to
disinterested
observation
whatever
arrests
his
attention
does
so
only
for
the
moment
and
in
all
that
appears
before
him
he
seeks
merely
the
general
concept
under
which
it
is
to
be
brought
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
the
indolent
seek
a
chair
which
then
interests
them
no
further
and
yet
it
is
unnecessary
to
pore
over
german
metaphysics
to
know
that
whoso
can
lose
himself
in
nature
and
sink
his
own
individuality
therein
finds
that
it
has
suddenly
become
a
suggestion
which
he
has
absorbed
and
which
is
now
part
of
himself
it
is
in
this
sense
that
byron
says
are
not
the
mountains
waves
and
skies
a
part
of
me
and
of
my
soul
as
i
of
them
this
theory
it
is
true
is
not
that
of
all
great
poets
many
of
whom
as
witness
shelley
and
leopardi
did
not
see
in
the
splendid
face
of
nature
that
they
could
not
be
absolutely
perishable
and
so
selfishly
mourned
over
their
own
weakness
and
her
impassibility
according
to
schopenhauer
art
should
be
strictly
impersonal
and
contemplation
as
calm
as
a
foretaste
of
nirvâna
in
which
the
individual
is
effaced
and
only
the
pure
knowing
subject
subsists
this
condition
he
praises
with
great
wealth
of
adjective
as
the
painless
state
which
epicurus
of
refined
memory
celebrated
as
the
highest
good
the
bliss
of
the
gods
for
therein
man
is
freed
from
the
hateful
yoke
of
will
the
penal
servitude
of
daily
life
ceases
as
for
a
sabbath
the
wheel
of
ixion
stands
still
the
cause
of
all
this
he
is
at
no
loss
to
explain
and
he
does
so
it
may
be
added
in
a
manner
poetically
logical
and
peculiar
to
himself
every
desire
is
born
of
a
need
of
a
privation
or
a
suffering
when
satisfied
it
is
lulled
but
for
one
that
is
satisfied
how
many
are
unappeased
desire
moreover
is
of
long
duration
its
exigencies
are
infinite
while
pleasure
is
brief
and
narrowly
measured
even
this
pleasure
is
only
an
apparition
another
succeeds
it
the
first
is
a
vanished
illusion
the
second
an
illusion
which
lingers
still
nothing
is
capable
of
appeasing
will
nor
of
permanently
arresting
it
the
best
we
can
do
for
ourselves
is
like
the
alms
tossed
to
a
beggar
which
in
preserving
his
life
prolongs
his
misery
while
therefore
we
are
dominated
by
desires
and
ruled
by
will
so
long
as
we
give
ourselves
up
to
hopes
that
delude
and
fears
that
persecute
we
have
neither
repose
nor
happiness
but
when
an
accident
an
interior
harmony
lifting
us
for
the
time
from
out
the
infinite
torrent
of
desire
delivers
the
spirit
from
the
oppression
of
the
will
turns
our
attention
from
everything
that
solicits
it
and
all
things
seem
as
freed
from
the
allurements
of
hope
and
personal
interest
then
repose
vainly
pursued
yet
ever
intangible
comes
to
us
of
itself
bearing
with
open
hands
the
plenitude
of
the
gift
of
peace
the
fine
arts
therefore
as
well
as
philosophy
are
at
work
on
the
problem
of
existence
every
mind
that
has
once
rested
in
impersonal
contemplation
of
the
world
tends
from
that
moment
to
some
comprehension
of
the
mystery
of
beauty
and
the
internal
essence
of
all
things
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
every
new
work
which
grapples
forcibly
with
any
actuality
is
one
more
answer
to
the
question
what
is
life
to
this
query
every
masterpiece
replies
pertinently
but
in
its
own
manner
art
which
speaks
in
the
ingenuous
tongue
of
intuition
and
not
in
the
abstract
speech
of
thought
answers
the
question
with
a
passing
image
but
not
with
a
definite
reply
but
every
great
work
be
it
a
poem
a
picture
a
statue
or
a
play
answers
still
even
music
replies
and
more
profoundly
than
anything
else
indeed
art
offers
to
him
who
questions
an
image
born
of
intuition
which
says
see
this
is
life
briefly
then
contemplation
brings
with
it
that
affranchisement
of
the
intelligence
which
is
not
alone
a
release
from
the
trammels
of
the
will
but
which
is
the
law
of
art
itself
and
raises
man
out
of
misery
into
the
pure
world
of
ideas
in
the
treatment
of
this
subject
which
in
the
hands
of
other
writers
has
been
productive
of
inexpressible
weariness
schopenhauer
has
given
himself
no
airs
in
what
has
gone
before
there
has
been
it
must
be
admitted
no
attempt
to
narrate
history
and
then
pass
it
off
as
an
explanation
of
the
universe
he
has
gone
to
the
root
of
the
matter
seized
a
fact
and
brought
it
to
light
without
any
nauseous
accompaniment
of
absolutes
or
supersensibles
in
view
of
the
magnitude
of
the
subject
it
has
been
handled
i
think
very
simply
and
that
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
simplicity
is
the
which
greatness
lends
to
all
its
productions
if
in
these
pages
it
has
seemed
otherwise
the
fault
is
not
that
of
the
master
but
rather
that
of
the
clerk
the
question
as
to
what
the
world
is
has
been
considered
and
the
answer
conveyed
that
will
the
essence
of
all
things
is
a
blind
unconscious
force
which
after
irrupting
in
inorganic
life
and
passing
therefrom
through
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdom
reaches
its
culmination
in
man
and
that
the
only
relief
from
its
oppressive
yoke
is
found
in
art
and
impersonal
contemplation
taking
these
premises
for
granted
and
admitting
for
a
moment
their
corollary
that
life
is
a
restless
pain
it
will
be
found
that
the
sombre
conclusion
which
follows
therefrom
has
been
deduced
with
an
exactitude
which
is
comparable
only
to
the
precision
of
a
prism
decomposing
light
literature
is
admittedly
full
of
the
embarrassments
of
transition
and
philosophy
has
naturally
its
attendant
share
it
is
of
course
not
difficult
for
the
metaphysician
to
say
this
part
of
my
work
is
theoretical
and
this
practical
but
to
give
to
the
two
that
cohesion
which
is
necessary
in
the
unfolding
of
a
single
if
voluminous
thought
is
a
feat
not
always
performed
with
success
it
is
therefore
no
little
to
schopenhauer
credit
that
he
triumphantly
connected
the
two
in
such
wise
that
they
seem
as
though
fused
in
one
and
after
disposing
of
the
world
at
large
was
able
to
turn
to
life
and
its
attendant
pain
now
in
all
grades
of
its
manifestation
will
he
teaches
dispenses
entirely
with
any
end
or
aim
it
simply
and
ceaselessly
strives
for
striving
is
its
sole
nature
as
however
any
hindrance
of
this
striving
through
an
obstacle
placed
between
it
and
its
temporary
aim
is
called
suffering
and
on
the
other
hand
the
attainment
of
its
end
satisfaction
or
happiness
it
follows
if
the
obstacles
it
meets
outnumber
the
facilities
it
encounters
that
having
no
final
end
or
aim
there
can
be
no
end
and
no
measure
of
suffering
but
does
pain
outbalance
happiness
the
question
is
certainly
complex
and
for
that
matter
unanswerable
save
by
a
cumbersome
mathematical
process
from
which
the
reader
may
well
be
spared
the
optimist
points
to
the
pleasures
of
life
the
pessimist
enumerates
its
trials
each
judges
according
to
his
lights
schopenhauer
opinion
goes
without
the
telling
and
as
he
gave
his
whole
life
to
the
subject
his
verdict
may
for
the
moment
be
allowed
to
pass
unchallenged
still
if
the
question
is
examined
no
matter
how
casually
it
will
be
seen
first
that
there
is
no
sensibility
in
the
plant
and
therefore
no
suffering
second
that
a
certain
small
degree
is
manifested
in
the
lowest
types
of
animal
life
third
that
the
capacity
to
feel
and
suffer
is
still
limited
even
in
the
case
of
the
most
intelligent
insects
fourth
that
pain
of
an
acute
degree
first
appears
with
the
nervous
system
of
the
vertebrates
fifth
that
it
continues
to
increase
in
direct
proportion
to
the
development
of
the
intelligence
and
finally
that
as
intelligence
attains
distinctness
pain
advances
with
it
and
what
swinburne
calls
the
gift
of
tears
finds
its
supreme
expression
in
man
truly
as
schopenhauer
has
expressed
it
man
is
not
a
being
to
be
greatly
envied
he
is
the
concretion
of
a
thousand
necessities
his
life
as
a
rule
is
a
struggle
for
existence
with
the
certainty
of
defeat
in
the
end
and
when
his
existence
is
assured
there
comes
a
fight
with
the
burden
of
life
an
effort
to
kill
time
and
a
vain
attempt
to
escape
ennui
nor
is
ennui
a
minor
evil
it
is
not
every
one
who
can
get
away
from
himself
schopenhauer
could
it
is
true
but
in
so
doing
he
noted
that
its
ravages
depicted
on
the
human
countenance
an
expression
of
absolute
despair
and
made
beings
who
love
one
another
as
little
as
men
do
seek
each
other
eagerly
it
drives
men
he
said
to
the
greatest
excesses
as
does
famine
its
opposite
extreme
public
precautions
are
taken
against
it
as
against
other
calamities
hence
the
historical
et
want
he
added
is
the
scourge
of
the
people
as
ennui
is
that
of
fashionable
life
in
the
middle
classes
ennui
is
represented
by
the
sabbath
and
want
by
the
other
days
of
the
week
in
this
way
between
desire
and
attainment
human
life
rolls
on
the
wish
is
in
its
nature
pain
and
satisfaction
soon
begets
satiety
no
matter
what
nature
and
fortune
may
have
done
no
matter
who
a
man
may
be
nor
what
he
may
possess
the
pain
which
is
essential
to
life
can
never
be
dodged
efforts
to
banish
suffering
effect
if
successful
only
a
change
in
its
form
in
itself
it
is
want
or
care
for
the
maintenance
of
life
and
if
in
this
form
it
is
at
last
and
with
difficulty
removed
back
it
comes
again
in
the
shape
of
love
jealousy
lust
envy
hatred
or
ambition
and
if
it
can
gain
entrance
through
none
of
these
avatars
it
comes
as
simple
boredom
against
which
we
strive
as
best
we
may
even
in
this
latter
case
if
at
last
we
get
the
upper
hand
we
shall
hardly
do
so
schopenhauer
says
without
letting
pain
in
again
in
one
of
its
earlier
forms
and
then
the
dance
begins
afresh
for
life
like
a
pendulum
swings
ever
backward
and
forward
between
pain
and
ennui
depressing
as
this
view
of
life
may
be
schopenhauer
draws
attention
to
an
aspect
of
it
from
which
a
certain
consolation
may
be
derived
and
even
a
philosophic
indifference
to
present
ills
be
attained
our
impatience
at
misfortune
he
notes
arises
very
generally
from
the
fact
that
we
regard
it
as
having
been
caused
by
a
chain
of
circumstances
which
might
easily
have
been
different
as
a
rule
we
make
little
if
any
complaint
over
the
ills
that
are
necessary
and
universal
such
for
instance
as
the
advance
of
age
and
the
death
which
must
claim
us
all
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
accidental
nature
of
the
sorrow
that
gives
its
sting
but
if
we
were
to
recognize
that
pain
is
inevitable
and
essential
to
life
and
that
nothing
depends
on
chance
save
only
the
form
in
which
it
presents
itself
and
that
consequently
the
present
suffering
fills
a
place
which
without
it
would
be
occupied
by
another
which
it
has
excluded
then
from
convictions
of
this
nature
a
considerable
amount
of
stoical
equanimity
would
be
produced
and
the
amount
of
anxious
care
which
now
pervades
the
world
would
be
notably
diminished
but
fortifications
of
this
description
however
cunningly
devised
form
no
bulwark
against
pain
itself
for
pain
according
to
schopenhauer
is
positive
the
one
thing
that
is
felt
while
on
the
other
hand
satisfaction
or
as
it
is
termed
happiness
is
a
purely
negative
condition
against
this
theory
it
is
unnecessary
to
bring
to
bear
any
great
battery
of
argument
many
thinkers
have
disagreed
with
him
on
this
point
as
they
have
also
disagreed
with
his
assertion
that
pleasure
is
always
preceded
by
a
want
it
is
true
of
course
that
unexpected
pleasures
have
a
delight
whose
value
is
entirely
independent
of
antecedent
desire
but
unexpected
pleasures
are
rare
they
do
not
come
to
us
every
day
and
when
they
do
they
cease
to
be
pleasures
indeed
their
rarity
may
in
this
respect
be
looked
upon
as
the
exception
which
confirms
the
rule
ample
proof
however
of
the
negativity
of
happiness
is
found
in
art
and
especially
in
poetry
epic
and
dramatic
verse
represent
struggles
efforts
and
combats
for
happiness
but
happiness
itself
complete
and
enduring
is
never
depicted
up
to
the
last
scene
the
hero
copes
with
dangers
and
battleaxes
difficulties
whereupon
the
curtain
falls
upon
his
happiness
which
being
completely
negative
can
not
be
the
subject
of
art
the
idyl
it
is
true
professes
to
treat
of
happiness
but
in
so
doing
it
blunders
sadly
for
the
poet
either
finds
his
verse
turning
beneath
his
hands
into
an
insignificant
epic
made
up
of
feeble
sorrows
trivial
pleasures
and
trifling
efforts
or
else
it
becomes
merely
a
description
of
the
charm
and
beauty
of
nature
the
same
thing
schopenhauer
says
is
noticeable
in
music
melody
is
a
deviation
from
the
keynote
to
which
after
many
mutations
it
at
last
returns
but
the
keynote
which
expresses
the
satisfaction
of
the
will
is
when
prolonged
perfectly
monotonous
and
wearisome
in
the
extreme
from
the
logic
of
these
arguments
it
is
clear
that
voltaire
was
not
very
far
wrong
when
he
said
happiness
is
but
a
dream
and
only
pain
is
real
i
have
thought
so
for
years
and
i
know
of
no
better
plan
than
to
resign
myself
to
the
inevitable
and
reflect
that
flies
were
born
to
be
devoured
by
spiders
and
man
to
be
consumed
by
care
to
this
conclusion
the
optimist
will
naturally
object
but
he
does
so
in
the
face
of
history
and
experience
either
of
which
is
quite
competent
to
prove
that
this
world
is
far
from
being
the
best
one
possible
if
neither
of
them
succeeds
in
so
doing
then
let
him
wander
through
the
hospitals
the
cholera
slums
the
of
the
surgeon
the
prisons
the
the
the
battlefields
or
any
one
of
the
numberless
haunts
of
nameless
misery
or
if
all
of
these
are
too
far
or
too
inconvenient
let
him
take
a
turn
into
one
of
the
many
factories
where
men
and
women
and
even
infants
work
from
ten
to
fourteen
hours
a
day
at
mechanical
labor
simply
that
they
may
continue
to
enjoy
the
exquisite
delight
of
living
moreover
as
schopenhauer
asks
with
grim
irony
where
did
dante
find
the
materials
for
his
if
not
from
this
world
and
yet
is
not
his
picture
exhaustively
satisfactory
to
some
minds
it
is
even
a
trifle
overcharged
but
look
at
his
paradise
when
he
attempted
to
depict
it
he
had
nothing
to
guide
him
this
pleasant
world
could
not
offer
a
single
suggestion
and
so
being
obliged
to
say
something
and
yet
not
knowing
what
to
say
he
palms
off
in
place
of
a
celestial
panorama
the
instruction
and
advice
which
he
imagines
himself
as
receiving
from
beatrice
and
the
saints
briefly
then
life
to
the
pessimist
is
a
motiveless
desire
a
constant
pain
and
continued
struggle
followed
by
death
and
so
on
in
until
the
planet
crust
crumbles
to
dust
since
therefore
life
is
so
deplorable
the
deduction
seems
to
follow
that
it
is
better
to
take
the
poet
advice
count
the
joys
thine
hours
have
seen
count
thy
days
from
anguish
free
and
know
whatever
thou
hast
been
is
something
better
not
to
be
but
here
the
question
naturally
arises
how
is
this
annihilation
to
be
accomplished
through
a
vulgar
and
commonplace
suicide
not
at
all
schopenhauer
is
far
too
logical
to
suggest
a
palliative
so
fruitless
and
as
that
for
suicide
far
from
being
a
denial
of
the
will
to
live
is
one
of
its
strongest
affirmations
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
the
man
who
takes
his
own
life
really
wants
to
live
what
he
does
not
want
are
the
misery
and
trials
attendant
on
his
particular
existence
he
abolishes
the
individual
but
not
the
race
the
species
continues
and
pain
with
it
in
what
manner
then
can
we
decently
rid
ourselves
and
all
who
would
otherwise
follow
of
the
pangs
and
torments
of
life
schopenhauer
will
give
the
receipt
in
a
moment
but
to
understand
the
method
clearly
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
glance
at
the
metaphysics
of
love
we
are
told
by
frauenstadt
that
schopenhauer
considered
this
portion
of
his
philosophy
to
be
a
pearl
a
pearl
it
may
be
but
as
such
it
is
not
entirely
suited
to
an
setting
nevertheless
as
it
is
important
to
gain
some
idea
of
what
this
recluse
thought
of
the
delicate
lever
which
disturbs
the
gravest
interests
and
whose
meshes
entwine
peer
and
peasant
alike
a
brief
description
of
it
will
not
be
entirely
out
of
place
by
way
of
preface
it
may
be
said
that
save
plato
no
other
philosopher
has
cared
to
consider
a
subject
so
simple
yet
complex
as
this
and
of
common
accord
it
has
been
relinquished
to
the
abuse
of
the
poets
and
the
praise
of
the
rhymesters
it
may
be
perhaps
that
from
its
nature
it
revolted
at
logic
and
that
the
seekers
for
truth
in
trying
to
clutch
it
resembled
the
horseman
in
the
familiar
picture
who
over
ditches
and
dykes
pursues
a
phantom
which
floats
always
before
him
and
yet
is
ever
intangible
la
rochefoucauld
who
was
ready
enough
with
phrases
admitted
that
it
was
indefinable
a
compatriot
of
his
tried
to
compass
it
with
the
epigram
à
deux
balzac
gave
it
an
escutcheon
every
one
has
had
more
or
less
to
say
about
it
and
as
some
have
said
more
than
they
thought
while
others
thought
more
than
they
said
it
has
been
beribboned
with
enough
comparisons
to
form
an
unportable
volume
while
its
history
from
tatterdemalia
to
marlborough
house
is
written
in
blood
as
well
as
in
books
love
however
is
the
basis
of
religion
the
mainstay
of
ethics
as
well
as
the
inspiration
of
lyric
and
epic
verse
it
is
moreover
the
principal
subject
of
every
dramatic
comic
and
classic
work
in
india
europe
and
america
and
the
inexhaustible
spring
from
whose
waters
the
fecund
lands
of
fiction
produce
fresh
crops
more
regularly
than
the
seasons
it
is
a
subject
never
lacking
in
actuality
and
yet
one
to
which
each
century
has
given
a
different
color
it
is
recognized
as
a
disease
and
recommended
as
a
remedy
and
yet
what
is
it
there
are
poets
who
have
said
it
was
an
illusion
but
however
it
may
appear
to
them
it
is
no
illusion
to
the
philosopher
far
from
it
its
reality
and
importance
increase
in
the
ratio
of
its
ardor
and
whether
it
turns
to
the
tragic
or
the
comic
a
love
affair
is
to
him
above
all
other
early
aims
the
one
which
presents
the
gravest
aspects
and
the
one
most
worthy
of
consideration
for
all
the
passions
and
intrigues
of
reduced
to
their
simplest
expression
and
divested
of
all
accompanying
allurements
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
combination
of
the
future
generation
it
is
through
this
frivolity
schopenhauer
says
that
the
are
to
appear
on
the
stage
when
we
have
made
our
exit
the
existence
of
these
future
actors
is
absolutely
conditioned
on
the
general
instinct
of
love
while
their
nature
and
characteristics
depend
on
individual
choice
such
is
the
whole
problem
love
is
the
supreme
will
to
live
the
genius
of
the
species
and
nature
being
highly
strategic
covers
itself
for
the
fulfillment
of
its
aims
with
a
mask
of
objective
admiration
and
deludes
the
individual
so
cleverly
therewith
that
he
takes
that
to
be
his
own
happiness
which
in
reality
is
but
the
maintenance
of
the
species
the
love
affairs
of
therefore
instead
of
representing
questions
of
personal
joy
or
sorrow
are
simply
and
solely
a
series
of
grave
meditations
on
the
existence
and
composition
of
the
future
generation
it
is
this
grand
preoccupation
that
causes
the
pathos
and
sublimity
of
love
it
is
this
that
makes
it
so
difficult
to
lend
any
interest
to
a
drama
with
which
the
question
is
not
intermingled
it
is
this
that
makes
love
an
matter
and
yet
an
inexhaustible
topic
it
is
this
that
explains
the
gravity
of
the
it
plays
the
importance
which
it
gives
to
the
most
trivial
incidents
and
above
all
it
is
this
that
creates
its
measureless
ardor
to
quote
madame
ackermann
ces
délires
sacrés
ces
désirs
sans
mesure
déchaînés
dans
vos
flancs
comme
essaims
ces
transports
déjà
future
qui
en
vos
seins
however
disinterested
and
ideal
an
affection
may
seem
however
noble
and
elevated
an
attachment
may
be
it
is
from
standpoint
simply
will
projecting
itself
into
the
creation
of
another
being
and
the
moment
in
which
this
new
being
rises
from
chaos
into
the
of
its
existence
is
precisely
that
moment
in
which
two
young
people
begin
to
fancy
each
other
it
is
in
the
innocent
union
and
first
embrace
of
the
eyes
that
the
microbe
originates
though
of
course
like
other
germs
it
is
fragile
and
prompt
to
disappear
in
fact
there
are
few
phenomena
more
striking
than
the
profoundly
serious
yet
unconscious
manner
in
which
two
young
people
meeting
for
the
first
time
observe
one
another
this
common
examination
this
mutual
study
is
as
has
been
stated
the
meditation
of
the
genius
of
the
species
and
its
result
determines
the
degree
of
their
reciprocal
inclination
in
comedy
and
romance
the
sympathies
of
the
spectator
are
invariably
excited
at
the
spectacle
of
these
two
young
people
and
especially
so
when
they
are
discovered
defending
their
affection
or
to
speak
more
exactly
the
projects
of
the
genius
of
the
species
against
the
hostility
of
their
parents
who
are
solely
occupied
with
their
individual
interests
it
is
unquestionably
for
this
reason
that
the
interest
in
plays
and
novels
centres
on
the
entrance
of
this
serene
spirit
who
with
his
lawless
aims
and
aspirations
threatens
the
peace
of
the
other
actors
and
usually
digs
deep
graves
for
their
happiness
as
a
rule
he
succeeds
and
the
climax
comformably
with
poetic
justice
satisfies
the
spectator
who
then
goes
away
leaving
the
lovers
to
their
victory
and
associating
himself
in
the
idea
that
at
last
they
are
happy
whereas
according
to
schopenhauer
they
have
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
their
parents
simply
given
themselves
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
good
of
the
species
in
tragedies
in
which
love
is
the
mainspring
the
lovers
usually
die
because
as
follows
from
the
foregoing
logic
they
have
been
unable
to
triumph
over
those
designs
of
which
they
were
but
the
instruments
as
schopenhauer
adds
however
a
lover
may
become
comic
as
well
as
tragic
and
this
for
the
reason
that
in
either
case
he
is
in
the
hands
of
a
higher
power
which
dominates
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
is
so
to
speak
carried
out
of
himself
and
his
actions
in
consequence
become
disproportioned
to
his
character
hence
it
is
that
the
higher
forms
of
love
bring
with
them
such
poetic
coloring
such
transcendental
and
supernatural
elevation
that
they
seem
to
veil
their
true
end
and
aim
from
him
completely
for
the
moment
he
is
animated
by
the
genius
of
the
species
he
has
received
a
mission
to
found
an
indefinite
series
of
descendants
and
moreover
to
endow
them
with
a
certain
constitution
and
form
them
of
certain
elements
which
are
only
obtainable
from
him
and
a
particular
woman
the
feeling
which
he
then
has
of
acting
in
an
affair
of
great
importance
transports
the
lover
to
such
superterrestial
heights
and
garbs
his
material
nature
with
such
an
appearance
of
immateriality
that
however
prosaic
he
may
generally
be
his
love
at
once
assumes
a
poetic
aspect
a
result
which
is
often
incompatible
with
his
dignity
in
brief
the
instinct
which
guides
an
insect
to
a
certain
flower
or
fruit
and
which
causes
it
to
disregard
any
inconvenience
or
danger
in
the
attainment
of
its
end
is
precisely
analogous
to
that
sentiment
which
every
poet
has
tried
to
express
without
ever
exhausting
the
topic
indeed
the
yearning
of
love
which
brings
with
it
the
idea
that
union
with
a
certain
woman
will
be
an
infinite
happiness
and
that
the
inability
to
obtain
her
will
be
productive
of
insufferable
anguish
can
not
according
to
schopenhauer
be
considered
to
have
its
origin
in
the
needs
of
the
ephemeral
individual
it
is
in
fact
but
the
sigh
of
the
genius
of
the
species
who
sees
herein
a
unique
opportunity
of
realizing
his
aims
and
who
in
consequence
is
violently
agitated
inasmuch
as
love
rests
on
an
illusion
of
personal
happiness
which
the
supervising
spirit
is
at
little
pains
to
evoke
so
soon
as
the
tribute
is
paid
the
illusion
vanishes
and
the
individual
left
to
his
own
resources
is
mystified
at
finding
that
so
many
sublime
and
heroic
efforts
have
resulted
simply
in
a
vulgar
satisfaction
and
that
taking
all
things
into
consideration
he
is
no
better
off
than
he
was
before
as
a
rule
theseus
once
consoled
ariadne
is
forsaken
and
had
petrarch
passion
been
requited
his
song
would
then
have
ceased
as
that
of
the
bird
does
when
once
its
eggs
are
in
the
nest
every
then
is
contracted
in
the
interest
of
the
future
generation
and
not
for
the
profit
of
the
individual
the
parties
imagine
it
is
true
that
it
is
for
their
own
happiness
but
as
schopenhauer
has
carefully
explained
owing
to
the
instinctive
illusion
which
is
the
essence
of
love
they
soon
discover
that
they
are
not
united
to
each
other
in
any
respect
and
this
fact
becomes
at
once
evident
when
the
illusion
which
first
joined
them
has
at
last
disappeared
hence
it
happens
schopenhauer
adds
that
are
usually
unhappy
for
they
but
assure
the
presence
of
the
next
generation
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
or
as
the
proverb
runs
quien
se
casa
por
amores
ha
de
viver
con
dolores
if
now
he
concludes
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
tumult
of
life
we
find
that
all
men
are
occupied
with
its
torments
we
see
them
uniting
their
efforts
in
a
struggle
with
want
and
massing
their
strength
against
misery
and
yet
there
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
are
two
lovers
whose
eyes
meet
charged
with
desire
but
why
do
they
seem
so
timid
why
are
their
actions
so
mysterious
it
is
because
they
are
traitors
who
would
perpetuate
the
pain
which
without
them
would
soon
come
to
that
end
which
they
would
prevent
as
others
have
done
before
them
there
can
be
but
one
objection
to
this
novel
theory
which
at
least
has
the
merit
of
being
thoroughly
logical
as
well
as
that
of
connecting
a
subject
so
intangible
as
love
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
whole
doctrine
and
that
is
that
it
leaves
those
higher
and
purer
realms
of
affection
of
which
most
of
us
are
conscious
almost
entirely
unvisited
this
objection
however
loses
much
of
its
force
when
it
is
remembered
that
schopenhauer
gave
to
this
division
of
his
subject
the
title
of
metaphysics
of
love
and
in
so
doing
sought
solely
to
place
the
matter
on
a
scientific
basis
in
this
he
has
undoubtedly
succeeded
and
his
explanation
if
characteristic
is
not
for
that
reason
necessarily
unsound
in
another
essay
which
is
narrowly
connected
with
the
one
in
hand
he
takes
the
reader
from
the
highest
spheres
of
pure
love
to
the
foundation
of
ethics
and
shows
that
both
are
derived
from
an
identical
sentiment
which
he
calls
compassion
and
since
grief
is
king
what
better
primate
can
he
have
than
sympathy
to
the
thinker
who
sees
joy
submerged
by
pain
and
death
rule
uncontested
what
higher
sentiment
can
come
than
that
of
pity
schopenhauer
has
however
been
very
frequently
blamed
for
giving
this
as
the
foundation
of
morality
to
many
it
has
seemed
too
narrow
and
incomplete
and
an
academy
that
of
copenhagen
refused
to
crown
his
essay
for
that
very
reason
but
whatever
objections
may
be
brought
against
it
its
originality
at
least
is
unattackable
in
ancient
philosophy
ethics
was
a
treatise
of
happiness
in
modern
works
it
is
generally
a
doctrine
of
eternal
salvation
to
schopenhauer
it
is
neither
for
if
happiness
is
unobtainable
the
subject
is
necessarily
untreatable
from
such
a
standpoint
and
on
the
other
hand
if
morality
is
practiced
in
the
hope
of
future
reward
or
from
fear
of
future
punishment
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
spring
from
any
great
purity
of
intention
with
such
incentives
it
is
but
a
doctrine
of
expediency
and
at
best
merely
adapted
to
guide
the
more
or
less
interested
motives
of
human
action
but
as
the
detection
of
an
interested
motive
behind
an
action
admittedly
suffices
to
destroy
its
moral
value
it
follows
that
the
criterion
of
an
act
of
moral
value
must
be
the
absence
of
any
egotistic
or
interested
motive
schopenhauer
points
out
that
acts
of
this
description
are
discernible
in
the
unostentatious
works
of
charity
from
which
no
possible
reward
can
accrue
and
in
which
no
personal
interest
is
at
work
so
soon
he
says
as
sympathy
is
awakened
the
dividing
line
which
separates
one
being
from
another
is
effaced
the
welfare
and
misfortunes
of
another
are
to
the
sympathizer
as
his
own
his
distress
speaks
to
him
and
the
suffering
is
shared
in
common
meanwhile
this
phenomenon
which
he
sees
to
be
of
almost
daily
occurrence
is
yet
one
which
reason
can
not
explain
all
even
the
most
have
experienced
it
and
they
have
done
so
very
often
intuitively
and
to
their
own
great
surprise
men
for
instance
risk
their
lives
spontaneously
without
possible
hope
of
gain
or
applause
for
a
total
stranger
england
some
years
ago
paid
twenty
millions
sterling
to
free
the
slaves
in
her
colonies
and
the
motive
of
that
grandiose
action
can
certainly
not
be
attributed
to
religion
for
the
new
testament
does
not
contain
a
word
against
slavery
though
in
the
days
to
which
it
refers
slavery
was
universal
it
is
pity
then
according
to
schopenhauer
which
is
the
base
of
every
action
that
has
a
true
moral
value
indeed
he
says
the
soundest
the
surest
guarantee
of
morality
is
the
compassionate
sympathy
that
unites
us
with
everything
that
lives
before
it
the
casuist
is
dumb
whoso
possesses
it
is
incapable
of
causing
the
slightest
harm
or
injury
to
any
one
rather
to
all
will
he
be
magnanimous
he
will
forgive
he
will
assist
and
each
of
his
actions
will
be
distinguished
by
its
justice
and
its
charity
in
brief
compassion
is
the
spontaneous
product
of
nature
which
while
independent
of
religion
and
culture
is
yet
so
pervasive
that
everywhere
it
is
confidently
evoked
and
nowhere
counted
among
the
unknown
gods
it
is
compassion
that
makes
the
mother
love
best
her
feeblest
child
truly
the
man
who
possesses
no
compassion
is
outside
of
humanity
the
idea
that
runs
through
the
whole
subject
and
which
is
here
noted
because
its
development
leads
to
the
logical
climax
of
the
entire
philosophy
is
that
all
love
is
sympathy
or
rather
all
pure
love
is
sympathy
and
all
love
which
is
not
sympathy
is
selfishness
of
course
combinations
of
the
two
are
frequently
met
genuine
friendship
for
instance
is
a
mixture
of
both
the
selfishness
consisting
in
the
pleasure
experienced
in
the
presence
of
the
friend
and
the
sympathy
in
the
participation
in
his
joys
and
sorrows
with
this
theory
as
a
schopenhauer
reduces
every
human
action
to
one
or
sometimes
to
two
or
at
most
three
motives
the
first
is
selfishness
which
seeks
its
own
welfare
the
second
is
the
perversity
or
viciousness
which
attacks
the
welfare
of
others
and
the
third
is
compassion
which
seeks
their
good
the
egotist
has
but
one
sincere
desire
and
that
is
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
personal
to
preserve
his
existence
to
free
it
from
pain
and
privation
and
even
to
possess
every
delight
that
he
is
capable
of
imagining
such
is
his
end
and
aim
every
obstacle
between
his
selfishness
and
his
desires
is
an
enemy
to
be
suppressed
so
far
as
possible
he
would
like
to
possess
everything
enjoy
everything
dominate
everything
his
motto
is
all
for
me
nothing
for
you
when
therefore
the
power
of
the
state
is
eluded
or
becomes
momentarily
paralyzed
all
at
once
the
riot
of
selfishness
and
perversity
begins
one
has
but
to
read
the
causes
célèbres
or
the
history
of
anarchies
to
see
what
selfishness
and
perversity
are
capable
of
accomplishing
when
once
their
leash
is
loosed
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
ladder
is
he
whose
desire
for
life
is
so
violent
that
he
cares
nothing
for
the
rights
of
others
and
for
a
small
personal
advantage
oppresses
robs
or
kills
above
him
is
the
man
who
never
violates
the
rights
of
others
unless
he
has
a
tempting
opportunity
and
can
do
so
with
every
reasonable
assurance
of
safety
the
respectable
citizen
who
pays
his
taxes
and
and
once
in
a
while
serves
on
the
jury
on
a
higher
level
is
he
who
possessing
a
considerable
income
uses
but
little
of
it
for
himself
and
gives
the
rest
to
the
poor
the
man
who
makes
less
distinction
than
is
usually
made
between
himself
and
others
such
an
one
is
as
little
likely
to
let
others
starve
while
he
himself
has
enough
and
to
spare
as
another
would
be
to
hunger
one
day
that
he
might
eat
more
the
next
to
a
man
of
this
description
the
veil
of
mâyâ
which
may
be
taken
to
mean
the
veil
of
illusions
has
become
transparent
he
recognizes
himself
in
every
being
and
consequently
in
the
sufferer
let
this
veil
of
mâyâ
be
lifted
from
the
eyes
of
a
man
to
such
an
extent
that
he
makes
no
distinction
at
all
between
himself
and
others
and
is
not
only
highly
benevolent
but
ready
at
all
times
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
common
good
then
he
has
in
him
the
holiness
of
the
saint
and
the
germ
that
may
flower
into
renunciation
the
phenomenon
schopenhauer
says
by
which
this
change
is
marked
is
the
transition
from
virtue
to
asceticism
in
other
words
it
then
no
longer
suffices
for
him
to
love
others
as
himself
there
arises
within
him
a
horror
of
the
kernel
and
essence
of
the
world
which
recognizably
is
full
of
misery
and
of
which
his
own
existence
is
an
expression
and
thereupon
denying
the
nature
that
is
in
him
and
ceasing
to
will
anything
he
gives
himself
up
to
complete
indifferentism
to
all
things
such
in
outline
is
schopenhauer
theory
of
ethics
which
starting
from
the
principle
of
kindness
of
heart
leads
to
the
renunciation
of
all
things
and
curious
as
the
may
appear
at
last
to
universal
deliverance
in
earlier
pages
the
world
has
been
explained
to
be
utterly
unsatisfactory
and
it
has
been
hinted
that
the
suicide
were
he
delivered
of
his
suffering
would
gladly
rehabilitate
himself
with
life
for
it
is
the
form
of
life
that
the
suicide
repudiates
not
life
itself
but
life
to
be
scientifically
annihilated
should
be
abolished
not
only
in
its
suffering
but
in
its
empty
pleasures
and
happiness
as
well
its
entire
inanity
should
be
recognized
and
the
whole
root
cut
once
and
for
all
in
explaining
in
what
manner
this
is
to
be
accomplished
schopenhauer
carries
his
reader
far
off
into
the
shadows
of
the
orient
on
the
one
side
is
the
lethargy
of
india
on
the
other
china
drugged
with
opium
while
above
all
rises
the
fantasy
of
the
east
the
dogma
of
metempsychosis
as
has
been
seen
schopenhauer
holds
that
there
is
in
every
life
an
indestructible
principle
this
belief
he
shares
with
the
buddhist
the
brahmin
the
ancient
druid
and
the
early
scandinavian
historically
speaking
the
doctrine
is
so
old
that
a
wise
anglican
is
reported
to
have
judged
it
fatherless
motherless
and
without
genealogy
properly
speaking
however
this
creed
does
not
now
insist
that
there
is
a
transmigration
of
the
soul
but
rather
in
accordance
with
recent
esoteric
teaching
it
implies
simply
that
the
fruit
of
good
and
evil
actions
revives
with
the
individual
through
a
succession
of
lives
until
the
evil
is
outbalanced
the
good
is
paramount
and
deliverance
is
at
last
attained
in
other
words
the
beautiful
myth
of
the
early
faith
is
superseded
by
an
absurd
and
awkward
palingenesia
schopenhauer
gives
the
name
of
will
to
that
force
which
in
indian
philosophy
is
considered
to
resurrect
with
man
across
successive
lives
and
with
which
the
horror
of
ulterior
existences
reappears
it
is
from
this
nightmare
that
we
are
summoned
to
awake
but
in
the
summons
we
are
told
that
the
awakening
can
only
come
with
a
recognition
of
the
true
nature
of
the
dream
the
work
to
be
accomplished
therefore
is
less
physical
than
moral
we
are
not
to
strangle
ourselves
in
sleep
but
to
rise
out
of
it
in
meditation
in
man
says
schopenhauer
the
advances
to
consciousness
and
consequently
to
that
point
where
it
can
readily
choose
between
its
continuance
or
abolition
man
is
the
saviour
and
all
nature
awaits
its
redemption
through
him
he
is
at
once
the
priest
and
the
victim
if
therefore
in
the
succeeding
generations
the
appetite
for
death
has
been
so
highly
cultivated
and
compassion
is
so
generally
practiced
that
a
widespread
and
united
pity
is
felt
for
all
things
then
through
asceticism
which
the
reader
may
construe
universal
and
absolute
chastity
that
state
of
indifference
will
be
produced
in
which
subject
and
object
disappear
and
the
sigh
of
the
egoist
will
once
choked
thereby
into
a
the
world
will
be
delivered
from
pain
it
is
this
schopenhauer
exclaims
in
his
concluding
paragraph
that
the
hindus
have
expressed
in
the
empty
terms
of
nirvâna
and
reabsorption
in
brahma
we
readily
recognize
that
what
remains
after
the
entire
abolition
of
the
will
is
without
effect
on
those
in
whom
it
still
works
but
to
those
in
whom
it
has
been
crushed
what
is
this
world
of
ours
with
its
suns
and
stellar
systems
nothing
in
the
preface
to
the
second
edition
of
the
welt
als
wille
und
vorstellung
schopenhauer
recommends
that
the
work
be
read
by
the
light
of
his
supplementary
essays
this
task
beyond
demanding
an
agility
of
pencil
and
some
concentration
is
otherwise
one
of
the
most
morbidly
agreeable
that
can
be
suggested
the
sensation
that
comes
with
a
first
reading
is
that
of
an
abrupt
translation
to
the
wonders
of
a
world
which
heretofore
may
have
been
dimly
perceived
but
which
then
for
the
first
time
is
visited
and
thoroughly
explored
the
perspective
it
is
true
holds
no
edens
in
the
distance
there
are
no
utopias
but
when
the
journey
is
ended
and
the
book
laid
aside
the
peaks
and
abysses
to
which
the
reader
has
been
conducted
stand
steadfast
in
memory
and
the
whole
panorama
of
deception
and
pain
groups
itself
in
a
retrospect
as
sudden
and
clear
as
that
which
attends
the
last
moments
of
the
drowning
man
and
schopenhauer
is
the
least
pedantic
and
yet
the
most
luminous
of
ciceroni
in
pages
which
hugo
would
not
disavow
and
of
which
the
foregoing
analysis
can
give
at
best
but
a
bald
and
unsatisfactory
idea
he
explains
each
height
and
ruin
with
an
untiring
verve
and
with
an
irony
as
keen
and
fundamental
as
swift
but
beyond
his
charm
as
a
stylist
and
his
exhaustive
knowledge
of
life
he
claims
attention
through
his
theory
of
the
universal
force
his
originality
in
the
treatment
of
ethics
and
the
profound
ingenuity
with
which
he
attaches
everything
from
a
globule
to
an
adagio
in
b
flat
to
his
general
system
it
is
said
that
philosophy
begins
precisely
where
science
ends
the
doctrine
therefore
which
has
just
been
considered
is
in
a
measure
impregnable
to
criticism
reduced
to
its
simplest
expression
it
amounts
briefly
to
this
an
unknown
principle
an
which
no
term
can
translate
but
of
which
will
taken
in
the
widest
sense
of
force
is
the
rendition
the
least
inexact
explains
the
universe
the
highest
manifestation
of
will
is
man
any
obstacle
it
encounters
is
pain
pain
is
the
attendant
of
life
man
however
duped
by
the
instinct
of
love
has
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
prolong
through
his
children
the
sorrowful
continuation
of
unhappy
generations
the
hope
of
a
future
existence
in
a
better
world
seems
to
be
a
consolation
but
as
a
hope
it
rests
on
faith
since
life
is
not
a
benefit
chaos
is
preferable
beyond
suicide
which
is
not
a
philosophic
solution
there
are
but
two
remedies
for
the
misery
of
life
one
a
palliative
is
found
in
art
and
disinterested
contemplation
the
other
a
specific
in
asceticism
or
absolute
chastity
were
chastity
universal
it
would
drain
the
source
of
humanity
and
pain
would
disappear
for
if
man
is
the
highest
manifestation
of
will
it
is
permissible
to
assume
that
were
he
to
die
out
the
weaker
reflections
would
pass
away
as
the
twilight
vanishes
with
the
full
light
all
great
religions
have
praised
asceticism
and
in
consequence
it
was
not
difficult
for
schopenhauer
to
cite
in
support
of
his
theory
a
number
of
texts
from
the
gnostics
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
the
thinkers
such
as
angelius
silesius
and
meister
eckhard
the
mystics
and
the
quietists
together
with
pertinent
extracts
from
the
bible
and
the
sacred
books
of
the
orient
but
none
of
these
authorities
seem
to
have
grasped
the
principle
which
according
to
schopenhauer
lies
at
the
root
of
asceticism
and
constitutes
its
chief
value
at
best
they
have
seen
in
it
but
the
merit
of
obedience
to
a
fantastic
law
the
endurance
of
a
gratuitous
privation
or
else
they
have
blessed
in
celibacy
the
exaltation
of
personal
purity
and
the
renunciation
of
worldly
pleasures
from
the
philosophic
standpoint
however
the
value
of
asceticism
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
leads
to
deliverance
prepares
the
world
for
the
annihilation
of
pain
and
indicates
the
path
to
be
pursued
through
his
labors
and
sympathy
the
apostle
of
charity
succeeds
in
saving
from
death
a
few
families
which
in
consequence
of
his
kindness
are
condemned
to
a
long
misery
the
ascetic
on
the
other
hand
does
far
better
he
preserves
whole
generations
from
life
and
in
two
or
three
instances
very
nearly
succeeded
in
saving
the
world
the
women
schopenhauer
says
somewhere
refused
to
join
in
the
enterprise
and
that
is
why
i
hate
them
if
asceticism
were
practiced
by
all
men
it
follows
that
pain
so
far
as
man
is
concerned
would
cease
in
it
but
is
it
permissible
to
assume
that
with
the
disappearance
of
man
the
world
will
vanish
with
him
in
other
words
if
humanity
dies
out
that
animality
must
necessarily
follow
after
it
is
here
if
anywhere
that
schopenhauer
has
blundered
the
world
is
deplorably
bad
let
the
optimist
and
thoughtless
say
what
they
will
and
it
would
undoubtedly
be
very
advantageous
to
have
the
whole
universe
tumble
into
sudden
chaos
but
that
such
a
consummation
is
to
be
brought
about
by
voluntary
asceticism
is
in
the
present
state
of
society
and
independent
of
the
opposition
of
women
greatly
to
be
doubted
schopenhauer
has
denied
that
a
being
superior
to
man
could
exist
if
then
the
nineteenth
century
which
plumes
itself
on
the
mental
elevation
and
culture
of
the
age
and
in
looking
back
at
the
ignorance
of
earlier
epochs
considers
itself
the
top
of
all
creation
if
then
the
nineteenth
century
in
its
perspicacity
refuses
such
a
solution
there
is
little
left
for
humanity
to
do
save
to
bear
the
pains
of
life
as
it
may
or
better
still
with
the
resignation
which
leopardi
long
ago
suggested
when
putting
aside
this
eccentric
theory
of
deliverance
the
teaching
of
schopenhauer

according

the

with

the

of

it
was
with
something
of
the
lassitude
which
succeeds
an
orgy
that
schopenhauer
turned
from
the
riot
of
the
will
and
undertook
to
examine
such
possibilities
of
happiness
as
life
may
yet
afford
and
as

thereto
the
manner
in
which
such
possibilities
may
be

he
brought
a
sumptuous
variety
of
reflections
which
are
summed
up
in
a
essay
entitled
lebensweisheit
or
conduct
of
life
but
in
which
in
spite
of
the
luxury
of
detail
and
brilliancy
of
description
schopenhauer
almost
unconsciously
reminds
the
reader
of
a
man
who
takes
his
constitutional
at
midnight
and
preferentially
when
it
rains
the
suggestions
that
occur
to
him
are
almost
flamboyant
in
their
intensity
and
yet
about
them
all
there
circles
such
a
series
of
dull
limitations
that
one
somehow
feels
a
sense
of
dumbness
and
suffocation
a
longing
to
get
away
and
rush
out
into
an
atmosphere
less
charged
with
sombre
conclusions
concerning
the
baseness
and
shabbiness
of
life
schopenhauer
has
but
little
to
say
he
touches
but
lightly
on
its
infinite
vulgarity
while
its
occasional
splendor
is
equally
unnoticed
indeed
he
preaches
not
to
redeem
nor
convert
but
simply
that
his
hearers
may
be
in
some
measure
enlightened
as
to
the
bald
unsatisfactoriness
of
all
things
and
so
direct
their
individual
steps
as
to
come
as
little
in
contact
with
avoidable
misery
as
possible
to
many
it
will
of
course
seem
quite
appalling
that
a
mind
so
richly
receptive
as
his
should
have
chosen
such
shaggy
moorlands
for
habitual
contemplation
when
had
he
wished
he
might
have
feasted
his
eyes
on
resplendent
panoramas
the
moorlands
however
were
not
of
his
making
he
was
merely
a
painter
filling
in
the
landscape
with
objects
which
stood
within
the
perspective
and
if
he
happened
upon
no
resplendent
panoramas
the
fault
lay
simply
in
the
fact
that
he
had
been
baffled
in
his
attempt
to
find
them
voltaire
says
somewhere
i
do
not
know
what
the
life
eternal
may
be
but
at
all
events
this
one
is
a
very
poor
joke
in
this
sentiment
schopenhauer
solemnly
concurred
that
which
was
a
to
the
one
became
a
theory
to
the
other
and
it
is
to
his
treatment
of
this
subject
that
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
now
invited
the
introduction
which
he
gives
to
it
if
not
as
light
as
the
overture
to
a
ballet
will
it
is
believed
still
be
found
both
interesting
and
instructive
while
its
conclusion
and
supplement
form
it
may
be
noted
an
admitted
part
of
that
which
is
best
of
the
modern
essayists
the
first
chapter
opens
with
an
enumeration
of
those
possessions
which
differentiate
the
lot
of
man
and
which
in
so
doing
form
the
basis
of
possible
happiness
it
has
been
said
that
the
happiest
land
is
the
one
which
has
little
if
any
need
of
importations
and
he
notes
that
the
man
is
most
contented
whose
interior
wealth
suffices
for
his
own
amusement
and
who
demands
but
little
if
anything
from
the
exterior
world
or
as
oliver
goldsmith
has
expressed
it
still
to
ourselves
in
place
consigned
our
own
felicity
we
make
or
find
in
a
world
such
as
ours
schopenhauer
thinks
he
who
has
much
to
draw
upon
from
within
is
not
unlike
a
room
in
which
stands
a
christmas
tree
bright
warm
and
joyous
while
all
about
are
the
snows
and
icicles
of
a
december
night
that
which
a
man
is
in
himself
that
which
accompanies
him
into
solitude
and
which
none
can
give
him
or
take
from
him
is
necessarily
more
essential
than
all
that
he
may
possess
or
all
that
he
may
appear
in
the
eyes
of
others
the
scholar
for
instance
even
when
utterly
alone
feeds
most
agreeably
on
his
own
thoughts
and
we
are
most
of
us
very
well
aware
that
he
whose
intelligence
is
limited
may
ceaselessly
vary
his
festivals
and
amusements
without
ever
succeeding
in
freeing
himself
from
the
baleful
weariness
of
boredom
according
to
schopenhauer
then
the
supreme
and
elements
of
earthly
happiness
are
subjective
possessions
such
as
a
noble
character
a
capable
mind
an
easy
disposition
and
a
and
healthy
body
and
it
is
these
gifts
he
rightly
insists
that
should
be
cultivated
and
preserved
even
at
the
expense
of
wealth
and
emolument
an
easy
disposition
however
is
that
which
above
all
other
things
contributes
most
directly
to
contentment
gayety
of
heart
is
indeed
its
own
recompense
and
he
who
is
really
gay
has
a
reason
for
so
being
from
the
very
fact
that
he
is
so
supposing
a
man
to
be
young
handsome
rich
and
respected
the
one
question
to
be
asked
about
him
is
is
he
on
the
other
hand
if
he
is
little
does
it
matter
whether
he
is
young
or
old
or
deformed
poor
or
rich
in
any
case
he
is
contented
it
is
alone
which
is
so
to
speak
the
hard
cash
of
happiness
all
the
rest
is
but
the
and
in
making
this
observation
he
schopenhauer
is
careful
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
that
contributes
so
little
to
gayety
as
wealth
and
nothing
that
contributes
so
much
thereto
as
health
it
is
in
the
lower
classes
among
the
laborers
and
particularly
among
the
tillers
of
the
soil
that
gayety
and
contentment
are
to
be
found
while
on
the
other
hand
the
faces
of
the
great
and
the
rich
generally
present
an
expression
of
sullen
constraint
to
thoroughly
understand
however
how
greatly
happiness
depends
on
gayety
of
disposition
and
the
state
of
health
it
is
only
necessary
to
compare
the
impression
which
the
same
circumstances
and
similar
wants
bring
to
us
in
days
of
health
and
vigor
with
that
which
is
paramount
when
through
our
condition
we
are
predisposed
to
dullness
and
discontent
in
brief
it
is
not
the
event
itself
but
the
way
in
which
we
view
it
that
makes
or
unmakes
our
happiness
or
as
epictetus
said
long
ago
man
is
not
moved
by
things
but
by
his
opinion
of
them
as
a
general
rule
nine
tenths
of
happiness
may
be
said
to
rest
on
the
state
of
health
when
this
is
perfect
anything
and
everything
may
be
a
source
of
pleasure
in
illness
on
the
other
hand
nothing
no
matter
what
its
nature
may
be
is
capable
of
affording
any
real
enjoyment
it
follows
therefore
that
it
is
wanton
stupidity
to
sacrifice
health
for
any
purpose
even
for
wealth
and
fame
and
especially
to
passing
and
fugitive
pleasures
however
alluring
they
may
appear
the
next
class
of
possessions
of
which
schopenhauer
treats
is
property
and
in
considering
this
division
he
seems
not
unlike
that
contented
individual
who
on
seeing
a
quantity
of
objects
exposed
for
sale
exclaimed
pensively
how
much
there
is
of
which
i
have
no
need
every
man
it
will
be
admitted
has
his
own
horizon
beyond
which
his
pretensions
do
not
extend
they
reach
the
edge
but
they
do
not
cross
it
in
other
words
the
absence
of
those
possessions
with
which
a
man
is
unacquainted
is
in
no
sense
a
privation
to
him
and
it
is
probably
for
this
reason
that
the
bothers
himself
so
little
about
the
flaring
wealth
of
the
rich
wealth
on
the
other
hand
is
like
salt
water
the
more
one
drinks
the
greater
the
thirst
but
even
so
this
grim
philosopher
was
far
from
despising
it
it
is
a
rampart
against
an
incalculable
number
of
discomforts
and
it
is
in
this
manner
that
it
should
be
viewed
instead
of
being
considered
as
is
generally
the
case
in
the
light
of
a
permission
to
procure
a
diversity
of
pleasure
as
a
practical
man
schopenhauer
saw
nothing
that
could
make
his
ink
blush
in
repeatedly
recommending
the
preservation
of
a
fortune
made
or
inherited
for
even
he
says
if
it
simply
suffices
to
permit
its
possessor
to
live
without
the
necessity
of
labor
it
is
still
an
inappreciable
advantage
in
that
it
brings
with
it
an
exemption
from
the
general
drudgery
which
is
the
ordinary
lot
of
man
it
is
only
on
this
condition
that
man
is
born
free
master
of
his
hour
and
his
strength
and
enabled
to
say
each
morning
day
is
mine
the
difference
therefore
between
him
who
has
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
and
the
landlord
whose
runs
into
millions
is
infinitely
less
than
the
difference
between
the
first
and
the
man
who
has
nothing
if
the
man
whose
necessities
are
provided
for
is
inclined
to
follow
schopenhauer
advice
he
will
first
of
all
seek
in
repose
and
leisure
the
avoidance
of
every
form
of
discomfort
especially
will
he
seek
to
lead
a
tranquil
and
unpretentious
existence
which
so
far
as
possible
will
be
sheltered
from
all
intruders
after
having
for
a
certain
time
kept
up
relations
with
what
is
termed
the
world
he
will
prefer
a
retired
life
and
if
he
is
of
superior
intelligence
he
will
give
himself
up
to
solitude
this
he
will
do
because
the
more
a
man
possesses
in
himself
the
less
he
has
need
of
the
exterior
world
superiority
of
intelligence
will
therefore
lead
him
to
insociability
for
as
schopenhauer
says
it
is
precisely
in
solitude
where
each
of
us
is
dependent
on
his
own
resources
that
every
one
is
brought
face
to
face
with
his
own
individuality
there
the
imbecile
in
his
purple
groans
beneath
the
weight
of
his
miserable
self
while
he
who
is
mentally
gifted
peoples
and
animates
with
his
thoughts
the
most
arid
and
desert
region
now
it
may
be
objected
that
contentment
is
not
to
be
found
in
an
idle
folding
of
the
hands
behind
a
hedge
set
against
vexation
nor
is
this
schopenhauer
meaning
wealth
is
but
the
means
not
the
source
of
contentment
it
is
not
the
certainty
of
an
income
that
brings
happiness
for
its
accompanying
affranchisement
from
want
carries
the
tenant
to
the
opposite
pole
of
misery
where
gapes
the
hydra
ennui
and
it
is
there
that
he
whose
necessities
are
provided
for
surely
lands
unless
he
fills
the
hour
with
some
one
of
the
many
elevated
pursuits
from
which
those
who
are
obliged
to
work
for
their
bread
are
in
a
great
measure
debarred
the
third
and
last
class
of
possessions
that
schopenhauer
discusses
is
that
which
a
man
represents
or
in
other
words
the
manner
in
which
he
appears
to
his
neighbors
there
is
he
says
no
superstition
more
universally
dominant
than
that
which
leads
us
to
attach
a
high
value
to
the
opinion
of
others
and
whether
it
be
that
this
superstition
has
its
roots
in
our
very
nature
or
that
it
has
followed
us
up
from
the
birth
of
society
and
civilization
it
is
none
the
less
certain
that
it
influences
our
conduct
in
a
manner
which
is
incommensurate
and
hostile
to
our
this
influence
may
be
traced
from
the
point
in
which
it
shows
itself
beneath
the
anxious
and
servile
deference
to
the
to
that
in
which
it
drives
the
dagger
of
virginius
into
his
daughter
heart
or
else
to
where
it
leads
men
to
sacrifice
their
peace
their
fortune
their
wealth
and
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
posthumous
renown
the
existence
however
which
we
lead
in
the
minds
of
others
is
a
possession
schopenhauer
has
carefully
explained
which
through
a
singular
weakness
while
highly
prized
is
yet
entirely
unimportant
to
our
happiness
indeed
if
the
comparison
be
drawn
between
that
which
we
are
in
reality
and
that
which
we
are
in
the
eyes
of
others
it
will
be
seen
that
the
first
term
of
the
comparison
comprises
our
entire
existence
for
its
sphere
of
action
is
in
our
own
perceptions
while
on
the
other
hand
that
which
we
represent
acts
on
other
minds
than
our
own
and
in
consequence
has
no
direct
existence
for
us
and
an
indirect
one
only
so
far
as
it
may
influence
their
conduct
toward
us
the
wealthy
in
their
uttermost
magnificence
can
but
say
our
happiness
is
entirely
outside
of
us
it
dwells
in
the
minds
of
others
certainly
to
a
happiness
of
this
description
every
thinker
is
indifferent
or
will
necessarily
become
so
as
he
grows
aware
of
the
superficiality
and
dullness
of
mind
the
narrow
sentiments
and
limited
ideas
the
absurdity
of
opinion
and
numberless
errors
which
go
to
the
making
of
his
neighbor
brain
indeed
it
is
generally
sufficient
to
note
with
what
contempt
imbeciles
will
speak
of
some
distinguished
man
to
be
quite
ready
to
agree
with
schopenhauer
that
in
according
a
high
value
to
the
opinion
of
others
we
are
paying
them
an
honor
which
they
in
no
sense
deserve
it
is
essential
to
our
to
thoroughly
understand
the
simple
fact
that
each
one
lives
but
in
his
own
particular
skin
and
not
in
the
opinion
of
others
and
that
therefore
our
actual
condition
as
determined
by
health
temperament
intellect
wife
children
and
home
is
a
hundred
times
more
important
than
what
it
may
please
others
to
think
about
us
fame
of
course
is
very
pleasant
so
is
glory
but
after
all
what
do
they
amount
to
as
has
been
seen
leopardi
snapped
his
fingers
at
them
both
to
him
they
were
simply
illusions
schopenhauer
goes
more
deeply
into
the
subject
and
explains
with
great
opulence
of
detail
and
fantasy
of
adjective
that
glory
and
fame
are
founded
on
that
which
a
man
is
in
comparison
to
others
in
other
words
that
their
value
is
purely
relative
and
would
disappear
entirely
if
every
one
became
that
which
a
celebrity
is
already
it
is
not
fame
that
is
so
desirable
but
rather
the
merit
which
should
precede
it
the
predisposing
conditions
are
so
to
speak
the
substance
while
glory
itself
is
but
the
accident
which
works
on
its
possessor
as
an
exterior
symptom
and
confirms
his
own
high
opinion
of
himself
but
this
symptom
is
yet
not
infallible
for
is
there
not
glory
without
merit
and
merit
without
fame
as
glory
is
incontestably
but
the
echo
the
image
the
shadow
the
simulachre
of
merit
and
as
in
any
case
that
which
is
admirable
should
be
more
highly
valued
than
the
admiration
that
it
excites
it
follows
that
that
which
causes
happiness
does
not
consist
in
glory
but
rather
in
the
attracting
force
of
merit
or
to
put
it
more
exactly
in
the
possession
of
such
character
and
faculties
as
predispose
thereto
to
be
deserving
of
fame
is
then
its
own
exceeding
great
reward
there
all
the
honor
lies
and
necessarily
this
must
be
true
for
as
a
rule
the
reverberation
of
a
glory
that
is
to
echo
through
future
ages
rarely
reaches
the
ears
of
him
who
is
the
object
and
though
certain
instances
to
the
contrary
may
be
objected
yet
they
have
usually
been
due
to
fortuitous
circumstances
which
are
otherwise
without
great
importance
men
lack
ordinarily
the
proper
balance
of
judgment
which
is
necessary
for
the
appreciation
of
superior
productions
and
in
these
matters
they
usually
take
the
opinion
of
others
and
that
too
in
such
wise
that
admirers
out
of
a
hundred
accord
their
praise
at
the
nod
of
one
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
approbation
of
contemporaries
however
numerous
their
voices
may
be
has
so
slight
a
value
for
the
thinker
for
at
best
he
can
hearken
to
the
voices
of
the
few
which
in
themselves
may
be
but
the
effect
of
the
moment
would
a
virtuoso
be
greatly
flattered
by
the
applause
of
his
public
if
he
learned
that
with
but
two
or
three
exceptions
the
auditorium
was
filled
with
deaf
mutes
who
to
conceal
their
infirmity
clapped
a
loud
approval
so
soon
as
they
saw
a
real
listener
move
his
hands
and
how
would
it
be
if
he
knew
the
leaders
of
the
clique
were
often
paid
to
procure
a
great
success
to
the
most
insignificant
scraper
of
it
is
with
reflections
of
this
description
that
schopenhauer
explains
why
it
is
that
sudden
celebrity
so
rarely
passes
into
immortal
glory
and
points
how
hard
it
is
to
climb
the
heights
where
fame
proud
temple
shines
afar
and
even
the
summit
gained
the
uselessness
of
it
all
this
same
conclusion
has
been
reached
by
several
other
writers
notably
by
leopardi
whose
views
have
been
already
explained
and
by
von
hartmann
whose
theories
are
mentioned
in
the
next
chapter
but
the
main
idea
has
perhaps
been
best
expressed
by
who
in
speaking
of
the
temple
of
fame
says
its
interior
is
inhabited
only
by
the
dead
who
were
not
there
in
their
and
by
certain
aspirants
who
are
shown
the
door
as
soon
as
they
die
to
sum
up
what
schopenhauer
has
set
forth
and
of
which
the
foregoing
detached
ideas
can
give
at
best
but
a
lame
conception
we
find
that
to
his
mind
as
perhaps
to
that
of
every
serious
thinker
the
first
and
most
essential
condition
of
contentment
is
the
quality
of
character
and
this
would
be
essential
if
only
because
it
is
always
in
action
but
it
is
so
even
to
a
greater
extent
because
it
is
the
only
possession
which
can
not
in
some
manner
be
taken
from
us
in
this
sense
he
considers
its
value
as
absolute
when
opposed
to
the
relative
value
of
mere
possessions
and
the
opinion
of
others
in
brief
man
is
not
so
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
the
exterior
world
as
it
is
generally
supposed
for
only
time
can
exercise
his
sovereign
rights
upon
him
beneath
this
force
the
physical
and
intellectual
qualities
wane
and
gradually
succumb
the
moral
character
alone
remaining
invulnerable
considered
in
this
connection
actual
possessions
and
the
opinions
which
others
hold
concerning
us
have
this
advantage
over
character
they
need
not
necessarily
be
affected
by
time
moreover
being
accessible
in
their
nature
they
both
may
be
acquired
while
on
the
other
hand
character
once
established
remains
invariable
for
life
schopenhauer
evidently
does
not
hold
with
him
who
sings
that
men
may
rise
on
of
their
dead
selves
to
higher
things
all
that
can
be
done
he
has
explained
is
to
employ
the
individuality
such
as
it
is
to
the
greatest
profit
or
in
other
words
a
man
should
pursue
only
those
aspirations
which
correspond
to
his
disposition
and
only
choose
in
consequence
that
occupation
and
walk
of
life
which
is
best
suited
to
it
from
the
preponderance
thus
given
to
the
first
of
these
three
divisions
over
the
two
others
it
follows
that
it
is
far
better
to
watch
over
health
and
the
development
of
the
intellect
than
it
is
to
attend
to
the
acquisition
of
wealth
schopenhauer
of
course
does
not
mean
that
the
acquisition
of
that
which
is
necessary
to
one
proper
maintenance
should
be
in
any
wise
neglected
far
from
it
his
idea
is
simply
that
a
superfluity
of
riches
instead
of
contributing
to
brings
with
it
an
inevitable
vexation
in
the
constant
care
which
the
management
of
a
large
fortune
demands
briefly
then
the
essential
element
of
contentment
is
that
which
one
is
in
himself
and
it
is
simply
because
the
dose
is
ordinarily
so
small
that
the
majority
of
those
who
have
been
conquerors
in
the
struggle
with
want
feel
themselves
to
be
as
thoroughly
unhappy
as
those
who
are
still
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
but
still
whatever
the
issue
of
the
conflict
may
be
each
one
among
us
is
enjoined
to
aspire
to
a
good
repute
honor
is
an
inappreciable
belonging
and
glory
the
most
exquisite
of
all
that
is
within
the
reach
of
man
is
the
golden
fleece
of
the
elect
the
second
and
third
divisions
have
upon
each
other
a
reciprocal
effect
wealth
brings
with
it
the
good
opinion
of
others
and
the
good
opinion
of
others
has
aided
many
a
man
on
the
road
to
fortune
taken
together
they
represent
over
again
the
of
petronius
yet
the
factors
that
reside
within
us
contribute
more
liberally
to
contentment
than
those
which
are
born
of
things
it
is
somewhat
in
this
manner
but
with
a
conciseness
of
deduction
and
a
felicity
of
diction
which
the
foregoing
summary
is
inadequate
even
to
suggest
that
schopenhauer
without
any
noticeable
effort
points
quietly
and
with
a
certain
suavity
of
to
the
fact
that
there
is
in
spite
of
all
our
bluster
and
hurrying
about
very
little
in
life
that
is
of
much
consequence
there
is
of
course
little
that
is
terrifying
in
what
he
has
written
there
is
no
incentive
and
no
stimulus
as
the
phrase
goes
to
be
up
and
doing
indeed
to
the
reflective
mind
his
logic
will
have
somewhat
the
effect
of
a
sedative
and
to
many
he
will
seem
to
hold
that
the
best
use
life
can
be
put
to
is
to
pass
it
in
a
sort
of
dilettante
quietism
such
in
the
main
is
his
idea
but
it
is
an
idea
which
to
be
acted
upon
necessitates
a
refinement
of
the
senses
and
a
burnish
of
the
intellect
such
as
is
possessed
but
by
the
few
and
consequently
the
fear
of
its
general
adoption
need
cause
but
small
alarm
it
may
be
remembered
that
beyond
the
surface
of
things
here
examined
he
pointed
in
another
essay
to
the
influence
of
morality
on
general
happiness
and
recommended
the
practice
of
charity
forbearance
and
good
will
to
all
men
as
one
of
the
first
conditions
of
mental
content
against
all
this
naturally
many
objections
might
be
raised
and
several
ameliorations
could
be
suggested
but
in
the
main
the
teaching
has
a
certain
sound
value
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
talk
away
champfort
has
said
happiness
is
no
easy
matter
it
is
hard
to
find
it
within
us
and
impossible
to
find
it
elsewhere
and
this
aphorism
with
which
schopenhauer
decked
his
served
pretty
much
as
keynote
to
the
whole
essay
all
the
way
through
he
has
insisted
that
the
prime
essential
is
what
one
in
one
self
that
is
in
character
and
disposition
but
not
wealth
nor
yet
the
esteem
of
others
these
it
is
true
are
pleasing
additions
but
not
the
qua
wealth
however
is
too
greatly
prized
to
suffer
from
a
theoretic
treatment
any
appreciable
diminution
in
general
esteem
and
there
are
necessarily
few
who
will
object
to
it
because
they
are
told
it
is
an
extra
burden
perhaps
schopenhauer
would
not
have
turned
his
back
upon
it
either
had
he
been
put
to
the
test
but
as
he
escaped
that
the
conjecture
is
comparatively
useless
still
few
men
can
eat
two
dinners
and
those
who
have
that
capacity
are
seldom
objects
of
envy
even
to
the
disciples
of
baron
brisse
the
dinners
may
stand
of
course
for
figurative
repasts
and
according
to
schopenhauer
if
a
man
has
enough
a
superfluity
is
not
only
unnecessary
but
may
readily
resolve
itself
into
a
cause
of
vexation
certainly
as
schiller
said
we
are
all
born
in
arcadia
that
is
we
enter
life
fully
persuaded
that
happiness
exists
and
that
it
is
most
easy
to
make
acquaintance
with
it
but
generally
speaking
experience
soon
lets
us
know
that
happiness
is
a
will
o
the
wisp
which
is
only
visible
from
afar
while
on
the
other
hand
suffering
and
pain
have
a
reality
so
insistent
that
they
present
themselves
not
only
at
once
and
unexpectedly
but
without
any
of
the
flimsiness
of
illusion
in
schopenhauer
view
the
best
the
world
has
to
offer
is
an
existence
of
painless
tranquillity
pleasures
are
and
always
will
be
negative
and
to
consider
them
otherwise
is
a
mistake
which
brings
its
own
punishment
with
it
pain
on
the
contrary
is
positive
and
it
is
in
its
absence
that
the
ladder
to
possible
contentment
may
be
found
if
then
from
a
condition
of
this
description
viz
one
which
is
devoid
of
pain
boredom
be
also
subtracted
then
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
earthly
happiness
and
that
anything
that
lies
beyond
belongs
to
the
domain
of
pure
chimera
in
the
chapter
succeeding
the
one
just
considered
schopenhauer
added
certain
reflections
on
the
proper
conduct
of
life
which
though
loose
and
unsystematic
are
yet
peculiarly
fertile
in
suggestion
and
entirely
free
from
the
more
or
less
accentuated
platitudes
with
which
other
writers
have
dulled
the
subject
in
this
essay
he
holds
that
the
supreme
rule
of
earthly
wisdom
is
contained
in
aristotle
dictum
that
the
sage
will
seek
to
dwell
where
pain
is
not
and
not
where
pleasure
is
the
truth
of
this
axiom
he
establishes
by
a
constant
reiteration
of
his
favorite
theory
that
pleasure
as
well
as
happiness
is
negative
and
only
pain
is
real
now
other
writers
particularly
james
sully
and
herr
von
hartmann
have
rebelled
against
this
statement
but
the
force
of
their
arguments
has
not
been
strong
enough
to
confute
it
indeed
mere
logic
can
make
no
man
contented
and
in
any
event
if
a
philosopher
considers
pleasure
as
a
negative
condition
and
the
critic
prefers
to
look
upon
it
in
a
different
light
the
student
is
no
more
bound
to
agree
with
the
one
than
with
the
other
he
will
if
properly
advised
draw
his
conclusions
from
his
own
sensations
in
accordance
with
the
best
views
however
schopenhauer
is
right
and
his
critics
wrong
a
homely
example
which
he
suggests
may
perhaps
serve
to
set
the
matter
straight
when
we
are
in
perfect
health
and
there
is
but
one
little
painful
spot
somewhere
for
instance
an
aching
tooth
or
a
swollen
finger
our
otherwise
perfect
health
is
unnoticed
and
our
attention
is
directed
entirely
to
the
pain
we
are
experiencing
while
pleasure
determined
as
always
by
the
totality
of
the
sensations
is
entirely
effaced
in
the
same
manner
when
everything
in
which
we
are
interested
is
going
as
we
wish
save
one
thing
which
is
going
the
wrong
way
it
is
this
particular
thing
that
is
constantly
in
our
mind
and
not
the
other
and
more
important
matters
which
are
giving
us
no
concern
schopenhauer
advice
therefore
is
that
attention
should
not
be
directed
to
the
pleasures
of
life
but
to
the
means
by
which
its
innumerable
evils
may
best
be
escaped
if
this
recommendation
is
not
sound
then
voltaire
aphorism
happiness
is
but
a
dream
and
only
pain
is
real
is
as
false
in
appearance
as
it
is
correct
in
reality
whoever
then
would
draw
up
a
balance
sheet
of
pleasure
and
pain
should
not
base
the
sum
total
on
the
amount
of
pleasures
which
he
has
enjoyed
but
rather
in
accordance
with
the
pains
which
he
has
avoided
for
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
life
at
best
is
not
given
to
us
to
be
enjoyed
but
to
be
endured
and
the
happiest
man
is
therefore
he
who
has
wandered
through
life
with
the
smallest
burden
of
physical
and
mental
suffering
and
not
he
to
whom
the
most
vivid
delights
and
intensest
joys
have
been
accorded
in
any
case
the
greatest
piece
of
stupidity
of
which
man
can
be
guilty
is
to
wish
to
transform
his
theatre
of
misery
into
a
and
to
attempt
to
seek
happiness
therein
instead
of
trying
as
he
should
to
avert
as
many
pains
as
possible
there
are
of
course
many
who
are
foolish
enough
not
to
take
this
view
of
life
but
according
to
schopenhauer
those
who
do
not
do
so
are
much
more
at
fault
than
those
who
with
excess
of
precaution
look
upon
the
world
as
a
burning
pit
and
occupy
themselves
to
the
best
of
their
ability
in
procuring
a
dwelling
the
simpleton
will
always
run
after
pleasure
and
the
pessimist
will
do
all
he
can
to
give
pain
a
wide
berth
if
in
spite
of
his
efforts
the
success
of
the
latter
is
small
the
fault
is
not
so
much
his
as
that
of
fate
and
if
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
he
has
taken
a
very
roundabout
way
and
uselessly
sacrificed
any
amount
of
possible
pleasures
without
any
appreciable
benefit
he
can
at
least
take
heart
again
in
the
knowledge
that
he
has
in
reality
lost
nothing
at
all
for
the
possible
pleasures
are
such
pure
chimeras
that
it
is
simply
childish
to
grieve
about
them
it
is
schopenhauer
says
because
this
mistake
is
so
frequently
made
in
favor
of
optimism
that
such
a
number
of
misfortunes
occur
for
in
those
moments
that
we
are
free
from
discomfort
disquieting
desires
dazzle
our
eyes
with
the
illusions
of
an
unreal
yet
seductive
happiness
and
lure
us
on
to
a
suffering
which
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
then
indeed
do
we
grieve
over
the
lost
estate
which
was
exempt
from
pain
as
over
a
paradise
on
which
we
have
wittingly
turned
the
key
in
this
way
it
seems
as
though
some
evil
spirit
was
constantly
working
a
deceptive
mirage
to
draw
us
from
that
freedom
from
pain
which
is
the
supreme
and
only
real
happiness
now
the
average
young
man
is
usually
possessed
of
some
vague
conviction
that
the
world
stretching
out
before
him
to
unseen
limits
is
the
seat
of
a
tangible
happiness
which
only
escapes
those
who
are
not
clever
enough
to
grasp
it
this
conviction
moreover
is
strengthened
by
romance
and
verse
and
by
that
hypocrisy
which
leads
the
world
always
by
the
thread
of
exterior
appearance
ever
after
his
life
is
a
more
or
less
prudently
conducted
hunt
a
chase
for
a
fictitious
game
until
at
last
with
a
round
turn
he
is
pulled
up
face
to
face
with
disenchantment
and
finds
that
the
infinite
vistas
narrow
down
to
a
dark
alley
with
a
dead
wall
at
the
end
on
the
other
hand
the
careful
observer
of
men
and
things
will
mark
a
protest
on
his
own
existence
he
will
have
no
great
hopes
and
but
few
regrets
plato
long
ago
said
there
is
nothing
in
life
worth
a
struggle
and
to
this
maxim
schopenhauer
ideal
reader
will
attune
his
days
and
in
any
variations
he
may
attempt
keep
always
to
the
minor
key
the
chief
difficulty
however
which
the
candidate
in
pessimism
will
encounter
in
his
first
attempt
to
practice
the
foregoing
recommendations
is
that
which
is
raised
by
the
hypocrisy
of
the
world
to
which
allusion
has
been
already
made
and
yet
in
teaching
the
most
practical
lesson
that
can
be
given
to
youth
is
the
showing
up
of
the
whole
thing
for
the
sham
that
it
is
the
splendors
are
merest
tinsel
he
says
the
essence
of
the
thing
is
lacking
the
fêtes
the
balls
the
illuminations
the
music
are
but
the
banners
the
indications
the
hieroglyphics
of
joy
yet
as
a
rule
joy
is
absent
it
alone
has
sent
a
regret
when
it
does
present
itself
it
comes
ordinarily
without
invitation
and
unannounced
it
enters
in
the
simplest
manner
often
for
the
most
trivial
reason
and
under
circumstances
that
are
insignificant
like
the
gold
in
australia
it
is
spread
about
here
and
there
according
to
the
whim
of
hazard
without
law
or
rule
generally
in
small
particles
and
but
seldom
in
an
appreciable
quantity
this
certainly
can
not
be
termed
an
enthusiastic
view
of
life
nor
for
that
matter
is
it
intended
to
be
so
considered
there
was
too
much
unreasoning
enthusiasm
schopenhauer
thought
and
too
much
unwary
skating
over
thin
surfaces
and
it
was
precisely
for
this
reason
that
he
set
about
painting
danger
in
the
biggest
and
characters
if
his
advice
therefore
is
not
always
cheerful
it
is
at
least
practical
and
in
any
event
no
one
can
go
far
astray
in
following
the
monitory
which
he
was
the
first
to
erect
the
wayfarer
who
takes
them
for
guidance
may
perhaps
stand
still
but
at
least
he
will
not
stumble
into
any
artificial
pitfalls
or
happen
upon
unexpected
quagmires
in
treating
of
our
conduct
to
ourselves
schopenhauer
lays
much
stress
on
the
recommendation
that
such
proportion
be
preserved
between
the
attention
which
we
give
to
the
present
and
that
which
we
grant
to
the
future
that
the
one
will
in
nowise
interfere
with
the
other
as
there
are
many
who
live
for
the
hour
and
many
who
live
for
the
future
the
right
measure
is
seldom
attained
but
as
schopenhauer
points
out
the
future
like
the
past
has
a
value
which
is
more
apparent
than
real
it
is
the
present
that
is
actual
it
is
the
present
that
is
certain
while
the
future
on
the
contrary
usually
turns
out
in
a
manner
totally
different
from
our
expectation
the
distance
which
robes
the
mountains
expands
them
in
our
thoughts
but
the
present
alone
is
true
and
effective
and
as
it
is
therein
that
our
existence
exclusively
rests
it
should
not
only
be
hospitably
received
but
every
hour
that
is
free
from
vexation
or
pain
should
be
enjoyed
to
the
fullest
extent
and
not
saddened
with
the
memory
of
irrecoverable
hopes
or
darkened
by
apprehensions
of
the
morrow
in
other
words
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
and
for
the
moment
take
seneca
for
model
and
agree
with
him
that
each
day
separately
is
a
separate
life
as
for
the
future
it
rests
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
the
only
misfortunes
concerning
which
we
should
alarm
ourselves
are
those
that
are
inevitable
but
then
after
all
how
many
are
there
of
this
nature
misfortunes
broadly
considered
are
either
possible
and
probable
or
else
certain
though
in
the
indefinite
future
and
if
we
bother
ourselves
over
all
that
come
to
pass
we
would
never
enjoy
a
moment
repose
in
order
therefore
that
tranquillity
may
not
be
unnecessarily
disturbed
schopenhauer
advises
that
possible
misfortunes
be
looked
upon
as
though
they
would
never
occur
and
inevitable
misfortunes
as
though
they
were
still
far
distant
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
blind
who
of
all
people
are
usually
pitied
as
the
most
unfortunate
possess
as
a
class
the
calmest
and
most
contented
expression
this
phenomenon
may
serve
as
some
corroboration
of
a
theory
which
schopenhauer
expands
at
great
length
that
the
narrower
the
circle
of
vision
the
greater
the
happiness
and
conversely
the
wider
it
is
the
greater
the
inquietude
and
torment
it
is
then
in
the
simplicity
and
uniformity
of
life
so
long
of
course
as
it
does
not
engender
weariness
of
mind
that
the
greatest
measure
of
happiness
is
to
be
found
under
conditions
of
this
description
which
every
poet
from
horace
to
joaquin
miller
has
more
or
less
praised
the
burden
from
which
life
is
inseparable
is
borne
most
lightly
and
existence
flows
like
a
rivulet
without
tides
or
waves
the
claims
of
society
the
effort
to
keep
in
the
swim
le
as
the
french
say
is
not
of
course
very
conducive
to
the
tranquil
contentment
which
is
here
so
earnestly
commended
schopenhauer
has
much
to
say
on
the
subject
as
a
recluse
he
necessarily
judged
the
world
and
as
necessarily
found
it
wanting
indeed
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
he
held
in
utter
contempt
the
entire
machinery
of
fashion
and
looked
upon
the
whole
thing
as
a
toy
for
imbeciles
to
say
that
he
hated
it
would
be
unjust
for
like
most
sensible
people
he
held
hatred
to
be
an
elixir
far
too
precious
to
be
wasted
on
trivial
matters
he
simply
took
up
society
and
then
let
it
drop
and
he
did
so
not
because
it
soiled
his
gloves
but
because
it
did
not
seem
worth
the
holding
such
views
as
he
cared
to
express
on
this
subject
are
unmarked
by
any
striking
vividness
of
originality
for
the
most
part
they
are
simple
observations
as
pertinent
to
europe
half
a
century
ago
as
to
contemporary
london
and
new
york
and
imply
briefly
that
society
is
a
mill
of
the
conventional
which
grinds
individualities
into
a
tiresome
sameness
of
sample
individuality
was
like
a
into
which
schopenhauer
placed
all
his
valuables
and
to
which
we
are
led
to
believe
he
clung
with
all
his
might
and
main
rather
than
have
it
tampered
with
he
carried
it
off
to
a
hermitage
and
kept
it
there
one
might
say
in
cotton
it
may
be
however
that
the
underlying
reason
of
the
sombre
obliqueness
with
which
he
viewed
the
world
at
large
sprang
from
a
cause
which
was
natural
if
commonplace
it
did
not
appreciate
him
nor
is
this
very
surprising
society
as
a
rule
has
an
immense
fund
of
appreciation
which
it
lavishes
liberally
on
every
merit
save
alone
that
of
intellectual
ability
on
this
it
looks
askant
or
as
schopenhauer
says
as
if
it
were
smuggled
furthermore
he
goes
on
to
say
good
society
so
called
not
only
brings
one
in
contact
with
a
lot
of
people
whom
he
can
neither
approve
of
nor
like
but
it
will
not
permit
us
to
be
ourselves
to
be
such
as
our
nature
demands
on
the
contrary
it
compels
us
that
we
may
remain
on
the
same
diapason
with
the
rest
to
shrivel
up
completely
and
even
at
times
to
appear
deformed
wit
and
repartee
are
admittedly
out
of
place
save
among
one
peers
in
ordinary
society
such
manifestations
are
either
not
understood
or
looked
upon
as
dreadfully
bad
form
for
that
matter
it
is
only
the
novice
who
thinks
that
brilliant
conversational
powers
will
serve
as
passport
as
a
rule
it
does
nothing
of
the
sort
rather
does
it
excite
among
the
majority
a
feeling
nearly
akin
to
hatred
and
which
is
all
the
more
bitter
because
it
must
be
concealed
ordinarily
schopenhauer
says
when
two
people
are
talking
together
so
soon
as
one
of
them
notices
a
great
superiority
on
the
part
of
the
other
he
tacitly
concludes
and
without
definite
reason
for
so
doing
that
his
own
inferiority
has
been
noticed
by
his
companion
for
whom
he
immediately
conceives
a
blind
resentment
even
a
violent
dislike
nor
in
this
is
he
much
to
be
blamed
for
what
is
a
display
of
wit
and
judgment
but
an
accusation
to
others
of
their
own
commonplace
stupidity
and
dullness
to
please
in
society
therefore
one
needs
to
be
or
ignorant
and
it
is
precisely
those
who
are
the
one
or
the
other
or
even
both
who
are
welcome
and
well
received
from
schopenhauer
standpoint
then
the
society
that
is
worth
the
trouble
of
cultivating
is
not
such
as
is
told
of
in
the
morning
papers
the
the
the
of
every
class
and
denomination
were
to
him
mentally
insolvent
and
unable
to
offer
any
indemnity
for
the
boredom
and
fatigue
which
their
reunions
and
conversation
created
to
be
socially
inclined
was
to
him
irrefutable
evidence
of
a
vacuous
mind
and
with
some
of
that
grim
humor
which
characterized
much
of
his
work
he
compared
the
modern
assembly
to
that
russian
orchestra
which
composed
of
horns
that
have
but
one
note
apiece
is
harmonious
only
through
the
exact
coincidence
of
each
instrument
taken
separately
each
one
is
appallingly
monotonous
and
it
is
only
in
conjunction
with
others
that
they
amount
to
anything
at
all
so
it
is
he
finds
with
the
majority
of
people
individually
they
seem
to
have
but
one
thought
and
are
in
consequence
both
tiresome
and
sociable
there
is
a
tolerably
familiar
anecdote
of
louis
which
represents
that
feeble
monarch
as
hailing
one
of
his
officers
with
the
bland
suggestion
that
they
should
wile
away
the
hour
in
common
boredom
venez
monsieur
run
the
historic
words
allons
nous
ennuyer
ensemble
and
it
is
perhaps
this
but
unanalyzed
motive
which
leads
so
many
to
ease
their
weariness
in
the
companionship
of
their
fellows
for
after
all
it
can
not
but
be
admitted
that
the
most
gregarious
seek
the
presence
of
others
and
even
of
those
for
whom
they
care
nothing
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
society
as
to
get
away
from
themselves
and
the
dull
monotone
of
an
empty
head
such
at
any
rate
is
schopenhauer
idea
and
he
is
careful
in
pointing
to
the
retired
existence
of
all
really
distinguished
thinkers
to
note
that
the
desire
for
companionship
is
not
derived
from
a
love
of
society
but
from
a
fear
of
solitude
and
that
so
soon
as
the
latter
is
mastered
there
is
no
further
desire
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
the
only
society
therefore
that
is
worth
the
trouble
of
cultivation
is
that
of
one
own
self
in
this
schopenhauer
apparently
makes
no
exception
however
closely
the
bonds
of
love
or
friendship
may
be
woven
there
is
always
some
clash
of
temperament
an
echoless
shock
it
may
be
but
to
nerves
properly
attuned
none
the
less
unpleasant
in
regard
to
the
society
of
the
distinguished
thinkers
of
whose
conspicuous
solitude
he
makes
constant
parade
nothing
is
said
but
it
is
perhaps
allowable
to
suppose
that
genius
when
it
does
descend
from
its
lofty
seclusion
quickly
tires
of
giving
giving
always
without
return
and
on
its
summits
fraternizes
as
seldom
with
its
peers
as
kings
do
with
their
equals
in
brief
then
the
sociability
of
man
is
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
his
intellectual
value
and
to
say
of
some
one
he
is
not
at
all
sociable
may
be
generally
taken
to
mean
he
is
a
man
of
great
ability
the
praises
of
solitude
have
been
written
over
and
over
again
almost
all
the
essayists
and
most
of
the
poets
have
expatiated
more
or
less
volubly
on
its
charms
but
no
one
has
entered
so
thoroughly
into
the
core
of
the
subject
as
did
this
spectacled
misanthrope
emerson
has
told
a
quaint
little
story
of
a
friend
who
took
an
exquisite
delight
in
thinking
of
the
incalculable
number
of
places
where
he
was
not
and
whose
idea
of
felicity
was
to
dwell
far
off
somewhere
among
the
back
stars
there
to
wear
out
ages
in
solitude
and
forget
memory
itself
had
schopenhauer
known
this
gentleman
he
would
have
loved
him
though
perhaps
at
a
distance
as
it
was
he
expressed
an
approval
that
was
rapturous
of
la
bruyère
axiom
all
our
misfortunes
come
from
an
inability
to
be
alone
and
at
measured
intervals
repeated
voltaire
maxim
that
the
world
is
full
of
people
who
are
not
worth
speaking
to
his
own
ideas
on
the
subject
savor
highly
of
the
epigrammatic
solitude
he
says
offers
a
double
advantage
to
the
thinker
the
first
in
being
with
himself
the
second
in
not
being
with
others
the
love
of
solitude
however
can
not
be
considered
otherwise
than
as
an
acquired
taste
it
must
come
as
the
result
of
experience
and
reflection
and
advance
with
the
development
of
the
intellect
as
well
as
with
the
progress
of
age
a
child
will
cry
with
fright
if
it
be
left
alone
even
for
a
moment
in
boyhood
solitude
is
a
severe
penance
young
men
are
eminently
sociable
and
it
is
only
the
more
elevated
among
them
who
from
time
to
time
wander
off
by
themselves
but
even
so
a
day
passed
in
strict
seclusion
is
no
easy
matter
in
middle
age
it
is
not
so
difficult
while
to
the
aged
solitude
seems
the
natural
element
but
in
each
individual
separately
considered
the
growth
of
the
inclination
for
solitude
is
always
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the
intellect
and
according
to
schopenhauer
it
is
never
thoroughly
matured
until
the
individual
becomes
firmly
convinced
that
society
is
the
most
disagreeable
of
all
the
unpleasant
things
in
the
world
to
this
conclusion
both
petrarch
and
zimmerman
came
in
their
respective
works
on
solitude
chamfort
says
somewhere
very
wittily
it
is
sometimes
said
of
a
man
that
he
lives
alone
and
does
not
care
for
society
this
is
very
much
the
same
as
saying
that
he
does
not
care
for
exercise
because
he
does
not
make
excursions
at
night
in
the
forest
of
bondy
in
short
all
those
whom
prometheus
has
fashioned
from
his
finer
clay
have
brought
testimony
of
like
purport
to
schopenhauer
a
desire
for
solitude
was
a
sure
indication
of
aristocratic
tastes
every
blackguard
he
says
is
pitiably
sociable
but
true
nobility
is
detected
in
the
man
who
finds
no
pleasure
in
the
companionship
of
others
and
who
in
preferring
solitude
to
society
gradually
acquires
the
conviction
that
save
in
rare
exceptions
there
is
little
choice
between
isolation
and
vulgarity
angelus
silesius
whose
name
has
descended
to
us
in
a
halo
of
christian
tenderness
bears
witness
to
the
truth
of
this
theory
though
solitude
is
hard
yet
the
refined
will
still
in
place
a
desert
find
it
is
especially
in
old
age
when
one
has
ceased
to
expect
anything
in
particular
from
the
generality
of
mankind
when
one
has
become
pretty
well
satisfied
that
in
the
long
run
men
do
not
improve
on
acquaintance
and
when
one
is
usually
divested
of
those
illusions
which
make
the
companionship
of
others
seem
desirable
it
is
at
this
period
that
the
taste
for
solitude
which
heretofore
has
demanded
a
succession
of
struggles
becomes
at
once
natural
and
matter
of
fact
one
feels
then
as
much
at
ease
therein
as
the
fish
does
at
high
water
but
in
spite
of
the
advantages
of
solitude
there
is
a
hackneyed
proverb
about
the
rose
and
the
thorn
which
has
here
a
most
direct
application
in
the
same
manner
that
every
breath
of
frosty
air
injuriously
affects
any
one
who
constantly
keeps
to
his
own
room
so
does
a
disposition
become
so
sensitive
in
solitude
that
he
is
vexed
and
annoyed
at
the
most
trivial
incident
at
a
word
or
even
at
an
expression
of
the
countenance
it
is
hard
however
to
catch
schopenhauer
napping
and
for
this
he
has
a
remedy
which
if
not
within
the
reach
of
all
is
none
the
less
efficacious
his
recipe
is
simply
that
every
aspirant
should
accustom
himself
to
carry
a
part
of
his
solitude
into
society
and
learn
to
be
alone
even
in
a
crowd
in
other
words
not
to
tell
others
at
once
what
he
thinks
and
not
to
pay
much
attention
to
what
others
may
say
in
this
way
he
will
in
a
measure
keep
himself
unaffected
by
the
stupidities
which
must
necessarily
surge
about
him
and
harden
himself
to
exterior
influences
as
has
been
noted
it
was
far
from
schopenhauer
intention
to
recommend
an
idle
folding
of
the
hands
solitude
is
all
very
well
but
to
be
habitable
it
must
be
peopled
with
thoughts
and
deeds
the
essence
of
life
is
movement
and
in
inaction
it
is
a
most
difficult
thing
to
be
tranquil
indeed
the
most
thoughtless
must
do
something
even
if
that
something
consist
but
in
a
tattoo
beaten
on
the
schopenhauer
words
however
are
presumably
not
addressed
to
thoughtless
people
to
struggle
and
cope
is
he
says
as
much
of
a
necessity
to
man
as
burrowing
is
to
the
mole
to
conquer
resistance
constitutes
the
fullness
of
human
delight
and
whether
the
obstacles
are
of
a
material
nature
as
in
action
and
exercise
or
purely
mental
as
in
study
and
research
it
is
the
combat
and
the
victory
that
bring
happiness
with
them
in
treating
of
our
conduct
to
others
schopenhauer
seems
always
to
be
peering
down
and
sounding
bottom
in
unfathomed
depths
of
the
human
heart
and
to
be
taking
measure
of
those
crevices
and
sinuosities
for
which
balzac
and
la
rochefoucauld
with
all
their
equipment
of
bitterness
possessed
no
adequate
compass
the
result
of
his
soundings
and
measurements
is
a
lesson
of
circumspection
and
indulgence
of
which
the
first
stands
as
guarantee
against
prejudice
and
the
second
as
shelter
from
quarrels
and
disputes
machiavelli
warned
every
one
to
as
carefully
avoid
an
injury
to
the
of
an
inferior
as
one
would
the
commission
of
a
crime
schopenhauer
goes
even
further
his
theory
is
that
whoever
is
obliged
to
live
among
his
fellows
should
never
repulse
any
one
however
pitiful
wicked
or
ridiculous
his
character
may
be
on
the
contrary
he
should
accept
him
as
something
immutable
and
consider
that
there
must
necessarily
be
some
one
of
that
class
too
if
he
does
otherwise
he
commits
not
only
an
imprudence
but
provokes
a
enmity
for
after
all
no
one
can
modify
his
own
character
and
if
a
man
is
condemned
unreservedly
there
is
of
necessity
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
declare
war
to
the
knife
it
is
for
this
reason
that
when
one
wishes
or
is
obliged
to
live
among
his
it
becomes
necessary
to
let
each
one
work
out
his
own
nature
and
accept
each
individual
as
he
stands
the
most
that
can
be
done
is
to
attempt
to
utilize
the
qualities
and
dispositions
of
each
so
far
as
they
may
be
adaptable
but
in
no
case
is
a
man
to
be
condemned
purely
and
simply
for
what
he
is
this
is
the
true
signification
of
the
dictum
live
and
let
live
meanwhile
in
learning
how
to
treat
others
it
will
not
come
amiss
schopenhauer
goes
on
to
say
to
exercise
a
little
patience
on
any
of
the
inanimate
objects
which
in
virtue
of
some
physical
or
mechanical
necessity
obstinately
annoy
and
thwart
us
every
day
for
in
so
doing
we
learn
to
bestow
on
our
fellows
the
patience
already
acquired
and
in
this
manner
become
accustomed
to
the
thought
that
they
too
whenever
they
form
an
obstacle
to
our
wishes
do
so
because
they
can
not
help
it
in
virtue
of
a
natural
law
which
is
as
rigorous
as
that
which
acts
on
inanimate
things
and
because
it
is
as
absurd
to
get
angry
with
them
as
to
be
annoyed
at
the
stone
which
slips
between
our
feet
but
in
all
this
schopenhauer
is
far
from
recommending
any
or
excess
of
amiability
for
he
readily
recognizes
that
the
majority
of
people
are
like
children
who
become
pert
as
soon
as
they
are
spoiled
refuse
a
loan
to
a
friend
he
says
and
you
will
not
lose
him
as
readily
as
you
would
if
you
had
advanced
the
money
in
the
same
manner
a
trace
of
haughtiness
and
indifference
on
your
part
will
generally
quell
any
of
those
preliminary
symptoms
of
arrogance
that
follow
upon
too
much
kindness
indeed
it
is
the
idea
that
one
has
need
of
them
that
few
men
can
bear
they
become
presumptuous
at
once
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
there
are
so
few
with
whom
one
can
be
really
intimate
most
especially
should
we
avoid
any
familiarity
with
vulgar
natures
if
by
chance
an
inferior
imagines
for
a
moment
that
i
have
more
need
of
him
than
he
has
of
me
he
will
suddenly
act
as
though
i
had
stolen
something
from
him
and
hurry
to
revenge
himself
and
get
his
property
back
in
brief
the
only
way
in
which
superiority
can
be
maintained
is
in
letting
others
see
that
we
have
no
need
of
them
at
all
moreover
schopenhauer
notes
it
is
a
good
plan
to
appear
a
trifle
disdainful
from
time
to
time
such
an
attitude
has
a
strengthening
effect
on
friendship
chi
non
istima
vien
stimato
he
who
shows
no
respect
is
respected
himself
runs
the
sagacious
italian
proverb
but
above
all
if
any
one
does
possess
a
high
value
in
our
eyes
it
should
be
hidden
from
him
as
a
sin
this
advice
is
not
particularly
exhilarating
but
it
is
sound
too
much
kindness
disagrees
with
dogs
to
say
nothing
of
men
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
more
intellectual
a
man
is
the
more
easily
he
is
deceived
there
seems
to
be
something
almost
incompatible
between
a
high
degree
of
culture
and
an
extended
knowledge
of
men
and
things
whereas
in
the
case
of
people
of
ordinary
calibre
a
lack
of
experience
will
not
necessarily
hinder
them
from
properly
conducting
their
affairs
they
possess
as
it
were
an
knowledge
which
is
furnished
to
them
by
their
own
nature
and
it
is
precisely
the
absence
of
this
knowledge
that
causes
the
mistakes
of
the
more
refined
even
when
a
man
has
learned
from
the
teaching
of
others
and
through
his
own
experience
just
what
he
may
expect
from
men
in
general
even
when
he
is
thoroughly
convinced
that
five
sixths
of
them
are
so
constituted
that
it
is
better
for
him
to
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
them
even
then
his
knowledge
is
insufficient
to
preserve
him
from
many
false
calculations
a
presumable
wiseacre
for
instance
may
accidentally
be
drawn
into
the
society
of
people
with
whom
he
is
unacquainted
and
be
astonished
to
find
that
in
conversation
and
manners
they
are
sensible
loyal
and
sincere
and
perhaps
intelligent
and
witty
in
that
case
schopenhauer
warns
him
to
keep
well
on
his
guard
for
the
reason
that
nature
is
entirely
unlike
the
dramaturge
who
when
he
wishes
to
create
a
scoundrel
or
a
simpleton
sets
about
it
so
awkwardly
that
he
seems
to
be
standing
behind
each
character
in
turn
and
in
disavowing
their
gestures
and
words
to
be
warning
the
audience
that
one
is
a
ruffian
and
the
other
a
fool
and
that
no
one
is
to
believe
a
word
that
they
say
it
is
not
at
all
in
this
way
that
nature
acts
her
method
is
that
of
shakespeare
and
goethe
in
whose
plays
each
person
be
he
the
devil
himself
speaks
as
he
ought
to
and
is
conceived
so
realistically
that
he
attracts
and
commands
attention
to
think
then
that
the
devil
goes
about
with
horns
and
the
fool
with
bells
is
to
lay
one
self
open
to
a
continual
deception
for
as
a
rule
our
moralist
says
men
behave
very
much
like
the
moon
or
like
the
hunchback
they
show
only
one
side
and
even
then
they
have
a
peculiar
talent
for
making
up
their
faces
into
a
species
of
mask
which
exactly
represents
they
ought
to
and
this
they
assume
whenever
they
wish
to
be
well
received
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
say
some
schopenhauer
advice
is
put
not
your
trust
in
masks
and
to
substantiate
his
warning
he
quotes
an
old
proverb
which
holds
that
no
matter
how
vicious
a
dog
may
be
he
can
still
wag
his
tail
to
all
these
rules
and
suggestions
there
are
of
course
exceptions
there
are
even
exceptions
that
are
incommensurably
great
for
the
difference
between
individuals
is
gigantic
but
taken
as
a
whole
schopenhauer
condemns
the
world
as
irreclaimably
bad
and
it
may
be
added
that
one
does
not
need
to
be
a
professional
pessimist
to
arrive
at
very
nearly
the
same
conclusion
but
beyond
these
broad
recommendations
a
few
others
are
given
on
our
proper
bearing
and
attitude
to
the
world
at
large
and
which
summed
up
in
his
own
words
amount
in
brief
to
the
teaching
that
one
half
of
all
wisdom
consists
in
neither
loving
nor
hating
and
the
other
half
in
saying
nothing
and
believing
nothing
lamennais
exclaimed
one
day
my
soul
was
born
with
a
sore
and
to
some
it
may
perhaps
seem
that
on
schopenhauer
heart
an
ulcer
had
battened
during
each
of
the
seventy
years
that
formed
his
life
certainly
he
has
appeared
to
force
the
note
many
times
but
it
is
permissible
to
doubt
that
he
prepared
a
single
paragraph
in
which
he
expressed
himself
otherwise
than
as
he
really
thought
in
his
pessimism
there
is
no
pose
and
as
little
affectation
he
wrote
only
what
he
felt
to
be
true
and
he
did
so
with
a
cheerful
indifference
to
approval
or
dislike
his
position
was
simply
that
of
a
notary
drawing
up
provisos
and
conditions
in
strict
accord
with
the
statutes
of
life
of
which
he
stood
as
witness
his
mother
who
had
little
cause
to
come
forward
as
an
eulogist
paid
him
years
after
their
separation
this
one
sincere
tribute
with
all
his
vagaries
she
said
i
have
never
known
my
son
to
tell
a
lie
other
encomiums
have
of
course
been
passed
upon
him
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
one
more
glorious
than
this
over
and
above
his
disregard
of
sham
and
falsehood
beyond
his
theory
of
force
and
the
seductions
of
his
ethics
schopenhauer
is
chiefly
remarkable
in
this
that
he
was
the
first
to
detect
and
logically
explain
that
universal
nausea
which
circulating
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
presents
those
symptoms
of
melancholy
and
disillusion
which
patent
to
every
observer
are
indubitably
born
of
the
insufficiencies
of
modern
civilization
where
then
it
may
be
asked
for
this
malady
of
the
refined
are
the
borderlands
of
happiness
to
be
found
from
the
standpoint
of
this
teacher
the
answer
is
that
they
are
discoverable
simply
and
solely
in
an
unobtrusive
culture
of
self
in
a
withdrawal
from
every
aggressive
influence
and
above
all
in
a
supreme
indifference
which
culpable
though
alluring
permits
the
neophyte
to
declaim
with
baudelaire
mon
cœur
dors
ton
sommeil
de
brute
the
foregoing
attempt
to
winnow
some
of
the
finer
fibres
of
thought
from
the
six
volumes
which
form
the
complete
edition
of
works
leaves
admittedly
much
to
be
desired
there
has
been
as
the
phrase
goes
an
des
and
in
consequence
much
attendant
indecision
as
to
the
choice
to
be
made
of
different
yet
equally
interesting
topics
the
passages
that
have
been
selected
and
annotated
in
this
and
in
the
preceding
chapter
have
been
it
may
be
explained
so
selected
because
they
seemed
when
arranged
with
some
attempt
at
orderly
sequence
to
present
in
the
fewest
possible
words
the
essence
of
the
main
idea
which
runs
through
the
entire
philosophy
and
which
in
the
absence
of
some
such
arrangement
demands
a
concentration
more
prolonged
than
is
usually
at
the
disposal
of
the
ordinary
reader
those
who
are
already
acquainted
with
works
and
who
may
do
the
present
writer
the
honor
of
reading
this
exposition
will
perhaps
object
to
it
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
enter
sufficiently
into
the
scientific
side
of
the
doctrine
and
through
this
neglect
leaves
the
reader
in
the
dark
as
to
its
true
value
to
this
presumable
objection
the
writer
begs
leave
to
make
answer
that
the
scientific
aspect
of
the
doctrine
has
been
so
exhaustively
treated
by
others
that
it
has
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
time
to
enter
into
any
further
consideration
of
a
subject
whose
true
value
in
spite
of
the
numberless
controversies
and
arguments
which
it
continues
to
create
still
remains
undetermined
moreover
as
will
have
been
readily
seen
the
foregoing
pages
have
in
no
sense
been
addressed
to
the
scientist
and
that
for
the
reason
that
exact
information
is
only
obtainable
from
the
philosophy
itself
or
from
such
a
complete
and
therefore
voluminous
analysis
as
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
treatise
of
this
description
the
aim
of
these
chapters
is
but
to
draw
in
outline
the
principal
features
of
this
doctrine
and
in
so
doing
to
present
in
the
absence
of
complete
translations
a
little
of
that
vigor
and
color
which
has
raised
the
original
to
the
prominent
position
it
holds
among
the
foremost
works
of
modern
thought
no
attempt
at
the
polemical
has
been
made
and
this
for
the
reason
that
it
is
seldom
advisable
to
attack
the
truth
the
notations
and
criticisms
which
have
been
offered
have
been
prepared
not
with
the
wish
to
controvert
but
rather
with
the
hope
that
they
might
serve
to
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
whole
philosophy
chapter
the
great
quietus
it
is
related
of
schopenhauer
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
putting
down
a
gold
piece
on
the
where
he
dined
and
of
taking
it
up
again
when
the
dinner
was
ended
this
gold
piece
he
explained
to
his
boswell
was
for
the
waiter
the
first
time
that
any
one
of
the
different
officers
who
frequented
the
was
heard
discussing
a
loftier
topic
than
that
which
is
circled
in
wine
woman
and
song
as
the
story
runs
no
occasion
ever
presented
itself
in
which
he
could
in
this
manner
express
his
pleasure
and
contentment
but
had
he
lived
long
enough
to
meet
lieutenant
von
hartmann
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
gold
piece
would
have
formed
an
immediate
and
rightful
part
of
the
waiter
perquisites
this
gentleman
who
is
now
no
longer
an
officer
but
simply
a
thinker
and
a
man
of
letters
may
in
many
respects
be
regarded
as
schopenhauer
direct
descendant
to
the
world
at
large
very
little
concerning
him
is
known
and
that
little
is
contained
in
a
modest
autobiography
which
appeared
a
few
years
ago
and
to
which
his
publisher
has
since
added
a
supplement
the
meagre
details
that
are
furnished
therein
amount
in
brief
to
this
eduard
von
hartmann
was
born
in
in
berlin
in
which
city
he
passed
an
uneventful
boyhood
the
school
which
he
attended
and
which
like
most
other
schools
forced
the
pupils
to
master
a
quantity
of
subjects
whose
usefulness
may
be
questioned
brought
him
into
an
almost
open
revolt
against
a
system
of
education
which
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
waste
of
time
on
leaving
the
gymnasium
he
decided
for
reasons
which
to
the
average
german
must
seem
fantastic
to
enter
the
military
service
at
once
instead
of
passing
the
usual
semesters
at
a
university
to
this
budding
pessimist
student
life
seemed
to
offer
but
dull
variations
between
commonplaceness
and
vulgarity
to
listen
or
not
to
listen
to
sundry
poorly
expressed
lectures
by
day
to
engulf
at
night
a
certain
quantity
of
beer
in
stone
measures
and
to
diversify
these
occupations
in
receiving
slashes
on
the
or
in
affording
amusement
to
the
hebes
of
prussian
restaurants
was
not
to
him
the
life
that
was
called
ideal
very
wisely
then
and
in
accordance
with
the
example
which
his
father
had
already
given
he
chose
in
a
military
career
a
profession
most
apt
to
satisfy
those
inclinations
of
the
scientist
and
of
the
artist
which
had
already
begun
to
exert
an
influence
upon
him
in
the
year
herr
von
hartmann
entered
the
crack
artillery
regiment
of
berlin
as
volunteer
he
then
passed
three
years
at
the
artillery
school
intermingling
the
scientific
studies
of
his
profession
with
artistic
and
philosophic
researches
and
frequenting
meanwhile
the
refined
society
to
which
his
family
belonged
about
this
time
a
rheumatic
affection
which
had
first
declared
itself
toward
the
close
of
his
became
complicated
with
a
fracture
of
some
of
the
delicate
machinery
of
the
knee
the
injury
was
both
painful
and
incurable
and
in
he
was
obliged
to
resign
his
position
and
thereupon
left
the
army
with
the
grade
of
first
lieutenant
these
latter
details
are
given
by
way
of
counterbalance
to
the
calumnies
of
his
enemies
who
in
explaining
his
pessimism
by
the
state
of
his
health
which
they
insinuate
was
brought
about
by
excessive
and
unusual
debauchery
have
in
one
way
and
another
managed
to
vituperate
his
chief
work
into
nine
editions
on
leaving
the
army
he
sought
a
career
first
as
painter
and
then
as
musician
it
did
not
take
him
long
however
to
discover
that
his
vocation
was
not
such
as
is
found
in
purely
artistic
pursuits
the
bankruptcy
of
all
my
ambitions
he
says
was
complete
there
remained
to
me
but
one
thing
and
that
was
thought
it
was
from
thought
then
that
he
demanded
a
consolation
and
an
employment
and
turning
to
metaphysics
he
began
at
once
to
plan
his
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
meanwhile
for
his
own
distraction
and
instruction
he
had
written
a
few
essays
of
which
but
one
was
destined
to
see
the
light
of
day
this
monograph
die
dialektische
methode
was
so
favorably
viewed
at
rostock
that
he
received
therefrom
the
degree
and
title
of
doctor
of
philosophy
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
when
completed
remained
a
year
in
his
closet
and
was
only
published
in
owing
to
an
accidental
meeting
with
an
intelligent
publisher
before
as
since
the
appearance
and
success
of
this
work
which
is
very
generally
considered
as
the
chief
philosophical
event
of
the
last
two
decades
von
hartmann
has
lived
at
berlin
where
he
endeavors
in
life
to
prove
the
practical
value
of
evolutionary
pessimism
which
it
is
his
wish
to
substitute
for
the
indifferentism
and
quietist
doctrines
of
schopenhauer
personally
von
hartmann
is
a
very
attractive
individual
and
his
attractiveness
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
commonplace
and
at
the
same
time
nothing
affected
about
him
when
i
called
at
his
house
i
found
him
coiled
up
in
a
rug
on
one
of
those
long
chairs
that
are
familiar
to
every
ocean
traveler
my
first
impression
was
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
giant
and
as
the
berlinese
as
a
race
are
notoriously
tall
i
was
only
surprised
at
the
great
size
of
his
head
which
differed
singularly
from
that
of
the
ordinary
prussian
his
hair
was
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
in
the
manner
popularly
termed
la
but
which
is
more
noticeable
in
vienna
than
in
petersburg
his
eyes
which
were
large
and
luminous
possessed
an
expression
of
such
indulgence
as
would
put
the
most
timid
visitor
at
ease
owing
partly
to
the
arrangement
of
his
hair
his
forehead
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
expansive
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
hidden
in
a
beard
which
descended
very
nearly
to
his
waist
while
as
for
his
moustache
it
is
i
think
the
longest
in
metaphysics
in
some
way
or
another
i
had
gotten
to
believe
that
it
was
part
of
the
professional
philosopher
to
be
both
and
i
always
pictured
him
as
a
class
as
wearing
spectacles
far
down
on
the
nose
as
being
somewhat
snuffy
and
carelessly
tired
in
loose
and
shabby
i
can
give
no
reason
for
this
fancy
of
mine
other
than
that
it
is
one
of
those
pictures
which
we
all
draw
of
people
and
places
that
we
have
not
seen
if
i
remember
rightly
sala
said
that
he
imagined
leipzig
to
be
a
city
of
very
squat
houses
in
which
dwelt
little
girls
in
blue
skirts
and
this
until
he
got
there
and
found
that
it
was
precisely
like
any
other
of
its
kind
as
a
child
and
indeed
until
very
lately
i
invariably
thought
of
hungary
as
having
red
roads
bordered
by
crimson
houses
and
bluffs
of
green
while
all
about
i
saw
in
fancy
splendid
horses
prancing
in
rich
caparisons
but
as
any
traveler
will
admit
hungary
in
point
of
natural
effects
is
as
humdrum
as
connecticut
for
real
color
i
suppose
one
must
go
to
japan
and
yet
there
are
many
who
have
done
so
and
then
returned
utterly
disillusioned
von
hartmann
took
away
my
illusion
about
the
philosopher
he
had
a
rug
it
is
true
but
no
or
at
least
not
one
which
was
visible
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
careless
mien
and
abstracted
attitudes
which
i
had
expected
to
use
a
current
phrase
he
was
very
wide
awake
and
i
may
add
that
to
one
who
has
lived
among
germans
he
seemed
refreshingly
hospitable
and
graciously
courteous
even
in
its
most
pleasant
season
berlin
is
not
a
pleasant
city
a
lounge
of
but
half
an
hour
on
the
unter
den
linden
results
through
unconscious
imitation
in
an
enforced
quickstep
to
begin
with
there
are
too
many
big
houses
and
then
there
are
too
many
big
soldiers
and
while
the
soldiers
present
to
the
stranger
an
appearance
of
arrogant
hostility
the
houses
not
to
be
outdone
try
to
look
as
much
like
the
soldiers
as
possible
and
loom
up
in
alert
unbending
aggressiveness
indeed
i
have
now
in
my
mind
a
certain
street
which
when
i
looked
down
it
almost
got
up
and
threatened
me
i
experienced
therefore
a
subtle
pleasure
on
discovering
that
out
of
the
whole
of
rigid
berlin
von
hartmann
had
chosen
his
residence
in
the
most
unsoldierly
and
for
that
reason
the
most
attractive
part
and
it
was
to
this
quarter
of
the
city
that
i
went
to
visit
the
man
who
in
spite
of
certain
vagaries
of
thought
may
be
considered
as
germany
first
thinker
when
he
had
disentangled
himself
from
the
folds
of
his
rug
the
impression
which
had
been
produced
by
the
size
of
his
head
and
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
vanished
entirely
i
thought
for
the
moment
of
the
quaint
myths
of
the
earlier
teutons
of
the
gnomes
and
kobolds
for
von
hartmann
while
massive
in
head
and
shoulders
is
yet
short
and
undersized
and
the
suggestion
of
the
rhine
legends
which
his
appearance
caused
was
heightened
by
the
strange
effect
produced
by
the
luxuriance
of
his
beard
and
moustache
he
had
barely
spoken
however
before
i
recognized
in
him
not
only
the
man
of
the
world
which
goes
without
the
telling
but
the
gentleman
and
in
a
moment
the
thinker
stendhal
says
somewhere
in
speaking
of
german
that
it
took
him
two
whole
years
to
forget
the
beastly
language
stendhal
was
what
is
termed
nowadays
an
impressionist
and
his
expression
may
perhaps
on
that
account
be
excused
in
any
event
german
is
decidedly
an
unpleasant
tongue
it
is
very
rich
rich
even
to
exuberance
and
when
it
is
well
handled
it
is
to
the
initiate
delightful
in
many
respects
but
to
the
latin
and
the
average
it
is
terribly
tortuous
and
most
easy
to
lose
one
way
in
i
had
hoped
therefore
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
talk
with
von
hartmann
in
some
more
flowing
form
of
speech
but
as
he
preferred
german
it
was
not
of
course
my
place
to
rebel
and
i
soon
found
that
i
had
nothing
to
regret
i
have
had
in
the
fatherland
the
privilege
of
hearing
some
very
accomplished
actors
and
i
have
also
sat
beneath
some
very
eloquent
speakers
but
the
amplitude
and
resources
of
the
german
language
were
first
made
clear
to
me
by
this
gentleman
when
he
spoke
i
may
say
without
exaggeration
that
his
words
seemed
less
like
figures
of
speech
than
evocations
of
pictures
i
had
puzzled
for
some
time
over
a
particular
point
in
his
teaching
and
when
i
told
him
of
my
difficulty
he
drew
down
before
me
a
series
of
illustrations
and
examples
which
were
as
well
defined
as
though
they
formed
a
panorama
on
the
wall
and
therewithal
was
such
a
fluency
of
verb
such
a
precision
of
adjective
and
such
a
nicety
of
accent
that
for
the
first
and
only
time
i
loved
the
german
language
von
hartmann
is
in
no
sense
a
misanthrope
he
leads
a
quiet
and
easy
life
demonstrating
by
his
own
example
that
pessimism
is
not
a
gospel
of
desolation
personally
he
has
had
many
grave
misfortunes
he
has
suffered
in
health
in
name
and
in
purse
he
has
lost
many
who
were
most
dear
to
him
but
his
laugh
is
as
prompt
and
as
frank
as
a
boy
at
the
head
of
his
table
sits
a
gracious
and
charming
woman
his
children
are
rich
in
strength
and
spirits
and
an
observer
lately
said
of
him
and
his
family
if
you
wish
to
see
happy
and
contented
faces
go
call
on
the
hartmanns
beyond
writing
a
dozen
or
more
monographs
and
dissertations
on
philosophical
subjects
von
hartmann
has
also
charmed
the
public
with
two
elaborate
and
poems
his
chief
claim
to
recognition
however
and
the
one
which
has
placed
him
at
the
head
of
contemporary
metaphysics
is
the
work
already
mentioned
in
which
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
his
predecessor
and
yet
with
a
diffuseness
of
argument
which
had
no
part
in
schopenhauer
system
he
reduces
the
motor
forces
of
the
universe
to
a
dual
principle
which
he
terms
the
or
the
unconscious
it
is
unnecessary
to
enter
into
any
minute
examination
of
this
theory
of
his
in
which
with
a
juggle
of
fancies
and
facts
he
tries
to
reconcile
the
teaching
of
hegel
with
that
of
schopenhauer
for
however
it
may
be
considered
it
is
in
any
event
but
loosely
connected
with
that
part
of
his
philosophy
which
treats
of
the
matter
in
hand
it
will
be
sufficient
for
the
understanding
of
what
is
to
follow
to
note
simply
that
after
examining
the
forms
of
phenomenal
existence
matter
life
organic
and
inorganic
humanity
and
so
on
he
presents
the
unconscious
as
the
the
universal
soul
from
which
through
determined
laws
the
multiplicity
of
individuals
and
characters
is
derived
this
is
sovereignly
wise
and
the
world
is
admirable
in
every
respect
but
while
he
argues
in
this
way
that
the
world
is
the
best
one
possible
he
has
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
life
itself
is
irreclaimably
miserable
the
originality
of
his
system
consists
in
a
theory
of
optimistic
evolution
as
counterbalanced
by
a
pessimistic
analysis
of
life
and
also
in
the
manner
in
which
with
a
glut
of
curious
argument
he
concludes
that
as
the
world
does
not
tend
to
either
universal
or
even
individual
happiness
the
great
aim
of
science
should
be
to
emancipate
man
from
the
love
of
life
and
in
this
wise
lead
the
world
back
to
chaos
the
main
idea
runs
somewhat
as
follows
the
interest
of
the
unconscious
is
opposed
to
our
own
it
would
be
to
our
advantage
not
to
live
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
unconscious
that
we
should
do
so
and
that
others
should
be
brought
into
existence
through
us
the
unconscious
therefore
in
the
furtherment
of
its
aims
has
surrounded
man
with
such
illusions
as
are
capable
of
deluding
him
into
the
belief
that
life
is
a
pleasant
thing
well
worth
the
living
the
instincts
that
are
within
us
are
but
the
different
forms
beneath
which
this
unreasoning
desire
to
live
is
at
work
and
with
which
the
unconscious
inspires
man
and
moulds
him
to
its
profit
hence
the
energy
so
foolishly
expended
for
the
protection
of
an
existence
which
is
but
the
right
to
suffer
hence
the
erroneous
idea
which
is
formed
of
the
pain
and
pleasure
derivable
from
life
and
hence
the
modification
of
past
disenchantments
through
the
influence
of
fresh
and
newer
hopes
with
regard
to
happiness
there
are
according
to
hartmann
three
periods
or
forms
of
illusion
from
all
of
which
the
world
must
be
thoroughly
freed
before
the
great
aim
of
science
can
be
attained
the
first
of
these
illusions
consists
in
the
idea
that
under
certain
circumstances
happiness
is
now
obtainable
on
earth
the
second
in
the
belief
that
happiness
is
realizable
in
a
future
state
and
the
third
in
the
opinion
that
happiness
will
be
discovered
in
the
march
of
progress
through
the
coming
centuries
of
these
three
ideas
the
first
has
for
some
time
past
been
recognized
by
many
as
a
chimera
in
certain
quarters
the
decomposition
of
the
second
has
already
begun
but
the
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
third
is
unquestionably
the
paramount
conviction
of
the
present
century
when
each
of
these
three
illusions
has
been
utterly
routed
and
universally
done
away
with
then
hartmann
considers
the
world
will
be
ripe
for
its
great
quietus
the
first
of
these
three
forms
is
of
course
the
most
tenacious
indeed
it
is
an
incontestible
fact
that
man
even
when
miserable
clings
to
life
and
loves
it
not
only
when
there
is
some
vague
hope
of
a
brighter
future
but
even
under
its
most
distressing
conditions
it
is
therefore
against
this
illusion
that
pessimism
to
be
successful
must
rain
the
hardest
blows
the
views
of
many
eminent
writers
on
this
subject
have
already
been
expressed
in
the
course
of
these
pages
but
their
views
while
in
a
measure
important
should
nevertheless
be
received
with
a
certain
amount
of
caution
for
they
emanate
from
superior
minds
in
which
melancholy
as
the
attribute
of
genius
constantly
presides
let
us
imagine
then
with
hartmann
a
man
who
is
not
a
genius
but
simply
a
man
of
ordinary
culture
enjoying
the
advantages
of
an
enviable
position
a
man
who
is
neither
wearied
by
pleasure
nor
oppressed
by
exceptional
misfortunes
in
brief
a
man
capable
of
comparing
the
advantages
which
he
enjoys
with
the
disadvantages
of
inferior
members
of
society
let
us
suppose
that
death
comes
to
this
man
and
speaks
somewhat
as
follows
your
hour
is
at
hand
it
remains
with
you
however
to
live
at
once
a
new
life
with
the
past
entirely
effaced
or
to
accept
the
grave
as
it
is
there
can
be
little
doubt
if
this
hypothetical
individual
has
not
lived
carelessly
and
thoughtlessly
and
does
not
permit
his
judgment
to
be
biased
by
the
desire
for
life
at
any
price
that
he
would
choose
death
in
preference
to
another
existence
in
which
he
would
be
assured
of
none
of
the
favorable
conditions
which
he
had
hitherto
enjoyed
he
will
recommence
his
own
life
perhaps
but
no
other
of
an
inferior
grade
this
choice
however
would
be
that
of
an
intelligent
man
and
might
be
objected
to
on
a
ground
not
dissimilar
to
the
one
already
advanced
against
the
judgments
of
genius
but
let
us
follow
hartmann
still
further
and
in
descending
the
spiral
of
humanity
put
the
same
question
to
every
one
we
meet
let
us
take
for
instance
a
woodcutter
a
hottentot
or
an
and
ask
of
each
which
he
prefers
death
or
a
new
existence
in
the
body
of
a
hippopotamus
or
a
flea
each
will
answer
death
but
none
of
them
will
hesitate
between
their
own
lives
and
death
and
if
a
like
question
be
put
to
the
hippopotamus
and
the
flea
their
answers
will
be
precisely
similar
the
difference
in
the
comparative
judgment
that
each
would
bring
to
bear
on
his
own
life
and
on
that
of
life
in
an
inferior
degree
results
evidently
from
the
fact
that
on
being
questioned
each
enters
imaginatively
into
the
existence
of
the
lower
creation
and
at
once
judges
its
condition
to
be
insupportable
the
difference
between
the
opinion
which
the
flea
holds
on
the
value
of
its
own
existence
and
our
own
private
judgment
on
this
insect
is
derived
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
flea
has
a
quantity
of
absurd
illusions
which
we
do
not
share
and
these
illusions
cause
it
such
an
excess
of
imaginary
happiness
that
in
consequence
it
prefers
its
own
life
to
death
in
this
the
flea
is
not
wrong
on
the
contrary
it
is
quite
right
for
the
value
of
an
existence
can
only
be
measured
in
accordance
with
its
natural
limitations
in
this
sense
illusion
is
as
serviceable
as
truth
from
this
introduction
it
follows
quite
of
itself
that
each
and
every
creature
is
capable
of
weighing
the
discomforts
of
an
existence
inferior
to
that
in
which
it
dwells
and
yet
is
unable
to
rightly
judge
its
own
each
can
discern
the
illusions
with
which
its
inferior
is
surrounded
but
is
always
defenseless
against
its
own
save
under
exceptional
circumstances
as
in
the
case
of
genius
hartmann
concludes
therefore
very
logically
that
an
intelligence
which
is
capable
of
embracing
every
form
of
life
would
condemn
existence
in
its
totality
in
the
same
manner
that
an
intelligence
relatively
restricted
condemns
it
in
part
in
drawing
up
the
of
life
hartmann
differs
from
schopenhauer
on
the
question
of
the
purely
negative
character
of
pleasure
that
pleasure
is
at
times
a
negative
condition
as
in
the
cessation
of
pain
he
willingly
admits
but
from
his
standpoint
it
is
something
else
besides
it
may
be
either
positive
although
derived
from
an
illusion
as
in
love
or
real
as
in
art
and
science
nevertheless
the
predominance
of
pain
over
pleasure
seems
to
be
firmly
established
and
his
examination
of
this
subject
is
not
without
a
repellant
interest
the
four
greatest
blessings
of
life
are
admittedly
health
youth
liberty
and
but
from
their
nature
hartmann
points
out
these
things
are
incapable
of
raising
man
out
of
indifference
into
pleasure
save
only
as
they
may
help
to
diminish
an
anterior
pain
or
guard
him
from
a
possible
discomfort
take
the
case
of
health
for
instance
no
man
thinks
of
his
nerves
until
they
are
affected
nor
yet
of
his
eyes
until
they
ache
indeed
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
a
man
who
is
in
perfect
condition
only
knows
that
he
has
a
body
because
he
sees
and
touches
it
liberty
may
be
regarded
in
much
the
same
manner
it
is
unnoticed
until
it
is
in
some
way
interfered
with
while
youth
which
is
the
most
propitious
condition
of
life
is
in
itself
but
capability
and
possibility
and
not
possession
nor
yet
delight
the
certainty
of
shelter
from
need
and
privation
hartmann
very
rightly
considers
merely
as
the
qua
of
life
in
its
baldest
aspect
for
he
argues
were
it
otherwise
the
simple
fact
of
living
would
satisfy
and
content
us
but
we
all
know
that
an
assured
existence
is
a
torment
if
nothing
fills
the
gap
in
the
menagerie
of
beasts
that
torture
life
there
is
one
baudelaire
says
in
his
easy
metre
that
is
more
hideous
than
all
the
rest
it
is
chargé
pleur
involontaire
il
rêve
en
fumant

lecteur
ce
monstre

hypocrite

this
insupportable
companion
of
inaction
is
usually
banished
by
work
but
then
to
him
who
is
obliged
to
labor
is
not
work
often
distasteful
and
even
a
species
of
misfortune
indeed
there
are
few
if
any
who
ever
work
save
under
compulsion
and
whether
the
compulsion
is
caused
by
the
attracting
force
of
fame
the
desire
to
escape
from
want
or
comes
simply
as
a
promise
of
relief
from
boredom
the
incentive
and
necessity
are
one
and
the
same
it
is
true
that
man
when
at
work
is
consoled
by
the
thought
of
rest
but
then
work
and
rest
merely
serve
to
change
his
position
and
they
do
so
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
that
uneasiness
which
forces
the
invalid
to
turn
in
bed
and
then
to
turn
back
again
when
it
has
shown
him
that
the
second
position
is
no
better
than
the
first
the
great
blessings
of
life
therefore
reduce
themselves
in
brief
to
this
they
represent
but
that
affranchisement
from
pain
which
is
equivalent
to
a
state
of
pure
indifference
but
as
no
one
reaches
this
condition
save
momentarily
and
by
accident
it
seems
to
follow
that
life
has
less
charm
than
which
represents
indifference
in
its
most
absolute
and
unquestioned
form
this
state
of
beatitude
is
yet
to
be
acquired
meanwhile
as
schiller
says
so
long
as
philosophy
does
not
govern
the
world
hunger
and
love
will
suffice
to
keep
it
in
motion
after
the
four
causes
of
contentment
hartmann
views
on
the
two
incentives
to
activity
remain
to
be
examined
in
regard
to
the
first
it
may
be
said
without
extravagance
that
the
sufferings
of
hunger
rule
the
greater
portion
of
the
millions
of
the
earth
inhabitants
europe
not
long
since
averaged
a
famine
every
seven
years
now
the
facilities
of
communication
have
replaced
famine
with
an
increased
valuation
of
food
death
is
the
rarest
and
the
least
important
evil
that
hunger
occasions
what
is
most
to
be
regarded
is
the
physical
and
intellectual
impoverishment
the
mortality
among
children
and
the
particular
maladies
which
it
engenders
according
to
hartmann
the
analysis
of
hunger
shows
that
in
satisfying
its
demands
the
individual
does
not
raise
his
sensibility
above
a
state
of
pure
indifference
he
may
it
is
true
under
favorable
circumstances
cause
a
certain
pleasure
to
predominate
over
suffering
by
means
of
taste
and
digestion
but
in
the
animal
kingdom
as
in
humanity
taken
as
a
whole
the
tortures
caused
by
hunger
are
greatly
in
excess
of
any
pleasures
that
may
attach
to
it
in
fact
from
hartmann
standpoint
the
necessity
of
eating
is
in
itself
a
misfortune
after
all
that
has
been
said
through
centuries
of
literature
on
the
subject
of
love
it
is
certainly
difficult
to
be
original
but
hartmann
has
at
least
the
merit
of
presenting
it
in
a
more
abstract
light
and
from
a
less
alluring
standpoint
than
any
other
writer
who
has
handled
the
subject
for
love
according
to
his
views
is
either
contrary
to
the
laws
of
society
and
as
such
environed
by
perils
and
pains
vice
and
degradation
or
it
is
perfectly
legal
and
in
that
case
quickly
extinguished
in
the
majority
of
cases
he
says
insurmountable
obstacles
arise
between
the
two
lovers
and
cause
a
consequent
and
immense
despair
while
in
the
rarer
and
more
fortunate
instances
the
expected
happiness
turns
out
to
be
purely
illusory
it
is
however
as
hard
to
love
as
it
is
not
to
love
but
he
hartmann
says
who
once
recognizes
that
the
happiness
which
it
offers
is
but
a
chimera
and
that
its
pains
are
greater
than
its
pleasures
will
while
unable
perhaps
to
escape
entirely
from
its
allurements
be
none
the
less
able
to
judge
it
differently
from
the
novice
and
therefore
capable
of
diminishing
some
of
its
suffering
and
some
of
the
disproportion
between
its
joys
and
its
sorrows
according
to
this
savage
moralist
then
love
is
either
an
illusory
and
quickly
vanishing
happiness
or
an
actual
suffering
and
resembles
hunger
precisely
in
that
it
is
in
itself
and
to
the
individual
a
veritable
curse
hartmann
judges
marriage
with
an
epigram
borrowed
from
lessing
there
is
at
most
but
one
disagreeable
woman
in
the
world
it
is
only
a
pity
that
every
man
gets
her
for
himself
in
very
much
the
same
manner
are
the
ties
of
family
and
friendship
weighed
and
judged
scattered
here
and
there
is
some
reflection
of
schopenhauer
wit
and
wisdom
but
generally
the
discussion
is
defective
and
lacks
the
grace
of
style
and
purity
of
diction
which
characterized
the
latter
writer
the
sentiments
of
honor
public
esteem
ambition
and
glory
depend
he
says
on
the
opinion
of
others
and
are
therefore
merely
toys
of
the
imagination
for
my
joys
and
troubles
exist
in
my
mind
and
not
in
the
minds
of
other
people
their
opinion
concerning
me
has
merely
a
conventional
value
and
not
one
which
is
effective
for
me
but
to
him
who
journeys
through
the
desert
called
life
there
is
still
one
suave
and
green
oasis
hartmann
is
not
utterly
relentless
and
though
perhaps
on
all
other
subjects
he
may
seem
skeptical
as
a
ragpicker
he
has
yet
a
word
or
two
of
cheer
for
art
and
science
these
pleasant
lands
however
are
only
traversable
by
rare
and
privileged
natures
for
if
from
the
pleasure
which
attaches
to
music
painting
poetry
philosophy
and
science
a
deduction
be
made
of
all
that
which
is
but
sham
dilettanteism
and
vanity
the
more
considerable
part
of
this
supreme
resource
will
be
found
to
have
disappeared
that
which
remains
over
is
the
compensation
which
nature
preserves
as
recompense
to
the
extreme
sensibility
of
the
artist
and
thinker
to
whom
the
miseries
of
life
are
far
more
poignant
than
to
other
men
whose
sensibilities
are
duller
and
less
impressionable
now
if
the
ubiquity
of
suffering
is
admitted
the
temperament
of
this
latter
class
is
in
the
long
run
undoubtedly
preferable
to
the
more
refined
organization
of
the
artist
for
after
all
a
state
of
comparative
insensibility
is
evidently
not
too
dearly
bought
when
the
price
is
merely
the
lack
of
a
delight
whose
absence
is
not
a
privation
and
which
to
those
able
to
appreciate
it
is
as
rare
as
it
is
limited
in
duration
moreover
even
the
real
and
ineffaceable
pleasures
which
the
thinker
and
artist
enjoy
are
obtainable
only
after
much
trouble
and
discomfort
genius
does
not
fall
from
the
skies
and
complete
in
armor
and
equipment
the
study
which
is
to
develop
it
is
a
task
painful
and
tiresome
whose
pleasures
are
rare
and
generally
speaking
but
those
of
anticipation
and
vanquished
obstacles
each
art
has
its
mechanical
side
which
demands
a
long
apprenticeship
and
even
then
after
the
preliminary
preparation
the
only
pleasant
moments
are
those
of
conception
which
in
turn
are
directly
succeeded
by
the
long
hours
of
technical
execution
in
the
case
of
the
amateur
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
good
music
of
seeing
a
fine
actor
or
of
looking
at
works
of
art
is
undoubtedly
the
one
that
causes
the
least
amount
of
inconvenience
and
yet
hartmann
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
noting
that
even
this
pleasure
is
seldom
unalloyed
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
bother
of
going
to
the
then
there
is
the
bad
air
and
hubbub
in
the
theatre
after
this
come
the
dangers
of
catching
cold
of
being
run
into
or
annoyed
in
a
dozen
different
ways
and
especially
the
fatigue
of
watching
and
listening
in
the
case
of
the
artist
there
are
the
inevitable
deceptions
the
struggles
with
envy
the
indifference
and
disdain
of
the
public
chamfort
was
wont
to
exclaim
the
public
indeed
how
many
idiots
does
it
take
to
make
a
public
the
public
nevertheless
has
the
ability
to
make
itself
very
disagreeable
and
not
every
one
courts
its
smile
with
success
if
in
addition
to
all
these
things
the
nervous
organization
of
the
thinker
more
vibrant
a
thousandfold
than
that
of
other
men
is
taken
into
consideration
it
will
be
seen
that
hartmann
is
not
wrong
in
stating
that
the
pleasures
to
which
this
class
is
privileged
are
expiated
by
a
greater
sensibility
to
pain
but
while
art
is
not
without
its
disadvantages
hartmann
declares
that
life
still
holds
one
solace
that
is
supreme
and
unalloyed
unconscious
sleep
he
says
is
relatively
the
happiest
condition
for
it
is
the
only
one
from
which
pain
is
completely
banished
with
dreams
however
all
the
miseries
of
life
return
and
happiness
when
it
then
appears
does
so
only
in
the
vague
form
of
an
agreeable
sensation
such
as
that
of
being
freed
from
the
body
or
flying
through
the
air
the
pleasures
of
art
and
science
the
only
ones
which
could
reconcile
a
sensible
man
to
life
are
intangible
herein
while
suffering
on
the
other
hand
appears
in
its
most
positive
form
among
the
different
factors
which
are
generally
supposed
to
be
more
or
less
productive
of
happiness
wealth
or
its
symbol
money
usually
represents
the
enchanted
wand
that
opens
the
gate
to
every
joy
of
life
it
is
true
that
we
have
seen
that
all
these
joys
were
illusions
and
that
their
pursuit
was
more
painful
than
pleasing
but
hartmann
here
makes
an
exception
in
favor
of
the
delights
which
art
and
science
procure
and
also
like
a
true
berlinois
of
those
which
the
table
affords
wealth
he
says
makes
me
lord
and
master
with
it
i
can
purchase
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
even
those
of
love
it
is
unnecessary
to
contend
with
him
on
this
point
our
tastes
all
differ
still
there
are
few
it
is
to
be
imagined
who
will
envy
him
in
an
affection
which
is
purchasable
with
coin
of
the
realm
moreover
wealth
does
not
make
one
lord
and
master
there
is
a
certain
charm
in
original
and
brilliant
conversation
which
neither
hartmann
nor
any
one
else
could
buy
even
though
all
the
wealth
of
ormus
and
the
ind
stood
to
his
credit
on
the
ledgers
of
the
landesbank
wealth
however
he
hastens
to
explain
should
be
valued
not
for
the
commodities
which
it
can
procure
but
rather
because
we
are
enabled
therewith
to
shield
ourselves
from
inconveniences
which
would
otherwise
disturb
that
zero
of
the
sensibility
which
the
pessimist
holds
to
be
the
nearest
approach
to
reality
in
happiness
it
is
said
that
the
drowning
man
will
clutch
at
a
straw
and
it
is
possible
that
the
reader
who
has
seen
his
illusions
dispersed
and
slaughtered
one
by
one
has
perhaps
deluded
himself
with
the
fancy
that
hope
at
least
might
yet
survive
if
he
has
done
so
he
may
be
sure
that
he
has
reckoned
without
his
host
hartmann
guillotines
the
blue
goddess
in
the
most
manner
she
is
the
last
on
the
list
and
he
does
the
job
with
a
hand
which
is
so
to
speak
well
in
of
course
hope
is
a
great
delight
who
thinks
of
denying
it
certainly
not
the
headsman
who
even
drops
a
sort
of
half
tear
over
her
mangled
wings
but
if
we
come
to
look
over
the
warrant
which
has
legalized
the
execution
the
question
naturally
arises
who
and
what
is
hope
it
is
of
little
use
to
ask
the
poets
for
they
are
all
astray
what
they
see
in
hope
is
a
fair
sky
girt
with
laurels
in
other
words
the
rape
of
happiness
but
has
it
not
been
repeated
even
to
satiety
that
happiness
does
not
exist
that
pain
outbalances
pleasure
what
is
hope
then
but
an
illusion
and
an
illusion
too
that
plays
all
manner
of
tricks
with
us
and
amuses
itself
at
our
expense
one
in
fact
which
makes
use
of
us
until
our
task
is
accomplished
and
we
understand
that
all
things
are
different
from
that
which
we
desired
he
then
hartmann
says
who
is
once
convinced
that
hope
is
as
vain
and
illusory
as
its
object
will
see
its
influence
gradually
wane
beneath
the
power
of
the
understanding
and
the
one
thing
to
which
he
will
then
look
forward
will
be
not
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
but
the
easiest
burden
of
pain
in
all
that
has
gone
before
hartmann
has
endeavored
to
show
that
suffering
increases
with
the
development
of
the
intellect
or
rather
that
happiness
exists
only
in
the
mineral
kingdom
which
represents
that
zero
of
the
senses
above
which
man
struggles
in
vain
it
has
been
seen
that
they
whose
nervous
systems
are
most
impressionable
have
a
larger
share
of
suffering
than
their
less
sensitive
brethren
furthermore
experience
teaches
that
the
lower
classes
are
more
contented
than
the
cultivated
and
the
rich
for
while
they
are
more
exposed
to
want
yet
they
are
and
more
obtuse
in
descending
the
scale
of
life
therefore
it
is
easy
to
show
that
such
weight
of
pain
as
burdens
animal
existence
is
less
than
that
which
man
supports
the
horse
whose
sensibility
is
most
delicate
leads
a
more
painful
existence
than
the
swine
or
even
the
fish
whose
happiness
at
high
tide
is
proverbial
the
life
of
the
fish
is
happier
than
that
of
the
horse
the
oyster
is
happier
than
the
fish
the
life
of
the
plant
is
happier
yet
and
so
on
down
to
the
last
degrees
of
organic
life
where
consciousness
expires
and
suffering
ends
the
balance
sheet
of
human
pleasure
and
pain
may
therefore
be
summed
up
somewhat
as
follows
in
the
first
column
stand
those
conditions
which
correspond
to
a
state
of
pure
indifference
and
merely
represent
the
absence
of
certain
sufferings
these
are
health
youth
liberty
and
in
the
second
are
those
which
stand
as
illusory
incentives
such
as
the
desire
for
wealth
power
esteem
and
general
regard
in
the
third
are
those
which
as
a
rule
cause
more
pain
than
pleasure
such
as
hunger
and
love
in
the
fourth
are
those
which
rest
on
illusions
such
as
hope
etc
in
the
fifth
are
those
which
recognized
as
misfortunes
are
only
accepted
to
escape
still
greater
ones
these
are
work
and
marriage
in
the
sixth
are
those
which
afford
more
pleasure
than
pain
but
whose
joys
must
be
paid
for
by
suffering
and
in
any
event
can
be
shared
but
by
the
few
this
is
the
column
of
art
and
science
let
a
line
be
drawn
and
the
columns
added
up
the
sum
total
amounts
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
pain
is
greatly
in
excess
of
pleasure
and
this
not
alone
in
the
average
but
in
the
particular
existence
of
each
individual
and
even
in
the
case
of
him
who
seems
exceptionally
favored
hartmann
has
taken
great
care
to
point
out
that
experience
demonstrates
the
vanity
of
each
of
the
opulent
aspirations
of
youth
and
that
on
the
subject
of
individual
happiness
intelligent
old
age
preserves
but
few
illusions
such
is
the
schedule
of
pleasure
and
pain
which
each
one
is
free
to
verify
by
his
own
experience
or
better
still
to
disregard
altogether
for
from
what
has
gone
before
it
is
easy
to
see
that
man
is
most
happy
when
he
is
the
unconscious
dupe
of
his
own
illusions
in
koheleth
it
is
written
to
add
to
knowledge
is
to
add
to
pain
he
then
whose
judgment
is
obscured
by
illusions
is
less
sensible
to
the
undeniable
miseries
of
life
he
is
always
prepared
to
welcome
hope
and
each
deception
is
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
better
things
micawber
whose
acquaintance
we
have
all
made
is
not
alone
a
type
but
a
lesson
the
moral
of
which
is
sometimes
overlooked
in
brief
hartmann
teaching
resolves
itself
into
the
doctrine
that
the
idea
that
happiness
is
obtainable
in
this
life
is
the
first
and
foremost
of
illusions
this
conclusion
in
spite
of
certain
eccentricities
of
statement
is
none
the
less
one
which
will
be
found
singularly
difficult
to
refute
but
every
question
has
two
different
sides
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
devil
whom
schopenhauer
painted
in
a
good
grim
gray
hartmann
has
daubed
all
over
with
a
depth
of
black
of
which
he
is
certainly
undeserving
and
not
only
that
but
he
has
taken
an
evident
pleasure
in
so
doing
it
is
not
therefore
unfair
to
use
his
own
weapon
and
tell
him
that
he
too
is
the
dupe
of
an
illusion
or
to
borrow
a
simile
from
the
prince
of
wits
to
insist
that
while
he
may
not
carry
any
unnecessary
quantity
of
motes
in
his
eye
some
dust
has
assuredly
settled
on
his
monocle
as
is
the
case
with
others
who
have
treated
the
subject
hartmann
confounds
the
value
of
the
existence
of
the
unit
with
the
worth
of
life
in
the
aggregate
taken
as
a
whole
it
is
undeniably
and
without
doubt
unfortunate
but
that
does
not
prevent
many
people
from
being
superlatively
and
to
the
pessimist
even
insultingly
happy
and
though
the
joy
of
a
lifetime
be
circumscribed
in
a
single
second
yet
it
is
not
rash
to
say
that
that
second
of
joy
may
be
so
vividly
intense
as
to
compensate
its
recipient
for
all
miseries
past
and
to
come
it
may
be
noted
further
that
the
which
has
just
been
reviewed
is
simply
a
resultant
of
hartmann
individual
opinion
sometimes
it
is
true
he
deals
with
unquestioned
facts
and
sometimes
with
unanswerable
figures
but
it
has
been
wittily
said
that
nothing
is
so
fallacious
as
facts
except
figures
and
certain
of
these
figures
and
facts
which
seem
to
bear
out
his
statements
are
found
at
times
to
be
merely
assertions
and
exaggerated
at
that
the
second
great
illusion
from
which
hartmann
would
deliver
us
is
the
belief
that
happiness
is
realizable
in
a
future
life
as
has
been
seen
he
has
already
contended
that
earthly
felicity
is
unobtainable
and
his
arguments
against
a
higher
state
are
in
a
word
that
unless
the
condition
which
follows
life
is
compared
to
the
anterior
state
of
being
chaos
the
successor
of
life
can
bring
to
man
neither
happiness
nor
unhappiness
but
as
the
belief
in
the
regeneration
of
the
body
is
no
longer
tenable
it
follows
that
this
contrast
can
not
be
appreciated
by
the
who
are
necessarily
without
thought
or
consciousness
this
doctrine
which
is
very
nearly
akin
to
buddhism
has
of
course
but
little
in
common
with
christianity
christianity
does
not
it
is
true
recognize
in
us
any
fee
simple
to
happiness
but
it
recommends
the
renunciation
of
such
as
may
be
held
that
the
value
of
the
transcendent
felicity
which
it
promises
may
be
heightened
to
a
still
greater
extent
it
was
this
regenerating
hope
this
association
of
a
disdain
for
life
to
a
promise
of
eternal
that
saved
antiquity
from
the
despair
and
distaste
for
life
in
which
it
was
being
slowly
consumed
but
according
to
the
tendency
of
modern
thought
every
effort
to
demonstrate
the
reality
of
ultramundane
happiness
only
results
in
a
more
or
less
disguised
and
fantastic
representation
of
nirvâna
while
the
idea
which
each
forms
of
such
a
condition
varies
naturally
with
the
degree
of
his
culture
it
is
certainly
not
at
all
astonishing
that
all
those
who
are
more
or
less
attached
to
the
christian
conception
of
life
should
as
hartmann
says
indignantly
repulse
any
and
every
suggestion
of
this
description
for
such
ideas
to
be
accepted
a
long
and
worldly
civilizing
preparation
is
needed
a
period
of
this
nature
is
found
in
his
analysis
of
the
third
and
last
great
illusion
which
holds
that
happiness
will
be
realizable
in
the
progressing
evolution
of
the
world
the
chapter
in
which
this
subject
is
treated
is
one
of
the
most
masterly
in
his
entire
work
and
as
such
is
well
deserving
of
careful
examination
first
it
may
be
explained
that
to
the
student
of
modern
science
the
history
of
the
world
is
that
of
a
continuous
and
immense
development
the
union
of
photometry
and
spectral
analysis
enables
him
to
follow
the
evolution
of
other
planets
while
chemistry
and
mineralogy
teach
him
something
of
the
earth
own
story
before
it
cooled
its
outer
crust
biology
discloses
the
evolution
of
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdom
archæology
with
some
assistance
from
other
sources
throws
an
intelligible
light
over
the
prehistoric
development
of
man
while
history
brings
with
it
the
reverberation
of
the
ordered
march
of
civilization
and
points
at
the
same
time
to
larger
and
grander
perspectives
it
is
not
hard
then
to
be
convinced
of
the
reality
of
progress
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
inability
to
present
it
to
self
in
a
thoroughly
unselfish
manner
from
an
egoist
point
of
view
man
and
by
man
is
meant
he
who
has
succeeded
in
divesting
himself
of
the
two
illusions
just
considered
would
condemn
life
not
only
as
a
useless
possession
but
as
an
affliction
he
has
however
hartmann
tells
him
a
rôle
to
fill
under
the
providential
direction
of
the
unconscious
which
in
conformity
with
the
plan
of
absolute
wisdom
draws
the
world
on
to
a
beneficent
end
and
this
rôle
exacts
that
he
shall
take
interest
in
and
joyously
sacrifice
himself
to
life
if
he
does
otherwise
his
loss
prevents
no
suffering
to
society
on
the
contrary
it
augments
the
general
discomfort
by
the
length
of
time
which
is
needed
to
replace
a
useful
member
man
may
not
then
as
schopenhauer
recommended
assist
as
a
passive
spectator
of
life
on
the
contrary
he
must
ceaselessly
act
work
and
produce
and
associate
himself
without
regret
in
the
economic
and
intellectual
development
of
society
or
in
other
words
he
must
lend
his
aid
to
the
attainment
of
the
supreme
goal
of
the
evolution
of
the
universe
for
that
there
is
a
goal
it
is
as
impossible
to
doubt
as
it
is
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
the
world
one
end
and
aim
is
to
turn
on
its
orbit
and
enjoy
the
varied
spectacle
of
pain
and
yet
what
is
this
goal
to
which
all
nature
tends
according
to
a
theory
which
nowadays
is
very
frequently
expressed
it
is
the
attainment
of
universal
happiness
through
gradual
advancement
and
progress
but
whatever
progress
humanity
may
realize
it
will
never
be
able
hartmann
affirms
to
do
away
with
nor
yet
diminish
those
most
painful
of
evils
illness
old
age
poverty
and
discontent
so
no
matter
to
how
great
an
extent
remedies
may
be
multiplied
disorders
and
especially
those
which
are
light
but
chronic
will
spread
with
a
progression
far
more
rapid
than
the
knowledge
of
therapeutics
the
gayety
of
youth
moreover
will
never
be
but
the
privilege
of
a
fraction
of
mankind
while
the
greater
part
will
continue
to
be
devoured
by
the
melancholy
of
old
age
the
poverty
of
the
masses
too
as
the
world
advances
becomes
more
and
more
formidable
for
all
the
while
the
masses
are
gaining
a
clearer
perception
of
their
misery
the
happiest
races
it
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
are
those
which
live
nearest
to
nature
as
do
the
savage
tribes
and
after
them
come
necessarily
the
civilized
nations
which
are
the
least
cultivated
historically
speaking
therefore
the
progress
of
civilization
corresponds
with
the
spread
of
general
nausea
may
it
not
be
then
as
kant
maintained
that
the
practice
of
universal
morality
is
the
great
aim
of
evolution
hartmann
considers
the
question
at
great
length
and
decides
in
the
negative
for
were
it
such
it
would
necessarily
expand
with
time
gain
ground
so
to
speak
and
take
a
firm
hold
on
the
different
classes
of
society
these
feats
of
course
it
has
not
performed
for
immorality
in
descending
the
centuries
has
changed
only
in
form
indeed
putting
aside
the
fluctuations
of
the
character
of
every
race
it
will
be
found
that
everywhere
the
same
connection
is
maintained
between
egotism
and
sympathy
if
one
is
shocked
at
the
cruelty
and
brutality
of
former
days
it
should
nevertheless
be
remembered
that
uprightness
sincerity
and
justice
were
the
characteristics
of
earlier
nations
who
shall
say
however
that
we
do
not
live
in
a
reign
of
falsehood
perfidy
and
the
coarsest
crimes
and
that
were
it
not
for
the
assured
execution
of
the
repressive
enactments
of
the
state
and
society
we
should
see
the
naked
brutality
of
the
barbarians
surge
up
again
among
us
for
that
matter
it
may
be
noted
that
at
times
it
does
reappear
in
all
its
human
bestiality
and
invariably
so
the
moment
that
law
and
order
are
in
any
way
weakened
or
destroyed
what
happened
in
the
draft
riots
in
new
york
and
in
paris
under
the
commune
since
morality
can
not
be
the
great
aim
of
evolution
perhaps
it
may
be
art
and
science
but
the
further
back
one
looks
the
more
does
scientific
progress
appear
to
be
the
exclusive
work
of
certain
rare
and
gifted
minds
while
the
nearer
one
approaches
the
present
epoch
the
more
collective
does
the
work
become
hartmann
points
out
that
the
first
thinkers
were
not
unlike
the
magicians
who
made
a
monument
rise
out
of
nothing
whereas
the
laborers
who
work
at
the
intellectual
edifice
of
the
present
day
are
but
corporations
of
intelligent
builders
who
each
according
to
their
strength
aid
in
the
construction
of
a
gigantic
tower
the
work
of
science
hereafter
will
he
says
be
broader
and
less
profound
it
will
become
exclusively
inductive
and
hence
the
demand
for
genius
will
grow
gradually
less
similarity
of
dress
has
already
blended
the
different
ranks
of
society
meanwhile
we
are
advancing
to
an
analogous
leveling
of
the
intelligence
which
will
result
in
a
common
but
solid
mediocrity
the
delight
in
scientific
production
will
gradually
wane
and
the
world
will
end
in
knowing
only
the
pleasures
of
passive
understanding
but
the
pleasure
of
knowledge
is
tasteless
when
truth
is
presented
like
a
cake
already
prepared
to
be
enjoyed
it
must
cost
an
effort
and
a
struggle
art
will
be
handicapped
in
much
the
same
manner
it
is
no
longer
now
what
it
was
for
the
youth
of
humanity
a
god
august
dispensing
happiness
with
open
hands
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
amusement
a
remedy
for
ennui
and
a
distraction
from
the
fatigues
of
the
day
hence
the
increase
of
dilettantism
and
the
neglect
of
serious
study
the
future
of
art
is
to
hartmann
age
has
no
ideal
or
rather
it
has
lost
what
it
had
and
art
is
condemned
in
the
increasing
years
of
humanity
to
hold
the
same
position
as
the
nightly
ballets
and
farces
now
do
to
the
bankers
and
brokers
of
large
cities
this
consistent
treatment
of
the
subject
hartmann
cleverly
founds
on
the
analogy
of
the
different
ages
of
the
life
of
the
individual
with
the
development
of
humanity
it
is
of
course
merely
a
series
of
affirmations
but
not
for
that
reason
necessarily
untrue
the
great
thinkers
have
disappeared
as
have
also
the
great
artists
and
they
have
done
so
hartmann
would
say
because
we
no
longer
need
them
indeed
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
could
the
greeks
come
back
they
would
tell
us
our
art
was
barbarous
even
to
the
casual
observer
it
has
retrograded
nor
is
it
alone
in
painting
and
sculpture
that
symptoms
of
decadence
are
noticeable
if
we
look
at
the
tendencies
in
literature
nothing
very
commendable
is
to
be
found
save
in
isolated
instances
where
the
technicalities
of
style
have
been
raised
very
near
to
perfection
but
apart
from
a
few
purists
who
can
in
no
sense
be
called
popular
the
majority
of
the
manufacturers
of
fiction
have
nothing
to
offer
but
froth
and
rubbish
the
modern
stage
too
brings
evidence
that
a
palpitant
tableau
is
more
appreciated
than
a
polished
comedy
and
the
tells
a
story
which
is
not
dissimilar
music
which
with
mozart
changed
its
sex
has
been
turned
into
a
harlot
by
offenbach
and
his
successors
and
there
are
but
few
nowadays
who
would
hesitate
between
don
juan
and
the
last
inanity
of
strauss
one
composer
however
of
incontestable
genius
has
been
slowly
fighting
his
way
into
the
hearts
of
cultivated
people
and
curiously
enough
has
sought
to
translate
with
an
orchestra
some
part
of
the
philosophy
of
pessimism
schopenhauer
it
is
said
shook
his
head
at
wagner
and
would
have
none
of
him
yet
if
schopenhauer
was
ever
wrong
he
was
certainly
wrong
in
that
for
wagner
has
expressed
as
no
one
will
do
again
the
flooding
rush
of
will
and
the
unspiritual
but
harmonious
voice
of
nature
but
whatever
may
become
of
art
science
is
not
to
be
dismissed
so
abruptly
practically
considered
the
political
social
and
industrial
advance
of
the
world
depends
entirely
on
its
progress
and
yet
from
hartmann
standpoint
all
that
has
been
accomplished
hitherto
by
the
aid
of
manufactories
steamships
railways
and
telegraphs
has
merely
served
to
lessen
the
embarrassments
which
compressed
the
activity
of
man
and
the
sole
advantage
which
society
has
reaped
by
their
aid
is
that
the
force
heretofore
expended
in
actual
labor
is
now
free
for
the
play
of
the
intellect
and
serves
to
hasten
the
evolution
of
the
world
this
result
hartmann
remarks
while
of
importance
to
general
progress
in
no
wise
affects
the
happiness
of
the
individual
this
last
statement
of
his
will
perhaps
be
better
understood
if
it
be
taken
into
consideration
that
the
increased
production
of
food
which
will
necessarily
follow
on
a
more
intelligent
culture
of
the
soil
will
greatly
augment
the
population
an
increase
of
population
will
multiply
the
number
of
those
who
are
always
on
the
verge
of
starvation
of
which
there
are
already
millions
but
an
advance
of
this
kind
while
a
step
backward
one
way
must
yet
be
a
step
forward
in
another
for
the
wealth
which
it
will
bring
in
its
train
will
necessarily
aid
in
diminishing
suffering
politically
considered
the
outlook
does
not
seem
to
be
much
more
assured
an
ideal
government
can
do
nothing
more
than
permit
man
to
live
without
fear
of
unjust
aggressions
and
enable
him
to
prepare
the
ground
on
which
he
may
construct
if
he
can
the
edifice
of
his
own
happiness
socially
the
result
will
be
about
the
same
through
solidarity
association
and
other
means
men
will
learn
how
to
make
the
struggle
of
the
individual
with
want
less
severe
yet
in
all
this
his
burdens
will
be
merely
lightened
and
positive
happiness
will
remain
unobtained
such
are
the
outlines
of
hartmann
conception
of
what
future
progress
will
amount
to
if
the
ideal
is
realized
man
will
be
gradually
raised
out
of
the
misery
in
which
he
is
plunged
and
little
by
little
approach
a
state
of
indifference
in
every
sphere
of
his
activity
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
ideal
is
ever
intangible
man
may
approach
but
he
can
never
reach
it
and
consequently
will
remain
always
in
a
state
of
suffering
in
this
manner
but
with
a
profusion
of
argument
which
if
not
always
convincing
is
yet
highly
instructive
hartmann
has
shown
in
brief
that
the
people
that
dwell
nearest
to
nature
are
happier
than
the
civilized
nations
that
the
poor
are
more
contented
than
the
rich
the
poor
in
spirit
more
blessed
than
the
intelligent
and
that
in
general
that
man
is
the
happiest
whose
sensibilities
are
the
most
obtuse
because
pleasure
is
then
less
dominated
by
pain
and
illusions
are
more
steadfast
and
complete
moreover
that
the
progress
of
humanity
develops
not
only
wealth
and
its
needs
and
consequently
discontent
but
also
the
aptitudes
and
culture
of
the
intellect
which
in
turn
awaken
man
to
the
consciousness
of
the
misery
of
life
and
in
so
doing
heighten
the
sentiment
of
general
misfortune
the
dream
that
another
golden
age
is
to
visit
the
earth
is
therefore
puerile
in
the
extreme
as
the
wayfarer
burden
grows
heavier
with
the
miles
so
do
humanity
suffering
and
the
consciousness
of
its
misery
continually
increase
the
child
lives
in
the
moment
the
adolescent
dreams
of
a
transcendent
ideal
man
aspires
to
glory
then
to
wealth
or
practical
wisdom
lastly
old
age
recognizing
the
vanity
of
all
things
holds
but
to
peace
and
bends
a
tired
head
to
rest
and
so
it
is
with
civilization
nations
rise
strengthen
and
disappear
humanity
by
unmistakable
signs
shows
that
it
is
on
the
wane
and
that
having
employed
its
strength
in
maturity
age
is
now
overtaking
it
in
time
it
will
be
content
to
live
on
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
the
centuries
and
inured
to
thought
it
will
review
the
collective
agitations
of
its
past
life
and
recognize
the
vanity
of
the
goal
hitherto
pursued
humanity
in
its
decline
will
leave
no
heir
to
profit
by
its
accumulated
wealth
it
will
have
neither
children
nor
grandchildren
to
trouble
the
rigor
of
its
judgment
through
the
illusions
of
parental
love
it
will
sink
finally
into
that
melancholy
which
is
the
appanage
of
great
minds
it
will
in
a
measure
float
above
its
own
body
like
a
spirit
freed
from
matter
or
as
œdipus
at
colonna
it
will
in
anticipation
taste
the
calm
of
chaos
and
assist
with
compassionate
at
the
spectacle
of
its
own
suffering
passions
that
have
vanished
into
the
depths
of
reason
will
be
resolved
into
ideas
by
the
white
light
of
thought
illusions
will
have
faded
and
hope
be
done
with
for
what
is
there
left
to
hope
its
highest
aim
can
be
but
the
absence
of
pain
for
it
can
no
longer
dream
of
happiness
still
weak
and
fragile
working
to
live
and
yet
not
knowing
why
it
does
so
it
will
ask
but
one
gift
the
rest
of
an
endless
sleep
that
shall
calm
its
weariness
and
immense
ennui
it
is
then
that
humanity
will
have
passed
through
the
three
periods
of
illusion
and
in
recognizing
the
nothingness
of
its
former
hopes
will
aspire
only
to
absolute
insensibility
and
the
chaos
of
nirvâna
it
remains
but
to
inquire
what
is
to
become
of
disillusionized
humanity
and
to
what
goal
evolution
is
tending
the
foregoing
account
of
hartmann
theory
should
have
shown
that
this
goal
can
not
be
happiness
for
at
no
period
has
it
ever
been
reached
and
moreover
that
with
the
progress
of
the
world
man
is
gaining
a
clearer
perception
of
his
misery
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
illogical
to
suppose
that
evolution
is
to
continue
with
no
other
aim
than
that
of
the
discharge
of
the
successive
moments
that
compose
it
for
if
each
of
these
moments
is
valueless
evolution
itself
would
be
meaningless
but
hartmann
it
may
be
remembered
has
recognized
in
the
unconscious
a
principle
of
absolute
wisdom
and
the
answer
must
be
looked
for
elsewhere
but
preferably
in
that
direction
which
most
noticeably
points
to
some
determined
and
progressive
perfection
no
such
sign
however
is
to
be
met
with
anywhere
save
in
the
development
of
consciousness
here
progress
has
been
clearly
and
uninterruptedly
at
work
from
the
appearance
of
the
first
globule
to
contemporaneous
humanity
and
in
all
probability
will
continue
to
advance
so
long
as
the
world
subsists
all
things
aid
in
its
production
and
development
while
to
its
assistance
there
come
not
only
the
perfecting
of
the
nervous
system
but
also
such
personal
incentives
as
the
desire
for
wealth
which
in
increasing
general
welfare
disfranchises
the
intellect
then
too
there
are
the
stimulants
to
intellectual
activity
vanity
and
ambition
and
also
sexual
love
which
heightens
its
aptitudes
in
short
every
instinct
which
is
valuable
to
the
species
and
which
costs
the
individual
more
pain
than
pleasure
is
converted
into
an
unalloyed
and
increasing
gain
for
consciousness
in
spite
of
all
this
however
the
development
of
consciousness
is
but
the
means
to
an
end
and
can
not
therefore
be
considered
as
an
absolute
goal
for
consciousness
hartmann
says
is
born
of
pain
and
exists
and
expands
with
suffering
and
yet
what
manner
of
consolation
does
it
offer
merely
a
vain
of
course
if
the
world
were
good
and
beautiful
this
would
not
be
without
its
advantage
but
a
world
which
is
absolutely
miserable
a
world
which
must
curse
its
own
existence
the
moment
it
is
able
to
judge
it
can
never
regard
its
apparent
and
purely
ideal
reflection
as
a
reasonable
goal
and
termination
of
its
existence
is
there
not
suffering
enough
in
reality
is
it
necessary
to
reproduce
it
in
a
magic
lantern
no
consciousness
can
not
be
the
supreme
goal
of
a
world
whose
evolution
is
directed
by
supreme
wisdom
some
other
end
must
be
sought
for
then
to
which
the
development
of
consciousness
shall
be
but
the
means
but
however
the
question
is
regarded
from
whatever
standpoint
the
matter
is
viewed
there
seems
to
be
but
one
possible
goal
and
that
is
happiness
everything
that
exists
tends
thereto
and
it
is
the
principle
on
which
rests
each
of
the
diverse
forms
of
practical
philosophy
moreover
the
pursuit
of
happiness
is
the
essence
of
will
seeking
its
own
pacification
but
happiness
has
been
shown
to
be
an
illusion
still
there
must
be
some
key
to
the
riddle
the
solution
is
at
once
simple
and
unexpected
there
can
be
no
positive
happiness
and
yet
happiness
of
some
kind
is
necessary
the
supreme
aim
of
universal
progress
of
which
consciousness
is
but
the
instrument
is
then
the
realization
of
the
highest
possible
felicity
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
freedom
from
all
pain
and
in
consequence
the
cessation
of
all
life
or
in
other
words
total
annihilation
this
climax
is
the
only
one
which
hartmann
will
consent
to
consider
from
any
other
point
of
view
evolution
would
be
a
tireless
which
some
day
might
be
blindly
arrested
by
chance
while
life
in
the
mean
time
would
remain
in
the
utter
desolation
of
an
issueless
purgatory
the
path
however
through
which
the
great
deliverance
is
to
be
effected
is
as
tortuously
perplexing
as
the
irrational
duality
of
the
unconscious
many
generations
of
pessimists
are
needed
before
the
world
will
be
fully
ripe
for
its
great
leap
into
the
night
of
time
even
then
though
hartmann
does
not
appear
to
suspect
it
there
will
probably
be
quite
a
number
of
pantheists
who
drunk
on
nature
will
stupidly
refuse
the
great
bare
bodkin
which
will
have
thus
been
carefully
prepared
for
their
viaticum
it
should
not
be
supposed
that
in
all
this
there
is
any
question
of
the
suicide
of
the
individual
hartmann
is
far
too
dramatic
to
suggest
a
final
tableau
so
tame
and
humdrum
as
that
besides
it
has
been
seen
that
the
death
of
the
individual
does
not
drag
with
it
the
disappearance
of
the
species
and
in
no
wise
disturbs
the
heedless
calm
of
nature
it
is
not
the
momentary
and
ephemeral
existence
that
is
to
be
destroyed
for
after
its
destruction
the
repairing
and
reproducing
force
would
still
survive
it
is
the
principle
of
existence
itself
which
must
be
extinguished
the
suicide
to
be
effectual
must
be
that
of
the
cosmos
this
proceeding
which
will
shortly
be
explained
will
be
the
act
of
the
last
moment
after
which
there
will
be
neither
will
nor
activity
after
which
to
quote
saint
john
will
have
ceased
to
be
but
here
it
may
be
pertinently
asked
whether
humanity
such
as
it
now
is
will
be
capable
of
this
grandiose
development
of
consciousness
which
is
to
prepare
the
absolute
renunciation
of
the
will
to
live
or
whether
some
superior
race
is
to
appear
on
earth
which
will
continue
the
work
and
attain
the
goal
may
it
not
be
that
the
globe
will
be
but
the
theatre
of
an
abortive
effort
of
this
description
and
long
after
it
has
gone
to
increase
the
number
of
frozen
spheres
some
other
planet
which
is
to
us
invisible
may
under
more
favorable
circumstances
realize
the
aim
and
end
to
this
the
answer
is
made
that
if
humanity
is
ever
destined
to
conduct
the
world
evolution
to
its
coronation
it
will
assuredly
not
complete
its
task
until
the
culminating
point
of
its
progress
has
been
reached
nor
yet
until
it
has
united
the
most
favorable
conditions
of
existence
we
need
not
however
bother
about
the
perspective
which
science
has
disclosed
and
which
points
to
a
future
period
of
congelation
and
complete
inertia
long
before
that
time
hartmann
says
evolution
will
have
ended
and
this
world
of
ours
with
its
continents
and
archipelagoes
will
have
vanished
the
manner
in
which
this
great
and
final
annihilation
is
to
be
accomplished
is
of
a
threefold
nature
the
first
condition
necessary
to
success
is
that
humanity
at
some
future
time
shall
concentrate
such
a
mass
of
will
that
the
balance
spread
about
elsewhere
over
the
world
will
be
insignificant
in
proportion
this
hartmann
explains
is
in
no
wise
impossible
for
the
manifestation
of
will
in
atomic
forces
is
greatly
inferior
to
that
which
is
exercised
in
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdom
and
hence
much
less
than
that
which
irrupts
in
man
the
supposition
therefore
that
the
greater
part
may
be
capitalized
in
man
is
not
necessarily
an
idle
dream
when
that
day
arrives
it
will
suffice
for
humanity
to
no
longer
will
to
live
to
annihilate
the
entire
fabric
for
humanity
will
at
that
time
represent
more
will
than
all
the
rest
of
nature
collectively
considered
the
second
condition
necessary
to
success
is
that
mankind
shall
be
so
thoroughly
alive
to
the
folly
of
life
so
imperiously
in
need
of
peace
and
shall
have
so
completely
disentangled
every
effort
from
its
aimlessness
that
the
yearning
for
an
end
to
existence
will
be
the
prime
motive
of
every
act
a
condition
such
as
this
hartmann
thinks
will
probably
be
realized
in
the
old
age
of
humanity
the
theory
that
life
is
an
evil
is
already
admitted
by
thinkers
the
supposition
therefore
that
it
may
some
day
triumph
over
the
prejudices
of
the
multitude
is
neither
absurd
nor
preposterous
as
is
shown
in
the
history
of
other
creeds
an
idea
may
penetrate
so
deeply
into
the
minds
of
its
adherents
as
to
breed
an
entire
race
of
fanatics
and
it
is
the
opinion
not
of
hartmann
alone
but
of
many
serious
and
cultivated
scholars
that
if
ever
an
idea
was
destined
to
triumph
without
recourse
to
either
passion
or
violence
and
to
exercise
at
the
same
time
an
action
purely
pacific
yet
so
profound
and
durable
as
to
assure
its
success
beforehand
that
idea
or
rather
that
sentiment
is
the
compassion
which
the
pessimist
feels
not
only
for
himself
but
for
everything
that
is
its
gradual
adoption
these
gentlemen
consider
not
as
problematical
but
merely
as
a
question
of
time
indeed
the
difficulty
is
not
so
great
as
might
be
supposed
every
day
the
will
of
the
individual
suffices
to
triumph
over
the
instinctive
love
of
life
and
hartmann
logically
argues
may
not
the
mass
of
humanity
do
the
same
thing
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
on
the
part
of
the
individual
is
it
is
true
barren
of
any
benefit
to
the
species
but
on
the
other
hand
a
universal
denial
would
result
in
complete
deliverance
mankind
however
has
yet
a
long
journey
before
it
and
many
generations
are
needed
to
overcome
and
to
dissipate
little
by
little
through
the
influence
of
heredity
those
passions
which
are
opposed
to
the
desire
for
eternal
peace
in
time
hartmann
thinks
all
this
will
be
brought
about
and
he
holds
moreover
that
the
development
of
consciousness
will
correspond
with
the
weakening
of
passion
which
is
to
be
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
decline
of
humanity
as
it
is
now
one
of
the
signs
of
the
day
the
third
condition
necessary
for
the
perfect
consummation
of
this
gigantic
suicide
is
that
communication
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
be
so
facilitated
that
they
may
simultaneously
execute
a
common
resolution
full
play
is
allowed
the
imagination
in
picturing
the
manner
in
which
all
this
is
to
be
accomplished
hartmann
has
a
contempt
for
details
and
contents
himself
with
asserting
that
it
is
necessary
and
possible
and
that
in
the
abdication
of
humanity
every
form
of
existence
will
cease
such
in
brief
is
this
vehement
conception
of
the
ordering
of
the
world
and
the
plan
for
its
precipitate
destruction
with
a
soldierly
disregard
of
objection
but
with
a
prodigality
of
argument
and
digression
which
if
not
always
substantial
is
unusually
vivid
hartmann
explains
the
unconscious
and
its
reacting
dualism
of
will
and
idea
one
principle
is
as
has
been
seen
constantly
irrupting
into
life
and
it
is
through
the
revolt
of
the
second
that
the
first
is
to
be
thwarted
and
extinguished
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
simple
and
it
would
be
a
graceless
and
pedantic
task
to
laboriously
clamber
to
the
same
vague
altitudes
to
which
hartmann
has
so
lightly
soared
and
there
contradict
his
description
of
the
perspective
to
any
one
who
has
cared
to
follow
the
writer
thus
far
the
outlines
given
of
hartmann
conspiracy
against
pain
must
have
seemed
aggressively
novel
schopenhauer
ideas
on
the
same
subject
were
seemingly
more
practical
if
less
lurid
but
then
schopenhauer
hugged
a
fact
and
flouted
chimeras
it
may
be
that
schopenhauer
was
a
little
behind
the
age
for
hartmann
has
criticised
him
very
much
as
a
collegian
on
a
holiday
might
jeer
at
the
manners
of
his
grandfather
as
they
can
not
both
be
right
each
may
be
wrong
and
it
may
be
that
the
key
to
the
whole
great
puzzle
is
contained
in
that
one
word
resignation
which
the
pronounced
so
long
ago
as
a
remedy
this
certainly
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
more
immediate
and
serviceable
palliative
to
the
sufferer
than
either
of
those
suggested
in
the
foregoing
systems
it
is
admitted
that
man
can
not
feed
and
be
fed
on
the
faith
of
baked
meat
and
it
is
in
the
same
manner
difficult
for
any
one
to
hypnotize
himself
and
his
suffering
with
the
assurance
that
in
the
decline
of
humanity
all
pain
will
cease
on
the
other
hand
whether
we
have
in
regard
to
future
generations
an
feeling
and
practically
care
very
little
whether
or
no
they
annihilate
themselves
and
pain
too
still
the
more
intelligent
will
readily
recognize
the
ubiquity
of
sorrow
and
consider
resignation
at
present
as
its
most
available
salve
but
in
spite
of
its
vagaries
pessimism
as
expounded
by
schopenhauer
and
hartmann
possesses
a
real
and
enduring
value
which
it
is
difficult
to
talk
away
it
is
naturally
most
easy
to
laugh
in
the
heyday
of
youth
and
health
at
its
fantastic
misanthropy
indeed
it
is
in
no
sense
perfect
it
has
halted
and
tripped
many
times
it
has
points
that
even
to
the
haphazard
and
indifferent
spectator
are
weak
and
faulty
and
yet
what
creed
is
logically
perfect
and
what
creed
is
impregnable
to
criticism
that
there
is
none
such
can
be
truly
admitted
the
reader
then
may
well
afford
to
be
a
little
patient
with
pessimism
theoretically
it
is
still
in
its
infancy
but
with
increasing
years
its
blunders
will
give
way
to
strength
and
though
many
of
the
theories
that
it
now
holds
may
alter
the
cardinal
uncontrovertible
tenet
that
life
is
a
burden
will
remain
firm
and
changeless
to
the
end
of
time
chapter
vi
is
life
an
affliction
in
very
stately
words
that
were
typical
of
him
who
uttered
them
emerson
said
i
do
not
wish
to
be
amused
and
turned
therewith
a
figurative
back
on
the
enticements
of
the
commonplace
broadly
speaking
the
sentiment
that
prompted
this
expression
is
common
to
all
individual
men
the
allurements
and
charms
of
the
world
are
attractive
to
the
vulgar
but
not
to
the
thinker
and
whether
the
thinker
be
a
trappist
or
a
comedian
he
will
if
called
to
account
express
himself
in
a
manner
equally
frank
for
sentiments
of
this
description
neither
orthodoxy
nor
pessimism
is
to
blame
they
are
merely
the
resultants
of
the
obvious
and
the
true
they
leap
into
being
in
every
intelligent
mind
the
holiday
crowd
on
its
way
to
the
derby
to
coney
island
the
lido
or
to
any
one
of
the
other
thousand
places
of
popular
resort
causes
even
the
ordinary
observer
to
wonder
why
it
is
that
he
can
not
go
too
and
enjoy
himself
with
the
same
boisterous
good
humor
which
palpitates
all
about
him
he
thinks
at
first
that
he
has
some
fibre
lacking
some
incapacity
for
that
enjoyment
which
has
in
so
large
a
measure
been
given
to
others
but
little
by
little
the
conviction
breaks
upon
him
that
he
has
a
fibre
more
and
that
it
is
the
others
who
lack
the
finer
perceptions
with
which
he
is
burdened
that
the
others
are
to
be
envied
and
he
to
be
pitied
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
but
all
the
same
the
fact
that
he
is
unable
to
take
part
in
popular
amusements
steadfastly
remains
and
while
the
matter
of
the
extra
fibre
is
more
or
less
reassuring
it
is
not
always
perfectly
satisfactory
and
he
then
begins
to
look
about
for
the
reason
if
to
his
power
of
observation
there
be
added
also
a
receptive
mind
and
an
introspective
eye
it
will
be
unnecessary
for
him
to
have
ever
heard
of
renan
to
become
gradually
aware
that
he
is
the
victim
of
a
gigantic
swindle
in
common
with
many
others
he
has
somehow
imagined
that
the
world
was
a
broad
and
fertile
plain
with
here
and
there
a
barren
tract
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
give
any
reason
for
this
fancy
in
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulation
is
the
explicit
warning
of
the
founder
of
christianity
and
to
this
warning
all
creeds
save
that
of
the
early
hellenists
concur
it
did
not
therefore
come
from
any
religious
teaching
nor
for
that
matter
from
any
philosophy
still
the
impression
however
vague
it
may
seem
when
analyzed
has
none
the
less
been
with
him
as
with
all
others
the
reason
being
simply
that
he
grew
up
with
it
as
he
may
have
grown
up
with
fairy
tales
and
it
is
not
until
his
aspirations
stumble
over
facts
that
he
begins
to
see
that
life
instead
of
being
the
pleasant
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
which
he
had
imagined
is
in
reality
something
entirely
different
these
deductions
of
course
need
not
follow
because
a
man
finds
that
he
is
more
or
less
indifferent
to
every
form
of
entertainment
from
a
king
revel
to
a
but
they
may
follow
of
any
man
who
has
begun
to
dislike
the
propinquity
of
the
average
and
to
feel
that
where
the
crowd
find
amusement
there
will
be
nothing
but
weariness
and
vexation
of
spirit
for
him
under
such
circumstances
he
is
an
instinctive
pessimist
and
one
who
needs
but
little
theoretic
instruction
to
learn
that
he
as
all
others
has
been
made
use
of
and
cheated
to
boot
the
others
it
is
true
are
generally
speaking
unaware
of
the
deception
that
has
been
practiced
on
them
they
have
it
may
be
a
few
faint
suspicions
that
something
has
gone
wrong
somewhere
but
even
in
uttermost
depression
the
untutored
look
upon
their
misfortunes
as
purely
individual
and
unshared
by
the
world
at
large
of
the
universality
of
suffering
of
the
fact
as
john
stuart
mill
has
put
it
that
there
is
no
happiness
for
nineteen
twentieths
of
the
world
inhabitants
few
have
any
conception
or
idea
they
look
it
may
be
over
their
garden
wall
and
hearing
their
neighbor
grumble
they
think
that
being
and
his
life
is
not
one
of
unalloyed
delight
but
their
vision
extends
no
further
they
do
not
see
the
sorrow
that
has
no
words
nor
do
they
hear
the
silent
knell
of
irrecoverable
though
unuttered
hopes
the
toil
of
heart
and
knees
and
hands
of
all
these
things
they
know
nothing
household
worries
and
those
of
their
neighbor
and
his
wife
circle
their
existence
if
they
are
not
contented
themselves
then
happiness
is
but
a
question
of
distance
another
street
or
another
town
or
another
country
holds
it
and
if
the
change
is
made
the
old
story
remains
to
be
repeated
there
are
those
too
who
from
dyspepsia
torpidity
of
the
liver
or
general
crankiness
of
disposition
are
inclined
to
take
a
gloomy
view
of
all
things
then
there
is
a
temperamental
pessimism
which
displays
itself
in
outbursts
of
indignation
against
the
sorrows
of
life
and
in
frantic
struggles
with
destiny
and
the
meshes
of
personal
existence
there
is
also
the
sullen
pessimism
of
despair
noticeable
in
the
quiet
folding
of
hands
and
which
with
tearless
eyes
awaits
death
without
complaint
then
there
are
those
who
complain
and
sulk
who
torment
themselves
and
others
and
who
have
neither
the
spunk
to
struggle
nor
the
grace
to
be
resigned
this
is
the
there
is
also
a
haphazard
pessimism
which
comes
of
an
unevenness
of
disposition
and
which
asserts
itself
on
a
rainy
day
or
when
stocks
are
down
another
is
the
accidental
type
the
man
who
with
loss
of
wife
child
or
mistress
settles
himself
in
a
dreary
misanthropy
finally
there
is
hypochondria
which
belongs
solely
to
pathology
in
none
of
these
categories
do
the
victims
have
any
suspicion
that
a
philosophical
significance
is
attached
to
their
suffering
curiously
enough
however
it
is
from
one
or
from
all
of
these
different
classes
that
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
pessimism
is
derived
it
is
these
forms
that
are
met
with
in
life
and
literature
and
yet
it
is
precisely
with
these
types
that
spring
from
the
disposition
and
temperament
of
the
individual
who
exhibits
them
that
scientific
pessimism
has
nothing
to
do
it
ignores
them
entirely
broadly
stated
scientific
pessimism
in
its
most
advanced
form
rests
on
a
denial
that
happiness
in
any
form
ever
has
been
or
ever
will
be
obtained
either
by
the
individual
as
a
unit
or
by
the
world
as
a
whole
and
this
for
the
reason
that
life
is
not
considered
as
a
pleasant
gift
made
to
us
for
our
pleasure
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
duty
which
must
be
performed
by
sheer
force
of
labor
a
task
which
in
greater
matters
as
in
small
brings
in
its
train
a
misery
which
is
general
an
effort
which
is
ceaseless
and
a
tension
of
mind
and
body
which
is
extreme
and
often
unbearable
work
torment
pain
and
misery
are
held
to
be
the
unavoidable
lot
of
nearly
every
one
and
the
work
torment
pain
and
misery
of
life
are
considered
as
necessary
to
mankind
as
the
keel
to
the
ship
indeed
were
it
otherwise
were
wishes
when
formed
fulfilled
in
what
manner
would
the
time
be
employed
imagine
the
earth
to
be
a
fairyland
where
all
grows
of
itself
where
birds
fly
roasted
to
the
spit
and
where
each
would
find
his
heart
best
love
wreathed
with
orange
flowers
to
greet
his
coming
what
would
the
result
be
some
would
bore
themselves
to
death
some
would
cut
their
throats
while
others
would
quarrel
assassinate
and
cause
generally
more
suffering
than
is
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
actually
imposed
upon
them
pain
is
not
the
accident
but
the
necessary
and
inevitable
concomitant
of
life
and
the
attractiveness
of
the
promise
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
is
in
consequence
somewhat
impaired
nor
according
to
scientific
pessimism
is
there
any
possibility
that
happiness
will
be
obtained
in
a
future
life
in
this
there
is
no
atheism
though
the
arguments
that
follow
may
seem
to
savor
of
the
agnostic
as
has
been
seen
pleasures
are
as
a
rule
indirect
being
cessations
or
alleviations
of
pain
if
it
be
taken
for
granted
that
in
a
future
life
there
will
be
no
pain
the
difficulty
is
not
overcome
but
rather
increased
by
the
fact
of
the
rapid
exhaustion
of
nervous
susceptibility
to
pleasure
furthermore
as
without
brain
there
is
no
consciousness
it
will
not
be
illogical
to
suppose
that
every
spirit
must
be
provided
with
such
an
apparatus
in
which
case
the
psychological
laws
in
the
other
life
must
be
strictly
analogous
to
those
of
early
experience
the
deduction
follows
of
itself
there
too
must
be
pain
and
sorrow
to
this
it
may
be
objected
that
in
a
future
life
there
need
be
no
question
either
of
pain
or
pleasure
and
that
the
ransomed
soul
will
in
contemplation
or
love
or
the
practice
of
morality
be
too
refined
to
be
susceptible
to
any
sensations
of
a
grosser
nature
to
all
this
advanced
pessimism
has
a
ready
answer
first
there
can
be
no
morality
for
where
there
is
no
body
and
no
property
it
is
impossible
to
injure
another
second
there
can
be
no
love
for
every
form
of
love
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
rests
on
the
basis
of
sensibility
when
therefore
after
the
abstraction
of
shape
voice
features
and
all
bodily
actions
that
are
manifested
through
the
medium
of
the
brain
nothing
but
an
unsubstantial
shadow
remains
what
is
there
left
to
love
third
there
can
be
no
contemplation
for
in
a
state
of
clairvoyance
contemplation
is
certainly
useless
in
these
arguments
pessimism
it
may
be
noted
does
not
deny
the
possibility
of
future
existence
it
denies
merely
the
possibility
of
future
happiness
and
its
logic
of
course
can
in
no
wise
affect
the
position
of
those
who
hold
that
man
is
unable
to
conceive
or
imagine
anything
of
that
which
is
or
is
not
to
be
from
a
religious
standpoint
advanced
pessimism
teaches
that
the
misery
of
life
is
immedicable
and
strips
away
every
illusion
with
which
it
has
been
hitherto
enveloped
it
offers
it
is
true
no
hope
that
a
future
felicity
will
be
the
recompense
of
present
suffering
and
if
in
this
way
it
ignores
any
question
of
reward
and
punishment
it
does
not
for
that
reason
necessarily
open
a
gate
to
license
and
immorality
on
the
contrary
pessimism
stands
firmly
to
the
first
principle
of
the
best
ethics
and
holds
that
men
shall
do
good
without
the
wish
to
be
rewarded
and
abstain
from
evil
without
the
fear
of
being
punished
in
regard
to
what
follows
death
it
recognizes
in
the
individual
but
the
aspiration
to
be
liberated
from
the
task
of
coöperating
in
evolution
the
desire
to
be
replunged
in
the
universal
spirit
and
the
wish
to
disappear
therein
as
the
raindrop
disappears
in
the
ocean
or
as
the
flame
of
the
lamp
is
extinguished
in
the
wind
in
other
words
it
does
not
aim
at
mere
happiness
but
at
peace
and
at
rest
and
meanwhile
until
the
hour
of
deliverance
is
at
hand
it
does
not
acquit
the
individual
of
any
of
the
obligations
that
he
owes
to
society
nor
of
one
that
is
due
to
himself
in
short
the
creed
as
it
stands
is
one
of
charity
and
to
all
men
and
apart
from
its
denial
of
future
happiness
it
does
not
in
its
ethics
differ
in
any
respect
from
the
sublime
teachings
of
the
christian
faith
it
seems
trite
to
say
that
we
are
passing
through
a
transition
period
for
all
things
seem
to
point
to
a
coming
change
still
whatever
alterations
time
may
bring
in
its
train
it
is
difficult
to
affirm
that
the
belief
here
set
forth
is
to
be
the
religion
of
the
future
pas
prophète
qui
in
any
event
it
is
easy
to
prove
that
pessimism
is
not
a
religion
of
the
past
its
very
youth
militates
most
against
it
and
while
it
may
outgrow
this
defect
yet
it
has
other
objectionable
features
which
to
the
average
mind
are
equally
unassuring
to
begin
with
it
is
essentially
iconoclastic
wherever
it
rears
its
head
it
does
so
amid
a
swirl
of
vanishing
illusions
and
a
totter
and
crash
of
superstition
there
are
few
however
that
part
placidly
with
these
possessions
illusions
are
relinquished
grudgingly
and
as
for
superstitions
a
wise
man
has
said
are
they
not
hopes
it
would
seem
then
that
in
showing
the
futility
of
any
quest
of
happiness
here
or
hereafter
this
doctrine
if
received
at
all
will
have
performed
a
very
thankless
task
indeed
it
is
this
reason
if
no
other
that
will
cause
it
for
some
time
to
come
to
be
regarded
with
distrust
and
dislike
the
masses
are
conservative
and
their
conservatism
usually
holds

one
or
two
centuries
in
arrears
of
advancing
thought
and
even
putting
the
masses
out
of
the
question
one
has
to
be
very
hospitable
to
receive
truth
at
all
times
as
a
welcome
guest
for
truth
is
certainly
very
naked
and
uncompromising
we
love
to
sigh
for
it
béranger
said
and
it
may
be
added
most
of
us
stop
there
pessimism
moreover
seemingly
takes
and
gives
nothing
in
return
but
if
it
is
examined
more
closely
it
will
be
found
that
its
very
melancholy
transforms
itself
into
a
consolation
which
if
relatively
restricted
is
none
the
less
valuable
taubert
one
of
its
most
vigorous
expounders
says
not
only
does
it
carry
the
imagination
far
beyond
the
actual
suffering
to
which
every
one
is
condemned
and
in
this
manner
shield
us
from
manifold
deceptions
but
it
even
increases
such
pleasures
as
life
still
holds
and
doubles
their
intensity
for
pessimism
while
showing
that
each
joy
is
an
illusion
leaves
pleasure
where
it
found
it
and
simply
incloses
it
in
a
black
border
from
which
in
greater
relief
it
shines
more
brightly
than
before
another
objection
which
has
been
advanced
against
pessimism
is
that
it
is
a
creed
of
quietist
inactivity
such
however
it
can
no
longer
be
considered
for
if
it
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
its
recent
developments
it
will
be
found
to
be
above
all
other
beliefs
the
one
most
directly
interested
in
the
progress
of
evolution
pessimism
it
may
be
remembered
came
into
general
notice
not
more
than
years
ago
at
that
time
it
aroused
in
certain
quarters
a
horrified
dislike
in
others
it
was
welcomed
with
passionate
approval
books
and
articles
were
written
for
and
against
it
in
much
the
same
manner
that
books
and
articles
leaped
into
print
in
defense
and
abuse
of
the
theory
generally
connected
with
darwin
name
since
then
the
tumult
has
gradually
calmed
down
on
the
one
hand
pessimism
is
accepted
as
a
fact
on
the
other
new
expositors
less
dogmatic
than
their
great
predecessor
and
with
an
equipment
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
advance
in
knowledge
prune
the
original
doctrine
and
strengthen
it
with
fresh
and
vigorous
thought
among
these
and
directly
after
hartmann
taubert
takes
the
highest
rank
this
writer
recognizes
the
truth
of
schopenhauer
theory
that
progress
brings
with
it
a
clearer
consciousness
of
the
misery
of
existence
and
the
illusion
of
happiness
but
at
the
same
time
much
emphasis
is
laid
on
the
possibility
of
triumphing
over
this
misery
through
a
subjugation
of
the
selfish
propensities
it
is
in
this
way
taubert
considers
that
peace
may
be
attained
or
at
least
the
burden
of
life
noticeably
diminished
the
bleakness
in
which
hartmann
lodged
the
unconscious
is
through
this
treatment
rendered
if
not
comfortable
at
least
inhabitable
but
while
in
this
manner
taubert
plays
the
upholsterer
another
exponent
wanders
through
the
shadowy
terraces
of
thought
and
in
so
doing
looks
about
him
with
the
grim
suavity
of
a
sheriff
seeking
a
convenient
spot
on
which
to
clap
a
bill
of
sale
this
writer
julius
bahnsen
is
best
known
through
his
philosophy
of
history
and
a
recent
publication
the
tragic
as
the
world
first
law
whose
repulsively
attractive
title
sent
a
fresh
ripple
eddying
through
the
seas
of
literature
in
these
works
the
extreme
of
pessimism
may
be
said
to
have
been
reached
for
not
only
does
their
author
vie
with
schopenhauer
in
representing
the
world
as
a
ceaseless
torment
which
the
absolute
has
imposed
on
itself
but
he
goes
a
step
further
and
in
denying
that
there
is
any
finality
even
immanent
in
nature
asserts
that
the
order
of
phenomena
is
utterly
illogical
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
one
pure
delight
which
schopenhauer
admitted
was
that
of
intellectual
contemplation
that
blessed
mood
in
which
the
burden
of
the
mystery
in
which
the
heavy
and
the
weary
weight
of
all
this
unintelligible
world
is
lightened
but
from
bahnsen
standpoint
inasmuch
as
the
universe
is
totally
lacking
in
order
or
harmonious
design
since
it
is
but
the
dim
cavernous
abode
of
unrelated
phenomena
and
forms
the
pleasure
which
schopenhauer
admitted
so
far
from
causing
enjoyment
is
simply
a
source
of
anguish
to
the
intelligent
and
reflective
mind
even
the
hope
of
final
annihilation
which
schopenhauer
suggested
and
hartmann
planned
has
brought
to
him
but
cold
comfort
he
puts
it
aside
as
a
pleasant
and
idle
dream
to
him
the
misery
of
the
world
is
permanent
and
unalterable
and
the
universe
nothing
but
will
rending
itself
in
eternal
and
unending
torment
beyond
this
it
is
difficult
to
go
few
have
cared
to
go
even
so
far
and
the
bravado
and
vagaries
of
this
doctrine
have
not
been
such
as
to
cause
anything
more
than
a
success
of
curiosity
indeed
views
have
been
mentioned
here
simply
as
being
a
part
of
the
history
though
not
of
the
development
of
advanced
pessimism
and
they
may
now
very
properly
be
relegated
to
the
night
to
which
they
belong
to
sum
up
then
what
has
gone
before
the
modern
pessimist
is
a
buddhist
who
has
strayed
from
the
orient
and
who
in
his
exodus
has
left
behind
him
all
his
fantastic
shackles
and
has
brought
with
him
together
with
ethical
laws
only
the
cardinal
tenet
life
is
evil
broadly
considered
the
difference
between
the
two
creeds
is
not
important
the
buddhist
aspires
to
a
universal
nothingness
and
the
pessimist
to
the
moment
when
in
the
face
of
nature
he
may
cry
oh
quelle
immense
joie
après
tant
de
souffrance
à
travers
les
débris
les
charniers
pouvoir
enfin
jeter
ce
cri
de
délivrance
sous
le
ciel
nous
sommes
les
derniers
beyond
this
difference
the
main
principles
of
the
two
beliefs
vary
only
with
the
longitude
the
old
yet
still
infant
east
demands
a
fable
to
which
the
young
yet
practical
west
turns
an
inattentive
ear
eliminate
palingenesis
and
the
steps
by
which
nirvâna
is
attained
and
the
two
creeds
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
precisely
the
same
of
the
two
buddhism
is
of
course
the
stronger
it
appeals
more
to
the
imagination
and
less
to
facts
indeed
numerically
speaking
its
strength
is
greater
than
that
of
any
other
belief
according
to
the
most
recent
statistics
the
world
holds
about
jews
mohammedans
brahmins
christians
and
buddhists
the
remainder
being
pagans
positivists
agnostics
and
atheists
within
the
last
few
years
buddhism
has
spread
into
russia
and
from
there
into
germany
england
and
the
united
states
and
wherever
it
spreads
it
paves
in
its
passing
the
way
for
pessimism
the
number
of
pessimists
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
compute
instinctive
pessimists
abound
everywhere
but
however
limited
the
number
of
theoretic
pessimists
may
be
their
literature
at
least
is
daily
increasing
for
the
last
twenty
years
it
may
safely
be
said
that
not
a
month
has
gone
by
unmarked
by
some
fresh
contribution
and
the
most
recent
developments
of
french
and
german
literature
show
that
the
countless
arguments
pleas
and
replies
which
the
subject
has
called
forth
have
brought
instead
of
exhaustion
a
new
and
expanded
vigor
the
most
violent
opposition
that
pessimism
has
had
to
face
has
come
curiously
enough
from
the
socialists
for
the
socialists
while
pessimists
as
to
the
present
have
optimistic
views
for
the
future
their
cry
is
not
against
the
misery
of
the
world
but
against
the
capital
that
produces
it
the
artisan
they
say
is
smothered
by
the
produce
of
his
own
hands
the
more
he
produces
the
more
he
increases
the
capital
that
is
choking
him
down
in
time
marx
says
there
will
exist
only
a
few
magnates
face
to
face
with
a
huge
enslaved
population
and
as
wealth
increases
in
geometric
proportion
so
will
poverty
and
with
it
the
exasperation
of
the
multitude
then
the
explosion
is
to
come
and
socialism
to
begin
its
sway
now
socialism
does
not
as
is
generally
supposed
preach
community
of
goods
it
preaches
simply
community
of
profits
and
the
abolition
of
capital
as
a
productive
agent
when
the
explosion
comes
therefore
the
socialists
propose
to
turn
the
state
into
one
vast
and
comprehensive
guild
to
which
all
productive
capital
land
and
factories
shall
appertain
the
right
of
inheritance
of
personal
property
it
may
be
noted
will
be
retained
and
this
for
a
variety
of
reasons
of
which
the
most
satisfactory
seems
to
be
that
such
a
right
serves
as
an
incentive
to
economy
and
activity
money
may
be
saved
and
descend
but
it
is
not
to
be
allowed
the
power
of
generation
it
will
be
readily
understood
even
from
this
brief
summary
that
such
a
doctrine
as
hartmann
which
is
chiefly
concerned
in
disproving
the
value
of
every
aspect
of
progress
was
certain
to
call
out
many
replies
from
those
who
see
a
vast
area
for
the
expansion
of
human
comfort
and
happiness
in
the
future
developments
of
social
life
to
these
replies
the
pessimists
have
but
one
rejoinder
and
that
is
that
any
hope
of
the
expansion
of
happiness
is
an
illusion
and
is
it
an
illusion
simple
winthrop
said
if
us
as
knows
so
little
can
see
a
bit
o
good
and
rights
we
may
be
sure
as
there
a
good
and
a
rights
better
nor
what
we
knows
of
but
then
winthrop
was
admittedly
simple
and
her
views
in
consequence
are
hardly
those
of
the
seer
from
an
endæmonist
standpoint
the
world
does
not
seem
to
be
much
better
off
now
than
it
was
two
or
three
thousand
years
ago
there
are
even
some
who
think
it
has
retrograded
and
who
turn
to
the
civilization
of
greece
and
rome
with
longing
regret
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
from
the
peace
and
splendor
of
these
nations
cries
of
distress
have
descended
to
us
which
are
fully
as
acute
as
any
that
have
been
uttered
in
recent
years
truly
to
the
student
of
history
each
epoch
brings
its
own
shudder
there
have
been
ameliorations
in
one
way
and
pacifications
in
another
but
misery
looms
in
tireless
constancy
through
it
all
each
year
a
fresh
discovery
seems
to
point
to
still
better
things
in
the
future
but
progress
is
as
undeniably
the
chimera
of
the
present
century
as
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
was
that
of
the
tenth
each
age
has
its
own
for
no
matter
to
what
degree
of
perfection
industry
may
arrive
and
to
whatever
heights
progress
may
ascend
it
must
yet
touch
some
final
goal
and
meanwhile
pessimism
holds
that
with
expanding
intelligence
there
will
come
little
by
little
the
fixed
and
immutable
knowledge
that
of
all
perfect
things
which
the
earth
contains
misery
is
the
most
complete
to
question
whether
life
is
an
affliction
seems
from
the
facts
and
arguments
already
presented
to
be
somewhat
unnecessary
the
answer
appears
in
a
measure
to
be
a
foregone
conclusion
yet
if
the
question
be
examined
without
bias
and
without
prejudice
the
issue
is
not
only
doubtful
but
difficult
to
ascertain
if
in
any
intelligent
community
the
matter
were
put
to
vote
by
acclamation
the
decision
would
undoubtedly
be
in
the
negative
and
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons
first
and
foremost
of
which
is
that
ninety
and
nine
out
of
a
hundred
persons
are
led
by
the
thread
of
external
appearance
and
whatever
their
private
beliefs
may
be
they
still
wish
their
neighbors
to
think
that
they
at
least
have
no
cause
to
complain
it
is
this
desire
to
appear
well
in
the
eyes
of
others
that
makes
what
is
termed
the
and
which
prevents
so
many
proud
yet
vulgar
minds
from
avowing
their
true
position
indeed
there
are
few
who
save
to
an
intimate
have
the
courage
to
acknowledge
that
they
are
miserable
there
is
at
work
within
them
the
same
instinct
that
compels
the
wounded
animal
to
seek
the
depths
of
the
bushes
in
which
to
die
people
generally
are
ashamed
of
grief
and
turn
to
hide
a
tear
as
the
sensitive
turn
from
an
accident
in
the
street
and
veil
their
eyes
from
deformity
moreover
it
is
largely
customary
to
mock
at
the
melancholy
and
in
good
society
it
is
an
unwritten
law
that
every
one
shall
bring
a
certain
quota
of
contentment
and
gayety
or
else
remain
in
chambered
solitude
added
to
this
and
beyond
the
insatiable
desire
to
appear
serene
and
successful
in
the
eyes
of
others
there
is
the
terrible
dread
of
seeming
to
be
cheated
and
outwitted
of
that
which
is
apparently
a
universal
birthright
and
according
to
a
general
conception
there
is
the
same
sort
of
moral
baseness
evidenced
in
an
unuttered
yet
visible
appeal
for
sympathy
as
that
which
is
at
work
in
the
outstretched
palm
many
it
is
true
there
are
who
drop
the
furtive
coin
but
the
world
at
large
passes
with
averted
stare
there
is
work
for
all
is
a
common
saying
and
for
the
infirm
there
are
hospitals
and
institutions
what
then
is
the
use
of
giving
it
is
queried
and
the
answer
follows
they
who
ask
for
alms
are
frauds
if
the
alms
be
taken
to
stand
for
sympathy
the
frauds
will
be
found
to
be
few
and
far
between
for
if
each
man
and
woman
who
has
arrived
at
the
age
of
reason
at
that
age
in
fact
which
is
not
such
as
is
set
by
the
statute
but
which
each
individual
case
makes
for
itself
if
each
one
should
have
his
heart
first
wrung
dry
and
then
dissected
there
would
be
such
an
expanse
and
prodigality
of
sorrow
discovered
as
would
defy
an
index
and
put
a
library
to
shame
if
the
tendency
of
current
literature
is
examined
it
will
be
found
to
point
very
nearly
the
same
way
in
earlier
days
the
novel
ended
with
the
union
of
two
young
people
and
the
curtain
fell
on
a
tableau
of
awaited
happiness
nowadays
however
as
the
french
phrase
goes
we
have
changed
all
that
realistic
fiction
is
a
picture
of
life
as
it
is
and
not
as
was
formerly
the
case
a
picture
of
life
as
we
want
it
probably
the
strongest
and
most
typical
romance
of
recent
american
authors
is
the
portrait
of
a
lady
and
this
picture
of
a
thoroughbred
girl
awake
to
the
highest
possibilities
of
life
ends
not
only
in
her
entire
disenchantment
but
also
if
i
have
understood
james
aright
in
her
utter
degradation
in
that
very
elaborate
novel
daniel
deronda
the
moral
drawn
is
not
dissimilar
and
yet
its
author
stood
at
the
head
of
english
fiction
in
french
literature
the
same
influence
is
even
more
noticeably
at
work
it
is
the
fashion
to
abuse
zola
and
to
say
that
his
works
are
obscene
so
they
are
and
so
is
the
life
that
he
depicts
but
his
descriptions
are
true
to
the
letter
and
the
gaunt
and
wanton
misery
which
he
described
in
is
not
to
my
thinking
such
as
one
need
blush
over
but
rather
such
as
might
well
cause
tears
the
work
which
those
princes
of
literature
the
goncourts
and
daudet
have
performed
has
been
prepared
as
one
may
say
with
pens
pricked
in
sorrow
germanie

la

jack
the
nabab
and
the

are
but
one
cry
of
variegated
yet
agony
in
this
respect
tourguénieff
was
well
up
to
the
age
as
is
also
spielhagen
who
is
very
generally
considered
to
be
the
best
of
german
novelists
the
splendid
wickedness
of
mediæval
italy
has
done
little
to
inspire
her
modern
authors
the
romances
most
abundant
there
are
cheap
translations
from
the
french
de
amicis
the
most
popular
native
writer
and
one
whose
name
is
familiar
to
every
one
as
a
traveler
in
gautier
footsteps
has
written
but
few
stories
of
which
the
best
however
manuel
menendez
is
the
incarnation
of
the
soul
of
tragedy
less
recently
stendhal
balzac
and
flaubert
have
harped
the
same
note
of
accentuated
despair
musset
has
sung
songs
that
would
make
a
statue
weep
and
baudelaire
seems
to
have
supped
sorrow
with
a
long
spoon
in
brief
the
testimony
of
all
purely
modern
writers
amounts
pretty
much
to
the
same
thing
life
to
them
seems
an
affliction
this
of
course
it
may
do
without
altering
its
value
to
others
let
any
one
for
instance
go
to
a
and
refined
girl
of
eighteen
and
tell
her
that
life
is
an
affliction
and
she
will
look
upon
her
informant
as
a
retailer
of
trumpery
paradox
and
at
eighteen
what
a
festival
is
life
to
one
splendid
in
beauty
and
rich
in
hope
how
magnificent
it
all
seems
what
unexplored
yet
inviting
countries
extend
about
the
horizon
winter
is
a
kiss
that
tingles
and
summer
a
warm
caress
everything
even
to
death
holds
its
promise
and
then
picture
her
as
she
will
be
at
eighty
without
an
illusion
left
and
turning
her
tired
eyes
each
way
in
search
of
rest
life
is
not
an
affliction
to
those
who
are
and
who
can
remain
young
there
are
some
who
without
any
waters
of
youth
remain
so
until
age
has
sapped
the
foundation
of
their
being
and
it
is
from
such
as
they
that
the
greatest
cheer
is
obtained
but
to
those
who
live
so
to
speak
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
who
see
hope
after
hope
fall
with
a
crash
and
illusion
after
illusion
vanish
into
still
air
to
the
intelligent
to
the
observer
and
especially
to
him
who
is
forced
against
his
will
to
struggle
in
the
van
life
is
an
affliction
a
mishap
a
calamity
and
sometimes
a
curse
that
there
are
many
such
is
proven
by
the
statistics
which
the
daily
papers
afford
and
could
one
play
asmodeus
and
look
into
the
secret
lives
of
all
men
the
evidence
obtainable
would
in
its
baldness
seem
hideously
undesirable
the
degrees
of
sensitiveness
however
and
the
ability
or
inability
to
support
suffering
vary
admittedly
with
the
individual
there
are
men
who
rise
from
an
insult
refreshed
there
are
many
to
whom
an
injury
is
a
tonic
and
pain
a
stimulant
and
there
is
even
a
greater
number
whose
sensibilities
are
so
dull
that
what
is
torture
to
another
is
barely
a
twinge
to
them
it
was
the
melancholy
privilege
of
the
writer
to
assist
a
short
time
since
at
an
operation
performed
in
a
german
hospital
a
common
soldier
had
been
thrown
from
a
horse
with
such
force
that
his
elbow
was
dislocated
in
the
he
put
his
uninjured
arm
around
a
post
and
then
let
the
surgeon
pull
on
a
strap
which
had
been
fastened
to
the
other
until
the
joint
was
once
more
in
position
his
arm
was
then
bandaged
and
he
was
told
to
return
in
a
fortnight
on
his
second
visit
the
bandage
was
removed
and
the
surgeon
after
a
violent
effort
moved
the
stiffened
joint
backwards
and
forwards
during
both
operations
the
only
noticeable
evidence
of
pain
was
a
slight
contraction
of
the
upper
lip
while
the
general
expression
of
his
face
was
that
of
a
calm
as
stolid
as
is
required
of
the
soldier
when
in
the
presence
of
his
superior
to
such
an
one
as
he
life
is
no
more
an
affliction
than
it
is
to
the
turtle
then
there
are
those
to
whom
life
is
the
amusing
dream
of
an
hour
who
flit
through
existence
in
loops
of
yellow
light
who
find
pleasure
in
all
things
and
are
careless
of
the
morrow
and
these
perhaps
above
all
others
are
the
most
to
be
envied
it
is
such
natures
as
theirs
that
are
usually
met
with
in
ordinary
fiction
and
which
are
so
singularly
infrequent
in
real
life
in
fancy
they
are
evoked
with
ease
and
yet
somehow
they
do
not
seem
to
bear
the
stamp
which
experience
has
set
upon
the
real
that
there
are
such
natures
it
is
of
course
absurd
to
deny
but
to
affirm
that
they
are
persistent
types
is
scarcely
in
accordance
with
facts
there
are
for
instance
many
young
people
who
enter
life
with
a
prodigality
of
supposition
which
is
certainly
lavish
they
see
that
others
are
smiling
and
that
life
even
to
its
outskirts
presents
an
appearance
of
pleasing
serenity
the
supposition
which
they
foster
that
a
percentage
of
happiness
will
be
allotted
to
them
is
then
not
unreasonable
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
natural
but
as
far
as
the
expectation
goes
we
are
most
of
us
very
well
aware
that
it
holds
its
own
but
for
a
short
space
of
time
this
fact
while
is
not
always
satisfactorily
explained
indeed
the
reason
why
so
many
become
disappointed
with
life
is
perhaps
explainable
only
on
psychological
grounds
by
all
means
the
most
important
rôle
throughout
the
entire
length
and
breadth
of
humanity
is
that
which
is
played
by
thought
its
influence
is
as
noticeable
in
a
bakeshop
as
in
the
overthrow
of
an
empire
yet
in
spite
of
the
results
which
are
constantly
springing
from
it
it
was
rousseau
opinion
that
qui
pense
est
un
animal
dépravé
balzac
caught
at
this
theme
and
wrung
from
it
its
most
severe
deductions
to
him
it
was
a
dissolvent
of
greater
or
less
activity
according
to
the
nature
of
the
individual
in
whom
it
worked
others
have
considered
it
to
be
the
corrosive
acid
of
existence
and
the
mainspring
of
every
misfortune
all
this
it
may
or
may
not
be
but
that
at
least
it
is
the
prime
factor
of
disenchantment
is
evidenced
by
such
an
instance
as
that
man
as
a
rule
and
with
but
few
exceptions
pictures
in
advance
the
pleasures
and
sensations
which
the
future
seems
to
hold
and
yet
when
the
pictured
future
becomes
the
actual
present
the
disproportion
between
fact
and
fancy
is
so
great
that
it
results
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
in
a
complete
insolvency
after
one
or
more
bankruptcies
of
this
description
the
individual
very
generally
finds
that
he
has
had
enough
so
to
speak
and
lets
hope
ever
after
alone
whereupon
disillusionment
steps
in
and
takes
its
place
it
is
thought
then
that
does
the
mischief
or
to
be
more
exact
it
is
the
inability
to
maintain
an
equilibrium
between
the
real
and
the
ideal
that
is
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
cause
of
disenchantment
to
this
it
may
be
also
added
that
it
is
because
every
one
is
so
well
organized
for
misfortune
that
such
a
small
amount
of
open
revolt
is
encountered
when
it
does
appear
it
is
as
a
rule
presented
by
such
thinkers
as
have
been
mentioned
in
the
course
of
these
pages
who
through
their
assertion
of
the
undeniable
awake
the
dislike
and
animosity
of
those
who
have
not
yet
had
their
fill
of
proceedings
in
bankruptcy
and
still
hope
to
find
life
a
pleasant
thing
well
worth
the
living
it
may
be
said
in
conclusion
and
without
any
attempt
at
the
discursive
that
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
present
century
is
charged
with
three
distinct
disturbances
the
waning
of
religious
belief
the
insatiable
demand
for
intense
sensations
and
the
increasing
number
of
those
who
live
uncompanied
and
walk
abroad
in
solitude
that
each
of
these
three
effects
is
due
to
one
and
the
cause
is
unquestionable
the
immense
nausea
that
is
spreading
through
all
lands
and
literature
is
at
work
on
the
simple
faith
the
contented
lives
and
joyous
of
earlier
days
and
in
its
results
it
brings
with
it
the
signs
and
portents
of
a
forthcoming
though
undetermined
upheaval
jean
paul
said
that
we
care
for
life
not
because
it
is
beautiful
but
because
we
should
care
for
it
whence
follows
the
oft
repeated
yet
hollow
reasoning
since
we
love
life
it
must
be
beautiful
and
it
is
from
a
series
of
deductions
not
dissimilar
that
the
majority
of
those
who
are
as
yet
unaffected
by
that
which
after
all
may
be
but
a
passing
change
still
cling
resolutely
to
the
possibility
of
earthly
happiness
out
of
a
hundred
intelligent
there
are
seldom
two
who
think
precisely
alike
on
any
given
subject
be
that
subject
what
it
may
art
politics
literature
or
religion
indeed
there
is
but
one
faith
common
to
all
and
that
is
custom
it
is
not
however
customary
to
discuss
a
subject
such
as
that
which
is
treated
in
these
pages
and
it
is
as
a
rule
considered
just
as
bad
form
to
question
the
value
of
life
as
it
is
to
touch
upon
matters
of
an
indelicate
or
repulsive
nature
it
is
perhaps
for
this
latter
reason
as
also
in
view
of
the
great
difference
of
expressed
opinion
on
all
topics
that
in
england
and
especially
in
america
so
little
is
said
on
this
subject
which
for
many
years
past
has
been
of
interest
to
the
rest
of
the
thinking
world
and
which
each
year
is
gaining
in
strength
and
significance
what
its
final
solution
will
be
is
of
course
uncertain
schopenhauer
recommended
absolute
chastity
as
the
means
to
the
great
goal
and
hartmann
has
vaguely
suggested
a
universal
denial
of
the
will
to
live
more
recently
renan
has
hazarded
the
supposition
that
in
the
advance
of
science
some
one
might
discover
a
force
capable
of
blowing
the
planet
to
atoms
and
which
if
successfully
handled
would
of
course
annihilate
pain
but
these
ideas
however
practicable
or
impracticable
they
may
be
in
the
future
are
for
the
moment
merely
theories
the
world
is
not
yet
ripe
for
a
supreme
quietus
and
in
the
mean
time
the
worth
of
life
may
still
be
questioned
the
question
then
as
to
whether
life
is
valuable
valueless
or
an
affliction
can
with
regard
to
the
individual
be
answered
only
after
a
consideration
of
the
different
circumstances
attendant
on
each
particular
case
but
broadly
speaking
and
disregarding
its
necessary
exceptions
life
may
be
said
to
be
always
valuable
to
the
obtuse
often
valueless
to
the
sensitive
while
to
him
who
commiserates
with
all
mankind
and
sympathizes
with
everything
that
is
life
never
appears
otherwise
than
as
an
immense
and
terrible
affliction
