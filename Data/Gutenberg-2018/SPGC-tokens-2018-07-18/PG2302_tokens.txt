my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
how
happy
i
was
last
night
how
immeasurably
how
impossibly
happy
that
was
because
for
once
in
your
life
you
had
relented
so
far
as
to
obey
my
wishes
at
about
eight
o
clock
i
awoke
from
sleep
you
know
my
beloved
one
that
i
always
like
to
sleep
for
a
short
hour
after
my
work
is
done
i
awoke
i
say
and
lighting
a
candle
prepared
my
paper
to
write
and
trimmed
my
pen
then
suddenly
for
some
reason
or
another
i
raised
my
eyes
and
felt
my
very
heart
leap
within
me
for
you
had
understood
what
i
wanted
you
had
understood
what
my
heart
was
craving
for
yes
i
perceived
that
a
corner
of
the
curtain
in
your
window
had
been
looped
up
and
fastened
to
the
cornice
as
i
had
suggested
should
be
done
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
dear
face
was
glimmering
at
the
window
and
that
you
were
looking
at
me
from
out
of
the
darkness
of
your
room
and
that
you
were
thinking
of
me
yet
how
vexed
i
felt
that
i
could
not
distinguish
your
sweet
face
clearly
for
there
was
a
time
when
you
and
i
could
see
one
another
without
any
difficulty
at
all
ah
me
but
old
age
is
not
always
a
blessing
my
beloved
one
at
this
very
moment
everything
is
standing
awry
to
my
eyes
for
a
man
needs
only
to
work
late
overnight
in
his
writing
of
something
or
other
for
in
the
morning
his
eyes
to
be
red
and
the
tears
to
be
gushing
from
them
in
a
way
that
makes
him
ashamed
to
be
seen
before
strangers
however
i
was
able
to
picture
to
myself
your
beaming
smile
my
angel
your
kind
bright
smile
and
in
my
heart
there
lurked
just
such
a
feeling
as
on
the
occasion
when
i
first
kissed
you
my
little
barbara
do
you
remember
that
my
darling
yet
somehow
you
seemed
to
be
threatening
me
with
your
tiny
finger
was
it
so
little
wanton
you
must
write
and
tell
me
about
it
in
your
next
letter
but
what
think
you
of
the
plan
of
the
curtain
barbara
it
is
a
charming
one
is
it
not
no
matter
whether
i
be
at
work
or
about
to
retire
to
rest
or
just
awaking
from
sleep
it
enables
me
to
know
that
you
are
thinking
of
me
and
remembering
me
that
you
are
both
well
and
happy
then
when
you
lower
the
curtain
it
means
that
it
is
time
that
i
makar
alexievitch
should
go
to
bed
and
when
again
you
raise
the
curtain
it
means
that
you
are
saying
to
me
good
morning
and
asking
me
how
i
am
and
whether
i
have
slept
well
as
for
myself
adds
the
curtain
i
am
altogether
in
good
health
and
spirits
glory
be
to
god
yes
my
heart
s
delight
you
see
how
easy
a
plan
it
was
to
devise
and
how
much
writing
it
will
save
us
it
is
a
clever
plan
is
it
not
and
it
was
my
own
invention
too
am
i
not
cunning
in
such
matters
barbara
alexievna
well
next
let
me
tell
you
dearest
that
last
night
i
slept
better
and
more
soundly
than
i
had
ever
hoped
to
do
and
that
i
am
the
more
delighted
at
the
fact
in
that
as
you
know
i
had
just
settled
into
a
new
lodging
a
circumstance
only
too
apt
to
keep
one
from
sleeping
this
morning
too
i
arose
joyous
and
full
of
love
at
cockcrow
how
good
seemed
everything
at
that
hour
my
darling
when
i
opened
my
window
i
could
see
the
sun
shining
and
hear
the
birds
singing
and
smell
the
air
laden
with
scents
of
spring
in
short
all
nature
was
awaking
to
life
again
everything
was
in
consonance
with
my
mood
everything
seemed
fair
and
moreover
i
had
a
fancy
that
i
should
fare
well
today
but
my
whole
thoughts
were
bent
upon
you
surely
thought
i
we
mortals
who
dwell
in
pain
and
sorrow
might
with
reason
envy
the
birds
of
heaven
which
know
not
either
and
my
other
thoughts
were
similar
to
these
in
short
i
gave
myself
up
to
fantastic
comparisons
a
little
book
which
i
have
says
the
same
kind
of
thing
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
instance
it
says
that
one
may
have
many
many
fancies
my
barbara
that
as
soon
as
the
spring
comes
on
one
s
thoughts
become
uniformly
pleasant
and
sportive
and
witty
for
the
reason
that
at
that
season
the
mind
inclines
readily
to
tenderness
and
the
world
takes
on
a
more
roseate
hue
from
that
little
book
of
mine
i
have
culled
the
following
passage
and
written
it
down
for
you
to
see
in
particular
does
the
author
express
a
longing
similar
to
my
own
where
he
writes
why
am
i
not
a
bird
free
to
seek
its
quest
and
he
has
written
much
else
god
bless
him
but
tell
me
my
love
where
did
you
go
for
your
walk
this
morning
even
before
i
had
started
for
the
office
you
had
taken
flight
from
your
room
and
passed
through
the
courtyard
yes
looking
as
as
a
bird
in
spring
what
rapture
it
gave
me
to
see
you
ah
little
barbara
little
barbara
you
must
never
give
way
to
grief
for
tears
are
of
no
avail
nor
sorrow
i
know
this
well
i
know
it
of
my
own
experience
so
do
you
rest
quietly
until
you
have
regained
your
health
a
little
but
how
is
our
good
thedora
what
a
kind
heart
she
has
you
write
that
she
is
now
living
with
you
and
that
you
are
satisfied
with
what
she
does
true
you
say
that
she
is
inclined
to
grumble
but
do
not
mind
that
barbara
god
bless
her
for
she
is
an
excellent
soul
but
what
sort
of
an
abode
have
i
lighted
upon
barbara
alexievna
what
sort
of
a
tenement
do
you
think
is
this
formerly
as
you
know
i
used
to
live
in
absolute
stillness
so
much
so
that
if
a
fly
took
wing
it
could
plainly
be
heard
buzzing
here
however
all
is
turmoil
and
shouting
and
clatter
the
plan
of
the
tenement
you
know
already
imagine
a
long
corridor
quite
dark
and
by
no
means
clean
to
the
right
a
dead
wall
and
to
the
left
a
row
of
doors
stretching
as
far
as
the
line
of
rooms
extends
these
rooms
are
tenanted
by
different
people
by
one
by
two
or
by
three
lodgers
as
the
case
may
be
but
in
this
arrangement
there
is
no
sort
of
system
and
the
place
is
a
perfect
noah
s
ark
most
of
the
lodgers
are
respectable
educated
and
even
bookish
people
in
particular
they
include
a
tchinovnik
one
of
the
literary
staff
in
some
government
department
who
is
so
that
he
can
expound
homer
or
any
other
author
in
fact
anything
such
a
man
of
talent
is
he
also
there
are
a
couple
of
officers
for
ever
playing
cards
a
midshipman
and
an
english
tutor
but
to
amuse
you
dearest
let
me
describe
these
people
more
categorically
in
my
next
letter
and
tell
you
in
detail
about
their
lives
as
for
our
landlady
she
is
a
dirty
little
old
woman
who
always
walks
about
in
a
and
slippers
and
never
ceases
to
shout
at
theresa
i
myself
live
in
the
kitchen
or
rather
in
a
small
room
which
forms
part
of
the
kitchen
the
latter
is
a
very
large
bright
clean
cheerful
apartment
with
three
windows
in
it
and
a
which
running
outwards
from
the
front
wall
makes
a
sort
of
little
den
a
sort
of
extra
room
for
myself
everything
in
this
den
is
comfortable
and
convenient
and
i
have
as
i
say
a
window
to
myself
so
much
for
a
description
of
my
do
not
think
dearest
that
in
all
this
there
is
any
hidden
intention
the
fact
that
i
live
in
the
kitchen
merely
means
that
i
live
behind
the
partition
wall
in
that
apartment
that
i
live
quite
alone
and
spend
my
time
in
a
quiet
fashion
compounded
of
trifles
for
furniture
i
have
provided
myself
with
a
bed
a
table
a
chest
of
drawers
and
two
small
chairs
also
i
have
suspended
an
ikon
true
better
rooms
may
exist
in
the
world
than
this
much
better
rooms
yet
comfort
is
the
chief
thing
in
fact
i
have
made
all
my
arrangements
for
comfort
s
sake
alone
so
do
not
for
a
moment
imagine
that
i
had
any
other
end
in
view
and
since
your
window
happens
to
be
just
opposite
to
mine
and
since
the
courtyard
between
us
is
narrow
and
i
can
see
you
as
you
pass
why
the
result
is
that
this
miserable
wretch
will
be
able
to
live
at
once
more
happily
and
with
less
outlay
the
dearest
room
in
this
house
costs
with
board
roubles
more
than
my
purse
could
well
afford
whereas
my
room
costs
only
though
formerly
i
used
to
pay
thirty
and
so
had
to
deny
myself
many
things
i
could
drink
tea
but
seldom
and
never
could
indulge
in
tea
and
sugar
as
i
do
now
but
somehow
i
do
not
like
having
to
go
without
tea
for
everyone
else
here
is
respectable
and
the
fact
makes
me
ashamed
after
all
one
drinks
tea
largely
to
please
one
s
fellow
men
barbara
and
to
give
oneself
tone
and
an
air
of
gentility
though
of
myself
i
care
little
about
such
things
for
i
am
not
a
man
of
the
finicking
sort
yet
think
you
that
when
all
things
needful
boots
and
the
rest
have
been
paid
for
much
will
remain
yet
i
ought
not
to
grumble
at
my
salary
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
it
it
is
sufficient
it
has
sufficed
me
now
for
some
years
and
in
addition
i
receive
certain
gratuities
well
my
darling
i
have
bought
you
two
little
pots
of
geraniums
quite
cheap
little
pots
too
as
a
present
perhaps
you
would
also
like
some
mignonette
mignonette
it
shall
be
if
only
you
will
write
to
inform
me
of
everything
in
detail
also
do
not
misunderstand
the
fact
that
i
have
taken
this
room
my
dearest
convenience
and
nothing
else
has
made
me
do
so
the
snugness
of
the
place
has
caught
my
fancy
also
i
shall
be
able
to
save
money
here
and
to
hoard
it
against
the
future
already
i
have
saved
a
little
money
as
a
beginning
nor
must
you
despise
me
because
i
am
such
an
insignificant
old
fellow
that
a
fly
could
break
me
with
its
wing
true
i
am
not
a
swashbuckler
but
perhaps
there
may
also
abide
in
me
the
spirit
which
should
pertain
to
every
man
who
is
at
once
resigned
and
sure
of
himself
then
again
my
angel
i
have
now
covered
close
upon
a
whole
two
sheets
of
notepaper
though
i
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
starting
for
the
office
i
kiss
your
hands
and
remain
ever
your
devoted
slave
your
faithful
friend
makar
dievushkin
one
thing
i
beg
of
you
above
all
things
and
that
is
that
you
will
answer
this
letter
as
fully
as
possible
with
the
letter
i
send
you
a
packet
of
bonbons
eat
them
for
your
health
s
sake
nor
for
the
love
of
god
feel
any
uneasiness
about
me
once
more
dearest
one
april
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
do
you
know
must
quarrel
with
you
yes
good
makar
alexievitch
i
really
can
not
accept
your
presents
for
i
know
what
they
must
have
cost
you
i
know
to
what
privations
and
they
must
have
led
how
many
times
have
i
not
told
you
that
i
stand
in
need
of
nothing
of
absolutely
nothing
as
well
as
that
i
shall
never
be
in
a
position
to
recompense
you
for
all
the
kindly
acts
with
which
you
have
loaded
me
why
for
instance
have
you
sent
me
geraniums
a
little
sprig
of
balsam
would
not
have
mattered
so
much
but
geraniums
only
have
i
to
let
fall
an
unguarded
word
for
example
about
geraniums
and
at
once
you
buy
me
some
how
much
they
must
have
cost
you
yet
what
a
charm
there
is
in
them
with
their
flaming
petals
wherever
did
you
get
these
beautiful
plants
i
have
set
them
in
my
window
as
the
most
conspicuous
place
possible
while
on
the
floor
i
have
placed
a
bench
for
my
other
flowers
to
stand
on
since
you
are
good
enough
to
enrich
me
with
such
presents
unfortunately
thedora
who
with
her
sweeping
and
polishing
makes
a
perfect
sanctuary
of
my
room
is
not
at
the
arrangement
but
why
have
you
sent
me
also
bonbons
your
letter
tells
me
that
something
special
is
afoot
with
you
for
i
find
in
it
so
much
about
paradise
and
spring
and
sweet
odours
and
the
songs
of
birds
surely
thought
i
to
myself
when
i
received
it
this
is
as
good
as
poetry
indeed
verses
are
the
only
thing
that
your
letter
lacks
makar
alexievitch
and
what
tender
feelings
i
can
read
in
it
what
fancies
to
the
curtain
however
i
had
never
given
a
thought
the
fact
is
that
when
i
moved
the
it
looped
itself
up
there
now
ah
makar
alexievitch
you
neither
speak
of
nor
give
any
account
of
what
you
have
spent
upon
me
you
hope
thereby
to
deceive
me
to
make
it
seem
as
though
the
cost
always
falls
upon
you
alone
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
conceal
yet
i
know
that
for
my
sake
you
deny
yourself
necessaries
for
instance
what
has
made
you
go
and
take
the
room
which
you
have
done
where
you
will
be
worried
and
disturbed
and
where
you
have
neither
nor
comfort
you
who
love
solitude
and
never
like
to
have
any
one
near
you
to
judge
from
your
salary
i
should
think
that
you
might
well
live
in
greater
ease
than
that
also
thedora
tells
me
that
your
circumstances
used
to
be
much
more
affluent
than
they
are
at
present
do
you
wish
then
to
persuade
me
that
your
whole
existence
has
been
passed
in
loneliness
and
want
and
gloom
with
never
a
cheering
word
to
help
you
nor
a
seat
in
a
friend
s
ah
kind
comrade
how
my
heart
aches
for
you
but
do
not
overtask
your
health
makar
alexievitch
for
instance
you
say
that
your
eyes
are
for
you
to
go
on
writing
in
your
office
by
then
why
do
so
i
am
sure
that
your
official
superiors
do
not
need
to
be
convinced
of
your
diligence
once
more
i
implore
you
not
to
waste
so
much
money
upon
me
i
know
how
much
you
love
me
but
i
also
know
that
you
are
not
rich
this
morning
i
too
rose
in
good
spirits
thedora
had
long
been
at
work
and
it
was
time
that
i
too
should
bestir
myself
indeed
i
was
yearning
to
do
so
so
i
went
out
for
some
silk
and
then
sat
down
to
my
labours
all
the
morning
i
felt
and
cheerful
yet
now
my
thoughts
are
once
more
dark
and
sad
once
more
my
heart
is
ready
to
sink
ah
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
what
will
be
my
fate
to
have
to
be
so
uncertain
as
to
the
future
to
have
to
be
unable
to
foretell
what
is
going
to
happen
distresses
me
deeply
even
to
look
back
at
the
past
is
horrible
for
it
contains
sorrow
that
breaks
my
very
heart
at
the
thought
of
it
yes
a
whole
century
in
tears
could
i
spend
because
of
the
wicked
people
who
have
wrecked
my
life
but
dusk
is
coming
on
and
i
must
set
to
work
again
much
else
should
i
have
liked
to
write
to
you
but
time
is
lacking
and
i
must
hasten
of
course
to
write
this
letter
is
a
pleasure
enough
and
could
never
be
wearisome
but
why
do
you
not
come
to
see
me
in
person
why
do
you
not
makar
alexievitch
you
live
so
close
to
me
and
at
least
some
of
your
time
is
your
own
i
pray
you
come
i
have
just
seen
theresa
she
was
looking
so
ill
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
gave
her
twenty
kopecks
i
am
almost
falling
asleep
write
to
me
in
fullest
detail
both
concerning
your
mode
of
life
and
concerning
the
people
who
live
with
you
and
concerning
how
you
fare
with
them
i
should
so
like
to
know
yes
you
must
write
again
tonight
i
have
purposely
looped
the
curtain
up
go
to
bed
early
for
last
night
i
saw
your
candle
burning
until
nearly
midnight
goodbye
i
am
now
feeling
sad
and
weary
ah
that
i
should
have
to
spend
such
days
as
this
one
has
been
again
your
friend
barbara
dobroselova
april
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
to
think
that
a
day
like
this
should
have
fallen
to
my
miserable
lot
surely
you
are
making
fun
of
an
old
man
however
it
was
my
own
fault
my
own
fault
entirely
one
ought
not
to
grow
old
holding
a
lock
of
cupid
s
hair
in
one
s
hand
naturally
one
is
misunderstood
yet
man
is
sometimes
a
very
strange
being
by
all
the
saints
he
will
talk
of
doing
things
yet
leave
them
undone
and
remain
looking
the
kind
of
fool
from
whom
may
the
lord
preserve
us
nay
i
am
not
angry
my
beloved
i
am
only
vexed
to
think
that
i
should
have
written
to
you
in
such
stupid
flowery
phraseology
today
i
went
hopping
and
skipping
to
the
office
for
my
heart
was
under
your
influence
and
my
soul
was
keeping
holiday
as
it
were
yes
everything
seemed
to
be
going
well
with
me
then
i
betook
myself
to
my
work
but
with
what
result
i
gazed
around
at
the
old
familiar
objects
at
the
old
familiar
grey
and
gloomy
objects
they
looked
just
the
same
as
before
yet
were
those
the
same
inkstains
the
same
tables
and
chairs
that
i
had
hitherto
known
yes
they
were
the
same
exactly
the
same
so
why
should
i
have
gone
off
riding
on
pegasus
back
whence
had
that
mood
arisen
it
had
arisen
from
the
fact
that
a
certain
sun
had
beamed
upon
me
and
turned
the
sky
to
blue
but
why
so
why
is
it
sometimes
that
sweet
odours
seem
to
be
blowing
through
a
courtyard
where
nothing
of
the
sort
can
be
they
must
be
born
of
my
foolish
fancy
for
a
man
may
stray
so
far
into
sentiment
as
to
forget
his
immediate
surroundings
and
to
give
way
to
the
superfluity
of
fond
ardour
with
which
his
heart
is
charged
on
the
other
hand
as
i
walked
home
from
the
office
at
nightfall
my
feet
seemed
to
lag
and
my
head
to
be
aching
also
a
cold
wind
seemed
to
be
blowing
down
my
back
enraptured
with
the
spring
i
had
gone
out
clad
only
in
a
thin
overcoat
yet
you
have
misunderstood
my
sentiments
dearest
they
are
altogether
different
to
what
you
suppose
it
is
a
purely
paternal
feeling
that
i
have
for
you
i
stand
towards
you
in
the
position
of
a
relative
who
is
bound
to
watch
over
your
lonely
orphanhood
this
i
say
in
all
sincerity
and
with
a
single
purpose
as
any
kinsman
might
do
for
after
all
i
am
a
distant
kinsman
of
yours
the
seventh
drop
of
water
in
the
pudding
as
the
proverb
has
it
yet
still
a
kinsman
and
at
the
present
time
your
nearest
relative
and
protector
seeing
that
where
you
had
the
right
to
look
for
help
and
protection
you
found
only
treachery
and
insult
as
for
poetry
i
may
say
that
i
consider
it
unbecoming
for
a
man
of
my
years
to
devote
his
faculties
to
the
making
of
verses
poetry
is
rubbish
even
boys
at
school
ought
to
be
whipped
for
writing
it
why
do
you
write
thus
about
comfort
and
peace
and
the
rest
i
am
not
a
fastidious
man
nor
one
who
requires
much
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
so
comfortable
as
now
why
then
should
i
complain
in
my
old
age
i
have
enough
to
eat
i
am
well
dressed
and
booted
also
i
have
my
diversions
you
see
i
am
not
of
noble
blood
my
father
himself
was
not
a
gentleman
he
and
his
family
had
to
live
even
more
plainly
than
i
do
nor
am
i
a
milksop
nevertheless
to
speak
frankly
i
do
not
like
my
present
abode
so
much
as
i
used
to
like
my
old
one
somehow
the
latter
seemed
more
cosy
dearest
of
course
this
room
is
a
good
one
enough
in
fact
in
some
respects
it
is
the
more
cheerful
and
interesting
of
the
two
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
no
yet
i
miss
the
room
that
used
to
be
so
familiar
to
me
old
lodgers
like
myself
soon
grow
as
attached
to
our
chattels
as
to
a
kinsman
my
old
room
was
such
a
snug
little
place
true
its
walls
resembled
those
of
any
other
room
i
am
not
speaking
of
that
the
point
is
that
the
recollection
of
them
seems
to
haunt
my
mind
with
sadness
curious
that
recollections
should
be
so
mournful
even
what
in
that
room
used
to
vex
me
and
inconvenience
me
now
looms
in
a
purified
light
and
figures
in
my
imagination
as
a
thing
to
be
desired
we
used
to
live
there
so
quietly
i
and
an
old
landlady
who
is
now
dead
how
my
heart
aches
to
remember
her
for
she
was
a
good
woman
and
never
overcharged
for
her
rooms
her
whole
time
was
spent
in
making
patchwork
quilts
with
that
were
an
arshin
an
ell
long
oftentimes
we
shared
the
same
candle
and
board
also
she
had
a
granddaughter
masha
a
girl
who
was
then
a
mere
baby
but
must
now
be
a
girl
of
thirteen
this
little
piece
of
mischief
how
she
used
to
make
us
laugh
the
day
long
we
lived
together
a
happy
family
of
three
often
of
a
long
winter
s
evening
we
would
first
have
tea
at
the
big
round
table
and
then
betake
ourselves
to
our
work
the
while
that
to
amuse
the
child
and
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
the
old
lady
would
set
herself
to
tell
stories
what
stories
they
were
though
stories
less
suitable
for
a
child
than
for
a
educated
person
my
word
why
i
myself
have
sat
listening
to
them
as
i
smoked
my
pipe
until
i
have
forgotten
about
work
altogether
and
then
as
the
story
grew
grimmer
the
little
child
our
little
bag
of
mischief
would
grow
thoughtful
in
proportion
and
clasp
her
rosy
cheeks
in
her
tiny
hands
and
hiding
her
face
press
closer
to
the
old
landlady
ah
how
i
loved
to
see
her
at
those
moments
as
one
gazed
at
her
one
would
fail
to
notice
how
the
candle
was
flickering
or
how
the
storm
was
swishing
the
snow
about
the
courtyard
yes
that
was
a
goodly
life
my
barbara
and
we
lived
it
for
nearly
twenty
years
how
my
tongue
does
carry
me
away
maybe
the
subject
does
not
interest
you
and
i
myself
find
it
a
not
subject
to
recall
especially
at
the
present
time
darkness
is
falling
and
theresa
is
busying
herself
with
something
or
another
my
head
and
my
back
are
aching
and
even
my
thoughts
seem
to
be
in
pain
so
strangely
do
they
occur
yes
my
heart
is
sad
today
barbara
what
is
it
you
have
written
to
me
why
do
you
not
come
in
person
to
see
me
dear
one
what
would
people
say
i
should
have
but
to
cross
the
courtyard
for
people
to
begin
noticing
us
and
asking
themselves
questions
gossip
and
scandal
would
arise
and
there
would
be
read
into
the
affair
quite
another
meaning
than
the
real
one
no
little
angel
it
were
better
that
i
should
see
you
tomorrow
at
vespers
that
will
be
the
better
plan
and
less
hurtful
to
us
both
nor
must
you
chide
me
beloved
because
i
have
written
you
a
letter
like
this
reading
it
through
i
see
it
to
be
all
odds
and
ends
for
i
am
an
old
man
now
dear
barbara
and
an
uneducated
one
little
learning
had
i
in
my
youth
and
things
refuse
to
fix
themselves
in
my
brain
when
i
try
to
learn
them
anew
no
i
am
not
skilled
in
barbara
and
without
being
told
so
or
any
one
laughing
at
me
for
it
i
know
that
whenever
i
try
to
describe
anything
with
more
than
ordinary
distinctness
i
fall
into
the
mistake
of
talking
sheer
rubbish
i
saw
you
at
your
window
today
yes
i
saw
you
as
you
were
drawing
down
the
blind
goodbye
little
barbara
and
may
god
keep
you
my
own
barbara
alexievna
your
sincere
friend
makar
dievushkin
do
not
think
that
i
could
write
to
you
in
a
satirical
vein
for
i
am
too
old
to
show
my
teeth
to
no
purpose
and
people
would
laugh
at
me
and
quote
our
russian
proverb
who
diggeth
a
pit
for
another
one
the
same
shall
fall
into
it
april
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
are
not
you
my
friend
and
benefactor
just
a
little
ashamed
to
repine
and
give
way
to
such
despondency
and
surely
you
are
not
offended
with
me
ah
though
often
thoughtless
in
my
speech
i
never
should
have
imagined
that
you
would
take
my
words
as
a
jest
at
your
expense
rest
assured
that
never
should
i
make
sport
of
your
years
or
of
your
character
only
my
own
levity
is
at
fault
still
more
the
fact
that
i
am
so
weary
of
life
what
will
such
a
feeling
not
engender
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
supposed
that
you
were
jesting
in
your
letter
wherefore
my
heart
was
feeling
heavy
at
the
thought
that
you
could
feel
so
displeased
with
me
kind
comrade
and
helper
you
will
be
doing
me
an
injustice
if
for
a
single
moment
you
ever
suspect
that
i
am
lacking
in
feeling
or
in
gratitude
towards
you
my
heart
believe
me
is
able
to
appraise
at
its
true
worth
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
by
protecting
me
from
my
enemies
and
from
hatred
and
persecution
never
shall
i
cease
to
pray
to
god
for
you
and
should
my
prayers
ever
reach
him
and
be
received
of
heaven
then
assuredly
fortune
will
smile
upon
you
today
i
am
not
well
by
turns
i
shiver
and
flush
with
heat
and
thedora
is
greatly
disturbed
about
me
do
not
scruple
to
come
and
see
me
makar
alexievitch
how
can
it
concern
other
people
what
you
do
you
and
i
are
well
enough
acquainted
with
each
other
and
one
s
own
affairs
are
one
s
own
affairs
goodbye
makar
alexievitch
for
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
all
i
had
to
say
and
am
feeling
too
unwell
to
write
more
again
i
beg
of
you
not
to
be
angry
with
me
but
to
rest
assured
of
my
constant
respect
and
your
humble
devoted
servant
barbara
dobroselova
april
dearest
mistress
barbara
alexievna
i
pray
you
my
beloved
to
tell
me
what
ails
you
every
one
of
your
letters
fills
me
with
alarm
on
the
other
hand
in
every
letter
i
urge
you
to
be
more
careful
of
yourself
and
to
wrap
up
yourself
warmly
and
to
avoid
going
out
in
bad
weather
and
to
be
in
all
things
prudent
yet
you
go
and
disobey
me
ah
little
angel
you
are
a
perfect
child
i
know
well
that
you
are
as
weak
as
a
blade
of
grass
and
that
no
matter
what
wind
blows
upon
you
you
are
ready
to
fade
but
you
must
be
careful
of
yourself
dearest
you
must
look
after
yourself
better
you
must
avoid
all
risks
lest
you
plunge
your
friends
into
desolation
and
despair
dearest
you
also
express
a
wish
to
learn
the
details
of
my
daily
life
and
surroundings
that
wish
i
hasten
to
satisfy
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
since
by
doing
so
i
shall
explain
things
more
systematically
in
the
first
place
on
entering
this
house
one
passes
into
a
very
bare
hall
and
thence
along
a
passage
to
a
mean
staircase
the
reception
room
however
is
bright
clean
and
spacious
and
is
lined
with
redwood
and
but
the
scullery
you
would
not
care
to
see
it
is
greasy
dirty
and
odoriferous
while
the
stairs
are
in
rags
and
the
walls
so
covered
with
filth
that
the
hand
sticks
fast
wherever
it
touches
them
also
on
each
landing
there
is
a
medley
of
boxes
chairs
and
dilapidated
wardrobes
while
the
windows
have
had
most
of
their
panes
shattered
and
everywhere
stand
washtubs
filled
with
dirt
litter
eggshells
and
the
smell
is
abominable
in
short
the
house
is
not
a
nice
one
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
rooms
i
have
described
it
to
you
already
true
they
are
convenient
enough
yet
every
one
of
them
has
an
atmosphere
i
do
not
mean
that
they
smell
badly
so
much
as
that
each
of
them
seems
to
contain
something
which
gives
forth
a
rank
odour
at
first
the
impression
is
an
unpleasant
one
but
a
couple
of
minutes
will
suffice
to
dissipate
it
for
the
reason
that
everything
here
smells
people
s
clothes
hands
and
everything
else
and
one
grows
accustomed
to
the
rankness
canaries
however
soon
die
in
this
house
a
naval
officer
here
has
just
bought
his
fifth
birds
can
not
live
long
in
such
an
air
every
morning
when
fish
or
beef
is
being
cooked
and
washing
and
scrubbing
are
in
progress
the
house
is
filled
with
steam
always
too
the
kitchen
is
full
of
linen
hanging
out
to
dry
and
since
my
room
adjoins
that
apartment
the
smell
from
the
clothes
causes
me
not
a
little
annoyance
however
one
can
grow
used
to
anything
from
earliest
dawn
the
house
is
astir
as
its
inmates
rise
walk
about
and
stamp
their
feet
that
is
to
say
everyone
who
has
to
go
to
work
then
gets
out
of
bed
first
of
all
tea
is
partaken
of
most
of
the
belong
to
the
landlady
and
since
there
are
not
very
many
of
them
we
have
to
wait
our
turn
anyone
who
fails
to
do
so
will
find
his
teapot
emptied
and
put
away
on
the
first
occasion
that
was
what
happened
to
myself
well
is
there
anything
else
to
tell
you
already
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
company
here
the
naval
officer
took
the
initiative
in
calling
upon
me
and
his
frankness
was
such
that
he
told
me
all
about
his
father
his
mother
his
sister
who
is
married
to
a
lawyer
of
tula
and
the
town
of
kronstadt
also
he
promised
me
his
patronage
and
asked
me
to
come
and
take
tea
with
him
i
kept
the
appointment
in
a
room
where
is
continually
in
progress
and
after
tea
had
been
drunk
efforts
were
made
to
induce
me
to
gamble
whether
or
not
my
refusal
seemed
to
the
company
ridiculous
i
can
not
say
but
at
all
events
my
companions
played
the
whole
evening
and
were
playing
when
i
left
the
dust
and
smoke
in
the
room
made
my
eyes
ache
i
declined
as
i
say
to
play
cards
and
was
therefore
requested
to
discourse
on
philosophy
after
which
no
one
spoke
to
me
at
all
a
result
which
i
did
not
regret
in
fact
i
have
no
intention
of
going
there
again
since
every
one
is
for
gambling
and
for
nothing
but
gambling
even
the
literary
tchinovnik
gives
such
parties
in
his
room
though
in
his
case
everything
is
done
delicately
and
with
a
certain
refinement
so
that
the
thing
has
something
of
a
retiring
and
innocent
air
in
passing
i
may
tell
you
that
our
landlady
is
not
a
nice
woman
in
fact
she
is
a
regular
beldame
you
have
seen
her
once
so
what
do
you
think
of
her
she
is
as
lanky
as
a
plucked
chicken
in
consumption
and
with
phaldoni
her
servant
constitutes
the
entire
staff
of
the
establishment
whether
or
not
phaldoni
has
any
other
name
i
do
not
know
but
at
least
he
answers
to
this
one
and
every
one
calls
him
by
it
a
crooked
lout
he
is
for
ever
wrangling
with
theresa
until
the
pair
nearly
come
to
blows
in
short
life
is
not
overly
pleasant
in
this
place
never
at
any
time
is
the
household
wholly
at
rest
for
always
there
are
people
sitting
up
to
play
cards
sometimes
too
certain
things
are
done
of
which
it
would
be
shameful
for
me
to
speak
in
particular
hardened
though
i
am
it
astonishes
me
that
men
with
families
should
care
to
live
in
this
sodom
for
example
there
is
a
family
of
poor
folk
who
have
rented
from
the
landlady
a
room
which
does
not
adjoin
the
other
rooms
but
is
set
apart
in
a
corner
by
itself
yet
what
quiet
people
they
are
not
a
sound
is
to
be
heard
from
them
the
father
he
is
called
gorshkov
is
a
little
tchinovnik
who
seven
years
ago
was
dismissed
from
public
service
and
now
walks
about
in
a
coat
so
dirty
and
ragged
that
it
hurts
one
to
see
it
indeed
it
is
a
worse
coat
even
than
mine
also
he
is
so
thin
and
frail
at
times
i
meet
him
in
the
corridor
that
his
knees
quake
under
him
his
hands
and
head
are
tremulous
with
some
disease
god
only
knows
what
and
he
so
fears
and
distrusts
everybody
that
he
always
walks
alone
reserved
though
i
myself
am
he
is
even
worse
as
for
his
family
it
consists
of
a
wife
and
three
children
the
eldest
of
the
latter
a
boy
is
as
frail
as
his
father
while
the
mother
a
woman
who
formerly
must
have
been
good
looking
and
still
has
a
striking
aspect
in
spite
of
her
pallor
goes
about
in
the
sorriest
of
rags
also
i
have
heard
that
they
are
in
debt
to
our
landlady
as
well
as
that
she
is
not
overly
kind
to
them
moreover
i
have
heard
that
gorshkov
lost
his
post
through
some
unpleasantness
or
other
through
a
legal
suit
or
process
of
which
i
could
not
exactly
tell
you
the
nature
yes
they
certainly
are
poor
oh
my
god
how
poor
at
the
same
time
never
a
sound
comes
from
their
room
it
is
as
though
not
a
soul
were
living
in
it
never
does
one
hear
even
the
children
which
is
an
unusual
thing
seeing
that
children
are
ever
ready
to
sport
and
play
and
if
they
fail
to
do
so
it
is
a
bad
sign
one
evening
when
i
chanced
to
be
passing
the
door
of
their
room
and
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
i
heard
through
the
door
a
sob
and
then
a
whisper
and
then
another
sob
as
though
somebody
within
were
weeping
and
with
such
subdued
bitterness
that
it
tore
my
heart
to
hear
the
sound
in
fact
the
thought
of
these
poor
people
never
left
me
all
night
and
quite
prevented
me
from
sleeping
well
my
little
barbara
my
little
friend
beyond
price
i
have
described
to
you
everything
to
the
best
of
my
ability
all
today
you
have
been
in
my
thoughts
all
today
my
heart
has
been
yearning
for
you
i
happen
to
know
dearest
one
that
you
lack
a
warm
cloak
to
me
too
these
petersburg
springs
with
their
winds
and
their
snow
showers
spell
death
good
heavens
how
the
breezes
bite
one
do
not
be
angry
beloved
that
i
should
write
like
this
style
i
have
not
would
that
i
had
i
write
just
what
wanders
into
my
brain
in
the
hope
that
i
may
cheer
you
up
a
little
of
course
had
i
had
a
good
education
things
might
have
been
different
but
as
things
were
i
could
not
have
one
never
did
i
learn
even
to
do
simple
sums
your
faithful
and
unchangeable
friend
makar
dievushkin
april
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
today
i
met
my
cousin
sasha
to
see
her
going
to
wrack
and
ruin
shocked
me
terribly
moreover
it
has
reached
me
through
a
side
wind
that
she
has
been
making
inquiry
for
me
and
dogging
my
footsteps
under
the
pretext
that
she
wishes
to
pardon
me
to
forget
the
past
and
to
renew
our
acquaintance
well
among
other
things
she
told
me
that
whereas
you
are
not
a
kinsman
of
mine
that
she
is
my
nearest
relative
that
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
enter
into
family
relations
with
us
and
that
it
is
wrong
and
shameful
for
me
to
be
living
upon
your
earnings
and
charity
also
she
said
that
i
must
have
forgotten
all
that
she
did
for
me
though
thereby
she
saved
both
myself
and
my
mother
from
starvation
and
gave
us
food
and
drink
that
for
two
and
a
half
years
we
caused
her
great
loss
and
above
all
things
that
she
excused
us
what
we
owed
her
even
my
poor
mother
she
did
not
spare
would
that
she
my
dead
parent
could
know
how
i
am
being
treated
but
god
knows
all
about
it
also
anna
declared
that
it
was
solely
through
my
own
fault
that
my
fortunes
declined
after
she
had
bettered
them
that
she
is
in
no
way
responsible
for
what
then
happened
and
that
i
have
but
myself
to
blame
for
having
been
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
defend
my
honour
great
god
who
then
has
been
at
fault
according
to
anna
hospodin
bwikov
was
only
right
when
he
declined
to
marry
a
woman
who
but
need
i
say
it
it
is
cruel
to
hear
such
lies
as
hers
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
do
not
know
i
tremble
and
sob
and
weep
indeed
even
to
write
this
letter
has
cost
me
two
hours
at
least
it
might
have
been
thought
that
anna
would
have
confessed
her
share
in
the
past
yet
see
what
she
says
for
the
love
of
god
do
not
be
anxious
about
me
my
friend
my
only
benefactor
thedora
is
over
apt
to
exaggerate
matters
i
am
not
really
ill
i
have
merely
caught
a
little
cold
i
caught
it
last
night
while
i
was
walking
to
bolkovo
to
hear
mass
sung
for
my
mother
ah
mother
my
poor
mother
could
you
but
rise
from
the
grave
and
learn
what
is
being
done
to
your
daughter
may
my
dearest
little
barbara
i
am
sending
you
a
few
grapes
which
are
good
for
a
convalescent
person
and
strongly
recommended
by
doctors
for
the
allayment
of
fever
also
you
were
saying
the
other
day
that
you
would
like
some
roses
wherefore
i
now
send
you
a
bunch
are
you
at
all
able
to
eat
my
darling
for
that
is
the
chief
point
which
ought
to
be
seen
to
let
us
thank
god
that
the
past
and
all
its
unhappiness
are
gone
yes
let
us
give
thanks
to
heaven
for
that
much
as
for
books
i
can
not
get
hold
of
any
except
for
a
book
which
written
in
excellent
style
is
i
believe
to
be
had
here
at
all
events
people
keep
praising
it
very
much
and
i
have
begged
the
loan
of
it
for
myself
should
you
too
like
to
read
it
in
this
respect
indeed
i
feel
nervous
for
the
reason
that
it
is
so
difficult
to
divine
what
your
taste
in
books
may
be
despite
my
knowledge
of
your
character
probably
you
would
like
poetry
the
poetry
of
sentiment
and
of
love
making
well
i
will
send
you
a
book
of
my
own
poems
already
i
have
copied
out
part
of
the
manuscript
everything
with
me
is
going
well
so
pray
do
not
be
anxious
on
my
account
beloved
what
thedora
told
you
about
me
was
sheer
rubbish
tell
her
from
me
that
she
has
not
been
speaking
the
truth
yes
do
not
fail
to
give
this
my
message
it
is
not
the
case
that
i
have
gone
and
sold
a
new
uniform
why
should
i
do
so
seeing
that
i
have
forty
roubles
of
salary
still
to
come
to
me
do
not
be
uneasy
my
darling
thedora
is
a
vindictive
woman
merely
a
vindictive
woman
we
shall
yet
see
better
days
only
do
you
get
well
my
angel
only
do
you
get
well
for
the
love
of
god
lest
you
grieve
an
old
man
also
who
told
you
that
i
was
looking
thin
slanders
again
nothing
but
slanders
i
am
as
healthy
as
could
be
and
have
grown
so
fat
that
i
am
ashamed
to
be
so
sleek
of
paunch
would
that
you
were
equally
healthy
now
goodbye
my
angel
i
kiss
every
one
of
your
tiny
fingers
and
remain
ever
your
constant
friend
makar
dievushkin
but
what
is
this
dearest
one
that
you
have
written
to
me
why
do
you
place
me
upon
such
a
pedestal
moreover
how
could
i
come
and
visit
you
frequently
how
i
repeat
of
course
i
might
avail
myself
of
the
cover
of
night
but
alas
the
season
of
the
year
is
what
it
is
and
includes
no
night
time
to
speak
of
in
fact
although
throughout
your
illness
and
delirium
i
scarcely
left
your
side
for
a
moment
i
can
not
think
how
i
contrived
to
do
the
many
things
that
i
did
later
i
ceased
to
visit
you
at
all
for
the
reason
that
people
were
beginning
to
notice
things
and
to
ask
me
questions
yet
even
so
a
scandal
has
arisen
theresa
i
trust
thoroughly
for
she
is
not
a
talkative
woman
but
consider
how
it
will
be
when
the
truth
comes
out
in
its
entirety
what
then
will
folk
not
say
and
think
nevertheless
be
of
good
cheer
my
beloved
and
regain
your
health
when
you
have
done
so
we
will
contrive
to
arrange
a
rendezvous
out
of
doors
june
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
so
eager
am
i
to
do
something
that
will
please
and
divert
you
in
return
for
your
care
for
your
ceaseless
efforts
on
my
behalf
in
short
for
your
love
for
me
that
i
have
decided
to
beguile
a
leisure
hour
for
you
by
delving
into
my
locker
and
extracting
thence
the
manuscript
which
i
send
you
herewith
i
began
it
during
the
happier
period
of
my
life
and
have
continued
it
at
intervals
since
so
often
have
you
asked
me
about
my
former
existence
about
my
mother
about
pokrovski
about
my
sojourn
with
anna
thedorovna
about
my
more
recent
misfortunes
so
often
have
you
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
read
the
manuscript
in
which
god
knows
why
i
have
recorded
certain
incidents
of
my
life
that
i
feel
no
doubt
but
that
the
sending
of
it
will
give
you
sincere
pleasure
yet
somehow
i
feel
depressed
when
i
read
it
for
i
seem
now
to
have
grown
twice
as
old
as
i
was
when
i
penned
its
concluding
lines
ah
makar
alexievitch
how
weary
i
am
how
this
insomnia
tortures
me
convalescence
is
indeed
a
hard
thing
to
bear
one
up
to
the
age
of
fourteen
when
my
father
died
my
childhood
was
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
it
began
very
far
away
from
here
in
the
depths
of
the
province
of
tula
where
my
father
filled
the
position
of
steward
on
the
vast
estates
of
the
prince
p
our
house
was
situated
in
one
of
the
prince
s
villages
and
we
lived
a
quiet
obscure
but
happy
life
a
gay
little
child
was
i
my
one
idea
being
ceaselessly
to
run
about
the
fields
and
the
woods
and
the
garden
no
one
ever
gave
me
a
thought
for
my
father
was
always
occupied
with
business
affairs
and
my
mother
with
her
housekeeping
nor
did
any
one
ever
give
me
any
lessons
a
circumstance
for
which
i
was
not
sorry
at
earliest
dawn
i
would
hie
me
to
a
pond
or
a
copse
or
to
a
hay
or
a
harvest
field
where
the
sun
could
warm
me
and
i
could
roam
wherever
i
liked
and
scratch
my
hands
with
bushes
and
tear
my
clothes
in
pieces
for
this
i
used
to
get
blamed
afterwards
but
i
did
not
care
had
it
befallen
me
never
to
quit
that
village
had
it
befallen
me
to
remain
for
ever
in
that
spot
i
should
always
have
been
happy
but
fate
ordained
that
i
should
leave
my
birthplace
even
before
my
girlhood
had
come
to
an
end
in
short
i
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
we
removed
to
petersburg
ah
how
it
hurts
me
to
recall
the
mournful
gatherings
before
our
departure
and
to
recall
how
bitterly
i
wept
when
the
time
came
for
us
to
say
farewell
to
all
that
i
had
held
so
dear
i
remember
throwing
myself
upon
my
father
s
neck
and
beseeching
him
with
tears
to
stay
in
the
country
a
little
longer
but
he
bid
me
be
silent
and
my
mother
adding
her
tears
to
mine
explained
that
business
matters
compelled
us
to
go
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
prince
p
had
just
died
and
his
heirs
had
dismissed
my
father
from
his
post
whereupon
since
he
had
a
little
money
privately
invested
in
petersburg
he
bethought
him
that
his
personal
presence
in
the
capital
was
necessary
for
the
due
management
of
his
affairs
it
was
my
mother
who
told
me
this
consequently
we
settled
here
in
petersburg
and
did
not
again
move
until
my
father
died
how
difficult
i
found
it
to
grow
accustomed
to
my
new
life
at
the
time
of
our
removal
to
petersburg
it
was
autumn
a
season
when
in
the
country
the
weather
is
clear
and
keen
and
bright
all
agricultural
labour
has
come
to
an
end
the
great
sheaves
of
corn
are
safely
garnered
in
the
byre
and
the
birds
are
flying
hither
and
thither
in
clamorous
flocks
yes
at
that
season
the
country
is
joyous
and
fair
but
here
in
petersburg
at
the
time
when
we
reached
the
city
we
encountered
nothing
but
rain
bitter
autumn
frosts
dull
skies
ugliness
and
crowds
of
strangers
who
looked
hostile
discontented
and
disposed
to
take
offence
however
we
managed
to
settle
down
though
i
remember
that
in
our
new
home
there
was
much
noise
and
confusion
as
we
set
the
establishment
in
order
after
this
my
father
was
seldom
at
home
and
my
mother
had
few
spare
moments
wherefore
i
found
myself
forgotten
the
first
morning
after
our
arrival
when
i
awoke
from
sleep
how
sad
i
felt
i
could
see
that
our
windows
looked
out
upon
a
drab
space
of
wall
and
that
the
street
below
was
littered
with
filth
were
few
and
as
they
walked
they
kept
muffling
themselves
up
against
the
cold
then
there
ensued
days
when
dullness
and
depression
reigned
supreme
scarcely
a
relative
or
an
acquaintance
did
we
possess
in
petersburg
and
even
anna
thedorovna
and
my
father
had
come
to
loggerheads
with
one
another
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
owed
her
money
in
fact
our
only
visitors
were
business
callers
and
as
a
rule
these
came
but
to
wrangle
to
argue
and
to
raise
a
disturbance
such
visits
would
make
my
father
look
very
discontented
and
seem
out
of
temper
for
hours
and
hours
he
would
pace
the
room
with
a
frown
on
his
face
and
a
brooding
silence
on
his
lips
even
my
mother
did
not
dare
address
him
at
these
times
while
for
my
own
part
i
used
to
sit
reading
quietly
and
humbly
in
a
corner
not
venturing
to
make
a
movement
of
any
sort
three
months
after
our
arrival
in
petersburg
i
was
sent
to
a
here
i
found
myself
thrown
among
strange
people
here
everything
was
grim
and
uninviting
with
teachers
continually
shouting
at
me
and
my
for
ever
holding
me
up
to
derision
and
myself
constantly
feeling
awkward
and
uncouth
how
strict
how
exacting
was
the
system
appointed
hours
for
everything
a
common
table
teachers
these
things
simply
worried
and
tortured
me
never
from
the
first
could
i
sleep
but
used
to
weep
many
a
chill
weary
night
away
in
the
evenings
everyone
would
have
to
repeat
or
to
learn
her
lessons
as
i
crouched
over
a
dialogue
or
a
vocabulary
without
daring
even
to
stir
how
my
thoughts
would
turn
to
the
at
home
to
my
father
to
my
mother
to
my
old
nurse
to
the
tales
which
the
latter
had
been
used
to
tell
how
sad
it
all
was
the
memory
of
the
merest
trifle
at
home
would
please
me
and
i
would
think
and
think
how
nice
things
used
to
be
at
home
once
more
i
would
be
sitting
in
our
little
parlour
at
tea
with
my
parents
in
the
familiar
little
parlour
where
everything
was
snug
and
warm
how
ardently
how
convulsively
i
would
seem
to
be
embracing
my
mother
thus
i
would
ponder
until
at
length
tears
of
sorrow
would
softly
gush
forth
and
choke
my
bosom
and
drive
the
lessons
out
of
my
head
for
i
never
could
master
the
tasks
of
the
morrow
no
matter
how
much
my
mistress
and
might
gird
at
me
no
matter
how
much
i
might
repeat
my
lessons
over
and
over
to
myself
knowledge
never
came
with
the
morning
consequently
i
used
to
be
ordered
the
kneeling
punishment
and
given
only
one
meal
in
the
day
how
dull
and
dispirited
i
used
to
feel
from
the
first
my
used
to
tease
and
deride
and
mock
me
whenever
i
was
saying
my
lessons
also
they
used
to
pinch
me
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
dinner
or
tea
and
to
make
groundless
complaints
of
me
to
the
head
mistress
on
the
other
hand
how
heavenly
it
seemed
when
on
saturday
evening
my
old
nurse
arrived
to
fetch
me
how
i
would
embrace
the
old
woman
in
transports
of
joy
after
dressing
me
and
wrapping
me
up
she
would
find
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
pace
with
me
on
the
way
home
so
full
was
i
of
chatter
and
tales
about
one
thing
and
another
then
when
i
had
arrived
home
merry
and
lighthearted
how
fervently
i
would
embrace
my
parents
as
though
i
had
not
seen
them
for
ten
years
such
a
fussing
would
there
be
such
a
talking
and
a
telling
of
tales
to
everyone
i
would
run
with
a
greeting
and
laugh
and
giggle
and
scamper
about
and
skip
for
very
joy
true
my
father
and
i
used
to
have
grave
conversations
about
lessons
and
teachers
and
the
french
language
and
grammar
yet
we
were
all
very
happy
and
contented
together
even
now
it
thrills
me
to
think
of
those
moments
for
my
father
s
sake
i
tried
hard
to
learn
my
lessons
for
i
could
see
that
he
was
spending
his
last
kopeck
upon
me
and
himself
subsisting
god
knows
how
every
day
he
grew
more
morose
and
discontented
and
irritable
every
day
his
character
kept
changing
for
the
worse
he
had
suffered
an
influx
of
debts
nor
were
his
business
affairs
prospering
as
for
my
mother
she
was
afraid
even
to
say
a
word
or
to
weep
aloud
for
fear
of
still
further
angering
him
gradually
she
sickened
grew
thinner
and
thinner
and
became
taken
with
a
painful
cough
whenever
i
reached
home
from
school
i
would
find
every
one
and
my
mother
shedding
silent
tears
and
my
father
raging
bickering
and
high
words
would
arise
during
which
my
father
was
wont
to
declare
that
though
he
no
longer
derived
the
smallest
pleasure
or
relaxation
from
life
and
had
spent
his
last
coin
upon
my
education
i
had
not
yet
mastered
the
french
language
in
short
everything
began
to
go
wrong
to
turn
to
unhappiness
and
for
that
circumstance
my
father
took
vengeance
upon
myself
and
my
mother
how
he
could
treat
my
poor
mother
so
i
can
not
understand
it
used
to
rend
my
heart
to
see
her
so
hollow
were
her
cheeks
becoming
so
sunken
her
eyes
so
hectic
her
face
but
it
was
chiefly
around
myself
that
the
disputes
raged
though
beginning
only
with
some
trifle
they
would
soon
go
on
to
god
knows
what
frequently
even
i
myself
did
not
know
to
what
they
related
anything
and
everything
would
enter
into
them
for
my
father
would
say
that
i
was
an
utter
dunce
at
the
french
language
that
the
head
mistress
of
my
school
was
a
stupid
common
sort
of
women
who
cared
nothing
for
morals
that
he
my
father
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
obtaining
another
post
that
lamonde
s
grammar
was
a
wretched
book
even
a
worse
one
than
zapolski
s
that
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
squandered
upon
me
that
it
was
clear
that
i
was
wasting
my
time
in
repeating
dialogues
and
vocabularies
that
i
alone
was
at
fault
and
that
i
must
answer
for
everything
yet
this
did
not
arise
from
any
want
of
love
for
me
on
the
part
of
my
father
but
rather
from
the
fact
that
he
was
incapable
of
putting
himself
in
my
own
and
my
mother
s
place
it
came
of
a
defect
of
character
all
these
cares
and
worries
and
disappointments
tortured
my
poor
father
until
he
became
moody
and
distrustful
next
he
began
to
neglect
his
health
with
the
result
that
catching
a
chill
he
died
after
a
short
illness
so
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
that
for
a
few
days
we
were
almost
beside
ourselves
with
the
shock
my
mother
in
particular
lying
for
a
while
in
such
a
state
of
torpor
that
i
had
fears
for
her
reason
the
instant
my
father
was
dead
creditors
seemed
to
spring
up
out
of
the
ground
and
to
assail
us
en
masse
everything
that
we
possessed
had
to
be
surrendered
to
them
including
a
little
house
which
my
father
had
bought
six
months
after
our
arrival
in
petersburg
how
matters
were
finally
settled
i
do
not
know
but
we
found
ourselves
roofless
shelterless
and
without
a
copper
my
mother
was
grievously
ill
and
of
means
of
subsistence
we
had
none
before
us
there
loomed
only
ruin
sheer
ruin
at
the
time
i
was
fourteen
years
old
soon
afterwards
anna
thedorovna
came
to
see
us
saying
that
she
was
a
lady
of
property
and
our
relative
and
this
my
mother
confirmed
though
true
she
added
that
anna
was
only
a
very
distant
relative
anna
had
never
taken
the
least
notice
of
us
during
my
father
s
lifetime
yet
now
she
entered
our
presence
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
an
assurance
that
she
meant
to
better
our
fortunes
having
condoled
with
us
on
our
loss
and
destitute
position
she
added
that
my
father
had
been
to
blame
for
everything
in
that
he
had
lived
beyond
his
means
and
taken
upon
himself
more
than
he
was
able
to
perform
also
she
expressed
a
wish
to
draw
closer
to
us
and
to
forget
old
scores
and
when
my
mother
explained
that
for
her
own
part
she
harboured
no
resentment
against
anna
the
latter
burst
into
tears
and
hurrying
my
mother
away
to
church
then
and
there
ordered
mass
to
be
said
for
the
dear
departed
as
she
called
my
father
in
this
manner
she
effected
a
solemn
reconciliation
with
my
mother
next
after
long
negotiations
and
vacillations
coupled
with
much
vivid
description
of
our
destitute
position
our
desolation
and
our
helplessness
anna
invited
us
to
pay
her
as
she
expressed
it
a
return
for
this
my
mother
duly
thanked
her
and
considered
the
invitation
for
a
while
after
which
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
she
informed
anna
thedorovna
that
she
was
prepared
gratefully
to
accept
her
offer
ah
how
i
remember
the
morning
when
we
removed
to
vassilievski
island
a
quarter
of
st
petersburg
it
was
a
clear
dry
frosty
morning
in
autumn
my
mother
could
not
restrain
her
tears
and
i
too
felt
depressed
nay
my
very
heart
seemed
to
be
breaking
under
a
strange
undefined
load
of
sorrow
how
terrible
it
all
seemed
ii
at
first
that
is
to
say
until
my
mother
and
myself
grew
used
to
our
new
abode
we
found
living
at
anna
thedorovna
s
both
strange
and
disagreeable
the
house
was
her
own
and
contained
five
rooms
three
of
which
she
shared
with
my
orphaned
cousin
sasha
whom
she
had
brought
up
from
babyhood
a
fourth
was
occupied
by
my
mother
and
myself
and
the
fifth
was
rented
of
anna
by
a
poor
student
named
pokrovski
although
anna
lived
in
good
style
in
far
better
style
than
might
have
been
expected
her
means
and
her
avocation
were
conjectural
never
was
she
at
rest
never
was
she
not
busy
with
some
mysterious
something
or
other
also
she
possessed
a
wide
and
varied
circle
of
friends
the
stream
of
callers
was
perpetual
although
god
only
knows
who
they
were
or
what
their
business
was
no
sooner
did
my
mother
hear
the
ring
than
off
she
would
carry
me
to
our
own
apartment
this
greatly
displeased
anna
who
used
again
and
again
to
assure
my
mother
that
we
were
too
proud
for
our
station
in
life
in
fact
she
would
sulk
for
hours
about
it
at
the
time
i
could
not
understand
these
reproaches
and
it
was
not
until
long
afterwards
that
i
learned
or
rather
i
guessed
why
eventually
my
mother
declared
that
she
could
not
go
on
living
with
anna
yes
anna
was
a
bad
woman
never
did
she
let
us
alone
as
to
the
exact
motive
why
she
had
asked
us
to
come
and
share
her
house
with
her
i
am
still
in
the
dark
at
first
she
was
not
altogether
unkind
to
us
but
later
she
revealed
to
us
her
real
character
as
soon
that
is
to
say
as
she
saw
that
we
were
at
her
mercy
and
had
nowhere
else
to
go
yes
in
early
days
she
was
quite
kind
to
me
even
offensively
so
but
afterwards
i
had
to
suffer
as
much
as
my
mother
constantly
did
anna
reproach
us
constantly
did
she
remind
us
of
her
benefactions
and
introduce
us
to
her
friends
as
poor
relatives
of
hers
whom
out
of
goodness
of
heart
and
for
the
love
of
christ
she
had
received
into
her
bosom
at
table
also
she
would
watch
every
mouthful
that
we
took
and
if
our
appetite
failed
immediately
she
would
begin
as
before
and
reiterate
that
we
were
that
we
must
not
assume
that
riches
would
mean
happiness
and
that
we
had
better
go
and
live
by
ourselves
moreover
she
never
ceased
to
inveigh
against
my
father
saying
that
he
had
sought
to
be
better
than
other
people
and
thereby
had
brought
himself
to
a
bad
end
that
he
had
left
his
wife
and
daughter
destitute
and
that
but
for
the
fact
that
we
had
happened
to
meet
with
a
kind
and
sympathetic
christian
soul
god
alone
knew
where
we
should
have
laid
our
heads
save
in
the
street
what
did
that
woman
not
say
to
hear
her
was
not
so
much
galling
as
disgusting
from
time
to
time
my
mother
would
burst
into
tears
her
health
grew
worse
from
day
to
day
and
her
body
was
becoming
sheer
skin
and
bone
all
the
while
too
we
had
to
work
to
work
from
morning
till
night
for
we
had
contrived
to
obtain
some
employment
as
occasional
sempstresses
this
however
did
not
please
anna
who
used
to
tell
us
that
there
was
no
room
in
her
house
for
a
modiste
s
establishment
yet
we
had
to
get
clothes
to
wear
to
provide
for
unforeseen
expenses
and
to
have
a
little
money
at
our
disposal
in
case
we
should
some
day
wish
to
remove
elsewhere
unfortunately
the
strain
undermined
my
mother
s
health
and
she
became
gradually
weaker
sickness
like
a
cankerworm
was
gnawing
at
her
life
and
dragging
her
towards
the
tomb
well
could
i
see
what
she
was
enduring
what
she
was
suffering
yes
it
all
lay
open
to
my
eyes
day
succeeded
day
and
each
day
was
like
the
last
one
we
lived
a
life
as
quiet
as
though
we
had
been
in
the
country
anna
herself
grew
quieter
in
proportion
as
she
came
to
realise
the
extent
of
her
power
over
us
in
nothing
did
we
dare
to
thwart
her
from
her
portion
of
the
house
our
apartment
was
divided
by
a
corridor
while
next
to
us
as
mentioned
above
dwelt
a
certain
pokrovski
who
was
engaged
in
teaching
sasha
the
french
and
german
languages
as
well
as
history
and
geography
all
the
sciences
as
anna
used
to
say
in
return
for
these
services
he
received
free
board
and
lodging
as
for
sasha
she
was
a
clever
but
rude
and
uncouth
girl
of
thirteen
on
one
occasion
anna
remarked
to
my
mother
that
it
might
be
as
well
if
i
also
were
to
take
some
lessons
seeing
that
my
education
had
been
neglected
at
school
and
my
mother
joyfully
assenting
i
joined
sasha
for
a
year
in
studying
under
this
pokrovski
the
latter
was
a
poor
a
very
poor
young
man
whose
health
would
not
permit
of
his
undertaking
the
regular
university
course
indeed
it
was
only
for
form
s
sake
that
we
called
him
the
he
lived
in
such
a
quiet
humble
retiring
fashion
that
never
a
sound
reached
us
from
his
room
also
his
exterior
was
peculiar
he
moved
and
walked
awkwardly
and
uttered
his
words
in
such
a
strange
manner
that
at
first
i
could
never
look
at
him
without
laughing
sasha
was
for
ever
playing
tricks
upon
him
more
especially
when
he
was
giving
us
our
lessons
but
unfortunately
he
was
of
a
temperament
as
excitable
as
herself
indeed
he
was
so
irritable
that
the
least
trifle
would
send
him
into
a
frenzy
and
set
him
shouting
at
us
and
complaining
of
our
conduct
sometimes
he
would
even
rush
away
to
his
room
before
school
hours
were
over
and
sit
there
for
days
over
his
books
of
which
he
had
a
store
that
was
both
rare
and
valuable
in
addition
he
acted
as
teacher
at
another
establishment
and
received
payment
for
his
services
there
and
whenever
he
had
received
his
fees
for
this
extra
work
he
would
hasten
off
and
purchase
more
books
in
time
i
got
to
know
and
like
him
better
for
in
reality
he
was
a
good
worthy
fellow
more
so
than
any
of
the
people
with
whom
we
otherwise
came
in
contact
my
mother
in
particular
had
a
great
respect
for
him
and
after
herself
he
was
my
best
friend
but
at
first
i
was
just
an
overgrown
hoyden
and
joined
sasha
in
playing
the
fool
for
hours
we
would
devise
tricks
to
anger
and
distract
him
for
he
looked
extremely
ridiculous
when
he
was
angry
and
so
diverted
us
the
more
ashamed
though
i
am
now
to
admit
it
but
once
when
we
had
driven
him
nearly
to
tears
i
heard
him
say
to
himself
under
his
breath
what
cruel
children
and
instantly
i
repented
i
began
to
feel
sad
and
ashamed
and
sorry
for
him
i
reddened
to
my
ears
and
begged
him
almost
with
tears
not
to
mind
us
nor
to
take
offence
at
our
stupid
jests
nevertheless
without
finishing
the
lesson
he
closed
his
book
and
departed
to
his
own
room
all
that
day
i
felt
torn
with
remorse
to
think
that
we
two
children
had
forced
him
the
poor
the
unhappy
one
to
remember
his
hard
lot
and
at
night
i
could
not
sleep
for
grief
and
regret
remorse
is
said
to
bring
relief
to
the
soul
but
it
is
not
so
how
far
my
grief
was
internally
connected
with
my
conceit
i
do
not
know
but
at
least
i
did
not
wish
him
to
think
me
a
baby
seeing
that
i
had
now
reached
the
age
of
fifteen
years
therefore
from
that
day
onwards
i
began
to
torture
my
imagination
with
devising
a
thousand
schemes
which
should
compel
pokrovski
to
alter
his
opinion
of
me
at
the
same
time
being
yet
shy
and
reserved
by
nature
i
ended
by
finding
that
in
my
present
position
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
nothing
but
vague
dreams
and
such
dreams
i
had
however
i
ceased
to
join
sasha
in
playing
the
fool
while
pokrovski
for
his
part
ceased
to
lose
his
temper
with
us
so
much
unfortunately
this
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
my
at
this
point
i
must
say
a
few
words
about
the
strangest
the
most
interesting
the
most
pitiable
human
being
that
i
have
ever
come
across
i
speak
of
him
now
at
this
particular
point
in
these
memoirs
for
the
reason
that
hitherto
i
had
paid
him
no
attention
whatever
and
began
to
do
so
now
only
because
everything
connected
with
pokrovski
had
suddenly
become
of
absorbing
interest
in
my
eyes
sometimes
there
came
to
the
house
a
ragged
awkward
amorphous
in
short
a
very
little
old
man
at
first
glance
it
might
have
been
thought
that
he
was
perpetually
ashamed
of
something
that
he
had
on
his
conscience
something
which
always
made
him
as
it
were
bristle
up
and
then
shrink
into
himself
such
curious
starts
and
grimaces
did
he
indulge
in
that
one
was
forced
to
conclude
that
he
was
scarcely
in
his
right
mind
on
arriving
he
would
halt
for
a
while
by
the
window
in
the
hall
as
though
afraid
to
enter
until
should
any
one
happen
to
pass
in
or
out
of
the
door
whether
sasha
or
myself
or
one
of
the
servants
to
the
latter
he
always
resorted
the
most
readily
as
being
the
most
nearly
akin
to
his
own
class
he
would
begin
to
gesticulate
and
to
beckon
to
that
person
and
to
make
various
signs
then
should
the
person
in
question
nod
to
him
or
call
him
by
name
the
recognised
token
that
no
other
visitor
was
present
and
that
he
might
enter
freely
he
would
open
the
door
gently
give
a
smile
of
satisfaction
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
proceed
on
tiptoe
to
young
pokrovski
s
room
this
old
fellow
was
none
other
than
pokrovski
s
father
later
i
came
to
know
his
story
in
detail
formerly
a
civil
servant
he
had
possessed
no
additional
means
and
so
had
occupied
a
very
low
and
insignificant
position
in
the
service
then
after
his
first
wife
mother
of
the
younger
pokrovski
had
died
the
widower
bethought
him
of
marrying
a
second
time
and
took
to
himself
a
tradesman
s
daughter
who
soon
assumed
the
reins
over
everything
and
brought
the
home
to
rack
and
ruin
so
that
the
old
man
was
worse
off
than
before
but
to
the
younger
pokrovski
fate
proved
kinder
for
a
landowner
named
bwikov
who
had
formerly
known
the
lad
s
father
and
been
his
benefactor
took
the
boy
under
his
protection
and
sent
him
to
school
another
reason
why
this
bwikov
took
an
interest
in
young
pokrovski
was
that
he
had
known
the
lad
s
dead
mother
who
while
still
a
had
been
befriended
by
anna
thedorovna
and
subsequently
married
to
the
elder
pokrovski
at
the
wedding
bwikov
actuated
by
his
friendship
for
anna
conferred
upon
the
young
bride
a
dowry
of
five
thousand
roubles
but
whither
that
money
had
since
disappeared
i
can
not
say
it
was
from
anna
s
lips
that
i
heard
the
story
for
the
student
pokrovski
was
never
prone
to
talk
about
his
family
affairs
his
mother
was
said
to
have
been
very
wherefore
it
is
the
more
mysterious
why
she
should
have
made
so
poor
a
match
she
died
when
young
only
four
years
after
her
espousal
from
school
the
young
pokrovski
advanced
to
a
gymnasium
secondary
school
and
thence
to
the
university
where
bwikov
who
frequently
visited
the
capital
continued
to
accord
the
youth
his
protection
gradually
however
ill
health
put
an
end
to
the
young
man
s
university
course
whereupon
bwikov
introduced
and
personally
recommended
him
to
anna
thedorovna
and
he
came
to
lodge
with
her
on
condition
that
he
taught
sasha
whatever
might
be
required
of
him
grief
at
the
harshness
of
his
wife
led
the
elder
pokrovski
to
plunge
into
dissipation
and
to
remain
in
an
almost
permanent
condition
of
drunkenness
constantly
his
wife
beat
him
or
sent
him
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
with
the
result
that
in
time
he
became
so
inured
to
blows
and
neglect
that
he
ceased
to
complain
still
not
greatly
advanced
in
years
he
had
nevertheless
endangered
his
reason
through
evil
courses
his
only
sign
of
decent
human
feeling
being
his
love
for
his
son
the
latter
was
said
to
resemble
his
dead
mother
as
one
pea
may
resemble
another
what
recollections
therefore
of
the
kind
helpmeet
of
former
days
may
not
have
moved
the
breast
of
the
poor
broken
old
man
to
this
boundless
affection
for
the
boy
of
naught
else
could
the
father
ever
speak
but
of
his
son
and
never
did
he
fail
to
visit
him
twice
a
week
to
come
oftener
he
did
not
dare
for
the
reason
that
the
younger
pokrovski
did
not
like
these
visits
of
his
father
s
in
fact
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
youth
s
greatest
fault
was
his
lack
of
filial
respect
yet
the
father
was
certainly
rather
a
difficult
person
to
deal
with
for
in
the
first
place
he
was
extremely
inquisitive
while
in
the
second
place
his
conversation
and
questions
questions
of
the
most
vapid
and
senseless
order
conceivable
always
prevented
the
son
from
working
likewise
the
old
man
occasionally
arrived
there
drunk
gradually
however
the
son
was
weaning
his
parent
from
his
vicious
ways
and
everlasting
inquisitiveness
and
teaching
the
old
man
to
look
upon
him
his
son
as
an
oracle
and
never
to
speak
without
that
son
s
permission
on
the
subject
of
his
petinka
as
he
called
him
the
poor
old
man
could
never
sufficiently
rhapsodise
and
dilate
yet
when
he
arrived
to
see
his
son
he
almost
invariably
had
on
his
face
a
downcast
timid
expression
that
was
probably
due
to
uncertainty
concerning
the
way
in
which
he
would
be
received
for
a
long
time
he
would
hesitate
to
enter
and
if
i
happened
to
be
there
he
would
question
me
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
as
to
whether
his
petinka
was
in
good
health
as
well
as
to
the
sort
of
mood
he
was
in
whether
he
was
engaged
on
matters
of
importance
what
precisely
he
was
doing
writing
or
meditating
and
so
on
then
when
i
had
sufficiently
encouraged
and
reassured
the
old
man
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
enter
and
quietly
and
cautiously
open
the
door
next
he
would
protrude
his
head
through
the
chink
and
if
he
saw
that
his
son
was
not
angry
but
threw
him
a
nod
he
would
glide
noiselessly
into
the
room
take
off
his
scarf
and
hang
up
his
hat
the
latter
perennially
in
a
bad
state
of
repair
full
of
holes
and
with
a
smashed
brim
the
whole
being
done
without
a
word
or
a
sound
of
any
kind
next
the
old
man
would
seat
himself
warily
on
a
chair
and
never
removing
his
eyes
from
his
son
follow
his
every
movement
as
though
seeking
to
gauge
petinka
s
state
of
mind
on
the
other
hand
if
the
son
was
not
in
good
spirits
the
father
would
make
a
note
of
the
fact
and
at
once
get
up
saying
that
he
had
only
called
for
a
minute
or
two
that
having
been
out
for
a
long
walk
and
happening
at
the
moment
to
be
passing
he
had
looked
in
for
a
moment
s
then
silently
and
humbly
the
old
man
would
resume
his
hat
and
scarf
softly
he
would
open
the
door
and
noiselessly
depart
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
face
the
better
to
bear
the
disappointment
which
was
seething
in
his
breast
the
better
to
help
him
not
to
show
it
to
his
son
on
the
other
hand
whenever
the
son
received
his
father
civilly
the
old
man
would
be
struck
dumb
with
joy
satisfaction
would
beam
in
his
face
in
his
every
gesture
in
his
every
movement
and
if
the
son
deigned
to
engage
in
conversation
with
him
the
old
man
always
rose
a
little
from
his
chair
and
answered
softly
sympathetically
with
something
like
reverence
while
strenuously
endeavouring
to
make
use
of
the
most
recherche
that
is
to
say
the
most
ridiculous
expressions
but
alas
he
had
not
the
gift
of
words
always
he
grew
confused
and
turned
red
in
the
face
never
did
he
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
or
with
himself
likewise
whenever
he
had
returned
an
answer
of
any
kind
he
would
go
on
repeating
the
same
in
a
whisper
as
though
he
were
seeking
to
justify
what
he
had
just
said
and
if
he
happened
to
have
returned
a
good
answer
he
would
begin
to
preen
himself
and
to
straighten
his
waistcoat
frockcoat
and
tie
and
to
assume
an
air
of
conscious
dignity
indeed
on
these
occasions
he
would
feel
so
encouraged
he
would
carry
his
daring
to
such
a
pitch
that
rising
softly
from
his
chair
he
would
approach
the
bookshelves
take
thence
a
book
and
read
over
to
himself
some
passage
or
another
all
this
he
would
do
with
an
air
of
feigned
indifference
and
sangfroid
as
though
he
were
free
always
to
use
his
son
s
books
and
his
son
s
kindness
were
no
rarity
at
all
yet
on
one
occasion
i
saw
the
poor
old
fellow
actually
turn
pale
on
being
told
by
his
son
not
to
touch
the
books
abashed
and
confused
he
in
his
awkward
hurry
replaced
the
volume
wrong
side
uppermost
whereupon
with
a
supreme
effort
to
recover
himself
he
turned
it
round
with
a
smile
and
a
blush
as
though
he
were
at
a
loss
how
to
view
his
own
misdemeanour
gradually
as
already
said
the
younger
pokrovski
weaned
his
father
from
his
dissipated
ways
by
giving
him
a
small
coin
whenever
on
three
successive
occasions
he
the
father
arrived
sober
sometimes
also
the
younger
man
would
buy
the
older
one
shoes
or
a
tie
or
a
waistcoat
whereafter
the
old
man
would
be
as
proud
of
his
acquisition
as
a
peacock
not
infrequently
also
the
old
man
would
step
in
to
visit
ourselves
and
bring
sasha
and
myself
gingerbread
birds
or
apples
while
talking
unceasingly
of
petinka
always
he
would
beg
of
us
to
pay
attention
to
our
lessons
on
the
plea
that
petinka
was
a
good
son
an
exemplary
son
a
son
who
was
in
twofold
measure
a
man
of
learning
after
which
he
would
wink
at
us
so
quizzingly
with
his
left
eye
and
twist
himself
about
in
such
amusing
fashion
that
we
were
forced
to
burst
out
laughing
my
mother
had
a
great
liking
for
him
but
he
detested
anna
thedorovna
although
in
her
presence
he
would
be
quieter
than
water
and
lowlier
than
the
earth
soon
after
this
i
ceased
to
take
lessons
of
pokrovski
even
now
he
thought
me
a
child
a
raw
schoolgirl
as
much
as
he
did
sasha
and
this
hurt
me
extremely
seeing
that
i
had
done
so
much
to
expiate
my
former
behaviour
of
my
efforts
in
this
direction
no
notice
had
been
taken
and
the
fact
continued
to
anger
me
more
and
more
scarcely
ever
did
i
address
a
word
to
my
tutor
between
school
hours
for
i
simply
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
if
i
made
the
attempt
i
only
grew
red
and
confused
and
rushed
away
to
weep
in
a
corner
how
it
would
all
have
ended
i
do
not
know
had
not
a
curious
incident
helped
to
bring
about
a
rapprochement
one
evening
when
my
mother
was
sitting
in
anna
thedorovna
s
room
i
crept
on
tiptoe
to
pokrovski
s
apartment
in
the
belief
that
he
was
not
at
home
some
strange
impulse
moved
me
to
do
so
true
we
had
lived
cheek
by
jowl
with
one
another
yet
never
once
had
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
abode
consequently
my
heart
beat
loudly
so
loudly
indeed
that
it
seemed
almost
to
be
bursting
from
my
breast
on
entering
the
room
i
glanced
around
me
with
tense
interest
the
apartment
was
very
poorly
furnished
and
bore
few
traces
of
orderliness
on
table
and
chairs
there
lay
heaps
of
books
everywhere
were
books
and
papers
then
a
strange
thought
entered
my
head
as
well
as
with
the
thought
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
irritation
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
friendship
my
heart
s
affection
meant
little
to
him
for
he
was
whereas
i
was
stupid
and
had
learned
nothing
and
had
read
not
a
single
book
so
i
stood
looking
wistfully
at
the
long
bookshelves
where
they
groaned
under
their
weight
of
volumes
i
felt
filled
with
grief
disappointment
and
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
felt
that
i
must
read
those
books
and
decided
to
do
so
to
read
them
one
by
one
and
with
all
possible
speed
probably
the
idea
was
that
by
learning
whatsoever
he
knew
i
should
render
myself
more
worthy
of
his
friendship
so
i
made
a
rush
towards
the
bookcase
nearest
me
and
without
stopping
further
to
consider
matters
seized
hold
of
the
first
dusty
tome
upon
which
my
hands
chanced
to
alight
and
reddening
and
growing
pale
by
turns
and
trembling
with
fear
and
excitement
clasped
the
stolen
book
to
my
breast
with
the
intention
of
reading
it
by
candle
light
while
my
mother
lay
asleep
at
night
but
how
vexed
i
felt
when
on
returning
to
our
own
room
and
hastily
turning
the
pages
only
an
old
battered
latin
work
greeted
my
eyes
without
loss
of
time
i
retraced
my
steps
just
when
i
was
about
to
replace
the
book
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
corridor
outside
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
fumblingly
i
hastened
to
complete
what
i
was
about
but
the
tiresome
book
had
become
so
tightly
wedged
into
its
row
that
on
being
pulled
out
it
caused
its
fellows
to
close
up
too
compactly
to
leave
any
place
for
their
comrade
to
insert
the
book
was
beyond
my
strength
yet
still
i
kept
pushing
and
pushing
at
the
row
at
last
the
rusty
nail
which
supported
the
shelf
the
thing
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
on
purpose
for
that
moment
broke
off
short
with
the
result
that
the
shelf
descended
with
a
crash
and
the
books
piled
themselves
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
then
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
pokrovski
entered
i
must
here
remark
that
he
never
could
bear
to
have
his
possessions
tampered
with
woe
to
the
person
in
particular
who
touched
his
books
judge
therefore
of
my
horror
when
books
small
and
great
books
of
every
possible
shape
and
size
and
thickness
came
tumbling
from
the
shelf
and
flew
and
sprang
over
the
table
and
under
the
chairs
and
about
the
whole
room
i
would
have
turned
and
fled
but
it
was
too
late
all
is
over
thought
i
all
is
over
i
am
ruined
i
am
undone
here
have
i
been
playing
the
fool
like
a
child
what
a
stupid
girl
i
am
the
monstrous
fool
indeed
pokrovski
was
very
angry
what
have
you
not
done
enough
he
cried
are
you
not
ashamed
to
be
for
ever
indulging
in
such
pranks
are
you
never
going
to
grow
sensible
with
that
he
darted
forward
to
pick
up
the
books
while
i
bent
down
to
help
him
you
need
not
you
need
not
he
went
on
you
would
have
done
far
better
not
to
have
entered
without
an
next
a
little
mollified
by
my
humble
demeanour
he
resumed
in
his
usual
tutorial
tone
the
tone
which
he
had
adopted
in
his
role
of
preceptor
when
are
you
going
to
grow
steadier
and
more
thoughtful
consider
yourself
for
a
moment
you
are
no
longer
a
child
a
little
girl
but
a
maiden
of
then
with
a
desire
probably
to
satisfy
himself
that
i
was
no
longer
a
being
of
tender
years
he
threw
me
a
glance
but
straightway
reddened
to
his
very
ears
this
i
could
not
understand
but
stood
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
presently
he
straightened
himself
a
little
approached
me
with
a
sort
of
confused
expression
and
haltingly
said
something
probably
it
was
an
apology
for
not
having
before
perceived
that
i
was
now
a
young
person
but
the
next
moment
i
understood
what
i
did
i
hardly
know
save
that
in
my
dismay
and
confusion
i
blushed
even
more
hotly
than
he
had
done
and
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
rushed
from
the
room
what
to
do
with
myself
for
shame
i
could
not
think
the
one
thought
in
my
head
was
that
he
had
surprised
me
in
his
room
for
three
whole
days
i
found
myself
unable
to
raise
my
eyes
to
his
but
blushed
always
to
the
point
of
weeping
the
strangest
and
most
confused
of
thoughts
kept
entering
my
brain
one
of
them
the
most
extravagant
was
that
i
should
dearly
like
to
go
to
pokrovski
and
to
explain
to
him
the
situation
and
to
make
full
confession
and
to
tell
him
everything
without
concealment
and
to
assure
him
that
i
had
not
acted
foolishly
as
a
minx
but
honestly
and
of
set
purpose
in
fact
i
did
make
up
my
mind
to
take
this
course
but
lacked
the
necessary
courage
to
do
it
if
i
had
done
so
what
a
figure
i
should
have
cut
even
now
i
am
ashamed
to
think
of
it
a
few
days
later
my
mother
suddenly
fell
dangerously
for
two
days
past
she
had
not
left
her
bed
while
during
the
third
night
of
her
illness
she
became
seized
with
fever
and
delirium
i
also
had
not
closed
my
eyes
during
the
previous
night
but
now
waited
upon
my
mother
sat
by
her
bed
brought
her
drink
at
intervals
and
gave
her
medicine
at
duly
appointed
hours
the
next
night
i
suffered
terribly
every
now
and
then
sleep
would
cause
me
to
nod
and
objects
grow
dim
before
my
eyes
also
my
head
was
turning
dizzy
and
i
could
have
fainted
for
very
weariness
yet
always
my
mother
s
feeble
moans
recalled
me
to
myself
as
i
started
momentarily
awoke
and
then
again
felt
drowsiness
overcoming
me
what
torture
it
was
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
clearly
remember
but
i
think
that
during
a
moment
when
wakefulness
was
thus
contending
with
slumber
a
strange
dream
a
horrible
vision
visited
my
overwrought
brain
and
i
awoke
in
terror
the
room
was
nearly
in
darkness
for
the
candle
was
flickering
and
throwing
stray
beams
of
light
which
suddenly
illuminated
the
room
danced
for
a
moment
on
the
walls
and
then
disappeared
somehow
i
felt
afraid
a
sort
of
horror
had
come
upon
me
my
imagination
had
been
by
the
evil
dream
which
i
had
experienced
and
a
feeling
of
oppression
was
crushing
my
heart
i
leapt
from
the
chair
and
involuntarily
uttered
a
cry
a
cry
wrung
from
me
by
the
terrible
torturing
sensation
that
was
upon
me
presently
the
door
opened
and
pokrovski
entered
i
remember
that
i
was
in
his
arms
when
i
recovered
my
senses
carefully
seating
me
on
a
bench
he
handed
me
a
glass
of
water
and
then
asked
me
a
few
questions
though
how
i
answered
them
i
do
not
know
you
yourself
are
ill
he
said
as
he
took
my
hand
you
yourself
are
very
you
are
feverish
and
i
can
see
that
you
are
knocking
yourself
out
through
your
neglect
of
your
own
health
take
a
little
rest
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
yes
lie
down
lie
down
he
continued
without
giving
me
time
to
protest
indeed
fatigue
had
so
exhausted
my
strength
that
my
eyes
were
closing
from
very
weakness
so
i
lay
down
on
the
bench
with
the
intention
of
sleeping
for
half
an
hour
only
but
i
slept
till
morning
pokrovski
then
awoke
me
saying
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
and
give
my
mother
her
medicine
when
the
next
evening
about
eight
o
clock
i
had
rested
a
little
and
was
preparing
to
spend
the
night
in
a
chair
beside
my
mother
fixedly
meaning
not
to
go
to
sleep
this
time
pokrovski
suddenly
knocked
at
the
door
i
opened
it
and
he
informed
me
that
since
possibly
i
might
find
the
time
wearisome
he
had
brought
me
a
few
books
to
read
i
accepted
the
books
but
do
not
even
now
know
what
books
they
were
nor
whether
i
looked
into
them
despite
the
fact
that
i
never
closed
my
eyes
the
whole
night
long
the
truth
was
that
a
strange
feeling
of
excitement
was
preventing
me
from
sleeping
and
i
could
not
rest
long
in
any
one
spot
but
had
to
keep
rising
from
my
chair
and
walking
about
the
room
throughout
my
whole
being
there
seemed
to
be
diffused
a
kind
of
elation
of
elation
at
pokrovski
s
attentions
at
the
thought
that
he
was
anxious
and
uneasy
about
me
until
dawn
i
pondered
and
dreamed
and
though
i
felt
sure
pokrovski
would
not
again
visit
us
that
night
i
gave
myself
up
to
fancies
concerning
what
he
might
do
the
following
evening
that
evening
when
everyone
else
in
the
house
had
retired
to
rest
pokrovski
opened
his
door
and
opened
a
conversation
from
the
threshold
of
his
room
although
at
this
distance
of
time
i
can
not
remember
a
word
of
what
we
said
to
one
another
i
remember
that
i
blushed
grew
confused
felt
vexed
with
myself
and
awaited
with
impatience
the
end
of
the
conversation
although
i
myself
had
been
longing
for
the
meeting
to
take
place
and
had
spent
the
day
in
dreaming
of
it
and
devising
a
string
of
suitable
questions
and
replies
yes
that
evening
saw
the
first
strand
in
our
friendship
knitted
and
each
subsequent
night
of
my
mother
s
illness
we
spent
several
hours
together
little
by
little
i
overcame
his
reserve
but
found
that
each
of
these
conversations
left
me
filled
with
a
sense
of
vexation
at
myself
at
the
same
time
i
could
see
with
secret
joy
and
a
sense
of
proud
elation
that
i
was
leading
him
to
forget
his
tiresome
books
at
last
the
conversation
turned
jestingly
upon
the
upsetting
of
the
shelf
the
moment
was
a
peculiar
one
for
it
came
upon
me
just
when
i
was
in
the
right
mood
for
and
candour
in
my
ardour
my
curious
phase
of
exaltation
i
found
myself
led
to
make
a
full
confession
of
the
fact
that
i
had
become
wishful
to
learn
to
know
something
since
i
had
felt
hurt
at
being
taken
for
a
chit
a
mere
baby
i
repeat
that
that
night
i
was
in
a
very
strange
frame
of
mind
my
heart
was
inclined
to
be
tender
and
there
were
tears
standing
in
my
eyes
nothing
did
i
conceal
as
i
told
him
about
my
friendship
for
him
about
my
desire
to
love
him
about
my
scheme
for
living
in
sympathy
with
him
and
comforting
him
and
making
his
life
easier
in
return
he
threw
me
a
look
of
confusion
mingled
with
astonishment
and
said
nothing
then
suddenly
i
began
to
feel
terribly
pained
and
disappointed
for
i
conceived
that
he
had
failed
to
understand
me
or
even
that
he
might
be
laughing
at
me
bursting
into
tears
like
a
child
i
sobbed
and
could
not
stop
myself
for
i
had
fallen
into
a
kind
of
fit
whereupon
he
seized
my
hand
kissed
it
and
clasped
it
to
his
breast
saying
various
things
meanwhile
to
comfort
me
for
he
was
labouring
under
a
strong
emotion
exactly
what
he
said
i
do
not
remember
i
merely
wept
and
laughed
by
turns
and
blushed
and
found
myself
unable
to
speak
a
word
for
joy
yet
for
all
my
agitation
i
noticed
that
about
him
there
still
lingered
an
air
of
constraint
and
uneasiness
evidently
he
was
lost
in
wonder
at
my
enthusiasm
and
raptures
at
my
curiously
ardent
unexpected
consuming
friendship
it
may
be
that
at
first
he
was
amazed
but
that
afterwards
he
accepted
my
devotion
and
words
of
invitation
and
expressions
of
interest
with
the
same
simple
frankness
as
i
had
offered
them
and
responded
to
them
with
an
interest
a
friendliness
a
devotion
equal
to
my
own
even
as
a
friend
or
a
brother
would
do
how
happy
how
warm
was
the
feeling
in
my
heart
nothing
had
i
concealed
or
repressed
no
i
had
bared
all
to
his
sight
and
each
day
would
see
him
draw
nearer
to
me
truly
i
could
not
say
what
we
did
not
talk
about
during
those
painful
yet
rapturous
hours
when
by
the
trembling
light
of
a
lamp
and
almost
at
the
very
bedside
of
my
poor
sick
mother
we
kept
midnight
tryst
whatsoever
first
came
into
our
heads
we
spoke
of
whatsoever
came
riven
from
our
hearts
whatsoever
seemed
to
call
for
utterance
found
voice
and
almost
always
we
were
happy
what
a
grievous
yet
joyous
period
it
was
a
period
grievous
and
joyous
at
the
same
time
to
this
day
it
both
hurts
and
delights
me
to
recall
it
joyous
or
bitter
though
it
was
its
memories
are
yet
painful
at
least
they
seem
so
to
me
though
a
certain
sweetness
assuaged
the
pain
so
whenever
i
am
feeling
heartsick
and
oppressed
and
jaded
and
sad
those
memories
return
to
freshen
and
revive
me
even
as
drops
of
evening
dew
return
to
freshen
and
revive
after
a
sultry
day
the
poor
faded
flower
which
has
long
been
drooping
in
the
noontide
heat
my
mother
grew
better
but
still
i
continued
to
spend
the
nights
on
a
chair
by
her
bedside
often
too
pokrovski
would
give
me
books
at
first
i
read
them
merely
so
as
to
avoid
going
to
sleep
but
afterwards
i
examined
them
with
more
attention
and
subsequently
with
actual
avidity
for
they
opened
up
to
me
a
new
an
unexpected
an
unknown
an
unfamiliar
world
new
thoughts
added
to
new
impressions
would
come
pouring
into
my
heart
in
a
rich
flood
and
the
more
emotion
the
more
pain
and
labour
it
cost
me
to
assimilate
these
new
impressions
the
dearer
did
they
become
to
me
and
the
more
gratefully
did
they
stir
my
soul
to
its
very
depths
crowding
into
my
heart
without
giving
it
time
even
to
breathe
they
would
cause
my
whole
being
to
become
lost
in
a
wondrous
chaos
yet
this
spiritual
ferment
was
not
sufficiently
strong
wholly
to
undo
me
for
that
i
was
too
fanciful
and
the
fact
saved
me
with
the
passing
of
my
mother
s
illness
the
midnight
meetings
and
long
conversations
between
myself
and
pokrovski
came
to
an
end
only
occasionally
did
we
exchange
a
few
words
with
one
another
words
for
the
most
part
that
were
of
little
purport
or
substance
yet
words
to
which
it
delighted
me
to
apportion
their
several
meanings
their
peculiar
secret
values
my
life
had
now
become
full
i
was
happy
i
was
quietly
restfully
happy
thus
did
several
weeks
elapse
one
day
the
elder
pokrovski
came
to
see
us
and
chattered
in
a
brisk
cheerful
garrulous
sort
of
way
he
laughed
launched
out
into
witticisms
and
finally
resolved
the
riddle
of
his
transports
by
informing
us
that
in
a
week
s
time
it
would
be
his
petinka
s
birthday
when
in
honour
of
the
occasion
he
the
father
meant
to
don
a
new
jacket
as
well
as
new
shoes
which
his
wife
was
going
to
buy
for
him
and
to
come
and
pay
a
visit
to
his
son
in
short
the
old
man
was
perfectly
happy
and
gossiped
about
whatsoever
first
entered
his
head
my
lover
s
birthday
thenceforward
i
could
not
rest
by
night
or
day
whatever
might
happen
it
was
my
fixed
intention
to
remind
pokrovski
of
our
friendship
by
giving
him
a
present
but
what
sort
of
present
finally
i
decided
to
give
him
books
i
knew
that
he
had
long
wanted
to
possess
a
complete
set
of
pushkin
s
works
in
the
latest
edition
so
i
decided
to
buy
pushkin
my
private
fund
consisted
of
thirty
roubles
earned
by
handiwork
and
designed
eventually
to
procure
me
a
new
dress
but
at
once
i
dispatched
our
cook
old
matrena
to
ascertain
the
price
of
such
an
edition
horrors
the
price
of
the
eleven
volumes
added
to
extra
outlay
upon
the
binding
would
amount
to
at
least
sixty
roubles
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
i
thought
and
thought
yet
could
not
decide
i
did
not
like
to
resort
to
my
mother
of
course
she
would
help
me
but
in
that
case
every
one
in
the
house
would
become
aware
of
my
gift
and
the
gift
itself
would
assume
the
guise
of
a
recompense
of
payment
for
pokrovski
s
labours
on
my
behalf
during
the
past
year
whereas
i
wished
to
present
the
gift
alone
and
without
the
knowledge
of
anyone
for
the
trouble
that
he
had
taken
with
me
i
wished
to
be
his
perpetual
debtor
to
make
him
no
payment
at
all
save
my
friendship
at
length
i
thought
of
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
knew
that
of
the
hucksters
in
the
gostinni
dvor
one
could
sometimes
buy
a
book
even
one
that
had
been
little
used
and
was
almost
entirely
new
for
a
half
of
its
price
provided
that
one
haggled
sufficiently
over
it
wherefore
i
determined
to
repair
thither
it
so
happened
that
next
day
both
anna
thedorovna
and
ourselves
were
in
want
of
sundry
articles
and
since
my
mother
was
unwell
and
anna
lazy
the
execution
of
the
commissions
devolved
upon
me
and
i
set
forth
with
matrena
luckily
i
soon
chanced
upon
a
set
of
pushkin
handsomely
bound
and
set
myself
to
bargain
for
it
at
first
more
was
demanded
than
would
have
been
asked
of
me
in
a
shop
but
afterwards
though
not
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
on
my
part
and
several
feints
at
departing
i
induced
the
dealer
to
lower
his
price
and
to
limit
his
demands
to
ten
roubles
in
silver
how
i
rejoiced
that
i
had
engaged
in
this
bargaining
poor
matrena
could
not
imagine
what
had
come
to
me
nor
why
i
so
desired
to
buy
books
but
oh
horror
of
horrors
as
soon
as
ever
the
dealer
caught
sight
of
my
capital
of
thirty
roubles
in
notes
he
refused
to
let
the
pushkin
go
for
less
than
the
sum
he
had
first
named
and
though
in
answer
to
my
prayers
and
protestations
he
eventually
yielded
a
little
he
did
so
only
to
the
tune
of
roubles
more
than
i
possessed
while
swearing
that
he
was
making
the
concession
for
my
sake
alone
since
i
was
a
sweet
young
lady
and
that
he
would
have
done
so
for
no
one
else
in
the
world
to
think
that
only
roubles
should
still
be
wanting
i
could
have
wept
with
vexation
suddenly
an
circumstance
occurred
to
help
me
in
my
distress
not
far
away
near
another
table
that
was
heaped
with
books
i
perceived
the
elder
pokrovski
and
a
crowd
of
four
or
five
hucksters
plaguing
him
nearly
out
of
his
senses
each
of
these
fellows
was
proffering
the
old
man
his
own
particular
wares
and
while
there
was
nothing
that
they
did
not
submit
for
his
approval
there
was
nothing
that
he
wished
to
buy
the
poor
old
fellow
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
receiving
a
thrashing
what
to
make
of
what
he
was
being
offered
him
he
did
not
know
approaching
him
i
inquired
what
he
happened
to
be
doing
there
whereat
the
old
man
was
delighted
since
he
liked
me
it
may
be
no
less
than
he
did
petinka
i
am
buying
some
books
barbara
alexievna
said
he
i
am
buying
them
for
my
petinka
it
will
be
his
birthday
soon
and
since
he
likes
books
i
thought
i
would
get
him
the
old
man
always
expressed
himself
in
a
very
roundabout
sort
of
fashion
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
doubly
terribly
confused
of
no
matter
what
book
he
asked
the
price
it
was
sure
to
be
one
two
or
three
roubles
the
larger
books
he
could
not
afford
at
all
he
could
only
look
at
them
wistfully
fumble
their
leaves
with
his
finger
turn
over
the
volumes
in
his
hands
and
then
replace
them
no
no
that
is
too
dear
he
would
mutter
under
his
breath
i
must
go
and
try
somewhere
then
again
he
would
fall
to
examining
collections
of
poems
and
almanacs
of
the
cheaper
order
why
should
you
buy
things
like
those
i
asked
him
they
are
such
rubbish
no
no
he
replied
see
what
nice
books
they
are
yes
they
are
nice
books
yet
these
last
words
he
uttered
so
lingeringly
that
i
could
see
he
was
ready
to
weep
with
vexation
at
finding
the
better
sorts
of
books
so
expensive
already
a
little
tear
was
trickling
down
his
pale
cheeks
and
red
nose
i
inquired
whether
he
had
much
money
on
him
whereupon
the
poor
old
fellow
pulled
out
his
entire
stock
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
dirty
newspaper
and
consisting
of
a
few
small
silver
coins
with
twenty
kopecks
in
copper
at
once
i
seized
the
lot
and
dragging
him
off
to
my
huckster
said
look
here
these
eleven
volumes
of
pushkin
are
priced
at
roubles
and
i
have
only
thirty
roubles
let
us
add
to
them
these
roubles
of
yours
and
buy
the
books
together
and
make
them
our
joint
the
old
man
was
overjoyed
and
pulled
out
his
money
en
masse
whereupon
the
huckster
loaded
him
with
our
common
library
stuffing
it
into
his
pockets
as
well
as
filling
both
arms
with
it
he
departed
homewards
with
his
prize
after
giving
me
his
word
to
bring
me
the
books
privately
on
the
morrow
next
day
the
old
man
came
to
see
his
son
and
sat
with
him
as
usual
for
about
an
hour
after
which
he
visited
ourselves
wearing
on
his
face
the
most
comical
the
most
mysterious
expression
conceivable
smiling
broadly
with
satisfaction
at
the
thought
that
he
was
the
possessor
of
a
secret
he
informed
me
that
he
had
stealthily
brought
the
books
to
our
rooms
and
hidden
them
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
under
matrena
s
care
next
by
a
natural
transition
the
conversation
passed
to
the
coming
whereupon
the
old
man
proceeded
to
hold
forth
extensively
on
the
subject
of
gifts
the
further
he
delved
into
his
thesis
and
the
more
he
expounded
it
the
clearer
could
i
see
that
on
his
mind
there
was
something
which
he
could
not
dared
not
divulge
so
i
waited
and
kept
silent
the
mysterious
exaltation
the
repressed
satisfaction
which
i
had
hitherto
discerned
in
his
antics
and
grimaces
and
winks
gradually
disappeared
and
he
began
to
grow
momentarily
more
anxious
and
uneasy
at
length
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
listen
barbara
alexievna
he
said
timidly
listen
to
what
i
have
got
to
say
to
you
when
his
birthday
is
come
do
you
take
ten
of
the
books
and
give
them
to
him
yourself
that
is
for
yourself
as
being
your
share
of
the
gift
then
i
will
take
the
eleventh
book
and
give
it
to
him
myself
as
being
my
gift
if
we
do
that
you
will
have
a
present
for
him
and
i
shall
have
one
both
of
us
why
do
you
not
want
us
to
present
our
gifts
together
zachar
petrovitch
i
asked
him
oh
very
well
he
replied
very
well
barbara
alexievna
only
only
i
thought
that
the
old
man
broke
off
in
confusion
while
his
face
flushed
with
the
exertion
of
thus
expressing
himself
for
a
moment
or
two
he
sat
glued
to
his
seat
you
see
he
went
on
i
play
the
fool
too
much
i
am
forever
playing
the
fool
and
can
not
help
myself
though
i
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
do
so
at
home
it
is
often
cold
and
sometimes
there
are
other
troubles
as
well
and
it
all
makes
me
depressed
well
whenever
that
happens
i
indulge
a
little
and
occasionally
drink
too
much
now
petinka
does
not
like
that
he
loses
his
temper
about
it
barbara
alexievna
and
scolds
me
and
reads
me
lectures
so
i
want
by
my
gift
to
show
him
that
i
am
mending
my
ways
and
beginning
to
conduct
myself
better
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
been
saving
up
to
buy
him
a
book
yes
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
been
saving
up
for
it
since
it
is
seldom
that
i
have
any
money
unless
petinka
happens
to
give
me
some
he
knows
that
and
consequently
as
soon
as
ever
he
perceives
the
use
to
which
i
have
put
his
money
he
will
understand
that
it
is
for
his
sake
alone
that
i
have
my
heart
ached
for
the
old
man
seeing
him
looking
at
me
with
such
anxiety
i
made
up
my
mind
without
delay
i
tell
you
what
i
said
do
you
give
him
all
the
all
he
ejaculated
all
the
books
yes
all
of
as
my
own
gift
yes
as
your
own
as
my
gift
alone
yes
as
your
gift
surely
i
had
spoken
clearly
enough
yet
the
old
man
seemed
hardly
to
understand
me
well
said
he
after
reflection
that
certainly
would
be
splendid
certainly
it
would
be
most
splendid
but
what
about
yourself
barbara
alexievna
oh
i
shall
give
your
son
what
he
cried
in
dismay
are
you
going
to
give
petinka
nothing
do
you
wish
to
give
him
nothing
so
put
about
was
the
old
fellow
with
what
i
had
said
that
he
seemed
almost
ready
to
renounce
his
own
proposal
if
only
i
would
give
his
son
something
what
a
kind
heart
he
had
i
hastened
to
assure
him
that
i
should
certainly
have
a
gift
of
some
sort
ready
since
my
one
wish
was
to
avoid
spoiling
his
pleasure
provided
that
your
son
is
pleased
i
added
and
that
you
are
pleased
i
shall
be
equally
pleased
for
in
my
secret
heart
i
shall
feel
as
though
i
had
presented
the
this
fully
reassured
the
old
man
he
stopped
with
us
another
couple
of
hours
yet
could
not
sit
still
for
a
moment
but
kept
jumping
up
from
his
seat
laughing
cracking
jokes
with
sasha
bestowing
stealthy
kisses
upon
myself
pinching
my
hands
and
making
silent
grimaces
at
anna
thedorovna
at
length
she
turned
him
out
of
the
house
in
short
his
transports
of
joy
exceeded
anything
that
i
had
yet
beheld
on
the
festal
day
he
arrived
exactly
at
eleven
o
clock
direct
from
mass
he
was
dressed
in
a
carefully
mended
frockcoat
a
new
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
new
shoes
while
in
his
arms
he
carried
our
pile
of
books
next
we
all
sat
down
to
coffee
the
day
being
sunday
in
anna
thedorovna
s
parlour
the
old
man
led
off
the
meal
by
saying
that
pushkin
was
a
magnificent
poet
thereafter
with
a
return
to
shamefacedness
and
confusion
he
passed
suddenly
to
the
statement
that
a
man
ought
to
conduct
himself
properly
that
should
he
not
do
so
it
might
be
taken
as
a
sign
that
he
was
in
some
way
overindulging
himself
and
that
evil
tendencies
of
this
sort
led
to
the
man
s
ruin
and
degradation
then
the
orator
sketched
for
our
benefit
some
terrible
instances
of
such
incontinence
and
concluded
by
informing
us
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
mending
his
own
ways
and
conducting
himself
in
exemplary
fashion
for
the
reason
that
he
had
perceived
the
justice
of
his
son
s
precepts
and
had
laid
them
to
heart
so
well
that
he
the
father
had
really
changed
for
the
better
in
proof
whereof
he
now
begged
to
present
to
the
said
son
some
books
for
which
he
had
long
been
setting
aside
his
savings
as
i
listened
to
the
old
man
i
could
not
help
laughing
and
crying
in
a
breath
certainly
he
knew
how
to
lie
when
the
occasion
required
the
books
were
transferred
to
his
son
s
room
and
arranged
upon
a
shelf
where
pokrovski
at
once
guessed
the
truth
about
them
then
the
old
man
was
invited
to
dinner
and
we
all
spent
a
merry
day
together
at
cards
and
forfeits
sasha
was
full
of
life
and
i
rivalled
her
while
pokrovski
paid
me
numerous
attentions
and
kept
seeking
an
occasion
to
speak
to
me
alone
but
to
allow
this
to
happen
i
refused
yes
taken
all
in
all
it
was
the
happiest
day
that
i
had
known
for
four
years
but
now
only
grievous
painful
memories
come
to
my
recollection
for
i
must
enter
upon
the
story
of
my
darker
experiences
it
may
be
that
that
is
why
my
pen
begins
to
move
more
slowly
and
seems
as
though
it
were
going
altogether
to
refuse
to
write
the
same
reason
may
account
for
my
having
undertaken
so
lovingly
and
enthusiastically
a
recounting
of
even
the
smallest
details
of
my
younger
happier
days
but
alas
those
days
did
not
last
long
and
were
succeeded
by
a
period
of
black
sorrow
which
will
close
only
god
knows
when
my
misfortunes
began
with
the
illness
and
death
of
pokrovski
who
was
taken
worse
two
months
after
what
i
have
last
recorded
in
these
memoirs
during
those
two
months
he
worked
hard
to
procure
himself
a
livelihood
since
hitherto
he
had
had
no
assured
position
like
all
consumptives
he
never
not
even
up
to
his
last
moment
altogether
abandoned
the
hope
of
being
able
to
enjoy
a
long
life
a
post
as
tutor
fell
in
his
way
but
he
had
never
liked
the
profession
while
for
him
to
become
a
civil
servant
was
out
of
the
question
owing
to
his
weak
state
of
health
moreover
in
the
latter
capacity
he
would
have
had
to
have
waited
a
long
time
for
his
first
instalment
of
salary
again
he
always
looked
at
the
darker
side
of
things
for
his
character
was
gradually
being
warped
and
his
health
undermined
by
his
illness
though
he
never
noticed
it
then
autumn
came
on
and
daily
he
went
out
to
business
that
is
to
say
to
apply
for
and
to
canvass
for
posts
clad
only
in
a
light
jacket
with
the
result
that
after
repeated
soakings
with
rain
he
had
to
take
to
his
bed
and
never
again
left
it
he
died
in
at
the
close
of
the
month
of
october
throughout
his
illness
i
scarcely
ever
left
his
room
but
waited
on
him
hand
and
foot
often
he
could
not
sleep
for
several
nights
at
a
time
often
too
he
was
unconscious
or
else
in
a
delirium
and
at
such
times
he
would
talk
of
all
sorts
of
things
of
his
work
of
his
books
of
his
father
of
myself
at
such
times
i
learned
much
which
i
had
not
hitherto
known
or
divined
about
his
affairs
during
the
early
part
of
his
illness
everyone
in
the
house
looked
askance
at
me
and
anna
thedorovna
would
nod
her
head
in
a
meaning
manner
but
i
always
looked
them
straight
in
the
face
and
gradually
they
ceased
to
take
any
notice
of
my
concern
for
pokrovski
at
all
events
my
mother
ceased
to
trouble
her
head
about
it
sometimes
pokrovski
would
know
who
i
was
but
not
often
for
more
usually
he
was
unconscious
sometimes
too
he
would
talk
all
night
with
some
unknown
person
in
dim
mysterious
language
that
caused
his
gasping
voice
to
echo
hoarsely
through
the
narrow
room
as
through
a
sepulchre
and
at
such
times
i
found
the
situation
a
strange
one
during
his
last
night
he
was
especially
lightheaded
for
then
he
was
in
terrible
agony
and
kept
rambling
in
his
speech
until
my
soul
was
torn
with
pity
everyone
in
the
house
was
alarmed
and
anna
thedorovna
fell
to
praying
that
god
might
soon
take
him
when
the
doctor
had
been
summoned
the
verdict
was
that
the
patient
would
die
with
the
morning
that
night
the
elder
pokrovski
spent
in
the
corridor
at
the
door
of
his
son
s
room
though
given
a
mattress
to
lie
upon
he
spent
his
time
in
running
in
and
out
of
the
apartment
so
broken
with
grief
was
he
that
he
presented
a
dreadful
spectacle
and
appeared
to
have
lost
both
perception
and
feeling
his
head
trembled
with
agony
and
his
body
quivered
from
head
to
foot
as
at
times
he
murmured
to
himself
something
which
he
appeared
to
be
debating
every
moment
i
expected
to
see
him
go
out
of
his
mind
just
before
dawn
he
succumbed
to
the
stress
of
mental
agony
and
fell
asleep
on
his
mattress
like
a
man
who
has
been
beaten
but
by
eight
o
clock
the
son
was
at
the
point
of
death
and
i
ran
to
wake
the
father
the
dying
man
was
quite
conscious
and
bid
us
all
farewell
somehow
i
could
not
weep
though
my
heart
seemed
to
be
breaking
the
last
moments
were
the
most
harassing
and
heartbreaking
of
all
for
some
time
past
pokrovski
had
been
asking
for
something
with
his
failing
tongue
but
i
had
been
unable
to
distinguish
his
words
yet
my
heart
had
been
bursting
with
grief
then
for
an
hour
he
had
lain
quieter
except
that
he
had
looked
sadly
in
my
direction
and
striven
to
make
some
sign
with
his
hands
at
last
he
again
essayed
his
piteous
request
in
a
hoarse
deep
voice
but
the
words
issued
in
so
many
inarticulate
sounds
and
once
more
i
failed
to
divine
his
meaning
by
turns
i
brought
each
member
of
the
household
to
his
bedside
and
gave
him
something
to
drink
but
he
only
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
finally
i
understood
what
it
was
he
wanted
he
was
asking
me
to
draw
aside
the
curtain
from
the
window
and
to
open
the
casements
probably
he
wished
to
take
his
last
look
at
the
daylight
and
the
sun
and
all
god
s
world
i
pulled
back
the
curtain
but
the
opening
day
was
as
dull
and
mournful
looking
as
though
it
had
been
the
life
of
the
poor
invalid
of
sunshine
there
was
none
clouds
overlaid
the
sky
as
with
a
shroud
of
mist
and
everything
looked
sad
rainy
and
threatening
under
a
fine
drizzle
which
was
beating
against
the
and
streaking
their
dull
dark
surfaces
with
runlets
of
cold
dirty
moisture
only
a
scanty
modicum
of
daylight
entered
to
war
with
the
trembling
rays
of
the
ikon
lamp
the
dying
man
threw
me
a
wistful
look
and
nodded
the
next
moment
he
had
passed
away
the
funeral
was
arranged
for
by
anna
thedorovna
a
plain
coffin
was
bought
and
a
hearse
hired
while
as
security
for
this
outlay
she
seized
the
dead
man
s
books
and
other
articles
nevertheless
the
old
man
disputed
the
books
with
her
and
raising
an
uproar
carried
off
as
many
of
them
as
he
could
stuffing
his
pockets
full
and
even
filling
his
hat
indeed
he
spent
the
next
three
days
with
them
thus
and
refused
to
let
them
leave
his
sight
even
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
to
church
throughout
he
acted
like
a
man
bereft
of
sense
and
memory
with
quaint
assiduity
he
busied
himself
about
the
bier
now
straightening
the
candlestick
on
the
dead
man
s
breast
now
snuffing
and
lighting
the
other
candles
clearly
his
thoughts
were
powerless
to
remain
long
fixed
on
any
subject
neither
my
mother
nor
anna
thedorovna
were
present
at
the
requiem
for
the
former
was
ill
and
the
latter
was
at
loggerheads
with
the
old
man
only
myself
and
the
father
were
there
during
the
service
a
sort
of
panic
a
sort
of
premonition
of
the
future
came
over
me
and
i
could
hardly
hold
myself
upright
at
length
the
coffin
had
received
its
burden
and
was
screwed
down
after
which
the
bearers
placed
it
upon
a
bier
and
set
out
i
accompanied
the
cortege
only
to
the
end
of
the
street
here
the
driver
broke
into
a
trot
and
the
old
man
started
to
run
behind
the
hearse
sobbing
loudly
but
with
the
motion
of
his
running
ever
and
anon
causing
the
sobs
to
quaver
and
become
broken
off
next
he
lost
his
hat
the
poor
old
fellow
yet
would
not
stop
to
pick
it
up
even
though
the
rain
was
beating
upon
his
head
and
a
wind
was
rising
and
the
sleet
kept
stinging
and
lashing
his
face
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
impervious
to
the
cruel
elements
as
he
ran
from
one
side
of
the
hearse
to
the
other
the
skirts
of
his
old
greatcoat
flapping
about
him
like
a
pair
of
wings
from
every
pocket
of
the
garment
protruded
books
while
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
specially
large
volume
which
he
hugged
closely
to
his
breast
the
uncovered
their
heads
and
crossed
themselves
as
the
cortege
passed
and
some
of
them
having
done
so
remained
staring
in
amazement
at
the
poor
old
man
every
now
and
then
a
book
would
slip
from
one
of
his
pockets
and
fall
into
the
mud
whereupon
somebody
stopping
him
would
direct
his
attention
to
his
loss
and
he
would
stop
pick
up
the
book
and
again
set
off
in
pursuit
of
the
hearse
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
was
joined
by
a
ragged
old
woman
until
at
length
the
hearse
turned
a
corner
and
became
hidden
from
my
eyes
then
i
went
home
and
threw
myself
in
a
transport
of
grief
upon
my
mother
s
breast
clasping
her
in
my
arms
kissing
her
amid
a
storm
of
sobs
and
tears
and
clinging
to
her
form
as
though
in
my
embraces
i
were
holding
my
last
friend
on
earth
that
i
might
preserve
her
from
death
yet
already
death
was
standing
over
her
june
how
i
thank
you
for
our
walk
to
the
islands
yesterday
makar
alexievitch
how
fresh
and
pleasant
how
full
of
verdure
was
everything
and
i
had
not
seen
anything
green
for
such
a
long
time
during
my
illness
i
used
to
think
that
i
should
never
get
better
that
i
was
certainly
going
to
die
judge
then
how
i
felt
yesterday
true
i
may
have
seemed
to
you
a
little
sad
and
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
that
happy
and
though
i
was
there
were
moments
even
at
the
height
of
my
felicity
when
for
some
unknown
reason
depression
came
sweeping
over
my
soul
i
kept
weeping
about
trifles
yet
could
not
say
why
i
was
grieved
the
truth
is
that
i
am
unwell
so
much
so
that
i
look
at
everything
from
the
gloomy
point
of
view
the
pale
clear
sky
the
setting
sun
the
evening
stillness
ah
somehow
i
felt
disposed
to
grieve
and
feel
hurt
at
these
things
my
heart
seemed
to
be
and
to
be
calling
for
tears
to
relieve
it
but
why
should
i
write
this
to
you
it
is
difficult
for
my
heart
to
express
itself
still
more
difficult
for
it
to
forego
yet
possibly
you
may
understand
me
tears
and
laughter
how
good
you
are
makar
alexievitch
yesterday
you
looked
into
my
eyes
as
though
you
could
read
in
them
all
that
i
was
feeling
as
though
you
were
rejoicing
at
my
happiness
whether
it
were
a
group
of
shrubs
or
an
alleyway
or
a
vista
of
water
that
we
were
passing
you
would
halt
before
me
and
stand
gazing
at
my
face
as
though
you
were
showing
me
possessions
of
your
own
it
told
me
how
kind
is
your
nature
and
i
love
you
for
it
today
i
am
again
unwell
for
yesterday
i
wetted
my
feet
and
took
a
chill
thedora
also
is
unwell
both
of
us
are
ailing
do
not
forget
me
come
and
see
me
as
often
as
you
your
own
barbara
alexievna
june
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
i
had
supposed
that
you
meant
to
describe
our
doings
of
the
other
day
in
verse
yet
from
you
there
has
arrived
only
a
single
sheet
of
writing
nevertheless
i
must
say
that
little
though
you
have
put
into
your
letter
that
little
is
not
expressed
with
rare
beauty
and
grace
nature
your
descriptions
of
rural
scenes
your
analysis
of
your
own
feelings
the
whole
is
beautifully
written
alas
i
have
no
such
talent
though
i
may
fill
a
score
of
pages
nothing
comes
of
it
i
might
as
well
never
have
put
pen
to
paper
yes
this
i
know
from
experience
you
say
my
darling
that
i
am
kind
and
good
that
i
could
not
harm
my
that
i
have
power
to
comprehend
the
goodness
of
god
as
expressed
in
nature
s
handiwork
and
so
on
it
may
all
be
so
my
dearest
one
it
may
all
be
exactly
as
you
say
indeed
i
think
that
you
are
right
but
if
so
the
reason
is
that
when
one
reads
such
a
letter
as
you
have
just
sent
me
one
s
heart
involuntarily
softens
and
affords
entrance
to
thoughts
of
a
graver
and
weightier
order
listen
my
darling
i
have
something
to
tell
you
my
beloved
one
i
will
begin
from
the
time
when
i
was
seventeen
years
old
and
first
entered
the
service
though
i
shall
soon
have
completed
my
thirtieth
year
of
official
activity
i
may
say
that
at
first
i
was
much
pleased
with
my
new
uniform
and
as
i
grew
older
i
grew
in
mind
and
fell
to
studying
my
likewise
i
may
say
that
i
lived
an
upright
life
so
much
so
that
at
last
i
incurred
persecution
this
you
may
not
believe
but
it
is
true
to
think
that
men
so
cruel
should
exist
for
though
dearest
one
i
am
dull
and
of
no
account
i
have
feelings
like
everyone
else
consequently
would
you
believe
it
barbara
when
i
tell
you
what
these
cruel
fellows
did
to
me
i
feel
ashamed
to
tell
it
you
and
all
because
i
was
of
a
quiet
peaceful
disposition
things
began
with
this
or
that
makar
alexievitch
is
your
then
it
went
on
to
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
fault
is
wholly
makar
alexievitch
finally
it
became
of
course
makar
alexievitch
is
to
do
you
see
the
sequence
of
things
my
darling
every
mistake
was
attributed
to
me
until
makar
alexievitch
became
a
byword
in
our
department
also
while
making
of
me
a
proverb
these
fellows
could
not
give
me
a
smile
or
a
civil
word
they
found
fault
with
my
boots
with
my
uniform
with
my
hair
with
my
figure
none
of
these
things
were
to
their
taste
everything
had
to
be
changed
and
so
it
has
been
from
that
day
to
this
true
i
have
now
grown
used
to
it
for
i
can
grow
accustomed
to
anything
being
as
you
know
a
man
of
peaceable
disposition
like
all
men
of
small
stature
yet
why
should
these
things
be
whom
have
i
harmed
whom
have
i
ever
supplanted
whom
have
i
ever
traduced
to
his
superiors
no
the
fault
is
that
more
than
once
i
have
asked
for
an
increase
of
salary
but
have
i
ever
caballed
for
it
no
you
would
be
wrong
in
thinking
so
my
dearest
one
how
could
i
ever
have
done
so
you
yourself
have
had
many
opportunities
of
seeing
how
incapable
i
am
of
deceit
or
chicanery
why
then
should
this
have
fallen
to
my
lot
however
since
you
think
me
worthy
of
respect
my
darling
i
do
not
care
for
you
are
far
and
away
the
best
person
in
the
world
what
do
you
consider
to
be
the
greatest
social
virtue
in
private
conversation
evstafi
ivanovitch
once
told
me
that
the
greatest
social
virtue
might
be
considered
to
be
an
ability
to
get
money
to
spend
also
my
comrades
used
jestingly
yes
i
know
only
jestingly
to
propound
the
ethical
maxim
that
a
man
ought
never
to
let
himself
become
a
burden
upon
anyone
well
i
am
a
burden
upon
no
one
it
is
my
own
crust
of
bread
that
i
eat
and
though
that
crust
is
but
a
poor
one
and
sometimes
actually
a
maggoty
one
it
has
at
least
been
earned
and
therefore
is
being
put
to
a
right
and
lawful
use
what
therefore
ought
i
to
do
i
know
that
i
can
earn
but
little
by
my
labours
as
a
copyist
yet
even
of
that
little
i
am
proud
for
it
has
entailed
work
and
has
wrung
sweat
from
my
brow
what
harm
is
there
in
being
a
copyist
he
is
only
an
amanuensis
people
say
of
me
but
what
is
there
so
disgraceful
in
that
my
writing
is
at
least
legible
neat
and
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
his
excellency
is
satisfied
with
it
indeed
i
transcribe
many
important
documents
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
my
writing
lacks
style
which
is
why
i
have
never
risen
in
the
service
even
to
you
my
dear
one
i
write
simply
and
without
tricks
but
just
as
a
thought
may
happen
to
enter
my
head
yes
i
know
all
this
but
if
everyone
were
to
become
a
fine
writer
who
would
there
be
left
to
act
as
copyists
whatsoever
questions
i
may
put
to
you
in
my
letters
dearest
i
pray
you
to
answer
them
i
am
sure
that
you
need
me
that
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
and
since
that
is
so
i
must
not
allow
myself
to
be
distracted
by
any
trifle
even
if
i
be
likened
to
a
rat
i
do
not
care
provided
that
that
particular
rat
be
wanted
by
you
and
be
of
use
in
the
world
and
be
retained
in
its
position
and
receive
its
reward
but
what
a
rat
it
is
enough
of
this
dearest
one
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
of
it
but
i
lost
my
temper
still
it
is
pleasant
to
speak
the
truth
sometimes
goodbye
my
own
my
darling
my
sweet
little
comforter
i
will
come
to
you
soon
yes
i
will
certainly
come
to
you
until
i
do
so
do
not
fret
yourself
with
me
i
shall
be
bringing
a
book
once
more
your
heartfelt
makar
dievushkin
june
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
i
am
writing
to
you
i
am
hurrying
my
utmost
to
get
my
work
finished
in
time
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
reason
for
this
it
is
because
an
opportunity
has
occurred
for
you
to
make
a
splendid
purchase
thedora
tells
me
that
a
retired
civil
servant
of
her
acquaintance
has
a
uniform
to
sell
one
cut
to
regulation
pattern
and
in
good
repair
as
well
as
likely
to
go
very
cheap
now
do
not
tell
me
that
you
have
not
got
the
money
for
i
know
from
your
own
lips
that
you
have
use
that
money
i
pray
you
and
do
not
hoard
it
see
what
terrible
garments
you
walk
about
in
they
are
shameful
they
are
patched
all
over
in
fact
you
have
nothing
new
whatever
that
this
is
so
i
know
for
certain
and
i
care
not
what
you
tell
me
about
it
so
listen
to
me
for
once
and
buy
this
uniform
do
it
for
my
sake
do
it
to
show
that
you
really
love
me
you
have
sent
me
some
linen
as
a
gift
but
listen
to
me
makar
alexievitch
you
are
simply
ruining
yourself
is
it
a
jest
that
you
should
spend
so
much
money
such
a
terrible
amount
of
money
upon
me
how
you
love
to
play
the
spendthrift
i
tell
you
that
i
do
not
need
it
that
such
expenditure
is
unnecessary
i
know
i
am
certain
that
you
love
me
therefore
it
is
useless
to
remind
me
of
the
fact
with
gifts
nor
do
i
like
receiving
them
since
i
know
how
much
they
must
have
cost
you
no
put
your
money
to
a
better
use
i
beg
i
beseech
of
you
to
do
so
also
you
ask
me
to
send
you
a
continuation
of
my
memoirs
to
conclude
them
but
i
know
not
how
i
contrived
even
to
write
as
much
of
them
as
i
did
and
now
i
have
not
the
strength
to
write
further
of
my
past
nor
the
desire
to
give
it
a
single
thought
such
recollections
are
terrible
to
me
most
difficult
of
all
is
it
for
me
to
speak
of
my
poor
mother
who
left
her
destitute
daughter
a
prey
to
villains
my
heart
runs
blood
whenever
i
think
of
it
it
is
so
fresh
in
my
memory
that
i
can
not
dismiss
it
from
my
thoughts
nor
rest
for
its
insistence
although
a
year
has
now
elapsed
since
the
events
took
place
but
all
this
you
know
also
i
have
told
you
what
anna
thedorovna
is
now
intending
she
accuses
me
of
ingratitude
and
denies
the
accusations
made
against
herself
with
regard
to
monsieur
bwikov
also
she
keeps
sending
for
me
and
telling
me
that
i
have
taken
to
evil
courses
but
that
if
i
will
return
to
her
she
will
smooth
over
matters
with
bwikov
and
force
him
to
confess
his
fault
also
she
says
that
he
desires
to
give
me
a
dowry
away
with
them
all
i
am
quite
happy
here
with
you
and
good
thedora
whose
devotion
to
me
reminds
me
of
my
old
nurse
long
since
dead
distant
kinsman
though
you
may
be
i
pray
you
always
to
defend
my
honour
other
people
i
do
not
wish
to
know
and
would
gladly
forget
if
i
could
what
are
they
wanting
with
me
now
thedora
declares
it
all
to
be
a
trick
and
says
that
in
time
they
will
leave
me
alone
god
grant
it
be
so
june
my
own
my
darling
i
wish
to
write
to
you
yet
know
not
where
to
begin
things
are
as
strange
as
though
we
were
actually
living
together
also
i
would
add
that
never
in
my
life
have
i
passed
such
happy
days
as
i
am
spending
at
present
tis
as
though
god
had
blessed
me
with
a
home
and
a
family
of
my
own
yes
you
are
my
little
daughter
beloved
but
why
mention
the
four
sorry
roubles
that
i
sent
you
you
needed
them
i
know
that
from
thedora
herself
and
it
will
always
be
a
particular
pleasure
to
me
to
gratify
you
in
anything
it
will
always
be
my
one
happiness
in
life
pray
therefore
leave
me
that
happiness
and
do
not
seek
to
cross
me
in
it
things
are
not
as
you
suppose
i
have
now
reached
the
sunshine
since
in
the
first
place
i
am
living
so
close
to
you
as
almost
to
be
with
you
which
is
a
great
consolation
to
my
mind
while
in
the
second
place
a
neighbour
of
mine
named
rataziaev
the
retired
official
who
gives
the
literary
parties
has
today
invited
me
to
tea
this
evening
therefore
there
will
be
a
gathering
at
which
we
shall
discuss
literature
think
of
that
my
darling
well
goodbye
now
i
have
written
this
without
any
definite
aim
in
my
mind
but
solely
to
assure
you
of
my
welfare
through
theresa
i
have
received
your
message
that
you
need
an
embroidered
cloak
to
wear
so
i
will
go
and
purchase
one
yes
tomorrow
i
mean
to
purchase
that
embroidered
cloak
and
so
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
having
satisfied
one
of
your
wants
i
know
where
to
go
for
such
a
garment
for
the
time
being
i
remain
your
sincere
friend
makar
dievushkin
june
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
i
have
to
tell
you
that
a
sad
event
has
happened
in
this
house
an
event
to
excite
one
s
utmost
pity
this
morning
about
five
o
clock
one
of
gorshkov
s
children
died
of
scarlatina
or
something
of
the
kind
i
have
been
to
pay
the
parents
a
visit
of
condolence
and
found
them
living
in
the
direst
poverty
and
disorder
nor
is
that
surprising
seeing
that
the
family
lives
in
a
single
room
with
only
a
screen
to
divide
it
for
decency
s
sake
already
the
coffin
was
standing
in
their
midst
a
plain
but
decent
shell
which
had
been
bought
the
child
they
told
me
had
been
a
boy
of
nine
and
full
of
promise
what
a
pitiful
spectacle
though
not
weeping
the
mother
poor
woman
looked
broken
with
grief
after
all
to
have
one
burden
the
less
on
their
shoulders
may
prove
a
relief
though
there
are
still
two
children
left
a
babe
at
the
breast
and
a
little
girl
of
six
how
painful
to
see
these
suffering
children
and
to
be
unable
to
help
them
the
father
clad
in
an
old
dirty
frockcoat
was
seated
on
a
dilapidated
chair
down
his
cheeks
there
were
coursing
tears
though
less
through
grief
than
owing
to
a
affliction
of
the
eyes
he
was
so
thin
too
always
he
reddens
in
the
face
when
he
is
addressed
and
becomes
too
confused
to
answer
a
little
girl
his
daughter
was
leaning
against
the
coffin
her
face
looking
so
worn
and
thoughtful
poor
mite
do
you
know
i
can
not
bear
to
see
a
child
look
thoughtful
on
the
floor
there
lay
a
rag
doll
but
she
was
not
playing
with
it
as
motionless
she
stood
there
with
her
finger
to
her
lips
even
a
which
the
landlady
had
given
her
she
was
not
eating
is
it
not
all
sad
sad
barbara
makar
dievushkin
june
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
i
return
you
your
book
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
worthless
one
and
i
would
rather
not
have
it
in
my
possession
why
do
you
save
up
your
money
to
buy
such
trash
except
in
jest
do
such
books
really
please
you
however
you
have
now
promised
to
send
me
something
else
to
read
i
will
share
the
cost
of
it
now
farewell
until
we
meet
again
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
june
my
dear
little
barbara
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
myself
have
not
read
the
book
of
which
you
speak
that
is
to
say
though
i
began
to
read
it
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
nonsense
and
written
only
to
make
people
laugh
however
thought
i
it
is
at
least
a
cheerful
work
and
so
may
please
that
is
why
i
sent
it
you
rataziaev
has
now
promised
to
give
me
something
really
literary
to
read
so
you
shall
soon
have
your
book
my
darling
he
is
a
man
who
reflects
he
is
a
clever
fellow
as
well
as
himself
a
writer
such
a
writer
his
pen
glides
along
with
ease
and
in
such
a
style
even
when
he
is
writing
the
most
ordinary
the
most
insignificant
of
articles
that
i
have
often
remarked
upon
the
fact
both
to
phaldoni
and
to
theresa
often
too
i
go
to
spend
an
evening
with
him
he
reads
aloud
to
us
until
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
we
listen
to
him
it
is
a
revelation
of
things
rather
than
a
reading
it
is
charming
it
is
like
a
bouquet
of
flowers
there
is
a
bouquet
of
flowers
in
every
line
of
each
page
besides
he
is
such
an
approachable
courteous
fellow
what
am
i
compared
with
him
why
nothing
simply
nothing
he
is
a
man
of
reputation
whereas
i
well
i
do
not
exist
at
all
yet
he
condescends
to
my
level
at
this
very
moment
i
am
copying
out
a
document
for
him
but
you
must
not
think
that
he
finds
any
difficulty
in
condescending
to
me
who
am
only
a
copyist
no
you
must
not
believe
the
base
gossip
that
you
may
hear
i
do
copying
work
for
him
simply
in
order
to
please
myself
as
well
as
that
he
may
notice
me
a
thing
that
always
gives
me
pleasure
i
appreciate
the
delicacy
of
his
position
he
is
a
good
a
very
good
man
and
an
unapproachable
writer
what
a
splendid
thing
is
literature
barbara
what
a
splendid
thing
this
i
learnt
before
i
had
known
rataziaev
even
for
three
days
it
strengthens
and
instructs
the
heart
of
man
no
matter
what
there
be
in
the
world
you
will
find
it
all
written
down
in
rataziaev
s
works
and
so
well
written
down
too
literature
is
a
sort
of
picture
a
sort
of
picture
or
mirror
it
connotes
at
once
passion
expression
fine
criticism
good
learning
and
a
document
yes
i
have
learned
this
from
rataziaev
himself
i
can
assure
you
barbara
that
if
only
you
could
be
sitting
among
us
and
listening
to
the
talk
while
with
the
rest
of
us
you
smoked
a
pipe
and
were
to
hear
those
present
begin
to
argue
and
dispute
concerning
different
matters
you
would
feel
of
as
little
account
among
them
as
i
do
for
i
myself
figure
there
only
as
a
blockhead
and
feel
ashamed
since
it
takes
me
a
whole
evening
to
think
of
a
single
word
to
interpolate
and
even
then
the
word
will
not
come
in
a
case
like
that
a
man
regrets
that
as
the
proverb
has
it
he
should
have
reached
man
s
estate
but
not
man
s
understanding
what
do
i
do
in
my
spare
time
i
sleep
like
a
fool
though
i
would
far
rather
be
occupied
with
something
else
say
with
eating
or
writing
since
the
one
is
useful
to
oneself
and
the
other
is
beneficial
to
one
s
fellows
you
should
see
how
much
money
these
fellows
contrive
to
save
how
much
for
instance
does
not
rataziaev
lay
by
a
few
days
writing
i
am
told
can
earn
him
as
much
as
three
hundred
roubles
indeed
if
a
man
be
a
writer
of
short
stories
or
anything
else
that
is
interesting
he
can
sometimes
pocket
five
hundred
roubles
or
a
thousand
at
a
time
think
of
it
barbara
rataziaev
has
by
him
a
small
manuscript
of
verses
and
for
it
he
is
asking
what
do
you
think
seven
thousand
roubles
why
one
could
buy
a
whole
house
for
that
sum
he
has
even
refused
five
thousand
for
a
manuscript
and
on
that
occasion
i
reasoned
with
him
and
advised
him
to
accept
the
five
thousand
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
said
he
they
will
soon
offer
me
seven
thousand
and
kept
to
his
point
for
he
is
a
man
of
some
determination
suppose
now
that
i
were
to
give
you
an
extract
from
passion
in
italy
as
another
work
of
his
is
called
read
this
dearest
barbara
and
judge
for
yourself
vladimir
started
for
in
his
veins
the
lust
of
passion
had
welled
until
it
had
reached
boiling
point
countess
he
cried
do
you
know
how
terrible
is
this
adoration
of
mine
how
infinite
this
madness
no
my
fancies
have
not
deceived
me
i
love
you
ecstatically
diabolically
as
a
madman
might
all
the
blood
that
is
in
your
husband
s
body
could
never
quench
the
furious
surging
rapture
that
is
in
my
soul
no
puny
obstacle
could
thwart
the
infernal
flame
which
is
eating
into
my
exhausted
breast
oh
zinaida
my
zinaida
vladimir
she
whispered
almost
beside
herself
as
she
sank
upon
his
bosom
my
zinaida
cried
the
enraptured
smileski
once
more
his
breath
was
coming
in
sharp
broken
pants
the
lamp
of
love
was
burning
brightly
on
the
altar
of
passion
and
searing
the
hearts
of
the
two
unfortunate
sufferers
vladimir
again
she
whispered
in
her
intoxication
while
her
bosom
heaved
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
flashed
fire
thus
was
a
new
and
dread
union
consummated
half
an
hour
later
the
aged
count
entered
his
wife
s
boudoir
how
now
my
love
said
he
surely
it
is
for
some
welcome
guest
beyond
the
common
that
you
have
had
the
samovar
thus
prepared
and
he
smote
her
lightly
on
the
what
think
you
of
that
barbara
true
it
is
a
little
too
outspoken
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
yet
how
grand
it
is
how
splendid
with
your
permission
i
will
also
quote
you
an
extract
from
rataziaev
s
story
ermak
and
zuleika
you
love
me
zuleika
say
again
that
you
love
me
you
love
me
i
do
love
you
ermak
whispered
zuleika
then
by
heaven
and
earth
i
thank
you
by
heaven
and
earth
you
have
made
me
happy
you
have
given
me
all
all
that
my
tortured
soul
has
for
immemorial
years
been
seeking
tis
for
this
that
you
have
led
me
hither
my
guiding
star
tis
for
this
that
you
have
conducted
me
to
the
girdle
of
stone
to
all
the
world
will
i
now
show
my
zuleika
and
no
man
demon
or
monster
of
hell
shall
bid
me
nay
oh
if
men
would
but
understand
the
mysterious
passions
of
her
tender
heart
and
see
the
poem
which
lurks
in
each
of
her
little
tears
suffer
me
to
dry
those
tears
with
my
kisses
suffer
me
to
drink
of
those
heavenly
drops
oh
being
who
art
not
of
this
earth
ermak
said
zuleika
the
world
is
cruel
and
men
are
unjust
but
let
them
drive
us
from
their
midst
let
them
judge
us
my
beloved
ermak
what
has
a
poor
maiden
who
was
reared
amid
the
snows
of
siberia
to
do
with
their
cold
icy
world
men
can
not
understand
me
my
darling
my
is
that
so
then
shall
the
sword
of
the
cossacks
sing
and
whistle
over
their
heads
cried
ermak
with
a
furious
look
in
his
what
must
ermak
have
felt
when
he
learnt
that
his
zuleika
had
been
murdered
barbara
that
taking
advantages
of
the
cover
of
night
the
blind
old
kouchoum
had
in
ermak
s
absence
broken
into
the
latter
s
tent
and
stabbed
his
own
daughter
in
mistake
for
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
sceptre
and
crown
oh
that
i
had
a
stone
whereon
to
whet
my
sword
cried
ermak
in
the
madness
of
his
wrath
as
he
strove
to
sharpen
his
steel
blade
upon
the
enchanted
rock
i
would
have
his
blood
his
blood
i
would
tear
him
limb
from
limb
the
villain
then
ermak
unable
to
survive
the
loss
of
his
zuleika
throws
himself
into
the
irtisch
and
the
tale
comes
to
an
end
here
again
is
another
short
extract
this
time
written
in
a
more
comical
vein
to
make
people
laugh
do
you
know
ivan
prokofievitch
zheltopuzh
he
is
the
man
who
took
a
piece
out
of
prokofi
ivanovitch
s
leg
ivan
s
character
is
one
of
the
rugged
order
and
therefore
one
that
is
rather
lacking
in
virtue
yet
he
has
a
passionate
relish
for
radishes
and
honey
once
he
also
possessed
a
friend
named
pelagea
antonovna
do
you
know
pelagea
antonovna
she
is
the
woman
who
always
puts
on
her
petticoat
wrong
side
what
humour
barbara
what
purest
humour
we
rocked
with
laughter
when
he
read
it
aloud
to
us
yes
that
is
the
kind
of
man
he
is
possibly
the
passage
is
a
trifle
but
at
least
it
is
harmless
and
contains
no
freethought
or
liberal
ideas
in
passing
i
may
say
that
rataziaev
is
not
only
a
supreme
writer
but
also
a
man
of
upright
life
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
most
writers
what
do
you
think
is
an
idea
that
sometimes
enters
my
head
in
fact
what
if
i
myself
were
to
write
something
how
if
suddenly
a
book
were
to
make
its
appearance
in
the
world
bearing
the
title
of
the
poetical
works
of
makar
dievushkin
what
then
my
angel
how
should
you
view
should
you
receive
such
an
event
i
may
say
of
myself
that
never
after
my
book
had
appeared
should
i
have
the
hardihood
to
show
my
face
on
the
nevski
prospect
for
would
it
not
be
too
dreadful
to
hear
every
one
saying
here
comes
the
literateur
and
poet
dievushkin
yes
it
is
dievushkin
what
in
such
a
case
should
i
do
with
my
feet
for
i
may
tell
you
that
almost
always
my
shoes
are
patched
or
have
just
been
resoled
and
therefore
look
anything
but
becoming
to
think
that
the
great
writer
dievushkin
should
walk
about
in
patched
footgear
if
a
duchess
or
a
countess
should
recognise
me
what
would
she
say
poor
woman
perhaps
though
she
would
not
notice
my
shoes
at
all
since
it
may
reasonably
be
supposed
that
countesses
do
not
greatly
occupy
themselves
with
footgear
especially
with
the
footgear
of
civil
service
officials
footgear
may
differ
from
footgear
it
must
be
remembered
besides
i
should
find
that
the
countess
had
heard
all
about
me
for
my
friends
would
have
betrayed
me
to
her
rataziaev
among
the
first
of
them
seeing
that
he
often
goes
to
visit
countess
and
practically
lives
at
her
house
she
is
said
to
be
a
woman
of
great
intellect
and
wit
an
artful
dog
that
rataziaev
but
enough
of
this
i
write
this
sort
of
thing
both
to
amuse
myself
and
to
divert
your
thoughts
goodbye
now
my
angel
this
is
a
long
epistle
that
i
am
sending
you
but
the
reason
is
that
today
i
feel
in
good
spirits
after
dining
at
rataziaev
s
there
i
came
across
a
novel
which
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
to
you
do
not
think
the
worse
of
me
on
that
account
even
though
i
bring
you
another
book
instead
for
i
certainly
mean
to
bring
one
the
novel
in
question
was
one
of
paul
de
kock
s
and
not
a
novel
for
you
to
read
no
no
such
a
work
is
unfit
for
your
eyes
in
fact
it
is
said
to
have
greatly
offended
the
critics
of
petersburg
also
i
am
sending
you
a
pound
of
bonbons
bought
specially
for
yourself
each
time
that
you
eat
one
beloved
remember
the
sender
only
do
not
bite
the
iced
ones
but
suck
them
gently
lest
they
make
your
teeth
ache
perhaps
too
you
like
comfits
well
write
and
tell
me
if
it
is
so
goodbye
goodbye
christ
watch
over
you
my
darling
always
your
faithful
friend
makar
dievushkin
june
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
thedora
tells
me
that
should
i
wish
there
are
some
people
who
will
be
glad
to
help
me
by
obtaining
me
an
excellent
post
as
governess
in
a
certain
house
what
think
you
my
friend
shall
i
go
or
not
of
course
i
should
then
cease
to
be
a
burden
to
you
and
the
post
appears
to
be
a
comfortable
one
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
of
entering
a
strange
house
appals
me
the
people
in
it
are
landed
gentry
and
they
will
begin
to
ask
me
questions
and
to
busy
themselves
about
me
what
answers
shall
i
then
return
you
see
i
am
now
so
unused
to
society
so
shy
i
like
to
live
in
a
corner
to
which
i
have
long
grown
used
yes
the
place
with
which
one
is
familiar
is
always
the
best
even
if
for
companion
one
has
but
sorrow
that
place
will
still
be
the
best
god
alone
knows
what
duties
the
post
will
entail
perhaps
i
shall
merely
be
required
to
act
as
nursemaid
and
in
any
case
i
hear
that
the
governess
there
has
been
changed
three
times
in
two
years
for
god
s
sake
makar
alexievitch
advise
me
whether
to
go
or
not
why
do
you
never
come
near
me
now
do
let
my
eyes
have
an
occasional
sight
of
you
mass
on
sundays
is
almost
the
only
time
when
we
see
one
another
how
retiring
you
have
become
so
also
have
i
even
though
in
a
way
i
am
your
kinswoman
you
must
have
ceased
to
love
me
makar
alexievitch
i
spend
many
a
weary
hour
because
of
it
sometimes
when
dusk
is
falling
i
find
myself
lonely
oh
so
lonely
thedora
has
gone
out
somewhere
and
i
sit
here
and
think
and
think
and
think
i
remember
all
the
past
its
joys
and
its
sorrows
it
passes
before
my
eyes
in
detail
it
glimmers
at
me
as
out
of
a
mist
and
as
it
does
so
faces
appear
which
seem
actually
to
be
present
with
me
in
this
room
most
frequently
of
all
i
see
my
mother
ah
the
dreams
that
come
to
me
i
feel
that
my
health
is
breaking
so
weak

i
when
this
morning
i
arose
sickness
took
me
until
i
vomited
and

know
that
death
is
approaching
who
will
bury
me
when
it
has
come
who
will
visit
my
tomb
who
will
sorrow
for
me
and
now
it
is
in
a
strange
place
in
the
house
of
a
stranger
that
i
may
have
to
die
yes
in
a
corner
which
i
do
not

my
god

sad
a
thing

for
it
which
is
very
good
i
had
expected
less
of
the
fifty
roubles
i
shall
give
thedora
three
and
with
the
remainder
make
myself
a
plain
warm
dress
also
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
waistcoat
to
make
it
myself
and
out
of
good
material
also
thedora
has
brought
me
a
book
the
stories
of
bielkin
which
i
will
forward
you
if
you
would
care
to
read
it
only
do
not
soil
it
nor
yet
retain
it
for
it
does
not
belong
to
me
it
is
by
pushkin
two
years
ago
i
read
these
stories
with
my
mother
and
it
would
hurt
me
to
read
them
again
if
you
yourself
have
any
books
pray
let
me
have
them
so
long
as
they
have
not
been
obtained
from
rataziaev
probably
he
will
be
giving
you
one
of
his
own
works
when
he
has
had
one
printed
how
is
it
that
his
compositions
please
you
so
much
makar
alexievitch
i
think
them
such
rubbish
now
goodbye
how
i
have
been
chattering
on
when
feeling
sad
i
always
like
to
talk
of
something
for
it
acts
upon
me
like
medicine
i
begin
to
feel
easier
as
soon
as
i
have
uttered
what
is
preying
upon
my
heart
good
bye
my
friend
your
own
june
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
away
with
melancholy
really
beloved
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
how
can
you
allow
such
thoughts
to
enter
your
head
really
and
truly
you
are
quite
well
really
and
truly
you
are
my
darling
why
you
are
blooming
simply
blooming
true
i
see
a
certain
touch
of
pallor
in
your
face
but
still
you
are
blooming
a
fig
for
dreams
and
visions
yes
for
shame
dearest
drive
away
those
fancies
try
to
despise
them
why
do
i
sleep
so
well
why
am
i
never
ailing
look
at
me
beloved
i
live
well
i
sleep
peacefully
i
retain
my
health
i
can
ruffle
it
with
my
juniors
in
fact
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
me
come
come
then
sweetheart
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
i
know
that
that
little
head
of
yours
is
capable
of
any
fancy
that
all
too
easily
you
take
to
dreaming
and
repining
but
for
my
sake
cease
to
do
so
are
you
to
go
to
these
people
you
ask
me
never
no
no
again
no
how
could
you
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
as
taking
a
journey
i
will
not
allow
it
i
intend
to
combat
your
intention
with
all
my
might
i
will
sell
my
frockcoat
and
walk
the
streets
in
my
shirt
sleeves
rather
than
let
you
be
in
want
but
no
barbara
i
know
you
i
know
you
this
is
merely
a
trick
merely
a
trick
and
probably
thedora
alone
is
to
blame
for
it
she
appears
to
be
a
foolish
old
woman
and
to
be
able
to
persuade
you
to
do
anything
do
not
believe
her
my
dearest
i
am
sure
that
you
know
what
is
what
as
well
as
she
does
eh
sweetheart
she
is
a
stupid
quarrelsome
old
woman
who
brought
her
late
husband
to
the
grave
probably
she
has
been
plaguing
you
as
much
as
she
did
him
no
no
dearest
you
must
not
take
this
step
what
should
i
do
then
what
would
there
be
left
for
me
to
do
pray
put
the
idea
out
of
your
head
what
is
it
you
lack
here
i
can
not
feel
sufficiently
overjoyed
to
be
near
you
while
for
your
part
you
love
me
well
and
can
live
your
life
here
as
quietly
as
you
wish
read
or
sew
whichever
you
like
or
read
and
do
not
sew
only
do
not
desert
me
try
yourself
to
imagine
how
things
would
seem
after
you
had
gone
here
am
i
sending
you
books
and
later
we
will
go
for
a
walk
come
come
then
my
barbara
summon
to
your
aid
your
reason
and
cease
to
babble
of
trifles
as
soon
as
i
can
i
will
come
and
see
you
and
then
you
shall
tell
me
the
whole
story
this
will
not
do
sweetheart
this
certainly
will
not
do
of
course
i
know
that
i
am
not
an
educated
man
and
have
received
but
a
sorry
schooling
and
have
had
no
inclination
for
it
and
think
too
much
of
rataziaev
if
you
will
but
he
is
my
friend
and
therefore
i
must
put
in
a
word
or
two
for
him
yes
he
is
a
splendid
writer
again
and
again
i
assert
that
he
writes
magnificently
i
do
not
agree
with
you
about
his
works
and
never
shall
he
writes
too
ornately
too
laconically
with
too
great
a
wealth
of
imagery
and
imagination
perhaps
you
have
read
him
without
insight
barbara
or
perhaps
you
were
out
of
spirits
at
the
time
or
angry
with
thedora
about
something
or
worried
about
some
mischance
ah
but
you
should
read
him
sympathetically
and
best
of
all
at
a
time
when
you
are
feeling
happy
and
contented
and
pleasantly
disposed
for
instance
when
you
have
a
bonbon
or
two
in
your
mouth
yes
that
is
the
way
to
read
rataziaev
i
do
not
dispute
indeed
who
would
do
so
that
better
writers
than
he
exist
even
far
better
but
they
are
good
and
he
is
good
too
they
write
well
and
he
writes
well
it
is
chiefly
for
his
own
sake
that
he
writes
and
he
is
to
be
approved
for
so
doing
now
goodbye
dearest
more
i
can
not
write
for
i
must
hurry
away
to
business
be
of
good
cheer
and
the
lord
god
watch
over
you
your
faithful
friend
makar
dievushkin
thank
you
so
much
for
the
book
darling
i
will
read
it
through
this
volume
of
pushkin
and
tonight
come
to
you
my
dear
makar
alexievitch
no
no
my
friend
i
must
not
go
on
living
near
you
i
have
been
thinking
the
matter
over
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
be
doing
very
wrong
to
refuse
so
good
a
post
i
should
at
least
have
an
assured
crust
of
bread
i
might
at
least
set
to
work
to
earn
my
employers
favour
and
even
try
to
change
my
character
if
required
to
do
so
of
course
it
is
a
sad
and
sorry
thing
to
have
to
live
among
strangers
and
to
be
forced
to
seek
their
patronage
and
to
conceal
and
constrain
one
s
own
personality
but
god
will
help
me
i
must
not
remain
forever
a
recluse
for
similar
chances
have
come
my
way
before
i
remember
how
when
a
little
girl
at
school
i
used
to
go
home
on
sundays
and
spend
the
time
in
frisking
and
dancing
about
sometimes
my
mother
would
chide
me
for
so
doing
but
i
did
not
care
for
my
heart
was
too
joyous
and
my
spirits
too
buoyant
for
that
yet
as
the
evening
of
sunday
came
on
a
sadness
as
of
death
would
overtake
me
for
at
nine
o
clock
i
had
to
return
to
school
where
everything
was
cold
and
strange
and
severe
where
the
governesses
on
mondays
lost
their
tempers
and
nipped
my
ears
and
made
me
cry
on
such
occasions
i
would
retire
to
a
corner
and
weep
alone
concealing
my
tears
lest
i
should
be
called
lazy
yet
it
was
not
because
i
had
to
study
that
i
used
to
weep
and
in
time
i
grew
more
used
to
things
and
after
my
schooldays
were
over
shed
tears
only
when
i
was
parting
with
friends
it
is
not
right
for
me
to
live
in
dependence
upon
you
the
thought
tortures
me
i
tell
you
this
frankly
for
the
reason
that
frankness
with
you
has
become
a
habit
can
not
i
see
that
daily
at
earliest
dawn
thedora
rises
to
do
washing
and
scrubbing
and
remains
working
at
it
until
late
at
night
even
though
her
poor
old
bones
must
be
aching
for
want
of
rest
can
not
i
also
see
that
you
are
ruining
yourself
for
me
and
hoarding
your
last
kopeck
that
you
may
spend
it
on
my
behalf
you
ought
not
so
to
act
my
friend
even
though
you
write
that
you
would
rather
sell
your
all
than
let
me
want
for
anything
i
believe
in
you
my
friend
i
entirely
believe
in
your
good
heart
but
you
say
that
to
me
now
when
perhaps
you
have
received
some
unexpected
sum
or
gratuity
and
there
is
still
the
future
to
be
thought
of
you
yourself
know
that
i
am
always
ailing
that
i
can
not
work
as
you
do
glad
though
i
should
be
of
any
work
if
i
could
get
it
so
what
else
is
there
for
me
to
do
to
sit
and
repine
as
i
watch
you
and
thedora
but
how
would
that
be
of
any
use
to
you
am
i
necessary
to
you
comrade
of
mine
have
i
ever
done
you
any
good
though
i
am
bound
to
you
with
my
whole
soul
and
love
you
dearly
and
strongly
and
wholeheartedly
a
bitter
fate
has
ordained
that
that
love
should
be
all
that
i
have
to
give
that
i
should
be
unable
by
creating
for
you
subsistence
to
repay
you
for
all
your
kindness
do
not
therefore
detain
me
longer
but
think
the
matter
out
and
give
me
your
opinion
on
it
in
expectation
of
which
i
remain
your
sweetheart
july
rubbish
rubbish
barbara
what
you
say
is
sheer
rubbish
stay
here
rather
and
put
such
thoughts
out
of
your
head
none
of
what
you
suppose
is
true
i
can
see
for
myself
that
it
is
not
whatsoever
you
lack
here
you
have
but
to
ask
me
for
it
here
you
love
and
are
loved
and
we
might
easily
be
happy
and
contented
together
what
could
you
want
more
what
have
you
to
do
with
strangers
you
can
not
possibly
know
what
strangers
are
like
i
know
it
though
and
could
have
told
you
if
you
had
asked
me
there
is
a
stranger
whom
i
know
and
whose
bread
i
have
eaten
he
is
a
cruel
man
barbara
a
man
so
bad
that
he
would
be
unworthy
of
your
little
heart
and
would
soon
tear
it
to
pieces
with
his
railings
and
reproaches
and
black
looks
on
the
other
hand
you
are
safe
and
well
here
you
are
as
safe
as
though
you
were
sheltered
in
a
nest
besides
you
would
as
it
were
leave
me
with
my
head
gone
for
what
should
i
have
to
do
when
you
were
gone
what
could
i
an
old
man
find
to
do
are
you
not
necessary
to
me
are
you
not
useful
to
me
eh
surely
you
do
not
think
that
you
are
not
useful
you
are
of
great
use
to
me
barbara
for
you
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
upon
my
life
even
at
this
moment
as
i
think
of
you
i
feel
cheered
for
always
i
can
write
letters
to
you
and
put
into
them
what
i
am
feeling
and
receive
from
you
detailed
answers
i
have
bought
you
a
wardrobe
and
also
procured
you
a
bonnet
so
you
see
that
you
have
only
to
give
me
a
commission
for
it
to
be
executed
no
in
what
way
are
you
not
useful
what
should
i
do
if
i
were
deserted
in
my
old
age
what
would
become
of
me
perhaps
you
never
thought
of
that
barbara
perhaps
you
never
said
to
yourself
how
could
he
get
on
without
me
you
see
i
have
grown
so
accustomed
to
you
what
else
would
it
end
in
if
you
were
to
go
away
why
in
my
hiking
to
the
neva
s
bank
and
doing
away
with
myself
ah
barbara
darling
i
can
see
that
you
want
me
to
be
taken
away
to
the
volkovo
cemetery
in
a
old
hearse
with
some
poor
outcast
of
the
streets
to
accompany
my
coffin
as
chief
mourner
and
the
gravediggers
to
heap
my
body
with
clay
and
depart
and
leave
me
there
how
wrong
of
you
how
wrong
of
you
my
beloved
yes
by
heavens
how
wrong
of
you
i
am
returning
you
your
book
little
friend
and
if
you
were
to
ask
of
me
my
opinion
of
it
i
should
say
that
never
before
in
my
life
had
i
read
a
book
so
splendid
i
keep
wondering
how
i
have
hitherto
contrived
to
remain
such
an
owl
for
what
have
i
ever
done
from
what
wilds
did
i
spring
into
existence
i
know
nothing
i
know
simply
nothing
my
ignorance
is
complete
frankly
i
am
not
an
educated
man
for
until
now
i
have
read
scarcely
a
single
book
only
a
portrait
of
man
a
clever
enough
work
in
its
way
the
boy
who
could
play
many
tunes
upon
bells
and
ivik
s
storks
that
is
all
but
now
i
have
also
read
the
station
overseer
in
your
little
volume
and
it
is
wonderful
to
think
that
one
may
live
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
under
one
s
very
nose
there
may
be
a
book
in
which
one
s
whole
life
is
described
as
in
a
picture
never
should
i
have
guessed
that
as
soon
as
ever
one
begins
to
read
such
a
book
it
sets
one
on
both
to
remember
and
to
consider
and
to
foretell
events
another
reason
why
i
liked
this
book
so
much
is
that
though
in
the
case
of
other
works
however
clever
they
be
one
may
read
them
yet
remember
not
a
word
of
them
for
i
am
a
man
naturally
dull
of
comprehension
and
unable
to
read
works
of
any
great
importance
although
as
i
say
one
may
read
such
works
one
reads
such
a
book
as
yours
as
easily
as
though
it
had
been
written
by
oneself
and
had
taken
possession
of
one
s
heart
and
turned
it
inside
out
for
inspection
and
were
describing
it
in
detail
as
a
matter
of
perfect
simplicity
why
i
might
almost
have
written
the
book
myself
why
not
indeed
i
can
feel
just
as
the
people
in
the
book
do
and
find
myself
in
positions
precisely
similar
to
those
of
say
the
character
samson
virin
in
fact
how
many
wretches
like
virin
are
there
not
walking
about
amongst
us
how
easily
too
it
is
all
described
i
assure
you
my
darling
that
i
almost
shed
tears
when
i
read
that
virin
so
took
to
drink
as
to
lose
his
memory
become
morose
and
spend
whole
days
over
his
liquor
as
also
that
he
choked
with
grief
and
wept
bitterly
when
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
dirty
hand
he
bethought
him
of
his
wandering
lamb
his
daughter
dunasha
how
natural
how
natural
you
should
read
the
book
for
yourself
the
thing
is
actually
alive
even
i
can
see
that
even
i
can
realise
that
it
is
a
picture
cut
from
the
very
life
around
me
in
it
i
see
our
own
theresa
to
go
no
further
and
the
poor
tchinovnik
who
is
just
such
a
man
as
this
samson
virin
except
for
his
surname
of
gorshkov
the
book
describes
just
what
might
happen
to
ourselves
to
myself
in
particular
even
a
count
who
lives
in
the
nevski
prospect
or
in
naberezhnaia
street
might
have
a
similar
experience
though
he
might
appear
to
be
different
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
life
is
cast
on
a
higher
plane
yes
just
the
same
things
might
happen
to
him
just
the
same
things
here
you
are
wishing
to
go
away
and
leave
us
yet
be
careful
lest
it
would
not
be
i
who
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
your
doing
so
for
you
might
ruin
both
yourself
and
me
for
the
love
of
god
put
away
these
thoughts
from
you
my
darling
and
do
not
torture
me
in
vain
how
could
you
my
poor
little
unfledged
nestling
find
yourself
food
and
defend
yourself
from
misfortune
and
ward
off
the
wiles
of
evil
men
think
better
of
it
barbara
and
pay
no
more
heed
to
foolish
advice
and
calumny
but
read
your
book
again
and
read
it
with
attention
it
may
do
you
much
good
i
have
spoken
of
rataziaev
s
the
station
overseer
however
the
author
has
told
me
that
the
work
is
since
nowadays
books
are
issued
with
illustrations
and
embellishments
of
different
sorts
though
i
could
not
make
out
all
that
he
said
pushkin

adjudges
a
splendid
poet
and
one
who
has
done
honour
to
holy
russia

book

follow
my
advice
and
make
an
old
man
happy
the
lord
god
himself
will
reward
you
yes
he
will
surely
reward
your
faithful
friend
makar
dievushkin
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
today
thedora
came
to
me
with
fifteen
roubles
in
silver
how
glad
was
the
poor
woman
when
i
gave
her
three
of
them
i
am
writing
to
you
in
great
haste
for
i
am
busy
cutting
out
a
waistcoat
to
send
to
you
buff
with
a
pattern
of
flowers
also
i
am
sending
you
a
book
of
stories
some
of
which
i
have
read
myself
particularly
one
called
the
you
invite
me
to
go
to
the
theatre
with
you
but
will
it
not
cost
too
much
of
course
we
might
sit
in
the
gallery
it
is
a
long
time
indeed
i
can
not
remember
when
i
last
did
so
since
i
visited
a
theatre
yet
i
can
not
help
fearing
that
such
an
amusement
is
beyond
our
means
thedora
keeps
nodding
her
head
and
saying
that
you
have
taken
to
living
above
your
income
i
myself
divine
the
same
thing
by
the
amount
which
you
have
spent
upon
me
take
care
dear
friend
that
misfortune
does
not
come
of
it
for
thedora
has
also
informed
me
of
certain
rumours
concerning
your
inability
to
meet
your
landlady
s
bills
in
fact
i
am
very
anxious
about
you
now
goodbye
for
i
must
hasten
away
to
see
about
another
matter
about
the
changing
of
the
ribands
on
my
bonnet
do
you
know
if
we
go
to
the
theatre
i
think
that
i
shall
wear
my
new
hat
and
black
mantilla
will
that
not
look
nice
july
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
so
much
for
yesterday
yes
dearest
we
have
both
been
caught
playing
the
fool
for
i
have
become
thoroughly
bitten
with
the
actress
of
whom
i
spoke
last
night
i
listened
to
her
with
all
my
ears
although
strangely
enough
it
was
practically
my
first
sight
of
her
seeing
that
only
once
before
had
i
been
to
the
theatre
in
those
days
i
lived
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
party
of
five
young
men
a
most
noisy
crew
and
one
night
i
accompanied
them
to
the
theatre
though
i
held
myself
decently
aloof
from
their
doings
and
only
assisted
them
for
company
s
sake
how
those
fellows
talked
to
me
of
this
actress
every
night
when
the
theatre
was
open
the
entire
band
of
them
they
always
seemed
to
possess
the
requisite
money
would
betake
themselves
to
that
place
of
entertainment
where
they
ascended
to
the
gallery
and
clapped
their
hands
and
repeatedly
recalled
the
actress
in
question
in
fact
they
went
simply
mad
over
her
even
after
we
had
returned
home
they
would
give
me
no
rest
but
would
go
on
talking
about
her
all
night
and
calling
her
their
glasha
and
declaring
themselves
to
be
in
love
with
the
of
their
my
defenseless
self
too
they
would
plague
about
the
woman
for
i
was
as
young
as
they
what
a
figure
i
must
have
cut
with
them
on
the
fourth
tier
of
the
gallery
yet
i
never
got
a
sight
of
more
than
just
a
corner
of
the
curtain
but
had
to
content
myself
with
listening
she
had
a
fine
resounding
mellow
voice
like
a
nightingale
s
and
we
all
of
us
used
to
clap
our
hands
loudly
and
to
shout
at
the
top
of
our
lungs
in
short
we
came
very
near
to
being
ejected
on
the
first
occasion
i
went
home
walking
as
in
a
mist
with
a
single
rouble
left
in
my
pocket
and
an
interval
of
ten
clear
days
confronting
me
before
next
yet
what
think
you
dearest
the
very
next
day
before
going
to
work
i
called
at
a
french
perfumer
s
and
spent
my
whole
remaining
capital
on
some
and
scented
soap
why
i
did
so
i
do
not
know
nor
did
i
dine
at
home
that
day
but
kept
walking
and
walking
past
her
windows
she
lived
in
a
flat
on
the
nevski
prospect
at
length
i
returned
to
my
own
lodging
but
only
to
rest
a
short
hour
before
again
setting
off
to
the
nevski
prospect
and
resuming
my
vigil
before
her
windows
for
a
month
and
a
half
i
kept
this
up
dangling
in
her
train
sometimes
i
would
hire
cabs
and
discharge
them
in
view
of
her
abode
until
at
length
i
had
entirely
ruined
myself
and
got
into
debt
then
i
fell
out
of
love
with
her
i
grew
weary
of
the
pursuit
you
see
therefore
to
what
depths
an
actress
can
reduce
a
decent
man
in
those
days
i
was
young
yes
in
those
days
i
was
very
young
july
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
the
book
which
i
received
from
you
on
the
of
this
month
i
now
hasten
to
return
while
at
the
same
time
hastening
also
to
explain
matters
to
you
in
this
accompanying
letter
what
a
misfortune
my
beloved
that
you
should
have
brought
me
to
such
a
pass
our
lots
in
life
are
apportioned
by
the
almighty
according
to
our
human
deserts
to
such
a
one
he
assigns
a
life
in
a
general
s
epaulets
or
as
a
privy
councillor
to
such
a
one
i
say
he
assigns
a
life
of
command
whereas
to
another
one
he
allots
only
a
life
of
unmurmuring
toil
and
suffering
these
things
are
calculated
according
to
a
man
s
capacity
one
man
may
be
capable
of
one
thing
and
another
of
another
and
their
several
capacities
are
ordered
by
the
lord
god
himself
i
have
now
been
thirty
years
in
the
public
service
and
have
fulfilled
my
duties
irreproachably
remained
abstemious
and
never
been
detected
in
any
unbecoming
behaviour
as
a
citizen
i
may
confess
i
confess
it
freely
i
have
been
guilty
of
certain
shortcomings
yet
those
shortcomings
have
been
combined
with
certain
virtues
i
am
respected
by
my
superiors
and
even
his
excellency
has
had
no
fault
to
find
with
me
and
though
i
have
never
been
shown
any
special
marks
of
favour
i
know
that
every
one
finds
me
at
least
satisfactory
also
my
writing
is
sufficiently
legible
and
clear
neither
too
rounded
nor
too
fine
it
is
a
running
hand
yet
always
suitable
of
our
staff
only
ivan
prokofievitch
writes
a
similar
hand
thus
have
i
lived
till
the
grey
hairs
of
my
old
age
yet
i
can
think
of
no
serious
fault
committed
of
course
no
one
is
free
from
minor
faults
everyone
has
some
of
them
and
you
among
the
rest
my
beloved
but
in
grave
or
in
audacious
offences
never
have
i
been
detected
nor
in
infringements
of
regulations
nor
in
breaches
of
the
public
peace
no
never
this
you
surely
know
even
as
the
author
of
your
book
must
have
known
it
yes
he
also
must
have
known
it
when
he
sat
down
to
write
i
had
not
expected
this
of
you
my
barbara
i
should
never
have
expected
it
what
in
future
i
am
not
to
go
on
living
peacefully
in
my
little
corner
poor
though
that
corner
be
i
am
not
to
go
on
living
as
the
proverb
has
it
without
muddying
the
water
or
hurting
any
one
or
forgetting
the
fear
of
the
lord
god
and
of
oneself
i
am
not
to
see
forsooth
that
no
man
does
me
an
injury
or
breaks
into
my
home
i
am
not
to
take
care
that
all
shall
go
well
with
me
or
that
i
have
clothes
to
wear
or
that
my
shoes
do
not
require
mending
or
that
i
be
given
work
to
do
or
that
i
possess
sufficient
meat
and
drink
is
it
nothing
that
where
the
pavement
is
rotten
i
have
to
walk
on
tiptoe
to
save
my
boots
if
i
write
to
you
overmuch
concerning
myself
is
it
concerning
another
man
rather
that
i
ought
to
write
concerning
his
wants
concerning
his
lack
of
tea
to
drink
and
all
the
world
needs
tea
has
it
ever
been
my
custom
to
pry
into
other
men
s
mouths
to
see
what
is
being
put
into
them
have
i
ever
been
known
to
offend
any
one
in
that
respect
no
no
beloved
why
should
i
desire
to
insult
other
folks
when
they
are
not
molesting
me
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
mean
a
man
may
go
on
slaving
and
slaving
in
the
public
service
and
earn
the
respect
of
his
superiors
for
what
it
is
worth
and
then
for
no
visible
reason
at
all
find
himself
made
a
fool
of
of
course
he
may
break
out
now
and
then
i
am
not
now
referring
only
to
drunkenness
and
for
example
buy
himself
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
take
pleasure
in
seeing
his
feet
looking
well
and
smartly
shod
yes
i
myself
have
known
what
it
is
to
feel
like
that
i
write
this
in
good
faith
yet
i
am
nonetheless
astonished
that
thedor
thedorovitch
should
neglect
what
is
being
said
about
him
and
take
no
steps
to
defend
himself
true
he
is
only
a
subordinate
official
and
sometimes
loves
to
rate
and
scold
yet
why
should
he
not
do
so
why
should
he
not
indulge
in
a
little
vituperation
when
he
feels
like
it
suppose
it
to
be
necessary
for
form
s
sake
to
scold
and
to
set
everyone
right
and
to
shower
around
abuse
for
between
ourselves
barbara
our
friend
can
not
get
on
without
abuse
so
much
so
that
every
one
humours
him
and
does
things
behind
his
back
well
since
officials
differ
in
rank
and
every
official
demands
that
he
shall
be
allowed
to
abuse
his
fellow
officials
in
proportion
to
his
rank
it
follows
that
the
tone
also
of
official
abuse
should
become
divided
into
ranks
and
thus
accord
with
the
natural
order
of
things
all
the
world
is
built
upon
the
system
that
each
one
of
us
shall
have
to
yield
precedence
to
some
other
one
as
well
as
to
enjoy
a
certain
power
of
abusing
his
fellows
without
such
a
provision
the
world
could
not
get
on
at
all
and
simple
chaos
would
ensue
yet
i
am
surprised
that
our
thedor
should
continue
to
overlook
insults
of
the
kind
that
he
endures
why
do
i
do
my
official
work
at
all
why
is
that
necessary
will
my
doing
of
it
lead
anyone
who
reads
it
to
give
me
a
greatcoat
or
to
buy
me
a
new
pair
of
shoes
no
barbara
men
only
read
the
documents
and
then
require
me
to
write
more
sometimes
a
man
will
hide
himself
away
and
not
show
his
face
abroad
for
the
mere
reason
that
though
he
has
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
he
dreads
the
gossip
and
slandering
which
are
everywhere
to
be
encountered
if
his
civic
and
family
life
have
to
do
with
literature
everything
will
be
printed
and
read
and
laughed
over
and
discussed
until
at
length
he
hardly
dare
show
his
face
in
the
street
at
all
seeing
that
he
will
have
been
described
by
report
as
recognisable
through
his
gait
alone
then
when
he
has
amended
his
ways
and
grown
gentler
even
though
he
still
continues
to
be
loaded
with
official
work
he
will
come
to
be
accounted
a
virtuous
decent
citizen
who
has
deserved
well
of
his
comrades
rendered
obedience
to
his
superiors
wished
noone
any
evil
preserved
the
fear
of
god
in
his
heart
and
died
lamented
yet
would
it
not
be
better
instead
of
letting
the
poor
fellow
die
to
give
him
a
cloak
while
yet
he
is
alive
to
give
it
to
this
same
thedor
thedorovitch
that
is
to
say
to
myself
yes
twere
far
better
if
on
hearing
the
tale
of
his
subordinate
s
virtues
the
chief
of
the
department
were
to
call
the
deserving
man
into
his
office
and
then
and
there
to
promote
him
and
to
grant
him
an
increase
of
salary
thus
vice
would
be
punished
virtue
would
prevail
and
the
staff
of
that
department
would
live
in
peace
together
here
we
have
an
example
from
everyday
commonplace
life
how
therefore
could
you
bring
yourself
to
send
me
that
book
my
beloved
it
is
a
badly
conceived
work
barbara
and
also
unreal
for
the
reason
that
in
creation
such
a
tchinovnik
does
not
exist
no
again
i
protest
against
it
little
barbara
again
i
your
most
humble
devoted
servant
july
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
your
latest
conduct
and
letters
had
frightened
me
and
left
me
thunderstruck
and
plunged
in
doubt
until
what
you
have
said
about
thedor
explained
the
situation
why
despair
and
go
into
such
frenzies
makar
alexievitch
your
explanations
only
partially
satisfy
me
perhaps
i
did
wrong
to
insist
upon
accepting
a
good
situation
when
it
was
offered
me
seeing
that
from
my
last
experience
in
that
way
i
derived
a
shock
which
was
anything
but
a
matter
for
jesting
you
say
also
that
your
love
for
me
has
compelled
you
to
hide
yourself
in
retirement
now
how
much
i
am
indebted
to
you
i
realised
when
you
told
me
that
you
were
spending
for
my
benefit
the
sum
which
you
are
always
reported
to
have
laid
by
at
your
bankers
but
now
that
i
have
learned
that
you
never
possessed
such
a
fund
but
that
on
hearing
of
my
destitute
plight
and
being
moved
by
it
you
decided
to
spend
upon
me
the
whole
of
your
salary
even
to
forestall
it
and
when
i
had
fallen
ill
actually
to
sell
your
clothes
when
i
learned
all
this
i
found
myself
placed
in
the
harassing
position
of
not
knowing
how
to
accept
it
all
nor
what
to
think
of
it
ah
makar
alexievitch
you
ought
to
have
stopped
at
your
first
acts
of
charity
acts
inspired
by
sympathy
and
the
love
of
kinsfolk
rather
than
have
continued
to
squander
your
means
upon
what
was
unnecessary
yes
you
have
betrayed
our
friendship
makar
alexievitch
in
that
you
have
not
been
open
with
me
and
now
that
i
see
that
your
last
coin
has
been
spent
upon
dresses
and
and
excursions
and
books
and
visits
to
the
theatre
for
me
i
weep
bitter
tears
for
my
unpardonable
improvidence
in
having
accepted
these
things
without
giving
so
much
as
a
thought
to
your
welfare
yes
all
that
you
have
done
to
give
me
pleasure
has
become
converted
into
a
source
of
grief
and
left
behind
it
only
useless
regret
of
late
i
have
remarked
that
you
were
looking
depressed
and
though
i
felt
fearful
that
something
unfortunate
was
impending
what
has
happened
would
otherwise
never
have
entered
my
head
to
think
that
your
better
sense
should
so
play
you
false
makar
alexievitch
what
will
people
think
of
you
and
say
of
you
who
will
want
to
know
you
you
whom
like
everyone
else
i
have
valued
for
your
goodness
of
heart
and
modesty
and
good
sense
you
i
say
have
now
given
way
to
an
unpleasant
vice
of
which
you
seem
never
before
to
have
been
guilty
what
were
my
feelings
when
thedora
informed
me
that
you
had
been
discovered
drunk
in
the
street
and
taken
home
by
the
police
why
i
felt
petrified
with
astonishment
although
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
had
failed
me
for
four
days
i
had
been
expecting
some
such
extraordinary
occurrence
also
have
you
thought
what
your
superiors
will
say
of
you
when
they
come
to
learn
the
true
reason
of
your
absence
you
say
that
everyone
is
laughing
at
you
that
every
one
has
learned
of
the
bond
which
exists
between
us
and
that
your
neighbours
habitually
refer
to
me
with
a
sneer
pay
no
attention
to
this
makar
alexievitch
for
the
love
of
god
be
comforted
also
the
incident
between
you
and
the
officers
has
much
alarmed
me
although
i
had
heard
certain
rumours
concerning
it
pray
explain
to
me
what
it
means
you
write
too
that
you
have
been
afraid
to
be
open
with
me
for
the
reason
that
your
confessions
might
lose
you
my
friendship
also
you
say
that
you
are
in
despair
at
the
thought
of
being
unable
to
help
me
in
my
illness
owing
to
the
fact
that
you
have
sold
everything
which
might
have
maintained
me
and
preserved
me
in
sickness
as
well
as
that
you
have
borrowed
as
much
as
it
is
possible
for
you
to
borrow
and
are
daily
experiencing
unpleasantness
with
your
landlady
well
in
failing
to
reveal
all
this
to
me
you
chose
the
worse
course
now
however
i
know
all
you
have
forced
me
to
recognise
that
i
have
been
the
cause
of
your
unhappy
plight
as
well
as
that
my
own
conduct
has
brought
upon
myself
a
twofold
measure
of
sorrow
the
fact
leaves
me
thunderstruck
makar
alexievitch
ah
friend
an
infectious
disease
is
indeed
a
misfortune
for
now
we
poor
and
miserable
folk
must
perforce
keep
apart
from
one
another
lest
the
infection
be
increased
yes
i
have
brought
upon
you
calamities
which
never
before
in
your
humble
solitary
life
you
had
experienced
this
tortures
and
exhausts
me
more
than
i
can
tell
to
think
of
write
to
me
quite
frankly
tell
me
how
you
came
to
embark
upon
such
a
course
of
conduct
comfort
oh
comfort
me
if
you
can
it
is
not
that
prompts
me
to
speak
of
my
own
comforting
but
my
friendship
and
love
for
you
which
will
never
fade
from
my
heart
goodbye
i
await
your
answer
with
impatience
you
have
thought
but
poorly
of
me
makar
your
friend
and
lover
barbara
dobroselova
july
my
priceless
barbara
alexievna
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
now
that
all
is
over
and
we
are
gradually
returning
to
our
old
position
you
say
that
you
are
anxious
as
to
what
will
be
thought
of
me
let
me
tell
you
that
the
dearest
thing
in
life
to
me
is
my
wherefore
in
informing
you
of
my
misfortunes
and
misconduct
i
would
add
that
none
of
my
superiors
know
of
my
doings
nor
ever
will
know
of
them
and
that
therefore
i
still
enjoy
a
measure
of
respect
in
that
quarter
only
one
thing
do
i
fear
i
fear
gossip
garrulous
though
my
landlady
be
she
said
but
little
when
with
the
aid
of
your
ten
roubles
i
today
paid
her
part
of
her
account
and
as
for
the
rest
of
my
companions
they
do
not
matter
at
all
so
long
as
i
have
not
borrowed
money
from
them
i
need
pay
them
no
attention
to
conclude
my
explanations
let
me
tell
you
that
i
value
your
respect
for
me
above
everything
in
the
world
and
have
found
it
my
greatest
comfort
during
this
temporary
distress
of
mine
thank
god
the
first
shock
of
things
has
abated
now
that
you
have
agreed
not
to
look
upon
me
as
faithless
and
an
egotist
simply
because
i
have
deceived
you
i
wish
to
hold
you
to
myself
for
the
reason
that
i
can
not
bear
to
part
with
you
and
love
you
as
my
guardian
angel
i
have
now
returned
to
work
and
am
applying
myself
diligently
to
my
duties
also
yesterday
evstafi
ivanovitch
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
me
yet
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
the
fact
that
my
debts
are
crushing
me
down
and
that
my
wardrobe
is
in
a
sorry
state
at
the
same
time
these
things
do
not
really
matter
and
i
would
bid
you
not
despair
about
them
send
me
however
another
if
you
can
though
that
will
stab
me
to
the
heart
stab
me
with
the
thought
that
it
is
not
i
who
am
helping
you
but
you
who
are
helping
me
thedora
has
done
well
to
get
those
fifteen
roubles
for
you
at
the
moment
fool
of
an
old
man
that
i
am
i
have
no
hope
of
acquiring
any
more
money
but
as
soon
as
ever
i
do
so
i
will
write
to
you
and
let
you
know
all
about
it
what
chiefly
worries
me
is
the
fear
of
gossip
goodbye
little
angel
i
kiss
your
hands
and
beseech
you
to
regain
your
health
if
this
is
not
a
detailed
letter
the
reason
is
that
i
must
soon
be
starting
for
the
office
in
order
that
by
strict
application
to
duty
i
may
make
amends
for
the
past
further
information
concerning
my
doings
as
well
as
concerning
that
affair
with
the
officers
must
be
deferred
until
your
affectionate
and
respectful
friend
makar
dievushkin
july
dearest
little
barbara
it
is
you
who
have
committed
a
fault
and
one
which
must
weigh
heavily
upon
your
conscience
indeed
your
last
letter
has
amazed
and
confounded
me
so
much
so
that
on
once
more
looking
into
the
recesses
of
my
heart
i
perceive
that
i
was
perfectly
right
in
what
i
did
of
course
i
am
not
now
referring
to
my
debauch
no
indeed
but
to
the
fact
that
i
love
you
and
to
the
fact
that
it
is
unwise
of
me
to
love
you
very
unwise
you
know
not
how
matters
stand
my
darling
you
know
not
why
i
am
bound
to
love
you
otherwise
you
would
not
say
all
that
you
do
yet
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
your
head
rather
than
your
heart
that
is
speaking
i
am
certain
that
your
heart
thinks
very
differently
what
occurred
that
night
between
myself
and
those
officers
i
scarcely
know
i
scarcely
remember
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
for
some
time
past
i
have
been
in
terrible
distress
that
for
a
whole
month
i
have
been
so
to
speak
hanging
by
a
single
thread
indeed
my
position
has
been
most
pitiable
though
i
hid
myself
from
you
my
landlady
was
forever
shouting
and
railing
at
me
this
would
not
have
mattered
a
jot
the
horrible
old
woman
might
have
shouted
as
much
as
she
pleased
had
it
not
been
that
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
disgrace
of
it
and
in
the
second
place
she
had
somehow
learned
of
our
connection
and
kept
proclaiming
it
to
the
household
until
i
felt
perfectly
deafened
and
had
to
stop
my
ears
the
point
however
is
that
other
people
did
not
stop
their
ears
but
on
the
contrary
pricked
them
indeed
i
am
at
a
loss
what
to
do
really
this
wretched
rabble
has
driven
me
to
extremities
it
all
began
with
my
hearing
a
strange
rumour
from
thedora
namely
that
an
unworthy
suitor
had
been
to
visit
you
and
had
insulted
you
with
an
improper
proposal
that
he
had
insulted
you
deeply
i
knew
from
my
own
feelings
for
i
felt
insulted
in
an
equal
degree
upon
that
my
angel
i
went
to
pieces
and
losing
all
plunged
headlong
bursting
into
an
unspeakable
frenzy
i
was
at
once
going
to
call
upon
this
villain
of
a
seducer
though
what
to
do
next
i
knew
not
seeing
that
i
was
fearful
of
giving
you
offence
ah
what
a
night
of
sorrow
it
was
and
what
a
time
of
gloom
rain
and
sleet
next
i
was
returning
home
but
found
myself
unable
to
stand
upon
my
feet
then
emelia
ilyitch
happened
to
come
by
he
also
is
a
tchinovnik
or
rather
was
a
tchinovnik
since
he
was
turned
out
of
the
service
some
time
ago
what
he
was
doing
there
at
that
moment
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
went
with
him
surely
it
can
not
give
you
pleasure
to
read
of
the
misfortunes
of
your
friend
of
his
sorrows
and
of
the
temptations
which
he
experienced
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
emelia
urged
me
to
go
and
see
the
officer
of
whom
i
have
spoken
and
whose
address
i
had
learned
from
our
dvornik
more
strictly
speaking
i
had
noticed
him
when
on
a
previous
occasion
he
had
come
to
play
cards
here
and
i
had
followed
him
home
of
course
i
now
see
that
i
did
wrong
but
i
felt
beside
myself
when
i
heard
them
telling
him
stories
about
me
exactly
what
happened
next
i
can
not
remember
i
only
remember
that
several
other
officers
were
present
as
well
as
he
or
it
may
be
that
i
saw
everything
double
god
alone
knows
also
i
can
not
exactly
remember
what
i
said
i
only
remember
that
in
my
fury
i
said
a
great
deal
then
they
turned
me
out
of
the
room
and
threw
me
down
the
staircase
pushed
me
down
it
that
is
to
say
how
i
got
home
you
know
that
is
all
of
course
later
i
blamed
myself
and
my
pride
underwent
a
fall
but
no
extraneous
person
except
yourself
knows
of
the
affair
and
in
any
case
it
does
not
matter
perhaps
the
affair
is
as
you
imagine
it
to
have
been
barbara
one
thing
i
know
for
certain
and
that
is
that
last
year
one
of
our
lodgers
aksenti
osipovitch
took
a
similar
liberty
with
peter
petrovitch
yet
kept
the
fact
secret
an
absolute
secret
he
called
him
into
his
room
i
happened
to
be
looking
through
a
crack
in
the
and
had
an
explanation
with
him
in
the
way
that
a
gentleman
should
noone
except
myself
being
a
witness
of
the
scene
whereas
in
my
own
case
i
had
no
explanation
at
all
after
the
scene
was
over
nothing
further
transpired
between
aksenti
osipovitch
and
peter
petrovitch
for
the
reason
that
the
latter
was
so
desirous
of
getting
on
in
life
that
he
held
his
tongue
as
a
result
they
bow
and
shake
hands
whenever
they
meet
i
will
not
dispute
the
fact
that
i
have
erred
most
grievously
that
i
should
never
dare
to
dispute
or
that
i
have
fallen
greatly
in
my
own
estimation
but
i
think
i
was
fated
from
birth
so
to
do
and
one
can
not
escape
fate
my
beloved
here
therefore
is
a
detailed
explanation
of
my
misfortunes
and
sorrows
written
for
you
to
read
whenever
you
may
find
it
convenient
i
am
far
from
well
beloved
and
have
lost
all
my
gaiety
of
disposition
but
i
send
you
this
letter
as
a
token
of
my
love
devotion
and
respect
oh
dear
lady
of
my
your
humble
servant
makar
dievushkin
july
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
i
have
read
your
two
letters
and
they
make
my
heart
ache
see
here
dear
friend
of
mine
you
pass
over
certain
things
in
silence
and
write
about
a
portion
only
of
your
misfortunes
can
it
be
that
the
letters
are
the
outcome
of
a
mental
disorder
come
and
see
me
for
god
s
sake
come
today
direct
from
the
office
and
dine
with
us
as
you
have
done
before
as
to
how
you
are
living
now
or
as
to
what
settlement
you
have
made
with
your
landlady
i
know
not
for
you
write
nothing
concerning
those
two
points
and
seem
purposely
to
have
left
them
unmentioned
au
revoir
my
friend
come
to
me
today
without
fail
you
would
do
better
always
to
dine
here
thedora
is
an
excellent
cook
goodbye
your
own
barbara
dobroselova
august
my
darling
barbara
alexievna
thank
god
that
he
has
sent
you
a
chance
of
repaying
my
good
with
good
i
believe
in
so
doing
as
well
as
in
the
sweetness
of
your
angelic
heart
therefore
i
will
not
reproach
you
only
i
pray
you
do
not
again
blame
me
because
in
the
decline
of
my
life
i
have
played
the
spendthrift
it
was
such
a
sin
was
it
not
such
a
thing
to
do
and
even
if
you
would
still
have
it
that
the
sin
was
there
remember
little
friend
what
it
costs
me
to
hear
such
words
fall
from
your
lips
do
not
be
vexed
with
me
for
saying
this
for
my
heart
is
fainting
poor
people
are
subject
to
fancies
this
is
a
provision
of
nature
i
myself
have
had
reason
to
know
this
the
poor
man
is
exacting
he
can
not
see
god
s
world
as
it
is
but
eyes
each
askance
and
looks
around
him
uneasily
in
order
that
he
may
listen
to
every
word
that
is
being
uttered
may
not
people
be
talking
of
him
how
is
it
that
he
is
so
unsightly
what
is
he
feeling
at
all
what
sort
of
figure
is
he
cutting
on
the
one
side
or
on
the
other
it
is
matter
of
common
knowledge
my
barbara
that
the
poor
man
ranks
lower
than
a
rag
and
will
never
earn
the
respect
of
any
one
yes
write
about
him
as
you
like
let
scribblers
say
what
they
choose
about
him
he
will
ever
remain
as
he
was
and
why
is
this
it
is
because
from
his
very
nature
the
poor
man
has
to
wear
his
feelings
on
his
sleeve
so
that
nothing
about
him
is
sacred
and
as
for
his
well
emelia
told
me
the
other
day
that
once
when
he
had
to
collect
subscriptions
official
sanction
was
demanded
for
every
single
coin
since
people
thought
that
it
would
be
no
use
paying
their
money
to
a
poor
man
nowadays
charity
is
strangely
administered
perhaps
it
has
always
been
so
either
folk
do
not
know
how
to
administer
it
or
they
are
adept
in
the
art
one
of
the
two
perhaps
you
did
not
know
this
so
i
beg
to
tell
it
you
and
how
comes
it
that
the
poor
man
knows
is
so
conscious
of
it
all
the
answer
is
by
experience
he
knows
because
any
day
he
may
see
a
gentleman
enter
a
restaurant
and
ask
himself
what
shall
i
have
to
eat
today
i
will
have
such
and
such
a
dish
while
all
the
time
the
poor
man
will
have
nothing
to
eat
that
day
but
gruel
there
are
men
too
wretched
busybodies
who
walk
about
merely
to
see
if
they
can
find
some
wretched
tchinovnik
or
official
who
has
got
toes
projecting
from
his
boots
or
his
hair
uncut
and
when
they
have
found
such
a
one
they
make
a
report
of
the
circumstance
and
their
rubbish
gets
entered
on
the
file
but
what
does
it
matter
to
you
if
my
hair
lacks
the
shears
if
you
will
forgive
me
what
may
seem
to
you
a
piece
of
rudeness
i
declare
that
the
poor
man
is
ashamed
of
such
things
with
the
sensitiveness
of
a
young
girl
you
for
instance
would
not
care
pray
pardon
my
bluntness
to
unrobe
yourself
before
the
public
eye
and
in
the
same
way
the
poor
man
does
not
like
to
be
pried
at
or
questioned
concerning
his
family
relations
and
so
forth
a
man
of
honour
and
such
as
i
am
finds
it
painful
and
grievous
to
have
to
consort
with
men
who
would
deprive
him
of
both
today
i
sat
before
my
colleagues
like
a
bear
s
cub
or
a
plucked
sparrow
so
that
i
fairly
burned
with
shame
yes
it
hurt
me
terribly
barbara
naturally
one
blushes
when
one
can
see
one
s
naked
toes
projecting
through
one
s
boots
and
one
s
buttons
hanging
by
a
single
thread
as
though
on
purpose
i
seemed
on
this
occasion
to
be
peculiarly
dishevelled
no
wonder
that
my
spirits
fell
when
i
was
talking
on
business
matters
to
stepan
karlovitch
he
suddenly
exclaimed
for
no
apparent
reason
ah
poor
old
makar
alexievitch
and
then
left
the
rest
unfinished
but
i
knew
what
he
had
in
his
mind
and
blushed
so
hotly
that
even
the
bald
patch
on
my
head
grew
red
of
course
the
whole
thing
is
nothing
but
it
worries
me
and
leads
to
anxious
thoughts
what
can
these
fellows
know
about
me
god
send
that
they
know
nothing
but
i
confess
that
i
suspect
i
strongly
suspect
one
of
my
colleagues
let
them
only
betray
me
they
would
betray
one
s
private
life
for
a
groat
for
they
hold
nothing
sacred
i
have
an
idea
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
it
is
rataziaev
probably
he
knows
someone
in
our
department
to
whom
he
has
recounted
the
story
with
additions
or
perhaps
he
has
spread
it
abroad
in
his
own
department
and
thence
it
has
crept
and
crawled
into
ours
everyone
here
knows
it
down
to
the
last
detail
for
i
have
seen
them
point
at
you
with
their
fingers
through
the
window
oh
yes
i
have
seen
them
do
it
yesterday
when
i
stepped
across
to
dine
with
you
the
whole
crew
were
hanging
out
of
the
window
to
watch
me
and
the
landlady
exclaimed
that
the
devil
was
in
young
people
and
called
you
certain
unbecoming
names
but
this
is
as
nothing
compared
with
rataziaev
s
foul
intention
to
place
us
in
his
books
and
to
describe
us
in
a
satire
he
himself
has
declared
that
he
is
going
to
do
so
and
other
people
say
the
same
in
fact
i
know
not
what
to
think
nor
what
to
decide
it
is
no
use
concealing
the
fact
that
you
and
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
god
you
were
going
to
send
me
a
book
of
some
sort
to
divert
my
mind
were
you
not
dearest
what
book
though
could
now
divert
me
only
such
books
as
have
never
existed
on
earth
novels
are
rubbish
and
written
for
fools
and
for
the
idle
believe
me
dearest
i
know
it
through
long
experience
even
should
they
vaunt
shakespeare
to
you
i
tell
you
that
shakespeare
is
rubbish
and
proper
only
for
lampoons
your
own
makar
dievushkin
august
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
do
not
disquiet
yourself
god
will
grant
that
all
shall
turn
out
well
thedora
has
obtained
a
quantity
of
work
both
for
me
and
herself
and
we
are
setting
about
it
with
a
will
perhaps
it
will
put
us
straight
again
thedora
suspects
my
late
misfortunes
to
be
connected
with
anna
thedorovna
but
i
do
not
care
i
feel
extraordinarily
cheerful
today
so
you
are
thinking
of
borrowing
more
money
if
so
may
god
preserve
you
for
you
will
assuredly
be
ruined
when
the
time
comes
for
repayment
you
had
far
better
come
and
live
with
us
here
for
a
little
while
yes
come
and
take
up
your
abode
here
and
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
what
your
landlady
says
as
for
the
rest
of
your
enemies
and
i
am
certain
that
it
is
with
vain
imaginings
that
you
are
vexing
yourself
in
passing
let
me
tell
you
that
your
style
differs
greatly
from
letter
to
letter
goodbye
until
we
meet
again
i
await
your
coming
with
impatience
your
own
august
my
angel
barbara
alexievna
i
hasten
to
inform
you
oh
light
of
my
life
that
my
hopes
are
rising
again
but
little
daughter
of
mine
do
you
really
mean
it
when
you
say
that
i
am
to
indulge
in
no
more
borrowings
why
i
could
not
do
without
them
things
would
go
badly
with
us
both
if
i
did
so
you
are
ailing
consequently
i
tell
you
roundly
that
i
must
borrow
and
that
i
must
continue
to
do
so
also
i
may
tell
you
that
my
seat
in
the
office
is
now
next
to
that
of
a
certain
emelia
ivanovitch
he
is
not
the
emelia
whom
you
know
but
a
man
who
like
myself
is
a
privy
councillor
as
well
as
represents
with
myself
the
senior
and
oldest
official
in
our
department
likewise
he
is
a
good
disinterested
soul
and
one
that
is
not
though
a
true
bear
in
appearance
and
demeanour
industrious
and
possessed
of
a
handwriting
purely
english
his
caligraphy
is
it
must
be
confessed
even
worse
than
my
own
yes
he
is
a
good
soul
at
the
same
time
we
have
never
been
intimate
with
one
another
we
have
done
no
more
than
exchange
greetings
on
meeting
or
parting
borrow
one
another
s
penknife
if
we
needed
one
and
in
short
observe
such
bare
civilities
as
convention
demands
well
today
he
said
to
me
makar
alexievitch
what
makes
you
look
so
thoughtful
and
inasmuch
as
i
could
see
that
he
wished
me
well
i
told
him
all
or
rather
i
did
not
tell
him
everything
for
that
i
do
to
no
man
i
have
not
the
heart
to
do
it
i
told
him
just
a
few
scattered
details
concerning
my
financial
straits
then
you
ought
to
borrow
said
he
you
ought
to
obtain
a
loan
of
peter
petrovitch
who
does
a
little
in
that
way
i
myself
once
borrowed
some
money
of
him
and
he
charged
me
fair
and
light
well
barbara
my
heart
leapt
within
me
at
these
words
i
kept
thinking
and
thinking
if
only
god
would
put
it
into
the
mind
of
peter
petrovitch
to
be
my
benefactor
by
advancing
me
a
loan
i
calculated
that
with
its
aid
i
might
both
repay
my
landlady
and
assist
yourself
and
get
rid
of
my
surroundings
where
i
can
hardly
sit
down
to
table
without
the
rascals
making
jokes
about
me
sometimes
his
excellency
passes
our
desk
in
the
office
he
glances
at
me
and
can
not
but
perceive
how
poorly
i
am
dressed
now
neatness
and
cleanliness
are
two
of
his
strongest
points
even
though
he
says
nothing
i
feel
ready
to
die
with
shame
when
he
approaches
well
hardening
my
heart
and
putting
my
diffidence
into
my
ragged
pocket
i
approached
peter
petrovitch
and
halted
before
him
more
dead
than
alive
yet
i
was
hopeful
and
though
as
it
turned
out
he
was
busily
engaged
in
talking
to
thedosei
ivanovitch
i
walked
up
to
him
from
behind
and
plucked
at
his
sleeve
he
looked
away
from
me
but
i
recited
my
speech
about
thirty
roubles
et
cetera
et
cetera
of
which
at
first
he
failed
to
catch
the
meaning
even
when
i
had
explained
matters
to
him
more
fully
he
only
burst
out
laughing
and
said
nothing
again
i
addressed
to
him
my
request
whereupon
asking
me
what
security
i
could
give
he
again
buried
himself
in
his
papers
and
went
on
writing
without
deigning
me
even
a
second
glance
dismay
seized
me
peter
petrovitch
i
said
i
can
offer
you
no
security
but
to
this
i
added
an
explanation
that
some
salary
would
in
time
be
due
to
me
which
i
would
make
over
to
him
and
account
the
loan
my
first
debt
at
that
moment
someone
called
him
away
and
i
had
to
wait
a
little
on
returning
he
began
to
mend
his
pen
as
though
he
had
not
even
noticed
that
i
was
there
but
i
was
for
myself
this
time
peter
petrovitch
i
continued
can
you
not
do
anything
still
he
maintained
silence
and
seemed
not
to
have
heard
me
i
waited
and
waited
at
length
i
determined
to
make
a
final
attempt
and
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
he
muttered
something
and
his
pen
mended
set
about
his
writing
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
depart
he
and
the
rest
of
them
are
worthy
fellows
dearest
that
i
do
not
doubt
but
they
are
also
proud
very
proud
what
have
i
to
do
with
them
yet
i
thought
i
would
write
and
tell
you
all
about
it
meanwhile
emelia
ivanovitch
had
been
encouraging
me
with
nods
and
smiles
he
is
a
good
soul
and
has
promised
to
recommend
me
to
a
friend
of
his
who
lives
in
viborskaia
street
and
lends
money
emelia
declares
that
this
friend
will
certainly
lend
me
a
little
so
tomorrow
beloved
i
am
going
to
call
upon
the
gentleman
in
question
what
do
you
think
about
it
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
obtain
a
loan
my
landlady
is
on
the
point
of
turning
me
out
of
doors
and
has
refused
to
allow
me
any
more
board
also
my
boots
are
wearing
through
and
have
lost
every
button
and
i
do
not
possess
another
pair
could
anyone
in
a
government
office
display
greater
shabbiness
it
is
dreadful
my
barbara
it
is
simply
dreadful
makar
dievushkin
august
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
for
god
s
sake
borrow
some
money
as
soon
as
you
can
i
would
not
ask
this
help
of
you
were
it
not
for
the
situation
in
which
i
am
placed
thedora
and
myself
can
not
remain
any
longer
in
our
present
lodgings
for
we
have
been
subjected
to
great
unpleasantness
and
you
can
not
imagine
my
state
of
agitation
and
dismay
the
reason
is
that
this
morning
we
received
a
visit
from
an
elderly
almost
an
old
man
whose
breast
was
studded
with
orders
greatly
surprised
i
asked
him
what
he
wanted
for
at
the
moment
thedora
had
gone
out
shopping
whereupon
he
began
to
question
me
as
to
my
mode
of
life
and
occupation
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
informed
me
that
he
was
uncle
to
the
officer
of
whom
you
have
spoken
that
he
was
very
angry
with
his
nephew
for
the
way
in
which
the
latter
had
behaved
especially
with
regard
to
his
slandering
of
me
right
and
left
and
that
he
the
uncle
was
ready
to
protect
me
from
the
young
spendthrift
s
insolence
also
he
advised
me
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
young
fellows
of
that
stamp
and
added
that
he
sympathised
with
me
as
though
he
were
my
own
father
and
would
gladly
help
me
in
any
way
he
could
at
this
i
blushed
in
some
confusion
but
did
not
greatly
hasten
to
thank
him
next
he
took
me
forcibly
by
the
hand
and
tapping
my
cheek
said
that
i
was
very
and
that
he
greatly
liked
the
dimples
in
my
face
god
only
knows
what
he
meant
finally
he
tried
to
kiss
me
on
the
plea
that
he
was
an
old
man
the
brute
at
this
moment
thedora
returned
whereupon
in
some
confusion
he
repeated
that
he
felt
a
great
respect
for
my
modesty
and
virtue
and
that
he
much
wished
to
become
acquainted
with
me
after
which
he
took
thedora
aside
and
tried
on
some
pretext
or
another
to
give
her
money
though
of
course
she
declined
it
at
last
he
took
himself
off
again
reiterating
his
assurances
and
saying
that
he
intended
to
return
with
some
earrings
as
a
present
that
he
advised
me
to
change
my
lodgings
and
that
he
could
recommend
me
a
splendid
flat
which
he
had
in
his
mind
s
eye
as
likely
to
cost
me
nothing
yes
he
also
declared
that
he
greatly
liked
me
for
my
purity
and
good
sense
that
i
must
beware
of
dissolute
young
men
and
that
he
knew
anna
thedorovna
who
had
charged
him
to
inform
me
that
she
would
shortly
be
visiting
me
in
person
upon
that
i
understood
all
what
i
did
next
i
scarcely
know
for
i
had
never
before
found
myself
in
such
a
position
but
i
believe
that
i
broke
all
restraints
and
made
the
old
man
feel
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
thedora
helping
me
in
the
task
and
turning
him
neck
and
crop
out
of
the
tenement
neither
of
us
doubt
that
this
is
anna
thedorovna
s
work
for
how
otherwise
could
the
old
man
have
got
to
know
about
us
now
therefore
makar
alexievitch
i
turn
to
you
for
help
do
not
for
god
s
sake
leave
me
in
this
plight
borrow
all
the
money
that
you
can
get
for
i
have
not
the
wherewithal
to
leave
these
lodgings
yet
can
not
possibly
remain
in
them
any
longer
at
all
events
this
is
thedora
s
advice
she
and
i
need
at
least
roubles
which
i
will
repay
you
out
of
what
i
earn
by
my
work
while
thedora
shall
get
me
additional
work
from
day
to
day
so
that
if
there
be
heavy
interest
to
pay
on
the
loan
you
shall
not
be
troubled
with
the
extra
burden
nay
i
will
make
over
to
you
all
that
i
possess
if
only
you
will
continue
to
help
me
truly
i
grieve
to
have
to
trouble
you
when
you
yourself
are
so
hardly
situated
but
my
hopes
rest
upon
you
and
upon
you
alone
goodbye
makar
alexievitch
think
of
me
and
may
god
speed
you
on
your
errand
august
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
these
blows
have
shaken
me
terribly
and
these
strange
calamities
have
quite
broken
my
spirit
not
content
with
trying
to
bring
you
to
a
bed
of
sickness
these
lickspittles
and
pestilent
old
men
are
trying
to
bring
me
to
the
same
and
i
assure
you
that
they
are
succeeding
i
assure
you
that
they
are
yet
i
would
rather
die
than
not
help
you
if
i
can
not
help
you
i
shall
die
but
to
enable
me
to
help
you
you
must
flee
like
a
bird
out
of
the
nest
where
these
owls
these
birds
of
prey
are
seeking
to
peck
you
to
death
how
distressed
i
feel
my
dearest
yet
how
cruel
you
yourself
are
although
you
are
enduring
pain
and
insult
although
you
little
nestling
are
in
agony
of
spirit
you
actually
tell
me
that
it
grieves
you
to
disturb
me
and
that
you
will
work
off
your
debt
to
me
with
the
labour
of
your
own
hands
in
other
words
you
with
your
weak
health
are
proposing
to
kill
yourself
in
order
to
relieve
me
to
term
of
my
financial
embarrassments
stop
a
moment
and
think
what
you
are
saying
why
should
you
sew
and
work
and
torture
your
poor
head
with
anxiety
and
spoil
your
beautiful
eyes
and
ruin
your
health
why
indeed
ah
little
barbara
little
barbara
do
you
not
see
that
i
shall
never
be
any
good
to
you
never
any
good
to
you
at
all
events
i
myself
see
it
yet
i
will
help
you
in
your
distress
i
will
overcome
every
difficulty
i
will
get
extra
work
to
do
i
will
copy
out
manuscripts
for
authors
i
will
go
to
the
latter
and
force
them
to
employ
me
i
will
so
apply
myself
to
the
work
that
they
shall
see
that
i
am
a
good
copyist
and
good
copyists
i
know
are
always
in
demand
thus
there
will
be
no
need
for
you
to
exhaust
your
strength
nor
will
i
allow
you
to
do
so
i
will
not
have
you
carry
out
your
disastrous
intention
yes
little
angel
i
will
certainly
borrow
some
money
i
would
rather
die
than
not
do
so
merely
tell
me
my
own
darling
that
i
am
not
to
shrink
from
heavy
interest
and
i
will
not
shrink
from
it
i
will
not
shrink
from
it
nay
i
will
shrink
from
nothing
i
will
ask
for
forty
roubles
to
begin
with
that
will
not
be
much
will
it
little
barbara
yet
will
any
one
trust
me
even
with
that
sum
at
the
first
asking
do
you
think
that
i
am
capable
of
inspiring
confidence
at
the
first
glance
would
the
mere
sight
of
my
face
lead
any
one
to
form
of
me
a
favourable
opinion
have
i
ever
been
able
remember
you
to
appear
to
anyone
in
a
favourable
light
what
think
you
personally
i
see
difficulties
in
the
way
and
feel
sick
at
heart
at
the
mere
prospect
however
of
those
forty
roubles
i
mean
to
set
aside
for
yourself
two
for
my
landlady
and
the
remainder
for
my
own
spending
of
course
i
ought
to
give
more
than
two
to
my
landlady
but
you
must
remember
my
necessities
and
see
for
yourself
that
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
assigned
to
her
we
need
say
no
more
about
it
for
one
rouble
i
shall
buy
me
a
new
pair
of
shoes
for
i
scarcely
know
whether
my
old
ones
will
take
me
to
the
office
tomorrow
morning
also
a
new
is
indispensable
seeing
that
the
old
one
has
now
passed
its
first
year
but
since
you
have
promised
to
make
of
your
old
apron
not
only
a
scarf
but
also
a
i
need
think
no
more
of
the
article
in
question
so
much
for
shoes
and
scarves
next
for
buttons
you
yourself
will
agree
that
i
can
not
do
without
buttons
nor
is
there
on
my
garments
a
single
hem
unfrayed
i
tremble
when
i
think
that
some
day
his
excellency
may
perceive
my
untidiness
and
say
well
what
will
he
not
say
yet
i
shall
never
hear
what
he
says
for
i
shall
have
expired
where
i
sit
expired
of
mere
shame
at
the
thought
of
having
been
thus
exposed
ah
dearest
well
my
various
necessities
will
have
left
me
three
roubles
to
go
on
with
part
of
this
sum
i
shall
expend
upon
a
of
tobacco
for
i
can
not
live
without
tobacco
and
it
is
nine
days
since
i
last
put
a
pipe
into
my
mouth
to
tell
the
truth
i
shall
buy
the
tobacco
without
acquainting
you
with
the
fact
although
i
ought
not
so
to
do
the
pity
of
it
all
is
that
while
you
are
depriving
yourself
of
everything
i
keep
solacing
myself
with
various
amenities
which
is
why
i
am
telling
you
this
that
the
pangs
of
conscience
may
not
torment
me
frankly
i
confess
that
i
am
in
desperate
straits
in
such
straits
as
i
have
never
yet
known
my
landlady
flouts
me
and
i
enjoy
the
respect
of
noone
my
arrears
and
debts
are
terrible
and
in
the
office
though
never
have
i
found
the
place
exactly
a
paradise
noone
has
a
single
word
to
say
to
me
yet
i
hide
i
carefully
hide
this
from
every
one
i
would
hide
my
person
in
the
same
way
were
it
not
that
daily
i
have
to
attend
the
office
where
i
have
to
be
constantly
on
my
guard
against
my
fellows
nevertheless
merely
to
be
able
to
confess
this
to
you
renews
my
spiritual
strength
we
must
not
think
of
these
things
barbara
lest
the
thought
of
them
break
our
courage
i
write
them
down
merely
to
warn
you
not
to
think
of
them
nor
to
torture
yourself
with
bitter
imaginings
yet
my
god
what
is
to
become
of
us
stay
where
you
are
until
i
can
come
to
you
after
which
i
shall
not
return
hither
but
simply
disappear
now
i
have
finished
my
letter
and
must
go
and
shave
myself
inasmuch
as
when
that
is
done
one
always
feels
more
decent
as
well
as
consorts
more
easily
with
decency
god
speed
me
one
prayer
to
him
and
i
must
be
off
dievushkin
august
dearest
makar
alexievitch
you
must
not
despair
away
with
melancholy
i
am
sending
you
thirty
kopecks
in
silver
and
regret
that
i
can
not
send
you
more
buy
yourself
what
you
most
need
until
tomorrow
i
myself
have
almost
nothing
left
and
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
know
not
is
it
not
dreadful
makar
alexievitch
yet
do
not
be
downcast
it
is
no
good
being
that
thedora
declares
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
we
were
to
remain
in
this
tenement
since
if
we
left
it
suspicions
would
arise
and
our
enemies
might
take
it
into
their
heads
to
look
for
us
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
remain
here
if
i
were
feeling
less
sad
i
would
tell
you
my
reason
what
a
strange
man
you
are
makar
alexievitch
you
take
things
so
much
to
heart
that
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
happy
i
read
your
letters
attentively
and
can
see
from
them
that
though
you
worry
and
disturb
yourself
about
me
you
never
give
a
thought
to
yourself
yes
every
letter
tells
me
that
you
have
a
kind
heart
but
i
tell
you
that
that
heart
is
overly
kind
so
i
will
give
you
a
little
friendly
advice
makar
alexievitch
i
am
full
of
gratitude
towards
you
i
am
indeed
full
for
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
i
am
most
sensible
of
your
goodness
but
to
think
that
i
should
be
forced
to
see
that
in
spite
of
your
own
troubles
of
which
i
have
been
the
involuntary
cause
you
live
for
me
alone
you
live
but
for
my
joys
and
my
sorrows
and
my
affection
if
you
take
the
affairs
of
another
person
so
to
heart
and
suffer
with
her
to
such
an
extent
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
yourself
are
unhappy
today
when
you
came
to
see
me
after
was
done
i
felt
afraid
even
to
raise
my
eyes
to
yours
for
you
looked
so
pale
and
desperate
and
your
face
had
so
fallen
in
yes
you
were
dreading
to
have
to
tell
me
of
your
failure
to
borrow
money
you
were
dreading
to
have
to
grieve
and
alarm
me
but
when
you
saw
that
i
came
very
near
to
smiling
the
load
was
i
know
lifted
from
your
heart
so
do
not
be
despondent
do
not
give
way
but
allow
more
rein
to
your
better
sense
i
beg
and
implore
this
of
you
for
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
see
things
take
a
turn
for
the
better
you
will
but
spoil
your
life
if
you
constantly
lament
another
person
s
sorrow
goodbye
dear
friend
i
beseech
you
not
to
be
about
me
august
my
darling
little
barbara
this
is
well
this
is
well
my
angel
so
you
are
of
opinion
that
the
fact
that
i
have
failed
to
obtain
any
money
does
not
matter
then
i
too
am
reassured
i
too
am
happy
on
your
account
also
i
am
delighted
to
think
that
you
are
not
going
to
desert
your
old
friend
but
intend
to
remain
in
your
present
lodgings
indeed
my
heart
was
overcharged
with
joy
when
i
read
in
your
letter
those
kindly
words
about
myself
as
well
as
a
not
wholly
unmerited
recognition
of
my
sentiments
i
say
this
not
out
of
pride
but
because
now
i
know
how
much
you
love
me
to
be
thus
solicitous
for
my
feelings
how
good
to
think
that
i
may
speak
to
you
of
them
you
bid
me
darling
not
be
indeed
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
be
so
think
for
instance
of
the
pair
of
shoes
which
i
shall
be
wearing
to
the
office
tomorrow
the
fact
is
that
proves
the
undoing
of
a
man
his
complete
undoing
what
has
saved
me
is
the
fact
that
it
is
not
for
myself
that
i
am
grieving
that
i
am
suffering
but
for
you
nor
would
it
matter
to
me
in
the
least
that
i
should
have
to
walk
through
the
bitter
cold
without
an
overcoat
or
boots
i
could
bear
it
i
could
well
endure
it
for
i
am
a
simple
man
in
my
requirements
but
the
point
is
what
would
people
say
what
would
every
envious
and
hostile
tongue
exclaim
when
i
was
seen
without
an
overcoat
it
is
for
other
folk
that
one
wears
an
overcoat
and
boots
in
any
case
therefore
i
should
have
needed
boots
to
maintain
my
name
and
reputation
to
both
of
which
my
ragged
footgear
would
otherwise
have
spelled
ruin
yes
it
is
so
my
beloved
and
you
may
believe
an
old
man
who
has
had
many
years
of
experience
and
knows
both
the
world
and
mankind
rather
than
a
set
of
scribblers
and
daubers
but
i
have
not
yet
told
you
in
detail
how
things
have
gone
with
me
today
during
the
morning
i
suffered
as
much
agony
of
spirit
as
might
have
been
experienced
in
a
year
twas
like
this
first
of
all
i
went
out
to
call
upon
the
gentleman
of
whom
i
have
spoken
i
started
very
early
before
going
to
the
office
rain
and
sleet
were
falling
and
i
hugged
myself
in
my
greatcoat
as
i
walked
along
lord
thought
i
pardon
my
offences
and
send
me
fulfilment
of
all
my
desires
and
as
i
passed
a
church
i
crossed
myself
repented
of
my
sins
and
reminded
myself
that
i
was
unworthy
to
hold
communication
with
the
lord
god
then
i
retired
into
myself
and
tried
to
look
at
nothing
and
so
walking
without
noticing
the
streets
i
proceeded
on
my
way
everything
had
an
empty
air
and
everyone
whom
i
met
looked
careworn
and
preoccupied
and
no
wonder
for
who
would
choose
to
walk
abroad
at
such
an
early
hour
and
in
such
weather
next
a
band
of
ragged
workmen
met
me
and
jostled
me
boorishly
as
they
passed
upon
which
nervousness
overtook
me
and
i
felt
uneasy
and
tried
hard
not
to
think
of
the
money
that
was
my
errand
near
the
voskresenski
bridge
my
feet
began
to
ache
with
weariness
until
i
could
hardly
pull
myself
along
until
presently
i
met
with
ermolaev
a
writer
in
our
office
who
stepping
aside
halted
and
followed
me
with
his
eyes
as
though
to
beg
of
me
a
glass
of
vodka
ah
friend
thought
i
go
you
to
your
vodka
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
such
stuff
then
sadly
weary
i
halted
for
a
moment
s
rest
and
thereafter
dragged
myself
further
on
my
way
purposely
i
kept
looking
about
me
for
something
upon
which
to
fasten
my
thoughts
with
which
to
distract
to
encourage
myself
but
there
was
nothing
not
a
single
idea
could
i
connect
with
any
given
object
while
in
addition
my
appearance
was
so
draggled
that
i
felt
utterly
ashamed
of
it
at
length
i
perceived
from
afar
a
gabled
house
that
was
built
of
yellow
wood
this
i
thought
must
be
the
residence
of
the
monsieur
markov
whom
emelia
ivanovitch
had
mentioned
to
me
as
ready
to
lend
money
on
interest
half
unconscious
of
what
i
was
doing
i
asked
a
watchman
if
he
could
tell
me
to
whom
the
house
belonged
whereupon
grudgingly
and
as
though
he
were
vexed
at
something
the
fellow
muttered
that
it
belonged
to
one
markov
are
all
watchmen
so
unfeeling
why
did
this
one
reply
as
he
did
in
any
case
i
felt
disagreeably
impressed
for
like
always
answers
to
like
and
no
matter
what
position
one
is
in
things
invariably
appear
to
correspond
to
it
three
times
did
i
pass
the
house
and
walk
the
length
of
the
street
until
the
further
i
walked
the
worse
became
my
state
of
mind
no
never
never
will
he
lend
me
anything
i
thought
to
myself
he
does
not
know
me
and
my
affairs
will
seem
to
him
ridiculous
and
i
shall
cut
a
sorry
figure
however
let
fate
decide
for
me
only
let
heaven
send
that
i
do
not
afterwards
repent
me
and
eat
out
my
heart
with
remorse
softly
i
opened
the
horrors
a
great
ragged
brute
of
a
came
flying
out
at
me
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
nearly
jumping
out
his
skin
curious
is
it
to
note
what
little
trivial
incidents
will
nearly
make
a
man
crazy
and
strike
terror
to
his
heart
and
annihilate
the
firm
purpose
with
which
he
has
armed
himself
at
all
events
i
approached
the
house
more
dead
than
alive
and
walked
straight
into
another
catastrophe
that
is
to
say
not
noticing
the
slipperiness
of
the
threshold
i
stumbled
against
an
old
woman
who
was
filling
from
a
pail
and
sent
the
milk
flying
in
every
direction
the
foolish
old
dame
gave
a
start
and
a
cry
and
then
demanded
of
me
whither
i
had
been
coming
and
what
it
was
i
wanted
after
which
she
rated
me
soundly
for
my
awkwardness
always
have
i
found
something
of
the
kind
befall
me
when
engaged
on
errands
of
this
nature
it
seems
to
be
my
destiny
invariably
to
run
into
something
upon
that
the
noise
and
the
commotion
brought
out
the
mistress
of
the
house
an
old
beldame
of
mean
appearance
i
addressed
myself
directly
to
her
does
monsieur
markov
live
here
was
my
inquiry
no
she
replied
and
then
stood
looking
at
me
civilly
enough
but
what
want
you
with
him
she
continued
upon
which
i
told
her
about
emelia
ivanovitch
and
the
rest
of
the
business
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
she
called
her
daughter
a
barefooted
girl
in
her
teens
and
told
her
to
summon
her
father
from
upstairs
meanwhile
i
was
shown
into
a
room
which
contained
several
portraits
of
generals
on
the
walls
and
was
furnished
with
a
sofa
a
large
table
and
a
few
pots
of
mignonette
and
balsam
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
come
weal
come
woe
take
myself
off
was
my
thought
as
i
waited
there
ah
how
i
longed
to
run
away
yes
i
continued
i
had
better
come
again
tomorrow
for
the
weather
may
then
be
better
and
i
shall
not
have
upset
the
milk
and
these
generals
will
not
be
looking
at
me
so
in
fact
i
had
actually
begun
to
move
towards
the
door
when
monsieur
markov
entered
a
man
with
thievish
eyes
and
clad
in
a
dirty
fastened
with
a
belt
greetings
over
i
stumbled
out
something
about
emelia
ivanovitch
and
forty
roubles
and
then
came
to
a
dead
halt
for
his
eyes
told
me
that
my
errand
had
been
futile
said
he
i
have
no
money
moreover
what
security
could
you
offer
i
admitted
that
i
could
offer
none
but
again
added
something
about
emelia
as
well
as
about
my
pressing
needs
markov
heard
me
out
and
then
repeated
that
he
had
no
money
ah
thought
i
i
might
have
known
this
i
might
have
foreseen
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
barbara
i
could
have
wished
that
the
earth
had
opened
under
my
feet
so
chilled
did
i
feel
as
he
said
what
he
did
so
numbed
did
my
legs
grow
as
shivers
began
to
run
down
my
back
thus
i
remained
gazing
at
him
while
he
returned
my
gaze
with
a
look
which
said
well
now
my
friend
why
do
you
not
go
since
you
have
no
further
business
to
do
here
somehow
i
felt
how
is
it
that
you
are
in
such
need
of
money
was
what
he
appeared
to
be
asking
whereupon
i
opened
my
mouth
anything
rather
than
stand
there
to
no
purpose
at
all
but
found
that
he
was
not
even
listening
i
have
no
money
again
he
said
or
i
would
lend
you
some
with
several
times
i
repeated
that
i
myself
possessed
a
little
and
that
i
would
repay
any
loan
from
him
punctually
most
punctually
and
that
he
might
charge
me
what
interest
he
liked
since
i
would
meet
it
without
fail
yes
at
that
moment
i
remembered
our
misfortunes
our
necessities
and
i
remembered
your
no
said
he
i
can
lend
you
nothing
without
security
and
clinched
his
assurance
with
an
oath
the
robber
how
i
contrived
to
leave
the
house
and
passing
through
viborskaia
street
to
reach
the
voskresenski
bridge
i
do
not
know
i
only
remember
that
i
felt
terribly
weary
cold
and
starved
and
that
it
was
ten
o
clock
before
i
reached
the
office
arriving
i
tried
to
clean
myself
up
a
little
but
sniegirev
the
porter
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
and
that
i
should
only
spoil
the
brush
which
belonged
to
the
government
thus
my
darling
do
such
fellows
rate
me
lower
than
the
mat
on
which
they
wipe
their
boots
what
is
it
that
will
most
surely
break
me
it
is
not
the
want
of
money
but
the
little
worries
of
life
these
whisperings
and
nods
and
jeers
any
day
his
excellency
himself
may
round
upon
me
ah
dearest
my
golden
days
are
gone
today
i
have
spent
in
reading
your
letters
through
and
the
reading
of
them
has
made
me
sad
goodbye
my
own
and
may
the
lord
watch
over
you
dievushkin
to
conceal
my
sorrow
i
would
have
written
this
letter
half
jestingly
but
the
faculty
of
jesting
has
not
been
given
me
my
one
desire
however
is
to
afford
you
pleasure
soon
i
will
come
and
see
you
dearest
without
fail
i
will
come
and
see
you
august
o
barbara
alexievna
i
am
undone
we
are
both
of
us
undone
both
of
us
are
lost
beyond
recall
everything
is
ruined
my
reputation
my
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
and
you
as
much
as
i
never
shall
we
retrieve
what
we
have
lost
i
i
have
brought
you
to
this
pass
for
i
have
become
an
outcast
my
darling
everywhere
i
am
laughed
at
and
despised
even
my
landlady
has
taken
to
abusing
me
today
she
overwhelmed
me
with
shrill
reproaches
and
abased
me
to
the
level
of
a
and
last
night
when
i
was
in
rataziaev
s
rooms
one
of
his
friends
began
to
read
a
scribbled
note
which
i
had
written
to
you
and
then
inadvertently
pulled
out
of
my
pocket
oh
beloved
what
laughter
there
arose
at
the
recital
how
those
scoundrels
mocked
and
derided
you
and
myself
i
walked
up
to
them
and
accused
rataziaev
of
breaking
faith
i
said
that
he
had
played
the
traitor
but
he
only
replied
that
i
had
been
the
betrayer
in
the
case
by
indulging
in
various
amours
you
have
kept
them
very
dark
though
lovelace
said
he
and
now
i
am
known
everywhere
by
this
name
of
they
know
everything
about
us
my
darling
everything
both
about
you
and
your
affairs
and
about
myself
and
when
today
i
was
for
sending
phaldoni
to
the
bakeshop
for
something
or
other
he
refused
to
go
saying
that
it
was
not
his
business
but
you
must
go
said
i
i
will
not
he
replied
you
have
not
paid
my
mistress
what
you
owe
her
so
i
am
not
bound
to
run
your
at
such
an
insult
from
a
raw
peasant
i
lost
my
temper
and
called
him
a
fool
to
which
he
retorted
in
a
similar
vein
upon
this
i
thought
that
he
must
be
drunk
and
told
him
so
whereupon
he
replied
what
say
you
that
i
am
suppose
you
yourself
go
and
sober
up
for
i
know
that
the
other
day
you
went
to
visit
a
woman
and
that
you
got
drunk
with
her
on
two
to
such
a
pass
have
things
come
i
feel
ashamed
to
be
seen
alive
i
am
as
it
were
a
man
proclaimed
i
am
in
a
worse
plight
even
than
a
tramp
who
has
lost
his
passport
how
misfortunes
are
heaping
themselves
upon
me
i
am
lost
i
am
lost
for
ever
august
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
it
is
true
that
misfortune
is
following
upon
misfortune
i
myself
scarcely
know
what
to
do
yet
no
matter
how
you
may
be
fairing
you
must
not
look
for
help
from
me
for
only
today
i
burned
my
left
hand
with
the
iron
at
one
and
the
same
moment
i
dropped
the
iron
made
a
mistake
in
my
work
and
burned
myself
so
now
i
can
no
longer
work
also
these
three
days
past
thedora
has
been
ailing
my
anxiety
is
becoming
positively
torturous
nevertheless
i
send
you
thirty
kopecks
almost
the
last
coins
that
i
have
left
to
me
much
as
i
should
have
liked
to
have
helped
you
more
when
you
are
so
much
in
need
i
feel
vexed
to
the
point
of
weeping
goodbye
dear
friend
of
mine
you
will
bring
me
much
comfort
if
only
you
will
come
and
see
me
today
august
what
is
the
matter
with
you
makar
alexievitch
surely
you
can
not
fear
the
lord
god
as
you
ought
to
do
you
are
not
only
driving
me
to
distraction
but
also
ruining
yourself
with
this
eternal
solicitude
for
your
reputation
you
are
a
man
of
honour
nobility
of
character
and
as
everyone
knows
yet
at
any
moment
you
are
ready
to
die
with
shame
surely
you
should
have
more
consideration
for
your
grey
hairs
no
the
fear
of
god
has
departed
from
you
thedora
has
told
you
that
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
render
you
anymore
help
see
therefore
to
what
a
pass
you
have
brought
me
probably
you
think
it
is
nothing
to
me
that
you
should
behave
so
badly
probably
you
do
not
realise
what
you
have
made
me
suffer
i
dare
not
set
foot
on
the
staircase
here
for
if
i
do
so
i
am
stared
at
and
pointed
at
and
spoken
about
in
the
most
horrible
manner
yes
it
is
even
said
of
me
that
i
am
united
to
a
what
a
thing
to
hear
and
whenever
you
are
brought
home
drunk
folk
say
they
are
carrying
in
that
that
is
not
the
proper
way
to
make
me
help
you
i
swear
that
i
must
leave
this
place
and
go
and
get
work
as
a
cook
or
a
laundress
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
stay
here
long
ago
i
wrote
and
asked
you
to
come
and
see
me
yet
you
have
not
come
truly
my
tears
and
prayers
must
mean
nothing
to
you
makar
alexievitch
whence
too
did
you
get
the
money
for
your
debauchery
for
the
love
of
god
be
more
careful
of
yourself
or
you
will
be
ruined
how
shameful
how
abominable
of
you
so
the
landlady
would
not
admit
you
last
night
and
you
spent
the
night
on
the
doorstep
oh
i
know
all
about
it
yet
if
only
you
could
have
seen
my
agony
when
i
heard
the
news
come
and
see
me
makar
alexievitch
and
we
will
once
more
be
happy
together
yes
we
will
read
together
and
talk
of
old
times
and
thedora
shall
tell
you
of
her
pilgrimages
in
former
days
for
god
s
sake
beloved
do
not
ruin
both
yourself
and
me
i
live
for
you
alone
it
is
for
your
sake
alone
that
i
am
still
here
be
your
better
self
once
more
the
self
which
still
can
remain
firm
in
the
face
of
misfortune
poverty
is
no
crime
always
remember
that
after
all
why
should
we
despair
our
present
difficulties
will
pass
away
and
god
will
right
us
only
be
brave
i
send
you
two
grivenniks
for
the
purchase
of
some
tobacco
or
anything
else
that
you
need
but
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
spend
the
money
foolishly
come
you
and
see
me
soon
come
without
fail
perhaps
you
may
be
ashamed
to
meet
me
as
you
were
before
but
you
need
not
feel
like
that
such
shame
would
be
misplaced
only
do
bring
with
you
sincere
repentance
and
trust
in
god
who
orders
all
things
for
the
best
august
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
i
am
ashamed
to
meet
you
my
darling
i
am
ashamed
at
the
same
time
what
is
there
in
all
this
why
should
we
not
be
cheerful
again
why
should
i
mind
the
soles
of
my
feet
coming
through
my
boots
the
sole
of
one
s
foot
is
a
mere
bagatelle
it
will
never
be
anything
but
just
a
base
dirty
sole
and
shoes
do
not
matter
either
the
greek
sages
used
to
walk
about
without
them
so
why
should
we
coddle
ourselves
with
such
things
yet
why
also
should
i
be
insulted
and
despised
because
of
them
tell
thedora
that
she
is
a
rubbishy
tiresome
gabbling
old
woman
as
well
as
an
inexpressibly
foolish
one
as
for
my
grey
hairs
you
are
quite
wrong
about
them
inasmuch
as
i
am
not
such
an
old
man
as
you
think
emelia
sends
you
his
greeting
you
write
that
you
are
in
great
distress
and
have
been
weeping
well
i
too
am
in
great
distress
and
have
been
weeping
nay
nay
i
wish
you
the
best
of
health
and
happiness
even
as
i
am
well
and
happy
myself
so
long
as
i
may
remain
my
darling
your
friend
makar
dievushkin
august
my
dear
and
kind
barbara
alexievna
i
feel
that
i
am
guilty
i
feel
that
i
have
sinned
against
you
yet
also
i
feel
from
what
you
say
that
it
is
no
use
for
me
so
to
feel
even
before
i
had
sinned
i
felt
as
i
do
now
but
i
gave
way
to
despair
and
the
more
so
as
recognised
my
fault
darling
i
am
not
cruel
or
hardhearted
to
rend
your
little
soul
would
be
the
act
of
a
tiger
whereas
i
have
the
heart
of
a
sheep
you
yourself
know
that
i
am
not
addicted
to
bloodthirstiness
and
therefore
that
i
can
not
really
be
guilty
of
the
fault
in
question
seeing
that
neither
my
mind
nor
my
heart
have
participated
in
it
nor
can
i
understand
wherein
the
guilt
lies
to
me
it
is
all
a
mystery
when
you
sent
me
those
thirty
kopecks
and
thereafter
those
two
grivenniks
my
heart
sank
within
me
as
i
looked
at
the
poor
little
money
to
think
that
though
you
had
burned
your
hand
and
would
soon
be
hungry
you
could
write
to
me
that
i
was
to
buy
tobacco
what
was
i
to
do
remorselessly
to
rob
you
an
orphan
as
any
brigand
might
do
i
felt
greatly
depressed
dearest
that
is
to
say
persuaded
that
i
should
never
do
any
good
with
my
life
and
that
i
was
inferior
even
to
the
sole
of
my
own
boot
i
took
it
into
my
head
that
it
was
absurd
for
me
to
aspire
at
all
rather
that
i
ought
to
account
myself
a
disgrace
and
an
abomination
once
a
man
has
lost
his
and
has
decided
to
abjure
his
better
qualities
and
human
dignity
he
falls
headlong
and
can
not
choose
but
do
so
it
is
decreed
of
fate
and
therefore
i
am
not
guilty
in
this
respect
that
evening
i
went
out
merely
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
but
one
thing
followed
another
the
weather
was
cold
all
nature
was
looking
mournful
and
i
had
fallen
in
with
emelia
this
man
had
spent
everything
that
he
possessed
and
at
the
time
i
met
him
had
not
for
two
days
tasted
a
crust
of
bread
he
had
tried
to
raise
money
by
pawning
but
what
articles
he
had
for
the
purpose
had
been
refused
by
the
pawnbrokers
it
was
more
from
sympathy
for
a
than
from
any
liking
for
the
individual
that
i
yielded
that
is
how
the
fault
arose
dearest
he
spoke
of
you
and
i
mingled
my
tears
with
his
yes
he
is
a
man
of
kind
kind
heart
a
man
of
deep
feeling
i
often
feel
as
he
did
dearest
and
in
addition
i
know
how
beholden
to
you
i
am
as
soon
as
ever
i
got
to
know
you
i
began
both
to
realise
myself
and
to
love
you
for
until
you
came
into
my
life
i
had
been
a
lonely
man
i
had
been
as
it
were
asleep
rather
than
alive
in
former
days
my
rascally
colleagues
used
to
tell
me
that
i
was
unfit
even
to
be
seen
in
fact
they
so
disliked
me
that
at
length
i
began
to
dislike
myself
for
being
frequently
told
that
i
was
stupid
i
began
to
believe
that
i
really
was
so
but
the
instant
that
you
came
into
my
life
you
lightened
the
dark
places
in
it
you
lightened
both
my
heart
and
my
soul
gradually
i
gained
rest
of
spirit
until
i
had
come
to
see
that
i
was
no
worse
than
other
men
and
that
though
i
had
neither
style
nor
brilliancy
nor
polish
i
was
still
a
man
as
regards
my
thoughts
and
feelings
but
now
alas
pursued
and
scorned
of
fate
i
have
again
allowed
myself
to
abjure
my
own
dignity
oppressed
of
misfortune
i
have
lost
my
courage
here
is
my
confession
to
you
dearest
with
tears
i
beseech
you
not
to
inquire
further
into
the
matter
for
my
heart
is
breaking
and
life
has
grown
indeed
hard
and
bitter
for
me
beloved
i
offer
you
my
respect
and
remain
ever
your
faithful
friend
makar
dievushkin
september
the
reason
why
i
did
not
finish
my
last
letter
makar
alexievitch
was
that
i
found
it
so
difficult
to
write
there
are
moments
when
i
am
glad
to
be
alone
to
grieve
and
repine
without
any
one
to
share
my
sorrow
and
those
moments
are
beginning
to
come
upon
me
with
frequency
always
in
my
reminiscences
i
find
something
which
is
inexplicable
yet
strongly
attractive
so
much
so
that
for
hours
together
i
remain
insensible
to
my
surroundings
oblivious
of
reality
indeed
in
my
present
life
there
is
not
a
single
impression
that
i
encounter
pleasant
or
the
reverse
which
does
not
recall
to
my
mind
something
of
a
similar
nature
in
the
past
more
particularly
is
this
the
case
with
regard
to
my
childhood
my
golden
childhood
yet
such
moments
always
leave
me
depressed
they
render
me
weak
and
exhaust
my
powers
of
fancy
with
the
result
that
my
health
already
not
good
grows
steadily
worse
however
this
morning
it
is
a
fine
fresh
cloudless
day
such
as
we
seldom
get
in
autumn
the
air
has
revived
me
and
i
greet
it
with
joy
yet
to
think
that
already
the
fall
of
the
year
has
come
how
i
used
to
love
the
country
in
autumn
then
but
a
child
i
was
yet
a
sensitive
being
who
loved
autumn
evenings
better
than
autumn
mornings
i
remember
how
beside
our
house
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
there
lay
a
large
pond
and
how
the
pond
i
can
see
it
even
now
shone
with
a
broad
level
surface
that
was
as
clear
as
crystal
on
still
evenings
this
pond
would
be
at
rest
and
not
a
rustle
would
disturb
the
trees
which
grew
on
its
banks
and
overhung
the
motionless
expanse
of
water
how
fresh
it
used
to
seem
yet
how
cold
the
dew
would
be
falling
upon
the
turf
lights
would
be
beginning
to
shine
forth
from
the
huts
on
the
pond
s
margin
and
the
cattle
would
be
wending
their
way
home
then
quietly
i
would
slip
out
of
the
house
to
look
at
my
beloved
pond
and
forget
myself
in
contemplation
here
and
there
a
fisherman
s
bundle
of
brushwood
would
be
burning
at
the
water
s
edge
and
sending
its
light
far
and
wide
over
the
surface
above
the
sky
would
be
of
a
cold
blue
colour
save
for
a
fringe
of
streaks
on
the
horizon
that
kept
turning
ever
paler
and
paler
and
when
the
moon
had
come
out
there
would
be
wafted
through
the
limpid
air
the
sounds
of
a
frightened
bird
fluttering
of
a
bulrush
rubbing
against
its
fellows
in
the
gentle
breeze
and
of
a
fish
rising
with
a
splash
over
the
dark
water
there
would
gather
a
thin
transparent
mist
and
though
in
the
distance
night
would
be
looming
and
seemingly
enveloping
the
entire
horizon
everything
closer
at
hand
would
be
standing
out
as
though
shaped
with
a
chisel
banks
boats
little
islands
and
all
beside
the
margin
a
derelict
barrel
would
be
turning
over
and
over
in
the
water
a
switch
of
laburnum
with
yellowing
leaves
would
go
meandering
through
the
reeds
and
a
belated
gull
would
flutter
up
dive
again
into
the
cold
depths
rise
once
more
and
disappear
into
the
mist
how
i
would
watch
and
listen
to
these
things
how
strangely
good
they
all
would
seem
but
i
was
a
mere
infant
in
those
days
a
mere
child
yes
truly
i
loved
the
late
autumn
when
the
crops
are
garnered
and
field
work
is
ended
and
the
evening
gatherings
in
the
huts
have
begun
and
everyone
is
awaiting
winter
then
does
everything
become
more
mysterious
the
sky
frowns
with
clouds
yellow
leaves
strew
the
paths
at
the
edge
of
the
naked
forest
and
the
forest
itself
turns
black
and
blue
more
especially
at
eventide
when
damp
fog
is
spreading
and
the
trees
glimmer
in
the
depths
like
giants
like
formless
weird
phantoms
perhaps
one
may
be
out
late
and
had
got
separated
from
one
s
companions
oh
horrors
suddenly
one
starts
and
trembles
as
one
seems
to
see
a
being
peering
from
out
of
the
darkness
of
a
hollow
tree
while
all
the
while
the
wind
is
moaning
and
rattling
and
howling
through
the
forest
moaning
with
a
hungry
sound
as
it
strips
the
leaves
from
the
bare
boughs
and
whirls
them
into
the
air
high
over
the
in
a
widespread
trailing
noisy
crew
there
fly
with
resounding
cries
flocks
of
birds
which
seem
to
darken
and
overlay
the
very
heavens
then
a
strange
feeling
comes
over
one
until
one
seems
to
hear
the
voice
of
some
one
whispering
run
run
little
child
do
not
be
out
late
for
this
place
will
soon
have
become
dreadful
run
little
child
run
and
at
the
words
terror
will
possess
one
s
soul
and
one
will
rush
and
rush
until
one
s
breath
is
spent
until
panting
one
has
reached
home
at
home
however
all
will
look
bright
and
bustling
as
we
children
are
set
to
shell
peas
or
poppies
and
the
damp
twigs
crackle
in
the
stove
and
our
mother
comes
to
look
fondly
at
our
work
and
our
old
nurse
iliana
tells
us
stories
of
bygone
days
or
terrible
legends
concerning
wizards
and
dead
men
at
the
recital
we
little
ones
will
press
closer
to
one
another
yet
smile
as
we
do
so
when
suddenly
everyone
becomes
silent
surely
somebody
has
knocked
at
the
door
but
nay
nay
it
is
only
the
sound
of
frolovna
s
what
shouts
of
laughter
arise
later
one
will
be
unable
to
sleep
for
fear
of
the
strange
dreams
which
come
to
visit
one
or
if
one
falls
asleep
one
will
soon
wake
again
and
afraid
to
stir
lie
quaking
under
the
coverlet
until
dawn
and
in
the
morning
one
will
arise
as
fresh
as
a
lark
and
look
at
the
window
and
see
the
fields
overlaid
with
hoarfrost
and
fine
icicles
hanging
from
the
naked
branches
and
the
pond
covered
over
with
ice
as
thin
as
paper
and
a
white
steam
rising
from
the
surface
and
birds
flying
overhead
with
cheerful
cries
next
as
the
sun
rises
he
throws
his
glittering
beams
everywhere
and
melts
the
thin
glassy
ice
until
the
whole
scene
has
come
to
look
bright
and
clear
and
exhilarating
and
as
the
fire
begins
to
crackle
again
in
the
stove
we
sit
down
to
the
while
chilled
with
the
night
cold
our
black
dog
polkan
will
look
in
at
us
through
the
window
and
wag
his
tail
with
a
cheerful
air
presently
a
peasant
will
pass
the
window
in
his
cart
bound
for
the
forest
to
cut
firewood
and
the
whole
party
will
feel
merry
and
contented
together
abundant
grain
lies
stored
in
the
byres
and
great
stacks
of
wheat
are
glowing
comfortably
in
the
morning
sunlight
everyone
is
quiet
and
happy
for
god
has
blessed
us
with
a
bounteous
harvest
and
we
know
that
there
will
be
abundance
of
food
for
the
wintertide
yes
the
peasant
may
rest
assured
that
his
family
will
not
want
for
aught
song
and
dance
will
arise
at
night
from
the
village
girls
and
on
festival
days
everyone
will
repair
to
god
s
house
to
thank
him
with
grateful
tears
for
what
he
has
done
ah
a
golden
time
was
my
time
of
childhood
carried
away
by
these
memories
i
could
weep
like
a
child
everything
everything
comes
back
so
clearly
to
my
recollection
the
past
stands
out
so
vividly
before
me
yet
in
the
present
everything
looks
dim
and
dark
how
will
it
all
end
how
do
you
know
i
have
a
feeling
a
sort
of
sure
premonition
that
i
am
going
to
die
this
coming
autumn
for
i
feel
terribly
oh
so
terribly
ill
often
do
i
think
of
death
yet
feel
that
i
should
not
like
to
die
here
and
be
laid
to
rest
in
the
soil
of
petersburg
once
more
i
have
had
to
take
to
my
bed
as
i
did
last
spring
for
i
have
never
really
recovered
indeed
i
feel
so
depressed
thedora
has
gone
out
for
the
day
and
i
am
alone
for
a
long
while
past
i
have
been
afraid
to
be
left
by
myself
for
i
keep
fancying
that
there
is
someone
else
in
the
room
and
that
that
someone
is
speaking
to
me
especially
do
i
fancy
this
when
i
have
gone
off
into
a
reverie
and
then
suddenly
awoken
from
it
and
am
feeling
bewildered
that
is
why
i
have
made
this
letter
such
a
long
one
for
when
i
am
writing
the
mood
passes
away
goodbye
i
have
neither
time
nor
paper
left
for
more
and
must
close
of
the
money
which
i
saved
to
buy
a
new
dress
and
hat
there
remains
but
a
single
rouble
but
i
am
glad
that
you
have
been
able
to
pay
your
landlady
two
roubles
for
they
will
keep
her
tongue
quiet
for
a
time
and
you
must
repair
your
wardrobe
goodbye
once
more
i
am
so
tired
nor
can
i
think
why
i
am
growing
so
weak
why
it
is
that
even
the
smallest
task
now
wearies
me
even
if
work
should
come
my
way
how
am
i
to
do
it
that
is
what
worries
me
above
all
things
september
my
beloved
barbara
today
i
have
undergone
a
variety
of
experiences
in
the
first
place
my
head
has
been
aching
and
towards
evening
i
went
out
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
along
the
fontanka
canal
the
weather
was
dull
and
damp
and
even
by
six
o
clock
darkness
had
begun
to
set
in
true
rain
was
not
actually
falling
but
only
a
mist
like
rain
while
the
sky
was
streaked
with
masses
of
trailing
cloud
crowds
of
people
were
hurrying
along
naberezhnaia
street
with
faces
that
looked
strange
and
dejected
there
were
drunken
peasants
old
harridans
in
slippers
bareheaded
artisans
cab
drivers
every
species
of
beggar
boys
a
locksmith
s
apprentice
in
a
striped
smock
with
lean
emaciated
features
which
seemed
to
have
been
washed
in
rancid
oil
an
who
was
offering
penknives
and
copper
rings
for
sale
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
was
the
hour
when
one
would
expect
to
meet
no
other
folk
than
these
and
what
a
quantity
of
boats
there
were
on
the
canal
it
made
one
wonder
how
they
could
all
find
room
there
on
every
bridge
were
old
women
selling
damp
gingerbread
or
withered
apples
and
every
woman
looked
as
damp
and
dirty
as
her
wares
in
short
the
fontanka
is
a
saddening
spot
for
a
walk
for
there
is
wet
granite
under
one
s
feet
and
tall
dingy
buildings
on
either
side
of
one
and
wet
mist
below
and
wet
mist
above
yes
all
was
dark
and
gloomy
there
this
evening
by
the
time
i
had
returned
to
gorokhovaia
street
darkness
had
fallen
and
the
lamps
had
been
lit
however
i
did
not
linger
long
in
that
particular
spot
for
gorokhovaia
street
is
too
noisy
a
place
but
what
sumptuous
shops
and
stores
it
contains
everything
sparkles
and
glitters
and
the
windows
are
full
of
nothing
but
bright
colours
and
materials
and
hats
of
different
shapes
one
might
think
that
they
were
decked
merely
for
display
but
no
people
buy
these
things
and
give
them
to
their
wives
yes
it
is
a
sumptuous
place
hordes
of
german
hucksters
are
there
as
well
as
quite
respectable
traders
and
the
quantities
of
carriages
which
pass
along
the
street
one
marvels
that
the
pavement
can
support
so
many
splendid
vehicles
with
windows
like
crystal
linings
made
of
silk
and
velvet
and
lacqueys
dressed
in
epaulets
and
wearing
swords
into
some
of
them
i
glanced
and
saw
that
they
contained
ladies
of
various
ages
perhaps
they
were
princesses
and
countesses
probably
at
that
hour
such
folk
would
be
hastening
to
balls
and
other
gatherings
in
fact
it
was
interesting
to
be
able
to
look
so
closely
at
a
princess
or
a
great
lady
they
were
all
very
fine
at
all
events
i
had
never
before
seen
such
persons
as
i
beheld
in
those
carriages
then
i
thought
of
you
ah
my
own
my
darling
it
is
often
that
i
think
of
you
and
feel
my
heart
sink
how
is
it
that
you
are
so
unfortunate
barbara
how
is
it
that
you
are
so
much
worse
off
than
other
people
in
my
eyes
you
are
beautiful
and
clever
why
then
has
such
an
evil
fate
fallen
to
your
lot
how
comes
it
that
you
are
left
desolate
you
so
good
a
human
being
while
to
others
happiness
comes
without
an
invitation
at
all
yes
i
know
i
know
it
well
that
i
ought
not
to
say
it
for
to
do
so
savours
of
but
why
should
that
raven
fate
croak
out
upon
the
fortunes
of
one
person
while
she
is
yet
in
her
mother
s
womb
while
another
person
it
permits
to
go
forth
in
happiness
from
the
home
which
has
reared
her
to
even
an
idiot
of
an
ivanushka
such
happiness
is
sometimes
granted
you
you
fool
ivanushka
says
fate
shall
succeed
to
your
grandfather
s
and
eat
drink
and
be
merry
whereas
you
such
and
such
another
one
shall
do
no
more
than
lick
the
dish
since
that
is
all
that
you
are
good
yes
i
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
hold
such
opinions
but
involuntarily
the
sin
of
so
doing
grows
upon
one
s
soul
nevertheless
it
is
you
my
darling
who
ought
to
be
riding
in
one
of
those
carriages
generals
would
have
come
seeking
your
favour
and
instead
of
being
clad
in
a
humble
cotton
dress
you
would
have
been
walking
in
silken
and
golden
attire
then
you
would
not
have
been
thin
and
wan
as
now
but
fresh
and
plump
and
as
a
figure
on
a
then
should
i
too
have
been
happy
happy
if
only
i
could
look
at
your
lighted
windows
from
the
street
and
watch
your
shadow
happy
if
only
i
could
think
that
you
were
well
and
happy
my
sweet
little
bird
yet
how
are
things
in
reality
not
only
have
evil
folk
brought
you
to
ruin
but
there
comes
also
an
old
rascal
of
a
libertine
to
insult
you
just
because
he
struts
about
in
a
frockcoat
and
can
ogle
you
through
a
lorgnette
the
brute
thinks
that
everything
will
fall
into
his
hands
that
you
are
bound
to
listen
to
his
insulting
condescension
out
upon
him
but
why
is
this
it
is
because
you
are
an
orphan
it
is
because
you
are
unprotected
it
is
because
you
have
no
powerful
friend
to
afford
you
the
decent
support
which
is
your
due
what
do
such
facts
matter
to
a
man
or
to
men
to
whom
the
insulting
of
an
orphan
is
an
offence
allowed
such
fellows
are
not
men
at
all
but
mere
vermin
no
matter
what
they
think
themselves
to
be
of
that
i
am
certain
why
an
whom
i
met
in
gorokhovaia
street
would
inspire
more
respect
than
they
do
for
at
least
he
walks
about
all
day
and
suffers
hunger
at
least
he
looks
for
a
stray
superfluous
groat
to
earn
him
subsistence
and
is
therefore
a
true
gentleman
in
that
he
supports
himself
to
beg
alms
he
would
be
ashamed
and
moreover
he
works
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
just
as
does
a
factory
machine
so
far
as
in
me
lies
says
he
i
will
give
you
true
he
is
a
pauper
and
nothing
but
a
pauper
but
at
least
he
is
an
honourable
pauper
though
tired
and
hungry
he
still
goes
on
working
working
in
his
own
peculiar
fashion
yet
still
doing
honest
labour
yes
many
a
decent
fellow
whose
labour
may
be
disproportionate
to
its
utility
pulls
the
forelock
to
no
one
and
begs
his
bread
of
no
one
i
myself
resemble
that
that
is
to
say
though
not
exactly
he
i
resemble
him
in
this
respect
that
i
work
according
to
my
capabilities
and
so
far
as
in
me
lies
more
could
be
asked
of
no
one
nor
ought
i
to
be
adjudged
to
do
more
apropos
of
the
i
may
tell
you
dearest
that
today
i
experienced
a
double
misfortune
as
i
was
looking
at
the
grinder
certain
thoughts
entered
my
head
and
i
stood
wrapped
in
a
reverie
some
cabmen
also
had
halted
at
the
spot
as
well
as
a
young
girl
with
a
yet
smaller
girl
who
was
dressed
in
rags
and
tatters
these
people
had
halted
there
to
listen
to
the
who
was
playing
in
front
of
some
one
s
windows
next
i
caught
sight
of
a
little
urchin
of
about
ten
a
boy
who
would
have
been
but
for
the
fact
that
his
face
was
pinched
and
sickly
almost
barefooted
and
clad
only
in
a
shirt
he
was
standing
agape
to
listen
to
the
music
a
pitiful
childish
figure
nearer
to
the
grinder
a
few
more
urchins
were
dancing
but
in
the
case
of
this
lad
his
hands
and
feet
looked
numbed
and
he
kept
biting
the
end
of
his
sleeve
and
shivering
also
i
noticed
that
in
his
hands
he
had
a
paper
of
some
sort
presently
a
gentleman
came
by
and
tossed
the
grinder
a
small
coin
which
fell
straight
into
a
box
adorned
with
a
representation
of
a
frenchman
and
some
ladies
the
instant
he
heard
the
rattle
of
the
coin
the
boy
started
looked
timidly
round
and
evidently
made
up
his
mind
that
i
had
thrown
the
money
whereupon
he
ran
to
me
with
his
little
hands
all
shaking
and
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
as
he
proffered
me
his
paper
sign
i
turned
over
the
paper
and
saw
that
there
was
written
on
it
what
is
usual
under
such
circumstances
kind
friends
i
am
a
sick
mother
with
three
hungry
children
pray
help
me
though
soon
i
shall
be
dead
yet
if
you
will
not
forget
my
little
ones
in
this
world
neither
will
i
forget
you
in
the
world
that
is
to
the
thing
seemed
clear
enough
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
yet
what
was
i
to
give
the
lad
well
i
gave
him
nothing
but
my
heart
ached
for
him
i
am
certain
that
shivering
with
cold
though
he
was
and
perhaps
hungry
the
poor
lad
was
not
lying
no
no
he
was
not
lying
the
shameful
point
is
that
so
many
mothers
take
no
care
of
their
children
but
send
them
out
into
the
cold
perhaps
this
lad
s
mother
also
was
a
feckless
old
woman
and
devoid
of
character
or
perhaps
she
had
no
one
to
work
for
her
but
was
forced
to
sit
with
her
legs
crossed
a
veritable
invalid
or
perhaps
she
was
just
an
old
rogue
who
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
out
pinched
and
hungry
boys
to
deceive
the
public
what
would
such
a
boy
learn
from
begging
letters
his
heart
would
soon
be
rendered
callous
for
as
he
ran
about
begging
people
would
pass
him
by
and
give
him
nothing
yes
their
hearts
would
be
as
stone
and
their
replies
rough
and
harsh
away
with
you
they
would
say
you
are
seeking
but
to
trick
he
would
hear
that
from
every
one
and
his
heart
would
grow
hard
and
he
would
shiver
in
vain
with
the
cold
like
some
poor
little
fledgling
that
has
fallen
out
of
the
nest
his
hands
and
feet
would
be
freezing
and
his
breath
coming
with
difficulty
until
look
you
he
would
begin
to
cough
and
disease
like
an
unclean
parasite
would
worm
its
way
into
his
breast
until
death
itself
had
overtaken
him
overtaken
him
in
some
foetid
corner
whence
there
was
no
chance
of
escape
yes
that
is
what
his
life
would
become
there
are
many
such
cases
ah
barbara
it
is
hard
to
hear
for
christ
s
sake
and
yet
pass
the
suppliant
by
and
give
nothing
or
say
merely
may
the
lord
give
unto
you
of
course
some
supplications
mean
nothing
for
supplications
differ
greatly
in
character
occasionally
supplications
are
long
and
drawling
stereotyped
and
mechanical
they
are
purely
begging
supplications
requests
of
this
kind
it
is
less
hard
to
refuse
for
they
are
purely
professional
and
of
long
standing
the
beggar
is
overdoing
it
one
thinks
to
oneself
he
knows
the
trick
too
but
there
are
other
supplications
which
voice
a
strange
hoarse
unaccustomed
note
like
that
today
when
i
took
the
poor
boy
s
paper
he
had
been
standing
by
the
kerbstone
without
speaking
to
anybody
save
that
at
last
to
myself
he
said
for
the
love
of
christ
give
me
a
groat
in
a
voice
so
hoarse
and
broken
that
i
started
and
felt
a
queer
sensation
in
my
heart
although
i
did
not
give
him
a
groat
indeed
i
had
not
a
groat
on
me
rich
folk
dislike
hearing
poor
people
complain
of
their
poverty
they
disturb
us
they
say
and
are
impertinent
as
well
why
should
poverty
be
so
impertinent
why
should
its
hungry
moans
prevent
us
from
sleeping
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
darling
i
have
written
the
foregoing
not
merely
to
relieve
my
feelings
but
also
still
more
to
give
you
an
example
of
the
excellent
style
in
which
i
can
write
you
yourself
will
recognise
that
my
style
was
formed
long
ago
but
of
late
such
fits
of
despondency
have
seized
upon
me
that
my
style
has
begun
to
correspond
to
my
feelings
and
though
i
know
that
such
correspondence
gains
one
little
it
at
least
renders
one
a
certain
justice
for
not
unfrequently
it
happens
that
for
some
reason
or
another
one
feels
abased
and
inclined
to
value
oneself
at
nothing
and
to
account
oneself
lower
than
a
dishclout
but
this
merely
arises
from
the
fact
that
at
the
time
one
is
feeling
harassed
and
depressed
like
the
poor
boy
who
today
asked
of
me
alms
let
me
tell
you
an
allegory
dearest
and
do
you
hearken
to
it
often
as
i
hasten
to
the
office
in
the
morning
i
look
around
me
at
the
city
i
watch
it
awaking
getting
out
of
bed
lighting
its
fires
cooking
its
breakfast
and
becoming
vocal
and
at
the
sight
i
begin
to
feel
smaller
as
though
some
one
had
dealt
me
a
rap
on
my
inquisitive
nose
yes
at
such
times
i
slink
along
with
a
sense
of
utter
humiliation
in
my
heart
for
one
would
have
but
to
see
what
is
passing
within
those
great
black
grimy
houses
of
the
capital
and
to
penetrate
within
their
walls
for
one
at
once
to
realise
what
good
reason
there
is
for
and
of
course
you
will
note
that
i
am
speaking
figuratively
rather
than
literally
let
us
look
at
what
is
passing
within
those
houses
in
some
dingy
corner
perhaps
in
some
damp
kennel
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
room
an
artisan
has
just
awakened
from
sleep
all
night
he
has
dreamt
if
such
an
insignificant
fellow
is
capable
of
dreaming
about
the
shoes
which
last
night
he
mechanically
cut
out
he
is
a
you
see
and
therefore
able
to
think
of
nothing
but
his
one
subject
of
interest
nearby
are
some
squalling
children
and
a
hungry
wife
nor
is
he
the
only
man
that
has
to
greet
the
day
in
this
fashion
indeed
the
incident
would
be
nothing
it
would
not
be
worth
writing
about
save
for
another
circumstance
in
that
same
house
another
person
a
person
of
great
also
have
been
dreaming
of
shoes
but
of
shoes
of
a
very
different
pattern
and
fashion
in
a
manner
of
speaking
if
you
understand
my
metaphor
we
are
all
of
us
shoemakers
this
again
would
be
nothing
were
it
not
that
the
rich
person
has
no
one
to
whisper
in
his
ear
why
dost
thou
think
of
such
things
why
dost
thou
think
of
thyself
alone
and
live
only
for
thyself
thou
who
art
not
a
shoemaker
thy
children
are
not
ailing
thy
wife
is
not
hungry
look
around
thee
can
st
thou
not
find
a
subject
more
fitting
for
thy
thoughts
than
thy
shoes
that
is
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
in
allegorical
language
barbara
maybe
it
savours
a
little
of
dearest
but
such
ideas
will
keep
arising
in
my
mind
and
finding
utterance
in
impetuous
speech
why
therefore
should
one
not
value
oneself
at
a
groat
as
one
listens
in
fear
and
trembling
to
the
roar
and
turmoil
of
the
city
maybe
you
think
that
i
am
exaggerating
things
that
this
is
a
mere
whim
of
mine
or
that
i
am
quoting
from
a
book
no
no
barbara
you
may
rest
assured
that
it
is
not
so
exaggeration
i
abhor
with
whims
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
of
quotation
i
am
guiltless
i
arrived
home
today
in
a
melancholy
mood
sitting
down
to
the
table
i
had
warmed
myself
some
tea
and
was
about
to
drink
a
second
glass
of
it
when
there
entered
gorshkov
the
poor
lodger
already
this
morning
i
had
noticed
that
he
was
hovering
around
the
other
lodgers
and
also
seeming
to
want
to
speak
to
myself
in
passing
i
may
say
that
his
circumstances
are
infinitely
worse
than
my
own
for
only
think
of
it
he
has
a
wife
and
children
indeed
if
i
were
he
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
well
he
entered
my
room
and
bowed
to
me
with
the
pus
standing
as
usual
in
drops
on
his
eyelashes
his
feet
shuffling
about
and
his
tongue
unable
at
first
to
articulate
a
word
i
motioned
him
to
a
chair
it
was
a
dilapidated
enough
one
but
i
had
no
other
and
asked
him
to
have
a
glass
of
tea
to
this
he
demurred
for
quite
a
long
time
he
demurred
but
at
length
he
accepted
the
offer
next
he
was
for
drinking
the
tea
without
sugar
and
renewed
his
excuses
but
upon
the
sugar
i
insisted
after
long
resistance
and
many
refusals
he
did
consent
to
take
some
but
only
the
smallest
possible
lump
after
which
he
assured
me
that
his
tea
was
perfectly
sweet
to
what
depths
of
humility
can
poverty
reduce
a
man
well
what
is
it
my
good
sir
i
inquired
of
him
whereupon
he
replied
it
is
this
makar
alexievitch
you
have
once
before
been
my
benefactor
pray
again
show
me
the
charity
of
god
and
assist
my
unfortunate
family
my
wife
and
children
have
nothing
to
eat
to
think
that
a
father
should
have
to
say
this
i
was
about
to
speak
again
when
he
interrupted
me
you
see
he
continued
i
am
afraid
of
the
other
lodgers
here
that
is
to
say
i
am
not
so
much
afraid
of
as
ashamed
to
address
them
for
they
are
a
proud
conceited
lot
of
men
nor
would
i
have
troubled
even
you
my
friend
and
former
benefactor
were
it
not
that
i
know
that
you
yourself
have
experienced
misfortune
and
are
in
debt
wherefore
i
have
ventured
to
come
and
make
this
request
of
you
in
that
i
know
you
not
only
to
be
but
also
to
be
in
need
and
for
that
reason
the
more
likely
to
sympathise
with
me
in
my
to
this
he
added
an
apology
for
his
awkwardness
and
presumption
i
replied
that
glad
though
i
should
have
been
to
serve
him
i
had
nothing
absolutely
nothing
at
my
disposal
ah
makar
alexievitch
he
went
on
surely
it
is
not
much
that
i
am
asking
of
you
wife
and
children
are
starving
you
not
afford
me
just
a
grivennik
at
that
my
heart
contracted
how
these
people
put
me
to
shame
thought
i
but
i
had
only
twenty
kopecks
left
and
upon
them
i
had
been
counting
for
meeting
my
most
pressing
requirements
no
good
sir
i
can
not
said
i
well
what
you
will
he
persisted
perhaps
ten
kopecks
well
i
got
out
my
and
gave
him
the
twenty
it
was
a
good
deed
to
think
that
such
poverty
should
exist
then
i
had
some
further
talk
with
him
how
is
it
i
asked
him
that
though
you
are
in
such
straits
you
have
hired
a
room
at
five
roubles
he
replied
that
though
when
he
engaged
the
room
six
months
ago
he
paid
three
months
rent
in
advance
his
affairs
had
subsequently
turned
out
badly
and
never
righted
themselves
since
you
see
barbara
he
was
sued
at
law
by
a
merchant
who
had
defrauded
the
treasury
in
the
matter
of
a
contract
when
the
fraud
was
discovered
the
merchant
was
prosecuted
but
the
transactions
in
which
he
had
engaged
involved
gorshkov
although
the
latter
had
been
guilty
only
of
negligence
want
of
prudence
and
culpable
indifference
to
the
treasury
s
interests
true
the
affair
had
taken
place
some
years
ago
but
various
obstacles
had
since
combined
to
thwart
gorshkov
of
the
disgrace
put
upon
me
said
he
to
me
i
am
innocent
true
i
to
a
certain
extent
disobeyed
orders
but
never
did
i
commit
theft
or
nevertheless
the
affair
lost
him
his
character
he
was
dismissed
the
service
and
though
not
adjudged
capitally
guilty
has
been
unable
since
to
recover
from
the
merchant
a
large
sum
of
money
which
is
his
by
right
as
spared
to
him
gorshkov
by
the
legal
tribunal
true
the
tribunal
in
question
did
not
altogether
believe
in
gorshkov
but
i
do
so
the
matter
is
of
a
nature
so
complex
and
crooked
that
probably
a
hundred
years
would
be
insufficient
to
unravel
it
and
though
it
has
now
to
a
certain
extent
been
cleared
up
the
merchant
still
holds
the
key
to
the
situation
personally
i
side
with
gorshkov
and
am
very
sorry
for
him
though
lacking
a
post
of
any
kind
he
still
refuses
to
despair
though
his
resources
are
completely
exhausted
yes
it
is
a
tangled
affair
and
meanwhile
he
must
live
for
unfortunately
another
child
which
has
been
born
to
him
has
entailed
upon
the
family
fresh
expenses
also
another
of
his
children
recently
fell
ill
and
died
which
meant
yet
further
expense
lastly
not
only
is
his
wife
in
bad
health
but
he
himself
is
suffering
from
a
complaint
of
long
standing
in
short
he
has
had
a
very
great
deal
to
undergo
yet
he
declares
that
daily
he
expects
a
favourable
issue
to
his
affair
that
he
has
no
doubt
of
it
whatever
i
am
terribly
sorry
for
him
and
said
what
i
could
to
give
him
comfort
for
he
is
a
man
who
has
been
much
bullied
and
misled
he
had
come
to
me
for
protection
from
his
troubles
so
i
did
my
best
to
soothe
him
now
goodbye
my
darling
may
christ
watch
over
you
and
preserve
your
health
dearest
one
even
to
think
of
you
is
like
medicine
to
my
ailing
soul
though
i
suffer
for
you
i
at
least
suffer
your
true
friend
makar
dievushkin
september
my
dearest
barbara
alexievna
i
am
beside
myself
as
i
take
up
my
pen
for
a
most
terrible
thing
has
happened
my
head
is
whirling
round
ah
beloved
how
am
i
to
tell
you
about
it
all
i
had
never
foreseen
what
has
happened
but
no
i
can
not
say
that
i
had
never
foreseen
it
for
my
mind
did
get
an
inkling
of
what
was
coming
through
my
seeing
something
very
similar
to
it
in
a
dream
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
simply
and
as
god
may
put
it
into
my
heart
today
i
went
to
the
office
as
usual
and
upon
arrival
sat
down
to
write
you
must
know
that
i
had
been
engaged
on
the
same
sort
of
work
yesterday
and
that
while
executing
it
i
had
been
approached
by
timothei
ivanovitch
with
an
urgent
request
for
a
particular
document
makar
alexievitch
he
had
said
pray
copy
this
out
for
me
copy
it
as
quickly
and
as
carefully
as
you
can
for
it
will
require
to
be
signed
also
let
me
tell
you
dearest
that
yesterday
i
had
not
been
feeling
myself
nor
able
to
look
at
anything
i
had
been
troubled
with
grave
depression
my
breast
had
felt
chilled
and
my
head
clouded
all
the
while
i
had
been
thinking
of
you
my
darling
well
i
set
to
work
upon
the
copying
and
executed
it
cleanly
and
well
except
for
the
fact
that
whether
the
devil
confused
my
mind
or
a
mysterious
fate
so
ordained
or
the
occurrence
was
simply
bound
to
happen
i
left
out
a
whole
line
of
the
document
and
thus
made
nonsense
of
it
the
work
had
been
given
me
too
late
for
signature
last
night
so
it
went
before
his
excellency
this
morning
i
reached
the
office
at
my
usual
hour
and
sat
down
beside
emelia
ivanovitch
here
i
may
remark
that
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
been
feeling
twice
as
shy
and
diffident
as
i
used
to
do
i
have
been
finding
it
impossible
to
look
people
in
the
face
let
only
a
chair
creak
and
i
become
more
dead
than
alive
today
therefore
i
crept
humbly
to
my
seat
and
sat
down
in
such
a
crouching
posture
that
efim
akimovitch
the
most
touchy
man
in
the
world
said
to
me
sotto
voce
what
on
earth
makes
you
sit
like
that
makar
alexievitch
then
he
pulled
such
a
grimace
that
everyone
near
us
rocked
with
laughter
at
my
expense
i
stopped
my
ears
frowned
and
sat
without
moving
for
i
found
this
the
best
method
of
putting
a
stop
to
such
merriment
all
at
once
i
heard
a
bustle
and
a
commotion
and
the
sound
of
someone
running
towards
us
did
my
ears
deceive
me
it
was
i
who
was
being
summoned
in
peremptory
tones
my
heart
started
to
tremble
within
me
though
i
could
not
say
why
i
only
know
that
never
in
my
life
before
had
it
trembled
as
it
did
then
still
i
clung
to
my
chair
and
at
that
moment
was
hardly
myself
at
all
the
voices
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
until
they
were
shouting
in
my
ear
dievushkin
dievushkin
where
is
dievushkin
then
at
length
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
before
me
evstafi
ivanovitch
he
said
to
me
makar
alexievitch
go
at
once
to
his
excellency
you
have
made
a
mistake
in
a
that
was
all
but
it
was
enough
was
it
not
i
felt
dead
and
cold
as
ice
i
felt
absolutely
deprived
of
the
power
of
sensation
but
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
went
whither
i
had
been
bidden
through
one
room
through
two
rooms
through
three
rooms
i
passed
until
i
was
conducted
into
his
excellency
s
cabinet
itself
of
my
thoughts
at
that
moment
i
can
give
no
exact
account
i
merely
saw
his
excellency
standing
before
me
with
a
knot
of
people
around
him
i
have
an
idea
that
i
did
not
salute
him
that
i
forgot
to
do
so
indeed
so
was
i
that
my
teeth
were
chattering
and
my
knees
knocking
together
in
the
first
place
i
was
greatly
ashamed
of
my
appearance
a
glance
into
a
mirror
on
the
right
had
frightened
me
with
the
reflection
of
myself
that
it
presented
and
in
the
second
place
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
comport
myself
as
though
no
such
person
as
i
existed
probably
his
excellency
had
never
before
known
that
i
was
even
alive
of
course
he
might
have
heard
in
passing
that
there
was
a
man
named
dievushkin
in
his
department
but
never
for
a
moment
had
he
had
any
intercourse
with
me
he
began
angrily
what
is
this
you
have
done
sir
why
are
you
not
more
careful
the
document
was
wanted
in
a
hurry
and
you
have
gone
and
spoiled
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
last
being
addressed
to
evstafi
ivanovitch
more
i
did
not
hear
except
for
some
flying
exclamations
of
what
negligence
and
carelessness
how
awkward
this
is
and
so
on
i
opened
my
mouth
to
say
something
or
other
i
tried
to
beg
pardon
but
could
not
to
attempt
to
leave
the
room
i
had
not
the
hardihood
then
there
happened
something
the
recollection
of
which
causes
the
pen
to
tremble
in
my
hand
with
shame
a
button
of
mine
the
devil
take
it
a
button
of
mine
that
was
hanging
by
a
single
thread
suddenly
broke
off
and
hopped
and
skipped
and
rattled
and
rolled
until
it
had
reached
the
feet
of
his
excellency
himself
this
amid
a
profound
general
silence
that
was
what
came
of
my
intended
and
plea
for
mercy
that
was
the
only
answer
that
i
had
to
return
to
my
chief
the
sequel
i
shudder
to
relate
at
once
his
excellency
s
attention
became
drawn
to
my
figure
and
costume
i
remembered
what
i
had
seen
in
the
mirror
and
hastened
to
pursue
the
button
obstinacy
of
a
sort
seized
upon
me
and
i
did
my
best
to
arrest
the
thing
but
it
slipped
away
and
kept
turning
over
and
over
so
that
i
could
not
grasp
it
and
made
a
sad
spectacle
of
myself
with
my
awkwardness
then
there
came
over
me
a
feeling
that
my
last
remaining
strength
was
about
to
leave
me
and
that
all
all
was
lost
reputation
manhood
everything
in
both
ears
i
seemed
to
hear
the
voices
of
theresa
and
phaldoni
at
length
however
i
grasped
the
button
and
raising
and
straightening
myself
stood
humbly
with
clasped
hands
looking
a
veritable
fool
but
no
first
of
all
i
tried
to
attach
the
button
to
the
ragged
threads
and
smiled
each
time
that
it
broke
away
from
them
and
smiled
again
in
the
beginning
his
excellency
had
turned
away
but
now
he
threw
me
another
glance
and
i
heard
him
say
to
evstafi
ivanovitch
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
the
fellow
look
at
the
figure
he
cuts
who
to
god
is
he
ah
beloved
only
to
hear
that
who
to
god
is
he
truly
i
had
made
myself
a
marked
man
in
reply
to
his
excellency
evstafi
murmured
he
is
no
one
of
any
note
though
his
character
is
good
besides
his
salary
is
sufficient
as
the
scale
very
well
then
but
help
him
out
of
his
difficulties
somehow
said
his
excellency
give
him
a
trifle
of
salary
in
it
is
all
forestalled
was
the
reply
he
drew
it
some
time
ago
but
his
record
is
good
there
is
nothing
against
at
this
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
hell
fire
i
could
actually
have
died
well
well
said
his
excellency
let
him
copy
out
the
document
a
second
time
dievushkin
come
here
you
are
to
make
another
copy
of
this
paper
and
to
make
it
as
quickly
as
with
that
he
turned
to
some
other
officials
present
issued
to
them
a
few
orders
and
the
company
dispersed
no
sooner
had
they
done
so
than
his
excellency
hurriedly
pulled
out
a
took
thence
a
note
for
a
hundred
roubles
and
with
the
words
take
this
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
afford
treat
it
as
you
like
placed
the
money
in
my
hand
at
this
dearest
i
started
and
trembled
for
i
was
moved
to
my
very
soul
what
next
i
did
i
hardly
know
except
that
i
know
that
i
seized
his
excellency
by
the
hand
but
he
only
grew
very
red
and
then
no
i
am
not
departing
by
a
hair
from
the
truth
it
is
true
that
he
took
this
unworthy
hand
in
his
and
shook
it
yes
he
took
this
hand
of
mine
in
his
and
shook
it
as
though
i
had
been
his
equal
as
though
i
had
been
a
general
like
himself
go
now
he
said
this
is
all
that
i
can
do
for
you
make
no
further
mistakes
and
i
will
overlook
your
what
i
think
about
it
is
this
i
beg
of
you
and
of
thedora
and
had
i
any
children
i
should
beg
of
them
also
to
pray
ever
to
god
for
his
excellency
i
should
say
to
my
children
for
your
father
you
need
not
pray
but
for
his
excellency
i
bid
you
pray
until
your
lives
shall
yes
dear
one
i
tell
you
this
in
all
solemnity
so
hearken
well
unto
my
words
that
though
during
these
cruel
days
of
our
adversity
i
have
nearly
died
of
distress
of
soul
at
the
sight
of
you
and
your
poverty
as
well
as
at
the
sight
of
myself
and
my
abasement
and
helplessness
i
yet
care
less
for
the
hundred
roubles
which
his
excellency
has
given
me
than
for
the
fact
that
he
was
good
enough
to
take
the
hand
of
a
wretched
drunkard
in
his
own
and
press
it
by
that
act
he
restored
me
to
myself
by
that
act
he
revived
my
courage
he
made
life
forever
sweet
to
me
yes
sure
am
i
that
sinner
though
i
be
before
the
almighty
my
prayers
for
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
his
excellency
will
yet
ascend
to
the
heavenly
throne
but
my
darling
for
the
moment
i
am
terribly
agitated
and
distraught
my
heart
is
beating
as
though
it
would
burst
my
breast
and
all
my
body
seems
weak
i
send
you
roubles
in
notes
another
twenty
i
shall
give
to
my
landlady
and
the
remaining
i
shall
keep
twenty
for
new
clothes
and
fifteen
for
actual
living
expenses
but
these
experiences
of
the
morning
have
shaken
me
to
the
core
and
i
must
rest
awhile
it
is
quiet
very
quiet
here
my
breath
is
coming
in
jerks
deep
down
in
my
breast
i
can
hear
it
sobbing
and
trembling
i
will
come
and
see
you
soon
but
at
the
moment
my
head
is
aching
with
these
various
sensations
god
sees
all
things
my
darling
my
priceless
treasure
your
steadfast
friend
makar
dievushkin
september
my
beloved
makar
alexievitch
i
am
unspeakably
rejoiced
at
your
good
fortune
and
fully
appreciate
the
kindness
of
your
superior

take
a
rest
from
your
cares

not
again
spend
money
to
no
advantage
live
as
quietly
and
as
frugally
as
possible
and
from
today
begin
always
to
set
aside
something
lest
misfortune
again
overtake
you
do
not
for
god
s
sake
worry
yourself
thedora
and
i
will
get
on
somehow
why
have
you
sent
me
so
much
money
i
really
do
not
need
it
what
i
had
already
would
have
been
quite
sufficient
true
i
shall
soon
be
needing
further
funds
if
i
am
to
leave
these
lodgings
but
thedora
is
hoping
before
long
to
receive
repayment
of
an
old
debt
of
course
at
least
twenty
roubles
will
have
to
be
set
aside
for
indispensable
requirements
but
the
remainder
shall
be
returned
to
you
pray
take
care
of
it
makar
alexievitch

spirits

felt

terribly
weary

in

out
of
respect
for
his
excellency

every
action

letters
with

another

know
any
more
sorrows

live
twice
as
happily
and
comfortably
as

old

exchange
books
angel
of
my
heart
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
my
fortunes
a
change
very
much
for
the
better
my
landlady
has
become
more
accommodating
theresa
has
recovered
her
senses
even
phaldoni
springs
to
do
my
bidding
likewise
i
have
made
my
peace
with
rataziaev
he
came
to
see
me
of
his
own
accord
the
moment
that
he
heard
the
glad
tidings
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
is
a
good
fellow
that
there
is
no
truth
in
the
slanders
that
one
hears
of
him
for
one
thing
i
have
discovered
that
he
never
had
any
intention
of
putting
me
and
yourself
into
a
book
this
he
told
me
himself
and
then
read
to
me
his
latest
work
as
for
his
calling
me
lovelace
he
had
intended
no
rudeness
or
indecency
thereby
the
term
is
merely
one
of
foreign
derivation
meaning
a
clever
fellow
or
in
more
literary
and
elegant
language
a
gentleman
with
whom
one
must
reckon
that
is
all
it
was
a
mere
harmless
jest
my
beloved
only
ignorance
made
me
lose
my
temper
and
i
have
expressed
to
him
my
regret
how
beautiful
is
the
weather
today
my
little
barbara
true
there
was
a
slight
frost
in
the
early
morning
as
though
scattered
through
a
sieve
but
it
was
nothing
and
the
breeze
soon
freshened
the
air
i
went
out
to
buy
some
shoes
and
obtained
a
splendid
pair
then
after
a
stroll
along
the
nevski
prospect
i
read
the
daily
bee
this
reminds
me
that
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
you
the
most
important
thing
of
all
it
happened
like
this
this
morning
i
had
a
talk
with
emelia
ivanovitch
and
aksenti
michaelovitch
concerning
his
excellency
apparently
i
am
not
the
only
person
to
whom
he
has
acted
kindly
and
been
charitable
for
he
is
known
to
the
whole
world
for
his
goodness
of
heart
in
many
quarters
his
praises
are
to
be
heard
in
many
quarters
he
has
called
forth
tears
of
gratitude
among
other
things
he
undertook
the
care
of
an
orphaned
girl
and
married
her
to
an
official
the
son
of
a
poor
widow
and
found
this
man
place
in
a
certain
chancellory
and
in
other
ways
benefited
him
well
dearest
i
considered
it
to
be
my
duty
to
add
my
mite
by
publishing
abroad
the
story
of
his
excellency
s
gracious
treatment
of
myself
accordingly
i
related
the
whole
occurrence
to
my
interlocutors
and
concealed
not
a
single
detail
in
fact
i
put
my
pride
into
my
pocket
though
why
should
i
feel
ashamed
of
having
been
elated
by
such
an
occurrence
let
it
only
be
noised
afield
said
i
to
myself
and
it
will
resound
greatly
to
his
excellency
s
so
i
expressed
myself
enthusiastically
on
the
subject
and
never
faltered
on
the
contrary
i
felt
proud
to
have
such
a
story
to
tell
i
referred
to
every
one
concerned
except
to
yourself
of
course
dearest
to
my
landlady
to
phaldoni
to
rataziaev
to
markov
i
even
mentioned
the
matter
of
my
shoes
some
of
those
standing
by
laughed
in
fact
every
one
present
did
so
but
probably
it
was
my
own
figure
or
the
incident
of
my
shoes
more
particularly
the
latter
that
excited
merriment
for
i
am
sure
it
was
not
meant
my
hearers
may
have
been
young
men
or
well
off
certainly
they
can
not
have
been
laughing
with
evil
intent
at
what
i
had
said
anything
against
his
excellency
can
not
have
been
in
their
thoughts
eh
barbara
even
now
i
can
not
wholly
collect
my
faculties
so
upset
am
i
by
recent
events
have
you
any
fuel
to
go
on
with
barbara
you
must
not
expose
yourself
to
cold
also
you
have
depressed
my
spirits
with
your
fears
for
the
future
daily
i
pray
to
god
on
your
behalf
ah
how
i
pray
to
him
likewise
have
you
any
woollen
stockings
to
wear
and
warm
clothes
generally
mind
you
if
there
is
anything
you
need
you
must
not
hurt
an
old
man
s
feelings
by
failing
to
apply
to
him
for
what
you
require
the
bad
times
are
gone
now
and
the
future
is
looking
bright
and
fair
but
what
bad
times
they
were
barbara
even
though
they
be
gone
and
can
no
longer
matter
as
the
years
pass
on
we
shall
gradually
recover
ourselves
how
clearly
i
remember
my
youth
in
those
days
i
never
had
a
kopeck
to
spare
yet
cold
and
hungry
though
i
was
i
was
always
in
the
morning
i
would
walk
the
nevski
prospect
and
meet
people
and
be
happy
all
day
yes
it
was
a
glorious
a
glorious
time
it
was
good
to
be
alive
especially
in
petersburg
yet
it
is
but
yesterday
that
i
was
beseeching
god
with
tears
to
pardon
me
my
sins
during
the
late
sorrowful
period
to
pardon
me
my
murmurings
and
evil
thoughts
and
gambling
and
drunkenness
and
you
i
remembered
in
my
prayers
for
you
alone
have
encouraged
and
comforted
me
you
alone
have
given
me
advice
and
instruction
i
shall
never
forget
that
dearest
today
i
gave
each
one
of
your
letters
a
kiss
goodbye
beloved
i
have
been
told
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
sale
of
clothing
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
once
more
goodbye
goodbye
my
angel
yours
in
heart
and
soul
makar
dievushkin
september
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
i
am
in
terrible
distress
i
feel
sure
that
something
is
about
to
happen
the
matter
my
beloved
friend
is
that
monsieur
bwikov
is
again
in
petersburg
for
thedora
has
met
him
he
was
driving
along
in
a
drozhki
but
on
meeting
thedora
he
ordered
the
coachman
to
stop
sprang
out
and
inquired
of
her
where
she
was
living
but
this
she
would
not
tell
him
next
he
said
with
a
smile
that
he
knew
quite
well
who
was
living
with
her
evidently
anna
thedorovna
had
told
him
whereupon
thedora
could
hold
out
no
longer
but
then
and
there
in
the
street
railed
at
and
abused
him
telling
him
that
he
was
an
immoral
man
and
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortunes
to
this
he
replied
that
a
person
who
did
not
possess
a
groat
must
surely
be
rather
badly
off
to
which
thedora
retorted
that
i
could
always
either
live
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
or
marry
that
it
was
not
so
much
a
question
of
my
losing
posts
as
of
my
losing
my
happiness
the
ruin
of
which
had
led
almost
to
my
death
in
reply
he
observed
that
though
i
was
still
quite
young
i
seemed
to
have
lost
my
wits
and
that
my
virtue
appeared
to
be
under
a
cloud
i
quote
his
exact
words
both
i
and
thedora
had
thought
that
he
does
not
know
where
i
live
but
last
night
just
as
i
had
left
the
house
to
make
a
few
purchases
in
the
gostinni
dvor
he
appeared
at
our
rooms
evidently
he
had
not
wanted
to
find
me
at
home
and
put
many
questions
to
thedora
concerning
our
way
of
living
then
after
inspecting
my
work
he
wound
up
with
who
is
this
tchinovnik
friend
of
yours
at
the
moment
you
happened
to
be
passing
through
the
courtyard
so
thedora
pointed
you
out
and
the
man
peered
at
you
and
laughed
thedora
next
asked
him
to
depart
telling
him
that
i
was
still
ill
from
grief
and
that
it
would
give
me
great
pain
to
see
him
there
to
which
after
a
pause
he
replied
that
he
had
come
because
he
had
had
nothing
better
to
do
also
he
was
for
giving
thedora
roubles
but
of
course
she
declined
them
what
does
it
all
mean
why
has
he
paid
this
visit
i
can
not
understand
his
getting
to
know
about
me
i
am
lost
in
conjecture
thedora
however
says
that
aksinia
her
who
sometimes
comes
to
see
her
is
acquainted
with
a
laundress
named
nastasia
and
that
this
woman
has
a
cousin
in
the
position
of
watchman
to
a
department
of
which
a
certain
friend
of
anna
thedorovna
s
nephew
forms
one
of
the
staff
can
it
be
therefore
that
an
intrigue
has
been
hatched
through
this
channel
but
thedora
may
be
entirely
mistaken
we
hardly
know
what
to
think
what
if
he
should
come
again
the
very
thought
terrifies
me
when
thedora
told
me
of
this
last
night
such
terror
seized
upon
me
that
i
almost
swooned
away
what
can
the
man
be
wanting
at
all
events
i
refuse
to
know
such
people
what
have
they
to
do
with
my
wretched
self
ah
how
i
am
haunted
with
anxiety
for
every
moment
i
keep
thinking
that
bwikov
is
at
hand
what
will
become
of
me
what
more
has
fate
in
store
for
me
for
christ
s
sake
come
and
see
me
makar
alexievitch
for
christ
s
sake
come
and
see
me
soon
september
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
today
there
took
place
in
this
house
a
most
lamentable
a
most
mysterious
a
most
occurrence
first
of
all
let
me
tell
you
that
poor
gorshkov
has
been
entirely
absolved
of
guilt
the
decision
has
been
long
in
coming
but
this
morning
he
went
to
hear
the
final
resolution
read
it
was
entirely
in
his
favour
any
culpability
which
had
been
imputed
to
him
for
negligence
and
irregularity
was
removed
by
the
resolution
likewise
he
was
authorised
to
recover
of
the
merchant
a
large
sum
of
money
thus
he
stands
entirely
justified
and
has
had
his
character
cleansed
from
all
stain
in
short
he
could
not
have
wished
for
a
more
complete
vindication
when
he
arrived
home
at
three
o
clock
he
was
looking
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
his
lips
were
quivering
yet
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
as
he
embraced
his
wife
and
children
in
a
body
the
rest
of
us
ran
to
congratulate
him
and
he
was
greatly
moved
by
the
act
bowing
to
us
he
pressed
our
hands
in
turn
as
he
did
so
i
thought
somehow
that
he
seemed
to
have
grown
taller
and
straighter
and
that
the
seemed
to
have
disappeared
from
his
eyelashes
yet
how
agitated
he
was
poor
fellow
he
could
not
rest
quietly
for
two
minutes
together
but
kept
picking
up
and
then
dropping
whatsoever
came
to
his
hand
and
bowing
and
smiling
without
intermission
and
sitting
down
and
getting
up
and
again
sitting
down
and
chattering
god
only
knows
what
about
his
honour
and
his
good
name
and
his
little
ones
how
he
did
talk
yes
and
weep
too
indeed
few
of
ourselves
could
refrain
from
tears
although
rataziaev
remarked
probably
to
encourage
gorshkov
that
honour
mattered
nothing
when
one
had
nothing
to
eat
and
that
money
was
the
chief
thing
in
the
world
and
that
for
it
alone
ought
god
to
be
thanked
then
he
slapped
gorshkov
on
the
shoulder
but
i
thought
that
gorshkov
somehow
seemed
hurt
at
this
he
did
not
express
any
open
displeasure
but
threw
rataziaev
a
curious
look
and
removed
his
hand
from
his
shoulder
once
upon
a
time
he
would
not
have
acted
thus
but
characters
differ
for
example
i
myself
should
have
hesitated
at
such
a
season
of
rejoicing
to
seem
proud
even
though
excessive
deference
and
civility
at
such
a
moment
might
have
been
construed
as
a
lapse
both
of
moral
courage
and
of
mental
vigour
however
this
is
none
of
my
business
all
that
gorshkov
said
was
yes
money
is
a
good
thing
glory
be
to
god
in
fact
the
whole
time
that
we
remained
in
his
room
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
glory
be
to
god
glory
be
to
god
his
wife
ordered
a
richer
and
more
delicate
meal
than
usual
and
the
landlady
herself
cooked
it
for
at
heart
she
is
not
a
bad
woman
but
until
the
meal
was
served
gorshkov
could
not
remain
still
he
kept
entering
everyone
s
room
in
turn
whether
invited
thither
or
not
and
seating
himself
smilingly
upon
a
chair
would
sometimes
say
something
and
sometimes
not
utter
a
word
but
get
up
and
go
out
again
in
the
naval
officer
s
room
he
even
took
a
pack
of
into
his
hand
and
was
thereupon
invited
to
make
a
fourth
in
a
game
but
after
losing
a
few
times
as
well
as
making
several
blunders
in
his
play
he
abandoned
the
pursuit
no
said
he
that
is
the
sort
of
man
that
i
am
that
is
all
that
i
am
good
for
and
departed
next
encountering
myself
in
the
corridor
he
took
my
hands
in
his
and
gazed
into
my
face
with
a
rather
curious
air
then
he
pressed
my
hands
again
and
moved
away
still
smiling
smiling
but
in
an
odd
weary
sort
of
manner
much
as
a
corpse
might
smile
meanwhile
his
wife
was
weeping
for
joy
and
everything
in
their
room
was
decked
in
holiday
guise
presently
dinner
was
served
and
after
they
had
dined
gorshkov
said
to
his
wife
see
now
dearest
i
am
going
to
rest
a
little
while
and
with
that
went
to
bed
presently
he
called
his
little
daughter
to
his
side
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
child
s
head
lay
a
long
while
looking
at
her
then
he
turned
to
his
wife
again
and
asked
her
what
of
petinka
where
is
our
petinka
whereupon
his
wife
crossed
herself
and
replied
why
our
petinka
is
dead
yes
yes
i
know
of
course
said
her
husband
petinka
is
now
in
the
kingdom
of
this
showed
his
wife
that
her
husband
was
not
quite
in
his
right
senses
that
the
recent
occurrence
had
upset
him
so
she
said
my
dearest
you
must
sleep
i
will
do
so
he
replied
at
once
i
am
rather
and
he
turned
over
and
lay
silent
for
a
time
then
again
he
turned
round
and
tried
to
say
something
but
his
wife
could
not
hear
what
it
was
what
do
you
say
she
inquired
but
he
made
no
reply
then
again
she
waited
a
few
moments
until
she
thought
to
herself
he
has
gone
to
sleep
and
departed
to
spend
an
hour
with
the
landlady
at
the
end
of
that
hour
she
returned
only
to
find
that
her
husband
had
not
yet
awoken
but
was
still
lying
motionless
he
is
sleeping
very
soundly
she
reflected
as
she
sat
down
and
began
to
work
at
something
or
other
since
then
she
has
told
us
that
when
half
an
hour
or
so
had
elapsed
she
fell
into
a
reverie
what
she
was
thinking
of
she
can
not
remember
save
that
she
had
forgotten
altogether
about
her
husband
then
she
awoke
with
a
curious
sort
of
sensation
at
her
heart
the
first
thing
that
struck
her
was
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
room
glancing
at
the
bed
she
perceived
her
husband
to
be
lying
in
the
same
position
as
before
thereupon
she
approached
him
turned
the
coverlet
back
and
saw
that
he
was
stiff
and
cold
that
he
had
died
suddenly
as
though
smitten
with
a
stroke
but
of
what
precisely
he
died
god
only
knows
the
affair
has
so
terribly
impressed
me
that
even
now
i
can
not
fully
collect
my
thoughts
it
would
scarcely
be
believed
that
a
human
being
could
die
so
simply
and
he
such
a
poor
needy
wretch
this
gorshkov
what
a
fate
what
a
fate
to
be
sure
his
wife
is
plunged
in
tears
and
while
his
little
daughter
has
run
away
somewhere
to
hide
herself
in
their
room
however
all
is
bustle
and
confusion
for
the
doctors
are
about
to
make
an
autopsy
on
the
corpse
but
i
can
not
tell
you
things
for
certain
i
only
know
that
i
am
most
grieved
most
grieved
how
sad
to
think
that
one
never
knows
what
even
a
day
what
even
an
hour
may
bring
forth
one
seems
to
die
to
so
little
purpose
your
own
makar
dievushkin
september
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
i
hasten
to
let
you
know
that
rataziaev
has
found
me
some
work
to
do
for
a
certain
writer
the
latter
having
submitted
to
him
a
large
manuscript
glory
be
to
god
for
this
means
a
large
amount
of
work
to
do
yet
though
the
copy
is
wanted
in
haste
the
original
is
so
carelessly
written
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
set
about
my
task
indeed
certain
parts
of
the
manuscript
are
almost
undecipherable
i
have
agreed
to
do
the
work
for
forty
kopecks
a
sheet
you
see
therefore
and
this
is
my
true
reason
for
writing
to
you
that
we
shall
soon
be
receiving
money
from
an
extraneous
source
goodbye
now
as
i
must
begin
upon
my
your
sincere
friend
makar
dievushkin
september
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
i
have
not
written
to
you
these
three
days
past
for
the
reason
that
i
have
been
so
worried
and
alarmed
three
days
ago
bwikov
came
again
to
see
me
at
the
time
i
was
alone
for
thedora
had
gone
out
somewhere
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
door
the
sight
of
him
so
terrified
me
that
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
and
could
feel
myself
turning
pale
entering
with
his
usual
loud
laugh
he
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
for
a
long
while
i
could
not
collect
my
thoughts
i
just
sat
where
i
was
and
went
on
with
my
work
soon
his
smile
faded
for
my
appearance
seemed
somehow
to
have
struck
him
you
see
of
late
i
have
grown
thin
and
my
eyes
and
cheeks
have
fallen
in
and
my
face
has
become
as
white
as
a
sheet
so
that
anyone
who
knew
me
a
year
ago
would
scarcely
recognise
me
now
after
a
prolonged
inspection
bwikov
seemed
to
recover
his
spirits
for
he
said
something
to
which
i
duly
replied
then
again
he
laughed
thus
he
sat
for
a
whole
hour
talking
to
me
the
while
and
asking
me
questions
about
one
thing
and
another
at
length
just
before
he
rose
to
depart
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
to
quote
his
exact
words
between
ourselves
barbara
alexievna
that
kinswoman
of
yours
and
my
good
friend
and
acquaintance
i
refer
to
anna
thedorovna
is
a
very
bad
woman
he
also
added
a
grosser
term
of
opprobrium
first
of
all
she
led
your
cousin
astray
and
then
she
ruined
yourself
i
also
have
behaved
like
a
villain
but
such
is
the
way
of
the
again
he
laughed
next
having
remarked
that
though
not
a
master
of
eloquence
he
had
always
considered
that
obligations
of
gentility
obliged
him
to
have
with
me
a
clear
and
outspoken
explanation
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
sought
my
hand
in
marriage
that
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
duty
to
restore
to
me
my
honour
that
he
could
offer
me
riches
that
after
marriage
he
would
take
me
to
his
country
seat
in
the
steppes
where
we
would
hunt
hares
that
he
intended
never
to
visit
petersburg
again
since
everything
there
was
horrible
and
he
had
to
entertain
a
worthless
nephew
whom
he
had
sworn
to
disinherit
in
favour
of
a
legal
heir
and
finally
that
it
was
to
obtain
such
a
legal
heir
that
he
was
seeking
my
hand
in
marriage
lastly
he
remarked
that
i
seemed
to
be
living
in
very
poor
circumstances
which
was
not
surprising
said
he
in
view
of
the
kennel
that
i
inhabited
that
i
should
die
if
i
remained
a
month
longer
in
that
den
that
all
lodgings
in
petersburg
were
detestable
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
know
if
i
was
in
want
of
anything
so
thunderstruck
was
i
with
the
proposal
that
i
could
only
burst
into
tears
these
tears
he
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
gratitude
for
he
told
me
that
he
had
always
felt
assured
of
my
good
sense
cleverness
and
sensibility
but
that
hitherto
he
had
hesitated
to
take
this
step
until
he
should
have
learned
precisely
how
i
was
getting
on
next
he
asked
me
some
questions
about
you
saying
that
he
had
heard
of
you
as
a
man
of
good
principle
and
that
since
he
was
unwilling
to
remain
your
debtor
would
a
sum
of
five
hundred
roubles
repay
you
for
all
you
had
done
for
me
to
this
i
replied
that
your
services
to
myself
had
been
such
as
could
never
be
requited
with
money
whereupon
he
exclaimed
that
i
was
talking
rubbish
and
nonsense
that
evidently
i
was
still
young
enough
to
read
poetry
that
romances
of
this
kind
were
the
undoing
of
young
girls
that
books
only
corrupted
morality
and
that
for
his
part
he
could
not
abide
them
you
ought
to
live
as
long
as
i
have
done
he
added
and
then
you
will
see
what
men
can
with
that
he
requested
me
to
give
his
proposal
my
favourable
consideration
saying
that
he
would
not
like
me
to
take
such
an
important
step
unguardedly
since
want
of
thought
and
impetuosity
often
spelt
ruin
to
youthful
inexperience
but
that
he
hoped
to
receive
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
otherwise
said
he
i
shall
have
no
choice
but
to
marry
a
certain
merchant
s
daughter
in
moscow
in
order
that
i
may
keep
my
vow
to
deprive
my
nephew
of
the
then
he
pressed
five
hundred
roubles
into
my
hand
to
buy
myself
some
bonbons
as
he
phrased
it
and
wound
up
by
saying
that
in
the
country
i
should
grow
as
fat
as
a
doughnut
or
a
cheese
rolled
in
butter
that
at
the
present
moment
he
was
extremely
busy
and
that
deeply
engaged
in
business
though
he
had
been
all
day
he
had
snatched
the
present
opportunity
of
paying
me
a
visit
at
length
he
departed
for
a
long
time
i
sat
plunged
in
reflection
great
though
my
distress
of
mind
was
i
soon
arrived
at
a
decision
my
friend
i
am
going
to
marry
this
man
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
his
proposal
if
anyone
could
save
me
from
this
squalor
and
restore
to
me
my
good
name
and
avert
from
me
future
poverty
and
want
and
misfortune
he
is
the
man
to
do
it
what
else
have
i
to
look
for
from
the
future
what
more
am
i
to
ask
of
fate
thedora
declares
that
one
need
never
lose
one
s
happiness
but
what
i
ask
her
can
be
called
happiness
under
such
circumstances
as
mine
at
all
events
i
see
no
other
road
open
dear
friend
i
see
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
have
worked
until
i
have
ruined
my
health
i
can
not
go
on
working
forever
shall
i
go
out
into
the
world
nay
i
am
worn
to
a
shadow
with
grief
and
become
good
for
nothing
sickly
by
nature
i
should
merely
be
a
burden
upon
other
folks
of
course
this
marriage
will
not
bring
me
paradise
but
what
else
does
there
remain
my
friend
what
else
does
there
remain
what
other
choice
is
left
i
had
not
asked
your
advice
earlier
for
the
reason
that
i
wanted
to
think
the
matter
over
alone
however
the
decision
which
you
have
just
read
is
unalterable
and
i
am
about
to
announce
it
to
bwikov
himself
who
in
any
case
has
pressed
me
for
a
speedy
reply
owing
to
the
fact
so
he
says
that
his
business
will
not
wait
nor
allow
him
to
remain
here
longer
and
that
therefore
no
trifle
must
be
allowed
to
stand
in
its
way
god
alone
knows
whether
i
shall
be
happy
but
my
fate
is
in
his
holy
his
inscrutable
hand
and
i
have
so
decided
bwikov
is
said
to
be
he
will
at
least
respect
me
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
return
that
respect
what
more
could
be
looked
for
from
such
a
marriage
i
have
now
told
you
all
makar
alexievitch
and
feel
sure
that
you
will
understand
my
despondency
do
not
however
try
to
divert
me
from
my
intention
for
all
your
efforts
will
be
in
vain
think
for
a
moment
weigh
in
your
heart
for
a
moment
all
that
has
led
me
to
take
this
step
at
first
my
anguish
was
extreme
but
now
i
am
quieter
what
awaits
me
i
know
not
what
must
be
must
be
and
as
god
may
send
bwikov
has
just
arrived
so
i
am
leaving
this
letter
unfinished
otherwise
i
had
much
else
to
say
to
you
bwikov
is
even
now
at
the
door
september
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
i
hasten
to
reply
to
you
i
hasten
to
express
to
you
my
extreme
astonishment
in
passing
i
may
mention
that
yesterday
we
buried
poor
gorshkov
yes
bwikov
has
acted
nobly
and
you
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
him
all
things
are
in
god
s
hands
this
is
so
and
must
always
be
so
and
the
purposes
of
the
divine
creator
are
at
once
good
and
inscrutable
as
also
is
fate
which
is
one
with
him
thedora
will
share
your
happiness
for
of
course
you
will
be
happy
and
free
from
want
darling
dearest
sweetest
of
angels
but
why
should
the
matter
be
so
hurried
oh
of
course
monsieur
bwikov
s
business
affairs
only
a
man
who
has
no
affairs
to
see
to
can
afford
to
disregard
such
things
i
got
a
glimpse
of
monsieur
bwikov
as
he
was
leaving
your
door
he
is
a
man
a
very
man
though
that
is
not
the
point
that
i
should
most
have
noticed
had
i
been
quite
myself
at
the
time
in
the
future
shall
we
be
able
to
write
letters
to
one
another
i
keep
wondering
and
wondering
what
has
led
you
to
say
all
that
you
have
said
to
think
that
just
when
twenty
pages
of
my
copying
are
completed
this
has
happened
i
suppose
you
will
be
able
to
make
many
purchases
now
to
buy
shoes
and
dresses
and
all
sorts
of
things
do
you
remember
the
shops
in
gorokhovaia
street
of
which
i
used
to
speak
but
no
you
ought
not
to
go
out
at
present
you
simply
ought
not
to
and
shall
not
presently
you
will
he
able
to
buy
many
many
things
and
to
keep
a
carriage
also
at
present
the
weather
is
bad
rain
is
descending
in
pailfuls
and
it
is
such
a
soaking
kind
of
rain
that
that
you
might
catch
cold
from
it
my
darling
and
the
chill
might
go
to
your
heart
why
should
your
fear
of
this
man
lead
you
to
take
such
risks
when
all
the
time
i
am
here
to
do
your
bidding
so
thedora
declares
great
happiness
to
be
awaiting
you
does
she
she
is
a
gossiping
old
woman
and
evidently
desires
to
ruin
you
shall
you
be
at
the
mass
this
evening
dearest
i
should
like
to
come
and
see
you
there
yes
bwikov
spoke
but
the
truth
when
he
said
that
you
are
a
woman
of
virtue
wit
and
good
feeling
yet
i
think
he
would
do
far
better
to
marry
the
merchant
s
daughter
what
think
you
about
it
yes
twould
be
far
better
for
him
as
soon
as
it
grows
dark
tonight
i
mean
to
come
and
sit
with
you
for
an
hour
tonight
twilight
will
close
in
early
so
i
shall
soon
be
with
you
yes
come
what
may
i
mean
to
see
you
for
an
hour
at
present
i
suppose
you
are
expecting
bwikov
but
i
will
come
as
soon
as
he
has
gone
so
stay
at
home
until
i
have
arrived
dearest
makar
dievushkin
september
dear
makar
alexievitch
bwikov
has
just
informed
me
that
i
must
have
at
least
three
dozen
linen
blouses
so
i
must
go
at
once
and
look
for
sempstresses
to
make
two
out
of
the
three
dozen
since
time
presses
indeed
monsieur
bwikov
is
quite
angry
about
the
fuss
which
these
fripperies
are
entailing
seeing
that
there
remain
but
five
days
before
the
wedding
and
we
are
to
depart
on
the
following
day
he
keeps
rushing
about
and
declaring
that
no
time
ought
to
be
wasted
on
trifles
i
am
terribly
worried
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
on
my
feet
there
is
so
much
to
do
and
perhaps
so
much
that
were
better
left
undone
moreover
i
have
no
blond
or
other
lace
so
there
is
another
item
to
be
purchased
since
bwikov
declares
that
he
can
not
have
his
bride
look
like
a
cook
but
on
the
contrary
she
must
put
the
noses
of
the
great
ladies
out
of
that
is
his
expression
i
wish
therefore
that
you
would
go
to
madame
chiffon
s
in
gorokhovaia
street
and
ask
her
in
the
first
place
to
send
me
some
sempstresses
and
in
the
second
place
to
give
herself
the
trouble
of
coming
in
person
as
i
am
too
ill
to
go
out
our
new
flat
is
very
cold
and
still
in
great
disorder
also
bwikov
has
an
aunt
who
is
at
her
last
gasp
through
old
age
and
may
die
before
our
departure
he
himself
however
declares
this
to
be
nothing
and
says
that
she
will
soon
recover
he
is
not
yet
living
with
me
and
i
have
to
go
running
hither
and
thither
to
find
him
only
thedora
is
acting
as
my
servant
together
with
bwikov
s
valet
who
oversees
everything
but
has
been
absent
for
the
past
three
days
each
morning
bwikov
goes
to
business
and
loses
his
temper
yesterday
he
even
had
some
trouble
with
the
police
because
of
his
thrashing
the
steward
of
these
buildings
i
have
no
one
to
send
with
this
letter
so
i
am
going
to
post
it
ah
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
most
important
point
which
is
that
i
should
like
you
to
go
and
tell
madame
chiffon
that
i
wish
the
blond
lace
to
be
changed
in
conformity
with
yesterday
s
patterns
if
she
will
be
good
enough
to
bring
with
her
a
new
assortment
also
say
that
i
have
altered
my
mind
about
the
satin
which
i
wish
to
be
tamboured
with
also
that
tambour
is
to
be
used
with
monograms
on
the
various
garments
do
you
hear
tambour
not
smooth
work
do
not
forget
that
it
is
to
be
tambour
another
thing
i
had
almost
forgotten
which
is
that
the
lappets
of
the
fur
cloak
must
be
raised
and
the
collar
bound
with
lace
please
tell
her
these
things
makar
your
friend
d
i
am
so
ashamed
to
trouble
you
with
my
commissions
this
is
the
third
morning
that
you
will
have
spent
in
running
about
for
my
sake
but
what
else
am
i
to
do
the
whole
place
is
in
disorder
and
i
myself
am
do
not
be
vexed
with
me
makar
alexievitch
i
am
feeling
so
depressed
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
dear
friend
dear
kind
old
makar
alexievitch
i
dread
to
look
forward
into
the
future
somehow
i
feel
apprehensive
i
am
living
as
it
were
in
a
mist
yet
for
god
s
sake
forget
none
of
my
commissions
i
am
so
afraid
lest
you
should
make
a
mistake
remember
that
everything
is
to
be
tambour
work
not
smooth
september
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
i
have
carefully
fulfilled
your
commissions
madame
chiffon
informs
me
that
she
herself
had
thought
of
using
tambour
work
as
being
more
suitable
though
i
did
not
quite
take
in
all
she
said
also
she
has
informed
me
that
since
you
have
given
certain
directions
in
writing
she
has
followed
them
though
again
i
do
not
clearly
remember
all
that
she
said
i
only
remember
that
she
said
a
very
great
deal
for
she
is
a
most
tiresome
old
woman
these
observations
she
will
soon
be
repeating
to
you
in
person
for
myself
i
feel
absolutely
exhausted
and
have
not
been
to
the
office
today
do
not
despair
about
the
future
dearest
to
save
you
trouble
i
would
visit
every
shop
in
petersburg
you
write
that
you
dare
not
look
forward
into
the
future
but
by
tonight
at
seven
o
clock
you
will
have
learned
all
for
madame
chiffon
will
have
arrived
in
person
to
see
you
hope
on
and
everything
will
order
itself
for
the
best
of
course
i
am
referring
only
to
these
accursed
gewgaws
to
these
frills
and
fripperies
ah
me
ah
me
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see
you
my
angel
yes
how
glad
i
shall
be
twice
already
today
i
have
passed
the
gates
of
your
abode
unfortunately
this
bwikov
is
a
man
of
such
choler
that
well
things
are
as
they
are
makar
dievushkin
september
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
for
god
s
sake
go
to
the
jeweller
s
and
tell
him
that
after
all
he
need
not
make
the
pearl
and
emerald
earrings
monsieur
bwikov
says
that
they
will
cost
him
too
much
that
they
will
burn
a
veritable
hole
in
his
pocket
in
fact
he
has
lost
his
temper
again
and
declares
that
he
is
being
robbed
yesterday
he
added
that
had
he
but
known
but
foreseen
these
expenses
he
would
never
have
married
also
he
says
that
as
things
are
he
intends
only
to
have
a
plain
wedding
and
then
to
depart
you
must
not
look
for
any
dancing
or
festivity
or
entertainment
of
guests
for
our
gala
times
are
still
in
the
such
were
his
words
god
knows
i
do
not
want
such
things
but
none
the
less
bwikov
has
forbidden
them
i
made
him
no
answer
on
the
subject
for
he
is
a
man
all
too
easily
irritated
what
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
september
my
beloved
barbara
alexievna
all
is
well
as
regards
the
jeweller
unfortunately
i
have
also
to
say
that
i
myself
have
fallen
ill
and
can
not
rise
from
bed
just
when
so
many
things
need
to
be
done
i
have
gone
and
caught
a
chill
the
devil
take
it
also
i
have
to
tell
you
that
to
complete
my
misfortunes
his
excellency
has
been
pleased
to
become
stricter
today
he
railed
at
and
scolded
emelia
ivanovitch
until
the
poor
fellow
was
quite
put
about
that
is
the
sum
of
my
news
no
there
is
something
else
concerning
which
i
should
like
to
write
to
you
but
am
afraid
to
obtrude
upon
your
notice
i
am
a
simple
dull
fellow
who
writes
down
whatsoever
first
comes
into
his
head
your
friend
makar
dievushkin
september
my
own
barbara
alexievna
today
dearest
i
saw
thedora
who
informed
me
that
you
are
to
be
married
tomorrow
and
on
the
following
day
to
go
away
for
which
purpose
bwikov
has
ordered
a
well
of
the
incident
of
his
excellency
i
have
already
told
you
also
i
have
verified
the
bill
from
the
shop
in
gorokhovaia
street
it
is
correct
but
very
long
why
is
monsieur
bwikov
so
out
of
humour
with
you
nay
but
you
must
be
of
good
cheer
my
darling
i
am
so
and
shall
always
be
so
so
long
as
you
are
happy
i
should
have
come
to
the
church
tomorrow
but
alas
shall
be
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
pain
in
my
loins
also
i
would
have
written
an
account
of
the
ceremony
but
that
there
will
be
no
one
to
report
to
me
the
details
yes
you
have
been
a
very
good
friend
to
thedora
dearest
you
have
acted
kindly
very
kindly
towards
her
for
every
such
deed
god
will
bless
you
good
deeds
never
go
unrewarded
nor
does
virtue
ever
fail
to
win
the
crown
of
divine
justice
be
it
early
or
be
it
late
much
else
should
i
have
liked
to
write
to
you
every
hour
every
minute
i
could
occupy
in
writing
indeed
i
could
write
to
you
forever
only
your
book
the
stories
of
bielkin
is
left
to
me
do
not
deprive
me
of
it
i
pray
you
but
suffer
me
to
keep
it
it
is
not
so
much
because
i
wish
to
read
the
book
for
its
own
sake
as
because
winter
is
coming
on
when
the
evenings
will
be
long
and
dreary
and
one
will
want
to
read
at
least
something
do
you
know
i
am
going
to
move
from
my
present
quarters
into
your
old
ones
which
i
intend
to
rent
from
thedora
for
i
could
never
part
with
that
good
old
woman
moreover
she
is
such
a
splendid
worker
yesterday
i
inspected
your
empty
room
in
detail
and
inspected
your
with
the
work
still
hanging
on
it
it
had
been
left
untouched
in
its
corner
next
i
inspected
the
work
itself
of
which
there
still
remained
a
few
remnants
and
saw
that
you
had
used
one
of
my
letters
for
a
spool
upon
which
to
wind
your
thread
also
on
the
table
i
found
a
scrap
of
paper
which
had
written
on
it
my
dearest
makar
alexievitch
i
hasten
to
that
was
all
evidently
someone
had
interrupted
you
at
an
interesting
point
lastly
behind
a
screen
there
was
your
little
bed
oh
darling
of
darlings
well
goodbye
now
goodbye
now
but
for
god
s
sake

me
something
in
answer
to
this
letter

beloved
makar
alexievitch

in
my
prayers
thus
our
time
together

come
to
an
end
little
comfort
in
my
new
life

i
derive
from

of
the
past

throughout

how
well
you
love

single
smile
of
mine
a
single
stroke
from
my
pen
has
been
able
to
make
you
happy
but
now
you
must
forget
me
how
lonely
you
will
be

should
you
stay
here

inestimable
but
solitary
friend
of
mine

your
care

entrust
the
book
the
embroidery

letter

which
i
had
begun
when
you
look
upon
the
few
words
which
the
letter
contains
you
will
be
able
mentally
to
read
in
thought
all
that
you
would
have
liked
further
to
hear
or
receive
from
me
all
that
i
would
so
gladly
have
written

never
now
write

sometimes
of
your
poor
little
barbara
who
loved
you
so
well
all
your
letters
i
have
left
behind
me
in
the
top
drawer
of
thedora
s
chest
of
drawers
you
write
that
you
are
ill
but
monsieur
bwikov

not
let
me
leave
the
house
today
so
that
i
can
only
write
to
you
also
i
will
write
again
before
long
that
is
a
promise
yet
god
only
knows
when
i
shall
be
able
to
do
so
now
we
must
bid
one
another
forever
farewell

friend

this
moment

to
the
end
i
shall
keep
you
in
my
prayers

my
heart
is
aching
under
its
load
of
sorrow
monsieur
bwikov
is
just
calling
for
me
your
ever
loving
b
my
heart
is
full
it
is
full
to
bursting
of
tears
sorrow
has
me
in
its
grip
and
is
tearing
me
to
pieces
goodbye
my
god
what
grief
do
not

not
forget
your
poor
barbara
beloved
barbara
my
jewel
my
priceless
one
you
are
now
almost
en
route
you
are
now
just
about
to
depart
would
that
they
had
torn
my
heart
out
of
my
breast
rather
than
have
taken
you
away
from
me
how
could
you
allow
it
you
weep
yet
you
go
and
only
this
moment
i
have
received
from
you
a
letter
stained
with
your
tears
it
must
be
that
you
are
departing
unwillingly
it
must
be
that
you
are
being
abducted
against
your
will
it
must
be
that
you
are
sorry
for
me
it
must
be
that
that
you
love
me
yet
how
will
it
fare
with
you
now
your
heart
will
soon
have
become
chilled
and
sick
and
depressed
grief
will
soon
have
sucked
away
its
life
grief
will
soon
have
rent
it
in
twain
yes
you
will
die
where
you
be
and
be
laid
to
rest
in
the
cold
moist
earth
where
there
is
no
one
to
bewail
you
monsieur
bwikov
will
only
be
hunting
hares
ah
my
darling
my
darling
why
did
you
come
to
this
decision
how
could
you
bring
yourself
to
take
such
a
step
what
have
you
done
have
you
done
have
you
done
soon
they
will
be
carrying
you
away
to
the
tomb
soon
your
beauty
will
have
become
defiled
my
angel
ah
dearest
one
you
are
as
weak
as
a
feather
and
where
have
i
been
all
this
time
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
i
have
treated
you
merely
as
a
forward
child
whose
head
was
aching
fool
that
i
was
i
neither
saw
nor
understood
i
have
behaved
as
though
right
or
wrong
the
matter
was
in
no
way
my
concern
yes
i
have
been
running
about
after
fripperies
ah
but
i
will
leave
my
bed
tomorrow
i
will
rise
sound
and
well
and
be
once
more
myself
dearest
i
could
throw
myself
under
the
wheels
of
a
passing
vehicle
rather
than
that
you
should
go
like
this
by
what
right
is
it
being
done
i
will
go
with
you
i
will
run
behind
your
carriage
if
you
will
not
take
me
yes
i
will
run
and
run
so
long
as
the
power
is
in
me
and
until
my
breath
shall
have
failed
do
you
know
whither
you
are
going
perhaps
you
will
not
know
and
will
have
to
ask
me
before
you
there
lie
the
steppes
my
darling
only
the
steppes
the
naked
steppes
the
steppes
that
are
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
there
there
live
only
heartless
old
women
and
rude
peasants
and
drunkards
there
the
trees
have
already
shed
their
leaves
there
there
abide
but
rain
and
cold
why
should
you
go
thither
true
monsieur
bwikov
will
have
his
diversions
in
that
country
he
will
be
able
to
hunt
the
hare
but
what
of
yourself
do
you
wish
to
become
a
mere
estate
lady
nay
look
at
yourself
my
seraph
of
heaven
are
you
in
any
way
fitted
for
such
a
role
how
could
you
play
it
to
whom
should
i
write
letters
to
whom
should
i
send
these
missives
whom
should
i
call
my
darling
to
whom
should
i
apply
that
name
of
endearment
where
too
could
i
find
you
when
you
are
gone
barbara
i
shall
die
for
certain
i
shall
die
for
my
heart
can
not
bear
this
misery
i
love
you
as
i
love
the
light
of
god
i
love
you
as
my
own
daughter
to
you
i
have
devoted
my
love
in
its
entirety
only
for
you
have
i
lived
at
all
only
because
you
were
near
me
have
i
worked
and
copied
manuscripts
and
committed
my
views
to
paper
under
the
guise
of
friendly
letters
perhaps
you
did
not
know
all
this
but
it
has
been
so
how
then
my
beloved
could
you
bring
yourself
to
leave
me
nay
you
must
not
go
it
is
impossible
it
is
sheerly
it
is
utterly
impossible
the
rain
will
fall
upon
you
and
you
are
weak
and
will
catch
cold
the
floods
will
stop
your
carriage
no
sooner
will
it
have
passed
the
city
barriers
than
it
will
break
down
purposely
break
down
here
in
petersburg
they
are
bad
builders
of
carriages
yes
i
know
well
these
they
are
who
can
fashion
a
toy
but
nothing
that
is
durable
yes
i
swear
they
can
make
nothing
that
is
durable
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
go
upon
my
knees
before
monsieur
bwikov
and
to
tell
him
all
to
tell
him
all
do
you
also
tell
him
all
dearest
and
reason
with
him
tell
him
that
you
must
remain
here
and
must
not
go
ah
why
did
he
not
marry
that
merchant
s
daughter
in
moscow
let
him
go
and
marry
her
now
she
would
suit
him
far
better
and
for
reasons
which
i
well
know
then
i
could
keep
you
for
what
is
he
to
you
this
monsieur
bwikov
why
has
he
suddenly
become
so
dear
to
your
heart
is
it
because
he
can
buy
you
gewgaws
what
are
they
what
use
are
they
they
are
so
much
rubbish
one
should
consider
human
life
rather
than
mere
finery
nevertheless
as
soon
as
i
have
received
my
next
instalment
of
salary
i
mean
to
buy
you
a
new
cloak
i
mean
to
buy
it
at
a
shop
with
which
i
am
acquainted
only
you
must
wait
until
my
next
installment
is
due
my
angel
of
a
barbara
ah
god
my
god
to
think
that
you
are
going
away
into
the
steppes
with
monsieur
bwikov
that
you
are
going
away
never
to
return
nay
nay
but
you
shall
write
to
me
you
shall
write
me
a
letter
as
soon
as
you
have
started
even
if
it
be
your
last
letter
of
all
my
dearest
yet
will
it
be
your
last
letter
how
has
it
come
about
so
suddenly
so
irrevocably
that
this
letter
should
be
your
last
nay
nay
i
will
write
and
you
shall
write
yes
now
when
at
length
i
am
beginning
to
improve
my
style
style
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
writing
i
never
do
know
what
i
am
writing
i
could
not
possibly
know
for
i
never
read
over
what
i
have
written
nor
correct
its
orthography
at
the
present
moment
i
am
writing
merely
for
the
sake
of
writing
and
to
put
as
much
as
possible
into
this
last
letter
of
mine
ah
dearest
my
pet
my
own
darling
