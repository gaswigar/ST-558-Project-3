chapter
i
an
afternoon
tea
i
wish
i
had
a
twin
sister
said
patty
no
that
would
do
either
i
wish
i
were
twins
and
could
be
both
of
them
myself
what
a
sensible
wish
commented
nan
but
why
do
you
want
to
double
yourself
up
in
that
way
so
i
could
go
to
two
places
at
once
here
i
have
two
lovely
invitations
for
this
afternoon
and
i
do
know
which
i
want
to
accept
most
one
is
a
musicale
at
hastings
and
the
other
is
a
picture
exhibition
at
the
new
gallery
they
sound
delightful
ca
you
manage
to
go
to
both
no
they
too
far
apart
and
they
both
at
four
anyway
i
think
i
choose
the
musicale
for
i
surely
get
another
chance
to
see
the
pictures
yes
of
course
you
will
agreed
nan
a
little
absently
for
she
was
reading
some
newly
arrived
letters
the
fairfields
were
in
london
and
were
comfortably
established
in
the
savoy
hotel
it
was
april
and
though
they
intended
to
travel
later
in
the
summer
their
plans
were
as
yet
indefinite
and
they
were
enjoying
the
many
and
varied
delights
of
the
london
season
to
be
sure
nan
and
fairfield
were
invited
to
many
dinners
and
elaborate
entertainments
which
patty
was
too
young
to
attend
but
her
time
was
pleasantly
filled
with
afternoon
garden
parties
or
teas
while
mornings
were
often
devoted
to
patty
was
almost
eighteen
and
though
not
allowed
quite
the
untrammelled
freedom
she
would
have
had
in
america
she
was
not
kept
so
utterly
secluded
as
english
girls
of
her
age
sometimes
she
would
go
all
alone
to
westminster
abbey
or
to
the
national
gallery
and
enjoy
hugely
a
solitary
hour
or
two
at
other
times
nan
or
her
father
or
some
girl
friend
would
go
with
her
the
fairfields
had
begun
their
stay
in
london
with
only
a
few
friends
but
these
had
introduced
others
until
now
their
circle
of
acquaintances
was
large
and
the
immediate
result
of
this
was
a
sheaf
of
invitations
in
every
mail
for
during
the
season
londoners
are
hospitable
folk
and
give
entertainments
morning
noon
and
night
at
first
the
fairfields
had
thought
they
would
take
a
house
and
so
have
a
home
of
their
own
but
fairfield
concluded
that
if
nan
had
the
duties
of
a
housekeeper
her
trip
would
not
be
a
holiday
so
he
declared
they
would
live
at
a
large
hotel
and
thus
have
a
chance
to
observe
the
gay
life
of
london
and
so
cosy
and
comfortable
were
their
apartments
at
the
savoy
that
they
soon
began
to
feel
quite
at
home
there
and
patty
as
we
all
know
was
one
who
could
adapt
herself
to
any
mode
of
living
of
a
naturally
happy
and
contented
disposition
she
accepted
everything
as
it
came
and
enjoyed
everything
with
the
enthusiasm
so
often
seen
in
american
girls
it
greatly
amused
her
to
note
the
differences
between
herself
and
the
english
girls
to
her
mind
they
seemed
to
have
no
enthusiasm
no
enterprise
and
little
capacity
for
enjoyment
while
patty
enjoyed
every
experience
that
came
to
her
whether
a
visit
to
windsor
castle
a
day
at
stratford
or
a
simple
afternoon
tea
in
their
own
rooms
i
seem
to
have
been
set
back
two
or
three
years
she
said
to
nan
one
day
in
new
york
i
was
almost
a
young
lady
but
over
here
i
treated
as
a
little
girl
it
does
matter
said
nan
sensibly
you
are
what
you
are
and
if
the
different
countries
choose
to
treat
you
differently
it
matter
does
it
not
a
bit
i
patty
fairfield
and
i
almost
eighteen
whether
i
in
california
or
the
fiji
islands
but
it
does
amuse
me
the
way
the
londoners
think
we
live
at
home
they
really
believe
american
ladies
go
to
market
in
the
morning
loaded
down
with
diamonds
you
do
often
see
that
in
new
york
do
you
nan
no
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
new
york
matron
wearing
elaborate
jewelry
to
market
but
then
i
never
go
to
market
myself
and
i
do
know
many
people
who
do
i
think
that
bediamonded
marketer
story
is
an
old
tradition
which
is
really
pretty
well
worn
out
and
the
london
ladies
need
talk
anyway
if
we
did
wear
jewels
to
market
it
would
be
a
bit
more
absurd
than
the
way
they
dress
to
go
shopping
in
the
morning
long
trailing
frilly
gowns
of
pink
and
blue
chiffon
with
swishing
petticoats
that
just
drag
through
the
dirt
of
the
streets
now
are
you
criticising
them
as
unfairly
as
they
describe
us
no
for
what
i
say
is
true
i
seen
them
fluttering
about
and
anyway
i
do
mean
to
be
mean
i
like
them
lots
i
just
love
the
london
ladies
they
so
kind
to
me
and
invite
me
to
such
lovely
things
of
course
i
do
care
if
they
choose
to
wear
clothes
along
bond
street
we
all
have
some
ridiculous
ways
pretty
patty
was
fond
of
pretty
clothes
and
the
shops
of
bond
street
held
great
attractions
for
her
though
she
herself
wore
a
real
costume
when
shopping
at
first
nan
had
exercised
a
supervision
over
her
purchases
but
patty
had
shown
such
good
taste
and
such
quick
and
unerring
judgment
as
to
fabrics
and
colors
that
it
had
come
about
that
patty
more
often
advised
nan
in
her
choosing
than
the
other
way
and
so
many
a
pleasant
morning
was
spent
in
the
beautiful
london
shops
buying
things
they
wanted
looking
at
things
they
did
not
want
or
noting
with
interest
the
ways
and
means
peculiar
to
english
shopkeepers
thus
the
days
went
happily
by
and
they
had
already
been
more
than
a
fortnight
in
london
while
as
yet
their
plans
for
future
travel
were
unmade
and
fairfield
wanted
to
go
to
germany
switzerland
and
other
countries
but
patty
did
care
so
much
for
that
as
for
english
country
or
small
nearby
towns
so
the
matter
was
left
unsettled
though
short
and
desultory
discussions
were
held
now
and
then
but
oftener
their
minds
were
taken
up
with
the
doings
of
the
moment
and
they
complacently
left
the
future
to
itself
well
then
i
think
i
go
to
the
musicale
said
patty
what
would
you
wear
that
new
light
blue
chiffon
of
yours
with
the
lace
bolero
is
just
the
thing
yes
and
my
new
chip
hat
with
the
roses
piled
all
over
it
patty
ran
away
to
her
own
room
and
after
a
time
returned
in
the
pretty
summer
costume
how
do
i
look
she
asked
smilingly
of
nan
nan
smiled
back
at
the
lovely
vision
for
patty
vanity
was
of
a
mild
and
innocent
sort
and
was
rather
a
childish
delight
in
dainty
colors
and
fabrics
than
any
conceit
over
her
own
beauty
for
beautiful
patty
certainly
was
in
a
sweet
wholesome
girlish
way
and
not
the
least
of
her
charms
was
her
naturalness
of
manner
and
her
entire
lack
of
she
looked
especially
winning
in
the
light
filmy
dress
and
the
big
hat
weighed
down
with
roses
you
look
all
right
patty
answered
nan
that
a
duck
of
a
frock
and
suits
you
perfectly
are
you
going
alone
yes
father
says
i
may
go
alone
in
our
own
carriage
to
any
afternoon
thing
the
hartleys
will
bring
me
home
so
i
send
the
carriage
back
for
you
yes
i
wish
you
would
i
going
to
a
tea
or
two
and
then
we
dining
out
you
to
dine
with
the
hartleys
are
you
yes
if
it
is
dinner
it
more
likely
to
be
schoolroom
tea
mabel
hartley
is
sixteen
but
i
doubt
if
she
allowed
at
dinner
yet
nonsense
of
course
she
is
well
then
if
they
sending
you
home
louise
need
go
after
you
no
they
send
somebody
nan
patty
have
a
lovely
time
oh
yes
i
always
do
away
went
patty
and
her
frills
and
when
she
reached
chesterton
mansions
she
was
soon
established
under
the
wing
of
her
hostess
hastings
that
lady
was
very
glad
to
have
the
pretty
american
girl
as
her
guest
and
she
introduced
patty
to
so
many
people
that
it
was
almost
bewildering
but
after
a
time
the
music
began
and
patty
was
glad
to
sit
still
and
listen
it
was
very
fine
music
for
that
is
the
sort
that
londoners
usually
offer
at
their
teas
and
patty
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
singing
and
the
she
was
a
little
afraid
that
hastings
would
ask
her
to
sing
but
as
it
was
a
programme
of
professionals
this
did
not
happen
when
the
hartleys
came
mabel
at
once
made
her
way
to
patty
side
and
sat
down
by
her
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
she
said
and
it
so
lovely
that
going
home
with
us
i
glad
too
returned
patty
it
was
lovely
of
you
to
ask
me
mabel
hartley
was
an
english
girl
and
was
about
as
different
from
patty
as
could
well
be
imagined
and
perhaps
for
this
reason
the
two
were
very
good
friends
although
they
had
met
only
a
few
times
they
liked
each
other
from
the
beginning
and
both
were
ready
to
continue
the
friendship
mabel
was
large
and
stout
with
the
solidity
which
characterises
the
british
young
girls
she
was
and
not
very
graceful
but
she
carried
herself
with
a
patrician
air
that
told
of
past
generations
of
her
complexion
was
of
that
pure
pink
and
white
seen
only
on
english
faces
but
her
pale
sandy
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
failed
to
add
the
deeper
color
that
was
needed
her
frock
was
an
uninteresting
shade
of
tan
and
did
not
hang
evenly
while
her
hat
was
one
of
those
tubby
affairs
little
short
of
ridiculous
patty
fairly
ached
to
her
in
some
pretty
clear
color
and
a
becoming
hat
the
girls
were
politely
silent
while
the
music
was
going
on
but
in
the
intervals
between
the
numbers
they
chattered
glibly
that
grace
meredith
and
her
brother
tom
just
coming
in
said
mabel
i
hope
they
come
over
here
you
like
them
i
know
the
merediths
did
come
over
and
were
promptly
introduced
to
patty
do
you
know
said
tom
meredith
as
he
shook
hands
in
cordial
boyish
fashion
you
the
first
american
girl
i
ever
met
am
i
really
laughed
patty
now
do
ask
me
if
we
always
wear
our
diamonds
to
market
for
truly
the
american
women
who
go
to
market
rarely
have
any
diamonds
i
never
believed
that
diamond
story
anyway
responded
tom
gravely
but
i
glad
to
have
you
tell
me
it
is
true
i
perfectly
unprejudiced
about
america
though
i
ready
to
believe
it
the
best
country
in
the
world
outside
of
our
own
little
island
good
for
you
cried
patty
then
i
ready
to
acknowledge
that
i
like
england
next
best
to
america
have
you
been
here
long
asked
grace
no
only
about
two
weeks
but
i
love
london
better
every
day
and
i
know
i
shall
love
the
english
country
just
the
glimpse
i
caught
coming
in
the
train
from
dover
was
delightful
you
should
see
the
hartleys
country
place
declared
tom
with
enthusiasm
it
a
ripping
old
house
two
hundred
years
old
and
all
that
and
such
parks
and
orchards
well
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
it
patty
said
mabel
a
little
wistfully
and
patty
wondered
why
the
girl
tone
had
in
it
a
note
of
sadness
but
just
then
as
the
music
was
over
hastings
asked
them
to
go
to
the
and
the
group
of
young
people
followed
in
her
wake
you
girls
sit
here
said
tom
selecting
a
alcove
with
and
red
cushions
while
i
stalk
some
food
he
was
back
in
a
few
moments
followed
by
a
waiter
who
brought
a
tray
of
teacups
and
plates
of
sweet
cakes
tom
himself
bore
triumphantly
a
covered
silver
dish
muffins
he
announced
in
a
jubilant
voice
hot
buttered
muffins
crickets
what
luck
the
hot
muffins
buttered
and
quartered
were
indeed
delicious
and
england
and
america
seemed
at
one
in
showing
an
appreciative
appetite
for
them
we
do
have
these
in
america
said
patty
surveying
her
bit
of
muffin
with
admiration
we
have
good
sandwiches
though
we
almost
never
have
sandwiches
said
grace
you
do
need
to
said
patty
quickly
your
wonderful
bread
and
butter
is
too
good
to
be
spoiled
with
a
sandwich
filling
of
any
sort
all
things
are
good
eating
at
an
afternoon
tea
observed
tom
somehow
at
five
i
always
so
hungry
i
could
eat
a
brickbat
if
it
were
toasted
and
buttered
afternoon
tea
is
really
an
acquired
taste
with
us
said
patty
you
seem
to
have
it
naturally
even
when
you
alone
but
we
only
have
it
when
we
have
guests
really
said
mabel
in
astonishment
why
we
as
soon
think
of
omitting
breakfast
or
dinner
as
tea
it
a
lovely
meal
said
patty
giving
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
as
her
last
crumb
of
muffin
disappeared
such
good
things
to
eat
and
then
it
so
cosy
and
informal
to
sit
around
in
easy
chairs
instead
of
at
a
big
table
but
the
ideal
place
for
tea
is
on
the
lawn
said
tom
the
open
air
and
the
trees
and
birds
and
flowers
are
even
a
better
setting
for
it
than
an
interior
like
this
i
hope
i
shall
have
that
kind
this
summer
said
patty
i
invited
to
several
country
houses
and
i
know
i
shall
enjoy
it
immensely
indeed
you
will
said
mabel
and
again
patty
thought
she
detected
a
shade
of
sadness
in
her
friend
eyes
but
if
mabel
was
not
exactly
gay
grace
meredith
made
up
for
it
she
was
full
of
fun
and
laughter
and
both
she
and
tom
made
comical
speeches
until
patty
feared
she
would
disgrace
herself
laughing
what
the
joke
asked
hartley
coming
to
collect
her
young
people
and
take
them
home
tom
is
making
verses
about
the
people
here
explained
grace
tell
hartley
the
one
about
the
violinist
tom
do
think
it
rude
hartley
said
young
meredith
truly
it
is
meant
to
be
but
for
that
genius
with
his
chrysanthemum
of
hair
is
this
a
pleasant
token
of
regard
and
esteem
this
is
our
latest
social
lion
so
to
look
modest
he
tryin
and
tryin
it
very
beautiful
said
hartley
smiling
and
i
daresay
professor
prendergast
would
enjoy
it
himself
were
he
to
hear
it
he
might
said
tom
doubtfully
but
musicians
rarely
have
a
sense
of
humour
at
least
about
themselves
that
true
agreed
hartley
and
now
mabel
and
miss
fairfield
we
must
be
going
on
were
soon
said
and
in
the
hartleys
carriage
patty
was
taken
away
to
her
first
visit
in
an
english
home
chapter
ii
riddles
and
games
much
to
patty
satisfaction
mabel
hartley
was
in
the
habit
of
dining
with
her
elders
and
was
not
condemned
to
schoolroom
tea
the
family
was
not
large
consisting
only
of
hartley
her
mother
cromarty
her
two
sons
and
mabel
the
sons
sinclair
and
robert
were
big
stalwart
fellows
a
few
years
older
than
mabel
patty
liked
them
at
once
for
they
were
cordial
and
hearty
in
their
greetings
and
quite
at
ease
in
their
conversation
i
say
mater
began
bob
after
they
were
seated
at
dinner
there
a
stunning
on
at
regent
park
next
week
do
you
think
we
can
all
go
tickets
only
two
shillings
each
what
is
it
my
son
a
charity
affair
yes
rest
cure
for
or
something
but
they
all
sorts
of
jolly
shows
and
the
stagefright
club
is
going
to
give
a
little
original
play
oh
say
we
go
i
see
about
it
answered
hartley
perhaps
if
we
make
up
a
party
miss
fairfield
will
go
with
us
i
love
to
said
patty
i
never
seen
a
real
english
garden
party
oh
this
is
a
real
english
garden
party
in
the
true
sense
said
sinclair
to
see
that
you
must
be
in
the
country
but
this
is
a
public
london
garden
party
and
typical
of
its
sort
you
like
it
i
sure
will
you
go
with
us
grandy
at
first
it
seemed
incongruous
to
patty
to
hear
the
dignified
cromarty
addressed
by
such
a
nickname
but
as
she
came
to
know
her
better
the
name
seemed
really
appropriate
the
lady
was
of
the
class
known
as
and
her
white
hair
and
delicate
features
betokened
a
high
type
of
english
aristocracy
her
voice
was
very
sweet
and
gentle
and
she
smiled
at
her
big
grandson
as
she
replied
no
my
boy
i
lost
my
taste
for
garden
parties
some
years
ago
but
a
fine
setting
for
you
young
people
and
i
hope
emmeline
will
take
you
all
mother
said
she
see
about
it
said
mabel
and
that
always
the
same
as
if
it
going
to
be
she
says
think
it
over
it
a
great
thing
to
understand
your
so
well
said
patty
laughing
now
i
should
have
known
those
distinctions
we
have
a
wonderful
talent
for
languages
said
sinclair
gravely
indeed
we
have
a
language
of
our
own
shall
i
teach
it
to
you
you
might
try
said
patty
but
i
not
at
all
clever
as
a
linguist
you
may
not
learn
it
easily
but
it
can
be
taught
in
one
sentence
it
consists
in
merely
using
the
initial
of
the
word
instead
of
the
word
itself
but
so
many
words
begin
with
the
same
initial
said
patty
bewildered
at
the
idea
yes
but
it
ever
so
much
easier
than
you
think
now
listen
you
understand
me
if
i
said
y
w
t
g
t
t
g
p
say
it
again
please
and
say
it
slowly
sinclair
repeated
the
letters
and
patty
clapped
her
hands
crying
yes
yes
of
course
i
understand
you
mean
you
want
to
go
to
the
garden
party
now
listen
to
me
while
i
answer
y
i
w
t
g
i
i
d
good
exclaimed
mabel
you
said
i
want
to
go
if
it
rain
oh
you
are
a
quick
pupil
but
those
are
such
easy
sentences
said
patty
as
she
considered
the
matter
that
the
point
said
bob
most
sentences
at
least
the
ones
we
use
most
easy
if
i
should
meet
you
unexpectedly
and
say
h
d
y
d
you
know
i
meant
how
do
you
do
or
if
i
took
leave
and
said
g
b
understand
those
are
the
simplest
possible
examples
now
on
the
other
hand
if
i
were
to
read
you
a
long
speech
from
the
morning
paper
you
probably
miss
many
of
the
long
words
but
that
the
other
extreme
we
talked
in
initials
for
years
and
rarely
are
we
uncertain
as
to
the
sense
though
we
may
sometimes
skip
a
word
here
and
there
but
what
good
is
it
asked
patty
no
good
at
all
admitted
bob
but
it
fun
and
after
you
used
to
it
you
can
talk
that
way
so
fast
that
any
one
listening
could
guess
what
you
are
saying
sometimes
when
we
riding
on
an
omnibus
or
anything
like
that
it
fun
to
talk
initials
and
mystify
the
people
d
y
o
d
t
said
patty
her
eyes
twinkling
yes
we
often
do
that
returned
bob
greatly
gratified
at
the
rapid
progress
of
the
new
pupil
you
must
be
fond
of
puzzles
to
catch
this
up
so
quickly
i
am
said
patty
i
guessed
puzzles
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
always
solve
all
i
can
find
in
the
papers
and
sometimes
i
take
prizes
for
them
we
do
that
too
said
mabel
and
sometimes
we
make
puzzles
and
send
them
to
the
papers
and
they
print
them
let
make
some
for
each
other
this
evening
after
dinner
the
young
people
gathered
round
the
table
in
the
pleasant
library
and
were
soon
busy
with
paper
and
pencils
patty
found
the
hartleys
a
match
for
her
in
quickness
and
ingenuity
but
she
was
able
to
guess
as
great
a
proportion
of
their
puzzles
as
they
of
hers
after
amusing
themselves
with
square
words
and
double
acrostics
they
drifted
to
conundrums
and
bob
asked
which
letter
of
the
dutch
alphabet
spells
an
english
lady
of
rank
that
not
fair
objected
patty
because
i
do
know
the
dutch
alphabet
that
does
matter
said
mabel
you
can
guess
it
just
as
well
without
indeed
i
ca
and
besides
i
do
know
the
names
of
all
the
english
ladies
of
rank
that
does
matter
either
said
sinclair
smiling
it
spells
a
title
not
a
name
and
one
you
know
very
well
i
ca
guess
it
anyway
said
patty
after
a
few
moment
thought
i
give
it
up
tell
me
why
dutch
s
said
bob
and
patty
agreed
that
it
was
a
good
catch
now
i
catch
you
said
patty
you
all
know
your
london
pretty
well
i
suppose
and
are
familiar
with
the
places
of
interest
well
mabel
why
is
your
nose
like
st
paul
mabel
thought
hard
and
so
did
the
boys
is
my
nose
like
paul
too
asked
bob
thoughtfully
stroking
his
feature
patty
looked
at
it
critically
yes
she
said
and
so
is
sinclair
but
why
at
last
they
gave
it
up
and
patty
said
triumphantly
because
it
is
made
of
flesh
and
blood
they
all
screamed
with
laughter
for
they
quickly
saw
the
point
and
realised
that
it
was
the
historic
character
referred
to
and
not
the
cathedral
here
one
said
sinclair
where
did
the
prince
of
wales
go
on
his
eleventh
birthday
but
patty
was
quite
quick
enough
for
this
into
his
twelfth
year
she
answered
promptly
and
now
listen
to
this
a
man
walking
out
at
night
met
a
beggar
asking
alms
the
man
gave
him
ten
cents
he
met
another
beggar
and
gave
him
fifteen
cents
what
time
was
it
time
for
him
to
go
home
declared
bob
but
patty
said
that
was
not
the
right
answer
springtime
guessed
mabel
because
the
man
was
in
such
a
good
humor
no
said
patty
it
was
quarter
to
two
her
hearers
looked
utterly
blank
at
this
and
suddenly
realising
that
they
were
not
very
familiar
with
american
coins
patty
explained
the
joke
they
saw
it
of
course
but
seemed
to
think
it
not
very
good
and
sinclair
whimsically
insisted
on
calling
it
a
shilling
to
bob
which
he
said
was
equally
nonsensical
give
us
one
of
your
poetry
ones
grandy
said
bob
to
cromarty
who
sat
by
quietly
enjoying
the
young
people
fun
miss
fairfield
may
not
care
for
the
enigma
but
i
will
offer
this
one
and
in
her
fine
clear
voice
the
old
lady
recited
her
verse
with
elocutionary
effect
afloat
upon
the
ocean
my
graceful
form
you
see
the
protector
of
the
people
the
protector
of
a
tree
i
often
save
a
patient
though
a
doctor
i
am
not
my
name
is
very
easy
can
you
tell
me
children
what
the
others
had
heard
this
before
and
when
patty
promptly
guessed
bark
cromarty
was
distinctly
pleased
with
her
then
lemonade
and
wafery
little
cakes
were
brought
in
that
the
puzzlers
might
refresh
themselves
the
atmosphere
of
the
hartley
household
was
very
pleasant
and
patty
felt
much
more
at
home
than
she
had
ever
expected
to
feel
among
english
people
she
made
allusion
to
this
and
bob
said
oh
this
place
homey
at
all
compared
with
our
real
home
you
must
come
to
see
us
down
in
the
country
must
she
mother
i
should
be
very
glad
to
welcome
you
there
my
dear
said
hartley
smiling
at
patty
and
i
trust
it
may
be
arranged
we
have
this
apartment
for
only
a
few
weeks
longer
and
then
we
shall
go
back
to
leicester
i
in
no
haste
to
go
declared
mabel
i
love
cromarty
manor
but
i
want
to
stay
in
london
a
little
longer
but
when
we
do
go
patty
you
surely
must
visit
us
there
indeed
i
will
if
i
can
manage
it
my
parents
want
me
to
go
with
them
to
switzerland
but
i
much
prefer
to
spend
the
summer
in
england
i
have
ever
so
many
delightful
invitations
to
country
houses
and
they
seem
to
me
a
lot
more
attractive
than
travelling
about
i
suppose
i
ought
to
care
more
about
seeing
places
but
i
do
you
quite
young
enough
yet
said
hartley
to
look
forward
to
travelling
in
future
years
i
think
some
experiences
of
english
life
would
be
quite
as
advantageous
for
you
i
tell
father
you
said
that
said
patty
then
perhaps
he
let
me
have
my
own
way
but
he
usually
does
that
anyway
you
love
cromarty
manor
said
bob
enthusiastically
it
so
beautiful
in
spring
and
early
summer
but
not
half
as
grand
as
other
houses
where
patty
invited
said
mabel
and
again
the
shadow
crossed
her
face
that
seemed
always
to
come
when
she
spoke
of
her
country
home
grandeur
does
count
in
the
country
declared
bob
that
belongs
to
london
life
other
places
may
be
larger
or
in
better
condition
than
ours
but
they
be
more
beautiful
that
is
true
said
cromarty
in
her
quiet
way
which
always
seemed
to
decide
a
disputed
point
and
then
it
was
time
to
go
home
and
hartley
sent
patty
away
in
her
carriage
with
a
maid
to
accompany
her
the
woman
was
with
a
pleasant
voice
and
a
capable
manner
she
chatted
affably
with
patty
and
dilated
a
little
on
the
glories
of
the
cromarty
family
patty
realised
at
once
that
she
was
an
old
family
servant
and
had
earned
a
right
to
a
little
more
freedom
of
speech
than
is
usual
to
english
domestics
oh
yes
miss
she
said
it
a
wonnerful
old
place
that
it
is
and
if
the
dear
lady
only
the
money
as
is
by
right
she
keep
it
up
lordly
that
she
would
patty
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
money
in
question
but
sarah
said
no
more
concerning
it
and
patty
felt
she
had
no
right
to
ask
you
live
with
them
then
in
the
country
she
said
yes
miss
i
allus
lived
with
them
my
mother
was
housekeeper
at
the
manor
when
miss
emmeline
married
oh
he
was
the
fine
gentleman
dead
now
this
ten
year
come
whitsuntide
master
bob
he
the
image
of
his
father
are
you
warm
enough
miss
sarah
quick
transit
from
reminiscences
to
solicitude
for
her
comfort
almost
startled
patty
but
she
was
getting
used
to
that
peculiarity
of
the
british
mind
yes
thank
you
she
said
and
anyway
we
home
now
here
the
savoy
fairfield
and
nan
had
not
yet
arrived
so
the
good
sarah
attended
patty
to
her
own
apartment
and
gave
her
over
to
louise
who
awaited
her
coming
louise
helped
her
off
with
her
pretty
frock
and
brought
her
a
beribboned
négligée
and
patty
curled
up
in
a
big
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
to
think
over
the
evening
these
are
lovely
she
said
to
herself
and
they
do
have
most
comfortable
stuffed
chairs
over
here
if
they
only
knew
enough
to
put
rockers
under
them
patty
was
a
creature
and
often
bewailed
the
absence
of
the
so
dear
to
her
american
heart
soon
her
parents
came
in
and
found
her
sound
asleep
in
the
big
chair
she
woke
up
as
her
father
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
forehead
hello
prince
charming
she
said
smiling
gaily
at
the
handsome
man
in
evening
clothes
who
stood
looking
down
at
her
i
suppose
you
want
a
return
compliment
about
the
sleeping
beauty
he
said
but
you
wo
get
it
too
much
flattery
is
good
for
a
baby
like
you
and
i
shall
reserve
my
pretty
speeches
for
my
wife
oh
i
share
them
with
patty
laughed
nan
but
with
no
one
else
tell
us
about
your
evening
girlie
said
her
father
did
you
have
a
good
time
fine
said
patty
the
hartleys
are
lovely
people
i
like
them
better
than
any
i
met
in
london
so
far
and
they
do
puzzles
and
ask
riddles
and
they
just
as
clever
and
quick
as
americans
i
heard
that
english
people
were
heavy
and
stupid
and
they
not
a
bit
you
must
believe
all
you
hear
are
they
a
large
family
not
very
two
sons
one
daughter
and
the
mother
and
grandmother
mabel
father
has
been
dead
for
years
and
they
want
me
to
visit
them
at
their
home
in
leicester
this
summer
ca
i
go
desert
your
own
family
for
foreigners
yes
i
do
want
to
go
there
and
to
some
other
country
places
while
you
and
nan
go
touristing
about
may
i
we
wo
decide
now
it
too
near
midnight
for
important
matters
to
be
discussed
skip
to
bed
chickabiddy
and
dream
of
the
stars
and
stripes
lest
you
forget
them
entirely
never
cried
patty
striking
a
dramatic
attitude
though
english
people
may
be
grand
my
heart
is
in
my
native
land
and
humming
the
banner
she
went
away
to
her
own
room
chapter
iii
the
white
lady
i
feel
in
a
gay
mood
said
nan
as
she
clasped
patty
round
the
waist
and
always
ready
for
a
dance
patty
fell
into
step
and
the
two
waltzed
round
the
room
while
patty
sang
to
the
air
of
a
popular
song
as
if
you
two
ever
felt
any
other
way
exclaimed
fairfield
smiling
at
them
from
the
depths
of
his
easy
chair
but
what
does
this
gay
mood
betoken
i
suppose
you
want
to
drag
me
out
to
the
theatre
or
opera
fairfield
pleasant
smile
belied
his
pretense
at
sharpness
and
he
waited
to
hear
a
reply
that
would
be
lovely
said
nan
and
we
go
if
you
invite
us
but
what
i
had
in
mind
is
this
i
like
to
dine
in
the
restaurant
good
cried
fairfield
i
feel
gay
enough
for
that
myself
and
we
have
dined
there
for
nearly
a
week
the
fairfields
had
a
complete
apartment
of
their
own
and
when
not
invited
out
usually
dined
quietly
in
their
own
but
occasionally
when
the
mood
took
them
they
dined
in
the
great
savoy
restaurant
which
was
a
festive
pageant
indeed
patty
loved
to
sit
at
a
table
there
and
watch
the
beautiful
women
in
their
elaborate
gowns
and
their
handsome
stalwart
escorts
who
were
sometimes
in
brave
uniforms
the
splendid
scene
would
have
palled
upon
them
had
they
dined
there
every
evening
but
as
a
change
from
their
small
family
dinner
it
was
delightful
we
wear
our
frocks
said
patty
and
perhaps
my
white
lady
will
be
there
again
your
white
lady
asked
nan
who
is
she
that
just
what
i
ca
find
out
though
i
asked
several
people
but
she
the
most
beautiful
lady
with
a
haughty
proud
face
and
sad
eyes
she
always
wears
white
and
there
an
elderly
lady
who
is
sometimes
with
her
a
old
lady
in
black
she
is
and
her
face
is
like
a
hawk
oh
i
remember
those
people
they
always
sit
at
the
same
table
yes
i
think
they
live
here
but
she
is
so
sweet
and
lovely
i
like
to
know
her
i
make
up
stories
about
her
all
to
myself
she
like
ginevra
or
the
lady
of
shalott
you
too
fanciful
patty
probably
she
the
duchess
of
hardscrabble
she
looks
like
a
duchess
anyway
and
also
she
looks
like
a
simple
sweet
lovely
lady
i
going
to
ask
father
to
find
out
who
she
is
a
little
later
the
fairfields
went
down
to
dinner
nan
wore
an
exquisite
gown
of
embroidered
yellow
satin
and
patty
wore
a
frilled
white
silk
muslin
it
was
a
little
low
at
the
throat
and
was
very
becoming
to
her
and
in
and
out
of
her
curls
was
twisted
a
broad
white
ribbon
which
ended
in
front
in
a
saucy
cluster
of
bows
after
the
prevailing
fashion
this
is
great
fun
said
patty
as
she
took
her
seat
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
i
just
love
the
lights
and
flowers
and
music
and
noise
can
you
distinguish
the
music
from
the
noise
asked
her
father
laughing
i
can
if
i
try
but
i
do
care
whether
i
do
or
not
i
love
the
whole
conglomeration
of
sounds
people
laughing
and
talking
and
a
sort
of
undertone
of
glass
and
china
and
waiters
that
sounds
graphic
said
nan
but
the
waiters
here
are
supposed
to
make
any
noise
no
i
know
it
but
they
just
part
of
the
whole
scene
and
it
all
beautiful
together
oh
there
my
white
lady
it
was
indeed
a
charming
young
woman
who
was
just
entering
the
room
she
was
tall
and
very
slender
with
a
face
serene
and
sweet
her
large
dark
eyes
had
a
look
of
resignation
rather
than
sadness
but
the
firm
set
of
her
scarlet
lips
did
not
betoken
an
nature
with
her
was
the
elder
lady
of
whom
patty
had
spoken
she
was
and
looked
as
if
she
were
she
wore
a
rather
severe
evening
gown
of
black
net
and
in
her
gray
hair
was
a
quivering
black
aigrette
in
contrast
to
this
dark
figure
the
younger
lady
looked
specially
fair
and
sweet
her
trailing
gown
was
of
heavy
white
lace
and
round
her
beautiful
throat
were
two
long
strings
of
pearls
she
wore
no
other
ornament
save
for
a
white
flower
in
her
hair
and
her
shoulders
and
arms
were
almost
as
white
as
the
soft
tulle
that
billowed
against
them
it
chanced
that
fairfield
table
was
quite
near
the
one
usually
occupied
by
these
two
and
patty
watched
the
white
lady
without
seeming
to
stare
at
her
is
she
exquisite
she
said
at
last
for
they
were
not
within
earshot
and
nan
agreed
that
she
was
as
the
dinner
proceeded
patty
glanced
often
at
the
lady
of
her
admiration
and
after
a
time
was
surprised
and
a
little
embarrassed
to
find
that
the
white
lady
was
glancing
at
her
fearing
she
had
stared
more
frankly
than
she
realised
patty
refrained
from
looking
at
the
lady
again
and
resolutely
kept
her
eyes
turned
in
other
directions
but
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnet
she
felt
impelled
to
look
at
her
once
more
and
giving
a
quick
glance
she
saw
the
white
lady
distinctly
smiling
at
her
there
was
no
mistake
it
was
a
kind
amused
little
smile
of
a
most
friendly
nature
patty
was
enchanted
and
the
warm
blood
rushed
to
her
cheeks
as
if
she
had
been
singled
out
for
a
great
honour
but
frankly
and
without
embarrassment
she
smiled
back
at
the
lovely
face
and
returned
the
pleased
little
nod
that
was
then
given
her
patty
what
you
doing
said
nan
do
you
see
any
one
you
know
no
said
patty
slowly
almost
as
one
in
a
dream
my
white
lady
smiled
at
me
that
all
so
i
smiled
back
at
her
and
then
we
bowed
you
must
do
such
things
said
nan
half
smiling
herself
think
you
a
forward
american
i
am
an
american
replied
patty
and
i
be
sorry
to
be
called
backward
you
never
will
be
said
her
father
well
i
suppose
you
may
smile
at
her
if
she
smiles
first
but
do
begin
sending
her
anonymous
notes
nonsense
said
patty
but
you
two
do
know
how
lovely
she
is
when
she
smiles
and
fairfield
were
seated
with
their
backs
to
the
lady
in
question
and
could
not
see
her
without
slightly
turning
their
heads
while
patty
opposite
them
at
the
round
table
faced
her
directly
you
fortunate
in
your
position
observed
her
father
for
were
you
seated
here
and
we
there
of
course
she
would
have
beamed
upon
us
she
is
beaming
cried
patty
almost
indignantly
i
wo
have
that
angelic
smile
called
a
beam
now
you
not
to
tease
she
a
sweet
dear
lady
with
some
awful
tragedy
gnawing
at
her
heart
patty
you
growing
up
romantic
stop
it
at
once
i
buy
the
lady
for
you
if
you
want
her
but
i
wo
have
you
indulging
in
rubbishy
romance
like
that
with
nothing
to
base
it
on
patty
looked
at
her
father
comically
i
do
believe
you
better
buy
her
daddy
dear
she
said
you
know
you
often
say
that
with
nan
and
me
on
your
hands
you
have
all
you
can
manage
so
i
sure
you
could
add
those
two
to
your
collection
for
i
feel
certain
wherever
the
white
lady
goes
the
black
lady
goes
too
the
subject
was
lost
sight
of
then
by
the
greetings
of
some
friends
who
were
passing
by
the
fairfields
on
their
way
out
of
the
restaurant
why
leigh
exclaimed
nan
how
do
you
do
wo
you
and
leigh
sit
down
and
have
coffee
with
us
or
better
yet
suppose
we
all
go
up
to
our
and
have
coffee
there
after
patty
had
spoken
to
the
newcomers
and
was
sitting
silent
while
her
elders
were
talking
she
looked
up
in
surprise
as
a
waiter
approached
her
he
laid
a
white
rose
beside
her
plate
and
said
quietly
from
lady
hamilton
miss
involuntarily
patty
glanced
at
the
white
lady
and
seeing
her
smile
knew
at
once
that
she
had
sent
the
rose
as
patty
explained
the
presence
of
the
flower
to
the
others
leigh
glanced
across
and
said
oh
that
lady
hamilton
excuse
me
i
must
speak
to
her
just
a
moment
who
is
lady
hamilton
asked
nan
of
leigh
unable
longer
to
repress
her
interest
one
of
the
best
and
most
beautiful
women
in
london
he
replied
one
of
the
most
indifferent
and
the
most
sought
after
one
of
the
richest
and
the
saddest
one
of
the
most
popular
and
the
loneliest
all
this
seemed
enough
to
verify
patty
surmises
of
romance
connected
with
the
white
lady
but
before
she
could
ask
a
question
leigh
returned
and
lady
hamilton
came
with
her
after
introductions
and
a
few
words
of
greeting
lady
hamilton
said
to
fairfield
i
wonder
if
you
could
be
induced
to
lend
me
your
daughter
for
an
hour
or
so
i
will
do
my
best
to
entertain
her
indeed
yes
lady
hamilton
and
i
think
you
will
find
her
quite
ready
to
be
borrowed
you
seemed
to
cast
a
magic
spell
over
her
even
before
she
knew
your
name
i
must
confess
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
meet
her
i
have
searched
this
room
in
vain
for
some
mutual
friend
who
might
introduce
us
but
until
i
saw
leigh
over
here
i
could
find
no
one
then
to
attract
leigh
attention
in
hope
of
her
helping
me
i
sent
over
a
signal
of
distress
i
took
it
as
a
flag
of
truce
said
patty
holding
up
the
white
rose
as
it
trembled
on
its
stem
i
thought
it
was
a
cipher
message
said
nan
smiling
patty
is
so
fond
of
puzzles
and
secret
languages
i
was
sure
but
it
might
mean
is
discovered
fly
at
once
it
means
is
well
said
lady
hamilton
in
her
gracious
way
and
now
i
must
fly
at
once
with
my
spoil
she
took
possession
of
patty
and
with
a
few
words
of
adieu
to
the
others
led
her
from
the
room
the
lady
in
black
rose
from
the
table
and
followed
them
and
patty
entered
the
lift
blissfully
happy
but
a
little
bewildered
we
have
our
coffee
right
here
said
lady
hamilton
as
having
reached
her
she
proceeded
to
adjust
some
dainty
gilt
cups
that
stood
on
a
small
table
that
is
if
you
are
allowed
to
have
coffee
at
night
from
your
roseleaf
cheeks
i
fancy
you
drink
only
honeydew
or
buttercup
tea
no
indeed
i
far
too
substantial
for
those
things
said
patty
as
she
dropped
into
the
cosy
chair
lady
hamilton
had
indicated
and
for
over
a
year
now
i
been
allowed
to
have
coffee
dear
me
what
a
miss
fairfield
this
is
betham
my
very
good
friend
who
looks
after
me
when
i
get
frisky
and
try
to
scrape
acquaintance
across
a
public
if
lady
hamilton
was
lovely
when
she
was
silent
she
was
doubly
bewitching
when
she
talked
in
this
gay
strain
little
dimples
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
so
quickly
that
they
had
scarcely
disappeared
before
they
were
back
again
betham
bowed
and
spoke
politely
to
patty
but
her
voice
was
quick
and
sharp
and
her
manner
though
courteous
was
not
attractive
i
doubt
the
coffee
hot
she
said
as
a
waiter
who
had
just
brought
it
in
was
filling
the
tiny
cups
it
steaming
said
lady
hamilton
gaily
and
patty
saw
at
once
that
whatever
it
was
that
made
her
new
friend
sorrowful
it
was
not
the
grumbling
tones
of
betham
it
quite
too
hot
julia
she
went
on
unless
you
careful
steam
your
throat
not
i
growled
betham
i
not
such
a
stupid
as
that
but
i
must
say
i
like
my
coffee
at
a
table
like
a
christian
and
not
setting
my
cup
in
my
lap
or
holding
it
up
in
the
air
dear
me
julia
said
lady
hamilton
with
great
solicitude
expressed
on
her
face
dear
me
your
gout
must
be
very
bad
it
makes
you
quite
cross
poor
dear
betham
sniffed
at
this
but
a
grim
smile
came
into
her
eyes
and
patty
concluded
she
was
not
quite
so
grumpy
as
she
seemed
after
the
coffee
was
finished
and
the
tray
taken
away
betham
excused
herself
and
went
off
to
her
own
room
the
way
it
began
said
lady
hamilton
as
if
to
explain
her
interest
in
patty
was
one
day
when
i
went
through
the
corridors
and
passed
your
and
the
door
was
a
little
mite
ajar
and
i
heard
you
singing
i
am
very
fond
of
just
that
high
sweet
kind
of
voice
that
you
have
and
i
paused
a
few
moments
to
listen
to
you
then
afterward
i
saw
you
in
the
two
or
three
times
at
luncheon
or
dinner
and
i
took
a
fancy
to
know
you
for
i
felt
sure
i
should
like
you
do
you
mind
coming
to
see
me
once
in
a
while
my
dear
i
am
very
lonely
mind
no
indeed
cried
patty
impetuously
throwing
her
arms
around
her
new
friend
i
loved
you
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
but
why
do
you
say
you
are
lonely
you
a
great
lady
i
will
tell
you
my
story
in
a
few
words
said
lady
hamilton
for
i
suppose
you
would
hear
it
from
others
and
i
would
rather
tell
it
you
myself
i
am
the
daughter
of
sir
otho
markleham
of
course
if
you
were
a
londoner
you
would
know
all
this
but
as
you
not
i
tell
you
well
i
am
sir
otho
only
daughter
and
four
years
ago
when
i
was
just
eighteen
i
ran
away
from
home
and
married
lord
cecil
hamilton
he
was
a
good
man
but
he
had
quarrelled
with
my
father
on
a
point
of
politics
and
my
father
disapproved
of
the
match
he
disowned
me
as
his
daughter
though
he
said
he
would
always
continue
the
allowance
i
had
had
as
a
girl
i
was
glad
of
this
not
only
because
lord
hamilton
though
a
man
of
good
fortune
was
not
a
wealthy
man
but
also
because
it
seemed
to
show
my
father
had
not
entirely
cast
me
off
but
he
forbade
us
to
go
to
his
house
and
we
went
to
paris
and
lived
there
for
a
year
after
one
year
of
happy
married
life
cecil
died
and
since
then
my
only
aim
in
life
has
been
to
be
reconciled
to
my
father
but
he
will
not
have
it
or
at
least
he
wo
have
it
unless
i
make
the
first
overtures
toward
peace
and
wo
you
cried
patty
in
astonishment
not
i
i
am
not
to
blame
the
two
men
quarrelled
and
now
that
cecil
is
gone
why
should
my
father
hold
the
feud
against
me
it
is
not
my
place
to
ask
his
pardon
i
done
nothing
wrong
you
ran
away
from
home
said
patty
thinking
only
of
the
justice
of
the
case
and
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
seeming
to
censure
a
titled
english
lady
yes
but
that
was
not
wrong
father
knew
that
cecil
was
a
fine
honourable
man
of
an
old
family
he
had
no
right
to
forbid
my
marriage
because
of
a
foolish
personal
disagreement
your
mother
said
patty
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
child
said
lady
hamilton
and
at
once
patty
felt
a
new
bond
of
companionship
i
lived
alone
with
my
father
in
our
great
house
in
london
and
i
had
a
happy
and
uneventful
life
until
cecil
came
since
his
death
i
longed
so
to
go
home
to
my
father
and
be
at
peace
with
him
but
though
many
kind
friends
have
tried
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
they
been
able
to
do
so
and
so
you
live
here
alone
at
the
savoy
yes
with
betham
who
is
really
an
old
dear
though
sometimes
she
grumbles
terribly
and
do
you
go
into
society
i
begun
to
go
a
little
of
late
cecil
made
me
promise
i
never
wear
black
dresses
so
i
worn
white
only
ever
since
he
died
and
i
suppose
i
always
shall
that
is
in
the
house
i
have
black
street
gowns
but
i
ca
seem
to
care
for
gay
parties
as
i
used
to
i
want
father
and
i
want
my
home
is
your
father
in
london
oh
yes
he
a
member
of
parliament
but
he
of
a
stubborn
and
unyielding
nature
and
so
are
you
and
so
am
i
now
let
drop
the
subject
of
myself
for
the
present
while
you
sing
for
me
will
you
yes
indeed
said
patty
warmly
with
more
pleasure
than
i
ever
sang
for
any
one
else
chapter
iv
a
floral
offering
as
the
days
went
by
patty
and
lady
hamilton
became
close
friends
and
fairfield
approved
of
the
intimacy
for
the
elder
influence
was
in
every
way
good
for
patty
and
in
return
the
girl
brought
sunshine
and
happiness
into
lady
hamilton
life
they
went
together
to
concerts
and
picture
exhibitions
but
patty
could
rarely
persuade
her
friend
to
go
to
a
social
affair
it
absurd
lady
hamilton
said
patty
one
day
to
shut
yourself
up
as
you
do
all
london
wants
you
and
yet
you
wo
go
and
play
pretty
with
them
ignoring
this
outburst
lady
hamilton
only
smiled
and
said
do
you
know
patty
i
think
it
time
you
dropped
my
formal
title
and
called
me
by
my
first
name
i
love
to
have
you
do
so
i
often
wondered
what
your
first
name
is
but
i
have
the
slightest
idea
tell
me
no
guess
what
name
do
you
think
suits
me
patty
considered
well
she
said
at
last
i
think
it
must
be
either
ethelfrida
or
gwendolyn
gladys
lady
hamilton
laughed
merrily
prepare
yourself
for
a
sudden
shock
she
said
i
was
named
for
my
grandmother
catharine
catharine
what
an
absurd
name
for
you
you
not
even
a
kate
but
you
are
lady
kitty
and
i
call
you
that
if
i
may
indeed
you
may
father
used
to
call
me
kitty
when
i
was
a
child
but
as
i
grew
older
i
preferred
my
full
name
lady
kitty
is
just
right
for
you
and
when
you
in
the
mood
you
a
saucy
puss
now
listen
the
reason
for
my
invasion
of
your
premises
this
morning
is
that
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
this
afternoon
to
a
tea
on
the
terrace
of
parliament
house
patty
tones
were
very
persuasive
and
she
looked
so
daintily
attractive
in
her
fresh
morning
gown
that
few
could
have
refused
any
request
she
might
make
lady
hamilton
in
a
soft
frilly
white
négligée
was
sipping
her
coffee
and
looking
over
her
letters
when
patty
had
interrupted
the
process
she
looked
at
her
eager
young
guest
with
a
slow
provoking
smile
and
said
only
nixy
but
why
not
said
patty
smiling
too
for
she
knew
the
englishwoman
had
learned
the
slangy
word
from
herself
you
have
a
lovely
time
it
so
beautiful
there
and
the
people
are
always
so
cordial
and
pleasant
but
i
do
want
to
go
but
you
to
want
to
you
too
young
to
give
up
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
world
how
can
i
you
go
you
ca
i
know
it
that
just
the
trouble
with
you
i
never
saw
such
a
stubborn
determined
pigheaded
yes
and
stupidly
obstinate
thing
as
you
are
so
there
now
they
both
laughed
and
then
lady
hamilton
said
more
seriously
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
wo
go
yes
do
if
you
know
yourself
i
know
perfectly
i
wo
go
to
the
terrace
because
i
afraid
i
meet
my
father
there
for
goodness
sake
is
that
the
real
reason
but
you
to
be
reconciled
to
him
yes
but
you
do
understand
we
could
have
a
home
and
all
will
be
forgiven
scene
on
the
terrace
in
sight
of
hundreds
of
people
so
if
i
did
see
him
i
should
have
to
bow
slightly
or
cut
him
dead
it
would
depend
on
his
attitude
toward
me
which
i
did
the
episode
would
merely
serve
to
widen
the
breach
and
it
would
break
me
up
for
days
i
ca
understand
such
conditions
said
patty
earnestly
why
if
i
were
at
odds
with
my
father
and
i
ca
even
imagine
such
a
thing
rush
at
him
and
fling
myself
into
his
arms
and
stay
there
till
everything
was
all
right
that
just
because
you
of
a
different
temperament
and
so
is
your
father
my
father
is
an
austere
unbending
man
and
if
i
were
on
the
terrace
and
were
to
fling
myself
into
his
arms
he
very
likely
fling
me
into
the
thames
you
probably
be
rescued
said
patty
gravely
there
always
so
much
traffic
yes
but
father
would
jump
in
to
rescue
me
so
i
only
spoil
my
gown
for
nothing
give
it
up
dear
it
a
case
outside
your
experience
father
and
i
are
both
too
proud
to
make
the
first
advance
and
yet
i
really
believe
he
wants
me
as
much
as
i
want
him
he
must
be
very
lonely
in
the
great
house
with
only
the
servants
to
look
after
him
perhaps
he
marry
again
said
patty
thoughtfully
my
father
did
i
wish
he
would
but
i
no
hope
of
that
now
never
mind
about
my
troubles
tell
me
of
your
own
who
taking
you
to
the
tea
hastings
but
she
is
giving
it
we
to
sit
at
some
table
i
do
know
whose
the
merediths
will
be
there
too
tom
and
grace
you
know
i
like
them
very
much
yes
they
nice
children
i
know
them
slightly
patty
some
day
give
a
party
for
you
here
in
my
rooms
how
would
you
like
that
oh
lady
kitty
i
love
it
you
have
to
come
to
that
would
you
yes
indeed
you
could
drive
me
away
let
have
a
children
party
all
dress
as
children
i
mean
little
children
or
babies
just
the
thing
i
always
wanted
to
see
a
party
like
that
i
only
heard
of
them
can
we
have
it
soon
next
week
i
think
i
consult
betham
and
i
think
i
can
coax
her
to
it
though
she
bound
to
it
at
first
oh
yes
you
can
coax
her
i
know
how
good
you
are
to
me
i
do
have
beautiful
times
really
too
many
for
one
girl
honestly
lady
kitty
do
you
think
it
right
for
me
to
lead
such
a
butterfly
life
i
just
fly
about
from
one
entertainment
to
another
and
even
if
i
at
home
or
alone
i
always
have
a
good
time
sometimes
i
think
i
a
very
useless
member
of
this
busy
world
lady
hamilton
smiled
kindly
how
old
are
you
she
said
i
be
eighteen
next
month
and
you
have
set
the
thames
on
fire
or
won
the
victoria
cross
yet
but
you
just
at
the
age
when
your
type
of
happy
girlhood
is
often
beset
with
scruples
do
give
way
to
them
patty
it
is
not
your
lot
to
do
definite
physical
good
to
suffering
humanity
like
a
red
cross
nurse
or
the
salvation
army
nor
is
it
necessary
that
you
should
work
to
earn
your
bread
like
a
teacher
or
a
stenographer
but
it
is
your
duty
or
rather
your
privilege
to
shed
sunshine
wherever
you
go
i
think
i
never
known
any
one
with
such
a
talent
for
spontaneous
and
unconscious
of
happiness
it
is
involuntary
which
is
its
chiefest
charm
but
whoever
is
with
you
for
a
time
is
cheered
and
comforted
just
by
the
influence
of
your
own
gladness
this
is
honest
talk
my
child
and
i
want
you
to
take
it
as
i
mean
it
do
to
do
this
thing
that
would
spoil
it
all
but
just
remember
that
you
do
it
and
let
that
satisfy
your
desire
to
be
a
useful
member
of
this
busy
world
you
such
a
dear
said
patty
as
she
caressed
her
friend
hand
affectionately
if
that
all
true
and
of
course
it
is
since
you
say
so
i
very
glad
but
ca
i
do
something
more
definite
more
voluntary
of
course
there
are
always
opportunities
for
doing
good
organised
charities
and
those
things
that
everybody
takes
part
in
but
if
you
want
to
widen
your
own
field
of
benefaction
simply
know
more
people
whether
you
know
them
socially
or
as
casual
acquaintances
you
will
almost
invariably
add
happiness
to
their
lives
though
it
be
in
the
merest
trifles
now
i
assuming
that
you
have
sense
enough
not
to
overdo
this
thing
and
thrust
yourself
upon
people
who
do
want
you
madam
said
patty
in
mock
indignation
you
may
trust
me
i
am
an
american
you
are
indeed
and
you
have
what
is
known
as
yankee
good
sense
if
you
are
a
mere
infant
eighteen
is
pretty
old
think
and
you
not
so
very
ancient
yourself
retorted
patty
but
i
willing
to
sit
at
your
feet
and
acquire
wisdom
when
dressed
to
go
out
that
afternoon
patty
stopped
at
lady
door
to
say
come
in
and
let
me
see
if
you
pass
muster
yes
that
frilly
flowered
muslin
is
just
right
for
the
terrace
and
that
hat
with
long
streamers
is
truly
pastoral
what
pastoral
about
the
terrace
pray
nothing
but
the
ladies
clothes
and
the
demeanour
of
the
i
may
see
your
father
there
you
may
but
he
be
an
exception
to
the
ones
here
let
me
put
these
valley
lilies
in
your
belt
they
rather
suit
your
costume
oh
thank
you
they
beautiful
if
i
see
your
father
i
give
him
a
spray
and
say
you
sent
it
very
well
he
then
pitch
you
and
the
flowers
all
in
the
thames
together
well
at
least
we
cause
a
sensation
among
the
lambs
kitty
lady
little
one
have
a
good
time
and
come
in
to
tell
me
about
it
when
you
return
the
tea
on
the
terrace
was
a
new
delight
patty
had
been
through
the
houses
of
parliament
before
but
this
was
her
first
experience
of
that
unique
function
known
as
the
terrace
tea
the
broad
beautiful
space
was
crowded
with
tables
and
the
tables
were
crowded
with
people
merry
chatting
laughing
londoners
americans
and
foreigners
mingled
in
groups
and
drank
tea
together
hastings
and
patty
were
met
by
their
host
pauncefote
and
escorted
to
a
table
already
surrounded
by
several
people
patty
felt
greatly
pleased
when
she
found
herself
seated
between
grace
and
tom
meredith
and
listened
with
interest
as
they
designated
various
celebrated
people
who
were
strolling
by
but
after
all
she
said
at
last
dukes
and
duchesses
do
look
very
different
from
ordinary
people
of
course
they
do
why
should
they
they
are
any
different
said
tom
indeed
miss
fairfield
i
vanity
enough
to
believe
you
find
me
more
interesting
than
some
of
the
dukes
i
sure
you
are
laughed
patty
but
if
i
were
introduced
to
a
real
duke
i
be
so
scared
i
would
know
what
to
say
now
i
call
that
too
bad
declared
tom
with
an
aggrieved
look
and
pray
why
are
you
scared
when
in
my
august
society
i
am
said
patty
dimpling
as
she
smiled
at
him
only
successfully
striving
not
to
show
my
quaking
fright
that
better
i
hope
the
longer
you
know
me
the
more
awed
you
be
of
my
of
my
of
your
what
calmly
inquired
his
sister
my
word
i
do
know
confessed
tom
of
my
awesomeness
i
suppose
how
do
you
like
london
said
a
loud
voice
in
the
tones
that
are
sometimes
called
stentorian
and
patty
suddenly
realised
that
her
host
was
addressing
her
a
bit
embarrassed
at
finding
the
eyes
of
all
at
the
table
upon
her
she
answered
shyly
i
love
it
it
is
so
so
kind
to
me
bravo
pretty
good
for
an
american
shouted
pauncefote
who
seemed
unable
to
moderate
his
voice
and
which
do
you
like
best
the
people
or
the
the
people
said
patty
her
embarrassment
lost
sight
of
in
a
flash
of
mischief
i
like
the
members
of
parliament
better
than
parliament
house
good
good
cried
the
portly
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
until
the
cups
rattled
that
true
yankee
cleverness
you
a
good
sort
my
child
are
they
all
like
you
in
america
yes
i
think
so
said
patty
demurely
are
they
all
like
you
in
england
patty
innocent
air
of
inquiry
robbed
the
speech
of
all
effect
of
pertness
and
the
genial
pauncefote
roared
with
delight
ha
ha
he
cried
all
like
me
in
england
no
my
child
no
heaven
be
praised
there
are
very
few
after
my
pattern
that
too
bad
said
patty
i
think
your
pattern
is
a
good
one
it
is
said
tom
meredith
if
we
had
more
statesmen
after
pauncefote
pattern
the
house
of
commons
would
be
better
off
this
speech
called
forth
applause
from
the
other
guests
and
the
host
said
loudly
pshaw
pshaw
but
he
looked
greatly
pleased
when
the
tea
was
over
and
the
party
rose
from
the
table
pauncefote
detained
patty
for
a
moment
chat
while
the
others
broke
up
into
smaller
groups
or
wandered
away
i
want
you
to
meet
my
daughter
he
was
saying
the
young
lady
in
gray
over
there
talking
to
sir
otho
sir
otho
who
said
patty
quickly
forgetting
to
respond
in
regard
to
miss
pauncefote
sir
otho
markleham
see
the
large
gentleman
with
glasses
she
is
my
youngest
daughter
and
i
know
she
be
glad
to
meet
you
i
be
delighted
said
patty
but
her
attention
centred
on
sir
otho
could
it
be
that
was
lady
hamilton
severe
father
he
did
not
look
so
obstinate
as
she
had
imagined
him
but
as
she
drew
nearer
she
observed
the
firm
set
of
his
square
jaw
and
reversed
her
opinion
sir
otho
was
very
tall
and
big
and
his
smoothly
brushed
hair
was
light
brown
without
a
trace
of
gray
he
wore
whiskers
of
the
style
known
as
and
his
cold
gray
eyes
almost
glittered
as
he
looked
through
his
glasses
the
introduction
to
miss
pauncefote
implied
also
an
introduction
to
sir
otho
and
in
a
moment
patty
found
herself
chatting
in
a
group
of
which
lady
kitty
father
was
one
there
was
something
about
the
big
man
that
awed
her
and
she
naturally
fell
into
conversation
with
miss
pauncefote
while
the
two
gentlemen
talked
together
but
as
they
were
all
about
to
separate
and
even
after
sir
otho
had
said
patty
hesitated
irresolutely
for
a
second
and
then
turned
back
toward
him
again
sir
otho
she
said
timidly
well
what
is
it
was
the
response
as
he
turned
in
surprise
to
look
at
her
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
said
patty
and
as
soon
as
the
words
were
uttered
she
realised
how
absurd
they
were
thank
you
said
the
puzzled
gentleman
he
was
very
unresponsive
and
showed
in
his
face
that
he
thought
little
of
this
exhibition
of
american
forwardness
especially
so
patty
went
on
because
i
know
your
daughter
lady
hamilton
bless
my
soul
ejaculated
sir
otho
markleham
the
red
blood
dyeing
his
large
face
crimson
and
his
eyes
fairly
snapping
with
anger
yes
i
do
went
on
patty
resolved
now
to
plunge
in
desperately
and
she
sent
you
these
flowers
patty
had
previously
detached
two
or
three
of
the
prettiest
sprays
of
the
lilies
of
the
valley
and
now
held
them
out
with
the
air
of
one
fulfilling
a
trust
for
a
moment
sir
otho
markleham
looked
as
if
he
would
really
like
to
pitch
the
american
girl
and
her
flowers
into
the
river
and
then
almost
mechanically
he
took
the
blossoms
from
patty
hand
then
with
a
straight
cold
stare
at
her
he
said
in
a
hard
voice
i
have
no
daughter
and
after
a
stiff
formal
bow
he
walked
away
chapter
v
miss
yankee
doodle
you
did
really
exclaimed
lady
hamilton
as
patty
gleefully
described
giving
the
flowers
to
sir
otho
markleham
but
i
did
kitty
and
truly
he
mad
enough
to
pitch
me
into
that
yellow
muddy
old
river
i
greatly
admire
his
in
not
really
doing
it
but
what
eyes
he
has
so
gray
and
steely
they
cut
right
through
me
and
he
just
said
tragically
have
no
daughter
and
stalked
away
but
and
this
is
the
main
thing
he
kept
the
flowers
how
do
you
know
i
watched
him
i
fully
expected
he
fling
them
straight
over
parliament
house
but
he
did
he
did
even
throw
them
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
terrace
and
them
his
iron
heel
i
ca
say
that
he
put
them
in
his
for
his
back
was
toward
me
but
i
he
kept
them
oh
patty
you
are
a
silly
you
think
you
gone
far
toward
healing
the
family
feud
of
the
marklehams
but
you
have
my
father
gave
the
whole
episode
no
thought
at
all
unless
it
was
to
think
of
you
as
an
impertinent
child
well
it
was
a
wedge
said
patty
doggedly
and
if
i
ever
get
another
chance
at
him
i
hammer
it
in
no
do
patty
dear
you
mean
well
i
know
but
you
do
know
father
disposition
if
he
thought
you
were
an
intermediary
he
be
more
stubborn
than
ever
huh
said
patty
more
expressively
than
politely
i
not
going
to
make
any
trouble
trust
your
aunt
patty
for
that
lady
hamilton
laughed
as
she
always
did
at
patty
funny
american
phrases
and
the
subject
of
sir
otho
was
dropped
better
not
mix
yourself
up
in
other
people
quarrels
said
fairfield
when
patty
told
him
about
it
your
motive
is
a
good
one
but
an
englishman
is
not
apt
to
brook
interference
from
an
outsider
especially
an
american
oh
pshaw
fred
patty
wo
do
any
harm
said
nan
patty
tact
is
a
match
for
any
english
temper
and
if
she
could
bring
about
a
reconciliation
i
be
so
glad
for
that
sweet
lady
hamilton
all
right
i
give
in
when
you
two
are
against
me
i
hold
up
my
hands
we
not
against
you
daddy
said
patty
smiling
fondly
at
her
father
you
on
our
side
only
you
do
quite
realise
it
i
told
you
she
had
tact
laughed
nan
and
she
grows
cleverer
every
day
do
you
stepdaughter
yes
stepmother
replied
patty
gazing
at
nan
in
mock
adoration
since
i
have
you
for
a
model
how
could
i
do
otherwise
you
a
pair
of
sillies
said
fairfield
laughing
at
their
nonsense
and
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
improve
your
minds
i
think
read
aloud
to
you
oh
goody
cried
patty
for
they
both
loved
to
hear
fairfield
read
and
may
i
ask
lady
kitty
to
come
in
she
sit
still
as
a
mouse
i
know
certainly
my
child
ask
any
one
you
like
if
you
see
any
people
in
the
corridors
bring
them
back
with
you
perhaps
the
elevator
man
will
come
he
wo
be
asked
said
patty
indignantly
i
just
want
my
sweet
lovely
lady
kitty
the
sweet
lovely
lady
was
pleased
to
come
and
did
indeed
sit
still
as
a
mouse
listening
to
fairfield
fine
reading
then
patty
sang
one
or
two
of
her
newest
songs
and
then
nan
declared
they
must
all
go
down
to
the
grill
room
for
a
welsh
rabbit
this
plan
enchanted
patty
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
lady
hamilton
agreed
so
the
evening
proved
a
merry
little
festivity
and
patty
went
to
bed
healthily
tired
but
healthily
happy
bob
hartley
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
ask
patty
to
the
garden
party
at
regent
park
and
patty
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
she
said
to
nan
is
that
the
hartleys
do
seem
to
have
much
money
and
at
a
charity
garden
party
there
are
so
many
ways
to
spend
that
i
fear
i
be
a
burden
to
them
it
makes
me
awfully
uncomfortable
and
yet
i
ca
offer
to
pay
for
myself
and
with
those
young
men
present
i
ca
offer
to
pay
for
the
whole
party
no
agreed
nan
but
you
might
do
something
yourself
invite
them
all
to
be
your
guests
at
some
especial
or
booth
there
are
often
such
opportunities
i
hope
there
will
be
the
hartleys
are
a
funny
kind
of
poor
they
have
a
good
apartment
in
london
and
their
country
place
is
fine
they
have
old
servants
and
keep
a
carriage
and
all
that
and
yet
they
never
seem
to
have
spending
money
english
people
are
often
like
that
the
keeping
up
of
an
establishment
comes
first
with
them
and
little
personal
comforts
afterward
that
is
my
idea
of
economy
said
patty
decidedly
i
rather
spend
all
i
want
on
flowers
and
books
and
pretty
hats
and
go
without
a
butler
and
a
footman
and
even
a
team
of
horses
you
ca
judge
because
you
always
had
whatever
you
want
of
course
because
father
is
indulgent
and
has
plenty
of
money
but
if
he
had
i
be
just
as
happy
living
in
a
plainer
way
yes
patty
i
believe
you
would
and
nan
looked
at
the
girl
affectionately
well
do
your
best
to
help
the
hartleys
financially
this
afternoon
without
offending
them
ah
that
just
the
trouble
they
so
dreadfully
proud
they
accept
so
much
as
a
glass
of
lemonade
from
one
who
is
their
guest
try
it
and
see
it
may
not
be
so
difficult
as
you
think
so
patty
went
gaily
off
to
the
garden
party
hartley
called
for
her
in
her
carriage
mabel
was
with
her
and
they
were
to
meet
the
boys
at
the
park
it
was
a
beautiful
drive
in
the
open
victoria
along
the
busy
streets
of
the
city
and
then
on
out
to
the
green
slopes
of
regent
park
the
portion
of
the
park
devoted
to
the
garden
party
was
gay
with
booths
and
tents
and
arbours
and
shows
of
all
sorts
sinclair
and
robert
were
awaiting
them
and
also
another
young
englishman
whom
bob
introduced
as
lawton
the
latter
was
a
typical
briton
with
a
slight
drawl
and
a
monocle
in
his
right
eye
awfully
jolly
to
meet
you
he
exclaimed
as
he
shook
hand
and
bowed
formally
to
the
girls
he
fascinated
patty
he
was
so
exactly
like
the
young
englishmen
pictured
in
and
she
waited
to
hear
him
say
bah
jove
but
he
did
say
it
he
contented
himself
with
my
word
by
way
of
expletive
and
though
it
did
seem
to
mean
anything
it
was
apparently
useful
to
him
you
must
jolly
well
let
me
be
your
guide
he
declared
hartley
and
i
will
lead
and
the
rest
of
you
will
follow
wherever
we
go
first
we
make
the
grand
tour
this
meant
joining
a
long
procession
that
were
sauntering
along
a
board
walk
on
either
side
of
which
were
settees
filled
with
people
patty
with
sinclair
followed
the
leaders
and
mabel
and
bob
followed
them
but
their
progress
was
slow
for
continually
some
of
the
party
recognised
friends
seated
alongside
and
stopped
to
speak
to
them
patty
was
introduced
so
often
that
she
became
bewildered
and
soon
stopped
trying
to
remember
who
was
who
you
getting
jolly
well
fagged
said
lawton
suddenly
noticing
her
expression
now
we
stop
this
and
adjourn
to
the
tea
tent
this
they
did
and
were
soon
comfortably
seated
round
a
tea
table
great
show
is
it
said
bob
enthusiastically
and
you
have
seen
half
of
it
yet
there
and
punch
and
judy
and
the
contest
and
i
do
know
what
beside
sinclair
adroitly
paid
the
tea
bill
before
lawton
could
do
so
though
the
latter
tried
never
mind
old
fellow
he
cried
i
get
even
with
you
i
hereby
invite
you
all
to
supper
at
six
we
pleased
to
accept
said
patty
promptly
and
i
hereby
invite
you
all
to
the
play
or
whatever
it
is
given
by
the
stagefright
club
i
think
that
such
a
lovely
name
for
a
dramatic
club
ca
we
go
at
once
hartley
looked
a
little
disturbed
at
patty
invitation
but
did
not
demur
and
tea
being
over
they
all
went
toward
the
tent
where
the
play
was
to
be
given
patty
managed
to
walk
ahead
with
lawton
this
time
and
when
they
reached
the
big
tent
she
offered
him
her
little
gold
saying
quietly
wo
you
see
to
the
tickets
please
trust
me
said
lawton
and
taking
patty
purse
he
bought
seats
for
them
all
it
was
gracefully
done
and
they
all
went
in
in
gay
spirits
and
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
thanks
to
patty
tact
the
play
was
very
funny
though
only
a
trifling
farce
it
was
written
by
professionals
for
the
benefit
of
the
charity
and
was
played
by
the
clever
amateurs
who
had
chosen
such
an
odd
name
for
their
club
the
situations
in
the
play
were
screamingly
funny
and
patty
shook
with
laughter
as
she
listened
to
the
jokes
and
the
merry
hist
she
comes
declared
a
weird
figure
in
a
sepulchral
voice
as
he
waited
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
hist
she
comes
but
nobody
came
that
her
cue
he
muttered
what
can
be
the
matter
i
say
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
louder
hist
she
comes
as
the
expected
entrance
was
still
delayed
he
only
said
well
she
ought
to
be
hissed
when
she
does
come
and
calmly
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
amid
the
applause
of
the
audience
the
short
playlet
soon
came
to
an
end
and
still
shaking
with
laughter
the
party
went
out
again
into
the
beautiful
atmosphere
which
is
found
on
a
spring
day
in
regent
park
now
my
children
said
hartley
i
simply
can
not
walk
about
any
more
i
going
to
sit
in
one
of
those
chairs
yonder
for
i
see
some
people
i
know
over
there
you
can
amuse
yourselves
with
punch
and
judy
or
ring
toss
or
whatever
you
like
and
come
back
to
me
in
an
hour
or
so
sinclair
look
after
the
little
ones
wo
you
it
was
a
great
joke
that
sinclair
the
oldest
hartley
boy
should
look
after
the
others
he
had
reached
the
age
of
twenty
and
was
much
more
grave
and
dignified
than
bob
and
grace
hartley
often
declared
she
could
even
trust
him
to
match
samples
for
her
so
careful
was
he
so
the
young
people
wandered
away
and
spent
a
delightful
hour
looking
at
the
beautiful
or
grotesque
sights
that
adorned
the
fair
patty
could
not
do
much
financially
but
under
cover
of
giving
to
charity
she
bought
pretty
souvenirs
for
mabel
and
hartley
and
laughingly
invited
the
group
to
be
photographed
by
a
camera
fiend
this
personage
was
clothed
in
red
and
with
black
horns
and
mephistophelean
countenance
was
made
to
look
as
much
like
a
fiend
as
possible
with
outlandish
hoots
and
yells
he
posed
the
group
and
took
several
snapshots
which
they
were
to
call
for
later
as
they
concluded
it
was
nearly
time
to
drift
back
to
hartley
patty
noticed
a
gentleman
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
looking
at
her
intently
who
your
friend
patty
asked
mabel
do
you
know
him
yes
said
patty
slowly
he
sir
otho
markleham
so
he
is
said
bob
i
seen
him
often
but
i
do
know
him
personally
sir
otho
still
looking
at
patty
took
a
few
steps
toward
her
and
then
paused
irresolutely
please
excuse
me
said
patty
to
the
others
i
think
i
go
speak
to
him
for
a
minute
do
said
lawton
we
wait
for
you
right
here
following
an
impulse
patty
walked
directly
toward
sir
otho
who
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
run
away
how
do
you
do
she
said
pleasantly
as
they
met
quite
well
he
said
but
there
was
no
responsiveness
in
his
manner
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
now
after
he
had
first
advanced
toward
patty
this
was
a
strange
question
but
she
bravely
took
up
the
burden
of
conversation
well
yes
she
said
smiling
at
him
prettily
i
want
to
ask
you
how
you
are
enjoying
the
garden
party
i
never
enjoy
anything
he
returned
but
his
face
was
sad
now
rather
than
angry
oh
what
a
pity
said
patty
involuntarily
and
you
have
such
powers
of
enjoyment
too
how
do
you
know
that
miss
yankee
doodle
patty
did
altogether
like
the
name
or
rather
the
tone
in
which
it
was
said
but
she
was
determined
not
to
get
piqued
so
she
said
oh
because
you
such
a
big
healthy
man
you
ought
to
laugh
most
of
the
time
ought
i
indeed
but
you
see
i
never
have
anything
to
laugh
at
at
this
patty
laughed
outright
why
the
world
is
full
of
things
to
laugh
at
and
you
not
blind
no
but
i
do
feel
like
laughing
do
you
ever
even
feel
like
smiling
not
often
did
you
feel
like
smiling
just
a
little
bit
of
a
happy
smile
when
i
gave
you
those
flowers
the
other
day
those
flowers
from
kitty
sir
otho
face
grew
dark
how
dare
you
mention
her
name
to
me
he
cried
you
are
a
saucy
minx
go
away
i
wo
be
sent
away
like
that
declared
patty
looking
haughty
now
i
no
child
to
be
scolded
for
nothing
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
that
what
do
you
think
i
am
sir
otho
turned
red
with
rage
he
choked
and
stammered
and
looked
like
a
choleric
old
gentleman
as
indeed
he
was
i
think
you
an
impertinent
yankee
what
do
you
think
i
am
patty
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eye
her
chance
had
come
and
she
did
not
flinch
i
think
she
said
looking
steadfastly
at
him
i
think
you
an
obstinate
stubborn
selfish
cruel
old
pighead
she
confessed
afterward
that
at
that
moment
she
fully
expected
the
irate
old
man
to
strike
her
but
he
did
not
instead
he
looked
at
her
just
a
moment
in
amazement
and
then
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
surprised
beyond
measure
but
unable
to
resist
the
infectious
merriment
patty
laughed
too
oh
miss
yankee
doodle
said
sir
otho
wiping
his
eyes
you
are
most
astonishing
the
strange
part
is
you
are
quite
right
i
a
stubborn
old
pighead
but
how
did
you
know
it
do
i
wear
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
to
that
extent
have
you
a
heart
asked
patty
so
gravely
that
sir
otho
again
roared
with
laughter
and
yet
said
patty
thoughtfully
seeing
that
frankness
pleased
the
old
man
and
yet
no
one
with
such
a
sense
of
humour
as
you
seem
to
have
can
be
wholly
bad
oh
thank
you
so
i
not
wholly
bad
well
that
a
comfort
i
always
thought
i
was
but
your
friends
are
looking
this
way
i
think
they
want
you
to
rejoin
them
in
a
moment
said
patty
sir
otho
wo
you
please
send
a
flower
back
to
my
friend
lady
hamilton
i
would
do
much
for
any
friend
of
yours
said
the
strange
old
man
very
gravely
and
taking
a
few
steps
to
a
nearby
flower
stand
he
bought
a
bunch
of
sweet
peas
and
said
carelessly
give
her
those
if
you
like
then
formally
escorting
patty
back
to
her
friends
he
raised
his
hat
and
walked
quickly
away
chapter
vi
herenden
hall
there
kitty
lady
said
patty
as
she
reached
the
savoy
on
her
return
from
the
garden
party
there
a
nosegay
from
your
affectionate
father
lady
hamilton
stared
at
the
bunch
of
sweet
peas
that
patty
held
out
to
her
my
word
she
exclaimed
you
are
the
most
amazing
child
i
suppose
he
sent
them
to
me
just
about
as
much
as
i
sent
him
those
valley
lilies
you
took
to
him
the
other
day
lady
kitty
guessed
so
near
the
truth
that
patty
felt
a
little
crestfallen
it
was
more
than
that
she
said
i
asked
him
to
send
some
flowers
to
you
and
he
bought
these
purposely
did
he
select
sweet
peas
himself
yes
that
means
something
then
patty
dear
for
father
well
knows
my
fondness
for
these
flowers
well
you
a
dear
good
little
girl
to
try
to
heal
the
breach
but
i
ca
feel
much
encouragement
father
is
too
old
and
too
obstinate
ever
to
forgive
me
and
you
too
young
and
too
obstinate
to
go
and
beg
his
forgiveness
indeed
i
am
fancy
my
meekly
returning
like
a
prodigal
daughter
when
i
have
done
anything
wrong
you
do
deserve
a
reconciliation
cried
patty
you
a
little
thing
for
all
you
look
so
soft
and
amiable
yes
said
lady
kitty
demurely
i
inherited
my
father
disposition
indeed
you
did
and
you
grow
more
like
him
every
day
you
live
if
you
do
try
to
be
more
forgiving
i
believe
you
right
patty
and
perhaps
some
day
i
will
try
but
now
let
me
tell
you
what
been
happening
while
you
were
away
i
had
a
call
from
that
very
charming
stepmother
of
yours
and
this
was
the
burden
of
her
visit
it
seems
that
she
and
your
father
are
invited
to
spend
the
at
a
country
house
and
the
question
was
where
to
pack
you
away
for
while
they
gone
and
they
going
to
let
me
stay
with
you
exclaimed
patty
clasping
her
hands
and
assuming
an
ecstatically
happy
expression
well
nan
seemed
to
think
that
i
could
keep
you
in
order
though
i
not
so
sure
of
it
myself
but
the
strange
part
is
i
also
am
invited
for
this
same
to
a
most
delightful
country
house
and
i
have
already
accepted
patty
face
fell
what
is
to
become
of
poor
little
me
she
said
i
do
want
to
stay
with
mrs
betham
no
i
a
plan
for
you
and
it
this
i
want
to
take
you
with
me
to
herenden
hall
where
i
going
and
nan
says
i
may
oh
kitty
you
duck
how
perfectly
lovely
patty
flew
at
her
friend
and
nearly
strangled
her
in
a
spasmodic
embrace
you
see
went
on
lady
hamilton
when
she
had
regained
her
breath
so
well
acquainted
with
the
herendens
that
i
can
ask
an
invitation
for
you
and
though
you
not
really
yet
it
will
give
you
a
glimpse
of
the
nicest
kind
of
english
life
it
great
declared
patty
i
wild
with
excitement
but
i
care
more
about
being
with
you
than
i
do
about
the
you
wo
when
you
get
there
they
really
charming
people
and
the
hall
is
one
of
the
finest
old
estates
in
england
shall
i
have
to
have
some
new
frocks
we
look
over
your
wardrobe
and
see
i
fancy
the
ones
you
already
have
will
do
you
know
you
be
looked
upon
as
scarcely
more
than
a
schoolgirl
and
you
must
wear
simple
frilly
muslins
and
hats
i
can
even
live
through
that
i
do
care
what
i
wear
if
i
with
you
three
whole
days
will
it
be
three
days
kitty
three
days
or
more
if
they
politely
ask
us
to
remain
a
day
or
two
longer
we
might
do
so
they
old
friends
of
mine
do
you
see
and
i
have
been
there
for
years
so
they
be
glad
to
see
us
to
see
you
you
mean
they
do
know
me
so
how
can
they
be
glad
to
see
me
oh
you
must
what
is
your
idiotic
american
phrase
you
must
good
i
will
said
patty
laughing
to
hear
the
phrase
from
an
englishwoman
and
then
she
ran
away
to
her
own
apartment
to
talk
over
affairs
with
nan
it
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
said
nan
that
you
such
good
friends
with
lady
hamilton
for
fred
and
i
could
take
you
with
us
and
what
would
have
become
of
you
oh
i
always
land
on
my
feet
returned
patty
i
must
have
been
born
under
a
lucky
star
i
believe
you
were
pattykins
and
wo
i
have
the
time
of
my
life
at
herenden
hall
oh
patty
patty
you
must
stop
using
slang
they
never
ask
you
to
herenden
hall
again
if
you
behave
like
a
wild
indian
but
you
see
stepmother
they
look
upon
me
as
an
infant
anyhow
so
i
may
as
well
have
some
fun
but
do
be
a
hoyden
and
do
remember
that
american
slang
is
admired
over
here
yas
i
be
good
and
i
say
and
fancy
till
they
think
i
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
i
not
at
all
worried
about
your
manners
said
nan
serenely
you
usually
behave
pretty
well
but
you
will
talk
american
instead
of
english
well
i
try
to
make
myself
understood
at
all
events
and
going
to
have
a
lovely
time
too
are
you
is
it
fun
i
do
like
to
have
all
my
friends
as
happy
as
i
am
i
suppose
you
and
father
will
be
like
two
young
off
on
your
honeymoon
trip
oh
we
always
that
even
when
there
a
great
big
girl
like
you
around
to
make
us
seem
old
well
if
you
behave
as
well
as
you
look
i
wo
be
ashamed
of
you
patty
gazed
critically
at
nan
and
then
added
though
your
nose
does
seem
to
turn
up
more
than
it
used
to
whereupon
nan
threw
a
at
her
which
patty
caught
and
stuffed
behind
her
own
curly
head
the
saturday
of
their
departure
was
a
beautiful
bright
day
and
it
was
about
noon
when
patty
and
lady
hamilton
accompanied
by
the
maid
took
the
train
from
victoria
station
it
was
a
long
ride
to
their
destination
in
kent
and
not
an
especially
interesting
one
but
patty
in
the
companionship
of
her
dear
friend
was
entirely
happy
they
chatted
gaily
as
the
train
rolled
from
one
english
town
to
another
at
robertsbridge
they
had
to
change
to
a
funny
little
railroad
which
had
the
strangest
cars
patty
had
ever
seen
they
were
almost
like
freight
cars
with
benches
along
the
sides
there
were
no
tickets
and
presently
the
guard
came
in
to
collect
their
fares
as
if
in
a
moreover
the
luggage
had
been
tumbled
in
without
check
or
paster
and
patty
wondered
if
anybody
ever
could
pick
out
their
own
again
your
regular
coaches
are
funny
enough
she
said
to
lady
hamilton
but
they
are
comfortable
this
box
we
in
is
like
a
cattle
pen
oh
no
laughed
lady
hamilton
this
is
bad
at
all
you
see
only
a
tiny
branch
road
running
to
some
little
hamlets
and
it
not
much
used
there
are
only
about
two
trains
each
way
every
day
this
gave
patty
a
different
idea
of
the
little
railroad
and
she
began
to
feel
a
more
personal
interest
in
it
they
rolled
slowly
through
the
country
and
though
the
scenery
was
not
grand
it
was
picturesque
patty
said
it
was
like
a
panorama
of
the
angelus
they
reached
their
station
at
about
five
and
found
a
fine
open
barouche
awaiting
them
and
a
wagon
for
their
trunks
the
footman
greeted
them
deferentially
and
asked
them
to
pick
out
their
luggage
from
the
lot
that
had
been
dumped
on
the
station
platform
i
ca
see
either
of
my
trunks
said
patty
so
i
suppose
i
better
take
the
ones
i
like
best
of
these
others
nonsense
said
lady
hamilton
yours
must
be
here
somewhere
look
around
marie
you
know
miss
fairfield
boxes
yes
my
lady
but
they
are
not
here
sure
enough
they
were
there
and
as
patty
was
certain
they
had
been
put
on
the
train
she
concluded
they
had
been
carried
on
what
can
i
do
she
cried
can
we
telephone
to
the
next
station
and
have
them
sent
back
but
in
that
small
station
merely
a
tiny
box
there
was
no
telephone
the
impassive
coachman
and
footman
from
herenden
hall
seemed
to
have
no
advice
to
offer
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
proceed
to
the
house
patty
was
distressed
at
the
outlook
oh
kitty
she
said
i
ca
go
to
dinner
at
all
of
course
i
appear
in
this
travelling
costume
and
i
have
to
put
on
one
of
your
négligées
and
eat
dinner
all
alone
in
my
room
the
prospect
was
appalling
but
neither
of
them
could
think
of
any
help
for
it
has
lady
herenden
any
daughters
about
my
age
patty
asked
after
a
few
moments
thought
no
indeed
she
and
lord
herenden
have
no
children
but
if
there
are
any
young
girls
there
as
guests
you
might
borrow
a
frock
for
surely
they
get
your
things
by
they
drove
into
the
park
through
great
gates
and
past
various
lodges
the
wonderful
old
trees
waved
above
their
heads
the
marvellous
lawns
stretched
away
in
rolling
slopes
and
the
road
wound
along
now
over
a
bridge
now
under
an
arch
until
they
paused
at
the
noble
old
entrance
of
herenden
hall
liveried
servants
seemed
to
appear
as
if
by
magic
from
all
directions
at
once
dogs
came
barking
a
noisy
welcome
and
following
lady
hamilton
across
the
terrace
and
into
the
great
entrance
hall
patty
found
herself
being
presented
to
a
lovely
young
woman
almost
as
beautiful
as
lady
hamilton
herself
you
must
be
the
greatest
chums
lady
hamilton
was
saying
for
miss
fairfield
is
one
of
my
dearest
friends
and
i
want
you
to
adore
each
other
we
will
said
lady
herenden
and
patty
at
the
same
moment
and
then
they
all
laughed
and
the
guests
were
at
once
shown
to
their
rooms
after
a
bewildering
route
through
several
branching
halls
patty
found
that
to
her
had
been
assigned
a
large
and
pleasant
room
which
looked
out
upon
the
on
one
side
it
communicated
with
lady
room
and
on
the
other
opened
into
a
dainty
and
bath
it
was
all
enchanting
and
patty
gaze
rested
admiringly
upon
the
chintz
draperies
and
dresden
ornaments
when
she
heard
a
tap
at
her
door
answering
she
found
a
trim
maid
who
courtesied
and
said
i
susan
miss
will
you
give
me
the
keys
of
your
boxes
and
i
unpack
them
patty
almost
laughed
at
this
casual
request
in
the
face
of
what
seemed
to
her
a
tragedy
susan
she
said
here
are
the
keys
but
you
ca
unpack
my
boxes
for
they
have
come
lor
miss
they
must
be
downstairs
i
have
them
sent
up
no
wait
susan
they
not
downstairs
they
did
come
on
the
train
lor
miss
whatever
will
you
do
the
girl
eyes
grew
big
and
troubled
here
was
a
dreadful
situation
indeed
already
susan
felt
drawn
toward
the
pretty
young
american
girl
and
she
was
aghast
at
the
outlook
of
a
dinner
party
with
no
party
frock
i
ca
go
to
dinner
at
all
susan
said
patty
dejectedly
you
must
bring
me
a
tray
up
here
though
i
do
feel
like
eating
not
go
to
dinner
miss
oh
what
a
pity
it
a
grand
dinner
the
earl
of
ruthven
is
here
and
it
one
of
her
ladyship
greatest
dinners
of
the
season
the
good
susan
looked
so
concerned
and
her
face
was
so
anxious
that
it
went
straight
to
patty
heart
to
her
mind
there
came
a
vivid
and
tantalising
remembrance
of
her
exquisite
dinner
frock
of
white
chiffon
embroidered
with
tiny
sprays
of
blossoms
a
soft
sash
and
one
of
the
loveliest
dresses
she
had
ever
had
and
with
a
sob
she
threw
herself
on
to
the
couch
and
indulged
in
a
few
foolish
but
comforting
tears
there
there
miss
said
susan
sympathisingly
do
ee
take
on
so
maybe
we
can
find
summat
for
ee
when
susan
was
excited
or
troubled
she
lapsed
into
her
old
dialect
which
she
was
striving
to
outgrow
you
ca
find
anything
i
know
said
patty
sitting
up
and
looking
the
picture
of
woe
there
are
no
very
young
ladies
in
the
house
are
there
susan
no
miss
none
so
young
as
yourself
nor
near
it
and
i
ca
wear
this
went
on
patty
looking
at
the
silk
blouse
that
was
part
of
her
travelling
gown
lor
no
miss
not
to
a
dinner
then
what
then
what
indeed
miss
patty
and
susan
faced
each
other
at
last
in
a
full
realisation
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
when
after
a
light
tap
at
the
door
lady
hamilton
came
in
she
laughed
outright
at
the
tragic
attitude
of
the
two
and
knew
at
once
what
they
were
troubled
about
listen
to
me
pattypet
she
said
am
i
your
fairy
godmother
or
am
i
not
you
are
said
patty
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
feeling
sure
that
lady
hamilton
was
about
to
help
her
out
of
her
troubles
somehow
well
i
carefully
considered
the
case
i
sent
marie
to
canvass
the
house
for
clothes
suitable
for
a
mademoiselle
of
seventeen
nearly
eighteen
murmured
patty
it
does
matter
there
is
what
known
as
a
beneath
this
roof
now
i
simply
refuse
to
let
you
be
absent
from
this
dinner
it
will
be
both
a
pleasure
and
an
education
to
you
to
see
this
especial
kind
of
a
formal
function
and
probably
you
not
often
have
a
chance
they
sent
a
man
and
a
wagon
over
to
the
next
station
several
miles
away
for
your
boxes
that
the
way
they
do
things
here
but
he
ca
get
back
until
long
after
the
dinner
hour
so
listen
to
my
command
dictum
fiat
call
it
what
you
please
but
this
is
what
to
do
i
do
anything
you
say
kitty
lady
if
it
to
go
to
bed
at
once
and
sleep
soundly
till
morning
nothing
of
the
sort
you
must
and
shall
attend
this
dinner
and
going
to
wear
one
of
my
gowns
yours
yes
we
so
nearly
the
same
size
that
it
will
fit
you
quite
well
enough
i
picked
out
the
simplest
one
a
white
irish
point
it
cut
princess
but
all
my
gowns
are
i
sure
marie
can
make
it
fit
you
perfectly
with
a
few
pins
or
a
stitch
here
and
there
oh
it
will
fit
well
enough
but
kitty
wo
i
be
the
never
worn
a
real
train
in
my
life
of
course
it
a
lot
too
old
for
you
and
truly
i
hate
to
have
you
appear
in
a
gown
like
that
but
what
else
can
we
do
i
wo
let
you
miss
the
dinner
and
after
all
it
does
matter
so
much
after
this
visit
i
doubt
if
you
ever
see
these
people
again
and
let
them
think
five
or
six
years
older
than
you
are
who
cares
i
do
said
patty
gleefully
i
think
it
will
be
fun
i
have
my
hair
piled
high
on
my
head
can
you
do
it
for
me
sarah
oh
yes
miss
i
a
and
i
that
glad
you
going
to
dinner
chapter
vii
for
one
night
only
sarah
was
indeed
an
expert
and
she
piled
up
patty
hair
in
soft
coils
and
twisted
the
curly
tendrils
into
fluffy
puffs
and
though
the
result
was
beautiful
it
made
patty
look
like
her
own
older
sister
a
jewelled
ornament
of
lady
hamilton
crowned
the
coiffure
and
this
gave
an
added
effect
of
dignity
the
lace
gown
was
easily
made
to
fit
its
new
wearer
marie
pinned
it
and
sewed
it
and
patted
it
into
place
till
nobody
would
suspect
it
had
not
been
made
for
patty
but
the
long
lines
of
the
princess
pattern
took
away
all
of
patty
usual
simple
girlish
appearance
and
transformed
her
at
once
into
a
beautiful
queenly
young
woman
the
décolletée
corsage
and
the
sleeves
which
were
merely
frills
of
lace
were
very
becoming
and
the
long
train
which
billowed
into
a
of
chiffon
ruffles
took
away
the
last
semblance
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
notwithstanding
her
cheeks
and
throat
and
her
exquisite
fresh
complexion
patty
looked
quite
the
young
woman
of
society
and
could
easily
have
been
adjudged
about
years
old
her
eyes
danced
as
she
walked
sedately
through
the
open
door
and
into
lady
hamilton
room
my
word
patty
exclaimed
that
lady
you
simply
stunning
in
that
gown
you
look
as
if
you
been
for
two
or
three
seasons
your
people
would
never
forgive
me
if
they
knew
how
i
dressed
you
up
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
said
patty
airily
as
she
began
to
draw
on
her
arms
a
pair
of
lady
hamilton
long
white
gloves
the
wonder
is
that
you
had
plenty
of
all
sorts
of
things
to
fit
me
out
and
also
that
they
do
fit
so
well
these
gloves
are
just
right
though
i
confess
the
slippers
pinch
me
just
a
speck
never
hurts
you
know
said
lady
hamilton
laughing
marie
is
miss
fairfield
a
picture
oui
she
is
it
is
amazing
how
the
gown
suits
her
she
is
with
the
clothes
patty
had
quite
unconsciously
assumed
a
air
she
nonchalantly
flung
aside
her
train
with
just
the
same
gesture
lady
hamilton
was
wont
to
use
and
she
carried
herself
with
a
dignity
and
graciousness
of
manner
which
would
have
been
absurd
when
wearing
her
own
simple
frocks
illustration
marie
pinned
it
and
sewed
it
gracious
goodness
child
cried
lady
hamilton
come
down
off
that
pedestal
you
walk
like
a
duchess
it
wo
do
you
know
really
i
do
mean
to
said
patty
you
know
i
a
sort
of
chameleon
this
gown
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
belonged
in
an
or
had
an
audience
with
the
queen
oh
you
goose
stop
your
nonsense
and
we
go
down
to
dinner
mind
now
none
of
those
airs
or
i
send
you
back
to
your
room
patty
honestly
tried
to
be
her
own
self
and
would
have
succeeded
all
right
if
herenden
hall
had
not
been
so
lavishly
provided
with
mirrors
on
the
grand
staircase
she
came
face
to
face
with
a
radiant
creature
and
was
about
to
step
aside
when
she
discovered
it
was
herself
involuntarily
she
gazed
at
the
reflection
of
the
lady
and
unconsciously
an
air
of
serenity
almost
hauteur
replaced
her
usual
merry
smile
and
with
a
gracious
mien
she
passed
on
down
the
stairs
lady
herenden
awaited
them
in
the
a
brilliant
assemblage
was
already
there
for
patty
unusual
costuming
had
caused
her
some
delay
after
the
first
few
introductions
lady
hamilton
and
patty
became
separated
and
the
guests
stood
about
conversing
in
small
groups
patty
chanced
to
fall
in
with
some
very
entertaining
people
among
whom
was
the
earl
of
ruthven
the
earl
was
a
handsome
man
tall
and
of
an
imposing
presence
when
presented
to
patty
he
gazed
at
her
with
frank
though
quite
deferential
admiration
so
pleased
to
meet
you
miss
fairfield
he
said
i
adore
american
ladies
patty
really
felt
a
little
in
awe
of
an
earl
as
she
had
never
met
one
before
and
was
about
to
make
a
shy
response
when
a
slight
movement
of
her
head
showed
her
her
own
reflection
in
a
nearby
mirror
realising
afresh
that
she
was
masquerading
as
a
society
lady
a
spirit
of
mischief
suddenly
took
possession
of
her
and
she
determined
to
throw
herself
into
the
rôle
so
with
a
pretty
little
toss
of
her
head
and
a
charming
smile
she
said
thank
you
lord
ruthven
i
adore
englishmen
too
but
i
know
so
few
of
them
you
not
been
here
long
then
no
only
a
few
weeks
and
there
so
much
i
want
to
learn
let
me
teach
you
said
his
lordship
eagerly
i
do
not
think
you
would
prove
a
dull
pupil
patty
eyes
smiled
no
americans
are
dull
she
said
that
true
my
experience
has
already
proved
it
i
met
six
i
think
including
yourself
but
what
sort
of
things
do
you
want
to
learn
the
language
principally
i
just
want
to
learn
to
say
occasionally
and
see
in
the
middle
of
every
sentence
it
not
easy
said
lord
ruthven
thoughtfully
but
i
think
i
can
teach
you
in
say
about
ten
lessons
when
shall
we
begin
the
course
patty
looked
at
him
reproachfully
if
you
knew
the
american
nature
at
all
she
said
you
know
that
we
always
begin
things
the
moment
the
plan
occurs
to
us
good
there
no
time
like
the
present
but
just
then
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
announcement
of
dinner
patty
hoped
she
would
sit
at
table
next
the
earl
but
it
was
not
so
the
nobleman
was
accorded
the
seat
of
honour
at
the
right
of
his
hostess
while
patty
as
a
minor
guest
was
far
away
across
the
table
but
she
found
herself
between
two
affable
and
young
englishmen
and
instantly
forgot
all
about
her
titled
friend
indeed
the
bewildering
beauty
of
the
scene
claimed
her
attention
and
she
fairly
held
her
breath
as
she
looked
about
her
the
great
oval
room
was
lighted
only
by
wax
candles
in
crystal
chandeliers
and
candelabra
this
made
a
soft
mellow
radiance
quite
different
from
gas
or
electricity
on
one
side
of
the
room
long
french
windows
opened
on
to
the
terrace
through
which
came
the
scent
of
roses
and
the
sound
of
plashing
fountains
on
the
other
side
only
slender
pillars
and
arches
divided
the
from
a
conservatory
and
a
riotous
tangle
of
blossoms
and
foliage
fairly
spilled
into
the
room
forming
almost
a
cascade
of
flowers
the
great
round
table
was
a
bewildering
array
of
gold
plate
gilded
glass
and
exquisite
china
while
on
the
delicate
lace
of
the
tablecloth
lay
rare
blossoms
that
seemed
to
have
drifted
from
the
circular
mound
of
flowers
which
formed
the
low
centrepiece
guests
sat
round
the
board
in
chairs
of
gilded
wicker
and
as
the
silent
waiters
served
the
viands
the
scene
became
as
animated
as
it
was
beautiful
patty
forgot
all
else
in
her
absolute
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
and
was
only
brought
back
to
a
sense
of
reality
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
at
her
side
merivale
was
speaking
the
young
man
who
had
escorted
her
out
to
dinner
and
who
now
sat
at
her
right
hand
you
love
beauty
of
detail
he
was
saying
as
he
noted
absorption
oh
is
it
great
she
exclaimed
and
then
suddenly
realised
that
the
expression
was
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
dignity
of
her
princess
gown
but
merivale
seemed
amused
rather
than
shocked
that
american
for
is
it
he
said
smiling
but
whatever
the
adjective
the
fact
is
the
same
lady
herenden
dinners
are
always
the
refinement
of
the
spectacular
patty
realised
the
appropriateness
of
this
phrase
and
cudgelled
her
brain
for
an
appropriate
reply
she
began
to
think
that
playing
was
a
more
difficult
game
than
she
had
supposed
had
she
had
on
her
own
simple
little
frock
merivale
would
not
have
talked
to
her
like
that
do
you
remember
last
season
he
went
on
when
lady
herenden
had
a
real
pond
with
gold
fish
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
ferns
and
water
lilies
round
the
edge
i
was
here
last
season
said
patty
i
have
never
been
in
england
until
this
summer
indeed
i
know
you
are
an
american
but
you
have
really
an
english
manner
it
acquired
said
patty
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eye
i
find
my
american
manner
is
admired
over
here
so
i
assume
london
airs
ah
you
wish
to
be
admired
of
all
things
declared
naughty
patty
with
a
roguish
glance
at
the
jesting
young
man
you
probably
get
your
wish
he
replied
i
jolly
well
ready
to
do
my
share
this
brought
the
colour
to
patty
cheeks
and
she
turned
slightly
away
toward
the
man
on
her
other
side
he
was
a
slightly
older
man
than
merivale
and
was
the
squire
of
an
adjoining
estate
he
was
quite
ready
to
talk
to
his
american
neighbour
and
began
the
conversation
by
asking
her
if
she
had
yet
seen
lady
herenden
no
snowden
said
patty
i
only
arrived
a
few
hours
ago
and
not
been
round
the
place
at
all
then
let
me
show
it
to
you
please
i
come
over
morning
for
a
stroll
may
i
i
do
know
said
patty
hesitatingly
for
she
was
uncertain
what
she
ought
to
do
in
the
matter
you
see
i
with
lady
hamilton
and
whatever
she
says
oh
nonsense
she
spare
you
from
her
side
for
an
hour
or
two
really
a
lot
to
see
again
poor
patty
realised
her
anomalous
position
but
for
her
hair
and
her
trained
gown
the
man
would
never
have
dreamed
of
asking
her
to
go
for
a
walk
unchaperoned
patty
had
learned
the
ethics
of
london
etiquette
for
girls
of
eighteen
but
she
was
not
versed
in
the
ways
of
older
young
women
we
see
about
it
she
said
and
then
she
almost
laughed
outright
at
the
sudden
thought
of
snowden
surprise
should
he
see
her
next
day
in
one
of
her
own
simple
morning
frocks
of
light
muslin
lady
hamilton
morning
gowns
were
paris
affairs
with
trailing
frills
and
long
knotted
ribbons
it
seems
to
amuse
you
said
snowden
a
trifle
piqued
at
her
merriment
you
be
amused
too
she
said
if
you
see
me
then
something
in
the
man
pleasant
face
seemed
to
invite
confidence
and
she
said
impulsively
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
masquerading
i
not
a
lady
at
all
i
not
much
more
than
a
schoolgirl
not
quite
eighteen
years
old
but
but
my
box
did
come
and
and
i
had
to
wear
lady
hamilton
gown
it
makes
me
seem
a
lot
older
i
know
but
i
had
to
do
it
or
stay
away
from
dinner
snowden
looked
first
amazed
and
then
he
burst
into
laughter
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
he
said
but
i
had
no
idea
and
so
lady
hamilton
is
your
chaperon
i
see
of
course
well
we
have
the
stroll
just
the
same
if
you
will
and
we
ask
her
to
go
with
us
is
she
the
dearest
thing
exclaimed
patty
looking
at
lady
kitty
across
the
table
and
feeling
much
more
at
her
ease
now
that
she
had
confessed
her
position
she
is
a
beautiful
and
charming
woman
agreed
snowden
and
then
it
was
time
for
patty
to
turn
back
to
merivale
for
she
had
learned
that
one
must
divide
the
time
fairly
between
dinner
neighbors
i
did
offend
you
did
i
said
young
merivale
eagerly
you
turned
so
quickly
and
and
you
er
blushed
you
know
and
so
i
was
afraid
er
but
patty
was
of
no
mind
to
confess
the
fewness
of
her
years
to
everybody
and
her
mischievous
spirit
returned
as
she
determined
to
chaff
this
amusing
young
man
what
she
said
reproachfully
an
englishman
and
afraid
afraid
of
nothing
but
a
fair
lady
displeasure
all
true
englishmen
surrender
to
that
i
not
displeased
said
patty
dimpling
and
smiling
in
fact
even
forgotten
what
you
said
that
good
now
we
can
start
fresh
will
you
save
a
lot
of
dances
for
me
oh
will
there
be
dancing
exclaimed
patty
delighted
at
the
prospect
yes
indeed
in
the
big
ballroom
will
you
give
me
all
the
waltzes
patty
looked
at
him
in
amazement
you
said
you
were
going
to
fresh
she
said
and
now
you
certainly
done
so
but
the
american
phrase
was
lost
on
the
englishman
who
only
proceeded
to
repeat
his
request
meantime
snowden
was
asking
patty
for
a
dance
certainly
she
said
i
shall
be
pleased
to
dance
with
you
you
give
me
more
than
one
dance
or
you
need
give
me
any
grumbled
young
merivale
all
right
said
patty
quickly
snowden
i
just
had
a
dance
with
thanks
so
you
can
have
that
if
you
wish
it
i
do
indeed
he
replied
enthusiastically
and
merivale
relapsed
into
a
sulky
silence
then
lady
herenden
rose
from
the
table
and
the
ladies
all
rose
and
followed
her
up
to
one
of
the
beautiful
salons
where
coffee
was
served
to
them
patty
managed
to
secure
a
seat
on
a
divan
beside
lady
hamilton
you
quite
take
my
breath
away
little
patty
said
her
friend
in
a
low
voice
you
are
already
a
favourite
and
in
a
fair
way
to
become
the
belle
of
the
ball
i
try
not
to
act
too
old
kitty
said
patty
earnestly
but
truly
everybody
thinks
i
a
society
lady
they
do
even
look
on
me
as
a
débutante
never
mind
dearie
have
all
the
fun
you
can
enjoy
the
dancing
and
do
care
what
anybody
thinks
encouraged
by
lady
hamilton
approval
patty
ceased
to
think
about
her
demeanour
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
the
conversation
of
those
about
her
lady
herenden
was
especially
kind
to
her
and
singled
out
the
young
american
for
her
special
favour
and
attention
chapter
viii
the
earl
of
ruthven
after
a
time
the
men
came
from
the
and
rejoined
the
ladies
patty
was
chatting
with
a
group
of
young
women
and
when
she
glanced
around
it
was
to
see
lord
ruthven
standing
at
her
side
i
was
miles
away
from
you
at
dinner
he
said
but
now
there
is
an
opportunity
let
us
begin
our
lessons
in
english
at
once
do
said
patty
smiling
where
shall
be
our
classroom
we
this
sofa
said
lord
ruthven
indicating
as
he
spoke
a
louis
xiv
we
pretend
that
it
is
a
real
schoolroom
with
four
walls
hung
with
maps
and
charts
just
such
as
you
used
to
have
when
you
were
a
little
girl
patty
smiled
at
this
reference
to
her
but
fell
in
with
his
mood
yes
she
said
and
you
must
be
the
stern
schoolmaster
and
i
the
stupid
pupil
who
has
been
kept
in
after
school
but
their
merry
game
was
interrupted
by
lady
herenden
invitation
to
the
ballroom
escorted
by
lord
ruthven
patty
followed
the
others
to
the
great
hall
where
they
were
to
dance
it
was
a
resplendent
apartment
with
balconies
and
boxes
from
which
the
spectators
could
look
down
upon
the
dancers
a
fine
orchestra
furnished
the
music
and
patty
who
loved
to
dance
found
her
feet
involuntarily
keeping
time
to
the
harmonious
strains
shall
we
have
a
try
said
lord
ruthven
and
in
a
moment
they
were
gliding
over
the
smooth
floor
patty
already
knew
that
english
dancing
is
not
like
the
american
steps
but
she
was
so
completely
mistress
of
the
art
that
she
could
adapt
herself
instantly
to
any
variation
i
wo
compliment
your
dancing
said
the
earl
as
the
waltz
was
finished
for
you
must
have
been
told
so
often
how
wonderfully
well
you
dance
but
i
must
tell
you
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
dance
with
you
patty
thought
this
a
very
pretty
speech
and
graciously
gave
his
lordship
some
other
dances
for
which
he
asked
and
then
leaving
her
with
lady
herenden
he
excused
himself
and
went
away
then
patty
was
besieged
with
partners
her
dancing
had
called
forth
the
admiration
of
everybody
and
the
young
men
crowded
about
begging
to
see
her
only
merivale
stood
aloof
he
was
still
sulky
and
he
looked
so
like
a
cross
schoolboy
that
patty
took
pity
on
him
she
slightly
nodded
her
head
at
him
by
way
of
invitation
and
he
came
slowly
toward
her
which
two
do
you
want
she
said
demurely
merivale
face
lighted
up
you
are
indeed
kind
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
take
any
you
will
give
me
my
card
is
blank
as
yet
so
patty
arranged
the
dances
and
the
young
man
went
away
looking
much
happier
the
evening
was
all
too
short
patty
whirled
through
dance
after
dance
and
between
them
was
restored
to
lady
herenden
or
lady
hamilton
only
to
be
claimed
the
next
minute
by
another
partner
what
a
belle
it
is
said
lady
herenden
patting
the
girl
shoulder
affectionately
you
have
made
a
real
sensation
miss
fairfield
but
i
cinderella
she
said
gaily
wait
till
and
see
all
my
popularity
vanish
lady
herenden
did
not
understand
but
took
it
as
merry
chaff
and
paid
no
heed
then
lord
ruthven
came
for
the
last
dance
this
is
an
extra
miss
fairfield
he
said
will
you
give
it
to
me
patty
agreed
but
as
they
walked
away
his
lordship
said
you
look
really
tired
would
you
not
rather
sit
on
the
terrace
than
dance
i
am
tired
said
patty
honestly
i
think
it
carrying
this
heavy
train
around
i
never
before
danced
in
a
long
gown
then
you
shall
rest
let
us
sit
on
the
terrace
and
i
send
for
an
ice
for
you
lord
ruthven
was
very
kind
and
courteous
he
found
a
delightful
corner
of
the
terrace
unoccupied
and
he
arranged
two
wicker
where
they
might
be
just
out
of
the
way
of
the
promenaders
he
asked
a
footman
to
bring
the
ices
and
then
seated
himself
beside
patty
is
it
not
beautiful
he
said
the
rose
garden
in
the
moonlight
one
can
almost
fancy
the
roses
opening
beneath
the
moon
light
as
in
daytime
by
the
sun
warm
rays
yes
said
patty
falling
in
with
his
fanciful
mood
and
i
think
perhaps
at
night
the
white
roses
and
the
pale
yellow
ones
bloom
then
at
daybreak
the
pink
or
blush
roses
open
and
at
midday
the
deep
red
ones
you
have
the
mind
of
a
poet
miss
fairfield
where
do
you
get
those
graceful
conceits
oh
i
do
know
said
patty
carelessly
i
think
they
are
the
result
of
this
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
these
picturesque
surroundings
yes
i
am
sure
that
is
true
you
have
a
soul
that
responds
to
all
beauty
in
art
or
nature
let
us
take
a
short
turn
in
the
rose
garden
and
get
a
view
of
this
noble
old
house
with
the
moonlight
full
upon
it
but
i
want
my
ice
cream
objected
patty
who
still
had
her
schoolgirl
appetite
we
stay
but
a
moment
and
we
return
to
find
it
awaiting
us
gently
insisted
lord
ruthven
and
patty
amiably
went
down
the
terrace
steps
and
along
the
garden
path
with
him
near
a
clump
of
cedars
only
a
short
distance
away
they
turned
to
look
at
the
beautiful
old
house
herenden
hall
was
always
a
splendid
picture
but
especially
at
night
backgrounded
by
a
gray
sky
full
of
racing
clouds
and
touched
at
every
gable
by
the
silver
moonlight
it
was
enchanting
oh
said
patty
drawing
a
sigh
it
is
the
most
wonderful
effect
i
ever
saw
see
that
great
quiet
roof
sloping
darkly
away
and
beneath
the
gay
lights
of
the
terrace
and
the
laughter
of
happy
people
it
is
a
beautiful
picture
said
lord
ruthven
looking
steadily
at
patty
but
not
so
beautiful
as
another
one
i
see
a
lovely
face
framed
in
soft
shining
curls
against
a
background
of
dark
cedar
trees
his
tone
even
more
than
his
words
alarmed
patty
she
was
not
used
to
such
speeches
as
this
and
she
said
gravely
take
me
back
to
the
house
please
lord
ruthven
not
just
yet
pleaded
the
nobleman
dear
miss
fairfield
listen
to
me
a
moment
let
me
tell
you
something
let
me
justify
myself
i
ought
to
talk
to
you
like
this
i
know
but
the
fact
is
oh
the
fact
is
completely
bowled
me
over
what
said
patty
not
at
all
comprehending
his
meaning
yes
i
done
for
and
at
first
sight
and
by
an
american
but
it
a
fact
i
adore
you
miss
fairfield
i
so
desperately
in
love
with
you
that
i
ca
down
it
oh
i
know
i
ought
to
be
talking
to
you
like
this
i
ought
to
see
your
father
and
all
that
and
i
will
as
soon
as
i
can
but
oh
i
say
patty
tell
me
you
like
me
a
little
it
suddenly
dawned
on
patty
that
she
was
having
a
proposal
and
from
an
english
earl
and
all
on
account
of
her
gown
the
absurdity
of
it
impressed
her
far
more
than
the
romantic
side
of
it
and
though
a
little
frightened
she
could
help
smiling
at
the
earl
tragic
tones
nonsense
lord
ruthven
she
said
though
her
cheeks
were
pink
talk
like
that
please
cut
me
that
lovely
cluster
of
roses
and
then
take
me
back
to
lady
hamilton
the
earl
drew
a
penknife
from
his
pocket
and
cut
the
flowers
she
asked
for
then
he
stood
trimming
off
the
thorns
and
looking
down
at
her
patty
had
never
looked
so
winsome
her
garb
made
her
seem
a
grown
woman
and
yet
the
situation
alarmed
her
and
her
perplexed
face
was
that
of
a
troubled
child
tell
me
he
repeated
that
you
like
me
a
little
of
course
i
like
you
a
little
returned
patty
in
a
voice
why
should
i
that
something
said
the
earl
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
and
now
will
you
accept
these
flowers
as
a
gift
from
me
as
for
the
moment
nothing
else
to
offer
patty
took
the
flowers
in
both
hands
but
lord
ruthven
still
held
them
too
saying
and
will
you
let
them
mean
no
cried
patty
they
do
mean
anything
not
anything
at
all
lord
ruthven
clasped
patty
two
hands
roses
and
all
in
his
own
they
do
he
said
quietly
they
mean
i
love
you
do
you
understand
he
looked
straight
into
the
troubled
beseeching
eyes
that
met
his
own
please
let
me
go
lord
ruthven
said
patty
her
hands
trembling
in
his
own
you
may
go
if
you
will
first
call
me
by
some
less
formal
name
patty
dearest
say
sylvester
just
once
this
desperate
request
was
too
much
for
patty
sense
of
humour
why
ca
i
say
it
twice
she
said
in
a
low
tone
but
her
voice
was
shaking
with
laughter
you
little
witch
exclaimed
the
earl
and
his
clasp
tightened
on
her
hands
now
you
sha
go
until
you
said
it
twice
sylvester
sylvester
there
said
patty
her
eyes
twinkling
with
fun
and
her
lips
on
the
verge
of
laughter
then
gently
disengaging
her
hands
from
his
she
gathered
up
her
long
white
train
and
prepared
to
run
away
the
earl
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
arm
miss
fairfield
he
said
patty
i
wo
keep
you
now
but
you
give
me
an
opportunity
wo
you
to
tell
you
wait
till
my
lord
said
patty
really
laughing
now
you
will
probably
have
changed
your
mind
how
little
you
know
me
he
cried
reproachfully
and
then
they
had
reached
the
terrace
and
joined
the
others
soon
after
the
guests
all
retired
to
their
own
rooms
and
the
moonlight
on
herenden
hall
saw
no
more
the
gay
scene
on
the
terrace
patty
passing
through
her
own
room
discovered
that
her
two
trunks
had
arrived
and
had
been
unpacked
she
went
straight
on
and
tapped
at
lady
hamilton
door
get
me
out
of
this
gown
please
marie
i
had
quite
enough
of
being
a
young
woman
what
the
matter
patty
said
lady
kitty
looking
round
did
you
have
a
good
time
this
evening
the
time
of
my
life
declared
patty
dropping
into
her
own
graphic
speech
as
she
emerged
from
the
heap
of
lace
and
silk
i
see
you
later
kitty
and
without
further
word
she
returned
to
her
own
room
and
later
when
marie
had
been
dismissed
patty
crept
back
to
lady
hamilton
a
very
different
patty
indeed
her
hair
fell
in
two
long
braids
with
curly
tails
a
dainty
enveloped
her
slight
figure
and
on
her
bare
feet
were
heelless
satin
slippers
she
found
lady
kitty
in
an
armchair
before
the
wood
fire
awaiting
her
patty
threw
a
big
fat
sofa
pillow
at
her
friend
feet
and
settled
herself
cosily
upon
it
well
girlie
said
lady
hamilton
come
to
the
story
at
once
what
happened
to
you
as
a
what
usually
happens
to
i
suppose
said
patty
demurely
the
earl
of
ruthven
proposed
to
me
what
cried
lady
hamilton
starting
up
and
quite
upsetting
patty
from
her
cushion
yes
he
did
went
on
patty
placidly
shall
i
accept
him
patty
you
naughty
child
tell
me
all
about
it
at
once
oh
what
shall
i
say
to
your
father
and
mother
patty
grinned
yes
it
was
all
your
fault
kitty
if
i
had
worn
your
gown
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
but
patty
it
be
true
you
must
have
misunderstood
him
not
i
it
my
first
proposal
to
be
sure
but
i
know
what
a
man
means
when
he
says
he
loves
me
and
begs
me
to
call
him
by
his
first
name
and
i
did
twice
patty
went
off
in
shrieks
of
laughter
at
the
remembrance
of
it
and
she
rocked
back
and
forth
on
her
cushion
in
paroxysms
of
mirth
patty
behave
yourself
and
tell
me
the
truth
i
a
mind
to
shake
you
i
shaking
said
patty
trying
to
control
her
voice
and
i
telling
you
the
truth
his
first
name
is
sylvester
lovely
name
where
did
this
occur
in
the
rose
garden
oh
right
near
the
terrace
not
a
dozen
yards
away
from
you
all
i
sure
if
you
been
listening
you
could
have
heard
me
say
again
patty
went
off
in
uncontrollable
merriment
at
this
recollection
and
lady
kitty
had
to
laugh
too
what
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
to
wait
till
and
he
probably
change
his
mind
and
i
see
my
trunks
have
come
so
he
surely
will
you
see
he
proposed
to
that
gown
and
jewelled
tiara
i
had
on
it
was
a
tiara
well
it
looked
something
like
one
i
sure
he
thought
it
was
he
doubtless
wants
a
dignified
stately
lady
ruthven
and
he
thought
i
was
oh
kitty
if
you
could
have
heard
him
i
do
think
it
nice
of
you
to
take
him
that
way
all
right
i
wo
but
i
not
going
to
take
him
at
all
why
kitty
when
he
sees
me
in
my
own
little
pink
muslin
he
wo
know
me
let
alone
remembering
what
he
said
to
me
patty
you
incorrigible
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
but
i
hope
your
parents
wo
blame
me
for
this
of
course
they
wo
kitsie
you
see
it
was
an
accident
a
sort
of
case
of
mistaken
identity
i
do
mind
it
so
much
now
that
it
over
but
i
was
scared
stiff
at
the
time
only
it
was
all
so
funny
that
it
swallowed
up
my
scare
now
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
so
patty
told
every
word
that
the
earl
had
said
to
her
during
the
evening
in
the
ballroom
and
on
the
terrace
and
lady
hamilton
listened
attentively
you
were
not
a
bit
to
blame
dear
she
said
kindly
when
the
tale
was
finished
i
do
think
you
even
flirted
with
him
but
it
truly
extraordinary
that
he
should
speak
so
soon
it
was
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
declared
patty
with
conviction
you
know
moonlight
and
roses
and
a
summer
evening
have
a
romantic
influence
on
some
natures
what
do
you
know
of
a
romantic
influence
you
baby
hop
along
to
bed
now
and
get
up
in
the
morning
your
own
sweet
natural
self
without
a
thought
of
earls
or
moonlight
i
will
so
said
patty
i
did
like
it
a
bit
except
that
it
was
all
so
funny
wo
nan
howl
she
may
but
i
afraid
your
father
will
be
annoyed
you
know
you
in
my
care
patty
do
you
worry
i
tell
daddy
all
about
it
and
i
rather
guess
it
will
make
him
laugh
chapter
ix
an
important
document
it
was
the
custom
at
herenden
hall
to
serve
morning
tea
to
the
guests
in
their
rooms
when
patty
tray
was
brought
she
asked
to
have
it
taken
into
lady
hamilton
room
and
the
two
friends
chatted
cosily
over
their
toast
and
teacups
lady
kitty
with
a
dainty
round
her
shoulders
was
still
nestled
among
her
pillows
while
patty
in
a
blue
kimono
curled
up
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
a
gorgeous
day
observed
patty
stirring
her
tea
which
she
was
trying
to
sip
though
she
hated
it
i
be
glad
to
explore
that
lovely
rose
garden
without
horrid
old
moonlit
earls
it
a
wonderfully
fine
place
patty
you
really
must
go
over
the
estate
i
show
you
round
myself
thank
you
said
patty
airily
but
i
believe
i
have
an
engagement
snowden
or
snowed
on
or
snowed
under
or
whatever
his
name
is
kindly
offered
to
do
that
same
yes
and
he
kindly
withdraw
his
offer
when
he
sees
you
in
your
own
rightful
raiment
i
a
notion
to
put
you
in
a
pinafore
and
give
you
a
teddy
bear
to
carry
there
no
keeping
you
down
any
other
way
oh
do
be
alarmed
i
no
designs
on
the
young
men
i
like
the
boys
better
anyhow
that
jack
merivale
is
a
chummy
kind
of
a
youth
the
sort
i
like
rest
assured
i
wo
trouble
that
wretched
earl
i
even
speak
to
him
and
i
make
over
to
you
whatever
interest
he
may
deign
to
show
in
me
as
one
humpty
dumpty
said
rather
see
that
on
paper
so
you
shall
said
patty
and
setting
down
her
unfinished
tea
she
flew
to
the
writing
table
perching
herself
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
chair
she
laid
out
a
sheet
of
lady
herenden
crested
note
paper
and
took
up
a
pen
shall
i
write
the
agreement
as
i
please
she
said
or
will
you
dictate
it
i
dictate
said
lady
kitty
smiling
lazily
at
the
foolery
but
as
she
paused
between
sentences
patty
put
in
parentheses
of
her
own
and
when
finished
the
remarkable
document
read
thus
i
the
undersigned
being
of
fairly
sound
mind
do
hereby
of
my
own
free
will
coerced
by
one
lady
hamilton
relinquish
all
interest
or
concern
in
the
illustrious
personage
known
as
sylvester
earl
of
ruthven
but
i
do
think
he
has
a
lovely
name
and
should
he
show
any
interest
in
me
personally
i
promise
gladly
to
refer
him
to
the
aforesaid
lady
hamilton
though
what
she
wants
of
him
i
know
and
i
hereby
solemnly
promise
and
agree
not
to
seek
or
accept
any
further
acquaintance
or
friendship
with
the
belted
gentleman
above
referred
to
furthermore
i
being
still
of
sound
mind
but
it
tottering
promise
not
to
talk
or
converse
with
the
sylvester
earl
of
ruthven
beyond
the
ordinary
civilities
of
the
day
whatever
that
may
mean
never
to
smile
at
him
voluntarily
i
ca
help
laughing
at
him
and
to
wave
my
eyelashes
at
him
across
the
table
does
she
think
i
do
that
witness
my
hand
and
seal
patricia
fairfield
lady
patricia
would
sound
great
would
it
there
kitty
cat
said
patty
tossing
the
paper
to
lady
hamilton
there
your
agreement
and
now
my
dreams
of
glory
over
i
go
and
my
hair
and
lace
my
bodice
blue
i
always
wondered
how
people
bind
their
hair
do
you
suppose
they
use
skirt
braid
but
lady
kitty
was
shaking
with
laughter
over
patty
foolish
document
and
offered
no
reply
an
hour
or
so
later
patty
presented
herself
for
inspection
she
wore
a
pale
blue
dimity
whose
round
full
blouse
was
belted
with
a
soft
ribbon
the
skirt
with
its
three
frills
edged
with
tiny
lace
came
just
to
her
instep
and
disclosed
dainty
oxfords
her
golden
braids
crossed
and
recrossed
low
at
the
back
of
her
head
were
almost
covered
by
a
big
butterfly
bow
of
wide
white
ribbon
in
fact
she
was
perfectly
garbed
for
an
american
girl
of
eighteen
and
the
costume
was
more
becoming
to
her
pretty
young
face
than
the
trained
gown
of
the
night
before
lady
hamilton
was
still
at
her
dressing
table
i
feel
quite
at
ease
about
you
now
she
said
looking
up
nobody
will
propose
to
you
in
that
rig
they
be
more
likely
to
buy
you
a
doll
not
nearly
ready
yet
but
do
wait
run
along
downstairs
you
find
plenty
of
people
about
slowly
patty
descended
the
great
staircase
looking
at
the
pictures
and
hanging
rugs
as
she
passed
them
for
mercy
sake
who
is
that
was
lady
herenden
mental
exclamation
as
the
girl
neared
the
lower
floor
lady
herenden
cried
patty
gaily
as
she
approached
her
hostess
do
look
so
surprised
to
see
me
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
why
it
miss
fairfield
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
making
room
for
patty
on
the
sofa
beside
her
yes
and
i
really
owe
you
an
explanation
you
see
my
boxes
did
come
last
night
and
i
had
to
wear
one
of
lady
hamilton
gowns
at
dinner
i
could
tell
you
so
before
all
the
guests
and
so
you
did
know
me
this
morning
in
my
own
frock
it
astonishing
what
a
difference
it
makes
you
look
years
younger
i
am
i
not
quite
eighteen
yet
and
i
wish
you
call
me
patty
you
i
will
indeed
said
lady
herenden
answering
the
pretty
smile
that
accompanied
the
request
i
knew
kitty
hamilton
said
you
were
out
yet
and
so
when
i
saw
you
last
night
i
just
could
understand
it
but
i
do
now
have
you
breakfasted
dearie
yes
thank
you
and
now
i
want
to
go
out
and
see
the
flowers
and
the
dogs
may
i
yes
indeed
run
around
as
you
like
you
find
people
on
the
terrace
and
lawn
though
there
are
no
girls
here
as
young
as
yourself
that
does
matter
i
like
people
of
all
ages
i
friends
from
four
to
forty
i
not
surprised
you
a
friendly
little
thing
be
sure
to
go
through
the
rose
orchard
it
back
of
the
rose
garden
and
you
love
it
hatless
patty
ran
out
into
the
sunshine
and
strolling
through
the
rose
garden
soon
forgot
all
else
in
her
delight
at
the
marvellous
array
of
blossoms
as
she
turned
a
corner
of
a
path
she
came
upon
two
men
talking
together
they
were
lord
ruthven
and
lord
herenden
head
gardener
yes
his
lordship
was
saying
you
done
a
good
thing
parker
in
getting
that
hybrid
and
this
next
bush
is
a
fine
one
too
is
it
a
baroness
rothschild
no
said
patty
carelessly
joining
in
the
conversation
it
a
catherine
mermet
so
it
is
miss
said
the
gardener
turning
politely
toward
her
but
lord
ruthven
after
a
slight
glance
paid
no
attention
to
the
girl
are
you
sure
parker
he
said
the
mermets
are
usually
pinker
he
does
know
me
what
larks
thought
patty
gleefully
i
try
again
where
is
the
rose
orchard
parker
she
asked
turning
her
full
face
toward
the
gardener
and
leaving
only
the
big
white
bow
to
greet
the
earl
something
in
her
voice
startled
lord
ruthven
and
he
wheeled
quickly
about
it
is
it
ca
be
miss
fairfield
my
lord
said
patty
with
cool
politeness
this
of
course
she
thought
to
herself
is
the
civility
of
the
day
i
will
show
you
the
rose
orchard
went
on
the
earl
come
with
me
no
thank
you
said
patty
turning
again
to
the
gardener
she
was
absurdly
placed
and
she
felt
a
little
embarrassed
but
on
the
other
hand
she
had
pledged
her
word
and
a
silly
performance
it
was
but
she
would
keep
it
at
least
until
lady
hamilton
released
her
from
her
promise
patty
ideas
of
honour
were
perhaps
a
little
strained
but
she
took
the
promise
of
that
burlesque
document
as
seriously
as
if
it
had
been
of
national
importance
and
now
she
was
in
a
dilemma
to
refuse
to
walk
with
the
earl
was
so
rude
and
yet
to
talk
with
him
was
to
break
her
pledged
word
the
gardener
went
on
about
his
work
and
the
other
two
stood
silent
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
patty
had
a
really
difficult
situation
to
cope
with
if
she
could
have
laughed
and
talked
naturally
it
would
have
been
easy
to
explain
matters
but
that
absurd
paper
sealed
her
lips
oh
why
had
she
been
so
foolish
she
did
not
look
at
the
earl
but
he
gazed
fixedly
at
her
i
do
understand
he
said
why
are
you
so
changed
from
last
evening
patty
thought
hard
she
was
allowed
the
civilities
of
the
day
so
she
must
depend
on
those
is
it
a
charming
morning
she
said
without
however
turning
toward
the
man
at
her
side
it
is
indeed
but
why
are
you
such
an
enigma
are
all
americans
so
puzzling
and
is
the
rose
garden
wonderful
went
on
patty
still
looking
off
in
the
distance
wonderful
of
course
please
look
at
me
i
believe
after
all
miss
fairfield
younger
sister
ah
i
have
guessed
you
at
last
patty
still
looked
straight
ahead
but
an
irrepressible
smile
dimpled
the
corners
of
her
mouth
do
you
think
it
will
rain
she
said
by
jove
i
wo
stand
this
cried
the
earl
impetuously
i
know
you
are
yourself
the
miss
fairfield
i
talked
with
last
night
but
why
masquerading
as
a
schoolgirl
i
do
know
at
this
patty
could
restrain
her
mirth
no
longer
and
her
pretty
laughter
seemed
to
appease
the
earl
irritation
am
i
not
fit
to
be
looked
at
or
spoken
to
he
said
more
gently
and
if
not
you
must
at
least
tell
me
why
i
ca
tell
you
why
said
patty
stifling
her
laughter
but
still
gazing
at
the
hills
why
ca
you
have
you
promised
not
to
the
earl
meant
this
as
a
jest
little
thinking
it
was
the
truth
but
patty
now
nearly
choking
with
merriment
said
demurely
yes
sir
nonsense
i
not
going
to
eat
you
look
at
me
child
i
ca
repeated
patty
in
a
small
voice
and
holding
her
wilful
golden
head
very
straight
as
she
stared
firmly
ahead
whom
did
you
promise
you
have
no
right
to
ask
that
said
patty
to
herself
is
an
ordinary
but
i
ca
help
it
i
have
a
right
to
ask
and
i
do
care
whether
i
have
or
not
you
a
mischief
and
i
wo
stand
any
more
of
your
chaff
who
made
you
promise
not
to
speak
to
me
or
look
at
me
the
earl
quietly
but
with
a
decided
air
moved
around
until
he
faced
patty
and
the
laughing
blue
eyes
were
so
full
of
fun
that
he
laughed
too
you
ridiculous
baby
he
cried
what
are
you
anyway
one
night
a
charming
young
woman
the
next
day
a
naughty
child
i
naughty
nobody
made
me
promise
i
did
it
of
my
own
free
will
but
whom
did
you
promise
lady
hamilton
said
patty
remembering
all
at
once
that
the
matter
was
to
be
referred
to
her
oho
well
now
see
here
you
just
break
that
promise
as
quick
as
you
can
and
i
make
it
square
with
lady
hamilton
will
you
said
patty
drawing
a
long
sigh
of
relief
and
will
you
blot
out
last
evening
and
pretend
it
never
was
and
begin
our
acquaintance
from
now
i
will
said
the
earl
looking
at
her
curiously
if
you
will
tell
me
why
you
seem
to
have
a
dual
personality
then
patty
explained
her
appearance
at
dinner
in
lady
hamilton
gown
and
to
her
pleased
surprise
the
earl
laughed
long
and
loudly
best
joke
ever
he
declared
a
baby
like
you
giving
an
imitation
of
the
of
the
ball
i
not
so
infantile
said
patty
pouting
a
little
for
the
earl
now
treated
her
as
if
she
were
about
twelve
you
are
he
declared
you
ought
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
eating
bread
and
jam
i
like
the
bread
and
jam
well
enough
for
i
getting
hungrier
every
minute
well
it
an
hour
yet
to
luncheon
time
come
along
and
i
show
you
the
rose
orchard
it
may
make
you
forget
your
gnawing
pangs
of
hunger
on
pleasant
terms
then
they
went
through
the
gate
in
the
high
hedge
that
surrounded
the
enclosure
the
rose
orchard
was
unique
it
had
originally
been
a
fruit
orchard
and
as
most
of
the
trees
were
dead
and
many
of
them
fallen
roses
had
been
trained
over
their
trunks
and
branches
the
gorgeous
masses
of
bloom
covered
the
old
gnarled
wood
and
the
climbing
roses
twined
lovingly
around
branches
and
boughs
here
and
there
were
rustic
seats
and
arbours
and
there
were
many
whose
tiny
occupants
were
exceedingly
tame
and
sociable
several
other
guests
were
walking
about
and
patty
and
the
earl
joined
a
group
which
included
their
host
and
hostess
how
do
you
like
it
said
lady
herenden
drawing
patty
arm
through
her
own
it
the
most
beautiful
place
since
the
garden
of
eden
said
patty
so
enthusiastically
that
everybody
laughed
then
snowden
sauntered
up
and
reminded
patty
of
her
promise
to
go
walking
with
him
you
have
seen
the
deer
park
yet
he
said
nor
the
carp
pond
though
i
believe
the
carp
are
merely
tradition
still
the
pond
is
there
run
along
child
said
lady
herenden
you
just
about
have
time
for
a
pleasant
stroll
before
luncheon
patty
was
greatly
relieved
when
snowden
made
no
reference
to
her
age
or
her
costume
he
treated
her
politely
and
chatted
gaily
as
he
led
her
around
to
see
all
the
picturesque
bits
of
woodland
and
meadow
the
magnificent
old
place
showed
its
age
for
it
had
not
been
unduly
renovated
though
everything
was
in
good
order
they
went
into
the
old
church
which
was
on
the
estate
they
visited
the
farmhouses
and
stables
and
patty
found
snowden
a
kind
and
entertaining
guide
chapter
x
a
momentous
interview
the
rest
of
their
stay
at
herenden
hall
passed
off
delightfully
patty
fitted
into
her
own
niche
and
everybody
liked
the
natural
unaffected
young
girl
she
and
jack
merivale
became
good
chums
and
went
fishing
together
and
rowing
on
the
pond
like
old
cronies
it
was
patty
nature
to
make
friends
quickly
and
during
her
stay
in
kent
she
had
a
royal
good
time
lord
ruthven
talked
over
the
matter
with
lady
hamilton
and
as
he
chose
to
consider
it
all
a
great
joke
on
himself
she
also
took
his
view
of
it
as
for
patty
she
was
so
engrossed
with
other
people
that
she
nearly
forgot
all
about
the
moonlight
episode
only
sometimes
when
she
chanced
to
catch
sight
of
lord
ruthven
she
would
say
to
herself
sylvester
and
then
turn
away
to
hide
her
laughter
they
stayed
over
until
tuesday
and
then
took
the
noon
train
back
to
london
lady
herenden
expressing
an
earnest
wish
that
patty
would
visit
her
again
lady
kitty
and
patty
reached
the
savoy
duly
and
fairfield
invited
the
returned
travellers
to
dinner
in
the
great
restaurant
this
was
a
treat
in
itself
and
patty
gleefully
ran
up
to
her
room
to
dress
for
dinner
lend
me
one
of
your
gowns
to
wear
kitty
she
said
roguishly
looking
in
at
her
friend
door
go
away
you
bad
child
you
not
in
my
care
now
i
shall
confess
all
to
your
father
at
dinner
and
then
i
done
with
you
you
chosen
a
wise
time
said
patty
sagely
father
always
especially
at
dinner
let
us
hope
he
will
be
said
lady
hamilton
who
was
really
a
little
anxious
about
it
all
but
she
need
not
have
been
for
when
the
story
was
told
both
and
fairfield
looked
upon
it
as
a
huge
joke
nan
especially
was
almost
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
account
patty
gave
of
the
moonlight
scene
and
her
tragic
repetition
in
a
stage
whisper
of
sylvester
was
truly
funny
of
itself
it
could
be
helped
said
fairfield
and
it
was
in
no
way
your
fault
lady
hamilton
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
shut
patty
in
her
room
on
such
a
gala
occasion
and
no
one
could
foresee
that
she
was
going
to
throw
herself
at
the
earl
head
father
exclaimed
patty
i
did
do
any
such
thing
he
threw
himself
at
my
feet
if
you
please
well
it
all
right
chickabiddy
but
do
let
it
happen
again
at
least
not
for
many
years
yet
i
suppose
some
time
in
the
far
future
i
shall
be
asked
to
be
a
to
a
duke
or
a
count
but
let
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
then
nan
will
be
dowager
duchess
cried
irrepressible
patty
that
be
fun
i
can
do
it
said
nan
with
an
air
of
that
made
them
all
laugh
i
glad
you
exonerate
me
said
lady
hamilton
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
since
i
let
patty
appear
too
old
i
going
to
average
matters
in
this
way
next
week
is
the
child
birthday
and
i
want
to
give
her
a
children
party
if
i
may
you
and
your
husband
may
come
fairfield
if
you
both
dress
as
children
of
tender
years
we
do
it
cried
fairfield
this
is
an
inspiration
of
yours
lady
hamilton
and
will
as
you
say
quite
even
things
up
then
plans
were
speedily
made
for
the
children
party
it
was
only
a
week
to
patty
birthday
but
lady
kitty
said
that
was
long
enough
ahead
to
send
invitations
to
an
afternoon
affair
for
the
party
was
to
be
held
from
three
to
six
and
each
guest
was
asked
to
dress
as
a
small
child
patty
put
considerable
thought
on
her
own
costume
for
she
said
her
eighteenth
birthday
was
an
important
occasion
and
she
must
do
it
honour
she
finally
decided
on
a
quaint
little
kate
greenaway
dress
and
hat
of
dark
green
velvet
with
white
feathers
tumbling
over
its
brim
the
frock
was
ankle
length
and
and
she
wore
little
slippers
with
crossed
ribbons
and
black
lace
mitts
a
shirred
silk
workbag
hung
at
her
side
and
she
carried
a
tiny
parasol
a
few
days
before
the
party
patty
had
an
inspiration
it
came
to
her
suddenly
as
most
inspirations
do
and
it
was
so
startling
that
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
i
do
it
she
said
to
herself
one
minute
and
i
do
it
she
said
to
herself
the
next
not
daring
to
think
long
about
it
lest
she
lose
her
determination
she
started
that
very
afternoon
on
her
surprising
errand
she
had
the
carriage
to
herself
for
she
had
been
to
tea
with
a
friend
and
on
her
way
home
she
asked
the
coachman
to
stop
at
a
house
in
carlton
terrace
reaching
the
house
patty
sent
her
card
in
by
the
footman
and
awaited
results
with
a
beating
heart
the
footman
returned
to
the
carriage
door
saying
sir
otho
markleham
would
be
pleased
to
see
miss
fairfield
and
resolutely
crushing
down
her
timidity
patty
went
in
she
was
ushered
into
a
large
and
formal
and
waited
there
a
few
moments
alone
she
wished
she
had
been
asked
into
a
library
or
some
more
cosy
room
for
the
stiff
hangings
and
massive
furniture
were
oppressive
but
she
had
no
time
for
further
thought
for
sir
otho
entered
the
room
he
bowed
with
exceeding
courtesy
but
with
a
surprised
air
which
was
indeed
only
natural
frightened
almost
out
of
her
wits
patty
extended
her
hand
and
though
she
tried
to
conquer
her
embarrassment
her
voice
trembled
as
she
said
how
do
you
do
sir
otho
i
come
to
see
you
she
tried
to
speak
jauntily
but
there
was
a
queer
little
break
in
her
voice
so
i
perceive
said
sir
otho
coldly
may
i
ask
why
i
have
this
honour
this
was
too
much
for
patty
her
nerves
were
strained
almost
to
the
breaking
point
and
when
sir
otho
spoke
so
repellently
she
realised
how
foolish
her
little
plan
had
been
and
how
hopeless
was
her
dream
of
reconciling
this
dreadful
old
man
and
his
daughter
partly
then
because
of
her
overwrought
nerves
and
partly
because
of
the
downfall
of
her
cherished
hopes
patty
burst
into
tears
she
rarely
cried
almost
never
unless
at
some
injustice
or
undeserved
unkindness
but
when
she
did
cry
it
was
done
as
she
did
everything
else
with
a
enthusiasm
utterly
unable
to
control
herself
for
a
few
moments
she
sobbed
and
shook
in
paroxysms
of
emotion
the
old
gentleman
fairly
danced
around
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
what
does
this
mean
did
you
come
into
my
house
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
fit
of
hysterics
now
patty
was
a
bit
hysterical
it
was
merely
a
sudden
blow
of
disappointment
and
she
would
have
been
over
it
in
a
moment
but
that
sir
otho
made
matters
worse
by
storming
at
her
stop
it
do
you
hear
i
wo
have
such
goings
on
in
my
house
you
are
a
madwoman
as
patty
sobs
grew
quieter
and
she
sat
softly
weeping
into
an
already
soaked
handkerchief
her
host
mood
seemed
to
change
also
when
i
consented
to
see
miss
patricia
fairfield
he
said
quoting
her
name
as
it
appeared
on
the
card
she
had
sent
in
i
did
know
i
was
to
be
subjected
to
this
extraordinary
treatment
i
know
it
said
patty
wiping
her
eyes
and
trying
to
smile
then
as
she
saw
sir
otho
hard
old
face
beginning
to
soften
a
little
she
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
there
there
my
dear
do
cry
he
said
with
a
clumsy
imitation
of
gentleness
shall
i
ring
for
a
maid
will
you
have
some
sal
volatile
no
said
patty
trying
hard
to
check
her
sobs
no
i
will
go
away
but
what
it
all
about
said
the
bewildered
old
man
what
made
you
cry
you
did
said
patty
with
such
suddenness
that
he
nearly
fell
over
i
bless
my
soul
what
did
i
do
you
were
so
said
patty
weeping
afresh
at
the
remembrance
of
his
cold
looks
well
never
mind
child
i
wo
be
cross
again
tell
me
all
about
it
surely
sir
otho
was
melting
patty
sagaciously
believed
he
was
touched
by
her
tears
so
made
no
desperate
effort
to
stop
them
i
tell
you
now
you
not
in
a
yes
i
am
try
to
tell
me
my
dear
child
patty
thought
she
had
never
known
any
one
who
could
turn
from
anger
to
kindness
so
suddenly
but
she
resolved
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
it
about
she
said
still
sobbing
but
peeping
out
from
behind
her
handkerchief
to
see
how
he
took
this
broadside
i
supposed
so
he
said
with
a
sigh
well
what
about
her
she
your
daughter
you
know
went
on
patty
growing
more
daring
as
she
slyly
watched
the
old
gentleman
expression
is
she
indeed
i
forgotten
the
fact
this
though
in
a
sarcastic
tone
was
better
than
his
usual
disavowal
of
the
relationship
and
did
you
stop
in
here
and
treat
me
to
this
absurd
scene
just
to
inform
me
concerning
my
family
tree
said
patty
resorting
to
tears
again
i
stopped
in
to
to
ask
you
well
out
with
it
are
you
afraid
of
me
this
nettled
patty
no
she
said
starting
to
her
feet
her
tears
had
stopped
now
and
her
eyes
were
blazing
no
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
sorry
i
broke
down
i
was
foolishly
nervous
but
i
over
it
now
i
came
in
here
sir
otho
markleham
to
ask
you
to
make
peace
with
your
daughter
and
to
propose
to
you
a
pleasant
way
to
do
so
but
you
have
been
so
cross
and
ugly
so
sarcastic
and
cruel
that
i
see
the
utter
hopelessness
of
trying
to
reconcile
you
two
i
was
foolish
even
to
think
of
it
lady
kitty
is
gentle
and
sweet
in
many
ways
but
she
has
inherited
your
obstinate
stubborn
pigheaded
suggested
sir
otho
politely
yes
pigheaded
disposition
and
though
as
the
older
you
ought
to
make
the
advance
you
never
do
it
and
she
never
will
and
so
patty
broke
down
again
this
time
from
sheer
sadness
of
heart
at
the
irrevocable
state
of
things
her
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
to
her
great
surprise
she
felt
a
kindly
touch
on
her
shoulder
do
condemn
me
too
soon
little
one
and
do
condemn
me
unheard
suppose
i
tell
you
that
some
of
my
ideas
have
undergone
a
change
since
miss
yankee
doodle
has
taken
it
upon
herself
to
scold
me
oh
said
patty
rendered
almost
breathless
with
amazement
at
the
kind
tone
and
the
gentle
touch
but
suppose
it
very
hard
for
an
old
man
like
me
to
uproot
some
feelings
that
have
grown
and
strengthened
with
the
passing
years
but
if
they
bad
and
unworthy
feelings
you
to
uproot
them
cried
patty
yes
said
sir
otho
i
do
and
though
my
irascible
and
taciturn
nature
wo
let
me
admit
this
to
any
one
else
i
confess
to
you
miss
yankee
doodle
i
do
want
to
pull
them
up
root
and
branch
sir
otho
looked
so
brave
and
manly
as
he
made
this
confession
which
was
truly
difficult
for
him
that
patty
grasped
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
cried
oh
what
a
man
you
are
i
be
afraid
of
you
again
you
afraid
of
me
child
that
why
your
words
had
weight
with
me
you
fearlessly
told
me
just
what
i
was
and
i
had
the
grace
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
never
mind
that
now
said
patty
eagerly
do
you
want
to
be
friends
again
with
kitty
more
than
anything
on
earth
well
then
let
me
manage
it
and
do
it
the
way
i
want
you
to
will
you
patty
voice
and
smile
were
very
wheedlesome
and
sir
otho
smiled
in
response
as
he
said
you
surely
earned
the
right
to
manage
it
how
shall
it
be
done
will
kitty
meet
me
halfway
i
think
she
will
said
patty
slowly
but
she
not
very
tractable
you
know
indeed
sir
otho
she
such
a
person
that
if
she
knew
you
wanted
to
be
kind
to
her
she
likely
run
away
miss
patricia
said
sir
otho
gravely
you
ca
tell
me
anything
about
my
daughter
catharine
that
i
do
already
know
and
she
is
indeed
on
occasion
as
you
so
justly
observed
she
inherits
my
obstinate
and
disposition
and
yet
she
so
lovely
to
look
at
sighed
patty
ah
well
she
did
get
her
good
looks
from
me
i
admit
i
think
she
did
said
patty
looking
critically
at
the
fine
old
face
with
a
thoughtful
gaze
that
was
very
amusing
well
are
you
going
to
detail
to
me
the
plan
of
this
rather
difficult
campaign
yes
i
am
and
i
hope
you
see
it
as
i
do
if
i
do
i
have
little
doubt
but
you
can
change
my
views
will
you
have
time
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
we
can
plan
so
much
more
cosily
over
the
teacups
yes
i
will
said
patty
consulting
her
watch
then
let
us
have
it
served
in
the
library
and
not
in
this
depressing
room
which
you
must
associate
with
stormy
outbursts
of
woe
patty
laughed
and
followed
the
stately
old
gentleman
into
the
library
where
tea
was
soon
served
illustration
pleasanter
this
is
than
squabbling
one
lump
said
patty
holding
the
poised
over
a
teacup
while
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
smiled
at
her
host
two
please
it
delightful
to
have
some
one
make
my
tea
for
me
and
you
do
it
very
prettily
but
alas
said
patty
in
mock
despair
i
soon
be
supplanted
here
by
that
lady
kitty
why
are
you
so
sure
she
come
back
here
to
live
just
give
her
the
chance
and
see
said
patty
wagging
her
head
sagaciously
as
she
poured
her
own
tea
how
pleasanter
this
is
than
squabbling
she
observed
glancing
happily
at
her
host
yes
or
crying
said
he
a
bit
teasingly
and
patty
blushed
that
past
history
she
said
and
i
tell
you
my
plan
the
details
of
the
plan
kept
them
both
talking
for
some
time
and
then
patty
had
to
hurry
away
to
reach
home
at
her
appointed
hour
now
i
wo
see
you
again
until
then
she
said
as
they
parted
at
the
door
but
i
know
you
wo
fail
me
not
i
said
sir
otho
and
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
he
made
a
profound
bow
and
patty
drove
homeward
in
the
happiest
mood
she
had
known
for
many
a
day
chapter
xi
the
birthday
party
patty
birthday
party
was
a
great
success
as
a
rule
young
people
love
a
party
and
the
guests
all
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
lady
hamilton
was
in
her
element
for
the
occasion
she
had
engaged
a
large
salon
and
aside
from
the
pretty
floral
decorations
there
were
dolls
and
teddy
bears
and
rocking
horses
and
all
sorts
of
children
toys
and
games
on
the
walls
hung
prints
intended
for
nursery
use
and
little
low
chairs
and
ottomans
stood
about
of
course
lady
hamilton
as
hostess
did
not
dress
like
a
child
but
wore
one
of
her
own
lovely
trailing
white
when
the
guests
arrived
they
were
shown
to
where
nurses
awaited
them
and
assisted
them
to
lay
aside
their
wraps
then
led
to
the
salon
by
these
same
nurses
the
guests
were
presented
to
lady
hamilton
and
patty
such
shouts
of
laughter
as
arose
at
these
presentations
the
young
people
dressed
as
tiny
children
came
in
with
a
shy
air
not
always
entirely
assumed
and
made
funny
little
bobbing
curtseys
some
finger
in
mouth
could
find
nothing
to
say
others
of
more
fertile
brain
babbled
childishly
or
lisped
in
before
many
had
arrived
patty
and
lady
kitty
were
in
such
roars
of
laughter
they
could
scarcely
welcome
the
rest
tom
meredith
was
a
dear
though
a
boy
nearly
six
feet
tall
he
had
a
round
cherubic
face
and
soft
curly
hair
he
wore
a
white
dress
of
simple
mother
hubbard
cut
the
fulness
hanging
from
a
yoke
and
ending
just
below
his
knees
in
frills
white
stockings
and
white
kid
pumps
adorned
his
feet
and
his
short
curls
were
tied
at
one
side
with
an
immense
white
bow
he
was
such
a
smiling
chap
and
looked
so
girlish
and
sweet
in
his
white
frock
that
patty
at
once
called
him
baby
belle
and
the
name
exactly
suited
him
did
you
come
all
alone
asked
lady
hamilton
yeth
replied
tom
rolling
up
his
eyes
in
pretended
diffidence
my
nurthie
went
to
a
ball
game
tho
i
had
to
come
all
by
mythelf
but
a
big
dirl
now
you
are
indeed
said
patty
glancing
at
his
stalwart
proportions
but
you
surely
the
belle
of
this
ball
grace
meredith
was
a
little
dutch
girl
and
was
charming
in
the
picturesque
holland
headgear
and
a
blue
gown
that
just
cleared
the
tops
of
her
clattering
wooden
sabots
she
talked
a
dutch
dialect
or
rather
what
she
imagined
was
such
and
if
not
real
hollandese
it
was
at
least
very
amusing
and
funny
mabel
hartley
looked
very
sweet
as
little
red
and
she
carried
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
which
contained
a
real
pat
of
butter
sinclair
and
bob
hartley
were
the
princes
in
the
tower
and
the
black
velvet
suits
and
white
lace
collars
were
exceedingly
becoming
to
them
they
wore
wigs
of
long
flaxen
hair
and
often
fell
into
the
pose
of
the
celebrated
picture
to
the
delight
of
all
who
saw
them
but
when
not
posing
as
a
tableau
they
were
so
full
of
antics
that
patty
told
them
they
were
more
like
court
jesters
than
princes
clowns
you
mean
said
bob
as
with
a
flash
of
his
black
satin
legs
he
over
sinclair
back
behave
yourselves
princes
admonished
patty
and
in
a
second
the
two
stood
motionless
side
by
side
as
in
the
great
painting
you
certainly
must
be
photographed
like
that
exclaimed
lady
hamilton
and
then
a
brilliant
idea
came
to
her
and
she
sent
a
message
at
once
to
a
photographer
to
send
one
of
his
men
and
a
camera
at
once
and
so
the
regular
programme
of
the
party
was
suspended
while
photographs
of
the
guests
were
taken
singly
and
in
groups
they
were
snapped
off
as
fast
as
the
camera
could
be
adjusted
and
lady
hamilton
promised
to
send
copies
to
their
homes
later
some
of
the
young
people
had
hired
very
elaborate
costumes
and
represented
celebrated
works
of
art
gainsborough
blue
boy
and
velasquez
maria
teresa
were
truly
beautiful
while
van
dyck
baby
stuart
made
a
lovely
picture
but
equally
interesting
were
the
less
pretentious
characters
and
costumes
simple
simon
was
a
favourite
with
all
a
faded
blue
smock
frock
and
a
battered
old
hat
formed
his
characteristic
garb
and
long
straight
yellow
locks
and
a
stupid
expression
of
face
made
him
look
like
the
traditional
simon
he
was
a
boy
of
much
original
wit
and
his
funny
repartee
proved
him
in
reality
far
from
little
miss
muffet
was
present
and
struwelpeter
and
alice
and
a
merry
brother
and
sister
had
to
cut
up
many
roguish
antics
before
they
were
recognised
as
the
heavenly
twins
mary
mary
quite
contrary
wore
a
pretty
dolly
varden
costume
and
carried
a
while
little
boy
blue
shyly
blew
his
horn
at
her
there
were
several
lord
fauntleroys
and
buster
browns
and
rollos
and
also
a
great
many
who
represented
nobody
in
particular
but
just
a
dear
little
child
fairfield
and
nan
though
they
had
said
they
would
come
to
the
party
dressed
as
children
had
changed
their
minds
and
arrived
later
than
the
others
wearing
the
garb
of
elderly
people
they
said
they
were
the
grandparents
come
to
look
at
the
children
enjoy
themselves
nan
made
a
very
sweet
old
lady
with
white
wig
and
gold
glasses
while
fairfield
pretended
to
be
an
old
man
cross
and
gouty
but
so
funny
was
his
ferocious
crustiness
that
nobody
felt
in
awe
of
him
led
by
lady
hamilton
the
boys
and
girls
played
all
sorts
of
merry
children
games
ring
around
a
rosy
london
bridge
is
falling
down
hide
the
thimble
and
other
such
infantile
entertainments
proved
exceedingly
the
big
babies
were
continually
crying
over
fancied
woes
and
sometimes
even
the
historic
characters
grew
humorously
quarrelsome
at
four
supper
was
served
the
children
were
formed
in
pairs
for
a
grand
march
to
the
strains
of
the
baby
opera
they
marched
to
another
room
where
a
long
table
was
set
for
them
at
each
place
was
a
set
and
a
mug
which
was
lettered
in
gilt
for
a
good
child
the
mugs
were
especially
pretty
ones
and
were
to
be
taken
home
as
souvenirs
at
each
place
was
a
bib
with
strings
and
when
these
were
tied
around
their
necks
the
big
children
looked
absurd
indeed
in
keeping
with
their
assumed
rôles
their
table
manners
were
not
impeccable
and
many
fists
pounded
on
the
table
while
babyish
voices
said
me
wants
me
thupper
or
div
me
some
but
though
the
bowls
and
mugs
betokened
infantile
fare
the
supper
really
served
included
dainty
salads
and
sandwiches
followed
by
ices
jellies
and
cakes
and
was
fully
enjoyed
by
the
healthy
appetites
which
belong
to
young
people
of
eighteen
or
thereabouts
after
supper
they
returned
to
the
for
a
dance
delightful
music
was
played
and
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
fancy
costumes
gracefully
flit
about
in
the
dance
when
it
was
nearly
time
to
go
home
one
of
the
nurses
came
to
lady
hamilton
saying
that
a
belated
guest
had
arrived
who
is
it
asked
lady
hamilton
surprised
that
any
one
should
arrive
so
late
he
says
he
is
peter
pan
answered
the
maid
show
him
in
at
once
said
lady
hamilton
we
surely
want
to
see
peter
pan
the
boy
who
never
grow
up
and
then
through
the
doorway
came
a
figure
that
unmistakably
represented
peter
pan
the
costume
of
russet
browns
and
tints
the
small
close
cap
with
its
single
feather
and
the
dagger
were
all
there
to
be
sure
it
was
a
much
peter
pan
than
any
of
them
had
seen
in
the
play
but
otherwise
it
was
surely
peter
at
first
lady
hamilton
looked
completely
bewildered
and
then
as
she
realised
that
it
was
really
her
own
father
she
turned
pale
and
then
very
pink
patty
stood
near
her
and
though
she
did
know
what
might
happen
she
felt
sure
lady
hamilton
would
be
quite
able
to
cope
with
the
situation
and
so
she
was
after
the
first
dazed
moment
she
stepped
forward
and
offering
her
hand
said
cordially
welcome
peter
pan
we
are
indeed
glad
to
see
you
we
sorry
you
could
come
earlier
but
pray
fall
right
into
place
with
the
rest
of
our
little
guests
it
was
the
nature
of
sir
otho
markleham
to
do
thoroughly
whatever
he
did
at
all
so
now
throwing
himself
into
the
spirit
of
the
moment
he
made
friends
with
the
young
people
at
once
he
entertained
them
with
stories
of
his
thrilling
adventures
with
the
pirates
he
told
them
how
he
lost
his
shadow
he
explained
all
about
fairies
and
soon
the
other
guests
were
all
crowded
about
him
listening
breathlessly
to
his
talk
lady
hamilton
standing
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
listening
group
looked
at
her
father
she
realised
at
once
what
it
all
meant
she
knew
that
patty
had
persuaded
him
to
come
and
that
it
meant
complete
reconciliation
between
father
and
daughter
the
whole
matter
could
be
discussed
later
if
they
chose
but
the
mere
presence
of
her
father
beneath
her
roof
meant
forgiveness
and
peace
between
them
softly
patty
came
up
beside
her
and
clasped
her
hand
you
a
witch
whispered
lady
hamilton
as
she
warmly
returned
the
pressure
how
did
you
ever
accomplish
this
never
mind
that
now
said
patty
her
eyes
shining
are
you
glad
glad
yes
only
that
a
short
word
to
express
my
joy
and
my
gratitude
to
you
but
you
took
a
risk
suppose
i
had
fainted
or
done
something
foolish
in
my
great
surprise
oh
i
knew
you
better
than
that
returned
patty
is
he
a
dear
in
that
peter
pan
suit
and
only
think
he
took
off
his
beloved
so
he
look
the
character
better
they
soon
grow
again
said
lady
hamilton
carelessly
but
what
i
ca
understand
is
why
he
came
at
all
because
he
loves
you
whispered
patty
and
you
love
him
and
both
been
acting
like
silly
geese
but
now
that
all
over
yes
it
is
and
lady
hamilton
gave
a
soft
sigh
of
relief
then
following
her
father
example
she
devoted
herself
to
her
young
guests
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
until
their
departure
of
course
these
young
people
knew
nothing
of
the
state
of
affairs
between
peter
pan
and
his
hostess
though
they
soon
discovered
the
identity
of
sir
otho
soon
after
six
the
children
went
away
declaring
that
it
had
been
the
event
of
the
season
and
they
had
never
enjoyed
a
party
more
the
three
fairfields
took
leave
at
the
same
time
and
lady
hamilton
was
left
alone
with
her
father
exactly
what
was
said
in
the
next
half
hour
neither
of
them
ever
told
but
when
it
was
past
the
two
were
entirely
reconciled
and
lady
kitty
had
consented
to
return
to
her
father
house
to
live
then
she
sent
a
note
to
the
fairfields
asking
them
all
to
dine
with
herself
and
her
father
that
evening
and
meantime
kitty
said
sir
otho
i
go
and
get
out
of
this
foolish
toggery
yes
but
save
that
suit
to
be
photographed
in
i
must
have
your
picture
to
put
with
those
of
the
other
sir
otho
went
away
enveloped
in
a
long
raincoat
and
promising
to
return
at
the
dinner
hour
it
was
a
merry
dinner
party
that
night
patty
had
a
new
frock
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
as
she
donned
the
pretty
of
pale
green
gauze
nan
said
it
was
the
most
becoming
costume
she
had
ever
worn
now
that
you
really
eighteen
patty
she
said
i
think
you
might
discard
no
thank
you
said
patty
as
louise
tied
her
big
white
bow
for
her
i
wear
them
a
little
longer
at
least
as
long
as
i
in
this
country
where
dukes
and
earls
run
wild
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
i
see
about
it
miss
yankee
doodle
said
sir
otho
as
he
met
her
again
at
dinner
once
more
the
american
has
conquered
the
english
and
i
would
be
greatly
honoured
by
your
kind
acceptance
of
this
tiny
memento
of
the
occasion
as
sir
otho
spoke
he
handed
patty
a
small
jeweller
box
she
opened
it
and
saw
a
dear
little
brooch
in
the
form
of
an
american
flag
the
stars
and
stripes
were
made
of
small
sparkling
brilliants
of
the
three
colours
and
the
twinkling
effect
was
very
beautiful
it
is
lovely
she
exclaimed
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
this
is
one
of
my
very
choicest
birthday
gifts
and
i
have
received
a
great
many
it
is
nothing
said
sir
otho
compared
to
what
you
have
given
me
and
he
glanced
affectionately
toward
his
daughter
and
this
was
all
he
ever
said
by
way
of
expressing
his
gratitude
to
patty
but
it
was
enough
for
the
deep
tone
of
his
voice
and
the
suggestion
of
tears
in
his
eyes
proved
his
inexpressible
appreciation
of
patty
achievement
then
the
matter
was
dropped
entirely
and
the
conversation
became
general
and
gay
sir
otho
proved
to
be
as
entertaining
to
older
people
as
he
had
been
to
the
children
at
the
party
and
lady
kitty
was
in
her
most
charming
mood
and
fairfield
quite
did
their
share
toward
the
general
entertainment
but
patty
was
queen
of
the
feast
she
enjoyed
it
all
for
she
dearly
loved
a
festivity
of
any
sort
but
she
was
specially
happy
to
think
that
her
plan
had
succeeded
and
that
she
had
given
to
her
dear
friend
kitty
what
she
most
wanted
in
all
the
world
and
i
trust
it
will
not
be
long
said
sir
otho
before
you
will
all
accept
an
invitation
to
dine
with
me
in
carlton
terrace
with
lady
hamilton
presiding
at
my
table
this
invitation
was
delightedly
accepted
and
then
they
all
went
up
to
the
fairfields
and
patty
sang
songs
and
they
all
sang
choruses
and
then
as
a
final
surprise
came
a
great
beautiful
birthday
cake
with
eighteen
lighted
candles
then
patty
cut
the
cake
and
there
were
more
congratulations
and
good
wishes
all
round
and
for
pretty
nearly
the
eighteenth
time
in
her
life
patty
declared
it
was
the
best
birthday
she
had
ever
had
chapter
xii
summer
plans
as
usual
said
fairfield
smiling
the
question
is
what
is
to
be
done
with
patty
yes
agreed
patty
complacently
you
and
nan
are
usually
trying
to
dispose
of
me
in
some
way
it
lucky
i
and
do
mind
being
left
behind
that
a
pretty
speech
exclaimed
nan
after
we
begged
and
coaxed
you
to
go
with
us
so
you
have
my
pretty
little
stepmother
so
you
have
and
i
just
ungrateful
enough
not
to
want
to
go
it
was
about
a
week
after
the
birthday
party
and
the
fairfields
were
making
their
plans
for
the
summer
the
elders
wanted
to
travel
in
switzerland
and
germany
patty
did
not
want
to
go
with
them
but
her
dilemma
was
which
of
several
delightful
invitations
to
accept
you
see
she
went
on
i
invited
to
spend
june
in
five
separate
places
each
one
lovelier
than
the
other
now
i
ca
chop
myself
up
into
five
pieces
you
can
chop
june
up
into
five
pieces
suggested
nan
yes
but
if
i
go
to
a
country
house
to
make
a
good
long
visit
i
want
to
stay
about
a
month
a
week
here
and
then
a
week
there
is
so
unsatisfactory
however
after
much
thoughtful
brooding
over
the
question
i
cut
out
three
and
that
brings
my
quandary
down
to
only
two
places
to
decide
between
lady
hamilton
being
one
observed
her
father
yes
kitty
is
one
and
mabel
hartley
is
the
other
of
course
if
i
spend
june
with
kitty
we
be
right
here
in
london
all
the
time
and
though
i
love
it
yet
i
love
the
country
too
now
if
i
go
to
mabel
i
have
a
beautiful
experience
of
real
english
country
life
you
would
enjoy
it
i
sure
said
nan
and
i
think
you
better
decide
to
go
to
cromarty
manor
and
then
if
for
any
reason
you
like
it
come
back
and
put
in
the
rest
of
your
time
with
lady
kitty
nan
that
an
inspiration
cried
patty
running
across
the
room
and
clasping
nan
in
one
of
her
rather
strenuous
embraces
look
out
you
break
her
cried
fairfield
in
great
pretence
of
fear
no
indeed
said
patty
she
too
substantial
and
anyway
such
a
clever
suggestion
deserves
ample
recognition
patty
sat
on
the
arm
of
nan
chair
and
amused
herself
by
twisting
curly
hair
into
tight
little
spirals
stop
that
patty
said
her
father
you
make
nan
look
like
a
pickaninny
no
matter
what
she
looks
like
if
it
becoming
said
patty
serenely
but
truly
nan
you
ought
to
wear
your
hair
like
that
it
awfully
effective
the
spirals
now
stood
out
all
round
nan
face
like
a
spiky
frame
but
the
victim
only
laughed
as
she
said
never
mind
me
get
these
great
questions
settled
so
after
some
more
talk
and
discussion
it
was
settled
that
patty
should
accept
the
hartleys
urgent
invitation
to
cromarty
manor
for
at
least
a
part
of
june
and
then
if
she
cared
to
stay
also
a
time
with
lady
hamilton
it
may
sound
silly
said
patty
thoughtfully
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
mabel
not
only
wants
me
to
visit
her
this
summer
but
she
needs
me
now
i
do
mean
to
be
conceited
but
do
you
know
you
can
tell
when
people
seem
to
need
you
if
only
in
a
trivial
way
i
understand
said
nan
quickly
and
you
not
conceited
a
bit
patty
mabel
does
need
you
she
is
a
sweet
girl
but
sometimes
she
seems
to
me
the
least
bit
morbid
no
not
quite
that
but
verging
that
way
she
adores
you
and
i
perfectly
sure
that
your
companionship
will
do
her
a
world
of
good
i
hope
so
said
patty
i
love
mabel
but
there
is
something
about
her
i
ca
quite
understand
you
probably
find
out
what
it
is
when
you
staying
with
her
said
her
father
and
i
know
patty
you
do
all
in
your
power
to
brighten
her
up
the
merediths
live
near
them
do
they
yes
only
a
mile
or
two
away
and
the
merediths
are
gay
enough
for
anybody
if
they
at
home
this
summer
there
be
plenty
of
fun
going
on
i
sure
lady
hamilton
will
miss
you
a
lot
said
nan
what
does
she
say
to
your
going
oh
she
says
she
miss
me
said
patty
and
so
she
will
some
but
it
not
like
it
was
when
she
was
here
alone
now
that
she
settled
in
her
father
house
again
she
has
so
much
to
occupy
her
time
and
attention
she
never
lonely
of
course
she
just
as
fond
of
me
and
i
am
of
her
but
since
she
gone
away
from
here
i
do
see
so
much
of
her
and
truly
she
does
need
me
and
mabel
does
so
i
go
to
mabel
first
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
stay
there
until
you
people
come
back
from
your
trip
hartley
asked
me
for
the
whole
summer
you
know
but
you
wo
be
gone
more
than
a
month
or
six
weeks
will
you
not
more
than
two
months
answered
her
father
and
you
know
chickabiddy
if
ever
you
want
to
join
us
i
send
for
you
or
come
for
you
myself
whenever
you
say
the
word
just
telegraph
me
and
respond
at
once
all
right
i
will
if
i
want
to
but
there
too
much
fun
for
me
in
civilization
to
want
to
go
wandering
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
you
may
decide
to
go
to
herenden
hall
for
a
time
yes
i
may
i
love
to
visit
lady
herenden
again
if
i
thought
that
earl
gentleman
would
be
there
he
probably
wo
be
said
nan
i
daresay
you
scared
him
away
from
there
forever
even
so
i
did
scare
him
as
much
as
he
scared
me
returned
patty
but
i
do
hope
there
wo
be
any
earls
at
cromarty
i
like
plain
big
boys
better
those
hartley
boys
are
fine
fellows
observed
fairfield
young
meredith
has
more
fun
and
jollity
but
the
hartleys
are
of
a
sterling
good
sort
i
like
the
whole
family
and
i
glad
patty
girl
that
decided
to
go
there
i
willingly
leave
you
in
hartley
care
and
i
sure
you
have
a
good
time
of
course
i
shall
daddy
and
i
write
you
every
day
if
you
want
me
to
not
quite
so
often
my
dear
twice
a
week
will
be
all
you
find
time
for
i
certain
quite
likely
said
patty
who
was
not
very
fond
of
writing
letters
only
a
week
later
patty
was
to
go
away
with
the
hartleys
and
a
week
was
not
a
very
long
time
for
her
preparations
there
was
shopping
to
do
and
calling
and
as
nan
and
fairfield
were
leaving
at
the
same
time
they
were
to
give
up
their
hotel
apartment
for
the
present
but
lady
hamilton
insisted
that
patty
must
look
upon
sir
otho
big
house
in
carlton
terrace
as
her
own
home
if
she
cared
to
run
up
to
london
for
a
few
days
at
any
time
she
would
be
more
than
welcome
at
lady
kitty
or
she
could
leave
there
any
trunks
or
other
belongings
that
she
wished
this
greatly
pleased
fairfield
for
he
felt
more
comfortable
at
leaving
patty
to
know
that
she
had
a
foothold
in
london
and
somebody
to
look
after
her
should
she
care
to
leave
cromarty
before
her
return
at
last
the
day
of
departure
came
and
fairfield
accompanied
patty
to
the
station
to
meet
the
hartleys
for
the
journey
it
was
with
a
homesick
heart
that
patty
bade
her
father
somehow
she
suddenly
felt
that
she
was
leaving
her
own
people
to
go
away
with
strangers
but
she
knew
she
must
not
be
foolish
so
she
bravely
kept
back
the
tears
and
said
with
a
tender
if
not
a
gay
smile
it
is
the
loveliest
thing
said
mabel
after
they
were
settled
in
the
train
to
think
that
you
really
going
with
us
i
wanted
you
to
so
dreadfully
but
i
did
urge
it
very
much
for
fear
you
would
enjoy
yourself
with
us
i
always
enjoy
myself
said
patty
but
i
know
i
shall
be
happy
with
you
we
try
to
make
you
so
miss
fairfield
said
bob
earnestly
and
patty
smiled
at
him
and
said
then
the
first
thing
you
can
do
toward
it
is
to
drop
that
formal
name
and
call
me
patty
i
not
really
enough
for
the
other
no
i
do
think
you
are
said
bob
as
he
looked
at
her
critically
so
as
we
all
to
live
under
one
roof
for
a
time
we
be
first
namers
all
round
good
said
sinclair
that
suits
me
and
now
mater
when
you
ready
we
go
in
to
luncheon
patty
thought
luncheon
in
the
dining
car
was
great
fun
only
four
could
sit
at
a
table
but
as
hartley
had
a
slight
headache
and
did
not
care
to
talk
she
and
grandma
cromarty
sat
at
another
table
and
left
the
four
young
people
to
chatter
by
themselves
everything
interested
patty
from
the
unusual
things
she
found
on
the
menu
to
the
strange
sights
she
saw
from
the
window
this
was
her
first
trip
in
this
direction
for
they
were
travelling
toward
leicester
and
the
scenes
were
all
new
to
her
the
boys
were
full
of
fun
and
nonsense
and
mabel
was
so
gay
and
jolly
that
patty
began
to
think
she
had
imagined
the
girl
was
of
a
sad
nature
they
all
told
funny
stories
and
made
absurd
jokes
and
poked
fun
at
each
other
and
patty
concluded
she
was
likely
to
have
a
very
jolly
summer
with
the
hartleys
back
they
went
after
luncheon
to
their
funny
parlour
car
which
had
double
seats
facing
each
other
with
a
small
table
between
just
the
place
for
a
game
said
sinclair
as
the
four
took
their
seats
two
on
either
side
of
the
table
what
sort
of
a
game
asked
patty
oh
i
do
know
i
make
one
up
the
boy
took
a
bit
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
and
marked
off
the
table
into
various
sections
with
a
circle
in
each
corner
and
crosses
here
and
there
now
he
explained
as
he
offered
each
player
a
coin
this
is
money
you
know
they
merely
counters
for
the
time
being
but
when
the
game
is
over
you
must
all
give
them
back
to
me
because
they
be
money
again
then
but
what
do
we
do
with
them
asked
patty
who
was
greatly
interested
in
any
game
i
show
you
these
places
are
homes
and
these
are
wilderness
if
you
in
the
wilderness
you
may
be
captured
but
if
you
at
home
you
ca
be
the
game
was
really
a
of
parcheesi
halma
and
some
others
to
which
were
added
some
original
rules
out
of
sinclair
own
head
patty
and
bob
were
partners
against
the
other
two
and
soon
the
quartette
were
deeply
absorbed
in
the
game
you
are
the
cleverest
boy
to
make
this
up
cried
patty
as
her
side
won
and
they
prepared
to
begin
over
again
oh
he
often
makes
up
games
said
mabel
we
all
do
only
are
always
the
best
mine
are
very
good
though
observed
bob
modestly
good
enough
yes
said
sinclair
only
usually
they
so
difficult
that
nobody
can
win
but
yourself
bob
made
a
profound
bow
at
this
compliment
and
then
the
game
went
on
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
had
been
about
five
hours
on
the
train
when
it
was
time
to
get
out
they
had
reached
leicester
and
from
there
were
to
drive
to
cromarty
manor
two
vehicles
met
them
at
the
station
into
one
of
these
a
comfortable
victoria
sinclair
assisted
the
four
ladies
and
in
the
other
the
boys
rode
up
with
the
luggage
the
drive
was
beautiful
and
patty
warmly
expressed
her
gratitude
to
hartley
for
inviting
her
to
this
delightful
experience
of
english
country
life
it
is
beautiful
said
hartley
looking
about
her
i
always
glad
to
get
back
from
london
to
the
restful
quiet
of
these
great
trees
and
the
peaceful
hills
mabel
mood
had
changed
she
no
longer
laughed
and
jested
and
though
sweet
and
gentle
as
ever
the
hint
of
sadness
had
again
crept
into
her
face
and
her
speech
was
slow
and
quiet
patty
adapted
her
mood
to
the
other
and
it
was
almost
in
silence
they
drove
along
the
country
roads
it
was
a
long
ride
and
it
was
nearly
dusk
when
at
last
they
arrived
at
cromarty
manor
an
old
servant
came
out
from
the
porter
lodge
to
open
the
high
iron
gates
for
them
he
gave
them
a
warm
greeting
which
seemed
a
welcome
and
not
merely
the
speech
of
a
paid
dependant
and
then
they
drove
on
toward
the
house
the
whole
effect
was
so
beautiful
that
it
almost
took
patty
breath
away
it
was
not
a
bit
like
herenden
hall
it
was
more
like
an
old
feudal
castle
the
picturesque
house
was
of
gray
stone
with
towers
and
turrets
almost
entirely
covered
with
ivy
from
the
ivy
the
birds
flew
in
and
out
and
the
darkness
of
the
surrounding
trees
and
tall
shrubbery
gave
the
place
a
weird
and
fairly
mysterious
appearance
you
feel
the
charm
of
it
do
you
said
hartley
kindly
as
she
looked
at
patty
rapt
face
and
serious
eyes
yes
indeed
said
patty
softly
i
ca
explain
it
but
it
casts
a
spell
over
me
oh
i
do
wonder
you
love
it
but
the
darkness
of
the
outer
world
was
soon
dispelled
by
a
broad
gleam
of
light
as
the
great
front
doors
were
thrown
open
an
old
butler
stood
on
the
threshold
and
greeted
them
with
rather
pompous
respect
and
punctilious
deference
the
interior
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
outside
view
of
the
house
but
though
the
old
carved
rafters
and
wainscoting
were
dark
and
heavy
cheerful
lamps
were
in
abundance
and
in
the
halls
and
wax
candles
were
lighted
also
at
the
first
view
on
entering
there
seemed
to
be
an
interminable
vista
of
rooms
that
opened
one
from
another
this
was
partly
the
effect
of
the
elaborate
old
architecture
and
partly
because
of
many
long
mirrors
in
various
positions
the
furniture
tapestries
and
ornaments
were
all
of
an
epoch
two
centuries
back
and
the
whole
picture
fascinated
patty
beyond
all
words
it
a
wonderful
place
she
said
at
last
and
after
a
week
or
two
going
to
examine
it
in
detail
but
at
first
i
shall
be
satisfied
just
to
bask
in
its
atmosphere
you
do
cried
bob
who
had
just
arrived
if
you
had
appreciated
cromarty
we
were
going
to
pack
you
straight
back
to
london
but
acquitted
yourself
nobly
nobody
could
make
a
better
speech
than
you
did
and
i
wager
you
did
learn
it
beforehand
either
i
could
said
patty
because
i
did
know
what
the
place
was
like
what
few
remarks
you
made
about
it
seem
like
nothing
now
that
i
begun
to
see
it
for
myself
yes
and
you
only
begun
said
sinclair
when
you
get
further
into
the
heart
of
it
you
surrender
to
its
charm
as
we
all
do
i
sure
i
shall
agreed
patty
and
indeed
i
think
i
have
already
done
so
chapter
xiii
cromarty
manor
life
at
cromarty
manor
was
very
pleasant
indeed
although
patty
had
not
definitely
realised
it
she
was
thoroughly
tired
out
by
her
london
gaieties
and
the
peaceful
quiet
of
the
country
brought
her
a
rest
that
she
truly
needed
also
the
hartleys
were
a
delightful
family
to
visit
there
is
quite
as
much
hospitality
in
knowing
when
to
leave
guests
to
themselves
as
there
is
in
continually
entertaining
them
and
while
the
hartleys
planned
many
pleasures
for
patty
yet
there
were
also
hours
in
the
morning
or
early
afternoon
when
she
was
free
to
follow
her
own
sweet
will
sometimes
she
would
roam
around
the
historic
old
house
pausing
here
and
there
in
some
of
the
silent
unused
rooms
to
imagine
romances
of
days
gone
by
sometimes
she
would
stroll
through
the
orchards
and
woods
by
ravines
and
brooks
always
discovering
some
new
and
beautiful
vista
or
bit
of
scenery
and
often
she
would
spend
a
morning
lying
in
a
hammock
beneath
the
old
trees
reading
a
book
or
merely
as
she
watched
the
sunlight
play
among
the
leaves
above
her
head
one
morning
after
she
had
been
at
cromarty
manor
for
about
a
week
patty
betook
herself
to
her
favourite
hammock
carrying
with
her
a
book
of
fairy
tales
for
which
she
had
never
outgrown
her
childish
fondness
but
the
book
remained
unopened
for
patty
mind
was
full
of
busy
thoughts
she
looked
around
at
the
beautiful
landscape
which
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
included
only
the
land
belonging
to
the
cromarty
estate
there
were
more
than
a
thousand
acres
in
all
much
of
which
was
cultivated
ground
and
the
rest
woodland
or
rolling
meadows
patty
looked
at
the
dark
woods
in
the
distance
the
orchards
nearer
by
and
in
her
immediate
vicinity
the
beautiful
gardens
and
terraces
the
latter
of
which
there
were
two
known
as
the
upper
and
lower
terrace
were
two
hundred
feet
long
and
were
separated
by
a
sloping
bank
of
green
lawn
dotted
with
round
flower
beds
illustration
often
she
would
spend
a
morning
lying
in
a
hammock
beneath
the
old
trees
above
the
terraces
rose
the
old
house
itself
the
manor
was
built
of
a
grayish
stone
and
was
of
elizabethan
architecture
more
than
two
hundred
years
old
it
had
been
remodelled
and
added
to
by
its
various
successive
owners
but
much
of
its
fine
old
original
plan
was
left
ivy
clung
to
its
walls
and
birds
fluttered
in
and
out
continually
there
was
a
tower
on
either
side
the
great
entrance
and
patty
loved
to
fancy
that
awful
and
mysterious
deeds
had
been
committed
within
those
frowning
walls
but
there
was
no
legend
or
tradition
attached
to
the
mansion
and
all
its
history
seemed
to
be
peaceful
and
pleasant
even
the
quaint
old
walk
with
its
strangely
misshapen
shrubbery
was
bright
and
cheerful
in
the
morning
sunlight
and
the
lake
rippled
like
silver
and
gave
no
hint
of
dark
or
gloomy
depths
and
yet
patty
could
help
feeling
that
there
was
some
shadow
hanging
over
the
hartley
family
they
were
never
sad
or
but
sometimes
hartley
would
sigh
or
grandma
cromarty
would
look
anxious
as
if
at
some
unrelievable
sorrow
the
boys
were
always
and
gay
but
mabel
often
had
moods
of
despondency
which
while
they
never
made
her
cross
or
irritable
were
so
pathetic
that
it
worried
patty
loving
heart
and
so
she
lay
in
her
hammock
gazing
at
the
beauty
all
about
her
and
wondering
what
was
the
secret
grief
that
harassed
her
dear
friends
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
none
of
her
affair
for
patty
was
possessed
of
a
healthy
curiosity
and
moreover
she
was
innately
of
a
helpful
nature
and
longed
to
know
what
the
trouble
was
in
a
vague
hope
that
she
might
be
of
some
assistance
i
know
they
not
rich
she
said
to
herself
for
the
whole
place
shows
neglect
and
shabbiness
but
there
something
besides
lack
of
money
that
makes
madam
cromarty
sad
the
place
was
indeed
in
a
state
of
unrepair
though
there
were
many
servants
there
were
not
enough
to
do
all
that
should
have
been
done
the
two
gardeners
did
their
best
to
keep
the
flowers
in
order
but
the
elaborate
conventional
gardens
laid
out
in
geometric
designs
and
intricate
paths
called
for
a
complete
staff
of
trained
workers
and
in
the
absence
of
these
became
overgrown
at
their
borders
and
untidy
in
appearance
it
was
the
same
indoors
the
handsome
old
furniture
covered
with
silk
brocades
and
tapestries
was
worn
and
sometimes
ragged
in
appearance
some
of
the
decorations
showed
need
of
regilding
and
though
the
magnificent
old
carved
woodwork
and
tessellated
floors
could
not
be
marred
by
time
yet
many
of
the
lesser
appointments
called
for
renovation
or
renewal
the
great
hall
as
it
was
called
had
best
withstood
the
ravages
of
time
as
it
was
wainscoted
and
ceiled
in
massive
old
oak
it
was
a
noble
apartment
with
recessed
windows
and
panelled
walls
and
across
one
end
was
a
raised
platform
from
the
back
of
which
rose
a
wonderfully
carved
this
apartment
in
the
palmier
days
of
the
manor
house
had
been
the
banqueting
hall
but
as
there
was
a
smaller
and
more
appropriate
the
hartleys
used
the
great
hall
as
a
living
room
and
had
gathered
in
it
their
dearest
treasures
and
belongings
grandma
cromarty
had
her
own
corner
with
her
knitting
basket
in
another
corner
was
a
grand
piano
and
many
other
musical
instruments
in
one
north
bay
window
was
mabel
painting
outfit
and
so
large
was
the
recess
that
it
formed
a
studio
on
the
walls
hobnobbing
with
the
ancient
antlers
and
deers
heads
trophies
of
the
chase
were
the
boys
tennis
rackets
and
in
the
outstretched
arm
of
a
tall
figure
in
armour
a
lot
of
golfsticks
rested
against
the
quartered
shield
i
suppose
mabel
had
said
when
they
first
showed
this
room
to
patty
a
great
many
people
would
consider
it
desecration
to
fill
up
this
fine
old
place
with
all
our
modern
stuff
but
we
modern
and
so
we
make
the
carving
and
tapestries
give
way
to
us
they
like
it
patty
had
replied
they
feel
sorry
for
other
houses
where
the
carvings
and
tapestries
have
to
stay
back
in
their
own
old
times
now
hear
these
old
rafters
ring
to
modern
music
and
seating
herself
at
the
piano
patty
began
some
rollicking
songs
that
were
of
decidedly
later
date
than
the
old
rafters
opening
from
the
old
banqueting
hall
was
the
library
this
had
been
left
just
as
it
was
and
the
shelves
full
of
old
books
were
a
delight
to
patty
browsing
nature
a
gallery
ran
round
all
four
sides
which
was
reached
by
spiral
iron
staircases
and
the
windows
with
their
old
leather
cushions
made
delightful
nooks
in
which
to
pore
over
the
old
volumes
there
were
many
unused
rooms
in
the
manor
house
many
unexpected
alcoves
and
corridors
and
in
these
the
old
furniture
was
worn
and
decayed
the
rooms
that
were
lived
in
were
kept
in
comfortable
order
but
patty
knew
had
there
been
more
these
other
apartments
would
have
been
thrown
open
to
light
and
air
surely
patty
decided
the
hartleys
were
pinched
for
money
but
just
as
surely
she
thought
that
could
not
have
the
effect
of
casting
that
indefinite
gloom
over
them
which
was
now
and
then
observable
and
as
she
idly
swung
in
her
hammock
she
made
up
her
mind
to
ask
about
it
if
they
do
want
to
tell
me
they
need
she
said
to
herself
but
they
surely
know
me
well
enough
now
to
know
that
i
honestly
interested
in
their
life
and
not
merely
trying
to
pry
into
their
secrets
but
she
could
not
quite
decide
which
one
of
the
family
to
ask
about
it
she
would
have
preferred
to
ask
grandma
cromarty
but
the
old
lady
had
a
certain
reserve
which
at
times
was
forbidding
and
patty
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
her
hartley
was
kindly
and
responsive
but
patty
rarely
saw
her
except
when
the
whole
family
was
present
in
the
morning
hartley
was
busy
with
household
duties
and
afternoons
patty
and
mabel
were
usually
together
patty
felt
sure
she
could
never
ask
mabel
for
though
the
two
girls
were
confidential
friends
there
was
a
sensitiveness
in
disposition
that
made
patty
shrink
from
touching
on
what
she
felt
might
be
a
painful
subject
then
there
were
the
boys
bob
at
home
on
his
vacation
from
college
was
patty
chum
and
merry
comrade
but
she
imagined
he
would
cleverly
evade
a
serious
question
he
was
always
chaffing
and
while
patty
was
always
glad
to
meet
him
on
this
ground
she
almost
knew
he
would
talk
seriously
on
family
subjects
this
left
only
sinclair
patty
really
liked
sinclair
hartley
a
young
man
of
about
twenty
he
was
studying
law
in
a
nearby
town
where
he
went
every
morning
returning
in
he
was
kindly
and
courteous
and
though
often
grave
was
always
appreciative
of
a
joke
and
quite
ready
to
join
in
any
fun
but
he
had
a
serious
side
and
patty
had
enjoyed
many
long
talks
with
him
on
subjects
that
never
would
interest
mabel
or
bob
and
so
she
concluded
that
at
the
first
opportunity
she
would
ask
sinclair
what
was
the
nature
of
the
mystery
that
seemed
to
hang
over
the
house
of
hartley
ah
there
called
a
gay
voice
and
looking
around
patty
saw
bob
strolling
toward
her
across
the
lawn
want
to
go
out
on
the
lake
and
fish
for
yes
indeed
said
patty
twisting
herself
out
of
the
hammock
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
oh
just
for
the
lunch
table
mabel
so
everlastingly
fond
of
them
you
know
patty
thought
it
was
nice
of
bob
to
remember
his
sister
tastes
and
she
willingly
went
with
him
toward
the
lake
how
beautiful
it
all
is
she
said
as
they
went
down
the
terrace
steps
and
along
the
lake
path
which
led
through
a
pergola
and
around
a
curved
corner
called
the
alcove
this
delightful
nook
was
a
small
open
court
of
marble
adorned
with
pillars
and
statues
and
partly
surrounding
a
fountain
yes
is
it
exclaimed
bob
enthusiastically
you
know
patty
this
old
place
is
my
joy
and
my
despair
i
love
every
stick
and
stone
of
it
but
i
wish
we
could
keep
it
up
in
decent
order
just
wait
until
i
out
of
college
i
do
something
then
to
turn
an
honest
shilling
and
every
penny
of
it
shall
go
to
fix
up
the
dear
old
place
what
are
you
going
to
be
bob
an
engineer
there
more
chance
for
a
fellow
in
that
than
in
any
other
profession
old
sinclair
for
being
a
lawyer
and
he
be
a
good
one
too
but
it
slow
work
you
ought
to
go
to
america
bob
if
you
want
to
get
rich
i
would
like
a
shot
if
i
could
take
the
old
house
with
me
but
afraid
it
too
big
to
uproot
i
afraid
it
is
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
live
in
a
front
on
fifth
avenue
never
having
seen
your
avenue
i
ca
say
but
i
suppose
a
deer
park
and
lake
and
several
thousand
acres
of
meadow
land
are
not
included
with
each
house
no
not
unless
you
take
the
whole
of
manhattan
island
even
that
would
do
unless
i
had
taken
it
a
few
hundred
years
ago
and
started
the
trees
growing
then
no
america
would
suit
you
said
patty
thoughtfully
any
more
than
english
country
life
would
suit
most
of
our
american
boys
but
you
like
this
life
of
ours
i
love
it
for
a
time
and
just
now
i
am
enjoying
it
immensely
oh
what
gorgeous
lilies
they
had
reached
the
lake
and
the
quiet
water
was
placidly
rippling
against
the
stone
coping
bob
untied
the
boat
it
an
old
thing
he
said
regretfully
but
it
so
do
be
afraid
patty
went
down
the
broad
marble
steps
and
seated
herself
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
while
bob
took
the
rowing
seat
a
few
of
his
strong
pulls
and
they
were
out
among
the
lily
pads
row
around
a
bit
before
we
gather
them
suggested
patty
and
bob
with
long
slow
strokes
sent
the
boat
softly
and
steadily
along
is
it
perfect
said
patty
dreamily
it
seems
as
if
nothing
could
stir
me
up
on
a
day
like
this
is
that
so
said
bob
and
with
mischief
in
his
eyes
he
began
to
rock
the
boat
from
side
to
side
you
villain
cried
patty
rudely
stirred
from
her
calm
enjoyment
take
that
she
dashed
light
sprays
of
water
at
him
from
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
he
returned
by
cleverly
sprinkling
a
few
drops
on
her
from
the
blade
of
his
oar
why
did
you
want
to
kick
up
a
bobbery
when
everything
was
so
nice
and
peaceful
she
said
reproachfully
i
shall
always
kick
up
a
bobbery
he
returned
calmly
when
you
put
on
that
romantic
sentimental
air
i
did
put
on
any
sentimental
air
i
was
just
enjoying
the
dreamy
spirit
of
the
lake
thank
you
that
the
same
as
saying
my
society
makes
you
sleepy
nothing
of
the
sort
and
anyway
the
dreamy
mood
has
passed
yes
i
intended
it
should
now
let
sing
all
right
what
the
kibosh
i
think
that
a
good
song
to
row
by
the
young
people
at
cromarty
manor
had
already
composed
several
songs
which
seemed
to
them
choicest
gems
of
musical
composition
as
a
rule
patty
and
bob
made
up
the
words
while
mabel
and
sinclair
arranged
the
tunes
sometimes
the
airs
were
adapted
from
songs
and
sometimes
they
were
entirely
original
the
little
kibosh
was
one
of
their
favourite
nonsense
songs
and
now
patty
and
bob
sang
it
in
unison
as
they
rowed
slowly
about
on
the
lake
it
was
ever
so
many
years
ago
on
a
prairie
by
the
sea
a
little
kibosh
i
used
to
know
by
the
name
of
hoppity
lee
his
hair
was
as
green
as
the
driven
snow
and
his
cheeks
were
as
blue
as
tea
was
just
about
night
or
nearly
noon
when
hoppity
lee
and
i
decided
to
go
for
a
sail
to
the
moon
at
least
as
far
as
the
sky
but
instead
of
taking
the
big
balloon
sailed
in
a
pumpkin
pie
dear
little
hoppity
lee
and
i
were
happy
and
glad
and
gay
but
the
dog
star
came
out
as
we
passed
by
and
began
to
bark
and
bay
and
the
little
kibosh
fell
out
of
the
pie
and
into
the
milky
way
i
fished
and
fished
for
a
year
and
a
week
for
dear
little
hoppity
lee
and
at
last
i
heard
a
small
faint
squeak
from
the
place
where
he
used
to
be
and
he
said
home
and
never
more
seek
oh
never
more
seek
for
me
chapter
xiv
uncle
marmaduke
that
very
same
evening
patty
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
sinclair
alone
it
was
just
after
dinner
and
the
lovely
english
twilight
was
beginning
to
cast
long
soft
shadows
of
the
tall
cypresses
across
the
lawn
the
various
members
of
the
family
were
standing
about
on
the
terrace
when
sinclair
said
you
need
some
exercise
patty
let
walk
as
far
as
the
alcove
patty
assented
and
the
two
strolled
away
while
mabel
called
after
them
do
be
gone
long
for
we
all
going
to
play
games
this
evening
they
all
loved
games
so
patty
promised
to
return
very
soon
i
never
saw
anything
like
this
alcove
before
in
my
life
said
patty
as
they
reached
the
picturesque
spot
and
sat
down
upon
the
curving
marble
seat
they
are
often
found
in
the
gardens
of
old
english
homes
any
arched
or
covered
seat
out
of
doors
is
called
an
alcove
but
this
is
rather
an
elaborate
one
the
marble
pillars
are
of
fine
design
and
the
whole
thing
is
beautifully
proportioned
is
it
very
old
yes
older
than
the
house
you
know
the
cromartys
have
lived
on
this
estate
for
several
hundred
years
but
the
original
house
was
destroyed
by
fire
or
nearly
so
and
the
present
house
was
built
on
the
old
foundations
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
if
interested
in
these
things
there
are
lots
of
books
in
the
library
telling
all
about
the
history
of
the
place
indeed
i
am
interested
and
i
shall
look
up
the
books
if
you
tell
me
what
they
are
is
there
any
legend
or
tradition
connected
with
the
place
no
we
have
no
ghosts
at
cromarty
manor
we
always
been
a
peaceful
sort
except
that
my
great
uncle
quarrelled
with
my
grandfather
cromarty
husband
yes
he
was
roger
cromarty
grandfather
was
i
mean
and
he
had
a
brother
marmaduke
they
were
both
and
marmaduke
after
an
unusually
fierce
quarrel
left
home
and
went
to
india
but
have
you
never
heard
the
story
of
the
cromarty
fortune
no
i
never
have
is
it
a
sad
story
would
you
rather
not
tell
me
why
no
it
is
a
sad
story
except
that
the
conditions
are
rather
sad
for
us
but
there
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
hear
it
if
you
care
to
indeed
i
supposed
mabel
had
already
told
it
you
no
she
never
did
will
you
yes
but
not
here
let
us
go
in
and
get
the
family
all
together
and
we
give
you
a
dramatic
recital
of
the
great
cromarty
mystery
oh
is
it
a
mystery
story
how
delightful
i
love
a
mystery
i
glad
you
do
but
i
assure
you
i
wish
it
was
a
mystery
will
it
never
be
solved
i
fear
not
now
but
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
and
tell
the
tale
as
it
should
be
told
they
found
that
the
others
had
already
gone
into
the
house
and
were
gathered
round
the
big
table
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
living
room
as
they
joined
the
group
sinclair
said
before
we
play
games
this
evening
we
are
going
to
tell
patty
the
story
of
uncle
marmaduke
money
patty
was
surprised
to
note
the
different
expressions
on
her
faces
mabel
seemed
to
shrink
into
herself
as
if
in
embarrassment
or
sensitiveness
cromarty
looked
calmly
proud
and
hartley
smiled
a
little
but
bob
laughed
outright
and
said
good
i
help
we
all
help
and
we
touch
up
the
tale
until
it
has
all
the
dramatic
effect
of
a
novel
it
wo
need
touching
up
said
sinclair
just
the
plain
truth
is
story
enough
of
itself
you
begin
it
grandy
said
bob
and
then
when
your
imagination
gives
out
i
take
a
hand
at
it
the
old
lady
smiled
it
needs
no
imagination
robert
she
said
if
patty
cares
to
hear
of
our
family
misfortune
i
quite
willing
to
relate
the
tale
oh
i
did
know
it
was
a
misfortune
cried
patty
i
thought
it
was
a
mystery
story
it
both
said
cromarty
but
if
the
mystery
could
be
solved
it
would
be
no
misfortune
that
sounds
like
an
enigma
observed
patty
it
all
an
enigma
said
bob
go
ahead
grandy
the
story
begins
said
cromarty
with
my
marriage
to
roger
cromarty
i
was
wed
in
the
year
my
husband
and
i
were
happy
during
the
first
few
years
of
our
married
life
he
was
the
owner
of
this
beautiful
place
which
had
been
in
his
family
for
many
generations
my
daughter
emmeline
was
born
here
and
when
she
was
a
child
she
filled
the
old
house
with
her
happy
laughter
and
chatter
my
husband
had
a
brother
marmaduke
with
whom
he
was
not
on
good
terms
before
my
marriage
this
brother
had
left
home
and
gone
to
india
my
husband
held
no
communication
with
him
but
we
sometimes
heard
indirectly
from
him
and
reports
always
said
that
he
was
amassing
great
wealth
in
some
indian
commerce
is
that
his
portrait
asked
patty
indicating
a
painting
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
yes
said
cromarty
but
the
picture
represents
him
as
looking
amiable
whereas
he
was
always
cross
grumpy
and
irritable
like
me
commented
bob
no
said
his
mother
i
thankful
to
say
that
none
of
you
children
show
the
slightest
signs
of
uncle
marmaduke
disposition
i
was
only
fifteen
years
old
when
he
died
but
i
shall
never
forget
his
scowling
face
and
angry
tones
was
he
always
cross
asked
patty
amazed
that
any
one
could
be
invariably
always
said
cromarty
at
least
whenever
he
was
here
i
never
saw
him
elsewhere
go
back
grandy
you
getting
ahead
of
your
story
well
i
tried
my
best
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
the
two
brothers
but
both
were
proud
and
a
bit
stubborn
i
could
not
persuade
my
husband
to
write
to
marmaduke
and
though
i
wrote
to
him
myself
my
letters
were
torn
up
and
the
scraps
returned
to
me
lovely
old
gentleman
commented
bob
i
glad
my
manners
are
at
least
better
than
that
at
last
my
husband
roger
cromarty
became
very
ill
i
knew
he
could
not
recover
and
wrote
marmaduke
to
that
effect
to
my
surprise
i
received
a
grim
but
fairly
polite
letter
saying
that
he
would
leave
india
at
once
and
hoped
to
reach
his
brother
bedside
in
time
for
a
reconciliation
and
did
he
asked
patty
breathlessly
yes
but
that
was
all
my
husband
was
dying
when
his
brother
came
they
made
peace
however
and
arranged
some
business
matters
oh
cried
patty
how
glad
you
must
have
been
that
he
did
not
come
too
late
what
a
comfort
all
these
years
to
know
that
they
did
make
up
their
quarrel
yes
indeed
assented
cromarty
but
i
have
talked
all
i
can
emmeline
you
may
take
up
the
narrative
i
tell
a
little
said
hartley
smiling
but
i
shall
soon
let
sinclair
continue
we
all
know
this
tale
by
heart
but
only
sinclair
can
do
full
justice
to
the
mysterious
part
of
it
i
was
only
ten
years
old
when
my
father
died
and
uncle
marmaduke
came
here
to
live
it
changed
the
whole
world
for
me
where
before
all
had
been
happiness
and
love
now
all
was
unkindness
and
fear
none
of
us
dared
cross
uncle
marmaduke
for
his
fiery
anger
was
something
not
to
be
endured
and
beside
being
he
was
erratic
he
did
most
peculiar
things
without
any
reason
in
them
whatever
altogether
he
was
a
most
difficult
man
to
live
with
but
at
my
father
death
he
owned
this
estate
and
we
had
to
live
with
him
or
go
homeless
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
he
repaired
and
restored
much
about
the
place
but
even
in
this
he
was
erratic
he
would
have
masons
in
to
renew
the
crumbling
plaster
and
brickwork
in
the
cellars
while
the
furniture
could
go
ragged
and
forlorn
he
spent
his
money
freely
for
anything
he
wanted
himself
but
was
niggardly
toward
mother
and
myself
however
he
always
told
us
that
at
his
death
we
should
inherit
his
wealth
the
estate
also
he
willed
to
mother
he
lived
with
us
for
about
five
years
and
then
was
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
i
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
then
and
when
he
was
brought
in
mangled
and
almost
dead
he
called
for
me
i
went
to
his
bedside
trembling
for
even
then
i
feared
he
was
going
to
scold
me
but
he
could
only
speak
in
hesitating
disjointed
sentences
it
was
with
difficulty
i
gathered
that
he
was
trying
to
give
me
some
information
about
his
fortune
i
wish
now
i
had
tried
to
help
him
tell
me
but
at
that
time
it
seemed
heartless
to
think
of
such
things
when
the
poor
man
was
dying
and
i
soothed
him
and
begged
him
not
to
try
to
talk
when
it
was
such
an
exertion
oh
mother
wailed
bob
if
you
only
listened
instead
of
talking
yourself
hartley
smiled
as
if
she
were
used
to
such
comments
at
this
part
of
the
story
well
she
said
i
think
sinclair
may
take
up
the
recital
here
that
is
if
you
interested
patty
if
i
interested
indeed
i
am
it
very
exciting
and
i
want
it
all
now
no
in
our
next
we
do
know
the
end
ourselves
said
mabel
with
such
a
wistful
look
in
her
eyes
that
patty
went
over
and
sat
by
her
and
with
her
arm
round
her
listened
to
the
rest
of
the
story
well
then
said
sinclair
in
his
grave
kindly
voice
uncle
marmaduke
tried
very
hard
to
communicate
to
mother
and
grandy
something
about
his
fortune
but
his
accident
had
somehow
paralysed
his
throat
and
he
could
scarcely
articulate
but
for
an
hour
or
more
as
he
lay
dying
he
would
look
at
them
with
piercing
glances
and
say
what
sounded
like
dickens
gold
did
he
mean
gold
money
asked
patty
impulsively
they
did
know
then
but
they
thought
at
the
time
that
dickens
was
one
of
his
angry
expletives
as
he
was
given
to
such
language
the
gold
they
felt
sure
referred
to
his
fortune
which
he
had
always
declared
he
would
leave
to
grandmother
then
he
died
without
being
able
to
say
any
other
except
those
two
words
gold
and
dickens
he
might
have
meant
charles
dickens
suggested
patty
who
dearly
loved
to
guess
at
a
puzzle
as
it
turned
out
he
did
said
sinclair
serenely
but
that
ahead
of
the
story
and
too
said
hartley
the
way
in
which
he
finally
articulated
the
word
by
a
great
effort
and
after
many
attempts
was
so
so
explosive
that
it
sounded
like
an
ejaculation
far
more
than
like
a
noted
author
years
went
by
continued
sinclair
and
grandy
and
mother
were
left
with
the
old
cromarty
estate
and
nothing
to
keep
it
up
with
we
had
a
small
income
my
boy
said
his
grandmother
yes
but
not
enough
to
keep
the
place
as
it
should
be
kept
however
no
trace
could
be
found
of
uncle
marmaduke
money
he
was
generally
supposed
to
have
brought
a
large
fortune
home
from
india
but
it
seemed
to
have
vanished
into
thin
air
his
private
papers
and
belongings
showed
no
records
of
stocks
or
bonds
no
bank
books
and
save
for
a
small
amount
of
ready
money
he
had
by
him
he
seemed
to
be
penniless
of
course
he
was
the
way
he
had
lived
and
the
money
he
had
spent
indicated
that
he
had
a
fortune
somewhere
and
too
there
was
his
promise
to
leave
it
to
grandy
of
course
the
conclusion
was
that
he
had
hidden
this
fortune
a
hidden
fortune
exclaimed
patty
blissfully
oh
what
a
lovely
mystery
why
you
could
have
a
better
one
i
think
a
discovered
fortune
would
be
far
better
said
mabel
and
patty
clasped
her
friend
hand
in
sympathy
at
last
said
sinclair
a
bright
lawyer
had
a
glimmering
of
an
idea
that
uncle
marmaduke
last
words
had
some
meaning
to
them
he
inquired
of
the
ladies
of
the
house
and
learned
that
the
late
marmaduke
had
been
exceedingly
fond
of
reading
dickens
and
that
he
was
greatly
attached
to
his
own
set
of
the
great
author
works
ha
said
the
very
bright
lawyer
those
pages
we
will
find
many
bank
of
england
notes
or
certificates
of
valuable
stocks
they
flew
to
the
library
and
thoroughly
searched
all
the
volumes
of
the
set
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
nothing
said
patty
wagging
her
head
solemnly
exactly
that
save
for
a
here
and
there
the
volumes
held
nothing
but
their
own
immortal
stories
again
hissed
the
bright
lawyer
but
he
kept
right
on
being
foiled
and
still
no
hoard
of
securities
was
found
but
what
about
the
gold
said
patty
they
did
expect
to
find
gold
coins
in
dickens
books
no
but
they
fondly
hoped
they
find
a
mysterious
paper
in
cryptogram
like
the
bug
you
know
telling
them
to
go
out
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
dig
north
by
northwest
under
the
old
apple
tree
do
try
to
be
funny
clair
put
in
bob
go
on
with
the
yarn
telling
it
well
and
then
said
sinclair
looking
from
one
to
another
of
his
interested
hearers
and
then
the
years
rolled
by
until
the
fair
maiden
emmeline
cromarty
was
of
sufficient
age
to
have
suitors
for
her
hand
as
we
can
well
believe
after
a
mere
glance
in
her
direction
she
was
the
belle
of
the
whole
countryside
brave
gallants
from
far
and
near
came
galloping
into
the
courtyard
and
dismounting
in
feverish
haste
cried
ho
is
the
radiant
emmeline
within
then
the
old
warden
with
his
clanking
keys
admitted
them
and
they
stood
in
rows
that
the
coquettish
damsel
might
make
a
selection
how
ridiculous
you
are
sinclair
said
his
mother
smiling
ca
you
omit
that
part
nay
nay
fair
lady
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
among
the
shoals
of
suitors
was
one
who
was
far
more
brave
and
strong
and
noble
than
all
the
rest
edgar
hartley
sinclair
voice
broke
a
little
as
he
spoke
the
name
of
his
revered
father
but
hiding
his
emotion
he
went
on
edgar
hartley
wooed
and
won
emmeline
cromarty
and
in
the
beautiful
june
of
they
were
wed
and
merrily
rang
the
bells
now
while
edgar
hartley
was
by
no
means
wealthy
he
had
a
fair
income
and
the
fortunes
of
cromarty
manor
improved
the
young
couple
took
up
their
abode
here
and
the
dowager
duchess
of
cromarty
lived
with
them
i
not
a
duchess
interposed
cromarty
in
her
calm
way
you
ought
to
have
been
grandy
declared
bob
you
look
the
part
and
i
sure
there
a
missing
title
somewhere
that
belongs
to
you
perhaps
uncle
marmaduke
concealed
it
with
the
rest
of
his
fortune
no
dear
boy
we
are
not
titled
people
but
the
cromartys
are
an
old
family
and
much
beloved
and
respected
by
all
the
country
round
we
are
so
declared
bob
with
great
enthusiasm
chapter
xv
puzzling
rhymes
as
i
was
saying
continued
sinclair
and
hartley
lived
happily
at
cromarty
manor
three
beautiful
children
were
born
to
them
who
have
since
grown
to
be
the
superior
specimens
of
humanity
you
see
before
you
i
am
the
oldest
and
as
i
may
modestly
remark
the
flower
of
the
family
oh
i
do
know
commented
patty
looking
affectionately
at
mabel
well
anyway
as
was
only
natural
the
search
for
that
hidden
fortune
went
on
at
times
perhaps
a
visitor
would
stir
up
the
interest
afresh
and
attempts
would
be
made
to
discover
new
meaning
in
uncle
last
words
and
it
was
my
father
who
succeeded
in
doing
this
he
sat
in
the
library
one
day
looking
over
the
old
set
of
dickens
works
which
always
had
a
fascinating
air
of
holding
the
secret
he
had
not
lived
here
long
then
and
was
not
very
familiar
with
the
books
on
the
library
shelves
but
looking
about
he
discovered
another
set
of
dickens
a
much
newer
set
and
the
volumes
were
bound
in
cloth
but
almost
entirely
covered
by
a
gilded
decoration
wait
i
show
you
one
sinclair
rose
and
going
into
the
library
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
copy
of
barnaby
rudge
it
was
bound
in
green
cloth
but
so
ornate
was
the
gold
tooling
that
little
green
could
be
seen
dickens
gold
murmured
patty
her
eyes
shining
as
she
realised
the
new
meaning
in
the
words
yes
and
sure
enough
that
was
what
uncle
marmaduke
meant
just
think
for
fifteen
years
that
set
of
books
had
stood
untouched
on
the
shelves
while
people
nearly
wore
out
the
older
set
hunting
for
a
clue
to
the
fortune
it
great
declared
patty
go
on
well
this
set
of
dickens
proved
extremely
interesting
between
the
leaves
of
the
books
were
papers
of
all
sorts
bills
deeds
banknotes
memoranda
and
even
a
will
then
you
had
the
fortune
at
last
no
such
luck
the
banknotes
and
the
few
securities
in
the
books
amounted
to
a
fair
sum
which
was
gratefully
appreciated
by
my
parents
but
as
to
the
bulk
of
the
fortune
it
only
made
matters
more
tantalising
than
ever
why
asked
patty
one
of
the
papers
was
a
will
properly
executed
and
witnessed
leaving
all
the
fortune
of
which
uncle
marmaduke
died
possessed
to
my
mother
then
instead
of
a
definite
statement
of
where
this
money
was
deposited
were
some
foolish
jingles
hinting
where
to
find
it
these
rhymes
would
be
interesting
as
an
old
legend
or
in
a
story
book
but
to
find
them
instead
of
a
heap
of
money
was
to
say
the
least
disappointing
and
did
you
never
find
the
money
never
and
of
course
now
we
never
will
remember
all
this
happened
twenty
years
ago
i
mean
the
discovery
of
the
papers
of
course
the
money
was
hidden
more
than
years
ago
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
people
are
living
here
in
your
own
house
and
your
own
money
is
hidden
here
somewhere
and
you
ca
find
it
exactly
as
you
state
it
well
find
it
if
i
had
to
tear
the
whole
house
down
wait
a
minute
miss
impetuosity
we
do
think
it
in
the
house
oh
out
of
doors
you
good
at
puzzles
i
know
but
just
wait
until
you
hear
the
directions
that
came
with
the
package
and
i
think
you
admit
it
a
hopeless
problem
may
she
see
them
mother
said
mabel
will
you
get
them
out
for
us
not
dear
i
show
the
old
papers
to
patty
some
other
time
but
now
sinclair
can
tell
her
the
lines
just
as
well
of
all
the
papers
in
the
books
sinclair
went
on
only
two
seemed
to
be
directions
for
finding
the
money
although
others
vaguely
hinted
that
the
fortune
was
concealed
and
still
others
gave
the
impression
that
uncle
marmaduke
meant
to
tell
mother
all
about
it
but
as
his
death
came
upon
him
so
suddenly
of
course
he
could
not
do
this
on
these
two
papers
are
rhymes
which
we
children
have
known
by
heart
all
our
lives
one
is
treasure
lieth
in
the
poke
between
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
you
see
uncle
was
a
true
poet
what
does
the
poke
mean
asked
patty
oh
a
poke
is
a
pocket
or
a
of
any
sort
of
course
this
information
sent
father
to
digging
around
every
fir
tree
and
oak
tree
on
the
place
as
you
know
there
are
hundreds
of
both
kinds
of
trees
so
the
directions
ca
be
called
explicit
but
said
patty
wrinkling
her
brow
it
says
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
as
if
it
meant
a
clump
of
firs
and
only
one
big
oak
yes
that
what
has
been
surmised
and
many
a
separate
oak
tree
that
stands
near
a
group
of
firs
has
been
thoroughly
investigated
but
wait
there
another
clue
on
a
separate
paper
these
words
are
written
the
stair
across
the
hall
between
the
bedhead
and
the
wall
a
careful
searching
will
reveal
the
noble
fortune
i
conceal
there
could
anything
be
plainer
than
that
then
the
money
is
the
house
exclaimed
patty
take
your
choice
there
are
the
two
declarations
it
may
be
he
concealed
the
money
in
one
place
and
then
transferred
it
to
another
or
it
may
be
he
put
part
in
the
ground
and
part
in
the
house
but
the
bedhead
and
the
wall
is
so
definite
there
are
not
so
very
many
bedrooms
you
know
true
enough
and
of
course
when
my
father
found
that
paper
he
went
directly
upstairs
crossed
the
hall
and
so
reached
uncle
marmaduke
own
bedroom
the
furniture
had
been
moved
about
but
grandy
remembered
where
the
head
of
the
bed
stood
in
uncle
time
they
searched
thoroughly
took
up
flooring
took
down
wainscoting
and
all
that
to
no
avail
of
course
they
tried
other
yes
tell
her
about
it
grandy
yes
said
cromarty
placidly
all
the
bedrooms
in
the
house
even
the
servants
rooms
were
subjected
to
most
careful
scrutiny
although
so
many
years
had
elapsed
i
could
remember
where
the
various
beds
stood
when
marmaduke
was
with
us
behind
each
we
had
the
walls
sounded
and
in
some
cases
broken
into
we
even
looked
for
pockets
or
receptacles
of
some
sort
on
the
backs
of
the
headboards
themselves
but
never
a
trace
of
anything
could
we
find
it
very
exciting
said
patty
how
can
you
all
be
so
calm
about
it
i
should
think
you
be
searching
every
minute
you
must
remember
dear
said
hartley
it
an
old
story
to
us
at
first
we
were
indeed
excited
for
several
years
we
searched
almost
continuously
then
hope
began
to
fail
and
our
investigations
became
intermittent
every
now
and
then
we
would
make
a
fresh
attempt
but
invariably
repeated
failures
dampened
our
enthusiasm
it
interesting
sighed
patty
ca
we
get
up
a
little
of
the
old
enthusiasm
and
do
some
searching
while
i
here
indeed
we
can
cried
bob
would
you
prefer
an
excavating
party
with
picks
and
spades
or
an
indoor
performance
in
the
old
bedrooms
both
declared
patty
of
course
i
know
how
absurd
it
is
to
go
over
the
ground
that
has
already
been
worn
threadbare
but
but
oh
if
we
find
it
grandma
cromarty
smiled
forgive
me
dearie
she
said
but
i
heard
those
sentiments
from
all
my
guests
to
whom
we
have
told
the
story
for
the
past
years
and
though
i
do
want
to
seem
ungrateful
for
your
interest
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
there
is
no
hope
oh
yes
there
is
grandy
said
sinclair
but
there
is
nothing
else
there
no
probability
scarcely
a
possibility
but
we
give
up
hope
never
agreed
bob
but
mabel
expression
plainly
showed
that
she
had
the
faintest
glimmering
of
a
hope
it
does
seem
so
strange
said
patty
thoughtfully
to
have
the
two
directions
and
both
so
explicit
no
not
explicit
they
not
that
but
both
so
definite
hardly
definite
either
said
bob
except
that
they
seem
to
reveal
the
fact
that
there
a
fortune
concealed
about
the
place
oh
it
makes
me
frantic
i
feel
so
helpless
there
no
use
storming
about
it
bob
my
boy
said
his
mother
and
patty
you
must
set
us
down
as
too
mercenary
in
this
matter
but
i
think
you
know
that
we
as
a
family
long
for
the
means
which
would
enable
us
to
keep
up
this
dear
old
place
as
it
should
be
and
not
let
its
beautiful
parks
and
gardens
go
uncared
for
and
neglected
i
do
know
cried
patty
and
it
makes
me
furious
to
think
that
the
money
your
own
money
is
perhaps
within
your
reach
and
yet
you
get
it
oh
why
did
marmaduke
say
just
where
he
put
it
he
did
said
bob
smiling
yes
so
he
did
well
i
tear
up
every
square
foot
of
ground
on
the
whole
estate
then
remember
patty
said
sinclair
in
his
quiet
way
there
are
nearly
ten
thousand
acres
in
all
and
except
for
meadowlands
and
water
there
are
oaks
and
firs
on
nearly
every
acre
the
fortune
itself
would
scarcely
pay
for
all
that
labour
well
then
i
tear
the
house
to
pieces
oh
no
you
would
said
hartley
and
beside
that
has
almost
been
done
my
husband
had
so
much
of
the
woodwork
and
plaster
removed
that
i
almost
feared
he
would
bring
the
house
down
about
our
ears
and
it
is
such
a
big
rambling
old
place
it
is
hopeless
to
think
of
examining
it
really
thoroughly
patty
glanced
around
at
the
great
hall
she
was
in
the
groined
ceiling
with
its
intricate
carvings
at
the
intersections
the
cornice
carved
in
deep
relief
with
heraldic
bosses
and
massive
patterns
the
tall
columns
and
pilasters
all
seemed
part
of
an
old
monument
which
it
would
be
desecration
to
break
into
i
wonder
where
it
is
she
said
indoors
or
out
i
think
it
out
of
doors
said
sinclair
i
think
uncle
hid
it
in
the
house
first
and
then
wrote
his
exquisite
poem
about
the
poke
perhaps
it
was
merely
a
pocket
of
leather
or
canvas
that
hung
behind
the
headboard
of
his
own
bed
in
that
case
all
prying
into
the
walls
would
mean
nothing
then
i
think
as
that
was
only
a
temporary
he
later
buried
it
in
the
ground
between
some
special
oak
tree
and
fir
tree
or
trees
i
think
too
he
left
or
meant
to
leave
some
more
of
his
poetry
to
tell
which
trees
but
owing
to
his
sudden
taking
off
he
do
this
sinclair
said
bob
as
our
american
friend
dooley
says
opinions
is
inthrestin
but
not
convincin
as
opinions
they
fine
but
i
wish
i
had
some
facts
if
uncle
had
only
left
a
cryptogram
or
a
cipher
i
like
it
better
than
all
that
rhymed
foolishness
perhaps
it
is
foolishness
said
patty
i
think
with
sinclair
likely
marmaduke
wrote
the
indoor
one
first
and
then
changed
the
and
wrote
the
other
but
how
could
he
do
all
this
hiding
and
rehiding
without
being
seen
i
went
up
to
london
every
season
said
cromarty
and
of
course
took
emmeline
with
me
marmaduke
always
stayed
here
and
thus
had
ample
opportunity
to
do
what
he
would
indeed
he
usually
had
great
while
we
were
away
one
year
he
had
the
italian
garden
laid
out
another
year
he
had
a
new
porter
lodge
built
this
was
done
the
last
year
of
his
life
and
as
he
had
masons
around
so
much
at
that
time
repairing
the
cellars
and
all
that
we
thought
later
that
he
might
have
had
a
arranged
in
the
wall
behind
the
head
of
his
bed
but
if
so
we
never
could
find
it
and
have
you
dug
under
the
trees
much
persisted
patty
who
could
not
accept
the
hopelessness
of
the
others
dug
exclaimed
bob
i
blistered
my
hands
by
the
hour
i
viewed
fir
trees
and
oaks
until
i
know
every
one
on
the
place
by
heart
trudged
a
line
from
oaks
to
firs
and
starting
in
the
middle
i
dug
both
ways
but
i
nearly
ready
to
give
up
not
quite
though
i
making
a
thorough
search
of
all
the
books
in
the
library
on
the
chance
of
finding
some
other
message
but
there
are
such
a
lot
of
books
i
been
at
it
for
three
years
now
off
and
on
and
i
only
way
round
and
not
a
paper
yet
except
a
few
old
letters
and
bills
i
help
you
bob
said
patty
oh
i
love
to
do
something
toward
the
search
even
if
i
do
find
a
thing
i
begin
you
tell
me
what
books
you
done
i
will
indeed
i
be
jolly
glad
to
have
help
and
you
can
do
as
much
as
you
like
before
your
young
enthusiasm
wears
off
i
do
it
gladly
said
patty
and
then
they
discovered
that
the
evening
had
flown
away
and
it
was
bedtime
as
they
went
upstairs
mabel
followed
patty
to
her
room
and
sat
down
for
a
little
chat
patty
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
and
as
she
took
off
her
hair
ribbon
and
folded
it
round
her
hand
she
said
even
if
we
do
find
anything
you
be
no
worse
off
and
it
such
fun
to
hunt
they
did
tell
you
all
patty
said
mabel
in
a
pathetic
tone
and
patty
turned
quickly
to
her
friend
why
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
of
course
we
never
been
rich
and
we
never
been
able
to
do
for
the
place
what
ought
to
be
done
for
it
but
we
have
been
able
to
live
here
and
now
now
if
we
ca
get
any
more
money
we
we
stay
here
oh
patty
patty
arms
went
round
mabel
as
the
poor
child
burst
into
tears
yes
she
said
sobbing
some
of
mother
business
interests
have
failed
it
all
come
on
lately
i
do
entirely
understand
it
but
anyway
we
may
soon
have
to
leave
cromarty
and
oh
patty
how
we
live
anywhere
else
and
what
worse
how
we
have
any
one
else
living
here
leave
cromarty
manor
where
you
all
lived
so
long
i
mean
your
ancestors
and
all
why
mabel
you
ca
do
that
but
we
have
to
we
have
money
enough
to
pay
the
servants
or
at
least
we
wo
have
soon
are
you
sure
of
all
this
dear
does
cromarty
expect
to
go
away
it
all
uncertain
we
do
know
but
mother
lawyer
thinks
better
sell
or
let
the
place
of
course
we
wo
sell
it
but
it
would
be
almost
as
bad
to
let
it
think
of
strangers
here
i
ca
think
of
such
a
thing
it
seems
impossible
but
perhaps
matters
may
turn
out
better
than
you
think
perhaps
you
wo
have
to
go
that
what
sinclair
says
and
mother
but
i
sure
the
worst
will
happen
now
mabel
stop
that
i
wo
let
you
look
on
the
dark
side
and
anyway
you
not
to
think
any
more
about
it
you
wo
sleep
a
wink
if
you
get
nervous
and
worried
now
put
it
out
of
your
mind
and
let
talk
about
the
croquet
party
at
grace
meredith
how
are
we
going
over
you
and
i
are
to
drive
in
the
pony
cart
and
the
others
will
go
in
the
carriage
that
will
be
lovely
now
what
shall
we
wear
thus
tactfully
patty
led
mabel
thoughts
away
from
her
troubles
for
the
time
at
least
and
when
the
two
friends
parted
for
the
night
they
both
went
healthily
and
happily
to
sleep
chapter
xvi
the
croquet
party
the
next
afternoon
the
two
girls
started
in
the
pony
cart
for
the
merediths
patty
loved
to
play
croquet
and
though
it
greatly
amused
her
to
hear
the
english
people
pronounce
the
word
as
if
it
were
spelled
yet
not
to
appear
peculiar
she
spoke
it
that
way
too
the
party
was
a
large
one
and
the
games
were
arranged
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
tournament
patty
partner
was
tom
meredith
and
as
he
played
a
fairly
good
game
they
easily
beat
their
first
opponents
but
later
on
they
found
themselves
matched
against
mabel
hartley
and
a
young
man
named
jack
stanton
stanton
was
an
expert
and
mabel
played
the
best
game
patty
had
ever
seen
a
girl
play
it
no
use
said
patty
as
they
began
the
game
tom
and
i
never
can
win
against
you
two
do
despair
said
tom
encouragingly
there
many
a
slip
you
know
the
game
progressed
until
when
tom
and
patty
were
about
of
the
way
around
mabel
was
passing
through
her
last
wicket
and
stanton
was
a
rover
be
careful
now
said
stanton
as
mabel
aimed
to
send
her
ball
through
the
arch
it
a
straight
shot
and
a
long
shot
and
liable
to
touch
the
post
and
that
just
what
happened
as
mabel
swift
clear
stroke
sent
the
ball
straight
through
the
wicket
it
went
spinning
on
and
hit
squarely
the
home
stake
jupiter
that
bad
luck
exclaimed
jack
stanton
they
jolly
well
beat
us
now
but
never
mind
perhaps
i
can
slip
through
yet
but
he
could
the
fact
that
they
had
two
plays
to
his
one
gave
patty
and
tom
a
great
advantage
tom
was
a
clever
manager
and
patty
followed
his
directions
implicitly
so
they
played
a
defensive
game
and
spent
much
time
keeping
ball
away
from
the
positions
he
desired
the
result
was
that
tom
and
patty
won
but
their
success
was
really
owing
to
mabel
mistake
in
going
out
the
test
was
to
win
two
games
out
of
three
so
with
one
game
in
favor
of
patty
side
they
began
the
next
patty
was
considered
a
good
croquet
player
in
america
but
in
england
the
rules
of
the
game
as
well
as
the
implements
were
so
different
that
it
seriously
impeded
her
progress
the
wickets
were
so
narrow
that
the
ball
could
barely
squeeze
through
if
aimed
straight
and
a
side
shot
through
one
was
impossible
but
all
this
added
to
the
zest
and
it
was
four
very
eager
young
people
who
strove
for
the
victory
the
second
game
went
easily
to
mabel
and
jack
stanton
and
then
the
third
the
decisive
one
was
begun
according
to
the
laws
of
the
tournament
this
was
the
final
game
the
opponents
had
already
vanquished
all
the
other
contestants
and
now
pitted
against
each
other
were
playing
for
the
prize
patty
knew
in
her
heart
she
would
be
glad
to
have
mabel
win
it
and
yet
so
strong
was
her
love
of
games
and
so
enthusiastic
her
natural
desire
to
succeed
that
she
tried
her
best
to
beat
the
third
game
all
played
conservatively
the
partners
kept
together
and
progressed
evenly
toward
the
last
jack
and
mabel
began
to
creep
ahead
tom
saw
this
and
said
to
patty
this
is
our
last
chance
if
we
plod
on
like
this
they
calmly
walk
out
and
leave
us
unless
we
can
make
a
brilliant
dash
of
some
sort
we
are
beaten
i
do
believe
i
can
said
patty
looking
doubtfully
at
her
ball
it
my
turn
and
unless
i
can
hit
mabel
ball
clear
across
the
grounds
i
ca
do
anything
that
just
it
you
hit
mabel
ball
so
patty
aimed
carefully
and
sent
her
ball
spinning
over
the
ground
toward
mabel
and
missed
it
by
a
hair
breadth
goody
cried
mabel
and
hitting
patty
ball
she
roqueted
it
back
where
it
had
come
from
now
here
our
very
lastest
chance
said
tom
with
a
groan
of
despair
and
i
sure
patty
i
wo
do
any
better
than
you
did
nor
did
he
although
not
far
from
jack
ball
at
which
he
aimed
there
was
a
wicket
in
the
way
which
sent
his
own
ball
glancing
off
at
an
angle
and
he
did
not
hit
his
opponent
a
minute
more
and
jack
skilfully
sent
mabel
ball
and
then
his
own
against
the
home
stake
and
the
game
was
over
the
onlookers
crowded
up
and
congratulated
the
winners
and
offered
condolence
to
patty
and
tom
patty
smiled
and
responded
merrily
she
did
not
try
to
lay
the
blame
on
the
unusual
shaped
wickets
or
short
heavy
mallets
she
declared
that
the
best
players
had
won
and
that
she
was
satisfied
and
indeed
she
was
when
she
saw
the
lovely
prize
that
was
given
to
mabel
she
was
deeply
thankful
that
she
had
won
it
it
was
a
white
parasol
of
silk
and
chiffon
with
a
pearl
handle
a
really
exquisite
dainty
affair
and
just
the
very
thing
mabel
had
wanted
but
could
afford
to
buy
as
for
patty
herself
she
had
several
parasols
and
so
was
delighted
that
mabel
had
won
but
though
she
truly
preferred
that
mabel
should
have
the
prize
she
felt
a
little
chagrined
at
losing
the
contest
for
like
all
people
who
are
fond
of
games
and
sports
patty
loved
to
win
these
feelings
though
she
successfully
concealed
and
gave
mabel
very
sincere
and
loving
congratulations
stanton
prize
was
a
pretty
scarf
pin
and
tom
meredith
loudly
bewailed
his
own
misfortune
in
losing
this
though
really
as
the
tournament
was
at
his
own
home
he
would
not
have
taken
the
prize
had
he
won
it
but
would
have
passed
it
on
to
the
one
with
the
next
highest
record
the
victors
were
cheered
and
applauded
and
were
then
led
in
triumph
to
the
pretty
tent
where
tea
was
being
served
if
patty
had
had
a
shadow
of
regret
that
she
had
not
been
the
honoured
one
it
was
lost
sight
of
in
her
gladness
that
it
fell
to
mabel
lot
you
a
plucky
one
said
tom
meredith
who
was
observing
her
closely
you
a
good
loser
are
you
i
do
know
said
patty
thoughtfully
i
want
to
be
but
do
you
know
i
just
love
to
win
contests
or
games
and
when
i
lose
i
ashamed
to
say
it
but
i
do
feel
put
out
of
course
you
do
that
only
natural
and
that
why
i
say
you
a
good
loser
if
you
did
care
tuppence
whether
you
won
or
not
it
would
be
much
to
your
credit
to
look
smiling
and
pleasant
when
you
lose
but
since
you
care
a
whole
lot
you
a
jolly
plucky
girl
to
take
it
so
well
now
what
can
i
get
for
you
an
ice
yes
please
said
patty
really
gratified
at
tom
appreciative
words
how
long
are
you
staying
with
the
hartleys
tom
asked
as
returning
with
ices
he
found
cosy
seats
at
a
small
table
for
himself
and
patty
two
or
three
weeks
longer
i
think
but
i
shall
hate
to
go
away
for
i
become
so
interested
in
their
that
i
ca
stop
trying
to
solve
it
oh
you
mean
that
old
affair
of
the
hidden
fortune
i
do
believe
there
any
at
all
i
think
the
old
man
who
pretended
to
hide
it
was
merely
guying
them
oh
no
that
ca
be
why
it
all
sounds
so
real
and
natural
the
story
of
the
hiding
i
mean
yes
but
why
should
he
want
to
hide
it
why
not
bank
it
decently
like
other
people
oh
because
he
was
eccentric
people
who
are
naturally
queer
or
freakish
are
always
hiding
things
and
i
know
it
silly
of
me
but
i
going
to
try
to
find
that
money
i
lots
of
faith
in
your
energy
and
perseverance
but
i
ca
think
you
succeed
in
that
job
better
try
something
easier
i
do
think
i
can
say
i
expect
to
succeed
but
i
going
to
try
and
who
can
tell
what
might
happen
who
indeed
but
you
know
of
course
that
the
cromarty
people
have
been
hunting
it
for
nearly
forty
years
yes
said
patty
and
her
eyes
fairly
blazed
with
determination
yes
but
i
am
an
american
tom
meredith
shouted
with
laughter
good
for
you
little
stars
and
stripes
he
cried
i
always
heard
of
the
cleverness
of
the
yankees
but
if
you
can
trace
the
cromarty
fortune
i
believe
you
a
witch
for
sure
are
there
witches
in
that
new
england
of
yours
i
believe
there
used
to
be
and
my
ancestors
some
of
them
were
salem
people
that
may
be
where
i
get
my
taste
for
divination
and
solving
problems
i
just
love
puzzles
of
all
sorts
and
if
the
old
cromarty
gentleman
had
only
left
a
cipher
message
it
would
have
been
fun
to
puzzle
it
out
he
did
leave
messages
of
some
sort
did
he
maybe
they
are
more
subtle
than
you
think
i
been
wondering
about
that
they
might
mean
something
entirely
different
from
what
they
sound
like
but
i
ca
see
any
light
that
way
headboard
of
a
bed
against
a
wall
is
pretty
practical
and
seem
to
mean
anything
else
and
the
oak
trees
and
fir
trees
are
there
in
abundance
but
that
the
trouble
with
them
there
are
so
many
go
on
and
do
all
you
can
my
child
you
get
over
it
the
sooner
if
you
work
hard
on
it
at
first
we
all
been
through
it
nearly
everybody
in
this
part
of
the
country
has
tried
at
one
time
or
another
to
guess
the
cromarty
riddle
but
i
the
first
american
to
try
insisted
patty
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
quite
so
miss
yankee
doodle
doo
and
i
wish
you
success
where
my
own
countrymen
have
failed
tom
said
this
with
such
a
nice
kindly
air
that
patty
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
her
own
vaunting
attitude
but
sometimes
patty
showed
a
decided
tendency
to
in
her
own
powers
and
though
she
tried
to
correct
it
it
would
spring
up
now
and
again
then
the
hartley
boys
joined
them
and
all
discussion
of
the
missing
fortune
was
dropped
it
was
soon
time
to
take
leave
and
as
it
was
already
twilight
sinclair
proposed
that
he
should
drive
patty
home
in
the
pony
cart
and
mabel
should
return
in
the
carriage
mabel
quite
agreed
to
this
saying
that
after
her
croquet
she
did
not
care
to
drive
the
road
lay
through
a
lovely
bit
of
country
and
patty
enjoyed
the
drive
home
with
sinclair
she
always
liked
to
talk
with
him
he
was
so
gentle
and
kindly
while
not
so
merry
as
bob
or
as
tom
meredith
sinclair
was
an
interesting
talker
and
patty
always
felt
that
she
was
benefited
by
his
conversation
he
told
her
much
about
the
country
as
they
drove
along
described
the
life
and
work
of
the
villagers
and
pointed
out
buildings
or
other
objects
of
interest
they
passed
several
fine
estates
whose
towering
mansions
could
be
seen
half
hidden
by
trees
or
boldly
placed
on
a
summit
but
no
place
is
as
beautiful
as
cromarty
said
sinclair
and
patty
entirely
agreed
with
them
is
it
true
that
you
may
have
to
leave
it
she
asked
thinking
it
wiser
to
refer
to
it
casually
sinclair
frowned
who
been
talking
to
you
he
said
mabel
i
suppose
well
yes
there
is
a
chance
that
we
have
to
let
it
for
a
term
of
years
i
hope
not
but
i
ca
tell
yet
but
even
if
so
it
will
be
only
temporary
as
soon
as
i
get
fairly
established
in
my
career
i
hope
to
make
money
enough
to
take
care
of
it
all
a
few
years
hence
when
i
on
my
feet
and
through
college
it
will
be
easier
all
round
but
if
some
business
troubles
that
are
now
impending
do
blow
over
there
be
no
income
to
keep
things
going
and
we
have
to
to
but
that
happen
sinclair
spoke
almost
desperately
and
patty
saw
his
fingers
clench
around
the
reins
he
was
holding
i
wonder
said
patty
slowly
for
she
was
not
quite
sure
how
what
she
was
about
to
say
would
be
received
i
wonder
sinclair
if
we
not
good
friends
enough
you
and
i
for
me
to
speak
plainly
to
you
the
young
man
gave
her
a
quick
earnest
glance
go
on
he
said
briefly
it
only
this
said
patty
still
hesitating
my
father
has
lots
of
money
could
you
could
he
lend
you
some
sinclair
looked
at
her
squarely
now
and
spoke
in
low
stern
tones
never
suggest
such
a
thing
again
the
cromartys
do
not
borrow
not
even
from
a
friend
said
patty
softly
not
even
from
a
friend
repeated
sinclair
but
his
voice
was
more
gentle
you
do
understand
i
suppose
he
went
on
but
we
would
leave
cromarty
for
ever
before
we
would
stay
on
such
terms
no
said
patty
i
do
understand
i
should
think
you
be
as
glad
to
accept
a
friend
help
as
he
would
be
to
offer
it
if
you
do
me
a
real
kindness
patty
you
never
even
mention
such
an
idea
again
i
know
you
mean
well
and
i
thank
you
but
it
absolutely
impossible
then
there
only
one
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
said
patty
with
an
effort
at
lightness
and
that
to
find
your
buried
fortune
ah
that
would
be
a
help
cried
sinclair
also
assuming
a
gayer
tone
if
you
help
us
to
do
that
i
set
up
a
memorial
tablet
to
your
cleverness
where
will
you
set
it
between
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
yes
if
you
find
the
fortune
there
but
if
i
find
it
behind
the
headboard
that
no
sort
of
a
place
for
a
tablet
you
can
choose
your
own
spot
for
your
roll
of
fame
and
i
see
to
it
that
the
memorial
is
a
worthy
one
and
will
you
put
fresh
flowers
on
it
every
day
yes
indeed
for
if
i
mean
you
find
the
fortune
for
us
the
gardens
will
have
immediate
attention
then
i
must
set
to
work
at
once
said
patty
with
pretended
gravity
but
in
her
heart
she
registered
a
mental
vow
to
try
in
earnest
to
fulfil
the
promise
given
in
jest
chapter
xvii
the
griffin
and
the
rose
although
the
hartleys
had
practically
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
finding
the
hidden
money
they
could
help
being
imbued
with
enthusiasm
indeed
it
took
little
to
rouse
the
sleeping
fires
of
interest
that
never
were
entirely
extinguished
but
though
they
talked
it
over
by
the
hour
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
talk
one
day
patty
went
out
all
by
herself
determined
to
see
if
she
find
some
combination
of
an
oak
tree
and
a
group
of
firs
that
would
somehow
seem
especially
prominent
but
after
looking
at
a
score
or
more
of
such
combinations
she
realised
that
task
was
futile
she
looked
at
the
ground
under
some
of
them
but
who
could
expect
a
mark
of
any
kind
on
the
ground
after
nearly
forty
years
no
unless
marmaduke
cromarty
had
marked
his
with
a
stone
or
iron
plate
it
would
probably
never
be
found
by
his
heirs
search
in
the
house
was
equally
unsatisfactory
what
availed
it
to
scan
a
wall
or
a
bedstead
that
had
been
scrutinised
for
years
by
eager
anxious
eyes
and
then
patty
set
her
wits
to
work
she
tried
to
think
where
an
erratic
old
gentleman
would
secrete
his
wealth
and
she
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
most
natural
place
was
in
the
ground
on
his
estate
the
location
to
be
designated
by
some
obscure
message
and
surely
the
message
was
obscure
enough
she
kept
her
promise
to
help
bob
in
his
task
of
going
through
all
the
books
in
the
library
this
was
no
small
piece
of
work
for
it
was
not
enough
to
shake
each
book
and
let
loose
papers
if
any
drop
out
some
of
the
old
papers
had
been
found
pinned
to
leaves
and
so
each
book
must
be
run
through
in
such
a
way
that
every
page
could
be
glanced
at
nor
was
this
a
particularly
pleasant
task
for
hartley
had
made
it
a
rule
that
when
her
own
children
went
over
the
old
books
they
were
to
dust
them
as
they
went
along
thus
she
said
at
least
some
good
would
be
accomplished
though
no
hidden
documents
might
be
found
of
course
she
did
not
request
patty
to
do
this
but
learning
of
the
custom
patty
insisted
on
doing
it
and
many
an
hour
she
spent
in
the
old
library
clad
in
apron
and
her
progress
was
rather
slow
for
patty
often
became
absorbed
in
the
old
volumes
and
dropping
down
on
the
or
the
old
steps
to
the
gallery
would
read
away
oblivious
to
all
else
till
some
one
came
to
hunt
for
her
at
last
one
day
her
patient
search
met
a
reward
in
an
old
book
she
found
several
of
what
were
beyond
all
doubt
marmaduke
papers
without
looking
at
them
closely
patty
took
the
book
straight
to
cromarty
dear
me
said
the
old
lady
putting
on
her
glasses
have
we
really
found
something
i
declare
i
quite
nervous
over
it
emmeline
you
read
them
hartley
was
a
bit
excited
too
and
as
for
patty
and
mabel
they
nearly
went
frantic
at
their
elders
slowness
in
opening
the
old
and
yellow
papers
there
were
several
letters
a
few
bills
and
some
memoranda
the
letters
and
bills
were
of
no
special
interest
but
on
one
of
the
small
bits
of
paper
was
another
rhymed
couplet
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
direction
it
read
where
the
angry
griffin
shows
ruthless
tear
away
the
rose
oh
exclaimed
patty
it
another
direction
how
to
get
the
fortune
oh
mabel
it
will
be
all
right
yet
oh
where
is
the
angry
griffin
is
it
over
a
rosebush
you
only
to
pull
up
the
rosebush
and
there
you
are
mabel
looked
bewildered
so
did
the
older
ladies
speak
somebody
cried
patty
dancing
about
in
excitement
is
there
any
angry
griffin
there
must
be
that
the
trouble
said
hartley
there
are
so
many
of
them
why
there
are
angry
griffins
on
the
gates
over
the
lodge
doors
on
the
marbles
in
the
gardens
and
all
over
the
house
of
course
there
are
said
mabel
you
must
have
noticed
them
patty
there
one
now
and
she
pointed
to
a
bit
of
wood
carving
over
the
door
frame
of
the
room
they
were
in
i
do
care
it
means
something
i
know
it
does
declared
patty
we
work
it
out
yet
i
wish
the
boys
were
home
they
soon
be
here
said
cromarty
i
ca
help
thinking
that
it
does
mean
something
marmaduke
was
very
fond
of
roses
and
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
plant
a
rosebush
over
his
buried
treasure
that
it
cried
patty
now
where
is
there
a
rosebush
growing
and
one
of
the
angry
griffins
near
it
there
probably
are
some
in
the
rose
garden
said
cromarty
i
do
remember
any
though
come
on
mabel
said
patty
let
go
and
look
i
ca
wait
another
minute
away
flew
the
two
girls
and
for
the
next
hour
they
hovered
about
the
rosebushes
with
more
energy
than
is
often
shown
by
the
busiest
of
bees
i
wish
old
uncle
marmaduke
had
been
less
of
a
poet
said
mabel
as
they
sat
down
a
moment
to
rest
and
more
of
a
a
more
straightforward
suggested
patty
if
he
only
written
a
few
words
of
plain
prose
and
left
it
with
his
lawyer
all
this
trouble
need
have
been
well
i
suppose
he
did
intend
to
make
it
plain
before
he
died
but
he
went
off
so
suddenly
oh
here
are
the
boys
sinclair
and
bob
came
bounding
down
toward
the
rose
garden
followed
more
sedately
by
their
mother
and
grandmother
not
a
sign
of
a
griffin
of
a
rose
said
patty
disconsolately
oh
you
have
looked
all
round
yet
said
bob
it
such
fun
to
have
something
to
look
for
besides
fir
trees
and
beds
i
going
to
make
a
close
search
of
course
said
sinclair
the
same
rose
bush
would
be
here
now
that
was
here
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
but
it
would
have
been
renewed
said
cromarty
we
always
tried
to
keep
the
flowers
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
then
here
goes
to
interview
every
griffin
on
the
place
declared
bob
jolly
of
old
uncle
to
mark
the
spot
with
a
rosebush
and
a
griffin
that
what
i
call
decent
of
him
and
you
a
wonder
patty
to
find
the
old
paper
oh
that
nothing
said
patty
i
just
followed
your
orders
about
the
books
if
you
kept
at
it
yourself
you
have
found
the
same
book
i
so
but
i
glad
you
helped
the
good
work
along
oh
dear
no
rosebush
seems
to
be
near
a
griffin
and
the
griffins
seem
positively
afraid
of
the
rosebushes
and
try
as
they
would
no
angry
griffin
could
they
find
with
a
rosebush
near
it
griffins
there
were
in
plenty
both
angry
and
grinning
also
were
there
plenty
of
roses
but
they
were
arranged
in
beds
and
in
no
case
were
guarded
or
menaced
by
angry
griffins
never
mind
said
sinclair
as
they
returned
to
the
house
for
dinner
it
something
to
work
on
i
shall
stay
at
home
and
try
to
find
that
particular
rosebush
or
the
place
where
it
used
to
be
maybe
it
a
stone
rose
said
patty
as
she
touched
a
rose
carved
in
stone
that
was
part
of
an
ornamental
urn
whose
handles
were
the
heads
of
angry
griffins
sinclair
stared
at
her
you
right
he
said
slowly
as
if
grasping
a
great
thought
much
more
likely
to
be
a
rose
of
stone
or
marble
and
when
ruthlessly
torn
away
the
secret
will
be
revealed
oh
mother
there
hope
patty
had
never
seen
the
placid
sinclair
so
excited
and
they
all
went
to
their
rooms
to
get
ready
for
dinner
with
a
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
conversation
at
dinner
was
all
on
the
engrossing
subject
everybody
made
suggestions
and
everybody
recalled
various
griffins
in
odd
nooks
and
corners
each
being
sure
that
was
just
the
place
uncle
would
choose
after
dinner
the
young
people
were
anxious
to
go
out
and
search
more
but
it
had
begun
to
rain
so
they
all
went
into
the
library
and
again
scrutinised
the
old
papers
patty
had
found
they
looked
through
more
books
too
but
found
nothing
further
of
interest
at
last
wearied
with
the
hunt
patty
threw
herself
into
a
big
armchair
and
declared
she
would
do
no
more
that
night
i
should
say
not
said
bob
you
done
quite
enough
in
giving
us
this
new
start
although
as
patty
had
said
the
looking
through
all
the
old
books
was
bob
plan
he
generously
gave
her
the
credit
of
this
new
find
sinclair
threw
himself
on
a
long
leather
couch
and
began
to
sing
softly
some
of
their
nonsense
songs
as
he
often
did
when
tired
out
the
others
joined
and
for
a
time
the
fortune
was
left
to
take
care
of
itself
very
pleasant
were
the
four
fresh
young
voices
and
the
elders
listened
gladly
to
their
music
in
the
middle
of
a
song
patty
stopped
and
sat
bolt
upright
her
eyes
staring
at
a
door
opposite
her
as
if
she
had
never
seen
it
before
gracious
goodness
patty
said
mabel
what
is
the
matter
what
is
it
little
one
said
sinclair
still
humming
the
refrain
of
the
interrupted
song
patty
pointed
to
the
door
or
rather
to
the
elaborately
carved
door
frame
and
said
slowly
i
been
reading
a
lot
in
the
old
architecture
books
and
they
often
used
to
have
secret
hiding
places
in
the
walls
and
look
at
that
door
frame
there
an
angry
griffin
on
one
jamb
and
a
smiling
griffin
on
the
other
and
under
each
is
a
rose
that
is
it
a
blossom
a
sort
of
conventional
flower
that
they
always
call
a
rose
in
architecture
though
i
suppose
said
sinclair
by
any
other
name
it
would
look
as
sweet
patty
my
child
you
dreaming
that
old
carving
is
as
solid
as
gibraltar
and
that
old
griffin
is
very
angry
anyway
he
just
looks
rather
purse
proud
and
haughty
but
it
the
only
griffin
that
near
a
rose
persisted
patty
and
he
is
angry
compared
to
the
griffin
opposite
to
him
i
believe
the
girl
is
right
said
bob
who
was
already
examining
the
carvings
in
question
the
rose
does
look
movable
exactly
but
it
is
not
quite
like
this
other
rose
it
more
deeply
cut
by
this
time
all
had
clustered
about
the
door
frame
and
one
after
another
poked
and
pushed
at
the
wooden
rose
there
something
in
it
persisted
bob
in
the
idea
i
mean
if
there
a
secret
in
that
upright
carved
beam
that
rose
is
the
key
to
it
see
how
deeply
it
cut
in
compared
to
the
other
and
i
can
almost
see
a
crack
all
round
it
as
if
it
could
be
removed
may
i
try
to
get
it
out
grandy
certainly
my
boy
we
must
leave
a
stone
unturned
a
rose
unturned
you
mean
clair
what
shall
we
ruthlessly
tear
it
away
with
i
hate
to
take
a
chisel
to
this
beautiful
old
door
try
a
corkscrew
said
mabel
you
mean
a
gimlet
said
bob
that
a
good
idea
fetching
a
gimlet
he
bored
a
hole
right
in
the
centre
of
the
carved
blossom
but
though
it
turned
and
creaked
a
little
it
would
come
out
it
must
come
said
sinclair
it
turns
so
that
proves
it
meant
to
be
movable
it
probably
has
some
hinge
or
spring
that
is
rusted
and
so
it
does
work
as
it
ought
to
we
have
to
take
hammer
and
chisel
shall
we
grandy
the
boys
were
deferential
to
cromarty
for
they
well
knew
that
she
was
tired
of
having
the
old
house
torn
up
to
no
avail
but
surely
this
was
an
important
development
yes
indeed
boys
if
your
uncle
words
mean
anything
they
mean
that
it
must
be
ruthlessly
torn
away
if
removed
at
all
for
quite
ten
minutes
the
two
boys
worked
away
with
their
tools
endeavouring
to
mar
the
carving
as
little
as
might
be
but
resolved
to
succeed
in
their
undertaking
at
last
the
wooden
rose
fell
out
in
their
hands
leaving
a
round
opening
peering
in
sinclair
saw
a
small
iron
knob
which
seemed
to
be
part
of
a
rusty
spring
greatly
excited
he
tried
to
push
or
turn
it
but
could
move
it
anyway
we
getting
warm
he
cried
and
his
glowing
face
corroborated
his
words
the
boys
took
turns
in
working
at
the
stubborn
spring
trying
with
forceps
and
pincers
to
move
it
until
at
last
something
seemed
to
give
way
and
the
whole
front
of
the
door
jamb
fell
out
as
one
panel
behind
it
was
a
series
of
small
pigeon
holes
one
above
the
other
all
filled
with
neatly
piled
papers
though
yellow
with
age
the
papers
were
carefully
folded
labelled
and
dated
patty
cried
mabel
as
she
embraced
her
friend
you
found
our
fortune
for
us
do
be
too
sure
said
patty
laughing
and
almost
crying
at
the
same
time
so
excited
was
she
your
uncle
marmaduke
was
of
such
uncertain
ways
i
should
wonder
if
these
were
merely
more
files
of
his
immortal
verse
they
bills
declared
sinclair
as
he
ran
over
a
packet
he
took
from
a
shelf
let
look
them
all
over
systematically
said
bob
let
all
sit
round
the
table
and
one
of
us
read
out
what
the
paper
is
about
then
if
we
come
to
anything
important
we
all
know
it
at
once
this
plan
was
adopted
and
sinclair
as
the
oldest
was
chosen
to
read
he
sat
at
the
head
of
the
long
library
table
and
the
others
were
at
either
side
but
the
packets
of
bills
though
interesting
in
a
general
way
had
no
bearing
on
the
great
question
of
the
fortune
the
papers
were
all
bills
not
even
a
bit
of
poetry
sighed
patty
as
sinclair
laid
aside
one
after
another
of
the
receipted
bills
for
merchandise
household
goods
clothing
and
labour
these
might
interest
a
historian
said
sinclair
as
they
throw
some
light
on
the
prices
of
goods
at
that
time
but
we
keep
on
we
may
come
to
something
of
interest
yet
i
hope
so
said
bob
i
so
anxious
that
nothing
less
than
a
straight
direction
to
the
fortune
would
satisfy
me
well
here
something
said
sinclair
whatever
it
may
mean
the
paper
he
had
just
unfolded
was
a
mason
bill
containing
only
one
item
the
bill
was
made
out
in
due
form
by
one
martin
campbell
and
was
properly
receipted
as
paid
and
its
single
item
read
to
constructing
one
secret
pocket
three
guineas
oh
cried
patty
breathless
with
excitement
then
there
is
a
secret
pocket
or
poke
as
your
exasperating
uncle
calls
it
there
must
be
said
sinclair
and
now
that
we
know
that
we
going
to
find
it
of
course
we
assumed
there
was
one
but
we
had
only
that
foolish
doggerel
to
prove
it
now
this
regular
bill
establishes
it
as
a
fact
beyond
all
doubt
do
you
know
this
martin
campbell
grandy
i
know
there
was
a
mason
by
that
name
who
worked
here
several
times
for
your
uncle
he
came
down
from
leicester
but
of
course
i
know
nothing
more
of
him
we
find
him
declared
bob
we
make
him
give
up
the
secret
of
the
pocket
maybe
he
dead
by
this
time
said
sinclair
was
he
an
old
man
grandy
i
do
know
my
dear
i
never
saw
him
he
worked
here
when
i
was
away
in
london
i
fear
however
he
is
not
alive
now
oh
perhaps
he
is
it
was
only
about
years
ago
or
forty
that
he
built
this
pocket
to
be
exact
the
date
on
the
bill
proves
that
well
you
must
go
to
see
him
said
hartley
rising
but
now
my
children
you
must
go
to
bed
you
ca
learn
any
more
and
we
will
pick
up
the
broken
thread
patty
my
dear
child
you
are
doing
a
great
deal
for
us
it
is
anything
yet
said
patty
but
oh
if
it
only
leads
to
something
i
shall
be
so
glad
chapter
xviii
the
old
but
sinclair
search
for
the
old
mason
in
leicester
was
absolutely
unsuccessful
he
learned
that
martin
campbell
had
died
many
years
ago
and
had
left
no
direct
descendants
a
cousin
of
the
old
mason
told
sinclair
all
this
and
said
too
that
there
were
no
books
or
papers
or
accounts
of
the
dead
man
left
in
existence
so
sinclair
returned
home
disappointed
but
not
entirely
discouraged
we
find
it
yet
he
said
to
patty
we
have
proof
of
a
now
we
must
discover
it
we
will
declared
patty
but
it
so
exasperating
not
to
know
whether
the
old
mason
built
that
indoors
or
out
out
i
think
said
sinclair
it
probably
a
sunken
bin
or
vault
of
brick
made
and
carefully
concealed
yes
it
certainly
carefully
concealed
patty
agreed
sinclair
was
entitled
to
a
fortnight
vacation
from
his
law
studies
and
he
arranged
to
take
it
at
this
time
for
now
that
the
interest
was
revived
all
were
eager
to
make
search
all
the
time
let
be
systematic
about
it
said
bob
and
divide
the
estate
up
into
sections
then
let
examine
each
section
in
turn
this
sounded
well
but
it
was
weary
work
in
the
wooded
land
especially
it
was
hopeless
to
look
for
any
indicatory
mark
beneath
the
undergrowth
of
forty
years
but
each
morning
the
four
young
people
started
out
with
renewed
determination
to
keep
at
it
at
any
rate
on
rainy
days
they
searched
about
the
house
having
found
one
secret
panel
they
hoped
for
more
and
the
boys
went
about
tapping
the
walls
or
carved
woodwork
here
and
there
listening
for
a
hollow
sound
bob
and
patty
went
on
searching
the
books
but
though
a
number
of
old
papers
were
found
they
were
of
no
value
incidentally
patty
was
acquiring
a
store
of
information
of
various
sorts
though
too
eager
in
her
work
to
sit
down
and
read
any
book
through
she
scanned
many
pages
here
and
there
and
learned
much
that
was
interesting
and
useful
especially
did
she
like
books
that
described
the
old
castles
and
abbeys
of
england
there
were
many
of
these
books
both
architectural
and
historical
and
patty
lingered
over
the
illustrations
and
let
her
eyes
run
hastily
over
the
pages
of
description
one
afternoon
she
sat
in
turk
fashion
on
the
library
floor
absorbed
in
an
account
of
the
beautiful
old
mansion
known
as
audley
end
the
description
so
interested
her
that
she
read
on
and
on
and
in
her
perusal
she
came
to
this
sentence
there
are
other
curious
relics
among
them
the
chair
of
alexander
pope
and
the
carved
oak
head
of
cromwell
bed
converted
into
a
anything
in
reference
to
the
headboard
of
a
bedstead
caught
attention
and
she
read
the
paragraph
over
again
sinclair
she
called
but
he
had
gone
elsewhere
and
did
not
hear
her
patty
looked
around
at
the
mantel
or
in
the
library
but
it
was
so
evidently
a
part
of
the
plan
of
wall
decoration
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
anything
else
patty
sighed
it
would
have
been
so
lovely
she
thought
to
herself
if
it
only
had
been
a
bedhead
made
into
a
mantel
for
then
that
bothering
old
man
could
easily
have
tucked
his
money
between
it
and
the
wall
and
then
though
patty
thoughts
came
slowly
they
came
surely
and
she
remembered
that
in
the
great
hall
or
the
mantel
was
a
massive
affair
of
carved
oak
half
bewildered
patty
dropped
the
book
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
hall
no
one
was
there
and
the
girl
was
glad
of
it
for
if
she
really
was
on
the
eve
of
a
great
discovery
she
wanted
to
be
alone
at
first
as
she
entered
the
room
the
lines
came
to
her
mind
above
the
stair
across
the
hall
between
the
bedhead
and
the
wall
and
she
noticed
that
the
stood
on
a
sort
of
wide
platform
which
extended
across
that
whole
end
of
the
hall
could
it
be
that
marmaduke
had
meant
above
this
platform
calling
it
a
stair
which
ran
across
the
great
hall
for
years
they
had
taken
the
direction
to
mean
up
the
staircase
and
across
the
corridor
or
hall
which
led
to
the
bedrooms
slowly
almost
as
if
afraid
patty
crossed
the
hall
stepped
up
on
the
platform
and
examined
the
old
she
could
tell
positively
but
surely
surely
it
looked
as
if
it
once
have
been
the
headboard
of
an
ancient
bed
it
certainly
was
different
in
its
workmanship
from
the
wood
carving
that
decorated
the
apartment
the
top
of
it
was
well
above
her
head
but
might
it
not
be
that
the
old
rhyme
meant
between
bedhead
and
the
wall
here
they
had
never
looked
it
must
be
that
it
was
not
generally
known
that
this
mantel
was
or
had
been
a
bedhead
still
as
if
in
a
daze
patty
went
and
sat
in
a
chair
facing
the
old
and
wondered
she
intended
to
call
the
others
in
a
moment
but
first
she
wanted
to
enjoy
alone
the
marvel
of
her
own
discovery
as
she
sat
there
scrutinising
every
detail
of
the
room
the
lines
kept
repeating
themselves
in
her
brain
above
the
stair
across
the
hall
between
the
bedhead
and
the
wall
if
the
secret
pocket
was
between
that
bedhead
and
the
wall
it
was
certainly
above
the
stair
across
the
hall
why
had
that
stair
or
platform
been
built
across
the
hall
it
was
a
peculiar
arrangement
this
question
patty
gave
up
but
she
thought
it
might
well
have
been
done
when
the
bedhead
was
set
up
there
in
order
to
make
the
higher
and
so
more
effective
patty
had
learned
something
of
architecture
in
her
library
browsings
above
the
high
mantel
was
a
large
painting
it
was
a
landscape
and
showed
a
beautiful
bit
of
scenery
without
buildings
or
people
in
the
foreground
were
several
distinct
trees
of
noble
proportions
they
firs
said
patty
to
herself
for
she
had
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
fir
trees
and
then
like
a
flash
through
her
brain
came
the
words
great
treasure
lieth
in
the
poke
between
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
the
secret
was
revealed
patty
knew
it
beside
the
bedhead
evidence
it
was
clear
to
her
mind
that
between
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
meant
between
these
painted
fir
trees
and
the
old
carved
oak
mantel
grasping
the
arms
of
her
chair
she
sat
still
a
minute
trying
to
take
it
all
in
and
then
looked
about
for
something
to
stand
on
that
she
might
examine
the
top
of
the
old
but
her
next
quick
thought
was
that
that
was
not
her
right
those
to
whom
the
fortune
belonged
must
make
the
investigation
themselves
sinclair
called
patty
again
mabel
hartley
where
are
you
all
bob
responded
first
and
seeing
by
patty
excited
face
that
she
had
discovered
something
important
he
went
in
search
of
the
others
at
last
they
were
all
gathered
in
the
great
hall
and
patty
sense
of
the
dramatic
proved
too
strong
to
allow
her
to
make
her
announcement
simply
people
she
said
i
have
made
a
discovery
that
is
i
think
i
have
if
i
am
right
the
cromarty
fortune
is
within
your
grasp
if
i
am
wrong
well
in
that
case
we
begin
all
over
again
tell
us
about
your
new
find
said
sinclair
selecting
a
comfortable
chair
and
sitting
down
as
if
for
a
long
session
is
it
another
bill
nobody
minded
being
chaffed
about
searching
or
finding
for
the
subject
was
treated
jocosely
as
well
as
seriously
patty
stood
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
carved
oak
and
addressed
her
audience
who
listened
half
laughing
half
eager
what
is
this
on
which
i
stand
she
demanded
a
rug
replied
mabel
promptly
i
mean
beneath
the
rug
the
floor
no
it
is
what
is
this
this
construction
across
the
room
a
platform
put
in
bob
willing
to
help
her
along
yes
but
what
else
could
it
be
called
i
in
earnest
a
step
suggested
sinclair
yes
a
step
but
could
it
be
called
a
stair
it
be
said
bob
but
i
do
believe
it
is
one
but
suppose
your
erratic
uncle
chose
to
call
it
that
oh
laughed
bob
you
mean
the
stair
in
the
poem
i
do
i
mean
the
stair
across
the
hall
what
oh
i
say
patty
now
you
jumbling
up
the
sense
no
i
not
i
straightening
out
the
sense
suppose
marmaduke
meant
the
stair
across
the
hall
and
meant
this
stair
and
this
hall
yes
but
go
on
said
sinclair
next
comes
the
bedhead
that
my
discovery
announced
patty
with
what
was
truly
forgivable
triumph
this
carved
oak
is
i
have
reason
to
believe
the
headboard
of
some
magnificent
ancient
bed
patty
fairfield
cried
sinclair
jumping
up
and
reaching
her
side
with
two
bounds
you
struck
it
what
a
girl
you
are
wait
a
minute
said
patty
pushing
him
back
i
entitled
to
a
hearing
take
your
seat
again
sir
until
i
unfold
the
rest
of
the
tale
patty
was
fairly
quivering
with
excitement
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
shone
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
went
on
mabel
with
clasped
hands
just
sat
and
looked
at
her
the
elder
ladies
were
plainly
bewildered
and
bob
was
trying
hard
to
sit
still
i
read
in
an
old
book
patty
went
on
how
somebody
else
used
a
carved
headboard
for
a
and
i
wondered
if
this
might
be
one
and
it
surely
looks
like
it
and
then
i
wondered
if
the
stair
across
the
hall
might
mean
this
platform
across
this
hall
and
i
think
it
does
but
that
not
all
my
really
important
discovery
is
this
patty
voice
had
sunk
to
a
thrilling
whisper
and
she
addressed
herself
to
cromarty
as
she
continued
i
think
the
other
rhyme
the
one
that
says
the
fortune
is
concealed
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
refers
to
this
same
place
and
means
between
the
painting
of
fir
trees
which
hangs
over
the
mantel
and
the
oak
mantel
itself
with
a
smiling
bow
patty
stepped
down
from
the
platform
and
taking
a
seat
by
old
cromarty
nestled
in
that
lady
loving
arms
the
two
boys
made
a
spring
for
the
mantel
but
paused
simultaneously
to
grasp
both
patty
hands
in
theirs
and
nearly
shake
her
arms
off
then
they
left
the
heroine
of
the
hour
to
mabel
and
hartley
and
began
to
investigate
the
chimney
piece
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
exclaimed
bob
great
is
it
and
here
for
years
we
cromarty
dubs
have
thought
that
meant
real
trees
to
think
it
took
a
yankee
to
tell
us
oh
patty
patty
take
down
that
historic
painting
and
put
up
a
tablet
to
the
honour
of
saint
patricia
for
you
surely
deserve
canonisation
the
bedhead
and
the
wall
ruminated
sinclair
well
here
goes
for
finding
an
opening
clambering
up
on
stools
both
boys
examined
the
place
where
the
mantel
shelf
touched
the
wall
the
ornate
carvings
of
the
mantel
left
many
interstices
where
coins
or
notes
might
be
dropped
through
yet
they
were
by
no
means
conspicuous
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
any
one
not
looking
for
them
crickets
cried
bob
there
a
jolly
place
for
the
precious
poke
to
be
located
i
going
down
cellar
to
see
if
i
can
find
traces
of
that
mason
work
come
on
clair
the
two
boys
flew
off
and
the
ladies
remained
discussing
the
wonderful
discovery
and
examining
the
old
i
can
see
it
was
a
bedhead
now
said
mabel
but
i
never
suspected
it
before
what
a
splendid
mantel
it
makes
did
you
ever
hear
its
history
grandy
no
dear
it
must
have
been
put
there
when
the
house
was
built
i
think
though
of
course
it
may
have
been
added
later
but
it
was
all
before
my
time
i
married
your
grandfather
cromarty
and
came
here
to
live
in
the
building
and
decorations
then
were
all
just
as
they
are
now
except
for
such
additions
as
marmaduke
made
he
may
have
had
that
mantel
set
up
in
earlier
years
i
do
know
he
was
very
fond
of
antique
carvings
back
came
the
boys
from
the
cellar
the
whole
chimney
is
bricked
up
sinclair
explained
we
could
get
into
it
without
tearing
it
all
down
and
do
you
know
what
i
think
grandy
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
take
away
the
up
here
and
do
our
investigating
from
this
end
then
if
we
find
anything
it
will
all
be
in
this
room
and
not
in
the
cellar
where
the
servants
can
pry
about
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
cromarty
and
i
put
the
whole
matter
in
your
hands
you
and
robert
are
the
sons
of
the
house
and
it
is
your
right
to
manage
its
affairs
then
i
say
tear
it
down
at
once
cried
bob
we
need
damage
the
carving
itself
and
all
that
we
break
away
of
plaster
or
inner
woodwork
can
easily
be
repaired
whatever
our
success
may
be
shall
we
begin
now
asked
sinclair
doubtfully
he
was
not
so
impetuous
as
bob
and
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
study
over
the
matter
first
yes
indeed
cried
his
impatient
brother
i
not
going
to
waste
a
minute
i
glad
i
a
bit
of
a
carpenter
though
not
an
expert
i
can
tear
down
if
i
ca
build
up
but
we
must
take
it
down
carefully
said
sinclair
these
screws
must
come
out
first
but
bob
had
already
gone
for
tools
and
soon
returned
with
chisels
gimlets
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
carpenter
here
goes
he
cried
as
he
put
the
big
in
the
first
screw
good
luck
to
the
cromartys
and
three
cheers
for
uncle
marmaduke
and
patty
fairfield
chapter
xix
the
discovery
the
removal
of
the
old
was
not
an
easy
task
if
the
hartley
boys
had
been
big
and
they
could
scarcely
have
succeeded
in
tearing
away
the
woodwork
from
the
wall
but
they
did
do
it
and
their
labours
were
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
the
fortune
sure
enough
the
historic
poke
was
a
pocket
or
recess
between
the
old
bedhead
and
the
main
wall
it
was
really
built
in
the
chimney
itself
though
not
in
the
flue
but
this
with
its
wonderfully
carved
mantel
was
never
used
for
fires
and
the
fortune
had
remained
undisturbed
in
its
as
the
boys
lifted
away
the
portion
of
the
heavy
oak
that
covered
the
secret
pocket
a
rough
wall
of
plaster
was
seen
and
by
tapping
on
it
sinclair
learned
that
it
was
hollow
shall
we
break
through
he
said
i
feel
sure
the
money
is
there
break
through
of
course
cried
bob
but
wait
a
moment
till
i
lock
the
doors
this
is
no
time
for
intruders
bob
fastened
the
doors
and
then
with
a
hatchet
they
broke
through
the
plaster
and
even
as
the
old
mortar
crumbled
beneath
their
blows
out
fell
a
shower
of
glittering
gold
coins
and
tightly
folded
banknotes
the
sight
was
too
much
for
the
strained
nerves
of
the
watchers
mabel
burst
into
tears
and
cromarty
trembled
like
a
leaf
the
boys
broke
into
shouts
of
joy
and
patty
scarcely
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
but
in
a
moment
they
were
all
congratulating
each
other
and
showering
praises
on
patty
for
her
cleverness
in
the
matter
it
ours
it
ours
cried
bob
it
grandy
to
be
sure
but
it
belongs
to
old
cromarty
manor
and
we
all
cromartys
patty
hereby
adopted
and
made
one
of
us
what
shall
we
do
with
it
asked
the
more
practical
sinclair
i
mean
just
at
present
we
must
take
care
of
it
at
once
you
know
we
leave
it
long
like
this
there
the
old
spanish
chest
said
hartley
indicating
a
affair
that
stood
nearby
put
it
in
that
just
the
thing
said
bob
lend
a
hand
clair
it
was
a
strange
proceeding
the
old
coins
many
of
them
still
bright
though
of
far
back
dates
represented
a
great
deal
of
money
how
much
they
could
not
guess
as
yet
but
it
was
surely
a
large
sum
also
there
were
bank
of
england
notes
folded
small
that
they
might
be
pushed
through
the
openings
in
the
carved
oak
and
as
the
pocket
had
been
carefully
made
the
boys
took
the
money
out
in
double
handfuls
and
deposited
it
in
the
old
spanish
chest
it
will
be
quite
safe
there
until
said
hartley
and
then
we
must
get
it
to
the
bank
but
as
no
one
yet
knows
of
our
discovery
there
can
be
no
danger
of
its
being
stolen
what
ever
made
uncle
marmaduke
choose
this
way
of
concealing
his
fortune
asked
bob
as
he
kept
on
transferring
the
money
from
its
to
the
chest
he
had
a
fear
of
banks
or
investments
said
cromarty
i
often
heard
him
say
he
would
trust
any
of
them
he
said
he
rather
be
sure
of
his
principal
and
go
without
his
interest
crickets
said
bob
if
all
this
been
out
at
interest
for
forty
years
think
how
it
would
have
increased
yes
said
his
mother
but
in
that
case
it
would
not
have
been
hidden
and
before
now
it
might
have
all
been
spent
then
i
glad
the
old
gentleman
chose
this
way
of
banking
and
i
suppose
he
meant
to
leave
full
instructions
where
to
find
it
well
said
sinclair
we
found
it
without
his
instructions
thanks
to
our
patty
and
then
they
all
began
again
to
bless
and
praise
patty
until
she
was
really
embarrassed
at
their
overwhelming
gratitude
we
offer
you
a
share
said
bob
gaily
but
you
already
have
more
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
perhaps
not
quite
that
said
patty
smiling
but
i
have
enough
and
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
your
own
at
last
how
much
do
you
suppose
there
is
asked
mabel
awestruck
as
she
watched
the
boys
still
carrying
their
precious
handfuls
across
the
room
enough
to
buy
you
some
new
frocks
sister
said
sinclair
and
enough
to
fix
up
dear
old
cromarty
as
it
should
be
fixed
up
there
must
be
thousands
of
pounds
said
grandma
cromarty
to
think
of
marmaduke
exchanging
all
his
securities
and
bonds
for
gold
and
notes
i
suppose
he
did
it
while
i
was
away
in
london
he
was
a
most
erratic
man
well
you
see
said
sinclair
thoughtfully
once
he
had
the
place
built
he
could
drop
his
money
through
whenever
he
received
any
i
can
imagine
the
old
chap
after
every
one
else
in
the
house
was
in
bed
standing
here
and
dropping
in
his
coins
one
by
one
and
listening
to
them
clink
why
it
like
a
child
toy
on
a
large
scale
it
a
large
scale
said
bob
whew
i
tired
out
but
it
nearly
all
in
the
chest
now
and
see
grandy
the
chest
is
nearly
full
when
shall
we
count
it
and
how
we
get
this
mess
cleared
away
if
the
servants
come
in
here
they
know
it
all
at
once
and
i
think
we
ought
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
until
we
can
cart
the
gold
away
to
the
bank
i
think
so
too
said
his
mother
suppose
we
leave
this
room
exactly
as
it
is
and
lock
it
all
up
until
then
we
can
talk
it
over
this
evening
and
decide
what
is
best
to
do
i
think
we
should
consult
with
lawyer
ashton
and
let
him
advise
us
so
after
carefully
securing
the
windows
and
locking
all
the
doors
of
the
room
it
was
a
family
who
went
away
to
dress
for
dinner
let
put
on
our
prettiest
frocks
and
make
the
dinner
a
sort
of
celebration
feast
said
patty
who
dearly
loved
an
occasion
we
will
said
mabel
and
grandy
must
wear
her
black
velvet
cromarty
was
easily
persuaded
and
the
happy
old
lady
looked
almost
regal
as
in
her
trailing
gown
she
led
the
way
to
the
the
dinner
conversation
was
on
the
topic
and
patty
realised
afresh
how
dearly
these
people
loved
their
old
home
and
how
anxious
they
were
to
devote
their
fortune
to
restoring
the
glories
of
the
place
and
now
we
can
have
the
garden
party
exclaimed
mabel
you
know
patty
we
had
one
every
summer
for
years
and
years
and
this
summer
we
thought
we
could
afford
it
what
fun
to
have
you
here
to
it
let
have
it
soon
said
sinclair
can
you
get
ready
in
a
week
mother
give
me
a
little
longer
than
that
son
and
we
want
to
send
out
the
invitations
about
ten
days
before
the
party
we
make
the
lists
let
invite
everybody
i
suppose
after
we
put
the
money
safely
away
there
no
necessity
for
secrecy
about
it
no
i
think
not
all
our
friends
will
rejoice
with
us
that
we
found
it
at
last
later
on
they
all
sat
round
the
library
table
and
made
plans
for
the
garden
party
patty
discovered
that
it
would
be
a
much
larger
and
more
important
affair
than
she
had
imagined
the
invitation
list
soon
rose
to
about
four
hundred
and
seemed
literally
to
include
everybody
in
all
the
country
round
i
really
ought
to
have
a
new
frock
for
the
party
said
mabel
but
we
so
much
going
on
that
i
wo
have
time
to
get
one
made
this
gave
patty
an
idea
and
she
determined
to
give
mabel
a
little
surprise
while
they
were
making
the
plans
for
the
fête
she
was
planning
to
write
to
lady
hamilton
and
ask
her
to
send
down
from
london
two
new
frocks
for
herself
and
mabel
to
wear
at
the
garden
party
she
felt
sure
she
could
secretly
procure
one
of
mabel
old
dresses
to
send
for
a
pattern
and
she
meant
that
mabel
should
not
know
of
it
until
the
new
frock
arrived
the
evening
was
a
merry
one
indeed
the
boys
were
so
exuberant
that
they
laughed
and
sang
snatches
of
songs
and
exclaimed
over
and
over
how
much
they
appreciated
the
good
turn
patty
had
done
them
the
two
elder
ladies
were
more
quietly
glad
and
it
did
patty
heart
good
to
see
that
the
sad
anxious
expression
was
gone
from
mabel
face
the
days
before
the
garden
party
flew
by
quickly
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
extra
servants
had
to
be
secured
some
repairing
done
in
house
and
gardens
and
the
caterer
orders
attended
to
the
day
before
the
party
the
dresses
arrived
from
london
lady
hamilton
had
chosen
them
though
patty
had
given
her
a
general
idea
of
what
she
wanted
though
they
were
called
white
muslin
frocks
they
were
made
almost
entirely
of
fine
embroidery
and
lace
mabel
was
worn
over
a
pink
silk
slip
and
patty
over
blue
frenchy
knots
of
ribbon
were
placed
here
and
there
and
when
the
boxes
were
opened
and
the
tissue
papers
torn
away
mabel
gave
a
shriek
of
delight
at
the
beautiful
things
patty
had
wanted
to
give
mabel
a
pretty
frock
but
had
hesitated
to
do
so
lest
she
wound
her
pride
but
this
seemed
different
and
patty
offered
the
gift
so
prettily
as
a
souvenir
of
the
garden
party
that
mabel
accepted
it
in
the
spirit
it
was
given
the
day
of
the
party
was
perfect
just
the
right
temperature
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
blue
sky
except
some
fleecy
little
white
ones
that
were
as
innocent
as
kittens
the
party
was
from
three
till
six
and
promptly
at
three
the
guests
began
to
arrive
there
was
a
continuous
stream
of
carriages
and
motor
cars
and
soon
patty
was
almost
bewildered
by
the
crowds
of
people
although
introduced
to
them
as
they
arrived
she
could
remember
them
all
but
many
of
them
she
had
met
before
and
after
a
time
she
and
mabel
were
excused
from
the
receiving
party
and
were
sent
to
mingle
with
the
guests
the
old
place
was
looking
its
best
though
there
had
not
been
time
for
much
work
on
the
gardens
yet
a
deal
of
tidying
up
had
been
done
new
flowers
had
been
set
out
in
the
formal
flower
beds
the
fountains
had
been
repaired
and
put
in
working
order
and
the
shrubs
and
hedges
had
been
trimmed
patty
looking
very
sweet
in
her
lovely
white
dress
wandered
around
indoors
and
out
greeting
old
friends
and
making
new
ones
the
house
was
thrown
open
and
of
course
the
old
which
had
been
replaced
was
scrutinised
with
great
interest
patty
was
lionised
until
she
became
almost
embarrassed
at
being
made
so
prominent
but
everybody
was
thoroughly
glad
that
the
cromartys
had
come
into
their
fortune
at
last
on
the
lawn
was
a
band
of
musicians
in
gay
scarlet
and
gold
uniforms
who
played
popular
music
at
intervals
during
the
afternoon
the
terraces
and
gardens
were
filled
with
groups
of
people
pleasantly
chatting
and
the
ladies
pretty
summer
costumes
added
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
scene
at
four
tea
was
served
in
a
great
round
tent
which
had
been
put
up
for
the
purpose
although
called
tea
the
repast
was
a
substantial
supper
of
various
and
elaborate
viands
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
so
many
sorts
of
salads
and
carefully
constructed
cold
dishes
she
sat
at
a
small
table
with
the
merediths
and
some
other
young
people
you
going
to
stay
here
all
summer
are
you
asked
tom
who
sincerely
hoped
she
was
i
do
know
replied
patty
i
love
to
stay
for
i
happy
every
minute
here
but
my
own
people
are
writing
me
very
urgently
to
join
them
in
switzerland

in
such
delightful
quarters
there
that
they
think
i

it
too
oh

to

a
croquet
club
and
we
want
you
to
be
a
member
i
be
glad
to
if

stay
but
where
are
the
people
going
now
the
guests
had
all
risen
and
were
being
led
to
a
part
of
the
grounds
where
a
platform
had
been
erected
on
this
were
a
troupe
of
entertainers
called
the
pierrots
they
all
wore
funny
white
suits
with
little
black
pompons
bobbing
all
over
them
they
sang
amusing
songs
played
on
cymbals
and
other
instruments
did
some
clever
acrobatic
work
and
for
a
entertained
the
guests
who
stood
about
on
the
grass
or
sat
on
camp
chairs
to
watch
them
at
six
the
guests
all
took
leave
and
the
great
procession
of
vehicles
again
appeared
on
the
driveway
cromarty
and
hartley
received
their
and
patty
and
mabel
invited
a
number
of
the
young
people
to
remain
to
dine
and
spend
the
evening
though
i
sure
we
ca
eat
any
dinner
after
that
very
satisfying
tea
said
grace
meredith
as
she
accepted
the
invitation
in
the
evening
they
all
went
out
on
the
lake
for
a
moonlight
row
several
new
boats
had
been
bought
and
the
young
men
rowed
the
girls
about
the
boats
were
hung
with
chinese
lanterns
which
gave
the
lake
the
appearance
of
a
regatta
or
a
water
festival
then
back
to
the
house
for
a
dance
in
the
great
hall
the
musicians
had
remained
and
to
their
inspiriting
strains
the
young
people
glided
about
in
merry
measures
do
give
me
another
waltz
tom
meredith
begged
of
patty
i
be
glad
to
tom
said
patty
frankly
but
i
ca
do
it
without
offending
somebody
else
i
love
to
dance
with
you
but
you
had
three
already
and
i
promised
all
the
rest
but
tom
wheedled
hartley
into
allowing
one
more
extra
after
the
last
dance
and
he
claimed
patty
for
that
you
the
best
dancer
i
ever
saw
said
tom
as
they
floated
away
you
the
best
english
dancer
i
ever
saw
laughed
patty
for
she
well
knew
english
people
do
not
dance
like
americans
tom
mind
her
implication
and
after
the
waltz
was
ended
he
led
her
out
on
the
terrace
to
sit
down
for
a
bit
and
rest
there
were
several
others
there
the
hartley
boys
among
them
and
soon
they
began
to
sing
songs
others
came
and
joined
them
and
the
young
voices
rose
in
merry
choruses
and
glees
you
have
splendid
songs
in
england
said
patty
after
the
men
voices
had
come
out
strong
in
hearts
of
oak
and
rule
britannia
yes
we
have
agreed
tom
but
patty
wo
you
sing
something
alone
do
chorused
the
rest
and
mabel
said
sing
that
newest
song
that
you
and
sinclair
made
moon
song
asked
patty
yes
this
is
just
the
night
for
it
the
moon
was
nearing
the
western
horizon
and
its
soft
light
fell
across
the
lake
in
silver
ripples
truly
it
was
just
the
time
and
place
to
sing
the
pretty
song
of
which
patty
had
composed
the
words
and
sinclair
had
set
them
to
music
it
was
a
simple
air
but
full
of
soft
lingering
cadences
and
without
accompaniment
patty
really
sweet
voice
sounded
exquisite
as
it
thrilled
through
the
summer
evening
air
the
song
was
called
the
minstrel
moon
and
the
words
were
these
i
wonder
if
the
moon
could
sing
on
a
marvellous
mystical
night
in
spring
i
wonder
what
the
song
would
be
that
the
minstrel
moon
would
sing
to
me
and
as
i
think
i
seem
to
know
how
the
music
of
the
moon
would
go
it
would
be
a
mystic
murmuring
strain
like
the
falling
of
fairy
rain
just
a
soft
and
silvery
song
that
would
swing
and
swirl
along
not
a
word
could
be
heard
but
a
lingering
just
a
melody
low
and
sweet
just
a
harmony
faint
and
fleet
just
a
croon
of
a
tune
is
the
music
of
the
moon
chapter
xx
one
beautiful
morning
about
a
week
after
the
garden
party
patty
lay
in
her
favourite
hammock
out
under
the
trees
she
liked
this
hammock
especially
for
from
it
she
could
see
both
terraces
the
formal
gardens
and
the
lake
beyond
as
she
looked
around
this
morning
she
could
see
the
workmen
busily
engaged
in
restoring
the
gardens
to
their
original
symmetry
and
beauty
the
hartleys
were
by
no
means
purse
proud
or
ostentatious
and
their
sudden
acquisition
of
a
great
fortune
in
no
way
changed
their
simple
pleasant
attitude
toward
life
but
they
were
now
enabled
to
live
in
their
dear
old
home
without
financial
anxieties
and
moreover
were
able
to
repair
and
restore
its
appointments
but
though
patty
loved
to
let
her
idle
gaze
roam
over
the
attractive
landscape
her
thoughts
just
now
were
far
away
she
had
in
her
hand
a
letter
from
her
father
and
its
message
was
strongly
in
favour
of
her
leaving
cromarty
manor
and
joining
her
parents
in
switzerland
it
was
for
patty
to
make
choice
but
both
nan
and
fairfield
urged
the
plan
they
proposed
so
patty
was
thinking
it
over
she
was
very
happy
at
cromarty
and
the
life
was
quiet
and
pleasant
and
interspersed
with
many
little
gaieties
but
she
thought
herself
it
was
a
pity
not
to
travel
about
and
see
sights
and
places
when
opportunity
presented
itself
as
she
lay
thinking
she
saw
a
large
motorcar
coming
along
the
drive
through
the
park
she
jumped
out
of
the
hammock
and
started
toward
the
house
in
order
to
greet
the
guests
whoever
they
might
be
as
the
car
came
nearer
she
saw
a
lady
and
gentleman
in
the
tonneau
but
so
concealed
were
they
by
their
she
could
not
recognise
them
as
they
drew
nearer
the
lady
waved
her
hand
and
seeing
the
familiar
gesture
patty
at
once
realised
that
it
was
lady
hamilton
her
father
was
with
her
and
patty
ran
to
meet
them
and
reached
the
steps
of
the
great
entrance
of
cromarty
just
as
the
car
swung
round
the
last
curve
of
the
road
oh
kitty
cried
patty
i
glad
to
see
you
where
did
you
come
from
why
did
you
tell
me
you
were
coming
how
do
you
do
sir
otho
this
is
indeed
a
surprise
how
are
you
my
dear
child
said
sir
otho
markleham
after
patty
had
released
lady
kitty
from
her
enthusiastic
embrace
and
turned
to
shake
hands
with
her
father
come
in
said
patty
dancing
about
in
her
excited
glee
come
right
in
you
are
welcome
to
cromarty
manor
and
in
a
moment
the
family
will
also
tell
you
so
what
a
delightful
house
said
lady
hamilton
pausing
to
admire
the
stately
old
portal
yes
is
it
you
know
the
hartleys
do
you
slightly
i
be
glad
to
see
them
again
but
of
course
we
came
to
see
you
and
it
a
lovely
surprise
are
you
staying
near
here
only
for
a
day
or
two
said
sir
otho
we
taking
a
little
jaunt
about
and
as
kitty
wanted
to
see
you
especially
we
came
in
this
direction
the
chauffeur
and
the
big
touring
car
were
put
in
charge
of
the
cromarty
coachman
and
patty
ushered
her
guests
into
the
house
the
ladies
soon
appeared
and
with
hospitable
welcome
insisted
that
sir
otho
and
his
daughter
should
remain
for
a
few
days
this
they
were
unable
to
do
but
it
was
finally
decided
that
they
should
stay
the
night
and
resume
their
trip
the
next
day
and
said
sir
otho
it
may
seem
a
rather
sudden
proceeding
but
we
want
to
take
patty
with
us
take
patty
exclaimed
mabel
aghast
for
how
long
you
tell
her
said
sir
otho
smiling
at
his
daughter
i
have
the
courage
i
explain
later
said
lady
hamilton
but
now
i
want
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
this
grand
old
place
is
this
the
celebrated
apartment
where
the
fortune
was
hidden
yes
said
patty
who
had
written
to
lady
kitty
about
the
matter
and
here
is
the
old
you
can
imagine
lady
hamilton
said
hartley
the
deep
debt
of
gratitude
we
are
under
to
our
dear
patty
you
must
be
indeed
but
i
know
patty
is
quite
as
glad
that
she
made
the
discovery
as
you
are
yourselves
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
devoted
to
showing
the
visitors
about
the
place
sir
otho
was
greatly
interested
in
the
plans
for
the
restoration
of
the
gardens
and
both
he
and
lady
kitty
were
enraptured
with
the
historic
treasures
of
the
old
house
after
luncheon
lady
hamilton
unfolded
her
plans
to
patty
i
have
been
in
correspondence
with
and
fairfield
she
said
and
we
concluded
that
we
must
have
patty
back
with
us
again
she
has
been
very
happy
here
i
know
but
she
has
made
you
a
long
visit
and
really
been
sent
down
here
to
kidnap
her
patty
smiled
but
the
others
did
cromarty
and
hartley
looked
truly
sorry
and
mabel
had
to
struggle
to
keep
her
tears
back
you
are
right
said
cromarty
at
last
we
have
enjoyed
having
patty
here
more
than
i
can
tell
you
but
we
must
not
be
selfish
i
know
her
parents
have
been
writing
for
her
to
go
to
them
and
it
is
wrong
for
us
to
urge
her
to
stay
here
but
i
do
want
patty
to
go
away
said
mabel
and
now
she
was
really
crying
i
know
you
do
dearie
said
her
mother
but
i
see
it
as
grandma
does
and
i
think
we
must
let
her
go
perhaps
some
time
she
come
again
oh
i
hope
so
said
patty
smiling
through
the
tears
that
had
gathered
in
her
own
eyes
you
all
been
so
good
to
me
and
i
had
such
lovely
times
the
question
once
settled
lady
hamilton
went
on
to
say
that
she
proposed
to
take
patty
away
the
next
day
of
course
this
redoubled
mabel
woe
but
lady
kitty
was
firm
it
would
be
just
as
hard
to
spare
her
a
week
hence
she
said
and
then
who
would
take
her
to
london
if
she
goes
with
us
we
will
keep
her
with
us
for
the
rest
of
our
motor
tour
about
a
week
and
then
reach
london
about
the
first
of
july
after
that
patty
and
i
will
join
and
fairfield
in
switzerland
and
go
on
to
do
some
further
travelling
although
patty
was
sorry
to
leave
cromarty
this
plan
did
sound
delightful
and
she
was
glad
that
it
was
all
settled
for
her
and
she
had
no
further
responsibility
in
the
matter
lady
hamilton
had
a
genius
for
despatch
and
she
superintended
the
packing
of
patty
clothes
and
belongings
that
same
afternoon
except
for
the
luggage
needed
on
the
everything
was
to
be
sent
to
lady
kitty
home
in
london
and
patty
had
to
smile
as
she
realised
that
her
present
temporary
home
was
the
great
house
where
she
had
so
daringly
braved
the
irascible
sir
otho
there
was
a
daintily
furnished
room
in
the
markleham
house
that
had
been
set
aside
for
patty
very
own
and
whenever
she
cared
to
she
was
invited
to
occupy
it
when
the
boys
came
home
that
afternoon
and
heard
the
news
they
set
up
a
wail
of
woe
that
was
both
genuine
and
very
noisy
no
one
could
help
admiring
lady
kitty
but
sinclair
and
bob
felt
as
if
she
were
robbing
their
household
and
it
required
all
their
good
manners
to
hide
their
feeling
of
resentment
but
they
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
and
bob
said
well
since
patty
must
go
we
have
to
send
her
off
in
a
blaze
of
glory
let
make
a
party
mother
a
few
people
to
dinner
and
some
more
for
the
evening
hartley
quickly
realised
that
this
would
be
the
best
way
to
tide
over
a
sad
occasion
and
she
agreed
the
merediths
and
a
few
others
were
sent
for
to
come
to
dinner
and
a
dozen
or
more
young
people
asked
for
a
little
dance
in
the
evening
notwithstanding
her
unwelcome
errand
lady
kitty
fitted
right
into
the
house
party
and
both
she
and
her
father
were
so
affable
and
pleasant
that
the
hartleys
forgave
them
for
stealing
patty
away
the
tourists
had
luggage
with
them
so
were
able
to
don
attire
suitable
to
the
party
lady
hamilton
wore
one
of
her
beautiful
trailing
lace
gowns
which
had
won
for
her
patty
name
of
the
white
lady
patty
too
wore
a
white
frock
of
ruffled
organdie
with
touches
of
pale
green
velvet
in
her
pretty
hair
was
a
single
pink
rose
and
as
she
arranged
it
she
felt
a
pang
as
she
thought
that
might
be
the
last
flower
she
would
ever
wear
from
the
dear
old
cromarty
rose
garden
the
dinner
was
a
beautiful
feast
indeed
the
table
sparkled
with
the
old
silver
and
glass
that
had
belonged
to
the
cromarty
ancestors
flowers
were
everywhere
and
the
table
and
were
lighted
entirely
by
wax
candles
with
the
intent
of
abiding
by
the
old
traditions
of
the
manor
at
patty
plate
was
a
multitude
of
gifts
how
they
managed
it
on
such
short
notice
she
never
knew
but
every
one
of
the
family
and
most
of
the
guests
gave
her
a
parting
souvenir
grandma
cromarty
gave
her
a
valuable
old
miniature
that
had
long
been
in
her
historic
collection
hartley
gave
her
an
exquisite
fan
painted
by
a
celebrated
artist
mabel
gave
her
a
ring
set
with
a
beautiful
pearl
and
the
boys
together
gave
her
a
splendid
set
of
dickens
works
in
elaborately
gilded
binding
grace
meredith
brought
her
a
bangle
and
tom
a
quaint
candlestick
and
many
other
guests
brought
pretty
or
curious
trifles
patty
was
overwhelmed
at
this
unexpected
kindness
and
opened
parcel
after
parcel
in
a
bewilderment
of
delight
everybody
was
gay
and
merry
yet
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
sadness
as
one
after
another
remembered
this
was
the
last
time
they
would
see
pretty
patty
after
dinner
they
all
assembled
on
the
terrace
and
the
other
guests
arriving
later
joined
them
there
but
the
soft
beauty
of
the
summer
evening
seemed
to
intensify
the
spirit
of
sadness
and
all
were
glad
to
hear
the
strains
of
a
violin
coming
from
the
great
hall
bob
had
sent
for
two
or
three
musicians
and
soon
the
young
people
were
spinning
around
in
the
dance
and
merriment
once
more
reigned
always
a
popular
partner
patty
was
fairly
besieged
that
night
i
ca
she
said
laughingly
as
the
young
men
gathered
around
to
beg
her
favours
i
halved
every
dance
already
i
ca
do
more
than
that
do
halve
this
one
said
tom
meredith
as
he
led
her
away
for
a
waltz
i
must
have
all
of
it
unless
you
sit
it
out
with
me
on
the
terrace
no
thank
you
said
patty
i
rather
dance
i
do
suppose
i
find
another
dancer
as
good
as
you
all
summer
i
hate
to
think
of
your
going
away
said
tom
you
almost
promised
me
you
stay
here
all
summer
i
know
but
i
not
mistress
of
my
own
plans
they
made
for
me
and
you
glad
of
it
said
tom
almost
angrily
you
glad
going
away
from
here
to
go
motoring
in
switzerland
and
all
sorts
of
things
do
be
so
savage
it
is
surprising
that
i
glad
to
go
away
from
any
one
as
cross
as
you
are
tom
had
to
smile
in
return
for
patty
laughing
tones
and
he
said
more
gently
i
do
mean
to
be
bearish
but
i
wish
you
were
going
i
i
like
you
an
awful
lot
patty
truly
i
do
i
glad
of
it
said
patty
heartily
and
i
like
you
too
after
sinclair
and
bob
you
the
nicest
boy
in
england
there
luck
in
odd
numbers
said
tom
a
little
ruefully
so
i
glad
i
number
three
but
i
like
to
be
number
one
well
you
a
number
one
dancer
said
patty
as
the
music
ceased
and
with
that
tom
had
to
be
content
and
now
the
hour
was
getting
late
and
the
young
people
began
to
go
home
it
was
really
an
ordeal
for
patty
to
say
for
she
had
many
friends
among
them
and
they
all
seemed
truly
regretful
to
part
with
her
but
after
they
had
gone
and
only
those
staying
in
the
house
remained
another
surprise
was
in
waiting
for
patty
they
were
gathered
in
the
great
hall
talking
over
for
the
last
time
the
mystery
of
the
hidden
fortune
and
patty
clever
solution
of
it
and
now
said
sinclair
i
a
little
speech
to
make
he
went
and
stood
on
the
stair
across
the
hall
in
front
of
the
old
and
so
just
beneath
the
picture
of
the
fir
trees
the
painting
was
a
fine
one
and
represented
a
landscape
with
firs
in
the
foreground
it
had
hung
there
since
the
days
of
the
earlier
cromartys
and
was
a
valuable
work
of
art
patty
had
always
loved
the
picture
even
before
the
added
interest
of
learning
the
truth
about
the
fir
trees
and
they
all
knew
it
was
one
of
her
favourites
among
the
many
art
treasures
of
the
old
house
i
was
going
to
make
this
speech
when
the
party
was
here
proceeded
sinclair
but
i
did
partly
because
i
feared
it
might
embarrass
patty
and
partly
because
i
like
it
better
to
have
only
our
own
people
here
but
the
speech
itself
is
this
we
the
cromartys
of
cromarty
manor
realising
that
we
can
never
liquidate
the
great
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
our
beautiful
and
beloved
friend
miss
patty
fairfield
wish
at
least
to
give
her
a
token
of
our
affection
and
a
memento
of
her
noble
deed
we
therefore
one
and
all
of
the
household
of
cromarty
offer
her
this
picture
of
fir
trees
this
painting
by
hobbema
and
we
trust
that
she
will
accept
it
in
the
spirit
it
is
tendered
sinclair
bowed
and
sat
down
and
patty
sat
for
a
moment
in
awestruck
silence
then
the
hobbema
she
cried
i
wo
take
it
the
idea
of
giving
me
that
painting
why
it
one
of
the
gems
of
the
house
that
why
we
want
you
to
have
it
patty
dear
said
grandma
cromarty
gently
it
is
one
of
our
treasures
and
for
that
very
reason
it
is
worthy
to
be
presented
as
a
souvenir
to
one
who
so
gloriously
deserves
it
hear
hear
cried
bob
grandy
makes
a
better
speech
than
you
clair
patty
scruples
were
lovingly
overcome
and
she
was
made
to
realise
that
she
was
the
owner
of
a
real
masterpiece
of
art
that
would
be
to
her
a
lifelong
delight
but
what
will
take
its
place
she
said
it
has
hung
there
so
many
years
it
hung
there
said
hartley
until
its
mission
was
fulfilled
now
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
searched
for
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
it
need
hang
there
no
longer
it
is
fitting
that
we
retain
the
and
you
possess
the
trees
thus
assuring
an
everlasting
bond
of
union
between
the
fir
trees
and
the
oak
bravo
mater
cried
bob
you
coming
out
strong
on
speechifying
too
mabel
we
must
look
out
for
our
laurels
but
mabel
was
too
near
the
verge
of
tears
to
trust
her
voice
so
she
slipped
her
hand
in
patty
knowing
that
she
would
understand
all
that
could
not
be
said
well
went
on
bob
i
not
much
of
an
orator
but
i
take
it
for
my
part
to
see
that
the
fir
trees
are
properly
packed
and
sent
to
your
home
patty
where
shall
i
send
the
box
i
hate
to
have
it
go
to
new
york
now
said
patty
for
i
want
it
with
me
while
i
over
here
so
it
was
arranged
to
send
the
picture
to
sir
otho
house
in
london
there
to
remain
until
the
fairfields
returned
to
america
the
departure
from
cromarty
was
made
next
morning
directly
after
breakfast
it
was
fortunate
that
the
last
details
of
luggage
preparations
and
the
packing
of
luncheon
and
so
forth
made
a
bustle
and
hurry
that
left
little
time
for
actual
farewells
and
too
they
were
all
too
sensible
to
mar
patty
last
memory
of
cromarty
with
futile
regrets
so
after
were
said
and
the
party
stowed
away
in
the
big
car
sinclair
started
one
of
their
favourite
nonsense
songs
the
others
joined
in
and
patty
sang
too
and
handkerchiefs
were
waved
and
as
the
car
slid
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
those
who
were
left
could
still
hear
patty
high
sweet
soprano
ringing
back
to
them
