philip
marsham
was
bred
to
the
sea
as
far
back
as
the
days
when
he
was
cutting
his
milk
teeth
and
he
never
thought
he
should
leave
it
but
leave
it
he
did
once
and
again
as
i
shall
tell
you
his
father
was
master
of
a
london
ketch
and
they
say
that
before
the
boy
could
stand
unaided
on
his
two
feet
he
would
lean
himself
as
a
child
does
against
the
waist
in
a
seaway
and
never
pipe
a
whimper
when
she
thrust
her
bows
down
and
shipped
enough
water
to
douse
him
from
head
to
heels
he
lost
his
mother
before
he
went
into
breeches
and
he
was
climbing
the
rigging
before
he
could
walk
alone
he
spent
two
years
at
school
to
the
good
josiah
arber
at
roehampton
for
his
father
being
a
clergyman
son
who
had
run
wild
in
his
youth
hoped
to
do
better
by
the
lad
than
he
had
done
by
himself
and
was
of
a
mind
to
send
philip
home
a
scholar
to
make
peace
with
the
grandparents
in
the
vicarage
at
little
grimsby
whom
tom
marsham
had
not
seen
in
twenty
years
but
the
boy
was
his
father
over
again
and
taking
to
books
with
an
ill
grace
he
endured
them
only
until
he
had
learned
to
read
and
write
and
had
laid
such
foundation
of
mathematics
as
he
hoped
would
serve
his
purpose
when
he
came
to
study
navigation
then
running
away
by
night
from
his
master
house
he
joined
his
father
on
board
the
sarah
ketch
who
laughed
mightily
to
see
how
his
son
took
after
him
do
what
he
would
to
make
a
scholar
of
the
lad
and
but
for
the
mercy
of
god
which
laid
philip
marsham
on
his
back
with
a
fever
in
the
spring
of
his
nineteenth
year
he
had
gone
down
with
his
father
in
the
ketch
sarah
the
night
she
foundered
off
the
north
foreland
moll
stevens
kept
him
while
he
lay
ill
with
the
fever
in
her
alehouse
in
high
street
in
the
borough
of
southwark
and
she
was
good
to
him
after
her
fashion
for
her
heart
was
set
on
marrying
his
father
but
though
she
had
brought
tom
marsham
to
heel
and
had
named
the
day
nothing
is
sure
till
the
words
are
said
when
they
had
news
which
there
was
no
doubting
that
tom
marsham
was
lost
at
sea
she
was
of
a
mind
to
send
the
boy
out
of
her
house
the
hour
he
was
able
to
walk
thence
and
so
she
would
have
done
if
providence
had
not
found
means
to
renew
his
strength
before
the
time
and
send
him
packing
in
wonderful
haste
with
moll
stevens
and
certain
others
after
him
in
full
cry
for
the
third
day
he
had
come
down
from
his
chamber
and
had
taken
the
great
chair
by
the
fire
when
there
entered
a
countryman
who
carried
a
gun
of
a
kind
not
familiar
to
those
in
the
house
ah
phil
heard
them
whispering
as
he
sat
in
the
great
chair
jamie
barwick
come
back
again
then
they
called
out
welcome
jamie
and
philip
marsham
would
have
liked
well
to
see
the
gun
himself
since
a
taste
for
such
gear
was
born
in
him
but
he
had
been
long
bedridden
and
though
he
could
easily
have
walked
over
to
look
at
it
he
let
well
enough
alone
and
stayed
where
he
was
they
passed
it
from
one
to
another
and
marvelled
at
the
craftsmanship
and
when
they
let
the
butt
fall
on
the
floor
the
pots
rang
and
the
cans
tinkled
and
now
one
cried
have
care
which
way
you
point
the
muzzle
but
the
countryman
who
brought
it
laughed
and
declared
there
was
no
danger
for
though
it
was
charged
he
had
spent
all
his
powder
and
had
not
primed
it
at
last
he
took
it
from
them
all
and
spying
moll
stevens
who
had
heard
the
bustle
and
had
come
to
learn
the
cause
he
called
for
a
can
of
ale
there
was
no
place
at
hand
to
set
down
his
gun
so
he
turned
to
the
lad
in
the
chair
and
cried
here
whiteface
with
the
great
eyes
take
my
piece
and
keep
it
for
me
i
am
dry
oh
so
dry
keep
it
till
i
have
drunk
and
gramercy
a
can
of
ale
i
say
hostess
moll
moll
where
art
thou
a
can
of
ale
he
flung
himself
down
on
a
bench
and
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
he
was
a
huge
great
man
with
a
vast
belly
and
a
deep
voice
and
a
fat
red
face
that
was
smiling
one
minute
and
frowning
the
next
ho
hostess
he
roared
again
ale
ale
a
can
of
ale
moll
i
say
a
can
of
ale
a
hush
had
fallen
upon
the
room
at
his
first
summons
for
he
had
been
quiet
so
long
after
entering
that
his
clamour
amazed
all
who
were
present
unless
they
had
known
him
before
and
they
now
stole
glances
at
him
and
at
one
another
and
at
moll
stevens
who
came
bustling
in
again
her
face
as
red
as
his
own
for
she
was
his
match
in
girth
and
temper
here
then
she
snapped
and
thumped
the
can
down
before
him
on
the
great
oaken
table
he
blew
off
the
topmost
foam
and
thrust
his
hot
face
into
the
ale
but
not
so
deep
that
he
could
not
send
phil
marsham
a
wink
over
the
rim
this
moll
perceived
and
in
turn
shot
at
the
lad
a
glance
so
that
any
one
who
saw
it
must
know
she
rued
the
day
she
had
taken
him
under
her
roof
in
his
illness
he
had
got
many
such
a
glance
since
word
came
that
his
father
was
lost
and
more
than
glances
too
for
as
soon
as
moll
knew
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
keeping
his
good
will
she
had
berated
him
like
the
vixen
she
was
at
heart
although
he
was
then
too
ill
to
raise
his
head
from
the
sheet
it
was
a
sad
plight
for
a
lad
whose
grandfather
was
a
gentleman
although
he
had
never
seen
the
old
man
and
there
had
been
times
when
he
would
almost
have
gone
back
to
school
and
have
swallowed
without
a
whimper
the
latin
and
greek
but
he
was
stronger
now
and
nearer
able
to
fend
for
himself
and
it
was
in
his
mind
as
he
sat
in
the
great
chair
with
the
gun
that
after
a
few
days
at
longest
he
would
pay
the
score
in
silver
from
his
chest
upstairs
and
take
leave
for
ever
of
moll
stevens
and
her
alehouse
so
now
giving
her
no
heed
he
began
fondling
the
fat
countryman
piece
the
stock
was
of
walnut
polished
until
a
man
could
see
his
face
in
it
and
the
barrel
was
of
steel
chased
from
breech
to
muzzle
and
inlaid
with
gold
and
silver
small
wonder
that
all
had
been
eager
to
handle
it
the
lad
thought
he
saw
others
in
the
room
furtively
observing
the
gun
and
he
knew
there
were
men
not
a
hundred
leagues
away
who
would
have
killed
the
owner
to
take
it
he
even
bethought
himself
having
no
lack
of
conceit
in
such
matters
that
the
man
had
done
well
to
pick
phil
marsham
to
keep
it
while
he
drank
his
ale
the
fellow
had
gone
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
and
had
taken
a
deep
seat
just
beneath
the
three
long
shelves
on
which
stood
the
three
rows
of
fine
platters
that
were
the
pride
of
moll
stevens
heart
the
platters
caught
the
lad
eye
and
raising
the
gun
he
presented
it
at
the
uppermost
row
supposing
it
were
loaded
and
primed
he
thought
what
a
stir
and
clatter
it
would
make
to
fire
the
charge
he
smiled
cocked
the
gun
and
rested
his
finger
on
the
trigger
but
he
was
over
weak
to
hold
the
gun
steady
as
he
let
the
muzzle
fall
his
hand
slipped
his
throat
tightened
like
a
cramp
his
hair
he
verily
believed
rose
on
end
the
gun
primed
or
no
went
off
he
had
so
far
lowered
the
muzzle
that
not
a
shot
struck
the
topmost
row
of
platters
but
of
the
second
lower
row
not
one
platter
was
left
standing
the
splinters
flew
in
a
shower
over
the
whole
room
and
a
dozen
stray
shots
for
the
gun
was
charged
to
shoot
small
birds
peppered
the
fat
man
about
the
face
and
ear
worst
of
all
by
far
to
make
good
measure
of
the
clatter
and
clamour
the
great
mass
of
the
charge
which
by
grace
of
god
avoided
the
fat
man
head
although
the
wind
of
it
raised
his
hair
struck
fairly
a
butt
of
moll
richest
sack
which
six
men
had
raised
on
a
frame
to
make
easier
the
labour
of
drawing
from
it
and
shattered
a
stave
so
that
the
goodly
wine
poured
out
as
if
a
greater
than
moses
had
smitten
a
rock
with
his
staff
of
all
in
the
room
mind
you
none
was
more
amazed
than
philip
marsham
and
indeed
for
a
moment
his
wits
were
quite
numb
he
sat
with
the
gun
in
his
hands
which
was
still
smoking
to
show
who
had
done
the
wicked
deed
and
stared
at
the
splintered
platters
and
at
the
furious
face
on
which
rivulets
of
blood
were
trickling
down
and
at
the
gurgling
flood
of
wine
that
was
belching
out
on
moll
dirty
floor
then
in
rushed
moll
herself
with
such
a
face
that
he
hoped
never
to
see
the
like
again
she
swept
the
room
at
a
single
glance
and
bawling
as
i
live
is
that
tike
philip
marsham
paddock
hound
imp
at
him
she
came
a
billet
of
flanders
brick
in
her
hand
he
was
of
no
mind
to
try
the
quality
of
her
scouring
for
although
she
knew
not
the
meaning
of
a
clean
house
she
was
a
brawny
wench
and
her
hand
and
her
brick
were
as
rough
as
her
tongue
further
he
perceived
that
there
were
others
to
reckon
with
for
the
countryman
was
on
his
feet
with
a
murderous
look
in
his
eye
and
there
were
six
besides
him
who
had
started
up
although
phil
had
little
wish
to
play
hare
to
their
hounds
since
the
fever
had
left
him
fit
for
neither
fighting
nor
running
there
was
urgent
need
that
he
act
soon
and
to
a
purpose
for
moll
and
her
flanders
brick
were
upon
him
warmed
by
the
smell
of
the
good
wine
run
to
waste
and
marvellously
strengthened
by
the
danger
of
bodily
harm
if
once
they
laid
hands
on
him
he
got
out
of
the
great
chair
as
nimbly
as
if
he
had
not
spent
three
weeks
in
bed
and
turning
like
a
fox
slipped
through
the
door
god
was
good
to
philip
marsham
for
the
gun
as
he
dropped
it
tripped
moll
stevens
and
sent
her
sprawling
on
the
threshold
the
fat
countryman
thinking
more
of
his
property
than
his
injury
stooped
for
the
gun
and
those
two
so
filled
the
door
that
the
six
were
stoppered
in
the
alehouse
until
with
the
ringing
in
his
ears
phil
had
got
him
out
of
sight
he
had
the
craft
though
they
then
came
after
him
like
hounds
let
slip
to
turn
aside
and
take
to
earth
in
a
trench
hard
by
and
to
lie
in
hiding
there
until
the
hue
and
cry
had
come
and
gone
in
faith
he
had
neither
the
wind
nor
the
strength
to
run
farther
it
was
stop
thief
murder
done
attach
the
knave
help
help
who
had
dug
the
trench
that
was
his
he
never
knew
but
it
lay
not
a
furlong
from
the
alehouse
door
and
as
he
tumbled
into
it
and
sprawled
flat
on
the
wet
earth
he
gave
the
man
an
orphan
blessing
the
hue
and
cry
passed
him
and
went
racing
down
the
river
and
when
the
yells
had
grown
fainter
and
at
last
had
died
quite
away
he
got
up
out
of
the
trench
and
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
in
the
opposite
direction
stopping
often
to
rest
until
he
had
left
moll
alehouse
a
good
mile
behind
him
he
passed
a
parish
beadle
but
the
fellow
gave
him
not
a
single
glance
he
passed
the
crier
calling
for
sale
the
household
goods
of
a
man
who
desired
to
take
his
fortune
and
depart
for
new
england
and
the
crier
who
one
would
suppose
knew
everything
of
the
public
weal
brushed
his
coat
but
hindered
him
not
in
the
space
of
a
single
furlong
he
met
two
puritans
on
foot
without
enough
hair
to
cover
their
ears
and
two
fine
gentlemen
on
horseback
whose
curls
flowed
to
their
shoulders
but
neither
one
nor
other
gave
him
let
the
rabble
of
higglers
and
waggoners
from
the
alehouse
headed
by
the
countryman
jamie
barwick
and
by
moll
stevens
herself
had
raced
far
down
the
river
and
phil
marsham
was
free
to
go
wherever
else
his
discretion
bade
him
now
it
would
have
been
his
second
nature
to
have
fled
to
the
docks
for
he
was
bred
a
sailor
and
could
haul
and
reef
and
steer
with
any
man
but
they
whom
he
had
no
wish
to
meet
had
gone
that
way
and
in
his
weakness
it
had
been
worse
than
folly
to
beard
them
his
patrimony
was
forfeit
for
although
his
father
had
left
him
a
bag
of
silver
it
lay
in
his
chest
in
moll
stevens
alehouse
and
for
fear
of
hanging
he
dared
not
go
back
after
it
she
was
a
vindictive
shrew
and
would
have
taken
his
heart
blood
to
pay
him
for
his
blunder
his
father
was
gone
and
the
ketch
with
him
and
save
for
a
handful
of
silver
the
lad
had
about
him
he
was
penniless
so
what
would
a
sailor
do
think
you
orphaned
and
penniless
and
cut
off
from
the
sea
but
set
himself
up
for
a
farmer
phil
clapped
his
hand

quietly
laughed

a
man

skill
for
husbandry

entered
his

head
were
not
husbandmen
all
fond
fellows
whom
a
lively
sailor
man
might
fleer
as
he
pleased
nay
they
knew
not
so
much
as
one
rope
from
another
why
then
he
would
go
into
the
country
and
set
him
up
as
a
kind
of
prince
among
husbandmen
who
had
by
all
reports
plenty
of
good
nappy
liquor
to
drink
and
bread
and
cheese
and
meat
to
eat
with
that
he
turned
his
back
on
the
sea
and
london
and
on
moll
stevens

he
never
saw
again
his
trafficking
with
her
was

ended
and
as
well
ended
his
father
affair

my
belief
for
the
woman

a
bitter
temper
and
a
sharp
tongue
and
there
are
worse
things
for
a
jovial
man
such
as
tom
marsham
was
than
drowning
the
son
owed
her
nought
that
the
bag
in
his
chest
would
not
repay
many
times
over
so
he
set
out
with
all
good
courage
and
with
the
handful
of
silver
that
chanced
to
be
in
his
pocket
and
though
his
legs
were
weak
and
he
must
stop
often
to
rest
by
nightfall
he
had
gone
miles
upon
his
way

set
the
grasses
nodding
and

phil
passed
between
green
fields
into
a
neat
village
where
men
and
women
turned
to
look
after
him
as
he
went
and
on
into
open
country
where
he
came
at
last
to
a
great
estate
and
a
porter
lodge
and
sat
him
down
and
rested
there
was
a
hoarse
clamour
from
a
distant
rookery
and
the
wind
whispered
in
two
pine
trees
that
grew
beside
the
lodge
where
a
gentleman
of
curious
tastes
had
planted
them
a
few
drops
of
rain
beating
on
the
road
and
rattling
on
the
leaves
of
a
great
oak
increased
the
loneliness
that
beset
him
where
he
should
lie
the
night
he
had
no
notion
or
whence
his
supper
was
to
come
but
the
shower
blew
past
and
he
pressed
on
till
he
came
to
a
little
hamlet
on
the
border
of
a
heath
where
there
was
a
smithy
with
a
silent
man
standing
by
the
door
as
he
passed
the
smithy
the
lad
stumbled
the
man
looked
hard
at
him
as
if
suspecting
some
trickery
but
when
phil
was
about
to
press
on
without
a
word
the
man
asked
in
a
low
voice
who
the
gaed
yonder
on
sic
like
and
at
sic
like
hoddin
gait
at
this
phil
sat
down
on
a
stone
for
his
weakness
had
grown
on
him
sorely
and
replied
that
whither
he
was
going
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
whereupon
the
man
whom
he
knew
by
his
tongue
to
be
a
scot
cried
out
hech
the
lad
falling
and
catching
the
youth
by
the
arm
he
lifted
him
off
the
stone
and
led
him
into
the
smithy
phil
found
himself
in
a
chair
with
straight
back
and
sides
but
with
seat
and
backing
woven
of
broad
loose
straps
which
seemed
as
easy
as
the
best
it
is
nought
he
said
a
spell
of
faintness
caught
me
i
be
going
i
must
find
an
inn
i
be
going
now
be
still
ye
na
be
off
sae
soon
the
man
thrust
a
splinter
of
wood
into
the
coals
and
lighting
therewith
a
candle
in
a
lanthorn
he
began
rummaging
in
a
cupboard
behind
the
forge
whence
he
drew
out
a
quarter
loaf
a
plate
of
cheese
a
jug
and
a
deep
dish
in
which
there
was
the
half
of
a
meat
pie
placing
before
his
guest
a
table
of
rough
boards
blackened
with
smoke
a
great
spoon
and
a
pint
pot
he
poured
from
the
jug
a
brimming
potful
of
cider
boiled
with
good
spices
and
fermented
with
yeast
a
wee
healsome
drappy
said
he
an
then
the
guid
vittle
dinna
be
laithfu
raising
the
pot
to
his
lips
the
lad
drank
deep
and
became
aware
he
was
famished
for
food
although
he
had
not
until
then
thought
of
hunger
as
he
ate
the
quarter
loaf
the
cheese
and
the
half
of
a
meat
pie
fell
victims
to
his
trenchering
and
though
his
host
plied
the
jug
to
fill
his
cup
when
at
last
he
leaned
back
he
had
left
no
morsel
of
food
nor
drop
of
drink
now
for
the
first
time
he
looked
about
him
and
gave
heed
to
the
smoking
lanthorn
the
dull
glow
of
the
dying
in
the
forge
the
stern
face
of
the
smith
who
sat
opposite
him
and
the
dark
recesses
of
the
smithy
outside
was
a
driving
rain
and
the
screech
of
a
gusty
wind
it
was
strange
he
thought
that
after
all
his
doubts
he
was
well
fed
and
dry
and
warm
the
rain
rattled
against
the
walls
of
the
smithy
and
the
wind
howled
only
to
hear
the
storm
was
enough
to
make
a
man
shiver
but
warmed
by
the
fire
in
the
forge
the
lad
smiled
and
nodded
in
a
moment
he
was
asleep
cam
ye
far
his
host
asked
in
a
rough
voice
the
lad
woke
with
a
start
from
london
he
said
and
again
he
nodded
the
man
ran
his
fingers
through
his
red
beard
god
forgie
us
he
whispered
the
laddie
ha
grapit
a
the
way
frae
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
led
phil
to
a
kind
of
bed
in
the
darkest
corner
behind
the
forge
and
covered
him
and
left
him
there
going
to
the
door
he
looked
out
into
the
rain
and
stood
so
for
a
long
time
two
boys
scurrying
past
in
the
rain
saw
him
standing
there
against
the
dim
light
of
the
lanthorn
and
hooted
in
derision
the
wind
swept
away
their
voices
so
that
the
words
were
lost
but
one
stooped
and
picking
up
a
stone
flung
it
at
the
smithy
it
struck
the
lintel
above
the
man
head
and
the
boys
with
a
squeal
of
glee
vanished
into
the
rain
and
darkness
the
blood
rushed
to
the
man
face
and
his
hand
slipped
under
the
great
leathern
apron
that
he
wore
by
morning
the
storm
was
gone
the
air
was
clean
and
cool
and
though
puddles
of
water
stood
by
the
way
the
road
had
so
far
dried
as
to
give
good
footing
all
this
philip
marsham
saw
through
the
smithy
door
upon
waking
as
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
he
had
slept
that
night
with
his
head
behind
the
cupboard
and
with
his
feet
under
the
great
bellows
of
the
forge
so
narrow
was
the
space
in
which
the
smith
had
built
the
cot
and
where
his
host
had
himself
slept
there
was
no
sign
the
smith
now
stood
in
the
door
na
na
he
was
saying
is
pitch
an
pay
siller
or
nought
for
the
ance
ye
hae
very
foully
deceived
me
ye
shall
hae
my
wark
for
siller
or
an
ye
like
a
volley
of
rough
laughter
came
booming
into
the
smithy
and
then
a
clatter
of
hoofs
as
the
man
without
rode
away
but
the
face
of
the
smith
was
hot
as
flame
when
he
turned
to
the
forge
and
as
he
thrust
his
fingers
through
his
red
beard
an
angry
light
was
in
his
eyes
reaching
for
the
handle
of
the
bellows
he
blew
the
fire
so
fiercely
that
the
rockstaff
and
the
whole
frame
swayed
and
creaked
he
then
took
up
a
bar
of
metal
and
breaking
it
on
the
anvil
with
a
great
blow
of
the
sledge
studied
the
grey
surface
and
smiled
he
thrust
the
bar
into
the
white
coals
and
with
the
slicer
he
clapped
the
coals
about
it
now
drawing
out
the
bar
a
little
way
to
see
how
it
was
taking
its
heat
and
now
thrusting
it
quickly
back
again
he
brought
it
to
the
colour
of
white
flame
and
snatching
it
out
with
his
pliers
and
laying
it
on
the
face
of
the
anvil
he
shaped
it
with
blow
after
blow
of
the
hand
hammer
thrust
it
again
into
the
coals
and
blew
up
the
fire
again
laid
it
on
the
anvil
and
smiting
it
until
the
sparks
flew
in
showers
worked
it
with
a
deftness
marvellous
in
the
eyes
of
the
lad
who
sat
agape
at
the
fury
of
his
strokes
into
the
shape
of
a
dagger
or
dirk
at
last
heating
it
in
the
coals
to
the
redness
of
blood
and
throwing
it
on
the
floor
to
cool
he
paced
the
smithy
muttering
to
himself
after
a
time
he
took
it
up
again
and
with
the
files
in
their
order
the
rough
the
bastard
the
fine
and
the
smooth
worked
it
down
now
trying
the
surface
with
fingertips
now
plying
his
file
as
if
the
devil
were
at
his
elbow
and
his
soul
salvation
depended
upon
haste
until
the
shape
and
surface
pleased
him
he
then
thrust
it
again
into
the
coals
and
blew
up
the
fire
softly
watching
the
metal
with
great
care
till
it
came
to
heat
when
he
quenched
it
in
a
butt
of
water
and
laying
it
on
the
bench
rubbed
it
with
a
whetstone
until
the
black
scurf
was
gone
and
the
metal
was
bright
again
he
laid
it
in
the
coals
and
slowly
heated
it
watching
with
even
greater
care
while
the
steel
turned
to
the
colour
of
light
gold
and
to
the
colour
of
dark
gold
then
with
a
deft
turn
of
the
pliers
he
snatched
it
out
and
thrust
it
deep
into
the
water
as
he
had
worked
his
angry
haste
had
subsided
and
now
drawing
out
the
metal
he
studied
it
closely
and
smiled
then
he
looked
up
and
meeting
the
eyes
of
philip
marsham
who
had
sat
for
an
hour
watching
him
he
gave
a
great
start
and
cried
god
forgie
us
i
hae
clean
forgot
the
lad
laying
aside
his
work
he
pushed
before
the
chair
the
table
he
had
used
the
night
before
placed
on
it
a
bowl
and
a
spoon
and
setting
a
small
kettle
on
the
forge
blew
up
the
fire
until
the
kettle
steamed
he
then
poured
porridge
from
the
kettle
into
the
bowl
and
bringing
from
the
cupboard
a
second
nodded
at
the
lad
and
as
an
afterthought
remarked
there
a
barrel
o
water
ahint
the
smiddy
an
ye
rising
phil
went
out
and
found
the
barrel
into
which
he
thrust
head
and
hands
to
his
great
refreshment
and
returning
he
sat
down
to
the
bread
and
porridge
while
phil
ate
the
smith
worked
at
a
bit
of
bone
which
he
shaped
to
his
desire
as
a
handle
for
the
dirk
with
light
taps
of
the
he
drove
it
into
place
and
bound
it
fast
with
ferules
chosen
from
a
box
under
the
cot
he
then
sat
looking
a
long
time
at
phil
nodded
smiled
ran
his
fingers
through
his
beard
smiled
again
and
with
a
fine
tool
fell
to
working
on
the
ferules
there
had
been
a
friendly
look
in
the
lad
eyes
and
of
friendly
looks
the
smith
had
got
few
in
england
people
bought
his
work
because
he
was
a
master
craftsman
but
the
country
folk
of
england
had
little
love
for
the
scots
who
came
south
in
king
james
time
and
after
and
a
man
had
need
to
look
sharp
lest
he
fall
victim
to
theft
or
worse
than
theft
he
stopped
and
again
looked
at
his
guest
ran
his
fingers
through
his
beard
and
demanded
suddenly
thy
name
laddie
philip
marsham
ye
spell
it
out
for
me
this
phil
did
after
working
a
while
longer
he
said
as
if
in
afterthought
ye
bide
wi
me
a
while
no
i
must
be
on
my
way
the
man
sighed
heavily
but
said
only
i
hae
a
likin
to
ye
rising
the
lad
thrust
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
stood
as
if
to
take
his
leave
na
na
dinna
haste
i
ask
ye
to
gie
me
help
wi
a
bit
that
yet
to
be
done
the
smith
turned
his
work
over
and
over
he
had
made
a
dirk
with
a
handle
of
bone
bound
with
silver
and
as
he
turned
it
he
examined
it
with
utmost
care
do
he
said
at
last
and
noo
for
the
wark
that
takes
twa
pair
o
hands
he
pointed
to
a
great
grindstone
that
will
a
guid
edge
win
maun
forge
thick
an
grind
thin
sitting
down
at
the
grindstone
the
lad
began
to
turn
it
while
the
smith
now
dashing
water
over
it
now
putting
both
hands
to
the
work
ground
the
dirk
an
hour
passed
and
a
second
with
no
sound
save
the
whir
of
steel
on
stone
and
now
and
again
the
muttered
words
that
will
a
guid
edge
win
maun
forge
thick
an
grind
thin
leaning
back
at
last
he
said
is
done
an
such
wark
is
better
suited
to
a
man
o
speerit
than
priggin
farriery
he
tried
the
edge
with
his
thumb
and
smiled
from
a
chip
he
sliced
a
thin
circular
shaving
that
went
with
and
across
and
against
the
grain
laying
a
bit
of
iron
on
a
board
he
cut
it
clean
in
two
with
the
dirk
and
the
edge
showed
neither
nick
nor
mark
phil
rose
now
and
drew
from
inside
his
shirt
his
small
pouch
of
silver
i
pay
the
score
he
said
the
scot
stared
at
him
as
if
he
would
not
believe
his
ears
then
got
up
as
if
to
thrust
the
dirk
between
the
lad
ribs
those
are
very
foul
words
he
said
thickly
nae
penny
nor
plack

take
and
were
ye
a
man
bearded
i
leave
ye
a
pudding
for
the
the
lad
reddened
and
stammered
i
i
why
i
give
you
thanks
and
ask
your
pardon
the
smith
drew
himself
up
and
was
about
to
speak
harshly
but
he
saw
the
lad
eyes
filling
and
knew
no
harm
was
intended
he
caught
his
breath
and
bit
his
beard
is
an
forgot
he
cried
i
hae
a
likin
to
ye
an
here
my
hand
o
i
hae
made

the
dirk
for
a
gift

ane
sheath
for
i
no

mate
to

with
that
he
drew
out
his
dirk
sheath
and
all
and
placing
the
new
blade
in
the
old
leather
handed
it
to
the
lad
saying
is
wrought
o
damascus
steel
and
there
not
twa
smiths
in
england
could
ye
the
like
so
with
few
words
but
with
warm
friendliness
they
parted
and
philip
marsham
went
away
over
the
heath
wondering
how
a
scottish
smith
came
to
be
dwelling
so
many
long
leagues
south
of
the
border
in
those
days
there
were
many
scots
to
be
found
in
england
who
had
sought
long
since
to
better
their
fortunes
by
following
at
the
heels
of
their
royal
countryman
but
he
had
chanced
to
meet
with
few
of
them
not
until
he
had
gone
miles
did
he
draw
the
dirk
and
read
cut
in
fine
old
script
on
the
silver
ferule
the
legend
by
colin
samson
for
philip
there
are
those
who
would
say
it
was
a
miracle
out
of
bible
times
but
neither
philip
marsham
nor
i
ever
saw
a
scot
yet
who
would
not
share
his
supper
with
a
poorer
man
than
himself
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
bought
food
at
a
cottage
where
the
wife
did
not
scruple
to
charge
him
three
times
the
worth
of
the
meal
and
that
night
he
lay
under
a
hedge
the
day
thereafter
he
chanced
upon
a
shepherd
with
whom
he
passed
the
night
on
the
hills
and
the
third
day
he
came
to
an
inn
where
the
reckoning
took
all
but
a
few
pence
of
his
silver
so
as
he
set
out
upon
his
way
in
the
morning
he
knew
not
whence
his
supper
was
to
come
or
what
roof
should
cover
his
head
it
was
a
fine
day
with
white
clouds
blowing
across
a
blue
sky
and
all
the
colors
as
bright
as
in
a
painted
picture
and
there
was
much
for
a
sailor
to
marvel
at
the
grass
in
the
meadows
waved
in
the
great
wind
like
running
water
the
river
in
the
valley
was
so
small
and
clear
and
still
that
to
a
man
bred
at
sea
it
appeared
to
be
no
water
at
all
but
a
toy
laid
between
hills
with
toy
villages
for
children
on
its
banks
climbing
with
light
quick
steps
a
knoll
from
which
there
was
a
broader
prospect
phil
came
unawares
upon
a
great
thick
adder
which
lay
sunning
its
tawny
flanks
and
back
but
which
slipped
away
into
a
thicket
at
the
jar
of
footsteps
the
reptile
gave
him
a
lively
start
but
it
was
soon
gone
and
from
the
knoll
he
saw
the
valley
spread
before
him
for
miles
it
was
a
day
to
be
alive
and
though
philip
marsham
was
adrift
in
a
strange
world
with
neither
chart
nor
compass
to
show
the
way
his
strength
had
at
last
come
back
to
him
and
he
had
the
blithe
spirit
that
seasons
a
journey
well
his
purse
was
light
but
he
was
no
lad
to
be
stayed
for
lack
of
wind
and
seeing
now
a
man
far
ahead
of
him
on
the
road
and
perceiving
an
opportunity
to
get
sailing
directions
for
the
future
he
leaped
down
from
the
knoll
and
set
off
after
the
fellow
as
hard
as
he
could
post
the
man
had
gone
another
mile
before
phil
overhauled
him
and
by
then
phil
was
puffing
so
loudly
that
the
fellow
who
carried
a
huge
book
under
his
arm
and
bore
himself
very
loftily
turned
to
see
what
manner
of
creature
was
at
his
heels
although
he
had
the
air
of
a
great
man
his
coat
was
now
revealed
as
worn
and
spotted
and
his
wristbands
were
dirty
he
frowned
bent
his
head
and
pursued
his
journey
in
silence
good
morrow
to
you
phil
cried
and
fell
into
step
beside
him
the
man
answered
not
a
word
but
frowned
and
hugged
his
book
and
walked
the
faster
at
that
phil
bustled
up
and
laid
hand
on
his
dirk
good
morrow
i
say
hast
no
tongue
between
thy
teeth
the
fellow
hugged
his
book
the
tighter
and
frowned
the
darker
and
fiercely
shook
his
head
never
he
cried
was
a
man
assaulted
with
such
diversity
of
thoughts
yet
here
must
come
a
lobcock
lapwing
and
cry
morrow
i
will
have
you
know
i
am
one
to
bite
sooner
than
to
bark
already
he
was
striding
at
a
furious
gait
yet
now
giving
a
hitch
to
his
mighty
book
he
made
shift
to
lengthen
his
stride
and
go
yet
faster
unhindered
by
any
such
load
phil
pressed
at
his
heels
lobcock
lapwing
he
cried
thou
puddling
quacksalver
stopping
short
and
giving
him
a
look
of
dark
resentment
the
fellow
sadly
shook
his
head
that
was
a
secret
and
most
venomous
blow
i
gave
you
good
morrow
and
you
returned
me
nought
but
ill
words
the
shoe
must
be
made
for
the
foot
i
have
no
desire
to
go
posting
about
the
country
with
a
roystering
coxcomb
but
well
as
i
say
i
have
no
liking
for
thy
company
which
consorts
ill
with
the
pressure
of
many
thoughts
but
since
you
know
what
you
know
and
the
devil
take
him
who
learned
you
it
like
it
or
not
i
must
even
keep
thy
company
with
such
grace
as
may
be
yea
though
thou
clappest
hand
to
thy
weapon
with
such
facility
that
i
believe
thee
sunk
to
thy
neck
in
the
quagmire
bogged
in
thy
sin
and
thy
hands
red
with
blood
with
that
he
set
out
again
but
at
an
ordinary
pace
and
phil
wonderfully
perplexed
by
his
words
fell
into
his
step
again
the
fellow
shook
his
head
very
sadly
a
secret
and
most
venomous
blow
th
art
a
devon
man
nay
i
never
saw
devon
the
fellow
shot
him
a
strange
glance
and
shifted
the
book
from
one
arm
to
the
other
and
have
never
seen
devon
never
laid
foot
in
bideford
i
venture
there
was
a
cunning
look
in
his
eyes
and
again
he
shifted
the
book
is
even
so
a
most
venomous
blow
this
wonderfully
poseth
me
after
a
time
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
there
is
only
one
other
way
either
you
have
told
me
a
most
wicked
lie
or
jamie
barwick
told
you
the
fellow
watching
like
a
cat
at
a
saw
phil
start
at
the
sound
of
jamie
barwick
name
i
knew
it
he
cried
he
tell
he
tell
he
told
before
was
he
took
the
tale
to
devon
he
a
tall
fellow
but
i
hox
him
yet
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
though
i
suppose
you
not
believe
that
upon
the
mind
of
philip
marsham
there
descended
a
baffling
array
of
memories
the
name
of
the
big
countryman
with
the
gun
carried
him
back
to
that
afternoon
in
moll
stevens
alehouse
whence
with
good
cause
he
had
fled
for
his
life
and
now
this
stray
wight
with
a
great
folio
volume
under
his
arm
out
of
a
conglomeration
of
meaningless
words
had
suddenly
thrown
at
the
lad
head
the
name
of
jamie
barwick
we
must
have
this
out
between
us
the
fellow
said
at
last
breathing
hard
i
not
bear
the
shadow
longer
come
let
us
sit
while
we
talk
for
thereby
we
may
rest
from
our
travels
you
see
was
thus
and
so
jamie
barwick
and
i
came
out
of
devon
and
took
service
with
sir
john
jamie
in
the
stables
for
he
has
a
way
with
horses
and
i
as
till
my
wits
should
be
appreciated
which
i
made
sure
i
have
you
know
would
be
soon
for
there
are
few
scholars
that
can
match
my
curious
knowledge
of
the
moon
phases
and
when
to
plant
corn
or
of
the
influence
of
the
planets
on
all
manner
of
husbandry
and
further
i
have
kept
the
covenant
of
the
living
god
which
should
make
all
the
devils
in
hell
to
tremble
and
if
england
keeps
it
she
shall
be
saved
from
burning
so
when
i
made
shift
to
get
the
ear
of
sir
john
who
hath
a
sharp
nose
in
all
affairs
of
his
estate
said
i
and
it
took
a
stout
heart
i
would
have
you
know
for
he
is
a
man
of
hot
temper
said
i
if
he
would
engage
a
hundred
pounds
at
my
direction
i
would
return
him
in
a
year
time
a
gain
of
a
fourth
again
as
much
as
all
he
would
engage
quoth
he
is
speech
after
mine
own
heart
a
hundred
pounds
sayest
thou
is
thine
to
draw
upon
and
the
man
who
can
turn
his
talents
thus
shall
be
steward
of
all
mine
estates
but
mind
and
here
he
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
for
he
hath
keen
scent
for
a
jest
shalt
go
elsewhere
to
try
the
meat
on
the
dog
for
i
be
no
laughingstock
and
if
thou
then
shalt
thou
go
packing
bag
and
baggage
with
the
dogs
at
thy
heels
is
a
bargain
now
there
was
that
in
his
way
of
speech
which
liked
me
little
for
i
am
used
to
dealing
with
quieter
men
and
always
i
have
given
my
wits
to
booklearning
and
to
holy
writ
rather
than
to
bickering
but
i
could
not
then
say
him
nay
for
he
held
his
staff
thus
and
so
and
laughed
in
his
throat
in
a
way
that
i
have
a
misliking
of
so
i
said
him
yea
and
took
in
my
own
name
fifty
acres
of
marsh
land
and
paid
down
more
than
thirty
pound
sterling
and
expended
all
of
eight
pound
sterling
for
the
ploughing
and
twice
that
for
the
burning
and
sowed
it
with
at
ninepence
the
acre
and
paid
twelve
pound
for
the
second
ploughing
and
eleven
pound
for
the
fencing
all
this
did
i
draw
from
sir
john
who
to
pay
the
devil
his
due
gave
it
me
with
a
free
hand
and
if
god
had
been
pleased
to
send
the
ordinary
blessing
upon
mine
acres
i
should
have
got
from
it
at
harvest
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
or
even
five
hundred
quarters
of
good
and
what
with
reaping
and
threshing
and
all
at
four
and
twenty
shillings
the
quarter
i
should
have
repaid
him
his
hundred
pounds
threefold
or
fourfold
all
this
by
the
blessing
of
god
should
i
have
done
but
for
some
little
bugs
that
came
upon
mine
acres
in
armies
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
that
came
in
clouds
and
ate
up
my
and
my
tender
young
rape
so
that
i
lost
all
that
i
laid
out
and
sir
john
would
not
see
that
in
another
year
i
ought
god
favouring
me
to
get
him
back
his
silver
i
had
lost
even
as
the
book
says
he
is
a
man
of
his
word
and
crying
that
the
jest
was
worth
the
money
he
sent
me
out
the
gate
with
the
dogs
at
my
heels
and
with
jamie
barwick
laughing
till
his
fat
belly
shook
to
see
me
go
for
i
was
always
in
terror
of
the
dogs
which
are
great
tall
beasts
that
delight
to
bark
and
snap
at
me
and
the
last
word
to
greet
my
ears
ere
i
thought
they
would
have
torn
me
limb
from
limb
was
sir
john
bawling
at
me
puddling
quacksalver
which
jamie
barwick
hath
told
in
bideford
making
thereby
such
mirth
that
i
can
no
longer
abide
there
but
must
needs
flit
about
the
country
and
lo
even
thou
who
by
speech
and
coat
are
not
of
this
country
at
all
dost
challenge
me
by
the
very
words
he
used
phil
lay
meditating
on
the
queer
fate
that
had
placed
those
words
in
his
mouth
who
he
said
at
last
is
this
sir
john
is
sir
john
the
fellow
turned
and
looked
at
him
you
have
come
from
farther
than
i
thought
not
to
know
sir
john
bristol
sir
john
bristol
i
can
not
say
i
have
heard
that
name
hast
never
heard
of
sir
john
bristol
in
faith
thou
art
indeed
a
stranger
hereabouts
he
is
a
harsh
man
withal
and
doubtless
my
ill
harvest
was
the
judgment
of
god
upon
me
for
hiring
myself
to
serve
a
cruel
blasphemous
knight
who
upholdeth
episcopacy
and
the
common
prayer
book
and
whom
asked
the
lad
do
you
serve
now
ah
i
who
would
make
a
skillful
faithful
careful
steward
am
teaching
a
school
of
small
children
and
erecting
horoscopes
for
country
bumpkins
so
low
has
that
harsh
knight
jest
cast
me
worth
the
money
quoth
he
but
it
had
paid
him
in
golden
guineas
had
he
had
the
wit
and
patience
to
wait
another
year
the
fellow
closed
his
eyes
tossed
back
his
long
hair
and
pressed
his
hands
on
his
forehead
never
never
he
cried
was
a
man
assaulted
with
such
diversity
of
thoughts
philip
marsham
contemplated
him
as
if
from
a
distance
and
thought
that
never
was
there
a
scarecrow
better
suited
for
the
butt
of
a
thousand
jests
there
were
people
passing
on
the
road
an
old
man
in
a
cart
a
woman
and
two
men
carrying
a
jug
between
them
but
phil
was
scarcely
aware
of
them
or
even
of
the
lank
man
beside
him
so
absorbing
were
his
thoughts
until
the
man
rose
clasping
his
book
in
both
hands
and
running
his
tongue
over
his
lips
his
mouth
worked
nervously
i
must
be
off
i
must
be
off
there
they
are
again
and
the
last
time
i
thought
i
should
perish
ere
i
got
free
of
them
o
o
they
have
spied
me
already
if
i
go
by
the
road
they
have
me
i
must
go
by
wood
and
field
turning
abruptly
he
plunged
through
a
copse
and
over
a
hill
whence
his
very
gait
showing
his
fear
he
speedily
disappeared
and
the
two
men
having
set
their
jug
down
beside
the
road
were
laughing
till
they
reeled
against
each
other
to
see
him
go
chapter
iii
two
sailors
on
foot
as
the
two
men
roared
with
laughter
by
the
wayside
so
that
the
noise
of
it
made
people
a
away
turn
round
to
see
what
was
the
matter
those
who
passed
eyed
them
askance
and
gave
them
the
width
of
the
road
but
to
the
few
passers
the
two
paid
no
heed
at
all
pointing
whither
the
lank
fellow
with
the
book
had
gone
they
roared
till
they
choked
then
they
fell
on
each
other
necks
and
embracing
whispered
together
separating
somewhat
unsteadily
they
now
looked
hard
at
philip
marsham
who
knew
their
kind
and
feared
them
not
at
all
shifting
his
dirk
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
and
so
drawing
his
knees
together
that
he
could
spring
instantly
to
one
side
or
the
other
he
coolly
waited
for
them
to
come
nearer
which
they
did
the
foremost
was
a
fat
impudent
scoundrel
with
very
red
cheeks
and
a
very
crafty
squint
the
other
was
thin
and
dark
less
forward
but
if
one
were
to
judge
by
his
eyes
by
far
the
braver
both
had
put
on
long
faces
which
consorted
ill
with
their
recent
laughter
and
both
it
was
plain
were
considerably
the
worse
for
strong
drink
the
first
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
second
who
gave
him
a
nudge
and
pushed
him
forward
ahem
he
began
huskily
you
see
before
you
my
kind
young
gentleman
two
shipwrecked
mariners
who
have
lost
at
sea
all
they
possess
and
are
now
forced
to
beg
their
way
from
london
into
devon
port
where
god
willing
they
will
find
a
berth
waiting
for
them
they
ahem
ahem
he
scratched
his
head
and
shut
his
eyes
then
turning
hoarsely
whispered
yea
yea
so
far
is
well
enough
but
what
came
next
the
other
scowled
blackly
bear
on
he
whispered
hast
forgot
the
tale
of
calamities
and
wrecks
and
sharks
yea
yea
troubles
my
kind
young
gentleman
have
somewhat
bepuzzled
my
weary
wits
as
i
was
about
to
say
we
have
journeyed
into
those
far
seas
where
the
hot
sun
besetteth
a
poor
sailor
with
calentures
and
nasty
rains
come
with
thunder
and
flash
and
the
wind
stormeth
outrageously
and
the
poor
sailor
if
he
is
spared
falling
from
the
shrouds
into
the
merciless
waves
for
he
must
abide
the
brunt
of
those
infectious
rains
upon
the
decks
to
hand
in
the
sails
goeth
wet
to
his
hammock
and
taketh
aches
and
burning
fevers
and
scurvy
yea
we
have
seen
the
ravenous
shark
or
which
keepeth
a
little
scudding
to
and
fro
to
bring
it
intelligence
of
its
prey
devour
a
shipmate
with
its
double
row
of
venomous
teeth
surely
then
young
gentleman
kind
young
gentleman
you
for
whom
we
have
brought
home
curious
dainties
from
that
strange
and
fearful
sea
will
give
us
a
golden
guinea
to
speed
us
on
our
way
or
if
a
guinea
be
not
at
hand
a
crown
or
sparing
a
crown
a
shilling
or
if
not
a
shilling
sixpence
nought
will
come
amiss
nay
even
a
groat
will
by
the
so
much
help
two
poor
sailors
on
their
way
as
the
two
looked
down
at
philip
marsham
a
score
of
old
tales
he
had
heard
of
worthless
sailors
who
left
the
sea
and
went
through
the
kingdom
came
to
his
mind
it
was
a
manner
of
life
he
had
never
thought
of
for
himself
nor
had
he
a
mind
to
it
now
but
he
knew
their
game
and
which
was
more
he
knew
that
he
held
a
higher
trump
than
they
he
leaned
back
and
looked
up
at
them
and
very
calmly
smiled
how
now
the
spokesman
blustered
dost
laugh
at
a
tale
so
sad
as
mine
i
ha
killed
an
italian
in
my
time
i
ha
fought
prizes
at
half
the
fairs
in
england
his
companion
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
whispered
in
his
ear
nay
he
retorted
angrily
is
nought
but
a
country
fellow
soon
overbear
him
again
phil
smiled
hast
thou
never
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
heard
the
man
at
the
mainmast
cry
liar
a
liar
and
for
a
week
kept
clean
the
beakhead
and
chains
nay
i
be
bound
thou
hast
sat
in
bilbowes
or
been
hauled
under
the
keel
the
marshal
doubtless
knew
thee
well
the
faces
of
the
two
men
changed
the
fat
man
who
had
been
the
spokesman
opened
his
mouth
and
was
at
loss
for
words
but
the
thin
dark
man
began
to
laugh
and
kept
on
laughing
till
he
could
hardly
stand
we
ha
reached
for
a
pheasant
and
seized
a
hawk
he
cried
whence
came
you
my
gay
young
gallant
and
what
are
you
doing
here
why
i
am
here
to
set
myself
up
for
a
farmer
i
had
a
reason
for
leaving
london
again
the
thin
man
burst
out
laughing
why
then
quoth
he
we
are
three
men
of
like
minds
so
had
martin
and
i
a
reason
for
leaving
london
too
and
you
are
one
who
hath
smelt
salt
water
in
your
time
nay
deny
it
not
martin
sails
are
still
for
wind
so
sorely
did
you
take
him
aback
was
a
shrewd
thrust
and
it
scored
why
now
as
for
farming
he
spread
his
hands
and
lifted
his
brows
come
with
us
there
a
certain
vessel
to
sail
from
bideford
on
a
certain
day
and
for
any
such
tall
lad
as
thou
i
warrant
there
be
a
berth
leaning
back
against
a
little
hill
the
lad
looked
from
the
red
impudent
face
of
the
fat
man
to
the
amused
lean
daring
face
of
his
companion
and
away
at
the
hills
and
meadows
the
green
trees
and
ploughed
fields
and
the
long
brown
road
that
would
lead
the
man
who
followed
its
windings
and
turnings
however
far
afield
they
might
wander
all
the
way
across
england
from
the
channel
to
the
severn
he
had
made
port
once
upon
a
time
in
bristol
and
he
remembered
lifting
lundy
island
through
the
fog
a
fair
countryside
lay
before
him
with
the
faint
scent
of
flowered
meadows
and
the
fragrance
of
blossoming
on
the
wind
but
the
sea
was
his
home
and
the
creature
with
the
book
and
the
ranting
talk
of
ploughing
and
planting
had
made
the
lad
feel
the
more
his
ignorance
of
country
matters
a
suspicion
of
which
had
been
growing
on
him
since
first
he
left
the
town
and
port
behind
him
these
were
not
men
he
would
have
chosen
but
he
had
known
as
bad
and
he
was
lost
in
a
wilderness
of
roads
and
lanes
and
hills
and
meadows
and
woods
with
villages
one
after
another
any
port
in
a
storm
any
pilot
who
knew
his
bearings
and
for
the
matter
of
that
he
had
seen
rough
company
before
though
his
grandparents
were
gentlefolk
his
father
had
led
a
rough
life
and
the
son
had
learned
from
childhood
to
bear
with
low
humour
and
harsh
talk
the
lean
man
still
smiled
and
though
martin
was
angry
still
neither
the
lad
nor
the
man
heeded
him
i
could
bear
you
company
but
a
doubt
crept
on
him
when
sober
they
might
be
of
quite
another
mind
nay
say
us
no
buts
i
have
neither
money
nor
gear
for
a
journey
nor
we
come
nay
i
am
not
so
deep
in
my
cups
that
i
do
not
know
my
own
mind
the
man
chuckled
perceiving
that
his
intuition
had
fathomed
the
lad
hesitation
rising
phil
looked
at
the
two
again
he
was
as
tall
as
they
if
not
so
broad
after
all
it
was
only
martin
whose
head
was
humming
with
liquor
the
lean
man
it
now
appeared
was
as
sober
as
he
pleased
to
be
and
if
i
have
no
money
we
are
the
better
matched
they
returned
to
the
highway
where
martin
and
the
thin
man
took
up
the
jug
between
them
each
holding
by
his
forefinger
one
of
its
two
handles
and
together
all
three
set
out
but
the
jug
was
heavy
and
they
progressed
slowly
in
faith
the
day
warm
and
the
road
is
dusty
and
i
must
drink
again
said
martin
at
last
they
stopped
and
set
the
jug
down
in
the
road
you
must
pay
said
the
thin
man
taking
from
his
pocket
a
penny
martin
handed
it
to
his
companion
and
filling
a
great
cup
drained
it
to
the
bottom
he
then
shook
the
jug
which
showed
by
the
sound
that
there
was
little
left
they
walked
on
a
while
then
the
thin
man
stopped
i
take
a
bit
of
something
myself
he
said
he
took
the
penny
out
of
his
pocket
handed
it
to
martin
filled
the
cup
and
drained
it
both
then
looked
at
phil
it
is
tuppence
a
quantum
said
the
thin
man
have
you
tuppence
phil
shook
his
head
and
the
three
went
on
together
three
times
more
they
stopped
the
penny
changed
hands
and
one
or
the
other
drank
martin
speech
grew
thicker
and
his
companion
face
flushed
neither
one
of
us
nor
the
other
said
the
thin
man
with
a
flourish
of
his
hand
is
often
seen
in
drink
there
is
a
reason
for
it
this
time
though
any
chuff
say
i
buy
good
wine
for
a
half
crown
the
jug
and
sell
it
at
profit
for
tuppence
the
can
why
can
not
we
so
we
ha
laid
down
our
half
crown
and
set
out
upon
the
road
to
peddle
our
goods
when
martin
must
needs
drink
for
his
thirst
which
as
the
scripture
hath
it
endureth
forever
quoth
i
every
pot
a
penny
to
him
and
a
penny
to
me
quoth
he
lowering
his
voice
the
thin
man
whispered
to
phil
he
is
a
rare
fool
at
times
then
resumed
in
his
ordinary
voice
quoth
he
thy
penny
for
thee
so
presently
i
to
him
his
penny
for
the
wine
that
i
drink
before
we
have
gone
far
it
comes
upon
me
as
a
wondrous
thrifty
thought
that
the
more
we
drink
the
more
we
earn
again
he
whispered
to
phil
drawing
him
aside
when
i
had
drunk
a
few
cans
which
much
enlivened
my
wits
i
saw
he
was
not
so
great
a
fool
as
i
had
thought
and
resumed
his
ordinary
voice
is
little
wonder
that
all
the
world
desires
to
keep
an
alehouse
or
a
tavern
never
was
there
plainer
example
of
befuddled
wits
passing
back
and
forth
from
one
to
the
other
the
single
penny
the
two
had
consumed
their
stock
in
trade
believing
that
they
were
earning
great
profit
on
their
investment
perceiving
that
the
jug
was
nearly
empty
phil
waited
with
quiet
interest
for
the
outcome
they
stopped
again
in
the
road
martin
handed
the
penny
to
the
thin
man
and
poured
from
the
jug
into
the
cup
there
was
a
gurgle
or
two
and
the
jug
was
empty
the
cup
was
but
half
full
is
not
full
measure
he
muttered
but
let
it
be
he
emptied
the
cup
and
wiped
his
lips
now
said
the
thin
man
his
face
by
this
time
fully
as
red
as
his
fellow
where
thy
store
of
silver
count
and
share
count
and
share
thou
hast
it
pence
and
pounds
martin
eyes
half
closed
and
his
head
nodded
breathing
hard
he
sat
down
beside
the
road
nay
drunk
come
now
thy
purse
and
a
just
division
out
of
a
fog
of
wild
notions
the
befuddled
thin
man
had
pitched
upon
this
alone
that
martin
withheld
from
him
their
common
profit
from
their
adventure
into
trade
he
had
keen
mind
and
strong
will
and
his
head
had
long
resisted
the
assaults
of
the
wine
but
wine
is
a
cunning
powerful
foe
and
not
easily
discouraged
which
by
sapping
and
mining
can
accomplish
the
fall
of
the
tallest
citadel
and
now
although
steadier
on
his
feet
the
fellow
was
nearly
as
drunk
as
his
mate
and
in
no
condition
to
perceive
the
flaw
in
his
own
logic
to
all
this
martin
gave
no
heed
at
all
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
uttering
a
prolonged
groan
cried
thickly
apparently
to
phil
and
did
you
ever
see
a
man
dance
on
air
ah
a
hanging
is
a
sight
to
catch
the
breath
in
your
throat
and
make
an
emptiness
in
a
man
belly
tush
the
thin
man
cried
leaning
over
martin
he
thrust
his
hands
into
pocket
pouch
and
bosom
where
hast
thou
hid
it
he
fiercely
whispered
martin
tried
to
stand
and
fell
weakly
back
but
slapped
the
thin
man
across
the
face
as
he
did
so
in
an
instant
the
thin
man
had
out
a
knife
and
was
pressing
the
point
firmly
against
martin
ribs
over
martin
florid
face
there
came
a
ghastly
pallor
let
me
go
he
yelled
take
away
thy
knife
thou
thrice
accurst
old
goat
i
nought
of
thine
o
tom
to
use
me
thus
basely
and
sprawling
on
his
back
he
wriggled
under
the
knife
like
a
great
helpless
hog
the
thin
man
smiled
to
phil
marsham
his
face
seemed
to
have
grown
like
pictures
of
the
devil
in
old
books
he
held
the
knife
against
the
shrieking
fat
man
breast
and
pressed
it
the
harder
when
martin
clutched
at
his
wrist
then
with
a
fierce
pfaw
of
disgust
released
his
victim
and
stood
erect
pig
he
whispered
see
the
point
of
the
knife
was
red
with
blood
not
worth
killing
thy
thin
blood
would
quench
the
fire
of
a
fleshed
blade
with
that
he
deliberately
spat
in
the
man
face
and
turning
went
off
alone
they
were
two
sober
men
that
watched
him
go
for
the
fumes
of
liquor
had
fled
from
the
fat
man
brain
as
he
lay
with
the
knife
at
his
heart
and
of
their
wine
phil
marsham
had
taken
not
a
drop
striding
away
the
thin
man
never
looked
behind
him
and
still
showing
them
only
his
back
he
passed
out
of
sight
martin
remained
as
pale
as
before
he
had
been
red
he
rubbed
his
sore
breast
where
the
knife
had
pricked
him
and
gulped
three
or
four
times
he
breathed
god
be
praised
he
gone
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
then
cast
a
sharp
glance
at
phil
to
see
if
he
had
noticed
god
be
praised
he
gone
he
hath
a
cruel
humour
he
will
kill
for
a
word
when
the
mood
is
on
him
i
thought
i
was
a
dead
man
the
colour
returned
to
his
round
face
and
the
sly
crafty
look
returned
to
his
eyes
we
find
him
at
bideford
though
and
all
will
go
well
again
he
kill
for
a
word
nay
for
a
thought
but
he
never
bears
a
grudge
against
a
friend
we
lie
tonight
my
lad
with
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
by
dawn
we
take
the
road
chapter
iv
the
girl
at
the
inn
as
they
came
at
nightfall
to
the
inn
whither
martin
had
been
determined
they
should
find
their
way
a
coach
drawn
by
two
horses
clattered
down
the
village
street
and
drew
up
at
the
inn
gate
before
them
there
was
calling
and
shouting
hostlers
came
running
from
the
stables
and
stood
by
the
horses
heads
the
landlord
himself
stood
by
the
coach
door
to
welcome
his
guests
and
servants
unloaded
their
boxes
the
coachman
in
livery
sat
high
above
the
tumult
his
arms
folded
in
lofty
pride
and
out
of
the
coach
into
the
light
from
the
inn
door
there
stepped
an
old
gentleman
who
gallantly
handed
down
his
lady
the
hostlers
leaped
away
from
the
bridles
the
coachman
resumed
the
reins
and
when
the
procession
of
guests
host
and
servants
had
moved
into
the
great
room
where
a
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
the
horses
tossing
their
heads
proceeded
to
the
stable
all
this
the
two
travellers
saw
as
unobserved
in
the
bustle
and
stir
they
made
their
way
quietly
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
when
they
passed
a
dimly
lighted
window
martin
glanced
slyly
around
and
with
quick
steps
ran
over
to
it
and
peeped
in
whatever
he
sought
he
failed
to
find
it
and
he
returned
with
a
scowl
the
two
had
chosen
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
the
stable
and
no
one
perceived
their
cautious
progress
martin
repeated
his
act
at
a
second
window
and
at
a
third
but
he
got
small
satisfaction
as
his
steadily
darkening
frown
indicated
they
came
at
last
to
a
brighter
window
than
any
of
the
others
and
this
he
approached
with
greater
caution
he
crouched
under
it
and
raised
his
great
head
slowly
from
the
very
corner
until
one
eye
saw
into
the
room
which
was
filled
with
light
and
gave
forth
the
clatter
and
hum
of
a
great
domestic
bustling
here
he
remained
a
long
time
now
ducking
his
head
and
now
bobbing
it
up
again
and
when
he
came
away
a
smile
had
replaced
his
frown
she
here
he
whispered
from
now
on
we
a
plain
course
to
sail
without
rock
or
sandbar
they
retraced
their
steps
and
went
boldly
round
the
inn
to
the
kitchen
door
there
were
lights
in
the
stable
and
men
talking
loudly
of
one
thing
and
another
from
the
kitchen
door
which
stood
ajar
came
the
rattle
of
dishes
and
the
smell
of
food
and
a
great
bawling
and
clamouring
as
the
mistress
directed
and
the
maids
ran
with
a
jaunty
air
and
an
ingratiating
smile
martin
boldly
stepped
to
the
door
he
knocked
and
waited
but
no
one
heeded
his
summons
a
scowl
replaced
his
smile
and
he
knocked
with
redoubled
vigour
the
sound
rang
out
clearly
in
the
inn
yard
several
men
came
to
the
door
of
the
stable
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
the
clamour
in
the
kitchen
ceased
steps
approached
a
firm
hand
threw
wide
the
door
and
a
woman
cried
with
harsh
voice
well
then
what
you
have
who
come
to
the
back
when
honest
folk
go
to
the
front
there
was
for
a
moment
a
disagreeable
cast
in
martin
eyes
but
his
facile
mouth
resumed
its
easy
smile
an
it
please
you
mistress
there
are
two
gentlemen
here
would
have
a
word
with
nell
entick
gentlemen
she
cried
with
a
great
guffaw
gentry
of
the
road
i
make
no
doubt
who
would
steal
away
all
the
girl
has
it
little
enough
god
knows
a
couple
of
men
came
sauntering
out
of
the
stable
and
the
kitchen
maids
stood
martin
sputtered
and
stammered
and
grew
redder
than
before
which
she
perceiving
bawled
in
a
great
voice
that
rang
through
the
kitchen
and
far
into
the
house
nell
entick
nell
entick
devil
take
the
wench
is
she
deaf
as
an
adder
nell
entick
here
a
come
to
the
kitchen
door
to
see
thee
his
face
as
red
as
a
reeky
coal
to
kindle
a
pipe
of
tobacco
with
a
shrill
chorus
of
women
laughter
came
from
the
kitchen
echoed
by
a
chorus
of
bass
from
the
stable
and
phil
marsham
stepped
back
in
the
dark
unwilling
to
be
companioned
with
the
man
who
had
drawn
such
ridicule
upon
himself
but
as
martin
thrust
himself
forward
with
a
show
of
bluster
and
bravado
the
click
of
light
footsteps
came
down
the
passage
and
through
the
kitchen
walked
a
girl
whose
flush
of
anger
wondrously
became
her
handsome
face
where
is
the
wretch
she
cried
and
stepping
on
the
doorstone
stood
face
to
face
with
martin
so
is
thou
she
sneered
i
thought
as
much
well
she
suddenly
stopped
perceiving
phil
who
stood
nearly
out
of
sight
in
the
shadow
who
is
that
she
asked
the
mistress
had
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
girls
to
their
work
the
men
to
the
stable
the
same
wench
martin
cried
in
anger
seizing
at
her
hand
hard
words
for
old
acquaintance
and
a
warm
glance
for
a
strange
face
she
snatched
her
hand
away
and
cuffed
him
on
the
ear
with
a
force
that
sent
him
staggering
though
he
liked
it
little
he
swallowed
his
wrath
come
chuck
he
coaxed
her
let
bygones
lie
tell
me
will
he
turn
his
hand
to
help
his
brother
she
laughed
curtly
the
last
time
he
spoke
your
name
he
said
he
would
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
to
pay
the
sexton
that
dug
your
grave
and
would
find
pleasure
in
so
doing
but
that
he
then
let
you
lie
with
never
a
stone
to
mark
the
place
and
if
the
world
forgot
you
as
soon
as
he
the
better
for
him
but
sure
he
could
not
mean
it
he
did
martin
swore
vilely
under
his
breath
from
the
kitchen
came
the
landlady
voice
nell
entick
nell
i
say
go
to
the
stable
she
whispered
and
tell
them
i
sent
you
to
wait
there
she
be
in
better
humour
in
an
hour
time
it
may
be
i
can
even
bring
you
in
here
she
shot
another
glance
over
martin
shoulder
at
the
slim
form
of
phil
marsham
and
went
away
smiling
few
in
the
stable
looked
twice
at
the
two
strangers
in
worn
coats
and
dusty
shoes
who
entered
and
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
for
there
is
as
much
pride
of
place
in
a
stable
as
in
a
palace
there
was
talk
of
racing
and
hunting
and
fairs
and
the
beasts
champed
their
oats
and
everywhere
was
the
smell
of
horses
and
harness
presently
there
came
from
the
inn
a
coachman
in
livery
and
him
they
greeted
with
nods
and
for
he
was
sleek
and
well
fed
and
after
a
manner
haughty
which
commanded
their
respect
he
sat
down
among
them
affably
as
one
conscious
of
his
place
in
the
world
but
desiring
provided
they
recognized
him
as
a
man
of
position
to
be
magnanimous
to
all
and
after
inquiring
into
the
welfare
of
his
horses
he
spoke
of
the
weather
and
the
roads
hast
come
far
a
wrinkled
old
man
asked
aye
from
larwood
the
horses
stood
the
day
travel
well
aye
they
are
good
beasts
but
much
depends
on
proper
handling
it
makes
a
deal
of
difference
who
holds
the
reins
he
looked
about
with
an
air
of
generous
patronage
that
and
their
meat
he
nodded
toward
one
of
the
men
is
well
though
when
at
night
they
are
well
fed
to
fill
the
rack
with
or
wheat
ere
leaving
them
as
i
showed
thee
that
perceiving
it
is
not
pleasant
they
may
lie
down
and
take
their
rest
which
is
in
itself
as
good
as
meat
for
the
next
day
work
a
general
murmur
of
assent
greeted
this
observation
goest
far
another
asked
aye
to
lincoln
a
rumble
of
surprise
ran
about
the
stable
and
the
deference
of
the
stablemen
visibly
increased
hast
been
long
away
aye
six
weeks
to
the
day
it
do
take
a
deal
of
silver
to
travel
thus
aye
aye
he
condescended
to
smile
but
there
are
few
of
the
clergy
in
england
can
better
afford
a
journey
to
the
isle
o
wight
than
the
good
marsham
and
he
is
one
who
grudges
nought
when
his
lady
hath
been
is
wonderful
what
travel
will
do
for
the
ailing
aye
he
hath
visited
in
many
great
houses
and
i
have
seen
good
company
while
we
have
been
on
the
road
phil
had
looked
up
where
is
this
doctor
marsham
home
he
asked
all
frowned
at
the
rash
young
man
temerity
in
thus
familiarly
accosting
the
powerful
personage
in
livery
and
none
more
accusingly
than
the
personage
himself
but
with
a
scornful
lift
of
his
brows
he
replied
in
a
manner
to
tell
all
who
were
present
that
such
as
he
were
above
mere
arrogance
why
young
man
he
comes
from
a
place
you
doubtless
never
heard
of
keeping
as
you
doubtless
do
so
close
at
home
from
little
grimsby
martin
glanced
at
phil
the
name
it
seems
is
thine
own
hast
ever
been
at
little
grimsby
never
and
with
that
they
forgot
philip
marsham
or
at
all
events
treated
him
as
if
he
had
never
existed
is
few
o
the
clergy
ride
in
their
own
coaches
someone
said
with
an
obsequiousness
that
went
far
to
conciliate
the
magnificent
coachman
aye
very
few
he
said
smiling
but
marsham
is
well
connected
and
a
distant
relation
some
years
since
left
him
a
very
comfortable
fortune
not
to
mention
that
in
all
england
there
are
few
better
livings
than
his
there
is
no
better
blood
in
the
country
than
runs
in
his
veins
you
be
surprised
if
i
was
to
tell
you
of
families
connected
with
so
the
talk
ran
presently
a
little
boy
appeared
from
the
darkness
beyond
the
door
and
hunting
out
martin
touched
his
shoulder
and
beckoned
martin
having
long
nursed
his
ill
temper
rose
it
is
time
he
said
yea
more
than
time
with
swagger
and
toss
he
elbowed
his
way
out
past
the
liveried
coachman
but
missing
phil
he
turned
and
saw
him
still
sitting
on
the
bench
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
harness
hanging
on
the
opposite
wall
come
come
he
called
loudly
come
make
haste
where
are
thy
wits
phil
i
say
starting
suddenly
awake
from
his
revery
phil
got
up
and
followed
martin
out
of
the
stable
seeing
no
one
and
so
blindly
pressed
at
his
heels
so
little
heeded
what
went
on
about
him
that
the
sudden
burst
of
laughter
his
absence
of
mind
had
occasioned
passed
unheard
over
his
head
in
the
kitchen
whither
the
boy
led
them
they
found
places
laid
at
one
end
of
a
great
table
and
nell
entick
waiting
to
serve
them
who
gave
martin
cold
glances
but
looked
long
and
curiously
at
phil
marsham
the
mistress
and
the
other
girls
were
gone
the
boy
sat
in
the
corner
by
the
great
fireplace
where
the
roast
had
been
turning
on
the
now
empty
spit
nell
set
before
them
a
pitcher
of
beer
and
all
that
was
left
of
a
venison
pasty
martin
ate
greedily
and
whispered
to
her
and
talked
in
a
mumbling
undertone
but
she
gave
him
short
answers
till
his
temper
flew
beyond
his
grasp
and
he
knocked
over
his
beer
in
reaching
for
her
witch
he
snarled
yea
look
him
in
the
eye
his
wits
are
again
looking
up
phil
met
her
eyes
staring
boldly
into
his
he
leaned
back
and
smiled
for
she
was
a
comely
lass
have
the
two
guests
who
came
tonight
in
a
coach
gone
yet
to
bed
he
asked
how
should
i
know
that
his
question
baffled
her
and
she
looked
at
him
from
under
her
long
lashes
half
perhaps
in
search
of
some
hidden
meaning
in
his
words
but
certainly
a
full
half
because
she
knew
that
her
eyes
were
her
best
weapons
and
that
the
stroke
was
a
telling
one
she
made
little
of
his
meaning
but
her
thrust
scored
he
looked
at
her
again
and
marked
the
poise
of
her
shapely
head
the
curves
of
neck
and
shoulders
the
full
bosom
the
bare
arms
but
his
mind
was
still
set
on
that
other
matter
and
he
persisted
in
his
design
i
want
he
said
slowly
to
see
them
to
see
them
without
their
knowing
or
any
one
knowing
except
you
and
me
here
he
met
her
at
her
own
game
and
he
was
not
so
far
carried
away
but
that
he
could
inwardly
smile
to
see
his
own
shot
tell
they
have
supped
in
the
little
parlor
and
are
sitting
there
by
the
fire
she
whispered
it
may
cost
me
my
place
but
again
she
looked
at
him
under
her
long
lashes
he
gave
her
as
good
as
she
sent
and
she
whispered
come
then
come
martin
gave
an
angry
snort
over
his
beer
but
she
returned
a
hot
glance
and
an
impatient
gesture
with
phil
pressing
close
at
her
heels
she
led
the
way
out
of
the
kitchen
and
down
a
long
passage
stopping
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
she
very
quietly
opened
a
door
and
motioned
him
forward
again
her
finger
at
her
lips
with
her
eyes
she
implored
silence
without
so
much
as
the
creaking
of
a
board
he
stepped
through
the
door
a
second
door
which
stood
ajar
led
into
the
little
parlor
and
through
the
crack
he
saw
an
old
man
with
long
white
hair
and
beard
an
old
man
with
a
kindly
face
mellowed
by
years
of
study
perhaps
by
years
of
disappointment
and
anxiety
the
old
man
eyes
were
shut
for
he
was
dozing
in
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
a
lady
sat
but
only
the
rich
border
of
her
gown
showed
through
the
partly
open
door
the
lad
stood
there
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
a
curious
mingling
of
emotions
in
his
heart
and
head
it
had
happened
so
suddenly
so
strangely
he
felt
that
baffling
sense
of
unreality
which
comes
sometimes
to
all
of
us
he
touched
the
wall
to
make
sure
he
was
not
dreaming
had
he
but
stayed
in
school
as
his
father
had
desired
and
gone
back
to
little
grimsby
who
knew
what
might
have
come
of
it
but
no
he
was
a
penniless
vagabond
a
waif
astray
on
the
highroads
of
england
he
was
now
of
a
mind
to
speak
out
now
of
a
mind
to
slip
like
a
fox
to
earth
his
gay
gallant
of
a
father
was
gone
he
was
alone
in
the
world
save
for
his
chance
acquaintance
of
the
road
which
was
perhaps
worse
than
being
entirely
alone
what
madness
he
wondered
as
he
looked
at
the
kindly
face
of
the
drowsy
old
man
had
led
tom
marsham
away
from
his
home
or
was
it
more
than
a
mere
mad
prank
had
the
manners
of
a
country
vicarage
so
stifled
him
that
he
became
desperate
as
phil
thought
of
martin
drinking
in
the
kitchen
a
wave
of
revulsion
swept
over
him
but
after
all
his
father
had
kept
such
company
in
his
own
life
and
though
he
had
brought
up
the
boy
to
better
things
the
father
reckless
and
adventurous
nature
in
spite
of
his
best
intentions
had
drawn
the
son
into
wild
ways
something
rose
in
phil
throat
and
choked
him
but
the
hot
pride
that
came
straightly
and
honestly
from
his
father
now
flamed
high
he
knew
well
enough
that
tom
marsham
had
had
his
faults
and
of
a
kind
to
close
upon
him
the
doors
of
such
a
home
as
the
vicarage
at
little
grimsby
but
he
had
been
a
lovable
man
none
the
less
and
tom
marsham
son
was
loyal
the
girl
daring
not
speak
was
tugging
at
phil
coat
in
an
agony
of
misgivings
he
stepped
softly
back
closed
the
door
on
a
world
he
might
have
entered
and
carried
away
with
him
the
secret
that
would
have
brought
peace
if
a
sad
almost
bitter
peace
to
two
lonely
souls
he
paused
in
the
passage
and
the
girl
stopped
beside
him
there
was
no
one
in
sight
or
hearing
and
he
kissed
her
such
is
the
curious
complexity
with
which
impressions
and
emotions
crowd
upon
one
that
even
while
the
vicarage
at
little
grimsby
and
his
dead
father
were
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
was
of
a
mind
then
and
for
many
a
long
day
thereafter
to
come
back
and
marry
her
since
he
had
closed
the
door
through
which
he
might
have
passed
this
was
a
golden
dream
to
cling
to
in
hard
times
and
glad
he
thought
for
he
had
caught
her
fancy
as
well
as
she
his
and
she
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
and
being
in
all
ways
his
father
son
he
fell
victim
to
a
kitchen
wench
bright
eyes
at
the
very
moment
when
little
grimsby
was
within
his
reach
as
has
father
had
done
before
him
then
they
walked
out
into
the
kitchen
trying
to
appear
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
martin
perceiving
their
red
cheeks
only
sneered
you
must
sleep
on
the
hay
she
whispered
and
to
martin
i
send
him
word
before
morning
and
give
you
his
reply
so
they
again
followed
the
little
boy
through
the
darkness
to
the
stable
by
a
back
way
and
climbed
a
ladder
to
the
great
mow
and
crawled
behind
a
mountain
of
hay
and
lay
with
their
thoughts
to
bear
them
company
while
men
far
below
talked
of
country
affairs
horses
were
trampling
uneasily
in
their
stalls
and
the
little
boy
was
off
through
the
night
with
a
message
chapter
v
sir
john
bristol
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
at
dawn
cocks
crowed
lustily
near
and
loud
or
far
and
faint
the
blue
light
grew
stronger
and
revealed
the
sleeping
village
and
the
rambling
old
inn
and
the
great
stable
where
the
horses
stood
in
their
stalls
and
pulled
at
the
hay
and
pease
in
the
racks
or
moved
uneasily
about
the
stars
became
dim
and
disappeared
the
rosy
east
turned
to
gold
and
the
dark
hills
turned
to
blue
and
the
village
stirred
from
its
sleep
the
master
of
the
inn
came
down
rubbing
his
eyes
and
yawning
to
the
great
room
where
one
of
the
maids
bedraggled
with
sleep
was
brushing
the
hearth
and
another
was
clearing
a
table
at
which
two
village
roysterers
had
sat
late
the
master
was
in
an
evil
temper
but
for
the
moment
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
the
maids
so
he
left
them
without
a
word
and
went
through
the
long
passage
to
the
kitchen
seeing
there
a
candle
which
had
burned
to
a
pool
of
tallow
still
guttering
faintly
in
its
socket
he
cried
out
at
the
waste
and
reached
to
douse
the
feeble
flame
then
stopped
in
anger
for
in
a
chair
by
the
table
on
which
he
had
rested
his
head
and
arms
the
little
boy
sat
fast
asleep
hollo
the
master
bawled
up
started
the
little
boy
awake
on
the
instant
and
his
eyes
wide
with
fear
what
in
the
fiend
name
hast
thou
been
up
to
this
night
quoth
the
master
in
a
fierce
bellow
the
little
boy
burst
into
tears
he
have
nought
to
do
with
him
he
wailed
was
a
long
way
and
fearful
dark
but
i
went
it
every
step
and
ferreted
him
out
and
gave
him
the
message
and
he
swore
most
wickedly
and
bade
me
tell
the
man
go
to
a
place
i
do
like
to
name
and
bade
me
tell
nell
entick
he
took
it
ill
of
her
to
traffic
with
such
as
that
brother
of
his
cried
the
host
belting
his
breeches
tighter
most
shrewdly
do
i
suspect
there
have
been
strange
doings
hereabouts
where
nell
entick
nell
entick
i
say
nell
entick
his
voice
went
through
the
house
like
thunder
the
sashes
rattled
and
the
little
boy
quaked
down
came
the
hostess
and
in
came
the
maids
all
but
nell

nell

where
nell

i
say

take
the
wench

then
in
came
the
sleepy
hostlers
and
the
coachman

livery
all
awry
from
his
haste
but
not
nell
entick
for
nell
entick
with
apprehensions
having
gone
late
to
bed
and
slept
heavily
had
risen
just
after
the
host
had
followed
him
down
the
passage
and
after
listening
at
the
door
until
she
made
sure
her
worst
fears
were
realized
had
darted
back
along
the
passage
and
out
through
the
inn
yard
to
the
stable
where
as
loudly
as
she
dared
but
not
loudly
enough
to
rouse
the
weary
sleepers
above
she
was
calling
martin
martin
awake
i
say
or
they
all
be
upon
thee
martin
awake
the
host
in
fury
seized
the
little
boy
by
the
ear
and
dragged
him
shrieking
across
the
table
now

quoth
he
of

this
squalling
and
squealing
a

a
ferocious

for
a
long
and
sharp
knife

released
his
victim
and
dashed
knife
in
hand
out
the
kitchen
door
the
household
trailed
at
his
heels
the
sleeping
guests
woke
in
their
chambers
and
faces
appeared
at
curtained
windows
nell
entick
fled
from
the
stable
as
he
came
roaring
but
seeing
her
not
he
mounted
the
ladder
and
plunged
into
the
hay
with
wild
thrusts
of
his
knife
in
all
directions
hollo
hollo
he
yelled
at
dogs
at
and
the
two
sleepers
in
the
far
corner
of
the
mow
as
the
household
had
done
before
them
started
wide
awake
for
the
second
time
since
they
had
met
martin
crouching
in
the
hay
crossed
himself
then
shot
a
scared
glance
at
phil
martin
was
white
round
the
lips
and
his
hands
were
shaking
like
the
palsy
said
he
aught
of
hanging
he
whispered
but
philip
marsham
was
then
in
no
mood
to
heed
his
chance
companion
whose
bubble
of
bluster
he
had
seen
pricked
three
times
what
had
occurred
was
plain
enough
and
the
two
were
cornered
like
rats
but
phil
got
up
on
his
toes
shielded
from
sight
by
a
mound
of
hay
and
squatting
low
got
in
his
arms
as
much
of
the
hay
as
he
could
grasp
bawling
curses
and
thrusting
this
way
and
that
with
his
knife
the
host
came
steadily
nearer
he
passed
the
mound
he
saw
the
two
knife
in
hand
he
plunged
at
them
over
the
hay
with
a
yell
of
triumph
but
his
footing
was
none
of
the
best
and
as
he
came
phil
rose
with
a
great
armful
of
hay
to
receive
the
and
sprang
at
him
thus
thrown
off
his
balance
the
man
fell
and
the
lad
catching
his
wrist
and
dexterously
twisting
it
removed
the
knife
from
his
hand
and
flung
it
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
great
mow
help
treason
murder
thieves
with
his
hand
on
the
host
throat
phil
shoved
him
deeper
in
the
hay
and
held
him
at
his
mercy
but
martin
was
already
scrambling
over
the
mow
and
with
a
last
thrust
phil
left
the
blinded
and
choking
host
to
dig
himself
out
at
his
leisure
and
followed
dirk
in
hand
as
the
two
leaped
down
on
the
stable
floor
the
flashing
dirk
bought
them
passage
to
the
rear
whither
they
fled
apace
and
out
the
door
and
away
they
passed
nell
entick
at
the
gate
her
hands
clasped
in
terror
who
cried
to
martin
he
have
nought
of
you
hard
words
were
all
he
sent
to
phil
she
said
nothing
but
her
glance
held
him
and
he
whispered
i
will
come
back
and
marry
you
she
smiled
you
will
wait
for
me
he
whispered
and
kissed
her
she
nodded
and
he
kissed
her
again
ere
he
fled
after
martin
when
they
had
left
the
village
behind
them
they
stopped
to
breathe
and
rest
leaning
against
a
tree
martin
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
had
i
but
a
sword
he
cried
i
ha
given
them
theme
for
thought
the
scurvy
knaves
it
seems
thy
brother
of
whom
we
were
to
have
got
so
much
bears
thee
little
love
and
phil
smiled
for
this
martin
returned
him
an
oath
and
sat
upon
a
stone
on
the
left
lay
the
village
whence
they
had
come
and
though
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
the
spire
of
the
church
and
the
thatched
roofs
of
the
cottages
were
very
clearly
to
be
seen
in
the
pure
morning
air
smoke
was
rising
from
chimneys
and
small
sounds
of
awakening
life
came
out
to
the
vagabonds
on
the
lonely
road
as
from
the
woods
at
their
back
came
the
shrill
loud
laugh
of
the
yaffle
and
from
the
marsh
before
them
the
croaking
of
many
frogs
martin
shifty
eyes
ranged
from
the
cows
standing
about
the
straw
rack
in
a
distant
barton
in
the
east
to
a
great
wooded
park
on
a
hill
in
the
west
i
will
not
go
hungry
he
cried
with
an
oath
because
it
is
his
humour
to
deny
me
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
he
rose
and
turned
west
and
with
phil
at
his
heels
he
came
presently
to
the
great
park
they
had
seen
from
a
distance
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
with
that
he
left
the
road
and
following
a
copse
beside
a
meadow
entered
the
wood
where
the
two
buried
themselves
deep
in
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
the
sun
was
up
now
and
the
birds
were
fluttering
and
clamouring
high
overhead
but
to
the
motion
and
clamour
of
small
birds
they
gave
no
heed
from
his
pocket
martin
drew
a
bit
of
strong
thread
then
looking
about
he
wagged
his
head
and
pushed
through
the
undergrowth
hare
or
pheasant
i
care
not
which
here
we
shall
spread
our
net
here
and
here
whereupon
he
pulled
down
a
twig
and
knotted
the
thread
and
formed
a
noose
with
his
fingers
here
puss
shall
run
he
continued
and
here
god
willing
we
shall
eat
having
thus
set
his
snare
he
left
it
and
sulkily
for
the
sun
was
getting
up
in
the
sky
and
they
had
come
far
without
breaking
their
fast
so
phil
followed
him
and
they
lay
on
a
bank
with
an
open
vale
before
them
where
yellow
daffodils
were
in
full
bloom
and
nursed
their
hunger
after
a
while
martin
slipped
away
deftly
but
returned
with
a
face
darker
than
he
took
and
though
he
went
three
times
to
the
snare
and
scarcely
stirred
a
leaf
which
spoke
more
of
experience
in
such
lawless
sports
than
some
books
might
have
told
each
time
his
face
when
he
returned
was
longer
than
before
a
man
must
eat
he
said
at
last
and
here
in
his
own
bailiwick
and
warren
will
i
eat
to
spite
him
yea
and
leave
guts
and
fur
to
puzzle
him
but
there
another
way
quicker
and
surer
though
not
so
safe
so
they
went
together
over
a
hill
and
down
a
glade
to
a
meadow
do
thou
he
whispered
lie
here
in
wait
with
a
club
in
his
hand
and
a
few
stones
in
his
pocket
he
circled
through
the
thicket
and
having
in
his
manner
of
knowing
his
business
and
of
commanding
the
hunt
resumed
his
old
bravado
he
now
made
a
great
show
of
courage
and
resourcefulness
but
phil
having
flung
himself
down
at
full
length
by
the
meadow
smiled
to
hear
him
puffing
through
the
wood
off
in
the
wood
wings
fluttered
and
martin
murmured
under
his
breath
presently
a
stone
rapped
against
a
and
again
there
was
the
sound
of
wings
then
the
lad
by
the
meadow
heard
a
stone
rip
through
the
leaves
and
strike
with
a
soft
thud
whereupon
something
fell
heavily
and
thrashed
about
in
the
undergrowth
and
martin
cried
out
joyously
he
had
no
more
than
appeared
holding
high
a
fine
with
the
cry
here
meat
that
will
eat
well
when
there
was
a
great
noise
of
heavy
feet
in
the
copse
behind
him
and
whirling
about
in
exceeding
haste
he
flung
the
pheasant
full
in
the
face
of
the
keeper
and
bolted
like
a
startled
filly
thereupon
scrambling
to
his
feet
phil
must
needs
burst
out
laughing
at
the
wild
look
of
terror
martin
wore
though
the
keeper
was
even
then
upon
him
and
though
he
himself
was
of
no
mind
to
run
he
lightly
stepped
aside
as
the
keeper
rushed
at
him
and
darting
back
to
where
martin
had
dropped
his
cudgel
snatched
it
up
and
turned
cudgel
in
hand
he
was
aware
of
a
flash
of
colour
in
the
wood
and
the
sound
of
voices
but
he
had
no
leisure
to
look
ere
the
keeper
was
again
at
him
when
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
the
keeper
was
the
selfsame
countryman
who
had
brought
the
gun
to
moll
stevens
alehouse
by
the
thames
that
it
was
jamie
barwick
now
the
keeper
barwick
was
at
the
same
moment
aware
of
something
familiar
about
his
antagonist
but
not
until
he
was
at
him
a
second
time
in
full
tilt
did
he
recollect
where
and
when
he
had
last
seen
him
he
then
stopped
short
so
great
was
his
amazement
but
resumed
his
attack
with
redoubled
fury
his
stick
crashed
against
the
cudgel
and
broke
and
ducking
a
smart
rap
he
dived
at
phil
knees
to
this
phil
made
effective
reply
by
dropping
the
cudgel
and
dodging
past
the
keeper
to
catch
him
round
the
waist
from
behind
for
his
arms
exceeding
long
though
they
were
were
just
long
enough
to
encompass
comfortably
the
man
great
belly
and
the
lad
iron
clutch
about
the
fellow
middle
sorely
distressed
him
as
they
swayed
back
and
forth
the
keeper
suddenly
seized
phil
head
over
his
own
shoulder
and
rose
and
bent
forward
lifting
phil
from
the
ground
bodily
then
he
flung
himself
upon
his
back
and
might
have
killed
the
lad
by
the
fall
had
phil
not
barely
wriggled
from
under
him
both
were
on
their
feet
in
haste
but
though
the
keeper
was
breathing
the
harder
philip
marsham
having
come
far
without
food
was
the
weaker
and
as
barwick
charged
again
phil
laid
hands
on
his
dirk
but
thought
better
of
it
then
barwick
struck
from
the
shoulder
and
phil
seizing
his
wrist
lightly
turned
and
crouched
and
drew
the
man
just
beyond
his
balance
so
that
his
own
great
weight
pitched
him
over
the
lad
head
it
is
a
deft
throw
and
gives
a
heavy
fall
but
phil
had
not
the
strength
to
rise
at
the
moment
of
pitching
his
antagonist
which
will
send
a
man
flying
twice
his
length
so
barwick
instead
of
taking
such
a
tumble
as
breaks
bones
landed
on
his
face
and
scraped
his
nose
on
the
ground
he
rose
with
blood
and
mud
smearing
his
face
and
with
his
drawn
knife
in
his
hand
and
philip
marsham
his
eyes
showing
like
black
coals
set
in
his
stark
white
face
yielded
not
a
step
but
snatched
out
his
dirk
to
give
as
good
as
he
got
then
as
they
shifted
ground
and
fenced
for
an
opening
a
booming
holla
holla
came
down
to
them
they
stopped
and
looked
toward
the
source
of
the
summons
but
phil
a
shade
the
slower
to
return
to
his
antagonist
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
barwick
was
coming
at
him
he
leaped
back
and
with
his
arm
knocked
aside
barwick
blow
holla
i
say
ha
done
ha
done
that
barwick
was
a
foul
trick
another
like
that
and
i
turn
you
out
a
crestfallen
man
was
barwick
then
who
made
out
to
stammer
yea
sir
john
yea
sir
john
but
a
poacher
a
poacher
sir
john
and
a
poacher
a
foul
trick
is
a
foul
trick
the
speaker
wore
a
scarlet
cloak
overlaid
with
silver
lace
and
his
hair
crept
in
curls
from
under
a
broad
hat
his
face
when
he
looked
at
barwick
was
such
that
barwick
stepped
quietly
back
and
held
his
tongue
the
man
had
martin
by
the
collar
his
sleek
impudence
had
melted
into
a
vast
melancholy
and
there
stood
behind
them
a
little
way
up
the
bank
phil
now
saw
a
lady
no
older
than
phil
himself
who
watched
the
group
with
calm
dark
eyes
and
stood
above
them
all
like
a
queen
throw
down
those
knives
the
knight
ordered
for
it
took
no
divining
to
perceive
that
here
was
sir
john
bristol
in
the
flesh
thrust
them
points
into
the
ground
good
now
have
on
and
god
speed
the
better
man
to
philip
marsham
who
could
have
expected
prison
at
the
very
least
this
fair
chance
to
fight
his
own
battle
came
as
a
reprieve
and
though
he
very
well
knew
that
he
must
win
the
fight
at
once
or
go
down
from
sheer
weakness
and
want
of
food
his
eyes
danced
the
knight
frown
darkened
observing
that
barwick
appeared
to
have
got
his
fill
and
he
smote
the
ground
with
his
staff
then
barwick
turned
and
philip
marsham
went
in
upon
him
like
a
ray
of
light
three
times
he
threw
the
big
man
by
sheer
skill
and
knowledge
for
the
other
by
his
own
weight
hindered
himself
but
after
the
third
time
the
world
went
white
and
the
lad
fell
he
sat
up
shortly
and
looked
into
sir
john
face
is
the
lack
of
food
he
stammered
or
i
him
as
well
as
him
sir
john
was
laughing
mightily
you
gave
him
full
measure
and
thank
god
you
are
fresh
from
a
fast
or
i
ha
lost
a
keeper
as
for
food
we
shall
remedy
that
lack
two
things
i
have
to
say
one
to
you
barwick
you
attempted
a
foul
trick
i
have
none
such
in
my
service
if
it
happens
again
you
go
and
as
for
you
you
cur
that
would
leave
a
boy
to
a
beating
and
never
turn
a
hand
to
save
him
even
take
you
in
hand
myself
and
with
that
sir
john
flung
back
his
cloak
and
raising
his
staff
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
kept
hold
of
martin
he
thrashed
the
man
till
he
bellowed
and
blubbered
till
his
coat
was
split
and
his
shirt
was
bloody
and
his
head
was
broken
and
his
legs
were
all
welts
and
bruises
help
help
o
holy
mary
saints
in
heaven
help
o
jamie
jamie
jamie
o
sir
kind
sir
let
me
go
let
me
go
sir
john
flung
him
away
with
a
last
whistling
stroke
of
the
great
staff
that
said
he
for
cowardice
and
jamie
barwick
having
already
forgotten
his
own
rebuke
was
broadly
smiling
sir
john
turned
then
and
looked
philip
marsham
in
the
eye
it
was
a
good
fight
he
said
and
smiled
courage
and
honour
will
carry
a
man
far
he
then
looked
away
across
his
wide
acres
to
the
distant
village
for
a
while
he
was
lost
in
revery
and
the
others
waited
for
him
but
he
came
to
himself
with
a
start
and
turned
brusquely
though
not
unkindly
to
philip
marsham
come
now
begone
you
vagabond
cockerel
if
a
farm
is
robbed
from
here
to
the
channel
or
a
hundred
miles
the
other
way
i
rear
the
county
upon
your
track
and
scour
the
countryside
from
the
severn
to
the
thames
i
publish
the
tale
of
you
the
country
over
and
see
you
hanged
when
they
net
you
he
stood
there
looking
very
fierce
as
he
spoke
but
there
was
a
laugh
in
his
eyes
and
when
phil
turned
to
go
he
flung
the
lad
a
silver
coin
phil
saw
the
gesture
and
picked
the
money
from
the
air
for
he
was
quick
with
his
fingers
but
before
he
caught
it
sir
john
seemed
to
have
forgotten
him
for
he
bent
his
head
and
walked
away
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
there
was
something
in
the
knight
manner
that
stung
the
lad
who
looked
at
the
coin
in
his
hand
and
almost
as
quick
as
thought
hurled
it
back
at
sir
john
how
now
cried
sir
john
turning
about
i
take
no
money
that
is
thrown
me
phil
replied
so
sir
john
stood
looking
at
him
i
have
a
liking
for
thee
he
said
and
smiled
but
he
then
it
seemed
again
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
lad
for
he
once
more
bent
his
head
and
walked
away
with
the
lady
who
had
stood
above
them
in
the
wood
as
for
phil
he
did
not
so
lightly
forget
sir
john
he
watched
him
until
he
had
fixed
in
his
mind
every
line
of
his
tall
broad
figure
every
gesture
of
his
hand
and
every
toss
of
his
head
he
then
walked
off
and
when
he
turned
to
look
back
a
last
time
sir
john
was
gone
what
was
that
he
said
of
hanging
martin
whispered
the
fellow
face
was
so
white
and
his
lips
and
his
bruises
were
so
blue
that
phil
laughed
at
him
before
his
eyes
who
thereupon
lost
his
temper
and
snarled
it
all
well
enough
to
take
things
lightly
you
who
got
no
beating
but
hanging
is
no
laughing
matter
he
then
looked
cautiously
around
and
ran
back
the
way
they
had
come
when
he
returned
he
held
between
thumb
and
forefinger
the
silver
coin
phil
had
thrown
back
at
the
burly
knight
martin
bought
food
with
it
and
phil
though
he
thought
it
would
have
choked
him
helped
him
eat
it
and
so
they
survived
the
day
that
keeper
barwick
martin
said
that
evening
as
the
two
tramped
west
along
the
highway
is
my
brother
and
an
ungrateful
wretch
he
is
i
knew
he
was
your
brother
phil
said
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
martin
or
his
brother
he
was
thinking
of
the
old
knight
in
the
scarlet
cloak
so
bravely
decked
with
silver
lace
there
was
only
one
man
philip
marsham
had
ever
known
who
had
such
a
rough
just
humour
as
sir
john
bristol
or
any
such
indomitable
sense
of
fair
play
and
that
man
was
phil
dead
father
chapter
vi
the
rose
of
devon
they
came
to
bristol
over
the
hills
that
lie
to
the
south
of
the
town
they
had
lost
time
on
the
way
and
had
grown
weary
and
sore
of
foot
and
finding
at
last
that
there
was
little
hope
of
overtaking
at
bideford
the
thin
man
with
whom
they
had
parted
on
the
road
they
had
turned
north
in
somerset
at
the
end
of
polton
hill
they
passed
first
across
a
lonely
waste
where
for
miles
the
only
human
being
they
saw
was
an
aged
man
gathering
faggots
then
over
the
mendip
hills
and
through
rough
valleys
and
rougher
uplands
and
so
at
last
to
the
height
whence
bristol
and
avon
valley
and
bristol
channel
in
the
east
lie
spread
in
a
vast
panorama
far
away
in
hungroad
and
kingroad
ships
were
anchored
but
the
vessels
at
the
wharves
of
bristol
lay
with
their
keels
in
mud
for
the
tide
was
out
and
the
tides
of
bristol
as
all
know
have
a
wonderful
great
flow
and
ebb
the
two
went
on
into
the
town
where
there
were
seafaring
men
standing
about
and
talking
of
ships
which
gave
phil
marsham
a
feeling
of
being
once
more
at
home
after
his
inland
travels
and
passing
this
one
tavern
and
another
they
came
to
a
square
where
there
was
a
and
a
stocks
and
a
man
in
the
stocks
now
a
man
in
stocks
was
a
pleasing
sight
to
phil
for
he
was
not
so
old
that
he
missed
the
humour
of
it
and
he
paused
to
grin
at
the
unlucky
wight
who
bore
with
ill
grace
the
jeers
of
the
urchins
that
had
assembled
to
do
him
honour
but
when
martin
saw
the
fellow
he
looked
a
second
time
and
turned
very
hastily
round
straightway
seizing
phil
by
the
arm
he
whispered
hoarsely
come
now
we
must
hie
us
away
again
and
that
speedily
why
in
so
great
haste
phil
returned
here
is
a
pleasant
jest
let
us
stay
a
while
who
knows
but
some
day
we
may
ourselves
sit
in
the
bilboes
and
yonder
may
take
his
fill
of
pleasure
at
our
misfortune
why
then
turn
about
is
fair
play
let
us
enjoy
his
while
there
time
and
he
waited
with
quiet
glee
for
martin
angry
reply
fool
martin
whispered
stay
and
be
hanged
an
thou
wilt
thereupon
martin
posted
in
all
haste
back
the
way
he
had
come
and
phil
of
no
mind
to
be
left
now
since
they
had
journeyed
together
thus
far
followed
at
his
heels
with
a
curiosity
that
he
was
intent
on
satisfying
according
to
the
proverb
he
called
after
martin
with
an
itch
and
ends
with
a
scar
but
methinks
thy
scars
which
are
numerous
are
all
hist
fool
martin
snarled
be
still
for
i
slit
thy
throat
to
still
thy
tongue
i
swear
i
can
already
feel
the
hemp
at
my
weasand
it
burns
and
spreads
like
a
tetter
and
he
made
haste
up
out
of
the
town
till
despite
his
great
weight
and
short
wind
he
had
phil
puffing
at
his
heels
this
is
queer
talk
of
ropes
and
hangings
it
buzzeth
through
thy
noddle
like
bees
in
clover
in
faith
though
thy
folly
be
great
yet
it
sorely
presses
upon
thee
for
i
have
seldom
seen
a
man
walk
faster
yet
at
thine
ordinary
gait
a
jade
can
set
a
pace
too
fast
for
thee
to
follow
yea
laugh
at
me
wouldst
thou
stay
for
sugared
pills
of
pleasure
with
the
hangman
at
thy
heels
what
has
a
poor
devil
in
stocks
to
do
with
the
hangman
prithee
and
why
this
fierce
haste
th
art
no
better
than
a
gooseling
fit
for
tavern
quarrels
and
did
you
never
see
a
man
dance
on
air
is
a
sight
to
catch
the
breath
in
the
throat
and
make
an
emptiness
in
a
man
belly
there
be
no
hangings
without
reason
reason
law
logic
and
the
switzers
can
be
hired
to
fight
for
any
man
they
say
is
true
in
any
event
of
the
law
i
seen
the
learned
men
in
wigs
wringing
a
poor
man
withers
and
shaping
the
halter
to
his
neck
they
had
talked
breathlessly
at
long
intervals
in
their
hasty
flight
and
thus
talking
they
had
come
out
of
the
town
and
up
from
the
valley
nor
would
martin
stay
to
rest
till
from
the
southern
hill
that
had
given
them
their
first
prospect
of
bristol
city
they
looked
back
upon
the
houses
and
the
river
and
the
ships
martin
breathed
more
easily
then
and
mopped
his
forehead
and
sat
down
until
his
wildly
beating
heart
was
quieter
to
bideford
we
must
go
after
all
said
he
and
better
by
far
had
we
never
turned
from
the
straight
road
i
am
of
no
mind
to
go
farther
phil
replied
looking
back
there
will
be
more
vessels
sailing
out
of
bristol
than
out
of
bideford
a
man
can
choose
in
which
to
go
martin
gulped
and
rubbed
his
throat
nay
i
not
hear
to
it
daniel
went
but
once
into
the
lion
den
he
sighed
mightily
as
he
thought
of
begging
his
long
way
through
somerset
and
devon
for
he
was
a
big
heavy
man
and
lazy
and
short
of
wind
but
he
would
not
go
back
though
he
refused
to
speak
further
of
his
reason
for
it
and
phil
though
in
truth
he
liked
martin
little
was
too
to
part
thus
with
his
companion
of
the
road
the
lad
was
young
and
the
world
was
wide
and
it
was
still
spring
in
england
so
they
turned
toward
the
hills
which
were
blue
and
purple
in
the
setting
sun
a
shepherd
did
he
but
know
it
lives
in
halls
more
splendid
than
a
king
and
set
forth
upon
their
journey
through
the
rough
lands
of
somerset
they
went
astray
among
the
mines
but
found
their
way
to
wells
where
as
they
came
out
from
the
town
they
passed
a
gallows
which
gave
martin
such
a
start
that
he
stopped
for
neither
breath
nor
speech
until
he
had
left
that
significant
emblem
of
the
law
a
mile
behind
him
they
went
through
glastonbury
where
report
has
it
that
joseph
of
arimathea
and
king
arthur
and
king
edgar
lie
buried
and
through
bridgewater
where
to
their
wonder
there
was
a
ship
of
a
hundred
tons
riding
in
the
parret
they
went
through
dulverton
on
a
market
day
and
crossed
the
dunsbrook
by
the
stone
bridge
and
so
passed
into
devon
they
went
on
over
heath
and
hill
and
through
woods
and
green
valleys
until
at
the
end
of
seven
days
from
bristol
for
time
and
again
they
had
lost
their
way
and
a
sailor
on
shore
is
at
best
like
a
lame
horse
on
a
rough
road
they
crossed
the
taw
at
barnstable
again
going
astray
they
went
nearly
to
torrington
before
they
learned
their
blunder
and
turned
down
the
valley
of
the
torridge
but
all
things
come
to
an
end
at
last
and
one
pleasant
evening
they
crossed
the
ancient
bridge
built
on
stately
gothic
arches
into
the
populous
town
of
bideford
at
the
river
front
there
lay
a
street
the
better
part
of
a
mile
long
in
which
were
the
custom
house
and
a
great
quay
and
there
they
saw
ships
of
good
burden
loading
and
unloading
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
town
as
the
scribe
hath
it
thither
phil
would
have
gone
straightly
but
martin
shook
his
head
so
turning
up
from
the
river
they
passed
another
long
street
where
the
houses
of
wealthy
merchants
stood
and
this
too
martin
hastened
quickly
by
he
shot
glances
to
one
side
and
the
other
as
if
fearing
lest
he
see
faces
that
he
knew
and
led
his
companion
by
an
obscure
way
as
night
was
falling
to
a
cottage
whence
a
dim
light
shone
through
a
casement
window
standing
on
the
rough
doorstone
under
the
outcropping
thatch
which
projected
beyond
the
line
of
the
eaves
to
shield
the
door
from
rain
he
softly
knocked
there
was
no
answer
no
sound
but
the
door
presently
moved
ajar
as
if
by
its
own
will
who
knocks
an
old
woman
whispered
is
that
dark
i
can
not
see
thy
face
is
thine
eyes
are
ailing
come
open
the
door
and
bid
us
enter
thy
voice
hath
a
familiar
ring
but
i
know
thee
not
who
art
thou
we
be
two
honest
men
ah
two
honest
men
and
what
prithee
are
two
honest
men
doing
here
yea
is
a
fair
thrust
and
bites
both
ways
thou
old
shrew
dost
bar
the
door
to
martin
barwick
so
is
thou
i
believe
it
even
is
enter
then
ere
the
watch
spy
thee
th
art
a
plain
fool
to
stand
here
quibbling
thus
though
is
to
be
expected
since
thou
wert
ever
quicker
of
thy
tongue
than
thy
wit
but
who
thy
fellow
nay
thou
old
shrew
open
to
us
he
is
to
be
one
of
us
though
a
london
man
by
birth
one
of
us
thou
enter
and
welcome
then
young
sir
mother
taylor
bids
thee
welcome
one
of
us
is
the
more
pity
so
few
of
the
gentlemen
are
left
in
port
the
old
one
he
hath
sailed
long
since
she
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
the
three
stood
together
in
the
dark
passage
hast
money
not
a
groat
she
sighed
heavily
i
shall
be
ruined
seven
o
the
gentlemen
sailed
owing
me
yea
thou
old
shrew
had
i
a
half
nay
had
i
the
tenth
part
of
the
gold
thou
hast
taken
from
us
and
laid
away
wherever
thy
are
i
go
no
more
to
sea
but
thou
what
thou
and
there
not
one
among
us
but
will
pay
his
score
the
wonder
is
that
of
them
thou
hang
by
a
word
none
has
slit
thy
scrawny
throat
aye
they
pay
they
pay
and
the
gentlemen
bear
mother
taylor
nought
but
love
how
else
could
they
do
their
business
but
for
good
mother
taylor
she
led
them
into
a
little
back
room
where
there
was
a
fire
and
a
singing
kettle
and
as
she
scuttled
with
a
crooked
nimble
gait
from
one
window
to
another
to
make
sure
that
every
shutter
was
fast
closed
in
her
cracked
old
voice
she
bade
them
sit
to
his
prudent
companion
whose
quick
glance
was
marking
every
door
and
window
for
who
knows
when
a
man
shall
have
need
to
leave
in
haste
a
sailor
inn
quoth
martin
the
old
witch
is
a
rare
hand
to
sell
a
cargo
got
thou
guess
well
enough
how
and
the
man
who
would
bring
a
of
spirits
past
the
customs
on
a
dark
night
or
would
bargain
with
a
dartmoor
shepherd
for
wool
secretly
sheared
can
lay
the
matter
before
her
and
go
his
way
knowing
she
will
do
his
business
better
than
he
could
do
it
himself
yea
a
man
honour
and
life
are
safer
with
her
than
with
any
lord
in
england
she
showed
by
a
grunt
that
she
had
heard
him
but
otherwise
paid
no
attention
to
what
he
said
she
brought
food
from
a
cupboard
and
laid
the
table
by
the
fire
and
going
into
a
back
room
she
drew
a
foaming
pitcher
of
beer
no
wine
cried
martin
mother
taylor
has
no
wine
come
thou
old
beldame
serve
us
a
stronger
tipple
she
laughed
shrilly
the
beer
said
she
is
from
why
then
i
must
needs
drink
and
say
nought
since
it
is
common
report
that
the
gentry
choose
it
when
well
aged
rather
than
the
wine
of
portugal
or
france
but
my
heart
was
set
on
good
wine
or
stronger
spirits
he
who
sails
on
the
morning
tide
must
go
sober
to
bed
else
he
may
rue
his
choice
aye
an
is
rare
fine
beer
her
old
bent
back
fitted
into
her
bent
old
chair
her
face
settled
into
a
myriad
wrinkles
from
which
her
crooked
nose
projected
like
a
fish
in
a
bulging
net
she
was
very
old
and
very
shrewd
and
though
there
was
something
unspeakably
hard
in
her
small
cold
eyes
martin
trusted
her
as
thus
far
he
had
trusted
no
one
they
had
met
even
to
phil
she
gave
an
odd
sense
of
confidence
in
her
complete
loyalty
at
phil
she
cast
many
glances
quick
and
sharp
like
a
bird
but
she
never
spoke
to
him
nor
he
to
her
it
was
martin
who
again
spoke
up
having
blunted
the
edge
of
his
hunger
and
now
you
old
witch
who
in
port
and
where
shall
we
find
the
softest
berths
for
you
made
it
plain
that
since
trust
us
you
must
you
will
trust
us
little
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
in
thy
head
that
our
score
shall
mount
high
she
chuckled
down
in
her
skinny
old
crop
let
us
see
the
old
one
has
gone
and
that
done
you
were
late
is
a
long
road
and
we
went
astray
there
the
nestor
and
the
essay
they
will
be
off
soon
the
one
to
liverpool
for
salt
t
other
to
ireland
for
wool
martin
thereupon
set
down
his
pot
of
beer
and
significantly
rubbed
his
throat
at
which
the
old
woman
cackled
with
shrill
laughter
aye
art
well
known
in
liverpool
well
let
us
consider
again
the
rose
of
devon
new
come
from
plymouth
i
hear
she
never
touched
at
bideford
before
and
her
master
hails
from
dorset
his
name
is
candle
martin
laughed
boisterously
a
bright
and
shining
name
but
i
know
him
not
and
will
chance
a
singeing
what
voyage
does
she
make
she
goeth
to
fetch
cod
from
newfoundland
the
old
woman
saw
him
hesitate
a
barren
voyage
thou
nay
well
for
one
of
the
gentlemen
to
look
into
that
trade
who
knows
true
old
mother
witch
who
knows
martin
tapped
the
table
arrange
it
nay
but
i
can
start
the
wedge
we
go
said
martin
at
last
but
now
for
bed
we
been
a
weary
while
on
the
road
it
was
a
great
bed
in
a
small
room
under
the
thatch
and
as
they
lay
there
on
the
good
in
the
dark
martin
said
we
sail
in
this
rose
of
devon
lad
phil
already
nearly
asleep
stirred
and
roused
up
any
port
in
a
storm
he
mumbled
then
becoming
wider
awake
he
asked
what
is
all
this
talk
of
gentlemen
and
who
prithee
is
the
old
one
ah
a
natural
question
though
the
room
was
dark
as
egypt
phil
knew
by
martin
voice
for
he
could
recognize
every
inflection
and
change
in
tone
that
the
sly
crafty
look
was
creeping
over
his
fat
red
face
well
martin
continued
after
a
moment
of
silence
by
she
means
a
few
seafaring
men
that
keep
company
together
by
custom
and
stop
here
when
ashore
all
fine
honest
fellows
as
a
man
may
be
proud
to
know
i
have
hopes
that
some
day
you
be
one
of
us
phil
my
lad
and
some
day
i
tell
you
more
as
for
the
old
one
it
very
curiously
happens
that
you
have
met
with
him
do
you
recall
to
mind
the
thin
man
i
quarrelled
with
that
first
day
yea
that
is
the
old
one
and
tom
jordan
is
his
proper
name
it
was
martin
after
all
who
fell
asleep
first
for
phil
lay
in
the
great
bed
in
the
small
room
thinking
of
all
that
had
happened
since
the
day
he
fled
from
moll
stevens
alehouse
there
was
colin
samson
whose
dirk
he
wore

was
the
man
with
the
great
book

were
martin
and
tom
jordan
the
old

there
were
the

and
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
it
all
seemed
so
utterly
unreal
and
nell
entick
and
sir
john
bristol
he
fell
asleep
thinking
of
nell
and
sir
john
and
dreamed
of
marrying
nell
and
keeping
a
tavern
to
which
the
bluff
old
knight
came
in
the
guise
of
a
very
aged
gentleman
from
little
grimsby
with
a
coachman
who
went
poaching
pheasants
in
the
tavern
yard
it
was
early
morning
when
mother
taylor
called
them
down
to
breakfast
at
a
table
burdened
with
good
food
such
as
they
had
not
eaten
for
many
long
days
she
sat
by
the
fire
a
bent
old
woman
in
a
little
chair
watching
them
with
keen
small
eyes
while
they
ate
and
smiling
in
a
way
that
set
her
wrinkles
all
to
see
them
empty
dish
after
dish
th
art
a
good
old
witch
mother
taylor
though
the
devil
cry
nay
said
martin
though
thy
score
be
high
never
thou
grudge
a
man
the
meat
he
ate
is
not
for
nought
the
gentlemen
love
mother
taylor
she
quavered
what
can
a
woman
do
when
her
beauty
gone
but
hold
a
man
by
the
food
she
sets
before
him
is
the
secret
of
blessed
marriage

and
heaven

thee
a
wife
as
knows
it
like
i
beauty
thou
old
beldame
what
thou
ever
know
of
beauty
but
beauty
is
a
matter
of
little
moment
hast
thou
prepared
the
way
for
us
she
laughed
in
shrill
delight
at
his
rough
jesting
aye
i
ha
sent
a
messenger
seek
out
the
rose
of
devon
and
do
thy
part
and
all
shall
be
well
and
whence
does
good
captain
candle
expect
his
men
say
to
captain
candle
that
thou
and
this
handsome
young
gentleman
who
says
so
little
are
come
from
the
mersey
where
thy
vessel
the
pride
lancashire
lies
to
be
repaired
and
that
master
stephen
gangley
sent
thee
she
looked
at
phil
who
had
learned
long
before
to
hold
his
tongue
in
strange
places
and
he
smiled
but
martin
laughed
hoarsely
th
art
the
devil
own
daughter
and
does
this
master
stephen
gangley
in
all
truth
dwell
in
liverpool
dost
think
my
wits
are
wandering
martin
nay
i
be
old
but
not
so
old
as
that
go
hastily
through
the
town
lest
thou
be
seen
and
known
thou
of
all
the
gentlemen
most
needs
make
haste
the
two
stopped
just
inside
the
door
you
have
chalked
down
the
score
against
us
she
laughed
in
her
skinny
throat
i
be
old
but
not
so
old
as
to
forget
the
score
the
gentlemen
always
pay
she
pushed
martin
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
then
seizing
phil
by
the
arm
she
whispered
leave
him
martin
angrily
thrust
the
door
open
again
and
she
gave
phil
a
shove
that
sent
him
stumbling
over
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
shut
and
they
heard
the
bolt
slide
they
pay
martin
muttered
yea
they
pay
in
full
and
the
old
witch
hath
got
rich
thereby
for
is
pay
or
hang
so
much
does
she
know
of
all
that
goes
on
at
sea
in
faith
i
sorely
mistrust
she
is
a
witch
in
all
earnest
but
even
be
it
so
a
most
useful
witch
as
the
two
came
into
the
town
they
saw
at
a
distance
a
crowd
gathering
dogs
barked
and
boys
shouted
and
men
came
running
and
laughing
which
seemed
to
give
promise
of
rare
sport
of
one
kind
or
another
see
cried
phil
catching
martin
by
the
arm
here
a
game
come
let
us
join
the
cry
thou
art
a
very
pattern
of
blockishness
quoth
martin
see
us
in
pillory
egged
turnipped
nay
beaten
at
the
post
come
old
frog
i
for
one
will
run
the
hazard
old
frog
is
it
martin
face
flamed
redder
than
before
an
we
loiter
there
be
sharp
eyes
upon
us
my
very
throat
is
itching
at
the
thought
justice
is
swift
who
knows
but
we
swing
by
sundown
hast
never
considered
the
pains
of
hanging
the
way
they
dance
and
twitch
is
enough
to
take
the
sap
out
of
a
man
legs
martin
fears
were
an
old
story
and
the
lad
heeded
them
so
little
save
when
he
would
make
game
of
them
that
he
never
even
smiled
see
he
cried
there
a
man
in
their
midst
stay
who
is
he
he
is
yea
he
is
the
very
one
come
back
to
bideford
despite
his
fears
and
it
seems
the
townsfolk
know
him
well
the
jeering
mob
parted
and
revealed
a
lank
man
with
a
great
book
his
voice
rose
above
their
clamour
o
well
beloved
o
well
beloved
never
was
a
man
perplexed
with
such
diversity
of
thoughts
but
martin
was
gone
and
phil
hastening
after
him
saw
a
face
in
a
window
which
was
watching
martin
hurry
through
the
town
and
when
phil
pursued
martin
the
eyes
in
the
window
scanned
the
lad
from
head
to
foot
they
found
lying
at
the
quay
the
vessel
they
sought
and
a
brave
frigate
she
was
with
high
poop
and
nobly
carved
fiddlehead
and
sharp
deep
cutwater
the
ports
were
closed
but
on
the
main
deck
was
a
great
show
of
ordnance
with
new
carriages
and
new
yellow
breechings
there
were
on
the
forecastle
and
the
and
there
was
a
finely
wrought
lantern
of
bronze
and
glass
at
the
stern
but
as
they
came
up
to
her
a
cloud
hid
the
sun
and
the
gilded
carving
ceased
to
shine
and
the
bright
colours
lost
their
brilliance
and
her
black
high
sides
loomed
up
sombrely
and
to
phil
she
seemed
for
the
moment
very
dark
and
forbidding
of
this
martin
appeared
to
have
no
perception
for
he
smiled
and
whispered
mother
taylor
hath
done
well
by
us
this
rose
of
devon
is
a
tall
ship
and
by
all
the
signs
she
will
be
well
found
there
were
men
standing
about
the
capstan
on
the
main
deck
and
voices
came
from
the
forecastle
but
on
the
poop
there
leaned
against
the
rail
to
watch
the
two
come
down
the
quay
a
single
man
of
an
age
in
the
with
a
keen
strong
face
who
wore
a
good
coat
on
his
back
and
had
the
manner
of
a
king
in
a
small
island
they
stepped
under
the
poop
and
martin
doffed
his
hat
having
assumed
his
most
ingratiating
smile
an
it
please
you
sir
said
he
have
i
the
honour
to
address
captain
candle
of
the
rose
of
devon
frigate
i
am
captain
candle
good
morrow
to
thee
sir
and
master
stephen
gangley
of
liverpool
sent
us
yea
i
received
his
letter
i
know
him
not
but
it
seems
he
knows
friends
of
mine
you
are
over
heavy
for
a
good
seaman
but
your
fellow
takes
my
eye
martin
stammered
and
flamed
up
with
anger
and
perceiving
this
the
captain
smiled
let
it
be
he
said
i
can
make
room
for
the
two
and
to
judge
by
your
looks
if
you
are
slow
aloft
at
handling
and
hauling
we
can
use
you
to
excellent
purpose
as
a
cook
of
good
food
and
plenty
it
is
plain
you
know
the
secret
he
watched
policy
contend
with
anger
in
martin
face
and
his
own
expression
gave
no
hint
of
what
went
on
in
his
mind
but
there
was
that
about
him
which
made
phil
believe
he
was
inwardly
laughing
and
phil
had
an
instant
liking
for
the
man
which
if
one
might
judge
by
the
captain
glance
or
two
was
returned
you
may
sign
the
articles
in
the
tavern
yonder
he
said
you
are
none
too
early
for
we
sail
in
an
hour
time
to
get
the
tide
as
phil
followed
martin
into
the
tavern
he
saw
a
bustle
and
flurry
in
the
street
but
it
passed
and
while
they
waited
by
the
fire
for
the
captain
and
the
agent
to
come
with
the
articles
he
thought
no
more
of
it
they
came
at
last
and
other
seamen
with
them
and
spread
the
articles
on
the
oaken
table
where
one
man
might
sign
after
another
and
when
martin
turn
was
come
he
tried
to
speak
of
wages
but
the
captain
named
the
figure
and
bade
him
sign
and
before
he
thought
he
had
done
so
he
stood
back
cursing
under
his
breath
and
when
the
captain
named
a
higher
wage
for
phil
martin
cursing
became
an
audible
mumble
which
drew
from
master
and
agent
a
sharp
glance
though
martin
smiled
and
looked
about
as
if
to
see
whence
the
sound
came
he
deceived
no
one
the
men
filed
out
of
the
tavern
walking
soberly
behind
the
master
and
proceeded
down
the
quay
to
their
ship
their
feet
clattered
on
the
cobbles
and
they
swung
along
at
a
rolling
gait
some
were
sober
and
some
were
drunk
and
some
were
merry
and
some
were
sad
some
eyed
one
another
with
the
curiosity
that
a
man
feels
if
he
must
sit
for
months
to
come
at
cheek
and
jowl
with
strangers
and
some
bent
their
eyes
on
the
ground
as
if
ill
at
ease
and
uncertain
of
their
own
discretion
in
thus
committing
themselves
to
no
one
knew
what
adventures
in
distant
seas
and
lands
thus
they
came
to
the
ship
following
at
the
master
heels
and
thus
they
filed
on
board
while
captain
candle
stood
at
one
side
and
looked
them
over
as
they
passed
to
a
young
fellow
leaning
over
the
waist
one
of
the
men
called
well
met
will
canty
looking
up
phil
himself
then
caught
the
eye
of
a
lad
of
his
own
years
who
was
returning
the
hail
of
a
former
shipmate
and
since
each
of
the
youths
found
something
to
his
taste
in
the
appearance
of
the
other
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
they
joined
company
you
come
late
said
the
one
who
had
answered
to
the
name
of
will
canty
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
you
were
not
on
board
yesterday
he
was
tall
and
slender
and
very
straight
and
he
carried
his
head
with
an
erectness
that
seemed
at
first
glance
to
savour
of
vanity
his
face
too
was
of
a
sober
cast
and
his
expression
restrained
yet
he
seemed
a
likable
fellow
withal
and
one
whom
a
man
could
trust
i
have
not
until
now
set
foot
on
this
deck
phil
replied
but
having
seen
many
vessels
in
my
time
i
venture
that
the
rose
of
devon
is
a
staunch
ship
as
captain
candle
it
is
plain
to
see
is
a
proper
master
yea
both
sayings
are
true
i
know
for
i
have
sailed
before
in
this
ship
with
captain
candle
an
order
bawled
from
the
caused
a
great
stir
and
for
the
moment
put
an
end
to
their
talk
but
they
were
to
see
more
of
each
other
casting
off
the
moorings
in
answer
to
the
word
of
command
the
men
sprang
to
the
capstan
it
was
heave
my
bullies
and
pull
my
hearts
of
gold
some
in
a
boat
carried
out
an
anchor
and
others
laboured
at
the
capstan
the
old
frigate
stirred
uneasily
and
slipped
away
from
the
wharf
rolling
slightly
with
the
motion
of
the
sea
and
thus
they
kedged
her
into
the
tide
bend
your
passeree
to
the
mainsail
back
came
a
roaring
chorus
yea
yea
get
your
sails
to
the
yards
there
about
your
gear
on
all
hands
yea
yea
men
here
and
there
replied
hoist
sails
high
make
ready
to
set
sail
yea
yea
cross
your
yards
yea
yea
bring
the
cable
to
the
capstan
boatswain
fetch
the
anchor
aboard
break
ground
up
there
a
hand
to
the
foretop
and
loose
the
foretopsail
yea
yea
and
the
first
man
to
set
foot
on
the
ratlines
was
running
up
the
rigging
it
was
philip
marsham
for
to
him
the
sea
was
home
and
there
was
no
night
so
dark
he
could
not
find
his
way
about
a
ship
nor
did
his
promptness
escape
the
sharp
eye
of
captain
candle
now
while
the
captain
stood
with
folded
arms
at
the
poop
his
mate
cried
come
my
hearts
heave
up
your
anchor
come
one
and
all
who
says
o
brave
hearts
the
anchor
yea
yea
heave
out
your
topsails
haul
your
sheets
let
fall
your
foresail
you
at
the
helm
there
steer
steady
before
the
wind
on
all
the
vessels
in
the
harbour
and
all
along
the
quay
and
the
streets
men
had
stopped
their
work
to
see
the
rose
of
devon
sail
but
though
most
of
them
stood
idle
and
silent
there
was
a
sudden
flurry
on
the
quay
where
but
now
she
had
been
lying
and
two
men
burst
out
calling
after
her
and
waving
their
arms
is
the
beadle
and
the
constable
the
men
muttered
who
of
us
hath
got
to
sea
to
escape
the
law
the
mate
turned
to
the
master
but
the
master
firmly
shook
his
head
come
seize
the
tide
he
called
we
will
stay
for
no
man
heave
out
the
foretopsail
heave
out
the
main
topsail
haul
home
your
topsail
sheets
the
men
aloft
let
the
lesser
sails
fall
the
men
on
deck
sheeted
them
home
and
hoisted
them
up
the
mate
kept
bawling
a
multitude
of
orders
haul
in
the
cable
there
and
coil
it
in
small
fakes
haul
the
cat
a
bitter
belay
luff
my
man
luff
you
there
with
the
shank
painter
make
fast
your
anchor
then
came
the
voice
of
the
master
which
always
his
mate
echoed
let
fall
your
mainsail
and
the
echo
let
fall
your
mainsail
yea
yea
on
with
your
bonnets
and
drabblers
and
again
came
the
echo
from
the
mate
on
with
your
bonnets
and
drabblers
yea
yea
the
great
guns
ranged
along
the
deck
each
bound
fast
by
its
new
breechings
with
their
linstocks
and
sponges
and
ladles
and
rammers
made
no
idle
show
of
warlike
strength
there
was
too
often
need
to
let
their
grim
voices
sound
at
bay
for
those
were
wild
lawless
days
such
a
ship
as
the
rose
of
devon
frigate
standing
out
for
the
open
sea
is
a
sight
the
world
no
longer
affords
those
ships
are
gone
gone
gone
with
lost
atlantis
their
lofty
poops
their
little
bonaventure
masts
their
lateen
sails
aft
their
high
forecastles
and
tall
bowsprits
with
the
square
spritsail
flaunted
before
the
fiddlehead
came
down
from
an
even
earlier
day
for
the
rose
of
devon
had
been
an
ancient
craft
when
king
james
died
and
king
charles
succeeded
to
the
throne
but
she
was
a
fine
tall
ship
and
staunch
notwithstanding
her
years
and
there
was
newly
gilded
carving
on
bow
and
stern
and
a
new
band
of
crimson
ran
her
length
with
her
great
sails
spread
she
thrust
her
nose
into
the
heavy
swell
that
went
rolling
up
the
bristol
channel
and
nodding
and
curtseying
to
old
neptune
she
entered
upon
his
dominions
she
was
as
i
have
said
a
brave
tall
ship
yet
despite
her
gilded
carving
and
her
band
of
crimson
her
towering
sides
which
were
painted
black
gave
her
a
singularly
dark
appearance
and
she
put
to
sea
like
a
shadow
out
of
older
days
chapter
vii
the
ship
liar
death
by
land
is
a
sobering
thing
and
works
many
changes
but
to
my
thought
death
at
sea
is
more
terrible
for
there
is
a
vast
loneliness
with
only
a
single
ship
in
the
midst
of
it
and
an
empty
hammock
for
days
and
weeks
and
even
months
to
keep
a
man
in
mind
of
what
has
happened
and
death
at
sea
may
work
as
many
changes
as
death
by
land
now
the
rose
of
devon
was
a
week
from
england
when
a
footrope
parted
and
the
boatswain
pitched
down
clutching
at
the
great
belly
of
the
sail
and
plunged
out
of
sight
and
what
could
a
man
do
to
save
him
they
never
saw
him
after
that
first
wild
plunge
there
aloft
was
the
parted
rope
its
ends
frayed
out
and
hanging
below
decks
was
the
empty
berth
the
blustering
old
boatswain
with
his
great
roaring
voice
and
his
quick
ear
for
a
tune
had
gone
upon
the
ultimate
adventure
which
all
must
face
each
man
for
himself
but
they
only
said
did
you
see
the
wild
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
fell
and
i
fear
we
shall
hear
his
pipe
of
nights
and
is
a
queer
thought
that
neddie
hart
is
to
lie
in
old
davy
jones
palace
with
the
queer
all
about
him
awaiting
for
his
old
shipmates
presently
the
master
boy
came
forward
into
the
forecastle
where
the
men
off
duty
were
sitting
and
talking
of
the
one
who
had
fallen
so
far
had
sunk
so
deep
had
gone
on
a
journey
so
long
that
they
should
never
see
him
again
and
quietly
for
the
boy
was
much
bedevilled
and
trembled
with
fright
to
think
of
putting
his
head
as
it
were
into
the
mouth
of
the
lion
he
crept
behind
philip
marsham
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
master
would
see
thee
in
the
great
cabin
they
sat
at
close
quarters
in
the
forecastle
of
the
rose
of
devon
and
the
boy
had
barely
room
to
pass
the
table
and
the
benches
for
the
men
had
crowded
in
and
put
their
heads
together
but
for
once
they
were
too
intent
on
their
own
thoughts
to
heed
his
coming
or
his
going
which
gave
him
vast
comfort
little
enough
comfort
the
poor
devil
got
between
the
men
forward
and
the
officers
aft
so
phil
rose
and
followed
the
great
cabin
when
he
entered
was
empty
he
stood
at
loss
waiting
but
curiously
observed
meanwhile
the
rich
hangings
and
the
deep
chairs
and
the
cupboards
filled
with
porcelain
ware
there
was
plate
on
the
cabin
table
and
a
rich
cloak
lay
thrown
loosely
over
a
chair
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
those
captains
lived
like
princes
as
indeed
they
did
he
shifted
his
weight
from
foot
to
foot
in
growing
uneasiness
the
boy
had
disappeared
there
was
no
sound
of
voice
or
step
then
as
the
ship
rolled
and
phil
put
out
a
foot
to
brace
himself
a
door
swung
open
and
revealed
on
the
walk
that
ran
across
the
stem
under
the
poop
the
lean
figure
of
captain
francis
candle
the
master
of
the
rose
of
devon
stood
with
folded
arms
and
bent
head
but
though
his
head
was
bent
his
eyes
the
lad
could
see
were
peering
from
under
his
heavy
brows
at
the
horizon
he
swayed
as
the
ship
rolled
and
remained
intent
on
his
thoughts
which
so
absorbed
him
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
sending
the
boy
for
philip
marsham
so
phil
waited
and
the
broad
hat
that
hung
on
the
bulkhead
scraped
backward
and
forward
as
the
ship
plunged
into
the
trough
and
rose
on
the
swell
and
captain
candle
remained
intent
on
his
thoughts
and
a
sea
bird
circled
over
the
wake
of
the
ship
after
a
long
time
the
master
turned
about
and
walked
into
the
cabin
and
there
espying
philip
marsham
he
smiled
and
said
i
was
remiss
i
had
forgotten
you
he
threw
aside
the
cloak
that
lay
on
the
chair
and
sat
down
sit
you
down
he
said
with
a
nod
you
are
a
practised
seaman
no
lame
decrepit
fellow
who
serves
for
underwages
have
you
mastered
the
theory
why
sir
i
am
not
unacquainted
with
astrolabe
and
quadrant
and
on
scales
and
tables
i
have
spent
much
labour
so
and
his
manner
showed
surprise
then
inkpot
and
quill
are
before
you
choose
a
fair
sheet
and
put
down
thereon
the
problem
i
shall
set
you
the
captain
leaned
back
and
half
closed
his
eyes
while
phil
spread
the
paper
and
dipped
the
quill
let
us
say
he
finally
continued
that
two
ships
sail
from
one
port
the
first
sails
a
certain
distance
then
altering
her
course
she
sails
due
west
leagues
the
second
ship
having
sailed
leagues
meets
with
the
first
ship
i
demand
the
second
ship
course
and
rhomb
and
how
many
leagues
the
first
ship
sailed
now
my
man
how
go
you
to
work
phil
studied
the
problem
as
he
had
set
it
down
and
wrinkled
his
brows
over
it
while
captain
candle
lay
back
with
a
flicker
of
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
watched
the
lad
struggle
with
his
thoughts
after
a
time
phil
raised
his
head
first
sir
said
he
i
shall
draw
the
first
ship
rhomb
thus
from
a
unto
e
which
shall
be
then
i
shall
lay
a
line
from
a
unto
c
as
the
ninety
leagues
that
she
sailed
west
next
i
shall
lay
my
line
from
c
to
d
and
further
as
her
course
then
i
shall
lay
from
a
a
line
that
shall
correspond
to
the
leagues
the
second
ship
sailed
which
cuts
at
d
the
line
i
drew
before
as
he
talked
he
worked
with
his
pen
and
the
master
rising
as
if
in
surprise
bent
over
the
table
and
watched
every
motion
the
pen
drew
lines
and
arcs
and
lettered
them
and
wrote
out
a
problem
in
proportions
hesitating
the
point
crawled
over
columns
of
figures
the
rhomb
of
the
second
ship
said
phil
at
last
is
degrees
and
minutes
her
course
is
near
and
the
first
ship
sailed
leagues
tapping
the
table
as
one
does
who
meditates
captain
candle
looked
more
sharply
at
the
lad
you
are
clever
with
your
pen
is
owing
to
the
good
arber
at
roehampton
phil
replied
had
i
abode
with
him
longer
i
had
been
cleverer
still
for
he
was
an
able
scholar
but
there
was
much
in
school
i
had
no
taste
for
the
captain
eyes
searched
his
face
i
sent
for
you
he
said
because
i
was
minded
to
make
you
my
boatswain
but
now
if
my
mate
were
lost
i
swear
i
seat
you
at
mine
own
table
phil
rose
go
then
master
boatswain
but
stay
you
and
your
comerado
make
a
strange
pair
how
came
you
bedfellows
why
sir
we
met
upon
the
road
yea
not
at
sea
not
at
sea
enough
is
said
begone
master
boatswain
begone
how
now
cried
martin
when
phil
passed
him
on
the
deck
art
thou
called
before
the
mast
and
he
laughed
till
he
shook
nay
he
hath
made
me
his
boatswain
thou
yea
comerado
thou
a
mere
gooseling
the
master
on
the
road
to
bedlam
why
here
am
i
martin
red
face
flamed
hot
yea
he
spoke
of
thee
ah
quoth
he
thou
art
a
fine
fellow
but
martin
and
overbold
ah
the
crafty
sly
look
came
upon
martin
face
and
he
puffed
with
pride
but
phil
delighting
to
see
the
jest
take
effect
laughed
before
his
eyes
which
sorely
perplexed
him
a
fine
fellow
but
overbold
martin
muttered
as
he
coiled
the
cable
in
neat
fakes
yea
i
did
not
believe
he
thought
so
well
of
me
from
the
glances
he
hath
bestowed
upon
me
it
was
in
my
mind
he
was
a
narrow
man
martin
smiled
and
dallied
over
his
work
one
with
no
eye
for
a
mariner
of
parts
and
skill
fine
fellow
but
overbold
nay
that
is
fair
speech
and
it
seems
he
hath
a
very
searching
observation
standing
erect
martin
folded
his
arms
and
swelled
like
a
his
eyes
being
on
the
horizon
and
his
back
toward
the
watchful
mate
he
remained
unaware
that
he
had
attracted
the
mate
attention
a
fine
fellow
but
overbold
he
repeated
and
smiled
with
a
very
haughty
air
the
mate
casting
his
eyes
about
the
deck
picked
up
a
handy
end
of
rope
and
made
a
knot
in
it
one
man
and
another
and
another
became
aware
of
the
play
that
the
mate
and
martin
were
about
to
set
and
grinning
hugely
they
paused
in
their
work
to
watch
even
though
they
risked
getting
themselves
into
such
a
plight
as
martin
the
captain
came
to
the
break
of
the
and
perceiving
the
fun
afoot
leaned
on
the
slowly
his
humour
mastered
his
dignity
and
a
smile
twitched
at
his
lips
a
fine
fellow
but
overbold
martin
was
murmuring
for
the
fourth
time
when
the
rope
whistled
and
wound
about
his
ribs
and
the
knot
fetched
up
on
his
belly
with
a
thump
that
knocked
his
wind
clean
out
he
made
a
horrible
face
gasping
for
breath
and
his
ruddy
colour
darkened
to
purple
reaching
for
his
knife
he
whirled
round
and
drew
steel
what
rakehell
muckworm
what
base
stinkard
what
he
met
the
cold
eye
of
the
mate
and
for
a
moment
flinched
then
burning
with
his
own
folly
he
cried
thou
villain
to
strike
thus
a
man
the
captain
himself
called
a
fine
fellow
but
overbold
a
snicker
grew
in
the
silence
and
swelled
into
a
rumble
of
laughter
then
by
the
forecastle
bulkhead
a
man
began
to
bawl
a
liar
a
liar
the
mate
stopped
short
and
his
hand
fell
a
score
of
voices
took
up
the
cry
a
liar
a
liar
and
martin
turned
pale
captain
candle
on
the
was
laughing
softly
and
the
mate
in
glee
slapped
his
thigh
thou
yerking
firking
jerking
tinker
said
he
dost
hear
the
cry
is
a
monday
morning
and
they
are
crying
thee
at
the
mainmast
a
liar
a
liar
the
men
bawled
crowding
close
about
but
is
no
lie
or
this
foully
deceitful
comerado
this
boatswain
it
came
suddenly
upon
martin
that
he
had
been
sorely
gulled
and
that
to
reveal
the
truth
would
fix
upon
him
the
lasting
ridicule
of
his
shipmates
he
swelled
in
fury
and
gave
them
angry
glances
but
they
only
laughed
the
louder
then
rope
in
hand
the
mate
stepped
toward
him
though
he
made
a
motion
as
if
to
stand
his
ground
at
sight
of
the
rope
martin
hand
shook
in
his
haste
to
thrust
his
knife
back
into
the
sheath
it
was
the
old
custom
of
the
sea
that
they
should
hail
as
a
liar
the
man
first
caught
in
a
lie
on
a
monday
morning
and
proclaim
him
thus
from
the
mainmast
and
unhappy
was
the
man
thus
hailed
for
thereby
he
became
for
a
week
the
ship
liar
and
held
his
place
under
the
swabber
for
seven
days
thou
old
cozzener
said
the
mate
thou
shalt
keep
clean
the
beakhead
and
the
chains
and
lucky
art
thou
to
be
at
sea
ashore
they
would
have
whipped
thee
through
the
streets
at
the
tail
again
a
great
wave
of
laughter
swept
the
deck
and
by
his
face
martin
showed
his
anger
but
though
he
was
a
fine
fellow
and
overbold
he
kept
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
and
whatever
he
suspected
of
philip
marsham
he
held
his
peace
and
went
over
the
bow
with
ill
grace
and
fell
to
scraping
the
chains
which
was
a
task
to
humble
the
tallest
pride
there
was
that
in
the
laughter
of
the
crew
which
had
taught
discretion
to
even
bolder
men
than
martin
barwick
i
have
seen
his
kind
before
a
voice
said
low
in
phil
ear
but
though
there
be
much
of
the
calf
in
him
beware
lest
you
rouse
him
to
such
a
pitch
that
he
will
draw
and
strike
it
was
will
canty
the
youth
who
had
already
won
the
young
liking
spoke
thus
he
was
a
comerado
more
to
phil
taste
than
was
the
luckless
martin
but
fate
is
not
given
to
consulting
tastes
and
necessity
forces
upon
a
traveller
such
bedfellows
as
he
meets
by
the
way

storm
the
storm
brewed
long
in
gray
banks
of
cloud
that
hung
in
the
west
and
north
it
drew
around
the
rose
of

from

to

with
a
slow
immutable
force
as
yet
perceived
rather
than
felt
till

in
the

of

the

from

sniffed
at
the
damp

and
studying
the
winds
as
they
veered
and
rose
in
brisk
flourishes
and
fell
to
the
merest
whisper
of
a
breeze
he
puckered
his
lips
which
was
his
way
when
thoughts
crowded
upon
him
martin
on
the
beakhead
pursued
his
noisome
task
of
cleaning
it
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the

who
took
unkind
joy
in
exacting
from
him
the

and
cast
furtive
glances
at
the

came

up
from

marsham
fell
to
work
overhauling
the
bolts
of
and
the
hanks
of
cordage
and
the
coils
of
rope
till
he
had
found
a
new
foresail
and
laid
it
under
the
hatch
and
had
placed
great
ropes
and
such
cordage
as
headlines
and
marlines
and
sennets
so
that
a
man
could
lay
hands
on
them
in
a
time
of
haste
and
confusion
for
the
rose
of
devon
was
heavily
pitching
and
the
seas
crashed
on
her
planks
with
a
noise
like
thunderclaps
and
when
she
lifted
on
the
swell
the
water
rumbled
against
her
bilge
and
gurgled
away
past
her
run
very
faintly
he
heard
a
sailor
voice
the
pump
is
choked
there
was
shouting
above
for
a
time
then
the
cry
arose
which
brought
reassurance
to
all
now
she
sucks
and
again
there
was
quiet
climbing
through
the
hatch
and
passing
aft
along
the
main
deck
he
heard
for
himself
the
from

pump
well
then
the
rattle
of
tiller
and
creak
of
pintle
as
the
helmsmen
eased

off

fetch
my

of
bottles
for
i
would
drink
a
health
to
all

and
i
would
have
the

served
out
each
a
little
sack
by
midday
the
veering
winds
had
settled
in
the
east
and
the
overcast
sky
had
still
further
darkened
the
ship
labouring
heavily
held
her
course
but
as
the
wind
blew
up
a
fresh
gale
the
after
sails
took
the
wind
from
the
sails
forward
which
began
to
beat
and
thresh
swarming
aloft
the
younkers
handed
the
the
fore
and
main
topsails
and
the
but
as
they
manned
the
foreyard
the
ship
yawed
in
such
a
manner
that
the
full
force
of
the
wind
struck
the
old
foresail
and
split
it
under
their
fingers
philip
marsham
on
the
weather
yardarm
with
the
grey
seas
breaking
in
foam
beneath
him
at
one
minute

with

itself
seeming
to
rise
up
at
him
the
next
minute
so
heavily
did
the
old
ship
roll
was
reaching
for
the
sail
at
the
moment
it
tore
to
ribands
and
a
billow
of
grey
canvas
striking
him
in
the
face
knocked
him
off
the
yard
but
as
he
fell
he
locked
his
legs
round
the
spar
and
got
finger
hold
on
the
earing
and
crawled
back
to
the
mast
as
the
sailors
stood
by
the
ropes
to
strike
the
yard
and
get
in
the
threshing
tatters
of
the
sail
the
mate
going
aft
was
caught
in
the
waist
when
the
ship
gave
a
mighty
lurch
and
went
tumbling
to
where
the
were
spouting
like
so
many
fountains
all
the
fall
might
well
have
ended
his
days
had
he
not
bumped
into
the
capstan
where
he
clung
fast
with
both
arms
and
twice
lucky
he
was
to
stay
his
fall
thus
for
a
sea
came
roaring
over
the
waist
and
drowned
the
fountains
in
the
scuppers
and
in
a
trice
the
decks
were
from
forecastle
to
poop
but
the
old
ship
shook
her
head
and
righted
and
captain
francis
candle
leaning
against
the
wind
his
cloak
flapping
in
the
gale
and
his
hat
hauled
hard
down
over
his
eyes
descended
from
the
poop
and
braced
himself
in
its
lee
the
wind
blows
frisking
the
mate
cried
scrambling
up
the
ladder
and
joining
the
master
yea
it
is
like
to
she
took
a
shrewd
plunge
but
now
we
shall
further
our
voyage
by
striking
every
sail
go
thou
mate
and
have
them
secure
the
then
take
thy
station
on
the
forecastle
for
an
hour
or
two
the
old
rose
of
devon
went
plunging
through
the
seas
and
there
was
much
loosing
and
lowering
of
sails
for
a
while
then
the
wind
scanted
so
that
there
was
hope
the
storm
had
passed
and
during
the
lull
they
bent
and
set
the
new
foresail
and
must
needs
brace
and
veer
and
haul
aft
but
ere
long
the
gale
blew
up
amain
and
in
the
late
afternoon
captain
candle
sniffing
the
breeze
called
upon
all
to
stand
by
and
once
more
to
hand
both
foresail
and
mainsail
cast
off
the
topsail
sheets
clew
garnets
leechlines
and
buntlines
the
order
came
thinly
through
the
roar
of
the
wind
yea
yea
a
shrill
voice
piped
stand
by
the
sheet
and
brace
come
lower
the
yard
and
furl
the
sail
see
that
your
main
halyards
be
clear
and
all
the
rest
of
your
gear
clear
and
cast
off
it
is
all
clear
lower
the
main
yard
haul
down
upon
your
as
the
yard
swayed
down
and
the
men
belayed
the
halyards
one
minute
staggering
to
keep
their
feet
the
next
minute
slipping
and
sliding
across
the
decks
the
captain
sharp
voice
holding
them
at
their
work
cut
through
the
gale
haul
up
the
clew
garnets
lifts
leechlines
and
buntlines
come
furl
the
sail
fast
and
secure
the
yard
lest
it
traverse
and
gall
was
a
fierce
gust
an
old
sailor
cried
to
phil
who
had
reached
for
the
rigging
and
saved
himself
from
going
down
to
the
lee
scuppers
we
best
look
the
guns
be
all
fast
i
mind
in
the
grace
and
mary
my
second
guinea
voyage
a
gun
burst
its
breechings
belay
the
fore
the
mate
thundered
and
leaving
his
tale
untold
the
old
man
went
crawling
forward
the
men
heard
faintly
the
orders
to
the
helmsman
hard
right
your
helm
now
port
port
hard
more
hands
he
can
not
put
up
the
helm
then
out
of
the
turmoil
and
confusion
a
great
voice
cried
a
sail
a
sail
where
fair
by
us
how
stands
she
to
the
she
lay
close
hauled
by
the
wind
and
as
the
rose
of
devon
scudding
before
the
sea
bore
down
the
wind
and
upon
her
she
hove
out
signs
to
speak
but
though
captain
candle
passed
under
her
lee
as
near
as
he
dared
venture
and
learned
by
lusty
shouting
that
she
was
an
english
ship
from
the
east
indies
which
begged
the
rose
of
devon
for
sake
to
spare
them
some
provisions
since
they
were
eighty
persons
on
board
who
were
ready
to
perish
for
food
and
water
the
seas
ran
so
high
that
neither
the
one
vessel
nor
the
other
dared
hoist
out
a
boat
and
parting
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
lost
sight
of
her
in
the
gathering
dusk
still
more
and
more
the
storm
increased
darkness
came
but
there
was
no
rest
at
sea
that
night
thanks
to
the
storm
and
the
labour
and
anxiety
it
brought
all
hands
martin
the
latter
part
of
that
day
escaped
the
duties
of
ship
liar
and
glad
was
he
of
the
chance
to
slip
unobserved
about
the
deck
with
no
reminder
of
his
late
humiliation
but
by
night
he
was
blue
with
the
cold
and
drenching
wet
and
so
hungry
that
he
gnawed
at
a
bit
of
biscuit
when
he
needed
both
hands
to
haul
on
a
rope
finding
phil
marsham
at
his
shoulder
and
still
resenting
bitterly
the
jest
to
which
he
had
fallen
victim
he
shot
at
him
an
glance
and
in
sullen
silence
turned
his
back
belay
a
line
of
struggling
men
tripped
and
stumbled
as
they
secured
the
rope
and
went
swaying
and
staggering
across
the
deck
when
the
ship
rolled
for
the
weight
of
her
towering
superstructure
and
her
cannon
would
set
her
wallowing
fearfully
in
the
merest
seaway
one
caught
up
the
end
in
loose
coils
another
having
fallen
got
clumsily
on
his
feet
and
staunched
his
bleeding
nose
the
rest
shivered
as
the
icy
wind
struck
through
their
wet
shirts
martin
again
turned
his
back
on
the
boatswain
and
hugged
himself
but
to
little
profit
although
his
fat
arms
covered
a
goodly
area
phil
laughed
softly
at
martin
show
of
spleen
and
was
about
to
warm
the
man
temper
further
by
a
thrust
well
calculated
to
stir
him
to
fury
when
the
ship
rose
with
a
queer
lurch
and
descended
into
a
veritable
gulf
they
saw
above
them
a
sea
looming
like
a
black
cloud
it
mounted
slowly
up
hung
over
them
curled
down
a
dark
tongue
of
water
and
before
the
rose
of
devon
had
righted
from
her
plunge
into
the
trough
broke
upon
the
ship
and
overwhelmed
her
the
waist
was
flooded
from
the
head
of
the
forecastle
to
the
break
of
the
poop
water
licking
across
the
rose
in
a
great
wave
that
drenched
the
captain
to
his
thighs
and
poured
into
the
steerage
room
momentarily
blinding
the
men
at
the
helm
for
in
those
old
ships
they
stood
with
their
faces
on
a
level
with
the
and
following
whipstaff
and
tiller
spilled
into
the
main
deck
and
hold
philip
marsham
as
the
water
washed
him
off
his
feet
made
shift
to
lay
hands
on
the
shrouds
and
though
he
had
no
footing
and
was
washed
far
out
over
the
side
his
grasp
was
strong
and
he
held
himself
against
the
rush
of
water
as
the
ship
rose
like
a
dog
shaking
its
head
and
coming
up
through
a
wave
in
very
truth
she
seemed
to
shake
her
head
and
struggle
up
to
the
black
night
above
but
as
phil
saved
himself
he
saw
martin
cowering
by
a
gun
and
striving
to
reach
the
breeching
and
as
the
ship
rose
the
lad
half
felt
half
saw
some
great
body
washed
past
him
and
over
the
side
there
was
no
one
beside
the
gun
martin
was
gone
though
a
man
were
a
knave
and
liar
phil
marsham
had
no
stomach
to
see
him
drown
thus
and
though
he
held
old
martin
in
contempt
and
bedevilled
him
night
and
day
yet
he
had
a
curious
liking
for
the
fellow
overhead
there
hung
from
the
maintop
a
loose
rope
he
faintly
saw
it
swinging
against
the
sky
by
a
nimble
leap
there
was
a
fair
chance
a
man
might
reach
it
and
if
it
did
not
part
an
active
man
might
by
a
stroke
of
fortune
regain
the
ship
all
this
phil
saw
in
the
falling
of
a
single
grain
of
sand
then
the
rope
swung
within
reach
of
his
hand
and
he
seized
it
spared
the
hazard
of
leaping
for
it
he
let
go
the
shrouds
and
swung
with
all
his
strength
out
into
the
night
swinging
high
over
the
sea
he
saw
for
an
instant
while
he
was
in
the
rose
of
devon
surging
away
from
under
him
the
single
great
lanthorn
was
burning
on
her
poop
and
dim
lights
in
forecastle
and
cabin
showed
that
those
parts
of
the
ship
at
least
had
come
up
through
the
sea
unflooded
he
thought
he
saw
a
cloaked
figure
like
a
shadow
on
the
then
he
slid
down
into
darkness
till
the
rope
burned
his
hands
then
he
struck
the
water
and
went
under
gasping
at
the
shock
for
the
sea
was
as
cold
as
a
mountain
stream
he
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
great
ship
now
looming
high
above
him
then
clutching
fast
the
rope
with
one
hand
and
wildly
kicking
out
he
felt
with
his
knees
what
might
be
a
man
body
with
his
free
hand
he
reached
for
the
body
he
snatched
at
an
arm
and
missed
it
then
felt
hair
brushing
his
fingers
and
tangled
them
in
it
and
gripped
it
he
went
down
and
down
then
the
drag
of
the
water
for
the
ship
was
scudding
fast
raised
him
to
the
surface
the
ship
rolled
toward
him
and
he
again
went
under
overshadowed
by
the
lofty
poop
which
leaned
out
so
far
that
notwithstanding
the
tumble
home
he
thought
the
poop
would
come
down
and
crush
him
the
ship
then
rolled
away
from
him
and
the
rope
brought
up
on
his
arm
so
hard
that
he
feared
the
bones
would
pull
from
their
sockets
but
if
he
died
in
doing
it
he
was
bound
he
would
hold
the
rope
and
keep
his
man
the
ship
rolled
till
he
bumped
against
her
side
and
was
lifted
half
out
of
water
help
he
cried
help
or
we
die
he
heard
voices
above
and
felt
the
rope
move
as
if
some
one
had
seized
it
then
the
looming
bulk
of
the
ship
rolled
back
and
drove
him
again
down
into
the
sea
he
had
no
wind
left
for
calling
when
he
came
up
as
once
more
the
ship
rolled
but
the
man
he
held
had
come
to
life
and
was
clinging
like
a
leech
to
the
rope
which
vastly
lightened
the
strain
and
some
one
above
was
hauling
on
it
for
a
moment
the
two
swung
in
air
with
the
sea
beneath
them
then
the
ship
rolled
farther
and
their
weight
rested
on
planks
and
hands
from
within
the
ship
reached
down
and
lifted
them
on
board
the
man
and
it
was
indeed
martin
coughed
like
one
who
is
deathly
sick
as
well
he
might
be
and
went
rolling
down
the
deck
with
a
boy
to
help
him
but
phil
having
kept
his
head
and
having
swallowed
no
great
quantity
of
salt
water
was
able
after
breathing
deeply
a
few
times
to
stand
alone
beside
will
canty
whose
hands
had
drawn
him
to
safety
and
to
perceive
that
waist
boat
capstan
windlass
and
sheet
anchor
were
washed
away
he
then
heard
a
pounding
and
shouting
aft
what
in
the
fiend
name
hath
befallen
us
he
demanded
is
even
worse
than
doth
appear
will
cried
the
sea
hath
a
free
passage
into
the
hold
between
the
timber
heads
they
are
pumping
with
both
pumps
the
captain
hath
ordered
the
mizzenmast
cut
away
the
better
to
keep
us
before
the
wind
hear
you
not
the
sound
of
axes
and
out
of
the
darkness
burst
the
mate
come
my
hearts
below
there
cram
blankets
and
hammocks
into
the
leak
yea
the
shirts
from
off
your
backs
and
then
to
the
pumps
to
take
your
turn
and
pray
almighty
god
to
give
us
sight
of
another
day
there
was
running
on
the
deck
and
shadows
passed
forward
and
aft
from
the
a
clear
voice
so
sharp
that
it
pierced
the
noise
of
the
storm
was
calling
port
the
helm
ease
her
ease
her
now
up
hard
up
ease
her
ease
her
as
the
boatswain
dropped
through
the
hatch
he
saw
very
dimly
the
captain
crouching
under
the
poop
his
cloak
drawn
close
about
him
there
was
wild
confusion
below
for
as
the
ship
rolled
to
starboard
the
sea
burst
in
through
the
great
gap
along
the
timber
heads
and
pushed
through
the
gap
and
into
the
ship
the
blankets
and
rugs
that
were
stuffed
in
place
though
the
men
leaped
after
them
and
came
scrambling
back
to
force
them
again
into
place
between
the
timbers
and
though
they
tore
down
hammocks
and
jammed
them
in
with
the
blankets
to
fill
the
great
opening
yet
as
the
ship
again
rolled
and
the
sea
once
more
came
surging
against
the
barrier
they
again
fled
before
it
and
again
the
sea
cleared
the
gap
and
came
flooding
in
upon
the
deck
it
was
a
sight
to
fill
a
brave
man
with
despair
the
more
hands
made
faster
work
and
though
the
labour
seemed
spent
in
vain
they
stuffed
the
gap
anew
but
now
when
the
ship
again
rolled
to
starboard
an
old
seaman
raised
his
hand
and
roared
every
man
to
his
place
and
hold
against
the
sea
stay
hold
fast
your
ground
come
bullies
hold
hard
good
fellows
see
we
have
won
they
had
perceived
his
meaning
and
braced
themselves
and
with
their
hands
they
had
held
the
stuffing
in
the
gap
until
the
pressure
ceased
which
was
more
of
a
feat
than
a
man
might
think
since
despite
their
every
effort
the
sea
had
found
passage
in
great
strong
streams
yet
they
held
to
the
last
and
when
the
ship
rolled
back
boatswain
marsham
cried
out
now
master
carpenter
quick
bring
great
nails
and
hammer
and
a
plank
or
two
yare
yare
yea
yea
the
carpenter
cried
and
came
running
down
the
deck
the
men
held
the
planking
and
the
carpenter
drove
home
the
nails
and
thus
they
made
the
plank
fast
along
the
timbers
behind
the
gap
where
it
would
serve
to
brace
the
stuffing
between
the
plank
and
the
stuffing
they
forced
a
great
mass
of
other
wadding
and
though
the
ship
rolled
ever
so
deeply
the
plank
held
against
the
sea
they
left
it
so
but
all
that
night
which
seemed
as
long
as
any
night
they
had
ever
seen
no
man
slept
in
the
rose
of
devon
for
they
still
feared
lest
the
sea
should
batter
away
the
plank
and
work
their
undoing
all
night
long
they
kept
the
pumps
going
and
all
night
long
they
feared
their
labour
would
be
lost
but
at
four
in
the
morning
one
of
the
pumps
sucked
which
gave
them
vast
comfort
and
at
daybreak
they
gave
thanks
to
god
who
had
kept
them
safe
until
dawn
the
storm
had
passed
and
the
sky
was
clear
and
phil
and
martin
met
at
sunrise
since
thou
hast
haled
me
out
of
the
sea
by
the
hair
of
my
head
quoth
martin
after
the
manner
of
one
who
swallows
a
grievance
he
can
ill
stomach
i
must
give
thee
good
morrow
chapter
ix
the
master
guest
a
sail
a
sail
the
seas
had
somewhat
abated
and
the
rose
of
devon
was
standing
on
her
course
under
reefed
mainsail
when
the
cry
sounded
the
vessel
they
sighted
lay
low
in
the
water
and
since
she
had
one
tall
mast
forward
and
what
appeared
to
be
a
lesser
mast
aft
they
thought
her
a
ketch
but
while
they
debated
the
matter
the
faint
sound
of
guns
fired
in
distress
came
over
the
sea
and
loosing
the
reef
of
their
mainsail
and
standing
directly
toward
the
stranger
the
men
in
the
rose
of
devon
soon
made
her
out
to
be
instead
a
ship
which
had
lost
her
mainmast
and
mizzenmast
and
was
wallowing
like
a
log
while
the
rose
of
devon
was
still
far
off
her
men
saw
that
some
of
the
strange
crew
were
aloft
in
the
rigging
and
that
others
were
huddled
on
the
and
when
in
the
late
afternoon
she
came
up
under
the
stranger
stern
the
unknown
master
and
his
men
got
down
on
their
knees
on
the
deck
and
stretched
their
arms
above
their
bare
heads
save
us
they
cried
in
a
doleful
voice
for
the
lord
jesus
sake
for
our
ship
hath
water
in
the
hold
and
we
can
no
longer
keep
her
afloat
in
all
the
rose
of
devon
there
was
not
a
heart
but
relented
at
their
lamentable
cry
not
a
man
but
would
do
his
utmost
to
lend
them
aid
hoist
out
thy
boat
and
we
will
stand
by
to
succour
thee
captain
candle
called
we
can
do
no
more
for
we
ha
lost
our
own
boat
in
the
storm
it
appeared
they
had
but
one
boat
which
was
small
so
they
must
needs
divide
the
crew
to
leave
their
vessel
part
at
one
time
and
part
at
another
and
the
seas
still
ran
so
high
though
wind
and
wave
had
moderated
that
it
seemed
impossible
they
could
make
the
passage
with
men
at
both
her
pumps
the
rose
of
devon
lay
by
the
wind
wallowing
and
plunging
and
her
own
plight
seemed
a
hard
one
but
the
poor
stranger
though
ever
and
again
she
rose
on
the
seas
so
that
the
water
drained
from
her
lay
for
the
most
part
with
her
waist
and
a
greater
sea
than
its
fellows
would
rise
high
on
the
stumps
of
mainmast
and
mizzenmast
her
ropes
dragged
over
the
side
and
her
sails
were
a
snarl
of
canvas
torn
to
shreds
and
a
very
sad
sight
she
presented
three
times
they
tried
to
hoist
out
their
boat
and
failed
but
the
fourth
time
they
got
clear
and
with
four
men
rowing
and
one
steering
and
seven
with
hats
and
caps
heaving
out
the
water
they
came
in
the
twilight
slowly
down
the
wind
past
the
rose
of
devon
and
up
into
her
lee
the
men
at
the
waist
of
the
ship
saw
more
clearly
now
the
features
of
those
in
the
boat
and
the
one
in
the
stern
who
handled
the
great
steering
oar
had
in
the
eyes
of
philip
marsham
an
oddly
familiar
look
phil
gazed
at
the
man
then
he
turned
to
martin
and
knew
he
was
not
mistaken
for
martin
mouth
was
agape
and
he
was
on
the
very
point
of
crying
out
holla
martin
yelled
the
man
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
looked
up
and
let
his
eyes
range
along
the
waist
of
the
ship
not
one
of
all
those
in
sight
on
board
the
rose
of
devon
escaped
his
scrutiny
which
was
quick
and
sure
but
he
looked
martin
coldly
in
the
face
without
so
much
as
a
nod
of
recognition
and
though
his
brief
glance
met
phil
gaze
squarely
and
seemed
for
the
moment
to
linger
and
search
the
lad
thoughts
it
then
passed
to
the
one
at
phil
side
it
was
the
thin
man
who
had
been
martin
companion
on
the
road
it
was
tom
jordan
it
was
the
old
one
martin
face
flamed
but
he
held
his
tongue
a
line
thrown
to
the
boat
went
out
through
the
air
in
coils
that
straightened
and
sagged
down
between
the
foremost
thwarts
a
sailor
in
the
boat
seizing
the
line
hauled
upon
it
with
might
and
main
the
old
one
hotly
cursed
him
and
bellowed
fend
off
fend
off
thou
slubbering
clown
thy
greed
to
get
into
the
ship
will
be
the
means
of
drowning
us
all
some
thrust
out
oars
to
fend
away
from
the
side
of
the
ship
and
some
held
back
but
two
or
three
hungering
for
safety
gave
him
no
heed
and
hauled
on
the
rope
and
struggled
to
escape
out
of
their
little
boat
which
was
already
half
full
of
water
the
old
one
then
rose
with
a
look
of
the
fiend
in
his
eyes
and
casting
the
steering
oar
at
the
foremost
of
them
knocked
the
man
over
into
the
sea
where
he
sank
leaving
a
blotch
of
red
on
the
surface
which
was
a
terrible
sight
and
brought
the
others
to
observe
the
old
one
commands
some
cried
save
him
but
the
old
one
roared
let
the
mutinous
dog
go
perhaps
he
was
right
for
there
are
times
when
it
takes
death
to
maintain
the
discipline
that
will
save
many
lives
at
all
events
it
was
then
too
late
to
save
either
the
man
or
the
boat
for
although
they
strove
thereafter
to
do
as
the
old
one
bade
them
the
boat
had
already
thumped
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
it
was
each
man
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
last
the
men
above
threw
other
ropes
and
bent
over
to
give
a
hand
to
the
poor
fellows
below
and
all
but
the
man
who
had
sunk
came
scrambling
safe
on
board
the
old
one
leaned
out
and
looked
down
at
the
boat
which
lay
full
of
water
with
a
great
hole
in
her
side
i
would
have
given
my
life
sooner
than
let
this
happen
he
said
there
are
seven
men
left
on
board
our
ship
who
trusted
me
to
save
them
indeed
i
had
not
come
away
but
these
feared
lest
without
the
master
you
should
refuse
to
take
them
what
say
ye
my
shall
we
venture
back
for
our
shipmates
looking
down
at
the
boat
and
at
the
gaping
holes
the
sea
had
stove
by
throwing
her
against
the
rose
of
devon
the
men
made
no
reply
not
one
will
venture
back
is
there
no
one
of
ye
madness
one
began
we
should
see
she
hath
gone
adrift
and
in
truth
her
gunwales
under
water
the
boat
was
already
drifting
astern
at
the
end
of
the
painter
which
a
rose
of
devon
man
still
held
there
dangled
a
piece
of
broken
board
let
us
bring
thy
ship
nigh
under
the
lee
of
mine
the
old
one
cried
to
captain
candle
it
may
be
that
by
passing
a
line
we
can
yet
save
them
it
grieves
me
sorely
to
refuse
them
aid
but
to
approach
nearer
with
the
darkness
now
drawing
upon
us
were
an
act
of
folly
that
might
well
cost
the
lives
of
us
all
mine
own
ship
is
leaking
perilously
and
in
this
sea
were
the
two
to
meet
both
would
most
certainly
go
down
the
old
one
looked
about
and
nodded
true
said
he
there
is
no
recovering
the
boat
and
darkness
is
upon
us
let
us
go
as
near
to
the
ship
as
we
may
and
bid
them
have
courage
till
morning
when
god
willing
we
shall
try
to
get
aboard
and
save
them
that
we
will
and
i
myself
will
con
the
ship
leaning
over
the
rail
tom
jordan
the
old
one
called
out
holla
my
hearts
the
boat
hath
gone
adrift
with
her
sides
stove
but
do
you
make
a
raft
and
keep
abroad
a
light
until
morning
when
god
helping
us
we
will
endeavor
to
get
you
aboard
perceiving
for
the
first
time
that
the
boat
was
gone
and
there
was
no
recovering
her
those
left
on
board
the
wreck
gave
a
cry
so
sad
that
it
pierced
the
hearts
of
all
in
the
rose
of
devon
whose
men
saw
them
through
the
dusk
doing
what
they
could
to
save
themselves
and
presently
their
light
appeared
working
the
rose
of
devon
to
windward
of
the
wreck
captain
candle
lay
by
but
all
his
endeavours
could
not
avail
to
help
them
for
about
ten
at
night
three
hours
after
the
old
one
and
his
ten
men
had
got
on
board
the
rose
of
devon
their
ship
sank
and
their
light
went
out
and
seven
men
lost
their
lives
the
old
one
standing
beside
captain
candle
had
watched
the
light
to
the
last
it
is
a
bitter
grief
to
bear
he
said
for
they
were
seven
brave
men
a
master
could
desire
no
better
mariners
is
the
end
of
the
blue
friggat
from
virginia
bound
for
portsmouth
wanting
seven
weeks
a
man
can
go
many
years
to
sea
without
meeting
such
a
storm
yea
three
days
ago
when
the
wind
was
increasing
all
night
we
kept
only
our
two
courses
abroad
at
daybreak
we
handed
our
main
course
but
before
we
had
secured
it
the
storm
burst
upon
us
so
violently
that
i
ordered
the
foreyard
lowered
away
but
not
with
all
their
strength
could
the
men
get
it
down
and
of
them
all
not
one
had
a
knife
to
cut
away
the
sail
for
they
wore
only
their
drawers
without
pockets
so
the
gale
drove
us
head
into
the
sea
and
stopped
our
way
and
a
mighty
sea
pooped
us
and
filled
us
and
we
lay
with
only
our
masts
and
forecastle
out
of
the
water
i
myself
being
fastened
to
the
mizzenmast
with
a
rope
had
only
my
head
out
of
water
yea
we
expected
to
go
straight
down
to
the
bottom
but
god
of
his
infinite
goodness
was
pleased
to
draw
us
from
the
deep
and
another
sea
lifted
up
our
ship
we
got
down
our
foresail
and
stowed
it
and
bored
holes
between
the
decks
to
let
the
water
into
the
hold
and
by
dint
of
much
pumping
we
kept
her
afloat
until
now
in
all
we
have
lost
eight
lives
this
day
and
a
sad
day
it
is
from
virginia
wanting
seven
weeks
captain
candle
mused
captain
jordan
stole
a
swift
glance
at
him
but
saw
no
suspicion
in
his
face
yea
from
virginia
you
shall
share
mine
own
cabin
but
i
fear
you
have
come
only
from
one
wreck
to
another
the
two
captains
sat
late
that
night
at
the
table
in
the
great
cabin
one
on
each
side
and
ate
and
drank
there
was
fine
linen
on
the
table
and
bread
of
wheat
flour
with
butter
less
than
two
weeks
from
the
dairy
and
a
fine
old
cheese
and
a
mutton
stew
and
canary
and
sack
and
aqua
vitæ
at
midnight
they
were
still
lingering
over
the
suckets
and
almonds
and
comfits
that
the
boy
had
set
before
them
and
the
boy
nodding
in
uncontrollable
drowsiness
as
he
stood
behind
his
chair
strove
to
keep
awake
the
murmuring
voices
of
the
men
at
the
helm
came
faintly
through
the
bulkhead
and
up
from
below
the
deck
came
the
creak
of
whipstaff
and
tiller
the
moon
shining
through
the
cabin
window
added
its
wan
light
to
the
yellow
radiance
from
the
swinging
lanthorns
and
stars
were
to
be
seen
so
completely
had
wind
and
weather
changed
in
a
night
and
a
day
that
save
for
the
long
rolling
swell
the
great
gap
where
waist
and
boat
and
capstan
had
gone
the
hole
stuffed
with
blankets
and
rugs
and
hammocks
the
stump
of
a
mizzenmast
and
the
rescued
men
on
board
save
for
these
a
man
might
have
forgotten
storms
and
wrecks
you
are
well
found
said
captain
thomas
jordan
tilting
his
glass
and
watching
the
wine
roll
toward
the
brim
yea
and
we
are
in
good
fortune
his
thin
face
as
he
lifted
his
brows
and
slightly
smiled
at
his
host
settled
into
the
furrowed
wrinkles
that
had
won
him
the
name
of
the
old
one
we
can
give
such
entertainment
as
is
set
before
you
his
host
drily
replied
francis
candle
was
too
shrewd
a
man
to
miss
his
searching
appraisal
of
the
cabin
and
its
furnishings
in
his
heart
he
already
distrusted
the
fellow
chapter
x
between
midnight
and
morning
through
the
main
deck
to
the
and
up
into
the
forecastle
there
drifted
smoke
from
the
cookroom
in
the
hold
which
was
the
way
of
those
old
ships
at
times
it
set
choking
the
men
at
the
pumps
it
eddied
about
the
water
cask
before
the
mainmast
and
about
the
riding
butts
by
the
heel
of
the
bowsprit
and
went
curling
out
of
the
hawse
pipes
it
crept
insidiously
into
the
forecastle
and
the
men
cursed
fluently
when
their
eyes
began
to
smart
and
their
noses
to
sting
there
were
seven
men
in
the
forecastle
and
martin
barwick
was
one
of
the
seven
although
his
watch
was
on
deck
and
he
had
no
right
to
be
there
philip
marsham
whose
watch
was
below
had
stayed
because
he
suspected
there
was
some
strange
thing
in
the
wind
and
was
determined
to
learn
if
possible
what
it
was
two
of
the
others
were
younkers
of
the
rose
of
devon
who
suspected
nothing
and
the
remaining
three
were
of
the
rescued
men
there
was
a
step
above
and
a
round
head
appeared
in
the
hatch
the
dim
smoky
light
gave
a
strange
appearance
to
the
familiar
features
ho
cook
martin
cried
and
thumped
on
the
table
come
thou
down
and
bring
us
what
tidings
the
boy
hath
brought
thee
in
the
cookroom
yea
though
the
cook
labour
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
ship
is
it
not
a
proverb
that
he
alone
knows
all
that
goes
on
slipping
through
the
hatch
the
cook
drew
a
great
breath
and
sat
him
down
by
the
table
she
was
the
blue
friggat
i
hear
and
seven
weeks
from
virginia
god
rest
the
souls
of
them
who
went
down
in
her
from
virginia
quoth
martin
either
th
art
gulled
in
truth
or
art
the
very
prince
of
liars
from
virginia
ho
ho
and
martin
laughed
loud
and
long
now
it
was
for
such
a
moment
that
philip
marsham
was
waiting
nor
had
he
doubted
the
moment
would
come
for
although
martin
had
gone
apart
with
the
men
who
had
come
from
the
foundered
ship
the
fellow
head
which
was
larger
than
most
heads
could
never
keep
three
ideas
in
flourish
at
the
same
time
to
learn
what
game
was
in
the
wind
there
was
need
only
to
keep
close
at
martin
heels
until
his
blunders
should
disclose
his
secrets
the
devil
take
thee
thou
alehouse
dog
the
cook
cried
in
a
thick
wheezy
voice
did
not
the
boy
bring
me
word
straight
when
he
came
down
for
a
can
of
boiling
water
with
which
this
captain
jordan
would
prepare
a
wondrous
drink
for
captain
candle
and
did
not
i
part
with
this
captain
jordan
not
with
a
yell
martin
tipped
back
in
his
chair
and
went
over
crawling
on
his
feet
he
put
on
a
long
face
and
rubbed
his
head
and
hurled
a
flood
of
oaths
at
the
sailor
beside
him
a
small
man
and
round
like
an
apple
who
went
among
his
fellows
for
he
was
one
of
those
the
rose
of
devon
had
rescued
by
the
name
of
harry
malcolm
nay
the
little
round
man
very
quietly
replied
i
fear
you
not
for
all
your
bluster
put
your
hand
on
your
tongue
fellow
and
see
if
you
can
not
hold
it
i
had
not
intended
to
tip
you
over
it
was
done
casually
and
why
perdy
thou
jam
thy
foot
on
mine
till
the
bones
crunched
i
have
thy
heart
blood
nay
the
man
replied
so
quietly
so
calmly
that
he
might
have
been
a
clerk
sitting
on
his
stool
you
have
a
way
of
talking
overmuch
fellow
and
i
have
a
misliking
of
speech
that
babbles
like
a
brook
it
can
make
trouble
martin
stopped
as
if
he
had
lost
his
voice
but
continued
to
glare
at
the
stranger
who
still
regarded
him
with
no
concern
it
is
thy
weakness
fellow
he
said
and
he
looked
very
hard
at
martin
it
may
yet
be
the
occasion
of
thine
untimely
end
for
a
moment
martin
stood
still
then
swallowing
once
or
twice
he
went
out
of
the
dimly
lighted
forecastle
into
the
darkness
of
the
deck
he
appears
the
little
man
said
addressing
the
others
to
be
an
excitable
fellow
alas
what
trouble
a
brisk
tongue
can
bring
upon
a
man
the
little
man
harry
malcolm
looked
from
one
to
another
and
longest
at
phil
now
phil
could
not
say
there
had
been
a
hidden
meaning
in
the
hard
look
the
little
man
had
given
martin
or
in
the
long
look
the
little
man
had
given
phil
himself
but
he
knew
that
whether
this
was
so
or
not
there
was
no
more
to
be
got
that
night
from
martin
and
he
in
turn
further
bepuzzled
by
the
little
man
words
and
after
all
not
much
enlightened
by
martin
blunder
left
the
forecastle
to
seek
the
main
deck
passing
the
great
cannon
lashed
in
their
places
and
leaving
behind
him
the
high
forecastle
he
came
into
the
shadow
of
the
towering
poop
on
which
the
lantern
glowed
yellow
in
the
blue
moonlight
and
continued
aft
to
the
hatch
ladder
already
it
was
long
past
midnight
he
imagined
he
heard
voices
in
the
great
cabin
and
although
he
well
enough
knew
that
it
was
probably
only
imagination
for
the
cabin
door
was
closed
fast
the
presence
of
the
old
one
on
board
the
rose
of
devon
was
enough
to
make
a
man
imagine
things
who
had
sat
in
mother
taylor
cottage
and
listened
to
talk
of
the
gentlemen
who
sailed
from
bideford
he
paused
at
the
head
of
the
ladder
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
more
an
hour
passed
there
were
fewer
sounds
to
break
the
silence
there
is
no
time
like
the
very
early
morning
for
subtle
and
mysterious
deeds
boatswain
marsham
was
asleep
below
and
captain
candle
was
asleep
aft
when
captain
jordan
arose
and
stretched
himself
and
in
a
voice
that
would
have
been
audible
to
captain
candle
if
he
had
been
awake
but
that
was
so
low
it
did
not
disturb
his
sleep
vowed
he
must
breathe
fresh
air
ere
he
could
bury
his
head
in
a
blanket
for
the
night
emerging
from
the
great
cabin
captain
jordan
climbed
first
to
the
poop
whence
he
looked
down
on
the
brave
old
ship
and
the
wide
space
of
sky
and
darkly
heaving
sea
within
the
circle
of
the
horizon
to
look
thus
at
the
sea
is
enough
to
make
a
philosopher
of
a
thinking
man
and
this
captain
thomas
jordan
was
by
no
means
devoid
of
thought
but
whereas
many
a
one
who
stands
under
the
bright
stars
in
the
small
morning
hours
feels
himself
a
brother
with
the
most
trifling
creatures
that
live
and
is
filled
with
humility
to
consider
in
relation
to
the
immeasurable
powers
of
the
universe
his
weakness
during
even
his
brief
space
of
life
whereas
such
a
one
perceives
himself
to
be
like
the
prophets
of
ancient
times
in
a
divine
presence
the
old
one
his
face
strangely
youthful
in
its
repose
threw
back
his
head
and
softly
laughed
as
if
there
high
on
the
poop
he
were
a
god
of
the
heathen
who
could
blot
out
with
his
thumb
the
ship
and
all
the
souls
that
sailed
in
her
his
face
had
again
a
haunting
likeness
to
the
devils
in
the
old
and
indeed
there
is
something
of
the
devil
in
the
very
egotism
of
a
man
who
can
thus
assert
his
vain
notions
at
such
an
hour
presently
descending
from
the
poop
and
with
a
nod
passing
on
the
the
officer
of
the
watch
he
paced
for
a
time
the
he
pretended
to
absorb
himself
in
the
sea
and
the
damage
the
storm
had
done
to
the
waist
but
he
missed
nothing
that
happened
and
he
observed
the
whereabouts
of
every
man
in
the
watch
edging
slowly
forward
he
stood
at
last
beside
a
big
man
who
was
leaning
in
the
shadow
of
the
forecastle
we
meet
sooner
than
you
thought
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yea
for
we
were
long
on
the
road
and
entangled
ourselves
wonderfully
among
those
byways
and
which
cross
the
country
in
a
manner
perplexing
beyond
belief
saw
you
your
brother
in
all
truth
i
saw
him
and
the
devil
take
him
the
old
one
laughed
softly
it
is
plain
thy
brother
hath
little
love
for
a
shipwrecked
mariner
quoth
he
yet
there
is
a
most
memorable
antiquity
about
the
use
of
ships
and
even
greater
gluttons
than
thy
brother
have
supped
light
that
worthy
seamen
might
not
go
hungry
to
bed
we
will
speak
of
him
another
time
what
think
you
of
this
pretty
pup
we
have
met
by
the
way
ah
thine
eye
darkens
methinks
thou
hast
more
than
once
felt
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
he
bears
himself
somewhat
struttingly
martin
hesitated
but
added
perforce
since
he
had
received
a
friendly
turn
he
could
not
soon
forget
yet
he
hath
his
good
points
he
was
one
too
many
for
thee
nay
confess
it
th
art
a
filthy
rascal
martin
face
burned
with
anger
i
knew
he
would
be
too
cunning
for
thy
wits
truly
i
believe
he
is
a
lad
after
my
own
heart
i
have
marked
him
well
but
hast
thou
plumbed
his
inclination
with
thy
sounding
lead
why
no
at
worst
he
can
disappear
it
has
happened
to
taller
men
than
he
and
in
a
land
where
there
are
men
at
arms
to
come
asking
questions
hgh
this
for
thy
whining
though
we
shall
play
upon
him
lightly
some
are
not
worth
troubling
over
but
this
lad
is
a
cunning
rogue
and
hath
book
learning
came
you
in
search
of
this
ship
it
was
chance
alone
that
brought
us
across
her
course
chance
alone
martin
that
brought
your
old
captain
back
to
you
watching
martin
as
he
spoke
the
old
one
again
laughed
softly
yea
martin
it
touches
the
heart
of
your
old
captain
to
see
with
what
pleasure
you
receive
him
th
art
a
cunning
devil
martin
muttered
and
babbled
oaths
and
curses
we
must
sleep
martin
sleep
and
eat
for
we
are
spent
with
much
labour
and
many
hardships
and
it
is
well
for
them
to
sail
our
ship
for
us
a
while
longer
but
the
hour
will
come
and
do
you
then
stand
by
the
old
one
went
aft
the
ship
rolled
drowsily
and
the
watch
nodded
surveying
her
aloft
and
alow
as
a
man
does
who
is
used
to
command
and
not
as
a
guest
on
board
might
do
the
old
one
left
the
deck
chapter
xi
head
winds
and
a
rough
sea
lacking
the
mizzen
she
labours
by
the
wind
which
hath
veered
sadly
during
the
night
quoth
captain
jordan
in
a
sleepy
voice
as
with
his
host
he
came
upon
deck
betimes
i
like
it
little
the
master
replied
it
would
be
well
to
lay
a
new
course
and
sail
on
a
new
voyage
there
is
small
gain
to
be
got
from
these
fisheries
a
southern
voyage
now
promises
returns
worth
the
labour
to
this
captain
candle
made
no
reply
he
studied
the
sore
damage
done
to
the
ship
upon
which
already
the
carpenter
was
at
work
with
a
breadth
of
canvas
and
hoops
to
batten
the
edges
fast
and
over
all
a
coating
of
tar
a
man
might
make
her
as
tight
and
dry
as
you
please
said
the
old
one
he
smiled
when
he
spoke
and
his
manner
galled
his
host
it
was
in
my
own
mind
captain
candle
replied
with
an
angry
lift
of
his
head
there
are
few
things
more
grievously
harassing
than
the
importunity
and
easy
assurance
of
a
guest
of
whom
there
is
no
riddance
it
puts
a
man
where
he
is
peculiarly
helpless
to
defend
himself
and
already
captain
candle
patience
had
ebbed
far
bid
the
boatswain
overhaul
his
canvas
mate
and
the
carpenter
prepare
such
material
as
be
needful
aye
and
bid
the
stand
ready
to
go
over
the
side
cool
his
hot
pride
of
which
it
seems
he
hath
full
measure
yea
yea
as
the
master
paced
the
deck
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth
the
old
one
walked
at
his
side
for
he
was
a
shrewd
schemer
and
had
calculated
his
part
well
until
the
master
gorge
rose
i
must
return
to
the
cabin
he
said
at
last
and
overhaul
my
journal
i
will
bear
you
company
no
no
the
old
one
smiled
as
if
in
deprecation
but
as
the
master
turned
away
the
smile
broadened
to
a
grin
boatswain
marsham
and
the
carpenter
who
wore
a
beard
like
a
goat
were
on
their
way
to
the
forehold
the
cook
and
his
mate
were
far
down
in
the
cookroom
ten
men
in
the
watch
below
were
sound
asleep
but
martin
barwick
the
eleventh
man
in
the
watch
was
on
deck
of
the
eleven
rescued
men
not
one
was
with
captain
candle
safe
in
his
cabin
and
busied
over
his
journal
there
were
left
from
the
company
of
the
rose
of
devon
eight
men
and
the
mate
and
one
man
of
the
eight
was
at
the
helm
these
the
old
one
counted
as
he
took
a
turn
on
the
the
old
one
and
his
men
were
refreshed
by
a
night
of
sleep
and
restored
by
good
food
to
all
appearances
without
care
or
thought
to
trouble
them
they
ruffled
about
the
deck
one
was
standing
just
behind
the
mate
two
were
straying
toward
the
steerage
thy
boatswain
is
a
brave
lad
the
old
one
said
to
the
mate
and
stepping
in
front
of
him
he
spread
his
legs
and
folded
his
arms
the
mate
nodded
he
had
less
liking
for
their
guest
if
it
were
possible
than
the
captain
a
brave
lad
the
old
one
repeated
i
can
use
him
you
yea
i
the
mate
drew
back
a
step
as
a
man
does
when
another
puts
his
face
too
near
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
before
his
lips
had
phrased
a
word
the
old
one
raised
his
hand
and
the
man
behind
the
mate
drove
six
inches
of
blue
steel
into
the
mate
back
between
his
ribs
and
through
his
heart
he
died
in
the
old
one
arms
for
the
old
one
caught
him
before
he
fell
and
held
him
thus
well
done
the
old
one
said
to
his
man
not
so
well
as
one
could
wish
the
man
replied
wiping
his
knife
on
the
mate
coat
he
perished
quietly
enough
but
the
knife
bit
into
a
rib
and
the
feeling
of
a
sharp
knife
dragging
upon
bone
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
the
old
one
laughed
thy
stomach
is
exceeding
queasy
he
said
come
let
us
heave
him
over
the
side
all
this
remember
had
happened
quickly
and
very
quietly
there
were
the
three
men
standing
by
the
ladder
the
old
one
and
his
man
and
the
mate
and
by
all
appearances
the
old
one
merely
put
out
his
hands
in
a
friendly
manner
to
the
other
for
the
knife
thrust
was
hidden
by
a
cloak
but
now
the
mate
head
fell
forward
in
a
queer
lackadaisical
way
and
four
of
the
old
one
men
perceiving
what
they
looked
for
slipped
past
him
through
the
door
to
the
steerage
room
where
they
clapped
down
the
hatch
to
the
main
deck
one
stood
on
the
hatch
two
stood
by
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
and
the
fourth
stepping
up
to
the
man
at
the
helm
flashed
a
knife
from
his
sleeve
and
cut
the
fellow
down
it
was
a
deft
blow
but
not
so
sure
as
the
thrust
that
had
killed
the
mate
the
helmsman
dropped
the
whipstaff
and
falling
gave
forth
a
yell
and
struck
at
his
assailant
who
again
let
drive
at
him
with
the
knife
and
finished
the
work
so
that
the
fellow
lay
with
bloody
froth
at
his
lips
and
with
fingers
that
twitched
a
little
and
then
were
still
the
man
who
had
killed
him
took
the
whipstaff
and
called
softly
holla
master
we
hold
the
helm
then
from
his
place
he
heard
a
sailor
cry
out
the
mate
is
falling
lend
him
aid
then
the
old
one
voice
rising
to
a
yell
called
stand
back
stand
off
now
my
hearts
there
came
a
quick
tempest
of
voices
a
shrill
cry
the
pounding
of
many
feet
then
a
splash
then
a
cry
wilder
and
more
shrill
than
any
before
nay
i
yield
quarter
quarter
i
say
mercy
god
mercy
i
beg
of
you
help
o
god
there
was
at
the
same
time
a
rumble
of
hoarse
voices
and
a
sound
of
great
struggling
then
a
shriek
and
a
second
splash
the
man
at
the
helm
kicked
the
dead
helmsman
to
one
side
and
listened
in
the
great
cabin
behind
the
bulkhead
at
his
back
he
heard
a
sudden
stir
as
between
the
mainmast
and
the
forecastle
the
yells
rose
louder
the
great
cabin
door
burst
open
and
out
rushed
captain
francis
candle
in
a
rich
waist
with
broad
cuffs
at
his
wrists
his
hair
new
oiled
with
jessamine
butter
and
gallant
bows
at
his
knees
for
he
was
a
fine
gentleman
who
had
first
gone
to
sea
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
service
as
he
rushed
out
the
door
the
man
lying
in
wait
on
the
left
struck
a
fierce
blow
to
stab
him
but
the
knife
point
broke
on
a
steel
plate
which
it
seemed
captain
candle
wore
concealed
to
foil
just
such
dastardly
work
thereupon
turning
like
a
flash
captain
candle
spitted
the
scoundrel
with
his
sword
but
the
man
lying
in
wait
on
the
right
of
the
door
saw
his
fellow
blow
fail
and
perceived
the
reason
and
leaping
on
the
captain
from
behind
he
seized
his
oiled
hair
with
one
hand
and
hauled
back
his
head
and
reaching
forward
with
the
other
hand
drove
a
knife
into
the
captain
bare
throat
dark
blood
from
a
severed
vein
streamed
out
over
captain
collar
and
his
gay
waist
he
coughed
and
his
eyes
grew
dull
he
let
go
his
sword
which
remained
stuck
through
the
body
of
the
man
who
had
first
struck
at
him
clapped
his
hand
to
his
neck
and
went
down
in
a
heap
the
yells
on
deck
had
ceased
and
the
man
who
had
killed
francis
candle
after
glancing
into
the
great
cabin
where
the
captain
cloak
lay
spread
over
the
chair
from
which
he
rose
to
step
out
of
his
door
and
die
where
the
captain
pen
lay
across
the
pages
of
the
open
journal
and
a
bottle
of
the
captain
wine
which
he
had
that
morning
shared
with
his
guest
captain
thomas
jordan
stood
beside
the
unstoppered
bottle
of
ink
walked
forth
upon
the
deck
and
nodded
to
the
old
one
who
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
after
swivel
gun
there
were
a
few
splotches
of
blood
on
the
deck
and
three
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
crew
lay
huddled
in
a
heap
there
were
left
standing
three
other
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
and
sick
enough
they
looked
martin
barwick
was
stationed
by
the
ladder
to
the
forecastle
where
he
stood
like
a
pigeon
cock
with
his
head
haughtily
in
the
air
and
his
chest
thrust
out
and
the
little
round
apple
of
a
man
harry
malcolm
who
had
broken
in
upon
martin
the
night
before
bearing
now
a
new
and
bloody
gash
across
his
forehead
was
prowling
among
the
guns
and
tapping
the
breech
rings
with
a
knowing
air
the
old
one
from
the
looked
down
at
the
new
comer
rab
took
the
steel
the
fellow
said
rab
the
old
one
cried
not
rab
you
say
yea
he
struck
first
but
the
master
wore
an
iron
shirt
which
turned
the
point
and
he
was
then
at
him
with
his
sword
we
have
lost
nine
good
men
by
this
storm
but
of
them
all
rab
is
the
one
i
am
most
loath
to
see
go
to
the
sharks
the
old
one
paced
the
deck
a
while
and
the
others
talked
in
undertones
yea
martin
he
called
at
last
nine
good
men
but
we
have
got
us
a
ship
and
i
have
great
hopes
of
our
boatswain
who
may
yet
make
us
two
of
rab
at
all
events
my
bullies
we
must
lay
us
a
new
course
for
i
have
no
liking
of
these
northern
fisheries
hark
they
are
pounding
on
the
hatch
the
sound
of
knocking
and
a
muffled
calling
came
from
the
main
hatch
whereat
the
men
on
deck
looked
at
one
another
and
some
of
them
smiled
it
were
well
the
little
round
man
began
he
glanced
at
the
huddled
bodies
and
shrugged
true
true
the
old
one
replied
for
he
needed
no
words
to
complete
the
meaning
you
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
heave
them
into
the
sea
the
three
looked
at
one
another
and
hesitated
and
the
youngest
of
the
three
turned
away
his
face
and
put
his
hand
on
his
belly
and
sick
enough
he
looked
at
which
a
great
laugh
went
up
go
harry
the
old
one
cried
to
the
little
round
man
and
tell
them
at
the
hatch
to
be
still
for
that
we
shall
presently
have
them
on
deck
we
must
learn
our
brave
recruits
a
lesson
again
a
roar
of
laughter
rose
and
as
the
little
man
went
in
to
the
hatch
the
others
drew
about
the
three
who
cowered
against
the
forecastle
ladder
as
well
they
might
come
silly
dogs
said
the
old
one
in
faith
you
must
earn
your
foolish
lives
lay
hands
on
those
carcasses
and
heave
them
to
the
fishes
they
looked
into
the
faces
of
the
men
about
them
but
got
small
comfort
as
they
edged
toward
their
unwelcome
task
it
is
hard
to
use
thus
a
shipmate
of
three
voyages
the
oldest
of
them
muttered
true
replied
the
old
one
but
so
shall
you
buy
your
way
into
a
goodlier
company
of
shipmates
who
traffic
in
richer
cargoes
than
pickled
codfish
and
new
england
herrings
the
three
picked
up
the
bodies
one
at
a
time
each
with
its
arms
and
legs
dragging
and
carried
them
to
the
waist
and
pushed
them
over
but
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
trembling
like
a
dead
weed
in
november
when
they
had
finished
and
the
old
one
chuckled
to
see
the
white
face
have
courage
bawcock
the
old
one
cried
there
shall
soon
be
a
round
of
aqua
vitæ
to
warm
thy
shaking
limbs
and
send
the
blood
coursing
through
thy
veins
now
mate
harry
lift
off
the
hatch
and
summon
our
good
boatswain
and
carpenter
as
you
please
as
you
please
came
the
quick
gentle
voice
of
the
little
round
man
but
there
are
two
of
left
still
rab
and
the
captain
and
there
a
deal
of
blood
hereabouts
they
heard
the
hatch
creak
as
the
little
man
pried
it
off
they
heard
his
quick
sentences
pattering
out
one
after
another
hasten
out
on
deck
nay
linger
not
the
master
would
have
speech
of
thee
nay
linger
not
ask
me
no
questions
there
no
time
for
lingering
then
out
burst
phil
marsham
with
the
older
carpenter
puffing
at
his
heels
what
afoot
cried
phil
where
the
master
what
where
so
speedily
had
they
hurried
from
the
hatch
and
so
cleverly
had
the
little
round
man
interposed
himself
between
the
hatch
and
the
two
bodies
at
the
cabin
door
that
in
the
dim
light
of
the
steerage
room
the
two
had
perceived
nothing
amiss
but
now
looking
about
for
the
source
of
the
fierce
cries
and
yells
they
had
heard
they
saw
red
stains
on
the
deck
and
men
with
scared
white
faces
all
looked
toward
the
old
one
as
if
awaiting
his
reply
and
when
phil
marsham
too
looked
toward
him
he
met
such
another
quizzing
searching
understanding
gaze
as
he
had
long
ago
met
when
he
had
taken
the
words
from
martin
lips
on
the
little
hill
beside
the
road
why
i
am
master
now
good
boatswain
but
captain
candle
his
flame
is
out
the
lad
glanced
about
him
at
the
circle
of
hard
old
sea
dogs
for
they
were
all
of
them
that
were
their
years
few
or
many
and
drew
away
till
he
stood
with
the
waist
at
his
back
laying
hands
on
his
dirk
he
said
in
a
voice
that
slightly
trembled
and
now
why
quoth
the
old
one
you
have
sat
in
mother
taylor
kitchen
and
heard
talk
of
the
gentlemen
you
know
too
many
secrets
unless
you
are
one
of
us
he
finished
with
a
shrug
you
ask
me
then
to
join
you
yea
i
refuse
he
looked
the
old
one
in
the
eye
why
then
said
the
old
one
you
are
the
greater
fool
the
circle
drew
closer
what
then
is
but
another
candle
to
be
snuffed
with
hand
on
dirk
and
with
back
against
the
waist
the
boatswain
looked
one
and
another
and
then
another
in
the
eye
why
then
said
he
i
must
even
join
you
as
you
say
but
i
call
upon
you
all
to
witness
i
am
a
forced
man
and
he
looked
longest
and
hardest
at
the
three
men
from
the
old
crew
of
the
rose
of
devon
the
old
one
looked
back
at
the
lad
and
there
was
for
the
first
time
doubt
in
his
glance
he
stood
for
a
while
pondering
in
silence
all
that
had
taken
place
and
studying
the
face
of
his
boatswain
but
his
liking
of
the
lad
spirit
outweighed
his
doubts
for
such
bold
independence
whether
in
friend
or
foe
was
the
one
sure
key
to
tom
jordan
heart
so
be
it
he
said
at
last
but
remember
my
fine
young
fellow
that
many
a
cockerel
hath
got
his
neck
wrung
by
crowing
out
of
season
he
turned
to
the
carpenter
and
what
say
you
we
can
use
a
man
of
your
craft
i
am
thy
man
the
fellow
cried
the
stains
on
the
deck
had
made
him
surpassingly
eager
and
his
one
eye
winked
and
his
beard
wagged
so
eager
was
he
to
declare
his
allegiance
well
said
the
old
one
responded
and
now
master
harry
have
them
up
from
below
the
sleepers
and
the
cook
and
his
mate
and
all
we
have
taken
a
fine
ship
a
fine
ship
she
will
be
at
all
events
once
our
good
carpenter
has
done
his
work
and
well
found
we
needs
must
sign
a
crew
to
sail
and
fight
her
they
heard
the
little
round
man
calling
down
the
hatch
and
at
a
great
distance
in
the
ship
they
heard
the
voices
of
men
grumbling
at
being
summoned
out
of
sleep
but
the
grumbling
was
stilled
when
one
by
one
the
men
came
out
on
deck
and
of
them
all
not
a
man
refused
to
cast
his
lot
with
the
old
one
and
the
rest
the
mere
sight
of
a
little
blood
and
of
the
hard
faces
that
greeted
them
was
enough
for
most
and
two
or
three
of
whom
will
canty
was
one
must
fain
perceive
how
futile
would
be
present
resistance
indeed
in
the
years
since
the
old
queen
had
died
and
the
navy
had
gone
to
the
dogs
and
merchantmen
had
come
to
sail
from
the
downs
knowing
they
were
likely
enough
to
meet
a
squadron
of
galleys
lying
in
wait
fifty
leagues
off
the
lizard
many
a
sailor
had
taken
his
fling
at
buccaneering
and
those
that
had
not
had
heard
such
great
tales
of
galleons
laden
with
treasures
of
the
indies
and
with
beautiful
dames
of
spain
that
their
palates
were
whetted
for
a
taste
of
the
life
the
cook
smiled
broadly
and
clapped
the
boy
on
the
back
and
cried
out
that
as
a
little
lad
he
had
sailed
with
john
jennings
what
time
john
jennings
wench
had
turned
his
luck
and
that
having
begun
life
in
such
brave
company
he
would
gladly
end
it
in
a
proper
voyage
if
it
was
written
that
his
time
was
near
they
all
laughed
to
see
the
boy
turn
white
and
tremble
and
they
huzzaed
the
cook
for
his
gallant
words
but
will
canty
met
phil
eyes
and
there
passed
between
them
a
look
that
made
the
old
one
frown
for
he
was
a
man
who
saw
everything
the
rose
of
devon
although
by
the
wind
rolled
heavily
which
was
the
way
of
those
old
tall
ships
but
the
adverse
winds
and
high
seas
she
had
encountered
were
of
fancy
as
well
as
of
fact
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
sky
and
sea
were
a
clear
blue
but
despite
sun
and
sky
and
sea
no
weatherwise
man
could
have
believed
the
dark
days
of
the
rose
of
devon
were
at
an
end
like
so
many
iron
bars
the
shadows
of
the
ropes
fell
blue
on
the
sails
and
the
red
blotches
on
the
deck
matched
the
dull
red
paint
of
the
stanchions
and
the
waist
the
carpenter
who
had
come
up
with
his
plane
in
his
hand
fingered
the
steel
blade
the
boy
turned
his
back
on
the
bloody
deck
and
looked
away
at
the
sea
for
he
was
a
little
fellow
and
not
hardened
by
experience
of
the
world
come
my
hearts
cried
the
old
one
and
gaily
enough
he
spoke
we
are
banded
together
for
the
good
of
all
there
is
no
company
of
merchants
to
profit
by
our
labour
and
our
blood
god
hath
placed
in
our
keeping
this
brave
ship
which
will
be
staunch
and
when
our
carpenter
hath
done
his
work
harry
malcolm
is
our
mate
and
master
gunner
as
of
old
and
phil
marsham
shall
continue
as
our
boatswain
nay
grumble
not
he
came
with
martin
barwick
and
he
hath
sat
in
mother
taylor
kitchen
where
may
we
all
sit
soon
and
raise
our
cans
and
drink
thanks
for
a
rich
voyage
there
is
work
to
be
done
for
all
must
be
made
clean
and
tight
yea
and
rab
is
to
be
buried
the
little
round
man
was
still
wandering
from
gun
to
gun
and
smiling
because
the
guns
pleased
him
they
were
demiculverins
of
brass
bored
for
a
ball
and
fit
to
fight
the
king
battles
but
alas
they
had
shown
themselves
powerless
against
a
foe
from
within
the
ship
and
as
the
rose
of
devon
rolled
along
in
the
bright
sun
alone
in
a
blue
sea
the
body
of
francis
candle
lay
forgotten
in
the
steerage
room
chapter
xii
the
porcupine
ketch
looking
down
from
the
the
old
one
spied
the
cook
who
had
come
up
to
warm
his
bald
head
and
fat
face
in
the
sun
and
to
clear
the
smoke
from
his
nostrils
ho
cook
quoth
he
i
have
a
task
for
thee
break
out
from
the
cabin
stores
rice
and
currants
and
cinnamon
and
the
finest
of
thy
wheaten
flour
seek
you
also
a
few
races
of
green
ginger
it
may
chance
there
is
even
a
little
marchpane
for
this
man
candle
had
a
gentle
palate
spare
not
your
old
cheese
and
if
you
unearth
a
cask
of
fine
wine
fail
not
to
tell
of
it
in
a
word
draw
forth
an
abundance
of
the
best
and
make
us
such
a
feast
as
a
man
may
remember
in
his
old
age
the
cook
smiled
and
rubbed
his
round
paunch
yet
cringed
a
little
for
he
was
of
a
mind
being
never
slow
in
such
matters
to
filch
from
the
cabin
table
whatever
he
might
desire
and
his
heart
warmed
to
hear
the
good
victuals
named
yea
master
he
cried
for
thee
and
for
mate
malcolm
nay
thou
parsimonious
dog
think
you
that
such
are
the
manners
of
gentlemen
mariners
times
have
changed
though
i
be
master
there
is
no
salt
at
my
board
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
and
any
man
may
rub
his
shoulder
with
mine
the
old
one
own
men
chuckled
at
the
cook
blank
face
and
the
boy
shivered
when
he
thought
that
he
must
wait
on
them
all
of
whom
one
was
as
likely
as
another
to
fetch
him
a
blow
on
the
head
but
the
cook
went
down
below
and
they
heard
him
bawling
to
his
mate
to
come
and
help
break
out
the
cabin
stores
and
word
went
through
the
ship
of
what
was
afoot
and
though
will
canty
and
the
boatswain
meeting
glanced
dubiously
each
at
the
other
as
did
others
of
the
rose
of
devon
old
company
for
matters
are
in
a
sad
way
in
a
ship
when
the
master
feasts
the
men
all
the
foolish
fellows
were
clapping
one
another
on
the
back
and
crying
that
here
was
a
proper
captain
and
there
was
none
quite
so
mad
as
to
dispute
them
in
so
many
words
the
smoke
grew
thick
between
the
decks
and
after
a
while
there
rose
the
smell
of
baking
and
roasting
and
the
foolish
ones
patted
their
bellies
and
smacked
their
lips
they
whispered
about
that
the
boy
was
spreading
with
a
linen
cloth
the
table
in
the
great
cabin
and
that
the
cook
mate
was
staggering
under
weight
of
rich
food
and
when
the
cook
called
for
men
to
hoist
out
a
cask
of
such
nectar
as
poor
sailors
know
not
the
like
of
a
great
cheer
went
up
and
there
were
more
hands
to
haul
than
there
was
room
on
the
rope
the
old
one
leaning
on
the
poop
smiled
and
harry
malcolm
coming
to
join
him
smiled
too
for
they
knew
well
the
hearts
of
sailormen
and
did
nothing
without
a
purpose
so
the
table
was
laid
and
the
feast
was
spread
and
in
came
the
men
only
one
remained
at
the
helm
for
the
wind
was
light
which
made
light
his
task
six
remained
on
deck
to
watch
and
stand
by
with
harry
malcolm
curled
against
the
light
gun
on
the
to
command
them
and
the
cook
and
his
mate
resting
from
their
labours
far
down
in
the
hold
gorged
themselves
on
good
food
and
drank
themselves
drunk
on
nappy
liquor
from
a
cask
they
had
cannily
marked
for
their
own
among
the
cabin
stores
of
the
rest
all
that
could
find
room
crowded
into
the
great
cabin
and
all
that
could
find
no
room
in
the
cabin
squatted
on
the
deck
outside
the
door
on
the
very
spot
where
francis
candle
had
fallen
dead
they
sat
with
their
backs
against
bulkheads
and
stanchions
where
they
too
could
join
in
the
feast
and
the
council
and
the
boy
when
all
were
fed
gathered
meat
from
under
the
table
like
old
king
of
unhappy
memory
it
was
a
sight
to
remember
for
very
merry
they
were
and
save
as
they
were
rough
men
a
man
would
never
have
dreamed
they
bore
blood
on
their
hands
and
murder
on
their
hearts
the
old
one
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
took
care
that
neither
food
nor
wine
was
stinted
the
carpenter
his
one
eye
twinkling
with
pleasure
and
his
beard
waggling
in
his
haste
lest
another
should
get
ahead
of
him
at
trencher
work
sat
on
the
old
one
right
which
was
accorded
him
as
a
mark
of
honour
since
he
had
accomplished
marvels
in
restoring
the
planking
the
storm
had
torn
asunder
a
stout
seaman
of
the
rescued
men
paul
craig
by
name
it
was
he
who
had
needed
two
blows
to
kill
the
helmsman
sat
at
the
old
one
left
and
squared
his
big
shoulders
over
his
meat
and
ate
like
a
hog
till
he
could
hold
no
more
for
he
was
an
ox
of
great
girth
and
short
temper
and
little
wit
who
ate
by
custom
more
than
did
him
good
another
of
gaunt
frame
joseph
kirk
by
name
sat
smiling
at
a
man
here
and
a
man
there
and
tippled
till
his
head
wagged
and
off
in
a
corner
there
sat
a
keen
little
man
with
a
hooked
nose
who
was
older
than
most
of
those
in
the
cabin
yet
had
scarcely
a
wrinkle
to
mar
the
smoothness
of
his
shaven
face
save
above
and
behind
his
eyes
where
a
few
deep
lines
gave
him
the
wild
look
of
a
hawk
when
he
spoke
which
was
seldom
thick
gutturals
confused
his
words
and
always
he
sat
in
corners
does
not
a
man
looking
out
of
a
corner
with
a
wall
on
two
sides
of
him
and
no
one
behind
him
see
more
than
another
his
christian
name
was
jacob
and
most
of
them
knew
him
by
no
other
but
mocking
him
they
called
it
yacob
further
than
that
which
he
took
with
a
wry
smile
they
refrained
from
mocking
him
for
though
he
spoke
little
his
silence
said
much
the
old
one
rose
and
very
sober
he
was
as
he
held
high
a
brimming
can
and
so
steady
was
his
hand
that
not
a
drop
spilled
for
a
space
he
paused
and
looked
around
at
the
rough
company
seated
at
the
long
table
and
crouching
in
the
mellow
shadows
beyond
the
door
then
to
the
king
he
cried
those
not
knowing
him
well
who
stared
in
perplexity
at
such
a
toast
in
such
a
place
and
time
saw
his
eyes
twinkle
and
perceived
he
was
looking
at
old
jacob
in
the
corner
then
old
jacob
smiling
as
at
a
familiar
jest
rose
in
turn
and
raised
his
can
likewise
and
pausing
to
look
about
him
cried
back
at
the
old
one
in
his
thick
foreign
voice
the
king
and
his
ships
be
damned
a
yell
of
laughter
and
derision
shook
the
cabin
the
carpenter
leaped
up
first
then
such
of
the
rescued
men
as
were
not
too
drunk
to
stand
then
here
and
there
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
company
some
eagerly
in
all
earnestness
others
having
a
mind
to
keep
their
throats
in
one
piece
for
they
perceived
that
like
enough
the
unholy
toast
was
but
to
try
their
allegiance
the
old
one
eyes
leaped
from
man
to
man
and
his
cold
voice
cut
through
the
noisy
riot
of
drunken
mirth
i
had
said
will
canty
was
a
man
of
spirit
but
his
can
hugs
the
table
when
these
tall
fellows
are
drinking
confusion
to
the
king
a
a
have
him
away
my
hearts
to
the
halifax
engine
joe
kirk
bawled
with
a
drunken
leer
why
said
will
canty
and
his
face
was
white
but
with
a
red
spot
on
either
cheek
my
can
since
you
say
what
you
say
was
dry
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
am
no
prating
puritan
who
wishes
ill
to
the
king
over
the
rumble
of
voices
the
old
one
voice
rose
loudest
see
you
then
religious
cobblers
or
preaching
among
us
and
there
are
others
yet
besides
prating
puritans
mine
friend
that
drink
our
toast
cried
jacob
the
old
one
then
smiled
for
he
was
no
man
to
drive
a
nail
with
a
sledge
but
although
he
changed
his
manner
as
fast
and
often
as
light
flickers
on
running
water
under
the
surface
there
flowed
a
strong
even
current
of
liking
or
ill
will
as
sooner
or
later
all
men
that
had
dealings
with
him
must
learn
some
to
their
wonder
and
some
to
their
sorrow
enough
enough
said
he
will
a
good
lad
and
serve
us
well
when
there
powder
smoke
to
snuff
be
you
not
offended
will
in
all
faith
our
ship
is
a
king
ship
and
more
for
are
we
not
thirty
kings
to
fight
our
own
battles
and
heave
out
our
own
flag
before
the
world
and
take
such
treasures
as
will
buy
us
each
and
all
a
king
palace
and
all
the
wives
a
king
could
wish
nay
god
helping
us
my
hearts
we
shall
carry
home
to
good
mother
taylor
riches
that
will
serve
for
a
sponge
to
wipe
the
chalk
from
every
black
post
in
cornwall
and
in
devon
and
will
canty
shall
drink
with
us
there
there
rose
a
thunder
of
fists
beating
the
board
and
a
rumble
of
yea
and
the
old
one
made
no
end
of
smiling
but
there
were
some
whom
his
smile
failed
to
deceive
come
boy
with
thy
pitcher
of
sack
pour
sack
for
all
he
cried
come
ply
thy
task
and
let
no
man
go
wanting
fill
you
will
pot
he
gulped
down
a
mighty
draught
and
wiped
his
moustaches
with
thumb
and
forefinger
and
now
brave
lads
let
us
have
our
heads
together
though
we
lie
but
a
hundred
leagues
off
these
banks
of
newfoundland
what
say
you
shall
we
turn
our
backs
on
them
and
take
a
fling
at
a
braver
trade
or
shall
we
taste
of
fat
lobsters
and
great
cod
and
perchance
pluck
the
feathers
from
some
of
these
new
england
towns
concerning
which
there
hath
lately
been
such
a
buzz
of
talk
in
old
england
at
cape
ann
let
us
say
at
venture
or
naumkeag
or
plymouth
colony
yea
yea
i
am
for
cape
ann
cried
joe
kirk
and
his
head
rolled
drunkenly
above
his
great
shoulders
as
he
bolstered
his
opinion
with
curses
did
not
my
brother
go
thither
years
and
years
agone
for
the
company
of
dorchester
merchants
yea
and
told
rare
tales
of
succulent
great
fish
which
are
a
marvelous
diet
nay
thy
brother
was
as
great
a
sot
as
thou
a
voice
put
in
and
joe
rose
in
anger
but
a
general
clamour
drowned
his
retort
and
he
lapsed
back
into
a
sodden
lethargy
as
for
me
bellowed
martin
with
bluster
and
bravado
i
say
go
we
to
plymouth
and
rap
the
horns
of
these
schismatic
puritans
tell
me
not
but
that
they
mines
of
rich
gold
hid
away
ever
see
a
roundhead
knave
would
brave
the
wild
lions
of
america
unless
he
thought
there
was
gold
i
thou
thyself
art
fool
as
well
as
knave
quoth
the
old
one
thou
not
once
cry
the
whole
ship
company
out
of
sleep
to
see
a
mermaid
that
would
entice
thee
to
thy
peril
and
when
sober
men
had
come
on
deck
there
was
nought
there
but
a
at
play
lions
forsooth
in
africa
even
i
have
heard
a
lion
roar
but
not
in
america
much
searching
of
tracts
hath
stuffed
thy
head
the
drunken
joe
roused
sleepily
up
my
brother
saw
a
lion
at
cape
ann
plantation
my
brother
he
drew
a
knife
and
wildly
flourished
it
but
fell
back
in
a
stupor
before
the
laughter
died
martin
bluster
as
was
its
way
when
a
man
boldly
confronted
it
broke
like
a
pricked
bubble
but
his
sullen
glare
caught
the
old
one
eye
leaning
over
the
table
the
old
one
said
in
a
low
taunting
voice
and
did
you
never
see
a
man
dance
on
air
ah
there
a
sight
to
catch
the
breath
in
your
throat
and
make
an
emptiness
in
a
man
belly
as
often
happens
when
there
has
been
a
great
noise
and
a
man
speaks
in
a
low
voice
there
was
a
quick
lull
and
the
words
came
out
as
clear
as
the
ringing
of
a
half
crown
phil
marsham
looking
across
the
table
into
the
old
one
cold
blue
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
martin
saw
in
them
a
flicker
of
calculating
amusement
then
he
saw
that
martin
was
swallowing
as
if
he
had
a
fishbone
in
his
throat
in
truth
martin
wore
the
sickly
smile
that
a
man
affects
when
he
is
cornered
and
wishes
to
appear
braver
than
he
is
he
tried
to
speak
but
succeeded
only
in
running
his
tongue
over
his
lips
which
needed
it
if
they
were
as
dry
as
they
were
blue
come
come
we
get
no
place
yacob
yacob
they
cried
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
up
on
thy
feet
yacob
he
rose
and
stood
in
his
corner
his
long
hair
was
brushed
back
from
a
forehead
so
high
that
it
reached
to
a
great
lump
on
the
crown
of
his
head
his
brows
were
knit
with
intense
earnestness
his
big
nose
and
curled
lips
and
small
chin
were
set
in
what
might
have
seemed
in
another
place
and
another
time
scholarly
intentness
they
did
him
honour
by
waiting
in
silence
for
his
words
this
bickering
and
jangling
brings
us
no
place
shall
we
go
on
or
shall
we
go
back
shall
we
go
north
or
shall
we
go
south
those
are
questions
we
must
answer
now
i
will
tell
you
if
we
go
on
we
shall
find
little
fishing
ships
with
fish
and
no
chinks
and
we
shall
get
tired
of
eating
fish
if
we
go
back
in
this
fine
ship
that
god
in
his
goodness
hath
given
us
we
shall
hang
we
may
yet
go
back
to
mother
taylor
but
we
must
go
back
in
another
ship
you
know
why
now
brave
hearts
if
we
go
on
to
new
england
it
shall
profit
us
nothing
for
the
are
poor
they
live
in
little
huts
the
savages
come
down
out
of
the
woods
and
kill
whether
there
be
lions
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
care
those
savages
i
have
seen
and
they
are
a
very
ugly
sight
the
english
plantations
are
cold
in
winter
like
the
devil
they
are
poor
the
english
they
play
with
poverty
and
if
we
go
south
there
are
the
spains
they
have
sun
and
warmth
and
fruits
and
spices
they
have
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
stones
of
great
price
while
the
english
play
with
poverty
the
spains
play
with
empires
in
new
england
we
shall
eat
salt
cods
or
starve
which
is
much
the
same
for
salt
cods
are
a
poor
diet
but
in
the
south
we
shall
maybe
catch
a
galleon
with
a
vast
treasure
and
with
that
very
serious
and
sure
of
his
rightness
he
sat
down
yea
yacob
yea
yacob
they
bawled
and
delighting
in
the
alliteration
cried
it
again
over
and
over
paul
craig
heavy
with
sated
gluttony
piped
a
shrill
yea
yacob
and
the
old
one
pounded
the
table
and
grinned
for
he
had
sailed
many
seas
in
jacob
company
phil
marsham
nay
and
even
will
canty
too
pricked
ears
at
the
sound
of
spanish
galleons
for
the
blue
caribbean
and
the
blue
hills
of
the
main
were
fabled
as
all
knew
to
hold
such
wealth
as
according
to
the
tales
of
the
old
travellers
was
to
be
found
in
cathay
or
along
the
banks
of
the
first
of
the
four
rivers
out
of
paradise
and
was
not
a
spanish
ship
fair
prey
for
the
most
of
english
mariners
there
was
a
hubbub
of
talk
as
they
sat
there
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
they
were
of
one
mind
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
bleak
northern
coast
and
seek
a
golden
fortune
in
the
south
but
the
council
arrived
suddenly
at
an
end
when
down
from
the
deck
came
the
lingering
call
a
a
up
then
the
old
one
leaped
and
he
raised
his
hand
a
sail
is
cried
what
say
you
let
us
not
cast
away
what
god
hath
offered
us
yea
yacob
up
you
dogs
in
the
steerage
a
hall
a
hall
one
fell
over
on
the
table
in
drunken
torpor
another
rushed
out
the
door
and
tumbled
over
a
sleeper
at
the
threshold
up
you
dogs
how
stands
he
they
poured
out
of
the
cabin
to
the
deck
he
stands
on
the
lee
bow
bear
up
the
helm
a
fresh
man
at
the
helm
the
old
one
thundered
he
squinted
across
the
sea
come
harry
here
on
the
poop
and
tell
me
if
she
be
not
a
ketch
now
she
lifts
now
she
falls
be
a
chase
i
take
it
the
round
little
mate
came
nimbly
up
the
ladder
helm
said
he
in
his
light
quick
voice
which
at
first
the
helmsman
failed
to
hear
helm
man
art
deaf
the
courses
hide
her
there
she
lifts
yea
a
ketch
let
us
see
it
is
now
an
hour
to
sunset
if
we
stand
across
her
bows
and
bear
a
sharp
watch
we
shall
come
up
with
her
in
early
evening
and
a
very
proper
moment
it
will
be
his
light
incisive
speech
so
unlike
the
boisterous
ranting
of
the
old
one
in
its
own
way
curiously
influenced
even
the
old
one
himself
a
man
who
has
a
trick
of
getting
at
sound
reasons
unmoved
by
bluster
or
emotion
can
hold
his
own
in
any
company
and
many
a
quiet
voice
can
fire
a
ship
crew
to
action
as
a
slow
match
fires
a
cannon
now
young
men
martin
roared
up
aloft
and
loose
fore
and
main
topsails
and
oh
that
our
stout
mizzenmast
were
standing
yet
no
no
no
cried
harry
malcolm
and
he
almost
raised
his
voice
thy
haste
thou
fool
would
work
the
end
of
us
all
think
you
if
they
see
us
fling
every
sail
to
the
wind
they
will
abide
our
coming
without
charging
their
guns
and
stationing
every
gunner
with
linstock
and
lighted
match
nay
though
she
be
but
a
ketch
let
us
go
limping
across
her
bows
as
lame
as
a
pipped
hen
true
and
with
every
man
lying
by
the
side
of
his
gun
where
they
shall
not
see
him
until
we
haul
up
the
ports
and
show
the
teeth
of
the
good
ship
it
was
jacob
who
spoke
thus
as
he
climbed
to
harry
malcolm
side
the
old
one
looking
down
at
the
deck
below
touched
his
mate
arm
yea
i
see
them
what
do
you
want
it
seems
said
the
old
one
that
our
boatswain
hath
a
liking
for
the
fellow
and
that
the
fellow
hath
a
liking
for
our
boatswain
think
you
well
jacob
thrust
his
long
nose
between
them
you
say
by
which
you
mean
well
it
proves
nothing
that
a
man
will
not
drink
damnation
to
a
king
the
three
heads
met
high
on
the
poop
and
now
and
again
they
glanced
down
at
the
two
lads
who
stood
by
the
waist
and
watched
the
distant
sail
which
grew
black
as
the
sun
set
behind
it
the
sun
set
and
the
sea
darkened
and
a
light
flamed
up
on
board
the
chase
which
appeared
to
show
her
good
faith
by
standing
toward
the
rose
of
devon
there
was
a
rumble
of
laughter
among
the
men
when
they
perceived
she
had
changed
her
course
the
sober
wrung
oaths
from
the
drunk
by
dashing
bucketfuls
of
cold
water
in
their
faces
the
gunners
moved
like
shadows
among
the
guns
and
high
on
the
poop
three
shadows
again
merged
into
one
master
boatswain
the
old
one
called
but
softly
do
thou
take
it
upon
thyself
although
it
lies
outside
thine
own
province
to
make
sure
that
powder
and
balls
and
sponges
and
ladles
and
rammers
are
laid
ready
hunching
his
bent
shoulders
mate
malcolm
came
nimbly
down
the
ladder
and
from
the
chest
of
arms
drew
forth
muskets
and
pistols
come
my
bullies
below
there
knock
open
your
ports
it
was
the
old
one
voice
but
so
softly
and
briskly
did
he
speak
that
it
might
have
been
harry
malcolm
as
the
dim
figures
on
deck
moved
cautiously
about
the
subdued
voice
again
floated
down
to
them
let
all
the
guns
be
loose
in
tackles
and
stand
by
to
run
them
out
when
the
word
is
given
port
your
helm
every
man
to
his
quarters
now
my
hearts
be
ready
to
show
your
courage
and
we
have
this
wandering
ketch
for
a
consort
to
our
good
rose
of
devon
then
harry
malcolm
came
in
haste
along
the
deck
who
to
this
gun
and
who
to
this
nay
you
a
man
too
many
there
here
fellow
come
hither
here
a
man
is
lacking
you
there
who
are
playing
the
part
of
gunner
have
you
ever
heard
these
bulldogs
bark
and
understand
you
the
business
good
good
and
he
passed
on
up
the
deck
nought
escaped
him
in
the
silence
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
quick
pattering
of
his
feet
when
they
could
see
no
more
than
that
he
was
still
moving
among
the
guns
they
had
come
so
near
the
stranger
that
they
must
soon
hail
or
be
hailed
when
a
figure
emerging
from
the
steerage
room
in
the
darkness
came
upon
phil
marsham
by
the
ladder
and
gave
a
great
start
as
phil
turned
the
fellow
whispered
god
be
thanked
it
is
thou
i
thought
it
was
another
come
with
me
to
the
side
here
by
the
shrouds
the
two
stepped
lightly
under
the
shadow
of
the
to
the
waist
where
the
carpenter
had
nailed
in
place
new
planks
not
twelve
hours
since
and
together
they
raised
a
bundle
it
was
on
the
larboard
side
and
since
all
had
gathered
for
the
moment
to
starboard
to
watch
the
strange
ketch
there
was
no
man
to
observe
them
some
one
moved
above
them
and
they
hesitated
then
they
heard
slow
steps
receding
and
thick
undertones
that
they
recognized
as
jacob
when
he
had
gone
the
one
who
had
brought
the
bundle
whispered
heave
it
far
out
and
together
they
hove
it
still
in
the
shadow
of
the
the
two
slipped
silently
back
unseen
and
when
harry
malcolm
came
hurrying
from
one
side
and
jacob
from
the
other
to
see
what
had
made
the
splash
there
was
no
one
there
nor
could
any
man
answer
their
questions
have
you
done
as
you
said
phil
asked
in
a
breathless
whisper
that
i
have
and
it
was
will
canty
who
spoke
then
we
shall
like
enough
be
hanged
but
thou
art
a
tall
fellow
and
i
love
thee
for
it
there
came
over
the
water
a
voice
distinctly
calling
whence
your
ship
back
to
your
guns
ye
dogs
cried
mate
malcolm
in
a
voice
that
could
be
heard
the
length
of
the
deck
yet
that
was
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
on
board
the
stranger
of
england
the
old
one
called
from
the
and
whence
is
yours
there
was
a
space
of
silence
in
which
the
two
vessels
came
nearer
each
other
and
i
would
have
you
know
that
hearts
ever
so
courageous
were
thumping
at
a
lively
pace
and
yours
the
old
one
cried
the
second
time
there
came
voices
and
a
hoarse
laugh
from
the
stranger
then
are
you
merchants
or
men
of
war
of
the
sea
cried
the
old
one
in
a
voice
so
like
thunder
that
a
man
would
not
think
it
could
have
come
from
his
lean
throat
run
out
your
guns
o
my
hearts
let
him
have
the
chase
guns
first
the
chase
guns
the
chase
guns
now
one
bawled
down
the
main
hatch
and
another
below
echoed
his
cry
then
there
sounded
the
quick
from
the
bows
the
guns
had
spoken
and
the
fight
was
on
up
your
helm
up
your
helm
hold
your
fire
now
my
hearts
and
have
at
them
the
old
one
cried
and
now
the
voice
came
again
over
the
restless
sea
our
ship
is
the
porcupine
ketch
and
our
quills
are
set
the
dark
sea
tossed
and
rolled
between
the
vessels
and
little
that
happened
on
board
either
was
visible
to
the
other
so
black
was
the
night
but
the
light
of
the
sky
which
the
water
reflected
made
of
each
a
black
shape
as
of
jet
but
finer
than
the
most
cunning
hand
could
carve
in
which
a
man
might
trace
every
line
and
rope
and
now
from
on
board
the
ketch
jets
of
flame
burst
out
and
after
them
came
smartly
the
crack
of
muskets
now
lads
the
old
one
thundered
give
fire
and
make
an
end
of
this
petty
galling
give
fire
a
gun
on
the
boomed
and
another
followed
but
there
was
confusion
and
stumbling
and
all
were
slow
for
want
of
practice
together
and
there
was
time
lost
ere
the
third
gun
spoke
then
while
mate
malcolm
was
storming
up
the
deck
and
the
old
one
was
storming
down
they
heard
the
strange
master
calling
to
his
gunners
then
to
the
vast
amazement
of
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
who
had
cherished
the
delusion
that
their
chase
was
a
weak
craft
and
an
easy
prize
on
board
the
ketch
as
many
as
a
dozen
guns
belched
flame
their
thunder
shook
the
sea
and
their
balls
sang
through
the
rigging
and
a
lucky
shot
struck
the
rose
of
devon
in
the
forecastle
and
went
crashing
through
the
bulkhead
the
ketch
then
tacked
as
if
to
give
fire
with
her
other
broadside
but
deftly
swung
back
again
and
before
the
old
one
or
harry
malcolm
had
fathomed
the
meaning
of
it
there
rose
from
on
board
her
the
cries
of
bear
up
and
close
with
him
board
him
on
his
quarter
have
ready
your
graplins
sheer
off
sheer
off
old
jacob
roared
our
powder
is
good
for
nought
yea
she
is
in
all
truth
a
prickly
porcupine
if
we
foul
cut
anything
to
get
clear
cried
the
old
one
put
down
your
helm
veer
out
your
sheets
cast
off
weather
sheets
and
braces
aloft
there
and
clear
the
main
yard
where
the
cut
tacklings
foul
it
good
lad
boatswain
good
lad
for
on
the
yardarm
phil
had
drawn
dirk
and
cut
at
the
snarl
of
ropes
where
a
chance
ball
had
wrought
much
mischief
then
as
the
two
vessels
swung
side
by
side
he
looked
squarely
into
the
eyes
of
a
bearded
man
in
the
rigging
of
the
ketch
the
old
one
give
the
devil
his
due
was
handling
his
ship
in
a
proper
manner
and
by
luffing
he
had
kept
abreast
of
those
guns
in
the
ketch
which
had
spent
their
charges
but
it
was
plain
that
the
rose
of
devon
had
caught
a
tartar
in
all
truth
she
had
run
upon
a
porcupine
with
quills
set
for
though
a
smaller
vessel
the
ketch
it
now
appeared
carried
as
many
men
or
more
and
every
man
knew
his
place
and
duty
looking
down
on
her
deck
phil
saw
her
gun
crews
toiling
with
sponges
and
rammers
to
load
anew
she
was
herself
it
seemed
a
sea
rover
athirst
for
blood
and
in
those
wild
remote
seas
there
was
no
fraternity
among
thieves
as
the
main
yardarm
of
the
rose
of
devon
swung
toward
her
rigging
when
the
ship
rolled
the
bearded
man
ran
a
rope
about
the
spar
and
in
a
moment
the
vessels
were
locked
abeam
and
were
drifting
together
till
their
sides
should
touch
philip
marsham
again
drew
the
dirk
that
colin
samson
had
wrought
for
him
and
leaning
far
out
struck
at
the
fellow
breast
who
swung
back
to
avoid
the
thrust
which
pricked
him
but
did
no
more
then
the
fellow
sprang
to
the
attack
with
his
own
knife
in
hand
for
he
had
thrown
a
knot
in
the
rope
which
creaked
and
tightened
and
with
a
yell
of
triumph
he
struck
at
the
lad
who
swung
to
one
side
and
struck
back
it
was
a
brave
fight
in
the
empty
air
and
the
two
were
like
warring
spiders
as
they
circled
and
swung
in
the
darkness
and
thrust
each
at
the
other
but
the
lad
was
many
years
the
younger
and
by
so
much
the
more
nimble
and
his
dirk
for
which
all
thanks
to
colin
samson
smote
the
fellow
a
slashing
blow
in
the
thigh
and
while
the
fellow
clung
to
the
shrouds
weak
with
pain
a
second
man
came
crawling
over
phil
who
hung
below
from
the
yard
and
slashed
the
rope
we
are
clear
we
are
clear
god
be
thanked
the
old
one
yelled
meanwhile
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
had
succeeded
in
firing
three
guns
of
the
larboard
broadside
which
by
the
grace
of
divine
providence
wrought
such
ruin
in
the
stranger
running
gear
that
the
one
crew
of
rascals
was
enabled
to
escape
fit
retribution
at
the
hands
of
the
other
the
peak
of
her
great
foresail
fell
and
in
a
moment
her
cut
halyards
were
swept
into
a
snarl
that
needed
time
and
daylight
for
untangling
so
the
rose
of
devon
slipped
past
the
ketch
whose
men
were
striving
to
clear
the
rigging
and
come
about
in
pursuit
and
having
once
evaded
her
erstwhile
chase
the
old
ship
ran
away
in
the
night
with
her
lights
out
and
all
the
sail
spread
that
she
could
carry
and
favoured
by
clouds
and
fog
she
made
good
her
escape
but
there
was
grumbling
forward
and
grumbling
aft
and
there
was
a
dead
man
to
heave
over
the
side
it
served
philip
marsham
better
than
he
knew
that
he
had
fought
a
duel
on
the
yardarm
for
dark
though
the
night
had
been
there
had
happened
little
that
escaped
the
old
one
eye
and
bitter
though
tom
temper
and
angry
his
mood
he
was
always
one
to
give
credit
where
he
believed
it
due
when
he
wiped
the
blood
from
the
dirk
phil
remembered
with
gratitude
the
good
smith
colin
samson
then
he
thought
of
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
at
the
inn
and
of
nell
entick
and
bluff
sir
john
he
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
be
out
of
the
rose
of
devon
and
away
but
for
better
or
worse
he
had
cast
his
lot
in
the
ship
and
though
he
little
liked
the
lawless
turn
her
affairs
had
taken
a
man
can
not
run
away
by
night
from
a
ship
on
the
high
seas
all
hands
stood
watch
till
dawn
as
a
tribute
to
the
war
of
one
pirate
upon
another
and
not
until
the
sun
had
risen
and
shown
no
sail
in
sight
did
the
old
one
himself
go
into
the
great
cabin
chapter
xiii
a
bird
to
be
limed
a
lad
being
called
into
council
by
such
a
man
as
tom
jordan
might
well
think
himself
a
fine
fellow
and
rare
enough
were
lads
whom
tom
jordan
would
thus
have
summoned
but
although
philip
marsham
it
seemed
had
taken
the
old
one
eye
and
won
his
heart
long
before
on
the
little
hill
beside
the
road
when
phil
had
drawn
the
wind
from
martin
sails
and
although
it
had
not
escaped
tom
jordan
that
phil
hand
moved
easily
toward
his
weapon
the
old
proverb
has
it
a
man
that
flattereth
his
neighbor
spreadeth
a
net
for
his
steps
and
he
that
whistleth
merrily
spreadeth
his
nets
cunningly
and
hunteth
after
his
prey
greedily
so
come
boatswain
and
lend
us
thy
wits
cried
tom
four
heads
shall
provide
more
wisdom
than
three
and
with
that
he
clapped
phil
on
the
back
and
drew
him
into
the
cabin
where
jacob
and
the
mate
sat
deep
in
talk
of
the
night
adventures
a
hawk
when
she
is
first
dressed
and
ready
to
fly
said
jacob
is
sharp
set
and
hath
a
great
will
upon
her
if
the
falconer
do
not
then
follow
it
she
will
be
dulled
for
ever
after
so
master
a
man
yea
and
a
ship
a
great
will
sayest
thou
quoth
the
old
one
and
his
voice
revealed
his
sullen
anger
why
then
in
god
name
did
ye
not
rake
them
with
a
broadside
or
twain
with
which
he
turned
on
harry
malcolm
thus
to
include
him
in
the
charge
for
one
thing
replied
malcolm
and
testily
for
ill
temper
prevailed
both
aft
and
forward
we
gave
the
gunners
no
firing
to
learn
them
their
guns
for
another
thing
the
powder
failed
us
for
yet
another
since
you
say
what
you
say
and
be
cursed
for
it
a
mad
foolish
notion
to
run
afoul
a
strange
ship
for
we
have
but
a
half
the
company
we
need
to
work
a
ship
and
fight
and
finally
to
cap
our
woeful
proverbs
we
know
what
we
know
yea
and
he
shot
a
dark
glance
from
under
bent
brows
we
know
what
we
know
there
be
those
who
come
toward
us
with
their
feet
but
go
from
us
with
their
hearts
his
voice
as
always
was
light
and
quick
but
there
was
a
rumble
in
it
such
as
one
may
sometimes
hear
in
a
dog
throat
as
the
three
men
looked
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
there
came
to
boatswain
marsham
sitting
as
it
were
outside
their
circle
the
uneasy
throbbing
of
their
suspicion
of
the
powder
said
jacob
coolly
i
have
taken
a
little
from
each
barrel
he
laid
on
the
table
seven
packages
wrapped
in
leaves
from
an
old
book
regarding
closely
the
notes
he
had
written
on
each
package
he
opened
them
one
by
one
and
placed
them
in
a
row
this
said
he
is
from
the
barrel
that
good
harry
malcolm
served
out
to
the
men
and
that
doubtless
this
man
candle
hath
used
from
in
old
days
it
hath
lost
its
strength
by
long
lying
press
it
with
thy
fingers
and
thou
shalt
feel
it
soft
to
the
touch
here
upon
this
white
sheet
of
paper
i
lay
four
corns
of
this
powder
this
other
powder
and
he
chose
a
second
package
is
from
a
barrel
new
opened
press
it
and
thou
shalt
see
how
firm
and
hard
is
each
corn
and
this
too
is
firm
and
of
a
fair
azure
and
so
also
this
but
this
and
he
first
put
his
eyes
close
to
the
notes
on
each
remaining
packet
then
held
them
far
off
for
his
sight
although
good
at
a
great
distance
made
out
with
difficulty
things
near
at
hand
this
is
from
a
barrel
that
hath
lost
its
strength
by
moisture
and
this
hath
a
fault
i
shall
tell
you
of
taking
a
pinch
of
each
as
he
spoke
he
had
laid
the
corns
each
some
three
fingers
distant
from
the
next
in
a
circle
on
the
paper
he
then
struck
tinder
and
lighting
a
match
made
of
twisted
cords
of
tow
boiled
in
strong
and
saltpetre
he
held
it
over
a
corn
of
the
good
powder
there
was
a
flash
and
puff
and
the
ring
of
powder
was
gone
the
corns
of
good
powder
had
fired
speedily
and
left
only
a
chalky
whiteness
in
their
place
nor
had
they
burned
the
paper
or
given
off
smoke
but
the
corns
of
poor
powder
had
burned
slowly
and
some
had
scorched
the
paper
and
some
had
given
forth
smoke
the
old
one
softly
swore
and
have
we
then
asked
he
but
three
barrels
of
good
powder
nay
there
are
more
than
three
this
last
is
weak
because
they
have
neglected
to
turn
the
barrels
upside
down
so
the
petre
has
settled
from
top
to
bottom
as
is
its
way
we
shall
find
the
bottom
as
strong
as
the
top
is
weak
and
by
turning
the
barrel
we
shall
renew
its
strength
evenly
as
for
the
powder
that
hath
spoiled
by
long
lying
cried
philip
marsham
i
will
undertake
to
make
it
as
good
as
new
do
you
boatswain
mind
your
sails
and
cordage
said
old
jacob
with
a
wry
smile
an
you
wish
to
grind
it
in
the
mortar
that
you
may
but
it
is
i
who
will
measure
the
petre
nay
i
will
make
you
if
you
wish
it
for
a
wonder
to
show
friends
a
powder
of
any
colour
you
please
white
red
blue
or
green
of
the
three
who
leaned
over
the
packets
of
powder
old
jacob
was
the
only
one
who
bore
with
even
temper
the
sad
reverse
of
the
night
before
for
master
and
mate
glared
at
each
other
in
such
wrath
as
had
thrown
a
shadow
over
every
soul
in
the
ship
some
had
waked
with
aching
heads
for
which
they
had
their
own
folly
to
thank
some
were
like
men
who
dream
they
have
got
a
great
treasure
but
wake
to
find
pebblestones
or
worse
under
the
pillow
since
the
porcupine
ketch
had
yielded
them
no
gold
and
had
stung
them
instead
with
her
quills
in
all
truth
the
ship
was
by
the
ears
for
in
extremities
your
sea
sharks
are
uncertain
friends
as
a
touch
of
foul
weather
will
manifest
to
any
man
satisfaction
enough
of
this
said
the
old
one
and
he
pushed
aside
the
packets
and
folded
his
arms
we
lose
time
there
is
a
thief
amongst
us
a
thief
you
say
and
the
hot
red
of
anger
burned
its
way
across
the
boatswain
face
for
the
three
had
turned
and
looked
hard
at
him
the
old
one
and
harry
malcolm
then
exchanged
quick
glances
and
jacob
shut
his
small
mouth
tight
and
knotted
his
brows
well
cried
phil
would
you
charge
me
with
theft
some
one
said
the
old
one
lingering
over
each
word
hath
wrought
a
clever
plot
against
us
say
on
say
on
he
is
a
man
i
make
no
doubt
whose
buttons
are
breaking
with
venom
there
was
heavy
silence
in
the
cabin
jacob
pursing
his
lips
and
knotting
his
brows
looked
from
one
of
them
to
another
and
phil
vaguely
on
the
defensive
drew
back
and
gave
them
a
gaze
as
steady
as
they
sent
he
is
doubtless
a
very
cunning
rascal
harry
malcolm
put
in
who
hath
cut
his
cloth
by
his
wits
but
he
is
making
a
suit
that
will
throttle
him
by
its
narrowness
about
the
neck
the
master
and
mate
once
more
exchanged
glances
and
the
old
one
then
smiled
lightly
as
if
again
there
were
sunlight
rippling
over
dark
water
nay
philip
we
think
no
ill
of
thee
but
do
thou
have
care
to
thy
company
a
foul
trick
hath
been
done
with
a
mind
to
render
us
helpless
at
sea
so
that
we
must
crawl
to
the
nearest
land
where
some
base
dunghill
spirit
is
doubtless
of
a
mind
to
leave
our
company
but
we
have
resources
yea
and
of
thee
philip
we
think
no
despite
their
fair
words
though
they
were
watching
philip
marsham
like
three
old
tomcats
watching
a
sparrow
and
he
being
no
fool
knew
the
reason
why
three
hard
faces
they
showed
the
one
handsome
in
a
devilish
way
and
keen
the
second
unassuming
yet
deeply
astute
and
marked
by
a
deeper
rooted
if
less
frank
selfishness
the
third
older
wiser
more
the
eyes
of
master
and
mate
were
coldly
cruel
but
old
jacob
was
too
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
to
be
cruel
save
by
indifference
all
that
day
jacob
squatted
on
the
deck
and
toiled
with
tools
and
wood
from
the
wood
he
chose
certain
long
pieces
and
straight
and
dry
and
free
from
knots
and
certain
shorter
and
broader
pieces
that
were
suited
to
his
purpose
and
bade
the
carpenter
plane
them
smooth
he
laid
out
scales
working
with
a
small
square
and
a
pair
of
compasses
and
engraved
them
with
utmost
care
he
wrought
brass
into
curious
shapes
by
a
plan
he
made
and
from
morning
till
night
he
kept
at
the
task
frowning
and
ciphering
and
sitting
deep
in
thought
he
called
for
charcoal
and
a
mortar
and
beat
the
charcoal
to
a
fine
powder
and
tempered
it
with
linseed
oil
this
he
rubbed
into
the
wood
he
had
shaped
to
his
liking
and
watched
it
a
long
while
now
and
again
touching
it
to
try
it
then
with
oil
from
a
phial
he
had
found
in
a
chest
in
the
great
cabin
he
rubbed
the
wood
clean
and
there
were
left
in
the
wood
set
off
neatly
in
black
the
gradations
and
figures
he
had
so
exactly
etched
taking
his
work
into
the
great
cabin
he
toiled
on
by
lanthorn
light
until
a
late
hour
and
there
through
the
open
door
men
as
they
passed
might
see
him
hunched
over
the
table
with
his
medley
of
tools
about
him
but
when
at
last
he
leaned
back
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
very
serious
and
very
wise
his
work
was
done
and
curiously
and
deftly
contrived
it
was
on
the
table
before
him
there
lay
a
a
nocturnal
and
a
gunter
scale
with
which
said
he
to
the
old
one
who
sat
opposite
him
quietly
taking
tobacco
and
sipping
wine
and
with
what
instruments
the
thief
hath
left
us
a
man
can
navigate
a
ship
where
he
will
examining
closely
the
nocturnal
which
was
intricately
carved
and
engraved
the
old
one
muttered
as
if
ignoring
jacob
words
i
will
yet
lime
that
bird
though
he
be
never
so
mad
a
callant
i
misdoubt
he
will
put
his
head
into
a
noose
said
jacob
in
his
thick
serious
voice
be
he
the
one
we
think
or
not
the
one
we
think
i
will
set
him
such
a
trap
said
the
old
one
as
will
take
the
cunningest
fox
that
ever
doubled
on
the
hounds
and
the
thin
face
smiled
in
a
way
that
was
not
pleasant
to
see
chapter
xiv
a
wonderful
excellent
cook
if
an
astrologer
or
an
arabian
enchanter
could
say
to
a
man
beware
of
this
or
that
for
it
is
a
thing
conceived
of
the
devil
to
work
thy
ruin
there
would
be
reason
for
studying
the
stars
or
smiting
the
sand
and
this
indeed
they
do
according
to
the
old
tales
but
if
a
sailor
seek
out
an
astrologer
to
learn
things
that
shall
profit
him
he
is
more
likely
to
find
a
man
grown
foolish
by
much
study
who
will
stroke
his
chin
sagely
and
say
come
let
us
look
into
this
matter
under
capricorn
are
all
diseases
in
the
knees
and
hams
leprosies
itch
and
scales
and
schirrous
tumors
fallow
grounds
and
barren
fields
and
low
dark
places
near
the
ground
and
places
where
sails
and
materials
for
ships
be
laid
and
while
he
talks
of
fixed
angles
and
of
the
lord
of
the
ascendant
being
in
the
fourth
week
some
small
unsuspected
thing
may
be
the
very
egg
on
which
the
devil
is
sitting
like
an
old
black
hen
to
hatch
forth
a
general
calamity
thus
certain
incidents
that
shortly
thereafter
happened
are
to
the
point
for
although
they
appeared
of
little
moment
at
the
time
they
turned
the
tide
of
men
lives
and
made
a
stir
that
has
to
do
with
the
current
of
my
tale
now
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
sighted
a
sail
at
high
noon
when
they
were
a
week
on
their
way
south
and
though
she
showed
her
heels
and
ran
and
though
the
rose
of
devon
lacked
her
mizzenmast
the
strange
vessel
was
but
a
small
pink
and
so
slow
that
they
laid
her
aboard
two
hours
before
dark
in
her
crew
she
had
only
a
dozen
men
and
sorely
frightened
they
were
as
they
tossed
in
the
lee
of
the
dark
frigate
so
to
save
themselves
from
a
more
cruel
fate
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
but
leaped
at
the
chance
to
join
the
rose
of
devon
crew
they
tumbled
up
their
small
cargo
of
salt
fish
for
bilbao
and
hoisted
it
on
board
the
ship
together
with
their
shallop
and
casting
their
pink
adrift
they
forbore
from
complaining
when
their
new
master
and
his
men
stole
whatever
pleased
them
from
the
new
men
rings
and
knives
to
the
very
clothes
on
their
backs
so
with
her
plunder
and
her
recruits
the
rose
of
devon
again
squared
her
yards
and
continued
on
her
course
there
was
to
be
sure
one
fellow
of
mean
spirit
who
whined
dolefully
upon
conceiving
his
present
extremity
to
be
distasteful
but
another
got
comfort
by
knocking
him
on
the
head
when
no
one
was
looking
and
finding
him
dead
the
old
one
hove
him
and
there
was
no
further
trouble
from
the
fishermen
yet
it
was
no
secret
that
there
was
grumbling
and
complaining
forward
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
rose
of
devon
so
the
old
one
sent
the
boatswain
to
summon
them
aft
when
the
watches
were
changing
he
leaned
against
the
swivel
gun
on
the
and
looking
down
into
their
faces
smiled
disagreeably
it
hath
come
to
my
ears
said
he
that
one
hath
a
sad
tale
to
tell
because
we
failed
to
take
the
porcupine
which
though
a
mere
ketch
outnumbered
us
in
guns
and
men
and
another
hath
a
sad
tale
to
tell
because
this
pink
that
late
became
our
prize
is
small
and
of
little
worth
though
we
got
from
her
eleven
brave
fellows
who
shall
be
worth
a
store
of
fine
gold
he
looked
from
one
of
his
men
to
another
for
they
were
all
there
martin
and
the
cook
and
philip
marsham
and
will
canty
and
paul
craig
and
joe
kirk
the
carpenter
and
the
rest
and
his
thin
face
settled
into
the
many
wrinkles
that
had
got
him
his
name
there
was
none
of
them
unless
it
might
be
harry
malcolm
or
old
jacob
who
could
say
surely
at
one
time
or
another
what
thoughts
were
uppermost
in
tom
jordan
shrewd
head
come
now
my
hearts
of
gold
he
cried
let
us
have
an
end
of
such
folly
said
i
not
that
these
northern
fisheries
were
meat
for
crows
and
that
we
must
go
south
to
find
prey
for
eagles
we
will
choose
a
fine
harbour
by
some
green
island
where
there
rich
fruit
for
the
picking
and
fat
fish
for
the
catching
and
we
will
build
there
a
town
of
our
own
we
will
take
toll
from
the
king
of
spain
ships
we
will
take
us
wives
and
women
and
gold
and
wine
from
the
dons
of
the
islands
and
the
main
yea
we
will
lay
up
a
great
store
of
riches
and
live
in
fullness
of
bread
and
abundance
of
idleness
some
were
pleased
but
some
doubted
still
which
the
old
one
perceiving
for
he
read
their
faces
cried
nay
speak
up
speak
up
let
us
have
no
friends
with
hollow
and
undermining
hearts
yea
it
is
a
fair
tale
cried
one
in
a
surly
voice
but
thus
far
we
have
blows
to
show
for
our
pains
blows
and
a
kettle
of
fish
and
methinks
another
growled
we
shall
see
more
of
salt
fish
and
buccaned
meat
than
of
fine
wines
and
gold
and
handsome
women
is
a
swinish
thought
the
old
one
retorted
but
he
smiled
when
he
said
it
so
that
they
took
no
offense
for
of
such
grumbling
he
had
no
fear
he
was
set
to
catch
a
bird
of
quite
another
feather
then
old
jacob
rose
and
they
were
silent
to
hear
him
let
us
make
an
end
of
talk
said
he
slowly
we
are
on
our
way
south
and
to
stop
or
turn
aside
would
be
nothing
but
foolishness
and
with
that
although
they
had
expected
him
to
say
more
he
turned
away
then
of
a
sudden
come
will
the
old
one
cried
singling
out
his
man
from
all
the
rest
what
say
you
if
will
canty
face
changed
at
all
it
was
a
whit
the
paler
as
he
met
the
old
one
eyes
i
say
he
replied
that
since
we
have
fish
on
board
we
are
sure
of
fish
and
would
do
well
to
eat
fish
ere
we
lose
it
there
is
sooth
in
thy
words
quoth
the
old
one
and
he
smiled
in
friendly
wise
but
despite
his
smile
he
liked
the
words
little
as
any
shrewd
man
might
have
known
by
his
eyes
and
will
canty
was
no
fool
come
cook
and
boil
us
a
great
kettle
of
fish
the
rumble
of
low
voices
changed
to
laughter
and
the
cook
boldly
cried
yea
yea
master
for
our
much
voyaging
and
many
pains
cried
the
men
as
they
went
about
their
work
we
have
got
a
kettle
of
fish
and
they
laughed
mightily
for
though
it
was
the
very
thing
that
before
had
made
them
grumble
now
they
saw
it
as
a
droll
affair
and
made
of
it
many
jests
of
which
a
few
were
good
and
more
bad
after
the
manner
of
jests
as
for
the
cook
he
called
his
mate
and
bade
him
break
out
a
drum
of
fish
and
set
a
kettle
to
boil
and
cuffed
him
this
way
and
that
till
the
poor
fellow
ears
were
swollen
and
the
old
one
said
to
harry
malcolm
saw
you
not
how
deftly
the
fellow
twisted
out
of
the
corner
and
with
a
sly
remark
that
no
one
can
take
amiss
oh
he
is
a
slippery
dog
and
i
am
minded
to
cut
his
throat
out
of
hand
now
that
would
be
very
foolish
for
where
there
one
of
them
there
always
two
and
the
one
will
toll
the
other
on
until
there
are
two
dogs
by
the
heels
instead
of
one
at
that
the
old
one
laughed
harshly
and
the
two
who
were
after
a
fashion
uncommonly
congenial
went
off
well
pleased
with
their
conceit
down
in
the
hold
the
kettle
boiled
right
merrily
and
the
cook
swelled
with
pride
that
he
had
a
mate
to
carry
and
fetch
he
cuffed
the
poor
fellow
this
way
and
he
cuffed
him
that
he
threw
a
pan
at
him
when
the
fire
smoked
worse
than
common
and
he
thrust
a
fistful
of
flour
into
his
face
and
down
his
neck
when
he
let
the
fire
lag
he
flung
him
his
length
on
the
floor
for
spilling
a
pint
of
water
and
when
in
despair
the
lad
fled
for
his
life
the
cook
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
haled
him
back
and
put
a
long
knife
at
his
breast
and
swore
to
have
his
heart
blood
oh
the
cook
was
in
a
rare
and
merry
mood
for
he
had
drunk
more
sack
than
was
good
for
him
from
the
cask
he
had
marked
as
his
own
but
as
he
had
waxed
exceeding
gay
and
haughty
the
sack
had
dulled
his
wits
and
he
was
drunker
than
he
knew
come
thou
pig
thou
son
of
a
swine
he
yelled
ladle
out
the
fish
and
choose
of
the
best
for
the
cabin
yea
choose
in
abundance
and
summon
the
master
boy
and
bid
him
haste
and
do
thou
bestir
thyself
and
carry
to
the
men
and
with
that
he
fetched
the
poor
fellow
a
blow
on
his
head
which
knocked
him
off
his
feet
the
fellow
ran
to
do
the
work
and
the
cook
in
vast
satisfaction
at
having
so
well
acquitted
himself
sat
down
with
a
goblet
of
sack
and
tippled
and
nodded
and
kept
an
eye
on
the
master
boy
and
his
own
as
with
shrewd
fear
of
broken
heads
they
scurried
back
and
forth
it
is
most
wonderful
excellent
sack
quoth
the
cook
and
with
his
sleeve
he
mopped
his
fiery
bald
head
it
was
by
a
happy
stroke
i
marked
it
for
my
own
truly
i
had
rather
be
cook
than
master
for
here
i
sit
with
mine
eye
upon
the
cabin
stores
from
which
i
can
choose
and
eat
at
will
and
the
captain
nay
the
lord
high
admiral
of
england
is
himself
none
the
wiser
fish
sayest
thou
nay
fish
is
at
best
a
poor
man
food
i
will
have
none
of
it
and
thus
he
ran
on
foolishly
forgetting
as
he
drank
sack
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
not
even
his
mate
truly
i
am
a
wonderful
excellent
cook
i
may
in
time
become
a
captain
i
may
even
become
the
governor
of
a
plantation
and
take
for
a
wife
some
handsome
spanish
woman
with
a
wonderful
rich
dowry
she
must
have
an
exceeding
rich
dowry
if
she
will
marry
me
though
yea
i
am
a
wonderful
excellent
cook
and
the
more
he
drank
the
more
foolish
he
became
after
a
while
he
cocked
his
head
upon
one
side
and
quoth
he
i
hear
them
calling
and
shouting
it
seemeth
they
are
singing
huzza
for
me
i
hear
them
coming
down
to
do
me
honour
truly
i
am
a
most
wonderful
excellent
cook
and
the
fish
hath
pleased
them
well
foolish
ones
that
they
are
to
eat
it
the
silly
fellow
sat
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
smiled
when
they
burst
in
upon
him
hast
come
for
more
fish
he
cried
yonder
stands
the
kettle
nay
what
that
what
that
thou
sayest
nay
fellow
th
art
mad
thou
not
to
whom
thou
speakest
fool
knave
scoundrel
swine
they
yelled
oh
such
a
beating
as
thy
fat
carcase
will
get
hear
you
not
the
uproar
think
you
to
cozzen
us
with
that
they
seized
him
two
by
the
head
and
two
by
the
feet
and
dragged
him
to
the
ladder
they
threw
a
rope
about
him
and
knotted
it
fast
and
tossed
the
ends
to
men
at
the
hatch
above
who
hauled
him
squealing
and
kicking
like
an
old
hog
up
on
deck
to
the
cabin
they
dragged
him
with
all
the
men
shrieking
curses
at
him
and
pelting
him
with
chunks
of
fish
and
in
the
cabin
they
stood
him
before
the
table
where
the
old
one
and
harry
malcolm
sat
and
very
angry
were
they
all
dog
of
a
cook
said
the
old
one
for
a
relish
to
conclude
our
meal
we
shall
see
thee
eat
of
this
fish
that
the
boy
hath
brought
us
and
he
thrust
before
the
cook
a
great
dish
eat
it
every
shred
bones
and
all
said
he
or
i
have
thee
butchered
and
boiled
in
place
of
it
why
now
said
the
cook
somewhat
sobered
by
rough
handling
and
a
trifle
perplexed
but
for
all
that
still
well
pleased
with
himself
as
for
the
bones
they
are
liable
to
scrape
a
man
throat
going
down
i
am
reluctant
to
eat
bones
but
the
meat
is
good
i
rejoice
to
partake
of
it
for
so
diligently
have
i
laboured
to
prepare
it
that
i
have
denied
myself
yea
though
i
hungered
greatly
eat
said
the
old
one
and
widely
he
grinned
looking
suspiciously
about
him
for
there
was
something
in
their
manner
that
he
failed
to
understand
the
cook
thrust
his
hand
into
the
dish
and
took
from
it
a
great
slice
of
fish
which
he
crammed
into
his
mouth
eat
said
the
old
one
eat
o
thou
jewel
among
cooks
a
curious
look
came
over
the
cook
face
and
he
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
take
the
fish
out
of
his
mouth
nay
swallow
it
down
said
the
old
one
be
not
sparing
there
is
abundance
in
the
dish
yea
thou
shalt
stand
there
eating
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
though
he
smiled
his
look
made
it
plain
that
he
was
in
no
trifling
mood
the
cook
turned
pale
and
choked
and
gasped
water
he
cried
thickly
for
his
mouth
was
too
full
for
easy
speech
nay
much
drinking
hath
wrought
havoc
with
thy
wits
eat
on
eat
on
prodigious
were
the
gulps
by
which
the
cook
succeeded
at
last
in
swallowing
his
huge
mouthful
and
great
was
his
distress
for
the
salt
in
it
nearly
choked
him
water
water
he
weakly
cried
nay
temper
thine
heart
with
mercy
master
i
beg
for
water
i
beseech
for
water
eat
on
said
the
old
one
grimly
then
harry
malcolm
chuckled
and
the
men
in
the
door
roared
with
laughter
but
the
cook
plunked
down
on
his
fat
knees
and
thrust
out
both
his
hands
nay
master
i
can
not
hold
it
down
eat
on
o
jewel
among
cooks
nay
master
come
then
lads
and
cram
it
down
his
hungry
throat
three
of
them
seized
him
and
one
when
he
shut
tight
his
mouth
thrust
a
knife
between
his
teeth
he
yelled
i
eat
i
eat
they
let
him
go
and
he
rose
and
ate
time
and
again
he
gasped
for
water
and
they
laughed
time
and
again
he
lagged
and
the
old
one
cried
eat
on
when
at
last
he
stood
miserably
in
front
of
the
empty
dish
the
old
one
said
for
a
day
and
a
night
shalt
thou
sit
in
bilboes
with
a
dry
throat
which
will
be
a
lesson
to
learn
thee
two
things
first
before
cooking
a
kettle
of
fish
do
thou
bear
it
well
in
mind
to
soak
out
the
salt
so
that
the
fish
be
fit
for
food
and
second
by
way
of
common
prudence
do
thou
sample
for
thyself
the
dishes
that
are
cooked
for
the
cabin
they
haled
him
forward
and
locked
the
shackles
on
his
feet
and
placed
beside
him
a
great
dish
of
the
fish
that
whoever
wished
might
pelt
him
with
it
and
there
they
left
him
to
repent
of
his
folly
and
forswear
drunkenness
and
whimper
for
water
as
the
weary
hours
passed
the
sun
tormented
him
in
his
insufferable
thirst
but
nightfall
in
a
measure
brought
relief
and
he
nodded
in
the
darkness
and
fell
asleep
waking
he
would
rub
his
head
which
sadly
throbbed
and
would
seek
by
gulping
to
ease
his
parched
throat
and
sleeping
again
he
would
dream
of
great
buckets
of
clear
water
the
voices
that
he
heard
buzzed
in
his
ears
as
if
they
were
the
droning
of
flies
and
hunching
himself
down
in
his
shackles
at
one
end
of
the
iron
bar
he
forgot
the
world
and
was
forgotten
since
his
fat
carcase
lay
inertly
in
a
black
shadow
and
there
was
nothing
to
make
a
man
keep
him
in
mind
he
heard
at
last
a
voice
saying
but
nevertheless
it
becomes
you
to
walk
lightly
and
carefully
and
another
replying
i
fear
him
not
for
all
his
subtle
ways
much
that
goes
on
escapes
him
he
stirred
uneasily
and
opening
his
eyes
saw
that
there
were
two
men
leaning
side
by
side
against
the
forecastle
in
the
matter
of
wit
you
grant
him
less
than
his
due
said
the
first
speaker
and
in
another
matter
you
charge
him
with
a
heavier
burden
than
he
needs
bear
the
cook
stirred
and
groaned
and
the
first
speaker
chuckled
at
which
the
cook
gorge
rose
from
anger
o
jewel
among
cooks
one
of
the
two
called
softly
and
the
unhappy
man
knew
by
the
voice
that
the
speaker
was
philip
marsham
naming
no
names
and
talking
in
roundabout
phrases
as
people
do
when
they
wish
one
to
know
their
meaning
and
another
not
to
the
two
continued
with
no
heed
at
all
to
the
cook
whom
they
thought
a
mere
drunken
lout
and
indeed
their
undertones
were
scarcely
audible
but
anger
sharpened
the
cook
ears
and
his
wits
and
he
lay
and
ruminated
over
such
chance
sentences
as
he
got
it
puzzled
me
from
the
first
said
the
other
to
see
how
easily
you
bore
with
your
comrade
of
the
road
why
he
is
a
good
soul
in
his
way
the
other
gave
a
grunt
of
disgust
nay
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
that
a
lad
with
your
nice
notions
ever
found
his
way
to
sea
phil
retorted
and
i
might
never
have
gone
had
not
captain
francis
candle
been
my
godfather
as
for
me
i
have
seen
both
sides
of
life
and
but
for
a
certain
thing
that
happened
i
might
be
well
enough
contented
where
i
am
and
that
phil
hesitated
for
though
they
had
talked
freely
as
young
men
will
the
question
searched
a
side
of
phil
life
to
which
as
yet
he
had
given
no
clue
why
said
he
lowering
his
voice
for
one
thing
i
saw
for
the
first
time
my
own
grandfather
and
for
another
i
saw
a
certain
old
knight
who
quite
won
my
fancy
from
such
a
man
as
a
certain
one
we
know
come
let
us
stroll
together
and
as
they
walked
the
deck
that
night
arm
in
arm
phil
told
his
companion
what
his
life
had
been
and
what
it
might
have
been
and
mentioned
in
passing
the
girl
at
the
inn
left
to
his
miseries
and
his
thoughts
of
which
the
first
were
little
better
company
than
the
second
the
woeful
cook
turned
over
and
over
in
his
fat
head
such
fragments
of
their
talk
as
he
had
succeeded
in
overhearing
and
to
say
truth
he
made
little
more
out
of
it
all
than
the
speakers
had
intended
but
his
parched
throat
teased
his
wits
to
greater
effort
and
being
come
to
such
a
state
that
he
would
have
bartered
his
immortal
soul
for
water
had
chance
offered
he
bethought
him
of
a
plan
by
which
if
luck
held
good
he
might
escape
from
his
shackles
the
moment
for
which
he
waited
was
a
long
time
coming
and
he
suffered
a
great
variety
of
increasing
miseries
before
it
arrived
but
when
the
watches
changed
he
saw
among
the
men
newly
arrived
on
deck
his
erstwhile
dearest
friend
and
somewhat
reluctantly
forgiving
his
dear
friend
for
belabouring
him
over
the
head
with
a
whole
salt
fish
the
cook
softly
called
the
man
by
name
the
fellow
came
snickering
which
made
it
none
the
easier
to
bespeak
his
aid
but
the
cook
nevertheless
swallowed
his
wrath
as
well
as
with
his
dry
throat
he
could
and
whispered
to
the
fellow
that
he
must
make
haste
and
tell
the
master
there
was
news
to
be
imparted
in
secret
at
this
the
fellow
held
up
his
hand
with
thumb
thrust
between
first
and
second
fingers
give
me
no
fico
wailed
the
most
excellent
cook
nay
i
have
stumbled
upon
a
black
and
hidden
matter
go
thou
and
in
haste
and
it
will
pay
thee
well
for
a
time
they
bickered
in
the
dark
but
there
was
in
the
despair
a
sincerity
that
finally
made
the
fellow
believe
the
tale
and
finding
upon
stealing
aft
that
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
great
cabin
he
mustered
up
his
courage
and
knocked
enter
cried
a
hard
voice
the
fellow
opened
the
door
and
peeped
in
and
found
the
old
one
sitting
alone
at
the
table
glancing
hastily
about
and
the
more
alarmed
to
meet
the
cold
eye
of
harry
malcolm
who
lay
on
the
great
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
he
closed
the
door
at
his
back
and
whispered
he
swears
it
true
that
there
foul
work
afoot
is
the
cook
who
hath
told
me
yea
and
hath
bade
me
tell
you
he
would
say
no
more
the
cook
i
mean
oh
my
good
friend
our
most
excellent
cook
meditating
the
old
one
looked
the
fellow
up
and
down
here
said
he
strike
off
his
shackles
and
send
him
in
with
the
key
and
he
threw
the
fellow
the
key
to
the
locks
after
a
while
the
cook
came
weakly
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
throwing
the
key
on
the
table
fell
into
a
chair
ah
said
the
old
one
what
is
this
tale
i
have
heard
news
of
water
gasped
the
cook
for
though
he
had
managed
by
pausing
at
the
butt
on
his
way
to
drink
nearly
a
quart
he
had
no
mind
the
old
one
should
know
of
it
the
old
one
smiled
go
drink
if
thy
tale
be
worth
it
but
mind
if
i
deem
thy
tale
not
worth
it
thou
shalt
pay
with
a
drop
of
blood
for
every
drop
of
water
the
cook
shot
a
doubting
glance
at
the
old
one
but
went
none
the
less
and
came
back
wiping
his
lips
have
at
thy
tale
said
the
old
one
there
was
a
quaver
in
the
cook
voice
for
he
was
by
no
means
sure
of
how
great
a
tale
he
could
make
and
the
master
face
gave
him
small
encouragement
for
from
the
beginning
of
the
tale
to
the
end
the
old
one
never
altered
his
cold
cruel
smile
it
was
the
boatswain
and
young
canty
he
said
ah
they
was
leaning
on
the
forecastle
and
walking
the
deck
arm
in
arm
and
talking
of
one
thing
and
another
and
what
did
they
say
they
talked
about
some
one
slow
wit
i
could
not
make
sure
whose
for
they
scoffed
at
me
bitterly
and
canty
was
bepuzzled
by
the
boatswain
ways
and
he
wanted
him
to
do
something
or
other
go
on
the
old
one
grinning
coldly
leaned
back
and
watched
the
labouring
cook
who
wracked
his
few
brains
to
make
a
worthier
story
nay
but
i
heard
little
else
yet
said
i
the
master
must
know
at
all
costs
what
a
thick
head
is
thine
and
how
easily
seen
through
and
through
the
old
one
laughed
think
you
all
this
is
worth
a
second
thought
i
am
of
the
mind
to
have
you
skinned
and
salted
but
i
forgive
you
since
i
have
a
milkish
heart
that
is
easy
moved
to
pity
get
you
down
to
your
berth
and
sleep
the
cook
departed
in
haste
but
with
a
fleeting
glance
at
harry
malcolm
whom
he
feared
less
only
than
the
master
he
was
aware
that
for
some
reason
he
did
not
understand
his
broken
tale
had
served
his
purpose
when
he
had
gone
the
old
one
turned
about
you
heard
him
what
think
you
said
he
from
the
great
bed
in
the
corner
harry
malcolm
raised
his
head
and
laughed
silently
our
able
cook
was
hard
pressed
for
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
his
ankle
rings
did
you
hear
him
slopping
at
the
butt
the
first
time
passing
as
for
his
tale
we
know
what
we
knew
and
no
more
wits
i
wonder
at
baracao
we
shall
see
said
harry
malcolm
neither
one
nor
a
dozen
can
harm
us
before
we
raise
land
and
after
raising
land
which
by
god
mercy
will
be
soon
now
we
shall
see
whose
wits
will
nick
first
when
the
edges
crack
together
the
old
one
stretched
and
yawned
and
harry
malcolm
softly
laughed
chapter
xv
a
lonesome
little
town
a
light
seen
in
the
middle
watch
gave
warning
of
an
unexpected
landfall
and
calling
up
the
old
one
who
had
a
store
of
knowledge
gained
by
much
cruising
in
those
seas
they
lay
off
and
on
until
dawn
when
they
made
out
an
island
of
the
bahamas
it
seemed
since
by
their
reckoning
they
were
still
a
day
sail
from
land
that
there
was
some
small
fault
in
their
instruments
but
to
this
they
gave
little
heed
and
which
island
it
was
and
what
occasioned
the
light
they
never
knew
though
some
ventured
one
guess
and
some
another
as
they
bore
past
it
and
lifted
isle
beyond
isle
for
two
days
with
the
old
one
conning
the
ship
they
worked
their
way
among
the
islands
and
thus
at
last
they
came
to
a
deep
bay
set
among
hills
which
offered
a
commodious
and
safe
anchorage
notwithstanding
that
on
the
point
that
guarded
the
bay
there
was
the
wreck
of
a
tall
ship
in
the
shallop
they
had
taken
from
the
fishing
pink
the
old
one
and
jacob
with
four
men
to
row
them
went
out
to
the
wreck
and
returned
well
pleased
with
what
they
had
found
god
is
good
to
us
cried
the
old
one
perceiving
that
harry
malcolm
waited
at
the
waist
for
their
coming
though
her
foremast
and
mainmast
be
sprung
yet
her
mizzen
is
sound
as
a
nut
and
is
it
to
be
fetched
out
of
her
unharmed
yea
that
it
is
come
master
carpenter
haul
out
our
broken
old
stump
of
a
mizzen
by
this
time
on
the
morrow
our
good
rose
of
devon
will
carry
in
its
place
as
stout
a
stick
as
man
can
wish
faith
the
ill
fortune
of
them
whose
ship
lies
yonder
shall
serve
us
well
there
was
a
great
bustle
in
the
old
frigate
for
work
was
to
be
done
that
needed
many
hands
some
went
to
the
wreck
to
save
masts
and
spars
and
others
led
by
the
carpenter
toiled
to
haul
out
the
stump
boatswain
marsham
and
his
mate
laid
ready
ropes
and
canvas
and
the
most
of
the
company
being
thus
busied
with
one
task
or
another
martin
and
the
cook
caught
a
store
of
fresh
fish
which
the
cook
who
had
now
become
a
chastened
careful
man
boiled
for
supper
while
martin
went
onshore
for
fruit
that
grew
wild
in
abundance
and
for
fresh
water
from
a
sandy
spring
it
was
three
days
instead
of
one
before
the
work
was
finished
but
meanwhile
there
was
fresh
food
and
water
aft
and
forward
and
having
spent
at
sea
many
weary
weeks
the
men
rejoiced
to
pass
time
so
pleasantly
in
a
snug
haven
indeed
a
man
might
have
passed
a
long
life
in
comfort
on
such
an
island
and
there
were
many
who
cried
yea
when
joseph
kirk
declared
himself
for
building
a
town
there
to
which
they
might
return
with
a
store
of
wives
and
wines
and
from
which
they
could
sally
forth
when
their
supplies
of
either
got
low
and
get
for
themselves
others
out
of
the
king
of
spain
ships
and
plantations
but
the
old
one
laughed
and
cried
nay
i
shall
show
you
a
town
said
he
in
a
land
as
fair
as
this
but
with
houses
built
and
ready
for
us
and
with
gold
piled
up
and
waiting
and
with
great
cellars
of
wine
and
warehouses
filled
with
food
so
they
sailed
from
the
island
one
morning
at
dawn
and
for
a
week
they
picked
their
way
down
the
windward
passages
at
times
they
lay
hidden
in
deep
harbours
of
which
the
old
one
knew
the
secret
and
again
they
stood
boldly
out
to
sea
and
put
behind
them
many
leagues
of
their
journey
and
thus
progressing
one
night
as
they
worked
south
against
a
warm
breeze
scented
with
the
odour
of
flowers
they
sighted
on
the
horizon
a
dark
low
land
above
which
rose
dimly
the
shape
of
a
distant
mountain
the
men
gathered
about
master
and
mate
and
jacob
then
harry
malcolm
went
swarming
up
the
rigging
and
from
the
maintopsail
yard
studied
the
dim
bulk
of
the
mountain
after
a
time
he
cried
down
to
them
douse
all
lights
and
hold
her
on
her
course
for
an
hour
they
stood
toward
the
land
then
malcolm
came
down
from
aloft
smiling
and
there
ran
through
the
ship
a
great
wave
of
talk
though
a
man
had
never
sailed
those
seas
before
he
would
not
have
found
the
reason
for
their
talk
hard
to
guess
since
there
were
few
secrets
on
board
time
and
distance
had
made
less
the
grumbling
occasioned
by
the
disastrous
brush
with
the
porcupine
and
by
the
littleness
of
the
profit
got
from
the
pink
and
they
had
warmed
their
hearts
with
the
old
one
tales
bearing
to
the
west
the
rose
of
devon
skirted
the
dark
shore
for
miles
but
the
master
and
mate
were
growing
anxious
lest
dawn
overtake
them
before
they
should
reach
the
they
sought
and
when
they
rounded
a
certain
wooded
point
and
sailed
into
a
deep
secluded
bay
where
a
ship
might
lie
for
a
year
unseen
which
put
an
end
to
their
fears
they
let
go
their
anchors
with
all
good
will
and
furled
their
sails
and
at
break
of
day
they
kedged
the
ship
into
a
cove
that
might
have
been
a
dock
so
straight
were
the
shores
and
so
deep
the
water
mind
you
ned
or
mind
you
hal
the
night
we
landed
on
hispaniola
the
men
from
the
blue
friggat
were
saying
and
was
thou
at
my
side
when
we
stole
down
through
the
palms
and
bottled
the
garrison
in
the
little
fort
and
ah
what
wine
we
got
that
night
yea
and
how
drunk
we
got
so
that
martin
barwick
was
of
a
mind
to
go
fight
a
duel
with
the
captain
of
the
soldiers
and
then
they
burst
out
and
drove
us
all
away
and
there
was
an
end
of
our
taking
towns
for
a
long
long
while
i
will
have
you
know
that
i
was
no
drunker
than
any
man
else
martin
snarled
and
they
laughed
uproariously
come
cried
another
since
we
have
laid
our
ship
in
her
chosen
berth
let
us
sleep
while
the
idlers
watch
we
shall
be
off
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
nay
in
the
morning
afternoon
or
morning
matters
little
said
old
jacob
thickly
in
the
corner
where
he
sat
watching
all
the
men
the
hour
is
near
when
we
shall
lay
in
the
hold
a
goodly
cargo
i
know
well
town
we
need
only
find
two
more
such
towns
to
get
the
money
to
keep
us
the
rest
of
our
lives
like
so
many
dukes
each
of
us
in
a
great
house
in
england
with
a
park
full
of
deer
and
the
prettiest
tavern
wenches
from
all
the
country
round
to
serve
us
in
the
kitchen
that
day
while
the
men
slept
in
such
cool
places
as
they
could
find
the
cook
and
the
carpenter
stood
watch
and
a
very
good
watch
they
kept
for
they
were
prudent
souls
and
feared
the
old
one
and
dared
not
steal
a
wink
of
sleep
but
though
there
was
much
need
that
the
men
should
sleep
there
was
small
need
of
a
watch
for
the
ship
lay
in
that
deep
cove
in
the
little
round
bay
with
masses
of
palms
on
the
high
banks
which
hid
her
from
waterline
to
truck
at
as
the
old
one
had
bade
them
the
cook
and
the
carpenter
called
the
men
who
came
tumbling
up
quickly
awake
and
breathing
heavily
since
there
was
work
to
be
done
ere
another
morning
broke
and
like
enough
blood
to
be
spilled
from
a
chest
of
arms
harry
malcolm
handed
out
muskets
and
pistols
and
pikes
this
for
you
he
said
and
this
for
you
and
here
a
tall
gun
for
paul
craig
nay
curse
not
prayers
paul
shall
profit
thee
more
than
curses
i
tell
ye
what
i
not
carry
this
great
heavy
gun
quoth
he
and
turned
a
dull
red
from
anger
blubububububub
one
cried
and
all
laughed
is
lucky
paul
retorted
harry
malcolm
that
tom
jordan
is
an
easy
merciful
man
or
there
more
than
one
back
would
bear
a
merry
pattern
in
welts
he
took
up
another
musket
cumbersome
unwieldy
weapons
they
were
which
a
man
must
rest
for
firing
and
handed
it
to
another
and
this
for
you
jacob
was
turning
over
and
over
on
his
palm
powder
from
a
newly
opened
barrel
and
the
old
one
was
leaning
on
the
rail
whence
he
sleepily
watched
the
small
groups
that
were
all
the
time
gathering
and
parting
will
canty
his
face
a
little
whiter
than
ordinary
and
his
hand
holding
his
firelock
upright
by
the
barrel
stood
ill
at
ease
by
the
forecastle
the
boys
lurked
in
corners
keeping
as
much
as
possible
out
of
the
way
but
watching
with
wide
eyes
the
many
preparations
and
indeed
it
was
a
rare
sight
for
the
staunch
old
ship
her
rigging
restored
and
her
many
leaks
stopped
lay
in
her
little
cove
where
a
cool
breeze
stirred
the
ropes
and
the
afternoon
sun
shone
through
the
palms
brightly
on
the
deck
and
the
men
moved
about
and
stripped
to
their
shirts
it
would
save
much
labour
said
the
carpenter
were
we
to
use
this
fair
breeze
to
go
by
sea
true
carpenter
but
a
ship
coming
in
from
sea
is
as
easy
spied
by
night
as
by
day
whereas
a
company
of
men
descending
from
the
hills
by
night
will
have
the
fort
before
the
watchdogs
bark
and
who
is
there
will
grudge
labour
in
such
a
cause
the
old
one
looked
about
and
the
carpenter
himself
nodded
assent
only
paul
craig
grumbled
and
at
him
the
others
laughed
as
they
ate
and
drank
they
slept
again
till
just
before
dawn
then
running
a
plank
to
the
shore
they
gathered
under
the
palms
for
there
was
need
of
a
last
council
before
leaving
the
ship
we
are
forty
men
said
the
old
one
and
forty
men
are
all
too
few
but
though
it
is
little
likely
that
any
will
stumble
on
the
ship
in
our
absence
it
is
a
matter
of
only
common
prudence
that
we
post
a
guard
ere
we
go
yea
a
guard
cried
paul
craig
i
now
am
a
very
watchful
man
nay
but
think
paul
how
great
a
meal
thou
eat
when
thou
hast
climbed
up
hill
and
down
with
thy
gun
and
how
much
thou
drink
be
no
kindness
to
leave
thee
we
must
leave
some
lithe
supple
lad
who
hath
no
need
for
the
tramp
and
the
old
one
chuckled
come
paul
and
martin
you
shall
lead
our
van
harry
malcolm
met
his
eye
and
he
nodded
i
name
to
guard
our
ship
said
he
the
cook
and
joe
kirk
and
will
canty
do
you
lads
load
the
swivel
guns
and
keep
always
at
hand
two
loaded
muskets
apiece
fire
not
unless
the
need
is
urgent
and
keep
the
ship
with
your
lives
for
who
knows
but
the
lives
of
us
all
are
staked
upon
your
watchfulness
and
courage
you
harry
since
you
know
best
the
road
shall
lead
with
paul
and
martin
upon
either
hand
the
rest
shall
follow
and
jacob
and
i
will
guard
the
rear
he
turned
to
the
three
who
were
to
stay
if
there
is
good
news
i
will
send
men
to
bring
the
ship
round
to
the
harbour
where
god
willing
we
shall
load
her
to
the
deck
with
yellow
chinks
if
bad
news
why
you
may
see
us
in
one
day
or
three
or
five
or
maybe
never
he
arched
his
brows
and
tossed
his
piece
to
his
shoulder
and
with
jacob
at
his
side
he
followed
the
others
who
were
already
labouring
under
the
weight
of
their
weapons
as
they
filed
up
the
steep
acclivity
the
old
one
and
jacob
slowly
climbed
the
wild
rough
hill
and
paused
until
the
marching
column
was
out
of
hearing
you
are
a
strange
man
said
jacob
i
would
wring
his
neck
without
thought
that
were
a
mere
brutal
jest
such
as
affordeth
little
joy
the
old
one
replied
i
will
wind
him
in
a
tangle
of
his
own
working
then
i
will
take
the
breath
from
his
nostrils
deliberately
and
he
will
know
when
he
dies
that
i
know
what
i
know
you
are
a
strange
man
i
can
keep
order
among
the
gentlemen
better
than
could
any
captain
in
the
king
service
and
such
a
game
as
this
sharpens
a
man
wits
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
jacob
slipped
away
by
himself
and
the
old
one
followed
his
men
all
that
morning
unseen
and
unsuspected
jacob
sat
behind
a
rock
within
earshot
of
the
ship
the
palms
shielded
him
and
shaded
him
and
he
got
himself
into
such
a
corner
that
no
one
could
approach
him
from
behind
or
see
him
without
being
seen
and
all
that
morning
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
aught
worthy
of
mark
until
about
noon
a
voice
in
the
ship
cried
out
so
that
jacob
could
plainly
understand
the
words
one
should
watch
from
land
now
a
man
on
the
hilltop
could
serve
us
well
to
which
a
second
voice
replied
go
thou
up
will
go
thou
up
we
are
of
no
mind
to
stir
there
came
the
sound
of
steps
on
a
plank
then
a
rattle
of
pebbles
and
a
rustle
of
leaves
and
jacob
rose
quickly
and
followed
at
a
safe
distance
a
man
who
passed
his
corner
on
the
way
up
the
acclivity
reaching
the
summit
of
the
hill
where
he
was
safely
out
of
sight
from
the
ship
the
fellow
and
it
was
indeed
will
canty
searched
the
sea
from
horizon
to
horizon
but
jacob
hunting
deliberately
as
was
his
manner
found
a
seat
a
great
way
off
yet
so
situated
among
the
trees
that
he
could
watch
without
being
seen
for
an
hour
he
sat
thus
in
a
niche
in
the
rocks
below
and
watched
will
on
the
flat
ledge
above
then
he
saw
him
start
up
of
a
sudden
and
look
around
him
very
carefully
and
cautiously
and
whip
his
shirt
off
his
back
and
wave
it
in
the
air
for
a
good
will
waved
the
shirt
stopping
now
and
then
to
rest
but
it
seemed
that
nothing
came
of
his
waving
for
with
a
sad
face
he
put
on
his
shirt
and
again
sat
down
and
presently
he
returned
to
the
ship
jacob
dozed
a
while
longer
where
he
was
having
seen
all
that
for
he
was
a
man
who
could
put
two
and
two
together
as
well
as
another
and
he
had
learned
what
he
wished
to
know
then
he
got
up
and
seeking
out
the
place
where
the
old
one
and
his
men
had
passed
he
followed
after
them
at
a
serious
steady
gait
which
seemed
not
very
fast
yet
which
kept
plodding
so
surely
up
hill
and
down
hill
and
through
gullies
and
over
ledges
and
along
beside
the
sea
that
in
two
hours
he
had
covered
the
distance
the
others
burdened
with
guns
and
pikes
and
swords
had
covered
in
three
and
before
nightfall
following
the
marks
they
had
left
for
him
he
overtook
them
resting
in
a
ravine
night
which
comes
so
suddenly
in
the
tropics
was
about
to
darken
the
world
when
jacob
gave
them
a
great
start
by
walking
silently
in
upon
them
as
they
sat
talking
in
low
voices
with
their
guns
lying
by
their
sides
and
their
minds
on
the
work
that
was
before
them
he
nodded
at
the
old
one
who
knew
well
enough
what
his
nod
meant
and
sat
quietly
down
among
them
there
was
but
a
small
moon
and
when
at
nearly
midnight
they
bestirred
themselves
and
ate
the
last
of
the
sea
bread
they
had
brought
the
light
was
dim
but
their
plans
were
laid
and
the
hour
was
come
and
the
old
one
and
harry
malcolm
and
jacob
knew
the
ways
they
were
to
go
they
were
more
than
thirty
and
they
straggled
out
in
a
long
line
as
they
climbed
the
precipitous
hill
but
those
ahead
waited
at
the
top
for
those
behind
and
together
marching
in
close
array
they
crossed
a
ridge
and
came
into
sight
of
a
little
town
that
lay
below
them
among
hills
and
mountains
it
was
a
dark
and
silent
town
whose
houses
had
a
ghostly
pallor
in
the
faint
light
from
the
crescent
moon
and
it
lay
beside
a
harbour
which
shone
like
silver
there
were
no
lights
in
the
houses
and
in
all
the
place
nothing
stirred
but
in
the
harbour
a
ship
lay
anchored
concerning
which
they
speculated
in
whispers
the
road
lies
yonder
under
the
rock
said
harry
malcolm
and
one
man
has
strayed
jacob
whispered
i
will
fetch
him
he
stepped
back
the
way
they
had
come
and
returned
with
paul
craig
who
dragged
his
gun
by
the
muzzle
the
fellow
manner
betrayed
his
cowardice
and
the
old
one
pushed
the
point
of
a
knife
against
his
breast
if
again
you
stray
or
loiter
he
whispered
this
blade
will
rip
you
open
like
a
hog
fat
for
the
killing
though
the
words
were
uttered
very
softly
others
heard
them
and
martin
barwick
whose
courage
was
none
of
the
staunchest
rubbed
his
throat
and
swallowed
hard
gold
without
stint
is
ours
for
the
taking
said
the
old
one
i
have
a
misliking
of
yonder
ship
nay
she
is
but
one
more
prize
they
moved
down
the
mountain
path
toward
the
town
there
are
twelve
houses
said
jacob
two
men
to
a
house
leaves
ten
for
the
fort
in
the
dim
light
he
had
missed
his
count
for
the
men
as
they
approached
the
gate
of
the
village
had
crowded
together
no
one
sleeps
in
the
fort
quoth
harry
malcolm
in
a
low
voice
they
go
to
the
fort
only
when
they
are
attacked
by
dogs
of
english
or
wicked
pirates
some
one
laughed
softly
two
men
to
a
house
the
old
one
was
saying
kill
plunder
and
burn
then
as
they
stood
in
the
very
gate
a
dog
barked
they
jumped
at
the
sound
but
higher
by
far
did
they
jump
when
from
the
ship
lying
in
the
harbour
there
came
a
loud
hail
in
spanish
ha
the
dogs
are
wakeful
the
old
one
cried
in
double
meaning
and
with
that
he
plunged
forward
through
the
shadows
though
for
the
most
part
he
showed
himself
a
shrewd
cautious
man
he
was
not
one
to
turn
back
when
his
blood
was
up
and
quicker
than
thought
he
had
raised
his
voice
to
a
yell
come
my
hearts
and
burn
them
in
their
beds
nay
nay
cried
jacob
come
back
while
there
is
yet
time
they
can
not
yet
know
who
we
are
or
from
whence
we
come
another
day
another
month
will
be
best
but
they
had
gone
with
a
yell
the
old
one
had
led
the
way
and
they
had
followed
at
his
heels
jacob
was
left
alone
in
the
dark
and
being
a
rarely
prudent
man
and
of
no
mind
to
risk
his
neck
lightly
he
stayed
where
he
was
as
the
old
one
stormed
the
first
house
there
came
a
shot
from
the
darkness
and
he
gave
a
howl
of
pain
and
rage
turning
phil
marsham
saw
a
stranger
cross
the
road
behind
him
but
he
had
no
time
to
consider
the
matter
since
the
first
cries
had
waked
the
town
a
dozen
men
were
exchanging
with
the
fort
wherein
they
were
for
their
shots
went
wild
in
the
dark
and
their
guns
took
a
long
time
loading
and
the
old
one
thinking
to
further
the
attack
and
not
considering
that
the
light
would
reveal
their
whereabouts
and
their
weakness
struck
fire
to
dry
grass
which
blazed
up
and
caught
wood
but
went
out
hissing
under
a
bucket
of
water
from
within
a
house
here
a
man
took
the
steel
and
died
and
there
another
went
down
hit
by
a
in
a
lull
in
the
firing
for
the
charges
of
their
guns
were
soon
spent
they
heard
plainly
the
sound
of
oars
and
saw
that
two
boats
were
bringing
men
from
the
vessel
in
the
harbour
and
from
the
far
side
of
the
place
others
came
charging
with
pikes
and
swords
in
all
truth
the
town
was
aroused
and
the
game
was
over
so
they
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
for
their
lives
since
they
were
outnumbered
and
outfought
and
no
other
course
was
left
them
all
who
escaped
gathered
on
the
hill
for
though
a
man
might
wish
in
his
heart
to
leave
the
rose
of
devon
for
ever
he
could
find
no
refuge
in
the
nest
of
hornets
they
had
stirred
to
fury
since
in
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
one
must
appear
as
guilty
as
another
so
leaving
ten
of
their
number
behind
them
dead
or
wounded
or
captured
every
man
who
could
walk
started
back
for
the
rose
of
devon
with
the
thought
to
cheer
him
on
that
after
daybreak
in
all
likelihood
the
howling
pack
would
be
at
his
heels
they
bickered
and
wrangled
and
cursed
and
one
whispered
to
philip
marsham
that
if
they
had
an
abler
captain
their
luck
would
turn
which
was
a
great
folly
and
cost
him
a
broken
head
that
for
thy
prattle
the
old
one
cried
for
he
had
been
walking
just
behind
and
with
a
club
he
struck
the
fellow
a
blow
that
sent
him
to
the
ground
indeed
the
old
one
had
intended
to
kill
him
and
had
he
not
been
so
weary
he
would
doubtless
have
stayed
to
complete
his
work
for
his
temper
was
torn
to
rags
uphill
and
down
they
went
through
thickets
and
streams
over
ledges
and
sandy
slides
round
dank
old
fallen
logs
and
along
firm
beaches
back
to
their
dark
frigate
with
their
labour
for
their
pains
and
so
by
broad
daylight
weary
and
hungry
and
too
angry
for
civil
speech
they
came
to
the
rose
of
devon
the
younkers
trotted
along
and
the
men
tramped
in
as
best
they
could
there
were
hard
words
on
this
side
and
hard
words
on
that
and
hands
were
clapped
on
knives
for
no
cause
at
all
they
thought
it
queer
when
in
the
gray
morning
they
came
sliding
down
to
the
ship
with
a
rattle
of
pebbles
and
loose
earth
that
they
found
her
so
still
and
only
the
cook
on
her
deck
and
himself
in
a
cold
sweat
of
fear
i
would
have
nought
to
do
with
it
he
cried
and
being
still
mindful
of
his
thirsty
hours
in
bilboes
he
shook
in
his
shoes
lest
they
fix
upon
him
a
share
of
the
blame
for
that
which
had
occurred
in
their
absence
with
what
and
whom
thou
have
nought
to
do
the
old
one
demanded
and
he
showed
a
face
that
made
the
cook
teeth
rattle
with
them
they
gone
who
hath
gone
will
canty
and
joe
kirk
they
took
the
shallop
and
bread
and
beer
it
seems
said
the
old
one
and
in
a
strangely
quiet
voice
that
the
edge
that
is
nicked
is
not
will
canty
is
it
thine
jacob
or
mine
the
cook
thought
that
either
he
or
the
old
one
had
lost
his
wits
for
he
made
no
sense
of
the
words
but
harry
malcolm
and
jacob
knew
what
was
meant
and
philip
marsham
made
a
sharp
guess
at
it
chapter
xvi
the
harbour
of
refuge
it
was
up
anchor
and
away
for
they
needs
must
flee
ere
the
hunters
find
them
they
stood
along
the
coast
with
a
light
breeze
in
the
early
morning
when
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
sea
and
tipping
with
gold
the
branches
of
the
dark
palms
but
the
rose
of
devon
was
a
hawk
with
clipped
wings
a
company
of
or
thirty
men
in
a
staunch
ship
with
a
goodly
number
of
brass
cannon
and
with
powder
and
balls
in
abundance
which
provident
merchants
had
bought
to
defend
their
venture
against
pirates
might
have
done
very
well
on
a
merchant
voyage
or
fishing
if
there
are
not
too
many
to
share
in
the
adventure
a
man
can
earn
his
wages
by
the
one
or
if
he
would
go
to
the
banks
of
newfoundland
or
to
massachusetts
bay
his
lay
of
a
fishing
voyage
will
doubtless
bring
him
enough
golden
chinks
to
drink
in
strong
ale
or
sack
the
health
of
every
fair
maiden
of
plymouth
ere
he
must
be
off
to
fill
his
pockets
anew
though
the
times
be
ever
so
hard
he
is
a
feckless
sailor
who
can
not
earn
in
such
a
company
the
price
of
drinking
the
three
outs
but
to
work
a
ship
and
lay
aboard
a
rich
prize
with
perhaps
need
to
show
heels
to
a
king
cruiser
or
to
fight
her
is
quite
another
game
and
the
old
one
and
harry
malcolm
who
had
their
full
share
of
the
that
prevailed
throughout
the
ship
cursed
their
fortune
each
in
his
own
way
and
wrangled
together
and
quarrelled
with
the
men
and
indeed
among
all
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
there
were
only
two
or
three
who
that
morning
remained
unperturbed
by
their
misadventures
of
the
night
one
was
jacob
who
sat
in
this
corner
or
that
and
eyed
all
comers
coldly
and
as
if
from
a
distance
a
second
was
philip
marsham
who
did
not
like
jacob
appear
to
lose
his
warmer
interest
in
the
ship
and
her
company
but
whose
interest
had
been
always
less
as
for
himself
alone
meeting
in
groups
of
three
or
five
the
men
ripped
out
oaths
and
told
of
how
one
captain
or
another
had
once
taken
a
ship
or
a
town
with
vast
bloodshed
and
plunder
and
thus
they
stormed
about
the
deck
at
intervals
until
an
hour
after
sunrise
when
phil
from
the
forecastle
and
old
jacob
from
his
corner
under
the
having
observed
them
for
some
time
putting
their
heads
together
and
conversing
in
undertones
heard
them
crying
out
yea
yea
go
on
go
on
we
are
all
with
you
four
of
the
men
then
started
through
the
steerage
room
to
the
great
cabin
and
the
rest
gathered
in
a
sullen
half
circle
just
under
the
jacob
raised
his
head
and
listened
his
face
was
very
thoughtful
and
his
small
mouth
was
puckered
tight
at
the
sounds
that
issued
from
the
cabin
phil
himself
drew
nearer
well
cried
the
old
one
in
a
voice
that
seemed
as
full
of
wonder
as
of
wrath
they
heard
him
plainly
what
in
the
devil
name
mean
ye
by
this
we
ha
lost
a
dozen
men
and
our
shallop
by
this
foolish
march
and
from
this
rich
town
of
which
you
have
promised
much
we
have
got
only
blows
and
balls
for
our
labour
the
speaker
voice
was
loud
and
harsh
and
he
larded
his
speech
with
such
oaths
and
obscene
bywords
as
are
not
fit
for
printing
we
are
of
a
mind
to
change
captains
you
shall
go
forward
and
paul
craig
shall
come
aft
speak
up
paul
tell
your
tale
of
no
marching
to
wear
out
a
man
feet
there
came
a
string
of
oaths
in
the
old
one
voice
and
a
wild
stamping
and
crashing
then
out
they
burst
jostling
one
another
in
their
haste
and
after
them
the
old
one
with
a
clubbed
musket
he
subdued
his
fury
when
he
faced
the
ring
of
sullen
men
as
if
he
had
taken
it
with
his
hands
and
pushed
it
down
but
they
feared
him
none
the
less
and
perhaps
the
more
a
man
looking
at
him
must
perceive
that
his
mind
was
keen
and
subtle
which
made
his
quietness
when
he
was
angry
more
terrible
than
a
great
show
of
wrath
i
have
sailed
before
with
mad
fickle
crews
said
he
yea
once
with
a
crew
so
mad
that
it
would
send
a
gentleman
post
unto
the
king
with
a
petition
of
grievances
because
a
king
ship
had
chased
us
from
the
south
foreland
to
the
lizard
but
never
saw
i
a
more
mad
crew
than
this
which
is
enough
to
give
a
man
a
grievous
affliction
of
the
colic
and
stone
by
the
very
excess
of
its
madness
as
for
madness
cried
a
man
who
stood
at
a
safe
distance
behind
the
rest
i
charge
thee
with
worse
than
madness
we
have
lost
two
fights
and
many
men
and
have
got
to
show
for
it
a
kettle
of
fish
some
laughed
but
more
muttered
angrily
why
we
have
had
our
ill
fortunes
but
what
gentlemen
of
the
sea
have
not
come
make
an
end
of
this
talk
come
out
you
who
spoke
and
let
us
consider
the
matter
nay
he
will
not
come
though
by
his
speech
he
is
a
bold
man
again
some
of
them
laughed
but
in
a
mean
way
for
he
had
cowed
them
by
his
show
of
violence
and
they
feared
more
than
ever
that
subtle
spirit
which
their
understanding
listen
then
my
hearts
of
gold
we
will
come
about
and
sail
back
we
will
lie
tonight
by
the
very
town
that
last
night
we
stormed
we
will
seek
it
out
as
a
harbour
of
refuge
we
will
tell
them
a
tale
of
meeting
pirates
who
captured
our
shallop
and
part
of
our
men
we
will
give
them
such
a
story
that
they
will
think
we
have
met
the
very
men
they
themselves
last
night
beat
off
and
will
welcome
us
with
open
arms
to
succour
our
distress
who
knows
but
that
we
can
then
take
them
by
assault
or
if
for
the
time
they
are
too
strong
for
us
we
will
mark
well
the
approaches
and
the
defenses
and
some
night
we
will
again
come
back
the
idea
caught
their
fancy
and
though
a
few
cried
nay
and
whispered
that
it
was
the
sheerest
madness
yet
more
cried
yea
and
argued
there
was
little
risk
for
if
worst
should
come
to
worst
they
could
turn
tail
and
run
as
run
they
had
before
as
they
talked
they
forgot
their
many
woes
and
whispered
about
that
none
but
the
old
one
would
ever
think
of
such
a
scheme
harry
malcolm
and
the
old
one
went
off
by
themselves
and
put
their
heads
together
and
conversed
secretly
and
throughout
the
ship
there
was
a
great
buzz
of
voices
only
jacob
who
sat
in
his
corner
and
watched
now
one
and
now
another
and
philip
marsham
who
watched
jacob
kept
silence
amidst
the
so
they
wore
ship
and
returning
along
the
shores
came
again
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
into
sight
of
the
flat
mountain
they
had
seen
first
by
night
and
though
the
wind
fell
away
at
times
until
the
sails
hung
in
listless
folds
they
gathered
speed
with
the
evening
breeze
and
came
at
nightfall
into
a
fine
landlocked
harbour
with
the
town
at
its
head
where
there
were
lights
shining
from
the
houses
and
a
ship
still
lying
at
anchor
upon
their
coming
there
was
a
great
stir
in
the
town
they
saw
lights
moving
and
heard
across
the
water
voices
calling
but
though
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
stood
by
their
guns
ready
to
lift
the
ports
at
a
word
and
run
out
their
pieces
they
laughed
in
their
sleeves
at
their
own
audacity
whereby
they
hoped
greatly
to
enrich
their
coffers
then
one
in
the
fort
hailed
them
in
spanish
and
while
the
old
one
made
answer
in
the
same
tongue
those
who
understood
it
whispered
to
the
rest
that
he
was
giving
the
men
in
the
fort
a
sad
tale
of
how
the
rose
of
devon
had
fallen
in
with
a
band
of
sailors
of
fortune
who
had
killed
part
of
her
men
and
would
have
killed
them
all
had
not
the
old
one
himself
by
a
bold
and
clever
stroke
eluded
them
the
old
one
and
the
man
in
the
fort
flung
questions
and
answers
back
and
forth
and
as
they
talked
the
men
at
the
guns
relaxed
and
softly
laughed
and
martin
whispered
to
philip
marsham
yea
they
are
telling
of
a
band
of
roving
englishmen
who
last
night
singed
their
very
whiskers
and
being
clever
men
and
learning
that
them
whom
we
ourselves
have
met
and
fought
were
lawless
english
dogs
they
perceive
we
needs
have
met
the
very
rascals
that
made
them
so
much
trouble
again
martin
listened
then
slapped
his
thigh
they
are
sending
us
boats
he
exclaimed
though
they
perceive
we
are
english
it
seemeth
they
bear
an
englishman
no
ill
will
because
he
is
english
truly
a
fool
shall
be
known
by
his
folly
most
of
the
men
were
elated
but
old
jacob
watched
and
said
nought
his
black
bright
eyes
and
his
nose
which
came
out
in
a
broad
curve
made
him
look
like
an
old
wise
rat
as
the
boats
came
over
the
dark
water
with
the
soft
splash
of
oars
there
was
hurried
talking
on
the
then
the
old
one
came
swiftly
good
boatswain
said
he
these
foolish
fellows
have
bade
us
ashore
to
break
bread
with
them
and
share
a
bottle
of
wine
now
i
am
of
a
mind
to
go
and
harry
malcolm
is
of
a
mind
to
bear
me
company
we
will
take
twelve
men
and
so
arrange
it
that
they
shall
not
surprise
us
yea
i
am
too
old
a
dog
to
be
caught
by
tricks
it
may
be
we
can
strike
them
again
tonight
and
a
telling
blow
it
may
be
not
but
do
you
and
jacob
keep
watch
on
board
with
every
man
at
his
station
in
case
of
need
so
the
rose
of
devon
let
go
her
anchors
and
swung
with
the
tide
a
cable
length
from
the
unknown
ship
which
lay
dark
and
silent
and
apparently
deserted
the
strange
boats
came
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
poop
and
the
old
one
and
harry
with
their
men
mustered
about
them
exchanged
greetings
with
the
oarsmen
below
in
rough
english
and
in
rougher
spanish
as
each
side
strove
to
outdo
the
other
in
civility
the
men
heavily
armed
slid
down
into
the
boats
and
the
old
one
smiled
as
he
watched
them
go
for
he
was
himself
well
pleased
with
the
escapade
such
harebrained
adventures
were
his
bread
of
life
he
followed
the
men
the
cabin
lanthorn
in
his
hand
and
after
him
came
harry
malcolm
as
cool
as
a
man
could
desire
and
watched
very
sharply
all
that
went
on
while
the
boats
rowed
slowly
away
toward
the
land
then
jacob
came
out
of
his
corner
and
spoke
to
phil
i
will
watch
first
said
he
the
cook
hath
laid
a
fine
supper
on
the
cabin
table
go
you
down
and
eat
your
fill
then
come
up
and
keep
the
deck
and
i
will
go
down
and
eat
in
my
turn
at
something
in
the
man
manner
which
puzzled
him
phil
hesitated
but
the
thought
was
friendly
and
he
said
i
will
not
be
long
do
not
hurry
when
phil
turned
away
old
jacob
cleared
his
throat
boatswain
yea
do
not
hurry
as
phil
sat
at
the
table
in
the
great
cabin
which
was
so
dark
that
he
could
scarcely
see
the
plate
in
front
of
him
although
he
ate
with
no
less
eagerness
because
of
the
darkness
the
planks
and
timbers
and
transoms
and
benches
were
merged
into
an
indiscriminate
background
of
and
there
hung
before
him
by
chance
a
mirror
on
the
forward
bulkhead
in
which
the
reflection
of
the
yellow
sky
threw
into
sharp
outline
the
gallery
door
at
his
back
having
no
means
at
hand
for
striking
a
light
he
was
hungrily
eating
and
paying
little
heed
to
his
surroundings
when
in
the
mirror
before
his
eyes
against
the
yellow
western
sky
the
silhouette
of
a
head
wearing
a
sweeping
hat
appeared
over
the
gallery
rail
there
was
not
the
faintest
noise
and
no
slightest
motion
of
the
ship
was
perceptible
in
the
brown
stillness
of
the
evening
the
head
darkly
silhouetted
appeared
in
the
mirror
as
if
it
were
a
thing
not
of
this
earth
and
immediately
for
he
was
one
who
always
kept
his
wits
about
him
phil
slipped
silently
off
the
bench
and
letting
himself
down
flat
on
the
deck
slid
back
into
the
darkest
corner
of
all
which
lay
to
the
starboard
of
the
gallery
door
there
without
a
sound
he
rose
to
his
feet
the
black
silhouette
reflected
in
the
mirror
grew
larger
until
it
nearly
blocked
the
reflection
of
the
door
then
a
board
in
the
gallery
gently
creaked
and
phil
knew
that
the
man
whoever
he
was
was
coming
into
the
cabin
presently
in
the
subdued
light
he
could
dimly
see
the
man
himself
who
stood
by
the
table
with
his
back
toward
phil
and
glanced
about
the
cabin
from
one
side
to
the
other
knowing
only
that
he
was
a
stranger
and
therefore
had
no
right
to
enter
the
great
cabin
of
the
rose
of
devon
phil
had
it
in
mind
to
jump
and
seize
him
from
behind
for
so
far
as
he
could
appraise
the
man
figure
the
two
were
a
fair
match
in
weight
and
height
but
when
phil
was
gathering
himself
for
the
leap
he
saw
in
the
mirror
the
reflection
of
a
second
head
and
then
of
a
third
again
the
gallery
creaked
for
the
newcomers
like
the
first
were
on
their
way
into
the
cabin
by
the
door
they
stood
for
a
moment
listening
and
in
the
silence
phil
heard
a
boat
gently
bumping
against
the
side
of
the
ship
he
was
first
of
a
mind
naturally
to
cry
an
alarm
but
were
he
to
call
for
help
he
would
learn
no
more
of
their
errand
they
drew
together
beside
the
table
and
conversed
in
whispers
of
which
phil
could
distinguish
nothing
although
he
was
near
enough
to
reach
out
his
hand
and
seize
hold
of
the
curls
and
brave
hat
of
the
nearest
of
them
to
attack
them
were
an
act
of
plain
folly
for
they
wore
swords
and
doubtless
other
weapons
but
when
he
perceived
that
the
first
had
got
out
flint
and
steel
he
knew
that
they
must
soon
discover
him
whence
and
for
what
have
you
come
he
said
in
a
low
voice
they
turned
quickly
but
with
admirable
composure
there
were
never
seen
three
calmer
men
the
first
struck
light
to
a
slow
match
and
held
over
it
the
wick
of
a
candle
drawn
from
his
pocket
upon
which
the
flame
took
hold
and
blazed
up
throwing
curious
shadows
into
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
half
revealing
the
hangings
and
weapons
the
man
raised
the
candle
and
the
three
drew
close
about
phil
and
looked
at
him
steadily
so
a
watch
is
set
in
the
cabin
i
perceive
the
man
holding
the
candle
said
with
a
quiet
ironical
smile
by
mien
and
speech
phil
knew
upon
the
instant
that
they
were
englishmen
and
it
took
no
great
discernment
to
see
that
they
were
gentlemen
and
men
of
authority
they
pressed
closer
about
him
whence
and
for
what
have
you
come
he
repeated
they
made
no
reply
but
stood
in
the
brown
light
holding
high
their
candle
and
looking
him
hard
in
the
face
again
he
heard
the
boat
bumping
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
now
the
murmur
of
the
wind
aloft
far
away
he
heard
a
faint
sound
of
calling
which
was
growing
constantly
louder
the
three
exchanged
glances
and
whispering
to
one
another
moved
toward
the
gallery
but
as
they
started
to
go
the
one
turned
back
and
held
the
candle
to
face
of
this
be
assured
my
fine
fellow
said
he
i
shall
know
you
well
if
ever
i
see
you
again
phil
was
of
a
mind
to
call
after
them
to
pursue
them
to
flee
with
them
but
as
it
is
easy
to
understand
there
were
strong
reasons
for
his
staying
where
he
was
and
there
had
been
little
welcome
in
their
faces
he
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
table
and
noticed
that
the
sky
in
the
mirror
had
turned
from
a
clear
olive
to
a
deep
gray
and
that
the
lines
of
the
door
and
the
gallery
rail
had
lost
their
sharp
decisiveness
and
had
blurred
into
the
dark
background
then
he
darted
out
of
the
cabin
through
the
steerage
and
called
sharply
jacob
jacob
the
men
watching
at
the
guns
stirred
in
suppressed
excitement
and
turned
from
whispering
uneasily
there
are
strange
sounds
yonder
boatswain
called
one
and
shall
we
knock
out
the
ports
and
loose
the
tacklings
another
asked
be
still
jacob
jacob
phil
cried
running
up
on
the
there
was
no
one
on
the
there
was
no
one
on
the
poop
the
wind
was
blowing
up
into
a
fair
breeze
and
small
waves
were
licking
against
the
dark
sides
of
the
rose
of
devon
but
the
after
decks
were
deserted
jacob
phil
cried
once
more
and
sent
his
voice
out
far
across
the
water
but
there
was
still
no
answer
jacob
had
gone
for
a
moment
the
lad
stood
by
the
rail
and
intently
listened
the
calling
on
shore
had
ceased
but
a
boat
was
rowing
out
from
the
town
and
the
beat
of
oars
was
quick
and
irregular
further
to
swell
his
anxiety
there
was
a
great
bustle
on
board
the
unknown
ship
which
had
been
lying
hitherto
with
no
sign
of
human
life
then
philip
marsham
took
the
fate
of
the
rose
of
devon
in
his
hands
and
leaned
out
over
the
gun
holla
there
he
called
but
not
loudly
let
the
younkers
lay
quietly
aloft
and
lie
ready
on
the
yards
to
let
the
sails
fall
at
a
word
seeming
encouraged
and
reassured
by
a
summons
to
action
the
younger
men
went
swarming
up
the
rigging
and
as
quietly
as
one
could
wish
but
even
the
low
sound
of
their
subdued
voices
drummed
loud
in
the
ears
of
the
lad
on
the
jacob
had
gone
the
boatswain
for
one
remembered
old
tales
of
rats
leaving
ships
of
ill
fortune
chapter
xvii
will
canty
they
saw
a
boat
coming
a
long
way
off
with
her
men
rowing
furiously
but
by
that
time
there
were
all
manner
of
sounds
on
the
shore
whence
the
boat
had
launched
forth
shouts
and
yells
in
english
and
spanish
with
ever
the
booming
of
guns
echoed
across
the
harbour
beacons
flamed
up
and
for
a
while
danced
fitfully
only
to
die
away
when
those
who
tended
the
fires
left
them
unwatched
and
with
flaming
brands
joined
in
the
cry
and
in
the
wake
of
the
furiously
rowing
boat
came
others
that
strove
with
a
great
thresh
of
oars
to
overhaul
the
fugitive
the
activity
and
tumult
were
very
small
and
faint
under
the
bright
stars
in
that
harbour
girdled
about
with
palms
though
the
rugged
slopes
of
wild
mountains
rising
like
escarpments
above
the
harbour
by
day
completely
dwarfed
it
yet
the
stars
made
the
mountains
seem
by
night
mere
pigmy
hills
and
even
the
many
sounds
which
a
great
echoing
redoubled
seemed
smaller
and
fainter
in
the
presence
of
the
vast
spaces
that
such
a
night
suggests
although
the
men
in
the
foremost
boat
rowed
out
of
time
and
clumsily
their
fierce
efforts
kept
them
their
lead
and
they
were
still
far
in
advance
of
their
pursuers
when
they
tossed
up
their
oars
and
crouched
panting
on
the
thwarts
in
the
shadow
of
the
ship
ropes
you
fools
the
old
one
called
cast
us
ropes
ropes
bind
fast
this
bird
we
caught
and
trice
him
up
now
my
hearts
swing
him
aloft
there
he
swings
and
up
he
goes
well
done
i
keep
him
though
i
risk
my
neck
in
doing
it
make
fast
a
rope
at
bow
and
at
stern
good
every
man
for
himself
up
thou
and
thou
up
go
we
all
come
tally
on
and
hoist
the
boat
on
board
and
the
men
are
aloft
well
done
jacob
haul
up
the
anchor
and
let
fall
the
courses
it
was
plain
from
their
manner
that
those
who
came
swarming
up
the
sides
had
a
story
to
tell
but
there
was
little
time
then
for
the
pursuing
boats
lifted
their
oars
and
swung
at
a
distance
with
the
tide
since
it
was
plain
for
all
to
see
that
they
were
too
late
to
overhaul
the
fugitives
although
on
board
the
stranger
ship
there
were
signs
and
sounds
of
warlike
activity
she
too
refrained
from
aggression
and
the
old
one
having
no
mind
to
traffic
with
them
further
paced
the
deck
with
a
rumble
of
oaths
and
drove
the
men
alow
and
aloft
to
make
sail
and
be
gone
it
was
haul
you
swine
and
heave
you
drunken
dogs
and
slacken
off
the
weather
braces
leap
for
your
lives
and
haul
there
haul
a
touch
of
the
rope
end
boatswain
to
stir
their
spirits
and
come
clear
the
main
topsail
up
aloft
to
the
topsail
yard
young
men
a
knife
you
dog
a
knife
slash
the
gaskets
clear
a
touch
of
the
helm
there
harder
harder
there
she
holds
steady
then
harry
malcolm
called
from
the
in
his
quiet
quick
voice
the
swivel
gun
is
loaden
tom
i
chance
a
shot
upon
the
advantage
good
say
i
quoth
the
old
one
and
if
the
first
shot
prove
ill
amend
it
with
a
second
they
saw
moving
on
the
forecastle
the
light
of
a
match
and
after
such
brief
space
of
time
as
a
spark
takes
to
go
from
to
touchhole
the
gun
which
was
charged
with
small
shot
for
sweeping
the
deck
if
an
enemy
should
board
the
ship
showered
the
distant
boats
with
metal
they
saw
by
the
splashing
that
the
charge
had
carried
well
and
that
malcolm
aim
was
true
and
a
yell
and
a
volley
of
curses
told
them
as
well
as
did
the
splash
which
was
dimly
seen
by
starlight
that
the
shot
had
scored
a
hit
while
a
sailor
sponged
the
gun
harry
malcolm
gave
a
shog
to
the
full
ladle
of
powder
and
keeping
his
body
clear
of
the
muzzle
put
the
ladle
home
to
the
chamber
where
he
turned
it
till
his
thumb
on
the
was
down
and
gave
it
a
shake
to
clear
out
the
powder
and
haled
it
forth
again
then
with
the
rammer
he
put
the
powder
home
and
drove
after
it
a
good
wad
and
in
anger
and
haste
called
for
a
shot
then
the
old
one
laughed
through
his
teeth
go
thou
down
jacob
cried
he
and
give
them
a
ball
from
the
stern
chaser
to
sink
one
of
those
water
snakes
now
would
be
a
message
worthy
of
our
parting
jacob
jacob
i
say
there
was
no
answer
from
old
jacob
it
was
boatswain
marsham
who
cried
back
he
hath
gone
gone
quoth
the
old
one
his
face
as
the
starlight
revealed
it
was
not
for
the
reading
but
despite
him
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
caught
the
attention
of
the
men
gone
the
old
one
repeated
and
leaned
down
in
the
darkness
the
shadows
quite
concealed
his
face
when
he
was
bent
over
so
far
that
no
light
from
above
could
fall
on
it
but
he
raised
his
hand
and
beckoned
to
the
boatswain
in
a
way
there
was
no
mistaking
in
response
to
the
summons
of
the
long
forefinger
phil
climbed
the
ladder
to
his
side
you
say
he
hath
gone
the
old
one
quietly
repeated
when
did
he
go
i
do
not
know
he
kept
the
deck
when
i
went
below
for
supper
how
did
he
go
nor
do
i
know
that
but
three
men
came
into
the
cabin
by
way
of
the
gallery
while
i
was
there
three
men
say
you
speak
on
the
old
one
leaned
back
and
folded
his
arms
and
though
he
smiled
he
listened
very
carefully
to
the
story
the
boatswain
told
and
when
you
came
on
deck
he
was
gone
the
old
one
tapped
the
rail
you
have
booklearning
can
you
navigate
a
ship
i
can
yea
it
may
well
be
that
now
we
shall
have
need
of
such
learning
it
was
an
odd
day
when
you
and
i
met
beside
the
road
i
shall
not
soon
forget
that
ranting
fool
with
the
book
who
was
as
good
as
a
to
while
away
an
afternoon
when
time
hung
heavy
oft
we
left
him
fallen
at
the
crest
in
the
old
days
when
he
dwelt
in
bideford
but
jacob
saw
no
sport
in
it
nor
could
he
abide
the
fellow
the
old
one
looked
phil
frankly
in
the
eye
and
smiled
in
faith
i
had
a
rare
game
that
day
with
martin
whose
wits
are
but
a
slubbering
matter
at
best
but
that
all
done
and
away
with
and
jacob
hath
gone
let
him
go
betide
it
what
may
there
is
one
score
i
shall
settle
before
my
hour
comes
go
forward
boatswain
and
bear
a
sharp
watch
at
sea
and
mind
you
come
not
abaft
the
mainmast
until
i
give
you
leave
the
old
one
spoke
again
when
phil
was
on
the
ladder
mind
you
boatswain
come
not
abaft
the
mainmast
until
i
give
you
leave
i
bear
you
nought
but
love
but
i
will
have
you
know
that
in
what
i
have
to
do
i
will
brook
no
interruption
though
tom
jordan
had
spoken
him
kindly
the
lad
was
not
so
blunt
of
wit
that
he
failed
to
detect
suspicion
in
the
man
manner
he
stopped
by
the
forecastle
and
looking
back
saw
that
the
old
one
was
giving
the
helmsman
orders
for
the
ship
had
cleared
the
harbour
to
all
appearances
unpursued
and
was
again
bearing
up
the
coast
the
old
one
then
came
down
from
the
and
having
spoken
to
several
of
the
men
in
turn
called
come
martin
come
paul
bring
the
fellow
in
and
with
that
he
went
into
the
great
cabin
where
they
heard
him
speaking
to
harry
malcolm
as
for
martin
barwick
and
paul
craig
they
went
over
to
where
the
one
had
all
this
time
been
lying
whom
they
had
trussed
up
in
ropes
and
hoisted
on
board
all
the
time
he
had
been
in
the
ship
he
had
neither
moved
nor
spoken
nor
did
he
speak
now
as
they
picked
him
up
one
at
his
head
and
one
at
his
feet
and
carried
him
into
the
cabin
the
door
shut
and
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
there
were
some
to
whom
the
matter
was
a
mystery
and
the
boatswain
was
among
them
but
the
whispering
and
nodding
showed
that
more
knew
the
secret
than
were
ignorant
of
it
the
ship
thrust
her
nose
into
a
heavy
swell
and
pitched
until
her
yards
knocked
on
the
masts
the
breeze
blew
up
and
whipped
the
tops
off
the
waves
and
showered
the
decks
with
spray
the
sky
darkened
with
clouds
and
threatened
rain
but
in
the
ship
there
was
such
a
deep
silence
as
stifles
a
man
which
endured
and
seemed
were
it
possible
to
grow
minute
by
minute
more
intense
until
a
low
cry
burst
from
the
cabin
the
men
sitting
here
and
there
on
deck
stirred
and
looked
at
one
another
but
philip
marsham
leaped
to
his
feet
sit
down
lad
said
the
carpenter
drop
your
hand
nay
it
is
better
that
i
keep
my
hand
on
your
arm
drop
your
hand
hinder
me
not
nay
i
am
obeying
orders
there
came
a
second
cry
from
the
cabin
and
phil
laid
his
free
hand
on
his
dirk
have
care
boatswain
lest
thy
folly
cost
thee
dear
there
are
others
set
to
watch
the
deck
as
well
as
i
and
now
three
men
who
had
been
sitting
by
the
mainmast
rose
they
were
looking
toward
phil
and
the
carpenter
and
one
of
them
slowly
walked
thither
though
philip
marsham
had
no
fear
of
hard
fighting
neither
was
he
an
arrant
fool
and
instantly
he
perceived
that
he
was
one
man
against
many
under
circumstances
that
doubled
the
odds
his
heart
beat
fast
and
a
cold
sweat
sprang
out
on
his
forehead
what
are
they
doing
to
him
he
demanded
nothing
that
he
hath
not
richly
earned
said
the
man
who
had
come
near
the
two
scarcely
conscious
of
his
own
thought
phil
glanced
toward
the
dark
and
distant
shore
but
slight
though
his
motion
the
carpenter
one
eye
saw
it
and
his
none
too
nimble
wit
understood
it
nay
said
he
it
is
a
mad
conceit
the
carpenter
thrust
his
fingers
through
his
beard
and
being
a
kindly
soul
in
his
own
way
and
having
a
liking
for
the
boatswain
he
wished
himself
rid
of
his
responsibilities
but
since
there
was
no
escape
from
the
situation
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
squared
his
shoulders
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
heard
of
a
man
once
when
i
was
a
little
lad
he
said
who
was
cast
ashore
on
the
main
in
mexico
or
some
such
place
miles
philips
was
his
name
and
the
manner
of
his
suffering
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
and
the
spaniards
may
serve
as
a
warning
for
they
flung
him
into
prison
where
he
was
like
to
have
starved
and
they
tortured
him
in
the
inquisition
where
he
was
like
to
have
perished
miserably
and
many
of
his
companions
they
beat
and
killed
or
sent
to
the
galleys
and
himself
and
certain
others
they
sold
for
slaves
so
grievous
was
his
suffering
he
was
nigh
death
when
he
heard
news
of
sir
francis
drake
being
in
those
seas
and
ran
away
to
join
him
yet
again
they
caught
him
caught
this
miles
philips
and
clapped
him
into
prison
with
a
great
pair
of
bolts
on
his
legs
and
yet
once
more
did
he
escape
for
god
willed
it
and
filed
off
his
irons
and
got
him
away
and
so
betook
him
back
to
england
after
such
further
suffering
from
the
indians
and
the
mosquitoes
and
the
spaniards
and
the
dogs
of
the
inquisition
as
few
men
have
lived
to
tell
the
tale
of
all
this
i
have
heard
from
an
old
man
who
knew
him
is
told
in
master
hakluyt
book
where
any
scholar
of
reading
may
find
it
for
himself
though
not
a
man
of
reading
yet
have
i
taken
it
to
heart
to
beware
of
straying
from
a
ship
into
a
strange
land
of
all
the
fellow
had
said
philip
marsham
had
heard
no
more
than
half
for
the
cry
that
had
twice
sounded
still
rang
in
his
ears
although
since
it
had
died
away
the
second
time
there
was
only
silence
on
the
deck
save
for
the
carpenter
rambling
talk
the
lad
mind
leaped
nimbly
from
one
occurrence
to
another
in
search
for
an
explanation
of
the
cry
tell
me
said
he
what
happened
on
shore
at
this
the
carpenter
laughed
pleased
with
believing
he
had
got
the
boatswain
thoughts
off
the
affair
of
the
moment
why
little
enough
they
would
have
persuaded
us
to
leave
our
weapons
at
the
door
but
the
old
one
was
too
wise
a
horse
to
be
caught
by
the
rattle
of
oats
and
whilst
he
was
ducking
and
smiling
and
waving
hands
with
the
spaniards
i
myself
my
ears
being
keen
heard
one
cry
in
spanish
for
i
have
a
proper
understanding
of
spanish
which
i
got
by
many
pains
and
much
listening
as
i
was
saying
i
heard
one
cry
in
spanish
that
is
he
and
said
i
to
myself
heaven
keep
us
where
have
i
heard
that
voice
and
then
it
came
upon
me
and
i
cried
in
english
of
us
knew
the
dog
will
canty
could
talk
spanish
whereat
the
old
one
hearing
me
turned
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
will
in
the
darkness
you
know
his
way
a
shrewd
blade
but
cries
he
my
man
seize
him
and
with
that
i
being
nearest
made
a
leap
and
they
being
at
the
moment
all
oil
to
soothe
our
feelings
and
hood
our
eyes
were
off
their
guard
so
the
old
one
who
likely
enough
had
heard
for
himself
will
canty
saying
since
he
too
hath
a
curious
knowledge
of
spanish
cries
to
the
boat
my
lads
for
seest
thou
if
will
canty
was
pointing
out
this
one
or
that
there
was
treacherous
work
in
the
wind
so
down
through
them
we
rushed
all
together
bearing
will
with
us
by
the
suddenness
and
audacity
of
our
act
and
so
away
in
a
boat
before
they
knew
our
thought
and
who
were
the
other
englishmen
the
carpenter
gave
the
lad
a
blank
look
why
there
were
none
rising
phil
paced
the
deck
while
the
carpenter
and
the
others
watched
him
some
scowled
and
whispered
suspicions
and
others
denied
them
until
phil
himself
heard
one
crying
nay
nay
he
a
true
lad
is
only
he
hath
a
liking
for
the
fellow
the
carpenter
neither
smiled
nor
frowned
for
though
he
knew
no
loyalty
deeper
than
his
selfish
interests
and
though
he
felt
no
qualm
regarding
that
which
was
going
on
in
the
cabin
since
he
had
little
love
for
the
poor
wretch
who
was
the
victim
he
had
a
very
kindly
feeling
toward
those
who
got
his
liking
and
it
sorely
troubled
him
that
philip
marsham
should
suffer
thus
though
it
were
at
second
hand
come
lad
said
he
sit
down
here
and
take
comfort
in
the
fine
night
laying
his
elbows
on
the
rail
phil
thrust
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
bit
his
two
lips
and
stared
at
the
distant
shore
of
cuba
he
feared
neither
indians
nor
insects
nor
the
inquisition
there
were
other
things
to
his
mind
more
fearful
than
these
the
gasping
sound
that
then
came
from
the
cabin
was
one
thing
more
than
he
could
abide
he
turned
with
the
drawn
dirk
in
his
hand
but
the
carpenter
was
on
him
from
behind
whispering
come
lad
come
and
because
he
could
not
but
be
aware
of
the
carpenter
honest
good
will
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
use
the
dirk
yet
only
by
using
the
dirk
could
he
have
got
out
of
the
long
arms
that
held
him
fast
for
a
moment
they
swayed
back
and
forth
then
when
others
were
hurrying
to
aid
the
carpenter
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
opened
a
rumble
of
laughter
issued
then
the
old
one
voice
lay
him
here
in
the
steerage
and
shackle
him
fast
to
the
mizzen
he
may
well
be
thankful
that
i
am
a
merciful
man
chapter
xviii
tom
jordan
mercy
they
anchored
that
noon
in
a
great
bay
surrounded
by
forests
and
mountains
which
formed
a
harbour
wherein
a
thousand
sail
of
tall
ships
might
have
lain
through
the
long
afternoon
while
the
rose
of
devon
swung
at
her
anchor
the
wind
stirred
the
palms
and
a
wild
stream
plunging
in
a
succession
of
falls
down
a
mountainside
shone
like
a
silver
thread
but
paul
craig
sat
guard
over
will
canty
who
lay
in
the
steerage
chained
to
the
mizzenmast
and
there
was
no
chance
for
any
one
of
the
men
to
speak
with
will
and
on
deck
the
carpenter
measured
and
sawed
and
planed
for
his
purpose
and
having
shaped
his
stock
he
wrought
a
coffin
first
he
threw
nails
in
a
little
heap
on
the
deck
then
kneeling
he
drove
them
home
into
the
planed
boards
it
was
and
the
noise
went
through
the
ship
while
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
some
chuckled
and
said
that
the
old
one
was
a
rare
bird
but
the
old
one
coming
out
of
the
great
cabin
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
lad
who
lay
chained
to
the
mast
stood
a
long
time
beside
the
carpenter
he
kept
a
grave
face
while
he
watched
him
work
and
very
serious
he
looked
when
he
turned
away
and
came
and
stood
beside
philip
marsham
there
are
men
that
would
slit
the
fellow
throat
he
said
or
burn
him
at
stake
or
flay
him
alive
but
i
have
a
tender
heart
and
am
by
nature
merciful
though
he
broke
faith
and
dipped
his
hands
in
black
treachery
i
bear
him
no
ill
will
i
must
needs
twist
his
thumbs
to
wring
his
secrets
out
of
him
and
i
can
no
longer
keep
him
about
me
yet
as
i
have
said
i
bear
him
no
ill
will
saw
you
ever
a
finer
coffin
than
the
one
i
have
ordered
made
for
him
what
could
a
man
reply
although
there
had
been
complaining
and
revolt
before
the
old
one
again
held
the
ship
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
for
they
feared
his
irony
more
than
his
anger
darkness
came
and
they
lowered
the
coffin
into
the
boat
whither
man
after
man
slid
down
come
boatswain
said
the
old
one
in
a
quiet
solemn
voice
there
is
an
oar
to
pull
and
what
could
a
man
do
but
slide
with
the
others
down
into
the
boat
and
rest
on
the
loom
of
an
oar
phil
shared
a
thwart
with
the
carpenter
and
raised
his
oar
and
held
it
upright
between
his
knees
the
coffin
lay
across
the
boat
amidships
and
there
were
four
oars
two
on
the
one
side
and
two
on
the
other
but
a
man
sat
beside
each
oarsman
two
more
crowded
into
the
bow
and
two
sat
in
the
stern
sheets
with
the
old
one
then
they
lowered
will
canty
to
the
bottom
in
front
of
the
old
one
where
he
lay
bound
hand
and
foot
shoving
off
from
the
ship
the
oarsmen
bent
to
their
task
and
the
old
one
steered
with
a
sweep
but
the
boat
was
crowded
and
deep
in
the
water
and
they
made
slow
progress
mosquitoes
swarmed
about
them
and
droned
interminably
the
water
licked
at
the
boat
and
lapped
on
the
white
beach
the
wind
stirred
in
the
palms
the
great
bay
with
its
mountains
and
its
starry
sky
was
as
fair
a
piece
of
land
and
sea
as
a
man
might
wish
to
look
upon
in
his
last
hour
but
there
are
few
men
whose
philosophy
will
stand
by
them
at
such
a
moment
and
there
is
an
odd
quirk
in
human
nature
whereby
a
mere
droning
mosquito
can
drive
out
of
mind
the
beauty
of
sea
and
land
nay
even
thoughts
of
an
immeasurable
universe
the
men
beat
at
mosquitoes
and
swore
wickedly
until
the
old
one
bade
them
be
silent
and
row
on
for
although
they
had
come
near
the
shore
the
water
was
still
deep
under
the
boat
which
tossed
gently
in
the
starlight
a
time
followed
in
which
the
only
sounds
were
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
men
some
were
turning
their
heads
to
see
the
shore
and
the
old
one
had
already
risen
to
choose
a
when
will
canty
who
although
bound
hand
and
foot
had
all
the
while
been
edging
about
in
the
stern
unknown
to
the
others
till
he
had
braced
his
feet
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
get
purchase
for
a
leap
gave
a
great
spring
from
where
he
lay
and
thus
threw
himself
up
and
fell
with
his
back
across
the
gunwale
whence
wriggling
like
a
worm
he
strove
to
push
himself
over
the
side
the
old
one
sprang
forward
in
fury
to
seize
and
hold
him
and
caught
him
by
the
wrist
but
one
of
the
men
in
zeal
to
have
a
hand
in
the
affair
drove
the
butt
of
his
gun
against
will
canty
chin
and
in
recovering
the
piece
he
stumbled
and
pushed
the
old
one
off
his
balance
so
the
old
one
lost
his
hold
on
will
canty
wrist
and
before
the
rest
knew
what
was
happening
will
had
slipped
into
the
deep
water
and
had
sunk
that
he
never
rose
was
doubtless
the
best
fortune
that
could
have
befallen
him
and
likely
enough
it
was
the
blow
of
the
gun
that
killed
him
but
the
old
one
was
roused
to
such
a
pitch
of
wrath
at
being
balked
of
his
revenge
that
he
was
like
a
wild
beast
in
his
fury
quicker
than
thought
he
turned
on
the
man
who
had
pushed
against
him
and
reaching
for
the
coffin
that
was
made
to
will
measure
a
great
heavy
box
it
was
raised
it
high
and
flung
it
at
the
fellow
it
gashed
the
man
forehead
and
fell
over
the
side
and
floated
away
and
the
man
himself
with
a
string
of
oaths
clapped
his
hand
to
the
wound
whence
the
blood
trickled
out
between
his
fingers
swine
ass
the
old
one
snarled
i
was
of
a
mind
to
lay
thee
in
will
canty
bed
but
let
the
coffin
go
th
art
not
worthy
of
it
the
boat
grated
on
white
sand
and
leaping
to
his
feet
the
old
one
cried
with
a
high
laugh
as
he
marked
his
victim
fear
get
thee
gone
if
ever
i
see
thy
face
again
i
will
slit
thy
throat
from
ear
to
ear
nay
nay
do
not
send
me
away
do
not
send
me
away
the
man
wailed
o
god
no
not
that
i
shall
perish
of
indians
and
spaniards
the
wild
beasts
will
devour
me
nay
nay
the
old
one
smiled
and
reached
for
a
musket
and
the
poor
fellow
his
face
streaked
with
gore
was
overcome
by
the
greater
terror
and
fled
away
under
the
palms
no
shot
was
fired
and
neither
knife
nor
sword
was
drawn
ere
the
echo
of
the
fellow
wailing
died
into
silence
but
the
old
one
then
fired
a
single
shot
after
him
which
evoked
a
last
scream
come
martin
take
the
scoundrel
oar
quoth
the
old
one
and
he
turned
the
head
of
the
boat
to
sea
they
said
little
and
were
glad
to
row
briskly
out
to
the
ship
action
is
ever
welcome
at
the
time
when
a
man
desires
most
of
all
to
get
away
from
memory
and
thought
that
night
when
they
were
all
asleep
martin
leaped
out
on
the
deck
and
woke
them
by
shrieking
like
a
lunatic
until
it
seemed
they
were
all
transported
into
bedlam
he
then
himself
awoke
but
he
would
say
only
my
god
what
a
dream
oh
what
a
dream
and
he
would
rub
his
hands
across
his
eyes
the
grumblers
continued
quietly
to
grumble
for
that
is
a
joy
no
power
on
earth
can
take
away
but
there
was
no
more
talk
of
another
captain
some
said
that
now
the
luck
would
change
and
told
of
prizes
they
had
taken
and
would
take
and
recalled
to
mind
the
strong
liquors
of
bideford
and
the
pasties
that
mother
taylor
would
make
for
them
others
although
they
said
little
shook
their
heads
and
appeared
to
wish
themselves
far
away
but
whether
a
man
felt
thus
or
otherwise
there
was
small
profit
of
their
talking
for
another
day
and
night
they
lay
at
anchor
and
ate
and
drank
and
sprawled
out
in
the
sun
the
rose
of
devon
as
they
had
earlier
had
occasion
to
remark
was
richly
found
and
they
had
still
no
need
to
bestir
themselves
for
food
and
drink
but
any
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
must
perceive
that
with
old
jacob
who
had
gone
so
wisely
about
his
duties
and
had
so
well
held
his
own
counsel
in
many
things
the
ship
had
lost
something
of
stability
and
firm
purpose
even
in
her
lawless
pursuits
and
will
canty
too
was
gone
as
the
old
writer
has
it
one
is
choked
with
a
fly
another
with
a
hair
a
third
pushing
his
foot
against
the
trestle
another
against
the
threshold
falls
down
dead
so
many
kind
of
ways
are
chalked
out
for
man
to
draw
towards
his
last
home
and
wean
him
from
the
love
of
earth
though
will
canty
had
died
a
hard
death
he
had
escaped
worse
and
as
priam
numbering
more
days
than
troilus
shed
more
tears
so
philip
marsham
outliving
his
friend
faced
such
times
as
the
other
was
spared
knowing
of
all
this
he
thought
at
length
and
fearing
his
own
conscience
more
than
all
the
familiars
of
the
inquisition
in
which
he
was
singularly
heartened
by
remembering
the
stout
old
knight
in
the
scarlet
cloak
he
contrived
a
plan
and
bode
his
time
in
the
darkness
of
the
second
night
when
the
old
one
had
somewhat
relaxed
his
watchfulness
boatswain
marsham
slipped
over
the
bow
and
lowered
himself
silently
on
a
rope
he
had
procured
for
the
purpose
and
very
carefully
lest
the
noise
be
heard
on
board
the
ship
seated
himself
in
tom
jordan
boat
and
rowed
for
shore
an
honest
man
can
go
so
far
in
a
company
of
rogues
and
no
farther
reaching
the
land
and
hauling
the
boat
up
on
the
beach
in
plain
sight
of
those
left
in
the
rose
of
devon
where
they
might
swim
for
it
if
they
would
he
set
off
across
the
hills
and
under
the
palms
upon
reaching
the
height
he
looked
back
and
for
a
moment
watched
the
old
ship
as
she
swung
with
the
tide
on
the
still
clear
water
he
hoped
he
should
never
see
her
again
then
he
looked
down
at
the
tremulous
and
shimmering
bay
where
will
canty
lay
dead
and
was
glad
to
plunge
over
the
hill
and
leave
the
bay
behind
him
chapter
xix
a
man
seen
before
there
was
sullen
anger
and
worse
in
the
rose
of
devon
when
day
broke
for
the
boatswain
too
had
gone
and
the
boat
lay
in
sight
upon
the
beach
whereby
all
might
know
the
means
of
his
going
one
watching
from
the
mountain
would
have
seen
the
rose
of
devon
spread
her
sails
and
put
to
sea
like
a
great
bird
with
white
wings
but
there
was
no
one
on
the
mountain
to
watch
and
when
the
ship
had
sailed
no
human
being
remained
to
interrupt
the
placid
calm
that
overspread
the
bay
that
summer
morning
the
sun
blazed
from
a
clear
sky
and
the
green
palms
rustled
and
swayed
beside
the
blue
water
and
in
all
the
marvelously
fair
prospect
of
land
and
sea
no
sign
or
mark
of
violence
remained
phil
marsham
had
gone
in
the
night
over
the
hills
and
across
the
narrow
peninsula
between
two
bays
though
the
way
was
rough
the
land
was
high
and
for
the
tropics
open
and
he
had
put
the
peninsula
behind
him
by
sunrise
he
had
then
plunged
down
into
a
swampy
region
but
finding
the
tangle
of
vines
and
canes
well
nigh
impassable
in
the
dark
he
had
struggled
round
it
and
had
again
come
to
the
shore
there
finding
once
more
a
place
where
a
man
could
walk
easily
he
had
pressed
on
at
dawn
through
a
forest
of
tall
trees
in
infinite
number
and
variety
with
flowers
and
fruits
in
abundance
and
past
a
plain
of
high
grass
of
wonderful
greenness
a
short
time
after
sunrise
he
drank
from
a
spring
of
water
and
ate
ship
bread
from
the
small
store
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
but
he
dared
not
linger
and
resuming
his
journey
he
came
upon
two
huts
where
nets
and
were
spread
in
the
sun
to
dry
the
heat
which
seemed
to
swell
from
the
very
earth
by
then
so
sorely
oppressed
him
that
he
stopped
for
a
while
in
a
shady
place
to
rest
but
still
he
dared
not
stay
and
although
upon
again
arising
he
saw
that
dark
clouds
were
covering
the
sky
he
once
more
stepped
forth
with
such
a
stout
heart
as
had
carried
him
out
of
london
and
all
the
long
way
to
bideford
in
devon
it
gave
him
a
queer
feeling
to
be
tramping
through
an
unknown
land
with
no
destination
in
his
mind
yet
he
vowed
to
himself
that
come
what
might
he
would
never
go
back
to
the
rose
of
devon
there
is
a
time
when
patience
and
forbearance
are
enough
to
earn
a
man
a
hempen
halter
and
thinking
thus
he
faced
the
storm
and
renewed
his
determination
the
wind
rose
to
a
furious
gale
the
clouds
overswept
the
sky
and
thunder
shook
the
earth
and
heavens
the
rain
sweeping
down
in
slanting
lines
cut
through
the
palm
leaves
like
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
thrusting
swords
and
lightning
flamed
and
flashed
and
leaped
from
horizon
to
horizon
and
hung
in
a
sort
of
continual
cloud
of
deathly
blue
in
the
zenith
blazing
and
quivering
with
appalling
reverberations
that
went
booming
off
through
the
mountains
and
came
rolling
back
in
ponderous
echoes
it
was
enough
to
make
a
brave
man
think
the
black
angels
were
marshalling
for
the
last
great
battle
it
was
such
a
storm
as
a
boy
born
in
england
and
taught
his
seamanship
in
northern
waters
knew
only
by
sailors
tales
the
rain
beat
through
the
poor
shelter
that
he
found
and
drenched
him
to
the
skin
and
the
roaring
and
thundering
of
the
tempest
filled
him
with
awe
and
when
the
storm
had
passed
for
it
lasted
not
above
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
sun
came
out
again
and
filled
the
air
with
a
steamy
warmth
that
was
oppressive
beyond
description
then
the
woods
came
to
life
and
insects
stirred
and
droned
and
mosquitoes
issuing
from
among
the
leaves
and
grasses
plagued
him
to
the
verge
of
madness
one
who
has
lived
always
in
a
land
where
mosquitoes
return
each
year
in
summer
is
likely
to
have
no
conception
of
the
venomous
strength
with
which
their
poison
can
work
upon
one
who
has
not
by
much
experience
of
their
bites
built
up
a
measure
of
resistance
against
it
phil
hands
swelled
until
he
could
not
shut
them
and
the
swelling
of
his
face
so
nearly
closed
his
eyes
that
he
could
hardly
see
when
two
hours
later
all
but
blinded
and
thirsting
and
hungry
he
came
again
to
the
shore
and
made
out
in
the
offing
by
squinting
between
swollen
eyelids
the
same
rose
of
devon
from
which
he
had
run
away
and
to
which
he
had
vowed
he
would
never
return
his
misery
was
such
that
he
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
be
on
board
her
and
away
from
such
torment
though
they
ended
the
day
by
hanging
him
but
the
rose
of
devon
sailed
away
over
the
blue
sea
on
which
the
sun
shone
as
calmly
and
steadily
as
if
there
had
been
no
tempest
and
philip
marsham
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
gave
himself
up
as
a
man
already
dead
there
two
natives
of
the
country
found
him
and
by
grace
of
god
who
tempered
their
hearts
with
mercy
carried
him
to
their
poor
hut
and
tended
him
with
their
simple
remedies
until
he
was
in
such
measure
recovered
of
the
poison
that
he
could
see
as
well
as
ever
he
then
set
out
once
more
upon
his
way
to
he
knew
not
where
having
rubbed
himself
with
an
ointment
of
vile
odour
which
they
gave
him
in
goodly
quantity
to
keep
off
all
pestiferous
insects
and
on
the
day
when
he
ate
the
last
morsel
of
the
food
with
which
the
natives
had
provided
him
he
saw
from
the
side
of
a
high
hill
a
strange
ship
at
anchor
in
a
cove
beneath
now
a
ship
might
mean
one
thing
or
she
might
mean
another
and
a
life
might
depend
on
the
difference
drinking
deeply
from
a
stream
that
ran
over
the
rocks
and
through
the
forest
and
so
at
last
into
the
cove
philip
marsham
returned
into
the
wood
and
sat
upon
a
fallen
tree
he
saw
a
boat
put
out
from
the
ship
and
touch
on
the
shore
a
long
way
off
where
some
men
left
her
and
went
out
of
sight
after
an
hour
or
two
they
came
back
and
entering
the
boat
returned
to
the
ship
he
saw
men
working
on
deck
and
in
the
rigging
he
heard
the
piping
of
a
whistle
and
now
and
again
as
the
wind
changed
he
heard
more
faintly
than
the
drone
of
insects
the
voices
of
the
men
being
high
above
the
shore
he
found
the
mosquitoes
fewer
and
the
wind
helped
drive
them
away
yet
they
plagued
him
continually
despite
his
ointment
of
which
little
was
left
and
made
him
miserable
while
he
stayed
he
would
have
hurried
off
had
he
dared
but
the
chance
that
the
ship
would
be
the
means
of
saving
his
life
withheld
him
from
pursuing
his
journey
while
doubt
concerning
the
manner
of
craft
she
was
withheld
him
from
making
known
his
presence
in
he
saw
far
away
a
sail
which
came
slowly
in
across
the
blue
plain
of
the
sea
and
having
clear
eyes
trained
by
long
practice
he
descried
even
at
that
great
distance
the
motion
of
a
heavily
rolling
ship
from
his
seat
high
on
the
hill
he
could
see
a
long
way
farther
than
the
men
in
the
ship
in
the
cove
and
a
point
of
land
shut
off
from
them
an
arc
of
the
sea
that
was
visible
from
the
hill
so
when
night
fell
they
were
still
unaware
of
the
sail
though
he
had
watched
for
hours
the
ship
in
the
cove
the
runaway
boatswain
of
the
rose
of
devon
had
discovered
no
sign
of
what
nation
had
sent
her
out
or
what
trade
her
men
followed
but
there
came
a
time
when
his
patience
could
endure
suspense
no
longer
he
picked
his
way
down
to
the
shore
following
the
stream
from
which
he
had
been
drinking
during
his
long
watch
and
cautiously
moved
along
the
edge
of
the
water
till
he
came
to
the
point
of
land
nearest
the
anchored
ship
whence
he
could
very
plainly
hear
voices
on
board
her
there
were
lights
on
the
stern
and
on
deck
and
through
an
open
port
he
got
sight
of
hammocks
swinging
above
the
guns
on
the
main
deck
at
last
he
took
off
the
greater
part
of
his
clothes
and
piled
them
on
a
rock
then
strapping
his
dirk
to
his
waist
he
waded
silently
into
the
water
reaching
his
depth
he
momentarily
hesitated
but
fortifying
his
resolution
with
such
philosophy
as
he
could
muster
he
began
deliberately
and
silently
to
swim
letting
himself
lie
deep
in
the
water
and
moving
so
slowly
that
he
raised
no
wake
he
came
into
the
shadow
of
the
ship
it
was
good
to
feel
her
rough
planking
he
swam
aft
under
the
quarter
and
coming
to
the
rudder
laid
hands
on
it
and
rested
above
him
he
could
see
upon
looking
up
a
lighted
his
own
body
seemed
ponderous
as
he
slowly
lifted
himself
out
of
water
he
raised
one
hand
from
the
tip
of
the
rudder
just
above
the
tiller
to
the
carving
overhead
and
got
grip
on
a
scroll
wrought
in
tough
oak
he
put
his
foot
on
the
rudder
and
feeling
above
him
with
his
other
hand
seized
fast
the
leg
of
a
carved
dragon
very
thankful
for
the
brave
ornaments
with
which
the
builder
had
bedecked
the
ship
he
next
got
hold
of
the
dragon
snout
and
clinging
like
a
fly
unseen
and
unsuspected
above
the
black
water
that
gurgled
about
the
rudder
and
the
hull
he
crawled
silently
up
the
stern
coming
thus
to
the
lighted
cabin
window
he
peeked
in
and
found
the
place
deserted
on
the
table
a
cloth
was
laid
and
on
the
cloth
such
a
dinner
service
as
he
could
scarce
have
dreamed
of
there
were
glasses
of
rare
tints
with
a
few
drops
of
wine
left
in
them
which
glowed
like
garnets
under
the
bright
candles
there
were
goblets
of
silver
and
even
he
believed
of
gold
there
were
wonderfully
delicate
plates
crusted
with
gold
about
the
edges
there
was
an
abundance
of
silver
to
eat
with
and
a
great
decanter
wrought
about
with
gold
and
precious
stones
such
as
simple
folk
might
not
expect
to
see
this
side
of
heaven
at
the
sound
of
steps
phil
drew
back
and
hung
over
the
water
on
the
great
stern
of
the
ship
a
boy
came
into
the
cabin
and
stepped
briskly
about
clearing
the
table
voices
came
down
from
above
and
they
were
speaking
in
english
what
a
prize
she
would
have
made
for
the
rose
of
devon
phil
thought
and
grimly
smiled
boy
a
voice
bellowed
from
somewhere
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
yea
yea
master
cried
the
boy
and
with
that
he
scurried
from
the
cabin
like
a
startled
chick
phil
raised
his
head
and
renewed
his
hold
for
he
could
not
cling
there
forever
yet
how
to
introduce
himself
on
board
the
ship
was
a
question
that
sorely
puzzled
him
he
threw
a
bare
leg
over
the
sill
the
more
easily
to
rest
and
revolved
the
problem
in
his
mind
they
were
plainly
honest
englishmen
and
right
glad
would
he
have
been
to
get
himself
in
among
them
yet
if
he
came
like
a
thief
in
the
night
they
must
suspect
him
of
evil
intentions
without
end
while
he
thus
attacked
the
problem
from
one
side
and
from
the
other
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
best
way
was
to
crawl
down
again
into
the
water
and
swim
back
to
the
shore
from
whence
he
had
come
there
having
donned
his
clothes
he
would
call
for
help
surely
there
was
no
one
so
hard
of
heart
as
to
refuse
a
lad
help
in
escaping
from
the
pirates
he
raised
his
leg
to
swing
it
out
of
the
window
again
and
put
his
scheme
into
practice
when
he
felt
and
it
startled
him
nearly
out
of
his
skin
a
hand
lay
hold
on
his
ankle
if
you
will
balance
yourself
on
the
outside
of
any
window
with
one
foot
over
the
sill
you
will
find
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
pull
your
foot
away
from
some
one
inside
the
window
without
throwing
yourself
off
the
wall
and
phil
for
the
moment
was
reluctant
to
make
the
plunge
slowly
at
first
he
twisted
and
pulled
but
to
no
purpose
with
waxing
vigour
he
struggled
and
yanked
and
kicked
and
jerked
but
completely
failed
to
get
his
ankle
out
of
the
hand
that
held
it
it
seemed
that
a
gentleman
who
had
been
sitting
at
a
little
desk
so
placed
that
phil
could
not
have
seen
it
without
thrusting
his
head
all
the
way
into
the
cabin
had
looked
up
and
perceiving
to
his
mild
surprise
a
naked
foot
thrust
in
through
the
window
had
nimbly
arisen
and
stepping
lightly
toward
the
foot
had
seized
the
ankle
firmly
at
the
moment
when
phil
was
about
to
withdraw
it
the
gentleman
marvelled
much
at
what
he
had
discovered
and
purposed
to
get
at
the
reason
for
it
not
only
did
he
succeed
with
ease
in
holding
the
ankle
fast
against
his
captive
somewhat
cautious
first
kicks
he
anticipated
a
more
desperate
effort
by
getting
firm
hold
with
both
hands
so
that
when
his
captive
decided
to
risk
all
so
to
speak
and
tried
with
might
and
main
to
fling
himself
free
and
into
the
water
by
a
great
leap
the
gentleman
kept
fast
his
hold
and
held
the
lad
by
his
one
leg
who
dangled
below
like
a
trapped
monkey
very
likely
it
was
foolish
of
philip
marsham
to
attempt
escaping
but
as
i
have
said
he
was
of
no
mind
to
be
caught
thus
like
a
thief
entering
in
the
night
and
he
was
so
completely
surprised
that
he
had
no
time
at
all
to
collect
his
wits
before
he
acted
yet
caught
he
was
and
for
a
bad
bargain
hung
by
the
heels
to
boot
boy
the
gentleman
said
and
his
voice
indicated
that
he
had
a
droll
humour
call
captain
winterton
the
boy
further
sounds
revealed
who
had
come
silently
and
in
leisure
departed
noisily
and
in
haste
heavy
steps
then
approached
and
a
gruff
voice
cried
what
devilish
sort
of
game
is
this
take
his
other
leg
charles
and
we
shall
soon
have
him
safe
on
board
i
am
not
yet
prepared
to
say
what
sort
of
game
it
is
beyond
saying
that
it
is
a
rare
and
curious
game
thereupon
a
second
pair
of
hands
closed
on
philip
marsham
other
ankle
and
would
he
or
would
he
not
he
was
hauled
speedily
through
the
cabin
window
young
man
said
the
gentleman
who
had
first
seized
him
who
and
what
are
you
and
from
whence
have
you
come
i
am
philip
marsham
late
boatswain
of
the
rose
of
devon
frigate
i
came
to
learn
from
what
country
this
ship
had
sailed
and
to
ask
for
help
i
myself
sailed
from
bideford
long
since
in
the
rose
of
devon
but
falling
into
the
hands
of
certain
sailors
of
fortune
who
killed
our
master
and
took
our
ship
i
have
served
them
for
weary
months
as
a
forced
man
having
at
last
succeeded
in
running
away
from
them
i
have
come
hither
by
land
as
you
can
see
suffering
much
on
the
way
and
i
ask
you
now
to
have
compassion
on
me
in
god
name
and
take
me
home
to
england
truly
said
the
gentleman
those
devilish
flies
have
wrought
their
worst
upon
him
his
face
is
swelled
till
it
is
as
as
a
guinea
slave
he
spoke
lightly
and
with
little
thought
of
words
for
his
humour
was
uppermost
in
him
he
was
in
every
way
the
fine
gentleman
with
an
eye
for
the
comical
accustomed
to
having
all
things
done
for
him
and
as
little
likely
to
feel
pity
for
this
nearly
naked
youth
as
to
think
it
wrong
that
the
little
cabin
boy
should
stand
till
morning
behind
his
chair
lest
by
chance
desiring
one
thing
or
another
he
must
compromise
his
dignity
by
fetching
it
for
himself
but
now
the
other
captain
winterton
a
tall
grave
man
with
cold
face
and
hard
cold
eyes
stepped
forward
and
speaking
for
the
first
time
said
do
you
remember
me
phil
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
felt
his
heart
sink
but
he
was
no
coward
i
do
he
replied
captain
winterton
smiled
he
was
the
first
of
the
three
men
who
had
come
on
board
the
rose
of
devon
by
way
of
her
gallery
and
had
entered
the
great
cabin
the
night
when
phil
marsham
sat
there
at
supper
it
then
burst
upon
phil
that
in
the
whole
plain
truth
lay
his
only
hope
i
ran
away
from
them
they
had
forced
me
into
their
service
a
week
since
nay
it
is
true
i
am
no
liar
and
it
will
pay
you
well
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
this
night
for
a
vessel
like
enough
to
the
rose
of
devon
to
be
her
twin
is
this
minute
lying
behind
yonder
point
ah
and
you
sailed
i
believe
you
said
from
bideford
doubtless
you
have
kept
the
day
in
mind
why
was
in
early
may
or
stay
was
enough
enough
the
master
of
but
though
i
marked
neither
the
day
of
the
week
nor
the
day
of
the
month
i
remember
the
sailing
well
doubtless
quoth
the
captain
dryly
but
it
will
save
time
and
serve
thy
cause
to
speak
only
when
i
bid
thee
interrupt
me
not
but
tell
me
next
the
name
of
the
lawful
master
in
whose
charge
thy
most
excellent
ship
sailed
from
bideford
this
keen
and
quiet
captain
in
the
king
service
was
of
no
mind
that
his
prisoner
should
tell
with
impunity
such
a
story
as
he
might
make
up
on
the
moment
accordingly
he
proceeded
to
draw
forth
by
question
after
question
such
particular
parts
of
the
story
as
he
himself
desired
to
hear
now
attacking
the
matter
from
one
angle
and
now
from
another
watching
his
prisoner
closely
the
while
and
all
the
time
standing
in
such
a
place
that
the
lad
had
no
chance
at
all
of
escaping
through
the
open
window
chapter
xx
a
prize
for
the
taking
we
shall
see
said
captain
winterton
when
he
had
listened
to
all
of
the
tale
that
he
would
hear
he
turned
about
boy
he
cried
go
speedily
and
send
rance
in
to
me
the
boy
departed
in
haste
and
in
a
moment
there
entered
a
junior
officer
who
stared
in
frank
curiosity
at
the
three
in
the
cabin
rance
said
the
captain
go
aloft
in
person
to
the
main
truck
and
look
about
you
sharply
come
back
and
report
what
you
see
yea
yea
sir
the
young
man
replied
and
with
that
he
was
gone
the
captain
stood
by
the
cabin
window
and
frowned
plainly
he
had
small
confidence
in
the
good
faith
of
the
prisoner
and
regarded
his
story
as
at
best
an
attempt
to
save
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
friends
the
gentleman
of
the
humours
somewhat
sobered
by
the
captain
manner
of
grave
concern
returned
to
his
desk
but
sat
tapping
his
fingers
and
watching
philip
marsham
it
had
instantly
of
course
dawned
upon
the
runaway
boatswain
that
his
peril
was
more
serious
than
he
had
had
reason
earlier
to
believe
for
supposing
the
unknown
sail
should
in
all
truth
be
the
rose
of
devon
and
since
she
was
cruising
idly
thereabouts
nothing
was
more
probable
he
stood
between
the
devil
or
at
all
events
the
own
emissary
thomas
jordan
and
a
deeper
sea
than
any
ship
has
ever
sailed
the
sea
upon
which
many
a
man
with
less
plain
evidence
of
piracy
against
him
has
embarked
from
a
yardarm
with
a
hempen
collar
about
his
neck
and
a
black
cap
over
his
eyes
who
pray
would
accept
for
sober
truth
such
a
tale
as
any
scoundrel
would
make
out
of
whole
cloth
to
save
himself
from
hanging
despite
all
he
could
do
or
say
he
now
saw
plainly
he
must
stand
convicted
in
their
minds
of
being
at
the
very
least
a
spy
sent
to
learn
the
state
of
affairs
on
board
this
tall
ship
in
which
he
was
now
a
prisoner
then
back
to
the
cabin
came
young
rance
and
very
much
excited
did
he
appear
sir
he
exclaimed
and
stood
in
the
door
tell
your
tale
a
ship
lieth
two
cable
lengths
from
land
on
the
farther
side
of
the
point
and
a
boat
hath
set
out
from
her
and
is
following
the
shore
as
if
to
reconnoitre
ah
said
the
captain
it
is
quite
as
i
thought
no
drums
mind
you
nor
trumpets
rance
call
the
men
to
quarters
by
word
of
mouth
make
haste
and
put
springs
on
the
cables
if
there
be
time
before
the
boat
rounds
the
point
bid
the
gunner
make
all
preparations
for
action
and
order
a
sharp
watch
kept
but
order
also
that
there
be
no
sound
or
appearance
of
unusual
activity
send
me
a
corporal
and
a
file
of
men
and
the
master
the
gentleman
at
the
desk
chuckled
come
boy
clear
the
table
said
the
captain
the
boy
jumped
and
returned
to
his
work
the
master
came
first
but
the
corporal
and
his
men
were
close
at
the
master
heels
take
this
fellow
to
the
gun
room
clap
him
into
irons
and
set
a
man
to
watch
him
yea
yea
come
fellow
march
along
and
thus
sending
before
them
boatswain
marsham
erstwhile
of
the
rose
of
devon
frigate
the
corporal
and
his
men
departed
from
the
cabin
there
were
guns
on
the
right
hand
and
the
left
ordnance
of
a
size
to
sink
the
rose
of
devon
with
a
broadside
there
were
sailormen
thronging
in
numbers
to
appall
the
young
prisoner
who
came
down
among
them
nearly
naked
from
his
swim
though
no
greater
of
burthen
than
the
rose
of
devon
the
ship
was
better
armed
and
better
manned
and
all
signs
told
of
the
stern
discipline
of
a
the
alternatives
that
phil
marsham
faced
as
he
sat
in
shackles
with
no
spirit
to
reply
to
the
jibes
of
the
sailors
and
watched
men
stripped
to
the
waist
and
moving
deftly
among
the
guns
were
not
those
a
man
would
choose
if
his
old
shipmates
took
this
tall
and
handsome
ship
a
blow
on
the
head
and
a
burial
over
the
side
was
the
kindest
treatment
he
could
expect
of
them
and
if
not
the
gallows
loomed
beyond
a
court
of
admiralty
for
hours
the
hum
of
voices
went
up
and
down
the
main
deck
and
for
hours
boatswain
marsham
sat
with
the
bolts
upon
his
legs
and
wrists
and
saw
the
life
of
the
ship
go
on
around
him
the
men
leaped
here
and
there
at
a
word
or
lolled
by
their
guns
waiting
for
orders
the
night
wore
on
and
nodding
phil
thought
of
the
two
ships
lying
one
on
each
side
of
the
point
of
land
and
by
all
appearances
two
quiet
merchantmen
yet
one
he
knew
to
his
sorrow
smelled
devilishly
of
brimstone
and
the
other
in
which
he
now
sat
a
prisoner
though
her
ports
were
closed
and
her
claws
sheathed
was
like
some
great
tiger
watching
through
eyes
a
bold
adventurous
goat
as
the
night
wore
on
he
dared
hope
that
the
reconnoitering
boat
had
returned
to
her
ship
with
news
that
had
sent
her
away
in
haste
whereby
there
was
a
chance
that
his
tale
might
yet
be
taken
for
the
truth
that
it
was
and
the
longer
he
waited
the
higher
rose
his
hope
and
with
the
better
reason
but
an
hour
or
more
after
midnight
he
heard
men
beginning
to
talk
as
if
there
was
something
new
in
the
wind
and
the
nearest
gunner
put
his
ear
to
a
the
dogs
are
out
i
hear
oars
he
whispered
yea
though
they
are
rowing
softly
i
swear
i
can
hear
oars
a
hush
came
over
the
ship
and
those
below
heard
faintly
a
hail
given
on
deck
distant
sounds
came
and
went
like
whispers
out
of
the
sky
then
somewhere
outside
the
ship
a
great
shouting
arose
and
one
of
the
men
at
a
starboard
gun
cried
gleefully
with
a
round
oath
verily
they
are
bent
on
boarding
us
lads
their
foolish
audacity
seasons
the
term
of
all
our
weary
waiting
hark
they
are
hailing
cried
another
come
strike
your
flag
have
an
end
of
all
this
talk
a
distant
voice
called
whereat
philip
marsham
who
knew
the
voice
thought
that
though
their
audacity
cost
him
his
life
it
was
in
its
own
mad
way
superb
the
reply
was
inaudible
below
but
a
boat
crashed
against
the
ship
there
was
a
burst
of
yelling
followed
by
a
rattle
of
musketry
then
a
voice
boomed
down
haul
up
your
ports
and
run
out
your
guns
at
that
the
men
beside
the
guns
sprang
up
with
running
and
calling
and
the
ports
flew
open
and
the
sounds
from
without
became
suddenly
louder
and
clearer
on
the
one
hand
were
boys
handing
up
filled
on
the
other
were
gunners
with
linstocks
ready
and
powder
for
the
priming
then
ho
master
gunner
a
great
voice
roared
withhold
your
fire
the
boats
are
under
the
guns
and
too
near
for
a
fair
shot
it
was
such
a
moment
as
a
man
remembers
always
for
there
was
the
smoke
of
powder
in
the
air
with
a
din
of
splashing
and
cursing
and
overhead
a
great
hubbub
then
silence
save
for
the
quick
beat
of
oars
see
see
cried
the
men
there
go
their
boats
splintered
and
all
but
sunk
and
see
there
go
ours
to
your
oars
lads
to
your
oars
ere
their
ship
hath
time
to
flee
see
there
they
go
yea
and
there
go
we
the
old
one
had
made
his
last
blunder
he
had
come
by
night
thinking
to
board
a
peaceful
merchantman
laden
with
a
rich
cargo
and
had
found
himself
at
the
head
of
his
score
of
men
on
the
deck
of
a
to
all
those
below
but
most
of
all
to
philip
marsham
chained
in
the
gun
room
it
was
a
blind
confusing
affair
but
the
sounds
told
the
story
and
though
darkness
hid
the
blood
that
was
spilled
there
was
no
mistaking
the
cries
for
quarter
and
the
shrieks
of
agony
nor
was
there
need
for
haste
to
reach
the
rose
of
devon
since
the
men
left
as
keepers
of
the
ship
were
too
few
to
make
sail
captain
charles
winterton
of
the
king
navy
himself
boarded
the
dark
frigate
by
starlight
and
a
capital
lark
he
found
it
for
behind
his
stern
mien
was
a
lively
taste
for
such
adventure
with
lusty
shouting
he
swept
the
handful
of
men
from
her
deck
and
having
put
a
prize
crew
and
his
lieutenant
in
charge
of
her
he
brought
back
a
few
more
prisoners
to
join
company
with
the
luckless
boarders
he
had
sent
down
to
be
locked
in
irons
below
they
were
sad
and
angry
gentlemen
for
there
are
those
to
whom
the
laughter
of
a
hundred
sailors
is
worse
than
death
by
the
sword
the
first
of
them
all
to
enter
the
gun
room
was
tom
jordan
his
cheek
was
gashed
and
his
hair
was
singed
and
blood
smeared
his
shirt
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
one
arm
hung
limp
and
broken
but
though
he
was
in
great
pain
he
smiled
and
when
they
led
him
into
the
gun
room
and
he
saw
philip
marsham
with
bolts
on
wrists
and
ankles
he
laughed
aloud
the
fellow
was
a
very
mark
and
pattern
of
a
scoundrel
but
he
had
the
courage
and
spirit
of
a
hero
and
had
he
first
gone
to
sea
under
another
king
than
james
or
charles
he
might
in
some
overwhelming
danger
have
saved
england
great
admirals
are
made
of
such
timber
bold
resolute
utterly
dauntless
and
any
bold
man
might
have
fallen
into
the
same
trap
that
had
caught
tom
jordan
nay
had
nothing
warned
captain
winterton
or
aroused
his
suspicions
there
was
a
fighting
chance
for
tom
jordan
to
have
taken
his
ship
from
him
even
so
but
tom
jordan
had
gone
to
sea
in
the
days
when
the
navy
was
going
to
the
dogs
and
like
many
another
lad
of
spirit
who
left
the
king
service
to
join
the
pirates
he
had
adventured
with
the
algerians
before
he
led
the
gentlemen
of
bideford
and
at
last
hazarding
a
final
effort
to
retrieve
his
luck
he
had
unwittingly
thrust
his
head
into
the
halter
yet
though
they
had
broken
his
body
they
had
failed
to
touch
his
courage
despite
his
pain
he
could
smile
and
even
laugh
turning
his
great
grief
into
a
jest
he
cried
holla
o
bravest
of
boatswains
this
is
a
joy
i
had
not
looked
for
it
seems
that
if
hang
i
must
i
shall
not
hang
alone
and
laughing
again
right
merrily
he
swooned
away
which
captain
charles
winterton
having
himself
come
down
with
the
others
to
see
them
all
shackled
watched
with
quiet
interest
they
brought
down
the
carpenter
who
was
shaking
like
a
man
with
an
ague
and
his
beard
waggled
as
he
shook
they
brought
down
martin
barwick
whose
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
and
his
hand
rubbed
his
throat
for
it
itched
in
a
prophetic
manner
then
came
harry
malcolm
who
stopped
before
phil
and
spat
at
him
and
cursed
him
and
paul
craig
who
had
neither
eye
nor
thought
for
any
one
besides
himself
and
a
dozen
others
of
whom
there
was
not
one
that
failed
to
revile
at
their
erstwhile
boatswain
a
hapless
time
of
it
philip
marsham
had
among
them
but
it
added
little
to
his
great
burden
of
misery
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
did
reviling
content
them
for
toward
morning
when
the
others
were
dozing
harry
malcolm
whom
they
had
locked
to
a
longer
chain
crawled
over
to
where
phil
lay
and
very
craftily
tried
to
kill
him
with
bare
hands
the
guard
cried
out
but
instead
of
stopping
the
man
redoubled
his
efforts
to
throttle
the
lad
whom
he
had
seized
from
behind
when
he
was
asleep
whereupon
the
guard
struck
a
sharp
blow
with
the
butt
of
his
musket
and
when
the
corporal
had
come
running
and
had
felt
of
harry
malcolm
wrist
and
had
listened
for
his
heart
and
had
turned
him
over
on
his
back
he
cursed
the
guard
with
fluent
oaths
for
robbing
the
gallows

certain
of
his
majesty
seamen
and
had
occasioned
his
majesty
much
grief
and
concern
he
who
read
the
indictment
spoke
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
such
as
might
of
itself
make
a
man
think
of
his
sins
and
fear
judgment
but
they
were
already
cowed
and
fearful
save
only
the
old
one
who
still
held
his
head
high
and
very
scornfully
smiled
the
cook
bent
his
head
and
shivered
and
dared
not
look
the
jury
in
the
face
the
carpenter
wept
and
martin
barwick
was
like
a
man
struck
dumb
and
paul
craig
kept
working
his
mouth
and
biting
at
his
lips
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
for
who
would
not
seize
upon
the
chance
to
see
a
band
of
pirates
but
a
very
poor
show
the
pirates
made
save
the
old
one
for
though
they
had
talked
much
and
often
of
their
valour
and
had
represented
themselves
as
tall
fellows
who
feared
nothing
in
life
or
death
they
were
now
and
for
all
time
revealed
as
cowards
to
the
marrow
of
their
bones
quietly
and
expeditiously
the
officers
of
the
court
swore
their
first
witness
who
smelled
of
pitch
and
tar
and
bore
himself
in
such
wise
that
he
was
to
be
known
for
a
sailor
wherever
he
might
turn
to
their
questions
he
replied
with
easy
assurance
for
he
was
not
one
of
those
fellows
who
cope
with
great
gales
and
storms
at
sea
only
to
be
cowed
by
a
great
person
on
land
yea
sir
quoth
he
there
is
among
mariners
common
talk
of
a
band
of
sea
sharks
that
hath
long
resorted
to
his
majesty
port
of
bideford
yea
my
and
have
i
met
with
them
that
i
have
and
to
my
sorrow
this
month
two
years
i
was
master
in
a
likely
snow
the
prosperous
of
three
hundred
tons
which
fell
afoul
of
that
very
company
as
their
boasting
and
talk
discovered
to
us
who
took
our
ship
and
set
me
adrift
in
a
boat
with
seven
of
mine
own
men
whereby
god
being
merciful
unto
us
we
succeeded
after
many
hardships
in
winning
to
the
shore
of
ireland
whence
the
grace
of
bristol
bore
us
home
to
the
fate
of
the
others
in
our
company
in
faith
some
i
am
told
joined
themselves
with
that
same
band
of
sea
sharks
the
rest
were
slaughtered
out
of
nay
my
lord
the
night
was
black
and
my
sight
of
the
scoundrels
was
brief
i
much
misdoubt
if
i
should
know
them
again
come
come
quoth
his
lordship
tapping
the
papers
spread
on
his
great
table
look
at
these
prisoners
gathered
here
at
the
bar
and
tell
me
if
there
be
one
among
them
of
whom
you
can
say
man
was
there
this
man
did
thus
and
so
so
the
witness
came
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
pleased
to
be
seen
of
many
people
and
looked
them
over
one
and
all
but
at
the
end
of
his
looking
he
sadly
shook
his
head
nay
my
lord
the
night
was
dark
and
sight
was
uncertain
and
though
i
should
rejoice
none
more
than
i
to
see
a
pirate
hanged
i
am
most
loath
to
swear
away
the
life
of
an
innocent
man
there
is
no
man
here
of
whom
i
can
truly
say
i
have
seen
him
before
his
lordship
frowned
and
the
proctors
shook
their
heads
the
prisoners
sighed
and
breathed
more
freely
the
tale
was
at
an
end
and
bearing
away
with
him
his
smell
of
pitch
and
tar
the
fellow
returned
to
his
place
four
witnesses
were
then
summoned
one
after
another
and
told
tales
like
the
first
one
had
been
in
a
ship
that
was
seized
and
sunk
in
bristol
channel
the
second
had
received
a
gaping
wound
in
the
shoulder
off
david
head
and
had
known
no
more
until
he
found
himself
alone
on
the
deck
of
a
plundered
flyboat
the
third
had
fallen
into
evil
company
in
plymouth
which
beat
him
and
robbed
him
and
left
him
for
dead
and
from
the
talk
of
his
murderous
companions
he
had
learned
before
they
set
upon
him
that
they
were
certain
gentry
of
bideford
and
the
last
of
the
four
told
of
the
murderous
attack
of
a
boarding
party
which
had
taken
a
brig
and
tumbled
him
over
the
side
into
a
boat
yea
my
lord
he
cried
and
i
fear
to
think
upon
what
befell
our
captain
little
son
for
of
all
our
crew
only
three
men
were
left
alive
and
as
they
sailed
away
from
us
three
we
heard
the
boy
shrieking
pitifully
one
by
one
the
witnesses
wove
with
their
tales
a
black
net
of
wickedness
but
they
could
not
or
would
not
say
they
knew
this
prisoner
or
that
the
judge
frowned
darkly
from
his
bench
and
the
people
in
the
seats
opened
their
mouths
in
wonder
and
excitement
at
the
stories
of
robbery
and
murder
but
the
net
was
woven
loosely
and
without
knots
for
thus
far
there
had
been
no
one
to
pick
out
this
man
or
that
and
say
it
was
he
who
did
it
so
the
cook
and
the
carpenter
took
heart
and
the
colour
returned
to
martin
barwick
face
and
the
old
one
leaning
back
still
smiled
scornfully
yet
the
judge
and
the
advocates
seemed
in
no
way
discouraged
from
which
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
might
have
drawn
certain
conclusions
for
as
all
the
world
knows
judges
and
advocates
with
a
band
of
pirates
under
the
thumb
are
for
the
honour
of
the
law
set
upon
making
an
example
of
them
there
was
long
counselling
in
whispers
then
a
bustle
and
stir
and
an
officer
cried
loudly
come
make
haste
and
lead
her
in
a
murmur
passed
over
the
court
and
the
people
turned
their
heads
to
look
for
the
meaning
of
the
cry
then
a
door
opened
and
an
officer
appeared
leading
by
the
arm
a
very
old
woman
phil
marsham
felt
his
heart
leap
up
he
saw
martin
raise
his
hand
to
his
throat
with
a
look
of
horror
but
when
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
old
one
he
saw
to
his
wonder
that
the
old
one
was
smiling
as
calmly
as
before
truly
the
man
was
a
marvel
of
unconcern
and
a
very
cool
and
desperate
rascal
is
this
the
woman
quoth
my
lord
the
judge
who
raised
his
head
and
lifted
his
brows
to
see
her
the
better
yea
my
lord
hm
let
us
look
into
this
matter
there
was
silence
in
the
room
except
for
the
sound
of
shuffling
papers
this
woman
commonly
known
as
mother
taylor
is
to
be
hanged
this
day
sennight
i
believe
yea
my
lord
and
it
hath
been
suggested
that
if
she
can
lay
before
us
such
evidence
as
is
needful
she
will
be
commended
to
the
king
mercy
and
doubtless
reprieved
from
the
gallows
hath
all
this
been
made
plain
and
clear
to
her
yea
my
lord
hm
it
appears
by
these
papers
woman
that
keeping
a
house
to
which
rogues
of
all
descriptions
have
resorted
is
the
least
of
your
crimes
a
strange
cracked
old
voice
burst
shrilly
upon
the
still
court
is
a
lie
my
lord
alas
my
lord
that
wicked
lies
should
take
away
my
good
name
and
i
tottering
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
there
were
cries
of
silence
and
the
officer
at
the
old
woman
side
shook
her
by
the
arm
and
to
continue
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
you
have
disposed
of
all
manner
of
stolen
goods
and
have
prepared
slow
poisons
to
be
sold
at
a
great
price
and
have
stained
your
hands
with
murder
alas
my
lord
it
is
a
wicked
lie
they
shook
her
into
silence
but
her
lips
continued
to
move
and
as
she
stood
between
the
officers
her
sharp
little
eyes
ranged
about
the
court
there
was
further
counselling
among
the
proctors
then
one
cried
sharply
come
old
woman
remember
that
the
hangman
is
ready
to
don
his
gown
and
answer
me
truly
before
it
is
too
late
on
such
and
such
a
day
you
were
at
your
house
in
bideford
were
you
not
nay
sir
i
am
old
and
my
wits
are
not
all
they
were
once
and
i
can
not
remember
as
i
ought
come
now
on
such
a
day
did
not
a
certain
man
come
to
your
house
in
bideford
and
abide
there
the
night
it
may
be
it
may
be
for
one
who
keepeth
a
tavern
hath
many
guests
look
about
you
old
woman
and
tell
us
if
you
see
the
man
nay
good
sir
my
wits
wander
and
i
do
not
remember
as
i
used
as
philip
marsham
watched
her
hard
face
so
very
old
and
crafty
he
paid
little
heed
to
the
low
voices
of
the
proctors
and
the
judge
but
the
sharp
command
look
this
man
in
the
face
and
tell
us
if
you
have
ever
seen
him
before
came
to
the
erstwhile
boatswain
of
the
rose
of
devon
like
the
shock
of
cold
water
to
a
man
lying
asleep
they
led
her
before
tom
jordan
before
the
old
one
himself
and
the
two
looked
each
other
full
in
the
face
yet
neither
fluttered
an
eye
in
all
truth
they
were
a
cool
pair
it
had
taken
a
solomon
to
say
which
of
them
was
now
the
subtler
nay
my
lord
how
should
i
know
this
man
he
hath
the
look
of
an
honest
fellow
my
lord
but
i
never
saw
him
ere
this
thereupon
the
officers
exchanged
glances
and
the
proctors
whispered
together
they
led
her
before
martin
barwick
and
again
she
shook
her
old
white
head
nay
my
lord
i
know
him
not
but
martin
was
swallowing
hard
as
if
some
kind
of
pip
had
beset
him
and
this
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
court
down
the
line
of
accused
men
she
came
and
though
she
walked
in
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
she
said
of
each
in
her
shrill
quavering
old
voice
nay
my
lord
i
know
him
not
of
some
she
spoke
thus
in
all
truth
of
others
though
she
knew
it
would
cost
her
life
she
craftily
and
stoutly
lied
and
at
last
she
came
to
philip
marsham
whose
heart
chilled
when
he
met
the
sharp
eyes
that
had
looked
so
hard
into
his
own
in
bideford
long
before
nay
my
lord
he
is
a
handsome
blade
but
i
never
saw
him
ere
this
some
smiled
and
sniggered
but
the
old
woman
shrugged
and
lifted
her
brows
and
stood
before
the
court
wrinkled
and
bent
by
years
of
wickedness
say
what
you
will
of
her
sins
her
courage
and
loyalty
were
worthy
of
a
better
cause
in
despair
of
pinning
her
down
they
led
her
away
at
last
to
a
bench
and
there
she
sat
with
officers
to
guard
her
now
she
watched
one
man
and
now
she
watched
another
often
philip
marsham
felt
a
tremor
almost
of
fear
at
seeing
her
eyes
looking
hard
into
his
own
but
though
of
the
old
woman
the
court
had
made
nothing
the
exultation
that
showed
in
the
faces
of
some
of
the
prisoners
was
premature
for
the
lords
of
admiralty
had
other
shafts
to
their
bow
as
any
gentleman
of
fortune
might
have
known
they
would
again
there
was
a
stir
among
the
ushers
and
in
the
door
appeared
one
at
whose
coming
tom
jordan
ceased
to
smile
the
fellow
chin
sagged
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
he
ducked
to
his
lordship
as
if
some
one
had
pulled
a
string
and
when
they
called
on
him
to
give
the
court
his
name
he
cried
very
tremulously
yea
yea
joseph
kirk
an
it
please
you
my
lord
come
now
look
about
you
at
these
men
who
are
arraigned
for
piracy
are
there
any
there
whom
you
have
seen
elsewhere
yea
yea
that
there
be
there
and
there
and
there
ah
hm
men
you
have
seen
elsewhere
tell
us
who
they
are
and
his
lordship
smiled
dryly
it
is
not
to
count
against
me
my
lord
i
have
repented
yea
i
have
repented
not
undo
the
king
pardon
the
very
judge
on
the
bench
gave
a
grunt
as
in
disgust
of
the
abject
terror
the
fellow
showed
and
a
murmur
of
impatience
went
through
the
room
but
though
he
afforded
a
spectacle
for
contempt
they
reassured
him
and
urged
him
on
yea
yea
that
one
there
he
at
the
end
was
our
captain
and
tom
jordan
his
name
it
was
he
who
led
us
against
a
vast
number
of
prizes
which
yielded
rich
profit
it
was
he
and
harry
malcolm
why
harry
malcolm
is
not
here
huh
is
passing
strange
he
hath
so
often
stole
beside
them
i
had
thought
he
would
hang
beside
them
too
yea
and
as
i
was
saying
let
us
consider
yea
yea
it
was
he
and
harry
malcolm
who
contrived
the
plan
for
killing
captain
candle
and
taking
the
rose
of
devon
yea
they
called
me
apart
on
the
forecastle
and
tempted
me
to
sin
and
forced
me
with
many
threats
he
it
was
tom
jordan
was
on
his
feet
you
lie
in
your
throat
you
drunken
dog
it
was
you
who
struck
him
down
with
your
own
hand
nay
nay
i
did
him
no
harm
it
was
another
i
swear
it
was
another
it
seems
said
his
lordship
when
they
had
thrust
tom
jordan
back
in
his
seat
and
had
somewhat
abated
their
witness
terror
of
his
chief
it
seems
this
fellow
words
have
touched
a
sore
go
on
and
there
is
martin
barwick
nay
hold
him
nay
if
i
am
to
go
on
i
must
have
protection
and
there
paul
craig
and
there
our
boatswain
philip
marsham
and
so
he
continued
to
name
the
men
and
told
a
tale
of
shameful
acts
and
crimes
for
the
least
of
which
a
man
is
hanged
indeed
philip
marsham
himself
knew
enough
of
their
history
to
send
them
one
and
all
to
the
gallows
but
he
had
not
heard
a
tenth
part
of
the
story
of
piracy
and
robbery
and
murder
and
black
crimes
unfit
for
the
printed
page
that
this
renegade
pirate
told
to
the
full
court
of
admiralty
the
fellow
made
a
great
story
of
it
yet
kept
within
a
bowshot
of
the
truth
but
he
was
a
villain
of
mean
spirit
and
though
he
did
for
the
court
the
work
it
desired
he
bought
his
life
at
cost
of
whatever
honour
he
may
have
had
left
and
then
came
captain
charles
winterton
who
rose
bowing
in
stately
wise
to
his
lordship
and
with
a
composed
air
and
an
assured
voice
very
quietly
drew
tight
the
of
the
net
that
joe
kirk
had
knotted
in
his
grand
and
dignified
manner
he
bowed
now
and
then
to
his
lordship
and
to
the
proctors
who
asked
him
questions
with
a
deference
in
their
bearing
very
different
from
their
way
with
the
other
witnesses
yea
these
pirate
rogues
boarded
his
majesty
ship
sybil
and
killed
three
of
his
majesty
men
before
they
perceived
the
blunder
they
had
made
and
gave
themselves
how
many
lives
did
the
boarders
lose
probably
twelve
or
fourteen
several
bodies
fell
into
the
water
and
were
not
recovered
it
was
useless
to
hunt
for
them
my
lord
great
sharks
abound
in
those
yea
this
thomas
jordan
led
them
in
person
in
truth
there
is
little
distinction
between
them
in
the
matter
of
guilt
the
man
marsham
whom
the
previous
witness
named
a
boatswain
was
the
first
to
board
the
sybil
he
entered
the
great
cabin
by
way
of
the
stem
apparently
to
spy
out
the
situation
on
board
he
declared
himself
a
forced
man
who
had
run
away
from
the
pirates
who
could
say
the
situation
in
which
he
was
taken
was
such
certainly
as
to
incriminate
him
though
cause
for
sorrow
since
he
was
a
brave
lad
and
had
given
no
trouble
during
the
voyage
home
there
was
a
great
whispering
among
the
people
who
thought
it
was
a
shame
for
so
likely
a
lad
to
hang
with
a
pack
of
pirates
but
it
was
plain
by
now
to
the
greatest
dullard
among
those
unhappy
gentlemen
of
fortune
that
hang
they
must
and
for
philip
marsham
who
sat
as
white
as
death
from
the
shame
of
it
there
was
no
slightest
spark
of
hope
the
net
was
woven
and
knotted
and
drawn
and
the
end
of
it
all
was
at
hand
when
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
they
called
on
tom
jordan
for
his
defense
he
rose
and
said
alas
my
lord
the
ropes
are
laid
that
shall
hang
me
already
my
neck
aches
this
though
i
will
say
whatever
these
poor
men
have
done
it
is
i
that
compelled
them
into
it
and
i
my
lord
will
stand
to
answer
for
it
some
gave
one
defense
and
some
another
and
meanwhile
there
was
much
legal
talk
dry
and
long
and
hard
to
understand
and
so
at
last
they
called
on
philip
marsham
to
rise
and
speak
for
himself
if
he
had
anything
to
say
in
his
own
defense
he
rose
and
stood
before
them
very
white
of
face
and
though
his
voice
trembled
which
was
a
thing
to
be
expected
since
he
saw
before
him
a
shameful
death
he
told
them
his
true
story
beginning
with
the
day
he
sailed
from
bideford
very
much
as
i
have
told
it
here
but
when
they
asked
him
about
affairs
on
board
the
rose
of
devon
that
concerned
the
others
and
not
him
he
replied
that
each
man
must
tell
his
own
tale
and
that
though
he
swung
for
it
he
must
leave
the
others
to
answer
those
questions
for
themselves
come
quoth
his
lordship
leaning
forward
and
sharply
tapping
his
table
you
have
heard
the
question
asked
remember
young
man
that
you
stand
in
a
place
exceeding
slippery
it
shall
profit
you
nothing
to
hold
your
peace
my
lord
said
he
the
tale
hath
been
told
in
full
there
is
no
need
that
i
add
to
it
and
were
i
to
speak
further
i
should
but
carry
with
me
to
the
grave
the
thought
that
i
had
done
a
treacherous
thing
though
i
owe
these
men
for
nought
save
hard
usage
yet
have
i
eaten
their
bread
and
drunk
their
wine
and
i
will
not
despite
their
sins
help
to
hang
them
it
was
doubtless
very
wrong
for
him
to
reply
thus
as
any
moralist
will
point
out
since
it
is
a
man
duty
to
help
enforce
the
laws
by
bringing
criminals
to
justice
but
he
answered
according
to
his
own
conscience
and
after
the
craven
talk
of
joseph
kirk
the
lad
frank
and
honest
statement
pleased
perhaps
even
my
lord
the
judge
sitting
high
above
the
court
who
frowned
because
his
position
demanded
frowns
surely
loyalty
ranks
high
among
the
virtues
and
great
credit
is
due
to
a
keen
sense
of
personal
honour
but
there
then
came
from
his
talk
a
result
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
had
foreseen
up
sprang
tom
jordan
my
lord
he
cried
i
pray
thee
for
leave
to
speak
to
the
frowns
and
chidings
of
the
officers
who
forced
him
down
again
he
paid
no
heed
a
tumult
rose
in
the
room
for
they
had
hurled
the
old
one
back
and
clapped
hands
over
his
mouth
but
out
of
the
struggle
came
again
the
cry
my
lord
my
lord
and
his
lordship
calling
in
a
loud
voice
for
order
and
silence
scowled
and
gave
him
the
leave
he
asked
as
martin
had
said
long
before
tom
jordan
was
an
ugly
customer
when
his
temper
was
up
and
hot
but
no
man
to
nurse
a
grudge
i
thank
you
my
lord
said
he
the
while
smoothing
his
coat
which
had
wrinkled
sadly
in
the
scuffle
though
i
must
hang
i
desire
to
see
justice
done
it
lay
in
the
power
of
this
philip
marsham
to
have
added
to
the
tale
of
our
sins
and
the
sum
of
our
woes
wherefore
since
he
hath
had
the
spirit
to
refrain
from
doing
thus
why
my
lord
i
needs
must
say
that
he
hath
spoken
only
the
truth
he
was
a
forced
man
and
having
a
liking
for
him
since
he
is
a
lad
of
spirit
i
would
have
had
him
join
us
heart
and
soul
is
true
likewise
that
he
ran
away
from
our
ship
and
turned
his
hand
against
us
and
for
that
i
would
have
let
him
hang
with
these
other
tall
fellows
but
for
the
brave
spirit
he
hath
shown
but
as
for
yonder
swine
yea
thou
joe
kirk
quake
and
stare
he
hath
done
more
mean
filthy
tricks
to
earn
a
hanging
than
any
other
gentleman
of
fortune
i
believe
that
ever
sailed
the
seas
not
so
my
lord
joe
kirk
yelled
he
fears
me
for
my
knowledge
of
his
deeds
help
hold
him
hold
him
tom
jordan
swore
a
great
oath
and
joe
kirk
leaped
up
in
his
seat
white
and
shaking
and
cried
over
and
over
that
it
was
all
a
lie
and
there
was
a
merry
time
of
it
before
the
attendants
restored
peace
and
then
to
the
further
amazement
of
all
in
the
court
captain
charles
winterton
again
rose
if
i
may
add
a
word
my
lord
thank
you
my
lord
i
observed
that
when
the
prisoners
went
below
their
manner
toward
this
man
marsham
was
such
as
to
lend
a
certain
plausibility
to
his
story
they
took
in
short
so
vindictive
a
delight
in
his
misfortunes
that
even
then
it
seemed
not
beyond
reason
that
his
tale
was
true
and
that
he
had
indeed
left
them
without
leave
that
of
course
proves
nothing
with
regard
to
his
being
a
forced
man
but
it
is
a
matter
of
common
justice
to
say
that
in
consideration
of
all
that
i
have
seen
before
and
of
that
which
i
have
this
day
heard
i
believe
he
hath
told
the
truth
both
then
and
now
thank
you
my
lord
such
a
hullabaloo
of
talk
as
then
burst
forth
among
the
spectators
and
such
learned
argument
as
passed
between
the
proctors
and
the
lieutenant
of
admiralty
and
his
lordship
the
judge
surpass
imagination
some
quoted
the
latin
and
the
greek
while
others
of
less
learning
voiced
their
opinions
in
the
vulgar
tongue
so
that
all
in
all
there
was
enough
disputation
to
fuddle
the
wits
of
a
mere
layman
by
the
time
they
gave
the
case
to
the
jury
then
the
jury
weighing
all
that
had
been
said
put
together
its
twelve
heads
while
such
stillness
prevailed
in
the
court
that
a
man
could
hear
his
neighbor
breathing
it
seemed
to
those
whose
lives
were
at
stake
that
the
deliberations
took
as
many
hours
as
in
reality
they
took
minutes
there
are
times
when
every
grain
of
sand
in
the
glass
seems
to
loiter
in
falling
and
to
drift
through
the
air
like
thistledown
as
if
unwilling
to
come
to
rest
with
its
fellows
below
yet
the
sand
is
falling
as
fast
as
ever
though
a
man
whose
life
is
weighing
in
the
balance
can
scarcely
believe
it
so
at
last
the
jury
made
an
end
of
its
work
which
after
all
had
taken
little
enough
time
in
consideration
of
the
matter
they
must
decide
you
have
reached
with
due
and
faithful
care
a
verdict
in
this
matter
quoth
his
lordship
we
have
my
lord
you
will
then
declare
your
verdict
to
the
court
of
these
fourteen
prisoners
at
the
bar
of
justice
my
lord
we
find
one
and
all
guilty
of
the
felonies
and
piracies
that
are
charged
against
them
save
only
one
man
in
the
deathly
silence
that
fell
upon
the
room
the
name
sounded
forth
like
the
stroke
of
a
bell
we
acquit
my
lord
philip
marsham
there
and
then
philip
marsham
parted
company
with
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
his
hands
shook
when
he
rose
a
free
man
and
when
many
spoke
to
him
in
all
friendliness
he
could
find
no
voice
to
reply
never
again
did
he
see
their
faces
but
he
heard
long
afterward
of
how
a
week
from
the
day
of
their
trial
they
went
down
the
river
to
wapping
in
wherries
with
the
bright
sun
shining
on
the
ships
and
on
the
shore
where
a
great
throng
had
assembled
to
see
them
march
together
up
the
stairs
to
execution
dock
though
they
had
always
made
themselves
out
to
appear
great
and
fierce
men
yet
on
that
last
day
they
again
showed
themselves
cravens
at
heart
except
tom
jordan
the
old
one
stern
cold
shrewd
smiled
at
his
fellows
and
said
it
is
to
be
may
god
have
mercy
on
me
and
though
he
stood
with
the
black
cap
over
his
eyes
and
the
noose
round
his
neck
he
never
flinched
as
for
martin
barwick
his
face
grey
with
fear
he
strove
to
break
away
and
cried
out
in
english
and
in
spanish
and
called
on
the
virgin
sadly
though
had
he
fallen
from
the
teachings
of
the
church
and
little
did
his
cries
avail
him
he
came
at
the
last
to
the
end
he
had
feared
from
the
first
and
his
much
talk
of
hanging
was
thus
revealed
to
have
been
in
a
manner
prophecy
although
it
sprang
from
no
higher
oracle
than
his
own
cowardly
heart
one
told
philip
marsham
that
mother
taylor
was
hanged
another
said
they
let
her
go
to
die
a
natural
death
in
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
that
stood
by
the
crossroads
in
her
native
town
of
barnstable
either
tale
is
likely
enough
and
phil
never
learned
which
was
true
for
aught
i
know
to
the
contrary
she
may
have
found
an
elixir
of
life
as
good
as
the
one
discovered
by
the
famous
count
de
and
so
be
living
still
whatever
the
end
she
came
to
phil
marsham
was
far
away
when
they
determined
her
fate
for
the
day
he
stepped
out
in
the
streets
of
london
a
free
man
once
more
and
a
loyal
subject
of
the
king
he
took
the
road
to
the
distant
inn
where
he
was
of
a
mind
to
claim
fulfillment
of
nell
entick
promise
chapter
xxii
back
to
the
inn
if
this
were
a
mere
story
to
while
away
an
idle
hour
i
the
scribe
would
tie
neatly
every
knot
and
leave
no
irish
pennants
hanging
from
my
work
but
life
alas
is
no
pattern
drawn
to
scale
the
many
interweaving
threads
are
caught
up
in
strange
tangles
and
over
them
darkly
and
inscrutably
atropos
presides
who
can
not
recall
to
mind
names
and
faces
still
alive
with
the
friendship
of
a
few
weeks
or
months
a
friendship
pleasant
in
memory
a
friendship
that
promised
fruitful
years
but
that
was
lost
for
ever
when
a
boy
or
man
drifted
out
of
sight
for
one
reason
or
another
and
on
one
tide
or
another
of
the
projects
that
go
to
make
up
life
to
philip
marsham
tramping
again
the
high
roads
of
england
there
came
mingled
with
many
other
desires
a
longing
to
see
once
more
the
scottish
smith
who
had
wrought
the
dirk
that
had
tasted
blood
for
his
protection
in
those
dark
adventures
at
sea
but
when
he
came
to
the
smithy
beside
the
heath
he
found
it
open
and
empty
the
wind
blew
the
door
on
rusty
hinges
brown
leaves
had
drifted
in
and
lay
about
the
cold
forge
the
coals
were
dead
the
bellows
were
broken
and
the
lonely
man
who
had
wrought
iron
on
the
now
rusty
anvil
had
taken
his
tools
and
gone
the
day
was
still
young
for
the
wayfarer
starting
early
and
in
the
fullness
of
his
strength
had
this
day
covered
three
miles
in
the
time
that
one
had
taken
him
when
he
walked
that
road
before
so
he
left
the
smithy
and
pushed
on
across
the
heath
and
far
beyond
it
marking
each
familiar
farm
and
village
and
country
house
until
night
had
fallen
and
the
stars
had
come
out
when
he
laid
him
down
under
a
hedge
and
slept
he
was
thinking
when
he
fell
asleep
of
nell
entick
he
remembered
very
well
her
handsome
face
her
head
held
so
high
her
white
throat
and
bare
arms
he
was
going
back
to
the
inn
to
claim
fulfillment
of
her
promise
and
he
pictured
her
as
waiting
for
him
there
in
most
ways
he
was
a
bold
resolute
youth
who
had
seen
much
of
life
but
in
some
ways
nevertheless
he
was
a
lad
of
small
experience
and
if
he
thought
at
all
that
she
had
been
a
little
overbold
a
little
overwilling
he
thought
only
that
she
was
as
honestly
frank
as
he
waking
that
night
upon
his
bed
of
leaves
he
saw
far
away
on
a
hill
the
dancing
flames
of
a
campfire
concerning
which
he
greatly
wondered
for
having
been
long
out
of
england
he
had
small
knowledge
of
the
ups
and
downs
of
parliaments
and
kings
and
in
the
brief
time
since
his
return
of
which
he
had
spent
nearly
all
in
prison
he
had
heard
nothing
of
the
tumultuous
state
of
the
kingdom
save
a
few
words
dropped
here
or
there
while
he
was
passing
through
hamlets
and
villages
and
seen
nothing
thereof
save
such
show
of
arms
as
in
one
place
or
another
had
caught
his
eye
but
not
his
thought
although
he
knew
it
not
since
he
was
a
plain
lad
with
no
gift
of
he
lay
in
a
country
poised
on
the
brink
of
war
and
his
bed
was
made
in
the
field
where
a
great
battle
was
to
be
fought
he
went
on
at
daylight
and
going
through
a
village
at
high
noon
saw
a
preacher
in
clipped
hair
and
sober
garb
who
was
calling
on
the
people
to
be
valiant
and
of
good
courage
against
those
wicked
men
who
had
incited
riot
and
rebellion
among
the
roman
catholics
in
ireland
whereby
the
king
might
find
pretext
for
raising
a
vast
army
to
devastate
and
enslave
england
sorely
perplexed
by
this
talk
of
which
he
understood
little
phil
besought
a
sneering
young
fellow
who
stood
at
no
great
distance
for
an
explanation
to
which
the
fellow
replied
that
it
was
talk
for
them
that
wore
short
hair
and
long
ears
and
that
unless
a
man
kept
watch
upon
his
wits
his
own
ears
would
grow
as
long
from
hearing
it
as
those
of
any
roundhead
ass
in
the
country
at
this
phil
took
umbrage
but
the
fellow
cried
nay
that
he
would
fight
no
such
keen
blade
who
was
it
seemed
a
better
man
than
he
looked
and
with
a
laugh
he
waved
the
matter
off
and
strolled
away
so
to
the
inn
phil
came
in
due
time
having
meditated
much
meanwhile
on
the
talk
of
the
king
and
war
and
the
rights
of
parliament
which
was
in
the
mouths
and
ears
of
all
men
but
he
put
such
things
out
of
his
mind
when
at
last
he
saw
the
inn
for
the
moment
was
at
hand
when
his
dreams
should
come
true
and
he
should
find
waiting
for
him
the
nell
entick
he
remembered
from
long
ago
surely
a
lad
of
enterprise
who
had
ventured
the
world
over
with
pirates
could
find
in
any
english
village
something
to
which
he
could
turn
his
hand
indeed
who
knew
but
some
day
he
might
keep
the
inn
himself
or
do
better
who
knew
he
remembered
little
grimsby
and
drew
a
long
breath
caught
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
that
set
the
blood
drumming
in
his
ears
he
strode
into
the
house
and
boldly
stepping
up
to
the
public
bar
called
loudly
holla
i
say
i
would
have
speech
of
mistress
nell
entick
from
a
tall
settle
in
the
corner
where
he
sat
taking
tobacco
there
rose
a
huge
man
with
red
and
angry
face
who
in
the
devil
name
art
thou
he
roared
that
comes
ranting
into
an
honest
house
and
bawls
out
thus
the
name
of
mistress
nell
entick
there
were
as
usual
a
couple
of
countrymen
sitting
with
pots
of
ale
who
reared
their
heads
in
vast
amazement
and
in
the
noisy
kitchen
down
the
passage
a
perceptible
hush
followed
the
loud
words
the
house
seemed
to
pause
and
listen
the
countrymen
set
down
their
pots
there
was
a
sound
of
creaking
hinges
and
of
lightly
falling
feet
very
coolly
smiling
slightly
philip
marsham
met
the
eyes
of
the
big
man
it
seems
said
he
thou
art
riding
for
another
fall
a
look
of
recognition
at
first
incredulous
then
profoundly
displeased
dawned
on
the
red
face
and
even
greater
anger
followed
thou
banging
basting
broiling
brogger
he
thundered
thou
filthy
villain
out
the
door
begone
it
seems
jamie
barwick
that
thy
wits
are
struck
with
years
have
care
thy
brother
is
already
on
the
road
to
wapping
they
have
signed
and
sealed
his
passage
the
fat
man
came
to
phil
with
the
slow
gait
and
the
head
of
a
surly
dog
he
thrust
his
red
face
close
to
phil
own
yea
it
is
thou
he
sneered
i
am
minded
to
beat
thee
and
bang
thee
till
thou
goest
skulking
under
the
hedges
for
cover
but
it
seems
thou
hast
good
news
what
is
this
talk
of
the
hangman
budget
it
is
true
by
now
thine
excellent
brother
hath
in
all
likelihood
donned
the
black
cap
and
danced
on
air
as
for
beating
and
banging
scratch
thy
head
and
agitate
thy
memory
and
consider
if
i
have
given
thee
reason
to
hope
for
quietness
and
submission
there
was
a
flicker
of
doubt
in
the
man
small
eyes
whereby
it
seemed
his
memory
served
him
well
and
what
meanest
thou
by
saying
thou
have
speech
of
mistress
nell
entick
he
asked
suspiciously
that
concerns
thee
not
ha
he
scowled
darkly
methinks
it
concerns
me
nearly
and
then
a
high
voice
cried
who
called
my
name
they
turned
and
phil
marsham
face
lighted
for
she
stood
in
the
door
she
was
not
so
fair
as
he
had
pictured
her
what
lad
memory
will
not
play
such
tricks
as
that
and
he
thought
that
when
he
had
taken
her
away
from
the
inn
she
need
never
again
wear
a
drabbled
gown
but
it
was
she
the
nell
entick
who
had
so
lightly
given
him
her
promise
and
kissed
him
as
he
fled
and
he
had
come
for
her
back
again
john
nay
john
was
not
thy
name
stay
no
it
hath
escaped
me
but
i
remember
well
thy
face
and
shall
i
bring
thee
ale
or
sack
we
have
some
rare
fine
sack
he
stared
at
her
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
had
told
him
right
i
have
come
he
said
to
claim
a
certain
promise
she
looked
bewildered
puzzled
then
laughed
loudly
silly
boy
she
cried
i
am
these
six
months
a
wife
a
wife
yea
and
mine
cried
barwick
come
begone
i
i
have
no
puppies
sniffling
at
her
heels
at
something
in
the
man
manner
the
full
truth
dawned
on
philip
marsham
i
see
and
you
have
taken
the
inn
yea
that
i
have
must
i
split
thy
head
to
let
in
knowledge
begone
she
laid
her
hand
on
barwick
wrist
the
lad
means
no
harm
she
whispered
come
it
is
folly
to
drive
trade
away
and
over
shoulder
she
cast
phil
such
a
glance
that
he
knew
maid
or
matron
she
would
philander
still
but
phil
had
seen
her
with
new
eyes
and
the
old
charm
was
broken
perhaps
if
tom
marsham
had
waited
a
year
before
he
leaped
into
marriage
i
had
had
no
story
to
tell
all
that
was
best
in
the
father
had
come
down
to
the
son
and
phil
turned
his
back
on
the
siren
with
the
bold
bright
eyes
he
turned
his
back
on
the
inn
too
and
all
the
dreams
he
had
built
around
it
a
boy
imaginings
raised
on
the
sands
of
a
moment
fancy
nay
he
turned
his
back
on
all
the
world
he
had
hitherto
known
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
rubbing
from
his
face
a
spider
web
of
sordidness
that
he
was
cutting
the
last
cord
that
bound
him
to
his
old
wild
life
stirred
by
a
new
and
daring
project
he
went
out
of
the
inn
and
turned
to
the
left
and
took
the
road
in
search
of
sir
john
bristol
chapter
xxiii
and
old
sir
john
sir
john
bristol
there
gentlemen
was
a
brave
honest
man
a
man
of
spirit
and
of
a
humour
if
you
crossed
him
if
you
toyed
with
him
his
mirth
was
rough
his
hand
was
hard
he
was
relentless
as
iron
but
for
a
man
who
stood
his
ground
and
fought
a
bold
fight
and
met
squarely
the
old
man
eyes
there
was
nothing
sir
john
would
not
do
after
all
his
weary
travels
by
land
and
sea
philip
marsham
had
at
last
come
back
to
find
a
man
whom
he
had
seen
but
once
and
for
a
brief
time
yet
in
that
man
he
had
such
complete
confidence
as
he
had
never
had
in
any
other
and
since
jamie
barwick
had
left
the
man
service
and
taken
the
inn
who
knew
striding
over
the
same
rolling
country
road
that
he
had
tramped
with
martin
long
before
and
coming
soon
to
the
park
he
skirted
it
and
pressed
on
keeping
meanwhile
his
eyes
and
wits
about
him
until
he
perceived
a
gate
and
a
porter
lodge
he
went
to
the
gate
and
finding
it
ajar
slipped
through
and
made
haste
up
a
long
avenue
with
overarching
trees
a
man
from
the
lodge
came
out
and
angrily
called
after
the
intruder
but
phil
never
looked
back
the
avenue
turned
to
the
left
and
he
saw
at
a
distance
the
great
house
he
was
of
no
mind
to
suffer
hindrance
or
delay
the
sunset
sky
threw
long
still
shadows
across
the
grass
and
countless
wandering
branches
of
ivy
lay
like
a
dark
drapery
upon
the
grey
walls
of
the
old
house
a
huge
dog
came
bounding
and
roaring
down
the
avenue
but
when
the
lad
smiled
without
fear
and
reached
a
friendly
hand
toward
him
the
beast
stopped
clamouring
and
came
quietly
to
heel
lights
shone
from
the
windows
and
softly
on
the
still
evening
air
the
thin
sweet
music
of
a
virginal
stole
over
the
broad
terraces
and
lawns
the
clamour
of
the
dog
it
seemed
had
attracted
the
attention
of
those
within
for
a
servant
met
the
stranger
in
the
door
he
stood
there
suspiciously
forbiddingly
and
with
a
cold
stare
searched
the
young
man
from
head
to
heel
i
would
have
speech
of
sir
john
bristol
said
phil
the
servant
frowned
nay
you
have
blundered
he
replied
haughtily
the
servants
hall
i
said
sir
john
sir
john
it
is
ahem
impossible
i
said
sir
john
the
servant
moved
as
if
to
shut
the
door
come
said
phil
quietly
enough
of
that
i
will
have
speech
of
sir
john
bristol
for
a
moment
the
servant
hesitated
then
from
within
a
great
voice
cried
come
cobden
what
afoot
in
haughty
disapproval
of
the
lad
without
the
servant
turned
his
back
but
to
the
man
within
he
spoke
with
deference
as
if
apologizing
yea
sir
john
the
fellow
is
insistent
but
i
shall
soon
have
him
off
go
cobden
leave
him
to
me
the
servant
moved
away
and
disappeared
the
virginalling
had
ceased
and
on
the
lawns
and
the
avenue
and
the
park
which
stretched
away
into
the
dark
valley
a
deep
silence
had
come
with
the
twilight
the
sun
had
set
and
the
long
shadows
across
the
grass
were
lost
in
the
greater
shadow
of
evening
as
the
world
without
had
grown
darker
the
lights
within
seemed
to
have
grown
brighter
come
fellow
come
into
the
hall
so
have
i
not
seen
thee
before
yea
sir
john
ha
i
can
remember
faces
aye
there
are
few
that
escape
me
let
us
consider
why
on
my
life
this
is
the
lad
that
gave
barwick
such
a
tumbling
that
the
fellow
walked
lame
for
a
month
speak
up
have
i
not
placed
thee
right
though
i
was
faint
for
want
of
food
i
was
quicker
on
my
feet
than
he
the
old
man
laughed
until
his
brave
curls
shook
in
faith
and
it
is
said
with
moderation
and
what
now
lad
what
hath
brought
thee
hither
since
barwick
hath
left
your
service
that
he
hath
that
he
hath
it
seemed
there
might
be
a
place
for
a
keeper
for
a
keeper
ha
ha
ha
nay
th
art
too
spirited
a
lad
to
waste
away
as
keeper
mark
my
word
lad
the
king
will
shortly
have
need
for
such
courageous
gallants
as
thou
unless
i
mistake
thy
spirit
we
shall
soon
see
thee
riding
among
the
foremost
when
we
chase
these
dogs
of
roundheads
into
the
king
kennels
and
slit
their
noses
and
prick
their
ears
as
a
warning
to
all
of
weak
mind
and
base
spirit
i
have
a
taste
for
such
sport
and
god
knows
i
am
the
king
man
good
say
i
sir
john
clear
eyes
searched
the
frank
eyes
of
the
lad
and
the
old
man
was
pleased
with
what
he
found
come
the
cook
shall
fill
thy
belly
and
cobden
shall
find
thee
a
bed
cobden
cobden
i
say
yea
sir
john
make
place
for
this
good
fellow
in
the
servants
hall
and
see
that
he
hath
all
that
he
can
eat
and
drink
yea
sir
john
but
stay
a
moment
thy
name
fellow
philip
marsham
philip
marsham
the
heavy
brows
knotted
and
sir
john
spoke
musingly
philip
marsham
i
once
knew
a
man
of
that
name
silence
fell
upon
the
hall
grey
cobden
stood
a
little
behind
his
master
and
when
phil
looked
past
sir
john
he
saw
standing
in
a
door
the
tall
quiet
girl
he
had
seen
with
the
old
knight
that
day
in
the
wood
so
long
since
doubtless
it
was
she
who
had
played
upon
the
virginal
her
dark
eyes
and
fine
dignity
wove
a
spell
around
the
lad
a
spell
of
the
magic
that
has
come
down
from
the
beginning
of
time
the
magic
that
is
always
young
take
such
spells
such
magic
as
lightly
as
you
please
yet
they
have
overturned
kingdoms
and
not
once
but
many
times
have
they
launched
a
thousand
ships
did
you
ever
hear
of
marsham
of
little
grimsby
sir
john
asked
and
he
watched
the
lad
very
closely
yea
and
what
have
you
heard
of
him
he
is
my
grandfather
so
the
old
knight
stepped
back
and
bent
his
brows
verily
he
said
i
believe
the
lad
hath
spoken
truth
go
cobden
there
is
no
place
in
the
hall
for
this
lad
the
servant
departed
and
the
girl
stepped
nearer
your
father
name
sir
john
said
my
father
name
was
thomas
marsham
doubtless
he
bred
you
to
the
sea
he
did
he
broke
the
hearts
of
his
father
and
his
mother
phil
stood
silent
in
the
hall
and
looked
sir
john
in
the
eye
since
there
seemed
to
be
no
reply
he
waited
for
the
knight
to
speak
again
tom
marsham
father
and
mother
are
dead
but
within
the
year
lad
they
stood
where
you
are
standing
now
it
was
the
last
time
i
saw
them
what
could
a
young
man
say
phil
marsham
remembered
well
the
one
time
he
had
himself
seen
them
who
knew
what
might
have
happened
had
he
spoken
but
the
chance
was
gone
and
for
ever
there
is
no
place
for
philip
marsham
in
my
servants
hall
said
sir
john
his
father
but
no
let
the
dead
lie
there
is
no
place
for
philip
marsham
in
my
servants
hall
under
my
roof
he
is
my
guest
chapter
xxiv
and
again
the
rose
of
devon
the
story
of
philip
marsham
and
of
sir
john
bristol
and
of
the
fortune
left
by
the
good
doctor
marsham
of
little
grimsby
how
it
came
to
his
grandson
and
was
lost
in
the
war
that
brought
ruin
to
many
a
noble
family
is
a
tale
that
may
some
day
be
worth
the
telling
of
that
i
make
no
promises
the
years
that
followed
were
wild
and
turbulent
but
during
their
passage
phil
chanced
upon
one
reminder
and
another
of
his
earlier
days
of
adventuring
he
saw
once
again
the
long
ranting
madman
who
had
carried
the
great
book
he
might
not
have
known
the
fellow
who
was
in
a
company
of
brownists
or
anabaptists
or
some
such
people
had
he
not
heard
him
crying
out
in
his
voice
like
a
cracked
trumpet
to
the
great
wonder
and
admiration
of
his
fellows
never
was
a
man
beset
with
such
diversity
of
thoughts
there
was
jacob
too
who
had
sneaked
away
like
a
rat
on
the
eve
of
the
day
when
tom
jordan
schemes
fell
about
his
ears
phil
once
came
upon
him
face
to
face
but
when
their
eyes
met
jacob
slipped
round
a
corner
and
was
gone
he
was
a
subtle
man
and
wise
and
of
no
intention
to
be
reminded
of
his
days
as
a
pirate
philip
marsham
went
to
the
war
with
sir
john
bristol
and
fought
for
the
king
and
rose
to
be
a
captain
and
with
the
story
of
philip
marsham
is
interwoven
inseparably
the
story
of
anne
bristol
and
of
her
father
sir
john
for
sir
john
bristol
died
at
the
second
battle
of
newbury
with
his
head
on
philip
marsham
knees
and
in
his
grief
at
losing
the
brave
knight
who
had
befriended
him
the
lad
prayed
god
for
vengeance
on
the
roundhead
armies
and
yet
though
his
grief
was
bitter
he
had
too
just
a
mind
to
see
only
one
side
of
a
great
war
once
when
they
sent
him
from
the
camp
on
a
secret
mission
the
enemy
ran
him
to
cover
and
he
escaped
them
only
by
doubling
back
and
hiding
in
the
garret
of
a
cottage
where
he
lay
high
under
the
thatch
and
watched
through
a
dusty
little
window
the
street
from
the
red
boar
inn
down
the
hill
to
the
distant
meadows
without
being
himself
seen
he
heard
far
away
a
murmur
as
of
droning
bees
minutes
passed
and
he
heard
the
drone
settle
into
a
hollow
rumble
from
which
there
emerged
after
a
time
the
remote
sound
of
rattling
drums
and
the
occasional
voices
of
shouting
men
then
of
a
sudden
there
broke
on
the
air
a
sound
as
of
distant
thunder
in
which
he
made
out
a
chorus
his
staff
and
rod
shall
comfort
me
his
mantle
shall
be
my
shield
my
brimming
cup
i
hold
in
fee
of
him
who
rules
the
battlefield
the
voices
of
the
singing
men
came
booming
over
the
meadows
they
were
deep
strong
voices
and
there
was
that
in
their
volume
and
fierce
earnestness
which
made
a
man
shiver
phil
heard
a
dog
barking
he
saw
a
woman
standing
in
the
door
of
a
cottage
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
rise
above
the
meadow
then
they
came
first
a
band
of
men
on
foot
in
steel
caps
with
their
firelocks
shouldered
swinging
out
in
long
firm
strides
then
a
little
group
of
kettledrums
hammering
away
in
a
fierce
rhythm
then
a
number
of
horsemen
with
never
a
glint
of
gold
on
their
bridles
and
never
a
curl
from
under
their
iron
helms
then
rank
behind
rank
a
solid
column
of
foot
that
flowed
along
the
dusty
road
over
hillock
and
hollow
dark
and
sombre
undulating
like
a
torpid
stream
of
something
thick
and
slow
that
mightily
forces
a
passage
over
every
obstacle
in
its
way
they
came
up
the
hill
turning
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
up
the
hill
and
over
it
and
away
to
the
north
where
king
charles
and
all
his
armies
lay
it
was
a
fearful
sight
for
they
were
stern
determined
men
there
was
no
gallant
flippancy
in
their
carriage
there
was
no
lordly
show
of
ribbands
and
linen
and
gold
and
silver
lace
they
frowned
as
they
marched
and
looked
about
them
little
they
bore
so
steadily
on
they
made
one
feel
they
were
men
of
tempered
metal
men
of
no
blood
and
no
flesh
men
with
no
love
for
the
brave
adventures
of
life
but
with
a
streak
of
iron
in
their
very
souls
philip
marsham
had
heard
the
men
of
the
rose
of
devon
go
into
battle
with
cries
and
shouting
and
laugh
when
they
killed
he
had
seen
old
sir
john
bristol
throw
back
his
head
proudly
and
jest
with
the
girls
of
the
towns
on
their
march
but
these
were
men
of
another
pattern
he
became
aware
as
he
watched
them
go
by
and
he
then
knew
the
meaning
of
fear
safely
hidden
though
he
was
behind
the
dirty
and
small
window
in
the
gable
for
had
one
man
of
those
thousands
found
him
there
it
would
have
ended
the
fighting
days
of
philip
marsham
he
became
aware
that
here
was
a
courage
so
stubborn
there
was
no
mastering
it
that
here
was
a
purposeful
strength
such
as
all
the
wild
blades
in
his
master
camp
could
never
match
their
faces
showed
it
the
marching
rhythm
of
the
column
was
alive
with
it
behind
the
first
regiments
of
infantry
horsemen
came
and
at
an
interval
in
the
ranks
of
the
cavalry
five
men
rode
together
the
eyes
of
one
who
led
the
four
by
a
span
or
two
were
bent
on
the
road
and
his
face
was
stern
and
strong
and
thoughtful
as
phil
watched
him
the
first
hesitating
surmisal
became
conviction
and
long
afterward
he
learned
that
he
had
been
right
from
his
gable
window
he
had
seen
oliver
cromwell
go
by
all
that
afternoon
the
column
streamed
on
and
in
the
early
darkness
philip
fell
asleep
to
the
sound
of
men
marching
in
the
morning
they
were
gone
and
he
went
on
his
way
and
fulfilled
his
mission
but
though
the
king
men
fought
with
a
gallantry
that
never
lessened
the
cause
of
the
king
was
lost
and
the
day
broke
when
philip
marsham
was
ready
to
turn
his
back
on
england
so
he
came
a
second
time
to
the
harbour
of
bideford
in
devon
and
had
it
in
his
mind
to
take
ship
for
some
distant
land
where
he
could
forget
the
years
of
his
youth
and
early
manhood
he
was
in
the
mood
then
to
envy
sir
john
bristol
and
all
the
gallant
company
that
had
died
on
the
fields
of
naseby
and
newbury
and
of
many
another
great
battle
for
he
was
the
king
man
and
great
houses
of
the
country
had
fallen
and
many
lords
and
gentlemen
whose
estates
had
gone
to
pay
the
cost
of
cromwell
wars
had
as
much
reason
as
he
and
more
to
wonder
at
the
sight
of
deep
water
whether
it
were
better
to
die
by
one
own
hand
or
to
seek
new
fortunes
beyond
the
sea
there
were
many
vessels
in
the
harbour
and
his
gaze
wandered
over
them
ships
and
pinks
and
ketches
and
a
single
galliot
from
the
low
countries
until
his
eyes
came
at
last
to
one
of
singularly
familiar
aspect
he
looked
at
her
a
long
time
then
strolled
down
to
the
quay
and
accosted
an
aged
man
who
was
warming
his
rheumatic
limbs
in
the
sun
what
ship
is
that
said
captain
marsham
which
lies
yonder
in
line
with
the
house
on
the
farther
shore
to
the
right
of
the
three
trees
the
aged
man
squinted
over
the
harbour
to
pick
up
the
bearings
his
questioner
had
given
him
and
cleared
his
throat
with
a
husky
cough
why
that
he
said
beës
the
frigate
they
call
rose
of
devon
the
rose
of
devon
nay
she
can
not
be
the
rose
of
devon
can
and
beës
why
does
look
so
queer
sir
not
the
rose
of
devon
art
addled
he
laughed
like
a
cackling
hen
aye
an
yon
her
master
the
master
turned
when
the
young
captain
accosted
him
and
replied
with
reasonable
civility
yea
the
rose
of
devon
captain
hosmer
at
your
service
sir
passage
yea
we
can
take
you
but
you
a
queer
sort
to
ask
passage
ere
you
know
whither
she
sails
is
it
murder
or
theft
neither
the
old
order
is
changing
and
i
would
go
abroad
to
the
colonies
they
tell
me
all
the
colonies
are
of
a
piece
with
these
roundheads
here
and
that
as
many
psalms
are
whined
in
boston
in
new
england
as
in
all
the
conventicles
in
london
he
laughed
in
good
humour
you
are
rash
said
he
were
i
of
the
other
side
your
words
might
cost
you
your
head
but
we
going
south
to
barbados
and
there
you
find
men
to
your
own
taste
captain
philip
marsham
wished
no
more
than
that
so
he
struck
a
bargain
for
passage
and
paid
with
gold
and
sailed
from
england
for
the
second
time
in
the
old
rose
of
devon

dark

by
