i
it
happened
in
the
seventies
in
winter
on
the
day
after
nicholas
s
day
there
was
a
fete
in
the
parish
and
the
innkeeper
vasili
andreevich
brekhunov
a
second
guild
merchant
being
a
church
elder
had
to
go
to
church
and
had
also
to
entertain
his
relatives
and
friends
at
home
but
when
the
last
of
them
had
gone
he
at
once
began
to
prepare
to
drive
over
to
see
a
neighbouring
proprietor
about
a
grove
which
he
had
been
bargaining
over
for
a
long
time
he
was
now
in
a
hurry
to
start
lest
buyers
from
the
town
might
forestall
him
in
making
a
profitable
purchase
the
youthful
landowner
was
asking
ten
thousand
rubles
for
the
grove
simply
because
vasili
andreevich
was
offering
seven
thousand
seven
thousand
was
however
only
a
third
of
its
real
value
vasili
andreevich
might
perhaps
have
got
it
down
to
his
own
price
for
the
woods
were
in
his
district
and
he
had
a
agreement
with
the
other
village
dealers
that
no
one
should
run
up
the
price
in
another
s
district
but
he
had
now
learnt
that
some
from
town
meant
to
bid
for
the
goryachkin
grove
and
he
resolved
to
go
at
once
and
get
the
matter
settled
so
as
soon
as
the
feast
was
over
he
took
seven
hundred
rubles
from
his
strong
box
added
to
them
two
thousand
three
hundred
rubles
of
church
money
he
had
in
his
keeping
so
as
to
make
up
the
sum
to
three
thousand
carefully
counted
the
notes
and
having
put
them
into
his
made
haste
to
start
nikita
the
only
one
of
vasili
andreevich
s
labourers
who
was
not
drunk
that
day
ran
to
harness
the
horse
nikita
though
an
habitual
drunkard
was
not
drunk
that
day
because
since
the
last
day
before
the
fast
when
he
had
drunk
his
coat
and
leather
boots
he
had
sworn
off
drink
and
had
kept
his
vow
for
two
months
and
was
still
keeping
it
despite
the
temptation
of
the
vodka
that
had
been
drunk
everywhere
during
the
first
two
days
of
the
feast
nikita
was
a
peasant
of
about
fifty
from
a
neighbouring
village
not
a
manager
as
the
peasants
said
of
him
meaning
that
he
was
not
the
thrifty
head
of
a
household
but
lived
most
of
his
time
away
from
home
as
a
labourer
he
was
valued
everywhere
for
his
industry
dexterity
and
strength
at
work
and
still
more
for
his
kindly
and
pleasant
temper
but
he
never
settled
down
anywhere
for
long
because
about
twice
a
year
or
even
oftener
he
had
a
drinking
bout
and
then
besides
spending
all
his
clothes
on
drink
he
became
turbulent
and
quarrelsome
vasili
andreevich
himself
had
turned
him
away
several
times
but
had
afterwards
taken
him
back
again
valuing
his
honesty
his
kindness
to
animals
and
especially
his
cheapness
vasili
andreevich
did
not
pay
nikita
the
eighty
rubles
a
year
such
a
man
was
worth
but
only
about
forty
which
he
gave
him
haphazard
in
small
sums
and
even
that
mostly
not
in
cash
but
in
goods
from
his
own
shop
and
at
high
prices
nikita
s
wife
martha
who
had
once
been
a
handsome
vigorous
woman
managed
the
homestead
with
the
help
of
her
son
and
two
daughters
and
did
not
urge
nikita
to
live
at
home
first
because
she
had
been
living
for
some
twenty
years
already
with
a
cooper
a
peasant
from
another
village
who
lodged
in
their
house
and
secondly
because
though
she
managed
her
husband
as
she
pleased
when
he
was
sober
she
feared
him
like
fire
when
he
was
drunk
once
when
he
had
got
drunk
at
home
nikita
probably
to
make
up
for
his
submissiveness
when
sober
broke
open
her
box
took
out
her
best
clothes
snatched
up
an
axe
and
chopped
all
her
undergarments
and
dresses
to
bits
all
the
wages
nikita
earned
went
to
his
wife
and
he
raised
no
objection
to
that
so
now
two
days
before
the
holiday
martha
had
been
twice
to
see
vasili
andreevich
and
had
got
from
him
wheat
flour
tea
sugar
and
a
quart
of
vodka
the
lot
costing
three
rubles
and
also
five
rubles
in
cash
for
which
she
thanked
him
as
for
a
special
favour
though
he
owed
nikita
at
least
twenty
rubles
what
agreement
did
we
ever
draw
up
with
you
said
vasili
andreevich
to
nikita
if
you
need
anything
take
it
you
will
work
it
off
i
m
not
like
others
to
keep
you
waiting
and
making
up
accounts
and
reckoning
fines
we
deal
you
serve
me
and
i
don
t
neglect
and
when
saying
this
vasili
andreevich
was
honestly
convinced
that
he
was
nikita
s
benefactor
and
he
knew
how
to
put
it
so
plausibly
that
all
those
who
depended
on
him
for
their
money
beginning
with
nikita
confirmed
him
in
the
conviction
that
he
was
their
benefactor
and
did
not
overreach
them
yes
i
understand
vasili
andreevich
you
know
that
i
serve
you
and
take
as
much
pains
as
i
would
for
my
own
father
i
understand
very
well
nikita
would
reply
he
was
quite
aware
that
vasili
andreevich
was
cheating
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
clear
up
his
accounts
with
him
or
explain
his
side
of
the
matter
and
that
as
long
as
he
had
nowhere
to
go
he
must
accept
what
he
could
get
now
having
heard
his
master
s
order
to
harness
he
went
as
usual
cheerfully
and
willingly
to
the
shed
stepping
briskly
and
easily
on
his
rather
feet
took
down
from
a
nail
the
heavy
tasselled
leather
bridle
and
jingling
the
rings
of
the
bit
went
to
the
closed
stable
where
the
horse
he
was
to
harness
was
standing
by
himself
what
feeling
lonely
feeling
lonely
little
silly
said
nikita
in
answer
to
the
low
whinny
with
which
he
was
greeted
by
the
bay
stallion
with
a
rather
slanting
crupper
who
stood
alone
in
the
shed
now
then
now
then
there
s
time
enough
let
me
water
you
first
he
went
on
speaking
to
the
horse
just
as
to
someone
who
understood
the
words
he
was
using
and
having
whisked
the
dusty
grooved
back
of
the
young
stallion
with
the
skirt
of
his
coat
he
put
a
bridle
on
his
handsome
head
straightened
his
ears
and
forelock
and
having
taken
off
his
halter
led
him
out
to
water
picking
his
way
out
of
the
stable
mukhorty
frisked
and
making
play
with
his
hind
leg
pretended
that
he
meant
to
kick
nikita
who
was
running
at
a
trot
beside
him
to
the
pump
now
then
now
then
you
rascal
nikita
called
out
well
knowing
how
carefully
mukhorty
threw
out
his
hind
leg
just
to
touch
his
greasy
sheepskin
coat
but
not
to
strike
him
a
trick
nikita
much
appreciated
after
a
drink
of
the
cold
water
the
horse
sighed
moving
his
strong
wet
lips
from
the
hairs
of
which
transparent
drops
fell
into
the
trough
then
standing
still
as
if
in
thought
he
suddenly
gave
a
loud
snort
if
you
don
t
want
any
more
you
needn
t
but
don
t
go
asking
for
any
later
said
nikita
quite
seriously
and
fully
explaining
his
conduct
to
mukhorty
then
he
ran
back
to
the
shed
pulling
the
playful
young
horse
who
wanted
to
gambol
all
over
the
yard
by
the
rein
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
yard
except
a
stranger
the
cook
s
husband
who
had
come
for
the
holiday
go
and
ask
which
sledge
is
to
be
harnessed
the
wide
one
or
the
small
one
there
s
a
good
fellow
the
cook
s
husband
went
into
the
house
which
stood
on
an
iron
foundation
and
was
and
soon
returned
saying
that
the
little
one
was
to
be
harnessed
by
that
time
nikita
had
put
the
collar
and
on
mukhorty
and
carrying
a
light
painted
in
one
hand
was
leading
the
horse
with
the
other
up
to
two
sledges
that
stood
in
the
shed
all
right
let
it
be
the
little
one
he
said
backing
the
intelligent
horse
which
all
the
time
kept
pretending
to
bite
him
into
the
shafts
and
with
the
aid
of
the
cook
s
husband
he
proceeded
to
harness
when
everything
was
nearly
ready
and
only
the
reins
had
to
be
adjusted
nikita
sent
the
other
man
to
the
shed
for
some
straw
and
to
the
barn
for
a
drugget
there
that
s
all
right
now
now
don
t
bristle
up
said
nikita
pressing
down
into
the
sledge
the
freshly
threshed
oat
straw
the
cook
s
husband
had
brought
and
now
let
s
spread
the
sacking
like
this
and
the
drugget
over
it
there
like
that
it
will
be
comfortable
sitting
he
went
on
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
and
tucking
the
drugget
all
round
over
the
straw
to
make
a
seat
thank
you
dear
man
things
always
go
quicker
with
two
working
at
it
he
added
and
gathering
up
the
leather
reins
fastened
together
by
a
brass
ring
nikita
took
the
driver
s
seat
and
started
the
impatient
horse
over
the
frozen
manure
which
lay
in
the
yard
towards
the
gate
uncle
nikita
i
say
uncle
uncle
a
voice
shouted
and
a
boy
in
a
black
sheepskin
coat
new
white
felt
boots
and
a
warm
cap
ran
hurriedly
out
of
the
house
into
the
yard
take
me
with
you
he
cried
fastening
up
his
coat
as
he
ran
all
right
come
along
darling
said
nikita
and
stopping
the
sledge
he
picked
up
the
master
s
pale
thin
little
son
radiant
with
joy
and
drove
out
into
the
road
it
was
past
two
o
clock
and
the
day
was
windy
dull
and
cold
with
more
than
twenty
degrees
fahrenheit
of
frost
half
the
sky
was
hidden
by
a
lowering
dark
cloud
in
the
yard
it
was
quiet
but
in
the
street
the
wind
was
felt
more
keenly
the
snow
swept
down
from
a
neighbouring
shed
and
whirled
about
in
the
corner
near
the
hardly
had
nikita
driven
out
of
the
yard
and
turned
the
horse
s
head
to
the
house
before
vasili
andreevich
emerged
from
the
high
porch
in
front
of
the
house
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
wearing
a
coat
tightly
girdled
low
at
his
waist
and
stepped
onto
the
snow
which
squeaked
under
the
leather
soles
of
his
felt
boots
and
stopped
taking
a
last
whiff
of
his
cigarette
he
threw
it
down
stepped
on
it
and
letting
the
smoke
escape
through
his
moustache
and
looking
askance
at
the
horse
that
was
coming
up
began
to
tuck
in
his
sheepskin
collar
on
both
sides
of
his
ruddy
face
except
for
the
moustache
so
that
his
breath
should
not
moisten
the
collar
see
now
the
young
scamp
is
there
already
he
exclaimed
when
he
saw
his
little
son
in
the
sledge
vasili
andreevich
was
excited
by
the
vodka
he
had
drunk
with
his
visitors
and
so
he
was
even
more
pleased
than
usual
with
everything
that
was
his
and
all
that
he
did
the
sight
of
his
son
whom
he
always
thought
of
as
his
heir
now
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
looked
at
him
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
showing
his
long
teeth
his
wife
pregnant
thin
and
pale
with
her
head
and
shoulders
wrapped
in
a
shawl
so
that
nothing
of
her
face
could
be
seen
but
her
eyes
stood
behind
him
in
the
vestibule
to
see
him
off
now
really
you
ought
to
take
nikita
with
you
she
said
timidly
stepping
out
from
the
doorway
vasili
andreevich
did
not
answer
her
words
evidently
annoyed
him
and
he
frowned
angrily
and
spat
you
have
money
on
you
she
continued
in
the
same
plaintive
voice
what
if
the
weather
gets
worse
do
take
him
for
goodness
sake
why
don
t
i
know
the
road
that
i
must
needs
take
a
guide
exclaimed
vasili
andreevich
uttering
every
word
very
distinctly
and
compressing
his
lips
unnaturally
as
he
usually
did
when
speaking
to
buyers
and
sellers
really
you
ought
to
take
him
i
beg
you
in
god
s
name
his
wife
repeated
wrapping
her
shawl
more
closely
round
her
head
there
she
sticks
to
it
like
a
leech
where
am
i
to
take
him
i
m
quite
ready
to
go
with
you
vasili
andreevich
said
nikita
cheerfully
but
they
must
feed
the
horses
while
i
am
away
he
added
turning
to
his
master
s
wife
i
ll
look
after
them
nikita
dear
i
ll
tell
simon
replied
the
mistress
well
vasili
andreevich

said
nikita
awaiting
a
decision
it
seems
i
must
humour
my
old
woman
but
if
you
re
coming
you
d
better
put
on
a
warmer
cloak
said
vasili
andreevich
smiling
again
as
he
winked
at
nikita
s
short
sheepskin
coat
which
was
torn
under
the
arms
and
at
the
back
was
greasy
and
out
of
shape
frayed
to
a
fringe
round
the
skirt
and
had
endured
many
things
in
its
lifetime
hey
dear
man
come
and
hold
the
horse
shouted
nikita
to
the
cook
s
husband
who
was
still
in
the
yard
no
i
will
myself
i
will
myself
shrieked
the
little
boy
pulling
his
hands
red
with
cold
out
of
his
pockets
and
seizing
the
cold
leather
reins
only
don
t
be
too
long
dressing
yourself
up
look
alive
shouted
vasili
andreevich
grinning
at
nikita
only
a
moment
father
vasili
andreevich
replied
nikita
and
running
quickly
with
his
inturned
toes
in
his
felt
boots
with
their
soles
patched
with
felt
he
hurried
across
the
yard
and
into
the
workmen
s
hut
arinushka
get
my
coat
down
from
the
stove
i
m
going
with
the
master
he
said
as
he
ran
into
the
hut
and
took
down
his
girdle
from
the
nail
on
which
it
hung
the
workmen
s
cook
who
had
had
a
sleep
after
dinner
and
was
now
getting
the
samovar
ready
for
her
husband
turned
cheerfully
to
nikita
and
infected
by
his
hurry
began
to
move
as
quickly
as
he
did
got
down
his
miserable
cloth
coat
from
the
stove
where
it
was
drying
and
began
hurriedly
shaking
it
out
and
smoothing
it
down
there
now
you
ll
have
a
chance
of
a
holiday
with
your
good
man
said
nikita
who
from
kindhearted
politeness
always
said
something
to
anyone
he
was
alone
with
then
drawing
his
worn
narrow
girdle
round
him
he
drew
in
his
breath
pulling
in
his
lean
stomach
still
more
and
girdled
himself
as
tightly
as
he
could
over
his
sheepskin
there
now
he
said
addressing
himself
no
longer
to
the
cook
but
the
girdle
as
he
tucked
the
ends
in
at
the
waist
now
you
won
t
come
undone
and
working
his
shoulders
up
and
down
to
free
his
arms
he
put
the
coat
over
his
sheepskin
arched
his
back
more
strongly
to
ease
his
arms
poked
himself
under
the
armpits
and
took
down
his
mittens
from
the
shelf
now
we
re
all
right
you
ought
to
wrap
your
feet
up
nikita
your
boots
are
very
nikita
stopped
as
if
he
had
suddenly
realized
this
yes
i
ought
to
but
they
ll
do
like
this
it
isn
t
far
and
he
ran
out
into
the
yard
won
t
you
be
cold
nikita
said
the
mistress
as
he
came
up
to
the
sledge
cold
no
i
m
quite
warm
answered
nikita
as
he
pushed
some
straw
up
to
the
forepart
of
the
sledge
so
that
it
should
cover
his
feet
and
stowed
away
the
whip
which
the
good
horse
would
not
need
at
the
bottom
of
the
sledge
vasili
andreevich
who
was
wearing
two
coats
one
over
the
other
was
already
in
the
sledge
his
broad
back
filling
nearly
its
whole
rounded
width
and
taking
the
reins
he
immediately
touched
the
horse
nikita
jumped
in
just
as
the
sledge
started
and
seated
himself
in
front
on
the
left
side
with
one
leg
hanging
over
the
edge
ii
the
good
stallion
took
the
sledge
along
at
a
brisk
pace
over
the
road
through
the
village
the
runners
squeaking
slightly
as
they
went
look
at
him
hanging
on
there
hand
me
the
whip
nikita
shouted
vasili
andreevich
evidently
enjoying
the
sight
of
his
heir
who
standing
on
the
runners
was
hanging
on
at
the
back
of
the
sledge
i
ll
give
it
you
be
off
to
mamma
you
dog
the
boy
jumped
down
the
horse
increased
his
amble
and
suddenly
changing
foot
broke
into
a
fast
trot
the
crosses
the
village
where
vasili
andreevich
lived
consisted
of
six
houses
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
blacksmith
s
hut
the
last
in
the
village
they
realized
that
the
wind
was
much
stronger
than
they
had
thought
the
road
could
hardly
be
seen
the
tracks
left
by
the
were
immediately
covered
by
snow
and
the
road
was
only
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
it
was
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
ground
there
was
a
swirl
of
snow
over
the
fields
and
the
line
where
sky
and
earth
met
could
not
be
seen
the
telyatin
forest
usually
clearly
visible
now
only
loomed
up
occasionally
and
dimly
through
the
driving
snowy
dust
the
wind
came
from
the
left
insistently
blowing
over
to
one
side
the
mane
on
mukhorty
s
sleek
neck
and
carrying
aside
even
his
fluffy
tail
which
was
tied
in
a
simple
knot
nikita
s
wide
as
he
sat
on
the
windy
side
pressed
close
to
his
cheek
and
nose
this
road
doesn
t
give
him
a
chance
it
s
too
snowy
said
vasili
andreevich
who
prided
himself
on
his
good
horse
i
once
drove
to
pashutino
with
him
in
half
an
what
asked
nikita
who
could
not
hear
on
account
of
his
collar
i
say
i
once
went
to
pashutino
in
half
an
hour
shouted
vasili
andreevich
it
goes
without
saying
that
he
s
a
good
horse
replied
nikita
they
were
silent
for
a
while
but
vasili
andreevich
wished
to
talk
well
did
you
tell
your
wife
not
to
give
the
cooper
any
vodka
he
began
in
the
same
loud
tone
quite
convinced
that
nikita
must
feel
flattered
to
be
talking
with
so
clever
and
important
a
person
as
himself
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
his
jest
that
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
the
remark
might
be
unpleasant
to
nikita
the
wind
again
prevented
nikita
s
hearing
his
master
s
words
vasili
andreevich
repeated
the
jest
about
the
cooper
in
his
loud
clear
voice
that
s
their
business
vasili
andreevich
i
don
t
pry
into
their
affairs
as
long
as
she
doesn
t
our
boy
god
be
with
that
s
so
said
vasili
andreevich
well
and
will
you
be
buying
a
horse
in
spring
he
went
on
changing
the
subject
yes
i
can
t
avoid
it
answered
nikita
turning
down
his
collar
and
leaning
back
towards
his
master
the
conversation
now
became
interesting
to
him
and
he
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
word
the
lad
s
growing
up
he
must
begin
to
plough
for
himself
but
till
now
we
ve
always
had
to
hire
someone
he
said
well
why
not
have
the
one
i
won
t
charge
much
for
it
shouted
vasili
andreevich
feeling
animated
and
consequently
starting
on
his
favourite
occupation
that
of
which
absorbed
all
his
mental
powers
or
you
might
let
me
have
fifteen
rubles
and
i
ll
buy
one
at
the
said
nikita
who
knew
that
the
horse
vasili
andreevich
wanted
to
sell
him
would
be
dear
at
seven
rubles
but
that
if
he
took
it
from
him
it
would
be
charged
at
and
then
he
would
be
unable
to
draw
any
money
for
half
a
year
it
s
a
good
horse
i
think
of
your
interest
as
of
my
own
according
to
conscience
brekhunov
isn
t
a
man
to
wrong
anyone
let
the
loss
be
mine
i
m
not
like
others
honestly
he
shouted
in
the
voice
in
which
he
hypnotized
his
customers
and
dealers
it
s
a
real
good
quite
so
said
nikita
with
a
sigh
and
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
listen
to
he
again
released
his
collar
which
immediately
covered
his
ear
and
face
they
drove
on
in
silence
for
about
half
an
hour
the
wind
blew
sharply
onto
nikita
s
side
and
arm
where
his
sheepskin
was
torn
he
huddled
up
and
breathed
into
the
collar
which
covered
his
mouth
and
was
not
wholly
cold
what
do
you
think
shall
we
go
through
karamyshevo
or
by
the
straight
road
asked
vasili
andreevich
the
road
through
karamyshevo
was
more
frequented
and
was
well
marked
with
a
double
row
of
high
stakes
the
straight
road
was
nearer
but
little
used
and
had
no
stakes
or
only
poor
ones
covered
with
snow
nikita
thought
awhile
though
karamyshevo
is
farther
it
is
better
going
he
said
but
by
the
straight
road
when
once
we
get
through
the
hollow
by
the
forest
it
s
good
going
sheltered
said
vasili
andreevich
who
wished
to
go
the
nearest
way
just
as
you
please
said
nikita
and
again
let
go
of
his
collar
vasili
andreevich
did
as
he
had
said
and
having
gone
about
half
a
verst
came
to
a
tall
oak
stake
which
had
a
few
dry
leaves
still
dangling
on
it
and
there
he
turned
to
the
left
on
turning
they
faced
directly
against
the
wind
and
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
vasili
andreevich
who
was
driving
inflated
his
cheeks
blowing
the
breath
out
through
his
moustache
nikita
dozed
so
they
went
on
in
silence
for
about
ten
minutes
suddenly
vasili
andreevich
began
saying
something
eh
what
asked
nikita
opening
his
eyes
vasili
andreevich
did
not
answer
but
bent
over
looking
behind
them
and
then
ahead
of
the
horse
the
sweat
had
curled
mukhorty
s
coat
between
his
legs
and
on
his
neck
he
went
at
a
walk
what
is
it
nikita
asked
again
what
is
it
what
is
it
vasili
andreevich
mimicked
him
angrily
there
are
no
stakes
to
be
seen
we
must
have
got
off
the
road
well
pull
up
then
and
i
ll
look
for
it
said
nikita
and
jumping
down
lightly
from
the
sledge
and
taking
the
whip
from
under
the
straw
he
went
off
to
the
left
from
his
own
side
of
the
sledge
the
snow
was
not
deep
that
year
so
that
it
was
possible
to
walk
anywhere
but
still
in
places
it
was
and
got
into
nikita
s
boots
he
went
about
feeling
the
ground
with
his
feet
and
the
whip
but
could
not
find
the
road
anywhere
well
how
is
it
asked
vasili
andreevich
when
nikita
came
back
to
the
sledge
there
is
no
road
this
side
i
must
go
to
the
other
side
and
try
there
said
nikita
there
s
something
there
in
front
go
and
have
a
nikita
went
to
what
had
appeared
dark
but
found
that
it
was
earth
which
the
wind
had
blown
from
the
bare
fields
of
winter
oats
and
had
strewn
over
the
snow
colouring
it
having
searched
to
the
right
also
he
returned
to
the
sledge
brushed
the
snow
from
his
coat
shook
it
out
of
his
boots
and
seated
himself
once
more
we
must
go
to
the
right
he
said
decidedly
the
wind
was
blowing
on
our
left
before
but
now
it
is
straight
in
my
face
drive
to
the
right
he
repeated
with
decision
vasili
andreevich
took
his
advice
and
turned
to
the
right
but
still
there
was
no
road
they
went
on
in
that
direction
for
some
time
the
wind
was
as
fierce
as
ever
and
it
was
snowing
lightly
it
seems
vasili
andreevich
that
we
have
gone
quite
astray
nikita
suddenly
remarked
as
if
it
were
a
pleasant
thing
what
is
that
he
added
pointing
to
some
potato
vines
that
showed
up
from
under
the
snow
vasili
andreevich
stopped
the
perspiring
horse
whose
deep
sides
were
heaving
heavily
what
is
it
why
we
are
on
the
zakharov
lands
see
where
we
ve
got
to
nonsense
retorted
vasili
andreevich
it
s
not
nonsense
vasili
andreevich
it
s
the
truth
replied
nikita
you
can
feel
that
the
sledge
is
going
over
a
and
there
are
the
heaps
of
vines
which
have
been
carted
here
it
s
the
zakharov
factory
dear
me
how
we
have
gone
astray
said
vasili
andreevich
what
are
we
to
do
now
we
must
go
straight
on
that
s
all
we
shall
come
out
somewhere
if
not
at
zakharova
then
at
the
proprietor
s
farm
said
nikita
vasili
andreevich
agreed
and
drove
as
nikita
had
indicated
so
they
went
on
for
a
considerable
time
at
times
they
came
onto
bare
fields
and
the
rattled
over
frozen
lumps
of
earth
sometimes
they
got
onto
a
field
or
a
fallow
field
on
which
they
could
see
stalks
of
wormwood
and
straws
sticking
up
through
the
snow
and
swaying
in
the
wind
sometimes
they
came
onto
deep
and
even
white
snow
above
which
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
snow
was
falling
from
above
and
sometimes
rose
from
below
the
horse
was
evidently
exhausted
his
hair
had
all
curled
up
from
sweat
and
was
covered
with
and
he
went
at
a
walk
suddenly
he
stumbled
and
sat
down
in
a
ditch
or
vasili
andreevich
wanted
to
stop
but
nikita
cried
to
him
why
stop
we
ve
got
in
and
must
get
out
hey
pet
hey
darling
gee
up
old
fellow
he
shouted
in
a
cheerful
tone
to
the
horse
jumping
out
of
the
sledge
and
himself
getting
stuck
in
the
ditch
the
horse
gave
a
start
and
quickly
climbed
out
onto
the
frozen
bank
it
was
evidently
a
ditch
that
had
been
dug
there
where
are
we
now
asked
vasili
andreevich
we
ll
soon
find
out
nikita
replied
go
on
we
ll
get
why
this
must
be
the
goryachkin
forest
said
vasili
andreevich
pointing
to
something
dark
that
appeared
amid
the
snow
in
front
of
them
we
ll
see
what
forest
it
is
when
we
get
there
said
nikita
he
saw
that
beside
the
black
thing
they
had
noticed
dry
oblong
were
fluttering
and
so
he
knew
it
was
not
a
forest
but
a
settlement
but
he
did
not
wish
to
say
so
and
in
fact
they
had
not
gone
yards
beyond
the
ditch
before
something
in
front
of
them
evidently
trees
showed
up
black
and
they
heard
a
new
and
melancholy
sound
nikita
had
guessed
right
it
was
not
a
wood
but
a
row
of
tall
willows
with
a
few
leaves
still
fluttering
on
them
here
and
there
they
had
evidently
been
planted
along
the
ditch
round
a
coming
up
to
the
willows
which
moaned
sadly
in
the
wind
the
horse
suddenly
planted
his
forelegs
above
the
height
of
the
sledge
drew
up
his
hind
legs
also
pulling
the
sledge
onto
higher
ground
and
turned
to
the
left
no
longer
sinking
up
to
his
knees
in
snow
they
were
back
on
a
road
well
here
we
are
but
heaven
only
knows
where
said
nikita
the
horse
kept
straight
along
the
road
through
the
drifted
snow
and
before
they
had
gone
another
hundred
yards
the
straight
line
of
the
dark
wattle
wall
of
a
barn
showed
up
black
before
them
its
roof
heavily
covered
with
snow
which
poured
down
from
it
after
passing
the
barn
the
road
turned
to
the
wind
and
they
drove
into
a
but
ahead
of
them
was
a
lane
with
houses
on
either
side
so
evidently
the
snow
had
been
blown
across
the
road
and
they
had
to
drive
through
the
drift
and
so
in
fact
it
was
having
driven
through
the
snow
they
came
out
into
a
street
at
the
end
house
of
the
village
some
frozen
clothes
hanging
on
a
line
shirts
one
red
and
one
white
trousers
and
a
petticoat
fluttered
wildly
in
the
wind
the
white
shirt
in
particular
struggled
desperately
waving
its
sleeves
about
there
now
either
a
lazy
woman
or
a
dead
one
has
not
taken
her
clothes
down
before
the
holiday
remarked
nikita
looking
at
the
fluttering
shirts
iii
at
the
entrance
to
the
street
the
wind
still
raged
and
the
road
was
thickly
covered
with
snow
but
well
within
the
village
it
was
calm
warm
and
cheerful
at
one
house
a
dog
was
barking
at
another
a
woman
covering
her
head
with
her
coat
came
running
from
somewhere
and
entered
the
door
of
a
hut
stopping
on
the
threshold
to
have
a
look
at
the
passing
sledge
in
the
middle
of
the
village
girls
could
be
heard
singing
here
in
the
village
there
seemed
to
be
less
wind
and
snow
and
the
frost
was
less
keen
why
this
is
grishkino
said
vasili
andreevich
so
it
is
responded
nikita
it
really
was
grishkino
which
meant
that
they
had
gone
too
far
to
the
left
and
had
travelled
some
six
miles
not
quite
in
the
direction
they
aimed
at
but
towards
their
destination
for
all
that
from
grishkino
to
goryachkin
was
about
another
four
miles
in
the
middle
of
the
village
they
almost
ran
into
a
tall
man
walking
down
the
middle
of
the
street
who
are
you
shouted
the
man
stopping
the
horse
and
recognizing
vasili
anereevich
he
immediately
took
hold
of
the
shaft
went
along
it
hand
over
hand
till
he
reached
the
sledge
and
placed
himself
on
the
driver
s
seat
he
was
isay
a
peasant
of
vasili
andreevich
s
acquaintance
and
well
known
as
the
principal
in
the
district
ah
vasili
andreevich
where
are
you
off
to
said
isay
enveloping
nikita
in
the
odour
of
the
vodka
he
had
drunk
we
were
going
to
and
look
where
you
ve
got
to
you
should
have
gone
through
should
have
but
didn
t
manage
it
said
vasili
andreevich
holding
in
the
horse
that
s
a
good
horse
said
isay
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
mukhorty
and
with
a
practised
hand
he
tightened
the
loosened
knot
high
in
the
horse
s
bushy
tail
are
you
going
to
stay
the
night
no
friend
i
must
get
your
business
must
be
pressing
and
who
is
this
ah
nikita
stepanych
who
else
replied
nikita
but
i
say
good
friend
how
are
we
to
avoid
going
astray
again
where
can
you
go
astray
here
turn
back
straight
down
the
street
and
then
when
you
come
out
keep
straight
on
don
t
take
to
the
left
you
will
come
out
onto
the
high
road
and
then
turn
to
the
and
where
do
we
turn
off
the
high
road
as
in
summer
or
the
winter
way
asked
nikita
the
winter
way
as
soon
as
you
turn
off
you
ll
see
some
bushes
and
opposite
them
there
is
a
a
large
oak
one
with
branches
and
that
s
the
vasili
andreevich
turned
the
horse
back
and
drove
through
the
outskirts
of
the
village
why
not
stay
the
night
isay
shouted
after
them
but
vasili
andreevich
did
not
answer
and
touched
up
the
horse
four
miles
of
good
road
two
of
which
lay
through
the
forest
seemed
easy
to
manage
especially
as
the
wind
was
apparently
quieter
and
the
snow
had
stopped
having
driven
along
the
trodden
village
street
darkened
here
and
there
by
fresh
manure
past
the
yard
where
the
clothes
hung
out
and
where
the
white
shirt
had
broken
loose
and
was
now
attached
only
by
one
frozen
sleeve
they
again
came
within
sound
of
the
weird
moan
of
the
willows
and
again
emerged
on
the
open
fields
the
storm
far
from
ceasing
seemed
to
have
grown
yet
stronger
the
road
was
completely
covered
with
drifting
snow
and
only
the
stakes
showed
that
they
had
not
lost
their
way
but
even
the
stakes
ahead
of
them
were
not
easy
to
see
since
the
wind
blew
in
their
faces
vasili
andreevich
screwed
up
his
eyes
bent
down
his
head
and
looked
out
for
the
but
trusted
mainly
to
the
horse
s
sagacity
letting
it
take
its
own
way
and
the
horse
really
did
not
lose
the
road
but
followed
its
windings
turning
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
and
sensing
it
under
his
feet
so
that
though
the
snow
fell
thicker
and
the
wind
strengthened
they
still
continued
to
see
now
to
the
left
and
now
to
the
right
of
them
so
they
travelled
on
for
about
ten
minutes
when
suddenly
through
the
slanting
screen
of
snow
something
black
showed
up
which
moved
in
front
of
the
horse
this
was
another
sledge
with
mukhorty
overtook
them
and
struck
his
hoofs
against
the
back
of
the
sledge
in
front
of
them
pass
on
hey
there
get
in
front
cried
voices
from
the
sledge
vasili
andreevich
swerved
aside
to
pass
the
other
sledge
in
it
sat
three
men
and
a
woman
evidently
visitors
returning
from
a
feast
one
peasant
was
whacking
the
croup
of
their
little
horse
with
a
long
switch
and
the
other
two
sitting
in
front
waved
their
arms
and
shouted
something
the
woman
completely
wrapped
up
and
covered
with
snow
sat
drowsing
and
bumping
at
the
back
who
are
you
shouted
vasili
andreevich
from
was
all
that
could
be
heard
i
say
where
are
you
from
from
one
of
the
peasants
shouted
with
all
his
might
but
still
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
who
they
were
get
along
keep
up
shouted
another
ceaselessly
beating
his
horse
with
the
switch
so
you
re
from
a
feast
it
seems
go
on
go
on
faster
simon
get
in
front
faster
the
wings
of
the
sledges
bumped
against
one
another
almost
got
jammed
but
managed
to
separate
and
the
peasants
sledge
began
to
fall
behind
their
shaggy
horse
all
covered
with
snow
breathed
heavily
under
the
low
and
evidently
using
the
last
of
its
strength
vainly
endeavoured
to
escape
from
the
switch
hobbling
with
its
short
legs
through
the
deep
snow
which
it
threw
up
under
itself
its
muzzle
with
the
nether
lip
drawn
up
like
that
of
a
fish
nostrils
distended
and
ears
pressed
back
from
fear
kept
up
for
a
few
seconds
near
nikita
s
shoulder
and
then
began
to
fall
behind
just
see
what
liquor
does
said
nikita
they
ve
tired
that
little
horse
to
death
what
pagans
for
a
few
minutes
they
heard
the
panting
of
the
tired
little
horse
and
the
drunken
shouting
of
the
peasants
then
the
panting
and
the
shouts
died
away
and
around
them
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
whistling
of
the
wind
in
their
ears
and
now
and
then
the
squeak
of
their
over
a
windswept
part
of
the
road
this
encounter
cheered
and
enlivened
vasili
andreevich
and
he
drove
on
more
boldly
without
examining
the
urging
on
the
horse
and
trusting
to
him
nikita
had
nothing
to
do
and
as
usual
in
such
circumstances
he
drowsed
making
up
for
much
sleepless
time
suddenly
the
horse
stopped
and
nikita
nearly
fell
forward
onto
his
nose
you
know
we
re
off
the
track
again
said
vasili
andreevich
how
s
that
why
there
are
no
to
be
seen
we
must
have
got
off
the
road
well
if
we
ve
lost
the
road
we
must
find
it
said
nikita
curtly
and
getting
out
and
stepping
lightly
on
his
feet
he
started
once
more
going
about
on
the
snow
he
walked
about
for
a
long
time
now
disappearing
and
now
reappearing
and
finally
he
came
back
there
is
no
road
here
there
may
be
farther
on
he
said
getting
into
the
sledge
it
was
already
growing
dark
the
had
not
increased
but
had
also
not
subsided
if
we
could
only
hear
those
peasants
said
vasili
andreevich
well
they
haven
t
caught
us
up
we
must
have
gone
far
astray
or
maybe
they
have
lost
their
way
where
are
we
to
go
then
asked
vasili
andreevich
why
we
must
let
the
horse
take
its
own
way
said
nikita
he
will
take
us
right
let
me
have
the
vasili
andreevich
gave
him
the
reins
the
more
willingly
because
his
hands
were
beginning
to
feel
frozen
in
his
thick
gloves
nikita
took
the
reins
but
only
held
them
trying
not
to
shake
them
and
rejoicing
at
his
favourite
s
sagacity
and
indeed
the
clever
horse
turning
first
one
ear
and
then
the
other
now
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
began
to
wheel
round
the
one
thing
he
can
t
do
is
to
talk
nikita
kept
saying
see
what
he
is
doing
go
on
go
on
you
know
best
that
s
it
that
s
it
the
wind
was
now
blowing
from
behind
and
it
felt
warmer
yes
he
s
clever
nikita
continued
admiring
the
horse
a
kirgiz
horse
is
strong
but
stupid
but
this
one
just
see
what
he
s
doing
with
his
ears
he
doesn
t
need
any
telegraph
he
can
scent
a
mile
before
another
had
passed
they
saw
something
dark
ahead
of
them
a
wood
or
a
village
and
stakes
again
appeared
to
the
right
they
had
evidently
come
out
onto
the
road
why
that
s
grishkino
again
nikita
suddenly
exclaimed
and
indeed
there
on
their
left
was
that
same
barn
with
the
snow
flying
from
it
and
farther
on
the
same
line
with
the
frozen
washing
shirts
and
trousers
which
still
fluttered
desperately
in
the
wind
again
they
drove
into
the
street
and
again
it
grew
quiet
warm
and
cheerful
and
again
they
could
see
the
street
and
hear
voices
and
songs
and
the
barking
of
a
dog
it
was
already
so
dark
that
there
were
lights
in
some
of
the
windows
through
the
village
vasili
andreevich
turned
the
horse
towards
a
large
brick
house
and
stopped
at
the
porch
nikita
went
to
the
lighted
window
in
the
rays
of
which
flying
glittered
and
knocked
at
it
with
his
whip
who
is
there
a
voice
replied
to
his
knock
from
kresty
the
brekhunovs
dear
fellow
answered
nikita
just
come
out
for
a
someone
moved
from
the
window
and
a
minute
or
two
later
there
was
the
sound
of
the
passage
door
as
it
came
unstuck
then
the
latch
of
the
outside
door
clicked
and
a
tall
peasant
with
a
sheepskin
coat
thrown
over
his
white
holiday
shirt
pushed
his
way
out
holding
the
door
firmly
against
the
wind
followed
by
a
lad
in
a
red
shirt
and
high
leather
boots
is
that
you
andreevich
asked
the
old
man
yes
friend

ve
gone
astray
said
vasili
andreevich
we
wanted
to
get
to
goryachkin
but
found
ourselves
here
we
went
a
second
time
but
lost
our
way
just
see
how
you
have
gone
astray
said
the
old
man
petrushka
go
and
open
the
gate
he
added
turning
to
the
lad
in
the
red
shirt
all
right
said
the
lad
in
a
cheerful
voice
and
ran
back
into
the
passage
but
we
re
not
staying
the
night
said
vasili
andreevich
where
will

go
in
the
night

to
but
i

said
vasili
andreevich
it
won
t
get

moon

rise
and
it
will
be
lighter
let
s
go
in
and
warm
ourselves
well
why
not
let
us
warm
ourselves
replied
nikita
who
was
stiff
with
cold
and
anxious
to
warm
his
frozen
limbs
vasili
andreevich
went
into
the
room
with
the
old
man
and
nikita
drove
through
the
gate
opened
for
him
by
petrushka
by
whose
advice
he
backed
the
horse
under
the
penthouse
the
ground
was
covered
with
manure
and
the
tall
bow
over
the
horse
s
head
caught
against
the
beam
the
hens
and
the
cock
had
already
settled
to
roost
there
and
clucked
peevishly
clinging
to
the
beam
with
their
claws
the
disturbed
sheep
shied
and
rushed
aside
trampling
the
frozen
manure
with
their
hooves
the
dog
yelped
desperately
with
fright
and
anger
and
then
burst
out
barking
like
a
puppy
at
the
stranger
nikita
talked
to
them
all
excused
himself
to
the
fowls
and
assured
them
that
he
would
not
disturb
them
again
rebuked
the
sheep
for
being
frightened
without
knowing
why
and
kept
soothing
the
dog
while
he
tied
up
the
horse
now
that
will
be
all
right
he
said
knocking
the
snow
off
his
clothes
just
hear
how
he
barks
he
added
turning
to
the
dog
be
quiet
stupid
be
quiet
you
are
only
troubling
yourself
for
nothing
we
re
not
thieves
we
re
friends
and
these
are
it
s
said
the
three
domestic
counsellors
remarked
the
lad
and
with
his
strong
arms
he
pushed
under
the
the
sledge
that
had
remained
outside
why
counsellors
asked
nikita
that
s
what
is
printed
in
paulson
a
thief
creeps
to
a
house
the
dog
barks
that
means
be
on
your
guard
the
cock
crows
that
means
get
up
the
cat
licks
herself
that
means
a
welcome
guest
is
coming
get
ready
to
receive
him
said
the
lad
with
a
smile
petrushka
could
read
and
write
and
knew
paulson
s
primer
his
only
book
almost
by
heart
and
he
was
fond
of
quoting
sayings
from
it
that
he
thought
suited
the
occasion
especially
when
he
had
had
something
to
drink
as
that
s
so
said
nikita
you
must
be
chilled
through
and
through
said
petrushka
yes
i
am
rather
said
nikita
and
they
went
across
the
yard
and
the
passage
into
the
house
iv
the
household
to
which
vasili
andreevich
had
come
was
one
of
the
richest
in
the
village
the
family
had
five
allotments
besides
renting
other
land
they
had
six
horses
three
cows
two
calves
and
some
twenty
sheep
there
were
members
belonging
to
the
homestead
four
married
sons
six
grandchildren
one
of
whom
petrushka
was
married
two
three
orphans
and
four
with
their
babies
it
was
one
of
the
few
homesteads
that
remained
still
undivided
but
even
here
the
dull
internal
work
of
disintegration
which
would
inevitably
lead
to
separation
had
already
begun
starting
as
usual
among
the
women
two
sons
were
living
in
moscow
as
and
one
was
in
the
army
at
home
now
were
the
old
man
and
his
wife
their
second
son
who
managed
the
homestead
the
eldest
who
had
come
from
moscow
for
the
holiday
and
all
the
women
and
children
besides
these
members
of
the
family
there
was
a
visitor
a
neighbour
who
was
godfather
to
one
of
the
children
over
the
table
in
the
room
hung
a
lamp
with
a
shade
which
brightly
lit
up
the
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
some
refreshments
besides
illuminating
the
brick
walls
which
in
the
far
corner
were
hung
with
icons
on
both
sides
of
which
were
pictures
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
vasili
andreevich
in
a
black
sheepskin
coat
sucking
his
frozen
moustache
and
observing
the
room
and
the
people
around
him
with
his
prominent
eyes
with
him
sat
the
old
bald
master
of
the
house
in
a
white
homespun
shirt
and
next
him
the
son
home
from
moscow
for
the
holiday
a
man
with
a
sturdy
back
and
powerful
shoulders
and
clad
in
a
thin
print
shirt
then
the
second
son
also
who
acted
as
head
of
the
house
and
then
a
lean
peasant
the
neighbour
having
had
a
drink
of
vodka
and
something
to
eat
they
were
about
to
take
tea
and
the
samovar
standing
on
the
floor
beside
the
brick
oven
was
already
humming
the
children
could
be
seen
in
the
top
bunks
and
on
the
top
of
the
oven
a
woman
sat
on
a
lower
bunk
with
a
cradle
beside
her
the
old
housewife
her
face
covered
with
wrinkles
which
wrinkled
even
her
lips
was
waiting
on
vasili
andreevich
as
nikita
entered
the
house
she
was
offering
her
guest
a
small
tumbler
of
thick
glass
which
she
had
just
filled
with
vodka
don
t
refuse
vasili
andreevich
you
mustn
t
wish
us
a
merry
feast
drink
it
dear
she
said
the
sight
and
smell
of
vodka
especially
now
when
he
was
chilled
through
and
tired
out
much
disturbed
nikita
s
mind
he
frowned
and
having
shaken
the
snow
off
his
cap
and
coat
stopped
in
front
of
the
icons
as
if
not
seeing
anyone
crossed
himself
three
times
and
bowed
to
the
icons
then
turning
to
the
old
master
of
the
house
and
bowing
first
to
him
then
to
all
those
at
table
then
to
the
women
who
stood
by
the
oven
and
muttering
a
merry
holiday
he
began
taking
off
his
outer
things
without
looking
at
the
table
why
you
re
all
covered
with
old
fellow
said
the
eldest
brother
looking
at
nikita
s
face
eyes
and
beard
nikita
took
off
his
coat
shook
it
again
hung
it
up
beside
the
oven
and
came
up
to
the
table
he
too
was
offered
vodka
he
went
through
a
moment
of
painful
hesitation
and
nearly
took
up
the
glass
and
emptied
the
clear
fragrant
liquid
down
his
throat
but
he
glanced
at
vasili
andreevich
remembered
his
oath
and
the
boots
that
he
had
sold
for
drink
recalled
the
cooper
remembered
his
son
for
whom
he
had
promised
to
buy
a
horse
by
spring
sighed
and
declined
it
i
don
t
drink
thank
you
kindly
he
said
frowning
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
near
the
second
window
how
s
that
asked
the
eldest
brother
i
just
don
t
drink
replied
nikita
without
lifting
his
eyes
but
looking
askance
at
his
scanty
beard
and
moustache
and
getting
the
icicles
out
of
them
it
s
not
good
for
him
said
vasili
andreevich
munching
a
cracknel
after
emptying
his
glass
well
then
have
some
tea
said
the
kindly
old
hostess
you
must
be
chilled
through
good
soul
why
are
you
women
dawdling
so
with
the
samovar
it
is
ready
said
one
of
the
young
women
and
after
flicking
with
her
apron
the
top
of
the
samovar
which
was
now
boiling
over
she
carried
it
with
an
effort
to
the
table
raised
it
and
set
it
down
with
a
thud
meanwhile
vasili
andreevich
was
telling
how
he
had
lost
his
way
how
they
had
come
back
twice
to
this
same
village
and
how
they
had
gone
astray
and
had
met
some
drunken
peasants
their
hosts
were
surprised
explained
where
and
why
they
had
missed
their
way
said
who
the
tipsy
people
they
had
met
were
and
told
them
how
they
ought
to
go
a
little
child
could
find
the
way
to
molchanovka
from
here
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
take
the
right
turning
from
the
high
road
there
s
a
bush
you
can
see
just
there
but
you
didn
t
even
get
that
far
said
the
neighbour
you
d
better
stay
the
night
the
women
will
make
up
beds
for
you
said
the
old
woman
persuasively
you
could
go
on
in
the
morning
and
it
would
be
pleasanter
said
the
old
man
confirming
what
his
wife
had
said
i
can
t
friend
business
said
vasili
andreevich
lose
an
hour
and
you
can
t
catch
it
up
in
a
year
he
added
remembering
the
grove
and
the
dealers
who
might
snatch
that
deal
from
him
we
shall
get
there
shan
t
we
he
said
turning
to
nikita
nikita
did
not
answer
for
some
time
apparently
still
intent
on
thawing
out
his
beard
and
moustache
if
only
we
don
t
go
astray
again
he
replied
gloomily
he
was
gloomy
because
he
passionately
longed
for
some
vodka
and
the
only
thing
that
could
assuage
that
longing
was
tea
and
he
had
not
yet
been
offered
any
but
we
have
only
to
reach
the
turning
and
then
we
shan
t
go
wrong
the
road
will
be
through
the
forest
the
whole
way
said
vasili
andreevich
it
s
just
as
you
please
vasili
andreevich
if
we
re
to
go
let
us
go
said
nikita
taking
the
glass
of
tea
he
was
offered
we
ll
drink
our
tea
and
be
nikita
said
nothing
but
only
shook
his
head
and
carefully
pouring
some
tea
into
his
saucer
began
warming
his
hands
the
fingers
of
which
were
always
swollen
with
hard
work
over
the
steam
then
biting
off
a
tiny
bit
of
sugar
he
bowed
to
his
hosts
said
your
health
and
drew
in
the
steaming
liquid
if
somebody
would
see
us
as
far
as
the
turning
said
vasili
andreevich
well
we
can
do
that
said
the
eldest
son
petrushka
will
harness
and
go
that
far
with
well
then
put
in
the
horse
lad
and
i
shall
be
thankful
to
you
for
oh
what
for
dear
man
said
the
kindly
old
woman
we
are
heartily
glad
to
do
petrushka
go
and
put
in
the
mare
said
the
eldest
brother
all
right
replied
petrushka
with
a
smile
and
promptly
snatching
his
cap
down
from
a
nail
he
ran
away
to
harness
while
the
horse
was
being
harnessed
the
talk
returned
to
the
point
at
which
it
had
stopped
when
vasili
andreevich
drove
up
to
the
window
the
old
man
had
been
complaining
to
his
neighbour
the
village
elder
about
his
third
son
who
had
not
sent
him
anything
for
the
holiday
though
he
had
sent
a
french
shawl
to
his
wife
the
young
people
are
getting
out
of
hand
said
the
old
man
and
how
they
do
said
the
neighbour
there
s
no
managing
them
they
know
too
much
there
s
demochkin
now
who
broke
his
father
s
arm
it
s
all
from
being
too
clever
it
nikita
listened
watched
their
faces
and
evidently
would
have
liked
to
share
in
the
conversation
but
he
was
too
busy
drinking
his
tea
and
only
nodded
his
head
approvingly
he
emptied
one
tumbler
after
another
and
grew
warmer
and
warmer
and
more
and
more
comfortable
the
talk
continued
on
the
same
subject
for
a
long
time
the
harmfulness
of
a
household
dividing
up
and
it
was
clearly
not
an
abstract
discussion
but
concerned
the
question
of
a
separation
in
that
house
a
separation
demanded
by
the
second
son
who
sat
there
morosely
silent
it
was
evidently
a
sore
subject
and
absorbed
them
all
but
out
of
propriety
they
did
not
discuss
their
private
affairs
before
strangers
at
last
however
the
old
man
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
declared
that
he
would
not
consent
to
a
of
the
family
during
his
lifetime
that
his
house
was
prospering
thank
god
but
that
if
they
separated
they
would
all
have
to
go
begging
just
like
the
matveevs
said
the
neighbour
they
used
to
have
a
proper
house
but
now
they
ve
split
up
none
of
them
has
and
that
is
what
you
want
to
happen
to
us
said
the
old
man
turning
to
his
son
the
son
made
no
reply
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
the
silence
was
broken
by
petrushka
who
having
harnessed
the
horse
had
returned
to
the
hut
a
few
minutes
before
this
and
had
been
listening
all
the
time
with
a
smile
there
s
a
fable
about
that
in
paulson
he
said
a
father
gave
his
sons
a
broom
to
break
at
first
they
could
not
break
it
but
when
they
took
it
twig
by
twig
they
broke
it
easily
and
it
s
the
same
here
and
he
gave
a
broad
smile
i
m
ready
he
added
if
you
re
ready
let
s
go
said
vasili
andreevich
and
as
to
separating
don
t
you
allow
it
grandfather
you
got
everything
together
and
you
re
the
master
go
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
he
ll
say
how
things
should
be
he
carries
on
so
carries
on
so
the
old
man
continued
in
a
whining
tone
there
s
no
doing
anything
with
him
it
s
as
if
the
devil
possessed
nikita
having
meanwhile
finished
his
fifth
tumbler
of
tea
laid
it
on
its
side
instead
of
turning
it
upside
down
hoping
to
be
offered
a
sixth
glass
but
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
samovar
so
the
hostess
did
not
fill
it
up
for
him
besides
vasili
andreevich
was
putting
his
things
on
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
nikita
to
get
up
too
put
back
into
the
the
lump
of
sugar
he
had
nibbled
all
round
wipe
his
perspiring
face
with
the
skirt
of
his
sheepskin
and
go
to
put
on
his
overcoat
having
put
it
on
he
sighed
deeply
thanked
his
hosts
said
and
went
out
of
the
warm
bright
room
into
the
cold
dark
passage
through
which
the
wind
was
howling
and
where
snow
was
blowing
through
the
cracks
of
the
shaking
door
and
from
there
into
the
yard
petrushka
stood
in
his
sheepskin
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
by
his
horse
repeating
some
lines
from
paulson
s
primer
he
said
with
a
smile
storms
with
mist
the
sky
conceal
snowy
circles
wheeling
wild
now
like
savage
beast
twill
howl
and
now
tis
wailing
like
a
nikita
nodded
approvingly
as
he
arranged
the
reins
the
old
man
seeing
vasili
andreevich
off
brought
a
lantern
into
the
passage
to
show
him
a
light
but
it
was
blown
out
at
once
and
even
in
the
yard
it
was
evident
that
the
snowstorm
had
become
more
violent
well
this
is
weather
thought
vasili
andreevich
perhaps
we
may
not
get
there
after
all
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
business
besides
we
have
got
ready
our
host
s
horse
has
been
harnessed
and
we
ll
get
there
with
god
s
help
their
aged
host
also
thought
they
ought
not
to
go
but
he
had
already
tried
to
persuade
them
to
stay
and
had
not
been
listened
to
it
s
no
use
asking
them
again
maybe
my
age
makes
me
timid
they
ll
get
there
all
right
and
at
least
we
shall
get
to
bed
in
good
time
and
without
any
fuss
he
thought
petrushka
did
not
think
of
danger
he
knew
the
road
and
the
whole
district
so
well
and
the
lines
about
snowy
circles
wheeling
wild
described
what
was
happening
outside
so
aptly
that
it
cheered
him
up
nikita
did
not
wish
to
go
at
all
but
he
had
been
accustomed
not
to
have
his
own
way
and
to
serve
others
for
so
long
that
there
was
no
one
to
hinder
the
departing
travellers
v
vasili
andreevich
went
over
to
his
sledge
found
it
with
difficulty
in
the
darkness
climbed
in
and
took
the
reins
go
on
in
front
he
cried
petrushka
kneeling
in
his
low
sledge
started
his
horse
mukhorty
who
had
been
neighing
for
some
time
past
now
scenting
a
mare
ahead
of
him
started
after
her
and
they
drove
out
into
the
street
they
drove
again
through
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
along
the
same
road
past
the
yard
where
the
frozen
linen
had
hung
which
however
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
past
the
same
barn
which
was
now
snowed
up
almost
to
the
roof
and
from
which
the
snow
was
still
endlessly
pouring
past
the
same
dismally
moaning
whistling
and
swaying
willows
and
again
entered
into
the
sea
of
blustering
snow
raging
from
above
and
below
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
when
it
blew
from
the
side
and
the
travellers
steered
against
it
it
tilted
the
sledges
and
turned
the
horses
to
one
side
petrushka
drove
his
good
mare
in
front
at
a
brisk
trot
and
kept
shouting
lustily
mukhorty
pressed
after
her
after
travelling
so
for
about
ten
minutes
petrushka
turned
round
and
shouted
something
neither
vasili
andreevich
nor
nikita
could
hear
anything
because
of
the
wind
but
they
guessed
that
they
had
arrived
at
the
turning
in
fact
petrushka
had
turned
to
the
right
and
now
the
wind
that
had
blown
from
the
side
blew
straight
in
their
faces
and
through
the
snow
they
saw
something
dark
on
their
right
it
was
the
bush
at
the
turning
well
now
god
speed
you
thank
you
petrushka
storms
with
mist
the
sky
conceal
shouted
petrushka
as
he
disappeared
there
s
a
poet
for
you
muttered
vasili
andreevich
pulling
at
the
reins
yes
a
fine
lad
a
true
peasant
said
nikita
they
drove
on
nikita
wrapping
his
coat
closely
about
him
and
pressing
his
head
down
so
close
to
his
shoulders
that
his
short
beard
covered
his
throat
sat
silently
trying
not
to
lose
the
warmth
he
had
obtained
while
drinking
tea
in
the
house
before
him
he
saw
the
straight
lines
of
the
shafts
which
constantly
deceived
him
into
thinking
they
were
on
a
road
and
the
horse
s
swaying
crupper
with
his
knotted
tail
blown
to
one
side
and
farther
ahead
the
high
and
the
swaying
head
and
neck
of
the
horse
with
its
waving
mane
now
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
so
that
he
knew
they
were
still
on
a
road
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
be
concerned
about
vasili
andreevich
drove
on
leaving
it
to
the
horse
to
keep
to
the
road
but
mukhorty
though
he
had
had
a
in
the
village
ran
reluctantly
and
seemed
now
and
then
to
get
off
the
road
so
that
vasili
andreevich
had
repeatedly
to
correct
him
here
s
a
stake
to
the
right
and
another
and
here
s
a
third
vasili
andreevich
counted
and
here
in
front
is
the
forest
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
something
dark
in
front
of
him
but
what
had
seemed
to
him
a
forest
was
only
a
bush
they
passed
the
bush
and
drove
on
for
another
hundred
yards
but
there
was
no
fourth
nor
any
forest
we
must
reach
the
forest
soon
thought
vasili
andreevich
and
animated
by
the
vodka
and
the
tea
he
did
not
stop
but
shook
the
reins
and
the
good
obedient
horse
responded
now
ambling
now
slowly
trotting
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
sent
though
he
knew
that
he
was
not
going
the
right
way
ten
minutes
went
by
but
there
was
still
no
forest
there
now
we
must
be
astray
again
said
vasili
andreevich
pulling
up
nikita
silently
got
out
of
the
sledge
and
holding
his
coat
which
the
wind
now
wrapped
closely
about
him
and
now
almost
tore
off
started
to
feel
about
in
the
snow
going
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
three
or
four
times
he
was
completely
lost
to
sight
at
last
he
returned
and
took
the
reins
from
vasili
andreevich
s
hand
we
must
go
to
the
right
he
said
sternly
and
peremptorily
as
he
turned
the
horse
well
if
it
s
to
the
right
go
to
the
right
said
vasili
andreevich
yielding
up
the
reins
to
nikita
and
thrusting
his
freezing
hands
into
his
sleeves
nikita
did
not
reply
now
then
friend
stir
yourself
he
shouted
to
the
horse
but
in
spite
of
the
shake
of
the
reins
mukhorty
moved
only
at
a
walk
the
snow
in
places
was
up
to
his
knees
and
the
sledge
moved
by
fits
and
starts
with
his
every
movement
nikita
took
the
whip
that
hung
over
the
front
of
the
sledge
and
struck
him
once
the
good
horse
unused
to
the
whip
sprang
forward
and
moved
at
a
trot
but
immediately
fell
back
into
an
amble
and
then
to
a
walk
so
they
went
on
for
five
minutes
it
was
dark
and
the
snow
whirled
from
above
and
rose
from
below
so
that
sometimes
the
could
not
be
seen
at
times
the
sledge
seemed
to
stand
still
and
the
field
to
run
backwards
suddenly
the
horse
stopped
abruptly
evidently
aware
of
something
close
in
front
of
him
nikita
again
sprang
lightly
out
throwing
down
the
reins
and
went
ahead
to
see
what
had
brought
him
to
a
standstill
but
hardly
had
he
made
a
step
in
front
of
the
horse
before
his
feet
slipped
and
he
went
rolling
down
an
incline
whoa
whoa
whoa
he
said
to
himself
as
he
fell
and
he
tried
to
stop
his
fall
but
could
not
and
only
stopped
when
his
feet
plunged
into
a
thick
layer
of
snow
that
had
drifted
to
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
the
fringe
of
a
drift
of
snow
that
hung
on
the
edge
of
the
hollow
disturbed
by
nikita
s
fall
showered
down
on
him
and
got
inside
his
collar
what
a
thing
to
do
said
nikita
reproachfully
addressing
the
drift
and
the
hollow
and
shaking
the
snow
from
under
his
collar
nikita
hey
nikita
shouted
vasili
andreevich
from
above
but
nikita
did
not
reply
he
was
too
occupied
in
shaking
out
the
snow
and
searching
for
the
whip
he
had
dropped
when
rolling
down
the
incline
having
found
the
whip
he
tried
to
climb
straight
up
the
bank
where
he
had
rolled
down
but
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
he
kept
rolling
down
again
and
so
he
had
to
go
along
at
the
foot
of
the
hollow
to
find
a
way
up
about
seven
yards
farther
on
he
managed
with
difficulty
to
crawl
up
the
incline
on
all
fours
then
he
followed
the
edge
of
the
hollow
back
to
the
place
where
the
horse
should
have
been
he
could
not
see
either
horse
or
sledge
but
as
he
walked
against
the
wind
he
heard
vasili
andreevich
s
shouts
and
mukhorty
s
neighing
calling
him
i
m
coming
i
m
coming
what
are
you
cackling
for
he
muttered
only
when
he
had
come
up
to
the
sledge
could
he
make
out
the
horse
and
vasili
andreevich
standing
beside
it
and
looking
gigantic
where
the
devil
did
you
vanish
to
we
must
go
back
if
only
to
grishkino
he
began
reproaching
nikita
i
d
be
glad
to
get
back
vasili
andreevich
but
which
way
are
we
to
go
there
is
such
a
ravine
here
that
if
we
once
get
in
it
we
shan
t
get
out
again
i
got
stuck
so
fast
there
myself
that
i
could
hardly
get
what
shall
we
do
then
we
can
t
stay
here
we
must
go
somewhere
said
vasili
andreevich
nikita
said
nothing
he
seated
himself
in
the
sledge
with
his
back
to
the
wind
took
off
his
boots
shook
out
the
snow
that
had
got
into
them
and
taking
some
straw
from
the
bottom
of
the
sledge
carefully
plugged
with
it
a
hole
in
his
left
boot
vasili
andreevich
remained
silent
as
though
now
leaving
everything
to
nikita
having
put
his
boots
on
again
nikita
drew
his
feet
into
the
sledge
put
on
his
mittens
and
took
up
the
reins
and
directed
the
horse
along
the
side
of
the
ravine
but
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
the
horse
again
stopped
short
the
ravine
was
in
front
of
him
again
nikita
again
climbed
out
and
again
trudged
about
in
the
snow
he
did
this
for
a
considerable
time
and
at
last
appeared
from
the
opposite
side
to
that
from
which
he
had
started
vasili
andreevich
are
you
alive
he
called
out
here
replied
vasili
andreevich
well
what
now
i
can
t
make
anything
out
it
s
too
dark
there
s
nothing
but
ravines
we
must
drive
against
the
wind
they
set
off
once
more
again
nikita
went
stumbling
through
the
snow
again
he
fell
in
again
climbed
out
and
trudged
about
and
at
last
quite
out
of
breath
he
sat
down
beside
the
sledge
well
how
now
asked
vasili
andreevich
why
i
am
quite
worn
out
and
the
horse
won
t
then
what
s
to
be
done
why
wait
a
nikita
went
away
again
but
soon
returned
follow
me
he
said
going
in
front
of
the
horse
vasili
andreevich
no
longer
gave
orders
but
implicitly
did
what
nikita
told
him
here
follow
me
nikita
shouted
stepping
quickly
to
the
right
and
seizing
the
rein
he
led
mukhorty
down
towards
a
at
first
the
horse
held
back
then
he
jerked
forward
hoping
to
leap
the
drift
but
he
had
not
the
strength
and
sank
into
it
up
to
his
collar
get
out
nikita
called
to
vasili
andreevich
who
still
sat
in
the
sledge
and
taking
hold
of
one
shaft
he
moved
the
sledge
closer
to
the
horse
it
s
hard
brother
he
said
to
mukhorty
but
it
can
t
be
helped
make
an
effort
now
now
just
a
little
one
he
shouted
the
horse
gave
a
tug
then
another
but
failed
to
clear
himself
and
settled
down
again
as
if
considering
something
now
brother
this
won
t
do
nikita
admonished
him
now
once
more
again
nikita
tugged
at
the
shaft
on
his
side
and
vasili
andreevich
did
the
same
on
the
other
mukhorty
lifted
his
head
and
then
gave
a
sudden
jerk
that
s
it
that
s
it
cried
nikita
don
t
be
afraid
you
won
t
sink
one
plunge
another
and
a
third
and
at
last
mukhorty
was
out
of
the
and
stood
still
breathing
heavily
and
shaking
the
snow
off
himself
nikita
wished
to
lead
him
farther
but
vasili
andreevich
in
his
two
fur
coats
was
so
out
of
breath
that
he
could
not
walk
farther
and
dropped
into
the
sledge
let
me
get
my
breath
he
said
unfastening
the
kerchief
with
which
he
had
tied
the
collar
of
his
fur
coat
at
the
village
it
s
all
right
here
you
lie
there
said
nikita
i
will
lead
him
and
with
vasili
andreevich
in
the
sledge
he
led
the
horse
by
the
bridle
about
ten
paces
down
and
then
up
a
slight
rise
and
stopped
the
place
where
nikita
had
stopped
was
not
completely
in
the
hollow
where
the
snow
sweeping
down
from
the
hillocks
might
have
buried
them
altogether
but
still
it
was
partly
sheltered
from
the
wind
by
the
side
of
the
ravine
there
were
moments
when
the
wind
seemed
to
abate
a
little
but
that
did
not
last
long
and
as
if
to
make
up
for
that
respite
the
storm
swept
down
with
tenfold
vigour
and
tore
and
whirled
the
more
fiercely
such
a
gust
struck
them
at
the
moment
when
vasili
andreevich
having
recovered
his
breath
got
out
of
the
sledge
and
went
up
to
nikita
to
consult
him
as
to
what
they
should
do
they
both
bent
down
involuntarily
and
waited
till
the
violence
of
the
squall
should
have
passed
mukhorty
too
laid
back
his
ears
and
shook
his
head
discontentedly
as
soon
as
the
violence
of
the
blast
had
abated
a
little
nikita
took
off
his
mittens
stuck
them
into
his
belt
breathed
onto
his
hands
and
began
to
undo
the
straps
of
the
what
s
that
you
are
doing
there
asked
vasili
andreevich
unharnessing
what
else
is
there
to
do
i
have
no
strength
left
said
nikita
as
though
excusing
himself
can
t
we
drive
somewhere
no
we
can
t
we
shall
only
kill
the
horse
why
the
poor
beast
is
not
himself
now
said
nikita
pointing
to
the
horse
which
was
standing
submissively
waiting
for
what
might
come
with
his
steep
wet
sides
heaving
heavily
we
shall
have
to
stay
the
night
here
he
said
as
if
preparing
to
spend
the
night
at
an
inn
and
he
proceeded
to
unfasten
the
the
buckles
came
undone
but
shan
t
we
be
frozen
remarked
vasili
andreevich
well
if
we
are
we
can
t
help
it
said
nikita
vi
although
vasili
andreevich
felt
quite
warm
in
his
two
fur
coats
especially
after
struggling
in
the
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
back
on
realizing
that
he
must
really
spend
the
night
where
they
were
to
calm
himself
he
sat
down
in
the
sledge
and
got
out
his
cigarettes
and
matches
nikita
meanwhile
unharnessed
mukhorty
he
unstrapped
the
and
the
took
away
the
reins
loosened
the
and
removed
the
talking
to
him
all
the
time
to
encourage
him
now
come
out
come
out
he
said
leading
him
clear
of
the
shafts
now
we
ll
tie
you
up
here
and
i
ll
put
down
some
straw
and
take
off
your
bridle
when
you
ve
had
a
bite
you
ll
feel
more
but
mukhorty
was
restless
and
evidently
not
comforted
by
nikita
s
remarks
he
stepped
now
on
one
foot
and
now
on
another
and
pressed
close
against
the
sledge
turning
his
back
to
the
wind
and
rubbing
his
head
on
nikita
s
sleeve
then
as
if
not
to
pain
nikita
by
refusing
his
offer
of
the
straw
he
put
before
him
he
hurriedly
snatched
a
wisp
out
of
the
sledge
but
immediately
decided
that
it
was
now
no
time
to
think
of
straw
and
threw
it
down
and
the
wind
instantly
scattered
it
carried
it
away
and
covered
it
with
snow
now
we
will
set
up
a
signal
said
nikita
and
turning
the
front
of
the
sledge
to
the
wind
he
tied
the
shafts
together
with
a
strap
and
set
them
up
on
end
in
front
of
the
sledge
there
now
when
the
snow
covers
us
up
good
folk
will
see
the
shafts
and
dig
us
out
he
said
slapping
his
mittens
together
and
putting
them
on
that
s
what
the
old
folk
taught
us
vasili
andreevich
meanwhile
had
unfastened
his
coat
and
holding
its
skirts
up
for
shelter
struck
one
sulphur
match
after
another
on
the
steel
box
but
his
hands
trembled
and
one
match
after
another
either
did
not
kindle
or
was
blown
out
by
the
wind
just
as
he
was
lifting
it
to
the
cigarette
at
last
a
match
did
burn
up
and
its
flame
lit
up
for
a
moment
the
fur
of
his
coat
his
hand
with
the
gold
ring
on
the
bent
forefinger
and
the
that
stuck
out
from
under
the
drugget
the
cigarette
lighted
he
eagerly
took
a
whiff
or
two
inhaled
the
smoke
let
it
out
through
his
moustache
and
would
have
inhaled
again
but
the
wind
tore
off
the
burning
tobacco
and
whirled
it
away
as
it
had
done
the
straw
but
even
these
few
puffs
had
cheered
him
if
we
must
spend
the
night
here
we
must
he
said
with
decision
wait
a
bit
i
ll
arrange
a
flag
as
well
he
added
picking
up
the
kerchief
which
he
had
thrown
down
in
the
sledge
after
taking
it
from
round
his
collar
and
drawing
off
his
gloves
and
standing
up
on
the
front
of
the
sledge
and
stretching
himself
to
reach
the
strap
he
tied
the
handkerchief
to
it
with
a
tight
knot
the
kerchief
immediately
began
to
flutter
wildly
now
clinging
round
the
shaft
now
suddenly
streaming
out
stretching
and
flapping
just
see
what
a
fine
flag
said
vasili
andreevich
admiring
his
handiwork
and
letting
himself
down
into
the
sledge
we
should
be
warmer
together
but
there
s
not
room
enough
for
two
he
added
i
ll
find
a
place
said
nikita
but
i
must
cover
up
the
horse
first
he
sweated
so
poor
thing
let
go
he
added
drawing
the
drugget
from
under
vasili
andreevich
having
got
the
drugget
he
folded
it
in
two
and
after
taking
off
the
breechband
and
pad
covered
mukhorty
with
it
anyhow
it
will
be
warmer
silly
he
said
putting
back
the
breechband
and
the
pad
on
the
horse
over
the
drugget
then
having
finished
that
business
he
returned
to
the
sledge
and
addressing
vasili
andreevich
said
you
won
t
need
the
sackcloth
will
you
and
let
me
have
some
and
having
taken
these
things
from
under
vasili
andreevich
nikita
went
behind
the
sledge
dug
out
a
hole
for
himself
in
the
snow
put
straw
into
it
wrapped
his
coat
well
round
him
covered
himself
with
the
sackcloth
and
pulling
his
cap
well
down
seated
himself
on
the
straw
he
had
spread
and
leant
against
the
wooden
back
of
the
sledge
to
shelter
himself
from
the
wind
and
the
snow
vasili
andreevich
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
at
what
nikita
was
doing
as
in
general
he
disapproved
of
the
peasant
s
stupidity
and
lack
of
education
and
he
began
to
settle
himself
down
for
the
night
he
smoothed
the
remaining
straw
over
the
bottom
of
the
sledge
putting
more
of
it
under
his
side
then
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
sleeves
and
settled
down
sheltering
his
head
in
the
corner
of
the
sledge
from
the
wind
in
front
he
did
not
wish
to
sleep
he
lay
and
thought
thought
ever
of
the
one
thing
that
constituted
the
sole
aim
meaning
pleasure
and
pride
of
his
life
of
how
much
money
he
had
made
and
might
still
make
of
how
much
other
people
he
knew
had
made
and
possessed
and
of
how
those
others
had
made
and
were
making
it
and
how
he
like
them
might
still
make
much
more
the
purchase
of
the
goryachkin
grove
was
a
matter
of
immense
importance
to
him
by
that
one
deal
he
hoped
to
make
perhaps
ten
thousand
rubles
he
began
mentally
to
reckon
the
value
of
the
wood
he
had
inspected
in
autumn
and
on
five
acres
of
which
he
had
counted
all
the
trees
the
oaks
will
go
for
the
undergrowth
will
take
care
of
itself
and
there
ll
still
be
some
thirty
sazheens
of
left
on
each
desyatin
said
he
to
himself
that
means
there
will
be
at
least
two
hundred
and
rubles
worth
left
on
each
desyatin
desyatiins
means
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
tens
and
another
tens
and
then
fives
he
saw
that
it
came
out
to
more
than
twelve
thousand
rubles
but
could
not
reckon
it
up
exactly
without
a
but
i
won
t
give
ten
thousand
anyhow
i
ll
give
about
eight
thousand
with
a
deduction
on
account
of
the
glades
i
ll
grease
the
surveyor
s
palm
give
him
a
hundred
rubles
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
he
ll
reckon
that
there
are
some
five
desyatins
of
glade
to
be
deducted
and
he
ll
let
it
go
for
eight
thousand
three
thousand
cash
down
that
ll
move
him
no
fear
he
thought
and
he
pressed
his
with
his
forearm
god
only
knows
how
we
missed
the
turning
the
forest
ought
to
be
there
and
a
watchman
s
hut
and
dogs
barking
but
the
damned
things
don
t
bark
when
they
re
he
turned
his
collar
down
from
his
ear
and
listened
but
as
before
only
the
whistling
of
the
wind
could
be
heard
the
flapping
and
fluttering
of
the
kerchief
tied
to
the
shafts
and
the
pelting
of
the
snow
against
the
woodwork
of
the
sledge
he
again
covered
up
his
ear
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
stayed
the
night
well
no
matter
we
ll
get
there
it
s
only
one
day
lost
and
the
others
won
t
travel
in
such
then
he
remembered
that
on
the
he
had
to
receive
payment
from
the
butcher
for
his
oxen
he
meant
to
come
himself
but
he
won
t
find
me
and
my
wife
won
t
know
how
to
receive
the
money
she
doesn
t
know
the
right
way
of
doing
things
he
thought
recalling
how
at
their
party
the
day
before
she
had
not
known
how
to
treat
the
who
was
their
guest
of
course
she
s
only
a
woman
where
could
she
have
seen
anything
in
my
father
s
time
what
was
our
house
like
just
a
rich
peasant
s
house
just
an
oatmill
and
an
inn
that
was
the
whole
property
but
what
have
i
done
in
these
fifteen
years
a
shop
two
taverns
a
a
two
farms
leased
out
and
a
house
with
an
barn
he
thought
proudly
not
as
it
was
in
father
s
time
who
is
talked
of
in
the
whole
district
now
brekhunov
and
why
because
i
stick
to
business
i
take
trouble
not
like
others
who
lie
abed
or
waste
their
time
on
foolishness
while
i
don
t
sleep
of
nights
blizzard
or
no
blizzard
i
start
out
so
business
gets
done
they
think
is
a
joke
no
take
pains
and
rack
your
brains
you
get
overtaken
out
of
doors
at
night
like
this
or
keep
awake
night
after
night
till
the
thoughts
whirling
in
your
head
make
the
pillow
turn
he
meditated
with
pride
they
think
people
get
on
through
luck
after
all
the
mironovs
are
now
millionaires
and
why
take
pains
and
god
gives
if
only
he
grants
me
health
the
thought
that
he
might
himself
be
a
millionaire
like
mironov
who
began
with
nothing
so
excited
vasili
andreevich
that
he
felt
the
need
of
talking
to
somebody
but
there
was
no
one
to
talk
to
if
only
he
could
have
reached
goryachkin
he
would
have
talked
to
the
landlord
and
shown
him
a
thing
or
two
just
see
how
it
blows
it
will
snow
us
up
so
deep
that
we
shan
t
be
able
to
get
out
in
the
morning
he
thought
listening
to
a
gust
of
wind
that
blew
against
the
front
of
the
sledge
bending
it
and
lashing
the
snow
against
it
he
raised
himself
and
looked
round
all
he
could
see
through
the
whirling
darkness
was
mukhorty
s
dark
head
his
back
covered
by
the
fluttering
drugget
and
his
thick
knotted
tail
while
all
round
in
front
and
behind
was
the
same
fluctuating
whity
darkness
sometimes
seeming
to
get
a
little
lighter
and
sometimes
growing
denser
still
a
pity
i
listened
to
nikita
he
thought
we
ought
to
have
driven
on
we
should
have
come
out
somewhere
if
only
back
to
grishkino
and
stayed
the
night
at
taras
s
as
it
is
we
must
sit
here
all
night
but
what
was
i
thinking
about
yes
that
god
gives
to
those
who
take
trouble
but
not
to
loafers
or
fools
i
must
have
a
smoke
he
sat
down
again
got
out
his
and
stretched
himself
flat
on
his
stomach
screening
the
matches
with
the
skirt
of
his
coat
but
the
wind
found
its
way
in
and
put
out
match
after
match
at
last
he
got
one
to
burn
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
was
very
glad
that
he
had
managed
to
do
what
he
wanted
and
though
the
wind
smoked
more
of
the
cigarette
than
he
did
he
still
got
two
or
three
puffs
and
felt
more
cheerful
he
again
leant
back
wrapped
himself
up
started
reflecting
and
remembering
and
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
lost
consciousness
and
fell
asleep
suddenly
something
seemed
to
give
him
a
push
and
awoke
him
whether
it
was
mukhorty
who
had
pulled
some
straw
from
under
him
or
whether
something
within
him
had
startled
him
at
all
events
it
woke
him
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
faster
and
faster
so
that
the
sledge
seemed
to
tremble
under
him
he
opened
his
eyes
everything
around
him
was
just
as
before
it
looks
lighter
he
thought
i
expect
it
won
t
be
long
before
but
he
at
once
remembered
that
it
was
lighter
because
the
moon
had
risen
he
sat
up
and
looked
first
at
the
horse
mukhorty
still
stood
with
his
back
to
the
wind
shivering
all
over
one
side
of
the
drugget
which
was
completely
covered
with
snow
had
been
blown
back
the
breeching
had
slipped
down
and
the
head
with
its
waving
forelock
and
mane
were
now
more
visible
vasili
andreevich
leant
over
the
back
of
the
sledge
and
looked
behind
nikita
still
sat
in
the
same
position
in
which
he
had
settled
himself
the
sacking
with
which
he
was
covered
and
his
legs
were
thickly
covered
with
snow
if
only
that
peasant
doesn
t
freeze
to
death
his
clothes
are
so
wretched
i
may
be
held
responsible
for
him
what
shiftless
people
they
are
such
a
want
of
education
thought
vasili
andreevich
and
he
felt
like
taking
the
drugget
off
the
horse
and
putting
it
over
nikita
but
it
would
be
very
cold
to
get
out
and
move
about
and
moreover
the
horse
might
freeze
to
death
why
did
i
bring
him
with
me
it
was
all
her
stupidity
he
thought
recalling
his
unloved
wife
and
he
rolled
over
into
his
old
place
at
the
front
part
of
the
sledge
my
uncle
once
spent
a
whole
night
like
this
he
reflected
and
was
all
but
another
case
came
at
once
to
his
mind
but
when
they
dug
sebastian
out
he
was
dead
stiff
like
a
frozen
carcass
if
i
d
only
stopped
the
night
in
grishkino
all
this
would
not
have
happened
and
wrapping
his
coat
carefully
round
him
so
that
none
of
the
warmth
of
the
fur
should
be
wasted
but
should
warm
him
all
over
neck
knees
and
feet
he
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
again
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
get
drowsy
on
the
contrary
he
felt
wide
awake
and
animated
again
he
began
counting
his
gains
and
the
debts
due
to
him
again
he
began
bragging
to
himself
and
feeling
pleased
with
himself
and
his
position
but
all
this
was
continually
disturbed
by
a
stealthily
approaching
fear
and
by
the
unpleasant
regret
that
he
had
not
remained
in
grishkino
how
different
it
would
be
to
be
lying
warm
on
a
bench
he
turned
over
several
times
in
his
attempts
to
get
into
a
more
comfortable
position
more
sheltered
from
the
wind
he
wrapped
up
his
legs
closer
shut
his
eyes
and
lay
still
but
either
his
legs
in
their
strong
felt
boots
began
to
ache
from
being
bent
in
one
position
or
the
wind
blew
in
somewhere
and
after
lying
still
for
a
short
time
he
again
began
to
recall
the
disturbing
fact
that
he
might
now
have
been
lying
quietly
in
the
warm
hut
at
grishkino
he
again
sat
up
turned
about
muffled
himself
up
and
settled
down
once
more
once
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
distant
he
felt
glad
turned
down
his
and
listened
with
strained
attention
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
wind
whistling
between
the
shafts
the
flapping
of
the
kerchief
and
the
snow
pelting
against
the
frame
of
the
sledge
nikita
sat
just
as
he
had
done
all
the
time
not
moving
and
not
even
answering
vasili
andreevich
who
had
addressed
him
a
couple
of
times
he
doesn
t
care
a
bit
he
s
probably
asleep
thought
vasili
andreevich
with
vexation
looking
behind
the
sledge
at
nikita
who
was
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
snow
vasili
andreevich
got
up
and
lay
down
again
some
twenty
times
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
night
would
never
end
it
must
be
getting
near
morning
he
thought
getting
up
and
looking
around
let
s
have
a
look
at
my
watch
it
will
be
cold
to
unbutton
but
if
i
only
know
that
it
s
getting
near
morning
i
shall
at
any
rate
feel
more
cheerful
we
could
begin
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
vasili
andreevich
knew
that
it
could
not
yet
be
near
morning
but
he
was
growing
more
and
more
afraid
and
wished
both
to
get
to
know
and
yet
to
deceive
himself
he
carefully
undid
the
fastening
of
his
sheepskin
pushed
in
his
hand
and
felt
about
for
a
long
time
before
he
got
to
his
waistcoat
with
great
difficulty
he
managed
to
draw
out
his
silver
watch
with
its
enamelled
flower
design
and
tried
to
make
out
the
time
he
could
not
see
anything
without
a
light
again
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
elbows
as
he
had
done
when
he
lighted
a
cigarette
got
out
his
matches
and
proceeded
to
strike
one
this
time
he
went
to
work
more
carefully
and
feeling
with
his
fingers
for
a
match
with
the
largest
head
and
the
greatest
amount
of
phosphorus
lit
it
at
the
first
try
bringing
the
face
of
the
watch
under
the
light
he
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
it
was
only
ten
minutes
past
twelve
almost
the
whole
night
was
still
before
him
oh
how
long
the
night
is
he
thought
feeling
a
cold
shudder
run
down
his
back
and
having
fastened
his
fur
coats
again
and
wrapped
himself
up
he
snuggled
into
a
corner
of
the
sledge
intending
to
wait
patiently
suddenly
above
the
monotonous
roar
of
the
wind
he
clearly
distinguished
another
new
and
living
sound
it
steadily
strengthened
and
having
become
quite
clear
diminished
just
as
gradually
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
a
wolf
and
he
was
so
near
that
the
movement
of
his
jaws
as
he
changed
his
cry
was
brought
down
the
wind
vasili
andreevich
turned
back
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
listened
attentively
mukhorty
too
strained
to
listen
moving
his
ears
and
when
the
wolf
had
ceased
its
howling
he
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
and
gave
a
warning
snort
after
this
vasili
andreevich
could
not
fall
asleep
again
or
even
calm
himself
the
more
he
tried
to
think
of
his
accounts
his
business
his
reputation
his
worth
and
his
wealth
the
more
and
more
was
he
mastered
by
fear
and
regrets
that
he
had
not
stayed
the
night
at
grishkino
dominated
and
mingled
in
all
his
thoughts
devil
take
the
forest
things
were
all
right
without
it
thank
god
ah
if
we
had
only
put
up
for
the
night
he
said
to
himself
they
say
it
s
drunkards
that
freeze
he
thought
and
i
have
had
some
and
observing
his
sensations
he
noticed
that
he
was
beginning
to
shiver
without
knowing
whether
it
was
from
cold
or
from
fear
he
tried
to
wrap
himself
up
and
lie
down
as
before
but
could
no
longer
do
so
he
could
not
stay
in
one
position
he
wanted
to
get
up
to
do
something
to
master
the
gathering
fear
that
was
rising
in
him
and
against
which
he
felt
himself
powerless
he
again
got
out
his
cigarettes
and
matches
but
only
three
matches
were
left
and
they
were
bad
ones
the
phosphorus
rubbed
off
them
all
without
lighting
the
devil
take
you
damned
thing
curse
you
he
muttered
not
knowing
whom
or
what
he
was
cursing
and
he
flung
away
the
crushed
cigarette
he
was
about
to
throw
away
the
matchbox
too
but
checked
the
movement
of
his
hand
and
put
the
box
in
his
pocket
instead
he
was
seized
with
such
unrest
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
one
spot
he
climbed
out
of
the
sledge
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
wind
began
to
shift
his
belt
again
fastening
it
lower
down
in
the
waist
and
tightening
it
what
s
the
use
of
lying
and
waiting
for
death
better
mount
the
horse
and
get
away
the
thought
suddenly
occurred
to
him
the
horse
will
move
when
he
has
someone
on
his
back
as
for
him
he
thought
of
nikita
it
s
all
the
same
to
him
whether
he
lives
or
dies
what
is
his
life
worth
he
won
t
grudge
his
life
but
i
have
something
to
live
for
thank
he
untied
the
horse
threw
the
reins
over
his
neck
and
tried
to
mount
but
his
coats
and
boots
were
so
heavy
that
he
failed
then
he
clambered
up
in
the
sledge
and
tried
to
mount
from
there
but
the
sledge
tilted
under
his
weight
and
he
failed
again
at
last
he
drew
mukhorty
nearer
to
the
sledge
cautiously
balanced
on
one
side
of
it
and
managed
to
lie
on
his
stomach
across
the
horse
s
back
after
lying
like
that
for
a
while
he
shifted
forward
once
and
again
threw
a
leg
over
and
finally
seated
himself
supporting
his
feet
on
the
loose
the
shaking
of
the
sledge
awoke
nikita
he
raised
himself
and
it
seemed
to
vasili
andreevich
that
he
said
something
listen
to
such
fools
as
you
am
i
to
die
like
this
for
nothing
exclaimed
vasili
andreevich
and
tucking
the
loose
skirts
of
his
fur
coat
in
under
his
knees
he
turned
the
horse
and
rode
away
from
the
sledge
in
the
direction
in
which
he
thought
the
forest
and
the
forester
s
hut
must
be
vii
from
the
time
he
had
covered
himself
with
the
sackcloth
and
seated
himself
behind
the
sledge
nikita
had
not
stirred
like
all
those
who
live
in
touch
with
nature
and
have
known
want
he
was
patient
and
could
wait
for
hours
even
days
without
growing
restless
or
irritable
he
heard
his
master
call
him
but
did
not
answer
because
he
did
not
want
to
move
or
talk
though
he
still
felt
some
warmth
from
the
tea
he
had
drunk
and
from
his
energetic
struggle
when
clambering
about
in
the
snowdrift
he
knew
that
this
warmth
would
not
last
long
and
that
he
had
no
strength
left
to
warm
himself
again
by
moving
about
for
he
felt
as
tired
as
a
horse
when
it
stops
and
refuses
to
go
further
in
spite
of
the
whip
and
its
master
sees
that
it
must
be
fed
before
it
can
work
again
the
foot
in
the
boot
with
a
hole
in
it
had
already
grown
numb
and
he
could
no
longer
feel
his
big
toe
besides
that
his
whole
body
began
to
feel
colder
and
colder
the
thought
that
he
might
and
very
probably
would
die
that
night
occurred
to
him
but
did
not
seem
particularly
unpleasant
or
dreadful
it
did
not
seem
particularly
unpleasant
because
his
whole
life
had
been
not
a
continual
holiday
but
on
the
contrary
an
unceasing
round
of
toil
of
which
he
was
beginning
to
feel
weary
and
it
did
not
seem
particularly
dreadful
because
besides
the
masters
he
had
served
here
like
vasili
andreevich
he
always
felt
himself
dependent
on
the
chief
master
who
had
sent
him
into
this
life
and
he
knew
that
when
dying
he
would
still
be
in
that
master
s
power
and
would
not
be
by
him
it
seems
a
pity
to
give
up
what
one
is
used
to
and
accustomed
to
but
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
i
shall
get
used
to
the
new
sins
he
thought
and
remembered
his
drunkenness
the
money
that
had
gone
on
drink
how
he
had
offended
his
wife
his
cursing
his
neglect
of
church
and
of
the
fasts
and
all
the
things
the
priest
blamed
him
for
at
confession
of
course
they
are
sins
but
then
did
i
take
them
on
of
myself
that
s
evidently
how
god
made
me
well
and
the
sins
where
am
i
to
escape
to
so
at
first
he
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
him
that
night
and
then
did
not
return
to
such
thoughts
but
gave
himself
up
to
whatever
recollections
came
into
his
head
of
themselves
now
he
thought
of
martha
s
arrival
of
the
drunkenness
among
the
workers
and
his
own
renunciation
of
drink
then
of
their
present
journey
and
of
taras
s
house
and
the
talk
about
the
of
the
family
then
of
his
own
lad
and
of
mukhorty
now
sheltered
under
the
drugget
and
then
of
his
master
who
made
the
sledge
creak
as
he
tossed
about
in
it
i
expect
you
re
sorry
yourself
that
you
started
out
dear
man
he
thought
it
would
seem
hard
to
leave
a
life
such
as
his
it
s
not
like
the
likes
of
then
all
these
recollections
began
to
grow
confused
and
got
mixed
in
his
head
and
he
fell
asleep
but
when
vasili
andreevich
getting
on
the
horse
jerked
the
sledge
against
the
back
of
which
nikita
was
leaning
and
it
shifted
away
and
hit
him
in
the
back
with
one
of
its
runners
he
awoke
and
had
to
change
his
position
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
straightening
his
legs
with
difficulty
and
shaking
the
snow
off
them
he
got
up
and
an
agonizing
cold
immediately
penetrated
his
whole
body
on
making
out
what
was
happening
he
called
to
vasili
andreevich
to
leave
him
the
drugget
which
the
horse
no
longer
needed
so
that
he
might
wrap
himself
in
it
but
vasili
andreevich
did
not
stop
but
disappeared
amid
the
powdery
snow
left
alone
nikita
considered
for
a
moment
what
he
should
do
he
felt
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
go
off
in
search
of
a
house
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
sit
down
in
his
old
place
it
was
by
now
all
filled
with
snow
he
felt
that
he
could
not
get
warmer
in
the
sledge
either
for
there
was
nothing
to
cover
himself
with
and
his
coat
and
sheepskin
no
longer
warmed
him
at
all
he
felt
as
cold
as
though
he
had
nothing
on
but
a
shirt
he
became
frightened
lord
heavenly
father
he
muttered
and
was
comforted
by
the
consciousness
that
he
was
not
alone
but
that
there
was
one
who
heard
him
and
would
not
abandon
him
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
keeping
the
sackcloth
over
his
head
he
got
inside
the
sledge
and
lay
down
in
the
place
where
his
master
had
been
but
he
could
not
get
warm
in
the
sledge
either
at
first
he
shivered
all
over
then
the
shivering
ceased
and
little
by
little
he
began
to
lose
consciousness
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
dying
or
falling
asleep
but
felt
equally
prepared
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
viii
meanwhile
vasili
andreevich
with
his
feet
and
the
ends
of
the
reins
urged
the
horse
on
in
the
direction
in
which
for
some
reason
he
expected
the
forest
and
forester
s
hut
to
be
the
snow
covered
his
eyes
and
the
wind
seemed
intent
on
stopping
him
but
bending
forward
and
constantly
lapping
his
coat
over
and
pushing
it
between
himself
and
the
cold
harness
pad
which
prevented
him
from
sitting
properly
he
kept
urging
the
horse
on
mukhorty
ambled
on
obediently
though
with
difficulty
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
driven
vasili
andreevich
rode
for
about
five
minutes
straight
ahead
as
he
thought
seeing
nothing
but
the
horse
s
head
and
the
white
waste
and
hearing
only
the
whistle
of
the
wind
about
the
horse
s
ears
and
his
coat
collar
suddenly
a
dark
patch
showed
up
in
front
of
him
his
heart
beat
with
joy
and
he
rode
towards
the
object
already
seeing
in
imagination
the
walls
of
village
houses
but
the
dark
patch
was
not
stationary
it
kept
moving
and
it
was
not
a
village
but
some
tall
stalks
of
wormwood
sticking
up
through
the
snow
on
the
boundary
between
two
fields
and
desperately
tossing
about
under
the
pressure
of
the
wind
which
beat
it
all
to
one
side
and
whistled
through
it
the
sight
of
that
wormwood
tormented
by
the
pitiless
wind
made
vasili
andreevich
shudder
he
knew
not
why
and
he
hurriedly
began
urging
the
horse
on
not
noticing
that
when
riding
up
to
the
wormwood
he
had
quite
changed
his
direction
and
was
now
heading
the
opposite
way
though
still
imagining
that
he
was
riding
towards
where
the
hut
should
be
but
the
horse
kept
making
towards
the
right
and
vasili
andreevich
kept
guiding
it
to
the
left
again
something
dark
appeared
in
front
of
him
again
he
rejoiced
convinced
that
now
it
was
certainly
a
village
but
once
more
it
was
the
same
boundary
line
overgrown
with
wormwood
once
more
the
same
wormwood
desperately
tossed
by
the
wind
and
carrying
unreasoning
terror
to
his
heart
but
its
being
the
same
wormwood
was
not
all
for
beside
it
there
was
a
horse
s
track
partly
snowed
over
vasili
andreevich
stopped
stooped
down
and
looked
carefully
it
was
a
only
partially
covered
with
snow
and
could
be
none
but
his
own
horse
s
hoofprints
he
had
evidently
gone
round
in
a
small
circle
i
shall
perish
like
that
he
thought
and
not
to
give
way
to
his
terror
he
urged
on
the
horse
still
more
peering
into
the
snowy
darkness
in
which
he
saw
only
flitting
and
fitful
points
of
light
once
he
thought
he
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
or
the
howling
of
wolves
but
the
sounds
were
so
faint
and
indistinct
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
heard
them
or
merely
imagined
them
and
he
stopped
and
began
to
listen
intently
suddenly
some
terrible
deafening
cry
resounded
near
his
ears
and
everything
shivered
and
shook
under
him
he
seized
mukhorty
s
neck
but
that
too
was
shaking
all
over
and
the
terrible
cry
grew
still
more
frightful
for
some
seconds
vasili
andreevich
could
not
collect
himself
or
understand
what
was
happening
it
was
only
that
mukhorty
whether
to
encourage
himself
or
to
call
for
help
had
neighed
loudly
and
resonantly
ugh
you
wretch
how
you
frightened
me
damn
you
thought
vasili
andreevich
but
even
when
he
understood
the
cause
of
his
terror
he
could
not
shake
it
off
i
must
calm
myself
and
think
things
over
he
said
to
himself
but
yet
he
could
not
stop
and
continued
to
urge
the
horse
on
without
noticing
that
he
was
now
going
with
the
wind
instead
of
against
it
his
body
especially
between
his
legs
where
it
touched
the
pad
of
the
harness
and
was
not
covered
by
his
overcoats
was
getting
painfully
cold
especially
when
the
horse
walked
slowly
his
legs
and
arms
trembled
and
his
breathing
came
fast
he
saw
himself
perishing
amid
this
dreadful
snowy
waste
and
could
see
no
means
of
escape
suddenly
the
horse
under
him
tumbled
into
something
and
sinking
into
a
began
to
plunge
and
fell
on
his
side
vasili
andreevich
jumped
off
and
in
so
doing
dragged
to
one
side
the
breechband
on
which
his
foot
was
resting
and
twisted
round
the
pad
to
which
he
held
as
he
dismounted
as
soon
as
he
had
jumped
off
the
horse
struggled
to
his
feet
plunged
forward
gave
one
leap
and
another
neighed
again
and
dragging
the
drugget
and
the
breechband
after
him
disappeared
leaving
vasili
andreevich
alone
on
the
the
latter
pressed
on
after
the
horse
but
the
snow
lay
so
deep
and
his
coats
were
so
heavy
that
sinking
above
his
knees
at
each
step
he
stopped
breathless
after
taking
not
more
than
twenty
steps
the
copse
the
oxen
the
the
shop
the
tavern
the
house
with
the
barn
and
my
heir
thought
he
how
can
i
leave
all
that
what
does
this
mean
it
can
not
be
these
thoughts
flashed
through
his
mind
then
he
thought
of
the
wormwood
tossed
by
the
wind
which
he
had
twice
ridden
past
and
he
was
seized
with
such
terror
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
reality
of
what
was
happening
to
him
can
this
be
a
dream
he
thought
and
tried
to
wake
up
but
could
not
it
was
real
snow
that
lashed
his
face
and
covered
him
and
chilled
his
right
hand
from
which
he
had
lost
the
glove
and
this
was
a
real
desert
in
which
he
was
now
left
alone
like
that
wormwood
awaiting
an
inevitable
speedy
and
meaningless
death
queen
of
heaven
holy
father
nicholas
teacher
of
temperance
he
thought
recalling
the
service
of
the
day
before
and
the
holy
icon
with
its
black
face
and
gilt
frame
and
the
tapers
which
he
sold
to
be
set
before
that
icon
and
which
were
almost
immediately
brought
back
to
him
scarcely
burnt
at
all
and
which
he
put
away
in
the
he
began
to
pray
to
that
same
nicholas
the
to
save
him
promising
him
a
thanksgiving
service
and
some
candles
but
he
clearly
and
indubitably
realized
that
the
icon
its
frame
the
candles
the
priest
and
the
thanksgiving
service
though
very
important
and
necessary
in
church
could
do
nothing
for
him
here
and
that
there
was
and
could
be
no
connexion
between
those
candles
and
services
and
his
present
disastrous
plight
i
must
not
despair
he
thought
i
must
follow
the
horse
s
track
before
it
is
snowed
under
he
will
lead
me
out
or
i
may
even
catch
him
only
i
must
not
hurry
or
i
shall
stick
fast
and
be
more
lost
than
but
in
spite
of
his
resolution
to
go
quietly
he
rushed
forward
and
even
ran
continually
falling
getting
up
and
falling
again
the
horse
s
track
was
already
hardly
visible
in
places
where
the
snow
did
not
lie
deep
i
am
lost
thought
vasili
andreevich
i
shall
lose
the
track
and
not
catch
the
but
at
that
moment
he
saw
something
black
it
was
mukhorty
and
not
only
mukhorty
but
the
sledge
with
the
shafts
and
the
kerchief
mukhorty
with
the
sacking
and
the
breechband
twisted
round
to
one
side
was
standing
not
in
his
former
place
but
nearer
to
the
shafts
shaking
his
head
which
the
reins
he
was
stepping
on
drew
downwards
it
turned
out
that
vasili
andreevich
had
sunk
in
the
same
ravine
nikita
had
previously
fallen
into
and
that
mukhorty
had
been
bringing
him
back
to
the
sledge
and
he
had
got
off
his
back
no
more
than
fifty
paces
from
where
the
sledge
was
ix
having
stumbled
back
to
the
sledge
vasili
andreevich
caught
hold
of
it
and
for
a
long
time
stood
motionless
trying
to
calm
himself
and
recover
his
breath
nikita
was
not
in
his
former
place
but
something
already
covered
with
snow
was
lying
in
the
sledge
and
vasili
andreevich
concluded
that
this
was
nikita
his
terror
had
now
quite
left
him
and
if
he
felt
any
fear
it
was
lest
the
dreadful
terror
should
return
that
he
had
experienced
when
on
the
horse
and
especially
when
he
was
left
alone
in
the
at
any
cost
he
had
to
avoid
that
terror
and
to
keep
it
away
he
must
do
something
occupy
himself
with
something
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
his
back
to
the
wind
and
open
his
fur
coat
then
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
breath
a
little
he
shook
the
snow
out
of
his
boots
and
out
of
his
glove
the
glove
was
hopelessly
lost
and
by
this
time
probably
lying
somewhere
under
a
dozen
inches
of
snow
then
as
was
his
custom
when
going
out
of
his
shop
to
buy
grain
from
the
peasants
he
pulled
his
girdle
low
down
and
tightened
it
and
prepared
for
action
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
him
was
to
free
mukhorty
s
leg
from
the
rein
having
done
that
and
tethered
him
to
the
iron
cramp
at
the
front
of
the
sledge
where
he
had
been
before
he
was
going
round
the
horse
s
quarters
to
put
the
breechband
and
pad
straight
and
cover
him
with
the
cloth
but
at
that
moment
he
noticed
that
something
was
moving
in
the
sledge
and
nikita
s
head
rose
up
out
of
the
snow
that
covered
it
nikita
who
was
half
frozen
rose
with
great
difficulty
and
sat
up
moving
his
hand
before
his
nose
in
a
strange
manner
just
as
if
he
were
driving
away
flies
he
waved
his
hand
and
said
something
and
seemed
to
vasili
andreevich
to
be
calling
him
vasili
andreevich
left
the
cloth
unadjusted
and
went
up
to
the
sledge
what
is
it
he
asked
what
are
you
saying
i
m
dy
ing
that
s
what
said
nikita
brokenly
and
with
difficulty
give
what
is
owing
to
me
to
my
lad
or
to
my
wife
no
why
are
you
really
frozen
asked
vasili
andreevich
i
feel
it
s
my
death
forgive
me
for
christ
s
sake
said
nikita
in
a
tearful
voice
continuing
to
wave
his
hand
before
his
face
as
if
driving
away
flies
vasili
andreevich
stood
silent
and
motionless
for
half
a
minute
then
suddenly
with
the
same
resolution
with
which
he
used
to
strike
hands
when
making
a
good
purchase
he
took
a
step
back
and
turning
up
his
sleeves
began
raking
the
snow
off
nikita
and
out
of
the
sledge
having
done
this
he
hurriedly
undid
his
girdle
opened
out
his
fur
coat
and
having
pushed
nikita
down
lay
down
on
top
of
him
covering
him
not
only
with
his
fur
coat
but
with
the
whole
of
his
body
which
glowed
with
warmth
after
pushing
the
skirts
of
his
coat
between
nikita
and
the
sides
of
the
sledge
and
holding
down
its
hem
with
his
knees
vasili
andreevich
lay
like
that
face
down
with
his
head
pressed
against
the
front
of
the
sledge
here
he
no
longer
heard
the
horse
s
movements
or
the
whistling
of
the
wind
but
only
nikita
s
breathing
at
first
and
for
a
long
time
nikita
lay
motionless
then
he
sighed
deeply
and
moved
there
and
you
say
you
are
dying
lie
still
and
get
warm
that
s
our
way
began
vasili
andreevich
but
to
his
great
surprise
he
could
say
no
more
for
tears
came
to
his
eyes
and
his
lower
jaw
began
to
quiver
rapidly
he
stopped
speaking
and
only
gulped
down
the
risings
in
his
throat
seems
i
was
badly
frightened
and
have
gone
quite
weak
he
thought
but
this
weakness
was
not
only
unpleasant
but
gave
him
a
peculiar
joy
such
as
he
had
never
felt
before
that
s
our
way
he
said
to
himself
experiencing
a
strange
and
solemn
tenderness
he
lay
like
that
for
a
long
time
wiping
his
eyes
on
the
fur
of
his
coat
and
tucking
under
his
knee
the
right
skirt
which
the
wind
kept
turning
up
but
he
longed
so
passionately
to
tell
somebody
of
his
joyful
condition
that
he
said
nikita
it
s
comfortable
warm
came
a
voice
from
beneath
there
you
see
friend
i
was
going
to
perish
and
you
would
have
been
frozen
and
i
should
have
but
again
his
jaws
began
to
quiver
and
his
eyes
to
fill
with
tears
and
he
could
say
no
more
well
never
mind
he
thought
i
know
about
myself
what
i
he
remained
silent
and
lay
like
that
for
a
long
time
nikita
kept
him
warm
from
below
and
his
fur
coats
from
above
only
his
hands
with
which
he
kept
his
down
round
nikita
s
sides
and
his
legs
which
the
wind
kept
uncovering
began
to
freeze
especially
his
right
hand
which
had
no
glove
but
he
did
not
think
of
his
legs
or
of
his
hands
but
only
of
how
to
warm
the
peasant
who
was
lying
under
him
he
looked
out
several
times
at
mukhorty
and
could
see
that
his
back
was
uncovered
and
the
drugget
and
breeching
lying
on
the
snow
and
that
he
ought
to
get
up
and
cover
him
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
nikita
and
disturb
even
for
a
moment
the
joyous
condition
he
was
in
he
no
longer
felt
any
kind
of
terror
no
fear
we
shan
t
lose
him
this
time
he
said
to
himself
referring
to
his
getting
the
peasant
warm
with
the
same
boastfulness
with
which
he
spoke
of
his
buying
and
selling
vasili
andreevich
lay
in
that
way
for
one
hour
another
and
a
third
but
he
was
unconscious
of
the
passage
of
time
at
first
impressions
of
the
the
and
the
horse
with
the
shaking
before
his
eyes
kept
passing
through
his
mind
then
he
remembered
nikita
lying
under
him
then
recollections
of
the
festival
his
wife
the
and
the
box
of
candles
began
to
mingle
with
these
then
again
nikita
this
time
lying
under
that
box
then
the
peasants
customers
and
traders
and
the
white
walls
of
his
house
with
its
iron
roof
with
nikita
lying
underneath
presented
themselves
to
his
imagination
afterwards
all
these
impressions
blended
into
one
nothingness
as
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
unite
into
one
white
light
so
all
these
different
impressions
mingled
into
one
and
he
fell
asleep
for
a
long
time
he
slept
without
dreaming
but
just
before
dawn
the
visions
recommenced
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
standing
by
the
box
of
tapers
and
that
tikhon
s
wife
was
asking
for
a
five
kopek
taper
for
the
church
fete
he
wished
to
take
one
out
and
give
it
to
her
but
his
hands
would
not
life
being
held
tight
in
his
pockets
he
wanted
to
walk
round
the
box
but
his
feet
would
not
move
and
his
new
clean
goloshes
had
grown
to
the
stone
floor
and
he
could
neither
lift
them
nor
get
his
feet
out
of
the
goloshes
then
the
was
no
longer
a
box
but
a
bed
and
suddenly
vasili
andreevich
saw
himself
lying
in
his
bed
at
home
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
and
could
not
get
up
yet
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
get
up
because
ivan
matveich
the
would
soon
call
for
him
and
he
had
to
go
with
him
either
to
bargain
for
the
forest
or
to
put
mukhorty
s
breeching
straight
he
asked
his
wife
nikolaevna
hasn
t
he
come
yet
no
he
hasn
t
she
replied
he
heard
someone
drive
up
to
the
front
steps
it
must
be
no
he
s
gone
nikolaevna
i
say
nikolaevna
isn
t
he
here
yet
he
was
still
lying
on
his
bed
and
could
not
get
up
but
was
always
waiting
and
this
waiting
was
uncanny
and
yet
joyful
then
suddenly
his
joy
was
completed
he
whom
he
was
expecting
came
not
ivan
matveich
the
but
someone
else
yet
it
was
he
whom
he
had
been
waiting
for
he
came
and
called
him
and
it
was
he
who
had
called
him
and
told
him
to
lie
down
on
nikita
and
vasili
andreevich
was
glad
that
that
one
had
come
for
him
i
m
coming
he
cried
joyfully
and
that
cry
awoke
him
but
woke
him
up
not
at
all
the
same
person
he
had
been
when
he
fell
asleep
he
tried
to
get
up
but
could
not
tried
to
move
his
arm
and
could
not
to
move
his
leg
and
also
could
not
to
turn
his
head
and
could
not
he
was
surprised
but
not
at
all
disturbed
by
this
he
understood
that
this
was
death
and
was
not
at
all
disturbed
by
that
either
he
remembered
that
nikita
was
lying
under
him
and
that
he
had
got
warm
and
was
alive
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
nikita
and
nikita
was
he
and
that
his
life
was
not
in
himself
but
in
nikita
he
strained
his
ears
and
heard
nikita
breathing
and
even
slightly
snoring
nikita
is
alive
so
i
too
am
alive
he
said
to
himself
triumphantly
and
he
remembered
his
money
his
shop
his
house
the
buying
and
selling
and
mironov
s
millions
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
understand
why
that
man
called
vasili
brekhunov
had
troubled
himself
with
all
those
things
with
which
he
had
been
troubled
well
it
was
because
he
did
not
know
what
the
real
thing
was
he
thought
concerning
that
vasili
brekhunov
he
did
not
know
but
now
i
know
and
know
for
sure
now
i
know
and
again
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
one
who
had
called
him
before
i
m
coming
coming
he
responded
gladly
and
his
whole
being
was
filled
with
joyful
emotion
he
felt
himself
free
and
that
nothing
could
hold
him
back
any
longer
after
that
vasili
andreevich
neither
saw
heard
nor
felt
anything
more
in
this
world
all
around
the
snow
still
eddied
the
same
whirlwinds
of
snow
circled
about
covering
the
dead
vasili
andreevich
s
fur
coat
the
shivering
mukhorty
the
sledge
now
scarcely
to
be
seen
and
nikita
lying
at
the
bottom
of
it
kept
warm
beneath
his
dead
master
x
nikita
awoke
before
daybreak
he
was
aroused
by
the
cold
that
had
begun
to
creep
down
his
back
he
had
dreamt
that
he
was
coming
from
the
mill
with
a
load
of
his
master
s
flour
and
when
crossing
the
stream
had
missed
the
bridge
and
let
the
cart
get
stuck
and
he
saw
that
he
had
crawled
under
the
cart
and
was
trying
to
lift
it
by
arching
his
back
but
strange
to
say
the
cart
did
not
move
it
stuck
to
his
back
and
he
could
neither
lift
it
nor
get
out
from
under
it
it
was
crushing
the
whole
of
his
loins
and
how
cold
it
felt
evidently
he
must
crawl
out
have
done
he
exclaimed
to
whoever
was
pressing
the
cart
down
on
him
take
out
the
sacks
but
the
cart
pressed
down
colder
and
colder
and
then
he
heard
a
strange
knocking
awoke
completely
and
remembered
everything
the
cold
cart
was
his
dead
and
frozen
master
lying
upon
him
and
the
knock
was
produced
by
mukhorty
who
had
twice
struck
the
sledge
with
his
hoof
andreevich
eh
andreevich
nikita
called
cautiously
beginning
to
realize
the
truth
and
straightening
his
back
but
vasili
andreevich
did
not
answer
and
his
stomach
and
legs
were
stiff
and
cold
and
heavy
like
iron
weights
he
must
have
died
may
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
thought
nikita
he
turned
his
head
dug
with
his
hand
through
the
snow
about
him
and
opened
his
eyes
it
was
daylight
the
wind
was
whistling
as
before
between
the
shafts
and
the
snow
was
falling
in
the
same
way
except
that
it
was
no
longer
driving
against
the
frame
of
the
sledge
but
silently
covered
both
sledge
and
horse
deeper
and
deeper
and
neither
the
horse
s
movements
nor
his
breathing
were
any
longer
to
be
heard
he
must
have
frozen
too
thought
nikita
of
mukhorty
and
indeed
those
hoof
knocks
against
the
sledge
which
had
awakened
nikita
were
the
last
efforts
the
already
numbed
mukhorty
had
made
to
keep
on
his
feet
before
dying
o
lord
god
it
seems
thou
art
calling
me
too
said
nikita
thy
holy
will
be
done
but
it
s
uncanny
still
a
man
can
t
die
twice
and
must
die
once
if
only
it
would
come
soon
and
he
again
drew
in
his
head
closed
his
eyes
and
became
unconscious
fully
convinced
that
now
he
was
certainly
and
finally
dying
it
was
not
till
noon
that
day
that
peasants
dug
vasili
andreevich
and
nikita
out
of
the
snow
with
their
shovels
not
more
than
seventy
yards
from
the
road
and
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
village
the
snow
had
hidden
the
sledge
but
the
shafts
and
the
kerchief
tied
to
them
were
still
visible
mukhorty
buried
up
to
his
belly
in
snow
with
the
breeching
and
drugget
hanging
down
stood
all
white
his
dead
head
pressed
against
his
frozen
throat
icicles
hung
from
his
nostrils
his
eyes
were
covered
with
as
though
filled
with
tears
and
he
had
grown
so
thin
in
that
one
night
that
he
was
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
vasili
andreevich
was
stiff
as
a
frozen
carcass
and
when
they
rolled
him
off
nikita
his
legs
remained
apart
and
his
arms
stretched
out
as
they
had
been
his
bulging
hawk
eyes
were
frozen
and
his
open
mouth
under
his
clipped
moustache
was
full
of
snow
but
nikita
though
chilled
through
was
still
alive
when
he
had
been
brought
to
he
felt
sure
that
he
was
already
dead
and
that
what
was
taking
place
with
him
was
no
longer
happening
in
this
world
but
in
the
next
when
he
heard
the
peasants
shouting
as
they
dug
him
out
and
rolled
the
frozen
body
of
vasili
andreevich
from
off
him
he
was
at
first
surprised
that
in
the
other
world
peasants
should
be
shouting
in
the
same
old
way
and
had
the
same
kind
of
body
and
then
when
he
realized
that
he
was
still
in
this
world
he
was
sorry
rather
than
glad
especially
when
he
found
that
the
toes
on
both
his
feet
were
frozen
nikita
lay
in
hospital
for
two
months
they
cut
off
three
of
his
toes
but
the
others
recovered
so
that
he
was
still
able
to
work
and
went
on
living
for
another
twenty
years
first
as
a
then
in
his
old
age
as
a
watchman
he
died
at
home
as
he
had
wished
only
this
year
under
the
icons
with
a
lighted
taper
in
his
hands
before
he
died
he
asked
his
wife
s
forgiveness
and
forgave
her
for
the
cooper
he
also
took
leave
of
his
son
and
grandchildren
and
died
sincerely
glad
that
he
was
relieving
his
son
and
of
the
burden
of
having
to
feed
him
and
that
he
was
now
really
passing
from
this
life
of
which
he
was
weary
into
that
other
life
which
every
year
and
every
hour
grew
clearer
and
more
desirable
to
him
whether
he
is
better
or
worse
off
there
where
he
awoke
after
his
death
whether
he
was
disappointed
or
found
there
what
he
expected
we
shall
all
soon
learn
