i
dedicate
this
story
to
the
tenth
there
are
some
of
us
now
reaching
middle
age
who
discover
themselves
to
be
lamenting
the
past
in
one
respect
if
in
none
other
that
there
are
no
books
written
now
for
children
comparable
with
those
of
thirty
years
ago
i
say
written
children
because
the
new
psychological
business
of
writing
them
as
though
they
were
small
pills
or
hatched
in
some
especially
scientific
method
is
extremely
popular
writing
for
children
rather
than
about
them
is
very
difficult
as
everybody
who
has
tried
it
knows
it
can
only
be
done
i
am
convinced
by
somebody
having
a
great
deal
of
the
child
in
his
own
outlook
and
sensibilities
such
was
the
author
of
the
little
duke
and
the
dove
in
the
eagle
s
nest
such
the
author
of
a
flatiron
for
a
farthing
and
the
story
of
a
short
such
above
all
the
author
of
alice
in
grownups
imagine
that
they
can
do
the
trick
by
adopting
baby
language
and
talking
down
to
their
very
critical
audience
there
never
was
a
greater
mistake
the
imagination
of
the
author
must
be
a
child
s
imagination
and
yet
maturely
consistent
so
that
the
white
queen
in
alice
for
instance
is
seen
just
as
a
child
would
see
her
but
she
continues
always
herself
through
all
her
distressing
adventures
the
supreme
touch
of
the
white
rabbit
pulling
on
his
white
gloves
as
he
hastens
is
again
absolutely
the
child
s
vision
but
the
white
rabbit
as
guide
and
introducer
of
alice
s
adventures
belongs
to
mature
grown
insight
geniuses
are
rare
and
without
being
at
all
an
undue
praiser
of
times
past
one
can
say
without
hesitation
that
until
the
appearance
of
hugh
lofting
the
successor
of
miss
yonge
ewing
gatty
and
lewis
carroll
had
not
appeared
i
remember
the
delight
with
which
some
six
months
ago
i
picked
up
the
first
dolittle
book
in
the
hampshire
bookshop
at
smith
college
in
northampton
one
of
lofting
s
pictures
was
quite
enough
for
me
the
picture
that
i
lighted
upon
when
i
first
opened
the
book
was
the
one
of
the
monkeys
making
a
chain
with
their
arms
across
the
gulf
then
i
looked
further
and
discovered
bumpo
reading
fairy
stories
to
himself
and
then
looked
again
and
there
was
a
picture
of
john
dolittle
s
house
but
pictures
are
not
enough
although
most
authors
draw
so
badly
that
if
one
of
them
happens
to
have
the
genius
for
line
that
lofting
shows
there
must
be
one
feels
something
in
his
writing
as
well
there
is
you
can
not
read
the
first
paragraph
of
the
book
which
begins
in
the
right
way
once
upon
a
time
without
knowing
that
lofting
believes
in
his
story
quite
as
much
as
he
expects
you
to
that
is
the
first
essential
for
a
story
teller
then
you
discover
as
you
read
on
that
he
has
the
right
eye
for
the
right
detail
what
mind
could
resist
this
intriguing
sentence
to
be
found
on
the
second
page
of
the
book
besides
the
in
the
pond
at
the
bottom
of
his
garden
he
had
rabbits
in
the
pantry
white
mice
in
his
piano
a
squirrel
in
the
linen
closet
and
a
hedgehog
in
the
and
then
when
you
read
a
little
further
you
will
discover
that
the
doctor
is
not
merely
a
peg
on
whom
to
hang
exciting
and
various
adventures
but
that
he
is
himself
a
man
of
original
and
lively
character
he
is
a
very
kindly
generous
man
and
anyone
who
has
ever
written
stories
will
know
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
make
kindly
generous
characters
interesting
than
unkindly
and
mean
ones
but
dolittle
is
interesting
it
is
not
only
that
he
is
quaint
but
that
he
is
wise
and
knows
what
he
is
about
the
reader
however
young
who
meets
him
gets
very
soon
a
sense
that
if
he
were
in
trouble
not
necessarily
medical
he
would
go
to
dolittle
and
ask
his
advice
about
it
dolittle
seems
to
extend
his
hand
from
the
page
and
grasp
that
of
his
reader
and
i
can
see
him
going
down
the
centuries
a
kind
of
pied
piper
with
thousands
of
children
at
his
heels
but
not
only
is
he
a
darling
and
alive
and
credible
but
his
creator
has
also
managed
to
invest
everybody
else
in
the
book
with
the
same
kind
of
life
now
this
business
of
giving
life
to
animals
making
them
talk
and
behave
like
human
beings
is
an
extremely
difficult
one
lewis
carroll
absolutely
conquered
the
difficulties
but
i
am
not
sure
that
anyone
after
him
until
hugh
lofting
has
really
managed
the
trick
even
in
such
a
masterpiece
as
the
wind
in
the
willows
we
are
not
quite
convinced
john
dolittle
s
friends
are
convincing
because
their
creator
never
forces
them
to
desert
their
own
characteristics
polynesia
for
instance
is
natural
from
first
to
last
she
really
does
care
about
the
doctor
but
she
cares
as
a
bird
would
care
having
always
some
place
to
which
she
is
going
when
her
business
with
her
friends
is
over
and
when
lofting
invents
fantastic
animals
he
gives
them
a
kind
of
credible
possibility
which
is
extraordinarily
convincing
it
will
be
impossible
for
anyone
who
has
read
this
book
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
who
would
be
credible
enough
even
were
there
no
drawing
of
it
but
the
picture
on
page
settles
the
matter
of
his
truth
once
and
for
all
in
fact
this
book
is
a
work
of
genius
and
as
always
with
works
of
genius
it
is
difficult
to
analyze
the
elements
that
have
gone
to
make
it
there
is
poetry
here
and
fantasy
and
humor
a
little
pathos
but
above
all
a
number
of
creations
in
whose
existence
everybody
must
believe
whether
they
be
children
of
four
or
old
men
of
ninety
or
prosperous
bankers
of
i
don
t
know
how
lofting
has
done
it
i
don
t
suppose
that
he
knows

mind
he
began
reading
the
to
himself
crying
bitterly
and
waving
till
the
ship
was
out

sight
they
are
surely
the
pirates
of

you
have
heard
that
rats
always

doctor
he
cried
i
ve

and
she
kissed
the
doctor
many
times
the
doctor
sat
in
a
chair
in

he
began
running
round
the
garden
like
a
crazy
thing
story
of
doctor
the
story
of
doctor
dolittle
first
puddleby
once
upon
a
time
many
years
our
grandfathers
were
little
was
a
doctor
and
his
name
was
dolittle
means
that
he
was
a
proper
doctor
and
knew
a
whole
lot
he
lived
in
a
little
town
called
all
the
folks
young
and
old
knew
him
well
by
sight
and
whenever
he
walked
down
the
street
in
his
high
hat
everyone
would
say
there
goes
the
doctor
s
a
clever
and
the
dogs
and
the
children
would
all
run
up
and
follow
behind
him
and
even
the
crows
that
lived
in
the
would
caw
and
nod
their
heads
the
house
he
lived
in
on
the
edge
of
the
town
was
quite
small
but
his
garden
was
very
large
and
had
a
wide
lawn
and
stone
seats
and
hanging
over
his
sister
sarah
dolittle
was
housekeeper
for
him
but
the
doctor
looked
after
the
garden
himself
he
was
very
fond
of
animals
and
kept
many
kinds
of
pets
besides
the
in
the
pond
at
the
bottom
of
his
garden
he
had
rabbits
in
the
pantry
white
mice
in
his
piano
a
squirrel
in
the
linen
closet
and
a
hedgehog
in
the
cellar
he
had
a
cow
with
a
calf
too
and
an
old
lame
years
of
chickens
and
pigeons
and
two
lambs
and
many
other
animals
but
his
favorite
pets
were
the
duck
jip
the
dog
the
baby
pig
polynesia
the
parrot
and
the
owl
illustration
and
she
never
came
to
see
him
any
more
his
sister
used
to
grumble
about
all
these
animals
and
said
they
made
the
house
untidy
and
one
day
when
an
old
lady
with
rheumatism
came
to
see
the
doctor
she
sat
on
the
hedgehog
who
was
sleeping
on
the
sofa
and
never
came
to
see
him
any
more
but
drove
every
saturday
all
the
way
to
oxenthorpe
another
town
ten
miles
off
to
see
a
different
doctor
then
his
sister
sarah
dolittle
came
to
him
and
said
john
how
can
you
expect
sick
people
to
come
and
see
you
when
you
keep
all
these
animals
in
the
house
it
s
a
fine
doctor
would
have
his
parlor
full
of
hedgehogs
and
mice
that
s
the
fourth
personage
these
animals
have
driven
away
squire
jenkins
and
the
parson
say
they
wouldn
t
come
near
your
house
matter
how
sick
they
are
we
are
getting
poorer
every
day
if
you
go
on
like
this
none
of
the
best
people
will
have
you
for
a
but
i
like
the
animals
better
than
the
best
people
said
the
doctor
you
are
ridiculous
said
his
sister
and
walked
out
of
the
room
so
as
time
went
on
the
doctor
got
more
and
more
animals
and
the
people
who
came
to
see
him
got
less
and
less
till
at
last
he
had
no
one
the
cat
who
didn
t
mind
any
kind
of
animals
but
the
cat
wasn
t
very
rich
and
he
only
got
sick
once
a
when
he
used
to
give
the
doctor
sixpence
for
a
bottle
of
medicine
sixpence
a
year
wasn
t
enough
to
live
in
those
days
long
ago
and
if
the
doctor
hadn
t
had
some
money
saved
up
in
his
no
one
knows
what
would
have
happened
and
he
kept
on
getting
still
more
pets
and
of
course
it
cost
a
lot
to
feed
them
and
the
money
he
had
saved
up
grew
littler
and
littler
then
he
sold
his
piano
and
let
the
mice
live
in
a
but
the
money
he
got
for
that
too
began
to
go
so
he
sold
the
brown
suit
he
wore
on
sundays
and
went
on
becoming
poorer
and
poorer
and
now
when
he
walked
down
the
street
in
his
high
hat
people
would
say
to
one
another
there
goes
john
dolittle
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
the
best
known
doctor
in
the
west
at
him
hasn
t
any
money
and
his
stockings
are
full
of
holes
but
the
dogs
and
the
cats
and
the
children
still
ran
up
and
followed
him
through
the
same
as
they
had
done
when
he
was
rich
second
animal
language
it
happened
one
day
that
the
doctor
was
sitting
in
his
kitchen
talking
with
the
cat
who
had
come
to
see
him
with
a
why
don
t
you
give
up
being
a
people
s
doctor
and
be
an
asked
the
cat
the
parrot
polynesia
was
sitting
in
the
window
looking
out
at
the
rain
and
singing
a
to
herself
she
stopped
singing
and
started
to
listen
you
see
doctor
the
cat
went
on
you
know
all
about
more
than
what
these
here
vets
do
that
book
you
cats
why
it
s
wonderful
i
can
t
read
or
write
maybe
write
some
books
but
my
wife
theodosia
she
s
a
scholar
she
is
and
she
read
your
book
to
me
well
it
s
s
all
can
be
you
might
have
been
a
cat
yourself
you
know
the
way
they
think
and
listen
you
can
make
a
lot
of
money
doctoring
animals
do
you
know
that
you
see
i
d
send
all
the
old
women
who
had
sick
cats
or
dogs
to
you
and
if
they
didn
t
get
sick
fast
enough
i
could
put
something
in
the
meat
i
sell
em
to
make
em
sick
see
oh
no
said
the
doctor
quickly
you
mustn
t
do
that
that
wouldn
t
be
oh
i
didn
t
mean
real
sick
answered
the
cat
just
a
little
something
to
make
them
was
what
i
had
reference
to
but
as
you
say
maybe
it
ain
t
quite
fair
on
the
animals
but
they
ll
get
sick
anyway
because
the
old
women
always
give
em
too
much
to
eat
and
look
all
the
farmers
round
about
who
had
lame
horses
and
weak
d
come
be
an
when
the
cat
had
gone
the
parrot
flew
off
the
window
on
to
the
doctor
s
table
and
said
that
man
s
got
sense
that
s
what
you
ought
to
do
be
an
give
the
silly
people
they
haven
t
brains
enough
to
see
you
re
the
best
doctor
in
the
world
take
care
of
animals
ll
soon
find
it
out
be
an
oh
there
are
plenty
of
said
john
dolittle
putting
the
outside
on
the
to
get
the
rain
yes
there
plenty
said
polynesia
but
none
of
them
are
any
good
at
all
now
listen
doctor
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
did
you
know
that
animals
can
talk
i
knew
that
parrots
can
talk
said
the
doctor
oh
we
parrots
can
talk
in
two
s
language
and
said
polynesia
proudly
if
i
say
polly
wants
a
cracker
you
understand
me
but
hear
this
good
gracious
cried
the
doctor
what
does
that
mean
that
means
is
the
porridge
hot
yet
my
you
don
t
say
so
said
the
doctor
you
never
talked
that
way
to
me
what
would
have
been
the
good
said
polynesia
dusting
some
off
her
left
wing
you
wouldn
t
have
understood
me
if
i
tell
me
some
more
said
the
doctor
all
excited
and
he
rushed
over
to
the
and
came
back
with
the
butcher
s
book
and
a
pencil
now
don
t
go
too
i
ll
write
it
down
this
is
quite
new
give
me
the
birds
so
that
was
the
way
the
doctor
came
to
know
that
animals
had
a
language
of
their
own
and
could
talk
to
one
another
and
all
that
afternoon
while
it
was
raining
polynesia
sat
on
the
kitchen
table
giving
him
bird
words
to
put
down
in
the
book
at
when
the
dog
jip
came
in
the
parrot
said
to
the
doctor
see
s
talking
to
looks
to
me
as
though
he
were
scratching
his
ear
said
the
doctor
but
animals
don
t
always
speak
with
their
mouths
said
the
parrot
in
a
high
voice
raising
her
eyebrows
they
talk
with
their
ears
with
their
feet
with
their
everything
sometimes
they
don
t
to
make
a
noise
do
you
see
now
the
way
he
s
twitching
up
one
side
of
his
nose
what
s
that
mean
asked
the
doctor
that
means
can
t
you
see
that
it
has
stopped
raining
polynesia
answered
he
is
asking
you
a
question
dogs
nearly
always
use
their
noses
for
asking
after
a
while
with
the
parrot
s
help
the
doctor
got
to
learn
the
language
of
the
animals
so
well
that
he
could
talk
to
them
himself
and
understand
everything
they
said
then
he
gave
up
being
a
people
s
doctor
altogether
as
soon
as
the
cat
had
told
every
one
that
john
dolittle
was
going
to
become
an
old
ladies
began
to
bring
him
their
pet
pugs
and
poodles
who
had
eaten
too
much
cake
and
farmers
came
many
miles
to
show
him
sick
cows
and
sheep
one
day
a
was
brought
to
him
and
the
poor
thing
was
terribly
glad
to
find
a
man
who
could
talk
in
you
know
doctor
said
the
horse
that
vet
over
the
hill
knows
nothing
at
all
he
has
been
treating
me
six
weeks
spavins
what
i
need
is
i
am
going
blind
in
one
eye
there
s
no
reason
why
horses
shouldn
t
wear
glasses
the
same
as
people
but
that
stupid
man
over
the
hill
never
even
looked
at
my
eyes
he
kept
on
giving
me
big
pills
i
tried
to
tell
him
but
he
couldn
t
understand
a
word
of
what
i
need
is
of
course
said
the
doctor
i
ll
get
you
some
at
i
would
like
a
pair
like
yours
said
the
only
green
they
ll
keep
the
sun
out
of
my
eyes
while
i
m
plowing
the
certainly
said
the
doctor
green
ones
you
shall
you
know
the
trouble
is
sir
said
the
as
the
doctor
opened
the
front
door
to
let
him
the
trouble
is
that
thinks
he
can
doctor
because
the
animals
don
t
complain
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
takes
a
much
cleverer
man
to
be
a
really
good
than
it
does
to
be
a
good
people
s
doctor
my
farmer
s
boy
thinks
he
knows
all
about
horses
i
wish
you
could
see
face
is
so
fat
he
looks
as
though
he
had
no
he
has
got
as
much
brain
as
a
he
tried
to
put
a
on
me
last
where
did
he
put
it
asked
the
doctor
oh
he
didn
t
put
it
me
said
the
horse
he
only
tried
to
i
kicked
him
into
the
well
well
said
the
doctor
i
m
a
pretty
quiet
creature
as
a
rule
said
the
very
patient
with
t
make
much
fuss
but
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
that
vet
giving
me
the
wrong
medicine
and
when
that
booby
started
to
monkey
with
me
i
just
couldn
t
bear
it
any
did
you
hurt
the
boy
much
asked
the
doctor
oh
no
said
the
horse
i
kicked
him
in
the
right
place
the
vet
s
looking
after
him
now
when
will
my
glasses
be
ready
i
ll
have
them
for
you
next
week
said
the
doctor
come
in
again
morning
illustration
he
could
see
as
well
as
ever
then
john
dolittle
got
a
fine
big
pair
of
green
spectacles
and
the
stopped
going
blind
in
one
eye
and
could
see
as
well
as
ever
and
soon
it
became
a
common
sight
to
see
wearing
glasses
in
the
country
round
puddleby
and
a
blind
horse
was
a
thing
unknown
and
so
it
was
with
all
the
other
animals
that
were
brought
to
him
as
soon
as
they
found
that
he
could
talk
their
language
they
told
him
where
the
pain
was
and
how
they
felt
and
of
course
it
was
easy
for
him
to
cure
them
illustration
they
came
at
once
to
his
house
on
the
edge
of
the
town
now
all
these
animals
went
back
and
told
their
brothers
and
friends
that
there
was
a
doctor
in
the
little
house
with
the
big
garden
who
really
a
doctor
and
whenever
any
creatures
got
only
horses
and
cows
and
all
the
little
things
of
the
fields
like
and
badgers
and
bats
they
came
at
once
to
his
house
on
the
edge
of
the
town
so
that
his
big
garden
was
nearly
always
crowded
with
animals
trying
to
get
in
to
see
him
there
were
so
many
that
came
that
he
had
to
have
special
doors
made
for
the
different
kinds
he
wrote
horses
over
the
front
door
cows
over
the
side
door
and
sheep
on
the
kitchen
door
each
kind
of
animal
had
a
separate
the
mice
had
a
tiny
tunnel
made
for
them
into
the
cellar
where
they
waited
patiently
in
rows
for
the
doctor
to
come
round
to
them
and
so
in
a
few
years
time
every
living
thing
for
miles
and
miles
got
to
know
about
john
dolittle
and
the
birds
who
flew
to
other
countries
in
the
winter
told
the
animals
in
foreign
lands
of
the
wonderful
doctor
of
who
could
understand
their
talk
and
help
them
in
their
troubles
in
this
way
he
became
famous
among
the
over
the
known
even
than
he
had
been
among
the
folks
of
the
west
country
and
he
was
happy
and
liked
his
life
very
much
one
afternoon
when
the
doctor
was
busy
writing
in
a
book
polynesia
sat
in
the
she
nearly
always
out
at
the
leaves
blowing
about
in
the
garden
presently
she
laughed
aloud
what
is
it
polynesia
asked
the
doctor
looking
up
from
his
book
i
was
just
thinking
said
the
parrot
and
she
went
on
looking
at
the
leaves
what
were
you
thinking
i
was
thinking
about
people
said
polynesia
people
make
me
sick
they
think
they
re
so
wonderful
the
world
has
been
going
on
now
for
thousands
of
years
hasn
t
it
and
the
only
thing
in
that
have
learned
to
understand
is
that
when
a
dog
wags
his
tail
he
means
i
m
glad
s
funny
isn
t
it
you
are
the
very
first
man
to
talk
like
us
oh
sometimes
people
annoy
me
airs
they
put
about
the
dumb
why
i
knew
a
macaw
once
who
could
say
good
morning
in
seven
different
ways
without
once
opening
his
mouth
he
could
talk
every
greek
an
old
professor
with
a
gray
beard
bought
him
but
he
didn
t
stay
he
said
the
old
man
didn
t
talk
greek
right
and
he
couldn
t
stand
listening
to
him
teach
the
language
wrong
i
often
wonder
what
s
become
of
him
that
bird
knew
more
geography
than
people
will
ever
golly
i
suppose
if
people
ever
learn
to
any
common
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
it
you
re
a
wise
old
bird
said
the
doctor
how
old
are
you
really
i
know
that
parrots
and
elephants
sometimes
live
to
be
very
very
i
can
never
be
quite
sure
of
my
age
said
polynesia
it
s
either
a
hundred
and
or
a
hundred
and
but
i
know
that
when
i
first
came
here
from
africa
king
charles
was
still
hiding
in
the
i
saw
him
he
looked
scared
to
third
more
money
troubles
and
soon
now
the
doctor
began
to
make
money
again
and
his
sister
sarah
bought
a
new
dress
and
was
happy
some
of
the
animals
who
came
to
see
him
were
so
sick
that
they
had
to
stay
at
the
doctor
s
house
for
a
week
and
when
they
were
getting
better
they
used
to
sit
in
chairs
on
the
lawn
illustration
they
used
to
sit
in
chairs
on
the
lawn
and
often
even
after
they
got
well
they
did
not
want
to
go
liked
the
doctor
and
his
house
so
much
and
he
never
had
the
heart
to
refuse
them
when
they
asked
if
they
could
stay
with
him
so
in
this
way
he
went
on
getting
more
and
more
pets
once
when
he
was
sitting
on
his
garden
wall
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
evening
an
italian
came
round
with
a
monkey
on
a
string
the
doctor
saw
at
once
that
the
monkey
s
collar
was
too
tight
and
that
he
was
dirty
and
unhappy
so
he
took
the
monkey
away
from
the
italian
gave
the
man
a
shilling
and
told
him
to
go
the
got
awfully
angry
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
keep
the
monkey
but
the
doctor
told
him
that
if
he
didn
t
go
away
he
would
punch
him
on
the
nose
john
dolittle
was
a
strong
man
though
he
wasn
t
very
tall
so
the
italian
went
away
saying
rude
things
and
the
monkey
stayed
with
doctor
dolittle
and
had
a
good
home
the
other
animals
in
the
house
called
him
is
a
common
word
in
meaning
and
another
time
when
the
circus
came
to
puddleby
the
crocodile
who
had
a
bad
toothache
escaped
at
night
and
came
into
the
doctor
s
garden
the
doctor
talked
to
him
in
and
took
him
into
the
house
and
made
his
tooth
better
but
when
the
crocodile
saw
what
a
nice
house
it
all
the
different
places
for
the
different
kinds
of
too
wanted
to
live
with
the
doctor
he
asked
couldn
t
he
sleep
in
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
if
he
promised
not
to
eat
the
fish
when
the
came
to
take
him
back
he
got
so
wild
and
savage
that
he
frightened
them
away
but
to
every
one
in
the
house
he
was
always
as
gentle
as
a
kitten
but
now
the
old
ladies
grew
afraid
to
send
their
to
doctor
dolittle
because
of
the
crocodile
and
the
farmers
wouldn
t
believe
that
he
would
not
eat
the
lambs
and
sick
calves
they
brought
to
be
cured
so
the
doctor
went
to
the
crocodile
and
told
him
he
must
go
back
to
his
circus
but
he
wept
such
big
tears
and
begged
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
stay
that
the
doctor
hadn
t
the
heart
to
turn
him
out
so
then
the
doctor
s
sister
came
to
him
and
said
john
you
must
send
that
creature
away
now
the
farmers
and
the
old
ladies
are
afraid
to
send
their
animals
to
as
we
were
beginning
to
be
well
off
again
now
we
shall
be
ruined
entirely
this
is
the
last
straw
i
will
no
longer
be
housekeeper
for
you
if
you
don
t
send
away
that
it
isn
t
an
alligator
said
the
it
s
a
i
don
t
care
what
you
call
it
said
his
sister
it
s
a
nasty
thing
to
find
under
the
bed
i
won
t
have
it
in
the
but
he
has
promised
me
the
doctor
answered
that
he
will
not
bite
any
one
he
doesn
t
like
the
circus
and
i
haven
t
the
money
to
send
him
back
to
africa
where
he
comes
from
he
minds
his
own
business
and
on
the
whole
is
very
well
behaved
don
t
be
so
i
tell
you
i
have
him
around
said
sarah
he
eats
the
linoleum
if
you
don
t
send
him
away
this
minute
i
ll
go
and
get
married
all
right
said
the
doctor
go
and
get
married
it
can
t
be
and
he
took
down
his
hat
and
went
out
into
the
garden
so
sarah
dolittle
packed
up
her
things
and
went
off
and
the
doctor
was
left
all
alone
with
his
animal
family
illustration
all
right
said
the
doctor
go
and
get
married
and
very
soon
he
was
poorer
than
he
had
ever
been
before
with
all
these
mouths
to
fill
and
the
house
to
look
after
and
no
one
to
do
the
mending
and
no
money
coming
in
to
pay
the
butcher
s
bill
things
began
to
look
very
difficult
but
the
doctor
didn
t
worry
at
all
money
is
a
nuisance
he
used
to
say
we
d
all
be
much
better
off
if
it
had
never
been
invented
what
does
money
matter
so
long
as
we
are
happy
illustration
one
evening
when
the
doctor
was
asleep
in
his
chair
but
soon
the
animals
themselves
began
to
get
worried
and
one
evening
when
the
doctor
was
asleep
in
his
chair
before
the
they
began
talking
it
over
among
themselves
in
whispers
and
the
owl
who
was
good
at
arithmetic
figured
it
out
that
there
was
only
money
enough
left
to
last
another
they
each
had
one
meal
a
day
and
no
more
then
the
parrot
said
i
think
we
all
ought
to
do
the
housework
ourselves
at
least
we
can
do
that
much
after
all
it
is
for
our
sakes
that
the
old
man
finds
himself
so
lonely
and
so
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
monkey
was
to
do
the
cooking
and
mending
the
dog
was
to
sweep
the
floors
the
duck
was
to
dust
and
make
the
beds
the
owl
was
to
keep
the
accounts
and
the
pig
was
to
do
the
gardening
they
made
polynesia
the
parrot
housekeeper
and
laundress
because
she
was
the
oldest
of
course
at
first
they
all
found
their
new
jobs
very
hard
to
except
who
had
hands
and
could
do
things
like
a
man
but
they
soon
got
used
to
it
and
they
used
to
think
it
great
fun
to
watch
jip
the
dog
sweeping
his
tail
over
the
floor
with
a
rag
tied
onto
it
for
a
broom
after
a
little
they
got
to
do
the
work
so
well
that
the
doctor
said
that
he
had
never
had
his
house
kept
so
tidy
or
so
clean
before
in
this
way
things
went
along
all
right
for
a
while
but
without
money
they
found
it
very
hard
then
the
animals
made
a
vegetable
and
flower
stall
outside
the
and
sold
radishes
and
roses
to
the
people
that
passed
by
along
the
road
but
still
they
didn
t
seem
to
make
enough
money
to
pay
all
the
still
the
doctor
wouldn
t
worry
when
the
parrot
came
to
him
and
told
him
that
the
fishmonger
wouldn
t
give
them
any
more
fish
he
said
never
mind
so
long
as
the
hens
lay
eggs
and
the
cow
gives
milk
we
can
have
omelettes
and
junket
and
there
are
plenty
of
vegetables
left
in
the
garden
the
winter
is
still
a
long
way
off
don
t
fuss
that
was
the
trouble
with
would
fuss
i
wonder
how
sarah
s
getting
excellent
some
well
but
the
snow
came
earlier
than
usual
that
year
and
although
the
old
lame
horse
hauled
in
plenty
of
wood
from
the
forest
outside
the
town
so
they
could
have
a
big
fire
in
the
kitchen
most
of
the
vegetables
in
the
garden
were
gone
and
the
rest
were
covered
with
snow
and
many
of
the
animals
were
really
hungry
fourth
a
message
from
africa
that
winter
was
a
very
cold
one
and
one
night
in
december
when
they
were
all
sitting
round
the
warm
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
the
doctor
was
reading
aloud
to
them
out
of
books
he
had
written
himself
in
the
owl
suddenly
said
sh
what
s
that
noise
outside
they
all
listened
and
presently
they
heard
the
sound
of
some
one
running
then
the
door
flew
open
and
the
monkey
ran
in
badly
out
of
breath
doctor
he
cried
i
ve
just
had
a
message
from
a
cousin
of
mine
in
africa
there
is
a
terrible
sickness
among
the
monkeys
out
there
they
are
all
catching
they
are
dying
in
hundreds
they
have
heard
of
you
and
beg
you
to
come
to
africa
to
stop
the
who
brought
the
message
asked
the
doctor
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
laying
down
his
book
a
swallow
said
she
is
outside
on
the
bring
her
in
by
the
fire
said
the
doctor
she
must
be
perished
with
the
cold
the
swallows
flew
south
six
weeks
ago
so
the
swallow
was
brought
in
all
huddled
and
shivering
and
although
she
was
a
little
afraid
at
first
she
soon
got
warmed
up
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
and
began
to
talk
when
she
had
finished
the
doctor
said
i
would
gladly
go
to
in
this
bitter
weather
but
i
m
afraid
we
haven
t
money
enough
to
buy
the
tickets
get
me
the
so
the
monkey
climbed
up
and
got
it
off
the
top
shelf
of
the
dresser
there
was
nothing
in
one
single
penny
i
felt
sure
there
was
twopence
left
said
the
doctor
there
said
the
owl
but
you
spent
it
on
a
rattle
for
that
badger
s
baby
when
he
was
did
i
said
the
dear
me
dear
me
what
a
nuisance
money
is
to
be
sure
well
never
mind
perhaps
if
i
go
down
to
the
seaside
i
shall
be
able
to
borrow
a
boat
that
will
take
us
to
africa
i
knew
a
seaman
once
who
brought
his
baby
to
me
with
measles
maybe
he
ll
lend
us
his
baby
got
illustration
i
felt
sure
there
was
twopence
left
so
early
the
next
morning
the
doctor
went
down
to
the
and
when
he
came
back
he
told
the
animals
it
was
all
sailor
was
going
to
lend
them
the
boat
then
the
crocodile
and
the
monkey
and
the
parrot
were
very
glad
and
began
to
sing
because
they
were
going
back
to
africa
their
real
home
and
the
doctor
said
i
shall
only
be
able
to
take
you
jip
the
dog
the
duck
the
pig
and
the
owl
the
rest
of
the
animals
like
the
dormice
and
the
and
the
bats
they
will
have
to
go
back
and
live
in
the
fields
where
they
were
born
till
we
come
home
again
but
as
most
of
them
sleep
through
the
winter
they
won
t
mind
besides
it
wouldn
t
be
good
for
them
to
go
to
so
then
the
parrot
who
had
been
on
long
before
began
telling
the
doctor
all
the
things
he
would
have
to
take
with
him
on
the
ship
you
must
have
plenty
of
she
hard
tack
they
call
it
and
you
must
have
beef
in
an
i
expect
the
ship
will
have
its
own
anchor
said
the
doctor
well
make
sure
said
polynesia
because
it
s
very
important
you
can
t
stop
if
you
haven
t
got
an
anchor
and
you
ll
need
a
what
s
that
for
asked
the
doctor
to
tell
the
time
by
said
the
parrot
you
go
and
ring
it
every
and
then
you
know
what
time
it
is
and
bring
a
whole
lot
of
always
comes
in
handy
on
then
they
began
to
wonder
where
they
were
going
to
get
the
money
from
to
buy
all
the
things
they
needed
oh
bother
it
money
again
cried
the
doctor
goodness
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
to
africa
where
we
don
t
have
to
have
any
i
ll
go
and
ask
the
grocer
if
he
will
wait
for
his
money
till
i
get
i
ll
send
the
sailor
to
ask
so
the
sailor
went
to
see
the
grocer
and
presently
he
came
back
with
all
the
things
they
wanted
then
the
animals
packed
up
and
after
they
had
turned
off
the
water
so
the
pipes
wouldn
t
freeze
and
put
up
the
shutters
they
closed
the
house
and
gave
the
key
to
the
old
horse
who
lived
in
the
stable
and
when
they
had
seen
that
there
was
plenty
of
hay
in
the
loft
to
last
the
horse
through
the
winter
they
carried
all
their
luggage
down
to
the
seashore
and
got
on
to
the
boat
the
cat
was
there
to
see
them
off
and
he
brought
a
large
as
a
present
for
the
doctor
because
he
said
he
had
been
told
you
couldn
t
get
in
foreign
parts
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
ship
the
pig
asked
where
the
beds
were
for
it
was
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
he
wanted
his
nap
so
polynesia
took
him
downstairs
into
the
inside
of
the
ship
and
showed
him
the
beds
set
all
on
top
of
one
another
like
against
a
wall
why
that
isn
t
a
bed
cried
that
s
a
shelf
beds
are
always
like
that
on
ships
said
the
parrot
it
isn
t
a
shelf
climb
up
into
it
and
go
to
sleep
that
s
what
you
call
a
illustration
and
the
voyage
began
i
don
t
think
i
ll
go
to
bed
yet
said
i
m
too
excited
i
want
to
go
upstairs
again
and
see
them
well
this
is
your
first
trip
said
polynesia
you
will
get
used
to
the
life
after
a
and
she
went
back
up
the
stairs
of
the
ship
humming
this
song
to
herself
i
ve
seen
the
black
sea
and
the
red
sea
i
rounded
the
isle
of
wight
i
discovered
the
yellow
river
and
the
orange
night
now
greenland
drops
behind
again
and
i
sail
the
ocean
blue
i
m
tired
of
all
these
colors
jane
so
i
m
coming
back
to
you
they
were
just
going
to
start
on
their
journey
when
the
doctor
said
he
would
have
to
go
back
and
ask
the
sailor
the
way
to
africa
but
the
swallow
said
she
had
been
to
that
country
many
times
and
would
show
them
how
to
get
there
so
the
doctor
told
to
pull
up
the
anchor
and
the
voyage
began
fifth
the
great
journey
now
for
six
whole
weeks
they
went
sailing
on
and
on
over
the
rolling
sea
following
the
swallow
who
flew
before
the
ship
to
show
them
the
way
at
night
she
carried
a
tiny
lantern
so
they
should
not
miss
her
in
the
dark
and
the
people
on
the
other
ships
that
passed
said
that
the
light
must
be
a
shooting
star
as
they
sailed
further
and
further
into
the
south
it
got
warmer
and
warmer
polynesia
and
the
crocodile
enjoyed
the
hot
sun
no
end
they
ran
about
laughing
and
looking
over
the
side
of
the
ship
to
see
if
they
could
see
africa
yet
but
the
pig
and
the
dog
and
the
owl
could
do
nothing
in
such
weather
but
sat
at
the
end
of
the
ship
in
the
shade
of
a
big
barrel
with
their
tongues
hanging
out
drinking
lemonade
the
duck
used
to
keep
herself
cool
by
jumping
into
the
sea
and
swimming
behind
the
ship
and
every
once
in
a
while
when
the
top
of
her
head
got
too
hot
she
would
dive
under
the
ship
and
come
up
on
the
other
side
in
this
way
too
she
used
to
catch
herrings
on
tuesdays
and
everybody
on
the
boat
ate
fish
to
make
the
beef
last
longer
when
they
got
near
to
the
equator
they
saw
some
coming
towards
them
and
the
fishes
asked
the
parrot
if
this
was
doctor
dolittle
s
ship
when
she
told
them
it
was
they
said
they
were
glad
because
the
monkeys
in
africa
were
getting
worried
that
he
would
never
come
polynesia
asked
them
how
many
miles
they
had
yet
to
go
and
the
said
it
was
only
miles
now
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
another
time
a
whole
school
of
porpoises
came
dancing
through
the
waves
and
they
too
asked
polynesia
if
this
was
the
ship
of
the
famous
doctor
and
when
they
heard
that
it
was
they
asked
the
parrot
if
the
doctor
wanted
anything
for
his
journey
and
polynesia
said
yes
we
have
run
short
of
there
is
an
island
not
far
from
here
said
the
porpoises
where
the
wild
onions
grow
tall
and
strong
keep
straight
will
get
some
and
catch
up
to
so
the
porpoises
dashed
away
through
the
sea
and
very
soon
the
parrot
saw
them
again
coming
up
behind
dragging
the
onions
through
the
waves
in
big
nets
made
of
seaweed
the
next
evening
as
the
sun
was
going
down
the
doctor
said
get
me
the
telescope
our
journey
is
nearly
ended
very
soon
we
should
be
able
to
see
the
shores
of
and
about
half
an
hour
later
sure
enough
they
thought
they
could
see
something
in
front
that
might
be
land
but
it
began
to
get
darker
and
darker
and
they
couldn
t
be
sure
then
a
great
storm
came
up
with
thunder
and
lightning
the
wind
howled
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
the
waves
got
so
high
they
splashed
right
over
the
boat
presently
there
was
a
big
bang
the
ship
stopped
and
rolled
over
on
its
side
what
s
happened
asked
the
doctor
coming
up
from
downstairs
i
m
not
sure
said
the
parrot
but
i
think
we
re
tell
the
duck
to
get
out
and
so
dived
right
down
under
the
waves
and
when
she
came
up
she
said
they
had
struck
a
rock
there
was
a
big
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
ship
the
water
was
coming
in
and
they
were
sinking
fast
we
must
have
run
into
africa
said
the
doctor
dear
me
dear
me
must
all
swim
to
but
and
did
not
know
how
to
swim
get
the
rope
said
polynesia
i
told
you
it
would
come
in
handy
where
s
that
duck
come
here
take
this
end
of
the
rope
fly
to
the
shore
and
tie
it
on
to
a
and
we
ll
hold
the
other
end
on
the
ship
here
then
those
that
can
t
swim
must
climb
along
the
rope
till
they
reach
the
land
that
s
what
you
call
a
illustration
we
must
have
run
into
africa
so
they
all
got
safely
to
the
swimming
some
flying
and
those
that
climbed
along
the
rope
brought
the
doctor
s
trunk
and
with
them
but
the
ship
was
no
good
any
the
big
hole
in
the
bottom
and
presently
the
rough
sea
beat
it
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
and
the
timbers
floated
away
then
they
all
took
shelter
in
a
nice
dry
cave
they
found
high
up
in
the
cliffs
till
the
storm
was
over
when
the
sun
came
out
next
morning
they
went
down
to
the
sandy
beach
to
dry
themselves
dear
old
africa
sighed
polynesia
it
s
good
to
get
back
just
ll
be
a
hundred
and
years
since
i
was
here
and
it
hasn
t
changed
a
bit
old
same
old
red
earth
same
old
black
ants
there
s
no
place
like
home
and
the
others
noticed
she
had
tears
in
her
was
so
pleased
to
see
her
country
once
again
then
the
doctor
missed
his
high
hat
for
it
had
been
blown
into
the
sea
during
the
storm
so
went
out
to
look
for
it
and
presently
she
saw
it
a
long
way
off
floating
on
the
water
like
a
when
she
flew
down
to
get
it
she
found
one
of
the
white
mice
very
frightened
sitting
inside
it
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
duck
you
were
told
to
stay
behind
in
i
didn
t
want
to
be
left
behind
said
the
mouse
i
wanted
to
see
what
africa
was
have
relatives
there
so
i
hid
in
the
baggage
and
was
brought
on
to
the
ship
with
the
when
the
ship
sank
i
was
terribly
i
can
not
swim
far
i
swam
as
long
as
i
could
but
i
soon
got
all
exhausted
and
thought
i
was
going
to
sink
and
then
just
at
that
moment
the
old
man
s
hat
came
floating
by
and
i
got
into
it
because
i
did
not
want
to
be
so
the
duck
took
up
the
hat
with
the
mouse
in
it
and
brought
it
to
the
doctor
on
the
shore
and
they
all
gathered
round
to
have
a
look
that
s
what
you
call
a
stowaway
said
the
parrot
presently
when
they
were
looking
for
a
place
in
the
trunk
where
the
white
mouse
could
travel
comfortably
the
monkey
suddenly
said
sh
i
hear
footsteps
in
the
jungle
they
all
stopped
talking
and
listened
and
soon
a
black
man
came
down
out
of
the
woods
and
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
there
illustration
i
got
into
it
because
i
did
not
want
to
be
drowned
my
name
is
john
said
the
doctor
i
have
been
asked
to
come
to
africa
to
cure
the
monkeys
who
are
you
must
all
come
before
the
king
said
the
black
man
what
king
asked
the
doctor
who
didn
t
want
to
waste
any
time
the
king
of
the
jolliginki
the
man
answered
all
these
lands
belong
to
him
and
all
strangers
must
be
brought
before
him
follow
so
they
gathered
up
their
baggage
and
went
off
following
the
man
through
the
jungle
sixth
polynesia
and
the
king
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
through
the
thick
forest
they
came
to
a
wide
clear
space
and
they
saw
the
king
s
palace
which
was
made
of
mud
this
was
where
the
king
lived
with
his
queen
ermintrude
and
their
son
prince
bumpo
the
prince
was
away
fishing
for
salmon
in
the
river
but
the
king
and
queen
were
sitting
under
an
umbrella
before
the
palace
door
and
queen
ermintrude
was
asleep
when
the
doctor
had
come
up
to
the
palace
the
king
asked
him
his
business
and
the
doctor
told
him
why
he
had
come
to
africa
you
may
not
travel
through
my
lands
said
the
king
many
years
ago
a
white
man
came
to
these
shores
and
i
was
very
kind
to
him
but
after
he
had
dug
holes
in
the
ground
to
get
the
gold
and
killed
all
the
elephants
to
get
their
ivory
tusks
he
went
away
secretly
in
his
without
so
much
as
saying
thank
never
again
shall
a
white
man
travel
through
the
lands
of
illustration
and
queen
ermintrude
was
asleep
then
the
king
turned
to
some
of
the
black
men
who
were
standing
near
and
said
take
away
this
all
his
animals
and
lock
them
up
in
my
strongest
so
six
of
the
black
men
led
the
doctor
and
all
his
pets
away
and
shut
them
up
in
a
stone
dungeon
the
dungeon
had
only
one
little
window
high
up
in
the
wall
with
bars
in
it
and
the
door
was
strong
and
thick
then
they
all
grew
very
sad
and
the
pig
began
to
cry
but
said
he
would
spank
him
if
he
didn
t
stop
that
horrible
noise
and
he
kept
quiet
are
we
all
here
asked
the
doctor
after
he
had
got
used
to
the
dim
light
yes
i
think
so
said
the
duck
and
started
to
count
them
where
s
polynesia
asked
the
crocodile
she
isn
t
are
you
sure
said
the
doctor
look
again
polynesia
polynesia
where
are
you
i
suppose
she
escaped
grumbled
the
crocodile
well
that
s
just
like
her
off
into
the
jungle
as
soon
as
her
friends
got
into
i
m
not
that
kind
of
a
bird
said
the
parrot
climbing
out
of
the
pocket
in
the
tail
of
the
doctor
s
coat
you
see
i
m
small
enough
to
get
through
the
bars
of
that
window
and
i
was
afraid
they
would
put
me
in
a
cage
instead
so
while
the
king
was
busy
talking
i
hid
in
the
doctor
s
here
i
am
that
s
what
you
call
a
ruse
she
said
smoothing
down
her
feathers
with
her
beak
good
gracious
cried
the
doctor
you
re
lucky
i
didn
t
sit
on
now
listen
said
polynesia
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
i
am
going
to
creep
through
the
bars
of
that
window
and
fly
over
to
the
palace
and
ll
ll
soon
find
a
way
to
make
the
king
let
us
all
out
of
oh
what
can
do
said
turning
up
his
nose
and
beginning
to
cry
again
you
re
only
a
bird
quite
true
said
the
parrot
but
do
not
forget
that
although
i
am
only
a
bird
can
talk
like
a
i
know
these
so
that
night
when
the
moon
was
shining
through
the
and
all
the
king
s
men
were
asleep
the
parrot
slipped
out
through
the
bars
of
the
prison
and
flew
across
to
the
palace
the
pantry
window
had
been
broken
by
a
tennis
ball
the
week
before
and
polynesia
popped
in
through
the
hole
in
the
glass
she
heard
prince
bumpo
snoring
in
his
bedroom
at
the
back
of
the
palace
then
she
up
the
stairs
till
she
came
to
the
king
s
bedroom
she
opened
the
door
gently
and
peeped
in
the
queen
was
away
at
a
dance
that
night
at
her
cousin
s
but
the
king
was
in
bed
fast
asleep
polynesia
crept
in
very
softly
and
got
under
the
bed
then
she
the
way
doctor
dolittle
used
to
cough
polynesia
could
mimic

the
king
opened
his
eyes
and
said
sleepily
is

he
thought
it
was
the
queen
come
back
from
the
dance
then
the
parrot
coughed
like
a
man
and
the
king
sat
up
wide
awake
and
said

the
the
way
the
doctor

the
king
how

at
once
so

the
king
foolish

answered
polynesia

to

wonderful
man
on

of

little
finger
send

once
to
open
the
dungeon
door
or
you
shall
have
mumps
before
the
morning
sun
has
risen
on
the
hills
of
then
the
king
began
to
tremble
and
was
very
much
afraid
doctor
he
cried
it
shall
be
as
you
say
do
not
raise
your
little
finger
please
and
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
tell
the
soldiers
to
open
the
prison
door
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
polynesia
crept
downstairs
and
left
the
palace
by
the
pantry
window
but
the
queen
who
was
just
letting
herself
in
at
the
backdoor
with
a
saw
the
parrot
getting
out
through
the
broken
glass
and
when
the
king
came
back
to
bed
she
told
him
what
she
had
seen
then
the
king
understood
that
he
had
been
tricked
and
he
was
dreadfully
angry
he
hurried
back
to
the
prison
at
once
but
he
was
too
late
the
door
stood
open
the
dungeon
was
empty
the
doctor
and
all
his
animals
were
gone
seventh
the
bridge
of
apes
queen
ermintrude
had
never
in
her
life
seen
her
husband
so
terrible
as
he
got
that
night
he
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
he
called
everybody
a
fool
he
threw
his
at
the
palace
cat
he
rushed
round
in
his
and
woke
up
all
his
army
and
sent
them
into
the
jungle
to
catch
the
doctor
then
he
made
all
his
servants
go
cooks
and
his
gardeners
and
his
barber
and
prince
bumpo
s
the
queen
who
was
tired
from
dancing
in
a
pair
of
tight
shoes
was
packed
off
to
help
the
soldiers
in
their
search
all
this
time
the
doctor
and
his
animals
were
running
through
the
forest
towards
the
land
of
the
monkeys
as
fast
as
they
could
go
with
his
short
legs
soon
got
tired
and
the
doctor
had
to
carry
made
it
pretty
hard
when
they
had
the
trunk
and
the
with
them
as
well
the
king
of
the
jolliginki
thought
it
would
be
easy
for
his
army
to
find
them
because
the
doctor
was
in
a
strange
land
and
would
not
know
his
way
but
he
was
wrong
because
the
monkey
knew
all
the
paths
through
the
even
than
the
king
s
men
did
and
he
led
the
doctor
and
his
pets
to
the
very
thickest
part
of
the
place
where
no
man
had
ever
been
hid
them
all
in
a
big
hollow
tree
between
high
rocks
we
had
better
wait
here
said
till
the
soldiers
have
gone
back
to
bed
then
we
can
go
on
into
the
land
of
the
so
there
they
stayed
the
whole
night
through
they
often
heard
the
king
s
men
searching
and
talking
in
the
jungle
round
about
but
they
were
quite
safe
for
no
one
knew
of
that
but
even
the
other
monkeys
at
last
when
daylight
began
to
come
through
the
thick
leaves
overhead
they
heard
queen
ermintrude
saying
in
a
very
tired
voice
that
it
was
no
use
looking
any
they
might
as
well
go
back
and
get
some
sleep
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
had
all
gone
home
brought
the
doctor
and
his
animals
out
of
the
and
they
set
off
for
the
land
of
the
monkeys
it
was
a
long
long
way
and
they
often
got
very
but
when
he
cried
they
gave
him
milk
out
of
the
cocoanuts
which
he
was
very
fond
of
they
always
had
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
because
and
polynesia
knew
all
the
different
kinds
of
fruits
and
vegetables
that
grow
in
the
jungle
and
where
to
find
dates
and
figs
and
and
ginger
and
yams
they
used
to
make
their
lemonade
out
of
the
juice
of
wild
oranges
sweetened
with
honey
which
they
got
from
the
bees
nests
in
hollow
trees
no
matter
what
it
was
they
asked
for
and
polynesia
always
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
it
for
something
like
it
they
even
got
the
doctor
some
tobacco
one
day
when
he
had
finished
what
he
had
brought
with
him
and
wanted
to
smoke
at
night
they
slept
in
tents
made
of
on
thick
soft
beds
of
dried
grass
and
after
a
while
they
got
used
to
walking
such
a
lot
and
did
not
get
so
tired
and
enjoyed
the
life
of
travel
very
much
but
they
were
always
glad
when
the
night
came
and
they
stopped
for
their
then
the
doctor
used
to
make
a
little
fire
of
sticks
and
after
they
had
had
their
supper
they
would
sit
round
it
in
a
ring
listening
to
polynesia
singing
songs
about
the
sea
or
to
telling
stories
of
the
jungle
and
many
of
the
tales
that
told
were
very
interesting
because
although
the
monkeys
had
no
of
their
own
before
doctor
dolittle
came
to
write
them
for
them
they
remember
everything
that
happens
by
telling
stories
to
their
children
and
spoke
of
many
things
his
grandmother
had
told
of
long
long
long
ago
before
noah
and
the
flood
the
days
when
men
dressed
in
and
lived
in
holes
in
the
rock
and
ate
their
mutton
raw
because
they
did
not
know
what
cooking
never
seen
a
fire
and
he
told
them
of
the
great
mammoths
and
lizards
as
long
as
a
train
that
wandered
over
the
mountains
in
those
times
nibbling
from
the
and
often
they
got
so
interested
listening
that
when
he
had
finished
they
found
their
fire
had
gone
right
out
and
they
had
to
scurry
round
to
get
more
sticks
and
build
a
new
one
now
when
the
king
s
army
had
gone
back
and
told
the
king
that
they
couldn
t
find
the
doctor
the
king
sent
them
out
again
and
told
them
they
must
stay
in
the
jungle
till
they
caught
him
so
all
this
time
while
the
doctor
and
his
animals
were
going
along
towards
the
land
of
the
monkeys
thinking
themselves
quite
safe
they
were
still
being
followed
by
the
king
s
men
if
had
known
this
he
would
most
likely
have
hidden
them
again
but
he
didn
t
know
it
one
day
climbed
up
a
high
rock
and
looked
out
over
the
and
when
he
came
down
he
said
they
were
now
quite
close
to
the
land
of
the
monkeys
and
would
soon
be
there
and
that
same
evening
sure
enough
they
saw
s
cousin
and
a
lot
of
other
monkeys
who
had
not
yet
got
sick
sitting
in
the
trees
by
the
edge
of
a
swamp
looking
and
waiting
for
them
and
when
they
saw
the
famous
doctor
really
come
these
monkeys
made
a
tremendous
noise
cheering
and
waving
leaves
and
swinging
out
of
the
branches
to
greet
him
they
wanted
to
carry
his
bag
and
his
trunk
and
everything
he
one
of
the
bigger
ones
even
carried
who
had
got
tired
again
then
two
of
them
rushed
on
in
front
to
tell
the
sick
monkeys
that
the
great
doctor
had
come
at
last
but
the
king
s
men
who
were
still
following
had
heard
the
noise
of
the
monkeys
cheering
and
they
at
last
knew
where
the
doctor
was
and
hastened
on
to
catch
him
the
big
monkey
carrying
was
coming
along
behind
slowly
and
he
saw
the
captain
of
the
army
sneaking
through
the
trees
so
he
hurried
after
the
doctor
and
told
him
to
run
illustration
cheering
and
waving
leaves
and
swinging
out
of
the
branches
to
greet
him
then
they
all
ran
harder
than
they
had
ever
run
in
their
lives
and
the
king
s
men
coming
after
them
began
to
run
too
and
the
captain
ran
hardest
of
all
then
the
doctor
tripped
over
his
and
fell
down
in
the
mud
and
the
captain
thought
he
would
surely
catch
him
this
time
but
the
captain
had
very
long
his
hair
was
very
short
and
as
he
sprang
forward
to
take
hold
of
the
doctor
one
of
his
ears
caught
fast
in
a
tree
and
the
rest
of
the
army
had
to
stop
and
help
him
by
this
time
the
doctor
had
picked
himself
up
and
on
they
went
again
running
and
running
and
shouted
it
s
all
right
we
haven
t
far
to
go
now
but
before
they
could
get
into
the
land
of
the
monkeys
they
came
to
a
steep
cliff
with
a
river
flowing
below
this
was
the
end
of
the
kingdom
of
jolliginki
and
the
land
of
the
monkeys
was
on
the
other
the
river
and
jip
the
dog
looked
down
over
the
edge
of
the
steep
steep
cliff
and
said
golly
how
are
we
ever
going
to
get
across
oh
dear
said
the
king
s
men
are
quite
close
at
them
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
to
be
taken
back
to
prison
and
he
began
to
weep
but
the
big
monkey
who
was
carrying
the
pig
dropped
him
on
the
ground
and
cried
out
to
the
other
monkeys
bridge
quick
a
bridge
we
ve
only
a
minute
to
do
it
they
ve
got
the
captain
loose
and
he
s
coming
on
like
a
deer
get
lively
a
bridge
a
bridge
the
doctor
began
to
wonder
what
they
were
going
to
make
a
bridge
out
of
and
he
gazed
around
to
see
if
they
had
any
boards
hidden
any
place
but
when
he
looked
back
at
the
cliff
there
hanging
across
the
river
was
a
bridge
all
ready
for
of
living
monkeys
for
while
his
back
was
turned
the
as
a
made
themselves
into
a
bridge
just
by
holding
hands
and
feet
and
the
big
one
shouted
to
the
doctor
walk
over
walk
of
was
a
bit
scared
walking
on
such
a
narrow
bridge
at
that
dizzy
height
above
the
river
but
he
got
over
all
right
and
so
did
all
of
them
john
dolittle
was
the
last
to
cross
and
just
as
he
was
getting
to
the
other
side
the
king
s
men
came
rushing
up
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
then
they
shook
their
fists
and
yelled
with
rage
for
they
saw
they
were
too
late
the
doctor
and
all
his
animals
were
safe
in
the
land
of
the
monkeys
and
the
bridge
was
pulled
across
to
the
other
side
then
turned
to
the
doctor
and
said
many
great
explorers
and
naturalists
have
lain
long
weeks
hidden
in
the
jungle
waiting
to
see
the
monkeys
do
that
trick
but
we
never
let
a
white
man
get
a
glimpse
of
it
before
you
are
the
first
to
see
the
famous
bridge
of
and
the
doctor
felt
very
pleased
illustration
john
dolittle
was
the
last
to
cross
eighth
the
leader
of
the
lions
john
dolittle
now
became
dreadfully
awfully
busy
he
found
hundreds
and
thousands
of
monkeys
chimpanzees
baboons
marmosettes
gray
monkeys
red
kinds
and
many
had
died
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
separate
the
sick
ones
from
the
well
ones
then
he
got
and
his
cousin
to
build
him
a
little
house
of
grass
the
next
thing
he
made
all
the
monkeys
who
were
still
well
come
and
be
vaccinated
and
for
three
days
and
three
nights
the
monkeys
kept
coming
from
the
jungles
and
the
valleys
and
the
hills
to
the
little
house
of
grass
where
the
doctor
sat
all
day
and
all
night
vaccinating
and
vaccinating
illustration
he
made
all
the
monkeys
who
were
still
well
come
and
be
vaccinated
then
he
had
another
house
big
one
with
a
lot
of
beds
in
it
and
he
put
all
the
sick
ones
in
this
house
but
so
many
were
sick
there
were
not
enough
well
ones
to
do
the
nursing
so
he
sent
messages
to
the
other
animals
like
the
lions
and
the
leopards
and
the
antelopes
to
come
and
help
with
the
nursing
but
the
leader
of
the
lions
was
a
very
proud
creature
and
when
he
came
to
the
doctor
s
big
house
full
of
beds
he
seemed
angry
and
scornful
do
you
dare
to
ask
me
sir
he
said
glaring
at
the
doctor
do
you
dare
to
ask
the
king
of
to
wait
on
a
lot
of
dirty
monkeys
why
i
wouldn
t
even
eat
them
between
meals
although
the
lion
looked
very
terrible
the
doctor
tried
hard
not
to
seem
afraid
of
him
i
didn
t
ask
you
to
eat
them
he
said
quietly
and
besides
they
re
not
dirty
they
ve
all
had
a
bath
this
morning
coat
looks
as
though
it
needed
now
listen
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
the
day
may
come
when
the
lions
get
sick
and
if
you
don
t
help
the
other
animals
now
the
lions
may
find
themselves
left
all
alone
when
are
in
trouble
that
often
happens
to
proud
illustration
the
king
of
to
wait
on
a
lot
of
dirty
monkeys
the
lions
are
never
only
trouble
said
the
leader
turning
up
his
nose
and
he
stalked
away
into
the
jungle
feeling
he
had
been
rather
smart
and
clever
then
the
leopards
got
proud
too
and
said
they
wouldn
t
help
and
then
of
course
the
they
were
too
shy
and
timid
to
be
rude
to
the
doctor
like
the
pawed
the
ground
and
smiled
foolishly
and
said
they
had
never
been
nurses
before
and
now
the
poor
doctor
was
worried
frantic
wondering
where
he
could
get
help
enough
to
take
care
of
all
these
thousands
of
monkeys
in
bed
but
the
leader
of
the
lions
when
he
got
back
to
his
den
saw
his
wife
the
queen
lioness
come
running
out
to
meet
him
with
her
hair
untidy
one
of
the
cubs
won
t
eat
she
said
i
don
t
know
to
do
with
him
he
hasn
t
taken
a
thing
since
last
and
she
began
to
cry
and
shake
with
she
was
a
good
mother
even
though
she
was
a
lioness
so
the
leader
went
into
his
den
and
looked
at
his
very
cunning
little
cubs
lying
on
the
floor
and
one
of
them
seemed
quite
poorly
then
the
lion
told
his
wife
quite
proudly
just
what
he
had
said
to
the
doctor
and
she
got
so
angry
she
nearly
drove
him
out
of
the
den
you
never
have
a
grain
of
sense
she
screamed
all
the
animals
from
here
to
the
indian
ocean
are
talking
about
this
wonderful
man
and
how
he
can
cure
any
kind
of
sickness
and
how
kind
he
only
man
in
the
whole
world
who
can
talk
the
language
of
the
animals
and
now
we
have
a
sick
baby
on
our
hands
you
must
go
and
offend
him
you
great
booby
nobody
but
a
fool
is
ever
rude
to
a
doctor
and
she
started
pulling
her
husband
s
hair
go
back
to
that
white
man
at
once
she
yelled
and
tell
him
you
re
sorry
and
take
all
the
other
lions
with
those
stupid
leopards
and
antelopes
then
do
everything
the
doctor
tells
you
work
like
niggers
and
perhaps
he
will
be
kind
enough
to
come
and
see
the
cub
later
now
be
off
i
tell
you
you
re
not
fit
to
be
a
father
and
she
went
into
the
den
next
door
where
another
lived
and
told
her
all
about
it
so
the
leader
of
the
lions
went
back
to
the
doctor
and
said
i
happened
to
be
passing
this
way
and
thought
i
d
look
in
got
any
help
yet
no
said
the
doctor
i
haven
t
and
i
m
dreadfully
help
s
pretty
hard
to
get
these
days
said
the
lion
animals
don
t
seem
to
want
to
work
any
more
you
can
t
blame
a
way
well
seeing
you
re
in
difficulties
i
don
t
mind
doing
what
i
to
oblige
long
as
i
don
t
have
to
wash
the
creatures
and
i
have
told
all
the
other
hunting
animals
to
come
and
do
their
share
the
leopards
should
be
here
any
minute
now
oh
and
by
the
way
we
ve
got
a
sick
cub
at
home
i
don
t
think
there
s
much
the
matter
with
him
myself
but
the
wife
is
anxious
if
you
are
around
that
way
this
evening
you
might
take
a
look
at
him
will
you
then
the
doctor
was
very
happy
for
all
the
lions
and
the
leopards
and
the
antelopes
and
the
giraffes
and
the
the
animals
of
the
forests
and
the
mountains
and
the
to
help
him
in
his
work
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
he
had
to
send
some
away
and
only
kept
the
cleverest
and
now
very
soon
the
monkeys
began
to
get
better
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
big
house
full
of
beds
were
half
empty
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
the
last
monkey
had
got
well
then
the
doctor
s
work
was
done
and
he
was
so
tired
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
for
three
days
without
even
turning
over
ninth
the
monkeys
council
stood
outside
the
doctor
s
door
keeping
everybody
away
till
he
woke
up
then
john
dolittle
told
the
monkeys
that
he
must
now
go
back
to
puddleby
they
were
very
surprised
at
this
for
they
had
thought
that
he
was
going
to
stay
with
them
forever
and
that
night
all
the
monkeys
got
together
in
the
jungle
to
talk
it
over
and
the
chief
chimpanzee
rose
up
and
said
why
is
it
the
good
man
is
going
away
is
he
not
happy
here
with
us
but
none
of
them
could
answer
him
then
the
grand
gorilla
got
up
and
said
i
think
we
all
should
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
stay
perhaps
if
we
make
him
a
new
house
and
a
bigger
bed
and
promise
him
plenty
of
to
work
for
him
and
to
make
life
pleasant
for
then
he
will
not
wish
to
then
got
up
and
all
the
others
whispered
sh
look
the
great
traveler
is
about
to
speak
and
said
to
the
other
monkeys
my
friends
i
am
afraid
it
is
useless
to
ask
the
doctor
to
stay
he
owes
money
in
puddleby
and
he
says
he
must
go
back
and
pay
and
the
monkeys
asked
him
what
is
illustration
then
the
grand
gorilla
got
up
then
told
them
that
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
you
could
get
nothing
without
money
you
could
nothing
without
it
was
almost
impossible
to
without
money
and
some
of
them
asked
but
can
you
not
even
eat
and
drink
without
paying
but
shook
his
head
and
then
he
told
them
that
even
he
when
he
was
with
the
had
been
made
to
ask
the
children
for
money
and
the
chief
chimpanzee
turned
to
the
oldest
and
said
cousin
surely
these
men
be
strange
creatures
who
would
wish
to
live
in
such
a
land
my
gracious
how
paltry
then
said
when
we
were
coming
to
you
we
had
no
boat
to
cross
the
sea
in
and
no
money
to
buy
food
to
eat
on
our
journey
so
a
man
lent
us
some
biscuits
and
we
said
we
would
pay
him
when
we
came
back
and
we
borrowed
a
boat
from
a
sailor
but
it
was
broken
on
the
rocks
when
we
reached
the
shores
of
africa
now
the
doctor
says
he
must
go
back
and
get
the
sailor
another
the
man
was
poor
and
his
ship
was
all
he
and
the
monkeys
were
all
silent
for
a
while
sitting
quite
still
upon
the
ground
and
thinking
hard
at
last
the
biggest
baboon
got
up
and
said
i
do
not
think
we
ought
to
let
this
good
man
leave
our
land
till
we
have
given
him
a
fine
present
to
take
with
him
so
that
he
may
know
we
are
grateful
for
all
that
he
has
done
for
and
a
little
tiny
red
monkey
who
was
sitting
up
in
a
tree
shouted
down
i
think
that
too
and
then
they
all
cried
out
making
a
great
noise
yes
yes
let
us
give
him
the
finest
present
a
white
man
ever
had
now
they
began
to
wonder
and
ask
one
another
what
would
be
the
best
thing
to
give
him
and
one
said
fifty
bags
of
cocoanuts
and
a
hundred
bunches
of
bananas
least
he
shall
not
have
to
buy
his
fruit
in
the
land
where
you
pay
to
eat
but
told
them
that
all
these
things
would
be
too
heavy
to
carry
so
far
and
would
go
bad
before
half
was
eaten
if
you
want
to
please
him
he
said
give
him
an
animal
you
may
be
sure
he
will
be
kind
to
it
give
him
some
rare
animal
they
have
not
got
in
the
and
the
monkeys
asked
him
what
are
then
explained
to
them
that
menageries
were
places
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
where
animals
were
put
in
cages
for
people
to
come
and
look
at
and
the
monkeys
were
very
shocked
and
said
to
one
another
these
men
are
like
thoughtless
young
and
easily
amused
sh
it
is
a
prison
he
so
then
they
asked
what
rare
animal
it
could
be
that
they
should
give
the
the
white
men
had
not
seen
before
and
the
major
of
the
marmosettes
asked
have
they
an
iguana
over
there
but
said
yes
there
is
one
in
the
london
and
another
asked
have
they
an
okapi
but
said
yes
in
belgium
where
my
took
me
five
years
ago
they
had
an
okapi
in
a
big
city
they
call
and
another
asked
have
they
a
then
said
no
no
white
man
has
ever
seen
a
let
us
give
him
tenth
the
rarest
animal
of
all
are
now
extinct
that
means
there
aren
t
any
more
but
long
ago
when
doctor
dolittle
was
alive
there
were
some
of
them
still
left
in
the
deepest
jungles
of
africa
and
even
then
they
were
very
very
scarce
they
had
no
tail
but
a
head
at
each
end
and
sharp
horns
on
each
head
they
were
very
shy
and
terribly
hard
to
catch
the
black
men
get
most
of
their
animals
by
sneaking
up
behind
them
while
they
are
not
looking
but
you
could
not
do
this
with
the
no
matter
which
way
you
came
towards
him
he
was
always
facing
you
and
besides
only
one
half
of
him
slept
at
a
time
the
other
head
was
always
watching
this
was
why
they
were
never
caught
and
never
seen
in
zoos
though
many
of
the
greatest
huntsmen
and
the
cleverest
spent
years
of
their
lives
searching
through
the
jungles
in
all
weathers
for
not
a
single
one
had
ever
been
caught
even
then
years
ago
he
was
the
only
animal
in
the
world
with
two
heads
well
the
monkeys
set
out
hunting
for
this
animal
through
the
forest
and
after
they
had
gone
a
good
many
miles
one
of
them
found
peculiar
footprints
near
the
edge
of
a
river
and
they
knew
that
a
must
be
very
near
that
spot
then
they
went
along
the
bank
of
the
river
a
little
way
and
they
saw
a
place
where
the
grass
was
high
and
thick
and
they
guessed
that
he
was
in
there
so
they
all
joined
hands
and
made
a
great
circle
round
the
high
grass
the
heard
them
coming
and
he
tried
hard
to
break
through
the
ring
of
monkeys
but
he
couldn
t
do
it
when
he
saw
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
escape
he
sat
down
and
waited
to
see
what
they
wanted
they
asked
him
if
he
would
go
with
doctor
dolittle
and
be
put
on
show
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
but
he
shook
both
his
heads
hard
and
said
certainly
not
they
explained
to
him
that
he
would
not
be
shut
up
in
a
menagerie
but
would
just
be
looked
at
they
told
him
that
the
doctor
was
a
very
kind
man
but
hadn
t
any
money
and
people
would
pay
to
see
a
animal
and
the
doctor
would
get
rich
and
could
pay
for
the
boat
he
had
borrowed
to
come
to
africa
in
but
he
answered
no
you
know
how
shy
i
hate
being
stared
and
he
almost
began
to
cry
then
for
three
days
they
tried
to
persuade
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
he
said
he
would
come
with
them
and
see
what
kind
of
a
man
the
doctor
was
first
so
the
monkeys
traveled
back
with
the
and
when
they
came
to
where
the
doctor
s
little
house
of
grass
was
they
knocked
on
the
door
the
duck
who
was
packing
the
trunk
said
come
in
and
very
proudly
took
the
animal
inside
and
showed
him
to
the
doctor
what
in
the
world
is
it
asked
john
dolittle
gazing
at
the
strange
creature
lord
save
us
cried
the
duck
how
does
it
make
up
its
mind
it
doesn
t
look
to
me
as
though
it
had
any
said
jip
the
dog
this
doctor
said
is
the
rarest
animal
of
the
african
jungles
the
only
beast
in
the
world
take
him
home
with
you
and
your
fortune
s
made
people
will
pay
any
money
to
see
but
i
don
t
want
any
money
said
the
doctor
yes
you
do
said
the
duck
don
t
you
remember
how
we
had
to
pinch
and
scrape
to
pay
the
butcher
s
bill
in
puddleby
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
the
sailor
the
new
boat
you
spoke
we
have
the
money
to
buy
it
illustration
lord
save
us
cried
the
duck
how
does
it
make
up
its
mind
i
was
going
to
make
him
one
said
the
doctor
oh
do
be
sensible
cried
where
would
you
get
all
the
wood
and
the
nails
to
make
one
with
besides
what
are
we
going
to
live
on
we
shall
be
poorer
than
ever
when
we
get
back
s
perfectly
right
take
the
thing
along
do
well
perhaps
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
murmured
the
doctor
it
certainly
would
make
a
nice
new
kind
of
pet
but
does
the
really
want
to
go
abroad
yes
i
ll
go
said
the
who
saw
at
once
from
the
doctor
s
face
that
he
was
a
man
to
be
trusted
you
have
been
so
kind
to
the
animals
the
monkeys
tell
me
that
i
am
the
only
one
who
will
do
but
you
must
promise
me
that
if
i
do
not
like
it
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
you
will
send
me
why
course
of
course
said
the
doctor
excuse
me
surely
you
are
related
to
the
deer
family
are
you
not
yes
said
the
to
the
abyssinian
gazelles
and
the
asiatic
my
mother
s
side
my
father
s
was
the
last
of
the
most
interesting
murmured
the
doctor
and
he
took
a
book
out
of
the
trunk
which
was
packing
and
began
turning
the
pages
let
us
see
if
buffon
says
i
notice
said
the
duck
that
you
only
talk
with
one
of
your
mouths
can
t
the
other
head
talk
as
well
oh
yes
said
the
but
i
keep
the
other
mouth
for
in
that
way
i
can
talk
while
i
am
eating
without
being
rude
our
people
have
always
been
very
when
the
packing
was
finished
and
everything
was
ready
to
start
the
monkeys
gave
a
grand
party
for
the
doctor
and
all
the
animals
of
the
jungle
came
and
they
had
pineapples
and
mangoes
and
honey
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
after
they
had
all
finished
eating
the
doctor
got
up
and
said
my
friends
i
am
not
clever
at
speaking
long
words
after
dinner
like
some
men
and
i
have
just
eaten
many
fruits
and
much
honey
but
i
wish
to
tell
you
that
i
am
very
sad
at
leaving
your
beautiful
country
because
i
have
things
to
do
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
i
must
go
after
i
have
gone
remember
never
to
let
the
flies
settle
on
your
food
before
you
eat
it
and
do
not
sleep
on
the
ground
when
the
rains
are
coming
hope
you
will
all
live
happily
ever
when
the
doctor
stopped
speaking
and
sat
down
all
the
monkeys
clapped
their
hands
a
long
time
and
said
to
one
another
let
it
be
remembered
always
among
our
people
that
he
sat
and
ate
with
us
here
under
the
trees
for
surely
he
is
the
greatest
of
men
and
the
grand
gorilla
who
had
the
strength
of
seven
horses
in
his
hairy
arms
rolled
a
great
rock
up
to
the
head
of
the
table
and
said
this
stone
for
all
time
shall
mark
the
and
even
to
this
day
in
the
heart
of
the
jungle
that
stone
still
is
there
and
passing
through
the
forest
with
their
families
still
point
down
at
it
from
the
branches
and
whisper
to
their
children
sh
there
it
the
good
white
man
sat
and
ate
food
with
us
in
the
year
of
the
great
sickness
then
when
the
party
was
over
the
doctor
and
his
pets
started
out
to
go
back
to
the
seashore
and
all
the
monkeys
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
edge
of
their
country
carrying
his
trunk
and
bags
to
see
him
off
eleventh
the
black
prince
by
the
edge
of
the
river
they
stopped
and
said
farewell
this
took
a
long
time
because
all
those
thousands
of
monkeys
wanted
to
shake
john
dolittle
by
the
hand
afterwards
when
the
doctor
and
his
pets
were
going
on
alone
polynesia
said
we
must
tread
softly
and
talk
low
as
we
go
through
the
land
of
the
jolliginki
if
the
king
should
hear
us
he
will
send
his
soldiers
to
catch
us
again
for
i
am
sure
he
is
still
very
angry
over
the
trick
i
played
on
what
i
am
wondering
said
the
doctor
is
where
we
are
going
to
get
another
boat
to
go
home
in
oh
well
perhaps
we
ll
find
one
lying
about
on
the
beach
that
nobody
is
using
never
lift
your
foot
till
you
come
to
the
one
day
while
they
were
passing
through
a
very
thick
part
of
the
forest
went
ahead
of
them
to
look
for
cocoanuts
and
while
he
was
away
the
doctor
and
the
rest
of
the
animals
who
did
not
know
the
so
well
got
lost
in
the
deep
woods
they
wandered
around
and
around
but
could
not
find
their
way
down
to
the
seashore
when
he
could
not
see
them
anywhere
was
terribly
upset
he
climbed
high
trees
and
looked
out
from
the
top
branches
to
try
and
see
the
doctor
s
high
hat
he
waved
and
shouted
he
called
to
all
the
animals
by
name
but
it
was
no
use
they
seemed
to
have
disappeared
altogether
indeed
they
had
lost
their
way
very
badly
they
had
strayed
a
long
way
off
the
path
and
the
jungle
was
so
thick
with
bushes
and
creepers
and
vines
that
sometimes
they
could
hardly
move
at
all
and
the
doctor
had
to
take
out
his
and
cut
his
way
along
they
stumbled
into
wet
boggy
places
they
got
all
tangled
up
in
thick
they
scratched
themselves
on
thorns
and
twice
they
nearly
lost
the
in
the
there
seemed
no
end
to
their
troubles
and
nowhere
could
they
come
upon
a
path
at
last
after
blundering
about
like
this
for
many
days
getting
their
clothes
torn
and
their
faces
covered
with
mud
they
walked
right
into
the
king
s
by
mistake
the
king
s
men
came
running
up
at
once
and
caught
them
but
polynesia
flew
into
a
tree
in
the
garden
without
anybody
seeing
her
and
hid
herself
the
doctor
and
the
rest
were
taken
before
the
king
ha
ha
cried
the
king
so
you
are
caught
again
this
time
you
shall
not
escape
take
them
all
back
to
prison
and
put
double
locks
on
the
door
this
white
man
shall
scrub
my
for
the
rest
of
his
life
so
the
doctor
and
his
pets
were
led
back
to
prison
and
locked
up
and
the
doctor
was
told
that
in
the
morning
he
must
begin
scrubbing
the
they
were
all
very
unhappy
this
is
a
great
nuisance
said
the
doctor
i
really
must
get
back
to
puddleby
that
poor
sailor
will
think
i
ve
stolen
his
ship
if
i
don
t
get
home
soon
i
wonder
if
those
hinges
are
but
the
door
was
very
strong
and
firmly
locked
there
seemed
no
chance
of
getting
out
then
began
to
cry
again
all
this
time
polynesia
was
still
sitting
in
the
tree
in
the
she
was
saying
nothing
and
blinking
her
eyes
this
was
always
a
very
bad
sign
with
polynesia
whenever
she
said
nothing
and
blinked
her
eyes
it
meant
that
somebody
had
been
making
trouble
and
she
was
thinking
out
some
way
to
put
things
right
people
who
made
trouble
for
polynesia
or
her
friends
were
nearly
always
sorry
for
it
afterwards
presently
she
spied
swinging
through
the
trees
still
looking
for
the
doctor
when
saw
her
he
came
into
her
tree
and
asked
her
what
had
become
of
him
the
doctor
and
all
the
animals
have
been
caught
by
the
king
s
men
and
locked
up
again
whispered
polynesia
we
lost
our
way
in
the
jungle
and
blundered
into
the
by
but
couldn
t
you
guide
them
asked
and
he
began
to
scold
the
parrot
for
letting
them
get
lost
while
he
was
away
looking
for
the
cocoanuts
it
was
all
that
stupid
pig
s
fault
said
polynesia
he
would
keep
running
off
the
path
hunting
for
and
i
was
kept
so
busy
catching
him
and
bringing
him
back
that
i
turned
to
the
left
instead
of
the
right
when
we
reached
the
there
s
prince
bumpo
coming
into
the
garden
he
must
not
see
t
move
whatever
you
do
and
there
sure
enough
was
prince
bumpo
the
king
s
son
opening
the
he
carried
a
book
of
under
his
arm
he
came
strolling
down
the
humming
a
sad
song
till
he
reached
a
stone
seat
right
under
the
tree
where
the
parrot
and
the
monkey
were
hiding
then
he
lay
down
on
the
seat
and
began
reading
the
to
himself
and
polynesia
watched
him
keeping
very
quiet
and
still
illustration
he
began
reading
the
to
himself
after
a
while
the
king
s
son
laid
the
book
down
and
sighed
a
weary
sigh
if
i
were
only
a
prince
said
he
with
a
dreamy
look
in
his
eyes
then
the
parrot
talking
in
a
small
high
voice
like
a
little
girl
said
aloud
bumpo
some
one
might
turn
thee
into
a
white
prince
the
king
s
son
started
up
off
the
seat
and
looked
all
around
what
is
this
i
hear
he
cried
methought
the
sweet
music
of
a
fairy
s
silver
voice
rang
from
yonder
bower
strange
worthy
prince
said
polynesia
keeping
very
still
so
bumpo
couldn
t
see
her
thou
sayest
winged
words
of
truth
for
tis
i
tripsitinka
the
queen
of
the
fairies
that
speak
to
thee
i
am
hiding
in
a
oh
tell
me
cried
bumpo
clasping
his
hands
in
joy
who
is
it
can
turn
me
white
in
thy
father
s
prison
said
the
parrot
there
lies
a
famous
wizard
john
dolittle
by
name
many
things
he
knows
of
medicine
and
magic
and
mighty
deeds
has
he
performed
yet
thy
kingly
father
leaves
him
languishing
long
and
lingering
hours
go
to
him
brave
bumpo
secretly
when
the
sun
has
set
and
behold
thou
shalt
be
made
the
whitest
prince
that
ever
won
fair
lady
i
have
said
enough
i
must
now
go
back
to
fairyland
farewell
farewell
cried
the
prince
a
thousand
thanks
good
tripsitinka
and
he
sat
down
on
the
seat
again
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
waiting
for
the
sun
to
set
twelfth
medicine
and
magic
very
very
quietly
making
sure
that
no
one
should
see
her
polynesia
then
slipped
out
at
the
back
of
the
tree
and
flew
across
to
the
prison
she
found
poking
his
nose
through
the
bars
of
the
window
trying
to
sniff
the
that
came
from
the
she
told
the
pig
to
bring
the
doctor
to
the
window
because
she
wanted
to
speak
to
him
so
went
and
woke
the
doctor
who
was
taking
a
nap
listen
whispered
the
parrot
when
john
dolittle
s
face
appeared
prince
bumpo
is
coming
here
to
see
you
and
you
ve
got
to
find
some
way
to
turn
him
white
but
be
sure
to
make
him
promise
you
first
that
he
will
open
the
and
find
a
ship
for
you
to
cross
the
sea
this
is
all
very
well
said
the
doctor
but
it
isn
t
so
easy
to
turn
a
black
man
white
you
speak
as
though
he
were
a
dress
to
be
it
s
not
so
simple
shall
the
leopard
change
his
spots
or
the
ethiopian
his
skin
you
know
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
said
polynesia
impatiently
but
you
turn
this
coon
white
think
of
a
hard
you
ve
got
plenty
of
medicines
left
in
the
bag
he
ll
do
anything
for
you
if
you
change
his
color
it
is
your
only
chance
to
get
out
of
well
i
suppose
it
be
possible
said
the
doctor
let
me
and
he
went
over
to
his
murmuring
something
about
liberated
chlorine
on
as
a
temporary
measure
spread
well
that
night
prince
bumpo
came
secretly
to
the
doctor
in
prison
and
said
to
him
white
man
i
am
an
unhappy
prince
years
ago
i
went
in
search
of
the
sleeping
beauty
whom
i
had
read
of
in
a
book
and
having
traveled
through
the
world
many
days
i
at
last
found
her
and
kissed
the
lady
very
gently
to
awaken
the
book
said
i
should
tis
true
indeed
that
she
awoke
but
when
she
saw
my
face
she
cried
out
oh
he
s
black
and
she
ran
away
and
wouldn
t
marry
went
to
sleep
again
somewhere
else
so
i
came
back
full
of
sadness
to
my
father
s
kingdom
now
i
hear
that
you
are
a
wonderful
magician
and
have
many
powerful
potions
so
i
come
to
you
for
help
if
you
will
turn
me
white
so
that
i
may
go
back
to
the
sleeping
beauty
i
will
give
you
half
my
kingdom
and
anything
besides
you
prince
bumpo
said
the
doctor
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
bottles
in
his
supposing
i
made
your
hair
a
nice
blonde
not
that
do
instead
to
make
you
happy
no
said
bumpo
nothing
else
will
satisfy
me
i
must
be
a
white
you
know
it
is
very
hard
to
change
the
color
of
a
prince
said
the
one
of
the
hardest
things
a
magician
can
do
you
only
want
your
face
white
do
you
not
yes
that
is
all
said
bumpo
because
i
shall
wear
shining
armor
and
gauntlets
of
steel
like
the
other
white
princes
and
ride
on
a
must
your
face
be
white
all
over
asked
the
doctor
yes
all
over
said
and
i
would
like
my
eyes
blue
too
but
i
suppose
that
would
be
very
hard
to
yes
it
would
said
the
doctor
quickly
well
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
you
you
will
have
to
be
very
patient
know
with
some
medicines
you
can
never
be
very
sure
i
might
have
to
try
two
or
three
times
you
have
a
strong
well
that
s
all
right
now
come
over
here
by
the
but
before
i
do
anything
you
must
first
go
down
to
the
beach
and
get
a
ship
ready
with
food
in
it
to
take
me
across
the
sea
do
not
speak
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
and
when
i
have
done
as
you
ask
you
must
let
me
and
all
my
animals
out
of
prison
the
crown
of
jolliginki
so
the
prince
promised
and
went
away
to
get
a
ship
ready
at
the
seashore
when
he
came
back
and
said
that
it
was
done
the
doctor
asked
to
bring
a
basin
then
he
mixed
a
lot
of
medicines
in
the
basin
and
told
bumpo
to
dip
his
face
in
it
the
prince
leaned
down
and
put
his
face
up
to
the
ears
he
held
it
there
a
long
long
that
the
doctor
seemed
to
get
dreadfully
anxious
and
fidgety
standing
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
looking
at
all
the
bottles
he
had
used
for
the
mixture
and
reading
the
labels
on
them
again
and
again
a
strong
smell
filled
the
prison
like
the
smell
of
brown
paper
burning
at
last
the
prince
lifted
his
face
up
out
of
the
basin
breathing
very
hard
and
all
the
animals
cried
out
in
surprise
for
the
prince
s
face
had
turned
as
white
as
snow
and
his
eyes
which
had
been
were
a
manly
gray
when
john
dolittle
lent
him
a
little
to
see
himself
in
he
sang
for
joy
and
began
dancing
around
the
prison
but
the
doctor
asked
him
not
to
make
so
much
noise
about
it
and
when
he
had
closed
his
in
a
hurry
he
told
him
to
open
the
bumpo
begged
that
he
might
keep
the
as
it
was
the
only
one
in
the
kingdom
of
jolliginki
and
he
wanted
to
look
at
himself
all
day
long
but
the
doctor
said
he
needed
it
to
shave
with
then
the
prince
taking
a
bunch
of
copper
keys
from
his
pocket
undid
the
great
double
locks
and
the
doctor
with
all
his
animals
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
down
to
the
seashore
while
bumpo
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
empty
dungeon
smiling
after
them
happily
his
big
face
shining
like
polished
ivory
in
the
light
of
the
moon
when
they
came
to
the
beach
they
saw
polynesia
and
waiting
for
them
on
the
rocks
near
the
ship
i
feel
sorry
about
bumpo
said
the
doctor
i
am
afraid
that
medicine
i
used
will
never
last
most
likely
he
will
be
as
black
as
ever
when
he
wakes
up
in
the
s
one
reason
why
i
didn
t
like
to
leave
the
mirror
with
him
but
then
again
he
stay
had
never
used
that
mixture
before
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
surprised
myself
that
it
worked
so
well
but
i
had
to
do
something
didn
t
i
couldn
t
possibly
scrub
the
king
s
kitchen
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
was
such
a
dirty
kitchen
could
see
it
from
the
well
bumpo
oh
of
course
he
will
know
we
were
just
joking
with
him
said
the
parrot
they
had
no
business
to
lock
us
up
said
waggling
her
tail
angrily
we
never
did
them
any
harm
serve
him
right
if
he
does
turn
black
again
i
hope
it
s
a
dark
but
didn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
it
said
the
doctor
it
was
the
king
his
father
who
had
us
locked
wasn
t
bumpo
s
fault
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
go
back
and
ll
send
him
some
candy
when
i
get
to
puddleby
and
who
knows
may
stay
white
after
the
sleeping
beauty
would
never
have
him
even
if
he
did
said
he
looked
better
the
way
he
was
i
thought
but
he
d
never
be
anything
but
ugly
no
matter
what
color
he
was
still
he
had
a
good
heart
said
the
romantic
of
a
good
heart
after
all
handsome
is
as
handsome
i
don
t
believe
the
poor
booby
found
the
sleeping
beauty
at
all
said
jip
the
dog
most
likely
he
kissed
some
farmer
s
fat
wife
who
was
taking
a
snooze
under
an
can
t
blame
her
for
getting
scared
i
wonder
who
he
ll
go
and
kiss
this
time
silly
business
then
the
the
white
mouse
jip
and
the
owl
went
on
to
the
ship
with
the
doctor
but
polynesia
and
the
crocodile
stayed
behind
because
africa
was
their
proper
home
the
land
where
they
were
born
and
when
the
doctor
stood
upon
the
boat
he
looked
over
the
side
across
the
water
and
then
he
remembered
that
they
had
no
one
with
them
to
guide
them
back
to
puddleby
the
wide
wide
sea
looked
terribly
big
and
lonesome
in
the
moonlight
and
he
began
to
wonder
if
they
would
lose
their
way
when
they
passed
out
of
sight
of
land
but
even
while
he
was
wondering
they
heard
a
strange
whispering
noise
high
in
the
air
coming
through
the
night
and
the
animals
all
stopped
saying
and
listened
the
noise
grew
louder
and
bigger
it
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
to
sound
like
the
autumn
wind
blowing
through
the
leaves
of
a
or
a
great
great
rain
beating
down
upon
a
roof
and
jip
with
his
nose
pointing
and
his
tail
quite
straight
said
birds
of
s
it
and
then
they
all
looked
up
and
there
streaming
across
the
face
of
the
moon
like
a
huge
swarm
of
tiny
ants
they
could
see
thousands
and
thousands
of
little
birds
soon
the
whole
sky
seemed
full
of
them
and
still
more
kept
and
more
there
were
so
many
that
for
a
little
they
covered
the
whole
moon
so
it
could
not
shine
and
the
sea
grew
dark
and
when
a
passes
over
the
sun
and
presently
all
these
birds
came
down
close
skimming
over
the
water
and
the
land
and
the
was
left
clear
above
and
the
moon
shone
as
before
still
never
a
call
nor
a
cry
nor
a
song
they
sound
but
this
great
rustling
of
feathers
which
grew
greater
now
than
ever
when
they
began
to
settle
on
the
sands
along
the
ropes
of
the
and
everywhere
except
the
doctor
could
see
that
they
had
blue
wings
and
white
breasts
and
very
short
feathered
legs
as
soon
as
they
had
all
found
a
place
to
sit
suddenly
there
was
no
noise
left
was
quiet
all
was
still
and
in
the
silent
moonlight
john
dolittle
spoke
i
had
no
idea
that
we
had
been
in
africa
so
long
it
will
be
nearly
summer
when
we
get
home
for
these
are
the
swallows
going
back
swallows
i
thank
you
for
waiting
for
us
it
is
very
thoughtful
of
you
now
we
need
not
be
afraid
that
we
will
lose
our
way
upon
the
sea
pull
up
the
anchor
and
set
the
sail
illustration
crying
bitterly
and
waving
till
the
ship
was
out
of
sight
when
the
ship
moved
out
upon
the
water
those
who
stayed
behind
polynesia
and
the
crocodile
grew
terribly
sad
for
never
in
their
lives
had
they
known
any
one
they
liked
so
well
as
doctor
john
dolittle
of
and
after
they
had
called
to
him
again
and
again
and
again
they
still
stood
there
upon
the
rocks
crying
bitterly
and
waving
till
the
ship
was
out
of
sight
thirteenth
red
sails
and
blue
wings
sailing
homeward
the
doctor
s
ship
had
to
pass
the
coast
of
barbary
this
coast
is
the
seashore
of
the
great
desert
it
is
a
wild
lonely
sand
and
stones
and
it
was
here
that
the
barbary
pirates
lived
these
pirates
a
bad
lot
of
men
used
to
wait
for
sailors
to
be
shipwrecked
on
their
shores
and
often
if
they
saw
a
boat
passing
they
would
come
out
in
their
fast
and
chase
it
when
they
caught
a
boat
like
this
at
sea
they
would
steal
everything
on
it
and
after
they
had
taken
the
people
off
they
would
sink
the
ship
and
sail
back
to
barbary
singing
songs
and
feeling
proud
of
the
mischief
they
had
done
then
they
used
to
make
the
people
they
had
caught
write
home
to
their
friends
for
money
and
if
the
friends
sent
no
money
the
pirates
often
threw
the
people
into
the
sea
now
one
sunshiny
day
the
doctor
and
were
walking
up
and
down
on
the
ship
for
exercise
a
nice
fresh
wind
was
blowing
the
boat
along
and
everybody
was
happy
presently
saw
the
sail
of
another
ship
a
long
way
behind
them
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
it
was
a
red
sail
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
that
sail
said
i
have
a
feeling
it
isn
t
a
friendly
ship
i
am
afraid
there
is
more
trouble
coming
to
jip
who
was
lying
near
taking
a
nap
in
the
sun
began
to
growl
and
talk
in
his
sleep
i
smell
roast
beef
cooking
he
underdone
roast
brown
gravy
over
good
gracious
cried
the
doctor
what
s
the
matter
with
the
dog
is
he
in
his
well
as
talking
i
suppose
he
is
said
all
dogs
can
smell
in
their
but
what
is
he
smelling
asked
the
doctor
there
is
no
roast
beef
cooking
on
our
no
said
the
roast
beef
must
be
on
that
other
ship
over
but
that
s
ten
miles
away
said
the
doctor
he
couldn
t
smell
that
far
surely
oh
yes
he
could
said
you
ask
then
jip
still
fast
asleep
began
to
growl
again
and
his
lip
curled
up
angrily
showing
his
clean
white
teeth
i
smell
bad
men
he
the
worst
men
i
ever
smelt
i
smell
trouble
i
smell
a
bad
scoundrels
fighting
against
one
brave
man
i
want
to
help
him
then
he
barked
loud
and
woke
himself
up
with
a
surprised
look
on
his
face
see
cried
that
boat
is
nearer
now
you
can
count
its
three
big
red
whoever
it
is
they
are
coming
after
us
i
wonder
who
they
they
are
bad
sailors
said
jip
and
their
ship
is
very
swift
they
are
surely
the
pirates
of
well
we
must
put
up
more
sails
on
our
boat
said
the
doctor
so
we
can
go
faster
and
get
away
from
them
run
downstairs
jip
and
fetch
me
all
the
sails
you
the
dog
hurried
downstairs
and
dragged
up
every
sail
he
could
find
illustration
they
are
surely
the
pirates
of
barbary
but
even
when
all
these
were
put
up
on
the
masts
to
catch
the
wind
the
boat
did
not
go
nearly
as
fast
as
the
pirates
kept
coming
on
behind
closer
and
closer
this
is
a
poor
ship
the
prince
gave
us
said
the
the
slowest
he
could
find
i
should
think
might
as
well
try
to
win
a
race
in
a
as
hope
to
get
away
from
them
in
this
old
barge
look
how
near
they
are
now
can
see
the
mustaches
on
the
faces
of
the
of
them
what
are
we
going
to
do
then
the
doctor
asked
to
fly
up
and
tell
the
swallows
that
pirates
were
coming
after
them
in
a
swift
ship
and
what
should
he
do
about
it
when
the
swallows
heard
this
they
all
came
down
on
to
the
doctor
s
ship
and
they
told
him
to
unravel
some
pieces
of
long
rope
and
make
them
into
a
lot
of
thin
strings
as
quickly
as
he
could
then
the
ends
of
these
strings
were
tied
on
to
the
front
of
the
ship
and
the
swallows
took
hold
of
the
strings
with
their
feet
and
flew
off
pulling
the
boat
along
and
although
swallows
are
not
very
strong
when
only
one
or
two
are
by
themselves
it
is
different
when
there
are
a
great
lot
of
them
together
and
there
tied
to
the
doctor
s
ship
were
a
thousand
strings
and
two
thousand
swallows
were
pulling
on
each
terribly
swift
fliers
and
in
a
moment
the
doctor
found
himself
traveling
so
fast
he
had
to
hold
his
hat
on
with
both
hands
for
he
felt
as
though
the
ship
itself
were
flying
through
waves
that
frothed
and
boiled
with
speed
and
all
the
animals
on
the
ship
began
to
laugh
and
dance
about
in
the
rushing
air
for
when
they
looked
back
at
the
pirates
ship
they
could
see
that
it
was
growing
smaller
now
instead
of
bigger
the
red
sails
were
being
left
far
far
behind
fourteenth
the
rats
warning
dragging
a
ship
through
the
sea
is
hard
work
and
after
two
or
three
hours
the
swallows
began
to
get
tired
in
the
wings
and
short
of
breath
then
they
sent
a
message
down
to
the
doctor
to
say
that
they
would
have
to
take
a
rest
soon
and
that
they
would
pull
the
boat
over
to
an
island
not
far
off
and
hide
it
in
a
deep
bay
till
they
had
got
breath
enough
to
go
on
and
presently
the
doctor
saw
the
island
they
had
spoken
of
it
had
a
very
beautiful
high
green
mountain
in
the
middle
of
it
when
the
ship
had
sailed
safely
into
the
bay
where
it
could
not
be
seen
from
the
open
sea
the
doctor
said
he
would
get
off
on
to
the
island
to
look
for
there
was
none
left
to
drink
on
his
ship
and
he
told
all
the
animals
to
get
out
too
and
romp
on
the
grass
to
stretch
their
legs
now
as
they
were
getting
off
the
doctor
noticed
that
a
whole
lot
of
rats
were
coming
up
from
downstairs
and
leaving
the
ship
as
well
jip
started
to
run
after
them
because
chasing
rats
had
always
been
his
favorite
game
but
the
doctor
told
him
to
stop
and
one
big
black
rat
who
seemed
to
want
to
say
something
to
the
doctor
now
crept
forward
timidly
along
the
rail
watching
the
dog
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
after
he
had
coughed
nervously
two
or
three
times
and
cleaned
his
whiskers
and
wiped
his
mouth
he
said
know
of
course
that
all
ships
have
rats
in
them
doctor
do
you
not
and
the
doctor
said
and
you
have
heard
that
rats
always
leave
a
sinking
ship
yes
said
the
so
i
ve
been
people
said
the
rat
always
speak
of
it
with
a
though
it
were
something
disgraceful
but
you
can
t
blame
us
can
you
after
all
who
stay
on
a
sinking
ship
if
he
could
get
off
it
illustration
and
you
have
heard
that
rats
always
leave
a
sinking
ship
it
s
very
natural
said
the
very
natural
i
quite
understand
was
there
anything
else
you
wished
to
say
yes
said
the
rat
i
ve
come
to
tell
you
that
we
are
leaving
this
one
but
we
wanted
to
warn
you
before
we
go
this
is
a
bad
ship
you
have
here
it
isn
t
safe
the
sides
aren
t
strong
enough
its
boards
are
rotten
before
night
it
will
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
but
how
do
you
know
asked
the
doctor
we
always
know
answered
the
rat
the
tips
of
our
tails
get
that
tingly
when
your
foot
s
asleep
this
morning
at
six
o
clock
while
i
was
getting
breakfast
my
tail
suddenly
began
to
tingle
at
first
i
thought
it
was
my
rheumatism
coming
back
so
i
went
and
asked
my
aunt
how
she
remember
her
long
piebald
rat
rather
skinny
who
came
to
see
you
in
puddleby
last
spring
with
jaundice
she
said
tail
was
tingling
like
everything
then
we
knew
for
sure
that
this
boat
was
going
to
sink
in
less
than
two
days
and
we
all
made
up
our
minds
to
leave
it
as
soon
as
we
got
near
enough
to
any
land
it
s
a
bad
ship
doctor
don
t
sail
in
it
any
more
or
you
ll
be
surely
drowned
we
are
now
going
to
look
for
a
good
place
to
live
on
this
said
the
doctor
and
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
to
tell
me
very
considerate
of
give
my
regards
to
your
aunt
i
remember
her
perfectly
leave
that
rat
alone
jip
come
here
lie
down
so
then
the
doctor
and
all
his
animals
went
off
carrying
pails
and
saucepans
to
look
for
water
on
the
island
while
the
swallows
took
their
rest
i
wonder
what
is
the
name
of
this
island
said
the
doctor
as
he
was
climbing
up
the
mountainside
it
seems
a
pleasant
place
what
a
lot
of
birds
there
are
why
these
are
the
canary
islands
said
don
t
you
hear
the
canaries
singing
the
doctor
stopped
and
listened
why
to
be
course
he
said
how
stupid
of
me
i
wonder
if
they
can
tell
us
where
to
find
and
presently
the
canaries
who
had
heard
all
about
doctor
dolittle
from
birds
of
passage
came
and
led
him
to
a
beautiful
spring
of
cool
clear
water
where
the
canaries
used
to
take
their
bath
and
they
showed
him
lovely
meadows
where
the
grew
and
all
the
other
sights
of
their
island
and
the
was
glad
they
had
come
because
he
liked
the
green
grass
so
much
better
than
the
dried
apples
he
had
been
eating
on
the
ship
and
squeaked
for
joy
when
he
found
a
whole
valley
full
of
wild
a
little
later
when
they
had
all
had
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
were
lying
on
their
backs
while
the
canaries
sang
for
them
two
of
the
swallows
came
hurrying
up
very
flustered
and
excited
doctor
they
cried
the
pirates
have
come
into
the
bay
and
they
ve
all
got
on
to
your
ship
they
are
downstairs
looking
for
things
to
steal
they
have
left
their
own
ship
with
nobody
on
it
if
you
hurry
and
come
down
to
the
shore
you
can
get
on
to
their
is
very
escape
but
you
ll
have
to
that
s
a
good
idea
said
the
splendid
and
he
called
his
animals
together
at
once
said
to
the
canaries
and
ran
down
to
the
beach
when
they
reached
the
shore
they
saw
the
with
the
three
red
sails
standing
in
the
water
as
the
swallows
had
was
nobody
on
it
all
the
pirates
were
downstairs
in
the
doctor
s
ship
looking
for
things
to
steal
so
john
dolittle
told
his
animals
to
walk
very
softly
and
they
all
crept
on
to
the
fifteenth
the
barbary
dragon
everything
would
have
gone
all
right
if
the
pig
had
not
caught
a
cold
in
his
head
while
eating
the
damp
on
the
island
this
is
what
happened
after
they
had
pulled
up
the
anchor
without
a
sound
and
were
moving
the
ship
very
very
carefully
out
of
the
bay
suddenly
sneezed
so
loud
that
the
pirates
on
the
other
ship
came
rushing
upstairs
to
see
what
the
noise
was
as
soon
as
they
saw
that
the
doctor
was
escaping
they
sailed
the
other
boat
right
across
the
entrance
to
the
bay
so
that
the
doctor
could
not
get
out
into
the
open
sea
then
the
leader
of
these
bad
men
who
called
himself
ben
ali
the
dragon
shook
his
fist
at
the
doctor
and
shouted
across
the
water
ha
ha

are
caught

fine
friend

were
going
to
run

my
ship

a
of
poor
began
to
weep
and
made
ready
to
fly
to
save
her
life
but
the
owl
whispered
to
the
doctor
keep
him
talking
doctor
be
pleasant
to
him
our
old
ship
is
bound
to
sink

said
it

bottom
of
the
sea
before

rats

never
wrong
be
pleasant
till

ship

until

said
the
doctor

talk
about

jip

real
pirate

look

but
they

pistols
and
swords
said
the
doctor
no
that
would
never
do
i
must
talk
to
him
look
here
ben
but
before
the
doctor
could
say
any
more
the
pirates
began
to
sail
the
ship
nearer
laughing
with
glee
and
saying
one
to
another
who
shall
be
the
first
to
catch
the
pig
poor
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
the
began
to
sharpen
his
horns
for
a
fight
by
rubbing
them
on
the
mast
of
the
ship
while
jip
kept
springing
into
the
air
and
barking
and
calling
ben
ali
bad
names
in
but
presently
something
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
the
pirates
they
stopped
laughing
and
cracking
jokes
they
looked
puzzled
something
was
making
them
uneasy
then
ben
ali
staring
down
at
his
feet
suddenly
bellowed
out
thunder
and
lightning
boat
s
and
then
the
other
pirates
peered
over
the
side
and
they
saw
that
the
boat
was
indeed
getting
lower
and
lower
in
the
water
and
one
of
them
said
to
ben
ali
but
surely
if
this
old
boat
were
sinking
we
should
see
the
rats
leaving
and
jip
shouted
across
from
the
other
ship
you
great
duffers
there
are
no
rats
there
to
leave
they
left
two
hours
ago
ha
ha
to
you
my
fine
friends
but
of
course
the
men
did
not
understand
him
soon
the
front
end
of
the
ship
began
to
go
down
and
down
faster
and
the
boat
looked
almost
as
though
it
were
standing
on
its
head
and
the
pirates
had
to
cling
to
the
rails
and
the
masts
and
the
ropes
and
anything
to
keep
from
sliding
off
then
the
sea
rushed
roaring
in
through
all
the
windows
and
the
doors
and
at
last
the
ship
plunged
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
making
a
dreadful
gurgling
sound
and
the
six
bad
men
were
left
bobbing
about
in
the
deep
water
of
the
bay
some
of
them
started
to
swim
for
the
shores
of
the
island
while
others
came
and
tried
to
get
on
to
the
boat
where
the
doctor
was
but
jip
kept
snapping
at
their
noses
so
they
were
afraid
to
climb
up
the
side
of
the
ship
then
suddenly
they
all
cried
out
in
great
fear
sharks
the
sharks
are
coming
let
us
get
on
to
the
ship
before
they
eat
us
help
help
sharks
the
sharks
and
now
the
doctor
could
see
all
over
the
bay
the
backs
of
big
fishes
swimming
swiftly
through
the
water
and
one
great
shark
came
near
to
the
ship
and
poking
his
nose
out
of
the
water
he
said
to
the
doctor
are
you
john
dolittle
the
famous
yes
said
doctor
dolittle
that
is
my
well
said
the
shark
we
know
these
pirates
to
be
a
bad
ben
ali
if
they
are
annoying
you
we
will
gladly
eat
them
up
for
then
you
won
t
be
troubled
any
thank
you
said
the
doctor
this
is
really
most
attentive
but
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
eat
them
don
t
let
any
of
them
reach
the
shore
until
i
tell
keep
them
swimming
about
will
you
and
please
make
ben
ali
swim
over
here
that
i
may
talk
to
so
the
shark
went
off
and
chased
ben
ali
over
to
the
doctor
listen
ben
ali
said
john
dolittle
leaning
over
the
side
you
have
been
a
very
bad
man
and
i
understand
that
you
have
killed
many
people
these
good
sharks
here
have
just
offered
to
eat
you
up
for
twould
indeed
be
a
good
thing
if
the
seas
were
rid
of
you
but
if
you
will
promise
to
do
as
i
tell
you
i
will
let
you
go
in
what
must
i
do
asked
the
pirate
looking
down
sideways
at
the
big
shark
who
was
smelling
his
leg
under
the
water

ben
ali
then
he
looked
down
into
the
water
again
and
saw
the
great
fish
smelling
his
other
leg
very
well
he
said
sadly

the
doctor
that

pirate
though
he
call
himself

dragon
of
now
go
and
be
a
good
farmer
and
live
in
then
the
doctor
turned
to
the
big
shark
and
waving
his
hand
he
said
all
right
let
them
swim
safely
to
the
sixteenth
the
listener
having
thanked
the
sharks
again
for
their
kindness
the
doctor
and
his
pets
set
off
once
more
on
their
journey
home
in
the
swift
ship
with
the
three
red
sails
as
they
moved
out
into
the
open
sea
the
animals
all
went
downstairs
to
see
what
their
new
boat
was
like
inside
while
the
doctor
leant
on
the
rail
at
the
back
of
the
ship
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
watching
the
canary
islands
fade
away
in
the
blue
dusk
of
the
evening
while
he
was
standing
there
wondering
how
the
monkeys
were
getting
what
his
garden
would
look
like
when
he
got
back
to
puddleby
came
tumbling
up
the
stairs
all
smiles
and
full
of
news
doctor
she
cried
this
ship
of
the
pirates
is
simply
the
beds
downstairs
are
made
of
primrose
hundreds
of
big
pillows
and
cushions
there
are
thick
soft
carpets
on
the
floors
the
dishes
are
made
of
silver
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
and
things
the
it
s
just
like
a
shop
that
s
all
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
your
kept
five
different
kinds
of
sardines
those
men
come
and
look
oh
and
we
found
a
little
room
down
there
with
the
door
locked
and
we
are
all
crazy
to
get
in
and
see
what
s
inside
jip
says
it
must
be
where
the
pirates
kept
their
treasure
but
we
can
t
open
the
door
come
down
and
see
if
you
can
let
us
so
the
doctor
went
downstairs
and
he
saw
that
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
ship
he
found
the
animals
gathered
round
a
little
door
all
talking
at
once
trying
to
guess
what
was
inside
the
doctor
turned
the
handle
but
it
wouldn
t
open
then
they
all
started
to
hunt
for
the
key
they
looked
under
the
mat
they
looked
under
all
the
carpets
they
looked
in
all
the
cupboards
and
drawers
and
the
big
chests
in
the
ship
s
they
looked
everywhere
while
they
were
doing
this
they
discovered
a
lot
of
new
and
wonderful
things
that
the
pirates
must
have
stolen
from
other
ships
kashmir
shawls
as
thin
as
a
cobweb
embroidered
with
flowers
of
gold
jars
of
fine
tobacco
from
jamaica
carved
ivory
boxes
full
of
russian
tea
an
old
violin
with
a
string
broken
and
a
picture
on
the
back
a
set
of
big
carved
out
of
coral
and
amber
a
which
had
a
sword
inside
it
when
you
pulled
the
handle
six
with
tourquoise
and
silver
round
the
rims
and
a
lovely
great
made
of
mother
o
pearl
but
nowhere
in
the
whole
boat
could
they
find
a
key
to
fit
that
lock
so
they
all
came
back
to
the
door
and
jip
peered
through
the
but
something
had
been
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
inside
and
he
could
see
nothing
while
they
were
standing
around
wondering
what
they
should
do
the
owl
suddenly
said
sh
do
believe
there
s
some
one
in
there
they
all
kept
still
a
moment
then
the
doctor
said
illustration
sh
do
believe
there
s
some
one
in
there
you
must
be
mistaken
i
don
t
hear
i
m
sure
of
it
said
the
owl
sh
it
is
t
you
hear
that
no
i
do
not
said
the
doctor
what
kind
of
a
sound
is
it
i
hear
the
noise
of
some
one
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
said
the
owl
but
that
makes
hardly
any
sound
at
all
said
the
doctor
you
couldn
t
hear
that
out
pardon
me
but
i
can
said
i
tell
you
there
is
some
one
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
almost
everything
makes
your
ears
are
only
sharp
enough
to
catch
it
bats
can
hear
a
mole
walking
in
his
tunnel
under
the
they
think
they
re
good
hearers
but
we
owls
can
tell
you
using
only
one
ear
the
color
of
a
kitten
from
the
way
it
winks
in
the
well
well
said
the
doctor
you
surprise
me
that
s
very
interesting
listen
again
and
tell
me
what
he
s
doing
i
m
not
sure
yet
said
if
it
s
a
man
at
all
maybe
it
s
a
woman
lift
me
up
and
let
me
listen
at
the
and
i
ll
soon
tell
so
the
doctor
lifted
the
owl
up
and
held
him
close
to
the
lock
of
the
door
after
a
moment
said
now
he
s
rubbing
his
face
with
his
left
hand
it
is
a
small
hand
and
a
small
face
it
be
a
now
he
pushes
his
hair
back
off
his
s
a
man
all
women
sometimes
do
that
said
the
doctor
true
said
the
owl
but
when
they
do
their
long
hair
makes
quite
a
different
sound
sh
make
that
fidgety
pig
keep
still
now
all
hold
your
breath
a
moment
so
i
can
listen
well
this
is
very
difficult
what
i
m
doing
the
pesky
door
is
so
thick
sh
everybody
quite
your
eyes
and
don
t
leaned
down
and
listened
again
very
hard
and
long
at
last
he
looked
up
into
the
doctor
s
face
and
said
the
man
in
there
is
unhappy
he
weeps
he
has
taken
care
not
to
blubber
or
sniffle
lest
we
should
find
out
that
he
is
crying
but
i
sound
of
a
tear
falling
on
his
how
do
you
know
it
wasn
t
a
drop
of
water
falling
off
the
ceiling
on
him
asked
pshaw
ignorance
sniffed
a
drop
of
water
falling
off
the
ceiling
would
have
made
ten
times
as
much
noise
well
said
the
doctor
if
the
poor
fellow
s
unhappy
we
ve
got
to
get
in
and
see
what
s
the
matter
with
him
find
me
an
axe
and
i
ll
chop
the
door
seventeenth
the
ocean
gossips
right
away
an
axe
was
found
and
the
doctor
soon
chopped
a
hole
in
the
door
big
enough
to
clamber
through
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
at
all
it
was
so
dark
inside
so
he
struck
a
match
the
room
was
quite
small
no
window
the
ceiling
low
for
furniture
there
was
only
one
little
stool
all
round
the
room
big
barrels
stood
against
the
walls
fastened
at
the
bottom
so
they
wouldn
t
tumble
with
the
rolling
of
the
ship
and
above
the
barrels
pewter
jugs
of
all
sizes
hung
from
wooden
pegs
there
was
a
strong
winey
smell
and
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
sat
a
little
boy
about
eight
years
old
crying
bitterly
i
declare
it
is
the
pirates
said
jip
in
a
whisper
yes
very
rum
said
the
smell
makes
me
the
little
boy
seemed
rather
frightened
to
find
a
man
standing
there
before
him
and
all
those
animals
staring
in
through
the
hole
in
the
broken
door
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
john
dolittle
s
face
by
the
light
of
the
match
he
stopped
crying
and
got
up
you
aren
t
one
of
the
pirates
are
you
he
asked
and
when
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
long
and
loud
the
little
boy
smiled
too
and
came
and
took
his
hand
you
laugh
like
a
friend
he
not
like
a
pirate
could
you
tell
me
where
my
uncle
is
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
said
the
doctor
when
did
you
see
him
last
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
said
the
boy
i
and
my
uncle
were
out
fishing
in
our
little
boat
when
the
pirates
came
and
caught
us
they
sunk
our
and
brought
us
both
on
to
this
ship
they
told
my
uncle
that
they
wanted
him
to
be
a
pirate
like
he
was
clever
at
sailing
a
ship
in
all
weathers
but
he
said
he
didn
t
want
to
be
a
pirate
because
killing
people
and
stealing
was
no
work
for
a
good
fisherman
to
do
then
the
leader
ben
ali
got
very
angry
and
gnashed
his
teeth
and
said
they
would
throw
my
uncle
into
the
sea
if
he
didn
t
do
as
they
said
they
sent
me
downstairs
and
i
heard
the
noise
of
a
fight
going
on
above
and
when
they
let
me
come
up
again
next
day
my
uncle
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
asked
the
pirates
where
he
was
but
they
wouldn
t
tell
me
i
am
very
much
afraid
they
threw
him
into
the
sea
and
drowned
and
the
little
boy
began
to
cry
again
well
a
minute
said
the
doctor
don
t
cry
let
s
go
and
have
tea
in
the
and
we
ll
talk
it
over
maybe
your
uncle
is
quite
safe
all
the
time
you
don
t
that
he
was
drowned
do
you
and
that
s
something
perhaps
we
can
find
him
for
you
first
we
ll
go
and
have
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
all
the
animals
had
been
standing
around
listening
with
great
curiosity
and
when
they
had
gone
into
the
ship
s
and
were
having
tea
came
up
behind
the
doctor
s
chair
and
whispered
ask
the
porpoises
if
the
boy
s
uncle
was
ll
all
right
said
the
doctor
taking
a
second
piece
of
what
are
those
funny
clicking
noises
you
are
making
with
your
tongue
asked
the
boy
oh
i
just
said
a
couple
of
words
in
the
doctor
answered
this
is
one
of
my
i
didn
t
even
know
that
ducks
had
a
language
said
the
boy
are
all
these
other
animals
your
pets
too
what
is
that
thing
with
two
heads
sh
the
doctor
whispered
that
is
the
don
t
let
him
see
we
re
talking
about
gets
so
dreadfully
embarrassed
tell
me
how
did
you
come
to
be
locked
up
in
that
little
room
the
pirates
shut
me
in
there
when
they
were
going
off
to
steal
things
from
another
ship
when
i
heard
some
one
chopping
on
the
door
i
didn
t
know
who
it
could
be
i
was
very
glad
to
find
it
was
you
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
find
my
uncle
for
me
well
we
are
going
to
try
very
hard
said
the
doctor
now
what
was
your
uncle
like
to
look
at
he
had
red
hair
the
boy
very
red
hair
and
the
picture
of
an
anchor
tattooed
on
his
arm
he
was
a
strong
man
a
kind
uncle
and
the
best
sailor
in
the
south
atlantic
his
was
called
saucy
what
s
cutterigsloop
whispered
turning
to
jip
sh
s
the
kind
of
a
ship
the
man
had
said
jip
keep
still
can
t
you
oh
said
the
pig
is
that
all
i
thought
it
was
something
to
so
the
doctor
left
the
boy
to
play
with
the
animals
in
the
and
went
upstairs
to
look
for
passing
porpoises
and
soon
a
whole
school
came
dancing
and
jumping
through
the
water
on
their
way
to
brazil
when
they
saw
the
doctor
leaning
on
the
rail
of
his
ship
they
came
over
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
and
the
doctor
asked
them
if
they
had
seen
anything
of
a
man
with
red
hair
and
an
anchor
tattooed
on
his
arm
do
you
mean
the
master
of
saucy
asked
the
porpoises
yes
said
the
doctor
that
s
the
man
has
he
been
drowned
his
was
sunk
said
the
for
we
saw
it
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
there
was
nobody
inside
it
because
we
went
and
his
little
nephew
is
on
the
ship
with
me
here
said
the
doctor
and
he
is
terribly
afraid
that
the
pirates
threw
his
uncle
into
the
sea
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
find
out
for
me
for
sure
whether
he
has
been
drowned
or
not
oh
he
isn
t
drowned
said
the
porpoises
if
he
were
we
would
be
sure
to
have
heard
of
it
from
the
decapods
we
hear
all
the
news
the
call
us
the
ocean
the
little
boy
we
are
sorry
we
do
not
know
where
his
uncle
is
but
we
are
quite
certain
he
hasn
t
been
drowned
in
the
so
the
doctor
ran
downstairs
with
the
news
and
told
the
nephew
who
clapped
his
hands
with
happiness
and
the
took
the
little
boy
on
his
back
and
gave
him
a
ride
round
the
table
while
all
the
other
animals
followed
behind
beating
the
with
spoons
pretending
it
was
a
parade
eighteenth
smells
your
uncle
must
now
be
said
the
that
is
the
next
that
we
know
he
wasn
t
thrown
into
the
then
came
up
to
him
again
and
whispered
ask
the
eagles
to
look
for
the
man
no
living
creature
can
see
better
than
an
eagle
when
they
are
miles
high
in
the
air
they
can
count
the
ants
crawling
on
the
ground
ask
the
so
the
doctor
sent
one
of
the
swallows
off
to
get
some
eagles
and
in
about
an
hour
the
little
bird
came
back
with
six
different
kinds
of
eagles
a
black
eagle
a
bald
eagle
a
fish
eagle
a
golden
eagle
an
and
a
sea
eagle
twice
as
high
as
the
boy
they
were
each
one
of
them
and
they
stood
on
the
rail
of
the
ship
like
soldiers
all
in
a
row
stern
and
still
and
stiff
while
their
great
gleaming
black
eyes
shot
darting
glances
here
and
there
and
everywhere
was
scared
of
them
and
got
behind
a
barrel
he
said
he
felt
as
though
those
terrible
eyes
were
looking
right
inside
of
him
to
see
what
he
had
stolen
for
lunch
and
the
doctor
said
to
the
eagles
a
man
has
been
fisherman
with
red
hair
and
an
anchor
marked
on
his
arm
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
see
if
you
can
find
him
for
us
this
boy
is
the
man
s
eagles
do
not
talk
very
much
and
all
they
answered
in
their
husky
voices
was
you
may
be
sure
that
we
will
do
our
john
then
they
flew
came
out
from
behind
his
barrel
to
see
them
go
up
and
up
and
up
they
and
higher
and
higher
still
then
when
the
doctor
could
only
just
see
them
they
parted
company
and
started
going
off
all
different
east
south
and
west
looking
like
tiny
grains
of
black
sand
creeping
across
the
wide
blue
sky
my
gracious
said
in
a
hushed
voice
what
a
height
i
wonder
they
don
t
scorch
their
near
the
sun
they
were
gone
a
long
time
and
when
they
came
back
it
was
almost
night
and
the
eagles
said
to
the
doctor
we
have
searched
all
the
seas
and
all
the
countries
and
all
the
islands
and
all
the
cities
and
all
the
villages
in
this
half
of
the
world
but
we
have
failed
in
the
main
street
of
gibraltar
we
saw
three
red
hairs
lying
on
a
wheelbarrow
before
a
baker
s
door
but
they
were
not
the
hairs
of
a
were
the
hairs
out
of
a
nowhere
on
land
or
water
could
we
see
any
sign
of
this
boy
s
uncle
and
if
could
not
see
him
then
he
is
not
to
be
seen
for
john
have
done
our
then
the
six
great
birds
flapped
their
big
wings
and
flew
back
to
their
homes
in
the
mountains
and
the
rocks
well
said
after
they
had
gone
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
the
boy
s
uncle
be
s
no
two
ways
about
that
the
lad
isn
t
old
enough
to
be
knocking
around
the
world
by
himself
boys
aren
t
like
have
to
be
taken
care
of
till
they
re
quite
old
i
wish
were
here
he
would
soon
find
the
man
good
old
i
wonder
how
he
s
getting
on
if
we
only
had
polynesia
with
us
said
the
white
mouse
would
soon
think
of
some
way
do
you
remember
how
she
got
us
all
out
of
second
time
my
but
she
was
a
clever
one
i
don
t
think
so
much
of
those
said
jip
they
re
just
conceited
they
may
have
very
good
eyesight
and
all
that
but
when
you
ask
them
to
find
a
man
for
you
they
can
t
do
they
have
the
cheek
to
come
back
and
say
that
nobody
else
could
do
it
they
re
just
that
collie
in
puddleby
and
i
don
t
think
a
whole
lot
of
those
gossipy
old
porpoises
either
all
they
could
tell
us
was
that
the
man
isn
t
in
the
sea
we
don
t
want
to
know
where
he
want
to
know
where
he
oh
don
t
talk
so
much
said
it
s
easy
to
talk
but
it
isn
t
so
easy
to
find
a
man
when
you
have
got
the
whole
world
to
hunt
him
in
maybe
the
fisherman
s
hair
has
turned
white
worrying
about
the
boy
and
that
was
why
the
eagles
didn
t
find
him
you
don
t
know
everything
you
re
just
talking
you
are
not
doing
anything
to
help
you
couldn
t
find
the
boy
s
uncle
any
more
than
the
eagles
couldn
t
do
as
illustration
you
stupid
piece
of
warm
bacon
couldn
t
i
said
the
dog
that
s
all
you
know
you
stupid
piece
of
warm
bacon
i
haven
t
begun
to
try
yet
have
i
you
wait
and
see
then
jip
went
to
the
doctor
and
said
ask
the
boy
if
he
has
anything
in
his
pockets
that
belonged
to
his
uncle
will
you
please
so
the
doctor
asked
him
and
the
boy
showed
them
a
gold
ring
which
he
wore
on
a
piece
of
string
around
his
neck
because
it
was
too
big
for
his
finger
he
said
his
uncle
gave
it
to
him
when
they
saw
the
pirates
coming
jip
smelt
the
ring
and
said
that
s
no
good
ask
him
if
he
has
anything
else
that
belonged
to
his
then
the
boy
took
from
his
pocket
a
great
big
red
handkerchief
and
said
this
was
my
uncle
s
as
soon
as
the
boy
pulled
it
out
jip
shouted
by
jingo
rappee
snuff
don
t
you
smell
it
his
uncle
took
him
the
doctor
questioned
the
boy
again
and
he
said
yes
my
uncle
took
a
lot
of
fine
said
jip
the
man
s
as
good
as
found
twill
be
as
easy
as
stealing
milk
from
a
kitten
tell
the
boy
i
ll
find
his
uncle
for
him
in
less
than
a
week
let
us
go
upstairs
and
see
which
way
the
wind
is
but
it
is
dark
now
said
the
doctor
you
can
t
find
him
in
the
dark
i
don
t
need
any
light
to
look
for
a
man
who
smells
of
black
rappee
snuff
said
jip
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
if
the
man
had
a
hard
smell
like
string
hot
water
it
would
be
different
but
tut
does
hot
water
have
a
smell
asked
the
doctor
certainly
it
has
said
jip
hot
water
smells
quite
different
from
cold
water
it
is
warm
has
the
really
difficult
smell
why
i
once
followed
a
man
for
ten
miles
on
a
dark
night
by
the
smell
of
the
hot
water
he
had
used
to
shave
the
poor
fellow
had
no
soap
now
then
let
us
see
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
wind
is
very
important
in
smelling
it
mustn
t
be
too
fierce
a
of
course
it
must
blow
the
right
way
a
nice
steady
damp
breeze
is
the
best
of
all
ha
wind
is
from
the
then
jip
went
up
to
the
front
of
the
ship
and
smelt
the
wind
and
he
started
muttering
to
himself
tar
spanish
onions
kerosene
oil
wet
raincoats
crushed
rubber
burning
being
my
mistake
hanging
out
to
dry
and
of
can
you
really
smell
all
those
different
things
in
this
one
wind
asked
the
doctor
why
of
course
said
jip
and
those
are
only
a
few
of
the
easy
strong
ones
any
mongrel
could
smell
those
with
a
cold
in
the
head
wait
now
and
i
ll
tell
you
some
of
the
harder
scents
that
are
coming
on
this
few
of
the
dainty
then
the
dog
shut
his
eyes
tight
poked
his
nose
straight
up
in
the
air
and
sniffed
hard
with
his
mouth
for
a
long
time
he
said
nothing
he
kept
as
still
as
a
stone
he
hardly
seemed
to
be
breathing
at
all
when
at
last
he
began
to
speak
it
sounded
almost
as
though
he
were
singing
sadly
in
a
dream
bricks
he
whispered
very
old
yellow
bricks
crumbling
with
age
in
a
the
sweet
breath
of
young
cows
standing
in
a
the
lead
roof
of
a
perhaps
a
the
sun
on
it
black
kid
gloves
lying
in
a
of
a
dusty
road
with
a
horses
beneath
the
sycamores
little
mushrooms
bursting
through
the
rotting
leaves
any
parsnips
asked
no
said
jip
you
always
think
of
things
to
eat
no
parsnips
whatever
and
no
of
pipes
and
cigarettes
and
a
few
cigars
but
no
snuff
we
must
wait
till
the
wind
changes
to
the
yes
it
s
a
poor
wind
that
said
i
think
you
re
a
fake
jip
who
ever
heard
of
finding
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
just
by
smell
i
told
you
you
couldn
t
do
look
here
said
jip
getting
really
angry
you
re
going
to
get
a
bite
on
the
nose
in
a
minute
you
needn
t
think
that
just
because
the
doctor
won
t
let
us
give
you
what
you
deserve
that
you
can
be
as
cheeky
as
you
like
stop
quarreling
said
the
stop
it
life
s
too
short
tell
me
jip
where
do
you
think
those
smells
are
coming
from
from
devon
and
of
them
said
the
wind
is
coming
that
well
well
said
the
doctor
you
know
that
s
really
quite
i
must
make
a
note
of
that
for
my
new
book
i
wonder
if
you
could
train
me
to
smell
as
well
as
that
but
i
m
better
off
the
way
i
am
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
they
say
let
s
go
down
to
supper
i
m
quite
so
am
i
said
nineteenth
the
rock
up
they
got
early
next
morning
out
of
the
silken
beds
and
they
saw
that
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
that
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
south
jip
smelt
the
south
wind
for
half
an
hour
then
he
came
to
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
i
smell
no
snuff
as
yet
he
said
we
must
wait
till
the
wind
changes
to
the
but
even
when
the
east
wind
came
at
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
the
dog
could
not
catch
the
smell
of
snuff
the
little
boy
was
terribly
disappointed
and
began
to
cry
again
saying
that
no
one
seemed
to
be
able
to
find
his
uncle
for
him
but
all
jip
said
to
the
doctor
was
tell
him
that
when
the
wind
changes
to
the
west
i
ll
find
his
uncle
even
though
he
be
in
long
as
he
is
still
taking
black
rappee
three
days
they
had
to
wait
before
the
west
wind
came
this
was
on
a
friday
morning
as
it
was
getting
light
a
fine
rainy
mist
lay
on
the
sea
like
a
thin
fog
and
the
wind
was
soft
and
warm
and
wet
illustration
doctor
he
cried
i
ve
got
it
as
soon
as
jip
awoke
he
ran
upstairs
and
poked
his
nose
in
the
air
then
he
got
most
frightfully
excited
and
rushed
down
again
to
wake
the
doctor
up
doctor
he
cried
i
ve
got
it
doctor
doctor
wake
up
listen
i
ve
got
it
the
wind
s
from
the
west
and
it
smells
of
nothing
but
snuff
come
upstairs
and
start
the
so
the
doctor
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
rudder
to
steer
the
ship
now
i
ll
go
up
to
the
front
said
jip
and
you
watch
my
way
i
point
it
you
turn
the
ship
the
same
way
the
man
can
not
be
far
the
smell
as
strong
as
this
and
the
wind
s
all
lovely
and
wet
now
watch
me
so
all
that
morning
jip
stood
in
the
front
part
of
the
ship
sniffing
the
wind
and
pointing
the
way
for
the
doctor
to
steer
while
all
the
animals
and
the
little
boy
stood
round
with
their
eyes
wide
open
watching
the
dog
in
wonder
about
jip
asked
to
tell
the
doctor
that
he
was
getting
worried
and
wanted
to
speak
to
him
so
went
and
fetched
the
doctor
from
the
other
end
of
the
ship
and
jip
said
to
him
the
boy
s
uncle
is
starving
we
must
make
the
ship
go
as
fast
as
we
how
do
you
know
he
is
starving
asked
the
doctor
because
there
is
no
other
smell
in
the
west
wind
but
snuff
said
jip
if
the
man
were
cooking
or
eating
food
of
any
kind
i
would
be
bound
to
smell
it
too
but
he
hasn
t
even
fresh
water
to
drink
all
he
is
taking
is
large
pinches
we
are
getting
nearer
to
him
all
the
time
because
the
smell
grows
stronger
every
minute
but
make
the
ship
go
as
fast
as
you
can
for
i
am
certain
that
the
man
is
all
right
said
the
doctor
and
he
sent
to
ask
the
swallows
to
pull
the
ship
the
same
as
they
had
done
when
the
pirates
were
chasing
them
so
the
stout
little
birds
came
down
and
once
more
harnessed
themselves
to
the
ship
and
now
the
boat
went
bounding
through
the
waves
at
a
terrible
speed
it
went
so
fast
that
the
fishes
in
the
sea
had
to
jump
for
their
lives
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
not
be
run
over
and
all
the
animals
got
tremendously
excited
and
they
gave
up
looking
at
jip
and
turned
to
watch
the
sea
in
front
to
spy
out
any
land
or
islands
where
the
starving
man
might
be
but
hour
after
hour
went
by
and
still
the
ship
went
rushing
on
over
the
same
flat
flat
sea
and
no
land
anywhere
came
in
sight
and
now
the
animals
gave
up
chattering
and
sat
around
silent
anxious
and
miserable
the
little
boy
again
grew
sad
and
on
jip
s
face
there
was
a
worried
look
at
last
late
in
the
afternoon
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
the
owl
who
was
perched
on
the
tip
of
the
mast
suddenly
startled
them
all
by
crying
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
jip
jip
i
see
a
great
great
rock
in
front
of
out
there
where
the
sky
and
the
water
meet
see
the
sun
shine
on
gold
is
the
smell
coming
from
there
and
jip
called
back
yes
that
s
it
that
is
where
the
man
last
at
last
and
when
they
got
nearer
they
could
see
that
the
rock
was
very
large
as
a
big
field
no
trees
grew
on
it
no
the
great
rock
was
as
smooth
and
as
bare
as
the
back
of
a
tortoise
then
the
doctor
sailed
the
ship
right
round
the
rock
but
nowhere
on
it
could
a
man
be
seen
all
the
animals
screwed
up
their
eyes
and
looked
as
hard
as
they
could
and
john
dolittle
got
a
telescope
from
downstairs
but
not
one
living
thing
could
they
even
a
gull
nor
a
nor
a
shred
of
they
all
stood
still
and
listened
straining
their
ears
for
any
sound
but
the
only
noise
they
heard
was
the
gentle
lapping
of
the
little
waves
against
the
sides
of
their
ship
then
they
all
started
calling
hulloa
there
till
their
voices
were
hoarse
but
only
the
echo
came
back
from
the
rock
and
the
little
boy
burst
into
tears
and
said
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
see
my
uncle
any
more
what
shall
i
tell
them
when
i
get
home
but
jip
called
to
the
doctor
he
must
be
the
smell
goes
on
no
further
he
must
be
there
i
tell
you
sail
the
ship
close
to
the
rock
and
let
me
jump
out
on
so
the
doctor
brought
the
ship
as
close
as
he
could
and
let
down
the
anchor
then
he
and
jip
got
out
of
the
ship
on
to
the
rock
jip
at
once
put
his
nose
down
close
to
the
ground
and
began
to
run
all
over
the
place
up
and
down
he
went
back
and
twisting
doubling
and
turning
and
everywhere
he
went
the
doctor
ran
behind
him
close
at
his
he
was
terribly
out
of
breath
at
last
jip
let
out
a
great
bark
and
sat
down
and
when
the
doctor
came
running
up
to
him
he
found
the
dog
staring
into
a
big
deep
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
rock
the
boy
s
uncle
is
down
there
said
jip
quietly
no
wonder
those
silly
eagles
couldn
t
see
him
takes
a
dog
to
find
a
so
the
doctor
got
down
into
the
hole
which
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
cave
or
tunnel
running
a
long
way
under
the
ground
then
he
struck
a
match
and
started
to
make
his
way
along
the
dark
passage
with
jip
following
behind
the
doctor
s
match
soon
went
out
and
he
had
to
strike
another
and
another
and
another
at
last
the
passage
came
to
an
end
and
the
doctor
found
himself
in
a
kind
of
tiny
room
with
walls
of
rock
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
head
resting
on
his
arms
lay
a
man
with
very
red
asleep
jip
went
up
and
sniffed
at
something
lying
on
the
ground
beside
him
the
doctor
stooped
and
picked
it
up
it
was
an
enormous
and
it
was
full
of
black
rappee
twentieth
the
fisherman
s
town
gently
gently
the
doctor
woke
the
man
up
but
just
at
that
moment
the
match
went
out
again
and
the
man
thought
it
was
ben
ali
coming
back
and
he
began
to
punch
the
doctor
in
the
dark
but
when
john
dolittle
told
him
who
it
was
and
that
he
had
his
little
nephew
safe
on
his
ship
the
man
was
tremendously
glad
and
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
fought
the
doctor
he
had
not
hurt
him
much
it
was
too
dark
to
punch
properly
then
he
gave
the
doctor
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
the
man
told
how
the
barbary
dragon
had
put
him
on
to
this
rock
and
left
him
there
when
he
wouldn
t
promise
to
become
a
pirate
and
how
he
used
to
sleep
down
in
this
hole
because
there
was
no
house
on
the
rock
to
keep
him
warm
and
then
he
said
for
four
days
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
i
have
lived
on
there
you
are
said
jip
what
did
i
tell
you
so
they
struck
some
more
matches
and
made
their
way
out
through
the
passage
into
the
daylight
and
the
doctor
hurried
the
man
down
to
the
boat
to
get
some
soup
when
the
animals
and
the
little
boy
saw
the
doctor
and
jip
coming
back
to
the
ship
with
a
man
they
began
to
cheer
and
yell
and
dance
about
the
boat
and
the
swallows
up
above
started
whistling
at
the
top
of
their
and
millions
of
show
that
they
too
were
glad
that
the
boy
s
brave
uncle
had
been
found
the
noise
they
made
was
so
great
that
sailors
far
out
at
sea
thought
that
a
terrible
storm
was
coming
hark
to
that
gale
howling
in
the
east
they
said
and
jip
was
awfully
proud
of
he
tried
hard
not
to
look
conceited
when
came
to
him
and
said
jip
i
had
no
idea
you
were
so
clever
he
just
tossed
his
head
and
answered
oh
that
s
nothing
special
but
it
takes
a
dog
to
find
a
man
you
know
birds
are
no
good
for
a
game
like
then
the
doctor
asked
the
fisherman
where
his
home
was
and
when
he
had
told
him
the
doctor
asked
the
swallows
to
guide
the
ship
there
first
and
when
they
had
come
to
the
land
which
the
man
had
spoken
of
they
saw
a
little
at
the
foot
of
a
rocky
mountain
and
the
man
pointed
out
the
house
where
he
lived
and
while
they
were
letting
down
the
anchor
the
little
boy
s
mother
who
was
also
the
man
s
sister
came
running
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
them
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
hill
for
twenty
days
watching
the
sea
and
waiting
for
them
to
return
and
she
kissed
the
doctor
many
times
so
that
he
giggled
and
blushed
like
a
and
she
tried
to
kiss
jip
too
but
he
ran
away
and
hid
inside
the
ship
it
s
a
silly
business
this
kissing
he
said
i
don
t
hold
by
it
let
her
go
and
kiss
she
kiss
illustration
and
she
kissed
the
doctor
many
times
the
fisherman
and
his
sister
didn
t
want
the
doctor
to
go
away
again
in
a
hurry
they
begged
him
to
spend
a
few
days
with
them
so
john
dolittle
and
his
animals
had
to
stay
at
their
house
a
whole
saturday
and
sunday
and
half
of
monday
and
all
the
little
boys
of
the
went
down
to
the
beach
and
pointed
at
the
great
ship
anchored
there
and
said
to
one
another
in
whispers

a
ali
most
terrible
pirate
that

most
kind
i
shall

just
as
the
doctor
was
about
to
leave

mayor
of
the
town
came
down
the
street
and
a
lot
of
other
people
in
grand
clothes
with
him
and
the
mayor
stopped
before
the
house
where
the
doctor
was
living
and
everybody
in
the
village
gathered
round
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
after

trumpets
to
make
the
people

the
doctor
came
out
on
to
the
steps
and
the
mayor
spoke
doctor
john
dolittle
said
he
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for

this
little
token
from
the
grateful
people
of

the

took
from
his
pocket
a
little
packet
and
opening
it
he
handed
to
the
doctor
a
perfectly
beautiful
watch
with
real
diamonds
in
the
back
then
the
mayor
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
still
larger
parcel
and
said
where
is
the
dog
then
everybody
started
to
hunt
for
jip
and
at
last
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
in
a
where
all
the
dogs
of
the
were
standing
round
him
speechless
with
admiration
and
respect
when
jip
was
brought
to
the
doctor
s
side
the
mayor
opened
the
larger
parcel
and
inside
was
a
made
of
solid
gold
and
a
great
murmur
of
wonder
went
up
from
the
as
the
mayor
bent
down
and
fastened
it
round
the
dog
s
neck
with
his
own
hands
for
written
on
the
collar
in
big
letters
were
these
words
cleverest
dog
in
the
then
the
whole
crowd
moved
down
to
the
beach
to
see
them
off
and
after
the
fisherman
and
his
sister
and
the
little
boy
had
thanked
the
doctor
and
his
dog
over
and
over
and
over
again
the
great
swift
ship
with
the
red
sails
was
turned
once
more
towards
puddleby
and
they
sailed
out
to

april
s
showers

buds
had
opened
into

and
the
june
sun
was
shining
on
the
pleasant
fields
when
john
dolittle
at
last
got
back
to
his
own
country
but
he
did
not
yet
go
home
to
puddleby
first
he
went
traveling
through
the
land
with
the
in
a
stopping
at
all
the
and
there
with
the
acrobats
on
one
side
of
them
and
the
show
on
the

big
sign
which
read

the
marvelous
animal
from
the
jungles
of
africa
admission
and
the
would
stay
inside
the
wagon
while
the
other
animals
would
lie
about
underneath
the
doctor
sat
in
a
chair
in
front
taking
the
sixpences
and
smiling
on
the
people
as
they
went
in
and
was
kept
busy
all
the
time
scolding
him
because
he
would
let
the
children
in
for
nothing
when
she
wasn
t
looking
and
and
came
and
asked
the
doctor
to
sell
them
the
strange
creature
saying
they
would
pay
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
for
him
but
the
doctor
always
shook
his
head
and
said
no
the
shall
never
be
shut
up
in
a
cage
he
shall
be
free
always
to
come
and
go
like
you
and
many
curious
sights
and
happenings
they
saw
in
this
wandering
life
but
they
all
seemed
quite
ordinary
after
the
great
things
they
had
seen
and
done
in
foreign
lands
it
was
very
interesting
at
first
being
sort
of
part
of
a
circus
but
after
a
few
weeks
they
all
got
dreadfully
tired
of
it
and
the
doctor
and
all
of
them
were
longing
to
go
home
illustration
the
doctor
sat
in
a
chair
in
front
but
so
many
people
came
flocking
to
the
little
wagon
and
paid
the
sixpence
to
go
inside
and
see
the
that
very
soon
the
doctor
was
able
to
give
up
being
a
showman
and
one
fine
day
when
the
hollyhocks
were
in
full
bloom
he
came
back
to
puddleby
a
rich
man
to
live
in
the
little
house
with
the
big
garden
and
the
old
lame
horse
in
the
stable
was
glad
to
see
him
and
so
were
the
swallows
who
had
already
built
their
nests
under
the
eaves
of
his
roof
and
had
young
ones
and
was
glad
too
to
get
back
to
the
house
she
knew
so
there
was
a
terrible
lot
of
dusting
to
be
done
with
cobwebs
everywhere
and
after
jip
had
gone
and
shown
his
golden
collar
to
the
conceited
collie
he
came
back
and
began
running
round
the
garden
like
a
crazy
thing
looking
for
the
bones
he
had
buried
long
ago
and
chasing
the
rats
out
of
the
while
dug
up
the
horseradish
which
had
grown
three
feet
high
in
the
corner
by
the
illustration
he
began
running
round
the
garden
like
a
crazy
thing
and
the
doctor
went
and
saw
the
sailor
who
had
lent
him
the
boat
and
he
bought
two
new
ships
for
him
and
a
for
his
baby
and
he
paid
the
grocer
for
the
food
he
had
lent
him
for
the
journey
to
africa
and
he
bought
another
piano
and
put
the
white
mice
back
in
they
said
the
was
drafty
even
when
the
doctor
had
filled
the
old
on
the
he
still
had
a
lot
of
money
left
and
he
had
to
get
three
more
just
as
big
to
put
the
rest
in
money
he
said
is
a
terrible
nuisance
but
it
s
nice
not
to
have
to
yes
said
who
was
toasting
muffins
for
his
tea
it
is
indeed
and
when
the
winter
came
again
and
the
snow
flew
against
the
the
doctor
and
his
animals
would
sit
round
the
big
warm
fire
after
supper
and
he
would
read
aloud
to
them
out
of
his
books
but
far
away
in
africa
where
the
monkeys
chattered
in
the
before
they
went
to
bed
under
the
big
yellow
moon
they
would
say
to
one
another
i
wonder
what
the
good
man
s
doing
there
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
do
you
think
he
ever
will
come
back
and
polynesia
would
squeak
out
from
the
vines
i
think
he
guess
he
hope
he
will
and
then
the
crocodile
would
grunt
up
at
them
from
the
black
mud
of
the
river
i
m
sure
he
to
sleep
