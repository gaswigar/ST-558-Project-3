the
adventures
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
i
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
runs
for
his
life
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
had
been
scolding
because
there
was
no
excitement
he
had
even
tried
to
make
some
excitement
by
waking
bobby
coon
and
making
him
so
angry
that
bobby
had
threatened
to
eat
him
alive
it
had
been
great
fun
to
dance
around
and
call
bobby
names
and
make
fun
of
him
oh
yes
it
had
been
great
fun
you
see
he
knew
all
the
time
that
bobby
could
catch
him
if
he
should
try
but
now
things
were
different
chatterer
had
all
the
excitement
that
he
wanted
indeed
he
had
more
than
he
wanted
the
truth
is
chatterer
was
running
for
his
life
and
he
knew
it
it
is
a
terrible
thing
a
very
terrible
thing
to
have
to
run
for
life
peter
rabbit
knows
all
about
it
he
has
run
for
his
life
often
sometimes
it
has
been
reddy
fox
behind
him
sometimes
bowser
the
hound
and
once
or
twice
old
man
coyote
peter
has
known
that
on
his
long
legs
his
life
has
depended
and
more
than
once
a
terrible
fear
has
filled
his
heart
but
peter
has
also
known
that
if
he
could
reach
the
old
stone
wall
or
the
dear
old
first
he
would
be
safe
and
he
always
has
reached
it
so
when
he
has
been
running
with
that
terrible
fear
in
his
heart
there
has
always
been
hope
there
too
but
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
was
running
without
hope
yes
sir
there
was
nothing
but
fear
terrible
fear
in
his
heart
for
he
knew
not
where
to
go
the
hollow
tree
or
the
holes
in
the
old
stone
wall
where
he
would
be
safe
from
any
one
else
even
farmer
brown
boy
offered
him
no
safety
now
for
the
one
who
was
following
him
with
hunger
in
his
eyes
could
go
anywhere
that
he
could
go
could
go
into
any
hole
big
enough
for
him
to
squeeze
into
you
see
it
was
shadow
the
weasel
from
whom
chatterer
was
running
and
shadow
is
so
slim
that
he
can
slip
in
and
out
of
places
that
even
chatterer
can
not
get
through
chatterer
knew
all
this
and
so
because
it
was
of
no
use
to
run
to
his
usual
safe
hiding
places
he
ran
in
just
the
other
direction
he
know
where
he
was
going
he
had
just
one
thought
to
run
and
run
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
well
he
would
try
to
fight
though
he
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
sobbed
as
he
ran
out
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
leaped
across
to
the
next
tree
i
wish
i
had
minded
my
own
business
i
wish
i
had
kept
my
tongue
still
shadow
the
weasel
have
known
where
i
was
if
he
had
heard
my
voice
oh
dear
oh
dear
me
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
now
in
his
great
fright
chatterer
had
run
and
jumped
so
hard
that
he
was
beginning
to
grow
very
tired
presently
he
found
that
he
must
make
a
very
long
jump
to
reach
the
next
tree
he
had
often
made
as
long
a
jump
as
this
and
thought
nothing
of
it
but
now
he
was
so
tired
that
the
distance
looked
twice
as
great
as
it
really
was
he
did
dare
stop
to
run
down
the
tree
and
scamper
across
so
he
took
a
long
breath
ran
swiftly
along
the
branch
and
leaped
his
hands
just
touched
the
tip
of
the
nearest
branch
of
the
other
tree
he
tried
his
very
best
to
hold
on
but
he
could
then
down
down
down
he
fell
he
spread
himself
out
as
flat
as
he
could
and
that
saved
him
a
little
but
still
it
was
a
dreadful
fall
and
when
he
landed
it
seemed
for
just
a
minute
as
if
all
the
breath
was
gone
from
his
body
but
it
was
quite
and
in
another
minute
he
was
scrambling
up
the
tree
ii
chatterer
last
chance
chatterer
still
running
for
his
life
and
without
the
least
hope
suddenly
saw
a
last
chance
to
escape
from
shadow
the
weasel
that
is
he
saw
something
that
might
offer
him
a
chance
he
could
be
sure
until
he
had
tried
and
even
then
he
might
escape
from
one
danger
only
to
run
right
into
another
equally
great
what
chatterer
saw
was
a
big
brown
bunch
near
the
top
of
a
tall
and
he
headed
for
that
tree
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
go
what
was
that
big
brown
bunch
why
it
was
redtail
the
hawk
who
was
dozing
there
with
his
head
drawn
down
between
his
shoulders
dreaming
now
old
redtail
is
one
of
chatterer
deadliest
enemies
he
is
quite
as
fond
of
red
squirrel
as
is
shadow
the
weasel
though
he
does
often
try
to
catch
one
because
there
are
other
things
to
eat
much
easier
to
get
chatterer
had
had
more
than
one
narrow
escape
from
old
redtail
and
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
yet
here
he
was
running
up
the
very
tree
in
which
redtail
was
sitting
you
see
a
very
daring
idea
had
come
into
his
head
he
had
seen
at
once
that
redtail
was
dozing
and
had
seen
him
at
all
he
knew
that
redtail
would
just
as
soon
have
shadow
the
weasel
for
dinner
as
himself
and
a
very
daring
plan
had
popped
into
his
head
i
may
as
well
be
caught
by
redtail
as
shadow
he
thought
as
he
ran
up
the
tree
but
if
my
plan
works
out
right
i
wo
be
caught
by
either
anyway
it
is
my
very
last
chance
up
the
tree
he
scrambled
and
after
him
went
shadow
the
weasel
shadow
had
been
so
intent
on
catching
chatterer
that
he
had
not
noticed
old
redtail
which
was
just
as
chatterer
had
hoped
up
up
he
scrambled
straight
past
old
redtail
but
as
he
passed
he
pulled
one
of
long
tail
feathers
and
then
ran
on
to
the
top
of
the
tree
and
with
the
last
bit
of
strength
he
had
left
leaped
to
a
neighboring
where
hidden
by
the
thick
branches
he
stopped
to
rest
and
see
what
would
happen
of
course
when
he
felt
his
tail
pulled
old
redtail
was
wide
awake
in
a
flash
and
of
course
he
looked
down
to
see
who
had
dared
to
pull
his
tail
there
just
below
him
was
shadow
the
weasel
who
had
just
that
minute
discovered
who
was
sitting
there
old
redtail
hissed
sharply
and
the
feathers
on
the
top
of
his
head
stood
up
in
a
way
they
do
when
he
is
angry
and
he
was
angry
very
angry
shadow
the
weasel
stopped
short
then
like
a
flash
he
dodged
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
tree
he
had
no
thought
of
chatterer
now
things
were
changed
all
in
an
instant
quite
changed
instead
of
the
hunter
he
was
now
the
hunted
old
redtail
circled
in
the
air
just
overhead
and
every
time
he
caught
sight
of
shadow
he
swooped
at
him
with
great
cruel
claws
spread
to
clutch
him
shadow
dodged
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
he
was
more
angry
than
frightened
for
his
sharp
eyes
had
spied
a
little
hollow
in
a
branch
of
the
and
he
knew
that
once
inside
of
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
fear
but
he
was
angry
clear
through
to
think
that
he
should
be
cheated
out
of
that
dinner
he
had
been
so
sure
of
only
a
few
minutes
before
so
he
screeched
angrily
at
old
redtail
and
then
watching
his
chance
scampered
out
to
the
hollow
and
whisked
inside
just
in
the
nick
of
time
chatterer
watching
from
the
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
he
saw
redtail
the
hawk
post
himself
on
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
where
he
could
keep
watch
of
that
hollow
in
which
shadow
had
disappeared
and
he
knew
that
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
shadow
would
dare
poke
even
his
nose
outside
then
as
soon
as
he
was
rested
chatterer
stole
softly
oh
so
softly
away
through
the
until
he
was
sure
that
redtail
could
not
see
him
then
he
hurried
he
wanted
to
get
just
as
far
away
from
shadow
the
weasel
as
he
could
iii
chatterer
tells
sammy
jay
about
shadow
the
weasel
chatterer
hurried
through
the
green
forest
he
did
know
just
where
he
was
going
he
had
but
one
thought
and
that
was
to
get
as
far
away
from
shadow
the
weasel
as
he
could
it
made
him
have
cold
shivers
all
over
every
time
he
thought
of
shadow
seems
to
me
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
said
a
voice
from
a
he
was
passing
chatterer
knew
that
voice
without
looking
to
see
who
was
speaking
everybody
in
the
green
forest
knows
that
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
sammy
jay
it
looks
to
me
as
if
you
were
running
away
from
some
one
jeered
sammy
chatterer
wanted
to
stop
and
pick
a
quarrel
with
sammy
as
he
usually
did
when
they
met
but
the
fear
of
shadow
the
weasel
was
still
upon
him
i
i
am
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
sammy
looked
as
if
he
thought
he
had
heard
right
never
before
had
he
known
chatterer
to
admit
that
he
was
afraid
for
you
know
chatterer
is
a
great
boaster
it
must
be
something
very
serious
to
frighten
chatterer
like
that
what
that
sammy
asked
sharply
i
always
knew
you
to
be
a
coward
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
known
you
to
admit
it
who
are
you
running
away
from
illustration
what
that
sammy
asked
sharply
shadow
the
weasel
replied
chatterer
still
in
a
very
low
voice
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
overheard
shadow
the
weasel
is
back
in
the
green
forest
and
i
have
just
had
such
a
narrow
escape
ho
cried
sammy
this
is
important
i
thought
shadow
was
up
in
the
old
pasture
if
he
has
come
back
to
the
green
forest
folks
ought
to
know
it
where
is
he
now
chatterer
stopped
and
told
sammy
all
about
his
narrow
escape
and
how
he
had
left
shadow
the
weasel
in
a
hollow
of
a
with
redtail
the
hawk
watching
for
him
to
come
out
sammy
eyes
sparkled
when
chatterer
told
how
he
had
pulled
the
tail
of
old
redtail
and
he
does
know
now
who
did
it
he
thinks
it
was
shadow
concluded
chatterer
with
a
weak
little
grin
ho
ho
ho
ha
ha
ha
laughed
sammy
jay
i
wish
i
had
been
there
to
see
it
then
he
suddenly
grew
grave
other
folks
certainly
ought
to
know
that
shadow
is
back
in
the
green
forest
said
he
so
that
they
may
be
on
their
guard
then
if
they
get
caught
it
is
their
own
fault
i
think
i
go
spread
the
news
you
see
for
all
his
mean
ways
sammy
jay
does
have
some
good
in
him
just
as
everybody
does
and
he
dearly
loves
to
tell
important
news
i
i
wish
you
would
go
first
of
all
and
tell
my
cousin
happy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
said
chatterer
speaking
in
a
hesitating
way
sammy
jay
leaned
over
and
looked
at
chatterer
sharply
i
thought
you
and
happy
jack
were
not
friends
said
he
you
always
seem
to
be
quarreling
chatterer
looked
a
little
confused
but
he
is
very
quick
with
his
tongue
is
chatterer
that
just
it
he
replied
quickly
that
just
it
if
anything
should
happen
to
happy
jack
i
would
have
him
to
quarrel
with
and
it
is
such
fun
to
see
him
get
mad
now
of
course
the
real
reason
why
chatterer
wanted
happy
jack
warned
was
because
down
inside
he
was
ashamed
of
a
dreadful
thought
that
had
come
to
him
of
leading
shadow
the
weasel
to
happy
jack
house
so
that
he
himself
might
escape
it
had
been
a
dreadful
thought
a
cowardly
thought
and
chatterer
had
been
really
ashamed
that
he
should
have
ever
had
such
a
thought
he
thought
now
that
if
he
could
do
something
for
happy
jack
he
would
feel
better
about
it
sammy
jay
promised
to
go
straight
to
happy
jack
and
warn
him
that
shadow
the
weasel
was
back
in
the
green
forest
and
off
he
started
screaming
the
news
as
he
flew
so
that
all
the
little
people
in
the
green
forest
might
know
chatterer
listened
a
few
minutes
and
then
started
on
where
shall
i
go
he
muttered
where
shall
i
go
i
do
dare
stay
in
the
green
forest
for
now
shadow
will
never
rest
until
he
catches
me
iv
chatterer
leaves
the
green
forest
chatterer
was
in
a
peck
of
trouble
yes
sir
he
was
in
a
peck
of
trouble
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
if
only
i
had
kept
my
tongue
still
if
only
i
had
kept
my
tongue
still
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
as
he
hurried
through
the
green
forest
you
see
chatterer
was
just
beginning
to
realize
what
a
lot
of
trouble
an
unruly
tongue
can
get
one
into
here
it
was
cold
weather
the
very
edge
of
winter
and
chatterer
did
dare
stay
in
the
green
forest
where
he
had
always
made
his
home
his
storehouses
were
full
of
nuts
and
seeds
and
corn
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
keep
him
in
comfort
all
winter
and
now
he
must
turn
his
back
on
them
and
go
he
did
know
where
and
all
because
of
his
mean
disposition
and
bad
tongue
if
he
had
called
bobby
coon
names
that
morning
at
the
top
of
his
voice
shadow
the
weasel
might
not
have
found
him
he
knew
that
shadow
has
a
long
memory
and
that
he
would
never
forget
the
trick
by
which
chatterer
had
escaped
and
so
the
only
way
chatterer
would
ever
be
able
to
have
a
moment
peace
would
be
to
leave
the
green
forest
for
as
long
as
shadow
the
weasel
chose
to
stay
there
chatterer
shivered
inside
his
warm
red
fur
coat
as
he
thought
of
the
long
cold
winter
and
how
hard
it
would
be
to
find
enough
to
eat
was
ever
any
one
else
in
such
a
dreadful
fix
presently
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
he
sat
down
to
rest
in
the
top
of
a
tree
where
he
could
look
off
over
the
green
meadows
far
far
away
he
could
see
the
purple
hills
behind
which
jolly
round
red
sun
goes
to
bed
every
night
he
could
see
the
old
stone
wall
that
separates
farmer
brown
cornfield
from
the
green
meadows
he
could
see
farmer
brown
house
and
barn
and
near
them
the
old
orchard
where
johnny
chuck
had
spent
the
summer
with
polly
chuck
and
their
baby
chucks
he
knew
every
nook
and
corner
in
the
old
stone
wall
and
many
times
he
had
been
to
the
old
orchard
it
was
there
that
he
had
stolen
the
eggs
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
he
grinned
at
the
thought
of
those
eggs
and
how
he
had
stolen
them
and
then
he
shivered
as
he
remembered
how
he
had
finally
been
caught
and
how
sharp
the
bills
of
drummer
and
drummer
were
but
all
that
was
in
the
past
and
thinking
about
it
was
going
to
help
him
now
he
had
got
to
do
something
right
away
perhaps
he
might
find
a
place
to
live
in
the
old
stone
wall
and
there
might
there
just
might
be
enough
grains
of
corn
scattered
over
the
ground
of
the
cornfield
for
him
to
lay
up
a
supply
if
he
worked
very
hard
and
fast
anyway
he
would
have
a
look
so
he
hurried
down
from
the
tree
and
out
along
the
old
stone
wall
his
spirits
began
to
rise
as
he
whisked
along
peering
into
every
hole
and
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
it
really
seemed
as
though
he
might
find
a
snug
home
somewhere
here
then
he
remembered
something
that
made
his
heart
sink
again
he
remembered
having
seen
shadow
the
weasel
more
than
once
exploring
that
very
wall
just
as
likely
as
not
he
would
do
it
again
for
it
was
so
very
near
the
green
forest
no
the
old
stone
wall
would
do
just
then
along
came
peter
rabbit
peter
saw
right
away
that
something
was
wrong
with
chatterer
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
chatterer
told
him
he
felt
that
he
had
just
got
to
tell
some
one
peter
looked
thoughtful
he
scratched
his
long
left
ear
with
his
long
right
hind
foot
you
know
there
is
another
old
stone
wall
up
there
by
the
old
orchard
said
he
it
is
pretty
near
farmer
brown
house
and
black
pussy
hunts
there
a
great
deal
but
you
ought
to
be
smart
enough
to
keep
out
of
her
clutches
i
should
hope
so
exclaimed
chatterer
scornfully
i
have
never
seen
a
cat
yet
that
i
was
afraid
of
believe
i
go
over
and
have
a
look
at
that
old
wall
peter
rabbit
i
go
with
you
said
peter
and
off
they
started
together
v
chatterer
finds
a
home
when
your
plans
are
upset
and
all
scattered
about
just
make
up
your
mind
that
you
find
a
way
out
peter
rabbit
went
straight
over
to
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
so
fast
that
it
did
take
him
long
to
get
there
but
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
never
feels
really
safe
on
the
ground
unless
there
is
something
to
climb
close
at
hand
so
he
went
a
long
way
round
by
way
of
the
rail
fence
he
always
did
like
to
run
along
a
rail
fence
and
he
would
have
minded
it
a
bit
this
morning
if
he
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
never
would
get
there
but
of
course
he
did
when
he
did
get
there
he
found
peter
rabbit
sitting
on
johnny
doorstep
staring
down
johnny
chuck
long
hall
they
asleep
said
he
as
chatterer
came
up
all
out
of
breath
i
thumped
and
thumped
and
thumped
but
it
is
the
least
bit
of
use
they
are
asleep
and
they
stay
asleep
until
mistress
spring
arrives
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
no
sir
i
ca
understand
how
anybody
can
be
willing
to
miss
this
splendid
cold
weather
peter
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
way
and
continued
to
stare
down
the
long
empty
hall
of
course
he
was
talking
about
johnny
and
polly
chuck
who
had
gone
to
sleep
for
the
winter
that
sleeping
business
always
puzzles
peter
it
seems
to
him
like
a
terrible
waste
of
time
but
chatterer
had
too
much
on
his
mind
to
waste
time
wondering
how
other
people
could
sleep
all
winter
he
could
himself
and
now
that
he
had
been
driven
away
from
his
own
home
in
the
green
forest
by
fear
of
shadow
the
weasel
he
could
waste
a
minute
he
must
find
a
new
home
and
then
spend
every
minute
of
daytime
laying
up
a
new
store
of
food
for
the
days
when
everything
would
be
covered
with
snow
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
stone
wall
he
scampered
looking
for
a
place
to
make
a
home
but
nothing
suited
him
you
know
he
likes
best
to
make
his
home
in
a
tree
he
is
like
striped
chipmunk
who
lives
in
the
ground
poor
chatterer
he
just
could
see
how
he
was
going
to
live
in
the
old
stone
wall
he
sat
on
top
of
a
big
stone
to
rest
and
think
it
over
he
was
discouraged
life
did
seem
worth
the
living
just
then
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
had
gone
way
down
to
his
toes
just
then
his
eyes
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
come
up
again
with
a
great
bound
right
where
it
ought
to
be
and
just
then
peter
rabbit
came
hopping
along
have
you
found
a
new
home
yet
asked
peter
yes
replied
chatterer
i
think
i
have
that
good
replied
peter
i
was
sure
you
would
find
one
over
here
where
is
it
illustration
have
you
found
a
new
home
yet
asked
peter
chatterer
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
peter
and
then
closed
it
with
a
snap
he
remembered
just
in
time
how
hard
it
is
for
peter
to
keep
a
secret
if
he
should
tell
peter
it
would
be
just
like
peter
to
tell
some
one
else
without
meaning
to
and
then
it
might
get
back
to
shadow
the
weasel
i
not
going
to
tell
you
now
peter
rabbit
said
he
you
see
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
where
it
is
until
i
am
sure
that
it
will
do
but
i
tell
you
this
much
he
added
as
he
saw
how
disappointed
peter
looked
i
going
to
live
right
here
peter
brightened
up
right
away
you
see
he
thought
that
of
course
chatterer
meant
that
he
had
found
a
hole
in
the
old
stone
wall
and
he
felt
very
sure
that
he
could
find
it
by
keeping
watch
that
good
he
said
again
i
come
see
you
often
but
watch
out
for
black
pussy
her
claws
are
very
sharp
now
i
think
i
be
going
back
to
the
old
do
tell
where
i
am
called
chatterer
vi
peter
rabbit
listens
to
the
wrong
voice
peter
rabbit
did
play
fair
no
sir
peter
did
play
fair
people
who
have
too
much
curiosity
about
other
people
affairs
seldom
do
play
fair
he
did
mean
to
be
unfair
oh
my
no
peter
did
mean
to
be
unfair
when
he
left
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
sitting
on
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
farmer
brown
old
orchard
he
intended
to
go
straight
home
to
the
dear
old
he
was
a
little
disappointed
was
peter
that
chatterer
had
told
him
just
where
his
new
house
was
not
that
it
really
mattered
he
just
wanted
to
know
that
was
all
with
every
jump
away
from
the
old
stone
wall
that
desire
to
know
just
where
chatterer
new
house
was
seemed
to
grow
peter
stopped
and
looked
back
he
could
see
chatterer
now
because
the
bushes
hid
him
and
if
he
could
see
chatterer
why
of
course
chatterer
could
see
him
peter
sat
down
and
began
to
pull
his
whiskers
in
a
way
he
has
when
he
is
trying
to
decide
something
it
seemed
as
if
two
little
voices
were
quarreling
inside
him
go
along
home
like
the
good
fellow
you
are
and
mind
your
own
business
said
one
steal
back
to
the
old
wall
and
watch
chatterer
and
so
find
out
just
where
his
new
house
is
he
never
know
anything
about
it
and
there
be
no
harm
done
said
the
other
little
voice
it
was
louder
than
the
first
voice
and
peter
liked
the
sound
of
it
i
believe
i
will
said
he
and
without
waiting
to
hear
what
the
first
little
voice
would
say
to
that
he
turned
about
and
very
carefully
and
softly
tiptoed
back
to
the
old
stone
wall
right
near
it
was
a
thick
little
bush
it
seemed
to
peter
that
it
must
have
grown
there
just
to
give
him
a
hiding
place
he
crawled
under
it
and
lay
very
flat
he
could
see
along
the
old
stone
wall
in
both
directions
chatterer
was
sitting
just
where
he
had
left
him
he
was
looking
in
the
direction
that
peter
had
gone
when
he
had
said
peter
chuckled
to
himself
waiting
to
make
sure
i
have
gone
before
he
goes
to
that
new
house
of
his
thought
peter
this
is
the
time
i
fool
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
peter
rabbit
this
is
none
of
your
business
said
that
little
small
voice
you
not
doing
a
bit
of
harm
chatterer
has
no
business
to
try
to
keep
his
new
house
a
secret
anyway
said
the
other
little
voice
inside
and
because
of
his
dreadful
curiosity
peter
liked
the
sound
of
that
voice
best
and
listened
to
it
and
after
a
while
the
first
voice
grew
discouraged
and
stopped
chatterer
sat
where
he
was
for
what
seemed
to
peter
a
very
long
time
but
by
and
by
he
gave
a
sudden
funny
little
flirt
of
his
tail
and
ran
along
the
old
wall
a
little
way
then
with
a
hasty
look
around
he
disappeared
in
a
hole
a
minute
later
he
popped
his
head
out
for
another
look
around
and
then
disappeared
again
he
did
this
two
or
three
times
as
if
anxious
peter
chuckled
to
himself
that
his
new
house
right
there
said
he
to
himself
and
now
that
i
know
where
it
is
i
think
i
hurry
along
home
to
the
dear
old
he
was
just
getting
ready
to
start
when
chatterer
popped
out
of
his
hole
and
sat
up
on
a
big
stone
he
was
talking
out
loud
and
peter
listened
then
his
long
ears
began
to
burn
for
this
is
what
he
heard
i
glad
that
peter
not
a
spy
for
spies
are
hateful
as
can
be
it
dreadful
how
some
people
try
affairs
of
other
folks
to
see
chatterer
whisked
out
of
sight
and
peter
hurried
to
get
away
his
ears
still
burned
and
somehow
he
did
feel
so
tickled
over
the
thought
that
he
had
discovered
chatterer
secret
as
he
had
thought
he
would
and
over
in
the
hole
in
the
old
stone
wall
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
was
laughing
as
if
there
was
some
great
joke
there
was
and
the
joke
was
on
peter
rabbit
you
see
he
had
discovered
chatterer
new
house
at
all
vii
how
chatterer
had
fooled
peter
rabbit
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
is
a
scamp
himself
and
not
to
be
trusted
nobody
in
the
green
forest
or
on
the
green
meadows
trusts
him
and
people
who
can
not
be
trusted
themselves
never
trust
any
one
else
chatterer
never
does
he
is
always
suspicious
so
when
peter
rabbit
had
said
and
started
for
the
dear
old
without
knowing
where
chatterer
new
house
was
chatterer
had
made
up
his
mind
right
away
that
peter
would
never
be
satisfied
until
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
where
that
new
house
was
you
see
he
knew
all
about
dreadful
curiosity
he
watched
peter
out
of
sight
then
he
slipped
down
out
of
sight
himself
between
the
stones
of
the
old
wall
i
know
what
peter
will
do
said
he
to
himself
peter
will
come
sneaking
back
and
hide
where
he
can
watch
me
and
so
find
out
where
my
new
house
is
i
just
stay
here
long
enough
to
give
him
a
chance
to
hide
and
then
i
fool
him
you
see
chatterer
knew
that
if
he
had
been
in
peter
place
he
would
have
done
just
that
thing
so
he
waited
a
little
while
and
then
went
back
to
the
place
where
peter
had
left
him
there
he
sat
and
pretended
to
be
looking
in
the
direction
in
which
peter
had
gone
as
if
to
make
sure
that
peter
was
really
on
his
way
home
but
all
the
time
chatterer
was
watching
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
to
see
if
peter
was
hiding
anywhere
near
he
did
see
peter
but
he
did
have
the
least
doubt
that
peter
was
somewhere
about
after
a
while
he
ran
over
to
a
hole
between
the
stones
of
the
old
wall
and
pretended
to
be
very
busy
there
just
as
if
it
really
were
the
new
house
he
had
found
he
kept
popping
in
and
out
and
looking
around
as
if
afraid
that
some
one
was
watching
him
he
even
got
some
dry
leaves
and
took
them
inside
as
if
to
make
a
bed
all
the
time
although
he
seen
a
sign
of
peter
he
did
have
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
peter
was
watching
him
when
he
grew
tired
a
new
idea
popped
into
his
shrewd
little
head
he
popped
out
of
the
hole
and
sat
up
on
the
wall
then
he
said
aloud
that
verse
which
had
made
peter
ears
burn
so
he
had
meant
to
make
peter
ears
burn
he
said
that
verse
just
as
if
he
really
did
believe
that
peter
was
not
spying
on
him
and
was
glad
of
it
when
he
had
finished
he
whisked
out
of
sight
again
to
give
peter
a
chance
to
get
away
but
this
time
chatterer
did
some
peeking
himself
he
hid
where
peter
could
see
him
but
where
he
himself
could
see
both
ways
along
the
old
stone
wall
and
so
it
was
that
he
saw
peter
crawl
out
from
under
the
little
bush
where
he
had
been
hiding
and
sneak
away
in
the
direction
of
the
old
and
he
knew
that
this
time
peter
had
gone
for
good
then
chatterer
laughed
and
laughed
to
think
how
he
had
fooled
peter
rabbit
and
wished
that
he
could
pat
himself
on
the
back
for
being
so
smart
he
did
once
think
of
how
dishonest
and
mean
it
was
of
peter
to
spy
on
him
because
you
see
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
himself
one
has
to
have
one
wits
very
sharp
these
days
to
keep
a
secret
chuckled
chatterer
but
over
in
the
old
that
afternoon
peter
rabbit
sat
very
thoughtful
and
very
much
ashamed
the
thought
that
he
had
found
out
where
chatterer
new
house
was
did
give
him
the
pleasure
that
he
had
thought
it
would
his
ears
still
burned
for
he
thought
that
chatterer
supposed
him
honest
when
he
was
i
believe
i
go
over
and
tell
chatterer
all
about
it
and
how
mean
i
have
been
said
he
at
last
and
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
he
felt
better
and
all
the
time
he
had
found
chatterer
new
house
at
all
you
see
it
was
the
old
home
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
in
an
old
which
chatterer
had
decided
to
live
in
viii
chatterer
grows
careless
when
you
grow
careless
even
though
it
be
in
matters
small
old
trouble
you
will
find
is
bound
to
make
a
call
some
people
never
seem
to
learn
that
you
would
suppose
that
after
all
the
trouble
and
worry
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
had
had
he
would
have
learned
a
lesson
for
a
while
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
morning
after
morning
before
anybody
was
up
in
farmer
brown
house
he
visited
farmer
brown
taking
the
greatest
care
not
to
be
seen
and
to
get
back
to
his
home
in
the
old
orchard
before
it
was
time
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
come
out
and
do
his
morning
work
and
in
the
he
took
the
greatest
care
to
steal
only
where
what
he
took
would
not
be
missed
the
empty
cobs
from
which
he
had
eaten
the
corn
he
hid
in
the
darkest
corner
behind
the
great
pile
of
yellow
corn
where
they
would
not
be
found
until
nearly
all
the
corn
had
been
taken
from
the
crib
oh
he
was
very
sly
and
crafty
was
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
at
first
but
after
a
while
when
nothing
happened
chatterer
grew
careless
at
first
it
had
seemed
very
dangerous
to
go
over
to
the
but
after
he
had
been
there
often
it
did
seem
dangerous
at
all
once
inside
he
would
just
give
himself
up
to
having
a
good
time
he
raced
about
over
the
great
pile
of
beautiful
yellow
corn
and
found
the
loveliest
hiding
places
in
it
down
in
a
dark
corner
he
made
a
splendid
bed
from
pieces
of
husk
which
had
been
stripped
from
some
of
the
ears
it
was
quite
the
nicest
place
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
was
farmer
brown
he
got
to
feeling
that
it
was
his
own
and
not
farmer
brown
at
all
the
more
that
feeling
grew
the
more
careless
chatterer
became
he
dropped
a
grain
of
corn
now
and
then
and
was
too
lazy
to
go
down
and
pick
it
up
or
else
did
think
anything
about
it
farmer
brown
boy
coming
every
morning
for
corn
for
the
hens
noticed
these
grains
but
supposed
they
were
some
that
had
been
rubbed
from
the
ears
during
the
handling
of
them
then
one
morning
chatterer
dropped
a
cob
from
which
he
had
eaten
all
the
corn
he
meant
to
get
it
and
hide
it
as
he
had
hidden
other
cobs
but
he
did
want
to
do
it
just
then
and
later
well
then
he
forgot
all
about
it
yes
sir
he
forgot
all
about
it
until
he
had
reached
his
home
in
the
old
orchard
oh
well
thought
chatterer
it
does
matter
i
can
get
it
and
hide
it
morning
now
a
is
a
very
simple
thing
farmer
brown
boy
knew
where
there
was
a
whole
pile
of
them
he
added
to
that
pile
every
day
after
shelling
enough
corn
for
the
biddies
so
it
would
seem
that
there
was
nothing
about
a
to
make
him
open
his
eyes
as
he
did
that
morning
when
he
saw
the
one
left
by
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
but
you
see
he
knew
that
a
bare
had
no
business
inside
the
and
suddenly
those
scattered
grains
of
corn
had
a
new
meaning
for
him
ha
ha
he
exclaimed
a
thief
has
been
here
after
all
i
thought
we
were
safe
from
rats
and
mice
and
i
do
see
now
how
they
got
in
for
i
do
i
really
do
see
how
they
could
climb
the
stone
legs
of
the
but
some
one
with
sharp
teeth
certainly
has
been
in
here
it
must
be
that
i
have
left
the
door
open
some
time
and
a
rat
has
slipped
in
i
just
have
to
get
after
you
rat
or
mr
mouse
we
ca
have
you
in
our
with
that
he
went
into
the
house
presently
he
came
back
and
in
one
hand
was
a
and
in
the
other
a
ix
chatterer
grows
too
curious
everybody
knows
how
curious
peter
rabbit
is
he
is
forever
poking
his
wobbly
little
nose
in
where
it
has
no
business
to
be
and
as
a
result
peter
is
forever
getting
into
trouble
whenever
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
has
heard
a
new
story
about
peter
and
the
scrapes
his
curiosity
has
got
him
into
chatterer
has
said
that
peter
got
no
more
than
he
deserved
as
for
himself
he
might
be
curious
about
a
thing
he
saw
for
the
first
time
but
he
had
too
much
sense
to
meddle
with
it
until
he
knew
all
about
it
so
chatterer
has
come
to
be
thought
very
smart
quite
too
smart
to
be
caught
in
a
trap
at
least
to
be
caught
in
an
ordinary
trap
now
a
great
many
people
manage
to
make
their
neighbors
think
they
are
a
great
deal
smarter
than
they
really
are
and
chatterer
is
one
of
this
kind
if
some
of
his
neighbors
could
have
peeped
into
farmer
the
morning
after
farmer
brown
boy
found
the
telltale
so
carelessly
dropped
by
chatterer
they
would
have
been
surprised
yes
sir
they
would
have
been
surprised
they
would
have
seen
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
the
boaster
he
of
the
sharp
wits
showing
quite
as
much
curiosity
as
ever
possessed
peter
rabbit
chatterer
had
come
over
to
the
as
usual
to
get
his
daily
supply
of
corn
as
usual
he
had
raced
about
over
the
great
pile
of
yellow
corn
quite
suddenly
his
sharp
eyes
spied
something
that
they
had
seen
before
it
was
down
on
the
floor
of
the
quite
near
the
door
chatterer
was
sure
that
it
had
been
there
the
day
before
it
was
a
very
queer
looking
thing
very
queer
indeed
and
then
he
spied
another
queer
looking
thing
near
it
only
this
was
very
much
smaller
what
could
they
be
he
looked
at
them
suspiciously
they
looked
harmless
enough
they
did
move
he
ran
a
few
steps
towards
them
and
scolded
just
as
he
scolds
at
anything
new
he
finds
out
of
doors
still
they
did
move
he
ran
around
on
a
little
ledge
where
he
could
look
right
down
on
the
queer
things
he
was
sure
now
that
they
were
not
alive
the
biggest
one
he
could
see
all
through
inside
was
something
to
eat
the
littlest
thing
was
round
and
flat
with
funny
bits
of
wire
on
top
it
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
wood
and
in
the
sides
were
little
round
holes
too
small
for
him
to
put
his
head
through
leave
them
alone
said
a
small
voice
inside
of
chatterer
but
i
want
to
see
what
they
are
and
find
out
all
about
them
said
chatterer
no
good
ever
comes
of
meddling
with
things
you
do
know
about
said
the
small
voice
but
they
are
such
queer
looking
things
and
they
not
alive
they
ca
hurt
me
said
chatterer
nevertheless
he
ran
back
to
the
pile
of
corn
and
tried
to
eat
somehow
he
had
lost
his
appetite
he
could
take
his
eyes
off
those
two
queer
things
down
on
the
floor
better
keep
away
warned
the
small
voice
inside
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
have
a
closer
look
at
them
said
chatterer
so
once
more
he
scrambled
down
from
the
pile
of
corn
and
little
by
little
drew
nearer
to
the
two
queer
things
the
nearer
he
got
the
more
harmless
they
looked
finally
he
reached
out
and
smelled
of
the
smallest
then
he
turned
up
his
nose
smells
of
mice
muttered
chatterer
just
common
barn
mice
then
he
reached
out
a
paw
and
touched
it
pooh
said
he
it
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
just
then
he
touched
one
of
the
little
wires
and
there
was
a
sudden
snap
it
frightened
chatterer
so
that
he
scurried
away
but
he
could
stay
away
that
snap
was
such
a
funny
thing
and
it
had
done
any
harm
you
see
he
had
put
his
paw
in
at
one
of
the
little
holes
or
it
might
have
done
some
harm
pretty
soon
he
was
back
again
meddling
with
those
little
wires
on
top
every
once
in
a
while
there
would
be
a
snap
and
he
would
scamper
away
it
was
very
scary
and
great
fun
by
and
by
the
thing
would
snap
any
more
and
then
chatterer
grew
tired
of
his
queer
plaything
and
began
to
wonder
about
the
other
queer
thing
no
harm
had
come
from
the
first
one
and
so
he
was
sure
no
harm
could
come
from
the
other
x
old
trouble
gets
chatterer
at
last
of
course
you
have
guessed
what
it
was
that
chatterer
had
been
meddling
with
it
was
a
and
he
had
sprung
it
without
getting
hurt
chatterer
did
know
that
it
was
a
trap
he
ought
to
have
known
but
he
did
you
see
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
traps
farmer
brown
boy
had
sometimes
set
for
him
in
the
green
forest
he
knew
all
about
those
traps
and
never
never
went
near
them
now
that
there
was
nothing
more
exciting
about
the
chatterer
turned
his
attention
to
the
other
queer
thing
he
walked
all
around
it
and
looked
at
it
from
every
side
it
certainly
was
queer
yes
sir
it
certainly
was
queer
it
looked
something
like
a
little
house
only
he
could
see
all
through
it
he
put
one
paw
out
and
touched
it
nothing
happened
he
tried
it
again
then
he
jumped
right
on
top
of
it
still
nothing
happened
he
tried
his
sharp
teeth
on
it
but
he
could
bite
it
you
see
it
was
made
of
stout
wire
inside
was
something
that
looked
good
to
eat
it
smelled
good
too
chatterer
began
to
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
the
more
he
wondered
the
more
he
wanted
to
know
there
must
be
some
way
of
getting
in
and
if
he
could
get
in
of
course
he
could
get
out
again
he
jumped
down
to
the
floor
and
ran
all
around
the
queer
little
wire
house
at
each
end
was
a
sort
of
little
wire
hallway
chatterer
stuck
his
head
in
one
it
seemed
perfectly
safe
he
crept
a
little
way
in
and
then
backed
out
in
a
hurry
nothing
happened
he
tried
it
again
still
nothing
happened
better
keep
away
said
a
small
voice
down
inside
of
him
pooh
who
afraid
said
chatterer
this
thing
ca
hurt
me
then
he
crept
a
little
farther
in
right
in
front
of
him
was
a
little
round
doorway
with
a
little
wire
door
chatterer
pushed
the
little
door
with
his
nose
and
it
opened
a
teeny
weeny
bit
he
drew
back
suspiciously
then
he
tried
it
again
and
this
time
pushed
the
little
door
a
little
farther
open
he
did
this
two
or
three
times
until
finally
he
had
his
head
quite
inside
and
there
right
down
below
him
was
that
food
he
so
wanted
to
taste
i
can
hop
right
down
and
get
it
and
then
hop
right
up
again
thought
chatterer
do
do
it
said
the
small
voice
inside
corn
is
plenty
good
enough
besides
it
is
time
you
were
getting
back
to
the
old
orchard
it
wo
take
but
a
minute
said
chatterer
and
i
really
must
know
what
that
tastes
like
with
that
he
jumped
down
snap
chatterer
looked
up
the
little
wire
door
had
closed
old
trouble
had
got
chatterer
at
last
yes
sir
he
certainly
had
got
chatterer
this
time
you
see
he
could
open
that
little
wire
door
from
the
inside
he
was
in
a
trap
the
wire
set
by
farmer
brown
boy
xi
what
happened
next
to
chatterer
were
you
ever
terribly
terribly
frightened
that
was
the
way
chatterer
felt
he
was
caught
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
his
sharp
teeth
were
of
no
use
at
all
on
those
hard
wires
he
could
look
out
between
them
but
he
could
get
out
he
was
too
frightened
to
think
his
heart
pounded
against
his
sides
until
it
hurt
he
forgot
all
about
that
queer
food
he
had
so
wanted
to
taste
and
which
was
right
before
him
now
indeed
he
felt
as
if
he
never
never
would
want
to
eat
again
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
now
what
would
farmer
brown
boy
do
to
him
when
he
found
him
there
hark
what
was
that
it
was
a
step
just
outside
the
door
of
the
farmer
brown
boy
was
coming
chatterer
raced
around
his
little
wire
prison
and
bit
savagely
at
the
hard
wires
but
it
was
of
no
use
no
use
at
all
it
only
hurt
his
mouth
cruelly
then
the
door
of
the
swung
open
a
flood
of
light
poured
in
and
with
it
came
farmer
brown
boy
hello
exclaimed
farmer
brown
boy
as
he
caught
sight
of
chatterer
so
you
are
the
thief
who
has
been
stealing
our
corn
and
i
thought
it
was
a
rat
or
a
mouse
well
well
you
little
red
rascal
did
you
know
that
thieves
come
to
no
good
end
you
pretty
smart
for
i
never
once
thought
of
you
but
you
were
not
so
smart
as
you
thought
now
i
wonder
what
we
had
better
do
with
you
he
picked
up
the
trap
with
chatterer
in
it
and
stepped
out
into
the
beautiful
great
chatterer
could
see
across
the
dooryard
to
the
old
orchard
and
the
familiar
old
stone
wall
along
which
he
had
scampered
so
often
they
looked
just
the
same
as
ever
and
yet
well
they
did
look
just
the
same
for
he
could
look
at
them
without
seeing
those
cruel
wires
which
were
keeping
him
from
them
farmer
brown
boy
put
the
trap
down
on
the
ground
and
then
began
to
call
puss
puss
puss
called
farmer
brown
boy
chatterer
heart
which
had
been
thumping
so
almost
stopped
beating
with
fright
there
was
black
pussy
whom
he
had
so
often
teased
and
made
fun
of
her
yellow
eyes
had
a
hungry
gleam
as
she
walked
around
the
trap
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
never
had
chatterer
heard
such
a
terrible
sound
as
those
hungry
sniffs
so
close
to
him
black
pussy
tried
to
put
a
paw
between
the
wires
and
chatterer
saw
the
great
cruel
claws
but
black
pussy
could
get
her
paw
between
the
wires
how
would
you
like
him
for
breakfast
asked
farmer
brown
boy
meow
said
black
pussy
arching
her
back
and
rubbing
against
his
legs
i
suppose
that
means
that
you
would
like
him
very
much
laughed
farmer
brown
boy
do
you
think
you
can
catch
him
if
i
let
him
out
meow
replied
black
pussy
again
and
to
poor
chatterer
it
seemed
the
awfullest
sound
he
ever
had
heard
well
we
see
about
it
by
and
by
said
farmer
brown
boy
the
breakfast
bell
and
i
have
fed
the
biddies
yet
xii
chatterer
is
sure
that
this
is
his
last
day
there
was
no
hope
not
the
teeniest
weeniest
ray
of
hope
in
the
heart
of
chatterer
as
farmer
brown
boy
picked
up
the
wire
and
started
for
the
house
black
pussy
the
cat
following
at
his
heels
and
looking
up
at
chatterer
with
cruel
hungry
eyes
chatterer
took
a
farewell
look
at
the
old
orchard
and
way
beyond
it
the
green
forest
from
which
he
had
been
driven
by
fear
of
shadow
the
weasel
then
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
closed
and
shut
it
all
out
if
there
had
been
any
hope
in
chatterer
heart
the
closing
of
that
door
would
have
shut
the
last
bit
out
but
there
was
any
hope
chatterer
was
sure
that
he
was
to
be
given
to
black
pussy
for
her
breakfast
farmer
brown
boy
put
the
trap
on
a
table
what
have
you
there
called
a
great
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
farmer
brown
himself
who
was
eating
his
breakfast
i
got
the
thief
who
has
been
stealing
our
corn
in
the
crib
replied
farmer
brown
boy
and
who
do
you
think
it
is
one
of
those
pesky
rats
replied
farmer
brown
i
afraid
you
been
careless
and
left
the
door
open
some
time
and
that
is
how
the
rats
have
got
in
there
but
it
is
a
rat
and
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
rat
there
replied
farmer
brown
boy
in
triumph
it
that
little
scamp
of
a
red
squirrel
we
seen
racing
along
the
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
lately
i
ca
imagine
how
he
got
in
there
but
there
he
was
and
now
here
he
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
asked
farmer
brown
coming
over
to
look
at
chatterer
i
do
know
replied
farmer
brown
boy
unless
i
give
him
to
black
puss
for
her
breakfast
she
has
been
teasing
me
for
him
ever
since
i
found
him
farmer
brown
boy
looked
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
as
he
said
this
and
his
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
oh
you
must
do
that
that
would
be
cruel
cried
a
soft
voice
you
must
take
him
down
to
the
green
forest
and
let
him
go
a
gentle
face
with
pitying
eyes
was
bent
above
the
trap
just
see
how
frightened
the
poor
little
thing
is
you
must
take
him
straight
down
to
the
green
forest
right
after
breakfast
is
that
just
like
mother
cried
farmer
brown
boy
i
believe
it
would
be
just
the
same
with
the
ugliest
old
rat
that
ever
lived
she
would
try
to
think
of
some
excuse
for
letting
it
go
god
made
all
the
little
people
who
wear
fur
and
they
must
have
some
place
in
his
great
plan
said
brown
farmer
brown
laughed
a
big
hearty
laugh
true
enough
mother
said
he
the
trouble
is
they
get
out
of
place
now
this
little
place
is
down
in
the
green
forest
and
not
up
in
our
then
put
him
back
in
his
right
place
was
the
prompt
reply
and
they
all
laughed
now
all
this
time
poor
chatterer
was
thinking
that
this
surely
was
his
last
day
you
see
he
knew
that
he
had
been
a
thief
and
he
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
knew
it
he
just
crouched
down
in
a
little
ball
too
miserable
to
do
anything
but
tremble
every
time
any
one
came
near
he
was
sure
that
he
had
seen
for
the
last
time
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
and
jolly
sun
and
all
the
other
beautiful
things
he
loved
so
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
with
despair
xiii
chatterer
is
put
in
prison
who
ever
does
a
deed
that
wrong
will
surely
find
some
day
that
for
that
naughty
act
of
his
he
surely
have
to
pay
that
was
the
way
with
chatterer
of
course
he
had
had
no
business
to
steal
corn
from
farmer
brown
to
be
sure
he
had
felt
that
he
had
just
as
much
right
to
that
corn
as
farmer
brown
had
you
see
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
feel
that
everything
that
grows
belongs
to
them
if
they
want
it
and
are
smart
enough
to
get
it
before
some
one
else
does
but
it
is
just
there
that
chatterer
went
wrong
farmer
brown
had
harvested
that
corn
and
stored
it
in
his
and
so
of
course
no
one
else
had
any
right
to
it
right
down
deep
in
his
heart
chatterer
knew
this
if
he
had
known
it
he
would
have
been
so
sly
in
taking
what
he
wanted
he
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
stealing
but
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
it
was
all
right
so
he
had
kept
on
stealing
and
stealing
until
at
last
he
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
now
he
had
got
to
pay
for
his
chatterer
was
very
miserable
so
miserable
and
frightened
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
sit
huddled
up
in
a
little
shivery
ball
he
had
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
this
was
his
very
last
day
and
that
farmer
brown
boy
would
turn
him
over
to
cruel
black
pussy
for
her
breakfast
farmer
brown
boy
had
left
him
in
the
trap
in
the
house
and
had
gone
out
for
a
long
time
chatterer
could
hear
pounding
out
in
the
woodshed
and
farmer
brown
boy
was
whistling
as
he
pounded
chatterer
wondered
how
he
could
whistle
and
seem
so
happy
when
he
meant
to
do
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
to
give
him
to
black
pussy
after
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
ages
and
ages
farmer
brown
boy
came
back
he
had
with
him
a
queer
looking
box
there
said
he
is
a
new
home
for
you
you
little
red
imp
i
guess
it
will
keep
you
out
of
trouble
for
a
while
he
slid
back
a
little
door
in
the
top
of
the
box
and
then
putting
on
a
stout
glove
and
opening
a
little
door
in
the
trap
he
put
in
his
big
hand
and
closed
it
around
chatterer
poor
little
chatterer
he
was
sure
now
that
this
was
the
end
and
that
he
was
to
be
given
to
black
pussy
who
was
looking
on
with
hungry
yellow
eyes
he
struggled
and
did
his
best
to
bite
but
the
thick
glove
gave
his
sharp
little
teeth
no
chance
to
hurt
the
hand
that
held
him
even
in
his
terror
he
noticed
that
that
big
hand
tried
to
be
gentle
and
squeezed
him
no
tighter
than
was
necessary
then
he
was
lifted
out
of
the
trap
and
dropped
through
the
little
doorway
in
the
top
of
the
queer
box
and
the
door
was
fastened
nothing
terrible
had
happened
after
all
at
first
chatterer
just
sulked
in
one
corner
he
still
felt
sure
that
something
terrible
was
going
to
happen
farmer
brown
boy
took
the
box
out
into
the
shed
and
put
it
where
the
sun
shone
into
it
for
a
little
while
he
stayed
watching
but
chatterer
still
sulked
and
sulked
by
and
by
he
went
away
taking
black
pussy
with
him
and
chatterer
was
alone
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
was
about
chatterer
began
to
wonder
what
sort
of
a
place
he
was
in
and
if
there
was
some
way
to
get
out
he
found
that
one
side
and
the
top
were
of
fine
stout
wire
through
which
he
could
look
out
and
that
the
other
sides
and
the
bottom
were
of
wood
covered
with
wire
so
that
there
was
no
chance
for
his
sharp
teeth
to
gnaw
a
way
out
in
one
corner
was
a
stout
piece
of
an
with
two
little
stubby
branches
to
sit
on
and
half
way
up
a
little
round
hole
very
cautiously
chatterer
peeped
inside
the
hole
inside
was
a
splendid
hollow
on
the
floor
of
the
box
was
a
little
heap
of
shavings
and
bits
of
rag
and
there
was
a
little
pile
of
yellow
corn
how
chatterer
did
hate
the
sight
of
that
corn
you
see
it
was
corn
that
had
got
him
into
all
this
trouble
at
least
that
is
the
way
chatterer
felt
about
it
when
he
had
examined
everything
he
knew
that
there
was
no
way
out
chatterer
was
in
a
prison
though
that
is
not
what
farmer
boy
called
it
he
said
it
was
a
cage
illustration
very
cautiously
chatterer
peeped
inside
the
hole
xiv
chatterer
decides
to
live
at
first
chatterer
decided
that
he
had
rather
die
than
live
in
a
prison
no
matter
how
nice
that
prison
might
be
it
was
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do
but
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
just
would
eat
he
would
touch
that
nice
yellow
corn
farmer
brown
boy
had
put
in
his
prison
for
him
he
would
starve
himself
to
death
yes
sir
he
would
starve
himself
to
death
so
when
he
found
that
there
was
no
way
to
get
out
of
his
prison
he
curled
up
in
the
little
hollow
stump
in
his
prison
where
no
one
could
see
him
and
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
stay
there
until
he
died
life
was
worth
living
if
he
had
got
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
his
days
in
a
prison
he
would
even
make
himself
comfortable
there
was
that
little
heap
of
nice
shavings
and
bits
of
rag
for
him
to
make
a
nice
comfortable
bed
of
but
he
did
touch
them
no
sir
he
just
tried
to
make
himself
miserable
not
once
that
long
day
did
he
poke
so
much
as
the
tip
of
his
nose
out
of
his
little
round
doorway
ever
so
many
times
farmer
brown
boy
came
to
see
him
and
whistled
and
called
softly
to
him
but
chatterer
make
a
sound
at
last
night
came
and
the
woodshed
where
his
prison
was
grew
dark
and
darker
and
very
still
now
it
was
about
this
time
that
chatterer
stomach
began
to
make
itself
felt
chatterer
tried
not
to
notice
it
but
his
stomach
would
be
noticed
and
chatterer
help
himself
his
stomach
was
empty
and
it
kept
telling
him
so
i
going
to
starve
to
death
said
chatterer
to
himself
over
and
over
i
empty
and
there
is
plenty
of
food
to
fill
me
up
if
you
only
stop
being
silly
whispered
his
stomach
the
more
chatterer
tried
not
to
think
of
how
good
something
to
eat
would
taste
the
more
he
did
think
of
it
it
made
him
restless
and
uneasy
he
twisted
and
squirmed
and
turned
at
last
he
decided
that
he
would
have
one
more
look
to
see
if
he
could
find
some
way
to
get
out
of
his
prison
he
poked
his
head
out
of
the
little
round
doorway
all
was
still
and
dark
he
listened
but
not
a
sound
could
he
hear
then
he
softly
crept
out
and
hurriedly
examined
all
the
inside
of
his
prison
once
more
it
was
of
no
use
there
was
a
single
place
where
he
could
use
his
sharp
teeth
there
that
little
pile
of
corn
waiting
for
me
whispered
his
stomach
i
never
touch
it
said
chatterer
fiercely
just
then
he
hit
something
with
his
foot
and
it
rolled
he
picked
it
up
and
then
put
it
down
again
it
was
a
nut
a
plump
hickory
nut
two
or
three
times
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
down
and
each
time
it
was
harder
than
before
to
put
it
down
i
i
i
like
to
taste
one
more
nut
before
i
starve
to
death
muttered
chatterer
and
almost
without
knowing
it
he
began
to
gnaw
the
hard
shell
when
that
nut
was
finished
he
found
another
and
when
that
was
gone
still
another
then
he
just
had
to
taste
a
grain
of
corn
the
first
thing
chatterer
knew
the
nuts
and
the
corn
were
all
gone
and
his
stomach
was
full
somehow
he
felt
ever
so
much
better
he
did
feel
like
starving
to
death
now
i
i
believe
i
wait
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
said
he
to
himself
and
while
i
waiting
i
may
as
well
be
comfortable
with
that
he
began
to
carry
the
shavings
and
rags
into
the
hollow
stump
and
soon
had
as
comfortable
a
bed
as
ever
he
had
slept
on
chatterer
had
decided
to
live
xv
farmer
brown
boy
tries
to
make
friends
nobody
lives
who
wholly
bad
some
good
you
find
in
every
heart
your
enemies
will
be
your
friends
if
only
you
will
do
your
part
all
his
life
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
had
looked
on
farmer
brown
boy
as
his
enemy
just
as
did
all
the
other
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
the
green
forest
and
the
smiling
pool
they
feared
him
and
because
they
feared
him
they
hated
him
so
whenever
he
came
near
they
ran
away
now
at
first
farmer
brown
boy
used
to
run
after
them
for
just
one
thing
because
he
wanted
to
make
friends
with
them
and
he
could
see
how
ever
he
was
going
to
do
it
unless
he
caught
them
after
a
while
when
he
found
that
he
could
catch
them
by
running
after
them
he
made
up
his
mind
that
they
did
want
to
be
his
friends
and
so
then
he
began
to
hunt
them
because
he
thought
it
was
fun
to
try
to
outwit
them
of
course
when
he
began
to
do
that
they
hated
him
and
feared
him
all
the
more
you
see
they
did
understand
that
really
he
had
one
of
the
kindest
hearts
in
the
world
and
he
did
understand
that
they
hated
him
just
because
they
did
know
him
so
when
chatterer
had
been
caught
in
the
trap
in
farmer
he
had
doubted
in
the
least
that
farmer
brown
boy
would
give
him
to
black
pussy
or
do
something
equally
cruel
and
even
when
he
found
that
he
was
only
to
be
kept
a
prisoner
in
a
very
comfortable
prison
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
he
was
willing
to
believe
any
good
of
farmer
brown
boy
indeed
he
hated
him
more
than
ever
if
that
were
possible
but
farmer
brown
boy
was
very
patient
he
came
to
chatterer
prison
ever
so
many
times
a
day
and
whistled
and
clucked
and
talked
to
chatterer
and
he
brought
good
things
to
eat
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
all
the
time
trying
to
think
of
some
new
treat
for
chatterer
he
never
came
without
bringing
something
at
first
chatterer
would
hide
in
his
hollow
stump
as
soon
as
he
saw
farmer
brown
boy
coming
and
would
so
much
as
peek
out
until
he
had
gone
away
when
he
was
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
he
would
come
out
again
and
always
he
found
some
delicious
fat
nuts
or
some
other
dainty
waiting
for
him
after
a
little
as
soon
as
he
saw
farmer
brown
boy
coming
chatterer
would
begin
to
wonder
what
good
thing
he
had
brought
this
time
and
would
grow
terribly
impatient
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
go
away
so
that
he
could
find
out
by
and
by
it
got
so
that
he
could
wait
but
would
slyly
peep
out
of
his
little
round
doorway
to
see
what
had
been
brought
for
him
then
one
day
farmer
brown
boy
did
come
at
all
chatterer
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
was
glad
he
told
himself
that
he
hated
farmer
brown
boy
and
he
hoped
that
he
never
never
would
see
him
again
but
all
the
time
he
knew
that
it
was
true
it
was
the
longest
day
since
chatterer
had
been
a
prisoner
early
the
next
morning
before
chatterer
was
out
of
bed
he
heard
a
step
in
the
woodshed
and
before
he
thought
what
he
was
doing
he
was
out
of
his
hollow
stump
to
see
if
it
really
was
farmer
brown
boy
it
was
and
he
had
three
great
fat
nuts
which
he
dropped
into
chatterer
cage
it
seemed
to
chatterer
that
he
just
could
wait
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
go
away
finally
he
darted
forward
and
seized
one
then
he
scampered
to
the
shelter
of
his
hollow
stump
to
eat
it
when
it
was
finished
he
just
had
to
have
another
farmer
brown
boy
was
still
watching
but
somehow
chatterer
did
feel
so
much
afraid
this
time
he
sat
up
on
one
of
the
little
branches
of
the
stump
and
ate
it
in
plain
sight
farmer
brown
boy
smiled
and
it
was
a
pleasant
smile
i
believe
we
shall
be
friends
after
all
said
he
xvi
chatterer
has
a
pleasant
surprise
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
the
mischief
maker
of
the
green
forest
had
never
been
more
comfortable
in
his
life
no
matter
how
rough
brother
north
wind
roared
across
the
green
meadows
and
through
the
green
forest
piling
the
snow
in
great
drifts
he
could
send
so
much
as
one
tiny
shiver
through
the
little
red
coat
of
chatterer
and
always
right
at
hand
was
plenty
to
eat
corn
and
nuts
and
other
good
things
such
as
chatterer
loves
no
he
never
had
been
so
comfortable
in
all
his
life
but
he
was
happy
not
truly
happy
you
see
he
was
in
prison
and
no
matter
how
nice
a
prison
may
be
no
one
can
be
truly
happy
there
since
he
had
been
a
prisoner
chatterer
had
learned
to
think
very
differently
of
farmer
brown
boy
from
what
he
used
to
think
in
fact
he
and
farmer
brown
boy
had
become
very
good
friends
for
farmer
brown
boy
was
always
very
gentle
and
always
brought
him
something
good
to
eat
he
is
at
all
like
what
i
had
thought
said
chatterer
and
if
i
were
free
i
would
be
afraid
of
him
at
all
i
i
like
to
tell
some
of
the
other
little
green
forest
people
about
him
if
only
chatterer
did
finish
instead
a
great
lump
filled
his
throat
you
see
he
was
thinking
of
the
green
forest
and
the
old
orchard
and
how
he
used
to
race
through
the
and
along
the
stone
wall
half
the
fun
in
life
had
been
in
running
and
jumping
and
now
there
was
room
in
this
little
prison
to
stretch
his
legs
if
only
he
could
run
run
as
hard
as
ever
he
knew
how
once
in
a
while
he
felt
that
his
prison
would
be
quite
so
hard
to
put
up
with
that
very
afternoon
while
chatterer
was
taking
a
nap
in
his
bed
in
the
hollow
stump
something
was
slipped
over
his
little
round
doorway
and
chatterer
awoke
in
a
terrible
fright
to
find
himself
a
prisoner
inside
his
hollow
stump
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
but
just
lie
there
in
his
bed
and
shake
with
fright
and
wonder
what
dreadful
thing
was
going
to
happen
next
he
could
hear
farmer
brown
boy
very
busy
about
something
in
his
cage
after
a
long
long
time
his
little
round
doorway
let
in
the
light
once
more
the
door
had
been
opened
at
first
chatterer
did
dare
go
out
but
he
heard
the
soft
little
whistle
with
which
farmer
brown
boy
always
called
him
when
he
had
something
especially
nice
for
him
to
eat
so
at
last
he
peeped
out
there
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
were
some
of
the
nicest
nuts
chatterer
came
out
at
once
then
his
sharp
eyes
discovered
something
else
it
was
a
queer
looking
thing
made
of
wire
at
one
end
of
his
cage
chatterer
looked
at
it
with
great
suspicion
could
it
be
a
new
kind
of
trap
but
what
would
a
trap
be
doing
there
when
he
was
already
a
prisoner
he
ate
all
the
nuts
all
the
time
watching
this
new
queer
looking
thing
it
seemed
harmless
enough
he
went
a
little
nearer
finally
he
hopped
into
it
it
moved
of
course
that
frightened
him
and
he
started
to
run
up
but
he
did
go
up
no
sir
he
did
go
up
you
see
he
was
in
a
wire
wheel
and
as
he
ran
the
wheel
went
around
chatterer
was
terribly
frightened
and
the
faster
he
tried
to
run
the
faster
the
wheel
went
around
finally
he
had
to
stop
because
he
was
out
of
breath
and
too
tired
to
run
another
step
when
he
stopped
the
wheel
stopped
little
by
little
chatterer
began
to
understand
farmer
brown
boy
had
made
that
wheel
to
give
him
a
chance
to
run
all
he
wanted
to
and
whenever
he
wanted
to
when
he
understood
this
chatterer
was
as
nearly
happy
as
he
could
be
in
a
prison
it
was
such
a
pleasant
surprise
he
would
race
and
race
in
it
until
he
just
had
to
stop
for
breath
farmer
brown
boy
looked
on
and
laughed
to
see
how
much
happier
he
had
made
chatterer
xvii
sammy
jay
sharp
eyes
everybody
knows
that
sammy
jay
has
sharp
eyes
in
fact
there
are
very
few
of
the
little
forest
people
whose
eyes
are
as
sharp
as
sammy
that
is
because
he
uses
them
so
much
a
long
time
ago
he
found
out
that
the
more
he
used
his
eyes
the
sharper
they
became
and
so
there
are
very
few
minutes
when
sammy
is
awake
that
he
is
trying
to
see
something
he
is
always
looking
that
is
the
reason
he
always
knows
so
much
about
what
is
going
on
in
the
green
forest
and
on
the
green
meadows
now
of
course
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
could
disappear
without
being
missed
particularly
by
sammy
jay
and
of
course
sammy
miss
chatterer
and
not
wonder
what
had
become
of
him
at
first
sammy
thought
that
chatterer
was
hiding
but
after
peeking
and
peering
and
watching
in
the
old
orchard
for
a
few
days
he
was
forced
to
think
that
either
chatterer
had
once
more
moved
or
else
that
something
had
happened
to
him
perhaps
shadow
the
weasel
has
caught
him
after
all
thought
sammy
and
straightway
flew
to
a
certain
place
in
the
green
forest
where
he
might
find
shadow
the
weasel
sure
enough
shadow
was
there
now
of
course
it
would
do
to
ask
right
out
if
shadow
had
caught
chatterer
and
sammy
was
smart
enough
to
know
it
illustration
you
tell
chatterer
that
i
get
him
yet
snarled
shadow
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
sends
his
respects
and
hopes
you
are
enjoying
your
hunt
for
him
called
sammy
shadow
looked
up
at
sammy
and
anger
blazed
in
his
little
red
eyes
you
tell
chatterer
that
i
get
him
yet
snarled
shadow
sammy
eyes
sparkled
with
mischief
he
had
made
shadow
angry
and
he
had
found
out
what
he
wanted
to
know
he
was
sure
that
shadow
had
not
caught
chatterer
but
what
can
have
become
of
him
thought
sammy
i
got
no
love
for
him
but
just
the
same
i
miss
him
i
really
must
find
out
yes
sir
i
really
must
so
every
minute
that
he
could
spare
sammy
jay
spent
trying
to
find
chatterer
he
asked
every
one
he
met
if
they
had
seen
chatterer
he
peeked
and
peered
into
every
hollow
and
hiding
place
he
could
think
of
but
look
as
he
would
and
ask
as
he
would
he
could
find
no
trace
of
chatterer
at
last
he
happened
to
think
of
farmer
brown
could
it
be
that
chatterer
had
moved
over
there
or
had
come
to
some
dreadful
end
there
very
early
the
next
morning
sammy
flew
over
to
the
he
looked
it
all
over
with
his
sharp
eyes
and
listened
for
sounds
of
chatterer
inside
but
not
a
sound
could
he
hear
then
he
remembered
the
hole
under
the
edge
of
the
roof
through
which
chatterer
used
to
go
in
and
out
sammy
hurried
to
look
at
it
it
was
closed
by
a
stout
board
nailed
across
it
then
sammy
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
found
it
he
killed
chatterer
that
what
he
done
cried
sammy
and
flew
over
to
the
old
orchard
filled
with
sad
thoughts
he
meant
to
wait
until
farmer
brown
boy
came
out
and
then
tell
him
what
he
thought
of
him
after
that
he
would
fly
through
the
green
forest
and
over
the
green
meadows
to
spread
the
sad
news
after
a
while
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
opened
and
farmer
brown
boy
stepped
out
sammy
had
his
mouth
open
to
scream
when
his
sharp
eyes
saw
something
queer
farmer
brown
boy
had
a
queer
looking
box
in
his
arms
which
he
put
on
a
shelf
where
the
sun
would
shine
on
it
it
looked
to
sammy
as
if
something
moved
inside
that
box
he
forgot
to
scream
and
say
the
bad
things
he
had
planned
to
say
he
waited
until
farmer
brown
boy
had
gone
to
the
barn
then
sammy
flew
where
he
could
look
right
into
the
queer
box
there
was
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
xviii
chatterer
is
made
fun
of
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
smarty
caught
at
last
sammy
jay
fairly
shrieked
with
glee
as
he
peered
down
from
the
top
of
an
at
chatterer
in
the
cage
farmer
brown
boy
had
made
for
him
sammy
was
so
relieved
to
think
that
chatterer
was
not
dead
and
he
was
so
tickled
to
think
that
chatterer
who
always
thought
himself
so
smart
should
have
been
caught
that
he
just
had
to
torment
chatterer
by
laughing
at
him
and
saying
mean
things
to
him
until
chatterer
lost
his
temper
and
said
things
back
quite
in
the
old
way
this
tickled
sammy
more
than
ever
for
it
sounded
so
exactly
like
chatterer
when
he
had
been
a
free
little
imp
of
mischief
in
the
green
forest
that
sammy
felt
sure
that
chatterer
had
nothing
the
matter
with
him
but
he
could
stop
very
long
to
make
fun
of
poor
chatterer
in
the
first
place
farmer
brown
boy
had
put
his
head
out
the
barn
door
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
in
the
second
place
sammy
fairly
ached
all
over
to
spread
the
news
through
the
green
forest
and
over
the
green
meadows
you
know
he
is
a
great
gossip
and
this
was
such
unusual
news
sammy
knew
very
well
that
no
one
would
believe
him
he
knew
that
they
just
could
believe
that
smart
chatterer
had
really
been
caught
and
no
one
did
believe
it
all
right
sammy
would
reply
it
does
make
the
least
bit
of
difference
in
the
world
to
me
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
you
can
go
up
to
farmer
brown
house
and
see
him
in
prison
yourself
just
as
i
did
so
late
that
afternoon
when
all
was
quiet
around
the
farmyard
chatterer
saw
something
very
familiar
behind
the
old
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
it
bobbed
up
and
then
dropped
out
of
sight
again
then
it
bobbed
up
again
only
to
drop
out
of
sight
just
as
quickly
it
looks
to
me
very
much
as
if
peter
rabbit
is
over
there
and
feeling
very
nervous
said
chatterer
to
himself
and
then
he
called
sharply
just
as
when
he
was
free
in
the
green
forest
right
away
peter
head
bobbed
up
for
all
the
world
like
a
and
this
time
it
stayed
up
peter
eyes
were
round
with
surprise
as
he
stared
across
at
chatterer
prison
oh
it
true
gasped
peter
as
if
it
were
as
hard
work
to
believe
his
own
eyes
as
it
was
to
believe
sammy
jay
i
must
go
right
away
and
see
what
can
be
done
to
get
chatterer
out
of
trouble
and
then
because
it
was
broad
daylight
and
he
really
did
dare
stay
another
minute
peter
waved
to
chatterer
and
started
for
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
a
little
later
who
should
appear
peeping
over
the
stone
wall
but
reddy
fox
it
seemed
very
bold
of
reddy
but
really
it
was
nearly
as
bold
as
it
seemed
you
see
reddy
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
were
over
in
the
old
pasture
and
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
he
grinned
at
chatterer
in
the
most
provoking
way
it
made
chatterer
angry
just
to
see
him
smarty
smarty
smarty
glad
to
see
you
looking
hearty
weather
fine
as
you
can
see
wo
you
take
a
walk
with
me
so
said
reddy
fox
knowing
all
the
time
that
chatterer
could
take
a
walk
with
any
one
at
first
chatterer
scolded
and
called
reddy
all
the
bad
names
he
could
think
of
but
after
a
little
he
did
feel
so
much
like
scolding
in
fact
he
did
half
hear
the
mean
things
reddy
fox
said
to
him
you
see
it
was
coming
over
him
more
and
more
that
nothing
could
take
the
place
of
freedom
he
had
a
comfortable
home
plenty
to
eat
and
was
safe
from
every
harm
but
he
was
a
prisoner
and
having
these
visitors
made
him
realize
it
more
than
ever
something
very
like
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
he
crept
into
his
hollow
stump
where
he
could
see
or
be
seen
xix
peter
rabbit
tries
to
help
peter
rabbit
is
one
of
the
kindest
hearted
little
people
of
the
green
forest
or
the
green
meadows
he
is
and
his
dreadful
curiosity
is
forever
getting
him
into
all
kinds
of
trouble
perhaps
it
is
because
he
has
been
in
so
many
scrapes
himself
that
he
always
feels
sorry
for
others
who
get
into
trouble
anyway
no
sooner
does
peter
hear
of
some
one
in
trouble
than
he
begins
to
wonder
how
he
can
help
them
so
just
as
soon
as
he
found
out
for
himself
that
sammy
jay
had
told
the
truth
about
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
and
that
chatterer
really
was
in
a
prison
at
farmer
brown
house
he
began
to
think
and
think
to
find
some
way
to
help
chatterer
now
of
course
peter
did
know
what
kind
of
a
prison
chatterer
was
in
he
remembered
right
away
how
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
had
gnawed
a
great
hole
in
the
box
in
which
johnny
chuck
lost
baby
was
kept
by
farmer
brown
boy
why
should
prickly
porky
do
as
much
for
chatterer
he
would
go
see
him
at
once
the
trouble
with
peter
is
that
he
does
think
of
all
sides
of
a
question
he
is
impulsive
that
is
he
goes
right
ahead
and
does
the
thing
that
comes
into
his
head
first
and
sometimes
this
is
the
wisest
or
best
thing
to
do
so
now
he
scampered
down
into
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
to
hunt
for
prickly
porky
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
to
find
him
for
he
had
only
to
follow
the
line
of
trees
that
had
been
stripped
of
their
bark
good
afternoon
prickly
porky
have
you
heard
the
news
about
chatterer
said
peter
talking
very
fast
for
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
yes
replied
prickly
porky
serves
him
right
i
hope
it
will
teach
him
a
lesson
peter
heart
sank
do
you
think
it
is
dreadful
he
asked
just
think
he
will
never
never
be
able
to
run
and
play
in
the
green
forest
again
unless
we
can
get
him
out
so
much
the
better
grunted
prickly
porky
so
much
the
better
he
always
was
a
nuisance
never
did
see
such
a
fellow
for
making
trouble
for
other
people
no
sir
i
never
did
the
rest
of
us
can
have
some
peace
now
serves
him
right
prickly
porky
went
on
chewing
bark
as
if
chatterer
trouble
was
no
concern
of
his
peter
heart
sank
lower
still
he
scratched
one
long
ear
slowly
with
a
long
hind
foot
which
is
a
way
he
has
when
he
is
thinking
very
hard
he
was
so
busy
thinking
that
he
did
see
the
twinkle
in
the
dull
little
eyes
of
prickly
porky
who
really
was
not
so
as
his
words
sounded
after
a
long
time
during
which
peter
thought
and
thought
and
prickly
porky
ate
and
ate
the
latter
spoke
again
what
have
you
got
on
your
mind
peter
he
asked
i
i
was
just
thinking
how
perfectly
splendid
it
would
be
if
you
would
go
up
there
and
gnaw
a
way
out
of
his
prison
for
chatterer
replied
peter
timidly
huh
grunted
prickly
porky
huh
some
folks
think
my
wits
are
pretty
slow
but
even
i
know
better
than
that
put
on
your
thinking
cap
again
peter
rabbit
why
ca
you
you
are
not
afraid
of
bowser
the
hound
or
farmer
boy
and
everybody
else
is
excepting
jimmy
skunk
persisted
peter
for
the
very
good
reason
that
if
i
could
gnaw
into
his
prison
chatterer
could
gnaw
out
if
he
ca
gnaw
his
way
out
with
those
sharp
teeth
of
his
i
certainly
ca
gnaw
in
where
your
common
sense
peter
rabbit
that
so
i
had
thought
of
that
replied
peter
slowly
and
sorrowfully
i
must
try
to
think
of
some
other
way
to
help
chatterer
i
be
willing
to
try
if
it
was
of
any
use
but
it
is
said
prickly
porky
who
did
want
peter
to
think
that
he
really
was
as
as
he
had
seemed
at
first
illustration
i
be
willing
to
try
it
if
it
was
of
any
use
but
it
is
said
prickly
porky
so
peter
bade
prickly
porky
and
started
for
the
dear
old
to
try
to
think
of
some
other
way
to
help
chatterer
on
the
way
he
waked
up
unc
billy
possum
and
bobby
coon
but
they
could
give
him
any
help
there
really
does
seem
to
be
any
way
i
can
help
sighed
peter
and
there
really
was
xx
chatterer
has
another
great
surprise
chatterer
had
never
had
so
many
surprises
good
surprises
in
all
his
life
as
since
the
day
he
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
in
farmer
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
a
great
surprise
to
him
that
he
had
not
been
given
to
black
pussy
as
he
had
fully
expected
to
be
then
had
come
the
even
greater
surprise
of
finding
that
farmer
boy
was
ever
and
ever
so
much
nicer
than
he
had
thought
a
later
surprise
had
been
the
wire
wheel
in
his
cage
so
that
he
could
run
to
his
heart
content
it
was
such
a
pleasant
and
wholly
unexpected
surprise
that
it
had
quite
changed
chatterer
feelings
towards
farmer
brown
boy
the
fact
is
chatterer
could
have
been
truly
happy
but
for
one
thing
he
was
a
prisoner
yes
sir
he
was
a
prisoner
and
he
could
forget
it
for
one
minute
while
he
was
awake
he
used
to
watch
farmer
brown
boy
and
wish
with
all
his
might
that
he
could
make
him
understand
how
dreadful
it
was
to
be
in
a
prison
but
farmer
brown
boy
understand
what
chatterer
said
no
matter
how
hard
chatterer
tried
to
make
him
he
seemed
to
think
that
chatterer
was
happy
he
just
understand
that
not
all
the
good
things
in
the
world
could
make
up
for
loss
of
freedom
that
it
is
better
to
be
free
though
hungry
and
cold
than
in
a
prison
with
every
comfort
chatterer
had
stood
it
pretty
well
and
made
the
best
of
things
until
sammy
jay
had
found
him
and
reddy
fox
had
made
fun
of
him
and
peter
rabbit
had
peeped
at
him
from
behind
the
old
stone
wall
the
very
sight
of
them
going
where
they
pleased
and
when
they
pleased
had
been
too
much
for
chatterer
and
such
a
great
longing
for
the
green
forest
and
the
old
orchard
filled
his
heart
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
he
just
sat
in
a
corner
of
his
cage
and
looked
as
miserable
as
he
felt
he
lost
his
appetite
in
vain
farmer
brown
boy
brought
him
the
fattest
nuts
and
other
dainties
he
could
eat
for
the
great
longing
for
freedom
that
filled
his
heart
until
it
seemed
ready
to
burst
he
no
longer
cared
to
run
in
the
new
wire
wheel
which
had
given
him
so
much
pleasure
at
first
he
was
homesick
terribly
homesick
and
he
just
could
help
it
farmer
brown
boy
noticed
it
and
his
face
grew
sober
and
thoughtful
he
watched
chatterer
when
the
latter
did
know
that
he
was
about
and
if
he
could
understand
chatterer
talk
he
could
understand
chatterer
actions
he
knew
that
he
was
unhappy
and
guessed
why
one
morning
chatterer
did
not
come
out
of
his
hollow
stump
as
he
usually
did
when
his
cage
was
placed
on
the
shelf
outside
the
farmhouse
door
he
just
did
feel
like
it
he
stayed
curled
up
in
his
bed
for
a
long
long
time
too
sad
and
miserable
to
move
at
last
he
crawled
up
and
peeped
out
of
his
little
round
doorway
chatterer
gave
a
little
gasp
and
rubbed
his
eyes
was
he
dreaming
he
scrambled
out
in
a
hurry
and
peeped
through
the
wires
of
his
cage
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
again
and
rushed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
cage
for
another
look
his
cage
was
on
the
usual
shelf
at
all
it
was
on
the
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
chatterer
was
so
excited
he
did
know
what
to
do
he
raced
around
the
cage
then
he
jumped
into
the
wire
wheel
and
made
it
spin
round
and
round
as
never
before
when
he
was
too
tired
to
run
any
more
he
jumped
out
and
right
then
he
discovered
something
he
had
noticed
before
the
little
door
in
the
top
of
his
cage
was
open
it
must
be
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
forgotten
to
close
it
when
he
put
in
breakfast
chatterer
forgot
that
he
was
tired
like
a
little
red
flash
he
was
outside
and
whisking
along
the
stone
wall
straight
for
his
home
in
the
old
orchard
chickaree
chickaree
chickaree
he
shouted
as
he
ran
xxi
chatterer
hears
the
small
voice
the
very
first
of
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
to
see
chatterer
after
he
had
safely
reached
the
old
orchard
was
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
it
just
happened
that
tommy
was
very
busy
in
the
very
in
which
was
the
old
home
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
when
chatterer
reached
it
you
know
chatterer
had
moved
into
it
for
the
winter
just
a
little
while
before
he
had
been
caught
in
the
by
farmer
brown
boy
yes
sir
tommy
was
very
busy
indeed
he
was
so
busy
that
sharp
as
his
bright
little
eyes
are
he
had
not
seen
chatterer
racing
along
the
old
stone
wall
it
was
until
he
heard
chatterer
claws
on
the
trunk
of
the
that
tommy
saw
him
at
all
then
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
lost
his
balance
and
almost
turned
a
somersault
in
the
air
before
he
caught
another
twig
you
see
he
knew
all
about
chatterer
and
how
he
had
been
kept
a
prisoner
by
farmer
brown
boy
why
is
this
really
you
chatterer
he
exclaimed
however
did
you
get
out
of
your
prison
i
glad
ever
and
ever
so
glad
that
you
got
away
chatterer
flirted
his
tail
in
the
saucy
way
he
has
and
his
eyes
twinkled
here
was
just
the
best
chance
ever
to
boast
and
brag
he
could
tell
tommy
tit
how
smart
he
had
been
smart
enough
to
get
away
from
farmer
brown
boy
tommy
tit
would
tell
the
other
little
people
and
then
everybody
would
think
him
just
as
smart
as
unc
billy
possum
and
you
know
unc
billy
really
was
smart
enough
to
get
away
from
farmer
brown
boy
after
being
caught
everybody
knew
that
he
had
been
a
prisoner
and
now
that
he
was
free
everybody
would
believe
whatever
he
told
them
about
how
he
got
away
was
there
ever
such
a
chance
to
make
his
friends
and
neighbors
say
what
a
smart
fellow
he
is
i
i
chatterer
stopped
then
he
began
again
you
see
it
was
this
way
i
i
somehow
chatterer
could
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say
it
seemed
as
if
tommy
tit
bright
merry
eyes
were
looking
right
into
his
head
and
heart
and
could
see
his
very
thoughts
of
course
they
could
the
truth
is
that
little
small
voice
inside
which
chatterer
had
so
often
refused
to
listen
to
when
he
was
tempted
to
do
wrong
was
talking
again
it
was
saying
for
shame
chatterer
for
shame
tell
the
truth
tell
the
truth
it
was
that
little
small
voice
that
made
chatterer
hesitate
and
stop
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
were
smart
enough
to
fool
farmer
boy
and
get
out
of
that
stout
little
prison
he
made
for
you
do
you
asked
tommy
tit
no
replied
chatterer
almost
before
he
thought
no
i
did
the
fact
is
tommy
tit
he
left
the
door
open
purposely
he
let
me
go
farmer
brown
boy
is
half
so
bad
as
some
people
think
dee
dee
dee
laughed
tommy
tit
i
been
telling
a
lot
of
you
fellows
that
for
a
long
time
but
none
of
you
would
believe
me
now
i
guess
you
know
it
why
i
not
the
least
bit
afraid
of
farmer
boy
not
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
if
all
the
little
forest
and
meadow
people
would
only
trust
him
instead
of
running
away
from
him
he
would
be
the
very
best
friend
we
have
perhaps
so
replied
chatterer
doubtfully
he
was
very
good
to
me
while
i
was
in
his
prison
and
and
i
not
so
very
much
afraid
of
him
now
just
the
same
i
do
mean
to
let
him
get
hands
on
me
again
pooh
said
tommy
tit
pooh
i
just
as
soon
eat
out
of
his
hand
that
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
when
you
are
flying
around
free
but
i
do
believe
you
dare
go
up
to
his
house
and
prove
it
retorted
chatterer
ca
now
replied
tommy
i
got
too
much
to
do
for
him
right
now
but
some
day
i
show
you
dee
dee
dee
chickadee
i
wasting
my
time
talking
when
there
is
such
a
lot
to
be
done
i
am
clearing
his
of
insect
eggs
ha
ha
ha
go
it
you
little
red
scamp
shouted
a
voice
behind
him
then
chatterer
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
not
left
the
little
door
open
by
mistake
but
had
given
him
his
freedom
and
right
then
he
knew
that
they
were
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
xxii
tommy
tit
makes
good
his
boast
dee
dee
dee
chickadee
see
me
see
me
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
kept
saying
this
over
and
over
as
he
flew
from
the
green
forest
up
through
the
old
orchard
on
his
way
to
farmer
brown
dooryard
and
his
voice
was
merry
in
fact
his
voice
was
the
merriest
cheeriest
sound
to
be
heard
that
bright
snapping
cold
morning
to
be
sure
there
were
other
voices
but
they
were
not
merry
nor
were
they
cheery
there
was
the
voice
of
sammy
jay
but
it
sounded
peevish
and
discontented
and
there
was
the
voice
of
blacky
the
crow
but
it
sounded
harsh
and
unpleasant
and
there
was
the
voice
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
but
chatterer
was
scolding
just
from
habit
and
his
voice
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
so
every
one
who
heard
tommy
tit
cheery
voice
that
cold
winter
morning
just
had
to
smile
yes
sir
they
just
had
to
smile
even
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
they
just
could
help
themselves
when
tommy
reached
the
stone
wall
that
separated
the
old
orchard
from
farmer
dooryard
his
sharp
eyes
were
not
long
in
finding
peter
rabbit
and
happy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
and
chatterer
hiding
in
the
old
wall
where
they
could
peep
out
and
see
all
that
happened
in
farmer
dooryard
looking
back
through
the
old
orchard
he
saw
what
looked
like
a
little
bit
of
the
blue
blue
sky
flitting
silently
from
tree
to
tree
it
was
sammy
jay
over
in
the
very
top
of
a
tall
a
long
way
off
was
a
spot
of
black
tommy
did
need
to
be
told
that
it
was
blacky
the
crow
who
did
dare
come
any
nearer
tommy
fairly
bubbled
over
with
joy
he
knew
what
it
all
meant
he
knew
that
peter
rabbit
and
happy
jack
and
chatterer
and
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
had
come
to
see
him
make
good
his
boast
to
chatterer
that
he
would
eat
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
that
not
one
of
them
really
believed
that
he
would
do
it
he
tickled
all
over
and
cut
up
all
sorts
of
capers
just
for
pure
joy
finally
he
flew
over
to
the
that
grows
close
by
farmer
brown
house
dee
dee
dee
chickadee
see
me
see
me
called
tommy
tit
and
his
voice
sounded
cheerier
than
ever
and
merrier
than
ever
then
the
door
of
farmer
brown
house
opened
and
out
stepped
farmer
brown
boy
and
looked
up
at
tommy
tit
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
gentle
and
good
to
see
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
from
them
came
the
softest
sweetest
whistle
and
it
sounded
like
peter
rabbit
pinched
himself
to
be
sure
that
he
was
awake
for
it
was
tommy
tit
own
love
note
and
if
peter
had
not
been
looking
straight
at
farmer
brown
boy
he
would
have
been
sure
that
it
was
tommy
himself
who
had
whistled
whistled
farmer
brown
boy
again
replied
tommy
tit
and
it
was
hard
to
say
which
whistle
was
the
softest
and
sweetest
whistled
farmer
brown
boy
once
more
and
held
out
his
hand
in
it
was
a
cracked
hickory
nut
dee
dee
dee
see
me
see
me
cried
tommy
tit
and
flitted
down
from
the
right
on
to
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
his
bright
little
eyes
twinkled
merrily
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
bit
of
nut
meat
peter
rabbit
looked
at
happy
jack
and
happy
jack
looked
at
chatterer
and
all
three
acted
as
if
they
could
believe
their
own
eyes
then
they
looked
back
at
farmer
brown
boy
and
there
on
his
head
sat
tommy
tit
dee
dee
dee
chickadee
see
me
see
me
called
tommy
tit
and
his
voice
was
merrier
than
ever
for
he
had
made
good
his
boast
xxiii
chatterer
grows
very
very
bold
i
not
afraid
i
am
afraid
i
not
afraid
i
am
afraid
i
not
afraid
chatterer
kept
saying
these
two
things
over
and
over
and
over
again
to
himself
you
see
he
really
was
afraid
and
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
was
afraid
he
thought
that
perhaps
if
he
said
ever
and
ever
so
many
times
that
he
was
afraid
he
might
actually
make
himself
believe
it
the
trouble
was
that
every
time
he
said
it
a
little
voice
a
little
truthful
voice
down
inside
seemed
to
speak
right
up
and
tell
him
that
he
was
afraid
poor
chatterer
it
hurt
his
pride
to
have
to
own
to
himself
that
he
was
as
brave
as
little
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
his
common
sense
told
him
that
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
be
tommy
tit
went
every
day
and
took
food
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
it
seemed
to
chatterer
and
to
happy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
and
to
peter
rabbit
and
to
sammy
jay
and
to
blacky
the
crow
all
of
whom
had
seen
him
do
it
as
if
it
were
the
very
bravest
thing
they
ever
had
seen
and
their
respect
for
tommy
tit
grew
wonderfully
but
tommy
tit
himself
did
think
it
brave
at
all
no
sir
tommy
knew
better
you
see
he
has
a
great
deal
of
common
sense
under
the
little
black
cap
he
wears
it
may
have
been
brave
of
me
to
do
it
the
first
time
thought
he
to
himself
when
the
others
told
him
how
brave
they
thought
him
but
it
is
brave
of
me
now
because
i
know
that
no
harm
is
going
to
come
to
me
from
farmer
brown
boy
there
is
any
bravery
about
it
and
it
might
be
just
the
same
way
with
chatterer
and
all
the
other
little
forest
and
meadow
people
if
only
they
would
think
so
and
give
farmer
brown
boy
half
a
chance
chatterer
was
beginning
to
have
some
such
thoughts
himself
as
he
tried
to
make
himself
think
that
he
was
afraid
he
heard
the
door
of
farmer
brown
house
slam
and
peeped
out
from
the
old
stone
wall
there
was
farmer
brown
boy
with
a
big
fat
hickory
nut
held
out
in
the
most
tempting
way
and
farmer
brown
boy
was
whistling
the
same
gentle
little
whistle
he
had
used
when
chatterer
was
his
prisoner
and
he
had
brought
good
things
for
chatterer
to
eat
of
course
chatterer
knew
perfectly
well
that
that
whistle
was
a
call
for
him
and
that
that
big
fat
hickory
nut
was
intended
for
him
almost
before
he
thought
he
had
left
the
old
stone
wall
and
was
half
way
over
to
farmer
brown
boy
then
he
stopped
short
it
seemed
as
if
that
little
voice
inside
had
fairly
shouted
in
his
ears
i
am
afraid
it
was
true
he
was
afraid
he
was
right
on
the
very
point
of
turning
to
scurry
back
to
the
old
stone
wall
when
he
heard
another
voice
this
time
it
was
a
voice
inside
no
indeed
it
was
a
voice
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
in
the
old
orchard
and
this
is
what
it
said
coward
coward
coward
it
was
sammy
jay
speaking
now
it
is
one
thing
to
tell
yourself
that
you
are
afraid
and
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
be
told
by
some
one
else
that
you
are
afraid
no
such
thing
no
such
thing
i
not
afraid
scolded
chatterer
and
then
to
prove
it
he
suddenly
raced
forward
snatched
the
fat
hickory
nut
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
was
back
in
the
old
stone
wall
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
was
the
most
surprised
chatterer
himself
farmer
brown
boy
or
sammy
jay
i
did
it
i
did
it
i
did
it
boasted
chatterer
you
do
dare
do
it
again
though
said
sammy
jay
in
the
most
provoking
and
unpleasant
way
i
do
too
snapped
chatterer
and
he
did
it
and
with
the
taking
of
that
second
fat
nut
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
the
very
last
bit
of
fear
of
him
left
chatterer
and
he
knew
that
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
had
been
right
all
the
time
when
he
insisted
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
farmer
brown
boy
why
thought
chatterer
if
i
would
have
let
him
he
would
have
been
my
friend
long
ago
and
so
he
would
have
and
this
is
all
about
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
for
now
sammy
jay
insists
that
it
is
his
turn
now
and
so
the
next
book
will
be
about
his
adventures
the
end
