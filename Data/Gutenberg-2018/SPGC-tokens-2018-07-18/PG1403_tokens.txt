that
which
was
lacking
to
pierrotin
s
happiness
railroads
in
a
future
not
far
distant
must
force
certain
industries
to
disappear
forever
and
modify
several
others
more
especially
those
relating
to
the
different
modes
of
transportation
in
use
around
paris
therefore
the
persons
and
things
which
are
the
elements
of
this
scene
will
soon
give
to
it
the
character
of
an
archaeological
work
our
nephews
ought
to
be
enchanted
to
learn
the
social
material
of
an
epoch
which
they
will
call
the
olden
the
picturesque
coucous
which
stood
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
encumbering
the
coucous
which
had
flourished
for
a
century
and
were
still
numerous
in
scarcely
exist
in
unless
on
the
occasion
of
some
attractive
suburban
solemnity
like
that
of
the
grandes
eaux
of
versailles
in
the
various
celebrated
places
called
the
environs
of
paris
did
not
all
possess
a
regular
service
nevertheless
the
touchards
father
and
son
had
acquired
a
monopoly
of
travel
and
transportation
to
all
the
populous
towns
within
a
radius
of
miles
and
their
enterprise
constituted
a
fine
establishment
in
the
rue
du
in
spite
of
their
rights
in
spite
too
of
their
efforts
their
capital
and
all
the
advantages
of
a
powerful
centralization
the
touchard
coaches
messageries
found
terrible
competition
in
the
coucous
for
all
points
with
a
circumference
of
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
the
passion
of
the
parisian
for
the
country
is
such
that
local
enterprise
could
successfully
compete
with
the
lesser
stage
company
petites
messageries
the
name
given
to
the
touchard
enterprise
to
distinguish
it
from
that
of
the
grandes
messageries
of
the
rue
montmartre
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
the
touchard
success
was
stimulating
speculators
for
every
small
locality
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
there
sprang
up
schemes
of
beautiful
rapid
and
commodious
vehicles
departing
and
arriving
in
paris
at
fixed
hours
which
produced
naturally
a
fierce
competition
beaten
on
the
long
distances
of
twelve
to
eighteen
miles
the
coucou
came
down
to
shorter
trips
and
so
lived
on
for
several
years
at
last
however
it
succumbed
to
omnibuses
which
demonstrated
the
possibility
of
carrying
eighteen
persons
in
a
vehicle
drawn
by
two
horses
the
coucous
if
by
chance
any
of
those
birds
of
ponderous
flight
still
linger
in
the
might
be
made
as
to
its
structure
and
arrangement
the
subject
of
learned
researches
comparable
to
those
of
cuvier
on
the
animals
discovered
in
the
chalk
pits
of
montmartre
these
petty
enterprises
which
had
struggled
since
against
the
touchards
usually
found
a
strong
foothold
in
the
and
sympathy
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
districts
which
they
served
the
person
undertaking
the
business
as
proprietor
and
conductor
was
nearly
always
an
along
the
route
to
whom
the
beings
things
and
interests
with
which
he
had
to
do
were
all
familiar
he
could
execute
commissions
intelligently
he
never
asked
as
much
for
his
little
stages
and
therefore
obtained
more
custom
than
the
touchard
coaches
he
managed
to
elude
the
necessity
of
a
permit
if
need
were
he
was
willing
to
infringe
the
law
as
to
the
number
of
passengers
he
might
carry
in
short
he
possessed
the
affection
of
the
masses
and
thus
it
happened
that
whenever
a
rival
came
upon
the
same
route
if
his
days
for
running
were
not
the
same
as
those
of
the
coucou
travellers
would
put
off
their
journey
to
make
it
with
their
coachman
although
his
vehicle
and
his
horses
might
be
in
a
far
from
reassuring
condition
one
of
the
lines
which
the
touchards
father
and
son
endeavored
to
monopolize
and
the
one
most
stoutly
disputed
as
indeed
it
still
is
is
that
of
paris
to
a
line
extremely
profitable
for
three
rival
enterprises
worked
it
in
in
vain
the
touchards
lowered
their
price
in
vain
they
constructed
better
coaches
and
started
oftener
competition
still
continued
so
productive
is
a
line
on
which
are
little
towns
like
and
and
villages
like
pierrefitte
groslay
ecouen
poncelles
moisselles
monsoult
maffliers
franconville
presles
nointel
nerville
etc
the
touchard
coaches
finally
extended
their
route
to
chambly
but
competition
followed
the
toulouse
a
rival
enterprise
goes
as
far
as
beauvais
along
this
route
which
is
that
toward
england
there
lies
a
road
which
turns
off
at
a
place
in
view
of
its
topography
the
cave
and
leads
through
a
most
delightful
valley
in
the
basin
of
the
oise
to
the
little
town
of
doubly
celebrated
as
the
cradle
of
the
family
now
extinct
of
and
also
as
the
former
residence
of
the
is
a
little
town
flanked
by
two
large
villages
nogent
and
parmain
both
remarkable
for
splendid
quarries
which
have
furnished
material
for
many
of
the
finest
buildings
in
modern
paris
and
in
foreign
lands
for
the
base
and
capital
of
the
columns
of
the
brussels
theatre
are
of
nogent
stone
though
remarkable
for
its
beautiful
sites
for
the
famous
chateaux
which
princes
monks
and
designers
have
built
such
as
cassan
stors
le
val
nointel
persan
this
region
had
escaped
competition
in
and
was
reached
by
two
coaches
only
working
more
or
less
in
harmony
this
exception
to
the
rule
of
rivalry
was
founded
on
reasons
that
are
easy
to
understand
from
the
cave
the
point
on
the
route
to
england
where
a
paved
road
due
to
the
luxury
of
the
princes
of
conti
turned
off
to
the
distance
is
six
miles
no
speculating
enterprise
would
make
such
a
detour
for
was
the
terminus
of
the
road
which
did
not
go
beyond
it
of
late
years
another
road
has
been
made
between
the
valley
of
montmorency
and
the
valley
of
the
oise
but
in
the
only
road
which
led
to
was
the
paved
highway
of
the
princes
of
conti
pierrotin
and
his
colleague
reigned
therefore
from
paris
to
beloved
by
every
one
along
the
way
pierrotin
s
vehicle
together
with
that
of
his
comrade
and
pierrotin
himself
were
so
well
known
that
even
the
inhabitants
on
the
main
road
as
far
as
the
cave
were
in
the
habit
of
using
them
for
there
was
always
better
chance
of
a
seat
to
be
had
than
in
the
beaumont
coaches
which
were
almost
always
full
pierrotin
and
his
competitor
were
on
the
best
of
terms
when
the
former
started
from
the
latter
was
returning
from
paris
and
vice
versa
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
of
the
rival
pierrotin
possessed
the
sympathies
of
his
region
besides
he
is
the
only
one
of
the
two
who
appears
in
this
veracious
narrative
let
it
suffice
you
to
know
that
the
two
coach
proprietors
lived
under
a
good
understanding
rivalled
each
other
loyally
and
obtained
customers
by
honorable
proceedings
in
paris
they
used
for
economy
s
sake
the
same
yard
hotel
and
stable
the
same
office
and
clerk
this
detail
is
alone
sufficient
to
show
that
pierrotin
and
his
competitor
were
as
the
popular
saying
is
good
the
hotel
at
which
they
put
up
in
paris
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
d
enghien
is
still
there
and
is
called
the
lion
d
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
which
from
time
immemorial
had
lodged
coachmen
and
coaches
drove
himself
for
the
great
company
of
daumartin
which
was
so
firmly
established
that
its
neighbors
the
touchards
whose
place
of
business
was
directly
opposite
never
dreamed
of
starting
a
rival
coach
on
the
daumartin
line
though
the
departures
for
professed
to
take
place
at
a
fixed
hour
pierrotin
and
his
practised
an
indulgence
in
that
respect
which
won
for
them
the
grateful
affection
of
the
and
also
violent
remonstrances
on
the
part
of
strangers
accustomed
to
the
regularity
of
the
great
lines
of
public
conveyances
but
the
two
conductors
of
these
vehicles
which
were
half
diligence
half
coucou
were
invariably
defended
by
their
regular
customers
the
afternoon
departure
at
four
o
clock
usually
lagged
on
till
while
that
of
the
morning
fixed
for
eight
o
clock
was
seldom
known
to
take
place
before
nine
in
this
respect
however
the
system
was
elastic
in
summer
that
golden
period
for
the
coaching
business
the
rule
of
departure
rigorous
toward
strangers
was
often
relaxed
for
country
customers
this
method
not
infrequently
enabled
pierrotin
to
pocket
two
fares
for
one
place
if
a
countryman
came
early
and
wanted
a
seat
already
booked
and
paid
for
by
some
bird
of
passage
who
was
unluckily
for
himself
a
little
late
such
elasticity
will
certainly
not
commend
itself
to
purists
in
morality
but
pierrotin
and
his
colleague
justified
it
on
the
varied
grounds
of
hard
times
of
their
losses
during
the
winter
months
of
the
necessity
of
soon
getting
better
coaches
and
of
the
duty
of
keeping
exactly
to
the
rules
written
on
the
tariff
copies
of
which
were
however
never
shown
unless
some
chance
traveller
was
obstinate
enough
to
demand
it
pierrotin
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
was
already
the
father
of
a
family
released
from
the
cavalry
on
the
great
disbandment
of
the
worthy
fellow
had
succeeded
his
father
who
for
many
years
had
driven
a
coucou
of
capricious
flight
between
paris
and
having
married
the
daughter
of
a
small
he
enlarged
his
business
made
it
a
regular
service
and
became
noted
for
his
intelligence
and
a
certain
military
precision
active
and
decided
in
his
ways
pierrotin
the
name
seems
to
have
been
a
sobriquet
contrived
to
give
by
the
vivacity
of
his
countenance
an
expression
of
sly
shrewdness
to
his
ruddy
and
visage
which
suggested
wit
he
was
not
without
that
facility
of
speech
which
is
acquired
chiefly
through
seeing
life
and
other
countries
his
voice
by
dint
of
talking
to
his
horses
and
shouting
gare
was
rough
but
he
managed
to
tone
it
down
with
the
bourgeois
his
clothing
like
that
of
all
coachmen
of
the
second
class
consisted
of
stout
boots
heavy
with
nails
made
at
trousers
of
velveteen
waistcoat
of
the
same
over
which
he
wore
while
exercising
his
functions
a
blue
blouse
ornamented
on
the
collar
and
cuffs
with
embroidery
a
cap
with
a
visor
covered
his
head
his
military
career
had
left
in
pierrotin
s
manners
and
customs
a
great
respect
for
all
social
superiority
and
a
habit
of
obedience
to
persons
of
the
upper
classes
and
though
he
never
willingly
mingled
with
the
lesser
bourgeoisie
he
always
respected
women
in
whatever
station
of
life
they
belonged
nevertheless
by
dint
of
trundling
the
world
one
of
his
own
expressions
he
had
come
to
look
upon
those
he
conveyed
as
so
many
walking
parcels
who
required
less
care
than
the
inanimate
ones
the
essential
object
of
a
coaching
business
warned
by
the
general
movement
which
since
the
peace
was
revolutionizing
his
calling
pierrotin
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
outdone
by
the
progress
of
new
lights
since
the
beginning
of
the
summer
season
he
had
talked
much
of
a
certain
large
coach
ordered
from
farry
breilmann
and
company
the
best
makers
of
diligences
a
purchase
necessitated
by
an
increasing
influx
of
travellers
pierrotin
s
present
establishment
consisted
of
two
vehicles
one
which
served
in
winter
and
the
only
one
he
reported
to
the
was
the
coucou
which
he
inherited
from
his
father
the
rounded
flanks
of
this
vehicle
allowed
him
to
put
six
travellers
on
two
seats
of
metallic
hardness
in
spite
of
the
yellow
utrecht
velvet
with
which
they
were
covered
these
seats
were
separated
by
a
wooden
bar
inserted
in
the
sides
of
the
carriage
at
the
height
of
the
travellers
shoulders
which
could
be
placed
or
removed
at
will
this
bar
specially
covered
with
velvet
pierrotin
called
it
a
back
was
the
despair
of
the
passengers
from
the
great
difficulty
they
found
in
placing
and
removing
it
if
the
back
was
difficult
and
even
painful
to
handle
that
was
nothing
to
the
suffering
caused
to
the
omoplates
when
the
bar
was
in
place
but
when
it
was
left
to
lie
loose
across
the
coach
it
made
both
ingress
and
egress
extremely
perilous
especially
to
women
though
each
seat
of
this
vehicle
with
rounded
sides
like
those
of
a
pregnant
woman
could
rightfully
carry
only
three
passengers
it
was
not
uncommon
to
see
eight
persons
on
the
two
seats
jammed
together
like
herrings
in
a
barrel
pierrotin
declared
that
the
travellers
were
far
more
comfortable
in
a
solid
immovable
mass
whereas
when
only
three
were
on
a
seat
they
banged
each
other
perpetually
and
ran
much
risk
of
injuring
their
hats
against
the
roof
by
the
violent
jolting
of
the
roads
in
front
of
the
vehicle
was
a
wooden
bench
where
pierrotin
sat
on
which
three
travellers
could
perch
when
there
they
went
as
everybody
knows
by
the
name
of
on
certain
trips
pierrotin
placed
four
rabbits
on
the
bench
and
sat
himself
at
the
side
on
a
sort
of
box
placed
below
the
body
of
the
coach
as
a
for
the
rabbits
which
was
always
full
of
straw
or
of
packages
that
feared
no
damage
the
body
of
this
particular
coucou
was
painted
yellow
embellished
along
the
top
with
a
band
of
barber
s
blue
on
which
could
be
read
on
the
sides
in
silvery
white
letters
paris
and
across
the
back
line
to
our
descendants
will
be
mightily
mistaken
if
they
fancy
that
thirteen
persons
including
pierrotin
were
all
that
this
vehicle
could
carry
on
great
occasions
it
could
take
three
more
in
a
square
compartment
covered
with
an
awning
where
the
trunks
cases
and
packages
were
piled
but
the
prudent
pierrotin
only
allowed
his
regular
customers
to
sit
there
and
even
they
were
not
allowed
to
get
in
until
at
some
distance
beyond
the
the
occupants
of
the
the
name
given
by
conductors
to
this
section
of
their
vehicles
were
made
to
get
down
outside
of
every
village
or
town
where
there
was
a
post
of
gendarmerie
the
overloading
forbidden
by
law
for
the
safety
of
passengers
being
too
obvious
to
allow
the
gendarme
on
duty
always
a
friend
to
pierrotin
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
reporting
this
flagrant
violation
of
the
ordinances
thus
on
certain
saturday
nights
and
monday
mornings
pierrotin
s
coucou
trundled
fifteen
travellers
but
on
such
occasions
in
order
to
drag
it
along
he
gave
his
stout
old
horse
called
rougeot
a
mate
in
the
person
of
a
little
beast
no
bigger
than
a
pony
about
whose
merits
he
had
much
to
say
this
little
horse
was
a
mare
named
bichette
she
ate
little
she
was
spirited
she
was
indefatigable
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
my
wife
wouldn
t
give
her
for
that
fat
lazybones
of
a
rougeot
cried
pierrotin
when
some
traveller
would
joke
him
about
his
epitome
of
a
horse
the
difference
between
this
vehicle
and
the
other
consisted
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
the
other
was
on
four
wheels
this
coach
of
comical
construction
called
the
held
seventeen
travellers
though
it
was
bound
not
to
carry
more
than
fourteen
it
rumbled
so
noisily
that
the
inhabitants
of
frequently
said
here
comes
pierrotin
when
he
was
scarcely
out
of
the
forest
which
crowns
the
slope
of
the
valley
it
was
divided
into
two
lobes
so
to
speak
one
called
the
interior
contained
six
passengers
on
two
seats
the
other
a
sort
of
cabriolet
constructed
in
front
was
called
the
this
coupe
was
closed
in
with
very
inconvenient
and
fantastic
glass
sashes
a
description
of
which
would
take
too
much
space
to
allow
of
its
being
given
here
the
coach
was
surmounted
by
a
hooded
imperial
into
which
pierrotin
managed
to
poke
six
passengers
this
space
was
inclosed
by
leather
curtains
pierrotin
himself
sat
on
an
almost
invisible
seat
perched
just
below
the
sashes
of
the
coupe
the
master
of
the
establishment
paid
the
tax
which
was
levied
upon
all
public
conveyances
on
his
coucou
only
which
was
rated
to
carry
six
persons
and
he
took
out
a
special
permit
each
time
that
he
drove
the
this
may
seem
extraordinary
in
these
days
but
when
the
tax
on
vehicles
was
first
imposed
it
was
done
very
timidly
and
such
deceptions
were
easily
practised
by
the
coach
proprietors
always
pleased
to
faire
la
queue
cheat
of
their
dues
the
government
officials
to
use
the
argot
of
their
vocabulary
gradually
the
greedy
treasury
became
severe
it
forced
all
public
conveyances
not
to
roll
unless
they
carried
two
certificates
one
showing
that
they
had
been
weighed
the
other
that
their
taxes
were
duly
paid
all
things
have
their
salad
days
even
the
treasury
and
in
those
days
still
lasted
often
in
summer
the
and
the
coucou
journeyed
together
carrying
between
them
passengers
though
pierrotin
was
only
paying
a
tax
on
six
on
these
specially
lucky
days
the
convoy
started
from
the
faubourg
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
arrived
gallantly
at
by
ten
at
night
proud
of
this
service
which
necessitated
the
hire
of
an
extra
horse
pierrotin
was
wont
to
say
we
went
at
a
fine
pace
but
in
order
to
do
the
miles
in
five
hours
with
his
caravan
he
was
forced
to
omit
certain
stoppages
along
the
road
at
moisselles
and

the
hotel
du

occupies
a
piece
of
land
which
is
very
deep
for
its
width
though
its
frontage
has
only
three
or
four
windows
on
the
faubourg
the
building
extends
back
through
a
long
at
the
end
of
which
are
the
stables
forming
a
large
house
standing
close
against
the
division
wall
of
the
adjoining
property
the
entrance
is
through
a
sort
of
beneath
the
floor
of
the
second
story
in
which
two
or
three
coaches
had
room
to
stand
in
the
offices
of
all
the
lines
of
coaches
which
started
from
the

kept
by
the
wife
of
the
who
had
as
many
books
as
there
were
lines
she
received
the
fares
booked
the
passengers
and
stowed
away
in
her
vast
kitchen
the
various
packages
and
parcels
to
be
transported
travellers
were
satisfied
with
this
patriarchal
system
if
they
arrived
too
soon
they
seated
themselves
beneath
the
hood
of
the
huge
kitchen
chimney
or
stood
within
the
or
crossed
to
the
cafe
de
l

which
forms
the
corner
of
the
street
so
named
in
the
early
days
of
the
autumn
of
on
a
saturday
morning
pierrotin
was
standing
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
through
the
apertures
of
his
blouse
beneath
the
of
the
lion
d

whence
he
could
see
diagonally
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
and
through
the
long
to
the
stables
which
were
defined
in
black
at
the
end
of
it
daumartin
s
diligence
had
just
started
plunging
heavily
after
those
of
the
touchards
it
was
past
eight
o
clock
under
the
enormous
porch
or
passage
above
which
could
be
read
on
a
long
sign
hotel
du

stood
the
stablemen
and
porters
of
the
watching
the
lively
start
of
the
vehicles
which
deceives
so
many
travellers
making
them
believe
that
the
horses
will
be
kept
to
that
vigorous
gait
shall
i
harness
up
master
asked
pierrotin
s
hostler
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
seen
along
the
road
it
is
a
eight
and
i
don
t
see
any
travellers
replied
pierrotin
where
have
they
poked
themselves
yes
harness
up
all
the
same
and
there
are
no
parcels
either
twenty
good
gods
a
fine
day
like
this
and
i
ve
only
four
booked
a
pretty
state
of
things
for
a
saturday
it
is
always
the
same
when
you
want
money
a
dog
s
life
and
a
dog
s
business
if
you
had
more
where
would
you
put
them
there
s
nothing
left
but
the
cabriolet
said
the
hostler
intending
to
soothe
pierrotin
you
forget
the
new
coach
cried
pierrotin
have
you
really
got
it
asked
the
man
laughing
and
showing
a
set
of
teeth
as
white
and
broad
as
almonds
you
old
it
starts
i
tell
you
and
i
want
at
least
eighteen
passengers
for
ha
ha
a
fine
affair
it
ll
warm
up
the
road
said
the
hostler
a
coach
like
that
which
runs
to
beaumont
hey
flaming
painted
red
and
gold
to
make
touchard
burst
with
envy
it
takes
three
horses
i
have
bought
a
mate
for
rougeot
and
bichette
will
go
finely
in
unicorn
come
harness
up
added
pierrotin
glancing
out
towards
the
street
and
stuffing
the
tobacco
into
his
clay
pipe
i
see
a
lady
and
lad
over
there
with
packages
under
their
arms
they
are
coming
to
the
lion
d
argent
for
they
ve
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
coucous
tiens
tiens
seems
to
me
i
know
that
lady
for
an
old
you
ve
often
started
empty
and
arrived
full
said
his
porter
still
by
way
of
consolation
but
no
parcels
twenty
good
gods
what
a
fate
and
pierrotin
sat
down
on
one
of
the
huge
stone
posts
which
protected
the
walls
of
the
building
from
the
wheels
of
the
coaches
but
he
did
so
with
an
anxious
reflective
air
that
was
not
habitual
with
him
this
conversation
apparently
insignificant
had
stirred
up
cruel
anxieties
which
were
slumbering
in
his
breast
what
could
there
be
to
trouble
the
heart
of
pierrotin
in
a
fine
new
coach
to
shine
upon
the
road
to
rival
the
touchards
to
magnify
his
own
line
to
carry
passengers
who
would
compliment
him
on
the
conveniences
due
to
the
progress
of
instead
of
having
to
listen
to
perpetual
complaints
of
his
sabots
tires
of
enormous
width
such
was
pierrotin
s
laudable
ambition
but
carried
away
with
the
desire
to
outstrip
his
comrade
on
the
line
hoping
that
the
latter
might
some
day
retire
and
leave
to
him
alone
the
transportation
to
he
had
gone
too
far
the
coach
was
indeed
ordered
from
barry
breilmann
and
company
who
had
just
substituted
square
english
springs
for
those
called
and
other
french
contrivances
but
these
hard
and
distrustful
manufacturers
would
only
deliver
over
the
diligence
in
return
for
coin
not
particularly
pleased
to
build
a
vehicle
which
would
be
difficult
to
sell
if
it
remained
upon
their
hands
these
dealers
declined
to
undertake
it
at
all
until
pierrotin
had
made
a
preliminary
payment
of
two
thousand
francs
to
satisfy
this
precautionary
demand
pierrotin
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
and
all
his
credit
his
wife
his
and
his
friends
had
bled
this
superb
diligence
he
had
been
to
see
the
evening
before
at
the
painter
s
all
it
needed
now
was
to
be
set
but
to
make
it
roll
payment
in
full
must
alas
be
made
now
a
thousand
francs
were
lacking
to
pierrotin
and
where
to
get
them
he
did
not
know
he
was
in
debt
to
the
master
of
the
lion
d
argent
he
was
in
danger
of
his
losing
his
two
thousand
francs
already
paid
to
the
not
counting
five
hundred
for
the
mate
to
rougeot
and
three
hundred
for
new
harnesses
on
which
he
had
a
credit
driven
by
the
fury
of
despair
and
the
madness
of
vanity
he
had
just
openly
declared
that
the
new
coach
was
to
start
on
the
morrow
by
offering
fifteen
hundred
francs
instead
of
the
two
thousand
five
hundred
still
due
he
was
in
hopes
that
the
softened
would
give
him
his
coach
but
after
a
few
moments
meditation
his
feelings
led
him
to
cry
out
aloud
no
they
re
dogs
harpies
suppose
i
appeal
to
monsieur
moreau
the
steward
at
presles
he
is
such
a
kind
man
thought
pierrotin
struck
with
a
new
idea
perhaps
he
would
take
my
note
for
six
at
this
moment
a
footman
in
livery
carrying
a
leather
portmanteau
and
coming
from
the
touchard
establishment
where
he
had
gone
too
late
to
secure
places
as
far
as
chambly
came
up
and
said
are
you
pierrotin
say
on
replied
pierrotin
if
you
would
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
could
take
my
master
if
not
i
ll
carry
back
the
portmanteau
and
try
to
find
some
other
i
ll
wait
two
three
quarters
and
throw
a
little
in
besides
my
lad
said
pierrotin
eyeing
the
pretty
leather
trunk
well
buckled
and
bearing
a
brass
plate
with
a
coat
of
arms
very
good
then
take
this
said
the
valet
ridding
his
shoulder
of
the
trunk
which
pierrotin
lifted
weighed
and
examined
here
he
said
to
his
porter
wrap
it
up
carefully
in
soft
hay
and
put
it
in
the
boot
there
s
no
name
upon
it
he
added
monseigneur
s
arms
are
there
replied
the
valet
monseigneur
come
and
take
a
glass
said
pierrotin
nodding
toward
the
cafe
de
l
echiquier
whither
he
conducted
the
valet
waiter
two
absinthes
he
said
as
he
entered
who
is
your
master
and
where
is
he
going
i
have
never
seen
you
before
said
pierrotin
to
the
valet
as
they
touched
glasses
there
s
a
good
reason
for
that
said
the
footman
my
master
only
goes
into
your
parts
about
once
a
year
and
then
in
his
own
carriage
he
prefers
the
valley
d
orge
where
he
has
the
most
beautiful
park
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
a
perfect
versailles
a
family
estate
of
which
he
bears
the
name
don
t
you
know
monsieur
moreau
the
steward
of
presles
yes
monsieur
le
comte
is
going
down
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
with
ha
then
i
m
to
carry
monsieur
le
comte
de
serizy
cried
the
yes
my
land
neither
more
nor
less
but
listen
here
s
a
special
order
if
you
have
any
of
the
country
neighbors
in
your
coach
you
are
not
to
call
him
monsieur
le
comte
he
wants
to
travel
en
cognito
and
told
me
to
be
sure
to
say
he
would
pay
a
handsome
pourboire
if
he
was
not
so
has
this
secret
journey
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
which
pere
leger
the
farmer
at
the
moulineaux
came
to
paris
the
other
day
to
settle
i
don
t
know
replied
the
valet
but
the
fat
s
in
the
fire
last
night
i
was
sent
to
the
stable
to
order
the
daumont
carriage
to
be
ready
to
go
to
presles
at
seven
this
morning
but
when
seven
o
clock
came
monsieur
le
comte
countermanded
it
augustin
his
valet
de
chambre
attributes
the
change
to
the
visit
of
a
lady
who
called
last
night
and
again
this
morning
he
thought
she
came
from
the
could
she
have
told
him
anything
against
monsieur
moreau
the
best
of
men
the
most
honest
of
men
a
king
of
men
hey
he
might
have
made
a
deal
more
than
he
has
out
of
his
position
if
he
d
chosen
i
can
tell
you
then
he
was
foolish
answered
the
valet
sententiously
is
monsieur
le
serizy
going
to
live
at
presles
at
last
asked
pierrotin
for
you
know
they
have
just
repaired
and
refurnished
the
chateau
do
you
think
it
is
true
he
has
already
spent
two
hundred
thousand
francs
upon
it
if
you
or
i
had
half
what
he
has
spent
upon
it
you
and
i
would
be
rich
bourgeois
if
madame
la
comtesse
goes
there
ha
i
tell
you
what
no
more
ease
and
comfort
for
the
moreaus
said
the
valet
with
an
air
of
mystery
he
s
a
worthy
man
monsieur
moreau
remarked
pierrotin
thinking
of
the
thousand
francs
he
wanted
to
get
from
the
steward
he
is
a
man
who
makes
others
work
but
he
doesn
t
cheapen
what
they
do
and
he
gets
all
he
can
out
of
the
land
for
his
master
honest
man
he
often
comes
to
paris
and
gives
me
a
good
fee
he
has
lots
of
errands
for
me
to
do
in
paris
sometimes
three
or
four
packages
a
day
either
from
monsieur
or
madame
my
bill
for
cartage
alone
comes
to
fifty
francs
a
month
more
or
less
if
madame
does
set
up
to
be
somebody
she
s
fond
of
her
children
and
it
is
i
who
fetch
them
from
school
and
take
them
back
and
each
time
she
gives
me
five
francs
a
real
great
lady
couldn
t
do
better
than
that
and
every
time
i
have
any
one
in
the
coach
belonging
to
them
or
going
to
see
them
i
m
allowed
to
drive
up
to
the
chateau
that
s
all
right
isn
t
it
they
say
monsieur
moreau
wasn
t
worth
three
thousand
francs
when
monsieur
le
comte
made
him
steward
of
presles
said
the
valet
well
since
there
s
seventeen
years
and
the
man
ought
to
have
made
something
at
any
true
said
the
valet
nodding
anyway
masters
are
very
annoying
and
i
hope
for
moreau
s
sake
that
he
has
made
butter
for
his
i
have
often
been
to
your
house
in
the
rue
de
la
chaussee
d
antin
to
carry
baskets
of
game
said
pierrotin
but
i
ve
never
had
the
advantage
so
far
of
seeing
either
monsieur
or
monsieur
le
comte
is
a
good
man
said
the
footman
confidentially
but
if
he
insists
on
your
helping
to
keep
up
his
cognito
there
s
something
in
the
wind
at
any
rate
so
we
think
at
the
house
or
else
why
should
he
countermand
the
daumont
why
travel
in
a
coucou
a
peer
of
france
might
afford
to
hire
a
cabriolet
to
himself
one
would
a
cabriolet
would
cost
him
forty
francs
to
go
there
and
back
for
let
me
tell
you
if
you
don
t
know
it
that
road
was
only
made
for
squirrels
and
down
and
up
said
pierrotin
peer
of
france
or
bourgeois
they
are
all
looking
after
the
main
chance
and
saving
their
money
if
this
journey
concerns
monsieur
moreau
faith
i
d
be
sorry
any
harm
should
come
to
him
twenty
good
gods
hadn
t
i
better
find
some
way
of
warning
him
for
he
s
a
truly
good
man
a
kind
man
a
king
of
men
hey
pooh
monsieur
le
comte
thinks
everything
of
monsieur
moreau
replied
the
valet
but
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
good
advice
every
man
for
himself
in
this
world
we
have
enough
to
do
to
take
care
of
ourselves
do
what
monsieur
le
comte
asks
you
to
do
and
all
the
more
because
there
s
no
trifling
with
him
besides
to
tell
the
truth
the
count
is
generous
if
you
oblige
him
so
far
said
the
valet
pointing
down
his
little
finger
he
ll
send
you
on
as
far
as
that
stretching
out
his
arm
to
its
full
length
this
wise
reflection
and
the
action
that
enforced
it
had
the
effect
coming
from
a
man
who
stood
as
high
as
second
valet
to
the
comte
de
serizy
of
cooling
the
ardor
of
pierrotin
for
the
steward
of
presles
well
adieu
monsieur
pierrotin
said
the
valet
a
glance
rapidly
cast
on
the
life
of
the
comte
de
serizy
and
on
that
of
his
steward
is
here
necessary
in
order
to
fully
understand
the
little
drama
now
about
to
take
place
in
pierrotin

vehicle

proves
the
modesty
of
the

of
serizy
near
arpajon
where
the
respect
in
which
his
father
was
held
protected
him
from
all
danger
after
spending
several
years
in
taking
care
of
the
old
president
who
died
in
he
was
elected
about
that
time
to
the
council
of
the
five
hundred
and
accepted
those
legislative
functions
to
divert
his
mind
from
his
grief
after
the
brumaire
monsieur
de
serizy
became
like
so
many
other
of
the
old
parliamentary
families
an
object
of
the
first
consul
s
blandishment
he
was
appointed
to
the
council
of
state
and
received
one
of
the
most
disorganized
departments
of
the
government
to
reconstruct
this
scion
of
an
old
historical
family
proved
to
be
a
very
active
wheel
in
the
grand
and
magnificent
organization
which
we
owe
to
napoleon
the
councillor
of
state
was
soon
called
from
his
particular
administration
to
a
ministry
created
count
and
senator
by
the
emperor
he
was
made
proconsul
to
two
kingdoms
in
succession
in
when
forty
years
of
age
he
married
the
sister
of
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
the
widow
at
twenty
of
gaubert
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
the
republican
generals
who
left
her
his
whole
property
this
marriage
a
suitable
one
in
point
of
rank
doubled
the
already
considerable
fortune
of
the
comte
de
serizy
who
became
through
his
wife
the
of
the
marquis
de
rouvre
made
count
and
chamberlain
by
the
emperor
in
weary
with
constant
toil
the
comte
de
serizy
whose
shattered
health
required
rest
resigned
all
his
posts
left
the
department
at
the
head
of
which
the
emperor
had
placed
him
and
came
to
paris
where
napoleon
was
compelled
by
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
to
admit
that
the
count
s
illness
was
a
valid
excuse
though
at
first
that
master
who
gave
no
heed
to
the
fatigue
of
others
was
disposed
to
consider
monsieur
de
serizy
s
action
as
a
defection
though
the
senator
was
never
in
disgrace
he
was
supposed
to
have
reason
to
complain
of
napoleon
consequently
when
the
bourbons
returned
louis
whom
monsieur
de
serizy
held
to
be
his
legitimate
sovereign
treated
the
senator
now
a
peer
of
france
with
the
utmost
confidence
placed
him
in
charge
of
his
private
affairs
and
appointed
him
one
of
his
cabinet
ministers
on
the
of
march
monsieur
de
serizy
did
not
go
to
ghent
he
informed
napoleon
that
he
remained
faithful
to
the
house
of
bourbon
would
not
accept
his
peerage
during
the
hundred
days
and
passed
that
period
on
his
estate
at
serizy
after
the
second
fall
of
the
emperor
he
became
once
more
a
was
appointed
of
the
council
of
state
and
liquidator
on
behalf
of
france
of
claims
and
indemnities
demanded
by
foreign
powers
without
personal
assumption
without
ambition
even
he
possessed
great
influence
in
public
affairs
nothing
of
importance
was
done
without
consulting
him
but
he
never
went
to
court
and
was
seldom
seen
in
his
own
salons
this
noble
life
devoting
itself
from
its
very
beginning
to
work
had
ended
by
becoming
a
life
of
incessant
toil
the
count
rose
at
all
seasons
by
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
worked
till
attended
to
his
functions
as
peer
of
france
and
of
the
council
of
state
in
the
afternoons
and
went
to
bed
at
nine
o
clock
in
recognition
of
such
labor
the
king
had
made
him
a
knight
of
his
various
orders
monsieur
de
serizy
had
long
worn
the
grand
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
also
had
the
orders
of
the
golden
fleece
of
of
russia
that
of
the
prussian
eagle
and
nearly
all
the
lesser
orders
of
the
courts
of
europe
no
man
was
less
obvious
or
more
useful
in
the
political
world
than
he
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
world
s
honor
the
fuss
and
feathers
of
public
favor
the
glories
of
success
were
indifferent
to
a
man
of
this
stamp
but
no
one
unless
a
priest
ever
comes
to
life
of
this
kind
without
some
serious
underlying
reason
his
conduct
had
its
cause
and
a
cruel
one
in
love
with
his
wife
before
he
married
her
this
passion
had
lasted
through
all
the
secret
unhappiness
of
his
marriage
with
a
widow
a
woman
mistress
of
herself
before
as
well
as
after
her
second
marriage
and
who
used
her
liberty
all
the
more
freely
because
her
husband
treated
her
with
the
indulgence
of
a
mother
for
a
spoilt
child
his
constant
toil
served
him
as
shield
and
buckler
against
pangs
of
heart
which
he
silenced
with
the
care
that
diplomatists
give
to
the
keeping
of
secrets
he
knew
moreover
how
ridiculous
was
jealousy
in
the
eyes
of
a
society
that
would
never
have
believed
in
the
conjugal
passion
of
an
old
statesman
how
happened
it
that
from
the
earliest
days
of
his
marriage
his
wife
so
fascinated
him
why
did
he
suffer
without
resistance
how
was
it
that
he
dared
not
resist
why
did
he
let
the
years
go
by
and
still
hope
on
by
what
means
did
this
young
and
pretty
and
clever
woman
hold
him
in
bondage
the
answer
to
all
these
questions
would
require
a
long
history
which
would
injure
our
present
tale
let
us
only
remark
here
that
the
constant
toil
and
grief
of
the
count
had
unfortunately
contributed
not
a
little
to
deprive
him
of
personal
advantages
very
necessary
to
a
man
who
attempts
to
struggle
against
dangerous
comparisons
in
fact
the
most
cruel
of
the
count
s
secret
sorrows
was
that
of
causing
repugnance
to
his
wife
by
a
malady
of
the
skin
resulting
solely
from
excessive
labor
kind
and
always
considerate
of
the
countess
he
allowed
her
to
be
mistress
of
herself
and
her
home
she
received
all
paris
she
went
into
the
country
she
returned
from
it
precisely
as
though
she
were
still
a
widow
he
took
care
of
her
fortune
and
supplied
her
luxury
as
a
steward
might
have
done
the
countess
had
the
utmost
respect
for
her
husband
she
even
admired
his
turn
of
mind
she
knew
how
to
make
him
happy
by
approbation
she
could
do
what
she
pleased
with
him
by
simply
going
to
his
study
and
talking
for
an
hour
with
him
like
the
great
seigneurs
of
the
olden
time
the
count
protected
his
wife
so
loyally
that
a
single
word
of
disrespect
said
of
her
would
have
been
to
him
an
unpardonable
injury
the
world
admired
him
for
this
and
madame
de
serizy
owed
much
to
it
any
other
woman
even
though
she
came
of
a
family
as
distinguished
as
the
ronquerolles
might
have
found
herself
degraded
in
public
opinion
the
countess
was
ungrateful
but
she
mingled
a
charm
with
her
ingratitude
from
time
to
time
she
shed
a
balm
upon
the
wounds
of
her
husband
s
heart
let
us
now
explain
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
journey
and
the
incognito
maintained
by
a
minister
of
state
a
rich
farmer
of
named
leger
leased
and
cultivated
a
farm
the
fields
of
which
projected
into
and
greatly
injured
the
magnificent
estate
of
the
comte
de
serizy
called
presles
this
farm
belonged
to
a
burgher
of
named
margueron
the
lease
made
to
leger
in
at
a
time
when
the
great
advance
of
agriculture
was
not
foreseen
was
about
to
expire
and
the
owner
of
the
farm
refused
all
offers
from
leger
to
renew
the
lease
for
some
time
past
monsieur
de
serizy
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
the
annoyances
and
petty
disputes
caused
by
the
inclosure
of
these
fields
within
his
land
had
desired
to
buy
the
farm
having
heard
that
monsieur
margueron
s
chief
ambition
was
to
have
his
only
son
then
a
mere
made
special
collector
of
finances
at
beaumont
the
farmer
who
knew
he
could
sell
the
fields
piecemeal
to
the
count
at
a
high
price
was
ready
to
pay
margueron
even
more
than
he
expected
from
the
count
thus
matters
stood
when
two
days
earlier
than
that
of
which
we
write
monsieur
de
serizy
anxious
to
end
the
matter
sent
for
his
notary
alexandre
crottat
and
his
lawyer
derville
to
examine
into
all
the
circumstances
of
the
affair
though
derville
and
crottat
threw
some
doubt
on
the
zeal
of
the
count
s
steward
a
disturbing
letter
from
whom
had
led
to
the
consultation
monsieur
de
serizy
defended
moreau
who
he
said
had
served
him
faithfully
for
seventeen
years
very
well
said
derville
then
i
advise
your
excellency
to
go
to
presles
yourself
and
invite
this
margueron
to
dinner
crottat
will
send
his
with
a
deed
of
sale
drawn
up
leaving
only
the
necessary
lines
for
description
of
property
and
titles
in
blank
your
excellency
should
take
with
you
part
of
the
purchase
money
in
a
check
on
the
bank
of
france
not
forgetting
the
appointment
of
the
son
to
the
collectorship
if
you
don
t
settle
the
thing
at
once
that
farm
will
slip
through
your
fingers
you
don
t
know
monsieur
le
comte
the
trickery
of
these
peasants
peasants
against
diplomat
and
the
diplomat
crottat
agreed
in
this
advice
which
the
count
if
we
may
judge
by
the
valet
s
statements
to
pierrotin
had
adopted
the
preceding
evening
he
had
sent
moreau
a
line
by
the
diligence
to
beaumont
telling
him
to
invite
margueron
to
dinner
in
order
that
they
might
then
and
there
close
the
purchase
of
the
farm
of
moulineaux
before
this
matter
came
up
the
count
had
already
ordered
the
chateau
of
presles
to
be
restored
and
refurnished
and
for
the
last
year
grindot
an
architect
then
in
fashion
was
in
the
habit
of
making
a
weekly
visit
so
while
concluding
his
purchase
of
the
farm
monsieur
de
serizy
also
intended
to
examine
the
work
of
restoration
and
the
effect
of
the
new
furniture
he
intended
all
this
to
be
a
surprise
to
his
wife
when
he
brought
her
to
presles
and
with
this
idea
in
his
mind
he
had
put
some
personal
pride
and
into
the
work
how
came
it
therefore
that
the
count
who
intended
in
the
evening
to
drive
to
presles
openly
in
his
own
carriage
should
be
starting
early
the
next
morning
incognito
in
pierrotin
s
coucou
here
a
few
words
on
the
life
of
the
steward
moreau
become
indispensable
moreau
steward
of
the
state
of
presles
was
the
son
of
a
provincial
attorney
who
became
during
the
revolution
at
versailles
in
that
position
moreau
the
father
had
been
the
means
of
almost
saving
both
the
lives
and
property
of
the
serizys
father
and
son
citizen
moreau
belonged
to
the
danton
party
robespierre
implacable
in
his
hatreds
pursued
him
discovered
him
and
finally
had
him
executed
at
versailles
moreau
the
son
heir
to
the
doctrines
and
friendships
of
his
father
was
concerned
in
one
of
the
conspiracies
which
assailed
the
first
consul
on
his
accession
to
power
at
this
crisis
monsieur
de
serizy
anxious
to
pay
his
debt
of
gratitude
enabled
moreau
lying
under
sentence
of
death
to
make
his
escape
in
he
asked
for
his
pardon
obtained
it
offered
him
first
a
place
in
his
government
office
and
finally
took
him
as
private
secretary
for
his
own
affairs
some
time
after
the
marriage
of
his
patron
moreau
fell
in
love
with
the
countess
s
and
married
her
to
avoid
the
annoyances
of
the
false
position
in
which
this
marriage
placed
him
more
than
one
example
of
which
could
be
seen
at
the
imperial
court
moreau
asked
the
count
to
give
him
the
management
of
the
presles
estate
where
his
wife
could
play
the
lady
in
a
country
region
and
neither
of
them
would
be
made
to
suffer
from
wounded
the
count
wanted
a
trustworthy
man
at
presles
for
his
wife
preferred
serizy
an
estate
only
fifteen
miles
from
paris
for
three
or
four
years
moreau
had
held
the
key
of
the
count
s
affairs
he
was
intelligent
and
before
the
revolution
he
had
studied
law
in
his
father
s
office
so
monsieur
de
serizy
granted
his
request
you
can
never
advance
in
life
he
said
to
moreau
for
you
have
broken
your
neck
but
you
can
be
happy
and
i
will
take
care
that
you
are
he
gave
moreau
a
salary
of
three
thousand
francs
and
his
residence
in
a
charming
lodge
near
the
chateau
all
the
wood
he
needed
from
the
timber
that
was
cut
on
the
estate
oats
hay
and
straw
for
two
horses
and
a
right
to
whatever
he
wanted
of
the
produce
of
the
gardens
a
is
not
as
well
provided
for
during
the
first
eight
years
of
his
stewardship
moreau
managed
the
estate
conscientiously
he
took
an
interest
in
it
the
count
coming
down
now
and
then
to
examine
the
property
pass
judgment
on
what
had
been
done
and
decide
on
new
purchases
was
struck
with
moreau
s
evident
loyalty
and
showed
his
satisfaction
by
liberal
gifts
but
after
the
birth
of
moreau
s
third
child
a
daughter
he
felt
himself
so
securely
settled
in
all
his
comforts
at
presles
that
he
ceased
to
attribute
to
monsieur
de
serizy
those
enormous
advantages
about
the
year
the
steward
who
until
then
had
only
taken
what
he
needed
for
his
own
use
from
the
estate
accepted
a
sum
of
thousand
francs
from
a
as
an
inducement
to
lease
to
the
latter
for
twelve
years
the
cutting
of
all
the
timber
moreau
argued
this
he
could
have
no
pension
he
was
the
father
of
a
family
the
count
really
owed
him
that
sum
as
a
gift
after
ten
years
management
already
the
legitimate
possessor
of
sixty
thousand
francs
in
savings
if
he
added
this
sum
to
that
he
could
buy
a
farm
worth
a
hundred
and
thousand
francs
in
champagne
a
township
just
above
on
the
right
bank
of
the
oise
political
events
prevented
both
the
count
and
the
neighboring
from
becoming
aware
of
this
investment
which
was
made
in
the
name
of
madame
moreau
who
was
understood
to
have
inherited
property
from
an
aunt
of
her
father
as
soon
as
the
steward
had
tasted
the
delightful
fruit
of
the
possession
of
the
property
he
began
all
the
while
maintaining
toward
the
world
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
integrity
to
lose
no
occasion
of
increasing
his
fortune
clandestinely
the
interests
of
his
three
children
served
as
a
poultice
to
the
wounds
of
his
honor
nevertheless
we
ought
in
justice
to
say
that
while
he
accepted
casks
of
wine
and
took
care
of
himself
in
all
the
purchases
that
he
made
for
the
count
yet
according
to
the
terms
of
the
code
he
remained
an
honest
man
and
no
proof
could
have
been
found
to
justify
an
accusation
against
him
according
to
the
jurisprudence
of
the
least
thieving
cook
in
paris
he
shared
with
the
count
in
the
profits
due
to
his
own
capable
management
this
manner
of
swelling
his
fortune
was
simply
a
case
of
conscience
that
was
all
alert
and
thoroughly
understanding
the
count
s
interests
moreau
watched
for
opportunities
to
make
good
purchases
all
the
more
eagerly
because
he
gained
a
larger
percentage
on
them
presles
returned
a
revenue
of
seventy
thousand
francs
net
it
was
a
saying
of
the
for
a
circuit
of
thirty
miles
monsieur
de
serizy
has
a
second
self
in
being
a
prudent
man
moreau
invested
yearly
after
both
his
profits
and
his
salary
on
the
grand
livre
piling
up
his
heap
with
the
utmost
secrecy
he
often
refused
proposals
on
the
plea
of
want
of
money
and
he
played
the
poor
man
so
successfully
with
the
count
that
the
latter
gave
him
the
means
to
send
both
his
sons
to
the
school
henri
iv
at
the
present
moment
moreau
was
worth
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
of
capital
invested
in
the
consolidated
thirds
now
paying
five
per
cent
and
quoted
at
eighty
francs
these
carefully
hidden
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
and
his
farm
at
champagne
enlarged
by
subsequent
purchases
amounted
to
a
fortune
of
about
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
francs
giving
him
an
income
of
some
sixteen
thousand
such
was
the
position
of
the
steward
at
the
time
when
the
comte
de
serizy
desired
to
purchase
the
farm
of
moulineaux
the
ownership
of
which
was
indispensable
to
his
comfort
this
farm
consisted
of
parcels
of
land
bordering
the
estate
of
presles
and
frequently
running
into
it
producing
the
most
annoying
discussions
as
to
the
trimming
of
hedges
and
ditches
and
the
cutting
of
trees
any
other
than
a
cabinet
minister
would
probably
have
had
scores
of
lawsuits
on
his
hands
pere
leger
only
wished
to
buy
the
property
in
order
to
sell
to
the
count
at
a
handsome
advance
in
order
to
secure
the
exorbitant
sum
on
which
his
mind
was
set
the
farmer
had
long
endeavored
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
moreau
impelled
by
circumstances
he
had
only
three
days
before
this
critical
sunday
had
a
talk
with
the
steward
in
the
open
field
and
proved
to
him
clearly
that
he
moreau
could
make
the
count
invest
his
money
at
two
and
a
half
per
cent
and
thus
appear
to
serve
his
patron
s
interests
while
he
himself
pocketed
forty
thousand
francs
which
leger
offered
him
to
bring
about
the
transaction
i
tell
you
what
said
the
steward
to
his
wife
as
he
went
to
bed
that
night
if
i
make
fifty
thousand
francs
out
of
the
moulineaux
affair
and
i
certainly
shall
for
the
count
will
give
me
ten
thousand
as
a
fee
we
ll
retire
to
and
live
in
the
pavillon
de
this
pavillon
was
a
charming
place
originally
built
by
the
prince
de
conti
for
a
mistress
and
in
it
every
convenience
and
luxury
had
been
placed
that
will
suit
me
said
his
wife
the
dutchman
who
lives
there
has
put
it
in
good
order
and
now
that
he
is
obliged
to
return
to
india
he
would
probably
let
us
have
it
for
thirty
thousand
we
shall
be
close
to
champagne
said
moreau
i
am
in
hopes
of
buying
the
farm
and
mill
of
mours
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
that
would
give
us
ten
thousand
a
year
in
rentals
nogent
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
residences
in
the
valley
and
we
should
still
have
an
income
of
ten
thousand
from
the
but
why
don
t
you
ask
for
the
post
of
at
that
would
give
us
influence
and
fifteen
hundred
a
year
well
i
did
think
of
with
these
plans
in
mind
moreau
as
soon
as
he
heard
from
the
count
that
he
was
coming
to
presles
and
wished
him
to
invite
margueron
to
dinner
on
saturday
sent
off
an
express
to
the
count
s
inclosing
a
letter
to
his
master
which
the
messenger
failed
to
deliver
before
monsieur
de
serizy
retired
at
his
usually
early
hour
augustin
however
placed
it
according
to
custom
in
such
cases
on
his
master
s
desk
in
this
letter
moreau
begged
the
count
not
to
trouble
himself
to
come
down
but
to
trust
entirely
to
him
he
added
that
margueron
was
no
longer
willing
to
sell
the
whole
in
one
block
and
talked
of
cutting
the
farm
up
into
a
number
of
smaller
lots
it
was
necessary
to
circumvent
this
plan
and
perhaps
added
moreau
it
might
be
best
to
employ
a
third
party
to
make
the
purchase
everybody
has
enemies
in
this
life
now
the
steward
and
his
wife
had
wounded
the
feelings
of
a
retired
army
officer
monsieur
de
reybert
and
his
wife
who
were
living
near
presles
from
speeches
like
matters
had
advanced
to
monsieur
de
reybert
breathed
vengeance
he
was
determined
to
make
moreau
lose
his
situation
and
gain
it
himself
the
two
ideas
were
twins
thus
the
proceedings
of
the
steward
spied
upon
for
two
years
were
no
secret
to
reybert
the
same
conveyance
that
took
moreau
s
letter
to
the
count
conveyed
madame
de
reybert
whom
her
husband
despatched
to
paris
there
she
asked
with
such
earnestness
to
see
the
count
that
although
she
was
sent
away
at
nine
o
clock
he
having
then
gone
to
bed
she
was
ushered
into
his
study
the
next
morning
at
seven
monsieur
she
said
to
the
we
are
incapable
my
husband
and
i
of
writing
anonymous
letters
therefore
i
have
come
to
see
you
in
person
i
am
madame
de
reybert
nee
de
corroy
my
husband
is
a
retired
officer
with
a
pension
of
six
hundred
francs
and
we
live
at
presles
where
your
steward
has
offered
us
insult
after
insult
although
we
are
persons
of
good
station
monsieur
de
reybert
who
is
not
an
intriguing
man
far
from
it
is
a
captain
of
artillery
retired
in
having
served
twenty
years
always
at
a
distance
from
the
emperor
monsieur
le
comte
you
know
of
course
how
difficult
it
is
for
soldiers
who
are
not
under
the
eye
of
their
master
to
obtain
promotion
not
counting
that
the
integrity
and
frankness
of
monsieur
de
reybert
were
displeasing
to
his
superiors
my
husband
has
watched
your
steward
for
the
last
three
years
being
aware
of
his
dishonesty
and
intending
to
have
him
lose
his
place
we
are
as
you
see
quite
frank
with
you
moreau
has
made
us
his
enemies
and
we
have
watched
him
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
are
being
tricked
in
the
purchase
of
the
moulineaux
farm
they
mean
to
get
an
extra
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
you
which
are
to
be
divided
between
the
notary
the
farmer
leger
and
moreau
you
have
written
moreau
to
invite
margueron
and
you
are
going
to
presles
but
margueron
will
be
ill
and
leger
is
so
certain
of
buying
the
farm
that
he
is
now
in
paris
to
draw
the
money
if
we
have
enlightened
you
as
to
what
is
going
on
and
if
you
want
an
upright
steward
you
will
take
my
husband
though
noble
he
will
serve
you
as
he
has
served
the
state
your
steward
has
made
a
fortune
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
out
of
his
place
he
is
not
to
be
pitied
the
count
thanked
madame
de
reybert
coldly
bestowing
upon
her
the
of
courts
for
he
despised
backbiting
but
for
all
that
he
remembered
derville
s
doubts
and
felt
inwardly
shaken
just
then
he
saw
his
steward
s
letter
and
read
it
in
its
assurances
of
devotion
and
its
respectful
reproaches
for
the
distrust
implied
in
wishing
to
negotiate
the
purchase
for
himself
he
read
the
truth
corruption
has
come
to
him
with
fortune
as
it
always
does
he
said
to
himself
the
count
then
made
several
inquiries
of
madame
de
reybert
less
to
obtain
information
than
to
gain
time
to
observe
her
and
he
wrote
a
short
note
to
his
notary
telling
him
not
to
send
his
to
presles
as
requested
but
to
come
there
himself
in
time
for
dinner
though
monsieur
le
comte
said
madame
de
reybert
in
conclusion
may
have
judged
me
unfavorably
for
the
step
i
have
taken
unknown
to
my
husband
he
ought
to
be
convinced
that
we
have
obtained
this
information
about
his
steward
in
a
natural
and
honorable
manner
the
most
sensitive
conscience
can
not
take
exception
to
so
saying
madame
de
reybert
nee
de
corroy
stood
erect
as
a
she
presented
to
the
rapid
investigation
of
the
count
a
face
seamed
with
the
like
a
colander
with
holes
a
flat
spare
figure
two
light
and
eager
eyes
fair
hair
plastered
down
upon
an
anxious
forehead
a
small
of
faded
green
taffetas
lined
with
pink
a
white
gown
with
violet
spots
and
leather
shoes
the
count
recognized
the
wife
of
some
poor
captain
a
puritan
subscribing
no
doubt
to
the
courrier
francais
earnest
in
virtue
but
aware
of
the
comfort
of
a
good
situation
and
eagerly
coveting
it
you
say
your
husband
has
a
pension
of
six
hundred
francs
he
said
replying
to
his
own
thoughts
and
not
to
the
remark
madame
de
reybert
had
just
made
yes
you
were
born
a
corroy
yes
monsieur
a
noble
family
of
metz
where
my
husband
in
what
regiment
did
monsieur
de
reybert
serve
the
good
said
the
count
writing
down
the
number
he
had
thought
at
one
time
of
giving
the
management
of
the
estate
to
some
retired
army
officer
about
whom
he
could
obtain
exact
information
from
the
minister
of
war
madame
he
resumed
ringing
for
his
valet
return
to
presles
this
afternoon
with
my
notary
who
is
going
down
there
for
dinner
and
to
whom
i
have
recommended
you
here
is
his
address
i
am
going
myself
secretly
to
presles
and
will
send
for
monsieur
de
reybert
to
come
and
speak
to
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
monsieur
de
serizy
s
journey
by
a
public
conveyance
and
the
injunction
conveyed
by
the
valet
to
conceal
his
name
and
rank
had
not
unnecessarily
alarmed
pierrotin
that
worthy
had
just
forebodings
of
a
danger
which
was
about
to
swoop
down
upon
one
of
his
best
customers
chapter
iii
the
travellers
as
pierrotin
issued
from
the
cafe
de
l
echiquier
after
treating
the
valet
he
saw
in
the
of
the
lion
d
argent
the
lady
and
the
young
man
in
whom
his
perspicacity
at
once
detected
customers
for
the
lady
with
outstretched
neck
and
anxious
face
was
evidently
looking
for
him
she
was
dressed
in
a
gown
that
was
dyed
a
brown
bonnet
an
old
french
cashmere
shawl
stockings
and
low
shoes
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
straw
bag
and
a
blue
umbrella
this
woman
who
had
once
been
beautiful
seemed
to
be
about
forty
years
of
age
but
her
blue
eyes
deprived
of
the
fire
which
happiness
puts
there
told
plainly
that
she
had
long
renounced
the
world
her
dress
as
well
as
her
whole
air
and
demeanor
indicated
a
mother
wholly
devoted
to
her
household
and
her
son
if
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
were
faded
the
shape
betrayed
that
it
was
several
years
old
the
shawl
was
fastened
by
a
broken
needle
converted
into
a
pin
by
a
bead
of
she
was
waiting
impatiently
for
pierrotin
wishing
to
recommend
to
his
special
care
her
son
who
was
doubtless
travelling
for
the
first
time
and
with
whom
she
had
come
to
the
as
much
from
doubt
of
his
ability
as
from
maternal
affection
this
mother
was
in
every
way
completed
by
the
son
so
that
the
son
would
not
be
understood
without
the
mother
if
the
mother
condemned
herself
to
mended
gloves
the
son
wore
an
coat
with
sleeves
too
short
for
him
proving
that
he
had
grown
and
might
grow
still
more
like
other
adults
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
the
blue
trousers
mended
by
his
mother
presented
to
the
eye
a
brighter
patch
of
color
when
the
maliciously
parted
behind
him
don
t
rub
your
gloves
that
way
you
ll
spoil
them
she
was
saying
as
pierrotin
appeared
is
this
the
conductor
ah
pierrotin
is
it
you
she
exclaimed
leaving
her
son
and
taking
the
coachman
apart
a
few
steps
i
hope
you
re
well
madame
clapart
he
replied
with
an
air
that
expressed
both
respect
and
familiarity
yes
pierrotin
very
well
please
take
good
care
of
my
oscar
he
is
travelling
alone
for
the
first
oh
so
he
is
going
alone
to
monsieur
moreau
cried
pierrotin
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
he
were
really
going
there
yes
said
the
mother
then
madame
moreau
is
willing
returned
pierrotin
with
a
sly
look
ah
said
the
mother
it
will
not
be
all
roses
for
him
poor
child
but
his
future
absolutely
requires
that
i
should
send
this
answer
struck
pierrotin
who
hesitated
to
confide
his
fears
for
the
steward
to
madame
clapart
while
she
on
her
part
was
afraid
of
injuring
her
boy
if
she
asked
pierrotin
for
a
care
which
might
have
transformed
him
into
a
mentor
during
this
short
deliberation
which
was
ostensibly
covered
by
a
few
phrases
as
to
the
weather
the
journey
and
the
along
the
road
we
will
ourselves
explain
what
were
the
ties
that
united
madame
clapart
with
pierrotin
and
authorized
the
two
confidential
remarks
which
they
have
just
exchanged
often
that
is
to
say
three
or
four
times
a
month
pierrotin
on
his
way
to
paris
would
find
the
steward
on
the
road
near
la
cave
as
soon
as
the
vehicle
came
up
moreau
would
sign
to
a
gardener
who
with
pierrotin
s
help
would
put
upon
the
coach
either
one
or
two
baskets
containing
the
fruits
and
vegetables
of
the
season
chickens
eggs
butter
and
game
the
steward
always
paid
the
carriage
and
pierrotin
s
fee
adding
the
money
necessary
to
pay
the
toll
at
the
barriere
if
the
baskets
contained
anything
dutiable
these
baskets
hampers
or
packages
were
never
directed
to
any
one
on
the
first
occasion
which
served
for
all
others
the
steward
had
given
madame
clapart
s
address
by
word
of
mouth
to
the
discreet
pierrotin
requesting
him
never
to
deliver
to
others
the
precious
packages
pierrotin
impressed
with
the
idea
of
an
intrigue
between
the
steward
and
some
pretty
girl
had
gone
as
directed
to
number
rue
de
la
cerisaie
in
the
arsenal
quarter
and
had
there
found
the
madame
clapart
just
portrayed
instead
of
the
young
and
beautiful
creature
he
expected
to
find
the
drivers
of
public
conveyances
and
carriers
are
called
by
their
business
to
enter
many
homes
and
to
be
cognizant
of
many
secrets
but
social
accident
that
having
willed
that
they
be
without
education
and
devoid
of
the
talent
of
observation
it
follows
that
they
are
not
dangerous
nevertheless
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
pierrotin
was
puzzled
to
explain
the
exact
relations
of
monsieur
moreau
and
madame
clapart
from
what
he
saw
of
the
household
in
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
though
lodgings
were
not
dear
at
that
time
in
the
arsenal
quarter
madame
clapart
lived
on
a
third
floor
at
the
end
of
a
in
a
house
which
was
formerly
that
of
a
great
family
in
the
days
when
the
higher
nobility
of
the
kingdom
lived
on
the
ancient
site
of
the
palais
des
tournelles
and
the
hotel
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
great
seigneurs
divided
among
themselves
these
vast
spaces
once
occupied
by
the
gardens
of
the
kings
of
france
as
indicated
by
the
present
names
of
the
streets
cerisaie
beautreillis
des
lions
etc
madame
clapart
s
apartment
which
was
panelled
throughout
with
ancient
carvings
consisted
of
three
connecting
rooms
a
salon
and
bedroom
above
it
was
the
kitchen
and
a
bedroom
for
oscar
opposite
to
the
entrance
on
what
is
called
in
paris
le
carre
that
is
the
square
landing
was
the
door
of
a
back
room
opening
on
every
floor
into
a
sort
of
tower
built
of
rough
stone
in
which
was
also
the
well
for
the
staircase
this
was
the
room
in
which
moreau
slept
whenever
he
went
to
paris
pierrotin
had
seen
in
the
first
room
where
he
deposited
the
hampers
six
wooden
chairs
with
straw
seats
a
table
and
a
sideboard
at
the
windows
discolored
curtains
later
when
he
entered
the
salon
he
noticed
some
old
empire
furniture
now
shabby
but
only
as
much
as
all
proprietors
exact
to
secure
their
rent
pierrotin
judged
of
the
bedroom
by
the
salon
and
the
painted
coarsely
of
a
reddish
white
which
thickened
and
blurred
the
mouldings
and
figurines
far
from
being
ornamental
was
distressing
to
the
eye
the
floors
never
waxed
were
of
that
gray
tone
we
see
in
when
pierrotin
came
upon
monsieur
and
madame
clapart
at
their
meals
he
saw
that
their
china
glass
and
all
other
little
articles
betrayed
the
utmost
poverty
and
yet
though
the
chipped
and
mended
dishes
and
tureens
were
those
of
the
poorest
families
and
provoked
pity
the
forks
and
spoons
were
of
silver
monsieur
clapart
clothed
in
a
shabby
surtout
his
feet
in
broken
slippers
always
wore
green
spectacles
and
exhibited
whenever
he
removed
his
shabby
cap
of
a
bygone
period
a
pointed
skull
from
the
top
of
which
trailed
a
few
dirty
filaments
which
even
a
poet
could
scarcely
call
hair
this
man
of
wan
complexion
seemed
timorous
but
withal
tyrannical
in
this
dreary
apartment
which
faced
the
north
and
had
no
other
outlook
than
to
a
vine
on
the
opposite
wall
and
a
well
in
the
corner
of
the
yard
madame
clapart
bore
herself
with
the
airs
of
a
queen
and
moved
like
a
woman
unaccustomed
to
go
anywhere
on
foot
often
while
thanking
pierrotin
she
gave
him
glances
which
would
have
touched
to
pity
an
intelligent
observer
from
time
to
time
she
would
slip
a
piece
into
his
hand
and
then
her
voice
was
charming
pierrotin
had
never
seen
oscar
for
the
reason
that
the
boy
was
always
in
school
at
the
time
his
business
took
him
to
the
house
here
is
the
sad
story
which
pierrotin
could
never
have
discovered
even
by
asking
for
information
as
he
sometimes
did
from
the
portress
of
the
house
for
that
individual
knew
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
claparts
paid
a
rent
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
year
had
no
servant
but
a
charwoman
who
came
daily
for
a
few
hours
in
the
morning
that
madame
clapart
did
some
of
her
smaller
washing
herself
and
paid
the
postage
on
her
letters
daily
being
apparently
unable
to
let
the
sum
accumulate
there
does
not
exist
or
rather
there
seldom
exists
a
criminal
who
is
wholly
criminal
neither
do
we
ever
meet
with
a
dishonest
nature
which
is
completely
dishonest
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
cheat
his
master
to
his
own
advantage
or
rake
in
for
himself
alone
all
the
hay
in
the
manger
but
even
while
laying
up
capital
by
actions
more
or
less
illicit
there
are
few
men
who
never
do
good
ones
if
only
from
curiosity
or
by
way
of
variety
or
by
chance
every
man
has
his
moment
of
beneficence
he
may
call
it
his
error
he
may
never
do
it
again
but
he
sacrifices
to
goodness
as
the
most
surly
man
sacrifices
to
the
graces
once
or
twice
in
his
life
if
moreau
s
faults
can
ever
be
excused
it
might
be
on
the
score
of
his
persistent
kindness
in
succoring
a
woman
of
whose
favors
he
had
once
been
proud
and
in
whose
house
he
was
hidden
when
in
peril
of
his
life
this
woman
celebrated
under
the
directory
for
her
liaison
with
one
of
the
five
kings
of
that
reign
married
through
that
protection
a
purveyor
who
was
making
his
millions
out
of
the
government
and
whom
napoleon
ruined
in
this
man
named
husson
became
insane
through
his
sudden
fall
from
opulence
to
poverty
he
flung
himself
into
the
seine
leaving
the
beautiful
madame
husson
pregnant
moreau
very
intimately
allied
with
madame
husson
was
at
that
time
condemned
to
death
he
was
unable
therefore
to
marry
the
widow
being
forced
to
leave
france
madame
husson
then
years
old
married
in
her
deep
distress
a
government
clerk
named
clapart
aged
who
was
said
to
be
a
rising
man
at
that
period
of
our
history
government
clerks
were
apt
to
become
persons
of
importance
for
napoleon
was
ever
on
the
lookout
for
capacity
but
clapart
though
endowed
by
nature
with
a
certain
coarse
beauty
proved
to
have
no
intelligence
thinking
madame
husson
very
rich
he
feigned
a
great
passion
for
her
and
was
simply
saddled
with
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
either
then
or
in
the
future
the
wants
she
had
acquired
in
a
life
of
opulence
he
filled
very
poorly
a
place
in
the
treasury
that
gave
him
a
salary
of
eighteen
hundred
francs
which
was
all
the
new
household
had
to
live
on
when
moreau
returned
to
france
as
the
secretary
of
the
comte
de
serizy
he
heard
of
madame
husson
s
pitiable
condition
and
he
was
able
before
his
own
marriage
to
get
her
an
appointment
as
to
madame
mere
the
emperor
s
mother
but
in
spite
of
that
powerful
protection
clapart
was
never
promoted
his
incapacity
was
too
apparent
ruined
in
by
the
fall
of
the
empire
the
brilliant
aspasia
of
the
directory
had
no
other
resources
than
clapart
s
salary
of
twelve
hundred
francs
from
a
clerkship
obtained
for
him
through
the
comte
de
serizy
moreau
the
only
protector
of
a
woman
whom
he
had
known
in
possession
of
millions
obtained
a
for
her
son
oscar
husson
at
the
school
of
henri
iv
and
he
sent
her
regularly
by
pierrotin
such
supplies
from
the
estate
at
presles
as
he
could
decently
offer
to
a
household
in
distress
oscar
was
the
whole
life
and
all
the
future
of
his
mother
the
poor
woman
could
now
be
reproached
with
no
other
fault
than
her
exaggerated
tenderness
for
her
boy
the
of
his
oscar
was
unfortunately
endowed
by
nature
with
a
foolishness
his
mother
did
not
perceive
in
spite
of
the
s
sarcasms
this
foolishness
or
to
speak
more
specifically
this
overweening
conceit
so
troubled
monsieur
moreau
that
he
begged
madame
clapart
to
send
the
boy
down
to
him
for
a
month
that
he
might
study
his
character
and
find
out
what
career
he
was
fit
for
moreau
was
really
thinking
of
some
day
proposing
oscar
to
the
count
as
his
successor
but
to
give
to
the
devil
and
to
god
what
respectively
belongs
to
them
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
show
the
causes
of
oscar
husson
s
silly
premising
that
he
was
born
in
the
household
of
madame
mere
during
his
early
childhood
his
eyes
were
dazzled
by
imperial
splendors
his
pliant
imagination
retained
the
impression
of
those
gorgeous
scenes
and
nursed
the
images
of
a
golden
time
of
pleasure
in
hopes
of
recovering
them
the
natural
boastfulness
of
possessed
of
a
desire
to
outshine
their
mates
resting
on
these
memories
of
his
childhood
was
developed
in
him
beyond
all
measure
it
may
also
have
been
that
his
mother
at
home
dwelt
too
fondly
on
the
days
when
she
herself
was
a
queen
in
directorial
paris
at
any
rate
oscar
who
was
now
leaving
school
had
been
made
to
bear
many
humiliations
which
the
paying
pupils
put
upon
those
who
hold
scholarships
unless
the
scholars
are
able
to
impose
respect
by
superior
physical
ability
this
mixture
of
former
splendor
now
departed
of
beauty
gone
of
blind
maternal
love
of
sufferings
heroically
borne
made
the
mother
one
of
those
pathetic
figures
which
catch
the
eye
of
many
an
observer
in
paris
incapable
naturally
of
understanding
the
real
attachment
of
moreau
to
this
woman
or
that
of
the
woman
for
the
man
she
had
saved
in
now
her
only
friend
pierrotin
did
not
think
it
best
to
communicate
the
suspicion
that
had
entered
his
head
as
to
some
danger
which
was
threatening
moreau
the
valet
s
speech
we
have
enough
to
do
in
this
world
to
look
after
ourselves
returned
to
his
mind
and
with
it
came
that
sentiment
of
obedience
to
what
he
called
the
chefs
de
file
the
men
in
war
and
men
of
rank
in
peace
besides
just
now
pierrotin
s
head
was
as
full
of
his
own
stings
as
there
are
pieces
in
a
thousand
francs
so
that
the
very
good
madame
certainly
madame
with
which
he
replied
to
the
poor
mother
to
whom
a
trip
of
twenty
miles
appeared
a
journey
showed
plainly
that
he
desired
to
get
away
from
her
useless
and
prolix
instructions
you
will
be
sure
to
place
the
packages
so
that
they
can
not
get
wet
if
the
weather
should
happen
to
i
ve
a
hood
replied
pierrotin
besides
see
madame
with
what
care
they
are
being
oscar
don
t
stay
more
than
two
weeks
no
matter
how
much
they
may
ask
you
continued
madame
clapart
returning
to
her
son
you
can
t
please
madame
moreau
whatever
you
do
besides
you
must
be
home
by
the
end
of
september
we
are
to
go
to
belleville
you
know
to
your
uncle
yes
above
all
she
said
in
a
low
voice
be
sure
never
to
speak
about
servants
keep
thinking
all
the
time
that
madame
moreau
was
once
a
yes
oscar
like
all
youths
whose
vanity
is
excessively
ticklish
seemed
annoyed
at
being
lectured
on
the
threshold
of
the
lion
d
argent
well
now
mamma
we
shall
start
soon
there
s
the
horse
all
the
mother
forgetting
that
she
was
in
the
open
street
embraced
her
oscar
and
said
smiling
as
she
took
a
little
roll
from
her
basket
tiens
you
were
forgetting
your
roll
and
the
chocolate
my
child
once
more
i
repeat
don
t
take
anything
at
the
inns
they
d
make
you
pay
for
the
slightest
thing
ten
times
what
it
is
oscar
would
fain
have
seen
his
mother
farther
off
as
she
stuffed
the
bread
and
chocolate
into
his
pocket
the
scene
had
two
witnesses
two
young
men
a
few
years
older
than
oscar
better
dressed
than
he
without
a
mother
hanging
on
to
them
whose
actions
dress
and
ways
all
betokened
that
complete
independence
which
is
the
one
desire
of
a
lad
still
tied
to
his
mother
s
he
said
cried
one
of
the
laughing
the
words
reached
oscar
s
ears
and
drove
him
to
say
mother
in
a
tone
of
terrible
impatience
let
us
admit
that
madame
clapart
spoke
too
loudly
and
seemed
to
wish
to
show
to
those
around
them
her
tenderness
for
the
boy
what
is
the
matter
with
you
oscar
asked
the
poor
hurt
woman
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
you
she
added
in
a
severe
tone
fancying
herself
able
to
inspire
him
with
respect
a
great
mistake
made
by
those
who
spoil
their
children
listen
my
oscar
she
said
resuming
at
once
her
tender
voice
you
have
a
propensity
to
talk
and
to
tell
all
you
know
and
all
that
you
don
t
know
and
you
do
it
to
show
off
with
the
foolish
vanity
of
a
mere
lad
now
i
repeat
endeavor
to
keep
your
tongue
in
check
you
are
not
sufficiently
advanced
in
life
my
treasure
to
be
able
to
judge
of
the
persons
with
whom
you
may
be
thrown
and
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
to
talk
in
public
conveyances
besides
in
a
diligence
persons
always
keep
the
two
young
men
who
seemed
to
have
walked
to
the
farther
end
of
the
establishment
here
returned
making
their
tap
upon
the
paved
passage
of
the
they
might
have
heard
the
whole
of
this
maternal
homily
so
in
order
to
rid
himself
of
his
mother
oscar
had
recourse
to
an
heroic
measure
which
proved
how
vanity
stimulates
the
intellect
mamma
he
said
you
are
standing
in
a
draught
and
you
may
take
cold
besides
i
am
going
to
get
into
the
the
lad
must
have
touched
some
tender
spot
for
his
mother
caught
him
to
her
bosom
kissed
him
as
if
he
were
starting
upon
a
long
journey
and
went
with
him
to
the
vehicle
with
tears
in
her
eyes
don
t
forget
to
give
five
francs
to
the
servants
when
you
come
away
she
said
write
me
three
times
at
least
during
the
fifteen
days
behave
properly
and
remember
all
that
i
have
told
you
you
have
linen
enough
don
t
send
any
to
the
and
above
all
remember
monsieur
moreau
s
kindness
mind
him
as
you
would
a
father
and
follow
his
as
he
got
into
the
coach
oscar
s
blue
woollen
stockings
became
visible
through
the
action
of
his
trousers
which
drew
up
suddenly
also
the
new
patch
in
the
said
trousers
was
seen
through
the
parting
of
his
the
smiles
of
the
two
young
men
on
whom
these
signs
of
an
honorable
indigence
were
not
lost
were
so
many
fresh
wounds
to
the
lad
s
vanity
the
first
place
was
engaged
for
oscar
said
the
mother
to
pierrotin
take
the
back
seat
she
said
to
the
boy
looking
fondly
at
him
with
a
loving
smile
oh
how
oscar
regretted
that
trouble
and
sorrow
had
destroyed
his
mother
s
beauty
and
that
poverty
and
prevented
her
from
being
better
dressed
one
of
the
young
men
the
one
who
wore
and
spurs
nudged
the
other
to
make
him
take
notice
of
oscar
s
mother
and
the
other
twirled
his
moustache
with
a
gesture
which
signified
rather
pretty
figure
how
shall
i
ever
get
rid
of
mamma
thought
oscar
what
s
the
matter
asked
madame
clapart
oscar
pretended
not
to
hear
the
monster
perhaps
madame
clapart
was
lacking
in
tact
under
the
circumstances
but
all
absorbing
sentiments
have
so
much
egotism
georges
do
you
like
children
when
travelling
asked
one
young
man
of
the
other
yes
my
good
amaury
if
they
are
weaned
and
are
named
oscar
and
have
these
speeches
were
uttered
in
to
allow
oscar
to
hear
them
or
not
hear
them
as
he
chose
his
countenance
was
to
be
the
by
which
the
other
young
traveller
could
judge
how
much
fun
he
might
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
lad
during
the
journey
oscar
chose
not
to
hear
he
looked
to
see
if
his
mother
who
weighed
upon
him
like
a
nightmare
was
still
there
for
he
felt
that
she
loved
him
too
well
to
leave
him
so
quickly
not
only
did
he
involuntarily
compare
the
dress
of
his
travelling
companion
with
his
own
but
he
felt
that
his
mother
s
toilet
counted
for
much
in
the
smiles
of
the
two
young
men
if
they
would
only
take
themselves
off
he
said
to
himself
instead
of
that
amaury
remarked
to
georges
giving
a
tap
with
his
cane
to
the
heavy
wheel
of
the
coucou
and
so
my
friend
you
are
really
going
to
trust
your
future
to
this
fragile
bark
i
must
replied
georges
in
a
tone
of
fatalism
oscar
gave
a
sigh
as
he
remarked
the
jaunty
manner
in
which
his
companion
s
hat
was
stuck
on
one
ear
for
the
purpose
of
showing
a
magnificent
head
of
blond
hair
beautifully
brushed
and
curled
while
he
by
order
of
his
had
his
black
hair
cut
like
a
across
the
forehead
and
clipped
like
a
soldier
s
close
to
the
head
the
face
of
the
vain
lad
was
round
and
chubby
and
bright
with
the
hues
of
health
while
that
of
his
was
long
and
delicate
and
pale
the
forehead
of
the
latter
was
broad
and
his
chest
filled
out
a
waistcoat
of
cashmere
pattern
as
oscar
admired
the
trousers
and
the
overcoat
with
its
frogs
and
olives
clasping
the
waist
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
stranger
gifted
with
such
advantages
insulted
him
by
his
superiority
just
as
an
ugly
woman
feels
injured
by
the
mere
sight
of
a
pretty
one
the
click
of
the
stranger
s
offended
his
taste
and
echoed
in
his
heart
he
felt
as
hampered
by
his
own
clothes
made
no
doubt
at
home
out
of
those
of
his
as
that
envied
young
man
seemed
at
ease
in
his
that
fellow
must
have
heaps
of
francs
in
his
trousers
pocket
thought
oscar
the
young
man
turned
round
what
were
oscar
s
feelings
on
beholding
a
gold
chain
round
his
neck
at
the
end
of
which
no
doubt
was
a
gold
watch
from
that
moment
the
young
man
assumed
in
oscar
s
eyes
the
proportions
of
a
personage
living
in
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
since
taken
to
and
from
school
by
his
oscar
had
no
other
points
of
comparison
since
his
adolescence
than
the
household
of
his
mother
brought
up
strictly
by
moreau
s
advice
he
seldom
went
to
the
theatre
and
then
to
nothing
better
than
the
where
his
eyes
could
see
little
elegance
if
indeed
the
eyes
of
a
child
riveted
on
a
melodrama
were
likely
to
examine
the
audience
his
still
wore
after
the
fashion
of
the
empire
his
watch
in
the
fob
of
his
trousers
from
which
there
depended
over
his
abdomen
a
heavy
gold
chain
ending
in
a
bunch
of
heterogeneous
ornaments
seals
and
a
with
a
round
top
and
flat
sides
on
which
was
a
landscape
in
mosaic
oscar
who
considered
that
finery
as
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
adornment
was
bewildered
by
the
present
revelation
of
superior
and
negligent
elegance
the
young
man
exhibited
offensively
a
pair
of
spotless
gloves
and
seemed
to
wish
to
dazzle
oscar
by
twirling
with
much
grace
a
switch
cane
oscar
had
reached
that
last
quarter
of
adolescence
when
little
things
cause
immense
joys
and
immense
miseries
a
period
when
youth
prefers
misfortune
to
a
ridiculous
suit
of
clothes
and
caring
nothing
for
the
real
interests
of
life
torments
itself
about
frivolities
about
neckcloths
and
the
passionate
desire
to
appear
a
man
then
the
young
fellow
swells
himself
out
his
swagger
is
all
the
more
portentous
because
it
is
exercised
on
nothings
yet
if
he
envies
a
fool
who
is
elegantly
dressed
he
is
also
capable
of
enthusiasm
over
talent
and
of
genuine
admiration
for
genius
such
defects
as
these
when
they
have
no
root
in
the
heart
prove
only
the
exuberance
of
sap
the
richness
of
the
youthful
imagination
that
a
lad
of
nineteen
an
only
child
kept
severely
at
home
by
poverty
adored
by
a
mother
who
put
upon
herself
all
privations
for
his
sake
should
be
moved
to
envy
by
a
young
man
of
in
a
frogged
a
of
fancy
cashmere
and
a
cravat
slipped
through
a
ring
of
the
worse
taste
is
nothing
more
than
a
peccadillo
committed
in
all
ranks
of
social
life
by
inferiors
who
envy
those
that
seem
beyond
them
men
of
genius
themselves
succumb
to
this
primitive
passion
did
not
rousseau
admire
ventura
and
bacle
but
oscar
passed
from
peccadillo
to
evil
feelings
he
felt
humiliated
he
was
angry
with
the
youth
he
envied
and
there
rose
in
his
heart
a
secret
desire
to
show
openly
that
he
himself
was
as
good
as
the
object
of
his
envy
the
two
young
fellows
continued
to
walk
up
and
own
from
the
gate
to
the
stables
and
from
the
stables
to
the
gate
each
time
they
turned
they
looked
at
oscar
curled
up
in
his
corner
of
the
coucou
oscar
persuaded
that
their
jokes
and
laughter
concerned
himself
affected
the
utmost
indifference
he
began
to
hum
the
chorus
of
a
song
lately
brought
into
vogue
by
the
liberals
which
ended
with
the
words
tis
voltaire
s
fault
tis
rousseau
s
tiens
perhaps
he
is
one
of
the
chorus
at
the
opera
said
amaury
this
exasperated
oscar
who
bounded
up
pulled
out
the
wooden
back
and
called
to
pierrotin
when
do
we
start
presently
said
that
functionary
who
was
standing
whip
in
hand
and
gazing
toward
the
rue
d
enghien
at
this
moment
the
scene
was
enlivened
by
the
arrival
of
a
young
man
accompanied
by
a
true
gamin
who
was
followed
by
a
porter
dragging
a
the
young
man
came
up
to
pierrotin
and
spoke
to
him
confidentially
on
which
the
latter
nodded
his
head
and
called
to
his
own
porter
the
man
ran
out
and
helped
to
unload
the
little
which
contained
besides
two
trunks
buckets
brushes
boxes
of
singular
shape
and
an
infinity
of
packages
and
utensils
which
the
youngest
of
the
who
had
climbed
into
the
imperial
stowed
away
with
such
celerity
that
oscar
who
happened
to
be
smiling
at
his
mother
now
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
saw
none
of
the
paraphernalia
which
might
have
revealed
to
him
the
profession
of
his
new
travelling
companion
the
gamin
who
must
have
been
sixteen
years
of
age
wore
a
gray
blouse
buckled
round
his
waist
by
a
polished
leather
belt
his
cap
jauntily
perched
on
the
side
of
his
head
seemed
the
sign
of
a
merry
nature
and
so
did
the
picturesque
disorder
of
the
curly
brown
hair
which
fell
upon
his
shoulders
a
cravat
drew
a
line
round
his
very
white
neck
and
added
to
the
vivacity
of
his
bright
gray
eyes
the
animation
of
his
brown
and
rosy
face
the
moulding
of
his
rather
large
lips
the
ears
detached
from
his
head
his
slightly
nose
in
fact
all
the
details
of
his
face
proclaimed
the
lively
spirit
of
a
figaro
and
the
careless
gayety
of
youth
while
the
vivacity
of
his
gesture
and
his
mocking
eye
revealed
an
intellect
already
developed
by
the
practice
of
a
profession
adopted
very
early
in
life
as
he
had
already
some
claims
to
personal
value
this
child
made
man
by
art
or
by
vocation
seemed
indifferent
to
the
question
of
costume
for
he
looked
at
his
boots
which
had
not
been
polished
with
a
quizzical
air
and
searched
for
the
spots
on
his
brown
holland
trousers
less
to
remove
them
than
to
see
their
effect
i
m
in
style
he
said
giving
himself
a
shake
and
addressing
his
companion
the
glance
of
the
latter
showed
authority
over
his
adept
in
whom
a
practised
eye
would
at
once
have
recognized
the
joyous
pupil
of
a
painter
called
in
the
argot
of
the
studios
a
behave
yourself
mistigris
said
his
master
giving
him
the
nickname
which
the
studio
had
no
doubt
bestowed
upon
him
the
master
was
a
slight
and
pale
young
man
with
extremely
thick
black
hair
worn
in
a
disorder
that
was
actually
fantastic
but
this
abundant
mass
of
hair
seemed
necessary
to
an
enormous
head
whose
vast
forehead
proclaimed
a
precocious
intellect
a
strained
and
harassed
face
too
original
to
be
ugly
was
hollowed
as
if
this
noticeable
young
man
suffered
from
some
chronic
malady
or
from
privations
caused
by
poverty
the
most
terrible
of
all
chronic
maladies
or
from
griefs
too
recent
to
be
forgotten
his
clothing
analogous
with
due
allowance
to
that
of
mistigris
consisted
of
a
shabby
surtout
coat
in
color
much
worn
but
clean
and
a
black
waistcoat
buttoned
to
the
throat
which
almost
concealed
a
scarlet
neckerchief
and
trousers
also
black
and
even
more
worn
than
the
coat
flapping
his
thin
legs
in
addition
a
pair
of
very
muddy
boots
indicated
that
he
had
come
on
foot
and
from
some
distance
to
the
coach
office
with
a
rapid
look
this
artist
seized
the
whole
scene
of
the
lion
d
argent
the
stables
the
courtyard
the
various
lights
and
shades
and
the
details
then
he
looked
at
mistigris
whose
satirical
glance
had
followed
his
own
charming
said
mistigris
yes
very
replied
the
other
we
seem
to
have
got
here
too
early
pursued
mistigris
couldn
t
we
get
a
mouthful
somewhere
my
stomach
like
nature
abhors
a
have
we
time
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
said
the
artist
in
a
gentle
voice
to
pierrotin
yes
but
don
t
be
long
answered
the
latter
good
that
means
we
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
remarked
mistigris
with
the
innate
genius
for
observation
of
the
paris
rapin
the
pair
disappeared
nine
o
clock
was
striking
in
the
hotel
kitchen
georges
thought
it
just
and
reasonable
to
remonstrate
with
pierrotin
hey
my
friend
when
a
man
is
blessed
with
such
wheels
as
these
striking
the
clumsy
tires
with
his
cane
he
ought
at
least
to
have
the
merit
of
punctuality
the
deuce
one
doesn
t
get
into
that
thing
for
pleasure
i
have
business
that
is
devilishly
pressing
or
i
wouldn
t
trust
my
bones
to
it
and
that
horse
which
you
call
rougeot
he
doesn
t
look
likely
to
make
up
for
lost
we
are
going
to
harness
bichette
while
those
gentlemen
take
their
coffee
replied
pierrotin
go
and
ask
you
he
said
to
his
porter
if
pere
leger
is
coming
with
us
where
is
your
pere
leger
asked
georges
over
the
way
at
number
he
couldn
t
get
a
place
in
the
beaumont
diligence
said
pierrotin
still
speaking
to
his
porter
and
apparently
making
no
answer
to
his
customer
then
he
disappeared
himself
in
search
of
bichette
georges
after
shaking
hands
with
his
friend
got
into
the
coach
handling
with
an
air
of
great
importance
a
portfolio
which
he
placed
beneath
the
cushion
of
the
seat
he
took
the
opposite
corner
to
that
of
oscar
on
the
same
seat
this
pere
leger
troubles
me
he
said
they
can
t
take
away
our
places
replied
oscar
i
have
number
and
i
number
two
said
georges
just
as
pierrotin
reappeared
having
harnessed
bichette
the
porter
returned
with
a
stout
man
in
tow
whose
weight
could
not
have
been
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
the
very
least
pere
leger
belonged
to
the
species
of
farmer
which
has
a
square
back
a
protuberant
stomach
a
powdered
pigtail
and
wears
a
little
coat
of
blue
linen
his
white
gaiters
coming
above
the
knee
were
fastened
round
the
ends
of
his
velveteen
breeches
and
secured
by
silver
buckles
his
shoes
weighed
two
pounds
each
in
his
hand
he
held
a
small
reddish
stick
much
polished
with
a
large
knob
which
was
fastened
round
his
wrist
by
a
thong
of
leather
and
you
are
called
pere
leger
asked
georges
very
seriously
as
the
farmer
attempted
to
put
a
foot
on
the
step
at
your
service
replied
the
farmer
looking
in
and
showing
a
face
like
that
of
louis
with
fat
rubicund
cheeks
from
between
which
issued
a
nose
that
in
any
other
face
would
have
seemed
enormous
his
smiling
eyes
were
sunken
in
rolls
of
fat
come
a
helping
hand
my
lad
he
said
to
pierrotin
the
farmer
was
hoisted
in
by
the
united
efforts
of
pierrotin
and
the
porter
to
cries
of
houp
la
hi
ha
hoist
uttered
by
georges
oh
i
m
not
going
far
only
to
la
cave
said
the
farmer
in
france
everybody
takes
a
joke
take
the
back
seat
said
pierrotin
there
ll
be
six
of
where
s
your
other
horse
demanded
georges
is
it
as
mythical
as
the
third
there
she
is
said
pierrotin
pointing
to
the
little
mare
who
was
coming
along
alone
he
calls
that
insect
a
horse
exclaimed
georges
oh
she
s
good
that
little
mare
said
the
farmer
who
by
this
time
was
seated
your
servant
gentlemen
well
pierrotin
how
soon
do
you
start
i
have
two
travellers
in
there
after
a
cup
of
coffee
replied
pierrotin
the
young
man
and
his
page
reappeared
come
let
s
start
was
the
general
cry
we
are
going
to
start
replied
pierrotin
now
then
make
ready
he
said
to
the
porter
who
began
thereupon
to
take
away
the
stones
which
stopped
the
wheels
pierrotin
took
rougeot
by
the
bridle
and
gave
that
guttural
cry
ket
ket
to
tell
the
two
animals
to
collect
their
energy
on
which
though
evidently
stiff
they
pulled
the
coach
to
the
door
of
the
lion
d
argent
after
which
manoeuvre
which
was
purely
preparatory
pierrotin
gazed
up
the
rue
d
enghien
and
then
disappeared
leaving
the
coach
in
charge
of
the
porter
ah
ca
is
he
subject
to
such
attacks
that
master
of
yours
said
mistigris
addressing
the
porter
he
has
gone
to
fetch
his
feed
from
the
stable
replied
the
porter
well
versed
in
all
the
usual
tricks
to
keep
passengers
quiet
well
after
all
said
mistigris
art
is
long
but
life
is
short
to
at
this
particular
epoch
a
fancy
for
mutilating
or
transposing
proverbs
reigned
in
the
studios
it
was
thought
a
triumph
to
find
changes
of
letters
and
sometimes
of
words
which
still
kept
the
semblance
of
the
proverb
while
giving
it
a
fantastic
or
ridiculous
meaning
it
is
plainly
impossible
to
translate
many
of
these
proverbs
and
put
any
fun
or
meaning
into
tr
patience
mistigris
said
his
master
come
wheel
come
pierrotin
here
returned
bringing
with
him
the
comte
de
serizy
who
had
come
through
the
rue
de
l
echiquier
and
with
whom
he
had
doubtless
had
a
short
conversation
pere
leger
said
pierrotin
looking
into
the
coach
will
you
give
your
place
to
monsieur
le
comte
that
will
balance
the
carriage
we
sha
n
t
be
off
for
an
hour
if
you
go
on
this
way
cried
georges
we
shall
have
to
take
down
this
infernal
bar
which
cost
such
trouble
to
put
up
why
should
everybody
be
made
to
move
for
the
man
who
comes
last
we
all
have
a
right
to
the
places
we
took
what

pierrotin
visibly
troubled
i

why
didn

you
keep
better
count
of

said
mistigris
short
counts
make
good
mistigris
behave
yourself
said
his
master
monsieur
de
serizy
was
evidently
taken
by
all
the
persons
in
the
coach
for
a
bourgeois
of
the
name
of
lecomte
don
t
disturb
any
one
he
said
to
pierrotin
i
will
sit
with
you
in
come
mistigris
said
the
master
to
his
rapin
remember
the
respect
you
owe
to
age
you
don
t
know
how
shockingly
old
you
may
be
yourself
some
day
travel
deforms
give
your
place
to
mistigris
opened
the
leathern
curtain
and
jumped
out
with
the
agility
of
a
frog
leaping
into
the
water
you
mustn
t
be
a
rabbit
august
old
man
he
said
to
the
count
mistigris
ars
est
celare
bonum
said
his
master
i
thank
you
very
much
monsieur
said
the
count
to
mistigris
s
master
next
to
whom
he
now
sat
the
minister
of
state
cast
a
sagacious
glance
round
the
interior
of
the
coach
which
greatly
affronted
both
oscar
and
georges
when
persons
want
to
be
master
of
a
coach
they
should
engage
all
the
places
remarked
georges
certain
now
of
his
incognito
the
comte
de
serizy
made
no
reply
to
this
observation
but
assumed
the
air
of
a
bourgeois
suppose
you
were
late
wouldn
t
you
be
glad
that
the
coach
waited
for
you
said
the
farmer
to
the
two
young
men
pierrotin
still
looked
up
and
down
the
street
whip
in
hand
apparently
reluctant
to
mount
to
the
hard
seat
where
mistigris
was
fidgeting
if
you
expect
some
one
else
i
am
not
the
last
said
the
count
i
agree
to
that
reasoning
said
mistigris
georges
and
oscar
began
to
laugh
impertinently
the
old
fellow
doesn
t
know
much
whispered
georges
to
oscar
who
was
delighted
at
this
apparent
union
between
himself
and
the
object
of
his
envy
parbleu
cried
pierrotin
i
shouldn
t
be
sorry
for
two
more
i
haven
t
paid
i
ll
get
out
said
georges
alarmed
what
are
you
waiting
for
pierrotin
asked
pere
leger
whereupon
pierrotin
shouted
a
certain
hi
in
which
bichette
and
rougeot
recognized
a
definitive
resolution
and
they
both
sprang
toward
the
rise
of
the
faubourg
at
a
pace
which
was
soon
to
slacken
the
count
had
a
red
face
of
a
burning
red
all
over
on
which
were
certain
inflamed
portions
which
his
hair
brought
out
into
full
relief
to
any
but
heedless
youths
this
complexion
would
have
revealed
a
constant
inflammation
of
the
blood
produced
by
incessant
labor
these
blotches
and
pimples
so
injured
the
naturally
noble
air
of
the
count
that
careful
examination
was
needed
to
find
in
his
eyes
the
shrewdness
of
the
magistrate
the
wisdom
of
a
statesman
and
the
knowledge
of
a
legislator
his
face
was
flat
and
the
nose
seemed
to
have
been
depressed
into
it
the
hat
hid
the
grace
and
beauty
of
his
forehead
in
short
there
was
enough
to
amuse
those
thoughtless
youths
in
the
odd
contrasts
of
the
silvery
hair
the
burning
face
and
the
thick
tufted
which
were
still
the
count
wore
a
long
blue
overcoat
buttoned
in
military
fashion
to
the
throat
a
white
cravat
around
his
neck
cotton
wool
in
his
ears
and
a
high
enough
to
make
a
large
square
patch
of
white
on
each
cheek
his
black
trousers
covered
his
boots
the
toes
of
which
were
barely
seen
he
wore
no
decoration
in
his
and
doeskin
gloves
concealed
his
hands
nothing
about
him
betrayed
to
the
eyes
of
youth
a
peer
of
france
and
one
of
the
most
useful
statesmen
in
the
kingdom
pere
leger
had
never
seen
the
count
who
on
his
side
knew
the
former
only
by
name
when
the
count
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
cast
the
glance
about
him
which
affronted
georges
and
oscar
he
was
in
reality
looking
for
the
of
his
notary
in
case
he
had
been
forced
like
himself
to
take
pierrotin
s
vehicle
intending
to
caution
him
instantly
about
his
own
incognito
but
feeling
reassured
by
the
appearance
of
oscar
and
that
of
pere
leger
and
above
all
by
the
air
the
waxed
moustaches
and
the
general
look
of
an
adventurer
that
distinguished
georges
he
concluded
that
his
note
had
reached
his
notary
alexandre
crottat
in
time
to
prevent
the
departure
of
the
clerk
pere
leger
said
pierrotin
when
they
reached
the
steep
hill
of
the
faubourg
by
the
rue
de
la
fidelite
suppose
we
get
out
hey
i
ll
get
out
too
said
the
count
hearing
leger
s
name
goodness
if
this
is
how
we
are
going
we
shall
do
fourteen
miles
in
fifteen
days
cried
georges
it
isn
t
my
fault
said
pierrotin
if
a
passenger
wishes
to
get
ten
louis
for
you
if
you
keep
the
secret
of
my
being
here
as
i
told
you
before
said
the
count
in
a
low
voice
taking
pierrotin
by
the
arm
oh
my
thousand
francs
thought
pierrotin
as
he
winked
an
eye
at
monsieur
de
serizy
which
meant
rely
on
oscar
and
georges
stayed
in
the
coach
look
here
pierrotin
since
pierrotin
you
are
cried
georges
when
the
passengers
were
once
more
stowed
away
in
the
vehicle
if
you
don
t
mean
to
go
faster
than
this
say
so
i
ll
pay
my
fare
and
take
a
at
for
i
have
important
business
on
hand
which
can
t
be
oh
he
ll
go
well
enough
said
pere
leger
besides
the
distance
isn
t
i
am
never
more
than
half
an
hour
late
asserted
pierrotin
well
you
are
not
wheeling
the
pope
in
this
old
barrow
of
yours
said
georges
so
get
perhaps
he
s
afraid
of
shaking
monsieur
said
mistigris
looking
round
at
the
count
but
you
shouldn
t
have
preferences
pierrotin
it
isn
t
coucous
and
the
charter
make
all
frenchmen
equals
said
georges
oh
be
easy
said
pere
leger
we
are
sure
to
get
to
la
chapelle
by
la
chapelle
being
the
village
next
beyond
the
barriere
of
chapter
iv
the
grandson
of
the
famous
those
who
travel
in
public
conveyances
know
that
the
persons
thus
united
by
chance
do
not
immediately
have
anything
to
say
to
one
another
unless
under
special
circumstances
conversation
rarely
begins
until
they
have
gone
some
distance
this
period
of
silence
is
employed
as
much
in
mutual
examination
as
in
settling
into
their
places
minds
need
to
get
their
equilibrium
as
much
as
bodies
when
each
person
thinks
he
has
discovered
the
age
profession
and
character
of
his
companions
the
most
talkative
member
of
the
company
begins
and
the
conversation
gets
under
way
with
all
the
more
vivacity
because
those
present
feel
a
need
of
enlivening
the
journey
and
forgetting
its
tedium
that
is
how
things
happen
in
french
in
other
countries
customs
are
very
different
englishmen
pique
themselves
on
never
opening
their
lips
germans
are
melancholy
in
a
vehicle
italians
too
wary
to
talk
spaniards
have
no
public
conveyances
and
russians
no
roads
there
is
no
amusement
except
in
the
lumbering
diligences
of
france
that
gabbling
and
indiscreet
country
where
every
one
is
in
a
hurry
to
laugh
and
show
his
wit
and
where
jest
and
epigram
enliven
all
things
even
the
poverty
of
the
lower
classes
and
the
weightier
cares
of
the
solid
bourgeois
in
a
coach
there
is
no
police
to
check
tongues
and
legislative
assemblies
have
set
the
fashion
of
public
discussion
when
a
young
man
of
like
the
one
named
georges
is
clever
and
lively
he
is
much
tempted
especially
under
circumstances
like
the
present
to
abuse
those
qualities
in
the
first
place
georges
had
soon
decided
that
he
was
the
superior
human
being
of
the
party
there
assembled
he
saw
in
the
count
a
manufacturer
of
the
whom
he
took
for
some
unknown
reason
to
be
a
chandler
in
the
shabby
young
man
accompanied
by
mistigris
a
fellow
of
no
account
in
oscar
a
ninny
and
in
pere
leger
the
fat
farmer
an
excellent
subject
to
hoax
having
thus
looked
over
the
ground
he
resolved
to
amuse
himself
at
the
expense
of
such
companions
let
me
see
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
coucou
went
down
the
hill
from
la
chapelle
to
the
plain
of
shall
i
pass
myself
off
for
etienne
or
beranger
no
these
idiots
don
t
know
who
they
are
carbonaro
the
deuce
i
might
get
myself
arrested
suppose
i
say
i
m
the
son
of
marshal
ney
pooh
what
could
i
tell
them
about
the
execution
of
my
father
it
wouldn
t
be
funny
better
be
a
disguised
russian
prince
and
make
them
swallow
a
lot
of
stuff
about
the
emperor
alexander
or
i
might
be
cousin
and
talk
philosophy
oh
couldn
t
i
perplex
em
but
no
that
shabby
fellow
with
the
tousled
head
looks
to
me
as
if
he
had
jogged
his
way
through
the
sorbonne
what
a
pity
i
can
mimic
an
englishman
so
perfectly
i
might
have
pretended
to
be
lord
byron
travelling
incognito
sapristi
i
ll
command
the
troops
of
ali
pacha
of
janina
during
this
mental
monologue
the
coucou
rolled
through
clouds
of
dust
rising
on
either
side
of
it
from
that
much
travelled
road
what
dust
cried
mistigris
henry
iv
is
dead
retorted
his
master
if
you
d
say
it
was
scented
with
vanilla
that
would
be
emitting
a
new
you
think
you
re
witty
replied
mistigris
well
it
like
vanilla
at
in
the
levant
said
georges
with
the
air
of
beginning
a
story
ex
oriente
flux
remarked
mistigris
s
master
interrupting
the
speaker
i
said
in
the
levant
from
which
i
have
just
returned
continued
georges
the
dust
smells
very
good
but
here
it
smells
of
nothing
except
in
some
old
like
has
monsieur
lately
returned
from
the
levant
said
mistigris
maliciously
he
isn
t
much
tanned
by
the
oh
i
ve
just
left
my
bed
after
an
illness
of
three
months
from
the
germ
so
the
doctors
said
of
suppressed
have
you
had
the
plague
cried
the
count
with
a
gesture
of
alarm
pierrotin
stop
go
on
pierrotin
said
mistigris
didn
t
you
hear
him
say
it
was
inward
his
plague
added
the
rapin
talking
back
to
monsieur
de
serizy
it
isn
t
catching
it
only
comes
out
in
mistigris
if
you
interfere
again
i
ll
have
you
put
off
into
the
road
said
his
master
and
so
he
added
turning
to
georges
monsieur
has
been
to
the
east
yes
monsieur
first
to
egypt
then
to
greece
where
i
served
under
ali
pacha
of
janina
with
whom
i
had
a
terrible
quarrel
there
s
no
enduring
those
climates
long
besides
the
emotions
of
all
kinds
in
oriental
life
have
disorganized
my
what
have
you
served
as
a
soldier
asked
the
fat
farmer
how
old
are
you
replied
georges
whereupon
all
the
passengers
looked
at
him
at
eighteen
i
enlisted
as
a
private
for
the
famous
campaign
of
but
i
was
present
at
only
one
battle
that
of
hanau
where
i
was
promoted
in
france
at
montereau
i
won
the
rank
of
and
was
decorated
by
there
are
no
informers
here
i
m
sure
by
the
what
are
you
decorated
cried
oscar
why
don
t
you
wear
your
cross
the
cross
of
no
thank
you
besides
what
man
of
any
breeding
would
wear
his
decorations
in
travelling
there
s
monsieur
he
said
motioning
to
the
comte
de
serizy
i
ll
bet
whatever
you
like
betting
whatever
you
like
means
in
france
betting
nothing
at
all
said
mistigris
s
master
i
ll
bet
whatever
you
like
repeated
georges
incisively
that
monsieur
here
is
covered
with
well
said
the
count
laughing
i
have
the
grand
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
that
of
saint
andrew
of
russia
that
of
the
prussian
eagle
that
of
the
annunciation
of
sardinia
and
the
golden
beg
pardon
said
mistigris
are
they
all
in
the
coucou
hey
that
old
fellow
goes
it
strong
whispered
georges
to
oscar
what
was
i
saying
oh
i
know
i
don
t
deny
that
i
adore
the
emperor
i
served
under
him
said
the
count
what
a
man
he
was
wasn
t
he
cried
georges
a
man
to
whom
i
owe
many
obligations
replied
the
count
with
a
silly
expression
that
was
admirably
assumed
for
all
those
crosses
inquired
mistigris
and
what
quantities
of
snuff
he
took
continued
monsieur
de
serizy
he
carried
it
loose
in
his
pockets
said
georges
so
i
ve
been
told
remarked
pere
leger
with
an
incredulous
look
worse
than
that
he
chewed
and
smoked
continued
georges
i
saw
him
smoking
in
a
queer
way
too
at
waterloo
when
marshal
soult
took
him
round
the
waist
and
flung
him
into
his
carriage
just
as
he
had
seized
a
musket
and
was
going
to
charge
the
english
you
were
at
waterloo
cried
oscar
his
eyes
stretching
wide
open
yes
young
man
i
did
the
campaign
of
i
was
a
captain
at
and
i
retired
to
the
loire
after
we
were
all
disbanded
faith
i
was
disgusted
with
france
i
couldn
t
stand
it
in
fact
i
should
certainly
have
got
myself
arrested
so
off
i
went
with
two
or
three
dashing
fellows
selves
besson
and
others
who
are
now
in
egypt
and
we
entered
the
service
of
pacha
mohammed
a
queer
sort
of
fellow
he
was
too
once
a
tobacco
merchant
in
the
bazaars
he
is
now
on
the
to
be
a
sovereign
prince
you
ve
all
seen
him
in
that
picture
by
horace
vernet
the
massacre
of
the
what
a
handsome
fellow
he
was
but
i
wouldn
t
give
up
the
religion
of
my
fathers
and
embrace
islamism
all
the
more
because
the
abjuration
required
a
surgical
operation
which
i
hadn
t
any
fancy
for
besides
nobody
respects
a
renegade
now
if
they
had
offered
me
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
perhaps
and
yet
no
the
pacha
did
give
me
a
thousand
talari
as
a
how
much
is
that
asked
oscar
who
was
listening
to
georges
with
all
his
ears
oh
not
much
a
talaro
is
as
you
might
say
a
piece
but
faith
i
got
no
compensation
for
the
vices
i
contracted
in
that
country
if
country
it
is
i
can
t
live
now
without
smoking
a
narghile
twice
and
that
s
very
how
did
you
find
egypt
asked
the
count
egypt
oh
egypt
is
all
sand
replied
georges
by
no
means
taken
aback
there
s
nothing
green
but
the
valley
of
the
nile
draw
a
green
line
down
a
sheet
of
yellow
paper
and
you
have
egypt
but
those
egyptians
fellahs
they
are
called
have
an
immense
advantage
over
us
there
are
no
gendarmes
in
that
country
you
may
go
from
end
to
end
of
egypt
and
you
won
t
see
but
i
suppose
there
are
a
good
many
egyptians
said
mistigris
not
as
many
as
you
think
for
replied
georges
there
are
many
more
abyssinians
and
giaours
and
vechabites
bedouins
and
cophs
but
all
that
kind
of
animal
is
very
uninteresting
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
embark
on
a
genoese
polacca
which
was
loading
for
the
ionian
islands
with
gunpowder
and
munitions
for
ali
de
tebelen
you
know
don
t
you
that
the
british
sell
powder
and
munitions
of
war
to
all
the
world
turks
greeks
and
the
devil
too
if
the
devil
has
money
from
zante
we
were
to
skirt
the
coasts
of
greece
and
tack
about
on
and
off
now
it
happens
that
my
name
of
georges
is
famous
in
that
country
i
am
such
as
you
see
me
the
grandson
of
the
famous
who
made
war
upon
the
porte
and
instead
of
crushing
it
as
he
meant
to
do
got
crushed
himself
his
son
took
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
french
consul
at
smyrna
and
he
afterwards
died
in
paris
leaving
my
mother
pregnant
with
me
his
seventh
child
our
property
was
all
stolen
by
friends
of
my
grandfather
in
fact
we
were
ruined
my
mother
who
lived
on
her
diamonds
which
she
sold
one
by
one
married
in
my
monsieur
yung
a
purveyor
but
my
mother
is
dead
and
i
have
quarrelled
with
my
who
between
ourselves
is
a
blackguard
he
is
still
alive
but
i
never
see
him
that
s
why
in
despair
left
all
to
myself
i
went
off
to
the
wars
as
a
private
in
well
to
go
back
to
the
time
i
returned
to
greece
you
wouldn
t
believe
with
what
joy
old
ali
tebelen
received
the
grandson
of
here
of
course
i
call
myself
simply
georges
the
pacha
gave
me
a
harem
you
have
had
a
harem
said
oscar
were
you
a
pacha
with
tails
asked
mistigris
how
is
it
that
you
don
t
know
replied
georges
that
only
the
sultan
makes
pachas
and
that
my
friend
tebelen
for
we
were
as
friendly
as
bourbons
was
in
rebellion
against
the
padishah
you
know
or
you
don
t
know
that
the
true
title
of
the
grand
seignior
is
padishah
and
not
sultan
or
grand
turk
you
needn
t
think
that
a
harem
is
much
of
a
thing
you
might
as
well
have
a
herd
of
goats
the
women
are
horribly
stupid
down
there
i
much
prefer
the
grisettes
of
the
chaumieres
at
they
are
nearer
at
any
rate
said
the
count
the
women
of
the
harem
couldn
t
speak
a
word
of
french
and
that
language
is
indispensable
for
talking
ali
gave
me
five
legitimate
wives
and
ten
slaves
that
s
equivalent
to
having
none
at
all
at
janina
in
the
east
you
must
know
it
is
thought
very
bad
style
to
have
wives
and
women
they
have
them
just
as
we
have
voltaire
and
rousseau
but
who
ever
opens
his
voltaire
or
his
rousseau
nobody
but
for
all
that
the
highest
style
is
to
be
jealous
they
sew
a
woman
up
in
a
sack
and
fling
her
into
the
water
on
the
slightest
suspicion
that
s
according
to
their
did
you
fling
any
in
asked
the
farmer
i
a
frenchman
for
shame
i
loved
whereupon
georges
twirled
and
twisted
his
moustache
with
a
dreamy
air
they
were
now
entering
and
pierrotin
presently
drew
up
before
the
door
of
a
tavern
where
were
sold
the
famous
of
that
place
all
the
travellers
got
out
puzzled
by
the
apparent
truth
mingled
with
georges
inventions
the
count
returned
to
the
coucou
when
the
others
had
entered
the
house
and
looked
beneath
the
cushion
for
the
portfolio
which
pierrotin
told
him
that
enigmatical
youth
had
placed
there
on
it
he
read
the
words
in
gilt
letters
maitre
crottat
the
count
at
once
opened
it
and
fearing
with
some
reason
that
pere
leger
might
be
seized
with
the
same
curiosity
he
took
out
the
deed
of
sale
for
the
farm
at
moulineaux
put
it
into
his
coat
pocket
and
entered
the
inn
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
travellers
this
georges
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
crottat
s
second
clerk
thought
he
i
shall
pay
my
compliments
to
his
master
whose
business
it
was
to
send
me
his
from
the
respectful
glances
of
pere
leger
and
oscar
georges
perceived
that
he
had
made
for
himself
two
fervent
admirers
accordingly
he
now
posed
as
a
great
personage
paid
for
their
and
ordered
for
each
a
glass
of
alicante
he
offered
the
same
to
mistigris
and
his
master
who
refused
with
smiles
but
the
friend
of
ali
tebelen
profited
by
the
occasion
to
ask
the
pair
their
names
oh
monsieur
said
mistigris
master
i
am
not
blessed
like
you
with
an
illustrious
name
and
i
have
not
returned
from
asia
at
this
moment
the
count
hastening
into
the
huge
lest
his
absence
should
excite
inquiry
entered
the
place
in
time
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
young
man
s
speech
i
am
only
a
poor
painter
lately
returned
from
rome
where
i
went
at
the
cost
of
the
government
after
winning
the
grand
prix
five
years
ago
my
name
is
hey
bourgeois
may
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
alicante
and
some
said
georges
to
the
count
thank
you
replied
the
latter
i
never
leave
home
without
taking
my
cup
of
coffee
and
don
t
you
eat
anything
between
meals
how
bourgeois
marais
place
royale
that
is
cried
georges
when
he
blagued
just
now
about
his
crosses
i
thought
there
was
something
in
him
whispered
the
eastern
hero
to
the
painter
however
we
ll
set
him
going
on
his
decorations
the
old
come
my
lad
he
added
calling
to
oscar
drink
me
down
the
glass
poured
out
for
the
chandler
that
will
start
your
oscar
anxious
to
play
the
man
swallowed
the
second
glass
of
wine
and
ate
three
more
good
wine
that
said
pere
leger
smacking
his
lips
it
is
all
the
better
said
georges
because
it
comes
from
bercy
i
ve
been
to
alicante
myself
and
i
know
that
this
wine
no
more
resembles
what
is
made
there
than
my
arm
is
like
a
windmill
our
wines
are
a
great
deal
better
than
the
natural
ones
in
their
own
country
come
pierrotin
take
a
glass
it
is
a
great
pity
your
horses
can
t
take
one
too
we
might
go
forward
march
cried
pierrotin
amid
a
mighty
cracking
of
whips
after
the
travellers
were
again
boxed
up
it
was
now
eleven
o
clock
the
weather
which
had
been
cloudy
cleared
the
breeze
swept
off
the
mists
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
appeared
in
spots
so
that
when
the
coucou
trundled
along
the
narrow
strip
of
road
from
to
pierrefitte
the
sun
had
fairly
drunk
up
the
last
floating
vapors
of
the
diaphanous
veil
which
swathed
the
scenery
of
that
famous
region
well
now
tell
us
why
you
left
your
friend
the
pacha
said
pere
leger
addressing
georges
he
was
a
very
singular
scamp
replied
georges
with
an
air
that
hid
a
multitude
of
mysteries
he
put
me
in
command
of
his
cavalry
so
far
so
good
ah
that
s
why
he
wears
spurs
thought
poor
oscar
at
that
time
ali
tebelen
wanted
to
rid
himself
of
chosrew
pacha
another
queer
chap
you
call
him
here
chaureff
but
the
name
is
pronounced
in
turkish
cosserew
you
must
have
read
in
the
newspapers
how
old
ali
drubbed
chosrew
and
soundly
too
faith
well
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
ali
tebelen
himself
would
have
bit
the
dust
two
days
earlier
i
was
at
the
right
wing
and
i
saw
chosrew
an
old
thinking
to
force
our
centre
ranks
closed
stiff
swift
fine
movement
a
la
murat
good
i
take
my
time
then
i
charge
and
cut
his
line
in
two
you
understand
ha
ha
after
the
affair
was
over
ali
kissed
me
do
they
do
that
in
the
east
asked
the
count
in
a
joking
way
yes
monsieur
said
the
painter
that
s
done
all
the
world
after
that
continued
georges
ali
gave
me
yataghans
and
carbines
and
scimetars
and
but
when
we
got
back
to
his
capital
he
made
me
propositions
wanted
me
to
drown
a
wife
and
make
a
slave
of
myself
orientals
are
so
queer
but
i
thought
i
d
had
enough
of
it
for
after
all
you
know
ali
was
a
rebel
against
the
porte
so
i
concluded
i
had
better
get
off
while
i
could
but
i
ll
do
monsieur
tebelen
the
justice
to
say
that
he
loaded
me
with
presents
diamonds
ten
thousand
talari
one
thousand
gold
coins
a
beautiful
greek
girl
for
groom
a
little
circassian
for
a
mistress
and
an
arab
horse
yes
ali
tebelen
pacha
of
janina
is
too
little
known
he
needs
an
historian
it
is
only
in
the
east
one
meets
with
such
iron
souls
who
can
nurse
a
vengeance
twenty
years
and
accomplish
it
some
fine
morning
he
had
the
most
magnificent
white
beard
that
was
ever
seen
and
a
hard
stern
face
but
what
did
you
do
with
your
treasures
asked
farmer
leger
ha
that
s
it
you
may
well
ask
that
those
fellows
down
there
haven
t
any
grand
livre
nor
any
bank
of
france
so
i
was
forced
to
carry
off
my
windfalls
in
a
felucca
which
was
captured
by
the
turkish
himself
such
as
you
see
me
here
i
came
very
near
being
impaled
at
smyrna
indeed
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
monsieur
de
riviere
our
ambassador
who
was
there
they
d
have
taken
me
for
an
accomplice
of
ali
pacha
i
saved
my
head
but
to
tell
the
honest
truth
all
the
rest
the
ten
thousand
talari
the
thousand
gold
pieces
and
the
fine
weapons
were
all
yes
all
drunk
up
by
the
thirsty
treasury
of
the
turkish
admiral
my
position
was
the
more
perilous
because
that
very
admiral
happened
to
be
chosrew
pacha
after
i
routed
him
the
fellow
had
managed
to
obtain
a
position
which
is
equal
to
that
of
our
admiral
of
the
fleet
but
i
thought
he
was
in
the
cavalry
said
pere
leger
who
had
followed
the
narrative
with
the
deepest
attention
dear
me
how
little
the
east
is
understood
in
the
french
provinces
cried
georges
monsieur
i
ll
explain
the
turks
to
you
you
are
a
farmer
the
padishah
that
s
the
sultan
makes
you
a
marshal
if
you
don
t
fulfil
your
functions
to
his
satisfaction
so
much
the
worse
for
you
he
cuts
your
head
off
that
s
his
way
of
dismissing
his
functionaries
a
gardener
is
made
a
prefect
and
the
prime
minister
comes
down
to
be
a
the
ottomans
have
no
system
of
promotion
and
no
hierarchy
from
a
cavalry
officer
chosrew
simply
became
a
naval
officer
sultan
mahmoud
ordered
him
to
capture
ali
by
sea
and
he
did
get
hold
of
him
assisted
by
those
beggarly
english
who
put
their
paw
on
most
of
the
treasure
this
chosrew
who
had
not
forgotten
the
i
gave
him
recognized
me
you
understand
my
goose
was
cooked
oh
brown
when
it
suddenly
came
into
my
head
to
claim
protection
as
a
frenchman
and
a
troubadour
from
monsieur
de
riviere
the
ambassador
enchanted
to
find
something
to
show
him
off
demanded
that
i
should
be
set
at
liberty
the
turks
have
one
good
trait
in
their
nature
they
are
as
willing
to
let
you
go
as
they
are
to
cut
your
head
off
they
are
indifferent
to
everything
the
french
consul
charming
fellow
friend
of
chosrew
made
him
give
back
two
thousand
of
the
talari
and
consequently
his
name
is
as
i
may
say
graven
on
my
heart
what
was
his
name
asked
monsieur
de
serizy
and
a
look
of
some
surprise
passed
over
his
face
as
georges
named
correctly
one
of
our
most
distinguished
who
happened
at
that
time
to
be
stationed
at
smyrna
i
assisted
added
georges
at
the
execution
of
the
governor
of
smyrna
whom
the
sultan
had
ordered
chosrew
to
put
to
death
it
was
one
of
the
most
curious
things
i
ever
saw
though
i
ve
seen
many
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
when
we
stop
for
breakfast
from
smyrna
i
crossed
to
spain
hearing
there
was
a
revolution
there
i
went
straight
to
mina
who
appointed
me
as
his
with
the
rank
of
colonel
i
fought
for
the
constitutional
cause
which
will
certainly
be
defeated
when
we
enter
spain
as
we
undoubtedly
shall
some
of
these
days
you
a
french
soldier
said
the
count
sternly
you
show
extraordinary
confidence
in
the
discretion
of
those
who
are
listening
to
but
there
are
no
spies
here
said
georges
are
you
aware
colonel
georges
continued
the
count
that
the
court
of
peers
is
at
this
very
time
inquiring
into
a
conspiracy
which
has
made
the
government
extremely
severe
in
its
treatment
of
french
soldiers
who
bear
arms
against
france
and
who
deal
in
foreign
intrigues
for
the
purpose
of
overthrowing
our
legitimate
on
hearing
this
stern
admonition
the
painter
turned
red
to
his
ears
and
looked
at
mistigris
who
seemed
dumfounded
well
said
pere
leger
what
next
if
continued
the
count
i
were
a
magistrate
it
would
be
my
duty
to
order
the
gendarmes
at
pierrefitte
to
arrest
the
of
mina
and
to
summon
all
present
in
this
vehicle
to
testify
to
his
this
speech
stopped
georges
narrative
all
the
more
surely
because
at
this
moment
the
coucou
reached
the
of
a
brigade
of
gendarmerie
the
white
flag
floating
as
the
orthodox
saying
is
upon
the
breeze
you
have
too
many
decorations
to
do
such
a
dastardly
thing
said
oscar
never
mind
we
ll
catch
up
with
him
soon
whispered
georges
in
the
lad
s
ear
colonel
cried
leger
who
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
the
count
s
outburst
and
wanted
to
change
the
conversation
in
all
these
countries
where
you
have
been
what
sort
of
farming
do
they
do
how
do
they
vary
the
crops
well
in
the
first
place
my
good
fellow
you
must
understand
they
are
too
busy
cropping
off
each
others
heads
to
think
much
of
cropping
the
the
count
couldn
t
help
smiling
and
that
smile
reassured
the
narrator
they
have
a
way
of
cultivating
which
you
will
think
very
queer
they
don
t
cultivate
at
all
that
s
their
style
of
farming
the
turks
and
the
greeks
they
eat
onions
or
rise
they
get
opium
from
poppies
and
it
gives
them
a
fine
revenue
then
they
have
tobacco
which
grows
of
itself
famous
latakiah
and
dates
and
all
kinds
of
sweet
things
that
don
t
need
cultivation
it
is
a
country
full
of
resources
and
commerce
they
make
fine
rugs
at
smyrna
and
not
but
persisted
leger
if
the
rugs
are
made
of
wool
they
must
come
from
sheep
and
to
have
sheep
you
must
have
fields
farms
culture
well
there
may
be
something
of
that
sort
replied
georges
but
their
chief
crop
rice
grows
in
the
water
as
for
me
i
have
only
been
along
the
coasts
and
seen
the
parts
that
are
devastated
by
war
besides
i
have
the
deepest
aversion
to
how
about
the
taxes
asked
the
farmer
oh
the
taxes
are
heavy
they
take
all
a
man
has
and
leave
him
the
rest
the
pacha
of
egypt
was
so
struck
with
the
advantages
of
that
system
that
when
i
came
away
he
was
on
the
point
of
organizing
his
own
administration
on
that
footing
but
said
leger
who
no
longer
understood
a
single
word
how
how
said
georges
why
agents
go
round
and
take
all
the
harvests
and
leave
the
fellahs
just
enough
to
live
on
that
s
a
system
that
does
away
with
stamped
papers
and
bureaucracy
the
curse
of
france
hein
by
virtue
of
what
right
said
leger
right
why
it
is
a
land
of
despotism
they
haven
t
any
rights
don
t
you
know
the
fine
definition
montesquieu
gives
of
despotism
like
the
savage
it
cuts
down
the
tree
to
gather
the
they
don
t
tax
they
take
and
that
s
what
our
rulers
are
trying
to
bring
us
to
tax
vobiscum
no
thank
you
said
mistigris
but
that
is
what
we
coming
to
said
the
count
therefore
those
who
own
land
will
do
well
to
sell
it
monsieur
schinner
must
have
seen
how
things
are
tending
in
italy
where
the
taxes
are
corpo
di
bacco
the
pope
is
laying
it
on
heavily
replied
schinner
but
the
people
are
used
to
it
besides
italians
are
so
that
if
you
let
em
murder
a
few
travellers
along
the
highways
they
re
i
see
monsieur
schinner
said
the
count
that
you
are
not
wearing
the
decoration
you
obtained
in
it
seems
the
fashion
nowadays
not
to
wear
mistigris
and
the
pretended
schinner
blushed
to
their
ears
well
with
me
said
the
artist
the
case
is
different
it
isn
t
on
account
of
fashion
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
recognized
have
the
goodness
not
to
betray
me
monsieur
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
little
painter
of
no
consequence
a
mere
decorator
i
m
on
may
way
to
a
chateau
where
i
mustn
t
rouse
the
slightest
ah
i
see
said
the
count
some
intrigue
a
love
affair
youth
is
happy
oscar
who
was
writhing
in
his
skin
at
being
a
nobody
and
having
nothing
to
say
gazed
at
colonel
and
at
the
famous
painter
schinner
and
wondered
how
he
could
transform
himself
into
somebody
but
a
youth
of
nineteen
kept
at
home
all
his
life
and
going
for
two
weeks
only
into
the
country
what
could
he
be
or
do
or
say
however
the
alicante
had
got
into
his
head
and
his
vanity
was
boiling
in
his
veins
so
when
the
famous
schinner
allowed
a
romantic
adventure
to
be
guessed
at
in
which
the
danger
seemed
as
great
as
the
pleasure
he
fastened
his
eyes
sparkling
with
wrath
and
envy
upon
that
hero
yes
said
the
count
with
a
credulous
air
a
man
must
love
a
woman
well
to
make
such
what
sacrifices
demanded
mistigris
don
t
you
know
my
little
friend
that
a
ceiling
painted
by
so
great
a
master
as
yours
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
replied
the
count
if
the
civil
list
paid
you
as
it
did
thirty
thousand
francs
for
each
of
those
rooms
in
the
louvre
he
continued
addressing
schinner
a
bourgeois
as
you
call
us
in
the
studios
ought
certainly
to
pay
you
twenty
thousand
whereas
if
you
go
to
this
chateau
as
a
humble
decorator
you
will
not
get
two
the
money
is
not
the
greatest
loss
said
mistigris
the
work
is
sure
to
be
a
masterpiece
but
he
can
t
sign
it
you
know
for
fear
of
compromising
ah
i
d
return
all
my
crosses
to
the
sovereigns
who
gave
them
to
me
for
the
devotion
that
youth
can
win
said
the
count
that
s
just
it
said
mistigris
when
one
s
young
one
s
loved
plenty
of
love
plenty
of
women
but
they
do
say
where
there
s
wife
there
s
what
does
madame
schinner
say
to
all
this
pursued
the
count
for
i
believe
you
married
out
of
love
the
beautiful
adelaide
de
rouville
the
protegee
of
old
admiral
de
kergarouet
who
by
the
bye
obtained
for
you
the
order
for
the
louvre
ceilings
through
his
nephew
the
comte
de
a
great
painter
is
never
married
when
he
travels
said
mistigris
so
that
s
the
morality
of
studios
is
it
cried
the
count
with
an
air
of
great
simplicity
is
the
morality
of
courts
where
you
got
those
decorations
of
yours
any
better
said
schinner
recovering
his
upset
for
the
moment
by
finding
out
how
much
the
count
knew
of
schinner
s
life
as
an
artist
i
never
asked
for
any
of
my
orders
said
the
count
i
believe
i
have
loyally
earned
a
fair
yield
and
no
flavor
said
mistigris
the
count
was
resolved
not
to
betray
himself
he
assumed
an
air
of
interest
in
the
country
and
looked
up
the
valley
of
groslay
as
the
coucou
took
the
road
to
leaving
that
to
chantilly
on
the
right
is
rome
as
fine
as
they
say
it
is
said
georges
addressing
the
great
painter
rome
is
fine
only
to
those
who
love
it
a
man
must
have
a
passion
for
it
to
enjoy
it
as
a
city
i
prefer
venice
though
i
just
missed
being
murdered
faith
yes
cried
mistigris
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
you
d
have
been
gobbled
up
it
was
that
lord
byron
who
got
you
into
the
scrape
oh
wasn
t
he
raging
that
buffoon
of
an
englishman
hush
said
schinner
i
don
t
want
my
affair
with
lord
byron
talked
but
you
must
own
all
the
same
that
you
were
glad
enough
i
knew
how
to
box
said
mistigris
from
time
to
time
pierrotin
exchanged
sly
glances
with
the
count
which
might
have
made
less
inexperienced
persons
than
the
five
other
travellers
uneasy
lords
pachas
and
ceilings
he
cried
i
seem
to
be
driving
sovereigns
what
pourboires
i
ll
get
and
all
the
places
paid
for
said
mistigris
slyly
it
is
a
lucky
day
for
me
continued
pierrotin
for
you
know
pere
leger
about
my
beautiful
new
coach
on
which
i
have
paid
an
advance
of
two
thousand
francs
well
those
dogs
of
to
whom
i
have
to
pay
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
more
won
t
take
fifteen
hundred
down
and
my
note
for
a
thousand
for
two
months
those
vultures
want
it
all
who
ever
heard
of
being
so
stiff
with
a
man
in
business
these
eight
years
and
the
father
of
a
family
making
me
run
the
risk
of
losing
everything
carriage
and
money
too
if
i
can
t
find
before
night
that
miserable
last
thousand
hue
bichette
they
won
t
play
that
trick
on
the
great
coach
offices
i
ll
warrant
yes
that
s
it
said
the
rapin
your
money
or
your
well
you
have
only
eight
hundred
now
to
get
remarked
the
count
who
considered
this
moan
addressed
to
pere
leger
a
sort
of
letter
of
credit
drawn
upon
himself
true
said
pierrotin
xi
xi
rougeot
you
must
have
seen
many
fine
ceilings
in
venice
resumed
the
count
addressing
schinner
i
was
too
much
in
love
to
take
any
notice
of
what
seemed
to
me
then
mere
trifles
replied
schinner
but
i
was
soon
cured
of
that
folly
for
it
was
in
the
venetian
states
in
dalmatia
that
i
received
a
cruel
can
it
be
told
asked
georges
i
know
dalmatia
very
well
if
you
have
been
there
you
know
that
all
the
people
at
that
end
of
the
adriatic
are
pirates
rovers
corsairs
retired
from
business
as
they
haven
t
been
hanged
uscoques
said
georges
hearing
the
right
name
given
the
count
who
had
been
sent
by
napoleon
on
one
occasion
to
the
illyrian
provinces
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
georges
so
surprised
was
he
the
affair
happened
in
that
town
where
they
make
maraschino
continued
schinner
seeming
to
search
for
a
name
zara
said
georges
i
ve
been
there
it
is
on
the
you
are
right
said
the
painter
i
had
gone
there
to
look
at
the
country
for
i
adore
scenery
i
ve
longed
a
score
of
times
to
paint
landscape
which
no
one
as
i
think
understands
but
mistigris
who
will
some
day
reproduce
hobbema
ruysdael
claude
lorrain
poussin
and
but
exclaimed
the
count
if
he
reproduces
one
of
them
won
t
that
be
enough
if
you
persist
in
interrupting
monsieur
said
oscar
we
shall
never
get
and
monsieur
schinner
was
not
addressing
himself
to
you
in
particular
added
georges
tisn
t
polite
to
interrupt
said
mistigris
sententiously
but
we
all
do
it
and
conversation
would
lose
a
great
deal
if
we
didn
t
scatter
little
condiments
while
exchanging
our
reflections
therefore
continue
agreeable
old
gentleman
to
lecture
us
if
you
like
it
is
done
in
the
best
society
and
you
know
the
proverb
we
must
owl
with
the
i
had
heard
marvellous
things
of
dalmatia
resumed
schinner
so
i
went
there
leaving
mistigris
in
venice
at
an
inn
locanda
interposed
mistigris
keep
to
the
local
zara
is
what
is
called
a
country
town
yes
said
georges
but
it
is
parbleu
said
schinner
the
fortifications
count
for
much
in
my
adventure
at
zara
there
are
a
great
many
apothecaries
i
lodged
with
one
in
foreign
countries
everybody
makes
a
principal
business
of
letting
lodgings
all
other
trades
are
accessory
in
the
evening
linen
changed
i
sat
in
my
balcony
in
the
opposite
balcony
i
saw
a
woman
oh
such
a
woman
greek
tells
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
town
almond
eyes
lids
that
dropped
like
curtains
lashes
like
a
a
face
with
an
oval
to
drive
raffaelle
mad
a
skin
of
the
most
delicious
coloring
tints
velvety
and
hands
oh
they
weren
t
made
of
butter
like
those
of
the
david
school
put
in
mistigris
you
are
always
lugging
in
your
painting
cried
georges
la
la
retorted
mistigris
an
ounce
o
paint
is
worth
a
pound
of
and
such
a
costume
pure
greek
continued
schinner
conflagration
of
soul
you
understand
well
i
questioned
my
diafoirus
and
he
told
me
that
my
neighbor
was
named
zena
changed
my
linen
the
husband
an
old
villain
in
order
to
marry
zena
paid
three
hundred
thousand
francs
to
her
father
and
mother
so
celebrated
was
the
beauty
of
that
beautiful
creature
who
was
truly
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
all
dalmatia
illyria
adriatica
and
other
places
in
those
parts
they
buy
their
wives
without
seeing
them
i
shall
not
go
said
pere
leger
there
are
nights
when
my
sleep
is
still
illuminated
by
the
eyes
of
zena
continued
schinner
the
husband
was
years
of
age
and
jealous
not
as
a
tiger
for
they
say
of
a
tiger
jealous
as
a
dalmatian
and
my
man
was
worse
than
a
dalmatian
one
dalmatian
he
was
three
and
a
half
dalmatians
at
the
very
least
he
was
an
uscoque
tricoque
archicoque
in
a
bicoque
of
a
paltry
little
place
like
zara
horrid
fellow
and
horrider
bellow
put
in
mistigris
ha
good
said
georges
laughing
after
being
a
corsair
and
probably
a
pirate
he
thought
no
more
of
spitting
a
christian
on
his
dagger
than
i
did
of
spitting
on
the
ground
continued
schinner
so
that
was
how
the
land
lay
the
old
wretch
had
millions
and
was
hideous
with
the
loss
of
an
ear
some
pacha
had
cut
off
and
the
want
of
an
eye
left
i
don
t
know
where
never
said
the
little
diafoirus
never
does
he
leave
his
wife
never
for
a
perhaps
she
ll
want
your
services
and
i
could
go
in
your
clothes
that
s
a
trick
that
has
great
success
in
our
theatres
i
told
him
well
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
all
the
delicious
moments
of
that
lifetime
to
wit
three
days
which
i
passed
exchanging
looks
with
zena
and
changing
linen
every
day
it
was
all
the
more
violently
titillating
because
the
slightest
motion
was
significant
and
dangerous
at
last
it
must
have
dawned
upon
zena
s
mind
that
none
but
a
frenchman
and
an
artist
was
daring
enough
to
make
eyes
at
her
in
the
midst
of
the
perils
by
which
she
was
surrounded
and
as
she
hated
her
hideous
pirate
she
answered
my
glances
with
delightful
ogles
fit
to
raise
a
man
to
the
summit
of
paradise
without
pulleys
i
attained
to
the
height
of
don
quixote
i
rose
to
exaltation
and
i
cried
the
monster
may
kill
me
but
i
ll
go
i
ll
go
i
gave
up
landscape
and
studied
the
ignoble
dwelling
of
the
uscoque
that
night
changed
linen
and
put
on
the
most
perfumed
shirt
i
had
then
i
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
house
cried
oscar
the
house
echoed
georges
the
house
said
schinner
well
you
re
a
bold
dog
cried
farmer
leger
i
should
have
kept
out
of
it
especially
as
you
could
never
have
got
through
the
doorway
replied
schinner
so
in
i
went
he
resumed
and
i
found
two
hands
stretched
out
to
meet
mine
i
said
nothing
for
those
hands
soft
as
the
peel
of
an
onion
enjoined
me
to
silence
a
whisper
breathed
into
my
ear
he
sleeps
then
as
we
were
sure
that
nobody
would
see
us
we
went
to
walk
zena
and
i
upon
the
ramparts
but
accompanied
if
you
please
by
a
duenna
as
hideous
as
an
old
portress
who
didn
t
leave
us
any
more
than
our
shadow
and
i
couldn
t
persuade
madame
pirate
to
send
her
away
the
next
night
we
did
the
same
thing
and
again
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
old
woman
but
zena
resisted
as
my
sweet
love
spoke
only
greek
and
i
venetian
we
couldn
t
understand
each
other
and
so
we
quarrelled
i
said
to
myself
in
changing
linen
as
sure
as
fate
the
next
time
there
ll
be
no
old
woman
and
we
can
make
it
all
up
with
the
language
of
instead
of
which
fate
willed
that
that
old
woman
should
save
my
life
you
ll
hear
how
the
weather
was
fine
and
not
to
create
suspicion
i
took
a
turn
at
landscape
this
was
after
our
quarrel
was
made
up
you
understand
after
walking
along
the
ramparts
for
some
time
i
was
coming
tranquilly
home
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
when
i
saw
the
street
crowded
with
people
such
a
crowd
like
that
for
an
execution
it
fell
upon
me
i
was
seized
garroted
gagged
and
guarded
by
the
police
ah
you
don
t
know
and
i
hope
you
never
may
know
what
it
is
to
be
taken
for
a
murderer
by
a
maddened
populace
which
stones
you
and
howls
after
you
from
end
to
end
of
the
principal
street
of
a
town
shouting
for
your
death
ah
those
eyes
were
so
many
flames
all
mouths
were
a
single
curse
while
from
the
volume
of
that
burning
hatred
rose
the
fearful
cry
to
death
to
death
down
with
the
murderer
so
those
dalmatians
spoke
our
language
did
they
said
the
count
i
observe
you
relate
the
scene
as
if
it
happened
schinner
was
nonplussed
riot
has
but
one
language
said
the
astute
statesman
mistigris
well
continued
schinner
when
i
was
brought
into
court
in
presence
of
the
magistrates
i
learned
that
the
cursed
corsair
was
dead
poisoned
by
zena
i
d
liked
to
have
changed
linen
then
give
you
my
word
i
knew
nothing
of
melodrama
it
seems
the
greek
girl
put
opium
a
great
many
poppies
as
monsieur
told
us
grow
about
there
in
the
pirate
s
grog
just
to
make
him
sleep
soundly
and
leave
her
free
for
a
little
walk
with
me
and
the
old
duenna
unfortunate
creature
made
a
mistake
and
trebled
the
dose
the
immense
fortune
of
that
cursed
pirate
was
really
the
cause
of
all
my
zena
s
troubles
but
she
explained
matters
so
ingenuously
that
i
for
one
was
released
with
an
injunction
from
the
mayor
and
the
austrian
commissary
of
police
to
go
back
to
rome
zena
who
let
the
heirs
of
the
uscoque
and
the
judges
get
most
of
the
old
villain
s
wealth
was
let
off
with
two
years
seclusion
in
a
convent
where
she
still
is
i
am
going
back
there
some
day
to
paint
her
portrait
for
in
a
few
years
you
know
all
this
will
be
forgotten
such
are
the
follies
one
commits
at
eighteen
and
you
left
me
without
a
sou
in
the
locanda
at
venice
said
mistigris
and
i
had
to
get
from
venice
to
rome
by
painting
portraits
for
five
francs
apiece
which
they
didn
t
pay
me
however
that
was
my
halcyon
time
i
don
t
regret
you
can
imagine
the
reflections
that
came
to
me
in
that
dalmatian
prison
thrown
there
without
protection
having
to
answer
to
austrians
and
dalmatians
and
in
danger
of
losing
my
head
because
i
went
twice
to
walk
with
a
woman
there
s
with
a
vengeance
did
all
that
really
happen
to
you
said
oscar
naively
why
shouldn
t
it
happen
to
him
inasmuch
as
it
had
already
happened
during
the
french
occupation
of
illyria
to
one
of
our
most
gallant
officers
of
artillery
said
the
count
slyly
and
you
believed
that
artillery
officer
said
mistigris
as
slyly
to
the
count
is
that
all
asked
oscar
of
course
he
can
t
tell
you
that
they
cut
his
head
off
how
could
he
said
mistigris
dead
schinners
tell
no
monsieur
are
there
farms
in
that
country
asked
pere
leger
what
do
they
cultivate
maraschino
replied
mistigris
a
plant
that
grows
to
the
height
of
the
lips
and
produces
a
liqueur
which
goes
by
that
ah
said
pere
leger
i
only
stayed
three
days
in
the
town
and
fifteen
in
prison
said
schinner
so
i
saw
nothing
not
even
the
fields
where
they
grow
the
they
are
fooling
you
said
georges
to
the
farmer
maraschino

chapter
the
drama
begins
pierrotin
s
vehicle
was
now
going
down
the
steep
incline
of
the
valley
of
to
the
inn
which
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
large
village
of
that
name
where
pierrotin
was
in
the
habit
of
stopping
an
hour
to
breathe
his
horses
give
them
their
oats
and
water
them
it
was
now
about
one
o
clock
ha

s
pere

cried
the
when
the
coach
pulled
up
before
the
door
do
you
breakfast
always
once
a
day
said
the
fat
farmer
and
i
ll
break
a
crust
here
and
give
us
a
good
breakfast
cried
georges
twirling
his
cane
in
a
cavalier
manner
which
excited
the
admiration
of
poor
oscar
but
that
admiration
was
turned
to
jealousy
when
he
saw
the
gay
adventurer
pull
out
from
a
a
small
straw
case
from
which
he
selected
a
cigar
which
he
proceeded
to
smoke
on
the
threshold
of
the
inn
door
while
waiting
for
breakfast
do
you
smoke
he
asked
of
oscar
sometimes
replied
the
swelling
out
his
little
chest
and
assuming
a
jaunty
air
georges
presented
the
open
case
to
oscar
and
schinner
phew
said
the
great
painter

the
remains
of
those
i
brought
back
from
spain
said
the
adventurer
do
you
breakfast
here
no
said
the
artist
i
am
expected
at
the
chateau
besides
i
took
something
at
the
lion
d
argent
just
before
and
you
said
georges
to
oscar
i
have
breakfasted
replied
oscar
oscar
would
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
for
boots
and
straps
to
his
trousers
he
sneezed
he
coughed
he
spat
and
swallowed
the
smoke
with
grimaces
you
don
t
know
how
to
smoke
said
schinner
look
at
me
with
a
motionless
face
schinner
breathed
in
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
and
let
it
out
through
his
nose
without
the
slightest
contraction
of
feature
then
he
took
another
whiff
kept
the
smoke
in
his
throat
removed
the
cigar
from
his
lips
and
allowed
the
smoke
slowly
and
gracefully
to
escape
them
there
young
man
said
the
great
painter
here
young
man
here
s
another
way
watch
this
said
georges
imitating
schinner
but
swallowing
the
smoke
and
exhaling
none
and
my
parents
believed
they
had
educated
me
thought
oscar
endeavoring
to
smoke
with
better
grace
but
his
nausea
was
so
strong
that
he
was
thankful
when
mistigris
filched
his
cigar
remarking
as
he
smoked
it
with
evident
satisfaction
you
haven
t
any
contagious
diseases
i
oscar
in
reply
would
fain
have
punched
his
head
how
he
does
spend
money
he
said
looking
at
colonel
georges
eight
francs
for
alicante
and
the
forty
sous
for
cigars
and
his
breakfast
will
cost
him
ten
francs
at
least
replied
mistigris
but
that
s
how
things
are
sharp
stomachs
make
short
come
pere

let
us
drink
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
together
said
georges
to
the
farmer
twenty
francs
for
his
breakfast
cried
oscar
in
all
more
than
francs
since
we
started
killed
by
a
sense
of
his
inferiority
oscar
sat
down
on
a
stone
post
lost
in
a
revery
which
did
not
allow
him
to
perceive
that
his
trousers
drawn
up
by
the
effect
of
his
position
showed
the
point
of
junction
between
the
old
top
of
his
stocking
and
the
new
footing
his
mother
s
handiwork
we
are
brothers
in
socks
said
mistigris
pulling
up
his
own
trousers
sufficiently
to
show
an
effect
of
the
same
kind
by
the
footing
the
count
who
overheard
this
laughed
as
he
stood
with
folded
arms
under
the
a
little
behind
the
other
travellers
however
nonsensical
these
lads
might
be
the
grave
statesman
envied
their
very
follies
he
liked
their
bragging
and
enjoyed
the
fun
of
their
lively
chatter
well
are
you
to
have
les
moulineaux
for
i
know
you
went
to
paris
to
get
the
money
for
the
purchase
said
the
to
pere
leger
whom
he
had
just
taken
to
the
stables
to
see
a
horse
he
wanted
to
sell
to
him
it
will
be
queer
if
you
manage
to
fleece
a
peer
of
france
and
a
minister
of
state
like
the
comte
de
the
person
thus
alluded
to
showed
no
sign
upon
his
face
as
he
turned
to
look
at
the
farmer
i
ve
done
for
him
replied
pere
leger
in
a
low
voice
good
i
like
to
see
those
nobles
fooled
if
you
should
want
twenty
thousand
francs
or
so
i
ll
lend
them
to
you
but
francois
the
conductor
of
touchard
s
six
o
clock
coach
told
me
that
monsieur
margueron
was
invited
by
the
comte
de
serizy
to
dine
with
him
at
that
was
the
plan
of
his
excellency
but
we
had
our
own
little
ways
of
thwarting
it
said
the
farmer
laughing
the
count
could
appoint
monsieur
margueron
s
son
and
you
haven
t
any
place
to
give
remember
that
said
the
of
course
i
do
but
if
the
count
has
the
ministry
on
his
side
i
have
king
louis
said
pere
leger
in
a
low
voice
forty
thousand
of
his
pictures
on
coin
of
the
realm
given
to
moreau
will
enable
me
to
buy
les
moulineaux
for
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
money
down
before
monsieur
de
serizy
can
do
so
when
he
finds
the
sale
is
made
he
ll
be
glad
enough
to
buy
the
farm
for
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
instead
of
letting
me
cut
it
up
in
small
lots
right
in
the
heart
of
his
well
done
bourgeois
cried
the
don
t
you
think
that
s
good
play
said
leger
besides
said
the
the
farm
is
really
worth
that
to
yes
les
moulineaux
brings
in
six
thousand
francs
in
rental
i
ll
take
another
lease
of
it
at
seven
thousand
five
hundred
for
eighteen
years
therefore
it
is
really
an
investment
at
more
than
two
and
a
half
per
cent
the
count
can
t
complain
of
that
in
order
not
to
involve
moreau
he
is
himself
to
propose
me
as
tenant
and
farmer
it
gives
him
a
look
of
acting
for
his
master
s
interests
by
finding
him
nearly
three
per
cent
for
his
money
and
a
tenant
who
will
pay
how
much
will
moreau
make
in
all
well
if
the
count
gives
him
ten
thousand
francs
for
the
transaction
the
matter
will
bring
him
fifty
thousand
and
after
all
the
count
so
they
tell
me
doesn
t
like
presles
and
then
he
is
so
rich
what
does
it
matter
what
it
costs
him
said
the
i
have
never
seen
him
nor
i
said
pere
leger
but
he
must
be
intending
to
live
there
or
why
should
he
spend
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
restoring
the
chateau
it
is
as
fine
now
as
the
king
s
own
well
well
said
the
it
was
high
time
for
moreau
to
feather
his
yes
for
if
the
masters
come
there
replied
leger
they
won
t
keep
their
eyes
in
their
the
count
lost
not
a
word
of
this
conversation
which
was
held
in
a
low
voice
but
not
in
a
whisper
here
i
have
actually
found
the
proofs
i
was
going
down
there
to
seek
he
thought
looking
at
the
fat
farmer
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
but
perhaps
he
added
it
is
only
a
scheme
moreau
may
not
have
listened
to
so
unwilling
was
he
to
believe
that
his
steward
could
lend
himself
to
such
a
conspiracy
pierrotin
here
came
out
to
water
his
horses
the
count
thinking
that
the
driver
would
probably
breakfast
with
the
farmer
and
the
feared
some
thoughtless
indiscretion
all
these
people
combine
against
us
he
thought
it
is
allowable
to
baffle
them
pierrotin
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
the
man
passed
him
i
promised
you
ten
louis
to
keep
my
secret
but
if
you
continue
to
conceal
my
name
and
remember
i
shall
know
if
you
pronounce
it
or
make
the
slightest
sign
that
reveals
it
to
any
one
no
matter
who
here
or
at
before
i
will
give
you
morning
on
your
return
trip
the
thousand
francs
you
need
to
pay
for
your
new
coach
therefore
by
way
of
precaution
added
the
count
striking
pierrotin
who
was
pale
with
happiness
on
the
shoulder
don
t
go
in
there
to
breakfast

with
your
monsieur
le

the
count

said
pierrotin
a
few
moments
later
putting
his
head
into
the
kitchen
we
are

as

along

in

to
the
count
s
surprise
pierrotin
himself
rebridled
the
horses
schinner
and
mistigris
had
walked
on
scarcely
had
pierrotin
overtaken
the
two
artists
and
was
mounting
the
hill
from
which
ecouen
the
steeple
of
mesnil
and
the
forests
that
surround
that
most
beautiful
region
came
in
sight
when
the
gallop
of
a
horse
and
the
jingling
of
a
vehicle
announced
the
coming
of
pere
leger
and
the
grandson
of
who
were
soon
restored
to
their
places
in
the
coucou
as
pierrotin
drove
down
the
narrow
road
to
moisselles
georges
who
had
so
far
not
ceased
to
talk
with
the
farmer
of
the
beauty
of
the
hostess
at
suddenly
exclaimed
upon
my
word
this
landscape
is
not
so
bad
great
painter
is
it
pooh
you
who
have
seen
the
east
and
spain
can
t
really
admire
i
ve
two
cigars
left
if
no
one
objects
will
you
help
me
finish
them
schinner
the
little
young
man
there
seems
to
have
found
a
whiff
or
two
enough
for
pere
leger
and
the
count
kept
silence
which
passed
for
consent
oscar
furious
at
being
called
a
little
young
man
remarked
as
the
other
two
were
lighting
their
cigars
i
am
not
the
of
mina
monsieur
and
i
have
not
yet
been
to
the
east
but
i
shall
probably
go
there
the
career
to
which
my
family
destine
me
will
spare
me
i
trust
the
annoyances
of
travelling
in
a
coucou
before
i
reach
your
present
age
when
i
once
become
a
personage
i
shall
know
how
to
maintain
my
et
caetera
punctum
crowed
mistigris
imitating
the
hoarse
voice
of
a
young
cock
which
made
oscar
s
deliverance
all
the
more
absurd
because
he
had
just
reached
the
age
when
the
beard
sprouts
and
the
voice
breaks
what
a
chit
for
chat
added
the
rapin
your
family
young
man
destine
you
to
some
career
do
they
said
georges
might
i
ask
what
it
is
diplomacy
replied
oscar
three
bursts
of
laughter
came
from
mistigris
the
great
painter
and
the
farmer
the
count
himself
could
not
help
smiling
georges
was
perfectly
grave
by
allah
he
exclaimed
i
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
that
though
it
seems
to
me
young
man
that
your
respectable
mother
is
at
the
present
moment
not
exactly
in
the
social
sphere
of
an
ambassadress
she
carried
a
handbag
worthy
of
the
utmost
respect
and
wore
which
my
mother
monsieur
exclaimed
oscar
in
a
tone
of
indignation
that
was
the
person
in
charge
of
our
our
household
is
a
very
aristocratic
term
remarked
the
count
kings
have
households
replied
oscar
proudly
a
look
from
georges
repressed
the
desire
to
laugh
which
took
possession
of
everybody
he
contrived
to
make
mistigris
and
the
painter
understand
that
it
was
necessary
to
manage
oscar
cleverly
in
order
to
work
this
new
mine
of
amusement
monsieur
is
right
said
the
great
schinner
to
the
count
motioning
towards
oscar
people
always
talk
of
their
households
it
is
only
common
persons
like
ourselves
who
say
for
a
man
so
covered
with
decorations
nunc
my
eye
nunc
alii
whispered
mistigris
you
seem
to
know
little
of
the
language
of
the
courts
i
ask
your
future
protection
excellency
added
schinner
turning
to
oscar
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
travelled
with
three
such
distinguished
men
said
the
count
a
painter
already
famous
a
future
general
and
a
young
diplomatist
who
may
some
day
recover
belgium
for
having
committed
the
odious
crime
of
repudiating
his
mother
oscar
furious
from
a
sense
that
his
companions
were
laughing
at
him
now
resolved
at
any
cost
to
make
them
pay
attention
to
him
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
he
began
his
eyes
flaming
that
s
not
it
said
mistigris
all
is
not
old
that
you
ll
never
get
on
in
diplomacy
if
you
don
t
know
your
proverbs
better
than
i
may
not
know
proverbs
but
i
know
my
way
it
must
be
far
said
georges
for
i
saw
that
person
in
charge
of
your
household
give
you
provisions
enough
for
an
ocean
voyage
rolls
chocolate
a
special
kind
of
bread
and
chocolate
yes
monsieur
returned
oscar
my
stomach
is
much
too
delicate
to
digest
the
victuals
of
a
victuals
is
a
word
as
delicate
and
refined
as
your
stomach
said
georges
ah
i
like
that
word
victuals
cried
the
great
painter
the
word
is
all
the
fashion
in
the
best
society
said
mistigris
i
use
it
myself
at
the
cafe
of
the
black
your
tutor
is
doubtless
some
celebrated
professor
isn
t
he
monsieur
andrieux
of
the
academie
francaise
or
monsieur
asked
schinner
my
tutor
is
or
was
the
abbe
loraux
now
vicar
of
replied
oscar
recollecting
the
name
of
the
confessor
at
his
school
well
you
were
right
to
take
a
private
tutor
said
mistigris
tuto
tutor
celeritus
and
of
course
you
will
reward
him
well
your
abbe
undoubtedly
he
will
be
made
a
bishop
some
day
said
oscar
by
your
family
influence
inquired
georges
gravely
we
shall
probably
contribute
to
his
rise
for
the
abbe
frayssinous
is
constantly
at
our
ah
you
know
the
abbe
frayssinous
asked
the
count
he
is
under
obligations
to
my
father
answered
oscar
are
you
on
your
way
to
your
estate
asked
georges
no
monsieur
but
i
am
able
to
say
where
i
am
going
if
others
are
not
i
am
going
to
the
chateau
de
presles
to
the
comte
de
the
devil
are
you
going
to
presles
cried
schinner
turning
as
red
as
a
cherry
so
you
know
his
excellency
the
comte
de
serizy
said
georges
pere
leger
turned
round
to
look
at
oscar
with
a
stupefied
air
is
monsieur
de
serizy
at
presles
he
said
apparently
as
i
am
going
there
replied
oscar
do
you
often
see
the
count
asked
monsieur
de
serizy
often
replied
oscar
i
am
a
comrade
of
his
son
who
is
about
my
age
nineteen
we
ride
together
on
horseback
nearly
every
aut
caesar
aut
serizy
said
mistigris
sententiously
pierrotin
and
pere
leger
exchanged
winks
on
hearing
this
statement
really
said
the
count
to
oscar
i
am
delighted
to
meet
with
a
young
man
who
can
tell
me
about
that
personage
i
want
his
influence
on
a
rather
serious
matter
although
it
would
cost
him
nothing
to
oblige
me
it
concerns
a
claim
i
wish
to
press
on
the
american
government
i
should
be
glad
to
obtain
information
about
monsieur
de
oh
if
you
want
to
succeed
replied
oscar
with
a
knowing
look
don
t
go
to
him
but
go
to
his
wife
he
is
madly
in
love
with
her
no
one
knows
more
than
i
do
about
that
but
she
can
t
endure
why
not
said
georges
the
count
has
a
skin
disease
which
makes
him
hideous
doctor
albert
has
tried
in
vain
to
cure
it
the
count
would
give
half
his
fortune
if
he
had
a
chest
like
mine
said
oscar
swelling
himself
out
he
lives
a
lonely
life
in
his
own
house
gets
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
works
from
three
to
eight
o
clock
after
eight
he
takes
his
remedies
and
such
things
his
valet
bakes
him
in
a
sort
of
iron
box
for
he
is
always
in
hopes
of
getting
if
he
is
such
a
friend
of
the
king
as
they
say
he
is
why
doesn
t
he
get
his
majesty
to
touch
him
asked
georges
the
count
has
lately
promised
thirty
thousand
francs
to
a
celebrated
scotch
doctor
who
is
coming
over
to
treat
him
continued
oscar
then
his
wife
can
t
be
blamed
if
she
finds
better
said
schinner
but
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
i
should
say
so
resumed
oscar
the
poor
man
is
so
shrivelled
and
old
you
would
take
him
for
eighty
he
s
as
dry
as
parchment
and
unluckily
for
him
he
feels
his
most
men
would
said
pere
leger
he
adores
his
wife
and
dares
not
find
fault
with
her
pursued
oscar
rejoicing
to
have
found
a
topic
to
which
they
listened
he
plays
scenes
with
her
which
would
make
you
die
of
laughing
exactly
like
arnolphe
in
moliere
s
the
count
looked
at
pierrotin
who
finding
that
the
count
said
nothing
concluded
that
madame
clapart
s
son
was
telling
falsehoods
so
monsieur
continued
oscar
if
you
want
the
count
s
influence
i
advise
you
to
apply
to
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
if
you
get
that
former
adorer
of
madame
de
serizy
on
your
side
you
will
win
husband
and
wife
at
one
look
here
said
the
painter
you
seem
to
have
seen
the
count
without
his
clothes
are
you
his
valet
his
valet
cried
oscar
hang
it
people
don
t
tell
such
things
about
their
friends
in
public
conveyances
exclaimed
mistigris
as
for
me
i
m
not
listening
to
you
i
m
deaf
discretion
plays
the
better
part
of
a
poet
is
nasty
and
not
fit
and
so
is
a
cried
schinner
great
painter
said
georges
sententiously
learn
this
you
can
t
say
harm
of
people
you
don
t
know
now
the
little
one
here
has
proved
indubitably
that
he
knows
his
serizy
by
heart
if
he
had
told
us
about
the
countess
perhaps
stop
not
a
word
about
the
comtesse
de
serizy
young
men
cried
the
count
i
am
a
friend
of
her
brother
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
and
whoever
attempts
to
speak
disparagingly
of
the
countess
must
answer
to
monsieur
is
right
cried
the
painter
no
man
should
blaguer
god
honor
and
the
ladies
i
believe
in
that
melodrama
said
mistigris
i
don
t
know
the
guerrilla
chieftain
mina
but
i
know
the
keeper
of
the
seals
continued
the
count
looking
at
georges
and
though
i
don
t
wear
my
decorations
he
added
looking
at
the
painter
i
prevent
those
who
do
not
deserve
them
from
obtaining
any
and
finally
let
me
say
that
i
know
so
many
persons
that
i
even
know
monsieur
grindot
the
architect
of
presles
pierrotin
stop
at
the
next
inn
i
want
to
get
out
a
pierrotin
hurried
his
horses
through
the
village
street
of
moisselles
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
inn
where
all
travellers
stopped
this
short
distance
was
done
in
silence
where
is
that
young
fool
going
asked
the
count
drawing
pierrotin
into
the
to
your
steward
he
is
the
son
of
a
poor
lady
who
lives
in
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
to
whom
i
often
carry
fruit
and
game
and
poultry
from
presles
she
is
a
madame
who
is
that
man
inquired
pere
leger
of
pierrotin
when
the
count
had
left
him
faith
i
don
t
know
replied
pierrotin
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
driven
him
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
he
was
that
prince
who
owns
maffliers
he
has
just
told
me
to
leave
him
on
the
road
near
there
he
doesn
t
want
to
go
on
to
pierrotin
thinks
he
is
the
master
of
maffliers
said
pere
leger
addressing
georges
when
he
got
back
into
the
coach
the
three
young
fellows
were
now
as
dull
as
thieves
caught
in
the
act
they
dared
not
look
at
each
other
and
were
evidently
considering
the
consequences
of
their
fibs
this
is
what
is
called
suffering
for
license
sake
said
mistigris
you
see
i
did
know
the
count
said
oscar
possibly
but
you
ll
never
be
an
ambassador
replied
georges
when
people
want
to
talk
in
public
conveyances
they
ought
to
be
careful
like
me
to
talk
without
saying
that
s
what
speech
is
for
remarked
mistigris
by
way
of
conclusion
the
count
returned
to
his
seat
and
the
coucou
rolled
on
amid
the
deepest
silence
well
my
friends
said
the
count
when
they
reached
the
carreau
woods
here
we
all
are
as
silent
as
if
we
were
going
to
the
silence
gives
content
muttered
mistigris
the
weather
is
fine
said
georges
what
place
is
that
said
oscar
pointing
to
the
chateau
de
franconville
which
produces
a
fine
effect
at
that
particular
spot
backed
as
it
is
by
the
noble
forest
of
how
is
it
cried
the
count
that
you
who
say
you
go
so
often
to
presles
do
not
know
franconville
monsieur
knows
men
not
castles
said
mistigris
budding
diplomatists
have
so
much
else
to
take
their
minds
remarked
georges
be
so
good
as
to
remember
my
name
replied
oscar
furious
i
am
oscar
husson
and
ten
years
hence
i
shall
be
after
that
speech
uttered
with
bombastic
assumption
oscar
flung
himself
back
in
his
corner
husson
of
what
of
where
asked
mistigris
it
is
a
great
family
replied
the
count
husson
de
la
cerisaie
monsieur
was
born
beneath
the
steps
of
the
imperial
oscar
colored
crimson
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
was
penetrated
through
and
through
with
a
dreadful
foreboding
they
were
now
about
to
descend
the
steep
hill
of
la
cave
at
the
foot
of
which
in
a
narrow
valley
flanked
by
the
forest
of
stands
the
magnificent
chateau
of
presles
messieurs
said
the
count
i
wish
you
every
good
fortune
in
your
various
careers
monsieur
le
colonel
make
your
peace
with
the
king
of
france
the
ought
not
to
snub
the
bourbons
i
have
nothing
to
wish
for
you
my
dear
monsieur
schinner
your
fame
is
already
won
and
nobly
won
by
splendid
work
but
you
are
much
to
be
feared
in
domestic
life
and
i
being
a
married
man
dare
not
invite
you
to
my
house
as
for
monsieur
husson
he
needs
no
protection
he
possesses
the
secrets
of
statesmen
and
can
make
them
tremble
monsieur
leger
is
about
to
pluck
the
comte
de
serizy
and
i
can
only
exhort
him
to
do
it
with
a
firm
hand
pierrotin
put
me
out
here
and
pick
me
up
at
the
same
place
added
the
count
who
then
left
the
coach
and
took
a
path
through
the
woods
leaving
his
late
companions
confused
and
bewildered
he
must
be
that
count
who
has
hired
franconville
that
s
the
path
to
it
said
leger
if
ever
again
said
the
false
schinner
i
am
caught
in
a
public
coach
i
ll
fight
a
duel
with
myself
it
was
your
fault
mistigris
giving
his
rapin
a
tap
on
the
head
all
i
did
was
to
help
you
out
and
follow
you
to
venice
said
mistigris
but
that
s
always
the
way
fortune
belabors
the
let
me
tell
you
said
georges
to
his
neighbor
oscar
that
if
by
chance
that
was
the
comte
de
serizy
i
wouldn
t
be
in
your
skin
for
a
good
deal
healthy
as
you
think
oscar
remembering
his
mother
s
injunctions
which
these
words
recalled
to
his
mind
turned
pale
and
came
to
his
senses
here
you
are
messieurs
cried
pierrotin
pulling
up
at
a
fine
iron
gate
here
we
are
where
said
the
painter
and
georges
and
oscar
all
at
once
well
well
exclaimed
pierrotin
if
that
doesn
t
beat
all
ah
ca
monsieurs
have
none
of
you
been
here
before
why
this
is
the
chateau
de
oh
yes
all
right
friend
said
georges
recovering
his
audacity
but
i
happen
to
be
going
on
to
les
moulineaux
he
added
not
wishing
his
companions
to
know
that
he
was
really
going
to
the
chateau
you
don
t
say
so
then
you
are
coming
to
me
said
pere
leger
how
so
why
i
m
the
farmer
at
moulineaux
hey
colonel
what
brings
you
there
to
taste
your
butter
said
georges
pulling
out
his
portfolio
pierrotin
said
oscar
leave
my
things
at
the
steward
s
i
am
going
straight
to
the
whereupon
oscar
plunged
into
a
narrow
path
not
knowing
in
the
least
where
he
was
going
hi
monsieur
l
ambassadeur
cried
pere
leger
that
s
the
way
to
the
forest
if
you
really
want
to
get
to
the
chateau
go
through
the
little
thus
compelled
to
enter
oscar
disappeared
into
the
grand
while
pere
leger
stood
watching
oscar
georges
utterly
confounded
by
the
discovery
that
the
farmer
was
the
present
occupant
of
les
moulineaux
has
slipped
away
so
adroitly
that
when
the
fat
countryman
looked
round
for
his
colonel
there
was
no
sign
of
him
the
iron
gates
opened
at
pierrotin
s
demand
and
he
proudly
drove
in
to
deposit
with
the
concierge
the
thousand
and
one
utensils
belonging
to
the
great
schinner
oscar
was
thunderstruck
when
he
became
aware
that
mistigris
and
his
master
the
witnesses
of
his
bravado
were
to
be
installed
in
the
chateau
itself
in
ten
minutes
pierrotin
had
discharged
the
various
packages
of
the
painter
the
bundles
of
oscar
husson
and
the
pretty
little
leather
portmanteau
which
he
took
from
its
nest
of
hay
and
confided
mysteriously
to
the
wife
of
the
concierge
then
he
drove
out
of
the
courtyard
cracking
his
whip
and
took
the
road
that
led
through
the
forest
to
his
face
beaming
with
the
sly
expression
of
a
peasant
who
calculates
his
profits
nothing
was
lacking
now
to
his
happiness
on
the
morrow
he
would
have
his
thousand
francs
and
as
a
consequence
his
magnificent
new
coach
chapter
vi
the
moreau
interior
oscar
somewhat
abashed
was
skulking
behind
a
clump
of
trees
in
the
centre
of
the
and
watching
to
see
what
became
of
his
two
when
monsieur
moreau
suddenly
came
out
upon
the
portico
from
what
was
called
the
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
blue
overcoat
which
came
to
his
heels
breeches
of
yellowish
leather
and
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
ah
my
boy
so
here
you
are
how
is
the
dear
mamma
he
said
taking
oscar
by
the
hand
messieurs
he
added
to
mistigris
and
his
master
who
then
came
forward
you
are
no
doubt
the
two
painters
whom
monsieur
grindot
the
architect
told
me
to
he
whistled
twice
at
the
end
of
his
whip
the
concierge
came
take
these
gentlemen
to
rooms
and
madame
moreau
will
give
you
the
keys
go
with
them
to
show
the
way
make
fires
there
if
necessary
and
take
up
all
their
things
i
have
orders
from
monsieur
le
comte
he
added
addressing
the
two
young
men
to
invite
you
to
my
table
messieurs
we
dine
at
five
as
in
paris
if
you
like
hunting
you
will
find
plenty
to
amuse
you
i
have
a
license
from
the
eaux
et
forets
and
we
hunt
over
twelve
thousand
acres
of
forest
not
counting
our
own
oscar
the
painter
and
mistigris
all
more
or
less
subdued
exchanged
glances
but
mistigris
faithful
to
himself
remarked
in
a
low
tone
veni
vidi
cecidi
i
came
i
saw
i
oscar
followed
the
steward
who
led
him
along
at
a
rapid
pace
through
the
park
jacques
said
moreau
to
one
of
his
children
whom
they
met
run
in
and
tell
your
mother
that
little
husson
has
come
and
say
to
her
that
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
les
moulineaux
for
a
the
steward
then
about
fifty
years
old
was
a
dark
man
of
medium
height
and
seemed
stern
his
bilious
complexion
to
which
country
habits
had
added
a
certain
violent
coloring
conveyed
at
first
sight
the
impression
of
a
nature
which
was
other
than
his
own
his
blue
eyes
and
a
large
nose
gave
him
an
air
that
was
the
more
threatening
because
his
eyes
were
placed
too
close
together
but
his
large
lips
the
outline
of
his
face
and
the
easy
of
his
manner
soon
showed
that
his
nature
was
a
kindly
one
abrupt
in
speech
and
decided
in
tone
he
impressed
oscar
immensely
by
the
force
of
his
penetration
inspired
no
doubt
by
the
affection
which
he
felt
for
the
boy
trained
by
his
mother
to
magnify
the
steward
oscar
had
always
felt
himself
very
small
in
moreau
s
presence
but
on
reaching
presles
a
new
sensation
came
over
him
as
if
he
expected
some
harm
from
this
fatherly
figure
his
only
protector
well
my
oscar
you
don
t
look
pleased
at
getting
here
said
the
steward
and
yet
you
ll
find
plenty
of
amusement
you
shall
learn
to
ride
on
horseback
and
shoot
and
i
don
t
know
any
of
those
things
said
oscar
stupidly
but
i
brought
you
here
to
learn
mamma
told
me
only
to
stay
two
weeks
because
of
madame
oh
we
ll
see
about
that
replied
moreau
rather
wounded
that
his
conjugal
authority
was
doubted
moreau
s
youngest
son
an
active
strapping
lad
of
twelve
here
ran
up
come
said
his
father
take
oscar
to
your
he
himself
went
rapidly
along
the
shortest
path
to
the
gamekeeper
s
house
which
was
situated
between
the
park
and
the
forest
the
pavilion
or
lodge
in
which
the
count
had
established
his
steward
was
built
a
few
years
before
the
revolution
it
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
large
garden
one
wall
of
which
adjoined
the
of
the
stables
and
offices
of
the
chateau
itself
formerly
its
chief
entrance
was
on
the
main
road
to
the
village
but
after
the
count
s
father
bought
the
building
he
closed
that
entrance
and
united
the
place
with
his
own
property
the
house
built
of
freestone
in
the
style
of
the
period
of
louis
xv
it
is
enough
to
say
that
its
exterior
decoration
consisted
of
a
stone
drapery
beneath
the
windows
as
in
the
colonnades
of
the
place
louis
the
flutings
of
which
were
stiff
and
ungainly
had
on
the
a
fine
salon
opening
into
a
bedroom
and
a
connected
with
a
these
rooms
lying
parallel
to
one
another
were
separated
by
a
staircase
in
front
of
which
was
a
sort
of
peristyle
which
formed
an
on
which
the
two
suits
of
rooms
on
either
side
opened
the
kitchen
was
beneath
the
for
the
whole
building
was
raised
ten
steps
from
the
ground
level
by
placing
her
own
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
above
the
madame
moreau
was
able
to
transform
the
chamber
adjoining
the
salon
into
a
boudoir
these
two
rooms
were
richly
furnished
with
beautiful
pieces
culled
from
the
rare
old
furniture
of
the
chateau
the
salon
hung
with
blue
and
white
damask
formerly
the
curtains
of
the
was
draped
with
ample
portieres
and
window
curtains
lined
with
white
silk
pictures
evidently
from
old
panels
various
pretty
articles
of
modern
upholstery
handsome
lamps
and
a
rare
old
chandelier
gave
a
grandiose
appearance
to
the
room
the
carpet
was
a
persian
rug
the
boudoir
wholly
modern
and
furnished
entirely
after
madame
moreau
s
own
taste
was
arranged
in
imitation
of
a
tent
with
ropes
of
blue
silk
on
a
gray
background
the
classic
divan
was
there
of
course
with
its
pillows
and
footstools
the
taken
care
of
by
the
of
presles
rejoiced
the
eye
with
their
pyramids
of
bloom
the
and
were
furnished
in
mahogany
around
the
house
the
steward
s
wife
had
laid
out
a
beautiful
garden
carefully
cultivated
which
opened
into
the
great
park
groups
of
choice
parks
hid
the
offices
and
stables
to
improve
the
entrance
by
which
visitors
came
to
see
her
she
had
substituted
a
handsome
iron
gateway
for
the
shabby
railing
which
she
discarded
the
dependence
in
which
the
situation
of
their
dwelling
placed
the
moreaus
was
thus
adroitly
concealed
and
they
seemed
all
the
more
like
rich
and
independent
persons
taking
care
of
the
property
of
a
friend
because
neither
the
count
nor
the
countess
ever
came
to
presles
to
take
down
their
pretensions
moreover
the
perquisites
granted
by
monsieur
de
serizy
allowed
them
to
live
in
the
midst
of
that
abundance
which
is
the
luxury
of
country
life
milk
eggs
poultry
game
fruits
flowers
forage
vegetables
wood
the
steward
and
his
wife
used
in
profusion
buying
absolutely
nothing
but
butcher
wines
and
the
colonial
supplies
required
by
their
life
of
luxury
the
baked
their
bread
and
of
late
years
moreau
had
paid
his
butcher
with
pigs
from
the
farm
after
reserving
those
he
needed
for
his
own
use
on
one
occasion
the
countess
always
kind
and
good
to
her
former
maid
gave
her
as
a
souvenir
perhaps
a
little
the
fashion
of
which
was
out
of
date
moreau
had
it
repainted
and
now
drove
his
wife
about
the
country
with
two
good
horses
which
belonged
to
the
farm
besides
these
horses
moreau
had
his
own
he
did
enough
farming
on
the
count
s
property
to
keep
the
horses
and
maintain
his
servants
he
stacked
three
hundred
tons
of
excellent
hay
but
accounted
for
only
one
hundred
making
use
of
a
vague
permission
once
granted
by
the
count
he
kept
his
and
cattle
at
the
cost
of
the
estate
but
the
manure
of
the
stables
was
used
by
the
count
s
gardeners
all
these
little
stealings
had
some
ostensible
excuse
madame
moreau
had
taken
into
her
service
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
gardeners
who
was
first
her
maid
and
afterwards
her
cook
the
also
the
assisted
in
the
work
of
the
household
and
the
steward
had
hired
a
discharged
soldier
to
groom
the
horses
and
do
the
heavy
labor
at
nerville
chaumont
maffliers
nointel
and
other
places
of
the
neighborhood
the
handsome
wife
of
the
steward
was
received
by
persons
who
either
did
not
know
or
pretended
not
to
know
her
previous
condition
moreau
did
services
to
many
persons
he
induced
his
master
to
agree
to
certain
things
which
seem
trifles
in
paris
but
are
really
of
immense
importance
in
the
country
after
bringing
about
the
appointment
of
a
certain
juge
de
paix
at
beaumont
and
also
at
he
had
in
the
same
year
prevented
the
dismissal
of
a
of
the
forests
and
obtained
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
for
the
first
at
beaumont
consequently
no
festivity
was
ever
given
among
the
bourgeoisie
to
which
monsieur
and
madame
moreau
were
not
invited
the
rector
of
presles
and
the
mayor
of
presles
came
every
evening
to
play
cards
with
them
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
not
to
be
kind
and
hospitable
after
feathering
his
nest
so
comfortably
a
pretty
woman
and
an
affected
one
as
all
retired
of
great
ladies
are
for
after
they
are
married
they
imitate
their
mistresses
madame
moreau
imported
from
paris
all
the
new
fashions
she
wore
expensive
boots
and
never
was
seen
on
foot
except
occasionally
in
the
finest
weather
though
her
husband
allowed
but
five
hundred
francs
a
year
for
her
toilet
that
sum
is
immense
in
the
provinces
especially
if
well
laid
out
so
that
madame
moreau
fair
rosy
and
fresh
about
years
of
age
still
slender
and
delicate
in
shape
in
spite
of
her
three
children
played
the
young
girl
and
gave
herself
the
airs
of
a
princess
if
when
she
drove
by
in
her
caleche
some
stranger
had
asked
who
is
she
madame
moreau
would
have
been
furious
had
she
heard
the
reply
the
wife
of
the
steward
at
she
wished
to
be
taken
for
the
mistress
of
the
chateau
in
the
villages
she
patronized
the
people
in
the
tone
of
a
great
lady
the
influence
of
her
husband
over
the
count
proved
in
so
many
years
prevented
the
small
bourgeoisie
from
laughing
at
madame
moreau
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
peasants
was
really
a
personage
estelle
her
name
was
estelle
took
no
more
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
stewardship
then
the
wife
of
a
broker
does
in
her
husband
s
affairs
at
the
bourse
she
even
depended
on
moreau
for
the
care
of
the
household
and
their
own
fortune
confident
of
his
she
was
a
thousand
leagues
from
dreaming
that
this
comfortable
existence
which
had
lasted
for
seventeen
years
could
ever
be
endangered
and
yet
when
she
heard
of
the
count
s
determination
to
restore
the
magnificent
chateau
she
felt
that
her
enjoyments
were
threatened
and
she
urged
her
husband
to
come
to
the
arrangement
with
leger
about
les
moulineaux
so
that
they
might
retire
from
presles
and
live
at
she
had
no
intention
of
returning
to
a
position
that
was
more
or
less
that
of
a
servant
in
presence
of
her
former
mistress
who
indeed
would
have
laughed
to
see
her
established
in
the
lodge
with
all
the
airs
and
graces
of
a
woman
of
the
world
the
rancorous
enmity
which
existed
between
the
reyberts
and
the
moreaus
came
from
a
wound
inflicted
by
madame
de
reybert
upon
madame
moreau
on
the
first
occasion
when
the
latter
assumed
precedence
over
the
former
on
her
first
arrival
at
presles
the
wife
of
the
steward
being
determined
not
to
allow
her
supremacy
to
be
undermined
by
a
woman
nee
de
corroy
madame
de
reybert
thereupon
reminded
or
perhaps
informed
the
whole
of
madame
moreau
s
former
station
the
words
flew
from
lip
to
lip
the
envious
acquaintances
of
the
moreaus
throughout
the
neighborhood
from
beaumont
to
moisselles
began
to
carp
and
criticize
with
such
eagerness
that
a
few
sparks
of
the
conflagration
fell
into
the
moreau
household
for
four
years
the
reyberts
cut
dead
by
the
handsome
estelle
found
themselves
the
objects
of
so
much
animadversion
on
the
part
of
the
adherents
of
the
moreaus
that
their
position
at
presles
would
not
have
been
endurable
without
the
thought
of
vengeance
which
had
so
far
supported
them
the
moreaus
who
were
very
friendly
with
grindot
the
architect
had
received
notice
from
him
of
the
early
arrival
of
the
two
painters
sent
down
to
finish
the
decorations
of
the
chateau
the
principal
paintings
for
which
were
just
completed
by
schinner
the
great
painter
had
recommended
for
this
work
the
artist
who
was
accompanied
by
mistigris
for
two
days
past
madame
moreau
had
been
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
and
had
put
herself
under
arms
to
receive
him
an
artist
who
was
to
be
her
guest
and
companion
for
weeks
demanded
some
effort
schinner
and
his
wife
had
their
own
apartment
at
the
chateau
where
by
the
count
s
express
orders
they
were
treated
with
all
the
consideration
due
to
himself
grindot
who
stayed
at
the
steward
s
house
showed
such
respect
for
the
great
artist
that
neither
the
steward
nor
his
wife
had
attempted
to
put
themselves
on
familiar
terms
with
him
moreover
the
noblest
and
richest
people
in
the
surrounding
country
had
vied
with
each
other
in
paying
attention
to
schinner
and
his
wife
so
very
well
pleased
to
have
as
it
were
a
little
revenge
of
her
own
madame
moreau
was
determined
to
cry
up
the
artist
she
was
now
expecting
and
to
present
him
to
her
social
circle
as
equal
in
talent
to
the
great
schinner
though
for
two
days
past
moreau
s
pretty
wife
had
arrayed
herself
coquettishly
the
prettiest
of
her
toilets
had
been
reserved
for
this
very
saturday
when
as
she
felt
no
doubt
the
artist
would
arrive
for
dinner
a
pink
gown
in
very
narrow
stripes
a
pink
belt
with
a
richly
chased
gold
buckle
a
velvet
ribbon
and
cross
at
her
throat
and
velvet
bracelets
on
her
bare
arms
madame
de
serizy
had
handsome
arms
and
showed
them
much
together
with
bronze
kid
shoes
and
thread
stockings
gave
madame
moreau
all
the
appearance
of
an
elegant
parisian
she
wore
also
a
superb
bonnet
of
leghorn
straw
trimmed
with
a
bunch
of
moss
roses
from
nattier
s
beneath
the
spreading
sides
of
which
rippled
the
curls
of
her
beautiful
blond
hair
after
ordering
a
very
choice
dinner
and
reviewing
the
condition
of
her
rooms
she
walked
about
the
grounds
so
as
to
be
seen
standing
near
a
in
the
of
the
chateau
like
the
mistress
of
the
house
on
the
arrival
of
the
coach
from
paris
she
held
above
her
head
a
charming
parasol
lined
with
white
silk
and
fringed
seeing
that
pierrotin
merely
left
mistigris
s
queer
packages
with
the
concierge
having
apparently
brought
no
passengers
estelle
retired
disappointed
and
regretting
the
trouble
of
making
her
useless
toilet
like
many
persons
who
are
dressed
in
their
best
she
felt
incapable
of
any
other
occupation
than
that
of
sitting
idly
in
her
salon
awaiting
the
coach
from
beaumont
which
usually
passed
about
an
hour
after
that
of
pierrotin
though
it
did
not
leave
paris
till
she
was
therefore
in
her
own
apartment
when
the
two
artists
walked
up
to
the
chateau
and
were
sent
by
moreau
himself
to
their
rooms
where
they
made
their
regulation
toilet
for
dinner
the
pair
had
asked
questions
of
their
guide
the
gardener
who
told
them
so
much
of
moreau
s
beauty
that
they
felt
the
necessity
of
rigging
themselves
up
studio
slang
they
therefore
put
on
their
most
superlative
suits
and
then
walked
over
to
the
steward
s
lodge
piloted
by
jacques
moreau
the
eldest
son
a
hardy
youth
dressed
like
an
english
boy
in
a
handsome
jacket
with
a
collar
who
was
spending
his
vacation
like
a
fish
in
water
on
the
estate
where
his
father
and
mother
reigned
as
aristocrats
mamma
he
said
here
are
the
two
artists
sent
down
by
monsieur
madame
moreau
agreeably
surprised
rose
told
her
son
to
place
chairs
and
began
to
display
her
graces
mamma
the
husson
boy
is
with
papa
added
the
lad
shall
i
fetch
him
you
need
not
hurry
go
and
play
with
him
said
his
mother
the
remark
you
need
not
hurry
proved
to
the
two
artists
the
unimportance
of
their
late
travelling
companion
in
the
eyes
of
their
hostess
but
it
also
showed
what
they
did
not
know
the
feeling
of
a
against
a
madame
moreau
after
seventeen
years
of
married
life
could
not
be
ignorant
of
the
steward
s
attachment
to
madame
clapart
and
the
little
husson
and
she
hated
both
mother
and
child
so
vehemently
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
moreau
had
never
before
risked
bringing
oscar
to
presles
we
are
requested
my
husband
and
myself
she
said
to
the
two
artists
to
do
you
the
honors
of
the
chateau
we
both
love
art
and
above
all
artists
she
added
in
a
mincing
tone
and
i
beg
you
to
make
yourselves
at
home
here
in
the
country
you
know
every
one
should
be
at
their
ease
one
must
feel
wholly
at
liberty
or
life
is
insipid
we
have
already
had
monsieur
schinner
with
mistigris
gave
a
sly
glance
at
his
companion
you
know
him
of
course
continued
estelle
after
a
slight
pause
who
does
not
know
him
madame
said
the
painter
knows
him
like
his
double
remarked
mistigris
monsieur
grindot
told
me
your
name
said
madame
moreau
to
the
painter
but
joseph
bridau
he
replied
wondering
with
what
sort
of
woman
he
had
to
do
mistigris
began
to
rebel
internally
against
the
patronizing
manner
of
the
steward
s
wife
but
he
waited
like
bridau
for
some
word
which
might
give
him
his
cue
one
of
those
words
de
singe
a
dauphin
which
artists
cruel
of
the
ridiculous
the
pabulum
of
their
pencils
seize
with
such
avidity
meantime
estelle
s
clumsy
hands
and
feet
struck
their
eyes
and
presently
a
word
or
phrase
or
two
betrayed
her
past
and
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
elegance
of
her
dress
made
the
two
young
fellows
aware
of
their
prey
a
single
glance
at
each
other
was
enough
to
arrange
a
scheme
that
they
should
take
estelle
seriously
on
her
own
ground
and
thus
find
amusement
enough
during
the
time
of
their
stay
you
say
you
love
art
madame
perhaps
you
cultivate
it
successfully
said
joseph
bridau
no
without
being
neglected
my
education
was
purely
commercial
but
i
have
so
profound
and
delicate
a
sense
of
art
that
monsieur
schinner
always
asked
me
when
he
had
finished
a
piece
of
work
to
give
him
my
opinion
on
just
as
moliere
consulted
la
foret
said
mistigris
not
knowing
that
la
foret
was
moliere
s
madame
moreau
inclined
her
head
graciously
showing
that
in
her
ignorance
she
accepted
the
speech
as
a
compliment
didn
t
he
propose
to
croquer
you
asked
bridau
painters
are
eager
enough
after
handsome
what
may
you
mean
by
such
language
in
the
studios
we
say
croquer
craunch
nibble
for
sketching
interposed
mistigris
with
an
insinuating
air
and
we
are
always
wanting
to
croquer
beautiful
heads
that
s
the
origin
of
the
expression
she
is
pretty
enough
to
i
was
not
aware
of
the
origin
of
the
term
she
replied
with
the
sweetest
glance
at
mistigris
my
pupil
here
said
bridau
monsieur
leon
de
lora
shows
a
remarkable
talent
for
portraiture
he
would
be
too
happy
i
know
to
leave
you
a
souvenir
of
our
stay
by
painting
your
charming
head
joseph
bridau
made
a
sign
to
mistigris
which
meant
come
sail
in
and
push
the
matter
she
is
not
so
bad
in
looks
this
accepting
the
glance
leon
de
lora
slid
down
upon
the
sofa
beside
estelle
and
took
her
hand
which
she
permitted
oh
madame
if
you
would
like
to
offer
a
surprise
to
your
husband
and
will
give
me
a
few
secret
sittings
i
would
endeavor
to
surpass
myself
you
are
so
beautiful
so
fresh
so
charming
a
man
without
any
talent
might
become
a
genius
in
painting
you
he
would
draw
from
your
eyes
we
must
paint
your
dear
children
in
the
arabesques
said
bridau
interrupting
mistigris
i
would
rather
have
them
in
the
salon
but
perhaps
i
am
indiscreet
in
asking
it
she
replied
looking
at
bridau
coquettishly
beauty
madame
is
a
sovereign
whom
all
painters
worship
it
has
unlimited
claims
upon
they
are
both
charming
thought
madame
moreau
do
you
enjoy
driving
shall
i
take
you
through
the
woods
after
dinner
in
my
carriage
oh
oh
oh
cried
mistigris
in
three
ecstatic
tones
why
presles
will
prove
our
terrestrial
with
an
eve
a
fair
young
fascinating
woman
added
bridau
just
as
madame
moreau
was
bridling
and
soaring
to
the
seventh
heaven
she
was
recalled
like
a
kite
by
a
twitch
at
its
line
madame
cried
her
bursting
into
the
room
rosalie
said
her
mistress
who
allowed
you
to
come
here
without
being
sent
for
rosalie
paid
no
heed
to
the
rebuke
but
whispered
in
her
mistress
s
ear
the
count
is
at
the
has
he
asked
for
me
said
the
steward
s
wife
no
madame
but
he
wants
his
trunk
and
the
key
of
his
then
give
them
to
him
she
replied
making
an
impatient
gesture
to
hide
her
real
trouble
mamma
here
s
oscar
husson
said
her
youngest
son
bringing
in
oscar
who
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
on
seeing
the
two
artists
in
evening
dress
oh
so
you
have
come
my
little
oscar
said
estelle
stiffly
i
hope
you
will
now
go
and
dress
she
added
after
looking
at
him
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
your
mother
i
presume
has
not
accustomed
you
to
dine
in
such
clothes
as
oh
cried
the
cruel
mistigris
a
future
diplomatist
knows
the
saying
that
two
coats
are
better
than
how
do
you
mean
a
future
diplomatist
exclaimed
madame
moreau
poor
oscar
had
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
in
turn
from
joseph
to
leon
merely
a
joke
made
in
travelling
replied
joseph
who
wanted
to
save
oscar
s
feelings
out
of
pity
the
boy
just
wanted
to
be
funny
like
the
rest
of
us
and
he
blagued
that
s
all
said
mistigris
madame
said
rosalie
returning
to
the
door
of
the
salon
his
excellency
has
ordered
dinner
for
eight
and
wants
it
served
at
six
o
clock
what
are
we
to
do
during
estelle
s
conference
with
her
the
two
artists
and
oscar
looked
at
each
other
in
consternation
their
glances
were
expressive
of
terrible
apprehension
his
excellency
who
is
he
said
joseph
bridau
why
monsieur
le
comte
de
serizy
of
course
replied
little
moreau
could
it
have
been
the
count
in
the
coucou
said
leon
de
lora
oh
exclaimed
oscar
the
comte
de
serizy
always
travels
in
his
own
carriage
with
four
how
did
the
comte
de
serizy
get
here
said
the
painter
to
madame
moreau
when
she
returned
much
discomfited
to
the
salon
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
she
said
i
can
not
explain
to
myself
this
sudden
arrival
nor
do
i
know
what
has
brought
him
and
moreau
not
here
his
excellency
wishes
monsieur
schinner
to
come
over
to
the
chateau
said
the
gardener
coming
to
the
door
of
the
salon
and
he
begs
monsieur
schinner
to
give
him
the
pleasure
to
dine
with
him
also
monsieur
done
for
cried
the
rapin
laughing
he
whom
we
took
for
a
bourgeois
in
the
coucou
was
the
count
you
may
well
say
sour
are
the
curses
of
oscar
was
very
nearly
changed
to
a
pillar
of
salt
for
at
this
revelation
his
throat
felt
saltier
than
the
sea
and
you
who
talked
to
him
about
his
wife
s
lovers
and
his
skin
diseases
said
mistigris
turning
on
oscar
what
does
he
mean
exclaimed
the
steward
s
wife
gazing
after
the
two
artists
who
went
away
laughing
at
the
expression
of
oscar
s
face
oscar
remained
dumb
confounded
stupefied
hearing
nothing
though
madame
moreau
questioned
him
and
shook
him
violently
by
his
arm
which
she
caught
and
squeezed
she
gained
nothing
however
and
was
forced
to
leave
him
in
the
salon
without
an
answer
for
rosalie
appeared
again
to
ask
for
linen
and
silver
and
to
beg
she
would
go
herself
and
see
that
the
multiplied
orders
of
the
count
were
executed
all
the
household
together
with
the
gardeners
and
the
concierge
and
his
wife
were
going
and
coming
in
a
confusion
that
may
readily
be
imagined
the
master
had
fallen
upon
his
own
house
like
a
bombshell
from
the
top
of
the
hill
near
la
cave
where
he
left
the
coach
the
count
had
gone
by
the
path
through
the
woods
to
him
to
the
house
of
his
gamekeeper
the
keeper
was
amazed
when
he
saw
his
real
master
is
moreau
here
said
the
count
i
see
his
no
monseigneur
he
means
to
go
to
moulineaux
before
dinner
and
he
has
left
his
horse
here
while
he
went
to
the
chateau
to
give
a
few
if
you
value
your
place
said
the
count
you
will
take
that
horse
and
ride
at
once
to
beaumont
where
you
will
deliver
to
monsieur
margueron
the
note
that
i
shall
now
so
saying
the
count
entered
the
keeper
s
lodge
and
wrote
a
line
folding
it
in
a
way
impossible
to
open
without
detection
and
gave
it
to
the
man
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
in
the
saddle
not
a
word
to
any
one
he
said
and
as
for
you
madame
he
added
to
the
gamekeeper
s
wife
if
moreau
comes
back
for
his
horse
tell
him
merely
that
i
have
taken
the
count
then
crossed
the
park
and
entered
the
of
the
chateau
through
the
iron
gates
however
a
man
may
be
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
public
life
by
his
own
emotions
by
his
own
mistakes
and
disappointments
the
soul
of
any
man
able
to
love
deeply
at
the
count
s
age
is
still
young
and
sensitive
to
treachery
monsieur
de
serizy
had
felt
such
pain
at
the
thought
that
moreau
had
deceived
him
that
even
after
hearing
the
conversation
at
he
thought
him
less
an
accomplice
of
leger
and
the
notary
than
their
tool
on
the
threshold
of
the
inn
and
while
that
conversation
was
still
going
on
he
thought
of
pardoning
his
steward
after
giving
him
a
good
reproof
strange
to
say
the
dishonesty
of
his
confidential
agent
occupied
his
mind
as
a
mere
episode
from
the
moment
when
oscar
revealed
his
infirmities
secrets
so
carefully
guarded
could
only
have
been
revealed
by
moreau
who
had
no
doubt
laughed
over
the
hidden
troubles
of
his
benefactor
with
either
madame
de
serizy
s
former
maid
or
with
the
aspasia
of
the
directory
as
he
walked
along
the
this
peer
of
france
this
statesman
wept
as
young
men
weep
he
wept
his
last
tears
all
human
feelings
were
so
cruelly
hurt
by
one
stroke
that
the
usually
calm
man
staggered
through
his
park
like
a
wounded
deer
when
moreau
arrived
at
the
gamekeeper
s
lodge
and
asked
for
his
horse
the
keeper
s
wife
replied
monsieur
le
comte
has
just
taken
monsieur
le
comte
cried
moreau
whom
do
you
mean
why
the
comte
de
serizy
our
master
she
replied
he
is
probably
at
the
chateau
by
this
time
she
added
anxious
to
be
rid
of
the
steward
who
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
her
words
turned
back
towards
the
chateau
but
he
presently
turned
again
and
came
back
to
the
lodge
intending
to
question
the
woman
more
closely
for
he
began
to
see
something
serious
in
this
secret
arrival
and
the
apparently
strange
method
of
his
master
s
return
but
the
wife
of
the
gamekeeper
alarmed
to
find
herself
caught
in
a
vise
between
the
count
and
his
steward
had
locked
herself
into
the
house
resolved
not
to
open
to
any
but
her
husband
moreau
more
and
more
uneasy
ran
rapidly
in
spite
of
his
boots
and
spurs
to
the
chateau
where
he
was
told
that
the
count
was
dressing
seven
persons
invited
to
dinner
cried
rosalie
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
moreau
then
went
through
the
offices
to
his
own
house
on
his
way
he
met
the
who
was
having
an
altercation
with
a
handsome
young
man
monsieur
le
comte
particularly
told
me
a
colonel
an
of
mina
insisted
the
girl
i
am
not
a
colonel
replied
georges
but
isn
t
your
name
georges
what
s
all
this
said
the
steward
intervening
monsieur
my
name
is
georges
marest
i
am
the
son
of
a
rich
wholesale
ironmonger
in
the
rue

on
business
to
monsieur
le
comte
de
serizy
from
maitre
crottat
a
notary
whose
second
clerk

and
i
said
the
girl

him
that

said
to
me

a
colonel

to
mina
he
ll
come
by
pierrotin
s
coach
if
he
asks
for
me
show
him
into
the
evidently
said
the
clerk
the
count
is
a
traveller
who
came
down
with
us
in
pierrotin
s
coucou
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
politeness
of
a
young
man
he
d
have
come
as
a
a
rabbit
in
pierrotin
s
coucou
exclaimed
moreau
and
the
together
i
am
sure
of
it
from
what
this
girl
is
now
saying
said
georges
how
so
asked
the
steward
ah
that
s
the
point
cried
the
clerk
to
hoax
the
travellers
and
have
a
bit
of
fun
i
told
them
a
lot
of
stuff
about
egypt
and
greece
and
spain
as
i
happened
to
be
wearing
spurs
i
have
myself
out
for
a
colonel
of
cavalry
pure
nonsense
tell
me
said
moreau
what
did
this
traveller
you
take
to
be
monsieur
le
comte
look
like

like
a
brick
said
georges
hair
and
black
that
is
he
then
i
m
lost
exclaimed
georges
why
oh
i
chaffed
him
about
his
pooh
he
s
a
good
fellow
you
probably
amused
him
come
at
once
to
the
chateau
i
ll
go
in
and
see
his
excellency
where
did
you
say
he
left
the
coach
at
the
top
of
the
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
after
all
thought
georges
though
i
did
blague
him
i
didn
t
say
anything
why
have
you
come
here
asked
the
steward
i
have
brought
the
deed
of
sale
for
the
farm
at
moulineaux
all
ready
for
good
heavens
exclaimed
the
steward
i
don
t
understand
one
word
of
all
this
moreau
felt
his
heart
beat
painfully
when
after
giving
two
raps
on
his
master
s
door
he
heard
the
words
is
that
you
moreau
yes
come
the
count
was
now
wearing
a
pair
of
white
trousers
and
thin
boots
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
black
coat
on
which
shone
the
grand
cross
of
the
legion
upon
the
right
breast
and
fastened
to
a
buttonhole
on
the
left
was
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
hanging
by
a
short
gold
chain
he
had
arranged
his
hair
himself
and
had
no
doubt
put
himself
in
full
dress
to
do
the
honors
of
presles
to
monsieur
margueron
and
possibly
to
impress
the
good
man
s
mind
with
a
prestige
of
grandeur
well
monsieur
said
the
count
who
remained
seated
leaving
moreau
to
stand
before
him
we
have
not
concluded
that
purchase
from
he
asks
too
much
for
the
farm
at
the
present
but
why
is
he
not
coming
to
dinner
as
i
requested
monseigneur
he
is
are
you
sure
i
have
just
come
from
monsieur
said
the
count
with
a
stern
air
which
was
really
terrible
what
would
you
do
with
a
man
whom
you
trusted
if
after
seeing
you
dress
wounds
which
you
desired
to
keep
secret
from
all
the
world
he
should
reveal
your
misfortunes
and
laugh
at
your
malady
with
a
strumpet
i
would
thrash
him
for
and
if
you
discovered
that
he
was
also
betraying
your
confidence
and
robbing
you
i
should
endeavor
to
detect
him
and
send
him
to
the
monsieur
moreau
listen
to
me
you
have
undoubtedly
spoken
of
my
infirmities
to
madame
clapart
you
have
laughed
at
her
house
and
with
her
over
my
attachment
to
the
comtesse
de
serizy
for
her
son
little
husson
told
a
number
of
circumstances
relating
to
my
medical
treatment
to
travellers
by
a
public
conveyance
in
my
presence
and
heaven
knows
in
what
language
he
dared
to
calumniate
my
wife
besides
this
i
learned
from
the
lips
of
pere
leger
himself
who
was
in
the
coach
of
the
plan
laid
by
the
notary
at
beaumont
and
by
you
and
by
himself
in
relation
to
les
moulineaux
if
you
have
been
as
you
say
to
monsieur
margueron
it
was
to
tell
him
to
feign
illness
he
is
so
little
ill
that
he
is
coming
here
to
dinner
this
evening
now
monsieur
i
could
pardon
you
having
made
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
out
of
your
situation
in
seventeen
years
i
can
understand
that
you
might
each
time
have
asked
me
for
what
you
took
and
i
would
have
given
it
to
you
but
let
that
pass
you
have
been
notwithstanding
this
disloyalty
better
than
others
as
i
believe
but
that
you
who
knew
my
toil
for
our
country
for
france
you
have
seen
me
giving
night
after
night
to
the
emperor
s
service
and
working
eighteen
hours
of
each
for
months
together
you
who
knew
my
love
for
madame
de
serizy
that
you
should
have
gossiped
about
me
before
a
boy
holding
up
my
secrets
and
my
affections
to
the
ridicule
of
a
madame
husson
monseigneur
it
is
unpardonable
to
injure
a
man
s
interest
why
that
is
nothing
but
to
stab
his
heart
oh
you
do
not
know
what
you
have
done
the
count
put
his
head
in
his
hands
and
was
silent
for
some
moments
i
leave
you
what
you
have
gained
he
said
after
a
time
and
i
shall
forget
you
for
my
sake
for
my
dignity
and
for
your
honor
we
will
part
decently
for
i
can
not
but
remember
even
now
what
your
father
did
for
mine
you
will
explain
the
duties
of
the
stewardship
in
a
proper
manner
to
monsieur
de
reybert
who
succeeds
you
be
calm
as
i
am
give
no
opportunity
for
fools
to
talk
above
all
let
there
be
no
recrimination
or
petty
meanness
though
you
no
longer
possess
my
confidence
endeavor
to
behave
with
the
decorum
of
persons
as
for
that
miserable
boy
who
has
wounded
me
to
death
i
will
not
have
him
sleep
at
presles
send
him
to
the
inn
i
will
not
answer
for
my
own
temper
if
i
see
i
do
not
deserve
such
gentleness
monseigneur
said
moreau
with
tears
in
his
eyes
yes
you
are
right
if
i
had
been
utterly
dishonest
i
should
now
be
worth
five
hundred
thousand
francs
instead
of
half
that
sum
i
offer
to
give
you
an
account
of
my
fortune
with
all
its
details
but
let
me
tell
you
monseigneur
that
in
talking
of
you
with
madame
clapart
it
was
never
in
derision
but
on
the
contrary
to
deplore
your
state
and
to
ask
her
for
certain
remedies
not
used
by
physicians
but
known
to
the
common
people
i
spoke
of
your
feelings
before
the
boy
who
was
in
his
bed
and
as
i
supposed
asleep
it
seems
he
must
have
been
awake
and
listening
to
us
with
the
utmost
affection
and
respect
alas
fate
wills
that
indiscretions
be
punished
like
crimes
but
while
accepting
the
results
of
your
just
anger
i
wish
you
to
know
what
actually
took
place
it
was
indeed
from
heart
to
heart
that
i
spoke
of
you
to
madame
clapart
as
for
my
wife
i
have
never
said
one
word
of
these
things
enough
said
the
count
whose
conviction
was
now
complete
we
are
not
children
all
is
now
irrevocable
put
your
affairs
and
mine
in
order
you
can
stay
in
the
pavilion
until
october
monsieur
and
madame
de
reybert
will
lodge
for
the
present
in
the
chateau
endeavor
to
keep
on
terms
with
them
like
persons
who
hate
each
other
but
still
keep
up
the
count
and
moreau
went
downstairs
moreau
white
as
the
count
s
hair
the
count
himself
calm
and
dignified
during
the
time
this
interview
lasted
the
beaumont
coach
which
left
paris
at
one
o
clock
had
stopped
before
the
gates
of
the
chateau
and
deposited
maitre
crottat
the
notary
who
was
shown
according
to
the
count
s
orders
into
the
salon
where
he
found
his
clerk
extremely
subdued
in
manner
and
the
two
painters
all
three
of
them
painfully
and
embarrassed
monsieur
de
reybert
a
man
of
fifty
with
a
crabbed
expression
of
face
was
also
there
accompanied
by
old
margueron
and
the
notary
of
beaumont
who
held
in
his
hand
a
bundle
of
deeds
and
other
papers
when
these
various
personages
saw
the
count
in
evening
dress
and
wearing
his
orders
georges
marest
had
a
slight
sensation
of
colic
joseph
bridau
quivered
but
mistigris
who
was
conscious
of
being
in
his
sunday
clothes
and
had
moreover
nothing
on
his
conscience
remarked
in
a
sufficiently
loud
tone
well
he
looks
a
great
deal
better
like
little
scamp
said
the
count
catching
him
by
the
ear
we
are
both
in
the
decoration
business
i
hope
you
recognize
your
own
work
my
dear
schinner
he
added
pointing
to
the
ceiling
of
the
salon
monseigneur
replied
the
artist
i
did
wrong
to
take
such
a
celebrated
name
out
of
mere
bravado
but
this
day
will
oblige
me
to
do
fine
things
for
you
and
so
bring
credit
on
my
own
name
of
joseph
you
took
up
my
defence
said
the
count
hastily
and
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
as
well
as
my
lively
friend
your
excellency
doesn
t
know
to
what
you
expose
yourself
said
the
saucy
rapin
facilis
descensus
victuali
as
we
say
at
the
black
bridau
exclaimed
the
minister
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
are
you
any
relation
to
one
of
the
most
devoted
toilers
under
the
empire
the
head
of
a
bureau
who
fell
a
victim
to
his
zeal
his
son
monseigneur
replied
joseph
bowing
then
you
are
most
welcome
here
said
the
count
taking
bridau
s
hand
in
both
of
his
i
knew
your
father
and
you
can
count
on
me
as
on
on
an
uncle
in
america
added
the
count
laughing
but
you
are
too
young
to
have
pupils
of
your
own
to
whom
does
mistigris
really
belong
to
my
friend
schinner
who
lent
him
to
me
said
joseph
mistigris
name
is
leon
de
lora
monseigneur
if
you
knew
my
father
will
you
deign
to
think
of
his
other
son
who
is
now
accused
of
plotting
against
the
state
and
is
soon
to
be
tried
before
the
court
of
peers
ah
that
s
true
said
the
count
yes
i
will
think
about
it
be
sure
of
that
as
for
colonel
the
friend
of
ali
pacha
and
mina
s
he
continued
walking
up
to
georges
he
why
that
s
my
second
clerk
cried
crottat
you
are
quite
mistaken
maitre
crottat
said
the
count
assuming
a
stern
air
a
clerk
who
intends
to
be
a
notary
does
not
leave
important
deeds
in
a
diligence
at
the
mercy
of
other
travellers
neither
does
he
spend
twenty
francs
between
paris
and
moisselles
or
expose
himself
to
be
arrested
as
a
deserter
monseigneur
said
georges
marest
i
may
have
amused
myself
with
the
bourgeois
in
the
diligence
but
let
his
excellency
finish
what
he
was
saying
said
the
notary
digging
his
elbow
into
his
clerk
s
ribs
a
notary
continued
the
count
ought
to
practise
discretion
shrewdness
caution
from
the
start
he
should
be
incapable
of
such
a
blunder
as
taking
a
peer
of
france
for
a
i
am
willing
to
be
blamed
for
my
faults
said
georges
but
i
never
left
my
deeds
at
the
mercy
of
now
you
are
committing
the
fault
of
contradicting
the
word
of
a
minister
of
state
a
gentleman
an
old
man
and
a
client
said
the
count
give
me
that
deed
of
georges
turned
over
and
over
the
papers
in
his
portfolio
that
will
do
don
t
disarrange
those
papers
said
the
count
taking
the
deed
from
his
pocket
here
is
what
you
are
looking
crottat
turned
the
paper
back
and
forth
so
astonished
was
he
at
receiving
it
from
the
hands
of
his
client
what
does
this
mean
monsieur
he
said
finally
to
georges
if
i
had
not
taken
it
said
the
count
pere
leger
who
is
by
no
means
such
a
ninny
as
you
thought
him
from
his
questions
about
agriculture
by
which
he
showed
that
he
attended
to
his
own
business
pere
leger
might
have
seized
that
paper
and
guessed
my
purpose
you
must
give
me
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
but
one
on
condition
that
of
describing
as
you
promised
the
execution
of
the
muslim
of
smyrna
and
you
must
also
finish
the
memoirs
of
some
client
which
you
have
certainly
read
to
be
so
well
schlague
for
blague
said
leon
de
lora
in
a
whisper
to
joseph
bridau
gentlemen
said
the
count
to
the
two
notaries
and
messieurs
margueron
and
de
reybert
let
us
go
into
the
next
room
and
conclude
this
business
before
dinner
because
as
my
friend
mistigris
would
say
qui
esurit
well
he
is
very
said
leon
de
lora
to
georges
marest
when
the
count
had
left
the
room
yes
he
may
be
but
my
master
isn
t
said
georges
and
he
will
request
me
to
go
and
blaguer
somewhere
never
mind
you
like
travel
said
bridau
what
a
dressing
that
boy
will
get
from
monsieur
and
madame
moreau
cried
mistigris
little
idiot
said
georges
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
the
count
would
have
been
amused
well
anyhow
the
lesson
is
a
good
one
and
if
ever
again
i
am
caught
bragging
in
a
public
coach
it
is
a
stupid
thing
to
do
said
joseph
bridau
and
common
added
mistigris
vulgarity
is
the
brother
of
while
the
matter
of
the
sale
was
being
settled
between
monsieur
margueron
and
the
comte
de
serizy
assisted
by
their
respective
notaries
in
presence
of
monsieur
de
reybert
the
walked
with
slow
steps
to
his
own
house
there
he
entered
the
salon
and
sat
down
without
noticing
anything
little
husson
who
was
present
slipped
into
a
corner
out
of
sight
so
much
did
the
livid
face
of
his
mother
s
friend
alarm
him
eh
my
friend
said
estelle
coming
into
the
room
somewhat
tired
with
what
she
had
been
doing
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
we
are
lost
lost
beyond
recovery
i
am
no
longer
steward
of
presles
no
longer
in
the
count
s
why
not
pere
leger
who
was
in
pierrotin
s
coach
told
the
count
all
about
the
affair
of
les
moulineaux
but
that
is
not
the
thing
that
has
cost
me
his
what
then
oscar
spoke
ill
of
the
countess
and
he
told
about
the
count
s
oscar
cried
madame
moreau
ah
my
dear
your
sin
has
found
you
out
it
was
well
worth
while
to
warm
that
young
serpent
in
your
bosom
how
often
i
have
told
you
enough
said
moreau
in
a
strained
voice
at
this
moment
estelle
and
her
husband
discovered
oscar
cowering
in
his
corner
moreau
swooped
down
on
the
luckless
lad
like
a
hawk
on
its
prey
took
him
by
the
collar
of
the
coat
and
dragged
him
to
the
light
of
a
window
speak
what
did
you
say
to
monseigneur
in
that
coach
what
demon
let
loose
your
tongue
you
who
keep
a
doltish
silence
whenever
i
speak
to
you
what
did
you
do
it
for
cried
the
steward
with
frightful
violence
too
bewildered
to
weep
oscar
was
dumb
and
motionless
as
a
statue
come
with
me
and
beg
his
excellency
s
pardon
said
moreau
as
if
his
excellency
cares
for
a
little
toad
like
that
cried
the
furious
estelle
come
i
say
to
the
chateau
repeated
moreau
oscar
dropped
like
an
inert
mass
to
the
ground
come
cried
moreau
his
anger
increasing
at
every
instant
no
no
mercy
cried
oscar
who
could
not
bring
himself
to
submit
to
a
torture
that
seemed
to
him
worse
than
death
moreau
then
took
the
lad
by
his
coat
and
dragged
him
as
he
might
a
dead
body
through
the
yards
which
rang
with
the
boy
s
outcries
and
sobs
he
pulled
him
up
the
portico
and
with
an
arm
that
fury
made
powerful
he
flung
him
bellowing
and
rigid
as
a
pole
into
the
salon
at
the
very
feet
of
the
count
who
having
completed
the
purchase
of
les
moulineaux
was
about
to
leave
the
salon
for
the
with
his
guests
on
your
knees
wretched
boy
and
ask
pardon
of
him
who
gave
food
to
your
mind
by
obtaining
your
oscar
his
face
to
the
ground
was
foaming
with
rage
and
did
not
say
a
word
the
spectators
of
the
scene
were
shocked
moreau
seemed
no
longer
in
his
senses
his
face
was
crimson
with
injected
blood
this
young
man
is
a
mere
lump
of
vanity
said
the
count
after
waiting
a
moment
for
oscar
s
excuses
a
proud
man
humiliates
himself
because
he
sees
there
is
grandeur
in
a
certain
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
never
make
much
of
that
so
saying
his
excellency
passed
on
moreau
took
oscar
home
with
him
and
on
the
way
gave
orders
that
the
horses
should
immediately
be
put
to
madame
moreau
s
caleche
chapter
vii
a
mother
s
trials
while
the
horses
were
being
harnessed
moreau
wrote
the
following
letter
to
madame
clapart
my
dear
oscar
has
ruined
me
during
his
journey
in
pierrotin
s
coach
he
spoke
of
madame
de
serizy
s
behavior
to
his
excellency
who
was
travelling
incognito
and
actually
told
to
himself
the
secret
of
his
terrible
malady
after
dismissing
me
from
my
stewardship
the
count
told
me
not
to
let
oscar
sleep
at
presles
but
to
send
him
away
immediately
therefore
to
obey
his
orders
the
horses
are
being
harnessed
at
this
moment
to
my
wife
s
carriage
and
brochon
my
will
take
the
miserable
child
to
you
we
are
my
wife
and
i
in
a
distress
of
mind
which
you
may
perhaps
imagine
though
i
can
not
describe
it
to
you
i
will
see
you
in
a
few
days
for
i
must
take
another
course
i
have
three
children
and
i
ought
to
consider
their
future
at
present
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
but
i
shall
certainly
endeavor
to
make
the
count
aware
of
what
seventeen
years
of
the
life
of
a
man
like
myself
is
worth
owning
at
the
present
moment
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
i
want
to
raise
myself
to
a
fortune
which
may
some
day
make
me
the
equal
of
his
excellency
at
this
moment
i
feel
within
me
the
power
to
move
mountains
and
vanquish
insurmountable
difficulties
what
a
lever
is
such
a
scene
of
bitter
humiliation
as
i
have
just
passed
through
whose
blood
has
oscar
in
his
veins
his
conduct
has
been
that
of
a
blockhead
up
to
this
moment
when
i
write
to
you
he
has
not
said
a
word
nor
answered
even
by
a
sign
the
questions
my
wife
and
i
have
put
to
him
will
he
become
an
idiot
or
is
he
one
already
dear
friend
why
did
you
not
instruct
him
as
to
his
behavior
before
you
sent
him
to
me
how
many
misfortunes
you
would
have
spared
me
had
you
brought
him
here
yourself
as
i
begged
you
to
do
if
estelle
alarmed
you
you
might
have
stayed
at
moisselles
however
the
thing
is
done
and
there
is
no
use
talking
about
it
adieu
i
shall
see
you
soon
your
devoted
servant
and
friend
moreau
at
eight
o
clock
that
evening
madame
clapart
just
returned
from
a
walk
she
had
taken
with
her
husband
was
knitting
winter
socks
for
oscar
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
monsieur
clapart
was
expecting
a
friend
named
poiret
who
often
came
in
to
play
dominoes
for
never
did
he
allow
himself
to
spend
an
evening
at
a
cafe
in
spite
of
the
prudent
economy
to
which
his
small
means
forced
him
clapart
would
not
have
answered
for
his
temperance
amid
a
luxury
of
food
and
in
presence
of
the
usual
guests
of
a
cafe
whose
inquisitive
observation
would
have
piqued
him
i
m
afraid
poiret
came
while
we
were
out
said
clapart
to
his
wife
why
no
my
friend
the
portress
would
have
told
us
so
when
we
came
in
replied
madame
clapart
she
may
have
forgotten
what
makes
you
think
so
it
wouldn
t
be
the
first
time
she
has
forgotten
things
for
us
for
god
knows
how
people
without
means
are
well
said
the
poor
woman
to
change
the
conversation
and
escape
clapart
s
cavilling
oscar
must
be
at
presles
by
this
time
how
he
will
enjoy
that
fine
house
and
the
beautiful
oh
yes
snarled
clapart
you
expect
fine
things
of
him
but
mark
my
words
there
ll
be
squabbles
wherever
he
will
you
never
cease
to
find
fault
with
that
poor
child
said
the
mother
what
has
he
done
to
you
if
some
day
we
should
live
at
our
ease
we
may
owe
it
all
to
him
he
has
such
a
good
heart
our
bones
will
be
jelly
long
before
that
fellow
makes
his
way
in
the
world
cried
clapart
you
don
t
know
your
own
child
he
is
conceited
boastful
deceitful
lazy
incapable
of
why
don
t
you
go
to
meet
poiret
said
the
poor
mother
struck
to
the
heart
by
the
diatribe
she
had
brought
upon
herself
a
boy
who
has
never
won
a
prize
at
school
continued
clapart
to
bourgeois
eyes
the
obtaining
of
school
prizes
means
the
certainty
of
a
fine
future
for
the
fortunate
child
did
you
win
any
asked
his
wife
oscar
stood
second
in
this
remark
imposed
silence
for
a
moment
on
clapart
but
presently
he
began
again
besides
madame
moreau
hates
him
like
poison
you
know
why
she
ll
try
to
set
her
husband
against
him
oscar
to
step
into
his
shoes
as
steward
of
presles
why
he
d
have
to
learn
agriculture
and
know
how
to
he
can
he
that
pussy
cat
i
ll
bet
that
if
he
does
get
a
place
down
there
it
won
t
be
a
week
before
he
does
some
doltish
thing
which
will
make
the
count
dismiss
good
god
how
can
you
be
so
bitter
against
a
poor
child
who
is
full
of
good
qualities
as
an
angel
incapable
of
doing
harm
to
any
one
no
matter
just
then
the
cracking
of
a
postilion
s
whip
and
the
noise
of
a
carriage
stopping
before
the
house
was
heard
this
arrival
having
apparently
put
the
whole
street
into
a
commotion
clapart
who
heard
the
opening
of
many
windows
looked
out
himself
to
see
what
was
happening
they
have
sent
oscar
back
to
you
in
a
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
though
in
truth
he
felt
inwardly
uneasy
good
heavens
what
can
have
happened
to
him
cried
the
poor
mother
trembling
like
a
leaf
shaken
by
the
autumn
wind
brochon
here
came
up
followed
by
oscar
and
poiret
what
has
happened
repeated
the
mother
addressing
the
i
don
t
know
but
monsieur
moreau
is
no
longer
steward
of
presles
and
they
say
your
son
has
caused
it
his
excellency
ordered
that
he
should
be
sent
home
to
you
here
s
a
letter
from
poor
monsieur
moreau
madame
which
will
tell
you
all
you
never
saw
a
man
so
changed
in
a
single
clapart
two
glasses
of
wine
for
the
postilion
and
for
monsieur
cried
the
mother
flinging
herself
into
a
chair
that
she
might
read
the
fatal
letter
oscar
she
said
staggering
towards
her
bed
do
you
want
to
kill
your
mother
after
all
the
cautions
i
gave
you
this
morning
she
did
not
end
her
sentence
for
she
fainted
from
distress
of
mind
when
she
came
to
herself
she
heard
her
husband
saying
to
oscar
as
he
shook
him
by
the
arm
will
you
answer
me
go
to
bed
monsieur
she
said
to
her
son
let
him
alone
monsieur
clapart
don
t
drive
him
out
of
his
senses
he
is
frightfully
oscar
did
not
hear
his
mother
s
last
words
he
had
slipped
away
to
bed
the
instant
that
he
got
the
order
those
who
remember
their
youth
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
after
a
day
so
filled
with
events
and
emotions
oscar
in
spite
of
the
enormity
of
his
offences
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
next
day
he
did
not
find
the
world
so
changed
as
he
thought
it
he
was
surprised
to
be
very
hungry
he
who
the
night
before
had
regarded
himself
as
unworthy
to
live
he
had
only
suffered
mentally
at
his
age
mental
impressions
succeed
each
other
so
rapidly
that
the
last
weakens
its
predecessor
however
deeply
the
first
may
have
been
cut
in
for
this
reason
corporal
punishment
though
philanthropists
are
deeply
opposed
to
it
in
these
days
becomes
necessary
in
certain
cases
for
certain
children
it
is
moreover
the
most
natural
form
of
retribution
for
nature
herself
employs
it
she
uses
pain
to
impress
a
lasting
memory
of
her
precepts
if
to
the
shame
of
the
preceding
evening
unhappily
too
transient
the
steward
had
joined
some
personal
chastisement
perhaps
the
lesson
might
have
been
complete
the
discernment
with
which
such
punishment
needs
to
be
administered
is
the
greatest
argument
against
it
nature
is
never
mistaken
but
the
teacher
is
and
frequently
madame
clapart
took
pains
to
send
her
husband
out
so
that
she
might
be
alone
with
her
son
the
next
morning
she
was
in
a
state
to
excite
pity
her
eyes
worn
with
tears
her
face
weary
with
the
fatigue
of
a
sleepless
night
her
feeble
voice
in
short
everything
about
her
proved
an
excess
of
suffering
she
could
not
have
borne
a
second
time
and
appealed
to
sympathy
when
oscar
entered
the
room
she
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
reminded
him
in
a
gentle
but
grieved
voice
of
the
benefits
they
had
so
constantly
received
from
the
steward
of
presles
she
told
him
that
they
had
lived
especially
for
the
last
six
years
on
the
delicate
charity
of
monsieur
moreau
and
that
monsieur
clapart
s
salary
also
the
or
scholarship
by
which
he
oscar
had
obtained
an
education
was
due
to
the
comte
de
serizy
most
of
this
would
now
cease
monsieur
clapart
she
said
had
no
claim
to
a
pension
his
period
of
service
not
being
long
enough
to
obtain
one
on
the
day
when
he
was
no
longer
able
to
keep
his
place
what
would
become
of
them
for
myself
she
said
by
nursing
the
sick
or
living
as
a
housekeeper
in
some
great
family
i
could
support
myself
and
monsieur
clapart
but
you
oscar
what
could
you
do
you
have
no
means
and
you
must
earn
some
for
you
must
live
there
are
but
four
careers
for
a
young
man
like
you
commerce
government
employment
the
licensed
professions
or
military
service
all
forms
of
commerce
need
capital
and
we
have
none
to
give
you
in
place
of
capital
a
young
man
can
only
give
devotion
and
his
capacity
but
commerce
also
demands
the
utmost
discretion
and
your
conduct
yesterday
proves
that
you
lack
it
to
enter
a
government
office
you
must
go
through
a
long
probation
by
the
help
of
influence
and
you
have
just
alienated
the
only
protector
that
we
had
a
most
powerful
one
besides
suppose
you
were
to
meet
with
some
extraordinary
help
by
which
a
young
man
makes
his
way
promptly
either
in
business
or
in
the
public
employ
where
could
you
find
the
money
to
live
and
clothe
yourself
during
the
time
that
you
are
learning
your
employment
here
the
mother
wandered
like
other
women
into
wordy
lamentation
what
should
she
do
now
to
feed
the
family
deprived
of
the
benefits
moreau
s
stewardship
had
enabled
him
to
send
her
from
presles
oscar
had
overthrown
his
benefactor
s
prosperity
as
commerce
and
a
government
clerkship
were
now
impossible
there
remained
only
the
professions
of
notary
and
lawyer
either
barristers
or
solicitors
and
sheriffs
but
for
those
he
must
study
at
least
three
years
and
pay
considerable
sums
for
entrance
fees
examinations
certificates
and
diplomas
and
here
again
the
question
of
maintenance
presented
itself
oscar
she
said
in
conclusion
in
you
i
had
put
all
my
pride
all
my
life
in
accepting
for
myself
an
unhappy
old
age
i
fastened
my
eyes
on
you
i
saw
you
with
the
prospect
of
a
fine
career
and
i
imagined
you
succeeding
in
it
that
thought
that
hope
gave
me
courage
to
face
the
privations
i
have
endured
for
six
years
in
order
to
carry
you
through
school
where
you
have
cost
me
in
spite
of
the
scholarship
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
now
that
my
hope
is
vanishing
your
future
terrifies
me
i
can
not
take
one
penny
from
monsieur
clapart
s
salary
for
my
son
what
can
you
do
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
mathematics
to
enter
any
of
the
technical
schools
and
besides
where
could
i
get
the
three
thousand
francs
which
they
extract
this
is
life
as
it
is
my
child
you
are
eighteen
you
are
strong
enlist
in
the
army
it
is
your
only
means
that
i
can
see
to
earn
your
oscar
knew
as
yet
nothing
whatever
of
life
like
all
children
who
have
been
kept
from
a
knowledge
of
the
trials
and
poverty
of
the
home
he
was
ignorant
of
the
necessity
of
earning
his
living
the
word
commerce
presented
no
idea
whatever
to
his
mind
public
employment
said
almost
as
little
for
he
saw
no
results
of
it
he
listened
therefore
with
a
submissive
air
which
he
tried
to
make
humble
to
his
mother
s
exhortations
but
they
were
lost
in
the
void
and
did
not
reach
his
mind
nevertheless
the
word
army
the
thought
of
being
a
soldier
and
the
sight
of
his
mother
s
tears
did
at
last
make
him
cry
no
sooner
did
madame
clapart
see
the
drops
coursing
down
his
cheeks
than
she
felt
herself
helpless
and
like
most
mothers
in
such
cases
she
began
the
peroration
which
terminates
these
scenes
scenes
in
which
they
suffer
their
own
anguish
and
that
of
their
children
also
well
oscar
me
that
you
will
be
more
discreet
in
future
that
you
will
not
talk
heedlessly
any
more
but
will
strive
to
repress
your
silly
vanity
et
cetera
et
cetera
oscar
of
course
promised
all
his
mother
asked
him
to
promise
and
then
after
gently
drawing
him
to
her
madame
clapart
ended
by
kissing
him
to
console
him
for
being
scolded
in
future
she
said
you
will
listen
to
your
mother
and
will
follow
her
advice
for
a
mother
can
give
nothing
but
good
counsel
to
her
child
we
will
go
and
see
your
uncle
cardot
that
is
our
last
hope
cardot
owed
a
great
deal
to
your
father
who
gave
him
his
sister
mademoiselle
husson
with
an
enormous
dowry
for
those
days
which
enabled
him
to
make
a
large
fortune
in
the
silk
trade
i
think
he
might
perhaps
place
you
with
monsieur
camusot
his
successor
and
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
but
you
see
your
uncle
cardot
has
four
children
he
gave
his
establishment
the
cocon
d
or
to
his
eldest
daughter
madame
camusot
and
though
camusot
has
millions
he
has
also
four
children
by
two
wives
and
besides
he
scarcely
knows
of
our
existence
cardot
has
married
his
second
daughter
mariane
to
monsieur
protez
of
the
firm
of
protez
and
chiffreville
the
practice
of
his
eldest
son
the
notary
cost
him
four
hundred
thousand
francs
and
he
has
just
put
his
second
son
joseph
into
the
drug
business
of
matifat
so
you
see
your
uncle
cardot
has
many
reasons
not
to
take
an
interest
in
you
whom
he
sees
only
four
times
a
year
he
has
never
come
to
call
upon
me
here
though
he
was
ready
enough
to
visit
me
at
madame
mere
s
when
he
wanted
to
sell
his
silks
to
the
emperor
the
imperial
highnesses
and
all
the
great
people
at
court
but
now
the
camusots
have
turned
ultras
the
eldest
son
of
camusot
s
first
wife
married
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
king
s
ushers
the
world
is
mighty
when
it
stoops
however
it
was
a
clever
thing
to
do
for
the
cocon
d
or
has
the
custom
of
the
present
court
as
it
had
that
of
the
emperor
but
we
will
go
and
see
your
uncle
cardot
and
i
hope
that
you
will
endeavor
to
behave
properly
for
as
i
said
before
and
i
repeat
it
that
is
our
last
monsieur
cardot
had
been
a
widower
six
years
as
of
the
cocon
d
or
one
of
the
oldest
firms
in
paris
he
had
bought
the
establishment
in
at
a
time
when
the
heads
of
the
house
were
ruined
by
the
maximum
and
the
money
of
mademoiselle
husson
s
dowry
had
enabled
him
to
do
this
and
so
make
a
fortune
that
was
almost
colossal
in
ten
years
to
establish
his
children
richly
during
his
lifetime
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
buying
an
annuity
for
himself
and
his
wife
with
three
hundred
thousand
francs
which
gave
him
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
he
then
divided
his
capital
into
three
shares
of
four
hundred
thousand
francs
each
which
he
gave
to
three
of
his
children
the
cocon
d
or
given
to
his
eldest
daughter
on
her
marriage
being
the
equivalent
of
a
fourth
share
thus
the
worthy
man
who
was
now
nearly
seventy
years
old
could
spend
his
thirty
thousand
a
year
as
he
pleased
without
feeling
that
he
injured
the
prospects
of
his
children
all
finely
provided
for
whose
attentions
and
proofs
of
affection
were
moreover
not
prompted
by
uncle
cardot
lived
at
belleville
in
one
of
the
first
houses
above
the
courtille
he
there
occupied
on
the
first
floor
an
apartment
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
seine
with
a
southern
exposure
and
the
exclusive
enjoyment
of
a
large
garden
for
the
sum
of
a
thousand
francs
a
year
he
troubled
himself
not
at
all
about
the
three
or
four
other
tenants
of
the
same
vast
certain
through
a
long
lease
of
ending
his
days
there
he
lived
rather
plainly
served
by
an
old
cook
and
the
former
maid
of
the
late
madame
cardot
both
of
whom
expected
to
reap
an
annuity
of
some
six
hundred
francs
apiece
on
the
old
man
s
death
these
two
women
took
the
utmost
care
of
him
and
were
all
the
more
interested
in
doing
so
because
no
one
was
ever
less
fussy
or
less
than
he
the
apartment
furnished
by
the
late
madame
cardot
had
remained
in
the
same
condition
for
the
last
six
years
the
old
man
being
perfectly
contented
with
it
he
spent
in
all
not
more
than
three
thousand
francs
a
year
there
for
he
dined
in
paris
five
days
in
the
week
and
returned
home
at
midnight
in
a
which
belonged
to
an
establishment
at
courtille
the
cook
had
only
her
master
s
breakfast
to
provide
on
those
days
this
was
served
at
eleven
o
clock
after
that
he
dressed
and
perfumed
himself
and
departed
for
paris
usually
a
bourgeois
gives
notice
in
the
household
if
he
dines
out
old
cardot
on
the
contrary
gave
notice
when
he
dined
at
home
this
little
old
man
fat
rosy
squat
and
strong
always
looked
in
popular
speech
as
if
he
had
stepped
from
a
bandbox
he
appeared
in
black
silk
stockings
breeches
of
paduasoy
a
white
pique
waistcoat
dazzling
a
coat
violet
silk
gloves
gold
buckles
to
his
shoes
and
his
breeches
and
lastly
a
touch
of
powder
and
a
little
queue
tied
with
black
ribbon
his
face
was
remarkable
for
a
pair
of
eyebrows
as
thick
as
bushes
beneath
which
sparkled
his
gray
eyes
and
for
a
square
nose
thick
and
long
which
gave
him
somewhat
the
air
of
the
abbes
of
former
times
his
countenance
did
not
belie
him
pere
cardot
belonged
to
that
race
of
lively
gerontes
which
is
now
disappearing
rapidly
though
it
once
served
as
turcarets
to
the
comedies
and
tales
of
the
eighteenth
century
uncle
cardot
always
said
fair
lady
and
he
placed
in
their
carriages
and
otherwise
paid
attention
to
those
women
whom
he
saw
without
protectors
he
placed
himself
at
their
disposition
as
he
said
in
his
chivalrous
way
but
beneath
his
calm
air
and
his
snowy
poll
he
concealed
an
old
age
almost
wholly
given
up
to
mere
pleasure
among
men
he
openly
professed
epicureanism
and
gave
himself
the
license
of
free
talk
he
had
seen
no
harm
in
the
devotion
of
his
camusot
to
mademoiselle
coralie
for
he
himself
was
secretly
the
mecaenas
of
mademoiselle
florentine
the
first
danseuse
at
the
gaiete
but
this
life
and
these
opinions
never
appeared
in
his
own
home
nor
in
his
external
conduct
before
the
world
uncle
cardot
grave
and
polite
was
thought
to
be
somewhat
cold
so
much
did
he
affect
decorum
a
devote
would
have
called
him
a
hypocrite
the
worthy
old
gentleman
hated
priests
he
belonged
to
that
great
flock
of
ninnies
who
subscribed
to
the
constitutionnel
and
was
much
concerned
about
refusals
to
he
adored
voltaire
though
his
preferences
were
really
for
piron
vade
and
colle
naturally
he
admired
beranger
whom
he
wittily
called
the
grandfather
of
the
religion
of
his
daughters
madame
camusot
and
madame
protez
and
his
two
sons
would
to
use
a
popular
expression
have
been
flabbergasted
if
any
one
had
explained
to
them
what
their
father
meant
by
singing
la
mere
this
parent
had
never
mentioned
his
income
to
his
children
who
seeing
that
he
lived
in
a
cheap
way
reflected
that
he
had
deprived
himself
of
his
property
for
their
sakes
and
therefore
redoubled
their
attentions
and
tenderness
in
fact
he
would
sometimes
say
to
his
sons
don
t
lose
your
property
remember
i
have
none
to
leave
camusot
in
whom
he
recognized
a
certain
likeness
to
his
own
nature
and
whom
he
liked
enough
to
make
a
sharer
in
his
secret
pleasures
alone
knew
of
the
thirty
thousand
a
year
annuity
but
camusot
approved
of
the
old
man
s
ethics
and
thought
that
having
made
the
happiness
of
his
children
and
nobly
fulfilled
his
duty
by
them
he
now
had
a
right
to
end
his
life
jovially
don
t
you
see
my
friend
said
the
former
master
of
the
cocon
d
or
i
might
a
young
woman
would
give
me
more
children
well
florentine
doesn
t
cost
me
what
a
wife
would
neither
does
she
bore
me
and
she
won
t
give
me
children
to
lessen
your
camusot
considered
that
pere
cardot
gave
expression
to
a
high
sense
of
family
duty
in
these
words
he
regarded
him
as
an
admirable
he
knows
thought
he
how
to
unite
the
interests
of
his
children
with
the
pleasures
which
old
age
naturally
desires
after
the
worries
of
business
neither
the
cardots
nor
the
camusots
nor
the
protez
knew
anything
of
the
ways
of
life
of
their
aunt
clapart
the
family
intercourse
was
restricted
to
the
sending
of
notes
of
faire
part
on
the
occasion
of
deaths
and
marriages
and
cards
at
the
new
year
the
proud
madame
clapart
would
never
have
brought
herself
to
seek
them
were
it
not
for
oscar
s
interests
and
because
of
her
friendship
for
moreau
the
only
person
who
had
been
faithful
to
her
in
misfortune
she
had
never
annoyed
old
cardot
by
her
visits
or
her
importunities
but
she
held
to
him
as
to
a
hope
and
always
went
to
see
him
once
every
three
months
and
talked
to
him
of
oscar
the
nephew
of
the
late
respectable
madame
cardot
and
she
took
the
boy
to
call
upon
him
three
times
during
each
vacation
at
each
of
these
visits
the
old
gentleman
had
given
oscar
a
dinner
at
the
taking
him
afterwards
to
the
gaiete
and
returning
him
safely
to
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
on
one
occasion
having
given
the
boy
an
entirely
new
suit
of
clothes
he
added
the
silver
cup
and
fork
and
spoon
required
for
his
school
outfit
oscar
s
mother
endeavored
to
impress
the
old
gentleman
with
the
idea
that
his
nephew
cherished
him
and
she
constantly
referred
to
the
cup
and
the
fork
and
spoon
and
to
the
beautiful
suit
of
clothes
though
nothing
was
then
left
of
the
latter
but
the
waistcoat
but
such
little
arts
did
oscar
more
harm
than
good
when
practised
on
so
sly
an
old
fox
as
uncle
cardot
the
latter
had
never
much
liked
his
departed
wife
a
tall
spare
woman
he
was
also
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
the
late
husson
s
marriage
with
oscar
s
mother
and
without
in
the
least
condemning
her
he
knew
very
well
that
oscar
was
a
posthumous
child
his
nephew
therefore
seemed
to
him
to
have
no
claims
on
the
cardot
family
but
madame
clapart
like
all
women
who
concentrate
their
whole
being
into
the
sentiment
of
motherhood
did
not
put
herself
in
cardot
s
place
and
see
the
matter
from
his
point
of
view
she
thought
he
must
certainly
be
interested
in
so
sweet
a
child
who
bore
the
maiden
name
of
his
late
wife
monsieur
said
old
cardot
s
coming
out
to
him
as
he
walked
about
the
garden
while
awaiting
his
breakfast
after
his
hairdresser
had
duly
shaved
him
and
powdered
his
queue
the
mother
of
your
nephew
oscar
is
fair
lady
said
the
old
man
bowing
to
madame
clapart
and
wrapping
his
white
pique
about
him
hey
hey
how
this
little
fellow
grows
he
added
taking
oscar
by
the
ear
he
has
finished
school
and
he
regretted
so
much
that
his
dear
uncle
was
not
present
at
the
distribution
of
the
henri
iv
prizes
at
which
he
was
named
the
name
of
husson
which
let
us
hope
he
will
bear
worthily

proclaimed

deuce

was
exclaimed
the
little
old
man
stopping
short
madame
clapart
oscar
and
he
were
walking
along
a
terrace
flanked
by
oranges
myrtles
and
pomegranates
and
what
did
he
get
the
fourth
rank
in
philosophy
replied
the
mother
proudly
oh
oh
cried
uncle
cardot
the
rascal
has
a
good
deal
to
do
to
make
up
for
lost
time
for
the
fourth
rank
in
philosophy
well
isn
t
you
know
you
will
stay
and
breakfast
with
me
he
added
we
are
at
your
orders
replied
madame
clapart
ah
my
dear
monsieur
cardot
what
happiness
it
is
for
fathers
and
mothers
when
their
children
make
a
good
start
in
life
in
this
respect
indeed
in
all
others
she
added
catching
herself
up

most
fortunate

leave

and
look
at
the
garden
but
don
t
touch
the
why
he
s
eighteen
years
old
said
uncle
cardot
smiling
at
this
injunction
which
made
an
infant
of
oscar
alas
yes
he
is
eighteen
my
good
monsieur
cardot
and
after
bringing
him
so
far
sound
and
healthy
in
mind
and
body
neither
nor
crooked
after
sacrificing
everything
to
give
him
an
education
it
would
be
hard
if
i
could
not
see
him
on
the
road
to
that
monsieur
moreau
who
got
him
the
scholarship
will
be
sure
to
look
after
his
career
said
uncle
cardot
concealing
his
hypocrisy
under
an
air
of
friendly
monsieur
moreau
may
die
she
said
and
besides
he
has
quarrelled
irrevocably
with
the
comte
de
serizy
his
the
deuce
he
has
listen
madame
i
see
you
are
about
to
no
monsieur
said
oscar
s
mother
interrupting
the
old
man
who
out
of
courtesy
to
the
fair
lady
repressed
his
annoyance
at
being
interrupted
alas
you
do
not
know
the
miseries
of
a
mother
who
for
seven
years
past
has
been
forced
to
take
a
sum
of
six
hundred
francs
a
year
for
her
son
s
education
from
the
miserable
eighteen
hundred
francs
of
her
husband
s
salary
yes
monsieur
that
is
all
we
have
had
to
live
upon
therefore
what
more
can
i
do
for
my
poor
oscar
monsieur
clapart
so
hates
the
child
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
keep
him
in
the
house
a
poor
woman
alone
in
the
world
am
i
not
right
to
come
and
consult
the
only
relation
my
oscar
has
under
heaven
yes
you
are
right
said
uncle
cardot
you
never
told
me
of
all
this
ah
monsieur
replied
madame
clapart
proudly
you
were
the
last
to
whom
i
would
have
told
my
wretchedness
it
is
all
my
own
fault
i
married
a
man
whose
incapacity
is
almost
beyond
belief
yes
i
am
indeed
most
listen
to
me
madame
said
the
little
old
man
and
don
t
weep
it
is
most
painful
to
me
to
see
a
fair
lady
cry
after
all
your
son
bears
the
name
of
husson
and
if
my
dear
deceased
wife
were
living
she
would
wish
to
do
something
for
the
name
of
her
father
and
of
her
brother
she
loved
her
brother
said
oscar
s
mother
but
all
my
fortune
is
given
to
my
children
who
expect
nothing
from
me
at
my
death
continued
the
old
man
i
have
divided
among
them
the
millions
that
i
had
because
i
wanted
to
see
them
happy
and
enjoying
their
wealth
during
my
lifetime
i
have
nothing
now
except
an
annuity
and
at
my
age
one
clings
to
old
habits
do
you
know
the
path
on
which
you
ought
to
start
this
young
fellow
he
went
on
after
calling
to
oscar
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
let

do
you
hear
that
oscar
said
his
mother
your
uncle
sums
up
in
three
words
all
that
i
have
been
saying
to
you
you
ought
to
carve
the
last
word
in
letters
of
fire
on
your
oh
i
have
said
oscar
very
good
then
thank
your
uncle
didn
t
you
hear
him
say
he
would
take
charge
of
your
future
you
will
be
a
lawyer
in
he
doesn
t
see
the
grandeur
of
his
destiny
said
the
little
old
man
observing
oscar
s
apathetic
air
well
he
s
just
out
of
school
listen
i
m
no
talker
he
continued
but
i
have
this
to
say
remember
that
at
your
age
honesty
and
uprightness
are
maintained
only
by
resisting
temptations
of
which
in
a
great
city
like
paris
there
are
many
at
every
step
live
in
your
mother
s
home
in
the
garret
go
straight
to
the
from
there
to
your
lawyer
s
office
drudge
night
and
day
and
study
at
home
become
by
the
time
you
are
a
second
clerk
by
the
time
you
are
be
steady
and
you
will
win
all
if
moreover
you
shouldn
t
like
the
profession
you
might
enter
the
office
of
my
son
the
notary
and
eventually
succeed
him
therefore
work
patience
discretion
honesty
those
are
your
god
grant
that
you
may
live
thirty
years
longer
to
see
your
fifth
child
realizing
all
we
expect
from
him
cried
madame
clapart
seizing
uncle
cardot
s
hand
and
pressing
it
with
a
gesture
that
recalled
her
youth
now
come
to
breakfast
replied
the
kind
old
man
leading
oscar
by
the
ear
during
the
meal
uncle
cardot
observed
his
nephew
without
appearing
to
do
so
and
soon
saw
that
the
lad
knew
nothing
of
life
send
him
here
to
me
now
and
then
he
said
to
madame
clapart
as
he
bade
her
and
i
ll
form
him
for
this
visit
calmed
the
anxieties
of
the
poor
mother
who
had
not
hoped
for
such
brilliant
success
for
the
next
fortnight
she
took
oscar
to
walk
daily
and
watched
him
tyrannically
this
brought
matters
to
the
end
of
october
one
morning
as
the
poor
household
was
breakfasting
on
a
salad
of
herring
and
lettuce
with
milk
for
a
dessert
oscar
beheld
with
terror
the
formidable
who
entered
the
room
and
surprised
this
scene
of
poverty
we
are
now
living
in
paris
but
not
as
we
lived
at
presles
said
moreau
wishing
to
make
known
to
madame
clapart
the
change
in
their
relations
caused
by
oscar
s
folly
i
shall
seldom
be
here
myself
for
i
have
gone
into
partnership
with
pere
leger
and
pere
margueron
of
beaumont
we
are
speculating
in
land
and
we
have
begun
by
purchasing
the
estate
of
persan
i
am
the
head
of
the
concern
which
has
a
capital
of
a
million
part
of
which
i
have
borrowed
on
my
own
securities
when
i
find
a
good
thing
pere
leger
and
i
examine
it
my
partners
have
each
a
quarter
and
i
a
half
in
the
profits
but
i
do
nearly
all
the
work
and
for
that
reason
i
shall
be
constantly
on
the
road
my
wife
lives
here
in
the
faubourg
du
roule
very
plainly
when
we
see
how
the
business
turns
out
if
we
risk
only
the
profits
and
if
oscar
behaves
himself
we
may
perhaps
employ
ah
my
friend
the
catastrophe
caused
by
my
poor
boy
s
heedlessness
may
prove
to
be
the
cause
of
your
making
a
brilliant
fortune
for
really
and
truly
you
were
burying
your
energy
and
your
capacity
at
madame
clapart
then
went
on
to
relate
her
visit
to
uncle
cardot
in
order
to
show
moreau
that
neither
she
nor
her
son
need
any
longer
be
a
burden
on
him
he
is
right
that
old
fellow
said
the
we
must
hold
oscar
in
that
path
with
an
iron
hand
and
he
will
end
as
a
barrister
or
a
notary
but
he
mustn
t
leave
the
track
he
must
go
straight
through
with
it
ha
i
know
how
to
help
you
the
legal
business
of
is
quite
important
and
i
have
heard
of
a
lawyer
who
has
just
bought
what
is
called
a
titre
nu
that
means
a
practice
without
clients
he
is
a
young
man
hard
as
an
iron
bar
eager
for
work
ferociously
active
his
name
is
desroches
i
ll
offer
him
our
business
on
condition
that
he
takes
oscar
as
a
pupil
and
i
ll
ask
him
to
let
the
boy
live
with
him
at
nine
hundred
francs
a
year
of
which
i
will
pay
three
so
that
your
son
will
cost
you
only
six
hundred
francs
without
his
living
in
future
if
the
boy
ever
means
to
become
a
man
it
can
only
be
under
a
discipline
like
that
he
ll
come
out
of
that
office
notary
solicitor
or
barrister
as
he
may
come
oscar
thank
our
kind
monsieur
moreau
and
don
t
stand
there
like
a
stone
post
all
young
men
who
commit
follies
have
not
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
friends
who
still
take
an
interest
in
their
career
even
after
they
have
been
injured
by
the
best
way
to
make
your
peace
with
me
said
moreau
pressing
oscar
s
hand
is
to
work
now
with
steady
application
and
to
conduct
yourself
in

ten
days
later
oscar
was
taken
by
monsieur
moreau
to
maitre
desroches
solicitor
recently
established
in
the
rue
de
bethisy
in
a
vast
apartment
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
for
which
he
was
paying
a
relatively
low
price
desroches
a
young
man
years
of
age
born
of
poor
parents
and
brought
up
with
extreme
severity
by
a
stern
father
had
himself
known
the
condition
in
which
oscar
now
was
accordingly
he
felt
an
interest
in
him
but
the
sort
of
interest
which
alone
he
could
take
checked
by
the
apparent
harshness
that
characterized
him
the
aspect
of
this
gaunt
young
man
with
a
muddy
skin
and
hair
cropped
like
a
who
was
curt
of
speech
and
possessed
a
piercing
eye
and
a
gloomy
vivaciousness
terrified
the
unhappy
oscar
we
work
here
day
and
night
said
the
lawyer
from
the
depths
of
his
armchair
and
behind
a
table
on
which
were
papers
piled
up
like
alps
monsieur
moreau
we
won
t
kill
him
but
he
ll
have
to
go
at
our
pace
monsieur
godeschal
he
called
out
though
the
day
was
sunday
the
appeared
pen
in
hand
monsieur
godeschal
here
s
the
pupil
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
monsieur
moreau
takes
the
liveliest
interest
in
him
he
will
dine
with
us
and
sleep
in
the
small
attic
next
to
your
chamber
you
will
allot
the
exact
time
it
takes
to
go
to
the
and
back
so
that
he
does
not
lose
five
minutes
on
the
way
you
will
see
that
he
learns
the
code
and
is
proficient
in
his
classes
that
is
to
say
after
he
has
done
his
work
here
you
will
give
him
authors
to
read
in
short
he
is
to
be
under
your
immediate
direction
and
i
shall
keep
an
eye
on
it
they
want
to
make
him
what
you
have
made
yourself
a
capable
against
the
time
when
he
can
take
such
a
place
himself
go
with
monsieur
godeschal
my
young
friend
he
ll
show
you
your
lodging
and
you
can
settle
down
in
it
did
you
notice
godeschal
continued
desroches
speaking
to
moreau
there
s
a
fellow
who
like
me
has
nothing
his
sister
mariette
the
famous
danseuse
is
laying
up
her
money
to
buy
him
a
practice
in
ten
years
my
clerks
are
young
blades
who
have
nothing
but
their
ten
fingers
to
rely
upon
so
we
all
my
five
clerks
and
i
work
as
hard
as
a
dozen
ordinary
fellows
but
in
ten
years
i
ll
have
the
finest
practice
in
paris
in
my
office
business
and
clients
are
a
passion
and
that
s
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
i
took
godeschal
from
derville
where
he
was
only
just
made
second
clerk
he
gets
a
thousand
francs
a
year
from
me
and
food
and
lodging
but
he
s
worth
it
he
is
indefatigable
i
love
him
that
fellow
he
has
managed
to
live
as
i
did
when
a
clerk
on
six
hundred
francs
a
year
what
i
care
for
above
all
is
honesty
spotless
integrity
and
when
it
is
practised
in
such
poverty
as
that
a
man
s
a
man
for
the
slightest
fault
of
that
kind
a
clerk
leaves
my
the
lad
is
in
a
good
school
thought
moreau
for
two
whole
years
oscar
lived
in
the
rue
de
bethisy
a
den
of
pettifogging
for
if
ever
that
superannuated
expression
was
applicable
to
a
lawyer
s
office
it
was
so
in
this
case
under
this
supervision
both
petty
and
able
he
was
kept
to
his
regular
hours
and
to
his
work
with
such
rigidity
that
his
life
in
the
midst
of
paris
was
that
of
a
monk
at
five
in
the
morning
in
all
weathers
godeschal
woke
up
he
went
down
with
oscar
to
the
office
where
they
always
found
their
master
up
and
working
oscar
then
did
the
errands
of
the
office
and
prepared
his
lessons
for
the
and
prepared
them
elaborately
for
godeschal
and
frequently
desroches
himself
pointed
out
to
their
pupil
authors
to
be
looked
through
and
difficulties
to
overcome
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
a
single
section
of
the
code
until
he
had
thoroughly
mastered
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
chief
and
godeschal
who
put
him
through
preliminary
examinations
more
searching
and
longer
than
those
of
the
on
his
return
from
his
classes
where
he
was
kept
but
a
short
time
he
went
to
his
work
in
the
office
occasionally
he
was
sent
to
the
palais
but
always
under
the
thumb
of
the
rigid
godeschal
till
dinner
the
dinner
was
that
of
his
master
one
dish
of
meat
one
of
vegetables
and
a
salad
the
dessert
consisted
of
a
piece
of
gruyere
cheese
after
dinner
godeschal
and
oscar
returned
to
the
office
and
worked
till
night
once
a
month
oscar
went
to
breakfast
with
his
uncle
cardot
and
he
spent
the
sundays
with
his
mother
from
time
to
time
moreau
when
he
came
to
the
office
about
his
own
affairs
would
take
oscar
to
dine
in
the
and
to
some
theatre
in
the
evening
oscar
had
been
so
snubbed
by
godeschal
and
by
desroches
for
his
attempts
at
elegance
that
he
no
longer
gave
a
thought
to
his
clothes
a
good
clerk
godeschal
told
him
should
have
two
black
coats
one
new
one
old
a
pair
of
black
trousers
black
stockings
and
shoes
boots
cost
too
much
you
can
t
have
boots
till
you
are
called
to
the
bar
a
clerk
should
never
spend
more
than
seven
hundred
francs
a
year
good
stout
shirts
of
strong
linen
are
what
you
want
ha
when
a
man
starts
from
nothing
to
reach
fortune
he
has
to
keep
down
to
bare
necessities
look
at
monsieur
desroches
he
did
what
we
are
doing
and
see
where
he
is
godeschal
preached
by
example
if
he
professed
the
strictest
principles
of
honor
discretion
and
honesty
he
practised
them
without
assumption
as
he
walked
as
he
breathed
such
action
was
the
natural
play
of
his
soul
as
walking
and
breathing
were
the
natural
play
of
his
organs
eighteen
months
after
oscar
s
installation
into
the
office
the
second
clerk
was
for
the
second
time
slightly
wrong
in
his
accounts
which
were
comparatively
unimportant
godeschal
said
to
him
in
presence
of
all
the
other
clerks
my
dear
gaudet
go
away
from
here
of
your
own
free
will
that
it
may
not
be
said
that
monsieur
desroches
has
dismissed
you
you
have
been
careless
or
and
neither
of
those
defects
can
pass
here
the
master
shall
know
nothing
about
the
matter
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
for
a
at
twenty
years
of
age
oscar
became
third
clerk
in
the
office
though
he
earned
no
salary
he
was
lodged
and
fed
for
he
did
the
work
of
the
second
clerk
desroches
employed
two
chief
clerks
and
the
work
of
the
second
was
unremitting
toil
by
the
end
of
his
second
year
in
the
oscar
knew
more
than
most
licensed
graduates
he
did
the
work
at
the
palais
intelligently
and
argued
some
cases
in
chambers
godeschal
and
desroches
were
satisfied
with
him
and
yet
though
he
now
seemed
a
sensible
man
he
showed
from
time
to
time
a
hankering
after
pleasure
and
a
desire
to
shine
repressed
though
it
was
by
the
stern
discipline
and
continual
toil
of
his
life
moreau
satisfied
with
oscar
s
progress
relaxed
in
some
degree
his
watchfulness
and
when
in
july
oscar
passed
his
examinations
with
a
spotless
record
the
gave
him
the
money
to
dress
himself
elegantly
madame
clapart
proud
and
happy
in
her
son
prepared
the
outfit
splendidly
for
the
rising
lawyer
in
the
month
of
november
when
the
courts
reopened
oscar
husson
occupied
the
chamber
of
the
second
clerk
whose
work
he
now
did
wholly
he
had
a
salary
of
eight
hundred
francs
with
board
and
lodging
consequently
uncle
cardot
who
went
privately
to
desroches
and
made
inquiries
about
his
nephew
promised
madame
clapart
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
practice
for
oscar
if
he
continued
to
do
as
well
in
the
future
in
spite
of
these
virtuous
appearances
oscar
husson
was
undergoing
a
great
strife
in
his
inmost
being
at
times
he
thought
of
quitting
a
life
so
directly
against
his
tastes
and
his
nature
he
felt
that
were
happier
than
he
galled
by
the
collar
of
this
iron
system
wild
desires
seized
him
to
fly
when
he
compared
himself
in
the
street
with
the
young
men
whom
he
met
sometimes
he
was
driven
by
a
sort
of
madness
towards
women
then
again
he
resigned
himself
but
only
to
fall
into
a
deeper
disgust
for
life
impelled
by
the
example
of
godeschal
he
was
forced
rather
than
led
of
himself
to
remain
in
that
rugged
way
godeschal
who
watched
and
took
note
of
oscar
made
it
a
matter
of
principle
not
to
allow
his
pupil
to
be
exposed
to
temptation
generally
the
young
clerk
was
without
money
or
had
so
little
that
he
could
not
if
he
would
give
way
to
excess
during
the
last
year
the
worthy
godeschal
had
made
five
or
six
parties
of
pleasure
with
oscar
defraying
the
expenses
for
he
felt
that
the
rope
by
which
he
tethered
the
young
kid
must
be
slackened
these
pranks
as
he
called
them
helped
oscar
to
endure
existence
for
there
was
little
amusement
in
breakfasting
with
his
uncle
cardot
and
still
less
in
going
to
see
his
mother
who
lived
even
more
penuriously
than
desroches
moreau
could
not
make
himself
familiar
with
oscar
as
godeschal
could
and
perhaps
that
sincere
friend
to
young
husson
was
behind
godeschal
in
these
efforts
to
initiate
the
poor
youth
safely
into
the
mysteries
of
life
oscar
grown
prudent
had
come
through
contact
with
others
to
see
the
extent
and
the
character
of
the
fault
he
had
committed
on
that
luckless
journey
but
the
volume
of
his
repressed
fancies
and
the
follies
of
youth
might
still
get
the
better
of
him
nevertheless
the
more
knowledge
he
could
get
of
the
world
and
its
laws
the
better
his
mind
would
form
itself
and
provided
godeschal
never
lost
sight
of
him
moreau
flattered
himself
that
between
them
they
could
bring
the
son
of
madame
clapart
through
in
safety
how
is
he
getting
on
asked
the
of
godeschal
on
his
return
from
one
of
his
journeys
which
had
kept
him
some
months
out
of
paris
always
too
much
vanity
replied
godeschal
you
give
him
fine
clothes
and
fine
linen
he
wears
the
of
a
stockbroker
and
so
my
dainty
coxcomb
spends
his
sundays
in
the
tuileries
looking
out
for
adventures
what
else
can
you
expect
that
s
youth
he
torments
me
to
present
him
to
my
sister
where
he
would
see
a
pretty
sort
of
society
actresses
elegant
young
fops
spendthrifts
who
are
wasting
their
fortunes
his
mind
i
m
afraid
is
not
fitted
for
law
he
can
talk
well
though
and
if
we
could
make
him
a
barrister
he
might
plead
cases
that
were
carefully
prepared
for
in
the
month
of
november
soon
after
oscar
husson
had
taken
possession
of
his
new
clerkship
and
at
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
pass
his
examination
for
the
licentiate
s
degree
a
new
clerk
arrived
to
take
the
place
made
vacant
by
oscar
s
promotion
this
fourth
clerk
named
frederic
marest
intended
to
enter
the
magistracy
and
was
now
in
his
third
year
at
the
law
school
he
was
a
fine
young
man
of
enriched
to
the
amount
of
some
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
by
the
death
of
a
bachelor
uncle
and
the
son
of
madame
marest
widow
of
the
wealthy
this
future
magistrate
actuated
by
a
laudable
desire
to
understand
his
vocation
in
its
smallest
details
had
put
himself
in
desroches
office
for
the
purpose
of
studying
legal
procedure
and
of
training
himself
to
take
a
place
as
in
two
years
he
hoped
to
do
his
stage
the
period
between
the
admission
as
licentiate
and
the
call
to
the
bar
in
paris
in
order
to
be
fully
prepared
for
the
functions
of
a
post
which
would
surely
not
be
refused
to
a
rich
young
man
to
see
himself
by
the
time
he
was
thirty
procureur
du
roi
in
any
court
no
matter
where
was
his
sole
ambition
though
frederic
marest
was
to
georges
marest
the
latter
not
having
told
his
surname
in
pierrotin
s
coucou
oscar
husson
did
not
connect
the
present
marest
with
the
grandson
of
messieurs
said
godeschal
at
breakfast
time
addressing
all
the
clerks
i
announce
to
you
the
arrival
of
a
new
jurisconsult
and
as
he
is
rich
rishissime
we
will
make
him
i
hope
pay
a
glorious
forward
the
book
cried
oscar
nodding
to
the
youngest
clerk
and
pray
let
us
be
the
youngest
clerk
climbed
like
a
squirrel
along
the
shelves
which
lined
the
room
until
he
could
reach
a
register
placed
on
the
top
shelf
where
a
thick
layer
of
dust
had
settled
on
it
it
is
getting
colored
said
the
little
clerk
exhibiting
the
volume
we
must
explain
the
perennial
joke
of
this
book
then
much
in
vogue
in
legal
offices
in
a
clerical
life
where
work
is
the
rule
amusement
is
all
the
more
treasured
because
it
is
rare
but
above
all
a
hoax
or
a
practical
joke
is
enjoyed
with
delight
this
fancy
or
custom
does
to
a
certain
extent
explain
georges
marest
s
behavior
in
the
coucou
the
gravest
and
most
gloomy
clerk
is
possessed
at
times
with
a
craving
for
fun
and
quizzing
the
instinct
with
which
a
set
of
young
clerks
will
seize
and
develop
a
hoax
or
a
practical
joke
is
really
marvellous
the
denizens
of
a
studio
and
of
a
lawyer
s
office
are
in
this
line
superior
to
comedians
in
buying
a
practice
without
clients
desroches
began
as
it
were
a
new
dynasty
this
circumstance
made
a
break
in
the
usages
relative
to
the
reception
of
moreover
desroches
having
taken
an
office
where
legal
documents
had
never
yet
been
scribbled
had
bought
new
tables
and
white
boxes
edged
with
blue
also
new
his
staff
was
made
up
of
clerks
coming
from
other
officers
without
mutual
ties
and
surprised
as
one
may
say
to
find
themselves
together
godeschal
who
had
served
his
apprenticeship
under
maitre
derville
was
not
the
sort
of
clerk
to
allow
the
precious
tradition
of
the
welcome
to
be
lost
this
welcome
is
a
breakfast
which
every
neophyte
must
give
to
the
ancients
of
the
office
into
which
he
enters
now
about
the
time
when
oscar
came
to
the
office
during
the
first
six
months
of
desroches
installation
on
a
winter
evening
when
the
work
had
been
got
through
more
quickly
than
usual
and
the
clerks
were
warming
themselves
before
the
fire
preparatory
to
departure
it
came
into
godeschal
s
head
to
construct
and
compose
a
register
of
the
utmost
antiquity
saved
from
the
fires
of
the
revolution
and
derived
through
the
procureur
of
the
the
immediate
predecessor
of
sauvaguest
the
attorney
from
whom
desroches
had
bought
his
practice
the
work
which
was
highly
approved
by
the
other
clerks
was
begun
by
a
search
through
all
the
dealers
in
old
paper
for
a
register
made
of
paper
with
the
mark
of
the
eighteenth
century
duly
bound
in
parchment
on
which
should
be
the
stamp
of
an
order
in
council
having
found
such
a
volume
it
was
left
about
in
the
dust
on
the
stove
on
the
ground
in
the
kitchen
and
even
in
what
the
clerks
called
the
chamber
of
deliberations
and
thus
it
obtained
a
mouldiness
to
delight
an
antiquary
cracks
of
aged
dilapidation
and
broken
corners
that
looked
as
though
the
rats
had
gnawed
them
also
the
gilt
edges
were
tarnished
with
surprising
perfection
as
soon
as
the
book
was
duly
prepared
the
entries
were
made
the
following
extracts
will
show
to
the
most
obtuse
mind
the
purpose
to
which
the
office
of
maitre
desroches
devoted
this
register
the
first
sixty
pages
of
which
were
filled
with
reports
of
fictitious
cases
on
the
first
page
appeared
as
follows
in
the
legal
spelling
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
so
be
it
this
day
the
feast
of
our
lady
patron
saint
of
paris
under
whose
protection
have
existed
since
the
year
the
clerks
of
this
practice
we
the
clerks
and
of
maistre
bordin
successor
to
the
late
guerbet
in
his
lifetime
procureur
at
the
chastelet
do
hereby
recognize
the
obligation
under
which
we
lie
to
renew
and
continue
the
register
and
the
archives
of
installation
of
the
clerks
of
this
noble
practice
a
glorious
member
of
the
kingdom
of
basoche
the
which
register
being
now
full
in
consequence
of
the
many
acts
and
deeds
of
our
predecessors
we
have
consigned
to
the
keeper
of
the
archives
of
the
palais
for
with
the
registers
of
other
ancient
practices
and
we
have
ourselves
gone
each
and
all
to
hear
mass
at
the
parish
church
of
to
solemnize
the
inauguration
of
this
our
new
register
in
witness
whereof
we
have
hereunto
signed
our
names
malin
grevin
athanase
feret
clerk
jacques
heret
clerk
regnault
de
angely
clerk
bedeau
youngest
clerk
and
in
the
year
of
our
lord
after
the
mass
aforesaid
was
heard
we
conveyed
ourselves
to
courtille
where
at
the
common
charge
we
ordered
a
fine
breakfast
which
did
not
end
till
seven
o
clock
the
next
morning
this
was
marvellously
well
engrossed
an
expert
would
have
said
that
it
was
written
in
the
eighteenth
century
reports
of
receptions
of
neophytes
followed
the
last
in
the
fatal
year
of
then
came
a
blank
of
fourteen
years
after
which
the
register
began
again
in
with
the
appointment
of
bordin
as
attorney
before
the
first
court
of
the
seine
and
here
follows
the
deed
which
proclaimed
the
reconstitution
of
the
kingdom
of
basoche
god
in
his
mercy
willed
that
in
spite
of
the
fearful
storms
which
have
cruelly
ravaged
the
land
of
france
now
become
a
great
empire
the
archives
of
the
very
celebrated
practice
of
maitre
bordin
should
be
preserved
and
we
the
undersigned
clerks
of
the
very
virtuous
and
very
worthy
maitre
bordin
do
not
hesitate
to
attribute
this
preservation
when
all
titles
privileges
and
charters
were
lost
to
the
protection
of
patron
saint
of
this
office
and
also
to
the
reverence
which
the
last
of
the
procureurs
of
noble
race
had
for
all
that
belonged
to
ancient
usages
and
customs
in
the
uncertainty
of
knowing
the
exact
part
of
and
maitre
bordin
in
this
miracle
we
have
resolved
each
of
us
to
go
to
du
mont
and
there
hear
mass
which
will
be
said
before
the
altar
of
that
who
sends
us
sheep
to
shear

also
to
offer
a
breakfast

that
the
writers
had
managed
to
put
upon

we
may
here
give
the
report
of
oscar
s
own
pretended
reception
this
day
monday
november
after
a
session
held
yesterday
at
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
arsenal
quarter
at
the
house
of
madame
clapart
mother
of
the
oscar
husson
we
the
undersigned
declare
that
the
repast
of
admission
surpassed
our
expectations
it
was
composed
of
radishes
pink
and
black
gherkins
anchovies
butter
and
olives
for
oeuvre
a
succulent
soup
of
rice
bearing
testimony
to
maternal
solicitude
for
we
recognized
therein
a
delicious
taste
of
poultry
indeed
by
acknowledgment
of
the
new
member
we
learned
that
the
gibbets
of
a
fine
stew
prepared
by
the
hands
of
madame
clapart
herself
had
been
judiciously
inserted
into
the
family
with
a
care
that
is
never
taken
except
in
such
households
item
the
said
gibbets
inclosed
in
a
sea
of
jelly
item
a
tongue
of
beef
with
tomatoes
which
rendered
us
all
automatoes
item
a
compote
of
pigeons
with
caused
us
to
think
the
angels
had
had
a
finger
in
it
item
a
timbale
of
macaroni
surrounded
by
chocolate
custards
item
a
dessert
composed
of
eleven
delicate
dishes
among
which
we
remarked
in
spite
of
the
tipsiness
caused
by
sixteen
bottles
of
the
choicest
wines
a
compote
of
peaches
of
august
and
mirobolant
delicacy
the
wines
of
roussillon
and
those
of
the
banks
of
the
rhone
completely
effaced
those
of
champagne
and
burgundy
a
bottle
of
maraschino
and
another
of
kirsch
did
in
spite
of
the
exquisite
coffee
plunge
us
into
so
marked
an
oenological
ecstasy
that
we
found
ourselves
at
a
late
hour
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
instead
of
our
domicile
where
we
thought
we
were
in
the
statutes
of
our
order
there
is
one
rule
which
is
rigidly
enforced
namely
to
allow
all
candidates
for
the
privilege
of
basoche
to
limit
the
magnificence
of
their
feast
of
welcome
to
the
length
of
their
purse
for
it
is
publicly
notorious
that
no
one
delivers
himself
up
to
themis
if
he
has
a
fortune
and
every
clerk
is
alas
sternly
curtailed
by
his
parents
consequently
we
hereby
record
with
the
highest
praise
the
liberal
conduct
of
madame
clapart
widow
by
her
first
marriage
of
monsieur
husson
father
of
the
candidate
who
is
worthy
of
the
hurrahs
which
we
gave
for
her
at
dessert
to
all
of
which
we
hereby
set
our
hands
signed
by
all
the
clerks
three
clerks
had
already
been
deceived
by
the
book
and
three
real
receptions
of
welcome
were
recorded
on
this
imposing
register
the
day
after
the
arrival
of
each
neophyte
the
little
the
and
laid
upon
the
s
desk
the
archives
and
the
clerks
enjoyed
the
sight
of
his
countenance
as
he
studied
its
facetious
pages
inter
pocula
each
candidate
had
learned
the
secret
of
the
farce
and
the
revelation
inspired
him
with
the
desire
to
hoax
his
successor

a
handsome
young
man
with
a
fine

day
the
new
clerk
found
the
register
lying
on
his
desk
he
took
it
up
but
after
reading
a
few
pages
he
began
to
laugh
said
nothing
to
the
assembled
clerks
and
laid
the
book
down
again

said

georges
recollecting
oscar
so

said
godeschal
addressing

scrape

in
consequence
of
that
what

georges
at
a
sign
from

he
bowled
us
over
ah
ca
so
you
want
to
jockey
my
cousin
do

replied
oscar
with
dignity
there
s
our
and
he
presented
the
famous
register
pointing
to
a
place
where
sentence
of
banishment
was
passed
on
a
refractory
who
was
stated
to
have
been
forced
for
acts
of
dishonesty
to
leave
the
office
in
georges
laughed
as
he
looked
through
the
archives
well
well
he
said
my
cousin
and
i
are
rich
and
we
ll
give
you

fete
such
as

never
had
before
something
to
stimulate
your
imaginations

register

bidden
to
the
rocher
de
cancale
at
two
o
clock
afterwards
i
ll
take
you
to
spend
the

with
madame
la
marquise

where

cards
and
you
ll
see
the
elite
of
the
women
of
fashion
therefore
gentleman
of
the
lower
courts
he
added
with
notarial
assumption
you
will
have
to
behave
yourselves
and
carry
your
wine
like
the
seigneurs
of
the
hurrah
cried
the
office
like
one
man
bravo
very
well
vivat
long
live
the
marests
what
s
all
this
about
asked
desroches
coming
out
from
his
private
office
ah
is
that
you
georges
i
know
what
you
are
after
you
want
to
demoralize
my
so
saying
he
withdrew
into
his
own
room
calling
oscar
after
him
here
he
said
opening
his
are
five
hundred
francs
go
to
the
palais
and
get
from
the
registrar
a
copy
of
the
decision
in
vandernesse
against
vandernesse
it
must
be
served
if
possible
i
have
promised
a
prod
of
twenty
francs
to
simon
wait
for
the
copy
if
it
is
not
ready
above
all
don
t
let
yourself
be
fooled
for
derville
is
capable
in
the
interest
of
his
clients
to
stick
a
spoke
in
our
wheel
count
felix
de
vandernesse
is
more
powerful
than
his
brother
our
client
the
ambassador
therefore
keep
your
eyes
open
and
if
there
s
the
slightest
hitch
come
back
to
me
at
oscar
departed
with
the
full
intention
of
distinguishing
himself
in
this
little
skirmish
the
first
affair
entrusted
to
him
since
his
installation
as
second
clerk
after
the
departure
of
georges
and
oscar
godeschal
sounded
the
new
clerk
to
discover
the
joke
which
as
he
thought
lay
behind
this
marquise
de
las
florentinas
y
cabirolos
but
frederic
with
the
coolness
and
gravity
of
a
king
s
attorney
continued
his
cousin
s
hoax
and
by
his
way
of
answering
and
his
manner
generally
he
succeeded
in
making
the
office
believe
that
the
marquise
might
really
be
the
widow
of
a
spanish
grandee
to
whom
his
cousin
georges
was
paying
his
addresses
born
in
mexico
and
the
daughter
of
creole
parents
this
young
and
wealthy
widow
was
noted
for
the
easy
manners
and
habits
of
the
women
of
those
climates
she
loves
to
laugh
she
loves
to
sing
she
loves
to
drink
like
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
quoting
the
song
of
beranger
georges
he
added
is
very
rich
he
has
inherited
from
his
father
who
was
a
widower
eighteen
thousand
francs
a
year
and
with
the
twelve
thousand
which
an
uncle
has
just
left
to
each
of
us
he
has
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
so
he
pays
his
debts
and
gives
up
the
law
he
hopes
to
be
marquis
de
las
florentinas
for
the
young
widow
is
marquise
in
her
own
right
and
has
the
privilege
of
giving
her
titles
to
her
though
the
clerks
were
still
a
good
deal
undecided
in
mind
as
to
the
marquise
the
double
perspective
of
a
breakfast
at
the
rocher
de
cancale
and
a
fashionable
festivity
put
them
into
a
state
of
joyous
expectation
they
reserved
all
points
as
to
the
spanish
lady
intending
to
judge
her
without
appeal
after
the
meeting
the
marquise
de
las
florentinas
y
cabirolos
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
mademoiselle
cabirolle
first
danseuse
at
the
gaiete
with
whom
uncle
cardot
was
in
the
habit
of
singing
mere
a
year
after
the
very
reparable
loss
of
madame
cardot
the
successful
merchant
encountered
florentine
as
she
was
leaving
coulon
s
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
that
choregraphic
flower
florentine
was
then
about
thirteen
years
of
age
he
followed
her
to
the
rue
pastourel
where
he
found
that
the
future
star
of
the
ballet
was
the
daughter
of
a
portress
two
weeks
later
the
mother
and
daughter
established
in
the
rue
de
crussol
were
enjoying
a
modest
competence
it
was
to
this
protector
of
the
arts
to
use
the
consecrated
phrase
that
the
theatre
owed
the
brilliant
danseuse
the
generous
maecenas
made
two
beings
almost
beside
themselves
with
joy
in
the
possession
of
mahogany
furniture
hangings
carpets
and
a
regular
kitchen
he
allowed
them
a
and
gave
them
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
for
their
living
pere
cardot
with
his
hair
in
seemed
like
an
angel
and
was
treated
with
the
attention
due
to
a
benefactor
to
him
this
was
the
age
of
gold
for
three
years
the
warbler
of
mere
godichon
had
the
wise
policy
to
keep
mademoiselle
cabirolle
and
her
mother
in
this
little
apartment
which
was
only
ten
steps
from
the
theatre
but
he
gave
the
girl
out
of
love
for
the
choregraphic
art
the
great
vestris
for
a
master
in
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
florentine
dance
her
first
pas
in
the
ballet
of
a
melodrama
entitled
the
ruins
of
florentine
was
then
about
sixteen
shortly
after
this
debut
pere
cardot
became
an
old
screw
in
the
eyes
of
his
protegee
but
as
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
a
danseuse
at
the
gaiete
had
a
certain
rank
to
maintain
he
raised
the
monthly
stipend
to
five
hundred
francs
for
which
although
he
did
not
again
become
an
angel
he
was
at
least
a
friend
for
life
a
second
father
this
was
his
silver
age
from
to
florentine
had
the
experience
of
every
danseuse
of
nineteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
her
friends
were
the
illustrious
mariette
and
tullia
leading
ladies
of
the
opera
florine
and
also
poor
coralie
torn
too
early
from
the
arts
and
love
and
camusot
as
old
cardot
had
by
this
time
acquired
five
additional
years
he
had
fallen
into
the
indulgence
of
a
which
is
the
way
with
old
men
towards
the
young
talents
they
have
trained
and
which
owe
their
success
to
them
besides
where
could
he
have
found
another
florentine
who
knew
all
his
habits
and
likings
and
with
whom
he
and
his
friends
could
sing
mere
godichon
so
the
little
old
man
remained
under
a
yoke
that
was
and
also
irresistibly
strong
this
was
the
brass
age
for
the
old
fellow
during
the
five
years
of
silver
and
gold
pere
cardot
had
laid
by
eighty
thousand
francs
the
old
gentleman
wise
from
experience
foresaw
that
by
the
time
he
was
seventy
florentine
would
be
of
age
probably
engaged
at
the
opera
and
consequently
wanting
all
the
luxury
of
a
theatrical
star
some
days
before
the
party
mentioned
by
georges
pere
cardot
had
spent
the
sum
of
thousand
francs
in
fitting
up
for
his
florentine
the
former
apartment
of
the
late
coralie
in
paris
there
are
suites
of
rooms
as
well
as
houses
and
streets
that
have
their
predestinations
enriched
with
a
magnificent
service
of
plate
the
prima
danseuse
of
the
gaiete
began
to
give
dinners
spent
three
hundred
francs
a
month
on
her
dress
never
went
out
except
in
a
hired
carriage
and
had
a
maid
for
herself
a
cook
and
a
little
footman
in
fact
an
engagement
at
the
opera
was
already
in
the
wind
the
cocon
d
or
did
homage
to
its
first
master
by
sending
its
most
splendid
products
for
the
gratification
of
mademoiselle
cabirolle
now
called
florentine
the
magnificence
which
suddenly
burst
upon
her
apartment
in
the
rue
de
vendome
would
have
satisfied
the
most
ambitious
supernumerary
after
being
the
master
of
the
ship
for
seven
years
cardot
now
found
himself
towed
along
by
a
force
of
unlimited
caprice
but
the
luckless
old
gentleman
was
fond
of
his
tyrant
florentine
was
to
close
his
eyes
he
meant
to
leave
her
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
iron
age
had
now
begun
georges
marest
with
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
handsome
face
courted
florentine
every
danseuse
makes
a
point
of
having
some
young
man
who
will
take
her
to
drive
and
arrange
the
gay
excursions
into
the
country
which
all
such
women
delight
in
however
disinterested
she
may
be
the
courtship
of
such
a
star
is
a
passion
which
costs
some
trifles
to
the
favored
mortal
there
are
dinners
at
restaurants
boxes
at
the
theatres
carriages
to
go
to
the
environs
and
return
choice
wines
consumed
in
profusion
for
an
opera
danseuse
eats
and
drinks
like
an
athlete
georges
amused
himself
like
other
young
men
who
pass
at
a
jump
from
paternal
discipline
to
a
rich
independence
and
the
death
of
his
uncle
nearly
doubling
his
means
had
still
further
enlarged
his
ideas
as
long
as
he
had
only
his
patrimony
of
eighteen
thousand
francs
a
year
his
intention
was
to
become
a
notary
but
as
his
cousin
remarked
to
the
clerks
of
desroches
a
man
must
be
stupid
who
begins
a
profession
with
the
fortune
most
men
hope
to
acquire
in
order
to
leave
it
wiser
then
georges
frederic
persisted
in
following
the
career
of
public
office
and
of
putting
himself
as
we
have
seen
in
training
for
it
a
young
man
as
handsome
and
attractive
as
georges
might
very
well
aspire
to
the
hand
of
a
rich
creole
and
the
clerks
in
desroches
office
all
of
them
the
sons
of
poor
parents
having
never
frequented
the
great
world
or
indeed
known
anything
about
it
put
themselves
into
their
best
clothes
on
the
following
day
impatient
enough
to
behold
and
be
presented
to
the
mexican
marquise
de
las
florentinas
y
cabirolos
what
luck
said
oscar
to
godeschal
as
they
were
getting
up
in
the
morning
that
i
had
just
ordered
a
new
coat
and
trousers
and
waistcoat
and
that
my
dear
mother
had
made
me
that
fine
outfit
i
have
six
frilled
shirts
of
fine
linen
in
the
dozen
she
made
for
me
we
shall
make
an
appearance
ha
ha
suppose
one
of
us
were
to
carry
off
the
creole
marchioness
from
that
georges
marest
fine
occupation
that
for
a
clerk
in
our
office
cried
godeschal
will
you
never
control
your
vanity
popinjay
ah
monsieur
said
madame
clapart
who
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
to
bring
her
son
some
cravats
and
overhead
the
last
words
of
the
would
to
god
that
my
oscar
might
always
follow
your
advice
it
is
what
i
tell
him
all
the
time
imitate
monsieur
godeschal
listen
to
what
he
tells
he
ll
go
all
right
madame
interposed
godeschal
but
he
mustn
t
commit
any
more
blunders
like
one
he
was
guilty
of
last
night
or
he
ll
lose
the
confidence
of
the
master
monsieur
desroches
won
t
stand
any
one
not
succeeding
in
what
he
tells
them
to
do
he
ordered
your
son
for
a
first
employment
in
his
new
clerkship
to
get
a
copy
of
a
judgment
which
ought
to
have
been
served
last
evening
and
oscar
instead
of
doing
so
allowed
himself
to
be
fooled
the
master
was
furious
it
s
a
chance
if
i
have
been
able
to
repair
the
mischief
by
going
this
morning
at
six
o
clock
to
see
the
at
the
palais
who
has
promised
me
to
have
a
copy
ready
by
seven
o
clock
ah
godeschal
cried
oscar
going
up
to
him
and
pressing
his
hand
you
are
indeed
a
true
ah
monsieur
said
madame
clapart
a
mother
is
happy
indeed
in
knowing
that
her
son
has
a
friend
like
you
you
may
rely
upon
a
gratitude
which
can
end
only
with
my
life
oscar
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
now
distrust
that
georges
marest
i
wish
you
had
never
met
him
again
for
he
was
the
cause
of
your
first
great
misfortune
in
was
he
how
so
asked
godeschal
the
too
devoted
mother
explained
succinctly
the
adventure
of
her
poor
oscar
in
pierrotin
s
coucou
i
am
certain
said
godeschal
that
that
blagueur
is
preparing
some
trick
against
us
for
this
evening
as
for
me
i
can
t
go
to
the
marquise
de
las
florentinas
party
for
my
sister
wants
me
to
draw
up
the
terms
of
her
new
engagement
i
shall
have
to
leave
after
the
dessert
but
oscar
be
on
your
guard
they
will
ask
you
to
play
and
of
course
the
desroches
office
mustn
t
draw
back
but
be
careful
you
shall
play
for
both
of
us
here
s
a
hundred
francs
said
the
good
fellow
knowing
that
oscar
s
purse
was
dry
from
the
demands
of
his
tailor
and
bootmaker
be
prudent
remember
not
to
play
beyond
that
sum
and
don
t
let
yourself
get
tipsy
either
with
play
or
libations
saperlotte
a
second
clerk
is
already
a
man
of
weight
and
shouldn
t
gamble
on
notes
or
go
beyond
a
certain
limit
in
anything
his
business
is
to
get
himself
admitted
to
the
bar
therefore
don
t
drink
too
much
don
t
play
too
long
and
maintain
a
proper
dignity
that
s
your
rule
of
conduct
above
all
get
home
by
midnight
for
remember
you
must
be
at
the
palais
morning
by
seven
to
get
that
judgment
a
man
is
not
forbidden
to
amuse
himself
but
business
first
my
do
you
hear
that
oscar
said
madame
clapart
monsieur
godeschal
is
indulgent
see
how
well
he
knows
how
to
combine
the
pleasures
of
youth
and
the
duties
of
his
madame
clapart
on
the
arrival
of
the
tailor
and
the
bootmaker
with
oscar
s
new
clothes
remained
alone
with
godeschal
in
order
to
return
him
the
hundred
francs
he
had
just
given
her
son
ah
monsieur
she
said
the
blessings
of
a
mother
will
follow
you
wherever
you
go
and
in
all
your
poor
woman
she
now
had
the
supreme
delight
of
seeing
her
son
and
she
gave
him
a
gold
watch
the
price
of
which
she
had
saved
by
economy
as
the
reward
of
his
good
conduct
you
draw
for
the
conscription
next
week
she
said
and
to
prepare
in
case
you
get
a
bad
number
i
have
been
to
see
your
uncle
cardot
he
is
very
much
pleased
with
you
and
so
delighted
to
know
you
are
a
second
clerk
at
twenty
and
to
hear
of
your
successful
examination
at
the
that
he
promised
me
the
money
for
a
substitute
are
not
you
glad
to
think
that
your
own
good
conduct
has
brought
such
reward
though
you
have
some
privations
to
bear
remember
the
happiness
of
being
able
five
years
from
now
to
buy
a
practice
and
think
too
my
dear
little
kitten
how
happy
you
make
your
oscar
s
face
somewhat
thinned
by
study
had
acquired
through
habits
of
business
a
serious
expression
he
had
reached
his
full
growth
his
beard
was
thriving
adolescence
had
given
place
to
virility
the
mother
could
not
refrain
from
admiring
her
son
and
kissing
him
as
she
said
amuse
yourself
my
dear
boy
but
remember
the
advice
of
our
good
monsieur
godeschal
ah
by
the
bye
i
was
nearly
forgetting
here
s
a
present
our
friend
moreau
sends
you
see
what
a
pretty
and
i
want
it
too
for
the
master
gave
me
five
hundred
francs
to
get
that
cursed
judgment
of
vandernesse
versus
vandernesse
and
i
don
t
want
to
leave
that
sum
of
money
in
my
but
surely
you
are
not
going
to
carry
it
with
you
exclaimed
his
mother
in
alarm
suppose
you
should
lose
a
sum
like
that
hadn
t
you
better
give
it
to
monsieur
godeschal
for
safe
keeping
godeschal
cried
oscar
who
thought
his
mother
s
suggestion
excellent
but
godeschal
who
like
all
clerks
has
his
time
to
himself
on
sundays
from
ten
to
two
o
clock
had
already
departed
when
his
mother
left
him
oscar
went
to
lounge
upon
the
boulevards
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
georges
marest
s
breakfast
why
not
display
those
beautiful
clothes
which
he
wore
with
a
pride
and
joy
which
all
young
fellows
who
have
been
pinched
for
means
in
their
youth
will
remember
a
pretty
waistcoat
with
a
blue
ground
and
a
pattern
a
pair
of
black
cashmere
trousers
pleated
a
black
coat
very
well
fitting
and
a
cane
with
a
gilt
top
the
cost
of
which
he
had
saved
himself
caused
a
natural
joy
to
the
poor
lad
who
thought
of
his
manner
of
dress
on
the
day
of
that
journey
to
presles
as
the
effect
that
georges
had
then
produced
upon
him
came
back
to
his
mind
oscar
had
before
him
the
perspective
of
a
day
of
happiness
he
was
to
see
the
gay
world
at
last
let
us
admit
that
a
clerk
deprived
of
enjoyments
though
longing
for
dissipation
was
likely
to
let
his
unchained
senses
drive
the
wise
counsels
of
his
mother
and
godeschal
completely
out
of
his
mind
to
the
shame
of
youth
let
it
be
added
that
good
advice
is
never
lacking
to
it
in
the
matter
of
georges
oscar
himself
had
a
feeling
of
aversion
for
him
he
felt
humiliated
before
a
witness
of
that
scene
in
the
salon
at
presles
when
moreau
had
flung
him
at
the
count
s
feet
the
moral
senses
have
their
laws
which
are
implacable
and
we
are
always
punished
for
disregarding
them
there
is
one
in
particular
which
the
animals
themselves
obey
without
discussion
and
invariably
it
is
that
which
tells
us
to
avoid
those
who
have
once
injured
us
with
or
without
intention
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
the
creature
from
whom
we
receive
either
damage
or
annoyance
will
always
be
displeasing
to
us
whatever
may
be
his
rank
or
the
degree
of
affection
in
which
he
stands
to
us
it
is
best
to
break
away
from
him
for
our
evil
genius
has
sent
him
to
us
though
the
christian
sentiment
is
opposed
to
it
obedience
to
this
terrible
law
is
essentially
social
and
conservative
the
daughter
of
james
who
seated
herself
upon
her
father
s
throne
must
have
caused
him
many
a
wound
before
that
usurpation
judas
had
certainly
given
some
murderous
blow
to
jesus
before
he
betrayed
him
we
have
within
us
an
inward
power
of
sight
an
eye
of
the
soul
which
foresees
catastrophes
and
the
repugnance
that
comes
over
us
against
the
fateful
being
is
the
result
of
that
foresight
though
religion
orders
us
to
conquer
it
distrust
remains
and
its
voice
is
forever
heard
would
oscar
at
twenty
years
of
age
have
the
wisdom
to
listen
to
it
alas
when
at
two
o
clock
oscar
entered
the
salon
of
the
rocher
de
cancale
where
were
three
invited
persons
besides
the
clerks
to
wit
an
old
captain
of
dragoons
named
giroudeau
finot
a
journalist
who
might
procure
an
engagement
for
florentine
at
the
opera
and
du
bruel
an
author
the
friend
of
tullia
one
of
mariette
s
rivals
the
second
clerk
felt
his
secret
hostility
vanish
at
the
first
handshaking
the
first
dashes
of
conversation
as
they
sat
around
a
table
luxuriously
served
georges
moreover
made
himself
charming
to
oscar
you
ve
taken
to
private
diplomacy
he
said
for
what
difference
is
there
between
a
lawyer
and
an
ambassador
only
that
between
a
nation
and
an
individual
ambassadors
are
the
attorneys
of
peoples
if
i
can
ever
be
useful
to
you
let
me
well
said
oscar
i
ll
admit
to
you
now
that
you
once
did
me
a
very
great
pooh
said
georges
after
listening
to
the
explanation
for
which
he
asked
it
was
monsieur
de
serizy
who
behaved
badly
his
wife
i
wouldn
t
have
her
at
any
price
neither
would
i
like
to
be
in
the
count
s
red
skin
minister
of
state
and
peer
of
france
as
he
is
he
has
a
small
mind
and
i
don
t
care
a
fig
for
him
oscar
listened
with
true
pleasure
to
these
slurs
on
the
count
for
they
diminished
in
a
way
the
importance
of
his
fault
and
he
echoed
the
spiteful
language
of
the
who
amused
himself
by
predicting
the
blows
to
the
nobility
of
which
the
bourgeoisie
were
already
dreaming
blows
which
were
destined
to
become
a
reality
in
at
three
the
solid
eating
of
the
feast
began
the
dessert
did
not
appear
till
eight
o
clock
each
course
having
taken
two
hours
to
serve
none
but
clerks
can
eat
like
that
the
stomachs
of
eighteen
and
twenty
are
inexplicable
to
the
medical
art
the
wines
were
worthy
of
borrel
who
in
those
days
had
superseded
the
illustrious
balaine
the
creator
of
the
first
restaurant
for
delicate
and
perfectly
prepared
food
in
paris
that
is
to
say
the
whole
world
the
report
of
this
belshazzar
s
feast
for
the
register
was
duly
drawn
up
beginning
inter
pocula
aurea
restauranti
qui
vulgo
dicitur
rupes
every
one
can
imagine
the
fine
page
now
added
to
the
golden
book
of
jurisprudential
festivals
godeschal
disappeared
after
signing
the
report
leaving
the
eleven
guests
stimulated
by
the
old
captain
of
the
imperial
guard
to
the
wines
toasts
and
liqueurs
of
a
dessert
composed
of
choice
and
early
fruits
in
pyramids
that
rivalled
the
obelisk
of
thebes
by
ten
the
little
was
in
such
a
state
that
georges
packed
him
into
a
coach
paid
his
fare
and
gave
the
address
of
his
mother
to
the
driver
the
remaining
ten
all
as
drunk
as
pitt
and
dundas
talked
of
going
on
foot
along
the
boulevards
considering
the
fine
evening
to
the
house
of
the
marquise
de
las
florentinas
y
cabirolos
where
about
midnight
they
might
expect
to
find
the
most
brilliant
society
of
paris
they
felt
the
need
of
breathing
the
pure
air
into
their
lungs
but
with
the
exception
of
georges
giroudeau
du
bruel
and
finot
all
four
accustomed
to
parisian
orgies
not
one
of
the
party
could
walk
consequently
georges
sent
to
a
for
three
open
carriages
in
which
he
drove
his
company
for
an
hour
round
the
exterior
boulevards
from
monmartre
to
the
barriere
du
trone
they
returned
by
bercy
the
quays
and
the
boulevards
to
the
rue
de
vendome
the
clerks
were
fluttering
still
in
the
skies
of
fancy
to
which
youth
is
lifted
by
intoxication
when
their
amphitryon
introduced
them
into
florentine
s
salon
there
sparkled
a
bevy
of
stage
princesses
who
having
been
informed
no
doubt
of
frederic
s
joke
were
amusing
themselves
by
imitating
the
women
of
good
society
they
were
then
engaged
in
eating
ices
the
flamed
in
the
candelabra
tullia
s
footmen
and
those
of
madame
du
and
florine
all
in
full
livery
where
serving
the
dainties
on
silver
salvers
the
hangings
a
marvel
of
lyonnaise
workmanship
fastened
by
gold
cords
dazzled
all
eyes
the
flowers
of
the
carpet
were
like
a
garden
the
richest
bibelots
and
curiosities
danced
before
the
eyes
of
the
at
first
and
in
the
state
to
which
georges
had
brought
them
the
clerks
and
more
particularly
oscar
believed
in
the
marquise

las
florentinas

on

in
the

the
salon
the
women
were
playing
at
kept
by
nathan
the
celebrated
author
after
wandering
tipsy
and
half
asleep
through
the
dark
exterior
boulevards
the
clerks
now
felt
that
they
had
wakened
in
the
palace
of
armida
oscar
presented
to
the
marquise
by
georges
was
quite
stupefied
and
did
not
recognize
the
danseuse
he
had
seen
at
the
gaiete
in
this
lady
aristocratically
decolletee
and
swathed
in
laces
till
she
looked
like
the
vignette
of
a
keepsake
who
received
him
with
manners
and
graces
the
like
of
which
was
neither
in
the
memory
nor
the
imagination
of
a
young
clerk
rigidly
brought
up
after
admiring
the
splendors
of
the
apartment
and
the
beautiful
women
there
displayed
who
had
all
outdone
each
other
in
their
dress
for
this
occasion
oscar
was
taken
by
the
hand
and
led
by
florentine
to
a
table
let
me
present
you
she
said
to
the
beautiful
marquise
d
anglade
one
of
my
nearest
and
she
took
oscar
to
the
pretty
fanny
beaupre
who
had
just
made
herself
a
reputation
at
the
in
a
melodrama
entitled
la

the
actress
smiling
as
she
looked
at
oscar

and
the
marquise
took
out
from
her
purse
the
rings
of
which
were
adorned
with
diamonds
five
gold
pieces
oscar
pulled
out
his
hundred
in
silver
pieces
much
ashamed
at
having
to
mingle
such
ignoble
coins
with
gold
in
ten
throws
the
actress
lost
the
two
hundred
francs
oh
how

cried
i

fanny
beaupre
rose
to
take
her
place
as

and
oscar
finding
himself
observed
by
the
whole
table
dared
not
retire
on
the
ground
that
he
had
no
money
speech
failed
him
and
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth

five
hundred
francs
said
the
actress
to
the
danseuse
florentine
brought
the
money
which
she
obtained
from
georges
who
had
just
passed
eight
times
at
ecarte

hundred
francs
said
the
actress
to
oscar
bankers
always

t
let
them
fool
us
will
we
she
whispered
in
his
ear
persons
of
nerve
imagination
and
dash
will
understand
how
it
was
that
poor
oscar
opened
his
and
took
out
the
note
of
five
hundred
francs
which
desroches
had
given
him
he
looked
at
nathan
the
distinguished
author
who
now
began
with
florine
to
play
a
heavy
game
against
the
bank
come
my
little
man
take
em
up
cried
fanny
beaupre
signing
to
oscar
to
rake
in
the
two
hundred
francs
which
nathan
and
florine
had
punted
the
actress
did
not
spare
taunts
or
jests
on
those
who
lost
she
enlivened
the
game
with
jokes
which
oscar
thought
singular
but
reflection
was
stifled
by
joy
for
the
first
two
throws
produced
a
gain
of
two
thousand
francs
oscar
then
thought
of
feigning
illness
and
making
his
escape
leaving
his
partner
behind
him
but
honor
kept
him
there
three
more
turns
and
the
gains
were
lost
oscar
felt
a
cold
sweat
running
down
his
back
and
he
was
sobered
completely
the
next
two
throws
carried
off
the
thousand
francs
of
their
mutual
stake
oscar
was
consumed
with
thirst
and
drank
three
glasses
of
iced
punch
one
after
the
other
the
actress
now
led
him
into
the
where
the
rest
of
the
company
were
playing
talking
frivolities
with
an
easy
air
but
by
this
time
the
sense
of
his
overcame
him
the
figure
of
desroches
appeared
to
him
like
a
vision
he
turned
aside
to
a
dark
corner
and
sat
down
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
and
wept
florentine
noticed
the
attitude
of
true
grief
which
because
it
is
sincere
is
certain
to
strike
the
eye
of
one
who
acts
she
ran
to
him
took
the
handkerchief
from
his
hand
and
saw
his
tears
then
she
led
him
into
a
boudoir
alone
what
is
it
my
child
she
said
at
the
tone
and
accent
of
that
voice
oscar
recognized
a
motherly
kindness
which
is
often
found
in
women
of
her
kind
and
he
answered
openly
i
have
lost
five
hundred
francs
which
my
employer
gave
me
to
obtain
a
document
morning
there
s
nothing
for
me
but
to
fling
myself
into
the
river
i
am
how
silly
you
are
she
said
stay
where
you
are
i
ll
get
you
a
thousand
francs
and
you
can
win
back
what
you
ve
lost
but
don
t
risk
more
than
five
hundred
so
that
you
may
be
sure
of
your
master
s
money
georges
plays
a
fine
game
at
ecarte
bet
on
oscar
frightened
by
his
position
accepted
the
offer
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
ah
he
thought
it
is
only
women
of
rank
who
are
capable
of
such
kindness
beautiful
noble
rich
how
lucky
georges
is
he
received
the
thousand
francs
from
florentine
and
returned
to
bet
on
his
hoaxer
georges
had
just
passed
for
the
fourth
time
when
oscar
sat
down
beside
him
the
other
players
saw
with
satisfaction
the
arrival
of
a
new
better
for
all
with
the
instinct
of
gamblers
took
the
side
of
giroudeau
the
old
officer
of
the
empire
messieurs
said
georges
you
ll
be
punished
for
deserting
me
i
feel
in
the
vein
come
oscar
we
ll
make
an
end
of
them
georges
and
his
partner
lost
five
games
running
after
losing
the
thousand
francs
oscar
was
seized
with
the
fury
of
play
and
insisted
on
taking
the
cards
himself
by
the
result
of
a
chance
not
at
all
uncommon
with
those
who
play
for
the
first
time
he
won
but
georges
bewildered
him
with
advice
told
him
when
to
throw
the
cards
and
even
snatched
them
from
his
hand
so
that
this
conflict
of
wills
and
intuitions
injured
his
vein
by
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
after
various
changes
of
fortune
and
still
drinking
punch
oscar
came
down
to
his
last
hundred
francs
he
rose
with
a
heavy
head
completely
stupefied
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
fell
upon
a
sofa
in
the
boudoir
his
eyes
closing
in
a
leaden
sleep
mariette

take
him
and
his
orgies
exclaimed
florentine

mariette
she
continued
cardot
always
orders
them
from
chevet
s
bring
your
duc
de
maufrigneuse
and
we
ll
make
them
dance
like
hearing
the
names
of
cardot
and
camusot
oscar
made
an
effort
to
throw
off
his
sleep
but
he
could
only
mutter
a
few
words
which
were
not
understood
and
then
he
fell
back
upon
the
silken
cushions
you
ll
have
to
keep
him
here
all
night
said
fanny
beaupre
laughing
to
florentine
oh
poor
boy
he
is
drunk
with
punch
and
despair
both
it
is
the
second
clerk
in
your
brother
s
office
she
said
to
mariette
he
has
lost
the
money
his
master
gave
him
for
some
legal
affair
he
wanted
to
drown
himself
so
i
lent
him
a
thousand
francs
but
those
brigands
finot
and
giroudeau
won
them
from
him
poor
innocent
but
we
ought
to
wake
him
said
mariette
my
brother
won
t
make
light
of
it
nor
his
master
oh
wake
him
if
you
can
and
carry
him
off
with
you
said
florentine
returning
to
the
salon
to
receive
the
adieux
of
some
departing
guests
presently
those
who
remained
began
what
was
called
character
dancing
and
by
the
time
it
was
broad
daylight
florentine
tired
out
went
to
bed
oblivious
to
oscar
who
was
still
in
the
boudoir
sound
asleep
chapter
x
another
catastrophe
about
eleven
the
next
morning
a
terrible
sound
awoke
the
unfortunate
clerk
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
uncle
cardot
he
thought
it
wise
to
feign
sleep
and
so
turned
his
face
into
the
yellow
velvet
cushions
on
which
he
had
passed
the
night
really
my
little
florentine
said
the
old
gentleman
this
is
neither
right
nor
sensible
you
danced
last
evening
in
les
ruines
and
you
have
spent
the
night
in
an
orgy
that
s
deliberately
going
to
work
to
lose
your
freshness
besides
which
it
was
ungrateful
to
inaugurate
this
beautiful
apartment
without
even
letting
me
know
who
knows
what
has
been
going
on
here
old
monster
cried
florentine
haven
t
you
a
key
that
lets
you
in
at
all
hours
my
ball
lasted
till
five
in
the
morning
and
you
have
the
cruelty
to
come
and
wake
me
up
at
eleven
eleven
titine
observed
cardot
humbly
i
came
out
early
to
order
a
dinner
fit
for
an
archbishop
at
chevet
s
just
see
how
the
carpets
are
stained
what
sort
of
people
did
you
have
here
you
needn
t
complain
for
fanny
beaupre
told
me
you
were
coming
to
dinner
with
camusot
and
to
please
you
i
ve
invited
tullia
du
bruel
mariette
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
florine
and
nathan
so
you
ll
have
the
four
loveliest
creatures
ever
seen
behind
the
we
ll
dance
you
a
pas
de
it
is
enough
to
kill
you
to
lead
such
a
life
cried
old
cardot
and
look
at
the
broken
glasses
what
pillage
the
antechamber
actually
makes
me
shudder
at
this
instant
the
wrathful
old
gentleman
stopped
short
as
if
magnetized
like
a
bird
which
a
snake
is
charming
he
saw
the
outline
of
a
form
in
a
black
coat
through
the
door
of
the
boudoir
ah
mademoiselle
cabirolle
he
said
at
last
well
what
she
asked
the
eyes
of
the
danseuse
followed
those
of
the
little
old
man
and
when
she
recognized
the
presence
of
the
clerk
she
went
off
into
such
fits
of
laughter
that
not
only
was
the
old
gentleman
nonplussed
but
oscar
was
compelled
to
appear
for
florentine
took
him
by
the
arm
still
pealing
with
laughter
at
the
faces
of
the
uncle
and
nephew
you
here
nephew
nephew
so
he
s
your
nephew
cried
florentine
with
another
burst
of
laughter
you
never
told
me
about
him
why
didn
t
mariette
carry
you
off
she
said
to
oscar
who
stood
there
petrified
what
can
he
do
now
poor
boy
whatever
he
pleases
said
cardot
sharply
marching
to
the
door
as
if
to
go
away
one
moment
papa
cardot
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
get
your
nephew
out
of
a
scrape
into
which
i
led
him
for
he
played
the
money
of
his
master
and
lost
it
and
i
lend
him
a
thousand
francs
to
win
it
back
and
he
lost
that
miserable
boy
you
lost
fifteen
hundred
francs
at
play
at
your
age
oh
uncle
uncle
cried
poor
oscar
plunged
by
these
words
into
all
the
horrors
of
his
position
and
falling
on
his
knees
before
his
uncle
with
clasped
hands
it
is
twelve
o
clock
i
am
lost
dishonored
monsieur
desroches
will
have
no
pity
he
gave
me
the
money
for
an
important
affair
in
which
his
pride
was
concerned
i
was
to
get
a
paper
at
the
palais
in
the
case
of
vandernesse
versus
vandernesse
what
will
become
of
me
oh
save
me
for
the
sake
of
my
father
and
aunt
come
with
me
to
monsieur
desroches
and
explain
it
to
him
make
some
excuse
anything
these
sentences
were
jerked
out
through
sobs
and
tears
that
might
have
moved
the
sphinx
of
luxor
old
skinflint
said
the
danseuse
who
was
crying
will
you
let
your
own
nephew
be
dishonored
the
son
of
the
man
to
whom
you
owe
your
fortune
for
his
name
is
oscar
husson
save
him
or
titine
will
deny
you
forever
but
how
did
he
come
here
asked
cardot
don
t
you
see
that
the
reason
he
forgot
to
go
for
those
papers
was
because
he
was
drunk
and
overslept
himself
georges
and
his
cousin
frederic
took
all
the
clerks
in
his
office
to
a
feast
at
the
rocher
de
pere
cardot
looked
at
florentine
and
hesitated
come
come
she
said
you
old
monkey
shouldn
t
i
have
hid
him
better
if
there
had
been
anything
else
in
it
there
take
your
five
hundred
francs
you
scamp
said
cardot
to
his
nephew
and
remember
that
s
the
last
penny
you
ll
ever
get
from
me
go
and
make
it
up
with
your
master
if
you
can
i
ll
return
the
thousand
francs
which
you
borrowed
of
mademoiselle
but
i
ll
never
hear
another
word
about
oscar
disappeared
not
wishing
to
hear
more
once
in
the
street
however
he
knew
not
where
to
go
chance
which
destroys
men
and
chance
which
saves
them
were
both
making
equal
efforts
for
and
against
oscar
during
that
fateful
morning
but
he
was
doomed
to
fall
before
a
master
who
forgave
no
failure
in
any
affair
he
had
once
undertaken
when
mariette
reached
home
that
night
she
felt
alarmed
at
what
might
happen
to
the
youth
in
whom
her
brother
took
interest
and
she
wrote
a
hasty
note
to
godeschal
telling
him
what
had
happened
to
oscar
and
inclosing
a
bank
bill
for
five
hundred
francs
to
repair
his
loss
the
creature
went
to
sleep
after
charging
her
maid
to
carry
the
little
note
to
desroches
office
before
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
godeschal
on
his
side
getting
up
at
six
and
finding
that
oscar
had
not
returned
guessed
what
had
happened
he
took
the
five
hundred
francs
from
his
own
little
hoard
and
rushed
to
the
palais
where
he
obtained
a
copy
of
the
judgment
and
returned
in
time
to
lay
it
before
desroches
by
eight
o
clock
meantime
desroches
who
always
rose
at
four
was
in
his
office
by
seven
mariette
s
maid
not
finding
the
brother
of
her
mistress
in
his
bedroom
came
down
to
the
office
and
there
met
desroches
to
whom
she
very
naturally
offered
the
note
is
it
about
business
he
said
i
am
monsieur
you
can
see
monsieur
replied
the
maid
desroches
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
finding
the
note
he
went
into
his
private
office
furiously
angry
with
his
second
clerk
about
seven
he
heard
godeschal
dictating
to
the
second
a
copy
of
the
document
in
question
and
a
few
moments
later
the
good
fellow
entered
his
master
s
office
with
an
air
of
triumph
in
his
heart
did
oscar
husson
fetch
the
paper
this
morning
from
simon
inquired
desroches
yes
who
gave
him
the
money
why
you
did
saturday
replied
godeschal
then
it
rains
notes
cried
desroches
look
here
godeschal
you
are
a
fine
fellow
but
that
little
husson
does
not
deserve
such
generosity
i
hate
idiots
but
i
hate
still
more
the
men
who
will
go
wrong
in
spite
of
the
fatherly
care
which
watches
over
he
gave
godeschal
mariette
s
letter
and
the
note
which
she
had
sent
you
must
excuse
my
having
opened
it
he
said
but
your
sister
s
maid
told
me
it
was
on
business
dismiss
poor
unhappy
boy
what
grief
he
has
caused
me
said
godeschal
that
tall
ne
of
a
georges
marest
is
his
evil
genius
he
ought
to
flee
him
like
the
plague
if
not
he
ll
bring
him
to
some
third
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
desroches
godeschal
then
related
briefly
the
affair
of
the
journey
to
presles
ah
yes
said
the
lawyer
i
remember
joseph
bridau
told
me
that
story
about
the
time
it
happened
it
is
to
that
meeting
that
we
owe
the
favor
monsieur
de
serizy
has
since
shown
in
the
matter
of
joseph
s
brother
philippe
at
this
moment
moreau
to
whom
the
case
of
the
vandernesse
estate
was
of
much
importance
entered
the
office
the
marquis
wished
to
sell
the
land
in
parcels
and
the
count
was
opposed
to
such
a
sale
the
received
therefore
the
first
fire
of
desroches
wrath
against
his
clerk
and
all
the
threatening
prophecies
which
he
fulminated
against
him
the
result
was
that
this
most
sincere
friend
and
protector
of
the
unhappy
youth
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
vanity
was
incorrigible
make
him
a
barrister
said
desroches
he
has
only
his
last
examination
to
pass
in
that
line
his
defects
might
prove
virtues
for
and
vanity
give
tongues
to
half
the
at
this
time
clapart
who
was
ill
was
being
nursed
by
his
wife
a
painful
task
a
duty
without
reward
the
sick
man
tormented
the
poor
creature
who
was
now
doomed
to
learn
what
venomous
and
spiteful
teasing
a
man
whom
poverty
had
rendered
craftily
savage
could
be
capable
of
in
the
weary
of
each
endless
day
delighted
to
turn
a
sharpened
arrow
in
the
sensitive
heart
of
the
mother
he
had
in
a
measure
studied
the
fears
that
oscar
s
behavior
and
defects
inspired
in
the
poor
woman
when
a
mother
receives
from
her
child
a
shock
like
that
of
the
affair
at
presles
she
continues
in
a
state
of
constant
fear
and
by
the
manner
in
which
his
wife
boasted
of
oscar
every
time
he
obtained
the
slightest
success
clapart
knew
the
extent
of
her
secret
uneasiness
and
he
took
pains
to
rouse
it
on
every
occasion
well
madame
clapart
would
say
oscar
is
doing
better
than
i
even
hoped
that
journey
to
presles
was
only
a
heedlessness
of
youth
where
can
you
find
young
lads
who
do
not
commit
just
such
faults
poor
child
he
bears
his
privations
heroically
if
his
father
had
lived
he
would
never
have
had
any
god
grant
he
may
know
how
to
control
his
passions
etc
while
all
these
catastrophes
were
happening
in
the
rue
de
vendome
and
the
rue
de
bethisy
clapart
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
wrapped
in
an
old
watched
his
wife
who
was
engaged
over
the
fire
in
their
bedroom
in
simultaneously
making
the
family
broth
clapart
s
tisane
and
her
own
breakfast
mon
dieu
i
wish
i
knew
how
the
affair
of
yesterday
ended
oscar
was
to
breakfast
at
the
rocher
de
cancale
and
spend
the
evening
with
a
marquise
don
t
trouble
yourself
sooner
or
later
you
ll
find
out
about
your
swan
said
her
husband
do
you
really
believe
in
that
marquise
pooh
a
young
man
who
has
senses
and
a
taste
for
extravagance
like
oscar
can
find
such
ladies
as
that
on
every
bush
if
he
pays
for
them
some
fine
morning
you
ll
find
yourself
with
a
load
of
debt
on
your
you
are
always
trying
to
put
me
in
despair
cried
madame
clapart
you
complained
that
my
son
lived
on
your
salary
and
never
has
he
cost
you
a
penny
for
two
years
you
haven
t
had
the
slightest
cause
of
complaint
against
him
here
he
is
second
clerk
his
uncle
and
monsieur
moreau
pay
all
expenses
and
he
earns
himself
a
salary
of
eight
hundred
francs
if
we
have
bread
to
eat
in
our
old
age
we
may
owe
it
all
to
that
dear
boy
you
are
really
too
unjust
you
call
my
foresight
unjust
do
you
replied
the
invalid
crossly
just
then
the
bell
rang
loudly
madame
clapart
ran
to
open
the
door
and
remained
in
the
outer
room
with
moreau
who
had
come
to
soften
the
blow
which
oscar
s
new
folly
would
deal
to
the
heart
of
his
poor
mother
what
he
gambled
with
the
money
of
the
office
she
cried
bursting
into
tears
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
hey
said
clapart
appearing
like
a
spectre
at
the
door
of
the
salon
whither
his
curiosity
had
brought
him
oh
what
shall
we
do
with
him
said
madame
clapart
whose
grief
made
her
impervious
to
clapart
s
taunt
if
he
bore
my
name
replied
moreau
i
should
wait
composedly
till
he
draws
for
the
conscription
and
if
he
gets
a
fatal
number
i
should
not
provide
him
with
a
substitute
this
is
the
second
time
your
son
has
committed
a
folly
out
of
sheer
vanity
well
vanity
may
inspire
fine
deeds
in
war
and
may
advance
him
in
the
career
of
a
soldier
besides
six
years
of
military
service
will
put
some
lead
into
his
head
and
as
he
has
only
his
last
legal
examination
to
pass
it
won
t
be
much
for
him
if
he
doesn
t
become
a
lawyer
till
he
is
that
is
if
he
wants
to
continue
in
the
law
after
paying
as
they
say
his
tax
of
blood
by
that
time
at
any
rate
he
will
have
been
severely
punished
he
will
have
learned
experience
and
contracted
habits
of
subordination
before
making
his
probation
at
the
bar
he
will
have
gone
through
his
probations
in
if
that
is
your
decision
for
a
son
said
madame
clapart
i
see
that
the
heart
of
a
father
is
not
like
that
of
a
mother
my
poor
oscar
a
common
soldier
would
you
rather
he
flung
himself
headforemost
into
the
seine
after
committing
a
dishonorable
action
he
can
not
now
become
a
solicitor
do
you
think
him
steady
and
wise
enough
to
be
a
barrister
no
while
his
reason
is
maturing
what
will
he
become
a
dissipated
fellow
the
discipline
of
the
army
will
at
least
preserve
him
from
could
he
not
go
into
some
other
office
his
uncle
cardot
has
promised
to
pay
for
his
substitute
oscar
is
to
dedicate
his
graduating
thesis
to
at
this
moment
were
heard
and
a
containing
oscar
and
all
his
worldly
belongings
stopped
before
the
door
the
luckless
young
man
came
up
at
once
ah
here
you
are
monsieur
cried
clapart
oscar
kissed
his
mother
and
held
out
to
moreau
a
hand
which
the
latter
refused
to
take
to
this
rebuff
oscar
replied
by
a
reproachful
look
the
boldness
of
which
he
had
never
shown
before
then
he
turned
on
clapart
listen
to
me
monsieur
said
the
youth
transformed
into
a
man
you
worry
my
poor
mother
devilishly
and
that
s
your
right
for
she
is
unfortunately
your
wife
but
as
for
me
it
is
another
thing
i
shall
be
of
age
in
a
few
months
and
you
have
no
rights
over
me
even
as
a
minor
i
have
never
asked
anything
of
you
thanks
to
monsieur
moreau
i
have
never
cost
you
one
penny
and
i
owe
you
no
gratitude
therefore
i
say
let
me
alone
clapart
hearing
this
apostrophe
slunk
back
to
his
sofa
in
the
chimney
corner
the
reasoning
and
the
inward
fury
of
the
young
man
who
had
just
received
a
lecture
from
his
friend
godeschal
silenced
the
imbecile
mind
of
the
sick
man
a
momentary
temptation
such
as
you
yourself
would
have
yielded
to
at
my
age
said
oscar
to
moreau
has
made
me
commit
a
fault
which
desroches
thinks
serious
though
it
is
only
a
peccadillo
i
am
more
provoked
with
myself
for
taking
florentine
of
the
gaiete
for
a
marquise
than
i
am
for
losing
fifteen
hundred
francs
after
a
little
debauch
in
which
everybody
even
godeschal
was
over
this
time
at
any
rate
i
ve
hurt
no
one
by
myself
i
m
cured
of
such
things
forever
if
you
are
willing
to
help
me
monsieur
moreau
i
swear
to
you
that
the
six
years
i
must
still
stay
a
clerk
before
i
can
get
a
practice
shall
be
spent
without
stop
there
said
moreau
i
have
three
children
and
i
can
make
no
never
mind
never
mind
said
madame
clapart
to
her
son
casting
a
reproachful
glance
at
moreau
your
uncle
cardot
i
have
no
longer
an
uncle
cardot
replied
oscar
who
related
the
scene
at
the
rue
de
vendome
madame
clapart
feeling
her
legs
give
way
under
the
weight
of
her
body
staggered
to
a
chair
in
the
where
she
fell
as
if
struck
by
lightning
all
the
miseries
together
she
said
as
she
fainted
moreau
took
the
poor
mother
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
bed
in
her
chamber
oscar
remained
motionless
as
if
crushed
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
said
moreau
coming
back
to
him
but
to
make
yourself
a
soldier
that
idiot
of
a
clapart
looks
to
me
as
though
he
couldn
t
live
three
months
and
then
your
mother
will
be
without
a
penny
ought
i
not
therefore
to
reserve
for
her
the
little
money
i
am
able
to
give
it
was
impossible
to
tell
you
this
before
her
as
a
soldier
you
ll
eat
plain
bread
and
reflect
on
life
such
as
it
is
to
those
who
are
born
into
it
without
i
may
get
a
lucky
number
said
oscar
suppose
you
do
what
then
your
mother
has
well
fulfilled
her
duty
towards
you
she
gave
you
an
education
she
placed
you
on
the
right
road
and
secured
you
a
career
you
have
left
it
now
what
can
you
do
without
money
nothing
as
you
know
by
this
time
you
are
not
a
man
who
can
begin
a
new
career
by
taking
off
your
coat
and
going
to
work
in
your
with
the
tools
of
an
artisan
besides
your
mother
loves
you
and
she
would
die
to
see
you
come
to
oscar
sat
down
and
no
longer
restrained
his
tears
which
flowed
copiously
at
last
he
understood
this
language
so
completely
unintelligible
to
him
ever
since
his
first
fault
men
without
means
ought
to
be
perfect
added
moreau
not
suspecting
the
profundity
of
that
cruel
sentence
my
fate
will
soon
be
decided
said
oscar
i
draw
my
number
the
day
after
between
now
and
then
i
will
decide
upon
my

deeply
distressed
in
spite
of
his
stern
bearing
left
the
household
in
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
to
its
despair
three
days
later
oscar
drew
the
number
in
the
interests
of
the
poor
lad
the
former
steward
of
presles
had
the
courage
to
go
to
the
comte
de
serizy
and
ask
for
his
influence
to
get
oscar
into
the
cavalry
it
happened
that
the
count
s
son
having
left
the
ecole
polytechnique
rather
low
in
his
class
was
appointed
as
a
favor
in
a
regiment
of
cavalry
commanded
by
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
oscar
had
therefore
in
his
great
misfortune
the
small
luck
of
being
at
the
comte
de
serizy
s
instigation
drafted
into
that
noble
regiment
with
the
promise
of
promotion
to
quartermaster
within
a
year
chance
had
thus
placed
the
under
the
command
of
the
son
of
the
comte
de
serizy
madame
clapart
after
languishing
for
some
days
so
keenly
was
she
affected
by
these
catastrophes
became
a
victim
to
the
remorse
which
seizes
upon
many
a
mother
whose
conduct
has
been
frail
in
her
youth
and
who
in
her
old
age
turns
to
repentance
she
now
considered
herself
under
a
curse
she
attributed
the
sorrows
of
her
second
marriage
and
the
misfortunes
of
her
son
to
a
just
retribution
by
which
god
was
compelling
her
to
expiate
the
errors
and
pleasures
of
her
youth
this
opinion
soon
became
a
certainty
in
her
mind
the
poor
woman
went
for
the
first
time
in
forty
years
to
confess
herself
to
the
abbe
gaudron
vicar
of
s
who
led
her
into
the
practice
of
devotion
but
so
and
loving
a
soul
as
that
of
madame
clapart
s
could
never
be
anything
but
simply
pious
the
aspasia
of
the
directory
wanted
to
expiate
her
sins
in
order
to
draw
down
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
head
of
her
poor
oscar
and
she
henceforth
vowed
herself
to
works
and
deeds
of
the
purest
piety
she
believed
she
had
won
the
attention
of
heaven
when
she
saved
the
life
of
monsieur
clapart
who
thanks
to
her
devotion
lived
on
to
torture
her
but
she
chose
to
see
in
the
tyranny
of
that
imbecile
mind
a
trial
inflicted
by
the
hand
of
one
who
loveth
while
he
chasteneth
oscar
meantime
behaved
so
well
that
in
he
was
first
sergeant
of
the
company
of
the
vicomte
de
serizy
which
gave
him
the
rank
of
of
the
line
oscar
husson
was
by
that
time
years
old
as
the
royal
guard
to
which
his
regiment
was
attached
was
always
in
garrison
in
paris
or
within
a
circumference
of
thirty
miles
around
the
capital
he
came
to
see
his
mother
from
time
to
time
and
tell
her
his
griefs
for
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
he
could
never
become
an
officer
as
matters
then
were
at
that
time
the
cavalry
grades
were
all
being
taken
up
by
the
younger
sons
of
noble
families
and
men
without
the
article
to
their
names
found
promotion
difficult
oscar
s
sole
ambition
was
to
leave
the
guards
and
be
appointed
in
a
regiment
of
the
cavalry
of
the
line
in
the
month
of
february
madame
clapart
obtained
this
promotion
for
her
son
through
the
influence
of
madame
la
dauphine
granted
to
the
abbe
gaudron
now
rector
of
although
oscar
outwardly
professed
to
be
devoted
to
the
bourbons
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
was
a
liberal
therefore
in
the
struggle
of
he
went
over
to
the
side
of
the
people
this
desertion
which
had
an
importance
due
to
the
crisis
in
which
it
took
place
brought
him
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
during
the
excitement
of
triumph
in
the
month
of
august
he
was
promoted
lieutenant
received
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
was
attached
as
to
la
fayette
who
gave
him
the
rank
of
captain
in
when
the
amateur
of
the
best
of
all
possible
republics
was
removed
from
the
command
of
the
national
guard
oscar
husson
whose
devotion
to
the
new
dynasty
amounted
to
fanaticism
was
appointed
major
of
a
regiment
sent
to
africa
at
the
time
of
the
first
expedition
undertaken
by
the
the
vicomte
de
serizy
chanced
to
be
the
of
this
regiment
at
the
affair
of
the
makta
where
the
field
had
to
be
abandoned
to
the
arabs
monsieur
de
serizy
was
left
wounded
under
a
dead
horse
oscar
discovering
this
called
out
to
the
squadron
messieurs
it
is
going
to
death
but
we
can
not
abandon
our
he
dashed
upon
the
enemy
and
his
electrified
soldiers
followed
him
the
arabs
in
their
first
astonishment
at
this
furious
and
return
allowed
oscar
to
seize
the
viscount
whom
he
flung
across
his
horse
and
carried
off
at
full
gallop
receiving
as
he
did
so
two
slashes
from
yataghans
on
his
left
arm
oscar
s
conduct
on
this
occasion
was
rewarded
with
the
officer
s
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
by
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
he
took
the
most
affectionate
care
of
the
vicomte
de
serizy
whose
mother
came
to
meet
him
on
the
arrival
of
the
regiment
at
toulon
where
as
we
know
the
young
man
died
of
his
wounds
the
comtesse
de
serizy
had
not
separated
her
son
from
the
man
who
had
shown
him
such
devotion
oscar
himself
was
so
seriously
wounded
that
the
surgeons
whom
the
countess
had
brought
with
her
from
paris
thought
best
to
amputate
his
left
arm
thus
the
comte
de
serizy
was
led
not
only
to
forgive
oscar
for
his
painful
remarks
on
the
journey
to
presles
but
to
feel
himself
his
debtor
on
behalf
of
his
son

buried

chapter
xi
oscar
s
last
blunder
some
years
after
the
affair
at
makta
an
old
lady
dressed
in
black
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
man
about
years
of
age
in
whom
observers
would
recognize
a
retired
officer
from
the
loss
of
an
arm
and
the
rosette
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
his
was
standing
at
eight
o
clock
one
morning
in
the
month
of
may
under
the
of
the
lion
d
argent
rue
de
faubourg
waiting
apparently
for
the
departure
of
a
diligence
undoubtedly
pierrotin
the
master
of
the
line
of
coaches
running
through
the
valley
of
the
oise
despatching
one
through
and
to
beaumont
would
scarcely
have
recognized
in
this
bronzed
and
maimed
officer
the
little
oscar
husson
he
had
formerly
taken
to
presles
madame
husson
at
last
a
widow
was
as
little
recognizable
as
her
son
clapart
a
victim
of
fieschi
s
machine
had
served
his
wife
better
by
death
than
by
all
his
previous
life
the
idle
lounger
was
hanging
about
as
usual
on
the
boulevard
du
temple
gazing
at
the
show
when
the
explosion
came
the
poor
widow
was
put
upon
the
pension
list
made
expressly
for
the
families
of
the
victim
at
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
the
coach
to
which
were
harnessed
four
horses
that
would
have
done
honor
to
the
was
divided
into
three
compartments
coupe
interieur
and
rotonde
with
an
imperiale
above
it
resembled
those
diligences
called
gondoles
which
now
ply
in
rivalry
with
the
railroad
between
paris
and
versailles
both
solid
and
light
and
lined
with
fine
blue
cloth
and
furnished
with
blinds
of
a
moorish
pattern
and
cushions
of
red
morocco
the
swallow
of
the
oise
could
carry
comfortably
nineteen
passengers
pierrotin
now
about
years
old
was
little
changed
still
dressed
in
a
blue
blouse
beneath
which
he
wore
a
black
suit
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
superintended
the
two
porters
in
livery
who
were
stowing
away
the
luggage
in
the
great
imperiale
are
your
places
taken
he
said
to
madame
clapart
and
oscar
eyeing
them
like
a
man
who
is
trying
to
recall
a
likeness
to
his
memory
yes
two
places
for
the
interieur
in
the
name
of
my
servant
bellejambe
replied
oscar
he
must
have
taken
them
last
ah
monsieur
is
the
new
collector
of
beaumont
said
pierrotin
you
take
the
place
of
monsieur
margueron
s
nephew
yes
replied
oscar
pressing
the
arm
of
his
mother
who
was
about
to
speak
the
officer
wished
to
remain
unknown
for
a
time
just
then
oscar
thrilled
at
hearing
the
voice
of
georges
marest
calling
out
from
the
street
pierrotin
have
you
one
seat
left
it
seems
to
me
you
could
say
monsieur
without
cracking
your
throat
replied
the
master
of
the
line
of
coaches
of
the
valley
of
the
oise
sharply
unless
by
the
sound
of
the
voice
oscar
could
never
have
recognized
the
individual
whose
jokes
had
been
so
fatal
to
him
georges
almost
bald
retained
only
three
or
four
tufts
of
hair
above
his
ears
but
these
were
elaborately
frizzed
out
to
conceal
as
best
they
could
the
nakedness
of
the
skull
a
fleshiness
in
other
words
a
stomach
altered
the
once
elegant
proportions
of
the
man
now
almost
ignoble
in
appearance
and
bearing
georges
exhibited
the
traces
of
disasters
in
love
and
a
life
of
debauchery
in
his
blotched
skin
and
bloated
vinous
features
the
eyes
had
lost
the
brilliancy
the
vivacity
of
youth
which
chaste
or
studious
habits
have
the
virtue
to
retain
dressed
like
a
man
who
is
careless
of
his
clothes
georges
wore
a
pair
of
shabby
trousers
with
straps
intended
for
varnished
boots
but
his
were
of
leather
and
of
many
months
wear
a
faded
waistcoat
a
cravat
pretentiously
tied
although
the
material
was
a
foulard
bespoke
the
secret
distress
to
which
a
former
dandy
sometimes
falls
a
prey
moreover
georges
appeared
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
in
an
evening
coat
instead
of
a
surtout
a
sure
diagnostic
of
actual
poverty
this
coat
which
had
seen
long
service
at
balls
had
now
like
its
master
passed
from
the
opulent
ease
of
former
times
to
daily
work
the
seams
of
the
black
cloth
showed
whitening
lines
the
collar
was
greasy
long
usage
had
frayed
the
edges
of
the
sleeves
into
fringes
and
yet
georges
ventured
to
attract
attention
by
yellow
kid
gloves
rather
dirty
it
is
true
on
the
outside
of
which
a
signet
ring
defined
a
large
dark
spot
round
his
cravat
which
was
slipped
into
a
pretentious
gold
ring
was
a
chain
of
silk
representing
hair
which
no
doubt
held
a
watch
his
hat
though
worn
rather
jauntily
revealed
more
than
any
of
the
above
symptoms
the
poverty
of
a
man
who
was
totally
unable
to
pay
sixteen
francs
to
a
being
forced
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
the
former
admirer
of
florentine
twirled
a
cane
with
a
chased
gold
knob
which
was
horribly
battered
the
blue
trousers
the
waistcoat
of
a
material
called
scotch
stuff
a
cravat
and
a
cotton
shirt
expressed
in
the
midst
of
all
this
ruin
such
a
latent
desire
to
that
the
contrast
was
not
only
a
sight
to
see
but
a
lesson
to
be
learned
and
that
is
georges
said
oscar
in
his
own
mind
a
man
i
left
in
possession
of
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
has
monsieur
pierrotin
a
place
in
the
coupe
asked
georges
ironically
replying
to
pierrotin
s
rebuff
no
my
coupe
is
taken
by
a
peer
of
france
the
of
monsieur
moreau
monsieur
le
baron
de
canalis
his
wife
and
his

have
nothing
left
but
one
place
in
the
the
devil
so
peers
of
france
still
travel
in
your
coach
do
they
said
georges
remembering
his
adventure
with
the
comte
de
serizy
well
i
ll
take
that
place
in
the
he
cast
a
glance
of
examination
on
oscar
and
his
mother
but
did
not
recognize
them
oscar
s
skin
was
now
bronzed
by
the
sun
of
africa
his
moustache
was
very
thick
and
his
whiskers
ample
the
hollows
in
his
cheeks
and
his
strongly
marked
features
were
in
keeping
with
his
military
bearing
the
rosette
of
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
missing
arm
the
strict
propriety
of
his
dress
would
all
have
diverted
georges
recollections
of
his
former
victim
if
he
had
had
any
as
for
madame
clapart
whom
georges
had
scarcely
seen
ten
years
devoted
to
the
exercise
of
the
most
severe
piety
had
transformed
her
no
one
would
ever
have
imagined
that
that
gray
sister
concealed
the
aspasia
of
an
enormous
old
man
very
simply
dressed
though
his
clothes
were
good
and
substantial
in
whom
oscar
recognized

leger
here
came
slowly
and
heavily
along
he
nodded
familiarly
to
pierrotin

appeared
by
his
manner
to
pay
him
the
respect
due
in
all
lands
to
millionaires

more
and

georges
to

curtly

of
the
habitual
follies
of
those
who
have
fallen
in
the
world
is
to
recognize
and
desire
the
recognition
of
others
you
are
much
changed
said
the
now
twice
a
millionaire
all
things
change
said
georges
look
at
the
lion
d
argent
and
pierrotin
s
coach
they
are
not
a
bit
like
what
they
were
fourteen
years
pierrotin
now
controls
the
whole
service
of
the
valley
of
the
oise
replied
monsieur
leger
and
sends
out
five
coaches
he
is
the
bourgeois
of
beaumont
where
he
keeps
a
hotel
at
which
all
the
diligences
stop
and
he
has
a
wife
and
daughter
who
are
not
a
bad
help
to
an
old
man
of
seventy
here
came
out
of
the
hotel
and
joined
the
group
of
travellers
who
were
waiting
to
get
into
the
coach
come
along
papa
reybert
said
leger
we
are
only
waiting
now
for
your
great
here
he
comes
said
the
steward
of
presles
pointing
to
joseph
bridau
neither
georges
nor
oscar
recognized
the
illustrious
artist
for
his
face
had
the
worn
and
haggard
lines
that
were
now
famous
and
his
bearing
was
that
which
is
given
by
success
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
adorned
his
black
coat
and
the
rest
of
his
dress
which
was
extremely
elegant
seemed
to
denote
an
expedition
to
some
rural
fete
at
this
moment
a
clerk
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
came
out
of
the
office
which
was
now
in
the
former
kitchen
of
the
lion
d
argent
and
stood
before
the
empty
coupe
monsieur
and
madame
de
canalis
three
places
he
said
then
moving
to
the
door
of
the
interieur
he
named
consecutively
monsieur
bellejambe
two
places
monsieur
de
reybert
three
places
monsieur
your
name
if
you
please
he
said
to
georges
georges
marest
said
the
fallen
man
in
a
low
voice
the
clerk
then
moved
to
the
rotunde
before
which
were
grouped
a
number
of
nurses
and
petty
shopkeepers
who
were
bidding
each
other
adieu
then
after
bundling
in
the
six
passengers
he
called
to
four
young
men
who
mounted
to
the
imperial
after
which
he
cried
start
pierrotin
got
up
beside
his
driver
a
young
man
in
a
blouse
who
called
out
pull
to
his
animals
and
the
vehicle
drawn
by
four
horses
brought
at
roye
mounted
the
rise
of
the
faubourg
at
a
slow
trot
but
no
sooner
had
it
got
above
than
it
raced
like
a
to
which
it
reached
in
forty
minutes
no
stop
was
made
at
the
inn
and
the
coach
took
the
road
through
the
valley
of
montmorency
it
was
at
the
turn
into
this
road
that
georges
broke
the
silence
which
the
travellers
had
so
far
maintained
while
observing
each
other
we
go
a
little
faster
than
we
did
fifteen
years
ago
hey
pere
leger
he
said
pulling
out
a
silver
watch
persons
are
usually
good
enough
to
call
me
monsieur
leger
said
the
millionaire
why
here
s
our
blagueur
of
the
famous
journey
to
presles
cried
joseph
bridau
have
you
made
any
new
campaigns
in
asia
africa
or
america
sacrebleu
i
ve
made
the
revolution
of
july
and
that
s
enough
for
me
for
it
ruined
ah
you
made
the
revolution
of
july
cried
the
painter
laughing
well
i
always
said
it
never
made
how
people
meet
again
said
monsieur
leger
turning
to
monsieur
de
reybert
this
papa
reybert
is
the
clerk
of
the
notary
to
whom
you
undoubtedly
owe
the
stewardship
of
we
lack
mistigris
now
famous
under
his
own
name
of
leon
de
lora
said
joseph
bridau
and
the
little
young
man
who
was
stupid
enough
to
talk
to
the
count
about
those
skin
diseases
which
are
now
cured
and
about
his
wife
whom
he
has
recently
left
that
he
may
die
in
and
the
count
himself
you
lack
him
said
old
reybert
i
m
afraid
said
joseph
bridau
sadly
that
the
last
journey
the
count
will
ever
take
will
be
from
presles
to
to
be
present
at
my
he
still
drives
about
the
park
said
reybert
does
his
wife
come
to
see
him
asked
leger
once
a
month
replied
reybert
she
is
never
happy
out
of
paris
last
september
she
married
her
niece
mademoiselle
du
rouvre
on
whom
since
the
death
of
her
son
she
spends
all
her
affection
to
a
very
rich
young
pole
the
comte
to
whom
asked
madame
clapart
will
monsieur
de
serizy
s
property
go
to
his
wife
who
will
bury
him
replied
georges
the
countess
is
still
for
a
woman
of
years
of
age
she
is
very
elegant
and
at
a
little
distance
gives
one
the
illusion
she
will
always
be
an
illusion
to
you
said
leger
who
seemed
inclined
to
revenge
himself
on
his
former
hoaxer
i
respect
her
said
georges
but
by
the
bye
what
became
of
that
steward
whom
the
count
turned
off
moreau
said
leger
why
he
s
the
deputy
from
the
ha
the
famous
centre
man
moreau
de
l
oise
cried
georges
yes
returned
leger
moreau
de
l
oise
he
did
more
than
you
for
the
revolution
of
july
and
he
has
since
then
bought
the
beautiful
estate
of
pointel
between
presles
and
next
to
the
count
s
said
georges
i
call
that
very
bad
don
t
speak
so
loud
said
monsieur
de
reybert
for
madame
moreau
and
her
daughter
the
baronne
de
canalis
and
the
baron
himself
the
former
minister
are
in
the
what
dot
could
he
have
given
his
daughter
to
induce
our
great
orator
to
marry
her
said
georges
something
like
two
millions
replied
old
leger
he
always
had
a
taste
for
millions
remarked
georges
he
began
his
pile
surreptitiously
at
presles
say
nothing
against
monsieur
moreau
cried
oscar
hastily
you
ought
to
have
learned
before
now
to
hold
your
tongue
in
public
joseph
bridau
looked
at
the
officer
for
several
seconds
then
he
said
smiling
monsieur
is
not
an
ambassador
but
his
rosette
tells
us
he
has
made
his
way
nobly
my
brother
and
general
giroudeau
have
repeatedly
named
him
in
their
oscar
husson
cried
georges
faith
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
your
voice
i
should
never
have
known
ah
it
was
monsieur
who
so
bravely
rescued
the
vicomte
jules
de
serizy
from
the
arabs
said
reybert
and
for
whom
the
count
has
obtained
the
collectorship
of
beaumont
while
awaiting
that
of
pontoise
yes
monsieur
said
oscar
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
monsieur
said
the
great
painter
of
being
present
at
my
marriage
at
whom
do
you
marry
asked
oscar
after
accepting
the
invitation
mademoiselle
leger
replied
joseph
bridau
the
granddaughter
of
monsieur
de
reybert
monsieur
le
comte
was
kind
enough
to
arrange
the
marriage
for
me
as
an
artist
i
owe
him
a
great
deal
and
he
wished
before
his
death
to
secure
my
future
about
which
i
did
not
think
whom
did
pere
leger
marry
asked
georges
my
daughter
replied
monsieur
de
reybert
and
without
a
ah
said
georges
assuming
a
more
respectful
manner
toward
monsieur
leger
i
am
fortunate
in
having
chosen
this
particular
day
to
do
the
valley
of
the
oise
you
can
all
be
useful
to
me
how
so
asked
monsieur
leger
in
this
way
replied
georges
i
am
employed
by
the
esperance
a
company
just
formed
the
statutes
of
which
have
been
approved
by
an
ordinance
of
the
king
this
institution
gives
at
the
end
of
ten
years
dowries
to
young
girls
annuities
to
old
men
it
pays
the
education
of
children
and
takes
charge
in
short
of
the
fortunes
of
i
can
well
believe
it
said
pere
leger
smiling
in
a
word
you
are
a
runner
for
an
insurance
no
monsieur
i
am
the
charged
with
the
duty
of
establishing
correspondents
and
appointing
the
agents
of
the
company
throughout
france
i
am
only
operating
until
the
agents
are
selected
for
it
is
a
matter
as
delicate
as
it
is
difficult
to
find
honest
but
how
did
you
lose
your
thirty
thousand
a
year
asked
oscar
as
you
lost
your
arm
replied
the
son
of
curtly
then
you
must
have
shared
in
some
brilliant
action
remarked
oscar
with
a
sarcasm
not
unmixed
with
bitterness
parbleu
i
ve
too
many
shares
that
s
just
what
i
wanted
to
by
this
time
they
had
arrived
at
where
all
the
passengers
got
out
while
the
coach
changed
horses
oscar
admired
the
liveliness
which
pierrotin
displayed
in
unhooking
the
traces
from
the
while
his
driver
cleared
the
reins
from
the
leaders
poor
pierrotin
thought
he
he
has
stuck
like
me
not
far
advanced
in
the
world
georges
has
fallen
low
all
the
others
thanks
to
speculation
and
to
talent
have
made
their
fortune
do
we
breakfast
here
pierrotin
he
said
aloud
slapping
that
worthy
on
the
shoulder
i
am
not
the
driver
said
pierrotin
what
are
you
then
asked
colonel
husson
the
proprietor
replied
pierrotin
come
don
t
be
vexed
with
an
old
acquaintance
said
oscar
motioning
to
his
mother
but
still
retaining
his
patronizing
manner
don
t
you
recognize
madame
clapart
it
was
all
the
nobler
of
oscar
to
present
his
mother
to
pierrotin
because
at
that
moment
madame
moreau
de
l
oise
getting
out
of
the
coupe
overheard
the
name
and
stared
disdainfully
at
oscar
and
his
mother
my
faith
madame
said
pierrotin
i
should
never
have
known
you
nor
you
either
monsieur
the
sun
burns
black
in
africa
doesn
t
it
the
species
of
pity
which
oscar
thus
felt
for
pierrotin
was
the
last
blunder
that
vanity
ever
led
our
hero
to
commit
and
like
his
other
faults
it
was
punished
but
very
gently
thus
two
months
after
his
official
installation
at
oscar
was
paying
his
addresses
to
mademoiselle
georgette
pierrotin
whose
dot
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
he
married
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
proprietor
of
the
of
the
oise
toward
the
close
of
the
winter
of
the
adventure
of
the
journey
to
presles
was
a
lesson
to
oscar
husson
in
discretion
his
disaster
at
florentine
s
strengthened
him
in
honesty
and
uprightness
the
hardships
of
his
military
career
taught
him
to
understand
the
social
hierarchy
and
to
yield
obedience
to
his
lot
becoming
wise
and
capable
he
was
happy
the
comte
de
serizy
before
his
death
obtained
for
him
the
collectorship
at
pontoise
the
influence
of
monsieur
moreau
de
l
oise
and
that
of
the
comtesse
de
serizy
and
the
baron
de
canalis
secured
in
after
years
a
for
monsieur
husson
in
whom
the
camusot
family
now
recognize
a
relation
oscar
is
a
commonplace
man
gentle
without
assumption
modest
and
always
keeping
like
his
government
to
a
middle
course
he
excites
neither
envy
nor
contempt

short
he
