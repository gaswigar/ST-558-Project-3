three
nice
old
ladies
and
a
criminal
who

are
discussing

over

the
criminal
who
is
the
hostess
calls
it
a
dish
of
tea
which
shows
that
she
comes
from
caledonia
but
that
is
not
her
crime
they
are
all
london
charwomen
but
three
of
them
including
the
hostess
are
what
are
called
professionally
or
simply
an
is
also
a
caretaker
when
required
her
name
is
entered
as
such
in
ink
in
a
registry
book
financial
transactions
take
place
across
a
counter
between
her
and
the
registrar
and
altogether
she
is
of
a
very
different
social
status
from
one
who
like
haggerty
is
a
charwoman
but
nothing
else
haggerty
though
present
is
not
at
the
party
by
invitation
having
seen
dowey
buying
the
winkles
she
followed
her
downstairs
so
has
shuffled
into
the
play
and
sat
down
in
it
against
our
wish
we
would
remove
her
by
force
or
at
least
print
her
name
in
small
letters
were
it
not
that
she
takes
offence
very
readily
and
says
that
nobody
respects
her
so
as
you
have
slipped
in
you
sit
there
haggerty
but
keep
quiet
there
is
nothing
doing
at
present
in
the
caretaking
way
for
dowey
our
hostess
but
this
does
not
damp
her
caretaking
being
only
to
such
as
she
an
extra
financially
and
a
halo
socially
if
she
had
the
honour
of
being
served
with
an
paper
she
would
probably
fill
in
one
of
the
nasty
little
compartments
with
the
words
charring
profession
if
any
caretaking
this
home
of
hers
from
which
to
look
after
your
house
she
makes
occasionally
temporary
departures
in
great
style
escorting
a
barrow
is
in
one
of
those
streets
that
you
discover
only
when
you
have
lost
your
way
on
discovering
them
your
duty
is
to
report
them
to
the
authorities
who
immediately
add
them
to
the
map
of
london
that
is
why
we
are
now
reporting
friday
street
we
shall
call
it
in
the
rough
sketch
drawn
for
press
in
which
the
criminal
resided
and
you
will
find
dowey
home
therein
marked
with
a
x
her
abode
really
consists
of
one
room
but
she
maintains
that
there
are
two
so
rather
than
argue
let
us
say
that
there
are
two
the
other
one
has
no
window
and
she
could
not
swish
her
old
skirts
in
it
without
knocking
something
over
its
grandest
display
is
of
tin
pans
and
crockery
on
top
of
a
dresser
which
has
a
lid
to
it
you
have
but
to
whip
off
the
utensils
and
raise
the
lid
and
behold
a
bath
with
hot
and
cold
dowey
is
very
proud
of
this
possession
and
when
she
shows
it
off
as
she
does
perhaps
too
frequently
she
first
signs
to
you
with
closed
fist
funny
old
thing
that
she
is
to
approach
softly
she
then
tiptoes
to
the
dresser
and
pops
off
the
lid
as
if
to
take
the
bath
unawares
then
she
sucks
her
lips
and
is
modest
if
you
have
the
grace
to
do
the
exclamations
in
the
real
room
is
a
bed
though
that
is
putting
the
matter
too
briefly
the
fair
way
to
begin
if
you
love
dowey
is
to
say
to
her
that
it
is
a
pity
she
has
no
bed
if
she
is
in
her
best
form
she
will
chuckle
and
agree
that
the
want
of
a
bed
tries
her
sore
she
will
keep
you
on
the
hooks
so
to
speak
as
long
as
she
can
and
then
with
that
movement
again
she
will
suddenly
spring
the
bed
on
you
you
thought
it
was
a
wardrobe
but
she
brings
it
down
from
the
wall
and
lo
a
bed
there
is
nothing
else
in
her
abode
which
we
now
see
to
contain
four
rooms
kitchen
pantry
bedroom
and
bathroom
that
is
absolutely
a
surprise
but
it
is
full
of
every
one
of
which
has
been
paid
ready
money
for
and
gloated
over
and
tended
until
it
has
become
part
of
its
owner
genuine
doweys
the
dealers
might
call
them
though
there
is
probably
nothing
in
the
place
except
the
bed
that
would
fetch
her
home
is
in
the
basement
so
that
the
view
is
restricted
to
the
lower
half
of
persons
passing
overhead
beyond
the
area
stairs
here
at
the
window
dowey
sometimes
sits
of
a
summer
evening
gazing
not
sentimentally
at
a
which
contains
one
poor
bulb
nor
yearningly
at
some
tiny
speck
of
sky
but
with
unholy
relish
at
holes
in
stockings
and
the
like
which
are
revealed
to
her
from
her
point
of
vantage
you
gentle
reader
may
flaunt
by
thinking
that
your
finery
awes
the
street
but
dowey
can
tell
and
does
that
your
soles
are
in
need
of
neat
repair
also
lower
parts
being
as
expressive
as
the
face
to
those
whose
view
is
thus
limited
she
could
swear
to
scores
of
the
in
a
court
of
law
these
four
lively
old
codgers
are
having
a
good
time
at
the
and
wit
is
flowing
free
as
you
can
see
by
their
everyday
garments
and
by
their
pails
and
mops
which
are
having
a
little
by
themselves
in
the
corner
it
is
not
a
gathering
by
invitations
stretching
away
into
yesterday
it
is
a
purely
informal
affair
so
much
more
attractive
do
you
think
than
banquets
elaborately
prearranged
you
know
how
they
come
about
especially
in
very
likely
dowey
met
twymley
and
mickleham
quite
casually
in
the
street
and
meant
to
do
no
more
than
the
time
of
day
then
naturally
enough
the
word
camouflage
was
mentioned
and
they
got
heated
but
in
the
end
twymley
apologised
then
in
the
odd
way
in
which
one
thing
leads
to
another
the
winkle
man
appeared
and
dowey
remembered
that
she
had
that
pot
of
jam
and
that
mickleham
had
stood
treat
last
time
and
soon
they
were
all
three
descending
the
area
stairs
followed
cringingly
by
the
haggerty
woman
they
have
been
extremely
merry
and
never
were
four
old
ladies
who
deserved
it
better
all
a
woman
can
do
in
they
do
daily
and
cheerfully
just
as
their
are
doing
it
at
the
front
and
now
with
the
mops
and
pails
laid
aside
they
sprawl
gracefully
at
ease
there
is
no
intention
on
their
part
to
consider
peace
terms
until
a
decisive
victory
has
been
gained
in
the
field
sarah
ann
dowey
until
the
kaiser
is
put
to
the
emma
mickleham
and
singing
very
small
amelia
twymley
at
this
the
lady
who
is
to
play
the
part
of
dowey
is
sure
to
want
to
suggest
that
our
heroine
has
a
secret
sorrow
namely
the
crime
but
you
should
see
us
knocking
that
idea
out
of
her
head
dowey
knows
she
is
a
criminal
but
unlike
the
actress
she
does
not
know
that
she
is
about
to
be
found
out
and
she
is
to
put
it
bluntly
in
her
own
scotch
way
the
merriest
of
the
whole
clanjamfry
she
presses
more
tea
on
her
guests
but
they
wave
her
away
from
them
in
the
pretty
manner
of
ladies
who
know
that
they
have
already
had
more
than
enough
dowey
one
more
winkle
mrs
mickleham
indeed
there
is
only
one
more
but
mickleham
indicates
politely
that
if
she
took
this
one
it
would
have
to
swim
for
it
the
haggerty
woman
takes
it
long
afterwards
when
she
thinks
erroneously
that
no
one
is
looking
twymley
is
sulking
evidently
some
one
has
contradicted
her
probably
the
haggerty
woman
twymley
say
it
is
so
the
haggerty
woman
say
it
may
be
so
twymley
suppose
i
ought
to
know
me
that
has
a
son
a
prisoner
in
germany
she
has
so
obviously
scored
that
all
good
feeling
seems
to
call
upon
her
to
end
here
but
she
continues
rather
shabbily
the
only
lady
present
that
has
that
proud
misfortune
the
others
are
stung
dowey
son
is
fighting
in
france
mickleham
is
wounded
in
two
places
the
haggerty
woman
is
at
salonaiky
the
absurd
pronunciation
of
this
uneducated
person
moves
the
others
to
mirth
dowey
excuse
us
haggerty
but
the
correct
pronunciation
is
salonikky
the
haggerty
woman
to
cover
her
confusion
do
think
she
feels
that
even
this
does
not
prove
her
case
i
speak
as
one
that
has
war
savings
certificates
twymley
all
have
them
the
haggerty
woman
whimpers
and
the
other
guests
regard
her
with
unfeeling
disdain
dowey
to
restore
cheerfulness
it
a
terrible
war
all
brightening
is
you
may
say
so
dowey
encouraged
i
say
is
the
men
is
splendid
but
none
so
easy
about
the
staff
that
your
weak
point
mrs
mickleham
mickleham
on
the
defence
but
determined
to
reveal
nothing
that
might
be
of
use
to
the
enemy
may
take
it
from
me
the
staff
all
right
dowey
very
relieved
i
am
to
hear
you
say
it
it
is
here
that
the
haggerty
woman
has
the
remaining
winkle
mickleham
do
understand
properly
about
trench
warfare
if
i
had
a
map
dowey
wetting
her
finger
to
draw
lines
on
the
table
the
river
sommy
now
if
we
had
barrages
here
twymley
soon
you
would
be
enfilided
where
your
supports
my
lady
dowey
is
damped
mickleham
none
of
you
grasps
is
that
this
is
a
artillery
war
the
haggerty
woman
strengthened
by
the
winkle
say
that
the
word
is
salonaiky
the
others
purse
their
lips
twymley
with
terrible
meaning
change
the
subject
have
you
seen
this
week
she
has
evidently
seen
and
devoured
it
herself
and
even
licked
up
the
crumbs
gabardine
with
accordion
pleats
has
quite
gone
out
dowey
her
old
face
sparkling
sakes
you
tell
me
twymley
with
the
touch
of
haughtiness
that
comes
of
great
topics
plain
smock
has
come
in
again
with
silk
lacing
giving
that
charming
chic
effect
dowey
mickleham
must
say
i
was
always
partial
to
the
straight
line
thoughtfully
regarding
the
want
of
line
in
person
trying
to
them
as
is
of
too
friendly
a
figure
it
is
here
that
the
haggerty
woman
fingers
close
unostentatiously
upon
a
piece
of
sugar
twymley
sailing
into
the
empyrean

seen
conversing
across

one
of

was
very
impudent
of
her

meekly
it
was
mickleham
trying
to
look
modest
with
indifferent
success
had
a
letter
from
my
son
percy

photo
the
haggerty
woman
from
salonaiky

less
common
three
bosoms

but
not
alas
dowey
nevertheless
she
doggedly
knits
her
lips
dowey
the
criminal
writes
to
me
every
week
there
are
exclamations
the
dauntless
old
thing
holds
aloft
a
packet
of
letters
at
this
all
his
the
haggerty
woman
whimpers
twymley
has
little
time
for
writing
being
a
bombardier
dowey
relentlessly
your
letters
begin
dear
mother
twymley
mickleham
the
haggerty
woman
time
dowey
delivering
the
blow
begin
dearest
mother
no
one
can
think
of
the
right
reply
twymley
doing
her
best
short
man
i
should
say
judging
by
yourself
she
ought
to
have
left
it
alone
dowey
feet
a
half
the
gloom
deepens
mickleham
against
her
better
judgment
kilty
did
you
tell
me
dowey
certainly
he
in
the
famous
black
watch
the
haggerty
woman
producing
her
handkerchief
surrey
rifles
is
the
famousest
mickleham
you
and
the
king
disagrees
haggerty
his
choice
is
the
buffs
same
as
my
percy
twymley
magnanimously
me
the
and
you
can
keep
all
the
rest
dowey
sure
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
surreys
and
the
and
the
buffs
but
they
are
just
breeches
regiments
i
understand
the
haggerty
woman
ca
all
be
kilties
dowey
crushingly
very
true
twymley
it
is
foolish
of
her
but
she
ca
help
saying
it
your
kenneth
great
hairy
legs
dowey
the
wicked
woman
but
let
us
also
say
sarah
ann
dowey
for
at
this
moment
enter
nemesis
in
other
words
the
less
important
part
of
a
clergyman
appears
upon
the
stair
mickleham
the
reverent
gent
dowey
little
knowing
what
he
is
bringing
her
see
he
has
had
his
boots
heeled
it
may
be
said
of
willings
that
his
happy
smile
always
walks
in
front
of
him
this
smile
makes
music
of
his
life
it
means
that
once
again
he
has
been
chosen
in
his
opinion
as
the
central
figure
in
romance
no
one
can
well
have
led
a
more
drab
existence
but
he
will
never
know
it
he
will
always
think
of
himself
humbly
though
elatedly
as
the
chosen
of
the
gods
of
him
must
it
have
been
originally
written
that
adventures
are
for
the
adventurous
he
meets
them
at
every
street
corner
for
instance
he
assists
an
old
lady
off
a
bus
and
asks
her
if
he
can
be
of
any
further
help
she
tells
him
that
she
wants
to
know
the
way
to
maddox
the
butcher
then
comes
the
kind
triumphant
smile
it
always
comes
first
followed
by
its
explanation
was
there
yesterday
this
is
the
merest
sample
of
the
adventures
that
keep
willings
up
to
the
mark
since
the
war
broke
out
his
zest
for
life
has
become
almost
terrible
he
can
scarcely
lift
a
newspaper
and
read
of
a
hero
without
remembering
that
he
knows
some
one
of
the
name
the
soldiers
rest
he
is
connected
with
was
once
a
china
emporium
and
mark
my
words
he
had
bought
his
tea
service
at
it
such
is
life
when
you
are
in
the
thick
of
it
sometimes
he
feels
that
he
is
part
of
a
gigantic
spy
drama
in
the
course
of
his
extraordinary
comings
and
goings
he
meets
with
great
personages
of
course
and
is
the
confidential
recipient
of
secret
news
before
imparting
the
news
he
does
not
as
you
might
expect
first
smile
expansively
on
the
contrary
there
comes
over
his
face
an
awful
solemnity
which
however
means
the
same
thing
when
divulging
the
names
of
the
personages
he
first
looks
around
to
make
sure
that
no
suspicious
character
is
about
and
then
lowering
his
voice
tells
you
had
that
from
farthing
himself
he
is
the
secretary
of
the
bethnal
green
branch
there
is
a
commotion
about
finding
a
worthy
chair
for
the
reverent
and
there
is
also
some
furtive
pulling
down
of
sleeves
but
he
stands
surveying
the
ladies
through
his
triumphant
smile
this
amazing

slightly
or

a
little
on
its
stem
now
good

twymley
glad
mrs
dowey
dowey
sure
willings
sure
he
has

in
london
willings
is
i
have
spoken
to
him
mickleham
lucky
woman
they
might
see
that
she
is
not
looking
lucky
but
experience
has
told
them
how
differently
these
things
take
people
willings
marvelling
more
and
more
as
he
unfolds
his
tale
it
is
quite
a
romance
i
was
in
the
he
looks
around
cautiously
but
he
knows
that
they
are
all
to
be
trusted
the
church
army
quarters
in
central
street
trying
to
get
on
the
track
of
one
or
two
of
our
missing
men
suddenly
my
eyes
i
ca
account
for
it
but
suddenly
my
eyes
alighted
on
a
highlander
seated
rather
drearily
on
a
bench
with
his
kit
at
his
feet
the
haggerty
woman
big
man
willings
great
brawny
fellow
the
haggerty
woman
groans
my
friend
i
said
at
once
welcome
back
to
blighty
i
make
a
point
of
calling
it
blighty
i
wonder
i
said
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
he
shook
his
head
what
regiment
i
asked
here
willings
very
properly
lowers
his
voice
to
a
whisper
black
watch
battalion
he
said
name
i
asked
dowey
he
said
mickleham
declare
i
do
declare
willings
showing
how
the
thing
was
done
with
the
help
of
a
chair
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
as
it
might
be
thus
kenneth
dowey
i
said
i
know
your
mother
dowey
wetting
her
lips
did
he
say
to
that
willings
was
incredulous
indeed
he
seemed
to
think
i
was
balmy
but
i
offered
to
bring
him
straight
to
you
i
told
him
how
much
you
had
talked
to
me
about
him
dowey
him
here
mickleham
wonder
he
needed
to
be
brought
willings
had
just
arrived
and
was
bewildered
by
the
great
city
he
listened
to
me
in
the
taciturn
scotch
way
and
then
he
gave
a
curious
laugh
twymley
willings
whose
wild
life
has
brought
him
into
contact
with
the
strangest
people
scotch
twymley
express
their
emotions
differently
from
us
with
them
tears
signify
a
rollicking
mood
while
merriment
denotes
that
they
are
plunged
in
gloom
when
i
had
finished
he
said
at
once
let
us
go
and
see
the
old
lady
dowey
backing
which
is
the
first
movement
she
has
made
since
he
began
his
tale
he
coming
willings
gloriously
has
come
he
is
up
there
i
told
him
i
thought
i
had
better
break
the
joyful
news
to
you
three
women
rush
to
the
window
dowey
looks
at
her
pantry
door
but
perhaps
she
remembers
that
it
does
not
lock
on
the
inside
she
stands
rigid
though
her
face
has
gone
very
grey
dowey
get
them
to
go
away
willings
i
think
this
happy
occasion
scarcely
requires
you
he
is
not
the
man
to
ask
of
woman
a
sacrifice
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
make
himself
also
am
going
instantly
they
all
survey
dowey
and
understand
or
think
they
understand
twymley
pail
and
mop
in
hand
would
thank
none
for
their
company
if
my
alfred
was
at
the
door
mickleham
similarly
burdened
same
from
me
shall
i
send
him
down
mrs
dowey
the
old
lady
does
not
hear
her
she
is
listening
terrified
for
a
step
on
the
stairs
at
the
poor
joyous
thing
sir
she
has
his
letters
in
her
hand
the
three
women
go
willings
puts
a
kind
hand
on
shoulder
he
thinks
he
so
thoroughly
understands
the
situation
willings
good
son
dowey
to
have
written
to
you
so
often
our
old
criminal
quakes
but
she
grips
the
letters
more
tightly
private
dowey
descends
my
friend
there
she
is
waiting
for
you
with
your
letters
in
her
hand
dowey
grimly
great
willings
ascends
the
stair
without
one
backward
glance
like
the
good
gentleman
he
is
and
the
doweys
are
left
together
with
nearly
the
whole
room
between
them
he
is
a
great
rough
chunk
of
scotland
howked
out
of
her
not
so
much
neatly
as
liberally
and
in
his
black
watch
uniform
all
caked
with
mud
his
kit
and
nearly
all
his
worldly
possessions
on
his
back
he
is
an
apparition
scarcely
less
fearsome
but
so
much
less
ragged
than
those
ancestors
of
his
who
trotted
with
prince
charlie
to
derby
he
stands
silent
scowling
at
the
old
lady
daring
her
to
raise
her
head
and
she
would
like
very
much
to
do
it
for
she
longs
to
have
a
first
glimpse
of
her
son
when
he
does
speak
it
is
to
jeer
at
her
you
recognise
your
loving
son
missis
the
fine
scotch
tang
of
him
she
thinks
pleased
i
wrote
so
often
but
she
thinks
he
strides
towards
her
and
seizes
the
letters
roughly
see
them
there
is
a
string
round
the
package
and
he
unties
it
and
examines
the
letters
at
his
leisure
with
much
curiosity
the
envelopes
are
in
order
all
addressed
in
pencil
to
dowey
with
the
proud
words
by
censor
on
them
but
the
letter
paper
inside
contains
not
a
word
of
writing
but
blank
paper
is
this
your
writing
in
pencil
on
the
envelope
she
nods
and
he
gives
the
matter
further
consideration
covey
told
me
you
were
a
charwoman
so
i
suppose
you
picked
the
envelopes
out
of
baskets
or
such
like
and
then
changed
the
addresses
she
nods
again
still
she
dare
not
look
up
but
she
is
admiring
his
legs
when
however
he
would
cast
the
letters
into
the
fire
she
flames
up
with
sudden
spirit
she
clutches
them
you
burn
them
letters
mister
not
real
letters
all
i
have
he
returns
to
irony
thought
you
had
a
son
never
had
a
man
nor
a
son
nor
anything
i
just
call
myself
missis
to
give
me
a
standing
it
past
my
seeing
through
he
turns
to
look
for
some
explanation
from
the
walls
she
gets
a
peep
at
him
at
last
oh
what
a
grandly
man
oh
the
stride
of
him
oh
the
noble
rage
of
him
oh
samson
had
been
like
this
before
that
woman
took
him
in
hand
he
whirls
round
on
her
made
you
do
it
was
everybody
war
mister
except
mine
she
beats
her
arms
wanted
it
to
be
my
war
too
need
to
be
plainer
and
yet
i
d
d
if
i
care
to
hear
you
you
lying
old
trickster
the
words
are
merely
what
were
to
be
expected
and
so
are
endurable
but
he
has
moved
towards
the
door
not
going
already
mister
i
just
came
to
give
you
an
ugly
piece
of
my
mind
she
holds
out
her
arms
longingly
have
gave
it
to
me
yet
have
a
cheek
she
gives
further
proof
of
it
would
drink
some
tea
i
tell
you
i
came
here
for
the
one
purpose
of
blazing
away
at
you
it
is
such
a
roaring
negative
that
it
blows
her
into
a
chair
but
she
is
up
again
in
a
moment
is
this
spirited
old
lady
could
drink
the
tea
while
you
was
blazing
away
there
winkles
there
he
turns
interestedly
towards
the
table
but
his
proud
scots
character
checks
him
which
is
just
as
well
for
what
she
should
have
said
was
that
there
had
been
winkles
me
you
just
a
common
rogue
he
seats
himself
far
from
the
table
then
out
with
it
sit
down
she
sits
meekly
there
is
nothing
she
would
not
do
for
him
you
char
i
suppose
you
are
on
your
feet
all
day
more
on
my
knees
where
you
should
be
to
me
mister
i
willing
it
go
on
you
accomplished
liar
true
that
my
name
is
dowey
enough
to
make
me
change
mine
been
charring
and
charring
and
charring
as
far
back
as
i
mind
i
been
in
london
this
twenty
years
skip
your
early
days
i
have
an
appointment
then
when
i
was
old
the
war
broke
out
could
it
affect
you
mister
that
the
thing
it
did
affect
me
it
affected
everybody
but
me
the
neighbours
looked
down
on
me
even
the
posters
on
the
walls
of
the
woman
saying
go
my
boy
leered
at
me
i
sometimes
cried
by
myself
in
the
dark
you
wo
have
a
cup
of
tea
like
the
idea
came
to
me
to
pretend
i
had
a
son
depraved
old
limmer
but
what
in
the
name
of
old
nick
made
you
choose
me
out
of
the
whole
british
army
dowey
giggles
there
is
little
doubt
that
in
her
youth
she
was
an
accomplished
flirt
mister
it
was
because
i
liked
you
best
now
woman
read
one
day
in
the
papers
in
which
he
was
assisted
by
private
dowey
battalion
black
watch
private
dowey
is
flattered
you
now
well
i
expect
that
the
only
time
i
was
ever
in
the
papers
dowey
tries
it
on
again
did
choose
you
for
that
alone
i
read
a
history
of
the
black
watch
first
to
make
sure
it
was
the
best
regiment
in
the
world
could
have
told
you
that
he
is
moving
about
now
in
better
humour
and
meeting
the
loaf
in
his
stride
he
cuts
a
slice
from
it
he
is
hardly
aware
of
this
but
dowey
knows
like
the
scotch
voice
of
you
woman
it
drummles
on
like
a
hill
burn
water
runs
by
where
i
was
born
flirting
again
be
it
teached
me
to
speak
mister
woman
canny
read
about
the
black
watch
ghostly
piper
that
plays
proudly
when
the
men
of
the
black
watch
do
well
and
prouder
when
they
fall
some
foolish
story
of
that
kind
he
has
another
careless
slice
off
the
loaf
you
could
have
been
living
here
at
that
time
or
they
would
have
guessed
i
suppose
you
flitted
it
cost
me
eleven
and
sixpence
did
you
guess
the
in
my
name
stood
for
kenneth
it
angel
whispered
it
to
me
in
my
sleep
that
the
only
angel
in
the
whole
black
business
he
chuckles
little
thought
i
would
turn
up
wheeling
suddenly
on
her
did
you
was
beginning
to
weary
for
a
sight
of
you
kenneth
word
was
that
he
helps
himself
to
butter
and
she
holds
out
the
jam
pot
to
him
but
he
haughtily
rejects
it
do
you
think
she
gives
in
now
not
a
bit
of
it
he
returns
to
sarcasm
hope
you
pleased
with
me
now
you
see
me
very
pleased
does
your
folk
live
in
scotland
living
your
mother
terrible
proud
of
you
be
going
to
them
i
had
a
skite
in
london
first
the
old
lady
sniffs
she
is
in
london
young
lady
you
jealyous
me
needna
be
she
a
young
thing
surprises
me
a
beauty
no
doubt
may
be
sure
he
tries
the
jam
a
titled
person
she
is
equally
popular
as
maid
wife
and
dowey
remembers
lady
dolly
kanister
so
familiar
to
readers
of
fashionable
gossip
and
a
very
leery
expression
indeed
comes
into
her
face
me
more
about
her
man
has
sent
me
a
lot
of
things
especially
cakes
and
a
worsted
waistcoat
with
a
loving
message
on
the
enclosed
card
the
old
lady
is
now
in
a
quiver
of
excitement
she
loses
control
of
her
arms
which
jump
excitedly
this
way
and
that
try
one
of
my
cakes
mister
me
of
my
own
making
i
thank
you
but
with
a
funny
little
run
she
is
in
the
pantry
and
back
again
she
planks
down
a
cake
before
him
at
sight
of
which
he
gapes
the
matter
tell
me
oh
tell
me
mister
exactly
the
kind
of
cake
that
her
ladyship
sends
me
dowey
is
now
a
very
glorious
old
character
indeed
the
waistcoat
right
mister
i
hope
the
black
watch
colours
pleased
you
t
was
it
you
daredna
give
my
own
name
you
see
and
i
was
always
reading
hers
in
the
papers
the
badgered
man
looms
over
her
terrible
for
the
last
time
is
there
no
getting
rid
of
you
you
angry
he
sits
down
with
a
groan
hell
give
me
some
tea
she
rushes
about
preparing
a
meal
for
him
every
bit
of
her
wanting
to
cry
out
to
every
other
bit
glory
glory
glory
for
a
moment
she
hovers
behind
his
chair
she
murmurs
he
asks
no
longer
aware
that
she
is
taking
a
liberty
she
says
kenneth
and
is
off
gleefully
for
the
but
when
his
tea
is
poured
out
and
he
has
drunk
a
saucerful
the
instinct
of
returns
to
him
between
two
bites
you
be
thinking
missis
for
one
minute
that
you
have
got
me
no
on
that
understanding
he
unbends
have
a
theatre
followed
by
a
kenneth
this
is
a
queer
first
meeting
is
woman
oh
it
is
guardedly
it
also
a
last
meeting
yes
here
to
you
you
old
mop
and
pail
atque
that
means
hail
and
farewell
you
a
scholar
scotch
there
almost
nothing
i
do
know
was
you
to
trade
glazier
orraman
any
rough
jobs
a
proper
man
to
look
at
generally
admired
an
enviable
woman
mother
oh
that
was
just
protecting
myself
from
you
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
wife
nor
grandmama
bitterly
party
never
even
knew
who
his
proud
parents
were
that
gleaming
that
true
gospel
be
praised
none
of
that
i
was
a
fool
to
tell
you
but
do
think
you
can
take
advantage
of
it
pass
the
cake
daresay
it
true
we
never
meet
again
kenneth
but
but
if
we
do
i
wonder
where
it
will
be
in
this
world
no
telling
leering
ingratiatingly
might
be
at
berlin
if
i
ever
get
to
berlin
i
believe
i
find
you
there
waiting
for
me
a
cup
of
tea
for
you
in
my
hand
and
heartily
good
tea
too
he
has
partaken
heavily
he
is
now
in
high
good
humour
we
could
come
back
by
paris
the
ladies
slapping
his
knees
to
go
to
paris
kenneth
kenneth
if
just
once
before
i
die
i
could
be
fitted
for
a
paris
gown
with
dreamy
corsage
all
alike
old
covey
we
have
a
song
about
it
he
sings
gill
is
very
ill
nothing
can
improve
her
but
to
see
the
tuileries
and
waddle
through
the
louvre
no
song
ever
had
a
greater
success
dowey
is
doubled
up
with
mirth
when
she
comes
to
when
they
both
come
to
for
there
are
a
pair
of
them
she
cries
must
learn
me
that
and
off
she
goes
in
song
also
dowey
very
ill
nothing
can
improve
her
cries
clever
kenneth
and
finishes
the
verse
dressed
up
in
a
paris
gown
to
waddle
through
the
louvre
they
fling
back
their
heads
she
points
at
him
he
points
at
her
she
says
ecstatically
legs
a
mad
remark
which
brings
him
to
his
senses
he
remembers
who
and
what
she
is
your
manners
rising
thank
you
for
my
tea
i
must
be
stepping
poor
dowey
he
is
putting
on
his
kit
are
you
living
he
sighs
the
question
but
there
a
place
called
the
hut
where
some
of
the
battalion
are
they
take
me
in
beggars
bitterly
be
choosers
never
been
here
before
if
you
knew
a
shadow
coming
over
him
it
is
to
be
in
such
a
place
without
a
friend
i
was
crazy
with
glee
when
i
got
my
leave
at
the
thought
of
seeing
london
at
last
but
after
wandering
its
streets
for
four
hours
i
would
almost
have
been
glad
to
be
back
in
the
trenches
you
knew
he
has
said
but
indeed
the
old
lady
knows
my
quandorum
too
kenneth
he
nods
sympathetically
sorry
for
you
you
poor
old
body
shouldering
his
kit
i
see
no
way
out
for
either
of
us
a
cooing
voice
says
you
not
you
at
it
again
she
knows
that
it
must
be
now
or
never
she
has
left
her
biggest
guns
for
the
end
in
her
excitement
she
is
rising
up
and
down
on
her
toes
i
heard
that
the
thing
a
man
on
leave
longs
for
more
than
anything
else
is
a
bed
with
sheets
and
a
bath
never
heard
anything
truer
into
that
pantry
kenneth
dowey
and
lift
the
and
tell
me
what
you
see
he
goes
there
is
an
awful
stillness
he
returns
impressed
a
kind
of
a
bath
could
do
yourself
there
pretty
half
at
a
time
a
woman
through
the
wall
that
would
be
very
willing
to
give
me
a
shakedown
till
your
leave
is
up
he
snorts
is
there
she
has
not
got
him
yet
but
there
is
still
one
more
gun
look
with
these
simple
words
she
lets
down
the
bed
she
says
no
more
an
effect
like
this
would
be
spoilt
by
language
fortunately
he
is
not
made
of
stone
he
thrills
word
that
the
dodge
we
need
in
the
trenches
your
bed
kenneth
he
grins
at
her
queer
old
divert
what
can
make
you
so
keen
to
be
burdened
by
a
lump
like
me
he
he
he
tell
you
i
the
commonest
kind
of
man
just
the
commonest
kind
of
old
wifie
myself
been
a
all
my
life
and
i
no
great
shakes
at
the
war
you
are
how
many
germans
have
you
killed
two
for
certain
and
there
was
no
glory
in
it
it
was
just
because
they
wanted
my
shirt
shirt
they
said
it
was
their
shirt
you
took
prisoners
once
took
half
a
dozen
but
that
was
a
poor
affair
too
could
one
man
take
half
a
dozen
in
the
usual
way
i
surrounded
them
you
just
my
ideal
easily
pleased
he
turns
again
to
the
bed
see
how
the
thing
works
he
kneads
the
mattress
with
his
fist
and
the
result
is
so
satisfactory
that
he
puts
down
his
kit
lady
if
you
really
want
me
i
bide
oh
oh
oh
her
joy
is
so
demonstrative
that
he
has
to
drop
a
word
of
warning
mind
you
i
do
accept
you
as
a
relation
for
your
personal
glory
you
can
go
on
pretending
to
the
neighbours
but
the
best
i
can
say
for
you
is
that
you
on
your
probation
i
a
cautious
character
and
we
must
see
how
you
turn
out
kenneth
now
i
think
for
that
bath
my
theatre
begins
at
a
cove
i
met
on
a
is
going
with
me
she
is
a
little
alarmed
sure
you
come
back
yes
handsomely
leave
my
kit
in
pledge
wo
liquor
up
too
freely
kenneth
the
first
chuckling
care
whether
i
do
or
not
nothing
she
has
said
has
pleased
the
lonely
man
so
much
as
this
promise
tod
i
beginning
to
look
forward
to
being
wakened
in
the
morning
by
hearing
you
cry
get
up
you
lazy
swine
i
kind
of
envied
men
that
had
womenfolk
with
the
right
to
say
that
he
is
passing
to
the
bathroom
when
a
diverting
notion
strikes
him
is
it
kenneth
theatre
it
would
be
showier
if
i
took
a
lady
dowey
feels
a
thumping
at
her
breast
tell
me
this
instant
what
you
mean
do
keep
me
on
the
jumps
he
turns
her
round
it
could
be
done
it
me
you
were
thinking
of
for
the
moment
regretfully
you
have
no
style
she
catches
hold
of
him
by
the
sleeve
in
this
of
course
but
oh
kenneth
if
you
saw
me
in
my
merino
it
laced
up
the
back
in
the
very
latest
doubtfully
let
see
it
it
is
produced
from
a
drawer
to
which
the
old
lady
runs
with
almost
indecent
haste
the
connoisseur
examines
it
critically
none
so
bad
have
you
a
bit
of
chiffon
for
the
neck
it
not
bombs
nor
kaisers
nor
tipperary
that
men
in
the
trenches
think
of
chiffon
swear
i
have
kenneth
and
i
have
a
bangle
and
a
muff
and
gloves
ay
he
considers
you
think
you
could
give
your
face
less
of
a
homely
look
sure
i
could
you
can
have
a
try
but
mind
you
i
promise
nothing
all
will
depend
on
the
effect
he
goes
into
the
pantry
and
the
old
lady
is
left
alone
not
alone
for
she
is
ringed
round
by
entrancing
hopes
and
dreadful
fears
they
beam
on
her
and
jeer
at
her
they
pull
her
this
way
and
that
with
difficulty
she
breaks
through
them
and
rushes
to
her
pail
hot
water
soap
and
a
our
last
glimpse
of
her
for
this
evening
shows
her
staring
not
discontentedly
at
her
soft
old
face
licking
her
palm
and
pressing
it
to
her
hair
her
eyes
are
sparkling
one
evening
a
few
days
later
twymley
and
mickleham
are
in
dowey
house
awaiting
that
lady
return
from
some
fashionable
dissipation
they
have
undoubtedly
been
discussing
the
war
for
the
first
words
we
catch
are
mickleham
tell
you
flat
amelia
i
bows
no
knee
to
junkerdom
twymley
here
by
the
fire
you
and
me
as
one
to
another
what
do
you
think
will
happen
after
the
war
are
we
to
go
back
to
being
as
we
were
mickleham
for
myself
amelia
not
me
the
war
has
wakened
me
up
to
a
understanding
of
my
own
importance
that
is
really
astonishing
twymley
here
instead
of
being
the
poor
worms
the
like
of
you
and
me
thought
we
was
we
turns
out
to
be
visible
departments
of
a
great
and
haughty
empire
they
are
well
under
weigh
and
with
a
little
luck
we
might
now
hear
their
views
on
various
passing
problems
of
the
day
such
as
the
neglect
of
science
in
our
public
schools
but
in
comes
the
haggerty
woman
and
spoils
everything
she
is
attired
like
them
in
her
best
but
the
effect
of
her
is
that
her
clothes
have
gone
out
for
a
walk
leaving
her
at
home
mickleham
with
deep
distaste
that
submarine
again
the
haggerty
woman
cringes
to
them
but
gets
no
encouragement
the
haggerty
woman
a
terrible
war
twymley
that
so
the
haggerty
woman
wonder
what
will
happen
when
it
ends
mickleham
have
no
idea
the
intruder
produces
her
handkerchief
but
does
not
use
it
after
all
she
is
in
her
best
the
haggerty
woman
they
not
back
yet
perfect
ladies
must
reply
to
a
direct
question
mickleham
icily
have
been
waiting
this
half
hour
they
are
at
the
theatre
again
the
haggerty
woman
tell
me
i
just
popped
in
with
an
insignificant
present
for
him
as
his
leave
is
up
twymley
same
errand
brought
us
the
haggerty
woman
present
is
cigarettes
they
have
no
intention
of
telling
her
what
their
presents
are
but
the
secret
leaps
from
them
mickleham
is
mine
twymley
too
triumph
of
the
haggerty
woman
but
it
is
mickleham
has
gold
tips
twymley
has
mine
the
haggerty
woman
need
not
say
a
word
you
have
only
to
look
at
her
to
know
that
her
cigarettes
are
not
she
tries
to
brazen
it
out
which
is
so
often
a
mistake
the
haggerty
woman
care
i
mine
is
exquisytos
no
wonder
they
titter
mickleham
us
haggerty
if
that
your
name
but
the
word
is
exquiseetos
the
haggerty
woman
obliged
weeps
mickleham
think
i
heard
a
taxi
twymley
will
be
her
third
this
week
they
peer
through
the
blind
they
are
so
excited
that
rank
is
forgotten
the
haggerty
woman
is
she
in
mickleham
new
astrakhan
jacket
he
gave
her
with
venus
sleeves
the
haggerty
woman
she
sold
her
gabardine
coat
mickleham
her
she
has
them
both
at
the
theatre
warm
night
though
it
is
she
wearing
the
astrakhan
and
carrying
the
gabardine
flung
over
her
arm
the
haggerty
woman
saw
her
strutting
about
with
him
yesterday
looking
as
if
she
thought
the
two
of
them
made
a
procession
twymley
peeping
me
dead
if
she
not
coming
mincing
down
the
stair
hooked
on
his
arm
indeed
it
is
thus
that
dowey
enters
perhaps
she
had
seen
shadows
lurking
on
the
blind
and
at
once
hooked
on
to
kenneth
to
impress
the
visitors
she
is
quite
capable
of
it
now
we
see
what
kenneth
saw
that
afternoon
five
days
ago
when
he
emerged
from
the
bathroom
and
found
the
old
trembler
awaiting
his
inspection
here
are
the
muff
and
the
gloves
and
the
chiffon
and
such
a
kind
old
bonnet
that
it
makes
you
laugh
at
once
i
do
know
how
to
describe
it
but
it
is
trimmed
with
a
kiss
as
bonnets
should
be
when
the
wearer
is
old
and
frail
we
must
take
the
merino
for
granted
until
she
steps
out
of
the
astrakhan
she
is
dressed
up
to
the
nines
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
yes
but
is
her
face
less
homely
above
all
has
she
style
the
answer
is
in
a
stout
affirmative
ask
kenneth
he
knows
many
a
time
he
has
had
to
go
behind
a
door
to
roar
hilariously
at
the
old
lady
he
has
thought
of
her
as
a
lark
to
tell
his
mates
about
by
and
by
but
for
some
reason
that
he
can
not
fathom
he
knows
now
that
he
will
never
do
that
dowey
affecting
surprise
have
visitors
dowey
servant
ladies
he
is
no
longer
and
dour
a
very
smart
figure
is
this
private
dowey
and
he
winks
engagingly
at
the
visitors
like
one
who
knows
that
for
jolly
company
you
can
not
easily
beat
charwomen
the
pleasantries
that
he
and
they
have
exchanged
this
week
the
sauce
he
has
given
them
the
wit
of
mickleham
retorts
the
badinage
of
twymley
the
neat
giggles
of
the
haggerty
woman
there
has
been
nothing
like
it
since
you
took
the
countess
in
to
dinner
twymley
should
apologise
we
not
meaning
to
stay
dowey
are
very
welcome
just
wait
the
ostentation
of
this
i
get
out
of
my
astrakhan
and
my
muff
and
my
gloves
it
is
the
bonnet
turn
now
excelsior
at
last
we
see
her
in
the
merino
a
triumph
mickleham
given
her
a
glory
time
mr
dowey
dowey
her
that
has
given
it
to
me
missis
dowey
hey
hey
hey
he
just
pampers
me
waggling
her
fists
lord
forgive
us
but
this
being
the
last
night
we
had
a
supper
at
a
restaurant
vehemently
swear
by
god
that
we
had
champagny
wine
there
is
a
dead
stillness
and
she
knows
very
well
what
it
means
she
has
even
prepared
for
it
to
them
as
doubts
my
word
here
the
cork
she
places
the
cork
in
its
lovely
gold
drapery
upon
the
table
mickleham
sure
twymley
would
thank
you
dowey
not
to
say
a
word
against
my
alfred
dowey
dowey
come
ladies
in
the
masterful
way
that
is
so
hard
for
women
to
resist
you
say
another
word
i
kiss
the
lot
of
you
there
is
a
moment
of
pleased
confusion
mickleham
them
sodgers
the
haggerty
woman
kilties
is
the
worst
twymley
sure
heartily
do
grudge
you
your
treats
dowey
and
sorry
we
are
that
this
is
the
end
dowey
it
the
end
with
a
troubled
look
at
his
old
lady
must
be
off
in
ten
minutes
the
little
soul
is
too
gallant
to
break
down
in
company
she
hurries
into
the
pantry
and
shuts
the
door
mickleham
thing
but
we
must
run
for
you
be
having
some
last
words
to
say
to
her
dowey
kept
her
out
long
on
purpose
so
as
to
have
less
time
to
say
them
in
he
more
than
half
wishes
that
he
could
make
a
bolt
to
a
twymley
the
best
way
in
the
important
affairs
of
life
there
is
not
much
that
any
one
can
teach
a
charwoman
a
mere
nothing
to
wish
you
well
mr
dowey
all
three
present
him
with
the
cigarettes
mickleham
scraping
as
one
might
say
the
haggerty
woman
heart
enigmatically
warm
though
it
may
not
be
dowey
bricks
the
ladies
luck
cocky
dowey
same
to
you
and
if
you
see
a
sodger
man
up
there
in
a
kilt
he
is
one
that
is
going
back
with
me
tell
him
not
to
come
down
but
but
to
give
me
till
the
last
minute
and
then
to
whistle
it
is
quite
a
grave
man
who
is
left
alone
thinking
what
to
do
next
he
tries
a
horse
laugh
but
that
proves
of
no
help
he
says
to
himself
but
it
is
equally
ineffective
then
he
opens
the
pantry
door
and
calls
lady
she
comes
timidly
to
the
door
her
hand
up
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
it
time
an
encouraging
voice
answers
her
no
not
yet
i
left
word
for
dixon
to
whistle
when
go
i
must
is
ended
then
you
promised
to
be
gay
we
were
to
help
one
another
kenneth
bad
for
me
but
it
worse
for
you
men
have
medals
to
win
you
see
women
have
their
medals
too
he
knows
she
likes
him
to
order
her
about
so
he
tries
it
again
here
no
i
come
to
you
he
stands
gaping
at
her
wonderingly
he
has
no
power
of
words
nor
does
he
quite
know
what
he
would
like
to
say
is
it
kenneth
a
woman
had
near
forgot
it
he
wishes
he
was
at
the
station
with
dixon
dixon
is
sure
to
have
a
bottle
in
his
pocket
they
will
be
roaring
a
song
presently
but
in
the
meantime
there
is
that
son
business
blethers
the
whole
thing
of
course
or
mostly
blethers
but
it
the
way
to
please
her
you
noticed
you
have
never
called
me
son
i
noticed
it
i
was
feared
kenneth
you
said
i
was
on
probation
so
you
were
well
the
probation
ended
he
laughs
uncomfortably
like
of
me
but
if
you
want
me
you
can
have
me
will
i
do
artfully
gay
be
so
forward
wait
till

a
mother

the
grand
style

you
queer
carl

spunky
tiddy

i
your
permission
to
ask
you
the
most
important
question

neglected
orphan

of
an
old
lady
she
bubbles
with
mirth
who
could
help

the
man

such
a
way
with
him

long
time

manner

be
proud
of

knee

scarf
sets
you
fine
was
always
my
colour
the
whistle
sounds
lady
you
are
what
blighty
means
to
me
now
she
hides
in
the
pantry
again
she
is
out
of
sight
to
us
but
she
does
something
that
makes
private
dowey
take
off
his
bonnet
then
he
shoulders
his
equipment
and
departs
that
is
he
laughing
coarsely
with
dixon
we
have
one
last
glimpse
of
the
old
lady
a
month
or
two
after
death
in
action
it
would
be
rosemary
to
us
to
see
her
in
her
black
dress
of
which
she
is
very
proud
but
let
us
rather
peep
at
her
in
the
familiar
garments
that
make
a
third
to
her
mop
and
pail
it
is
early
morning
and
she
is
having
a
look
at
her
medals
before
setting
off
on
the
daily
round
they
are
in
a
drawer
with
the
scarf
covering
them
and
on
the
scarf
a
piece
of
lavender
first
the
black
frock
which
she
carries
in
her
arms
like
a
baby
then
her
war
savings
certificates
kenneth
bonnet
a
thin
packet
of
real
letters
and
the
famous
champagne
cork
she
kisses
the
letters
but
she
does
not
blub
over
them
she
strokes
the
dress
and
waggles
her
head
over
the
certificates
and
presses
the
bonnet
to
her
cheeks
and
rubs
the
tinsel
of
the
cork
carefully
with
her
apron
she
is
a
tremulous
old
yet
she
exults
for
she
owns
all
these
things
and
also
the
penny
flag
on
her
breast
she
puts
them
away
in
the
drawer
the
scarf
over
them
the
lavender
on
the
scarf
her
air
of
triumph
well
becomes
her
she
lifts
the
pail
and
the
mop
and
slouches
off
gamely
to
the
day
toil
the
new
word
any
room
nowadays
must
be
the
scene
for
any
father
and
any
son
are
the
we
could
pick
them
up
in
mayfair
in
tooting
on
the
veldt
in
rectories
or
in
grocers
back
parlours
dump
them
down
on
our
toy
stage
and
tell
them
to
begin
it
is
a
great
gathering
to
choose
from
but
our
needs
are
small
let
the
company
shake
hands
and
all
go
away
but
two
the
two
who
have
remained
it
is
discovered
on
inquiry
are
torrance
and
his
boy
so
let
us
make
use
of
them
torrance
did
not
linger
in
order
to
be
chosen
he
was
anxious
like
all
of
them
to
be
off
but
we
recognised
him
and
sternly
signed
to
him
to
stay
not
that
we
knew
him
personally
but
the
fact
is
we
remembered
him
we
never
forget
a
face
as
the
legal
person
who
reads
out
the
names
of
the
jury
before
the
court
opens
and
who
brushes
aside
your
reasons
for
wanting
to
be
let
off
it
pleases
our
humour
to
tell
torrance
that
we
can
not
let
him
off
he
does
not
look
so
formidable
as
when
last
we
saw
him
and
this
is
perhaps
owing
to
our
no
longer
being
hunched
with
others
on
those
unfeeling
benches
it
is
not
because
he
is
without
a
wig
for
we
saw
him
on
the
occasion
to
which
we
are
so
guardedly
referring
both
in
a
wig
and
out
of
it
he
passed
behind
a
screen
without
it
and
immediately
as
quickly
as
we
write
popped
out
in
it
giving
it
a
finishing
touch
rather
like
the
butler
wriggle
to
his
coat
as
he
goes
to
the
door
there
are
the
two
kinds
of
learned
brothers
those
who
use
the
screen
and
those
who
so
far
as
the
jury
knows
sleep
in
their
wigs
the
latter
are
the
swells
and
include
the
judges
whom
however
we
have
seen
in
the
public
thoroughfares
without
their
wigs
a
horrible
sight
that
has
doubtless
led
many
an
onlooker
to
crime
torrance
then
is
no
great
luminary
indeed
when
we
accompany
him
to
his
house
as
we
must
in
order
to
set
our
scene
properly
we
find
that
it
is
quite
a
suburban
affair
only
one
servant
kept
and
her
niece
engaged
twice
a
week
to
crawl
about
the
floors
there
is
no
fire
in
the
so
the
family
remain
on
after
dinner
in
the
which
rather
gives
them
away
there
is
really
no
one
in
the
room
but
roger
that
is
the
truth
of
it
though
to
the
unseeing
eye
all
the
family
are
there
except
roger
they
consist
of
and
miss
torrance
torrance
is
enjoying
his
evening
paper
and
a
cigar
and
every
line
of
him
is
insisting
stubbornly
that
nothing
unusual
is
happening
in
the
house
in
the
home
circle
and
now
that
we
think
of
it
even
in
court
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
somewhat
sarcastic
gentleman
he
must
be
dogged
too
otherwise
he
would
have
ceased
long
ago
to
be
sarcastic
to
his
wife
on
whom
wit
falls
like
pellets
on
sandbags
all
the
dents
they
make
are
dimples
torrance
is
at
present
exquisitely
employed
she
is
listening
to
roger
step
overhead
you
know
what
a
delightful
step
the
boy
has
and
what
is
more
remarkable
is
that
emma
is
listening
to
it
too
emma
who
is
seventeen
and
who
has
been
trying
to
keep
roger
in
his
place
ever
since
he
first
compelled
her
to
bowl
to
him
things
have
come
to
a
pass
when
a
sister
so
openly
admits
that
she
is
only
number
two
in
the
house
remarks
well
worthy
of
being
recorded
fall
from
these
two
ladies
as
they
gaze
upward
think
did
i
emma
is
the
mother
contribution
while
it
is
emma
who
replies
in
a
whisper
not
yet
torrance
calmly
reads
or
seems
to
read
for
it
is
not
possible
that
there
can
be
anything
in
the
paper
as
good
as
this
indeed
he
occasionally
casts
a
humorous
glance
at
his
perhaps
he
is
trying
to
steady
them
let
us
hope
he
has
some
such
good
reason
for
breaking
in
from
time
to
time
on
their
entrancing
occupation
to
this
dear
it
is
very
important
the
paper
says
upon
apparently
good
authority
that
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
his
wife
answers
without
lowering
her
eyes
you
speak
john
i
am
listening
i
was
telling
you
that
the
hidden
hand
has
at
last
been
discovered
in
a
tub
in
russell
square
hear
john
how
thoughtful
so
they
must
have
been
made
of
margarine
my
love
should
wonder
john
the
name
petrograd
was
that
the
reason
will
be
pleased
to
hear
ellen
that
the
honourable
gentleman
then
resumed
his
seat
was
nice
of
him
i
resume
mine
having
made
my
usual
impression
john
emma
slips
upstairs
to
peep
through
a
keyhole
and
it
strikes
her
mother
that
john
has
been
saying
something
they
are
on
too
good
terms
to
make
an
apology
necessary
she
observes
blandly
i
have
heard
a
word
you
said
sure
you
have
woman
ca
help
being
like
this
john
on
being
like
yourself
dear
i
foolish
but
john
how
can
you
be
so
calm
with
him
up
there
has
been
up
there
a
good
deal
you
know
since
we
presented
him
to
an
astounded
world
nineteen
years
ago
he
he
is
not
going
to
be
up
there
much
longer
john
she
sits
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
so
openly
to
wheedle
him
that
it
is
not
worth
his
while
to
smile
her
voice
is
tremulous
she
is
a
woman
who
can
conceal
nothing
will
be
nice
to
him
wo
you
john
torrance
is
a
little
pained
i
just
begin
ellen
no
no
but
i
think
he
is
rather
shy
of
you
at
times
he
says
a
little
wryly
because
he
is
my
son
ellen
it
strange
but
yes
with
a
twinkle
that
is
not
all
humorous
it
ever
strike
you
ellen
that
i
am
a
bit
shy
of
him
she
is
indeed
surprised
rogie
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
his
father
she
presumes
that
this
is
his
sarcasm
again
and
lets
it
pass
at
that
it
reminds
her
of
what
she
wants
to
say
are
so
sarcastic
she
has
never
quite
got
the
meaning
of
this
word
rogie
at
times
boys
do
like
that
john
that
so
ellen
course
i
do
mind
your
being
sarcastic
to
good
groaning
being
sarcastic
to
you
you
are
so
seldom
aware
of
it
am
not
asking
you
to
be
a
mother
to
him
john
you
my
dear
she
does
not
know
that
he
is
sarcastic
again
quite
understand
that
a
man
ca
think
all
the
time
about
his
son
as
a
mother
does
he
ellen
what
makes
you
so
sure
of
that
mean
that
a
boy
naturally
goes
to
his
mother
with
his
troubles
rather
than
to
his
father
rogie
tells
me
everything
torrance
is
stung
daresay
he
might
tell
me
things
he
tell
you
she
smiles
at
this
it
is
very
probably
sarcasm
want
you
to
be
serious
just
now
why
not
show
more
warmth
to
him
john
with
an
unspoken
sigh
would
terrify
him
ellen
two
men
show
warmth
to
each
other
shame
woman
men
indignantly
he
is
only
nineteen
all
patting
her
hand
it
is
the
great
age
to
be
nineteen
emma
darts
in
he
has
unlocked
the
door
he
is
taking
a
last
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
before
coming
down
having
made
the
great
announcement
she
is
off
again
wo
be
sarcastic
john
give
you
my
word
if
you
promise
not
to
break
down
rashly
promise
she
hurries
to
the
door
and
back
again
contrive
to
leave
you
and
him
alone
together
for
a
little
torrance
is
as
alarmed
as
if
the
judge
had
looked
over
the
bench
and
asked
where
he
was
god
sake
woman
do
do
that
father
and
son
he
bolt
or
if
he
does
i
will
emma
torrance
flings
open
the
door
grandly
and
we
learn
what
all
the
is
about
emma
me
to
introduce
lieutenant
torrance
of
the
royal
sussex
father
your
son
lieutenant
torrance
your
father
mother
your
little
rogie
roger
in
uniform
walks
in
strung
up
for
the
occasion
or
the
uniform
comes
forward
with
roger
inside
it
he
has
been
a
very
ordinary
nice
boy
up
to
now
dull
at
his
by
an
effort
torrance
had
sent
him
to
an
obscure
but
at
sixteen
it
was
evident
that
an
office
was
the
proper
place
for
roger
before
the
war
broke
out
he
was
treasurer
of
the
local
lawn
tennis
club
and
his
golf
handicap
was
seven
he
carried
his
little
bag
daily
to
and
from
the
city
and
his
highest
relaxation
was
giggling
with
girls
or
about
them
socially
he
had
fallen
from
the
standards
of
the
home
even
now
that
he
is
in
his
uniform
the
hasty
might
say
something
clever
about
gentlemen
but
there
are
great
ideas
buzzing
in
roger
head
which
would
never
have
been
there
save
for
the
war
at
present
he
is
chiefly
conscious
of
his
clothes
his
mother
embraces
him
with
cries
of
rapture
while
torrance
surveys
him
quizzically
over
the
paper
and
emma
rushing
to
the
piano
which
is
of
such
an
kind
that
it
can
also
be
used
as
a
sideboard
plays
the
conquering
hero
comes
roger
in
an
agony
do
stop
that
chit
making
an
ass
of
me
he
must
be
excused
for
his
that
was
the
sort
of
school
and
his
mother
is
rather
proud
of
the
phrase
though
it
sometimes
makes
his
father
wince
torrance
please
do
but
i
sure
you
deserve
it
my
darling
does
he
john
torrance
missing
his
chance
yet
you
know
ca
be
exactly
a
conquering
hero
the
first
night
you
put
them
on
can
you
roger
roger
hotly
i
say
i
was
torrance
john
do
turn
round
rogie
i
never
did
i
never
did
emma
he
a
pet
roger
up
emma
torrance
challenging
the
world
i
say
it
who
should
and
yet
why
should
i
torrance
any
case
you
will
so
go
ahead
mater
torrance
knew
he
would
look
splendid
but
i
of
course
i
could
know
that
he
would
look
quite
so
splendid
as
this
roger
know
i
look
a
bally
ass
that
is
why
i
was
such
a
time
in
coming
down
torrance
thought
we
heard
you
upstairs
strutting
about
torrance
do
mind
him
rogie
roger
haughtily
do
torrance
roger
i
was
strutting
torrance
dreadful
sword
no
i
would
prefer
you
not
to
draw
it
dear
not
till
necessity
makes
you
torrance
come
ellen
that
rather
hard
lines
on
the
boy
if
he
is
to
draw
it
here
where
is
he
to
draw
it
emma
with
pride
the
front
father
torrance
thought
they
left
them
at
home
nowadays
roger
roger
mater
you
see
they
are
a
bit
in
the
way
torrance
foolishly
when
you
have
got
used
to
them
torrance
is
what
roger
means
his
son
glares
emma
who
though
she
has
not
formerly
thought
much
of
roger
is
now
proud
to
trot
by
his
side
and
will
henceforth
count
the
salutes
know
what
he
means
if
you
carry
a
sword
the
snipers
know
you
are
an
officer
and
they
try
to
pick
you
off
torrance
no
wonder
they
are
called
huns
fancy
a
british
sniper
doing
that
roger
you
will
be
very
careful
wo
you
in
the
trenches
roger
bright
mater
torrance
all
do
look
up
torrance
trenches
ought
to
be
so
deep
that
they
ca
look
up
torrance
a
good
idea
john
roger
making
game
of
you
mater
torrance
unruffled
he
my
own
very
likely
now
about
the
question
of
provisions
roger
lummy
you
talk
as
if
i
was
going
off
i
may
go
for
months
and
months
torrance
know
and
of
course
there
is
a
chance
that
you
may
not
be
needed
at
all
roger
poor
boy
of
that
mater
torrance
is
something
i
want
to
ask
you
john
how
long
do
you
think
the
war
is
likely
to
last
her
john
resumes
his
paper
i
know
you
will
laugh
at
me
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
could
not
help
getting
for
you
roger
know
you
have
knitted
enough
things
already
to
fit
up
my
whole
platoon
torrance
proud
almost
to
tears
platoon
emma
you
noticed
how
fine
all
the
words
in
are
platoon
dragoon
torrance
emma
is
good
but
rather
papaish
major
is
nosey
admiral
of
the
fleet
is
scrumptious
but
marechal
de
france
that
is
the
best
of
all
torrance
think
there
is
nothing
so
nice
as
lieutenant
gulping
of
little
boys
roger
torrance
mean
just
think
of
their
cold
feet
she
produces
many
parcels
and
displays
their
strange
contents
are
for
putting
inside
your
socks
those
are
for
outside
your
socks
i
am
told
that
it
is
also
advisable
to
have
straw
in
your
boots
torrance
you
got
him
some
straw
torrance
thought
john
he
could
get
it
there
but
if
you
think
roger
making
fun
of
you
again
mater
torrance
should
wonder
here
are
some
overalls
one
is
leather
and
one
fur
and
this
one
is
waterproof
the
worst
of
it
is
that
they
are
from
different
shops
and
each
says
that
the
others
keep
the
damp
in
or
draw
the
feet
they
have
such
odd
names
too
there
are
new
names
for
everything
nowadays
vests
are
called
cuirasses
are
you
laughing
at
me
rogie
torrance
sharply
he
is
laughing
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
roger
barking
was
laughing
torrance
emma
cuffs
her
father
playfully
torrance
very
well
emma
but
it
past
your
bedtime
emma
indignantly
ca
expect
me
to
sleep
on
a
night
like
this
torrance
can
try
torrance
lieutenant
lieutenant
torrance
alarmed
do
break
down
you
promised
torrance
am
not
going
to
break
down
but
but
there
is
a
photograph
of
rogie
when
he
was
very
small
torrance
to
bed
torrance
happen
to
have
it
in
my
pocket
roger
bring
it
out
mater
torrance
i
break
down
john
it
wo
be
owing
to
the
picture
itself
so
much
as
because
of
what
is
written
on
the
back
she
produces
it
dolefully
torrance
do
look
at
the
back
he
takes
it
from
her
torrance
not
very
hopeful
of
herself
i
know
what
is
written
on
the
back
roger
john
torrance
aged
two
years
four
months
and
pounds
torrance
she
weeps
softly
there
woman
he
signs
imploringly
to
emma
emma
kissing
him
going
to
mammy
rog
she
is
about
to
offer
him
her
cheek
then
salutes
instead
and
rushes
off
with
roger
in
pursuit
torrance
shall
leave
you
together
john
torrance
half
liking
it
but
nervous
you
think
it
wise
with
a
groan
know
what
i
am
torrance
be
nice
to
him
dear
roger
return
finds
her
very
artful
indeed
wonder
where
i
put
my
glasses
roger
look
for
them
torrance
i
remember
now
they
are
upstairs
in
such
a
funny
place
that
i
must
go
myself
do
you
remember
rogie
that
i
hoped
they
would
reject
you
on
account
of
your
eyes
roger
suppose
you
could
help
it
torrance
beaming
on
her
husband
you
believe
i
really
meant
it
john
torrance
curious
roger
roger
course
did
you
father
torrance
i
knew
the
old
lady
better
he
takes
her
hand
torrance
sweetly
should
have
liked
it
rogie
dear
tell
you
something
you
know
your
brother
harry
died
when
he
was
seven
to
you
i
suppose
it
is
as
if
he
had
never
been
you
were
barely
five
roger
do
remember
him
mater
torrance
no
but
i
do
rogie
he
would
be
now
but
though
you
and
emma
grew
up
i
have
always
gone
on
seeing
him
as
just
seven
always
till
the
war
broke
out
and
now
i
see
him
a
man
of
dressed
in
khaki
fighting
for
his
country
same
as
you
i
would
have
had
one
of
you
stay
at
home
though
i
had
had
a
dozen
that
is
if
it
is
the
noble
war
they
all
say
it
is
i
not
clever
rogie
i
have
to
take
it
on
trust
surely
they
would
deceive
mothers
i
get
my
glasses
she
goes
away
leaving
the
father
and
son
somewhat
moved
it
is
torrance
who
speaks
first
gruffly
to
change
your
mother
roger
the
answer
is
also
gruff
do
think
then
silence
falls
these
two
are
very
conscious
of
being
together
without
so
much
as
the
tick
of
a
clock
to
help
them
the
father
clings
to
his
cigar
sticks
his
knife
into
it
studies
the
leaf
tries
crossing
his
legs
another
way
the
son
examines
the
pictures
on
the
walls
as
if
he
had
never
seen
them
before
and
is
all
the
time
edging
toward
the
door
torrance
wets
his
lips
it
must
be
now
or
never
going
roger
roger
counts
the
chairs
i
thought
you
sit
down
and
have
a
chat
roger
is
bowled
over
what
you
and
me
not
rather
truculently
oh
all
right
sitting
uncomfortably
the
cigar
gets
several
more
stabs
suppose
you
catch
an
early
train
i
have
at
six
hours
before
i
shall
be
up
suppose
so
you
need
dwell
on
it
roger
indignantly
did
he
starts
up
father
damn
come
back
my
fault
did
i
say
i
wanted
to
have
a
chat
with
you
thought
we
had
had
it
gloomingly
such
luck
there
is
another
pause
a
frightened
ember
in
the
fire
makes
an
appeal
to
some
one
to
say
something
torrance
rises
it
is
now
he
who
is
casting
eyes
at
the
door
he
sits
again
ashamed
of
himself
like
your
uniform
roger
he
says
pleasantly
roger
wriggles
you
made
fun
of
me
enough
sharply
not
making
fun
of
you
do
you
see
i
trying
to
tell
you
that
i
proud
of
you
roger
is
at
last
aware
of
it
with
a
sinking
he
appeals
lord
father
are
not
going
to
begin
now
the
father
restrains
himself
you
remember
roger
my
saying
that
i
did
want
you
to
smoke
till
you
were
twenty
it
that
is
it
shutting
his
mouth
tight
never
promised
almost
with
a
shout
not
that
then
kindly
a
cigar
my
boy
a
rather
shaky
hand
passes
him
a
cigar
case
roger
selects
from
it
and
lights
up
nervously
he
is
now
prepared
for
the
worst
you
ever
wondered
roger
what
sort
of
a
fellow
i
am
guardedly
torrance
casts
all
sense
of
decency
to
the
winds
such
is
one
of
the
effects
of
war
have
often
wondered
what
sort
of
fellow
you
are
roger
we
have
both
been
at
it
on
the
sly
i
suppose
that
is
what
makes
a
father
and
son
so
uncomfortable
in
each
other
presence
roger
is
not
yet
prepared
to
meet
him
but
he
casts
a
line
you
feel
the
creeps
when
you
are
left
alone
with
me
roger
my
first
instinct
is
to
slip
away
is
mine
with
deep
feeling
do
say
so
with
such
surprise
that
the
father
undoubtedly
goes
up
a
step
in
the
son
estimation
always
seem
to
know
what
you
are
thinking
roger
you
same
here
a
consequence
it
is
better
it
is
right
it
is
only
decent
that
you
and
i
should
be
very
chary
of
confidences
with
each
other
roger
is
relieved
dashed
glad
you
see
it
in
that
way
quite
and
yet
roger
if
you
had
to
answer
this
question
on
oath
whom
do
you
think
you
are
most
like
in
this
world
i
do
mean
superficially
but
deep
down
in
your
vitals
what
would
you
say
your
mother
your
uncle
one
of
your
friends
on
the
golf
links
darkly
how
i
feel
there
is
such
true
sympathy
in
the
manly
avowal
that
roger
can
not
but
be
brought
closer
to
his
father
pretty
ghastly
father
is
i
do
know
which
it
is
worse
for
they
consider
each
other
without
bitterness
are
a
bit
of
a
wag
at
times
roger
soon
shut
me
up
have
heard
that
you
sparkle
more
freely
in
my
absence
say
the
same
about
you
now
that
you
mention
it
i
believe
it
is
true
and
yet
is
it
a
bigger
satisfaction
to
you
to
catch
me
relishing
your
jokes
than
any
other
person
roger
eyes
open
wide
did
you
know
that
i
am
so
bucked
if
i
see
you
relishing
mine
you
roger
hold
on
the
certain
things
in
life
are
slipping
do
show
it
is
because
of
our
awkward
relationship
roger
lapses
into
gloom
have
got
to
go
through
with
it
his
father
kicks
the
coals
no
way
out
have
as
it
were
signed
a
compact
roger
never
to
let
on
that
we
care
for
each
other
as
gentlemen
we
must
stick
to
it
what
are
you
getting
at
father
is
a
war
on
roger
need
make
any
difference
it
does
roger
be
ready
i
hate
to
hit
you
without
warning
going
to
cast
a
grenade
into
the
middle
of
you
it
this
i
fond
of
you
my
boy
roger
squirms
if
any
one
were
to
hear
you
wo
the
door
is
shut
amy
is
gone
to
bed
and
all
is
quiet
in
our
street
wo
you
wo
you
say
something
civil
to
me
in
return
roger
roger
looks
at
him
and
away
from
him
sometimes
bragged
about
you
at
school
torrance
is
absurdly
pleased
you
what
sort
of
things
roger
i
forget
on
roger
this
fair
father
i
suppose
it
is
torrance
attacks
the
coals
again
and
your
mother
have
lots
of
confidences
have
you
tell
her
a
good
deal
somehow
somehow
one
can
with
the
artfulness
that
comes
of
years
glad
you
tell
her
everything
roger
looks
down
his
cigar
everything
father
there
are
things
about
oneself
there
roger
not
to
tell
her
yes
if
there
are
any
of
them
you
would
care
to
tell
me
instead
just
if
you
want
to
mind
just
if
you
are
in
a
hole
or
anything
thanks
very
stiffly
little
debts
for
instance
all
right
now
mother
did
roger
is
ready
to
jump
at
him
was
willing
to
speak
to
you
about
them
but
said
not
worth
while
bothering
father
did
you
know
i
have
met
your
mother
before
you
see
nothing
else
been
an
ass
about
a
girl
or
anything
of
that
sort
lord
father
should
have
said
it
in
my
young
days
we
sometimes
it
all
different
now
do
know
i
could
tell
you
things
that
would
surprise
you
not
about
yourself
at
least
as
you
like
roger
blew
over
long
ago
there
no
need
oh
no
it
was
just
you
know
the
old
old
story
he
eyes
his
father
suspiciously
but
not
a
muscle
in
countenance
is
out
of
place
see
it
has
left
you
bitter
about
the
sex
roger
i
hope
now
she
you
know
what
women
are
yes
need
mention
it
to
mother
wo
torrance
is
elated
to
share
a
secret
with
roger
about
which
mother
is
not
to
know
your
mother
and
i
are
an
aged
pair
roger
never
of
course
you
are
not
young
long
have
you
known
that
i
mean
it
true
but
i
did
know
it
till
quite
lately
you
old
it
roger
not
so
bad
as
that
elderly
this
will
stagger
you
but
i
assure
you
that
until
the
other
day
i
jogged
along
thinking
of
myself
as
on
the
whole
still
one
of
the
juveniles
he
makes
a
wry
face
crossed
the
bridge
roger
without
knowing
it
made
you
know
makes
us
know
all
the
new
things
roger
the
war
i
tell
you
a
secret
when
we
realised
in
august
of
that
myriads
of
us
were
to
be
needed
my
first
thought
was
that
i
had
a
son
but
that
i
must
get
fit
myself
is
it
says
torrance
quite
nastily
as
i
tell
you
i
did
know
i
had
ceased
to
be
young
i
went
into
regent
park
and
tried
to
run
a
mile
you
might
have
killed
yourself
nearly
did
especially
as
i
had
put
a
weight
on
my
shoulders
to
represent
my
kit
i
kept
at
it
for
a
week
but
i
knew
the
game
was
up
the
discovery
was
pretty
grim
roger
you
bother
about
that
part
of
it
you
are
doing
your
share
taking
care
of
mother
and
emma
torrance
emits
a
laugh
of
am
not
taking
care
of
them
it
is
you
who
are
taking
care
of
them
my
friend
you
are
the
head
of
the
house
now
we
have
come
back
to
hard
facts
and
the
defender
of
the
house
is
the
head
of
it
fudge
true
the
thing
that
makes
me
wince
most
is
that
some
of
my
contemporaries
have
managed
to
squeeze
back
back
into
youth
roger
though
i
guess
they
were
a
pretty
tight
fit
in
the
turnstile
there
is
coxon
he
is
in
khaki
now
with
his
hair
dyed
and
when
he
and
i
meet
at
the
club
we
know
that
we
belong
to
different
generations
i
a
decent
old
fellow
but
i
do
really
count
any
more
while
coxon
lucky
dog
is
being
damned
daily
on
parade
hate
your
feeling
it
in
that
way
father
do
say
it
is
a
palatable
draught
but
when
the
war
is
over
we
shall
all
shake
down
to
the
new
conditions
no
fear
of
my
being
sarcastic
to
you
then
roger
i
have
to
be
jolly
respectful
up
father
begun
you
see
do
worry
roger
any
rawness
i
might
feel
in
having
missed
the
chance
of
seeing
whether
i
was
a
man
like
coxon
confound
him
is
swallowed
up
in
the
pride
of
giving
the
chance
to
you
i
in
a
shiver
about
you
but
it
all
true
roger
what
your
mother
said
about
lieutenants
till
the
other
day
we
were
so
little
of
a
military
nation
that
most
of
us
did
know
there
lieutenants
and
now
in
thousands
of
homes
we
feel
that
there
is
nothing
else
lieutenant
it
is
like
a
new
word
to
us
one
i
daresay
of
many
that
the
war
will
add
to
our
language
we
have
taken
to
it
roger
if
a
son
of
mine
were
to
tarnish
it
try
not
to
roger
growls
you
did
i
should
just
know
that
there
had
been
something
wrong
about
me
gruffly
all
right
i
am
you
are
it
is
a
winning
face
that
torrance
turns
on
his
son
suppose
you
have
been
asking
yourself
of
late
what
if
you
were
to
turn
out
to
be
a
funk
how
did
you
know
know
because
you
are
me
because
ever
since
there
was
talk
of
this
commission
i
have
been
thinking
and
thinking
what
were
you
thinking
so
as
to
help
you
this
itself
is
a
help
roger
hand
but
he
withdraws
it
hurriedly
all
seem
to
be
so
frightfully
brave
father
he
says
wistfully
expect
roger
that
the
best
of
them
had
the
same
qualms
as
you
before
their
first
engagement
i
kind
of
think
father
that
i
wo
be
a
funk
kind
of
think
so
too
roger
torrance
forgets
himself
you
do
be
rash
my
boy
and
for
god
sake
keep
your
head
down
in
the
trenches
roger
has
caught
him
out
he
points
a
gay
finger
at
his
anxious
father
know
you
laughed
at
mother
for
saying
that
i
roger
your
mother
thinks
that
i
have
an
unfortunate
manner
with
you
the
magnanimous
roger
says
i
do
know
it
just
the
complication
is
really
all
it
is
but
she
thinks
i
should
show
my
affection
for
you
more
openly
roger
wriggles
again
earnestly
would
do
that
nicely
course
for
this
once
but
in
a
general
way
i
would
do
that
know
you
and
i
long
as
we
know
it
no
one
else
affair
is
it
the
ticket
father
it
is
to
be
feared
that
torrance
is
now
taking
advantage
of
his
superior
slyness
before
your
mother
to
please
her
eh
faltering
suppose
it
would
what
do
you
say
know
she
would
like
it
course
you
and
i
know
that
display
of
that
sort
is
all
bunkum
repellent
even
to
our
natures
yes
to
gratify
her
should
be
so
conscious
torrance
is
here
quite
as
sincere
as
his
son
should
i
roger
considers
it
far
would
you
go
not
far
suppose
i
called
you
old
rogie
there
not
much
in
that
all
depends
on
the
way
one
says
these
things
should
be
quite
casual
what
would
you
like
me
to
call
you
severely
is
what
would
like
but
i
daresay
your
mother
would
beam
if
you
called
me
dear
father
do
think
so
know
quite
well
that
you
think
so
roger
so
effeminate
if
you
say
it
casually
with
something
very
like
a
snort
roger
asks
does
one
say
a
thing
like
that
casually
for
instance
you
could
whistle
while
you
said
it
or
anything
of
that
sort
of
course
you
if
we
were
to
be
like
that
you
would
do
anything
do
you
mean
would
paw
me
with
some
natural
indignation
forget
yourself
but
apparently
it
is
for
him
to
continue
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
heard
the
other
day
of
a
french
general
he
had
asked
for
volunteers
from
his
airmen
for
some
specially
dangerous
job
and
they
all
stepped
forward
pretty
good
that
then
three
were
chosen
and
got
their
orders
and
saluted
and
were
starting
off
when
he
stopped
them
since
when
he
said
have
brave
boys
departing
to
the
post
of
danger
omitted
to
embrace
their
father
they
did
it
then
good
story
roger
lowers
were
french
i
said
so
do
you
think
it
good
do
you
tell
it
to
me
it
a
good
story
are
sure
father
sternly
there
is
no
other
reason
torrance
tries
to
brazen
it
out
but
he
looks
guilty
know
father
that
is
barred
just
because
he
knows
that
he
has
been
playing
it
low
torrance
snaps
angrily
is
barred
know
says
his
monitor
torrance
shouts
know
that
you
are
a
young
ass
father
your
tongue
roger
can
shout
also
must
say
father
quiet
i
tell
you
it
is
in
the
middle
of
this
competition
that
the
lady
who
dotes
on
them
both
chooses
to
come
back
still
without
her
spectacles
dear
and
i
had
hoped
john
torrance
would
like
to
kick
himself
fault
he
says
with
a
groan
whatever
is
the
matter
mater
the
war
is
already
making
roger
quite
smart
father
would
do
as
i
told
him
torrance
can
not
keep
pace
with
his
son
growth
he
raps
out
the
dickens
should
i
roger
is
imperturbable
this
will
be
useful
in
france
see
mater
he
said
i
was
the
head
of
the
house
rogie
she
goes
to
her
husband
side
nonsense
roger
grins
you
like
my
joke
father
the
father
smiles
upon
him
and
is
at
once
uproariously
happy
he
digs
his
boy
boldly
in
the
ribs
you
scoundrel
better
says
torrance
at
a
venture
roger
feels
that
things
have
perhaps
gone
far
enough
think
i
go
to
my
room
now
you
will
come
up
mater
dear
i
sha
be
five
minutes
john
like
half
an
hour
she
hesitates
is
nothing
wrong

there
i
thought
i
noticed
a
a
certain
liveliness
my
dear
no
we
were
only
having
a
good
talk
about
john
wistfully
the
war
roger
breaks
in
hurriedly
tactics
and
strategy
was
it
roger
fact
is
ellen
i
have
been
helping
roger
to
take
his
first
trench
with
a
big
breath
we
took
it
too
together
did
we
roger
bet
says
roger
valiantly
i
suppose
sighing
is
one
of
those
trenches
that
the
enemy
retake
during
the
night
i
i
do
know
father
the
lady
asks
are
you
two
talking
about
says
torrance
in
high
feather
patting
her
but
unable
to
resist
a
slight
boast
is
very
private
do
tell
you
everything
you
know
ellen
she
beams
though
she
does
not
understand
on
mater
it
only
his
beastly
sarcasm
again
father
i
wo
see
you
in
the
morning
says
torrance
but
roger
has
not
gone
yet
he
seems
to
be
looking
for
something
a
book
perhaps
then
he
begins
to
whistle
casually
dear
father
john
torrance
is
left
alone
rubbing
his
hands
barbara
wedding
the
colonel
is
in
the
of
his
country
cottage
staring
through
the
open
windows
at
his
pretty
garden
he
is
a
very
old
man
and
is
sometimes
bewildered
nowadays
he
calls
to
dering
the
gardener
who
is
on
a
ladder
pruning
dering
who
comes
to
him
is
a
rough
capable
young
fellow
with
fingers
that
are
already
becoming
stumpy
because
he
so
often
uses
his
hands
instead
of
a
spade
this
is
a
sign
that
dering
will
never
get
on
in
the
world
his
mind
is
in
the
same
condition
as
his
fingers
working
back
to
clods
he
will
get
a
rise
of
one
and
sixpence
in
a
year
or
two
and
marry
on
it
and
become
duller
and
heavier
and
in
short
the
clever
ones
could
already
write
his
epitaph
beautiful
morning
dering
much
sun
sir
the
roses
be
complaining
and
to
make
matters
worse
miss
barbara
has
been
watering
of
them
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
colonel
is
a
very
gentle
knight
nowadays
she
she
means
well
but
that
is
not
what
is
troubling
him
he
approaches
the
subject
diffidently
you
heard
it
did
you
he
is
longing
to
be
told
that
dering
heard
it
was
that
sir
thunderstorm
early
this
morning
was
no
thunderstorm
sir
dispirited
is
what
they
all
say
the
colonel
is
too
courteous
to
contradict
any
one
but
he
tries
again
there
is
about
him
the
insistence
of
one
who
knows
that
he
is
right
was
at
four
i
got
up
and
looked
out
at
the
window
the
evening
primroses
were
very
beautiful
dering
is
equally
dogged
do
hold
much
with
evening
primroses
sir
but
i
was
out
and
about
at
four
there
was
no
thunderstorm
the
colonel
still
thinks
that
there
was
a
thunderstorm
but
he
wants
to
placate
dering
suppose
i
just
thought
there
was
one
perhaps
it
was
some
thunderstorm
of
long
ago
that
i
heard
they
do
come
back
you
know
heavily
they
sir
am
glad
to
see
you
moving
about
in
the
garden
dering
with
everything
just
as
usual
there
is
a
cautious
slyness
about
this
as
if
the
colonel
was
fishing
for
information
but
it
is
too
clever
for
dering
who
is
going
with
a
you
sir
do
go
the
old
man
lowers
his
voice
and
makes
a
confession
reluctantly
am
a
little
troubled
dering
dering
knows
that
his
master
has
a
wandering
mind
and
he
answers
nicely
be
all
right
sir
glad
of
that
the
colonel
says
with
relief
is
pleasant
to
see
that
you
have
come
back
dering
why
did
you
go
away
for
such
a
long
time
sir
dering
is
a
little
aggrieved
have
had
a
day
off
since
christmas
you
i
thought
the
colonel
tries
to
speak
casually
but
there
is
a
trembling
eagerness
in
his
voice
everything
just
as
usual
dering
sir
there
never
were
a
place
less
changed
than
this
true
the
colonel
is
appeased
you
dering
for
saying
that
but
next
moment
he
has
lowered
his
voice
again
there
is
nothing
wrong
is
there
is
anything
happening
that
i
am
not
being
told
about
that
i
know
of
sir
is
what
they
all
say
but
i
do
know
he
stares
at
his
old
sword
which
is
hanging
on
the
wall
i
feel
as
if
i
was
needed
somewhere
i
do
know
where
it
is
no
one
will
tell
me
where
is
every
one
all
about
sir
there
a
cricket
match
on
at
the
village
green
there
the
wind
had
a
bit
of
south
in
it
you
could
hear
their
voices
you
were
a
bit
of
a
nailer
at
cricket
yourself
sir
the
colonel
sees
himself
standing
up
to
fast
ones
he
is
gleeful
over
his
reminiscences
against
mallowfield
and
then
bowled
off
my
pads
biggest
score
i
ever
made
mallowfield
wanted
to
add
one
to
make
it
the
hundred
but
i
would
let
them
i
was
pretty
good
at
steering
them
through
the
slips
dering
do
you
remember
my
late
cut
it
did
matter
where
point
stood
i
got
past
him
you
used
to
stand
at
point
dering
was
my
grandfather
sir
if
he
was
to
be
believed
he
used
to
snap
you
regular
at
point
the
colonel
is
crestfallen
but
he
has
a
disarming
smile
he
i
daresay
he
did
i
ca
play
now
but
i
like
to
watch
it
still
he
becomes
troubled
again
there
is
no
cricket
on
the
green
i
have
been
down
to
look
i
do
understand
it
dering
when
i
got
there
the
green
was
all
dotted
with
them
it
the
prettiest
sight
and
sound
in
england
but
as
i
watched
them
they
began
to
go
away
one
and
two
at
a
time
they
were
given
out
you
know
they
went
as
if
they
had
been
called
away
some
of
the
little
shavers
stayed
on
and
then
they
went
off
as
if
they
had
been
called
away
too
the
stumps
were
left
lying
about
why
is
it
just
fancy
sir
dering
says
soothingly
saw
master
will
oiling
his
bat
yesterday
you
avidly
should
have
liked
to
see
that
i
have
often
oiled
their
bats
for
them
careless
lads
they
always
forget
was
that
nice
german
boy
with
him
karl
not
far
off
sir
he
was
sitting
by
the
bank
of
the
stream
playing
on
his
flute
and
miss
barbara
she
had
climbed
one
of
my
she
says
they
are
your
trees
he
lowers
are
you
know
dering
the
colonel
says
meekly
sir
in
a
sense
brushing
the
spurious
argument
aside
i
do
like
any
of
you
to
meddle
with
them
and
there
she
sat
pelting
the
two
of
them
with
green
apples
like
her
the
colonel
shakes
his
head
indulgently
do
know
how
we
are
to
make
a
demure
young
lady
of
her
dering
smirks
say
in
the
village
sir
that
master
will
would
like
to
try
to
the
colonel
this
is
wit
of
a
high
order
ha
he
is
just
a
colt
himself
but
the
laughter
breaks
off
he
seems
to
think
that
he
will
get
the
truth
if
dering
comes
closer
are
all
here
now
dering
in
the
house
i
mean
i
sometimes
forget
they
grow
old
so
quickly
they
go
out
at
one
door
in
the
bloom
of
youth
and
come
back
by
another
tired
and
grey
have
you
noticed
it
sir
the
only
visitors
staying
here
are
miss
barbara
and
karl
there
just
them
and
yourselves
sir
you
and
the
mistress
and
master
will
that
all
that
all
his
master
says
still
unconvinced
is
the
soldier
dering
sir
there
is
no
soldier
here
except
yourself
there
there
was
a
nurse
with
him
who
is
ill
one
sir
there
no
nurse
dering
backs
away
from
the
old
man
you
like
me
to
call
the
mistress
sir
she
has
gone
down
to
the
village
she
told
me
why
but
i
forget
miss
barbara
is
with
her
barbara
is
down
by
the
stream
sir
she
i
think
they
said

were
going
to
a
wedding
with
an
old
man
curiosity

being
married
dering
have
heard
of
no
wedding
sir
but
here
is
miss
barbara
it
is
perhaps
the
first
time
that
dering
has
been
glad
to
see
miss
barbara
who
romps
in
a
merry
hoyden
running
over
with
animal
spirits
the
tomboy
the
colonel
cries
gaily
barbara
looks
suspiciously
from
one
to
the
other
i
believe
you
are
complaining
to
the
colonel
about
my
watering
the
flowers
at
the
wrong
time
of
day
aha
the
colonel
thinks
she
is
even
wittier
than
dering
who
is
properly
abashed
did
just
mention
it
miss
horrid
barbara
shakes
her
mop
of
hair
at
the
gardener
do
mind
him
and
every
time
he
says
they
are
flowers
and
apples
you
tell
me
and
i
shall
say
to
his
face
that
they
are
courage
of
those
young
things
says
the
happy
colonel
dering
underlip
becomes
very
pronounced
but
he
goes
off
into
the
garden
barbara
attempts
to
attend
to
the
colonel
needs
me
make
you
comfy
the
way

the
way

colonel
says
softly

time

explain
those
other
people
though
the
colonel
moves
about
in
agitation

it
dear
colonel
ca
quite
remember
but
i
think
that
is
why
she
take
me

wedding
barbara
but
i
do
think
billy

is
to
be
there

wedding
billy
colonel
something
sad
about
it
barbara
ca
be

wedding
dear
granny
did
say
it
was
a
sad
wedding
did
she
colonel
was
smiling
barbara
course
she
was
colonel
i
think
that
was
only
to
please
the
nurse
barbara
nurse
again
dear
do
think
any
more
about
it
no
wedding
colonel
gently
though
he
wonders
why
they
can
go
on
deceiving
him
there
not
the
village
wedding
bells
begin
to
ring
the
colonel
is
triumphant
told
you
there
is
a
wedding
the
bells
ring
on
gaily
billy
and
barbara
take
a
step
nearer
to
each
other
but
can
go
no
closer
the
bells
ring
on
and
the
three
young
people
fade
from
the
scene
when
they
are
gone
and
he
is
alone
the
colonel
still
addresses
them
barbara
wedding
billy
boy
why
are
you
not
at
wedding
soon
the
bells
stop
he
knows
that
he
is
alone
now
but
he
does
not
understand
it
the
sun
is
shining
brightly
but
he
sits
very
cold
in
his
chair
he
shivers
he
is
very
glad
to
see
his
wife
coming
to
him
through
the
open
window
she
is
a
dear
old
lady
and
is
dressed
brightly
as
becomes
one
who
has
been
to
a
wedding
her
face
beams
to
match
her
gown
she
is
really
quite
a
happy
woman
again
for
it
is
several
years
since
any
deep
sorrow
struck
her
and
that
is
a
long
time
no
one
you
know
understands
the
colonel
as
she
does
no
one
can
soothe
him
and
bring
him
out
of
his
imaginings
as
she
can
he
hastens
to
her
he
is
no
longer
cold
that
is
her
great
reward
for
all
she
does
for
him

come
back

says

tranquilly
on
him

seemed
very
long

little
troubled

a
captain

a
very
gallant
man
john

engagement

they
knew
boy
and
karl
she
tells
him
some
more
gossip
i
had
barbara
married
from
here
because
she
has
no
people

the
thing

dering
she
has
married
he
was
once
my
gardener
world

all
being
dear
he
is
worthy
of
her
he
lets
this
pass
he
has
remembered
something
almost
as
surprising
is
barbara
a
nurse
john
and
one
of
the
staidest
and
most
serene
who
would
have
thought
it
of
the
merry
madcap
of
other
days
they
are
coming
here
john
to
say
to
you
they
have
only
a
few
days
leave
she
is
in
france
too
you
know
she
was
married
in
her
nurse
uniform
she
she
told
me
that
no
it
could
have
been

been
fancying
you

suppose

grows
tremulous
again

be
nice
to
them
john
wo
you
and
wish
them
luck
they
have
their
trials
before
them
he
says
eagerly
me
what
to
do
ellen
say
anything
about
billy
boy
john
no
let
pretend
i
would
talk
about
the
garden
john
just
in
case
he
is
a
little
touchy
about
that
the
colonel
is
beginning
to
fancy
himself
as
a
tactician
a
word
she
knows
what
is
the
way
to
put
him
on
his
mettle
see
i
sure
i
would
make
a
mess
of
it
so
i
trusting
to
you
john
he
is
very
pleased
it
all
to
me
ellen
i
be
frightfully
sly
you
just
watch
me
she
goes
to
the
window
and
calls
to
the
married
couple
captain
dering
in
khaki
is
a
fine
soldierly
figure
barbara
in
her
red
gross
uniform
is
quiet
and
resourceful
an
artful
old
boy
greets
them
barbara
no
no
none
of
your
handshaking
you
get
past
an
old
soldier
in
that
way
excuse
me
young
man
he
kisses
barbara
and
looks
at
his
wife
to
make
sure
that
she
is
admiring
him
to
you
captain
dering
you
have
won
a
prize
a
gallant
gentleman
answers
know
it
i
try
to
show
i
know
it
the
colonel
is
perturbed
have
given
barbara
a
wedding
present
ellen
i
should
like
barbara
breaks
in
you
have
dear
and
a
lovely
one
you
forgotten
granny
signs
to
the
colonel
and
he
immediately
says
with
remarkable
cunning
that
i
was
just
quizzing
you
barbara
i
hope
you
will
be
as
happy
dear
staid
barbara
as
if
you
had
married
he
sees
that
he
has
nearly
given
away
the
situation
he
looks
triumphantly
at
granny
as
much
as
to
say
me
i
not
going
to
say
a
word
about
him
granny
comes
to
his
aid
captain
dering
has
some
little
things
to
do
and
you
too
barbara
they
are
leaving
in
an
hour
john
for
a
moment
the
colonel
is
again
in
danger
you
would
like
to
take
barbara
into
the
garden
captain
dering
he
recovers
himself
instantly
not
the
garden
you
would
know
your
way
about
in
the
garden
i
colonel
the
captain
says
smiling
the
answer
is
quite
decisive
certainly
not
i
show
it
you
some
day
he
makes
gleeful
signs
to
granny
there
is
a
nice
meadow
just
beyond
the
shrubbery
barbara
knows
the
way
she
often
went
there
with
he
checks
himself
granny
signs
to
them
to
go
and
barbara
kisses
both
the
colonel
hands
captain
will
be
jealous
you
know
he
says
twinkling
me
dear
says
barbara
arranging
his
cushions
professionally
granny
nods
is
much
better
at
it
than
i
am
now
john
the
colonel
has
one
last
piece
of
advice
to
give
would
go
down
by
the
stream
barbara
not
to
the
pool
where
the
alder
is
there
there
not
a
good
view
there
sir
and
a
boy
a
boy
i
knew
he
often
nobody
in
particular
just
a
boy
who
used
to
come
about
the
house
he
is
not
here
now
he
is
on
duty
i
do
think
you
should
go
to
the
alder
pool
barbara
wo
go
there
dear
she
and
her
husband
go
out
and
the
colonel
scarcely
misses
them
he
is
so
eager
to
hear
what
his
wife
thinks
of
him
i
do
all
right
ellen
i
was
proud
of
you
he
exults
put
them
completely
off
the
scent
they
have
a
notion
i
can
be
very
sly
you
know
at
times
ellen
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
that
alder
tree
cut
down
there
is
no
boy
now
you
see
would
leave
it
alone
john
there
will
be
boys
again
shall
i
read
to
you
you
like
that
do
you
read
to
me
something
funny
if
you
please
about
sam
weller
no
i
expect
sam
has
gone
to
the
wars
read
about
pickwick
he
is
very
amusing
i
feel
sure
that
if
he
had
tried
to
catch
the
he
would
have
fallen
in
just
as
barbara
did
this
morning
is
down
at
the
alder
pool
billy
is
there
with
that
nice
german
boy
the
noise
they
make
shouting
and
laughing
she
gets
from
its
shelf
the
best
book
for
bit
shall
i
read
pickwick
going
into
the
lady
bedroom
by
mistake
dear
though
you
almost
know
it
by
heart
you
see
you
have
begun
to
laugh
already
are
laughing
too
ellen
i
ca
help
it
she
begins
to
read
they
are
both
chuckling
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
comes
the
voice
of
a
woman
speaking
to
her
dead
son
that
was
against
your
wish
was
it
not
was
that
against
your
wish
would
you
prefer
me
not
to
ask
that
question
the
room
is
so
dark
that
we
can
not
see
her
all
we
know
is
that
she
is
one
of
four
shapes
gathered
round
a
small
table
beyond
the
darkness
is
a
great
in
which
is
seated
on
a
settle
a
man
of
fifty
him
we
can
discern
fitfully
by
the
light
of
the
fire
it
is
not
sufficiently
bright
to
enable
him
to
read
but
an
evening
paper
lies
on
his
knee
he
seems
wistful
and
meek
he
is
paying
no
attention
to
the
party
round
the
table
when
he
hears
their
voices
it
is
only
as
empty
sounds
the
mother
continues
i
am
putting
the
question
in
the
wrong
way
are
you
not
able
to
tell
us
any
more
a
man
voice
breaks
in
was
a
distinct
movement
that
time
but
it
is
so
irregular
thought
so
but
please
do
talk
do
you
want
to
tell
us
more
is
it
that
you
ca
hear
me
distinctly
he
seems
to
want
to
tell
us
more
but
something
prevents
him
any
case
don
it
is
extraordinary
this
is
the
first
seance
i
have
ever
taken
part
in
but
i
must
believe
now
course
major
these
are
the
simplest
manifestations
they
are
only
the
first
step
but
if
we
are
to
go
on
the
less
we
talk
the
better
shall
we
go
on
it
is
not
agitating
you
too
much
laura
a
girl
answers
was
a
moment
when
i
but
i
wish
i
was
braver
i
think
it
is
partly
the
darkness
i
suppose
we
ca
have
a
little
light
we
can
dear
darkness
is
quite
unnecessary
but
i
think
it
helps
one
to
concentrate
the
major
lights
a
lamp
and
though
it
casts
shadows
we
see
now
that
the
room
is
an
artist
studio
the
silent
figure
in
the
is
the
artist
don
is
his
wife
the
two
men
are
major
armitage
and
an
older
friend
rogers
the
girl
is
laura
bell
these
four
are
sitting
round
the
table
their
hands
touching
they
are
endeavouring
to
commune
with
one
who
has
the
gulf
the
major
and
rogers
are
but
passing
shadows
in
the
play
and
even
nice
laura
is
only
to
flit
across
its
few
pages
for
a
moment
on
her
way
to
happier
things
we
scarcely
notice
them
in
the
presence
of
don
the
gracious
the
beautiful
the
sympathetic
whose
magnetic
force
and
charm
are
such
that
we
wish
to
sit
at
her
feet
at
once
she
is
intellectual
but
with
a
disarming
smile
religious
but
so
charitable
masterful
and
yet
loved
of
all
none
is
perfect
and
there
must
be
a
flaw
in
her
somewhere
but
to
find
it
would
necessitate
such
a
rummage
among
her
many
adornments
as
there
is
now
no
time
for
perhaps
we
may
come
upon
it
accidentally
in
the
course
of
the
play
she
is
younger
than
don
who
despite
her
efforts
for
many
years
to
cover
his
deficiencies
is
a
man
of
no
great
account
in
a
household
where
the
bigger
personality
of
his
wife
swallows
him
like
an
rod
don
deficiencies
she
used
to
try
very
hard
or
fairly
hard
to
conceal
them
from
dick
but
dick
knew
his
mother
was
his
chum
all
the
lovely
things
which
happened
in
that
house
in
the
days
when
dick
was
alive
were
between
him
and
her
those
two
shut
the
door
softly
on
old
don
always
anxious
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
and
then
ran
into
each
other
arms
in
the
better
light
don
is
now
able
to
read
his
paper
if
he
chooses
if
he
has
forgotten
the
party
at
the
table
they
have
equally
forgotten
him
don
have
not
gone
away
have
you
we
must
be
patient
are
you
still
there
rogers
think
i
felt
a
movement
don
talk
please
are
you
still
there
the
table
moves
it
is
your
mother
who
is
speaking
do
you
understand
that
the
table
moves
what
shall
i
ask
him
now
rogers
leave
it
to
you
mrs
don
don
you
any
message
you
want
to
send
us
yes
is
it
important
yes
are
we
to
spell
it
out
in
the
usual
way
yes
is
the
first
letter
of
the
first
word
a
is
it
b
she
continues
through
the
alphabet
to
l
when
the
table
responds
similarly
she
finds
that
the
second
letter
is
o
the
word
yes
but
i
do
understand
that
movement
you
are
not
displeased
with
us
are
you
no
does
the
second
word
begin
with
a
with
b
yes
the
second
word
is
spelt
out
and
the
third
bade
me
if
it
is
a
quotation
i
believe
i
know
it
is
the
fourth
word
yes
laura
bade
me
welcome
don
movement
again
do
you
want
me
to
go
on
laura

stop
don
unless
he
wishes
it
why
are
those
words
so
important

the
message
end
there
is
any
one
working
against
you
some
one
antagonistic
yes
not
one
of
ourselves
surely
no
is
it
any
one
we
know
yes
can
i
get
the
name
in
the
usual
way
yes
is
the
first
letter
of
this
person
name
a
b
it
proves
to
be
one
begins
to
notice
a
quaint
peculiarity
of
don
she
is
so
accustomed
to
homage
that
she
expects
a
prompt
response
even
from
the
shades
the
second
letter
a
the
table
moves
fa
she
is
suddenly
enlightened
the
word
father
yes
they
all
turn
and
look
for
the
first
time
at
don
he
has
heard
and
rises
apologetically
don
distressed
had
no
intention
should
i
go
away
grace
she
answers
sweetly
without
a
trace
of
the
annoyance
she
must
surely
feel
don
you
had
better
robert
rogers
suppose
it
is
because
he
is
an
unbeliever
he
is
not
openly
antagonistic
is
he
don
sadly
enough
am
afraid
he
is
they
tend
to
discuss
the
criminal
as
if
he
was
not
present
major
he
must
admit
that
we
do
get
messages
don
reluctantly
says
we
think
we
do
he
says
they
would
not
want
to
communicate
with
us
if
they
had
such
trivial
things
to
say
rogers
we
are
only
on
the
threshold
don
this
is
just
a
beginning
laura
you
hear
don
love
bade
me
welcome
don
that
strike
you
as
important
laura
laura
said
it
was
don
might
be
very
important
to
him
though
we
do
understand
why
she
speaks
gently
but
there
is
an
obstinacy
in
him
despite
his
meekness
don
did
mean
to
be
antagonistic
grace
i
thought
i
thinking
of
it
at
all
don
thinking
of
dick
robert
and
it
was
only
five
months
ago
don
who
is
somehow
without
meaning
it
always
in
the
wrong
go
rogers
boy
would
turn
his
father
out
ask
him
don
forlornly
to
that
as
to
that
don
will
ask
him
if
you
wish
me
to
robert
don
do
rogers
ca
worry
you
as
you
are
a
disbeliever
don
but
i
should
like
you
to
think
that
he
sent
me
away
rogers
wo
will
he
mrs
don
don
knowing
what
her
silence
implies
see
dick
and
i
were
not
very
no
quarrel
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
i
did
much
matter
to
dick
i
too
old
perhaps
don
gently
wo
ask
him
robert
if
you
would
prefer
me
not
to
don
go
don
afraid
it
is
too
late
now
she
turns
away
from
earthly
things
you
want
me
to
break
off
the
table
moves
do
you
send
me
your
love
dick
yes
and
to
laura
yes
she
raises
her
eyes
to
don
and
hesitates
i
ask
him
don
no
do
rogers
would
be
all
right
don
don
do
know
they
leave
the
table
laura
a
little
agitated
i
go
to
my
room
don
i
feel
i
should
like
to
be
alone
don
yes
laura
dear
i
shall
come
in
and
see
you
laura
bids
them
and
goes
she
likes
don
she
strokes
his
hand
when
he
holds
it
out
to
her
but
she
ca
help
saying
don
how
could
you
rogers
think
we
must
all
want
to
be
alone
after
such
an
evening
i
shall
say
mrs
don
major
here
i
go
your
way
rogers
but
you
will
find
me
a
silent
companion
one
does
want
to
talk
ordinary
things
rather
not
thanks
awfully
rogers
don
it
a
pity
you
know
a
bit
hard
on
your
wife
don
rogers
major
the
husband
and
wife
left
together
have
not
much
to
say
to
each
other
he
is
depressed
because
he
has
spoilt
things
for
her
she
is
not
angry
she
knows
that
he
ca
help
being
as
he
is
and
that
there
are
fine
spaces
in
her
mind
where
his
thoughts
can
never
walk
with
her
but
she
would
forgive
him
seventy
times
seven
because
he
is
her
husband
she
is
standing
looking
at
a
case
of
against
the
wall
there
is
a
jock
scott
still
sticking
in
one
of
them
don
says
as
if
somehow
they
were
evidence
against
him
she
says
forgivingly
hope
you
do
mind
my
keeping
them
in
the
studio
robert
they
are
sacred
things
to
all
right
grace
think
i
shall
go
to
laura
now
in
his
inexpressive
way
child
afraid
i
hurt
her
would
have
liked
it
but
dick
gone
she
looks
a
little
wonderingly
at
him
after
all
these
years
she
can
sometimes
wonder
a
little
still
suppose
you
will
resume
your
evening
paper
he
answers
quietly
but
with
the
noble
doggedness
which
is
the
reason
why
we
write
this
chapter
in
his
life
not
grace
she
considers
for
she
is
so
sure
that
she
must
know
the
answer
better
than
he
suppose
it
is
just
that
a
son
is
so
much
more
to
a
mother
than
to
a
father
daresay
a
little
gust
of
passion
shakes
her
you
can
read
about
the
war
nowadays
he
says
firmly
to
her
he
has
had
to
say
it
a
good
many
times
to
himself
not
going
to
give
in
but
he
adds
am
so
sorry
i
was
in
the
way
grace
i
was
scouting
you
or
anything
of
that
sort
just
that
i
ca
believe
in
it
robert
you
would
believe
if
dick
had
been
to
you
what
he
was
to
me
do
know
a
sense
you
may
be
glad
that
you
do
miss
him
in
the
way
i
do
perhaps
robert
dear
he
is
alone
now
he
stands
fingering
the
tenderly
then
wanders
back
into
the
in
the
room
we
could
scarcely
see
him
for
it
has
gone
slowly
dark
there
a
grey
darkness
as
if
the
lamp
though
still
burning
was
becoming
unable
to
shed
light
through
the
greyness
we
see
him
very
well
beyond
it
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
he
sits
on
the
settle
and
tries
to
read
his
paper
he
breaks
down
he
is
a
pitiful
lonely
man
in
the
silence
something
happens
a
voice
says
don
looks
into
the
greyness
from
which
this
voice
comes
and
he
sees
his
son
we
see
no
one
but
we
are
to
understand
that
to
don
dick
is
standing
there
in
his
habit
as
he
lived
he
goes
to
his
boy
have
come
to
sit
with
you
for
a
bit
father
it
is
the
gay
young
careless
voice
you
dick
it
you
me
all
right
father
i
say
do
be
startled
or
anything
of
that
kind
we
do
like
that
boy
evidently
dick
is
the
taller
for
don
has
to
look
up
to
him
he
puts
his
hands
on
the
boy
shoulders
am
i
looking
father
have
altered
dick
not
it
jolly
to
see
the
old
studio
again
in
a
cajoling
voice
say
father
do
fuss
let
us
be
our
ordinary
selves
you
try
i
try
you
did
say
you
had
come
to
sit
with
dick
not
with
your
mother
you
i
want
can
only
come
to
one
you
see
why
me
the
reason
he
is
evidently
moving
about
looking
curiously
at
old
acquaintances
here
your
old
jacket
greasier
than
ever
but
dick
it
is
as
if
you
had
forgotten
it
was
your
mother
who
was
everything
to
you
it
ca
be
you
if
you
have
forgotten
that
i
used
to
feel
so
out
of
it
but
of
course
you
did
know
did
know
it
till
lately
father
but
heaps
of
things
that
i
know
once
are
clear
to
me
now
i
did
know
that
you
were
the
one
who
would
miss
me
most
but
i
know
now
though
the
voice
is
as
boyish
as
ever
there
is
a
new
note
in
it
of
which
his
father
is
aware
dick
may
not
have
grown
much
wiser
but
whatever
he
does
know
now
he
seems
to
know
for
certain
miss
you
most
dick
i
try
to
paint
just
as
before
i
go
to
the
club
dick
i
have
been
to
a
i
said
i
would
give
in
like
that
my
boy
don
arms
have
gone
out
to
him
again
dick
evidently
wriggles
away
from
them
he
speaks
coaxingly
say
father
let
get
away
from
that
sort
of
thing
is
so
like
you
dick
i
do
anything
you
ask
keep
a
bright
face
tried
to
man
i
say
put
on
your
old
greasy
you
are
looking
so
beastly
clean
the
old
greasy
is
the
jacket
and
don
obediently
gets
into
it
you
like
no
that
the
wrong
sleeve
thanks
dick
they
are
in
the
now
and
the
mischievous
boy
catches
his
father
by
the
shoulders
let
me
shove
you
into
your
old
seat
don
is
propelled
on
to
the
settle
that
umpire
smiling
just
how
you
used
to
butt
me
into
it
long
ago
dick
is
probably
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
chuckling
i
was
a
kid
the
palette
in
my
hand
sticking
to
your
trousers
mess
we
made
of
ourselves
dick
sneaked
behind
the
settle
and
climbed
up
it
you
fell
off
top
of
you
and
the
palette
it
is
good
fun
for
a
father
and
son
and
the
crafty
boy
has
succeeded
in
making
the
father
laugh
but
soon
dick
the
son
frowns
he
is
not
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
then
behave
what
did
i
say
about
that
face
don
smiles
at
once
obediently
better
i
sit
here
we
see
from
his
father
face
which
is
smiling
with
difficulty
that
dick
has
plopped
into
the
big
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
his
legs
are
probably
dangling
over
one
of
its
arms
rather
sharply
your
pipe
do
i
do
seem
to
care
to
smoke
nowadays
dick
just
because
i
am
dead
you
that
pretend
to
be
plucky
i
have
it
you
know
you
get
your
pipe
and
look
slippy
about
it
dick
the
old
man
says
obediently
he
fills
his
pipe
from
a
jar
on
the
mantelshelf
we
may
be
sure
that
dick
is
watching
closely
to
see
that
he
lights
it
properly
then
burn
your
thumb
with
the
match
you
always
did
you
know
that
the
style
you
forgotten
to
cock
your
head
to
the
side
not
so
bad
that
you
like
it
rather
nice
dick
dick
you
and
me
by
the
fire
but
sit
still
how
often
we
might
have
been
like
this
father
and
were
how
is
fido
a
dog
missed
her
master
more
frowning
does
want
to
go
and
sit
on
my
grave
or
any
of
that
tosh
does
she
as
if
i
were
there
no
hastily
goes
ratting
dick
old
fido
here
a
good
one
we
ought
to
keep
a
dog
at
all
because
we
are
on
rations
now
but
what
do
you
think
fido
ate
yesterday
me
guess
the
joint
worse
than
that
she
ate
all
the
cook
meat
tickets
they
laugh
together
but
when
dick
says
dog
will
be
the
death
of
me
his
father
shivers
dick
does
not
notice
this
his
eyes
have
drawn
him
to
the
those
are
your
old
the
little
hickory
do
you
remember
father
how
i
got
the
on
a
cast
no
you
were
there
that
was
a
day
it
was
really
only
six
and
i
put
a
stone
in
its
mouth
the
second
time
we
weighed
it
loved
fishing
dick
i
why
were
you
oftener
with
me
i
tell
you
a
funny
thing
when
i
went
a
soldiering
i
used
to
pray
just
standing
up
you
know
that
i
should
lose
my
right
arm
because
it
would
be
so
awkward
for
casting
he
cogitates
as
he
returns
to
the
i
never
thought
i
should
be
killed
lots
of
fellows
thought
that
about
themselves
but
i
never
did
it
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
dick
the
matter
oh
i
forgot
face
he
is
apparently
looking
down
at
his
father
wonderingly
you
got
over
it
yet
father
i
got
over
it
so
long
ago
i
wish
you
people
would
understand
what
a
little
thing
it
is
me
very
humbly
me
dick
right
he
is
in
the
chair
again
i
ca
tell
you
where
i
was
killed
it
against
the
regulations
know
where
curiously
got
a
wire
i
suppose
always
a
wire
for
officers
even
for
lieutenants
jolly
decent
of
them
me
dick
about
the
the
veil
i
mean
the
veil
that
is
drawn
between
the
living
and
the
dead
funny
how
you
jib
at
that
word
suppose
the
veil
is
like
a
mist
veil
a
rummy
thing
father
yes
like
a
mist
but
when
one
has
been
at
the
front
for
a
bit
you
ca
think
how
thin
the
veil
seems
to
get
just
one
layer
of
it
i
suppose
it
seems
thin
to
you
out
there
because
one
step
takes
you
through
it
we
sometimes
mix
up
those
who
have
gone
through
with
those
who
have
i
daresay
if
i
were
to
go
back
to
my
old
battalion
the
living
chaps
would
just
nod
to
me
that
pipe
death
well
to
me
before
my
day
came
it
was
like
some
part
of
the
line
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
but
never
been
in
i
mean
never
been
in
to
stay
because
of
course
one
often
popped
in
and
out
the
day
that
you
day
i
do
remember
being
hit
you
know
i
do
remember
anything
till
the
quietness
came
when
you
have
been
killed
it
suddenly
becomes
very
quiet
quieter
even
than
you
have
ever
known
it
at
home
sunday
used
to
be
a
pretty
quiet
day
at
my
tutor
when
trotter
and
i
flattened
out
on
the
first
shady
spot
up
the
river
but
it
is
quieter
than
that
i
am
not
boring
you
am
i
boy
i
came
to
the
veil
was
so
thin
that
i
could
see
it
at
all
and
my
first
thought
was
which
side
of
it
have
i
come
out
on
the
living
ones
lying
on
the
ground
were
asking
that
about
themselves
too
there
we
were
all
sitting
up
and
asking
whether
we
were
alive
or
dead
and
some
were
one
and
some
were
the
other
sort
of
fluke
you
know
i
oh
dick
soon
as
each
had
found
out
about
himself
he
wondered
how
it
had
gone
with
his
chums
i
halloo
to
johnny
randall
and
he
halloo
back
that
he
was
dead
but
that
trotter
was
living
that
the
way
of
it
a
good
deal
of
chaff
of
course
by
that
time
the
veil
was
there
and
getting
thicker
and
we
lined
up
on
our
right
sides
then
i
could
only
see
the
living
ones
in
shadow
and
hear
their
voices
from
a
distance
they
sang
out
to
us
for
a
while
but
just
at
first
father
it
was
rather
lonely
when
we
could
hear
their
tread
any
longer
what
are
you
fidgeting
about
you
need
worry
that
did
last
long
we
were
heaps
more
interested
in
ourselves
than
in
them
you
should
have
heard
the
gabbling
it
was
all
so
frightfully
novel
you
see
and
no
one
quite
knew
what
to
do
next
whether
all
to
start
off
together
or
wait
for
some
one
to
come
for
us
i
say
what
a
lot
i
talking
happened
dick
a
proud
ring
coming
into
the
voice
came
for
us
he
used
to
be
alive
you
know
the
ockley
who
was
keeper
of
the
fives
in
my
first
half
i
once
pointed
him
out
to
mother
i
was
jolly
glad
he
was
the
one
who
came
for
us
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
was
ockley
i
knew
we
should
be
all
right
i
like
that
ockley
i
wish
i
could
remember
something
funny
to
tell
you
though
there
are
lots
of
jokes
but
i
am
such
a
one
for
forgetting
them
he
laughs
boisterously
we
may
be
sure
that
he
flings
back
his
head
you
remember
how
dick
used
to
fling
back
his
head
when
he
laughed
no
you
did
know
him
do
you
remember
little
wantage
who
was
at
my
private
and
came
on
to
ridley
house
in
my
third
half
his
mother
was
the
one
you
called
emily
wantage
boy
the
card
we
used
to
call
him
jemima
because
he
and
his
mother
were
both
caught
crying
when
struck
and
she
had
to
clear
out
was
very
fond
of
him
dick
i
expect
no
end
tell
her
he
killed
knows
had
got
a
wire
that
is
the
joke
though
you
see
he
got
into
a
hopeless
muddle
about
which
side
of
the
veil
he
had
come
out
on
and
he
went
off
with
the
other
ones
and
they
would
have
him
and
he
got
lost
in
the
veil
running
up
and
down
it
calling
to
us
and
just
for
the
lark
we
did
answer
he
chuckles
expect
he
has
become
a
ghost
with
sudden
consideration
not
tell
his
mother
that
don
rises
wincing
and
dick
also
is
at
once
on
his
feet
full
of
compunction
that
shabby
of
me
sorry
father
we
are
all
pretty
young
you
know
and
we
ca
help
having
our
fun
still
glad
you
still
have
your
fun
the
father
says
once
more
putting
his
hands
on
dick
shoulders
me
look
at
you
again
dick
there
is
such
a
serenity
about
you
now
that
the
word
none
of
us
could
remember
what
the
word
was
it
a
ripping
good
thing
to
have
i
should
be
awfully
bucked
if
you
would
have
it
too
try
say
how
my
tongue
runs
on
but
after
all
it
was
my
show
now
you
tell
me
some
things
about
dick
the
war
almost
in
a
shout
have
a
fine
for
speaking
about
the
war
and
you
know
those
fellows
we
were
fighting
i
forget
who
they
were
germans
yes
some
of
them
were
on
the
same
side
of
the
veil
with
us
and
they
were
rather
decent
so
we
chummed
up
in
the
end
and
ockley
took
us
all
away
together
they
were
jolly
lucky
in
getting
ockley
there
i
go
again
come
on
it
your
turn
has
the
bathroom
tap
been
mended
yet
afraid
it
is
just
tied
up
with
that
string
still
dick
it
works
all
right
only
needs
two
you
know
see
to
it
you
know
whether
any
one
at
my
tutors
got
his
fives
choice
this
half
sorry
dick
but
who
is
the
captain
of
the
boats
i
have
you
been
doing
he
is
moving
about
the
room
here
mother
is
mother
all
right
sad
about
you
dick
i
say
that
is
fair
why
does
she
cheer
up
is
so
easy
my
boy
pretty
hard
lines
on
me
you
know
is
that
you
are
sad
i
have
to
be
sad
that
how
we
have
got
to
work
it
off
you
ca
think
how
we
want
to
be
bright
always
remember
that
and
i
tell
your
mother
ah
but
she
believe
me
dick
you
will
have
to
tell
her
yourself
ca
do
that
father
i
can
only
come
to
one
should
have
been
the
one
she
loved
you
best
dick
i
do
know
do
you
ever
with
a
slight
hesitation
laura
now
is
staying
with
us
at
present
she
i
think
i
should
like
to
see
her
laura
were
to
see
you
she
would
see
me
she
is
not
dressed
in
black
is
she
in
white
girl
i
suppose
mother
is
in
black
dick
too
bad
you
know
were
exactly
engaged
to
laura
were
you
dick
a
bold
question
from
a
father
but
the
circumstances
were
unusual
apologetically
never
rightly
knew
dick
has
flung
back
his
head
again
confidentially
i
sometimes
thought
of
it
but
it
rather
scared
me
i
expect
that
is
about
how
it
was
with
her
too
is
very
broken
about
you
now
irritated
hang
you
like
her
to
forget
you
dick
not
but
she
might
help
a
fellow
a
bit
hullo
what
calls
forth
this
exclamation
is
the
little
table
at
which
the
seance
had
taken
place
the
four
chairs
are
still
standing
round
it
as
if
they
were
guarding
something
something
new
father
this
table
it
is
usually
in
the
course
i
remember
don
sets
his
teeth
that
table
suggest
anything
to
you
dick
me
let
me
think
yes
i
used
to
play
backgammon
on
it
what
is
it
doing
here
mother
brought
it
in
play
games
on
mother
do
know
that
it
was
a
game
dick
to
play
anything
i
precious
glad
she
can
do
that
was
laura
playing
with
her
was
helping
her
for
laura
he
is
looking
at
some
slips
of
paper
on
the
table
those
pieces
of
paper
used
in
the
game
there
is
writing
on
them
the
first
letter
is
h
the
second
letter
is
a
the
third
letter
is
what
does
it
mean
it
convey
no
meaning
to
you
dick
me
no
why
should
it
don
is
enjoying
no
triumph
us
go
back
to
the
fire
my
boy
dick
follows
him
into
the
why
should
it
convey
a
meaning
to
me
i
was
never
much
of
a
hand
at
indoor
games
brightly
bet
you
ockley
would
be
good
at
it
after
a
joyous
ramble
nickname
still
sticks
to
him
do
think
i
know
it
was
a
frightful
swell
you
know
keeper
of
the
field
and
played
against
harrow
the
same
year
i
suppose
it
did
go
just
a
little
to
his
head
they
are
back
in
their
old
seats
and
don
leans
forward
in
gleeful
anticipation
probably
dick
is
leaning
forward
in
the
same
way
and
this
old
father
is
merely
copying
him
did
you
nickname
him
dick
was
his
fags
that
did
it
should
like
to
know
it
i
say
do
tell
me
dick
is
pretty
touchy
about
it
now
you
know
wo
tell
any
one
come
on
dick
fags
called
him
meaning
dick
kindly
call
me
god
don
flings
back
his
head
so
we
know
what
dick
is
doing
they
are
a
hilarious
pair
perhaps
too
noisy
for
suddenly
don
looks
at
the
door
think
i
heard
some
one
dick
it
mother
may
nervously
heard
the
row
dick
eyes
must
be
twinkling
say
father
you
catch
it
ca
believe
dick
gazing
wistfully
into
the
chair
she
wo
see
you
it
is
a
sadder
voice
than
his
own
for
the
moment
that
answers
one
may
see
me
will
speak
to
her
dick
let
her
hear
your
voice
one
may
hear
me
i
could
make
her
the
one
but
it
would
mean
your
losing
me
ca
give
you
up
dick
don
comes
in
as
beautiful
as
ever
but
a
little
aggrieved
called
to
you
robert
i
thought
i
was
just
going
to
he
has
come
from
the
to
meet
her
he
looks
from
her
to
dick
whom
he
sees
so
clearly
standing
now
by
the
fire
an
awe
falls
upon
don
he
says
her
name
meaning
grace
who
is
with
us
her
eyes
follow
his
but
she
sees
nothing
not
even
two
arms
outstretched
to
her
is
it
robert
what
is
the
matter
she
does
not
hear
a
voice
say
heard
you
laughing
robert
what
on
earth
at
the
father
can
not
speak
you
in
a
hole
father
says
a
mischievous
voice
i
not
be
told
robert
in
the
paper
the
voice
whispers
don
lifts
the
paper
feebly
and
his
wife
understands
a
newspaper
joke
please
i
do
want
to
hear
it
it
my
laughing
that
brought
you
back
grace
that
would
only
have
made
me
shut
my
door
if
dick
thought
you
could
laugh
she
goes
to
the
little
table
came
back
for
these
slips
of
paper
she
lifts
them
and
presses
them
to
her
breast
precious
slips
of
paper
dick
was
always
a
curious
boy
and
forgetting
that
she
can
not
hear
him
he
blurts
out
do
you
mean
mother
why
are
they
precious
don
forgets
also
and
looks
to
her
for
an
answer
is
it
robert
you
hear
anything
grace
perhaps
laura
was
calling
i
left
her
on
the
stair
wish
don
is
fighting
for
dick
now
wish
laura
would
come
back
and
say
to
me
daresay
she
will
valiantly
she
could
be
rather
brighter
grace
think
dick
would
like
it
her
fine
eyes
reproach
him
mutely
but
she
says
ever
forgiving
that
how
you
look
at
it
robert
very
well
laugh
your
fill
if
you
can
but
if
dick
were
to
appear
before
me
in
his
distress
don
cries
aloud
to
the
figure
by
the
fire
if
you
can
appear
to
your
mother
do
it
there
is
a
pause
in
which
anything
may
happen
but
nothing
happens
yes
something
happened
dick
has
stuck
to
his
father
robert
don
says
and
without
a
word
of
reproach
she
goes
away
evidently
dick
comes
to
his
father
who
has
sank
into
a
chair
and
puts
a
loving
hand
on
him
don
clasps
it
without
looking
up
that
was
of
you
poor
mother
i
should
have
liked
to
hug
her
but
i
ca
should
have
gone
to
her
dick
you
should
have
minded
me
the
wiser
boy
says
a
darling
but
she
does
need
me
as
much
as
you
do
do
know
all
right
i
glad
she
so
keen
about
that
game
though
he
has
returned
to
the
when
laura
comes
in
eager
to
make
amends
to
dick
father
if
she
hurt
him
when
she
went
out
softly
have
come
to
say
mr
don
nice
of
you
laura
taking
both
her
hands
dick
speaks
want
her
to
come
nearer
to
the
fire
i
ca
see
her
very
well
there
for
a
moment
don
is
caught
out
again
but
laura
has
heard
nothing
he
becomes
quite
cunning
in
dick
interests
hands
are
cold
laura
go
over
to
the
fire
i
want
to
look
at
you
she
sits
on
the
hearthstone
by
dick
feet
shyly
i
all
right
it
is
dick
who
answers
awfully
pretty
laura
you
are
even
prettier
than
i
thought
i
remember
i
used
to
think
she
ca
be
quite
as
pretty
as
i
think
her
and
then
when
you
came
you
were
just
a
little
prettier
she
has
been
warming
her
hands
do
you
say
anything
she
asks
don
was
thinking
of
you
and
dick
laura
a
pretty
soul
she
has
father
says
the
boy
can
see
right
down
into
it
now
dick
had
lived
laura
do
you
think
that
you
and
he
with
shining
eyes
think
if
he
had
wanted
it
very
much
expect
he
would
my
dear
there
is
an
odd
candour
about
dick
contribution
think
so
too
but
i
never
was
quite
sure
they
are
a
very
young
pair
laura
is
trembling
a
little
don
laura
think
there
is
something
wicked
about
me
i
sometimes
feel
quite
though
dick
has
gone
nowadays
the
fruit
trees
have
that
sort
of
shame
when
they
blossom
laura
but
they
ca
help
doing
it
i
hope
you
are
yet
to
be
a
happy
woman
a
happy
wife
seems
so
heartless
to
dick
a
bit
it
what
i
should
like
dick
says
what
he
would
like
laura
you
remember
laura
dick
goes
on
kissed
you
once
it
was
under
a
lilac
in
the
loudon
woods
i
knew
at
the
time
that
you
were
angry
and
i
should
have
apologised
i
sorry
laura
his
sweetheart
has
risen
tasting
something
is
it
laura
don
asks
i
do
know
how
but
for
a
moment
i
seemed
to
feel
the
smell
of
lilac
dick
was
once
nice
to
me
under
a
lilac
oh
don
she
goes
to
him
like
a
child
and
he
soothes
and
pets
her
there
that
will
be
all
right
quite
all
right
he
takes
her
to
the
door
my
dear
mr
don
laura
says
the
third
voice
don
is
looking
so
glum
that
the
moment
they
are
alone
dick
has
to
cry
warningly
he
is
probably
looking
glum
himself
for
he
says
candidly
awful
things
these
partings
father
do
feel
hurt
though
i
dodge
the
business
when
i
leave
you
so
like
you
dick
have
to
go
soon
dick
ca
you
something
i
want
not
to
miss
you
see
glad
of
that
not
going
yet
but
i
mean
that
when
i
do
i
just
slip
away
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
you
wo
come
back
will
honest
injun
if
you
keep
bright
if
i
do
that
dick
you
might
think
i
was
missing
you
so
much
know
better
than
that
you
see
if
you
bright
i
get
a
good
mark
for
it
be
bright
dick
pops
him
into
the
settle
again
your
pipe
dick

still
go
to
that
and
do
your
exercises

must
right

will
i
want
you
to
be
smarter
next
time

dick
i
bring
it
out
again
don
hesitates
there
is
something
i
have
wanted
to
ask
you
all
the
time
some
fear
seems
to
come
into
the
boy
voice

it
father
shall
go
on
worrying
about
it
if
i
do
but
just
as
you
like
dick
ahead
father
ask
me
is
this
would
you
rather
be
here
than
there
after
a
pause
the
boy
says
always
is
the
great
difference
dick
down
here
one
knows
he
has
risks
to
run
you
miss
that
must
be
rather
jolly
you
know
that
was
what
i
was
to
ask
but
remember
i
young
at
it
your
gaiety
dick
is
it
all
real
or
only
put
on
to
help
me
it
half
and
half
father
he
cries
next
moment
then
cajolingly
will
you
come
again
dick
no
saying
one
ca
always
get
through
they
keep
changing
the
password
his
voice
grows
troubled
awfully
difficult
to
get
the
password
was
it
bade
me
welcome
don
rises
he
stares
at
his
son
did
you
get
it
dick
not
sure
dick
seems
to
go
closer
to
his
father
as
if
for
protection
are
lots
of
things
i
do
understand
yet
are
things
i
do
understand
either

to
send
messages
from

no
get
messages
from
us
how
could
we
there
anything
in
it
don
is
not
speaking
to
his
son
he
goes
to
the
little
table
and
looks
long
at
it
has
it
taken
on
a
sinister
aspect
those
chairs
are
they
guarding
a
secret
this
table
your
mother
how
could
they
he
turns
to
find
that
dick
has
gone
my
boy
dick
the
voice
leaves
a
message
behind
it
bright
father
don
sits
down
by
the
fire
to
think
it
all
out
