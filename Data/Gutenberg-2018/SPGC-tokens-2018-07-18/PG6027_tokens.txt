been
before
frontispiece
she
often
sat
curving
her
small
long
fingers
backward
they
gazed
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
ages
of
years
come
and
play
with
me
she
must
go
and
stand
at
the
door
and
press
her
cheek
against
the
wood
and
wait
and
listen
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
upper
floors
the
ledge
of
the
window
was
so
low
that
a
mere
step
took
her
outside
i
going
up
to
play
with
the
little
girl
mother
you
do
mind
do
you
part
one
in
the
fierce
airless
heat
of
the
small
square
room
the
child
judith
panted
as
she
lay
on
her
bed
her
father
and
mother
slept
near
her
drowned
in
the
heavy
slumber
of
workers
after
their
day
labour
some
people
in
the
next
flat
were
quarrelling
irritated
probably
by
the
appalling
heat
and
their
miserable
helplessness
against
it
all
the
hot
emanations
of
the
city
streets
seemed
to
combine
with
their
clamour
and
unrest
and
rise
to
the
flat
in
which
the
child
lay
gazing
at
the
darkness
it
was
situated
but
a
few
feet
from
the
track
of
the
elevated
railroad
and
existence
seemed
to
pulsate
to
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
demon
which
swept
past
the
windows
every
few
minutes
no
one
knew
that
judith
held
the
thing
in
horror
but
it
was
a
truth
that
she
did
she
was
only
seven
years
old
and
at
that
age
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
one
self
so
that
older
people
can
understand
she
could
only
have
said
i
hate
it
it
comes
so
fast
it
is
always
coming
it
makes
a
sound
as
if
thunder
was
quite
close
i
can
never
get
away
from
it
the
children
in
the
other
flats
rather
liked
it
they
hung
out
of
the
window
perilously
to
watch
it
thunder
past
and
to
see
the
people
who
crowded
it
pressed
close
together
in
the
seats
standing
in
the
aisles
hanging
on
to
the
straps
sometimes
in
the
evening
there
were
people
in
it
who
were
going
to
the
theatre
and
the
women
and
girls
were
dressed
in
light
colours
and
wore
hats
covered
with
white
feathers
and
flowers
at
such
times
the
children
were
delighted
and
judith
used
to
hear
the
three
in
the
next
flat
calling
out
to
each
other
that
my
lady
that
my
lady
that
one
mine
judith
was
not
like
the
children
in
the
other
flats
she
was
a
frail
curious
creature
with
silent
ways
and
a
soft
voice
and
eyes
she
liked
to
play
by
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
to
talk
to
herself
as
she
played
no
one
knew
what
she
talked
about
and
in
fact
no
one
inquired
her
mother
was
always
too
busy
when
she
was
not
making
men
coats
by
the
score
at
the
whizzing
sewing
machine
she
was
hurriedly
preparing
a
meal
which
was
always
in
danger
of
being
late
there
was
the
breakfast
which
might
not
be
ready
in
time
for
her
husband
to
reach
his
shop
when
the
whistle
blew
there
was
the
supper
which
might
not
be
in
time
to
be
in
waiting
for
him
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
the
midday
meal
was
a
trifling
matter
needing
no
special
preparation
one
ate
anything
one
could
find
left
from
supper
or
breakfast
judith
relation
to
her
father
and
mother
was
not
a
very
intimate
one
they
were
too
hard
worked
to
have
time
for
domestic
intimacies
and
a
feature
of
their
acquaintance
was
that
though
neither
of
them
was
sufficiently
articulate
to
have
found
expression
for
the
fact
the
young
man
and
woman
felt
the
child
vaguely
remote
their
affection
for
her
was
tinged
with
something
indefinitely
like
reverence
she
had
been
a
lovely
baby
with
a
peculiar
magnolia
whiteness
of
skin
and
very
large
sweetly
smiling
eyes
of
dark
blue
fringed
with
quite
black
lashes
she
had
exquisite
pointed
fingers
and
slender
feet
and
though
and
foster
were
perhaps
fortunately
unaware
of
it
she
had
been
not
at
all
the
baby
one
would
have
expected
to
come
to
life
in
a
corner
of
the
hive
of
a
workman
flat
a
few
feet
from
the
elevated
railroad
seems
sometimes
as
if
somehow
she
could
be
mine
foster
said
at
times
she
ai
like
me
an
she
ai
like
jem
foster
lord
knows
she
ai
like
none
of
either
of
our
families
ever
heard
of
it
might
be
her
aunt
hester
but
she
died
long
before
i
was
born
i
only
heard
mother
tell
about
her
she
was
a
awful
pretty
girl
mother
said
she
had
that
kind
of
complexion
and
long
slender
fingers
that
was
so
supple
she
could
curl
back
like
they
was
her
eyes
was
big
and
had
eyelashes
that
stood
out
round
but
they
was
brown
mother
said
she
was
like
any
other
kind
of
girl
and
she
thinks
judith
may
turn
out
like
her
she
was
but
fifteen
when
she
died
she
never
was
ill
in
her
life
but
one
morning
she
did
come
down
to
breakfast
and
when
they
went
up
to
call
her
there
she
was
sittin
at
her
window
restin
her
chin
on
her
hand
with
her
face
turned
up
smilin
as
if
she
was
talkin
to
some
one
the
doctor
said
it
had
happened
hours
before
when
she
had
come
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
stars
easy
way
to
go
it
judith
had
heard
of
her
aunt
hester
but
she
only
knew
that
she
herself
had
hands
like
her
and
that
her
life
had
ended
when
she
was
quite
young
foster
was
too
much
occupied
by
the
strenuousness
of
life
to
dwell
upon
the
passing
of
souls
to
her
the
girl
hester
seemed
too
remote
to
appear
quite
real
the
legends
of
her
beauty
and
unlikeness
to
other
girls
seemed
rather
like
a
sort
of
romance
as
she
was
not
aware
that
judith
hated
the
elevated
railroad
so
she
was
not
aware
that
she
was
fond
of
the
far
away
aunt
hester
with
the
fingers
which
could
curl
backwards
she
did
not
know
that
when
she
was
playing
in
her
corner
of
the
room
where
it
was
her
way
to
sit
on
her
little
chair
with
her
face
turned
towards
the
wall
she
often
sat
curving
her
small
long
fingers
backward
and
talking
to
herself
about
aunt
hester
but
this
as
well
as
many
other
things
was
true
it
was
not
secretiveness
which
caused
the
child
to
refrain
from
speaking
of
certain
things
she
herself
could
not
have
explained
the
reasons
for
her
silence
also
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
explanation
and
reasons
were
necessary
her
mental
attitude
was
that
of
a
child
who
knowing
a
certain
language
does
not
speak
it
to
those
who
have
never
heard
and
are
wholly
ignorant
of
it
she
knew
her
aunt
hester
as
her
mother
did
not
she
had
seen
her
often
in
her
dreams
and
had
a
secret
fancy
that
she
could
dream
of
her
when
she
wished
to
do
so
she
was
very
fond
of
dreaming
of
her
the
places
where
she
came
upon
aunt
hester
were
strange
and
lovely
places
where
the
air
one
breathed
smelled
like
flowers
and
everything
was
lovely
in
a
new
way
and
when
one
moved
one
felt
so
light
that
movement
was
delightful
and
when
one
wakened
one
had
not
quite
got
over
the
lightness
and
for
a
few
moments
felt
as
if
one
would
float
out
of
bed
the
healthy
vigourous
young
couple
who
were
the
child
parents
were
in
a
healthy
earthly
way
very
fond
of
each
other
they
had
made
a
genuine
love
match
and
had
found
it
satisfactory
the
young
mechanic
jem
foster
had
met
the
young
jane
hardy
at
coney
island
one
summer
night
and
had
become
at
once
enamoured
of
her
good
looks
and
high
spirits
they
had
married
as
soon
as
jem
had
had
the
raise
he
was
anticipating
and
had
from
that
time
lived
with
much
harmony
in
the
flat
building
by
which
the
elevated
train
rushed
and
roared
every
few
minutes
through
the
day
and
a
greater
part
of
the
night
they
themselves
did
not
object
to
the
elevated
jem
was
habituated
to
uproar
in
the
machine
shop
in
which
he
spent
his
days
and
jane
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
making
of
men
coats
by
the
dozens
to
observe
anything
else
the
pair
had
healthy
appetites
and
slept
well
after
their
day
work
hearty
supper
long
cheerful
talk
and
loud
laughter
over
simple
common
joking
she
a
queer
little
fish
judy
jane
said
to
her
husband
as
they
sat
by
the
open
window
one
night
jem
arm
curved
comfortably
around
the
young
woman
waist
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
what
do
you
think
she
says
to
me
after
i
put
her
to
bed
search
me
said
jem
oracularly
jane
laughed
she
says
wish
the
elevated
train
would
stop
says
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
says
she
going
to
dream
of
aunt
hester
what
does
she
know
about
her
aunt
hester
said
jem
who
been
talkin
to
her
not
me
jane
said
she
do
know
nothing
but
what
picked
up
by
chance
i
do
believe
in
talkin
to
young
ones
about
dead
folks
healthy
that
right
said
jem
children
that
got
to
hustle
about
among
live
folks
for
a
livin
best
keep
their
minds
out
of
cemeteries
but
hully
gee
what
a
queer
thing
for
a
young
one
to
say
and
that
ai
all
jane
went
on
her
giggle
half
amused
half
nervous
i
do
fall
asleep
when
i
see
aunt
hester
says
she
fall
awake
it
more
awake
there
than
here
says
i
laughing
a
bit
though
it
did
make
me
feel
queer
do
know
she
says
in
that
soft
little
quiet
way
of
hers
and
not
another
thing
could
i
get
out
of
her
on
the
hot
night
through
whose
first
hours
judith
lay
panting
in
her
corner
of
the
room
tormented
and
kept
awake
by
the
constant
roar
and
rush
and
flash
of
lights
she
was
trying
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
hope
of
leaving
all
the
heat
and
noise
and
discomfort
behind
and
reaching
aunt
hester
if
she
could
fall
awake
she
would
feel
and
hear
none
of
it
it
would
all
be
unreal
and
she
would
know
that
only
the
lightness
and
the
air
like
flowers
and
the
lovely
brightness
were
true
once
as
she
tossed
on
her
she
broke
into
a
low
little
laugh
to
think
how
untrue
things
really
were
and
how
strange
it
was
that
people
did
not
understand
that
even
she
felt
as
she
lay
in
the
darkness
that
she
could
not
get
away
and
she
could
not
get
away
unless
the
train
would
stop
just
long
enough
to
let
her
fall
asleep
if
she
could
fall
asleep
between
the
trains
she
would
not
awaken
but
they
came
so
quickly
one
after
the
other
her
hair
was
damp
as
she
pushed
it
from
her
forehead
the
bed
felt
hot
against
her
skin
the
people
in
the
next
flat
quarreled
more
angrily
judith
heard
a
loud
slap
and
then
the
woman
began
to
cry
she
was
a
young
married
woman
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
her
marriage
had
not
been
as
successful
as
that
of
judith
parents
both
husband
and
wife
had
irritable
tempers
through
the
thin
wall
judith
could
hear
the
girl
sobbing
angrily
as
the
man
flung
himself
out
of
bed
put
on
his
clothes
and
went
out
banging
the
door
after
him
she
does
know
the
child
whispered
eerily
that
it
real
at
all
there
was
in
her
strange
little
soul
a
secret
no
one
knew
the
existence
of
it
was
a
vague
belief
that
she
herself
was
not
quite
real
or
that
she
did
not
belong
to
the
life
she
had
been
born
into
her
mother
and
father
loved
her
and
she
loved
them
but
sometimes
she
was
on
the
brink
of
telling
them
that
she
could
not
stay
long
that
some
mistake
had
been
made
what
mistake
or
where
was
she
to
go
to
if
she
went
she
did
not
know
she
used
to
catch
her
breath
and
stop
herself
and
feel
frightened
when
she
had
been
near
speaking
of
this
fantastic
thing
but
the
building
full
of
workmen
flats
the
hot
room
the
elevated
railroad
the
quarrelling
people
were
all
a
mistake
just
once
or
twice
in
her
life
she
had
seen
places
and
things
which
did
not
seem
so
foreign
once
when
she
had
been
taken
to
the
park
in
the
spring
she
had
wandered
away
from
her
mother
to
a
sequestered
place
among
shrubs
and
trees
all
waving
tender
new
pale
green
with
the
leaves
a
few
early
hot
days
had
caused
to
rush
out
and
tremble
unfurled
there
had
been
a
stillness
there
and
scents
and
colours
she
knew
a
bird
had
come
and
swung
upon
a
twig
quite
near
her
and
looking
at
her
with
bright
soft
full
eyes
had
sung
gently
to
her
as
if
he
were
speaking
a
squirrel
had
crept
up
onto
her
lap
and
had
not
moved
when
she
stroked
it
its
eyes
had
been
full
and
soft
also
and
she
knew
it
understood
that
she
could
not
hurt
it
there
was
no
mistake
in
her
being
among
the
new
fair
greenness
and
the
woodland
things
who
spoke
to
her
they
did
not
use
words
but
no
words
were
needed
she
knew
what
they
were
saying
when
she
had
pushed
her
way
through
the
greenness
of
the
shrubbery
to
the
driveway
she
had
found
herself
quite
near
to
an
open
carriage
which
had
stopped
because
the
lady
who
sat
in
it
was
speaking
to
a
friend
on
the
path
she
was
a
young
woman
dressed
in
delicate
spring
colours
and
the
little
girl
at
her
side
was
dressed
in
white
cloth
and
it
was
at
the
little
girl
judith
found
herself
gazing
under
her
large
white
hat
and
feathers
her
little
face
seemed
like
a
white
flower
she
had
a
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
her
hair
was
a
rich
coppery
red
and
hung
heavy
and
long
about
her
cheeks
and
shoulders
she
lifted
her
head
a
little
when
the
child
in
the
common
hat
and
frock
pressed
through
the
greenness
of
the
bushes
and
she
looked
at
judith
just
as
the
bird
and
the
squirrel
had
looked
at
her
they
gazed
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
ages
of
years
and
were
separated
by
nothing
each
of
them
was
quite
happy
at
being
near
the
other
and
there
was
not
in
the
mind
of
either
any
question
of
their
not
being
near
each
other
again
the
question
did
not
rise
in
judith
mind
even
when
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
carriage
moved
away
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
of
equipages
rolling
by
at
the
hottest
hours
of
the
hot
night
judith
recalled
to
herself
the
cool
of
that
day
she
brought
back
the
fresh
pale
greenness
of
the
nook
among
the
bushes
into
which
she
had
forced
her
way
the
scent
of
the
leaves
and
grass
which
she
had
drawn
in
as
she
breathed
the
nearness
in
the
eyes
of
the
bird
the
squirrel
and
the
child
she
smiled
as
she
thought
of
these
things
and
as
she
continued
to
remember
yet
other
things
bit
by
bit
she
felt
less
hot
she
gradually
forgot
to
listen
for
the
roar
of
the
train
she
smiled
still
more
she
lay
quite
still
she
was
cool
a
tiny
fresh
breeze
fluttered
through
the
window
and
played
about
her
forehead
she
was
smiling
in
soft
delight
as
her
eyelids
drooped
and
closed
i
am
falling
awake
she
was
murmuring
as
her
lashes
touched
her
cheek
perhaps
when
her
eyes
closed
the
sultriness
of
the
night
had
changed
to
the
momentary
freshness
of
the
turning
dawn
and
the
next
hour
or
so
was
really
cooler
she
knew
no
more
heat
but
slept
softly
deeply
long
or
it
seemed
to
her
afterwards
that
she
had
slept
long
as
if
she
had
drifted
far
away
in
dreamless
peace
she
remembered
no
dream
saw
nothing
felt
nothing
until
as
it
seemed
to
her
in
the
early
morning
she
opened
her
eyes
all
was
quite
still
and
clear
the
air
of
the
room
was
pure
and
sweet
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
and
curiously
enough
she
was
not
surprised
by
this
nor
did
she
expect
to
hear
anything
disturbing
she
did
not
look
round
the
room
her
eyes
remained
resting
upon
what
she
first
saw
and
she
was
not
surprised
by
this
either
a
little
girl
about
her
own
age
was
standing
smiling
at
her
she
had
large
eyes
a
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
and
coppery
red
hair
which
fell
about
her
cheeks
and
shoulders
judith
knew
her
and
smiled
back
at
her
she
lifted
her
hand
and
it
was
a
pure
white
little
hand
with
long
tapering
fingers
come
and
play
with
me
she
said
though
judith
heard
no
voice
while
she
knew
what
she
was
saying
come
and
play
with
me
then
she
was
gone
and
in
a
few
seconds
judith
was
awake
the
air
of
the
room
had
changed
the
noise
and
clatter
of
the
streets
came
in
at
the
window
and
the
elevated
train
went
thundering
by
judith
did
not
ask
herself
how
the
child
had
gone
or
how
she
had
come
she
lay
still
feeling
undisturbed
by
everything
and
smiling
as
she
had
smiled
in
her
sleep
while
she
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
she
saw
her
mother
looking
at
her
curiously
you
look
as
if
you
slept
cool
instead
of
hot
last
night
she
said
you
look
better
than
you
did
yesterday
you
pretty
well
ai
you
judy
judith
smile
meant
that
she
was
quite
well
but
she
said
nothing
about
her
sleeping
the
heat
did
not
disturb
her
through
the
day
though
the
hours
grew
hotter
and
hotter
as
they
passed
jane
foster
sweltering
at
her
machine
was
obliged
to
stop
every
few
minutes
to
wipe
the
beads
from
her
face
and
neck
sometimes
she
could
not
remain
seated
but
got
up
panting
to
drink
water
and
fan
herself
with
a
newspaper
i
ca
stand
much
more
of
this
she
kept
saying
if
there
do
come
a
thunderstorm
to
cool
things
off
i
do
know
what
i
do
this
room
about
five
hundred
but
the
heat
grew
greater
and
the
elevated
trains
went
thundering
by
when
jem
came
home
from
his
work
his
supper
was
not
ready
jane
was
sitting
helplessly
by
the
window
almost
livid
in
her
pallor
the
table
was
but
half
spread
hullo
said
jem
it
done
you
up
ai
it
well
i
guess
it
has
certain
of
his
sympathy
but
i
get
over
it
presently
and
then
i
can
get
you
a
cold
bite
i
ca
stand
over
the
stove
and
cook
hully
gee
a
cold
bite
all
a
man
wants
on
a
night
like
this
hot
chops
give
him
the
but
i
got
good
news
for
you
it
cheered
me
up
myself
jane
lifted
her
head
from
the
chair
back
what
is
it
well
it
came
through
my
boss
he
always
been
friendly
to
me
he
asks
a
question
or
so
every
now
and
then
and
seems
to
take
an
interest
he
was
asking
me
if
it
was
pretty
hot
and
noisy
down
here
and
after
i
told
him
how
we
stood
it
he
said
he
believed
he
could
get
us
a
better
place
to
stay
in
through
the
summer
some
one
he
knows
has
had
illness
and
trouble
in
his
family
and
he
obliged
to
close
his
house
and
take
his
wife
away
into
the
mountains
they
got
a
beautiful
big
house
in
one
of
them
far
up
streets
by
the
park
and
he
wants
to
get
caretakers
in
that
can
come
well
recommended
the
boss
said
he
could
recommend
us
fast
enough
and
there
a
big
light
basement
that
be
as
cool
as
the
woods
and
we
can
move
in
and
all
got
to
do
is
to
see
that
things
are
safe
and
live
happy
oh
jem
jane
ejaculated
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
up
by
the
park
a
big
cool
place
to
live
we
none
of
us
ever
been
in
a
house
the
size
of
it
you
know
what
they
look
like
outside
and
they
say
they
bigger
than
they
look
it
your
business
to
go
over
the
rooms
every
day
or
so
to
see
nothing
going
wrong
in
them
moths
or
dirt
i
suppose
it
all
left
open
but
just
one
room
they
left
locked
and
do
want
interfered
with
i
told
the
boss
i
thought
the
basement
would
seem
like
the
to
us
i
tell
you
i
was
so
glad
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
jane
drew
a
long
breath
a
big
house
up
there
she
said
and
only
one
closed
room
in
it
it
too
good
to
be
true
well
whether
it
true
or
not
we
move
out
there
jem
answered
cheerfully
morning
bright
and
early
the
boss
said
the
sooner
the
better
a
large
house
left
deserted
by
those
who
have
filled
its
rooms
with
emotions
and
life
expresses
a
silence
a
quality
all
its
own
a
house
unfurnished
and
empty
seems
less
impressively
silent
the
fact
of
its
devoidness
of
sound
is
upon
the
whole
more
natural
but
carpets
accustomed
to
the
pressure
of
constantly
passing
feet
chairs
and
sofas
which
have
held
human
warmth
draperies
used
to
the
touch
of
hands
drawing
them
aside
to
let
in
daylight
pictures
which
have
smiled
back
at
thinking
eyes
mirrors
which
have
reflected
faces
passing
hourly
in
changing
moods
elate
or
dark
or
longing
walls
which
have
echoed
back
voices
all
these
things
when
left
alone
seem
to
be
held
in
strange
arrest
as
if
by
some
spell
intensifying
the
effect
of
the
pause
in
their
existence
the
child
judith
felt
this
deeply
throughout
the
entirety
of
her
young
being
how
still
it
is
she
said
to
her
mother
the
first
time
they
went
over
the
place
together
well
it
seems
still
up
here
and
kind
of
dead
jane
foster
replied
with
her
habitual
sociable
but
seems
to
me
it
always
feels
that
way
in
a
house
people
left
it
cheerful
enough
down
in
that
big
basement
with
all
the
windows
open
we
can
sit
in
that
room
they
had
fixed
to
play
billiards
in
we
sha
hurt
nothing
we
can
keep
the
table
and
things
covered
up
tell
you
judy
this
be
different
from
last
summer
the
park
ai
but
a
few
steps
away
an
we
can
go
and
sit
there
too
when
we
feel
like
it
talk
about
the
country
i
do
want
no
more
country
than
this
is
you
be
made
over
the
months
we
stay
here
judith
felt
as
if
this
must
veritably
be
a
truth
the
houses
on
either
side
of
the
street
were
closed
for
the
summer
their
occupants
had
gone
to
the
seaside
or
the
mountains
and
the
windows
and
doors
were
boarded
up
the
street
was
a
quiet
one
at
any
time
and
wore
now
the
aspect
of
a
street
in
a
city
of
the
dead
the
green
trees
of
the
park
were
to
be
seen
either
gently
stirring
or
motionless
in
the
sun
at
the
side
of
the
avenue
crossing
the
end
of
it
the
only
token
of
the
existence
of
the
elevated
railroad
was
a
remote
occasional
hum
suggestive
of
the
flying
past
of
a
giant
bee
the
thing
seemed
no
longer
a
roaring
demon
and
judith
scarcely
recognized
that
it
was
still
the
centre
of
the
city
rushing
heated
life
the
owners
of
the
house
had
evidently
deserted
it
suddenly
the
windows
had
not
been
boarded
up
and
the
rooms
had
been
left
in
their
ordinary
condition
the
furniture
was
not
covered
or
the
hangings
swathed
jem
foster
had
been
told
that
his
wife
must
put
things
in
order
the
house
was
beautiful
and
spacious
its
decorations
and
appointments
were
not
mere
testimonies
to
freedom
of
expenditure
but
expressions
of
a
dignified
and
cultivated
thought
judith
followed
her
mother
from
room
to
room
in
one
of
her
singular
moods
the
loftiness
of
the
walls
the
breadth
and
space
about
her
made
her
at
intervals
draw
in
her
breath
with
pleasure
the
pictures
the
colours
the
rich
and
beautiful
textures
she
saw
brought
to
her
the
free
and
at
the
same
time
soothed
feeling
she
remembered
as
the
chief
feature
of
the
dreams
in
which
she
fell
awake
but
beyond
all
other
things
she
rejoiced
in
the
height
and
space
the
sweep
of
view
through
one
large
room
into
another
she
continually
paused
and
stood
with
her
face
lifted
looking
up
at
the
pictured
things
floating
on
a
ceiling
above
her
once
when
she
had
stood
doing
this
long
enough
to
forget
herself
she
was
startled
by
her
mother
laugh
which
broke
in
upon
the
silence
about
them
with
a
curiously
earthly
sound
which
was
almost
a
shock
wake
up
judy
have
you
gone
off
in
a
dream
you
look
all
the
time
as
if
you
was
walking
in
your
sleep
it
so
high
said
judy
those
clouds
make
it
look
like
the
sky
i
got
to
set
these
chairs
straight
said
jane
looks
like
they
been
havin
a
concert
here
all
these
chairs
together
that
part
of
the
room
clear
she
began
to
move
the
chairs
and
rearrange
them
bustling
about
cheerfully
and
talking
the
while
presently
she
stooped
to
pick
something
up
what
this
she
said
and
then
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
mercy
they
felt
so
kind
of
clammy
they
made
me
jump
they
have
had
a
party
here
some
of
the
flowers
left
fallen
on
the
carpet
she
held
up
a
cluster
of
hyacinths
and
large
heavy
rosebuds
faded
to
discoloration
this
has
dropped
out
of
some
set
piece
it
felt
like
cold
flesh
when
i
first
touched
it
i
do
like
a
lot
of
white
things
together
they
look
too
kind
of
mournful
just
go
and
get
the
wastepaper
basket
in
the
library
judy
we
carry
it
around
to
drop
things
into
take
that
with
you
judith
carried
the
flowers
into
the
library
and
bent
to
pick
up
the
basket
as
she
dropped
them
into
it
as
she
raised
her
head
she
found
her
eyes
looking
directly
into
other
eyes
which
gazed
at
her
from
the
wall
they
were
smiling
from
the
face
of
a
child
in
a
picture
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
judith
drew
in
her
breath
and
stood
still
smiling
too
in
response
the
picture
was
that
of
a
little
girl
in
a
floating
white
frock
she
had
a
deep
dimple
at
one
corner
of
her
mouth
her
hanging
hair
was
like
burnished
copper
she
held
up
a
slender
hand
with
pointed
fingers
and
judith
knew
her
oh
she
knew
her
quite
well
she
had
never
felt
so
near
any
one
else
throughout
her
life
judy
judy
jane
foster
called
out
come
here
with
your
basket
what
you
staying
for
judith
returned
to
her
we
got
to
get
a
move
on
said
jane
or
we
sha
get
nothin
done
before
supper
time
what
was
you
lookin
at
there
a
picture
in
there
of
a
little
girl
i
know
judith
said
i
do
know
her
name
but
i
saw
her
in
the
park
once
and
and
i
dreamed
about
her
dreamed
about
her
if
that
ai
queer
well
we
got
to
hurry
up
here
some
more
of
them
dropped
flowers
give
me
the
basket
they
went
through
the
whole
house
together
from
room
to
room
up
the
many
stairs
from
floor
to
floor
and
everywhere
judith
felt
the
curious
stillness
and
silence
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
jane
foster
felt
it
also
it
is
the
stillest
house
i
was
ever
in
she
said
i
glad
i
got
you
with
me
judy
if
i
was
sole
alone
i
believe
it
give
me
the
creeps
these
big
places
ought
to
have
big
families
in
them
it
was
on
the
fourth
floor
that
they
came
upon
the
closed
room
jane
had
found
some
of
the
doors
shut
and
some
open
but
a
turn
of
the
handle
gave
entrance
through
all
the
unopened
ones
until
they
reached
this
one
at
the
back
on
the
fourth
floor
this
one
wo
open
jane
said
when
she
tried
the
handle
then
she
shook
it
once
or
twice
no
it
locked
she
decided
after
an
effort
or
two
there
i
just
remembered
there
one
kept
locked
folks
always
has
things
they
want
locked
up
i
make
sure
though
she
shook
it
turned
the
handle
shook
again
pressed
her
knee
against
the
panel
the
lock
resisted
all
effort
yes
this
is
the
closed
one
she
made
up
her
mind
it
locked
hard
and
fast
it
the
closed
one
it
was
logically
proved
to
be
the
closed
one
by
the
fact
that
she
found
no
other
one
locked
as
she
finished
her
round
of
the
chambers
judith
was
a
little
tired
before
they
had
done
their
work
but
her
wandering
pilgrimage
through
the
large
silent
deserted
house
had
been
a
revelation
of
new
emotions
to
her
she
was
always
a
silent
child
her
mind
was
so
full
of
strange
thoughts
that
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
say
many
words
the
things
she
thought
as
she
followed
her
from
room
to
room
from
floor
to
floor
until
they
reached
the
locked
door
would
have
amazed
and
puzzled
jane
foster
if
she
had
known
of
their
existence
most
of
all
perhaps
she
would
have
been
puzzled
by
the
effect
the
closed
door
had
upon
the
child
it
puzzled
and
bewildered
judith
herself
and
made
her
feel
a
little
weary
she
wanted
so
much
to
go
into
the
room
without
in
the
least
understanding
the
feeling
she
was
quite
shaken
by
it
it
seemed
as
if
the
closing
of
all
the
other
rooms
would
have
been
a
small
matter
in
comparison
with
the
closing
of
this
one
there
was
something
inside
which
she
wanted
to
see
there
was
something
somehow
there
was
something
which
wanted
to
see
her
what
a
pity
that
the
door
was
locked
why
had
it
been
done
she
sighed
unconsciously
several
times
during
the
evening
and
jane
foster
thought
she
was
tired
but
you
sleep
cool
enough
judy
she
said
and
get
a
good
rest
them
little
breezes
that
comes
rustling
through
the
trees
in
the
park
comes
right
along
the
street
to
us
she
and
jem
foster
slept
well
they
spent
the
evening
in
the
highest
spirits
and
as
it
seemed
to
them
the
most
luxurious
comfort
the
space
afforded
them
by
the
big
basement
with
its
kitchen
and
laundry
and
pantry
and
above
all
the
specially
large
room
which
had
been
used
for
billiard
playing
supplied
actual
vistas
for
the
sake
of
convenience
and
coolness
they
used
the
billiard
room
as
a
dormitory
sleeping
on
light
cots
and
they
slept
with
all
their
windows
open
the
little
breezes
wandering
from
among
the
trees
of
the
park
to
fan
them
how
they
laughed
and
enjoyed
themselves
over
their
supper
and
how
they
stretched
themselves
out
with
sighs
of
joy
in
the
darkness
as
they
sank
into
the
cool
untroubled
waters
of
deep
sleep
this
is
about
the
top
notch
jem
murmured
as
he
lost
his
hold
on
the
world
of
waking
life
and
work
but
though
she
was
cool
though
she
was
undisturbed
though
her
body
rested
in
absolute
repose
judith
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
she
lay
and
listened
to
the
quietness
there
was
mystery
in
it
the
footstep
of
a
belated
in
the
street
woke
strange
echoes
a
voice
heard
in
the
distance
in
a
riotous
shout
suggested
weird
things
and
as
she
lay
and
listened
it
was
as
if
she
were
not
only
listening
but
waiting
for
something
she
did
not
know
at
all
what
she
was
waiting
for
but
waiting
she
was
she
lay
upon
her
cot
with
her
arms
flung
out
and
her
eyes
wide
open
what
was
it
that
she
wanted
that
which
was
in
the
closed
room
why
had
they
locked
the
door
if
they
had
locked
the
doors
of
the
big
parlours
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
they
had
locked
the
door
of
the
library
her
mind
paused
as
if
for
a
moment
something
held
it
still
then
she
remembered
that
to
have
locked
the
doors
of
the
library
would
have
been
to
lock
in
the
picture
of
the
child
with
the
greeting
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
fine
little
uplifted
hand
she
was
glad
the
room
had
been
left
open
but
the
room
the
one
on
the
fourth
floor
that
was
the
one
that
mattered
most
of
all
she
knew
that
she
must
go
and
stand
at
the
door
and
press
her
cheek
against
the
wood
and
wait
and
listen
thinking
this
and
knowing
that
it
must
be
so
she
fell
at
last
asleep
part
two
judith
climbed
the
basement
stairs
rather
slowly
her
mother
was
busy
rearranging
the
disorder
the
hastily
departing
servants
had
left
their
departure
had
indeed
been
made
in
sufficient
haste
to
have
left
behind
the
air
of
its
having
been
flight
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
done
and
jane
foster
moving
about
with
broom
and
pail
and
scrubbing
brushes
did
not
dislike
the
excitement
of
the
work
before
her
judith
certainty
that
she
would
not
be
missed
made
all
clear
before
her
if
her
absence
was
observed
her
mother
would
realize
that
the
whole
house
lay
open
to
her
and
that
she
was
an
undisturbing
element
wheresoever
she
was
led
either
by
her
fancy
or
by
circumstance
if
she
went
into
the
parlours
she
would
probably
sit
and
talk
to
herself
or
play
quietly
with
her
shabby
doll
in
any
case
she
would
be
finding
pleasure
of
her
own
and
would
touch
nothing
which
could
be
harmed
when
the
child
found
herself
in
the
entrance
hall
she
stopped
a
few
moments
to
look
about
her
the
stillness
seemed
to
hold
her
and
she
paused
to
hear
and
feel
it
in
leaving
the
basement
behind
she
had
left
the
movement
of
living
behind
also
no
one
was
alive
upon
this
floor
nor
upon
the
next
nor
the
next
it
was
as
if
one
had
entered
a
new
world
a
world
in
which
something
existed
which
did
not
express
itself
in
sound
or
in
things
which
one
could
see
chairs
held
out
their
arms
to
emptiness
cushions
were
not
pressed
by
living
things
only
the
people
in
the
pictures
were
looking
at
something
but
one
could
not
tell
what
they
were
looking
at
but
on
the
fourth
floor
was
the
closed
room
which
she
must
go
to
because
she
must
go
to
it
that
was
all
she
knew
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
upper
floors
her
shabby
doll
was
held
against
her
hip
by
one
arm
her
right
hand
touched
the
wall
as
she
went
she
felt
the
height
of
the
wall
as
she
looked
upward
it
was
such
a
large
house
and
so
empty
where
had
the
people
gone
and
why
had
they
left
it
all
at
once
as
if
they
were
afraid
her
father
had
only
heard
vaguely
that
they
had
gone
because
they
had
had
trouble
she
passed
the
second
floor
the
third
and
climbed
towards
the
fourth
she
could
see
the
door
of
the
closed
room
as
she
went
up
step
by
step
and
she
found
herself
moving
more
quickly
yes
she
must
get
to
it
she
must
put
her
hand
on
it
her
chest
began
to
rise
and
fall
with
a
quickening
of
her
breath
and
her
breath
quickened
because
her
heart
fluttered
as
if
with
her
haste
she
began
to
be
glad
and
if
any
one
could
have
seen
her
they
would
have
been
struck
by
a
curious
expectant
smile
in
her
eyes
she
reached
the
landing
and
crossed
it
running
the
last
few
steps
lightly
she
did
not
wait
or
stand
still
a
moment
with
the
strange
expectant
smile
on
her
lips
as
well
as
in
her
eyes
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
door
not
upon
the
handle
but
upon
the
panel
without
any
sound
it
swung
quietly
open
and
without
any
sound
she
stepped
quietly
inside
the
room
was
rather
large
and
the
light
in
it
was
dim
there
were
no
shutters
but
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
judith
went
to
one
of
the
windows
and
drew
its
blind
up
so
that
the
look
of
the
place
might
be
clear
to
her
there
were
two
windows
and
they
opened
upon
the
flat
roof
of
an
extension
which
suggested
somehow
that
it
had
been
used
as
a
place
to
walk
about
in
this
at
least
was
what
judith
thought
of
at
once
that
some
one
who
had
used
the
room
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
out
upon
the
roof
and
staying
there
as
if
it
had
been
a
sort
of
garden
there
were
rows
of
flower
pots
with
dead
flowers
in
them
there
were
green
tubs
containing
large
shrubs
which
were
dead
also
against
the
low
parapet
certain
of
them
held
climbing
plants
which
had
been
trained
upon
it
two
had
been
climbing
roses
two
were
clematis
but
judith
did
not
know
them
by
name
the
ledge
of
the
window
was
so
low
that
a
mere
step
took
her
outside
so
taking
it
she
stood
among
the
dried
withered
things
and
looked
in
tender
regret
at
them
i
wish
they
were
not
dead
she
said
softly
to
the
silence
it
would
be
like
a
garden
if
they
were
not
dead
the
sun
was
hot
but
a
cool
little
breeze
seemed
straying
up
from
among
the
trees
of
the
park
it
even
made
the
dried
leaves
of
the
flowers
tremble
and
rustle
a
little
involuntarily
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
blue
sky
and
floating
white
clouds
they
seemed
so
near
that
she
felt
almost
as
if
she
could
touch
them
with
her
hand
the
street
seemed
so
far
so
far
below
the
whole
world
seemed
far
below
if
one
stepped
off
the
parapet
it
would
surely
take
one
a
long
time
to
reach
the
earth
she
knew
now
why
she
had
come
up
here
it
was
so
that
she
might
feel
like
this
as
if
she
was
upheld
far
away
from
things
as
if
she
had
left
everything
behind
almost
as
if
she
had
fallen
awake
again
there
was
no
perfume
in
the
air
but
all
was
still
and
sweet
and
clear
suddenly
she
turned
and
went
into
the
room
again
realizing
that
she
had
scarcely
seen
it
at
all
and
that
she
must
see
and
know
it
it
was
not
like
any
other
room
she
had
seen
it
looked
more
simple
though
it
was
a
pretty
place
the
walls
were
covered
with
roses
there
were
bright
pictures
and
shelves
full
of
books
there
was
also
a
little
writing
desk
and
there
were
two
or
three
low
chairs
and
a
low
table
a
closet
in
a
corner
had
its
door
ajar
and
judith
could
see
that
inside
toys
were
piled
together
in
another
corner
a
large
doll
house
stood
looking
as
if
some
one
had
just
stopped
playing
with
it
some
toy
furniture
had
been
taken
out
and
left
near
it
upon
the
carpet
it
was
a
little
girl
room
judith
said
why
did
they
close
it
her
eye
was
caught
by
something
lying
on
a
sofa
something
covered
with
a
cloth
it
looked
almost
like
a
child
lying
there
asleep
so
fast
asleep
that
it
did
not
stir
at
all
judith
moved
across
to
the
sofa
and
drew
the
cloth
aside
with
its
head
upon
a
cushion
was
lying
there
a
very
large
doll
beautifully
dressed
in
white
lace
its
eyes
closed
and
a
little
wreath
of
dead
flowers
in
its
hair
it
looks
almost
as
if
it
had
died
too
said
judith
she
did
not
ask
herself
why
she
said
as
if
it
had
died
too
perhaps
it
was
because
the
place
was
so
still
and
everything
so
far
away
that
the
flowers
had
died
in
the
strange
little
deserted
garden
on
the
roof
she
did
not
hear
any
footsteps
in
fact
no
ghost
of
a
sound
stirred
the
silence
as
she
stood
looking
at
the
doll
sleep
but
quite
quickly
she
ceased
to
bend
forward
and
turned
round
to
look
at
something
which
she
knew
was
near
her
there
she
was
and
it
was
quite
natural
she
should
be
there
the
little
girl
with
the
face
like
a
white
flower
with
the
quantity
of
burnished
coppery
hair
and
the
smile
which
deepened
the
already
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
you
have
come
to
play
with
me
she
said
yes
answered
judith
i
wanted
to
come
all
night
i
could
not
stay
no
said
the
child
you
ca
stay
lift
up
the
doll
they
began
to
play
as
if
they
had
spent
their
lives
together
neither
asked
the
other
any
questions
judith
had
not
played
with
other
children
but
with
this
one
she
played
in
absolute
and
lovely
delight
the
little
girl
knew
where
all
the
toys
were
and
there
were
a
great
many
beautiful
ones
she
told
judith
where
to
find
them
and
how
to
arrange
them
for
their
games
she
invented
wonderful
things
to
do
things
which
were
so
unlike
anything
judith
had
ever
seen
or
heard
or
thought
of
that
it
was
not
strange
that
she
realized
afterwards
that
all
her
past
life
and
its
belongings
had
been
so
forgotten
as
to
be
wholly
blotted
out
while
she
was
in
the
closed
room
she
did
not
know
her
name
she
did
not
remember
that
there
were
such
things
as
names
every
moment
was
happiness
every
moment
the
little
girl
seemed
to
grow
more
beautiful
in
the
flower
whiteness
of
her
face
and
hands
and
the
strange
lightness
and
freedom
of
her
movements
there
was
an
ecstasy
in
looking
at
her
in
feeling
her
near
not
long
before
judith
went
she
found
herself
standing
with
her
outside
the
window
in
among
the
withered
flowers
it
was
my
garden
the
little
girl
said
it
has
been
so
hot
and
no
one
has
been
near
to
water
them
so
they
could
not
live
she
went
lightly
to
one
of
the
brown
and
put
her
little
hand
quite
near
it
she
did
not
touch
it
but
held
her
hand
near
and
the
leaves
began
to
stir
and
uncurl
and
become
fresh
and
tender
again
and
roses
were
nodding
blooming
on
the
stems
and
she
went
in
the
same
manner
to
each
flower
and
plant
in
turn
until
all
the
before
dreary
little
garden
was
bright
and
full
of
leaves
and
flowers
it
life
she
said
to
judith
judith
nodded
and
smiled
back
at
her
understanding
quite
well
just
as
she
had
understood
the
eyes
of
the
bird
who
had
swung
on
the
twig
so
near
her
cheek
the
day
she
had
hidden
among
the
bushes
in
the
park
now
you
must
go
the
little
girl
said
at
last
and
judith
went
out
of
the
room
at
once
without
waiting
or
looking
back
though
she
knew
the
white
figure
did
not
stir
till
she
was
out
of
sight
it
was
not
until
she
had
reached
the
second
floor
that
the
change
came
upon
her
it
was
a
great
change
and
a
curious
one
the
closed
room
became
as
far
away
as
all
other
places
and
things
had
seemed
when
she
had
stood
upon
the
roof
feeling
the
nearness
of
the
blueness
and
the
white
clouds
as
when
she
had
looked
round
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
child
in
the
closed
room
she
suddenly
realized
things
she
had
not
known
before
she
knew
that
she
had
heard
no
voice
when
the
little
girl
spoke
to
her
she
knew
that
it
had
happened
that
it
was
she
only
who
had
lifted
the
doll
who
had
taken
out
the
toys
who
had
arranged
the
low
table
for
their
feast
putting
all
the
small
service
upon
it
and
though
they
had
played
with
such
rapturous
enjoyment
and
had
laughed
and
feasted
what
had
they
feasted
on
that
she
could
not
recall
and
not
once
had
she
touched
or
been
touched
by
the
light
hand
or
white
dress
and
though
they
seemed
to
express
their
thoughts
and
intentions
freely
she
had
heard
no
voice
at
all
she
was
suddenly
bewildered
and
stood
rubbing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
but
she
was
happy
as
happy
as
when
she
had
fallen
awake
in
her
sleep
and
was
no
more
troubled
or
really
curious
than
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
the
same
experience
every
day
of
her
life
well
you
must
have
been
having
a
good
time
playing
jane
foster
said
when
she
entered
the
big
kitchen
this
is
going
to
do
you
good
judy
looks
like
she
had
a
day
in
the
country
do
she
jem
through
the
weeks
that
followed
her
habit
of
playing
was
accepted
as
a
perfectly
natural
thing
no
questions
were
asked
and
she
knew
it
was
not
necessary
to
enter
into
any
explanations
every
day
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
closed
room
and
finding
it
closed
at
a
touch
of
her
hand
upon
the
panel
it
swung
softly
open
there
she
waited
sometimes
for
a
longer
sometimes
for
a
shorter
time
and
the
child
with
the
coppery
hair
came
to
her
the
world
below
was
gone
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
and
through
the
hours
they
played
together
joyously
as
happy
children
play
but
in
their
playing
it
was
always
judith
who
touched
the
toys
who
held
the
doll
set
the
little
table
for
their
feast
once
as
she
went
she
remembered
that
when
she
had
that
day
made
a
wreath
of
roses
from
the
roof
and
had
gone
to
put
it
on
her
playmate
head
she
had
drawn
back
with
deepened
dimple
and
holding
up
her
hand
had
said
laughing
no
do
not
touch
me
but
there
was
no
mystery
in
it
after
all
judith
knew
she
should
presently
understand
she
was
so
happy
that
her
happiness
lived
in
her
face
in
a
sort
of
delicate
brilliance
jane
foster
observed
the
change
in
her
with
exceeding
comfort
her
view
being
that
spacious
quarters
fresh
air
and
sounder
sleep
had
done
great
things
for
her
them
big
eyes
of
hers
ai
like
no
other
child
eyes
i
ever
seen
she
said
to
her
husband
with
cheerful
an
her
skin
that
fine
an
thin
an
fair
you
can
jest
see
through
it
she
always
looks
to
me
as
if
she
was
made
out
of
different
stuff
from
me
an
you
jem
i
always
said
it
she
going
to
make
a
corking
handsome
girl
responded
jem
with
a
chuckle
they
had
been
in
the
house
two
months
when
one
afternoon
as
she
was
slicing
potatoes
for
supper
jane
looked
round
to
see
the
child
standing
at
the
kitchen
doorway
looking
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
some
wilted
flowers
she
held
in
her
hand
impression
was
that
she
had
been
coming
into
the
room
and
had
stopped
suddenly
to
look
at
what
she
held
what
you
got
there
judy
she
asked
they
flowers
said
judith
her
eyes
still
more
puzzled
where
you
get
from
i
did
know
you
been
out
i
thought
you
was
i
was
said
judith
quite
simply
in
the
closed
room
jane
foster
knife
dropped
into
her
pan
with
a
splash
well
she
gasped
judith
looked
at
her
with
quiet
eyes
the
closed
room
jane
cried
out
what
are
you
saying
you
could
get
in
yes
i
can
jane
was
conscious
of
experiencing
a
shock
she
said
afterwards
that
suddenly
something
gave
her
the
creeps
you
could
open
the
door
she
persisted
i
tried
it
again
yesterday
as
i
passed
by
turned
the
handle
and
gave
it
a
regular
shove
and
it
would
give
an
inch
yes
the
child
answered
i
heard
you
we
were
inside
then
a
few
days
later
when
jane
weepingly
related
the
incident
to
and
sympathizing
friends
she
described
as
graphically
as
her
limited
vocabulary
would
allow
her
to
do
so
the
look
in
judith
face
as
she
came
nearer
to
her
do
tell
me
there
was
nothing
happening
then
she
said
she
just
came
up
to
me
with
them
dead
flowers
in
her
hand
an
a
kind
of
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
was
half
sorry
for
me
an
know
quite
why
door
opens
for
me
she
says
where
i
play
every
day
there
a
little
girl
comes
and
plays
with
me
she
comes
in
at
the
window
i
think
she
is
like
the
picture
in
the
room
where
the
books
are
her
hair
hangs
down
and
she
has
a
dimple
near
her
mouth
i
could
never
tell
any
one
what
i
felt
like
it
was
as
if
got
a
queer
fright
that
i
did
understand
must
have
come
over
the
roof
from
the
next
house
i
says
got
an
extension
too
but
i
thought
the
people
were
gone
away
are
flowers
on
our
roof
she
said
got
these
there
and
that
puzzled
look
came
into
her
eyes
again
were
beautiful
when
i
got
them
but
as
i
came
they
died
of
all
the
queer
things
i
said
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
my
arm
sort
of
lovin
an
timid
wanted
to
tell
you
mother
she
said
had
to
tell
you
you
do
mind
if
i
go
play
with
her
do
you
you
do
mind
perhaps
it
was
because
she
touched
me
that
queer
little
loving
way
or
was
it
the
way
she
looked
it
seemed
like
something
came
over
me
an
i
just
grabbed
her
an
hugged
her
up
i
says
as
you
come
back
so
as
you
come
back
and
to
think
and
jane
rocked
herself
sobbing
a
point
she
dwelt
on
with
many
tears
was
that
the
child
seemed
in
a
wistful
mood
and
remained
near
her
side
bringing
her
little
chair
and
sitting
by
her
as
she
worked
and
rising
to
follow
her
from
place
to
place
as
she
moved
from
one
room
to
the
other
she
was
never
one
as
kissed
you
much
or
hung
about
like
some
children
do
i
always
used
to
say
she
was
the
least
bother
of
any
child
i
ever
knew
seemed
as
if
she
had
company
of
her
own
when
she
sat
in
her
little
chair
in
the
corner
whispering
to
herself
or
just
setting
quiet
this
was
a
thing
jane
always
added
during
all
the
years
in
which
she
told
the
story
that
was
what
made
me
notice
she
kept
by
me
and
she
kept
looking
at
me
different
from
any
way
i
seen
her
look
before
not
pitiful
exactly
but
something
like
it
and
once
she
came
up
and
kissed
me
and
once
or
twice
she
just
kind
of
touched
my
dress
or
my
hand
as
i
stood
by
her
she
knew
no
one
need
tell
me
she
did
but
this
was
an
error
the
child
was
conscious
only
of
a
tender
wistful
feeling
which
caused
her
to
look
at
the
affectionate
healthy
young
woman
who
had
always
been
good
to
her
and
whom
she
belonged
to
though
she
remotely
wondered
why
the
same
tenderness
impelled
her
to
touch
her
arm
hand
and
simple
dress
and
folding
her
arms
round
her
neck
to
kiss
her
softly
it
was
an
expression
of
gratitude
for
all
the
rough
casual
affection
of
the
past
all
her
life
had
been
spent
at
her
side
all
her
life
on
earth
had
sprung
from
her
when
she
went
to
the
closed
room
the
next
day
she
told
her
mother
she
was
going
before
she
left
the
kitchen
i
going
up
to
play
with
the
little
girl
mother
she
said
you
do
mind
do
you
jane
had
had
an
evening
of
comfortable
domestic
gossip
and
joking
with
jem
had
slept
slept
soundly
and
eaten
a
hearty
breakfast
life
had
reassumed
its
wholly
normal
aspect
the
sun
was
shining
hot
and
bright
and
she
was
preparing
to
scrub
the
kitchen
floor
she
believed
that
the
child
was
mistaken
as
to
the
room
she
had
been
in
that
all
right
she
said
turning
the
hot
water
spigot
over
the
sink
so
that
the
boiling
water
poured
forth
at
full
flow
into
her
pail
with
clouds
of
steam
but
when
i
done
my
scrubbing
i
comin
up
to
see
if
it
is
the
closed
room
you
play
in
if
it
is
i
guess
you
better
play
somewhere
else
and
i
want
to
find
out
how
you
get
that
door
open
run
along
if
you
like
judith
came
back
to
her
from
the
door
yes
she
said
come
and
see
but
if
she
is
there
putting
her
hand
on
jane
hip
gently
you
must
touch
her
jane
turned
off
the
hot
water
and
stared
her
the
little
girl
who
plays
never
touch
her
she
says
i
must
not
jane
lifted
her
pail
from
the
sink
laughing
outright
well
that
sounds
as
if
she
was
a
pretty
airy
young
one
she
said
i
guess
you
a
queer
little
pair
run
on
i
must
get
at
this
floor
judith
ran
up
the
three
flights
of
stairs
lightly
she
was
glad
she
had
told
her
mother
though
she
wondered
vaguely
why
it
had
never
seemed
right
to
tell
her
until
last
night
and
last
night
it
had
seemed
not
so
much
necessary
as
imperative
something
had
obliged
her
to
tell
her
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
know
the
closed
room
door
had
always
shut
itself
gently
after
judith
had
passed
through
it
and
yesterday
when
her
mother
passing
by
chance
had
tried
the
handle
so
vigorously
the
two
children
inside
the
room
had
stood
still
gazing
at
each
other
but
neither
had
spoken
and
judith
had
not
thought
of
speaking
she
was
out
of
the
realm
of
speech
and
without
any
sense
of
amazement
was
aware
that
she
was
out
of
it
people
with
voices
and
words
were
in
that
faraway
world
below
the
playing
was
even
a
lovelier
happier
thing
than
it
had
ever
been
before
it
seemed
to
become
each
minute
a
thing
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
world
in
the
streets
where
the
elevated
railroad
went
humming
past
like
a
monster
bee
and
with
the
sense
of
greater
distance
came
a
sense
of
greater
lightness
and
freedom
judith
found
that
she
was
moving
about
the
room
and
the
little
roof
garden
almost
exactly
as
she
had
moved
in
the
waking
dreams
where
she
saw
aunt
hester
almost
as
if
she
was
floating
and
every
movement
was
ecstasy
once
as
she
thought
this
she
looked
at
her
playmate
and
the
child
smiled
and
answered
her
as
she
always
did
before
she
spoke
yes
she
said
i
know
her
she
will
come
she
sent
me
she
had
this
day
a
special
plan
with
regard
to
the
arranging
of
the
closed
room
she
wanted
all
the
things
in
it
the
doll
the
chairs
the
toys
the
little
table
and
its
service
to
be
placed
in
certain
positions
she
told
judith
what
to
do
various
toys
were
put
here
or
there
the
little
table
was
set
with
certain
dishes
in
a
particular
part
of
the
room
a
book
was
left
lying
upon
the
sofa
cushion
the
large
doll
was
put
into
a
chair
near
the
sofa
with
a
smaller
doll
in
its
arms
on
the
small
writing
desk
a
letter
which
judith
found
in
a
drawer
a
letter
was
laid
the
pen
was
left
in
the
ink
it
was
a
strange
game
to
play
but
somehow
judith
felt
it
was
very
pretty
when
it
was
all
done
and
there
were
many
curious
things
to
do
the
closed
room
looked
quite
different
from
the
cold
dim
orderly
place
the
door
had
first
opened
upon
then
it
had
looked
as
if
everything
had
been
swept
up
and
set
away
and
covered
and
done
with
forever
as
if
the
life
in
it
had
ended
and
would
never
begin
again
now
it
looked
as
if
some
child
who
had
lived
in
it
and
loved
and
played
with
each
of
its
belongings
had
just
stepped
out
from
her
play
to
some
other
room
quite
near
quite
near
the
big
doll
in
its
chair
seemed
waiting
even
listening
to
her
voice
as
it
came
from
the
room
she
had
run
into
the
child
with
the
burnished
hair
stood
and
looked
at
it
with
her
delicious
smile
that
is
how
it
looked
she
said
they
came
and
hid
and
covered
everything
as
if
i
had
gone
as
if
i
was
nowhere
i
want
her
to
know
i
come
here
i
could
do
it
myself
you
could
do
it
for
me
go
and
bring
some
roses
the
little
garden
was
a
wonder
of
strange
beauty
with
its
masses
of
flowers
judith
brought
some
roses
from
the
bush
her
playmate
pointed
out
she
put
them
into
a
light
bowl
which
was
like
a
bubble
of
thin
clear
glass
and
stood
on
the
desk
near
the
letter
if
they
would
look
like
that
the
little
girl
said
she
would
see
but
no
one
sees
them
like
that
when
the
life
goes
away
with
me
after
that
the
game
was
finished
and
they
went
out
on
the
roof
garden
and
stood
and
looked
up
into
the
blue
above
their
heads
how
blue
how
blue
how
clear
how
near
and
real
and
how
far
and
unreal
the
streets
and
sounds
below
the
two
children
stood
and
looked
up
and
laughed
at
the
sweetness
of
it
then
judith
felt
a
little
tired
i
will
go
and
lie
down
on
the
sofa
she
said
yes
the
little
girl
answered
it
time
for
you
to
go
to
sleep
they
went
into
the
closed
room
and
judith
lay
down
as
she
did
so
she
saw
that
the
door
was
standing
open
and
remembered
that
her
mother
was
coming
up
to
see
her
and
her
playmate
the
little
girl
sat
down
by
her
she
put
out
her
pretty
fine
hand
and
touched
judith
for
the
first
time
she
laid
her
little
pointed
fingers
on
her
forehead
and
judith
fell
asleep
it
seemed
only
a
few
minutes
before
she
wakened
again
the
little
girl
was
standing
by
her
come
she
said
they
went
out
together
onto
the
roof
among
the
flowers
but
a
strange
a
beautiful
thing
had
happened
the
garden
did
not
end
at
the
parapet
and
the
streets
and
houses
were
not
below
the
little
garden
ended
in
a
broad
green
pathway
green
with
thick
soft
grass
and
moss
covered
with
trembling
white
and
blue
flowers
trees
fresh
leaved
as
if
spring
had
just
awakened
them
shaded
it
and
made
it
look
smiling
fair
great
white
blossoms
tossed
on
their
branches
and
judith
felt
that
the
scent
in
the
air
came
from
them
she
forgot
the
city
was
below
because
it
was
millions
and
millions
of
miles
away
and
this
was
where
it
was
right
to
be
there
was
no
mistake
this
was
real
all
the
rest
was
unreal
and
millions
and
millions
of
miles
away
they
held
each
other
hands
and
stepped
out
upon
the
broad
fresh
green
pathway
there
was
no
boundary
or
end
to
its
beauty
and
it
was
only
another
real
thing
that
coming
towards
them
from
under
the
white
flowering
trees
was
aunt
hester
in
the
basement
jane
foster
was
absorbed
in
her
labours
which
were
things
whose
accustomedness
provided
her
with
pleasure
she
was
fond
of
her
scrubbing
she
enjoyed
the
washing
of
her
dishes
she
definitely
entertained
herself
with
the
splash
and
soapy
foam
of
her
washtubs
and
the
hearty
smack
and
swing
of
her
ironing
in
the
days
when
she
had
served
at
the
ribbon
counter
in
a
department
store
she
had
not
found
life
as
agreeable
as
she
had
found
it
since
the
hours
which
were
not
spent
at
her
own
private
sewing
machine
were
given
to
hearty
domestic
duties
providing
cleanliness
savoury
meals
and
comfort
for
jem
she
was
so
busy
this
particular
afternoon
that
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
forget
all
else
but
the
work
which
kept
her
on
her
knees
scrubbing
floors
or
on
a
chair
polishing
windows
and
afterwards
hanging
before
them
bits
of
clean
spotted
muslin
she
was
doing
this
last
when
her
attention
being
attracted
by
wheels
in
the
street
stopping
before
the
door
she
looked
out
to
see
a
carriage
door
open
and
a
young
woman
dressed
in
exceptionally
deep
mourning
garb
step
onto
the
pavement
cross
it
and
ascend
the
front
steps
who
she
jane
exclaimed
disturbedly
does
she
think
the
house
is
to
let
because
it
shut
a
ring
at
the
front
door
bell
called
her
down
from
her
chair
among
the
duties
of
a
caretaker
is
naturally
included
that
of
answering
the
questions
of
visitors
she
turned
down
her
sleeves
put
on
a
fresh
apron
and
ran
to
the
entrance
hall
when
she
opened
the
door
the
tall
young
woman
in
black
stepped
inside
as
if
there
were
no
reason
for
her
remaining
even
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
i
am
haldon
she
said
i
suppose
you
are
the
caretaker
haldon
was
the
name
of
the
people
to
whom
the
house
belonged
jem
foster
had
heard
only
the
vaguest
things
of
them
but
jane
remembered
that
the
name
was
haldon
and
remembering
that
they
had
gone
away
because
they
had
had
trouble
she
recognized
at
a
glance
what
sort
of
trouble
it
had
been
haldon
was
tall
and
young
and
to
jane
foster
mind
expressed
from
head
to
foot
the
perfection
of
all
that
spoke
for
wealth
and
fashion
her
garments
were
heavy
and
rich
with
crape
the
long
black
veil
which
she
had
thrown
back
swept
over
her
shoulder
and
hung
behind
her
serving
to
set
forth
as
it
were
more
pitifully
the
white
wornness
of
her
pretty
face
and
a
sort
of
haunting
eagerness
in
her
haggard
eyes
she
had
been
a
smart
lovely
laughing
and
lovable
thing
full
of
pleasure
in
the
world
and
now
she
was
so
stricken
and
devastated
that
she
seemed
set
apart
in
an
awful
lonely
world
of
her
own
she
had
no
sooner
crossed
the
threshold
than
she
looked
about
her
with
a
quick
smitten
glance
and
began
to
tremble
jane
saw
her
look
shudder
away
from
the
open
door
of
the
front
room
where
the
chairs
had
seemed
left
as
if
set
for
some
gathering
and
the
flowers
had
been
scattered
on
the
floor
she
fell
into
one
of
the
carved
hall
seats
and
dropped
her
face
into
her
hands
her
elbows
resting
on
her
knees
oh
no
no
she
cried
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
believe
it
jane
foster
eyes
filled
with
ready
tears
of
sympathy
wo
you
come
she
said
would
you
like
to
set
in
your
own
room
perhaps
no
no
was
the
answer
she
was
always
there
she
used
to
come
into
my
bed
in
the
morning
she
used
to
watch
me
dress
to
go
out
no
no
i
open
the
shutters
in
the
library
said
jane
oh

would
be
sitting
on
the
big
sofa
with
her
fairy
she
everywhere
everywhere
how
could

but

could

i
tried
to
stay
in
the
mountains
but
i
could
something
dragged
me
day
and
night
nobody
knows
i
am
here
she
got
up
and
looked
about
her
again
i
have
never
been
in
here
since
i
went
out
with
her
she
said
they
would
not
let
me
come
back
they
said
it
would
kill
me
and
now
i
have
come
and
everything
is
here
all
the
things
we
lived
with
and
she
is
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
miles
away
who
who
was
it
jane
asked
timidly
in
a
low
voice
it
was
my
little
girl
the
poor
young
beauty
said
it
was
my
little
andrea
her
portrait
is
in
the
library
jane
began
to
tremble
somewhat
herself
that
she
began
and
ended
she
is
dead
haldon
had
dragged
herself
almost
as
if
unconsciously
to
the
stairs
she
leaned
against
the
newel
post
and
her
face
dropped
upon
her
hand
oh
i
do
know
she
cried
i
can
not
believe
it
how
could
it
be
she
was
playing
in
her
nursery
laughing
and
playing
and
she
ran
into
the
next
room
to
show
me
a
flower
and
as
she
looked
up
at
me
laughing
i
tell
you
laughing
she
sank
slowly
down
on
her
knees
and
the
flower
fell
out
of
her
hand
quietly
and
everything
went
out
of
her
face
everything
was
gone
away
from
her
and
there
was
never
anything
more
never
jane
foster
hand
had
crept
up
to
her
throat
she
did
not
know
what
made
her
cold
my
little
girl
she
began
her
name
is
judith
where
is
she
said
haldon
in
a
breathless
way
she
is
jane
answered
slowly
she
goes
into
that
back
room
on
the
fourth
floor
haldon
turned
upon
her
with
wide
eyes
it
is
locked
she
said
they
put
everything
away
i
have
the
key
the
door
opens
for
her
said
jane
she
goes
to
play
with
a
little
girl
who
comes
to
her
i
think
she
comes
over
the
roof
from
the
next
house
there
is
no
child
there
haldon
shuddered
but
it
was
not
with
horror
there
was
actually
a
wild
dawning
bliss
in
her
face
what
is
she
like
she
is
like
the
picture
jane
scarcely
knew
her
own
monotonous
voice
the
world
of
real
things
was
being
withdrawn
from
her
and
she
was
standing
without
its
pale
alone
with
this
woman
and
her
wild
eyes
she
began
to
shiver
because
her
warm
blood
was
growing
cold
she
is
a
child
with
red
hair
and
there
is
a
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
judith
told
me
you
must
not
touch
her
she
heard
a
wild
gasp
a
flash
of
something
at
once
anguish
and
rapture
blazed
across
the
haggard
young
face
and
with
a
swerving
as
if
her
slight
body
had
been
swept
round
by
a
sudden
great
wind
haldon
turned
and
fled
up
the
stairs
jane
foster
followed
the
great
wind
swept
her
upward
too
she
remembered
no
single
intake
or
outlet
of
breath
until
she
was
upon
the
fourth
floor
the
door
of
the
closed
room
stood
wide
open
and
haldon
was
swept
within
jane
foster
saw
her
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
second
a
tall
swaying
figure
she
whirled
to
look
about
her
and
flung
up
her
arms
with
an
unearthly
rapturous
whispered
cry
it
is
all
as
she
left
it
when
she
ran
to
me
and
fell
she
has
been
here
to
show
me
it
is
not
so
far
she
sank
slowly
upon
her
knees
wild
happiness
in
her
face
wild
tears
pouring
down
it
she
has
seen
her
and
she
stretched
forth
yearning
arms
towards
the
little
figure
of
judith
who
lay
quiet
upon
the
sofa
in
the
corner
your
little
girl
has
seen
her
and
i
dare
not
waken
her
she
is
asleep
jane
stood
by
the
sofa
looking
down
when
she
bent
and
touched
the
child
the
stillness
of
the
room
seemed
to
have
got
into
her
blood
no
she
said
quivering
but
with
a
strange
simplicity
no
not
asleep
it
was
this
way
with
her
aunt
hester
the
end
