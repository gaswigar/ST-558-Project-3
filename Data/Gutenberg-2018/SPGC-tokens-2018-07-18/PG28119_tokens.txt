slesar
as
we
have
said
before
is
a
young
advertising
executive
who
has
rapidly
become
one
of
the
better
known
writers
in
the
field
here
is
an
story
that
is
guaranteed
to
make
some
of
you
take
a
very
searching
second
look
at
some
of
the
young
men
you
my
father
the
cat
henry
he
wondered
if
i
told
her
everything
and
faltering
i
had
to
admit
that
i
had
she
was
wonderful
but
human
my
mother
was
a
lovely
delicate
woman
from
the
coast
of
brittany
who
was
miserable
sleeping
on
less
than
three
mattresses
and
who
it
is
said
was
once
injured
by
a
falling
leaf
in
her
garden
my
grandfather
a
descendant
of
the
french
nobility
whose
family
had
ridden
the
tumbrils
of
the
revolution
tended
her
fragile
body
and
spirit
with
the
same
loving
care
given
rare
flowers
you
may
imagine
from
this
his
attitude
concerning
marriage
he
lived
in
terror
of
the
vulgar
man
who
would
one
day
win
my
mother
heart
and
at
last
this
persistent
dread
killed
him
his
concern
was
unnecessary
however
for
my
mother
chose
a
suitor
who
was
as
free
of
mundane
brutality
as
a
husband
could
be
her
choice
was
dauphin
a
remarkable
white
cat
which
strayed
onto
the
estate
shortly
after
his
death
dauphin
was
an
unusually
large
angora
and
his
ability
to
speak
in
cultured
french
english
and
italian
was
sufficient
to
cause
my
mother
to
adopt
him
as
a
household
pet
it
did
not
take
long
for
her
to
realize
that
dauphin
deserved
a
higher
status
and
he
became
her
friend
protector
and
confidante
he
never
spoke
of
his
origin
nor
where
he
had
acquired
the
classical
education
which
made
him
such
an
entertaining
companion
after
two
years
it
was
easy
for
my
mother
an
unworldly
woman
at
best
to
forget
the
dissimilarity
in
their
species
in
fact
she
was
convinced
that
dauphin
was
an
enchanted
prince
and
dauphin
in
consideration
of
her
illusions
never
dissuaded
her
at
last
they
were
married
by
an
understanding
clergyman
of
the
locale
who
solemnly
filled
in
the
marriage
application
with
the
name
of
edwarde
dauphin
i
etienne
dauphin
am
their
son
to
be
candid
i
am
a
handsome
youth
not
unlike
my
mother
in
the
delicacy
of
my
features
my
father
heritage
is
evident
in
my
large
feline
eyes
and
in
my
slight
body
and
quick
movements
my
death
when
i
was
four
left
me
in
the
charge
of
my
father
and
his
coterie
of
loyal
servants
and
i
could
not
have
wished
for
a
finer
upbringing
it
is
to
my
father
patient
tutoring
that
i
owe
whatever
graces
i
now
possess
it
was
my
father
the
cat
whose
gentle
paws
guided
me
to
the
treasure
houses
of
literature
art
and
music
whose
whiskers
bristled
with
pleasure
at
a
goose
well
cooked
at
a
meal
well
served
at
a
wine
well
chosen
how
many
happy
hours
we
shared
he
knew
more
of
life
and
the
humanities
my
father
the
cat
than
any
human
i
have
met
in
all
my
years
until
the
age
of
eighteen
my
education
was
his
personal
challenge
then
it
was
his
desire
to
send
me
into
the
world
outside
the
gates
he
chose
for
me
a
university
in
america
for
he
was
deeply
fond
of
what
he
called
that
great
raw
country
where
he
believed
my
feline
qualities
might
be
tempered
by
the
aggressiveness
of
the
barking
dogs
i
would
be
sure
to
meet
i
must
confess
to
a
certain
amount
of
unhappiness
in
my
early
american
years
torn
as
i
was
from
the
comforts
of
the
estate
and
the
wisdom
of
my
father
the
cat
but
i
became
adapted
and
even
upon
my
graduation
from
the
university
sought
and
held
employment
in
a
metropolitan
art
museum
it
was
there
i
met
joanna
the
young
woman
i
intended
to
make
my
bride
joanna
was
a
product
of
the
great
american
southwest
the
daughter
of
a
there
was
a
blooming
vitality
in
her
face
and
her
body
a
lustiness
born
of
open
skies
and
desert
her
hair
was
not
the
gold
of
antiquity
it
was
new
gold
freshly
mined
from
the
black
rock
her
eyes
were
not
like
diamonds
their
sparkle
was
that
of
sunlight
on
a
cascading
river
her
figure
was
bold
an
open
declaration
of
her
sex
she
was
perhaps
an
unusual
choice
for
the
son
of
mother
and
an
angora
cat
but
from
the
first
meeting
of
our
eyes
i
knew
that
i
would
someday
bring
joanna
to
my
father
estate
to
present
her
as
my
fiancee
i
approached
that
occasion
with
understandable
trepidation
my
father
had
been
explicit
in
his
advice
before
i
departed
for
america
but
on
no
point
had
he
been
more
emphatic
than
secrecy
concerning
himself
he
assured
me
that
revelation
of
my
paternity
would
bring
ridicule
and
unhappiness
upon
me
the
advice
was
sound
of
course
and
not
even
joanna
knew
that
our
journey
end
would
bring
us
to
the
estate
of
a
large
cultured
and
conversing
cat
i
had
deliberately
fostered
the
impression
that
i
was
orphaned
believing
that
the
proper
place
for
revealing
the
truth
was
the
atmosphere
of
my
father
home
in
france
i
was
certain
that
joanna
would
accept
her
without
distress
indeed
had
nearly
a
score
of
human
servants
remained
devoted
to
their
feline
master
for
almost
a
generation
we
had
agreed
to
be
wed
on
the
first
of
june
and
on
may
the
fourth
emplaned
in
new
york
for
paris
we
were
met
at
orly
field
by
francois
my
father
solemn
manservant
who
had
been
delegated
not
so
much
as
escort
as
he
was
chaperone
my
father
having
retained
much
of
the
old
world
proprieties
it
was
a
long
trip
by
automobile
to
our
estate
in
brittany
and
i
must
admit
to
a
brooding
silence
throughout
the
drive
which
frankly
puzzled
joanna
however
when
the
great
stone
fortress
that
was
our
home
came
within
view
my
fears
and
doubts
were
quickly
dispelled
joanna
like
so
many
americans
was
thrilled
at
the
aura
of
venerability
and
royal
custom
surrounding
the
estate
francois
placed
her
in
charge
of
madame
jolinet
who
clapped
her
plump
old
hands
with
delight
at
the
sight
of
her
fresh
blonde
beauty
and
chattered
and
clucked
like
a
mother
hen
as
she
led
joanna
to
her
room
on
the
second
floor
as
for
myself
i
had
one
immediate
wish
to
see
my
father
the
cat
he
greeted
me
in
the
library
where
he
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
our
arrival
curled
up
in
his
favorite
chair
by
the
fireside
a
goblet
of
cognac
by
his
side
as
i
entered
the
room
he
lifted
a
paw
formally
but
then
his
reserve
was
dissolved
by
the
emotion
of
our
reunion
and
he
licked
my
face
in
unashamed
joy
francois
refreshed
his
glass
and
poured
another
for
me
and
we
toasted
each
other
to
you
i
said
using
the
affectionate
name
of
my
childhood
memory
to
joanna
my
father
said
he
smacked
his
lips
over
the
cognac
and
wiped
his
whiskers
gravely
and
where
is
this
paragon
with
madame
jolinet
she
will
be
down
shortly
and
you
have
told
her
everything
i
blushed
no
i
have
not
i
thought
it
best
to
wait
until
we
were
home
she
is
a
wonderful
woman
i
added
impulsively
she
will
not
be
horrified
my
father
said
what
makes
you
so
certain
my
son
because
she
is
a
woman
of
great
heart
i
said
stoutly
she
was
educated
at
a
fine
college
for
women
in
eastern
america
her
ancestors
were
rugged
people
given
to
legend
and
folklore
she
is
a
warm
human
person
human
my
father
sighed
and
his
tail
swished
you
are
expecting
too
much
of
your
beloved
etienne
even
a
woman
of
the
finest
character
may
be
dismayed
in
this
situation
but
my
mother
your
mother
was
an
exception
a
changeling
of
the
fairies
you
must
not
look
for
your
mother
soul
in
joanna
eyes
he
jumped
from
his
chair
and
came
towards
me
resting
his
paw
upon
my
knee
i
am
glad
you
have
not
spoken
of
me
etienne
now
you
must
keep
your
silence
forever
i
was
shocked
i
reached
down
and
touched
my
father
silky
fur
saddened
by
the
look
of
his
age
in
his
gray
eyes
and
by
the
tinge
of
yellow
in
his
white
coat
no
i
said
joanna
must
know
the
truth
joanna
must
know
how
proud
i
am
to
be
the
son
of
edwarde
dauphin
then
you
will
lose
her
never
that
can
not
happen
my
father
walked
stiffly
to
the
fireplace
staring
into
the
gray
ashes
ring
for
francois
he
said
let
him
build
the
fire
i
am
cold
etienne
i
walked
to
the
cord
and
pulled
it
my
father
turned
to
me
and
said
you
must
wait
my
son
at
dinner
this
evening
perhaps
do
not
speak
of
me
until
then
very
well
father
when
i
left
the
library
i
encountered
joanna
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
and
she
spoke
to
me
excitedly
oh
etienne
what
a
old
house
i
know
i
will
love
it
may
we
see
the
rest
of
course
i
said
you
look
troubled
is
something
wrong
no
no
i
was
thinking
how
lovely
you
are
we
embraced
and
her
warm
full
body
against
mine
confirmed
my
conviction
that
we
should
never
be
parted
she
put
her
arm
in
mine
and
we
strolled
through
the
great
rooms
of
the
house
she
was
ecstatic
at
their
size
and
elegance
exclaiming
over
the
carpeting
the
gnarled
furniture
the
ancient
silver
and
pewter
the
gallery
of
family
paintings
when
she
came
upon
an
early
portrait
of
my
mother
her
eyes
misted
she
was
lovely
joanna
said
like
a
princess
and
what
of
your
father
is
there
no
portrait
of
him
no
i
said
hurriedly
no
portrait
i
had
spoken
my
first
lie
to
joanna
for
there
was
a
painting
which
my
mother
had
begun
in
the
last
year
of
her
life
it
was
a
whispering
little
watercolor
and
joanna
discovered
it
to
my
consternation
what
a
magnificent
cat
she
said
was
it
a
pet
it
is
dauphin
i
said
nervously
she
laughed
he
has
your
eyes
etienne
joanna
i
must
tell
you
something
and
this
ferocious
gentleman
with
the
moustaches
who
is
he
my
grandfather
joanna
you
must
listen
francois
who
had
been
following
our
inspection
tour
at
interrupted
i
suspected
that
his
timing
was
no
mere
coincidence
we
will
be
serving
dinner
at
he
said
if
the
lady
would
care
to
dress
of
course
joanna
said
will
you
excuse
me
etienne
i
bowed
to
her
and
she
was
gone
at
fifteen
minutes
to
the
appointed
dining
time
i
was
ready
and
hastened
below
to
talk
once
more
with
my
father
he
was
in
the
dining
room
instructing
the
servants
as
to
the
placement
of
the
silver
and
accessories
my
father
was
proud
of
the
excellence
of
his
table
and
took
all
his
meals
in
the
splendid
manner
his
appreciation
of
food
and
wine
was
unsurpassed
in
my
experience
and
it
had
always
been
the
greatest
of
pleasures
for
me
to
watch
him
at
table
stalking
across
the
damask
and
dipping
delicately
into
the
silver
dishes
prepared
for
him
he
pretended
to
be
too
busy
with
his
dinner
preparations
to
engage
me
in
conversation
but
i
insisted
i
must
talk
to
you
i
said
we
must
decide
together
how
to
do
this
it
will
not
be
easy
he
answered
with
a
twinkle
consider
view
a
cat
as
large
and
as
old
as
myself
is
cause
enough
for
comment
a
cat
that
speaks
is
alarming
a
cat
that
dines
at
table
with
the
household
is
shocking
and
a
cat
whom
you
must
introduce
as
your
stop
it
i
cried
joanna
must
know
the
truth
you
must
help
me
reveal
it
to
her
then
you
will
not
heed
my
advice
in
all
things
but
this
our
marriage
can
never
be
happy
unless
she
accepts
you
for
what
you
are
and
if
there
is
no
marriage
i
would
not
admit
to
this
possibility
joanna
was
mine
nothing
could
alter
that
the
look
of
pain
and
bewilderment
in
my
eyes
must
have
been
evident
to
my
father
for
he
touched
my
arm
gently
with
his
paw
and
said
i
will
help
you
etienne
you
must
give
me
your
trust
always
then
come
to
dinner
with
joanna
and
explain
nothing
wait
for
me
to
appear
i
grasped
his
paw
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
thank
you
father
he
turned
to
francois
and
snapped
you
have
my
instructions
yes
sir
the
servant
replied
then
all
is
ready
i
shall
return
to
my
room
now
etienne
you
may
bring
your
fiancee
to
dine
i
hastened
up
the
stairway
and
found
joanna
ready
strikingly
beautiful
in
shimmering
white
satin
together
we
descended
the
grand
staircase
and
entered
the
room
her
eyes
shone
at
the
magnificence
of
the
service
set
upon
the
table
at
the
soldiery
array
of
fine
wines
some
of
them
already
poured
into
their
proper
glasses
for
my
father
enjoyment
from
authentic
and
an
american
import
from
the
napa
valley
of
which
he
was
fond
i
waited
expectantly
for
his
appearance
as
we
sipped
our
aperitif
while
joanna
chatted
about
innocuous
matters
with
no
idea
of
the
tormented
state
i
was
in
at
eight
my
father
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
and
i
grew
ever
more
distraught
as
francois
signalled
for
the
serving
of
the
au
had
he
changed
his
mind
would
i
be
left
to
explain
my
status
without
his
help
i
had
realized
until
this
moment
how
difficult
a
task
i
had
allotted
for
myself
and
the
fear
of
losing
joanna
was
terrible
within
me
the
soup
was
flat
and
tasteless
on
my
tongue
and
the
misery
in
my
manner
was
too
apparent
for
joanna
to
miss
what
is
it
etienne
she
said
you
been
so
morose
all
day
you
tell
me
what
wrong
no
it
nothing
it
just
i
let
the
impulse
take
possession
of
my
speech
joanna
there
something
i
should
tell
you
about
my
mother
and
my
father
ahem
francois
said
he
turned
to
the
doorway
and
our
glances
followed
his
oh
etienne
joanna
cried
in
a
voice
ringing
with
delight
it
was
my
father
the
cat
watching
us
with
his
gray
eyes
he
approached
the
dining
table
regarding
joanna
with
timidity
and
caution
it
the
cat
in
the
painting
joanna
said
you
did
tell
me
he
was
here
etienne
he
beautiful
joanna
this
is
dauphin
i
would
have
known
him
anywhere
here
dauphin
here
kitty
kitty
kitty
slowly
my
father
approached
her
outstretched
hand
and
allowed
her
to
scratch
the
thick
fur
on
the
back
of
his
neck
are
you
the
pretty
little
pussy
are
you
the
sweetest
little
thing
joanna
she
lifted
my
father
by
the
haunches
and
held
him
in
her
lap
stroking
his
fur
and
cooing
the
silly
little
words
that
women
address
to
their
pets
the
sight
pained
and
confused
me
and
i
sought
to
find
an
opening
word
that
would
allow
me
to
explain
yet
hoping
all
the
time
that
my
father
would
himself
provide
the
answer
then
my
father
spoke
meow
he
said
are
you
hungry
joanna
asked
solicitously
is
the
little
pussy
hungry
meow
my
father
said
and
i
believed
my
heart
broke
then
and
there
he
leaped
from
her
lap
and
padded
across
the
room
i
watched
him
through
blurred
eyes
as
he
followed
francois
to
the
corner
where
the
servant
had
placed
a
shallow
bowl
of
milk
he
lapped
at
it
eagerly
until
the
last
white
drop
was
gone
then
he
yawned
and
stretched
and
trotted
back
to
the
doorway
with
one
fleeting
glance
in
my
direction
that
spoke
articulately
of
what
i
must
do
next
what
a
wonderful
animal
joanna
said
yes
i
answered
he
was
my
mother
