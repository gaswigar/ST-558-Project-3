introduction
there
is
no
need
for
any
one
to
explain
to
the
working
men
and
women
in
america
what
this
pamphlet
is
written
for
or
why
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
have
this
information
they
know
better
than
i
could
tell
them
so
i
shall
not
try
i
have
tried
to
give
the
knowledge
of
the
best
french
and
dutch
physicians
translated
into
the
simplest
english
that
all
may
easily
understand
there
are
various
and
numerous
mechanical
means
of
prevention
which
i
have
not
mentioned
here
mainly
because
i
have
not
come
into
personal
contact
with
those
who
have
used
them
or
could
recommend
them
as
entirely
satisfactory
i
feel
there
is
sufficient
information
given
here
which
if
followed
will
prevent
a
woman
from
becoming
pregnant
unless
she
desires
to
do
so
if
a
woman
is
too
indolent
to
wash
and
cleanse
herself
and
the
man
too
selfish
to
consider
the
consequences
of
the
act
then
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
a
preventive
to
keep
the
woman
from
becoming
pregnant
of
course
it
is
troublesome
to
get
up
to
douche
it
is
also
a
nuisance
to
have
to
trouble
about
the
date
of
the
menstrual
period
it
seems
inartistic
and
sordid
to
insert
a
pessary
or
a
suppository
in
anticipation
of
the
sexual
act
but
it
is
far
more
sordid
to
find
yourself
several
years
later
burdened
down
with
half
a
dozen
unwanted
children
helpless
starved
shoddily
clothed
dragging
at
your
skirt
yourself
a
dragged
out
shadow
of
the
woman
you
once
were
do
be
over
sentimental
in
this
important
phase
of
hygiene
the
inevitable
fact
is
that
unless
you
prevent
the
male
sperm
from
entering
the
womb
you
are
going
to
become
pregnant
women
of
the
working
class
especially
wage
workers
should
not
have
more
than
two
children
at
most
the
average
working
man
can
support
no
more
and
the
average
working
woman
can
take
care
of
no
more
in
decent
fashion
it
has
been
my
experience
that
more
children
are
not
really
wanted
but
that
the
women
are
compelled
to
have
them
either
from
lack
of
foresight
or
through
ignorance
of
the
hygiene
of
preventing
conception
it
is
only
the
workers
who
are
ignorant
of
the
knowledge
of
how
to
prevent
bringing
children
in
the
world
to
fill
jails
and
hospitals
factories
and
mills
insane
asylums
and
premature
graves
the
working
women
can
use
direct
action
by
refusing
to
supply
the
market
with
children
to
be
exploited
by
refusing
to
populate
the
earth
with
slaves
it
is
also
the
one
most
direct
method
for
you
working
women
to
help
yourself
pass
on
this
information
to
your
neighbor
and
comrade
workers
write
out
any
of
the
following
information
which
you
are
sure
will
help
her
and

it

it

a
nurse
advice
to
women
every
woman
who
is
desirous
of
preventing
conception
will
follow
this
advice
do
wait
to
see
if
you
do
menstruate
monthly
sickness
but
make
it
your
duty
to
see
that
you
if
you
are
due
to
be
sick
on
the
eighth
of
august
do
not
wait
until
the
eighth
to
see
but
begin
as
early
as
the
fourth
to
take
a
good
laxative
for
the
bowels
and
continue
this
each
night
until
the
eighth
if
there
is
the
slightest
possibility
that
the
male
fluid
has
entered
the
vagina
take
on
these
same
nights
before
retiring
five
or
ten
grains
of
quinine
with
a
hot
drink
the
quinine
in
capsule
form
is
considered
fresher
but
if
this
is
taken
do
not
use
alcoholic
drinks
directly
after
as
it
hardens
the
capsules
thus
delaying
the
action
of
the
quinine
by
taking
the
above
precautions
you
will
prevent
the
ovum
from
making
its
nest
in
the
lining
of
the
womb
women
of
intelligence
who
refuse
to
have
children
until
they
are
ready
for
them
keep
definite
track
of
the
date
of
their
menstrual
periods
a
calendar
should
be
kept
on
which
can
be
marked
the
date
of
the
last
menstruation
as
well
as
the
date
when
the
next
period
should
occur
women
must
learn
to
know
their
own
bodies
and
watch
and
know
definitely
how
regular
or
irregular
they
are
if
the
period
comes
regularly
every
days
normal
or
every
thirty
days
as
is
in
the
case
of
many
young
girls
mark
it
accordingly
on
your
private
calendar
do
not
leave
it
to
memory
or
guess
work
only
ignorance
and
indifference
will
cause
one
to
be
careless
in
this
most
important
matter
a
very
good
laxative
though
it
is
a
patent
medicine
is
beechams
pills
two
of
these
taken
night
and
morning
four
days
before
menstruation
will
give
a
good
cleansing
of
the
bowels
and
assist
with
the
menstrual
flow
castor
oil
is
also
a
good
laxative
the
american
physicians
may
object
to
this
advice
because
beechams
pills
are
a
patent
medicine
but
until
they
are
willing
to
give
open
advice
on
this
subject
we
must
resort
to
such
as
the
least
harmful
until
such
time
as
they
do
if
a
woman
will
give
herself
attention
before
the
menstrual
period
arrives
she
will
almost
never
have
any
trouble
but
if
she
neglects
herself
and
waits
to
see
if
she
comes
around
she
is
likely
to
have
difficulty
if
the
action
of
quinine
has
not
expelled
the
semen
from
the
uterus
and
a
week
has
elapsed
with
no
signs
of
the
menstrual
flow
then
it
is
safe
to
assume
conception
has
taken
place
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
development
of
the
fertilized
ovum
is
called
an
abortion
no
one
can
doubt
that
there
are
times
where
an
abortion
is
justifiable
but
they
will
become
when
care
is
taken
to
prevent
this
is
the
cure
for
abortions
there
is
current
among
people
an
idea
that
conception
can
take
place
only
at
certain
times
of
the
month
for
instance
ten
days
after
the
menstrual
period
and
four
or
five
days
before
the
next
period
this
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
at
all
for
it
has
been
proven
again
and
again
that
a
woman
can
conceive
at
any
time
in
the
month
do
not
depend
upon
this
belief
for
there
is
no
reliable
foundation
for
it
there
is
also
the
knowledge
that
nursing
after
prevents
the
return
of
the
menstrual
flow
for
several
months
and
conception
does
not
take
place
it
is
well
not
to
depend
upon
this
too
much
especially
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
month
for
often
a
woman
becomes
pregnant
again
without
having
seen
anything
or
without
her
realizing
that
she
has
become
pregnant
she
thus
finds
herself
with
one
at
the
breast
and
another
in
the
womb
use
some
preventative
again
it
is
believed
that
conception
can
not
take
place
if
the
woman
lies
upon
her
left
side
at
the
time
of
the
act
it
makes
no
difference
which
side
she
lies
upon
she
can
become
pregnant
if
the
semen
is
not
prevented
from
entering
the
womb
perhaps
the
commonest
preventive
excepting
the
use
of
the
condom
is
coitus
interrupts
or
withdrawal
of
the
penis
from
the
vagina
shortly
before
the
action
of
the
semen
no
one
can
doubt
that
this
is
a
perfectly
safe
method
and
it
is
not
considered
so
dangerous
to
the
man
as
some
authorities
have
formerly
viewed
it
but
it
requires
a
man
of
the
strongest
willpower
to
be
certain
that
he
has
withdrawn
before
any
of
the
semen
has
been
deposited
in
the
vagina
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
exactly
whether
this
has
been
done
the
greatest
objection
to
this
is
the
evil
effect
upon
the
woman
nervous
condition
if
she
has
not
completed
her
desire
she
is
under
a
highly
nervous
tension
her
whole
being
is
perhaps
on
the
verge
of
satisfaction
she
is
then
left
in
this
dissatisfied
state
this
does
her
injury
a
mutual
and
satisfied
sexual
act
is
of
great
benefit
to
the
average
woman
the
magnetism
of
it
is
health
giving
when
it
is
not
desired
on
the
part
of
the
woman
and
she
has
no
response
should
not
take
this
is
an
act
of
prostitution
and
is
degrading
to
the
woman
finer
sensibility
all
the
marriage
certificates
on
earth
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
withdrawal
on
the
part
of
the
man
should
be
substituted
by
some
other
means
that
does
not
injure
the
woman
douches
and
their
importance
the
most
important
part
which
every
woman
should
learn
in
the
methods
of
preventing
conception
is
to
cleanse
herself
thoroughly
by
means
of
the
vaginal
douche
after
the
sexual
act
go
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
bath
room
and
prepare
a
douche
lie
down
upon
the
back
in
the
bath
tub
hang
the
filled
douche
bag
high
over
the
tub
and
let
the
water
flow
freely
into
the
vagina
to
wash
out
the
male
sperm
which
was
deposited
during
the
act
do
not
be
afraid
to
assist
the
cleansing
by
introducing
the
first
finger
with
the
tube
and
washing
out
the
semen
from
the
folds
of
the
membrane
one
can
soon
learn
to
tell
by
the
feeling
when
it
is
sufficiently
clean
it
is
said
that
the
french
women
are
the
most
thorough
douchers
in
the
world
which
helps
greatly
in
keeping
the
organs
in
a
clean
and
healthy
condition
as
well
as
preventing
the
male
sperm
from
reaching
the
womb
to
mate
with
the
ovum
following
are
some
of
the
solutions
to
be
used
for
the
douche
which
when
carefully
used
will
kill
the
male
sperm
or
prevent
its
entering
the
womb
lysol
is
a
brown
oily
liquid
which
added
to
water
forms
a
clear
soapy
solution
one
teaspoonful
of
lysol
to
quarts
of
water
warm
makes
a
good
solution
for
douching
mix
into
a
pitcher
or
vessel
before
placing
it
in
the
bag
get
the
tablets
blue
or
white
from
the
druggist
the
blue
are
less
dangerous
to
have
about
because
of
the
color
always
mix
this
solution
thoroughly
in
a
glass
or
pitcher
before
turning
it
into
the
bag
never
drop
the
tablet
directly
into
the
bag
one
tablet
to
two
quarts
of
water
makes
a
splendid
solution
for
preventive
purposes
potassium
permanganate
this
also
makes
a
good
solution
especially
where
there
is
a
vaginal
discharge
the
special
objection
to
this
is
that
it
stains
the
skin
and
clothing
this
can
be
purchased
in
crystal
form
and
one
teaspoonful
dissolved
in
two
quarts
of
water
is
the
proper
strength
chinosol
is
highly
recommended
as
a
vaginal
douche
as
being
less
injurious
to
the
membranes
than
salt
solution
mix
four
tablespoons
of
table
salt
in
one
quart
of
warm
or
cold
water
and
dissolve
thoroughly
this
is
good
and
cheap
vinegar
solution
many
peasants
in
europe
use
vinegar
as
an
antiseptic
almost
exclusively
one
glassful
to
two
quarts
of
water
is
the
strength
usually
desired
cider
vinegar
is
preferred
douche
afterward
with
clear
water
cold
water
douche
this
will
sometimes
remove
the
semen
quite
effectively
without
the
aid
of
an
antiseptic
but
as
the
semen
can
hide
itself
away
in
the
wrinkled
lining
of
the
vaginal
cavity
the
cold
water
will
only
impede
its
progress
for
a
time
as
soon
as
the
warmth
of
the
body
revives
its
activity
the
semen
continues
on
its
journey
to
meet
the
ovum
every
woman
should
possess
a
good
two
quart
rubber
douche
bag
called
fountain
syringe
hang
it
high
enough
to
insure
a
steady
direct
flow
bulb
syringes
such
as
the
whirling
spray
syringes
have
been
found
satisfactory
by
many
women
for
the
purpose
of
injecting
antiseptic
solutions
directions
with
syringe
illustration
fountain
syringe
some
women
use
the
douche
before
the
sexual
act
as
a
preventive
if
this
is
done
any
astringent
such
as
boric
acid
alum
citric
acid
of
quinine
used
in
the
solution
will
do
only
a
pint
of
solution
is
needed
for
this
purpose
following
the
act
a
larger
douche
is
used
as
a
cleanser
this
can
also
be
allowed
with
the
regular
antiseptic
douche
the
use
of
the
condom
or
cots
there
is
little
doubt
that
a
thorough
douching
of
the
genital
passage
with
an
antiseptic
solution
performed
by
skilled
hands
immediately
after
the
sexual
act
would
destroy
the
male
sperm
and
nothing
else
would
be
necessary
but
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
sperm
has
entered
the
womb
before
the
solution
can
reach
it
it
is
safer
therefore
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
contact
of
the
semen
and
the
ovum
by
the
interposition
of
a
wall
between
them
one
of
the
best
is
the
condom
or
rubber
cot
these
are
made
of
soft
tissues
which
envelope
the
male
organ
penis
completely
and
serve
to
catch
the
semen
at
the
time
of
the
act
in
this
way
the
sperm
does
not
enter
the
vagina
the
condoms
are
obtainable
at
all
drug
stores
at
various
prices
from
two
dollars
a
dozen
for
the
skin
gut
tissues
to
one
fifty
a
dozen
for
the
rubber
tissue
these
are
seamless
thin
and
elastic
and
yet
tough
if
properly
adjusted
will
not
break
fear
of
breaking
is
the
main
objection
to
their
use
if
space
has
not
been
allowed
for
expansion
of
the
penis
at
the
time
the
semen
is
expelled
the
tissue
is
likely
to
split
and
the
sperm
finds
its
way
into
the
uterus
the
woman
becomes
pregnant
without
being
conscious
of
it
if
on
the
other
hand
care
is
given
to
the
adjustment
of
the
condom
not
fitting
it
too
close
it
will
act
as
one
of
the
best
protectors
against
both
conception
and
venereal
disease
care
must
be
exercised
in
withdrawing
the
penis
after
the
act
not
to
allow
the
condom
to
peel
off
thereby
allowing
the
semen
to
pass
into
the
vagina
it
is
desirable
to
discard
the
condom
after
it
has
been
used
once
but
as
this
is
not
always
done
care
must
be
taken
to
wash
the
condom
in
an
antiseptic
solution
before
drying
it
and
placing
it
away
for
further
use
the
condom
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
known
preventatives
in
the
united
states
it
has
another
value
quite
apart
from
prevention
in
decreasing
the
tendency
in
the
male
to
arrive
at
the
climax
in
the
sexual
act
before
the
female
there
are
few
men
and
women
so
perfectly
mated
that
the
climax
of
the
act
is
reached
together
it
is
usual
for
the
male
to
arrive
at
this
stage
earlier
than
the
female
with
the
consequence
that
he
is
further
incapacitated
to
satisfy
her
desire
for
some
time
after
during
this
time
the
woman
is
in
a
highly
nervous
condition
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
best
medical
authorities
that
a
continuous
condition
of
this
unsatisfied
state
brings
on
or
causes
disease
of
her
generative
organs
besides
giving
her
a
perfect
horror
and
repulsion
for
the
sexual
act
thousands
of
well
meaning
men
ask
the
advice
of
physicians
as
to
the
cause
of
the
sexual
coldness
and
indifference
of
their
wives
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
is
the
fault
of
the
man
who
through
ignorance
and
selfishness
and
inconsiderateness
has
satisfied
his
own
desire
and
promptly
gone
off
to
sleep
the
woman
in
self
defense
has
learned
to
protect
herself
from
the
long
hours
of
sleepless
nights
and
nervous
tension
by
refusing
to
become
interested
the
condom
will
often
help
in
this
difficulty
there
are
many
girls
who
have
had
no
education
on
this

no

of
the
physiology
of
the
act
who
upon
any
contact
of
the
semen
have
a
disgust
and
repulsion
from
which
it
takes
some
time
to
recover
much
depends
upon
the
education
of
the
girl
but
more
depends
upon
the
attitude
of
the
man
toward
the
relation
the
pessary
and
the
sponge
another
form
of
prevention
is
the
pessary
see
cut
this
is
one
of
the
most
common
preventive
articles
used
in
france
as
well
as
among
the
women
of
the
middle
and
upper
class
in
america
at
one
time
the
cost
of
these
ranged
up
to
seven
dollars
as
they
were
imported
into
this
country
from
france
today
they
are
manufactured
in
this
country
and
may
be
had
from
fifty
cents
up
to
two
dollars
the
mizpath
is
the
name
of
one
of
the
best
and
costs
one
dollar
and
a
half
at
any
reliable
drug
store
they
come
in
three
sizes
large
medium
and
small
it
is
well
to
get
the
medium
size
as
the
small
ones
are
only
for
very
small
boned
women
and
easily
get
out
of
place

slightly
different
from
the
american
in
my
estimation
a
well
fitted
pessary
is
the
surest
method
of
absolutely
preventing
conception
i
have
known
hundreds
of
women
who
have
used
it
for
years
with
the
most
satisfactory
results
the
trouble
is
women
are
afraid
of
their
own
bodies
and
are
of
course
ignorant
of
their
physical
construction
they
are
silly
in
thinking
the
pessary
can
go
up
too
far
or
that
it
could
get
lost
and
therefore
discard
it
it
can
not
get
into
the
womb
neither
can
it
get
lost
the
only
thing
it
can
do
is
to
come
out
and
even
that
will
give
warning
by
the
discomfort
of
the
bulky
feeling
it
causes
when
it
is
out
of
place
follow
the
directions
given
with
each
box
and
learn
to
adjust
it
correctly
one
can
soon
feel
that
it
is
on
right
after
the
pessary
has
been
placed
into
the
vagina
deeply
it
can
be
fitted
well
over
the
neck
of
the
womb
one
can
feel
it
is
fitted
by
pressing
the
finger
around
the
soft
part
of
the
pessary
which
should
completely
cover
the
mouth
of
the
womb
if
it
is
properly
adjusted
there
will
be
no
discomfort
the
man
will
be
unconscious
that
anything
is
used
and
no
germ
or
semen
can
enter
the
womb

if

should
fall

directly
after
no
harm
can
happen
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
a
douche
until
the
following
morning
take
part
or
about
a
quart
of
an
antiseptic
douche
before
the
pessary
is
removed
after
removing

continue

wash

one
should
last
two
years
if
cared
for
i
recommend
the
use
of
the
pessary
as
the
most
convenient
the
cheapest
and
the
safest
any
nurse
or
doctor
will
teach
one
how
to
adjust
it
then
women
can
teach
each
other
it
is
not
advisable
to
wear
the
pessary
all
the
time
take
it
out
after
using
and
wear
it
only
when
needed
a
little
experience
will
teach
one
that
to
place
it
is
a
simple
matter
sponges
sponges
can
also
be
had
at
the
drug
store
they
have
a
tap
attached
to
them
to
be
conveniently
removed
they
should
be
soaked
in
an
antiseptic
solution
for
a
few
minutes
before
coitus
and
then
introduced
into
the
vagina
far
up
as
they
can
be
placed
some
physicians
have
recommended
the
use
of
the
cotton
plug
instead
of
the
sponge
to
be
soaked
in
a
solution
of
three
per
cent
carbolic
and
glycerine
before
the
act
the
male
sperm
is
destroyed
by
the
weakest
solution
of
carbolic
acid
some
of
the
peasants
in
europe
use
the
cotton
plug
soaked
in
vinegar
for
the
same
purpose
and
find
it
satisfactory
in
this
country
a
boric
acid
solution
has
been
used
for
the
same
purpose
and
with
satisfactory
results
of
course
this
requires
a
saturated
solution
as
for
instance
one
teaspoonful
of
the
powder
to
a
cup
of
water
stirred
until
dissolved
sponges
and
plugs
can
be
recommended
as
perfectly
safe
if
followed
by
an
antiseptic
douche
before
the
removal
of
the
plug
or
sponge
thus
preventing
the
sperm
from
entering
the
womb
the
problem
is
to
kill
the
male
sperm
upon
entering
the
vagina
or
to
wash
it
out
or
to
kill
it
directly
afterwards
a
weak
solution
of
alum
may
also
be
used
for
cotton
plugs
and
sponges
carbolated

on
vaginal
suppositories
suppositories
are
becoming
more
generally
used
in
than
any
other
method
of
prevention
these
may
be
found
at
any
reliable
pharmacy
the
majority
of
them
are
made
from
cocoa
butter
or
gelatine
which
makes
it
necessary
that
they
be
deposited
in
the
vagina
several
minutes
before
the
act
in
order
for
them
to
melt
special
ingredients

all

is
the

manufactured
by
the
chinosol
company
they
are
to
be
secured
at
any
reliable
druggist
upon
demand
they
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
place
they
are
not
poisonous
and
cause
no
injury
to
the
membranes
they
are
distributed
into
a
box
costing
cents
the
prescription
quoted
above
can
be
made
up
more
cheaply
however
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
rural
districts
in
france
the
peasant
women
make
up
their
preventive
suppositories
themselves
placing
them
carefully
away
in
glass
jars
this
is
one
of
the
recipes
which
has
been
used

and
put
in

place
i
have
given
in
the
foregoing
pages
the
most
commonly
known
means
of
prevention
personally
i
recommend
every
woman
to
use
a
well
fitted
pessary
and
learn
to
adjust
it
carbozine
tablets
obtainable
from
the

laboratory
south
broadway
louis
are
highly
recommended
as
an
antiseptic
and
cleanser
by
farmer
wives
and
others
residing
in
rural
districts
a
highly
recommended
suppository
similar
to
those
made
and
used
successfully
in
germany
for
over
twenty
years
is
now
obtainable
from

birth
control
or
family
limitation
has
been
recommended
by
some
of
the
leading
physicians
of
the
united
states
and
europe
the
movement
can
no
longer
be
set
back
by
setting
up
the
false
cry
of
obscenity
it
has
already
been
incorporated
into
the
private
moral
code
of
millions
of
the
most
influential
families
in
every
civilized
country
it
will
shortly
win
full
acceptation
and
sanction
by
public
morality
as
well
in
cases
of
women
suffering
from
serious
ailments
such
as
disease
heart
disease
insanities
melancholia
idiocy
consumption
and
syphilis
all
a
physician
is
allowed
to
do
is
to
tide
these
women
through
their
pregnancies
if
possible
even
though
the
life
of
the
woman
is
positively
endangered
he
can
not
relieve
her
without
calling
a
colleague
in
consultation
therefore
the
mortality
of
mothers
suffering
from
these
diseases
and
their
infants
is
very
high
and
premature
births
common
to
conserve
the
lives
of
these
mothers
and
to
prevent
the
birth
of
diseased
or
defective
children
are
factors
emphasizing
the
crying
need
of
a
sound
and
sane
educational
campaign
for
birth
control
