because
he
has
given
me
permission
to
tell
my
story
because
he
has
read
that
story
and
knows
i
try
to
speak
the

i
believe
that
he
is
and

preface
the
initial
idea
of
the
compilation
of
this
work
was
to
give
the
reading
public
an
authentic
record
of
the
private
life
of
the
apache
indians
and
to
extend
to
geronimo
as
a
prisoner
of
war
the
courtesy
due
any
captive
the
right
to
state
the
causes
which
impelled
him
in
his
opposition
to
our
civilization
and
laws
if
the
indians
cause
has
been
properly
presented
the
captives
defense
clearly
stated
and
the
general
store
of
information
regarding
vanishing
types
increased
i
shall
be

i
desire
to
acknowledge
valuable

charles

introductory
i
first
met
geronimo
in
the
summer
of
when
i
acted
for
him
as
interpreter
of
english
into
spanish
and
vice
versa
in
selling
a
war
bonnet
after
that
he
always
had
a
pleasant
word
for
me
when
we
met
but
never
entered
into
a
general
conversation
with
me
until
he
learned
that
i
had
once
been
wounded
by
a
mexican
as
soon
as
he
was
told
of
this
he
came
to
see
me
and
expressed
freely
his
opinion
of
the
average
mexican
and
his
aversion
to
all
mexicans
in
general
i
invited
him
to
visit
me
again
which
he
did
and
upon
his
invitation
i
visited
him
at
his
tepee
in
the
fort
sill
military
reservation
in
the
summer
of
greenwood
superintendent
of
schools
at
kansas
city
missouri
visited
me
and
i
took
him
to
see
the
chief
geronimo
was
quite
formal
and
reserved
until
greenwood
said
i
am
a
friend
of
general
howard
whom
i
have
heard
speak
of
you
come
said
geronimo
and
led
the
way
to
a
shade
had
seats
brought
for
us
put
on
his
war
bonnet
and
served
watermelon
cut
in
big
chunks
while
he
talked
freely
and
cheerfully
when
we
left
he
gave
us
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
him
again
in
a
few
days
the
old
chief
came
to
see
me
and
asked
about
my
father
i
said
you
mean
the
old
gentleman
from
kansas
city
he
has
returned
to
his
home
he
is
you
father
said
geronimo
no
i
said
my
father
died
years
ago
greenwood
is
only
my
friend
after
a
moment
silence
the
old
indian
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
tone
of
voice
intended
to
carry
conviction
or
at
least
to
allow
no
further
discussion
your
natural
father
is
dead
this
man
has
been
your
friend
and
adviser
from
youth
by
adoption
is
your
tell
him
he
is
welcome
to
come
to
my
home
at
any
time
it
was
of
no
use
to
explain
any
more
for
the
old
man
had
determined
not
to
understand
my
relation
to
greenwood
except
in
accordance
with
indian
customs
and
i
let
the
matter
drop
in
the
latter
part
of
that
summer
i
asked
the
old
chief
to
allow
me
to
publish
some
of
the
things
he
had
told
me
but
he
objected
saying
however
that
if
i
would
pay
him
and
if
the
officers
in
charge
did
not
object
he
would
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
his
life
i
immediately
called
at
the
fort
fort
sill
and
asked
the
officer
in
charge
lieutenant
purington
for
permission
to
write
the
life
of
geronimo
i
was
promptly
informed
that
the
privilege
would
not
be
granted
lieutenant
purington
explained
to
me
the
many
depredations
committed
by
geronimo
and
his
warriors
and
the
enormous
cost
of
subduing
the
apaches
adding
that
the
old
apache
deserved
to
be
hanged
rather
than
spoiled
by
so
much
attention
from
civilians
a
suggestion
from
me
that
our
government
had
paid
many
soldiers
and
officers
to
go
to
arizona
and
kill
geronimo
and
the
apaches
and
that
they
did
not
seem
to
know
how
to
do
it
did
not
prove
very
gratifying
to
the
pride
of
the
regular
army
officer
and
i
decided
to
seek
elsewhere
for
permission
accordingly
i
wrote
to
president
roosevelt
that
here
was
an
old
indian
who
had
been
held
a
prisoner
of
war
for
twenty
years
and
had
never
been
given
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
and
asked
that
geronimo
be
granted
permission
to
tell
for
publication
in
his
own
way
the
story
of
his
life
and
that
he
be
guaranteed
that
the
publication
of
his
story
would
not
affect
unfavorably
the
apache
prisoners
of
war
by
return
mail
i
received
word
that
the
authority
had
been
granted
in
a
few
days
i
received
word
from
fort
sill
that
the
president
had
ordered
the
officer
in
charge
to
grant
permission
as
requested
an
interview
was
requested
that
i
might
receive
the
instructions
of
the
war

i
went
to

early
in

i
secured
the
services
of
an
educated
indian
asa
deklugie
son
of
whoa
chief
of
the
nedni
apaches
as
interpreter
and
the
work
of
compiling
the
book
began
geronimo
refused
to
talk
when
a
stenographer
was
present
or
to
wait
for
corrections
or
questions
when
telling
the
story
each
day
he
had
in
mind
what
he
would
tell
and
told
it
in
a
very
clear
brief
manner
he
might
prefer
to
talk
at
his
own
tepee
at
asa
deklugie
house
in
some
mountain
dell
or
as
he
rode
in
a
swinging
gallop
across
the
prairie
wherever
his
fancy
led
him
there
he
told
whatever
he
wished
to
tell
and
no
more
on
the
day
that
he
first
gave
any
portion
of
his
autobiography
he
would
not
be
questioned
about
any
details
nor
would
he
add
another
word
but
simply
said
write
what
i
have
spoken
and
left
us
to
remember
and
write
the
story
without
one
bit
of
assistance
he
would
agree
however
to
come
on
another
day
to
my
study
or
any
place
designated
by
me
and
listen
to
the
reproduction
in
apache
of
what
had
been
told
and
at
such
times
would
answer
all
questions
or
add
information
wherever
he
could
be
convinced
that
it
was
necessary
he
soon
became
so
tired
of
book
making
that
he
would
have
abandoned
the
task
but
for
the
fact
that
he
had
agreed
to
tell
the
complete
story
when
he
once
gives
his
word
nothing
will
turn
him
from
fulfilling
his
promise
a
very
striking
illustration
of
this
was
furnished
by
him
early
in
january
he
had
agreed
to
come
to
my
study
on
a
certain
date
but
at
the
appointed
hour
the
interpreter
came
alone
and
said
that
geronimo
was
very
sick
with
cold
and
fever
he
had
come
to
tell
me
that
we
must
appoint
another
date
as
he
feared
the
old
warrior
had
an
attack
of
pneumonia
it
was
a
cold
day
and
the
interpreter
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
grate
to
warm
himself
after
the
exposure
of
the
long
ride
just
as
he
was
seating
himself
he
looked
out
of
the
window
then
rose
quickly
and
without
speaking
pointed
to
a
rapidly
moving
object
coming
our
way
in
a
moment
i
recognized
the
old
chief
riding
furiously
evidently
trying
to
arrive
as
soon
as
the
interpreter
did
his
horse
flecked
with
foam
and
reeling
from
exhaustion
dismounting
he
came
in
and
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
promised
to
come
i
am
here
i
explained
to
him
that
i
had
not
expected
him
to
come
on
such
a
stormy
day
and
that
in
his
physical
condition
he
must
not
try
to
work
he
stood
for
some
time
and
then
without
speaking
left
the
room
remounted
his
tired
pony
and
with
bowed
head
faced
ten
long
miles
of
cold
north
wind
he
had
kept
his
promise
when
he
had
finished
his
story
i
submitted
the
manuscript
to
major
charles
taylor
eighteenth
cavalry
commandant
fort
sill
oklahoma
who
gave
me
some
valuable
suggestions
as
to
additional
related
information
which
i
asked
geronimo
to
give
in
most
cases
the
old
chief
gave
the
desired
information
but
in
some
instances
he
refused
stating
his
reasons
for
so
doing
when
the
added
information
had
been
incorporated
i
submitted
the
manuscript
to
president
roosevelt
from
whose
letter
i
quote
this
is
a
very
interesting
volume
which
you
have
in
manuscript
but
i
would
advise
that
you
disclaim
responsibility
in
all
cases
where
the
reputation
of
an
individual
is
assailed
in
accordance
with
that
suggestion
i
have
appended
notes
throughout
the
book
disclaiming
responsibility
for
adverse
criticisms
of
any
persons
mentioned
by
geronimo
on
june
i
transmitted
the
complete
manuscript
to
the
war
department
the
following
quotation
is
from
the
letter
of
transmission
in

with
endorsement
number
eight
of
the
submitted
to
me
by
the
commanding
officer
of
fort
sill
which
endorsement
constituted
the
instructions
of
the
department
i
submit
herewith
manuscript
of
the
autobiography
of
geronimo
the
manuscript
has
been
submitted
to
the
president
and
at
his
suggestion
i
have
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for
the
criticisms
made
by
geronimo
of
individuals
mentioned
six
weeks
after
the
manuscript
was
forwarded
thomas
barry
brigadier
general
assistant
to
the
chief
of
staff
sent
to
the
president
the
following
memorandum
for
the
secretary
of
war
subject
manuscript
of
the
autobiography
of
geronimo
the
paper
herewith
which
was
referred
to
this
office
on
july
with
instructions
to
report
as
to
whether
there
is
anything
objectionable
in
it
is
returned
the
manuscript
is
an
interesting
autobiography
of
a
notable
indian
made
by
himself
there
are
a
number
of
passages
which
from
the
departmental
point
of
view
are
decidedly
objectionable
these
are
found
on
pages
and
and
are
indicated
by
marginal
lines
in
red
the
entire
manuscript
appears
in
a
way
important
as
showing
the
indian
side
of
a
prolonged
controversy
but
it
is
believed
that
the
document
either
in
whole
or
in
part
should
not
receive
the
approval
of
the
war
department
the
memorandum
is
published
that
the
objections
of
the
war
department
may
be
made
known
to
the
public
the
objection
is
raised
to
the
mention
on
pages
and
of
the
manuscript
of
an
attack
upon
indians
in
a
tent
at
apache
pass
or
bowie
by
soldiers
the
statement
of
geronimo
is
however
substantially
confirmed
by
hughes
editor
of
tucson
arizona
on
pages
ninety
and
of
the
manuscript
geronimo
criticised
general
crook
this
criticism
is
simply
geronimo
private
opinion
of
general
crook
we
deem
it
a
personal
matter
and
leave
it
without
comment
as
it
in
no
way
concerns
the
history
of
the
apaches
on
page
of
the
manuscript
geronimo
accuses
general
miles
of
bad
faith
of
course
general
miles
made
the
treaty
with
the
apaches
but
we
know
very
well
that
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
way
the
government
subsequently
treated
the
prisoners
of
war
however
geronimo
can
not
understand
this
and
fixes
upon
general
miles
the
blame
for
what
he
calls
unjust
treatment
one
could
not
expect
the
department
of
war
to
approve
adverse
criticisms
of
its
own
acts
but
it
is
especially
gratifying
that
such
a
liberal
view
has
been
taken
of
these
criticisms
and
also
that
such
a
frank
statement
of
the
merits
of
the
autobiography
is
submitted
in
the
memorandum
of
course
neither
the
president
nor
the
war
department
is
in
any
way
responsible
for
what
geronimo
says
he
has
simply
been
granted
the
opportunity
to
state
his
own
case
as
he
sees
it
the
fact
that
geronimo
has
told
the
story
in
his
own
way
is
doubtless
the
only
excuse
necessary
to
offer
for
the
many
unconventional
features
of
this
work
part
i
the
apaches
geronimo
chapter
i
origin
of
the
apache
indians
in
the
beginning
the
world
was
covered
with
darkness
there
was
no
sun
no
day
the
perpetual
night
had
no
moon
or
stars
there
were
however
all
manner
of
beasts
and
birds
among
the
beasts
were
many
hideous
nameless
monsters
as
well
as
dragons
lions
tigers
wolves
foxes
beavers
rabbits
squirrels
rats
mice
and
all
manner
of
creeping
things
such
as
lizards
and
serpents
mankind
could
not
prosper
under
such
conditions
for
the
beasts
and
serpents
destroyed
all
human
offspring
all
creatures
had
the
power
of
speech
and
were
gifted
with
reason
there
were
two
tribes
of
creatures
the
birds
or
the
feathered
tribe
and
the
beasts
the
former
were
organized
under
their
chief
the
eagle
these
tribes
often
held
councils
and
the
birds
wanted
light
admitted
this
the
beasts
repeatedly
refused
to
do
finally
the
birds
made
war
against
the
beasts
the
beasts
were
armed
with
clubs
but
the
eagle
had
taught
his
tribe
to
use
bows
and
arrows
the
serpents
were
so
wise
that
they
could
not
all
be
killed
one
took
refuge
in
a
perpendicular
cliff
of
a
mountain
in
arizona
and
his
eye
changed
into
a
brilliant
stone
may
be
seen
in
that
rock
to
this
day
the
bears
when
killed
would
each
be
changed
into
several
other
bears
so
that
the
more
bears
the
feathered
tribe
killed
the
more
there
were
the
dragon
could
not
be
killed
either
for
he
was
covered
with
four
coats
of
horny
scales
and
the
arrows
would
not
penetrate
these
one
of
the
most
hideous
vile
monsters
nameless
was
proof
against
arrows
so
the
eagle
flew
high
up
in
the
air
with
a
round
white
stone
and
let
it
fall
on
this
monster
head
killing
him
instantly
this
was
such
a
good
service
that
the
stone
was
called
sacred
a
symbol
of
this
stone
is
used
in
the
tribal
game
of
kah
they
fought
for
many
days
but
at
last
the
birds
won
the
victory
after
this
war
was
over
although
some
evil
beasts
remained
the
birds
were
able
to
control
the
councils
and
light
was
admitted
then
mankind
could
live
and
prosper
the
eagle
was
chief
in
this
good
fight
therefore
his
feathers
were
worn
by
man
as
emblems
of
wisdom
justice
and
power
among
the
few
human
beings
that
were
yet
alive
was
a
woman
who
had
been
blessed
with
many
children
but
these
had
always
been
destroyed
by
the
beasts
if
by
any
means
she
succeeded
in
eluding
the
others
the
dragon
who
was
very
wise
and
very
evil
would
come
himself
and
eat
her
babes
after
many
years
a
son
of
the
rainstorm
was
born
to
her
and
she
dug
for
him
a
deep
cave
the
entrance
to
this
cave
she
closed
and
over
the
spot
built
a
camp
fire
this
concealed
the
babe
hiding
place
and
kept
him
warm
every
day
she
would
remove
the
fire
and
descend
into
the
cave
where
the
child
bed
was
to
nurse
him
then
she
would
return
and
rebuild
the
camp
fire
frequently
the
dragon
would
come
and
question
her
but
she
would
say
i
have
no
more
children
you
have
eaten
all
of
them
when
the
child
was
larger
he
would
not
always
stay
in
the
cave
for
he
sometimes
wanted
to
run
and
play
once
the
dragon
saw
his
tracks
now
this
perplexed
and
enraged
the
old
dragon
for
he
could
not
find
the
hiding
place
of
the
boy
but
he
said
that
he
would
destroy
the
mother
if
she
did
not
reveal
the
child
hiding
place
the
poor
mother
was
very
much
troubled
she
could
not
give
up
her
child
but
she
knew
the
power
and
cunning
of
the
dragon
therefore
she
lived
in
constant
fear
soon
after
this
the
boy
said
that
he
wished
to
go
hunting
the
mother
would
not
give
her
consent
she
told
him
of
the
dragon
the
wolves
and
the
serpents
but
he
said
i
go
at
the
boy
request
his
uncle
who
was
the
only
man
then
living
made
a
little
bow
and
some
arrows
for
him
and
the
two
went
hunting
the
next
day
they
trailed
the
deer
far
up
the
mountain
and
finally
the
boy
killed
a
buck
his
uncle
showed
him
how
to
dress
the
deer
and
broil
the
meat
they
broiled
two
hind
quarters
one
for
the
child
and
one
for
his
uncle
when
the
meat
was
done
they
placed
it
on
some
bushes
to
cool
just
then
the
huge
form
of
the
dragon
appeared
the
child
was
not
afraid
but
his
uncle
was
so
dumb
with
fright
that
he
did
not
speak
or
move
the
dragon
took
the
boy
parcel
of
meat
and
went
aside
with
it
he
placed
the
meat
on
another
bush
and
seated
himself
beside
it
then
he
said
this
is
the
child
i
have
been
seeking
boy
you
are
nice
and
fat
so
when
i
have
eaten
this
venison
i
shall
eat
you
the
boy
said
no
you
shall
not
eat
me
and
you
shall
not
eat
that
meat
so
he
walked
over
to
where
the
dragon
sat
and
took
the
meat
back
to
his
own
seat
the
dragon
said
i
like
your
courage
but
you
are
foolish
what
do
you
think
you
could
do
well
said
the
boy
i
can
do
enough
to
protect
myself
as
you
may
find
out
then
the
dragon
took
the
meat
again
and
then
the
boy
retook
it
four
times
in
all
the
dragon
took
the
meat
and
after
the
fourth
time
the
boy
replaced
the
meat
he
said
dragon
will
you
fight
me
the
dragon
said
yes
in
whatever
way
you
like
the
boy
said
i
will
stand
one
hundred
paces
distant
from
you
and
you
may
have
four
shots
at
me
with
your
bow
and
arrows
provided
that
you
will
then
exchange
places
with
me
and
give
me
four
shots
good
said
the
dragon
stand
up
illustration
dressed
as
in
days
of
old
then
the
dragon
took
his
bow
which
was
made
of
a
large
pine
tree
he
took
four
arrows
from
his
quiver
they
were
made
of
young
pine
tree
saplings
and
each
arrow
was
twenty
feet
in
length
he
took
deliberate
aim
but
just
as
the
arrow
left
the
bow
the
boy
made
a
peculiar
sound
and
leaped
into
the
air
immediately
the
arrow
was
shivered
into
a
thousand
splinters
and
the
boy
was
seen
standing
on
the
top
of
a
bright
rainbow
over
the
spot
where
the
dragon
aim
had
been
directed
soon
the
rainbow
was
gone
and
the
boy
was
standing
on
the
ground
again
four
times
this
was
repeated
then
the
boy
said
dragon
stand
here
it
is
my
time
to
shoot
the
dragon
said
all
right
your
little
arrows
can
not
pierce
my
first
coat
of
horn
and
i
have
three
other
coats
shoot
away
the
boy
shot
an
arrow
striking
the
dragon
just
over
the
heart
and
one
coat
of
the
great
horny
scales
fell
to
the
ground
the
next
shot
another
coat
and
then
another
and
the
dragon
heart
was
exposed
then
the
dragon
trembled
but
could
not
move
before
the
fourth
arrow
was
shot
the
boy
said
uncle
you
are
dumb
with
fear
you
have
not
moved
come
here
or
the
dragon
will
fall
on
you
his
uncle
ran
toward
him
then
he
sped
the
fourth
arrow
with
true
aim
and
it
pierced
the
dragon
heart
with
a
tremendous
roar
the
dragon
rolled
down
the
mountain
side
down
four
precipices
into
a
cañon
below
immediately
storm
clouds
swept
the
mountains
lightning
flashed
thunder
rolled
and
the
rain
poured
when
the
rainstorm
had
passed
far
down
in
the
cañon
below
they
could
see
fragments
of
the
huge
body
of
the
dragon
lying
among
the
rocks
and
the
bones
of
this
dragon
may
still
be
found
there
this
boy

was
apache
usen
taught
him
how
to
prepare
herbs
for
medicine
how
to
hunt
and
how
to
fight
he
was
the
first
chief
of

as
the
sign
of
justice
wisdom
and
power

usen

the
apache
word

we
asked
him
for
help

were

on
the
best
of
terms
with

tribe
yet
we
seldom
had
any
war
with
them
i
knew
their
chief
personally
and
i
considered
him
a
good
warrior
their
range
was
next
to
that
of
the
navajo
indians
who
were
not
of
the
same
blood
as
the
apaches
we
held
councils
with
all
apache
tribes

never
with
the
navajo
indians

we
traded
with
them
and
sometimes
visited

had

chiefs
within
my
time

were

lies
around
the
headwaters

river
i
was
reared
this

was
our
fatherland

our
wigwams
were
hidden
the

contained
our
fields
the
boundless
prairies
stretching
away
on
every
side
were
our
pastures
the
rocky
caverns
were
our

people
taught
me
of
the

the
moon

stars
the
clouds
and
storms
she
also
taught
me
to
kneel
and
pray
to
usen
for
strength
health
wisdom
and
protection
we
never
prayed
against
any
person
but
if
we
had
aught
against
any
individual
we
ourselves
took
vengeance
we
were
taught

sought
the

a
kind

our

worked

field
sometimes
we
played
that
we
were
warriors
we
would
practice
stealing
upon
some
object
that
represented
an
enemy
and
in
our
childish
imitation
often
perform
the
feats
of
war

could
find
us
and
often
when
thus
concealed
go
to
sleep
and
perhaps
remain
hidden
for
many
hours
when
we
were
old
enough
to
be
of
real
service
we
went
to
the
field
with
our
parents
not
to
play
but
to
toil
when
the
crops
were
to
be
planted
we
broke
the
ground
with
wooden
hoes
we
planted
the
corn
in
straight
rows
the
beans
among
the
corn
and
the
melons
and
pumpkins
in
irregular
order
over
the
field
we
cultivated
these
crops
as
there
was
need
our
field
usually
contained
about
two
acres
of
ground
the
fields
were
never
fenced
it
was
common
for
many
families
to
cultivate
land
in
the
same
valley
and
share
the
burden
of
protecting
the
growing
crops
from
destruction
by
the
ponies
of
the
tribe
or
by
deer
and
other
wild
animals
melons
were
gathered
as
they
were
consumed
in
the
autumn
pumpkins
and
beans
were
gathered
and
placed
in
bags
or
baskets
ears
of
corn
were
tied
together
by
the
husks
and
then
the
harvest
was
carried
on
the
backs
of
ponies
up
to
our
homes
here
the
corn
was
shelled
and
all
the
harvest
stored
away
in
caves
or
other
secluded
places
to
be
used
in
winter
we
never
fed
corn
to
our
ponies
but
if
we
kept
them
up
in
the
winter
time
we
gave
them
fodder
to
eat
we
had
no
cattle
or
other
domestic
animals
except
our
dogs
and
ponies
we
did
not
cultivate
tobacco
but
found
it
growing
wild
this
we
cut
and
cured
in
autumn
but
if
the
supply
ran
out
the
leaves
from
the
stalks
left
standing
served
our
purpose
all
indians
smoked
men
and
women
no
boy
was
allowed
to
smoke
until
he
had
hunted
alone
and
killed
large
game
wolves
and
bears
unmarried
women
were
not
prohibited
from
smoking
but
were
considered
immodest
if
they
did
so
nearly
all
matrons
smoked
besides
grinding
the
corn
by
hand
with
stone
mortars
and
pestles
for
bread
we
sometimes
crushed
it
and
soaked
it
and
after
it
had
fermented
made
from
this
juice
a
which
had
the
power
of
intoxication
and
was
very
highly
prized
by
the
indians
this
work
was
done
by
the
squaws
and
children
when
berries
or
nuts
were
to
be
gathered
the
small
children
and
the
squaws
would
go
in
parties
to
hunt
them
and
sometimes
stay
all
day
when
they
went
any
great
distance
from
camp
they
took
ponies
to
carry
the
baskets
i
frequently
went
with
these
parties
and
upon
one
of
these
excursions
a
woman
named
got
lost
from
the
party
and
was
riding
her
pony
through
a
thicket
in
search
of
her
friends
her
little
dog
was
following
as
she
slowly
made
her
way
through
the
thick
underbrush
and
pine
trees
all
at
once
a
grizzly
bear
rose
in
her
path
and
attacked
the
pony
she
jumped
off
and
her
pony
escaped
but
the
bear
attacked
her
so
she
fought
him
the
best
she
could
with
her
knife
her
little
dog
by
snapping
at
the
bear
heels
and
detracting
his
attention
from
the
woman
enabled
her
for
some
time
to
keep
pretty
well
out
of
his
reach
finally
the
grizzly
struck
her
over
the
head
tearing
off
almost
her
whole
scalp
she
fell
but
did
not
lose
consciousness
and
while
prostrate
struck
him
four
good
licks
with
her
knife
and
he
retreated
after
he
had
gone
she
replaced
her
torn
scalp
and
bound
it
up
as
best
she
could
then
she
turned
deathly
sick
and
had
to
lie
down
that
night
her
pony
came
into
camp
with
his
load
of
nuts
and
berries
but
no
rider
the
indians
hunted
for
her
but
did
not
find
her
until
the
second
day
they
carried
her
home
and
under
the
treatment
of
their
medicine
men
all
her
wounds
were
healed

the
indians
knew
what
herbs
to
use
for
medicine
how
to
prepare
them
and
how
to
give
the
medicine
this
they
had
been
taught
by
usen
in
the
beginning
and
each
succeeding
generation
had
men
who
were
skilled
in
the
art
of
healing
in
gathering
the
herbs
in
preparing
them
and
in
administering
the
medicine
as
much
faith
was
held
in
prayer
as
in
the
actual
effect
of
the
medicine
usually
about
eight
persons
worked
together
in
making
medicine
and
there
were
forms
of
prayer
and
incantations
to
attend
each
stage
of
the
process
four
attended
to
the
incantations
and
four
to
the
preparation
of
the
herbs
some
of
the
indians
were
skilled
in
cutting
out
bullets
arrow
heads
and
other
missiles
with
which
warriors
were
wounded
i
myself
have
done
much
of
this
using
a
common

butcher
knife
small
children
wore
very
little
clothing
in
winter
and
none
in

wore
a
primitive
skirt
which
consisted
of
a
piece
of
cotton
cloth
fastened
about
the
waist
and
extending
to
the
knees
men
wore
breech
cloths
and
moccasins
in
winter
they
had
shirts
and
leggings
in
addition
frequently
when
the
tribe
was
in
camp
a
number
of
boys
and
girls
by
agreement
would
steal
away
and
meet
at
a
place
several
miles
distant
where
they
could
play
all
day
free
from
tasks
they
were
never
punished
for
these
frolics

if
their
hiding

were
discovered
they
were
ridiculed

chapter
iv
tribal
amusements
manners
and
customs
to
celebrate
each
noted
event
a
feast
and
dance
would
be
given
perhaps
only
our
own
people
perhaps
neighboring
tribes
would
be
invited
these
festivities
usually
lasted
for
about
four
days
by
day
we
feasted
by
night
under
the
direction
of
some
chief
we
danced
the
music
for
our
dance
was
singing
led
by
the
warriors
and
accompanied
by
beating
the
esadadedne
no
words
were
sung
only
the
tones
when
the
feasting
and
dancing
were
over
we
would
have
horse
races
foot
races
wrestling
jumping
and
all
sorts
of
games
gambling
among
these
games
the
most
noted
was
the
tribal
game
of
kah
foot
it
is
played
as
follows
four
moccasins
are
placed
about
four
feet
apart
in
holes
in
the
ground
dug
in
a
row
on
one
side
of
the
camp
and
on
the
opposite
side
a
similar
parallel
row
at
night
a
camp
fire
is
started
between
these
two
rows
of
moccasins
and
the
players
are
arranged
on
sides
one
or
any
number
on
each
side
the
score
is
kept
by
a
bundle
of
sticks
from
which
each
side
takes
a
stick
for
every
point
won
first
one
side
takes
the
bone
a
symbol
of
the
white
rock
used
by
the
eagle
in
slaying
the
nameless
monster
see
chapter
i
puts
up
blankets
between
the
four
moccasins
and
the
fire
so
that
the
opposing
team
can
not
observe
their
movements
and
then
begin
to
sing
the
legends
of
creation
the
side
having
the
bone
represents
the
feathered
tribe
the
opposite
side
represents
the
beasts
the
players
representing
the
birds
do
all
the
singing
and
while
singing
hide
the
bone
in
one
of
the
moccasins
then
the
blankets
are
thrown
down
they
continue
to
sing
but
as
soon
as
the
blankets
are
thrown
down
the
chosen
player
from
the
opposing
team
armed
with
a
war
club
comes
to
their
side
of
the
camp
fire
and
with
his
club
strikes
the
moccasin
in
which
he
thinks
the
bone
is
hidden
if
he
strikes
the
right
moccasin
his
side
gets
the
bone
and
in
turn
represents
the
birds
while
the
opposing
team
must
keep
quiet
and
guess
in
turn
there
are
only
four
plays
three
that
lose
and
one
that
wins
when
all
the
sticks
are
gone
from
the
bundle
the
side
having
the
largest
number
of
sticks
is
counted
winner
this
game
is
seldom
played
except
as
a
gambling
game
but
for
that
purpose
it
is
the
most
popular
game
known
to
the
tribe
usually
the
game
lasts
four
or
five
hours
it
is
never
played
in
daytime
after
the
games
are
all
finished
the
visitors
say
we
are
satisfied
and
the
camp
is
broken
up
i
was
always
glad
when
the
dances
and
feasts
were
announced
so
were
all
the
other
young
people
our
life
also
had
a
religious
side
we
had
no
churches
no
religious
organizations
no
sabbath
day
no
holidays
and
yet
we
worshiped
sometimes
the
whole
tribe
would
assemble
to
sing
and
pray
sometimes
a
smaller
number
perhaps
only
two
or
three
the
songs
had
a
few
words
but
were
not
formal
the
singer
would
occasionally
put
in
such
words
as
he
wished
instead
of
the
usual
tone
sound
sometimes
we
prayed
in
silence
sometimes
each
one
prayed
aloud
sometimes
an
aged
person
prayed
for
all
of
us
at
other
times
one
would
rise
and
speak
to
us
of
our
duties
to
each
other
and
to
usen
our
services
were
short
when
disease
or
pestilence
abounded
we
were
assembled
and
questioned
by
our
leaders
to
ascertain
what
evil
we
had
done
and
how
usen
could
be
satisfied
sometimes
sacrifice
was
deemed
necessary
sometimes
the
offending
one
was
punished
if
an
apache
had
allowed
his
aged
parents
to
suffer
for
food
or
shelter
if
he
had
neglected
or
abused
the
sick
if
he
had
profaned
our
religion
or
had
been
unfaithful
he
might
be
banished
from
the
tribe
the
apaches
had
no
prisons
as
white
men
have
instead
of
sending
their
criminals
into
prison
they
sent
them
out
of
their
tribe
these
faithless
cruel
lazy
or
cowardly
members
of
the
tribe
were
excluded
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
join
any
other
tribe
neither
could
they
have
any
protection
from
our
unwritten
tribal
laws
frequently
these
outlaw
indians
banded
together
and
committed
depredations
which
were
charged
against
the
regular
tribe
however
the
life
of
an
outlaw
indian
was
a
hard
lot
and
their
bands
never
became
very
large
besides
these
bands
frequently
provoked
the
wrath
of
the
tribe
and
secured
their
own
destruction
illustration
the
conquered
weapon
when
i
was
about
eight
or
ten
years
old
i
began
to
follow
the
chase
and
to
me
this
was
never
work
out
on
the
prairies
which
ran
up
to
our
mountain
homes
wandered
herds
of
deer
antelope
elk
and
buffalo
to
be
slaughtered
when
we
needed
them
usually
we
hunted
buffalo
on
horseback
killing
them
with
arrows
and
spears
their
skins
were
used
to
make
tepees
and
bedding
their
flesh
to
eat
it
required
more
skill
to
hunt
the
deer
than
any
other
animal
we
never
tried
to
approach
a
deer
except
against
the
wind
frequently
we
would
spend
hours
in
stealing
upon
grazing
deer
if
they
were
in
the
open
we
would
crawl
long
distances
on
the
ground
keeping
a
weed
or
brush
before
us
so
that
our
approach
would
not
be
noticed
often
we
could
kill
several
out
of
one
herd
before
the
others
would
run
away
their
flesh
was
dried
and
packed
in
vessels
and
would
keep
in
this
condition
for
many
months
the
hide
of
the
deer
was
soaked
in
water
and
ashes
and
the
hair
removed
and
then
the
process
of
tanning
continued
until
the
buckskin
was
soft
and
pliable
perhaps
no
other
animal
was
more
valuable
to
us
than
the
deer
in
the
forests
and
along
the
streams
were
many
wild
turkeys
these
we
would
drive
to
the
plains
then
slowly
ride
up
toward
them
until
they
were
almost
tired
out
when
they
began
to
drop
and
hide
we
would
ride
in
upon
them
and
by
swinging
from
the
side
of
our
horses
catch
them
if
one
started
to
fly
we
would
ride
swiftly
under
him
and
kill
him
with
a
short
stick
or
hunting
club
in
this
way
we
could
usually
get
as
many
wild
turkeys
as
we
could
carry
home
on
a
horse
there
were
many
rabbits
in
our
range
and
we
also
hunted
them
on
horseback
our
horses
were
trained
to
follow
the
rabbit
at
full
speed
and
as
they
approached
them
we
would
swing
from
one
side
of
the
horse
and
strike
the
rabbit
with
our
hunting
club
if
he
was
too
far
away
we
would
throw
the
stick
and
kill
him
this
was
great
sport
when
we
were
boys
but
as
warriors
we
seldom
hunted
small
game
there
were
many
fish
in
the
streams
but
as
we
did
not
eat
them
we
did
not
try
to
catch
or
kill
them
small
boys
sometimes
threw
stones
at
them
or
shot
at
them
for
practice
with
their
bows
and
arrows
usen
did
not
intend
snakes
frogs
or
fishes
to
be
eaten
i
have
never
eaten
of
them
there
were
many
eagles
in
the
mountains
these
we
hunted
for
their
feathers
it
required
great
skill
to
steal
upon
an
eagle
for
besides
having
sharp
eyes
he
is
wise
and
never
stops
at
any
place
where
he
does
not
have
a
good
view
of
the
surrounding
country
i
have
killed
many
bears
with
a
spear
but
was
never
injured
in
a
fight
with
one
i
have
killed
several
mountain
lions
with
arrows
and
one
with
a
spear
both
bears
and
mountain
lions
are
good
for
food
and
valuable
for
their
skin
when
we
killed
them
we
carried
them
home
on
our
horses
we
often
made
quivers
for
our
arrows
from
the
skin
of
the
mountain
lion
these
were
very
pretty
and
very
durable
during
my
minority
we
had
never
seen
a
missionary
or
a
priest
we
had
never
seen
a
white
man
thus
quietly
lived
the
apaches
footnote
the
apaches
recognized
no
duties
to
any
man
outside
their
tribe
it
was
no
sin
to
kill
enemies
or
to
rob
them
however
if
they
accepted
any
favor
from
a
stranger
or
allowed
him
to
share
their
comforts
in
any
way
he
became
by
adoption
related
to
the
tribe
and
they
must
recognize
their
duty
to
him
chapter
v
the
family
my
grandfather
maco
had
been
our
chief
i
never
saw
him
but
my
father
often
told
me
of
the
great
size
strength
and
sagacity
of
this
old
warrior
their
principal
wars
had
been
with
the
mexicans
they
had
some
wars
with
other
tribes
of
indians
also
but
were
seldom
at
peace
for
any
great
length
of
time
with
the
mexican
towns
maco
died
when
my
father
was
but
a
young
warrior
and
became
chief
of
the
bedonkohe
apaches
when
i
was
but
a
small
boy
my
father
died
after
having
been
sick
for
some
time
when
he
passed
away
carefully
the
watchers
closed
his
eyes
then
they
arrayed
him
in
his
best
clothes
painted
his
face
afresh
wrapped
a
rich
blanket
around
him
saddled
his
favorite
horse
bore
his
arms
in
front
of
him
and
led
his
horse
behind
repeating
in
wailing
tones
his
deeds
of
valor
as
they
carried
his
body
to
a
cave
in
the
mountain
then
they
slew
his
horses
and
we
gave
away
all
of
his
other
property
as
was
customary
in
our
tribe
after
which
his
body
was
deposited
in
the

he
lies
in
seclusion
and
the
winds
in

pines
sing
a
low
requiem
over
the
dead
warrior
after
my
father
death
i
assumed
the
care
of
my
mother
she
never
married
again
although
according
to
the
customs
of
our
tribe
she
might
have
done
so
immediately
after
his
death
usually
however
the
widow
who
has
children
remains
single
after
her
husband
death
for
two
or
three
years
but
the
widow
without
children
marries
again
immediately
after
a
warrior
death
his
widow
returns
to
her
people
and
may
be
given
away
or
sold
by
her
father
or
brothers
my
mother
chose
to
live
with
me
and
she
never
desired
to
marry
again
we
lived
near
our
old
home
and
i
supported
her
in
being
seventeen
years
of
age
i
was
admitted
to
the
council
of
the
warriors
then
i
was
very
happy
for
i
could
go
wherever
i
wanted
and
do
whatever
i
liked
i
had
not
been
under
the
control
of
any
individual
but
the
customs
of
our
tribe
prohibited
me
from
sharing
the
glories
of
the
warpath
until
the
council
admitted
me
when
opportunity
offered
after
this
i
could
go
on
the
warpath
with
my
tribe
this
would
be
glorious
i
hoped
soon
to
serve
my
people
in
battle
i
had
long
desired
to
fight
with
our
warriors
perhaps
the
greatest
joy
to
me
was
that
now
i
could
marry
the
fair
alope
daughter
of
she
was
a
slender
delicate
girl
but
we
had
been
lovers
for
a
long
time
so
as
soon
as
the
council
granted
me
these
privileges
i
went
to
see
her
father
concerning
our
marriage
perhaps
our
love
was
of
no
interest
to
him
perhaps
he
wanted
to
keep
alope
with
him
for
she
was
a
dutiful
daughter
at
any
rate
he
asked
many
ponies
for
her
i
made
no
reply
but
in
a
few
days
appeared
before
his
wigwam
with
the
herd
of
ponies
and
took
with
me
alope
this
was
all
the
marriage
ceremony
necessary
in
our
tribe
not
far
from
my
mother
tepee
i
had
made
for
us
a
new
home
the
tepee
was
made
of
buffalo
hides
and
in
it
were
many
bear
robes
lion
hides
and
other
trophies
of
the
chase
as
well
as
my
spears
bows
and
arrows
alope
had
made
many
little
decorations
of
beads
and
drawn
work
on
buckskin
which
she
placed
in
our
tepee
she
also
drew
many
pictures
on
the
walls
of
our
home
she
was
a
good
wife
but
she
was
never
strong
we
followed
the
traditions
of
our
fathers
and
were
happy
three
children
came
to
us
children
that
played
loitered
and
worked
as
i
had
done

although
his

it
is
also
shown
that

the

of
the
apaches
will
not
keep
any
of
the

of
a

their
unwritten

forbid
it

they
think

the
in
the
summer
of
being
at
peace
with
the
mexican
towns
as
well
as
with
all
the
neighboring
indian
tribes
we
went
south
into
old
mexico
to
trade
our
whole
tribe
bedonkohe
apaches
went
through
sonora
toward
casa
grande
our
destination
but
just
before
reaching
that
place
we
stopped
at
another
mexican
town
called
by
the
indians
here
we
stayed
for
several
days
camping
just
outside
the
city
every
day
we
would
go
into
town
to
trade
leaving
our
camp
under
the
protection
of
a
small
guard
so
that
our
arms
supplies
and
women
and
children
would
not
be
disturbed
during
our
absence
late
one
afternoon
when
returning
from
town
we
were
met
by
a
few
women
and
children
who
told
us
that
mexican
troops
from
some
other
town
had
attacked
our
camp
killed
all
the
warriors
of
the
guard
captured
all
our
ponies
secured
our
arms
destroyed
our
supplies
and
killed
many
of
our
women
and
children
quickly
we
separated
concealing
ourselves
as
best
we
could
until
nightfall
when
we
assembled
at
our
appointed
place
of
rendezvous
a
thicket
by
the
river
silently
we
stole
in
one
by
one
sentinels
were
placed
and
when
all
were
counted
i
found
that
my
aged
mother
my
young
wife
and
my
three
small
children
were
among
the
slain
there
were
no
lights
in
camp
so
without
being
noticed
i
silently
turned
away
and
stood
by
the
river
how
long
i
stood
there
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
saw
the
warriors
arranging
for
a
council
i
took
my
place
that
night
i
did
not
give
my
vote
for
or
against
any
measure
but
it
was
decided
that
as
there
were
only
eighty
warriors
left
and
as
we
were
without
arms
or
supplies
and
were
furthermore
surrounded
by
the
mexicans
far
inside
their
own
territory
we
could
not
hope
to
fight
successfully
so
our
chief
gave
the
order
to
start
at
once
in
perfect
silence
for
our
homes
in
arizona
leaving
the
dead
upon
the
field
i
stood
until
all
had
passed
hardly
knowing
what
i
would
do
i
had
no
weapon
nor
did
i
hardly
wish
to
fight
neither
did
i
contemplate
recovering
the
bodies
of
my
loved
ones
for
that
was
forbidden
i
did
not
pray
nor
did
i
resolve
to
do
anything
in
particular
for
i
had
no
purpose
left
i
finally
followed
the
tribe
silently
keeping
just
within
hearing
distance
of
the
soft
noise
of
the
feet
of
the
retreating
apaches
the
next
morning
some
of
the
indians
killed
a
small
amount
of
game
and
we
halted
long
enough
for
the
tribe
to
cook
and
eat
when
the
march
was
resumed
i
had
killed
no
game
and
did
not
eat
during
the
first
march
as
well
as
while
we
were
camped
at
this
place
i
spoke
to
no
one
and
no
one
spoke
to
me
there
was
nothing
to
say
for
two
days
and
three
nights
we
were
on
forced
marches
stopping
only
for
meals
then
we
made
a
camp
near
the
mexican
border
where
we
rested
two
days
here
i
took
some
food
and
talked
with
the
other
indians
who
had
lost
in
the
massacre
but
none
had
lost
as
i
had
for
i
had
lost
all
within
a
few
days
we
arrived
at
our
own
settlement
there
were
the
decorations
that
alope
had
made
and
there
were
the
playthings
of
our
little
ones
i
burned
them
all
even
our
tepee
i
also
burned
my
mother
tepee
and
destroyed
all
her
property
i
was
never
again
contented
in
our
quiet
home
true
i
could
visit
my
father
grave
but
i
had
vowed
vengeance
upon
the
mexican
troopers
who
had
wronged
me
and
whenever
i
came
near
his
grave
or
saw
anything
to
remind
me
of
former
happy
days
my
heart
would
ache
for
revenge
upon
mexico

as
soon
as
we
had
again
collected
some
arms
and
supplies
our
chief
called
a
council
and
found
that
all
our
warriors
were
willing
to
take
the
warpath
against
mexico
i
was
appointed
to
solicit
the
aid
of
other
tribes
in
this
war
when
i
went
to
the
chokonen
chiricahua
apaches
cochise
their
chief
called
a
council
at
early
dawn
silently
the
warriors
assembled
at
an
open
place
in
a
mountain
dell
and
took
their
seats
on
the
ground
arranged
in
rows
according
to
their
ranks
silently
they
sat
smoking
at
a
signal
from
the
chief
i
arose
and
presented
my
cause
as
follows
kinsman
you
have
heard
what
the
mexicans
have
recently
done
without
cause
you
are
my
relatives
uncles
cousins
brothers
we
are
men
the
same
as
the
mexicans
are
we
can
do
to
them
what
they
have
done
to
us
let
us
go
forward
and
trail
them
i
will
lead
you
to
their
city
we
will
attack
them
in
their
homes
i
will
fight
in
the
front
of
the
battle
i
only
ask
you
to
follow
me
to
avenge
this
wrong
done
by
these
mexicans
will
you
come
it
is
well
you
will
all
come
remember
the
rule
in
war
men
may
return
or
they
may
be
killed
if
any
of
these
young
men
are
killed
i
want
no
blame
from
their
kinsmen
for
they
themselves
have
chosen
to
go
if
i
am
killed
no
one
need
mourn
for
me
my
people
have
all
been
killed
in
that
country
and
i
too
will
die
if
need
be
i
returned
to
my
own
settlement
reported
this
success
to
my
chieftain
and
immediately
departed
to
the
southward
into
the
land
of
the
nedni
apaches
their
chief
whoa
heard
me
without
comment
but
he
immediately
issued
orders
for
a
council
and
when
all
were
ready
gave
a
sign
that
i
might
speak
i
addressed
them
as
i
had
addressed
the
chokonen
tribe
and
they
also
promised
to
help
us
it
was
in
the
summer
of
almost
a
year
from
the
date
of
the
massacre
of
kaskiyeh
that
these
three
tribes
were
assembled
on
the
mexican
border
to
go
upon
the
warpath
their
faces
were
painted
the
war
bands
fastened
upon
their
brows
their
long
ready
for
the
hand
and

of
the
warrior
who
could
overcome
them
their
families
had
been
hidden
away
in
a
mountain
rendezvous
near
the
mexican
border
with
these
families
a
guard
was
posted
and
a
number
of
places
of
rendezvous
designated
in
case
the
camp
should
be
disturbed
when
all
were
ready
the
chieftains
gave
command
to
go
forward
none
of
us
were
mounted
and
each
warrior
wore
moccasins
and
also
a
cloth
wrapped
about
his
loins
this
cloth
could
be
spread
over
him
when
he
slept
and
when
on
the
march
would
be
ample
protection
as
clothing
in
battle
if
the
fight
was
hard
we
did
not
wish
much
clothing
each
warrior
carried
three
days
rations
but
as
we
often
killed
game
while
on
the
march
we
seldom
were
without
food
we
traveled
in
three
divisions
the
bedonkohe
apaches
led
by
the
chokonen
apaches
by
cochise
and
the
nedni
apaches
by
whoa
however
there
was
no
regular
order
inside
the
separate
tribes
we
usually
marched
about
fourteen
hours
per
day
making
three
stops
for
meals
and
traveling
forty
to
miles
a
day
i
acted
as
guide
into
mexico
and
we
followed
the
river
courses
and
mountain
ranges
because
we
could
better
thereby
keep
our
movements
concealed
we
entered
sonora
and
went
southward
past
quitaco
nacozari
and
many
smaller
settlements

when
we
were
almost
at
arispe
we
camped
and
eight
men
rode
out
from
the
city
to
parley
with
us
these
we
captured
killed
and
scalped
this
was
to
draw
the
troops
from
the
city
and
the
next
day
they
came
the
skirmishing
lasted
all
day
without
a
general
engagement
but
just
at
night
we
captured
their
supply
train
so
we
had
plenty
of
provisions
and
some
more
guns
that
night
we
posted
sentinels
and
did
not
move
our
camp
but
rested
quietly
all
night
for
we
expected
heavy
work
the
next
day
early
the
next
morning
the
warriors
were
assembled
to
pray
not
for
help
but
that
they
might
have
health
and
avoid
ambush
or
deceptions
by
the
enemy
as
we
had
anticipated
about
ten
in
the
morning
the
whole
mexican
force
came
out
there
were
two
companies
of
cavalry
and
two
of
infantry
i
recognized
the
cavalry
as
the
soldiers
who
had
killed
my
people
at
kaskiyeh
this
i
told
to
the
chieftains
and
they
said
that
i
might
direct
the
battle
i
was
no
chief
and
never
had
been
but
because
i
had
been
more
deeply
wronged
than
others
this
honor
was
conferred
upon
me
and
i
resolved
to
prove
worthy
of
the
trust
i
arranged
the
indians
in
a
hollow
circle
near
the
river
and
the
mexicans
drew
their
infantry
up
in
two
lines
with
the
cavalry
in
reserve
we
were
in
the
timber
and
they
advanced
until
within
about
four
hundred
yards
when
they
halted
and
opened
fire
soon
i
led
a
charge
against
them
at
the
same
time
sending
some
braves
to
attack
their
rear
in
all
the
battle
i
thought
of
my
murdered
mother
wife
and
babies
of
my
father
grave
and
my
vow
of
vengeance
and
i
fought
with
fury
many
fell
by
my
hand
and
constantly
i
led
the
advance
many
braves
were
killed
the
battle
lasted
about
two
hours
at
the
last
four
indians
were
alone
in
the
center
of
the
field
myself
and
three
other
warriors
our
arrows
were
all
gone
our
spears
broken
off
in
the
bodies
of
dead
enemies
we
had
only
our
hands
and
knives
with
which
to
fight
but
all
who
had
stood
against
us
were
dead
then
two
armed
soldiers
came
upon
us
from
another
part
of
the
field
they
shot
down
two
of
our
men
and
we
the
remaining
two
fled
toward
our
own
warriors
my
companion
was
struck
down
by
a
saber
but
i
reached
our
warriors
seized
a
spear
and
turned
the
one
who
pursued
me
missed
his
aim
and
fell
by
my
spear
with
his
saber
i
met
the
trooper
who
had
killed
my
companion
and
we
grappled
and
fell
i
killed
him
with
my
knife
and
quickly
rose
over
his
body
brandishing
his
saber
seeking
for
other
troopers
to
kill
there
were
none
but
the
apaches
had
seen
over
the
bloody
field
covered
with
the
bodies
of
mexicans
rang
the
fierce
apache
still
covered
with
the
blood
of
my
enemies
still
holding
my
conquering
weapon
still
hot
with
the
joy
of
battle
victory
and
vengeance
i
was
surrounded
by
the
apache
braves
and
made
war
chief
of
all
the
apaches
then
i
gave
orders
for
scalping
the
slain
i
could
not
call
back
my
loved
ones
i
could
not
bring
back
the
dead
apaches
but
i
could
rejoice
in
this
revenge

had
avenged

tribe
and
went
on
the
warpath
we
were
on
foot
and
carried
three
days
rations
we
entered
mexico
on
the
north
line
of
sonora
and
followed
the
sierra
de
antunez
mountains
to
the
south
end
of
the
range
here
we
decided
to
attack
a
small
village
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
this
village
at
daylight
we
approached
from
the
mountains
five
horses
were
hitched
outside
we
advanced
cautiously
but
just
before
we
reached
the
horses
the
mexicans
opened
fire
from
the
houses
my
two
companions
were
killed
mexicans
swarmed
on
every
side
some
were
mounted
some
were
on
foot
and
all
seemed
to
be
armed
three
times
that
day
i
was
surrounded
but
i
kept
fighting
dodging
and
hiding
several
times
during
the
day
while
in
concealment
i
had
a
chance
to
take
deliberate
aim
at
some
mexican
who
gun
in
hand
was
looking
for
me
i
do
not
think
i
missed
my
aim
either
time
with
the
gathering
darkness
i
found
more
time
to
retreat
toward
arizona
but
the
mexicans
did
not
quit
the
chase
several
times
the
next
day
mounted
mexicans
tried
to
head
me
off
many
times
they
fired
on
me
but
i
had
no
more
arrows
so
i
depended
upon
running
and
hiding
although
i
was
very
tired
i
had
not
eaten
since
the
chase
began
nor
had
i
dared
to
stop
for
rest
the
second
night
i
got
clear
of
my
pursuers
but
i
never
slackened
my
pace
until
i
reached
our
home
in
arizona
i
came
into
our
camp
without
booty
without
my
companions
exhausted
but
not
discouraged
the
wives
and
children
of
my
two
dead
companions
were
cared
for
by
their
people
some
of
the
apaches
blamed
me
for
the
evil
result
of
the
expedition
but
i
said
nothing
having
failed
it
was
only
proper
that
i
should
remain
silent
but
my
feelings
toward
the
mexicans
did
not
change
i
still
hated
them
and
longed
for
revenge
i
never
ceased
to
plan
for
their
punishment
but
it
was
hard
to
get
the
other
warriors
to
listen
to
my
proposed
raids
in
a
few
months
after
this
last
adventure
i
persuaded
two
other
warriors
to
join
me
in
raiding
the
mexican
frontier
on
our
former
raid
we
had
gone
through
the
nedni
apaches
range
into
sonora
this
time
we
went
through
the
country
of
the
and
entered
the
sierra
madre
mountains
we
traveled
south
secured
more
rations
and
prepared
to
begin
our
raids
we
had
selected
a
village
near
the
mountains
which
we
intended
to
attack
at
daylight
while
asleep
that
night
mexican
scouts
discovered
our
camp
and
fired
on
us
killing
one
warrior
in
the
morning
we
observed
a
company
of
mexican
troops
coming
from
the
south
they
were
mounted
and
carried
supplies
for
a
long
journey
we
followed
their
trail
until
we
were
sure
that
they
were
headed
for
our
range
in
arizona
then
we
hurried
past
them
and
in
three
days
reached
our
own
settlement
we
arrived
at
noon
and
that
afternoon
about
three
these
mexican
troops
attacked
our
settlement
their
first
volley
killed
three
small
boys
many
of
the
warriors
of
our
tribe
were
away
from
home
but
the
few
of
us
who
were
in
camp
were
able
to
drive
the
troops
out
of
the
mountains
before
night
we
killed
eight
mexicans
and
lost
five
two
warriors
and
three
boys
the
mexicans
rode
due
south
in
full
retreat
four
warriors
were
detailed
to
follow
them
and
in
three
days
these
trailers
returned
saying
that
the
mexican
cavalry
had
left
arizona
going
southward
we
were
quite
sure
they
would
not
return
soon
soon
after
this
in
the
summer
of
i
was
again
able
to
take
the
warpath
against
the
mexicans
this
time
with
warriors
we
followed
the
trail
of
the
mexican
troops
last
mentioned
and
entered
the
sierra
de
sahuaripa
mountains
the
second
day
in
these
mountains
our
scouts
discovered
mounted
mexican
troops
there
was
only
one
company
of
cavalry
in
this
command
and
i
thought
that
by
properly
surprising
them
we
could
defeat
them
we
ambushed
the
trail
over
which
they
were
to
come
this
was
at
a
place
where
the
whole
company
must
pass
through
a
mountain
defile
we
reserved
fire
until
all
of
the
troops
had
passed
through
then
the
signal
was
given
the
mexican
troopers
seemingly
without
a
word
of
command
dismounted
and
placing
their
horses
on
the
outside
of
the
company
for
breastworks
made
a
good
fight
against
us
i
saw
that
we
could
not
dislodge
them
without
using
all
our
ammunition
so
i
led
a
charge
the
warriors
suddenly
pressed
in
from
all
sides
and
we
fought
hand
to
hand
during
this
encounter
i
raised
my
spear
to
kill
a
mexican
soldier
just
as
he
leveled
his
gun
at
me
i
was
advancing
rapidly
and
my
foot
slipping
in
a
pool
of
blood
i
fell
under
the
mexican
trooper
he
struck
me
over
the
head
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
knocking
me
senseless
just
at
that
instant
a
warrior
who
followed
in
my
footsteps
killed
the
mexican
with
a
spear
in
a
few
minutes
not
a
mexican
soldier
was
left
alive
when
the
apache
had
died
away
and
their
enemies
had
been
scalped
they
began
to
care
for
their
dead
and
wounded
i
was
found
lying
unconscious
where
i
had
fallen
they
bathed
my
head
in
cold
water
and
restored
me
to
consciousness
then
they
bound
up
my
wound
and
the
next
morning
although
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
suffering
from
a
severe
headache
i
was
able
to
march
on
the
return
to
arizona
i
did
not
fully
recover
for
months
and
i
still
wear
the
scar
given
me
by
that
musketeer
in
this
fight
we
had
lost
so
heavily
that
there
really
was
no
glory
in
our
victory
and
we
returned
to
arizona
no
one
seemed
to
want
to
go
on
the
warpath
again
that
year
in
the
summer
with
twelve
warriors
i
again
went
into
mexico
we
entered
chihuahua
and
followed
south
on
the
east
side
of
the
sierra
madre
mountains
four
days
journey
then
crossed
over
to
the
sierra
de
sahuaripa
range
not
far
east
of
casa
grande
here
we
rested
one
day
and
sent
out
scouts
to
reconnoiter
they
reported
pack
trains
camped
five
miles
west
of
us
the
next
morning
just
at
daybreak
as
these
drivers
were
starting
with
their
mule
pack
train
we
attacked
them
they
rode
away
for
their
lives
leaving
us
the
booty
the
mules
were
loaded
with
provisions
most
of
which
we
took
home
two
mules
were
loaded
with
or
bacon
this
we
threw
away
we
started
to
take
these
pack
trains
home
going
northward
through
sonora
but
when
near
casita
mexican
troops
overtook
us
it
was
at
daybreak
and
we
were
just
finishing
our
breakfast
we
had
no
idea
that
we
had
been
pursued
or
that
our
enemies
were
near
until
they
opened
fire
at
the
first
volley
a
bullet
struck
me
a
glancing
lick
just
at
the
lower
corner
of
the
left
eye
and
i
fell
unconscious
all
the
other
indians
fled
to
cover
the
mexicans
thinking
me
dead
started
in
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
indians
in
a
few
moments
i
regained
consciousness
and
had
started
at
full
speed
for
the
woods
when
another
company
coming
up
opened
fire
on
me
then
the
soldiers
who
had
been
chasing
the
other
indians
turned
and
i
stood
between
two
hostile
companies
but
i
did
not
stand
long
bullets
whistled
in
every
direction
and
at
close
range
to
me
one
inflicted
a
slight
flesh
wound
on
my
side
but
i
kept
running
dodging
and
fighting
until
i
got
clear
of
my
pursuers
i
climbed
up
a
steep
cañon
where
the
cavalry
could
not
follow
the
troopers
saw
me
but
did
not
dismount
and
try
to
follow
i
think
they
were
wise
not
to
come
on
it
had
been
understood
that
in
case
of
surprise
with
this
booty
our
place
of
rendezvous
should
be
the
santa
bita
mountains
in
arizona
we
did
not
reassemble
in
mexico
but
traveled
separately
and
in
three
days
we
were
encamped
in
our
place
of
rendezvous
from
this
place
we
returned
home
we
had
not
even
a
partial
victory
to
report
i
again
returned
wounded
but
i
was
not
yet
discouraged
again
i
was
blamed
by
our
people
and
again
i
had
no
reply
after
our
return
many
of
the
warriors
had
gone
on
a
hunt
and
some
of
them
had
gone
north
to
trade
for
blankets
from
the
navajo
indians
i
remained
at
home
trying
to
get
my
wounds
healed
one
morning
just
at
daybreak
when
the
squaws
were
lighting
the
camp
fires
to
prepare
breakfast
three
companies
of
mexican
troops
who
had
surrounded
our
settlement
in
the
night
opened
fire
there
was
no
time
for
fighting
men
women
and
children
fled
for
their
lives
many
women
and
children
and
a
few
warriors
were
killed
and
four
women
were
captured
my
left
eye
was
still
swollen
shut
but
with
the
other
i
saw
well
enough
to
hit
one
of
the
officers
with
an
arrow
and
then
make
good
my
escape
among
the
rocks
the
troopers
burned
our
tepees
and
took
our
arms
provisions
ponies
and
blankets
winter
was
at
hand
there
were
not
more
than
twenty
warriors
in
camp
at
this
time
and
only
a
few
of
us
had
secured
weapons
during
the
excitement
of
the
attack
a
few
warriors
followed
the
trail
of
the
troops
as
they
went
back
to
mexico
with
their
booty
but
were
unable
to
offer
battle
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
we
were
again
able
to
go
on
the
warpath
against
the
mexicans
the
four
women
who
were
captured
at
this
time
by
the
mexicans
were
taken
into
sonora
mexico
where
they
were
compelled
to
work
for
the
mexicans
after
some
years
they
escaped
to
the
mountains
and
started
to
find
our
tribe
they
had
knives
which
they
had
stolen
from
the
mexicans
but
they
had
no
other
weapons
they
had
no
blankets
so
at
night
they
would
make
a
little
tepee
by
cutting
brush
with
their
knives
and
setting
them
up
for
the
walls
the
top
was
covered
over
with
brush
in
this
temporary
tepee
they
would
all
sleep
one
night
when
their
camp
fire
was
low
they
heard
growling
just
outside
the
tepee
francisco
the
youngest
woman
of
the
party
about
seventeen
years
of
age
started
to
build
up
the
fire
when
a
mountain
lion
crashed
through
the
tepee
and
attacked
her
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
made
her
drop
her
knife
but
she
fought
as
best
she
could
with
her
hand
she
was
no
match
for
the
lion
however
her
left
shoulder
was
crushed
and
partly
torn
away
the
lion
kept
trying
to
catch
her
by
the
throat
this
she
prevented
with
her
hands
for
a
long
time
he
dragged
her
for
about
yards
then
she
found
her
strength
was
failing
her
from
loss
of
blood
and
she
called
to
the
other
women
for
help
the
lion
had
been
dragging
her
by
one
foot
and
she
had
been
catching
hold
of
his
legs
and
of
the
rocks
and
underbrush
to
delay
him
finally
he
stopped
and
stood
over
her
she
again
called
her
companions
and
they
attacked
him
with
their
knives
and
killed
him
then
they
dressed
her
wounds
and
nursed
her
in
the
mountains
for
about
a
month
when
she
was
again
able
to
walk
they
resumed
their
journey
and
reached
our
tribe

safety

we
went

on
the
west
side
of
the
sierra

mountains
for
five
days
then
in
the
night
crossed
over
to
the
southern
part
of
the
sierra
de

range
here
we
again
camped
to
watch
for
pack
trains
about
ten
next
morning
four
drivers
mounted
came
past
our
camp
with
a
train
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
they
rode
for
their
lives
leaving
us
the
booty
this
was
a
long
train
and
packed
with
blankets
calico
saddles
tinware
and
loaf
sugar
we
hurried
home
as
fast
as
we
could
with
these
provisions
and
on
our
return
while
passing
through
a
cañon
in
the
santa
catilina
range
of
mountains
in
arizona
met
a
white
man
driving
a
mule
pack
train
when
we
first
saw
him
he
had
already
seen
us
and
was
riding
at
full
tilt
up
the
cañon
we
examined
his
train
and
found
that
his
mules
were
all
loaded
with
cheese
we
put
them
in
with
the
other
train
and
resumed
our
journey
we
did
not
attempt
to
trail
the
driver
and
i
am
sure
he
did
not
try
to
follow
us
in
two
days
we
arrived
at
home
then
our
chief
assembled
the
tribe
we
gave
a
feast
divided
the
spoils
and
danced
all
night
some
of
the
pack
mules
were
killed
and
eaten
this
time
after
our
return
we
kept
out
scouts
so
that
we
would
know
if
mexican
troops
should
attempt
to
follow
us
on
the
third
day
our
scouts
came
into
camp
and
reported
mexican
cavalry
dismounted
and
approaching
our
settlement
all
our
warriors
were
in
camp
took
command
of
one
division
and
i
of
the
other
we
hoped
to
get
possession
of
their
horses
then
surround
the
troops
in
the
mountains
and
destroy
the
whole
company
this
we
were
unable
to
do
for
they
too
had
scouts
however
within
four
hours
after
we
started
we
had
killed
ten
troopers
with
the
loss
of
only
one
man
and
the
mexican
cavalry
was
in
full
retreat
followed
by
thirty
armed
apaches
who
gave
them
no
rest
until
they
were

and
concluded
to
make
an
attack
we
had
noticed
that
just
at
midday
no
one
seemed
to
be
stirring
so
we
planned
to
make
our
attack
at
the
noon
hour
the
next
day
we
stole
into
the
town
at
noon
we
had
no
guns
but
were
armed
with
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
when
the
was
given
to
open
the
attack
the
mexicans
fled
in
every
direction
not
one
of
them
made
any
attempt
to
fight
us
we
shot
some
arrows
at
the
retreating
mexicans
but
killed
only
one
soon
all
was
silent
in
the
town
and
no
mexicans
could
be
seen
when
we
discovered
that
all
the
mexicans
were
gone
we
looked
through
their
houses
and
saw
many
curious
things
these
mexicans
kept
many
more
kinds
of
property
than
the
apaches
did
many
of
the
things
we
saw
in
the
houses
we
could
not
understand
but
in
the
stores
we
saw
much
that
we
wanted
so
we
drove
in
a
herd
of
horses
and
mules
and
packed
as
much
provisions
and
supplies
as
we
could
on
them
then
we
formed
these
animals
into
a
pack
train
and
returned
safely
to
arizona
the
mexicans
did
not
even
trail
us
when
we
arrived
in
camp
we
called
the
tribe
together
and
feasted
all
day
we
gave
presents
to
everyone
that
night
the
dance
began
and
it
did
not
cease
until
noon
the
next
day
this
was
perhaps
the
most
successful
raid
ever
made
by
us
into
mexican
territory
i
do
not
know
the
value
of
the
booty
but
it
was
very
great
for
we
had
supplies
enough
to
last
our
whole
tribe
for
a
year
or
more
in
the
fall
of
twenty
warriors
were
willing
to
go
with
me
on
another
raid
into
mexico
these
were
all
chosen
men
well
armed
and
equipped
for
battle
as
usual
we
provided
for
the
safety
of
our
families
before
starting
on
this
raid
our
whole
tribe
scattered
and
then
reassembled
at
a
camp
about
forty
miles
from
the
former
place
in
this
way
it
would
be
hard
for
the
mexicans
to
trail
them
and
we
would
know
where
to
find
our
families
when
we
returned
moreover
if
any
hostile
indians
should
see
this
large
number
of
warriors
leaving
our
range
they
might
attack
our
camp
but
if
they
found
no
one
at
the
usual
place
their
raid
would
fail
we
went
south
through
the
chokonen
apaches
range
entered
sonora
mexico
at
a
point
directly
south
of
tombstone
arizona
and
went
into
hiding
in
the
sierra
de
antunez
mountains
we
attacked
several
settlements
in
the
neighborhood
and
secured
plenty
of
provisions
and
supplies
after
about
three
days
we
attacked
and
captured
a
mule
pack
train
at
a
place
called
by
the
indians
pontoco
it
is
situated
in
the
mountains
due
west
about
one
day
journey
from
arispe
there
were
three
drivers
with
this
train
one
was
killed
and
two
escaped
the
train
was
loaded
with
mescal
which
was
contained
in
bottles
held
in
wicker
baskets
as
soon
as
we
made
camp
the
indians
began
to
get
drunk
and
fight
each
other
i
too
drank
enough
mescal
to
feel
the
effect
of
it
but
i
was
not
drunk
i
ordered
the
fighting
stopped
but
the
order
was
disobeyed
soon
almost
a
general
fight
was
in
progress
i
tried
to
place
a
guard
out
around
our
camp
but
all
were
drunk
and
refused
to
serve
i
expected
an
attack
from
mexican
troops
at
any
moment
and
really
it
was
a
serious
matter
for
me
for
being
in
command
i
would
be
held
responsible
for
any
ill
luck
attending
the
expedition
finally
the
camp
became
comparatively
still
for
the
indians
were
too
drunk
to
walk
or
even
to
fight
while
they
were
in
this
stupor
i
poured
out
all
the
mescal
then
i
put
out
all
the
fires
and
moved
the
pack
mules
to
a
considerable
distance
from
camp
after
this
i
returned
to
camp
to
try
to
do
something
for
the
wounded
i
found
that
only
two
were
dangerously
wounded
from
the
leg
of
one
of
these
i
cut
an
arrow
head
and
from
the
shoulder
of
another
i
withdrew
a
spear
point
when
all
the
wounds
had
been
cared
for
i
myself
kept
guard
till
morning
the
next
day
we
loaded
our
wounded
on
the
pack
mules
and
started
for
arizona
the
next
day
we
captured
come
cattle
from
a
herd
and
drove
them
home
with
us
but
it
was
a
very
difficult
matter
to
drive
cattle
when
we
were
on
foot
caring
for
the
wounded
and
keeping
the
cattle
from
escaping
made
our
journey
tedious
but
we
were
not
trailed
and
arrived
safely
at
home
with
all
the
booty
we
then
gave
a
feast
and
dance
and
divided
the
spoils
after
the
dance
we
killed
all
the
cattle
and
dried
the
meat
we
dressed
the
hides
and
then
the
dried
meat
was
packed
in
between
these
hides
and
stored
away
all
that
winter
we
had
plenty
of
meat
these
were
the
first
cattle
we
ever
had
as
usual
we
killed
and
ate
some
of
the
mules
we
had
little
use
for
mules
and
if
we
could
not
trade
them
for
something
of
value
we
killed
them
in
the
summer
of
with
four
warriors
i
went
again
into
mexico
heretofore
we
had
gone
on
foot
we
were
accustomed
to
fight
on
foot
besides
we
could
more
easily
conceal
ourselves
when
dismounted
but
this
time
we
wanted
more
cattle
and
it
was
hard
to
drive
them
when
we
were
on
foot
we
entered
sonora
at
a
point
southwest
from
tombstone
arizona
and
followed
the
sierra
de
antunez
mountains
to
the
southern
limit
then
crossed
the
country
as
far
south
as
the
mouth
of
yaqui
river
here
we
saw
a
great
lake
extending
beyond
the
limit
of
sight
then
we
turned
north
attacked
several
settlements
and
secured
plenty
of
supplies
when
we
had
come
back
northwest
of
arispe
we
secured
about
sixty
head
of
cattle
and
drove
them
to
our
homes
in
arizona
we
did
not
go
directly
home
but
camped
in
different
valleys
with
our
cattle
we
were
not
trailed
when
we
arrived
at
our
camp
the
tribe
was
again
assembled
for
feasting
and
dancing
presents
were
given
to
everybody
then
the
cattle
were
killed

the
meat

with

i
went
into

on
foot
we
attacked
several
settlements
south
of
casa

and
collected
many
horses
and
mules
we
made
our
way
northward
with
these
animals
through
the
mountains
when
near
arispe
we
made
camp
one
evening
and
thinking
that
we
were
not
being
trailed
turned
loose
the
whole
herd
even
those
we
had
been
riding
they
were
in
a
valley
surrounded
by
steep
mountains
and
we
were
camped
at
the
mouth
of
this
valley
so
that
the
animals
could
not
leave
without
coming
through
our
camp
just
as
we
had
begun
to
eat
our
supper
our
scouts
came
in
and
announced
mexican
troops
coming
toward
our
camp
we
started
for
the
horses
but
troops
that
our
scouts
had
not
seen
were
on
the
cliffs
above
us
and
opened
fire
we
scattered
in
all
directions
and
the
troops
recovered
all
our
booty
in
three
days
we
reassembled
at
our
appointed
place
of
rendezvous
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
in
northern
sonora
mexican
troops
did
not
follow
us
and
we
returned
to
arizona
without
any
more
fighting
and
with
no
booty
again
i
had
nothing
to
say
but
i
was
anxious
for
another
raid
early
the
next
summer
i
took
thirty
mounted
warriors
and
invaded
mexican
territory
we
went
south
through
chihuahua
as
far
as
santa
cruz
sonora
then
crossed
over
the
sierra

mountains
following
the
river
course
at
the
south
end
of
the
range
we
kept
on
westward
from
the
sierra
madre
mountains
to
the
sierra
de
sahuripa
mountains
and
followed
that
range
northward
we
collected
all
the
horses
mules
and
cattle
we
wanted
and
drove
them
northward
through
sonora
into
arizona
mexicans
saw
us
at
many
times
and
in
many
places
but
they
did
not
attack
us
at
any
time
nor
did
any
troops
attempt
to
follow
us
when
we
arrived
at
our
homes
we
gave
presents
to
all
and
the
tribe
feasted
and
danced
during
this
raid
we
had
killed

eight
warriors
on
a
raid
into
mexico
i
went
as
a
warrior
for
i
was
always
glad
to
fight
the
mexicans
we
rode
south
from
near
tombstone
arizona
into
sonora
mexico
we
attacked
some
cowboys
and
after
a
fight
with
them
in
which
two
of
their
number
were
killed
we
drove
all
their
cattle
northward
the
second
day
we
were
driving
the
cattle
but
had
no
scouts
out
when
we
were
not
far
from
arispe
mexican
troops
rode
upon
us
they
were
well
armed
and
well
mounted
and
when
we
first
saw
them
they
were
not
half
a
mile
away
from
us
we
left
the
cattle
and
rode
as
hard
as
we
could
toward
the
mountains
but
they
gained
on
us
rapidly
soon
they
opened
fire
but
were
so
far
away
from
us
that
we
were
unable
to
reach
them
with
our
arrows
finally
we
reached
some
timber
and
leaving
our
ponies
fought
from
cover
then
the
mexicans
halted
collected
our
ponies
and
rode
away
across
the
plains
toward
arispe
driving
the
cattle
with
them
we
stood
and
watched
them
until
they
disappeared
in
the
distance
and
then
took
up
our
march
for
home
we
arrived
home
in
five
days
with
no
victory
to
report
no
spoils
to
divide
and
not
even
the
ponies
which
we
had
ridden
into
mexico
this
expedition
was
considered
disgraceful
the
warriors
who
had
been
with
on
this
last
expedition
wanted
to
return
to
mexico
they
were
not
satisfied
besides
they
felt
keenly
the
taunts
of
the
other
warriors
would
not
lead
them
back
so
i
took
command
and
we
went
on
foot
directly
toward
arispe
in
sonora
and
made
our
camp
in
the
sierra
de
sahuripa
mountains
there
were
only
six
of
us
but
we
raided
several
settlements
at
night
captured
many
horses
and
mules
and
loaded
them
with
provisions
saddles
and
blankets
then
we
returned
to
arizona
traveling
only
at
night
when
we
arrived
at
our
camp
we
sent
out
scouts
to
prevent
any
surprise
by
mexicans
assembled
the
tribe
feasted
danced
and
divided
the
spoils
would
not
receive
any
of
this
booty
but
we
did
not
care
no
mexican
troops
followed
us
to
arizona
about
a
year
after
this
mexican
troops
rounded
up
all
the
horses
and
mules
of
the
tribe
not
far
from
our
settlement
no
raids
had
been
made
into
mexico
that
year
and
we
were
not
expecting
any
attacks
we
were
all
in
camp
having
just
returned
from
hunting
about
two
in
the
afternoon
two
mexican
scouts
were
seen
near
our
settlement
we
killed
these
scouts
but
the
troops
got
under
way
with
the
herd
of
our
horses
and
mules
before
we
saw
them
it
was
useless
to
try
to
overtake
them
on
foot
and
our
tribe
had
not
a
horse
left
i
took
twenty
warriors
and
trailed
them
we
found
the
stock
at
a
cattle
ranch
in
sonora
not
far
from
nacozari
and
attacked
the
cowboys
who
had
them
in
charge
we
killed
two
men
and
lost
none
after
the
fight
we
drove
off
our
own
stock
and
all
of
theirs
we
were
trailed
by
nine
cowboys
i
sent
the
stock
on
ahead
and
with
three
warriors
stayed
in
the
rear
to
intercept
any
attacking
parties
one
night
when
near
the
arizona
line
we
discovered
these
cowboys
on
our
trail
and
watched
them
camp
for
the
night
and
picket
their
horses
about
midnight
we
stole
into
their
camp
and
silently
led
away
all
their
horses
leaving
the
cowboys
asleep
then
we
rode
hard
and
overtook
our
companions
who
always
traveled
at
night
instead
of
in
the
daytime
we
turned
these
horses
in
with
the
herd
and
fell
back
to
again
intercept
anyone
who
might
trail
us
what
these
nine
cowboys
did
next
morning
i
do
not
know
and
i
have
never
heard
the
mexicans
say
anything
about
it
i
know
they
did
not
follow
us
for
we
were
not
molested
when
we
arrived
in
camp
at
home
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
tribe
it
was
considered
a
good
trick
to
get
the
mexicans
horses
and
leave
them
asleep
in
the
mountains
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
again
went
into
mexico
or
were
disturbed
by
the
mexicans
chapter
x
other
raids
when
reading
the
foregoing
chapters
of
apache
raids
one
not
acquainted
with
the
lawlessness
of
the
frontier
might
wonder
how
this
tendency
of
the
apaches
was
developed
to
such
a
marked
degree
but
one
acquainted
with
the
real
conditions
the
disregard
for
law
by
both
mexicans
and
white
men
along
the
border
line
of
old
mexico
and
arizona
in
early
days
can
readily
understand
where
the
apache
got
his
education
in
the
art
of
conducting
lawless
raids
in
order
therefore
that
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
conditions
as
they
were
in
southern
arizona
during
the
eighties
may
understand
the
environment
of
the
apaches
this
chapter
is
given
the
events
herein
narrated
are
taken
by
the
author
from
many
accounts
given
him
by
reliable
men
who
lived
in
this
section
of
country
during
the
period
mentioned

apache
camp
by
white
in
a
company
of
six
mexican
traders
who
were
known
as
smugglers
because
they
evaded
duties
on
goods
which
they
brought
into
united
states
and
sold
in
arizona
were
camped
in
skeleton
cañon
ten
miles
north
of
the
north
line
of
old
mexico
they
were
known
to
carry
large
sums
of
money
but
as
they
were
always
armed
and
ready
to
defend
their
possessions
they
were
not
often
molested
however
on
this
occasion
just
as
they
were
rising
in
the
morning
to
prepare
their
breakfast
five
white
men
opened
fire
on
them
from
ambush
and
all
save
one
of
the
mexicans
were
killed
this
one
though
wounded
finally
made
his
escape
a
few
days
after
the
killing
some
cowboys
on
a
camped
at
this
place
and
buried
the
remains
what
the
coyotes
had
left
of
these
five
mexicans
two
years
later
at
the
same
place
a
cowboy
found
a
leather
bag
containing
mexican
dollars
which
small
amount
of
money
had
been
overlooked
by
the
robbers
the
men
who
did
this
killing
lived
in
arizona
for
many
years
afterwards
and
although
it
was
known
that
they
had
committed
the
depredation
no
arrests
followed
and
no
attempt
was
made
by
any
of
the
mexicans
to
recover
the
property
of
their
fellow
citizens
in
a
cattleman
and
four
cowboys
from
his
ranch
started
to
drive
some
fat
cattle
to
market
at
tombstone
arizona
the
route
they
took
led
partly
through
old
mexico
and
partly
through
arizona
one
night
they
camped
in
a
cañon
just
south
of
the
mexican
border
next
morning
at
daylight
the
cowboy
who
had
been
on
herd
duty
the
last
half
of
the
night
had
just
come
in
and
aroused
the
camp
when
the
mexicans
opened
fire
on
them
from
ambush
the
cattleman
and
one
of
the
cowboys
were
severely
wounded
at
the
first
volley
and
took
shelter
behind
the
camp
wagon
from
which
position
they
fired
as
long
as
their
ammunition
lasted
the
other
three
were
only
slightly
wounded
and
reached
cover
but
only
one
escaped
with
his
life
he
remained
in
hiding
for
two
days
before
his
comrades
found
him
he
saw
the
mexicans
rob
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
lead
away
their
saddle
horses
after
having
cooked
breakfast
for
themselves
in
the
deserted
camp
he
was
severely
wounded
and
all
his
ammunition
was
gone
hence
he
could
only
wait
on
the
second
day
after
this
raid
some
of
the
cattle
strayed
back
to
the
old
ranch
thereby
giving
notice
to
the
cowboys
that
there
had
been
foul
play
they
found
their
wounded
companions
lying
delirious
near
the
decaying
bodies
of
their
comrades
no
arrests
were
ever
made
in
mexico
for
these
murders
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
recover
damage
or
prosecute
the
robbers
the
two
instances
above
narrated
will
serve
to
show
the
reader
what
kind
of
an
example
was
set
for
the
apaches
by
at
least
a
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
christian
nations
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
it
is
thought
well
to
give
in
this
chapter
some
of
the
depredations
of
the
apaches
not
told
by
geronimo
they
are
given
as
told
by
our
own
citizens
and
from
the
white
man
point
of
view
in
judge
mccormick
and
wife
accompanied
by
their
young
son
were
driving
from
silver
city
to
lordsburg
when
they
were
ambushed
by
apaches
the
bodies
of
the
adults
were
found
soon
afterward
but
the
child
body
was
never
recovered
years
afterwards
an
apache
squaw
told
some
of
the
settlers
in
arizona
that
the
little
boy
about
eight
years
old
cried
so
much
and
was
so
stubborn
that
they
had
to
kill
him
although
their
original
intention
was
to
spare
his
life
in
a
man
named
hunt
was
wounded
in
a
row
in
a
saloon
in
tombstone
arizona
during
this
row
two
other
men
had
been
killed
and
to
avoid
arrest
hunt
and
his
brother
went
into
the
mountains
and
camped
about
ten
miles
north
of
willow
springs
to
await
the
healing
of
his
wounds
a
few
days
after
they
came
there
apache
indians
attacked
them
and
killed
the
wounded
brother
but
the
other
by
hard
riding
made
good
his
escape
in
two
eastern
boys
went
into
arizona
to
prospect
their
real
outing
began
at
willow
springs
where
they
had
stayed
two
days
with
the
cowboys
these
cowboys
had
warned
them
against
the
apaches
but
the
young
men
seemed
entirely
fearless
and
pushed
on
into
the
mountains
on
the
second
morning
after
they
left
the
settlement
one
of
the
boys
was
getting
breakfast
while
the
other
went
to
bring
in
the
pack
horses
that
had
been
hobbled
and
turned
loose
the
night
before
to
graze
just
about
the
time
he
found
his
horses
two
apache
warriors
rode
out
from
cover
toward
him
and
he
made
a
hasty
retreat
to
camp
jumping
off
of
a
bluff
and
in
so
doing
breaking
his
leg
a
consultation
was
then
held
between
the
two
easterners
and
it
was
decided
that
perhaps
all
the
stories
they
had
been
told
of
the
apache
raids
were
true
and
that
it
was
advisable
to
surrender
accordingly
a
white
handkerchief
was
tied
to
the
end
of
a
pole
and
raised
cautiously
above
the
top
of
the
bluff
in
about
ten
minutes
the
two
indians
one
a
very
old
warrior
and
the
other
a
mere
boy
evidently
his
son
rode
into
camp
and
dismounted
the
old
warrior
examined
the
broken
limb
then
without
a
word
proceeded
to
take
off
the
shirt
of
the
uninjured
youth
with
strips
of
which
he
carefully
bound
up
the
broken
leg
after
this
the
two
indians
ate
the
prepared
breakfast
and
remounted
their
ponies
then
the
old
warrior
indicating
the
direction
with
his
thumb
said
doctor
lordsburg
three
days
and
silently
rode
away
the
young
men
rode
miles
to
sansimone
where
the
cowboys
fitted
them
out
with
a
wagon
to
continue
their
journey
to
lordsburg
miles
further
where
a
physician
services
could
be
secured
in
two
prospectors
alberts
and
reese
by
name
were
driving
a
team
consisting
of
a
horse
and
a
mule
through
turkey
creek
bottoms
when
they
were
shot
by
the
indians
the
wagon
and
harness
were
left
in
the
road
and
the
mule
was
found
dead
in
the
road
two
hundred
yards
from
that
place
evidently
the
indians
had
not
much
use
for
him
the
guns
of
the
prospectors
were
found
later
but
the
horse
they
drove
was
not
recovered
in
none
of
the
instances
were
the
bodies
of
the
victims
mutilated
however
there
are
many
recorded
instances
in
which
the
apache
indians
did
mutilate
the
bodies
of
their
victims
but
it
is
claimed
by
geronimo
that
these
were
outlawed
indians
as
his
regular
warriors
were
instructed
to
scalp
none
except
those
killed
in
battle
and
to
torture
none
except
to
make
them
reveal
desired
information
in
two
cowboys
in
the
employment
of
the
sansimone
cattle
company
were
camped
at
willow
springs
eighteen
miles
southwest
of
skeleton
cañon
and
not
far
from
old
mexico
just
at
sundown
their
camp
was
surrounded
by
apaches
in
war
paint
who
said
that
they
had
been
at
war
with
the
mexicans
and
wished
to
return
to
the
united
states
there
were
about
indians
in
the
whole
tribe
the
squaws
and
children
coming
up
later
they
had
with
them
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
mexican
horses
the
indians
took
possession
of
the
camp
and
remained
for
about
ten
days
getting
their
supplies
of
meat
by
killing
cattle
of
the
company
with
this
band
of
indians
was
a
white
boy
about
fourteen
years
old
who
had
evidently
been
with
them
from
infancy
for
he
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
and
did
not
understand
much
spanish
but
spoke
the
apache
language
readily
they
would
allow
but
one
of
the
cowboys
to
leave
camp
at
a
time
keeping
the
other
under
guard
they
had
sentinels
with
spyglasses
on
all
the
hills
and
peaks
surrounding
the
camp
one
evening
when
one
of
the
cowboys
william
berne
had
been
allowed
to
pass
out
of
the
camp
he
noticed
an
indian
dismounted
and
as
he
approached
discovered
that
the
indian
had
him
under
range
of
his
rifle
he
immediately
dismounted
and
standing
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
redskin
threw
his
own
winchester
across
his
horse
neck
when
the
indian
sprang
on
his
horse
and
galloped
toward
him
at
full
speed
making
signs
to
him
not
to
shoot
and
when
he
approached
him
dismounted
and
pointing
to
the
ground
showed
berne
many
fresh
deer
tracks
then
as
an
understanding
had
been
established
the
cowboy
remounted
and
went
on
his
way
leaving
the
apache
to
hunt
the
deer
one
day
when
this
cowboy
was
about
ten
miles
from
camp
he
found
two
splendid
horses
of
the
indians
these
horses
had
strayed
from
the
herd
thinking
that
they
would
in
a
way
compensate
for
the
cattle
the
apaches
were
eating
he
drove
them
on
for
about
five
miles
into
a
cañon
where
there
was
plenty
of
grass
and
water
and
left
them
there
intending
to
come
back
after
the
departure
of
the
indians
and
take
possession
of
them
on
the
tenth
day
after
the
arrival
of
this
band
of
indians
united
states
troops
accompanied
by
two
indians
who
had
been
sent
to
make
the
arrangements
arrived
in
camp
paid
for
the
cattle
the
apaches
had
eaten
took
the
indians
and
their
stock
and
moved
on
toward
fort
bowie
the
cowboys
immediately
started
for
the
cañon
where
the
two
horses
had
been
left
but
had
not
gone
far
when
they
met
two
indians
driving
these
horses
in
front
of
them
as
they
pushed
on
to
overtake
the
tribe

evidently
the
shrewdness
of
the
paleface
had
not
outwitted
the
red
man
that
time
geronimo
says
he
was
in
no
wise
connected
with
the
events
herein
mentioned
but
refuses
to
state
whether
he
knows
anything
about
them
he
holds
it
unmanly
to
tell
of
any
depredations
of
red
men
except
those
for
which
he
was
responsible
such
were
the
events
transpiring
in
apache
land
during
the
days
when
geronimo
was
leading
his
warriors
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
his
people
this
chapter
will
serve
to
show
that
the
apache
had
plenty
of
examples
of
lawlessness
furnished
him
and
also
that
he
was
a
very
apt
scholar
in
this
school
of
savage
lawlessness
chapter
xi
heavy
fighting
about
we
were
again
attacked
by
mexican
troops
in
our
settlement
but
we
defeated
them
then
we
decided
to
make
raids
into
mexico
we
moved
our
whole
camp
packing
all
our
belongings
on
mules
and
horses
went
into
mexico
and
made
camp
in
the
mountains
near
nacori
in
moving
our
camp
in
this
way
we
wanted
no
one
to
spy
on
us
and
if
we
passed
a
mexican
home
we
usually
killed
the
inmates
however
if
they
offered
to
surrender
and
made
no
resistance
or
trouble
in
any
way
we
would
take
them
prisoners
frequently
we
would
change
our
place
of
rendezvous
then
we
would
take
with
us
our
prisoners
if
they
were
willing
to
go
but
if
they
were
unruly
they
might
be
killed
i
remember
one
mexican
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
who
saw
us
moving
and
delayed
us
for
some
time
we
took
the
trouble
to
get
him
thinking
the
plunder
of
his
house
would
pay
us
for
the
delay
but
after
we
had
killed
him
we
found
nothing
in
his
house
worth
having
we
ranged
in
these
mountains
for
over
a
year
raiding
the
mexican
settlements
for
our
supplies
but
not
having
any
general
engagement
with
mexican
troops
then
we
returned
to
our
homes
in
arizona
after
remaining
in
arizona
about
a
year
we
returned
to
mexico
and
went
into
hiding
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
our
camp
was
near
nacori
and
we
had
just
organized
bands
of
warriors
for
raiding
the
country
when
our
scouts
discovered
mexican
troops
coming
toward
our
camp
to
attack
us
of
white
the
chief
of
the
nedni
apaches
whoa
was
with
me
and
commanded
one
division
the
warriors
were
all
marched
toward
the
troops
and
met
them
at
a
place
about
five
miles
from
our
camp
we
showed
ourselves
to
the
soldiers
and
they
quickly
rode
to
the
top
of
a
hill
and
dismounted
placing
their
horses
on
the
outside
for
breastworks
it
was
a
round
hill
very
steep
and
rocky
and
there
was
no
timber
on
its
sides
there
were
two
companies
of
mexican
cavalry
and
we
had
about
sixty
warriors
we
crept
up
the
hill
behind
the
rocks
and
they
kept
up
a
constant
fire
but
i
had
cautioned
our
warriors
not
to
expose
themselves
to
the
mexicans
i
knew
that
the
troopers
would
waste
their
ammunition
soon
we
had
killed
all
their
horses
but
the
soldiers
would
lie
behind
these
and
shoot
at
us
while
we
had
killed
several
mexicans
we
had
not
yet
lost
a
man
however
it
was
impossible
to
get
very
close
to
them
in
this
way
and
i
deemed
it
best
to
lead
a
charge
against
them
we
had
been
fighting
ever
since
about
one
and
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
seeing
that
we
were
making
no
further
progress
i
gave
the
sign
for
the
advance
the
sounded
and
we
leaped
forward
from
every
stone
over
the
mexicans
dead
horses
fighting
hand
to
hand
the
attack
was
so
sudden
that
the
mexicans
running
first
this
way
and
then
that
became
so
confused
that
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
killed
them
all
then
we
scalped
the
slain
carried
away
our
dead
and
secured
all
the
arms
we
needed
that
night
we
moved
our
camp
eastward
through
the
sierra
madre
mountains
into
chihuahua
no
troops
molested
us
here
and
after
about
a
year
we
returned
to
arizona

there
were
at
this
time
many
settlements

game
was
not
plentiful
and
besides
we
liked
to
go
down
into

besides
the

our
friends
and
kinsmen
extended
far
into

their
chief
whoa
was
as
a
brother
to
me
and
we
spent
much
of
our
time
in
his
territory
about
we
were
in
camp
in
the
mountains
south
of
casa
grande
when
a
company
of
mexican
troops
attacked
us
there
were
mexican
soldiers
and
about
forty
indians
the
mexicans
surprised
us
in
camp
and
fired
on
us
killing
two
indians
the
first
volley
i
do
not
know
how
they
were
able
to
find
our
camp
unless
they
had
excellent
scouts
and
our
guards
were
careless
but
there
they
were
shooting
at
us
before
we
knew
they
were
near
we
were
in
the
timber
and
i
gave
the
order
to
go
forward
and
fight
at
close
range
we
kept
behind
rocks
and
trees
until
we
came
within
ten
yards
of
their
line
then
we
stood
up
and
both
sides
shot
until
all
the
mexicans
were
killed
we
lost
twelve
warriors
in
this
battle
this
place
was
called
by
the
indians
when
we
had
buried
our
dead
and
secured
what
supplies
the
mexicans
had
we
went
northeast
at
a
place
near
nacori
mexican
troops
attacked
us
at
this
place
called
by
the
indians
nokode
there
were
about
eighty
warriors
bedonkohe
and
nedni
apaches
there
were
three
companies
of
mexican
troops
they
attacked
us
in
an
open
field
and
we
scattered
firing
as
we
ran
they
followed
us
but
we
dispersed
and
soon
were
free
from
their
pursuit
then
we
reassembled
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
here
a
council
was
held
and
as
mexican
troops
were
coming
from
many
quarters
we
disbanded
in
about
four
months
we
reassembled
at
casa
grande
to
make
a
treaty
of
peace
the
chiefs
of
the
town
of
casa
grande
and
all
of
the
men
of
casa
grande
made
a
treaty
with
us
we
shook
hands
and
promised
to
be
brothers
then
we
began
to
trade
and
the
mexicans
gave
us
mescal
soon
nearly
all
the
indians
were
drunk
while
they
were
drunk
two
companies
of
mexican
troops
from
another
town
attacked
us
killed
twenty
indians
and
captured
many
more
we
fled
in
all
directions
footnote
it
is
impossible
to
get
geronimo
to
understand
that
these
troops
served
the
general
government
instead
of
any
particular
town
he
still
thinks
each
town
independent
and
each

a

he
can
not
understand
the
relation

after
the

and
massacre
of
casa

we
did
not
reassemble
for
a
long
while
and
when
we
did
we
returned
to
arizona
we
remained
in
arizona
for
some
time
living
in
san
carlos
reservation
at
a
place
now
called
geronimo
in
we
went
into
mexico
again
we
remained
in
the
mountain
ranges
of
mexico
for
about
fourteen
months
and
during
this
time
we
had
many
skirmishes
with
mexican
troops
in
we
returned
to
arizona
to
get
other
apaches
to
come
with
us
into
mexico
the
mexicans
were
gathering
troops
in
the
mountains
where
we
had
been
ranging
and
their
numbers
were
so
much
greater
than
ours
that
we
could
not
hope
to
fight
them
successfully
and
we
were
tired
of
being
chased
about
from
place
to
place
in
arizona
we
had
trouble
with
the
united
states
soldiers
explained
in
next
chapter
and
returned
to
mexico
we
had
lost
about
fifteen
warriors
in
arizona
and
had
gained
no
recruits
with
our
reduced
number
we
camped
in
the
mountains
north
of
arispe
mexican
troops
were
seen
by
our
scouts
in
several
directions
the
united
states
troops
were
coming
down
from
the
north
we
were
well
armed
with
guns
and
supplied
with
ammunition
but
we
did
not
care
to
be
surrounded
by
the
troops
of
two
governments
so
we
started
to
move
our
camp
southward
one
night
we
made
camp
some
distance
from
the
mountains
by
a
stream
there
was
not
much
water
in
the
stream
but
a
deep
channel
was
worn
through
the
prairie
and
small
trees
were
beginning
to
grow
here
and
there
along
the
bank
of
this
stream
in
those
days
we
never
camped
without
placing
scouts
for
we
knew
that
we
were
liable
to
be
attacked
at
any
time
the
next
morning
just
at
daybreak
our
scouts
came
in
aroused
the
camp
and
notified
us
that
mexican
troops
were
approaching
within
five
minutes
the
mexicans
began
firing
on
us
we
took
to
the
ditches
made
by
the
stream

had
the
women
and
children
busy
digging
these
deeper
i
gave
strict
orders
to
waste
no
ammunition
and
keep
under
cover

killed
many
mexicans

day

in
turn
lost

all
day

would
charge
at

point
be
repulsed
then
rally
and
charge
at
another
point
about
noon
we
began
to
hear
them
speaking
my
name
with
curses
in
the
afternoon
the
general
came
on
the
field
and
the
fighting
became
more
furious
i
gave
orders
to
my
warriors
to
try
to
kill
all
the
mexican
officers
about
three
the
general
called
all
the
officers
together
at
the
right
side
of
the
field
the
place
where
they
assembled
was
not
very
far
from
the
main
stream
and
a
little
ditch
ran
out
close
to
where
the
officers
stood
cautiously
i
crawled
out
this
ditch
very
close
to
where
the
council
was
being
held
the
general
was
an
old
warrior
the
wind
was
blowing
in
my
direction
so
that
i
could
hear
all
he
said
and
i
understood
most
of
it
this
is
about
what
he
told
them
officers
yonder
in
those
ditches
is
the
red
devil
geronimo
and
his
hated

this
must
be
his
last

dead
indians
are
what
we
want
do
not
spare
your
own

exterminate
this
band
at
any
cost
i
will
post
the
wounded
to
shoot
all
deserters
go
back
to
your
companies
and
advance
just
as
the
command
to
go
forward
was
given
i
took
deliberate
aim
at
the
general
and
he
fell
in
an
instant
the
ground
around
me
was
riddled
with
bullets
but
i
was
untouched
the
apaches
had
seen
from
all
along
the
ditches
arose
the
fierce
of
my
people
the
columns
wavered
an
instant
and
then
swept
on
they
did
not
retreat
until
our
fire
had
destroyed
the
front
ranks

yet
they
continued
to

and

until
dark
they
also
continued
to
speak
my
name
with
threats
and
curses
that
night
before
the
firing
had

a
dozen
indians
had
crawled
out
of

set

to
the
long

the

that
i
ever
fought

chapter

coming
of
the
white
men
about
the
time
of
the
massacre
of
kaskiyeh
we
heard
that
some
white
men
were
measuring
land
to
the
south
of
us
in
company
with
a
number
of
other
warriors
i
went
to
visit
them
we
could
not
understand
them
very
well
for
we
had
no
interpreter
but
we
made
a
treaty
with
them
by
shaking
hands
and
promising
to
be
brothers
then
we
made
our
camp
near
their
camp
and
they
came
to
trade
with
us
we
gave
them
buckskin
blankets
and
ponies
in
exchange
for
shirts
and
provisions
we
also
brought
them
game
for
which
they
gave
us
some
money
we
did
not
know
the
value
of
this
money
but
we
kept
it
and
later
learned
from
the
navajo
indians
that
it
was
very
valuable
every
day
they
measured
land
with
curious
instruments
and
put
down
marks
which
we
could
not
understand
they
were
good
men
and
we
were
sorry
when
they
had
gone
on
into
the
west
they
were
not
soldiers
these
were
the
first
white
men
i
ever
saw
about
ten
years
later
some
more
white
men
came
these
were
all
warriors
they
made
their
camp
on
the
gila
river
south
of
hot
springs
at
first
they
were
friendly
and
we
did
not
dislike
them
but
they
were
not
as
good
as
those
who
came
first
after
about
a
year
some
trouble
arose
between
them
and
the
indians
and
i
took
the
warpath
as
a
warrior
not
as
a
chief
i
had
not
been
wronged
but
some
of
my
people
had
been
and
i
fought
with
my
tribe
for
the
soldiers
and
not
the
indians
were
at
fault
not
long
after
this
some
of
the
officers
of
the
united
states
troops
invited
our
leaders
to
hold
a
conference
at
apache
pass
fort
bowie
just
before
noon
the
indians
were
shown
into
a
tent
and
told
that
they
would
be
given
something
to
eat
when
in
the
tent
they
were
attacked
by
soldiers
our
chief
and
several
other
warriors
by
cutting
through
the
tent
escaped
but
most
of
the
warriors
were
killed
or
captured
among
the
bedonkohe
apaches
killed
at
this
time
were
sanza
kladetahe
niyokahe
and
gopi
after
this
treachery
the
indians
went
back
to
the
mountains
and
left
the
fort
entirely
alone
i
do
not
think
that
the
agent
had
anything
to
do
with
planning
this
for
he
had
always
treated
us
well
i
believe
it
was
entirely
planned
by
the
soldiers
from
the
very
first
the
soldiers
sent
out
to
our
western
country
and
the
officers
in
charge
of
them
did
not
hesitate
to
wrong
the
indians
they
never
explained
to
the
government
when
an
indian
was
wronged
but
always
reported
the
misdeeds
of
the
indians
much
that
was
done
by
mean
white
men
was
reported
at
washington
as
the
deeds
of
my
people
the
indians
always
tried
to
live
peaceably
with
the
white
soldiers
and
settlers
one
day
during
the
time
that
the
soldiers
were
stationed
at
apache
pass
i
made
a
treaty
with
the
post
this
was
done
by
shaking
hands
and
promising
to
be
brothers
cochise
and
did
likewise
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
officer
in
command
but
this
was
the
first
regiment
that
ever
came
to
apache
pass
this
treaty
was
made
about
a
year
before
we
were
attacked
in
a
tent
as
above
related
in
a
few
days
after
the
attack
at
apache
pass
we
organized
in
the
mountains
and
returned
to
fight
the
soldiers
there
were
two
tribes
the
bedonkohe
and
the
chokonen
apaches
both
commanded
by
cochise
after
a
few
days
skirmishing
we
attacked
a
freight
train
that
was
coming
in
with
supplies
for
the
fort
we
killed
some
of
the
men
and
captured
the
others
these
prisoners
our
chief
offered
to
trade
for
the
indians
whom
the
soldiers
had
captured
at
the
massacre
in
the
tent
this
the
officers
refused
so
we
killed
our
prisoners
disbanded
and
went
into
hiding
in
the
mountains
of
those
who
took
part
in
this
affair
i
am
the
only
one
now
living
in
a
few
days
troops
were
sent
out
to
search
for
us
but
as
we
were
disbanded
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
them
to
locate
any
hostile
camp
during
the
time
they
were
searching
for
us
many
of
our
warriors
who
were
thought
by
the
soldiers
to
be
peaceable
indians
talked
to
the
officers
and
men
advising
them
where
they
might
find
the
camp
they
sought
and
while
they
searched
we
watched
them
from
our
hiding
places
and
laughed
at
their
failures
after
this
trouble
all
of
the
indians
agreed
not
to
be
friendly
with
the
white
men
any
more
there
was
no
general
engagement
but
a
long
struggle
followed
sometimes
we
attacked
the
white
men
sometimes
they
attacked
us
first
a
few
indians
would
be
killed
and
then
a
few
soldiers
i
think
the
killing
was
about
equal
on
each
side
the
number
killed
in
these
troubles
did
not
amount
to
much
but
this
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
soldiers
had
angered
the
indians
and
revived
memories
of
other
wrongs
so
that
we
never
again
trusted
the
united
states
troops

on
the
warpath
for
some
time
and
he
with
a
number
of

chiefs
was

into

military
camp
at

the
promise
that

chapter

greatest
of
wrongs
perhaps
the
greatest
wrong
ever
done
to
the
indians
was
the
treatment
received
by
our
tribe
from
the
united
states
troops
about
the
chief
of
our
tribe
went
to
make
a
treaty
of
peace
for
our
people
with
the
white
settlement
at
apache
tejo
new
mexico
it
had
been
reported
to
us
that
the
white
men
in
this
settlement
were
more
friendly
and
more
reliable
than
those
in
arizona
that
they
would
live
up
to
their
treaties
and
would
not
wrong
the
indians
with
three
other
warriors
went
to
apache
tejo
and
held
a
council
with
these
citizens
and
soldiers
they
told
him
that
if
he
would
come
with
his
tribe
and
live
near
them
they
would
issue
to
him
from
the
government
blankets
flour
provisions
beef
and
all
manner
of
supplies
our
chief
promised
to
return
to
apache
tejo
within
two
weeks
when
he
came
back
to
our
settlement
he
assembled
the
whole
tribe
in
council
i
did
not
believe
that
the
people
at
apache
tejo
would
do
as
they
said
and
therefore
i
opposed
the
plan
but
it
was
decided
that
with
part
of
the
tribe
should
return
to
apache
tejo
and
receive
an
issue
of
rations
and
supplies
if
they
were
as
represented
and
if
these
white
men
would
keep
the
treaty
faithfully
the
remainder
of
the
tribe
would
join
him
and
we
would
make
our
permanent
home
at
apache
tejo
i
was
to
remain
in
charge
of
that
portion
of
the
tribe
which
stayed
in
arizona
we
gave
almost
all
of
our
arms
and
ammunition
to
the
party
going
to
apache
tejo
so
that
in
case
there
should
be
treachery
they
would
be
prepared
for
any
surprise
and
about
half
of
our
people
went
to
new
mexico
happy
that
now
they
had
found
white
men
who
would
be
kind
to
them
and
with
whom
they
could
live
in
peace
and
plenty
no
word
ever
came
to
us
from
them
from
other
sources
however
we
heard
that
they
had
been
treacherously
captured
and
slain
in
this
dilemma
we
did
not
know
just
exactly
what
to
do
but
fearing
that
the
troops
who
had
captured
them
would
attack
us
we
retreated
into
the
mountains
near
apache
pass
during
the
weeks
that
followed
the
departure
of
our
people
we
had
been
in
suspense
and
failing
to
provide
more
supplies
had
exhausted
all
of
our
store
of
provisions
this
was
another
reason
for
moving
camp
on
this
retreat
while
passing
through
the
mountains
we
discovered
four
men
with
a
herd
of
cattle
two
of
the
men
were
in
front
in
a
buggy
and
two
were
behind
on
horseback
we
killed
all
four
but
did
not
scalp
them
they
were
not
warriors
we
drove
the
cattle
back
into
the
mountains
made
a
camp
and
began
to
kill
the
cattle
and
pack
the
meat
before
we
had
finished
this
work
we
were
surprised
and
attacked
by
united
states
troops
who
killed
in
all
seven
indians
one
warrior
three
women
and
three
children
the
government
troops
were
mounted
and
so
were
we
but
we
were
poorly
armed
having
given
most
of
our
weapons
to
the
division
of
our
tribe
that
had
gone
to
apache
tejo
so
we
fought
mainly
with
spears
bows
and
arrows
at
first
i
had
a
spear
a
bow
and
a
few
arrows
but
in
a
short
time
my
spear
and
all
my
arrows
were
gone
once
i
was
surrounded
but
by
dodging
from
side
to
side
of
my
horse
as
he
ran
i
escaped
it
was
necessary
during
this
fight
for
many
of
the
warriors
to
leave
their
horses
and
escape
on
foot
but
my
horse
was
trained
to
come
at
call
and
as
soon
as
i
reached
a
safe
place
if
not
too
closely
pursued
i
would
call
him
to
me
during
this
fight
we
scattered
in
all
directions
and
two
days
later
reassembled
at
our
appointed
place
of
rendezvous
about
fifty
miles
from
the
scene
of
this
battle
about
ten
days
later
the
same
united
states
troops
attacked
our
new
camp
at
sunrise
the
fight
lasted
all
day
but
our
arrows
and
spears
were
all
gone
before
ten
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
we
had
only
rocks
and
clubs
with
which
to
fight
we
could
do
little
damage
with
these
weapons
and
at
night
we
moved
our
camp
about
four
miles
back
into
the
mountains
where
it
would
be
hard
for
the
cavalry
to
follow
us
the
next
day
our
scouts
who
had
been
left
behind
to
observe
the
movements
of
the
soldiers
returned
saying
that
the
troops
had
gone
back
toward
san

reservation
a
few
days
after
this
we
were
again
attacked
by
another
company
of

troops
just
before
this
fight
we
had
been
joined
by
a
band
of
chokonen
indians
under
cochise
who
took
command
of
both
divisions
we
were
repulsed
and
decided
to
disband

we
had
disbanded

a

was
held
and
as
it
was
believed
that
was
dead
i
was
elected
tribal

for
a

had
no

anyone
it
was
more
than

the
time
of
the
incident
with
cochise
at
bowie
the
old
chief
was
always
for
peace
and
gladly
accepted
the
proffer
when
he
appeared
at
the
camp
general
west
ordered
him
put
into
the
guardhouse
in
which
there
was
only
a
small
opening
in
the
rear
and
but
one
small
window
as
the
old
chief
entered
he
said
is
my
end
i
shall
never
again
hunt
over
the
mountains
and
through
the
valleys
of
my
people
he
felt
that
he
was
to
be
assassinated
the
guards
were
given
orders
to
shoot
him
if
he
attempted
to
escape
he
lay
down
and
tried
to
sleep
but
during
the
night
someone
threw
a
large
stone
which
struck
him
in
the
breast
he
sprang
up
and
in
his
delirium
the
guards
thought
he
was
attempting
escape
and
several
of
them
shot
him
this
was
the
end
of
mangus
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
by
a
surgeon
and
the
brain
taken
out
and
weighed
the
head
measured
larger
than
that
of
daniel
webster
and
the
brain
was
of
corresponding
weight
the
skull
was
sent
to
washington
and
is
now
on
exhibition
at
the
smithsonian
institution
chapter
xv
removals
while
returning
from
trailing
the
government
troops
we
saw
two
men
a
mexican
and
a
white
man
and
shot
them
off
their
horses
with
these
two
horses
we
returned
and
moved
our
camp
my
people
were
suffering
much
and
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
go
where
we
could
get
more
provisions
game
was
scarce
in
our
range
then
and
since
i
had
been
tribal
chief
i
had
not
asked
for
rations
from
the
government
nor
did
i
care
to
do
so
but
we
did
not
wish
to
starve
we
had
heard
that
chief
victoria
of
the
chihenne
oje
caliente
apaches
was
holding
a
council
with
the
white
men
near
hot
springs
in
new
mexico
and
that
he
had
plenty
of
provisions
we
had
always
been
on
friendly
terms
with
this
tribe
and
victoria
was
especially
kind
to
my
people
with
the
help
of
the
two
horses
we
had
captured
to
carry
our
sick
with
us
we
went
to
hot
springs
we
easily
found
victoria
and
his
band
and
they
gave
us
supplies
for
the
winter
we
stayed
with
them
for
about
a
year
and
during
this
stay
we
had
perfect
peace
we
had
not
the
least
trouble
with
mexicans
white
men
or
indians
when
we
had
stayed
as
long
as
we
should
and
had
again
accumulated
some
supplies
we
decided
to
leave
victoria
band
when
i
told
him
that
we
were
going
to
leave
he
said
that
we
should
have
a
feast
and
dance
before
we
separated
the
festivities
were
held
about
two
miles
above
hot
springs
and
lasted
for
four
days
there
were
about
four
hundred
indians
at
this
celebration
i
do
not
think
we
ever
spent
a
more
pleasant
time
than
upon
this
occasion
no
one
ever
treated
our
tribe
more
kindly
than
victoria
and
his
band
we
are
still
proud
to
say
that
he
and
his
people
were
our
friends
when
i
went
to
apache
pass
fort
bowie
i
found
general
howard
in
command
and
made
a
treaty
with
him
this
treaty
lasted
until
long
after
general
howard
had
left
our
country
he
always
kept
his
word
with
us
and
treated
us
as
brothers
we
never
had
so
good
a
friend
among
the
united
states
officers
as
general
howard
we
could
have
lived
forever
at
peace
with
him
if
there
is
any
pure
honest
white
man
in
the
united
states
army
that
man
is
general
howard
all
the
indians
respect
him
and
even
to
this
day
frequently
talk
of
the
happy
times
when
general
howard
was
in
command
of
our
post
after
he
went
away
he
placed
an
agent
at
apache
pass
who
issued
to
us
from
the
government
clothing
rations
and
supplies
as
general
howard
directed
when
beef
was
issued
to
the
indians
i
got
twelve
steers
for
my
tribe
and
cochise
got
twelve
steers
for
his
tribe
rations
were
issued
about
once
a
month
but
if
we
ran
out
we
only
had
to
ask
and
we
were
supplied
now
as
prisoners
of
war
in
this
reservation
we
do
not
get
such
good
rations
out
on
the
prairie
away
from
apache
pass
a
man
kept
a
store
and
saloon
some
time
after
general
howard
went
away
a
band
of
outlawed
indians
killed
this
man
and
took
away
many
of
the
supplies
from
his
store
on
the
very
next
day
after
this
some
indians
at
the
post
were
drunk
on
tiswin
which
they
had
made
from
corn
they
fought
among
themselves
and
four
of
them
were
killed
there
had
been
quarrels
and
feuds
among
them
for
some
time
and
after
this
trouble
we
deemed
it
impossible
to
keep
the
different
bands
together
in
peace
therefore
we
separated
each
leader
taking
his
own
band
some
of
them
went
to
san
carlos
and
some
to
old
mexico
but
i
took
my
tribe
back
to
hot
springs
and
rejoined
victoria
band
footnotes
general
howard
was
not
in
command
but
had
been
sent
by
president
grant
in
to
make
peace
with
the
apache
indians
the
general
wrote
me
from
burlington
under
date
of
june
that
he
remembered
the
treaty
and
that
he
also
remembered
with
much
satisfaction
subsequently
meeting
editor
they
do
not
receive
full
rations
now
as
they
did
then
chapter
xvi
in
prison
and
on
the
warpath
soon
after
we
arrived
in
new
mexico
two
companies
of
scouts
were
sent
from
san
carlos
when
they
came
to
hot
springs
they
sent
word
for
me
and
victoria
to
come
to
town
the
messengers
did
not
say
what
they
wanted
with
us
but
as
they
seemed
friendly
we
thought
they
wanted
a
council
and
rode
in
to
meet
the
officers
as
soon
as
we
arrived
in
town
soldiers
met
us
disarmed
us
and
took
us
both
to
headquarters
where
we
were
tried
by
they
asked
us
only
a
few
questions
and
then
victoria
was
released
and
i
was
sentenced
to
the
guardhouse
scouts
conducted
me
to
the
guardhouse
and
put
me
in
chains
when
i
asked
them
why
they
did
this
they
said
it
was
because
i
had
left
apache
pass
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
belonged
to
those
soldiers
at
apache
pass
or
that
i
should
have
asked
them
where
i
might
go
our
bands
could
no
longer
live
in
peace
together
and
so
we
had
quietly
withdrawn
expecting
to
live
with
victoria
band
where
we
thought
we
would
not
be
molested
they
also
sentenced
seven
other
apaches
to
chains
in
the
guardhouse
i
do
not
know
why
this
was
done
for
these
indians
had
simply
followed
me
from
apache
pass
to
hot
springs
if
it
was
wrong
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
wrong
for
us
to
go
to
hot
springs
i
alone
was
to
blame
they
asked
the
soldiers
in
charge
why
they
were
imprisoned
and
chained
but
received
no
answer
i
was
kept
a
prisoner
for
four
months
during
which
time
i
was
transferred
to
san
carlos
then
i
think
i
had
another
trial
although
i
was
not
present
in
fact
i
do
not
know
that
i
had
another
trial
but
i
was
told
that
i
had
and
at
any
rate
i
was
released
after
this
we
had
no
more
trouble
with
the
soldiers
but
i
never
felt
at
ease
any
longer
at
the
post
we
were
allowed
to
live
above
san
carlos
at
a
place
now
called
geronimo
a
man
whom
the
indians
called
nick
golee
was
agent
at
this
place
all
went
well
here
for
a
period
of
two
years
but
we
were
not
satisfied
in
the
summer
of
a
rumor
was
current
that
the
officers
were
again
planning
to
imprison
our
leaders
this
rumor
served
to
revive
the
memory
of
all
our
past
wrongs
the
massacre
in
the
tent
at
apache
pass
the
fate
of
and
my
own
unjust
imprisonment
which
might
easily
have
been
death
to
me
just
at
this
time
we
were
told
that
the
officers
wanted
us
to
come
up
the
river
above
geronimo
to
a
fort
fort
thomas
to
hold
a
council
with
them
we
did
not
believe
that
any
good
could
come
of
this
conference
or
that
there
was
any
need
of
it
so
we
held
a
council
ourselves
and
fearing
treachery
decided
to
leave
the
reservation
we
thought
it
more
manly
to
die
on
the
warpath
than
to
be
killed
in
prison
there
were
in
all
about
indians
chiefly
the
bedonkohe
and
nedni
apaches
led
by
myself
and
whoa
we
went
through
apache
pass
and
just
west
of
there
had
a
fight
with
the
united
states
troops
in
this
battle
we
killed
three
soldiers
and
lost
none
we
went
on
toward
old
mexico
but
on
the
second
day
after
this
united
states
soldiers
overtook
us
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
we
fought
until
dark
the
ground
where
we
were
attacked
was
very
rough
which
was
to
our
advantage
for
the
troops
were
compelled
to
dismount
in
order
to
fight
us
i
do
not
know
how
many
soldiers
we
killed
but
we
lost
only
one
warrior
and
three
children
we
had
plenty
of
guns
and
ammunition
at
this
time
many
of
the
guns
and
much
ammunition
we
had
accumulated
while
living
in
the
reservation
and
the
remainder
we
had
obtained
from
the
white
mountain
apaches
when
we
left
the
reservation
troops
did
not
follow
us
any
longer
so
we
went
south
almost
to
casa
grande
and
camped
in
the
sierra
de
sahuaripa
mountains
we
ranged
in
the
mountains
of
old
mexico
for
about
a
year
then
returned
to
san
carlos
taking
with
us
a
herd
of
cattle
and
horses
soon
after
we
arrived
at
san
carlos
the
officer
in
charge
general
crook
took
the
horses
and
cattle
away
from
us
i
told
him
that
these
were
not
white
men
cattle
but
belonged
to
us
for
we
had
taken
them
from
the
mexicans
during
our
wars
i
also
told
him
that
we
did
not
intend
to
kill
these
animals
but
that
we
wished
to
keep
them
and
raise
stock
on
our
range
he
would
not
listen
to
me
but
took
the
stock
i
went
up
near
fort
apache
and
general
crook
ordered
officers
soldiers
and
scouts
to
see
that
i
was
arrested
if
i
offered
resistance
they
were
instructed
to
kill
me
this
information
was
brought
to
me
by
the
indians
when
i
learned
of
this
proposed
action
i
left
for
old
mexico
and
about
four
hundred
indians
went
with
me
they
were
the
bedonkohe
chokonen
and
nedni
apaches
at
this
time
whoa
was
dead
and
naiche
was
the
only
chief
with
me
we
went
south
into
sonora
and
camped
in
the
mountains
troops
followed
us
but
did
not
attack
us
until
we
were
camped
in
the
mountains
west
of
casa
grande
here
we
were
attacked
by
government
indian
scouts
one
boy
was
killed
and
nearly
all
of
our
women
and
children
were
captured
after
this
battle
we
went
south
of
casa
grande
and
made
a
camp
but
within
a
few
days
this
camp
was
attacked
by
mexican
soldiers
we
skirmished
with
them
all
day
killing
a
few
mexicans
but
sustaining
no
loss
ourselves
that
night
we
went
east
into
the
foothills
of
the
sierra
madre
mountains
and
made
another
camp
mexican
troops
trailed
us
and
after
a
few
days
attacked
our
camp
again
this
time
the
mexicans
had
a
very
large
army
and
we
avoided
a
general
engagement
it
is
senseless
to
fight
when
you
can
not
hope
to
win
that
night
we
held
a
council
of
war
our
scouts
had
reported
bands
of
united
states
and
mexican
troops
at
many
points
in
the
mountains
we
estimated
that
about
two
thousand
soldiers
were
ranging
these
mountains
seeking
to
capture
us
general
crook
had
come
down
into
mexico
with
the
united
states
troops
they
were
camped
in
the
sierra
de
antunez
mountains
scouts
told
me
that
general
crook
wished
to
see
me
and
i
went
to
his
camp
when
i
arrived
general
crook
said
to
me
why
did
you
leave
the
reservation
i
said
you
told
me
that
i
might
live
in
the
reservation
the
same
as
white
people
lived
one
year
i
raised
a
crop
of
corn
and
gathered
and
stored
it
and
the
next
year
i
put
in
a
crop
of
oats
and
when
the
crop
was
almost
ready
to
harvest
you
told
your
soldiers
to
put
me
in
prison
and
if
i
resisted
to
kill
me
if
i
had
been
let
alone
i
would
now
have
been
in
good
circumstances
but
instead
of
that
you
and
the
mexicans
are
hunting
me
with
soldiers
he
said
i
never
gave
any
such
orders
the
troops
at
fort
apache
who
spread
this
report
knew
that
it
was
untrue
then
i
agreed
to
go
back
with
him
to
san
carlos
it
was
hard
for
me
to
believe
him
at
that
time
now
i
know
that
what
he
said
was
untrue
and
i
firmly
believe
that
he
did
issue
the
orders
for
me
to
be
put
in
prison
or
to
be
killed
in
case
i
offered
resistance

the
final
struggle
we
started
with
all
our
tribe
to
go
with
general
crook
back
to
the
united
states
but
i
feared
treachery
and
decided
to
remain
in
mexico
we
were
not
under
any
guard
at
this
time
the
united
states
troops
marched
in
front
and
the
indians
followed
and
when
we
became
suspicious
we
turned
back
i
do
not
know
how
far
the
united
states
army
went
after
myself
and
some
warriors
turned
back
before
we
were
missed
and
i
do
not
care
i
have
suffered
much
from
such
unjust
orders
as
those
of
general
crook
such
acts
have
caused
much
distress
to
my
people
i
think
that
general
crook
death
was
sent
by
the
almighty
as
a
punishment
for
the
many
evil
deeds
he
committed
soon
general
miles
was
made
commander
of
all
the
western
posts
and
troops
trailed
us
continually
they
were
led
by
captain
lawton
who
had
good
scouts
the
mexican
soldiers
also
became
more
active
and
more
numerous
we
had
skirmishes
almost
every
day
and
so
we
finally
decided
to
break
up
into
small
bands
with
six
men
and
four
women
i
made
for
the
range
of
mountains
near
hot
springs
new
mexico
we
passed
many
cattle
ranches
but
had
no
trouble
with
the
cowboys
we
killed
cattle
to
eat
whenever
we
were
in
need
of
food
but
we
frequently
suffered
greatly
for
water
at
one
time
we
had
no
water
for
two
days
and
nights
and
our
horses
almost
died
from
thirst
we
ranged
in
the
mountains
of
new
mexico
for
some
time
then
thinking
that
perhaps
the
troops
had
left
mexico
we
returned
on
our
return
through
old
mexico
we
attacked
every
mexican
found
even
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
kill
we
believed
they
had
asked
the
united
states
troops
to
come
down
to
mexico
to
fight
us
south
of
casa
grande
near
a
place
called
by
the
indians
gosoda
there
was
a
road
leading
out
from
the
town
there
was
much
freighting
carried
on
by
the
mexicans
over
this
road
where
the
road
ran
through
a
mountain
pass
we
stayed
in
hiding
and
whenever
mexican
freighters
passed
we
killed
them
took
what
supplies
we
wanted
and
destroyed
the
remainder
we
were
reckless
of
our
lives
because
we
felt
that
every
man
hand
was
against
us
if
we
returned
to
the
reservation
we
would
be
put
in
prison
and
killed
if
we
stayed
in
mexico
they
would
continue
to
send
soldiers
to
fight
us
so
we
gave
no
quarter
to
anyone
and
asked
no
favors
after
some
time
we
left
gosoda
and
soon
were
reunited
with
our
tribe
in
the
sierra
de
antunez
mountains
contrary
to
our
expectations
the
united
states
soldiers
had
not
left
the
mountains
in
mexico
and
were
soon
trailing
us
and
skirmishing
with
us
almost
every
day
four
or
five
times
they
surprised
our
camp
one
time
they
surprised
us
about
nine
in
the
morning
and
captured
all
our
horses
nineteen
in
number
and
secured
our
store
of
dried
meats
we
also
lost
three
indians
in
this
encounter
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
we
attacked
them
from
the
rear
as
they
were
passing
through
a
prairie
killed
one
soldier
but
lost
none
ourselves
in
this
skirmish
we
recovered
all
our
horses
except
three
that
belonged
to
me
the
three
horses
that
we
did
not
recover
were
the
best
riding
horses
we
had
soon
after
this
we
made
a
treaty
with
the
mexican
troops
they
told
us
that
the
united
states
troops
were
the
real
cause
of
these
wars
and
agreed
not
to
fight
any
more
with
us
provided
we
would
return
to
the
united
states
this
we
agreed
to
do
and
resumed
our
march
expecting
to
try
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
soldiers
and
return
to
arizona
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
course
to
pursue
soon
after
this
scouts
from
captain
lawton
troops
told
us
that
he
wished
to
make
a
treaty
with
us
but
i
knew
that
general
miles
was
the
chief
of
the
american
troops
and
i
decided
to
treat
with
him
we
continued
to
move
our
camp
northward
and
the
american
troops
also
moved
northward
keeping
at
no
great
distance
from
us
but
not
attacking
us
i
sent
my
brother
porico
white
horse
with
george
wratton
on
to
fort
bowie
to
see
general
miles
and
to
tell
him
that
we
wished
to
return
to
arizona
but
before
these
messengers
returned
i
met
two
indian
scouts
kayitah
a
chokonen
apache
and
marteen
a
nedni
apache
they
were
serving
as
scouts
for
captain
lawton
troops
they
told
me
that
general
miles
had
come
and
had
sent
them
to
ask
me
to
meet
him
so
i
went
to
the
camp
of
the
united
states
troops
to
meet
general
miles
when
i
arrived
at
their
camp
i
went
directly
to
general
miles
and
told
him
how
i
had
been
wronged
and
that
i
wanted
to
return
to
the
united
states
with
my
people
as
we
wished
to
see
our
families
who
had
been
captured
and
taken
away
from
us
general
miles
said
to
me
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
sent
me
to
speak
to
you
he
has
heard
of
your
trouble
with
the
white
men
and
says
that
if
you
will
agree
to
a
few
words
of
treaty
we
need
have
no
more
trouble
geronimo
if
you
will
agree
to
a
few
words
of
treaty
all
will
be
satisfactorily
arranged
illustration
gotebo
war
chief
kiowa
indians
so
general
miles
told
me
how
we
could
be
brothers
to
each
other
we
raised
our
hands
to
heaven
and
said
that
the
treaty
was
not
to
be
broken
we
took
an
oath
not
to
do
any
wrong
to
each
other
or
to
scheme
against
each
other
then
he
talked
with
me
for
a
long
time
and
told
me
what
he
would
do
for
me
in
the
future
if
i
would
agree
to
the
treaty
i
did
not
greatly
believe
general
miles
but
because
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
sent
me
word
i
agreed
to
make
the
treaty
and
to
keep
it
then
i
asked
general
miles
what
the
treaty
would
be
general
miles
said
to
me
i
will
take
you
under
government
protection
i
will
build
you
a
house
i
will
fence
you
much
land
i
will
give
you
cattle
horses
mules
and
farming
implements
you
will
be
furnished
with
men
to
work
the
farm
for
you
yourself
will
not
have
to
work
in
the
fall
i
will
send
you
blankets
and
clothing
so
that
you
will
not
suffer
from
cold
in
the
winter
time
there
is
plenty
of
timber
water
and
grass
in
the
land
to
which
i
will
send
you
you
will
live
with
your
tribe
and
with
your
family
if
you
agree
to
this
treaty
you
shall
see
your
family
within
five
days
i
said
to
general
miles
all
the
officers
that
have
been
in
charge
of
the
indians
have
talked
that
way
and
it
sounds
like
a
story
to
me
i
hardly
believe
you
he
said
this
time
it
is
the
truth
i
said
general
miles
i
do
not
know
the
laws
of
the
white
man
nor
of
this
new
country
where
you
are
to
send
me
and
i
might
break
their
laws
he
said
while
i
live
you
will
not
be
arrested
then
i
agreed
to
make
the
treaty
since
i
have
been
a
prisoner
of
war
i
have
been
arrested
and
placed
in
the
guardhouse
twice
for
drinking
whisky
we
stood
between
his
troopers
and
my
warriors
we
placed
a
large
stone
on
the
blanket
before
us
our
treaty
was
made
by
this
stone
and
it
was
to
last
until
the
stone
should
crumble
to
dust
so
we
made
the
treaty
and
bound
each
other
with
an
oath
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
ever
violated
that
treaty
but
general
miles
never
fulfilled
his
promises
when
we
had
made
the
treaty
general
miles
said
to
me
my
brother
you
have
in
your
mind
how
you
are
going
to
kill
men
and
other
thoughts
of
war
i
want
you
to
put
that
out
of
your
mind
and
change
your
thoughts
to
peace
then
i
agreed
and
gave
up
my
arms
i
said
i
will
quit
the
warpath
and
live
at
peace
hereafter
then
general
miles
swept
a
spot
of
ground
clear
with
his
hand
and
said
your
past
deeds
shall
be
wiped
out
like
this
and
you
will
start
a
new
life

this

the

persistent
efforts

be
required

all
officers

soldiers
until
the
object
is
accomplished
a
sufficient
number
of
reliable
indians
will
be
used
as
auxiliaries
to
discover
any
signs

as
trailers

avoid
any
advantage

indians
may
have
by
a
relay
of
horses
where
a
troop

commander
is
near

will
be
justified
in
dismounting

selecting
the

best
riders
to
make
pursuit

it

reduced

they
regarded

which
took
place
at

his

palm
open
and

he
marked

across
it
with
the
finger
of
the

hand
and
said
pointing
to
his
open
palm
represents
the
past

ridges

his

the

his

committing
depredations
now
in

capturing

a
quantity

the
usual
series
of
outrages
with
fatiguing
chase
by
troops
continued
until
june
when
the
mexicans
engaged
the
hostiles
about
miles
southeast
of
magdalena
mexico
and
after
a
stubborn
fight
repulsed
them
about
the
middle
of
august
geronimo
and
his
band
were
so
reduced
and
harassed
by
the
tireless
pursuit
of
the
soldiers
that
they
made
offer
of
surrender
to
the
mexicans
but
without
coming
to
terms
their
locality
thus
being
definitely
known
disposition
of
the
troops
was
rapidly
made
to
act
in
conjunction
with
the
mexicans
to
intercept
geronimo
and
force
his
surrender
on
august
geronimo
when
near
fronteraz
mexico
recognizing
that
he
was
pretty
well
surrounded
and
being
out
of
ammunition
and
food
made
overtures
of
capitulation
through
lieutenant
gatewood
sixth
cavalry
to
captain
lawton
he
desired
certain
terms
but
was
informed
that
a
surrender
as
prisoner
of
war
was
all
that
would
be
accepted
the
indians
then
proceeded
to
the
vicinity
of
captain
command
near
skeleton
cañon
and
sent
word
that
they
wished
to
see
general
miles
on
september
general
miles
arrived
at
lawton
camp
and
on
september
naiche
the
son
of
cochise
and
the
hereditary
chief
of
the
apaches
with
geronimo
surrendered
all
the
hostiles
with
the
understanding
it
seems
that
they
should
be
sent
out
of
arizona
i
am
not
informed
of
the
exact
nature
of
this
surrender
at
first
deemed
unconditional
i
am
sir
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
howard
major
general
united
states
army
of
melton
anadarko
from
to
i
lived
in
southern
arizona
and
was
employed
by
the
sansimone
cattle
company
in
i
was
stationed
in
skeleton
cañon
about
miles
north
of
the
boundary
line
between
arizona
and
old
mexico
with
prewitt
it
was
our
duty
to
ride
the
lines
south
of
our
range
and
keep
the
cattle
of
the
company
from
straying
into
old
mexico
one
afternoon
when
returning
from
our
ride
we
discovered
an
indian
trail
leading
toward
our
camp
we
rode
hurriedly
out
of
the
hills
into
a
broad
valley
so
that
we
could
better
discover
any
attacking
parties
of
apaches
and
if
assailed
have
at
least
a
fighting
chance
for
our
lives
we
knew
the
apaches
under
geronimo
were
on
the
warpath
but
they
were
far
down
in
old
mexico
however
our
knowledge
of
the
indians
led
us
to
expect
anything
at
any
time
to
always
be
ready
for
the
worst
when
we
reached
the
valley
we
struck
a
cavalry
trail
also
headed
for
our
camp
this
was
perplexing
for
neither
the
indians
nor
the
soldiers
seemed
to
have
been
riding
fast
and
both
trails
led
toward
our
camp
in
skeleton
cañon
this
cañon
was
a
natural
route
from
old
mexico
to
arizona
and
almost
all
bands
of
indians
as
well
as
detachments
of
united
states
troops
passed
and
repassed
through
this
valley
when
going
to
old
mexico
or
returning
therefrom
but
never
before
had
two
hostile
bands
passed
through
here
at
the
same
time
and
traveling
in
the
same
direction
except
when
one
fled
and
the
other
pursued
what
this
could
mean
was
a
mystery
to
us
could
it
be
that
the
troops
had
not
seen
the
indians
were
the
redskins
trying
to
head
the
troops
off
and
attack
them
in
their
camp
were
the
troops
hunting
for
those
indians
could
this
be
lawton
command
could
that
be
geronimo
band
no
it
was
impossible
then
who
were
these
troops
and
what
indians
were
those
cautiously
we
rode
to
our
camp
and
nailed
on
the
door
of
our
cabin
was
this
notice
be
careful
geronimo
is
near
by
and
has
not
yet
surrendered
capt
lawton
then
we
understood
a
short
distance
above
our
cabin
we
found
the
camp
of
the
troops
and
we
had
just
finished
talking
with
captain
lawton
who
advised
us
to
remain
in
his
camp
rather
than
risk
staying
alone
in
our
cabin
when
up
rode
the
chief
geronimo
he
was
mounted
on
a
dun
horse
he
came
directly
to
captain
lawton
and
through
an
interpreter
asked
who
we
were
and
what
we
wanted
as
soon
as
the
explanation
was
given
he
nodded
his
approval
and
rode
away
prewitt
and
i
rode
away
with
him
we
were
well
armed
and
well
mounted
and
geronimo
was
well
mounted
but
so
far
as
we
could
see
unarmed
i
tried
to
talk
with
the
chief
in
english
but
could
not
make
him
understand
prewitt
wanted
to
shoot
him
and
said
he
could
easily
kill
him
the
first
shot
but
i
objected
and
succeeded
in
restraining
him
while
we
were
arguing
the
chief
rode
silently
between
us
evidently
feeling
perfectly
secure
all
this
time
we
had
been
riding
in
the
direction
of
our
horses
that
were
grazing
in
the
valley
about
a
mile
distant
from
our
corral
when
we
came
to
a
place
about
a
half
mile
from
lawton
camp
where
a
spur
of
the
mountain
ran
far
out
into
the
valley
geronimo
turned
aside
saluted
said
in
fairly
good
spanish
and
began
to
ascend
a
mountain
path
later
we
learned
that
he
was
going
directly
toward
his
camp
far
up
among
the
rocks
we
rode
on
drove
our
horses
back
to
the
corral
and
remained
in
our
cabin
all
night
but
were
not
molested
by
the
indians
the
next
day
we
killed
three
beeves
for
the
indians
and
they
were
paid
for
by
captain
lawton
on
the
second
day
two
mounted
mexican
scouts
came
to
lawton
camp
as
soon
as
these
mexicans
came
in
sight
the
indians
seized
their
arms
and
vanished
as
it
were
among
the
rocks
captain
lawton
wrote
an
account
of
conditions
and
delivered
it
to
the
mexicans
who
withdrew
after
they
had
gone
and
their
mission
had
been
explained
to
geronimo
the
indians
again
returned
to
their
camp
and
laid
down
their
arms
on
the
next
day
word
reached
camp
that
general
miles
was
approaching
and
the
indians
again
armed
and
disappeared
among
the
rocks
many
of
the
apache
squaws
had
field
glasses
and
were
stationed
every
day
on
prominent
mountain
peaks
to
keep
a
lookout
no
one
could
approach
their
camp
or
lawton
camp
without
being
discovered
by
these
spies
soon
after
general
miles
joined
lawton
command
geronimo
rode
into
camp
unarmed
and
dismounting
approached
general
miles
shook
hands
with
him
and
then
stood
proudly
before
the
officers
waiting
for
general
miles
to
begin
conversation
with
him
the
interpreter
said
to
geronimo
general
miles
is
your
friend
geronimo
said
i
never
saw
him
but
i
have
been
in
need
of
friends
why
has
he
not
been
with
me
when
this
answer
was
interpreted
everybody
laughed
after
this
there
was
no
more
formality
and
without
delay
the
discussion
of
the
treaty
was
begun
all
i
remember
distinctly
of
the
treaty
is
that
geronimo
and
his
band
were
not
to
be
killed
but
they
were
to
be
taken
to
their
families
illustration
melton
at
whose
camp
in
skeleton
cañon
geronimo
surrendered
i
remember
this
more
distinctly
because
the
indians
were
so
much
pleased
with
this
particular
one
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
geronimo
naiche
and
a
few
others
went
on
ahead
with
general
miles
but
the
main
band
of
indians
left
under
the
escort
of
lawton
troops
the
night
before
they
left
a
young
squaw
of
geronimo
gave
birth
to
a
child
the
next
morning
the
husband
geronimo
son
carried
the
child
but
the
mother
mounted
her
pony
unaided
and
rode
away
unassisted
a
prisoner
of
war
under
military
escort
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
of
the
treaty
captain
lawton
built
a
monument
about
ten
feet
across
and
six
feet
high
of
rough
stones
at
the
spot
where
the
treaty
was
made
the
next
year
some
cowboys
on
a
camped
at
the
place
and
tore
down
the
monument
to
see
what
was
in
it
all
they
found
was
a
bottle
containing
a
piece
of
paper
upon
which
was
written
the
names
of
the
officers
who
were
with
lawton
after
the
indians
left
we
found
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
cents
in
mexican
money
hidden
in
a
rat
nest
near
where
the
indians
had
camped
about
ten
on
the
morning
after
the
apaches
and
soldiers
had
gone
away
twenty
pimos
indians
accompanied
by
one
white
man
surrounded
our
camp
and
demanded
to
know
of
geronimo
whereabouts
we
told
them
of
the
treaty
and
they
followed
the
trail
on
toward
fort
bowie
that
afternoon
thinking
all
danger
from
apaches
past
my
partner
prewitt
went
to
ride
the
lines
and
i
was
left
in
camp
alone
i
was
pumping
water
by
at
the
well
when
i
saw
three
indians
rounding
up
our
horses
about
half
a
mile
away
they
saw
me
but
did
not
disturb
me
nor
did
i
interfere
with
them
but
as
soon
as
they
had
driven
that
bunch
of
horses
northward
over
the
hill
out
of
sight
i
rode
quickly
off
in
another
direction
and
drove
another
bunch
of
horses
into
the
corral
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
stayed
in
camp
but
saw
no
more
indians
the
next
day
we
rode
over
the
hill
in
the
direction
these
indians
had
gone
and
found
that
they
had
camped
not
three
miles
away
there
were
evidently
several
in
the
party
and
they
had
kept
scouts
concealed
near
the
top
of
the
hill
to
watch
me
and
to
shoot
me
from
ambush
had
i
followed
them
this
we
knew
because
we
saw
behind
some
rocks
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
the
loose
soil
the
imprints
left
by
the
bodies
of
three
warriors
where
they
had
been
lying
down
in
concealment
at
their
camp
we
found
the
head
and
hoofs
of
my
favorite
horse
digger
a
fine
little
sorrel
pony
and
knew
that
he
had
served
them
for
dinner
we
followed
their
trail
far
into
old
mexico
but
did
not
overtake
them
we
had
been
accustomed
to
say
it
was
geronimo
band
whenever
any
depredation
was
committed
but
this
time
we
were
not
so
positive
we
do
not
wish
to
express
our
own
opinion
but
to
ask
the
reader
whether
after
having
had
the
testimony
of
apaches
soldiers
and
civilians
who
knew
the
conditions
of
surrender
and
after
having
examined
carefully
the
testimony
offered
it
would
be
possible
to
conclude
that
geronimo
made
an
unconditional
surrender
before
passing
from
this
subject
it
would
be
well
also
to
consider
whether
our
government
has
treated
these
prisoners
in
strict
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
treaty
made
in
skeleton
cañon

laughed
shyly

other

a
prisoner

when
i
had
given
up
to
the
government
they
put
me
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
took
me
to
san
antonio
texas
and
held
me
to
be

in
forty
days
they
took
me
from
there
to
fort

pensacola

here
they
put
me
to
sawing
up
large
logs
there
were
several
other
apache
warriors
with
me
and
all
of
us
had
to
work
every
day
for
nearly
two
years
we
were
kept
at
hard
labor
in
this
place
and
we
did
not
see
our

until
may
this
treatment
was
in
direct
violation
of

made
at

after
this
we
were
sent
with
our
families
to
vermont
alabama
where
we
stayed
five
years
and
worked
for
the
government
we
had
no
property
and
i
looked
in
vain
for
general
miles
to
send
me
to
that
land
of
which
he
had
spoken
i
longed
in
vain
for
the
implements
house
and
stock
that
general
miles
had
promised
me
during
this
time
one
of
my
warriors
fun
killed
himself
and
his
wife
another
one
shot
his
wife
and
then
shot
himself
he
fell
dead
but
the
woman
recovered
and
is
still
living
we
were
not
healthy
in
this
place
for
the
climate
disagreed
with
us
so
many
of
our
people
died
that
i
consented
to
let
one
of
my
wives
go
to
the
mescalero
agency
in
new
mexico
to
live
this
separation
is
according
to
our
custom
equivalent
to
what
the
white
people
call
divorce
and
so
she
married
again
soon
after
she
got
to
mescalero
she
also
kept
our
two
small
children
which
she
had
a
right
to
do
the
children
lenna
and
robbie
are
still
living
at
mescalero
new
mexico
lenna
is
married
i
kept
one
wife
but
she
is
dead
now
and
i
have
only
our
daughter
eva
with
me
since
my
separation
from
lenna
mother
i
have
never
had
more
than
one
wife
at
a
time
since
the
death
of
eva
mother
i
married
another
woman
december
but
we
could
not
live
happily
and
separated
she
went
home
to
her
people
that
is
an
apache
divorce
then
as
now
george
wratton
superintended
the
indians
he
has
always
had
trouble
with
the
indians
because
he
has
mistreated
them
one
day
an
indian
while
drunk
stabbed
wratton
with
a
little
knife
the
officer
in
charge
took
the
part
of
wratton
and
the
indian
was
sent
to
prison
when
we
first
came
to
fort
sill
captain
scott
was
in
charge
and
he
had
houses
built
for
us
by
the
government
we
were
also
given
from
the
government
cattle
hogs
turkeys
and
chickens
the
indians
did
not
do
much
good
with
the
hogs
because
they
did
not
understand
how
to
care
for
them
and
not
many
indians
even
at
the
present
time
keep
hogs
we
did
better
with
the
turkeys
and
chickens
but
with
these
we
did
not
have
as
good
luck
as
white
men
do
with
the
cattle
we
have
done
very
well
indeed
and
we
like
to
raise
them
we
have
a
few
horses
also
and
have
had
no
bad
luck
with
them
in
the
matter
of
selling
our
stock
and
grain
there
has
been
much
misunderstanding
the
indians
understood
that
the
cattle
were
to
be
sold
and
the
money
given
to
them
but
instead
part
of
the
money
is
given
to
the
indians
and
part
of
it
is
placed
in
what
the
officers
call
the
apache
fund
we
have
had
five
different
officers
in
charge
of
the
indians
here
and
they
have
all
ruled
very
much
alike
not
consulting
the
apaches
or
even
explaining
to
them
it
may
be
that
the
government
ordered
the
officers
in
charge
to
put
this
cattle
money
into
an
apache
fund
for
once
i
complained
and
told
lieutenant
purington
that
i
intended
to
report
to
the
government
that
he
had
taken
some
of
my
part
of
the
cattle
money
and
put
it
into
the
apache
fund
he
said
he
did
not
care
if
i
did
tell
several
years
ago
the
issue
of
clothing
ceased
this
too
may
have
been
by
the
order
of
the
government
but
the
apaches
do
not
understand
it
if
there
is
an
apache
fund
it
should
some
day
be
turned
over
to
the
indians
or
at
least
they
should
have
an
account
of
it
for
it
is
their
earnings
when
general
miles
last
visited
fort
sill
i
asked
to
be
relieved
from
labor
on
account
of
my
age
i
also
remembered
what
general
miles
had
promised
me
in
the
treaty
and
told
him
of
it
he
said
i
need
not
work
any
more
except
when
i
wished
to
and
since
that
time
i
have
not
been
detailed
to
do
any
work
i
have
worked
a
great
deal
however
since
then
for
although
i
am
old
i
like
to
work
and
help
my
people
as
much
as
i
am
able
footnotes
these
are
not
the
words
of
the

but
of
geronimo
they
were
in
alabama
from
may
to
october
the
indians
are
not
allowed
to
sell
the
cattle
themselves
when
cattle
are
ready
for
market
they
are
sold
by
the

part
of

it

the

are
paid
for
from
this

the
criticism
of
lieutenant
purington
is
from

the

disclaims
any
responsibility
for
it

in
all
cases
where

are

the
old

chapter
xx
unwritten
laws
of
the
apaches
when
an
indian
has
been
wronged
by
a
member
of
his
tribe
he
may
if
he
does
not
wish
to
settle
the
difficulty
personally
make
complaint
to
the
chieftain
if
he
is
unable
to
meet
the
offending
parties
in
a
personal
encounter
and
disdains
to
make
complaint
anyone
may
in
his
stead
inform
the
chief
of
this
conduct
and
then
it
becomes
necessary
to
have
an
investigation
or
trial
both
the
accused
and
the
accuser
are
entitled
to
witnesses
and
their
witnesses
are
not
interrupted
in
any
way
by
questions
but
simply
say
what
they
wish
to
say
in
regard
to
the
matter
the
witnesses
are
not
placed
under
oath
because
it
is
not
believed
that
they
will
give
false
testimony
in
a
matter
relating
to
their
own
people
the
chief
of
the
tribe
presides
during
these
trials
but
if
it
is
a
serious
offense
he
asks
two
or
three
leaders
to
sit
with
him
these
simply
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
is
guilty
if
he
is
not
guilty
the
matter
is
ended
and
the
complaining
party
has
forfeited
his
right
to
take
personal
vengeance
for
if
he
wishes
to
take
vengeance
himself
he
must
object
to
the
trial
which
would
prevent
it
if
the
accused
is
found
guilty
the
injured
party
fixes
the
penalty
which
is
generally
confirmed
by
the
chief
and
his
associates
of
if
any
children
are
left
orphans
by
the
usage
of
war
or
otherwise
that
is
if
both
parents
are
dead
the
chief
of
the
tribe
may
adopt
them
or
give
them
away
as
he
desires
in
the
case
of
outlawed
indians
they
may
if
they
wish
take
their
children
with
them
but
if
they
leave
the
children
with
the
tribe
the
chief
decides
what
will
be
done
with
them
but
no
disgrace
attaches
to
the
children
salt
lake
we
obtained
our
salt
from
a
little
lake
in
the
gila
mountains
this
is
a
very
small
lake
of
clear
shallow
water
and
in
the
center
a
small
mound
arises
above
the
surface
of
the
water
the
water
is
too
salty
to
drink
and
the
bottom
of
the
lake
is
covered
with
a
brown
crust
when
this
crust
is
broken
cakes
of
salt
adhere
to
it
these
cakes
of
salt
may
be
washed
clear
in
the
water
of
this
lake
but
if
washed
in
other
water
will
dissolve
when
visiting
this
lake
our
people
were
not
allowed
to
even
kill
game
or
attack
an
enemy
all
creatures
were
free
to
go
and
come
without
molestation
of
a
to
be
admitted
as
a
warrior
a
youth
must
have
gone
with
the
warriors
of
his
tribe
four
separate
times
on
the
warpath
on
the
first
trip
he
will
be
given
only
very
inferior
food
with
this
he
must
be
contented
without
murmuring
on
none
of
the
four
trips
is
he
allowed
to
select
his
food
as
the
warriors
do
but
must
eat
such
food
as
he
is
permitted
to
have
on
each
of
these
expeditions
he
acts
as
servant
cares
for
the
horses
cooks
the
food
and
does
whatever
duties
he
should
do
without
being
told
he
knows
what
things
are
to
be
done
and
without
waiting
to
be
told
is
to
do
them
he
is
not
allowed
to
speak
to
any
warrior
except
in
answer
to
questions
or
when
told
to
speak
during
these
four
wars
he
is
expected
to
learn
the
sacred
names
of
everything
used
in
war
for
after
the
tribe
enters
upon
the
warpath
no
common
names
are
used
in
referring
to
anything
appertaining
to
war
in
any
way
war
is
a
solemn
religious
matter
if
after
four
expeditions
all
the
warriors
are
satisfied
that
the
youth
has
been
industrious
has
not
spoken
out
of
order
has
been
discreet
in
all
things
has
shown
courage
in
battle
has
borne
all
hardships
uncomplainingly
and
has
exhibited
no
color
of
cowardice
or
weakness
of
any
kind
he
may
by
vote
of
the
council
be
admitted
as
a
warrior
but
if
any
warrior
objects
to
him
upon
any
account
he
will
be
subjected
to
further
tests
and
if
he
meets
these
courageously
his
name
may
again
be
proposed
when
he
has
proven
beyond
question
that
he
can
bear
hardships
without
complaint
and
that
he
is
a
stranger
to
fear
he
is
admitted
to
the
council
of
the
warriors
in
the
lowest
rank
after
this
there
is
no
formal
test
for
promotions
but
by
common
consent
he
assumes
a
station
on
the
battlefield
and
if
that
position
is
maintained
with
honor
he
is
allowed
to
keep
it
and
may
be
asked
or
may
volunteer
to
take
a
higher
station
but
no
warrior
would
presume
to
take
a
higher
station
unless
he
had
assurance
from
the
leaders
of
the
tribe
that
his
conduct
in
the
first
position
was
worthy
of
commendation
from
this
point
upward
the
only
election
by
the
council
in
formal
assembly
is
the
election
of
the
chief

men
are
not
allowed
to

their

all
dances
are
considered
religious
ceremonies

are
presided
over
by
a

are

military
nature

we
would
gather
the
fruit
of
the
yucca

and
pulverize
it

it

the

would
be
assembled

to
give
praises

thanksgiving
were
said
by

and

war
after
a
council
of
the
warriors
had
deliberated
and
had
prepared
for
the
warpath
the
dance
would
be
started
in
this
dance
there
is
the
usual
singing
led
by
the
warriors
and
accompanied
with
the
beating
of
the
esadadene
but
the
dancing
is
more
violent
and
yells
and
war
whoops
sometimes
almost
drown
the
music
only
warriors
participated
in
this
dance
after
a
war
party
has
returned
a
modification
of
the
war
dance
is
held
the
warriors
who
have
brought
scalps
from
the
battles
exhibit
them
to
the
tribe
and
when
the
dance
begins
these
scalps
elevated
on
poles
or
spears
are
carried
around
the
camp
fires
while
the
dance
is
in
progress
during
this
dance
there
is
still
some
of
the
solemnity
of
the
war
dance
there
are
yells
and
war
whoops
frequently
accompanied
by
discharge
of
firearms
but
there
is
always
more
levity
than
would
be
permitted
at
a
war
dance
after
the
scalp
dance
is
over
the
scalps
are
thrown
away
no
apache
would
keep
them
for
they
are
considered
defiling
social
in
the
early
part
of
september
i
announced
among
the
apaches
that
my
daughter
eva
having
attained
womanhood
should
now
put
away
childish
things
and
assume
her
station
as
a
young
lady
at
a
dance
of
the
tribe
she
would
make
her
début
and
then
or
thereafter
it
would
be
proper
for
a
warrior
to
seek
her
hand
in
marriage
accordingly
invitations
were
issued
to
all
apaches
and
many
comanches
and
kiowas
to
assemble
for
a
grand
dance
on
the
green
by
the
south
bank
of
medicine
creek
near
the
village
of
naiche
former
chief
of
the
chokonen
apaches
on
the
first
night
of
full
moon
in
september
the
festivities
were
to
continue
for
two
days
and
nights
nothing
was
omitted
in
the
preparation
that
would
contribute
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
guests
or
the
perfection
of
the
observance
of
the
religious
rite
to
make
ready
for
the
dancing
the
grass
on
a
large
circular
space
was
closely
mowed
the
singing
was
led
by
chief
naiche
and
i
assisted
by
our
medicine
men
directed
the
dance
first
eva
advanced
from
among
the
women
and
danced
once
around
the
camp
fire
then
accompanied
by
another
young
woman
she
again
advanced
and
both
danced
twice
around
the
camp
fire
then
she
and
two
other
young
ladies
advanced
and
danced
three
times
around
the
camp
fire
the
next
time
she
and
three
other
young
ladies
advanced
and
danced
four
times
around
the
camp
fire
this
ceremony
lasted
about
one
hour
next
the
medicine
men
entered
stripped
to
the
waist
their
bodies
painted
fantastically
and
danced
the
sacred
dances
they
were
followed
by
clown
dancers
who
amused
the
audience
greatly
then
the
members
of
the
tribe
joined
hands
and
danced
in
a
circle
around
the
camp
fire
for
a
long
time
all
the
friends
of
the
tribe
were
asked
to
take
part
in
this
dance
and
when
it
was
ended
many
of
the
old
people
retired
and
the
lovers
dance
began
the
warriors
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
the
ladies
danced
forward
and
designated
some
warrior
to
dance
with
them
the
dancing
was
back
and
forth
on
a
line
from
the
center
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
the
warrior
faced
the
two
ladies
and
when
they
danced
forward
to
the
center
he
danced
backward
then
they
danced
backward
to
the
outer
edge
and
he
followed
facing
them
this
lasted
two
or
three
hours
and
then
the
music
changed
immediately
the
warriors
assembled
again
in
the
center
of
the
circle
and
this
time
each
lady
selected
a
warrior
as
a
partner
the
manner
of
dancing
was
as
before
only
two
instead
of
three
danced
together
during
this
dance
which
continued
until
daylight
the
warrior
if
dancing
with
a
maiden
could
propose
marriage
and
if
the
maiden
agreed
he
would
consult
her
father
soon
afterward
and
make
a
bargain
for
her
upon
all
such
occasions
as
this
when
the
dance
is
finished
each
warrior
gives
a
present
to
the
lady
who
selected
him
for
a
partner
and
danced
with
him
if
she
is
satisfied
with
the
present
he
says
if
not
the
matter
is
referred
to
someone
in
authority
medicine
man
or
chief
who
determines
the
question
of
what
is
a
proper
gift
for
a
married
lady
the
value
of
the
present
should
be
two
or
three
dollars
for
a
maiden
the
present
should
have
a
value
of
not
less
than
five
dollars
often
however
the
maiden
receives
a
very
valuable
present
during
the
lovers
dance
the
medicine
men
mingle
with
the
dancers
to
keep
out
evil
spirits
perhaps
i
shall
never
again
have
cause
to
assemble
our
people
to
dance
but
these
social
dances
in
the
moonlight
have
been
a
large
part
of
our
enjoyment
in
the
past
and
i
think
they
will
not
soon
be
discontinued
at
least
i
hope
not
footnote
apache
warriors
do
not
go
courting
as
our
youths
do
the
associations
in
the
villages
afford
ample
opportunity
for
acquaintance
and
the
arranging
for
marriages
is
considered
a
business
transaction
but
the
courtesy
of
consulting
the
maiden
although
not
essential
is
considered
very
polite

fair
when
i
was
at
first
asked
to
attend
the
louis
world
fair
i
did
not
wish
to
go
later
when
i
was
told
that
i
would
receive
good
attention
and
protection
and
that
the
president

said
that
it
would

might

kept

money

often
made

much

i
returned
i
had
plenty

money
more

i
had
ever
owned

invited
me
to
come
to
their
homes
but
my
keeper
always
refused
every
sunday
the
president
of
the
fair
sent
for
me
to
go
to
a
wild
west
show
i
took
part
in
the
roping
contests
before
the
audience
there
were
many
other
indian
tribes
there
and
strange
people
of
whom
i
had
never
heard
when
people
first
came
to
the
world
fair
they
did
nothing
but
parade
up
and
down
the
streets
when
they
got
tired
of
this
they
would
visit
the
shows
there
were
many
strange
things
in
these
shows
the
government
sent
guards
with
me
when
i
went
and
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
anywhere
without
them
in
one
of
the
shows
some
strange
men
with
red
caps
had
some
peculiar
swords
and
they
seemed
to
want
to
fight
finally
their
manager
told
them
they
might
fight
each
other
they
tried
to
hit
each
other
over
the
head
with
these
swords
and
i
expected
both
to
be
wounded
or
perhaps
killed
but
neither
one
was
harmed
they
would
be
hard
people
to
kill
in
a
fight
in
another
show
there
was
a
negro
the
manager
tied
his
hands
fast
then
tied
him
to
a
chair
he
was
securely
tied
for
i
looked
myself
and
i
did
not
think
it
was
possible
for
him
to
get
away
then
the
manager
told
him
to
get
loose
he
twisted
in
his
chair
for
a
moment
and
then
stood
up
the
ropes
were
still
tied
but
he
was
free
i
do
not
understand
how
this
was
done
it
was
certainly
a
miraculous
power
because
no
man
could
have
released
himself
by
his
own
efforts
in
another
place
a
man
was
on
a
platform
speaking
to
the
audience
they
set
a
basket
by
the
side
of
the
platform
and
covered
it
with
red
calico
then
a
woman
came
and
got
into
the
basket
and
a
man
covered
the
basket
again
with
the
calico
then
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
the
audience
took
a
long
sword
and
ran
it
through
the
basket
each
way
and
then
down
through
the
cloth
cover
i
heard
the
sword
cut
through
the
woman
body
and
the
manager
himself
said
she
was
dead
but
when
the
cloth
was
lifted
from
the
basket
she
stepped
out
smiled
and
walked
off
the
stage
i
would
like
to
know
how
she
was
so
quickly
healed
and
why
the
wounds
did
not
kill
her
i
have
never
considered
bears
very
intelligent
except
in
their
wild
habits
but
i
had
never
before
seen
a
white
bear
in
one
of
the
shows
a
man
had
a
white
bear
that
was
as
intelligent
as
a
man
he
would
do
whatever
he
was
told
carry
a
log
on
his
shoulder
just
as
a
man
would
then
when
he
was
told
would
put
it
down
again
he
did
many
other
things
and
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
his
keeper
said
to
him
i
am
sure
that
no
grizzly
bear
could
be
trained
to
do
these
things

one
time
the
guards
took
me
into
a
little
house
that
had
four
windows
when
we
were
seated
the
little
house
started
to
move
along
the
ground
then
the
guards
called
my
attention
to
some
curious
things
they
had
in
their
pockets
finally
they
told
me
to
look
out
and
when
i
did
so
i
was
scared
for
our
little
house
had
gone
high
up
in
the
air
and
the
people
down
in
the
fair
grounds
looked
no
larger
than
ants
the
men
laughed
at
me
for
being
scared
then
they
gave
me
a
glass
to
look
through
i
often
had
such
glasses
which
i
took
from
dead
officers
after
battles
in
mexico
and
elsewhere
and
i
could
see
rivers
lakes
and
mountains
but
i
had
never
been
so
high
in
the
air
and
i
tried
to
look
into
the
sky
there
were
no
stars
and
i
could
not
look
at
the
sun
through
this
glass
because
the
brightness
hurt
my
eyes
finally
i
put
the
glass
down
and
as
they
were
all
laughing
at
me
i
too
began
to
laugh
then
they
said
get
out
and
when
i
looked
we
were
on
the
street
again
after
we
were
safe
on
the
land
i
watched
many
of
these
little
houses
going
up
and
coming
down
but
i
can
not
understand
how
they
travel
they
are
very
curious
little
houses
one
day
we
went
into
another
show
and
as
soon
as
we
were
in
it
changed
into
night
it
was
real
night
for
i
could
feel
the
damp
air
soon
it
began
to
thunder
and
the
lightnings
flashed
it
was
real
lightning
too
for
it
struck
just
above
our
heads
i
dodged
and
wanted
to
run
away
but
i
could
not
tell
which
way
to
go
in
order
to
get
out
the
guards
motioned
me
to
keep
still
and
so
i
stayed
in
front
of
us
were
some
strange
little
people
who
came
out
on
the
platform
then
i
looked
up
again
and
the
clouds
were
all
gone
and
i
could
see
the
stars
shining
the
little
people
on
the
platform
did
not
seem
in
earnest
about
anything
they
did
so
i
only
laughed
at
them
all
the
people
around
where
we
sat
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
me
we
went
into
another
place
and
the
manager
took
us
into
a
little
room
that
was
made
like
a
cage
then
everything
around
us
seemed
to
be
moving
soon
the
air
looked
blue
then
there
were
black
clouds
moving
with
the
wind
pretty
soon
it
was
clear
outside
then
we
saw
a
few
thin
white
clouds
then
the
clouds
grew
thicker
and
it
rained
and
hailed
with
thunder
and
lightning
then
the
thunder
retreated
and
a
rainbow
appeared
in
the
distance
then
it
became
dark
the
moon
rose
and
thousands
of
stars
came
out
soon
the
sun
came
up
and
we
got
out
of
the
little
room
this
was
a
good
show
but
it
was
so
strange
and
unnatural
that
i
was
glad
to
be
on
the
streets
again
we
went
into
one
place
where
they
made
glassware
i
had
always
thought
that
these
things
were
made
by
hand
but
they
are
not
the
man
had
a
curious
little
instrument
and
whenever
he
would
blow
through
this
into
a
little
blaze
the
glass
would
take
any
shape
he
wanted
it
to
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
that
if
i
had
this
kind
of
an
instrument
i
could
make
whatever
i
wished
there
seems
to
be
a
charm
about
it
but
i
suppose
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
these
little
instruments
or
other
people
would
have
them
the
people
in
this
show
were
so
anxious
to
buy
the
things
the
man
made
that
they
kept
him
so
busy
he
could
not
sit
down
all
day
long
i
bought
many
curious
things
in
there
and
brought
them
home
with
me
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
streets
some
people
were
getting
into
a
clumsy
canoe
upon
a
kind
of
shelf
and
sliding
down
into
the
water
they
seemed
to
enjoy
it
but
it
looked
too
fierce
for
me
if
one
of
these
canoes
had
gone
out
of
its
path
the
people
would
have
been
sure
to
get
hurt
or
killed
there
were
some
little
brown
people
at
the
fair
that
united
states
troops
captured
recently
on
some
islands
far
away
from
here
they
did
not
wear
much
clothing
and
i
think
that
they
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
come
to
the
fair
but
they
themselves
did
not
seem
to
know
any
better
they
had
some
little
brass
plates
and
they
tried
to
play
music
with
these
but
i
did
not
think
it
was
music
it
was
only
a
rattle
however
they
danced
to
this
noise
and
seemed
to
think
they
were
giving
a
fine
show
i
do
not
know
how
true
the
report
was
but
i
heard
that
the
president
sent
them
to
the
fair
so
that
they
could
learn
some
manners
and
when
they
went
home
teach
their
people
how
to
dress
and
how
to
behave
i
am
glad
i
went
to
the
fair
i
saw
many
interesting
things
and
learned
much
of
the
white
people
they
are
a
very
kind
and
peaceful
people
during
all
the
time
i
was
at
the
fair
no
one
tried
to
harm
me
in
any
way
had
this
been
among
the
mexicans
i
am
sure
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
defend
myself
often
i
wish
all
my
people
could
have

during

religion
in
our
primitive
worship
only
our
relations
to
usen
and
the
members
of
our
tribe
were
considered
as
appertaining
to
our
religious
responsibilities
as
to
the
future
state
the
teachings
of
our
tribe
were
not
specific
that
is
we
had
no
definite
idea
of
our
relations
and
surroundings
in
after
life
we
believed
that
there
is
a
life
after
this
one
but
no
one
ever
told
me
as
to
what
part
of
man
lived
after
death
i
have
seen
many
men
die
i
have
seen
many
human
bodies
decayed
but
i
have
never
seen
that
part
which
is
called
the
spirit
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
nor
have
i
yet
been
able
to
understand
that
part
of
the
christian
religion
we
held
that
the
discharge
of
one
duty
would
make
his
future
life
more
pleasant
but
whether
that
future
life
was
worse
than
this
life
or
better
we
did
not
know
and
no
one
was
able
to
tell
us
we
hoped
that
in
the
future
life
family
and
tribal
relations
would
be
resumed
in
a
way
we
believed
this
but
we
did
not
know
it
once
when
living
in
san
carlos
reservation
an
indian
told
me
that
while
lying
unconscious
on
the
battlefield
he
had
actually
been
dead
and
had
passed
into
the
spirit
land
first
he
came
to
a
mulberry
tree
growing
out
from
a
cave
in
the
ground
before
this
cave
a
guard
was
stationed
but
when
he
approached
without
fear
the
guard
let
him
pass
he
descended
into
the
cave
and
a
little
way
back
the
path
widened
and
terminated
in
a
perpendicular
rock
many
hundreds
of
feet
wide
and
equal
in
height
there
was
not
much
light
but
by
peering
directly
beneath
him
he
discovered
a
pile
of
sand
reaching
from
the
depths
below
to
within
twenty
feet
of
the
top
of
the
rock
where
he
stood
holding
to
a
bush
he
swung
off
from
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
dropped
onto
the
sand
sliding
rapidly
down
its
steep
side
into
the
darkness
he
landed
in
a
narrow
passage
running
due
westward
through
a
cañon
which
gradually
grew
lighter
and
lighter
until
he
could
see
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
daylight
but
there
was
no
sun
finally
he
came
to
a
section
of
this
passage
that
was
wider
for
a
short
distance
and
then
closing
abruptly
continued
in
a
narrow
path
just
where
this
section
narrowed
two
huge
serpents
were
coiled
and
rearing
their
heads
hissed
at
him
as
he
approached
but
he
showed
no
fear
and
as
soon
as
he
came
close
to
them
they
withdrew
quietly
and
let
him
pass
at
the
next
place
where
the
passage
opened
into
a
wider
section
were
two
grizzly
bears
prepared
to
attack
him
but
when
he
approached
and
spoke
to
them
they
stood
aside
and
he
passed
unharmed
he
continued
to
follow
the
narrow
passage
and
the
third
time
it
widened
and
two
mountain
lions
crouched
in
the
way
but
when
he
had
approached
them
without
fear
and
had
spoken
to
them
they
also
withdrew
he
again
entered
the
narrow
passage
for
some
time
he
followed
this
emerging
into
a
fourth
section
beyond
which
he
could
see
nothing
the
further
walls
of
this
section
were
clashing
together
at
regular
intervals
with
tremendous
sounds
but
when
he
approached
them
they
stood
apart
until
he
had
passed
after
this
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
forest
and
following
the
natural
draws
which
led
westward
soon
came
into
a
green
valley
where
there
were
many
indians
camped
and
plenty
of
game
he
said
that
he
saw
and
recognized
many
whom
he
had
known
in
this
life
and
that
he
was
sorry
when
he
was
brought
back
to
consciousness
i
told
him
if
i
knew
this
to
be
true
i
would
not
want
to
live
another
day
but
by
some
means
if
by
my
own
hands
i
would
die
in
order
to
enjoy
these
pleasures
i
myself
have
lain
unconscious
on
the
battlefield
and
while
in
that
condition
have
had
some
strange
thoughts
or
experiences
but
they
are
very
dim
and
i
can
not
recall
them
well
enough
to
relate
them
many
indians
believed
this
warrior
and
i
can
not
say
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
i
wish
i
knew
that
what
he
said
is
beyond
question
true
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
we
are
not
certain
illustration
ready
for
church
since
my
life
as
a
prisoner
has
begun
i
have
heard
the
teachings
of
the
white
man
religion
and
in
many
respects
believe
it
to
be
better
than
the
religion
of
my
fathers
however
i
have
always
prayed
and
i
believe
that
the
almighty
has
always
protected
me
believing
that
in
a
wise
way
it
is
good
to
go
to
church
and
that
associating
with
christians
would
improve
my
character
i
have
adopted
the
christian
religion
i
believe
that
the
church
has
helped
me
much
during
the
short
time
i
have
been
a
member
i
am
not
ashamed
to
be
a
christian
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
a
christian
for
without
the
help
of
the
almighty
i
do
not
think
he
could
rightly
judge
in
ruling
so
many
people
i
have
advised
all
of
my
people
who
are
not
christians
to
study
that
religion
because
it
seems
to
me
the
best
religion
in
enabling
one
to
live

there
is
a
great
question
between
the
apaches
and
the
government
for
twenty
years
we
have
been
held
prisoners
of
war
under
a
treaty
which
was
made
with
general
miles
on
the
part
of
the
united

government
and
myself
as
the
representative
of
the
apaches
that
treaty
has
not
at
all
times
been
properly
observed
by
the
government
although
at
the
present
time
it
is
being
more
nearly
fulfilled
on
their
part
than
heretofore
in
the
treaty
with
general
miles
we
agreed
to
go
to
a
place
outside
of
arizona
and
learn
to
live
as
the
white
people
do
i
think
that
my
people
are
now
capable
of
living
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
we
would
of
course
like
to
have
the
liberty
to
return
to
that
land
which
is
ours
by
divine
right
we
are
reduced
in
numbers
and
having
learned
how
to
cultivate
the
soil
would
not
require
so
much
ground
as
was
formerly
necessary
we
do
not
ask
all
of
the
land
which
the
almighty
gave
us
in
the
beginning
but
that
we
may
have
sufficient
lands
there
to
cultivate
what
we
do
not
need
we
are
glad
for
the
white
men
to
cultivate
we
are
now
held
on
comanche
and
kiowa
lands
which
are
not
suited
to
our
needs
these
lands
and
this
climate
are
suited
to
the
indians
who
originally
inhabited
this
country
of
course
but
our
people
are
decreasing
in
numbers
here
and
will
continue
to
decrease
unless
they
are
allowed
to
return
to
their
native
land
such
a
result
is
inevitable
there
is
no
climate
or
soil
which
to
my
mind
is
equal
to
that
of
arizona
we
could
have
plenty
of
good
cultivating
land
plenty
of
grass
plenty
of
timber
and
plenty
of
minerals
in
that
land
which
the
almighty
created
for
the
apaches
it
is
my
land
my
home
my
fathers
land
to
which
i
now
ask
to
be
allowed
to
return
i
want
to
spend
my
last
days
there
and
be
buried
among
those
mountains
if
this
could
be
i
might
die
in
peace
feeling
that
my
people
placed
in
their
native
homes
would
increase
in
numbers
rather
than
diminish
as
at
present
and
that
our
name
would
not
become
extinct
i
know
that
if
my
people
were
placed
in
that
mountainous
region
lying
around
the
headwaters
of
the
gila
river
they
would
live
in
peace
and
act
according
to
the
will
of
the
president
they
would
be
prosperous
and
happy
in
tilling
the
soil
and
learning
the
civilization
of
the
white
men
whom
they
now
respect
could
i
but
see
this
accomplished
i
think
i
could
forget
all
the
wrongs
that
i
have
ever
received
and
die
a
contented
and
happy
old
man
but
we
can
do
nothing
in
this
matter
ourselves
we
must
wait
until
those
in
authority
choose
to
act
if
this
can
not
be
done
during
my
lifetime
if
i
must
die
in
bondage
i
hope
that
the
remnant
of
the
apache
tribe
may
when
i
am
gone
be
granted
the
one
privilege
which
they
request
to
return
to
arizona
