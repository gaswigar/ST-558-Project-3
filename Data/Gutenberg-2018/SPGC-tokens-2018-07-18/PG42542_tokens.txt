the
head
thought
liberals
worse
than

ii
from
the
diary
of
iseult
of
brittany
mamma
sent
me
up
a
message
early
this
morning
to
say
that
i
was
to
put
on
my
best
white
gown
with
my
coral
necklace
as
guests
were
expected
she
did
say
who
nurse
was
in
a
fuss
and
pulled
my
hair
when
she
did
it
and
made
my
face
very
sore
by
scrubbing
it
with
i
ca
think
why
as
there
was
no
hurry
i
came
down
punctually
at
noon
mamma
and
papa
were
sitting
in
the
hall
waiting
fresh
rushes
were
strewn
on
the
floor
i
was
told
to
get
out
my
harp
and
to
sit
with
my
back
to
the
light
i
had
practised
for
weeks
and
i
can
only
play
one
song
properly
the
mallard
a
cornish
song
when
i
told
mamma
that
was
the
only
song
i
knew
she
said
i
was
on
no
account
to
mention
it
if
i
was
asked
to
play
but
i
was
only
to
play
songs
i
said
i
did
know
any
she
said
that
did
matter
but
that
i
could
sing
anything
i
knew
and
call
it
a
breton
song
i
said
nothing
but
i
thought
and
i
still
think
this
was
dishonest
besides
the
only
songs
that
i
know
are
quite
new
the
stable
people
whistle
them
and
they
come
from
rome
we
waited
a
long
time
papa
and
mamma
were
both
very
fidgety
and
mamma
kept
on
pulling
me
about
and
telling
me
that
my
hair
was
badly
done
and
that
she
could
see
daylight
between
the
pleats
of
my
frock
i
nearly
cried
and
papa
said
leave
the
dear
child
alone
she
very
good
after
we
been
waiting
about
twenty
minutes
the
trumpets
sounded
and
morgan
the
seneschal
walked
in
very
slowly
and
announced
sir
tristram
of
lyoness
rather
an
oldish
man
walked
in
with
a
reddish
beard
and
many
wrinkles
one
of
his
front
teeth
was
broken
and
the
other
was
black
he
was
dressed
in
a
coat
of
mail
which
was
too
tight
for
him
he
had
nice
eyes
and
seemed
rather
embarrassed
mamma
and
papa
made
a
great
fuss
about
him
and
brought
me
forward
and
said
this
is
our
daughter
iseult
and
mamma
whispered
to
me
show
your
hands
i
did
want
to
do
this
as
nurse
had
scrubbed
them
so
hard
that
they
were
red
sir
tristram
bowed
deeply
and
seemed
more
and
more
embarrassed
after
a
long
pause
he
said
it
a
very
fine
day
is
it
before
i
had
time
to
answer
mamma
broke
in
by
saying
iseult
has
been
up
since
six
with
the
falconers
this
was
true
and
i
was
surprised
that
mamma
should
be
so
forgetful
i
had
been
out
with
the
hawkers
for
weeks
then
dinner
was
served
it
lasted
for
hours
i
thought
and
the
conversation
flagged
terribly
kurneval
sir
tristram
squire
had
of
everything
and
drank
much
more
cider
than
was
good
for
him
after
dinner
mamma
told
me
to
fetch
my
harp
and
to
sing
a
breton
song
i
was
just
going
to
say
i
did
know
one
when
she
frowned
at
me
so
severely
that
i
did
dare
so
i
sang
the
provençal
orchard
song
about
waking
up
too
early
that
kerodac
the
groom
taught
me
sir
tristram
said
charming
charming
that
german
is
it
how
well
taught
she
is
i
do
like
good
singing
then
he
yawned
although
he
tried
not
to
and
papa
said
he
was
sure
sir
tristram
was
tired
and
that
he
would
take
him
to
see
the
stables
sir
tristram
then
became
quite
lively
and
said
he
would
be
delighted
when
they
gone
mamma
scolded
me
and
said
that
i
had
behaved
like
a
ninny
and
that
she
did
know
what
our
guests
would
think
of
me
it
seemed
to
me
we
only
had
one
guest
but
i
did
say
so
then
she
told
me
to
go
and
rest
so
as
to
be
ready
for
dinner
i
forgot
to
say
that
just
as
sir
tristram
was
going
out
of
the
room
he
said
to
papa
your
daughter
name
is
er
and
papa
said
yes
iseult
after
her
aunt
and
sir
tristram
said
oh
what
a
pretty
name
they
been
here
a
week
now
and
i
have
seen
much
of
them
because
sir
tristram
has
been
riding
with
papa
nearly
all
day
and
every
day
but
every
day
after
dinner
mamma
makes
me
sing
the
provençal
song
and
every
time
i
sing
it
sir
tristram
says
charming
charming
german
is
it
although
i
already
told
him
twice
now
that
it
is
i
like
sir
tristram
only
he
very
silent
and
after
dinner
he
becomes
sleepy
directly
just
like
papa
i
had
a
most
exciting
day
papa
and
mamma
sent
for
me
and
when
i
came
into
the
room
they
were
both
very
solemn
and
said
they
had
something
particular
to
say
to
me
then
mamma
cried
and
papa
tried
to
soothe
her
and
said
it
all
right
it
all
right
and
then
he
blurted
out
that
i
was
to
marry
sir
tristram
next
wednesday
i
cried
and
papa
cried
and
mamma
cried
and
then
they
said
i
was
a
lucky
girl
and
mamma
said
that
i
must
see
about
my
clothes
at
once
nurse
is
in
a
fearful
temper
she
says
we
shall
never
be
ready
by
wednesday
and
that
it
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
stand
to
worrit
folks
like
this
but
mamma
is
in
the
best
of
tempers
sir
tristram
has
gone
away
to
stay
with
some
friends
he
is
coming
back
on
tuesday
night
my
wedding
gown
is
to
be
made
of
silver
with
daisies
worked
on
it
the
weavers
are
working
day
and
night
most
of
the
stuff
is
it
belonged
to
mamma
i
do
think
they
might
have
given
me
a
new
gown
blanche
had
a
new
one
when
she
was
married
the
wedding
went
off
very
well
i
had
four
maidens
and
four
pages
after
mass
we
had
a
long
feast
papa
made
a
speech
and
broke
down
and
tristram
made
a
speech
and
got
into
a
muddle
about
my
name
and
everybody
was
silent
then
he
said
i
had
beautiful
hands
and
everybody
cheered
after
supper
we
were
looking
out
on
the
sea
and
just
as
tristram
was
becoming
talkative
i
noticed
that
he
wore
another
ring
besides
his
wedding
ring
a
green
one
made
of
jasper
i
said
what
a
pretty
ring
who
gave
it
you
he
said
oh
a
friend
and
changed
the
subject
then
he
said
he
was
very
tired
and
went
away
it
the
and
that
an
unlucky
number
nurse
said
that
no
child
of
hers
should
marry
in
may
so
i
suppose
that
what
brought
it
about
in
any
case
tristram
who
has
been
very
gloomy
ever
since
been
here
has
got
to
go
and
fight
in
a
tournament
he
says
he
wo
be
away
long
and
that
there
no
danger
not
any
more
than
crossing
the
sea
in
an
open
boat
which
i
think
dangerous
he
starts
at
dawn
nothing
particular
no
news
kurneval
arrived
this
evening
he
says
that
tristram
was
slightly
wounded
but
would
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
very
anxious
tristram
was
brought
back
on
a
litter
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
has
been
wounded
in
the
arm
the
doctors
here
say
he
was
bandaged
wrong
by
the
local
doctor
they
say
he
is
suffering
from
slight
local
pain
kurneval
says
the
horrid
henchman
hit
his
arm
as
hard
as
he
could
with
a
broad
sword
papa
and
mamma
arrive
with
the
doctor
tristram
insists
on
sleeping
out
of
doors
on
the
beach
the
doctor
says
this
is
a
patient
whim
and
must
be
humoured
i
sure
it
bad
for
him
as
the
nights
are
very
cold
i
been
too
busy
to
write
my
diary
for
weeks
tristram
is
still
just
the
same
the
doctors
say
there
is
no
fear
of
immediate
change
mamma
says
the
queen
of
cornwall
whose
name
is
iseult
the
same
as
mine
is
coming
for
a
few
days
with
her
husband
and
some
friends
i
do
think
it
very
inconsiderate
considering
how
full
the
house
is
already
and
what
with
tristram
being
so
ill
and
insisting
on
sleeping
on
the
beach
it
makes
it
very
difficult
for
every
one
papa
went
out
to
shoot
birds
with
his
new
but
he
came
back
in
a
bad
temper
as
he
only
shot
one
and
a
hen
tristram
is
no
better
he
keeps
on
talking
about
a
ship
with
a
black
sail
i
was
on
the
beach
with
tristram
and
he
asked
me
if
i
saw
a
ship
i
said
i
did
he
asked
me
if
the
sail
was
black
and
as
the
doctor
had
told
me
to
humour
him
i
said
it
was
upon
which
he
got
much
worse
and
i
had
to
call
the
doctors
they
said
he
was
suffering
from
hypertrophy
of
the
sensory
nerves
tristram
unconscious
the
queen
of
cornwall
just
arrived
too
busy
to
write
iii
from
the
diary
of
king
cophetua
castle
we
had
to
be
married
in
may
after
all
it
was
a
choice
between
that
and
being
married
on
a
friday
and
jane
would
not
hear
of
that
so
i
gave
in
poor
dear
mamma
relented
at
the
end
and
came
to
the
wedding
on
the
whole
she
behaved
with
great
restraint
she
could
not
help
saying
just
a
word
about
rash
promises
jane
looked
exceedingly
beautiful
i
felt
very
proud
of
her
i
regret
nothing
we
start
for
italy
we
are
to
visit
milan
rome
jane
is
looking
forward
to
the
change
we
decided
to
break
the
journey
here
but
we
shall
probably
start
again
as
jane
is
extremely
dissatisfied
with
the
inn
the
i
of
course
chose
the
best
but
she
says
she
found
a
spider
in
her
bedroom
she
complained
that
the
silver
plates
on
which
dinner
was
served
were
not
properly
cleaned
that
the
veal
was
tough
and
that
we
had
been
given
under
the
guise
of
all
these
things
seem
to
me
exceedingly
trivial
but
jane
is
particular
in
a
way
it
is
a
good
thing
but
considering
her
early
upbringing
and
her
former
circumstances
i
confess
i
am
astonished
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
get
to
italy
jane
becomes
more
and
more
fastidious
about
inns
she
walked
out
of
four
running
here
i
was
imprudent
enough
to
say
that
mamma
had
a
vassal
who
was
a
distant
connection
of
the
sieur
jehan
de
blois
and
jane
insisted
on
my
paying
him
a
visit
and
asking
him
to
lodge
us
telling
him
who
we
are
as
we
are
travelling
incognito
as
the
baron
and
baroness
of
wessex
this
put
me
in
a
very
awkward
position
as
i
do
know
him
i
did
it
however
and
jane
came
with
me
i
have
seldom
felt
so
awkward
but
really
he
could
not
have
made
things
easier
he
was
tact
itself
and
while
respecting
our
incognito
he
treated
us
with
the
utmost
consideration
he
was
most
kind
jane
made
me
a
little
uncomfortable
by
praising
a
fine
crystal
goblet
encrusted
with
emeralds
sieur
jehan
was
of
course
obliged
to
offer
it
her
and
to
my
vexation
she
accepted
it
jane
finds
our
incognito
more
and
more
irksome
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
real
quiet
holiday
where
we
could
get
away
from
all
fuss
and
worry
and
all
the
impediments
of
rank
and
riches
i
wanted
to
pretend
we
were
poor
for
a
while
to
send
on
the
litters
with
the
oxen
the
horses
and
the
baggage
and
to
ride
on
mules
as
soon
as
we
had
reached
the
south
but
jane
would
not
hear
of
this
she
said
she
had
had
enough
of
poverty
without
playing
at
it
now
this
is
of
course
quite
true
but
i
wish
she
would
say
such
things
before
people
it
makes
one
so
uncomfortable
here
she
has
insisted
on
our
staying
with
the
pope
which
may
put
me
in
a
very
awkward
position
with
regard
to
several
of
our
allies
in
italy
he
has
been
however
most
gracious
jane
is
very
impulsive
at
times
she
insisted
on
our
making
an
expedition
to
the
bridge
here
by
moonlight
and
dancing
on
it
she
kicked
off
her
shoes
and
danced
barefooted
i
asked
her
not
to
do
this
whereupon
she
said
if
the
courtiers
had
praised
my
ankles
you
would
never
have
married
me
and
what
the
use
of
having
pretty
ankles
if
nobody
can
see
them
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
get
to
italy
i
am
determined
to
preserve
a
strict
incognito
once
we
are
across
the
frontier
it
has
poured
with
rain
every
day
since
we
crossed
the
frontier
and
jane
wo
believe
that
it
is
ever
fine
in
italy
it
is
very
cold
for
the
time
of
year
and
the
people
here
say
that
there
has
not
been
such
a
summer
for
thirty
years
every
time
i
mention
the
blue
sky
of
italy
jane
loses
her
temper
she
spends
all
her
time
at
the
goldsmiths
shops
and
at
the
weavers
i
am
afraid
she
is
extravagant
and
her
taste
in
dress
is
not
quite
as
restrained
as
i
could
wish
of
course
it
does
matter
here
but
at
home
it
would
shock
people
for
instance
last
night
she
came
down
to
supper
dressed
as
a
turkish
sultana
in
pink
trousers
and
a
scimitar
and
without
even
a
veil
over
her
face
when
i
remonstrated
she
said
men
did
not
understand
these
things
it
is
still
raining
jane
refused
to
look
at
the
cathedral
and
spends
her
whole
time
at
the
merchants
booths
as
usual
i
broached
the
incognito
question
i
suggested
our
walking
on
foot
or
perhaps
riding
on
mules
to
florence
jane
to
my
great
surprise
said
she
would
be
delighted
to
do
this
and
asked
when
we
were
to
start
i
said
we
had
better
start
the
day
after
i
am
greatly
relieved
she
is
really
very
sensible
if
a
little
impulsive
at
times
but
considering
her
early
life
it
might
be
much
worse
i
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
she
is
greatly
admired
only
i
wish
she
would
not
wear
such
bright
colours
it
has
been
a
great
disappointment
just
as
we
were
making
preparations
to
start
entirely
incognito
jane
had
even
begged
that
we
should
walk
on
foot
the
whole
way
and
take
no
clothes
with
us
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
florentine
embassy
here
saying
that
the
duke
of
florence
had
heard
of
our
intended
visit
and
had
put
a
cavalcade
of
six
carriages
fifty
mules
seven
litters
and
a
hundred
at
our
disposal
how
he
could
have
heard
of
our
intention
i
do
know
jane
was
bitterly
disappointed
she
cried
and
said
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
walking
tour
more
than
to
anything
else
but
i
managed
to
soothe
her
and
she
eventually
consented
to
accept
the
escort
of
the
duke
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
refuse
as
it
was
we
were
very
comfortable
we
stopped
at
bologna
on
the
way
and
jane
insisted
on
going
to
the
market
and
buying
a
sausage
she
tried
to
make
me
taste
it
but
i
can
not
endure
the
taste
of
garlic
at
florence
we
were
magnificently
received
and
taken
at
once
to
the
palace
where
the
rooms
are
very
spacious
jane
complains
of
the
draughts
and
the
cold
it
is
still
pouring
with
rain
there
is
a
very
fine
collection
of
greek
statues
to
be
seen
here
but
jane
takes
no
interest
in
these
things
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
go
to
the
new
bridge
which
is
lined
with
goldsmiths
shops
on
both
sides
and
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
on
perfectly
useless
trinkets
she
says
she
must
have
some
things
to
bring
back
to
my
sisters
this
was
thoughtful
of
her
the
duke
is
going
to
give
a
great
banquet
in
our
honour
on
tuesday
next
the
feast
is
the
gardens
have
been
hung
with
lanterns
a
banquet
has
been
prepared
on
a
gigantic
scale
five
hundred
guests
have
been
bidden
jane
was
greatly
looking
forward
to
it
and
lo
and
behold
by
the
most
evil
mischance
a
terrible
vexation
has
befallen
us
a
courier
arrived
this
morning
bearing
letters
for
me
and
among
them
was
one
announcing
the
death
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
who
is
my
uncle
by
marriage
i
told
jane
that
of
course
we
could
not
possibly
be
present
at
the
banquet
jane
said
that
i
knew
best
but
that
the
duke
would
be
mortally
offended
by
our
absence
since
he
had
arranged
the
banquet
entirely
for
us
and
spent
a
sum
of
ducats
on
it
it
would
be
she
pointed
out
and
i
am
obliged
to
admit
she
is
right
most
impolitic
to
annoy
the
duke
after
an
hour
reflection
i
hit
on
what
seemed
to
me
an
excellent
solution
that
we
should
be
present
but
dressed
in
mourning
jane
said
this
was
impossible
as
she
had
no
black
clothes
then
she
suggested
that
i
should
keep
back
the
news
until
and
if
the
news
were
received
in
other
quarters
deny
its
authenticity
and
say
we
had
a
later
bulletin
this
on
the
whole
seemed
to
be
the
wisest
course
as
the
etiquette
here
is
very
strict
and
the
dowager
duchess
is
most
particular
i
pray
that
jane
may
be
careful
and
guarded
in
her
expressions
my
poor
dear
mother
was
right
after
all
i
should
have
listened
and
now
it
is
too
late
the
dinner
went
off
very
well
we
sat
at
a
small
table
on
a
raised
dais
jane
sat
between
the
duke
and
the
prime
minister
and
opposite
the
dowager
duchess
there
was
no
one
at
the
table
except
myself
under
sixty
years
of
age
and
only
the
greatest
magnates
were
present
jane
was
silent
and
demure
and
becomingly
dressed
i
congratulated
myself
on
everything
after
the
banquet
came
the
dance
and
jane
took
part
with
exquisite
grace
in
the
saraband
she
observed
all
the
rules
of
etiquette
the
dowager
duchess
seemed
charmed
with
her
then
later
came
supper
which
was
served
in
a
tent
and
which
was
perhaps
more
solemn
than
everything
when
the
time
came
to
lead
jane
to
supper
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
outside
in
the
garden
the
minor
nobles
were
dancing
in
masks
and
some
mimes
were
singing
we
waited
and
then
a
message
came
that
the
queen
had
had
a
touch
of
ague
and
had
retired
the
supper
went
off
gloomily
at
the
close
an
enormous
pie
was
brought
in
the
sight
of
which
caused
a
ripple
of
applause
viva
il
re
cophetua
was
written
on
it
in
letters
of
pink
sugar
it
was
truly
a
triumph
of
culinary
art
the
mime
announced
that
the
moment
had
come
for
it
to
be
cut
and
as
the
grand
duke
rose
to
do
this
the
thin
crust
burst
of
itself
and
out
stepped
jane
with
no
garments
beside
her
glorious
dark
hair
she
tripped
on
to
the
table
and
then
with
a
peal
of
laughter
leapt
from
it
and
ran
into
the
garden
since
when
she
has
not
been
heard
of
my
anguish
and
shame
are
too
great
for
words
but
the
duke
and
the
dowager
have
been
most
sympathetic
jane
has
fled
and
my
jewels
as
well
as
hers
are
missing
it
is
suspected
that
the
attaché
at
the
florentine
embassy
at
milan
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
conspiracy
for
jane
herself
had
a
good
heart
iv
from

diary
of

say
the

the
french
others
that
the
king
discomfyted
the
englysshe
but
the
englysshmen
repute
themselves

but
all
this
shall
be
told
in
my

which
i
shall
write
when
i
am
once
more
in
the
fayre
cytie
of

it
was
a

and
the

likewise
the

no

of

the
kynge
of

has
layd
siege

has
sayd
he
will
take
the
towne
by
famysshing
when
worde
of
this
was
brought
to
the
chronyclers
they
were
displeased
it
is
well
that
i
have
hyd
in
a
safe

some
wyne

other
thynges
necessarie
all
thynges
to

are
solde
at
a
great
pryce
a

costs
a

all
the
poore
and
mean
people
were
constrained
by
the
capture
of
calys
to
yssue
out
of
the
town
men
women
and
children
and
to
pass
through
the
englysshe
host
and
with
them
the
poore
chronyclers
and
the
kynge
of
englande
gave
them
and
the
chronyclers
mete
and
drinke
to
dyner
and
every
person
ii
sterlying
in
alms
and
the
chronyclers
have
added
to
the
lyst
of
their
costs
which
their
patrons
curtesly
pay
to
loss
of
honour
at
receiving
alms
from
an
englysshe
kynge
a
thousand
crounes
v
from
the
diary
of
george
washington
written
when
a
schoolboy
my
mother
has
at
last
consented
to
let
me
go
to
school
i
had
repeatedly
made
it
quite
plain
to
her
that
the
private
tuition
hitherto
accorded
to
me
was
inadequate
that
i
would
be
in
danger
of
being
outstripped
in
the
race
owing
to
insufficient
groundwork
my
mother
although
very
shrewd
in
some
matters
was
curiously
obstinate
on
this
point
she
positively
declined
to
let
me
attend
the
saying
that
she
thought
i
knew
quite
enough
for
a
boy
of
my
age
and
that
it
would
be
time
enough
for
me
to
go
to
school
when
i
was
older
i
quoted
to
her
tacitus
powerful
phrase
about
the
insidious
danger
of
indolence
how
there
is
a
charm
in
indolence
but
let
me
taste
the
full
pleasure
of
transcribing
the
noble
original
subit
quippe
etiam
ipsius
inertiæ
dulcedo
et
invisa
primo
desidia
postremo
amatur
but
she
only
said
that
she
did
not
understand
latin
this
was
scarcely
an
argument
as
i
translated
it
for
her
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
was
sometimes
an
element
of
pose
in
tacitus
terseness
i
went
to
school
for
the
first
time
i
confess
i
was
disappointed
we
are
reading
in
the
fourth
division
in
which
i
was
placed
at
my
mother
express
request
eutropius
and
ovid
both
very
insipid
writers
the
boys
are
lamentably
backward
and
show
a
deplorable
lack
of
interest
in
the
classics
the
french
master
has
an
accent
that
leaves
much
to
be
desired
and
he
seems
rather
shaky
about
his
past
participles
however
all
these
things
are
but
trifles
what
i
really
resent
is
the
gross
injustice
which
seems
to
be
the
leading
principle
at
this
school
if
school
it
can
be
called
for
instance
when
the
master
asks
a
question
those
boys
who
know
the
answer
are
told
to
hold
up
their
hands
during
the
history
lesson
henry
viii
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
religious
quarrels
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
question
which
i
confess
can
but
have
small
interest
for
any
educated
person
at
the
present
day
the
master
asked
what
british
poet
had
written
a
play
on
the
subject
of
henry
viii
i
of
course
held
up
my
hand
and
so
did
a
boy
called
jonas
pike
i
was
told
to
answer
first
and
i
said
that
the
play
was
in
the
main
by
fletcher
with
possible
later
interpolations
the
usher
it
is
scarcely
credible
said
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
form
and
when
jonas
pike
was
asked
he
replied
shakespeare
and
was
told
to
go
up
one
this
was
i
consider
a
monstrous
piece
of
injustice
during
one
of
the
intervals
which
are
only
too
frequent
between
the
lessons
the
boys
play
a
foolish
game
called
it
in
which
even
those
who
have
no
aptitude
and
still
less
inclination
for
this
tedious
form
of
are
compelled
to
take
part
the
game
consists
in
one
boy
being
named
it
though
why
the
neuter
is
used
in
this
case
instead
of
the
obviously
necessary
masculine
it
is
hard
to
see
he
has
to
endeavour
to
touch
one
of
the
other
boys
who
in
their
turn
do
their
best
to
evade
him
by
running
and
should
he
succeed
in
touching
one
of
them
the
boy
who
is
touched
becomes
it
it
is
all
very
tedious
and
silly
i
was
touched
almost
immediately
and
when
i
said
that
i
would
willingly
transfer
the
privilege
of
being
touched
to
one
of
the
other
boys
who
were
obviously
eager
to
obtain
it
one
of
the
bigger
boys
again
jonas
pike
gave
me
a
sharp
kick
on
the
shin
i
confess
i
was
ruffled
i
was
perhaps
to
blame
in
what
followed
i
am
perhaps
inclined
to
forget
at
times
that
providence
has
made
me
physically
strong
i
retaliated
with
more
insistence
than
i
intended
and
in
the
undignified
scuffle
which
ensued
jonas
pike
twisted
his
ankle
he
had
to
be
supported
home
when
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
the
accident
i
regret
to
say
he
told
a
deliberate
falsehood
he
said
he
had
slipped
on
the
ladder
in
the
gymnasium
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
inform
the
of
the
indirect
and
unwilling
part
i
had
played
in
the
matter
the
head
master
who
is
positively
unable
to
perceive
the
importance
of
said
i
suppose
you
mean
you
did
it
i
answered
no
sir
i
was
the
resisting
but
not
the
passive
agent
in
an
unwarrantable
assault
the
result
was
i
was
told
to
stay
in
during
the
afternoon
and
copy
out
the
first
eclogue
of
virgil
it
is
characteristic
of
the
head
master
to
choose
a
feeble
eclogue
of
virgil
instead
of
one
of
the
admirable
georgics
jonas
pike
is
to
be
flogged
as
soon
as
his
foot
is
well
for
his
untruthfulness
this
my
first
experience
of
school
life
is
not
very
hopeful
the
routine
of
the
life
here
seems
to
me
more
and
more
meaningless
the
work
is
to
me
child
play
and
indeed
chiefly
consists
in
checking
the
inaccuracies
of
the
ushers
they
show
no
gratitude
to
me
indeed
sometimes
the
reverse
of
gratitude
one
day
in
the
english
class
one
of
the
ushers
grossly
misquoted
pope
he
said
a
little
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing
i
held
up
my
hand
and
asked
if
the
line
was
not
rather
a
little
learning
is
a
dangerous
thing
adding
that
pope
would
scarcely
have
thought
a
little
to
be
dangerous
since
all
is
valuable
the
usher
tried
to
evade
the
point
by
a
joke
which
betrayed
gross
theological
ignorance
he
said
all
popes
are
not
infallible
one
of
the
boys
brought
into
school
a
foolish
toy
a
snake
that
contracts
under
pressure
and
expands
when
released
with
a
whistling
screech
jonas
pike
who
is
the
most
ignorant
as
well
as
the
most
of
all
the
boys
suggested
that
the
snake
should
be
put
into
the
french
master
locker
in
which
he
keeps
the
exercises
for
the
week
the
key
of
the
locker
is
left
in
charge
of
the
top
boy
of
the
class
who
i
say
it
in
all
modesty
is
myself
presently
another
boy
hudson
by
name
asked
me
for
the
key
i
gave
it
to
him
and
he
handed
it
to
pike
who
inserted
the
snake
in
the
locker
when
the
french
master
opened
the
locker
the
snake
flew
in
his
face
he
asked
me
if
i
had
had
any
hand
in
the
matter
i
answered
that
i
had
not
touched
the
snake
he
asked
me
if
i
had
opened
the
locker
i
of
course
said
no
questioned
further
as
to
how
the
snake
could
have
got
there
i
admitted
having
lent
the
key
to
hudson
ignorant
of
any
ulterior
purpose
in
spite
of
this
i
was
obliged
in
company
with
pike
and
hudson
to
copy
out
some
entirely
and
meaningless
exercises
in
syntax
a
pretty
little
episode
happened
at
home
the
gardener
boy
asked
me
if
he
might
try
his
new
axe
on
the
old
which
i
have
often
vainly
urged
mother
to
cut
down
i
said
by
all
means
it
appears
that
he
misunderstood
me
and
cut
down
the
tree
my
mother
was
about
to
send
him
away
but
i
went
straight
to
her
and
said
i
would
take
the
entire
responsibility
for
the
loss
of
the
tree
on
myself
as
i
had
always
openly
advocated
its
removal
and
that
the
gardener
boy
was
well
aware
of
my
views
on
the
subject
my
mother
was
so
much
touched
at
my
straightforwardness
that
she
gave
me
some
candy
a
refreshment
to
which
i
am
still
partial
would
that
the
ushers
at
school
could
share
her
fine
discrimination
her
sound
judgment
and
her
appreciation
of
character
vi
from
the
diary
of
marcus
aurelius
the
ides
of
it
is
curious
that
julius
cæsar
should
have
considered
this
date
to
be
unlucky
it
was
on
that
for
him
auspicious
date
that
he
was
for
ever
prevented
from
committing
the
egregious
folly
of
accepting
the
crown
of
rome
a
of
rome
is
an
unthinkable
thing
an
emperor
of
the
roman
empire
is
of
course
a
very
different
matter
faustina
in
accordance
with
some
ridiculous
tradition
committed
a
grossly
undignified
act
she
came
into
my
study
the
third
hour
my
busiest
time
and
asked
me
to
lend
her
the
memoirs
of
remus
in
the
wolf
lair
i
spent
a
fruitless
in
search
of
the
book
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
the
whole
matter
was
a
jest
in
the
very
worst
taste
since
both
my
secretaries
were
present
and
i
regret
to
say
they
smiled
went
to
the
games
in
company
with
faustina
and
commodus
commodus
as
usual
too
exuberant
in
the
manner
of
his
applause
i
am
all
in
favour
of
his
applauding
the
games
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
the
modern
lions
consume
the
christians
without
the
slightest
discrimination
all
this
modern
hurry
and
hustle
is
very
distressing
stayed
at
tivoli
with
v
and
a
from
saturday
to
monday
even
in
a
country
house
a
day
may
be
well
spent
much
interesting
talk
on
the
fiscal
question
v
deprecates
tariff
reform
in
all
its
shapes
a
while
remaining
as
he
ever
was
a
staunch
free
trader
considers
that
in
some
cases
and
given
certain
conditions
retaliation
is
admissible
possibly
in
the
matter
of
the
fringes
of
litters
and
the
axles
of
which
exclusively
concern
the
very
rich
an
exhilarating
day
walked
to
the
tiber
and
back
read
the
preface
of
the
new
persian
grammar
faustina
interrupted
me
three
times
over
purely
trivial
matters
of
domestic
detail
commodus
is
impossible
he
grows
more
and
more
extravagant
every
day
he
persists
in
spending
his
pocket
money
in
buying
absurd
pets
and
the
gods
know
that
faustina
has
enough
pets
in
the
house
already
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
have
drawn
the
line
at
badgers
i
put
my
foot
down
i
was
dignified
but
firm
i
endure
peacocks
because
i
think
it
is
good
for
my
better
nature
besides
which
they
are
ornamental
and
if
properly
dressed
not
unpleasant
to
the
palate
but
badgers
a
painful
episode
occurred
when
i
returned
from
my
morning
stroll
i
was
aware
that
an
altercation
was
taking
place
in
the
atrium
i
entered
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
two
persian
merchants
of
the
lowest
type
who
were
exhibiting
to
faustina
several
ropes
of
pearls
faustina
of
course
had
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
the
merchants
had
forced
themselves
on
her
presence
on
some
ridiculous
pretext
faustina
in
spite
of
her
faults
values
jewels
at
their
true
price
she
has
a
soul
above
such
things
she
abhors
trinkets
she
sees
their
futility
the
iliad
find
it
too
long
the
character
of
helen
shows
defective
psychology
homer
did
not
understand
women
games
again
very
tame
lions
lethargic
as
usual
how
dissatisfied
nero
would
have
been
nero
although
a
bad
poet
was
an
excellent
organiser
he
understood
the
of
the
he
was
essentially
an
altruist
faustina
insisted
on
making
a
foolish
bet
women
bets
are
the
last
word
of
silliness
they
bet
because
the
name
of
a
gladiator
reminds
them
of
a
pet
dog
or
for
some
such
reason
they
have
no
inkling
of
logic
no
power
of
deduction
i
found
no
difficulty
in
anticipating
the
victories
of
the
successful
candidates
but
i
refrained
from
making
a
wager
absurd
processions
in
the
streets
faustina
painted
her
face
black
and
walked
round
the
garden
in
a
movable
bower
of
greenery
i
could
see
no
kind
of
point
or
sense
in
the
episode
under
she
confessed
that
the
idea
had
been
suggested
to
her
by
her
nurse
all
this
is
very
trying
it
sets
commodus
the
worst
possible
example
but
i
suppose
i
must
endure
this
the
ways
of
fate
are
inscrutable
and
after
all
things
might
have
been
worse
faustina
might
have
been
a
loose
woman
a
profligate
read
out
the
first
canto
of
my
epic
on
the
origins
of
species
to
faustina
and
commodus
commodus
i
regret
to
say
yawned
and
finally
dozed
faustina
enjoyed
it
immensely
she
said
she
always
thought
that
i
was
a
real
poet
and
that
now
she
she
says
she
thinks
it
is
far
better
than
homer
or
virgil
that
there
is
so
much
more
in
it
faustina
is
a
very
good
judge
of
literature
there
is
no
one
whose
opinion
on
matters
of
art
and
literature
i
value
more
for
instance
she
thinks
sappho
lyrics
are
not
only
trivial
but
coarse
she
also
thinks
æschylus
much
overrated
which
of
course
he
is
how
far
we
have
got
beyond
all
that
some
day
i
mean
to
write
a
play
on
the
subject
of
love
it
has
never
yet
been
properly
treated
on
the
stage
sophocles
and
seneca
knew
nothing
of
women
and
euripides
women
are
far
too
complicated
meditated
on
religion
but
was
again
interrupted
by
faustina
just
as
i
was
making
a
really
illuminating
note
on
the
subject
of
isis
much
distressed
by
modern
free
thought
commodus
pays
much
too
much
attention
to
the
minor
goddesses
but
this
at
his
age
is
excusable
he
is
thank
goodness
entirely
untainted
by
the
detestable
jewish
or
christian
superstition
which
i
fear
is
spreading
v
and
a
dined
also
a
greek
philosopher
whose
name
escapes
me
the
greek
was
most
indiscreet
he
discussed
the
christian
question
before
everybody
he
must
have
been
aware
by
my
expression
that
the
topic
is
one
which
i
consider
unfit
for
public
discussion
he
not
only
discussed
but
he
actually
defended
this
hysterical
obstinate
unpatriotic
and
fundamentally
criminal
sect
i
do
not
of
course
entirely
credit
the
stories
current
with
regard
to
their
orgies
and
their
human
sacrifices
the
evidence
is
not
so
far
sufficiently
sound
but
whatever
their
practices
and
their
rites
may
be
the
christians
are
a
pernicious
and
dangerous
sect
they
will
prove
unless
they
are
extirpated
the
ruin
of
the
empire
they
have
no
notion
of
civic
duty
no
reverence
no
respect
for
custom
or
tradition
they
are
unfilial
and
they
are
the
enemies
of
the
human
race
they
are
a
cancer
in
the
state
faustina
agrees
with
me
i
am
glad
to
say
commodus
is
suspected
of
having
made
friends
with
a
christian
slave
the
rumour
is
no
doubt
a
calumny
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
a
son
of
mine
with
the
education
which
he
has
enjoyed
and
the
example
which
has
ever
been
before
his
eyes
of
his
unswerving
and
unremitting
devotion
to
duty
and
the
state
can
have
degraded
himself
by
dabbling
in
this
degrading
and
wicked
superstition
nevertheless
it
is
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
after
prolonged
reflection
i
have
decided
to
make
a
great
sacrifice
i
am
going
to
allow
him
to
take
part
professionally
in
the
games
under
another
name
of
course
i
think
it
may
distract
him
the
games
are
a
roman
institution
they
are
the
expression
of
the
empire
they
breathe
the
spirit
of
romulus
of
brutus
of
regulus
of
fabius
cunctator
of
cincinnatus
of
the
gracchi
faustina
said
only
yesterday
that
she
felt
she
was
the
mother
of
at
least
one
gracchus
that
was
well
said
i
was
much
touched
commodus
has
appeared
with
great
success
but
the
lions
still
show
apathy
vii
from
the
diary
of
mrs
james
lee
husband
at
last
the
heat
wave
is
over
it
the
first
day
we
have
been
able
to
breathe
for
months
just
as
i
was
coming
back
from
my
morning
walk
hilda
leant
out
of
the
window
and
suggested
i
could
climb
up
into
her
room
like
romeo
i
said
i
preferred
the
door
hilda
shut
the
window
with
a
bang
and
was
cross
all
through
luncheon
rissoles
again
i
said
to
hilda
you
know
i
hate
hashed
meat
she
said
i
know
i
ca
give
you
the
food
you
get
at
the
grand
hotel
that
because
i
went
to
deauville
last
week
we
lit
a
fire
for
the
first
time
last
night
hilda
said
she
felt
cold
i
thought
it
was
rather
stuffy
she
said
do
light
the
fire
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
lit
it
and
it
smoked
this
chimney
always
does
smoke
at
first
when
she
came
back
she
said
what
have
you
done
i
said
i
lit
the
fire
you
asked
me
to
she
said
but
not
all
that
wood
at
once
and
you
ought
to
have
pushed
the
wood
back
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
she
complained
of
the
heat
and
the
smoke
although
we
had
the
window
open
in
the
dining
room
and
the
smoke
had
all
disappeared
after
a
few
moments
it
very
windy
went
for
a
walk
on
the
cliffs
back
through
the
fields
saw
a
rabbit
and
a
magpie
wish
i
had
had
a
gun
i
said
to
hilda
that
the
sea
was
striped
to
leeward
like
a
snake
and
but
on
the
weather
side
it
was
spotted
with
wind
hilda
said
you
are
very
observant
about
the
weather
this
was
a
hit
at
me
and
the
fire
little
things
rankle
in
her
mind
afterwards
she
was
sorry
she
had
said
this
and
she
said
what
fun
we
shall
have
here
in
winter
i
do
think
it
a
winter
place
myself
but
i
want
to
stay
here
till
i
finished
my
poem
i
getting
on
with
it
i
read
out
to
hilda
a
lyric
i
had
just
finished
it
to
come
in
the
second
canto
when
lancelot
says
to
princess
asra
the
situation
is
roughly
that
the
princess
bullies
him
and
he
gets
sick
of
it
and
goes
and
then
of
course
she
sorry
when
it
too
late
he
sings
the
song
as
he
going
she
overhears
it
i
was
rather
pleased
with
it
hilda
said
oh
of
course
i
know
i
worry
you
with
my
attentions
what
this
had
got
to
do
with
the
poem
i
ca
think
it
was
all
because
last
night
when
i
was
working
hilda
came
into
my
room
and
said
are
you
warm
enough
and
i
said
yes
rather
as
i
was
in
the
middle
of
my
work
ten
minutes
later
she
looked
in
again
and
asked
me
if
i
wanted
some
beer
and
i
said
no
without
looking
up
then
very
soon
afterwards
she
came
in
a
third
time
and
asked
me
if
i
was
sure
i
was
cold
and
whether
i
would
have
the
fire
lit
rather
snappishly
because
it
is
a
bore
to
be
interrupted
just
when
one
on
the
verge
of
getting
an
idea
fixed
i
said
no
i
afraid
this
hurt
her
feelings
since
hilda
has
given
up
her
sketching
she
has
nothing
to
do
i
was
very
busy
this
afternoon
finishing
my
weekly
article
in
time
for
the
post
she
rushed
into
the
room
and
said
did
i
think
a
butterfly
settling
on
a
jock
was
the
ultimate
symbol
of
love
and
the
mind
of
man
i
said
i
thought
she
was
very
probably
right
heavens
knows
what
she
meant
women
minds
move
by
jerks
one
never
knows
what
they
say
next
they
so
irrelevant
it
blowing
a
gale
stuck
in
the
poem
hilda
says
cynical
i
do
know
what
she
means
she
says
she
did
know
i
was
so
bitter
i
said
it
only
a
kind
of
fairy
tale
she
said
yes
but
that
makes
it
worse
but
it
only
an
ordinary
love
story
i
said
she
said
of
course
i
know
nothing
can
go
on
being
the
same
it
can
no
doubt
be
better
but
not
the
same
as
it
was
before
but
princess
asra
is
only
an
incident
in
my
poem
i
said
hilda
said
nothing
but
after
a
time
she
asked
me
whether
i
thought
that
was
the
meaning
of
the
moan
of
the
wind
i
have
no
idea
what
she
meant
by
that
she
is
very
cryptic
sometimes
lovely
day
the
sun
came
out
and
i
suggested
that
i
should
take
a
holiday
and
that
we
should
go
and
have
a
picnic
on
the
rocks
i
was
afraid
hilda
might
have
something
against
the
plan
one
never
knows
but
she
did
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
delighted
she
made
a
hamper
and
i
carried
it
down
to
the
rocks
we
caught
shrimps
and
threw
stones
into
the
sea
just
like
children
i
think
hilda
enjoyed
herself
on
the
way
home
i
asked
her
why
she
did
go
on
with
her
drawing
i
really
think
it
a
great
pity
she
has
given
it
up
she
has
real
talent
she
said
i
will
if
you
wish
it
i
said
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
do
it
if
you
do
like
but
i
do
think
it
a
pity
to
waste
such
a
very
real
talent
she
said
i
quite
understand
and
sighed
i
wonder
what
she
was
thinking
of
hilda
is
absurdly
modest
she
draws
extremely
well
especially
figures
hilda
has
begun
drawing
again
i
am
delighted
she
began
copying
the
cast
of
a
hand
but
i
suggested
to
her
that
it
would
be
far
more
interesting
for
her
to
draw
a
real
hand
from
nature
so
she
got
a
little
girl
from
the
village
to
sit
for
her
i
am
delighted
it
gives
her
an
occupation
and
i
really
am
very
busy
just
now
after
all
we
came
here
so
as
not
to
be
disturbed
to
be
away
from
people
and
interruptions
and
i
find
that
in
the
last
two
months
i
have
got
through
less
work
than
i
did
in
london
in
june
i
must
make
up
for
lost
time
i
ca
get
on
with
the
poem
i
think
i
shall
leave
it
for
a
time
i
should
immensely
like
hilda
opinion
on
what
ought
to
happen
next
she
can
be
of
the
greatest
help
and
use
when
she
chooses
unfortunately
she
has
taken
one
of
those
unreasonable
and
entirely
unaccountable
dislikes
to
this
poem
and
no
argument
is
of
the
slightest
use
it
no
good
even
mentioning
it
i
shall
leave
it
for
a
time
and
go
on
with
my
other
work
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
hilda
should
look
upon
it
in
this
light
especially
as
she
does
even
know
what
the
subject
is
but
she
has
taken
an
episode
in
fact
one
little
song
as
symbolic
of
the
whole
but
then
logic
never
was
hilda
strong
point
hilda
is
getting
on
very
well
with
the
hand
she
seems
to
enjoy
it
which
is
the
great
thing
have
been
too
busy
all
these
last
days
thinking
even
to
write
my
diary
believe
i
have
at
last
really
got
an
idea
for
the
poem
shall
begin
have
not
dared
mention
it
to
hilda
fortunately
she
is
still
utterly
absorbed
in
her
drawing
great
disappointment
last
night
hilda
said
it
was
no
good
concealing
things
any
longer
and
that
one
must
look
facts
in
the
face
i
had
no
idea
what
she
meant
then
she
said
she
had
noticed
for
some
time
past
how
bored
i
was
here
and
how
i
was
longing
to
get
rid
of
her
nothing
i
could
say
would
persuade
her
of
the
contrary
i
tried
to
explain
that
i
had
been
searching
for
a
new
idea
and
that
this
had
no
doubt
made
me
appear
more
than
usual
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
worry
you
any
longer
i
am
going
to
set
you
free
and
to
my
intense
surprise
she
announced
that
she
had
booked
a
berth
on
the
steamer
for
the
day
after
i
knew
that
argument
would
be
of
any
use
so
i
gave
in
at
once
it
is
most
disappointing
just
as
i
had
got
an
idea
i
wanted
to
consult
her
about
on
board
the
steamer
saw
hilda
off
she
insisted
on
going
and
refused
to
argue
deeply
regret
she
is
leaving
hilda
is
the
only
woman
i
ever
met
who
remains
tidy
even
on
a
steamer
the
suits
her
it
has
done
her
a
world
of
good
and
it
a
great
pity
she
is
leaving
so
soon
she
says
it
for
good
but
that
of
course
is
ridiculous
viii
from
the
diary
of
sherlock
holmes
street
starting
a
diary
in
order
to
jot
down
a
few
useful
incidents
which
will
be
of
no
use
to
watson
watson
very
often
fails
to
see
that
an
unsuccessful
case
is
more
interesting
from
a
professional
point
of
view
than
a
successful
case
he
means
well
watson
has
gone
to
brighton
for
a
few
days
for
change
of
air
this
morning
quite
an
interesting
little
incident
happened
which
i
note
as
a
useful
example
of
how
sometimes
people
who
have
no
powers
of
deduction
nevertheless
stumble
on
the
truth
for
the
wrong
reason
this
never
happens
to
watson
lestrade
called
from
scotland
yard
with
reference
to
the
theft
of
a
diamond
and
ruby
ring
from
lady
dorothy
smith
wedding
presents
the
facts
of
the
case
were
briefly
these
on
thursday
evening
such
of
the
presents
as
were
jewels
had
been
brought
down
from
lady
dorothy
bedroom
to
the
to
be
shown
to
an
admiring
group
of
friends
the
ring
was
amongst
them
after
they
had
been
shown
the
jewels
were
taken
upstairs
once
more
and
locked
in
the
safe
the
next
morning
the
ring
was
missing
lestrade
after
investigating
the
matter
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ring
had
not
been
stolen
but
had
either
been
dropped
in
the
or
replaced
in
one
of
the
other
cases
but
since
he
had
searched
the
room
and
the
remaining
cases
his
theory
so
far
received
no
support
i
accompanied
him
to
eaton
square
to
the
residence
of
lady
middlesex
lady
dorothy
mother
while
we
were
engaged
in
searching
the
lestrade
uttered
a
cry
of
triumph
and
produced
the
ring
from
the
lining
of
the
i
told
him
he
might
enjoy
the
triumph
but
that
the
matter
was
not
quite
so
simple
as
he
seemed
to
think
a
glance
at
the
ring
had
shown
me
not
only
that
the
stones
were
false
but
that
the
false
ring
had
been
made
in
a
hurry
to
deduce
the
name
of
its
maker
was
of
course
child
play
lestrade
or
any
pupil
of
scotland
yard
would
have
taken
for
granted
it
was
the
same
jeweller
who
had
made
the
real
ring
i
asked
for
the
bridegroom
present
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
interviewing
the
jeweller
who
had
provided
it
as
i
thought
he
had
made
a
ring
with
imitation
stones
made
of
the
dust
of
real
stones
a
week
ago
for
a
young
lady
she
had
given
no
name
and
had
fetched
and
paid
for
it
herself
i
deduced
the
obvious
fact
that
lady
dorothy
had
lost
the
real
ring
her
uncle
gift
and
not
daring
to
say
so
had
had
an
imitation
ring
made
i
returned
to
the
house
where
i
found
lestrade
who
had
called
to
make
arrangements
for
watching
the
presents
during
their
exhibition
i
asked
for
lady
dorothy
who
at
once
said
to
me
the
ring
was
found
yesterday
by
mr
lestrade
i
know
i
answered
but
which
ring
she
could
not
repress
a
slight
twitch
of
the
eyelids
as
she
said
there
was
only
one
ring
i
told
her
of
my
discovery
and
of
my
investigations
this
is
a
very
odd
coincidence
mr
holmes
she
said
some
one
else
must
have
ordered
an
imitation
but
you
shall
examine
my
ring
for
yourself
she
fetched
the
ring
and
i
saw
it
was
no
imitation
she
had
of
course
in
the
meantime
found
the
real
ring
but
to
my
intense
annoyance
she
took
it
to
lestrade
and
said
to
him
is
this
the
ring
you
found
yesterday
mr
lestrade
lestrade
examined
it
and
said
of
course
it
is
absolutely
identical
in
every
respect
and
do
you
think
it
is
an
imitation
asked
this
most
provoking
young
lady
certainly
not
said
lestrade
and
turning
to
me
he
added
ah
holmes
that
is
where
theory
leads
one
at
the
yard
we
go
in
for
facts
i
could
say
nothing
but
as
i
said
to
lady
dorothy
i
congratulated
her
on
having
found
the
real
ring
the
incident
although
it
proved
the
correctness
of
my
reasoning
was
vexing
as
it
gave
that
ignorant
blunderer
an
opportunity
of
crowing
over
me
a
man
called
just
as
watson
and
i
were
having
breakfast
he
did
give
his
name
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
who
he
was
i
said
beyond
seeing
that
you
are
unmarried
that
you
have
travelled
up
this
morning
from
sussex
that
you
have
served
in
the
french
army
that
you
write
for
reviews
and
are
especially
interested
in
the
battles
of
the
middle
ages
that
you
give
lectures
that
you
are
a
roman
catholic
and
that
you
have
once
been
to
japan
i
do
know
who
you
are
the
man
replied
that
he
unmarried
but
that
he
lived
in
manchester
that
he
had
never
been
to
sussex
or
japan
that
he
had
never
written
a
line
in
his
life
that
he
had
never
served
in
any
army
save
the
english
territorial
force
that
so
far
from
being
a
roman
catholic
he
was
a
freemason
and
that
he
was
by
trade
an
electrical
engineer
i
suspected
him
of
lying
and
i
asked
him
why
his
boots
were
covered
with
the
clayey
and
chalk
mixture
peculiar
to
horsham
why
his
boots
were
french
army
service
boots
and
bought
probably
at
valmy
why
the
second
half
of
a
return
ticket
from
southwater
was
emerging
from
his
why
he
wore
the
medal
of
st
anthony
on
his
why
he
smoked
caporal
cigarettes
why
the
proofs
of
an
article
on
the
battle
of
eylau
were
protruding
from
his
together
with
a
copy
of
the
why
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
parcel
which
owing
to
the
untidy
way
in
which
it
had
been
made
an
untidiness
which
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
his
clothes
showed
that
he
could
not
be
married
revealed
the
fact
that
it
contained
photographic
magic
lantern
slides
and
why
he
was
tattooed
on
the
left
wrist
with
a
japanese
fish
the
reason
i
have
come
to
consult
you
will
explain
some
of
these
things
he
answered
i
was
staying
last
night
at
the
windsor
hotel
and
this
morning
when
i
woke
up
i
found
an
entirely
different
set
of
clothes
from
my
own
i
called
the
waiter
and
pointed
this
out
but
neither
the
waiter
nor
any
of
the
other
servants
after
making
full
enquiries
were
able
to
account
for
the
change
none
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
hotel
had
complained
of
anything
being
wrong
with
their
own
clothes
two
gentlemen
had
gone
out
early
from
the
hotel
at
one
of
them
had
left
for
good
the
other
was
expected
to
return
all
the
belongings
i
am
wearing
including
this
parcel
which
contains
slides
belong
to
someone
else
my
own
things
contained
nothing
valuable
and
consisted
of
clothes
and
boots
very
similar
to
these
my
coat
was
also
stuffed
with
papers
as
to
the
tattoo
it
was
done
at
a
turkish
bath
by
a
shampooer
who
learnt
the
trick
in
the
navy
the
case
did
not
present
any
features
of
the
slightest
interest
i
merely
advised
the
man
to
return
to
the
hotel
and
await
the
real
owner
of
the
clothes
who
was
evidently
the
man
who
had
gone
out
at
this
is
a
case
of
my
reasoning
being
with
one
partial
exception
perfectly
correct
everything
i
had
deduced
would
no
doubt
have
fitted
the
real
owner
of
the
clothes
watson
asked
rather
irrelevantly
why
i
had
not
noticed
that
the
clothes
were
not
the
man
own
clothes
a
stupid
question
as
the
clothes
were
which
fitted
him
as
well
as
such
clothes
ever
do
fit
and
he
was
probably
of
the
same
build
as
their
rightful
owner
found
a
carbuncle
of
unusual
size
in
the
suspected
the
makings
of
an
interesting
case
but
luckily
before
i
had
stated
any
hypothesis
to
watson
who
was
greatly
excited
mrs
turner
came
in
and
noticed
it
and
said
her
naughty
nephew
bill
had
been
at
his
tricks
again
and
that
the
red
stone
had
come
from
a
christmas
tree
of
course
i
had
not
examined
the
stone
with
my
lens
ix
from
the
diary
of
the
emperor
titus
titus
reginam
berenicem
cui
etiam
nuptias
pollicitus
ferebatur
statim
ab
urbe
demisit
invitus
invitam
tacitus
the
eruption
at
vesuvius
does
not
after
all
appear
to
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
as
i
at
first
had
thought
on
receiving
pliny
graphic
letter
one
never
can
quite
trust
literary
men
when
facts
are
in
question
it
is
clear
that
i
missed
a
very
fine
and
interesting
spectacle
in
fact
i
have
lost
a
day
good
phrase
that
must
try
and
bring
it
in
some
time
or
other
i
fear
there
is
no
doubt
of
berenice
growing
unpopularity
it
is
tiresome
as
i
was
hoping
that
the
marriage
might
take
place
soon
quietly
she
insists
on
wearing
a
diadem
which
is
unnecessary
and
her
earrings
made
of
emeralds
and
gold
cupids
are
too
large
she
asked
me
if
i
did
think
she
resembled
the
rose
of
sharon
i
said
i
supposed
she
meant
the
rose
of
paestum
she
said
ah
you
never
read
the
song
of
songs
i
said
i
had
read
all
sappho
she
said
it
not
by
sappho
it
by
solomon
i
had
no
idea
king
solomon
wrote
berenice
has
asked
some
of
her
relations
to
stay
with
her
they
arrived
this
morning
her
mother
her
sister
her
younger
brother
and
her
cousin
they
are
very
conversational
they
chatter
together
like
parrots
or
cockatoos
they
are
also
insatiably
inquisitive
talked
finance
with
paulinus
he
says
that
the
treasury
is
practically
empty
nobody
in
the
palace
appears
to
have
any
ready
money
when
the
usual
crowd
of
beggars
came
to
the
palace
this
evening
for
their
daily
allowance
i
had
to
send
them
away
it
was
the
first
time
paulinus
remarked
that
i
had
let
a
day
go
by
without
making
a
gift
yes
i
answered
i
have
lost
a
day
the
phrase
i
am
glad
to
say
was
heard
by
everybody
i
afterwards
borrowed
a
little
money
from
brother
who
made
no
difficulties
he
is
a
nice
generous
lad
if
a
little
talkative
but
then
we
all
of
us
have
our
faults
mother
loses
no
opportunity
of
asking
when
the
wedding
day
is
to
be
most
awkward
i
temporised
berenice
relations
have
spread
the
news
in
the
court
by
telling
it
to
one
of
the
matrons
in
strict
confidence
that
i
am
about
to
marry
berenice
almost
immediately
this
is
most
unfortunate
the
news
has
created
a
sensation
and
they
all
say
that
such
a
match
would
be
more
than
unpopular
amongst
the
people
berenice
has
not
mentioned
it
herself
lost
heavily
at
dice
yesterday
accepted
the
offer
of
berenice
brother
to
lend
me
a
lump
sum
instead
of
constantly
borrowing
small
coins
i
have
no
doubt
that
is
the
wiser
course
a
week
the
strain
on
my
purse
is
terrible
had
of
course
to
subscribe
largely
to
the
pompeii
and
herculaneum
fund
also
to
the
pestilence
relief
also
to
the
flavian
amphitheatre
fund
borrowed
another
lump
sum
from
berenice
brother
he
is
certainly
very
berenice
mother
again
referred
to
the
marriage
question
i
said
this
was
an
unlucky
month
for
marriages
not
if
you
are
born
in
december
she
answered
unfortunately
i
was
born
in
december
do
not
know
where
to
turn
for
money
do
not
always
want
to
be
borrowing
from
berenice
brother
somehow
or
other
it
makes
them
all
so
familiar
given
the
circumstances
and
the
extreme
unpopularity
of
their
presence
here
it
is
awkward
besides
it
is
a
shame
to
trade
on
the
of
a
youth
have
sold
all
the
decorations
of
the
imperial
residence
and
devoted
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
to
the
relief
fund
some
one
spread
the
rumour
among
the
dear
people
that
i
had
devoted
the
whole
of
the
money
to
the
relief
fund
i
can
not
think
how
these
rumours
get
about
a
week
this
has
been
a
most
expensive
fortnight
have
had
to
do
a
lot
of
entertaining
and
i
regret
to
say
i
have
been
once
more
obliged
to
borrow
a
lump
sum
from
berenice
brother
how
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
pay
him
back
the
gods
alone
know
had
the
news
of
my
marriage
unofficially
announced
followed
immediately
by
a
and
ambiguous
denial
made
to
see
what
effect
the
news
would
have
among
the
public
paulinus
says
the
impression
produced
was
deplorable
the
romans
can
not
he
says
forget
that
berenice
is
a
queen
of
course
they
ca
if
she
will
wear
a
crown
people
say
he
says
that
even
nero
and
caligula
avoided
offending
public
opinion
on
this
point
they
refer
also
to
julius
cæsar
action
on
the
lupercal
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
a
course
will
ensure
me
a
lasting
unpopularity
but
what
is
to
be
done
berenice
relations
talk
of
the
marriage
as
a
matter
of
course
i
have
practically
promised
marriage
berenice
herself
says
nothing
but
her
silence
is
eloquent
her
brother
becomes
more
and
more
familiar
and
presses
me
to
accept
further
loans
i
do
my
best
to
refuse
and
i
have
made
a
vow
that
the
lump
sum
which
he
lent
me
shall
be
positively
the
last
one
paulinus
tells
me
that
the
senate
have
decided
to
present
me
with
a
monster
petition
against
my
marriage
since
it
is
obviously
impossible
owing
to
the
strong
feeling
raised
and
the
present
excited
state
of
popular
opinion
i
have
resolved
to
anticipate
events
and
i
have
given
leave
to
paulinus
to
contradict
the
rumours
of
my
impending
marriage
he
is
to
add
unofficially
that
berenice
is
shortly
leaving
rome
for
change
of
air
and
that
she
will
probably
spend
the
summer
months
in
her
charming
villa
on
the
dead
sea
in
the
meantime
i
have
got
to
break
the
news
to
berenice
before
morning
antiochus
the
king
of
commagene
arrived
here
this
morning
more
expense
night
the
crisis
is
partially
over
it
has
been
extremely
painful
berenice
at
first
was
incredulous
then
she
was
upset
and
left
me
threatening
to
kill
herself
i
sent
paulinus
to
try
and
calm
her
she
then
said
she
would
leave
rome
without
setting
eyes
on
me
again
and
state
her
reasons
in
an
open
letter
which
she
would
issue
for
private
circulation
only
this
of
course
would
have
been
most
undesirable
her
mother
and
sister
backed
her
up
and
threw
up
at
me
the
example
of
antony
taunting
me
with
cowardice
of
being
afraid
of
the
senate
and
of
outraging
the
dignity
of
a
family
royal
in
rank
and
of
immemorial
lineage
berenice
is
directly
descended
from
king
solomon
on
her
mother
side
finally
berenice
brother
came
to
me
and
said
that
as
he
would
shortly
be
leaving
rome
he
would
be
obliged
if
i
could
pay
him
back
the
trifling
loans
he
had
favoured
me
with
he
brought
a
list
of
them
he
charges
interest
it
is
a
tradition
he
says
in
his
family
to
charge
per
cent
interest
on
loans
he
said
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
apply
to
the
senate
if
the
reimbursement
in
any
way
incommoded
me
this
was
a
great
shock
to
me
immediate
repayment
was
and
is
impossible
the
marriage
is
equally
impossible
i
told
berenice
frankly
that
i
could
not
remain
in
rome
as
emperor
and
the
husband
of
a
foreign
she
said
but
why
should
i
be
empress
she
missed
the
point
i
said
i
was
willing
to
follow
her
to
her
villa
and
renounce
all
claim
to
the
empire
having
offered
her
this
alternative
i
summoned
antiochus
who
is
an
old
friend
of
hers
to
be
the
arbiter
as
soon
as
the
facts
were
put
before
him
i
left
them
and
antiochus
had
a
lengthy
interview
with
berenice
in
private
i
was
convinced
this
was
the
best
course
at
the
end
of
it
berenice
generously
refused
to
accept
my
sacrifice
and
while
renouncing
all
idea
of
or
retaliation
announced
her
intention
of
leaving
rome
but
those
loans
and
their
terrible
interest
that
matter
is
still
unsettled
all
has
been
settled
antiochus
has
lent
me
the
whole
sum
due
to
berenice
brother
and
a
handsome
margin
for
my
personal
use
i
restored
the
interest
and
capital
of
the
loan
to
berenice
brother
said
farewell
to
the
family
before
the
whole
court
and
handed
berenice
brother
a
fine
gold
chain
as
a
slight
token
of
my
esteem
this
he
said
is
too
much
no
man
i
answered
should
leave
his
prince
presence
dissatisfied
hereupon
the
whole
court
murmured
applause
and
by
a
slight
gesture
i
indicated
that
the
audience
was
at
an
end
berenice
alas
left
rome
at
noon
escorted
by
antiochus
who
is
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
in
palestine
i
can
say
in
all
conscientiousness
that
i
have
not
lost
a
day
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
lost
everything
else
that
there
is
to
lose
in
this
life
x
from
the
diary
of
harriet
shelley
street
edinburgh
mr
hogg
arrived
this
morning
he
seemed
at
first
to
be
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
city
of
the
unfortunate
queen
mary
bysshe
and
i
conducted
him
to
the
palace
of
holyrood
immediately
where
we
inspected
the
instructive
and
elegant
series
of
portraits
of
the
scottish
kings
i
was
much
affected
by
the
sight
of
the
unfortunate
queen
bedroom
mr
hogg
has
not
been
well
grounded
in
history
and
he
was
on
more
than
one
occasion
inaccurate
he
had
never
heard
of
fergus
the
just
bysshe
was
much
moved
and
enchanted
by
the
objects
of
interest
he
ran
through
the
rooms
at
a
great
pace
now
and
then
pointing
back
at
an
object
of
interest
and
exclaiming
that
is
good
i
regretted
the
absence
of
eliza
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
she
was
not
with
us
on
this
occasion
she
would
not
have
permitted
me
to
contemplate
the
tragic
stain
of
rizzio
wound
for
fear
of
the
effect
the
sight
might
have
on
my
nerves
mr
hogg
was
strangely
insensible
to
the
sorrowful
associations
of
the
spot
after
we
had
inspected
the
rooms
and
the
relics
bysshe
with
intent
i
with
renewed
awe
and
mr
hogg
with
a
somewhat
inopportune
levity
bysshe
was
obliged
to
go
home
and
write
letters
and
so
i
suggested
that
mr
hogg
should
conduct
me
to
arthur
seat
in
order
to
enjoy
the
sublime
prospect
which
that
eminence
commands
so
sublime
so
grand
so
inspiring
was
the
view
that
even
mr
hogg
was
impressed
as
for
myself
words
fail
to
express
the
manifold
and
conflicting
emotions
which
were
stirred
in
my
breast
the
weather
was
fine
clear
and
tranquil
but
alas
no
sooner
had
we
started
on
our
descent
than
the
wind
began
to
blow
with
great
violence
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
me
in
such
circumstances
to
risk
the
impropriety
which
might
be
occasioned
had
the
wind
as
was
only
too
probable
so
disturbed
my
dress
as
to
reveal
to
my
companion
the
indelicate
spectacle
of
my
decently
concealed
ankles
so
i
seated
myself
on
a
rock
resolving
to
wait
until
the
violence
of
the
wind
should
subside
mr
hogg
who
laid
unnecessary
stress
on
the
fact
that
he
had
not
dined
on
either
of
the
preceding
days
and
being
deficient
in
a
proper
sense
of
delicacy
and
seemliness
vowed
he
would
desert
me
and
proceed
home
by
himself
to
my
dismay
he
began
to
carry
his
threat
into
execution
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
i
succeeded
in
accomplishing
the
descent
without
affording
him
any
unseemly
exhibition
the
manner
in
which
the
sabbath
is
observed
in
this
city
is
repellent
to
my
principles
bysshe
and
mr
hogg
have
gone
to
the
kirk
i
pleaded
the
wearisome
performance
would
be
certain
in
my
case
to
bring
on
a
headache
and
so
i
remained
at
home
they
returned
much
exhausted
by
the
wrestlings
of
an
eminent
divine
with
satan
i
am
engaged
in
translating
madame
cottin
immortal
claire
into
english
prose
this
occupies
my
morning
bysshe
is
translating
a
treatise
of
buffon
with
which
we
were
both
of
us
charmed
in
the
evenings
i
read
out
telemachus
i
regret
to
say
that
bysshe
fell
asleep
while
i
was
but
half
way
through
an
instructive
discourse
of
idomeneius
relating
to
the
wise
laws
of
crete
mr
hogg
is
an
attentive
listener
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
read
to
him
travelled
by
from
darlington
read
anna
st
ives
by
holcroft
in
the
chaise
throughout
the
journey
bysshe
was
restless
and
suggested
my
skipping
certain
portions
of
the
narrative
i
of
course
declined
knowing
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
authoress
that
her
work
should
be
read
without
omissions
bysshe
is
obliged
to
go
to
london
in
the
evenings
i
read
out
dr
historical
works
to
mr
hogg
we
are
on
the
eve
of
a
great
event
my
dear
sister
eliza
has
consented
to
visit
us
and
is
about
to
arrive
what
a
privilege
for
mr
hogg
what
a
source
of
pleasure
for
bysshe
i
ardently
regret
that
he
should
not
be
present
to
welcome
her
eliza
has
arrived
i
am
deeply
touched
by
her
kindness
in
coming
and
overcome
when
i
think
what
a
joyful
surprise
her
presence
will
be
for
bysshe
and
how
it
will
illuminate
our
household
bysshe
arrived
from
london
eliza
spent
the
day
brushing
her
hair
in
the
evening
i
suggested
reading
aloud
from
holcroft
but
eliza
such
is
her
feared
that
it
might
upset
my
nerves
she
felt
certain
too
that
her
esteemed
friend
miss
warne
whom
she
regards
as
a
pattern
and
model
in
all
things
would
not
approve
of
holcroft
eliza
is
certain
that
miss
warne
would
find
nothing
to
admire
in
york
minster
changed
our
lodgings
eliza
thinks
that
the
pure
mountain
air
of
the
lakes
would
be
salutary
to
my
nerves
bysshe
and
mr
hogg
miss
our
evening
readings
i
sometimes
however
continue
to
read
to
them
in
an
undertone
when
eliza
is
brushing
her
hair
but
the
pleasure
is
marred
by
the
trepidation
i
am
in
lest
i
should
disturb
her
eliza
objects
to
the
name
bysshe
she
is
certain
miss
warne
could
not
endure
such
a
name
so
in
future
my
husband
shall
be
called
percy
it
is
certainly
prettier
and
more
romantic
we
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
southeys
mr
southey
is
a
great
reader
and
devotes
two
hours
daily
to
the
study
of
the
portuguese
and
spanish
languages
mrs
southey
is
an
adept
at
and
binds
her
husband
books
with
elegance
and
neatness
bysshe
i
mean
percy
has
alas
three
times
narrowly
risked
offending
the
poet
the
first
time
by
inadvertently
taking
a
book
down
from
one
of
his
the
second
time
by
falling
asleep
when
mr
southey
after
having
locked
him
into
his
study
was
reading
aloud
to
him
his
epic
the
curse
of
kehama
and
the
third
time
by
sharply
criticising
his
action
in
eating
and
by
subsequently
devouring
a
whole
plate
of
them
himself
bysshe
i
mean
percy
has
implored
me
to
beg
mrs
southey
to
instruct
me
in
the
art
of
making
i
wish
eliza
could
begin
to
realise
the
existence
of
bysshe
i
mean
percy
she
seems
altogether
unaware
of
his
presence
in
the
house
but
then
eliza
is
so
much
occupied
in
considering
what
will
be
best
for
me
that
she
has
no
time
to
bestow
any
attention
to
anything
else
percy
is
contemplating
the
composition
of
a
poem
which
is
to
be
called
queen
mab
eliza
said
that
miss
warne
had
a
horror
of
queen
mab
bysshe
explained
to
her
that
his
poem
was
to
be
didactic
and
philosophical
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
fairies
that
said
eliza
makes
it
worse
bysshe
ran
out
of
the
room
with
shrill
exclamation
of
impatience
hush
hush
said
eliza
think
of
poor
harriet
nerves
bysshe
confessed
to
me
that
he
could
see
neither
beauty
nor
charm
in
eliza
this
is
curious
since
her
black
hair
has
always
been
an
object
of
universal
admiration
i
am
afraid
that
eliza
does
not
understand
him
i
need
hardly
say
what
a
disappointment
this
is
to
me
bysshe
and
i
were
thinking
of
writing
a
novel
in
collaboration
but
eliza
said
that
miss
warne
considered
that
it
was
not
seemly
for
a
woman
to
dabble
in
fiction
bysshe
i
mean
percy
in
writing
i
find
it
difficult
to
accustom
myself
to
the
new
name
but
i
am
fortunately
successful
in
the
presence
of
eliza
in
always
saying
percy
percy
and
i
are
thinking
of
studying
hebrew
i
have
not
yet
told
eliza
of
this
project
she
is
opposed
to
my
reading
latin
authors
in
their
original
tongue
we
were
walking
this
afternoon
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
percy
eliza
and
myself
percy
was
talking
of
plato
republic
when
eliza
interrupted
him
by
recalling
to
his
mind
something
which
she
had
indeed
often
mentioned
before
namely
miss
warne
positive
dislike
of
all
the
greek
authors
and
especially
plato
scarcely
had
she
uttered
these
words
when
we
looked
round
and
found
that
bysshe
had
vanished
in
silence
like
a
ghost
in
the
trees
we
called
and
searched
for
him
in
vain
but
when
we
returned
to
the
house
we
found
him
awaiting
us
buried
in
a
book
the
incident
greatly
displeased
eliza
and
she
insisted
upon
my
taking
to
my
bed
as
soon
as
we
got
home
although
i
confess
i
felt
no
suspicion
of
any
ailment
nor
would
she
hear
of
my
reading
either
aloud
or
to
myself
she
sat
by
my
brushing
her
hair
she
grieved
me
by
saying
that
she
could
not
conceive
what
miss
warne
would
think
of
bysshe
i
mean
percy
xi
from
the
journal
intime
of
the
emperor
tiberius
disquieting
news
from
parthia
artabanus
is
giving
trouble
again
shall
probably
have
to
send
an
expedition
the
military
party
in
rome
say
that
there
will
probably
be
unrest
in
thrace
in
the
spring
i
remember
they
said
the
same
thing
last
year
slept
wretchedly
last
night
claricles
medicine
is
worse
than
useless
wrote
three
despatches
and
one
private
letter
fed
hannibal
the
tortoise
went
for
a
stroll
in
the
afternoon
picked
the
first
and
put
it
in
water
the
gardener
says
we
shall
have
some
rain
shortly
please
the
gods
this
may
be
true
as
the
country
needs
it
badly
dined
alone
played
spilikins
after
dinner
with
fufius
but
found
it
a
strain
woke
at
four
and
remained
awake
until
seven
then
went
asleep
again
and
overslept
myself
scolded
balbus
for
not
calling
me
he
said
he
did
not
dare
call
me
more
emphatically
told
him
it
must
not
occur
again
nothing
particular
letter
from
my
mother
begging
me
to
come
and
see
her
says
she
is
suffering
from
lung
trouble
women
are
so
unreasonable
she
must
realise
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
get
away
just
at
present
hannibal
would
not
touch
his
lettuce
this
is
the
third
day
running
it
has
happened
claricles
has
given
him
some
medicine
strolled
along
to
cliffs
in
the
morning
much
vexed
by
a
fisherman
who
pushed
a
lobster
under
my
very
nose
i
have
a
horror
of
shellfish
varus
and
aufidius
dined
found
their
conversation
a
strain
so
retired
early
read
the
seventh
book
of
the
æneid
but
found
it
insipid
virgil
will
certainly
not
live
he
was
a
sycophant
anniversary
of
poor
julia
death
began
to
write
short
poem
on
the
subject
but
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
courier
from
rome
much
vexed
as
it
altogether
interrupted
my
train
of
thought
and
spoilt
what
would
have
been
a
fine
elegy
news
from
rome
unsatisfactory
it
rained
in
the
afternoon
so
i
did
not
go
out
sorted
my
specimens
of
dried
herbs
which
are
in
a
sad
state
of
confusion
dined
alone
dictated
a
despatch
to
sejanus
read
some
of
the
alcestis
euripides
before
going
to
bed
alcestis
reminds
me
of
julia
in
many
ways
she
had
the
same
fervid
altruism
and
the
same
knack
of
saying
really
disagreeable
things
but
they
both
meant
well
a
lovely
spring
day
went
for
a
stroll
and
jotted
down
a
few
ideas
for
a
poem
on
spring
the
birds
were
singing
listened
for
some
time
to
the
babbling
of
the
brook
think
of
alluding
to
this
in
the
poem
desilientis
aquae
would
make
a
good
ending
to
a
pentameter
mentioned
it
to
fufius
when
i
came
in
casually
he
said
he
did
not
think
it
was
very
original
fufius
is
he
does
not
poetry
finished
the
memorial
lines
on
julia
ending
ave
atque
vale
shall
not
show
them
to
fufius
he
would
be
certain
to
say
something
disparaging
positively
haunted
by
the
sight
of
the
wild
tulips
in
the
hills
fluttering
in
the
breeze
sights
like
this
live
in
the
memory
disturbed
early
in
the
morning
by
a
noise
of
hammering
it
is
strange
that
i
go
this
happens
made
inquiries
and
ascertained
that
the
stable
roof
is
being
repaired
if
it
is
not
the
stable
roof
it
is
sure
to
be
something
else
last
week
it
was
a
strayed
cow
which
woke
me
at
five
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
sleep
in
the
early
morning
whatever
precautions
i
take
in
a
month
time
the
nightingales
will
begin
and
then
sleep
will
be
out
of
the
question
thinking
of
writing
a
poem
called
to
sleep
claricles
says
i
am
overworked
and
need
a
change
have
decided
to
go
for
a
short
walking
tour
quite
by
myself
thought
of
taking
fufius
but
knowing
how
he
is
decided
not
to
packed
my
knapsack
took
an
extra
pair
of
sandals
a
worsted
scarf
an
ivory
comb
two
gold
toothpicks
and
a
volume
of
sappho
songs
find
this
light
feminine
verse
suitable
for
outdoor
life
shall
start
early
had
my
hair
cut
the
slave
was
clumsy
when
cutting
round
the
ears
they
still
smart
find
this
fault
to
be
universal
among
haircutters
shall
take
tablets
with
me
in
order
to
jot
down
any
ideas
for
future
poems
although
claricles
advises
me
to
give
up
writing
for
two
or
three
weeks
returned
earlier
than
i
expected
walking
tour
successful
on
the
whole
visited
sorrentum
an
idyllic
spot
not
sure
i
prefer
it
to
capreæ
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
man
is
always
discontented
with
what
he
has
and
hankers
after
what
he
has
not
got
walked
leisurely
the
first
day
stopping
every
now
and
then
for
light
refreshment
found
the
country
people
very
civil
and
anxious
to
please
nobody
knew
who
i
was
and
i
was
intensely
gratified
by
many
spontaneous
and
frank
experiences
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
emperor
this
is
refreshing
in
this
sceptical
age
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
although
i
may
not
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
great
military
genius
like
julius
cæsar
i
shall
at
least
leave
a
blameless
name
as
far
as
my
domestic
life
is
concerned
and
an
untarnished
reputation
for
benevolence
kindness
and
unswerving
devotion
to
duty
without
being
conceited
i
think
that
some
of
my
verse
will
live
i
think
i
shall
be
among
the
roman
poets
when
i
die
but
this
is
not
saying
much
when
one
considers
the
absurd
praise
given
to
poetasters
such
as
virgil
and
ponticus
strolling
along
the
seashore
near
sorrentum
a
very
pretty
little
episode
occurred
a
woman
one
of
the
fishermen
wives
was
sitting
by
her
cottage
door
spinning
her
child
a
little
girl
about
six
years
old
was
playing
with
a
doll
hard
by
i
said
good
day
to
the
fisherman
wife
and
she
offered
me
a
glass
of
wine
i
declined
as
claricles
has
forbidden
me
red
wine
but
i
said
i
would
gladly
accept
a
bowl
of
milk
she
immediately
went
to
fetch
it
and
the
child
went
with
her
when
they
returned
the
child
offered
me
the
bowl
lisping
in
a
charming
manner
i
drank
the
milk
and
the
mother
then
said
to
the
child
tell
the
kind
gentleman
whom
you
love
best
in
the
world
papa
and
mamma
lisped
the
child
and
after
that
asked
the
mother
after
that
the
divine
emperor
tiberius
who
is
the
father
and
the
mother
of
us
all
she
said
i
gave
the
mother
a
gold
piece
fufius
says
it
is
a
mistake
to
give
money
to
the
poor
and
that
it
pauperises
them
he
says
one
does
more
harm
than
good
by
indiscriminate
charity
but
i
think
it
can
not
be
a
bad
thing
to
follow
the
impulses
of
the
heart
i
should
like
this
to
be
said
of
me
although
he
had
many
faults
such
as
discontent
and
want
of
boldness
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
it
is
little
incidents
like
the
one
i
noted
above
which
make
up
for
the
many
disappointments
and
trials
of
a
monarch
life
the
second
day
of
my
tour
was
marred
by
a
but
i
found
a
thrush
nest
and
three
eggs
in
it
there
are
few
things
which
move
me
so
inexpressibly
as
the
sight
of
a
nest
with
the
eggs
lying
in
it
it
is
curious
that
the
egg
should
be
so
ugly
owing
to
the
bad
weather
and
the
rheumatism
in
my
joints
which
it
brought
on
i
was
obliged
to
cut
short
my
tour
extract
probably
belongs
to
a
later
asinius
gallus
has
again
sent
in
a
petition
about
the
prison
fare
it
appears
he
has
a
conscientious
objection
to
eating
veal
the
officials
say
they
can
do
nothing
if
they
make
an
exception
in
his
favour
they
will
be
obliged
to
do
so
in
many
less
deserving
cases
i
confess
these
little
things
worry
me
our
prison
system
seems
to
me
lacking
in
elasticity
but
it
is
dreadfully
difficult
to
bring
into
effect
any
sweeping
reform
because
if
the
prison
disciplinary
system
is
modified
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
more
cultivated
prisoners
the
prisons
would
be
crowded
with
ruffians
who
would
get
themselves
arrested
on
purpose
at
least
this
is
the
official
view
and
it
is
shared
by
sejanus
who
has
gone
into
the
matter
thoroughly
i
confess
it
leaves
me
unconvinced
i
am
glad
to
say
we
are
ahead
of
the
persians
in
the
matter
in
persia
they
think
nothing
of
shutting
up
a
prisoner
of
whatever
rank
in
a
cell
and
keeping
him
isolated
from
the
world
sometimes
for
as
long
as
three
months
at
a
time
this
seems
to
me
barbarous
the
heat
is
overpowering
agrippina
threatens
to
come
home
and
to
bring
her
daughter
i
wrote
saying
i
thought
it
is
very
unwise
to
bring
children
here
at
this
time
of
year
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
fever
she
answered
that
her
daughter
was
looking
forward
to
the
if
they
come
it
will
mean
that
my
summer
will
be
ruined
i
went
to
the
home
farm
this
afternoon
the
farmer
wife
is
very
ill
there
is
little
or
no
hope
of
her
recovery
spent
two
hours
there
reading
out
passages
of
the
odyssey
she
does
not
understand
greek
but
it
seemed
to
soothe
her
her
husband
told
her
that
he
felt
confident
that
she
could
not
get
worse
after
this
the
faith
of
these
simple
folk
is
most
touching
how
unlike
fufius
and
all
his
friends
there
is
no
news
except
that
as
always
occurs
at
this
time
of
year
the
phœnix
is
reported
to
have
been
seen
in
egypt
one
of
those
distressing
little
incidents
happened
which
entirely
spoil
one
comfort
and
peace
of
mind
for
the
moment
just
like
a
piece
of
dust
getting
into
one
eye
my
old
friend
lucius
anuseius
came
all
the
way
from
rhodes
to
see
me
by
some
mistake
he
was
shown
into
the
chamber
where
prisoners
are
examined
and
before
the
error
was
rectified
he
was
rather
rudely
interrogated
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
balbus
mistook
him
for
titus
anuseius
the
informer
balbus
is
growing
more
and
more
stupid
he
forgets
everything
i
ought
to
send
him
away
on
the
other
hand
he
knows
my
habits
and
i
should
feel
lost
without
him
as
it
is
claricles
says
that
lucius
is
likely
to
feel
it
for
several
days
he
is
so
sensitive
and
the
slightest
thing
upsets
his
nerves
all
his
family
are
touchy
and
i
am
afraid
he
will
look
upon
the
matter
as
a
deliberate
slight
if
it
had
happened
to
anyone
else
it
would
not
have
mattered
they
would
have
understood
at
once
this
has
quite
put
me
out
but
as
fufius
says
how
little
i
shall
think
of
this
in
a
year
time
lucius
anuseius
left
the
island
in
a
huff
it
is
most
regrettable
agrippina
arrives
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
how
pleasant
life
would
be
were
it
not
for
one
relations
xii
from
the
diary
of
œdipus
rex
the
feast
of
the
my
birthday
and
all
went
oft
very
successfully
papa
gave
me
a
chariot
and
mamma
a
pocket
set
in
gold
with
an
egyptian
inscription
on
it
two
flamingoes
and
a
which
means
in
egyptian
be
merry
and
wise
nausicaa
my
nurse
gave
me
a
with
a
present
from
corinth
beautifully
worked
into
it
in
silk
polyphemus
our
faithful
old
messenger
who
has
only
one
eye
gave
me
a
pair
of
sandal
strings
very
useful
as
i
always
losing
mine
in
the
morning
after
i
had
received
all
the
family
congratulations
and
tokens
at
the
first
meal
there
was
a
public
presentation
of
gifts
in
the
palace
the
town
of
corinth
sent
a
deputation
headed
by
the
priest
of
the
temple
of
castor
and
pollux
which
presented
me
on
behalf
of
the
city
with
a
silver
vase
symbolic
of
the
freedom
of
the
city
beautifully
embossed
and
engraved
with
a
suitable
inscription
the
priest
made
a
long
speech
and
papa
who
never
cared
for
oratory
kept
on
muttering
by
demeter
be
brief
but
the
priest
was
brief
he
spoke
for
nearly
an
hour
then
i
had
to
respond
i
said
i
would
earnestly
endeavour
to
follow
in
my
father
footsteps
and
to
deserve
the
and
esteem
of
my
future
subjects
which
was
being
manifested
in
so
touching
and
patriotic
a
fashion
my
speech
had
all
been
written
out
for
me
beforehand
by
zoroaster
my
persian
tutor
but
i
flatter
myself
i
added
a
few
unexpected
and
telling
touches
for
instance
i
began
by
saying
unaccustomed
as
i
am
to
speaking
in
public
they
cheered
this
to
the
echo
i
also
managed
to
bring
in
rather
an
amusing
anecdote
about
how
a
foreign
merchant
called
abraham
tried
to
get
the
better
of
a
corinthian
merchant
in
a
bargain
and
how
the
corinthian
got
the
best
of
him
by
guile
this
provoked
loud
laughter
my
peroration
ending
with
the
words
what
do
they
know
of
corinth
who
only
corinth
know
a
quotation
from
tyrtæus
was
loudly
cheered
but
my
cousin
thersites
almost
spoilt
the
effect
by
adding
audibly
quite
enough
in
the
afternoon
there
were
games
and
an
ox
was
roasted
whole
for
the
papa
says
now
i
am
of
age
i
must
go
and
pay
my
respects
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
it
is
a
family
tradition
what
is
the
date
arrived
at
last
after
a
tedious
journey
the
inn
is
very
uncomfortable
this
is
too
bad
as
in
the
guide
book
odysseus
it
is
marked
with
a
constellation
of
the
pleiades
which
means
very
good
the
wine
tastes
of
tar
and
the
salt
is
a
chemical
compound
called
i
made
a
scene
and
asked
for
ordinary
salt
and
they
had
got
any
shall
not
stay
at
this
inn
again
and
i
shall
warn
others
not
to
it
is
called
ξενωλοχειον
βαγονλη
disappointed
in
the
temple
very
architecture
and
still
more
in
the
oracle
i
suppose
it
thought
i
did
pay
enough
but
because
one
happens
to
be
a
prince
i
do
see
why
one
should
be
robbed
besides
which
i
am
travelling
incognito
as
kyrios
ralli
but
the
priests
bowed
and
they
all
called
me
your
shiningness
the
oracle
was
quite
absurd
and
evidently
in
a
very
bad
temper
it
said
i
would
kill
my
father
and
marry
my
mother
it
only
shows
how
absurd
the
whole
thing
is
i
hate
superstition
and
oracles
ought
to
be
stopped
by
law
gypsies
on
the
roadside
are
put
in
gaol
why
should
oracles
be
supported
by
the
state
i
shall
write
to
the
about
it
in
the
afternoon
went
to
the
theatre
saw
the
tragedy
of
adam
and
eve
a
historical
drama
translated
from
the
hebrew
very
long
the
part
of
the
archangel
danced
by
thepsis
was
very
bad
and
the
man
who
danced
eve
was
too
old
but
the
snake
was
good
scenery
fine
especially
the
tree
which
had
real
leaves
arrived
this
morning
very
disappointing
the
famous
daulian
nightingale
is
not
singing
this
spring
just
my
luck
rather
an
amazing
incident
happened
yesterday
on
the
way
my
chariot
was
run
into
by
a
stranger
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
and
of
course
entirely
in
the
wrong
also
his
charioteer
was
not
sober
we
shouted
and
we
gave
them
ample
room
and
time
but
he
ran
straight
into
us
and
his
chariot
was
upset
the
owner
and
charioteer
were
both
taken
to
the
æsculapian
home
which
is
under
the
management
of
the
red
serpent
the
doctor
said
it
was
serious
we
did
all
we
could
but
had
to
go
on
as
i
was
due
at
daulis
a
year
staying
with
queen
jocasta
a
charming
widow
all
very
comfortable
everybody
is
concerned
about
the
sphinx
who
is
really
causing
great
annoyance
asking
impertinent
riddles
and
playing
dangerous
practical
jokes
on
people
who
ca
answer
they
want
me
to
go
very
tiresome
as
i
never
could
answer
a
riddle
but
it
difficult
to
refuse
saw
the
sphinx
guessed
the
riddle
first
shot
it
asked
what
was
that
which
runs
on
two
legs
has
feathers
and
a
beak
and
barks
like
a
dog
i
said
pheasant
and
i
added
you
put
that
in
about
the
barking
to
make
it
more
difficult
the
sphinx
was
very
angry
and
went
off
in
a
huff
for
good
as
a
reward
for
getting
rid
of
the
sphinx
i
am
allowed
to
marry
the
queen
we
are
engaged
everybody
thinks
it
an
excellent
thing
she
is
a
little
older
than
i
am
but
i
do
think
that
matters
years
rather
a
severe
epidemic
of
plague
they
say
it
is
not
bubonic
however
in
fact
it
is
what
they
call
plagueen
still
there
are
a
great
many
deaths
a
week
the
plague
increasing
have
sent
for
tiresias
to
find
out
what
it
comes
from
tiresias
arrived
very
cross
and
guarded
do
believe
he
knows
anything
about
it
does
want
to
commit
himself
he
loves
making
mysteries
insisted
on
tiresias
speaking
out
regret
having
done
so
now
he
flew
into
a
passion
and
threatened
the
whole
court
with
exposure
and
revelations
that
the
last
thing
we
want
now
had
it
all
out
with
tiresias
he
told
the
most
absurd
cock
and
bull
story
utterly
preposterous
but
very
disagreeable
even
to
have
such
things
hinted
said
nothing
to
jocasta
as
yet
luckily
there
are
no
proofs
tiresias
has
raked
up
an
old
shepherd
who
is
ready
to
swear
i
am
not
the
son
of
the
king
of
corinth
but
the
son
of
laius
king
of
thebes
and
of
jocasta
my
wife
and
that
laius
was
the
man
i
accidentally
killed
years
ago
on
the
road
to
daulis
tiresias
says
this
is
the
sole
cause
of
the
plague
which
is
getting
worse
they
now
say
it
asiatic
i
interviewed
and
the
shepherd
in
the
presence
of
tiresias
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
about
the
facts
but
i
can
not
see
that
any
good
can
be
done
now
after
all
these
years
by
making
a
public
scandal
it
is
after
all
a
family
matter
tiresias
says
the
plague
will
not
stop
unless
the
whole
truth
is
published
very
awkward
do
know
how
to
break
it
to
jocasta
jocasta
overheard
me
discussing
the
matter
with
tiresias
and
jumped
rashly
to
conclusions
she
had
hysterics
and
losing
all
seriously
injured
both
my
eyes
with
a
pin
i
may
very
likely
be
blind
for
life
she
was
very
sorry
afterwards
and
is
now
laid
up
i
and
the
children
leave
for
colonnus
and
it
is
settled
that
i
am
to
abdicate
in
favour
of
creon
on
the
plea
of
and
overwork
the
children
have
been
told
nothing
but
antigone
who
is
far
too
precocious
alluded
to
jocasta
as
the
matter
will
be
hushed
up
as
far
as
possible
colonnus
two
months
the
air
here
is
delicious
must
say
the
change
is
doing
me
good
xiii
from
the
diary
of
william
the
conqueror
disquieting
news
from
london
my
friend
benefactor
and
relation
my
brother
sovereign
edward
of
england
has
again
had
one
of
his
attacks
it
comes
i
am
sure
from
not
eating
meat
were
anything
to
happen
to
him
i
should
be
obliged
to
go
over
to
london
at
once
and
settle
as
to
the
carrying
on
of
the
government
with
harold
nothing
could
be
more
inconvenient
at
the
present
moment
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
harold
but
i
fear
the
influence
of
the
english
nobility
i
like
the
english
but
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
in
foreign
politics
they
are
naturally
perfidious
and
they
do
know
it
they
think
they
are
more
virtuous
than
other
people
or
rather
that
they
are
exempted
from
the
faults
and
the
vices
which
are
common
to
us
all
the
european
situation
seems
unsatisfactory
among
other
things
father
anselm
writes
that
a
certain
party
among
the
englishwomen
want
to
be
admitted
to
the
witenagemot
the
majority
of
the
women
are
against
it
the
agitators
sent
a
deputation
to
westminster
but
the
king
said
it
would
not
be
according
to
the
precedents
to
receive
them
they
were
so
annoyed
at
this
that
they
made
a
dastardly
attack
on
the
beautiful
old
druid
temple
of
stonehenge
almost
completely
destroying
it
anselm
says
only
a
few
blocks
of
stone
are
left
and
that
the
place
is
unrecognisable
the
ringleaders
were
taken
and
claimed
the
ordeal
by
fire
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
said
that
it
was
not
a
matter
to
be
dealt
with
by
ordeal
quite
right
he
put
the
case
into
the
hands
of
a
select
body
of
matrons
chosen
from
all
classes
these
decided
that
the
offenders
should
be
publicly
whipped
by
women
and
sent
home
this
was
done
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
heard
mass
and
went
out
hunting
excellent
sport
shot
a
fox
and
six
thrushes
had
for
dinner
find
it
difficult
to
get
on
without
aid
received
a
letter
from
the
pope
he
says
that
should
anything
happen
to
king
edward
he
is
of
course
far
from
suggesting
such
a
thing
but
one
must
take
everything
into
consideration
i
must
be
very
firm
about
claiming
the
succession
says
that
although
of
course
it
would
be
indelicate
for
him
to
raise
the
question
he
knows
it
is
the
king
wish
that
i
should
succeed
him
he
seems
to
think
harold
may
give
trouble
but
harold
is
bound
to
me
by
oath
also
i
saved
his
life
took
william
out
hunting
his
red
hair
frightens
the
ducks
have
told
him
over
and
over
again
to
get
a
green
cap
the
boys
are
always
quarrelling
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
robert
broke
his
new
yesterday
in
a
fit
of
passion
my
only
consolation
is
that
henry
is
really
making
some
progress
with
his
tutor
he
last
learnt
the
alphabet
as
far
as
the
letter
f
a
fisherman
arrived
last
night
from
southampton
with
the
news
that
king
edward
is
dead
the
news
he
said
was
confirmed
by
the
appearance
of
a
strange
star
with
a
tail
to
it
in
the
sky
i
have
questioned
the
courier
and
gathered
he
had
only
got
the
news
at
the
rumour
is
probably
baseless
the
regular
courier
did
not
arrive
this
evening
the
bag
was
brought
by
an
englishman
the
official
bulletin
states
that
the
king
is
slightly
indisposed
owing
to
a
feverish
cold
which
he
caught
while
inspecting
the
body
of
archers
in
the
new
forest
a
private
letter
from
the
archbishop
tells
me
in
strict
confidence
that
the
king
illness
is
more
dangerous
than
people
think
the
children
again
quarrelled
matilda
as
usual
took
henry
part
and
said
i
was
to
blame
these
domestic
worries
are
very
trying
at
such
a
critical
moment
as
a
matter
of
fact
henry
teases
his
elder
brothers
and
boasts
to
them
of
his
superior
scholarship
they
retaliate
naturally
enough
by
cuffing
the
boy
who
complains
at
once
to
his
mother
since
henry
has
mastered
the
rudiments
of
the
alphabet
his
conceit
has
been
quite
beyond
bounds
of
course
i
admit
it
is
clever
of
him
he
is
a
clever
boy
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
but
he
take
advantage
of
it
again
the
regular
courier
has
not
arrived
the
bag
again
brought
by
an
englishman
according
to
a
bulletin
the
king
is
going
on
well
received
a
very
friendly
note
from
harold
putting
pevensey
castle
at
my
disposal
should
i
visit
england
in
the
autumn
and
suggesting
sport
in
the
new
forest
messenger
arrived
direct
from
london
newhaven
he
says
the
king
died
last
week
and
that
harold
has
proclaimed
himself
king
matilda
said
this
would
happen
from
the
first
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
news
is
authentic
the
messenger
who
is
an
old
servant
of
mine
is
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
he
saw
the
king
body
lying
in
state
this
explains
why
the
regular
messengers
have
not
arrived
harold
had
them
stopped
at
the
coast
this
in
itself
is
an
unfriendly
act
matilda
says
i
must
invade
england
at
once
think
she
is
right
but
wish
war
could
be
avoided
have
written
to
the
pope
asking
for
his
moral
support
invasion
a
risky
thing
discussed
the
matter
with
general
bertram
who
is
an
excellent
strategist
he
says
he
can
devise
fifty
ways
of
landing
troops
in
england
but
not
one
way
of
getting
them
out
again
that
is
just
it
supposing
we
are
cut
off
the
english
army
is
said
to
be
very
good
indeed
invasion
of
england
settled
must
say
have
great
misgivings
on
the
subject
if
we
fail
the
king
of
france
is
certain
to
attack
us
here
matilda
however
wo
hear
of
any
other
course
being
taken
have
privately
sent
a
message
to
harold
proposing
that
we
should
settle
the
matter
in
a
friendly
fashion
i
offer
him
nearly
all
wessex
wales
and
scotland
and
the
north
i
taking
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
including
london
and
winchester
his
situation
is
by
no
means
entirely
enviable
his
brothers
are
certain
to
fight
him
in
the
north
and
the
king
of
norway
may
also
give
trouble
received
letter
from
the
pope
entirely
approving
of
invasion
sends
me
back
banner
blessed
received
a
letter
from
harold
also
very
insulting
answers
vaguely
and
commits
himself
to
nothing
ignores
the
past
seems
to
forget
i
saved
him
from
shipwreck
and
that
he
solemnly
swore
to
support
my
claims
seems
also
to
forget
that
i
am
the
lawful
heir
to
the
english
throne
the
crowning
insult
is
that
he
addressed
the
letter
to
duke
william
the
bastard
have
ordered
mobilisation
to
take
place
at
once
the
war
is
popular
matilda
and
i
were
loudly
cheered
when
we
drove
through
the
market
place
this
afternoon
war
will
be
a
good
occupation
for
the
boys
robert
wants
to
stop
here
as
regent
do
not
think
this
wise
very
disagreeable
crossing
took
medicine
recommended
by
matilda
nettle
leaves
and
milk
and
cinnamon
but
did
no
good
harold

something
must
be
done
going
next
week
to

to
hunt
very
fine
wild
pony
hunting
there
xiv
from
the
diary
of
mary
mrs
john
milton
powell
street
not
quite
such
fun
as
i
thought
it
would
be
john
is
very
particular
he
can
not
eat
mutton
or
any
kind
of
hashed
meat
he
compares
the
cooking
here
unfavourably
with
that
of
italy
he
says
the
boys
in
the
school
are
very
naughty
and
that
during
the
latin
lesson
this
morning
one
boy
called
jones
minor
put
a
pin
on
his
chair
just
before
he
sat
down
on
it
i
could
help
laughing
and
this
made
john
cross
he
is
thinking
of
writing
a
poem
about
king
arthur
and
the
burnt
cakes
john
has
begun
his
poem
he
makes
it
up
during
meals
which
makes
him
forget
to
eat
and
makes
the
meal
very
gloomy
he
writes
it
down
afterwards
he
read
me
a
long
piece
of
it
last
night
but
as
it
is
in
latin
i
did
not
understand
very
much
of
it
john
and
i
quarrelled
it
was
about
jones
minor
john
announced
the
news
of
a
reported
rebel
success
during
the
boys
greek
lesson
and
told
the
boys
to
give
three
cheers
for
the
rebel
army
which
of
course
they
all
did
as
they
would
never
dare
to
disobey
except
one
brave
i
call
him
called
jones
minor
the
son
of
a
tinker
bless
him
who
called
out
as
loud
as
he
could
long
live
king
charles
and
death
to
all
traitors
john
told
him
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
and
he
did
and
john
caned
him
i
think
this
was
very
wrong
on
john
part
because
of
course
the
rebels
traitors
i
took
the
part
of
the
boy
and
this
made
john
angry
then
i
said
of
course
if
all
loyalists
are
so
wicked
why
did
you
marry
me
my
father
is
loyal
and
i
am
heart
and
soul
for
the
king
and
the
church
john
said
that
women
politics
did
count
but
that
the
young
must
be
taught
discipline
that
he
was
tolerant
of
all
opinion
however
much
he
disagreed
with
it
but
that
the
boy
had
merely
wished
to
be
insolent
by
flying
in
the
face
of
public
opinion
and
the
will
of
the
school
which
was
the
will
of
the
and
therefore
the
will
of
god
merely
to
gain
a
cheap
notoriety
i
said
that
probably
all
the
boys
felt
the
same
but
did
dare
say
so
as
they
knew
that
he
john
was
on
the
other
side
john
said
there
are
only
seven
malignants
in
the
school
he
said
the
boys
were
very
angry
with
jones
minor
and
kicked
him
i
said
they
were
a
set
of
cowards
john
said
did
i
mean
he
was
a
coward
and
quoted
greek
i
said
i
did
understand
greek
and
did
want
to
that
comes
from
your
false
education
said
john
your
parents
deserve
the
severest
blame
i
said
that
if
he
said
anything
against
my
parents
i
would
leave
the
house
and
that
my
father
knew
latin
as
well
as
he
did
john
said
i
was
exaggerating
i
said
that
i
had
often
heard
papa
say
that
john
verses
were
poor
john
said
when
his
epick
on
king
alfred
and
the
lady
of
the
lake
would
be
published
we
should
see
who
knew
how
to
write
latin
i
said
who
john
said
i
was
flighty
and
ignorant
i
said
i
might
be
ignorant
but
at
least
i
was
a
rebel
john
said
i
was
too
young
to
understand
these
things
and
that
considering
my
bringing
up
i
was
right
to
hold
the
opinions
i
did
when
i
was
older
i
would
see
that
they
were
false
then
i
cried
we
made
up
our
quarrel
john
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
very
dear
and
said
he
regretted
that
he
had
used
such
vehement
language
i
forgave
him
at
once
we
had
some
friends
to
dinner
before
we
sat
down
john
said
we
will
not
mention
politicks
as
we
might
not
all
agree
and
that
would
mar
the
harmony
of
the
symposium
but
towards
the
end
of
dinner
i
drank
the
king
health
quite
unwittingly
and
from
force
of
habit
forgetting
this
made
john
angry
and
led
to
a
discussion
some
of
our
guests
taking
the
king
part
and
others
saying
that
he
was
quite
wrong
the
men
became
very
excited
and
a
young
student
called
wyatt
whom
john
had
invited
because
he
is
very
musical
and
cultivated
threw
a
glass
of
wine
in
the
face
of
mr
lely
the
who
is
a
violent
rebel
and
this
broke
up
the
party
john
said
that
all
malignants
were
the
same
and
that
they
none
of
them
had
any
manners
that
they
were
a
set
of
roystering
dissolute
debauchees
when
i
thought
of
my
dear
father
and
my
dear
brothers
this
made
me
very
angry
but
i
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
at
the
time
as
john
was
already
annoyed
and
excited
john
says
he
ca
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
write
his
epick
poem
in
latin
or
in
hebrew
i
asked
him
whether
he
could
write
it
in
english
he
told
me
not
to
be
irrelevant
the
city
is
very
dreary
john
disapproves
of
places
of
public
amusement
he
is
at
the
school
all
day
and
in
the
evening
he
is
busy
thinking
over
his
poem
being
married
is
not
such
fun
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
john
is
quite
different
from
what
he
was
when
he
courted
me
in
the
country
sometimes
i
think
he
notices
that
i
am
there
at
all
i
wish
i
were
in
the
country
john
was
in
good
temper
because
a
scholar
came
here
yesterday
who
said
he
wrote
italian
very
well
he
asked
me
for
my
advice
about
his
epick
poem
which
i
thought
was
the
best
subject
for
an
epick
king
arthur
and
the
cakes
or
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
this
made
me
feel
inclined
to
laugh
very
much
fancy
writing
a
poem
on
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
everybody
knows
it
but
i
did
laugh
out
loud
so
as
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
and
i
said
adam
and
eve
because
i
felt
somehow
that
he
wanted
me
to
say
that
he
was
so
pleased
and
said
that
i
had
an
extraordinarily
good
judgment
when
i
chose
we
had
some
cowslip
wine
for
dinner
which
i
brought
from
the
country
with
me
john
drank
my
health
in
latin
which
was
a
great
favour
as
he
never
says
grace
in
latin
because
he
says
it
popish
john
is
thinking
of
not
writing
an
epick
poem
after
all
at
least
not
yet
but
a
history
of
the
world
instead
he
says
it
has
never
been
properly
written
yet
john
has
settled
to
translating
the
bible
into
latin
verse
i
am
afraid
i
annoyed
him
because
when
he
told
me
this
i
said
i
had
always
heard
papa
say
that
the
bible
was
written
in
latin
he
said
i
ought
to
talk
about
things
which
i
did
understand
i
am
altogether
put
about
there
are
two
irish
boys
in
the
school
one
is
called
kelley
and
comes
from
the
north
and
the
other
is
called
and
comes
from
the
south
they
had
a
quarrel
about
politicks
and
called
kelley
a
rebel
a
heretick
a
traitor
to
his
country
a
renegade
a
coward
and
a
bastard
and
kelley
said
that
was
an
idolater
and
a
foreigner
and
ended
up
by
saying
he
hoped
he
would
go
and
meet
the
pope
do
you
mean
to
insult
the
pope
before
me
said
yes
said
kelley
to
hell
with
your
pope
i
could
hear
and
see
all
this
from
my
window
as
the
boys
were
talking
in
the
yard
kelley
then
shouted
to
hell
with
the
pope
as
loud
as
he
could
three
times
and
turned
quite
white
with
rage
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
quite
slowly
your
father
turned
traitor
for
money
just
like
judas
then
the
boys
flew
at
each
other
and
began
to
fight
and
at
that
moment
john
who
was
thinking
over
his
epick
poem
in
the
rushed
out
and
stopped
them
then
he
sent
for
both
the
boys
and
asked
them
what
it
was
all
about
but
they
both
refused
to
say
a
word
then
john
sent
for
the
whole
school
and
said
that
unless
some
boy
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
he
would
stop
all
for
a
month
so
pyke
a
boy
who
had
been
there
told
the
whole
story
john
caned
both
and
kelley
for
using
strong
language
in
the
evening
mr
pye
came
to
dinner
from
oxford
he
teaches
the
oxford
boys
physic
or
greek
philosophy
i
forget
which
but
no
sooner
had
we
sat
down
to
dinner
than
he
began
to
abuse
the
rebels
and
john
who
was
already
cross
said
that
he
did
not
suppose
mr
pye
meant
to
defend
the
king
mr
pye
said
he
had
always
supposed
that
that
was
a
duty
every
englishman
took
for
granted
and
john
became
very
angry
i
never
heard
anybody
use
such
dreadful
language
he
said
the
king
was
a
lying
monkey
full
of
popish
anticks
a
wolf
disguised
as
a
jackass
a
son
of
belial
a
scarlet
ahithophel
and
mr
pye
was
so
shocked
that
he
got
up
and
went
away
i
said
that
people
who
insulted
the
king
were
rebels
however
clever
they
might
be
and
that
it
was
dreadful
to
use
such
language
and
when
i
thought
of
his
beating
those
two
little
boys
this
morning
for
using
not
half
such
strong
language
it
made
me
quite
mad
john
said
that
i
was
illogical
i
said
i
would
hear
any
more
bad
language
and
i
ran
upstairs
and
locked
myself
in
my
room
i
have
come
home
i
could
bear
it
john
was
too
unjust
whenever
i
think
of
those
two
irish
boys
and
of
language
at
dinner
my
blood
boils
went
out
riding
this
morning
with
the
boys
papa
says
the
war
news
is
better
and
that
the
rebels
will
soon
be
brought
to
heel
xv
from
the
diary
of
mark
antony
undated
the
reception
went
off
very
well
the
queen
came
to
meet
me
by
water
in
her
state
barge
she
is
different
from
what
i
remember
her
long
ago
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
rome
then
she
was
rather
a
colourless
young
girl
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
very
well
read
and
rather
affected
but
now
when
you
look
at
her
face
and
you
look
away
you
see
green
from
the
flash
as
though
you
had
been
staring
at
the
sun
she
dazzles
and
blinds
you
i
received
her
in
the
market
place
her
curtsey
was
a
miracle
of
grace
she
was
very
civil
and
dignified
after
i
had
received
her
in
the
market
place
i
went
to
her
palace
such
is
the
etiquette
i
invited
her
to
supper
but
she
insisted
on
my
being
her
guest
i
accepted
supper
in
her
palace
as
the
court
is
in
mourning
for
archilaus
the
king
of
cappadocia
eldest
son
the
queen
first
cousin
the
ladies
in
waiting
wore
gold
ornaments
only
one
of
them
charmian
pretty
the
queen
dropping
all
formality
was
very
lively
and
excellent
company
the
supper
was
good
the
boars
roasted
and
not
so
stiff
as
those
kind
of
entertainments
are
as
a
rule
after
supper
we
had
music
and
some
dancing
egyptian
bacchanals
who
did
a
modern
thing
called
in
very
noisy
and
not
much
tune
in
it
but
the
dancing
good
although
hardly
up
to
the
scythian
standard
mardian
who
has
a
fine
contralto
voice
he
has
been
admirably
trained
sang
a
piece
from
a
ballet
on
the
siege
of
troy
arranged
by
æschylus
very
good
i
like
those
things
much
better
they
say
conventional
and
out
of
date
but
i
do
care
the
queen
told
me
in
confidence
that
she
quite
agreed
with
me
but
that
even
classical
music
bored
her
so
after
we
had
listened
to
one
or
two
odes
she
asked
mardian
to
sing
something
light
some
songs
in
dialect
which
he
did
very
funny
especially
the
one
which
begins
as
i
was
going
to
brindisi
upon
a
summer
day
we
made
him
sing
that
one
twice
the
greeks
know
how
to
be
witty
without
even
being
in
the
least
vulgar
three
weeks
time
has
passed
very
quickly
everybody
is
being
so
kind
and
the
queen
has
taken
immense
pains
to
make
everything
a
success
most
amusing
improvised
banquet
in
fancy
dress
last
night
the
queen
disguised
as
a
she
made
me
dress
up
too
i
put
on
a
persian
private
soldier
uniform
after
supper
we
went
into
the
town
in
our
disguises
nobody
recognised
us
and
we
had
the
greatest
fun
i
threw
pieces
of
on
the
pavement
it
was
too
comic
to
see
the
old
men
trip
up
over
them
then
we
went
into
a
tavern
on
the
first
floor
and
ate
oysters
the
queen
heated
some
coppers
at
the
fire
and
after
putting
them
on
a
plate
with
a
pair
of
pincers
threw
them
out
of
the
window
it
was
quite
extraordinarily
funny
to
see
the
beggars
pick
them
up
and
then
drop
them
with
a
howl
i
do
think
i
ever
laughed
so
much
the
queen
has
a
royal
sense
of
humour
and
i
who
thought
beforehand
she
was
a
it
shows
how
mistaken
one
can
be
time
seems
to
fly
no
news
from
rome
wish
the
queen
would
not
be
quite
so
ostentatiously
lavish
on
my
account
eight
wild
boars
for
breakfast
is
too
much
and
the
other
night
at
supper
she
wasted
an
immense
pearl
in
drinking
my
health
in
vinegar
this
kind
of
thing
makes
people
talk
she
is
wonderfully
witty
she
can
mimic
exactly
the
noises
of
a
farmyard
nothing
seems
to
tire
her
either
she
will
sit
up
all
night
and
be
ready
early
the
next
morning
to
go
out
fishing
sailing
or
anything
else
she
must
have
a
constitution
of
steel
wonderful
woman
news
from
rome
fulvia
is
dead
must
go
at
once
a
month
engaged
to
be
married
to
octavia
sister
a
widow
purely
a
political
alliance
cleopatra
is
sure
to
understand
the
necessity
of
this
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
think
that
she
is
reasonable
and
has
a
real
grip
of
the
political
situation
a
month
political
situation
grows
more
and
more
complicated
octavia
is
very
dutiful
and
most
anxious
to
please
do
not
think
the
climate
here
agreeable
the
wind
is
very
sharp
and
the
nights
are
bitterly
cold
never
did
care
for
athens
think
that
if
i
went
to
egypt
for
a
few
days
i
could
benefit
by
change
of
air
arrange
matters
with
the
eastern
kings
cæsar
and
lepidus
are
trying
to
do
me
in
the
eye
a
day
octavia
has
very
kindly
offered
to
go
to
rome
so
as
to
act
as
a
between
myself
and
cæsar
she
says
she
is
quite
certain
it
is
all
only
a
misunderstanding
and
that
she
can
arrange
matters
thought
it
best
not
to
mention
possibility
of
egyptian
trip
as
i
may
not
go
after
all
back
here
once
more
after
all
doctors
all
said
change
of
air
was
essential
and
that
the
climate
of
athens
was
the
very
worst
possible
for
me
just
at
this
time
they
said
i
should
certainly
have
a
nervous
breakdown
if
i
stayed
on
much
longer
besides
which
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
be
on
the
spot
to
settle
the
eastern
question
it
is
now
fortunately
settled
cleopatra
delighted
to
see
me
but
most
reasonable
quite
understood
everything
she
did
not
say
a
word
about
octavia
reception
in
alexandria
magnificent
ovation
terrific
shows
how
right
i
was
to
come
back
settled
to
proclaim
cleopatra
queen
of
egypt
lower
syria
cyprus
and
lydia
everybody
agrees
that
this
is
only
fair
public
proclamation
in
the
market
place
settled
to
keep
media
parthia
and
armenia
in
the
family
so
divided
them
among
the
children
ceremony
went
off
splendidly
cleopatra
appeared
as
the
goddess
isis
this
was
much
appreciated
as
it
showed
the
people
she
really
is
the
cheering
was
terrific
staying
with
us
at
present
are
the
king
of
libya
the
king
of
cappadocia
the
king
of
paphlagonia
the

the
king
of
jewry
the
king
of
comagena
the
king
of
mede
and
the
king
of
lycaonia
question
of
precedence
a
little
awkward
herod
the
king
of
jewry
claimed
precedence
over
all
the
other
kings
on
the
grounds
of
antiquity
and
lineage
the
king
of
mede
contested
the
claim
and
the
king
of
arabia
said
that
he
was
the
oldest
in
years
there
is
no
doubt
about
this
as
he
is
it
was
obvious
the
first
place
belonged
to
him
question
very
neatly
settled
by
cleopatra
that
they
should
rank
according
to
the
number
of
years
they
have
reigned
she
said
this
was
the
immemorial
egyptian
custom
established
by
the
pharaohs
and
written
out
very
carefully
on
a
step
of
the
great
pyramid
everybody
satisfied
king
of
arabia
takes
precedence
but
on
account
of
his
age
herod
still
a
little
touchy
but
had
to
give
in
played
billiards
with
cleopatra
gave
her
won
with
difficulty
cæsar
is
certain
to
make
war
on
us
have
written
to
octavia
explaining
everything
fully
camp
near
nothing
doing
one
wonders
whether
cæsar
means
to
fight
after
all
the
mosquitoes
are
very
annoying
impossible
to
get
any
milk
camp
near
actium
cleopatra
has
arrived
she
is
used
to
camp
life
and
does
not
mind
roughing
it
everybody
advises
me
to
fight
on
land
and
not
by
sea
but
cleopatra
and
myself
think
we
ought
to
fight
by
sea
cæsar
has
taken
toryne
we
have
sixty
sail
the
thing
is
obvious
but
soldiers
are
always
prejudiced
enobarbus
worrying
me
to
death
to
fight
on
land
cleopatra
wo
hear
of
it
and
i
am
quite
certain
she
is
right
a
woman
instinct
in
matters
of
strategy
and
tactics
are
infallible
and
then
what
a
woman
very
glad
to
be
home
again
cleopatra
was
perfectly
right
to
retreat
played
billiards
gave
cleopatra
she
beat
me
she
will
soon
be
able
to
give
me
something
she
is
a
surprising
woman
last
night
the
greek
envoy
dined
too
clever
for
me
but
cleopatra
floored
him
over
anaxagoras
wonderful
woman
she
sang
or
rather
hummed
in
the
evening
a
little
greek
song
the
burden
of
which
is
ἐγὼ
δὲ
μόνα
καθεύδω
i
can
not
get
the
tune
out
of
my
head
xvi
from
the
diary
of
ivan
the
terrible
i
drove
to
the
village
of
o
versts
on
one
side
of
the
river
is
the
village
with
its
church
on
the
other
a
lonely
windmill
the
landscape
flat
and
brown
the
nearer
houses
and
the
distant
trees
sharp
in
the
clear
autumn
air
the
windmill
is
maimed
it
has
lost
one
of
its
wings
it
is
like
my
soul
my
soul
is
a
broken
windmill
which
is
rusty
stiff
and
maimed
it
groans
and
creaks
before
the
winds
of
god
but
it
no
longer
turns
and
no
longer
cheerfully
grumbling
as
of
yore
it
performs
its
daily
task
and
grinds
the
useful
corn
the
only
spots
of
colour
in
the
landscape
were
the
blue
cupolas
of
the
church
a
blue
and
red
shirt
hanging
up
to
dry
on
an
near
a
wooden
hut
and
the
kerchiefs
of
the
women
who
were
washing
linen
in
the
river
a
soldier
talked
to
the
women
and
laughed
with
them
i
would
that
i
could
laugh
like
that
with
men
and
women
i
can
only
laugh
alone
and
bitterly
i
had
never
been
there
before
but
when
lazily
a
cock
crew
and
a
little
boy
made
music
on
a
wooden
pipe
and
a
long
cart
laden
with
sacks
creaked
by
the
driver
walking
by
its
side
i
knew
that
i
had
seen
all
this
before
not
something
like
unto
it
but
this
very
thing
that
same
windmill
that
same
creaking
cart
that
same
little
boy
playing
that
very
tune
on
that
very
pipe
it
was
a
mournful
tune
and
it
said
to
my
soul
why
art
thou
so
dusty
and
rusty
o
my
soul
why
art
thou
sorrowful
crusted
with
suspicion
uneasy
and
fearful
prompt
to
wrath
and
slow
to
trust
inhospitable
towards
hope
and
a
stranger
to
gladness
the
world
is
a
and
i
have
satisfied
my
expectation
i
am
weary
of
the
sights
of
the
fair
and
the
mirth
of
the
crowd
to
me
is
meaningless
the
bells
and
the
tambourines
and
the
toy
trumpets
the
grating
of
the
strings
and
the
banging
of
the
drum
jar
upon
me
like
a
child
who
has
spent
a
whole
day
in
frolic
and
whose
little
strength
is
utterly
exhausted
i
desire
to
go
home
and
to
rest
rest
where
is
there
any
rest
for
thee
ivan
ivan
the
restless
everywhere
have
i
sought
for
peace
and
found
it
nowhere
save
in
a
cell
and
on
my
knees
before
the
image
why
was
i
born
to
be
a
king
why
was
i
cast
a
frail
and
fearful
infant
to
that
herd
of
ravenous
wolves
those
riotous
nobles
that
band
of
greedy
brutal
and
ruthless
villains
who
bled
my
beloved
country
and
tore
my
inheritance
into
shreds
i
think
i
know
why
i
was
sent
thither
out
of
the
weakness
came
forth
strength
a
little
boy
was
sent
forth
to
slay
the
giant
i
was
sent
to
deliver
the
russian
people
to
break
the
necks
of
the
nobles
and
to
cast
the
tyrants
from
their
stronghold
i
was
sent
to
take
the
part
of
the
people
and
they
will
never
forget
this
or
me
in
years
to
come
ages
after
i
am
dead
mothers
will
sing
their
children
to
sleep
with
songs
about
the
great
tsar
of
moscow
ivan
the
ivan
the
people
friend
ivan
the
father
of
the
fatherless
the
brother
of
the
needy
the
deliverer
of
the
oppressed
but
the
proud
and
the
mighty
the
rich
and
the
wicked
shall
hate
me
and
vilify
me
and
blacken
my
name
i
know
you
ye
vipers
and
all
your
ways
i
would
that
not
one
of
you
could
escape
me
but
like
the
hydra
you
have
a
hundred
heads
that
grow
again
as
fast
as
they
are
cut
off
when
i
am
gone
o
vile
and
poisonous
nobility
you
will
raise
your
insolent
head
once
more
and
trample
again
upon
my
beloved
people
would
that
i
could
utterly
uproot
you
from
the
holy
soil
of
russia
and
cast
you
to
perish
like
weeds
into
a
bottomless
pit
i
dreamed
last
night
a
fearful
dream
i
dreamed
that
i
had
done
an
abominable
thing
and
that
i
bore
stains
on
my
hands
that
the
snows
of
the
mountains
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
could
not
wash
out
i
dreamed
that
all
mankind
shunned
me
and
that
i
wandered
alone
across
the
great
plain
till
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
gates
of
heaven
i
knocked
at
the
gates
but
they
were
shut
and
round
me
there
was
a
multitude
and
there
arose
from
it
a
sound
of
angry
voices
crying
he
has
slain
our
fathers
and
our
brothers
and
our
mothers
by
him
our
houses
were
burnt
and
our
homes
were
laid
waste
let
him
not
enter
and
i
knocked
at
the
gate
and
then
there
came
a
man
with
a
mark
on
his
brow
and
he
said
this
man
has
killed
his
son
let
him
not
in
and
i
knew
that
man
was
cain
and
the
howling
of
the
voices
grew
louder
and
the
cries
of
hate
surging
round
me
deafened
me
i
knocked
and
prayed
and
cried
and
wept
but
the
gate
remained
shut
and
all
at
once
i
was
left
alone
in
the
great
plain
deserted
even
by
my
enemies
and
i
shivered
in
the
darkness
and
in
the
silence
then
along
the
road
came
a
pilgrim
a
poor
man
begging
for
alms
and
when
he
saw
me
he
knelt
before
me
and
i
said
wherefore
dost
thou
kneel
to
me
who
am
deserted
by
god
and
man
and
he
answered
is
not
sorrow
a
holy
thing
thou
art
the
most
sorrowful
man
in
the
whole
world
for
thou
hast
killed
what
was
dearer
to
thee
than
life
and
bitter
is
thy
sorrow
and
heavy
is
thy
punishment
and
the
pilgrim
kissed
my
hand
and
the
hot
tears
that
he
shed
fell
upon
it
and
at
that
moment
far
away
i
heard
a
noise
as
of
gates
turning
on
a
great
hinge
and
i
knew
that
the
doors
of
heaven
were
open
then
i
awoke
and
i
crept
up
the
stairway
way
to
my
little
bedroom
he
lay
sleeping
peacefully
and
i
knelt
down
and
thanked
heaven
that
the
dream
was
but
a
dream
but
when
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning
like
a
wave
from
out
of
infinity
apprehension
rolled
to
my
soul
and
settled
on
it
i
am
afraid
and
i
know
not
of
what
i
am
afraid
thanks
to
god
novgorod
is
no
more
i
have
utterly
destroyed
its
city
and
its
people
for
its
contumacy
so
fare
all
the
enemies
of
russia
and
of
moscow
xvii
from
the
private
log
of
christopher
columbus
on
board
the
at
five
in
the
morning
made
the
signal
to
weigh
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
wind
shifting
to
the
southward
and
blowing
fresh
i
furled
the
topsails
the
wind
came
in
the
afternoon
to
by
we
weighed
but
did
not
get
far
the
flood
tide
making
against
us
little
wind
or
calm
all
day
very
fine
but
now
that
we
have
started
wonder
whether
i
have
been
wise
after
all
wonder
whether
we
shall
reach
western
india
and
china
took
the
meridian
observation
at
midday
wind
northerly
with
a
great
swell
ship
company
in
good
spirits
but
the
doctor
says
we
have
started
on
a
wild
goose
chase
stood
close
in
with
the
land
at
noon
the
latitude
by
observation
was
degrees
minutes
stood
in
to
a
small
bay
to
the
southward
of
teneriffe
anchored
with
the
stream
anchor
and
sent
the
boat
for
water
went
ashore
with
the
astronomer
and
instruments
all
the
liberty
men
came
on
board
the
worse
for
liquor
which
is
on
the
whole
fortunate
as
we
shall
have
no
trouble
in
getting
them
to
continue
the
voyage
several
of
the
men
confined
with
colds
and
complain
of
pains
in
their
bones
but
from
the
careful
attendance
given
them
doses
of
skulker
mixture
being
administered
by
the
doctor
all
round
few
continued
in
the
sick
list
the
air
very
warm
thick
fog
at
five
the
officer
informed
me
that
we
were
near
an
iceberg
i
ordered
the
ship
to
be
kept
by
and
hauled
farther
in
at
noon
i
steered
north
seeing
nothing
of
the
ice
soon
after
i
was
told
that
they
saw
the
ice
i
went
upon
deck
and
perceived
something
white
upon
the
bow
and
heard
a
noise
like
the
booming
of
surf
i
hauled
down
the
studding
sails
and
hailed
the
and
the
i
desired
that
they
would
keep
close
to
us
the
fog
being
so
thick
and
have
everybody
up
ready
to
follow
our
motions
instantaneously
determining
to
stand
under
such
sail
as
should
enable
us
to
keep
the
ships
under
command
and
not
risk
parting
company
soon
afterwards
we
saw
something
on
the
bow
which
from
the
appearance
we
took
to
be
islands
and
thought
we
had
not
stood
far
enough
out
the
ship
company
raised
a
cheer
i
hauled
up
immediately
to
the
and
was
soon
undeceived
finding
it
to
be
a
sea
serpent
which
we
could
not
clear
upon
that
tack
we
tacked
immediately
but
the
wind
and
sea
both
setting
directly
upon
it
we
neared
it
very
fast
and
were
within
a
little
more
than
a
cable
length
of
the
animal
whilst
in
stays
the
doctor
who
has
always
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
the
sea
serpent
which
he
said
was
a
travellers
tale
adding
sarcastically
and
i
think
very
inconsiderately
like
the
western
passage
to
china
was
silent
all
the
evening
prefer
this
to
his
irritating
reiteration
of
that
silly
andalusian
song
and
if
we
ever
get
back
to
spain
we
will
never
never
never
go
to
sea
again
which
he
is
so
fond
of
indulging
in
sea
serpent
of
the
ordinary
kind
with
a
white
ring
round
its
neck
and
a
tufted
crest
not
so
large
as
the
icelandic
specimens
expect
to
reach
china
in
ten
days
time
should
the
weather
be
favourable
officers
and
ship
company
in
decidedly
less
good
spirits
since
the
foggy
weather
began
sea
serpent
incident
also
caused
a
good
deal
of
disappointment
the
men
being
convinced
we
had
reached
the
coast
of
china
although
i
had
repeatedly
explained
that
we
could
not
possibly
make
that
land
for
some
time
yet
lost
the
and
the
twice
in
the
night
from
the
very
thick
fog
the
situation
of
the
men
from
the
very
fatiguing
work
made
most
minute
precautions
necessary
double
allowance
of
manzanilla
served
round
no
land
in
sight
calm
all
day
with
a
great
swell
from
the
and
the
weather
remarkably
mild
confess
am
disappointed
wonder
whether
there
is
such
a
country
as
china
after
all
confess
i
have
no
satisfactory
evidence
for
thinking
so
but
am
concealing
my
anxiety
of
course
from
the
officers
and
the
doctor
who
grow
more
and
more
sarcastic
every
day
he
said
at
dinner
yesterday
that
we
might
come
home
by
the
nile
as
we
should
certainly
encounter
its
source
in
china
want
of
taste
it
is
only
too
plain
that
both
officers
and
company
are
growing
sceptical
as
to
the
practical
results
of
our
voyage
wish
the
king
and
queen
of
spain
had
been
a
little
less
sanguine
we
shall
indeed
look
very
foolish
if
we
come
back
having
accomplished
nothing
ship
company
distressingly
sulky
if
matters
continue
like
this
it
will
end
in
a
mutiny
have
been
obliged
to
fake
the
observations
measuring
the
ship
way
so
that
the
ship
company
should
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
distances
traversed
and
think
that
they
are
much
less
than
they
are
in
reality
this
faking
has
been
an
easy
task
since
the
log
being
only
a
mean
taken
every
hour
and
consequently
liable
to
error
from
the
variations
in
the
force
of
the
wind
during
the
intervals
from
which
an
arbitrary
correction
is
made
by
the
officer
of
the
watch
as
this
allowance
must
from
its
nature
be
inaccurate
it
is
very
easy
to
make
it
more
inaccurate
still
now
that
is
to
say
that
i
have
squared
roderigo
have
made
a
startling
and
disagreeable
discovery
there
is
something
wrong
or
odd
about
the
compass
the
axis
of
the
needle
no
longer
coincides
with
the
geographical
meridian
it
occupies
but
makes
an
angle
this
matter
must
be
investigated
the
ship
company
discovered
at
dawn
the
vagaries
of
the
compass
situation
alarming
they
at
once
said
we
must
go
home
doctor
and
surgeon
both
say
that
they
are
not
surprised
roderigo
has
constructed
an
instrument
hanging
by
a
universal
joint
on
a
triangular
stand
adjusted
so
as
to
hang
in
a
plane
perpendicular
to
the
horizon
by
means
of
a
plumb
line
which
is
suspended
on
a
pin
above
a
divided
circle
the
length

ingenious

everybody
expects

sometimes

we

no

convinced
personally
that
there
is
no

of
our
ever
reaching

this
voyage
i
knew
from
the
first
the
affair
was
hopeless
feel

we
can
not

unfortunately
my
conviction
which
i
have
never
expressed
is
shared
by

from

at

i
think
attained
my
desire
arrived
last
night
under
the
pseudonym
of
found
everything
fairly
satisfactory
that
is
to
say
the
promises
to
me
with
regard
to
the
absolute
solitude
i
crave
have
been
carried
out
as
far
as
was
possible
in
the
time
the
prison
is
not
finished
and
this
accounts
for
a
fact
which
annoyed
me
not
a
little
on
my
arrival
i
found
that
the
walls
of
my
room
were
not
of
the
thickness
promised
so
that
should
any
one
be
lodged
next
door
to
me
which
heaven
forfend
he
might
have
the
bad
taste
to
try
and
communicate
with
me
by
knocking
on
the
wall
i
wear
a
black
velvet
mask
and
the
king
solemnly
promised
me
that
if
any
officer
were
to
dare
to
ask
me
who
i
was
he
would
be
instantly
dismissed
so
far
so
good
saint
mars
the
governor
of
the
prison
is
certainly
doing
his
best
but
last
night
when
he
brought
me
my
dinner
he
forgot
himself
and
said
bon
soir
monsieur
if
he
does
this
again
he
will
have
to
be
removed
i
did
not
come
here
to
be
bothered
with
conversation
i
am
enjoying
myself
immensely
the
relief
of
waking
up
in
the
morning
and
of
gradually
becoming
conscious
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
dress
in
court
clothes
to
go
out
hunting
to
attend
the
king
or
still
worse
his
to
play
cards
and
lose
to
listen
to
a
play
performed
in
a
private
house
to
laugh
at
madame
chaff
to
make
love
to
j
to
pretend
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
nature
to
hear
and
give
opinions
on
molière
to
sit
through
the
long
long
dinner
to
talk
philosophy
with
mademoiselle
to
find
fault
with
my
servant
for
giving
me
the
wrong
stockings
to
wait
for
hours
in
the
crown
of
the
to
be
taken
to
the
window
by
the
english
ambassador
and
asked
if
i
think
the
spaniards
really
mean
business
to
talk
internal
politics
with
louvois
to
listen
to
le
nôtre
account
of
lord
carlisle
new
garden
to
listen
to
bossuet
sermon
on
sunday
not
to
annoy
the
duchesse
de
la
vallière
to
have
to
look
as
if
i
thought
the
king
an
amusing
conversationalist
to
say
that
a
is
great
fun
to
go
to
the
opera
at
the
back
of
a
box
to
pretend
i
like
dutch
pictures
to
dance
all
night
in
a
room
like
a
monkey
cage
to
read
the
gazette
to
be
civil
to
the
german
ambassadress
to
change
my
clothes
three
times
a
day
that
is
my
alphabet
of
negation
it
is
incomplete
yet
to
write
it
and
read
it
over
and
over
again
fills
me
with
ecstasy
a
most
annoying
incident
happened
the
upper
tower
at
the
western
angle
of
the
castle
is
occupied
by
fouquet
and
lauzun
the
king
promised
me
solemnly
that
neither
of
them
should
be
allowed
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
one
of
servants
entered
my
room
and
spoke
to
me
asking
me
whether
i
had
anything
of
importance
to
communicate
i
told
him
very
sharply
to
go
to
the
devil
if
this
happens
again
i
shall
ask
to
be
moved
to
a
quieter
prison
it
is
extraordinary
that
even
in
a
place
like
this
one
can
not
be
free
from
the
importunity
and
the
impertinence
of
human
curiosity
as
the
days
go
on
i
enjoy
myself
more
and
more
a
cargo
of
books
arrived
yesterday
from
paris
sent
by
the
king
but
saint
mars
had
the
good
sense
not
to
bring
them
to
me
he
merely
notified
the
fact
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
he
left
on
my
plate
i
scribbled
a
note
to
the
effect
that
he
could
throw
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
read
them
himself
or
give
them
to
fouquet
servant
books
indeed
it
is
no
longer
thank
god
necessary
for
me
to
read
books
or
to
have
an
opinion
on
them
lauzun
has
been
sent
here
the
prison
is
getting
far
too
crowded
it
will
soon
be
as
bad
as
versailles
lauzun
is
being
very
tiresome
he
taps
on
my
ceiling
i
wrote
a
short
note
to
saint
mars
that
if
this
annoyance
continued
i
should
be
constrained
to
leave
his
prison
the
situation
was
intolerable
lauzun
and
fouquet
found
some
means
of
communication
and
they
carried
on
interminable
conversations
what
they
can
have
to
talk
about
passes
my
understanding
i
bore
it
patiently
for
some
days
at
last
i
complained
to
saint
mars
in
writing
he
took
some
steps
and
it
appears
that
fouquet
has
had
an
attack
of
apoplexy
and
died
i
can
not
endure
the
neighbourhood
of
lauzun
and
i
have
written
to
the
king
saying
that
unless
i
am
transferred
to
a
quieter
dungeon
i
shall
leave
the
prison
matters
have
been
arranged
satisfactorily
and
i
have
been
moved
into
the
lower
chamber
of
the
but
the
whole
fortress
is
far
too
crowded
there
are
at
least
five
prisoners
in
it
also
i
found
a
tame
mouse
here
left
i
suppose
by
a
former
occupant
had
the
nuisance
removed
at
once
it
is
delicious
to
be
safely
in
prison
just
now
that
the
spring
is
beginning
and
to
think
that
i
shall
not
have
to
spend
chilly
evenings
in
wet
gardens
and
to
speak
foolishly
of
the
damp
april
weather
caused
much
annoyance
by
a
tiresome
italian
fellow
prisoner
called
mattioli
who
feigning
either
madness
or
illness
or
both
caused
a
commotion
in
the
prison
necessitating
the
arrival
of
doctors
and
priests
kept
awake
by
noise
of
bolts
being
drawn
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
wrote
to
the
king
complaining
of
this
which
is
a
direct
infringement
of
his
promise
asked
to
be
moved
to
a
quieter
spot
moved
to
the
fortress
of
exiles
prison
said
to
be
empty
hope
this
will
prove
true
saint
mars
very
nearly
spoke
to
me
he
was
evidently
bursting
with
something
he
longed
to
communicate
however
i
made
such
a
gesture
that
i
think
he
felt
the
frown
through
my
velvet
mask
and
withdrew
after
months
and
indeed
years
of
peace
perfect
peace
with
loved
ones
far
away
i
have
again
been
subjected
to
intolerable
annoyance
fouquet
valet
fell
ill
and
mars
informed
me
of
the
i
wrote
to
the
king
at
once
saying
that
either
saint
mars
or
i
must
go
king
has
granted
my
request
arrived
at
sainte
marguerite
in
a
chair
with
wheels
covered
with
i
think
i
shall
be
quieter
here
i
have
been
promised
that
no
other
prisoner
shall
be
lodged
here
at
all
but
the
promises
of
kings
are
as
iridescent
and
as
brittle
as
venetian
glass
alas
alas
for
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
here
i
was
perfectly
contented
and
as
i
thought
quiet
at
last
day
followed
day
of
perfect
enjoyment
unmarred
by
conversation
undisturbed
by
study
unvexed
by
the
elements
when
the
peace
of
my
solitude
is
rudely
shattered
by
the
arrival
of
two
protestant
ministers
it
is
true
i
am
never
to
see
them
but
the
mere
fact
of
knowing
that
there
are
two
protestant
ministers
in
the
same
building
is
enough
to
poison
life
more
protestant
ministers
have
arrived
worse
than
the
last
they
sing
hymns
i
have
written
to
the
king
asking
him
to
transfer
me
to
the
bastille
at
once
i
always
said
that
the
bastille
was
the
only
tolerable
in
france
arrived
at
the
bastille
this
afternoon
lodged
on
the
third
floor
of
the
tower
the
tower
really
quiet
a
man
hammered
over
my
head
at
four
this
morning
it
is
intolerable
shall
i
ever
find
a
place
where
i
can
sleep
from
to
without
being
disturbed
as
it
is
i
might
just
as
well
be
living
in
a
fashionable
inn
xix
from
the
diary
of
an
english
governess
residing
in
paris
during
the
french
revolution
i
arrived
this
afternoon
after
a
rapid
and
satisfactory
journey
to
my
amazement
found
that
neither
the
count
nor
the
countess
were
here
to
receive
me
the
hotel
was
deserted
save
for
the
presence
of
an
old
servant
and
his
wife
who
appears
to
be
the
cook
of
the
household
and
to
combine
with
this
office
the
duties
of
hall
porter
as
i
have
no
command
over
even
the
elementary
rudiments
of
the
french
language
and
as
the
french
never
trouble
to
learn
any
language
but
their
own
communication
is
a
sorely
difficult
task
and
results
in
perpetual
misunderstanding
nevertheless
i
succeeded
in
apprehending
from
the
voluble
expostulations
and
the
superfluous
gesticulation
of
the
old
servant
whose
name
appears
to
be
pierre
but
whom
i
have
decided
to
call
peter
that
the
family
had
left
paris
that
they
had
departed
but
recently
and
in
haste
my
senses
were
able
to
inform
me
all
over
the
house
were
traces
of
disorder
some
but
boxes
had
been
left
behind
cupboards
were
open
clothes
were
strewn
on
the
floor
and
everywhere
traces
of
precipitate
packing
and
sudden
departure
were
manifest
i
made
as
if
i
would
depart
also
but
peter
made
it
plain
by
signs
that
i
was
expected
to
remain
and
indeed
he
conducted
me
to
my
room
which
is
airy
and
commodious
enough
and
where
after
partaking
of
a
light
supper
insufficient
and
badly
cooked
as
all
french
meals
and
accompanied
by
the
sour
wine
of
the
country
i
fell
into
a
comfortable
slumber
i
have
now
been
here
three
days
and
as
yet
i
have
received
neither
message
nor
token
nor
sign
from
the
departed
family
nor
can
i
ascertain
from
peter
or
his
wife
the
obtuse
menials
who
are
the
sole
occupants
of
this
in
some
respects
elegant
mansion
whither
they
have
gone
whether
they
are
loitering
in
their
country
seat
or
whether
they
have
started
on
a
longer
peregrination
paris
is
very
full
the
streets
are
and
a
strange
contrast
to
the
blaze
at
night
and
tidiness
by
day
of
the
london
streets
it
is
a
dingy
city
and
i
think
it
must
certainly
be
insanitary
the
french
understand
no
word
of
english
and
if
indeed
one
ventures
to
address
them
all
they
reply
is
rosbeef
plom
pudding
a
form
of
address
which
they
consider
facetious
the
house
is
spacious
enough
although
inconveniently
distant
from
the
centre
of
the
city
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
an
extensive
garden
surrounded
by
high
walls
as
for
myself
i
am
well
cared
for
by
peter
and
his
wife
she
talks
at
me
with
great
volubility
but
i
can
not
understand
a
word
of
what
she
says
french
is
an
unmusical
language
very
sharp
and
nasal
but
not
to
a
backward
people
went
for
a
long
walk
in
the
city
the
streets
quiet
and
deserted
peter
and
his
wife
went
out
for
the
day
she
is
very
handy
with
her
needle
i
find
altogether
that
the
french
are
quite
amenable
to
reason
if
well
treated
of
course
one
can
not
expect
them
to
work
like
english
people
but
they
are
willing
and
do
their
best
it
is
unfortunate
they
do
not
speak
english
received
last
quarter
salary
through
the
usual
channel
no
further

went
out
in
the
evening
with
peter
and
his
wife
they
took
me
to
the
opera
house
having
apparently
received
tickets
from
a
friend
connected
with
theatrical
affairs
and
was
the
name
of
the
opera
the
scenery
was
gorgeous
and
the
ballets
very
skilfully
performed
the
opera
was
given
in
french
so
that
i
could
not
follow
the
words
weather
grey
and
dark
boulevards
as
usual
but
crowded
with
people
coming
from
the
the
theatres
and
the
dining
houses
all
singing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
returned
home
between
nine
and
ten
again
to
the
opera
house
to
hear
the
of
gluck
and
to
see
the
celebrated
vestris
dance
in

ballet

unpleasing

near

caught
in

obliged
to
follow
with

borne
by
the
force
of
the

right
into

deeply
shocked
and
disgusted
at

resembling
a

actress
throned
near

representing
no

most
reprehensible

peter

spent
much
time
in

from

rapid

unintelligible
jargon
that
she
wished

to
see
a
doctor
shook
my
head
vehemently
shall
certainly
not
put
myself
in
the
hands
of
a
french
doctor
one
never
knows
what
foreigners
may
prescribe
came
downstairs
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
been
laid
up
made
many
good
resolutions
for
the
new
year
among
others
to
keep
my
journal
more
diligently
walked
in
the
garden
for
the
first
time
since
my
relapse
peter
wife
has
nursed
me
with
much
care
and
tenderness
still
very
weak
first
walk
in
the
city
since
my
long
illness
feel
really
better
bought
a
lace
kerchief
the
family
that
is
to
say
the
countess
and
her
two
daughters
arrived
unexpectedly
in
the
night
countess
simple
and
kindly
can
scarcely
speak
any
english
begin
lessons
the
eldest
girl
amelia
aged
seven
speaks
english
but
has
been
shamefully
during
her
stay
in
england
for
it
appears
the
family
have
been
in
england
she
is
sadly
backward
in
spelling
but
she
has
a
fair
accent
and
is
evidently
an
intelligent
child
unfortunately
she
has
picked
up
many
unseemly
expressions
the
countess
suggested
my
learning
french
but
i
respectfully
declined
reading
pope
on
in
the
evenings
it
is
improving
as
well
as
elegant
xx
from
the
diary
of
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
during
his
stay
at
england
whither
he
was
sent
to
study
at
the
university
at
oxford
under
the
special
care
of
polonius
college
read
aloud
my
essay
on
equality
to
the
master
it
began
treat
all
men
as
your
equals
especially
the
rich
the
master
commented
on
this
sentence
he
said
very
ribald
prince
hamlet
very
ribald
in
training
for
the
annual
fencing
match
between
the
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
doing
my
utmost
to
reduce
my
flesh
which
is
far
too
solid
went
to
abingdon
for
the
day
when
i
came
back
i
found
that
havoc
had
been
made
of
my
rooms
both
the
virginals
broken
to
pieces
all
the
furniture
destroyed
and
all
my
pictures
including
a
signed
portrait
of
ophelia
have
my
suspicions
as
to
who
has
done
this
shall
first
make
certain
and
then
retaliate
terribly
in
the
meantime
it
will
be
politic
to
conceal
my
annoyance
dined
last
night
with
a
society
of
undergraduates
who
meet
together
in
a
barn
to
discuss
falconry
and
french
verse
rhenish
wine
served
in
great
quantities
feigned
drunkenness
in
order
to
discover
who
was
guilty
of
taking
liberties
with
my
furniture
as
i
suspected
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
were
the
culprits
they
as
good
as
admitted
it
in
their
cups
intend
to
be
revenged
some
day
and
that
royally
when
we
returned
home
from
the
barn
last
night
it
was
of
course
necessary
for
me
to
keep
up
the
false
semblance
of
intoxication
with
which
i
had
started
the
evening
this
i
did
by
improvising
and
singing
quaint
rhymeless
couplets
as
we
strutted
across
the
quadrangle
of
the
college
it
so
chanced
that
we
encountered
the
dean
who
addressed
me
i
answered
keeping
up
the
part
buzz
buzz
a
college
meeting
was
held
this
morning
and
i
was
summoned
to
appear
on
the
charges
of
having
been
intoxicated
of
having
insulted
the
dean
of
having
persuaded
and
finally
compelled
the
younger
members
of
the
college
to
drink
more
than
was
good
for
them
to
which
i
replied
a
that
seeing
that
i
was
in
strict
training
it
was
obvious
that
the
charge
of
intoxication
was
unfounded
that
so
far
from
insulting
the
dean
i
had
addressed
him
in
danish
and
that
familiar
as
i
knew
him
to
be
with
all
the
languages
of
europe
and
especially
the
scandinavian
tongues
he
had
probably
not
realized
to
the
full
the
exact
shade
of
deference
respect
and
awe
which
the
expression
i
used
implied
that
as
far
as
the
charge
of
corrupting
the
young
was
concerned
i
was
not
ashamed
to
stand
in
the
same
dock
with
socrates
and
i
would
cheerfully
if
the
college
authorities
and
my
royal
parents
thought
fit
share
the
doom
of
my
august
master
finally
i
reminded
the
noble
and
learned
assembly
that
were
i
to
be
expelled
even
temporarily
from
the
college
i
should
be
unable
to
represent
the
with
the
rapier
against
the
university
of
cambridge
who
had
a
powerful
champion
of
the
noble
art
in
laertes
a
of
mine
and
i
should
not
be
able
to
row
in
the
college
boat
i
concluded
by
saying
that
certain
as
i
was
that
my
royal
parents
would
endorse
any
decision
which
should
be
arrived
at
by
the
master
and
his
colleagues
i
was
convinced
that
were
i
to
be
sent
down
from
the
college
my
royal
father
in
order
that
my
studies
might
not
be
interrupted
would
immediately
send
me
to
cambridge
the
net
result
of
all
this
is
that
i
am
admonished
later
in
the
day
i
received
a
note
from
the
dean
asking
me
to
dine
with
him
next
thursday
breakfasted
with
the
master
to
meet
the
poet
laureate
the
archbishop
of
york
the
lord
chancellor
the
french
ambassador
and
quattrovalli
a
celebrated
italian
juggler
the
poet
laureate
read
out
an
ode
he
had
just
composed
on
the
king
sixth
marriage
very
poor
took
part
in
the
debate
held
by
the
college
debating
society
the
subject
being
whether
homer
epics
were
written
by
homer
or
by
a
committee
of
athenian
dons
took
what
seemed
to
the
audience
a
paradoxical
view
that
they
were
written
by
homer
gave
a
small
dinner
party
in
my
rooms
horatio
and
a
few
others
again
compelled
to
feign
intoxication
so
as
not
to
mar
the
harmony
of
the
evening
burnt
a
small
organ
and
rather
a
complicated
printing
press
belonging
to
a
german
undergraduate
named
faustus
in
the
quadrangle
the
master
commenting
on
last
night
bonfire
said
he
thought
it
was
not
humorous
and
fined
us
heavily
have
as
yet
found
no
opportunity
of
revenging
myself
on
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
coached
by
polonius
for
two
hours
in
scottish
history
very
tedious
in
the
afternoon
went
on
the
river
in
my
boat
the
ophelia
faustus
has
been
sent
down
for
trying
to
raise
the
devil
in
the
precincts
of
the
college
it
appears
this
is
strictly
against
the
rules
his
excuse
was
that
he
had
always
understood
that
the
college
authorities
disbelieved
in
a
personal
devil
to
which
the
dean
replied
we
are
all
bound
to
believe
in
the
devil
in
a
sense
mr
faustus
and
faustus
imprudently
asked
in
what
other
sense
you
could
believe
in
him
must
really
settle
this
business
of
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
soon
it
is
beginning
to
prey
upon
my
mind
they
are
quite
insufferable
have
lost
one
stone
since
the
term
began
which
is
satisfactory
fencing
match
is
to
take
place
next
week
here
the
man
who
has
the
rooms
opposite
mine
is
a
spaniard
a
nobleman
very
cultivated
and
amiable
his
name
is
quixote
consulted
him
last
night
as
to
what
to
do
about
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
quixote
said
it
was
entirely
a
point
of
honour
that
if
i
were
certain
they
were
guilty
and
certain
likewise
that
they
had
purposely
insulted
me
i
should
challenge
them
each
separately
to
personal
combat
with
sword
and
rapier
i
pointed
out
however
that
whereas
i
was
a
champion
swordsman
and
indeed
had
been
chosen
to
represent
the
university
they
had
no
skill
at
all
moreover
i
considered
that
to
challenge
them
to
fight
would
be
doing
them
too
much
honour
quixote
said
i
must
indubitably
take
action
of
some
kind
or
else
i
would
incur
the
suspicion
of
cowardice
at
that
moment
we
were
talking
by
the
open
casement
i
saw
in
the
darkness
walking
stealthily
along
the
wall
a
man
whom
i
took
to
be
guildenstern
seizing
a
bottle
of
white
wine
from
xeres
with
which
quixote
had
entertained
me
i
flung
it
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
head
of
the
skulker
but
alas
it
was
not
guildenstern
but
the
dean
himself
again
appeared
before
a
college
meeting
accused
of
having
wantonly
wounded
and
almost
murdered
the
dean
protested
my
innocence
in
vain
it
was
further
suggested
i
was
intoxicated
lost
my
temper
which
was
a
mistake
and
called
the
dean
a
villain
losing
control
over
my
epithets
sent
down
for
the
rest
of
the
term
polonius
is
very
angry
he
has
written
to
my
father
suggesting
that
i
should
not
go
back
to
oxford
nor
seek
to
enter
cambridge
either
but
go
to
wittenberg
instead
owing
to
my
abrupt
departure
the
fencing
match
with
laertes
will
not
come
oft
no
matter
a
day
will
come
when
maybe
i
shall
be
revenged
on
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
we
go
to
london
