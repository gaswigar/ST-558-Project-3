an
international
episode
by
henry
james
part
i
four
years
ago
in
two
young
englishmen
had
occasion
to
go
to
the
united
states
they
crossed
the
ocean
at
midsummer
and
arriving
in
new
york
on
the
first
day
of
august
were
much
struck
with
the
fervid
temperature
of
that
city
disembarking
upon
the
wharf
they
climbed
into
one
of
those
huge
coaches
which
convey
passengers
to
the
hotels
and
with
a
great
deal
of
bouncing
and
bumping
took
their
course
through
broadway
the
midsummer
aspect
of
new
york
is
not
perhaps
the
most
favorable
one
still
it
is
not
without
its
picturesque
and
even
brilliant
side
nothing
could
well
resemble
less
a
typical
english
street
than
the
interminable
avenue
rich
in
incongruities
through
which
our
two
travelers
advanced
looking
out
on
each
side
of
them
at
the
comfortable
animation
of
the
sidewalks
the
heterogeneous
architecture
the
huge
white
marble
facades
glittering
in
the
strong
crude
light
and
bedizened
with
gilded
lettering
the
multifarious
awnings
banners
and
streamers
the
extraordinary
number
of
omnibuses
horsecars
and
other
democratic
vehicles
the
vendors
of
cooling
fluids
the
white
trousers
and
big
straw
hats
of
the
policemen
the
tripping
gait
of
the
modish
young
persons
on
the
pavement
the
general
brightness
newness
juvenility
both
of
people
and
things
the
young
men
had
exchanged
few
observations
but
in
crossing
union
square
in
front
of
the
monument
to
washington
in
the
very
shadow
indeed
projected
by
the
image
of
the
pater
patriae
one
of
them
remarked
to
the
other
it
seems
a
ah
very
odd
very
odd
said
the
other
who
was
the
clever
man
of
the
two
pity
it
s
so
beastly
hot
resumed
the
first
speaker
after
a
pause
you
know
we
are
in
a
low
latitude
said
his
friend
i
daresay
remarked
the
other
i
wonder
said
the
second
speaker
presently
if
they
can
give
one
a
bath
i
daresay
not
rejoined
the
other
oh
i
say
cried
his
comrade
this
animated
discussion
was
checked
by
their
arrival
at
the
hotel
which
had
been
recommended
to
them
by
an
american
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
they
made
with
whom
indeed
they
became
very
intimate
on
the
steamer
and
who
had
proposed
to
accompany
them
to
the
inn
and
introduce
them
in
a
friendly
way
to
the
proprietor
this
plan
however
had
been
defeated
by
their
friend
s
finding
that
his
partner
was
awaiting
him
on
the
wharf
and
that
his
commercial
associate
desired
him
instantly
to
come
and
give
his
attention
to
certain
telegrams
received
from
louis
but
the
two
englishmen
with
nothing
but
their
national
prestige
and
personal
graces
to
recommend
them
were
very
well
received
at
the
hotel
which
had
an
air
of
capacious
hospitality
they
found
that
a
bath
was
not
unattainable
and
were
indeed
struck
with
the
facilities
for
prolonged
and
reiterated
immersion
with
which
their
apartment
was
supplied
after
bathing
a
good
deal
more
indeed
than
they
had
ever
done
before
on
a
single
occasion
they
made
their
way
into
the
dining
room
of
the
hotel
which
was
a
spacious
restaurant
with
a
fountain
in
the
middle
a
great
many
tall
plants
in
ornamental
tubs
and
an
array
of
french
waiters
the
first
dinner
on
land
after
a
sea
voyage
is
under
any
circumstances
a
delightful
occasion
and
there
was
something
particularly
agreeable
in
the
circumstances
in
which
our
young
englishmen
found
themselves
they
were
extremely
good
natured
young
men
they
were
more
observant
than
they
appeared
in
a
sort
of
inarticulate
accidentally
dissimulative
fashion
they
were
highly
appreciative
this
was
perhaps
especially
the
case
with
the
elder
who
was
also
as
i
have
said
the
man
of
talent
they
sat
down
at
a
little
table
which
was
a
very
different
affair
from
the
great
clattering
seesaw
in
the
saloon
of
the
steamer
the
wide
doors
and
windows
of
the
restaurant
stood
open
beneath
large
awnings
to
a
wide
pavement
where
there
were
other
plants
in
tubs
and
rows
of
spreading
trees
and
beyond
which
there
was
a
large
shady
square
without
any
palings
and
with
walks
and
above
the
vivid
verdure
rose
other
facades
of
white
marble
and
of
pale
stone
squaring
themselves
against
the
deep
blue
sky
here
outside
in
the
light
and
the
shade
and
the
heat
there
was
a
great
tinkling
of
the
bells
of
innumerable
streetcars
and
a
constant
strolling
and
shuffling
and
rustling
of
many
pedestrians
a
large
proportion
of
whom
were
young
women
in
dresses
within
the
place
was
cool
and
vaguely
lighted
with
the
plash
of
water
the
odor
of
flowers
and
the
flitting
of
french
waiters
as
i
have
said
upon
soundless
carpets
it
s
rather
like
paris
you
know
said
the
younger
of
our
two
travelers
it
s
like
paris
only
more
so
his
companion
rejoined
i
suppose
it
s
the
french
waiters
said
the
first
speaker
why
don
t
they
have
french
waiters
in
london
fancy
a
french
waiter
at
a
club
said
his
friend
the
young
englishman
started
a
little
as
if
he
could
not
fancy
it
in
paris
i
m
very
apt
to
dine
at
a
place
where
there
s
an
english
waiter
don
t
you
know
what
s
close
to
the
thingumbob
they
always
set
an
english
waiter
at
me
i
suppose
they
think
i
can
t
speak
well
you
can
and
the
elder
of
the
young
englishmen
unfolded
his
napkin
his
companion
took
no
notice
whatever
of
this
declaration
i
say
he
resumed
in
a
moment
i
suppose
we
must
learn
to
speak
american
i
suppose
we
must
take
i
can
t
understand
them
said
the
clever
man
what
the
deuce
is
he
saying
asked
his
comrade
appealing
from
the
french
waiter
he
is
recommending
some
crabs
said
the
clever
man
and
so
in
desultory
observation
of
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
new
society
in
which
they
found
themselves
the
young
englishmen
proceeded
to
dine
going
in
largely
as
the
phrase
is
for
cooling
draughts
and
dishes
of
which
their
attendant
offered
them
a
very
long
list
after
dinner
they
went
out
and
slowly
walked
about
the
neighboring
streets
the
early
dusk
of
waning
summer
was
coming
on
but
the
heat
was
still
very
great
the
pavements
were
hot
even
to
the
stout
boot
soles
of
the
british
travelers
and
the
trees
along
the
curbstone
emitted
strange
exotic
odors
the
young
men
wandered
through
the
adjoining
square
that
queer
place
without
palings
and
with
marble
walks
arranged
in
black
and
white
lozenges
there
were
a
great
many
benches
crowded
with
people
and
the
travelers
remarked
very
justly
that
it
was
not
much
like
belgrave
square
on
one
side
was
an
enormous
hotel
lifting
up
into
the
hot
darkness
an
immense
array
of
open
brightly
lighted
windows
at
the
base
of
this
populous
structure
was
an
eternal
jangle
of
horsecars
and
all
round
it
in
the
upper
dusk
was
a
sinister
hum
of
mosquitoes
the
ground
floor
of
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
a
huge
transparent
cage
flinging
a
wide
glare
of
gaslight
into
the
street
of
which
it
formed
a
sort
of
public
adjunct
absorbing
and
emitting
the
passersby
promiscuously
the
young
englishmen
went
in
with
everyone
else
from
curiosity
and
saw
a
couple
of
hundred
men
sitting
on
divans
along
a
great
corridor
with
their
legs
stretched
out
together
with
several
dozen
more
standing
in
a
queue
as
at
the
ticket
office
of
a
railway
station
before
a
brilliantly
illuminated
counter
of
vast
extent
these
latter
persons
who
carried
portmanteaus
in
their
hands
had
a
dejected
exhausted
look
their
garments
were
not
very
fresh
and
they
seemed
to
be
rendering
some
mysterious
tribute
to
a
magnificent
young
man
with
a
waxed
mustache
and
a
shirtfront
adorned
with
diamond
buttons
who
every
now
and
then
dropped
an
absent
glance
over
their
multitudinous
patience
they
were
american
citizens
doing
homage
to
a
hotel
clerk
i
m
glad
he
didn
t
tell
us
to
go
there
said
one
of
our
englishmen
alluding
to
their
friend
on
the
steamer
who
had
told
them
so
many
things
they
walked
up
the
fifth
avenue
where
for
instance
he
had
told
them
that
all
the
first
families
lived
but
the
first
families
were
out
of
town
and
our
young
travelers
had
only
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
some
of
the
second
or
perhaps
even
the
third
taking
the
evening
air
upon
balconies
and
high
flights
of
doorsteps
in
the
streets
which
radiate
from
the
more
ornamental
thoroughfare
they
went
a
little
way
down
one
of
these
side
streets
and
they
saw
young
ladies
in
white
dresses
persons
seated
in
graceful
attitudes
on
the
steps
in
one
or
two
places
these
young
ladies
were
conversing
across
the
street
with
other
young
ladies
seated
in
similar
postures
and
costumes
in
front
of
the
opposite
houses
and
in
the
warm
night
air
their
colloquial
tones
sounded
strange
in
the
ears
of
the
young
englishmen
one
of
our
friends
nevertheless
the
younger
one
intimated
that
he
felt
a
disposition
to
interrupt
a
few
of
these
soft
familiarities
but
his
companion
observed
pertinently
enough
that
he
had
better
be
careful
we
must
not
begin
with
making
mistakes
said
his
companion
but
he
told
us
you
know
he
told
us
urged
the
young
man
alluding
again
to
the
friend
on
the
steamer
never
mind
what
he
told
us
answered
his
comrade
who
if
he
had
greater
talents
was
also
apparently
more
of
a
moralist
by
bedtime
in
their
impatience
to
taste
of
a
terrestrial
couch
again
our
seafarers
went
to
bed
early
it
was
still
insufferably
hot
and
the
buzz
of
the
mosquitoes
at
the
open
windows
might
have
passed
for
an
audible
crepitation
of
the
temperature
we
can
t
stand
this
you
know
the
young
englishmen
said
to
each
other
and
they
tossed
about
all
night
more
boisterously
than
they
had
tossed
upon
the
atlantic
billows
on
the
morrow
their
first
thought
was
that
they
would
that
day
for
england
and
then
it
occured
to
them
that
they
might
find
an
asylum
nearer
at
hand
the
cave
of
aeolus
became
their
ideal
of
comfort
and
they
wondered
where
the
americans
went
when
they
wished
to
cool
off
they
had
not
the
least
idea
and
they
determined
to
apply
for
information
to
westgate
this
was
the
name
inscribed
in
a
bold
hand
on
the
back
of
a
letter
carefully
preserved
in
the
pocketbook
of
our
junior
traveler
beneath
the
address
in
the
corner
of
the
envelope
were
the
words
introducing
lord
lambeth
and
percy
beaumont
the
letter
had
been
given
to
the
two
englishmen
by
a
good
friend
of
theirs
in
london
who
had
been
in
america
two
years
previously
and
had
singled
out
westgate
from
the
many
friends
he
had
left
there
as
the
consignee
as
it
were
of
his
compatriots
he
is
a
capital
fellow
the
englishman
in
london
had
said
and
he
has
got
an
awfully
pretty
wife
he
s
tremendously
hospitable
he
will
do
everything
in
the
world
for
you
and
as
he
knows
everyone
over
there
it
is
quite
needless
i
should
give
you
any
other
introduction
he
will
make
you
see
everyone
trust
to
him
for
putting
you
into
circulation
he
has
got
a
tremendously
pretty
it
was
natural
that
in
the
hour
of
tribulation
lord
lambeth
and
percy
beaumont
should
have
bethought
themselves
of
a
gentleman
whose
attractions
had
been
thus
vividly
depicted
all
the
more
so
that
he
lived
in
the
fifth
avenue
and
that
the
fifth
avenue
as
they
had
ascertained
the
night
before
was
contiguous
to
their
hotel
ten
to
one
he
ll
be
out
of
town
said
percy
beaumont
but
we
can
at
least
find
out
where
he
has
gone
and
we
can
immediately
start
in
pursuit
he
can
t
possibly
have
gone
to
a
hotter
place
you
oh
there
s
only
one
hotter
place
said
lord
lambeth
and
i
hope
he
hasn
t
gone
they
strolled
along
the
shady
side
of
the
street
to
the
number
indicated
upon
the
precious
letter
the
house
presented
an
imposing
expanse
relieved
by
facings
and
window
cornices
of
florid
sculpture
and
by
a
couple
of
dusty
rose
trees
which
clambered
over
the
balconies
and
the
portico
this
feature
was
approached
by
a
monumental
flight
of
steps
rather
better
than
a
london
house
said
lord
lambeth
looking
down
from
this
altitude
after
they
had
rung
the
bell
it
depends
upon
what
london
house
you
mean
replied
his
companion
you
have
a
tremendous
chance
to
get
wet
between
the
house
door
and
your
well
said
lord
lambeth
glancing
at
the
burning
heavens
i
guess
it
doesn
t
rain
so
much
here
the
door
was
opened
by
a
long
negro
in
a
white
jacket
who
grinned
familiarly
when
lord
lambeth
asked
for
westgate
he
ain
t
at
home
sah
he
s
downtown
at
his
o
oh
at
his
office
said
the
visitors
and
when
will
he
be
at
home
well
sah
when
he
goes
out
dis
way
in
de
mo
ning
he
ain
t
liable
to
come
home
all
this
was
discouraging
but
the
address
of
westgate
s
office
was
freely
imparted
by
the
intelligent
black
and
was
taken
down
by
percy
beaumont
in
his
pocketbook
the
two
gentlemen
then
returned
languidly
to
their
hotel
and
sent
for
a
hackney
coach
and
in
this
commodious
vehicle
they
rolled
comfortably
downtown
they
measured
the
whole
length
of
broadway
again
and
found
it
a
path
of
fire
and
then
deflecting
to
the
left
they
were
deposited
by
their
conductor
before
a
fresh
light
ornamental
structure
ten
stories
high
in
a
street
crowded
with
young
men
who
were
running
about
very
quickly
and
stopping
each
other
eagerly
at
corners
and
in
doorways
passing
into
this
brilliant
building
they
were
introduced
by
one
of
the
young
men
he
was
a
charming
fellow
in
wonderful
garments
and
a
hat
with
a
blue
ribbon
who
had
evidently
perceived
them
to
be
aliens
and
helpless
to
a
very
snug
hydraulic
elevator
in
which
they
took
their
place
with
many
other
persons
and
which
shooting
upward
in
its
vertical
socket
presently
projected
them
into
the
seventh
horizontal
compartment
of
the
edifice
here
after
brief
delay
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
friend
of
their
friend
in
london
his
office
was
composed
of
several
different
rooms
and
they
waited
very
silently
in
one
of
them
after
they
had
sent
in
their
letter
and
their
cards
the
letter
was
not
one
which
it
would
take
westgate
very
long
to
read
but
he
came
out
to
speak
to
them
more
instantly
than
they
could
have
expected
he
had
evidently
jumped
up
from
his
work
he
was
a
tall
lean
personage
and
was
dressed
all
in
fresh
white
linen
he
had
a
thin
sharp
familiar
face
with
an
expression
that
was
at
one
and
the
same
time
sociable
and
businesslike
a
quick
intelligent
eye
and
a
large
brown
mustache
which
concealed
his
mouth
and
made
his
chin
beneath
it
look
small
lord
lambeth
thought
he
looked
tremendously
clever
how
do
you
do
lord
lambeth
how
do
you
do
sir
he
said
holding
the
open
letter
in
his
hand
i
m
very
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
you
re
very
well
you
had
better
come
in
here
i
think
it
s
cooler
and
he
led
the
way
into
another
room
where
there
were
law
books
and
papers
and
windows
wide
open
beneath
striped
awning
just
opposite
one
of
the
windows
on
a
line
with
his
eyes
lord
lambeth
observed
the
weathervane
of
a
church
steeple
the
uproar
of
the
street
sounded
infinitely
far
below
and
lord
lambeth
felt
very
high
in
the
air
i
say
it
s
cooler
pursued
their
host
but
everything
is
relative
how
do
you
stand
the
heat
i
can
t
say
we
like
it
said
lord
lambeth
but
beaumont
likes
it
better
than
well
it
won
t
last
westgate
very
cheerfully
declared
nothing
unpleasant
lasts
over
here
it
was
very
hot
when
captain
littledale
was
here
he
did
nothing
but
drink
sherry
cobblers
he
expressed
some
doubt
in
his
letter
whether
i
will
remember
him
as
if
i
didn
t
remember
making
six
sherry
cobblers
for
him
one
day
in
about
twenty
minutes
i
hope
you
left
him
well
two
years
having
elapsed
since
oh
yes
he
s
all
right
said
lord
lambeth
i
am
always
very
glad
to
see
your
countrymen
westgate
pursued
i
thought
it
would
be
time
some
of
you
should
be
coming
along
a
friend
of
mine
was
saying
to
me
only
a
day
or
two
ago
it
s
time
for
the
watermelons
and
the
the
englishmen
and
the
watermelons
just
now
are
about
the
same
thing
percy
beaumont
observed
wiping
his
dripping
forehead
ah
well
we
ll
put
you
on
ice
as
we
do
the
melons
you
must
go
down
to
we
ll
go
anywhere
said
lord
lambeth
yes
you
want
to
go
to
newport
that
s
what
you
want
to
do
westgate
affirmed
but
let
s
see
when
did
you
get
here
only
yesterday
said
percy
beaumont
ah
yes
by
the
russia
where
are
you
staying
at
the
hanover
i
think
they
call
pretty
comfortable
inquired
westgate
it
seems
a
capital
place
but
i
can
t
say
we
like
the
gnats
said
lord
lambeth
westgate
stared
and
laughed
oh
no
of
course
you
don
t
like
the
gnats
we
shall
expect
you
to
like
a
good
many
things
over
here
but
we
shan
t
insist
upon
your
liking
the
gnats
though
certainly
you
ll
admit
that
as
gnats
they
are
fine
eh
but
you
oughtn
t
to
remain
in
the
so
we
think
said
lord
lambeth
if
you
would
kindly
suggest
something
suggest
something
my
dear
sir
and
westgate
looked
at
him
narrowing
his
eyelids
open
your
mouth
and
shut
your
eyes
leave
it
to
me
and
i
ll
put
you
through
it
s
a
matter
of
national
pride
with
me
that
all
englishmen
should
have
a
good
time
and
as
i
have
had
considerable
practice
i
have
learned
to
minister
to
their
wants
i
find
they
generally
want
the
right
thing
so
just
please
to
consider
yourselves
my
property
and
if
anyone
should
try
to
appropriate
you
please
to
say
hands
off
too
late
for
the
but
let
s
see
continued
the
american
in
his
slow
humorous
voice
with
a
distinctness
of
utterance
which
appeared
to
his
visitors
to
be
part
of
a
humorous
intention
a
strangely
leisurely
speculative
voice
for
a
man
evidently
so
busy
and
as
they
felt
so
professional
let
s
see
are
you
going
to
make
something
of
a
stay
lord
lambeth
oh
dear
no
said
the
young
englishman
my
cousin
was
coming
over
on
some
business
so
i
just
came
across
at
an
hour
s
notice
for
the
is
it
your
first
visit
to
the
united
states
oh
dear
i
was
obliged
to
come
on
some
business
said
percy
beaumont
and
i
brought
lambeth
and
you
have
been
here
before
sir
never
i
thought
from
your
referring
to
business
said
westgate
oh
you
see
i
m
by
way
of
being
a
barrister
percy
beaumont
answered
i
know
some
people
that
think
of
bringing
a
suit
against
one
of
your
railways
and
they
asked
me
to
come
over
and
take
measures
what
s
your
railroad
he
asked
the
tennessee
the
american
tilted
back
his
chair
a
little
and
poised
it
an
instant
well
i
m
sorry
you
want
to
attack
one
of
our
institutions
he
said
smiling
but
i
guess
you
had
better
enjoy
yourself
first
i
m
certainly
rather
afraid
i
can
t
work
in
this
weather
the
young
barrister
confessed
leave
that
to
the
natives
said
westgate
leave
the
tennessee
central
to
me
beaumont
some
day
we
ll
talk
it
over
and
i
guess
i
can
make
it
square
but
i
didn
t
know
you
englishmen
ever
did
any
work
in
the
upper
oh
we
do
a
lot
of
work
don
t
we
lambeth
asked
percy
beaumont
i
must
certainly
be
at
home
by
the
of
september
said
the
younger
englishman
irrelevantly
but
gently
for
the
shooting
eh
or
is
it
the
hunting
or
the
fishing
inquired
his
entertainer
oh
i
must
be
in
scotland
said
lord
lambeth
blushing
a
little
well
then
rejoined
westgate
you
had
better
amuse
yourself
first
also
you
must
go
down
and
see
we
should
be
so
happy
if
you
would
kindly
tell
us
the
train
said
percy
beaumont
it
isn
t
a
train
it
s
a
oh
i
see
and
what
is
the
name
of
a
the
a
town
it
isn
t
a
town
said
westgate
laughing
it
s
a
well
what
shall
i
call
it
it
s
a
watering
place
in
short
it
s
newport
you
ll
see
what
it
is
it
s
cool
that
s
the
principal
thing
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
by
going
down
there
and
putting
yourself
into
the
hands
of
westgate
it
isn
t
perhaps
for
me
to
say
it
but
you
couldn
t
be
in
better
hands
also
in
those
of
her
sister
who
is
staying
with
her
she
is
very
fond
of
englishmen
she
thinks
there
is
nothing
like
mrs
westgate
or
a
her
sister
asked
percy
beaumont
modestly
yet
in
the
tone
of
an
inquiring
traveler
oh
i
mean
my
wife
said
westgate
i
don
t
suppose
my
knows
much
about
them
she
has
always
led
a
very
quiet
life
she
has
lived
in
percy
beaumont
listened
with
interest
that
i
believe
he
said
is
the
most
a
intellectual
town
i
believe
it
is
very
intellectual
i
don
t
go
there
much
responded
his
host
i
say
we
ought
to
go
there
said
lord
lambeth
to
his
companion
oh
lord
lambeth
wait
till
the
great
heat
is
over
westgate
interposed
boston
in
this
weather
would
be
very
trying
it
s
not
the
temperature
for
intellectual
exertion
at
boston
you
know
you
have
to
pass
an
examination
at
the
city
limits
and
when
you
come
away
they
give
you
a
kind
of
lord
lambeth
stared
blushing
a
little
and
percy
beaumont
stared
a
little
also
but
only
with
his
fine
natural
complexion
glancing
aside
after
a
moment
to
see
that
his
companion
was
not
looking
too
credulous
for
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
american
humor
i
daresay
it
is
very
jolly
said
the
younger
gentleman
i
daresay
it
is
said
westgate
only
i
must
impress
upon
you
that
at
present
tomorrow
morning
at
an
early
hour
you
will
be
expected
at
newport
we
have
a
house
there
half
the
people
in
new
york
go
there
for
the
summer
i
am
not
sure
that
at
this
very
moment
my
wife
can
take
you
in
she
has
got
a
lot
of
people
staying
with
her
i
don
t
know
who
they
all
are
only
she
may
have
no
room
but
you
can
begin
with
the
hotel
and
meanwhile
you
can
live
at
my
house
in
that
way
simply
sleeping
at
the
hotel
you
will
find
it
tolerable
for
the
rest
you
must
make
yourself
at
home
at
my
place
you
mustn
t
be
shy
you
know
if
you
are
only
here
for
a
month
that
will
be
a
great
waste
of
time
westgate
won
t
neglect
you
and
you
had
better
not
try
to
resist
her
i
know
something
about
that
i
expect
you
ll
find
some
pretty
girls
on
the
premises
i
shall
write
to
my
wife
by
this
afternoon
s
mail
and
tomorrow
morning
she
and
miss
alden
will
look
out
for
you
just
walk
right
in
and
make
yourself
comfortable
your
steamer
leaves
from
this
part
of
the
city
and
i
will
immediately
send
out
and
get
you
a
cabin
then
at
half
past
four
o
clock
just
call
for
me
here
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
put
you
on
board
it
s
a
big
boat
you
might
get
lost
a
few
days
hence
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
will
come
down
to
newport
and
see
how
you
are
getting
the
two
young
englishmen
inaugurated
the
policy
of
not
resisting
westgate
by
submitting
with
great
docility
and
thankfulness
to
her
husband
he
was
evidently
a
very
good
fellow
and
he
made
an
impression
upon
his
visitors
his
hospitality
seemed
to
recommend
itself
consciously
with
a
friendly
wink
as
it
were
as
if
it
hinted
judicially
that
you
could
not
possibly
make
a
better
bargain
lord
lambeth
and
his
cousin
left
their
entertainer
to
his
labors
and
returned
to
their
hotel
where
they
spent
three
or
four
hours
in
their
respective
shower
baths
percy
beaumont
had
suggested
that
they
ought
to
see
something
of
the
town
but
oh
damn
the
town
his
noble
kinsman
had
rejoined
they
returned
to
westgate
s
office
in
a
carriage
with
their
luggage
very
punctually
but
it
must
be
reluctantly
recorded
that
this
time
he
kept
them
waiting
so
long
that
they
felt
themselves
missing
the
steamer
and
were
deterred
only
by
an
amiable
modesty
from
dispensing
with
his
attendance
and
starting
on
a
hasty
scramble
to
the
wharf
but
when
at
last
he
appeared
and
the
carriage
plunged
into
the
purlieus
of
broadway
they
jolted
and
jostled
to
such
good
purpose
that
they
reached
the
huge
white
vessel
while
the
bell
for
departure
was
still
ringing
and
the
absorption
of
passengers
still
active
it
was
indeed
as
westgate
had
said
a
big
boat
and
his
leadership
in
the
innumerable
and
interminable
corridors
and
cabins
with
which
he
seemed
perfectly
acquainted
and
of
which
anyone
and
everyone
appeared
to
have
the
entree
was
very
grateful
to
the
slightly
bewildered
voyagers
he
showed
them
their
stateroom
a
spacious
apartment
embellished
with
gas
lamps
mirrors
en
pied
and
sculptured
furniture
and
then
long
after
they
had
been
intimately
convinced
that
the
steamer
was
in
motion
and
launched
upon
the
unknown
stream
that
they
were
about
to
navigate
he
bade
them
a
sociable
farewell
well
goodbye
lord
lambeth
he
said
goodbye
percy
beaumont
i
hope
you
ll
have
a
good
time
just
let
them
do
what
they
want
with
you
i
ll
come
down
and
look
after
the
young
englishmen
emerged
from
their
cabin
and
amused
themselves
with
wandering
about
the
immense
labyrinthine
steamer
which
struck
them
as
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
a
ship
and
a
hotel
it
was
densely
crowded
with
passengers
the
larger
number
of
whom
appeared
to
be
ladies
and
very
young
children
and
in
the
big
saloons
ornamented
in
white
and
gold
which
followed
each
other
in
surprising
succession
beneath
the
swinging
gaslight
and
among
the
small
side
passages
where
the
negro
domestics
of
both
sexes
assembled
with
an
air
of
philosophic
leisure
everyone
was
moving
to
and
fro
and
exchanging
loud
and
familiar
observations
eventually
at
the
instance
of
a
discriminating
black
our
young
men
went
and
had
some
supper
in
a
wonderful
place
arranged
like
a
theater
where
in
a
gilded
gallery
upon
which
little
boxes
appeared
to
open
a
large
orchestra
was
playing
operatic
selections
and
below
people
were
handing
about
bills
of
fare
as
if
they
had
been
programs
all
this
was
sufficiently
curious
but
the
agreeable
thing
later
was
to
sit
out
on
one
of
the
great
white
decks
of
the
steamer
in
the
warm
breezy
darkness
and
in
the
vague
starlight
to
make
out
the
line
of
low
mysterious
coast
the
young
englishmen
tried
american
cigars
those
of
westgate
and
talked
together
as
they
usually
talked
with
many
odd
silences
lapses
of
logic
and
incongruities
of
transition
like
people
who
have
grown
old
together
and
learned
to
supply
each
other
s
missing
phrases
or
more
especially
like
people
thoroughly
conscious
of
a
common
point
of
view
so
that
a
style
of
conversation
superficially
lacking
in
finish
might
suffice
for
reference
to
a
fund
of
associations
in
the
light
of
which
everything
was
all
right
we
really
seem
to
be
going
out
to
sea
percy
beaumont
observed
upon
my
word
we
are
going
back
to
england
he
has
shipped
us
off
again
i
call
that
real
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
said
lord
lambeth
i
want
to
see
those
pretty
girls
at
newport
you
know
he
told
us
the
place
was
an
island
and
aren
t
all
islands
in
the
sea
well
resumed
the
elder
traveler
after
a
while
if
his
house
is
as
good
as
his
cigars
we
shall
do
very
he
seems
a
very
good
fellow
said
lord
lambeth
as
if
this
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
i
say
we
had
better
remain
at
the
inn
rejoined
his
companion
presently
i
don
t
think
i
like
the
way
he
spoke
of
his
house
i
don
t
like
stopping
in
the
house
with
such
a
tremendous
lot
of
oh
i
don
t
mind
said
lord
lambeth
and
then
they
smoked
a
while
in
silence
fancy
his
thinking
we
do
no
work
in
england
the
young
man
resumed
i
daresay
he
didn
t
really
think
so
said
percy
beaumont
well
i
guess
they
don
t
know
much
about
england
over
here
declared
lord
lambeth
humorously
and
then
there
was
another
long
pause
he
was
devilish
civil
observed
the
young
nobleman
nothing
certainly
could
have
been
more
civil
rejoined
his
companion
littledale
said
his
wife
was
great
fun
said
lord
lambeth
whose
wife
littledale
s
this
american
s
westgate
what
s
his
name
beaumont
was
silent
a
moment
what
was
fun
to
littledale
he
said
at
last
rather
sententiously
may
be
death
to
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
his
kinsman
i
am
as
good
a
man
as
my
dear
boy
i
hope
you
won
t
begin
to
flirt
said
percy
beaumont
i
don
t
care
i
daresay
i
shan
t
with
a
married
woman
if
she
s
bent
upon
it
it
s
all
very
well
beaumont
expounded
but
our
friend
mentioned
a
young
lady
a
sister
a
for
god
s
sake
don
t
get
entangled
with
her
how
do
you
mean
entangled
depend
upon
it
she
will
try
to
hook
oh
bother
said
lord
lambeth
american
girls
are
very
clever
urged
his
companion
so
much
the
better
the
young
man
declared
i
fancy
they
are
always
up
to
some
game
of
that
sort
beaumont
continued
they
can
t
be
worse
than
they
are
in
england
said
lord
lambeth
judicially
ah
but
in
england
replied
beaumont
you
have
got
your
natural
protectors
you
have
got
your
mother
and
my
mother
and
sisters
began
the
young
nobleman
with
a
certain
energy
but
he
stopped
in
time
puffing
at
his
cigar
your
mother
spoke
to
me
about
it
with
tears
in
her
eyes
said
percy
beaumont
she
said
she
felt
very
nervous
i
promised
to
keep
you
out
of
you
had
better
take
care
of
yourself
said
the
object
of
maternal
and
ducal
solicitude
ah
rejoined
the
young
barrister
i
haven
t
the
expectation
of
a
hundred
thousand
a
year
not
to
mention
other
well
said
lord
lambeth
don
t
cry
out
before
you
re
hurt
it
was
certainly
very
much
cooler
at
newport
where
our
travelers
found
themselves
assigned
to
a
couple
of
diminutive
bedrooms
in
a
faraway
angle
of
an
immense
hotel
they
had
gone
ashore
in
the
early
summer
twilight
and
had
very
promptly
put
themselves
to
bed
thanks
to
which
circumstance
and
to
their
having
during
the
previous
hours
in
their
commodious
cabin
slept
the
sleep
of
youth
and
health
they
began
to
feel
toward
eleven
o
clock
very
alert
and
inquisitive
they
looked
out
of
their
windows
across
a
row
of
small
green
fields
bordered
with
low
stone
walls
of
rude
construction
and
saw
a
deep
blue
ocean
lying
beneath
a
deep
blue
sky
and
flecked
now
and
then
with
scintillating
patches
of
foam
a
strong
fresh
breeze
came
in
through
the
curtainless
casements
and
prompted
our
young
men
to
observe
generally
that
it
didn
t
seem
half
a
bad
climate
they
made
other
observations
after
they
had
emerged
from
their
rooms
in
pursuit
of
breakfast
a
meal
of
which
they
partook
in
a
huge
bare
hall
where
a
hundred
negroes
in
white
jackets
were
shuffling
about
upon
an
uncarpeted
floor
where
the
flies
were
superabundant
and
the
tables
and
dishes
covered
over
with
a
strange
voluminous
integument
of
coarse
blue
gauze
and
where
several
little
boys
and
girls
who
had
risen
late
were
seated
in
fastidious
solitude
at
the
morning
repast
these
young
persons
had
not
the
morning
paper
before
them
but
they
were
engaged
in
languid
perusal
of
the
bill
of
fare
this
latter
document
was
a
great
puzzle
to
our
friends
who
on
reflecting
that
its
bewildering
categories
had
relation
to
breakfast
alone
had
an
uneasy
prevision
of
an
encyclopedic
dinner
list
they
found
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
at
the
hotel
an
enormous
wooden
structure
for
the
erection
of
which
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
virgin
forests
of
the
west
must
have
been
terribly
deflowered
it
was
perforated
from
end
to
end
with
immense
bare
corridors
through
which
a
strong
draught
was
blowing
bearing
along
wonderful
figures
of
ladies
in
white
morning
dresses
and
clouds
of
valenciennes
lace
who
seemed
to
float
down
the
long
vistas
with
expanded
furbelows
like
angels
spreading
their
wings
in
front
was
a
gigantic
veranda
upon
which
an
army
might
have
encamped
a
vast
wooden
terrace
with
a
roof
as
lofty
as
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
here
our
young
englishmen
enjoyed
as
they
supposed
a
glimpse
of
american
society
which
was
distributed
over
the
measureless
expanse
in
a
variety
of
sedentary
attitudes
and
appeared
to
consist
largely
of
pretty
young
girls
dressed
as
if
for
a
fete
champetre
swaying
to
and
fro
in
rocking
chairs
fanning
themselves
with
large
straw
fans
and
enjoying
an
enviable
exemption
from
social
cares
lord
lambeth
had
a
theory
which
it
might
be
interesting
to
trace
to
its
origin
that
it
would
be
not
only
agreeable
but
easily
possible
to
enter
into
relations
with
one
of
these
young
ladies
and
his
companion
as
he
had
done
a
couple
of
days
before
found
occasion
to
check
the
young
nobleman
s
colloquial
impulses
you
had
better
take
care
said
percy
beaumont
or
you
will
have
an
offended
father
or
brother
pulling
out
a
bowie
i
assure
you
it
is
all
right
lord
lambeth
replied
you
know
the
americans
come
to
these
big
hotels
to
make
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
neither
do
you
said
his
kinsman
who
like
a
clever
man
had
begun
to
perceive
that
the
observation
of
american
society
demanded
a
readjustment
of
one
s
standard
hang
it
then
let
s
find
out
cried
lord
lambeth
with
some
impatience
you
know
i
don
t
want
to
miss
we
will
find
out
said
percy
beaumont
very
reasonably
we
will
go
and
see
westgate
and
make
all
proper
and
so
the
two
inquiring
englishmen
who
had
this
lady
s
address
inscribed
in
her
husband
s
hand
upon
a
card
descended
from
the
veranda
of
the
big
hotel
and
took
their
way
according
to
direction
along
a
large
straight
road
past
a
series
of
villas
embosomed
in
shrubs
and
flowers
and
enclosed
in
an
ingenious
variety
of
wooden
palings
the
morning
was
brilliant
and
cool
the
villas
were
smart
and
snug
and
the
walk
of
the
young
travelers
was
very
entertaining
everything
looked
as
if
it
had
received
a
coat
of
fresh
paint
the
day
before
the
red
roofs
the
green
shutters
the
clean
bright
browns
and
buffs
of
the
housefronts
the
flower
beds
on
the
little
lawns
seemed
to
sparkle
in
the
radiant
air
and
the
gravel
in
the
short
carriage
sweeps
to
flash
and
twinkle
along
the
road
came
a
hundred
little
basket
phaetons
in
which
almost
always
a
couple
of
ladies
were
sitting
ladies
in
white
dresses
and
long
white
gloves
holding
the
reins
and
looking
at
the
two
englishmen
whose
nationality
was
not
elusive
through
thick
blue
veils
tied
tightly
about
their
faces
as
if
to
guard
their
complexions
at
last
the
young
men
came
within
sight
of
the
sea
again
and
then
having
interrogated
a
gardener
over
the
paling
of
a
villa
they
turned
into
an
open
gate
here
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
ocean
and
with
a
very
picturesque
structure
resembling
a
magnified
chalet
which
was
perched
upon
a
green
embankment
just
above
it
the
house
had
a
veranda
of
extraordinary
width
all
around
it
and
a
great
many
doors
and
windows
standing
open
to
the
veranda
these
various
apertures
had
in
common
such
an
accessible
hospitable
air
such
a
breezy
flutter
within
of
light
curtains
such
expansive
thresholds
and
reassuring
interiors
that
our
friends
hardly
knew
which
was
the
regular
entrance
and
after
hesitating
a
moment
presented
themselves
at
one
of
the
windows
the
room
within
was
dark
but
in
a
moment
a
graceful
figure
vaguely
shaped
itself
in
the
gloom
and
a
lady
came
to
meet
them
then
they
saw
that
she
had
been
seated
at
a
table
writing
and
that
she
had
heard
them
and
had
got
up
she
stepped
out
into
the
light
she
wore
a
frank
charming
smile
with
which
she
held
out
her
hand
to
percy
beaumont
oh
you
must
be
lord
lambeth
and
beaumont
she
said
i
have
heard
from
my
husband
that
you
would
come
i
am
extremely
glad
to
see
and
she
shook
hands
with
each
of
her
visitors
her
visitors
were
a
little
shy
but
they
had
very
good
manners
they
responded
with
smiles
and
exclamations
and
they
apologized
for
not
knowing
the
front
door
the
lady
rejoined
with
vivacity
that
when
she
wanted
to
see
people
very
much
she
did
not
insist
upon
those
distinctions
and
that
westgate
had
written
to
her
of
his
english
friends
in
terms
that
made
her
really
anxious
he
said
you
were
so
terribly
prostrated
said
westgate
oh
you
mean
by
the
heat
replied
percy
beaumont
we
were
rather
knocked
up
but
we
feel
wonderfully
better
we
had
such
a
jolly
a
voyage
down
here
it
s
so
very
good
of
you
to
yes
it
s
so
very
kind
of
you
murmured
lord
lambeth
westgate
stood
smiling
she
was
extremely
pretty
well
i
did
mind
she
said
and
i
thought
of
sending
for
you
this
morning
to
the
ocean
house
i
am
very
glad
you
are
better
and
i
am
charmed
you
have
arrived
you
must
come
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
and
she
led
the
way
with
a
light
smooth
step
looking
back
at
the
young
men
and
smiling
the
other
side
of
the
piazza
was
as
lord
lambeth
presently
remarked
a
very
jolly
place
it
was
of
the
most
liberal
proportions
and
with
its
awnings
its
fanciful
chairs
its
cushions
and
rugs
its
view
of
the
ocean
close
at
hand
tumbling
along
the
base
of
the
low
cliffs
whose
level
tops
intervened
in
lawnlike
smoothness
it
formed
a
charming
complement
to
the
drawing
room
as
such
it
was
in
course
of
use
at
the
present
moment
it
was
occupied
by
a
social
circle
there
were
several
ladies
and
two
or
three
gentlemen
to
whom
westgate
proceeded
to
introduce
the
distinguished
strangers
she
mentioned
a
great
many
names
very
freely
and
distinctly
the
young
englishmen
shuffling
about
and
bowing
were
rather
bewildered
but
at
last
they
were
provided
with
chairs
low
wicker
chairs
gilded
and
tied
with
a
great
many
ribbons
and
one
of
the
ladies
a
very
young
person
with
a
little
snub
nose
and
several
dimples
offered
percy
beaumont
a
fan
the
fan
was
also
adorned
with
pink
love
knots
but
percy
beaumont
declined
it
although
he
was
very
hot
presently
however
it
became
cooler
the
breeze
from
the
sea
was
delicious
the
view
was
charming
and
the
people
sitting
there
looked
exceedingly
fresh
and
comfortable
several
of
the
ladies
seemed
to
be
young
girls
and
the
gentlemen
were
slim
fair
youths
such
as
our
friends
had
seen
the
day
before
in
new
york
the
ladies
were
working
upon
bands
of
tapestry
and
one
of
the
young
men
had
an
open
book
in
his
lap
beaumont
afterward
learned
from
one
of
the
ladies
that
this
young
man
had
been
reading
aloud
that
he
was
from
boston
and
was
very
fond
of
reading
aloud
beaumont
said
it
was
a
great
pity
that
they
had
interrupted
him
he
should
like
so
much
from
all
he
had
heard
to
hear
a
bostonian
read
couldn
t
the
young
man
be
induced
to
go
on
oh
no
said
his
informant
very
freely
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
get
the
young
ladies
to
attend
to
him
there
was
something
very
friendly
beaumont
perceived
in
the
attitude
of
the
company
they
looked
at
the
young
englishmen
with
an
air
of
animated
sympathy
and
interest
they
smiled
brightly
and
unanimously
at
everything
either
of
the
visitors
said
lord
lambeth
and
his
companion
felt
that
they
were
being
made
very
welcome
westgate
seated
herself
between
them
and
talking
a
great
deal
to
each
they
had
occasion
to
observe
that
she
was
as
pretty
as
their
friend
littledale
had
promised
she
was
thirty
years
old
with
the
eyes
and
the
smile
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
she
was
extremely
light
and
graceful
elegant
exquisite
westgate
was
extremely
spontaneous
she
was
very
frank
and
demonstrative
and
appeared
always
while
she
looked
at
you
delightedly
with
her
beautiful
young
eyes
to
be
making
sudden
confessions
and
concessions
after
momentary
hesitations
we
shall
expect
to
see
a
great
deal
of
you
she
said
to
lord
lambeth
with
a
kind
of
joyous
earnestness
we
are
very
fond
of
englishmen
here
that
is
there
are
a
great
many
we
have
been
fond
of
after
a
day
or
two
you
must
come
and
stay
with
us
we
hope
you
will
stay
a
long
time
newport
s
a
very
nice
place
when
you
come
really
to
know
it
when
you
know
plenty
of
people
of
course
you
and
beaumont
will
have
no
difficulty
about
that
englishmen
are
very
well
received
here
there
are
almost
always
two
or
three
of
them
about
i
think
they
always
like
it
and
i
must
say
i
should
think
they
would
they
receive
ever
so
much
attention
i
must
say
i
think
they
sometimes
get
spoiled
but
i
am
sure
you
and
beaumont
are
proof
against
that
my
husband
tells
me
you
are
a
friend
of
captain
littledale
he
was
such
a
charming
man
he
made
himself
most
agreeable
here
and
i
am
sure
i
wonder
he
didn
t
stay
it
couldn
t
have
been
pleasanter
for
him
in
his
own
country
though
i
suppose
it
is
very
pleasant
in
england
for
english
people
i
don
t
know
myself
i
have
been
there
very
little
i
have
been
a
great
deal
abroad
but
i
am
always
on
the
continent
i
must
say
i
m
extremely
fond
of
paris
you
know
we
americans
always
are
we
go
there
when
we
die
did
you
ever
hear
that
before
that
was
said
by
a
great
wit
i
mean
the
good
americans
but
we
are
all
good
you
ll
see
that
for
yourself
all
i
know
of
england
is
london
and
all
i
know
of
london
is
that
place
on
that
little
corner
you
know
where
you
buy
jackets
jackets
with
that
coarse
braid
and
those
big
buttons
they
make
very
good
jackets
in
london
i
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
that
and
some
people
like
the
hats
but
about
the
hats
i
was
always
a
heretic
i
always
got
my
hats
in
paris
you
can
t
wear
an
english
hat
at
least
i
never
could
unless
you
dress
your
hair
a
l
anglaise
and
i
must
say
that
is
a
talent
i
have
never
possessed
in
paris
they
will
make
things
to
suit
your
peculiarities
but
in
england
i
think
you
like
much
more
to
have
how
shall
i
say
it
one
thing
for
everybody
i
mean
as
regards
dress
i
don
t
know
about
other
things
but
i
have
always
supposed
that
in
other
things
everything
was
different
i
mean
according
to
the
people
according
to
the
classes
and
all
that
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
that
i
don
t
take
a
very
favorable
view
but
you
know
you
can
t
take
a
very
favorable
view
in
dover
street
in
the
month
of
november
that
has
always
been
my
fate
do
you
know
jones
s
hotel
in
dover
street
that
s
all
i
know
of
england
of
course
everyone
admits
that
the
english
hotels
are
your
weak
point
there
was
always
the
most
frightful
fog
i
couldn
t
see
to
try
my
things
on
when
i
got
over
to
america
into
the
light
i
usually
found
they
were
twice
too
big
the
next
time
i
mean
to
go
in
the
season
i
think
i
shall
go
next
year
i
want
very
much
to
take
my
sister
she
has
never
been
to
england
i
don
t
know
whether
you
know
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
the
englishmen
who
come
here
sometimes
get
spoiled
i
mean
that
they
take
things
as
a
matter
of
course
things
that
are
done
for
them
now
naturally
they
are
only
a
matter
of
course
when
the
englishmen
are
very
nice
but
of
course
they
are
almost
always
very
nice
of
course
this
isn
t
nearly
such
an
interesting
country
as
england
there
are
not
nearly
so
many
things
to
see
and
we
haven
t
your
country
life
i
have
never
seen
anything
of
your
country
life
when
i
am
in
europe
i
am
always
on
the
continent
but
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
it
i
know
that
when
you
are
among
yourselves
in
the
country
you
have
the
most
beautiful
time
of
course
we
have
nothing
of
that
sort
we
have
nothing
on
that
scale
i
don
t
apologize
lord
lambeth
some
americans
are
always
apologizing
you
must
have
noticed
that
we
have
the
reputation
of
always
boasting
and
bragging
and
waving
the
american
flag
but
i
must
say
that
what
strikes
me
is
that
we
are
perpetually
making
excuses
and
trying
to
smooth
things
over
the
american
flag
has
quite
gone
out
of
fashion
it
s
very
carefully
folded
up
like
an
old
tablecloth
why
should
we
apologize
the
english
never
apologize
do
they
no
i
must
say
i
never
apologize
you
must
take
us
as
we
come
with
all
our
imperfections
on
our
heads
of
course
we
haven
t
your
country
life
and
your
old
ruins
and
your
great
estates
and
your
leisure
class
and
all
that
but
if
we
haven
t
i
should
think
you
might
find
it
a
pleasant
change
i
think
any
country
is
pleasant
where
they
have
pleasant
manners
captain
littledale
told
me
he
had
never
seen
such
pleasant
manners
as
at
newport
and
he
had
been
a
great
deal
in
european
society
hadn
t
he
been
in
the
diplomatic
service
he
told
me
the
dream
of
his
life
was
to
get
appointed
to
a
diplomatic
post
in
washington
but
he
doesn
t
seem
to
have
succeeded
i
suppose
that
in
england
promotion
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
fearfully
slow
with
us
you
know
it
s
a
great
deal
too
fast
you
see
i
admit
our
drawbacks
but
i
must
confess
i
think
newport
is
an
ideal
place
i
don
t
know
anything
like
it
anywhere
captain
littledale
told
me
he
didn
t
know
anything
like
it
anywhere
it
s
entirely
different
from
most
watering
places
it
s
a
most
charming
life
i
must
say
i
think
that
when
one
goes
to
a
foreign
country
one
ought
to
enjoy
the
differences
of
course
there
are
differences
otherwise
what
did
one
come
abroad
for
look
for
your
pleasure
in
the
differences
lord
lambeth
that
s
the
way
to
do
it
and
then
i
am
sure
you
will
find
american
society
at
least
newport
society
most
charming
and
most
interesting
i
wish
very
much
my
husband
were
here
but
he
s
dreadfully
confined
to
new
york
i
suppose
you
think
that
is
very
strange
for
a
gentleman
but
you
see
we
haven
t
any
leisure
westgate
s
discourse
delivered
in
a
soft
sweet
voice
flowed
on
like
a
miniature
torrent
and
was
interrupted
by
a
hundred
little
smiles
glances
and
gestures
which
might
have
figured
the
irregularities
and
obstructions
of
such
a
stream
lord
lambeth
listened
to
her
with
it
must
be
confessed
a
rather
ineffectual
attention
although
he
indulged
in
a
good
many
little
murmurs
and
ejaculations
of
assent
and
deprecation
he
had
no
great
faculty
for
apprehending
generalizations
there
were
some
three
or
four
indeed
which
in
the
play
of
his
own
intelligence
he
had
originated
and
which
had
seemed
convenient
at
the
moment
but
at
the
present
time
he
could
hardly
have
been
said
to
follow
westgate
as
she
darted
gracefully
about
in
the
sea
of
speculation
fortunately
she
asked
for
no
especial
rejoinder
for
she
looked
about
at
the
rest
of
the
company
as
well
and
smiled
at
percy
beaumont
on
the
other
side
of
her
as
if
he
too
much
understand
her
and
agree
with
her
he
was
rather
more
successful
than
his
companion
for
besides
being
as
we
know
cleverer
his
attention
was
not
vaguely
distracted
by
close
vicinity
to
a
remarkably
interesting
young
girl
with
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
this
was
the
case
with
lord
lambeth
to
whom
it
occurred
after
a
while
that
the
young
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
was
the
pretty
sister
of
whom
westgate
had
spoken
she
presently
turned
to
him
with
a
remark
which
established
her
identity
it
s
a
great
pity
you
couldn
t
have
brought
my
with
you
it
s
a
great
shame
he
should
be
in
new
york
in
these
oh
yes
it
s
so
very
hot
said
lord
lambeth
it
must
be
dreadful
said
the
young
girl
i
daresay
he
is
very
busy
lord
lambeth
observed
the
gentlemen
in
america
work
too
much
the
young
girl
went
on
oh
do
they
i
daresay
they
like
it
said
her
interlocutor
i
don
t
like
it
one
never
sees
don
t
you
really
asked
lord
lambeth
i
shouldn
t
have
fancied
have
you
come
to
study
american
manners
asked
the
young
girl
oh
i
don
t
know
i
just
came
over
for
a
lark
i
haven
t
got
here
there
was
a
pause
and
lord
lambeth
began
again
but
westgate
will
come
down
here
will
not
he
i
certainly
hope
he
will
he
must
help
to
entertain
you
and
lord
lambeth
looked
at
her
a
little
with
his
handsome
brown
eyes
do
you
suppose
he
would
have
come
down
with
us
if
we
had
urged
him
westgate
s
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
i
daresay
he
would
she
answered
really
said
the
young
englishman
he
was
immensely
civil
to
beaumont
and
me
he
added
he
is
a
dear
good
fellow
the
young
lady
rejoined
and
he
is
a
perfect
husband
but
all
americans
are
that
she
continued
smiling
really
lord
lambeth
exclaimed
again
and
wondered
whether
all
american
ladies
had
such
a
passion
for
generalizing
as
these
two
he
sat
there
a
good
while
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
it
was
all
very
friendly
and
lively
and
jolly
everyone
present
sooner
or
later
said
something
to
him
and
seemed
to
make
a
particular
point
of
addressing
him
by
name
two
or
three
other
persons
came
in
and
there
was
a
shifting
of
seats
and
changing
of
places
the
gentlemen
all
entered
into
intimate
conversation
with
the
two
englishmen
made
them
urgent
offers
of
hospitality
and
hoped
they
might
frequently
be
of
service
to
them
they
were
afraid
lord
lambeth
and
beaumont
were
not
very
comfortable
at
their
hotel
that
it
was
not
as
one
of
them
said
so
private
as
those
dear
little
english
inns
of
this
last
gentleman
went
on
to
say
that
unfortunately
as
yet
perhaps
privacy
was
not
quite
so
easily
obtained
in
america
as
might
be
desired
still
he
continued
you
could
generally
get
it
by
paying
for
it
in
fact
you
could
get
everything
in
america
nowadays
by
paying
for
it
american
life
was
certainly
growing
a
great
deal
more
private
it
was
growing
very
much
like
england
everything
at
newport
for
instance
was
thoroughly
private
lord
lambeth
would
probably
be
struck
with
that
it
was
also
represented
to
the
strangers
that
it
mattered
very
little
whether
their
hotel
was
agreeable
as
everyone
would
want
them
to
make
visits
they
would
stay
with
other
people
and
in
any
case
they
would
be
a
great
deal
at
westgate
s
they
would
find
that
very
charming
it
was
the
pleasantest
house
in
newport
it
was
a
pity
westgate
was
always
away
he
was
a
man
of
the
highest
ability
very
acute
very
acute
he
worked
like
a
horse
and
he
left
his
wife
well
to
do
about
as
she
liked
he
liked
her
to
enjoy
herself
and
she
seemed
to
know
how
she
was
extremely
brilliant
and
a
splendid
talker
some
people
preferred
her
sister
but
miss
alden
was
very
different
she
was
in
a
different
style
altogether
some
people
even
thought
her
prettier
and
certainly
she
was
not
so
sharp
she
was
more
in
the
boston
style
she
had
lived
a
great
deal
in
boston
and
she
was
very
highly
educated
boston
girls
it
was
propounded
were
more
like
english
young
ladies
lord
lambeth
had
presently
a
chance
to
test
the
truth
of
this
proposition
for
on
the
company
rising
in
compliance
with
a
suggestion
from
their
hostess
that
they
should
walk
down
to
the
rocks
and
look
at
the
sea
the
young
englishman
again
found
himself
as
they
strolled
across
the
grass
in
proximity
to
westgate
s
sister
though
she
was
but
a
girl
of
twenty
she
appeared
to
feel
the
obligation
to
exert
an
active
hospitality
and
this
was
perhaps
the
more
to
be
noticed
as
she
seemed
by
nature
a
reserved
and
retiring
person
and
had
little
of
her
sister
s
fraternizing
quality
she
was
perhaps
rather
too
thin
and
she
was
a
little
pale
but
as
she
moved
slowly
over
the
grass
with
her
arms
hanging
at
her
sides
looking
gravely
for
a
moment
at
the
sea
and
then
brightly
for
all
her
gravity
at
him
lord
lambeth
thought
her
at
least
as
pretty
as
westgate
and
reflected
that
if
this
was
the
boston
style
the
boston
style
was
very
charming
he
thought
she
looked
very
clever
he
could
imagine
that
she
was
highly
educated
but
at
the
same
time
she
seemed
gentle
and
graceful
for
all
her
cleverness
however
he
felt
that
she
had
to
think
a
little
what
to
say
she
didn
t
say
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
he
had
come
from
a
different
part
of
the
world
and
from
a
different
society
and
she
was
trying
to
adapt
her
conversation
the
others
were
scattering
themselves
near
the
rocks
westgate
had
charge
of
percy
beaumont
very
jolly
place
isn
t
it
said
lord
lambeth
it
s
a
very
jolly
place
to
very
charming
said
the
young
girl
i
often
sit
here
there
are
all
kinds
of
cozy
corners
as
if
they
had
been
made
on
ah
i
suppose
you
have
had
some
of
them
made
said
the
young
man
miss
alden
looked
at
him
a
moment
oh
no
we
have
had
nothing
made
it
s
pure
i
should
think
you
would
have
a
few
little
benches
rustic
seats
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
might
be
so
jolly
to
sit
here
you
know
lord
lambeth
went
on
i
am
afraid
we
haven
t
so
many
of
those
things
as
you
said
the
young
girl
thoughtfully
i
daresay
you
go
in
for
pure
nature
as
you
were
saying
nature
over
here
must
be
so
grand
you
and
lord
lambeth
looked
about
him
the
little
coast
line
hereabouts
was
very
pretty
but
it
was
not
at
all
grand
and
miss
alden
appeared
to
rise
to
a
perception
of
this
fact
i
am
afraid
it
seems
to
you
very
rough
she
said
it
s
not
like
the
coast
scenery
in
kingsley
s
ah
the
novels
always
overdo
it
you
know
lord
lambeth
rejoined
you
must
not
go
by
the
they
were
wandering
about
a
little
on
the
rocks
and
they
stopped
and
looked
down
into
a
narrow
chasm
where
the
rising
tide
made
a
curious
bellowing
sound
it
was
loud
enough
to
prevent
their
hearing
each
other
and
they
stood
there
for
some
moments
in
silence
the
young
girl
looked
at
her
companion
observing
him
attentively
but
covertly
as
women
even
when
very
young
know
how
to
do
lord
lambeth
repaid
observation
tall
straight
and
strong
he
was
handsome
as
certain
young
englishmen
and
certain
young
englishmen
almost
alone
are
handsome
with
a
perfect
finish
of
feature
and
a
look
of
intellectual
repose
and
gentle
good
temper
which
seemed
somehow
to
be
consequent
upon
his
nose
and
chin
and
to
speak
of
lord
lambeth
s
expression
of
intellectual
repose
is
not
simply
a
civil
way
of
saying
that
he
looked
stupid
he
was
evidently
not
a
young
man
of
an
irritable
imagination
he
was
not
as
he
would
himself
have
said
tremendously
clever
but
though
there
was
a
kind
of
appealing
dullness
in
his
eye
he
looked
thoroughly
reasonable
and
competent
and
his
appearance
proclaimed
that
to
be
a
nobleman
an
athlete
and
an
excellent
fellow
was
a
sufficiently
brilliant
combination
of
qualities
the
young
girl
beside
him
it
may
be
attested
without
further
delay
thought
him
the
handsomest
young
man
she
had
ever
seen
and
bessie
alden
s
imagination
unlike
that
of
her
companion
was
irritable
he
however
was
also
making
up
his
mind
that
she
was
uncommonly
pretty
i
daresay
it
s
very
gay
here
that
you
have
lots
of
balls
and
parties
he
said
for
if
he
was
not
tremendously
clever
he
rather
prided
himself
on
having
with
women
a
sufficiency
of
conversation
oh
yes
there
is
a
great
deal
going
on
bessie
alden
replied
there
are
not
so
many
balls
but
there
are
a
good
many
other
things
you
will
see
for
yourself
we
live
rather
in
the
midst
of
it
s
very
kind
of
you
to
say
that
but
i
thought
you
americans
were
always
i
suppose
we
dance
a
good
deal
but
i
have
never
seen
much
of
it
we
don
t
do
it
much
at
any
rate
in
summer
and
i
am
sure
said
bessie
alden
that
we
don
t
have
so
many
balls
as
you
have
in
really
exclaimed
lord
lambeth
ah
in
england
it
all
depends
you
you
will
not
think
much
of
our
gaieties
said
the
young
girl
looking
at
him
with
a
little
mixture
of
interrogation
and
decision
which
was
peculiar
to
her
the
interrogation
seemed
earnest
and
the
decision
seemed
arch
but
the
mixture
at
any
rate
was
charming
those
things
with
us
are
much
less
splendid
than
in
i
fancy
you
don
t
mean
that
said
lord
lambeth
laughing
i
assure
you
i
mean
everything
i
say
the
young
girl
declared
certainly
from
what
i
have
read
about
english
society
it
is
very
ah
well
you
know
said
her
companion
those
things
are
often
described
by
fellows
who
know
nothing
about
them
you
mustn
t
mind
what
you
oh
i
shall
mind
what
i
read
bessie
alden
rejoined
when
i
read
thackeray
and
george
eliot
how
can
i
help
minding
them
ah
well
thackeray
and
george
eliot
said
the
young
nobleman
i
haven
t
read
much
of
don
t
you
suppose
they
know
about
society
asked
bessie
alden
oh
i
daresay
they
know
they
were
so
very
clever
but
these
fashionable
novels
said
lord
lambeth
they
are
awful
rot
you
his
companion
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
her
dark
blue
eyes
and
then
she
looked
down
in
the
chasm
where
the
water
was
tumbling
about
do
you
mean
gore
for
instance
she
said
presently
raising
her
eyes
i
am
afraid
i
haven
t
read
that
either
was
the
young
man
s
rejoinder
laughing
a
little
and
blushing
i
am
afraid
you
ll
think
i
am
not
very
reading
gore
is
no
proof
of
intellect
but
i
like
reading
everything
about
english
life
even
poor
books
i
am
so
curious
about
aren
t
ladies
always
curious
asked
the
young
man
jestingly
but
bessie
alden
appeared
to
desire
to
answer
his
question
seriously
i
don
t
think
so
i
don
t
think
we
are
enough
so
that
we
care
about
many
things
so
it
s
all
the
more
of
a
compliment
she
added
that
i
should
want
to
know
so
much
about
the
logic
here
seemed
a
little
close
but
lord
lambeth
made
conscious
of
a
compliment
found
his
natural
modesty
just
at
hand
i
am
sure
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
i
really
think
i
know
a
great
deal
for
a
person
who
has
never
been
have
you
really
never
been
there
cried
lord
lambeth
fancy
never
except
in
imagination
said
the
young
girl
fancy
repeated
her
companion
but
i
daresay
you
ll
go
soon
won
t
you
it
s
the
dream
of
my
life
declared
bessie
alden
smiling
but
your
sister
seems
to
know
a
tremendous
lot
about
london
lord
lambeth
went
on
the
young
girl
was
silent
a
moment
my
sister
and
i
are
two
very
different
persons
she
presently
said
she
has
been
a
great
deal
in
europe
she
has
been
in
england
several
times
she
has
known
a
great
many
english
but
you
must
have
known
some
too
said
lord
lambeth
i
don
t
think
that
i
have
ever
spoken
to
one
before
you
are
the
first
englishman
that
to
my
knowledge
i
have
ever
talked
bessie
alden
made
this
statement
with
a
certain
gravity
almost
as
it
seemed
to
lord
lambeth
an
impressiveness
attempts
at
impressiveness
always
made
him
feel
awkward
and
he
now
began
to
laugh
and
swing
his
stick
ah
you
would
have
been
sure
to
know
he
said
and
then
he
added
after
an
instant
i
m
sorry
i
am
not
a
better
the
young
girl
looked
away
but
she
smiled
laying
aside
her
impressiveness
you
must
remember
that
you
are
only
a
beginning
she
said
then
she
retraced
her
steps
leading
the
way
back
to
the
lawn
where
they
saw
westgate
come
toward
them
with
percy
beaumont
still
at
her
side
perhaps
i
shall
go
to
england
next
year
miss
alden
continued
i
want
to
immensely
my
sister
is
going
to
europe
and
she
has
asked
me
to
go
with
her
if
we
go
i
shall
make
her
stay
as
long
as
possible
in
ah
you
must
come
in
july
said
lord
lambeth
that
s
the
time
when
there
is
most
going
i
don
t
think
i
can
wait
till
july
the
young
girl
rejoined
by
the
first
of
may
i
shall
be
very
they
had
gone
further
and
westgate
and
her
companion
were
near
them
kitty
said
miss
alden
i
have
given
out
that
we
are
going
to
london
next
may
so
please
to
conduct
yourself
percy
beaumont
wore
a
somewhat
animated
even
a
slightly
irritated
air
he
was
by
no
means
so
handsome
a
man
as
his
cousin
although
in
his
cousin
s
absence
he
might
have
passed
for
a
striking
specimen
of
the
tall
muscular
englishman
just
now
beaumont
s
clear
eyes
which
were
small
and
of
a
pale
gray
color
had
a
rather
troubled
light
and
after
glancing
at
bessie
alden
while
she
spoke
he
rested
them
upon
his
kinsman
westgate
meanwhile
with
her
superfluously
pretty
gaze
looked
at
everyone
alike
you
had
better
wait
till
the
time
comes
she
said
to
her
sister
perhaps
next
may
you
won
t
care
so
much
about
london
beaumont
and
i
she
went
on
smiling
at
her
companion
have
had
a
tremendous
discussion
we
don
t
agree
about
anything
it
s
perfectly
oh
i
say
percy
exclaimed
lord
lambeth
i
disagree
said
beaumont
stroking
down
his
back
hair
even
to
the
point
of
not
thinking
it
oh
i
say
cried
lord
lambeth
again
i
don
t
see
anything
delightful
in
my
disagreeing
with
westgate
said
percy
beaumont
well
i
do
westgate
declared
and
she
turned
to
her
sister
you
know
you
have
to
go
to
town
the
phaeton
is
there
you
had
better
take
lord
at
this
point
percy
beaumont
certainly
looked
straight
at
his
kinsman
he
tried
to
catch
his
eye
but
lord
lambeth
would
not
look
at
him
his
own
eyes
were
better
occupied
i
shall
be
very
happy
cried
bessie
alden
i
am
only
going
to
some
shops
but
i
will
drive
you
about
and
show
you
the
an
american
woman
who
respects
herself
said
westgate
turning
to
beaumont
with
her
bright
expository
air
must
buy
something
every
day
of
her
life
if
she
can
not
do
it
herself
she
must
send
out
some
member
of
her
family
for
the
purpose
so
bessie
goes
forth
to
fulfill
my
the
young
girl
had
walked
away
with
lord
lambeth
by
her
side
to
whom
she
was
talking
still
and
percy
beaumont
watched
them
as
they
passed
toward
the
house
she
fulfills
her
own
mission
he
presently
said
that
of
being
a
very
attractive
young
i
don
t
know
that
i
should
say
very
attractive
westgate
rejoined
she
is
not
so
much
that
as
she
is
charming
when
you
really
know
her
she
is
very
oh
indeed
said
percy
beaumont
extremely
shy
westgate
repeated
but
she
is
a
dear
good
girl
she
is
a
charming
species
of
girl
she
is
not
in
the
least
a
flirt
that
isn
t
at
all
her
line
she
doesn
t
know
the
alphabet
of
that
sort
of
thing
she
is
very
simple
very
serious
she
has
lived
a
great
deal
in
boston
with
another
sister
of
mine
the
eldest
of
us
who
married
a
bostonian
she
is
very
cultivated
not
at
all
like
me
i
am
not
in
the
least
cultivated
she
has
studied
immensely
and
read
everything
she
is
what
they
call
in
boston
a
rum
sort
of
girl
for
lambeth
to
get
hold
of
his
lordship
s
kinsman
privately
reflected
i
really
believe
westgate
continued
that
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
is
a
boston
superstructure
upon
a
new
york
fonds
or
perhaps
a
new
york
superstructure
upon
a
boston
fonds
at
any
rate
it
s
the
mixture
said
westgate
who
continued
to
give
percy
beaumont
a
great
deal
of
information
lord
lambeth
got
into
a
little
basket
phaeton
with
bessie
alden
and
she
drove
him
down
the
long
avenue
whose
extent
he
had
measured
on
foot
a
couple
of
hours
before
into
the
ancient
town
as
it
was
called
in
that
part
of
the
world
of
newport
the
ancient
town
was
a
curious
affair
a
collection
of
little
wooden
houses
painted
white
scattered
over
a
hillside
and
clustered
about
a
long
straight
street
paved
with
enormous
cobblestones
there
were
plenty
of
shops
a
large
proportion
of
which
appeared
to
be
those
of
fruit
vendors
with
piles
of
huge
watermelons
and
pumpkins
stacked
in
front
of
them
and
drawn
up
before
the
shops
or
bumping
about
on
the
cobblestones
were
innumerable
other
basket
phaetons
freighted
with
ladies
of
high
fashion
who
greeted
each
other
from
vehicle
to
vehicle
and
conversed
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
in
a
manner
that
struck
lord
lambeth
as
demonstrative
with
a
great
many
oh
my
dears
and
little
quick
exclamations
and
caresses
his
companion
went
into
seventeen
shops
he
amused
himself
with
counting
them
and
accumulated
at
the
bottom
of
the
phaeton
a
pile
of
bundles
that
hardly
left
the
young
englishman
a
place
for
his
feet
as
she
had
no
groom
nor
footman
he
sat
in
the
phaeton
to
hold
the
ponies
where
although
he
was
not
a
particularly
acute
observer
he
saw
much
to
entertain
him
especially
the
ladies
just
mentioned
who
wandered
up
and
down
with
the
appearance
of
a
kind
of
aimless
intentness
as
if
they
were
looking
for
something
to
buy
and
who
tripping
in
and
out
of
their
vehicles
displayed
remarkably
pretty
feet
it
all
seemed
to
lord
lambeth
very
odd
and
bright
and
gay
of
course
before
they
got
back
to
the
villa
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
desultory
conversation
with
bessie
alden
the
young
englishmen
spent
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
whole
of
many
successive
days
in
what
the
french
call
the
intimite
of
their
new
friends
they
agreed
that
it
was
extremely
jolly
that
they
had
never
known
anything
more
agreeable
it
is
not
proposed
to
narrate
minutely
the
incidents
of
their
sojourn
on
this
charming
shore
though
if
it
were
convenient
i
might
present
a
record
of
impressions
nonetheless
delectable
that
they
were
not
exhaustively
analyzed
many
of
them
still
linger
in
the
minds
of
our
travelers
attended
by
a
train
of
harmonious
images
images
of
brilliant
mornings
on
lawns
and
piazzas
that
overlooked
the
sea
of
innumerable
pretty
girls
of
infinite
lounging
and
talking
and
laughing
and
flirting
and
lunching
and
dining
of
universal
friendliness
and
frankness
of
occasions
on
which
they
knew
everyone
and
everything
and
had
an
extraordinary
sense
of
ease
of
drives
and
rides
in
the
late
afternoon
over
gleaming
beaches
on
long
sea
roads
beneath
a
sky
lighted
up
by
marvelous
sunsets
of
suppers
on
the
return
informal
irregular
agreeable
of
evenings
at
open
windows
or
on
the
perpetual
verandas
in
the
summer
starlight
above
the
warm
atlantic
the
young
englishmen
were
introduced
to
everybody
entertained
by
everybody
intimate
with
everybody
at
the
end
of
three
days
they
had
removed
their
luggage
from
the
hotel
and
had
gone
to
stay
with
westgate
a
step
to
which
percy
beaumont
at
first
offered
some
conscientious
opposition
i
call
his
opposition
conscientious
because
it
was
founded
upon
some
talk
that
he
had
had
on
the
second
day
with
bessie
alden
he
had
indeed
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
her
for
she
was
not
literally
always
in
conversation
with
lord
lambeth
he
had
meditated
upon
westgate
s
account
of
her
sister
and
he
discovered
for
himself
that
the
young
lady
was
clever
and
appeared
to
have
read
a
great
deal
she
seemed
very
nice
though
he
could
not
make
out
as
westgate
had
said
she
was
shy
if
she
was
shy
she
carried
it
off
very
well
mr
beaumont
she
had
said
please
tell
me
something
about
lord
lambeth
s
family
how
would
you
say
it
in
england
his
position
his
position
percy
beaumont
repeated
his
rank
or
whatever
you
call
it
unfortunately
we
haven
t
got
a
peerage
like
the
people
in
that
s
a
great
pity
said
beaumont
you
would
find
it
all
set
forth
there
so
much
better
than
i
can
do
he
is
a
peer
then
oh
yes
he
is
a
and
has
he
any
other
title
than
lord
lambeth
his
title
is
the
marquis
of
lambeth
said
beaumont
and
then
he
was
silent
bessie
alden
appeared
to
be
looking
at
him
with
interest
he
is
the
son
of
the
duke
of
bayswater
he
added
presently
the
eldest
son
the
only
and
are
his
parents
living
oh
yes
if
his
father
were
not
living
he
would
be
a
so
that
when
his
father
dies
pursued
bessie
alden
with
more
simplicity
than
might
have
been
expected
in
a
clever
girl
he
will
become
duke
of
bayswater
of
course
said
percy
beaumont
but
his
father
is
in
excellent
and
his
mother
beaumont
smiled
a
little
the
duchess
is
uncommonly
and
has
he
any
sisters
yes
there
are
and
what
are
they
called
one
of
them
is
married
she
is
the
countess
of
and
the
other
the
other
is
unmarried
she
is
plain
lady
bessie
alden
looked
at
him
a
moment
is
she
very
plain
beaumont
began
to
laugh
again
you
would
not
find
her
so
handsome
as
her
brother
he
said
and
it
was
after
this
that
he
attempted
to
dissuade
the
heir
of
the
duke
of
bayswater
from
accepting
westgate
s
invitation
depend
upon
it
he
said
that
girl
means
to
try
for
it
seems
to
me
you
are
doing
your
best
to
make
a
fool
of
me
the
modest
young
nobleman
answered
she
has
been
asking
me
said
beaumont
all
about
your
people
and
your
i
am
sure
it
is
very
good
of
her
lord
lambeth
rejoined
well
then
observed
his
companion
if
you
go
you
go
with
your
eyes
damn
my
eyes
exclaimed
lord
lambeth
if
one
is
to
be
a
dozen
times
a
day
at
the
house
it
is
a
great
deal
more
convenient
to
sleep
there
i
am
sick
of
traveling
up
and
down
this
beastly
since
he
had
determined
to
go
percy
beaumont
would
of
course
have
been
very
sorry
to
allow
him
to
go
alone
he
was
a
man
of
conscience
and
he
remembered
his
promise
to
the
duchess
it
was
obviously
the
memory
of
this
promise
that
made
him
say
to
his
companion
a
couple
of
days
later
that
he
rather
wondered
he
should
be
so
fond
of
that
girl
in
the
first
place
how
do
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
her
asked
lord
lambeth
and
in
the
second
place
why
shouldn
t
i
be
fond
of
her
i
shouldn
t
think
she
would
be
in
your
what
do
you
call
my
line
you
don
t
set
her
down
as
fast
exactly
so
westgate
tells
me
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
fast
girl
in
america
that
it
s
an
english
invention
and
that
the
term
has
no
meaning
all
the
better
it
s
an
animal
i
you
prefer
a
is
that
what
you
call
miss
alden
her
sister
tells
me
said
percy
beaumont
that
she
is
tremendously
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
she
is
certainly
very
well
said
beaumont
i
should
have
supposed
you
would
have
found
that
sort
of
thing
awfully
in
point
of
fact
lord
lambeth
rejoined
i
find
it
uncommonly
after
this
percy
beaumont
held
his
tongue
but
on
the
of
august
he
wrote
to
the
duchess
of
bayswater
he
was
as
i
have
said
a
man
of
conscience
and
he
had
a
strong
incorruptible
sense
of
the
proprieties
of
life
his
kinsman
meanwhile
was
having
a
great
deal
of
talk
with
bessie
alden
on
the
red
sea
rocks
beyond
the
lawn
in
the
course
of
long
island
rides
with
a
slow
return
in
the
glowing
twilight
on
the
deep
veranda
late
in
the
evening
lord
lambeth
who
had
stayed
at
many
houses
had
never
stayed
at
a
house
in
which
it
was
possible
for
a
young
man
to
converse
so
frequently
with
a
young
lady
this
young
lady
no
longer
applied
to
percy
beaumont
for
information
concerning
his
lordship
she
addressed
herself
directly
to
the
young
nobleman
she
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
some
of
which
bored
him
a
little
for
he
took
no
pleasure
in
talking
about
himself
lord
lambeth
said
bessie
alden
are
you
a
hereditary
legislator
oh
i
say
cried
lord
lambeth
don
t
make
me
call
myself
such
names
as
but
you
are
a
member
of
parliament
said
the
young
girl
i
don
t
like
the
sound
of
that
don
t
you
sit
in
the
house
of
lords
bessie
alden
went
on
very
seldom
said
lord
lambeth
is
it
an
important
position
she
asked
oh
dear
no
said
lord
lambeth
i
should
think
it
would
be
very
grand
said
bessie
alden
to
possess
simply
by
an
accident
of
birth
the
right
to
make
laws
for
a
great
ah
but
one
doesn
t
make
laws
it
s
a
great
i
don
t
believe
that
the
young
girl
declared
it
must
be
a
great
privilege
and
i
should
think
that
if
one
thought
of
it
in
the
right
way
from
a
high
point
of
view
it
would
be
very
the
less
one
thinks
of
it
the
better
lord
lambeth
affirmed
i
think
it
s
tremendous
said
bessie
alden
and
on
another
occasion
she
asked
him
if
he
had
any
tenantry
hereupon
it
was
that
as
i
have
said
he
was
a
little
bored
do
you
want
to
buy
up
their
leases
he
asked
well
have
you
got
any
livings
she
demanded
oh
i
say
he
cried
have
you
got
a
clergyman
that
is
looking
out
but
she
made
him
tell
her
that
he
had
a
castle
he
confessed
to
but
one
it
was
the
place
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
and
as
he
had
an
liking
for
it
he
was
beguiled
into
describing
it
a
little
and
saying
it
was
really
very
jolly
bessie
alden
listened
with
great
interest
and
declared
that
she
would
give
the
world
to
see
such
a
place
whereupon
it
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
to
come
and
stay
there
said
lord
lambeth
he
took
a
vague
satisfaction
in
the
circumstance
that
percy
beaumont
had
not
heard
him
make
the
remark
i
have
just
recorded
westgate
all
this
time
had
not
as
they
said
at
newport
come
his
wife
more
than
once
announced
that
she
expected
him
on
the
morrow
but
on
the
morrow
she
wandered
about
a
little
with
a
telegram
in
her
jeweled
fingers
declaring
it
was
very
tiresome
that
his
business
detained
him
in
new
york
that
he
could
only
hope
the
englishmen
were
having
a
good
time
i
must
say
said
westgate
that
it
is
no
thanks
to
him
if
you
and
she
went
on
to
explain
while
she
continued
that
promenade
which
enabled
her
skirts
to
display
themselves
so
advantageously
that
unfortunately
in
america
there
was
no
leisure
class
it
was
lord
lambeth
s
theory
freely
propounded
when
the
young
men
were
together
that
percy
beaumont
was
having
a
very
good
time
with
westgate
and
that
under
the
pretext
of
meeting
for
the
purpose
of
animated
discussion
they
were
indulging
in
practices
that
imparted
a
shade
of
hypocrisy
to
the
lady
s
regret
for
her
husband
s
absence
i
assure
you
we
are
always
discussing
and
differing
said
percy
beaumont
she
is
awfully
argumentative
american
ladies
certainly
don
t
mind
contradicting
you
upon
my
word
i
don
t
think
i
was
ever
treated
so
by
a
woman
before
she
s
so
devilish
westgate
s
positive
quality
however
evidently
had
its
attractions
for
beaumont
was
constantly
at
his
hostess
s
side
he
detached
himself
one
day
to
the
extent
of
going
to
new
york
to
talk
over
the
tennessee
central
with
westgate
but
he
was
absent
only
hours
during
which
with
westgate
s
assistance
he
completely
settled
this
piece
of
business
they
certainly
do
things
quickly
in
new
york
he
observed
to
his
cousin
and
he
added
that
westgate
had
seemed
very
uneasy
lest
his
wife
should
miss
her
visitor
he
had
been
in
such
an
awful
hurry
to
send
him
back
to
her
i
m
afraid
you
ll
never
come
up
to
an
american
husband
if
that
s
what
the
wives
expect
he
said
to
lord
lambeth
westgate
however
was
not
to
enjoy
much
longer
the
entertainment
with
which
an
indulgent
husband
had
desired
to
keep
her
provided
on
the
of
august
lord
lambeth
received
a
telegram
from
his
mother
requesting
him
to
return
immediately
to
england
his
father
had
been
taken
ill
and
it
was
his
filial
duty
to
come
to
him
the
young
englishman
was
visibly
annoyed
what
the
deuce
does
it
mean
he
asked
of
his
kinsman
what
am
i
to
do
percy
beaumont
was
annoyed
as
well
he
had
deemed
it
his
duty
as
i
have
narrated
to
write
to
the
duchess
but
he
had
not
expected
that
this
distinguished
woman
would
act
so
promptly
upon
his
hint
it
means
he
said
that
your
father
is
laid
up
i
don
t
suppose
it
s
anything
serious
but
you
have
no
option
take
the
first
steamer
but
don
t
be
lord
lambeth
made
his
farewells
but
the
few
last
words
that
he
exchanged
with
bessie
alden
are
the
only
ones
that
have
a
place
in
our
record
of
course
i
needn
t
assure
you
he
said
that
if
you
should
come
to
england
next
year
i
expect
to
be
the
first
person
that
you
inform
of
bessie
alden
looked
at
him
a
little
and
she
smiled
oh
if
we
come
to
london
she
answered
i
should
think
you
would
hear
of
percy
beaumont
returned
with
his
cousin
and
his
sense
of
duty
compelled
him
one
windless
afternoon
in
to
say
to
lord
lambeth
that
he
suspected
that
the
duchess
s
telegram
was
in
part
the
result
of
something
he
himself
had
written
to
her
i
wrote
to
her
as
i
explicitly
notified
you
i
had
promised
to
do
that
you
were
extremely
interested
in
a
little
american
lord
lambeth
was
extremely
angry
and
he
indulged
for
some
moments
in
the
simple
language
of
indignation
but
i
have
said
that
he
was
a
reasonable
young
man
and
i
can
give
no
better
proof
of
it
than
the
fact
that
he
remarked
to
his
companion
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
you
were
quite
right
after
all
i
am
very
much
interested
in
her
only
to
be
fair
he
added
you
should
have
told
my
mother
also
that
she
is
not
seriously
interested
in
percy
beaumont
gave
a
little
laugh
there
is
nothing
so
charming
as
modesty
in
a
young
man
in
your
position
that
speech
is
a
capital
proof
that
you
are
sweet
on
she
is
not
interested
she
is
not
lord
lambeth
repeated
my
dear
fellow
said
his
companion
you
are
very
far
part
ii
in
point
of
fact
as
percy
beaumont
would
have
said
westgate
disembarked
on
the
of
may
on
the
british
coast
she
was
accompanied
by
her
sister
but
she
was
not
attended
by
any
other
member
of
her
family
to
the
deprivation
of
her
husband
s
society
westgate
was
however
habituated
she
had
made
half
a
dozen
journeys
to
europe
without
him
and
she
now
accounted
for
his
absence
to
interrogative
friends
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
by
allusion
to
the
regrettable
but
conspicuous
fact
that
in
america
there
was
no
leisure
class
the
two
ladies
came
up
to
london
and
alighted
at
jones
s
hotel
where
westgate
who
had
made
on
former
occasions
the
most
agreeable
impression
at
this
establishment
received
an
obsequious
greeting
bessie
alden
had
felt
much
excited
about
coming
to
england
she
had
expected
the
associations
would
be
very
charming
that
it
would
be
an
infinite
pleasure
to
rest
her
eyes
upon
the
things
she
had
read
about
in
the
poets
and
historians
she
was
very
fond
of
the
poets
and
historians
of
the
picturesque
of
the
past
of
retrospect
of
mementos
and
reverberations
of
greatness
so
that
on
coming
into
the
english
world
where
strangeness
and
familiarity
would
go
hand
in
hand
she
was
prepared
for
a
multitude
of
fresh
emotions
they
began
very
promptly
these
tender
fluttering
sensations
they
began
with
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
english
landscape
whose
dark
richness
was
quickened
and
brightened
by
the
season
with
the
carpeted
fields
and
flowering
hedgerows
as
she
looked
at
them
from
the
window
of
the
train
with
the
spires
of
the
rural
churches
peeping
above
the
treetops
with
the
parks
the
ancient
homes
the
cloudy
light
the
speech
the
manners
the
thousand
differences
westgate
s
impressions
had
of
course
much
less
novelty
and
keenness
and
she
gave
but
a
wandering
attention
to
her
sister
s
ejaculations
and
rhapsodies
you
know
my
enjoyment
of
england
is
not
so
intellectual
as
bessie
s
she
said
to
several
of
her
friends
in
the
course
of
her
visit
to
this
country
and
yet
if
it
is
not
intellectual
i
can
t
say
it
is
physical
i
don
t
think
i
can
quite
say
what
it
is
my
enjoyment
of
when
once
it
was
settled
that
the
two
ladies
should
come
abroad
and
should
spend
a
few
weeks
in
england
on
their
way
to
the
continent
they
of
course
exchanged
a
good
many
allusions
to
their
london
acquaintance
it
will
certainly
be
much
nicer
having
friends
there
bessie
alden
had
said
one
day
as
she
sat
on
the
sunny
deck
of
the
steamer
at
her
sister
s
feet
on
a
large
blue
rug
whom
do
you
mean
by
friends
westgate
asked
all
those
english
gentlemen
whom
you
have
known
and
entertained
captain
littledale
for
instance
and
lord
lambeth
and
beaumont
added
bessie
alden
do
you
expect
them
to
give
us
a
very
grand
reception
bessie
reflected
a
moment
she
was
addicted
as
we
know
to
reflection
well
my
poor
sweet
child
murmured
her
sister
what
have
i
said
that
is
so
silly
asked
bessie
you
are
a
little
too
simple
just
a
little
it
is
very
becoming
but
it
pleases
people
at
your
i
am
certainly
too
simple
to
understand
you
said
bessie
shall
i
tell
you
a
story
asked
her
sister
if
you
would
be
so
good
that
is
what
they
do
to
amuse
simple
westgate
consulted
her
memory
while
her
companion
sat
gazing
at
the
shining
sea
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
duke
of
i
think
not
said
bessie
well
it
s
no
matter
her
sister
went
on
it
s
a
proof
of
my
my
story
is
meant
to
illustrate
that
of
some
other
people
said
westgate
the
duke
of
is
what
they
call
in
england
a
great
swell
and
some
five
years
ago
he
came
to
america
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
new
york
and
in
new
york
he
spent
his
days
and
his
nights
at
the
butterworths
you
have
heard
at
least
of
the
butterworths
bien
they
did
everything
in
the
world
for
him
they
turned
themselves
inside
out
they
gave
him
a
dozen
dinner
parties
and
balls
and
were
the
means
of
his
being
invited
to
fifty
more
at
first
he
used
to
come
into
butterworth
s
box
at
the
opera
in
a
tweed
traveling
suit
but
someone
stopped
that
at
any
rate
he
had
a
beautiful
time
and
they
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world
two
years
elapse
and
the
butterworths
come
abroad
and
go
to
london
the
first
thing
they
see
in
all
the
papers
in
england
those
things
are
in
the
most
prominent
place
is
that
the
duke
of
has
arrived
in
town
for
the
season
they
wait
a
little
and
then
butterworth
as
polite
as
ever
goes
and
leaves
a
card
they
wait
a
little
more
the
visit
is
not
returned
they
wait
three
weeks
silence
de
mort
the
duke
gives
no
sign
the
butterworths
see
a
lot
of
other
people
put
down
the
duke
of
as
a
rude
ungrateful
man
and
forget
all
about
him
one
fine
day
they
go
to
ascot
races
and
there
they
meet
him
face
to
face
he
stares
a
moment
and
then
comes
up
to
butterworth
taking
something
from
his
pocketbook
something
which
proves
to
be
a
banknote
i
m
glad
to
see
you
butterworth
he
says
so
that
i
can
pay
you
that
ten
pounds
i
lost
to
you
in
new
york
i
saw
the
other
day
you
remembered
our
bet
here
are
the
ten
pounds
butterworth
goodbye
and
off
he
goes
and
that
s
the
last
they
see
of
the
duke
of
is
that
your
story
asked
bessie
alden
don
t
you
think
it
s
interesting
her
sister
replied
i
don
t
believe
it
said
the
young
girl
ah
cried
westgate
you
are
not
so
simple
after
all
believe
it
or
not
as
you
please
there
is
no
smoke
without
is
that
the
way
asked
bessie
after
a
moment
that
you
expect
your
friends
to
treat
you
i
defy
them
to
treat
me
very
ill
because
i
shall
not
give
them
the
opportunity
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
in
that
case
they
can
t
be
very
bessie
alden
was
silent
a
moment
i
don
t
see
what
makes
you
talk
that
way
she
said
the
english
are
a
great
exactly
and
that
is
just
the
way
they
have
grown
great
by
dropping
you
when
you
have
ceased
to
be
useful
people
say
they
are
not
clever
but
i
think
they
are
very
you
know
you
have
liked
them
all
the
englishmen
you
have
seen
said
bessie
they
have
liked
me
her
sister
rejoined
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
and
of
course
one
likes
bessie
alden
resumed
for
some
moments
her
studies
in
sea
green
well
she
said
whether
they
like
me
or
not
i
mean
to
like
them
and
happily
she
added
lord
lambeth
does
not
owe
me
ten
during
the
first
few
days
after
their
arrival
at
jones
s
hotel
our
charming
americans
were
much
occupied
with
what
they
would
have
called
looking
about
them
they
found
occasion
to
make
a
large
number
of
purchases
and
their
opportunities
for
conversation
were
such
only
as
were
offered
by
the
deferential
london
shopmen
bessie
alden
even
in
driving
from
the
station
took
an
immense
fancy
to
the
british
metropolis
and
at
the
risk
of
exhibiting
her
as
a
young
woman
of
vulgar
tastes
it
must
be
recorded
that
for
a
considerable
period
she
desired
no
higher
pleasure
than
to
drive
about
the
crowded
streets
in
a
hansom
cab
to
her
attentive
eyes
they
were
full
of
a
strange
picturesque
life
and
it
is
at
least
beneath
the
dignity
of
our
historic
muse
to
enumerate
the
trivial
objects
and
incidents
which
this
simple
young
lady
from
boston
found
so
entertaining
it
may
be
freely
mentioned
however
that
whenever
after
a
round
of
visits
in
bond
street
and
regent
street
she
was
about
to
return
with
her
sister
to
jones
s
hotel
she
made
an
earnest
request
that
they
should
be
driven
home
by
way
of
westminster
abbey
she
had
begun
by
asking
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
take
the
tower
on
the
way
to
their
lodgings
but
it
happened
that
at
a
more
primitive
stage
of
her
culture
westgate
had
paid
a
visit
to
this
venerable
monument
which
she
spoke
of
ever
afterward
vaguely
as
a
dreadful
disappointment
so
that
she
expressed
the
liveliest
disapproval
of
any
attempt
to
combine
historical
researches
with
the
purchase
of
hairbrushes
and
notepaper
the
most
she
would
consent
to
do
in
this
line
was
to
spend
half
an
hour
at
madame
tussaud
s
where
she
saw
several
dusty
wax
effigies
of
members
of
the
royal
family
she
told
bessie
that
if
she
wished
to
go
to
the
tower
she
must
get
someone
else
to
take
her
bessie
expressed
hereupon
an
earnest
disposition
to
go
alone
but
upon
this
proposal
as
well
westgate
sprinkled
cold
water
remember
she
said
that
you
are
not
in
your
innocent
little
boston
it
is
not
a
question
of
walking
up
and
down
beacon
then
she
went
on
to
explain
that
there
were
two
classes
of
american
girls
in
europe
those
that
walked
about
alone
and
those
that
did
not
you
happen
to
belong
my
dear
she
said
to
her
sister
to
the
class
that
does
it
is
only
answered
bessie
laughing
because
you
happen
to
prevent
and
she
devoted
much
private
meditation
to
this
question
of
effecting
a
visit
to
the
tower
of
london
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
the
problem
might
be
solved
the
two
ladies
at
jones
s
hotel
received
a
visit
from
willie
woodley
such
was
the
social
appellation
of
a
young
american
who
had
sailed
from
new
york
a
few
days
after
their
own
departure
and
who
having
the
privilege
of
intimacy
with
them
in
that
city
had
lost
no
time
on
his
arrival
in
london
in
coming
to
pay
them
his
respects
he
had
in
fact
gone
to
see
them
directly
after
going
to
see
his
tailor
than
which
there
can
be
no
greater
exhibition
of
promptitude
on
the
part
of
a
young
american
who
has
just
alighted
at
the
charing
cross
hotel
he
was
a
slim
pale
youth
of
the
most
amiable
disposition
famous
for
the
skill
with
which
he
led
the
german
in
new
york
indeed
by
the
young
ladies
who
habitually
figured
in
this
terpsichorean
revel
he
was
believed
to
be
the
best
dancer
in
the
world
it
was
in
these
terms
that
he
was
always
spoken
of
and
that
his
identity
was
indicated
he
was
the
gentlest
softest
young
man
it
was
possible
to
meet
he
was
beautifully
dressed
in
the
english
style
and
he
knew
an
immense
deal
about
london
he
had
been
at
newport
during
the
previous
summer
at
the
time
of
our
young
englishmen
s
visit
and
he
took
extreme
pleasure
in
the
society
of
bessie
alden
whom
he
always
addressed
as
miss
she
immediately
arranged
with
him
in
the
presence
of
her
sister
that
he
should
conduct
her
to
the
scene
of
anne
boleyn
s
execution
you
may
do
as
you
please
said
westgate
only
if
you
desire
the
information
it
is
not
the
custom
here
for
young
ladies
to
knock
about
london
with
young
miss
bessie
has
waltzed
with
me
so
often
observed
willie
woodley
she
can
surely
go
out
with
me
in
a
i
consider
waltzing
said
westgate
the
most
innocent
pleasure
of
our
it
s
a
compliment
to
our
time
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
a
little
laugh
in
spite
of
himself
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
regard
what
is
done
here
said
bessie
alden
why
should
i
suffer
the
restrictions
of
a
society
of
which
i
enjoy
none
of
the
privileges
that
s
very
good
very
good
murmured
willie
woodley
oh
go
to
the
tower
and
feel
the
ax
if
you
like
said
westgate
i
consent
to
your
going
with
woodley
but
i
should
not
let
you
go
with
an
miss
bessie
wouldn
t
care
to
go
with
an
englishman
woodley
declared
with
a
faint
asperity
that
was
perhaps
not
unnatural
in
a
young
man
who
dressing
in
the
manner
that
i
have
indicated
and
knowing
a
great
deal
as
i
have
said
about
london
saw
no
reason
for
drawing
these
sharp
distinctions
he
agreed
upon
a
day
with
miss
bessie
a
day
of
that
same
week
an
ingenious
mind
might
perhaps
trace
a
connection
between
the
young
girl
s
allusion
to
her
destitution
of
social
privileges
and
a
question
she
asked
on
the
morrow
as
she
sat
with
her
sister
at
lunch
don
t
you
mean
to
write
to
to
anyone
said
bessie
i
wrote
this
morning
to
captain
littledale
westgate
replied
but
woodley
said
that
captain
littledale
had
gone
to
he
said
he
thought
he
had
heard
so
he
knew
nothing
about
for
a
moment
bessie
alden
said
nothing
more
then
at
last
and
don
t
you
intend
to
write
to
to
beaumont
she
inquired
you
mean
to
lord
lambeth
said
her
sister
i
said
beaumont
because
he
was
so
good
a
friend
of
westgate
looked
at
the
young
girl
with
sisterly
candor
i
don
t
care
two
straws
for
you
were
certainly
very
nice
to
i
am
nice
to
everyone
said
westgate
simply
to
everyone
but
me
rejoined
bessie
smiling
her
sister
continued
to
look
at
her
then
at
last
are
you
in
love
with
lord
lambeth
she
asked
the
young
girl
stared
a
moment
and
the
question
was
apparently
too
humorous
even
to
make
her
blush
not
that
i
know
of
she
answered
because
if
you
are
westgate
went
on
i
shall
certainly
not
send
for
that
proves
what
i
said
declared
bessie
smiling
that
you
are
not
nice
to
it
would
be
a
poor
service
my
dear
child
said
her
sister
in
what
sense
there
is
nothing
against
lord
lambeth
that
i
know
westgate
was
silent
a
moment
you
are
in
love
with
him
then
bessie
stared
again
but
this
time
she
blushed
a
little
ah
if
you
won
t
be
serious
she
answered
we
will
not
mention
him
for
some
moments
lord
lambeth
was
not
mentioned
again
and
it
was
westgate
who
at
the
end
of
this
period
reverted
to
him
of
course
i
will
let
him
know
we
are
here
because
i
think
he
would
be
hurt
justly
enough
if
we
should
go
away
without
seeing
him
it
is
fair
to
give
him
a
chance
to
come
and
thank
me
for
the
kindness
we
showed
him
but
i
don
t
want
to
seem
neither
do
i
said
bessie
with
a
little
laugh
though
i
confess
added
her
sister
that
i
am
curious
to
see
how
he
will
he
behaved
very
well
at
newport
is
not
london
at
newport
he
could
do
as
he
liked
but
here
it
is
another
affair
he
has
to
have
an
eye
to
if
he
had
more
freedom
then
at
newport
argued
bessie
it
is
the
more
to
his
credit
that
he
behaved
well
and
if
he
has
to
be
so
careful
here
it
is
possible
he
will
behave
even
better
better
repeated
her
sister
my
dear
child
what
is
your
point
of
view
how
do
you
mean
my
point
of
view
don
t
you
care
for
lord
lambeth
a
little
this
time
bessie
alden
was
displeased
she
slowly
got
up
from
the
table
turning
her
face
away
from
her
sister
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
talking
so
she
said
westgate
sat
watching
her
for
some
moments
as
she
moved
slowly
about
the
room
and
went
and
stood
at
the
window
i
will
write
to
him
this
afternoon
she
said
at
last
do
as
you
please
bessie
answered
and
presently
she
turned
round
i
am
not
afraid
to
say
that
i
like
lord
lambeth
i
like
him
very
he
is
not
clever
westgate
declared
well
there
have
been
clever
people
whom
i
have
disliked
said
bessie
alden
so
that
i
suppose
i
may
like
a
stupid
one
besides
lord
lambeth
is
not
not
so
stupid
as
he
looks
exclaimed
her
sister
smiling
if
i
were
in
love
with
lord
lambeth
as
you
said
just
now
it
would
be
bad
policy
on
your
part
to
abuse
my
dear
child
don
t
give
me
lessons
in
policy
cried
westgate
the
policy
i
mean
to
follow
is
very
the
young
girl
began
to
walk
about
the
room
again
then
she
stopped
before
her
sister
i
have
never
heard
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
she
said
so
many
hints
and
innuendoes
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
in
plain
english
what
you
i
mean
that
you
may
be
much
that
is
still
only
a
hint
said
bessie
her
sister
looked
at
her
hesitating
an
instant
it
will
be
said
of
you
that
you
have
come
after
lord
lambeth
that
you
followed
bessie
alden
threw
back
her
pretty
head
like
a
startled
hind
and
a
look
flashed
into
her
face
that
made
westgate
rise
from
her
chair
who
says
such
things
as
that
she
demanded
people
i
don
t
believe
it
said
bessie
you
have
a
very
convenient
faculty
of
doubt
but
my
policy
will
be
as
i
say
very
deep
i
shall
leave
you
to
find
out
this
kind
of
thing
for
bessie
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
sister
and
westgate
thought
for
a
moment
there
were
tears
in
them
do
they
talk
that
way
here
she
asked
you
will
see
i
shall
leave
you
don
t
leave
me
alone
said
bessie
alden
take
me
no
i
want
to
see
what
you
make
of
it
her
sister
continued
i
don
t
you
will
understand
after
lord
lambeth
has
come
said
westgate
with
a
little
laugh
the
two
ladies
had
arranged
that
on
this
afternoon
willie
woodley
should
go
with
them
to
hyde
park
where
bessie
alden
expected
to
derive
much
entertainment
from
sitting
on
a
little
green
chair
under
the
great
trees
beside
rotten
row
the
want
of
a
suitable
escort
had
hitherto
rendered
this
pleasure
inaccessible
but
no
escort
now
for
such
an
expedition
could
have
been
more
suitable
than
their
devoted
young
countryman
whose
mission
in
life
it
might
almost
be
said
was
to
find
chairs
for
ladies
and
who
appeared
on
the
stroke
of
five
with
a
white
camellia
in
his
buttonhole
i
have
written
to
lord
lambeth
my
dear
said
westgate
to
her
sister
on
coming
into
the
room
where
bessie
alden
drawing
on
her
long
gray
gloves
was
entertaining
their
visitor
bessie
said
nothing
but
willie
woodley
exclaimed
that
his
lordship
was
in
town
he
had
seen
his
name
in
the
morning
post
do
you
read
the
morning
post
asked
westgate
oh
yes
it
s
great
fun
willie
woodley
affirmed
i
want
so
to
see
it
said
bessie
there
is
so
much
about
it
in
i
will
send
it
to
you
every
morning
said
willie
woodley
he
found
them
what
bessie
alden
thought
excellent
places
under
the
great
trees
beside
the
famous
avenue
whose
humors
had
been
made
familiar
to
the
young
girl
s
childhood
by
the
pictures
in
punch
the
day
was
bright
and
warm
and
the
crowd
of
riders
and
spectators
and
the
great
procession
of
carriages
were
proportionately
dense
and
brilliant
the
scene
bore
the
stamp
of
the
london
season
at
its
height
and
bessie
alden
found
more
entertainment
in
it
than
she
was
able
to
express
to
her
companions
she
sat
silent
under
her
parasol
and
her
imagination
according
to
its
wont
let
itself
loose
into
the
great
changing
assemblage
of
striking
and
suggestive
figures
they
stirred
up
a
host
of
old
impressions
and
preconceptions
and
she
found
herself
fitting
a
history
to
this
person
and
a
theory
to
that
and
making
a
place
for
them
all
in
her
little
private
museum
of
types
but
if
she
said
little
her
sister
on
one
side
and
willie
woodley
on
the
other
expressed
themselves
in
lively
alternation
look
at
that
green
dress
with
blue
flounces
said
westgate
quelle
toilette
that
s
the
marquis
of
blackborough
said
the
young
man
the
one
in
the
white
coat
i
heard
him
speak
the
other
night
in
the
house
of
lords
it
was
something
about
ramrods
he
called
them
he
s
an
awful
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
the
way
they
are
pinned
back
westgate
resumed
they
never
know
where
to
they
do
nothing
but
stop
said
willie
woodley
it
prevents
them
from
walking
here
comes
a
great
celebrity
lady
beatrice
bellevue
she
s
awfully
fast
see
what
little
steps
she
well
my
dear
westgate
pursued
i
hope
you
are
getting
some
ideas
for
your
couturiere
i
am
getting
plenty
of
ideas
said
bessie
but
i
don
t
know
that
my
couturiere
would
appreciate
willie
woodley
presently
perceived
a
friend
on
horseback
who
drove
up
beside
the
barrier
of
the
row
and
beckoned
to
him
he
went
forward
and
the
crowd
of
pedestrians
closed
about
him
so
that
for
some
ten
minutes
he
was
hidden
from
sight
at
last
he
reappeared
bringing
a
gentleman
with
him
a
gentleman
whom
bessie
at
first
supposed
to
be
his
friend
dismounted
but
at
a
second
glance
she
found
herself
looking
at
lord
lambeth
who
was
shaking
hands
with
her
sister
i
found
him
over
there
said
willie
woodley
and
i
told
him
you
were
and
then
lord
lambeth
touching
his
hat
a
little
shook
hands
with
bessie
fancy
your
being
here
he
said
he
was
blushing
and
smiling
he
looked
very
handsome
and
he
had
a
kind
of
splendor
that
he
had
not
had
in
america
bessie
alden
s
imagination
as
we
know
was
just
then
in
exercise
so
that
the
tall
young
englishman
as
he
stood
there
looking
down
at
her
had
the
benefit
of
it
he
is
handsomer
and
more
splendid
than
anything
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
to
herself
and
then
she
remembered
that
he
was
a
marquis
and
she
thought
he
looked
like
a
marquis
i
say
you
know
he
cried
you
ought
to
have
let
a
man
know
you
were
here
i
wrote
to
you
an
hour
ago
said
westgate
doesn
t
all
the
world
know
it
asked
bessie
smiling
i
assure
you
i
didn
t
know
it
cried
lord
lambeth
upon
my
honor
i
hadn
t
heard
of
it
ask
woodley
now
had
i
woodley
well
i
think
you
are
rather
a
humbug
said
willie
woodley
you
don
t
believe
that
do
you
miss
alden
asked
his
lordship
you
don
t
believe
i
m
a
humbug
eh
no
said
bessie
i
don
you
are
too
tall
to
stand
up
lord
lambeth
westgate
observed
you
are
only
tolerable
when
you
sit
down
be
so
good
as
to
get
a
he
found
a
chair
and
placed
it
sidewise
close
to
the
two
ladies
if
i
hadn
t
met
woodley
i
should
never
have
found
you
he
went
on
should
i
woodley
well
i
guess
not
said
the
young
american
not
even
with
my
letter
asked
westgate
ah
well
i
haven
t
got
your
letter
yet
i
suppose
i
shall
get
it
this
evening
it
was
awfully
kind
of
you
to
so
i
said
to
bessie
observed
westgate
did
she
say
so
miss
alden
lord
lambeth
inquired
i
daresay
you
have
been
here
a
we
have
been
here
three
said
westgate
have
you
been
here
three
months
the
young
man
asked
again
of
bessie
it
seems
a
long
time
bessie
answered
i
say
after
that
you
had
better
not
call
me
a
humbug
cried
lord
lambeth
i
have
only
been
in
town
three
weeks
but
you
must
have
been
hiding
away
i
haven
t
seen
you
where
should
you
have
seen
us
where
should
we
have
gone
asked
westgate
you
should
have
gone
to
hurlingham
said
willie
woodley
no
let
lord
lambeth
tell
us
westgate
insisted
there
are
plenty
of
places
to
go
to
said
lord
lambeth
each
one
stupider
than
the
other
i
mean
people
s
houses
they
send
you
no
one
has
sent
us
cards
said
bessie
we
are
very
quiet
her
sister
declared
we
are
here
as
we
have
been
to
madame
tussaud
s
bessie
pursued
oh
i
say
cried
lord
lambeth
we
thought
we
should
find
your
image
there
said
westgate
yours
and
beaumont
in
the
chamber
of
horrors
laughed
the
young
man
it
did
duty
very
well
for
a
party
said
westgate
all
the
women
were
decolletes
and
many
of
the
figures
looked
as
if
they
could
speak
if
they
upon
my
word
lord
lambeth
rejoined
you
see
people
at
london
parties
that
look
as
if
they
couldn
t
speak
if
they
do
you
think
woodley
could
find
us
beaumont
asked
westgate
lord
lambeth
stared
and
looked
round
him
i
daresay
he
could
beaumont
often
comes
here
don
t
you
think
you
could
find
him
woodley
make
a
dive
into
the
thank
you
i
have
had
enough
diving
said
willie
woodley
i
will
wait
till
beaumont
comes
to
the
i
will
bring
him
to
see
you
said
lord
lambeth
where
are
you
staying
you
will
find
the
address
in
my
letter
jones
s
oh
one
of
those
places
just
out
of
piccadilly
beastly
hole
isn
t
it
lord
lambeth
inquired
i
believe
it
s
the
best
hotel
in
london
said
westgate
but
they
give
you
awful
rubbish
to
eat
don
t
they
his
lordship
went
on
yes
said
westgate
i
always
feel
so
sorry
for
the
people
that
come
up
to
town
and
go
to
live
in
those
places
continued
the
young
man
they
eat
nothing
but
oh
i
say
cried
willie
woodley
well
how
do
you
like
london
miss
alden
lord
lambeth
asked
unperturbed
by
this
ejaculation
i
think
it
s
grand
said
bessie
alden
my
sister
likes
it
in
spite
of
the
filth
westgate
exclaimed
i
hope
you
are
going
to
stay
a
long
as
long
as
i
can
said
bessie
and
where
is
westgate
asked
lord
lambeth
of
this
gentleman
s
wife
he
s
where
he
always
is
in
that
tiresome
new
he
must
be
tremendously
clever
said
the
young
man
i
suppose
he
is
said
westgate
lord
lambeth
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
with
his
american
friends
but
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
relate
their
conversation
in
full
he
addressed
a
great
many
remarks
to
bessie
alden
and
finally
turned
toward
her
altogether
while
willie
woodley
entertained
westgate
bessie
herself
said
very
little
she
was
on
her
guard
thinking
of
what
her
sister
had
said
to
her
at
lunch
little
by
little
however
she
interested
herself
in
lord
lambeth
again
as
she
had
done
at
newport
only
it
seemed
to
her
that
here
he
might
become
more
interesting
he
would
be
an
unconscious
part
of
the
antiquity
the
impressiveness
the
picturesqueness
of
england
and
poor
bessie
alden
like
many
a
yankee
maiden
was
terribly
at
the
mercy
of
picturesqueness
i
have
often
wished
i
were
at
newport
again
said
the
young
man
those
days
i
spent
at
your
sister
s
were
awfully
we
enjoyed
them
very
much
i
hope
your
father
is
oh
dear
yes
when
i
got
to
england
he
was
out
grouse
shooting
it
was
what
you
call
in
america
a
gigantic
fraud
my
mother
had
got
nervous
my
three
weeks
at
newport
seemed
like
a
happy
america
certainly
is
very
different
from
england
said
bessie
i
hope
you
like
england
better
eh
lord
lambeth
rejoined
almost
persuasively
no
englishman
can
ask
that
seriously
of
a
person
of
another
her
companion
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
you
mean
it
s
a
matter
of
course
if
i
were
english
said
bessie
it
would
certainly
seem
to
me
a
matter
of
course
that
everyone
should
be
a
good
oh
dear
yes
patriotism
is
everything
said
lord
lambeth
not
quite
following
but
very
contented
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
here
on
thursday
i
am
going
to
the
the
tower
the
tower
of
london
did
you
never
hear
of
it
oh
yes
i
have
been
there
said
lord
lambeth
i
was
taken
there
by
my
governess
when
i
was
six
years
old
it
s
a
rum
idea
your
going
do
give
me
a
few
more
rum
ideas
said
bessie
i
want
to
see
everything
of
that
sort
i
am
going
to
hampton
court
and
to
windsor
and
to
the
dulwich
lord
lambeth
seemed
greatly
amused
i
wonder
you
don
t
go
to
the
rosherville
are
they
interesting
asked
bessie
oh
are
they
very
old
that
s
all
i
care
for
said
bessie
they
are
tremendously
old
they
are
all
falling
to
i
think
there
is
nothing
so
charming
as
an
old
ruinous
garden
said
the
young
girl
we
must
certainly
go
lord
lambeth
broke
out
into
merriment
i
say
woodley
he
cried
here
s
miss
alden
wants
to
go
to
the
rosherville
gardens
willie
woodley
looked
a
little
blank
he
was
caught
in
the
fact
of
ignorance
of
an
apparently
conspicuous
feature
of
london
life
but
in
a
moment
he
turned
it
off
very
well
he
said
i
ll
write
for
a
lord
lambeth
s
exhilaration
increased
gad
i
believe
you
americans
would
go
anywhere
he
cried
we
wish
to
go
to
parliament
said
bessie
that
s
one
of
the
first
oh
it
would
bore
you
to
death
cried
the
young
man
we
wish
to
hear
you
i
never
speak
except
to
young
ladies
said
lord
lambeth
smiling
bessie
alden
looked
at
him
a
while
smiling
too
in
the
shadow
of
her
parasol
you
are
very
strange
she
murmured
i
don
t
think
i
approve
of
ah
now
don
t
be
severe
miss
alden
said
lord
lambeth
smiling
still
more
please
don
t
be
severe
i
want
you
to
like
me
to
like
you
awfully
you
must
not
laugh
at
me
then
when
i
make
mistakes
i
consider
it
my
right
as
a
freeborn
american
to
make
as
many
mistakes
as
i
upon
my
word
i
didn
t
laugh
at
you
said
lord
lambeth
and
not
only
that
bessie
went
on
but
i
hold
that
all
my
mistakes
shall
be
set
down
to
my
credit
you
must
think
the
better
of
me
for
i
can
t
think
better
of
you
than
i
do
the
young
man
declared
bessie
alden
looked
at
him
a
moment
again
you
certainly
speak
very
well
to
young
ladies
but
why
don
t
you
address
the
house
isn
t
that
what
they
call
it
because
i
have
nothing
to
say
said
lord
lambeth
haven
t
you
a
great
position
asked
bessie
alden
he
looked
a
moment
at
the
back
of
his
glove
i
ll
set
that
down
he
said
as
one
of
your
mistakes
to
your
and
as
if
he
disliked
talking
about
his
position
he
changed
the
subject
i
wish
you
would
let
me
go
with
you
to
the
tower
and
to
hampton
court
and
to
all
those
other
we
shall
be
most
happy
said
bessie
and
of
course
i
shall
be
delighted
to
show
you
the
house
of
lords
some
day
that
suits
you
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
want
to
do
for
you
i
want
to
make
you
have
a
good
time
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
present
some
of
my
friends
to
you
if
it
wouldn
t
bore
you
then
it
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
to
come
down
to
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
lord
lambeth
said
bessie
what
is
branches
it
s
a
house
in
the
country
i
think
you
might
like
willie
woodley
and
westgate
at
this
moment
were
sitting
in
silence
and
the
young
man
s
ear
caught
these
last
words
of
lord
lambeth
s
he
s
inviting
miss
bessie
to
one
of
his
castles
he
murmured
to
his
companion
westgate
foreseeing
what
she
mentally
called
complications
immediately
got
up
and
the
two
ladies
taking
leave
of
lord
lambeth
returned
under
woodley
s
conduct
to
jones
s
hotel
lord
lambeth
came
to
see
them
on
the
morrow
bringing
percy
beaumont
with
him
the
latter
having
instantly
declared
his
intention
of
neglecting
none
of
the
usual
offices
of
civility
this
declaration
however
when
his
kinsman
informed
him
of
the
advent
of
their
american
friends
had
been
preceded
by
another
remark
here
they
are
then
and
you
are
in
for
what
am
i
in
for
demanded
lord
lambeth
i
will
let
your
mother
give
it
a
name
with
all
respect
to
whom
added
percy
beaumont
i
must
decline
on
this
occasion
to
do
any
more
police
duty
her
grace
must
look
after
you
i
will
give
her
a
chance
said
her
grace
s
son
a
trifle
grimly
i
shall
make
her
go
and
see
she
won
t
do
it
my
we
ll
see
if
she
doesn
t
said
lord
lambeth
but
if
percy
beaumont
took
a
somber
view
of
the
arrival
of
the
two
ladies
at
jones
s
hotel
he
was
sufficiently
a
man
of
the
world
to
offer
them
a
smiling
countenance
he
fell
into
animated
conversation
conversation
at
least
that
was
animated
on
her
side
with
westgate
while
his
companion
made
himself
agreeable
to
the
younger
lady
westgate
began
confessing
and
protesting
declaring
and
expounding
i
must
say
london
is
a
great
deal
brighter
and
prettier
just
now
than
it
was
when
i
was
here
last
in
the
month
of
november
there
is
evidently
a
great
deal
going
on
and
you
seem
to
have
a
good
many
flowers
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
very
charming
for
all
you
people
and
that
you
amuse
yourselves
immensely
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
let
bessie
and
me
come
and
sit
and
look
at
you
i
suppose
you
will
think
i
am
very
satirical
but
i
must
confess
that
that
s
the
feeling
i
have
in
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
quite
understand
to
what
feeling
you
allude
said
percy
beaumont
the
feeling
that
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
english
people
everything
is
beautifully
arranged
for
it
seems
to
me
it
is
very
well
for
some
americans
sometimes
rejoined
beaumont
for
some
of
them
yes
if
they
like
to
be
patronized
but
i
must
say
i
don
t
like
to
be
patronized
i
may
be
very
eccentric
and
undisciplined
and
outrageous
but
i
confess
i
never
was
fond
of
patronage
i
like
to
associate
with
people
on
the
same
terms
as
i
do
in
my
own
country
that
s
a
peculiar
taste
that
i
have
but
here
people
seem
to
expect
something
else
heaven
knows
what
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
i
am
very
ungrateful
for
i
certainly
have
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
the
last
time
i
was
here
a
lady
sent
me
a
message
that
i
was
at
liberty
to
come
and
see
dear
me
i
hope
you
didn
t
go
observed
percy
beaumont
you
are
deliciously
naive
i
must
say
that
for
you
westgate
exclaimed
it
must
be
a
great
advantage
to
you
here
in
london
i
suppose
that
if
i
myself
had
a
little
more
naivete
i
should
enjoy
it
more
i
should
be
content
to
sit
on
a
chair
in
the
park
and
see
the
people
pass
and
be
told
that
this
is
the
duchess
of
suffolk
and
that
is
the
lord
chamberlain
and
that
i
must
be
thankful
for
the
privilege
of
beholding
them
i
daresay
it
is
very
wicked
and
critical
of
me
to
ask
for
anything
else
but
i
was
always
critical
and
i
freely
confess
to
the
sin
of
being
fastidious
i
am
told
there
is
some
remarkably
superior
society
provided
here
for
strangers
merci
i
don
t
want
any
superior
society
i
want
the
society
that
i
have
been
accustomed
i
hope
you
don
t
call
lambeth
and
me
second
rate
beaumont
interposed
oh
i
am
accustomed
to
you
said
westgate
do
you
know
that
you
english
sometimes
make
the
most
wonderful
speeches
the
first
time
i
came
to
london
i
went
out
to
dine
as
i
told
you
i
have
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
after
dinner
in
the
drawing
room
i
had
some
conversation
with
an
old
lady
i
assure
you
i
had
i
forget
what
we
talked
about
but
she
presently
said
in
allusion
to
something
we
were
discussing
oh
you
know
the
aristocracy
do
but
in
one
s
own
class
of
life
it
is
very
in
one
s
own
class
of
life
what
is
a
poor
unprotected
american
woman
to
do
in
a
country
where
she
is
liable
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
said
to
her
you
seem
to
get
hold
of
some
very
queer
old
ladies
i
compliment
you
on
your
acquaintance
percy
beaumont
exclaimed
if
you
are
trying
to
bring
me
to
admit
that
london
is
an
odious
place
you
ll
not
succeed
i
m
extremely
fond
of
it
and
i
think
it
the
jolliest
place
in
the
pour
vous
autres
i
never
said
the
contrary
westgate
retorted
i
make
use
of
this
expression
because
both
interlocutors
had
begun
to
raise
their
voices
percy
beaumont
naturally
did
not
like
to
hear
his
country
abused
and
westgate
no
less
naturally
did
not
like
a
stubborn
debater
hallo
said
lord
lambeth
what
are
they
up
to
now
and
he
came
away
from
the
window
where
he
had
been
standing
with
bessie
alden
i
quite
agree
with
a
very
clever
countrywoman
of
mine
westgate
continued
with
charming
ardor
though
with
imperfect
relevancy
she
smiled
at
the
two
gentlemen
for
a
moment
with
terrible
brightness
as
if
to
toss
at
their
feet
upon
their
native
heath
the
gauntlet
of
defiance
for
me
there
are
only
two
social
positions
worth
speaking
of
that
of
an
american
lady
and
that
of
the
emperor
of
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
american
gentlemen
asked
lord
lambeth
she
leaves
them
in
america
said
percy
beaumont
on
the
departure
of
their
visitors
bessie
alden
told
her
sister
that
lord
lambeth
would
come
the
next
day
to
go
with
them
to
the
tower
and
that
he
had
kindly
offered
to
bring
his
trap
and
drive
them
thither
westgate
listened
in
silence
to
this
communication
and
for
some
time
afterward
she
said
nothing
but
at
last
if
you
had
not
requested
me
the
other
day
not
to
mention
it
she
began
there
is
something
i
should
venture
to
ask
bessie
frowned
a
little
her
dark
blue
eyes
were
more
dark
than
blue
but
her
sister
went
on
as
it
is
i
will
take
the
risk
you
are
not
in
love
with
lord
lambeth
i
believe
it
perfectly
very
good
but
is
there
by
chance
any
danger
of
your
becoming
so
it
s
a
very
simple
question
don
t
take
offense
i
have
a
particular
reason
said
westgate
for
wanting
to
bessie
alden
for
some
moments
said
nothing
she
only
looked
displeased
no
there
is
no
danger
she
answered
at
last
curtly
then
i
should
like
to
frighten
them
declared
westgate
clasping
her
jeweled
hands
to
frighten
whom
all
these
people
lord
lambeth
s
family
and
how
should
you
frighten
them
asked
the
young
girl
it
wouldn
t
be
i
it
would
be
you
it
would
frighten
them
to
think
that
you
should
absorb
his
lordship
s
young
bessie
alden
with
her
clear
eyes
still
overshadowed
by
her
dark
brows
continued
to
interrogate
why
should
that
frighten
them
westgate
poised
her
answer
with
a
smile
before
delivering
it
because
they
think
you
are
not
good
enough
you
are
a
charming
girl
beautiful
and
amiable
intelligent
and
clever
and
as
as
it
is
possible
to
be
but
you
are
not
a
fit
match
for
lord
bessie
alden
was
decidedly
disgusted
where
do
you
get
such
extraordinary
ideas
she
asked
you
have
said
some
such
strange
things
lately
my
dear
kitty
where
do
you
collect
them
kitty
was
evidently
enamored
of
her
idea
yes
it
would
put
them
on
pins
and
needles
and
it
wouldn
t
hurt
you
beaumont
is
already
most
uneasy
i
could
soon
see
the
young
girl
meditated
a
moment
do
you
mean
that
they
spy
upon
him
that
they
interfere
with
him
i
don
t
know
what
power
they
have
to
interfere
but
i
know
that
a
british
mama
may
worry
her
son
s
life
it
has
been
intimated
that
as
regards
certain
disagreeable
things
bessie
alden
had
a
fund
of
skepticism
she
abstained
on
the
present
occasion
from
expressing
disbelief
for
she
wished
not
to
irritate
her
sister
but
she
said
to
herself
that
kitty
had
been
misinformed
that
this
was
a
traveler
s
tale
though
she
was
a
girl
of
a
lively
imagination
there
could
in
the
nature
of
things
be
to
her
sense
no
reality
in
the
idea
of
her
belonging
to
a
vulgar
category
what
she
said
aloud
was
i
must
say
that
in
that
case
i
am
very
sorry
for
lord
westgate
more
and
more
exhilarated
by
her
scheme
was
smiling
at
her
again
if
i
could
only
believe
it
was
safe
she
exclaimed
when
you
begin
to
pity
him
i
on
my
side
am
afraid
of
what
of
your
pitying
him
too
bessie
alden
turned
away
impatiently
but
at
the
end
of
a
minute
she
turned
back
what
if
i
should
pity
him
too
much
she
asked
westgate
hereupon
turned
away
but
after
a
moment
s
reflection
she
also
faced
her
sister
again
it
would
come
after
all
to
the
same
thing
she
said
lord
lambeth
came
the
next
day
with
his
trap
and
the
two
ladies
attended
by
willie
woodley
placed
themselves
under
his
guidance
and
were
conveyed
eastward
through
some
of
the
duskier
portions
of
the
metropolis
to
the
great
turreted
donjon
which
overlooks
the
london
shipping
they
all
descended
from
their
vehicle
and
entered
the
famous
inclosure
and
they
secured
the
services
of
a
venerable
beefeater
who
though
there
were
many
other
claimants
for
legendary
information
made
a
fine
exclusive
party
of
them
and
marched
them
through
courts
and
corridors
through
armories
and
prisons
he
delivered
his
usual
peripatetic
discourse
and
they
stopped
and
stared
and
peeped
and
stooped
according
to
the
official
admonitions
bessie
alden
asked
the
old
man
in
the
crimson
doublet
a
great
many
questions
she
thought
it
a
most
fascinating
place
lord
lambeth
was
in
high
good
humor
he
was
constantly
laughing
he
enjoyed
what
he
would
have
called
the
lark
willie
woodley
kept
looking
at
the
ceilings
and
tapping
the
walls
with
the
knuckle
of
a
glove
and
westgate
asking
at
frequent
intervals
to
be
allowed
to
sit
down
and
wait
till
they
came
back
was
as
frequently
informed
that
they
would
never
come
back
to
a
great
many
of
bessie
s
questions
chiefly
on
collateral
points
of
english
history
the
ancient
warder
was
naturally
unable
to
reply
whereupon
she
always
appealed
to
lord
lambeth
but
his
lordship
was
very
ignorant
he
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
about
that
sort
of
thing
and
he
seemed
greatly
diverted
at
being
treated
as
an
authority
you
can
t
expect
everyone
to
know
as
much
as
you
he
said
i
should
expect
you
to
know
a
great
deal
more
declared
bessie
alden
women
always
know
more
than
men
about
names
and
dates
and
that
sort
of
thing
lord
lambeth
rejoined
there
was
lady
jane
grey
we
have
just
been
hearing
about
who
went
in
for
latin
and
greek
and
all
the
learning
of
her
you
have
no
right
to
be
ignorant
at
all
events
said
bessie
why
haven
t
i
as
good
a
right
as
anyone
else
because
you
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
all
these
what
things
do
you
mean
axes
and
blocks
and
thumbscrews
all
these
historical
things
you
belong
to
a
historical
bessie
is
really
too
historical
said
westgate
catching
a
word
of
this
dialogue
yes
you
are
too
historical
said
lord
lambeth
laughing
but
thankful
for
a
formula
upon
my
honor
you
are
too
historical
he
went
with
the
ladies
a
couple
of
days
later
to
hampton
court
willie
woodley
being
also
of
the
party
the
afternoon
was
charming
the
famous
horse
chestnuts
were
in
blossom
and
lord
lambeth
who
quite
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
cockney
excursionist
declared
that
it
was
a
jolly
old
place
bessie
alden
was
in
ecstasies
she
went
about
murmuring
and
exclaiming
it
s
too
lovely
said
the
young
girl
it
s
too
enchanting
it
s
too
exactly
what
it
ought
to
be
at
hampton
court
the
little
flocks
of
visitors
are
not
provided
with
an
official
bellwether
but
are
left
to
browse
at
discretion
upon
the
local
antiquities
it
happened
in
this
manner
that
in
default
of
another
informant
bessie
alden
who
on
doubtful
questions
was
able
to
suggest
a
great
many
alternatives
found
herself
again
applying
for
intellectual
assistance
to
lord
lambeth
but
he
again
assured
her
that
he
was
utterly
helpless
in
such
matters
that
his
education
had
been
sadly
neglected
and
i
am
sorry
it
makes
you
unhappy
he
added
in
a
moment
you
are
very
disappointing
lord
lambeth
she
said
ah
now
don
t
say
that
he
cried
that
s
the
worst
thing
you
could
possibly
no
she
rejoined
it
is
not
so
bad
as
to
say
that
i
had
expected
nothing
of
i
don
t
know
give
me
a
notion
of
the
sort
of
thing
you
well
said
bessie
alden
that
you
would
be
more
what
i
should
like
to
be
what
i
should
try
to
be
in
your
ah
my
place
exclaimed
lord
lambeth
you
are
always
talking
about
my
place
the
young
girl
looked
at
him
he
thought
she
colored
a
little
and
for
a
moment
she
made
no
rejoinder
does
it
strike
you
that
i
am
always
talking
about
your
place
she
asked
i
am
sure
you
do
it
a
great
honor
he
said
fearing
he
had
been
uncivil
i
have
often
thought
about
it
she
went
on
after
a
moment
i
have
often
thought
about
your
being
a
hereditary
legislator
a
hereditary
legislator
ought
to
know
a
great
many
not
if
he
doesn
t
but
you
do
legislate
it
s
absurd
your
saying
you
don
t
you
are
very
much
looked
up
to
here
i
am
assured
of
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
noticed
it
is
because
you
are
used
to
it
then
you
ought
to
fill
the
how
do
you
mean
to
fill
it
asked
lord
lambeth
you
ought
to
be
very
clever
and
brilliant
and
to
know
almost
lord
lambeth
looked
at
her
a
moment
shall
i
tell
you
something
he
asked
a
young
man
in
my
position
as
you
call
it
i
didn
t
invent
the
term
interposed
bessie
alden
i
have
seen
it
in
a
great
many
hang
it
you
are
always
at
your
books
a
fellow
in
my
position
then
does
very
well
whatever
he
does
that
s
about
what
i
mean
to
well
if
your
own
people
are
content
with
you
said
bessie
alden
laughing
it
is
not
for
me
to
complain
but
i
shall
always
think
that
properly
you
should
have
been
a
great
mind
a
great
ah
that
s
very
theoretic
lord
lambeth
declared
depend
upon
it
that
s
a
yankee
happy
the
country
said
bessie
alden
where
even
people
s
prejudices
are
so
elevated
well
after
all
observed
lord
lambeth
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
such
a
fool
as
you
are
trying
to
make
me
i
said
nothing
so
rude
as
that
but
i
must
repeat
that
you
are
my
dear
miss
alden
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
am
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
ah
if
it
were
not
for
that
said
bessie
alden
with
a
smile
westgate
had
a
good
many
more
friends
in
london
than
she
pretended
and
before
long
she
had
renewed
acquaintance
with
most
of
them
their
hospitality
was
extreme
so
that
one
thing
leading
to
another
she
began
as
the
phrase
is
to
go
out
bessie
alden
in
this
way
saw
something
of
what
she
found
it
a
great
satisfaction
to
call
to
herself
english
society
she
went
to
balls
and
danced
she
went
to
dinners
and
talked
she
went
to
concerts
and
listened
at
concerts
bessie
always
listened
she
went
to
exhibitions
and
wondered
her
enjoyment
was
keen
and
her
curiosity
insatiable
and
grateful
in
general
for
all
her
opportunities
she
especially
prized
the
privilege
of
meeting
certain
celebrated
persons
authors
and
artists
philosophers
and
statesmen
of
whose
renown
she
had
been
a
humble
and
distant
beholder
and
who
now
as
a
part
of
the
habitual
furniture
of
london
drawing
rooms
struck
her
as
stars
fallen
from
the
firmament
and
become
palpable
revealing
also
sometimes
on
contact
qualities
not
to
have
been
predicted
of
sidereal
bodies
bessie
who
knew
so
many
of
her
contemporaries
by
reputation
had
a
good
many
personal
disappointments
but
on
the
other
hand
she
had
innumerable
satisfactions
and
enthusiasms
and
she
communicated
the
emotions
of
either
class
to
a
dear
friend
of
her
own
sex
in
boston
with
whom
she
was
in
voluminous
correspondence
some
of
her
reflections
indeed
she
attempted
to
impart
to
lord
lambeth
who
came
almost
every
day
to
jones
s
hotel
and
whom
westgate
admitted
to
be
really
devoted
captain
littledale
it
appeared
had
gone
to
india
and
of
several
others
of
westgate
s
gentlemen
who
as
she
said
had
made
in
new
york
a
clubhouse
of
her
drawing
room
no
tidings
were
to
be
obtained
but
lord
lambeth
was
certainly
attentive
enough
to
make
up
for
the
accidental
absences
the
short
memories
all
the
other
irregularities
of
everyone
else
he
drove
them
in
the
park
he
took
them
to
visit
private
collections
of
pictures
and
having
a
house
of
his
own
invited
them
to
dinner
westgate
following
the
fashion
of
many
of
her
compatriots
caused
herself
and
her
sister
to
be
presented
at
the
english
court
by
her
diplomatic
representative
for
it
was
in
this
manner
that
she
alluded
to
the
american
minister
to
england
inquiring
what
on
earth
he
was
put
there
for
if
not
to
make
the
proper
arrangements
for
one
s
going
to
a
drawing
room
lord
lambeth
declared
that
he
hated
drawing
rooms
but
he
participated
in
the
ceremony
on
the
day
on
which
the
two
ladies
at
jones
s
hotel
repaired
to
buckingham
palace
in
a
remarkable
coach
which
his
lordship
had
sent
to
fetch
them
he
had
on
a
gorgeous
uniform
and
bessie
alden
was
particularly
struck
with
his
appearance
especially
when
on
her
asking
him
rather
foolishly
as
she
felt
if
he
were
a
loyal
subject
he
replied
that
he
was
a
loyal
subject
to
her
this
declaration
was
emphasized
by
his
dancing
with
her
at
a
royal
ball
to
which
the
two
ladies
afterward
went
and
was
not
impaired
by
the
fact
that
she
thought
he
danced
very
ill
he
seemed
to
her
wonderfully
kind
she
asked
herself
with
growing
vivacity
why
he
should
be
so
kind
it
was
his
disposition
that
seemed
the
natural
answer
she
had
told
her
sister
that
she
liked
him
very
much
and
now
that
she
liked
him
more
she
wondered
why
she
liked
him
for
his
disposition
to
this
question
as
well
that
seemed
the
natural
answer
when
once
the
impressions
of
london
life
began
to
crowd
thickly
upon
her
she
completely
forgot
her
sister
s
warning
about
the
cynicism
of
public
opinion
it
had
given
her
great
pain
at
the
moment
but
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
she
should
remember
it
it
corresponded
too
little
with
any
sensible
reality
and
it
was
disagreeable
to
bessie
to
remember
disagreeable
things
so
she
was
not
haunted
with
the
sense
of
a
vulgar
imputation
she
was
not
in
love
with
lord
lambeth
she
assured
herself
of
that
it
will
immediately
be
observed
that
when
such
assurances
become
necessary
the
state
of
a
young
lady
s
affections
is
already
ambiguous
and
indeed
bessie
alden
made
no
attempt
to
dissimulate
to
herself
of
course
a
certain
tenderness
that
she
felt
for
the
young
nobleman
she
said
to
herself
that
she
liked
the
type
to
which
he
belonged
the
simple
candid
manly
healthy
english
temperament
she
spoke
to
herself
of
him
as
women
speak
of
young
men
they
like
alluded
to
his
bravery
which
she
had
never
in
the
least
seen
tested
to
his
honesty
and
gentlemanliness
and
was
not
silent
upon
the
subject
of
his
good
looks
she
was
perfectly
conscious
moreover
that
she
liked
to
think
of
his
more
adventitious
merits
that
her
imagination
was
excited
and
gratified
by
the
sight
of
a
handsome
young
man
endowed
with
such
large
opportunities
opportunities
she
hardly
knew
for
what
but
as
she
supposed
for
doing
great
things
for
setting
an
example
for
exerting
an
influence
for
conferring
happiness
for
encouraging
the
arts
she
had
a
kind
of
ideal
of
conduct
for
a
young
man
who
should
find
himself
in
this
magnificent
position
and
she
tried
to
adapt
it
to
lord
lambeth
s
deportment
as
you
might
attempt
to
fit
a
silhouette
in
cut
paper
upon
a
shadow
projected
upon
a
wall
but
bessie
alden
s
silhouette
refused
to
coincide
with
his
lordship
s
image
and
this
want
of
harmony
sometimes
vexed
her
more
than
she
thought
reasonable
when
he
was
absent
it
was
of
course
less
striking
then
he
seemed
to
her
a
sufficiently
graceful
combination
of
high
responsibilities
and
amiable
qualities
but
when
he
sat
there
within
sight
laughing
and
talking
with
his
customary
good
humor
and
simplicity
she
measured
it
more
accurately
and
she
felt
acutely
that
if
lord
lambeth
s
position
was
heroic
there
was
but
little
of
the
hero
in
the
young
man
himself
then
her
imagination
wandered
away
from
him
very
far
away
for
it
was
an
incontestable
fact
that
at
such
moments
he
seemed
distinctly
dull
i
am
afraid
that
while
bessie
s
imagination
was
thus
invidiously
roaming
she
can
not
have
been
herself
a
very
lively
companion
but
it
may
well
have
been
that
these
occasional
fits
of
indifference
seemed
to
lord
lambeth
a
part
of
the
young
girl
s
personal
charm
it
had
been
a
part
of
this
charm
from
the
first
that
he
felt
that
she
judged
him
and
measured
him
more
freely
and
irresponsibly
more
at
her
ease
and
her
leisure
as
it
were
than
several
young
ladies
with
whom
he
had
been
on
the
whole
about
as
intimate
to
feel
this
and
yet
to
feel
that
she
also
liked
him
was
very
agreeable
to
lord
lambeth
he
fancied
he
had
compassed
that
gratification
so
desirable
to
young
men
of
title
and
fortune
being
liked
for
himself
it
is
true
that
a
cynical
counselor
might
have
whispered
to
him
liked
for
yourself
yes
but
not
so
very
much
he
had
at
any
rate
the
constant
hope
of
being
liked
more
it
may
seem
perhaps
a
trifle
singular
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
bessie
alden
when
he
struck
her
as
dull
devoted
some
time
on
grounds
of
conscience
to
trying
to
like
him
more
i
say
on
grounds
of
conscience
because
she
felt
that
he
had
been
extremely
nice
to
her
sister
and
because
she
reflected
that
it
was
no
more
than
fair
that
she
should
think
as
well
of
him
as
he
thought
of
her
this
effort
was
possibly
sometimes
not
so
successful
as
it
might
have
been
for
the
result
of
it
was
occasionally
a
vague
irritation
which
expressed
itself
in
hostile
criticism
of
several
british
institutions
bessie
alden
went
to
some
entertainments
at
which
she
met
lord
lambeth
but
she
went
to
others
at
which
his
lordship
was
neither
actually
nor
potentially
present
and
it
was
chiefly
on
these
latter
occasions
that
she
encountered
those
literary
and
artistic
celebrities
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
after
a
while
she
reduced
the
matter
to
a
principle
if
lord
lambeth
should
appear
anywhere
it
was
a
symbol
that
there
would
be
no
poets
and
philosophers
and
in
consequence
for
it
was
almost
a
strict
consequence
she
used
to
enumerate
to
the
young
man
these
objects
of
her
admiration
you
seem
to
be
awfully
fond
of
those
sort
of
people
said
lord
lambeth
one
day
as
if
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
they
are
the
people
in
england
i
am
most
curious
to
see
bessie
alden
replied
i
suppose
that
s
because
you
have
read
so
much
said
lord
lambeth
gallantly
i
have
not
read
so
much
it
is
because
we
think
so
much
of
them
at
oh
i
see
observed
the
young
nobleman
in
not
only
in
boston
everywhere
said
bessie
we
hold
them
in
great
honor
they
go
to
the
best
dinner
i
daresay
you
are
right
i
can
t
say
i
know
many
of
it
s
a
pity
you
don
t
bessie
alden
declared
it
would
do
you
i
daresay
it
would
said
lord
lambeth
very
humbly
but
i
must
say
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
some
of
neither
do
i
of
some
of
them
but
there
are
all
kinds
and
many
of
them
are
i
have
talked
with
two
or
three
of
them
the
young
man
went
on
and
i
thought
they
had
a
kind
of
fawning
why
should
they
fawn
bessie
alden
demanded
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
why
indeed
perhaps
you
only
thought
so
said
bessie
well
of
course
rejoined
her
companion
that
s
a
kind
of
thing
that
can
t
be
in
america
they
don
t
fawn
said
bessie
ah
well
then
they
must
be
better
bessie
was
silent
a
moment
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
don
t
like
about
england
she
said
your
keeping
the
distinguished
people
how
do
you
mean
apart
why
letting
them
come
only
to
certain
places
you
never
see
lord
lambeth
looked
at
her
a
moment
what
people
do
you
mean
the
eminent
people
the
authors
and
artists
the
clever
oh
there
are
other
eminent
people
besides
those
said
lord
lambeth
well
you
certainly
keep
them
apart
repeated
the
young
girl
and
there
are
other
clever
people
added
lord
lambeth
simply
bessie
alden
looked
at
him
and
she
gave
a
light
laugh
not
many
she
said
on
another
occasion
just
after
a
dinner
party
she
told
him
that
there
was
something
else
in
england
she
did
not
like
oh
i
say
he
cried
haven
t
you
abused
us
enough
i
have
never
abused
you
at
all
said
bessie
but
i
don
t
like
your
it
isn
t
my
precedence
lord
lambeth
declared
laughing
yes
it
is
yours
just
exactly
yours
and
i
think
it
s
odious
said
bessie
i
never
saw
such
a
young
lady
for
discussing
things
has
someone
had
the
impudence
to
go
before
you
asked
his
lordship
it
is
not
the
going
before
me
that
i
object
to
said
bessie
it
is
their
thinking
that
they
have
a
right
to
do
it
a
right
that
i
i
never
saw
such
a
young
lady
as
you
are
for
not
i
have
no
doubt
the
thing
is
beastly
but
it
saves
a
lot
of
it
makes
a
lot
of
trouble
it
s
horrid
said
bessie
but
how
would
you
have
the
first
people
go
asked
lord
lambeth
they
can
t
go
whom
do
you
mean
by
the
first
people
ah
if
you
mean
to
question
first
principles
said
lord
lambeth
if
those
are
your
first
principles
no
wonder
some
of
your
arrangements
are
horrid
observed
bessie
alden
with
a
very
pretty
ferocity
i
am
a
young
girl
so
of
course
i
go
last
but
imagine
what
kitty
must
feel
on
being
informed
that
she
is
not
at
liberty
to
budge
until
certain
other
ladies
have
passed
oh
i
say
she
is
not
informed
cried
lord
lambeth
no
one
would
do
such
a
thing
as
she
is
made
to
feel
it
the
young
girl
insisted
as
if
they
were
afraid
she
would
make
a
rush
for
the
door
no
you
have
a
lovely
country
said
bessie
alden
but
your
precedence
is
i
certainly
shouldn
t
think
your
sister
would
like
it
rejoined
lord
lambeth
with
even
exaggerated
gravity
but
bessie
alden
could
induce
him
to
enter
no
formal
protest
against
this
repulsive
custom
which
he
seemed
to
think
an
extreme
convenience
percy
beaumont
all
this
time
had
been
a
very
much
less
frequent
visitor
at
jones
s
hotel
than
his
noble
kinsman
he
had
in
fact
called
but
twice
upon
the
two
american
ladies
lord
lambeth
who
often
saw
him
reproached
him
with
his
neglect
and
declared
that
although
westgate
had
said
nothing
about
it
he
was
sure
that
she
was
secretly
wounded
by
it
she
suffers
too
much
to
speak
said
lord
lambeth
that
s
all
gammon
said
percy
beaumont
there
s
a
limit
to
what
people
can
suffer
and
though
sending
no
apologies
to
jones
s
hotel
he
undertook
in
a
manner
to
explain
his
absence
you
are
always
there
he
said
and
that
s
reason
enough
for
my
not
i
don
t
see
why
there
is
enough
for
both
of
i
don
t
care
to
be
a
witness
of
your
your
reckless
passion
said
percy
beaumont
lord
lambeth
looked
at
him
with
a
cold
eye
and
for
a
moment
said
nothing
it
s
not
so
obvious
as
you
might
suppose
he
rejoined
dryly
considering
what
a
demonstrative
beggar
i
i
don
t
want
to
know
anything
about
it
nothing
whatever
said
beaumont
your
mother
asks
me
everytime
she
sees
me
whether
i
believe
you
are
really
lost
and
lady
pimlico
does
the
same
i
prefer
to
be
able
to
answer
that
i
know
nothing
about
it
that
i
never
go
there
i
stay
away
for
consistency
s
sake
as
i
said
the
other
day
they
must
look
after
you
you
are
devilish
considerate
said
lord
lambeth
they
never
question
they
are
afraid
of
you
they
are
afraid
of
irritating
you
and
making
you
worse
so
they
go
to
work
very
cautiously
and
somewhere
or
other
they
get
their
information
they
know
a
great
deal
about
you
they
know
that
you
have
been
with
those
ladies
to
the
dome
of
paul
s
and
where
was
the
other
place
to
the
thames
if
all
their
knowledge
is
as
accurate
as
that
it
must
be
very
valuable
said
lord
lambeth
well
at
any
rate
they
know
that
you
have
been
visiting
the
sights
of
the
they
think
very
naturally
as
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
take
to
visiting
the
sights
of
the
metropolis
with
a
little
american
girl
there
is
serious
cause
for
lord
lambeth
responded
to
this
intimation
by
scornful
laughter
and
his
companion
continued
after
a
pause
i
said
just
now
i
didn
t
want
to
know
anything
about
the
affair
but
i
will
confess
that
i
am
curious
to
learn
whether
you
propose
to
marry
miss
bessie
on
this
point
lord
lambeth
gave
his
interlocutor
no
immediate
satisfaction
he
was
musing
with
a
frown
by
jove
he
said
they
go
rather
too
far
they
shall
find
me
dangerous
i
promise
percy
beaumont
began
to
laugh
you
don
t
redeem
your
promises
you
said
the
other
day
you
would
make
your
mother
lord
lambeth
continued
to
meditate
i
asked
her
to
call
he
said
simply
and
she
declined
yes
but
she
shall
do
it
upon
my
word
said
percy
beaumont
if
she
gets
much
more
frightened
i
believe
she
lord
lambeth
looked
at
him
and
he
went
on
she
will
go
to
the
girl
how
do
you
mean
she
will
go
to
her
she
will
beg
her
off
or
she
will
bribe
her
she
will
take
strong
lord
lambeth
turned
away
in
silence
and
his
companion
watched
him
take
twenty
steps
and
then
slowly
return
i
have
invited
westgate
and
miss
alden
to
branches
he
said
and
this
evening
i
shall
name
a
and
shall
you
invite
your
mother
and
your
sisters
to
meet
them
explicitly
that
will
set
the
duchess
off
said
percy
beaumont
i
suspect
she
will
she
may
do
as
she
beaumont
looked
at
lord
lambeth
you
do
really
propose
to
marry
the
little
sister
then
i
like
the
way
you
talk
about
it
cried
the
young
man
she
won
t
gobble
me
down
don
t
be
she
won
t
leave
you
on
your
knees
said
percy
beaumont
what
is
the
inducement
you
talk
about
proposing
wait
till
i
have
proposed
lord
lambeth
went
on
that
s
right
my
dear
fellow
think
about
it
said
percy
beaumont
she
s
a
charming
girl
pursued
his
lordship
of
course
she
s
a
charming
girl
i
don
t
know
a
girl
more
charming
intrinsically
but
there
are
other
charming
girls
nearer
i
like
her
spirit
observed
lord
lambeth
almost
as
if
he
were
trying
to
torment
his
cousin
what
s
the
peculiarity
of
her
spirit
she
s
not
afraid
and
she
says
things
out
and
she
thinks
herself
as
good
as
anyone
she
is
the
only
girl
i
have
ever
seen
that
was
not
dying
to
marry
how
do
you
know
that
if
you
haven
t
asked
her
i
don
t
know
how
but
i
know
i
am
sure
she
asked
me
questions
enough
about
your
property
and
your
titles
said
beaumont
she
has
asked
me
questions
too
no
end
of
them
lord
lambeth
admitted
but
she
asked
for
information
don
t
you
information
aye
i
ll
warrant
she
wanted
it
depend
upon
it
that
she
is
dying
to
marry
you
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
as
all
the
rest
of
i
shouldn
t
like
her
to
refuse
me
i
shouldn
t
like
if
the
thing
would
be
so
disagreeable
then
both
to
you
and
to
her
in
heaven
s
name
leave
it
alone
said
percy
beaumont
westgate
on
her
side
had
plenty
to
say
to
her
sister
about
the
rarity
of
beaumont
s
visits
and
the
nonappearance
of
the
duchess
of
bayswater
she
professed
however
to
derive
more
satisfaction
from
this
latter
circumstance
than
she
could
have
done
from
the
most
lavish
attentions
on
the
part
of
this
great
lady
it
is
most
marked
she
said
most
marked
it
is
a
delicious
proof
that
we
have
made
them
miserable
the
day
we
dined
with
lord
lambeth
i
was
really
sorry
for
the
poor
it
will
have
been
gathered
that
the
entertainment
offered
by
lord
lambeth
to
his
american
friends
had
not
been
graced
by
the
presence
of
his
anxious
mother
he
had
invited
several
choice
spirits
to
meet
them
but
the
ladies
of
his
immediate
family
were
to
westgate
s
sense
a
sense
possibly
morbidly
acute
conspicuous
by
their
absence
i
don
t
want
to
express
myself
in
a
manner
that
you
dislike
said
bessie
alden
but
i
don
t
know
why
you
should
have
so
many
theories
about
lord
lambeth
s
poor
mother
you
know
a
great
many
young
men
in
new
york
without
knowing
their
westgate
looked
at
her
sister
and
then
turned
away
my
dear
bessie
you
are
superb
she
said
one
thing
is
certain
the
young
girl
continued
if
i
believed
i
were
a
cause
of
annoyance
however
unwitting
to
lord
lambeth
s
family
i
should
insist
insist
upon
my
leaving
england
said
westgate
no
not
that
i
want
to
go
to
the
national
gallery
again
i
want
to
see
and
canterbury
cathedral
but
i
should
insist
upon
his
coming
to
see
us
no
that
would
be
very
modest
and
very
pretty
of
you
but
you
wouldn
t
do
it
why
do
you
say
now
asked
bessie
alden
have
i
ceased
to
be
modest
you
care
for
him
too
much
a
month
ago
when
you
said
you
didn
t
i
believe
it
was
quite
true
but
at
present
my
dear
child
said
westgate
you
wouldn
t
find
it
quite
so
simple
a
matter
never
to
see
lord
lambeth
again
i
have
seen
it
coming
you
are
mistaken
said
bessie
you
don
t
my
dear
child
don
t
be
perverse
rejoined
her
sister
i
know
him
better
certainly
if
you
mean
that
said
bessie
and
i
like
him
very
much
but
i
don
t
like
him
enough
to
make
trouble
for
him
with
his
family
however
i
don
t
believe
in
i
like
the
way
you
say
however
westgate
exclaimed
come
you
would
not
marry
him
oh
no
said
the
young
girl
westgate
for
a
moment
seemed
vexed
why
not
pray
she
demanded
because
i
don
t
care
to
said
bessie
alden
the
morning
after
lord
lambeth
had
had
with
percy
beaumont
that
exchange
of
ideas
which
has
just
been
narrated
the
ladies
at
jones
s
hotel
received
from
his
lordship
a
written
invitation
to
pay
their
projected
visit
to
branches
castle
on
the
following
tuesday
i
think
i
have
made
up
a
very
pleasant
party
the
young
nobleman
said
several
people
whom
you
know
and
my
mother
and
sisters
who
have
so
long
been
regrettably
prevented
from
making
your
bessie
alden
lost
no
time
in
calling
her
sister
s
attention
to
the
injustice
she
had
done
the
duchess
of
bayswater
whose
hostility
was
now
proved
to
be
a
vain
illusion
wait
till
you
see
if
she
comes
said
westgate
and
if
she
is
to
meet
us
at
her
son
s
house
the
obligation
was
all
the
greater
for
her
to
call
upon
bessie
had
not
to
wait
long
and
it
appeared
that
lord
lambeth
s
mother
now
accepted
westgate
s
view
of
her
duties
on
the
morrow
early
in
the
afternoon
two
cards
were
brought
to
the
apartment
of
the
american
ladies
one
of
them
bearing
the
name
of
the
duchess
of
bayswater
and
the
other
that
of
the
countess
of
pimlico
westgate
glanced
at
the
clock
it
is
not
yet
four
she
said
they
have
come
early
they
wish
to
see
us
we
will
receive
and
she
gave
orders
that
her
visitors
should
be
admitted
a
few
moments
later
they
were
introduced
and
there
was
a
solemn
exchange
of
amenities
the
duchess
was
a
large
lady
with
a
fine
fresh
color
the
countess
of
pimlico
was
very
pretty
and
elegant
the
duchess
looked
about
her
as
she
sat
down
looked
not
especially
at
westgate
i
daresay
my
son
has
told
you
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
come
and
see
you
she
observed
you
are
very
kind
said
westgate
vaguely
her
conscience
not
allowing
her
to
assent
to
this
proposition
and
indeed
not
permitting
her
to
enunciate
her
own
with
any
appreciable
emphasis
he
says
you
were
so
kind
to
him
in
america
said
the
duchess
we
are
very
glad
westgate
replied
to
have
been
able
to
make
him
a
little
more
a
little
less
a
little
more
i
think
he
stayed
at
your
house
remarked
the
duchess
of
bayswater
looking
at
bessie
alden
a
very
short
time
said
westgate
oh
said
the
duchess
and
she
continued
to
look
at
bessie
who
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
her
daughter
do
you
like
london
lady
pimlico
had
asked
of
bessie
after
looking
at
her
a
good
deal
at
her
face
and
her
hands
her
dress
and
her
hair
very
much
indeed
said
bessie
do
you
like
this
hotel
it
is
very
comfortable
said
bessie
do
you
like
stopping
at
hotels
inquired
lady
pimlico
after
a
pause
i
am
very
fond
of
traveling
bessie
answered
and
i
suppose
hotels
are
a
necessary
part
of
it
but
they
are
not
the
part
i
am
fondest
oh
i
hate
traveling
said
the
countess
of
pimlico
and
transferred
her
attention
to
westgate
my
son
tells
me
you
are
going
to
branches
the
duchess
presently
resumed
lord
lambeth
has
been
so
good
as
to
ask
us
said
westgate
who
perceived
that
her
visitor
had
now
begun
to
look
at
her
and
who
had
her
customary
happy
consciousness
of
a
distinguished
appearance
the
only
mitigation
of
her
felicity
on
this
point
was
that
having
inspected
her
visitor
s
own
costume
she
said
to
herself
she
won
t
know
how
well
i
am
dressed
he
has
asked
me
to
go
but
i
am
not
sure
i
shall
be
able
murmured
the
duchess
he
had
offered
us
the
p
prospect
of
meeting
you
said
westgate
i
hate
the
country
at
this
season
responded
the
duchess
westgate
gave
a
little
shrug
i
think
it
is
pleasanter
than
but
the
duchess
s
eyes
were
absent
again
she
was
looking
very
fixedly
at
bessie
in
a
moment
she
slowly
rose
walked
to
a
chair
that
stood
empty
at
the
young
girl
s
right
hand
and
silently
seated
herself
as
she
was
a
majestic
voluminous
woman
this
little
transaction
had
inevitably
an
air
of
somewhat
impressive
intention
it
diffused
a
certain
awkwardness
which
lady
pimlico
as
a
sympathetic
daughter
perhaps
desired
to
rectify
in
turning
to
westgate
i
daresay
you
go
out
a
great
deal
she
observed
no
very
little
we
are
strangers
and
we
didn
t
come
here
for
i
see
said
lady
pimlico
it
s
rather
nice
in
town
just
it
s
charming
said
westgate
but
we
only
go
to
see
a
few
people
whom
we
of
course
one
can
t
like
everyone
said
lady
pimlico
it
depends
upon
one
s
society
westgate
rejoined
the
duchess
meanwhile
had
addressed
herself
to
bessie
my
son
tells
me
the
young
ladies
in
america
are
so
i
am
glad
they
made
so
good
an
impression
on
him
said
bessie
smiling
the
duchess
was
not
smiling
her
large
fresh
face
was
very
tranquil
he
is
very
susceptible
she
said
he
thinks
everyone
clever
and
sometimes
they
sometimes
bessie
assented
smiling
still
the
duchess
looked
at
her
a
little
and
then
went
on
lambeth
is
very
susceptible
but
he
is
very
volatile
volatile
asked
bessie
he
is
very
inconstant
it
won
t
do
to
depend
on
ah
said
bessie
i
don
t
recognize
that
description
we
have
depended
on
him
greatly
my
sister
and
i
and
he
has
never
disappointed
he
will
disappoint
you
yet
said
the
duchess
bessie
gave
a
little
laugh
as
if
she
were
amused
at
the
duchess
s
persistency
i
suppose
it
will
depend
on
what
we
expect
of
the
less
you
expect
the
better
lord
lambeth
s
mother
declared
well
said
bessie
we
expect
nothing
the
duchess
for
a
moment
was
silent
though
she
appeared
to
have
more
to
say
lambeth
says
he
has
seen
so
much
of
you
she
presently
began
he
has
been
to
see
us
very
often
he
has
been
very
kind
said
bessie
alden
i
daresay
you
are
used
to
that
i
am
told
there
is
a
great
deal
of
that
in
a
great
deal
of
kindness
the
young
girl
inquired
smiling
is
that
what
you
call
it
i
know
you
have
different
we
certainly
don
t
always
understand
each
other
said
westgate
the
termination
of
whose
interview
with
lady
pimlico
allowed
her
to
give
her
attention
to
their
elder
visitor
i
am
speaking
of
the
young
men
calling
so
much
upon
the
young
ladies
the
duchess
explained
but
surely
in
england
said
westgate
the
young
ladies
don
t
call
upon
the
young
men
some
of
them
do
almost
lady
pimlico
declared
when
the
young
men
are
a
great
bessie
you
must
make
a
note
of
that
said
westgate
my
sister
she
added
is
a
model
traveler
she
writes
down
all
the
curious
facts
she
hears
in
a
little
book
she
keeps
for
the
the
duchess
was
a
little
flushed
she
looked
all
about
the
room
while
her
daughter
turned
to
bessie
my
brother
told
us
you
were
wonderfully
clever
said
lady
pimlico
he
should
have
said
my
sister
bessie
answered
when
she
says
such
things
as
shall
you
be
long
at
branches
the
duchess
asked
abruptly
of
the
young
girl
lord
lambeth
has
asked
us
for
three
days
said
bessie
i
shall
go
the
duchess
declared
and
my
daughter
that
will
be
charming
bessie
rejoined
delightful
murmured
westgate
i
shall
expect
to
see
a
great
deal
of
you
the
duchess
continued
when
i
go
to
branches
i
monopolize
my
son
s
they
must
be
most
happy
said
westgate
very
graciously
i
want
immensely
to
see
it
to
see
the
castle
said
bessie
to
the
duchess
i
have
never
seen
one
in
england
at
least
and
you
know
we
have
none
in
ah
you
are
fond
of
castles
inquired
her
grace
immensely
replied
the
young
girl
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
to
live
in
the
duchess
looked
at
her
a
moment
as
if
she
hardly
knew
how
to
take
this
assurance
which
from
her
grace
s
point
of
view
was
either
very
artless
or
very
audacious
well
she
said
rising
i
will
show
you
branches
and
upon
this
the
two
great
ladies
took
their
departure
what
did
they
mean
by
it
asked
westgate
when
they
were
gone
they
meant
to
be
polite
said
bessie
because
we
are
going
to
meet
it
is
too
late
to
be
polite
westgate
replied
almost
grimly
they
meant
to
overawe
us
by
their
fine
manners
and
their
grandeur
and
to
make
you
lacher
lacher
prise
what
strange
things
you
say
murmured
bessie
alden
they
meant
to
snub
us
so
that
we
shouldn
t
dare
to
go
to
branches
westgate
continued
on
the
contrary
said
bessie
the
duchess
offered
to
show
me
the
place
yes
you
may
depend
upon
it
she
won
t
let
you
out
of
her
sight
she
will
show
you
the
place
from
morning
till
you
have
a
theory
for
everything
said
bessie
and
you
apparently
have
none
for
i
saw
no
attempt
to
overawe
us
said
the
young
girl
their
manners
were
not
they
were
not
even
good
westgate
declared
bessie
was
silent
a
while
but
in
a
few
moments
she
observed
that
she
had
a
very
good
theory
they
came
to
look
at
me
she
said
as
if
this
had
been
a
very
ingenious
hypothesis
westgate
did
it
justice
she
greeted
it
with
a
smile
and
pronounced
it
most
brilliant
while
in
reality
she
felt
that
the
young
girl
s
skepticism
or
her
charity
or
as
she
had
sometimes
called
it
appropriately
her
idealism
was
proof
against
irony
bessie
however
remained
meditative
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
well
on
into
the
morrow
on
the
morrow
before
lunch
westgate
had
occasion
to
go
out
for
an
hour
and
left
her
sister
writing
a
letter
when
she
came
back
she
met
lord
lambeth
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
coming
away
she
thought
he
looked
slightly
embarrassed
he
was
certainly
very
grave
i
am
sorry
to
have
missed
you
won
t
you
come
back
she
asked
no
said
the
young
man
i
can
t
i
have
seen
your
sister
i
can
never
come
then
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
took
her
hand
goodbye
westgate
he
said
you
have
been
very
kind
to
and
with
what
she
thought
a
strange
sad
look
in
his
handsome
young
face
he
turned
away
she
went
in
and
she
found
bessie
still
writing
her
letter
that
is
westgate
perceived
she
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
and
not
writing
lord
lambeth
has
been
here
said
the
elder
lady
at
last
then
bessie
got
up
and
showed
her
a
pale
serious
face
she
bent
this
face
upon
her
sister
for
some
time
confessing
silently
and
a
little
pleading
i
told
him
she
said
at
last
that
we
could
not
go
to
westgate
displayed
just
a
spark
of
irritation
he
might
have
waited
she
said
with
a
smile
till
one
had
seen
the
later
an
hour
afterward
she
said
dear
bessie
i
wish
you
might
have
accepted
i
couldn
t
said
bessie
gently
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
said
westgate
i
couldn
t
bessie
repeated
if
it
is
only
her
sister
added
because
those
women
will
think
that
they
succeeded
that
they
paralyzed
us

alden
turned
away
but
presently
she
added
they
were
interesting
i
should
have
liked
to
see
them
so

i
cried
westgate
significantly
and
i
should
have
liked
to
see

castle
said
bessie
but
now
we
must
leave
england

added

sister
looked
at
her
you

not

to

to
the
national
gallery

reflected
a
moment
we
can
stop
there
on
our
way
to
paris
she
said
lord
lambeth
did
not
tell
percy
beaumont
that
the
contingency
he
was
not
prepared
at
all
to
like
had
occurred
but
percy
beaumont
on
hearing
that
the
two
ladies
had
left
london
wondered
with
some
intensity
what
had
happened
wondered
that
is
until
the
duchess
of
bayswater
came
a
little
to
his
assistance
the
two
ladies
went
to
paris
and
westgate
beguiled
the
journey
to
that
city
by
repeating
several
times
that
s
what
i
regret
they
will
think
they
petrified
but
bessie
alden
seemed
to
regret
nothing
