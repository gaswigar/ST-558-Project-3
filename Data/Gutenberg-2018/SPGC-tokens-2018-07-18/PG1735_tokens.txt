sophist
by
plato
translated

jowett
introduction
and
analysis
the
dramatic
power
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
appears
to
diminish
as
the
metaphysical
interest
of
them
increases
compare
introd
to
the
philebus
there
are
no
descriptions
of
time
place
or
persons
in
the
sophist
and
statesman
but
we
are
plunged
at
once
into
philosophical
discussions
the
poetical
charm
has
disappeared
and
those
who
have
no
taste
for
abstruse
metaphysics
will
greatly
prefer
the
earlier
dialogues
to
the
later
ones
plato
is
conscious
of
the
change
and
in
the
statesman
expressly
accuses
himself
of
a
tediousness
in
the
two
dialogues
which
he
ascribes
to
his
desire
of
developing
the
dialectical
method
on
the
other
hand
the
kindred
spirit
of
hegel
seemed
to
find
in
the
sophist
the
crown
and
summit
of
the
platonic
philosophy
here
is
the
place
at
which
plato
most
nearly
approaches
to
the
hegelian
identity
of
being
and
nor
will
the
great
importance
of
the
two
dialogues
be
doubted
by
any
one
who
forms
a
conception
of
the
state
of
mind
and
opinion
which
they
are
intended
to
meet
the
sophisms
of
the
day
were
undermining
philosophy
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
and
of
the
connexion
of
ideas
was
making
truth
and
falsehood
equally
impossible
it
has
been
said
that
plato
would
have
written
differently
if
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
organon
of
aristotle
but
could
the
organon
of
aristotle
ever
have
been
written
unless
the
sophist
and
statesman
had
preceded
the
swarm
of
fallacies
which
arose
in
the
infancy
of
mental
science
and
which
was
born
and
bred
in
the
decay
of
the
philosophies
was
not
dispelled
by
aristotle
but
by
socrates
and
plato
the
summa
genera
of
thought
the
nature
of
the
proposition
of
definition
of
generalization
of
synthesis
and
analysis
of
division
and
are
clearly
described
and
the
processes
of
induction
and
deduction
are
constantly
employed
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
the
nature
of
comparison
the
danger
of
putting
words
in
the
place
of
things
the
fallacy
of
arguing
dicto
secundum
and
in
a
circle
are
frequently
indicated
by
him
to
all
these
processes
of
truth
and
error
aristotle
in
the
next
generation
gave
distinctness
he
brought
them
together
in
a
separate
science
but
he
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
the
original
inventor
of
any
of
the
great
logical
forms
with
the
exception
of
the
syllogism
there
is
little
worthy
of
remark
in
the
characters
of
the
sophist
the
most
noticeable
point
is
the
final
retirement
of
socrates
from
the
field
of
argument
and
the
substitution
for
him
of
an
eleatic
stranger
who
is
described
as
a
pupil
of
parmenides
and
zeno
and
is
supposed
to
have
descended
from
a
higher
world
in
order
to
convict
the
socratic
circle
of
error
as
in
the
timaeus
plato
seems
to
intimate
by
the
withdrawal
of
socrates
that
he
is
passing
beyond
the
limits
of
his
teaching
and
in
the
sophist
and
statesman
as
well
as
in
the
parmenides
he
probably
means
to
imply
that
he
is
making
a
closer
approach
to
the
schools
of
elea
and
megara
he
had
much
in
common
with
them
but
he
must
first
submit
their
ideas
to
criticism
and
revision
he
had
once
thought
as
he
says
speaking
by
the
mouth
of
the
eleatic
that
he
understood
their
doctrine
of
but
now
he
does
not
even
comprehend
the
nature
of
being
the
friends
of
ideas
soph
are
alluded
to
by
him
as
distant
acquaintances
whom
he
criticizes
ab
extra
we
do
not
recognize
at
first
sight
that
he
is
criticizing
himself
the
character
of
the
eleatic
stranger
is
colourless
he
is
to
a
certain
extent
the
reflection
of
his
father
and
master
parmenides
who
is
the
protagonist
in
the
dialogue
which
is
called
by
his
name
theaetetus
himself
is
not
distinguished
by
the
remarkable
traits
which
are
attributed
to
him
in
the
preceding
dialogue
he
is
no
longer
under
the
spell
of
socrates
or
subject
to
the
operation
of
his
midwifery
though
the
fiction
of
question
and
answer
is
still
maintained
and
the
necessity
of
taking
theaetetus
along
with
him
is
several
times
insisted
upon
by
his
partner
in
the
discussion
there
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
old
theaetetus
in
his
remark
that
he
will
not
tire
of
the
argument
and
in
his
conviction
which
the
eleatic
thinks
likely
to
be
permanent
that
the
course
of
events
is
governed
by
the
will
of
god
throughout
the
two
dialogues
socrates
continues
a
silent
auditor
in
the
statesman
just
reminding
us
of
his
presence
at
the
commencement
by
a
characteristic
jest
about
the
statesman
and
the
philosopher
and
by
an
allusion
to
his
namesake
with
whom
on
that
ground
he
claims
relationship
as
he
had
already
claimed
an
affinity
with
theaetetus
grounded
on
the
likeness
of
his
ugly
face
but
in
neither
dialogue
any
more
than
in
the
timaeus
does
he
offer
any
criticism
on
the
views
which
are
propounded
by
another
the
style
though
wanting
in
dramatic
power
in
this
respect
resembling
the
philebus
and
the
laws
is
very
clear
and
accurate
and
has
several
touches
of
humour
and
satire
the
language
is
less
fanciful
and
imaginative
than
that
of
the
earlier
dialogues
and
there
is
more
of
bitterness
as
in
the
laws
though
traces
of
a
similar
temper
may
also
be
observed
in
the
description
of
the
brute
in
the
republic
and
in
the
contrast
of
the
lawyer
and
philosopher
in
the
theaetetus
the
following
are
characteristic
passages
ancient
philosophers
of
whom
we
may
say
without
offence
that
they
went
on
their
way
rather
regardless
of
whether
we
understood
them
or
not
the
picture
of
the
materialists
or
giants
grasped
oaks
and
rocks
in
their
hands
and
who
must
be
improved
before
they
can
be
reasoned
with
and
the
equally
humourous
delineation
of
the
friends
of
ideas
who
defend
themselves
from
a
fastness
in
the
invisible
world
or
the
comparison
of
the
sophist
to
a
painter
or
maker
compare
republic
and
the
hunt
after
him
in
the
rich
of
youth
and
wealth
or
again
the
light
and
graceful
touch
with
which
the
older
philosophies
are
painted
and
sicilian
muses
the
comparison
of
them
to
mythological
tales
and
the
fear
of
the
eleatic
that
he
will
be
counted
a
parricide
if
he
ventures
to
lay
hands
on
his
father
parmenides
or
once
more
the
likening
of
the
eleatic
stranger
to
a
god
from
all
these
passages
notwithstanding
the
decline
of
the
style
retain
the
impress
of
the
great
master
of
language
but
the
equably
diffused
grace
is
gone
instead
of
the
endless
variety
of
the
early
dialogues
traces
of
the
rhythmical
monotonous
cadence
of
the
laws
begin
to
appear
and
already
an
approach
is
made
to
the
technical
language
of
aristotle
in
the
frequent
use
of
the
words
and
the
like
the
sophist
like
the
phaedrus
has
a
double
character
and
unites
two
enquirers
which
are
only
in
a
somewhat
forced
manner
connected
with
each
other
the
first
is
the
search
after
the
sophist
the
second
is
the
enquiry
into
the
nature
of
which
occupies
the
middle
part
of
the
work
for
is
the
hole
or
division
of
the
dialectical
net
in
which
the
sophist
has
hidden
himself
he
is
the
imaginary
impersonation
of
false
opinion
yet
he
denies
the
possibility
of
false
opinion
for
falsehood
is
that
which
is
not
and
therefore
has
no
existence
at
length
the
difficulty
is
solved
the
answer
in
the
language
of
the
republic
appears
out
at
our
feet
acknowledging
that
there
is
a
communion
of
kinds
with
kinds
and
not
merely
one
being
or
good
having
different
names
or
several
isolated
ideas
or
classes
incapable
of
communion
we
discover
to
be
the
other
of
transferring
this
to
language
and
thought
we
have
no
difficulty
in
apprehending
that
a
proposition
may
be
false
as
well
as
true
the
sophist
drawn
out
of
the
shelter
which
cynic
and
megarian
paradoxes
have
temporarily
afforded
him
is
proved
to
be
a
dissembler
and
juggler
with
words
the
chief
points
of
interest
in
the
dialogue
are
i
the
character
attributed
to
the
sophist
ii
the
dialectical
method
iii
the
nature
of
the
puzzle
about
iv
the
battle
of
the
philosophers
v
the
relation
of
the
sophist
to
other
dialogues
i
the
sophist
in
plato
is
the
master
of
the
art
of
illusion
the
charlatan
the
foreigner
the
prince
of
the
hireling
who
is
not
a
teacher
and
who
from
whatever
point
of
view
he
is
regarded
is
the
opposite
of
the
true
teacher
he
is
the
one
the
ideal
representative
of
all
that
plato
most
disliked
in
the
moral
and
intellectual
tendencies
of
his
own
age
the
adversary
of
the
almost
equally
ideal
socrates
he
seems
to
be
always
growing
in
the
fancy
of
plato
now
boastful
now
eristic
now
clothing
himself
in
rags
of
philosophy
now
more
akin
to
the
rhetorician
or
lawyer
now
haranguing
now
questioning
until
the
final
appearance
in
the
politicus
of
his
departing
shadow
in
the
disguise
of
a
statesman
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
plato
intended
by
such
a
description
to
depict
protagoras
or
gorgias
or
even
thrasymachus
who
all
turn
out
to
be
good
sort
of
people
when
we
know
them
and
all
of
them
part
on
good
terms
with
socrates
but
he
is
speaking
of
a
being
as
imaginary
as
the
wise
man
of
the
stoics
and
whose
character
varies
in
different
dialogues
like
mythology
greek
philosophy
has
a
tendency
to
personify
ideas
and
the
sophist
is
not
merely
a
teacher
of
rhetoric
for
a
fee
of
one
or
fifty
drachmae
crat
but
an
ideal
of
plato
in
which
the
falsehood
of
all
mankind
is
reflected
a
milder
tone
is
adopted
towards
the
sophists
in
a
passage
of
the
republic
where
they
are
described
as
the
followers
rather
than
the
leaders
of
the
rest
of
mankind
plato
ridicules
the
notion
that
any
individuals
can
corrupt
youth
to
a
degree
worth
speaking
of
in
comparison
with
the
greater
influence
of
public
opinion
but
there
is
no
real
inconsistency
between
this
and
other
descriptions
of
the
sophist
which
occur
in
the
platonic
writings
for
plato
is
not
justifying
the
sophists
in
the
passage
just
quoted
but
only
representing
their
power
to
be
contemptible
they
are
to
be
despised
rather
than
feared
and
are
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
mankind
but
a
teacher
or
statesman
may
be
justly
condemned
who
is
on
a
level
with
mankind
when
he
ought
to
be
above
them
there
is
another
point
of
view
in
which
this
passage
should
also
be
considered
the
great
enemy
of
plato
is
the
world
not
exactly
in
the
theological
sense
yet
in
one
not
wholly
different
the
world
as
the
hater
of
truth
and
lover
of
appearance
occupied
in
the
pursuit
of
gain
and
pleasure
rather
than
of
knowledge
banded
together
against
the
few
good
and
wise
men
and
devoid
of
true
education
this
creature
has
many
heads
rhetoricians
lawyers
statesmen
poets
sophists
but
the
sophist
is
the
proteus
who
takes
the
likeness
of
all
of
them
all
other
deceivers
have
a
piece
of
him
in
them
and
sometimes
he
is
represented
as
the
corrupter
of
the
world
and
sometimes
the
world
as
the
corrupter
of
him
and
of
itself
of
late
years
the
sophists
have
found
an
enthusiastic
defender
in
the
distinguished
historian
of
greece
he
appears
to
maintain
that
the
term
is
not
the
name
of
a
particular
class
and
would
have
been
applied
indifferently
to
socrates
and
plato
as
well
as
to
gorgias
and
protagoras
that
the
bad
sense
was
imprinted
on
the
word
by
the
genius
of
plato
that
the
principal
sophists
were
not
the
corrupters
of
youth
for
the
athenian
youth
were
no
more
corrupted
in
the
age
of
demosthenes
than
in
the
age
of
pericles
but
honourable
and
estimable
persons
who
supplied
a
training
in
literature
which
was
generally
wanted
at
the
time
we
will
briefly
consider
how
far
these
statements
appear
to
be
justified
by
facts
and
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
there
arises
an
interesting
question
many
words
are
used
both
in
a
general
and
a
specific
sense
and
the
two
senses
are
not
always
clearly
distinguished
sometimes
the
generic
meaning
has
been
narrowed
to
the
specific
while
in
other
cases
the
specific
meaning
has
been
enlarged
or
altered
examples
of
the
former
class
are
furnished
by
some
ecclesiastical
terms
apostles
prophets
bishops
elders
catholics
examples
of
the
latter
class
may
also
be
found
in
a
similar
field
jesuits
puritans
methodists
and
the
like
sometimes
the
meaning
is
both
narrowed
and
enlarged
and
a
good
or
bad
sense
will
subsist
side
by
side
with
a
neutral
one
a
curious
effect
is
produced
on
the
meaning
of
a
word
when
the
very
term
which
is
stigmatized
by
the
world
methodists
is
adopted
by
the
obnoxious
or
derided
class
this
tends
to
define
the
meaning
or
again
the
opposite
result
is
produced
when
the
world
refuses
to
allow
some
sect
or
body
of
men
the
possession
of
an
honourable
name
which
they
have
assumed
or
applies
it
to
them
only
in
mockery
or
irony
the
term
is
one
of
those
words
of
which
the
meaning
has
been
both
contracted
and
enlarged
passages
may
be
quoted
from
herodotus
and
the
tragedians
in
which
the
word
is
used
in
a
neutral
sense
for
a
contriver
or
deviser
or
inventor
without
including
any
ethical
idea
of
goodness
or
badness
poets
as
well
as
philosophers
were
called
sophists
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
in
plato
himself
the
term
is
applied
in
the
sense
of
a
in
art
without
any
bad
meaning
attaching
to
it
symp
meno
in
the
later
greek
again
and
became
almost
indistinguishable
there
was
no
reproach
conveyed
by
the
word
the
additional
association
if
any
was
only
that
of
rhetorician
or
teacher
philosophy
had
become
eclecticism
and
imitation
in
the
decline
of
greek
thought
there
was
no
original
voice
lifted
up
reached
to
a
thousand
years
because
of
the
god
hence
the
two
words
like
the
characters
represented
by
them
tended
to
pass
into
one
another
yet
even
here
some
differences
appeared
for
the
term
would
hardly
have
been
applied
to
the
greater
names
such
as
plotinus
and
would
have
been
more
often
used
of
a
professor
of
philosophy
in
general
than
of
a
maintainer
of
particular
tenets
but
the
real
question
is
not
whether
the
word
has
all
these
senses
but
whether
there
is
not
also
a
specific
bad
sense
in
which
the
term
is
applied
to
certain
contemporaries
of
socrates
would
an
athenian
as
grote
supposes
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
have
included
socrates
and
plato
as
well
as
gorgias
and
protagoras
under
the
specific
class
of
sophists
to
this
question
we
must
answer
no
if
ever
the
term
is
applied
to
socrates
and
plato
either
the
application
is
made
by
an
enemy
out
of
mere
spite
or
the
sense
in
which
it
is
used
is
neutral
plato
xenophon
isocrates
aristotle
all
give
a
bad
import
to
the
word
and
the
sophists
are
regarded
as
a
separate
class
in
all
of
them
and
in
later
greek
literature
the
distinction
is
quite
marked
between
the
succession
of
philosophers
from
thales
to
aristotle
and
the
sophists
of
the
age
of
socrates
who
appeared
like
meteors
for
a
short
time
in
different
parts
of
greece
for
the
purposes
of
comedy
socrates
may
have
been
identified
with
the
sophists
and
he
seems
to
complain
of
this
in
the
apology
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
socrates
differing
by
so
many
outward
marks
would
really
have
been
confounded
in
the
mind
of
anytus
or
callicles
or
of
any
intelligent
athenian
with
the
splendid
foreigners
who
from
time
to
time
visited
athens
or
appeared
at
the
olympic
games
the
man
of
genius
the
great
original
thinker
the
disinterested
seeker
after
truth
the
master
of
repartee
whom
no
one
ever
defeated
in
an
argument
was
separated
even
in
the
mind
of
the
vulgar
athenian
by
an
which
no
geometry
can
express
from
the
balancer
of
sentences
the
interpreter
and
reciter
of
the
poets
the
divider
of
the
meanings
of
words
the
teacher
of
rhetoric
the
professor
of
morals
and
manners
the
use
of
the
term
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
also
shows
that
the
bad
sense
was
not
affixed
by
his
genius
but
already
current
when
protagoras
says
confess
that
i
am
a
sophist
he
implies
that
the
art
which
he
professes
has
already
a
bad
name
and
the
words
of
the
young
hippocrates
when
with
a
blush
upon
his
face
which
is
just
seen
by
the
light
of
dawn
he
admits
that
he
is
going
to
be
made
sophist
would
lose
their
point
unless
the
term
had
been
discredited
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
the
sophists
having
an
evil
name
that
whether
deserved
or
not
was
a
natural
consequence
of
their
vocation
that
they
were
foreigners
that
they
made
fortunes
that
they
taught
novelties
that
they
excited
the
minds
of
youth
are
quite
sufficient
reasons
to
account
for
the
opprobrium
which
attached
to
them
the
genius
of
plato
could
not
have
stamped
the
word
anew
or
have
imparted
the
associations
which
occur
in
contemporary
writers
such
as
xenophon
and
isocrates
changes
in
the
meaning
of
words
can
only
be
made
with
great
difficulty
and
not
unless
they
are
supported
by
a
strong
current
of
popular
feeling
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
supposing
that
plato
may
have
extended
and
envenomed
the
meaning
or
that
he
may
have
done
the
sophists
the
same
kind
of
disservice
with
posterity
which
pascal
did
to
the
jesuits
but
the
bad
sense
of
the
word
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
invented
by
him
and
is
found
in
his
earlier
dialogues
the
protagoras
as
well
as
in
the
later
there
is
no
ground
for
disbelieving
that
the
principal
sophists
gorgias
protagoras
prodicus
hippias
were
good
and
honourable
men
the
notion
that
they
were
corrupters
of
the
athenian
youth
has
no
real
foundation
and
partly
arises
out
of
the
use
of
the
term
in
modern
times
the
truth
is
that
we
know
little
about
them
and
the
witness
of
plato
in
their
favour
is
probably
not
much
more
historical
than
his
witness
against
them
of
that
national
decline
of
genius
unity
political
force
which
has
been
sometimes
described
as
the
corruption
of
youth
the
sophists
were
one
among
many
signs
in
these
respects
athens
may
have
degenerated
but
as
grote
remarks
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
any
greater
moral
corruption
in
the
age
of
demosthenes
than
in
the
age
of
pericles
the
athenian
youth
were
not
corrupted
in
this
sense
and
therefore
the
sophists
could
not
have
corrupted
them
it
is
remarkable
and
may
be
fairly
set
down
to
their
credit
that
plato
nowhere
attributes
to
them
that
peculiar
greek
sympathy
with
youth
which
he
ascribes
to
parmenides
and
which
was
evidently
common
in
the
socratic
circle
plato
delights
to
exhibit
them
in
a
ludicrous
point
of
view
and
to
show
them
always
rather
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
company
of
socrates
but
he
has
no
quarrel
with
their
characters
and
does
not
deny
that
they
are
respectable
men
the
sophist
in
the
dialogue
which
is
called
after
him
is
exhibited
in
many
different
lights
and
appears
and
reappears
in
a
variety
of
forms
there
is
some
want
of
the
higher
platonic
art
in
the
eleatic
stranger
eliciting
his
true
character
by
a
labourious
process
of
enquiry
when
he
had
already
admitted
that
he
knew
quite
well
the
difference
between
the
sophist
and
the
philosopher
and
had
often
heard
the
question
discussed
such
an
anticipation
would
hardly
have
occurred
in
the
earlier
dialogues
but
plato
could
not
altogether
give
up
his
socratic
method
of
which
another
trace
may
be
thought
to
be
discerned
in
his
adoption
of
a
common
instance
before
he
proceeds
to
the
greater
matter
in
hand
yet
the
example
is
also
chosen
in
order
to
damage
the
of
men
as
much
as
possible
each
step
in
the
pedigree
of
the
angler
suggests
some
injurious
reflection
about
the
sophist
they
are
both
hunters
after
a
living
prey
nearly
related
to
tyrants
and
thieves
and
the
sophist
is
the
cousin
of
the
parasite
and
flatterer
the
effect
of
this
is
heightened
by
the
accidental
manner
in
which
the
discovery
is
made
as
the
result
of
a
scientific
division
his
descent
in
another
branch
affords
the
opportunity
of
more
comparisons
for
he
is
a
retail
trader
and
his
wares
are
either
imported
or
like
those
of
other
retail
traders
his
art
is
thus
deprived
of
the
character
of
a
liberal
profession
but
the
most
distinguishing
characteristic
of
him
is
that
he
is
a
disputant
and
higgles
over
an
argument
a
feature
of
the
eristic
here
seems
to
blend
with
plato
usual
description
of
the
sophists
who
in
the
early
dialogues
and
in
the
republic
are
frequently
depicted
as
endeavouring
to
save
themselves
from
disputing
with
socrates
by
making
long
orations
in
this
character
he
parts
company
from
the
vain
and
impertinent
talker
in
private
life
who
is
a
loser
of
money
while
he
is
a
maker
of
it
but
there
is
another
general
division
under
which
his
art
may
be
also
supposed
to
fall
and
that
is
purification
and
from
purification
is
descended
education
and
the
new
principle
of
education
is
to
interrogate
men
after
the
manner
of
socrates
and
make
them
teach
themselves
here
again
we
catch
a
glimpse
rather
of
a
socratic
or
eristic
than
of
a
sophist
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
and
plato
does
not
on
this
ground
reject
the
claim
of
the
sophist
to
be
the
true
philosopher
one
more
feature
of
the
eristic
rather
than
of
the
sophist
is
the
tendency
of
the
troublesome
animal
to
run
away
into
the
darkness
of
upon
the
whole
we
detect
in
him
a
sort
of
hybrid
or
double
nature
of
which
except
perhaps
in
the
euthydemus
of
plato
we
find
no
other
trace
in
greek
philosophy
he
combines
the
teacher
of
virtue
with
the
eristic
while
in
his
omniscience
in
his
ignorance
of
himself
in
his
arts
of
deception
and
in
his
habit
of
writing
and
speaking
about
all
things
he
is
still
the
antithesis
of
socrates
and
of
the
true
teacher
ii
the
question
has
been
asked
whether
the
method
of
infinti
by
which
the
sophist
is
taken
is
a
real
and
valuable
logical
process
modern
science
feels
that
this
like
other
processes
of
formal
logic
presents
a
very
inadequate
conception
of
the
actual
complex
procedure
of
the
mind
by
which
scientific
truth
is
detected
and
verified
plato
himself
seems
to
be
aware
that
mere
division
is
an
unsafe
and
uncertain
weapon
first
in
the
statesman
when
he
says
that
we
should
divide
in
the
middle
for
in
that
way
we
are
more
likely
to
attain
species
secondly
in
the
parallel
precept
of
the
philebus
that
we
should
not
pass
from
the
most
general
notions
to
infinity
but
include
all
the
intervening
middle
principles
until
as
he
also
says
in
the
statesman
we
arrive
at
the
infima
species
thirdly
in
the
phaedrus
when
he
says
that
the
dialectician
will
carve
the
limbs
of
truth
without
mangling
them
and
once
more
in
the
statesman
if
we
can
not
bisect
species
we
must
carve
them
as
well
as
we
can
no
better
image
of
nature
or
truth
as
an
organic
whole
can
be
conceived
than
this
so
far
is
plato
from
supposing
that
mere
division
and
subdivision
of
general
notions
will
guide
men
into
all
truth
plato
does
not
really
mean
to
say
that
the
sophist
or
the
statesman
can
be
caught
in
this
way
but
these
divisions
and
subdivisions
were
favourite
logical
exercises
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
while
indulging
his
dialectical
fancy
and
making
a
contribution
to
logical
method
he
delights
also
to
transfix
the
eristic
sophist
with
weapons
borrowed
from
his
own
armoury
as
we
have
already
seen
the
division
gives
him
the
opportunity
of
making
the
most
damaging
reflections
on
the
sophist
and
all
his
kith
and
kin
and
to
exhibit
him
in
the
most
discreditable
light
nor
need
we
seriously
consider
whether
plato
was
right
in
assuming
that
an
animal
so
various
could
not
be
confined
within
the
limits
of
a
single
definition
in
the
infancy
of
logic
men
sought
only
to
obtain
a
definition
of
an
unknown
or
uncertain
term
the
after
reflection
scarcely
occurred
to
them
that
the
word
might
have
several
senses
which
shaded
off
into
one
another
and
were
not
capable
of
being
comprehended
in
a
single
notion
there
is
no
trace
of
this
reflection
in
plato
but
neither
is
there
any
reason
to
think
even
if
the
reflection
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
have
been
deterred
from
carrying
on
the
war
with
weapons
fair
or
unfair
against
the
outlaw
sophist
iii
the
puzzle
about
appears
to
us
to
be
one
of
the
most
unreal
difficulties
of
ancient
philosophy
we
can
not
understand
the
attitude
of
mind
which
could
imagine
that
falsehood
had
no
existence
if
reality
was
denied
to
how
could
such
a
question
arise
at
all
much
less
become
of
serious
importance
the
answer
to
this
and
to
nearly
all
other
difficulties
of
early
greek
philosophy
is
to
be
sought
for
in
the
history
of
ideas
and
the
answer
is
only
unsatisfactory
because
our
knowledge
is
defective
in
the
passage
from
the
world
of
sense
and
imagination
and
common
language
to
that
of
opinion
and
reflection
the
human
mind
was
exposed
to
many
dangers
and
often
no
end
in
wandering
mazes
lost
on
the
other
hand
the
discovery
of
abstractions
was
the
great
source
of
all
mental
improvement
in
after
ages
it
was
the
pushing
aside
of
the
old
the
revelation
of
the
new
but
each
one
of
the
company
of
abstractions
if
we
may
speak
in
the
metaphorical
language
of
plato
became
in
turn
the
tyrant
of
the
mind
the
dominant
idea
which
would
allow
no
other
to
have
a
share
in
the
throne
this
is
especially
true
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
while
the
absoluteness
of
being
was
asserted
in
every
form
of
language
the
sensible
world
and
all
the
phenomena
of
experience
were
comprehended
under
nor
was
any
difficulty
or
perplexity
thus
created
so
long
as
the
mind
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
being
asked
no
more
questions
and
never
thought
of
applying
the
categories
of
being
or
to
mind
or
opinion
or
practical
life
but
the
negative
as
well
as
the
positive
idea
had
sunk
deep
into
the
intellect
of
man
the
effect
of
the
paradoxes
of
zeno
extended
far
beyond
the
eleatic
circle
and
now
an
unforeseen
consequence
began
to
arise
if
the
many
were
not
if
all
things
were
names
of
the
one
and
nothing
could
be
predicated
of
any
other
thing
how
could
truth
be
distinguished
from
falsehood
the
eleatic
philosopher
would
have
replied
that
being
is
alone
true
but
mankind
had
got
beyond
his
barren
abstractions
they
were
beginning
to
analyze
to
classify
to
define
to
ask
what
is
the
nature
of
knowledge
opinion
sensation
still
less
could
they
be
content
with
the
description
which
achilles
gives
in
homer
of
the
man
whom
his
soul
hates
os
chi
eteron
men
keuthe
eni
phresin
allo
de
eipe
for
their
difficulty
was
not
a
practical
but
a
metaphysical
one
and
their
conception
of
falsehood
was
really
impaired
and
weakened
by
a
metaphysical
illusion
the
strength
of
the
illusion
seems
to
lie
in
the
alternative
if
we
once
admit
the
existence
of
being
and
as
two
spheres
which
exclude
each
other
no
being
or
reality
can
be
ascribed
to
and
therefore
not
to
falsehood
which
is
the
image
or
expression
of
falsehood
is
wholly
false
and
to
speak
of
true
falsehood
as
theaetetus
does
theaet
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
fallacy
to
us
is
ridiculous
and
transparent
no
better
than
those
which
plato
satirizes
in
the
euthydemus
it
is
a
confusion
of
falsehood
and
negation
from
which
plato
himself
is
not
entirely
free
instead
of
saying
is
not
in
accordance
with
facts
is
proved
by
experience
to
be
false
and
from
such
examples
forming
a
general
notion
of
falsehood
the
mind
of
the
greek
thinker
was
lost
in
the
mazes
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
and
the
greater
importance
which
plato
attributes
to
this
fallacy
compared
with
others
is
due
to
the
influence
which
the
eleatic
philosophy
exerted
over
him
he
sees
clearly
to
a
certain
extent
but
he
has
not
yet
attained
a
complete
mastery
over
the
ideas
of
his
predecessors
they
are
still
ends
to
him
and
not
mere
instruments
of
thought
they
are
too
to
be
harmonized
in
a
single
structure
and
may
be
compared
to
rocks
which
project
or
overhang
in
some
ancient
city
walls
there
are
many
such
imperfect
syncretisms
or
eclecticisms
in
the
history
of
philosophy
a
modern
philosopher
though
emancipated
from
scholastic
notions
of
essence
or
substance
might
still
be
seriously
affected
by
the
abstract
idea
of
necessity
or
though
accustomed
like
bacon
to
criticize
abstract
notions
might
not
extend
his
criticism
to
the
syllogism
the
saying
or
thinking
the
thing
that
is
not
would
be
the
popular
definition
of
falsehood
or
error
if
we
were
met
by
the
objection
the
reply
would
probably
be
an
appeal
to
experience
ten
thousands
as
homer
would
say
mala
murioi
tell
falsehoods
and
fall
into
errors
and
this
is
plato
reply
both
in
the
cratylus
and
sophist
is
flying
is
a
sentence
in
form
quite
as
grammatical
as
is
sitting
the
difference
between
the
two
sentences
is
that
the
one
is
true
and
the
other
false
but
before
making
this
appeal
to
common
sense
plato
propounds
for
our
consideration
a
theory
of
the
nature
of
the
negative
the
theory
is
that
is
relation
is
the
other
of
being
and
has
as
many
kinds
as
there
are
differences
in
being
this
doctrine
is
the
simple
converse
of
the
famous
proposition
of
spinoza
not
determinatio
est
negatio
but
negatio
est
determinatio
not
all
distinction
is
negation
but
all
negation
is
distinction
is
the
unfolding
or
determining
of
being
and
is
a
necessary
element
in
all
other
things
that
are
we
should
be
careful
to
observe
first
that
plato
does
not
identify
being
with
he
has
no
idea
of
progression
by
antagonism
or
of
the
hegelian
vibration
of
moments
he
would
not
have
said
with
heracleitus
things
are
and
are
not
and
become
and
become
not
secondly
he
has
lost
sight
altogether
of
the
other
sense
of
as
the
negative
of
being
although
he
again
and
again
recognizes
the
validity
of
the
law
of
contradiction
thirdly
he
seems
to
confuse
falsehood
with
negation
nor
is
he
quite
consistent
in
regarding
as
one
class
of
being
and
yet
as
coextensive
with
being
in
general
before
analyzing
further
the
topics
thus
suggested
we
will
endeavour
to
trace
the
manner
in
which
plato
arrived
at
his
conception
of
in
all
the
later
dialogues
of
plato
the
idea
of
mind
or
intelligence
becomes
more
and
more
prominent
that
idea
which
anaxagoras
employed
inconsistently
in
the
construction
of
the
world
plato
in
the
philebus
the
sophist
and
the
laws
extends
to
all
things
attributing
to
providence
a
care
infinitesimal
as
well
as
infinite
of
all
creation
the
divine
mind
is
the
leading
religious
thought
of
the
later
works
of
plato
the
human
mind
is
a
sort
of
reflection
of
this
having
ideas
of
being
sameness
and
the
like
at
times
they
seem
to
be
parted
by
a
great
gulf
parmenides
at
other
times
they
have
a
common
nature
and
the
light
of
a
common
intelligence
but
this
idea
of
mind
is
really
irreconcilable
with
the
abstract
pantheism
of
the
eleatics
to
the
passionate
language
of
parmenides
plato
replies
in
a
strain
equally
passionate
what
has
not
being
mind
and
is
not
being
capable
of
being
known
and
if
this
is
admitted
then
capable
of
being
affected
or
acted
upon
in
motion
then
and
yet
not
wholly
incapable
of
rest
already
we
have
been
compelled
to
attribute
opposite
determinations
to
being
and
the
answer
to
the
difficulty
about
being
may
be
equally
the
answer
to
the
difficulty
about
the
answer
is
that
in
these
and
all
other
determinations
of
any
notion
we
are
attributing
to
it
we
went
in
search
of
and
seemed
to
lose
being
and
now
in
the
hunt
after
being
we
recover
both
is
a
kind
of
being
and
in
a
sense
with
being
and
there
are
as
many
divisions
of
as
of
being
to
every
positive
idea
and
the
like
there
is
a
corresponding
negative
idea
and
the
like
a
doubt
may
be
raised
whether
this
account
of
the
negative
is
really
the
true
one
the
common
logicians
would
say
that
the
are
not
really
classes
at
all
but
are
merged
in
one
great
class
of
the
infinite
or
negative
the
conception
of
plato
in
the
days
before
logic
seems
to
be
more
correct
than
this
for
the
word
does
not
altogether
annihilate
the
positive
meaning
of
the
word
at
least
it
does
not
prevent
our
looking
for
the
in
or
about
the
same
class
in
which
we
might
expect
to
find
the
is
is
neither
a
false
nor
an
unmeaning
proposition
the
reason
is
that
the
negative
proposition
has
really
passed
into
an
undefined
positive
to
say
that
has
no
more
meaning
than
that
is
to
say
that
the
two
can
not
in
any
degree
be
distinguished
is
clearly
repugnant
to
the
common
use
of
language
the
ordinary
logic
is
also
jealous
of
the
explanation
of
negation
as
relation
because
seeming
to
take
away
the
principle
of
contradiction
plato
as
far
as
we
know
is
the
first
philosopher
who
distinctly
enunciated
this
principle
and
though
we
need
not
suppose
him
to
have
been
always
consistent
with
himself
there
is
no
real
inconsistency
between
his
explanation
of
the
negative
and
the
principle
of
contradiction
neither
the
platonic
notion
of
the
negative
as
the
principle
of
difference
nor
the
hegelian
identity
of
being
and
at
all
touch
the
principle
of
contradiction
for
what
is
asserted
about
being
and
only
relates
to
our
most
abstract
notions
and
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
principle
of
contradiction
employed
in
the
concrete
because
is
identified
with
other
or
being
with
this
does
not
make
the
proposition
have
not
eaten
any
the
less
a
contradiction
of
have
eaten
the
explanation
of
the
negative
given
by
plato
in
the
sophist
is
a
true
but
partial
one
for
the
word
besides
the
meaning
of
may
also
imply
and
difference
or
opposition
may
be
either
total
or
partial
the
may
be
other
than
the
beautiful
or
in
no
relation
to
the
beautiful
or
a
specific
class
in
various
degrees
opposed
to
the
beautiful
and
the
negative
may
be
a
negation
of
fact
or
of
thought
ou
and
me
lastly
there
are
certain
ideas
such
as
finite
abstract
in
which
the
negative
can
not
be
separated
from
the
positive
and
and
are
inextricably
blended
plato
restricts
the
conception
of
to
difference
man
is
a
rational
animal
and
is
not
as
many
other
things
as
are
not
included
under
this
definition
he
is
and
is
not
and
is
because
he
is
not
besides
the
positive
class
to
which
he
belongs
there
are
endless
negative
classes
to
which
he
may
be
referred
this
is
certainly
intelligible
but
useless
to
refer
a
subject
to
a
negative
class
is
unmeaning
unless
the
is
a
mere
modification
of
the
positive
as
in
the
example
of
honourable
and
or
unless
the
class
is
characterized
by
the
absence
rather
than
the
presence
of
a
particular
quality
nor
is
it
easy
to
see
how
any
more
than
sameness
or
otherness
is
one
of
the
classes
of
being
they
are
aspects
rather
than
classes
of
being
can
only
be
included
in
being
as
the
denial
of
some
particular
class
of
being
if
we
attempt
to
pursue
such
airy
phantoms
at
all
the
hegelian
identity
of
being
and
is
a
more
apt
and
intelligible
expression
of
the
same
mental
phenomenon
for
plato
has
not
distinguished
between
the
being
which
is
prior
to
and
the
being
which
is
the
negation
of
compare
but
he
is
not
thinking
of
this
when
he
says
that
being
comprehends
again
we
should
probably
go
back
for
the
true
explanation
to
the
influence
which
the
eleatic
philosophy
exercised
over
him
under
the
eleatic
had
included
all
the
realities
of
the
sensible
world
led
by
this
association
and
by
the
common
use
of
language
which
has
been
already
noticed
we
can
not
be
much
surprised
that
plato
should
have
made
classes
of
it
is
observable
that
he
does
not
absolutely
deny
that
there
is
an
opposite
of
being
he
is
inclined
to
leave
the
question
merely
remarking
that
the
opposition
if
admissible
at
all
is
not
expressed
by
the
term
on
the
whole
we
must
allow
that
the
great
service
rendered
by
plato
to
metaphysics
in
the
sophist
is
not
his
explanation
of
as
difference
with
this
he
certainly
laid
the
ghost
of
and
we
may
attribute
to
him
in
a
measure
the
credit
of
anticipating
spinoza
and
hegel
but
his
conception
is
not
clear
or
consistent
he
does
not
recognize
the
different
senses
of
the
negative
and
he
confuses
the
different
classes
of
with
the
abstract
notion
as
the
philosopher
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
universal
and
the
true
while
he
placed
the
particulars
of
sense
under
the
false
and
apparent
so
plato
appears
to
identify
negation
with
falsehood
or
is
unable
to
distinguish
them
the
greatest
service
rendered
by
him
to
mental
science
is
the
recognition
of
the
communion
of
classes
which
although
based
by
him
on
his
account
of
is
independent
of
it
he
clearly
saw
that
the
isolation
of
ideas
or
classes
is
the
annihilation
of
reasoning
thus
after
wandering
in
many
diverging
paths
we
return
to
common
sense
and
for
this
reason
we
may
be
inclined
to
do
less
than
justice
to
plato
because
the
truth
which
he
attains
by
a
real
effort
of
thought
is
to
us
a
familiar
and
unconscious
truism
which
no
one
would
any
longer
think
either
of
doubting
or
examining
iv
the
later
dialogues
of
plato
contain
many
references
to
contemporary
philosophy
both
in
the
theaetetus
and
in
the
sophist
he
recognizes
that
he
is
in
the
midst
of
a
fray
a
huge
irregular
battle
everywhere
surrounds
him
first
there
are
the
two
great
philosophies
going
back
into
cosmogony
and
poetry
the
philosophy
of
heracleitus
supposed
to
have
a
poetical
origin
in
homer
and
that
of
the
eleatics
which
in
a
similar
spirit
he
conceives
to
be
even
older
than
xenophanes
compare
still
older
were
theories
of
two
and
three
principles
hot
and
cold
moist
and
dry
which
were
ever
marrying
and
being
given
in
marriage
in
speaking
of
these
he
is
probably
referring
to
pherecydes
and
the
early
ionians
in
the
philosophy
of
motion
there
were
different
accounts
of
the
relation
of
plurality
and
unity
which
were
supposed
to
be
joined
and
severed
by
love
and
hate
some
maintaining
that
this
process
was
perpetually
going
on
heracleitus
others
empedocles
that
there
was
an
alternation
of
them
of
the
pythagoreans
or
of
anaxagoras
he
makes
no
distinct
mention
his
chief
opponents
are
first
eristics
or
megarians
secondly
the
materialists
the
picture
which
he
gives
of
both
these
latter
schools
is
indistinct
and
he
appears
reluctant
to
mention
the
names
of
their
teachers
nor
can
we
easily
determine
how
much
is
to
be
assigned
to
the
cynics
how
much
to
the
megarians
or
whether
the
materialists
theaet
are
cynics
or
atomists
or
represent
some
unknown
phase
of
opinion
at
athens
to
the
cynics
and
antisthenes
is
commonly
attributed
on
the
authority
of
aristotle
the
denial
of
predication
while
the
megarians
are
said
to
have
been
nominalists
asserting
the
one
good
under
many
names
to
be
the
true
being
of
zeno
and
the
eleatics
and
like
zeno
employing
their
negative
dialectic
in
the
refutation
of
opponents
but
the
later
megarians
also
denied
predication
and
this
tenet
which
is
attributed
to
all
of
them
by
simplicius
is
certainly
in
accordance
with
their
philosophy
the
young
and
old
of
whom
plato
speaks
probably
include
both
at
any
rate
we
shall
be
safer
in
accepting
the
general
description
of
them
which
he
has
given
and
in
not
attempting
to
draw
a
precise
line
between
them
of
these
eristics
whether
cynics
or
megarians
several
characteristics
are
found
in
plato
they
pursue
verbal
oppositions
they
make
reasoning
impossible
by
their
in
the
use
of
language
they
deny
predication
they
go
from
unity
to
plurality
without
passing
through
the
intermediate
stages
they
refuse
to
attribute
motion
or
power
to
being
they
are
the
enemies
of
sense
whether
they
are
the
of
ideas
who
carry
on
the
polemic
against
sense
is
uncertain
probably
under
this
remarkable
expression
plato
designates
those
who
more
nearly
approached
himself
and
may
be
criticizing
an
earlier
form
of
his
own
doctrines
we
may
observe
that
he
professes
only
to
give
us
a
few
opinions
out
of
many
which
were
at
that
time
current
in
greece
that
he
nowhere
alludes
to
the
ethical
teaching
of
the
cynics
unless
the
argument
in
the
protagoras
that
the
virtues
are
one
and
not
many
may
be
supposed
to
contain
a
reference
to
their
views
as
well
as
to
those
of
socrates
and
unless
they
are
the
school
alluded
to
in
the
philebus
which
is
described
as
very
skilful
in
physics
and
as
maintaining
pleasure
to
be
the
absence
of
pain
that
antisthenes
wrote
a
book
called
is
hardly
a
sufficient
reason
for
describing
them
as
skilful
in
physics
which
appear
to
have
been
very
alien
to
the
tendency
of
the
cynics
the
idealism
of
the
fourth
century
before
christ
in
greece
as
in
other
ages
and
countries
seems
to
have
provoked
a
reaction
towards
materialism
the
maintainers
of
this
doctrine
are
described
in
the
theaetetus
as
obstinate
persons
who
will
believe
in
nothing
which
they
can
not
hold
in
their
hands
and
in
the
sophist
as
incapable
of
argument
they
are
probably
the
same
who
are
said
in
the
tenth
book
of
the
laws
to
attribute
the
course
of
events
to
nature
art
and
chance
who
they
were
we
have
no
means
of
determining
except
from
plato
description
of
them
his
silence
respecting
the
atomists
might
lead
us
to
suppose
that
here
we
have
a
trace
of
them
but
the
atomists
were
not
materialists
in
the
grosser
sense
of
the
term
nor
were
they
incapable
of
reasoning
and
plato
would
hardly
have
described
a
great
genius
like
democritus
in
the
disdainful
terms
which
he
uses
of
the
materialists
upon
the
whole
we
must
infer
that
the
persons
here
spoken
of
are
unknown
to
us
like
the
many
other
writers
and
talkers
at
athens
and
elsewhere
of
whose
endless
activity
of
mind
aristotle
in
his
metaphysics
has
preserved
an
anonymous
memorial
the
sophist
is
the
sequel
of
the
theaetetus
and
is
connected
with
the
parmenides
by
a
direct
allusion
compare
introductions
to
theaetetus
and
parmenides
in
the
theaetetus
we
sought
to
discover
the
nature
of
knowledge
and
false
opinion
but
the
nature
of
false
opinion
seemed
impenetrable
for
we
were
unable
to
understand
how
there
could
be
any
reality
in
in
the
sophist
the
question
is
taken
up
again
the
nature
of
is
detected
and
there
is
no
longer
any
metaphysical
impediment
in
the
way
of
admitting
the
possibility
of
falsehood
to
the
parmenides
the
sophist
stands
in
a
less
defined
and
more
remote
relation
there
human
thought
is
in
process
of
disorganization
no
absurdity
or
inconsistency
is
too
great
to
be
elicited
from
the
analysis
of
the
simple
ideas
of
unity
or
being
in
the
sophist
the
same
contradictions
are
pursued
to
a
certain
extent
but
only
with
a
view
to
their
resolution
the
aim
of
the
dialogue
is
to
show
how
the
few
elemental
conceptions
of
the
human
mind
admit
of
a
natural
connexion
in
thought
and
speech
which
megarian
or
other
sophistry
vainly
attempts
to
deny
true
to
the
appointment
of
the
previous
day
theodorus
and
theaetetus
meet
socrates
at
the
same
spot
bringing
with
them
an
eleatic
stranger
whom
theodorus
introduces
as
a
true
philosopher
socrates
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
declares
that
he
must
be
a
god
in
disguise
who
as
homer
would
say
has
come
to
earth
that
he
may
visit
the
good
and
evil
among
men
and
detect
the
foolishness
of
athenian
wisdom
at
any
rate
he
is
a
divine
person
one
of
a
class
who
are
hardly
recognized
on
earth
who
appear
in
divers
forms
now
as
statesmen
now
as
sophists
and
are
often
deemed
madmen
statesman
sophist
says
socrates
repeating
the
words
should
like
to
ask
our
eleatic
friend
what
his
countrymen
think
of
them
do
they
regard
them
as
one
or
three
the
stranger
has
been
already
asked
the
same
question
by
theodorus
and
theaetetus
and
he
at
once
replies
that
they
are
thought
to
be
three
but
to
explain
the
difference
fully
would
take
time
he
is
pressed
to
give
this
fuller
explanation
either
in
the
form
of
a
speech
or
of
question
and
answer
he
prefers
the
latter
and
chooses
as
his
respondent
theaetetus
whom
he
already
knows
and
who
is
recommended
to
him
by
socrates
we
are
agreed
he
says
about
the
name
sophist
but
we
may
not
be
equally
agreed
about
his
nature
great
subjects
should
be
approached
through
familiar
examples
and
considering
that
he
is
a
creature
not
easily
caught
i
think
that
before
approaching
him
we
should
try
our
hand
upon
some
more
obvious
animal
who
may
be
made
the
subject
of
logical
experiment
shall
we
say
an
angler
good
in
the
first
place
the
angler
is
an
artist
and
there
are
two
kinds
of
art
productive
art
which
includes
husbandry
manufactures
imitations
and
acquisitive
art
which
includes
learning
trading
fighting
hunting
the
angler
is
an
acquisitive
art
and
acquisition
may
be
effected
either
by
exchange
or
by
conquest
in
the
latter
case
either
by
force
or
craft
conquest
by
craft
is
called
hunting
and
of
hunting
there
is
one
kind
which
pursues
inanimate
and
another
which
pursues
animate
objects
and
animate
objects
may
be
either
land
animals
or
water
animals
and
water
animals
either
fly
over
the
water
or
live
in
the
water
the
hunting
of
the
last
is
called
fishing
and
of
fishing
one
kind
uses
enclosures
catching
the
fish
in
nets
and
baskets
and
another
kind
strikes
them
either
with
spears
by
night
or
with
barbed
spears
or
barbed
hooks
by
day
the
barbed
spears
are
impelled
from
above
the
barbed
hooks
are
jerked
into
the
head
and
lips
of
the
fish
which
are
then
drawn
from
below
upwards
thus
by
a
series
of
divisions
we
have
arrived
at
the
definition
of
the
angler
art
and
now
by
the
help
of
this
example
we
may
proceed
to
bring
to
light
the
nature
of
the
sophist
like
the
angler
he
is
an
artist
and
the
resemblance
does
not
end
here
for
they
are
both
hunters
and
hunters
of
animals
the
one
of
water
and
the
other
of
land
animals
but
at
this
point
they
diverge
the
one
going
to
the
sea
and
the
rivers
and
the
other
to
the
rivers
of
wealth
and
rich
in
which
generous
youth
abide
on
land
you
may
hunt
tame
animals
or
you
may
hunt
wild
animals
and
man
is
a
tame
animal
and
he
may
be
hunted
either
by
force
or
persuasion
either
by
the
pirate
soldier
or
by
the
lawyer
orator
talker
the
latter
use
persuasion
and
persuasion
is
either
private
or
public
of
the
private
practitioners
of
the
art
some
bring
gifts
to
those
whom
they
hunt
these
are
lovers
and
others
take
hire
and
some
of
these
flatter
and
in
return
are
fed
others
profess
to
teach
virtue
and
receive
a
round
sum
and
who
are
these
last
tell
me
who
have
we
not
unearthed
the
sophist
but
he
is
a
creature
and
may
still
be
traced
in
another
line
of
descent
the
acquisitive
art
had
a
branch
of
exchange
as
well
as
of
hunting
and
exchange
is
either
giving
or
selling
and
the
seller
is
either
a
manufacturer
or
a
merchant
and
the
merchant
either
retails
or
exports
and
the
exporter
may
export
either
food
for
the
body
or
food
for
the
mind
and
of
this
trading
in
food
for
the
mind
one
kind
may
be
termed
the
art
of
display
and
another
the
art
of
selling
learning
and
learning
may
be
a
learning
of
the
arts
or
of
virtue
the
seller
of
the
arts
may
be
called
an
the
seller
of
virtue
a
sophist
again
there
is
a
third
line
in
which
a
sophist
may
be
traced
for
is
he
less
a
sophist
when
instead
of
exporting
his
wares
to
another
country
he
stays
at
home
and
retails
goods
which
he
not
only
buys
of
others
but
manufactures
himself
or
he
may
be
descended
from
the
acquisitive
art
in
the
combative
line
through
the
pugnacious
the
controversial
the
disputatious
arts
and
he
will
be
found
at
last
in
the
eristic
section
of
the
latter
and
in
that
division
of
it
which
disputes
in
private
for
gain
about
the
general
principles
of
right
and
wrong
and
still
there
is
a
track
of
him
which
has
not
yet
been
followed
out
by
us
do
not
our
household
servants
talk
of
sifting
straining
winnowing
and
they
also
speak
of
carding
spinning
and
the
like
all
these
are
processes
of
division
and
of
division
there
are
two
kinds
one
in
which
like
is
divided
from
like
and
another
in
which
the
good
is
separated
from
the
bad
the
latter
of
the
two
is
termed
purification
and
again
of
purification
there
are
two
sorts
of
animate
bodies
which
may
be
internal
or
external
and
of
inanimate
medicine
and
gymnastic
are
the
internal
purifications
of
the
animate
and
bathing
the
external
and
of
the
inanimate
fulling
and
cleaning
and
other
humble
processes
some
of
which
have
ludicrous
names
not
that
dialectic
is
a
respecter
of
names
or
persons
or
a
despiser
of
humble
occupations
nor
does
she
think
much
of
the
greater
or
less
benefits
conferred
by
them
for
her
aim
is
knowledge
she
wants
to
know
how
the
arts
are
related
to
one
another
and
would
quite
as
soon
learn
the
nature
of
hunting
from
the
as
from
the
general
and
she
only
desires
to
have
a
general
name
which
shall
distinguish
purifications
of
the
soul
from
purifications
of
the
body
now
purification
is
the
taking
away
of
evil
and
there
are
two
kinds
of
evil
in
the
soul
the
one
answering
to
disease
in
the
body
and
the
other
to
deformity
disease
is
the
discord
or
war
of
opposite
principles
in
the
soul
and
deformity
is
the
want
of
symmetry
or
failure
in
the
attainment
of
a
mark
or
measure
the
latter
arises
from
ignorance
and
no
one
is
voluntarily
ignorant
ignorance
is
only
the
aberration
of
the
soul
moving
towards
knowledge
and
as
medicine
cures
the
diseases
and
gymnastic
the
deformity
of
the
body
so
correction
cures
the
injustice
and
education
which
differs
among
the
hellenes
from
mere
instruction
in
the
arts
cures
the
ignorance
of
the
soul
again
ignorance
is
twofold
simple
ignorance
and
ignorance
having
the
conceit
of
knowledge
and
education
is
also
twofold
there
is
the
moral
training
of
our
forefathers
which
was
very
troublesome
and
not
very
successful
and
another
of
a
more
subtle
nature
which
proceeds
upon
a
notion
that
all
ignorance
is
involuntary
the
latter
convicts
a
man
out
of
his
own
mouth
by
pointing
out
to
him
his
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
and
the
consequence
is
that
he
quarrels
with
himself
instead
of
quarrelling
with
his
neighbours
and
is
cured
of
prejudices
and
obstructions
by
a
mode
of
treatment
which
is
equally
entertaining
and
effectual
the
physician
of
the
soul
is
aware
that
his
patient
will
receive
no
nourishment
unless
he
has
been
cleaned
out
and
the
soul
of
the
great
king
himself
if
he
has
not
undergone
this
purification
is
unclean
and
impure
and
who
are
the
ministers
of
the
purification
sophists
i
may
not
call
them
yet
they
bear
about
the
same
likeness
to
sophists
as
the
dog
who
is
the
gentlest
of
animals
does
to
the
wolf
who
is
the
fiercest
comparisons
are
slippery
things
but
for
the
present
let
us
assume
the
resemblance
of
the
two
which
may
probably
be
disallowed
hereafter
and
so
from
division
comes
purification
and
from
this
mental
purification
and
from
mental
purification
instruction
and
from
instruction
education
and
from
education
the
art
of
sophistry
which
is
engaged
in
the
detection
of
conceit
i
do
not
however
think
that
we
have
yet
found
the
sophist
or
that
his
will
ultimately
prove
to
be
the
desired
art
of
education
but
neither
do
i
think
that
he
can
long
escape
me
for
every
way
is
blocked
before
we
make
the
final
assault
let
us
take
breath
and
reckon
up
the
many
forms
which
he
has
assumed
he
was
the
paid
hunter
of
wealth
and
birth
he
was
the
trader
in
the
goods
of
the
soul
he
was
the
retailer
of
them
he
was
the
manufacturer
of
his
own
learned
wares
he
was
the
disputant
and
he
was
the
purger
away
of
prejudices
although
this
latter
point
is
admitted
to
be
doubtful
now
there
must
surely
be
something
wrong
in
the
professor
of
any
art
having
so
many
names
and
kinds
of
knowledge
does
not
the
very
number
of
them
imply
that
the
nature
of
his
art
is
not
understood
and
that
we
may
not
be
involved
in
the
misunderstanding
let
us
observe
which
of
his
characteristics
is
the
most
prominent
above
all
things
he
is
a
disputant
he
will
dispute
and
teach
others
to
dispute
about
things
visible
and
invisible
about
man
about
the
gods
about
politics
about
law
about
wrestling
about
all
things
but
can
he
know
all
things
can
not
how
then
can
he
dispute
satisfactorily
with
any
one
who
knows
then
what
is
the
trick
of
his
art
and
why
does
he
receive
money
from
his
admirers
he
is
believed
by
them
to
know
all
things
you
mean
to
say
that
he
seems
to
have
a
knowledge
of
them
suppose
a
person
were
to
say
not
that
he
would
dispute
about
all
things
but
that
he
would
make
all
things
you
and
me
and
all
other
creatures
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
the
gods
and
would
sell
them
all
for
a
few
pence
this
would
be
a
great
jest
but
not
greater
than
if
he
said
that
he
knew
all
things
and
could
teach
them
in
a
short
time
and
at
a
small
cost
for
all
imitation
is
a
jest
and
the
most
graceful
form
of
jest
now
the
painter
is
a
man
who
professes
to
make
all
things
and
children
who
see
his
pictures
at
a
distance
sometimes
take
them
for
realities
and
the
sophist
pretends
to
know
all
things
and
he
too
can
deceive
young
men
who
are
still
at
a
distance
from
the
truth
not
through
their
eyes
but
through
their
ears
by
the
mummery
of
words
and
induce
them
to
believe
him
but
as
they
grow
older
and
come
into
contact
with
realities
they
learn
by
experience
the
futility
of
his
pretensions
the
sophist
then
has
not
real
knowledge
he
is
only
an
imitator
or
and
now
having
got
him
in
a
corner
of
the
dialectical
net
let
us
divide
and
subdivide
until
we
catch
him
of
there
are
two
kinds
the
art
of
making
likenesses
and
the
art
of
making
appearances
the
latter
may
be
illustrated
by
sculpture
and
painting
which
often
use
illusions
and
alter
the
proportions
of
figures
in
order
to
adapt
their
works
to
the
eye
and
the
sophist
also
uses
illusions
and
his
imitations
are
apparent
and
not
real
but
how
can
anything
be
an
appearance
only
here
arises
a
difficulty
which
has
always
beset
the
subject
of
appearances
for
the
argument
is
asserting
the
existence
of
and
this
is
what
the
great
parmenides
was
all
his
life
denying
in
prose
and
also
in
verse
will
never
find
he
says
is
and
the
words
prove
themselves
can
not
be
attributed
to
any
being
for
how
can
any
being
be
wholly
abstracted
from
being
again
in
every
predication
there
is
an
attribution
of
singular
or
plural
but
number
is
the
most
real
of
all
things
and
can
not
be
attributed
to
therefore
can
not
be
predicated
or
expressed
for
how
can
we
say
not
without
number
and
now
arises
the
greatest
difficulty
of
all
if
is
inconceivable
how
can
be
refuted
and
am
i
not
contradicting
myself
at
this
moment
in
speaking
either
in
the
singular
or
the
plural
of
that
to
which
i
deny
both
plurality
and
unity
you
theaetetus
have
the
might
of
youth
and
i
conjure
you
to
exert
yourself
and
if
you
can
to
find
an
expression
for
which
does
not
imply
being
and
number
i
can
not
then
the
sophist
must
be
left
in
his
hole
we
may
call
him
an
if
we
please
but
he
will
only
say
pray
what
is
an
image
and
we
shall
reply
reflection
in
the
water
or
in
a
mirror
and
he
will
say
us
shut
our
eyes
and
open
our
minds
what
is
the
common
notion
of
all
images
should
answer
such
another
made
in
the
likeness
of
the
true
real
or
not
real
real
at
least
not
in
a
true
sense
and
the
real
and
the
not
then
a
likeness
is
really
unreal
and
essentially
not
here
is
a
pretty
complication
of
being
and
in
which
the
sophist
has
entangled
us
he
will
at
once
point
out
that
he
is
compelling
us
to
contradict
ourselves
by
affirming
being
of
i
think
that
we
must
cease
to
look
for
him
in
the
class
of
imitators
but
ought
we
to
give
him
up
should
say
certainly
not
then
i
fear
that
i
must
lay
hands
on
my
father
parmenides
but
do
not
call
me
a
parricide
for
there
is
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
except
to
show
that
in
some
sense
is
and
if
this
is
not
admitted
no
one
can
speak
of
falsehood
or
false
opinion
or
imitation
without
falling
into
a
contradiction
you
observe
how
unwilling
i
am
to
undertake
the
task
for
i
know
that
i
am
exposing
myself
to
the
charge
of
inconsistency
in
asserting
the
being
of
but
if
i
am
to
make
the
attempt
i
think
that
i
had
better
begin
at
the
beginning
lightly
in
the
days
of
our
youth
parmenides
and
others
told
us
tales
about
the
origin
of
the
universe
one
spoke
of
three
principles
warring
and
at
peace
again
marrying
and
begetting
children
another
of
two
principles
hot
and
cold
dry
and
moist
which
also
formed
relationships
there
were
the
eleatics
in
our
part
of
the
world
saying
that
all
things
are
one
whose
doctrine
begins
with
xenophanes
and
is
even
older
ionian
and
more
recently
sicilian
muses
speak
of
a
one
and
many
which
are
held
together
by
enmity
and
friendship
ever
parting
ever
meeting
some
of
them
do
not
insist
on
the
perpetual
strife
but
adopt
a
gentler
strain
and
speak
of
alternation
only
whether
they
are
right
or
not
who
can
say
but
one
thing
we
can
say
that
they
went
on
their
way
without
much
caring
whether
we
understood
them
or
not
for
tell
me
theaetetus
do
you
understand
what
they
mean
by
their
assertion
of
unity
or
by
their
combinations
and
separations
of
two
or
more
principles
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
young
that
i
knew
all
about
and
now
i
am
in
great
difficulties
even
about
being
let
us
proceed
first
to
the
examination
of
being
turning
to
the
dualist
philosophers
we
say
to
them
is
being
a
third
element
besides
hot
and
cold
or
do
you
identify
one
or
both
of
the
two
elements
with
being
at
any
rate
you
can
hardly
avoid
resolving
them
into
one
let
us
next
interrogate
the
patrons
of
the
one
to
them
we
say
are
being
and
one
two
different
names
for
the
same
thing
but
how
can
there
be
two
names
when
there
is
nothing
but
one
or
you
may
identify
them
but
then
the
name
will
be
either
the
name
of
nothing
or
of
itself
of
a
name
again
the
notion
of
being
is
conceived
of
as
a
whole
in
the
words
of
parmenides
every
way
unto
a
rounded
sphere
and
a
whole
has
parts
but
that
which
has
parts
is
not
one
for
unity
has
no
parts
is
being
then
one
because
the
parts
of
being
are
one
or
shall
we
say
that
being
is
not
a
whole
in
the
former
case
one
is
made
up
of
parts
and
in
the
latter
there
is
still
plurality
viz
being
and
a
whole
which
is
apart
from
being
and
being
if
not
all
things
lacks
something
of
the
nature
of
being
and
becomes
nor
can
being
ever
have
come
into
existence
for
nothing
comes
into
existence
except
as
a
whole
nor
can
being
have
number
for
that
which
has
number
is
a
whole
or
sum
of
number
these
are
a
few
of
the
difficulties
which
are
accumulating
one
upon
another
in
the
consideration
of
being
we
may
proceed
now
to
the
less
exact
sort
of
philosophers
some
of
them
drag
down
everything
to
earth
and
carry
on
a
war
like
that
of
the
giants
grasping
rocks
and
oaks
in
their
hands
their
adversaries
defend
themselves
warily
from
an
invisible
world
and
reduce
the
substances
of
their
opponents
to
the
minutest
fractions
until
they
are
lost
in
generation
and
flux
the
latter
sort
are
civil
people
enough
but
the
materialists
are
rude
and
ignorant
of
dialectics
they
must
be
taught
how
to
argue
before
they
can
answer
yet
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
we
may
assume
them
to
be
better
than
they
are
and
able
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
they
admit
the
existence
of
a
mortal
living
creature
which
is
a
body
containing
a
soul
and
to
this
they
would
not
refuse
to
attribute
qualities
wisdom
folly
justice
and
injustice
the
soul
as
they
say
has
a
kind
of
body
but
they
do
not
like
to
assert
of
these
qualities
of
the
soul
either
that
they
are
corporeal
or
that
they
have
no
existence
at
this
point
they
begin
to
make
distinctions
of
earth
we
say
to
them
both
visible
and
invisible
qualities
exist
what
is
the
common
nature
which
is
attributed
to
them
by
the
term
being
or
existence
and
as
they
are
incapable
of
answering
this
question
we
may
as
well
reply
for
them
that
being
is
the
power
of
doing
or
suffering
then
we
turn
to
the
friends
of
ideas
to
them
we
say
distinguish
becoming
from
being
they
will
reply
in
becoming
you
participate
through
the
bodily
senses
and
in
being
by
thought
and
the
mind
and
you
mean
by
the
word
a
power
of
doing
or
suffering
to
this
they
answer
i
am
acquainted
with
them
theaetetus
and
know
their
ways
better
than
you
do
that
being
can
neither
do
nor
suffer
though
becoming
may
and
we
rejoin
does
not
the
soul
know
and
is
not
known
and
are
not
and
known
active
and
passive
that
which
is
known
is
affected
by
knowledge
and
therefore
is
in
motion
and
indeed
how
can
we
imagine
that
perfect
being
is
a
mere
everlasting
form
devoid
of
motion
and
soul
for
there
can
be
no
thought
without
soul
nor
can
soul
be
devoid
of
motion
but
neither
can
thought
or
mind
be
devoid
of
some
principle
of
rest
or
stability
and
as
children
say
entreatingly
us
both
so
the
philosopher
must
include
both
the
moveable
and
immoveable
in
his
idea
of
being
and
yet
alas
he
and
we
are
in
the
same
difficulty
with
which
we
reproached
the
dualists
for
motion
and
rest
are
contradictions
how
then
can
they
both
exist
does
he
who
affirms
this
mean
to
say
that
motion
is
rest
or
rest
motion
he
means
to
assert
the
existence
of
some
third
thing
different
from
them
both
which
neither
rests
nor
moves
but
how
can
there
be
anything
which
neither
rests
nor
moves
here
is
a
second
difficulty
about
being
quite
as
great
as
that
about
and
we
may
hope
that
any
light
which
is
thrown
upon
the
one
may
extend
to
the
other
leaving
them
for
the
present
let
us
enquire
what
we
mean
by
giving
many
names
to
the
same
thing
white
good
tall
to
man
out
of
which
tyros
old
and
young
derive
such
a
feast
of
amusement
their
meagre
minds
refuse
to
predicate
anything
of
anything
they
say
that
good
is
good
and
man
is
man
and
that
to
affirm
one
of
the
other
would
be
making
the
many
one
and
the
one
many
let
us
place
them
in
a
class
with
our
previous
opponents
and
interrogate
both
of
them
at
once
shall
we
assume
that
being
and
rest
and
motion
and
all
other
things
are
incommunicable
with
one
another
or
that
they
all
have
indiscriminate
communion
or
that
there
is
communion
of
some
and
not
of
others
and
we
will
consider
the
first
hypothesis
first
of
all
if
we
suppose
the
universal
separation
of
kinds
all
theories
alike
are
swept
away
the
patrons
of
a
single
principle
of
rest
or
of
motion
or
of
a
plurality
of
immutable
ideas
all
alike
have
the
ground
cut
from
under
them
and
all
creators
of
the
universe
by
theories
of
composition
and
division
whether
out
of
or
into
a
finite
or
infinite
number
of
elemental
forms
in
alternation
or
continuance
share
the
same
fate
most
ridiculous
is
the
discomfiture
which
attends
the
opponents
of
predication
who
like
the
ventriloquist
eurycles
have
the
voice
that
answers
them
in
their
own
breast
for
they
can
not
help
using
the
words
others
and
the
like
and
their
adversaries
are
thus
saved
the
trouble
of
refuting
them
but
if
all
things
have
communion
with
all
things
motion
will
rest
and
rest
will
move
here
is
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
two
out
of
the
three
hypotheses
are
thus
seen
to
be
false
the
third
remains
which
affirms
that
only
certain
things
communicate
with
certain
other
things
in
the
alphabet
and
the
scale
there
are
some
letters
and
notes
which
combine
with
others
and
some
which
do
not
and
the
laws
according
to
which
they
combine
or
are
separated
are
known
to
the
grammarian
and
musician
and
there
is
a
science
which
teaches
not
only
what
notes
and
letters
but
what
classes
admit
of
combination
with
one
another
and
what
not
this
is
a
noble
science
on
which
we
have
stumbled
unawares
in
seeking
after
the
sophist
we
have
found
the
philosopher
he
is
the
master
who
discerns
one
whole
or
form
pervading
a
scattered
multitude
and
many
such
wholes
combined
under
a
higher
one
and
many
entirely
apart
he
is
the
true
dialectician
like
the
sophist
he
is
hard
to
recognize
though
for
the
opposite
reasons
the
sophist
runs
away
into
the
obscurity
of
the
philosopher
is
dark
from
excess
of
light
and
now
leaving
him
we
will
return
to
our
pursuit
of
the
sophist
agreeing
in
the
truth
of
the
third
hypothesis
that
some
things
have
communion
and
others
not
and
that
some
may
have
communion
with
all
let
us
examine
the
most
important
kinds
which
are
capable
of
admixture
and
in
this
way
we
may
perhaps
find
out
a
sense
in
which
may
be
affirmed
to
have
being
now
the
highest
kinds
are
being
rest
motion
and
of
these
rest
and
motion
exclude
each
other
but
both
of
them
are
included
in
being
and
again
they
are
the
same
with
themselves
and
the
other
of
each
other
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
and
are
there
two
more
kinds
to
be
added
to
the
three
others
for
sameness
can
not
be
either
rest
or
motion
because
predicated
both
of
rest
and
motion
nor
yet
being
because
if
being
were
attributed
to
both
of
them
we
should
attribute
sameness
to
both
of
them
nor
can
other
be
identified
with
being
for
then
other
which
is
relative
would
have
the
absoluteness
of
being
therefore
we
must
assume
a
fifth
principle
which
is
universal
and
runs
through
all
things
for
each
thing
is
other
than
all
other
things
thus
there
are
five
principles
being
motion
which
is
not
rest
and
because
participating
both
in
the
same
and
other
is
and
is
not
the
same
with
itself
and
is
and
is
not
other
than
the
other
and
motion
is
not
being
but
partakes
of
being
and
therefore
is
and
is
not
in
the
most
absolute
sense
thus
we
have
discovered
that
is
the
principle
of
the
other
which
runs
through
all
things
being
not
excepted
and
is
one
thing
and
includes
and
is
all
other
things
and
is
not
the
opposite
of
being
but
only
the
other
knowledge
has
many
branches
and
the
other
or
difference
has
as
many
each
of
which
is
described
by
prefixing
the
word
to
some
kind
of
knowledge
the
is
as
real
as
the
beautiful
the
as
the
just
and
the
essence
of
the
is
to
be
separated
from
and
opposed
to
a
certain
kind
of
existence
which
is
termed
beautiful
and
this
opposition
and
negation
is
the
of
which
we
are
in
search
and
is
one
kind
of
being
thus
in
spite
of
parmenides
we
have
not
only
discovered
the
existence
but
also
the
nature
of
that
nature
we
have
found
to
be
relation
in
the
communion
of
different
kinds
being
and
other
mutually
interpenetrate
other
is
but
is
other
than
being
and
other
than
each
and
all
of
the
remaining
kinds
and
therefore
in
an
infinity
of
ways
not
and
the
argument
has
shown
that
the
pursuit
of
contradictions
is
childish
and
useless
and
the
very
opposite
of
that
higher
spirit
which
criticizes
the
words
of
another
according
to
the
natural
meaning
of
them
nothing
can
be
more
unphilosophical
than
the
denial
of
all
communion
of
kinds
and
we
are
fortunate
in
having
established
such
a
communion
for
another
reason
because
in
continuing
the
hunt
after
the
sophist
we
have
to
examine
the
nature
of
discourse
and
there
could
be
no
discourse
if
there
were
no
communion
for
the
sophist
although
he
can
no
longer
deny
the
existence
of
may
still
affirm
that
can
not
enter
into
discourse
and
as
he
was
arguing
before
that
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
falsehood
because
there
was
no
such
thing
as
he
may
continue
to
argue
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
art
of
and
phantastic
because
has
no
place
in
language
hence
arises
the
necessity
of
examining
speech
opinion
and
imagination
and
first
concerning
speech
let
us
ask
the
same
question
about
words
which
we
have
already
answered
about
the
kinds
of
being
and
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
to
what
extent
do
they
admit
of
combination
some
words
have
a
meaning
when
combined
and
others
have
no
meaning
one
class
of
words
describes
action
another
class
agents
are
examples
of
the
first
of
the
second
but
no
combination
of
words
can
be
formed
without
a
verb
and
a
noun
man
learns
the
simplest
sentence
is
composed
of
two
words
and
one
of
these
must
be
a
subject
for
example
in
the
sentence
sits
which
is
not
very
long
is
the
subject
and
in
the
sentence
flies
is
again
the
subject
but
the
two
sentences
differ
in
quality
for
the
first
says
of
you
that
which
is
true
and
the
second
says
of
you
that
which
is
not
true
or
in
other
words
attributes
to
you
things
which
are
not
as
though
they
were
here
is
false
discourse
in
the
shortest
form
and
thus
not
only
speech
but
thought
and
opinion
and
imagination
are
proved
to
be
both
true
and
false
for
thought
is
only
the
process
of
silent
speech
and
opinion
is
only
the
silent
assent
or
denial
which
follows
this
and
imagination
is
only
the
expression
of
this
in
some
form
of
sense
all
of
them
are
akin
to
speech
and
therefore
like
speech
admit
of
true
and
false
and
we
have
discovered
false
opinion
which
is
an
encouraging
sign
of
our
probable
success
in
the
rest
of
the
enquiry
then
now
let
us
return
to
our
old
division
of
and
phantastic
when
we
were
going
to
place
the
sophist
in
one
of
them
a
doubt
arose
whether
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
an
appearance
because
there
was
no
such
thing
as
falsehood
at
length
falsehood
has
been
discovered
by
us
to
exist
and
we
have
acknowledged
that
the
sophist
is
to
be
found
in
the
class
of
imitators
all
art
was
divided
originally
by
us
into
two
branches
productive
and
acquisitive
and
now
we
may
divide
both
on
a
different
principle
into
the
creations
or
imitations
which
are
of
human
and
those
which
are
of
divine
origin
for
we
must
admit
that
the
world
and
ourselves
and
the
animals
did
not
come
into
existence
by
chance
or
the
spontaneous
working
of
nature
but
by
divine
reason
and
knowledge
and
there
are
not
only
divine
creations
but
divine
imitations
such
as
apparitions
and
shadows
and
reflections
which
are
equally
the
work
of
a
divine
mind
and
there
are
human
creations
and
human
imitations
too
there
is
the
actual
house
and
the
drawing
of
it
nor
must
we
forget
that
may
be
an
imitation
of
realities
or
an
imitation
of
appearances
which
last
has
been
called
by
us
phantastic
and
this
phantastic
may
be
again
divided
into
imitation
by
the
help
of
instruments
and
impersonations
and
the
latter
may
be
either
dissembling
or
unconscious
either
with
or
without
knowledge
a
man
can
not
imitate
you
theaetetus
without
knowing
you
but
he
can
imitate
the
form
of
justice
or
virtue
if
he
have
a
sentiment
or
opinion
about
them
not
being
well
provided
with
names
the
former
i
will
venture
to
call
the
imitation
of
science
and
the
latter
the
imitation
of
opinion
the
latter
is
our
present
concern
for
the
sophist
has
no
claims
to
science
or
knowledge
now
the
imitator
who
has
only
opinion
may
be
either
the
simple
imitator
who
thinks
that
he
knows
or
the
dissembler
who
is
conscious
that
he
does
not
know
but
disguises
his
ignorance
and
the
last
may
be
either
a
maker
of
long
speeches
or
of
shorter
speeches
which
compel
the
person
conversing
to
contradict
himself
the
maker
of
longer
speeches
is
the
popular
orator
the
maker
of
the
shorter
is
the
sophist
whose
art
may
be
traced
as
being
the
contradictious
dissembling
without
knowledge
human
and
not
divine
juggling
with
words
phantastic
or
unreal
art
of
in
commenting
on
the
dialogue
in
which
plato
most
nearly
approaches
the
great
modern
master
of
metaphysics
there
are
several
points
which
it
will
be
useful
to
consider
such
as
the
unity
of
opposites
the
conception
of
the
ideas
as
causes
and
the
relation
of
the
platonic
and
hegelian
dialectic
the
unity
of
opposites
was
the
crux
of
ancient
thinkers
in
the
age
of
plato
how
could
one
thing
be
or
become
another
that
substances
have
attributes
was
implied
in
common
language
that
heat
and
cold
day
and
night
pass
into
one
another
was
a
matter
of
experience
a
level
with
the
cobbler
understanding
but
how
could
philosophy
explain
the
connexion
of
ideas
how
justify
the
passing
of
them
into
one
another
the
abstractions
of
one
other
being
rest
motion
individual
universal
which
successive
generations
of
philosophers
had
recently
discovered
seemed
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
human
thought
like
stars
shining
in
a
distant
heaven
they
were
the
symbols
of
different
schools
of
philosophy
but
in
what
relation
did
they
stand
to
one
another
and
to
the
world
of
sense
it
was
hardly
conceivable
that
one
could
be
other
or
the
same
different
yet
without
some
reconciliation
of
these
elementary
ideas
thought
was
impossible
there
was
no
distinction
between
truth
and
falsehood
between
the
sophist
and
the
philosopher
everything
could
be
predicated
of
everything
or
nothing
of
anything
to
these
difficulties
plato
finds
what
to
us
appears
to
be
the
answer
of
common
sense
that
is
the
relative
or
other
of
being
the
defining
and
distinguishing
principle
and
that
some
ideas
combine
with
others
but
not
all
with
all
it
is
remarkable
however
that
he
offers
this
obvious
reply
only
as
the
result
of
a
long
and
tedious
enquiry
by
a
great
effort
he
is
able
to
look
down
as
a
height
on
the
of
the
ideas
as
well
as
on
the
philosophies
yet
he
is
merely
asserting
principles
which
no
one
who
could
be
made
to
understand
them
would
deny
the
platonic
unity
of
differences
or
opposites
is
the
beginning
of
the
modern
view
that
all
knowledge
is
of
relations
it
also
anticipates
the
doctrine
of
spinoza
that
all
determination
is
negation
plato
takes
or
gives
so
much
of
either
of
these
theories
as
was
necessary
or
possible
in
the
age
in
which
he
lived
in
the
sophist
as
in
the
cratylus
he
is
opposed
to
the
heracleitean
flux
and
equally
to
the
megarian
and
cynic
denial
of
predication
because
he
regards
both
of
them
as
making
knowledge
impossible
he
does
not
assert
that
everything
is
and
is
not
or
that
the
same
thing
can
be
affected
in
the
same
and
in
opposite
ways
at
the
same
time
and
in
respect
of
the
same
part
of
itself
the
law
of
contradiction
is
as
clearly
laid
down
by
him
in
the
republic
as
by
aristotle
in
his
organon
yet
he
is
aware
that
in
the
negative
there
is
also
a
positive
element
and
that
oppositions
may
be
only
differences
and
in
the
parmenides
he
deduces
the
many
from
the
one
and
from
being
and
yet
shows
that
the
many
are
included
in
the
one
and
that
returns
to
being
in
several
of
the
later
dialogues
plato
is
occupied
with
the
connexion
of
the
sciences
which
in
the
philebus
he
divides
into
two
classes
of
pure
and
applied
adding
to
them
there
as
elsewhere
republic
states
a
superintending
science
of
dialectic
this
is
the
origin
of
aristotle
architectonic
which
seems
however
to
have
passed
into
an
imaginary
science
of
essence
and
no
longer
to
retain
any
relation
to
other
branches
of
knowledge
of
such
a
science
whether
described
as
prima
the
science
of
ousia
logic
or
metaphysics
philosophers
have
often
dreamed
but
even
now
the
time
has
not
arrived
when
the
anticipation
of
plato
can
be
realized
though
many
a
thinker
has
framed
a
of
the
sciences
no
one
has
as
yet
found
the
higher
science
which
arrays
them
in
harmonious
order
giving
to
the
organic
and
inorganic
to
the
physical
and
moral
their
respective
limits
and
showing
how
they
all
work
together
in
the
world
and
in
man
plato
arranges
in
order
the
stages
of
knowledge
and
of
existence
they
are
the
steps
or
grades
by
which
he
rises
from
sense
and
the
shadows
of
sense
to
the
idea
of
beauty
and
good
mind
is
in
motion
as
well
as
at
rest
soph
and
may
be
described
as
a
dialectical
progress
which
passes
from
one
limit
or
determination
of
thought
to
another
and
back
again
to
the
first
this
is
the
account
of
dialectic
given
by
plato
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
republic
which
regarded
under
another
aspect
is
the
mysticism
of
the
symposium
he
does
not
deny
the
existence
of
objects
of
sense
but
according
to
him
they
only
receive
their
true
meaning
when
they
are
incorporated
in
a
principle
which
is
above
them
republic
in
modern
language
they
might
be
said
to
come
first
in
the
order
of
experience
last
in
the
order
of
nature
and
reason
they
are
assumed
as
he
is
fond
of
repeating
upon
the
condition
that
they
shall
give
an
account
of
themselves
and
that
the
truth
of
their
existence
shall
be
hereafter
proved
for
philosophy
must
begin
somewhere
and
may
begin
anywhere
with
outward
objects
with
statements
of
opinion
with
abstract
principles
but
objects
of
sense
must
lead
us
onward
to
the
ideas
or
universals
which
are
contained
in
them
the
statements
of
opinion
must
be
verified
the
abstract
principles
must
be
filled
up
and
connected
with
one
another
in
plato
we
find
as
we
might
expect
the
germs
of
many
thoughts
which
have
been
further
developed
by
the
genius
of
spinoza
and
hegel
but
there
is
a
difficulty
in
separating
the
germ
from
the
flower
or
in
drawing
the
line
which
divides
ancient
from
modern
philosophy
many
coincidences
which
occur
in
them
are
unconscious
seeming
to
show
a
natural
tendency
in
the
human
mind
towards
certain
ideas
and
forms
of
thought
and
there
are
many
speculations
of
plato
which
would
have
passed
away
unheeded
and
their
meaning
like
that
of
some
hieroglyphic
would
have
remained
undeciphered
unless
two
thousand
years
and
more
afterwards
an
interpreter
had
arisen
of
a
kindred
spirit
and
of
the
same
intellectual
family
for
example
in
the
sophist
plato
begins
with
the
abstract
and
goes
on
to
the
concrete
not
in
the
lower
sense
of
returning
to
outward
objects
but
to
the
hegelian
concrete
or
unity
of
abstractions
in
the
intervening
period
hardly
any
importance
would
have
been
attached
to
the
question
which
is
so
full
of
meaning
to
plato
and
hegel
they
differ
however
in
their
manner
of
regarding
the
question
for
plato
is
answering
a
difficulty
he
is
seeking
to
justify
the
use
of
common
language
and
of
ordinary
thought
into
which
philosophy
had
introduced
a
principle
of
doubt
and
dissolution
whereas
hegel
tries
to
go
beyond
common
thought
and
to
combine
abstractions
in
a
higher
unity
the
ordinary
mechanism
of
language
and
logic
is
carried
by
him
into
another
region
in
which
all
oppositions
are
absorbed
and
all
contradictions
affirmed
only
that
they
may
be
done
away
with
but
plato
unlike
hegel
nowhere
bases
his
system
on
the
unity
of
opposites
although
in
the
parmenides
he
shows
an
hegelian
subtlety
in
the
analysis
of
one
and
being
it
is
difficult
within
the
compass
of
a
few
pages
to
give
even
a
faint
outline
of
the
hegelian
dialectic
no
philosophy
which
is
worth
understanding
can
be
understood
in
a
moment
common
sense
will
not
teach
us
metaphysics
any
more
than
mathematics
if
all
sciences
demand
of
us
protracted
study
and
attention
the
highest
of
all
can
hardly
be
matter
of
immediate
intuition
neither
can
we
appreciate
a
great
system
without
yielding
a
half
assent
to
it
like
flies
we
are
caught
in
the
web
and
we
can
only
judge
of
it
truly
when
we
place
ourselves
at
a
distance
from
it
of
all
philosophies
hegelianism
is
the
most
obscure
and
the
difficulty
inherent
in
the
subject
is
increased
by
the
use
of
a
technical
language
the
saying
of
socrates
respecting
the
writings
of
heracleitus
is
that
which
i
understand
and
that
which
i
do
not
understand
may
be
as
noble
but
the
strength
of
a
delian
diver
is
needed
to
swim
through
it
expresses
the
feeling
with
which
the
reader
rises
from
the
perusal
of
hegel
we
may
truly
apply
to
him
the
words
in
which
plato
describes
the
philosophers
went
on
his
way
rather
regardless
of
whether
we
understood
him
or
not
or
as
he
is
reported
himself
to
have
said
of
his
own
pupils
is
only
one
of
you
who
understands
me
and
he
does
not
understand
me
nevertheless
the
consideration
of
a
few
general
aspects
of
the
hegelian
philosophy
may
help
to
dispel
some
errors
and
to
awaken
an
interest
about
it
i
it
is
an
ideal
philosophy
which
in
popular
phraseology
maintains
not
matter
but
mind
to
be
the
truth
of
things
and
this
not
by
a
mere
crude
substitution
of
one
word
for
another
but
by
showing
either
of
them
to
be
the
complement
of
the
other
both
are
creations
of
thought
and
the
difference
in
kind
which
seems
to
divide
them
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
difference
of
degree
one
is
to
the
other
as
the
real
to
the
ideal
and
both
may
be
conceived
together
under
the
higher
form
of
the
notion
ii
under
another
aspect
it
views
all
the
forms
of
sense
and
knowledge
as
stages
of
thought
which
have
always
existed
implicitly
and
unconsciously
and
to
which
the
mind
of
the
world
gradually
disengaged
from
sense
has
become
awakened
the
present
has
been
the
past
the
succession
in
time
of
human
ideas
is
also
the
eternal
it
is
historical
and
also
a
divine
ideal
the
history
of
philosophy
stripped
of
personality
and
of
the
other
accidents
of
time
and
place
is
gathered
up
into
philosophy
and
again
philosophy
clothed
in
circumstance
expands
into
history
iii
whether
regarded
as
present
or
past
under
the
form
of
time
or
of
eternity
the
spirit
of
dialectic
is
always
moving
onwards
from
one
determination
of
thought
to
another
receiving
each
successive
system
of
philosophy
and
subordinating
it
to
that
which
follows
impelled
by
an
irresistible
necessity
from
one
idea
to
another
until
the
cycle
of
human
thought
and
existence
is
complete
it
follows
from
this
that
all
previous
philosophies
which
are
worthy
of
the
name
are
not
mere
opinions
or
speculations
but
stages
or
moments
of
thought
which
have
a
necessary
place
in
the
world
of
mind
they
are
no
longer
the
last
word
of
philosophy
for
another
and
another
has
succeeded
them
but
they
still
live
and
are
mighty
in
the
language
of
the
greek
poet
is
a
great
god
in
them
and
he
grows
not
old
iv
this
vast
ideal
system
is
supposed
to
be
based
upon
experience
at
each
step
it
professes
to
carry
with
it
the
of
eyes
and
ears
and
of
common
sense
as
well
as
the
internal
evidence
of
its
own
consistency
it
has
a
place
for
every
science
and
affirms
that
no
philosophy
of
a
narrower
type
is
capable
of
comprehending
all
true
facts
the
hegelian
dialectic
may
be
also
described
as
a
movement
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
beginning
with
the
generalizations
of
sense
passing
through
ideas
of
quality
quantity
measure
number
and
the
like
ascending
from
presentations
that
is
pictorial
forms
of
sense
to
representations
in
which
the
picture
vanishes
and
the
essence
is
detached
in
thought
from
the
outward
form
combining
the
i
and
the
or
the
subject
and
object
the
natural
order
of
thought
is
at
last
found
to
include
the
leading
ideas
of
the
sciences
and
to
arrange
them
in
relation
to
one
another
abstractions
grow
together
and
again
become
concrete
in
a
new
and
higher
sense
they
also
admit
of
development
from
within
their
own
spheres
everywhere
there
is
a
movement
of
attraction
and
repulsion
going
on
an
attraction
or
repulsion
of
ideas
of
which
the
physical
phenomenon
described
under
a
similar
name
is
a
figure
freedom
and
necessity
mind
and
matter
the
continuous
and
the
discrete
cause
and
effect
are
perpetually
being
severed
from
one
another
in
thought
only
to
be
perpetually
reunited
the
finite
and
infinite
the
absolute
and
relative
are
not
really
opposed
the
finite
and
the
negation
of
the
finite
are
alike
lost
in
a
higher
or
positive
infinity
and
the
absolute
is
the
sum
or
correlation
of
all
relatives
when
this
reconciliation
of
opposites
is
finally
completed
in
all
its
stages
the
mind
may
come
back
again
and
review
the
things
of
sense
the
opinions
of
philosophers
the
strife
of
theology
and
politics
without
being
disturbed
by
them
whatever
is
if
not
the
very
best
and
what
is
the
best
who
can
tell
is
at
any
rate
historical
and
rational
suitable
to
its
own
age
unsuitable
to
any
other
nor
can
any
efforts
of
speculative
thinkers
or
of
soldiers
and
statesmen
materially
quicken
the
of
the
suns
hegel
was
quite
sensible
how
great
would
be
the
difficulty
of
presenting
philosophy
to
mankind
under
the
form
of
opposites
most
of
us
live
in
the
truth
which
the
understanding
offers
to
us
and
if
occasionally
we
come
across
difficulties
like
the
controversy
of
necessity
and
or
the
eleatic
puzzle
of
achilles
and
the
tortoise
we
relegate
some
of
them
to
the
sphere
of
mystery
others
to
the
book
of
riddles
and
go
on
our
way
rejoicing
most
men
like
aristotle
have
been
accustomed
to
regard
a
contradiction
in
terms
as
the
end
of
strife
to
be
told
that
contradiction
is
the
life
and
mainspring
of
the
intellectual
world
is
indeed
a
paradox
to
them
every
abstraction
is
at
first
the
enemy
of
every
other
yet
they
are
linked
together
each
with
all
in
the
chain
of
being
the
struggle
for
existence
is
not
confined
to
the
animals
but
appears
in
the
kingdom
of
thought
the
divisions
which
arise
in
thought
between
the
physical
and
moral
and
between
the
moral
and
intellectual
and
the
like
are
deepened
and
widened
by
the
formal
logic
which
elevates
the
defects
of
the
human
faculties
into
laws
of
thought
they
become
a
part
of
the
mind
which
makes
them
and
is
also
made
up
of
them
such
distinctions
become
so
familiar
to
us
that
we
regard
the
thing
signified
by
them
as
absolutely
fixed
and
defined
these
are
some
of
the
illusions
from
which
hegel
delivers
us
by
placing
us
above
ourselves
by
teaching
us
to
analyze
the
growth
of
we
are
pleased
to
call
our
minds
by
reverting
to
a
time
when
our
present
distinctions
of
thought
and
language
had
no
existence
of
the
great
dislike
and
childish
impatience
of
his
system
which
would
be
aroused
among
his
opponents
he
was
fully
aware
and
would
often
anticipate
the
jests
which
the
rest
of
the
world
the
superfluity
of
their
wits
were
likely
to
make
upon
him
men
are
annoyed
at
what
puzzles
them
they
think
what
they
can
not
easily
understand
to
be
full
of
danger
many
a
sceptic
has
stood
as
he
supposed
firmly
rooted
in
the
categories
of
the
understanding
which
hegel
resolves
into
their
original
nothingness
for
like
plato
he
no
stone
in
the
intellectual
world
nor
can
we
deny
that
he
is
unnecessarily
difficult
or
that
his
own
mind
like
that
of
all
metaphysicians
was
too
much
under
the
dominion
of
his
system
and
unable
to
see
beyond
or
that
the
study
of
philosophy
if
made
a
serious
business
compare
republic
involves
grave
results
to
the
mind
and
life
of
the
student
for
it
may
encumber
him
without
enlightening
his
path
and
it
may
weaken
his
natural
faculties
of
thought
and
expression
without
increasing
his
philosophical
power
the
mind
easily
becomes
entangled
among
abstractions
and
loses
hold
of
facts
the
glass
which
is
adapted
to
distant
objects
takes
away
the
vision
of
what
is
near
and
present
to
us
to
hegel
as
to
the
ancient
greek
thinkers
philosophy
was
a
religion
a
principle
of
life
as
well
as
of
knowledge
like
the
idea
of
good
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
republic
a
cause
as
well
as
an
effect
the
source
of
growth
as
well
as
of
light
in
forms
of
thought
which
by
most
of
us
are
regarded
as
mere
categories
he
saw
or
thought
that
he
saw
a
gradual
revelation
of
the
divine
being
he
would
have
been
said
by
his
opponents
to
have
confused
god
with
the
history
of
philosophy
and
to
have
been
incapable
of
distinguishing
ideas
from
facts
and
certainly
we
can
scarcely
understand
how
a
deep
thinker
like
hegel
could
have
hoped
to
revive
or
supplant
the
old
traditional
faith
by
an
unintelligible
abstraction
or
how
he
could
have
imagined
that
philosophy
consisted
only
or
chiefly
in
the
categories
of
logic
for
abstractions
though
combined
by
him
in
the
notion
seem
to
be
never
really
concrete
they
are
a
metaphysical
anatomy
not
a
living
and
thinking
substance
though
we
are
reminded
by
him
again
and
again
that
we
are
gathering
up
the
world
in
ideas
we
feel
after
all
that
we
have
not
really
spanned
the
gulf
which
separates
phainomena
from
onta
having
in
view
some
of
these
difficulties
he
seeks
and
we
may
follow
his
example
to
make
the
understanding
of
his
system
easier
a
by
illustrations
and
b
by
pointing
out
the
coincidence
of
the
speculative
idea
and
the
historical
order
of
thought
a
if
we
ask
how
opposites
can
coexist
we
are
told
that
many
different
qualities
inhere
in
a
flower
or
a
tree
or
in
any
other
concrete
object
and
that
any
conception
of
space
or
matter
or
time
involves
the
two
contradictory
attributes
of
divisibility
and
continuousness
we
may
ponder
over
the
thought
of
number
reminding
ourselves
that
every
unit
both
implies
and
denies
the
existence
of
every
other
and
that
the
one
is
many
a
sum
of
fractions
and
the
many
one
a
sum
of
units
we
may
be
reminded
that
in
nature
there
is
a
centripetal
as
well
as
a
centrifugal
force
a
regulator
as
well
as
a
spring
a
law
of
attraction
as
well
as
of
repulsion
the
way
to
the
west
is
the
way
also
to
the
east
the
north
pole
of
the
magnet
can
not
be
divided
from
the
south
pole
two
minus
signs
make
a
plus
in
arithmetic
and
algebra
again
we
may
liken
the
successive
layers
of
thought
to
the
deposits
of
geological
strata
which
were
once
fluid
and
are
now
solid
which
were
at
one
time
uppermost
in
the
series
and
are
now
hidden
in
the
earth
or
to
the
successive
rinds
or
barks
of
trees
which
year
by
year
pass
inward
or
to
the
ripple
of
water
which
appears
and
reappears
in
an
circle
or
our
attention
may
be
drawn
to
ideas
which
the
moment
we
analyze
them
involve
a
contradiction
such
as
or
or
to
the
opposite
poles
as
they
are
sometimes
termed
of
necessity
and
freedom
of
idea
and
fact
we
may
be
told
to
observe
that
every
negative
is
a
positive
that
differences
of
kind
are
resolvable
into
differences
of
degree
and
that
differences
of
degree
may
be
heightened
into
differences
of
kind
we
may
remember
the
common
remark
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
a
question
we
may
be
recommended
to
look
within
and
to
explain
how
opposite
ideas
can
coexist
in
our
own
minds
and
we
may
be
told
to
imagine
the
minds
of
all
mankind
as
one
mind
in
which
the
true
ideas
of
all
ages
and
countries
inhere
in
our
conception
of
god
in
his
relation
to
man
or
of
any
union
of
the
divine
and
human
nature
a
contradiction
appears
to
be
unavoidable
is
not
the
reconciliation
of
mind
and
body
a
necessity
not
only
of
speculation
but
of
practical
life
reflections
such
as
these
will
furnish
the
best
preparation
and
give
the
right
attitude
of
mind
for
understanding
the
hegelian
philosophy
b
hegel
treatment
of
the
early
greek
thinkers
affords
the
readiest
illustration
of
his
meaning
in
conceiving
all
philosophy
under
the
form
of
opposites
the
first
abstraction
is
to
him
the
beginning
of
thought
hitherto
there
had
only
existed
a
tumultuous
chaos
of
mythological
fancy
but
when
thales
said
is
water
a
new
era
began
to
dawn
upon
the
world
man
was
seeking
to
grasp
the
universe
under
a
single
form
which
was
at
first
simply
a
material
element
the
most
equable
and
colourless
and
universal
which
could
be
found
but
soon
the
human
mind
became
dissatisfied
with
the
emblem
and
after
ringing
the
changes
on
one
element
after
another
demanded
a
more
abstract
and
perfect
conception
such
as
one
or
being
which
was
absolutely
at
rest
but
the
positive
had
its
negative
the
conception
of
being
involved
the
conception
of
one
many
the
conception
of
a
whole
parts
then
the
pendulum
swung
to
the
other
side
from
rest
to
motion
from
xenophanes
to
heracleitus
the
opposition
of
being
and
projected
into
space
became
the
atoms
and
void
of
leucippus
and
democritus
until
the
atomists
the
abstraction
of
the
individual
did
not
exist
in
the
philosophy
of
anaxagoras
the
idea
of
mind
whether
human
or
divine
was
beginning
to
be
realized
the
pendulum
gave
another
swing
from
the
individual
to
the
universal
from
the
object
to
the
subject
the
sophist
first
uttered
the
word
is
the
measure
of
all
things
which
socrates
presented
in
a
new
form
as
the
study
of
ethics
once
more
we
return
from
mind
to
the
object
of
mind
which
is
knowledge
and
out
of
knowledge
the
various
degrees
or
kinds
of
knowledge
more
or
less
abstract
were
gradually
developed
the
threefold
division
of
logic
physic
and
ethics
foreshadowed
in
plato
was
finally
established
by
aristotle
and
the
stoics
thus
according
to
hegel
in
the
course
of
about
two
centuries
by
a
process
of
antagonism
and
negation
the
leading
thoughts
of
philosophy
were
evolved
there
is
nothing
like
this
progress
of
opposites
in
plato
who
in
the
symposium
denies
the
possibility
of
reconciliation
until
the
opposition
has
passed
away
in
his
own
words
there
is
an
absurdity
in
supposing
that
is
discord
for
in
reality
harmony
consists
of
notes
of
a
higher
and
lower
pitch
which
disagreed
once
but
are
now
reconciled
by
the
art
of
music
he
does
indeed
describe
objects
of
sense
as
regarded
by
us
sometimes
from
one
point
of
view
and
sometimes
from
another
as
he
says
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
book
of
the
republic
is
nothing
light
which
is
not
heavy
or
great
which
is
not
small
and
he
extends
this
relativity
to
the
conceptions
of
just
and
good
as
well
as
to
great
and
small
in
like
manner
he
acknowledges
that
the
same
number
may
be
more
or
less
in
relation
to
other
numbers
without
any
increase
or
diminution
but
the
perplexity
only
arises
out
of
the
confusion
of
the
human
faculties
the
art
of
measuring
shows
us
what
is
truly
great
and
truly
small
though
the
just
and
good
in
particular
instances
may
vary
the
idea
of
good
is
eternal
and
unchangeable
and
the
idea
of
good
is
the
source
of
knowledge
and
also
of
being
in
which
all
the
stages
of
sense
and
knowledge
are
gathered
up
and
from
being
hypotheses
become
realities
leaving
the
comparison
with
plato
we
may
now
consider
the
value
of
this
invention
of
hegel
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
importance
of
showing
that
two
contraries
or
contradictories
may
in
certain
cases
be
both
true
the
silliness
of
the
laws
of
thought
a
a
or
in
the
negative
form
can
at
the
same
time
be
both
a
and
not
a
has
been
well
exposed
by
hegel
himself
wallace
hegel
who
remarks
that
form
of
the
maxim
is
virtually
for
a
proposition
implies
a
distinction
between
subject
and
predicate
whereas
the
maxim
of
identity
as
it
is
called
a
a
does
not
fulfil
what
its
form
requires
nor
does
any
mind
ever
think
or
form
conceptions
in
accordance
with
this
law
nor
does
any
existence
conform
to
it
wisdom
of
this
sort
is
well
parodied
in
shakespeare
twelfth
night
for
as
the
old
hermit
of
prague
that
never
saw
pen
and
ink
very
wittily
said
to
a
niece
of
king
gorboduc
that
that
is
is
for
what
is
that
but
that
and
is
but
is
unless
we
are
willing
to
admit
that
two
contradictories
may
be
true
many
questions
which
lie
at
the
threshold
of
mathematics
and
of
morals
will
be
insoluble
puzzles
to
us
the
influence
of
opposites
is
felt
in
practical
life
the
understanding
sees
one
side
of
a
question
only
the
common
sense
of
mankind
joins
one
of
two
parties
in
politics
in
religion
in
philosophy
yet
as
everybody
knows
truth
is
not
wholly
the
possession
of
either
but
the
characters
of
men
are
and
accept
this
or
that
aspect
of
the
truth
the
understanding
is
strong
in
a
single
abstract
principle
and
with
this
lever
moves
mankind
few
attain
to
a
balance
of
principles
or
recognize
truly
how
in
all
human
things
there
is
a
thesis
and
antithesis
a
law
of
action
and
of
reaction
in
politics
we
require
order
as
well
as
liberty
and
have
to
consider
the
proportions
in
which
under
given
circumstances
they
may
be
safely
combined
in
religion
there
is
a
tendency
to
lose
sight
of
morality
to
separate
goodness
from
the
love
of
truth
to
worship
god
without
attempting
to
know
him
in
philosophy
again
there
are
two
opposite
principles
of
immediate
experience
and
of
those
general
or
a
priori
truths
which
are
supposed
to
transcend
experience
but
the
common
sense
or
common
opinion
of
mankind
is
incapable
of
apprehending
these
opposite
sides
or
views
men
are
determined
by
their
natural
bent
to
one
or
other
of
them
they
go
straight
on
for
a
time
in
a
single
line
and
may
be
many
things
by
turns
but
not
at
once
hence
the
importance
of
familiarizing
the
mind
with
forms
which
will
assist
us
in
conceiving
or
expressing
the
complex
or
contrary
aspects
of
life
and
nature
the
danger
is
that
they
may
be
too
much
for
us
and
obscure
our
appreciation
of
facts
as
the
complexity
of
mechanics
can
not
be
understood
without
mathematics
so
neither
can
the
of
the
mental
and
moral
world
be
truly
apprehended
without
the
assistance
of
new
forms
of
thought
one
of
these
forms
is
the
unity
of
opposites
abstractions
have
a
great
power
over
us
but
they
are
apt
to
be
partial
and
and
only
when
modified
by
other
abstractions
do
they
make
an
approach
to
the
truth
many
a
man
has
become
a
fatalist
because
he
has
fallen
under
the
dominion
of
a
single
idea
he
says
to
himself
for
example
that
he
must
be
either
free
or
necessary
he
can
not
be
both
thus
in
the
ancient
world
whole
schools
of
philosophy
passed
away
in
the
vain
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
continuity
or
divisibility
of
matter
and
in
comparatively
modern
times
though
in
the
spirit
of
an
ancient
philosopher
bishop
berkeley
feeling
a
similar
perplexity
is
inclined
to
deny
the
truth
of
infinitesimals
in
mathematics
many
difficulties
arise
in
practical
religion
from
the
impossibility
of
conceiving
body
and
mind
at
once
and
in
adjusting
their
movements
to
one
another
there
is
a
border
ground
between
them
which
seems
to
belong
to
both
and
there
is
as
much
difficulty
in
conceiving
the
body
without
the
soul
as
the
soul
without
the
body
to
the
and
philosophy
is
either
a
or
not
a
should
at
least
be
added
the
clause
neither
both
the
double
form
makes
reflection
easier
and
more
conformable
to
experience
and
also
more
comprehensive
but
in
order
to
avoid
paradox
and
the
danger
of
giving
offence
to
the
unmetaphysical
part
of
mankind
we
may
speak
of
it
as
due
to
the
imperfection
of
language
or
the
limitation
of
human
faculties
it
is
nevertheless
a
discovery
which
in
platonic
language
may
be
termed
a
gracious
aid
to
thought
the
doctrine
of
opposite
moments
of
thought
or
of
progression
by
antagonism
further
assists
us
in
framing
a
scheme
or
system
of
the
sciences
the
negation
of
one
gives
birth
to
another
of
them
the
double
notions
are
the
joints
which
hold
them
together
the
simple
is
developed
into
the
complex
the
complex
returns
again
into
the
simple
beginning
with
the
highest
notion
of
mind
or
thought
we
may
descend
by
a
series
of
negations
to
the
first
generalizations
of
sense
or
again
we
may
begin
with
the
simplest
elements
of
sense
and
proceed
upwards
to
the
highest
being
or
thought
metaphysic
is
the
negation
or
absorption
of
physiology
physiology
of
chemistry
chemistry
of
mechanical
philosophy
similarly
in
mechanics
when
we
can
no
further
go
we
arrive
at
chemistry
when
chemistry
becomes
organic
we
arrive
at
physiology
when
we
pass
from
the
outward
and
animal
to
the
inward
nature
of
man
we
arrive
at
moral
and
metaphysical
philosophy
these
sciences
have
each
of
them
their
own
methods
and
are
pursued
independently
of
one
another
but
to
the
mind
of
the
thinker
they
are
all
one
latent
in
one
another
developed
out
of
one
another
this
method
of
opposites
has
supplied
new
instruments
of
thought
for
the
solution
of
metaphysical
problems
and
has
thrown
down
many
of
the
walls
within
which
the
human
mind
was
confined
formerly
when
philosophers
arrived
at
the
infinite
and
absolute
they
seemed
to
be
lost
in
a
region
beyond
human
comprehension
but
hegel
has
shown
that
the
absolute
and
infinite
are
no
more
true
than
the
relative
and
finite
and
that
they
must
alike
be
negatived
before
we
arrive
at
a
true
absolute
or
a
true
infinite
the
conceptions
of
the
infinite
and
absolute
as
ordinarily
understood
are
tiresome
because
they
are
unmeaning
but
there
is
no
peculiar
sanctity
or
mystery
in
them
we
might
as
well
make
an
infinitesimal
series
of
fractions
or
a
perpetually
recurring
decimal
the
object
of
our
worship
they
are
the
widest
and
also
the
thinnest
of
human
ideas
or
in
the
language
of
logicians
they
have
the
greatest
extension
and
the
least
comprehension
of
all
words
they
may
be
truly
said
to
be
the
most
inflated
with
a
false
meaning
they
have
been
handed
down
from
one
philosopher
to
another
until
they
have
acquired
a
religious
character
they
seem
also
to
derive
a
sacredness
from
their
association
with
the
divine
being
yet
they
are
the
poorest
of
the
predicates
under
which
we
describe
him
signifying
no
more
than
this
that
he
is
not
finite
that
he
is
not
relative
and
tending
to
obscure
his
higher
attributes
of
wisdom
goodness
truth
the
system
of
hegel
frees
the
mind
from
the
dominion
of
abstract
ideas
we
acknowledge
his
originality
and
some
of
us
delight
to
wander
in
the
mazes
of
thought
which
he
has
opened
to
us
for
hegel
has
found
admirers
in
england
and
scotland
when
his
popularity
in
germany
has
departed
and
he
like
the
philosophers
whom
he
criticizes
is
of
the
past
no
other
thinker
has
ever
dissected
the
human
mind
with
equal
patience
and
minuteness
he
has
lightened
the
burden
of
thought
because
he
has
shown
us
that
the
chains
which
we
wear
are
of
our
own
forging
to
be
able
to
place
ourselves
not
only
above
the
opinions
of
men
but
above
their
modes
of
thinking
is
a
great
height
of
philosophy
this
dearly
obtained
freedom
however
we
are
not
disposed
to
part
with
or
to
allow
him
to
build
up
in
a
new
form
the
elements
of
scholastic
logic
which
he
has
thrown
down
so
far
as
they
are
aids
to
reflection
and
expression
forms
of
thought
are
useful
but
no
further
we
may
easily
have
too
many
of
them
and
when
we
are
asked
to
believe
the
hegelian
to
be
the
sole
or
universal
logic
we
naturally
reply
that
there
are
other
ways
in
which
our
ideas
may
be
connected
the
triplets
of
hegel
the
division
into
being
essence
and
notion
are
not
the
only
or
necessary
modes
in
which
the
world
of
thought
can
be
conceived
there
may
be
an
evolution
by
degrees
as
well
as
by
opposites
the
word
suggests
the
possibility
of
resolving
all
differences
into
differences
of
quantity
again
the
opposites
themselves
may
vary
from
the
least
degree
of
diversity
up
to
contradictory
opposition
they
are
not
like
numbers
and
figures
always
and
everywhere
of
the
same
value
and
therefore
the
edifice
which
is
constructed
out
of
them
has
merely
an
imaginary
symmetry
and
is
really
irregular
and
out
of
proportion
the
spirit
of
hegelian
criticism
should
be
applied
to
his
own
system
and
the
terms
being
existence
essence
notion
and
the
like
challenged
and
defined
for
if
hegel
introduces
a
great
many
distinctions
he
obliterates
a
great
many
others
by
the
help
of
the
universal
solvent
not
which
appears
to
be
the
simplest
of
negations
and
yet
admits
of
several
meanings
neither
are
we
able
to
follow
him
in
the
play
of
metaphysical
fancy
which
conducts
him
from
one
determination
of
thought
to
another
but
we
begin
to
suspect
that
this
vast
system
is
not
god
within
us
or
god
immanent
in
the
world
and
may
be
only
the
invention
of
an
individual
brain
the
is
always
coming
back
upon
us
however
often
we
expel
it
we
do
not
easily
believe
that
we
have
within
the
compass
of
the
mind
the
form
of
universal
knowledge
we
rather
incline
to
think
that
the
method
of
knowledge
is
inseparable
from
actual
knowledge
and
wait
to
see
what
new
forms
may
be
developed
out
of
our
increasing
experience
and
observation
of
man
and
nature
we
are
conscious
of
a
being
who
is
without
us
as
well
as
within
us
even
if
inclined
to
pantheism
we
are
unwilling
to
imagine
that
the
meagre
categories
of
the
understanding
however
ingeniously
arranged
or
displayed
are
the
image
of
god
that
what
all
religions
were
seeking
after
from
the
beginning
was
the
hegelian
philosophy
which
has
been
revealed
in
the
latter
days
the
great
metaphysician
like
a
prophet
of
old
was
naturally
inclined
to
believe
that
his
own
thoughts
were
divine
realities
we
may
almost
say
that
whatever
came
into
his
head
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
necessary
truth
he
never
appears
to
have
criticized
himself
or
to
have
subjected
his
own
ideas
to
the
process
of
analysis
which
he
applies
to
every
other
philosopher
hegel
would
have
insisted
that
his
philosophy
should
be
accepted
as
a
whole
or
not
at
all
he
would
have
urged
that
the
parts
derived
their
meaning
from
one
another
and
from
the
whole
he
thought
that
he
had
supplied
an
outline
large
enough
to
contain
all
future
knowledge
and
a
method
to
which
all
future
philosophies
must
conform
his
metaphysical
genius
is
especially
shown
in
the
construction
of
the
categories
a
work
which
was
only
begun
by
kant
and
elaborated
to
the
utmost
by
himself
but
is
it
really
true
that
the
part
has
no
meaning
when
separated
from
the
whole
or
that
knowledge
to
be
knowledge
at
all
must
be
universal
do
all
abstractions
shine
only
by
the
reflected
light
of
other
abstractions
may
they
not
also
find
a
nearer
explanation
in
their
relation
to
phenomena
if
many
of
them
are
correlatives
they
are
not
all
so
and
the
relations
which
subsist
between
them
vary
from
a
mere
association
up
to
a
necessary
connexion
nor
is
it
easy
to
determine
how
far
the
unknown
element
affects
the
known
whether
for
example
new
discoveries
may
not
one
day
supersede
our
most
elementary
notions
about
nature
to
a
certain
extent
all
our
knowledge
is
conditional
upon
what
may
be
known
in
future
ages
of
the
world
we
must
admit
this
hypothetical
element
which
we
can
not
get
rid
of
by
an
assumption
that
we
have
already
discovered
the
method
to
which
all
philosophy
must
conform
hegel
is
right
in
preferring
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
in
setting
actuality
before
possibility
in
excluding
from
the
philosopher
vocabulary
the
word
but
he
is
too
well
satisfied
with
his
own
system
ever
to
consider
the
effect
of
what
is
unknown
on
the
element
which
is
known
to
the
hegelian
all
things
are
plain
and
clear
while
he
who
is
outside
the
charmed
circle
is
in
the
mire
of
ignorance
and
impurity
he
who
is
within
is
omniscient
or
at
least
has
all
the
elements
of
knowledge
under
his
hand
hegelianism
may
be
said
to
be
a
transcendental
defence
of
the
world
as
it
is
there
is
no
room
for
aspiration
and
no
need
of
any
is
actual
is
rational
what
is
rational
is
actual
but
a
good
man
will
not
readily
acquiesce
in
this
aphorism
he
knows
of
course
that
all
things
proceed
according
to
law
whether
for
good
or
evil
but
when
he
sees
the
misery
and
ignorance
of
mankind
he
is
convinced
that
without
any
interruption
of
the
uniformity
of
nature
the
condition
of
the
world
may
be
indefinitely
improved
by
human
effort
there
is
also
an
adaptation
of
persons
to
times
and
countries
but
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
fulfilment
of
their
higher
natures
the
man
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
unfitted
for
the
eighteenth
and
the
man
of
the
eighteenth
for
the
nineteenth
and
most
of
us
would
be
out
of
place
in
the
world
of
a
hundred
years
hence
but
all
higher
minds
are
much
more
akin
than
they
are
different
genius
is
of
all
ages
and
there
is
perhaps
more
uniformity

more
meet
in
a
higher
sphere
above
the
ordinary
ways
of
men
they
understand
one
another
from
afar
notwithstanding
the
interval
which
separates
them
they
are
spectators
of
all
time
and
of
all
existence
their
works
live
for
ever
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
force
of
their
individuality
breaking
through
the
uniformity
which
surrounds
them
but
such
disturbers
of
the
order
of
thought
hegel
is
reluctant
to
acknowledge
the
doctrine
of
hegel
will
to
many
seem
the
expression
of
an
indolent
conservatism
and
will
at
any
rate
be
made
an
excuse
for
it
the
mind
of
the
patriot
rebels
when
he
is
told
that
the
worst
tyranny
and
oppression
has
a
natural
fitness
he
can
not
be
persuaded
for
example
that
the
conquest
of
prussia
by
napoleon
was
either
natural
or
necessary
or
that
any
similar
calamity
befalling
a
nation
should
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
poet
or
philosopher
we
may
need
such
a
philosophy
or
religion
to
console
us
under
evils
which
are
irremediable
but
we
see
that
it
is
fatal
to
the
higher
life
of
man
it
seems
to
say
to
us
world
is
a
vast
system
or
machine
which
can
be
conceived
under
the
forms
of
logic
but
in
which
no
single
man
can
do
any
great
good
or
any
great
harm
even
if
it
were
a
thousand
times
worse
than
it
is
it
could
be
arranged
in
categories
and
explained
by
philosophers
and
what
more
do
we
want
the
philosophy
of
hegel
appeals
to
an
historical
criterion
the
ideas
of
men
have
a
succession
in
time
as
well
as
an
order
of
thought
but
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
correspondence
between
the
succession
of
ideas
in
history
and
the
natural
order
of
philosophy
is
hardly
true
even
of
the
beginnings
of
thought
and
in
later
systems
forms
of
thought
are
too
numerous
and
complex
to
admit
of
our
tracing
in
them
a
regular
succession
they
seem
also
to
be
in
part
reflections
of
the
past
and
it
is
difficult
to
separate
in
them
what
is
original
and
what
is
borrowed
doubtless
they
have
a
relation
to
one
another
the
transition
from
descartes
to
spinoza
or
from
locke
to
berkeley
is
not
a
matter
of
chance
but
it
can
hardly
be
described
as
an
alternation
of
opposites
or
figured
to
the
mind
by
the
vibrations
of
a
pendulum
even
in
aristotle
and
plato
rightly
understood
we
can
not
trace
this
law
of
action
and
reaction
they
are
both
idealists
although
to
the
one
the
idea
is
actual
and
immanent
to
the
other
only
potential
and
transcendent
as
hegel
himself
has
pointed
out
wallace
hegel
the
true
meaning
of
aristotle
has
been
disguised
from
us
by
his
own
appeal
to
fact
and
the
opinions
of
mankind
in
his
more
popular
works
and
by
the
use
made
of
his
writings
in
the
middle
ages
no
book
except
the
scriptures
has
been
so
much
read
and
so
little
understood
the
philosophies
are
simpler
and
we
may
observe
a
progress
in
them
but
is
there
any
regular
succession
the
ideas
of
being
change
number
seem
to
have
sprung
up
contemporaneously
in
different
parts
of
greece
and
we
have
no
difficulty
in
constructing
them
out
of
one
another
we
can
see
that
the
union
of
being
and
gave
birth
to
the
idea
of
change
or
becoming
and
that
one
might
be
another
aspect
of
being
again
the
eleatics
may
be
regarded
as
developing
in
one
direction
into
the
megarian
school
in
the
other
into
the
atomists
but
there
is
no
necessary
connexion
between
them
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
the
deficiency
which
was
felt
in
one
school
was
supplemented
or
compensated
by
another
they
were
all
efforts
to
supply
the
want
which
the
greeks
began
to
feel
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
before
christ
the
want
of
abstract
ideas
nor
must
we
forget
the
uncertainty
of
chronology
if
as
aristotle
says
there
were
atomists
before
leucippus
eleatics
before
xenophanes
and
perhaps
of
the
flux
before
heracleitus
hegel
order
of
thought
in
the
history
of
philosophy
would
be
as
much
disarranged
as
his
order
of
religious
thought
by
recent
discoveries
in
the
history
of
religion
hegel
is
fond
of
repeating
that
all
philosophies
still
live
and
that
the
earlier
are
preserved
in
the
later
they
are
refuted
and
they
are
not
refuted
by
those
who
succeed
them
once
they
reigned
supreme
now
they
are
subordinated
to
a
power
or
idea
greater
or
more
comprehensive
than
their
own
the
thoughts
of
socrates
and
plato
and
aristotle
have
certainly
sunk
deep
into
the
mind
of
the
world
and
have
exercised
an
influence
which
will
never
pass
away
but
can
we
say
that
they
have
the
same
meaning
in
modern
and
ancient
philosophy
some
of
them
as
for
example
the
words
either
have
become
obsolete
or
are
used
in
new
senses
whereas
have
acquired
an
exaggerated
importance
is
the
manner
in
which
the
logical
determinations
of
thought
or
as
they
may
be
termed
have
been
handed
down
to
us
really
different
from
that
in
which
other
words
have
come
down
to
us
have
they
not
been
equally
subject
to
accident
and
are
they
not
often
used
by
hegel
himself
in
senses
which
would
have
been
quite
unintelligible
to
their
original
inventors
as
for
example
when
he
speaks
of
the
of
leibnitz
has
a
sufficient
ground
as
identical
with
his
own
doctrine
of
the
wallace
hegel
or
the
and
of
heracleitus
as
the
same
with
his
own
as
the
historical
order
of
thought
has
been
adapted
to
the
logical
so
we
have
reason
for
suspecting
that
the
hegelian
logic
has
been
in
some
degree
adapted
to
the
order
of
thought
in
history
there
is
unfortunately
no
criterion
to
which
either
of
them
can
be
subjected
and
not
much
forcing
was
required
to
bring
either
into
near
relations
with
the
other
we
may
fairly
doubt
whether
the
division
of
the
first
and
second
parts
of
logic
in
the
hegelian
system
has
not
really
arisen
from
a
desire
to
make
them
accord
with
the
first
and
second
stages
of
the
early
greek
philosophy
is
there
any
reason
why
the
conception
of
measure
in
the
first
part
which
is
formed
by
the
union
of
quality
and
quantity
should
not
have
been
equally
placed
in
the
second
division
of
mediate
or
reflected
ideas
the
more
we
analyze
them
the
less
exact
does
the
coincidence
of
philosophy
and
the
history
of
philosophy
appear
many
terms
which
were
used
absolutely
in
the
beginning
of
philosophy
such
as
and
the
like
became
relative
in
the
subsequent
history
of
thought
but
hegel
employs
some
of
them
absolutely
some
relatively
seemingly
without
any
principle
and
without
any
regard
to
their
original
significance
the
divisions
of
the
hegelian
logic
bear
a
superficial
resemblance
to
the
divisions
of
the
scholastic
logic
the
first
part
answers
to
the
term
the
second
to
the
proposition
the
third
to
the
syllogism
these
are
the
grades
of
thought
under
which
we
conceive
the
world
first
in
the
general
terms
of
quality
quantity
measure
secondly
under
the
relative
forms
of
and
existence
substance
and
accidents
and
the
like
thirdly
in
syllogistic
forms
of
the
individual
mediated
with
the
universal
by
the
help
of
the
particular
of
syllogisms
there
are
various
kinds
qualitative
quantitative
inductive
mechanical
teleological
which
are
developed
out
of
one
another
but
is
there
any
meaning
in
reintroducing
the
forms
of
the
old
logic
who
ever
thinks
of
the
world
as
a
syllogism
what
connexion
is
there
between
the
proposition
and
our
ideas
of
reciprocity
cause
and
effect
and
similar
relations
it
is
difficult
enough
to
conceive
all
the
powers
of
nature
and
mind
gathered
up
in
one
the
difficulty
is
greatly
increased
when
the
new
is
confused
with
the
old
and
the
common
logic
is
the
procrustes
bed
into
which
they
are
forced
the
hegelian
philosophy
claims
as
we
have
seen
to
be
based
upon
experience
it
abrogates
the
distinction
of
a
priori
and
a
posteriori
truth
it
also
acknowledges
that
many
differences
of
kind
are
resolvable
into
differences
of
degree
it
is
familiar
with
the
terms
and
the
like
yet
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
considered
the
forms
of
thought
which
are
best
adapted
for
the
expression
of
facts
it
has
never
applied
the
categories
to
experience
it
has
not
defined
the
differences
in
our
ideas
of
opposition
or
development
or
cause
and
effect
in
the
different
sciences
which
make
use
of
these
terms
it
rests
on
a
knowledge
which
is
not
the
result
of
exact
or
serious
enquiry
but
is
floating
in
the
air
the
mind
has
been
imperceptibly
informed
of
some
of
the
methods
required
in
the
sciences
hegel
boasts
that
the
movement
of
dialectic
is
at
once
necessary
and
spontaneous
in
reality
it
goes
beyond
experience
and
is
unverified
by
it
further
the
hegelian
philosophy
while
giving
us
the
power
of
thinking
a
great
deal
more
than
we
are
able
to
fill
up
seems
to
be
wanting
in
some
determinations
of
thought
which
we
require
we
can
not
say
that
physical
science
which
at
present
occupies
so
large
a
share
of
popular
attention
has
been
made
easier
or
more
intelligible
by
the
distinctions
of
hegel
nor
can
we
deny
that
he
has
sometimes
interpreted
physics
by
metaphysics
and
confused
his
own
philosophical
fancies
with
the
laws
of
nature
the
very
freedom
of
the
movement
is
not
without
suspicion
seeming
to
imply
a
state
of
the
human
mind
which
has
entirely
lost
sight
of
facts
nor
can
the
necessity
which
is
attributed
to
it
be
very
stringent
seeing
that
the
successive
categories
or
determinations
of
thought
in
different
parts
of
his
writings
are
arranged
by
the
philosopher
in
different
ways
what
is
termed
necessary
evolution
seems
to
be
only
the
order
in
which
a
succession
of
ideas
presented
themselves
to
the
mind
of
hegel
at
a
particular
time
the
nomenclature
of
hegel
has
been
made
by
himself
out
of
the
language
of
common
life
he
uses
a
few
words
only
which
are
borrowed
from
his
predecessors
or
from
the
greek
philosophy
and
these
generally
in
a
sense
peculiar
to
himself
the
first
stage
of
his
philosophy
answers
to
the
word
the
second
to
the
word
been
the
third
to
the
words
been
and
combined
in
other
words
the
first
sphere
is
immediate
the
second
mediated
by
reflection
the
third
or
highest
returns
into
the
first
and
is
both
mediate
and
immediate
as
bible
was
written
in
the
language
of
the
common
people
so
hegel
seems
to
have
thought
that
he
gave
his
philosophy
a
truly
german
character
by
the
use
of
idiomatic
german
words
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
attempt
has
been
successful
first
because
such
words
as
sich
seyn
sich
seyn
und
fur
sich
seyn
though
the
simplest
combinations
of
nouns
and
verbs
require
a
difficult
and
elaborate
explanation
the
simplicity
of
the
words
contrasts
with
the
hardness
of
their
meaning
secondly
the
use
of
technical
phraseology
necessarily
separates
philosophy
from
general
literature
the
student
has
to
learn
a
new
language
of
uncertain
meaning
which
he
with
difficulty
remembers
no
former
philosopher
had
ever
carried
the
use
of
technical
terms
to
the
same
extent
as
hegel
the
language
of
plato
or
even
of
aristotle
is
but
slightly
removed
from
that
of
common
life
and
was
introduced
naturally
by
a
series
of
thinkers
the
language
of
the
scholastic
logic
has
become
technical
to
us
but
in
the
middle
ages
was
the
vernacular
latin
of
priests
and
students
the
higher
spirit
of
philosophy
the
spirit
of
plato
and
socrates
rebels
against
the
hegelian
use
of
language
as
mechanical
and
technical
hegel
is
fond
of
etymologies
and
often
seems
to
trifle
with
words
he
gives
etymologies
which
are
bad
and
never
considers
that
the
meaning
of
a
word
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
derivation
he
lived
before
the
days
of
comparative
philology
or
of
comparative
mythology
and
religion
which
would
have
opened
a
new
world
to
him
he
makes
no
allowance
for
the
element
of
chance
either
in
language
or
thought
and
perhaps
there
is
no
greater
defect
in
his
system
than
the
want
of
a
sound
theory
of
language
he
speaks
as
if
thought
instead
of
being
identical
with
language
was
wholly
independent
of
it
it
is
not
the
actual
growth
of
the
mind
but
the
imaginary
growth
of
the
hegelian
system
which
is
attractive
to
him
neither
are
we
able
to
say
why
of
the
common
forms
of
thought
some
are
rejected
by
him
while
others
have
an
undue
prominence
given
to
them
some
of
them
such
as
and
have
hardly
any
basis
either
in
language
or
philosophy
while
others
such
as
and
are
but
slightly
considered
all
abstractions
are
supposed
by
hegel
to
derive
their
meaning
from
one
another
this
is
true
of
some
but
not
of
all
and
in
different
degrees
there
is
an
explanation
of
abstractions
by
the
phenomena
which
they
represent
as
well
as
by
their
relation
to
other
abstractions
if
the
knowledge
of
all
were
necessary
to
the
knowledge
of
any
one
of
them
the
mind
would
sink
under
the
load
of
thought
again
in
every
process
of
reflection
we
seem
to
require
a
standing
ground
and
in
the
attempt
to
obtain
a
complete
analysis
we
lose
all
fixedness
if
for
example
the
mind
is
viewed
as
the
complex
of
ideas
or
the
difference
between
things
and
persons
denied
such
an
analysis
may
be
justified
from
the
point
of
view
of
hegel
but
we
shall
find
that
in
the
attempt
to
criticize
thought
we
have
lost
the
power
of
thinking
and
like
the
heracliteans
of
old
have
no
words
in
which
our
meaning
can
be
expressed
such
an
analysis
may
be
of
value
as
a
corrective
of
popular
language
or
thought
but
should
still
allow
us
to
retain
the
fundamental
distinctions
of
philosophy
in
the
hegelian
system
ideas
supersede
persons
the
world
of
thought
though
sometimes
described
as
spirit
or
is
really
impersonal
the
minds
of
men
are
to
be
regarded
as
one
mind
or
more
correctly
as
a
succession
of
ideas
any
comprehensive
view
of
the
world
must
necessarily
be
general
and
there
may
be
a
use
with
a
view
to
comprehensiveness
in
dropping
individuals
and
their
lives
and
actions
in
all
things
if
we
leave
out
details
a
certain
degree
of
order
begins
to
appear
at
any
rate
we
can
make
an
order
which
with
a
little
exaggeration
or
disproportion
in
some
of
the
parts
will
cover
the
whole
field
of
philosophy
but
are
we
therefore
justified
in
saying
that
ideas
are
the
causes
of
the
great
movement
of
the
world
rather
than
the
personalities
which
conceived
them
the
great
man
is
the
expression
of
his
time
and
there
may
be
peculiar
difficulties
in
his
age
which
he
can
not
overcome
he
may
be
out
of
harmony
with
his
circumstances
too
early
or
too
late
and
then
all
his
thoughts
perish
his
genius
passes
away
unknown
but
not
therefore
is
he
to
be
regarded
as
a
mere
waif
or
stray
in
human
history
any
more
than
he
is
the
mere
creature
or
expression
of
the
age
in
which
he
lives
his
ideas
are
inseparable
from
himself
and
would
have
been
nothing
without
him
through
a
thousand
personal
influences
they
have
been
brought
home
to
the
minds
of
others
he
starts
from
antecedents
but
he
is
great
in
proportion
as
he
disengages
himself
from
them
or
absorbs
himself
in
them
moreover
the
types
of
greatness
differ
while
one
man
is
the
expression
of
the
influences
of
his
age
another
is
in
antagonism
to
them
one
man
is
borne
on
the
surface
of
the
water
another
is
carried
forward
by
the
current
which
flows
beneath
the
character
of
an
individual
whether
he
be
independent
of
circumstances
or
not
inspires
others
quite
as
much
as
his
words
what
is
the
teaching
of
socrates
apart
from
his
personal
history
or
the
doctrines
of
christ
apart
from
the
divine
life
in
which
they
are
embodied
has
not
hegel
himself
delineated
the

would
have
been

that
we
most
value
in
knowledge
or
in
life
and
can
that
be
a
true
theory
of
the
history
of
philosophy
which
in
hegel
own
language
not
allow
the
individual
to
have
his
right
once
more
while
we
readily
admit
that
the
world
is
relative
to
the
mind
and
the
mind
to
the
world
and
that
we
must
suppose
a
common
or
correlative
growth
in
them
we
shrink
from
saying
that
this
complex
nature
can
contain
even
in
outline
all
the
endless
forms
of
being
and
knowledge
are
we
not
the
living
among
the
dead
and
dignifying
a
mere
logical
skeleton
with
the
name
of
philosophy
and
almost
of
god
when
we
look
far
away
into
the
primeval
sources
of
thought
and
belief
do
we
suppose
that
the
mere
accident
of
our
being
the
heirs
of
the
greek
philosophers
can
give
us
a
right
to
set
ourselves
up
as
having
the
true
and
only
standard
of
reason
in
the
world
or
when
we
contemplate
the
infinite
worlds
in
the
expanse
of
heaven
can
we
imagine
that
a
few
meagre
categories
derived
from
language
and
invented
by
the
genius
of
one
or
two
great
thinkers
contain
the
secret
of
the
universe
or
having
regard
to
the
ages
during
which
the
human
race
may
yet
endure
do
we
suppose
that
we
can
anticipate
the
proportions
human
knowledge
may
attain
even
within
the
short
space
of
one
or
two
thousand
years
again
we
have
a
difficulty
in
understanding
how
ideas
can
be
causes
which
to
us
seems
to
be
as
much
a
figure
of
speech
as
the
old
notion
of
a
creator
artist
makes
the
world
by
the
help
of
the
plato
tim
or
with
golden
pair
of
compasses
measures
out
the
circumference
of
the
universe
milton
we
can
understand
how
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
an
inventor
is
the
cause
of
the
work
which
is
produced
by
it
and
we
can
dimly
imagine
how
this
universal
frame
may
be
animated
by
a
divine
intelligence
but
we
can
not
conceive
how
all
the
thoughts
of
men
that
ever
were
which
are
themselves
subject
to
so
many
external
conditions
of
climate
country
and
the
like
even
if
regarded
as
the
single
thought
of
a
divine
being
can
be
supposed
to
have
made
the
world
we
appear
to
be
only
wrapping
up
ourselves
in
our
own
conceits
to
be
confusing
cause
and
effect
to
be
losing
the
distinction
between
reflection
and
action
between
the
human
and
divine
these
are
some
of
the
doubts
and
suspicions
which
arise
in
the
mind
of
a
student
of
hegel
when
after
living
for
a
time
within
the
charmed
circle
he
removes
to
a
little
distance
and
looks
back
upon
what
he
has
learnt
from
the
of
history
and
experience
the
enthusiasm
of
his
youth
has
passed
away
the
authority
of
the
master
no
longer
retains
a
hold
upon
him
but
he
does
not
regret
the
time
spent
in
the
study
of
him
he
finds
that
he
has
received
from
him
a
real
enlargement
of
mind
and
much
of
the
true
spirit
of
philosophy
even
when
he
has
ceased
to
believe
in
him
he
returns
again
and
again
to
his
writings
as
to
the
recollections
of
a
first
love
not
undeserving
of
his
admiration
still
perhaps
if
he
were
asked
how
he
can
admire
without
believing
or
what
value
he
can
attribute
to
what
he
knows
to
be
erroneous
he
might
answer
in
some
such
manner
as
the
following
that
in
hegel
he
finds
glimpses
of
the
genius
of
the
poet
and
of
the
common
sense
of
the
man
of
the
world
his
system
is
not
cast
in
a
poetic
form
but
neither
has
all
this
load
of
logic
extinguished
in
him
the
feeling
of
poetry
he
is
the
true
countryman
of
his
contemporaries
goethe
and
schiller
many
fine
expressions
are
scattered
up
and
down
in
his
writings
as
when
he
tells
us
that
crusaders
went
to
the
sepulchre
but
found
it
empty
he
delights
to
find
vestiges
of
his
own
philosophy
in
the
older
german
mystics
and
though
he
can
be
scarcely
said
to
have
mixed
much
in
the
affairs
of
men
for
as
his
biographer
tells
us
lived
for
thirty
years
in
a
single
room
yet
he
is
far
from
being
ignorant
of
the
world
no
one
can
read
his
writings
without
acquiring
an
insight
into
life
he
loves
to
touch
with
the
spear
of
logic
the
follies
and
of
mankind
and
make
them
appear
in
their
natural
form
stripped
of
the
disguises
of
language
and
custom
he
will
not
allow
men
to
defend
themselves
by
an
appeal
to
or
abstract
principles
in
this
age
of
reason
any
one
can
too
easily
find
a
reason
for
doing
what
he
likes
wallace
he
is
suspicious
of
a
distinction
which
is
often
made
between
a
person
character
and
his
conduct
his
spirit
is
the
opposite
of
that
of
jesuitism
or
casuistry
wallace
he
affords
an
example
of
a
remark
which
has
been
often
made
that
in
order
to
know
the
world
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
had
a
great
experience
of
it
hegel
if
not
the
greatest
philosopher
is
certainly
the
greatest
critic
of
philosophy
who
ever
lived
no
one
else
has
equally
mastered
the
opinions
of
his
predecessors
or
traced
the
connexion
of
them
in
the
same
manner
no
one
has
equally
raised
the
human
mind
above
the
trivialities
of
the
common
logic
and
the
unmeaningness
of
abstractions
and
above
imaginary
possibilities
which
as
he
truly
says
have
no
place
in
philosophy
no
one
has
won
so
much
for
the
kingdom
of
ideas
whatever
may
be
thought
of
his
own
system
it
will
hardly
be
denied
that
he
has
overthrown
locke
kant
hume
and
the
philosophy
of
common
sense
he
shows
us
that
only
by
the
study
of
metaphysics
can
we
get
rid
of
metaphysics
and
that
those
who
are
in
theory
most
opposed
to
them
are
in
fact
most
entirely
and
hopelessly
enslaved
by
them
reinen
physiker
sind
nur
die
thiere
the
disciple
of
hegel
will
hardly
become
the
slave
of
any
other
what
bacon
seems
to
promise
him
he
will
find
realized
in
the
great
german
thinker
an
emancipation
nearly
complete
from
the
influences
of
the
scholastic
logic
many
of
those
who
are
least
disposed
to
become
the
votaries
of
hegelianism
nevertheless
recognize
in
his
system
a
new
logic
supplying
a
variety
of
instruments
and
methods
hitherto
unemployed
we
may
not
be
able
to
agree
with
him
in
assimilating
the
natural
order
of
human
thought
with
the
history
of
philosophy
and
still
less
in
identifying
both
with
the
divine
idea
or
nature
but
we
may
acknowledge
that
the
great
thinker
has
thrown
a
light
on
many
parts
of
human
knowledge
and
has
solved
many
difficulties
we
can
not
receive
his
doctrine
of
opposites
as
the
last
word
of
philosophy
but
still
we
may
regard
it
as
a
very
important
contribution
to
logic
we
can
not
affirm
that
words
have
no
meaning
when
taken
out
of
their
connexion
in
the
history
of
thought
but
we
recognize
that
their
meaning
is
to
a
great
extent
due
to
association
and
to
their
correlation
with
one
another
we
see
the
advantage
of
viewing
in
the
concrete
what
mankind
regard
only
in
the
abstract
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
his
faith
or
conviction
that
god
is
immanent
in
the
world
within
the
sphere
of
the
human
mind
and
not
beyond
it
it
was
natural
that
he
himself
like
a
prophet
of
old
should
regard
the
philosophy
which
he
had
invented
as
the
voice
of
god
in
man
but
this
by
no
means
implies
that
he
conceived
himself
as
creating
god
in
thought
he
was
the
servant
of
his
own
ideas
and
not
the
master
of
them
the
philosophy
of
history
and
the
history
of
philosophy
may
be
almost
said
to
have
been
discovered
by
him
he
has
done
more
to
explain
greek
thought
than
all
other
writers
put
together
many
ideas
of
development
evolution
reciprocity
which
have
become
the
symbols
of
another
school
of
thinkers
may
be
traced
to
his
speculations
in
the
theology
and
philosophy
of
england
as
well
as
of
germany
and
also
in
the
lighter
literature
of
both
countries
there
are
always
appearing
of
the
great
banquet
of
hegel
sophist
persons
of
the
dialogue
theodorus
theaetetus
socrates
an
eleatic
stranger
whom
theodorus
and
theaetetus
bring
with
them
the
younger
socrates
who
is
a
silent
auditor
theodorus
here
we
are
socrates
true
to
our
agreement
of
yesterday
and
we
bring
with
us
a
stranger
from
elea
who
is
a
disciple
of
parmenides
and
zeno
and
a
true
philosopher
socrates
is
he
not
rather
a
god
theodorus
who
comes
to
us
in
the
disguise
of
a
stranger
for
homer
says
that
all
the
gods
and
especially
the
god
of
strangers
are
companions
of
the
meek
and
just
and
visit
the
good
and
evil
among
men
and
may
not
your
companion
be
one
of
those
higher
powers
a
deity
who
has
come
to
spy
out
our
weakness
in
argument
and
to
us
theodorus
nay
socrates
he
is
not
one
of
the
disputatious
sort
he
is
too
good
for
that
and
in
my
opinion
he
is
not
a
god
at
all
but
divine
he
certainly
is
for
this
is
a
title
which
i
should
give
to
all
philosophers
socrates
capital
my
friend
and
i
may
add
that
they
are
almost
as
hard
to
be
discerned
as
the
gods
for
the
true
philosophers
and
such
as
are
not
merely
made
up
for
the
occasion
appear
in
various
forms
unrecognized
by
the
ignorance
of
men
and
they
about
cities
as
homer
declares
looking
from
above
upon
human
life
and
some
think
nothing
of
them
and
others
can
never
think
enough
and
sometimes
they
appear
as
statesmen
and
sometimes
as
sophists
and
then
again
to
many
they
seem
to
be
no
better
than
madmen
i
should
like
to
ask
our
eleatic
friend
if
he
would
tell
us
what
is
thought
about
them
in
italy
and
to
whom
the
terms
are
applied
theodorus
what
terms
socrates
sophist
statesman
philosopher
theodorus
what
is
your
difficulty
about
them
and
what
made
you
ask
socrates
i
want
to
know
whether
by
his
countrymen
they
are
regarded
as
one
or
two
or
do
they
as
the
names
are
three
distinguish
also
three
kinds
and
assign
one
to
each
name
theodorus
i
dare
say
that
the
stranger
will
not
object
to
discuss
the
question
what
do
you
say
stranger
stranger
i
am
far
from
objecting
theodorus
nor
have
i
any
difficulty
in
replying
that
by
us
they
are
regarded
as
three
but
to
define
precisely
the
nature
of
each
of
them
is
by
no
means
a
slight
or
easy
task
theodorus
you
have
happened
to
light
socrates
almost
on
the
very
question
which
we
were
asking
our
friend
before
we
came
hither
and
he
excused
himself
to
us
as
he
does
now
to
you
although
he
admitted
that
the
matter
had
been
fully
discussed
and
that
he
remembered
the
answer
socrates
then
do
not
stranger
deny
us
the
first
favour
which
we
ask
of
you
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
and
therefore
i
shall
only
beg
of
you
to
say
whether
you
like
and
are
accustomed
to
make
a
long
oration
on
a
subject
which
you
want
to
explain
to
another
or
to
proceed
by
the
method
of
question
and
answer
i
remember
hearing
a
very
noble
discussion
in
which
parmenides
employed
the
latter
of
the
two
methods
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
he
was
far
advanced
in
years
compare
parm
stranger
i
prefer
to
talk
with
another
when
he
responds
pleasantly
and
is
light
in
hand
if
not
i
would
rather
have
my
own
say
socrates
any
one
of
the
present
company
will
respond
kindly
to
you
and
you
can
choose
whom
you
like
of
them
i
should
recommend
you
to
take
a
young
person
theaetetus
for
example
unless
you
have
a
preference
for
some
one
else
stranger
i
feel
ashamed
socrates
being
a
into
your
society
instead
of
talking
a
little
and
hearing
others
talk
to
be
spinning
out
a
long
soliloquy
or
address
as
if
i
wanted
to
show
off
for
the
true
answer
will
certainly
be
a
very
long
one
a
great
deal
longer
than
might
be
expected
from
such
a
short
and
simple
question
at
the
same
time
i
fear
that
i
may
seem
rude
and
ungracious
if
i
refuse
your
courteous
request
especially
after
what
you
have
said
for
i
certainly
can
not
object
to
your
proposal
that
theaetetus
should
respond
having
already
conversed
with
him
myself
and
being
recommended
by
you
to
take
him
theaetetus
but
are
you
sure
stranger
that
this
will
be
quite
so
acceptable
to
the
rest
of
the
company
as
socrates
imagines
stranger
you
hear
them
applauding
theaetetus
after
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
well
then
i
am
to
argue
with
you
and
if
you
tire
of
the
argument
you
may
complain
of
your
friends
and
not
of
me
theaetetus
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
tire
and
if
i
do
i
shall
get
my
friend
here
young
socrates
the
namesake
of
the
elder
socrates
to
help
he
is
about
my
own
age
and
my
partner
at
the
gymnasium
and
is
constantly
accustomed
to
work
with
me
stranger
very
good
you
can
decide
about
that
for
yourself
as
we
proceed
meanwhile
you
and
i
will
begin
together
and
enquire
into
the
nature
of
the
sophist
first
of
the
three
i
should
like
you
to
make
out
what
he
is
and
bring
him
to
light
in
a
discussion
for
at
present
we
are
only
agreed
about
the
name
but
of
the
thing
to
which
we
both
apply
the
name
possibly
you
have
one
notion
and
i
another
whereas
we
ought
always
to
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
thing
itself
in
terms
of
a
definition
and
not
merely
about
the
name
minus
the
definition
now
the
tribe
of
sophists
which
we
are
investigating
is
not
easily
caught
or
defined
and
the
world
has
long
ago
agreed
that
if
great
subjects
are
to
be
adequately
treated
they
must
be
studied
in
the
lesser
and
easier
instances
of
them
before
we
proceed
to
the
greatest
of
all
and
as
i
know
that
the
tribe
of
sophists
is
troublesome
and
hard
to
be
caught
i
should
recommend
that
we
practise
beforehand
the
method
which
is
to
be
applied
to
him
on
some
simple
and
smaller
thing
unless
you
can
suggest
a
better
way
theaetetus
indeed
i
can
not
stranger
then
suppose
that
we
work
out
some
lesser
example
which
will
be
a
pattern
of
the
greater
theaetetus
good
stranger
what
is
there
which
is
well
known
and
not
great
and
is
yet
as
susceptible
of
definition
as
any
larger
thing
shall
i
say
an
angler
he
is
familiar
to
all
of
us
and
not
a
very
interesting
or
important
person
theaetetus
he
is
not
stranger
yet
i
suspect
that
he
will
furnish
us
with
the
sort
of
definition
and
line
of
enquiry
which
we
want
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
let
us
begin
by
asking
whether
he
is
a
man
having
art
or
not
having
art
but
some
other
power
theaetetus
he
is
clearly
a
man
of
art
stranger
and
of
arts
there
are
two
kinds
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
there
is
agriculture
and
the
tending
of
mortal
creatures
and
the
art
of
constructing
or
moulding
vessels
and
there
is
the
art
of
imitation
all
these
may
be
appropriately
called
by
a
single
name
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
and
what
is
the
name
stranger
he
who
brings
into
existence
something
that
did
not
exist
before
is
said
to
be
a
producer
and
that
which
is
brought
into
existence
is
said
to
be
produced
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
all
the
arts
which
were
just
now
mentioned
are
characterized
by
this
power
of
producing
theaetetus
they
are
stranger
then
let
us
sum
them
up
under
the
name
of
productive
or
creative
art
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
next
follows
the
whole
class
of
learning
and
cognition
then
comes
trade
fighting
hunting
and
since
none
of
these
produces
anything
but
is
only
engaged
in
conquering
by
word
or
deed
or
in
preventing
others
from
conquering
things
which
exist
and
have
been
already
produced
in
each
and
all
of
these
branches
there
appears
to
be
an
art
which
may
be
called
acquisitive
theaetetus
yes
that
is
the
proper
name
stranger
seeing
then
that
all
arts
are
either
acquisitive
or
creative
in
which
class
shall
we
place
the
art
of
the
angler
theaetetus
clearly
in
the
acquisitive
class
stranger
and
the
acquisitive
may
be
subdivided
into
two
parts
there
is
exchange
which
is
voluntary
and
is
effected
by
gifts
hire
purchase
and
the
other
part
of
acquisitive
which
takes
by
force
of
word
or
deed
may
be
termed
conquest
theaetetus
that
is
implied
in
what
has
been
said
stranger
and
may
not
conquest
be
again
subdivided
theaetetus
how
stranger
open
force
may
be
called
fighting
and
secret
force
may
have
the
general
name
of
hunting
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
art
of
hunting
should
not
be
further
divided
theaetetus
how
would
you
make
the
division
stranger
into
the
hunting
of
living
and
of
lifeless
prey
theaetetus
yes
if
both
kinds
exist
stranger
of
course
they
exist
but
the
hunting
after
lifeless
things
having
no
special
name
except
some
sorts
of
diving
and
other
small
matters
may
be
omitted
the
hunting
after
living
things
may
be
called
animal
hunting
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
animal
hunting
may
be
truly
said
to
have
two
divisions
hunting
which
has
many
kinds
and
names
and
hunting
or
the
hunting
after
animals
who
swim
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
of
swimming
animals
one
class
lives
on
the
wing
and
the
other
in
the
water
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
fowling
is
the
general
term
under
which
the
hunting
of
all
birds
is
included
theaetetus
true
stranger
the
hunting
of
animals
who
live
in
the
water
has
the
general
name
of
fishing
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
this
sort
of
hunting
may
be
further
divided
also
into
two
principal
kinds
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
there
is
one
kind
which
takes
them
in
nets
another
which
takes
them
by
a
blow
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
and
how
do
you
distinguish
them
stranger
as
to
the
first
kind
all
that
surrounds
and
encloses
anything
to
prevent
egress
may
be
rightly
called
an
enclosure
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
for
which
reason
twig
baskets
nooses
creels
and
the
like
may
all
be
termed
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
therefore
this
first
kind
of
capture
may
be
called
by
us
capture
with
enclosures
or
something
of
that
sort
theaetetus
yes
stranger
the
other
kind
which
is
practised
by
a
blow
with
hooks
and
spears
when
summed
up
under
one
name
may
be
called
striking
unless
you
theaetetus
can
find
some
better
name
theaetetus
never
mind
the
name
what
you
suggest
will
do
very
well
stranger
there
is
one
mode
of
striking
which
is
done
at
night
and
by
the
light
of
a
fire
and
is
by
the
hunters
themselves
called
firing
or
spearing
by
firelight
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
the
fishing
by
day
is
called
by
the
general
name
of
barbing
because
the
spears
too
are
barbed
at
the
point
theaetetus
yes
that
is
the
term
stranger
of
this
that
which
strikes
the
fish
who
is
below
from
above
is
called
spearing
because
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
spears
are
mostly
used
theaetetus
yes
it
is
often
called
so
stranger
then
now
there
is
only
one
kind
remaining
theaetetus
what
is
that
stranger
when
a
hook
is
used
and
the
fish
is
not
struck
in
any
chance
part
of
his
body
as
he
is
with
the
spear
but
only
about
the
head
and
mouth
and
is
then
drawn
out
from
below
upwards
with
reeds
and
rods
what
is
the
right
name
of
that
mode
of
fishing
theaetetus
theaetetus
i
suspect
that
we
have
now
discovered
the
object
of
our
search
stranger
then
now
you
and
i
have
come
to
an
understanding
not
only
about
the
name
of
the
angler
art
but
about
the
definition
of
the
thing
itself
one
half
of
all
art
was
acquisitive
half
of
the
acquisitive
art
was
conquest
or
taking
by
force
half
of
this
was
hunting
and
half
of
hunting
was
hunting
animals
half
of
this
was
hunting
water
animals
of
this
again
the
under
half
was
fishing
half
of
fishing
was
striking
a
part
of
striking
was
fishing
with
a
barb
and
one
half
of
this
again
being
the
kind
which
strikes
with
a
hook
and
draws
the
fish
from
below
upwards
is
the
art
which
we
have
been
seeking
and
which
from
the
nature
of
the
operation
is
denoted
angling
or
drawing
up
aspalieutike
anaspasthai
theaetetus
the
result
has
been
quite
satisfactorily
brought
out
stranger
and
now
following
this
pattern
let
us
endeavour
to
find
out
what
a
sophist
is
theaetetus
by
all
means
stranger
the
first
question
about
the
angler
was
whether
he
was
a
skilled
artist
or
unskilled
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
shall
we
call
our
new
friend
unskilled
or
a
thorough
master
of
his
craft
theaetetus
certainly
not
unskilled
for
his
name
as
indeed
you
imply
must
surely
express
his
nature
stranger
then
he
must
be
supposed
to
have
some
art
theaetetus
what
art
stranger
by
heaven
they
are
cousins
it
never
occurred
to
us
theaetetus
who
are
cousins
stranger
the
angler
and
the
sophist
theaetetus
in
what
way
are
they
related
stranger
they
both
appear
to
me
to
be
hunters
theaetetus
how
the
sophist
of
the
other
we
have
spoken
stranger
you
remember
our
division
of
hunting
into
hunting
after
swimming
animals
and
land
animals
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
you
remember
that
we
subdivided
the
swimming
and
left
the
land
animals
saying
that
there
were
many
kinds
of
them
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
thus
far
then
the
sophist
and
the
angler
starting
from
the
art
of
acquiring
take
the
same
road
theaetetus
so
it
would
appear
stranger
their
paths
diverge
when
they
reach
the
art
of
animal
hunting
the
one
going
to
the
and
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
lakes
and
angling
for
the
animals
which
are
in
them
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
while
the
other
goes
to
land
and
water
of
another
sort
rivers
of
wealth
and
broad
of
generous
youth
and
he
also
is
intending
to
take
the
animals
which
are
in
them
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
of
hunting
on
land
there
are
two
principal
divisions
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
one
is
the
hunting
of
tame
and
the
other
of
wild
animals
theaetetus
but
are
tame
animals
ever
hunted
stranger
yes
if
you
include
man
under
tame
animals
but
if
you
like
you
may
say
that
there
are
no
tame
animals
or
that
if
there
are
man
is
not
among
them
or
you
may
say
that
man
is
a
tame
animal
but
is
not
hunted
you
shall
decide
which
of
these
alternatives
you
prefer
theaetetus
i
should
say
stranger
that
man
is
a
tame
animal
and
i
admit
that
he
is
hunted
stranger
then
let
us
divide
the
hunting
of
tame
animals
into
two
parts
theaetetus
how
shall
we
make
the
division
stranger
let
us
define
piracy
tyranny
the
whole
military
art
by
one
name
as
hunting
with
violence
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
but
the
art
of
the
lawyer
of
the
popular
orator
and
the
art
of
conversation
may
be
called
in
one
word
the
art
of
persuasion
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
of
persuasion
there
may
be
said
to
be
two
kinds
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
one
is
private
and
the
other
public
theaetetus
yes
each
of
them
forms
a
class
stranger
and
of
private
hunting
one
sort
receives
hire
and
the
other
brings
gifts
theaetetus
i
do
not
understand
you
stranger
you
seem
never
to
have
observed
the
manner
in
which
lovers
hunt
theaetetus
to
what
do
you
refer
stranger
i
mean
that
they
lavish
gifts
on
those
whom
they
hunt
in
addition
to
other
inducements
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
let
us
admit
this
then
to
be
the
amatory
art
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
that
sort
of
hireling
whose
conversation
is
pleasing
and
who
baits
his
hook
only
with
pleasure
and
exacts
nothing
but
his
maintenance
in
return
we
should
all
if
i
am
not
mistaken
describe
as
possessing
flattery
or
an
art
of
making
things
pleasant
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
that
sort
which
professes
to
form
acquaintances
only
for
the
sake
of
virtue
and
demands
a
reward
in
the
shape
of
money
may
be
fairly
called
by
another
name
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
and
what
is
the
name
will
you
tell
me
theaetetus
it
is
obvious
enough
for
i
believe
that
we
have
discovered
the
sophist
which
is
as
i
conceive
the
proper
name
for
the
class
described
stranger
then
now
theaetetus
his
art
may
be
traced
as
a
branch
of
the
appropriative
acquisitive
family
which
hunts
animals
living
land
tame
animals
which
hunts
man
privately
for
hire
taking
money
in
exchange
having
the
semblance
of
education
and
this
is
termed
sophistry
and
is
a
hunt
after
young
men
of
wealth
and
rank
such
is
the
conclusion
theaetetus
just
so
stranger
let
us
take
another
branch
of
his
genealogy
for
he
is
a
professor
of
a
great
and
art
and
if
we
look
back
at
what
has
preceded
we
see
that
he
presents
another
aspect
besides
that
of
which
we
are
speaking
theaetetus
in
what
respect
stranger
there
were
two
sorts
of
acquisitive
art
the
one
concerned
with
hunting
the
other
with
exchange
theaetetus
there
were
stranger
and
of
the
art
of
exchange
there
are
two
divisions
the
one
of
giving
and
the
other
of
selling
theaetetus
let
us
assume
that
stranger
next
we
will
suppose
the
art
of
selling
to
be
divided
into
two
parts
theaetetus
how
stranger
there
is
one
part
which
is
distinguished
as
the
sale
of
a
man
own
productions
another
which
is
the
exchange
of
the
works
of
others
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
is
not
that
part
of
exchange
which
takes
place
in
the
city
being
about
half
of
the
whole
termed
retailing
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
that
which
exchanges
the
goods
of
one
city
for
those
of
another
by
selling
and
buying
is
the
exchange
of
the
merchant
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
and
you
are
aware
that
this
exchange
of
the
merchant
is
of
two
kinds
it
is
partly
concerned
with
food
for
the
use
of
the
body
and
partly
with
the
food
of
the
soul
which
is
bartered
and
received
in
exchange
for
money
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
you
want
to
know
what
is
the
meaning
of
food
for
the
soul
the
other
kind
you
surely
understand
theaetetus
yes
stranger
take
music
in
general
and
painting
and
marionette
playing
and
many
other
things
which
are
purchased
in
one
city
and
carried
away
and
sold
in
another
wares
of
the
soul
which
are
hawked
about
either
for
the
sake
of
instruction
or
amusement
may
not
he
who
takes
them
about
and
sells
them
be
quite
as
truly
called
a
merchant
as
he
who
sells
meats
and
drinks
theaetetus
to
be
sure
he
may
stranger
and
would
you
not
call
by
the
same
name
him
who
buys
up
knowledge
and
goes
about
from
city
to
city
exchanging
his
wares
for
money
theaetetus
certainly
i
should
stranger
of
this
merchandise
of
the
soul
may
not
one
part
be
fairly
termed
the
art
of
display
and
there
is
another
part
which
is
certainly
not
less
ridiculous
but
being
a
trade
in
learning
must
be
called
by
some
name
germane
to
the
matter
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
the
latter
should
have
two
names
one
descriptive
of
the
sale
of
the
knowledge
of
virtue
and
the
other
of
the
sale
of
other
kinds
of
knowledge
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
the
name
of
corresponds
well
enough
to
the
latter
but
you
must
try
and
tell
me
the
name
of
the
other
theaetetus
he
must
be
the
sophist
whom
we
are
seeking
no
other
name
can
possibly
be
right
stranger
no
other
and
so
this
trader
in
virtue
again
turns
out
to
be
our
friend
the
sophist
whose
art
may
now
be
traced
from
the
art
of
acquisition
through
exchange
trade
merchandise
to
a
merchandise
of
the
soul
which
is
concerned
with
speech
and
the
knowledge
of
virtue
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
there
may
be
a
third
reappearance
of
him
for
he
may
have
settled
down
in
a
city
and
may
fabricate
as
well
as
buy
these
same
wares
intending
to
live
by
selling
them
and
he
would
still
be
called
a
sophist
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
then
that
part
of
the
acquisitive
art
which
exchanges
and
of
exchange
which
either
sells
a
man
own
productions
or
retails
those
of
others
as
the
case
may
be
and
in
either
way
sells
the
knowledge
of
virtue
you
would
again
term
sophistry
theaetetus
i
must
if
i
am
to
keep
pace
with
the
argument
stranger
let
us
consider
once
more
whether
there
may
not
be
yet
another
aspect
of
sophistry
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
in
the
acquisitive
there
was
a
subdivision
of
the
combative
or
fighting
art
theaetetus
there
was
stranger
perhaps
we
had
better
divide
it
theaetetus
what
shall
be
the
divisions
stranger
there
shall
be
one
division
of
the
competitive
and
another
of
the
pugnacious
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
that
part
of
the
pugnacious
which
is
a
contest
of
bodily
strength
may
be
properly
called
by
some
such
name
as
violent
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
when
the
war
is
one
of
words
it
may
be
termed
controversy
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
controversy
may
be
of
two
kinds
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
when
long
speeches
are
answered
by
long
speeches
and
there
is
public
discussion
about
the
just
and
unjust
that
is
forensic
controversy
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
there
is
a
private
sort
of
controversy
which
is
cut
up
into
questions
and
answers
and
this
is
commonly
called
disputation
theaetetus
yes
that
is
the
name
stranger
and
of
disputation
that
sort
which
is
only
a
discussion
about
contracts
and
is
carried
on
at
random
and
without
rules
of
art
is
recognized
by
the
reasoning
faculty
to
be
a
distinct
class
but
has
hitherto
had
no
distinctive
name
and
does
not
deserve
to
receive
one
from
us
theaetetus
no
for
the
different
sorts
of
it
are
too
minute
and
heterogeneous
stranger
but
that
which
proceeds
by
rules
of
art
to
dispute
about
justice
and
injustice
in
their
own
nature
and
about
things
in
general
we
have
been
accustomed
to
call
argumentation
eristic
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
of
argumentation
one
sort
wastes
money
and
the
other
makes
money
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
suppose
we
try
and
give
to
each
of
these
two
classes
a
name
theaetetus
let
us
do
so
stranger
i
should
say
that
the
habit
which
leads
a
man
to
neglect
his
own
affairs
for
the
pleasure
of
conversation
of
which
the
style
is
far
from
being
agreeable
to
the
majority
of
his
hearers
may
be
fairly
termed
loquacity
such
is
my
opinion
theaetetus
that
is
the
common
name
for
it
stranger
but
now
who
the
other
is
who
makes
money
out
of
private
disputation
it
is
your
turn
to
say
theaetetus
there
is
only
one
true
answer
he
is
the
wonderful
sophist
of
whom
we
are
in
pursuit
and
who
reappears
again
for
the
fourth
time
stranger
yes
and
with
a
fresh
pedigree
for
he
is
the
species
of
the
eristic
disputatious
controversial
pugnacious
combative
acquisitive
family
as
the
argument
has
already
proven
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
how
true
was
the
observation
that
he
was
a
animal
and
not
to
be
caught
with
one
hand
as
they
say
theaetetus
then
you
must
catch
him
with
two
stranger
yes
we
must
if
we
can
and
therefore
let
us
try
another
track
in
our
pursuit
of
him
you
are
aware
that
there
are
certain
menial
occupations
which
have
names
among
servants
theaetetus
yes
there
are
many
such
which
of
them
do
you
mean
stranger
i
mean
such
as
sifting
straining
winnowing
threshing
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
besides
these
there
are
a
great
many
more
such
as
carding
spinning
adjusting
the
warp
and
the
woof
and
thousands
of
similar
expressions
are
used
in
the
arts
theaetetus
of
what
are
they
to
be
patterns
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
all
stranger
i
think
that
in
all
of
these
there
is
implied
a
notion
of
division
theaetetus
yes
stranger
then
if
as
i
was
saying
there
is
one
art
which
includes
all
of
them
ought
not
that
art
to
have
one
name
theaetetus
and
what
is
the
name
of
the
art
stranger
the
art
of
discerning
or
discriminating
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
think
whether
you
can
not
divide
this
theaetetus
i
should
have
to
think
a
long
while
stranger
in
all
the
previously
named
processes
either
like
has
been
separated
from
like
or
the
better
from
the
worse
theaetetus
i
see
now
what
you
mean
stranger
there
is
no
name
for
the
first
kind
of
separation
of
the
second
which
throws
away
the
worse
and
preserves
the
better
i
do
know
a
name
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
every
discernment
or
discrimination
of
that
kind
as
i
have
observed
is
called
a
purification
theaetetus
yes
that
is
the
usual
expression
stranger
and
any
one
may
see
that
purification
is
of
two
kinds
theaetetus
perhaps
so
if
he
were
allowed
time
to
think
but
i
do
not
see
at
this
moment
stranger
there
are
many
purifications
of
bodies
which
may
with
propriety
be
comprehended
under
a
single
name
theaetetus
what
are
they
and
what
is
their
name
stranger
there
is
the
purification
of
living
bodies
in
their
inward
and
in
their
outward
parts
of
which
the
former
is
duly
effected
by
medicine
and
gymnastic
the
latter
by
the
not
very
dignified
art
of
the
and
there
is
the
purification
of
inanimate
substances
to
this
the
arts
of
fulling
and
of
furbishing
in
general
attend
in
a
number
of
minute
particulars
having
a
variety
of
names
which
are
thought
ridiculous
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
thought
ridiculous
theaetetus
but
then
the
dialectical
art
never
considers
whether
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
purge
is
greater
or
less
than
that
to
be
derived
from
the
sponge
and
has
not
more
interest
in
the
one
than
in
the
other
her
endeavour
is
to
know
what
is
and
is
not
kindred
in
all
arts
with
a
view
to
the
acquisition
of
intelligence
and
having
this
in
view
she
honours
them
all
alike
and
when
she
makes
comparisons
she
counts
one
of
them
not
a
whit
more
ridiculous
than
another
nor
does
she
esteem
him
who
adduces
as
his
example
of
hunting
the
general
art
at
all
more
decorous
than
another
who
cites
that
of
the
but
only
as
the
greater
pretender
of
the
two
and
as
to
your
question
concerning
the
name
which
was
to
comprehend
all
these
arts
of
purification
whether
of
animate
or
inanimate
bodies
the
art
of
dialectic
is
in
no
wise
particular
about
fine
words
if
she
may
be
only
allowed
to
have
a
general
name
for
all
other
purifications
binding
them
up
together
and
separating
them
off
from
the
purification
of
the
soul
or
intellect
for
this
is
the
purification
at
which
she
wants
to
arrive
and
this
we
should
understand
to
be
her
aim
theaetetus
yes
i
understand
and
i
agree
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
purification
and
that
one
of
them
is
concerned
with
the
soul
and
that
there
is
another
which
is
concerned
with
the
body
stranger
excellent
and
now
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
try
to
divide
further
the
first
of
the
two
theaetetus
whatever
line
of
division
you
suggest
i
will
endeavour
to
assist
you
stranger
do
we
admit
that
virtue
is
distinct
from
vice
in
the
soul
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
purification
was
to
leave
the
good
and
to
cast
out
whatever
is
bad
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
any
taking
away
of
evil
from
the
soul
may
be
properly
called
purification
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
in
the
soul
there
are
two
kinds
of
evil
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
the
one
may
be
compared
to
disease
in
the
body
the
other
to
deformity
theaetetus
i
do
not
understand
stranger
perhaps
you
have
never
reflected
that
disease
and
discord
are
the
same
theaetetus
to
this
again
i
know
not
what
i
should
reply
stranger
do
you
not
conceive
discord
to
be
a
dissolution
of
kindred
elements
originating
in
some
disagreement
theaetetus
just
that
stranger
and
is
deformity
anything
but
the
want
of
measure
which
is
always
unsightly
theaetetus
exactly
stranger
and
do
we
not
see
that
opinion
is
opposed
to
desire
pleasure
to
anger
reason
to
pain
and
that
all
these
elements
are
opposed
to
one
another
in
the
souls
of
bad
men
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
yet
they
must
all
be
akin
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
then
we
shall
be
right
in
calling
vice
a
discord
and
disease
of
the
soul
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
and
when
things
having
motion
and
aiming
at
an
appointed
mark
continually
miss
their
aim
and
glance
aside
shall
we
say
that
this
is
the
effect
of
symmetry
among
them
or
of
the
want
of
symmetry
theaetetus
clearly
of
the
want
of
symmetry
stranger
but
surely
we
know
that
no
soul
is
voluntarily
ignorant
of
anything
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
and
what
is
ignorance
but
the
aberration
of
a
mind
which
is
bent
on
truth
and
in
which
the
process
of
understanding
is
perverted
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
we
are
to
regard
an
unintelligent
soul
as
deformed
and
devoid
of
symmetry
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
then
there
are
these
two
kinds
of
evil
in
the
soul
the
one
which
is
generally
called
vice
and
is
obviously
a
disease
of
the
soul
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
there
is
the
other
which
they
call
ignorance
and
which
because
existing
only
in
the
soul
they
will
not
allow
to
be
vice
theaetetus
i
certainly
admit
what
i
at
first
disputed
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
vice
in
the
soul
and
that
we
ought
to
consider
cowardice
intemperance
and
injustice
to
be
alike
forms
of
disease
in
the
soul
and
ignorance
of
which
there
are
all
sorts
of
varieties
to
be
deformity
stranger
and
in
the
case
of
the
body
are
there
not
two
arts
which
have
to
do
with
the
two
bodily
states
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
there
is
gymnastic
which
has
to
do
with
deformity
and
medicine
which
has
to
do
with
disease
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
where
there
is
insolence
and
injustice
and
cowardice
is
not
chastisement
the
art
which
is
most
required
theaetetus
that
certainly
appears
to
be
the
opinion
of
mankind
stranger
again
of
the
various
kinds
of
ignorance
may
not
instruction
be
rightly
said
to
be
the
remedy
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
of
the
art
of
instruction
shall
we
say
that
there
is
one
or
many
kinds
at
any
rate
there
are
two
principal
ones
think
theaetetus
i
will
stranger
i
believe
that
i
can
see
how
we
shall
soonest
arrive
at
the
answer
to
this
question
theaetetus
how
stranger
if
we
can
discover
a
line
which
divides
ignorance
into
two
halves
for
a
division
of
ignorance
into
two
parts
will
certainly
imply
that
the
art
of
instruction
is
also
twofold
answering
to
the
two
divisions
of
ignorance
theaetetus
well
and
do
you
see
what
you
are
looking
for
stranger
i
do
seem
to
myself
to
see
one
very
large
and
bad
sort
of
ignorance
which
is
quite
separate
and
may
be
weighed
in
the
scale
against
all
other
sorts
of
ignorance
put
together
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
when
a
person
supposes
that
he
knows
and
does
not
know
this
appears
to
be
the
great
source
of
all
the
errors
of
the
intellect
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
this
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
the
kind
of
ignorance
which
specially
earns
the
title
of
stupidity
theaetetus
true
stranger
what
name
then
shall
be
given
to
the
sort
of
instruction
which
gets
rid
of
this
theaetetus
the
instruction
which
you
mean
stranger
is
i
should
imagine
not
the
teaching
of
handicraft
arts
but
what
thanks
to
us
has
been
termed
education
in
this
part
the
world
stranger
yes
theaetetus
and
by
nearly
all
hellenes
but
we
have
still
to
consider
whether
education
admits
of
any
further
division
theaetetus
we
have
stranger
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
such
a
division
is
possible
theaetetus
where
stranger
of
education
one
method
appears
to
be
rougher
and
another
smoother
theaetetus
how
are
we
to
distinguish
the
two
stranger
there
is
the
mode
which
our
fathers
commonly
practised
towards
their
sons
and
which
is
still
adopted
by
many
either
of
roughly
reproving
their
errors
or
of
gently
advising
them
which
varieties
may
be
correctly
included
under
the
general
term
of
admonition
theaetetus
true
stranger
but
whereas
some
appear
to
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
all
ignorance
is
involuntary
and
that
no
one
who
thinks
himself
wise
is
willing
to
learn
any
of
those
things
in
which
he
is
conscious
of
his
own
cleverness
and
that
the
admonitory
sort
of
instruction
gives
much
trouble
and
does
little
good
theaetetus
there
they
are
quite
right
stranger
accordingly
they
set
to
work
to
eradicate
the
spirit
of
conceit
in
another
way
theaetetus
in
what
way
stranger
they
a
man
words
when
he
thinks
that
he
is
saying
something
and
is
really
saying
nothing
and
easily
convict
him
of
inconsistencies
in
his
opinions
these
they
then
collect
by
the
dialectical
process
and
placing
them
side
by
side
show
that
they
contradict
one
another
about
the
same
things
in
relation
to
the
same
things
and
in
the
same
respect
he
seeing
this
is
angry
with
himself
and
grows
gentle
towards
others
and
thus
is
entirely
delivered
from
great
prejudices
and
harsh
notions
in
a
way
which
is
most
amusing
to
the
hearer
and
produces
the
most
lasting
good
effect
on
the
person
who
is
the
subject
of
the
operation
for
as
the
physician
considers
that
the
body
will
receive
no
benefit
from
taking
food
until
the
internal
obstacles
have
been
removed
so
the
purifier
of
the
soul
is
conscious
that
his
patient
will
receive
no
benefit
from
the
application
of
knowledge
until
he
is
refuted
and
from
refutation
learns
modesty
he
must
be
purged
of
his
prejudices
first
and
made
to
think
that
he
knows
only
what
he
knows
and
no
more
theaetetus
that
is
certainly
the
best
and
wisest
state
of
mind
stranger
for
all
these
reasons
theaetetus
we
must
admit
that
refutation
is
the
greatest
and
chiefest
of
purifications
and
he
who
has
not
been
refuted
though
he
be
the
great
king
himself
is
in
an
awful
state
of
impurity
he
is
uninstructed
and
deformed
in
those
things
in
which
he
who
would
be
truly
blessed
ought
to
be
fairest
and
purest
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
and
who
are
the
ministers
of
this
art
i
am
afraid
to
say
the
sophists
theaetetus
why
stranger
lest
we
should
assign
to
them
too
high
a
prerogative
theaetetus
yet
the
sophist
has
a
certain
likeness
to
our
minister
of
purification
stranger
yes
the
same
sort
of
likeness
which
a
wolf
who
is
the
fiercest
of
animals
has
to
a
dog
who
is
the
gentlest
but
he
who
would
not
be
found
tripping
ought
to
be
very
careful
in
this
matter
of
comparisons
for
they
are
most
slippery
things
nevertheless
let
us
assume
that
the
sophists
are
the
men
i
say
this
provisionally
for
i
think
that
the
line
which
divides
them
will
be
marked
enough
if
proper
care
is
taken
theaetetus
likely
enough
stranger
let
us
grant
then
that
from
the
discerning
art
comes
purification
and
from
purification
let
there
be
separated
off
a
part
which
is
concerned
with
the
soul
of
this
mental
purification
instruction
is
a
portion
and
of
instruction
education
and
of
education
that
refutation
of
vain
conceit
which
has
been
discovered
in
the
present
argument
and
let
this
be
called
by
you
and
me
the
art
of
sophistry
theaetetus
very
well
and
yet
considering
the
number
of
forms
in
which
he
has
presented
himself
i
begin
to
doubt
how
i
can
with
any
truth
or
confidence
describe
the
real
nature
of
the
sophist
stranger
you
naturally
feel
perplexed
and
yet
i
think
that
he
must
be
still
more
perplexed
in
his
attempt
to
escape
us
for
as
the
proverb
says
when
every
way
is
blocked
there
is
no
escape
now
then
is
the
time
of
all
others
to
set
upon
him
theaetetus
true
stranger
first
let
us
wait
a
moment
and
recover
breath
and
while
we
are
resting
we
may
reckon
up
in
how
many
forms
he
has
appeared
in
the
first
place
he
was
discovered
to
be
a
paid
hunter
after
wealth
and
youth
theaetetus
yes
stranger
in
the
second
place
he
was
a
merchant
in
the
goods
of
the
soul
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
in
the
third
place
he
has
turned
out
to
be
a
retailer
of
the
same
sort
of
wares
theaetetus
yes
and
in
the
fourth
place
he
himself
manufactured
the
learned
wares
which
he
sold
stranger
quite
right
i
will
try
and
remember
the
fifth
myself
he
belonged
to
the
fighting
class
and
was
further
distinguished
as
a
hero
of
debate
who
professed
the
eristic
art
theaetetus
true
stranger
the
sixth
point
was
doubtful
and
yet
we
at
last
agreed
that
he
was
a
purger
of
souls
who
cleared
away
notions
obstructive
to
knowledge
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
do
you
not
see
that
when
the
professor
of
any
art
has
one
name
and
many
kinds
of
knowledge
there
must
be
something
wrong
the
multiplicity
of
names
which
is
applied
to
him
shows
that
the
common
principle
to
which
all
these
branches
of
knowledge
are
tending
is
not
understood
theaetetus
i
should
imagine
this
to
be
the
case
stranger
at
any
rate
we
will
understand
him
and
no
indolence
shall
prevent
us
let
us
begin
again
then
and
some
of
our
statements
concerning
the
sophist
there
was
one
thing
which
appeared
to
me
especially
characteristic
of
him
theaetetus
to
what
are
you
referring
stranger
we
were
saying
of
him
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
he
was
a
disputer
theaetetus
we
were
stranger
and
does
he
not
also
teach
others
the
art
of
disputation
theaetetus
certainly
he
does
stranger
and
about
what
does
he
profess
that
he
teaches
men
to
dispute
to
begin
at
the
beginning
does
he
make
them
able
to
dispute
about
divine
things
which
are
invisible
to
men
in
general
theaetetus
at
any
rate
he
is
said
to
do
so
stranger
and
what
do
you
say
of
the
visible
things
in
heaven
and
earth
and
the
like
theaetetus
certainly
he
disputes
and
teaches
to
dispute
about
them
stranger
then
again
in
private
conversation
when
any
universal
assertion
is
made
about
generation
and
essence
we
know
that
such
persons
are
tremendous
argufiers
and
are
able
to
impart
their
own
skill
to
others
theaetetus
undoubtedly
stranger
and
do
they
not
profess
to
make
men
able
to
dispute
about
law
and
about
politics
in
general
theaetetus
why
no
one
would
have
anything
to
say
to
them
if
they
did
not
make
these
professions
stranger
in
all
and
every
art
what
the
craftsman
ought
to
say
in
answer
to
any
question
is
written
down
in
a
popular
form
and
he
who
likes
may
learn
theaetetus
i
suppose
that
you
are
referring
to
the
precepts
of
protagoras
about
wrestling
and
the
other
arts
stranger
yes
my
friend
and
about
a
good
many
other
things
in
a
word
is
not
the
art
of
disputation
a
power
of
disputing
about
all
things
theaetetus
certainly
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
which
is
left
out
stranger
but
oh
my
dear
youth
do
you
suppose
this
possible
for
perhaps
your
young
eyes
may
see
things
which
to
our
duller
sight
do
not
appear
theaetetus
to
what
are
you
alluding
i
do
not
think
that
i
understand
your
present
question
stranger
i
ask
whether
anybody
can
understand
all
things
theaetetus
happy
would
mankind
be
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
socrates
but
how
can
any
one
who
is
ignorant
dispute
in
a
rational
manner
against
him
who
knows
theaetetus
he
can
not
stranger
then
why
has
the
sophistical
art
such
a
mysterious
power
theaetetus
to
what
do
you
refer
stranger
how
do
the
sophists
make
young
men
believe
in
their
supreme
and
universal
wisdom
for
if
they
neither
disputed
nor
were
thought
to
dispute
rightly
or
being
thought
to
do
so
were
deemed
no
wiser
for
their
controversial
skill
then
to
quote
your
own
observation
no
one
would
give
them
money
or
be
willing
to
learn
their
art
theaetetus
they
certainly
would
not
stranger
but
they
are
willing
theaetetus
yes
they
are
stranger
yes
and
the
reason
as
i
should
imagine
is
that
they
are
supposed
to
have
knowledge
of
those
things
about
which
they
dispute
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
they
dispute
about
all
things
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
therefore
to
their
disciples
they
appear
to
be
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
they
are
not
for
that
was
shown
to
be
impossible
theaetetus
impossible
of
course
stranger
then
the
sophist
has
been
shown
to
have
a
sort
of
conjectural
or
apparent
knowledge
only
of
all
things
which
is
not
the
truth
theaetetus
exactly
no
better
description
of
him
could
be
given
stranger
let
us
now
take
an
illustration
which
will
still
more
clearly
explain
his
nature
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
i
will
tell
you
and
you
shall
answer
me
giving
your
very
closest
attention
suppose
that
a
person
were
to
profess
not
that
he
could
speak
or
dispute
but
that
he
knew
how
to
make
and
do
all
things
by
a
single
art
theaetetus
all
things
stranger
i
see
that
you
do
not
understand
the
first
word
that
i
utter
for
you
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
theaetetus
no
i
do
not
stranger
under
all
things
i
include
you
and
me
and
also
animals
and
trees
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
suppose
a
person
to
say
that
he
will
make
you
and
me
and
all
creatures
theaetetus
what
would
he
mean
by
he
can
not
be
a
husbandman
for
you
said
that
he
is
a
maker
of
animals
stranger
yes
and
i
say
that
he
is
also
the
maker
of
the
sea
and
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
the
gods
and
of
all
other
things
and
further
that
he
can
make
them
in
no
time
and
sell
them
for
a
few
pence
theaetetus
that
must
be
a
jest
stranger
and
when
a
man
says
that
he
knows
all
things
and
can
teach
them
to
another
at
a
small
cost
and
in
a
short
time
is
not
that
a
jest
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
is
there
any
more
artistic
or
graceful
form
of
jest
than
imitation
theaetetus
certainly
not
and
imitation
is
a
very
comprehensive
term
which
includes
under
one
class
the
most
diverse
sorts
of
things
stranger
we
know
of
course
that
he
who
professes
by
one
art
to
make
all
things
is
really
a
painter
and
by
the
painter
art
makes
resemblances
of
real
things
which
have
the
same
name
with
them
and
he
can
deceive
the
less
intelligent
sort
of
young
children
to
whom
he
shows
his
pictures
at
a
distance
into
the
belief
that
he
has
the
absolute
power
of
making
whatever
he
likes
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
may
there
not
be
supposed
to
be
an
imitative
art
of
reasoning
is
it
not
possible
to
enchant
the
hearts
of
young
men
by
words
poured
through
their
ears
when
they
are
still
at
a
distance
from
the
truth
of
facts
by
exhibiting
to
them
fictitious
arguments
and
making
them
think
that
they
are
true
and
that
the
speaker
is
the
wisest
of
men
in
all
things
theaetetus
yes
why
should
there
not
be
another
such
art
stranger
but
as
time
goes
on
and
their
hearers
advance
in
years
and
come
into
closer
contact
with
realities
and
have
learnt
by
sad
experience
to
see
and
feel
the
truth
of
things
are
not
the
greater
part
of
them
compelled
to
change
many
opinions
which
they
formerly
entertained
so
that
the
great
appears
small
to
them
and
the
easy
difficult
and
all
their
dreamy
speculations
are
overturned
by
the
facts
of
life
theaetetus
that
is
my
view
as
far
as
i
can
judge
although
at
my
age
i
may
be
one
of
those
who
see
things
at
a
distance
only
stranger
and
the
wish
of
all
of
us
who
are
your
friends
is
and
always
will
be
to
bring
you
as
near
to
the
truth
as
we
can
without
the
sad
reality
and
now
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
whether
the
sophist
is
not
visibly
a
magician
and
imitator
of
true
being
or
are
we
still
disposed
to
think
that
he
may
have
a
true
knowledge
of
the
various
matters
about
which
he
disputes
theaetetus
but
how
can
he
stranger
is
there
any
doubt
after
what
has
been
said
that
he
is
to
be
located
in
one
of
the
divisions
of
children
play
stranger
then
we
must
place
him
in
the
class
of
magicians
and
mimics
theaetetus
certainly
we
must
stranger
and
now
our
business
is
not
to
let
the
animal
out
for
we
have
got
him
in
a
sort
of
dialectical
net
and
there
is
one
thing
which
he
decidedly
will
not
escape
theaetetus
what
is
that
stranger
the
inference
that
he
is
a
juggler
theaetetus
precisely
my
own
opinion
of
him
stranger
then
clearly
we
ought
as
soon
as
possible
to
divide
the
art
and
go
down
into
the
net
and
if
the
sophist
does
not
run
away
from
us
to
seize
him
according
to
orders
and
deliver
him
over
to
reason
who
is
the
lord
of
the
hunt
and
proclaim
the
capture
of
him
and
if
he
creeps
into
the
recesses
of
the
imitative
art
and
secretes
himself
in
one
of
them
to
divide
again
and
follow
him
up
until
in
some
of
imitation
he
is
caught
for
our
method
of
tackling
each
and
all
is
one
which
neither
he
nor
any
other
creature
will
ever
escape
in
triumph
theaetetus
well
said
and
let
us
do
as
you
propose
stranger
well
then
pursuing
the
same
analytic
method
as
before
i
think
that
i
can
discern
two
divisions
of
the
imitative
art
but
i
am
not
as
yet
able
to
see
in
which
of
them
the
desired
form
is
to
be
found
theaetetus
will
you
tell
me
first
what
are
the
two
divisions
of
which
you
are
speaking
stranger
one
is
the
art
of
generally
a
likeness
of
anything
is
made
by
producing
a
copy
which
is
executed
according
to
the
proportions
of
the
original
similar
in
length
and
breadth
and
depth
each
thing
receiving
also
its
appropriate
colour
theaetetus
is
not
this
always
the
aim
of
imitation
stranger
not
always
in
works
either
of
sculpture
or
of
painting
which
are
of
any
magnitude
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
deception
for
artists
were
to
give
the
true
proportions
of
their
fair
works
the
upper
part
which
is
farther
off
would
appear
to
be
out
of
proportion
in
comparison
with
the
lower
which
is
nearer
and
so
they
give
up
the
truth
in
their
images
and
make
only
the
proportions
which
appear
to
be
beautiful
disregarding
the
real
ones
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
that
which
being
other
is
also
like
may
we
not
fairly
call
a
likeness
or
image
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
may
we
not
as
i
did
just
now
call
that
part
of
the
imitative
art
which
is
concerned
with
making
such
images
the
art
of
theaetetus
let
that
be
the
name
stranger
and
what
shall
we
call
those
resemblances
of
the
beautiful
which
appear
such
owing
to
the
unfavourable
position
of
the
spectator
whereas
if
a
person
had
the
power
of
getting
a
correct
view
of
works
of
such
magnitude
they
would
appear
not
even
like
that
to
which
they
profess
to
be
like
may
we
not
call
these
since
they
appear
only
and
are
not
really
like
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
there
is
a
great
deal
of
this
kind
of
thing
in
painting
and
in
all
imitation
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
and
may
we
not
fairly
call
the
sort
of
art
which
produces
an
appearance
and
not
an
image
phantastic
art
theaetetus
most
fairly
stranger
these
then
are
the
two
kinds
of
the
art
of
making
likenesses
and
phantastic
or
the
art
of
making
appearances
theaetetus
true
stranger
i
was
doubtful
before
in
which
of
them
i
should
place
the
sophist
nor
am
i
even
now
able
to
see
clearly
verily
he
is
a
wonderful
and
inscrutable
creature
and
now
in
the
cleverest
manner
he
has
got
into
an
impossible
place
theaetetus
yes
he
has
stranger
do
you
speak
advisedly
or
are
you
carried
away
at
the
moment
by
the
habit
of
assenting
into
giving
a
hasty
answer
theaetetus
may
i
ask
to
what
you
are
referring
stranger
my
dear
friend
we
are
engaged
in
a
very
difficult
speculation
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
for
how
a
thing
can
appear
and
seem
and
not
be
or
how
a
man
can
say
a
thing
which
is
not
true
has
always
been
and
still
remains
a
very
perplexing
question
can
any
one
say
or
think
that
falsehood
really
exists
and
avoid
being
caught
in
a
contradiction
indeed
theaetetus
the
task
is
a
difficult
one
theaetetus
why
stranger
he
who
says
that
falsehood
exists
has
the
audacity
to
assert
the
being
of
for
this
is
implied
in
the
possibility
of
falsehood
but
my
boy
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
boy
the
great
parmenides
protested
against
this
doctrine
and
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
continued
to
inculcate
the
same
lesson
always
repeating
both
in
verse
and
out
of
verse
your
mind
from
this
way
of
enquiry
for
never
will
you
show
that
is
such
is
his
testimony
which
is
confirmed
by
the
very
expression
when
sifted
a
little
would
you
object
to
begin
with
the
consideration
of
the
words
themselves
theaetetus
never
mind
about
me
i
am
only
desirous
that
you
should
carry
on
the
argument
in
the
best
way
and
that
you
should
take
me
with
you
stranger
very
good
and
now
say
do
we
venture
to
utter
the
forbidden
word
theaetetus
certainly
we
do
stranger
let
us
be
serious
then
and
consider
the
question
neither
in
strife
nor
play
suppose
that
one
of
the
hearers
of
parmenides
was
asked
what
is
the
term
to
be
applied
do
you
know
what
sort
of
object
he
would
single
out
in
reply
and
what
answer
he
would
make
to
the
enquirer
theaetetus
that
is
a
difficult
question
and
one
not
to
be
answered
at
all
by
a
person
like
myself
stranger
there
is
at
any
rate
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
predicate
is
not
applicable
to
any
being
theaetetus
none
certainly
stranger
and
if
not
to
being
then
not
to
something
theaetetus
of
course
not
stranger
it
is
also
plain
that
in
speaking
of
something
we
speak
of
being
for
to
speak
of
an
abstract
something
naked
and
isolated
from
all
being
is
impossible
theaetetus
impossible
stranger
you
mean
by
assenting
to
imply
that
he
who
says
something
must
say
some
one
thing
theaetetus
yes
stranger
some
in
the
singular
ti
you
would
say
is
the
sign
of
one
some
in
the
dual
tine
of
two
some
in
the
plural
tines
of
many
theaetetus
exactly
stranger
then
he
who
says
something
must
say
absolutely
nothing
theaetetus
most
assuredly
stranger
and
as
we
can
not
admit
that
a
man
speaks
and
says
nothing
he
who
says
does
not
speak
at
all
theaetetus
the
difficulty
of
the
argument
can
no
further
go
stranger
not
yet
my
friend
is
the
time
for
such
a
word
for
there
still
remains
of
all
perplexities
the
first
and
greatest
touching
the
very
foundation
of
the
matter
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
do
not
be
afraid
to
speak
stranger
to
that
which
is
may
be
attributed
some
other
thing
which
is
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
can
anything
which
is
be
attributed
to
that
which
is
not
theaetetus
impossible
stranger
and
all
number
is
to
be
reckoned
among
things
which
are
theaetetus
yes
surely
number
if
anything
has
a
real
existence
stranger
then
we
must
not
attempt
to
attribute
to
number
either
in
the
singular
or
plural
theaetetus
the
argument
implies
that
we
should
be
wrong
in
doing
so
stranger
but
how
can
a
man
either
express
in
words
or
even
conceive
in
thought
things
which
are
not
or
a
thing
which
is
not
without
number
theaetetus
how
indeed
stranger
when
we
speak
of
things
which
are
not
are
we
not
attributing
plurality
to
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
on
the
other
hand
when
we
say
is
not
do
we
not
attribute
unity
theaetetus
manifestly
stranger
nevertheless
we
maintain
that
you
may
not
and
ought
not
to
attribute
being
to
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
do
you
see
then
that
in
itself
can
neither
be
spoken
uttered
or
thought
but
that
it
is
unthinkable
unutterable
unspeakable
indescribable
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
but
if
so
i
was
wrong
in
telling
you
just
now
that
the
difficulty
which
was
coming
is
the
greatest
of
all
theaetetus
what
is
there
a
greater
still
behind
stranger
well
i
am
surprised
after
what
has
been
said
already
that
you
do
not
see
the
difficulty
in
which
he
who
would
refute
the
notion
of
is
involved
for
he
is
compelled
to
contradict
himself
as
soon
as
he
makes
the
attempt
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
speak
more
clearly
stranger
do
not
expect
clearness
from
me
for
i
who
maintain
that
has
no
part
either
in
the
one
or
many
just
now
spoke
and
am
still
speaking
of
as
one
for
i
say
do
you
understand
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
a
little
while
ago
i
said
that
is
unutterable
unspeakable
indescribable
do
you
follow
theaetetus
i
do
after
a
fashion
stranger
when
i
introduced
the
word
did
i
not
contradict
what
i
said
before
theaetetus
clearly
stranger
and
in
using
the
singular
verb
did
i
not
speak
of
as
one
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
when
i
spoke
of
as
indescribable
and
unspeakable
and
unutterable
in
using
each
of
these
words
in
the
singular
did
i
not
refer
to
as
one
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
yet
we
say
that
strictly
speaking
it
should
not
be
defined
as
one
or
many
and
should
not
even
be
called
for
the
use
of
the
word
would
imply
a
form
of
unity
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
how
then
can
any
one
put
any
faith
in
me
for
now
as
always
i
am
unequal
to
the
refutation
of
and
therefore
as
i
was
saying
do
not
look
to
me
for
the
right
way
of
speaking
about
but
come
let
us
try
the
experiment
with
you
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
make
a
noble
effort
as
becomes
youth
and
endeavour
with
all
your
might
to
speak
of
in
a
right
manner
without
introducing
into
it
either
existence
or
unity
or
plurality
theaetetus
it
would
be
a
strange
boldness
in
me
which
would
attempt
the
task
when
i
see
you
thus
discomfited
stranger
say
no
more
of
ourselves
but
until
we
find
some
one
or
other
who
can
speak
of
without
number
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
sophist
is
a
clever
rogue
who
will
not
be
got
out
of
his
hole
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
and
if
we
say
to
him
that
he
professes
an
art
of
making
appearances
he
will
grapple
with
us
and
retort
our
argument
upon
ourselves
and
when
we
call
him
an
he
will
say
what
do
you
mean
at
all
by
an
image
and
i
should
like
to
know
theaetetus
how
we
can
possibly
answer
the
younker
question
theaetetus
we
shall
doubtless
tell
him
of
the
images
which
are
reflected
in
water
or
in
mirrors
also
of
sculptures
pictures
and
other
duplicates
stranger
i
see
theaetetus
that
you
have
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
sophist
theaetetus
why
do
you
think
so
stranger
he
will
make
believe
to
have
his
eyes
shut
or
to
have
none
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
when
you
tell
him
of
something
existing
in
a
mirror
or
in
sculpture
and
address
him
as
though
he
had
eyes
he
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
and
will
pretend
that
he
knows
nothing
of
mirrors
and
streams
or
of
sight
at
all
he
will
say
that
he
is
asking
about
an
idea
theaetetus
what
can
he
mean
stranger
the
common
notion
pervading
all
these
objects
which
you
speak
of
as
many
and
yet
call
by
the
single
name
of
image
as
though
it
were
the
unity
under
which
they
were
all
included
how
will
you
maintain
your
ground
against
him
theaetetus
how
stranger
can
i
describe
an
image
except
as
something
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
the
true
stranger
and
do
you
mean
this
something
to
be
some
other
true
thing
or
what
do
you
mean
theaetetus
certainly
not
another
true
thing
but
only
a
resemblance
stranger
and
you
mean
by
true
that
which
really
is
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
the
not
true
is
that
which
is
the
opposite
of
the
true
theaetetus
exactly
stranger
a
resemblance
then
is
not
really
real
if
as
you
say
not
true
theaetetus
nay
but
it
is
in
a
certain
sense
stranger
you
mean
to
say
not
in
a
true
sense
theaetetus
yes
it
is
in
reality
only
an
image
stranger
then
what
we
call
an
image
is
in
reality
really
unreal
theaetetus
in
what
a
strange
complication
of
being
and
we
are
involved
stranger
strange
i
should
think
so
see
how
by
his
reciprocation
of
opposites
the
sophist
has
compelled
us
quite
against
our
will
to
admit
the
existence
of
theaetetus
yes
indeed
i
see
stranger
the
difficulty
is
how
to
define
his
art
without
falling
into
a
contradiction
theaetetus
how
do
you
mean
and
where
does
the
danger
lie
stranger
when
we
say
that
he
deceives
us
with
an
illusion
and
that
his
art
is
illusory
do
we
mean
that
our
soul
is
led
by
his
art
to
think
falsely
or
what
do
we
mean
theaetetus
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
said
stranger
again
false
opinion
is
that
form
of
opinion
which
thinks
the
opposite
of
the
truth
you
would
assent
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
you
mean
to
say
that
false
opinion
thinks
what
is
not
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
does
false
opinion
think
that
things
which
are
not
are
not
or
that
in
a
certain
sense
they
are
theaetetus
things
that
are
not
must
be
imagined
to
exist
in
a
certain
sense
if
any
degree
of
falsehood
is
to
be
possible
stranger
and
does
not
false
opinion
also
think
that
things
which
most
certainly
exist
do
not
exist
at
all
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
here
again
is
falsehood
theaetetus
falsehood
yes
stranger
and
in
like
manner
a
false
proposition
will
be
deemed
to
be
one
which
asserts
the
of
things
which
are
and
the
existence
of
things
which
are
not
theaetetus
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
a
false
proposition
can
arise
stranger
there
is
not
but
the
sophist
will
deny
these
statements
and
indeed
how
can
any
rational
man
assent
to
them
when
the
very
expressions
which
we
have
just
used
were
before
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
unutterable
unspeakable
indescribable
unthinkable
do
you
see
his
point
theaetetus
theaetetus
of
course
he
will
say
that
we
are
contradicting
ourselves
when
we
hazard
the
assertion
that
falsehood
exists
in
opinion
and
in
words
for
in
maintaining
this
we
are
compelled
over
and
over
again
to
assert
being
of
which
we
admitted
just
now
to
be
an
utter
impossibility
stranger
how
well
you
remember
and
now
it
is
high
time
to
hold
a
consultation
as
to
what
we
ought
to
do
about
the
sophist
for
if
we
persist
in
looking
for
him
in
the
class
of
false
workers
and
magicians
you
see
that
the
handles
for
objection
and
the
difficulties
which
will
arise
are
very
numerous
and
obvious
theaetetus
they
are
indeed
stranger
we
have
gone
through
but
a
very
small
portion
of
them
and
they
are
really
infinite
theaetetus
if
that
is
the
case
we
can
not
possibly
catch
the
sophist
stranger
shall
we
then
be
so
as
to
give
him
up
theaetetus
certainly
not
i
should
say
if
we
can
get
the
slightest
hold
upon
him
stranger
will
you
then
forgive
me
and
as
your
words
imply
not
be
altogether
displeased
if
i
flinch
a
little
from
the
grasp
of
such
a
sturdy
argument
theaetetus
to
be
sure
i
will
stranger
i
have
a
yet
more
urgent
request
to
make
theaetetus
which
is
stranger
that
you
will
promise
not
to
regard
me
as
a
parricide
theaetetus
and
why
stranger
because
in
i
must
test
the
philosophy
of
my
father
parmenides
and
try
to
prove
by
main
force
that
in
a
certain
sense
is
and
that
being
on
the
other
hand
is
not
theaetetus
some
attempt
of
the
kind
is
clearly
needed
stranger
yes
a
blind
man
as
they
say
might
see
that
and
unless
these
questions
are
decided
in
one
way
or
another
no
one
when
he
speaks
of
false
words
or
false
opinion
or
idols
or
images
or
imitations
or
appearances
or
about
the
arts
which
are
concerned
with
them
can
avoid
falling
into
ridiculous
contradictions
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
and
therefore
i
must
venture
to
lay
hands
on
my
argument
for
if
i
am
to
be
i
shall
have
to
give
the
matter
up
theaetetus
nothing
in
the
world
should
ever
induce
us
to
do
so
stranger
i
have
a
third
little
request
which
i
wish
to
make
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
you
heard
me
say
what
i
have
always
felt
and
still
feel
that
i
have
no
heart
for
this
argument
theaetetus
i
did
stranger
i
tremble
at
the
thought
of
what
i
have
said
and
expect
that
you
will
deem
me
mad
when
you
hear
of
my
sudden
changes
and
shiftings
let
me
therefore
observe
that
i
am
examining
the
question
entirely
out
of
regard
for
you
theaetetus
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
fear
that
i
shall
impute
any
impropriety
to
you
if
you
attempt
this
refutation
and
proof
take
heart
therefore
and
proceed
stranger
and
where
shall
i
begin
the
perilous
enterprise
i
think
that
the
road
which
i
must
take
is
theaetetus
which
let
me
hear
stranger
i
think
that
we
had
better
first
of
all
consider
the
points
which
at
present
are
regarded
as
lest
we
may
have
fallen
into
some
confusion
and
be
too
ready
to
assent
to
one
another
fancying
that
we
are
quite
clear
about
them
theaetetus
say
more
distinctly
what
you
mean
stranger
i
think
that
parmenides
and
all
ever
yet
undertook
to
determine
the
number
and
nature
of
existences
talked
to
us
in
rather
a
light
and
easy
strain
theaetetus
how
stranger
as
if
we
had
been
children
to
whom
they
repeated
each
his
own
mythus
or
story
one
said
that
there
were
three
principles
and
that
at
one
time
there
was
war
between
certain
of
them
and
then
again
there
was
peace
and
they
were
married
and
begat
children
and
brought
them
up
and
another
spoke
of
two
principles
a
moist
and
a
dry
or
a
hot
and
a
cold
and
made
them
marry
and
cohabit
the
eleatics
however
in
our
part
of
the
world
say
that
all
things
are
many
in
name
but
in
nature
one
this
is
their
mythus
which
goes
back
to
xenophanes
and
is
even
older
then
there
are
ionian
and
in
more
recent
times
sicilian
muses
who
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
to
unite
the
two
principles
is
safer
and
to
say
that
being
is
one
and
many
and
that
these
are
held
together
by
enmity
and
friendship
ever
parting
ever
meeting
as
the
severer
muses
assert
while
the
gentler
ones
do
not
insist
on
the
perpetual
strife
and
peace
but
admit
a
relaxation
and
alternation
of
them
peace
and
unity
sometimes
prevailing
under
the
sway
of
aphrodite
and
then
again
plurality
and
war
by
reason
of
a
principle
of
strife
whether
any
of
them
spoke
the
truth
in
all
this
is
hard
to
determine
besides
antiquity
and
famous
men
should
have
reverence
and
not
be
liable
to
accusations
so
serious
yet
one
thing
may
be
said
of
them
without
offence
theaetetus
what
thing
stranger
that
they
went
on
their
several
ways
disdaining
to
notice
people
like
ourselves
they
did
not
care
whether
they
took
us
with
them
or
left
us
behind
them
theaetetus
how
do
you
mean
stranger
i
mean
to
say
that
when
they
talk
of
one
two
or
more
elements
which
are
or
have
become
or
are
becoming
or
again
of
heat
mingling
with
cold
assuming
in
some
other
part
of
their
works
separations
and
mixtures
tell
me
theaetetus
do
you
understand
what
they
mean
by
these
expressions
when
i
was
a
younger
man
i
used
to
fancy
that
i
understood
quite
well
what
was
meant
by
the
term
which
is
our
present
subject
of
dispute
and
now
you
see
in
what
a
fix
we
are
about
it
theaetetus
i
see
stranger
and
very
likely
we
have
been
getting
into
the
same
perplexity
about
and
yet
may
fancy
that
when
anybody
utters
the
word
we
understand
him
quite
easily
although
we
do
not
know
about
but
we
may
be
equally
ignorant
of
both
theaetetus
i
dare
say
stranger
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
the
terms
just
mentioned
theaetetus
true
stranger
the
consideration
of
most
of
them
may
be
deferred
but
we
had
better
now
discuss
the
chief
captain
and
leader
of
them
theaetetus
of
what
are
you
speaking
you
clearly
think
that
we
must
first
investigate
what
people
mean
by
the
word
stranger
you
follow
close
at
my
heels
theaetetus
for
the
right
method
i
conceive
will
be
to
call
into
our
presence
the
dualistic
philosophers
and
to
interrogate
them
we
will
say
who
affirm
that
hot
and
cold
or
any
other
two
principles
are
the
universe
what
is
this
term
which
you
apply
to
both
of
them
and
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
both
and
each
of
them
are
how
are
we
to
understand
the
word
are
upon
your
view
are
we
to
suppose
that
there
is
a
third
principle
over
and
above
the
other
two
three
in
all
and
not
two
for
clearly
you
can
not
say
that
one
of
the
two
principles
is
being
and
yet
attribute
being
equally
to
both
of
them
for
if
you
did
whichever
of
the
two
is
identified
with
being
will
comprehend
the
other
and
so
they
will
be
one
and
not
two
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
but
perhaps
you
mean
to
give
the
name
of
to
both
of
them
together
theaetetus
quite
likely
stranger
friends
we
shall
reply
to
them
answer
is
plainly
that
the
two
will
still
be
resolved
into
one
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
then
we
are
in
a
difficulty
please
to
tell
us
what
you
mean
when
you
speak
of
being
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
you
always
from
the
first
understood
your
own
meaning
whereas
we
once
thought
that
we
understood
you
but
now
we
are
in
a
great
strait
please
to
begin
by
explaining
this
matter
to
us
and
let
us
no
longer
fancy
that
we
understand
you
when
we
entirely
misunderstand
you
there
will
be
no
impropriety
in
our
demanding
an
answer
to
this
question
either
of
the
dualists
or
of
the
pluralists
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
and
what
about
the
assertors
of
the
oneness
of
the
all
must
we
not
endeavour
to
ascertain
from
them
what
they
mean
by
theaetetus
by
all
means
stranger
then
let
them
answer
this
question
one
you
say
alone
is
they
will
reply
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
there
is
something
which
you
call
theaetetus
stranger
and
is
being
the
same
as
one
and
do
you
apply
two
names
to
the
same
thing
theaetetus
what
will
be
their
answer
stranger
stranger
it
is
clear
theaetetus
that
he
who
asserts
the
unity
of
being
will
find
a
difficulty
in
answering
this
or
any
other
question
theaetetus
why
so
stranger
to
admit
of
two
names
and
to
affirm
that
there
is
nothing
but
unity
is
surely
ridiculous
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
equally
irrational
to
admit
that
a
name
is
anything
theaetetus
how
so
stranger
to
distinguish
the
name
from
the
thing
implies
duality
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
yet
he
who
identifies
the
name
with
the
thing
will
be
compelled
to
say
that
it
is
the
name
of
nothing
or
if
he
says
that
it
is
the
name
of
something
even
then
the
name
will
only
be
the
name
of
a
name
and
of
nothing
else
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
the
one
will
turn
out
to
be
only
one
of
one
and
being
absolute
unity
will
represent
a
mere
name
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
would
they
say
that
the
whole
is
other
than
the
one
that
is
or
the
same
with
it
theaetetus
to
be
sure
they
would
and
they
actually
say
so
stranger
if
being
is
a
whole
as
parmenides
sings
way
like
unto
the
fullness
of
a
sphere
evenly
balanced
from
the
centre
on
every
side
and
must
needs
be
neither
greater
nor
less
in
any
way
neither
on
this
side
nor
on
that
then
being
has
a
centre
and
extremes
and
having
these
must
also
have
parts
theaetetus
true
stranger
yet
that
which
has
parts
may
have
the
attribute
of
unity
in
all
the
parts
and
in
this
way
being
all
and
a
whole
may
be
one
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
that
of
which
this
is
the
condition
can
not
be
absolute
unity
theaetetus
why
not
stranger
because
according
to
right
reason
that
which
is
truly
one
must
be
affirmed
to
be
absolutely
indivisible
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
but
this
indivisible
if
made
up
of
many
parts
will
contradict
reason
theaetetus
i
understand
stranger
shall
we
say
that
being
is
one
and
a
whole
because
it
has
the
attribute
of
unity
or
shall
we
say
that
being
is
not
a
whole
at
all
theaetetus
that
is
a
hard
alternative
to
offer
stranger
most
true
for
being
having
in
a
certain
sense
the
attribute
of
one
is
yet
proved
not
to
be
the
same
as
one
and
the
all
is
therefore
more
than
one
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
yet
if
being
be
not
a
whole
through
having
the
attribute
of
unity
and
there
be
such
a
thing
as
an
absolute
whole
being
lacks
something
of
its
own
nature
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
upon
this
view
again
being
having
a
defect
of
being
will
become
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
again
the
all
becomes
more
than
one
for
being
and
the
whole
will
each
have
their
separate
nature
theaetetus
yes
stranger
but
if
the
whole
does
not
exist
at
all
all
the
previous
difficulties
remain
the
same
and
there
will
be
the
further
difficulty
that
besides
having
no
being
being
can
never
have
come
into
being
theaetetus
why
so
stranger
because
that
which
comes
into
being
always
comes
into
being
as
a
whole
so
that
he
who
does
not
give
whole
a
place
among
beings
can
not
speak
either
of
essence
or
generation
as
existing
theaetetus
yes
that
certainly
appears
to
be
true
stranger
again
how
can
that
which
is
not
a
whole
have
any
quantity
for
that
which
is
of
a
certain
quantity
must
necessarily
be
the
whole
of
that
quantity
theaetetus
exactly
stranger
and
there
will
be
innumerable
other
points
each
of
them
causing
infinite
trouble
to
him
who
says
that
being
is
either
one
or
two
theaetetus
the
difficulties
which
are
dawning
upon
us
prove
this
for
one
objection
connects
with
another
and
they
are
always
involving
what
has
preceded
in
a
greater
and
worse
perplexity
stranger
we
are
far
from
having
exhausted
the
more
exact
thinkers
who
treat
of
being
and
but
let
us
be
content
to
leave
them
and
proceed
to
view
those
who
speak
less
precisely
and
we
shall
find
as
the
result
of
all
that
the
nature
of
being
is
quite
as
difficult
to
comprehend
as
that
of
theaetetus
then
now
we
will
go
to
the
others
stranger
there
appears
to
be
a
sort
of
war
of
giants
and
gods
going
on
amongst
them
they
are
fighting
with
one
another
about
the
nature
of
essence
theaetetus
how
is
that
stranger
some
of
them
are
dragging
down
all
things
from
heaven
and
from
the
unseen
to
earth
and
they
literally
grasp
in
their
hands
rocks
and
oaks
of
these
they
lay
hold
and
obstinately
maintain
that
the
things
only
which
can
be
touched
or
handled
have
being
or
essence
because
they
define
being
and
body
as
one
and
if
any
one
else
says
that
what
is
not
a
body
exists
they
altogether
despise
him
and
will
hear
of
nothing
but
body
theaetetus
i
have
often
met
with
such
men
and
terrible
fellows
they
are
stranger
and
that
is
the
reason
why
their
opponents
cautiously
defend
themselves
from
above
out
of
an
unseen
world
mightily
contending
that
true
essence
consists
of
certain
intelligible
and
incorporeal
ideas
the
bodies
of
the
materialists
which
by
them
are
maintained
to
be
the
very
truth
they
break
up
into
little
bits
by
their
arguments
and
affirm
them
to
be
not
essence
but
generation
and
motion
between
the
two
armies
theaetetus
there
is
always
an
endless
conflict
raging
concerning
these
matters
theaetetus
true
stranger
let
us
ask
each
party
in
turn
to
give
an
account
of
that
which
they
call
essence
theaetetus
how
shall
we
get
it
out
of
them
stranger
with
those
who
make
being
to
consist
in
ideas
there
will
be
less
difficulty
for
they
are
civil
people
enough
but
there
will
be
very
great
difficulty
or
rather
an
absolute
impossibility
in
getting
an
opinion
out
of
those
who
drag
everything
down
to
matter
shall
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
theaetetus
what
stranger
let
us
if
we
can
really
improve
them
but
if
this
is
not
possible
let
us
imagine
them
to
be
better
than
they
are
and
more
willing
to
answer
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
argument
and
then
their
opinion
will
be
more
worth
having
for
that
which
better
men
acknowledge
has
more
weight
than
that
which
is
acknowledged
by
inferior
men
moreover
we
are
no
respecters
of
persons
but
seekers
after
truth
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
then
now
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
improved
let
us
ask
them
to
state
their
views
and
do
you
interpret
them
theaetetus
agreed
stranger
let
them
say
whether
they
would
admit
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
mortal
animal
theaetetus
of
course
they
would
stranger
and
do
they
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
a
body
having
a
soul
theaetetus
certainly
they
do
stranger
meaning
to
say
that
the
soul
is
something
which
exists
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
do
they
not
say
that
one
soul
is
just
and
another
unjust
and
that
one
soul
is
wise
and
another
foolish
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
that
the
just
and
wise
soul
becomes
just
and
wise
by
the
possession
of
justice
and
wisdom
and
the
opposite
under
opposite
circumstances
theaetetus
yes
they
do
stranger
but
surely
that
which
may
be
present
or
may
be
absent
will
be
admitted
by
them
to
exist
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
allowing
that
justice
wisdom
the
other
virtues
and
their
opposites
exist
as
well
as
a
soul
in
which
they
inhere
do
they
affirm
any
of
them
to
be
visible
and
tangible
or
are
they
all
invisible
theaetetus
they
would
say
that
hardly
any
of
them
are
visible
stranger
and
would
they
say
that
they
are
corporeal
theaetetus
they
would
distinguish
the
soul
would
be
said
by
them
to
have
a
body
but
as
to
the
other
qualities
of
justice
wisdom
and
the
like
about
which
you
asked
they
would
not
venture
either
to
deny
their
existence
or
to
maintain
that
they
were
all
corporeal
stranger
verily
theaetetus
i
perceive
a
great
improvement
in
them
the
real
aborigines
children
of
the
dragon
teeth
would
have
been
deterred
by
no
shame
at
all
but
would
have
obstinately
asserted
that
nothing
is
which
they
are
not
able
to
squeeze
in
their
hands
theaetetus
that
is
pretty
much
their
notion
stranger
let
us
push
the
question
for
if
they
will
admit
that
any
even
the
smallest
particle
of
being
is
incorporeal
it
is
enough
they
must
then
say
what
that
nature
is
which
is
common
to
both
the
corporeal
and
incorporeal
and
which
they
have
in
their
mind
eye
when
they
say
of
both
of
them
that
they
perhaps
they
may
be
in
a
difficulty
and
if
this
is
the
case
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
may
accept
a
notion
of
ours
respecting
the
nature
of
being
having
nothing
of
their
own
to
offer
theaetetus
what
is
the
notion
tell
me
and
we
shall
soon
see
stranger
my
notion
would
be
that
anything
which
possesses
any
sort
of
power
to
affect
another
or
to
be
affected
by
another
if
only
for
a
single
moment
however
trifling
the
cause
and
however
slight
the
effect
has
real
existence
and
i
hold
that
the
definition
of
being
is
simply
power
theaetetus
they
accept
your
suggestion
having
nothing
better
of
their
own
to
offer
stranger
very
good
perhaps
we
as
well
as
they
may
one
day
change
our
minds
but
for
the
present
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
understanding
which
is
established
with
them
theaetetus
agreed
stranger
let
us
now
go
to
the
friends
of
ideas
of
their
opinions
too
you
shall
be
the
interpreter
theaetetus
i
will
stranger
to
them
we
say
you
would
distinguish
essence
from
generation
theaetetus
they
reply
stranger
and
you
would
allow
that
we
participate
in
generation
with
the
body
and
through
perception
but
we
participate
with
the
soul
through
thought
in
true
essence
and
essence
you
would
affirm
to
be
always
the
same
and
immutable
whereas
generation
or
becoming
varies
theaetetus
yes
that
is
what
we
should
affirm
stranger
well
fair
sirs
we
say
to
them
what
is
this
participation
which
you
assert
of
both
do
you
agree
with
our
recent
definition
theaetetus
what
definition
stranger
we
said
that
being
was
an
active
or
passive
energy
arising
out
of
a
certain
power
which
proceeds
from
elements
meeting
with
one
another
perhaps
your
ears
theaetetus
may
fail
to
catch
their
answer
which
i
recognize
because
i
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
it
theaetetus
and
what
is
their
answer
stranger
they
deny
the
truth
of
what
we
were
just
now
saying
to
the
aborigines
about
existence
theaetetus
what
was
that
stranger
any
power
of
doing
or
suffering
in
a
degree
however
slight
was
held
by
us
to
be
a
sufficient
definition
of
being
theaetetus
true
stranger
they
deny
this
and
say
that
the
power
of
doing
or
suffering
is
confined
to
becoming
and
that
neither
power
is
applicable
to
being
theaetetus
and
is
there
not
some
truth
in
what
they
say
stranger
yes
but
our
reply
will
be
that
we
want
to
ascertain
from
them
more
distinctly
whether
they
further
admit
that
the
soul
knows
and
that
being
or
essence
is
known
theaetetus
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
say
so
stranger
and
is
knowing
and
being
known
doing
or
suffering
or
both
or
is
the
one
doing
and
the
other
suffering
or
has
neither
any
share
in
either
theaetetus
clearly
neither
has
any
share
in
either
for
if
they
say
anything
else
they
will
contradict
themselves
stranger
i
understand
but
they
will
allow
that
if
to
know
is
active
then
of
course
to
be
known
is
passive
and
on
this
view
being
in
so
far
as
it
is
known
is
acted
upon
by
knowledge
and
is
therefore
in
motion
for
that
which
is
in
a
state
of
rest
can
not
be
acted
upon
as
we
affirm
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
o
heavens
can
we
ever
be
made
to
believe
that
motion
and
life
and
soul
and
mind
are
not
present
with
perfect
being
can
we
imagine
that
being
is
devoid
of
life
and
mind
and
exists
in
awful
unmeaningness
an
everlasting
fixture
theaetetus
that
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
admit
stranger
stranger
but
shall
we
say
that
has
mind
and
not
life
theaetetus
how
is
that
possible
stranger
or
shall
we
say
that
both
inhere
in
perfect
being
but
that
it
has
no
soul
which
contains
them
theaetetus
and
in
what
other
way
can
it
contain
them
stranger
or
that
being
has
mind
and
life
and
soul
but
although
endowed
with
soul
remains
absolutely
unmoved
theaetetus
all
three
suppositions
appear
to
me
to
be
irrational
stranger
under
being
then
we
must
include
motion
and
that
which
is
moved
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
then
theaetetus
our
inference
is
that
if
there
is
no
motion
neither
is
there
any
mind
anywhere
or
about
anything
or
belonging
to
any
one
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
yet
this
equally
follows
if
we
grant
that
all
things
are
in
motion
upon
this
view
too
mind
has
no
existence
theaetetus
how
so
stranger
do
you
think
that
sameness
of
condition
and
mode
and
subject
could
ever
exist
without
a
principle
of
rest
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
can
you
see
how
without
them
mind
could
exist
or
come
into
existence
anywhere
theaetetus
no
stranger
and
surely
contend
we
must
in
every
possible
way
against
him
who
would
annihilate
knowledge
and
reason
and
mind
and
yet
ventures
to
speak
confidently
about
anything
theaetetus
yes
with
all
our
might
stranger
then
the
philosopher
who
has
the
truest
reverence
for
these
qualities
can
not
possibly
accept
the
notion
of
those
who
say
that
the
whole
is
at
rest
either
as
unity
or
in
many
forms
and
he
will
be
utterly
deaf
to
those
who
assert
universal
motion
as
children
say
entreatingly
us
both
so
he
will
include
both
the
moveable
and
immoveable
in
his
definition
of
being
and
all
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
and
now
do
we
seem
to
have
gained
a
fair
notion
of
being
theaetetus
yes
truly
stranger
alas
theaetetus
methinks
that
we
are
now
only
beginning
to
see
the
real
difficulty
of
the
enquiry
into
the
nature
of
it
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
o
my
friend
do
you
not
see
that
nothing
can
exceed
our
ignorance
and
yet
we
fancy
that
we
are
saying
something
good
theaetetus
i
certainly
thought
that
we
were
and
i
do
not
at
all
understand
how
we
never
found
out
our
desperate
case
stranger
reflect
after
having
made
these
admissions
may
we
not
be
justly
asked
the
same
questions
which
we
ourselves
were
asking
of
those
who
said
that
all
was
hot
and
cold
theaetetus
what
were
they
will
you
recall
them
to
my
mind
stranger
to
be
sure
i
will
and
i
will
remind
you
of
them
by
putting
the
same
questions
to
you
which
i
did
to
them
and
then
we
shall
get
on
theaetetus
true
stranger
would
you
not
say
that
rest
and
motion
are
in
the
most
entire
opposition
to
one
another
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
and
yet
you
would
say
that
both
and
either
of
them
equally
are
theaetetus
i
should
stranger
and
when
you
admit
that
both
or
either
of
them
are
do
you
mean
to
say
that
both
or
either
of
them
are
in
motion
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
or
do
you
wish
to
imply
that
they
are
both
at
rest
when
you
say
that
they
are
theaetetus
of
course
not
stranger
then
you
conceive
of
being
as
some
third
and
distinct
nature
under
which
rest
and
motion
are
alike
included
and
observing
that
they
both
participate
in
being
you
declare
that
they
are
theaetetus
truly
we
seem
to
have
an
intimation
that
being
is
some
third
thing
when
we
say
that
rest
and
motion
are
stranger
then
being
is
not
the
combination
of
rest
and
motion
but
something
different
from
them
theaetetus
so
it
would
appear
stranger
being
then
according
to
its
own
nature
is
neither
in
motion
nor
at
rest
theaetetus
that
is
very
much
the
truth
stranger
where
then
is
a
man
to
look
for
help
who
would
have
any
clear
or
fixed
notion
of
being
in
his
mind
theaetetus
where
indeed
stranger
i
scarcely
think
that
he
can
look
anywhere
for
that
which
is
not
in
motion
must
be
at
rest
and
again
that
which
is
not
at
rest
must
be
in
motion
but
being
is
placed
outside
of
both
these
classes
is
this
possible
theaetetus
utterly
impossible
stranger
here
then
is
another
thing
which
we
ought
to
bear
in
mind
theaetetus
what
stranger
when
we
were
asked
to
what
we
were
to
assign
the
appellation
of
we
were
in
the
greatest
difficulty
do
you
remember
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
and
are
we
not
now
in
as
great
a
difficulty
about
being
theaetetus
i
should
say
stranger
that
we
are
in
one
which
is
if
possible
even
greater
stranger
then
let
us
acknowledge
the
difficulty
and
as
being
and
are
involved
in
the
same
perplexity
there
is
hope
that
when
the
one
appears
more
or
less
distinctly
the
other
will
equally
appear
and
if
we
are
able
to
see
neither
there
may
still
be
a
chance
of
steering
our
way
in
between
them
without
any
great
discredit
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
let
us
enquire
then
how
we
come
to
predicate
many
names
of
the
same
thing
theaetetus
give
an
example
stranger
i
mean
that
we
speak
of
man
for
example
under
many
names
that
we
attribute
to
him
colours
and
forms
and
magnitudes
and
virtues
and
vices
in
all
of
which
instances
and
in
ten
thousand
others
we
not
only
speak
of
him
as
a
man
but
also
as
good
and
having
numberless
other
attributes
and
in
the
same
way
anything
else
which
we
originally
supposed
to
be
one
is
described
by
us
as
many
and
under
many
names
theaetetus
that
is
true
stranger
and
thus
we
provide
a
rich
feast
for
tyros
whether
young
or
old
for
there
is
nothing
easier
than
to
argue
that
the
one
can
not
be
many
or
the
many
one
and
great
is
their
delight
in
denying
that
a
man
is
good
for
man
they
insist
is
man
and
good
is
good
i
dare
say
that
you
have
met
with
persons
who
take
an
interest
in
such
matters
they
are
often
elderly
men
whose
meagre
sense
is
thrown
into
amazement
by
these
discoveries
of
theirs
which
they
believe
to
be
the
height
of
wisdom
theaetetus
certainly
i
have
stranger
then
not
to
exclude
any
one
who
has
ever
speculated
at
all
upon
the
nature
of
being
let
us
put
our
questions
to
them
as
well
as
to
our
former
friends
theaetetus
what
questions
stranger
shall
we
refuse
to
attribute
being
to
motion
and
rest
or
anything
to
anything
and
assume
that
they
do
not
mingle
and
are
incapable
of
participating
in
one
another
or
shall
we
gather
all
into
one
class
of
things
communicable
with
one
another
or
are
some
things
communicable
and
others
not
which
of
these
alternatives
theaetetus
will
they
prefer
theaetetus
i
have
nothing
to
answer
on
their
behalf
suppose
that
you
take
all
these
hypotheses
in
turn
and
see
what
are
the
consequences
which
follow
from
each
of
them
stranger
very
good
and
first
let
us
assume
them
to
say
that
nothing
is
capable
of
participating
in
anything
else
in
any
respect
in
that
case
rest
and
motion
can
not
participate
in
being
at
all
theaetetus
they
can
not
stranger
but
would
either
of
them
be
if
not
participating
in
being
theaetetus
no
stranger
then
by
this
admission
everything
is
instantly
overturned
as
well
the
doctrine
of
universal
motion
as
of
universal
rest
and
also
the
doctrine
of
those
who
distribute
being
into
immutable
and
everlasting
kinds
for
all
these
add
on
a
notion
of
being
some
affirming
that
things
truly
in
motion
and
others
that
they
truly
at
rest
theaetetus
just
so
stranger
again
those
who
would
at
one
time
compound
and
at
another
resolve
all
things
whether
making
them
into
one
and
out
of
one
creating
infinity
or
dividing
them
into
finite
elements
and
forming
compounds
out
of
these
whether
they
suppose
the
processes
of
creation
to
be
successive
or
continuous
would
be
talking
nonsense
in
all
this
if
there
were
no
admixture
theaetetus
true
stranger
most
ridiculous
of
all
will
the
men
themselves
be
who
want
to
carry
out
the
argument
and
yet
forbid
us
to
call
anything
because
participating
in
some
affection
from
another
by
the
name
of
that
other
theaetetus
why
so
stranger
why
because
they
are
compelled
to
use
the
words
be
others
itself
and
ten
thousand
more
which
they
can
not
give
up
but
must
make
the
connecting
links
of
discourse
and
therefore
they
do
not
require
to
be
refuted
by
others
but
their
enemy
as
the
saying
is
inhabits
the
same
house
with
them
they
are
always
carrying
about
with
them
an
adversary
like
the
wonderful
ventriloquist
eurycles
who
out
of
their
own
bellies
audibly
contradicts
them
theaetetus
precisely
so
a
very
true
and
exact
illustration
stranger
and
now
if
we
suppose
that
all
things
have
the
power
of
communion
with
one
another
what
will
follow
theaetetus
even
i
can
solve
that
riddle
stranger
how
theaetetus
why
because
motion
itself
would
be
at
rest
and
rest
again
in
motion
if
they
could
be
attributed
to
one
another
stranger
but
this
is
utterly
impossible
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
then
only
the
third
hypothesis
remains
theaetetus
true
stranger
for
surely
either
all
things
have
communion
with
all
or
nothing
with
any
other
thing
or
some
things
communicate
with
some
things
and
others
not
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
two
out
of
these
three
suppositions
have
been
found
to
be
impossible
theaetetus
yes
stranger
every
one
then
who
desires
to
answer
truly
will
adopt
the
third
and
remaining
hypothesis
of
the
communion
of
some
with
some
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
this
communion
of
some
with
some
may
be
illustrated
by
the
case
of
letters
for
some
letters
do
not
fit
each
other
while
others
do
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
and
the
vowels
especially
are
a
sort
of
bond
which
pervades
all
the
other
letters
so
that
without
a
vowel
one
consonant
can
not
be
joined
to
another
theaetetus
true
stranger
but
does
every
one
know
what
letters
will
unite
with
what
or
is
art
required
in
order
to
do
so
theaetetus
art
is
required
stranger
what
art
theaetetus
the
art
of
grammar
stranger
and
is
not
this
also
true
of
sounds
high
and
low
is
not
he
who
has
the
art
to
know
what
sounds
mingle
a
musician
and
he
who
is
ignorant
not
a
musician
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
we
shall
find
this
to
be
generally
true
of
art
or
the
absence
of
art
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
and
as
classes
are
admitted
by
us
in
like
manner
to
be
some
of
them
capable
and
others
incapable
of
intermixture
must
not
he
who
would
rightly
show
what
kinds
will
unite
and
what
will
not
proceed
by
the
help
of
science
in
the
path
of
argument
and
will
he
not
ask
if
the
connecting
links
are
universal
and
so
capable
of
intermixture
with
all
things
and
again
in
divisions
whether
there
are
not
other
universal
classes
which
make
them
possible
theaetetus
to
be
sure
he
will
require
science
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
very
greatest
of
all
sciences
stranger
how
are
we
to
call
it
by
zeus
have
we
not
lighted
unwittingly
upon
our
free
and
noble
science
and
in
looking
for
the
sophist
have
we
not
entertained
the
philosopher
unawares
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
should
we
not
say
that
the
division
according
to
classes
which
neither
makes
the
same
other
nor
makes
other
the
same
is
the
business
of
the
dialectical
science
theaetetus
that
is
what
we
should
say
stranger
then
surely
he
who
can
divide
rightly
is
able
to
see
clearly
one
form
pervading
a
scattered
multitude
and
many
different
forms
contained
under
one
higher
form
and
again
one
form
knit
together
into
a
single
whole
and
pervading
many
such
wholes
and
many
forms
existing
only
in
separation
and
isolation
this
is
the
knowledge
of
classes
which
determines
where
they
can
have
communion
with
one
another
and
where
not
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
the
art
of
dialectic
would
be
attributed
by
you
only
to
the
philosopher
pure
and
true
theaetetus
who
but
he
can
be
worthy
stranger
in
this
region
we
shall
always
discover
the
philosopher
if
we
look
for
him
like
the
sophist
he
is
not
easily
discovered
but
for
a
different
reason
theaetetus
for
what
reason
stranger
because
the
sophist
runs
away
into
the
darkness
of
in
which
he
has
learned
by
habit
to
feel
about
and
can
not
be
discovered
because
of
the
darkness
of
the
place
is
not
that
true
theaetetus
it
seems
to
be
so
stranger
and
the
philosopher
always
holding
converse
through
reason
with
the
idea
of
being
is
also
dark
from
excess
of
light
for
the
souls
of
the
many
have
no
eye
which
can
endure
the
vision
of
the
divine
theaetetus
yes
that
seems
to
be
quite
as
true
as
the
other
stranger
well
the
philosopher
may
hereafter
be
more
fully
considered
by
us
if
we
are
disposed
but
the
sophist
must
clearly
not
be
allowed
to
escape
until
we
have
had
a
good
look
at
him
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
since
then
we
are
agreed
that
some
classes
have
a
communion
with
one
another
and
others
not
and
some
have
communion
with
a
few
and
others
with
many
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
some
should
not
have
universal
communion
with
all
let
us
now
pursue
the
enquiry
as
the
argument
suggests
not
in
relation
to
all
ideas
lest
the
multitude
of
them
should
confuse
us
but
let
us
select
a
few
of
those
which
are
reckoned
to
be
the
principal
ones
and
consider
their
several
natures
and
their
capacity
of
communion
with
one
another
in
order
that
if
we
are
not
able
to
apprehend
with
perfect
clearness
the
notions
of
being
and
we
may
at
least
not
fall
short
in
the
consideration
of
them
so
far
as
they
come
within
the
scope
of
the
present
enquiry
if
peradventure
we
may
be
allowed
to
assert
the
reality
of
and
yet
escape
unscathed
theaetetus
we
must
do
so
stranger
the
most
important
of
all
the
genera
are
those
which
we
were
just
now
mentioning
being
and
rest
and
motion
theaetetus
yes
by
far
stranger
and
two
of
these
are
as
we
affirm
incapable
of
communion
with
one
another
theaetetus
quite
incapable
stranger
whereas
being
surely
has
communion
with
both
of
them
for
both
of
them
are
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
that
makes
up
three
of
them
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
and
each
of
them
is
other
than
the
remaining
two
but
the
same
with
itself
theaetetus
true
stranger
but
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
two
words
and
are
they
two
new
kinds
other
than
the
three
and
yet
always
of
necessity
intermingling
with
them
and
are
we
to
have
five
kinds
instead
of
three
or
when
we
speak
of
the
same
and
other
are
we
unconsciously
speaking
of
one
of
the
three
first
kinds
theaetetus
very
likely
we
are
stranger
but
surely
motion
and
rest
are
neither
the
other
nor
the
same
theaetetus
how
is
that
stranger
whatever
we
attribute
to
motion
and
rest
in
common
can
not
be
either
of
them
theaetetus
why
not
stranger
because
motion
would
be
at
rest
and
rest
in
motion
for
either
of
them
being
predicated
of
both
will
compel
the
other
to
change
into
the
opposite
of
its
own
nature
because
partaking
of
its
opposite
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
yet
they
surely
both
partake
of
the
same
and
of
the
other
theaetetus
yes
stranger
then
we
must
not
assert
that
motion
any
more
than
rest
is
either
the
same
or
the
other
theaetetus
no
we
must
not
stranger
but
are
we
to
conceive
that
being
and
the
same
are
identical
theaetetus
possibly
stranger
but
if
they
are
identical
then
again
in
saying
that
motion
and
rest
have
being
we
should
also
be
saying
that
they
are
the
same
theaetetus
which
surely
can
not
be
stranger
then
being
and
the
same
can
not
be
one
theaetetus
scarcely
stranger
then
we
may
suppose
the
same
to
be
a
fourth
class
which
is
now
to
be
added
to
the
three
others
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
shall
we
call
the
other
a
fifth
class
or
should
we
consider
being
and
other
to
be
two
names
of
the
same
class
theaetetus
very
likely
stranger
but
you
would
agree
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
existences
are
relative
as
well
as
absolute
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
the
other
is
always
relative
to
other
theaetetus
true
stranger
but
this
would
not
be
the
case
unless
being
and
the
other
entirely
differed
for
if
the
other
like
being
were
absolute
as
well
as
relative
then
there
would
have
been
a
kind
of
other
which
was
not
other
than
other
and
now
we
find
that
what
is
other
must
of
necessity
be
what
it
is
in
relation
to
some
other
theaetetus
that
is
the
true
state
of
the
case
stranger
then
we
must
admit
the
other
as
the
fifth
of
our
selected
classes
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
the
fifth
class
pervades
all
classes
for
they
all
differ
from
one
another
not
by
reason
of
their
own
nature
but
because
they
partake
of
the
idea
of
the
other
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
then
let
us
now
put
the
case
with
reference
to
each
of
the
five
theaetetus
how
stranger
first
there
is
motion
which
we
affirm
to
be
absolutely
than
rest
what
else
can
we
say
theaetetus
it
is
so
stranger
and
therefore
is
not
rest
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
and
yet
is
because
partaking
of
being
theaetetus
true
stranger
again
motion
is
other
than
the
same
theaetetus
just
so
stranger
and
is
therefore
not
the
same
theaetetus
it
is
not
stranger
yet
surely
motion
is
the
same
because
all
things
partake
of
the
same
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
then
we
must
admit
and
not
object
to
say
that
motion
is
the
same
and
is
not
the
same
for
we
do
not
apply
the
terms
and
the
same
in
the
same
sense
but
we
call
it
the
in
relation
to
itself
because
partaking
of
the
same
and
not
the
same
because
having
communion
with
the
other
it
is
thereby
severed
from
the
same
and
has
become
not
that
but
other
and
is
therefore
rightly
spoken
of
as
the
same
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
and
if
absolute
motion
in
any
point
of
view
partook
of
rest
there
would
be
no
absurdity
in
calling
motion
stationary
theaetetus
quite
right
that
is
on
the
supposition
that
some
classes
mingle
with
one
another
and
others
not
stranger
that
such
a
communion
of
kinds
is
according
to
nature
we
had
already
proved
before
we
arrived
at
this
part
of
our
discussion
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
let
us
proceed
then
may
we
not
say
that
motion
is
other
than
the
other
having
been
also
proved
by
us
to
be
other
than
the
same
and
other
than
rest
theaetetus
that
is
certain
stranger
then
according
to
this
view
motion
is
other
and
also
not
other
theaetetus
true
stranger
what
is
the
next
step
shall
we
say
that
motion
is
other
than
the
three
and
not
other
than
the
fourth
for
we
agreed
that
there
are
five
classes
about
and
in
the
sphere
of
which
we
proposed
to
make
enquiry
theaetetus
surely
we
can
not
admit
that
the
number
is
less
than
it
appeared
to
be
just
now
stranger
then
we
may
without
fear
contend
that
motion
is
other
than
being
theaetetus
without
the
least
fear
stranger
the
plain
result
is
that
motion
since
it
partakes
of
being
really
is
and
also
is
not
theaetetus
nothing
can
be
plainer
stranger
then
necessarily
exists
in
the
case
of
motion
and
of
every
class
for
the
nature
of
the
other
entering
into
them
all
makes
each
of
them
other
than
being
and
so
and
therefore
of
all
of
them
in
like
manner
we
may
truly
say
that
they
are
not
and
again
inasmuch
as
they
partake
of
being
that
they
are
and
are
existent
theaetetus
so
we
may
assume
stranger
every
class
then
has
plurality
of
being
and
infinity
of
theaetetus
so
we
must
infer
stranger
and
being
itself
may
be
said
to
be
other
than
the
other
kinds
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
then
we
may
infer
that
being
is
not
in
respect
of
as
many
other
things
as
there
are
for
these
it
is
itself
one
and
is
not
the
other
things
which
are
infinite
in
number
theaetetus
that
is
not
far
from
the
truth
stranger
and
we
must
not
quarrel
with
this
result
since
it
is
of
the
nature
of
classes
to
have
communion
with
one
another
and
if
any
one
denies
our
present
statement
that
being
is
not
etc
let
him
first
argue
with
our
former
conclusion
respecting
the
communion
of
ideas
and
then
he
may
proceed
to
argue
with
what
follows
theaetetus
nothing
can
be
fairer
stranger
let
me
ask
you
to
consider
a
further
question
theaetetus
what
question
stranger
when
we
speak
of
we
speak
i
suppose
not
of
something
opposed
to
being
but
only
different
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
when
we
speak
of
something
as
not
great
does
the
expression
seem
to
you
to
imply
what
is
little
any
more
than
what
is
equal
theaetetus
certainly
not
stranger
the
negative
particles
ou
and
me
when
prefixed
to
words
do
not
imply
opposition
but
only
difference
from
the
words
or
more
correctly
from
the
things
represented
by
the
words
which
follow
them
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
there
is
another
point
to
be
considered
if
you
do
not
object
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
the
nature
of
the
other
appears
to
me
to
be
divided
into
fractions
like
knowledge
theaetetus
how
so
stranger
knowledge
like
the
other
is
one
and
yet
the
various
parts
of
knowledge
have
each
of
them
their
own
particular
name
and
hence
there
are
many
arts
and
kinds
of
knowledge
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
is
not
the
case
the
same
with
the
parts
of
the
other
which
is
also
one
theaetetus
very
likely
but
will
you
tell
me
how
stranger
there
is
some
part
of
the
other
which
is
opposed
to
the
beautiful
theaetetus
there
is
stranger
shall
we
say
that
this
has
or
has
not
a
name
theaetetus
it
has
for
whatever
we
call
is
other
than
the
beautiful
not
than
something
else
stranger
and
now
tell
me
another
thing
theaetetus
what
stranger
is
the
anything
but
this
an
existence
parted
off
from
a
certain
kind
of
existence
and
again
from
another
point
of
view
opposed
to
an
existing
something
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
the
turns
out
to
be
the
opposition
of
being
to
being
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
but
upon
this
view
is
the
beautiful
a
more
real
and
the
a
less
real
existence
theaetetus
not
at
all
stranger
and
the
may
be
said
to
exist
equally
with
the
great
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
in
the
same
way
the
just
must
be
placed
in
the
same
category
with
the
the
one
can
not
be
said
to
have
any
more
existence
than
the
other
theaetetus
true
stranger
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
things
seeing
that
the
nature
of
the
other
has
a
real
existence
the
parts
of
this
nature
must
equally
be
supposed
to
exist
theaetetus
of
course
stranger
then
as
would
appear
the
opposition
of
a
part
of
the
other
and
of
a
part
of
being
to
one
another
is
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
as
truly
essence
as
being
itself
and
implies
not
the
opposite
of
being
but
only
what
is
other
than
being
theaetetus
beyond
question
stranger
what
then
shall
we
call
it
theaetetus
clearly
and
this
is
the
very
nature
for
which
the
sophist
compelled
us
to
search
stranger
and
has
not
this
as
you
were
saying
as
real
an
existence
as
any
other
class
may
i
not
say
with
confidence
that
has
an
assured
existence
and
a
nature
of
its
own
just
as
the
great
was
found
to
be
great
and
the
beautiful
beautiful
and
the
and
the
in
the
same
manner
has
been
found
to
be
and
is
and
is
to
be
reckoned
one
among
the
many
classes
of
being
do
you
theaetetus
still
feel
any
doubt
of
this
theaetetus
none
whatever
stranger
do
you
observe
that
our
scepticism
has
carried
us
beyond
the
range
of
parmenides
prohibition
theaetetus
in
what
stranger
we
have
advanced
to
a
further
point
and
shown
him
more
than
he
forbad
us
to
investigate
theaetetus
how
is
that
stranger
why
because
he
says
never
is
and
do
thou
keep
thy
thoughts
from
this
way
of
enquiry
theaetetus
yes
he
says
so
stranger
whereas
we
have
not
only
proved
that
things
which
are
not
are
but
we
have
shown
what
form
of
being
is
for
we
have
shown
that
the
nature
of
the
other
is
and
is
distributed
over
all
things
in
their
relations
to
one
another
and
whatever
part
of
the
other
is
contrasted
with
being
this
is
precisely
what
we
have
ventured
to
call
theaetetus
and
surely
stranger
we
were
quite
right
stranger
let
not
any
one
say
then
that
while
affirming
the
opposition
of
to
being
we
still
assert
the
being
of
for
as
to
whether
there
is
an
opposite
of
being
to
that
enquiry
we
have
long
said
it
may
or
may
not
be
and
may
or
may
not
be
capable
of
definition
but
as
touching
our
present
account
of
let
a
man
either
convince
us
of
error
or
so
long
as
he
can
not
he
too
must
say
as
we
are
saying
that
there
is
a
communion
of
classes
and
that
being
and
difference
or
other
traverse
all
things
and
mutually
interpenetrate
so
that
the
other
partakes
of
being
and
by
reason
of
this
participation
is
and
yet
is
not
that
of
which
it
partakes
but
other
and
being
other
than
being
it
is
clearly
a
necessity
that
should
be
and
again
being
through
partaking
of
the
other
becomes
a
class
other
than
the
remaining
classes
and
being
other
than
all
of
them
is
not
each
one
of
them
and
is
not
all
the
rest
so
that
undoubtedly
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
cases
in
which
being
is
not
and
all
other
things
whether
regarded
individually
or
collectively
in
many
respects
are
and
in
many
respects
are
not
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
he
who
is
sceptical
of
this
contradiction
must
think
how
he
can
find
something
better
to
say
or
if
he
sees
a
puzzle
and
his
pleasure
is
to
drag
words
this
way
and
that
the
argument
will
prove
to
him
that
he
is
not
making
a
worthy
use
of
his
faculties
for
there
is
no
charm
in
such
puzzles
and
there
is
no
difficulty
in
detecting
them
but
we
can
tell
him
of
something
else
the
pursuit
of
which
is
noble
and
also
difficult
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
a
thing
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
letting
alone
these
puzzles
as
involving
no
difficulty
he
should
be
able
to
follow
and
criticize
in
detail
every
argument
and
when
a
man
says
that
the
same
is
in
a
manner
other
or
that
other
is
the
same
to
understand
and
refute
him
from
his
own
point
of
view
and
in
the
same
respect
in
which
he
asserts
either
of
these
affections
but
to
show
that
somehow
and
in
some
sense
the
same
is
other
or
the
other
same
or
the
great
small
or
the
like
unlike
and
to
delight
in
always
bringing
forward
such
contradictions
is
no
real
refutation
but
is
clearly
the
babe
of
some
one
who
is
only
beginning
to
approach
the
problem
of
being
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
for
certainly
my
friend
the
attempt
to
separate
all
existences
from
one
another
is
a
barbarism
and
utterly
unworthy
of
an
educated
or
philosophical
mind
theaetetus
why
so
stranger
the
attempt
at
universal
separation
is
the
final
annihilation
of
all
reasoning
for
only
by
the
union
of
conceptions
with
one
another
do
we
attain
to
discourse
of
reason
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
observe
that
we
were
only
just
in
time
in
making
a
resistance
to
such
separatists
and
compelling
them
to
admit
that
one
thing
mingles
with
another
theaetetus
why
so
stranger
why
that
we
might
be
able
to
assert
discourse
to
be
a
kind
of
being
for
if
we
could
not
the
worst
of
all
consequences
would
follow
we
should
have
no
philosophy
moreover
the
necessity
for
determining
the
nature
of
discourse
presses
upon
us
at
this
moment
if
utterly
deprived
of
it
we
could
no
more
hold
discourse
and
deprived
of
it
we
should
be
if
we
admitted
that
there
was
no
admixture
of
natures
at
all
theaetetus
very
true
but
i
do
not
understand
why
at
this
moment
we
must
determine
the
nature
of
discourse
stranger
perhaps
you
will
see
more
clearly
by
the
help
of
the
following
explanation
theaetetus
what
explanation
stranger
has
been
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
one
among
many
classes
diffused
over
all
being
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
thence
arises
the
question
whether
mingles
with
opinion
and
language
theaetetus
how
so
stranger
if
has
no
part
in
the
proposition
then
all
things
must
be
true
but
if
has
a
part
then
false
opinion
and
false
speech
are
possible
for
to
think
or
to
say
what
is
not
is
falsehood
which
thus
arises
in
the
region
of
thought
and
in
speech
theaetetus
that
is
quite
true
stranger
and
where
there
is
falsehood
surely
there
must
be
deceit
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
if
there
is
deceit
then
all
things
must
be
full
of
idols
and
images
and
fancies
theaetetus
to
be
sure
stranger
into
that
region
the
sophist
as
we
said
made
his
escape
and
when
he
had
got
there
denied
the
very
possibility
of
falsehood
no
one
he
argued
either
conceived
or
uttered
falsehood
inasmuch
as
did
not
in
any
way
partake
of
being
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
now
has
been
shown
to
partake
of
being
and
therefore
he
will
not
continue
fighting
in
this
direction
but
he
will
probably
say
that
some
ideas
partake
of
and
some
not
and
that
language
and
opinion
are
of
the
class
and
he
will
still
fight
to
the
death
against
the
existence
of
the
and
phantastic
art
in
which
we
have
placed
him
because
as
he
will
say
opinion
and
language
do
not
partake
of
and
unless
this
participation
exists
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
falsehood
and
with
the
view
of
meeting
this
evasion
we
must
begin
by
enquiring
into
the
nature
of
language
opinion
and
imagination
in
order
that
when
we
find
them
we
may
find
also
that
they
have
communion
with
and
having
made
out
the
connexion
of
them
may
thus
prove
that
falsehood
exists
and
therein
we
will
imprison
the
sophist
if
he
deserves
it
or
if
not
we
will
let
him
go
again
and
look
for
him
in
another
class
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
there
appears
to
be
truth
in
what
was
said
about
the
sophist
at
first
that
he
was
of
a
class
not
easily
caught
for
he
seems
to
have
abundance
of
defences
which
he
throws
up
and
which
must
every
one
of
them
be
stormed
before
we
can
reach
the
man
himself
and
even
now
we
have
with
difficulty
got
through
his
first
defence
which
is
the
of
and
lo
here
is
another
for
we
have
still
to
show
that
falsehood
exists
in
the
sphere
of
language
and
opinion
and
there
will
be
another
and
another
line
of
defence
without
end
stranger
any
one
theaetetus
who
is
able
to
advance
even
a
little
ought
to
be
of
good
cheer
for
what
would
he
who
is
dispirited
at
a
little
progress
do
if
he
were
making
none
at
all
or
even
undergoing
a
repulse
such
a
faint
heart
as
the
proverb
says
will
never
take
a
city
but
now
that
we
have
succeeded
thus
far
the
citadel
is
ours
and
what
remains
is
easier
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
then
as
i
was
saying
let
us
first
of
all
obtain
a
conception
of
language
and
opinion
in
order
that
we
may
have
clearer
grounds
for
determining
whether
has
any
concern
with
them
or
whether
they
are
both
always
true
and
neither
of
them
ever
false
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
now
let
us
speak
of
names
as
before
we
were
speaking
of
ideas
and
letters
for
that
is
the
direction
in
which
the
answer
may
be
expected
theaetetus
and
what
is
the
question
at
issue
about
names
stranger
the
question
at
issue
is
whether
all
names
may
be
connected
with
one
another
or
none
or
only
some
of
them
theaetetus
clearly
the
last
is
true
stranger
i
understand
you
to
say
that
words
which
have
a
meaning
when
in
sequence
may
be
connected
but
that
words
which
have
no
meaning
when
in
sequence
can
not
be
connected
theaetetus
what
are
you
saying
stranger
what
i
thought
that
you
intended
when
you
gave
your
assent
for
there
are
two
sorts
of
intimation
of
being
which
are
given
by
the
voice
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
one
of
them
is
called
nouns
and
the
other
verbs
theaetetus
describe
them
stranger
that
which
denotes
action
we
call
a
verb
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
the
other
which
is
an
articulate
mark
set
on
those
who
do
the
actions
we
call
a
noun
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
a
succession
of
nouns
only
is
not
a
sentence
any
more
than
of
verbs
without
nouns
theaetetus
i
do
not
understand
you
stranger
i
see
that
when
you
gave
your
assent
you
had
something
else
in
your
mind
but
what
i
intended
to
say
was
that
a
mere
succession
of
nouns
or
of
verbs
is
not
discourse
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
i
mean
that
words
like
or
any
other
words
which
denote
action
however
many
of
them
you
string
together
do
not
make
discourse
theaetetus
how
can
they
stranger
or
again
when
you
say
or
any
other
words
which
denote
agents
neither
in
this
way
of
stringing
words
together
do
you
attain
to
discourse
for
there
is
no
expression
of
action
or
inaction
or
of
the
existence
of
existence
or
indicated
by
the
sounds
until
verbs
are
mingled
with
nouns
then
the
words
fit
and
the
smallest
combination
of
them
forms
language
and
is
the
simplest
and
least
form
of
discourse
theaetetus
again
i
ask
what
do
you
mean
stranger
when
any
one
says
man
learns
should
you
not
call
this
the
simplest
and
least
of
sentences
theaetetus
yes
stranger
yes
for
he
now
arrives
at
the
point
of
giving
an
intimation
about
something
which
is
or
is
becoming
or
has
become
or
will
be
and
he
not
only
names
but
he
does
something
by
connecting
verbs
with
nouns
and
therefore
we
say
that
he
discourses
and
to
this
connexion
of
words
we
give
the
name
of
discourse
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
as
there
are
some
things
which
fit
one
another
and
other
things
which
do
not
fit
so
there
are
some
vocal
signs
which
do
and
others
which
do
not
combine
and
form
discourse
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
there
is
another
small
matter
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
a
sentence
must
and
can
not
help
having
a
subject
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
must
be
of
a
certain
quality
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
now
let
us
mind
what
we
are
about
theaetetus
we
must
do
so
stranger
i
will
repeat
a
sentence
to
you
in
which
a
thing
and
an
action
are
combined
by
the
help
of
a
noun
and
a
verb
and
you
shall
tell
me
of
whom
the
sentence
speaks
theaetetus
i
will
to
the
best
of
my
power
stranger
sits
not
a
very
long
sentence
theaetetus
not
very
stranger
of
whom
does
the
sentence
speak
and
who
is
the
subject
that
is
what
you
have
to
tell
theaetetus
of
me
i
am
the
subject
stranger
or
this
sentence
again
theaetetus
what
sentence
stranger
with
whom
i
am
now
speaking
is
flying
theaetetus
that
also
is
a
sentence
which
will
be
admitted
by
every
one
to
speak
of
me
and
to
apply
to
me
stranger
we
agreed
that
every
sentence
must
necessarily
have
a
certain
quality
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
what
is
the
quality
of
each
of
these
two
sentences
theaetetus
the
one
as
i
imagine
is
false
and
the
other
true
stranger
the
true
says
what
is
true
about
you
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
the
false
says
what
is
other
than
true
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
therefore
speaks
of
things
which
are
not
as
if
they
were
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
say
that
things
are
real
of
you
which
are
not
for
as
we
were
saying
in
regard
to
each
thing
or
person
there
is
much
that
is
and
much
that
is
not
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
the
second
of
the
two
sentences
which
related
to
you
was
first
of
all
an
example
of
the
shortest
form
consistent
with
our
definition
theaetetus
yes
this
was
implied
in
recent
admission
stranger
and
in
the
second
place
it
related
to
a
subject
theaetetus
yes
stranger
who
must
be
you
and
can
be
nobody
else
theaetetus
unquestionably
stranger
and
it
would
be
no
sentence
at
all
if
there
were
no
subject
for
as
we
proved
a
sentence
which
has
no
subject
is
impossible
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
when
other
then
is
asserted
of
you
as
the
same
and
as
being
such
a
combination
of
nouns
and
verbs
is
really
and
truly
false
discourse
theaetetus
most
true
stranger
and
therefore
thought
opinion
and
imagination
are
now
proved
to
exist
in
our
minds
both
as
true
and
false
theaetetus
how
so
stranger
you
will
know
better
if
you
first
gain
a
knowledge
of
what
they
are
and
in
what
they
severally
differ
from
one
another
theaetetus
give
me
the
knowledge
which
you
would
wish
me
to
gain
stranger
are
not
thought
and
speech
the
same
with
this
exception
that
what
is
called
thought
is
the
unuttered
conversation
of
the
soul
with
herself
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
but
the
stream
of
thought
which
flows
through
the
lips
and
is
audible
is
called
speech
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
we
know
that
there
exists
in
speech
theaetetus
what
exists
stranger
affirmation
theaetetus
yes
we
know
it
stranger
when
the
affirmation
or
denial
takes
place
in
silence
and
in
the
mind
only
have
you
any
other
name
by
which
to
call
it
but
opinion
theaetetus
there
can
be
no
other
name
stranger
and
when
opinion
is
presented
not
simply
but
in
some
form
of
sense
would
you
not
call
it
imagination
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
and
seeing
that
language
is
true
and
false
and
that
thought
is
the
conversation
of
the
soul
with
herself
and
opinion
is
the
end
of
thinking
and
imagination
or
phantasy
is
the
union
of
sense
and
opinion
the
inference
is
that
some
of
them
since
they
are
akin
to
language
should
have
an
element
of
falsehood
as
well
as
of
truth
theaetetus
certainly
stranger
do
you
perceive
then
that
false
opinion
and
speech
have
been
discovered
sooner
than
we
expected
for
just
now
we
seemed
to
be
undertaking
a
task
which
would
never
be
accomplished
theaetetus
i
perceive
stranger
then
let
us
not
be
discouraged
about
the
future
but
now
having
made
this
discovery
let
us
go
back
to
our
previous
classification
theaetetus
what
classification
stranger
we
divided
into
two
sorts
the
one
the
other
imaginative
or
phantastic
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
we
said
that
we
were
uncertain
in
which
we
should
place
the
sophist
theaetetus
we
did
say
so
stranger
and
our
heads
began
to
go
round
more
and
more
when
it
was
asserted
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
image
or
idol
or
appearance
because
in
no
manner
or
time
or
place
can
there
ever
be
such
a
thing
as
falsehood
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
now
since
there
has
been
shown
to
be
false
speech
and
false
opinion
there
may
be
imitations
of
real
existences
and
out
of
this
condition
of
the
mind
an
art
of
deception
may
arise
theaetetus
quite
possible
stranger
and
we
have
already
admitted
in
what
preceded
that
the
sophist
was
lurking
in
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
art
theaetetus
yes
stranger
let
us
then
renew
the
attempt
and
in
dividing
any
class
always
take
the
part
to
the
right
holding
fast
to
that
which
holds
the
sophist
until
we
have
stripped
him
of
all
his
common
properties
and
reached
his
difference
or
peculiar
then
we
may
exhibit
him
in
his
true
nature
first
to
ourselves
and
then
to
kindred
dialectical
spirits
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
you
may
remember
that
all
art
was
originally
divided
by
us
into
creative
and
acquisitive
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
the
sophist
was
flitting
before
us
in
the
acquisitive
class
in
the
subdivisions
of
hunting
contests
merchandize
and
the
like
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
but
now
that
the
imitative
art
has
enclosed
him
it
is
clear
that
we
must
begin
by
dividing
the
art
of
creation
for
imitation
is
a
kind
of
creation
of
images
however
as
we
affirm
and
not
of
real
things
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
in
the
first
place
there
are
two
kinds
of
creation
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
one
of
them
is
human
and
the
other
divine
theaetetus
i
do
not
follow
stranger
every
power
as
you
may
remember
our
saying
originally
which
causes
things
to
exist
not
previously
existing
was
defined
by
us
as
creative
theaetetus
i
remember
stranger
looking
now
at
the
world
and
all
the
animals
and
plants
at
things
which
grow
upon
the
earth
from
seeds
and
roots
as
well
as
at
inanimate
substances
which
are
formed
within
the
earth
fusile
or
shall
we
say
that
they
come
into
existence
not
having
existed
previously
by
the
creation
of
god
or
shall
we
agree
with
vulgar
opinion
about
them
theaetetus
what
is
it
stranger
the
opinion
that
nature
brings
them
into
being
from
some
spontaneous
and
unintelligent
cause
or
shall
we
say
that
they
are
created
by
a
divine
reason
and
a
knowledge
which
comes
from
god
theaetetus
i
dare
say
that
owing
to
my
youth
i
may
often
waver
in
my
view
but
now
when
i
look
at
you
and
see
that
you
incline
to
refer
them
to
god
i
defer
to
your
authority
stranger
nobly
said
theaetetus
and
if
i
thought
that
you
were
one
of
those
who
would
hereafter
change
your
mind
i
would
have
gently
argued
with
you
and
forced
you
to
assent
but
as
i
perceive
that
you
will
come
of
yourself
and
without
any
argument
of
mine
to
that
belief
which
as
you
say
attracts
you
i
will
not
forestall
the
work
of
time
let
me
suppose
then
that
things
which
are
said
to
be
made
by
nature
are
the
work
of
divine
art
and
that
things
which
are
made
by
man
out
of
these
are
works
of
human
art
and
so
there
are
two
kinds
of
making
and
production
the
one
human
and
the
other
divine
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
now
subdivide
each
of
the
two
sections
which
we
have
already
theaetetus
how
do
you
mean
stranger
i
mean
to
say
that
you
should
make
a
vertical
division
of
production
or
invention
as
you
have
already
made
a
lateral
one
theaetetus
i
have
done
so
stranger
then
now
there
are
in
all
four
parts
or
segments
two
of
them
have
reference
to
us
and
are
human
and
two
of
them
have
reference
to
the
gods
and
are
divine
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
again
in
the
division
which
was
supposed
to
be
made
in
the
other
way
one
part
in
each
subdivision
is
the
making
of
the
things
themselves
but
the
two
remaining
parts
may
be
called
the
making
of
likenesses
and
so
the
productive
art
is
again
divided
into
two
parts
theaetetus
tell
me
the
divisions
once
more
stranger
i
suppose
that
we
and
the
other
animals
and
the
elements
out
of
which
things
are
made
fire
water
and
the
like
are
known
by
us
to
be
each
and
all
the
creation
and
work
of
god
theaetetus
true
stranger
and
there
are
images
of
them
which
are
not
them
but
which
correspond
to
them
and
these
are
also
the
creation
of
a
wonderful
skill
theaetetus
what
are
they
stranger
the
appearances
which
spring
up
of
themselves
in
sleep
or
by
day
such
as
a
shadow
when
darkness
arises
in
a
fire
or
the
reflection
which
is
produced
when
the
light
in
bright
and
smooth
objects
meets
on
their
surface
with
an
external
light
and
creates
a
perception
the
opposite
of
our
ordinary
sight
theaetetus
yes
and
the
images
as
well
as
the
creation
are
equally
the
work
of
a
divine
hand
stranger
and
what
shall
we
say
of
human
art
do
we
not
make
one
house
by
the
art
of
building
and
another
by
the
art
of
drawing
which
is
a
sort
of
dream
created
by
man
for
those
who
are
awake
theaetetus
quite
true
stranger
and
other
products
of
human
creation
are
also
twofold
and
go
in
pairs
there
is
the
thing
with
which
the
art
of
making
the
thing
is
concerned
and
the
image
with
which
imitation
is
concerned
theaetetus
now
i
begin
to
understand
and
am
ready
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
production
and
each
of
them
twofold
in
the
lateral
division
there
is
both
a
divine
and
a
human
production
in
the
vertical
there
are
realities
and
a
creation
of
a
kind
of
similitudes
stranger
and
let
us
not
forget
that
of
the
imitative
class
the
one
part
was
to
have
been
and
the
other
phantastic
if
it
could
be
shown
that
falsehood
is
a
reality
and
belongs
to
the
class
of
real
being
theaetetus
yes
stranger
and
this
appeared
to
be
the
case
and
therefore
now
without
hesitation
we
shall
number
the
different
kinds
as
two
theaetetus
true
stranger
then
now
let
us
again
divide
the
phantastic
art
theaetetus
where
shall
we
make
the
division
stranger
there
is
one
kind
which
is
produced
by
an
instrument
and
another
in
which
the
creator
of
the
appearance
is
himself
the
instrument
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
stranger
when
any
one
makes
himself
appear
like
another
in
his
figure
or
his
voice
imitation
is
the
name
for
this
part
of
the
phantastic
art
theaetetus
yes
stranger
let
this
then
be
named
the
art
of
mimicry
and
this
the
province
assigned
to
it
as
for
the
other
division
we
are
weary
and
will
give
that
up
leaving
to
some
one
else
the
duty
of
making
the
class
and
giving
it
a
suitable
name
theaetetus
let
us
do
as
you
say
assign
a
sphere
to
the
one
and
leave
the
other
stranger
there
is
a
further
distinction
theaetetus
which
is
worthy
of
our
consideration
and
for
a
reason
which
i
will
tell
you
theaetetus
let
me
hear
stranger
there
are
some
who
imitate
knowing
what
they
imitate
and
some
who
do
not
know
and
what
line
of
distinction
can
there
possibly
be
greater
than
that
which
divides
ignorance
from
knowledge
theaetetus
there
can
be
no
greater
stranger
was
not
the
sort
of
imitation
of
which
we
spoke
just
now
the
imitation
of
those
who
know
for
he
who
would
imitate
you
would
surely
know
you
and
your
figure
theaetetus
naturally
stranger
and
what
would
you
say
of
the
figure
or
form
of
justice
or
of
virtue
in
general
are
we
not
well
aware
that
many
having
no
knowledge
of
either
but
only
a
sort
of
opinion
do
their
best
to
show
that
this
opinion
is
really
entertained
by
them
by
expressing
it
as
far
as
they
can
in
word
and
deed
theaetetus
yes
that
is
very
common
stranger
and
do
they
always
fail
in
their
attempt
to
be
thought
just
when
they
are
not
or
is
not
the
very
opposite
true
theaetetus
the
very
opposite
stranger
such
a
one
then
should
be
described
as
an
imitator
to
be
distinguished
from
the
other
as
he
who
is
ignorant
is
distinguished
from
him
who
knows
theaetetus
true
stranger
can
we
find
a
suitable
name
for
each
of
them
this
is
clearly
not
an
easy
task
for
among
the
ancients
there
was
some
confusion
of
ideas
which
prevented
them
from
attempting
to
divide
genera
into
species
wherefore
there
is
no
great
abundance
of
names
yet
for
the
sake
of
distinctness
i
will
make
bold
to
call
the
imitation
which
coexists
with
opinion
the
imitation
of
appearance
that
which
coexists
with
science
a
scientific
or
learned
imitation
theaetetus
granted
stranger
the
former
is
our
present
concern
for
the
sophist
was
classed
with
imitators
indeed
but
not
among
those
who
have
knowledge
theaetetus
very
true
stranger
let
us
then
examine
our
imitator
of
appearance
and
see
whether
he
is
sound
like
a
piece
of
iron
or
whether
there
is
still
some
crack
in
him
theaetetus
let
us
examine
him
stranger
indeed
there
is
a
very
considerable
crack
for
if
you
look
you
find
that
one
of
the
two
classes
of
imitators
is
a
simple
creature
who
thinks
that
he
knows
that
which
he
only
fancies
the
other
sort
has
knocked
about
among
arguments
until
he
suspects
and
fears
that
he
is
ignorant
of
that
which
to
the
many
he
pretends
to
know
theaetetus
there
are
certainly
the
two
kinds
which
you
describe
stranger
shall
we
regard
one
as
the
simple
imitator
the
other
as
the
dissembling
or
ironical
imitator
theaetetus
very
good
stranger
and
shall
we
further
speak
of
this
latter
class
as
having
one
or
two
divisions
theaetetus
answer
yourself
stranger
upon
consideration
then
there
appear
to
me
to
be
two
there
is
the
dissembler
who
harangues
a
multitude
in
public
in
a
long
speech
and
the
dissembler
who
in
private
and
in
short
speeches
compels
the
person
who
is
conversing
with
him
to
contradict
himself
theaetetus
what
you
say
is
most
true
stranger
and
who
is
the
maker
of
the
longer
speeches
is
he
the
statesman
or
the
popular
orator
theaetetus
the
latter
stranger
and
what
shall
we
call
the
other
is
he
the
philosopher
or
the
sophist
theaetetus
the
philosopher
he
can
not
be
for
upon
our
view
he
is
ignorant
but
since
he
is
an
imitator
of
the
wise
he
will
have
a
name
which
is
formed
by
an
adaptation
of
the
word
sophos
what
shall
we
name
him
i
am
pretty
sure
that
i
can
not
be
mistaken
in
terming
him
the
true
and
very
sophist
stranger
shall
we
bind
up
his
name
as
we
did
before
making
a
chain
from
one
end
of
his
genealogy
to
the
other
theaetetus
by
all
means
stranger
he
then
who
traces
the
pedigree
of
his
art
as
follows
who
belonging
to
the
conscious
or
dissembling
section
of
the
art
of
causing
is
an
imitator
of
appearance
and
is
separated
from
the
class
of
phantastic
which
is
a
branch
of
into
that
further
division
of
creation
the
juggling
of
words
a
creation
human
and
not
divine
any
one
who
affirms
the
real
sophist
to
be
of
this
blood
and
lineage
will
say
the
very
truth
theaetetus
undoubtedly
