a
pious
and
learned
minister
of
camenz
in
the
oberlausitz
who
had
two
daughters
also
as
a
child
lessing
delighted
in
books
and
had
knowledge
beyond
his
years
when
he
went
to
school
in
meissen
at
the
age
of
twelve
as
a
he
read
much
greek
and
latin
that
formed
no
part
of
the
school
course
read
also
the
german
poets
of
his
time
wrote
a
history
of
ancient
mathematics
and
began
a
poem
of
his
own
on
the
plurality
of
in
at
the
age
of
seventeen
lessing
was
sent
to
the
university
of
leipsic
there
he
studied
with
energy
and
was
attracted
strongly
by
the
theatre
his
artistic
interest
in
the
drama
caused
him
to
be
put
on
the
free
list
of
the
theatre
in
exchange
for
some
translations
of
french
pieces
then
he
produced
also
for
the
leipsic
stage
many
slight
pieces
of
his
own
and
he
had
serious
thought
of
turning
actor
which
excited
alarm
in
the
parsonage
at
camenz
and
caused
his
recall
home
in
january
it
was
found
however
that
although
he
could
not
be
trained
to
follow
his
father
s
profession
he
had
been
studying
to
such
good
purpose
and
developing
in
purity
of
life
such
worth
of
character
that
after
easter
he
was
sent
back
to
leipsic
with
leave
to
transfer
his
studies
from
theology
to
medicine
lessing
went
back
continued
to
work
hard
but
still
also
gave
all
his
leisure
to
the
players
for
the
debts
of
some
of
them
he
had
incautiously
become
surety
and
when
the
company
removed
to
vienna
there
were
left
behind
them
unpaid
debts
for
which
young
lessing
was
answerable
the
creditors
pressed
and
lessing
moved
to
wittenberg
but
he
fell
ill
and
was
made
so
miserable
by
pressure
for
impossible
payments
that
he
resolved
to
break
off
his
studies
go
to
berlin
and
begin
earning
by
his
pen
his
first
earnings
being
for
the
satisfaction
of
these
leipsic
creditors
lessing
went
first
to
berlin
to
seek
his
fortune
in
december
when
he
was
nineteen
years
old
he
was
without
money
without
decent
clothes
and
with
but
one
friend
in
berlin
mylius
who
was
then
editing
a
small
journal
the
much
correspondence
brought
him
a
little
money
from
the
overburdened
home
and
with
addition
of
some
small
earning
from
translations
this
enabled
him
to
obtain
a
suit
of
clothes
in
which
he
might
venture
to
present
himself
to
strangers
in
his
search
for
fortune
a
new
venture
with
mylius
a
quarterly
record
of
the
history
of
the
theatre
was
not
successful
but
having
charge
committed
to
him
of
the
library
part
of
mylius
s
journal
lessing
had
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
great
critical
power
gottsched
at
leipsic
was
then
leader
of
the
war
on
behalf
of
classicism
in
german
literature
lessing
fought
on
the
national
side
and
opposed
also
the
beginning
of
a
new
french
influence
then
rising
which
was
to
have
its
chief
apostle
in
rousseau
in
lessing
went
back
to
wittenberg
for
another
year
that
he
might
complete
the
work
for
graduation
graduated
in
december
of
that
year
as
master
of
arts
and
then
returned
to
his
work
in
berlin

worked
industriously
not
only
as
critic
but
also
in
translation
from
the
classics
from
french
english
and
italian
and
he
was
soon
able
to
send
help
towards
providing
education
for
the
youngest
of
the
household
of
twelve
children
in
the
camenz
parsonage
in
he
gave
himself
eight
weeks
of
withdrawal
from
other
work
to
write
in
a
at
potsdam
his
tragedy
of
miss
sarah
it
was
produced
with
great
success
at
frankfort
on
the
oder
and
lessing
s
ruling
passion
for
dramatic
literature
became
the
stronger
for
this
first
experience
of
what
he
might
be
able
to
achieve
in
literature
frederick
the
great
cared
only
for
what
was
french
a
national
drama
therefore
could
not
live
in
berlin
in
the
autumn
of
lessing
suddenly
moved
to
leipsic
where
an
actor
whom
he
had
befriended
was
establishing
a
theatre
here
he
was
again
abandoning
himself
to
the
cause
of
a
national
drama
when
a
rich
young
gentleman
of
leipsic
invited
his
companionship
upon
a
tour
in
europe
terms
were
settled
and
they
set
out
together

saw
much
of

attack
on
saxony
recalled
the
young

caused
breach
of
what
had
been
a

wrote
a
tragedy
philotas
and
began
a

especially
employed
his
critical
power
in
letters
upon
the
latest
literature
known
as
his
dissertations
upon
fable
led
also
to
lessing
s
fables
produced
in
this
period
of
his
life
in
lessing
was
tempted
by
scarcity
of
income
to
serve
as
a
government
secretary
at
breslau
he
held
that
office
for
five
years
and
then
again
returned
to
his
old
work
in
berlin

the
five
years

greatest
of
his
critical
works

a
treatise
on
the
boundary
lines
of
painting
and
all
that
he
might
then
have
saved
from
his
earnings
went
to
the
buying
of
books
and
to
the
relief
of
the
burdens
in
the
camenz
parsonage
at
berlin
the
office
of
royal
librarian
became
vacant
the
claims
of
lessing
were
urged
but
frederick
appointed
an
insignificant
frenchman
in
lessing
was
called
to
aid
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
establish
a
national
theatre
in
hamburg
other
troubles
followed
lessing
gave
his
heart
to
a
widow
eva
könig
and
was
betrothed
to
her
but
the
involvements
of
her
worldly
affairs
and
of
his
delayed
the
marriage
for
six
years
to
secure
fixed
income
he
took
a
poor
office
as
librarian
at
wolfenbüttel
in
his
first
year
at
wolfenbüttel
he
wrote
his
play
of
emilia
then
came
a
journey
to
italy
but
it
came
in
inconvenient
form
for
it
had
to
be
made
with
prince
leopold
of
brunswick
hurriedly
for
the
sake
of
money
at
the
time
when
lessing
was
at
last
able
to
marry
the
wife
long
waited
for
and
deeply
loved

at
the
birth
of
her
first
child
this
was
in
january
when
lessing
s
age
was
very
soon
afterwards
he
was
attacked
by
a
pastor
goeze
in
hamburg
and
other
narrow
theologians
for
having
edited
papers
that
contained
an
attack
on
christianity
which
lessing
himself
had
said
that
he
wished
to
see
answered
before
he
died
the
uncharitable
bitterness
of
these
attacks
felt
by
a
mind
that
had
been
touched
to
the
quick
by
the
deepest
of
sorrows
helped
to
the
shaping
of
lessing
s
calm
beautiful
lesson
of
charity
this
noblest
of
his
nathan
the
but
lessing
s
health
was
shattered
and
he
survived
his
wife
only
three
years
he
died
in
leaving
imperishable
influence
for
good
upon
the
minds
of
men
but
so
poor
in
what
the
world
calls
wealth
that
his
funeral
had
to
be
paid
for
by
a
duke
of
brunswick

born
in
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
at
norwich
from
whose
business
he
was
drawn
away
by
his
strong
bent
towards
literature
his
father
yielded
to
his
wishes
after
long
visits
to
france
and
to
germany
in
days
astir
with
the
new
movements
of
thought
that
preceded
and
followed
the
french
revolution
he
formed
a
close
friendship
with
southey
edited
for
a
little
time
a
norwich
iris
and
in
his
later
years
became
known
especially
for
his
historic
survey
of
german
poetry
which
included
his
translations
and
among
them
this
of
nathan
the
it
was
published
in
taylor

in
thomas
carlyle
in
reviewing
william
taylor
s
survey
of
german
poetry
said
of
the
author
s
own
translations
in
it
compared
with
the
average
of
british
translations
they
may
be
pronounced
of
almost
ideal
excellence
compared
with
the
best
translations
extant
for
example
the
german
shakespeare
homer
calderon
they
may
still
be
called
better
than
indifferent
one
great
merit
taylor

rigorous
adherence
to
his
original

came
he
went
we
know
not
whence
or
whither
quite
unacquainted
with
the
house
unguided
but
by
his
ear
he
prest
through
smoke
and
flame
his
mantle
spread
before
him
to
the
room
whence
pierced
the
shrieks
for
help
and
we
began
to
think
him
her
when
all
at
once
bursting
from
flame
and
smoke
he
stood
before
us
she
in
his
arm
upheld
cold
and
unmoved
by
our
loud
warmth
of
thanks
he
left
his
booty
struggled
into
the
crowd
and
disappeared
nathan
but
not
for
ever
daya
i
would
hope
daya
for
some
days
after
underneath
you
palms
that
shade
his
grave
who
rose
again
from
death
we
saw
him
wandering
up
and
down
i
went
with
transport
went
to
thank
him
i
conjured
intreated
him
to
visit
once
again
the
dear
sweet
girl
he
saved
who
longed
to
shed
at
her
preserver
s
feet
the
grateful
nathan
well
daya
but
in
vain
deaf
to
our
warmest
prayers
on
me
he
flung
such
bitter
nathan
that
hence
daya
oh
no
oh
no
indeed
not
daily
i
forced
myself
upon
him
daily
afresh
encountered
his
dry
taunting
speeches
much
i
have
borne
and
would
have
borne
much
more
but
he
of
late
forbears
his
lonely
walk
under
the
scattered
palms
which
stand
about
our
holy
sepulchre
nor
have
i
learnt
where
he
now
is
you
seem
nathan
i
was
imagining
what
strange
impressions
this
conduct
makes
on
such
a
mind
as
recha
s
disdained
by
one
whom
she
must
feel
compelled
to
venerate
and
to
esteem
so
highly
at
once
attracted
and
combat
between
her
head
and
heart
must
yet
endure
regret
resentment
in
unusual
struggle
neither
perhaps
obtains
the
upper
hand
and
busy
fancy
meddling
in
the
fray
weaves
wild
enthusiasms
to
her
dazzled
spirit
now
clothing
passion
in
the
garb
of
reason
and
reason
now
in
passion
i
err
this
last
is
recha
s
daya
aye
but
such
pious
lovely
sweet
illusions
nathan
illusions
though
daya
yes
and
the
one
her
bosom
clings
to
most
fondly
is
that
the
brave
templar
was
but
a
transient
inmate
of
the
earth
a
guardian
angel
such
as
from
her
childhood
she
loved
to
fancy
kindly
hovering
round
her
who
from
his
veiling
cloud
amid
the
fire
stepped
forth
in
her
preserver
s
form
you
who
knows
at
least
beware
of
banishing
so
pleasing
an
deceitful
christian
jew
mussulman
agree
to
own
it
and
least
to
dear
illusion
nathan
also
to
me
go

good
daya

see
what
she

after

her
then

ll
find
out
our
untamed
guardian
angel
bring
him
to
sojourn
here
awhile
among
we
ll
pinion
his
wild
wing
when
once
he
s
taken
daya
you
undertake
too
much
nathan
and
when
my
daya
this
sweet
illusion
yields
to
sweeter
truth
for
to
a
man
a
man
is
ever
dearer
than
any
angel
you
must
not
be
angry
to
see
our
loved
enthusiast
exercised

where
are
you
then
what
mountains
deserts
torrents
divide
us
now
you
see
me
face
to
face
and
do
not
hasten
to
embrace
your
recha
poor
recha
she
was
almost
burnt
alive
but
do
not
shudder
o
tis
a
horrid
end
to
die
in
fire
nathan
my
child
my
darling
child
recha
you
had
to
cross
the
jordan
tigris
and
euphrates
and
who
knows
what
rivers
else
i
used
to
tremble
and
quake
for
you
till
the
fire
came
so
nigh
me
since
then
methinks
twere
comfort
balm
refreshment
to
die
by
water
but
you
are
not
i
am
not
burnt
will
we
will
praise
kind
good
god
who
bore
thee
upon
the
buoyant
wings
of
angels
across
the
treacherous
god
who
bade
my
angel
on
his
white
wing
athwart
the
roaring
nathan
white
wing
aye
the
broad
white
fluttering
mantle
of
the
templar
recha
yes
visibly
he
bore
me
through
the
fire
o
ershadowed
by
his
to
face
i
ve
seen
an
angel
father
my
own
angel
nathan
recha
deserves
it
and
would
see
in
him
no
fairer
form
than
he
beheld
in
her
recha
whom
are
you
flattering
me
the
angel
or
yourself
nathan
yet
had
a
man
a
man
of
those
whom
nature
daily
fashions
done
you
this
service
he
to
you
had
seemed
had
been
an
angel
recha
no
not
such
a
one
indeed
it
was
a
true
and
real
angel
and
have
not
you
yourself
instructed
me
how
possible
it
is
there
may
be
angels
that
god
for
those
who
love
him
can
work
and
i
do
love
him
nathan
and
he
thee
and
both
for
thee
and
all
like
thee
my
child
works
daily
wonders
from
eternity
has
wrought
them
for
you
recha
that
i
like
to
hear
nathan
well
and
although
it
sounds
quite
natural
an
every
day
event
a
simple
story
that
you
was
by
a
real
templar
saved
is
it
the
less
a
miracle
the
greatest
of
all
is
this
that
true
and
real
wonders
should
happen
so
perpetually
so
daily
without
this
universal
miracle
a
thinking
man
had
scarcely
called
those
such
which
only
children
recha
ought
to
name
so
who
love
to
gape
and
stare
at
the
unusual
and
hunt
for
daya
why
will
you
then
with
such
vain
subtleties
confuse
her
brain
already
overheated
nathan
let
me
and
is
it
not
enough
then
for
my
recha
to
owe
her
preservation
to
a
man
whom
no
small
miracle
preserved
himself
for
whoe
er
heard
before
that
saladin
let
go
a
templar
that
a
templar
wished
it
hoped
it
or
for
his
ransom
offered
more
than
taunts
his
leathern
or
his
dagger
recha
that
makes
for
me
these
are
so
many
reasons
he
was
no
real
knight
but
only
seemed
it
if
in
jerusalem
no
captive
templar
appears
alive
or
freely
wanders
round
how
could
i
find
one
in
the
night
to
save
me
nathan
ingenious
dextrous
daya
come
in
aid
it
was
from
you
i
learnt
he
was
a
prisoner
doubtless
you
know
still
more
about
him
speak
daya
tis
but
report
indeed
but
it
is
said
that
saladin
bestowed
upon
this
youth
his
gracious
pardon
for
the
strong
resemblance
he
bore
a
favourite
i
think
these
twenty
name
i
know
it
he
fell
i
don
t
know
all
the
story
sounds
so
incredible
that
very
likely
the
whole
is
mere
invention
talk
romance
nathan
and
why
incredible
would
you
reject
this
story
tho
indeed
it
s
often
done
to
fix
on
something
more
incredible
and
give
that
faith
why
should
not
saladin
who
loves
so
singularly
all
his
kindred
have
loved
in
early
youth
with
warmer
fondness
a
brother
now
no
more
do
we
not
see
faces
alike
and
is
an
old
impression
therefore
a
lost
one
do
resembling
features
not
call
up
like
emotions
where
s
th
incredible
surely
sage
daya
this
can
be
to
thee
no
miracle
or
do
wonders
only
should
have
said
belief
daya
you
re
on
the
bite
nathan
were
you
quite
fair
with
me
yet
even
so
my
recha
thy
escape
remains
a
wonder
only
possible
to
him
who
of
the
proud
pursuits
of
princes
makes
if
not

delights
to
head
and
manage
them
by
slender
threads
recha
if
i
do
err
it
is
not

my

nathan
no
you
have
been
always
docile
see
now
a

vaulted

a

bow

rather
than
with
straiter

with

i

of

ask
ye

after

but
nathan
where
s
the
harm
if
i
may
speak
of
fancying
one

saved
rather

methinks
it
brings

just

it

attend

to

you

and
thou
especially
wouldst
gladly
show

in

what

at

it

your

much
more

to

had
furnished

with

be
made
out
of

yes
surely
but
i
have
been

to
think
a

a
thorough
dervis
will
allow
nothing
to
be
made
of
him
hafi
tis
true
that
i
m
no
thorough
dervis
but
by
the
prophet
when
we
nathan
must
hafi
needs
to
no
man
and
a
hafi
when
he
is
much
besought
and
thinks
it
right
a

nathan
well
spoken
by
our

embrace

man
you
re

why
not
ask
first
what
has
been
made
of

nathan
ask
climbers
to
look
back
hafi

may
i
not
have
grown
to
such
a

in
the

that
my

is
no

welcome
nathan
if
you
still
bear
your

run
the
risk
of
that

your

a

what

it
bring

not

thee
it

unlock

make

take

nathan
till

acting

these
have
metamorphosed

sillier
weakness

flattered

all
a

wants
are
only
known
to
a

such
alone
can
tell
how
to
relieve
them
usefully
and
wisely
thy

was
too
cold
for
me

said

when

unkindly
informed
himself
with
too
precautious
strictness
concerning
the
receiver
not

bounty
thou
wilt
not
thus
bestow
so

sent
to
follow
you
for
templar
sent
then
friar
yes
from
the
monastery
templar
where
i
was
just
now
in
hopes
of
coming
in
for
pilgrims
fare
friar
they
were
already
at
table
but
if
it
suit
with
you
to
turn
templar
why
so
tis
true
i
have
not
tasted
meat
this
long
time
what
of
that
the
dates
are
ripe
friar
o
with
that
fruit
go
cautiously
to
work
too
much
of
it
is
hurtful
sours
the
humours
makes
the
blood
melancholy
templar
and
if
i
choose
to
be
this
warning
you
were
not
sent
to
follow
me
i
ween
friar
oh
no
i
only
was
to
ask
about
you
and
feel
your
pulse
a
little
templar
and
you
tell
me
of
that
yourself
friar
why
not
templar
a
deep
one
troth
and
has
your
cloister
more
such
friar
i
can
t
say
obedience
is
our
bounden
duty
templar
and
you
obey
without
much
scrupulous
questioning
friar
were
it
obedience
else
good
sir
templar
how
is
it
the
simple
mind
is
ever
in
the
right
may
you
inform
me
who
it
is
that
wishes
to
know
more
of
me
tis
not
you
yourself
i
dare
be
sworn
friar
would
it
become
me
sir
or
benefit
me
templar
whom
can
it
become
whom
can
it
benefit
to
be
so
curious
friar
the
patriarch
i
twas
he
that
sent
me
templar
the
patriarch
knows
he
not
my
badge
the
cross
of
red
on
the
white
mantle
friar
can
i
say
templar
well
brother
well
i
am
a
templar
taken
prisoner
at
tebnin
whose
exalted
fortress
just
as
the
truce
expired
we
sought
to
climb
in
order
to
push
forward
next
to
sidon
i
was
the
twentieth
captive
but
the
only
pardoned
by
this
the
patriarch
knows
all
or
more
than
his
occasions
ask
friar
and
yet
no
more
than
he
already
knows
i
think
but
why
alone
of
all
the
captives
thou
hast
been
spared
he
fain
would
templar
can
i
myself
tell
that
already
with
bare
neck
i
kneeled
upon
my
mantle
and
awaited
the
saladin
with
steadfast
eye
fixed
me
sprang
nearer
to
me
made
a
i
was
upraised
unbound
about
to
thank
and
saw
his
eye
in
tears
both
stand
in
silence
he
goes
i
stay
how
all
this
hangs
together
thy
patriarch
may
unriddle
friar
he
concludes
that
god
preserved
you
for
some
mighty
deed
templar
some
mighty
deed
to
save
out
of
the
fire
a
jewish
usher
curious
pilgrims
about
mount
friar
the
time
may
and
this
is
no
such
perhaps
the
patriarch
meditates
a
weightier
office
templar
think
you
so
brother
has
he
hinted
aught
friar
why
yes
i
was
to
sift
you
out
a
little
and
hear
if
you
were
one
templar
what
i
m
curious
to
observe
how
this
man
sifts
friar
the
shortest
way
will
be
to
tell
you
plainly
what
are
the
patriarch
s
wishes
templar
and
they
friar
to
send
a
letter
by
your
hand
templar
by
me
i
am
no
carrier
and
were
that
an
office
more
meritorious
than
to
save
from
burning
a
jewish
maid
friar
so
it
should
seem
must
for
says
the
patriarch
to
all
christendom
this
letter
is
of
import
and
to
bear
it
safe
to
its
destination
says
the
patriarch
god
will
reward
with
a
peculiar
crown
in
heaven
and
of
this
crown
the
patriarch
says
no
one
is
worthier
than
templar
than
i
friar
for
none
so
able
and
so
fit
to
earn
this
crown
the
patriarch
says
as
you
templar
as
i
friar
the
patriarch
here
is
free
can
look
about
him
and
knows
he
says
how
cities
may
be
stormed
and
how
defended
knows
he
says
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
saladin
s
new
bulwark
and
of
the
inner
rampart
last
thrown
up
and
to
the
warriors
of
the
lord
he
says
could
clearly
point
them
out
templar
and
can
i
know
exactly
the
contents
of
this
same
letter
friar
why
that
i
don
t
pretend
to
vouch
tis
to
king
philip
and
our
i
often
wonder
how
this
holy
man
who
lives
so
wholly
to
his
god
and
heaven
can
stoop
to
be
so
well
informed
about
whatever
passes
tis
a
hard
task
templar
your
friar
knows
with
great
precision
and
from
sure
hands
how
when
and
with
what
force
and
in
which
quarter
saladin
in
case
the
war
breaks
out
afresh
will
take
the
field
templar
he
knows
that
friar
yes
and
would
acquaint
king
philip
that
he
may
better
calculate
if
really
the
danger
be
so
great
as
to
require
him
to
renew
at
all
events
the
truce
so
bravely
broken
by
your
body
templar
so
this
is
a
patriarch
indeed
he
wants
no
common
messenger
he
wants
a
spy
go
tell
your
patriarch
brother
i
am
not
as
far
as
you
can
sift
the
man
to
suit
him
i
still
esteem
myself
a
prisoner
and
a
templar
s
only
calling
is
to
fight
and
not
to
ferret
out
intelligence
friar
that
s
much
as
i
supposed
and
to
speak
plainly
not
to
be
blamed
the
best
is
yet
behind
the
patriarch
has
made
out
the
very
fortress
its
name
and
strength
and
site
on
libanon
wherein
the
mighty
sums
are
now
concealed
with
which
the
prudent
father
of
the
sultan
provides
the
cost
of
war
and
pays
the
army
he
knows
that
saladin
from
time
to
time
goes
to
this
fortress
through
and
passe
with
few
attendants
templar
friar
how
easy
twere
to
seize
his
person
in
these
expeditions
and
make
an
end
of
all
you
shudder
two
maronites
who
fear
the
lord
have
offer
to
share
the
danger
of
the
enterprise
under
a
proper
leader
templar
and
the
patriarch
had
cast
his
eye
on
me
for
this
brave
office
friar
he
thinks
king
philip
might
from
ptolemais
best
second
such
a
deed
templar
on
me
on
me
have
you
not
heard
then
just
now
heard
the
favour
which
i
received
from
saladin
friar
oh
yes
templar
and
yet
friar
the
patriarch
s
mighty
god
and
the
order
s
templar
alter
nothing
command
no
villainies
friar
no
that
indeed
not
but
what
is
villainy
in
human
eyes
may
in
the
sight
of
god
the
patriarch
thinks
not
templar
i
owe
my
life
to
saladin
and
might
take
his
friar
but
saladin
the
patriarch
thinks
is
yet
the
common
foe
of
christendom
and
can
not
earn
a
right
to
be
your
friend
templar
my
i
will
not
behave
like
an
ungrateful
scoundrel
to
him
friar
yet
gratitude
the
patriarch
thinks
is
not
a
debt
before
the
eye
of
god
or
man
unless
for
our
own
sakes
the
benefit
had
been
conferred
and
it
has
been
reported
the
patriarch
understands
that
saladin
preserved
your
life
merely
because
your
voice
your
air
or
features
raised
a
recollection
of
his
lost
brother
templar
he
knows
this
and
if
it
were
sure
i
saladin
how
and
shall
nature
then
have
formed
in
me
a
single
feature
in
thy
brother
s
likeness
with
nothing
in
my
soul
to
answer
to
it
or
what
does
correspond
shall
i
suppress
to
please
a
patriarch
so
thou
dost
not
cheat
us
so
not
contradict
thyself
kind
god
of
brother
go
away
do
not
stir
up
my
anger
friar
i
withdraw
more
gladly
than
i
came
we
are
forced
to
vow
obedience
to
superiors
templar
daya
daya
the
monk
methinks
left
him
in
no
good
mood
but
i
must
risk
my
message
templar
better
still
the
proverb
says
that
monks
and
women
are
the
devil
s
clutches
and
i
m
tossed
from
one
to
th
other
daya
whom
do
i
behold
thank
god
i
see
you
noble
knight
once
more
where
have
you
lurked
this
long
long
space
you
ve
not
been
ill
templar
no
daya
well
then
templar
yes
daya
we
ve
all
been
anxious
lest
something
ailed
you

been
journeying

how
long
returned

recha
s
father
too
is
just
returned
and
now
may
recha
hope
at
templar
for
what
daya
for
what
she
often
has
requested
of
you
her
father
pressingly
invites
your
visit
he
now
arrives
from
babylon
with
twenty
camels
brings
the
curious
drugs
and
precious
stones
and
stuffs
he
has
collected
from
syria
persia
india
even
china
templar
i
am
no
chap
daya
his
nation
honours
him
as
if
he
were
a
prince
and
yet
to
hear
him
called
the
nathan
by
them
not
the
has
often
made
me
wonder
templar
to
his
nation
are
and
perhaps
of
equal
import
daya
but
above
all
he
should
be
called
the
you
can
t
imagine
how
much
goodness
dwells
within
him
since
he
has
been
told
the
service
you
rendered
to
his
recha
there
is
nothing
that
he
would
grudge
you
templar
aye
daya
him
try
him
templar
a
burst
of
feeling
soon
is
at
an
end

he
less
kind
less
bountiful
had
housed
with

cradle
said
or
sung

a
noble
page
in

by
birth
a
switzer

obtained
the
gracious
honour
of

remember
should
the

questions

wherefore
so
absent

well
for

back
that
move
saladin
why

knight
becomes
exposed
saladin
tis
true
then
so
sittah
and
so
i
take
the

true
again
then
check
sittah
that
can
not
help
you
when
my
king
is
castled
all

out
of
my
dilemma

unhurt
well
you
must
have
the
knight
sittah
i
will
not
have
him
i
pass
him
by

maybe
saladin
beware

reckon
not
without
your

stroke

the
as
if
it
were
not
purposely
thou
losest
i
find
not
my

besides
that
such
a
game
yields
very
little
pastime
when
have
i
not
by
losing
won
with
thee
when
hast
thou
not
by
way
of
comfort
to
me
for
my
lost
game
presented
twice
the
stake

so
that
it
may
have
been
on
purpose
sister
that
thou
hast
lost
at
times
sittah
at
least
my
brother
s
great
liberality
may
be
one
cause
why
i
improve
no
faster
saladin
we
forget
the
game
before
us
lot
us
make
an
end
of
it
sittah
i
and
check
again
saladin
this
countercheck
i
wasn
t
aware
of

my
queen
must
fall
the
sacrifice
sittah
let
s
could
it
be
helped
saladin
no
no
take
off
the
queen
that
is
a
piece
which
never
thrives
with
me
sittah
only
that
piece
saladin
off
with
it
i
shan
t
miss
it
thus
i
guard
all
again
sittah
how
civilly
we
should
behave
to
queens
my
brother
s
lessons
have
taught
me
but
too
well
saladin
take
her
or
not
i
stir
the
piece
no
more
sittah
why
should
i
take
her
check
saladin
go
on
sittah
check
saladin
and
sittah
hold
not
yet
you
may
advance
the
knight
and
ward
the
danger
or
as
you

saladin
it
is
so
you
are
the
winner
and
pays
let
him
be
called
sittah
you
was
not
wrong
i
seem
to
recollect
i
was
a
little
absent
one
isn
t
always
willing
to
dwell
upon
some
shapeless
bits
of
wood
coupled
with
no
idea
yet
the
imam
when
i
play
with
him
bends
with
such
the
loser
seeks
excuses
sittah
twas
not
the
shapeless
men
and
the
unmeaning
squares
that
made
me
dexterity
your
calm
sharp
eye
sittah
and
what
of
that
good
brother
is
that
to
be
th
excuse
for
your
defeat
played
more
absently
than
saladin
than
you
what
dwells
upon
your
mind
my
sittah
not
your
own
cares
i
sittah
o
saladin
when
shall
we
play
again
so
constantly
saladin
an
interruption
will
but
whet
our
zeal
you
think
of
the
campaign
well
let
it
come
it
was
not
i
who
first
unsheathed
the
sword
i
would
have
willingly
prolonged
the
truce
and
willingly
have
knit
a
closer
bond
a
lasting
given
to
my
sittah
a
husband
worthy
of
her
richard
s
brother
sittah
you
love
to
talk
of
richard
saladin
richard
s
sister
might
then
have
been
allotted
to
our
melek
o
what
a
house
that
would
have
the
what
is
earth
the
happiest
you
know
i
am
not
loth
to
praise
myself
why
should
i
my
friends
am
i
not
worthy
o
we
had
then
led
lives
sittah
a
pretty
dream
it
makes
me
smile
you
do
not
know
the
christians
you
will
not
know
them
tis
this
people
s
pride
not
to
be
men
but
to
be
christians
even
what
of
humane
their
founder
felt
and
taught
and
left
to
savour
their
found
superstition
they
value
not
because
it
is
humane
lovely
and
good
for
man
they
only
prize
it
because
twas
christ
who
taught
it
christ
who
did
it
tis
well
for
them
he
was
so
good
a
man
well
that
they
take
his
goodness
all
for
granted
and
in
his
virtues
put
their
trust
his
tis
not
his
virtues
but
his
name
alone
they
wish
to
thrust
upon
tis
his
name
which
they
desire
should
overspread
the
world
should
swallow
up
the
name
of
all
good
men
and
put
the
best
to
shame
tis
his
mere
name
they
care
saladin
else
my
sittah
as
thou
sayst
they
would
not
have
required
that
thou
and
melek
should
be
called
christians
ere
you
might
be
suffered
to
feel
for
christians
conjugal
affection
sittah
as
if
from
christians
only
and
as
christians
that
love
could
be
expected
which
our
maker
in
man
and
woman
for
each
other
planted
saladin
the
christians
do
believe
such
idle
notions
they
well
might
fancy
this
and
yet
thou
errest
the
templars
not
the
christians
are
in
fault
tis
not
as
christians
but
as
templars
that
they

i
pray
thee

be
more

saladin
that

what

then
so
earnestly
so

from
a

a

rather
than
from

touch
you
nearer
than
is
becoming
you

i
have
often
won
the

sum
of
you
at
chess
and
as
i
have
not
just
at
present
need
of
money
i
ve
left
the
sum
at
rest
in
hafi
s
chest
which

not

thus
the
stakes
are
not
yet
taken
never
fear
it
is
not
my
intention
to
bestow
them
on
thee
or
hafi
hafi
were
it
only
sittah
some
more
such
trifles
are
perhaps
unclaimed
my
own
allowance
which
you
set
apart
has
lain
some
months
untouched
hafi
nor
is
that
saladin
nor
then
hafi
since
we
have
been
expecting
the
treasure
out
of
egypt
she
not
sittah
why
listen
to
him
hafi
has
not
had
an
asper
saladin
good

been
advancing
to

has
at
her
sole
expense
maintained
thy
state
saladin
my
sittah
and
who
but
you
my
brother
could
make
me
rich
enough
to
have
the
power
hafi
and
in
a
little
time
again
will
leave
thee
poor
as
himself
saladin
i
brother
poor
when
had
i
more
when
less
than
at
this
instant
a
cloak
a
horse
a
sabre
and
a
god
what
need
i
else
with
them
what
can
be
wanting
and
yet
i
could
quarrel
with
thee
for
this
sittah
a
truce
to
that
my
brother
were
it
as
easy
to
remove
our
father
s
cares
saladin
ah
now
my
joy
thou
hast
at
once
abated
to
me
there
is
there
can
be
nothing
wanting
to
in
him
to
us
all
what
shall
i
do
from
egypt
maybe
nothing
will
come
this
long
time
only
knows
we
hear
of
no
stir
to
reduce
to
spare
i
am
quite
willing
for
myself
to
stoop
to
were
it
myself
and
only
i
should
but
what
can
that
avail
a
cloak
a
horse
a
sword
i
ne
er
can
want
to
my
god
he
is
not
to
be
bought
he
asks
but
little
only
my
heart
i
had
relied
upon
a
surplus
in
my
chest
hafi
a
surplus
and
tell
me
would
you
not
have
had
me
impaled
or
hanged
at
least
if
you
had
found
me
out
in
hoarding
up
a
surplus
those
one
may
venture
on
saladin
well
but
how
next
could
you
have
found
out
no
one
where
to
borrow
unless
of
sittah
sittah
and
would
i
have
borne
to
see
the
preference
given
to
another
i
still
lay
claim
to
it
i
am
not
as
yet
entirely
bare
saladin
not
yet
was
wanting
still
go
turn
thyself
about
take
where
and
as
thou
canst
be
quick
borrow
on
promise
contract
anyhow
but
heed
of
those
i
have
to
borrow
there
might
seem
to
ask
it
back
go
to
the
covetous
they
ll
gladliest
they
know
how
well
their
money
thrives
with
hafi
i
know
none
such
sittah
i
recollect
just
now
i
heard
of
thy
friend
s
return
hafi
of
who
should
that
be
sittah
who
thy
vaunted
jew
hafi
a
jew
and
praised
by
me
sittah
to
whom
his
god
i
think
i
still
retain
thy
own
expression
used
concerning
him
to
whom
of
all
the
good
things
of
this
world
his
god
in
full
abundance
has
bestowed
the
greatest
and
the
least
hafi
what
could
i
mean
when
i
said
so
sittah
the
least
of
good
things
riches
the
greatest
wisdom
hafi
of
a
jew
could
i
say
that
sittah
didst
thou
thy
nathan
hafi
hi
ho
of
nathan
at
that
moment
he
did
not
come
across
me
but
in
fact
he
is
at
length
come
home
and
i
suppose
is
not
ill
off
his
people
used
to
call
him
the
the
rich
sittah
the
rich
he
s
named
now
more
than
ever
the
whole
town
resounds
with
news
of
jewels
costly
stuffs
and
stores
that
he
brings
back
hafi
is
he
the
rich
he
ll
be
no
fear
of
it
once
more
the
wise
sittah
what
thinkst
thou
hafi
of
a
call
on
him
hafi
on
not
to
you
know
he
lend
therein
his
very
wisdom
lies
that
he
lends
no
one
sittah
formerly
thon
gav
st
a
very
different
picture
of
this
nathan
hafi
in
case
of
need
he
ll
lend
you
merchandise
but
money
money
never
he
s
a
jew
there
are
but
few
such
he
has
understanding
knows
life
plays
chess
but
is
in
bad
notorious
above
his
brethren
as
he
is
in
good
on
him
rely
not
to
the
poor
indeed
he
vies
perhaps
with
saladin
in
giving
though
he
distributes
less
he
gives
as
freely
as
silently
as
nobly
to
jew
christian
mahometan
or
tis
all
one
sittah
and
such
a
man
should
saladin
how
comes
it
then
i
never
heard
of
him
sittah
should
be
unwilling
to
lend
to
saladin
who
wants
for
others
not
for
himself
hafi
aye
there
peeps
out
the
jew
the
ordinary
jew
believe
me
prince
he
s
jealous
really
envious
of
your
giving
to
earn
god
s
favour
seems
his
very
business
he
lends
not
that
he
may
always
have
to
give
the
law
commandeth
mercy
not
compliance
and
thus
for
mercy
s
sake
he
s
uncomplying
tis
true
i
am
not
now
on
the
best
terms
with
nathan
but
i
must
entreat
you
think
not
that
therefore
i
would
do
injustice
to
him
he
s
good
in
everything
but
not
in
only
in
that
i
ll
knock
at
other
doors
i
just
have
recollected
an
old
moor
who
s
rich
and
go
sittah
why
in
such
hurry
hafi
saladin
let
him
go
saladin
sittah
sittah
he
hastens
like
a
man
who
would
escape
me
why
so
was
he
indeed
deceived
in
nathan
or
does
he
play
upon
us
saladin
can
i
guess
i
scarcely
know
of
whom
you
have
been
talking
and
hear
for
the
first
time
of
nathan
sittah
is
t
possible
the
man
were
hid
from
thee
of
whom
tis
said
he
has
found
out
the
tombs
of
solomon
and
david
knows
the
word
that
lifts
their
marble
lids
and
thence
obtains
the
golden
oil
that
feeds
his
shining
pomp
saladin
were
this
man
s
wealth
by
miracle
created
tis
not
at
david
s
tomb
or
solomon
s
that
twould
be
wrought
not
virtuous
men
lie
there
sittah
his
source
of
opulence
is
more
productive
and
more
exhaustless
than
a
cave
of
mammon
saladin
he
trades
i
hear
sittah
his
ships
fill
every
harbour
his
caravans
through
every
desert
toil
this
has
told
me
long
ago
with
transport
adding
nobly
nathan
bestows
what
he
esteems
it
not
a
meanness
by
prudent
industry
to
have
justly
how
free
from
prejudice
his
lofty
his
heart
to
every
virtue
how
with
every
lovely
feeling
how
familiar
saladin
yet
hafi
spake
just
now
so
coldly
of
him
sittah
not
coldly
but
with
awkwardness
confusion
as
if
he
thought
it
dangerous
to
praise
him
and
yet
knew
not
to
blame
him
undeserving
or
can
it
really
be
that
e
en
the
best
among
a
people
can
not
quite
escape
the
tinges
of
the
tribe
and
that
in
fact
has
in
this
to
blush
for
nathan
be
that
as
t
he
the
jew
or
is
he
but
is
enough
for
us
saladin
you
would
not
sister
take
his
wealth
by
force
sittah
what
do
you
mean
by
sword
oh
no
what
force
is
necessary
with
the
weak
but
their
own
weakness
come
awhile
with
me
into
my
harem
i
have
bought
a
songstress
you
have
not
heard
her
she
came
yesterday
meanwhile
i
ll
think
somewhat
about
a
project
i
have
upon
this
nathan
follow

place
of

close
to

recha
you

been
so
very
slow
my
dearest
father
you
now
will
hardly
be
in

to
find

well
if
not
here
beneath
the
palms
yet
surely
elsewhere
my
child
be
satisfied
see
see
is
not
that
daya
making
towards
us
recha
she
certainly
has
lost
him
then
nathan
why
so
recha
else
she
d
walk
quicker

she
may
not
have
seen
us
recha
there
now

her
speed
redoubles

calm

recha
recha
would
you
have
your
daughter
be
cool
and
unconcerned
who
twas
that
saved
her
heed
not
to
whom
is
due
the
life

prizes
chiefly
because
she
owed
it
first
to
thee
nathan
i
would
not
wish
thee
other
than
thou
art
e
en
if
i
knew
that
in
thy
secret
soul
a
very
different
emotion
throbs
recha

dost
thou
ask
of
me
so
tremblingly
of
me
what
passes
in
thee
whatever
tis
tis
innocence
and
nature
be
not
alarmed
it
gives
me
no
alarm
but
promise
me
that
when
thy
heart
shall
speak
a
plainer
language
thou
wilt
not
conceal
a
single
of
thy
wishes
from
my
fondness
recha
oh
the
mere
possibility
of
wishing
rather
to
veil
and
hide
them
makes
me
shudder
nathan
let
this
be
spoken
once
for
all
well
nathan
recha
daya
daya
he
still
is
here
beneath
the
palms
and
soon
will
reach
yon
wall

there
he
comes
recha
and
seems
irresolute
where
next
if
left
or
right
daya
i
know
he
mostly
passes
to
the
convent
and
therefore
comes
this
path
what
will
you
lay
me
recha
oh
yes
he
does
and
did
you
speak
to
him
how
did
he
seem

let
him
see
you
with
me
further

rather
to

house
recha
just
one
peep
more
now
the
hedge
steals
him
from

daya
come
away
your
father
s
in
the
he
perceive
us
tis
very
probable
he
ll
tack
about
recha
but
for
the
nathan
now
he
emerges
from
it
he
can
t
but
see
you
ask
it
of
you
daya
i
know
a
window
whence
we
yet
recha
ay
in
with
nathan
i
m
almost
shy
of
this
strange
fellow
almost
shrink
back
from
his
rough
virtue
that
one
man
should
ever
make
another
man
feel
awkward
and
s
god
the
youth
looks
like
a
man
i
love
his
daring
eye
his
open
gait
may
be
the
shell
is
bitter
but
not
the
kernel
surely
i
have
seen
some
such
methinks
forgive
me
noble
frank
nathan
templar
templar
what
nathan
give
me
leave
templar
well
jew
what
wouldst
thou
have
nathan
the
liberty
of
speaking
to
you
templar
can
i
prevent
it
quick
then
what
s
your
business
nathan
hasten
quite
so
proudly
by
a
man
who
has
not
merited
contempt
and
whom
for
evermore
you
ve
made
your
debtor
templar
how
so
perhaps
i
you
nathan
my
name
is
nathan
father
to
the
maid
your
generous
courage
snatched
from
circling
flames
and
templar
if
with
thanks
keep
keep
them
all
those
little
things
i
ve
had
to
suffer
much
from
too
much
already
far
and
after
all
you
owe
me
nothing
was
i
ever
told
she
was
your
daughter
tis
a
templar
s
duty
to
rush
to
the
assistance
of
the
first
poor
wight
that
needs
him
and
my
life
just
then
was
quite
a
burden
i
was
mighty
glad
to
risk
it
for
another
tho
it
were
that
of
a
jewess
nathan
noble
and
yet
shocking
the
turn
might
be
expected
modest
greatness
wears
willingly
the
mask
of
what
is
shocking
to
scare
off
admiration
but
altho
she
may
disdain
the
tribute
admiration
is
there
no
other
tribute
she
can
bear
with
knight
were
you
here
not
foreign
not
a
captive
i
would
not
ask
so
freely
speak
command
in
what
can
i
be
useful
templar
nothing
nathan
i
m
rich
templar
to
me
the
richer
jew
ne
er
seemed
the
bettor
jew
nathan
is
that
a
reason
why
you
should
not
use
the
better
part
of
him
his
wealth
templar
well
well
i
ll
not
refuse
it
wholly
for
my
poor
mantle
s
that
is
threadbare
and
spite
of
darning
will
not
hold
together
i
ll
come
and
borrow
cloth
or
money
of
thee
to
make
me
up
a
new
one
don
t
look
solemn
the
danger
is
not
pressing
tis
not
yet
at
the
last
gasp
but
tight
and
strong
and
good
save
this
poor
corner
where
an
ugly
spot
you
see
is
singed
upon
it
it
got
singed
as
i
bore
off
your
daughter
from
the
fire
nathan
hold
of
the
tis
singular
that
such
an
ugly
spot
bears
better
testimony
to
the
man
than
his
own
mouth
this
i
could
kiss
it
your
i
meant
not
templar
what
nathan
a
tear
fell
on
the
spot
templar
you
ll
find
up
more
such
this
jew
methinks
begins
to
work
upon
me
nathan
would
you
send
once
this
mantle
to
my
daughter
templar
why
nathan
that
her
lips
may
cling
to
this
dear
speck
for

not

you
scorned
to
try
her
lest
you
should
be
victor
for
that
i
also
thank
you
templar
i
confess
you
know
how
templars
ought
to
think
nathan
still
and
only
to
all
because
the
rules
and
vows
enjoin
it
to
the
i
know
how
good
men
that
all
lands
produce
good
men
templar
but
not
without
distinction
nathan
in
colour
dress
and
shape
perhaps
distinguished
templar

nathan

with

let
not
the
upper
branch
alone
pretend
not
to
have
started
from
the
common
earth
templar
well
said
and
yet
i
trust
you
know
the
nation
that
first
began
to
strike
at
fellow
men
that
first
baptised
itself
the
chosen
how
now
if
i
to
hate
this
people
yet
for
its
pride
could
not
forbear
to
scorn
it
the
pride
which
it
to
mussulman
and
christian
bequeathed
as
were
its
god
alone
the
true
one
you
start
that
i
a
christian
and
a
templar
talk
thus
where
when
has
e
er
the
pious
rage
to
own
the
better
the
whole
world
to
force
this
better
as
the
best
of
shown
itself
more
and
in
a
blacker
form
than
here
than
now
to
him
whom
here
and
now
the
film
is
not
removing
from
his
but
be
he
blind
that
wills
forget
my
speeches
and
leave
me
nathan
ah
indeed
you
do
not
know
how
closer
i
shall
cling
to
you
henceforth
we
must
we
will
be
friends
despise
my
we
did
not
choose
a
nation
for
ourselves
are
we
our
nations
what
s
a
nation
then
were
jews
and
christians
such
e
er
they
were
men
and
have
i
found
in
thee
one
more
to
whom
it
is
enough
to
be
a
man
templar
that
hast
thou
nathan
by
god
thou
hast
thy
hand
i
blush
to
have
mistaken
thee
a
single
instant
nathan
and
i
am
proud
of
it
only
common
souls
we
seldom
err
in
templar
and
uncommon
ones
seldom
forget
yes
nathan
yes
we
must
we
will
be
friends
nathan
we
are
so
and
my
she
will
rejoice
how
sweet
the
wider
prospect
that
dawns
upon
me
do
but
know
templar
i
am
impatient
for
it
who
is
that
bursts
from
your
house
methinks
it
is
your
daya
nathan
so
templar
sure
to
our
recha
nothing
has
happened
nathan
templar
daya
daya
nathan
nathan
nathan
well
daya
forgive
me
knight
that
i
must
interrupt
you
nathan
what
is
the
matter
templar
what
daya
the
sultan
the
sultan
wants
to
see
a
hurry
jesus
the
nathan
saladin
wants
me
he
will
be
curious
to
see
what
wares
precious
or
new
i
brought
with
me
from
persia
say
there
is
nothing
hardly
yet
unpacked
daya
no
no
tis
not
to
look
at
anything
he
wants
to
speak
to
you
to
you
in
person
and
orders
you
to
come
as
soon
as
may
be
nathan
i
ll
daya
knight
take
it
not
amiss
but
we
were
so
alarmed
for
what
the
sultan
could
have
in
view
nathan
that
i
shall
soon
discover
nathan
templar
templar
and
don
t
you
know
him
yet
i
mean
his
person
nathan
whose
saladin
s
not
yet
i
ve
neither
shunned
nor
sought
to
see
him
and
the
general
voice
speaks
too
well
of
him
for
me
not
to
wish
rather
to
take
its
language
upon
trust
than
sift
the
truth
out
it
be
he
by
the
saving
of
your
life
has
templar
yes
it
is
so
the
life
i
live
he
gave
nathan
and
in
it
double
treble
life
to
me
this
flings
a
bond
about
me
which
shall
tie
me
for
ever
to
his
service
and
i
scarcely
like
to
defer
inquiring
for
his
wishes
for
everything
i
am
ready
and
am
ready
to
own
that
tis
on
your
account
i
am
so
templar
as
often
as
i
ve
thrown
me
in
his
way
i
have
not
found
as
yet
the
means
to
thank
him
the
impression
that
i
made
upon
him
came
quickly
and
so
has
vanished
now
perhaps
he
recollects
me
not
who
knows
once
more
at
least
he
must
recall
me
to
his
mind
fully
to
fix
my
doom
tis
not
enough
that
by
his
order
i
am
yet
in
being
by
his
permission
live
i
have
to
learn
according
to
whose
will
i
must
exist
nathan
therefore
i
shall
the
more
avoid
delay
perchance
some
word
may
furnish
me
occasion
to
glance
at
me
knight
i
am
in
haste
when
shall
we
see
you
with
us
templar
soon
as
i
may
nathan
that
is
whene
er
you
will
templar
then
nathan
and
your
name
templar
my
name
conrade
of
stauffen
nathan
conrade
of
stauffen
stauffen
templar
why
does
that
strike
so
forcibly
upon
you
nathan
there
are
more
races
of
that
name
no
doubt
templar
yes
many
of
that
name
were
here
my
uncle
should
say
my
father
but
wherefore
is
your
look
so
sharpened
on
me
nathan
can
i
weary
to
behold
templar
therefore
i
quit
you
first
the
searching
eye
finds
often
more
than
it
desires
to
see
i
fear
it
nathan
fare
thee
well
let
time
not
curiosity
make
us
acquainted
nathan
soon
daya
nathan
the
searching
eye
will
oft
discover
more
than
it
desires
tis
as
he
read
my
soul
that
too
may
chance
to
me
tis
not
alone
leonard
s
walk
stature
but
his
very
voice
leonard
so
wore
his
head
was
even
wont
just
so
to
brush
his
eyebrows
with
his
hand
as
if
to
mask
the
fire
that
fills
his
look
those
deeply
graven
images
at
times
how
they
will
slumber
in
us
seem
forgotten
when
all
at
once
a
word
a
tone
a
gesture
retraces
all
of
stauffen
ay
filnek
and
will
soon
know
but
first
to
daya
there
why
on
the
watch
come
nearer
by
this
time
i
ll
answer
for
t
you
ve
something
more
at
heart
than
to
know
what
the
sultan
wants
with
me
daya
and
do
you
take
it
ill
in
part
of
her
you
were
beginning
to
converse
with
him
more
confidentially
just
as
the
message
sent
by
the
sultan
tore
us
from
the
window
nathan
go
tell
her
that
she
may
expect
his
visit
at
every
instant
daya
what
nathan
i
think
i
can
rely
upon
thee
daya
be
on
thy
guard
i
beg
thou
lt
not
repent
it
be
but
discreet
thy
conscience
too
will
surely
find
its
account
in
t
do
not
mar
my
plans
but
leave
them
to
themselves
relate
and
question
with
modesty
with
backwardness
daya
oh
fear
not
how
come
you
to
preach
up
all
this
to
me
i
too
the
sultan
sends
for
you
a
second
time
and
by
your
friend
nathan
hafi
hafi
ha
art
thou
here
i
was
now
seeking
for
thee
nathan
why
in
such
haste
what
wants
he
then
with
me
hafi
who
nathan
saladin
i
m
am
coming
hafi
where
to
the
sultan
s
nathan
was
t
not
he
who
sent
thee
hafi
me
no
and
has
he
sent
already
nathan
yes
hafi
then
tis
all
right
nathan
what
s
right
hafi
that
i
m
unguilty
god
knows
i
am
not
guilty
knows
i
what
said
i
not
of
to
ward
it
off
nathan
to
ward
off
plain
hafi
that
them
art
now
become
his
defterdar
i
pity
thee
behold
it
i
will
not
i
go
this
very
road
i
told
thee
thou
orders
by
the
and
then
adieu
indeed
they
must
not
be
such
business
as
a
naked
man
can
t
carry
quick
what
s
thy
pleasure
nathan
recollect
yourself
as
yet
all
this
is
quite
a
riddle
to
me
i
know
of
nothing
hafi
where
are
then
thy
bags
nathan
bags
hafi
bags
of
money
bring
the
weightiest
forth
the
money
thou
rt
to
lend
the
sultan
nathan
nathan
and
is
that
all
hafi
novice
thou
st
yet
to
learn
how
he
day
after
day
will
scoop
and
scoop
till
nothing
but
an
hollow
empty
paring
a
husk
as
light
as
film
is
left
behind
thou
st
yet
to
learn
how
prodigality
from
prudent
bounty
s
coffers
borrows
and
borrows
till
there
s
not
a
purse
left
to
keep
rats
from
starving
thou
mayst
fancy
that
he
who
wants
thy
gold
will
heed
thy
counsel
but
when
has
he
yet
listened
to
advice
imagine
now
what
just
befell
me
with
him
nathan
hafi
i
went
in
and
found
him
with
his
sister
engaged
or
rather
rising
up
from
chess
sittah
amiss
upon
the
board
the
game
that
saladin
supposed
was
lost
and
had
given
up
yet
stood
when
i
drew
nigh
and
had
examined
it
i
soon
discovered
it
was
not
gone
by
any
means
nathan
for
you
a
blest
discovery
a
hafi
he
only
needed
to
remove
his
king
behind
the
tower
t
have
got
him
out
of
check
could
i
but
make
you
nathan
i
ll
trust
thee
hafi
then
with
the
knight
still
would
have
shown
him
and
called
him
to
the
must
have
won
but
what
d
ye
think
he
did
nathan
dared
doubt
your
insight
hafi
he
would
not
listen
but
with
scorn
o
erthrew
the
standing
pieces
nathan
is
that
possible
hafi
and
said
he
chose
to
be
chose
is
that
to
play
the
game
nathan
most
surely
not
tis
to
play
with
the
game
hafi
and
yet
the
stake
was
not
a
nathan
money
here
or
there
matters
but
little
not
to
listen
to
thee
and
on
a
point
of
such
importance
hafi
there
lies
the
rub
not
even
to
admire
thine
eagle
comprehensive
that
calls
for
vengeance
it
not
hafi
i
only
tell
it
to
thee
that
thou
mayst
see
how
his
brain
s
formed
i
bear
with
him
no
longer
here
i
ve
been
running
to
each
dirty
moor
inquiring
who
will
lend
him
i
who
ne
er
went
for
myself
a
begging
go
a
borrowing
and
that
for
others
borrowing
s
much
the
same
as
begging
just
as
lending
upon
usury
is
much
the
same
as
makes
not
of
lewdness
virtue
on
the
ganges
among
my
ghebers
i
have
need
of
neither
nor
need
i
be
the
tool
or
pimp
of
upon
the
ganges
only
there
are
men
here
thou
alone
art
somehow
almost
worthy
to
have
lived
upon
the
ganges
wilt
thou
with
me
and
leave
him
with
the
captive
cloak
alone
the
booty
that
he
wants
to
strip
thee
of
little
by
little
he
will
flay
thee
clean
thins
thou
lt
be
quit
at
once
without
the
tease
of
being
sliced
to
death
come
wilt
thou
with
me
i

find
thee
with
a
staff
nathan
i
should
have
thought
come
what
come

that
thy
resource
remained
but
i

consider
of
it

such
things
must
not
be
considered

that
are

at

the
very
one

brings

had
brought
him
in
recha

comes

thee
into

prating
of

thou

some
strange
unseemly
notions
whom
he
fights

a
god
belonging
to
a
another
to
fight
his
battles
and
can
we
pronounce
which
among
the
scattered
clods
of
earth
you
i
was
born
unless
it
be
for
that
which
we
were
produced
if
nathan
heard
what
has
my
father
done
to
thee
that
thou
hast
ever
sought
to
paint
my
happiness
as
lying
far
remote
from
him
and
his
what
has
he
done
to
thee
that
thus
among
the
seeds
of
reason
which
he
sowed
unmixed
pure
in
my
soul
thou
ever
must
be
seeking
to
plant
the
weeds
or
flowers
of
thy
own
land
he
wills
not
of
these
pranking
gaudy
blossoms
upon
this
soil
and
i
too
must
acknowledge
i
feel
as
if
they
had
a
odour
that
makes
me
half
suffocates
thy
head
is
wont
to
bear
it
i
don
t
blame
those
stronger
nerves
that
can
support
it
mine
it
behoves
not
latterly
thy
angel
had
made
me
half
a
fool
i
am
ashamed
whene
er
i
see
my
father
of
the
folly
daya
as
if
here
only
wisdom
were
at
i
dared
speak
recha
and
dar
st
thou
not
when
was
i
not
all
ear
if
thou
beganst
to
talk
about
the
heroes
of
thy
faith
have
i
not
freely
on
their
deeds
bestowed
my
admiration
to
their
sufferings
yielded
the
tribute
of
my
tears
their
faith
indeed
has
never
seemed
their
most
heroic
side
to
me
yet
therefore
have
i
only
learnt
to
find
more
consolation
in
the
thought
that
our
devotion
to
the
god
of
all
depends
not
on
our
notions
about
god
my
father
has
so
often
told
us
thou
hast
so
often
to
this
point
how
can
it
be
that
thou
alone
art
restless
to
undermine
what
you
built
up
together
this
is
not
the
most
fit
discussion
daya
to
usher
in
our
friend
to
tho
indeed
i
should
not
disincline
to
to
me
it
is
of
infinite
importance
if
he
s
some
one
at
the
door
if
it
were
slave
who
shows
in
the
they
this

at

feet
of
this
proud
man
i
will
alone

have
no
thanks
no
more
than
will
the
bucket
which
was
busy
in
showering
watery
damps

flame
that
was
filled

thee

the
fire
i
dropped
by
chance
into

remained
a
fluttering
spark
upon

not

pushed
us
both

conflagration
what
room
is
here
for
thanks
how
oft
in
europe

men
to
very
different
deeds
templars
must
so
behave
it
is
their
office
like
better
taught

rather
handier
spaniels
to
fetch
from
out
of

in
hasty
moments

idle

that
left

is
too
piercing
a
revenge
indeed

if
henceforth

question
if
these
barbed
words

alighted

have
much
disserved

ah

sister
sittah
you
seem
as
if
a

were
impending
saladin
with
weapons
that
i
have
not

must
i
disguise
myself
i
use
precautions

lay
a

that
knowledge

this
for
what
to

descend

at

each
little
thing
despised
too
much
finds
methods
of
revenge
saladin
tis
but
too
true
and
if
this
jew
should
prove
the
fair
good
man
as
once
the
dervis
sittah
then
difficulties
cease
a
snare
concerns
the
avaricious
cautious
fearful
jew
and
not
the
good
wise
man
for
he
is
ours
without
a

then
the
delight
of
hearing
how
such
a
man
speaks
out
with
what
stern
strength
he
tears
the
net
or
with
what
prudent
foresight
he
one
by
one
undoes
the
tangled
meshes
that
will
be
all
to
saladin
that
i
shall
joy
in

what
then
should
trouble
thee
for
if
he
be
one
of
the

only
a

will
not
blush
to
such

to
seem
a
man
as
he
thinks
all
mankind
to
be
one
that
to
him
should
bear
a
better

would
seem
a
dupe
saladin
so
that
i
must
act
badly

badly

sittah
yes
if
you

if
it
named
him
so
in

prudent
one

who

of

enough
ever

it
where

seeks

is
vexing
let

to

thy

thou

the

shalt
have

what

you

my

shall
be
called
to

with
you
for
them
so
much
for
the
sly
listener
i
have
nothing
to
transact
now
with
the
merchant
nathan
doubtless
then
you
would
learn
what
on
my
journey
i
noticed
of
the
motions
of
the
foe
who
stirs
anew
if
unreserved
i
saladin
neither
was
that
the
object
of
my
sending
i
know
what
i
have
need
to
know
already
in
short
i
willed
your
nathan
sultan
order
saladin
to
gain
instruction
quite
on
other
points
since
you
are
a
man
so
wise
tell
me
which
law
which
faith
appears
to
you
the
better
nathan
sultan
i
am
a
jew
saladin
and
i
a
mussulman
the
christian
stands
between
us
of
these
three
religions
only
one
came
be
the
true
a
man
like
you
remains
not
just
where
birth
has
chanced
to
cast
him
or
if
he
remains
there
does
it
from
insight
choice
from
grounds
of
preference
share
then
with
me
your
me
hear
the
grounds
of
preference
which
i
have
wanted
the
leisure
to
the
choice
these
grounds
have
motived
that
it
may
be
mine
in
confidence
i
ask
it
how
you
startle
and
weigh
me
with
your
eye
it
may
well
be
i
m
the
first
sultan
to
whom
this
caprice
methinks
not
quite
unworthy
of
a
sultan
has
yet
occurred
am
i
not
speak
or
do
you
to
collect
yourself
desire
some
moments
of
give
them
whether
she
s
listening
must
know
of
her
if
i
ve
done
right
ll
soon
steps
into
the
room
to
which
sittah
had
nathan
strange
how
is
this
what
wills
the
sultan
of
me
i
came
prepared
with
asks
truth
truth
as
if
truth
too
were
coin
disused
that
goes
by
tis
some
such
but
a
new
coin
known
by
the
stamp
at
once
to
be
flung
down
and
told
upon
the
counter
it
is
not
that
like
gold
in
bags
tied
up
so
truth
lies
hoarded
in
the
wise
man
s
head
to
be
brought
now
in
this
transaction
which
of
us
plays
the
jew
he
asks
for
truth
is
truth
what
he
requires
his
aim
his
end
that
this
is
but
the
glue
to
lime
a
snare
ought
not
to
be
suspected
twere
too
little
yet
what
is
found
too
little
for
the
in
fact
through
hedge
and
pale
to
stalk
at
once
into

round

for
the
path

leave
to
pass
the

must
be
cautious
yet
to
damp
him
back
and
be
the
stubborn
jew
is
not
the
thing
and
wholly
to
throw
off
the
jew
still
less
for
if
no
jew
he
might
with
right
why
not
a
may
serve
me
not
children
only
can
be
quieted
with
stories
ha
he
let
him
come
saladin
so
there
the
field
is
clear
i
m
not
too
quick
thou
hast
bethought
thyself
as
much
as
need
is
speak
no
one
hears
nathan
might
the
whole
world
but
hear
us
saladin
is
nathan
of
his
cause
so
confident
yes
that
i
call
the

no
truth
for
truth
to
hazard
all
things
life
and
goods
nathan
aye
when
tis
necessary
and
when
useful
saladin
henceforth
i
hope
i
shall
with
reason
bear
one
of
my
betterer
of
the
world
and
of
the
nathan
in
truth
a
noble
title
but
sultan
e
er
i
quite
unfold
myself
allow
me
to
relate
a
tale
saladin
why
not
i
always
was
a
friend
of
tales
well
told
nathan
well
told
that
s
not
precisely
my
affair
saladin
again
so
proudly
modest
come
begin
nathan
in
days
of
yore
there
dwelt
in
east
a
man
who
from
a
valued
hand
received
a
ring
of
endless
worth
the
stone
of
it
an
opal
that
shot
an
tint
moreover
it
had
the
hidden
virtue
him
to
render
of
god
and
man
beloved
who
in
this
view
and
this
persuasion
wore
it
was
it
strange
the
eastern
man
ne
er
drew
it
off
his
finger
and
studiously
provided
to
secure
it
for
ever
to
his
house
bequeathed
it
first
to
the
of
his
sons
ordained
that
he
again
should
leave
the
ring
to
the
among
his
that
without
heeding
birth
the
son
in
virtue
of
the
ring
alone
should
always
remain
the
lord
o
th
hear
me
sultan
saladin
i
understand
nathan
from
son
to
son
at
length
this
ring
descended
to
a
father
who
had
three
sons
alike
obedient
to
him
whom
therefore
he
could
not
but
love
alike
at
times
seemed
this
now
that
at
times
the
third
accordingly
as
each
apart
received
the
overflowings
of
his
heart
most
worthy
to
heir
the
ring
which
with
weakness
he
privately
to
each
in
turn
had
promised
this
went
on
for
a
while
but
death
approached
and
the
good
father
grew
embarrassed
so
to
disappoint
two
sons
who
trust
his
promise
he
could
not
bear
what
s
to
be
done
he
sends
in
secret
to
a
jeweller
of
whom
upon
the
model
of
the
real
ring
he
might
bespeak
two
others
and
commanded
to
spare
nor
cost
nor
pains
to
make
them
like
quite
like
the
true
one
this
the
artist
managed
the
rings
were
brought
and
e
en
the
father
s
eye
could
not
distinguish
which
had
been
the
model
quite
overjoyed
he
summons
all
his
sons
takes
leave
of
each
apart
on
each
bestows
his
blessing
and
his
ring
and
hearest
me
saladin
i
hear
i
hear
come
finish
with
thy
tale
is
it
soon
ended
nathan
it
is
ended
sultan
for
all
that
follows
may
be
guessed
of
course
scarce
is
the
father
dead
each
with
his
ring
appears
and
claims
to
be
the
lord
o
th
house
comes
question
strife
to
no
end
for
the
true
ring
could
no
more
be
distinguished
than
now
true
faith
saladin
how
how
is
that
to
be
the
answer
to
my
query
nathan
no
but
it
may
serve
as
my
apology
if
i
can
t
venture
to
decide
between
rings
which
the
father
got
expressly
made
that
they
might
not
be
known
from
one
another
saladin
the
t
trifle
with
me
i
must
think
that
the
religions
which
i
named
can
be
distinguished
e
en
to
raiment
drink
and
food
nathan
and
only
not
as
to
their
grounds
of
proof
are
not
all
built
alike
on
history
traditional
or
written
history
must
be
received
on
it
not
so
in
whom
now
are
we
likeliest
to
put
trust
in
our
own
people
surely
in
those
men
whose
blood
we
are
in
them
who
from
our
childhood
have
given
us
proofs
of
love
who
ne
er
deceived
us
unless
twere
wholesomer
to
be
deceived
how
can
i
less
believe
in
my
forefathers
than
thou
in
thine
how
can
i
ask
of
thee
to
own
that
thy
forefathers
falsified
in
order
to
yield
mine
the
praise
of
truth
the
like
of
christians
saladin
by
the
living
god
the
man
is
in
the
right
i
must
be
silent
nathan
now
let
us
to
our
rings
return
once
more
as
said
the
sons
complained
each
to
the
judge
swore
from
his
father
s
hand
immediately
to
have
received
the
ring
as
was
the
case
after
he
had
long
obtained
the
father
s
promise
one
day
to
have
the
ring
as
also
was
the
father
each
asserted
could
to
him
not
have
been
false
rather
than
so
suspect
of
such
a
father
willing
as
he
might
be
with
charity
to
judge
his
brethren
he
of
treacherous
forgery
was
bold
t
accuse
them
saladin
well
and
the
judge
i
m
eager
now
to
hear
what
thou
wilt
make
him
say
go
on
go
on
nathan
the
judge
said
if
ye
summon
not
the
father
before
my
seat
i
can
not
give
a
sentence
am
i
to
guess
enigmas
or
expect
ye
that
the
true
ring
should
here
unseal
its
lips
but
tell
me
that
the
real
ring
enjoys
the
hidden
power
to
make
the
wearer
of
god
and
man
beloved
let
that
decide
which
of
you
do
two
brothers
love
the
best
you
re
silent
do
these
rings
act
inward
only
not
without
does
each
love
but
himself
ye
re
all
deceived
deceivers
none
of
your
rings
is
true
the
real
ring
perhaps
is
gone
to
hide
or
to
supply
its
loss
your
father
ordered
three
for
one
saladin
o
charming
charming
nathan
and
the
judge
continued
if
you
will
take
advice
in
lieu
of
sentence
this
is
my
counsel
to
you
to
take
up
the
matter
where
it
stands
if
each
of
you
has
had
a
ring
presented
by
his
father
let
each
believe
his
own
the
real
ring
tis
possible
the
father
chose
no
longer
to
tolerate
the
one
ring
s
tyranny
and
certainly
as
he
much
loved
you
all
and
loved
you
all
alike
it
could
not
please
him
by
favouring
one
to
be
of
two
the
oppressor
let
each
feel
honoured
by
this
free
affection
unwarped
of
prejudice
let
each
endeavour
to
vie
with
both
his
brothers
in
displaying
the
virtue
of
his
ring
assist
its
might
with
gentleness
benevolence
forbearance
with
inward
resignation
to
the
godhead
and
if
the
virtues
of
the
ring
continue
to
show
themselves
among
your
children
s
children
after
a
thousand
thousand
years
appear
before
this
greater
one
than
i
shall
sit
upon
it
and
decide
so
spake
the
modest
judge
saladin
god
nathan
saladin
feel
st
thou
thyself
this
wiser
promised
man
saladin
i
dust
i
nothing
god
himself
upon
takes
hold
of
his
he
does
not
quit
the
remainder
of
the

what
moves
thee
sultan

nathan
my
dearest
nathan

the

thousand
thousand
years
are
past

love
me
nathan

saladin
then
nothing
else
to
order
saladin
no
nathan
nothing
saladin
nothing
in
the
least
and
wherefore
nathan
i
could
have
wished
an
opportunity
to
lay
a
prayer
before
you
saladin
is
there
need
of
opportunity
for
that
speak
freely
nathan
i
come
from
a
long
journey
from
collecting
debts
and
i
ve
almost
of
hard
cash
too
much
the
times
look
know
not
where
to
lodge
it
was
thinking
thou
for
coming
wars
require
large
sums
couldst
use
it
saladin
nathan
i
ask
not
if
thou
sawst
i
ll
not
examine
if
some
shrewd
suspicion
spurs
thee
to
make
this
offer
of
thyself
nathan
saladin
i
deserve
this
offer
pardon
for
what
avails
concealment
i
acknowledge
i
was
nathan
to
ask
the
same
of
me
saladin
yes
nathan
then
tis
well
we
re
both
accommodated
that
i
can
t
send
thee
all
i
have
of
treasure
arises
from
the
templar
thou
must
know
him
i
have
a
weighty
debt
to
pay
to
him
saladin
a
templar
how
thou
dost
not
with
thy
gold
support
my
direst
foes
nathan
i
speak
of
him
whose
life
the
saladin
what
art
thou
recalling
i
had
forgot
the
youth
whence
is
he
knowest
thou
nathan
hast
thou
not
heard
then
how
thy
clemency
to
him
has
fallen
on
me
he
at
the
risk
of
his
existence
from
the
flames
rescued
my
daughter
saladin
ha
has
he
done
that
he
looked
like
one
that
brother
too
whom
he
s
so
like
bad
done
it
is
he
here
still
bring
him
to
have
so
often
talked
to
sittah
of
this
brother
whom
she
knew
not
that
i
must
let
her
see
his
counterfeit
go
fetch
him
how
a
single
worthy
action
though
but
of
whim
or
passion
born
gives
rise
to
other
blessings
fetch
him
nathan
in
an
instant
the
rest
remains
as
settled
saladin
o
i
wish
i
had
let
my
sister
listen
well
i
ll
to
her
how
shall
i
make
her
privy
to
all
this
place
of
palms
the
templar
and
templar
here
let
the
weary
victim
pant
yet
would
i
not
have
time
to
ascertain
what
passes
in
me
would
not
snuff
beforehand
the
coming
storm
tis
sure
i
fled
in
vain
but
more
than
fly
i
could
not
do
whatever
comes
of
it
ah
to
ward
it
blow
was
given
so
suddenly
long
much
i
strove
to
keep
aloof
but
vainly
once
to
see
her
whom
i
surely
did
not
court
the
sight
of
to
see
her
and
to
form
the
resolution
never
to
lose
sight
of
her
here
again
was
resolution
tis
will
fixt
purpose
made
for
i
was
passive
in
it
sealed
doomed
to
see
her
and
to
feel
myself
bound
to
her
wove
into
her
very
being
was
one
separate
from
her
to
live
is
quite
death
and
wheresoever
after
death
we
be
there
too
the
thought
were
death
and
is
this
love
yet
so
in
troth
the
templar
the
christian
loves
the
jewess
what
of
that
here
in
this
holy
land
and
therefore
holy
and
dear
to
me
i
have
already
doffed
some
says
my
vow
as
templar
i
am
dead
was
dead
to
that
from
the
same
hour
which
made
me
prisoner
to
saladin
but
is
the
head
he
gave
me
my
old
one
no
it
knows
no
word
of
what
was
prated
into
yon
of
what
had
bound
it
it
is
a
better
for
its
patrial
sky
fitter
than
yon
i
m
conscious
of
it
with
this
i
now
begin
to
think
as
here
my
father
must
have
thought
if
tales
of
him
have
not
been
told
untruly
tales
they
re
credible
than
now
that
i
m
on
the
brink
of
stumbling
where
he
fell
he
fell
i
d
rather
fall
with
men
than
stand
with
children
his
example
pledges
his
approbation
and
whose
approbation
have
i
else
need
of
nathan
s
surely
of
his
encouragement
applause
i
ve
little
need
to
what
a
jew
is
he
yet
easy
to
pass
for
the
mere
jew
he
s
and
looks
leaves
saladin
with
other
looks
hoa

conrade
this
man

fame
outstrips
him
not
his
fame

but
his
shadow
but
before
all
i
have
to
tell
templar
what
nathan
that
he
would
speak
with
you
and
that
directly
first
to
my
house
where
i
would
give
some
orders

to
the
sultan

wilt
promise
that

for
ever
ever

behold
her
nathan
how
should
i
take
this
templar
suddenly
upon
his
my
father

a
man
push
me
not
from
thee
nathan
dearest
dearest
friend
templar

son
not
if
thy
daughter

gratitude
had
in
her
bosom
prepared
the
way
for
even
if
both
wait
thy
nod
alone
to
be
but
one
you
do
not
speak
nathan
young
knight
you
have
surprised
me
templar
do
i
surprise

thee
nathan
with
thy
own
thought
canst
thou
not
in
my
mouth
know
it
again
do
i
surprise
you
nathan
ere
i
know
which
of
the
stauffens
was
your
father
templar
what
say
you
nathan
in
such
a
moment
is
curiosity
your
only
feeling
nathan
for
see
once
i
myself
well
knew
a
stauffen
whose
name
was
conrade
templar
well
and
if
my
father
was
bearer
of
that
name
nathan
indeed
templar
my
name
is
from
my
father
s
conrade
nathan
then
thy
father
was
not
my
conrade
he
was
like
thyself
a
templar
never
wedded
templar
for
all
nathan
how
templar
for
all
that
he
may
have
been
my
father
nathan
you
joke
templar
and
you
are
captious
boots
it
then
to
be
does
bastard
wound
thine
ear
the
race
is
not
to
be
despised
but
hold
spare
me
my
pedigree
i
ll
spare
thee
thine
not
that
i
doubt
thy
genealogic
tree
o
god
forbid
you
may
attest
it
all
as
far
as
abraham
back
and
backwarder
i
know
it
to
my
ll
swear
to
it
also
nathan
knight
you
grow
bitter

have
i
refused

i
ve
but
forborne
to
close
with
you
at
the
first

o
then

but
come
with
me

thy
house

a
burning
soil
here

await
thee

again
to
see
her
i
shall
see
her
times
enough
if
not
i
have
already
gazed
too
much
nathan
i
ll
try
to
be
soon
back
templar
too
much
strange
that
the
human
brain
so
infinite
of
comprehension
yet
at
times
will
fill
quite
full
and
all
at
once
of
a
mere
no
matter
what
it
teems
with
patience
patience
the
soul
soon
calms
again
th
upboiling
stuff
makes
itself
room
and
brings
back
light
and
order
is
this
then
the
first
time
i
love
or
was
what
by
that
name
i
knew
before
not
and
this
this
love
alone
that
now
i
feel
daya
templar
daya
sir
knight
sir
knight
templar
who
calls
ha
daya
you
daya
i
managed
to
slip
by
him
no
come
here
he
ll
see
us
where
you
stand
behind
this
tree
templar
why
so
mysterious
what
s
the
matter
daya
daya
yes
tis
a
secret
that
has
brought
me
to
you
a
twofold
secret
one
i
only
know
the
other
only
you
let
s
interchange
intrust
yours
first
to
me
then
i
ll
tell
mine
templar
with
pleasure
when
i
m
able
to
discover
what
you
call
me
but
that
yours
will
explain
daya
that
is
not
fair
yours
first
sir
knight
for
be
assured
my
secret
serves
you
not
unless
i
have
yours
first
if
i
sift
it
out
you
ll
not
have
trusted
me
and
then
my
secret
is
still
my
own
and
yours
lost
all
for
nothing
but
knight
how
can
you
men
so
fondly
fancy
you
ever
hide
such
secrets
from
us
women
templar
secrets
we
often
are
unconscious
of
daya
may
then
i
must
at
last
be
friendly
and
break
it
to
you
tell
me
now
whence
came
it
that
all
at
once
you
started
up
abruptly
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
were
fled
that
you
left
us
without
one
civil
speech
that
you
return
no
more
with
nathan
to
has
recha
then
made
such
a
slight
impression
or
made
so
deep
a
one
i
penetrate
you
think
you
that
on
a
limed
twig
the
poor
bird
can
flutter
cheerfully
or
hop
at
ease
with
its
wing
pinioned
come
come
in
one
word
acknowledge
to
me
plainly
that
you
love
her
love
her
to
madness
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
templar
to
madness
oh
you
re
very
penetrating
daya
grant
me
the
love
and
i
ll
give
up
the
madness
templar
because
that
must
be
understood
of
a
templar
love
a
daya
seems
absurd
but
often
there
s
more
fitness
in
a
thing
than
we
at
once
discern
nor
were
this
time
the
first
when
through
an
unexpected
path
the
saviour
drew
his
children
on
to
him
across
the
tangled
maze
of
human
life
templar
so
solemn
and
yet
if
in
the
stead
of
saviour
i
were
to
say
providence
it
would
sound
true
you
make
me
curious
daya
which
i
m
unwont
to
be
daya
this
is
the
place
for
miracles
templar
for
and
can
it
be
otherwise
where
the
whole
world
presses
as
toward
a
centre
my
dear
daya
consider
what
you
asked
of
me
as
owned
that
i
do
love
i
can
t
imagine
how
i
should
live
without
daya
indeed
then
knight
swear
to
me
you
will
call
her
yours
make
both
her
present
and
eternal
welfare
templar
and
how
how
can
i
can
i
swear
to
do
what
is
not
in
my
power
daya
tis
in
your
power
a
single
word
will
put
it
in
your
power
templar
so
that
her
father
shall
not
be
against
it
daya
her
he
shall
be
compelled
templar
as
yet
he
is
not
fallen
among
compelled
daya
aye
to
be
willing
that
you
should
templar
compelled
and
if
i
inform
thee
that
i
have
tried
to
touch
this
string
already
it
vibrates
not
responsive
daya
he
refused
thee
templar
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
such
discordance
that
i
was
hurt
daya
what
do
you
say
how
you
betrayed
the
shadow
of
a
wish
for
recha
and
he
did
not
spring
up
for
joy
drew
back
drew
coldly
back
made
difficulties
templar
almost
daya
well
then
i
ll
not
deliberate
a
moment
templar
and
yet
you
are
deliberating
still
daya
that
man
was
always
else
so
good
so
kind
i
am
so
deeply
in
his
debt
why
why
would
he
not
listen
to
you
god
s
my
witness
that
my
heart
bleeds
to
come
about
him
thus
templar
i
pray
you
daya
once
for
all
to
end
this
dire
uncertainty
but
if
you
doubt
whether
what
tis
your
purpose
to
reveal
be
right
or
wrong
be
praiseworthy
or
shameful
speak
will
forget
that
you
have
had
something
to
hide
daya
that
spurs
me
on
still
more
then
learn
that
recha
is
no
jewess
that
she
is
a
christian
templar
i
congratulate
you
twas
a
hard
labour
but
tis
out
at
last
the
pangs
of
the
delivery
won
t
hurt
you
go
on
with
undiminished
zeal
and
people
heaven
when
no
longer
fit
to
people
earth
daya
how
knight
does
my
intelligence
deserve
such
bitter
scorn
that
recha
is
a
christian
on
you
a
christian
templar
and
her
lover
confers
no
joy
templar
particularly
as
she
is
a
christian
of
your
making
daya
daya
o
so
you
understand
and
i
wish
to
find
out
him
that
might
convert
her
it
is
her
fate
long
since
to
have
been
that
which
she
is
spoiled
for
being
templar
do
or
go
daya
she
is
a
christian
christian
parents
was
born
and
is
baptised
templar
and
daya
is
not
her
father
templar
nathan
not
her
and
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
daya
i
am
it
is
a
truth
has
cost
me
tears
of
blood
no
he
is
not
her
father
templar
and
has
only
brought
her
up
as
his
daughter
educated
the
christian
child
a
jewess
daya
certainly
templar
and
she
is
unacquainted
with
her
birth
has
never
learnt
from
him
that
she
was
born
a
christian
and
no
jewess
daya
never
yet
templar
and
he
not
only
let
the
child
grow
up
in
this
mistaken
notion
but
still
leaves
the
woman
in
it
daya
aye
alas
templar
how
nathan
the
wise
good
nathan
thus
allow
himself
to
stifle
nature
s
voice
thus
to
misguide
upon
himself
th
effusions
of
a
heart
which
to
itself
abandoned
would
have
formed
another
bias
indeed
you
have
intrusted
an
important
secret
that
may
have
confounds
me
i
can
not
tell
what
i
ve
to
do
at
present
therefore
go
give
me
time
he
may
come
by
and
may
surprise
us
daya
i
should
drop
for
fright
templar
i
am
not
able
now
to
talk
farewell
and
if
you
chance
to
meet
him
only
say
that
we
shall
find
each
other
at
the
sultan
s
daya
let
him
not
see
you
ve
any
grudge
against
him
that
should
be
kept
to
give
the
proper
impulse
to
things
at
last
and
may
remove
your
scruples
respecting
recha
but
then
if
you
take
her
back
with
you
into
europe
let
not
me
be
left
behind
templar
that
we
ll
soon
settle
go
act
iv
cloister
of
a
convent
friar
friar
s
very
patriarch
in
fact
of
all
that
he
has
sent
me
after
not
much
turns
out
his
put
on
me
such
business
and
no
other
i
don
t
care
to
coax
and
wheedle
and
to
run
my
nose
into
all
sorts
of
things
and
have
a
hand
in
all
that
s
going
forward
i
did
not
renounce
the
world
for
my
own
part
in
order
to
be
entangled
with
t
for
other
people
friar
templar
templar
good
brother
are
you
there
i
ve
sought
you
long
friar
me
sir
templar
what
don
t
you
recollect
me
friar
oh
i
thought
i
never
in
my
life
was
likely
to
see
you
any
more
for
so
i
hoped
in
god
i
did
not
vastly
relish
the
proposal
that
i
was
bound
to
make
you
yes
god
knows
how
little
i
desired
to
find
a
hearing
knows
i
was
inly
glad
when
you
refused
without
a
moment
s
thought
what
of
a
knight
would
be
unworthy
are
your
second
templar
so
you
already
know
my
purpose
i
scarce
know
myself
friar
have
you
by
this
reflected
that
our
good
patriarch
is
not
so
much
out
that
gold
and
fame
in
plenty
may
be
got
by
his
commission
that
a
foe
s
a
foe
were
he
our
guardian
angel
seven
times
over
have
you
weighed
this
gainst
flesh
and
blood
and
come
to
strike
the
bargain
he
proposed
ah
god
templar
my
dear
good
man
set
your
poor
heart
at
ease
not
therefore
am
i
come
not
therefore
wish
to
see
the
patriarch
in
person
still
on
the
first
point
i
think
as
i
then
thought
nor
would
i
for
aught
in
the
world
exchange
that
good
opinion
which
i
once
obtained
from
such
a
worthy
upright
man
as
thou
art
i
come
to
ask
your
patriarch
s
friar
round
with
our
patriarch
a
knight
ask
priest
s
advice
templar
mine
is
a
priestly
business
friar
yet
the
priests
ask
not
the
knights
advice
be
their
affair
ever
so
knightly
templar
therefore
one
allows
them
to
overshoot
themselves
a
privilege
which
such
as
i
don
t
vastly
envy
them
indeed
if
i
were
acting
for
myself
had
not
t
account
with
others
i
should
care
but
little
for
his
counsel
but
some
things
i
d
rather
do
amiss
by
others
guidance
than
by
my
own
aright
and
then
by
this
time
i
see
religion
too
is
party
and
he
who
believes
himself
the
most
impartial
does
but
uphold
the
standard
of
his
own
howe
er
unconsciously
and
since
tis
so
so
must
be
well
friar
i
rather
shall
not
answer
for
i
don
t
understand
exactly
templar
yet
let
me
consider
what
it
is
precisely
that
i
have
need
of
counsel
or
decision
simple
or
learned
you
brother
i
thank
you
for
your
be
thou
my
patriarch
for
tis
the
plain
christian
whom
in
the
patriarch
i
have
to
consult
and
not
the
patriarch
in
the
christian
friar
oh
i
beg
no
must
quite
mistake
me
he
that
knows
much
hath
learnt
much
care
and
i
devoted
me
to
only
one
tis
well
most
luckily
here
comes
the
very
man
wait
here
stand
has
perceived
you
knight
templar
i
d
rather
shun
him
he
is
not
my
man
a
thick
red
smiling
as
friar
but
you
should
see
him
on
a
he
only
comes
from
visiting
the
sick
templar
great
saladin
must
then
be
put
to
shame
marching
up
one
of
the
aisles
in
great
makes
signs
to
the
approaches
patriarch
friar
templar
patriarch
that
the
templar
what
wants
he
friar
i
know
not
patriarch
the
the
friar
and
the
rest
of
his
train
draw
so
sir
knight
i
m
truly
happy
to
meet
the
brave
young
very
young
something
god
helping
may
come
of
him
templar
more
than
is
already
hardly
will
come
of
him
but
less
my
reverend
father
that
may
chance
patriarch
it
is
my
prayer
at
least
a
knight
so
pious
may
for
the
cause
of
christendom
and
god
long
be
preserved
nor
can
that
fail
so
be
young
valour
will
lend
ear
to
aged
counsel
with
what
can
i
be
useful
any
way
templar
with
that
which
my
youth
is
without
with
counsel
patriarch
most
willingly
but
counsel
should
be
followed
templar
surely
not
blindly
patriarch
who
says
that
indeed
none
should
omit
to
make
use
of
the
reason
given
him
by
god
in
things
where
it
belongs
but
it
belongs
not
everywhere
for
instance
if
god
by
some
one
of
his
blessed
angels
or
other
holy
minister
of
his
word
deign
d
to
make
known
a
mean
by
which
the
welfare
of
christendom
or
of
his
holy
church
in
some
peculiar
and
especial
manner
might
be
promoted
or
secured
who
then
shall
venture
to
rise
up
and
try
by
reason
the
will
of
him
who
has
created
reason
measure
th
eternal
laws
of
heaven
by
the
little
rules
of
a
vain
human
honour
but
of
all
this
enough
what
is
it
then
on
which
our
counsel
is
desired
templar
suppose
my
reverend
father
that
a
jew
possessed
an
only
child
a
girl
we
ll
say
whom
he
with
fond
attention
forms
to
every
virtue
and
loves
more
than
his
very
soul
a
child
who
by
her
pious
love
requites
his
goodness
and
now
suppose
it
to
this
girl
is
not
the
daughter
of
the
jew
he
picked
up
purchased
stole
her
in
her
that
she
was
born
of
christians
and
baptised
but
that
the
jew
hath
reared
her
as
a
jewess
allows
her
to
remain
a
jewess
and
to
think
herself
his
daughter
reverend
father
what
then
ought
to
be
done
patriarch
i
shudder
but
first
will
you
please
explain
if
such
a
case
be
fact
or
only
an
hypothesis
that
is
to
say
if
you
of
your
own
head
invent
the
case
or
if
indeed
it
happened
and
still
continues
happening
templar
i
had
thought
that
just
to
learn
your
reverence
s
opinion
this
were
all
one
patriarch
all
see
how
apt
proud
human
reason
is
in
spiritual
things
to
err
tis
not
all
one
for
if
the
point
in
question
be
a
mere
sport
of
the
wit
twill
not
be
worth
our
while
to
think
it
through
but
i
should
recommend
the
curious
person
to
theatres
where
oft
with
loud
applause
such
pro
and
contras
have
been
agitated
but
if
the
object
should
be
something
more
than
by
a
a
sleight
of
logic
to
get
the
better
of
the
case
be
really
extant
if
it
should
have
happened
within
our
diocese
perhaps
here
in
our
dear
jerusalem
itself
why
templar
what
then
patriarch
then
were
it
proper
to
execute
at
once
upon
the
jew
the
penal
laws
in
such
a
case
provided
by
papal
and
imperial
right
against
so
foul
a
dire
abomination
templar
so
patriarch
and
the
laws
forementioned
have
decreed
that
if
a
jew
shall
to
apostacy
seduce
a
christian
he
shall
die
by
fire
templar
so
patriarch
how
much
more
the
jew
who
forcibly
tears
from
the
holy
font
a
christian
child
and
breaks
the
sacramental
bond
of
baptism
for
all
what
s
done
to
children
is
by
i
mean
except
what
the
church
does
to
children
templar
what
if
the
child
but
for
this
fostering
jew
must
have
expired
in
misery
patriarch
that
s
nothing
the
jew
has
still
deserved
the
twere
better
it
here
died
in
misery
than
for
eternal
woe
to
live
besides
why
should
the
jew
forestall
the
hand
of
god
god
if
he
wills
to
save
can
save
without
him
templar
and
spite
of
him
too
save
eternally
patriarch
that
s
nothing
still
the
jew
is
to
be
burnt
templar
that
hurts
particularly
as
tis
said
he
has
not
so
much
taught
the
maid
his
faith
as
brought
her
up
with
the
mere
knowledge
of
what
our
reason
teaches
about
god
patriarch
that
s
nothing
still
the
jew
is
to
be
and
for
this
very
reason
would
deserve
to
be
thrice
burnt
how
let
a
child
grow
up
without
a
faith
not
even
teach
a
child
the
greatest
of
its
duties
to
believe
tis
heinous
i
am
quite
astonished
knight
that
you
templar
the
rest
right
reverend
sir
in
the
confessional
but
not
before
to
patriarch
what
stay
for
my
not
name
to
me
this
infidel
this
not
find
him
up
for
me
at
once
but
hold
a
thought
occurs
i
ll
straightway
to
the
sultan
conformably
to
the
capitulation
which
saladin
has
sworn
he
must
support
us
in
all
the
privileges
all
the
doctrines
which
appertain
to
our
most
holy
faith
thank
god
we
ve
the
original
in
keeping
we
have
his
hand
and
seal
to
and
i
shall
lead
him
easily
to
think
how
very
dangerous
for
the
state
it
is
not
to
believe
all
civic
bonds
divide
like
flax
where
subjects
don
t
believe
away
with
foul
impiety
templar
it
happens
somewhat
unlucky
that
i
want
the
leisure
to
enjoy
this
holy
sermon
i
am
sent
for
to
saladin
patriarch
why
templar
and
will
prepare
the
sultan
if
agreeable
for
your
right
reverend
visit
patriarch
i
have
heard
that
you
found
favour
in
the
sultan
s
sight
i
beg
with
all
humility
to
be
remembered
to
him
i
am
purely
motived
by
zeal
in
th
cause
of
god
what
of
too
much
i
do
i
do
for
that
in
goodness
twas
then
most
noble
you
were
starting
about
the
problem
merely

whose
foundation
i

number
of
purses
and
pile
them
on
the
saladin
saladin
in
troth
this
has
no
end
and
is
there
much
of
this
same
thing
behind
slave
about
one
half
saladin
then
take
the
rest
to
sittah
where

what

here
shall
take
charge
of
straight
or
shan
t
i
rather
send
it
to
my
father
here
it
slips
through
one
s
fingers
sure
in
time
one
may
grow
callous
it
shall
now
cost
labour
to
come
at
much
from

until
the
treasures
come
from

poverty

nathan
and
the
templar
not
yet
come

he
has
been
seeking
for
him
look
what
i
met
with
when
the
plate
and
jewels
were
passing
through
my
a
small
saladin
ha
what
my
brother
tis
he
tis
he
he
he
alas
thou
dear
brave
youth
and
lost
to
me
so
early
what
would
i
not
with
thee
and
at
thy
side
have
undertaken
let
me
have
the
portrait
i
recollect
it
now
again
he
gave
it
unto
thy
elder
sister
to
his
lilah
that
morning
that
she
would
not
part
with
him
but
clasped
him
so
in
tears
it
was
the
last
morning
that
he
rode
out
and
let
him
ride
unattended
lilah
died
for
grief
and
never
could
forgive
me
that
i
let
him
then
ride
alone
he
came
not
back
sittah
poor
saladin
time
shall
be
when
none
of
us
will
come
back
and
then
who
knows
it
is
not
death
alone
that
balks
the
hopes
of
young
men
of
his
cast
such
have
far
other
foes
and
oftentimes
the
strongest
like
the
weakest
is
o
ercome
be
as
it
must
compare
this
picture
with
our
young
templar
to
observe
how
much
my
fancy
cheated
me
sittah
i
therefore
brought
it
but
give
it
me
i
ll
tell
thee
if
tis
like
we
women
see
that
best
saladin
a
slave
at
the
ah
who
is
there
the
templar
let
him
come
sittah
herself
on
a
sofa
apart
and
drops
her
not
to
interfere
or
with
my
curiosity
disturb
you
saladin
that
s
right
and
then
his
voice
will
that
be
like
the
tone
of
assad
s
voice
sleeps
somewhere
templar
saladin
templar
i
thy
prisoner
sultan
saladin
thou
my
and
shall
i
not
to
him
whose
life
i
gave
also
give
freedom
templar
what
twere
worthy
thine
to
do
it
is
my
part
to
hear
of
thee
and
not
to
take
for
granted
but
o
sultan
to
lay
loud
protestations
at
thy
feet
of
gratitude
for
a
life
spared
agrees
not
with
my
station
or
my
character
at
all
times
tis
once
more
prince
at
thy
service
saladin
only
forbear
to
use
it
against
me
not
that
i
grudge
my
enemy
one
pair
more
of
such
a
heart
it
goes
against
me
to
yield
him
i
have
been
deceived
with
thee
thou
brave
young
man
in
nothing
yes
thou
art
in
soul
and
body
assad
i
could
ask
thee
where
then
hast
thou
been
lurking
all
this
time
or
in
what
cavern
slept
what
ginnistan
chose
some
kind
perie
for
thy
that
she
might
ever
keep
the
flower
thus
fresh
methinks
i
could
remind
thee
here
and
yonder
of
what
we
did
abuse
thee
for
having
had
one
secret
e
en
to
cheat
me
of
one
i
could
if
i
saw
thee
alone
and
not
myself
thanks
that
so
much
of
this
fond
sweet
illusion
at
least
is
true
that
in
my
sear
of
life
an
assad
blossoms
for
me
thou
art
willing
templar
all
that
from
thee
comes
to
me
whatsoever
it
chance
to
prove
lies
as
a
wish
already
within
my
soul
saladin
we
ll
try
the
experiment
wilt
thou
stay
with
me
dwell
about
me
boots
not
as
mussulman
or
christian
in
a
turban
or
a
white
have
never
wished
to
see
the
same
bark
grow
about
all
trees
templar
else
saladin
thou
hardly
hadst
become
the
hero
that
thou
art
alike
to
all
the
gardener
of
the
lord
saladin
if
thou
think
not
the
worse
of
me
for
this
we
re
half
right
templar
quite
so
one
word
saladin
out
his
templar
one
with
this
receive
more
than
thou
canst
take
away
wholly
saladin
tis
for
one
day
too
great
a
great
came
he
not
with
thee
templar
who
saladin
who
nathan
templar
no
i
came
alone
saladin
o
what
a
deed
of
thine
and
what
a
happiness
a
blessing
to
thee
that
such
a
deed
was
serving
such
a
man
templar
yes
yes
saladin
so
my
young
god
does
through
our
means
a
service
we
ought
not
to
be
so
cold
not
out
of
modesty
wish
to
appear
so
cold
templar
in
this
same
world
all
things
have
many
sides
and
tis
not
easy
to
comprehend
how
they
can
fit
each
other
saladin
cling
ever
to
the
praise
to
god
who
knows
how
they
can
fit
but
my
young
man
if
thou
wilt
be
so
difficult
i
must
be
very
cautious
with
thee
for
i
too
have
many
sides
and
some
of
them
perhaps
such
as
mayn
t
always
seem
to
fit
templar
that
wounds
me
suspicion
usually
is
not
my
failing
saladin
say
then
of
whom
thou
harbour
st
it
of
nathan
so
should
thy
talk
thou
suspect
him
give
me
the
first
proof
of
thy
confidence
templar
i
ve
nothing
against
nathan
i
am
angry
with
myself
only
saladin
and
for
what
templar
for
dreaming
that
any
jew
could
learn
to
be
no
for
dreaming
it
awake
saladin
out
with
this
dream
templar
thou
know
st
of
nathan
s
daughter
sultan
what
i
did
for
her
i
i
did
it
too
proud
to
reap
thanks
which
i
had
not
sown
for
i
shunned
from
day
to
day
her
very
sight
the
father
was
far
off
he
comes
he
hears
he
seeks
me
thanks
me
wishes
that
his
daughter
may
please
me
talks
to
me
of
dawning
i
listen
to
his
prate
go
see
and
find
a
girl
indeed
o
sultan
i
am
saladin
a
shamed
that
a
jew
girl
knew
how
to
make
impression
on
thee
surely
not
templar
but
that
to
this
impression
my
rash
yielding
heart
trusting
the
smoothness
of
the
father
s
prate
opposed
no
more
resistance
sprang
a
second
time
into
the
flame
and
then
i
wooed
and
was
denied
saladin
denied
denied
templar
the
prudent
father
does
not
flatly
say
no
to
my
wishes
but
the
prudent
father
must
first
inquire
and
look
about
and
think
oh
by
all
means
did
not
i
do
the
same
did
not
i
look
about
and
ask
who
twas
while
she
was
shrieking
in
the
flame
indeed
by
god
tis
something
beautifully
wise
to
be
so
circumspect
saladin
come
come
forgive
something
to
age
his
lingerings
can
not
last
he
is
not
going
to
require
of
thee
first
to
turn
jew
templar
who
knows
saladin
who
i
who
know
this
nathan
better
templar
yet
the
superstition
in
which
we
have
grown
up
not
therefore
loses
when
we
detect
it
all
its
influence
on
us
not
all
are
free
that
can
bemock
their
fetters
saladin
maturely
nathan
surely
templar
the
worst
of
superstitions
is
to
think
one
s
own
most
bearable
saladin
may
be
but
templar
must
nathan
be
the
mortal
who
unshrinking
can
face
the
ray
of
truth
nor
there
betray
the
twilight
dungeon
which
he
crawled
from
saladin
yes
nathan
is
that
man
templar
i
thought
so
too
but
what
if
this
picked
man
this
chosen
sage
were
such
a
thorough
jew
that
he
seeks
out
for
christian
children
to
bring
up
as
how
then
saladin
who
says
this
of
him
templar
e
en
the
maid
with
whom
he
frets
the
hope
of
whom
he
seemed
to
joy
in
paying
me
the
service
which
he
would
not
allow
me
to
do
this
very
maid
is
not
his
she
is
a
kidnapped
christian
child
saladin
whom
he
has
notwithstanding
to
thy
wish
refused
templar
refused
or
not
i
know
him
now
there
lies
the
prating
tolerationist
and
i
ll
halloo
upon
this
jewish
wolf
for
all
his
philosophical
sheep
s
clothing
dogs
that
shall
touze
his
hide
saladin
peace
christian
templar
what
peace
may
jew
and
mussulman
stickle
for
being
jew
and
mussulman
and
must
the
christian
only
drop
the
christian
saladin
peace
christian
templar
yes
i
feel
what
weight
of
blame
lies
in
that
word
of
thine
pent
up
o
that
i
knew
how
assad
in
my
place
would
act
saladin
much
better
probably
as
fiery
who
has
already
taught
thee
thus
at
once
like
him
to
bribe
me
with
a
single
word
indeed
if
all
has
past
as
thou
narratest
i
scarcely
can
discover
nathan
in
it
but
nathan
is
my
friend
and
of
my
friends
one
must
not
bicker
with
the
other
and
be
directed
move
with
caution
do
not
loose
on
him
the
fanatics
of
thy
sect
conceal
what
all
thy
clergy
would
be
claiming
my
hand
to
avenge
upon
him
with
more
show
of
right
than
is
my
wish
be
not
from
spite
to
any
jew
or
mussulman
a
christian
templar
thy
counsel
is
but
on
the
brink
of
coming
somewhat
too
late
thanks
to
the
patriarch
s
bloodthirsty
rage
whose
instrument
i
shudder
to
have
almost
become
saladin
how
how
thou
wentest
still
earlier
to
the
patriarch
than
to
me
templar
yes
in
the
storm
of
passion
in
the
eddy
of
thou
wilt
no
longer
care
i
fear
to
find
in
me
one
feature
of
thy
assad
saladin
yes
that
fear
methinks
i
know
by
this
time
from
what
failings
our
virtue
do
thou
cultivate
those
shall
but
little
harm
thee
in
my
sight
but
go
seek
nathan
as
he
sought
for
thee
and
bring
him
hither
i
must
reconcile
you
if
thou
art
serious
about
the
be
calm
she
shall
be
shall
feel
that
without
swine
s
flesh
one
may
educate
a
christian
child
go
sittah
from
the
very
strange
indeed
saladin
well
sittah
must
my
assad
not
have
been
a
gallant
handsome
youth
sittah
if
he
was
thus
and
twasn
t
the
templar
who
sat
to
the
painter
but
how
couldst
thou
be
so
forgetful
brother
as
not
to
ask
about
his
parents
saladin
and
particularly
too
about
his
mother
whether
his
mother
e
er
was
in
this
country
that
is
your
meaning
isn
t
it
sittah
you
run
saladin
oh
nothing
is
more
possible
for
assad
mong
handsome
christian
ladies
was
so
welcome
to
handsome
christian
ladies
so
attached
that
once
a
report
tis
not
pleasant
to
bring
that
up
let
us
be
satisfied
that
we
have
got
him
once
got
him
with
all
the
faults
and
freaks
the
starts
and
wildness
of
his
warm
gentle
nathan
must
give
him
the
think
so
sittah
up
saladin
aye
for
what
right
has
nathan
with
the
girl
if
he
be
not
her
father
he
who
saved
her
life
so
lately
has
a
stronger
claim
to
heir
their
rights
who
gave
it
her
at
first
sittah
what
therefore
saladin
if
you
withdraw
the
maid
at
once
from
the
unrightful
owner
saladin
there
is
no
need
of
that
sittah
need
not
precisely
but
female
curiosity
inspires
me
with
that
counsel
there
are
certain
men
of
whom
one
is
irresistibly
impatient
to
know
what
women
they
can
be
in
love
with
saladin
well
then
you
may
send
for
her
sittah
may
i
brother
saladin
but
hurt
not
nathan
he
must
not
imagine
that
we
propose
by
violence
to
part
them
sittah
be
without
apprehension
saladin
fare
you
well
i
must
make
out
where
this
is
hall
in
nathan
s
house
as
in
the
first
scene
the
things
there
mentioned
unpacked
and
displayed

o
how
magnificent
how
tasty
all
such
as
only
you
could

was
this
thin
silver

gold
woven
what
might
it
cost
yes
this
is
worthy
to
be
a
not
a
queen
could
wish
a
handsomer
nathan
why
daya
perhaps
of
that
you
thought
not
when
you
bought
it
but
nathan
it
must
be
so

indeed
it
seems
made
for
a
pure
white
ground
emblem
of
branching
gold
emblem
of

not
it
delightful
nathan
what

all
this
ingenuity
of

end
daya
there
do
not
act
so
strange
you
must
perceive
the
templar
loves
your
her
to
him
then
will
your
sin
which
i
can
hide
no
longer
be
at
an
end
the
maid
will
come
once
more
among
the
christians
will
be
once
again
what

was
born
to

be
what
she
was

tell
how
to
come
at
the
templar
not
betraying
the
motive
of
my
for
if
i
tell
it
and
if
my
suspicion
be
groundless
i
have
staked
the
father
idly
what
is
the
matter
daya
he
must
speak
to
you
nathan
then
let
him
come
to
me
go
you
meanwhile
how
gladly
would

still
remain
my
recha

father
and
can
i
not
remain
so
though
i
cease
to
wear
the
name
to

to
her
i
still
shall
wear
it
when
she
once
perceives
how
willingly

pious

can
be
done
to
serve
you

friar
friar
o
not

and

i
do
rejoice
to
see
you
yet
so
well
nathan
you
know
me
friar
who
knows
you
not
you
have
impressed
your
name
in
many
a
hand
and
it
has
been
in
mine
these
many
years
nathan
for
his
here
brother
i
ll
refresh
it
friar
thank
you
thank
from
poorer
men
i
d
nothing
now
only
allow
me
to
refresh
my
name
in
your
remembrance
for
i
too
may
boast
to
have
of
old
put
something
in
your
hand
not
to
be
scorned
nathan
excuse
me
i
m
ashamed
what
was
it
claim
it
of
me
sevenfold
i
m
ready
to
atone
for
my
forgetting
friar
but
before
all
hear
how
this
very
day
i
was
reminded
of
the
pledge
i
brought
you
nathan
a
pledge
to
me
intrusted
friar
some
time
since
i
dwelt
as
hermit
on
the
quarantana
not
far
from
jericho
but
arab
robbers
came
and
broke
up
my
cell
and
oratory
and
dragged
me
with
them
fortunately
i
escaped
and
with
the
patriarch
sought
a
refuge
to
beg
of
him
some
other
still
retreat
where
i
may
serve
my
god
in
solitude
until
my
latter
end
nathan
i
stand
on
quick
my
good
brother
let
me
know
what
pledge
you
once
intrusted
to
me
friar
presently
good
nathan
presently
the
patriarch
has
promised
me
a
hermitage
on
thabor
as
soon
as
one
is
vacant
and
meanwhile
employs
me
as
in
the
convent
and
there
i
am
at
present
and
i
pine
a
hundred
times
a
day
for
thabor
for
the
patriarch
will
set
me
about
all
work
and
some
that
i
can
t
for
nathan
be
speedy
i
beseech
you
friar
now
it
happens
that
some
one
whispered
in
his
ear
there
lives
hard
by
a
jew
who
educates
a
christian
child
as
his
own
daughter
nathan
how
friar
hear
me
quite
out
so
he
commissions
me
if
possible
to
track
him
out
this
jew
and
stormed
most
bitterly
at
the
misdeed
which
seems
to
him
to
be
the
very
sin
against
the
holy
is
the
sin
of
all
most
unforgiven
most
enormous
but
luckily
we
can
not
tell
exactly
what
it
consists
at
once
my
conscience
was
roused
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
perhaps
had
given
occasion
to
this
sin
now
do
not
you
remember
a
knight
s
squire
who
eighteen
years
ago
gave
to
your
hands
a
female
child
a
few
weeks
old
nathan
how
that
in
fact
such
friar
now
look
with
heed
at
me
and
recollect
i
was
the
man
on
horseback
who
brought
the
child
nathan
was
you
friar
and
he
from
whom
i
brought
it
was
methinks
a
lord
of
leonard
of
filnek
nathan
right
friar
because
the
mother
died
a
short
time
before
and
he
the
father
had
on
a
sudden
to
make
off
to
gazza
where
the
poor
helpless
thing
could
not
go
with
him
therefore
he
sent
it
was
my
message
did
not
i
find
you
out
at
darun
there
consign
it
to
you
nathan
yes
friar
it
were
no
wonder
my
memory
deceived
me
i
have
had
many
a
worthy
master
and
this
one
i
served
not
long
he
fell
at
but
he
was
a
kind
lord
nathan
o
yes
indeed
for
much
have
i
to
thank
him
very
he
more
than
once
preserved
me
from
the
sword
friar
o
therefore
will
with
double
pleasure
have
taken
up
this
daughter
nathan
you
have
said
it
friar
where
is
she
then
she
is
not
dead
i
i
would
not
have
her
dead
dear
pretty
creature
if
no
one
else
know
anything
about
it
all
is
yet
safe
nathan
aye
all
friar
yes
trust
me
nathan
this
is
my
way
of
the
good
that
i
propose
to
do
is
somehow
twined
with
mischief
then
i
let
the
good
alone
for
we
know
pretty
well
what
mischief
is
but
not
what
s
for
the
best
twas
natural
if
you
meant
to
bring
up
the
christian
child
right
well
that
you
should
rear
it
as
your
own
and
to
have
done
this
lovingly
and
truly
for
such
a
horrible
it
might
have
been
more
prudent
to
have
had
it
brought
up
at
second
hand
by
some
good
christian
in
her
own
faith
but
your
friend
s
orphan
child
you
would
not
then
have
loved
children
need
love
were
it
the
mute
affection
of
a
brute
more
at
that
age
than
christianity
there
s
always
time
enough
for
if
the
maid
have
but
grown
up
before
your
eyes
with
a
sound
frame
and
remains
still
in
her
maker
s
eye
the
same
for
is
not
christianity
all
built
on
judaism
oh
it
has
often
vexed
me
cost
me
tears
that
christians
will
forget
so
often
that
our
saviour
was
a
jew
nathan
you
my
good
brother
shall
be
my
advocate
when
bigot
hate
and
hard
hypocrisy
shall
rise
upon
and
for
a
thou
shalt
know
but
take
it
with
thee
to
the
tomb
as
yet
has
vanity
ne
er
tempted
me
to
tell
it
to
living
to
thee
i
tell
it
to
simple
piety
alone
for
it
alone
can
feel
what
deeds
the
man
who
trusts
in
god
can
gain
upon
himself
friar
you
seem
affected
and
your
swim
in
water
nathan
twas
at
darun
you
met
me
with
the
child
but
you
will
not
have
known
that
a
few
days
before
the
christians
murdered
every
jew
in
gath
woman
and
child
that
among
these
my
wife
with
seven
hopeful
sons
were
found
who
all
beneath
my
brother
s
roof
which
they
had
fled
to
were
burnt
alive
friar
just
god
nathan
and
when
you
came
three
nights
had
i
in
dust
and
ashes
lain
before
my
god
and
and
at
times
arraigned
my
maker
raged
and
cursed
myself
and
the
whole
world
and
to
christianity
swore
unrelenting
hate
friar
ah
i
believe
you
nathan
but
by
degrees
returning
reason
came
she
spake
with
gentle
yet
god
is
and
this
was
his
exercise
what
thou
hast
long
imagined
and
what
surely
is
not
more
difficult
to
exercise
than
to
thou
will
it
once
i
rose
and
called
i
will
so
thou
but
aid
my
behold
you
was
just
then
dismounted
and
presented
to
me
the
child
wrapt
in
your
mantle
what
you
said
or
i
occurs
not
to
me
thus
much
i
took
the
child
i
bore
it
to
my
couch
i
kissed
it
flung
myself
upon
my
knees
and
god
now
have
i
one
out
of
the
seven
again
friar
nathan
you
are
a
christian
yes
by
god
you
are
a
was
a
better
nathan
heaven
bless
us
what
makes
me
to
you
a
christian
makes
you
to
me
a
jew
but
let
us
cease
to
melt
each
is
nigh
to
act
and
though
a
sevenfold
love
had
bound
me
soon
to
this
strange
only
girl
though
the
mere
thought
that
i
shall
lose
in
her
my
seven
sons
a
second
time
distracts
i
will
if
providence
require
her
at
my
hands
obey
friar
the
very
thing
i
should
advise
you
but
your
good
genius
has
forestalled
my
thought
nathan
the
first
best
claimant
must
not
seek
to
tear
her
from
me
friar
no
most
surely
not
nathan
and
he
that
has
not
stronger
claims
than
i
at
least
ought
to
have
earlier
friar
certainly
nathan
by
nature
and
blood
conferred
friar
i
mean
so
too
nathan
then
name
the
man
allied
to
her
as
brother
uncle
or
otherwise
akin
and
i
from
him
will
not
withhold
who
was
created
and
was
brought
up
to
be
of
any
house
of
any
faith
the
i
hope
that
of
your
master
and
his
race
you
knew
more
than
myself
friar
i
hardly
think
that
nathan
for
i
already
told
you
that
i
passed
a
short
time
with
him
nathan
can
you
tell
at
least
the
mother
s
family
name
she
was
i
think
a
stauffen
friar
may
in
fact
you
re
right
nathan
conrade
of
stauffen
was
her
brother
s
he
was
a
templar
friar
i
am
clear
it
was
but
stay
i
recollect
i
ve
yet
a
book
twas
my
dead
lord
drew
it
from
his
bosom
while
we
were
burying
him
at
askalon
nathan
well
friar
there
are
prayers
in
t
tis
what
we
call
a
breviary
this
thought
i
may
yet
serve
some
christian
me
indeed
for
i
can
t
read
nathan
no
matter
to
the
thing
friar
this
book
is
written
at
both
ends
quite
full
and
as
i
m
told
contains
in
his
about
both
him
and
her
what
s
most
material
nathan
go
run
and
fetch
the
tis
fortunate
i
am
ready
with
its
weight
in
gold
to
pay
it
and
thousand
thanks
run
friar
most
gladly
but
tis
in
arabic
what
he
has
written
nathan
no
s
all
fetch
if
by
its
means
i
may
retain
the
daughter
and
purchase
with
it
such
a
but
that
s
chance
as
it
may
who
now
can
have
been
with
the
patriarch
to
tell
this
tale
that
i
must
not
forget
to
ask
about
if
t
were
of
daya
s
nathan
daya
daya
breaks
nathan
nathan
well
daya
only
think
she
was
quite
frightened
at
it
poor
child
a
nathan
from
the
patriarch
daya
the
sultan
s
sister
princess
sittah
sends
nathan
and
not
the
patriarch
daya
can
t
you
hear
the
princess
has
sent
to
see
your
recha
nathan
sent
for
recha
has
sittah
sent
for
recha
well
if
sittah
and
not
the
patriarch
sends
daya
why
think
of
him
nathan
have
you
heard
nothing
from
him
seen
nothing
of
nothing
to
him
daya
how
i
to
him
nathan
where
are
the
messengers
daya
there
just
before
you
nathan
i
will
talk
with
them
out
of
precaution
if
there
s
nothing
lurking
beneath
this
message
of
the
patriarch
s
daya
and
ve
other
fears
the
only
daughter
as
they
suppose
of
such
a
rich
rich
jew
would
for
a
mussulman
be
no
bad
thing
i
bet
the
templar
will
be
choused
unless
i
risk
the
second
step
and
to
herself
discover
who
she
is
let
me
for
this
employ
the
first
short
moments
we
re
alone
and
that
will
as
i
am
going
with
her
a
serious
hint
upon
the
road
i
think
can
t
be
now
or
act

in
the

in
a
pile

saladin
he
comes
here
lies
the

still
and
no
one
finds
the
dervis

probably
got
somewhere
over
a

would
often
make
the

forget
himself
and
why
not

what

the
matter
saladin

ibrahim

when
their

smiles
i
the
telling
the
sender
s
hire
by
the

bounty
is
oft
outweighed
am
i
to
be
the
first
whom
saladin
at
length
has
learnt
to
pay
in
words
the
first
about
whose
recompense
the
sultan
higgled

go
pick
up
a

ibrahim
no

give
them
all
away
saladin
man
here
come
hither
take
these
and
is
he
really
he
conquer
me
then
in
generosity
for
surely
tis
harder
for
this
fellow
to
refuse
than
tis
for
me
to
give
here
shall
i
be
tempted
just
before
my
exit
to
be
a
different
saladin
not
die
like
saladin
then
wherefore
live
so
abdallah
saladin
abdallah
hail
sultan
saladin
if
thou
comest
to
inform
me
that
the
whole
convoy
is
arrived
from
egypt
i
know
it
already
abdallah
do
i
come
too
late
saladin
too
late
and
why
too
late
there
for
thy
tidings
pick
up
a
purse
or
two
abdallah
does
that
make
three
saladin
so
thou
wouldst
well
take
them
take
them
abdallah
a
third
will
yet
be
here
if
he
be
able
saladin
how
so
abdallah
he
may
perhaps
have
broke
his
neck
we
three
as
soon
as
certain
of
the
coming
of
the
rich
caravan
each
crossed
our
horses
and
galloped
hitherward
the
foremost
fell
then
i
was
foremost
and
continued
so
into
the
city
but
sly
ibrahim
who
knows
the
saladin
but
he
that
fell
go
seek
him
abdallah
that
will
i
he
lives
the
half
of
what
i
ve
got
is
his
saladin
what
a
fine
fellow
and
who
can
boast
such
mamalukes
as
these
and
is
it
not
allowed
me
to
imagine
that
my
example
helped
to
form
them
hence
with
the
vile
thought
at
last
to
turn
another
courier
saladin
was
t
thou
who
fell
courier
no
i
ve
to
tell
thee
that
emir
mansor
who
conducts
the
convoy
alights
saladin
o
bring
him
to
he
s
be
welcome
emir
what
has
happened
to
thee
for
we
have
long
expected
thee
saladin
emir
emir
the
wont
this
letter
will
show
that
in
thebais
discontents
required
thy
abulkassem

sabred
hand
ere
we
could
march
since
that
our
progress
sultan
my
zeal
has
sped
most
anxiously
saladin
i
trust
but
my
good
mansor
take
without
thou
art
not
loth
to
go
protection
and
with
the
treasure
on
to
libanon
the
greater
part
at
least
i
have
to
lodge
with
my
old
father
emir
o
most
willingly
saladin
and
take
not
a
slight
escort
libanon
is
far
from
quiet
as
thou
wilt
have
heard
the
templars
stir
afresh
be
therefore
cautious
come
i
must
see
thy
troop
and
give
the
orders
a
say
i
shall
be
with
sittah
when
i
ve
finished
place
of
palms
templar
to
and
templar
into
this
house
i
go
at
last
he
ll
show
once
they
used
to
see
me
so
instantly
so
will
come
when
he
ll
send
out
most
civilly
to
beg
me
not
to
pace
up
and
down
before
his
door
yet
i
m
a
little
nettled
too
and
what
has
thus
embittered
me
against
him
he
answered
yes
he
has
refused
me
nothing
as
yet
and
saladin
has
undertaken
to
bring
him
round
and
does
the
christian
nestle
deeper
in
me
than
the
jew
lurks
in
him
who
who
can
justly
estimate
himself
how
comes
it
else
that
i
should
grudge
him
so
the
little
booty
that
he
took
such
pains
to
rob
the
christians
of
a
theft
no
less
than
such
a
creature
tho
whose
whose
creature
sure
not
the
slave
s
who
floated
the
mere
block
on
to
life
s
barren
strand
and
then
ran
off
but
his
the
artist
s
whose
fine
fancy
moulded
upon
the
unowned
block
a
godlike
form
whose
chisel
graved
it
there
recha
s
true
father
spite
of
the
christian
who
begot
her
is
must
ever
be
the
jew
alas
were
i
to
fancy
her
a
simple
christian
wench
and
without
all
that
which
the
jew
has
given
which
only
such
a
jew
could
have
speak
out
my
heart
what
had
she
that
would
please
thee
no
nothing
little
for
her
very
smile
shrinks
to
a
pretty
twisting
of
the
be
that
which
makes
her
smile
supposed
unworthy
of
all
the
charms
in
ambush
on
her
lips
no
not
her
very
ve
seen
sweet
smiles
spent
on
conceit
on
foppery
on
slander
on
flatterers
on
wicked
wooers
spent
and
did
they
charm
me
then
then
wake
the
wish
to
flutter
out
a
life
beneath
their
sunshine
indeed
i
m
angry
with
the
man
who
alone
gave
this
higher
value
to
her
how
this
and
why
do
i
deserve
the
taunt
with
which
i
was
dismissed
by
saladin
tis
bad
enough
that
saladin
should
think
so
how
little
how
contemptible
must
i
then
have
appeared
to
for
a
girl
conrade
this
will
not
if
daya
to
boot
had
prated
matter
to
me
not
easy
to
be
last
he
s
coming
engaged
in
earnest
with
whom
my
friar
in
nathan
s
house
then
he
knows
perhaps
has
to
the
patriarch
been
betrayed
o
conrade
what
vile
mischiefs
thou
hast
brooded
out
of
thy
head
that
thus
one
spark
of
that
same
passion
love
can
set
so
much
o
th
brain
in
flame
quick
then
determine
wretch
what
shalt
thou
say
or
do
step
back
a
moment
and
see
if
this
good
friar
will
please
to
quit
him
nathan
friar
together
out
of
nathan
s
nathan
once
more
good
brother
thanks
friar
the
like
to
you
nathan
to
me
and
why
because
i
m
would
force
upon
you
what
you
have
no
use
for
friar
the
book
besides
was
none
of
mine
indeed
it
must
at
any
rate
belong
to
th
daughter
it
is
her
whole
her
only
save
she
has
you
god
grant
you
ne
er
have
reason
to
sorrow
for
the
much
you
ve
done
for
her
nathan
how
should
i
that
can
never
be
fear
nothing
friar
patriarchs
and
nathan
have
not
in
their
power
evil
enough
to
make
me
e
er
repent
and
are
you
really
well
assured
it
is
a
templar
who
eggs
on
your
patriarch
friar
it
scarcely
can
be
other
for
a
templar
talked
with
him
just
before
and
what
i
heard
agreed
with
this
nathan
but
there
is
only
one
now
in
jerusalem
and
him
i
know
he
is
my
friend
a
noble
open
youth
friar
the
same
but
what
one
is
at
heart
and
what
one
gets
to
be
in
active
life
mayn
t
always
square
well
together
nathan
no
alas
they
do
not
therefore
unangered
i
let
others
do
their
best
or
worst
o
brother
with
your
book
i
set
all
at
defiance
and
am
going
straight
with
it
to
the
sultan
friar
god
be
with
you
here
i
shall
take
my
leave
nathan
and
have
not
seen
come
soon
come
often
to
us
if
the
patriarch
make
out
no
matter
tell
him
it
all
or
when
you
will
friar
not
nathan
do
not
forget
us
brother
my
god
why
may
i
not
beneath
thy
sky
here
drop
upon
my
knees
now
the
twined
knot
which
has
so
often
made
my
thinkings
anxious
untangles
of
how
i
am
eased
now
that
i
ve
nothing
in
the
world
remaining
that
i
need
that
i
can
as
freely
walk
before
man
as
before
thee
who
only
need
st
not
to
judge
a
creature
by
his
deeds
which
so
seldom
are
his
god
nathan
templar
templar
hoa
nathan
take
me
with
you
nathan
ha
who
calls
is
it
you
knight
and
whither
have
you
been
that
you
could
not
be
met
with
at
the
sultan
s
templar
we
missed
each
it
not
amiss
nathan
i
no
but
saladin
templar
you
was
just
gone
nathan
o
then
you
spoke
with
him
i
m
satisfied
templar
he
wants
to
talk
with
us
together
nathan
so
much
the
better
come
with
me
my
step
was
eitherwise
bent
thither
templar
may
i
ask
nathan
who
twas
now
left
you
nathan
did
you
know
him
templar
was
t
that
creature
the
whom
the
hoar
patriarch
has
a
knack
of
using
to
feel
his
way
out
nathan
that
may
be
in
fact
he
s
at
the
patriarch
s
templar
tis
no
awkward
hit
to
make
simplicity
the
harbinger
of
craft
nathan
if
the
simplicity
of
dunces
but
if
of
honest
piety
templar
this
last
no
patriarch
can
believe
in
nathan
i
ll
be
bound
for
t
this
last
belongs
to
him
who
quitted
me
he
ll
not
assist
his
patriarch
to
accomplish
a
vile
or
cruel
purpose
templar
such
at
least
he
would
has
he
told
you
then
something
of
me
nathan
of
you
by
name
he
can
t
well
be
acquainted
with
your
name
templar
no
that
not
nathan
he
indeed
spoke
of
a
templar
templar
what
nathan
but
by
this
templar
could
not
mean
to
point
out
you
templar
stay
stay
who
knows
let
s
hear
nathan
who
has
accused
me
to
his
patriarch
templar
accused
thee
no
that
by
his
leave
is
false
nathan
do
hear
am
not
the
man
who
would
deny
a
single
of
his
actions
what
i
have
done
i
did
nor
am
i
one
who
would
defend
all
he
has
done
as
why
be
ashamed
of
failing
am
i
not
firmly
resolved
on
better
future
conduct
and
am
i
not
aware
how
much
the
man
that
s
willing
can
improve
o
hear
me
i
am
the
templar
your
talked
who
has
know
what
made
me
angry
what
set
the
blood
in
all
my
veins
on
fire
the
that
i
had
drawn
nigh
to
fling
myself
with
soul
and
body
whole
into
your
you
received
me
how
cold
how
lukewarm
for
that
s
worse
than
how
with
words
weighed
and
measured
you
took
care
to
put
me
off
and
with
what
questioning
about
my
parentage
and
god
knows
what
you
seemed
to
answer
must
not
think
on
t
if
i
would
keep
my
me
while
in
this
steps
behind
me
bolts
out
a
secret
in
my
ear
which
seemed
at
once
to
lend
a
clue
to
your
behaviour
nathan
how
so
templar
do
hear
me
to
the
end
i
fancied
that
what
you
from
the
christians
had
purloined
you
wasn
t
content
to
let
a
christian
have
and
so
the
project
struck
me
short
and
good
to
hold
the
knife
to
your
throat
nathan
short
and
good
and
where
s
the
good
templar
yet
hear
me
nathan
i
own
i
did
not
are
unguilty
no
doubt
the
prating
daya
does
not
know
what
she
a
grudge
against
seeks
to
involve
you
in
an
ugly
may
be
may
be
and
i
m
a
crazy
looby
a
credulous
ways
doing
ever
much
too
much
or
much
too
that
too
may
me
nathan
nathan
if
such
be
the
light
in
which
you
templar
in
short
i
to
the
patriarch
went
i
named
you
not
that
as
i
said
