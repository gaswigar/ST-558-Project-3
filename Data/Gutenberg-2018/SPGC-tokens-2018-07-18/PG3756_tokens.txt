indiscretions
of
archie
by
wodehouse
it
was
archie
fault
really
its
true
he
went
to
america
and
fell
in
love
with
lucille
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire
hotel
proprietor
and
if
he
did
marry
her
well
what
else
was
there
to
do
from
his
point
of
view
the
whole
thing
was
a
thoroughly
good
egg
but
brewster
his
thought
differently
archie
had
neither
money
nor
occupation
which
was
distasteful
in
the
eyes
of
the
industrious
brewster
but
the
real
bar
was
the
fact
that
he
had
once
adversely
criticised
one
of
his
hotels
archie
does
his
best
to
heal
the
breach
but
being
something
of
an
ass
genus
priceless
he
finds
it
almost
beyond
his
powers
to
placate
the
fish
whom
providence
has
given
him
as
a
wodehouse
author
of
the
little
warrior

to
my
dear
buddy
we
have
been
friends
for
eighteen
years
a
considerable
proportion
of
my
books
were
written
under
your
hospitable
roof
and
yet
i
have
never
dedicated
one
to
you
what
will
be
the
verdict
of
posterity
on
this
the
fact
is
i
have
become
rather
superstitious
about
dedications
no

do
you
label
a

the

my

x

x
cuts
you

or
you
bring

distressing
scene
i
say
laddie
said
archie
sir
replied
the
alertly
all
the
employes
of
the
hotel
cosmopolis
were
alert
it
was
one
of
the
things
on
which
daniel
brewster
the
proprietor
insisted
and
as
he
was
always
wandering
about
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
keeping
a
personal
eye
on
affairs
it
was
never
safe
to
relax
i
want
to
see
the
is
there
anything
i
could
do
sir
archie
looked
at
him
doubtfully
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
dear
old
he
said
i
want
to
kick
up
a
fearful
row
and
it
hardly
seems
fair
to
lug
you
into
it
why
you
i
mean
to
say
the
blighter
whose
head
i
want
on
a
charger
is
the
bally
at
this
point
a
massive
man
who
had
been
standing
close
by
gazing
on
the
lobby
with
an
air
of
restrained
severity
as
if
daring
it
to
start
anything
joined
in
the
conversation
i
am
the
manager
he
said
his
eye
was
cold
and
hostile
others
it
seemed
to
say
might
like
archie
moffam
but
not
he
daniel
brewster
was
bristling
for
combat
what
he
had
overheard
had
shocked
him
to
the
core
of
his
being
the
hotel
cosmopolis
was
his
own
private
personal
property
and
the
thing
dearest
to
him
in
the
world
after
his
daughter
lucille
he
prided
himself
on
the
fact
that
his
hotel
was
not
like
other
new
york
hotels
which
were
run
by
impersonal
companies
and
shareholders
and
boards
of
directors
and
consequently
lacked
the
paternal
touch
which
made
the
cosmopolis
what
it
was
at
other
hotels
things
went
wrong
and
clients
complained
at
the
cosmopolis
things
never
went
wrong
because
he
was
on
the
spot
to
see
that
they
did
and
as
a
result
clients
never
complained
yet
here
was
this
long
thin
of
an
englishman
actually
registering
annoyance
and
dissatisfaction
before
his
very
eyes
what
is
your
complaint
he
enquired
frigidly
archie
attached
himself
to
the
top
button
of
brewster
coat
and
was
immediately
dislodged
by
an
irritable
jerk
of
the
substantial
body
listen
old
thing
i
came
over
to
this
country
to
nose
about
in
search
of
a
job
because
there
does
seem
what
you
might
call
a
general
demand
for
my
services
in
england
directly
i
was
demobbed
the
family
started
talking
about
the
land
of
opportunity
and
shot
me
on
to
a
liner
the
idea
was
that
i
might
get
hold
of
something
in
america
he
got
hold
of
brewster
and
was
again
shaken
off
between
ourselves
i
never
done
anything
much
in
england
and
i
fancy
the
family
were
getting
a
bit
fed
at
any
rate
they
sent
me
over
here
brewster
disentangled
himself
for
the
third
time
i
would
prefer
to
postpone
the
story
of
your
life
he
said
coldly
and
be
informed
what
is
your
specific
complaint
against
the
hotel
of
course
yes
the
jolly
old
hotel
i
coming
to
that
well
it
was
like
this
a
chappie
on
the
boat
told
me
that
this
was
the
best
place
to
stop
at
in
new
york
he
was
quite
right
said
brewster
was
he
by
jove
well
all
i
can
say
then
is
that
the
other
new
york
hotels
must
be
pretty
mouldy
if
this
is
the
best
of
the
lot
i
took
a
room
here
last
night
said
archie
quivering
with
and
there
was
a
beastly
tap
outside
somewhere
which
went
all
night
and
kept
me
brewster
annoyance
deepened
he
felt
that
a
chink
had
been
found
in
his
armour
not
even
the
most
paternal
can
keep
an
eye
on
every
tap
in
his
establishment
repeated
archie
firmly
and
i
put
my
boots
outside
the
door
when
i
went
to
bed
and
this
morning
they
had
been
touched
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
not
naturally
said
brewster
my
employes
are
honest
but
i
wanted
them
cleaned
dash
it
there
is
a
parlour
in
the
basement
at
the
cosmopolis
shoes
left
outside
bedroom
doors
are
not
then
i
think
the
cosmopolis
is
a
bally
rotten
hotel
brewster
compact
frame
quivered
the
unforgivable
insult
had
been
offered
question
the
legitimacy
of
brewster
parentage
knock
brewster
down
and
walk
on
his
face
with
spiked
shoes
and
you
did
not
irremediably
close
all
avenues
to
a
peaceful
settlement
but
make
a
remark
like
that
about
his
hotel
and
war
was
definitely
declared
in
that
case
he
said
stiffening
i
must
ask
you
to
give
up
your
i
going
to
give
it
up
i
would
stay
in
the
bally
place
another
brewster
walked
away
and
archie
charged
round
to
the
desk
to
get
his
bill
it
had
been
his
intention
in
any
case
though
for
dramatic
purposes
he
concealed
it
from
his
adversary
to
leave
the
hotel
that
morning
one
of
the
letters
of
introduction
which
he
had
brought
over
from
england
had
resulted
in
an
invitation
from
a
van
tuyl
to
her
at
miami
and
he
had
decided
to
go
there
at
once
well
mused
archie
on
his
way
to
the
station
one
thing
certain
i
never
set
foot
in
that
bally
place
again
but
nothing
in
this
world
is
certain
chapter
ii
a
shock
for
brewster
daniel
brewster
sat
in
his
luxurious
suite
at
the
cosmopolis
smoking
one
of
his
admirable
cigars
and
chatting
with
his
old
friend
professor
binstead
a
stranger
who
had
only
encountered
brewster
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
would
have
been
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
his
for
it
had
none
of
the
rugged
simplicity
which
was
the
keynote
of
its
owner
personal
appearance
daniel
brewster
was
a
man
with
a
hobby
he
was
what
parker
his
valet
termed
a
connoozer
his
educated
taste
in
art
was
one
of
the
things
which
went
to
make
the
cosmopolis
different
from
and
superior
to
other
new
york
hotels
he
had
personally
selected
the
tapestries
in
the
and
the
various
paintings
throughout
the
building
and
in
his
private
capacity
he
was
an
enthusiastic
collector
of
things
which
professor
binstead
whose
tastes
lay
in
the
same
direction
would
have
stolen
without
a
twinge
of
conscience
if
he
could
have
got
the
chance
the
professor
a
small
man
of
middle
age
who
wore
spectacles
flitted
covetously
about
the
room
inspecting
its
treasures
with
a
glistening
eye
in
a
corner
parker
a
grave
lean
individual
bent
over
the
in
which
he
was
preparing
for
his
employer
and
his
guest
their
simple
lunch
brewster
said
professor
binstead
pausing
at
the
mantelpiece
brewster
looked
up
amiably
he
was
in
placid
mood
two
weeks
and
more
had
passed
since
the
meeting
with
archie
recorded
in
the
previous
chapter
and
he
had
been
able
to
dismiss
that
disturbing
affair
from
his
mind
since
then
everything
had
gone
splendidly
with
daniel
brewster
for
he
had
just
accomplished
his
ambition
of
the
moment
by
completing
the
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
a
site
further
on
which
he
proposed
to
erect
a
new
hotel
he
liked
building
hotels
he
had
the
cosmopolis
his
a
summer
hotel
in
the
mountains
purchased
in
the
previous
year
and
he
was
toying
with
the
idea
of
running
over
to
england
and
putting
up
another
in
london
that
however
would
have
to
wait
meanwhile
he
would
concentrate
on
this
new
one
it
had
kept
him
busy
and
worried
arranging
for
securing
the
site
but
his
troubles
were
over
now
yes
he
said
professor
binstead
had
picked
up
a
small
china
figure
of
delicate
workmanship
it
represented
a
warrior
of
days
advancing
with
a
spear
upon
some
adversary
who
judging
from
the
contented
expression
on
the
warrior
face
was
smaller
than
himself
where
did
you
get
this
that
mawson
my
agent
found
it
in
a
little
shop
on
the
east
where
the
other
there
ought
to
be
another
these
things
go
in
pairs
they
valueless
brewster
brow
clouded
i
know
that
he
said
shortly
mawson
looking
for
the
other
one
everywhere
if
you
happen
across
it
i
give
you
carte
blanche
to
buy
it
for
it
must
be
yes
if
you
find
it
do
worry
about
the
expense
i
settle
up
no
matter
what
it
i
bear
it
in
mind
said
professor
binstead
it
may
cost
you
a
lot
of
money
i
suppose
you
know
i
told
you
i
do
care
what
it
it
nice
to
be
a
millionaire
sighed
professor
binstead
luncheon
is
served
sir
said
parker
he
had
stationed
himself
in
a
statutesque
pose
behind
chair
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
he
went
to
the
door
and
returned
with
a
telegram
telegram
for
you
brewster
nodded
carelessly
the
contents
of
the
had
justified
the
advance
advertising
of
their
odour
and
he
was
too
busy
to
be
interrupted
put
it
down
and
you
need
wait
very
good
the
valet
withdrew
and
brewster
resumed
his
lunch
are
you
going
to
open
it
asked
professor
binstead
to
whom
a
telegram
was
a
telegram
it
can
wait
i
get
them
all
day
long
i
expect
it
from
lucille
saying
what
train
she
she
returns
yes
been
at
brewster
having
dwelt
at
adequate
length
on
the
contents
of
the
adjusted
his
glasses
and
took
up
the
envelope
i
shall
be
glad
great
godfrey
he
sat
staring
at
the
telegram
his
mouth
open
his
friend
eyed
him
solicitously
no
bad
news
i
hope
brewster
gurgled
in
a
strangled
way
bad
news
bad
here
read
it
for
professor
binstead
one
of
the
three
most
inquisitive
men
in
new
york
took
the
slip
of
paper
with
gratitude
new
york
with
darling
archie
he
read
of
love
from
us
both
lucille
he
gaped
at
his
host
who
is
archie
he
enquired
who
is
archie
echoed
brewster
helplessly
who
is
that
just
what
i
would
like
to
archie
murmured
the
professor
musing
over
the
telegram
with
darling
archie
strange
brewster
continued
to
stare
before
him
when
you
send
your
only
daughter
on
a
visit
to
miami
minus
any
entanglements
and
she
mentions
in
a
telegram
that
she
has
acquired
a
darling
archie
you
are
naturally
startled
he
rose
from
the
table
with
a
bound
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
by
neglecting
a
careful
study
of
his
mail
during
the
past
week
as
was
his
bad
habit
when
busy
he
had
lost
an
opportunity
of
keeping
abreast
with
current
happenings
he
recollected
now
that
a
letter
had
arrived
from
lucille
some
time
ago
and
that
he
had
put
it
away
unopened
till
he
should
have
leisure
to
read
it
lucille
was
a
dear
girl
he
had
felt
but
her
letters
when
on
a
vacation
seldom
contained
anything
that
could
wait
a
few
days
for
a
reading
he
sprang
for
his
desk
rummaged
among
his
papers
and
found
what
he
was
seeking
it
was
a
long
letter
and
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
some
moments
while
he
mastered
its
contents
then
he
turned
to
the
professor
breathing
heavily
good
heavens
yes
said
professor
binstead
eagerly
yes
good
lord
well
good
gracious
what
is
it
demanded
the
professor
in
an
agony
brewster
sat
down
again
with
a
thud
she
married
married
married
to
an
englishman
bless
my
soul
she
says
proceeded
brewster
referring
to
the
letter
again
that
they
were
both
so
much
in
love
that
they
simply
had
to
slip
off
and
get
married
and
she
hopes
i
wo
be
cross
cross
gasped
brewster
gazing
wildly
at
his
friend
very
disturbing
disturbing
you
bet
it
disturbing
i
do
know
anything
about
the
fellow
never
heard
of
him
in
my
life
she
says
he
wanted
a
quiet
wedding
because
he
thought
a
fellow
looked
such
a
chump
getting
married
and
i
must
love
him
because
he
all
set
to
love
me
very
much
extraordinary
brewster
put
the
letter
down
an
englishman
i
have
met
some
very
agreeable
englishmen
said
professor
binstead
i
do
like
englishmen
growled
brewster
parker
an
your
valet
yes
i
believe
he
wears
my
shirts
on
the
sly
said
brewster
broodingly
if
i
catch
him
what
would
you
do
about
this
binstead
do
the
professor
considered
the
point
judiciary
well
really
brewster
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
anything
you
can
do
you
must
simply
wait
and
meet
the
man
perhaps
he
will
turn
out
an
admirable
h
brewster
declined
to
take
an
optimistic
view
but
an
englishman
binstead
he
said
with
pathos
why
he
went
on
memory
suddenly
stirring
there
was
an
englishman
at
this
hotel
only
a
week
or
two
ago
who
went
about
knocking
it
in
a
way
that
would
have
amazed
you
said
it
was
a
rotten
place
my
hotel
professor
binstead
clicked
his
tongue
sympathetically
he
understood
his
friend
warmth
chapter
iii
brewster
delivers
sentence
at
about
the
same
moment
that
professor
binstead
was
clicking
his
tongue
in
brewster
archie
moffam
sat
contemplating
his
bride
in
a
on
the
express
from
miami
he
was
thinking
that
this
was
too
good
to
be
true
his
brain
had
been
in
something
of
a
whirl
these
last
few
days
but
this
was
one
thought
that
never
failed
to
emerge
clearly
from
the
welter
archie
moffam
nee
lucille
brewster
was
small
and
slender
she
had
a
little
animated
face
set
in
a
cloud
of
dark
hair
she
was
so
altogether
perfect
that
archie
had
frequently
found
himself
compelled
to
take
the
out
of
his
inside
pocket
and
study
it
furtively
to
make
himself
realise
that
this
miracle
of
good
fortune
had
actually
happened
to
him
honestly
old
bean
i
mean
dear
old
thing
i
mean
darling
said
archie
i
ca
believe
it
what
what
i
mean
is
i
ca
understand
why
you
should
have
married
a
blighter
like
lucille
eyes
opened
she
squeezed
his
hand
why
you
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
precious
surely
you
know
that
absolutely
escaped
my
notice
are
you
sure
of
course
i
sure
you
nobody
could
see
you
without
loving
you
archie
heaved
an
ecstatic
sigh
then
a
thought
crossed
his
mind
it
was
a
thought
which
frequently
came
to
mar
his
bliss
i
say
i
wonder
if
your
father
will
think
that
of
course
he
will
we
rather
sprung
this
as
it
were
on
the
old
lad
said
archie
dubiously
what
sort
of
a
man
is
your
father
father
a
darling
rummy
thing
he
should
own
that
hotel
said
archie
i
had
a
frightful
row
with
a
blighter
of
a
manager
there
just
before
i
left
for
miami
your
father
ought
to
sack
that
chap
he
was
a
blot
on
the
landscape
it
had
been
settled
by
lucille
during
the
journey
that
archie
should
be
broken
gently
to
his
that
is
to
say
instead
of
bounding
blithely
into
brewster
presence
hand
in
hand
the
happy
pair
should
separate
for
half
an
hour
or
so
archie
hanging
around
in
the
offing
while
lucille
saw
her
father
and
told
him
the
whole
story
or
those
chapters
of
it
which
she
had
omitted
from
her
letter
for
want
of
space
then
having
impressed
brewster
sufficiently
with
his
luck
in
having
acquired
archie
for
a
she
would
lead
him
to
where
his
bit
of
good
fortune
awaited
him
the
programme
worked
out
admirably
in
its
earlier
stages
when
the
two
emerged
from
brewster
room
to
meet
archie
brewster
general
idea
was
that
fortune
had
smiled
upon
him
in
an
almost
unbelievable
fashion
and
had
presented
him
with
a
who
combined
in
almost
equal
parts
the
more
admirable
characteristics
of
apollo
sir
galahad
and
marcus
aurelius
true
he
had
gathered
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
that
dear
archie
had
no
occupation
and
no
private
means
but
brewster
felt
that
a
man
like
archie
did
need
them
you
ca
have
everything
and
archie
according
to
account
was
practically
a
hundred
per
cent
man
in
soul
looks
manners
amiability
and
breeding
these
are
the
things
that
count
brewster
proceeded
to
the
lobby
in
a
glow
of
optimism
and
geniality
consequently
when
he
perceived
archie
he
got
a
bit
of
a
shock
hullo
ullo
ullo
said
archie
advancing
happily
archie
darling
this
is
father
said
lucille
good
lord
said
archie
there
was
one
of
those
silences
brewster
looked
at
archie
archie
gazed
at
brewster
lucille
perceiving
without
understanding
why
that
the
big
introduction
scene
had
stubbed
its
toe
on
some
obstacle
waited
anxiously
for
enlightenment
meanwhile
archie
continued
to
inspect
brewster
and
brewster
continued
to
drink
in
archie
after
an
awkward
pause
of
about
three
and
a
quarter
minutes
brewster
swallowed
once
or
twice
and
finally
spoke
lu
yes
father
is
this
true
lucille
grey
eyes
clouded
over
with
perplexity
and
apprehension
true
have
you
really
inflicted
this
this
on
me
for
a
brewster
swallowed
a
few
more
times
archie
the
while
watching
with
a
frozen
fascination
the
rapid
shimmying
of
his
new
go
away
i
want
to
have
a
few
words
alone
with
this
this
wassyourdamname
he
demanded
in
an
overwrought
manner
addressing
archie
for
the
first
time
i
told
you
father
it
moom
it
spelt
but
pronounced
to
rhyme
said
archie
helpfully
with
lu
said
brewster
run
away
i
want
to
speak
you
called
me
this
before
said
archie
you
are
angry
father
dear
said
lucilla
oh
no
oh
no
i
tickled
to
death
when
his
daughter
had
withdrawn
brewster
drew
a
long
breath
now
then
he
said
bit
embarrassing
all
this
what
said
archie
chattily
i
mean
to
say
having
met
before
in
less
happy
circs
and
what
not
rum
coincidence
and
so
forth
how
would
it
be
to
bury
the
jolly
old
hatchet
start
a
new
life
forgive
and
forget
learn
to
love
each
other
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
i
game
if
you
are
how
do
we
go
is
it
a
bet
brewster
remained
entirely
unsoftened
by
this
manly
appeal
to
his
better
feelings
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
marrying
my
daughter
archie
reflected
well
it
sort
of
happened
do
you
know
you
know
how
these
things
are
young
yourself
once
and
all
that
i
was
most
frightfully
in
love
and
lu
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
a
bad
scheme
and
one
thing
led
to
another
and
well
there
you
are
do
you
know
and
i
suppose
you
think
you
done
pretty
well
for
yourself
oh
absolutely
as
far
as
i
concerned
everything
topping
never
felt
so
braced
in
my
life
yes
said
brewster
with
bitterness
i
suppose
from
your
everything
is
you
have
a
cent
to
your
name
and
you
managed
to
fool
a
rich
man
daughter
into
marrying
you
i
suppose
you
looked
me
up
in
bradstreet
before
committing
yourself
this
aspect
of
the
matter
had
not
struck
archie
until
this
moment
i
say
he
observed
with
dismay
i
never
looked
at
it
like
that
before
i
can
see
that
from
your
point
of
view
this
must
look
like
a
bit
of
a
how
do
you
propose
to
support
lucille
anyway
archie
ran
a
finger
round
the
inside
of
his
collar
he
felt
embarrassed
his
was
opening
up
all
kinds
of
new
lines
of
thought
well
there
old
bean
he
admitted
frankly
you
rather
have
me
he
turned
the
matter
over
for
a
moment
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
of
as
it
were
working
if
you
know
what
i
working
at
what
now
there
again
you
stump
me
somewhat
the
general
scheme
was
that
i
should
kind
of
look
round
you
know
and
nose
about
and
buzz
to
and
fro
till
something
turned
up
that
was
broadly
speaking
the
notion
and
how
did
you
suppose
my
daughter
was
to
live
while
you
were
doing
all
this
well
i
think
said
archie
i
think
we
rather
expected
you
to
rally
round
a
bit
for
the
nonce
i
see
you
expected
to
live
on
me
well
you
put
it
a
bit
crudely
but
as
far
as
i
had
mapped
anything
out
that
was
what
you
might
call
the
general
scheme
of
procedure
you
do
think
much
of
it
what
yes
no
brewster
exploded
no
i
do
not
think
much
of
it
good
god
you
go
out
of
my
hotel
my
hotel
calling
it
all
the
names
you
could
think
of
roasting
it
to
beat
the
band
trifle
hasty
murmured
archie
apologetically
spoke
without
thinking
dashed
tap
had
gone
all
night
kept
me
awake
had
had
breakfast
bygones
be
bygones
do
interrupt
i
say
you
go
out
of
my
hotel
knocking
it
as
no
one
has
ever
knocked
it
since
it
was
built
and
you
sneak
straight
off
and
marry
my
daughter
without
my
did
think
of
wiring
for
blessing
slipped
the
old
bean
somehow
you
know
how
one
forgets
things
and
now
you
come
back
and
calmly
expect
me
to
fling
my
arms
round
you
and
kiss
you
and
support
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
only
while
i
nosing
about
and
buzzing
to
and
well
i
suppose
i
got
to
support
you
there
seems
no
way
out
of
it
i
tell
you
exactly
what
i
propose
to
do
you
think
my
hotel
is
a
pretty
poor
hotel
eh
well
you
have
plenty
of
opportunity
of
judging
because
you
coming
to
live
here
i
let
you
have
a
suite
and
i
let
you
have
your
meals
but
outside
of
that
nothing
doing
nothing
doing
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
absolutely
you
mean
you
can
sign
bills
for
a
reasonable
amount
in
my
restaurant
and
the
hotel
will
look
after
your
laundry
but
not
a
cent
do
you
get
out
me
and
if
you
want
your
shoes
shined
you
can
pay
for
it
yourself
in
the
basement
if
you
leave
them
outside
your
door
i
instruct
the
to
throw
them
down
the
do
you
understand
good
now
is
there
anything
more
you
want
to
ask
archie
smiled
a
propitiatory
smile
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
going
to
ask
if
you
would
stagger
along
and
have
a
bite
with
us
in
the
i
will
not
i
sign
the
bill
said
archie
ingratiatingly
you
do
think
much
of
it
oh
chapter
iv
work
wanted
it
seemed
to
archie
as
he
surveyed
his
position
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
of
his
married
life
that
all
was
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
in
their
attitude
towards
america
visiting
englishmen
almost
invariably
incline
to
extremes
either
detesting
all
that
therein
is
or
else
becoming
enthusiasts
on
the
subject
of
the
country
its
climate
and
its
institutions
archie
belonged
to
the
second
class
he
liked
america
and
got
on
splendidly
with
americans
from
the
start
he
was
a
friendly
soul
a
mixer
and
in
new
york
that
city
of
mixers
he
found
himself
at
home
the
atmosphere
of
and
the
hospitality
of
everybody
he
met
appealed
to
him
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
new
york
had
simply
been
waiting
for
him
to
arrive
before
giving
the
word
to
let
the
revels
commence
nothing
of
course
in
this
world
is
perfect
and
rosy
as
were
the
glasses
through
which
archie
looked
on
his
new
surroundings
he
had
to
admit
that
there
was
one
flaw
one
fly
in
the
ointment
one
individual
caterpillar
in
the
salad
daniel
brewster
his
remained
consistently
unfriendly
indeed
his
manner
towards
his
new
relative
became
daily
more
and
more
a
manner
which
would
have
caused
gossip
on
the
plantation
if
simon
legree
had
exhibited
it
in
his
relations
with
uncle
tom
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
archie
as
early
as
the
third
morning
of
his
stay
had
gone
to
him
and
in
the
most
frank
and
manly
way
had
withdrawn
his
criticism
of
the
hotel
cosmopolis
giving
it
as
his
considered
opinion
that
the
hotel
cosmopolis
on
closer
inspection
appeared
to
be
a
good
egg
one
of
the
best
and
brightest
and
a
bit
of
all
right
a
credit
to
you
old
thing
said
archie
cordially
do
call
me
old
thing
growled
brewster
old
companion
said
archie
amiably
archie
a
true
philosopher
bore
this
hostility
with
fortitude
but
it
worried
lucille
i
do
wish
father
understood
you
better
was
her
wistful
comment
when
archie
had
related
the
conversation
well
you
know
said
archie
i
open
for
being
understood
any
time
he
cares
to
take
a
stab
at
you
must
try
and
make
him
fond
of
but
how
i
smile
winsomely
at
him
and
what
not
but
he
well
we
shall
have
to
think
of
something
i
want
him
to
realise
what
an
angel
you
are
you
are
an
angel
you
no
really
of
course
you
it
a
rummy
thing
said
archie
pursuing
a
train
of
thought
which
was
constantly
with
him
the
more
i
see
of
you
the
more
i
wonder
how
you
can
have
a
father
like
i
mean
to
say
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
wish
i
had
known
your
mother
she
must
have
been
frightfully
what
would
really
please
him
i
know
said
lucille
would
be
if
you
got
some
work
to
do
he
loves
people
who
yes
said
archie
doubtfully
well
you
know
i
heard
him
interviewing
that
chappie
behind
the
desk
this
morning
who
works
like
the
dickens
from
early
morn
to
dewy
eve
on
the
subject
of
a
mistake
in
his
figures
and
if
he
loved
him
he
dissembled
it
all
right
of
course
i
admit
that
so
far
i
have
been
one
of
the
toilers
but
the
dashed
difficult
thing
is
to
know
how
to
start
i
nosing
round
but
the
openings
for
a
bright
young
man
seem
so
well
keep
on
trying
i
feel
sure
that
if
you
could
only
find
something
to
do
it
does
matter
what
father
would
be
quite
it
was
possibly
the
dazzling
prospect
of
making
brewster
quite
different
that
stimulated
archie
he
was
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
any
change
in
his
must
inevitably
be
for
the
better
a
chance
meeting
with
james
wheeler
the
artist
at
the
club
seemed
to
open
the
way
to
a
visitor
to
new
york
who
has
the
ability
to
make
himself
liked
it
almost
appears
as
though
the
leading
industry
in
that
city
was
the
issuing
of
to
clubs
archie
since
his
arrival
had
been
showered
with
these
pleasant
evidences
of
his
popularity
and
he
was
now
an
honorary
member
of
so
many
clubs
of
various
kinds
that
he
had
not
time
to
go
to
them
all
there
were
the
fashionable
clubs
along
fifth
avenue
to
which
his
friend
reggie
van
tuyl
son
of
his
florida
hostess
had
introduced
him
there
were
the
businessmen
clubs
of
which
he
was
made
free
by
more
solid
citizens
and
best
of
all
there
were
the
lambs
the
players
the
friars
the
the
and
the
other
resorts
of
the
artist
the
author
the
actor
and
the
bohemian
it
was
in
these
that
archie
spent
most
of
his
time
and
it
was
here
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
j
wheeler
the
popular
illustrator
to
wheeler
over
a
friendly
lunch
archie
had
been
confiding
some
of
his
ambitions
to
qualify
as
the
hero
of
one
of
the
you
want
a
job
said
wheeler
i
want
a
job
said
archie
wheeler
consumed
eight
fried
potatoes
in
quick
succession
he
was
an
able
trencherman
i
always
looked
on
you
as
one
of
our
leading
lilies
of
the
field
he
said
why
this
anxiety
to
toil
and
spin
well
my
wife
you
know
seems
to
think
it
might
put
me
with
the
jolly
old
dad
if
i
did
and
you
not
particular
what
you
do
so
long
as
it
has
the
outer
aspect
of
work
anything
in
the
world
laddie
anything
in
the
then
come
and
pose
for
a
picture
i
doing
said
j
wheeler
for
a
magazine
cover
you
just
the
model
i
want
and
i
pay
you
at
the
usual
rates
is
it
a
go
pose
you
only
got
to
stand
still
and
look
like
a
chunk
of
wood
you
can
do
that
surely
i
can
do
that
said
archie
then
come
along
down
to
my
studio
said
archie
chapter
strange
experiences
of
an
artist
model
i
say
old
thing
archie
spoke
plaintively
already
he
was
looking
back
ruefully
to
the
time
when
he
had
supposed
that
an
artist
model
had
a
soft
job
in
the
first
five
minutes
muscles
which
he
had
not
been
aware
that
he
possessed
had
started
to
ache
like
neglected
teeth
his
respect
for
the
toughness
and
durability
of
artists
models
was
now
solid
how
they
acquired
the
stamina
to
go
through
this
sort
of
thing
all
day
and
then
bound
off
to
bohemian
revels
at
night
was
more
than
he
could
understand
do
wobble
confound
you
snorted
wheeler
yes
but
my
dear
old
artist
said
archie
what
you
do
seem
to
grasp
what
you
appear
not
to
realise
is
that
i
getting
a
crick
in
the
you
weakling
you
miserable
invertebrate
worm
move
an
inch
and
i
murder
you
and
come
and
dance
on
your
grave
every
wednesday
and
saturday
i
just
getting
it
in
the
spine
that
it
seems
to
catch
me
be
a
man
you
urged
j
wheeler
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
why
a
girl
who
was
posing
for
me
last
week
stood
for
a
solid
hour
on
one
leg
holding
a
tennis
racket
over
her
head
and
smiling
brightly
the
female
of
the
species
is
more
than
the
male
argued
archie
well
i
be
through
in
a
few
minutes
do
weaken
think
how
proud
you
be
when
you
see
yourself
on
all
the
archie
sighed
and
braced
himself
to
the
task
once
more
he
wished
he
had
never
taken
on
this
binge
in
addition
to
his
physical
discomfort
he
was
feeling
a
most
awful
chump
the
cover
on
which
wheeler
was
engaged
was
for
the
august
number
of
the
magazine
and
it
had
been
necessary
for
archie
to
drape
his
reluctant
form
in
a
bathing
suit
of
a
vivid
lemon
colour
for
he
was
supposed
to
be
representing
one
of
those
jolly
dogs
belonging
to
the
best
families
who
dive
off
floats
at
exclusive
seashore
resorts
j
wheeler
a
stickler
for
accuracy
had
wanted
him
to
remove
his
socks
and
shoes
but
there
archie
had
stood
firm
he
was
willing
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
but
not
a
silly
ass
all
right
said
j
wheeler
laying
down
his
brush
that
will
do
for
though
speaking
without
prejudice
and
with
no
wish
to
be
offensive
if
i
had
had
a
model
who
was
a
son
of
belial
i
could
have
got
the
darned
thing
finished
without
having
to
have
another
i
wonder
why
you
chappies
call
this
sort
of
thing
said
archie
pensively
as
he
conducted
tentative
experiments
in
osteopathy
on
his
aching
back
i
say
old
thing
i
could
do
with
a
restorative
if
you
have
one
handy
but
of
course
you
have
i
suppose
he
added
resignedly
abstemious
as
a
rule
there
were
moments
when
archie
found
the
eighteenth
amendment
somewhat
trying
j
wheeler
shook
his
head
you
a
little
previous
he
said
but
come
round
in
another
day
or
so
and
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
he
moved
with
a
certain
caution
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
lifting
to
one
side
a
pile
of
canvases
revealed
a
stout
barrel
which
he
regarded
with
a
fatherly
and
benignant
eye
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
in
the
fullness
of
time
i
believe
this
is
going
to
spread
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
and
oh
ah
said
archie
interested
what
made
with
these
hands
i
added
a
few
more
raisins
yesterday
to
speed
things
up
a
bit
there
is
much
virtue
in
your
raisin
and
talking
of
speeding
things
up
for
goodness
sake
try
to
be
a
bit
more
punctual
we
lost
an
hour
of
good
daylight
i
like
that
i
was
here
on
the
absolute
minute
i
had
to
hang
about
on
the
landing
waiting
for
well
well
that
does
matter
said
j
wheeler
impatiently
for
the
artist
soul
is
always
annoyed
by
petty
details
the
point
is
that
we
were
an
hour
late
in
getting
to
work
mind
you
here
at
eleven
it
was
therefore
with
a
feeling
of
guilt
and
trepidation
that
archie
mounted
the
stairs
on
the
following
morning
for
in
spite
of
his
good
resolutions
he
was
half
an
hour
behind
time
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
his
friend
had
also
lagged
by
the
wayside
the
door
of
the
studio
was
ajar
and
he
went
in
to
discover
the
place
occupied
by
a
lady
of
mature
years
who
was
scrubbing
the
floor
with
a
mop
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
donned
his
bathing
suit
when
he
emerged
ten
minutes
later
the
charwoman
had
gone
but
j
wheeler
was
still
absent
rather
glad
of
the
respite
he
sat
down
to
kill
time
by
reading
the
morning
paper
whose
sporting
page
alone
he
had
managed
to
master
at
the
breakfast
table
there
was
not
a
great
deal
in
the
paper
to
interest
him
the
usual
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
day
and
the
police
were
reported
hot
on
the
trail
of
the
who
was
alleged
to
be
at
the
back
of
these
financial
operations
a
messenger
named
henry
babcock
had
been
arrested
and
was
expected
to
become
confidential
to
one
who
like
archie
had
never
owned
a
bond
the
story
made
little
appeal
he
turned
with
more
interest
to
a
cheery
on
the
activities
of
a
gentleman
in
minnesota
who
with
what
seemed
to
archie
as
he
thought
of
daniel
brewster
a
good
deal
of
resource
and
public
spirit
had
recently
beaned
his
with
the
family
it
was
only
after
he
had
read
this
through
twice
in
a
spirit
of
gentle
approval
that
it
occurred
to
him
that
j
wheeler
was
uncommonly
late
at
the
tryst
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
he
had
been
in
the
studio
of
an
hour
archie
became
restless
old
bean
though
he
was
he
considered
this
a
bit
thick
he
got
up
and
went
out
on
to
the
landing
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
blighter
there
were
none
he
began
to
understand
now
what
had
happened
for
some
reason
or
other
the
bally
artist
was
not
coming
to
the
studio
at
all
that
day
probably
he
had
called
up
the
hotel
and
left
a
message
to
this
effect
and
archie
had
just
missed
it
another
man
might
have
waited
to
make
certain
that
his
message
had
reached
its
destination
but
not
wheeler
the
most
casual
individual
in
new
york
thoroughly
aggrieved
archie
turned
back
to
the
studio
to
dress
and
go
away
his
progress
was
stayed
by
a
solid
forbidding
slab
of
oak
somehow
or
other
since
he
had
left
the
room
the
door
had
managed
to
get
itself
shut
oh
dash
it
said
archie
the
mildness
of
the
expletive
was
proof
that
the
full
horror
of
the
situation
had
not
immediately
come
home
to
him
his
mind
in
the
first
few
moments
was
occupied
with
the
problem
of
how
the
door
had
got
that
way
he
could
not
remember
shutting
it
probably
he
had
done
it
unconsciously
as
a
child
he
had
been
taught
by
sedulous
elders
that
the
little
gentleman
always
closed
doors
behind
him
and
presumably
his
subconscious
self
was
still
under
the
influence
and
then
suddenly
he
realised
that
this
infernal
officious
ass
of
a
subconscious
self
had
deposited
him
right
in
the
gumbo
behind
that
closed
door
unattainable
as
youthful
ambition
lay
his
gent
with
the
green
twill
and
here
he
was
out
in
the
world
alone
in
a
bathing
suit
in
all
crises
of
human
affairs
there
are
two
broad
courses
open
to
a
man
he
can
stay
where
he
is
or
he
can
go
elsewhere
archie
leaning
on
the
banisters
examined
these
alternatives
narrowly
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
he
would
have
to
spend
the
night
on
this
dashed
landing
if
he
legged
it
in
this
kit
he
would
be
gathered
up
by
the
constabulary
before
he
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
he
was
no
pessimist
but
he
was
reluctantly
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
up
against
it
it
was
while
he
was
musing
with
a
certain
tenseness
on
these
things
that
the
sound
of
footsteps
came
to
him
from
below
but
almost
in
the
first
instant
the
hope
that
this
might
be
j
wheeler
the
curse
of
the
human
race
died
away
whoever
was
coming
up
the
stairs
was
running
and
j
wheeler
never
ran
upstairs
he
was
not
one
of
your
lean
haggard
geniuses
he
made
a
large
income
with
his
brush
and
pencil
and
spent
most
of
it
in
creature
comforts
this
could
be
j
wheeler
it
was
not
it
was
a
tall
thin
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
considerable
hurry
he
let
himself
into
the
studio
on
the
floor
below
and
vanished
without
even
waiting
to
shut
the
door
he
had
come
and
disappeared
in
almost
record
time
but
brief
though
his
passing
had
been
it
had
been
long
enough
to
bring
consolation
to
archie
a
sudden
bright
light
had
been
vouchsafed
to
archie
and
he
now
saw
an
admirably
ripe
and
fruity
scheme
for
ending
his
troubles
what
could
be
simpler
than
to
toddle
down
one
flight
of
stairs
and
in
an
easy
and
debonair
manner
ask
the
chappie
permission
to
use
his
telephone
and
what
could
be
simpler
once
he
was
at
the
than
to
get
in
touch
with
somebody
at
the
cosmopolis
who
would
send
down
a
few
trousers
and
what
not
in
a
kit
bag
it
was
a
priceless
solution
thought
archie
as
he
made
his
way
downstairs
not
even
embarrassing
he
meant
to
say
this
chappie
living
in
a
place
like
this
would
bat
an
eyelid
at
the
spectacle
of
a
fellow
trickling
about
the
place
in
a
bathing
suit
they
would
have
a
good
laugh
about
the
whole
thing
i
say
i
hate
to
bother
you
dare
say
you
busy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
would
you
mind
if
i
popped
in
for
half
a
second
and
used
your
that
was
the
speech
the
extremely
gentlemanly
and
speech
which
archie
had
prepared
to
deliver
the
moment
the
man
appeared
the
reason
he
did
not
deliver
it
was
that
the
man
did
not
appear
he
knocked
but
nothing
stirred
i
say
archie
now
perceived
that
the
door
was
ajar
and
that
on
an
envelope
attached
with
a
tack
to
one
of
the
panels
was
the
name
elmer
moon
he
pushed
the
door
a
little
farther
open
and
tried
again
oh
mr
moon
mr
moon
he
waited
a
moment
oh
mr
moon
mr
moon
are
you
there
mr
moon
he
blushed
hotly
to
his
sensitive
ear
the
words
had
sounded
exactly
like
the
opening
line
of
the
refrain
of
a
vaudeville
he
decided
to
waste
no
further
speech
on
a
man
with
such
an
unfortunate
surname
until
he
could
see
him
face
to
face
and
get
a
chance
of
lowering
his
voice
a
bit
absolutely
absurd
to
stand
outside
a
chappie
door
singing
in
a
bathing
suit
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
walked
in
and
his
subconscious
self
always
the
gentleman
closed
it
gently
behind
him
up
said
a
low
sinister
harsh
unfriendly
and
unpleasant
voice
eh
said
archie
revolving
sharply
on
his
axis
he
found
himself
confronting
the
hurried
gentleman
who
had
run
upstairs
this
sprinter
had
produced
an
automatic
pistol
and
was
pointing
it
in
a
truculent
manner
at
his
head
archie
stared
at
his
host
and
his
host
stared
at
him
put
your
hands
up
he
said
oh
absolutely
said
archie
but
i
mean
to
say
the
other
was
drinking
him
in
with
considerable
astonishment
costume
seemed
to
have
made
a
powerful
impression
upon
him
who
the
devil
are
you
he
enquired
me
oh
my
name
never
mind
your
name
what
are
you
doing
here
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
popped
in
to
ask
if
i
might
use
your
you
see
a
certain
relief
seemed
to
temper
the
austerity
of
the
other
gaze
as
a
visitor
archie
though
surprising
seemed
to
be
better
than
he
had
expected
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
you
he
said
meditatively
if
you
just
let
me
toddle
to
the
likely
said
the
man
he
appeared
to
reach
a
decision
here
go
into
that
he
indicated
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
the
open
door
of
what
was
apparently
a
bedroom
at
the
farther
end
of
the
studio
i
take
it
said
archie
chattily
that
all
this
may
seem
to
you
not
a
little
get
on
i
was
only
saying
well
i
have
time
to
listen
get
a
move
on
the
bedroom
was
in
a
state
of
untidiness
which
eclipsed
anything
which
archie
had
ever
witnessed
the
other
appeared
to
be
moving
house
bed
furniture
and
floor
were
covered
with
articles
of
clothing
a
silk
shirt
wreathed
itself
about
archie
ankles
as
he
stood
gaping
and
as
he
moved
farther
into
the
room
his
path
was
paved
with
ties
and
collars
sit
down
said
elmer
moon
abruptly
thanks
said
archie
i
suppose
you
would
like
me
to
explain
and
what
not
what
no
said
mr
moon
i
have
got
your
spare
time
put
your
hands
behind
that
archie
did
so
and
found
them
immediately
secured
by
what
felt
like
a
silk
tie
his
assiduous
host
then
proceeded
to
fasten
his
ankles
in
a
like
manner
this
done
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
done
all
that
was
required
of
him
and
he
returned
to
the
packing
of
a
large
suitcase
which
stood
by
the
window
i
say
said
archie
mr
moon
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
remembered
something
which
he
had
overlooked
shoved
a
sock
in
his
guest
mouth
and
resumed
his
packing
he
was
what
might
be
called
an
impressionist
packer
his
aim
appeared
to
be
speed
rather
than
neatness
he
bundled
his
belongings
in
closed
the
bag
with
some
difficulty
and
stepping
to
the
window
opened
it
then
he
climbed
out
on
to
the
dragged
the
after
him
and
was
gone
archie
left
alone
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
freeing
his
prisoned
limbs
the
job
proved
much
easier
than
he
had
expected
mr
moon
that
hustler
had
wrought
for
the
moment
not
for
all
time
a
practical
man
he
had
been
content
to
keep
his
visitor
shackled
merely
for
such
a
period
as
would
permit
him
to
make
his
escape
unhindered
in
less
than
ten
minutes
archie
after
a
good
deal
of
writhing
was
pleased
to
discover
that
the
thingummy
attached
to
his
wrists
had
loosened
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
use
his
hands
he
untied
himself
and
got
up
he
now
began
to
tell
himself
that
out
of
evil
cometh
good
his
encounter
with
the
elusive
mr
moon
had
not
been
an
agreeable
one
but
it
had
had
this
solid
advantage
that
it
had
left
him
right
in
the
middle
of
a
great
many
clothes
and
mr
moon
whatever
his
moral
defects
had
the
one
excellent
quality
of
taking
about
the
same
size
as
himself
archie
casting
a
covetous
eye
upon
a
tweed
suit
which
lay
on
the
bed
was
on
the
point
of
climbing
into
the
trousers
when
on
the
outer
door
of
the
studio
there
sounded
a
forceful
knocking
open
up
here
chapter
vi
the
bomb
archie
bounded
silently
out
into
the
other
room
and
stood
listening
tensely
he
was
not
a
naturally
querulous
man
but
he
did
feel
at
this
point
that
fate
was
picking
on
him
with
a
somewhat
undue
severity
in
th
name
av
th
law
there
are
times
when
the
best
of
us
lose
our
heads
at
this
juncture
archie
should
undoubtedly
have
gone
to
the
door
opened
it
explained
his
presence
in
a
few
words
and
generally
have
passed
the
whole
thing
off
with
ready
tact
but
the
thought
of
confronting
a
posse
of
police
in
his
present
costume
caused
him
to
look
earnestly
about
him
for
a
up
against
the
farther
wall
was
a
settee
with
a
high
arching
back
which
might
have
been
put
there
for
that
special
purpose
he
inserted
himself
behind
this
just
as
a
splintering
crash
announced
that
the
law
having
gone
through
the
formality
of
knocking
with
its
knuckles
was
now
getting
busy
with
an
axe
a
moment
later
the
door
had
given
way
and
the
room
was
full
of
trampling
feet
archie
wedged
himself
against
the
wall
with
the
quiet
concentration
of
a
clam
nestling
in
its
shell
and
hoped
for
the
best
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
immediate
future
depended
for
better
or
for
worse
entirely
on
the
native
intelligence
of
the
force
if
they
were
the
bright
alert
men
he
hoped
they
were
they
would
see
all
that
junk
in
the
bedroom
and
deducing
from
it
that
their
quarry
had
stood
not
upon
the
order
of
his
going
but
had
hopped
it
would
not
waste
time
in
searching
a
presumably
empty
apartment
if
on
the
other
hand
they
were
the
obtuse
persons
who
occasionally
find
their
way
into
the
ranks
of
even
the
most
enlightened
constabularies
they
would
undoubtedly
shift
the
settee
and
drag
him
into
a
publicity
from
which
his
modest
soul
shrank
he
was
enchanted
therefore
a
few
moments
later
to
hear
a
gruff
voice
state
that
th
mutt
had
beaten
it
down
th
his
opinion
of
the
detective
abilities
of
the
new
york
police
force
rose
with
a
bound
there
followed
a
brief
council
of
war
which
as
it
took
place
in
the
bedroom
was
inaudible
to
archie
except
as
a
distant
growling
noise
he
could
distinguish
no
words
but
as
it
was
succeeded
by
a
general
trampling
of
large
boots
in
the
direction
of
the
door
and
then
by
silence
he
gathered
that
the
pack
having
drawn
the
studio
and
found
it
empty
had
decided
to
return
to
other
and
more
profitable
duties
he
gave
them
a
reasonable
interval
for
removing
themselves
and
then
poked
his
head
cautiously
over
the
settee
all
was
peace
the
place
was
empty
no
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
archie
emerged
for
the
first
time
in
this
morning
of
disturbing
occurrences
he
began
to
feel
that
god
was
in
his
heaven
and
all
right
with
the
world
at
last
things
were
beginning
to
brighten
up
a
bit
and
life
might
be
said
to
have
taken
on
some
of
the
aspects
of
a
good
egg
he
stretched
himself
for
it
is
cramping
work
lying
under
settees
and
proceeding
to
the
bedroom
picked
up
the
tweed
trousers
again
clothes
had
a
fascination
for
archie
another
man
in
similar
circumstances
might
have
hurried
over
his
toilet
but
archie
faced
by
a
difficult
choice
of
ties
rather
strung
the
thing
out
he
selected
a
specimen
which
did
great
credit
to
the
taste
of
mr
moon
evidently
one
of
our
snappiest
dressers
found
that
it
did
not
harmonise
with
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
tweed
suit
removed
it
chose
another
and
was
adjusting
the
bow
and
admiring
the
effect
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
a
slight
sound
which
was
half
a
cough
and
half
a
sniff
and
turning
found
himself
gazing
into
the
clear
blue
eyes
of
a
large
man
in
uniform
who
had
stepped
into
the
room
from
the
he
was
swinging
a
substantial
club
in
a
negligent
sort
of
way
and
he
looked
at
archie
with
a
total
absence
of
bonhomie
ah
he
observed
oh
there
you
are
said
archie
subsiding
weakly
against
the
chest
of
drawers
he
gulped
of
course
i
can
see
you
thinking
all
this
pretty
tolerably
weird
and
all
that
he
proceeded
in
a
propitiatory
voice
the
policeman
attempted
no
analysis
of
his
emotions
he
opened
a
mouth
which
a
moment
before
had
looked
incapable
of
being
opened
except
with
the
assistance
of
powerful
machinery
and
shouted
a
single
word
cassidy
a
distant
voice
gave
tongue
in
answer
it
was
like
alligators
roaring
to
their
mates
across
lonely
swamps
there
was
a
rumble
of
footsteps
in
the
region
of
the
stairs
and
presently
there
entered
an
even
larger
guardian
of
the
law
than
the
first
exhibit
he
too
swung
a
massive
club
and
like
his
colleague
he
gazed
frostily
at
archie
god
save
ireland
he
remarked
the
words
appeared
to
be
more
in
the
nature
of
an
expletive
than
a
practical
comment
on
the
situation
having
uttered
them
he
draped
himself
in
the
doorway
like
a
colossus
and
chewed
gum
where
ja
get
him
he
enquired
after
a
pause
found
him
in
here
attimpting
to
disguise
i
told
cap
he
was
hiding
somewheres
but
he
would
have
it
that
beat
it
down
th
escape
said
the
with
the
sombre
triumph
of
the
underling
whose
sound
advice
has
been
overruled
by
those
above
him
he
shifted
his
wholesome
or
as
some
say
unwholesome
morsel
to
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
and
for
the
first
time
addressed
archie
directly
ye
pinched
he
observed
archie
started
violently
the
bleak
directness
of
the
speech
roused
him
with
a
jerk
from
the
state
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
had
not
anticipated
this
he
had
assumed
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
tedious
explanations
to
be
gone
through
before
he
was
at
liberty
to
depart
to
the
cosy
little
lunch
for
which
his
interior
had
been
sighing
wistfully
this
long
time
past
but
that
he
should
be
arrested
had
been
outside
his
calculations
of
course
he
could
put
everything
right
eventually
he
could
call
witnesses
to
his
character
and
the
purity
of
his
intentions
but
in
the
meantime
the
whole
dashed
business
would
be
in
all
the
papers
embellished
with
all
those
unpleasant
flippancies
to
which
your
newspaper
reporter
is
so
prone
to
stoop
when
he
sees
half
a
chance
he
would
feel
a
frightful
chump
chappies
would
rot
him
about
it
to
the
most
fearful
extent
old
brewster
name
would
come
into
it
and
he
could
not
disguise
it
from
himself
that
his
who
liked
his
name
in
the
papers
as
little
as
possible
would
be
sorer
than
a
sunburned
neck
no
i
say
you
know
i
mean
i
mean
to
say
pinched
repeated
the
rather
larger
policeman
and
annything
ye
say
added
his
slightly
smaller
colleague
will
be
used
agenst
ya
the
and
if
ya
try
said
the
first
speaker
twiddling
his
club
ya
getja
block
knocked
and
having
sketched
out
this
admirably
clear
and
scenario
the
two
relapsed
into
silence
officer
cassidy
restored
his
gum
to
circulation
officer
donahue
frowned
sternly
at
his
boots
but
i
say
said
archie
it
all
a
mistake
you
know
absolutely
a
frightful
error
my
dear
old
constables
i
not
the
lad
you
after
at
all
the
chappie
you
want
is
a
different
sort
of
fellow
altogether
another
blighter
new
york
policemen
never
laugh
when
on
duty
there
is
probably
something
in
the
regulations
against
it
but
officer
donahue
permitted
the
left
corner
of
his
mouth
to
twitch
slightly
and
a
momentary
muscular
spasm
disturbed
the
calm
of
officer
cassidy
granite
features
as
a
passing
breeze
ruffles
the
surface
of
some
bottomless
lake
that
what
they
all
say
observed
officer
donahue
it
no
use
tryin
that
line
of
talk
said
officer
cassidy
sure
squealed
morning
said
officer
donahue
archie
memory
stirred
vaguely
babcock
he
said
do
you
know
that
name
seems
familiar
to
me
somehow
i
almost
sure
i
read
it
in
the
paper
or
ah
cut
it
out
said
officer
cassidy
disgustedly
the
two
constables
exchanged
a
glance
of
austere
disapproval
this
hypocrisy
pained
them
read
it
in
th
paper
or
something
by
jove
i
remember
now
he
the
chappie
who
was
arrested
in
that
bond
business
for
goodness
sake
my
dear
merry
old
constables
said
archie
astounded
you
surely
are
labouring
under
the
impression
that
i
the
they
were
talking
about
in
the
paper
why
what
an
absolutely
priceless
notion
i
mean
to
say
i
ask
you
what
frankly
laddies
do
i
look
like
a
officer
cassidy
heaved
a
deep
sigh
which
rumbled
up
from
his
interior
like
the
first
muttering
of
a
cyclone
if
i
known
he
said
regretfully
that
this
guy
was
going
to
turn
out
a
ruddy
englishman
i
have
taken
a
slap
at
him
with
m
stick
and
chanced
it
officer
donahue
considered
the
point
well
taken
ah
he
said
understandingly
he
regarded
archie
with
an
unfriendly
eye
i
know
th
sort
well
trampling
on
th
face
av
th
poor
ya
trample
on
the
poor
man
face
said
officer
cassidy
severely
but
do
be
surprised
if
one
day
he
bites
you
in
the
leg
but
my
dear
old
sir
protested
archie
i
never
trampled
one
of
these
days
said
officer
donahue
moodily
the
shannon
will
flow
in
blood
to
the
sea
absolutely
but
officer
cassidy
uttered
a
glad
cry
why
could
we
hit
him
a
lick
he
suggested
brightly
an
tell
cap
he
resisted
us
in
th
exercise
of
our
jooty
an
instant
gleam
of
approval
and
enthusiasm
came
into
officer
eyes
officer
donahue
was
not
a
man
who
got
these
luminous
inspirations
himself
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
appreciating
them
in
others
and
bestowing
commendation
in
the
right
quarter
there
was
nothing
petty
or
grudging
about
officer
donahue
ye
the
lad
with
the
head
tim
he
exclaimed
admiringly
it
just
sorta
came
to
me
said
cassidy
modestly
it
a
great
idea
timmy
just
happened
to
think
of
it
said
cassidy
with
a
coy
gesture
of
archie
had
listened
to
the
dialogue
with
growing
uneasiness
not
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
made
their
acquaintance
he
became
vividly
aware
of
the
exceptional
physical
gifts
of
these
two
men
the
new
york
police
force
demands
from
those
who
would
join
its
ranks
an
extremely
high
standard
of
stature
and
sinew
but
it
was
obvious
that
jolly
old
donahue
and
cassidy
must
have
passed
in
first
shot
without
any
difficulty
whatever
i
say
you
know
he
observed
apprehensively
and
then
a
sharp
and
commanding
voice
spoke
from
the
outer
room
donahue
cassidy
what
the
devil
does
this
mean
archie
had
a
momentary
impression
that
an
angel
had
fluttered
down
to
his
rescue
if
this
was
the
case
the
angel
had
assumed
an
effective
disguise
that
of
a
police
captain
the
new
arrival
was
a
far
smaller
man
than
his
subordinates
so
much
smaller
that
it
did
archie
good
to
look
at
him
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
wishing
that
it
were
possible
to
rest
his
eyes
with
the
spectacle
of
something
of
a
slightly
less
nature
than
his
two
companions
why
have
you
left
your
posts
the
effect
of
the
interruption
on
the
cassidy
and
donahue
was
pleasingly
instantaneous
they
seemed
to
shrink
to
almost
normal
proportions
and
their
manner
took
on
an
attractive
deference
officer
donahue
saluted
if
ye
plaze
sorr
officer
cassidy
also
saluted
simultaneously
was
like
this
sorr
the
captain
froze
officer
cassidy
with
a
glance
and
leaving
him
congealed
turned
to
officer
donahue
oi
wuz
standing
on
th
sorr
said
officer
donahue
in
a
tone
of
obsequious
respect
which
not
only
delighted
but
astounded
archie
who
had
known
he
could
talk
like
that
accordin
to
instructions
when
i
heard
a
suspicious
noise
i
crope
in
sorr
and
found
this
duck
found
the
accused
sorr
in
front
of
the
mirror
examinin
himself
i
then
called
to
officer
cassidy
for
assistance
we
pinched
arrested
um
the
captain
looked
at
archie
it
seemed
to
archie
that
he
looked
at
him
coldly
and
with
contempt
who
is
he
the
the
what
the
accused
sorr
the
man
that
you
may
want
him
i
do
said
the
captain
archie
though
relieved
thought
he
might
have
put
it
more
nicely
this
is
moon
it
not
a
bit
like
absolutely
not
agreed
archie
cordially
it
all
a
mistake
old
companion
as
i
was
trying
to
cut
it
out
oh
you
seen
the
photographs
at
the
station
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
see
any
resemblance
if
ye
plaze
sorr
said
officer
cassidy
coming
to
life
well
we
thought
he
bin
disguising
himself
the
way
he
would
be
you
a
fool
said
the
captain
yes
sorr
said
officer
cassidy
meekly
so
are
you
yes
archie
respect
for
this
chappie
was
going
up
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
take
years
off
the
lives
of
these
massive
blighters
with
a
word
it
was
like
the
stories
you
read
about
archie
did
not
despair
of
seeing
officer
donahue
and
his
old
college
chum
cassidy
eventually
jumping
through
hoops
who
are
you
demanded
the
captain
turning
to
archie
well
my
name
is
what
are
you
doing
here
well
it
rather
a
longish
story
you
know
do
want
to
bore
you
and
all
i
here
to
listen
you
ca
bore
dashed
nice
of
you
to
put
it
like
that
said
archie
gratefully
i
mean
to
say
makes
it
easier
and
so
forth
what
i
mean
is
you
know
how
rotten
you
feel
telling
the
deuce
of
a
long
yarn
and
wondering
if
the
party
of
the
second
part
is
wishing
you
would
turn
off
the
tap
and
go
home
i
mean
if
said
the
captain
you
reciting
something
stop
if
trying
to
tell
me
what
you
doing
here
make
it
shorter
and
archie
saw
his
point
of
course
time
was
money
the
modern
spirit
of
hustle
all
that
sort
of
thing
well
it
was
this
bathing
suit
you
know
he
said
what
bathing
suit
mine
do
you
know
a
contrivance
rather
bright
and
so
forth
but
in
its
proper
place
not
altogether
a
bad
egg
well
the
whole
thing
started
you
know
with
my
standing
on
a
bally
pedestal
sort
of
arrangement
in
a
diving
attitude
for
the
cover
you
know
i
know
if
you
have
ever
done
anything
of
that
kind
yourself
but
it
gives
you
a
most
fearful
crick
in
the
spine
however
that
rather
beside
the
point
i
suppose
do
know
why
i
mentioned
it
well
this
morning
he
was
dashed
late
so
i
went
out
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
archie
looked
at
him
surprised
are
i
making
it
clear
well
you
understand
about
the
bathing
suit
do
you
the
jolly
old
bathing
suit
you
grasped
that
what
oh
i
say
said
archie
that
rather
a
nuisance
i
mean
to
say
the
bathing
suit
what
you
might
call
the
good
old
pivot
of
the
whole
dashed
affair
you
see
well
you
understand
about
the
cover
what
you
pretty
clear
on
the
subject
of
the
cover
what
cover
why
for
the
what
magazine
now
there
you
rather
have
me
one
of
these
bright
little
periodicals
you
know
that
you
see
popping
to
and
fro
on
the
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
the
captain
he
looked
at
archie
with
an
expression
of
distrust
and
hostility
and
i
tell
you
straight
out
i
do
like
the
looks
of
you
i
believe
you
a
pal
of
no
longer
said
archie
firmly
i
mean
to
say
a
chappie
who
makes
you
stand
on
a
bally
pedestal
sort
of
arrangement
and
get
a
crick
in
the
spine
and
then
does
turn
up
and
leaves
you
biffing
all
over
the
countryside
in
a
bathing
suit
the
reintroduction
of
the
bathing
suit
motive
seemed
to
have
the
worst
effect
on
the
captain
he
flushed
darkly
are
you
trying
to
josh
me
i
a
mind
to
soak
you
if
ye
plaze
sorr
cried
officer
donahue
and
officer
cassidy
in
chorus
in
the
course
of
their
professional
career
they
did
not
often
hear
their
superior
make
many
suggestions
with
which
they
saw
eye
to
eye
but
he
had
certainly
in
their
opinion
spoken
a
mouthful
now
no
honestly
my
dear
old
thing
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
he
would
have
spoken
further
but
at
this
moment
the
world
came
to
an
end
at
least
that
was
how
it
sounded
somewhere
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
something
went
off
with
a
vast
explosion
shattering
the
glass
in
the
window
peeling
the
plaster
from
the
ceiling
and
sending
him
staggering
into
the
inhospitable
arms
of
officer
donahue
the
three
guardians
of
the
law
stared
at
one
another
if
ye
plaze
sorr
said
officer
cassidy
saluting
well
may
i
spake
sorr
well
something
exploded
sorr
the
information
kindly
meant
though
it
was
seemed
to
annoy
the
captain
what
the
devil
did
you
think
i
thought
had
happened
he
demanded
with
not
a
little
irritation
it
was
a
bomb
archie
could
have
corrected
this
diagnosis
for
already
a
faint
but
appealing
aroma
of
an
alcoholic
nature
was
creeping
into
the
room
through
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
there
had
risen
before
his
eyes
the
picture
of
j
wheeler
affectionately
regarding
that
barrel
of
his
on
the
previous
morning
in
the
studio
upstairs
j
wheeler
had
wanted
quick
results
and
he
had
got
them
archie
had
long
since
ceased
to
regard
j
wheeler
as
anything
but
a
tumour
on
the
social
system
but
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
he
had
certainly
done
him
a
good
turn
now
already
these
honest
men
diverted
by
the
superior
attraction
of
this
latest
happening
appeared
to
have
forgotten
his
existence
sorr
said
officer
donahue
well
it
came
from
upstairs
of
course
it
came
from
upstairs
cassidy
sorr
get
down
into
the
street
call
up
the
reserves
and
stand
at
the
front
entrance
to
keep
the
crowd
back
we
have
the
whole
city
here
in
five
right
do
let
anyone
no
well
see
that
you
do
come
along
donahue
now
look
on
the
spot
sorr
said
officer
donahue
a
moment
later
archie
had
the
studio
to
himself
two
minutes
later
he
was
picking
his
way
cautiously
down
the
after
the
manner
of
the
recent
mr
moon
archie
had
not
seen
much
of
mr
moon
but
he
had
seen
enough
to
know
that
in
certain
crises
his
methods
were
sound
and
should
be
followed
elmer
moon
was
not
a
good
man
his
ethics
were
poor
and
his
moral
code
shaky
but
in
the
matter
of
legging
it
away
from
a
situation
of
peril
and
discomfort
he
had
no
superior
chapter
vii
roscoe
sherriff
has
an
idea
archie
inserted
a
fresh
cigarette
in
his
long
holder
and
began
to
smoke
a
little
moodily
it
was
about
a
week
after
his
disturbing
adventures
in
j
wheeler
studio
and
life
had
ceased
for
the
moment
to
be
a
thing
of
careless
enjoyment
wheeler
mourning
over
his
lost
and
refusing
like
niobe
to
be
comforted
has
suspended
the
sittings
for
the
magazine
cover
thus
robbing
archie
of
his
brewster
had
not
been
in
genial
mood
of
late
and
in
addition
to
all
this
lucille
was
away
on
a
visit
to
a
and
when
lucille
went
away
she
took
with
her
the
sunshine
archie
was
not
surprised
at
her
being
popular
and
in
demand
among
her
friends
but
that
did
not
help
him
to
become
reconciled
to
her
absence
he
gazed
rather
wistfully
across
the
table
at
his
friend
roscoe
sherriff
the
another
of
his
club
acquaintances
they
had
just
finished
lunch
and
during
the
meal
sherriff
who
like
most
men
of
action
was
fond
of
hearing
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
liked
exercising
it
on
the
subject
of
himself
had
been
telling
archie
a
few
anecdotes
about
his
professional
past
from
these
the
latter
had
conceived
a
picture
of
roscoe
sherriff
life
as
a
prismatic
thing
of
energy
and
adventure
and
withal
just
the
sort
of
life
in
fact
which
he
would
have
enjoyed
leading
himself
he
wished
that
he
too
like
the
could
go
about
the
place
slipping
things
over
and
putting
things
daniel
brewster
he
felt
would
have
beamed
upon
a
like
roscoe
sherriff
the
more
i
see
of
america
sighed
archie
the
more
it
amazes
me
all
you
birds
seem
to
have
been
doing
things
from
the
cradle
upwards
i
wish
i
could
do
things
well
why
do
you
archie
flicked
the
ash
from
his
cigarette
into
the
oh
i
do
know
you
know
he
said
somehow
none
of
our
family
ever
have
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
whenever
a
moffam
starts
out
to
do
things
he
infallibly
makes
a
bloomer
there
was
a
moffam
in
the
middle
ages
who
had
a
sudden
spasm
of
energy
and
set
out
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
dressed
as
a
wandering
friar
rum
ideas
they
had
in
those
did
he
get
there
absolutely
not
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
front
door
his
favourite
hound
mistook
him
for
a
tramp
or
a
varlet
or
a
scurvy
knave
or
whatever
they
used
to
call
them
at
that
time
and
bit
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
well
at
least
he
enough
to
make
a
chappie
start
what
roscoe
sherriff
sipped
his
coffee
thoughtfully
he
was
an
apostle
of
energy
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
make
a
convert
of
archie
and
incidentally
do
himself
a
bit
of
good
for
several
days
he
had
been
looking
for
someone
like
archie
to
help
him
in
a
small
matter
which
he
had
in
mind
if
you
really
keen
on
doing
things
he
said
there
something
you
can
do
for
me
right
archie
beamed
action
was
what
his
soul
demanded
anything
dear
boy
anything
state
your
case
would
you
have
any
objection
to
putting
up
a
snake
for
me
putting
up
a
snake
just
for
a
day
or
but
how
do
you
mean
old
soul
put
him
up
where
wherever
you
live
where
do
you
live
the
cosmopolis
is
it
of
course
you
married
old
brewster
daughter
i
remember
reading
about
but
i
say
laddie
i
do
want
to
spoil
your
day
and
disappoint
you
and
so
forth
but
my
jolly
old
would
never
let
me
keep
a
snake
why
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
make
him
let
me
stop
on
in
the
he
would
there
not
much
that
goes
on
in
the
hotel
that
he
does
know
said
archie
doubtfully
he
must
know
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
is
that
it
must
be
a
dead
archie
flicked
some
more
ash
into
the
i
do
seem
absolutely
to
have
grasped
the
affair
in
all
its
aspects
if
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
i
mean
to
say
in
the
first
place
why
would
it
brighten
your
young
existence
if
i
entertained
this
snake
of
yours
it
not
mine
it
belongs
to
mme
brudowska
you
heard
of
her
of
course
oh
yes
she
some
sort
of
performing
snake
female
in
vaudeville
or
something
is
she
or
something
of
that
species
or
order
you
near
it
but
not
quite
right
she
is
the
leading
exponent
of
tragedy
on
any
stage
in
the
civilized
absolutely
i
remember
now
my
wife
lugged
me
to
see
her
perform
one
night
it
all
comes
back
to
me
she
had
me
wedged
in
an
before
i
knew
what
i
was
up
against
and
then
it
was
too
late
i
remember
reading
in
some
journal
or
other
that
she
had
a
pet
snake
given
her
by
some
russian
prince
or
other
what
that
said
sherriff
was
the
impression
i
intended
to
convey
when
i
sent
the
story
to
the
papers
i
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
bought
name
down
on
the
east
side
i
always
believe
in
animals
for
stunts
i
nearly
always
had
good
results
but
with
her
nibs
i
handicapped
shackled
so
to
speak
you
might
almost
say
my
genius
is
stifled
or
strangled
if
you
prefer
anything
you
say
agreed
archie
courteously
but
how
why
is
your
she
keeps
me
on
a
leash
she
wo
let
me
do
anything
with
a
kick
in
it
if
i
suggested
one
stunt
i
suggested
twenty
and
every
time
she
turns
them
down
on
the
ground
that
that
sort
of
thing
is
beneath
the
dignity
of
an
artist
in
her
position
it
does
give
a
fellow
a
chance
so
now
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
her
good
by
stealth
i
going
to
steal
her
steal
it
pinch
it
as
it
were
yes
big
story
for
the
papers
you
see
she
grown
very
much
attached
to
peter
he
her
mascot
i
believe
she
practically
kidded
herself
into
believing
that
russian
prince
story
if
i
can
sneak
it
away
and
keep
it
away
for
a
day
or
two
she
do
the
rest
she
make
such
a
fuss
that
the
papers
will
be
full
of
i
wow
any
ordinary
woman
would
work
in
with
me
but
not
her
nibs
she
would
call
it
cheap
and
degrading
and
a
lot
of
other
things
it
got
to
be
a
genuine
steal
and
if
i
caught
at
it
i
lose
my
job
so
where
you
come
but
where
am
i
to
keep
the
jolly
old
reptile
oh
anywhere
punch
a
few
holes
in
a
and
make
it
up
a
shakedown
inside
it
be
company
for
something
in
that
my
wife
away
just
now
and
it
a
bit
lonely
in
the
you
never
be
lonely
with
peter
around
he
a
great
scout
always
merry
and
he
does
bite
i
suppose
or
sting
or
he
may
occasionally
it
depends
on
the
weather
but
outside
of
that
he
as
harmless
as
a
dashed
dangerous
things
canaries
said
archie
thoughtfully
they
peck
at
do
weaken
pleaded
the
oh
all
right
i
take
him
by
the
way
touching
the
matter
of
browsing
and
sluicing
what
do
i
feed
him
on
oh
anything
or
fruit
or
egg
or
or
you
know
anything
you
have
yourself
well
i
much
obliged
for
your
hospitality
i
do
the
same
for
you
another
time
now
i
must
be
getting
along
to
see
to
the
practical
end
of
the
thing
by
the
way
her
nibs
lives
at
the
cosmopolis
too
very
convenient
well
so
long
see
you
archie
left
alone
began
for
the
first
time
to
have
serious
doubts
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
swayed
by
sherriff
magnetic
personality
but
now
that
the
other
had
removed
himself
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
been
entirely
wise
to
lend
his
sympathy
and
to
the
scheme
he
had
never
had
intimate
dealings
with
a
snake
before
but
he
had
kept
silkworms
as
a
child
and
there
had
been
the
deuce
of
a
lot
of
fuss
and
unpleasantness
over
them
getting
into
the
salad
and
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
he
was
asking
for
trouble
with
a
loud
voice
but
he
had
given
his
word
and
he
supposed
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
it
he
lit
another
cigarette
and
wandered
out
into
fifth
avenue
his
usually
smooth
brow
was
ruffled
with
care
despite
the
eulogies
which
sherriff
had
uttered
concerning
peter
he
found
his
doubts
increasing
peter
might
as
the
had
stated
be
a
great
scout
but
was
his
little
garden
of
eden
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
cosmopolis
hotel
likely
to
be
improved
by
the
advent
of
even
the
most
amiable
and
winsome
of
serpents
however
moffam
my
dear
fellow
the
voice
speaking
suddenly
in
his
ear
from
behind
roused
archie
from
his
reflections
indeed
it
roused
him
so
effectually
that
he
jumped
a
clear
inch
off
the
ground
and
bit
his
tongue
revolving
on
his
axis
he
found
himself
confronting
a
man
with
a
face
like
a
horse
the
man
was
dressed
in
something
of
an
style
his
clothes
had
an
english
cut
he
had
a
drooping
grey
moustache
he
also
wore
a
grey
bowler
hat
flattened
at
the
crown
but
who
are
we
to
judge
him
archie
moffam
i
have
been
trying
to
find
you
all
the
archie
had
placed
him
now
he
had
not
seen
general
mannister
for
several
years
not
indeed
since
the
days
when
he
used
to
meet
him
at
the
home
of
young
lord
seacliff
his
nephew
archie
had
been
at
eton
and
oxford
with
seacliff
and
had
often
visited
him
in
the
long
vacation
halloa
general
what
ho
what
ho
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
over
here
let
get
out
of
this
crush
my
general
mannister
steered
archie
into
a
that
he
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
as
if
embarrassed
i
brought
seacliff
over
he
said
finally
dear
old
squiffy
here
oh
i
say
great
work
general
mannister
did
not
seem
to
share
his
enthusiasm
he
looked
like
a
horse
with
a
secret
sorrow
he
coughed
three
times
like
a
horse
who
in
addition
to
a
secret
sorrow
had
contracted
asthma
you
will
find
seacliff
changed
he
said
let
me
see
how
long
is
it
since
you
and
he
met
archie
reflected
i
was
demobbed
just
about
a
year
ago
i
saw
him
in
paris
about
a
year
before
that
the
old
egg
got
a
bit
of
shrapnel
in
his
foot
or
something
did
he
anyhow
i
remember
he
was
sent
his
foot
is
perfectly
well
again
now
but
unfortunately
the
enforced
inaction
led
to
disastrous
results
you
recollect
no
doubt
that
seacliff
always
had
a
a
tendency
a
a
weakness
it
was
a
family
failing
mopping
it
up
do
you
mean
shifting
it
looking
on
the
jolly
old
stuff
when
it
was
red
and
what
not
what
archie
nodded
dear
old
squiffy
was
always
lad
for
the
when
i
met
him
in
paris
i
remember
he
was
quite
tolerably
precisely
and
the
failing
has
i
regret
to
say
grown
on
him
since
he
returned
from
the
war
my
poor
sister
was
extremely
worried
in
fact
to
cut
a
long
story
short
i
induced
him
to
accompany
me
to
america
i
am
attached
to
the
british
legation
in
washington
now
you
oh
really
i
wished
seacliff
to
come
with
me
to
washington
but
he
insists
on
remaining
in
new
york
he
stated
specifically
that
the
thought
of
living
in
washington
gave
him
the
what
was
the
expression
he
used
the
pip
the
pip
but
what
was
the
idea
of
bringing
him
to
america
this
admirable
prohibition
enactment
has
rendered
america
to
my
mind
the
ideal
place
for
a
young
man
of
his
the
general
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
most
fortunate
that
i
happened
to
run
into
you
my
dear
fellow
my
train
for
washington
leaves
in
another
hour
and
i
have
packing
to
do
i
want
to
leave
poor
seacliff
in
your
charge
while
i
am
oh
i
say
what
you
can
look
after
him
i
am
credibly
informed
that
even
now
there
are
places
in
new
york
where
a
determined
young
man
may
obtain
the
er
stuff
and
i
should
be
infinitely
obliged
and
my
poor
sister
would
be
infinitely
grateful
if
you
would
keep
an
eye
on
he
hailed
a
i
am
sending
seacliff
round
to
the
cosmopolis
i
am
sure
you
will
do
everything
you
can
my
boy
archie
continued
his
walk
this
he
felt
was
beginning
to
be
a
bit
thick
he
smiled
a
bitter
mirthless
smile
as
he
recalled
the
fact
that
less
than
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
he
had
expressed
a
regret
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
ranks
of
those
who
do
things
fate
since
then
had
certainly
supplied
him
with
jobs
with
a
lavish
hand
by
he
would
be
an
active
accomplice
to
a
theft
valet
and
companion
to
a
snake
he
had
never
met
and
as
far
as
could
gather
the
scope
of
his
duties
a
combination
of
nursemaid
and
private
detective
to
dear
old
squiffy
it
was
past
four
when
he
returned
to
the
cosmopolis
roscoe
sherriff
was
pacing
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
nervously
carrying
a
small
here
you
are
at
last
good
heavens
man
i
been
waiting
two
sorry
old
bean
i
was
musing
a
bit
and
lost
track
of
the
the
looked
cautiously
round
there
was
nobody
within
earshot
here
he
is
he
said
who
where
said
archie
staring
blankly
in
this
bag
did
you
expect
to
find
him
strolling
with
me
round
the
lobby
here
you
are
take
him
he
was
gone
and
archie
holding
the
bag
made
his
way
to
the
lift
the
bag
squirmed
gently
in
his
grip
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
lift
was
a
woman
of
foreign
appearance
dressed
in
a
way
that
made
archie
feel
that
she
must
be
somebody
or
she
could
look
like
that
her
face
too
seemed
vaguely
familiar
she
entered
the
lift
at
the
second
floor
where
the
is
and
she
had
the
contented
expression
of
one
who
had
to
her
satisfaction
she
got
off
at
the
same
floor
as
archie
and
walked
swiftly
in
a
lithe
pantherist
way
round
the
bend
in
the
corridor
archie
followed
more
slowly
when
he
reached
the
door
of
his
room
the
passage
was
empty
he
inserted
the
key
in
his
door
turned
it
pushed
the
door
open
and
pocketed
the
key
he
was
about
to
enter
when
the
bag
again
squirmed
gently
in
his
grip
from
the
days
of
pandora
through
the
epoch
of
bluebeard
wife
down
to
the
present
time
one
of
the
chief
failings
of
humanity
has
been
the
disposition
to
open
things
that
were
better
closed
it
would
have
been
simple
for
archie
to
have
taken
another
step
and
put
a
door
between
himself
and
the
world
but
there
came
to
him
the
irresistible
desire
to
peep
into
the
bag
now
not
three
seconds
later
but
now
all
the
way
up
in
the
lift
he
had
been
battling
with
the
temptation
and
now
he
succumbed
the
bag
was
one
of
those
simple
bags
with
a
thingummy
which
you
press
archie
pressed
it
and
as
it
opened
out
popped
the
head
of
peter
his
eyes
met
archie
over
his
head
there
seemed
to
be
an
invisible
mark
of
interrogation
his
gaze
was
curious
but
kindly
he
appeared
to
be
saying
to
himself
have
i
found
a
friend
serpents
or
snakes
says
the
encyclopaedia
are
reptiles
of
the
saurian
class
ophidia
characterised
by
an
elongated
cylindrical
limbless
scaly
form
and
distinguished
from
lizards
by
the
fact
that
the
halves
rami
of
the
lower
jaw
are
not
solidly
united
at
the
chin
but
movably
connected
by
an
elastic
ligament
the
vertebra
are
very
numerous
gastrocentrous
and
procoelous
and
of
course
when
they
put
it
like
that
you
can
see
at
once
that
a
man
might
spend
hours
with
combined
entertainment
and
profit
just
looking
at
a
snake
archie
would
no
doubt
have
done
this
but
long
before
he
had
time
really
to
inspect
the
halves
rami
of
his
new
friend
lower
jaw
and
to
admire
its
elastic
fittings
and
long
before
the
gastrocentrous
and
procoelous
character
of
the
other
vertebrae
had
made
any
real
impression
on
him
a
piercing
scream
almost
at
his
elbow
startled
him
out
of
his
scientific
reverie
a
door
opposite
had
opened
and
the
woman
of
the
elevator
was
standing
staring
at
him
with
an
expression
of
horror
and
fury
that
went
through
him
like
a
knife
it
was
the
expression
which
more
than
anything
else
had
made
mme
brudowska
what
she
was
professionally
combined
with
a
deep
voice
and
a
sinuous
walk
it
enabled
her
to
draw
down
a
matter
of
a
thousand
dollars
per
week
indeed
though
the
fact
gave
him
little
pleasure
archie
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
at
this
moment
getting
about
including
two
dollars
and
cents
worth
of
the
great
emotional
star
for
nothing
for
having
treated
him
gratis
to
the
look
of
horror
and
fury
she
now
moved
towards
him
with
the
sinuous
walk
and
spoke
in
the
tone
which
she
seldom
permitted
herself
to
use
before
the
curtain
of
act
two
unless
there
was
a
whale
of
a
situation
that
called
for
it
in
act
one
thief
it
was
the
way
she
said
it
archie
staggered
backwards
as
though
he
had
been
hit
between
the
eyes
fell
through
the
open
door
of
his
room
kicked
it
to
with
a
flying
foot
and
collapsed
on
the
bed
peter
the
snake
who
had
fallen
on
the
floor
with
a
squashy
sound
looked
surprised
and
pained
for
a
moment
then
being
a
philosopher
at
heart
cheered
up
and
began
hunting
for
flies
under
the
bureau
chapter
viii
a
disturbed
night
for
dear
old
squiffy
peril
sharpens
the
intellect
archie
mind
as
a
rule
worked
in
rather
a
languid
and
restful
sort
of
way
but
now
it
got
going
with
a
rush
and
a
whir
he
glared
round
the
room
he
had
never
seen
a
room
so
devoid
of
satisfactory
cover
and
then
there
came
to
him
a
scheme
a
ruse
it
offered
a
chance
of
escape
it
was
indeed
a
bit
of
all
right
peter
the
snake
loafing
contentedly
about
the
carpet
found
himself
seized
by
what
the
encyclopaedia
calls
the
distensible
gullet
and
looked
up
reproachfully
the
next
moment
he
was
in
his
bag
again
and
archie
bounding
silently
into
the
bathroom
was
tearing
the
cord
off
his
there
came
a
banging
at
the
door
a
voice
spoke
sternly
a
masculine
voice
this
time
say
open
this
door
archie
rapidly
attached
the
cord
to
the
handle
of
the
bag
leaped
to
the
window
opened
it
tied
the
cord
to
a
projecting
piece
of
iron
on
the
sill
lowered
peter
and
the
bag
into
the
depths
and
closed
the
window
again
the
whole
affair
took
but
a
few
seconds
generals
have
received
the
thanks
of
their
nations
for
displaying
less
resource
on
the
field
of
battle
he
opened
outside
stood
the
bereaved
woman
and
beside
her
a
gentleman
with
a
bowler
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
in
whom
archie
recognised
the
hotel
detective
the
hotel
detective
also
recognised
archie
and
the
stern
cast
of
his
features
relaxed
he
even
smiled
a
rusty
but
propitiatory
smile
he
imagined
erroneously
that
archie
being
the
of
the
owner
of
the
hotel
had
a
pull
with
that
gentleman
and
he
resolved
to
proceed
warily
lest
he
jeopardise
his
job
why
moffam
he
said
apologetically
i
did
know
it
was
you
i
was
always
glad
to
have
a
chat
said
archie
cordially
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
my
snake
cried
the
queen
of
tragedy
where
is
my
snake
archie
looked
at
the
detective
the
detective
looked
at
archie
this
lady
said
the
detective
with
a
dry
little
cough
thinks
her
snake
is
in
your
room
snake
snake
what
the
lady
my
snake
my
peter
mme
brudowska
voice
shook
with
emotion
he
is
here
here
in
this
archie
shook
his
head
no
snakes

absolutely
not
i
remember
noticing
when
i
came
the
snake

here
here
in
this
room
this
man

it
in
a
bag
i
saw
him

is
a
thief
easy
protested
the
detective
go
easy
this
gentleman

the
boss
i
care
not
who
he
is

my
snake
here
here
in
this
room
mr
moffam
would
go
round

archie

a
snake
in
my
life
none
of
the
moffams
have
ever
gone
about
stealing
snakes
regular
family
tradition
though
i
once
had
an
uncle
who
kept
here
he
is
here
my
peter
archie
looked
at
the
detective
the
detective
looked
at
archie
we
must
humour
her
their
glances
said
of
course
said
archie
if
you
like
to
search
the
room
what
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this
is
liberty
hall
everybody
welcome

the
kiddies
i
will
search
the
room
said
mme
brudowska
the
detective
glanced
apologetically
at
archie
do
blame
me
for
this
moffam
he
urged
rather
not
only
too
glad
you
dropped
in
he
took
up
an
easy
attitude
against
the
window
and
watched
the
empress
of
the
emotional
drama
explore
presently
she
desisted
baffled
for
an
instant
she
paused
as
though
about
to
speak
then
swept
from
the
room
a
moment
later
a
door
banged
across
the
passage
how
do
they
get
that
way
queried
the
detective
well
moffam
sorry
to
have
butted
the
door
closed
archie
waited
a
few
moments
then
went
to
the
window
and
hauled
in
the
slack
presently
the
bag
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
good
god
said
archie
in
the
rush
and
swirl
of
recent
events
he
must
have
omitted
to
see
that
the
clasp
that
fastened
the
bag
was
properly
closed
for
the
bag
as
it
jumped
on
to
the
gaped
at
him
like
a
yawning
face
and
inside
it
there
was
nothing
archie
leaned
as
far
out
of
the
window
as
he
could
manage
without
committing
suicide
far
below
him
the
traffic
took
its
usual
course
and
the
pedestrians
moved
to
and
fro
upon
the
pavements
there
was
no
crowding
no
excitement
yet
only
a
few
moments
before
a
long
green
snake
with
three
hundred
ribs
a
distensible
gullet
and
gastrocentrous
vertebras
must
have
descended
on
that
street
like
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
and
nobody
seemed
even
interested
not
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
arrived
in
america
archie
marvelled
at
the
cynical
detachment
of
the
new
yorker
who
permits
himself
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
he
shut
the
window
and
moved
away
with
a
heavy
heart
he
had
not
had
the
pleasure
of
an
extended
acquaintanceship
with
peter
but
he
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
realise
his
sterling
qualities
somewhere
beneath
peter
three
hundred
ribs
there
had
lain
a
heart
of
gold
and
archie
mourned
for
his
loss
archie
had
a
dinner
and
theatre
engagement
that
night
and
it
was
late
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
he
found
his
prowling
restlessly
about
the
lobby
there
seemed
to
be
something
on
brewster
mind
he
came
up
to
archie
with
a
brooding
frown
on
his
square
face
who
this
man
seacliff
he
demanded
without
preamble
i
hear
he
a
friend
of
oh
you
met
him
what
said
archie
had
a
nice
little
chat
together
yes
talked
of
this
and
that
no
we
have
not
said
a
word
to
each
really
oh
well
dear
old
squiffy
is
one
of
those
strong
silent
fellers
you
know
you
must
mind
if
he
a
bit
dumb
he
never
says
much
but
it
whispered
round
the
clubs
that
he
thinks
a
lot
it
was
rumoured
in
the
spring
of
that
squiffy
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
bright
remark
but
it
never
came
to
brewster
struggled
with
his
feelings
who
is
he
you
seem
to
know
oh
yes
great
pal
of
mine
squiffy
we
went
through
eton
oxford
and
the
bankruptcy
court
together
and
here
a
rummy
coincidence
when
they
examined
me
i
had
no
assets
and
when
they
examined
squiffy
he
had
no
assets
rather
extraordinary
what
brewster
seemed
to
be
in
no
mood
for
discussing
coincidences
i
might
have
known
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
he
said
bitterly
well
if
you
want
to
see
him
you
have
to
do
it
outside
my
why
i
thought
he
was
stopping
he
is
he
can
look
for
some
other
hotel
to
break
great
scot
has
dear
old
squiffy
been
breaking
the
place
up
brewster
snorted
i
am
informed
that
this
precious
friend
of
yours
entered
my
at
eight
he
must
have
been
completely
intoxicated
though
the
head
waiter
tells
me
he
noticed
nothing
at
the
archie
nodded
approvingly
dear
old
squiffy
was
always
like
that
it
a
gift
however
woozled
he
might
be
it
was
impossible
to
detect
it
with
the
naked
eye
i
seen
the
dear
old
chap
many
a
time
whiffled
to
the
eyebrows
and
looking
as
sober
as
a
bishop
soberer
when
did
it
begin
to
dawn
on
the
lads
in
the
that
the
old
egg
had
been
pushing
the
boat
out
the
head
waiter
said
brewster
with
cold
fury
tells
me
that
he
got
a
hint
of
the
man
condition
when
he
suddenly
got
up
from
his
table
and
went
the
round
of
the
room
pulling
off
all
the
and
breaking
everything
that
was
on
them
he
then
threw
a
number
of
rolls
at
the
diners
and
left
he
seems
to
have
gone
straight
to
dashed
sensible
of
him
what
sound
practical
chap
squiffy
but
where
on
earth
did
he
get
the
er
materials
from
his
room
i
made
enquiries
he
has
six
large
cases
in
his
squiffy
always
was
a
chap
of
infinite
resource
well
i
dashed
sorry
this
should
have
happened
do
you
if
it
had
been
for
you
the
man
would
never
have
come
brewster
brooded
coldly
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
ever
since
you
came
to
this
hotel
i
had
nothing
but
dashed
sorry
said
archie
sympathetically
grrh
said
brewster
archie
made
his
way
meditatively
to
the
lift
the
injustice
of
his
attitude
pained
him
it
was
absolutely
rotten
and
all
that
to
be
blamed
for
everything
that
went
wrong
in
the
hotel
cosmopolis
while
this
conversation
was
in
progress
lord
seacliff
was
enjoying
a
refreshing
sleep
in
his
room
on
the
fourth
floor
two
hours
passed
the
noise
of
the
traffic
in
the
street
below
faded
away
only
the
rattle
of
an
occasional
belated
cab
broke
the
silence
in
the
hotel
all
was
still
brewster
had
gone
to
bed
archie
in
his
room
smoked
meditatively
peace
may
have
been
said
to
reign
at
two
lord
seacliff
awoke
his
hours
of
slumber
were
always
irregular
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
switched
the
light
on
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
hot
brown
eye
he
yawned
and
stretched
himself
his
head
was
aching
a
little
the
room
seemed
to
him
a
trifle
close
he
got
out
of
bed
and
threw
open
the
window
then
returning
to
bed
he
picked
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
he
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
little
jumpy
and
reading
generally
sent
him
to
sleep
much
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
the
general
consensus
of
opinion
is
that
a
gentle
story
makes
the
best
opiate
if
this
be
so
dear
old
squiffy
choice
of
literature
had
been
rather
injudicious
his
book
was
the
adventures
of
sherlock
holmes
and
the
particular
story
which
he
selected
for
perusal
was
the
one
entitled
the
speckled
he
was
not
a
great
reader
but
when
he
read
he
liked
something
with
a
bit
of
zip
to
it
squiffy
became
absorbed
he
had
read
the
story
before
but
a
long
time
back
and
its
complications
were
fresh
to
him
the
tale
it
may
be
remembered
deals
with
the
activities
of
an
ingenious
gentleman
who
kept
a
snake
and
used
to
loose
it
into
people
bedrooms
as
a
preliminary
to
collecting
on
their
insurance
it
gave
squiffy
pleasant
thrills
for
he
had
always
had
a
particular
horror
of
snakes
as
a
child
he
had
shrunk
from
visiting
the
serpent
house
at
the
zoo
and
later
when
he
had
come
to
man
estate
and
had
put
off
childish
things
and
settled
down
in
real
earnest
to
his
mission
of
drinking
up
all
the
alcoholic
fluid
in
england
the
distaste
for
ophidia
had
lingered
to
a
dislike
for
real
snakes
had
been
added
a
maturer
shrinking
from
those
which
existed
only
in
his
imagination
he
could
still
recall
his
emotions
on
the
occasion
scarcely
three
months
before
when
he
had
seen
a
long
green
serpent
which
a
majority
of
his
contemporaries
had
assured
him
was
there
squiffy
read
on
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible
a
very
gentle
soothing
sound
like
that
of
a
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continuously
from
a
lord
seacliff
looked
up
from
his
book
with
a
start
imagination
was
beginning
to
play
him
tricks
he
could
have
sworn
that
he
had
actually
heard
that
identical
sound
it
had
seemed
to
come
from
the
window
he
listened
again
no
all
was
still
he
returned
to
his
book
and
went
on
reading
it
was
a
singular
sight
that
met
our
eyes
beside
the
table
on
a
wooden
chair
sat
doctor
grimesby
rylott
clad
in
a
long
his
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
dreadful
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
round
his
brow
he
had
a
peculiar
yellow
band
with
brownish
speckles
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
i
took
a
step
forward
in
an
instant
his
strange
began
to
move
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
head
and
puffed
neck
of
a
loathsome
serpent
ugh
said
squiffy
he
closed
the
book
and
put
it
down
his
head
was
aching
worse
than
ever
he
wished
now
that
he
had
read
something
else
no
fellow
could
read
himself
to
sleep
with
this
sort
of
thing
people
ought
not
to
write
this
sort
of
thing
his
heart
gave
a
bound
there
it
was
again
that
hissing
sound
and
this
time
he
was
sure
it
came
from
the
window
he
looked
at
the
window
and
remained
staring
frozen
over
the
sill
with
a
graceful
leisurely
movement
a
green
snake
was
crawling
as
it
crawled
it
raised
its
head
and
peered
from
side
to
side
like
a
shortsighted
man
looking
for
his
spectacles
it
hesitated
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
sill
then
wriggled
to
the
floor
and
began
to
cross
the
room
squiffy
stared
on
it
would
have
pained
peter
deeply
for
he
was
a
snake
of
great
sensibility
if
he
had
known
how
much
his
entrance
had
disturbed
the
occupant
of
the
room
he
himself
had
no
feeling
but
gratitude
for
the
man
who
had
opened
the
window
and
so
enabled
him
to
get
in
out
of
the
rather
nippy
night
air
ever
since
the
bag
had
swung
open
and
shot
him
out
onto
the
sill
of
the
window
below
archie
he
had
been
waiting
patiently
for
something
of
the
kind
to
happen
he
was
a
snake
who
took
things
as
they
came
and
was
prepared
to
rough
it
a
bit
if
necessary
but
for
the
last
hour
or
two
he
had
been
hoping
that
somebody
would
do
something
practical
in
the
way
of
getting
him
in
out
of
the
cold
when
at
home
he
had
an
eiderdown
quilt
to
sleep
on
and
the
stone
of
the
was
a
little
trying
to
a
snake
of
regular
habits
he
crawled
thankfully
across
the
floor
under
squiffy
bed
there
was
a
pair
of
trousers
there
for
his
host
had
undressed
when
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
fold
his
clothes
neatly
and
place
them
upon
a
chair
peter
looked
the
trousers
over
they
were
not
an
eiderdown
quilt
but
they
would
serve
he
curled
up
in
them
and
went
to
sleep
he
had
had
an
exciting
day
and
was
glad
to
turn
in
after
about
ten
minutes
the
tension
of
squiffy
attitude
relaxed
his
heart
which
had
seemed
to
suspend
its
operations
began
beating
again
reason
reasserted
itself
he
peeped
cautiously
under
the
bed
he
could
see
nothing
squiffy
was
convinced
he
told
himself
that
he
had
never
really
believed
in
peter
as
a
living
thing
it
stood
to
reason
that
there
really
be
a
snake
in
his
room
the
window
looked
out
on
emptiness
his
room
was
several
stories
above
the
ground
there
was
a
stern
set
expression
on
squiffy
face
as
he
climbed
out
of
bed
it
was
the
expression
of
a
man
who
is
turning
over
a
new
leaf
starting
a
new
life
he
looked
about
the
room
for
some
implement
which
would
carry
out
the
deed
he
had
to
do
and
finally
pulled
out
one
of
the
using
this
as
a
lever
he
broke
open
the
topmost
of
the
six
cases
which
stood
in
the
corner
the
soft
wood
cracked
and
split
squiffy
drew
out
a
bottle
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
at
it
as
a
man
might
gaze
at
a
friend
on
the
point
of
death
then
with
a
sudden
determination
he
went
into
the
bathroom
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
and
a
gurgling
sound
half
an
hour
later
the
telephone
in
archie
room
rang
i
say
archie
old
top
said
the
voice
of
squiffy
halloa
old
bean
is
that
you
i
say
could
you
pop
down
here
for
a
second
i
rather
absolutely
which
room
i
be
with
you
eftsoons
or
right
thanks
old
what
appears
to
be
the
difficulty
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
thought
i
saw
a
snake
a
snake
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
come
archie
found
lord
seacliff
seated
on
his
bed
an
arresting
aroma
of
mixed
drinks
pervaded
the
atmosphere
i
say
what
said
archie
inhaling
that
all
right
i
been
pouring
my
stock
away
just
finished
the
last
but
why
i
told
you
i
thought
i
saw
a
snake
green
squiffy
shivered
slightly
frightfully
green
archie
hesitated
he
perceived
that
there
are
moments
when
silence
is
the
best
policy
he
had
been
worrying
himself
over
the
unfortunate
case
of
his
friend
and
now
that
fate
seemed
to
have
provided
a
solution
it
would
be
rash
to
interfere
merely
to
ease
the
old
bean
mind
if
squiffy
was
going
to
reform
because
he
thought
he
had
seen
an
imaginary
snake
better
not
to
let
him
know
that
the
snake
was
a
real
one
dashed
serious
he
said
bally
dashed
serious
agreed
squiffy
i
going
to
cut
it
out
great
scheme
you
do
think
asked
squiffy
with
a
touch
of
hopefulness
that
it
could
have
been
a
real
snake
never
heard
of
the
management
supplying
i
thought
it
went
under
the
well
take
a
squiffy
shuddered
not
me
i
say
old
top
you
know
i
simply
ca
sleep
in
this
room
now
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
a
doss
somewhere
in
rather
i
in
just
above
trot
along
up
here
the
key
i
tidy
up
a
bit
here
and
join
you
in
a
squiffy
put
on
a
and
disappeared
archie
looked
under
the
bed
from
the
trousers
the
head
of
peter
popped
up
with
its
usual
expression
of
amiable
enquiry
archie
nodded
pleasantly
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
the
problem
of
his
little
friend
immediate
future
wanted
thinking
over
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
remained
for
a
while
in
thought
then
he
rose
an
admirable
solution
had
presented
itself
he
picked
peter
up
and
placed
him
in
the
pocket
of
his
then
leaving
the
room
he
mounted
the
stairs
till
he
reached
the
seventh
floor
outside
a
room
down
the
corridor
he
paused
from
within
through
the
open
transom
came
the
rhythmical
snoring
of
a
good
man
taking
his
rest
after
the
labours
of
the
day
brewster
was
always
a
heavy
sleeper
there
always
a
way
thought
archie
philosophically
if
a
chappie
only
thinks
of
his
snoring
took
on
a
deeper
note
archie
extracted
peter
from
his
pocket
and
dropped
him
gently
through
the
transom
chapter
ix
a
letter
from
parker
as
the
days
went
by
and
he
settled
down
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
archie
looking
about
him
and
revising
earlier
judgments
was
inclined
to
think
that
of
all
his
immediate
circle
he
most
admired
parker
the
lean
grave
valet
of
daniel
brewster
here
was
a
man
who
living
in
the
closest
contact
with
one
of
the
most
difficult
persons
in
new
york
contrived
all
the
while
to
maintain
an
unbowed
head
and
as
far
as
one
could
gather
from
appearances
a
tolerably
cheerful
disposition
a
great
man
judge
him
by
what
standard
you
pleased
anxious
as
he
was
to
earn
an
honest
living
archie
would
not
have
changed
places
with
parker
for
the
salary
of
a
it
was
parker
who
first
directed
archie
attention
to
the
hidden
merits
of
pongo
archie
had
drifted
into
his
suite
one
morning
as
he
sometimes
did
in
the
effort
to
establish
more
amicable
relations
and
had
found
it
occupied
only
by
the
valet
who
was
dusting
the
furniture
and
with
a
feather
broom
rather
in
the
style
of
a
at
the
rise
of
the
curtain
of
an
farce
after
a
courteous
exchange
of
greetings
archie
sat
down
and
lit
a
cigarette
parker
went
on
dusting
the
said
parker
breaking
the
silence
has
some
nice
little
objay
dar
little
what
objay
dar
light
dawned
upon
archie
of
course
yes
french
for
junk
i
see
what
you
mean
now
dare
say
you
right
old
friend
do
know
much
about
these
things
parker
gave
an
appreciative
flick
at
a
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
very
valuable
some
of
the
he
had
picked
up
the
small
china
figure
of
the
warrior
with
the
spear
and
was
grooming
it
with
the
ostentatious
care
of
one
brushing
flies
off
a
sleeping
venus
he
regarded
this
figure
with
a
look
of
affectionate
esteem
which
seemed
to
archie
absolutely
archie
taste
in
art
was
not
precious
to
his
untutored
eye
the
thing
was
only
one
degree
less
foul
than
his
japanese
prints
which
he
had
always
observed
with
silent
loathing
this
one
now
continued
parker
worth
a
lot
of
money
oh
a
lot
of
what
pongo
said
archie
incredulously
sir
i
always
call
that
pongo
do
know
what
else
you
could
call
him
what
the
valet
seemed
to
disapprove
of
this
levity
he
shook
his
head
and
replaced
the
figure
on
the
mantelpiece
worth
a
lot
of
money
he
repeated
not
by
itself
oh
not
by
itself
no
sir
things
like
this
come
in
pairs
somewhere
or
other
there
the
to
this
here
and
if
the
could
get
hold
of
it
he
have
something
worth
having
something
that
connoozers
would
give
a
lot
of
money
for
but
one
no
good
without
the
other
you
have
to
have
both
if
you
understand
my
meaning
i
see
like
filling
a
straight
flush
what
precisely
archie
gazed
at
pongo
again
with
the
dim
hope
of
discovering
virtues
not
immediately
apparent
to
the
casual
observer
but
without
success
pongo
left
him
cold
even
chilly
he
would
not
have
taken
pongo
as
a
gift
to
oblige
a
dying
friend
how
much
would
the
pair
be
worth
he
asked
ten
dollars
parker
smiled
a
gravely
superior
smile
a
leetle
more
than
that
sir
several
thousand
dollars
more
like
do
you
mean
to
say
said
archie
with
honest
amazement
that
there
are
chumps
going
about
loose
absolutely
loose
who
would
pay
that
for
a
weird
little
object
like
pongo
undoubtedly
sir
these
antique
china
figures
are
in
great
demand
among
archie
looked
at
pongo
once
more
and
shook
his
head
well
well
well
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
what
what
might
be
called
the
revival
of
pongo
the
restoration
of
pongo
to
the
ranks
of
the
things
that
matter
took
place
several
weeks
later
when
archie
was
making
holiday
at
the
house
which
his
had
taken
for
the
summer
at
brookport
the
curtain
of
the
second
act
may
be
said
to
rise
on
archie
strolling
back
from
the
in
the
cool
of
an
august
evening
from
time
to
time
he
sang
slightly
and
wondered
idly
if
lucille
would
put
the
finishing
touch
upon
the
of
everything
by
coming
to
meet
him
and
sharing
his
homeward
walk
she
came
in
view
at
this
moment
a
trim
little
figure
in
a
white
skirt
and
a
pale
blue
sweater
she
waved
to
archie
and
archie
as
always
at
the
sight
of
her
was
conscious
of
that
jumpy
fluttering
sensation
about
the
heart
which
translated
into
words
would
have
formed
the
question
what
on
earth
could
have
made
a
girl
like
that
fall
in
love
with
a
chump
like
me
it
was
a
question
which
he
was
continually
asking
himself
and
one
which
was
perpetually
in
the
mind
also
of
brewster
his
the
matter
of
archie
unworthiness
to
be
the
husband
of
lucille
was
practically
the
only
one
on
which
the
two
men
saw
eye
to
eye
hallo
allo
allo
said
archie
here
we
are
what
i
was
just
hoping
you
would
drift
over
the
lucille
kissed
him
you
a
darling
she
said
and
you
look
like
a
greek
god
in
that
glad
you
like
archie
squinted
with
some
complacency
down
his
chest
i
always
say
it
does
matter
what
you
pay
for
a
suit
so
long
as
it
right
i
hope
your
jolly
old
father
will
feel
that
way
when
he
settles
up
for
where
is
father
why
did
he
come
back
with
you
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
seem
any
too
keen
on
my
company
i
left
him
in
the
chewing
a
cigar
gave
me
the
impression
of
having
something
on
his
oh
archie
you
did
beat
him
again
archie
looked
uncomfortable
he
gazed
out
to
sea
with
something
of
embarrassment
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
thing
to
be
absolutely
frank
i
as
it
were
did
not
badly
well
yes
i
rather
fancy
i
put
it
across
him
with
some
vim
and
not
a
little
emphasis
to
be
perfectly
accurate
i
licked
him
by
ten
and
but
you
promised
me
you
would
let
him
beat
you
you
know
how
pleased
it
would
have
made
i
know
but
light
of
my
soul
have
you
any
idea
how
dashed
difficult
it
is
to
get
beaten
by
your
festive
parent
at
golf
oh
well
lucille
sighed
it
ca
be
helped
i
she
felt
in
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
oh
there
a
letter
for
you
i
just
been
to
fetch
the
mail
i
do
know
who
it
can
be
from
the
handwriting
looks
like
a
vampire
kind
of
archie
inspected
the
envelope
it
provided
no
solution
that
rummy
who
could
be
writing
to
me
open
it
and
dashed
bright
scheme
i
will
herbert
parker
who
the
deuce
is
herbert
parker
parker
father
valet
name
was
parker
the
one
he
dismissed
when
he
found
he
was
wearing
his
do
you
mean
to
say
any
reasonable
chappie
would
willingly
wear
the
sort
of
shirts
your
father
i
mean
to
say
there
must
have
been
some
do
read
the
letter
i
expect
he
wants
to
use
your
influence
with
father
to
have
him
taken
my
influence
with
your
father
well
i
dashed
sanguine
sort
of
johnny
if
he
does
well
here
what
he
says
of
course
i
remember
jolly
old
parker
now
great
pal
of
dear
sir
it
is
some
time
since
the
undersigned
had
the
honour
of
conversing
with
you
but
i
am
respectfully
trusting
that
you
may
recall
me
to
mind
when
i
mention
that
until
recently
i
served
brewster
your
in
the
capacity
of
valet
owing
to
an
unfortunate
misunderstanding
i
was
dismissed
from
that
position
and
am
now
temporarily
out
of
a
job
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
isaiah
xiv
you
know
said
archie
admiringly
this
bird
is
hot
stuff
i
mean
to
say
he
writes
dashed
it
is
not
however
with
my
own
affairs
that
i
desire
to
trouble
you
dear
sir
i
have
little
doubt
that
all
will
be
well
with
me
and
that
i
shall
not
fall
like
a
sparrow
to
the
ground
i
have
been
young
and
now
am
old
yet
have
i
not
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
bread
psalms
xxxvii
my
object
in
writing
to
you
is
as
follows
you
may
recall
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
one
morning
in
brewster
suite
when
we
had
an
interesting
talk
on
the
subject
of
mr
b
objets
you
may
recall
being
particularly
interested
in
a
small
china
figure
to
assist
your
memory
the
figure
to
which
i
allude
is
the
one
which
you
whimsically
referred
to
as
pongo
i
informed
you
if
you
remember
that
could
the
accompanying
figure
be
secured
the
pair
would
be
extremely
valuable
i
am
glad
to
say
dear
sir
that
this
has
now
transpired
and
is
on
view
at
beale
art
galleries
on
west
street
where
it
will
be
sold
at
auction
the
sale
commencing
at
sharp
if
brewster
cares
to
attend
he
will
i
fancy
have
little
trouble
in
securing
it
at
a
reasonable
price
i
confess
that
i
had
thought
of
refraining
from
apprising
my
late
employer
of
this
matter
but
more
christian
feelings
have
prevailed
if
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
if
he
thirst
give
him
drink
for
in
so
doing
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
romans
xii
nor
i
must
confess
am
i
altogether
uninfluenced
by
the
thought
that
my
action
in
this
matter
may
conceivably
lead
to
consenting
to
forget
the
past
and
to
reinstate
me
in
my
former
position
however
i
am
confident
that
i
can
leave
this
to
his
good
feeling
i
remain
respectfully
yours
herbert
parker
lucille
clapped
her
hands
how
splendid
father
will
be
pleased
yes
friend
parker
has
certainly
found
a
way
to
make
the
old
dad
fond
of
him
wish
i
could
but
you
can
silly
he
be
delighted
when
you
show
him
that
yes
with
parker
old
herb
parker
is
the
neck
he
fall
on
not
lucille
reflected
i
wish
she
began
she
stopped
her
eyes
lit
up
oh
archie
darling
i
got
an
idea
decant
why
do
you
slip
up
to
new
york
and
buy
the
thing
and
give
it
to
father
as
a
surprise
archie
patted
her
hand
kindly
he
hated
to
spoil
her
girlish
yes
he
said
but
reflect
queen
of
my
heart
i
have
at
the
moment
of
going
to
press
just
two
dollars
fifty
in
specie
which
i
took
off
your
father
this
we
were
playing
cents
a
hole
he
coughed
it
up
without
enthusiasm
in
fact
with
a
nasty
hacking
sound
but
i
got
it
but
that
all
i
have
that
all
right
you
can
pawn
that
ring
and
that
bracelet
of
oh
i
say
what
pop
the
family
jewels
only
for
a
day
or
two
of
course
once
you
got
the
thing
father
will
pay
us
back
he
would
give
you
all
the
money
we
asked
him
for
if
he
knew
what
it
was
for
but
i
want
to
surprise
him
and
if
you
were
to
go
to
him
and
ask
him
for
a
thousand
dollars
without
telling
him
what
it
was
for
he
might
he
might
said
archie
he
might
it
all
works
out
splendidly
the
invitation
handicap
and
father
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
weeks
he
hate
to
have
to
go
up
to
town
himself
and
not
play
in
it
but
you
can
slip
up
and
slip
back
without
his
knowing
anything
about
archie
pondered
it
sounds
a
ripe
scheme
yes
it
has
all
the
of
a
somewhat
fruity

suddenly
when
we

in

what
for

silly
yale
the
oh

then
he
went
over
to
europe
for
a
trip
to
broaden
his
mind
you
must
look
him
up
when
you
get
back
to
new

he
sure
to
be
at
his
i
make
a
point
of
it
well
vote
of
thanks
to
good
old
parker
this
really
does
begin
to
look
like
the
point
in
my
career
where
i
start
to
have
your
forbidding
old
parent
eating
out
of
my
yes
it
an
egg
is
it
queen
of
my
soul
said
archie
enthusiastically
it
an
omelette
the
business
negotiations
in
connection
with
the
bracelet
and
the
ring
occupied
archie
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
to
an
extent
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
call
on
brother
bill
before
lunch
he
decided
to
postpone
the
affecting
meeting
of
to
a
more
convenient
season
and
made
his
way
to
his
favourite
table
at
the
cosmopolis
for
a
bite
of
lunch
preliminary
to
the
fatigues
of
the
sale
he
found
salvatore
hovering
about
as
usual
and
instructed
him
to
come
to
the
rescue
with
a
minute
steak
salvatore
was
the
dark
waiter
who
attended
among
other
tables
to
the
one
at
the
far
end
of
the
at
which
archie
usually
sat
for
several
weeks
archie
conversations
with
the
other
had
dealt
exclusively
with
the
bill
of
fare
and
its
contents
but
gradually
he
had
found
himself
becoming
more
personal
even
before
the
war
and
its
democratising
influences
archie
had
always
lacked
that
reserve
which
characterises
many
britons
and
since
the
war
he
had
looked
on
nearly
everyone
he
met
as
a
brother
long
since
through
the
medium
of
a
series
of
friendly
chats
he
had
heard
all
about
home
in
italy
the
little
newspaper
and
tobacco
shop
which
his
mother
owned
down
on
seventh
avenue
and
a
hundred
other
personal
details
archie
had
an
insatiable
curiosity
about
his
well
done
said
archie
sare
the
steak
not
too
rare
you
very
good
archie
looked
at
the
waiter
closely
his
tone
had
been
subdued
and
sad
of
course
you
do
expect
a
waiter
to
beam
all
over
his
face
and
give
three
rousing
cheers
simply
because
you
have
asked
him
to
bring
you
a
minute
steak
but
still
there
was
something
about
salvatore
manner
that
disturbed
archie
the
man
appeared
to
have
the
pip
whether
he
was
merely
homesick
and
brooding
on
the
lost
delights
of
his
sunny
native
land
or
whether
his
trouble
was
more
definite
could
only
be
ascertained
by
enquiry
so
archie
enquired
what
the
matter
laddie
he
said
sympathetically
something
on
your
mind
sare
i
say
there
seems
to
be
something
on
your
mind
what
the
trouble
the
waiter
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
indicating
an
unwillingness
to
inflict
his
grievances
on
one
of
the
tipping
classes
come
on
persisted
archie
encouragingly
all
pals
here
barge
along
old
thing
and
let
have
salvatore
thus
admonished
proceeded
in
a
hurried
undertone
with
one
eye
on
the
headwaiter
to
lay
bare
his
soul
what
he
said
was
not
very
coherent
but
archie
could
make
out
enough
of
it
to
gather
that
it
was
a
sad
story
of
excessive
hours
and
insufficient
pay
he
mused
awhile
the
waiter
hard
case
touched
him
i
tell
you
what
he
said
at
last
when
jolly
old
brewster
conies
back
to
town
he
away
just
now
i
take
you
along
to
him
and
beard
the
old
boy
in
his
den
i
introduce
you
and
you
get
that
extract
from
italian
your
chest
which
you
just
been
singing
to
me
and
you
find
it
be
all
right
he
is
what
you
might
call
one
of
my
greatest
admirers
but
everybody
says
he
a
square
sort
of
cove
and
he
see
you
are
snootered
and
now
laddie
touching
the
matter
of
that
the
waiter
disappeared
greatly
cheered
and
archie
turning
perceived
that
his
friend
reggie
van
tuyl
was
entering
the
room
he
waved
to
him
to
join
his
table
he
liked
reggie
and
it
also
occurred
to
him
that
a
man
of
the
world
like
the
heir
of
the
van
tuyls
who
had
been
popping
about
new
york
for
years
might
be
able
to
give
him
some
information
on
the
procedure
at
an
auction
sale
a
matter
on
which
he
himself
was
profoundly
ignorant
chapter
x
doing
father
a
bit
of
good
reggie
van
tuyl
approached
the
table
languidly
and
sank
down
into
a
chair
he
was
a
long
youth
with
a
rather
subdued
and
deflated
look
as
though
the
burden
of
the
van
tuyl
millions
was
more
than
his
frail
strength
could
support
most
things
tired
him
i
say
reggie
old
top
said
archie
you
just
the
lad
i
wanted
to
see
i
require
the
assistance
of
a
blighter
of
ripe
intellect
tell
me
laddie
do
you
know
anything
about
sales
reggie
eyed
him
sleepily
sales

reggie
considered
well
they
sales
you
he
checked
a
yawn
auction
sales
you
yes
said
archie
encouragingly
something
the
name
or
something
seemed
to
tell
me
fellows
put
things
up
for
sale
you
know
and
other
fellows
other
fellows
go
in
and
and
buy
if
you
follow

but
what
the
procedure
i
mean
what
do
i
do
that
what
after
i
got
to
buy
something
at
beale
this
afternoon
how
do
i
set
about
it
well
said
reggie
drowsily
there
are
several
ways
of
bidding
you
know
you
can
shout
or
you
can
nod
or
you
can
twiddle
your
fingers
the
effort
of
concentration
was
too
much
for
him
he
leaned
back
limply
in
his
chair
i
tell
you
what
i
nothing
to
do
this
afternoon
i
come
with
you
and
show
when
he
entered
the
art
galleries
a
few
minutes
later
archie
was
glad
of
the
moral
support
of
even
such
a
wobbly
reed
as
reggie
van
tuyl
there
is
something
about
an
auction
room
which
weighs
heavily
upon
the
novice
the
hushed
interior
was
bathed
in
a
dim
religious
light
and
the
congregation
seated
on
small
wooden
chairs
gazed
in
reverent
silence
at
the
pulpit
where
a
gentleman
of
commanding
presence
and
sparkling
was
delivering
a
species
of
chant
behind
a
gold
curtain
at
the
end
of
the
room
mysterious
forms
flitted
to
and
fro
archie
who
had
been
expecting
something
on
the
lines
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
he
had
once
been
privileged
to
visit
when
it
was
in
a
more
than
usually
feverish
mood
found
the
atmosphere
oppressively
ecclesiastical
he
sat
down
and
looked
about
him
the
presiding
priest
went
on
with
his
chant
worth
three
hundred
ought
to
bring
five
hundred
he
stopped
and
eyed
the
worshippers
with
a
glittering
and
reproachful
eye
they
had
it
seemed
disappointed
him
his
lips
curled
and
he
waved
a
hand
towards
a
grimly
chair
with
insecure
legs
and
a
good
deal
of
gold
paint
about
it
gentlemen
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
are
not
here
to
waste
my
time
i
am
not
here
to
waste
yours
am
i
seriously
offered
nineteen
dollars
for
this
chair
acknowledged
to
be
the
finest
piece
sold
in
new
york
for
months
and
months
am
i
twenty
i
thank
you
your
opportunity
priceless
very
few
extant
just
what
you
are
looking
for
the
only
one
in
the
city
of
new
york
look
at
those
legs
back
it
into
the
light
willie
let
the
light
fall
on
those
legs
willie
a
sort
of
acolyte
manoeuvred
the
chair
as
directed
reggie
van
tuyl
who
had
been
yawning
in
a
hopeless
sort
of
way
showed
his
first
flicker
of
interest
willie
he
observed
eyeing
that
youth
more
with
pity
than
reproach
has
a
face
like
the
boy
do
you
think
so
archie
nodded
briefly
precisely
the
same
criticism
had
occurred
to
him
chanted
the
once
twice
third
and
last
call
sold
at
gentleman
in
the
fifth
archie
looked
up
and
down
the
row
with
a
keen
eye
he
was
anxious
to
see
who
had
been
chump
enough
to
give
dollars
for
such
a
frightful
object
he
became
aware
of
the
willie
leaning
towards
him
name
please
said
the
canine
one
eh
what
said
archie
oh
my
name
moffam
do
you
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
made
him
feel
a
little
nervous
er
glad
to
meet
you
and
all
that
sort
of
ten
dollars
deposit
please
said
willie
i
do
absolutely
follow
you
old
bean
what
is
the
big
thought
at
the
back
of
all
this
ten
dollars
deposit
on
the
what
chair
you
bid
dollars
for
the
me
you
nodded
said
willie
accusingly
if
he
went
on
reasoning
closely
you
did
want
to
bid
why
did
you
nod
archie
was
embarrassed
he
could
of
course
have
pointed
out
that
he
had
merely
nodded
in
adhesion
to
the
statement
that
the
other
had
a
face
like
the
boy
but
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
a
purist
might
consider
the
excuse
deficient
in
tact
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
handed
over
a
bill
the
price
of
feelings
willie
withdrew
like
a
tiger
slinking
from
the
body
of
its
victim
i
say
old
thing
said
archie
to
reggie
this
is
a
bit
thick
you
know
no
purse
will
stand
this
reggie
considered
the
matter
his
face
seemed
drawn
under
the
mental
strain
do
nod
again
he
advised
if
you
are
careful
you
get
into
the
habit
of
it
when
you
want
to
bid
just
twiddle
your
fingers
yes
that
the
thing
twiddle
he
sighed
drowsily
the
atmosphere
of
the
auction
room
was
close
you
were
allowed
to
smoke
and
altogether
he
was
beginning
to
regret
that
he
had
come
the
service
continued
objects
of
varying
unattractiveness
came
and
went
eulogised
by
the
officiating
priest
but
coldly
received
by
the
congregation
relations
between
the
former
and
the
latter
were
growing
more
and
more
distant
the
congregation
seemed
to
suspect
the
priest
of
having
an
ulterior
motive
in
his
eulogies
and
the
priest
seemed
to
suspect
the
congregation
of
a
frivolous
desire
to
waste
his
time
he
had
begun
to
speculate
openly
as
to
why
they
were
there
at
all
once
when
a
particularly
repellent
statuette
of
a
nude
female
with
an
unwholesome
green
skin
had
been
offered
at
two
dollars
and
had
found
no
bidders
the
congregation
appearing
silently
grateful
for
his
statement
that
it
was
the
only
specimen
of
its
kind
on
the
continent
he
had
specifically
accused
them
of
having
come
into
the
auction
room
merely
with
the
purpose
of
sitting
down
and
taking
the
weight
off
their
feet
if
your
thing
your
does
come
up
soon
archie
said
reggie
fighting
off
with
an
effort
the
mists
of
sleep
i
rather
think
i
shall
be
toddling
along
what
was
it
you
came
to
get
it
rather
difficult
to
describe
it
a
sort
of
made
of
china
or
something
i
call
it
pongo
at
least
this
one
is
pongo
do
you
know
it
his
little
brother
but
presumably
equally
foul
in
every
respect
it
all
rather
complicated
i
know
but
hallo
he
pointed
excitedly
by
jove
we
off
there
it
is
look
willie
unleashing
it
now
willie
who
had
disappeared
through
the
gold
curtain
had
now
returned
and
was
placing
on
a
pedestal
a
small
china
figure
of
delicate
workmanship
it
was
the
figure
of
a
warrior
in
a
suit
of
armour
advancing
with
raised
spear
upon
an
adversary
a
thrill
permeated
archie
frame
parker
had
not
been
mistaken
this
was
undoubtedly
the
to
the
redoubtable
pongo
the
two
were
identical
even
from
where
he
sat
archie
could
detect
on
the
features
of
the
figure
on
the
pedestal
the
same
expression
of
insufferable
complacency
which
had
alienated
his
sympathies
from
the
original
pongo
the
undaunted
by
previous
rebuffs
regarded
the
figure
with
a
gloating
enthusiasm
wholly
unshared
by
the
congregation
who
were
plainly
looking
upon
pongo
little
brother
as
just
another
of
those
things
this
he
said
with
a
shake
in
his
voice
is
something
very
special
china
figure
said
to
date
back
to
the
ming
dynasty
unique
nothing
like
it
on
either
side
of
the
atlantic
if
i
were
selling
this
at
christie
in
london
where
people
he
said
nastily
have
an
educated
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
the
rare
and
the
exquisite
i
should
start
the
bidding
at
a
thousand
dollars
this
afternoon
experience
has
taught
me
that
that
might
possibly
be
too
his
sparkled
militantly
as
he
gazed
upon
the
stolid
throng
will
anyone
offer
me
a
dollar
for
this
unique
figure
leap
at
it
old
top
said
reggie
van
tuyl
twiddle
dear
boy
twiddle
a
dollar
archie
twiddled
one
dollar
i
am
offered
said
the
bitterly
one
gentleman
here
is
not
afraid
to
take
a
chance
one
gentleman
here
knows
a
good
thing
when
he
sees
he
abandoned
the
gently
sarcastic
manner
for
one
of
crisp
and
direct
reproach
come
come
gentlemen
we
are
not
here
to
waste
time
will
anyone
offer
me
one
hundred
dollars
for
this
superb
piece
of
he
broke
off
and
seemed
for
a
moment
almost
unnerved
he
stared
at
someone
in
one
of
the
seats
in
front
of
archie
thank
you
he
said
with
a
sort
of
gulp
one
hundred
dollars
i
am
offered
one
hundred
one
hundred
one
hundred
archie
was
startled
this
sudden
tremendous
jump
this
wholly
unforeseen
boom
in
pongos
if
one
might
so
describe
it
was
more
than
a
little
disturbing
he
could
not
see
who
his
rival
was
but
it
was
evident
that
at
least
one
among
those
present
did
not
intend
to
allow
pongo
brother
to
slip
by
without
a
fight
he
looked
helplessly
at
reggie
for
counsel
but
reggie
had
now
definitely
given
up
the
struggle
exhausted
nature
had
done
its
utmost
and
now
he
was
leaning
back
with
closed
eyes
breathing
softly
through
his
nose
thrown
on
his
own
resources
archie
could
think
of
no
better
course
than
to
twiddle
his
fingers
again
he
did
so
and
the
chant
took
on
a
note
of
positive
exuberance
two
hundred
i
am
offered
much
better
turn
the
pedestal
round
willie
and
let
them
look
at
it
slowly
slowly
you
are
spinning
a
two
hundred
he
became
suddenly
lyrical
there
was
a
young
lady
named
lou
who
was
catching
a
train
at
said
the
porter
worry
or
hurry
or
scurry
it
a
minute
or
two
to
archie
concern
increased
he
seemed
to
be
twiddling
at
this
voluble
man
across
seas
of
misunderstanding
nothing
is
harder
to
interpret
to
a
nicety
than
a
twiddle
and
archie
idea
of
the
language
of
twiddles
and
the
idea
did
not
coincide
by
a
mile
the
appeared
to
consider
that
when
archie
twiddled
it
was
his
intention
to
bid
in
hundreds
whereas
in
fact
archie
had
meant
to
signify
that
he
raised
the
previous
bid
by
just
one
dollar
archie
felt
that
if
given
time
he
could
make
this
clear
to
the
but
the
latter
gave
him
no
time
he
had
got
his
audience
so
to
speak
on
the
run
and
he
proposed
to
hustle
them
before
they
could
rally
two
hundred
two
hundred
two
three
thank
you
sir
archie
sat
limply
in
his
wooden
chair
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
which
he
had
only
experienced
twice
in
his
life
once
when
he
had
taken
his
first
lesson
in
driving
a
motor
and
had
trodden
on
the
accelerator
instead
of
the
brake
the
second
time
more
recently
when
he
had
made
his
first
on
an
express
lift
he
had
now
precisely
the
same
sensation
of
being
run
away
with
by
an
uncontrollable
machine
and
of
having
left
most
of
his
internal
organs
at
some
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
his
body
emerging
from
this
welter
of
emotion
stood
out
the
one
clear
fact
that
be
the
opposition
bidding
what
it
might
he
must
nevertheless
secure
the
prize
lucille
had
sent
him
to
new
york
expressly
to
do
so
she
had
sacrificed
her
jewellery
for
the
cause
she
relied
on
him
the
enterprise
had
become
for
archie
something
almost
sacred
he
felt
dimly
like
a
knight
of
old
hot
on
the
track
of
the
holy
grail
he
twiddled
again
the
ring
and
the
bracelet
had
fetched
nearly
twelve
hundred
dollars
up
to
that
figure
his
hat
was
in
the
ring
eight
hundred
i
am
offered
eight
hundred
a
voice
spoke
from
somewhere
at
the
back
of
the
room
a
quiet
cold
nasty
determined
voice
nine
archie
rose
from
his
seat
and
spun
round
this
mean
attack
from
the
rear
stung
his
fighting
spirit
as
he
rose
a
young
man
sitting
immediately
in
front
of
him
rose
too
and
stared
likewise
he
was
a
young
man
who
reminded
archie
vaguely
of
somebody
he
had
seen
before
but
archie
was
too
busy
trying
to
locate
the
man
at
the
back
to
pay
much
attention
to
him
he
detected
him
at
last
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
eyes
of
everybody
in
that
part
of
the
room
were
fixed
upon
him
he
was
a
small
man
of
middle
age
with
spectacles
he
might
have
been
a
professor
or
something
of
the
kind
whatever
he
was
he
was
obviously
a
man
to
be
reckoned
with
he
had
a
rich
sort
of
look
and
his
demeanour
was
the
demeanour
of
a
man
who
is
prepared
to
fight
it
out
on
these
lines
if
it
takes
all
the
summer
nine
hundred
i
am
offered
archie
glared
defiantly
at
the
spectacled
man
a
thousand
he
cried
the
irruption
of
high
finance
into
the
placid
course
of
the
proceedings
had
stirred
the
congregation
out
of
its
lethargy
there
were
excited
murmurs
necks
were
craned
feet
shuffled
as
for
the
his
cheerfulness
was
now
more
than
restored
and
his
faith
in
his
had
soared
from
the
depths
to
a
very
lofty
altitude
he
beamed
with
approval
despite
the
warmth
of
his
praise
he
would
have
been
quite
satisfied
to
see
pongo
little
brother
go
at
twenty
dollars
and
the
reflection
that
the
bidding
had
already
reached
one
thousand
and
that
his
commission
was
twenty
per
cent
had
engendered
a
mood
of
sunny
happiness
one
thousand
is
bid
he
carolled
now

archie
sitting
dazedly
was
aware
that
reggie
van
tuyl
had
finished
his
beauty
sleep
and
was
addressing
the
young
man
in
the
seat
in
front
why

chuckled
sleepily
i
was
forgetting
of

your

the
young
man
talking
of
my
sister
he
said
to
reggie

any
chance

she
married
some
awful
chump
me
said
archie
how
that
i
married
your
sister
my

the
young
man
seemed
a
trifle
taken
aback
sorry
he
said
not
at
all
said
archie
i
was
only
going
by
what
my
father
said
in
his
letters
he
explained
in
extenuation
archie
nodded
i
afraid
your
jolly
old
father
does
appreciate
me
but
i
hoping
for
the
best
if
i
can
rope
in
that
little
china
thing
that
the
boy
is
showing
the
customers
he
will
be
all
over

to
say
you

another
like

if
he
can
get
a
full
house
as
it
were
i
given
to

the
young

you
bidding
against
me
i
wanted
to
buy
the

as

surprise

that
the
thing
was
to

parker
great
scot
it

parker
who
tipped
me
off
i
met
him
on
broadway
and
he
told

never
mentioned
it
in
his
letter
to
me
why
dash
it
we
could
have
got
the
thing
for
about
two
dollars
if
we
had
pooled

said
archie
magnanimously
it
all
the

to
me
i
only
wanted

from

rambles
among

back
on
his

his
discourse

gentlemen
i
do
want
to
give
this
superb

hundred
this
is
more
the
sort
of
thing
i
have
been
accustomed
to
when
i
was
at
sotheby
rooms
in
london
this
kind
of
bidding
was
a
one
hardly
noticed
it
hundred
dollars
i
am
he
gazed
expectantly
at
archie
as
a
man
gazes
at
some
favourite
dog
whom
he
calls
upon
to
perform
a
trick
but
archie
had
reached
the
end
of
his
tether
the
hand
that
had
twiddled
so
often
and
so
bravely
lay
inert
beside
his
twitching
feebly
archie
was
through
hundred
said
the
ingratiatingly
archie
made
no
movement
there
was
a
tense
pause
the
gave
a
little
sigh
like
one
waking
from
a
beautiful
dream
hundred
he
said
once
twice
third
last
and
final
call
sold
at
hundred
i
congratulate
you
sir
on
a
genuine
bargain
reggie
van
tuyl
had
dozed
off
again
archie
tapped
his
on
the
shoulder
may
as
well
be
popping
what
they
threaded
their
way
sadly
together
through
the
crowd
and
made
for
the
street
they
passed
into
fifth
avenue
without
breaking
the
silence
bally
nuisance
said
archie
at
last
rotten
wonder
who
that
chappie
was
some
collector
well
it
ca
be
helped
said
archie
brother
bill
attached
himself
to
archie
arm
and
became
communicative
i
did
want
to
mention
it
in
front
of
van
tuyl
he
said
because
he
such
a
and
it
would
have
been
all
over
new
york
before
but
you
one
of
the
family
and
you
can
keep
a
absolutely
silent
tomb
and
what
the
reason
i
wanted
that
darned
thing
was
because
i
just
got
engaged
to
a
girl
over
in
england
and
i
thought
that
if
i
could
hand
my
father
that
china
with
one
hand
and
break
the
news
with
the
other
it
might
help
a
bit
she
the
most
wonderful
girl
i
bet
she
is
said
archie
cordially
the
trouble
is
she
in
the
chorus
of
one
of
the
revues
over
there
and
father
is
apt
to
kick
so
i
thought
oh
well
it
no
good
worrying
now
come
along
where
it
quiet
and
i
tell
you
all
about
that
be
jolly
said

chapter
xi
salvatore
chooses
the
wrong
moment
archie
reclaimed
the
family
jewellery
from
its
temporary
home
next
morning
and
having
done
so
sauntered
back
to
the
cosmopolis
he
was
surprised
on
entering
the
lobby
to
meet
his
more
surprising
still
brewster
was
manifestly
in
a
mood
of
extraordinary
geniality
archie
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
when
the
other
waved
cheerily
to
him
nor
his
ears
a
moment
later
when
brewster
addressing
him
as
my
boy
asked
him
how
he
was
and
mentioned
that
the
day
was
a
warm
one
obviously
this
jovial
frame
of
mind
must
be
taken
advantage
of
and
archie
first
thought
was
of
the
downtrodden
salvatore
to
the
tale
of
whose
wrongs
he
had
listened
so
sympathetically
on
the
previous
day
now
was
plainly
the
moment
for
the
waiter
to
submit
his
grievance
before
some
caused
the
milk
of
human
kindness
to
flow
out
of
daniel
brewster
with
a
swift
cheerio
in
his
direction
archie
bounded
into
the
salvatore
the
hour
for
luncheon
being
imminent
but
not
yet
having
arrived
was
standing
against
the
far
wall
in
an
attitude
of
thought
laddie
cried
archie
sare
a
most
extraordinary
thing
has
happened
good
old
brewster
has
suddenly
popped
up
through
a
trap
and
is
out
in
the
lobby
now
and
what
still
more
weird
he
apparently
sare
braced
you
know
in
the
pink
pleased
about
something
if
you
go
to
him
now
with
that
yarn
of
yours
you
ca
fail
he
kiss
you
on
both
cheeks
and
give
you
his
and
charge
along
and
ask
the
if
you
can
have
ten
minutes
salvatore
vanished
in
search
of
the
potentate
named
and
archie
returned
to
the
lobby
to
bask
in
the
unwonted
sunshine
well
well
well
what
he
said
i
thought
you
were
at
i
came
up
this
morning
to
meet
a
friend
of
mine
replied
brewster
genially
professor
do
think
i
know
very
interesting
man
said
brewster
still
with
the
same
uncanny
amiability
he
a
dabbler
in
a
good
many
things
science
phrenology
antiques
i
asked
him
to
bid
for
me
at
a
sale
yesterday
there
was
a
little
china
figure
archie
jaw
fell
china
figure
he
stammered
feebly
yes
the
companion
to
one
you
may
have
noticed
on
my
mantelpiece
upstairs
i
have
been
trying
to
get
the
pair
of
them
for
years
i
should
never
have
heard
of
this
one
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
valet
of
mine
parker
very
good
of
him
to
let
me
know
of
it
considering
i
had
fired
him
ah
here
is
he
moved
to
greet
the
small
man
with
the
spectacles
who
was
bustling
across
the
lobby
well
binstead
so
you
got
it
i
suppose
the
price
was
particularly
stiff
hundred
brewster
seemed
to
reel
in
his
tracks
hundred
you
gave
me
carte
yes
but
hundred
i
could
have
got
it
for
a
few
dollars
but
unfortunately
i
was
a
little
late
and
when
i
arrived
some
young
fool
had
bid
it
up
to
a
thousand
and
he
stuck
to
me
till
i
finally
shook
him
off
at
hundred
why
this
is
the
very
man
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
archie
coughed
more
a
relation
than
a
friend
what
do
you
know
brewster
amiability
had
vanished
what
damned
foolery
have
you
been
up
to
now
he
demanded
ca
i
move
a
step
without
stubbing
my
toe
on
you
why
the
devil
did
you
bid
we
thought
it
would
be
rather
a
fruity
scheme
we
talked
it
over
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
an
egg
wanted
to
get
hold
of
the
rummy
little
object
do
you
know
and
surprise
who
we
lucille
and
but
how
did
you
hear
of
it
at
all
parker
the
you
know
wrote
me
a
letter
about
parker
did
he
tell
you
that
he
had
told
me
the
figure
was
to
be
sold
absolutely
not
a
sudden
suspicion
came
to
archie
he
was
normally
a
guileless
young
man
but
even
to
him
the
extreme
fishiness
of
the
part
played
by
herbert
parker
had
become
apparent
i
say
you
know
it
looks
to
me
as
if
friend
parker
had
been
having
us
all
on
a
bit
what
i
mean
to
say
it
was
jolly
old
herb
who
tipped
your
son
off
bill
you
know
to
go
and
bid
for
the
bill
was
bill
there
absolutely
in
person
we
were
bidding
against
each
other
like
the
dickens
till
we
managed
to
get
together
and
get
acquainted
and
then
this
bird
this
gentleman
sailed
in
and
started
to
slip
it
across
professor
binstead
chuckled
the
chuckle
of
a
man
who
sees
all
those
around
him
smitten
in
the
pocket
while
he
himself
remains
untouched
a
very
ingenious
rogue
this
parker
of
yours
brewster
his
method
seems
to
have
been
simple
but
masterly
i
have
no
doubt
that
either
he
or
a
confederate
obtained
the
figure
and
placed
it
with
the
auctioneer
and
then
he
ensured
a
good
price
for
it
by
getting
us
all
to
bid
against
each
other
very
ingenious
brewster
struggled
with
his
feelings
then
he
seemed
to
overcome
them
and
to
force
himself
to
look
on
the
bright
side
well
anyway
he
said
i
got
the
pair
of
figures
and
that
what
i
wanted
is
that
it
in
that
parcel
this
is
it
i
would
trust
an
express
company
to
deliver
it
suppose
we
go
up
to
your
room
and
see
how
the
two
look
side
by
they
crossed
the
lobby
to
the
cloud
was
still
on
brewster
brow
as
they
stepped
out
and
made
their
way
to
his
suite
like
most
men
who
have
risen
from
poverty
to
wealth
by
their
own
exertions
brewster
objected
to
parting
with
his
money
unnecessarily
and
it
was
plain
that
that
hundred
dollars
still
rankled
brewster
unlocked
the
door
and
crossed
the
room
then
suddenly
he
halted
stared
and
stared
again
he
sprang
to
the
bell
and
pressed
it
then
stood
gurgling
wordlessly
anything
wrong
old
bean
queried
archie
solicitously
wrong
wrong
it
gone
gone
the
figure
the
had
manifested
himself
silently
in
answer
to
the
bell
and
was
standing
in
the
doorway
simmons
brewster
turned
to
him
wildly
has
anyone
been
in
this
suite
since
i
went
away
no
nobody
nobody
except
your
valet
sir
parker
he
said
he
had
come
to
fetch
some
things
away
i
supposed
he
had
come
from
you
sir
with
get
out
professor
binstead
had
unwrapped
his
parcel
and
had
placed
the
pongo
on
the
table
there
was
a
weighty
silence
archie
picked
up
the
little
china
figure
and
balanced
it
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
was
a
small
thing
he
reflected
philosophically
but
it
had
made
quite
a
stir
in
the
world
brewster
fermented
for
a
while
without
speaking
so
he
said
at
last
in
a
voice
trembling
with
i
have
been
to
all
this
trouble
and
expense
put
in
professor
binstead
gently
merely
to
buy
back
something
which
had
been
stolen
from
me
and
owing
to
your
damned
officiousness
he
cried
turning
on
archie
i
have
had
to
pay
hundred
dollars
for
it
i
do
know
why
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
job
job
never
had
anything
like
you
around
of
course
argued
archie
he
had
one
or
two
boils
what
are
boils
dashed
sorry
murmured
archie
acted
for
the
best
meant
well
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
professor
binstead
mind
seemed
occupied
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
aspects
of
the
affair
with
the
ingenuity
of
the
absent
parker
a
cunning
scheme
he
said
a
very
cunning
scheme
this
man
parker
must
have
a
brain
of
no
low
order
i
should
like
to
feel
his
bumps
i
should
like
to
give
him
some
said
the
stricken
brewster
he
breathed
a
deep
breath
oh
well
he
said
situated
as
i
am
with
a
crook
valet
and
an
imbecile
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
thankful
that
i
still
got
my
own
property
even
if
i
have
had
to
pay
hundred
dollars
for
the
privilege
of
keeping
he
rounded
on
archie
who
was
in
a
reverie
the
thought
of
the
unfortunate
bill
had
just
crossed
archie
mind
it
would
be
many
moons
many
weary
moons
before
brewster
would
be
in
a
suitable
mood
to
listen
sympathetically
to
the
story
of
love
young
dream
give
me
that
figure
archie
continued
to
toy
absently
with
pongo
he
was
wondering
now
how
best
to
break
this
sad
occurrence
to
lucille
it
would
be
a
disappointment
for
the
poor
girl
give
me
that
figure
archie
started
violently
there
was
an
instant
in
which
pongo
seemed
to
hang
suspended
like
mohammed
coffin
between
heaven
and
earth
then
the
force
of
gravity
asserted
itself
pongo
fell
with
a
sharp
crack
and
disintegrated
and
as
it
did
so
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
in
walked
a
dark
furtive
person
who
to
the
inflamed
vision
of
daniel
brewster
looked
like
something
connected
with
the
executive
staff
of
the
black
hand
with
all
time
at
his
disposal
the
unfortunate
salvatore
had
selected
this
moment
for
stating
his
case
get
out
bellowed
brewster
i
did
ring
for
a
archie
his
mind
reeling
beneath
the
catastrophe
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
do
the
honours
it
was
at
his
instigation
that
salvatore
was
there
and
greatly
as
he
wished
that
he
could
have
seen
fit
to
choose
a
more
auspicious
moment
for
his
business
chat
he
felt
compelled
to
do
his
best
to
see
him
through
oh
i
say
half
a
second
he
said
you
do
quite
understand
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
chappie
is
by
way
of
being
downtrodden
and
oppressed
and
what
not
and
i
suggested
that
he
should
get
hold
of
you
and
speak
a
few
words
of
course
if
you
rather
some
other
time
but
brewster
was
not
permitted
to
postpone
the
interview
before
he
could
get
his
breath
salvatore
had
begun
to
talk
he
was
a
strong
ambidextrous
talker
whom
it
was
hard
to
interrupt
and
it
was
not
for
some
moments
that
brewster
succeeded
in
getting
a
word
in
when
he
did
he
spoke
to
the
point
though
not
a
linguist
he
had
been
able
to
follow
the
discourse
closely
enough
to
realise
that
the
waiter
was
dissatisfied
with
conditions
in
his
hotel
and
brewster
as
has
been
indicated
had
a
short
way
with
people
who
criticised
the
cosmopolis
you
fired
said
brewster
oh
i
say
protested
archie
salvatore
muttered
what
sounded
like
a
passage
from
dante
fired
repeated
brewster
resolutely
and
i
wish
to
heaven
he
added
eyeing
his
malignantly
i
could
fire
you
well
said
professor
binstead
cheerfully
breaking
the
grim
silence
which
followed
this
outburst
if
you
will
give
me
your
cheque
brewster
i
think
i
will
be
going
two
thousand
three
hundred
dollars
make
it
open
if
you
will
and
then
i
can
run
round
the
corner
and
cash
it
before
lunch
that
will
be
capital

bright

the
hermitage
unrivalled
scenery
superb
cuisine
daniel
brewster
proprietor
was
a
picturesque
summer
hotel
in
the
green
heart
of
the
mountains
built
by
archie
shortly
after
he
assumed
control
of
the
cosmopolis
brewster
himself
seldom
went
there
preferring
to
concentrate
his
attention
on
his
new
york
establishment
and
archie
and
lucille
breakfasting
in
the
airy
some
ten
days
after
the
incidents
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
had
consequently
to
be
content
with
two
out
of
the
three
advertised
attractions
of
the
place
through
the
window
at
their
side
quite
a
slab
of
the
unrivalled
scenery
was
visible
some
of
the
superb
cuisine
was
already
on
the
table
and
the
fact
that
the
eye
searched
in
vain
for
daniel
brewster
proprietor
filled
archie
at
any
rate
with
no
sense
of
aching
loss
he
bore
it
with
equanimity
and
even
with
positive
enthusiasm
in
opinion
practically
all
a
place
needed
to
make
it
an
earthly
paradise
was
for
daniel
brewster
to
be
about
miles
away
from
it
it
was
at
lucille
suggestion
that
they
had
come
to
the
hermitage
never
a
human
sunbeam
brewster
had
shown
such
a
bleak
front
to
the
world
and
particularly
to
his
in
the
days
following
the
pongo
incident
that
lucille
had
thought
that
he
and
archie
would
for
a
time
at
least
be
better
apart
a
view
with
which
her
husband
cordially
agreed
he
had
enjoyed
his
stay
at
the
hermitage
and
now
he
regarded
the
eternal
hills
with
the
comfortable
affection
of
a
healthy
man
who
is
breakfasting
well
it
going
to
be
another
perfectly
topping
day
he
observed
eyeing
the
shimmering
landscape
from
which
the
morning
mists
were
swiftly
shredding
away
like
faint
puffs
of
smoke
just
the
day
you
ought
to
have
been
yes
it
too
bad
i
got
to
go
new
york
will
be
like
an
put
it
i
ca
i
afraid
i
a
archie
argued
no
further
he
was
a
married
man
of
old
enough
standing
to
know
the
importance
of
fittings
besides
said
lucille
i
want
to
see
archie
repressed
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
i
be
back
evening
you
will
be
perfectly
queen
of
my
soul
you
know
i
ca
be
happy
with
you
away
you
know
yes
murmured
lucille
appreciatively
she
never
tired
of
hearing
archie
say
this
sort
of
thing
archie
voice
had
trailed
off
he
was
looking
across
the
room
by
jove
he
exclaimed
what
an
awfully
pretty
woman
where
over
there
just
coming
in
i
say
what
wonderful
eyes
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
such
eyes
did
you
notice
her
eyes
sort
of
flashing
awfully
pretty
woman
warm
though
the
morning
was
a
suspicion
of
chill
descended
upon
the
a
certain
coldness
seemed
to
come
into
lucille
face
she
could
not
always
share
archie
fresh
young
enthusiasms
do
you
think
so
wonderful
figure
too
yes
well
what
i
mean
to
say
fair
to
medium
said
archie
recovering
a
certain
amount
of
that
intelligence
which
raises
man
above
the
level
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
not
the
sort
of
type
i
admire
myself
of
you
know
her
do
you
absolutely
not
and
far
from
it
said
archie
hastily
never
met
her
in
my
you
seen
her
on
the
stage
her
name
vera
silverton
we
saw
her
in
of
course
yes
so
we
did
i
say
i
wonder
what
she
doing
here
she
ought
to
be
in
new
york
rehearsing
i
remember
meeting
you
know
chappie
who
writes
plays
and
what
not
george
benham
i
remember
meeting
george
benham
and
he
told
me
she
was
rehearsing
in
a
piece
of
his
called
i
forget
the
name
but
i
know
it
was
called
something
or
other
well
why
is
she
she
probably
lost
her
temper
and
broke
her
contract
and
came
away
she
always
doing
that
sort
of
thing
she
known
for
it
she
must
be
a
horrid
i
do
want
to
talk
about
her
she
used
to
be
married
to
someone
and
she
divorced
him
and
then
she
was
married
to
someone
else
and
he
divorced
her
and
i
certain
her
hair
was
that
colour
two
years
ago
and
i
do
think
a
woman
ought
to
make
up
like
that
and
her
dress
is
all
wrong
for
the
country
and
those
pearls
ca
be
genuine
and
i
hate
the
way
she
rolls
her
eyes
about
and
pink
does
suit
her
a
bit
i
think
she
an
awful
woman
and
i
wish
you
would
keep
on
talking
about
said
archie
dutifully
they
finished
breakfast
and
lucille
went
up
to
pack
her
bag
archie
strolled
out
on
to
the
terrace
outside
the
hotel
where
he
smoked
communed
with
nature
and
thought
of
lucille
he
always
thought
of
lucille
when
he
was
alone
especially
when
he
chanced
to
find
himself
in
poetic
surroundings
like
those
provided
by
the
unrivalled
scenery
encircling
the
hotel
hermitage
the
longer
he
was
married
to
her
the
more
did
the
sacred
institution
seem
to
him
a
good
egg
brewster
might
regard
their
marriage
as
one
of
the
world
most
unfortunate
incidents
but
to
archie
it
was
and
always
had
been
a
bit
of
all
right
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
did
he
marvel
that
a
girl
like
lucille
should
have
been
content
to
link
her
lot
with
that
of
a
class
c
specimen
like
himself
his
meditations
were
in
fact
precisely
what
a
man
meditations
ought
to
be
he
was
roused
from
them
by
a
species
of
exclamation
or
cry
almost
at
his
elbow
and
turned
to
find
that
the
spectacular
miss
silverton
was
standing
beside
him
her
dubious
hair
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
and
one
of
the
criticised
eyes
was
screwed
up
the
other
gazed
at
archie
with
an
expression
of
appeal
there
something
in
my
eye
she
said
no
really
i
wonder
if
you
would
mind
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
archie
would
have
preferred
to
remove
himself
but
no
man
worthy
of
the
name
can
decline
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
womanhood
in
distress
to
twist
the
lady
upper
lid
back
and
peer
into
it
and
jab
at
it
with
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
was
the
only
course
open
to
him
his
conduct
may
be
classed
as
not
merely
blameless
but
definitely
praiseworthy
king
arthur
knights
used
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
all
the
time
and
look
what
people
think
of
them
lucille
therefore
coming
out
of
the
hotel
just
as
the
operation
was
concluded
ought
not
to
have
felt
the
annoyance
she
did
but
of
course
there
is
a
certain
superficial
intimacy
about
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
is
taking
a
fly
out
of
a
woman
eye
which
may
excusably
jar
upon
the
sensibilities
of
his
wife
it
is
an
attitude
which
suggests
a
sort
of
rapprochement
or
camaraderie
or
as
archie
would
have
put
it
what
not
thanks
so
much
said
miss
silverton
oh
no
rather
not
said
archie
such
a
nuisance
getting
things
in
your
absolutely
i
always
doing
it
rotten
luck
but
i
do
often
find
anyone
as
clever
as
you
to
help
lucille
felt
called
upon
to
break
in
on
this
feast
of
reason
and
flow
of
soul
archie
she
said
if
you
go
and
get
your
clubs
now
i
shall
just
have
time
to
walk
round
with
you
before
my
train
oh
ah
said
archie
perceiving
her
for
the
first
time
oh
ah
yes
yes
yes
yes
on
the
way
to
the
first
tee
it
seemed
to
archie
that
lucille
was
distrait
and
abstracted
in
her
manner
and
it
occurred
to
him
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
what
a
poor
support
a
clear
conscience
is
in
moments
of
crisis
dash
it
all
he
did
see
what
else
he
could
have
done
could
leave
the
poor
female
staggering
about
the
place
with
squads
of
flies
wedged
in
her
eyeball
nevertheless
rotten
thing
getting
a
fly
in
your
eye
he
hazarded
at
length
dashed
awkward
i
or
eh
well
it
a
very
good
way
of
dispensing
with
an
oh
i
say
you
do
mean
you
think
she
a
horrid
woman
absolutely
ca
think
what
people
see
in
well
you
seemed
to
enjoy
fussing
over
her
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
she
inspired
me
with
absolute
the
sort
of
thing
chappies
do
get
inspired
with
you
you
were
beaming
all
over
your
i
was
i
was
just
screwing
up
my
face
because
the
sun
was
in
my
all
sorts
of
things
seem
to
be
in
people
eyes
this
morning
archie
was
saddened
that
this
sort
of
misunderstanding
should
have
occurred
on
such
a
topping
day
and
at
a
moment
when
they
were
to
be
torn
asunder
for
about
hours
made
him
feel
well
it
gave
him
the
pip
he
had
an
idea
that
there
were
words
which
would
have
straightened
everything
out
but
he
was
not
an
eloquent
young
man
and
could
not
find
them
he
felt
aggrieved
lucille
he
considered
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
immune
as
regarded
females
with
flashing
eyes
and
hair
why
dash
it
he
could
have
extracted
flies
from
the
eyes
of
cleopatra
with
one
hand
and
helen
of
troy
with
the
other
simultaneously
without
giving
them
a
second
thought
it
was
in
depressed
mood
that
he
played
a
listless
nine
holes
nor
had
life
brightened
for
him
when
he
came
back
to
the
hotel
two
hours
later
after
seeing
lucille
off
in
the
train
to
new
york
never
till
now
had
they
had
anything
remotely
resembling
a
quarrel
life
archie
felt
was
a
bit
of
a
he
was
disturbed
and
jumpy
and
the
sight
of
miss
silverton
talking
to
somebody
on
a
settee
in
the
corner
of
the
hotel
lobby
sent
him
shooting
off
at
right
angles
and
brought
him
up
with
a
bump
against
the
desk
behind
which
the
sat
the
always
of
a
chatty
disposition
was
saying
something
to
him
but
archie
did
not
listen
he
nodded
mechanically
it
was
something
about
his
room
he
caught
the
word
oh
rather
quite
said
archie
a
fussy
devil
the
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
archie
found
his
room
satisfactory
these
chappies
gassed
on
like
this
so
as
to
try
to
make
you
feel
that
the
management
took
a
personal
interest
in
you
it
was
part
of
their
job
archie
beamed
absently
and
went
in
to
lunch
lucille
empty
seat
stared
at
him
mournfully
increasing
his
sense
of
desolation
he
was
through
his
lunch
when
the
chair
opposite
ceased
to
be
vacant
archie
transferring
his
gaze
from
the
scenery
outside
the
window
perceived
that
his
friend
george
benham
the
playwright
had
materialised
from
nowhere
and
was
now
in
his
midst
hallo
he
said
george
benham
was
a
grave
young
man
whose
spectacles
gave
him
the
look
of
a
mournful
owl
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
besides
the
artistically
straggling
mop
of
black
hair
which
swept
down
over
his
brow
he
sighed
wearily
and
ordered
i
thought
i
saw
you
come
through
the
lobby
just
now
he
said
oh
was
that
you
on
the
settee
talking
to
miss
silverton
she
was
talking
to
me
said
the
playwright
moodily
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
archie
he
could
have
wished
benham
elsewhere
for
he
intruded
on
his
gloom
but
the
chappie
being
amongst
those
present
it
was
only
civil
to
talk
to
him
i
thought
you
were
in
new
york
watching
the
rehearsals
of
your
jolly
old
the
rehearsals
are
hung
up
and
it
looks
as
though
there
was
going
to
be
any
drama
good
lord
cried
george
benham
with
honest
warmth
with
opportunities
opening
out
before
one
on
every
side
with
life
extending
prizes
to
one
with
both
hands
when
you
see
making
fifty
dollars
a
week
and
the
fellows
who
clean
out
the
sewers
going
happy
and
singing
about
their
work
why
does
a
man
deliberately
choose
a
job
like
writing
plays
job
was
the
only
man
that
ever
lived
who
was
really
qualified
to
write
a
play
and
he
would
have
found
it
pretty
tough
going
if
his
leading
woman
had
been
anyone
like
vera
silverton
archie
and
it
was
this
fact
no
doubt
which
accounted
for
his
possession
of
such
a
large
and
varied
circle
of
friends
was
always
able
to
shelve
his
own
troubles
in
order
to
listen
to
other
stories
tell
me
all
laddie
he
said
release
the
film
has
she
walked
out
on
you
left
us
flat
how
did
you
hear
about
it
oh
she
told
you
of
course
archie
hastened
to
try
to
dispel
the
idea
that
he
was
on
any
such
terms
of
intimacy
with
miss
silverton
no
no
my
wife
said
she
thought
it
must
be
something
of
that
nature
or
order
when
we
saw
her
come
in
to
breakfast
i
mean
to
say
said
archie
reasoning
closely
woman
ca
come
into
breakfast
here
and
be
rehearsing
in
new
york
at
the
same
time
why
did
she
administer
the
raspberry
old
friend
benham
helped
himself
to
and
spoke
dully
through
the
steam
well
what
happened
was
this
knowing
her
as
intimately
as
you
do
i
do
know
her
well
anyway
it
was
like
this
as
you
know
she
has
a
dog
i
did
know
she
had
a
dog
protested
archie
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
world
was
in
conspiracy
to
link
him
with
this
woman
well
she
has
a
dog
a
beastly
great
whacking
brute
of
a
bulldog
and
she
brings
it
to
benham
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
in
his
emotion
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
some
degrees
fahrenheit
hotter
than
it
looked
in
the
intermission
caused
by
this
disaster
his
agile
mind
skipped
a
few
chapters
of
the
story
and
when
he
was
able
to
speak
again
he
said
so
then
there
was
a
lot
of
trouble
everything
broke
loose
why
archie
was
puzzled
did
the
management
object
to
her
bringing
the
dog
to
rehearsal
a
lot
of
good
that
would
have
done
she
does
what
she
likes
in
the
then
why
was
there
trouble
you
were
listening
said
benham
reproachfully
i
told
you
this
dog
came
snuffling
up
to
where
i
was
sitting
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
body
of
the
theatre
you
know
and
i
got
up
to
say
something
about
something
that
was
happening
on
the
stage
and
somehow
i
must
have
given
it
a
push
with
my
i
see
said
archie
beginning
to
get
the
run
of
the
plot
you
kicked
her
pushed
it
accidentally
with
my
i
understand
and
when
you
brought
off
this
kick
push
said
benham
austerely
this
kick
or
push
when
you
administered
this
kick
or
push
it
was
more
a
sort
of
light
well
when
you
did
whatever
you
did
the
trouble
started
benham
gave
a
slight
shiver
she
talked
for
a
while
and
then
walked
out
taking
the
dog
with
her
you
see
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
good
lord
do
you
spend
your
whole
time
doing
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
me
the
first
time
it
was
the
he
did
know
whose
dog
it
was
and
it
came
waddling
on
to
the
stage
and
he
gave
it
a
sort
of
pat
a
kind
of
flick
a
slosh
not
a
slosh
corrected
benham
firmly
you
might
call
it
a
tap
with
the
promptscript
well
we
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
smoothing
her
over
that
time
still
we
managed
to
do
it
but
she
said
that
if
anything
of
the
sort
occurred
again
she
would
chuck
up
her
she
must
be
fond
of
the
dog
said
archie
for
the
first
time
feeling
a
touch
of
goodwill
and
sympathy
towards
the
lady
she
crazy
about
it
that
what
made
it
so
awkward
when
i
happened
quite
inadvertently
to
give
it
this
sort
of
accidental
shove
well
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
trying
to
get
her
on
the
at
her
apartment
and
finally
we
heard
that
she
had
come
here
so
i
took
the
next
train
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
come
back
she
listen
and
that
how
matters
pretty
rotten
said
archie
sympathetically
you
can
bet
it
pretty
rotten
for
me
there
nobody
else
who
can
play
the
part
like
a
chump
i
wrote
the
thing
specially
for
her
it
means
the
play
wo
be
produced
at
all
if
she
does
do
it
so
my
last
hope
archie
who
was
lighting
a
cigarette
nearly
swallowed
it
am
i
thought
you
might
persuade
her
point
out
to
her
what
a
lot
hangs
on
her
coming
back
jolly
her
along
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
but
my
dear
old
friend
i
tell
you
i
do
know
her
benham
eyes
opened
behind
their
zareba
of
glass
well
she
knows
you
when
you
came
through
the
lobby
just
now
she
said
that
you
were
the
only
real
human
being
she
had
ever
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
take
a
fly
out
of
her
eye
but
you
did
well
then
the
whole
thing
simple
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
ask
her
how
her
eye
is
and
tell
her
she
has
the
most
beautiful
eyes
you
ever
saw
and
coo
a
but
my
dear
old
son
the
frightful
programme
which
his
friend
had
mapped
out
stunned
archie
i
simply
ca
anything
to
oblige
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
cooing
distinctly
napoo
nonsense
it
is
hard
to
you
do
understand
laddie
you
not
a
married
man
i
mean
to
say
whatever
you
say
for
or
against
marriage
personally
i
all
for
it
and
consider
it
a
ripe
egg
the
fact
remains
that
it
practically
makes
a
chappie
a
spent
force
as
a
cooer
i
do
want
to
dish
you
in
any
way
old
bean
but
i
must
firmly
and
resolutely
decline
to
benham
rose
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
to
be
moving
he
said
i
got
to
get
back
to
new
york
and
report
i
tell
them
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
anything
myself
but
that
i
left
the
matter
in
good
hands
i
know
you
will
do
your
but
laddie
think
said
benham
solemnly
of
all
that
depends
on
it
the
other
actors
the
people
thrown
out
of
a
job
myself
but
no
perhaps
you
had
better
touch
very
lightly
or
not
at
all
on
my
connection
with
the
thing
well
you
know
how
to
handle
it
i
feel
i
can
leave
it
to
you
pitch
it
strong
my
dear
old
man
and
a
thousand
thanks
i
do
the
same
for
you
another
he
moved
towards
the
door
leaving
archie
transfixed
there
he
turned
and
came
back
oh
by
the
way
he
said
my
lunch
have
it
put
on
your
bill
will
you
i
have
time
to
stay
and
settle
chapter
xiii
rallying
round
percy
it
amazed
archie
through
the
whole
of
a
long
afternoon
to
reflect
how
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
the
blue
and
brilliant
sky
of
life
can
cloud
over
and
with
what
abruptness
a
man
who
fancies
that
his
feet
are
on
solid
ground
can
find
himself
immersed
in
fate
gumbo
he
recalled
with
the
bitterness
with
which
one
does
recall
such
things
that
that
morning
he
had
risen
from
his
bed
without
a
care
in
the
world
his
happiness
unruffled
even
by
the
thought
that
lucille
would
be
leaving
him
for
a
short
space
he
had
sung
in
his
bath
yes
he
had
chirruped
like
a
bally
linnet
and
now
some
men
would
have
dismissed
the
unfortunate
affairs
of
george
benham
from
their
mind
as
having
nothing
to
do
with
themselves
but
archie
had
never
been
made
of
this
stern
stuff
the
fact
that
benham
apart
from
being
an
agreeable
companion
with
whom
he
had
lunched
occasionally
in
new
york
had
no
claims
upon
him
affected
him
little
he
hated
to
see
his
fellowman
in
trouble
on
the
other
hand
what
could
he
do
to
seek
miss
silverton
out
and
plead
with
her
even
if
he
did
it
without
cooing
would
undoubtedly
establish
an
intimacy
between
them
which
instinct
told
him
might
tinge
her
manner
after
lucille
return
with
just
that
suggestion
of
auld
lang
syne
which
makes
things
so
awkward
his
whole
being
shrank
from
extending
to
miss
silverton
that
inch
which
the
female
artistic
temperament
is
so
apt
to
turn
into
an
ell
and
when
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
in
to
dinner
he
met
her
in
the
lobby
and
she
smiled
brightly
at
him
and
informed
him
that
her
eye
was
now
completely
recovered
he
shied
away
like
a
startled
mustang
of
the
prairie
and
abandoning
his
intention
of
worrying
the
table
in
the
same
room
with
the
amiable
creature
tottered
off
to
the
where
he
did
the
best
he
could
with
sandwiches
and
coffee
having
got
through
the
time
as
best
he
could
till
eleven
he
went
up
to
bed
the
room
to
which
he
and
lucille
had
been
assigned
by
the
management
was
on
the
second
floor
pleasantly
sunny
by
day
and
at
night
filled
with
cool
and
heartening
fragrance
of
the
pines
hitherto
archie
had
always
enjoyed
taking
a
final
smoke
on
the
balcony
overlooking
the
woods
but
such
was
his
mental
stress
that
he
prepared
to
go
to
bed
directly
he
had
closed
the
door
he
turned
to
the
cupboard
to
get
his
pyjamas
his
first
thought
when
even
after
a
second
scrutiny
no
pyjamas
were
visible
was
that
this
was
merely
another
of
those
things
which
happen
on
days
when
life
goes
wrong
he
raked
the
cupboard
for
a
third
time
with
an
annoyed
eye
from
every
hook
hung
various
garments
of
lucille
but
no
pyjamas
he
was
breathing
a
soft
malediction
preparatory
to
embarking
on
a
hunt
for
his
missing
property
when
something
in
the
cupboard
caught
his
eye
and
held
him
for
a
moment
puzzled
he
could
have
sworn
that
lucille
did
not
possess
a
mauve
neglige
why
she
had
told
him
a
dozen
times
that
mauve
was
a
colour
which
she
did
not
like
he
frowned
perplexedly
and
as
he
did
so
from
near
the
window
came
a
soft
cough
archie
spun
round
and
subjected
the
room
to
as
close
a
scrutiny
as
that
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
cupboard
nothing
was
visible
the
window
opening
on
to
the
balcony
gaped
wide
the
balcony
was
manifestly
empty
urrf
this
time
there
was
no
possibility
of
error
the
cough
had
come
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
window
archie
was
conscious
of
a
pringly
sensation
about
the
roots
of
his
as
he
moved
cautiously
across
the
room
the
affair
was
becoming
uncanny
and
as
he
towards
the
window
old
ghost
stories
read
in
lighter
moments
before
cheerful
fires
with
plenty
of
light
in
the
room
flitted
through
his
mind
he
had
the
feeling
precisely
as
every
chappie
in
those
stories
had
had
that
he
was
not
alone
nor
was
he
in
a
basket
behind
an
curled
up
with
his
massive
chin
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
lay
a
fine
bulldog
urrf
said
the
bulldog
good
god
said
archie
there
was
a
lengthy
pause
in
which
the
bulldog
looked
earnestly
at
archie
and
archie
looked
earnestly
at
the
bulldog
normally
archie
was
a
his
hurry
was
never
so
great
as
to
prevent
him
stopping
when
in
the
street
and
introducing
himself
to
any
dog
he
met
in
a
strange
house
his
first
act
was
to
assemble
the
canine
population
roll
it
on
its
back
or
backs
and
punch
it
in
the
ribs
as
a
boy
his
earliest
ambition
had
been
to
become
a
veterinary
surgeon
and
though
the
years
had
cheated
him
of
his
career
he
knew
all
about
dogs
their
points
their
manners
their
customs
and
their
treatment
in
sickness
and
in
health
in
short
he
loved
dogs
and
had
they
met
under
happier
conditions
he
would
undoubtedly
have
been
on
excellent
terms
with
this
one
within
the
space
of
a
minute
but
as
things
were
he
abstained
from
fraternising
and
continued
to
goggle
dumbly
and
then
his
eye
wandering
aside
collided
with
the
following
objects
a
fluffy
pink
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
an
entirely
strange
and
on
the
bureau
a
photograph
in
a
silver
frame
of
a
stout
gentleman
in
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
in
his
life
much
has
been
written
of
the
emotions
of
the
wanderer
who
returning
to
his
childhood
home
finds
it
altered
out
of
all
recognition
but
poets
have
neglected
the
theme
far
more
poignant
of
the
man
who
goes
up
to
his
room
in
an
hotel
and
finds
it
full
of
somebody
else
and
bulldogs
bulldogs
archie
heart
jumped
sideways
and
upwards
with
a
wiggling
movement
turning
two
somersaults
and
stopped
beating
the
hideous
truth
working
its
way
slowly
through
the
concrete
had
at
last
penetrated
to
his
brain
he
was
not
only
in
somebody
else
room
and
a
woman
at
that
he
was
in
the
room
belonging
to
miss
vera
silverton
he
could
not
understand
it
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
stake
the
last
cent
he
could
borrow
from
his
on
the
fact
that
he
had
made
no
error
in
the
number
over
the
door
yet
nevertheless
such
was
the
case
and
below
par
though
his
faculties
were
at
the
moment
he
was
sufficiently
alert
to
perceive
that
it
behoved
him
to
withdraw
he
leaped
to
the
door
and
as
he
did
so
the
handle
began
to
turn
the
cloud
which
had
settled
on
archie
mind
lifted
abruptly
for
an
instant
he
was
enabled
to
think
about
a
hundred
times
more
quickly
than
was
his
leisurely
wont
good
fortune
had
brought
him
to
within
easy
reach
of
the
switch
he
snapped
it
back
and
was
in
darkness
then
diving
silently
and
swiftly
to
the
floor
he
wriggled
under
the
bed
the
thud
of
his
head
against
what
appeared
to
be
some
sort
of
joist
or
support
unless
it
had
been
placed
there
by
the
maker
as
a
practical
joke
on
the
chance
of
this
kind
of
thing
happening
some
day
coincided
with
the
creak
of
the
opening
door
then
the
light
was
switched
on
again
and
the
bulldog
in
the
corner
gave
a
welcoming
woofle
and
how
is
mamma
precious
angel
rightly
concluding
that
the
remark
had
not
been
addressed
to
himself
and
that
no
social
obligation
demanded
that
he
reply
archie
pressed
his
cheek
against
the
boards
and
said
nothing
the
question
was
not
repeated
but
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
came
the
sound
of
a
patted
dog
did
he
think
his
muzzer
had
fallen
down
dead
and
was
never
coming
up
the
beautiful
picture
which
these
words
conjured
up
filled
archie
with
that
yearning
for
the
which
is
always
so
painful
he
was
finding
his
position
physically
as
well
as
mentally
distressing
it
was
cramped
under
the
bed
and
the
boards
were
harder
than
anything
he
had
ever
encountered
also
it
appeared
to
be
the
practice
of
the
housemaids
at
the
hotel
hermitage
to
use
the
space
below
the
beds
as
a
depository
for
all
the
dust
which
they
swept
off
the
carpet
and
much
of
this
was
insinuating
itself
into
his
nose
and
mouth
the
two
things
which
archie
would
have
liked
most
to
do
at
that
moment
were
first
to
kill
miss
silverton
if
possible
painfully
and
then
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
sneezing
after
a
prolonged
period
he
heard
a
drawer
open
and
noted
the
fact
as
promising
as
the
old
married
man
he
presumed
that
it
signified
the
putting
away
of
about
now
the
dashed
woman
would
be
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
with
her
hair
down
then
she
would
brush
it
then
she
would
twiddle
it
up
into
thingummies
say
ten
minutes
for
this
and
after
that
she
would
go
to
bed
and
turn
out
the
light
and
he
would
be
able
after
giving
her
a
bit
of
time
to
go
to
sleep
to
creep
out
and
leg
it
allowing
at
a
conservative
estimate
of
come
out
archie
stiffened
for
an
instant
a
feeble
hope
came
to
him
that
this
remark
like
the
others
might
be
addressed
to
the
dog
come
out
from
under
that
bed
said
a
stern
voice
and
mind
how
you
come
i
got
a
pistol
well
i
mean
to
say
you
know
said
archie
in
a
propitiatory
voice
emerging
from
his
lair
like
a
tortoise
and
smiling
as
winningly
as
a
man
can
who
has
just
bumped
his
head
against
the
leg
of
a
bed
i
suppose
all
this
seems
fairly
rummy
but
for
the
love
of
mike
said
miss
silverton
the
point
seemed
to
archie
well
taken
and
the
comment
on
the
situation
neatly
expressed
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
well
if
it
comes
to
that
you
know
should
have
mentioned
it
if
you
had
brought
the
subject
up
in
the
course
of
general
what
are
you
doing
in
mine
yours
well
apparently
there
been
a
bloomer
of
some
species
somewhere
but
this
was
the
room
i
had
last
night
said
archie
but
the
said
that
he
had
asked
you
if
it
would
be
quite
satisfactory
to
you
giving
it
up
to
me
and
you
said
yes
i
come
here
every
summer
when
i
not
working
and
i
always
have
this
by
jove
i
remember
now
the
chappie
did
say
something
to
me
about
the
room
but
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
it
rather
went
over
the
top
so
that
what
he
was
talking
about
was
it
miss
silverton
was
frowning
a
director
scanning
her
face
would
have
perceived
that
she
was
registering
disappointment
nothing
breaks
right
for
me
in
this
darned
world
she
said
regretfully
when
i
caught
sight
of
your
leg
sticking
out
from
under
the
bed
i
did
think
that
everything
was
all
lined
up
for
a
real
find
and
at
last
i
could
close
my
eyes
and
see
the
thing
in
the
papers
on
the
front
page
with
photographs
actress
captures
burglar
darn
it
fearfully
sorry
you
know
i
just
needed
something
like
that
i
got
a
and
i
will
say
for
him
that
he
eats
well
and
sleeps
well
and
has
just
enough
intelligence
to
cash
his
monthly
cheque
without
forgetting
what
he
went
into
the
bank
for
but
outside
of
that
you
can
take
it
from
me
he
not
one
of
the
world
workers
he
about
as
much
solid
use
to
a
girl
with
aspirations
as
a
pain
in
the
lower
ribs
it
three
weeks
since
he
got
me
into
print
at
all
and
then
the
brightest
thing
he
could
think
up
was
that
my
favourite
was
an
apple
well
i
ask
you
rotten
said
archie
i
did
think
that
for
once
my
guardian
angel
had
gone
back
to
work
and
was
doing
something
for
me
star
and
midnight
marauder
murmured
miss
silverton
wistfully
favourite
foils
felon
bit
thick
agreed
archie
sympathetically
well
you
probably
be
wanting
to
get
to
bed
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
so
i
may
as
well
be
popping
what
cheerio
a
sudden
gleam
came
into
miss
silverton
compelling
eyes
wait
eh
wait
i
got
an
idea
the
wistful
sadness
had
gone
from
her
manner
she
was
bright
and
alert
sit
down
sit
down
sure
sit
down
and
take
the
chill
off
the
i
thought
of
archie
sat
down
as
directed
at
his
elbow
the
bulldog
eyed
him
gravely
from
the
basket
do
they
know
you
in
this
hotel
know
me
well
i
been
here
about
a
i
mean
do
they
know
who
you
are
do
they
know
you
a
good
citizen
well
if
it
comes
to
that
i
suppose
they
do
but
fine
said
miss
silverton
appreciatively
then
it
all
right
we
can
carry
on
carry
on
why
sure
all
i
want
is
to
get
the
thing
into
the
papers
it
matter
to
me
if
it
turns
out
later
that
there
was
a
mistake
and
that
you
were
a
burglar
trying
for
my
jewels
after
all
it
makes
just
as
good
a
story
either
way
i
ca
think
why
that
never
struck
me
before
here
have
i
been
kicking
because
you
were
a
real
burglar
when
it
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans
whether
you
are
or
not
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
rush
out
and
yell
and
rouse
the
hotel
and
they
come
in
and
pinch
you
and
i
give
the
story
to
the
papers
and
everything
fine
archie
leaped
from
his
chair
i
say
what
what
on
your
mind
enquired
miss
silverton
considerately
you
think
it
a
nifty
scheme
nifty
my
dear
old
soul
it
frightful
ca
see
what
wrong
with
it
grumbled
miss
silverton
after
had
someone
get
new
york
on
the
and
give
the
story
to
the
papers
you
can
explain
and
they
let
you
out
surely
to
goodness
you
do
object
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
to
spending
an
hour
or
two
in
a
cell
why
probably
they
have
got
a
prison
at
all
out
in
these
parts
and
you
simply
be
locked
in
a
room
a
child
of
ten
could
do
it
on
his
head
said
miss
silverton
a
child
of
six
she
emended
but
dash
it
i
mean
what
i
mean
to
say
i
married
yes
said
miss
silverton
with
the
politeness
of
faint
interest
been
married
myself
i
would
say
it
altogether
a
bad
thing
mind
you
for
those
that
like
it
but
a
little
of
it
goes
a
long
way
my
first
husband
she
proceeded
reminiscently
was
a
travelling
man
i
gave
him
a
and
then
i
told
him
to
go
on
travelling
my
second
husband
now
he
was
a
gentleman
in
any
sense
of
the
word
i
remember
once
you
do
grasp
the
point
the
jolly
old
point
you
fail
to
grasp
it
if
this
bally
thing
comes
out
my
wife
will
be
most
frightfully
sick
miss
silverton
regarded
him
with
pained
surprise
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
let
a
little
thing
like
that
stand
in
the
way
of
my
getting
on
the
front
page
of
all
the
papers
with
photographs
where
your
chivalry
never
mind
my
dashed
chivalry
besides
what
does
it
matter
if
she
does
get
a
little
sore
she
soon
get
over
it
you
can
put
that
right
buy
her
a
box
of
candy
not
that
i
strong
for
candy
myself
what
i
always
say
is
it
may
taste
good
but
look
what
it
does
to
your
hips
i
give
you
my
honest
word
that
when
i
gave
up
eating
candy
i
lost
eleven
ounces
the
first
week
my
second
husband
no
i
a
liar
it
was
my
third
my
third
husband
said
say
what
the
big
idea
where
are
you
going
out
said
archie
firmly
bally
out
a
dangerous
light
flickered
in
miss
silverton
eyes
that
be
all
of
that
she
said
raising
the
pistol
you
stay
right
where
you
are
or
i
fire
i
mean
it
my
dear
old
soul
said
archie
in
the
recent
unpleasantness
in
france
i
had
chappies
popping
off
things
like
that
at
me
all
day
and
every
day
for
close
on
five
years
and
here
i
am
what
i
mean
to
say
if
got
to
choose
between
staying
here
and
being
pinched
in
your
room
by
the
local
constabulary
and
having
the
dashed
thing
get
into
the
papers
and
all
sorts
of
trouble
happening
and
my
wife
getting
the
wind
up
and
i
say
if
i
got
to
choose
suck
a
lozenge
and
start
again
said
miss
silverton
well
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
much
rather
take
a
chance
of
getting
a
bullet
in
the
old
bean
than
that
so
loose
it
off
and
the
best
o
luck
miss
silverton
lowered
the
pistol
sank
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
i
think
you
the
meanest
man
i
ever
met
she
sobbed
you
know
perfectly
well
the
bang
would
send
me
into
a
fit
in
that
case
said
archie
relieved
cheerio
good
luck
and
i
be
shifting
yes
you
will
cried
miss
silverton
energetically
recovering
with
amazing
swiftness
from
her
collapse
yes
you
will
i
by
no
means
suppose
you
think
just
because
i
no
champion
with
a
pistol
helpless
you
wait
percy
my
name
is
not
i
never
said
it
was
percy
percy
come
to
muzzer
there
was
a
creaking
rustle
from
behind
the
a
heavy
body
flopped
on
the
carpet
out
into
the
room
heaving
himself
along
as
though
sleep
had
stiffened
his
joints
and
breathing
stertorously
through
his
tilted
nose
moved
the
fine
bulldog
seen
in
the
open
he
looked
even
more
formidable
than
he
had
done
in
his
basket
guard
him
percy
good
dog
guard
him
oh
heavens
what
the
matter
with
him
and
with
these
words
the
emotional
woman
uttering
a
wail
of
anguish
flung
herself
on
the
floor
beside
the
animal
percy
was
indeed
in
manifestly
bad
shape
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
drag
his
limbs
across
the
room
there
was
a
curious
arch
in
his
back
and
as
his
mistress
touched
him
he
cried
out
plaintively
percy
oh
what
is
the
matter
with
him
his
nose
is
burning
now
was
the
time
with
both
sections
of
the
enemy
forces
occupied
for
archie
to
have
departed
softly
from
the
room
but
never
since
the
day
when
at
the
age
of
eleven
he
had
carried
a
large
damp
and
muddy
terrier
with
a
sore
foot
three
miles
and
deposited
him
on
the
best
sofa
in
his
mother
had
he
been
able
to
ignore
the
spectacle
of
a
dog
in
trouble
he
does
look
bad
what
he
dying
oh
he
dying
is
it
distemper
he
never
had
archie
regarded
the
sufferer
with
the
grave
eye
of
the
expert
he
shook
his
head
it
not
that
he
said
dogs
with
distemper
make
a
sort
of
snifting
but
he
is
making
a
snifting
noise
no
he
making
a
snuffling
noise
great
difference
between
snuffling
and
snifting
not
the
same
thing
at
all
i
mean
to
say
when
they
snift
they
snift
and
when
they
snuffle
they
as
it
were
snuffle
that
how
you
can
tell
if
you
ask
me
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
dog
back
percy
uttered
another
cry
i
know
what
the
matter
with
a
brute
of
a
man
kicked
him
at
rehearsal
do
you
think
he
injured
internally
it
rheumatism
said
archie
jolly
old
rheumatism
that
all
the
are
you
sure
absolutely
but
what
can
i
do
give
him
a
good
hot
bath
and
mind
and
dry
him
well
he
have
a
good
sleep
then
and
wo
have
any
pain
then
first
thing
you
want
to
give
him
salicylate
of
i
never
remember
i
write
it
down
for
you
you
ought
to
give
him
from
ten
to
twenty
grains
three
times
a
day
in
an
ounce
of
water
and
rub
him
with
any
good
and
he
wo
die
die
he
live
to
be
as
old
as
you
are
mean
to
say
i
could
kiss
you
said
miss
silverton
emotionally
archie
backed
hastily
no
no
absolutely
not
nothing
like
that
required
really
you
a
darling
yes
i
mean
no
no
no
really
i
do
know
what
to
say
what
can
i
say
good
night
said
archie
i
wish
there
was
something
i
could
do
if
you
had
been
here
i
should
have
gone
off
my
head
a
great
idea
flashed
across
archie
brain
do
you
really
want
to
do
something
anything
then
i
do
wish
like
a
dear
sweet
soul
you
would
pop
straight
back
to
new
york
and
go
on
with
those
miss
silverton
shook
her
head
i
ca
do
that
oh
but
it
is
much
to
ask
what
not
much
to
ask
i
never
forgive
that
man
for
kicking
percy
now
listen
dear
old
soul
you
got
the
story
all
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
jolly
old
benham
told
me
himself
that
he
has
the
greatest
esteem
and
respect
for
percy
and
would
have
kicked
him
for
the
world
and
you
know
it
was
more
a
sort
of
push
than
a
kick
you
might
almost
call
it
a
light
shove
the
fact
is
it
was
beastly
dark
in
the
theatre
and
he
was
legging
it
sideways
for
some
reason
or
other
no
doubt
with
the
best
motives
and
unfortunately
he
happened
to
stub
his
toe
on
the
poor
old
then
why
did
he
say
so
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
you
did
give
him
a
miss
silverton
wavered
i
always
hate
going
back
after
i
walked
out
on
a
show
she
said
it
seems
so
weak
not
a
bit
of
it
they
give
three
hearty
cheers
and
think
you
a
topper
besides
you
got
to
go
to
new
york
in
any
case
to
take
percy
to
a
you
know
what
of
course
how
right
you
always
are
miss
silverton
hesitated
again
would
you
really
be
glad
if
i
went
back
to
the
show
i
go
singing
about
the
hotel
great
pal
of
mine
benham
a
thoroughly
cheery
old
bean
and
very
cut
up
about
the
whole
affair
besides
think
of
all
the
coves
thrown
out
of
work
the
thingummabobs
and
the
poor
very
you
do
it
i
say
you
really
are
one
of
the
best
absolutely
like
mother
made
that
fine
well
i
think
i
be
saying
good
good
night
and
thank
you
so
much
oh
no
rather
not
archie
moved
to
the
door
oh
by
the
yes
if
i
were
you
i
think
i
should
catch
the
very
first
train
you
can
get
to
new
york
you
see
er
you
ought
to
take
percy
to
the
vet
as
soon
as
ever
you
you
really
do
think
of
everything
said
miss
silverton
yes
said
archie
meditatively
chapter
xiv
the
sad
case
of
looney
biddle
archie
was
a
simple
soul
and
as
is
the
case
with
most
simple
souls
gratitude
came
easily
to
him
he
appreciated
kind
treatment
and
when
on
the
following
day
lucille
returned
to
the
hermitage
all
smiles
and
affection
and
made
no
further
reference
to
beauty
eyes
and
the
flies
that
got
into
them
he
was
conscious
of
a
keen
desire
to
show
some
solid
recognition
of
this
magnanimity
few
wives
he
was
aware
could
have
had
the
nobility
and
what
not
to
refrain
from
occasionally
turning
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
the
topics
it
had
not
needed
this
behaviour
on
her
part
to
convince
him
that
lucille
was
a
topper
and
a
corker
and
one
of
the
very
best
for
he
had
been
cognisant
of
these
facts
since
the
first
moment
he
had
met
her
but
what
he
did
feel
was
that
she
deserved
to
be
rewarded
in
no
uncertain
manner
and
it
seemed
a
happy
coincidence
to
him
that
her
birthday
should
be
coming
along
in
the
next
week
or
so
surely
felt
archie
he
could
whack
up
some
sort
of
a
not
unjuicy
gift
for
that
occasion
something
pretty
ripe
that
would
make
a
substantial
hit
with
the
dear
girl
surely
something
would
come
along
to
relieve
his
chronic
impecuniosity
for
just
sufficient
length
of
time
to
enable
him
to
spread
himself
on
this
great
occasion
and
as
if
in
direct
answer
to
prayer
an
almost
forgotten
aunt
in
england
suddenly
out
of
an
absolutely
blue
sky
shot
no
less
a
sum
than
five
hundred
dollars
across
the
ocean
the
present
was
so
lavish
and
unexpected
that
archie
had
the
awed
feeling
of
one
who
participates
in
a
miracle
he
felt
like
herbert
parker
that
the
righteous
was
not
forsaken
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
restored
a
fellow
faith
in
human
nature
for
nearly
a
week
he
went
about
in
a
happy
trance
and
when
by
thrift
and
enterprise
that
is
to
say
by
betting
reggie
van
tuyl
that
the
new
york
giants
would
win
the
opening
game
of
the
series
against
the
pittsburg
baseball
team
he
contrived
to
double
his
capital
what
it
amounted
to
was
simply
that
life
had
nothing
more
to
offer
he
was
actually
in
a
position
to
go
to
a
thousand
dollars
for
birthday
present
he
gathered
in
van
tuyl
of
whose
taste
in
these
matters
he
had
a
high
opinion
and
dragged
him
off
to
a
jeweller
on
broadway
the
jeweller
a
stout
comfortable
man
leaned
on
the
counter
and
fingered
lovingly
the
bracelet
which
he
had
lifted
out
of
its
nest
of
blue
plush
archie
leaning
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
inspected
the
bracelet
searchingly
wishing
that
he
knew
more
about
these
things
for
he
had
rather
a
sort
of
idea
that
the
merchant
was
scheming
to
do
him
in
the
eyeball
in
a
chair
by
his
side
reggie
van
tuyl
half
asleep
as
usual
yawned
despondently
he
had
permitted
archie
to
lug
him
into
this
shop
and
he
wanted
to
buy
something
and
go
any
form
of
sustained
concentration
fatigued
reggie
now
this
said
the
jeweller
i
could
do
at
eight
hundred
and
fifty
grab
it
murmured
van
tuyl
the
jeweller
eyed
him
approvingly
a
man
after
his
own
heart
but
archie
looked
doubtful
it
was
all
very
well
for
reggie
to
tell
him
to
grab
it
in
that
careless
way
reggie
was
a
dashed
millionaire
and
no
doubt
bought
bracelets
by
the
pound
or
the
gross
or
what
not
but
he
himself
was
in
an
entirely
different
position
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
he
said
hesitating
worth
it
mumbled
reggie
van
tuyl
more
than
worth
it
amended
the
jeweller
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
better
value
than
you
could
get
anywhere
on
fifth
yes
said
archie
he
took
the
bracelet
and
twiddled
it
thoughtfully
well
my
dear
old
jeweller
one
ca
say
fairer
than
that
can
one
or
two
as
the
case
may
be
he
frowned
oh
well
all
right
but
rummy
that
women
are
so
fearfully
keen
on
these
little
thingummies
is
it
i
mean
to
say
ca
see
what
they
see
in
them
stones
and
all
that
still
there
it
is
of
course
there
said
the
jeweller
as
you
say
it
is
yes
there
it
is
yes
there
it
is
said
the
jeweller
fortunately
for
people
in
my
line
of
business
will
you
take
it
with
you
sir
archie
reflected
no
no
not
take
it
with
me
the
fact
is
you
know
my
wife
coming
back
from
the
country
and
it
her
birthday
and
the
thing
for
her
and
if
it
was
popping
about
the
place
she
might
see
it
and
it
would
sort
of
spoil
the
surprise
i
mean
to
say
she
does
know
i
giving
it
her
and
all
that
besides
said
reggie
achieving
a
certain
animation
now
that
the
tedious
business
interview
was
concluded
going
to
the
this
afternoon
might
get
pocket
picked
yes
better
have
it
where
shall
i
send
it
sir
eh
oh
shoot
it
along
to
archibald
moffam
at
the
cosmopolis
not
you
know
buzz
it
in
first
thing
having
completed
the
satisfactory
deal
the
jeweller
threw
off
the
business
manner
and
became
chatty
so
you
are
going
to
the
it
should
be
an
interesting
reggie
van
tuyl
now
by
his
own
standards
completely
awake
took
exception
to
this
remark
not
a
bit
of
it
he
said
decidedly
no
contest
ca
call
it
a
contest
walkover
for
the
pirates
archie
was
stung
to
the
quick
there
is
that
about
baseball
which
arouses
enthusiasm
and
the
partisan
spirit
in
the
unlikeliest
bosoms
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
live
in
america
and
not
become
gripped
by
the
game
and
archie
had
long
been
one
of
its
warmest
adherents
he
was
a
supporter
of
the
giants
and
his
only
grievance
against
reggie
in
other
respects
an
estimable
young
man
was
that
the
latter
whose
money
had
been
inherited
from
in
that
city
had
an
absurd
regard
for
the
pirates
of
pittsburg
what
absolute
bally
rot
he
exclaimed
look
what
the
giants
did
to
them
yesterday
yesterday
is
said
reggie
no
it
be
a
jolly
sight
worse
said
archie
looney
biddle
be
pitching
for
the
giants
that
just
what
i
mean
the
pirates
have
got
him
rattled
look
what
happened
last
archie
understood
and
his
generous
nature
chafed
at
the
innuendo
looney
biddle
by
an
affectionately
admiring
public
as
the
result
of
certain
marked
eccentricities
was
beyond
dispute
the
greatest
pitcher
new
york
had
possessed
in
the
last
decade
but
there
was
one
blot
on
biddle
otherwise
stainless
scutcheon
five
weeks
before
on
the
occasion
of
the
giants
invasion
of
pittsburg
he
had
gone
mysteriously
to
pieces
few
partisans
brought
up
to
baseball
from
the
cradle
had
been
plunged
into
a
profounder
gloom
on
that
occasion
than
archie
but
his
soul
revolted
at
the
thought
that
that
sort
of
thing
could
ever
happen
again
i
not
saying
continued
reggie
that
biddle
is
a
very
fair
pitcher
but
it
cruel
to
send
him
against
the
pirates
and
somebody
ought
to
stop
it
his
best
friends
should
interfere
once
a
team
gets
a
pitcher
rattled
he
never
any
good
against
them
again
he
loses
his
the
jeweller
nodded
approval
of
this
sentiment
they
never
come
back
he
said
sententiously
the
fighting
blood
of
the
moffams
was
now
thoroughly
stirred
archie
eyed
his
friend
sternly
reggie
was
a
good
chap
in
many
respects
an
extremely
sound
egg
but
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
talk
rot
of
this
description
about
the
greatest
pitcher
of
the
age
it
seems
to
me
old
companion
he
said
that
a
small
bet
is
indicated
at
this
juncture
how
about
it
do
want
to
take
your
you
wo
have
to
in
the
cool
twilight
of
the
merry
old
summer
evening
i
friend
of
my
youth
and
companion
of
my
riper
years
shall
be
trousering
reggie
yawned
the
day
was
very
hot
and
this
argument
was
making
him
feel
sleepy
again
well
just
as
you
like
of
course
double
or
quits
on
yesterday
bet
if
that
suits
for
a
moment
archie
hesitated
firm
as
his
faith
was
in
stout
left
arm
he
had
not
intended
to
do
the
thing
on
quite
this
scale
that
thousand
dollars
of
his
was
earmarked
for
lucille
birthday
present
and
he
doubted
whether
he
ought
to
risk
it
then
the
thought
that
the
honour
of
new
york
was
in
his
hands
decided
him
besides
the
risk
was
negligible
betting
on
looney
biddle
was
like
betting
on
the
probable
rise
of
the
sun
in
the
east
the
thing
began
to
seem
to
archie
a
rather
unusually
sound
and
conservative
investment
he
remembered
that
the
jeweller
until
he
drew
him
firmly
but
kindly
to
earth
and
urged
him
to
curb
his
exuberance
and
talk
business
on
a
reasonable
plane
had
started
brandishing
bracelets
that
cost
about
two
thousand
there
would
be
time
to
pop
in
at
the
shop
this
evening
after
the
game
and
change
the
one
he
had
selected
for
one
of
those
nothing
was
too
good
for
lucille
on
her
birthday
he
said
make
it
so
old
friend
archie
walked
back
to
the
cosmopolis
no
misgivings
came
to
mar
his
perfect
contentment
he
felt
no
qualms
about
separating
reggie
from
another
thousand
dollars
except
for
a
little
small
change
in
the
possession
of
the
rockefeller
and
vincent
astor
reggie
had
all
the
money
in
the
world
and
could
afford
to
lose
he
hummed
a
gay
air
as
he
entered
the
lobby
and
crossed
to
the
to
buy
a
few
cigarettes
to
see
him
through
the
afternoon
the
girl
behind
the
cigar
counter
welcomed
him
with
a
bright
smile
archie
was
popular
with
all
the
employes
of
the
cosmopolis
a
great
day
moffam
one
of
the
brightest
and
best
agreed
archie
could
you
dig
me
out
two
or
possibly
three
cigarettes
of
the
usual
description
i
shall
want
something
to
smoke
at
the
you
going
to
the
rather
would
miss
it
for
a
no
absolutely
no
not
with
jolly
old
biddle
the
girl
laughed
amusedly
is
he
pitching
this
afternoon
say
that
feller
a
nut
know
him
know
him
well
i
seen
him
pitch
and
so
i
got
a
girl
friend
who
engaged
to
him
archie
looked
at
her
with
positive
respect
it
would
have
been
more
dramatic
of
course
if
she
had
been
engaged
to
the
great
man
herself
but
still
the
mere
fact
that
she
had
a
girl
friend
in
that
astounding
position
gave
her
a
sort
of
halo
no
really
he
said
i
say
by
jove
really
fancy
that
yes
she
engaged
to
him
all
right
been
engaged
close
on
a
coupla
months
i
say
that
frightfully
interesting
fearfully
interesting
really
it
funny
about
that
guy
said
the
girl
he
a
nut
the
fellow
who
said
there
plenty
of
room
at
the
top
must
have
been
thinking
of
gus
biddle
head
he
crazy
about
m
girl
friend
y
know
and
whenever
they
have
a
fuss
it
seems
like
he
sort
of
flies
right
off
the
goes
in
off
the
deep
end
eh
yes
sir
loses
what
little
sense
he
got
why
the
last
time
him
and
m
girl
friend
got
to
scrapping
was
when
he
was
going
on
to
pittsburg
to
play
about
a
month
ago
he
been
out
with
her
the
day
he
left
for
there
and
he
had
a
grouch
or
something
and
he
started
making
low
sneaky
cracks
about
her
uncle
sigsbee
well
m
girl
friend
got
a
nice
disposition
but
she
get
mad
and
she
just
left
him
flat
and
told
him
all
was
over
and
he
went
off
to
pittsburg
and
when
he
started
in
to
pitch
the
opening
game
he
just
could
keep
his
mind
on
his
job
and
look
what
them
assassins
done
to
him
five
runs
in
the
first
innings
yessir
he
a
nut
all
right
archie
was
deeply
concerned
so
this
was
the
explanation
of
that
mysterious
disaster
that
weird
tragedy
which
had
puzzled
the
sporting
press
from
coast
to
coast
good
god
is
he
often
taken
like
that
oh
he
all
right
when
he
has
had
a
fuss
with
m
girl
friend
said
the
girl
indifferently
her
interest
in
baseball
was
tepid
women
are
too
often
like
this
mere
butterflies
with
no
concern
for
the
deeper
side
of
life
yes
but
i
say
what
i
mean
to
say
you
know
are
they
pretty
pally
now
the
good
old
dove
of
peace
flapping
its
little
wings
fairly
briskly
and
all
that
oh
i
guess
everything
nice
and
smooth
just
now
i
seen
m
girl
friend
yesterday
and
gus
was
taking
her
to
the
movies
last
night
so
i
guess
everything
nice
and
archie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
took
her
to
the
movies
did
he
stout
fellow
i
was
at
the
funniest
picture
last
week
said
the
girl
honest
it
was
a
scream
it
was
like
this
archie
listened
politely
then
went
in
to
get
a
bite
of
lunch
his
equanimity
shaken
by
the
discovery
of
the
rift
in
the
peerless
armour
was
restored
good
old
biddle
had
taken
the
girl
to
the
movies
last
night
probably
he
had
squeezed
her
hand
a
goodish
bit
in
the
dark
with
what
result
why
the
fellow
would
be
feeling
like
one
of
those
chappies
who
used
to
joust
for
the
smiles
of
females
in
the
middle
ages
what
he
meant
to
say
presumably
the
girl
would
be
at
the
game
this
afternoon
whooping
him
on
and
good
old
biddle
would
be
so
full
of
beans
and
buck
that
there
would
be
no
holding
him
encouraged
by
these
thoughts
archie
lunched
with
an
untroubled
mind
luncheon
concluded
he
proceeded
to
the
lobby
to
buy
back
his
hat
and
stick
from
the
boy
brigand
with
whom
he
had
left
them
it
was
while
he
was
conducting
this
financial
operation
that
he
observed
that
at
the
which
adjoined
the
alcove
his
friend
behind
the
counter
had
become
engaged
in
conversation
with
another
girl
this
was
a
determined
looking
young
woman
in
a
blue
dress
and
a
large
hat
of
a
bold
and
flowery
species
archie
happening
to
attract
her
attention
she
gave
him
a
glance
out
of
a
pair
of
fine
brown
eyes
then
as
if
she
did
not
think
much
of
him
turned
to
her
companion
and
resumed
their
conversation
which
being
of
an
essentially
private
and
intimate
nature
she
conducted
after
the
manner
of
her
kind
in
a
ringing
soprano
which
penetrated
into
every
corner
of
the
lobby
archie
waiting
while
the
brigand
reluctantly
made
change
for
a
dollar
bill
was
privileged
to
hear
every
word
right
from
the
start
i
seen
he
was
in
a
ugly
mood
you
know
how
he
gets
dearie
chewing
his
upper
lip
and
looking
at
you
as
if
you
were
so
much
dirt
beneath
his
feet
how
was
to
know
he
lost
fifteen
dollars
playing
poker
and
anyway
i
do
see
where
he
gets
a
licence
to
work
off
his
grouches
on
me
and
i
told
him
so
i
said
to
him
i
said
you
ca
be
bright
and
smiling
and
cheerful
when
you
take
me
out
why
do
you
come
round
at
all
was
i
wrong
or
right
dearie
the
girl
behind
the
counter
heartily
endorsed
her
conduct
once
you
let
a
man
think
he
could
use
you
as
a
where
were
you
what
happened
then
honey
well
after
that
we
went
to
the
archie
started
convulsively
the
change
from
his
leaped
in
his
hand
some
of
it
sprang
overboard
and
tinkled
across
the
floor
with
the
brigand
in
pursuit
a
monstrous
suspicion
had
begun
to
take
root
in
his
mind
well
we
got
good
seats
but
well
you
know
how
it
is
once
things
start
going
wrong
you
know
that
hat
of
mine
the
one
with
the
daisies
and
cherries
and
the
feather
i
taken
it
off
and
given
it
him
to
hold
when
we
went
in
and
what
do
you
think
that
done
put
it
on
the
floor
and
crammed
it
under
the
seat
just
to
save
himself
the
trouble
of
holding
it
on
his
lap
and
when
i
showed
him
i
was
upset
all
he
said
was
that
he
was
a
pitcher
and
not
a
hatstand
archie
was
paralysed
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
boy
who
was
trying
to
induce
him
to
accept
to
the
amount
of
cents
his
whole
being
was
concentrated
on
this
frightful
tragedy
which
had
burst
upon
him
like
a
tidal
wave
no
possible
room
for
doubt
remained
gus
was
the
only
gus
in
new
york
that
mattered
and
this
resolute
and
injured
female
before
him
was
the
girl
friend
in
whose
slim
hands
rested
the
happiness
of
new
york
baseball
followers
the
destiny
of
the
unconscious
giants
and
the
fate
of
his
thousand
dollars
a
strangled
croak
proceeded
from
his
parched
lips
well
i
did
say
anything
at
the
moment
it
just
shows
how
them
movies
can
work
on
a
girl
feelings
it
was
a
bryant
washburn
film
and
somehow
whenever
i
see
him
on
the
screen
nothing
else
seems
to
matter
i
just
get
that
feeling
and
could
start
a
fight
if
you
asked
me
to
so
we
go
off
to
have
a
soda
and
i
said
to
him
sure
was
a
lovely
film
gus
and
would
you
believe
me
he
says
straight
out
that
he
did
think
it
was
such
a
much
and
he
thought
bryant
washburn
was
a
pill
a
pill
the
girl
friend
penetrating
voice
shook
with
emotion
he
never
exclaimed
the
shocked
girl
he
did
if
i
die
the
next
moment
i
was
more
than
through
my
vanilla
and
maple
but
i
got
up
without
a
word
and
left
him
and
i
ai
seen
a
sight
of
him
since
so
there
you
are
dearie
was
i
right
or
wrong
the
girl
gave
unqualified
approval
what
men
like
gus
biddle
needed
for
the
salvation
of
their
souls
was
an
occasional
good
jolt
right
where
it
would
do
most
good
i
glad
you
think
i
acted
right
dearie
said
the
girl
friend
i
guess
i
been
too
weak
with
gus
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
i
i
have
to
forgive
him
one
of
these
old
days
but
believe
me
it
wo
be
for
a
the
girl
was
in
favour
of
a
fortnight
no
said
the
girl
friend
regretfully
i
do
believe
i
could
hold
out
that
long
but
if
i
speak
to
him
inside
a
week
well
well
i
got
ta
be
going
goodbye
the
girl
turned
to
attend
to
an
impatient
customer
and
the
girl
friend
walking
with
the
firm
and
decisive
steps
which
indicate
character
made
for
the
leading
to
the
street
and
as
she
went
the
paralysis
which
had
pipped
archie
released
its
hold
still
ignoring
the
cents
which
the
boy
continued
to
proffer
he
leaped
in
her
wake
like
a
panther
and
came
upon
her
just
as
she
was
stepping
into
a
car
the
car
was
full
but
not
too
full
for
archie
he
dropped
his
five
cents
into
the
box
and
reached
for
a
vacant
strap
he
looked
down
upon
the
flowered
hat
there
she
was
and
there
he
was
archie
rested
his
left
ear
against
the
forearm
of
a
long
young
man
in
a
grey
suit
who
had
followed
him
into
the
car
and
was
sharing
his
strap
and
pondered
chapter
xv
summer
storms
of
course
in
a
way
the
thing
was
simple
the
wheeze
was
in
a
sense
straightforward
and
uncomplicated
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
point
out
to
the
injured
girl
all
that
hung
on
her
he
wished
to
touch
her
heart
to
plead
with
her
to
desire
her
to
restate
her
and
to
persuade
her
before
three
when
that
stricken
gentleman
would
be
stepping
into
the
pitcher
box
to
loose
off
the
first
ball
against
the
pittsburg
pirates
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
forgive
augustus
biddle
but
the
blighted
problem
was
how
the
deuce
to
find
the
opportunity
to
start
he
could
yell
at
the
girl
in
a
crowded
and
if
he
let
go
of
his
strap
and
bent
over
her
somebody
would
step
on
his
neck
the
girl
friend
who
for
the
first
five
minutes
had
remained
entirely
concealed
beneath
her
hat
now
sought
diversion
by
looking
up
and
examining
the
faces
of
the
upper
strata
of
passengers
her
eye
caught
archie
in
a
glance
of
recognition
and
he
smiled
feebly
endeavouring
to
register
bonhomie
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
startled
expression
come
into
her
brown
eyes
her
face
turned
pink
at
least
it
was
pink
already
but
it
turned
pinker
the
next
moment
the
car
having
stopped
to
pick
up
more
passengers
she
jumped
off
and
started
to
hurry
across
the
street
archie
was
momentarily
taken
aback
when
embarking
on
this
business
he
had
never
intended
it
to
become
a
blend
of
and
a
chase
he
followed
her
off
the
car
with
a
sense
that
his
grip
on
the
affair
was
slipping
preoccupied
with
these
thoughts
he
did
not
perceive
that
the
long
young
man
who
had
shared
his
strap
had
alighted
too
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
vanishing
figure
of
the
girl
friend
who
having
buzzed
at
a
smart
pace
into
sixth
avenue
was
now
legging
it
in
the
direction
of
the
staircase
leading
to
one
of
the
stations
of
the
elevated
railroad
dashing
up
the
stairs
after
her
he
shortly
afterwards
found
himself
suspended
as
before
from
a
strap
gazing
upon
the
now
familiar
flowers
on
top
of
her
hat
from
another
strap
farther
down
the
carriage
swayed
the
long
young
man
in
the
grey
suit
the
train
rattled
on
once
or
twice
when
it
stopped
the
girl
seemed
undecided
whether
to
leave
or
remain
she
half
rose
then
sank
back
again
finally
she
walked
resolutely
out
of
the
car
and
archie
following
found
himself
in
a
part
of
new
york
strange
to
him
the
inhabitants
of
this
district
appeared
to
eke
out
a
precarious
existence
not
by
taking
in
one
another
washing
but
by
selling
one
another
clothes
archie
glanced
at
his
watch
he
had
lunched
early
but
so
crowded
with
emotions
had
been
the
period
following
lunch
that
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
hour
was
only
just
two
the
discovery
was
a
pleasant
one
with
a
full
hour
before
the
scheduled
start
of
the
game
much
might
be
achieved
he
hurried
after
the
girl
and
came
up
with
her
just
as
she
turned
the
corner
into
one
of
those
forlorn
new
york
which
are
populated
chiefly
by
children
cats
desultory
loafers
and
empty
the
girl
stopped
and
turned
archie
smiled
a
winning
smile
i
say
my
dear
sweet
creature
he
said
i
say
my
dear
old
thing
one
moment
is
that
so
said
the
girl
friend
i
beg
your
pardon
is
that
so
archie
began
to
feel
certain
tremors
her
eyes
were
gleaming
and
her
determined
mouth
had
become
a
perfectly
straight
line
of
scarlet
it
was
going
to
be
difficult
to
be
chatty
to
this
girl
she
was
going
to
be
a
hard
audience
would
mere
words
be
able
to
touch
her
heart
the
thought
suggested
itself
that
properly
speaking
one
would
need
to
use
a
if
you
could
spare
me
a
couples
of
minutes
of
your
valuable
time
say
the
lady
drew
herself
up
menacingly
you
tie
a
can
to
yourself
and
disappear
fade
away
or
i
call
a
cop
archie
was
horrified
at
this
misinterpretation
of
his
motives
one
or
two
children
playing
close
at
hand
and
a
loafer
who
was
trying
to
keep
the
wall
from
falling
down
seemed
pleased
theirs
was
a
colourless
existence
and
to
the
rare
purple
moments
which
had
enlivened
it
in
the
past
the
calling
of
a
cop
had
been
the
unfailing
preliminary
the
loafer
nudged
a
sunning
himself
against
the
same
wall
the
children
abandoning
the
round
which
their
game
had
centred
drew
closer
my
dear
old
soul
said
archie
you
do
understand
do
i
i
know
your
sort
you
trailing
arbutus
no
no
my
dear
old
thing
believe
me
i
would
dream
are
you
going
or
are
you
eleven
more
children
joined
the
ring
of
spectators
the
loafers
stared
silently
like
awakened
crocodiles
but
i
say
listen
i
only
wanted
at
this
point
another
voice
spoke
say
the
word
say
more
almost
than
any
word
in
the
american
language
is
capable
of
a
variety
of
shades
of
expression
it
can
be
genial
it
can
be
jovial
it
can
be
appealing
it
can
also
be
truculent
the
say
which
at
this
juncture
smote
upon
archie
with
a
suddenness
which
made
him
leap
in
the
air
was
truculent
and
the
two
loafers
and
children
who
now
formed
the
audience
were
well
satisfied
with
the
dramatic
development
of
the
performance
to
their
experienced
ears
the
word
had
the
right
ring
archie
spun
round
at
his
elbow
stood
a
long
young
man
in
a
grey
suit
well
said
the
young
man
nastily
and
he
extended
a
large
freckled
face
toward
archie
it
seemed
to
the
latter
as
he
backed
against
the
wall
that
the
young
man
neck
must
be
composed
of
it
appeared
to
be
growing
longer
every
moment
his
face
besides
being
freckled
was
a
dull
in
colour
his
lips
curled
back
in
an
unpleasant
snarl
showing
a
gold
tooth
and
beside
him
swaying
in
an
ominous
sort
of
way
hung
two
clenched
red
hands
about
the
size
of
two
young
legs
of
mutton
archie
eyed
him
with
a
growing
apprehension
there
are
moments
in
life
when
passing
idly
on
our
way
we
see
a
strange
face
look
into
strange
eyes
and
with
a
sudden
glow
of
human
warmth
say
to
ourselves
we
have
found
a
friend
this
was
not
one
of
those
moments
the
only
person
archie
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
who
looked
less
friendly
was
the
who
had
trained
him
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
before
he
had
got
his
commission
i
had
my
eye
on
you
said
the
young
man
he
still
had
his
eye
on
him
it
was
a
hot
eye
and
it
pierced
the
recesses
of
archie
soul
he
backed
a
little
farther
against
the
wall
archie
was
frankly
disturbed
he
was
no
poltroon
and
had
proved
the
fact
on
many
occasions
during
the
days
when
the
entire
german
army
seemed
to
be
picking
on
him
personally
but
he
hated
and
shrank
from
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
bally
public
scene
what
enquired
the
young
man
still
bearing
the
burden
of
the
conversation
and
shifting
his
left
hand
a
little
farther
behind
his
back
do
you
mean
by
following
this
young
lady
archie
was
glad
he
had
asked
him
this
was
precisely
what
he
wanted
to
explain
my
dear
old
lad
he
began
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
asked
a
question
and
presumably
desired
a
reply
the
sound
of
archie
voice
seemed
to
be
more
than
the
young
man
could
endure
it
deprived
him
of
the
last
vestige
of
restraint
with
a
rasping
snarl
he
brought
his
left
fist
round
in
a
sweeping
semicircle
in
the
direction
of
archie
head
archie
was
no
novice
in
the
art
of
since
his
early
days
at
school
he
had
learned
much
from
professors
of
the
science
he
had
been
watching
this
unpleasant
young
man
eyes
with
close
attention
and
the
latter
could
not
have
indicated
his
scheme
of
action
more
clearly
if
he
had
sent
him
a
formal
note
archie
saw
the
swing
all
the
way
he
stepped
nimbly
aside
and
the
fist
crashed
against
the
wall
the
young
man
fell
back
with
a
yelp
of
anguish
gus
screamed
the
girl
friend
bounding
forward
she
flung
her
arms
round
the
injured
man
who
was
ruefully
examining
a
hand
which
always
of
an
was
now
swelling
to
still
further
dimensions
gus
darling
a
sudden
chill
gripped
archie
so
engrossed
had
he
been
with
his
mission
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
pitcher
might
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
follow
the
girl
as
well
in
the
hope
of
putting
in
a
word
for
himself
yet
such
apparently
had
been
the
case
well
this
had
definitely
torn
it
two
loving
hearts
were
united
again
in
complete
reconciliation
but
a
fat
lot
of
good
that
was
it
would
be
days
before
the
misguided
looney
biddle
would
be
able
to
pitch
with
a
hand
like
that
it
looked
like
a
ham
already
and
was
still
swelling
probably
the
wrist
was
sprained
for
at
least
a
week
the
greatest
pitcher
of
his
time
would
be
about
as
much
use
to
the
giants
in
any
professional
capacity
as
a
cold
in
the
head
and
on
that
crippled
hand
depended
the
fate
of
all
the
money
archie
had
in
the
world
he
wished
now
that
he
had
not
thwarted
the
fellow
simple
enthusiasm
to
have
had
his
head
knocked
forcibly
through
a
brick
wall
would
not
have
been
pleasant
but
the
ultimate
outcome
would
not
have
been
as
unpleasant
as
this
with
a
heavy
heart
archie
prepared
to
withdraw
to
be
alone
with
his
sorrow
at
this
moment
however
the
girl
friend
releasing
her
wounded
lover
made
a
sudden
dash
for
him
with
the
plainest
intention
of
blotting
him
from
the
earth
no
i
say
really
said
archie
bounding
backwards
i
mean
to
say
in
a
series
of
events
all
of
which
had
been
a
bit
thick
this
in
his
opinion
achieved
the
maximum
of
thickness
it
was
the
extreme
ragged
outside
edge
of
the
limit
to
brawl
with
a
in
a
public
street
had
been
bad
but
to
be
brawled
with
by
a
girl
the
shot
was
not
on
the
board
absolutely
not
on
the
board
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
it
was
dashed
undignified
no
doubt
for
a
fellow
to
pick
up
the
old
waukeesis
and
leg
it
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
but
there
was
no
other
course
archie
started
to
run
and
as
he
did
so
one
of
the
loafers
made
the
mistake
of
gripping
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
i
got
him
observed
the
is
a
time
for
all
things
this
was
essentially
not
the
time
for
anyone
of
the
male
sex
to
grip
the
collar
of
archie
coat
if
a
syndicate
of
dempsey
carpentier
and
one
of
the
zoo
gorillas
had
endeavoured
to
stay
his
progress
at
that
moment
they
would
have
had
reason
to
consider
it
a
rash
move
archie
wanted
to
be
elsewhere
and
the
blood
of
generations
of
moffams
many
of
whom
had
swung
a
wicked
axe
in
the
of
the
middle
ages
boiled
within
him
at
any
attempt
to
revise
his
plans
there
was
a
good
deal
of
the
loafer
but
it
was
all
soft
releasing
his
hold
when
archie
heel
took
him
shrewdly
on
the
shin
he
received
a
nasty
punch
in
what
would
have
been
the
middle
of
his
waistcoat
if
he
had
worn
one
uttered
a
gurgling
bleat
like
a
wounded
sheep
and
collapsed
against
the
wall
archie
with
a
torn
coat
rounded
the
corner
and
sprinted
down
ninth
avenue
the
suddenness
of
the
move
gave
him
an
initial
advantage
he
was
halfway
down
the
first
block
before
the
vanguard
of
the
pursuit
poured
out
of
the
side
street
continuing
to
travel
well
he
skimmed
past
a
large
dray
which
had
pulled
up
across
the
road
and
moved
on
the
noise
of
those
who
pursued
was
loud
and
clamorous
in
the
rear
but
the
dray
hid
him
momentarily
from
their
sight
and
it
was
this
fact
which
led
archie
the
old
campaigner
to
take
his
next
step
it
was
perfectly
obvious
he
was
aware
of
this
even
in
the
novel
excitement
of
the
chase
that
a
chappie
could
hoof
it
at
miles
an
hour
indefinitely
along
a
main
thoroughfare
of
a
great
city
without
exciting
remark
he
must
take
cover
cover
that
was
the
wheeze
he
looked
about
him
for
cover
you
want
a
nice
suit
it
takes
a
great
deal
to
startle
your
commercial
new
yorker
the
small
tailor
standing
in
his
doorway
seemed
in
no
way
surprised
at
the
spectacle
of
archie
whom
he
had
seen
pass
at
a
conventional
walk
some
five
minutes
before
returning
like
this
at
top
speed
he
assumed
that
archie
had
suddenly
remembered
that
he
wanted
to
buy
something
this
was
exactly
what
archie
had
done
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
what
he
wanted
to
do
now
was
to
get
into
that
shop
and
have
a
long
talk
about
gents
clothing
pulling
himself
up
abruptly
he
shot
past
the
small
tailor
into
the
dim
interior
a
confused
aroma
of
cheap
clothing
greeted
him
except
for
a
small
oasis
behind
a
grubby
counter
practically
all
the
available
space
was
occupied
by
suits
stiff
suits
looking
like
the
body
when
discovered
by
the
police
hung
from
hooks
limp
suits
with
the
appearance
of
having
swooned
from
exhaustion
lay
about
on
chairs
and
boxes
the
place
was
a
cloth
morgue
a
sargasso
sea
of
serge
archie
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
in
these
quiet
groves
of
clothing
a
regiment
could
have
lain
hid
something
nifty
in
tweeds
enquired
the
proprietor
of
this
haven
following
him
amiably
into
the
shop
or
maybe
yes
a
nice
serge
say
mister
i
got
a
sweet
thing
in
blue
serge
that
fit
you
like
the
paper
on
the
wall
archie
wanted
to
talk
about
clothes
but
not
yet
i
say
laddie
he
said
hurriedly
lend
me
your
ear
for
half
a
jiffy
outside
the
baying
of
the
pack
had
become
imminent
stow
me
away
for
a
moment
in
the
undergrowth
and
i
buy
anything
you
he
withdrew
into
the
jungle
the
noise
outside
grew
in
volume
the
pursuit
had
been
delayed
for
a
priceless
few
instants
by
the
arrival
of
another
dray
moving
northwards
which
had
drawn
level
with
the
first
dray
and
dexterously
bottled
up
the
fairway
this
obstacle
had
now
been
overcome
and
the
original
searchers
their
ranks
swelled
by
a
few
dozen
more
of
the
leisured
classes
were
hot
on
the
trail
again
you
done
a
murder
enquired
the
voice
of
the
proprietor
mildly
interested
filtering
through
a
wall
of
cloth
well
boys
will
be
boys
he
said
philosophically
see
anything
there
that
you
like
there
some
sweet
things
there
i
inspecting
them
narrowly
replied
archie
if
you
do
let
those
chappies
find
me
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
bought
one
said
the
proprietor
with
a
touch
of
austerity
two
said
archie
quickly
or
possibly
three
or
the
proprietor
cordiality
returned
you
ca
have
too
many
nice
suits
he
said
approvingly
not
a
young
feller
like
you
that
wants
to
look
nice
all
the
nice
girls
like
a
young
feller
that
dresses
nice
when
you
go
out
of
here
in
a
suit
i
got
hanging
up
there
at
the
back
the
girls
be
all
over
you
like
flies
round
a
would
you
mind
said
archie
would
you
mind
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
old
companion
not
mentioning
that
word
he
broke
off
a
heavy
foot
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
shop
say
uncle
said
a
deep
voice
one
of
those
beastly
voices
that
only
the
most
poisonous
blighters
have
you
seen
a
young
feller
run
past
here
young
feller
the
proprietor
appeared
to
reflect
do
you
mean
a
young
feller
in
blue
with
a
homburg
hat
that
the
duck
we
lost
him
where
did
he
go
him
why
he
come
running
past
quick
as
he
could
go
i
wondered
what
he
was
running
for
a
hot
day
like
this
he
went
round
the
corner
at
the
bottom
of
the
there
was
a
silence
well
i
guess
he
got
away
said
the
voice
regretfully
the
way
he
was
travelling
agreed
the
proprietor
i
would
be
surprised
if
he
was
in
europe
by
this
you
want
a
nice
suit
the
other
curtly
expressing
a
wish
that
the
proprietor
would
go
to
eternal
perdition
and
take
his
entire
stock
with
him
stumped
out
this
said
the
proprietor
tranquilly
burrowing
his
way
to
where
archie
stood
and
exhibiting
a
outrage
which
appeared
to
be
a
poor
relation
of
the
flannel
family
would
put
you
back
fifty
dollars
and
cheap
fifty
dollars
sixty
i
said
i
do
speak
always
archie
regarded
the
distressing
garment
with
a
shuddering
horror
a
young
man
with
an
educated
taste
in
clothes
it
got
right
in
among
his
nerve
centres
but
honestly
old
soul
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
that
is
a
suit
it
just
a
regrettable
incident
the
proprietor
turned
to
the
door
in
a
listening
attitude
i
believe
i
hear
that
feller
coming
back
he
said
archie
gulped
how
about
trying
it
on
he
said
i
not
sure
after
all
it
fairly
that
the
way
to
talk
said
the
proprietor
cordially
you
try
it
on
you
ca
judge
a
suit
not
a
real
nice
suit
like
this
by
looking
at
it
you
want
to
put
it
on
there
he
led
the
way
to
a
dusty
mirror
at
the
back
of
the
shop
is
that
a
bargain
at
seventy
dollars
why
say
your
mother
would
be
proud
if
she
could
see
her
boy
now
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
proprietor
lovingly
kneading
a
little
sheaf
of
currency
bills
eyed
with
a
fond
look
the
heap
of
clothes
which
lay
on
the
counter
as
nice
a
little
lot
as
i
ever
had
in
my
shop
archie
did
not
deny
this
it
was
he
thought
probably
only
too
true
i
only
wish
i
could
see
you
walking
up
fifth
avenue
in
them
rhapsodised
the
proprietor
you
give
a
treat
what
you
going
to
do
with
carry
under
your
arm
archie
shuddered
strongly
well
then
i
can
send
for
you
anywhere
you
like
it
all
the
same
to
me
where
i
send
archie
meditated
the
future
was
black
enough
as
it
was
he
shrank
from
the
prospect
of
being
confronted
next
day
at
the
height
of
his
misery
with
these
appalling
an
idea
struck
him
yes
send
he
said
what
the
name
and
address
daniel
brewster
said
archie
hotel
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
given
his
a
present
archie
went
out
into
the
street
and
began
to
walk
pensively
down
a
now
peaceful
ninth
avenue
out
of
the
depths
that
covered
him
black
as
the
pit
from
pole
to
pole
no
single
ray
of
hope
came
to
cheer
him
he
could
not
like
the
poet
thank
whatever
gods
there
be
for
his
unconquerable
soul
for
his
soul
was
licked
to
a
splinter
he
felt
alone
and
friendless
in
a
rotten
world
with
the
best
intentions
he
had
succeeded
only
in
landing
himself
squarely
amongst
the
ribstons
why
had
he
not
been
content
with
his
wealth
instead
of
risking
it
on
that
blighted
bet
with
reggie
why
had
he
trailed
the
girl
friend
dash
her
he
might
have
known
that
he
would
only
make
an
ass
of
himself
and
because
he
had
done
so
looney
biddle
left
hand
that
priceless
left
hand
before
which
opposing
batters
quailed
and
wilted
was
out
of
action
resting
in
a
sling
careened
like
a
damaged
battleship
and
any
chance
the
giants
might
have
had
of
beating
the
pirates
was
gone
gone
as
surely
as
that
thousand
dollars
which
should
have
bought
a
birthday
present
for
lucille
a
birthday
present
for
lucille
he
groaned
in
bitterness
of
spirit
she
would
be
coming
back
dear
girl
all
smiles
and
happiness
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
give
her
tomorrow
and
when
dawned
all
he
would
be
able
to
give
her
would
be
a
kind
smile
a
nice
state
of
things
a
jolly
situation
a
thoroughly
good
egg
he
did
not
think
it
seemed
to
archie
that
nature
contrary
to
her
usual
custom
of
indifference
to
human
suffering
was
mourning
with
him
the
sky
was
overcast
and
the
sun
had
ceased
to
shine
there
was
a
sort
of
sombreness
in
the
afternoon
which
fitted
in
with
his
mood
and
then
something
splashed
on
his
face
it
says
much
for
archie
that
his
first
thought
as
after
a
few
scattered
drops
as
though
the
clouds
were
submitting
samples
for
approval
the
whole
sky
suddenly
began
to
stream
like
a
was
that
this
was
simply
an
additional
infliction
which
he
was
called
upon
to
bear
on
top
of
all
his
other
troubles
he
would
get
soaked
to
the
skin
or
have
to
hang
about
in
some
doorway
he
cursed
richly
and
sped
for
shelter
the
rain
was
setting
about
its
work
in
earnest
the
world
was
full
of
that
rending
swishing
sound
which
accompanies
the
more
violent
summer
storms
thunder
crashed
and
lightning
flicked
out
of
the
grey
heavens
out
in
the
street
the
raindrops
bounded
up
off
the
stones
like
fairy
fountains
archie
surveyed
them
morosely
from
his
refuge
in
the
entrance
of
a
shop
and
then
suddenly
like
one
of
those
flashes
which
were
lighting
up
the
gloomy
sky
a
thought
lit
up
his
mind
by
jove
if
this
keeps
up
there
wo
be
a
with
trembling
fingers
he
pulled
out
his
watch
the
hands
pointed
to
five
minutes
to
three
a
blessed
vision
came
to
him
of
a
moist
and
disappointed
crowd
receiving
up
at
the
polo
grounds
switch
it
on
you
blighters
he
cried
addressing
the
leaden
clouds
switch
it
on
more
and
more
it
was
shortly
before
five
that
a
young
man
bounded
into
a
jeweller
shop
near
the
hotel
cosmopolis
a
young
man
who
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
coat
was
torn
near
the
collar
and
that
he
oozed
water
from
every
inch
of
his
drenched
clothes
appeared
in
the
highest
it
was
only
when
he
spoke
that
the
jeweller
recognised
in
the
human
sponge
the
immaculate
youth
who
had
looked
in
that
morning
to
order
a
bracelet
i
say
old
lad
said
this
young
man
you
remember
that
jolly
little
you
showed
me
before
lunch
the
bracelet
sir
as
you
observe
with
a
manly
candour
which
does
you
credit
my
dear
old
jeweller
the
bracelet
well
produce
exhibit
and
bring
it
forth
would
you
mind
trot
it
out
slip
it
across
on
a
lordly
dish
you
wished
me
surely
to
put
it
aside
and
send
it
to
the
cosmopolis
the
young
man
tapped
the
jeweller
earnestly
on
his
substantial
chest
what
i
wished
and
what
i
wish
now
are
two
bally
separate
and
dashed
distinct
things
friend
of
my
college
days
never
put
off
till
what
you
can
do
and
all
that
i
not
taking
any
more
chances
not
for
me
for
others
yes
but
not
for
archibald
here
are
the
doubloons
produce
the
jolly
bracelet
thanks
the
jeweller
counted
the
notes
with
the
same
unction
which
archie
had
observed
earlier
in
the
day
in
the
proprietor
of
the
the
process
made
him
genial
a
nasty
wet
day
sir
it
been
he
observed
chattily
archie
shook
his
head
old
friend
he
said
you
all
wrong
far
otherwise
and
not
a
bit
like
it
my
dear
old
trafficker
in
gems
you
put
your
finger
on
the
one
aspect
of
this
blighted
that
really
deserves
credit
and
respect
rarely
in
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
have
i
encountered
a
day
so
absolutely
bally
in
nearly
every
shape
and
form
but
there
was
one
thing
that
saved
it
and
that
was
its
merry
old
wetness
laddie
good
evening
sir
said
the
jeweller
chapter
xvi
archie
accepts
a
situation
lucille
moved
her
wrist
slowly
round
the
better
to
examine
the
new
bracelet
you
really
are
an
angel
angel
she
murmured
like
it
said
archie
complacently
like
it
why
it
gorgeous
it
must
have
cost
a
oh
nothing
to
speak
of
just
a
few
pieces
of
eight
just
a
few
doubloons
from
the
old
oak
but
i
did
know
there
were
any
doubloons
in
the
old
oak
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
admitted
archie
at
one
point
in
the
proceedings
there
were
but
an
aunt
of
mine
in
england
peace
be
on
her
head
happened
to
send
me
a
chunk
of
the
necessary
at
what
you
might
call
the
psychological
and
you
spent
it
all
on
a
birthday
present
for
me
archie
lucille
gazed
at
her
husband
adoringly
archie
do
you
know
what
i
think
what
you
the
perfect
man
no
really
what
ho
yes
said
lucille
firmly
i
long
suspected
it
and
now
i
know
i
do
think
there
anybody
like
you
in
the
archie
patted
her
hand
it
a
rummy
thing
he
observed
but
your
father
said
almost
exactly
that
to
me
only
yesterday
only
i
do
fancy
he
meant
the
same
as
you
to
be
absolutely
frank
his
exact
expression
was
that
he
thanked
god
there
was
only
one
of
a
troubled
look
came
into
lucille
grey
eyes
it
a
shame
about
father
i
do
wish
he
appreciated
you
but
you
must
be
too
hard
on
me
said
archie
hard
on
your
father
well
dash
it
all
i
think
i
treat
him
with
what
you
might
call
actual
brutality
what
i
mean
to
say
my
whole
idea
is
rather
to
keep
out
of
the
old
lad
way
and
curl
up
in
a
ball
if
i
ca
dodge
him
i
just
as
soon
be
hard
on
a
stampeding
elephant
i
would
for
the
world
say
anything
derogatory
as
it
were
to
your
jolly
old
pater
but
there
is
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
he
by
way
of
being
one
of
our
leading
fishes
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
he
considers
that
you
let
down
the
proud
old
name
of
brewster
a
bit
when
you
brought
me
in
and
laid
me
on
the
anyone
would
be
lucky
to
get
you
for
a
i
fear
me
light
of
my
life
the
dad
does
see
eye
to
eye
with
you
on
that
point
no
every
time
i
get
hold
of
a
daisy
i
give
him
another
chance
but
it
always
works
out
at
loves
me
not
you
must
make
allowances
for
him
but
i
hope
devoutly
that
he
does
catch
me
at
it
i
a
sort
of
idea
that
if
the
old
dad
discovered
that
i
was
making
allowances
for
him
he
would
have
from
ten
to
fifteen
he
worried
just
now
you
i
did
know
he
does
confide
in
me
he
worried
about
that
what
waiter
queen
of
my
soul
a
man
called
salvatore
father
dismissed
him
some
time
salvatore
probably
you
do
remember
him
he
used
to
wait
on
this
why
and
father
dismissed
him
apparently
and
now
there
all
sorts
of
trouble
you
see
father
wants
to
build
this
new
hotel
of
his
and
he
thought
he
got
the
site
and
everything
and
could
start
building
right
away
and
now
he
finds
that
this
man
salvatore
mother
owns
a
little
newspaper
and
tobacco
shop
right
in
the
middle
of
the
site
and
no
way
of
getting
him
out
without
buying
the
shop
and
he
wo
sell
at
least
he
made
his
mother
promise
that
she
wo
a
boy
best
friend
is
his
mother
said
archie
approvingly
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
all
along
so
father
in
archie
drew
at
his
cigarette
meditatively
i
remember
a
chappie
a
policeman
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
incidentally
a
fairly
pronounced
blighter
remarking
to
me
some
time
ago
that
you
could
trample
on
the
poor
man
face
but
you
must
be
surprised
if
he
bit
you
in
the
leg
while
you
were
doing
it
apparently
this
is
what
has
happened
to
the
old
dad
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
all
along
that
old
friend
salvatore
would
come
out
strong
in
the
end
if
you
only
gave
him
time
brainy
sort
of
feller
great
pal
of
small
face
lightened
she
gazed
at
archie
with
proud
affection
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
the
one
to
solve
this
difficulty
you
wonderful
darling
is
he
really
a
friend
of
yours
absolutely
many
the
time
he
and
i
have
chatted
in
this
very
then
it
all
right
if
you
went
to
him
and
argued
with
him
he
would
agree
to
sell
the
shop
and
father
would
be
happy
think
how
grateful
father
would
be
to
you
it
would
make
all
the
archie
turned
this
over
in
his
mind
something
in
that
he
agreed
it
would
make
him
see
what
a
pet
lambkin
you
really
are
well
said
archie
i
bound
to
say
that
any
scheme
which
what
you
might
call
culminates
in
your
father
regarding
me
as
a
pet
lambkin
ought
to
receive
one
best
attention
how
much
did
he
offer
salvatore
for
his
shop
i
do
know
there
is
call
him
over
and
ask
archie
glanced
over
to
where
brewster
had
sunk
moodily
into
a
chair
at
a
neighbouring
table
it
was
plain
even
at
that
distance
that
daniel
brewster
had
his
troubles
and
was
bearing
them
with
an
ill
grace
he
was
scowling
absently
at
the
you
call
him
said
archie
having
inspected
his
formidable
relative
you
know
him
let
go
over
to
they
crossed
the
room
lucille
sat
down
opposite
her
draped
himself
over
a
chair
in
the
background
father
dear
said
lucille
archie
has
got
an
archie
said
brewster
incredulously
this
is
me
said
archie
indicating
himself
with
a
spoon
the
tall
what
new
is
he
up
to
now
it
a
splendid
idea
father
he
wants
to
help
you
over
your
new
wants
to
run
it
for
me
i
suppose
by
jove
said
archie
reflectively
that
not
a
bad
scheme
i
never
thought
of
running
an
hotel
i
should
mind
taking
a
stab
at
he
has
thought
of
a
way
of
getting
rid
of
salvatore
and
his
for
the
first
time
brewster
interest
in
the
conversation
seemed
to
stir
he
looked
sharply
at
his
he
has
has
he
he
said
archie
balanced
a
roll
on
a
fork
and
inserted
a
plate
underneath
the
roll
bounded
away
into
a
corner
sorry
said
archie
my
fault
absolutely
i
owe
you
a
roll
i
sign
a
bill
for
it
oh
about
this
sportsman
salvatore
well
it
like
this
you
know
he
and
i
are
great
pals
i
known
him
for
years
and
years
at
least
it
seems
like
years
and
years
lu
was
suggesting
that
i
seek
him
out
in
his
lair
and
ensnare
him
with
my
diplomatic
manner
and
superior
brain
power
and
what
it
was
your
idea
precious
said
lucille
brewster
was
much
as
it
went
against
the
grain
to
have
to
admit
it
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
this
what
do
you
propose
to
do
become
a
jolly
old
ambassador
how
much
did
you
offer
the
chappie
three
thousand
dollars
twice
as
much
as
the
place
is
worth
holding
out
on
me
for
ah
but
how
did
you
offer
it
to
him
what
i
mean
to
say
i
bet
you
got
your
lawyer
to
write
him
a
letter
full
of
whereases
peradventures
and

it
from
your
uncle
archibald
i
a
student
of
human
nature
and
i
know
a
thing
or
that
not
much
growled
brewster
who
was
finding
his
superior
manner
a
little
trying
now
do
interrupt
father
said
lucille
severely
ca
you
see
that
archie
is
going
to
be
tremendously
clever
in
a
minute
he
got
to
show
me
what
you
ought
to
do
said
archie
is
to
let
me
go
and
see
him
taking
the
stuff
in
crackling
bills
i
roll
them
about
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
that
fetch
him
he
prodded
brewster
encouragingly
with
a
roll
i
tell
you
what
to
do
give
me
three
thousand
of
the
best
and
crispest
and
i
undertake
to
buy
that
shop
it
ca
fail
laddie
do
call
me
laddie
brewster
pondered
very
well
he
said
at
last
i
did
know
you
had
so
much
sense
he
added
grudgingly
oh
positively
said
archie
beneath
a
rugged
exterior
i
hide
a
brain
like
a
sense
i
exude
it
laddie
i
drip
with
there
were
moments
during
the
ensuing
days
when
brewster
permitted
himself
to
hope
but
more
frequent
were
the
moments
when
he
told
himself
that
a
pronounced
chump
like
his
could
not
fail
somehow
to
make
a
mess
of
the
negotiations
his
relief
therefore
when
archie
curveted
into
his
private
room
and
announced
that
he
had
succeeded
was
great
you
really
managed
to
make
that
wop
sell
out
archie
brushed
some
papers
off
the
desk
with
a
careless
gesture
and
seated
himself
on
the
vacant
spot
absolutely
i
spoke
to
him
as
one
old
friend
to
another
sprayed
the
bills
all
over
the
place
and
he
sang
a
few
bars
from
and
signed
on
the
dotted
you
not
such
a
fool
as
you
look
owned
brewster
archie
scratched
a
match
on
the
desk
and
lit
a
cigarette
it
a
jolly
little
shop
he
said
i
took
quite
a
fancy
to
it
full
of
newspapers
do
you
know
and
cheap
novels
and
some
sort
of
chocolates
and
cigars
with
the
most
fearfully
attractive
labels
i
think
i
make
a
success
of
it
it
bang
in
the
middle
of
a
dashed
good
neighbourhood
one
of
these
days
somebody
will
be
building
a
big
hotel
round
about
there
and
that
help
trade
a
lot
i
look
forward
to
ending
my
days
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
with
a
full
set
of
white
whiskers
and
a
beloved
by
everybody
everybody
say
you
must
patronise
that
quaint
delightful
old
blighter
he
quite
a
character
brewster
air
of
grim
satisfaction
had
given
way
to
a
look
of
discomfort
almost
of
alarm
he
presumed
his
was
merely
indulging
in
badinage
but
even
so
his
words
were
not
soothing
well
i
much
obliged
he
said
that
infernal
shop
was
holding
up
everything
now
i
can
start
building
right
archie
raised
his
eyebrows
but
my
dear
old
top
i
sorry
to
spoil
your
daydreams
and
stop
you
chasing
rainbows
and
all
that
but
are
you
forgetting
that
the
shop
belongs
to
me
i
do
at
all
know
that
i
want
to
sell
either
i
gave
you
the
money
to
buy
that
shop
and
dashed
generous
of
you
it
was
too
admitted
archie
unreservedly
it
was
the
first
money
you
ever
gave
me
and
i
shall
always
tell
interviewers
that
it
was
you
who
founded
my
fortunes
some
day
when
the
king
i
tell
the
world
all
about
it

my
brewster
rose
dangerously
from
his
seat
do
you
think
you
can
hold
me

archie
the
way
i
look

after

to
become
one
of
the
world

a
living

now
i
see
a
way
to
repay
you
for
your
confidence
and
encouragement
you
look
me
up
sometimes
at
the
good
old
shop
wo

slid
off

table
and
moved
towards
the
door

while

there
was
a
pause
while
brewster
chewed
three
inches
off
a
very
well
he
said
at
last
topping
said
archie
i
knew

brewster

in
his

badly
and
going
to

brother
bill
romance
her
eyes
said
bill
brewster
are
like
like
what
the
word
i
want
he
looked
across
at
lucille
and
archie
lucille
was
leaning
forward
with
an
eager
and
interested
face
archie
was
leaning
back
with
his
together
and
his
eyes
closed
this
was
not
the
first
time
since
their
meeting
in
beale
auction
rooms
that
his
had
touched
on
the
subject
of
the
girl
he
had
become
engaged
to
marry
during
his
trip
to
england
indeed
brother
bill
had
touched
on
very
little
else
and
archie
though
of
a
sympathetic
nature
and
fond
of
his
young
relative
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
had
heard
all
he
wished
to
hear
about
mabel
winchester
lucille
on
the
other
hand
was
absorbed
her
brother
recital
had
thrilled
her
like
said
bill
like
stars
suggested
lucille
stars
said
bill
gratefully
exactly
the
word
twin
stars
shining
in
a
clear
sky
on
a
summer
night
her
teeth
are
like
what
shall
i
say
pearls
pearls
and
her
hair
is
a
lovely
brown
like
leaves
in
autumn
in
fact
concluded
bill
slipping
down
from
the
heights
with
something
of
a
jerk
she
a
corker
is
she
archie
archie
opened
his
eyes
quite
right
old
top
he
said
it
was
the
only
thing
to
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
demanded
bill
coldly
he
had
been
suspicious
all
along
of
archie
statement
that
he
could
listen
better
with
his
eyes
shut
eh
oh
sorry
thinking
of
something
you
were
no
no
positively
and
distinctly
not
frightfully
interested
and
rapt
and
all
that
only
i
did
quite
get
what
you
i
said
that
mabel
was
a
oh
absolutely
in
every
there
bill
turned
to
lucille
triumphantly
you
hear
that
and
archie
has
only
seen
her
photograph
wait
till
he
sees
her
in
the
my
dear
old
chap
said
archie
shocked
ladies
present
i
mean
to
say
what
i
afraid
that
father
will
be
the
one
you
find
it
hard
to
yes
admitted
her
brother
gloomily
your
mabel
sounds
perfectly
charming
but
well
you
know
what
father
is
it
is
a
pity
she
sings
in
the
much
of
a
voice
argued
bill
in
extenuation
all
the
same
archie
the
conversation
having
reached
a
topic
on
which
he
considered
himself
one
of
the
greatest
living
authorities
to
wit
the
unlovable
disposition
of
his
addressed
the
meeting
as
one
who
has
a
right
to
be
heard
lucille
absolutely
right
old
absolutely
your
esteemed
progenitor
is
a
pretty
tough
nut
and
it
no
good
trying
to
get
away
from
i
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
old
bird
but
if
you
come
bounding
in
with
part
of
the
personnel
of
the
ensemble
on
your
arm
and
try
to
dig
a
father
blessing
out
of
him
he
extremely
apt
to
stab
you
in
the
i
wish
said
bill
annoyed
you
would
talk
as
though
mabel
were
the
ordinary
kind
of
she
only
on
the
stage
because
her
mother
and
she
wants
to
educate
her
little
i
say
said
archie
concerned
take
my
tip
old
top
in
chatting
the
matter
over
with
the
pater
do
dwell
too
much
on
that
aspect
of
the
i
been
watching
him
closely
and
it
about
all
he
can
stick
having
to
support
me
if
you
ring
in
a
mother
and
a
little
brother
on
him
he
crack
under
the
well
i
got
to
do
something
about
it
mabel
will
be
over
here
in
a
great
scot
you
never
told
us
yes
she
going
to
be
in
the
new
billington
show
and
naturally
she
will
expect
to
meet
my
family
i
told
her
all
about
did
you
explain
father
to
her
asked
lucille
well
i
just
said
she
must
mind
him
as
his
bark
was
worse
than
his
well
said
archie
thoughtfully
he
has
bitten
me
yet
so
you
may
be
right
but
you
got
to
admit
that
he
a
bit
of
a
lucille
considered
really
bill
i
think
your
best
plan
would
be
to
go
straight
to
father
and
tell
him
the
whole
you
do
want
him
to
hear
about
it
in
a
roundabout
the
trouble
is
that
whenever
i
with
father
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
archie
found
himself
envying
his
this
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
for
where
he
himself
was
concerned
there
had
been
no
lack
of
eloquence
on
bill
part
in
the
brief
period
in
which
he
had
known
him
bill
had
talked
all
the
time
and
always
on
the
one
topic
as
unpromising
a
subject
as
the
tariff
laws
was
easily
diverted
by
him
into
a
discussion
of
the
absent
mabel
when
i
with
father
said
bill
i
sort
of
lose
my
nerve
and
dashed
awkward
said
archie
politely
he
sat
up
suddenly
i
say
by
jove
i
know
what
you
want
old
friend
just
thought
of
it
that
busy
brain
is
never
still
explained
lucille
saw
it
in
the
paper
this
morning
an
advertisement
of
a
book
do
you
i
no
time
for
you
time
for
reading
this
one
laddie
for
you
ca
afford
to
miss
it
it
a
book
what
i
mean
to
say
is
if
you
read
it
and
take
its
tips
to
heart
it
guarantees
to
make
you
a
convincing
talker
the
advertisement
says
so
the
advertisement
all
about
a
chappie
whose
name
i
forget
whom
everybody
loved
because
he
talked
so
well
and
mark
you
before
he
got
hold
of
this
book
the
personality
that
wins
was
the
name
of
it
if
i
remember
rightly
he
was
known
to
all
the
lads
in
the
office
as
silent
samuel
or
something
or
it
may
have
been
thomas
well
one
day
he
happened
by
good
luck
to
blow
in
the
necessary
for
the
good
old
that
and
now
whenever
they
want
someone
to
go
and
talk
rockefeller
or
someone
into
lending
them
a
million
or
so
they
send
for
samuel
only
now
they
call
him
sammy
the
and
fawn
upon
him
pretty
copiously
and
all
that
how
about
it
old
son
how
do
we
go
what
perfect
nonsense
said
lucille
i
do
know
said
bill
plainly
impressed
there
might
be
something
in
absolutely
said
archie
i
remember
it
said
convincingly
and
no
man
will
ever
treat
you
with
cold
unresponsive
indifference
well
cold
unresponsive
indifference
is
just
what
you
do
want
the
pater
to
treat
you
with
is
it
or
is
it
or
is
it
what
i
mean
what
it
sounds
all
right
said
bill
it
is
all
right
said
archie
it
a
scheme
i
go
farther
it
an
egg
the
idea
i
had
said
bill
was
to
see
if
i
could
get
mabel
a
job
in
some
straight
comedy
that
would
take
the
curse
off
the
thing
a
bit
then
i
would
have
to
dwell
on
the
chorus
end
of
the
business
you
much
more
sensible
said
lucille
but
what
of
a
sweat
argued
archie
i
mean
to
say
having
to
pop
round
and
nose
about
and
all
are
you
willing
to
take
a
little
trouble
for
your
stricken
worm
said
lucille
severely
oh
absolutely
my
idea
was
to
get
this
book
and
coach
the
dear
old
chap
rehearse
him
do
you
know
he
could
bone
up
the
early
chapters
a
bit
and
then
drift
round
and
try
his
convincing
talk
on
it
might
be
a
good
idea
said
bill
reflectively
well
i
tell
you
what
going
to
do
said
lucille
i
going
to
get
bill
to
introduce
me
to
his
mabel
and
if
she
as
nice
as
he
says
she
is
go
to
father
and
talk
convincingly
to
you
an
ace
said
bill
absolutely
agreed
archie
cordially
my
partner
what
all
the
same
we
ought
to
keep
the
book
as
a
second
string
you
know
i
mean
to
say
you
are
a
young
and
delicately
nurtured
girl
full
of
sensibility
and
shrinking
and
all
that
and
you
know
what
the
jolly
old
pater
is
he
might
bark
at
you
and
put
you
out
of
action
in
the
first
round
well
then
if
anything
like
that
happened
do
you
see
we
could
unleash
old
bill
the
trained
expert
and
let
him
have
a
shot
personally
i
all
for
the
that
me
too
said
bill
lucille
looked
at
her
watch
good
gracious
it
nearly
one
no
archie
heaved
himself
up
from
his
chair
well
it
a
shame
to
break
up
this
feast
of
reason
and
flow
of
soul
and
all
that
but
if
we
do
leg
it
with
some
speed
we
shall
be
we
lunching
at
the
nicholson
explained
lucille
to
her
brother
i
wish
you
were
coming
lunch
bill
shook
his
head
with
a
kind
of
tolerant
scorn
lunch
means
nothing
to
me
these
days
i
other
things
to
think
of
besides
he
looked
as
spiritual
as
his
rugged
features
would
permit
i
written
to
her
yet
but
dash
it
old
scream
if
she
going
to
be
over
here
in
a
week
what
the
good
of
writing
the
letter
would
cross
i
not
mailing
my
letters
to
said
bill
i
keeping
them
for
her
to
read
when
she
my
sainted
aunt
said
archie
devotion
like
this
was
something
beyond
his
outlook
chapter
xviii
the
sausage
chappie
the
personality
that
wins
cost
archie
two
dollars
in
cash
and
a
lot
of
embarrassment
when
he
asked
for
it
at
the
store
to
buy
a
treatise
of
that
name
would
automatically
seem
to
argue
that
you
have
a
winning
personality
already
and
archie
was
at
some
pains
to
explain
to
the
girl
behind
the
counter
that
he
wanted
it
for
a
friend
the
girl
seemed
more
interested
in
his
english
accent
than
in
his
explanation
and
archie
was
uncomfortably
aware
as
he
receded
that
she
was
practising
it
in
an
undertone
for
the
benefit
of
her
colleagues
and
however
what
is
a
little
discomfort
if
endured
in
friendship
name
he
was
proceeding
up
broadway
after
leaving
the
store
when
he
encountered
reggie
van
tuyl
who
was
drifting
along
in
somnambulistic
fashion
near
street
hullo
reggie
old
thing
said
archie
hullo
said
reggie
a
man
of
few
words
i
just
been
buying
a
book
for
bill
brewster
went
on
archie
it
appears
that
old
bill
what
the
matter
he
broke
off
his
recital
abruptly
a
sort
of
spasm
had
passed
across
his
companion
features
the
hand
holding
archie
arm
had
tightened
convulsively
one
would
have
said
that
reginald
had
received
a
shock
it
nothing
said
reggie
i
all
right
now
i
caught
sight
of
that
fellow
clothes
rather
suddenly
they
shook
me
a
bit
i
all
right
now
he
said
bravely
archie
following
his
friend
gaze

tuyl
was
never
at
his
strongest
in
the
morning
and
he
had
a
sensitive
eye
for
clothes
he
had
been
known
to
resign
from
clubs
because
members
exceeded
the
bounds
in
the
matter
of
soft
shirts
with
and
the
short
man
who
was
standing
just
in
front
of
them
in
attitude
of
restful
immobility
was
certainly
no
dandy
his
best
friend
could
not
have
called
him
dapper
take
him
for
all
in
all
and
on
the
hoof
he
might
have
been
posing
as
a
model
for
a
sketch
of
what
the
man
should
not
wear
in
costume
as
in
most
other
things
it
is
best
to
take
a
definite
line
and
stick
to
it
this
man
had
obviously
vacillated
his
neck
was
swathed
in
a
green
scarf
he
wore
an
coat
and
his
lower
limbs
were
draped
in
a
pair
of
tweed
trousers
built
for
a
larger
man
to
the
north
he
was
bounded
by
a
straw
hat
to
the
south
by
brown
shoes
archie
surveyed
the
man
back
carefully
bit
thick
he
said
sympathetically
but
of
course
broadway
fifth
avenue
what
i
mean
to
say
is
bohemian
licence
and
what
not
broadway
crammed
with
deuced
brainy
devils
who
do
care
how
they
look
probably
this
bird
is
a
of
some
all
the
same
man
no
right
to
wear
coat
with
tweed
absolutely
not
i
see
what
you
at
this
point
the
sartorial
offender
turned
seen
from
the
front
he
was
even
more
unnerving
he
appeared
to
possess
no
shirt
though
this
defect
was
offset
by
the
fact
that
the
tweed
trousers
fitted
snugly
under
the
arms
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
at
his
best
he
could
never
have
been
that
and
in
the
recent
past
he
had
managed
to
acquire
a
scar
that
ran
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
across
his
cheek
even
when
his
face
was
in
repose
he
had
an
odd
expression
and
when
as
he
chanced
to
do
now
he
smiled
odd
became
a
mild
adjective
quite
inadequate
for
purposes
of
description
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
face
however
unquestionably
genial
indeed
there
was
something
in
it
that
had
a
quality
of
humorous
appeal
archie
started
he
stared
at
the
man
memory
stirred
great
scot
he
cried
it
the
sausage
chappie
reginald
van
tuyl
gave
a
little
moan
he
was
not
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
a
sensitive
young
man
as
regarded
scenes
archie
behaviour
unmanned
him
for
archie
releasing
his
arm
had
bounded
forward
and
was
shaking
the
other
hand
warmly
well
well
well
my
dear
old
chap
you
must
remember
me
what
no
yes
the
man
with
the
scar
seemed
puzzled
he
shuffled
the
brown
shoes
patted
the
straw
hat
and
eyed
archie
questioningly
i
do
seem
to
place
you
he
said
archie
slapped
the
back
of
the
coat
he
linked
his
arm
affectionately
with
that
of
the
we
met
outside
st
mihiel
in
the
war
you
gave
me
a
bit
of
sausage
one
of
the
most
sporting
events
in
history
nobody
but
a
real
sportsman
would
have
parted
with
a
bit
of
sausage
at
that
moment
to
a
stranger
never
forgotten
it
by
jove
saved
my
life
absolutely
had
chewed
a
morsel
for
eight
hours
well
have
you
got
anything
on
i
mean
to
say
you
are
booked
for
lunch
or
any
rot
of
that
species
are
you
fine
then
i
move
we
all
toddle
off
and
get
a
bite
he
squeezed
the
other
arm
fondly
fancy
meeting
you
again
like
this
i
often
wondered
what
became
of
you
but
by
jove
i
was
forgetting
dashed
rude
of
me
my
friend
van
reggie
gulped
the
longer
he
looked
at
it
the
harder
this
man
costume
was
to
bear
his
eye
passed
shudderingly
from
the
brown
shoes
to
the
tweed
trousers
to
the
green
scarf
from
the
green
scarf
to
the
straw
hat
sorry
he
mumbled
just
remembered
important
date
late
already
er
see
you
some
time
he
melted
away
a
broken
man
archie
was
not
sorry
to
see
him
go
reggie
was
a
good
chap
but
he
would
undoubtedly
have
been
de
trop
at
this
reunion
i
vote
we
go
to
the
cosmopolis
he
said
steering
his
friend
through
the
crowd
the
browsing
and
sluicing
is
bad
there
and
i
can
sign
the
bill
which
is
no
small
consideration
the
sausage
chappie
chuckled
amusedly
i
ca
go
to
a
place
like
the
cosmopolis
looking
like
archie
was
a
little
embarrassed
oh
i
do
know
you
know
do
you
know
he
said
still
since
you
have
brought
the
topic
up
you
did
get
the
good
old
wardrobe
a
bit
mixed
this
morning
what
i
mean
to
say
you
seem
as
it
were
to
have
got
hold
of
samples
from
a
good
number
of
your
various
suitings
how
do
you
mean
suitings
i
have
any
suitings
who
do
you
think
i
am
vincent
astor
all
i
have
is
what
i
stand
up
archie
was
shocked
this
tragedy
touched
him
he
himself
had
never
had
any
money
in
his
life
but
somehow
he
had
always
seemed
to
manage
to
have
plenty
of
clothes
how
this
was
he
could
not
say
he
had
always
had
a
vague
sort
of
idea
that
tailors
were
kindly
birds
who
never
failed
to
have
a
pair
of
trousers
or
something
up
their
sleeve
to
present
to
the
deserving
there
was
the
drawback
of
course
that
once
they
had
given
you
things
they
were
apt
to
write
you
rather
a
lot
of
letters
about
it
but
you
soon
managed
to
recognise
their
handwriting
and
then
it
was
a
simple
task
to
extract
their
communications
from
your
morning
mail
and
drop
them
in
the
basket
this
was
the
first
case
he
had
encountered
of
a
man
who
was
really
short
of
clothes
my
dear
old
lad
he
said
briskly
this
must
be
remedied
oh
positively
this
must
be
remedied
at
once
i
suppose
my
things
fit
you
no
well
i
tell
you
what
we
wangle
something
from
my
old
brewster
you
know
the
fellow
who
runs
the
cosmopolis
his
fit
you
like
the
paper
on
the
wall
because
a
tubby
little
blighter
too
what
i
mean
to
say
is
he
also
one
of
those
sturdy
square
chappies
of
about
the
middle
height
by
the
way
where
are
you
stopping
these
days
nowhere
just
at
present
i
thought
of
taking
one
of
those
park
are
you
broke
am
i
archie
was
concerned
you
ought
to
get
a
i
ought
but
somehow
i
do
seem
able
what
did
you
do
before
the
war
i
forgotten
how
do
you
mean
forgotten
you
ca
mean
forgotten
yes
it
quite
but
i
mean
to
say
you
ca
have
forgotten
a
thing
like
ca
i
i
forgotten
all
sorts
of
things
where
i
was
born
how
old
i
am
whether
i
married
or
single
what
my
name
is
well
i
dashed
said
archie
staggered
but
you
remembered
about
giving
me
a
bit
of
sausage
outside
mihiel
no
i
did
i
taking
your
word
for
it
for
all
i
know
you
may
be
luring
me
into
some
den
to
rob
me
of
my
straw
hat
i
do
know
you
from
adam
but
i
like
your
conversation
especially
the
part
about
eating
and
i
taking
a
archie
was
concerned
listen
old
bean
make
an
effort
you
must
remember
that
sausage
episode
it
was
just
outside
mihiel
about
five
in
the
evening
your
little
lot
were
lying
next
to
my
little
lot
and
we
happened
to
meet
and
i
said
ho
and
you
said
and
i
said
ho
what
ho
and
you
said
a
bit
of
sausage
and
i
said
ho
what
ho
what
ho
the
dialogue
seems
to
have
been
darned
sparkling
but
i
do
remember
it
it
must
have
been
after
that
that
i
stopped
one
i
do
seem
quite
to
have
caught
up
with
myself
since
i
got
oh
that
how
you
got
that
scar
no
i
got
that
jumping
through
a
window
in
london
on
armistice
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
oh
i
do
know
it
seemed
a
good
idea
at
the
but
if
you
can
remember
a
thing
like
that
why
ca
you
remember
your
name
i
remember
everything
that
happened
after
i
came
out
of
hospital
the
part
before
that
archie
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
i
know
just
what
you
want
you
need
a
bit
of
quiet
and
repose
to
think
things
over
and
so
forth
you
must
go
sleeping
on
park
benches
do
at
all
not
a
bit
like
it
you
must
shift
to
the
cosmopolis
it
half
a
bad
spot
the
old
cosmop
i
did
like
it
much
the
first
night
i
was
there
because
there
was
a
dashed
tap
that
went
all
night
and
kept
me
awake
but
the
place
has
its
is
the
cosmopolis
giving
free
board
and
lodging
these
days
rather
that
be
all
right
well
this
is
the
spot
we
start
by
trickling
up
to
the
old
boy
suite
and
looking
over
his
i
know
the
waiter
on
his
floor
a
very
sound
chappie
he
let
us
in
with
his
and
so
it
came
about
that
daniel
brewster
returning
to
his
suite
in
the
middle
of
lunch
in
order
to
find
a
paper
dealing
with
the
subject
he
was
discussing
with
his
guest
the
architect
of
his
new
hotel
was
aware
of
a
murmur
of
voices
behind
the
closed
door
of
his
bedroom
recognising
the
accents
of
his
he
breathed
an
oath
and
charged
in
he
objected
to
archie
wandering
at
large
about
his
suite
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
when
he
opened
the
door
did
nothing
to
soothe
him
the
floor
was
a
sea
of
clothes
there
were
coats
on
the
chairs
trousers
on
the
bed
shirts
on
the
bookshelf
and
in
the
middle
of
his
welter
stood
archie
with
a
man
who
to
brewster
heated
eye
looked
like
a
tramp
comedian
out
of
a
burlesque
show
great
godfrey
ejaculated
brewster
archie
looked
up
with
a
friendly
smile
oh
he
said
affably
we
were
just
glancing
through
your
spare
scenery
to
see
if
we
could
find
something
for
my
pal
here
this
is
brewster
my
old
archie
scanned
his
relative
twisted
features
something
in
his
expression
seemed
not
altogether
encouraging
he
decided
that
the
negotiations
had
better
be
conducted
in
private
one
moment
old
lad
he
said
to
his
new
friend
i
just
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
my
in
the
other
room
just
a
little
friendly
business
chat
you
stay
in
the
other
room
brewster
turned
on
archie
like
a
wounded
lion
of
the
desert
what
the
archie
secured
one
of
his
and
began
to
massage
it
affectionately
ought
to
have
explained
said
archie
only
did
want
to
interrupt
your
lunch
the
sportsman
on
the
horizon
is
a
dear
old
pal
of
mine
brewster
wrenched
himself
free
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
you
worm
by
bringing
tramps
into
my
bedroom
and
messing
about
with
my
clothes
that
just
what
i
trying
to
explain
if
you
only
listen
this
bird
is
a
bird
i
met
in
france
during
the
war
he
gave
me
a
bit
of
sausage
outside
mihiel
damn
you
and
him
and
the
sausage
absolutely
but
listen
he
ca
remember
who
he
is
or
where
he
was
born
or
what
his
name
is
and
he
broke
so
dash
it
i
must
look
after
him
you
see
he
gave
me
a
bit
of
brewster
frenzy
gave
way
to
an
ominous
calm
i
give
him
two
seconds
to
clear
out
of
here
if
he
is
gone
by
then
i
have
him
thrown
archie
was
shocked
you
do
mean
that
i
do
mean
but
where
is
he
to
go
but
you
do
understand
this
chappie
has
lost
his
memory
because
he
was
wounded
in
the
war
keep
that
fact
firmly
fixed
in
the
old
bean
he
fought
for
you
fought
and
bled
for
you
bled
profusely
by
jove
and
he
saved
my
life
if
i
got
nothing
else
against
him
that
would
be
but
you
ca
sling
a
chappie
out
into
the
cold
hard
world
who
bled
in
gallons
to
make
the
world
safe
for
the
hotel
brewster
looked
ostentatiously
at
his
watch
two
seconds
he
said
there
was
a
silence
archie
appeared
to
be
thinking
he
said
at
last
no
need
to
get
the
wind
up
i
know
where
he
can
go
it
just
occurred
to
me
i
put
him
up
at
my
little
the
purple
ebbed
from
brewster
face
such
was
his
emotion
that
he
had
forgotten
that
infernal
shop
he
sat
down
there
was
more
silence
oh
gosh
said
brewster
i
knew
you
would
be
reasonable
about
it
said
archie
approvingly
now
honestly
as
man
to
man
how
do
we
go
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
growled
brewster
i
thought
you
might
put
the
chappie
up
for
a
while
and
give
him
a
chance
to
look
round
and
nose
about
a
i
absolutely
refuse
to
give
any
more
loafers
free
board
and
any
more
well
he
would
be
the
second
would
he
archie
looked
pained
it
true
he
said
that
when
i
first
came
here
i
was
temporarily
resting
so
to
speak
but
did
i
go
right
out
and
grab
the
managership
of
your
new
hotel
positively
i
will
not
adopt
this
well
find
him
a
job
what
sort
of
a
job
oh
any
old
sort
he
can
be
a
waiter
if
he
all
right
i
put
the
matter
before
he
returned
to
the
bedroom
the
sausage
chappie
was
gazing
fondly
into
the
mirror
with
a
spotted
tie
draped
round
his
neck
i
say
old
top
said
archie
apologetically
the
emperor
of
the
blighters
out
yonder
says
you
can
have
a
job
here
as
waiter
and
he
wo
do
another
dashed
thing
for
you
how
about
it
do
waiters
eat
i
suppose
so
though
by
jove
come
to
think
of
it
i
never
seen
one
at
that
good
enough
for
me
said
the
sausage
chappie
when
do
i
begin
chapter
xix
reggie
comes
to
life
the
advantage
of
having
plenty
of
time
on
one
hands
is
that
one
has
leisure
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
all
one
circle
of
friends
and
archie
assiduously
as
he
watched
over
the
destinies
of
the
sausage
chappie
did
not
neglect
the
romantic
needs
of
his
bill
a
few
days
later
lucille
returning
one
morning
to
their
mutual
suite
found
her
husband
seated
in
an
upright
chair
at
the
table
an
unusually
stern
expression
on
his
amiable
face
a
large
cigar
was
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
the
fingers
of
one
hand
rested
in
the
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
with
the
other
hand
he
tapped
menacingly
on
the
table
as
she
gazed
upon
him
wondering
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
lucille
was
suddenly
aware
of
bill
presence
he
had
emerged
sharply
from
the
bedroom
and
was
walking
briskly
across
the
floor
he
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
table
father
said
bill
archie
looked
up
sharply
frowning
heavily
over
his
cigar
well
my
boy
he
said
in
a
strange
rasping
voice
what
is
it
speak
up
my
boy
speak
up
why
the
devil
ca
you
speak
up
this
is
my
busy
day
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
asked
lucille
archie
waved
her
away
with
the
large
gesture
of
a
man
of
blood
and
iron
interrupted
while
concentrating
leave
us
woman
we
would
be
alone
retire
into
the
jolly
old
background
and
amuse
yourself
for
a
bit
read
a
book
do
acrostics
charge
ahead
father
said
bill
again
yes
my
boy
yes
what
is
it
father
archie
picked
up
the
volume
that
lay
on
the
table
half
a
mo
old
son
sorry
to
stop
you
but
i
knew
there
was
something
i
just
remembered
your
walk
all
wrong
all
wrong
all
wrong
where
the
chapter
on
the
art
of
walking
here
we
are
listen
dear
old
soul
drink
this
in
walking
one
should
strive
to
acquire
that
swinging
easy
movement
from
the
hips
the
walker
seems
to
float
along
as
it
were
now
old
bean
you

two
minutes

he
turned
to
lucille
notice
him
float
along
that
time
absolutely
skimmed
what
lucille
had
taken
a
seat
was
waiting
for
enlightenment
are
you
and
bill
going
into
vaudeville
she
asked
archie
closely
had
further
criticism
to
make
man
of
and
he
read
erect
in
an
easy
natural
graceful
attitude

not
too
far
apart

to
the

your
gaze

it
out
of

what
i
said
before

in
somewhat
and
above
all
not

have
you
got
all
that
yes
you
look
all
right
carry
on
laddie
carry
on
have
of
the
dynamic
voice
and
the
tone
of
authority
some
of
the
full
rich
round
stuff
we
hear
so
much
about
bill
fastened
a
gimlet
eye
upon
his
and
drew
a
deep
breath
father
he
said
father
you
have
to
brighten
up
bill
dialogue
a
lot
said
lucille
critically
or
you
will
never
get
father
i
mean
it
all
right
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
sort
of
monotonous
besides
one
of
you
ought
to
be
asking
questions
and
the
other
answering
bill
ought
to
be
saying
was
that
lady
i
saw
you
coming
down
the
street
with
so
that
you
would
be
able
to
say
was
a
lady
that
was
my
wife
i
know
i
been
to
lots
of
vaudeville
bill
relaxed
his
attitude
he
deflated
his
chest
spread
his
heels
and
ceased
to
draw
in
his
abdomen
we
better
try
this
another
time
when
we
alone
he
said
frigidly
i
ca
do
myself
why
do
you
want
to
do
yourself
justice
asked
lucille
said
archie
affably
casting
off
his
forbidding
expression
like
a
garment
rehearsal
postponed
i
was
just
putting
old
bill
through
it
he
explained
with
a
view
to
getting
him
into
form
for
the
jolly
old
oh
lucille
voice
was
the
voice
of
one
who
sees
light
in
darkness
when
bill
walked
in
like
a
cat
on
hot
bricks
and
stood
there
looking
stuffed
that
was
just
the
personality
that
wins
that
was
well
you
could
blame
me
for
not
recognising
it
could
you
archie
patted
her
head
paternally
a
little
less
of
the
caustic
critic
stuff
he
said
bill
will
be
all
right
on
the
night
if
you
had
come
in
then
and
put
him
off
his
stroke
he
have
shot
out
some
amazing
stuff
full
of
authority
and
dynamic
accents
and
what
not
i
tell
you
light
of
my
soul
old
bill
is
all
right
he
got
the
winning
personality
up
a
tree
ready
whenever
he
wants
to
go
and
get
it
speaking
as
his
backer
and
trainer
i
think
he
twist
your
father
round
his
little
finger
absolutely
it
surprise
me
if
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
the
good
old
dad
started
pumping
through
hoops
and
sitting
up
for
lumps
of
it
would
surprise
ah
that
because
you
have
seen
old
bill
in
action
you
crabbed
his
act
before
he
had
begun
to
spread
it
is
that
at
all
the
reason
why
i
think
that
bill
however
winning
his
personality
may
be
wo
persuade
father
to
let
him
marry
a
girl
in
the
chorus
is
something
that
happened
last
last
night
well
at
three
this
morning
it
on
the
front
page
of
the
early
editions
of
the
evening
papers
i
brought
one
in
for
you
to
see
only
you
were
so
busy
look
there
it
is
archie
seized
the
paper
oh
great
scot
what
is
it
asked
bill
irritably
do
stand
goggling
there
what
the
devil
is
it
listen
to
this
old
thing
revelry
by
night
spirited
battle
royal
at
hotel
cosmopolis
the
hotel
detective
had
a
good
heart
but
pauline
packed
the
punch
the
logical
contender
for
jack
dempsey
championship
honours
has
been
discovered
and
in
an
age
where
women
are
stealing
men
jobs
all
the
time
it
will
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
our
readers
to
learn
that
she
belongs
to
the
sex
that
is
more
deadly
than
the
male
her
name
is
miss
pauline
preston
and
her
wallop
is
vouched
for
under
oath
under
many
oaths
by
timothy
known
to
his
intimates
as
who
holds
down
the
arduous
job
of
detective
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
at
three
this
morning
was
advised
by
the
that
the
occupants
of
every
room
within
earshot
of
number
had
the
desk
to
complain
of
a
disturbance
a
noise
a
vocal
uproar
proceeding
from
the
room
mentioned
thither
therefore
marched
his
face
full
of
for
he
had
been
indulging
in
an
early
breakfast
or
a
late
supper
and
his
heart
of
devotion
to
duty
he
found
there
the
misses
pauline
preston
and
bobbie
clair
of
the
personnel
of
the
chorus
of
the
frivolities
entertaining
a
few
friends
of
either
sex
a
pleasant
time
was
being
had
by
all
and
at
the
moment
of
entry
the
entire
strength
of
the
company
was
rendering
with
considerable
emphasis
that
touching
ballad
there
a
place
for
me
in
heaven
for
my
is
the
able
and
efficient
officer
at
once
suggested
that
there
was
a
place
for
them
in
the
street
and
the
was
there
and
being
a
man
of
action
as
well
as
words
proceeded
to
gather
up
an
armful
of
assorted
guests
as
a
preliminary
to
a
tour
onto
the
cold
night
it
was
at
this
point
that
miss
preston
stepped
into
the
limelight
contends
that
she
hit
him
with
a
brick
an
iron
casing
and
the
singer
building
be
that
as
it
may
her
efforts
were
sufficiently
able
to
induce
him
to
retire
for
reinforcements
which
arriving
arrested
the
regardless
of
age
or
sex
at
the
this
morning
miss
preston
maintained
that
she
and
her
friends
were
merely
having
a
quiet
and
that
was
no
gentleman
the
male
guests
gave
their
names
respectively
as
woodrow
wilson
david
and
william
bryan
these
however
are
believed
to
be
incorrect
but
the
moral
is
if
you
want
excitement
rather
than
sleep
stay
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
bill
may
have
quaked
inwardly
as
he
listened
to
this
epic
but
outwardly
he
was
unmoved
well
he
said
what
about
it
what
about
it
said
lucille
what
about
it
said
archie
why
my
dear
old
friend
it
simply
means
that
all
the
time
we
been
putting
in
making
your
personality
winning
has
been
chucked
away
absolutely
a
dead
loss
we
might
just
as
well
have
read
a
manual
on
how
to
knit
i
do
see
it
maintained
bill
stoutly
lucille
turned
apologetically
to
her
husband
you
must
judge
me
by
him
archie
darling
this
sort
of
thing
does
run
in
the
are
supposed
to
be
rather
bright
on
the
whole
but
poor
bill
was
dropped
by
his
nurse
when
he
was
a
baby
and
fell
on
his
i
suppose
what
you
driving
at
said
the
goaded
bill
is
that
what
has
happened
will
make
father
pretty
sore
against
girls
who
happen
to
be
in
the
chorus
that
absolutely
it
old
thing
i
sorry
to
say
the
next
person
who
mentions
the
word
in
the
jolly
old
governor
presence
is
going
to
take
his
life
in
his
hands
i
tell
you
as
one
man
to
another
that
i
much
rather
be
back
in
france
hopping
over
the
top
than
do
it
what
darned
nonsense
mabel
may
be
in
the
chorus
but
she
is
like
those
poor
old
bill
said
lucille
i
awfully
sorry
but
it
no
use
not
facing
facts
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
reputation
of
the
hotel
is
the
thing
father
cares
more
about
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
that
this
is
going
to
make
him
furious
with
all
the
in
creation
it
no
good
trying
to
explain
to
him
that
your
mabel
is
in
the
chorus
but
not
of
the
chorus
so
to
deuced
well
put
said
archie
approvingly
you
absolutely
right
a
by
the
river
brim
so
to
speak
a
simple
is
to
him
as
it
were
and
she
is
nothing
more
if
you
know
what
i
so
now
said
lucille
having
shown
you
that
the
imbecile
scheme
which
you
concocted
with
my
poor
husband
is
no
good
at
all
i
will
bring
you
words
of
cheer
your
own
original
plan
of
getting
your
mabel
a
part
in
a
comedy
was
always
the
best
one
and
you
can
do
it
i
would
have
broken
the
bad
news
so
abruptly
if
i
had
had
some
consolation
to
give
you
afterwards
i
met
reggie
van
tuyl
just
now
wandering
about
as
if
the
cares
of
the
world
were
on
his
shoulders
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
putting
up
most
of
the
money
for
a
new
play
that
going
into
rehearsal
right
away
reggie
an
old
friend
of
yours
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
to
get
your
mabel
a
small
part
there
sure
to
be
a
maid
or
something
with
only
a
line
or
two
that
wo
a
ripe
scheme
said
archie
very
sound
and
fruity
the
cloud
did
not
lift
from
bill
corrugated
brow
that
all
very
well
he
said
but
you
know
what
a
talker
reggie
is
he
an
obliging
sort
of
chump
but
his
tongue
fastened
on
at
the
middle
and
waggles
at
both
ends
i
do
want
the
whole
of
new
york
to
know
about
my
engagement
and
have
somebody
spilling
the
news
to
father
before
i
that
all
right
said
lucille
archie
can
speak
to
him
there
no
need
for
him
to
mention
your
name
at
all
he
can
just
say
there
a
girl
he
wants
to
get
a
part
for
you
would
do
it
would
you
like
a
bird
queen
of
my
then
that
splendid
you
better
give
archie
that
photograph
of
mabel
to
give
to
reggie
photograph
said
bill
which
photograph
i
have
archie
found
reggie
van
tuyl
brooding
in
a
window
of
his
club
that
looked
over
fifth
avenue
reggie
was
a
rather
melancholy
young
man
who
suffered
from
elephantiasis
of
the
and
the
other
evils
that
arise
from
that
complaint
gentle
and
sentimental
by
nature
his
sensibilities
had
been
much
wounded
by
contact
with
a
sordid
world
and
the
thing
that
had
first
endeared
archie
to
him
was
the
fact
that
the
latter
though
chronically
had
never
made
any
attempt
to
borrow
money
from
him
reggie
would
have
parted
with
it
on
demand
but
it
had
delighted
him
to
find
that
archie
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
his
society
without
having
any
ulterior
motives
he
was
fond
of
archie
and
also
of
lucille
and
their
happy
marriage
was
a
constant
source
of
gratification
to
him
for
reggie
was
a
sentimentalist
he
would
have
liked
to
live
in
a
world
of
ideally
united
couples
himself
ideally
united
to
some
charming
and
affectionate
girl
but
as
a
matter
of
cold
fact
he
was
a
bachelor
and
most
of
the
couples
he
knew
were
veterans
of
several
divorces
in
reggie
circle
therefore
the
of
archie
and
lucille
shone
like
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
it
inspired
him
in
moments
of
depression
it
restored
his
waning
faith
in
human
nature
consequently
when
archie
having
greeted
him
and
slipped
into
a
chair
at
his
side
suddenly
produced
from
his
inside
pocket
the
photograph
of
an
extremely
pretty
girl
and
asked
him
to
get
her
a
small
part
in
the
play
which
he
was
financing
he
was
shocked
and
disappointed
he
was
in
a
more
than
usually
sentimental
mood
that
afternoon
and
had
indeed
at
the
moment
of
archie
arrival
been
dreaming
wistfully
of
soft
arms
clasped
snugly
about
his
collar
and
the
patter
of
little
feet
and
all
that
sort
of
gazed
reproachfully
at
archie
archie
his
voice
quivered
with
emotion
is
it
worth
it
is
it
worth
it
old
man
of
the
poor
little
woman
at
home
archie
was
puzzled
eh
old
top
which
poor
little
woman
think
of
her
trust
in
you
her
faith
i
do
absolutely
get
you
old
what
would
lucille
say
if
she
knew
about
this
oh
she
does
she
knows
all
about
good
heavens
cried
was
shocked
to
the
core
of
his
of
the
articles
of
his
faith
was
that
the
union
of
lucille
and
archie
was
different
from
those
loose
partnerships
which
were
the
custom
in
his
had
not
been
conscious
of
such
a
poignant
feeling
that
the
foundations
of
the
universe
were
cracked
and
tottering
and
that
there
was
no
light
and
sweetness
in
life
since
the
morning
eighteen
months
back
when
a
negligent
valet
had
sent
him
out
into
fifth
avenue
with
only
one
spat
on
it
was
lucille
idea
explained
archie
he
was
about
to
mention
his
connection
with
the
matter
but
checked
himself
in
time
remembering
bill
specific
objection
to
having
his
secret
revealed
to
reggie
it
like
this
old
thing
i
never
met
this
female
but
she
a
pal
of
lucille
he
comforted
his
conscience
by
the
reflection
that
if
she
was
now
she
would
be
in
a
few
days
and
lucille
wants
to
do
her
a
bit
of
good
she
been
on
the
stage
in
england
you
know
supporting
a
jolly
old
widowed
mother
and
educating
a
little
brother
and
all
that
kind
and
species
of
rot
you
understand
and
now
she
coming
over
to
america
and
lucille
wants
you
to
rally
round
and
shove
her
into
your
show
and
generally
keep
the
home
fires
burning
and
so
forth
how
do
we
go
reggie
beamed
with
relief
he
felt
just
as
he
had
felt
on
that
other
occasion
at
the
moment
when
a
had
rolled
up
and
enabled
him
to
hide
his
spatless
leg
from
the
public
gaze
oh
i
see
he
said
why
delighted
old
man
quite
delighted
any
small
part
would
do
is
there
a
maid
or
something
in
your
of
refined
entertainment
who
drifts
about
saying
madam
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
well
then
that
just
the
thing
topping
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
you
old
bird
i
get
lucille
to
ship
her
round
to
your
address
when
she
arrives
i
fancy
she
due
to
totter
in
somewhere
in
the
next
few
days
well
i
must
be
popping
said
reggie
it
was
about
a
week
later
that
lucille
came
into
the
suite
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
that
was
her
home
and
found
archie
lying
on
the
couch
smoking
a
refreshing
pipe
after
the
labours
of
the
day
it
seemed
to
archie
that
his
wife
was
not
in
her
usual
cheerful
frame
of
mind
he
kissed
her
and
having
relieved
her
of
her
parasol
endeavoured
without
success
to
balance
it
on
his
chin
having
picked
it
up
from
the
floor
and
placed
it
on
the
table
he
became
aware
that
lucille
was
looking
at
him
in
a
despondent
sort
of
way
her
grey
eyes
were
clouded
halloa
old
thing
said
archie
what
up
lucille
sighed
wearily
archie
darling
do
you
know
any
really
good
well
said
archie
reflectively
let
me
see
i
did
pick
up
a
few
tolerably
ripe
and
breezy
expressions
out
in
france
all
through
my
military
career
there
was
something
about
me
some
subtle
magnetism
do
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
seemed
to
make
colonels
and
blighters
of
that
order
rather
inventive
i
sort
of
inspired
them
you
know
i
remember
one
addressing
me
for
quite
ten
minutes
saying
something
new
all
the
time
and
even
then
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
only
touched
the
fringe
of
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
straight
out
in
the
most
frank
and
confiding
way
that
mere
words
could
do
justice
to
me
but
why
because
i
want
to
relieve
my
anything
wrong
everything
wrong
i
just
been
having
tea
with
bill
and
his
oh
ah
said
archie
interested
and
what
the
verdict
guilty
said
lucille
and
the
sentence
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
would
be
transportation
for
she
peeled
off
her
gloves
irritably
what
fools
men
are
not
you
precious
you
the
only
man
in
the
world
that
is
it
seems
to
me
you
did
marry
a
nice
girl
did
you
you
did
go
running
round
after
females
with
crimson
hair
goggling
at
them
with
your
eyes
popping
out
of
your
head
like
a
bulldog
waiting
for
a
oh
i
say
does
old
bill
look
like
that
worse
archie
rose
to
a
point
of
order
but
one
moment
old
lady
you
speak
of
crimson
hair
surely
old
bill
in
the
extremely
jolly
monologues
he
used
to
deliver
whenever
i
did
see
him
coming
and
he
got
me
alone
used
to
allude
to
her
hair
as
it
is
brown
now
it
bright
scarlet
good
gracious
i
ought
to
know
i
been
looking
at
it
all
the
afternoon
it
dazzled
me
if
got
to
meet
her
again
i
mean
to
go
to
the
oculist
and
get
a
pair
of
those
smoked
glasses
you
wear
at
palm
lucille
brooded
silently
for
a
while
over
the
tragedy
i
do
want
to
say
anything
against
her
of
no
no
of
course
but
of
all
the
awful
girls
i
ever
met
she
the
worst
she
has
vermilion
hair
and
an
imitation
oxford
manner
she
so
horribly
refined
that
it
dreadful
to
listen
to
her
she
a
sly
creepy
slinky
insincere
vampire
she
common
she
awful
she
a
cat
you
quite
right
not
to
say
anything
against
her
said
archie
approvingly
it
begins
to
look
he
went
on
as
if
the
good
old
pater
was
about
due
for
another
shock
he
has
a
hard
life
if
bill
dares
to
introduce
that
girl
to
father
he
taking
his
life
in
his
but
surely
that
was
the
idea
the
scheme
the
wheeze
was
it
or
do
you
think
there
any
chance
of
his
weakening
weakening
you
should
have
seen
him
looking
at
her
it
was
like
a
small
boy
flattening
his
nose
against
the
window
of
a
bit
thick
lucille
kicked
the
leg
of
the
table
and
to
think
she
said
that
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
to
look
up
to
bill
as
a
monument
of
wisdom
i
used
to
hug
his
knees
and
gaze
into
his
face
and
wonder
how
anyone
could
be
so
she
gave
the
unoffending
table
another
kick
if
i
could
have
looked
into
the
future
she
said
with
feeling
i
have
bitten
him
in
the
ankle
in
the
days
which
followed
archie
found
himself
a
little
out
of
touch
with
bill
and
his
romance
lucille
referred
to
the
matter
only
when
he
brought
the
subject
up
and
made
it
plain
that
the
topic
of
her
future
was
not
one
which
she
enjoyed
discussing
brewster
senior
when
archie
by
way
of
delicately
preparing
his
mind
for
what
was
about
to
befall
asked
him
if
he
liked
red
hair
called
him
a
fool
and
told
him
to
go
away
and
bother
someone
else
when
they
were
busy
the
only
person
who
could
have
kept
him
thoroughly
abreast
of
the
trend
of
affairs
was
bill
himself
and
experience
had
made
archie
wary
in
the
matter
of
meeting
bill
the
position
of
confidant
to
a
young
man
in
the
early
stages
of
love
is
no
sinecure
and
it
made
archie
sleepy
even
to
think
of
having
to
talk
to
his
he
sedulously
avoided
his
relative
and
it
was
with
a
sinking
feeling
one
day
that
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
sat
in
the
cosmopolis
preparatory
to
ordering
lunch
he
perceived
bill
bearing
down
upon
him
obviously
resolved
upon
joining
his
meal
to
his
surprise
however
bill
did
not
instantly
embark
upon
his
usual
monologue
indeed
he
hardly
spoke
at
all
he
champed
a
chop
and
seemed
to
archie
to
avoid
his
eye
it
was
not
till
lunch
was
over
and
they
were
smoking
that
he
unburdened
himself
archie
he
said
hallo
old
thing
said
archie
still
there
i
thought
you
died
or
something
talk
about
our
old
pals
thomas
and
silent
sammy
you
could
beat
both
on
the
same
it
enough
to
make
me
what
is
bill
had
relapsed
into
a
sort
of
waking
dream
he
sat
frowning
sombrely
lost
to
the
world
archie
having
waited
what
seemed
to
him
a
sufficient
length
of
time
for
an
answer
to
his
question
bent
forward
and
touched
his
hand
gently
with
the
lighted
end
of
his
cigar
bill
came
to
himself
with
a
howl
what
is
said
archie
what
is
what
said
bill
now
listen
old
thing
protested
archie
life
is
short
and
time
is
flying
suppose
we
cut
out
the
you
hinted
there
was
something
on
your
mind
something
worrying
the
old
bean
and
i
waiting
to
hear
what
it
bill
fiddled
a
moment
with
his
i
in
an
awful
hole
he
said
at
last
what
the
trouble
it
about
that
darned
girl
archie
blinked
what
that
darned
girl
archie
could
scarcely
credit
his
senses
he
had
been
prepared
indeed
he
had
steeled
himself
to
hear
bill
allude
to
his
affinity
in
a
number
of
ways
but
that
darned
girl
was
not
one
of
them
companion
of
my
riper
years
he
said
let
get
this
thing
straight
when
you
say
darned
girl
do
you
by
any
possibility
allude
to
of
course
i
do
but
william
old
bird
oh
i
know
i
know
i
know
said
bill
irritably
you
surprised
to
hear
me
talk
like
that
about
her
a
trifle
yes
possibly
a
trifle
when
last
heard
from
laddie
you
must
recollect
you
were
speaking
of
the
lady
as
your
and
at
least
once
if
i
remember
rightly
you
alluded
to
her
as
your
little
a
sharp
howl
escaped
bill
do
a
strong
shudder
convulsed
his
frame
do
remind
me
of
it
there
been
a
species
of
slump
then
in
lambs
how
demanded
bill
savagely
can
a
girl
be
a
lamb
when
her
hair
bright
scarlet
dashed
difficult
admitted
archie
i
suppose
lucille
told
you
about
that
she
did
touch
on
it
lightly
as
it
were
with
a
sort
of
gossamer
touch
so
to
bill
threw
off
the
last
fragments
of
reserve
archie
i
in
the
devil
of
a
fix
i
do
know
why
it
was
but
directly
i
saw
her
things
seemed
so
different
over
in
england
i
he
swallowed
in
gulps
i
suppose
it
was
seeing
her
with
lucille
old
lu
is
such
a
thoroughbred
seemed
to
kind
of
show
her
up
like
seeing
imitation
pearls
by
the
side
of
real
pearls
and
that
crimson
hair
it
sort
of
put
the
lid
on
bill
brooded
morosely
it
ought
to
be
a
criminal
offence
for
women
to
dye
their
hair
especially
red
what
the
devil
do
women
do
that
sort
of
thing
for
do
blame
me
old
thing
it
not
my
bill
looked
furtive
and
harassed
it
makes
me
feel
such
a
cad
here
am
i
feeling
that
i
would
give
all
i
got
in
the
world
to
get
out
of
the
darned
thing
and
all
the
time
the
poor
girl
seems
to
be
getting
fonder
of
me
than
how
do
you
know
archie
surveyed
his
critically
perhaps
her
feelings
have
changed
too
very
possibly
she
may
not
like
the
colour
of
your
hair
i
do
myself
now
if
you
were
to
dye
yourself
crimson
oh
shut
up
of
course
a
man
knows
when
a
girl
fond
of
by
no
means
laddie
when
you
my
age
i
am
your
so
you
are
i
forgot
that
well
now
approaching
the
matter
from
another
angle
let
us
suppose
old
son
that
miss
the
party
of
the
second
part
stop
it
said
bill
suddenly
here
comes
reggie
eh
here
comes
reggie
van
tuyl
i
do
want
him
to
hear
us
talking
about
the
darned
archie
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
perceived
that
it
was
indeed
so
reggie
was
threading
his
way
among
the
tables
well
he
looks
pleased
with
things
anyway
said
bill
enviously
glad
somebody
he
was
right
reggie
van
tuyl
usual
mode
of
progress
through
a
restaurant
was
a
somnolent
slouch
now
he
was
positively
bounding
along
furthermore
the
usual
expression
on
reggie
face
was
a
sleepy
sadness
now
he
smiled
brightly
and
with
animation
he
curveted
towards
their
table
beaming
and
erect
his
head
up
his
gaze
level
and
his
chest
expanded
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
been
reading
the
hints
in
the
personality
that
archie
was
puzzled
something
had
plainly
happened
to
reggie
but
what
it
was
idle
to
suppose
that
somebody
had
left
him
money
for
he
had
been
left
practically
all
the
money
there
was
a
matter
of
ten
years
before
hallo
old
bean
he
said
as
the
radiating
good
will
and
bonhomie
arrived
at
the
table
and
hung
over
it

a
sun

finished
but
rally
round
and
we
watch

watching

a
small
part
he
stopped
puzzled
archie
had
uttered
a
sound
that
was
half
gasp
and
half
gurgle
but
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
extraordinary
noise
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
bill
brewster
was
leaning
forward
with
bulging
eyes
and
soaring
eyebrows

reggie
looked
at
his
watch
halloa
i
must
rush
bill
and
archie
watched
him
as
he
bounded
out
of
the
restaurant
poor
old
reggie
said
bill
with
a
fleeting
compunction
not
necessarily
said
archie
what
i
mean
to
say
is

know
one
man
peach

man

vice

the
glad
new
year
yes
no
bill
drew
a
deep
breath

bet
your
sorrowful
existence

he
said
i
like
to
do
something
to
celebrate
the
right
spirit
said
archie
absolutely
the
right
spirit
begin
by
paying
for
my
lunch
chapter
xx
rendered
restless
by
relief
bill
brewster
did
not
linger
long
at
the
shortly
after
reggie
van
tuyl
had
retired
he
got
up
and
announced
his
intention
of
going
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
to
calm
his
excited
mind
archie
dismissed
him
with
a
courteous
wave
of
the
hand
and
beckoning
to
the
sausage
chappie
who
in
his
role
of
waiter
was
hovering
near
requested
him
to
bring
the
best
cigar
the
hotel
could
supply
the
padded
seat
in
which
he
sat
was
comfortable
he
had
no
engagements
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
pleasant
could
be
passed
in
smoking
dreamily
and
watching
his
eat
the
had
filled
up
the
sausage
chappie
having
brought
archie
his
cigar
was
attending
to
a
table
close
by
at
which
a
woman
with
a
small
boy
in
a
sailor
suit
had
seated
themselves
the
woman
was
engrossed
with
the
bill
of
fare
but
the
child
attention
seemed
riveted
upon
the
sausage
chappie
he
was
drinking
him
in
with
wide
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
brooding
on
him
archie
too
was
brooding
on
the
sausage
chappie
the
latter
made
an
excellent
waiter
he
was
brisk
and
attentive
and
did
the
work
as
if
he
liked
it
but
archie
was
not
satisfied
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
the
man
was
fitted
for
higher
things
archie
was
a
grateful
soul
that
sausage
coming
at
the
end
of
a
hike
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
plastic
nature
reason
told
him
that
only
an
exceptional
man
could
have
parted
with
half
a
sausage
at
such
a
moment
and
he
could
not
feel
that
a
job
as
waiter
at
a
new
york
hotel
was
an
adequate
job
for
an
exceptional
man
of
course
the
root
of
the
trouble
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
fellow
could
not
remember
what
his
real
had
been
before
the
war
it
was
exasperating
to
reflect
as
the
other
moved
away
to
take
his
order
to
the
kitchen
that
there
for
all
one
knew
went
the
dickens
of
a
lawyer
or
doctor
or
architect
or
what
not
his
meditations
were
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
child
mummie
asked
the
child
interestedly
following
the
sausage
chappie
with
his
eyes
as
the
latter
disappeared
towards
the
kitchen
why
has
that
man
got
such
a
funny
face
hush
yes
but
why
has
he
i
do
know
the
child
faith
in
the
maternal
omniscience
seemed
to
have
received
a
shock
he
had
the
air
of
a
seeker
after
truth
who
has
been
baffled
his
eyes
roamed
the
room
discontentedly
he
got
a
funnier
face
than
that
man
there
he
said
pointing
to
archie
hush
darling
but
he
has
much
in
a
way
it
was
a
sort
of
compliment
but
archie
felt
embarrassed
he
withdrew
coyly
into
the
cushioned
recess
presently
the
sausage
chappie
returned
attended
to
the
needs
of
the
woman
and
the
child
and
came
over
to
archie
his
homely
face
was
beaming
say
i
had
a
big
night
last
night
he
said
leaning
on
the
table
yes
said
archie
party
or
something
no
i
mean
i
suddenly
began
to
remember
things
something
seems
to
have
happened
to
the
archie
sat
up
excitedly
this
was
great
news
no
really
my
dear
old
lad
this
is
absolutely
topping
this
is
yessir
first
thing
i
remembered
was
that
i
was
born
at
springfield
ohio
it
was
like
a
mist
starting
to
lift
springfield
ohio
that
was
it
it
suddenly
came
back
to
splendid
anything
else
yessir
just
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
remembered
my
name
as
archie
was
stirred
to
his
depths
why
the
thing
a
he
exclaimed
now
you
once
got
started
nothing
can
stop
you
what
is
your
name
why
it
that
funny
it
gone
again
i
have
an
idea
it
began
with
an
what
was
it
skeffington
skillington
sanderson
no
i
get
it
in
a
moment
cunningham
carrington
wilberforce
debenham
dennison
suggested
archie
no
no
no
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
barrington
montgomery
hepplethwaite
i
got
it
smith
by
jove
really
certain
of
what
the
first
name
an
anxious
expression
came
into
the
man
eyes
he
hesitated
he
lowered
his
voice
i
have
a
horrible
feeling
that
it
lancelot
good
god
said
archie
it
could
really
be
that
could
it
archie
looked
grave
he
hated
to
give
pain
but
he
felt
he
must
be
honest
it
might
he
said
people
give
their
children
all
sorts
of
rummy
names
my
second
name
tracy
and
i
have
a
pal
in
england
who
was
christened
cuthbert
de
la
hay
horace
fortunately
everyone
calls
him
the
began
to
drift
up
like
a
bank
of
fog
and
the
sausage
chappie
returned
to
his
professional
duties
when
he
came
back
he
was
beaming
again
something
else
i
remembered
he
said
removing
the
cover
married
good
lord
at
least
i
was
before
the
war
she
had
blue
eyes
and
brown
hair
and
a
pekingese
what
was
her
name
i
do
well
you
coming
on
said
archie
i
admit
that
you
still
got
a
bit
of
a
way
to
go
before
you
become
like
one
of
those
blighters
who
take
the
memory
training
courses
in
the
magazine
advertisements
i
mean
to
say
you
know
the
lads
who
meet
a
fellow
once
for
five
minutes
and
then
come
across
him
again
ten
years
later
and
grasp
him
by
the
hand
and
say
this
is
watkins
of
seattle
still
you
doing
fine
you
only
need
patience
everything
comes
to
him
who
archie
sat
up
electrified
i
say
by
jove
that
rather
good
what
everything
comes
to
him
who
waits
and
you
a
waiter
what
what
i
mean
to
say
what
mummie
said
the
child
at
the
other
table
still
speculative
do
you
think
something
trod
on
his
face
hush
perhaps
it
was
bitten
by
something
eat
your
nice
fish
darling
said
the
mother
who
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
persons
whom
it
is
impossible
to
interest
in
a
discussion
on
first
causes
archie
felt
stimulated
not
even
the
advent
of
his
who
came
in
a
few
moments
later
and
sat
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
could
depress
his
spirits
the
sausage
chappie
came
to
his
table
again
it
a
funny
thing
he
said
like
waking
up
after
you
been
asleep
everything
seems
to
be
getting
clearer
the
dog
name
was
marie
my
wife
dog
you
know
and
she
had
a
mole
on
her
the
dog
no
my
wife
little
beast
she
bit
me
in
the
leg
your
wife
no
the
dog
good
lord
said
the
sausage
chappie
archie
looked
up
and
followed
his
gaze
a
couple
of
tables
away
next
to
a
sideboard
on
which
the
management
exposed
for
view
the
cold
meats
and
puddings
and
pies
mentioned
in
volume
two
of
the
bill
of
fare
buffet
froid
a
man
and
a
girl
had
just
seated
themselves
the
man
was
stout
and
he
bulged
in
practically
every
place
in
which
a
man
can
bulge
and
his
head
was
almost
entirely
free
from
hair
the
girl
was
young
and
pretty
her
eyes
were
blue
her
hair
was
brown
she
had
a
rather
attractive
little
mole
on
the
left
side
of
her
chin
good
lord
said
the
sausage
chappie
now
what
said
archie
who
that
over
at
the
table
there
archie
through
long
attendance
at
the
cosmopolis
grill
knew
most
of
the
habitues
by
sight
that
a
man
named
gossett
james
gossett
he
a
man
you
must
have
seen
his
name
i
do
mean
him
who
the
girl
i
never
seen
her
it
my
wife
said
the
sausage
chappie
your
wife
yes
are
you
sure
of
course
i
sure
well
well
well
said
archie
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
at
the
other
table
the
girl
unconscious
of
the
drama
which
was
about
to
enter
her
life
was
engrossed
in
conversation
with
the
stout
man
and
at
this
moment
the
stout
man
leaned
forward
and
patted
her
on
the
cheek
it
was
a
paternal
pat
the
pat
which
a
genial
uncle
might
bestow
on
a
favourite
niece
but
it
did
not
strike
the
sausage
chappie
in
that
light
he
had
been
advancing
on
the
table
at
a
fairly
rapid
pace
and
now
stirred
to
his
depths
he
bounded
forward
with
a
hoarse
cry
archie
was
at
some
pains
to
explain
to
his
later
that
if
the
management
left
cold
pies
and
things
about
all
over
the
place
this
sort
of
thing
was
bound
to
happen
sooner
or
later
he
urged
that
it
was
putting
temptation
in
people
way
and
that
brewster
had
only
himself
to
blame
whatever
the
rights
of
the
case
the
buffet
froid
undoubtedly
came
in
remarkably
handy
at
this
crisis
in
the
sausage
chappie
life
he
had
almost
reached
the
sideboard
when
the
stout
man
patted
the
girl
cheek
and
to
seize
a
huckleberry
pie
was
with
him
the
work
of
a
moment
the
next
instant
the
pie
had
whizzed
past
the
head
and
burst
like
a
shell
against
the
wall
there
are
no
doubt
restaurants
where
this
sort
of
thing
would
have
excited
little
comment
but
the
cosmopolis
was
not
one
of
them
everybody
had
something
to
say
but
the
only
one
among
those
present
who
had
anything
sensible
to
say
was
the
child
in
the
sailor
suit
do
it
again
said
the
child
cordially
the
sausage
chappie
did
it
again
he
took
up
a
fruit
salad
poised
it
for
a
moment
then
decanted
it
over
gossett
bald
head
the
happy
laughter
rang
over
the
restaurant
whatever
anybody
else
might
think
of
the
affair
this
child
liked
it
and
was
prepared
to
go
on
record
to
that
effect
epic
events
have
a
stunning
quality
they
paralyse
the
faculties
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
the
world
stood
still
brewster
bubbled
inarticulately
gossett
dried
himself
sketchily
with
a
napkin
the
sausage
chappie
snorted
the
girl
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
staring
wildly
john
she
cried
even
at
this
moment
of
crisis
the
sausage
chappie
was
able
to
look
relieved
so
it
is
he
said
and
i
thought
it
was
lancelot
i
thought
you
were
dead
i
not
said
the
sausage
chappie
gossett
speaking
thickly
through
the
was
understood
to
say
that
he
regretted
this
and
then
confusion
broke
loose
again
everybody
began
to
talk
at
once
i
say
said
archie
i
say
one
moment
of
the
first
stages
of
this
interesting
episode
archie
had
been
a
paralysed
spectator
the
thing
had
numbed
him
and
then
sudden
a
thought
came
like
a
rose
flushing
his
brow
when
he
reached
the
gesticulating
group
he
was
calm
and
he
had
a
constructive
policy
to
suggest
i
say
he
said
i
got
an
idea
go
away
said
brewster
this
is
bad
enough
without
you
butting
archie
quelled
him
with
a
gesture
leave
us
he
said
we
would
be
alone
i
want
to
have
a
little
with
he
turned
to
the
who
was
gradually
emerging
from
the
rather
after
the
manner
of
a
stout
venus
rising
from
the
sea
can
you
spare
me
a
moment
of
your
valuable
time
i
have
him
arrested
do
you
do
it
laddie
listen
the
man
mad
throwing
pies
archie
attached
himself
to
his
be
calm
laddie
calm
and
reasonable
for
the
first
time
gossett
seemed
to
become
aware
that
what
he
had
been
looking
on
as
a
vague
annoyance
was
really
an
individual
who
the
devil
are
you
archie
drew
himself
up
with
dignity
i
am
this
gentleman
representative
he
replied
indicating
the
sausage
chappie
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
his
jolly
old
personal
representative
i
act
for
him
and
on
his
behalf
i
have
a
pretty
ripe
proposition
to
lay
before
you
reflect
dear
old
bean
he
proceeded
earnestly
are
you
going
to
let
this
chance
slip
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
which
will
not
occur
again
by
jove
you
ought
to
rise
up
and
embrace
this
bird
you
ought
to
clasp
the
chappie
to
your
bosom
he
has
thrown
pies
at
you
has
he
very
well
you
are
a
your
whole
fortune
is
founded
on
chappies
who
throw
pies
you
probably
scour
the
world
for
chappies
who
throw
pies
yet
when
one
comes
right
to
you
without
any
fuss
or
trouble
and
demonstrates
before
your
very
eyes
the
fact
that
he
is
without
a
peer
as
a
you
get
the
wind
up
and
talk
about
having
him
arrested
consider
there
a
bit
of
cherry
just
behind
your
left
ear
be
sensible
why
let
your
personal
feeling
stand
in
the
way
of
doing
yourself
a
bit
of
good
give
this
chappie
a
job
and
give
it
him
quick
or
we
go
elsewhere
did
you
ever
see
fatty
arbuckle
handle
pastry
with
a
surer
touch
has
charlie
chaplin
got
this
fellow
speed
and
control
absolutely
not
i
tell
you
old
friend
you
in
danger
of
throwing
away
a
good
thing
he
paused
the
sausage
chappie
beamed
i
aways
wanted
to
go
into
the
movies
he
said
i
was
an
actor
before
the
war
just
brewster
attempted
to
speak
archie
waved
him
down
how
many
times
have
i
got
to
tell
you
not
to
butt
in
he
said
severely
gossett
militant
demeanour
had
become
a
trifle
modified
during
archie
harangue
first
and
foremost
a
man
of
business
gossett
was
not
insensible
to
the
arguments
which
had
been
put
forward
he
brushed
a
slice
of
orange
from
the
back
of
his
neck
and
mused
awhile
how
do
i
know
this
fellow
would
screen
well
he
said
at
length
screen
well
cried
archie
of
course
he
screen
well
look
at
his
face
i
ask
you
the
map
i
call
your
attention
to
he
turned
apologetically
to
the
sausage
chappie
awfully
sorry
old
lad
for
dwelling
on
this
but
it
business
you
he
turned
to
gossett
did
you
ever
see
a
face
like
that
of
course
not
why
should
i
as
this
gentleman
personal
representative
let
a
face
like
that
go
to
waste
there
a
fortune
in
it
by
jove
i
give
you
two
minutes
to
think
the
thing
over
and
if
you
do
talk
business
then
i
jolly
well
take
my
man
straight
round
to
mack
sennett
or
someone
we
have
to
ask
for
jobs
we
consider
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
clear
voice
of
the
child
in
the
sailor
suit
made
itself
heard
again
mummie
yes
darling
is
the
man
with
the
funny
face
going
to
throw
any
more
pies
no
the
child
uttered
a
scream
of
disappointed
fury
i
want
the
funny
man
to
throw
some
more
pies
i
want
the
funny
man
to
throw
some
more
pies
a
look
almost
of
awe
came
into
gossett
face
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
the
public
he
had
felt
the
beating
of
the
public
pulse
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
he
said
picking
a
piece
of
banana
off
his
right
eyebrow
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
come
round
to
my
office
chapter
xxi
the
growing
boy
the
lobby
of
the
cosmopolis
hotel
was
a
favourite
of
daniel
brewster
its
proprietor
he
liked
to
wander
about
there
keeping
a
paternal
eye
on
things
rather
in
the
manner
of
the
jolly
innkeeper
hereinafter
to
be
referred
to
as
mine
host
of
the
novel
customers
who
hurrying
in
to
dinner
tripped
over
brewster
were
apt
to
mistake
him
for
the
hotel
detective
for
his
eye
was
keen
and
his
aspect
a
trifle
austere
but
nevertheless
he
was
being
as
jolly
an
innkeeper
as
he
knew
how
his
presence
in
the
lobby
supplied
a
personal
touch
to
the
cosmopolis
which
other
new
york
hotels
lacked
and
it
undeniably
made
the
girl
at
the
extraordinarily
civil
to
her
clients
which
was
all
to
the
good
most
of
the
time
brewster
stood
in
one
spot
and
just
looked
thoughtful
but
now
and
again
he
would
wander
to
the
marble
slab
behind
which
he
kept
the
and
run
his
eye
over
the
register
to
see
who
had
booked
rooms
like
a
child
examining
the
stocking
on
christmas
morning
to
ascertain
what
santa
claus
had
brought
him
as
a
rule
brewster
concluded
this
performance
by
shoving
the
book
back
across
the
marble
slab
and
resuming
his
meditations
but
one
night
a
week
or
two
after
the
sausage
chappie
sudden
restoration
to
the
normal
he
varied
this
procedure
by
starting
rather
violently
turning
purple
and
uttering
an
exclamation
which
was
manifestly
an
exclamation
of
chagrin
he
turned
abruptly
and
cannoned
into
archie
who
in
company
with
lucille
happened
to
be
crossing
the
lobby
at
the
moment
on
his
way
to
dine
in
their
suite
brewster
apologised
gruffly
then
recognising
his
victim
seemed
to
regret
having
done
so
oh
it
you
why
ca
you
look
where
you
going
he
demanded
he
had
suffered
much
from
his
frightfully
sorry
said
archie
amiably
never
thought
you
were
going
to
backwards
all
over
the
you
must
bully
archie
said
lucille
severely
attaching
herself
to
her
father
back
hair
and
giving
it
a
punitive
tug
because
he
an
angel
and
i
love
him
and
you
must
learn
to
love
him
give
you
lessons
at
a
reasonable
rate
murmured
archie
brewster
regarded
his
young
relative
with
a
lowering
eye
what
the
matter
father
darling
asked
lucille
you
seem
upset
i
am
upset
brewster
snorted
some
people
have
got
a
nerve
he
glowered
forbiddingly
at
an
inoffensive
young
man
in
a
light
overcoat
who
had
just
entered
and
the
young
man
though
his
conscience
was
quite
clear
and
brewster
an
entire
stranger
to
him
stopped
dead
blushed
and
went
out
again
to
dine
elsewhere
some
people
have
got
the
nerve
of
an
army
mule
why
what
happened
those
darned
mccalls
have
registered
here
no
bit
beyond
me
this
said
archie
insinuating
himself
into
the
conversation
deep
waters
and
what
not
who
are
the
mccalls
some
people
father
dislikes
said
lucille
and
they
chosen
his
hotel
to
stop
at
but
father
dear
you
must
mind
it
really
a
compliment
they
come
because
they
know
it
the
best
hotel
in
new
absolutely
said
archie
good
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
all
the
comforts
of
home
look
on
the
bright
side
old
bean
no
good
getting
the
wind
up
cherrio
old
companion
do
call
me
old
companion
eh
what
oh
lucille
steered
her
husband
out
of
the
danger
zone
and
they
entered
the
lift
poor
father
she
said
as
they
went
to
their
suite
it
a
shame
they
must
have
done
it
to
annoy
him
this
man
mccall
has
a
place
next
to
some
property
father
bought
in
westchester
and
he
bringing
a
against
father
about
a
bit
of
land
which
he
claims
belongs
to
him
he
might
have
had
the
tact
to
go
to
another
hotel
but
after
all
i
suppose
it
was
the
poor
little
fellow
fault
he
does
whatever
his
wife
tells
him
we
all
do
that
said
archie
the
married
man
lucille
eyed
him
fondly
is
it
a
shame
precious
that
all
husbands
have
nice
wives
like
me
when
i
think
of
you
by
jove
said
archie
fervently
i
want
to
babble
absolutely
babble
oh
i
was
telling
you
about
the
mccalls
mccall
is
one
of
those
little
meek
men
and
his
wife
one
of
those
big
bullying
women
it
was
she
who
started
all
the
trouble
with
father
father
and
mccall
were
very
fond
of
each
other
till
she
made
him
begin
the
suit
i
feel
sure
she
made
him
come
to
this
hotel
just
to
annoy
father
still
they
probably
taken
the
most
expensive
suite
in
the
place
which
is
archie
was
at
the
telephone
his
mood
was
now
one
of
quiet
peace
of
all
the
happenings
which
went
to
make
up
existence
in
new
york
he
liked
best
the
cosy
dinners
with
lucille
in
their
suite
which
owing
to
their
engagements
for
lucille
was
a
popular
girl
with
many
friends
occurred
all
too
seldom
touching
now
the
question
of
browsing
and
sluicing
he
said
i
be
getting
them
to
send
along
a
oh
good
gracious
what
the
matter
i
just
remembered
i
promised
faithfully
i
would
go
and
see
jane
murchison
and
i
clean
forgot
i
must
but
light
of
my
soul
we

her
after

to
a
theatre

her

jolly
old

for
the
nonce

early
no
i
must
go
and
see
her
now
what
a
shame
she
sure
to
make
me
stop
to
dinner
i
tell
you
what
order
something
for
me
and
if
i
not
back
in
half
an
hour
jane
murchison
said
archie
is
a
bally
yes
but
i
known
her
since
she
was
if
her
parents
had
had
any
proper
feeling
said
archie
they
would
have
drowned
her
long
before
he
unhooked
the
receiver
and
asked
despondently
to
be
connected
with
room
service
he
thought
bitterly
of
the
exigent
jane
whom
he
recollected
dimly
as
a
tall
female
with
teeth
he
half
thought
of
going
down
to
the
on
the
chance
of
finding
a
friend
there
but
the
waiter
was
on
his
way
to
the
room
he
decided
that
he
might
as
well
stay
where
he
was
the
waiter
arrived
booked
the
order
and
departed
archie
had
just
completed
his
toilet
after
a
when
a
musical
clinking
without
announced
the
advent
of
the
meal
he
opened
the
door
the
waiter
was
there
with
a
table
congested
with
things
under
covers
from
which
escaped
a
savoury
and
appetising
odour
in
spite
of
his
depression
archie
soul
perked
up
a
trifle
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
present
who
was
deriving
enjoyment
from
the
scent
of
the
meal
standing
beside
the
waiter
and
gazing
wistfully
at
the
foodstuffs
was
a
long
thin
boy
of
about
sixteen
he
was
one
of
those
boys
who
seem
all
legs
and
knuckles
he
had
pale
red
hair
sandy
eyelashes
and
a
long
neck
and
his
eyes
as
he
removed
them
from
and
raised
them
to
archie
had
a
hungry
look
he
reminded
archie
of
a
hound
that
smells
good
said
the
long
boy
he
inhaled
deeply
yes
sir
he
continued
as
one
whose
mind
is
definitely
made
up
that
smells
good
before
archie
could
reply
the
telephone
bell
rang
it
was
lucille
confirming
her
prophecy
that
the
pest
jane
would
insist
on
her
staying
to
dine
jane
said
archie
into
the
telephone
is
a
pot
of
poison
the
waiter
is
here
now
setting
out
a
rich
banquet
and
i
shall
have
to
eat
two
of
everything
by
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turning
met
the
pale
eye
of
the
long
boy
who
had
propped
himself
up
in
the
doorway
were
you
expecting
somebody
to
dinner
asked
the
boy
why
yes
old
friend
i
i
wish
yes
oh
the
waiter
left
the
long
boy
hitched
his
back
more
firmly
against
the
doorpost
and
returned
to
his
original
theme
that
surely
does
smell
good
he
basked
a
moment
in
the
aroma
yes
sir
i
tell
the
world
it
does
archie
was
not
an
abnormally
rapid
thinker
but
he
began
at
this
point
to
get
a
clearly
defined
impression
that
this
lad
if
invited
would
waive
the
formalities
and
consent
to
join
his
meal
indeed
the
idea
archie
got
was
that
if
he
were
not
invited
pretty
soon
he
would
invite
himself
yes
he
agreed
it
does
smell
bad
what
it
smells
good
said
the
boy
oh
does
it
wake
me
up
in
the
night
and
ask
me
if
it
does
poulet
en
casserole
said
archie
golly
said
the
boy
reverently
there
was
a
pause
the
situation
began
to
seem
to
archie
a
trifle
difficult
he
wanted
to
start
his
meal
but
it
began
to
appear
that
he
must
either
do
so
under
the
penetrating
gaze
of
his
new
friend
or
else
eject
the
latter
forcibly
the
boy
showed
no
signs
of
ever
wanting
to
leave
the
doorway
you
dined
i
suppose
what
said
archie
i
never
what
not
really
dine
i
mean
i
only
get
vegetables
and
nuts
and
dieting
mother
i
do
absolutely
catch
the
drift
old
bean
said
archie
the
boy
sniffed
with
eyes
as
a
wave
of
perfume
from
the
poulet
en
casserole
floated
past
him
he
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
intercept
as
much
of
it
as
possible
before
it
got
through
the
door
mother
a
he
vouchsafed
she
lectures
on
it
she
makes
pop
and
me
live
on
vegetables
and
nuts
and
archie
was
shocked
it
was
like
listening
to
a
tale
from
the
abyss
my
dear
old
chap
you
must
suffer
agonies
absolute
shooting
pains
he
had
no
hesitation
now
common
humanity
pointed
out
his
course
would
you
care
to
join
me
in
a
bite
now
would
i
the
boy
smiled
a
wan
smile
would
i
just
stop
me
on
the
street
and
ask
me
come
on
in
then
said
archie
rightly
taking
this
peculiar
phrase
for
a
formal
acceptance
and
close
the
door
the
fatted
calf
is
getting
archie
was
not
a
man
with
a
wide
among
people
with
families
and
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
seen
a
growing
boy
in
action
at
the
table
that
he
had
forgotten
what
sixteen
is
capable
of
doing
with
a
knife
and
fork
when
it
really
squares
its
elbows
takes
a
deep
breath
and
gets
going
the
spectacle
which
he
witnessed
was
consequently
at
first
a
little
unnerving
the
long
boy
idea
of
trifling
with
a
meal
appeared
to
be
to
swallow
it
whole
and
reach
out
for
more
he
ate
like
a
starving
eskimo
archie
in
the
time
he
had
spent
in
the
trenches
making
the
world
safe
for
the
to
strike
in
had
occasionally
been
quite
peckish
but
he
sat
dazed
before
this
majestic
hunger
this
was
real
eating
there
was
little
conversation
the
growing
boy
evidently
did
not
believe
in
when
he
could
use
his
mouth
for
more
practical
purposes
it
was
not
until
the
final
roll
had
been
devoured
to
its
last
crumb
that
the
guest
found
leisure
to
address
his
host
then
he
leaned
back
with
a
contented
sigh
mother
said
the
human
python
says
you
ought
to
chew
every
mouthful
times
yes
sir
times
he
sighed
again
i
have
ever
had
meal
like
all
right
was
it
what
was
it
was
it
call
me
up
on
the
and
ask
me
sir
tipped
off
these
darned
waiters
not
to
anything
but
vegetables
and
nuts
and
things
darn
it
the
mater
seems
to
have
drastic
ideas
about
the
good
old
what
i
say
she
has
pop
hates
it
as
much
as
me
but
he
scared
to
kick
mother
says
vegetables
contain
all
the
proteins
you
want
mother
says
if
you
eat
meat
your
goes
all
blooey
do
you
think
it
does
mine
seems
pretty
well
in
the
she
great
on
talking
conceded
the
boy
she
out
somewhere
giving
a
lecture
on
rational
eating
to
some
ginks
have
to
be
slipping
up
to
our
suite
before
she
gets
he
rose
sluggishly
that
is
a
bit
of
roll
under
that
napkin
is
it
he
asked
anxiously
archie
raised
the
napkin
no
nothing
of
that
oh
well
said
the
boy
resignedly
then
i
believe
i
be
going
thanks
very
much
for
the
not
a
bit
old
top
come
again
if
you
ever
trickling
round
in
this
the
long
boy
removed
himself
slowly
loath
to
leave
at
the
door
he
cast
an
affectionate
glance
back
at
the
table
some
meal
he
said
devoutly
considerable
meal
archie
lit
a
cigarette
he
felt
like
a
boy
scout
who
has
done
his
act
of
kindness
on
the
following
morning
it
chanced
that
archie
needed
a
fresh
supply
of
tobacco
it
was
his
custom
when
this
happened
to
repair
to
a
small
shop
on
sixth
avenue
which
he
had
discovered
accidentally
in
the
course
of
his
rambles
about
the
great
city
his
relations
with
jno
blake
the
proprietor
were
friendly
and
intimate
the
discovery
that
blake
was
english
and
had
indeed
until
a
few
years
back
maintained
an
establishment
only
a
dozen
doors
or
so
from
archie
london
club
had
served
as
a
bond
he
found
blake
in
a
depressed
mood
the
tobacconist
was
a
hearty
man
who
looked
like
an
english
sporting
publican
the
kind
of
man
who
wears
a
and
drives
to
the
derby
in
a
and
usually
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
on
his
mind
except
the
vagaries
of
the
weather
concerning
which
he
was
a
great
conversationalist
but
now
moodiness
had
claimed
him
for
its
own
after
a
short
and
melancholy
good
morning
he
turned
to
the
task
of
measuring
out
the
tobacco
in
silence
archie
sympathetic
nature
was
what
the
matter
laddie
he
enquired
you
would
seem
to
be
feeling
a
bit
of
an
onion
this
bright
morning
what
yes
no
i
can
see
it
with
the
naked
blake
grunted
sorrowfully
i
had
a
knock
tell
me
all
friend
of
my
blake
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
indicated
a
poster
which
hung
on
the
wall
behind
the
counter
archie
had
noticed
it
as
he
came
in
for
it
was
designed
to
attract
the
eye
it
was
printed
in
black
letters
on
a
yellow
ground
and
ran
as
follows
social
and
outing
club
grand
contest
championship
of
the
west
side
spike
champion
blake
unknown
for
a
purse
of
and
archie
examined
this
document
gravely
it
conveyed
nothing
to
him
except
what
he
had
long
suspected
that
his
friend
had
sporting
blood
as
well
as
that
kind
of
exterior
he
expressed
a
kindly
hope
that
the
other
unknown
would
bring
home
the
bacon
blake
laughed
one
of
those
hollow
mirthless
laughs
there
ai
any
blooming
unknown
he
said
bitterly
this
man
had
plainly
suffered
yesterday
yes
but
not
archie
sighed
in
the
midst
of
life
dead
he
enquired
delicately
as
good
as
replied
the
stricken
tobacconist
he
cast
aside
his
artificial
restraint
and
became
voluble
archie
was
one
of
those
sympathetic
souls
in
whom
even
strangers
readily
confided
their
most
intimate
troubles
he
was
to
those
in
travail
of
spirit
very
much
what
catnip
is
to
a
cat
it
sir
it
blooming
i
got
the
event
all
sewed
up
in
a
parcel
and
now
this
young
to
give
me
the
knock
this
lad
of
mine
sort
of
cousin
is
comes
from
london
like
you
and
me
always
ever
since
he
landed
in
this
country
a
most
amazing
knack
of
stowing
away
grub
been
a
bit
underfed
these
last
two
or
three
years
over
in
the
old
country
what
with
food
restrictions
and
all
and
took
to
the
food
over
amazing
i
backed
against
a
ruddy
orstridge
orstridge
backed
against
a
dozen
orstridges
take
on
one
after
the
other
in
the
same
ring
on
the
same
evening
and
given
a
handicap
too
was
a
jewel
that
boy
i
seen
him
polish
off
four
pounds
of
steak
and
mealy
potatoes
and
then
look
round
kind
of
wolfish
as
much
as
to
ask
when
dinner
was
going
to
begin
that
the
kind
of
a
lad
was
till
this
very
morning
would
have
this
without
turning
a
hair
as
a
relish
before
tea
i
got
a
couple
of
dollars
on
and
thought
myself
lucky
to
get
the
odds
and
now
blake
relapsed
into
a
tortured
silence
but
what
the
matter
with
the
blighter
why
ca
he
go
over
the
top
has
he
got
indigestion
indigestion
blaife
laughed
another
of
his
hollow
laughs
you
could
give
that
boy
indigestion
if
you
fed
in
on
blades
religion
more
like
what
religion
well
you
can
call
it
that
seems
last
night
instead
of
goin
and
resting
mind
at
a
like
i
told
him
to
sneaked
off
to
some
sort
of
a
lecture
down
on
eighth
avenue
said
seen
a
piece
about
it
in
the
papers
and
it
was
about
rational
eating
and
that
kind
of
attracted
sort
of
thought
might
pick
up
a
few
hints
like
did
know
what
rational
eating
was
but
it
sounded
to
as
if
it
must
be
something
to
do
with
food
and
did
want
to
miss
it
came
in
here
just
now
said
blake
dully
and
was
a
changed
lad
scared
to
death
was
said
the
way
been
goin
on
in
the
past
it
was
a
wonder
got
any
stummick
left
it
was
a
lady
that
give
the
lecture
and
this
boy
said
it
was
amazing
what
she
told
about
and
things
did
even
know
she
showed
pictures
coloured
pictures
of
what
inside
the
injudicious
eater
stummick
who
does
chew
his
food
and
it
was
like
a
battlefield
said
would
no
more
think
of
eatin
a
lot
of
pie
than
would
of
shootin
and
anyhow
eating
pie
would
be
a
quicker
death
i
reasoned
with
moffam
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
asked
was
he
goin
to
chuck
away
fame
and
wealth
just
because
a
woman
who
did
know
what
she
was
talking
about
had
shown
him
a
lot
of
faked
pictures
but
there
was
any
doin
anything
with
him
give
me
the
knock
and
it
down
the
street
to
buy
blake
moaned
two
dollars
and
more
gone
pop
not
to
talk
of
the
fifty
dollars
would
have
won
and
me
to
get
of
archie
took
his
tobacco
and
walked
pensively
back
to
the
hotel
he
was
fond
of
jno
blake
and
grieved
for
the
trouble
that
had
come
upon
him
it
was
odd
he
felt
how
things
seemed
to
link
themselves
up
together
the
woman
who
had
delivered
the
fateful
lecture
to
injudicious
eaters
could
not
be
other
than
the
mother
of
his
young
guest
of
last
night
an
uncomfortable
woman
not
content
with
starving
her
own
family
archie
stopped
in
his
tracks
a
pedestrian
walking
behind
him
charged
into
his
back
but
archie
paid
no
attention
he
had
had
one
of
those
sudden
luminous
ideas
which
help
a
man
who
does
not
do
much
thinking
as
a
rule
to
restore
his
average
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
almost
dizzy
at
the
brilliance
of
his
thoughts
then
hurried
on
napoleon
he
mused
as
he
walked
must
have
felt
rather
like
this
after
thinking
up
a
hot
one
to
spring
on
the
enemy
as
if
destiny
were
suiting
her
plans
to
his
one
of
the
first
persons
he
saw
as
he
entered
the
lobby
of
the
cosmopolis
was
the
long
boy
he
was
standing
at
the
bookstall
reading
as
much
of
a
morning
paper
as
could
be
read
free
under
the
vigilant
eyes
of
the
presiding
girl
both
he
and
she
were
observing
the
unwritten
rules
which
govern
these
affairs
to
wit
that
you
may
read
without
interference
as
much
as
can
be
read
without
touching
the
paper
if
you
touch
the
paper
you
lose
and
have
to
buy
well
well
well
said
archie
here
we
are
again
what
he
prodded
the
boy
amiably
in
the
lower
ribs
you
just
the
chap
i
was
looking
for
got
anything
on
for
the
time
being
the
boy
said
he
had
no
engagements
then
i
want
you
to
stagger
round
with
me
to
a
chappie
i
know
on
sixth
avenue
it
only
a
couple
of
blocks
away
i
think
i
can
do
you
a
bit
of
good
put
you
on
to
something
tolerably
ripe
if
you
know
what
i
mean
trickle
along
laddie
you
do
need
a
they
found
blake
brooding
over
his
troubles
in
an
empty
shop
cheer
up
old
thing
said
archie
the
relief
expedition
has
he
directed
his
companion
gaze
to
the
poster
cast
your
eye
over
that
how
does
that
strike
you
the
long
boy
scanned
the
poster
a
gleam
appeared
in
his
rather
dull
eye
well
some
people
have
all
the
luck
said
the
long
boy
feelingly
would
you
like
to
compete
what
the
boy
smiled
a
sad
smile
would
i
would
i
say
i
know
interrupted
archie
wake
you
up
in
the
night
and
ask
you
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
you
old
he
turned
to
blake
the
fellow
you
been
wanting
to
meet
the
finest
eater
east
of
the
rockies
he
fight
the
good
fight
for
blake
english
training
had
not
been
wholly
overcome
by
residence
in
new
york
he
still
retained
a
nice
eye
for
the
distinctions
of
class
but
this
is
young
gentleman
a
young
gentleman
he
urged
doubtfully
yet
with
hope
shining
in
his
eye
he
would
do
of
course
he
would
do
be
ridic
old
would
do
what
asked
the
boy
why
save
the
old
homestead
by
taking
on
the

sad
case
between
ourselves
this
poor
egg
nominee
has
given
him
the
raspberry
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
only
you
can
save
him
and
you
owe
it
to
him
to
do
something
you
know
because
it
was
your
jolly
old
mater
lecture
last
night
that
made
the
nominee

you
must
charge
in
and
take
his
place
sort
of
poetic
justice
do
you
know
and
what
not
he
turned
to
blake
when
is
the
conflict
supposed
to
start
you
have
any
important
engagement
for
have
you
no

lunching
at
some

and
giving

patted
his
head
then
leg
it
where
glory
waits
you
old
bean
the
long
boy
was
gazing
earnestly
at
the
poster
it
seemed
to
fascinate
him
pie
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
the
word
was
like
a
chapter
xxii
washy
steps
into
the
hall
of
fame
at
about
nine
next
morning
in
a
suite
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
cora
bates
mccall
the
eminent
lecturer
on
rational
eating
was
seated
at
breakfast
with
her
family
before
her
sat
mccall
a
little
man
the
natural
peculiarities
of
whose
face
were
accentuated
by
a
pair
of
glasses
of
semicircular
shape
like
with
the
horns
turned
up
behind
these
mccall
eyes
played
a
perpetual
game
of
peekaboo
now
peering
over
them
anon
ducking
down
and
hiding
behind
them
he
was
sipping
a
cup
of
on
his
right
toying
listlessly
with
a
plateful
of
cereal
sat
his
son
washington
mccall
herself
was
eating
a
slice
of
health
bread
and
nut
butter
for
she
practised
as
well
as
preached
the
doctrines
which
she
had
striven
for
so
many
years
to
inculcate
in
an
unthinking
populace
her
day
always
began
with
a
light
but
nutritious
breakfast
at
which
a
peculiarly
uninviting
cereal
which
looked
and
tasted
like
an
old
straw
hat
that
had
been
run
through
a
meat
chopper
competed
for
first
place
in
the
dislike
of
her
husband
and
son
with
a
more
than
usually
offensive
brand
of
imitation
coffee
mccall
was
inclined
to
think
that
he
loathed
the
imitation
coffee
rather
more
than
the
cereal
but
washington
held
strong
views
on
the
latter
superior
ghastliness
both
washington
and
his
father
however
would
have
been
enough
to
admit
that
it
was
a
close
thing
mccall
regarded
her
offspring
with
grave
approval
i
am
glad
to
see
lindsay
she
said
to
her
husband
whose
eyes
sprang
dutifully
over
the
glass
fence
as
he
heard
his
name
that
washy
has
recovered
his
appetite
when
he
refused
his
dinner
last
night
i
was
afraid
that
he
might
be
sickening
for
something
especially
as
he
had
quite
a
flushed
look
you
noticed
his
flushed
look
he
did
look
very
flushed
and
his
breathing
was
almost
stertorous
and
when
he
said
that
he
had
no
appetite
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
was
anxious
but
he
is
evidently
perfectly
well
this
morning
you
do
feel
perfectly
well
this
morning
washy
the
heir
of
the
mccall
looked
up
from
his
cereal
he
was
a
long
thin
boy
of
about
sixteen
with
pale
red
hair
sandy
eyelashes
and
a
long
neck
he
said
mccall
nodded
surely
now
you
will
agree
lindsay
that
a
careful
and
rational
diet
is
what
a
boy
needs
washy
constitution
is
superb
he
has
a
remarkable
stamina
and
i
attribute
it
entirely
to
my
careful
supervision
of
his
food
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
the
growing
boys
who
are
permitted
by
irresponsible
people
to
devour
meat
candy
pie
she
broke
off
what
is
the
matter
washy
it
seemed
that
the
habit
of
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
pie
ran
in
the
mccall
family
for
at
the
mention
of
the
word
a
kind
of
internal
shimmy
had
convulsed
washington
lean
frame
and
over
his
face
there
had
come
an
expression
that
was
almost
one
of
pain
he
had
been
reaching
out
his
hand
for
a
slice
of
health
bread
but
now
he
withdrew
it
rather
hurriedly
and
sat
back
breathing
hard
i
all
right
he
said
huskily
pie
proceeded
mccall
in
her
platform
voice
she
stopped
again
abruptly
whatever
is
the
matter
washington
you
are
making
me
feel
i
all
mccall
had
lost
the
thread
of
her
remarks
moreover
having
now
finished
her
breakfast
she
was
inclined
for
a
little
light
reading
one
of
the
subjects
allied
to
the
matter
of
dietary
on
which
she
felt
deeply
was
the
question
of
reading
at
meals
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
strain
on
the
eye
coinciding
with
the
strain
on
the
digestion
could
not
fail
to
give
the
latter
the
short
end
of
the
contest
and
it
was
a
rule
at
her
table
that
the
morning
paper
should
not
even
be
glanced
at
till
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
she
said
that
it
was
upsetting
to
begin
the
day
by
reading
the
paper
and
events
were
to
prove
that
she
was
occasionally
right
all
through
breakfast
the
new
york
chronicle
had
been
lying
neatly
folded
beside
her
plate
she
now
opened
it
and
with
a
remark
about
looking
for
the
report
of
her
yesterday
lecture
at
the
butterfly
club
directed
her
gaze
at
the
front
page
on
which
she
hoped
that
an
editor
with
the
best
interests
of
the
public
at
heart
had
decided
to
place
her
mccall
jumping
up
and
down
behind
his
glasses
scrutinised
her
face
closely
as
she
began
to
read
he
always
did
this
on
these
occasions
for
none
knew
better
than
he
that
his
comfort
for
the
day
depended
largely
on
some
unknown
reporter
whom
he
had
never
met
if
this
unseen
individual
had
done
his
work
properly
and
as
befitted
the
importance
of
his
subject
mccall
mood
for
the
next
twelve
hours
would
be
as
uniformly
sunny
as
it
was
possible
for
it
to
be
but
sometimes
the
fellows
scamped
their
job
disgracefully
and
once
on
a
day
which
lived
in
mccall
memory
they
had
failed
to
make
a
report
at
all
he
noted
with
relief
all
seemed
to
be
well
the
report
actually
was
on
the
front
page
an
honour
rarely
accorded
to
his
utterances
moreover
judging
from
the
time
it
took
her
to
read
the
thing
she
had
evidently
been
reported
at
length
good
my
dear
he
ventured
satisfactory
eh
mccall
smiled
meditatively
oh
yes
excellent
they
have
used
my
photograph
too
not
at
all
badly
splendid
said
mccall
mccall
gave
a
sharp
shriek
and
the
paper
fluttered
from
her
hand
my
dear
said
mccall
with
concern
his
wife
had
recovered
the
paper
and
was
reading
with
burning
eyes
a
bright
wave
of
colour
had
flowed
over
her
masterful
features
she
was
breathing
as
stertorously
as
ever
her
son
washington
had
done
on
the
previous
night
washington
a
basilisk
glare
shot
across
the
table
and
turned
the
long
boy
to
stone
all
except
his
mouth
which
opened
feebly
washington
is
this
true
washy
closed
his
mouth
then
let
it
slowly
open
again
my
dear
mccall
voice
was
alarmed
what
is
it
his
eyes
had
climbed
up
over
his
glasses
and
remained
there
what
is
the
matter
is
anything
wrong
wrong
read
for
yourself
mccall
was
completely
mystified
he
could
not
even
formulate
a
guess
at
the
cause
of
the
trouble
that
it
appeared
to
concern
his
son
washington
seemed
to
be
the
one
solid
fact
at
his
disposal
and
that
only
made
the
matter
still
more
puzzling
where
mccall
asked
himself
did
washington
come
in
he
looked
at
the
paper
and
received
immediate
enlightenment
headlines
met
his
eyes
good
stuff
in
this
boy
about
a
ton
of
it
son
of
cora
bates
mccall
famous
lecturer
wins
championship
of
west
side
there
followed
a
lyrical
outburst
so
uplifted
had
the
reporter
evidently
felt
by
the
importance
of
his
news
that
he
had
been
unable
to
confine
himself
to
prose
my
children
if
you
fail
to
shine
or
triumph
in
your
special
line
if
let
us
say
your
hopes
are
bent
on
some
day
being
president
and
folks
ignore
your
proper
worth
and
say
you
not
a
chance
on
earth
cheer
up
for
in
these
stirring
days
fame
may
be
won
in
many
ways
consider
when
your
spirits
fall
the
case
of
washington
mccall
yes
cast
your
eye
on
washy
please
he
looks
just
like
a
piece
of
cheese
he
not
a
brilliant
sort
of
chap
he
has
a
dull
and
vacant
map
his
eyes
are
blank
his
face
is
red
his
ears
stick
out
beside
his
head
in
fact
to
end
these
compliments
he
would
be
dear
at
thirty
cents
yet
fame
has
welcomed
to
her
hall
this
washington
mccall
his
mother
nee
miss
cora
bates
is
one
who
frequently
orates
upon
the
proper
kind
of
food
which
every
menu
should
include
with
eloquence
the
world
she
weans
from
chops
and
steaks
and
pork
and
beans
such
horrid
things
she
like
to
crush
and
make
us
live
on
milk
and
mush
but
oh
the
thing
that
makes
her
sigh
is
when
she
sees
us
eating
pie
we
heard
her
lecture
last
july
upon
the
nation
menace
alas
the
hit
it
made
was
small
with
master
washington
mccall
for
yesterday
we
took
a
trip
to
see
the
great
pie
championship
where
men
with
bulging
cheeks
and
eyes
consume
vast
quantities
of
pies
a
fashionable
west
side
crowd
beheld
the
champion
spike
endeavour
to
defend
his
throne
against
an
upstart
blake
unknown
he
was
an
unknown
at
all
he
was
young
washington
mccall
we
freely
own
we
give
a
leg
if
we
could
borrow
steal
or
beg
the
skill
old
homer
used
to
show
he
wrote
the
iliad
you
know
old
homer
swung
a
wicked
pen
but
we
are
ordinary
men
and
can
not
even
start
to
dream
of
doing
justice
to
our
theme
the
subject
of
that
great
repast
is
too
magnificent
and
vast
we
ca
describe
or
even
try
the
way
those
rivals
wolfed
their
pie
enough
to
say
that
when
for
hours
each
had
extended
all
his
toward
the
quiet
evenfall
succumbed
to
young
mccall
the
champion
was
a
willing
lad
he
gave
the
public
all
he
had
his
was
a
genuine
fighting
soul
he
lots
of
speed
and
much
control
no
yellow
streak
did
he
evince
he
tackled
and
mince
this
was
the
motto
on
his
shield
may
burst
they
never
his
eyes
began
to
start
and
roll
he
eased
his
belt
another
hole
poor
fellow
with
a
single
glance
one
saw
that
he
had
not
a
chance
a
python
would
have
had
to
crawl
and
own
defeat
from
young
mccall
at
last
long
last
the
finish
came
his
features
overcast
with
shame
who
faltered
once
or
twice
declined
to
eat
another
slice
he
tottered
off
and
kindly
men
rallied
around
with
oxygen
but
washy
cora
bates
son
seemed
disappointed
it
was
done
he
somehow
made
those
present
feel
he
barely
started
on
his
meal
we
ask
him
are
you
feeling
bad
me
said
the
lad
lead
me
he
started
for
the
street
where
i
can
get
a
bite
to
eat
oh
what
a
lesson
does
it
teach
to
all
of
us
that
splendid
speech
how
better
can
the
curtain
fall
on
master
washington
mccall
mccall
read
this
epic
through
then
he
looked
at
his
son
he
first
looked
at
him
over
his
glasses
then
through
his
glasses
then
over
his
glasses
again
then
through
his
glasses
once
more
a
curious
expression
was
in
his
eyes
if
such
a
thing
had
not
been
so
impossible
one
would
have
said
that
his
gaze
had
in
it
something
of
respect
of
admiration
even
of
reverence
but
how
did
they
find
out
your
name
he
asked
at
length
mccall
exclaimed
impatiently
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
no
no
my
dear
of
course
not
quite
so
but
the
point
struck
me
as
wretched
boy
cried
mccall
were
you
insane
enough
to
reveal
your
name
washington
wriggled
uneasily
unable
to
endure
the
piercing
stare
of
his
mother
he
had
withdrawn
to
the
window
and
was
looking
out
with
his
back
turned
but
even
there
he
could
feel
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
his
neck
i
did
think
it
matter
he
mumbled
a
fellow
with
specs
asked
me
so
i
told
him
how
was
i
to
know
his
stumbling
defence
was
cut
short
by
the
opening
of
the
door
what
ho
what
ho
archie
was
standing
in
the
doorway
beaming
ingratiatingly
on
the
family
the
apparition
of
an
entire
stranger
served
to
divert
the
lightning
of
mccall
gaze
from
the
unfortunate
washy
archie
catching
it
between
the
eyes
blinked
and
held
on
to
the
wall
he
had
begun
to
regret
that
he
had
yielded
so
weakly
to
lucille
entreaty
that
he
should
look
in
on
the
mccalls
and
use
the
magnetism
of
his
personality
upon
them
in
the
hope
of
inducing
them
to
settle
the
lawsuit
he
wished
too
if
the
visit
had
to
be
paid
that
he
had
postponed
it
till
after
lunch
for
he
was
never
at
his
strongest
in
the
morning
but
lucille
had
urged
him
to
go
now
and
get
it
over
and
here
he
was
i
think
said
mccall
icily
that
you
must
have
mistaken
your
archie
rallied
his
shaken
forces
oh
no
rather
not
better
introduce
myself
what
my
name
moffam
you
know
i
old
brewster
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
if
you
know
what
i
he
gulped
and
continued
i
come
about
this
jolly
old
lawsuit
do
you
mccall
seemed
about
to
speak
but
his
wife
anticipated
him
mr
brewster
attorneys
are
in
communication
with
ours
we
do
not
wish
to
discuss
the
archie
took
an
uninvited
seat
eyed
the
health
bread
on
the
breakfast
table
for
a
moment
with
frank
curiosity
and
resumed
his
discourse
no
but
i
say
you
know
i
tell
you
what
happened
i
hate
to
totter
in
where
i
not
wanted
and
all
that
but
my
wife
made
such
a
point
of
it
rightly
or
wrongly
she
regards
me
as
a
bit
of
a
hound
in
the
diplomacy
line
and
she
begged
me
to
look
you
up
and
see
whether
we
could
do
something
about
settling
the
jolly
old
thing
i
mean
to
say
you
know
the
old
bird
old
brewster
you
know
is
considerably
perturbed
about
the
affair
hates
the
thought
of
being
in
a
posish
where
he
has
either
got
to
bite
his
old
pal
mccall
in
the
neck
or
be
bitten
by
him
and
well
and
so
forth
do
you
know
how
about
it
he
broke
off
great
scot
i
say
what
so
engrossed
had
he
been
in
his
appeal
that
he
had
not
observed
the
presence
of
the
champion
between
whom
and
himself
a
large
potted
plant
intervened
but
now
washington
hearing
the
familiar
voice
had
moved
from
the
window
and
was
confronting
him
with
an
accusing
stare
he
made
me
do
it
said
washy
with
the
stern
joy
a
boy
feels
when
he
sees
somebody
on
to
whose
shoulders
he
can
shift
trouble
from
his
own
that
the
fellow
who
took
me
to
the
place
what
are
you
talking
about
washington
i
telling
you
he
got
me
into
the
do
you
mean
this
this
mccall
shuddered
are
you
referring
to
this
contest
you
bet
i
am
is
this
true
mccall
glared
stonily
at
archie
was
it
you
who
lured
my
poor
boy
into
that
that
oh
absolutely
the
fact
is
do
you
know
a
dear
old
pal
of
mine
who
runs
a
tobacco
shop
on
sixth
avenue
was
rather
in
the
soup
he
had
backed
a
chappie
against
the
champion
and
the
chappie
was
converted
by
one
of
your
lectures
and
swore
off
pie
at
the
eleventh
hour
dashed
hard
luck
on
the
poor
chap
do
you
know
and
then
i
got
the
idea
that
our
little
friend
here
was
the
one
to
step
in
and
save
the
situash
so
i
broached
the
matter
to
him
and
i
tell
you
one
thing
said
archie
handsomely
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
capacity
the
original
chappie
had
but
i
bet
he
was
in
your
son
class
your
son
has
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
absolutely
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
him
he
turned
in
friendly
fashion
to
washy
rummy
we
should
meet
again
like
this
never
dreamed
i
should
find
you
here
and
by
jove
it
absolutely
marvellous
how
fit
you
look
after
yesterday
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
you
would
be
groaning
on
a
bed
of
sickness
and
all
there
was
a
strange
gurgling
sound
in
the
background
it
resembled
something
getting
up
steam
and
this
curiously
enough
is
precisely
what
it
was
the
thing
that
was
getting
up
steam
was
lindsay
mccall
the
first
effect
of
the
washy
revelations
on
mccall
had
been
merely
to
stun
him
it
was
not
until
the
arrival
of
archie
that
he
had
had
leisure
to
think
but
since
archie
entrance
he
had
been
thinking
rapidly
and
deeply
for
many
years
mccall
had
been
in
a
state
of
suppressed
revolution
he
had
smouldered
but
had
not
dared
to
blaze
but
this
startling
upheaval
of
his
washy
had
acted
upon
him
like
a
high
explosive
there
was
a
strange
gleam
in
his
eye
a
gleam
of
determination
he
was
breathing
hard
washy
his
voice
had
lost
its
deprecating
mildness
it
rang
strong
and
clear
yes
pop
how
many
pies
did
you
eat
yesterday
washy
considered
a
good
how
many
twenty
more
than
that
i
lost
count
a
good
and
you
feel
as
well
as
ever
i
feel
mccall
dropped
his
glasses
he
glowered
for
a
moment
at
the
breakfast
table
his
eye
took
in
the
health
bread
the
imitation
the
cereal
the
then
with
a
swift
movement
he
seized
the
cloth
jerked
it
forcibly
and
brought
the
entire
contents
rattling
and
crashing
to
the
floor
lindsay
mccall
met
his
wife
eye
with
quiet
determination
it
was
plain
that
something
had
happened
in
the
hinterland
of
mccall
soul
cora
he
said
resolutely
i
have
come
to
a
decision
i
been
letting
you
run
things
your
own
way
a
little
too
long
in
this
family
i
going
to
assert
myself
for
one
thing
i
had
all
i
want
of
this
foolery
look
at
washy
yesterday
that
boy
seems
to
have
consumed
anything
from
a
couple
of
hundredweight
to
a
ton
of
pie
and
he
has
thriven
on
it
thriven
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
cora
but
washington
and
i
have
drunk
our
last
cup
of
if
you
care
to
go
on
with
the
stuff
that
your
but
washy
and
i
are
he
silenced
his
wife
with
a
masterful
gesture
and
turned
to
archie
and
there
another
thing
i
never
liked
the
idea
of
that
lawsuit
but
i
let
you
talk
me
into
it
now
i
going
to
do
things
my
way
moffam
glad
you
looked
in
this
morning
i
do
just
what
you
want
take
me
to
dan
brewster
now
and
let
call
the
thing
off
and
shake
hands
on
are
you
mad
lindsay
it
was
cora
bates
mccall
last
shot
mccall
paid
no
attention
to
it
he
was
shaking
hands
with
archie
i
consider
you
moffam
he
said
the
most
sensible
young
man
i
have
ever
met
archie
blushed
modestly
awfully
good
of
you
old
bean
he
said
i
wonder
if
you
mind
telling
my
jolly
old
that
it
be
a
bit
of
news
for
him
chapter
xxiii
mother
knee
archie
moffam
connection
with
that
devastatingly
popular
ballad
mother
knee
was
one
to
which
he
always
looked
back
later
with
a
certain
pride
mother
knee
it
will
be
remembered
went
through
the
world
like
a
pestilence
scots
elders
hummed
it
on
their
way
to
kirk
cannibals
crooned
it
to
their
offspring
in
the
jungles
of
borneo
it
was
a
among
the
bolshevists
in
the
united
states
alone
three
million
copies
were
disposed
of
for
a
man
who
has
not
accomplished
anything
outstandingly
great
in
his
life
it
is
something
to
have
been
in
a
sense
responsible
for
a
song
like
that
and
though
there
were
moments
when
archie
experienced
some
of
the
emotions
of
a
man
who
has
punched
a
hole
in
the
dam
of
one
of
the
larger
reservoirs
he
never
really
regretted
his
share
in
the
launching
of
the
thing
it
seems
almost
bizarre
now
to
think
that
there
was
a
time
when
even
one
person
in
the
world
had
not
heard
mother
knee
but
it
came
fresh
to
archie
one
afternoon
some
weeks
after
the
episode
of
washy
in
his
suite
at
the
hotel
cosmopolis
where
he
was
cementing
with
cigarettes
and
pleasant
conversation
his
renewed
friendship
with
wilson
hymack
whom
he
had
first
met
in
the
neighbourhood
of
armentieres
during
the
war
what
are
you
doing
these
days
enquired
wilson
hymack
me
said
archie
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
what
you
might
call
a
sort
of
species
of
lull
in
my
activities
at
the
moment
but
my
jolly
old
is
bustling
about
running
up
a
new
hotel
a
bit
farther
and
the
scheme
is
for
me
to
be
manager
when
finished
from
what
i
have
seen
in
this
place
it
a
simple
sort
of
job
and
i
fancy
i
shall
be
somewhat
hot
stuff
how
are
you
filling
in
the
long
hours
i
in
my
uncle
office
darn
it
starting
at
the
bottom
and
learning
the
business
and
all
that
a
noble
pursuit
no
doubt
but
i
bound
to
say
it
would
give
me
the
pip
in
no
uncertain
it
gives
me
said
wilson
hymack
a
pain
in
the
thorax
i
want
to
be
a
a
composer
eh
archie
felt
that
he
should
have
guessed
this
the
chappie
had
a
distinctly
artistic
look
he
wore
a
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
his
trousers
bagged
at
the
knees
and
his
hair
which
during
the
martial
epoch
of
his
career
had
been
pruned
to
the
roots
fell
about
his
ears
in
luxuriant
disarray
say
do
you
want
to
hear
the
best
thing
i
ever
done
indubitably
said
archie
politely
carry
on
old
bird
i
wrote
the
lyric
as
well
as
the
melody
said
wilson
hymack
who
had
already
seated
himself
at
the
piano
it
got
the
greatest
title
you
ever
heard
it
a
lallapaloosa
it
called
a
long
way
back
to
mother
knee
how
that
poor
eh
archie
expelled
a
doubtfully
is
it
a
little
stale
stale
what
do
you
mean
stale
there
always
room
for
another
song
boosting
oh
is
it
boosting
mother
archie
face
cleared
i
thought
it
was
a
hit
at
the
short
skirts
why
of
course
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
that
case
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
ripe
fruity
and
pretty
well
all
to
the
mustard
let
have
wilson
hymack
pushed
as
much
of
his
hair
out
of
his
eyes
as
he
could
reach
with
one
hand
cleared
his
throat
looked
dreamily
over
the
top
of
the
piano
at
a
photograph
of
archie
daniel
brewster
played
a
prelude
and
began
to
sing
in
a
weak
high
composer
voice
all
composers
sing
exactly
alike
and
they
have
to
be
heard
to
be
believed
one
night
a
young
man
wandered
through
the
glitter
of
broadway
his
money
he
had
squandered
for
a
meal
he
could
tough
luck
murmured
archie
sympathetically
he
thought
about
the
village
where
his
boyhood
he
had
spent
and
yearned
for
all
the
simple
joys
with
which
he
been
the
right
spirit
said
archie
with
approval
i
beginning
to
like
this
chappie
do
interrupt
oh
carried
away
and
all
that
he
looked
upon
the
city
so
frivolous
and
gay
and
as
he
heaved
a
weary
sigh
these
words
he
then
did
say
it
a
long
way
back
to
mother
knee
mother
knee
mother
knee
it
a
long
way
back
to
mother
knee
where
i
used
to
stand
and
prattle
with
my
and
rattle
oh
those
childhood
days
in
tennessee
they
sure
look
good
to
me
it
a
long
long
way
but
i
gon
na
start
i
going
back
believe
me
oh
i
going
back
i
want
to
go
i
going
back
back
on
the
to
the
dear
old
shack
where
i
used
to
be
i
going
back
to
mother
knee
wilson
hymack
voice
cracked
on
the
final
high
note
which
was
of
an
altitude
beyond
his
powers
he
turned
with
a
modest
cough
that
give
you
an
idea
of
it
it
has
old
thing
it
has
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
ball
of
fire
it
has
many
of
the
earmarks
of
a
sound
egg
admitted
archie
of
course
of
course
it
wants
just
what
i
was
going
to
it
wants
a
woman
to
sing
it
a
woman
who
could
reach
out
for
that
last
high
note
and
teach
it
to
take
a
joke
the
whole
refrain
is
working
up
to
that
you
need
tetrazzini
or
someone
who
would
just
pick
that
note
off
the
roof
and
hold
it
till
the
janitor
came
round
to
lock
up
the
building
for
the
i
must
buy
a
copy
for
my
wife
where
can
i
get
it
you
ca
get
it
it
is
published
writing
music
the
darndest
job
wilson
hymack
snorted
fiercely
it
was
plain
that
the
man
was
pouring
out
the
emotion
of
many
days
you
write
the
biggest
thing
in
years
and
you
go
round
trying
to
get
someone
to
sing
it
and
they
say
you
a
genius
and
then
shove
the
song
away
in
a
drawer
and
forget
about
archie
lit
another
cigarette
i
a
jolly
old
child
in
these
matters
old
lad
he
said
but
why
do
you
take
it
direct
to
a
publisher
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
it
would
be
any
use
to
you
i
was
foregathering
with
a
only
the
other
day
a
bird
of
the
name
of
blumenthal
he
was
lunching
in
here
with
a
pal
of
mine
and
we
got
tolerably
matey
why
not
let
me
tool
you
round
to
the
office
and
play
it
to
him
no
thanks
much
obliged
but
i
not
going
to
play
that
melody
in
any
publisher
office
with
his
hired
gang
of
alley
composers
listening
at
the
keyhole
and
taking
notes
i
have
to
wait
till
i
can
find
somebody
to
sing
it
well
i
must
be
going
along
glad
to
have
seen
you
again
sooner
or
later
i
take
you
to
hear
that
high
note
sung
by
someone
in
a
way
that
make
your
spine
tie
itself
in
knots
round
the
back
of
your
i
count
the
days
said
archie
courteously
hardly
had
the
door
closed
behind
the
composer
when
it
opened
again
to
admit
lucille
hallo
light
of
my
soul
said
archie
rising
and
embracing
his
wife
where
have
you
been
all
the
afternoon
i
was
expecting
you
this
many
an
hour
past
i
wanted
you
to
meet
i
been
having
tea
with
a
girl
down
in
greenwich
village
i
get
away
before
who
was
that
who
went
out
just
as
i
came
along
the
passage
chappie
of
the
name
of
hymack
i
met
him
in
france
a
composer
and
what
we
seem
to
have
been
moving
in
artistic
circles
this
afternoon
the
girl
i
went
to
see
is
a
singer
at
least
she
wants
to
sing
but
gets
no
precisely
the
same
with
my
bird
he
wants
to
get
his
music
sung
but
nobody
sing
it
but
i
did
know
you
knew
any
greenwich
village
warblers
sunshine
of
my
home
how
did
you
meet
this
female
lucille
sat
down
and
gazed
forlornly
at
him
with
her
big
grey
eyes
she
was
registering
something
but
archie
could
not
gather
what
it
was
archie
darling
when
you
married
me
you
undertook
to
share
my
sorrows
did
you
absolutely
it
all
in
the
book
of
words
for
better
or
for
worse
in
sickness
and
in
health
regular
contract
then
share
said
lucille
bill
in
love
again
archie
blinked
bill
when
you
say
bill
do
you
mean
bill
your
brother
bill
my
bill
jolly
old
william
the
son
and
heir
of
the
brewsters
i
you
say
he
in
love
cupid
dart
even
so
but
i
say
is
this
rather
what
i
mean
to
say
is
the
lad
an
absolute
scourge
the
great
lover
what
also
ran
brigham
young
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
why
it
only
a
few
weeks
ago
that
he
was
moaning
brokenly
about
that
female
who
subsequently
hooked
on
to
old
reggie
van
tuyl
she
a
little
better
than
that
girl
thank
goodness
all
the
same
i
do
think
father
will
of
what
calibre
is
the
latest
exhibit
well
she
comes
from
the
middle
west
and
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
twice
as
bohemian
as
the
rest
of
the
girls
down
in
greenwich
village
she
wears
her
hair
bobbed
and
goes
about
in
a
kimono
she
probably
read
magazine
stories
about
greenwich
village
and
has
modelled
herself
on
them
it
so
silly
when
you
can
see
hicks
corners
sticking
out
of
her
all
the
that
one
got
past
me
before
i
could
grab
it
what
did
you
say
she
had
sticking
out
of
her
i
meant
that
anybody
could
see
that
she
came
from
somewhere
out
in
the
wilds
as
a
matter
of
fact
bill
tells
me
that
she
was
brought
up
in
snake
bite
snake
bite
what
rummy
names
you
have
in
america
still
i
admit
there
a
village
in
england
called
nether
wallop
so
who
am
i
to
cast
the
first
stone
how
is
old
bill
pretty
feverish
he
says
this
time
it
is
the
real
that
what
they
all
say
i
wish
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
time
forgotten
what
i
was
going
to
say
broke
off
archie
prudently
so
you
think
he
went
on
after
a
pause
that
william
latest
is
going
to
be
one
more
shock
for
the
old
dad
i
ca
imagine
father
approving
of
i
studied
your
merry
old
progenitor
pretty
closely
said
archie
and
between
you
and
me
i
ca
imagine
him
approving
of
anybody
i
ca
understand
why
it
is
that
bill
goes
out
of
his
way
to
pick
these
horrors
i
know
at
least
twenty
delightful
girls
all
pretty
and
with
lots
of
money
who
would
be
just
the
thing
for
him
but
he
sneaks
away
and
goes
falling
in
love
with
someone
impossible
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
one
always
feels
one
got
to
do
one
best
to
see
him
absolutely
one
does
want
to
throw
a
spanner
into
the
works
of
love
young
dream
it
behoves
us
to
rally
round
have
you
heard
this
girl
sing
yes
she
sang
this
what
sort
of
a
voice
has
she
got
well
it
loud
could
she
pick
a
high
note
off
the
roof
and
hold
it
till
the
janitor
came
round
to
lock
up
the
building
for
the
night
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
answer
me
this
woman
frankly
how
is
her
high
note
pretty
lofty
why
then
say
no
more
said
archie
leave
this
to
me
my
dear
old
better
hand
the
whole
thing
over
to
archibald
the
man
who
never
lets
you
down
i
have
a
scheme
as
archie
approached
his
suite
on
the
following
afternoon
he
heard
through
the
closed
door
the
drone
of
a
gruff
male
voice
and
going
in
discovered
lucille
in
the
company
of
his
lucille
archie
thought
was
looking
a
trifle
fatigued
bill
on
the
other
hand
was
in
great
shape
his
eyes
were
shining
and
his
face
looked
so
like
that
of
a
stuffed
frog
that
archie
had
no
difficulty
in
gathering
that
he
had
been
lecturing
on
the
subject
of
his
latest
enslaver
hallo
bill
old
crumpet
he
said
hallo
archie
i
so
glad
you
come
said
lucille
bill
is
telling
me
all
about
who
spectatia
the
girl
you
know
her
name
is
spectatia
it
ca
be
said
archie
incredulously
why
not
growled
bill
well
how
could
it
said
archie
appealing
to
him
as
a
reasonable
man
i
mean
to
say
spectatia
huskisson
i
gravely
doubt
whether
there
is
such
a
what
wrong
with
it
demanded
the
incensed
bill
it
a
darned
sight
better
name
than
archibald
do
fight
you
two
children

it
a
good
old
middle
west
name

knows

huskissons
of
snake

besides
bill
calls
her
pootles
corrected
bill
austerely
oh
yes
pootles
he
calls
her
young
blood
young
blood
sighed
archie
i
wish
you
would
talk
as
if
you
were
my
i
look
on
you
as
a
son
laddie
a
favourite
son
if
i
had
a
father
like
you
ah
but
you
have
and
that
the
trouble
if
you
had
everything
would
be
simple
but
as
your
actual
father
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
is
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
the
human
in
captivity
something
has
got
to
be
done
about
it
and
you
dashed
lucky
to
have
me
in
your
corner
a
guide
philosopher
and
friend
full
of
the
fruitiest
ideas
now
if
you
kindly
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
i
been
listening
to
you
ever
since
you
came
you
would
speak
in
that
harsh
tone
of
voice
if
you
knew
all
william
i
have
a
scheme
well
the
scheme
to
which
i
allude
is
what
maeterlinck
would
call
a
lallapaloosa
what
a
little
marvel
he
is
said
lucille
regarding
her
husband
affectionately
he
eats
a
lot
of
fish
bill
that
what
makes
him
so
clever
shrimps
diagnosed
bill
churlishly
do
you
know
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
in
the
restaurant
downstairs
asked
archie
ignoring
the
slur
i
know
there
is
a
leader
of
the
orchestra
what
about
him
a
sound
fellow
great
pal
of
mine
i
forgotten
his
name
call
him
pootles
suggested
lucille
desist
said
archie
as
a
wordless
growl
proceeded
from
his
stricken
temper
your
hilarity
with
a
modicum
of
reserve
this
girlish
frivolity
is
unseemly
well
i
going
to
have
a
chat
with
this
chappie
and
fix
it
all
fix
what
up
the
whole
jolly
business
i
going
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
i
a
composer
chappie
popping
about
in
the
background
whose
one
ambish
is
to
have
his
pet
song
sung
before
a
discriminating
audience
you
have
a
singer
straining
at
the
leash
i
going
to
arrange
with
this
egg
who
leads
the
orchestra
that
your
female
shall
sing
my
song
downstairs
one
night
during
dinner
how
about
it
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
ball
of
fire
it
not
a
bad
idea
admitted
bill
brightening
visibly
i
have
thought
you
had
it
in
why
not
well
it
a
capital
idea
said
lucille
quite
out
of
the
question
of
how
do
you
mean
do
you
know
that
the
one
thing
father
hates
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
is
anything
like
a
cabaret
people
are
always
coming
to
him
suggesting
that
it
would
brighten
up
the
dinner
hour
if
he
had
singers
and
things
and
he
crushes
them
into
little
bits
he
thinks
there
nothing
that
lowers
the
tone
of
a
place
more
he
bite
you
in
three
places
when
you
suggest
it
to
him
ah
but
has
it
escaped
your
notice
lighting
system
of
my
soul
that
the
dear
old
dad
is
not
at
present
in
residence
he
went
off
to
fish
at
lake
this
you
are
dreaming
of
doing
this
without
asking
him
that
was
the
general
but
he
be
furious
when
he
finds
but
will
he
find
out
i
ask
you
will
he
of
course
he
i
do
see
why
he
should
said
bill
on
whose
plastic
mind
the
plan
had
made
a
deep
impression
he
wo
said
archie
confidently
this
wheeze
is
for
one
night
only
by
the
time
the
jolly
old
returns
bitten
to
the
bone
by
mosquitoes
with
one
small
stuffed
trout
in
his
everything
will
be
over
and
all
quiet
once
more
along
the
potomac
the
scheme
is
this
my
chappie
wants
his
song
heard
by
a
publisher
your
girl
wants
her
voice
heard
by
one
of
the
blighters
who
get
up
concerts
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
no
doubt
you
know
such
a
bird
whom
you
could
invite
to
the
hotel
for
a
bit
of
dinner
i
know
carl
steinburg
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
thinking
of
writing
to
him
about
you
absolutely
sure
that
is
her
name
said
archie
his
voice
still
tinged
with
incredulity
oh
well
i
suppose
she
told
you
so
herself
and
no
doubt
she
knows
best
that
will
be
topping
rope
in
your
pal
and
hold
him
down
at
the
table
till
the
finish
lucille
the
beautiful
vision
on
the
yonder
and
i
will
be
at
another
table
entertaining
maxie
blumenthal
who
on
earth
is
maxie
blumenthal
asked
lucille
one
of
my
boyhood
chums
a
i
get
him
to
come
along
and
then
we
all
be
set
at
the
conclusion
of
the
performance
miss
archie
winced
miss
spectatia
huskisson
will
be
signed
up
for
a
forty
weeks
tour
and
jovial
old
blumenthal
will
be
making
all
arrangements
for
publishing
the
song
two
birds
as
i
indicated
before
with
one
stone
how
about
it
it
a
winner
said
bill
of
course
said
archie
i
not
urging
you
i
merely
make
the
suggestion
if
you
know
a
better
go
to
it
it
terrific
said
bill
it
absurd
said
lucille
my
dear
old
partner
of
joys
and
sorrows
said
archie
wounded
we
court
criticism
but
this
is
mere
abuse
what
seems
to
be
the
difficulty
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
would
be
afraid
to
do
ten
dollars
supplied
by
william
here
push
it
over
bill
old
man
will
remove
his
and
father
certain
to
find
am
i
afraid
of
father
cried
archie
manfully
well
yes
i
am
he
added
after
a
moment
reflection
but
i
do
see
how
he
can
possibly
get
to
of
course
he
ca
said
bill
decidedly
fix
it
up
as
soon
as
you
can
archie
this
is
what
the
doctor
chapter
xxiv
the
melting
of
connolly
the
main
of
the
hotel
cosmopolis
is
a
decorous
place
the
lighting
is
artistically
dim
and
the
genuine
old
tapestries
on
the
walls
seem
with
their
mediaeval
calm
to
discourage
any
essay
in
the
riotous
waiters
shimmer
to
and
fro
over
thick
expensive
carpets
to
the
music
of
an
orchestra
which
abstains
wholly
from
the
noisy
modernity
of
jazz
to
archie
who
during
the
past
few
days
had
been
privileged
to
hear
miss
huskisson
rehearsing
the
place
had
a
sort
of
brooding
quiet
like
the
ocean
just
before
the
arrival
of
a
cyclone
as
lucille
had
said
miss
huskisson
voice
was
loud
it
was
a
powerful
organ
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
would
take
the
cloistered
stillness
of
the
cosmopolis
and
stand
it
on
one
ear
almost
unconsciously
archie
found
himself
bracing
his
muscles
and
holding
his
breath
as
he
had
done
in
france
at
the
approach
of
the
zero
hour
when
awaiting
the
first
roar
of
a
barrage
he
listened
mechanically
to
the
conversation
of
blumenthal
the
was
talking
with
some
vehemence
on
the
subject
of
labour
a
recent
printers
strike
had
bitten
deeply
into
blumenthal
soul
the
working
man
he
considered
was
rapidly
landing
god
country
in
the
soup
and
he
had
twice
upset
his
glass
with
the
vehemence
of
his
gesticulation
he
was
an
energetic
talker
the
more
you
give
the
more
they
want
he
complained
there
no
pleasing
it
is
only
in
my
business
there
your
father
moffam
good
god
where
said
archie
starting
i
say
take
your
father
case
he
doing
all
he
knows
to
get
this
new
hotel
of
his
finished
and
what
happens
a
man
gets
fired
for
loafing
on
his
job
and
connolly
calls
a
strike
and
the
building
operations
are
held
up
till
the
thing
settled
it
is
right
it
a
great
shame
agreed
lucille
i
was
reading
about
it
in
the
paper
this
that
man
connolly
a
tough
guy
you
think
being
a
personal
friend
of
your
father
he
would
i
did
know
they
were
been
friends
for
years
but
a
lot
of
difference
that
makes
out
come
the
men
just
the
same
it
is
right
i
was
saying
it
was
right
repeated
blumenthal
to
archie
for
he
was
a
man
who
liked
the
attention
of
every
member
of
his
audience
archie
did
not
reply
he
was
staring
glassily
across
the
room
at
two
men
who
had
just
come
in
one
was
a
large
stout
man
of
commanding
personality
the
other
was
daniel
brewster
blumenthal
followed
his
gaze
why
there
is
connolly
coming
in
now
father
gasped
lucille
her
eyes
met
archie
archie
took
a
hasty
drink
of
this
he
murmured
has
torn
it
archie
you
must
do
something
i
know
but
what
what
the
trouble
enquired
blumenthal
mystified
go
over
to
their
table
and
talk
to
them
said
lucille
me
archie
quivered
no
i
say
old
thing
really
get
them
away
how
do
you
mean
i
know
cried
lucille
inspired
father
promised
that
you
should
be
manager
of
the
new
hotel
when
it
was
built
well
then
this
strike
affects
you
just
as
much
as
anybody
else
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
talk
it
over
with
them
go
and
ask
them
to
have
dinner
up
in
our
suite
where
you
can
discuss
it
quietly
say
that
up
there
they
wo
be
disturbed
by
the
the
at
this
moment
while
archie
wavered
hesitating
like
a
diver
on
the
edge
of
a
who
is
trying
to
summon
up
the
necessary
nerve
to
project
himself
into
the
deep
a
approached
the
table
where
the
brewster
and
connolly
had
seated
themselves
he
murmured
something
in
brewster
ear
and
the
proprietor
of
the
cosmopolis
rose
and
followed
him
out
of
the
room
quick
now
your
chance
said
lucille
eagerly
father
been
called
to
the
telephone
hurry
archie
took
another
drink
of
to
steady
his
shaking
pulled
down
his
waistcoat
straightened
his
tie
and
then
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
roman
gladiator
entering
the
arena
tottered
across
the
room
lucille
turned
to
entertain
the
perplexed
the
nearer
archie
got
to
aloysius
connolly
the
less
did
he
like
the
looks
of
him
even
at
a
distance
the
labour
leader
had
had
a
formidable
aspect
seen
close
to
he
looked
even
more
uninviting
his
face
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
carved
out
of
granite
and
the
eye
which
collided
with
archie
as
the
latter
with
an
attempt
at
an
ingratiating
smile
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
the
table
was
hard
and
frosty
connolly
gave
the
impression
that
he
would
be
a
good
man
to
have
on
your
side
during
a
fight
down
on
the
or
in
some
but
he
did
not
look
chummy
said
archie
who
the
devil
inquired
connolly
are
you
my
name
archibald
that
not
my
i
jolly
old
brewster
glad
to
meet
glad
to
meet
you
said
archie
handsomely
well
said
connolly
eh
run
along
and
sell
your
papers
your
and
i
have
business
to
yes
i
private
added
connolly
oh
but
i
in
on
this
binge
you
know
i
going
to
be
the
manager
of
the
new
you
absolutely
well
well
said
connolly
noncommittally
archie
pleased
with
the
smoothness
with
which
matters
had
opened
bent
forward
winsomely
i
say
you
know
it
wo
do
you
know
absolutely
no
not
a
bit
like
it
no
no
far
from
it
well
how
about
it
how
do
we
go
what
yes
no
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
call
it
off
old
thing
call
what
off
this
festive
old
not
on
your
hallo
dan
back
again
brewster
looming
over
the
table
like
a
thundercloud
regarded
archie
with
more
than
his
customary
hostility
life
was
no
pleasant
thing
for
the
proprietor
of
the
cosmopolis
just
now
once
a
man
starts
building
hotels
the
thing
becomes
like
any
hitch
any
sudden
of
the
daily
dose
has
the
worst
effects
and
the
strike
which
was
holding
up
the
construction
of
his
latest
effort
had
plunged
brewster
into
a
restless
gloom
in
addition
to
having
this
strike
on
his
hands
he
had
had
to
abandon
his
annual
just
when
he
had
begun
to
enjoy
it
and
as
if
all
this
were
not
enough
here
was
his
sitting
at
his
table
brewster
had
a
feeling
that
this
was
more
than
man
was
meant
to
bear
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
hallo
old
thing
said
archie
come
and
join
the
party
do
call
me
old
thing
old
companion
just
as
you
say
i
say
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
to
connolly
that
we
should
all
go
up
to
my
suite
and
talk
this
business
over
he
says
he
the
manager
of
your
new
hotel
said
connolly
is
that
right
i
suppose
so
said
brewster
gloomily
then
i
doing
you
a
kindness
said
connolly
in
not
letting
it
be
archie
dabbed
at
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
the
moments
were
flying
and
it
began
to
seem
impossible
to
shift
these
two
men
connolly
was
as
firmly
settled
in
his
chair
as
some
primeval
rock
as
for
brewster
he
too
had
seated
himself
and
was
gazing
at
archie
with
a
weary
repulsion
brewster
glance
always
made
archie
feel
as
though
there
were
soup
on
his
and
suddenly
from
the
orchestra
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
there
came
a
familiar
sound
the
prelude
of
mother
so
you
started
a
cabaret
dan
said
connolly
in
a
satisfied
voice
i
always
told
you
you
were
behind
the
times
here
brewster
jumped
cabaret
he
stared
unbelievingly
at
the
figure
which
had
just
mounted
the
orchestra
dais
and
then
concentrated
his
gaze
on
archie
archie
would
not
have
looked
at
his
at
this
juncture
if
he
had
had
a
free
and
untrammelled
choice
but
brewster
eye
drew
his
with
something
of
the
fascination
which
a
snake
has
for
a
rabbit
brewster
eye
was
fiery
and
intimidating
a
basilisk
might
have
gone
to
him
with
advantage
for
a
course
of
lessons
his
gaze
went
right
through
archie
till
the
latter
seemed
to
feel
his
curling
crisply
in
the
flames
is
this
one
of
your
even
in
this
tense
moment
archie
found
time
almost
unconsciously
to
admire
his
penetration
and
intuition
he
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
no
doubt
this
was
how
great
fortunes
were
made
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
absolutely
accurate
it
was
like
this
say
cut
it
out
said
connolly
can
the
chatter
i
want
to
archie
was
only
too
ready
to
oblige
him
conversation
at
the
moment
was
the
last
thing
he
himself
desired
he
managed
with
a
strong
effort
to
disengage
himself
from
brewster
eye
and
turned
to
the
orchestra
dais
where
miss
spectatia
huskisson
was
now
beginning
the
first
verse
of
wilson
hymack
masterpiece
miss
huskisson
like
so
many
of
the
female
denizens
of
the
middle
west
was
tall
and
blonde
and
constructed
on
substantial
lines
she
was
a
girl
whose
appearance
suggested
the
old
homestead
and
fried
pancakes
and
pop
coming
home
to
dinner
after
the
morning
ploughing
even
her
bobbed
hair
did
not
altogether
destroy
this
impression
she
looked
big
and
strong
and
healthy
and
her
lungs
were
obviously
good
she
attacked
the
verse
of
the
song
with
something
of
the
vigour
and
breadth
of
treatment
with
which
in
other
days
she
had
reasoned
with
refractory
mules
her
diction
was
the
diction
of
one
trained
to
call
the
cattle
home
in
the
teeth
of
western
hurricanes
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
you
heard
every
word
the
subdued
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
had
ceased
the
diners
unused
to
this
sort
of
thing
at
the
cosmopolis
were
trying
to
adjust
their
faculties
to
cope
with
the
outburst
waiters
stood
transfixed
frozen
in
attitudes
of
service
in
the
momentary
lull
between
verse
and
refrain
archie
could
hear
the
deep
breathing
of
brewster
involuntarily
he
turned
to
gaze
at
him
once
more
as
refugees
from
pompeii
may
have
turned
to
gaze
upon
vesuvius
and
as
he
did
so
he
caught
sight
of
connolly
and
paused
in
astonishment
connolly
was
an
altered
man
his
whole
personality
had
undergone
a
subtle
change
his
face
still
looked
as
though
hewn
from
the
living
rock
but
into
his
eyes
had
crept
an
expression
which
in
another
man
might
almost
have
been
called
sentimental
incredible
as
it
seemed
to
archie
connolly
eyes
were
dreamy
there
was
even
in
them
a
suggestion
of
unshed
tears
and
when
with
a
vast
culmination
of
sound
miss
huskisson
reached
the
high
note
at
the
end
of
the
refrain
and
after
holding
it
as
some
spent
but
victorious
holds
the
summit
of
a
redoubt
broke
off
suddenly
in
the
stillness
which
followed
there
proceeded
from
connolly
a
deep
sigh
miss
huskisson
began
the
second
verse
and
brewster
seeming
to
recover
from
some
kind
of
a
trance
leaped
to
his
feet
great
godfrey
sit
down
said
connolly
in
a
broken
voice
sit
down
dan
he
went
back
to
his
mother
on
the
train
that
very
day
he
knew
there
was
no
other
who
could
make
him
bright
and
gay
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
he
whispered
come
home
he
told
her
he
was
never
going
any
more
to
roam
and
onward
through
the
happy
years
till
he
grew
old
and
grey
he
never
once
regretted
those
brave
words
he
once
did
say
it
a
long
way
back
to
mother
knee
the
last
high
note
screeched
across
the
room
like
a
shell
and
the
applause
that
followed
was
like
a
shell
bursting
one
could
hardly
have
recognised
the
refined
interior
of
the
cosmopolis
fair
women
were
waving
napkins
brave
men
were
hammering
on
the
tables
with
the
of
knives
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
imagined
themselves
to
be
in
one
of
those
distressing
places
miss
huskisson
bowed
retired
returned
bowed
and
retired
again
the
tears
streaming
down
her
ample
face
over
in
a
corner
archie
could
see
his
clapping
strenuously
a
waiter
with
a
display
of
manly
emotion
that
did
him
credit

order
of

shaking
voice

interrupted
him
violently

on
archie

the
devil

wiping
away
a
tear
with
his

my

a
frightfully
sorry
and
all
that
old
companion
thirty
years
ago
last
october
was
a
fine
autumn
evening
the
finest
ye
ever
wish
to
see
me
old
mother
she
came
to
the
station
to
see
me
brewster
who
was
not
deeply
interested
in
connolly
old
mother
continued
to
splutter
inarticulately
like
a
firework
trying
to
go
off
always

a
good
boy
aloysius
she
said
to
me

proceeding
with
his
autobiography
and
i

and
applied
the
napkin
again

a
liar
i
was
he
observed
remorsefully
many
the
dirty
i
played
since
then
a
long
way
back
to
mother
knee
is
a
true
word
he
turned
impulsively
to
brewster
dan
there
a
deal
of
trouble
in
this
world
without
me
going
out
of
me
way
to
make
more
the
strike
is
over
i
send
the
men
back
tomorrow
there
me
hand
on
it
brewster
who
had
just
managed
to
his
views
on
the
situation
and
was
about
to
express
them
with
the
generous
strength
which
was
ever
his
custom
when
dealing
with
his
checked
himself
abruptly
he
stared
at
his
old
friend
and
business
enemy
wondering
if
he
could
have
heard
aright
hope
began
to
creep
back
into
heart
like
a
shamefaced
dog
that
has
been
away
from
home
hunting
for
a
day
or
two
you
what
i
send
the
men
back
that
song
was
sent
to
guide
me
dan
it
was
meant
thirty
years
ago
last
october
me
dear
old
mother
brewster
bent
forward
attentively
his
views
on
connolly
dear
old
mother
had
changed
he
wanted
to
hear
all
about
her
was
that
last
note
that
girl
sang
brought
it
all
back
to
me
as
if
yesterday
as
we
waited
on
the
platform
me
old
mother
and
i
out
comes
the
train
from
the
tunnel
and
the
engine
lets
off
a
screech
the
way
ye
hear
it
ten
miles
away
was
thirty
years
ago
archie
stole
softly
from
the
table
he
felt
that
his
presence
if
it
had
ever
been
required
was
required
no
longer
looking
back
he
could
see
his
patting
connolly
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
archie
and
lucille
lingered
over
their
coffee
blumenthal
was
out
in
the
settling
the
business
end
with
wilson
hymack
the
had
been
unstinted
in
his
praise
of
mother
it
was
he
said
the
words
stated
blumenthal
were
gooey
enough
to
hurt
and
the
tune
reminded
him
of
every
other
he
had
ever
heard
there
was
in
blumenthal
opinion
nothing
to
stop
this
thing
selling
a
million
copies
archie
smoked
contentedly
not
a
bad
evening
work
old
thing
he
said
talk
about
birds
with
one
stone
he
looked
at
lucille
reproachfully
you
do
seem
bubbling
over
with
oh
i
am
precious
lucille
sighed
i
was
only
thinking
about
what
about
bill
well
it
rather
awful
to
think
of
him
tied
for
life
to
oh
we
must
look
on
the
jolly
old
dark
side
perhaps
hallo
bill
old
top
we
were
just
talking
about
were
you
said
bill
brewster
in
a
dispirited
voice
i
take
it
that
you
want
congratulations
what
i
want
sympathy
sympathy
sympathy
and
lots
of
it
she
gone
gone
who
spectatia
how
do
you
mean
gone
bill
glowered
at
the
tablecloth
gone
home
i
just
seen
her
off
in
a
cab
she
gone
back
to
washington
square
to
pack
she
catching
the
ten
train
back
to
snake
bite
it
was
that
damned
song
muttered
bill
in
a
stricken
voice
she
says
she
never
realised
before
she
sang
it
how
hollow
new
york
was
she
said
it
suddenly
came
over
her
she
says
going
to
give
up
her
career
and
go
back
to
her
mother
what
the
deuce
are
you
twiddling
your
fingers
for
he
broke
off
irritably
sorry
old
man
i
was
just
counting
counting
what
birds
old
thing
only
birds
said
archie
chapter
xxv
the
wigmore
venus
the
morning
was
so
brilliantly
fine
the
populace
popped
to
and
fro
in
so
active
and
cheery
a
manner
and
everybody
appeared
to
be
so
absolutely
in
the
pink
that
a
casual
observer
of
the
city
of
new
york
would
have
said
that
it
was
one
of
those
happy
days
yet
archie
moffam
as
he
turned
out
of
the
street
into
the
ramshackle
building
on
the
third
floor
of
which
was
the
studio
belonging
to
his
artist
friend
james
wheeler
was
faintly
oppressed
with
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
feeling
that
something
was
wrong
he
would
not
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
had
the
pip
it
was
more
a
vague
sense
of
discomfort
and
searching
for
first
causes
as
he
made
his
way
upstairs
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
person
responsible
for
this
nebulous
depression
was
his
wife
lucille
it
seemed
to
archie
that
at
breakfast
that
morning
lucille
manner
had
been
subtly
rummy
nothing
you
could
put
your
finger
on
still
rummy
musing
thus
he
reached
the
studio
and
found
the
door
open
and
the
room
empty
it
had
the
air
of
a
room
whose
owner
has
dashed
in
to
fetch
his
and
biffed
off
after
the
casual
fashion
of
the
artist
temperament
without
bothering
to
close
up
behind
him
and
such
indeed
was
the
case
the
studio
had
seen
the
last
of
j
wheeler
for
that
day
but
archie
not
realising
this
and
feeling
that
a
chat
with
wheeler
who
was
a
bird
was
what
he
needed
this
morning
sat
down
to
wait
after
a
few
moments
his
gaze
straying
over
the
room
encountered
a
handsomely
framed
picture
and
he
went
across
to
take
a
look
at
it
j
wheeler
was
an
artist
who
made
a
large
annual
income
as
an
illustrator
for
the
magazines
and
it
was
a
surprise
to
archie
to
find
that
he
also
went
in
for
this
kind
of
thing
for
the
picture
dashingly
painted
in
oils
represented
a
comfortably
plump
young
woman
who
from
her
rather
simper
and
the
fact
that
she
wore
absolutely
nothing
except
a
small
dove
on
her
left
shoulder
was
plainly
intended
to
be
the
goddess
venus
archie
was
not
much
of
a
lad
around
the
but
he
knew
enough
about
art
to
recognise
venus
when
he
saw
her
though
once
or
twice
it
is
true
artists
had
him
by
ringing
in
some
such
title
as
day
dreams
or
when
the
heart
is
he
inspected
this
picture
for
awhile
then
returning
to
his
seat
lit
a
cigarette
and
began
to
meditate
on
lucille
once
more
yes
the
dear
girl
had
been
rummy
at
breakfast
she
had
not
exactly
said
anything
or
done
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
but
well
you
know
how
it
is
we
husbands
we
lads
of
the
brigade
we
learn
to
pierce
the
mask
there
had
been
in
lucille
manner
that
curious
strained
sweetness
which
comes
to
women
whose
husbands
have
failed
to
match
the
piece
of
silk
or
forgotten
to
post
an
important
letter
if
his
conscience
had
not
been
as
clear
as
crystal
archie
would
have
said
that
that
was
what
must
have
been
the
matter
but
when
lucille
wrote
letters
she
just
stepped
out
of
the
suite
and
dropped
them
in
the
attached
to
the
elevator
it
could
be
that
and
he
could
have
forgotten
anything
else
because
oh
my
sainted
aunt
archie
cigarette
smouldered
neglected
between
his
fingers
his
jaw
had
fallen
and
his
eyes
were
staring
glassily
before
him
he
was
appalled
his
memory
was
weak
he
knew
but
never
before
had
it
let
him
down
so
scurvily
as
this
this
was
a
record
it
stood
in
a
class
by
itself
printed
in
red
ink
and
marked
with
a
star
as
the
bloomer
of
a
lifetime
for
a
man
may
forget
many
things
he
may
forget
his
name
his
umbrella
his
nationality
his
spats
and
the
friends
of
his
youth
but
there
is
one
thing
which
your
married
man
your
lizard
must
not
forget
and
that
is
the
anniversary
of
his
remorse
swept
over
archie
like
a
wave
his
heart
bled
for
lucille
no
wonder
the
poor
girl
had
been
rummy
at
breakfast
what
girl
would
be
rummy
at
breakfast
tied
for
life
to
a
ghastly
outsider
like
himself
he
groaned
hollowly
and
sagged
forlornly
in
his
chair
and
as
he
did
so
the
venus
caught
his
eye
for
it
was
an
picture
you
might
like
it
or
dislike
it
but
you
could
not
ignore
it
as
a
strong
swimmer
shoots
to
the
surface
after
a
high
dive
soul
rose
suddenly
from
the
depths
to
which
it
had
descended
he
did
not
often
get
inspirations
but
he
got
one
now
hope
dawned
with
a
jerk
the
one
way
out
had
presented
itself
to
him
a
rich
present
that
was
the
wheeze
if
he
returned
to
her
bearing
a
rich
present
he
might
with
the
help
of
heaven
and
a
face
of
brass
succeed
in
making
her
believe
that
he
had
merely
pretended
to
forget
the
vital
date
in
order
to
enhance
the
surprise
it
was
a
scheme
like
some
great
general
forming
his
plan
of
campaign
on
the
eve
of
battle
archie
had
the
whole
binge
neatly
worked
out
inside
a
minute
he
scribbled
a
note
to
wheeler
explaining
the
situation
and
promising
reasonable
payment
on
the
instalment
system
then
placing
the
note
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
easel
he
leaped
to
the
telephone
and
presently
found
himself
connected
with
lucille
room
at
the
cosmopolis
hullo
darling
he
cooed
there
was
a
slight
pause
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
oh
hullo
archie
lucille
voice
was
dull
and
listless
and
archie
experienced
ear
could
detect
that
she
had
been
crying
he
raised
his
right
foot
and
kicked
himself
indignantly
on
the
left
ankle
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
old
thing
a
muffled
sob
floated
over
the
wire
have
you
only
just
remembered
said
lucille
in
a
small
voice
archie
bracing
himself
up
cackled
gleefully
into
the
receiver
did
i
take
you
in
light
of
my
home
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
thought
i
had
forgotten
for
heaven
sake
you
did
say
a
word
at
ah
but
that
was
all
part
of
the
devilish
cunning
i
had
got
a
present
for
you
then
at
least
i
did
know
whether
it
was
oh
archie
you
darling
lucille
voice
had
lost
its
crushed
melancholy
she
trilled
like
a
thrush
or
a
linnet
or
any
bird
that
goes
in
largely
for
trilling
have
you
really
got
me
a
present
it
here
now
the
dickens
of
a
fruity
picture
one
of
j
things
you
like
oh
i
know
i
shall
i
love
his
work
you
are
an
angel
we
hang
it
over
the
i
be
round
with
it
in
something
under
three
ticks
star
of
my
soul
i
take
a
yes
do
hurry
i
want
to
hug
you
said
archie
i
take
two
it
is
not
far
from
washington
square
to
the
hotel
cosmopolis
and
archie
made
the
journey
without
mishap
there
was
a
little
unpleasantness
with
the
cabman
before
starting
he
on
the
prudish
plea
that
he
was
a
married
man
with
a
local
reputation
to
keep
up
declining
at
first
to
be
seen
in
company
with
the
masterpiece
but
on
archie
giving
a
promise
to
keep
the
front
of
the
picture
away
from
the
public
gaze
he
consented
to
take
the
job
on
and
some
ten
minutes
later
having
made
his
way
blushfully
through
the
hotel
lobby
and
endured
the
frank
curiosity
of
the
boy
who
worked
the
elevator
archie
entered
his
suite
the
picture
under
his
arm
he
placed
it
carefully
against
the
wall
in
order
to
leave
himself
more
scope
for
embracing
lucille
and
when
the
joyful
reunion
or
the
sacred
scene
if
you
prefer
so
to
call
it
was
concluded
he
stepped
forward
to
turn
it
round
and
exhibit
it
why
it
enormous
said
lucille
i
did
know
wheeler
ever
painted
pictures
that
size
when
you
said
it
was
one
of
his
i
thought
it
must
be
the
original
of
a
magazine
drawing
or
something
like
oh
archie
had
moved
back
and
given
her
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
work
of
art
and
she
had
started
as
if
some
unkindly
disposed
person
had
driven
a
bradawl
into
her
pretty
ripe
what
said
archie
enthusiastically
lucille
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
it
may
have
been
sudden
joy
that
kept
her
silent
or
on
the
other
hand
it
may
not
she
stood
looking
at
the
picture
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
a
bird
eh
said
archie
y
yes
said
lucille
i
knew
you
like
it
proceeded
archie
with
animation
you
see
you
by
way
of
being
a
know
all
about
the
things
and
what
not
inherit
it
from
the
dear
old
dad
i
should
wonder
personally
i
ca
tell
one
picture
from
another
as
a
rule
but
bound
to
say
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
this
i
said
to
myself
ho
or
words
to
that
effect
i
rather
think
this
will
add
a
touch
of
distinction
to
the
home
yes
no
i
hang
it
up
shall
i
down
to
the
office
light
of
my
soul
and
tell
them
to
send
up
a
nail
a
bit
of
string
and
the
hotel
one
moment
darling
i
not
quite
eh
where
it
ought
to
hang
i
mean
you
see
over
the
piano
you
said
the
jolly
old
yes
but
i
had
seen
it
a
monstrous
suspicion
flitted
for
an
instant
into
archie
mind
i
say
you
do
like
it
do
you
he
said
anxiously
oh
archie
darling
of
course
i
do
it
was
so
sweet
of
you
to
give
it
to
me
but
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
this
picture
is
so
so
striking
that
i
feel
that
we
ought
to
wait
a
little
while
and
decide
where
it
would
have
the
best
effect
the
light
over
the
piano
is
rather
you
think
it
ought
to
hang
in
a
dimmish
light
what
yes
yes
the
dimmer
the
i
mean
yes
in
a
dim
light
suppose
we
leave
it
in
the
corner
for
the
moment
over
there
behind
the
sofa
and
and
i
think
it
over
it
wants
a
lot
of
thought
you
here
yes
that
will
do
splendidly
oh
and
hullo
i
think
perhaps
just
turn
its
face
to
the
wall
will
you
lucille
gave
a
little
gulp
it
will
prevent
it
getting
it
perplexed
archie
a
little
during
the
next
few
days
to
notice
in
lucille
whom
he
had
always
looked
on
as
a
girl
who
knew
her
own
mind
a
curious
streak
of
vacillation
quite
half
a
dozen
times
he
suggested
various
spots
on
the
wall
as
suitable
for
the
venus
but
lucille
seemed
unable
to
decide
archie
wished
that
she
would
settle
on
something
definite
for
he
wanted
to
invite
j
wheeler
to
the
suite
to
see
the
thing
he
had
heard
nothing
from
the
artist
since
the
day
he
had
removed
the
picture
and
one
morning
encountering
him
on
broadway
he
expressed
his
appreciation
of
the
very
decent
manner
in
which
the
other
had
taken
the
whole
affair
oh
that
said
j
wheeler
my
dear
fellow
you
he
paused
for
a
moment
more
than
welcome
he
added
you
are
much
of
an
expert
on
pictures
are
you
well
said
archie
i
do
know
that
you
call
me
an
absolute
nib
do
you
know
but
of
course
i
know
enough
to
see
that
this
particular
exhibit
is
not
a
little
fruity
absolutely
one
of
the
best
things
ever
done
a
slight
purple
tinge
manifested
itself
in
wheeler
round
and
rosy
face
his
eyes
bulged
what
are
you
talking
about
you
tishbite
you
misguided
son
of
belial
are
you
under
the
impression
that
painted
that
thing
did
you
wheeler
swallowed
a
little
convulsively
my
fiancee
painted
it
he
said
shortly
your
fiancee
my
dear
old
lad
i
did
know
you
were
engaged
who
is
she
do
i
know
her
her
name
is
alice
wigmore
you
do
know
and
she
painted
that
picture
archie
was
perturbed
but
i
say
she
be
apt
to
wonder
where
the
thing
has
got
to
i
told
her
it
had
been
stolen
she
thought
it
a
great
compliment
and
was
tickled
to
death
so
that
all
and
of
course
she
paint
you
not
while
i
have
my
strength
she
wo
said
j
wheeler
firmly
she
given
up
painting
since
i
taught
her
golf
thank
goodness
and
my
best
efforts
shall
be
employed
in
seeing
that
she
does
have
a
but
laddie
said
archie
puzzled
you
talk
as
though
there
were
something
wrong
with
the
picture
i
thought
it
dashed
hot
god
bless
you
said
j
wheeler
archie
proceeded
on
his
way
still
mystified
then
he
reflected
that
artists
as
a
class
were
all
pretty
weird
and
rummy
and
talked
more
or
less
consistently
through
their
hats
you
could
ever
take
an
opinion
on
a
picture
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
had
views
on
art
which
would
have
admitted
them
to
any
and
no
questions
asked
he
had
met
several
of
the
species
who
absolutely
raved
over
things
which
any
reasonable
chappie
would
decline
to
be
found
dead
in
a
ditch
with
his
admiration
for
the
wigmore
venus
which
had
faltered
for
a
moment
during
his
conversation
with
j
wheeler
returned
in
all
its
pristine
vigour
absolute
rot
he
meant
to
say
to
try
to
make
out
that
it
one
of
the
ones
and
just
like
mother
used
to
make
look
how
lucille
had
liked
it
at
breakfast
next
morning
archie
once
more
brought
up
the
question
of
the
hanging
of
the
picture
it
was
absurd
to
let
a
thing
like
that
go
on
wasting
its
sweetness
behind
a
sofa
with
its
face
to
the
wall
touching
the
jolly
old
masterpiece
he
said
how
about
it
i
think
it
time
we
hoisted
it
up
lucille
fiddled
pensively
with
her
archie
dear
she
said
i
been
and
a
very
good
thing
to
do
said
archie
i
often
meant
to
do
it
myself
when
i
got
a
bit
of
about
that
picture
i
mean
did
you
know
it
was
father
birthday
why
no
old
thing
i
did
to
be
absolutely
honest
your
revered
parent
does
confide
in
me
much
these
days
as
a
matter
of
well
it
is
and
i
think
we
ought
to
give
him
a
absolutely
but
how
i
all
for
spreading
sweetness
and
light
and
cheering
up
the
jolly
old
pater
sorrowful
existence
but
i
have
a
bean
and
what
is
more
things
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
i
scan
the
horizon
without
seeing
a
single
soul
i
can
touch
i
suppose
i
could
get
into
reggie
van
tuyl
ribs
for
a
bit
but
i
do
know
touching
poor
old
reggie
always
seems
to
me
rather
like
potting
a
sitting
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
do
anything
like
that
i
was
thinking
archie
darling
would
you
be
very
hurt
if
i
gave
father
the
picture
oh
i
say
well
i
ca
think
of
anything
but
would
you
miss
it
most
frightfully
oh
of
course
i
should
but
you
see
father
birthday
archie
had
always
thought
lucille
the
dearest
and
most
unselfish
angel
in
the
world
but
never
had
the
fact
come
home
to
him
so
forcibly
as
now
he
kissed
her
fondly
by
jove
he
exclaimed
you
really
are
you
know
this
is
the
biggest
thing
since
jolly
old
sir
philip
gave
the
drink
of
water
to
the
poor
blighter
whose
need
was
greater
than
his
if
you
recall
the
incident
i
had
to
sweat
it
up
at
school
i
remember
sir
philip
poor
old
bean
had
a
most
ghastly
thirst
on
and
he
was
just
going
to
have
one
on
the
house
so
to
speak
when
but
it
all
in
the
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
boy
scouts
do
well
of
course
it
up
to
you
queen
of
my
soul
if
you
feel
like
making
the
sacrifice
shall
i
bring
the
pater
up
here
and
show
him
the
picture
no
i
should
do
that
do
you
think
you
could
get
into
his
suite
morning
and
hang
it
up
somewhere
you
see
if
he
had
the
chance
of
what
i
mean
is
if
yes
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
hang
it
up
and
let
him
discover
it
it
would
give
him
a
surprise
you
mean
what
lucille
sighed
inaudibly
she
was
a
girl
with
a
conscience
and
that
conscience
was
troubling
her
a
little
she
agreed
with
archie
that
the
discovery
of
the
wigmore
venus
in
his
artistically
furnished
suite
would
give
brewster
a
surprise
surprise
indeed
was
perhaps
an
inadequate
word
she
was
sorry
for
her
father
but
the
instinct
of
is
stronger
than
any
other
emotion
archie
whistled
merrily
on
the
following
morning
as
having
driven
a
nail
into
his
wallpaper
he
adjusted
the
cord
from
which
the
wigmore
venus
was
suspended
he
was
a
young
man
and
though
daniel
brewster
had
on
many
occasions
treated
him
with
a
good
deal
of
austerity
his
simple
soul
was
pleased
at
the
thought
of
doing
him
a
good
turn
he
had
just
completed
his
work
and
was
stepping
cautiously
down
when
a
voice
behind
him
nearly
caused
him
to
overbalance
what
the
devil
archie
turned
beamingly
hullo
old
thing
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
brewster
was
standing
in
a
frozen
attitude
his
strong
face
was
slightly
flushed
what
what
he
gurgled
brewster
was
not
in
one
of
his
sunniest
moods
that
morning
the
proprietor
of
a
large
hotel
has
many
things
to
disturb
him
and
things
had
been
going
wrong
he
had
come
up
to
his
suite
with
the
idea
of
restoring
his
shaken
nerve
system
with
a
quiet
cigar
and
the
sight
of
his
had
as
so
frequently
happened
made
him
feel
worse
than
ever
but
when
archie
had
descended
from
the
chair
and
moved
aside
to
allow
him
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
picture
brewster
realised
that
a
worse
thing
had
befallen
him
than
a
mere
visit
from
one
who
always
made
him
feel
that
the
world
was
a
bleak
place
he
stared
at
the
venus
dumbly
unlike
most
daniel
brewster
was
a
connoisseur
of
art
connoisseuring
was
in
fact
his
hobby
even
the
public
rooms
of
the
cosmopolis
were
decorated
with
taste
and
his
own
private
suite
was
a
shrine
of
all
that
was
best
and
most
artistic
his
tastes
were
quiet
and
restrained
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
wigmore
venus
hit
him
behind
the
ear
like
a
stuffed
so
great
was
the
shock
that
for
some
moments
it
kept
him
silent
and
before
he
could
recover
speech
archie
had
explained
it
a
birthday
present
from
lucille
do
you
brewster
crushed
down
the
breezy
speech
he
had
intended
to
utter
lucille
gave
me
that
he
muttered
he
swallowed
pathetically
he
was
suffering
but
the
iron
courage
of
the
brewsters
stood
him
in
good
stead
this
man
was
no
weakling
presently
the
rigidity
of
his
face
relaxed
he
was
himself
again
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
loved
his
daughter
most
and
if
in
whatever
mood
of
temporary
insanity
she
had
brought
herself
to
suppose
that
this
beastly
daub
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
would
like
for
a
birthday
present
he
must
accept
the
situation
like
a
man
he
would
on
the
whole
have
preferred
death
to
a
life
lived
in
the
society
of
the
wigmore
venus
but
even
that
torment
must
be
endured
if
the
alternative
was
the
hurting
of
feelings
i
think
i
chosen
a
pretty
likely
spot
to
hang
the
thing
what
said
archie
cheerfully
it
looks
well
alongside
those
japanese
prints
you
think
sort
of
stands
brewster
licked
his
dry
lips
and
grinned
a
ghastly
grin
it
does
stand
out
he
agreed
chapter
xxvi
a
tale
of
a
grandfather
archie
was
not
a
man
who
readily
allowed
himself
to
become
worried
especially
about
people
who
were
not
in
his
own
immediate
circle
of
friends
but
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
he
was
not
altogether
easy
in
his
mind
about
his
mental
condition
he
had
read
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
sunday
papers
and
elsewhere
about
the
constant
strain
to
which
captains
of
industry
are
subjected
a
strain
which
sooner
or
later
is
only
too
apt
to
make
the
victim
go
all
blooey
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
brewster
was
beginning
to
find
the
going
a
trifle
too
tough
for
his
stamina
undeniably
he
was
behaving
in
an
odd
manner
and
archie
though
no
physician
was
aware
that
when
the
american
that
restless
human
machine
starts
behaving
in
an
odd
manner
the
next
thing
you
know
is
that
two
strong
men
one
attached
to
each
arm
are
hurrying
him
into
the
cab
bound
for
bloomingdale
he
did
not
confide
his
misgivings
to
lucille
not
wishing
to
cause
her
anxiety
he
hunted
up
reggie
van
tuyl
at
the
club
and
sought
advice
from
him
i
say
reggie
old
thing
present
company
excepted
have
there
been
any
loonies
in
your
family
reggie
stirred
in
the
slumber
which
always
gripped
him
in
the
early
afternoon
loonies
he
mumbled
sleepily
rather
my
uncle
edgar
thought
he
was
twins
eh
yes
silly
idea
i
mean
you
have
thought
one
of
my
uncle
edgar
would
have
been
enough
for
any
how
did
the
thing
start
asked
archie
start
well
the
first
thing
we
noticed
was
when
he
began
wanting
two
of
everything
had
to
set
two
places
for
him
at
dinner
and
so
on
always
wanted
two
seats
at
the
theatre
ran
into
money
i
can
tell
he
did
behave
rummily
up
till
then
i
mean
to
say
was
sort
of
jumpy
and
all
that
not
that
i
remember
why
archie
tone
became
grave
well
i
tell
you
old
man
though
i
do
want
it
to
go
any
farther
that
i
a
bit
worried
about
my
jolly
old
i
believe
about
to
go
in
off
the
i
think
he
cracking
under
the
strain
dashed
weird
his
behaviour
has
been
the
last
few
such
as
murmured
van
tuyl
well
the
other
morning
i
happened
to
be
in
his
suite
incidentally
he
would
go
above
ten
dollars
and
i
wanted
he
suddenly
picked
up
a
whacking
big
and
bunged
it
for
all
he
was
at
you
not
at
me
that
was
the
rummy
part
of
it
at
a
mosquito
on
the
wall
he
said
well
i
mean
to
say
do
chappies
bung
at
mosquitoes
i
mean
is
it
done
smash
anything
curiously
enough
no
but
he
only
just
missed
a
rather
decent
picture
which
lucille
had
given
him
for
his
birthday
another
foot
to
the
left
and
it
would
have
been
a
sounds
and
talking
of
that
picture
i
looked
in
on
him
about
a
couple
of
afternoons
later
and
he
taken
it
down
from
the
wall
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
and
was
staring
at
it
in
a
dashed
marked
sort
of
manner
that
was
peculiar
what
on
the
floor
on
the
jolly
old
carpet
when
i
came
in
he
was
goggling
at
it
in
a
sort
of
glassy
way
absolutely
rapt
do
you
know
my
coming
in
gave
him
a
start
seemed
to
rouse
him
from
a
kind
of
trance
you
know
and
he
jumped
like
an
antelope
and
if
i
had
happened
to
grab
him
he
would
have
trampled
bang
on
the
thing
it
was
deuced
unpleasant
you
know
his
manner
was
rummy
he
seemed
to
be
brooding
on
something
what
ought
i
to
do
about
it
do
you
think
it
not
my
affair
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
goes
on
like
this
one
of
these
days
he
be
stabbing
someone
with
a
to
archie
relief
his
symptoms
showed
no
signs
of
development
in
fact
his
manner
reverted
to
the
normal
once
more
and
a
few
days
later
meeting
archie
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
he
seemed
quite
cheerful
it
was
not
often
that
he
wasted
his
time
talking
to
his
but
on
this
occasion
he
chatted
with
him
for
several
minutes
about
the
big
which
had
formed
the
chief
item
of
news
on
the
front
pages
of
the
morning
papers
that
day
it
was
opinion
that
the
outrage
had
been
the
work
of
a
gang
and
that
nobody
was
safe
daniel
brewster
had
spoken
of
this
matter
with
strange
earnestness
but
his
words
had
slipped
from
archie
mind
when
he
made
his
way
that
night
to
his
suite
archie
was
in
an
exalted
mood
in
the
course
of
dinner
he
had
had
a
bit
of
good
news
which
was
occupying
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
matters
it
had
left
him
in
a
comfortable
if
rather
dizzy
condition
of
benevolence
to
all
created
things
he
had
smiled
at
the
as
he
crossed
the
lobby
and
if
he
had
had
a
dollar
he
would
have
given
it
to
the
boy
who
took
him
up
in
the
elevator
he
found
the
door
of
the
brewster
suite
unlocked
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
struck
him
as
unusual
but
he
was
in
no
frame
of
mind
to
notice
these
trivialities
he
went
in
and
finding
the
room
dark
and
no
one
at
home
sat
down
too
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
to
switch
on
the
lights
and
gave
himself
up
to
dreamy
meditation
there
are
certain
moods
in
which
one
loses
count
of
time
and
archie
could
not
have
said
how
long
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
deep
near
the
window
when
he
first
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
room
he
had
closed
his
eyes
the
better
to
meditate
so
had
not
seen
anyone
enter
nor
had
he
heard
the
door
open
the
first
intimation
he
had
that
somebody
had
come
in
was
when
some
hard
substance
knocked
against
some
other
hard
object
producing
a
sharp
sound
which
brought
him
back
to
earth
with
a
jerk
he
sat
up
silently
the
fact
that
the
room
was
still
in
darkness
made
it
obvious
that
something
nefarious
was
afoot
plainly
there
was
dirty
work
in
preparation
at
the
he
stared
into
the
blackness
and
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
it
was
presently
able
to
see
an
indistinct
form
bending
over
something
on
the
floor
the
sound
of
rather
stertorous
breathing
came
to
him
archie
had
many
defects
which
prevented
him
being
the
perfect
man
but
lack
of
courage
was
not
one
of
them
his
somewhat
rudimentary
intelligence
had
occasionally
led
his
superior
officers
during
the
war
to
thank
god
that
great
britain
had
a
navy
but
even
these
stern
critics
had
found
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
manner
in
which
he
bounded
over
the
top
some
of
us
are
thinkers
others
men
of
action
archie
was
a
man
of
action
and
he
was
out
of
his
chair
and
sailing
in
the
direction
of
the
back
of
the
intruder
neck
before
a
wiser
man
would
have
completed
his
plan
of
campaign
the
miscreant
collapsed
under
him
with
a
squashy
sound
like
the
wind
going
out
of
a
pair
of
bellows
and
archie
taking
a
firm
seat
on
his
spine
rubbed
the
other
face
in
the
carpet
and
awaited
the
progress
of
events
at
the
end
of
half
a
minute
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
the
dashing
swiftness
of
the
assault
had
apparently
had
the
effect
of
depriving
the
marauder
of
his
entire
stock
of
breath
he
was
gurgling
to
himself
in
a
pained
sort
of
way
and
making
no
effort
to
rise
archie
feeling
that
it
would
be
safe
to
get
up
and
switch
on
the
light
did
so
and
turning
after
completing
this
manoeuvre
was
greeted
by
the
spectacle
of
his
seated
on
the
floor
in
a
breathless
and
dishevelled
condition
blinking
at
the
sudden
illumination
on
the
carpet
beside
brewster
lay
a
long
knife
and
beside
the
knife
lay
the
handsomely
framed
masterpiece
of
j
wheeler
fiancee
miss
alice
wigmore
archie
stared
at
this
collection
dumbly
oh
he
observed
at
length
feebly
a
distinct
chill
manifested
itself
in
the
region
of
archie
spine
this
could
mean
only
one
thing
his
fears
had
been
realised
the
strain
of
modern
life
with
all
its
hustle
and
excitement
had
at
last
proved
too
much
for
brewster
crushed
by
the
thousand
and
one
anxieties
and
worries
of
a
millionaire
existence
daniel
brewster
had
gone
off
his
onion
archie
was
nonplussed
this
was
his
first
experience
of
this
kind
of
thing
what
he
asked
himself
was
the
proper
procedure
in
a
situation
of
this
sort
what
was
the
local
rule
where
in
a
word
did
he
go
from
here
he
was
still
musing
in
an
embarrassed
and
baffled
way
having
taken
the
precaution
of
kicking
the
knife
under
the
sofa
when
brewster
spoke
and
there
was
in
both
the
words
and
the
method
of
their
delivery
so
much
of
his
old
familiar
self
that
archie
felt
quite
relieved
so
it
you
is
it
you
wretched
blight
you
miserable
weed
said
brewster
having
recovered
enough
breath
to
be
going
on
with
he
glowered
at
his
despondently
i
might
have
expected
it
if
i
was
at
the
north
pole
i
could
count
on
you
butting
in
shall
i
get
you
a
drink
of
water
said
archie
what
the
devil
demanded
brewster
do
you
imagine
i
want
with
a
drink
of
water
well
archie
hesitated
delicately
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
you
had
been
feeling
the
strain
a
bit
i
mean
to
say
rush
of
modern
life
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
said
brewster
changing
the
subject
well
i
came
to
tell
you
something
and
i
came
in
here
and
was
waiting
for
you
and
i
saw
some
chappie
biffing
about
in
the
dark
and
i
thought
it
was
a
burglar
or
something
after
some
of
your
things
so
thinking
it
over
i
got
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
fairly
juicy
scheme
to
land
on
him
with
both
feet
no
idea
it
was
you
old
thing
frightfully
sorry
and
all
that
meant
well
brewster
sighed
deeply
he
was
a
just
man
and
he
could
not
but
realise
that
in
the
circumstances
archie
had
behaved
not
unnaturally
oh
well
he
said
i
might
have
known
something
would
go
awfully
sorry
it
ca
be
helped
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
tell
me
he
eyed
his
piercingly
not
a
cent
over
twenty
dollars
he
said
coldly
archie
hastened
to
dispel
the
pardonable
error
oh
it
was
anything
like
that
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it
a
good
egg
it
has
bucked
me
up
to
no
inconsiderable
degree
i
was
dining
with
lucille
just
now
and
as
we
dallied
with
the
she
told
me
something
which
well
i
bound
to
say
it
made
me
feel
considerably
braced
she
told
me
to
trot
along
and
ask
you
if
you
would
mind
i
gave
lucille
a
hundred
dollars
only
last
archie
was
pained
adjust
this
sordid
outlook
old
thing
he
urged
you
simply
anywhere
near
it
right
off
the
target
absolutely
what
lucille
told
me
to
ask
you
was
if
you
would
mind
at
some
tolerably
near
date
being
a
grandfather
rotten
thing
to
be
of
course
proceeded
archie
commiseratingly
for
a
chappie
of
your
age
but
there
it
is
brewster
gulped
do
you
mean
to
say
i
mean
apt
to
make
a
fellow
feel
a
bit
of
a
patriarch
snowy
hair
and
what
not
and
of
course
for
a
chappie
in
the
prime
of
life
like
you
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
is
this
true
absolutely
of
course
speaking
for
myself
i
all
for
it
i
know
when
i
felt
more
bucked
i
sang
as
i
came
up
here
absolutely
warbled
in
the
elevator
but
you
a
curious
change
had
come
over
brewster
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
the
appearance
of
having
been
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
but
now
in
some
indescribable
way
he
seemed
to
have
melted
for
a
moment
he
gazed
at
archie
then
moving
quickly
forward
he
grasped
his
hand
in
an
iron
grip
this
is
the
best
news
i
ever
had
he
mumbled
awfully
good
of
you
to
take
it
like
this
said
archie
cordially
i
mean
being
a
grandfather
brewster
smiled
of
a
man
of
his
appearance
one
could
hardly
say
that
he
smiled
playfully
but
there
was
something
in
his
expression
that
remotely
suggested
playfulness
my
dear
old
bean
he
said
archie
started
my
dear
old
bean
repeated
brewster
firmly
i
the
happiest
man
in
america
his
eye
fell
on
the
picture
which
lay
on
the
floor
he
gave
a
slight
shudder
but
recovered
himself
immediately
after
this
he
said
i
can
reconcile
myself
to
living
with
that
thing
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
feel
it
does
i
say
said
archie
how
about
that
would
have
brought
the
thing
up
if
you
had
introduced
the
topic
but
speaking
as
man
to
man
what
the
dickens
were
you
up
to
when
i
landed
on
your
spine
just
now
i
suppose
you
thought
i
had
gone
off
my
head
well
i
bound
to
say
brewster
cast
an
unfriendly
glance
at
the
picture
well
i
had
every
excuse
after
living
with
that
infernal
thing
for
a
week
archie
looked
at
him
astonished
i
say
old
thing
i
do
know
if
i
have
got
your
meaning
exactly
but
you
somehow
give
me
the
impression
that
you
do
like
that
jolly
old
work
of
like
it
cried
brewster
it
nearly
driven
me
mad
every
time
it
caught
my
eye
it
gave
me
a
pain
in
the
neck
i
felt
as
if
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
did
want
to
hurt
lucille
feelings
by
telling
her
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
cut
the
damned
thing
out
of
its
frame
and
tell
her
it
had
been
what
an
extraordinary
thing
why
that
exactly
what
old
wheeler
who
is
old
wheeler
artist
chappie
pal
of
mine
his
fiancee
painted
the
thing
and
when
i
lifted
it
off
him
he
told
her
it
had
been
stolen
he
did
seem
frightfully
keen
on
it
your
friend
wheeler
has
evidently
good
archie
was
thinking
well
all
this
rather
gets
past
me
he
said
personally
i
always
admired
the
thing
dashed
ripe
bit
of
work
i
always
considered
still
of
course
if
you
feel
that
way
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
i
do
well
then
in
that
case
you
know
what
a
clumsy
devil
i
am
you
can
tell
lucille
it
was
all
my
fault
the
wigmore
venus
smiled
up
at
archie
it
seemed
to
archie
with
a
pathetic
pleading
smile
for
a
moment
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
guilt
then
closing
his
eyes
and
hardening
his
heart
he
sprang
lightly
in
the
air
and
descended
with
both
feet
on
the
picture
there
was
a
sound
of
rending
canvas
and
the
venus
ceased
to
smile
golly
said
archie
regarding
the
wreckage
remorsefully
brewster
did
not
share
his
remorse
for
the
second
time
that
night
he
gripped
him
by
the
hand
my
boy
he
quavered
he
stared
at
archie
as
if
he
were
seeing
him
with
new
eyes
my
dear
boy
you
were
through
the
war
were
you
not
eh
oh
yes
right
through
the
jolly
old
what
was
your
rank
oh
second
you
ought
to
have
been
a
general
brewster
clasped
his
hand
once
more
in
a
vigorous
embrace
i
only
hope
he
added
that
your
son
will
be
like
you
there
are
certain
compliments
or
compliments
coming
from
certain
sources
before
which
modesty
reels
stunned
archie
did
he
swallowed
convulsively
he
had
never
thought
to
hear
these
words
from
daniel
brewster
how
would
it
be
old
thing
he
said
almost
brokenly
if
you
and
i
trickled
down
to
the
bar
and
had
a
spot
of
sherbet
the
end
