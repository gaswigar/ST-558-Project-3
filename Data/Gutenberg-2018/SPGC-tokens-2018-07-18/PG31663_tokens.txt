anything
is
possible
and
now
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
by
lafferty
illustrated
by
gaughan
he
began
by
breaking
things
that
morning
he
broke
the
glass
of
water
on
his
night
stand
he
knocked
it
crazily
against
the
opposite
wall
and
shattered
it
yet
it
shattered
slowly
this
would
have
surprised
him
if
he
had
been
fully
awake
for
he
had
only
reached
out
sleepily
for
it
nor
had
he
wakened
regularly
to
his
alarm
he
had
wakened
to
a
weird
slow
low
booming
yet
the
clock
said
six
time
for
the
alarm
and
the
low
boom
when
it
came
again
seemed
to
come
from
the
clock
he
reached
out
and
touched
it
gently
but
it
floated
off
the
stand
at
his
touch
and
bounced
around
slowly
on
the
floor
and
when
he
picked
it
up
again
it
had
stopped
nor
would
shaking
start
it
he
checked
the
electric
clock
in
the
kitchen
this
also
said
six
but
the
sweep
hand
did
not
move
in
his
living
room
the
radio
clock
said
six
but
the
second
hand
seemed
stationary
but
the
lights
in
both
rooms
work
said
vincent
how
are
the
clocks
stopped
are
they
on
a
separate
circuit
he
went
back
to
his
bedroom
and
got
his
wristwatch
it
also
said
six
and
its
sweep
hand
did
not
sweep
now
this
could
get
silly
what
is
it
that
would
stop
both
mechanical
and
electrical
clocks
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
clock
on
the
mutual
insurance
building
it
said
six
and
the
second
hand
did
not
move
well
it
is
possible
that
the
confusion
is
not
limited
to
myself
i
once
heard
the
fanciful
theory
that
a
cold
shower
will
clear
the
mind
for
me
it
never
has
but
i
will
try
it
i
can
always
use
cleanliness
for
an
excuse
the
shower
did
work
yes
it
did
the
water
came
now
but
not
like
water
like
very
slow
syrup
that
hung
in
the
air
he
reached
up
to
touch
it
there
hanging
down
and
stretching
and
it
shattered
like
glass
when
he
touched
it
and
drifted
in
fantastic
slow
globs
across
the
room
but
it
had
the
feel
of
water
wet
and
pleasantly
cool
and
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
or
so
it
was
down
over
his
shoulders
and
back
and
he
luxuriated
in
it
he
let
it
soak
his
head
and
it
cleared
his
wits
at
once
there
is
not
a
thing
wrong
with
me
i
am
fine
it
is
not
my
fault
that
the
water
is
slow
this
morning
and
other
things
awry
he
reached
for
the
towel
and
it
tore
to
pieces
in
his
hands
like
porous
wet
paper
now
he
became
very
careful
in
the
way
he
handled
things
slowly
tenderly
and
deftly
he
took
them
so
that
they
would
not
break
he
shaved
himself
without
mishap
in
spite
of
the
slow
water
in
the
lavatory
also
then
he
dressed
himself
with
the
greatest
caution
and
cunning
breaking
nothing
except
his
shoe
laces
a
thing
that
is
likely
to
happen
at
any
time
if
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
then
i
will
check
and
see
if
there
is
anything
seriously
wrong
with
the
world
the
dawn
was
fairly
along
when
i
looked
out
as
it
should
have
been
approximately
twenty
minutes
have
passed
it
is
a
clear
morning
the
sun
should
now
have
hit
the
top
several
stories
of
the
insurance
building
but
it
had
not
it
was
a
clear
morning
but
the
dawn
had
not
brightened
at
all
in
the
twenty
minutes
and
that
big
clock
still
said
six
it
had
not
changed
yet
it
had
changed
and
he
knew
it
with
a
queer
feeling
he
pictured
it
as
it
had
been
before
the
hour
and
the
minute
hand
had
not
moved
noticeably
but
the
second
hand
had
moved
it
had
moved
a
third
of
the
dial
so
he
pulled
up
a
chair
to
the
window
and
watched
it
he
realized
that
though
he
could
not
see
it
move
yet
it
did
make
progress
he
watched
it
for
perhaps
five
minutes
it
moved
through
a
space
of
perhaps
five
seconds
well
that
is
not
my
problem
it
is
that
of
the
clock
maker
either
a
terrestrial
or
a
celestial
one
but
he
left
his
rooms
without
a
good
breakfast
and
he
left
them
very
early
how
did
he
know
that
it
was
early
since
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
time
well
it
was
early
at
least
according
to
the
sun
and
according
to
the
clocks
neither
of
which
institutions
seemed
to
be
working
properly
he
left
without
a
good
breakfast
because
the
coffee
would
not
make
and
the
bacon
would
not
fry
and
in
plain
point
of
fact
the
fire
would
not
heat
the
gas
flame
came
from
the
pilot
light
like
a
slowly
spreading
stream
or
an
unfolding
flower
then
it
burned
far
too
steadily
the
skillet
remained
cold
when
placed
over
it
nor
would
water
even
heat
it
had
taken
at
least
five
minutes
to
get
the
water
out
of
the
faucet
in
the
first
place
he
ate
a
few
pieces
of
leftover
bread
and
some
scraps
of
meat
in
the
street
there
was
no
motion
no
real
motion
a
truck
first
seeming
at
rest
moved
very
slowly
there
was
no
gear
in
which
it
could
move
so
slowly
and
there
was
a
taxi
which
crept
along
but
charles
vincent
had
to
look
at
it
carefully
for
some
time
to
be
sure
that
it
was
in
motion
then
he
received
a
shock
he
realized
by
the
early
morning
light
that
the
driver
of
it
was
dead
dead
with
his
eyes
wide
open
slowly
as
it
was
going
and
by
whatever
means
it
was
moving
it
should
really
be
stopped
he
walked
over
to
it
opened
the
door
and
pulled
on
the
brake
then
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
dead
man
was
he
really
dead
it
was
hard
to
be
sure
he
felt
warm
but
even
as
vincent
looked
the
eyes
of
the
dead
man
had
begun
to
close
and
close
they
did
and
open
again
in
a
matter
of
about
twenty
seconds
this
was
weird
the
slowly
closing
and
opening
eyes
sent
a
chill
through
vincent
and
the
dead
man
had
begun
to
lean
forward
in
his
seat
vincent
put
a
hand
in
the
middle
of
the
man
chest
to
hold
him
upright
but
he
found
the
forward
pressure
as
relentless
as
it
was
slow
he
was
unable
to
keep
the
dead
man
up
so
he
let
him
go
watching
curiously
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
driver
face
was
against
the
wheel
but
it
was
almost
as
if
it
had
no
intention
of
stopping
there
it
pressed
into
the
wheel
with
dogged
force
he
would
surely
break
his
face
vincent
took
several
holds
on
the
dead
man
and
counteracted
the
pressure
somewhat
yet
the
face
was
being
damaged
and
if
things
were
normal
blood
would
have
flowed
the
man
had
been
dead
so
long
however
that
though
he
was
still
warm
his
blood
must
have
congealed
for
it
was
fully
two
minutes
before
it
began
to
ooze
whatever
i
have
done
i
have
done
enough
damage
said
vincent
and
in
whatever
nightmare
i
am
in
i
am
likely
to
do
further
harm
if
i
meddle
more
i
had
better
leave
it
alone
he
walked
on
down
the
morning
street
yet
whatever
vehicles
he
saw
were
moving
with
an
incredible
slowness
as
though
driven
by
some
fantastic
gear
reduction
and
there
were
people
here
and
there
frozen
solid
it
was
a
chilly
morning
but
it
was
not
that
cold
they
were
immobile
in
positions
of
motion
as
though
they
were
playing
the
children
game
of
statues
how
is
it
said
charles
vincent
that
this
young
girl
who
i
believe
works
across
the
street
from
us
should
have
died
standing
up
and
in
full
stride
but
no
she
is
not
dead
or
if
so
she
died
with
a
very
alert
expression
and
oh
my
god
doing
it
too
for
he
realized
that
the
eyes
of
the
girl
were
closing
and
in
the
space
of
no
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
second
they
had
completed
their
cycle
and
were
open
again
also
and
this
was
even
stranger
she
had
moved
moved
forward
in
full
stride
he
would
have
timed
her
if
he
could
but
how
could
he
when
all
the
clocks
were
crazy
yet
she
must
have
been
taking
about
two
steps
a
minute
he
went
into
the
cafeteria
the
early
morning
crowd
that
he
had
often
watched
through
the
windows
was
there
the
girl
who
made
flapjacks
in
the
window
had
just
flipped
one
and
it
hung
in
the
air
then
it
floated
over
as
if
caught
by
a
slight
breeze
and
sank
slowly
down
as
if
settling
in
water
the
breakfasters
like
the
people
in
the
street
were
all
dead
in
this
new
way
moving
with
almost
imperceptible
motion
and
all
had
apparently
died
in
the
act
of
drinking
coffee
eating
eggs
or
munching
toast
and
if
there
were
only
time
enough
there
was
even
a
chance
that
they
would
get
the
drinking
eating
and
munching
done
with
for
there
was
the
shadow
of
movement
in
them
all
the
cashier
had
the
register
drawer
open
and
money
in
her
hand
and
the
hand
of
the
customer
was
outstretched
for
it
in
time
somewhere
in
the
new
leisurely
time
the
hands
would
come
together
and
the
change
be
given
and
so
it
happened
it
may
have
been
a
minute
and
a
half
or
two
minutes
or
two
and
a
half
it
is
always
hard
to
judge
time
and
now
it
had
become
all
but
impossible
i
am
still
hungry
said
charles
vincent
but
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
wait
for
service
here
should
i
help
myself
they
will
not
mind
if
they
are
dead
and
if
they
are
not
dead
in
any
case
it
seems
that
i
am
invisible
to
them
he
wolfed
several
rolls
he
opened
a
bottle
of
milk
and
held
it
upside
down
over
his
glass
while
he
ate
another
roll
liquids
had
all
become
perversely
slow
but
he
felt
better
for
his
erratic
breakfast
he
would
have
paid
for
it
but
how
he
left
the
cafeteria
and
walked
about
the
town
as
it
seemed
still
to
be
quite
early
though
one
could
depend
on
neither
sun
nor
clock
for
the
time
any
more
the
traffic
lights
were
unchanging
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
a
little
park
and
watched
the
town
and
the
big
clock
in
the
commerce
building
tower
but
like
all
the
clocks
it
was
either
stopped
or
the
hand
would
creep
too
slowly
to
be
seen
it
must
have
been
just
about
an
hour
till
the
traffic
lights
changed
but
change
they
did
at
last
by
picking
a
point
on
the
building
across
the
street
and
watching
what
moved
past
it
he
found
that
the
traffic
did
indeed
move
in
a
minute
or
so
the
entire
length
of
a
car
would
pass
the
given
point
he
had
he
recalled
been
very
far
behind
in
his
work
and
it
had
been
worrying
him
he
decided
to
go
to
the
office
early
as
it
was
or
seemed
to
be
he
let
himself
in
nobody
else
was
there
he
resolved
not
to
look
at
the
clock
and
to
be
very
careful
of
the
way
he
handled
all
objects
because
of
his
new
propensity
for
breaking
things
this
considered
all
seemed
normal
there
he
had
said
the
day
before
that
he
could
hardly
catch
up
on
his
work
if
he
put
in
two
days
solid
he
now
resolved
at
least
to
work
steadily
until
something
happened
whatever
it
was
for
hour
after
hour
he
worked
on
his
tabulations
and
reports
nobody
else
had
arrived
could
something
be
wrong
certainly
something
was
wrong
but
this
was
not
a
holiday
that
was
not
it
just
how
long
can
a
stubborn
and
mystified
man
plug
away
at
his
task
it
was
hour
after
hour
after
hour
he
did
not
become
hungry
nor
particularly
tired
and
he
did
get
through
a
lot
of
work
it
must
be
half
done
however
it
has
happened
i
have
caught
up
on
at
least
a
day
work
i
will
keep
on
he
must
have
continued
silently
for
another
eight
or
ten
hours
he
was
caught
up
completely
on
his
back
work
well
to
some
extent
i
can
work
into
the
future
i
can
head
up
and
carry
over
i
can
put
in
everything
but
the
figures
of
the
field
reports
and
he
did
so
it
will
be
hard
to
bury
me
in
work
again
i
could
almost
coast
for
a
day
i
do
even
know
what
day
it
is
but
i
must
have
worked
twenty
hours
straight
through
and
nobody
has
arrived
perhaps
nobody
ever
will
arrive
if
they
are
moving
with
the
speed
of
the
people
in
the
nightmare
outside
it
is
no
wonder
they
have
not
arrived
he
put
his
head
down
on
his
arms
on
the
desk
the
last
thing
he
saw
before
he
closed
his
eyes
was
the
misshapen
left
thumb
that
he
had
always
tried
to
conceal
a
little
by
the
way
he
handled
his
hands
at
least
i
know
that
i
am
still
myself
i
know
myself
anywhere
by
that
then
he
went
to
sleep
at
his
desk
jenny
came
in
with
a
quick
of
high
heels
and
he
wakened
to
the
noise
what
are
you
doing
dozing
at
your
desk
vincent
have
you
been
here
all
night
i
do
know
jenny
honestly
i
do
i
was
only
teasing
sometimes
when
i
get
here
a
little
early
i
take
a
catnap
myself
the
clock
said
six
minutes
till
eight
and
the
second
hand
was
sweeping
normally
time
had
returned
to
the
world
or
to
him
but
had
all
that
early
morning
of
his
been
a
dream
then
it
had
been
a
very
efficient
dream
he
had
accomplished
work
that
he
could
hardly
have
done
in
two
days
and
it
was
the
same
day
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
he
went
to
the
water
fountain
the
water
now
behaved
normally
he
went
to
the
window
the
traffic
was
behaving
as
it
should
though
sometimes
slow
and
sometimes
snarled
yet
it
was
in
the
pace
of
the
regular
world
the
other
workers
arrived
they
were
not
balls
of
fire
but
neither
was
it
necessary
to
observe
them
for
several
minutes
to
be
sure
they
were
dead
it
did
have
its
advantages
charles
vincent
said
i
would
be
afraid
to
live
with
it
permanently
but
it
would
be
handy
to
go
into
for
a
few
minutes
a
day
and
accomplish
the
business
of
hours
i
may
be
a
case
for
the
doctor
but
just
how
would
i
go
about
telling
a
doctor
what
was
bothering
me
now
it
had
surely
been
less
than
two
hours
from
his
first
rising
till
the
time
that
he
wakened
to
the
noise
of
jenny
from
his
second
sleep
and
how
long
that
second
sleep
had
been
or
in
which
time
enclave
he
had
no
idea
but
how
account
for
it
all
he
had
spent
a
long
while
in
his
own
rooms
much
longer
than
ordinary
in
his
confusion
he
had
walked
the
city
mile
after
mile
in
his
puzzlement
and
he
had
sat
in
the
little
park
for
hours
and
studied
the
situation
and
he
had
worked
at
his
own
desk
for
an
outlandish
long
time
well
he
would
go
to
the
doctor
a
man
is
obliged
to
refrain
from
making
a
fool
of
himself
to
the
world
at
large
but
to
his
own
lawyer
his
priest
or
his
doctor
he
will
sometimes
have
to
come
as
a
fool
by
their
callings
they
are
restrained
from
scoffing
openly
mason
was
not
particularly
a
friend
charles
vincent
realized
with
some
unease
that
he
did
not
have
any
particular
friends
only
acquaintances
and
associates
it
was
as
though
he
were
of
a
species
slightly
apart
from
his
fellows
he
wished
now
a
little
that
he
had
a
particular
friend
but
mason
was
an
acquaintance
of
some
years
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
doctor
and
besides
vincent
had
now
arrived
at
his
office
and
been
shown
in
he
would
either
have
to
well
that
was
as
good
a
beginning
as
any
doctor
i
am
in
a
predicament
i
will
either
have
to
invent
some
symptoms
to
account
for
my
visit
here
or
make
an
excuse
and
bolt
or
tell
you
what
is
bothering
me
even
though
you
will
think
i
am
a
new
sort
of
idiot
vincent
every
day
people
invent
symptoms
to
cover
their
visits
here
and
i
know
that
they
have
lost
their
nerve
about
the
real
reason
for
coming
and
every
day
people
do
make
excuses
and
bolt
but
experience
tells
me
that
i
will
get
a
larger
fee
if
you
tackle
the
third
alternative
and
vincent
there
is
no
new
sort
of
idiot
vincent
said
it
may
not
sound
so
silly
if
i
tell
it
quickly
i
awoke
this
morning
to
some
very
puzzling
incidents
it
seemed
that
time
itself
had
stopped
or
that
the
whole
world
had
gone
into
motion
the
water
would
neither
flow
nor
boil
and
fire
would
not
heat
food
the
clocks
which
i
first
believed
had
stopped
crept
along
at
perhaps
a
minute
an
hour
the
people
i
met
in
the
streets
appeared
dead
frozen
in
lifelike
attitudes
and
it
was
only
by
watching
them
for
a
very
long
time
that
i
perceived
that
they
did
indeed
have
motion
one
car
i
saw
creeping
slower
than
the
most
backward
snail
and
a
dead
man
at
the
wheel
of
it
i
went
to
it
opened
the
door
and
put
on
the
brake
i
realized
after
a
time
that
the
man
was
not
dead
but
he
bent
forward
and
broke
his
face
on
the
steering
wheel
it
must
have
taken
a
full
minute
for
his
head
to
travel
no
more
than
ten
inches
yet
i
was
unable
to
prevent
his
hitting
the
wheel
i
then
did
other
bizarre
things
in
a
world
that
had
died
on
its
feet
i
walked
many
miles
through
the
city
and
then
i
sat
for
hours
in
the
park
i
went
to
the
office
and
let
myself
in
i
accomplished
work
that
must
have
taken
me
twenty
hours
i
then
took
a
nap
at
my
desk
when
i
awoke
on
the
arrival
of
the
others
it
was
six
minutes
to
eight
in
the
morning
of
the
same
day
today
not
two
hours
had
passed
from
my
rising
and
time
was
back
to
normal
but
the
things
that
happened
in
that
time
that
could
never
be
compressed
into
two
hours
one
question
first
vincent
did
you
actually
accomplish
the
work
of
many
hours
i
did
it
was
done
and
done
in
that
time
it
did
not
become
undone
on
the
return
of
time
to
normal
a
second
question
had
you
been
worried
about
your
work
about
being
behind
yes
emphatically
then
here
is
one
explanation
you
retired
last
night
but
very
shortly
afterward
you
arose
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
there
are
facets
of
sleepwalking
which
we
do
not
at
all
understand
the
interludes
were
parts
of
a
walking
dream
of
yours
you
dressed
and
went
to
your
office
and
worked
all
night
it
is
possible
to
do
routine
tasks
in
a
somnambulistic
state
rapidly
and
even
feverishly
with
an
intense
concentration
to
perform
prodigies
you
may
have
fallen
into
a
normal
sleep
there
when
you
had
finished
or
you
may
have
been
awakened
directly
from
your
somnambulistic
trance
on
the
arrival
of
your
there
that
is
a
plausible
and
workable
explanation
in
the
case
of
an
apparently
bizarre
happening
it
is
always
well
to
have
a
rational
explanation
to
fall
back
on
they
will
usually
satisfy
a
patient
and
put
his
mind
at
rest
but
often
they
do
not
satisfy
me
your
explanation
very
nearly
satisfies
me
mason
and
it
does
put
my
mind
considerably
at
rest
i
am
sure
that
in
a
short
while
i
will
be
able
to
accept
it
completely
but
why
does
it
not
satisfy
you
one
reason
is
a
man
i
treated
early
this
morning
he
had
his
face
smashed
and
he
had
seen
or
almost
seen
a
ghost
a
ghost
of
incredible
swiftness
that
was
more
sensed
than
seen
the
ghost
opened
the
door
of
his
car
while
it
was
going
at
full
speed
jerked
on
the
brake
and
caused
him
to
crack
his
head
this
man
was
dazed
and
had
a
slight
concussion
i
have
convinced
him
that
he
did
not
see
any
ghost
at
all
that
he
must
have
dozed
at
the
wheel
and
run
into
something
as
i
say
i
am
harder
to
convince
than
my
patients
but
it
may
have
been
coincidence
i
hope
so
but
you
also
seem
to
have
another
reservation
after
quite
a
few
years
in
practice
i
seldom
see
or
hear
anything
new
twice
before
i
have
been
told
a
happening
or
a
dream
on
the
line
of
what
you
experienced
did
you
convince
your
patients
that
it
was
only
a
dream
i
did
both
of
them
that
is
i
convinced
them
the
first
few
times
it
happened
to
them
were
they
satisfied
at
first
later
not
entirely
but
they
both
died
within
a
year
of
their
first
coming
to
me
nothing
violent
i
hope
both
had
the
gentlest
deaths
that
of
senility
extreme
oh
well
i
too
young
for
that
i
would
like
you
to
come
back
in
a
month
or
so
i
will
if
the
delusion
or
the
dream
returns
or
if
i
do
not
feel
well
after
this
charles
vincent
began
to
forget
about
the
incident
he
only
recalled
it
with
humor
sometimes
when
again
he
was
behind
in
his
work
well
if
it
gets
bad
enough
i
may
do
another
sleepwalking
act
and
catch
up
but
if
there
is
another
aspect
of
time
and
i
could
enter
it
at
will
it
might
often
be
handy
charles
vincent
never
saw
his
face
at
all
it
is
very
dark
in
some
of
those
clubs
and
the
coq
bleu
is
like
the
inside
of
a
tomb
he
went
to
the
clubs
only
about
once
a
month
sometimes
after
a
show
when
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
to
bed
sometimes
when
he
was
just
plain
restless
citizens
of
the
more
fortunate
states
may
not
know
of
the
mysteries
of
the
clubs
in
vincent
the
only
bars
are
beer
bars
and
only
in
the
clubs
can
a
person
get
a
drink
and
only
members
are
admitted
it
is
true
that
even
such
a
small
club
as
the
coq
bleu
had
thirty
thousand
members
and
at
a
dollar
a
year
that
is
a
nice
sideline
the
little
numbered
membership
cards
cost
a
penny
each
for
the
printing
and
the
member
wrote
in
his
own
name
but
he
had
to
have
a
card
or
a
dollar
for
a
card
to
gain
admittance
but
there
could
be
no
entertainments
in
the
clubs
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
little
bar
room
in
the
near
darkness
the
man
was
there
and
then
he
was
not
and
then
he
was
there
again
and
always
where
he
sat
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
i
wonder
he
said
to
vincent
or
to
the
bar
at
large
though
there
were
no
other
customers
and
the
bartender
was
asleep
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
read
zurbarin
on
the
relationship
of
extradigitalism
to
genius
i
have
never
heard
of
the
work
nor
of
the
man
said
vincent
i
doubt
if
either
exists
i
am
zurbarin
said
the
man
vincent
hid
his
misshapen
left
thumb
yet
it
could
not
have
been
noticed
in
that
light
and
he
must
have
been
crazy
to
believe
there
was
any
connection
between
it
and
the
man
remark
it
was
not
truly
a
double
thumb
he
was
not
an
extradigital
nor
was
he
a
genius
i
refuse
to
become
interested
in
you
said
vincent
i
am
on
the
verge
of
leaving
i
dislike
waking
the
bartender
but
i
did
want
another
drink
sooner
done
than
said
what
is
your
glass
is
full
it
is
so
it
is
is
it
a
trick
trick
is
the
name
for
anything
either
too
frivolous
or
too
mystifying
for
us
to
comprehend
but
on
one
long
early
morning
of
a
month
ago
you
also
could
have
done
the
trick
and
nearly
as
well
could
i
have
how
would
you
know
about
my
long
early
morning
assuming
there
to
have
been
such
i
watched
you
for
a
while
few
others
have
the
equipment
to
watch
you
with
when
you
in
the
aspect
so
they
were
silent
for
some
time
and
vincent
watched
the
clock
and
was
ready
to
go
i
wonder
said
the
man
in
the
dark
if
you
have
read
schimmelpenninck
on
the
sexagintal
and
the
duodecimal
in
the
chaldee
mysteries
i
have
not
and
i
doubt
if
anyone
else
has
i
would
guess
that
you
are
also
schimmelpenninck
and
that
you
have
just
made
up
the
name
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
am
schimm
it
is
true
but
i
made
up
the
name
on
the
spur
of
a
moment
many
years
ago
i
am
a
little
bored
with
you
said
vincent
but
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
do
your
trick
once
more
i
have
just
done
so
and
you
are
not
bored
you
are
frightened
of
what
asked
vincent
whose
glass
was
in
fact
full
again
of
reentering
a
dread
that
you
are
not
sure
was
a
dream
but
there
are
advantages
to
being
both
invisible
and
inaudible
can
you
be
invisible
was
i
not
when
i
went
behind
the
bar
just
now
and
fixed
you
a
drink
how
a
man
in
full
stride
goes
at
the
rate
of
about
five
miles
an
hour
multiply
that
by
sixty
which
is
the
number
of
time
when
i
leave
my
stool
and
go
behind
the
bar
i
go
and
return
at
the
rate
of
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
so
i
am
invisible
to
you
particularly
if
i
move
while
you
blink
one
thing
does
not
match
you
might
have
got
around
there
and
back
but
you
could
not
have
poured
shall
i
say
that
mastery
over
liquids
is
not
given
to
beginners
but
for
us
there
are
many
ways
to
outwit
the
slowness
of
matter
i
believe
that
you
are
a
hoaxer
do
you
know
dr
mason
i
know
that
you
went
to
see
him
i
know
of
his
futile
attempts
to
penetrate
a
certain
mystery
but
i
have
not
talked
to
him
of
you
i
still
believe
that
you
are
a
phony
could
you
put
me
back
into
the
state
of
my
dream
of
a
month
ago
it
was
not
a
dream
but
i
could
put
you
again
into
that
state
prove
it
watch
the
clock
do
you
believe
that
i
can
point
my
finger
at
it
and
stop
it
for
you
it
is
already
stopped
for
me
no
i
do
believe
it
yes
i
guess
i
have
to
since
i
see
that
you
have
just
done
it
but
it
may
be
another
trick
i
do
know
where
the
clock
is
plugged
in
neither
do
i
come
to
the
door
look
at
every
clock
you
can
see
are
they
not
all
stopped
yes
maybe
the
power
has
gone
off
all
over
town
you
know
it
has
not
there
are
still
lighted
windows
in
those
buildings
though
it
is
quite
late
why
are
you
playing
with
me
i
am
neither
on
the
inside
nor
the
outside
either
tell
me
the
secret
or
say
that
you
will
not
tell
me
the
secret
is
a
simple
one
it
can
only
be
arrived
at
after
all
philosophy
and
learning
have
been
assimilated
one
man
can
not
arrive
at
that
in
one
lifetime
not
in
an
ordinary
lifetime
but
the
secret
of
the
secret
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
is
that
one
must
use
part
of
it
as
a
tool
in
learning
you
could
not
learn
all
in
one
lifetime
but
by
being
permitted
the
first
step
to
be
able
to
read
say
sixty
books
in
the
time
it
took
you
to
read
one
to
pause
for
a
minute
in
thought
and
use
up
only
one
second
to
get
a
day
work
accomplished
in
eight
minutes
and
so
have
time
for
other
things
by
such
ways
one
may
make
a
beginning
i
will
warn
you
though
even
for
the
most
intelligent
it
is
a
race
a
race
what
race
it
is
a
race
between
success
which
is
life
and
failure
which
is
death
let
skip
the
melodrama
how
do
i
get
into
the
state
and
out
of
it
oh
that
is
simple
so
easy
that
it
seems
like
a
gadget
here
are
two
diagrams
i
will
draw
note
them
carefully
this
first
envision
it
in
your
mind
and
you
are
in
the
state
now
this
second
one
envision
and
you
are
out
of
it
that
easy
that
deceptively
easy
the
trick
is
to
learn
why
it
works
if
you
want
to
succeed
meaning
to
live
so
charles
vincent
left
him
and
went
home
walking
the
mile
in
a
little
less
than
fifteen
normal
seconds
but
he
still
had
not
seen
the
face
of
the
man
there
are
advantages
intellectual
monetary
and
amorous
in
being
able
to
enter
the
accelerated
state
at
will
it
is
a
fox
game
one
must
be
careful
not
to
be
caught
at
it
nor
to
break
or
harm
that
which
is
in
the
normal
state
vincent
could
always
find
eight
or
ten
minutes
unobserved
to
accomplish
the
day
work
and
a
coffee
break
could
turn
into
a
romp
around
the
town
there
was
this
boyish
pleasure
in
becoming
a
ghost
to
appear
and
stand
motionless
in
front
of
an
onrushing
train
and
to
cause
the
scream
of
the
whistle
and
to
be
in
no
danger
being
able
to
move
five
or
ten
times
as
fast
as
the
train
to
enter
and
to
sit
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
select
group
and
see
them
stare
and
then
disappear
from
the
middle
of
them
to
interfere
in
sports
and
games
entering
a
prize
ring
and
tripping
hampering
or
slugging
the
unliked
fighter
to
down
the
hockey
ice
skating
at
fifteen
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
scoring
dozens
of
goals
at
either
end
while
the
people
only
know
that
something
odd
is
happening
there
was
pleasure
in
being
able
to
shatter
windows
by
chanting
little
songs
for
the
voice
when
in
the
state
will
be
to
the
world
at
sixty
times
its
regular
pitch
though
normal
to
oneself
and
for
this
reason
also
he
was
inaudible
to
others
there
was
fun
in
petty
thieving
and
tricks
he
would
take
a
wallet
from
a
man
pocket
and
be
two
blocks
away
when
the
victim
turned
at
the
feel
he
would
come
back
and
stuff
it
into
the
man
mouth
as
he
bleated
to
a
policeman
he
would
come
into
the
home
of
a
lady
writing
a
letter
snatch
up
the
paper
and
write
three
lines
and
vanish
before
the
scream
got
out
of
her
throat
he
would
take
food
off
forks
put
baby
turtles
and
live
fish
into
bowls
of
soup
between
spoonfuls
of
the
eater
he
would
lash
the
hands
of
handshakers
tightly
together
with
stout
cord
he
unzippered
persons
of
both
sexes
when
they
were
at
their
most
pompous
he
changed
cards
from
one
player
hand
to
another
he
removed
golf
balls
from
tees
during
the
backswing
and
left
notes
written
large
you
missed
me
pinned
to
the
ground
with
the
tee
or
he
shaved
mustaches
and
heads
returning
repeatedly
to
one
woman
he
disliked
he
gradually
clipped
her
bald
and
finally
gilded
her
pate
with
tellers
counting
their
money
he
interfered
outrageously
and
enriched
himself
he
snipped
cigarettes
in
two
with
a
scissors
and
blew
out
matches
so
that
one
frustrated
man
broke
down
and
cried
at
his
inability
to
get
a
light
he
removed
the
weapons
from
the
holsters
of
policemen
and
put
cap
pistols
and
water
guns
in
their
places
he
unclipped
the
leashes
of
dogs
and
substituted
little
toy
dogs
rolling
on
wheels
he
put
frogs
in
water
glasses
and
left
lighted
firecrackers
on
bridge
tables
he
reset
wrist
watches
on
wrists
and
played
pranks
in
rooms
i
was
always
a
boy
at
heart
said
charles
vincent
also
during
those
first
few
days
of
the
controlled
new
state
he
established
himself
materially
acquiring
wealth
by
devious
ways
and
opening
bank
accounts
in
various
cities
under
various
names
against
a
time
of
possible
need
nor
did
he
ever
feel
any
shame
for
the
tricks
he
played
on
unaccelerated
humanity
for
the
people
when
he
was
in
the
state
were
as
statues
to
him
hardly
living
barely
moving
unseeing
unhearing
and
it
is
no
shame
to
show
disrespect
to
such
comical
statues
and
also
and
again
because
he
was
a
boy
at
heart
he
had
fun
with
the
girls
i
am
one
mass
of
black
and
blue
marks
said
jenny
one
day
my
lips
are
sore
and
my
front
teeth
feel
loosened
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
me
yet
he
had
not
meant
to
bruise
or
harm
her
he
was
rather
fond
of
her
and
he
resolved
to
be
much
more
careful
yet
it
was
fun
when
he
was
in
the
state
and
invisible
to
her
because
of
his
speed
to
kiss
her
here
and
there
in
places
she
made
a
nice
statue
and
it
was
good
sport
and
there
were
others
you
look
older
said
one
of
his
one
day
are
you
taking
care
of
yourself
are
you
worried
i
am
not
said
vincent
i
never
felt
better
or
happier
in
my
life
but
now
there
was
time
for
so
many
things
time
in
fact
for
everything
there
was
no
reason
why
he
could
not
master
anything
in
the
world
when
he
could
take
off
for
fifteen
minutes
and
gain
fifteen
hours
vincent
was
a
rapid
but
careful
reader
he
could
now
read
from
a
hundred
and
twenty
to
two
hundred
books
in
an
evening
and
night
and
he
slept
in
the
accelerated
state
and
could
get
a
full
night
sleep
in
eight
minutes
he
first
acquired
a
knowledge
of
languages
a
quite
extensive
reading
knowledge
of
a
language
can
be
acquired
in
three
hundred
hours
world
time
or
three
hundred
minutes
five
hours
accelerated
time
and
if
one
takes
the
tongues
in
order
from
the
most
familiar
to
the
most
remote
there
is
no
real
difficulty
he
acquired
fifty
for
a
starter
and
could
always
add
any
other
any
evening
that
he
found
he
had
a
need
for
it
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
assemble
and
consolidate
knowledge
of
literature
properly
speaking
there
are
no
more
than
ten
thousand
books
that
are
really
worth
reading
and
falling
in
love
with
these
were
gone
through
with
high
pleasure
and
two
or
three
thousand
of
them
were
important
enough
to
be
reserved
for
future
rereading
history
however
is
very
uneven
and
it
is
necessary
to
read
texts
and
sources
that
for
form
are
not
worth
reading
and
the
same
with
philosophy
mathematics
and
science
pure
or
physical
could
not
of
course
be
covered
with
the
same
speed
yet
with
time
available
all
could
be
mastered
there
is
no
concept
ever
expressed
by
any
human
mind
that
can
not
be
comprehended
by
any
other
normal
human
mind
if
time
is
available
and
it
is
taken
in
the
proper
order
and
context
and
with
the
proper
preparatory
work
and
often
and
now
more
often
vincent
felt
that
he
was
touching
the
fingers
of
the
secret
and
always
when
he
came
near
it
it
had
a
little
bit
the
smell
of
the
pit
for
he
had
pegged
out
all
the
main
points
of
the
history
of
man
or
rather
most
of
the
tenable
or
at
least
possible
theories
of
the
history
of
man
it
was
hard
to
hold
the
main
line
of
it
that
double
road
of
rationality
and
revelation
that
should
lead
always
to
a
fuller
and
fuller
development
not
the
fetish
of
progress
that
toy
word
used
only
by
toy
people
to
an
unfolding
and
growth
and
perfectibility
but
the
main
line
was
often
obscure
and
all
but
obliterated
and
traced
through
fog
and
miasma
he
had
accepted
the
fall
of
man
and
the
redemption
as
the
cardinal
points
of
history
but
he
understood
now
that
neither
happened
only
once
that
both
were
of
constant
occurrence
that
there
was
a
hand
reaching
up
from
that
old
pit
with
its
shadow
over
man
and
he
had
come
to
picture
that
hand
in
his
dreams
for
his
dreams
were
especially
vivid
when
in
the
state
as
a
monster
reaching
out
he
began
to
realize
that
the
thing
he
was
caught
in
was
dangerous
and
deadly
very
dangerous
very
deadly
one
of
the
weird
books
that
he
often
returned
to
and
which
continually
puzzled
him
was
the
relationship
of
extradigitalism
to
genius
written
by
the
man
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
in
one
of
his
manifestations
it
promised
more
than
it
delivered
and
it
intimated
more
than
it
said
its
theory
was
tedious
and
tenuous
bolstered
with
undigested
mountains
of
doubtful
data
it
left
him
unconvinced
that
persons
of
genius
even
if
it
could
be
agreed
who
or
what
they
were
had
often
the
oddity
of
extra
fingers
and
toes
or
the
vestiges
of
them
and
it
puzzled
him
what
possible
difference
it
could
make
yet
there
were
hints
here
of
a
corsican
who
commonly
kept
a
hand
hidden
or
an
earlier
and
more
bizarre
commander
who
wore
always
a
mailed
glove
of
another
man
with
a
glove
between
the
two
hints
that
the
leonardo
himself
who
sometimes
drew
the
hands
of
men
and
often
those
of
monsters
with
six
fingers
may
himself
have
had
the
touch
there
was
a
comment
of
caesar
not
conclusive
to
the
same
effect
it
is
known
that
alexander
had
a
minor
peculiarity
it
is
not
known
what
it
was
this
man
made
it
seem
that
this
was
it
and
it
was
averred
of
gregory
and
augustine
of
benedict
and
albert
and
acquinas
yet
a
man
with
a
deformity
could
not
enter
the
priesthood
if
they
had
it
it
must
have
been
in
vestigial
form
there
were
cases
for
charles
magnut
and
mahmud
for
saladin
the
horseman
and
for
akhnaton
the
king
for
homer
a
statuette
shows
him
with
six
fingers
strumming
an
unidentified
instrument
while
reciting
for
pythagoras
for
buonarroti
santi
theotokopolous
van
rijn
robusti
zurbarin
catalogued
eight
thousand
names
he
maintained
that
they
were
geniuses
and
that
they
were
extradigitals
charles
vincent
grinned
and
looked
down
at
his
misshapen
or
double
thumb
at
least
i
am
in
good
though
monotonous
company
but
what
in
the
name
of
triple
time
is
he
driving
at
and
it
was
not
long
afterward
that
vincent
was
examining
cuneiform
tablets
in
the
state
museum
these
were
a
broken
and
not
continuous
series
on
the
theory
of
numbers
tolerably
legible
to
the
now
encyclopedic
charles
vincent
and
the
series
read
in
part
on
the
divergence
of
the
basis
itself
and
the
confusion
caused
for
it
is
five
or
it
is
six
or
ten
or
twelve
or
sixty
or
a
hundred
or
three
hundred
and
sixty
or
the
double
hundred
the
thousand
the
reason
not
clearly
understood
by
the
people
is
that
six
and
the
dozen
are
first
and
sixty
is
a
compromise
in
condescending
to
the
people
for
the
five
the
ten
are
late
and
are
no
older
than
the
people
themselves
it
is
said
and
credited
that
people
began
to
count
by
fives
and
tens
from
the
number
of
fingers
on
their
hands
but
before
the
people
the
by
the
reason
that
they
had
counted
by
sixes
and
twelves
but
sixty
is
the
number
of
time
divisible
by
both
for
both
must
live
together
in
time
though
not
on
the
same
plane
of
time
much
of
the
rest
was
scattered
and
it
was
while
trying
to
set
the
hundreds
of
unordered
clay
tablets
in
proper
sequence
that
charles
vincent
created
the
legend
of
the
ghost
in
the
museum
for
he
spent
his
nights
there
studying
and
classifying
naturally
he
could
not
work
without
light
and
naturally
he
could
be
seen
when
he
sat
still
at
his
studies
but
as
the
guards
attempted
to
close
in
on
him
he
would
move
to
avoid
them
and
his
speed
made
him
invisible
to
them
they
were
a
nuisance
and
had
to
be
discouraged
he
belabored
them
soundly
and
they
became
less
eager
to
try
to
capture
him
his
only
fear
was
that
they
would
some
time
try
to
shoot
him
to
see
if
he
were
ghost
or
human
he
could
avoid
a
seen
shot
which
would
come
at
no
more
than
two
and
a
half
times
his
own
greatest
speed
but
an
unperceived
shot
could
penetrate
dangerously
even
fatally
before
he
twisted
away
from
it
he
had
fathered
legends
of
other
ghosts
that
of
the
central
library
that
of
university
library
that
of
the
john
charles
underwood
technical
library
this
plurality
of
ghosts
tended
to
cancel
out
each
other
and
bring
believers
into
ridicule
even
those
who
had
seen
him
as
a
ghost
did
not
admit
that
they
believed
in
the
ghosts
he
went
back
to
mason
for
his
monthly
checkup
you
look
terrible
said
the
doctor
whatever
it
is
you
have
changed
if
you
can
afford
it
you
should
take
a
long
rest
i
have
the
means
said
charles
vincent
and
that
is
just
what
i
will
do
i
take
a
rest
for
a
year
or
two
he
had
begun
to
begrudge
the
time
that
he
must
spend
at
the
world
pace
from
now
on
he
was
regarded
as
a
recluse
he
was
silent
and
unsociable
for
he
found
it
a
nuisance
to
come
back
to
the
common
state
to
engage
in
conversation
and
in
his
special
state
voices
were
too
to
intrude
into
his
consciousness
except
that
of
the
man
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
you
are
making
very
tardy
progress
said
the
man
once
more
they
were
in
a
dark
club
those
who
do
not
show
more
progress
we
can
not
use
after
all
you
are
only
a
vestigial
it
is
probable
that
you
have
very
little
of
the
ancient
race
in
you
fortunately
those
who
do
not
show
progress
destroy
themselves
you
had
not
imagined
that
there
were
only
two
phases
of
time
had
you
lately
i
have
come
to
suspect
that
there
are
many
more
said
charles
vincent
and
you
understand
that
only
one
step
can
not
succeed
i
understand
that
the
life
i
have
been
living
is
in
direct
violation
of
all
that
we
know
of
the
laws
of
mass
momentum
and
acceleration
as
well
as
those
of
conservation
of
energy
the
potential
of
the
human
person
the
moral
compensation
the
golden
mean
and
the
capacity
of
human
organs
i
know
that
i
can
not
multiply
energy
and
experience
sixty
times
without
a
compensating
increase
of
food
intake
and
yet
i
do
it
i
know
that
i
can
not
live
on
eight
minutes
sleep
in
hours
but
i
do
that
also
i
know
that
i
can
not
reasonably
crowd
four
thousand
years
of
experience
into
one
lifetime
yet
unreasonably
i
do
not
see
what
will
prevent
it
but
you
say
i
will
destroy
myself
those
who
take
only
the
first
step
destroy
themselves
and
how
does
one
take
the
second
step
at
the
proper
moment
you
will
be
given
the
choice
i
have
the
most
uncanny
feeling
that
i
will
refuse
the
choice
from
present
indications
you
will
refuse
it
you
are
fastidious
you
have
a
smell
about
you
old
man
without
a
face
i
know
now
what
it
is
it
is
the
smell
of
the
pit
are
you
so
slow
to
learn
that
it
is
the
mud
from
the
pit
the
same
from
which
the
clay
tablets
were
formed
from
the
old
land
between
the
rivers
i
dreamed
of
the
hand
reaching
up
from
the
pit
and
overshadowing
us
all
and
i
have
read
people
first
counted
by
fives
and
tens
from
the
number
of
fingers
on
their
hands
but
before
the
people
for
the
reason
that
they
had
counted
by
sixes
and
twelves
but
time
has
left
blanks
in
those
tablets
yes
time
in
one
of
its
manifestations
has
deftly
and
with
a
purpose
left
those
blanks
i
can
not
discover
the
name
of
the
thing
that
goes
in
one
of
those
blanks
can
you
i
am
part
of
the
name
that
goes
into
one
of
those
blanks
and
you
are
the
man
without
a
face
but
why
is
it
that
you
overshadow
and
control
people
and
to
what
purpose
it
will
be
long
before
you
know
those
answers
when
the
choice
comes
to
me
it
will
bear
very
careful
weighing
after
that
a
chill
descended
on
the
life
of
charles
vincent
for
all
that
he
still
possessed
his
exceptional
powers
and
he
seldom
now
indulged
in
pranks
except
for
jennifer
parkey
it
was
unusual
that
he
should
be
drawn
to
her
he
knew
her
only
slightly
in
the
common
world
and
she
was
at
least
fifteen
years
his
senior
but
now
she
appealed
to
him
for
her
youthful
qualities
and
all
his
pranks
with
her
were
gentle
ones
for
one
thing
this
spinster
did
not
frighten
nor
did
she
begin
locking
her
doors
never
having
bothered
about
such
things
before
he
would
come
behind
her
and
stroke
her
hair
and
she
would
speak
out
calmly
with
that
sort
of
quickening
in
her
voice
who
are
you
why
wo
you
let
me
see
you
you
are
a
friend
are
you
are
you
a
man
or
are
you
something
else
if
you
can
caress
me
why
ca
you
talk
to
me
please
let
me
see
you
i
promise
that
i
wo
hurt
you
it
was
as
though
she
could
not
imagine
that
anything
strange
would
hurt
her
or
again
when
he
hugged
her
or
kissed
her
on
the
nape
she
would
call
you
must
be
a
little
boy
or
very
like
a
little
boy
whoever
you
are
you
are
good
not
to
break
my
things
when
you
move
about
come
here
and
let
me
hold
you
it
is
only
very
good
people
who
have
no
fear
at
all
of
the
unknown
when
vincent
met
jennifer
in
the
regular
world
as
he
more
often
now
found
occasion
to
do
she
looked
at
him
appraisingly
as
though
she
guessed
some
sort
of
connection
she
said
one
day
i
know
it
is
an
impolite
thing
to
say
but
you
do
not
look
well
at
all
have
you
been
to
a
doctor
several
times
but
i
think
it
is
my
doctor
who
should
go
to
a
doctor
he
was
always
given
to
peculiar
remarks
but
now
he
is
becoming
a
little
unsettled
if
i
were
your
doctor
i
believe
i
would
also
become
a
little
unsettled
but
you
should
find
out
what
is
wrong
you
look
terrible
he
did
not
look
terrible
he
had
lost
his
hair
it
is
true
but
many
men
lose
their
hair
by
thirty
though
not
perhaps
as
suddenly
as
he
had
he
thought
of
attributing
it
to
the
air
resistance
after
all
when
he
was
in
the
state
he
did
stride
at
some
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
enough
of
that
is
likely
to
blow
the
hair
right
off
your
head
and
might
that
not
also
be
the
reason
for
his
worsened
complexion
and
the
tireder
look
that
appeared
in
his
eyes
but
he
knew
that
this
was
nonsense
he
felt
no
more
air
pressure
when
in
his
accelerated
state
than
when
in
the
normal
one
he
had
received
his
summons
he
chose
not
to
answer
it
he
did
not
want
to
be
presented
with
the
choice
he
had
no
wish
to
be
one
with
those
of
the
pit
but
he
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
the
great
advantage
which
he
now
held
over
nature
i
will
have
it
both
ways
he
said
i
am
already
a
contradiction
and
an
impossibility
the
proverb
was
only
the
early
statement
of
the
law
of
moral
compensation
ca
take
more
out
of
a
basket
than
it
holds
but
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
in
violation
of
the
laws
and
balances
is
no
road
without
a
turning
who
dance
will
have
to
pay
the
fiddler
that
goes
up
comes
down
but
are
proverbs
really
universal
laws
certainly
a
sound
proverb
has
the
force
of
universal
law
it
is
but
another
statement
of
it
but
i
have
contradicted
the
universal
laws
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
i
have
contradicted
them
with
impunity
action
has
its
reaction
if
i
refuse
to
deal
with
them
i
will
provoke
a
strong
reaction
the
man
without
a
face
said
that
it
was
always
a
race
between
full
knowing
and
destruction
very
well
i
will
race
them
for
it
they
began
to
persecute
him
then
he
knew
that
they
were
in
a
state
as
accelerated
from
his
as
his
was
from
the
normal
to
them
he
was
the
almost
motionless
statue
hardly
to
be
told
from
a
dead
man
to
him
they
were
by
their
speed
both
invisible
and
inaudible
they
hurt
him
and
haunted
him
but
still
he
would
not
answer
the
summons
when
the
meeting
took
place
it
was
they
who
had
to
come
to
him
and
they
materialized
there
in
his
room
men
without
faces
the
choice
said
one
you
force
us
to
be
so
clumsy
as
to
have
to
voice
it
i
will
have
no
part
of
you
you
all
smell
of
the
pit
of
that
old
mud
of
the
cuneiforms
of
the
land
between
the
rivers
of
the
people
who
were
before
the
people
it
has
endured
a
long
time
and
we
consider
it
as
enduring
forever
but
the
garden
which
was
in
the
neighborhood
do
you
know
how
long
the
garden
lasted
i
do
know
that
all
happened
in
a
single
day
and
before
nightfall
they
were
outside
you
want
to
throw
in
with
something
more
permanent
do
you
no
i
do
believe
i
do
what
have
you
to
lose
only
my
hope
of
eternity
but
you
do
believe
in
that
no
man
has
ever
really
believed
in
eternity
no
man
has
ever
either
entirely
believed
or
disbelieved
in
it
said
charles
vincent
at
least
it
can
not
be
proved
said
one
of
the
faceless
men
nothing
is
proved
until
it
is
over
with
and
in
this
case
if
it
is
ever
over
with
then
it
is
disproved
and
all
that
time
would
one
not
be
tempted
to
wonder
if
after
all
it
ends
in
the
next
minute
i
imagine
that
if
we
survive
the
flesh
we
will
receive
some
sort
of
surety
said
vincent
but
you
are
not
sure
either
of
such
surviving
or
receiving
now
have
a
very
close
approximation
of
eternity
when
time
is
multiplied
by
itself
and
that
repeated
again
and
again
does
that
not
approximate
eternity
i
do
believe
it
does
but
i
will
not
be
of
you
one
of
you
has
said
that
i
am
too
fastidious
so
now
will
you
say
that
you
destroy
me
no
we
will
only
let
you
be
destroyed
by
yourself
you
can
not
win
the
race
with
destruction
after
that
charles
vincent
somehow
felt
more
mature
he
knew
he
was
not
really
meant
to
be
a
thing
of
the
pit
he
knew
that
in
some
way
he
would
have
to
pay
for
every
minute
and
hour
that
he
had
gained
but
what
he
had
gained
he
would
use
to
the
fullest
and
whatever
could
be
accomplished
by
sheer
acquisition
of
human
knowledge
he
would
try
to
accomplish
and
he
now
startled
mason
by
the
medical
knowledge
he
had
picked
up
the
while
the
doctor
amused
him
by
the
concern
he
showed
for
vincent
for
he
felt
fine
he
was
perhaps
not
as
active
as
he
had
been
but
that
was
only
because
he
had
become
dubious
of
aimless
activity
he
was
still
the
ghost
of
the
libraries
and
museums
but
was
puzzled
that
the
published
reports
intimated
that
an
old
ghost
had
replaced
a
young
one
he
now
paid
his
mystic
visits
to
jennifer
parkey
less
often
for
he
was
always
dismayed
to
hear
her
exclaim
to
him
in
his
ghostly
form
your
touch
is
so
changed
you
poor
thing
is
there
anything
at
all
i
can
do
to
help
you
he
decided
that
somehow
she
was
too
immature
to
understand
him
though
he
was
still
fond
of
her
he
transferred
his
affections
to
milly
maltby
a
widow
at
least
thirty
years
his
senior
yet
here
it
was
a
sort
of
girlishness
in
her
that
appealed
to
him
she
was
a
woman
of
sharp
wit
and
real
affection
and
she
also
accepted
his
visitations
without
fear
following
a
little
initial
panic
they
played
games
writing
games
for
they
communicated
by
writing
she
would
scribble
a
line
then
hold
the
paper
up
in
the
air
whence
he
would
cause
it
to
vanish
into
his
sphere
he
would
return
it
in
half
a
minute
or
half
a
second
by
her
time
with
his
retort
he
had
the
advantage
of
her
in
time
with
greatly
more
opportunity
to
think
up
responses
but
she
had
the
advantage
over
him
in
natural
wit
and
was
hard
to
top
they
also
played
checkers
and
he
often
had
to
retire
apart
and
read
a
chapter
of
a
book
on
the
art
between
moves
and
even
so
she
often
beat
him
for
native
talent
is
likely
to
be
a
match
for
accumulated
lore
and
codified
procedure
but
to
milly
also
he
was
unfaithful
in
his
fashion
being
now
interested
he
no
longer
became
enamored
or
entranced
in
a
roberts
a
who
was
his
elder
by
at
least
fifty
years
he
had
read
all
the
data
extant
on
the
attraction
of
the
old
for
the
young
but
he
still
could
not
explain
his
successive
attachments
he
decided
that
these
three
examples
were
enough
to
establish
a
universal
law
that
a
woman
is
simply
not
afraid
of
a
ghost
though
he
touches
her
and
is
invisible
and
writes
her
notes
without
hands
it
is
possible
that
amorous
spirits
have
known
this
for
a
long
time
but
charles
vincent
had
made
the
discovery
himself
independently
when
enough
knowledge
is
accumulated
on
any
subject
the
pattern
will
sometimes
emerge
suddenly
like
a
form
in
a
picture
revealed
where
before
it
was
not
seen
and
when
enough
knowledge
is
accumulated
on
all
subjects
is
there
not
a
chance
that
a
pattern
governing
all
subjects
will
emerge
charles
vincent
was
caught
up
in
one
last
enthusiasm
on
a
long
vigil
as
he
consulted
source
after
source
and
sorted
them
in
his
mind
it
seemed
that
the
pattern
was
coming
out
clearly
and
simply
for
all
its
amazing
complexity
of
detail
i
know
everything
that
they
know
in
the
pit
and
i
know
a
secret
that
they
do
not
know
i
have
not
lost
the
race
i
have
won
it
i
can
defeat
them
at
the
point
where
they
believe
themselves
invulnerable
if
controlled
hereafter
we
need
at
least
not
be
controlled
by
them
it
is
all
falling
together
now
i
have
found
the
final
truth
and
it
is
they
who
have
lost
the
race
i
hold
the
key
i
will
now
be
able
to
enjoy
the
advantage
without
paying
the
ultimate
price
of
defeat
and
destruction
or
of
collaboration
with
them
now
i
have
only
to
implement
my
knowledge
to
publish
the
fact
and
one
shadow
at
least
will
be
lifted
from
mankind
i
will
do
it
at
once
well
nearly
at
once
it
is
almost
dawn
in
the
normal
world
i
will
sit
here
a
very
little
while
and
rest
then
i
will
go
out
and
begin
to
make
contact
with
the
proper
persons
for
the
disposition
of
this
thing
but
first
i
will
sit
here
a
little
while
and
rest
and
he
died
quietly
in
his
chair
as
he
sat
there
mason
made
an
entry
in
his
private
journal
charles
vincent
a
completely
authenticated
case
of
premature
aging
one
of
the
most
in
all
gerontology
this
man
was
known
to
me
for
years
and
i
here
aver
that
as
of
one
year
ago
he
was
of
normal
appearance
and
physical
state
and
that
his
chronology
is
also
correct
i
having
also
known
his
father
i
examined
the
subject
during
the
period
of
his
illness
and
there
is
no
question
at
all
of
his
identity
which
has
also
been
established
for
the
record
by
fingerprinting
and
other
means
i
aver
that
charles
vincent
at
the
age
of
thirty
is
dead
of
old
age
having
the
appearance
and
organic
condition
of
a
man
of
ninety
then
the
doctor
began
to
make
another
note
as
in
two
other
cases
of
my
own
observation
the
illness
was
accompanied
by
a
certain
delusion
and
series
of
dreams
so
nearly
identical
in
the
three
men
as
to
be
almost
unbelievable
and
for
the
record
and
no
doubt
to
the
prejudice
of
my
own
reputation
i
will
set
down
the
report
of
them
here
but
when
mason
had
written
that
he
thought
about
it
for
a
while
no
i
will
do
no
such
thing
he
said
and
he
struck
out
the
last
lines
he
had
written
it
is
best
to
let
sleeping
dragons
lie
and
somewhere
the
faceless
men
with
the
smell
of
the
pit
on
them
smiled
to
themselves
in
quiet
irony
end
