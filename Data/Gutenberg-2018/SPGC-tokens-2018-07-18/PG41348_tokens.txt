as

turned
to
one
of
the
women
do
you
think
that
my

may
have
taken
another

that
sailed
faster
than
this

i
will
not

that

mistress

turned
away
that
the

might
not

that
filled

love

father
just
before
the

that
bore
the
pilgrims
from
england
had
sailed
had
been
cast
into
prison
by
the
king
because
of
his
faith
love
was
all
alone
but
mistress
brewster
did
not
want
her
to
know
of
her
father
s
fate
perhaps
your
father
will
meet
you
some
day
soon
in
holland
surely
if
he
said
that
he
would
not
be
long
he
will
keep
his
word
see
love
see
the
little
boy
of
your
own
age
down
there
in
the
fishing
love
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
the
woman
pointed
a
plump
rosy
little
boy
with
eyes
as
blue
as
love
s
own
and
dressed
in
full
brown
trousers
and
clumsy
wooden
shoes
sat
on
a
big
net
in
one
end
of
the
boat
he
looked
up
as
the
sails
of
the
little
fishing
craft
brought
it
alongside
the
boat
that
bore
the
wanderers
from
england
at
first
he
dropped
his
eyes
in
shyness
at
sight
of
the
little
girl
then
he
lifted
them
again
and
as
his
eyes
met
hers
the
two
children
smiled
at
each
other
it
was
like
a
flash
of
sunshine
piercing
the
gray
haze
that
hung
over
the
sea
there
were
friends
waiting
on
the
shore
for
all
save
love
older
brothers
these
were
fathers
and
other
relatives
who
had
made
the
pilgrimage
from
england
a
few
months
before
and
had
homes
ready
for
them
all
they
climbed
a
long
hill
very
flat
on
the
top
and
reached
by
a
flight
of
steps
then
they
were
as
high
as
the
trees
that
lined
the
beach
and
could
look
over
the
narrow
streets
the
tidy
cottages
with
their
red
roofs
and
the
pretty
gardens
there
were
many
little
canals
like
blue
ribbons
cutting
the
green
fields
welcome
to
amsterdam
said
a
dutch
housewife
in
wide
white
cap
and
apron
who
met
them
she
put
her
hand
on
love
s
yellow
hair
and
in
which
house
are
you
going
to
live
little
english
blossom
she
asked
kindly
love
looked
up
wonderingly
into
her
face
and
there
was
a
whispered
consultation
between
mistress
brewster
and
the
amsterdam
woman
poor
little
blossom
she
shall
come
home
with
me
there
is
always
room
for
one
more
in
the
stork
s
nest
the
dutch
woman
said
kindly
she
took
love
s
hand
and
led
her
away
from
the
others
and
along
the
canal
the
house
where
they
stopped
was
very
odd
indeed
it
was
made
of
red
and
yellow
bricks
and
it
stood
on
great
posts
sunk
deep
into
the
ground
opening
the
white
door
that
fairly
shone
it
was
so
clean
they
were
in
the
kitchen
such
a
kitchen
it
was
so
cosy
and
so
quaint
the
floor
was
made
of
white
tiles
and
there
was
a
queer
little
fireplace
it
looked
like
a
big
brass
pan
filled
with
coals
and
there
was
a
shining
copper
kettle
hung
over
it
by
a
chain
from
the
ceiling
the
kettle
bubbled
and
sang
a
cheerful
welcome
to
love
there
were
stiff
white
curtains
at
the
windows
and
on
the
sill
of
one
was
a
row
of
blossoming
plants
blue
and
white
dishes
and
a
pair
of
tall
candlesticks
stood
on
a
shelf
love
could
see
a
bright
sitting
room
beyond
and
another
room
where
there
was
a
strange
bed
built
in
the
wall
and
stretching
almost
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
jan
jan
the
woman
called
come
in
from
the
garden
and
offer
your
new
little
english
sister
a
seed
cake
you
may
have
one
yourself
too
you
have
long
wished
for
a
playmate
and
here
is
one
come
to
live
in
the
house
with
the
door
opened
slowly
and
in
came
jan
he
did
not
look
up
at
first
then
his
eyes
caught
love
s
it
was
the
little
boy
of
the
fishing
boat
his
dear
mother
it
was
who
had
offered
to
take
care
of
lonely
little
love
illustration
the
kettle
bubbled
and
sang
a
cheerful
welcome
to
love
you
may
help
me
drive
the
dogs
that
draw
the
milk
wagon
jan
said
to
love
the
next
morning
after
they
had
become
very
well
acquainted
over
their
breakfast
of
milk
and
oatmeal
cakes
and
so
i
can
help
to
earn
money
for
your
kind
mother
love
said
with
shining
eyes
jan
had
two
dogs
and
a
little
cart
to
which
he
harnessed
them
every
morning
into
the
cart
his
mother
put
two
shining
pails
of
milk
and
a
long
handled
dipper
for
measuring
she
put
in
some
round
white
cheeses
and
golden
balls
of
butter
off
started
the
cart
along
the
narrow
street
with
love
running
gaily
along
one
side
and
jan
clattering
along
in
his
wooden
shoes
on
the
other
side
the
dogs
knew
where
to
stop
almost
as
well
as
jan
did
for
they
had
made
the
trip
so
many
times
the
cheese
and
butter
were
soon
gone
and
every
one
had
a
pleasant
smile
for
the
little
english
lass
at
one
cottage
a
dutch
housewife
brought
out
a
strange
bulb
that
she
put
in
love
s
hands
then
smiling
down
into
the
little
girl
s
wondering
face
she
said
it
is
a
rare
one
indeed
i
give
it
to
you
that
you
may
plant
it
and
tend
it
all
winter
when
the
spring
comes
you
will
have
a
finer
one
than
any
child
in
all
love
thanked
the
woman
but
she
puzzled
over
the
hard
dry
bulb
as
she
and
jan
walked
home
beside
the
empty
milk
cart
it
looks
like
nothing
but
an
onion
what
good
is
it
jan
jan
s
eyes
twinkled
i
know
but
i
won
t
tell
he
said
i
want
you
to
be
surprised
next
spring
come
love
we
will
plant
it
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
that
the
sun
shines
on
first
in
the
spring
then
we
will
as
jan
dug
a
hole
and
love
planted
the
bulb
his
words
repeated
themselves
in
the
little
girl
s
lonely
heart
she
remembered
too
what
her
dear
father
had
said
last
to
her
wait
patiently
until
i
come
would
her
patience
bring
the
hard
bulb
to
life
or
her
father
back
love
wondered
sorrowfully
the
days
passed
with
blue
skies
and
the
bright
sun
shining
down
upon
the
canal
and
then
grew
shorter
the
storks
flew
south
and
love
was
very
happy
her
days
with
jan
were
busy
merry
ones
she
too
had
wooden
shoes
now
and
jan
s
mother
had
made
her
a
warm
red
skirt
and
a
velvet
girdle
and
a
little
green
quilted
coat
love
looked
like
a
real
little
dutch
girl
as
she
skated
to
school
with
her
knitting
in
her
school
bag
to
busy
her
fingers
with
when
it
was
recess
time
there
was
never
any
place
in
england
love
thought
so
merry
and
gay
as
the
frozen
canal
in
front
of
her
new
home
in
holland
everybody
was
on
skates
the
market
women
with
wooden
yokes
over
their
shoulders
from
which
hung
baskets
of
vegetables
and
even
a
mother
skating
and
holding
her
baby
in
a
snug
nest
made
of
a
shawl
on
her
back
the
old
doctor
skated
with
his
pill
bag
on
one
arm
to
see
a
sick
patient
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
and
long
rows
of
happy
children
glided
by
holding
each
other
s
coats
and
twisting
and
twining
about
like
a
gay
ribbon
are
you
not
glad
love
that
you
came
here
to
holland
to
be
my
sister
jan
asked
as
holding
her
hand
in
his
he
skated
with
love
to
school
i
am
glad
jan
love
laughed
back
i
feel
as
if
it
were
a
story
book
that
i
am
living
in
and
you
and
your
dear
mother
and
our
house
and
the
canal
were
the
pictures
in
it
but
oh
jan
i
wish
very
much
that
i
could
see
my
tall
and
brave
and
strong
then
she
stopped
we
must
be
hastening
jan
she
said
or
we
shall
be
late
for
but
to
herself
love
was
saying
be
spring
came
early
that
year
in
amsterdam
the
ice
melted
and
the
canals
were
once
more
blue
ribbons
of
water
the
sails
of
the
windmills
whirred
and
the
housewives
scrubbed
their
sidewalks
until
the
stones
were
clean
enough
to
eat
from
the
storks
built
again
in
the
red
chimneys
and
everywhere
the
tulips
burst
into
bloom
love
had
never
seen
such
beautiful
flowers
in
all
her
life
there
was
no
garden
in
all
amsterdam
so
small
or
so
poor
as
not
to
have
a
bed
of
bright
red
and
yellow
tulips
with
the
first
sunshine
love
went
out
to
the
garden
where
she
and
jan
had
planted
the
ugly
hard
bulb
how
wonderful
her
patience
had
been
rewarded
there
were
two
tall
straight
green
leaves
and
between
them
like
a
wonderful
cup
upon
its
green
stem
a
great
beautiful
tulip
it
was
larger
than
any
of
the
others
it
was
not
red
or
yellow
like
the
others
but
pink
like
a
rose
or
a
sunrise
cloud
or
a
baby
s
cheek
come
jan
come
mother
cried
love
and
then
the
three
stood
about
the
pink
tulip
in
admiration
it
is
the
most
beautiful
tulip
in
all
amsterdam
said
it
is
worth
money
said
his
mother
some
one
would
pay
a
good
price
for
the
love
remembered
what
jan
s
mother
had
said
as
the
days
passed
and
the
pink
tulip
opened
wider
and
showed
a
deeper
tint
each
day
a
plan
began
to
form
in
the
little
girl
s
mind
she
knew
that
there
was
not
very
much
money
in
jan
s
home
to
which
she
had
been
so
kindly
welcomed
she
knew
too
that
nothing
was
so
dear
to
the
people
of
holland
as
their
tulips
strange
tales
were
told
how
they
sold
houses
cattle
land
everything
to
buy
tulip
bulbs
illustration
jan
and
his
dog
cart
one
saturday
when
jan
was
away
doing
an
errand
for
his
mother
love
dug
up
her
precious
pink
tulip
and
planted
it
carefully
in
a
large
flower
pot
with
the
pot
hugged
close
to
her
heart
she
went
swiftly
away
from
the
house
down
the
long
steps
and
as
far
as
the
road
that
led
along
the
coast
of
the
sea
below
the
dike
here
where
great
merchant
ships
from
all
over
the
world
anchored
almost
every
day
love
felt
sure
that
some
one
would
see
her
tulip
and
want
to
buy
it
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
many
nations
busy
unloading
cargoes
at
first
no
one
saw
the
little
girl
with
the
flower
in
her
arms
up
and
down
the
shore
she
walked
a
little
frightened
but
brave
she
held
the
flower
high
and
called
in
her
sweet
voice
a
rare
pink
tulip
who
will
buy
my
pink
tulip
intent
on
holding
the
flower
carefully
she
came
suddenly
in
front
of
a
man
who
had
been
walking
in
lonely
fashion
up
and
down
the
shore
she
heard
him
call
her
name
eagerly
love
love
oh
my
little
love
looking
up
love
almost
dropped
the
tulip
in
her
joy
then
she
set
it
down
and
rushed
into
his
arms
father
dear
father
oh
where
have
you
been
so
long
she
cried
it
was
a
story
told
between
laughter
and
tears
goodman
bradford
only
a
short
time
since
released
from
prison
had
come
straight
to
amsterdam
but
he
had
been
able
to
find
no
trace
of
love
mistress
brewster
had
gone
on
with
the
pilgrims
to
america
and
there
was
no
one

his
little
daughter
was
now
he
could
make
a
home
for
her

as
you
bade
me

she
cried
as
hand
in

they
reached
the
quaint
little
cottage
where
jan
and
his
mother
stood
at
the
door
to
greet
them
in
good
time
they
both
came

chapters
in
the
bible
as
well
as
any
child
in
that
is
good
mistress
edwards
said
pulling
the
boy
s
long
dark
cloak
more
closely
about
him
and
smoothing
the
cloth
of
his
tall
hat
preserve
edwards
was
a
puritan
lad
of
many
years
ago
the
log
cabin
that
he
was
leaving
to
walk
two
miles
through
the
clearing
and
across
the
woods
to
school
was
but
a
rough
home
a
few
straight
chairs
and
a
hard
settle
made
of
logs
and
standing
by
the
fireplace
a
deal
table
and
the
few
pewter
utensils
were
almost
the
only
furnishings
of
the
living
room
in
one
corner
stood
an
old
musket
mistress
edwards
looked
toward
it
now
in
fear
do
you
come
home
as
soon
as
school
is
out
preserve
i
pray
you
do
not
linger
on
the
way
to
play
hare
and
hounds
with
the
other
boys
and
girls
of
the
village
remember
my
boy
that
your
father
is
away
with
the
horse
these
two
days
to
fetch
back
a
piece
of
cloth
and
some
flour
from
boston
for
me
he
is
not
likely
to
come
home
for
some
days
yet
and
i
am
full
of
strange
dread
at
what
i
saw
in
the
cornfield
this
what
did
you
see
mother
preserve
s
eyes
opened
wide
with
wonder
it
was
not
so
much
what
i
saw
but
what
it
portended
for
us
mistress
edwards
said
it
was
only
a
flash
of
color
like
painted
feathers
among
the
withered
stalks
of
corn
it
minded
me
of
big
hawk
s
headdress
if
he
were
to
find
out
that
we
were
alone
one
helpless
woman
and
a
boy
of
twelve
here
i
think
it
would
go
badly
with
preserve
laughed
bravely
then
he
reached
up
to
kiss
his
mother
it
was
no
more
than
a
blackbird
that
you
saw
he
said
or
perhaps
it
was
a
bright
tanager
the
birds
are
getting
ready
to
flock
now
for
they
feel
the
autumn
chill
in
the
air
but
i
will
hurry
my
ribbon
preserve
added
then
he
ran
down
the
little
path
to
the
gate
in
the
paling
that
surrounded
the
cabin
his
speller
under
his
arm
and
his
buckled
shoes
making
the
dry
leaves
scatter
as
he
went
it
was
a
long
road
and
a
lonely
one
to
the
log
schoolhouse
preserve
took
his
way
through
the
cornfield
where
the
dried
stalks
rattling
in
the
cold
wind
made
him
think
of
the
songs
that
he
had
heard
big
hawk
and
his
tribe
sing
the
last
time
they
attacked
the
little
colonial
settlement
that
had
been
some
months
since
now
and
preserve
could
find
no
traces
of
footprints
or
any
other
marks
of
indians
in
the
cornfield
my
mother
had
a
fear
for
nothing
preserve
said
to
himself
he
went
through
a
bit
of
woods
next
and
pulled
a
small
square
of
bark
from
one
of
the
many
birch
trees
that
stood
there
so
white
and
still
it
was
for
preserve
to
write
his
sums
upon
in
school
and
as
he
hurried
on
he
repeated
his
tables
over
and
over
to
be
sure
that
he
knew
them
well
there
were
log
cabins
scattered
here
and
there
and
from
these
came
other
boys
and
girls
who
followed
preserve
on
the
way
to
school
deliverance
baxter
joined
preserve
she
wore
a
long
scant
gray
frock
and
her
yellow
hair
was
tucked
tightly
inside
a
close
white
cap
a
white
kerchief
was
folded
neatly
around
her
neck
and
she
also
wore
big
buckles
on
her
black
slippers
her
eyes
twinkled
roguishly
though
as
she
chatted
to
preserve
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
preserve
but
that
you
will
wear
home
the
long
streamers
of
red
ribbon
on
your
cape
this
afternoon
i
have
been
quite
as
perfect
as
you
in
my
lessons
for
the
month
but
woe
is
me
i
did
a
great
wrong
yesterday
you
know
that
master
biddle
our
schoolmaster
has
just
purchased
a
new
wig
from
boston
town
the
queue
in
the
back
is
so
unusually
long
and
tied
with
such
a
large
bow
that
it
caught
my
eye
when
i
was
getting
the
pile
of
copy
books
from
behind
his
desk
i
know
not
preserve
what
witchery
was
in
my
fingers
but
i
tied
master
biddle
s
queue
to
his
chair
when
he
stood
up
why
his
wig
was
greatly
disarranged
and
i
must
needs
stay
after
school
until
dusk
sitting
on
the
dunce
s
stool
i
am
most
sorry
and
will
never
be
so
again
you
see
i
stand
small
chance
of
the
ribbon
now
illustration
i
tied
master
biddle
s
queue
to
his
chair
the
boy
laughed
but
he
took
the
little
girl
s
hand
comfortingly
in
his
reaching
in
his
lunch
bag
he
took
out
a
red
apple
and
slipped
it
into
the
big
pocket
that
hung
at
her
side
you
were
always
a
bit
roguish
in
spite
of
your
puritan
dress
and
sober
living
deliverance
he
said
never
mind
about
the
ribbon
if
i
should
win
it
why
there
is
all
the
more
chance
of
its
being
yours
the
next
time
here
we
are
see
to
it
deliverance
that
you
tie
no
more
queues
oh
see
how
finely
master
biddle
is
dressed
for
giving
out
the
prizes
preserve
said
as
they
reached
the
schoolhouse
door
and
took
their
places
behind
the
rude
desks
built
of
boards
and
resting
on
pegs
in
the
floor
other
children
were
quietly
taking
their
places
in
the
little
schoolroom
the
smaller
ones
perched
on
hard
benches
made
of
logs
they
all
looked
in
awe
at
the
schoolmaster
who
stood
on
a
platform
facing
them
he
wore
a
smart
velvet
coat
with
long
tails
and
inside
it
could
be
seen
a
waist
coat
which
was
very
long
and
a
fine
white
shirt
with
ruffles
his
knee
breeches
were
of
velvet
like
his
coat
and
there
were
silver
buckles
at
the
knees
as
well
as
on
his
shoes
a
stock
was
wound
about
his
neck
and
worn
to
keep
his
head
stiff
and
straight
as
became
the
dignity
of
the
times
above
all
was
his
white
powdered
wig
neatly
braided
in
the
back
looking
at
master
biddle
alone
was
enough
to
make
the
children
of
the
colonies
sit
up
very
straight
and
recite
their
lessons
as
well
as
they
could
there
was
a
prayer
first
and
then
the
boys
and
girls
recited
their
reading
spelling
and
arithmetic
their
pencils
were
thick
plummets
of
lead
and
their
copy
books
were
made
of
foolscap
paper
sewed
in
the
shape
of
books
and
carefully
ruled
by
hand
at
eleven
o
clock
came
recess
and
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
the
awarding
of
the
ribbons
for
perfect
deportment
master
biddle
announced
as
he
pinned
a
bow
of
blue
ribbon
to
one
boy
s
cape
for
poor
lessons
he
said
sadly
as
he
fastened
a
black
bow
to
another
then
he
held
up
a
red
bow
with
especially
long
streaming
ends
for
perfect
deportment
and
for
perfect
lessons
he
said
as
he
fastened
the
red
ribbon
bow
to
preserve
edward
s
cape
it
would
seem
but
a
small
prize
but
in
the
eyes
of
these
puritan
boys
and
girls
of
so
many
years
ago
the
bow
of
ribbon
its
streamers
of
red
gayly
flying
over
the
long
cape
of
a
boy
or
the
dull
frock
of
a
little
girl
was
a
mark
of
great
honor
indeed
ribbons
were
scarce
and
high
in
price
in
those
days
colors
for
children
were
almost
forbidden
and
for
their
elders
as
well
so
preserve
walked
out
of
the
school
door
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
his
head
very
high
and
started
home
as
proudly
as
any
soldier
wearing
a
decoration
for
bravery
he
did
not
notice
how
the
dusk
was
settling
down
all
about
him
the
trees
on
either
side
made
dark
shadows
and
there
was
no
sound
except
the
whir
of
a
partridge
s
wing
or
the
rattle
of
a
falling
nut
he
did
not
hear
the
soft
footfall
behind
him
until
deliverance
breathless
and
her
face
white
with
fear
was
upon
him
she
laid
a
soft
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
whispered
in
his
ear
i
beg
you
preserve
to
let
me
walk
with
you
i
know
that
it
is
not
far
to
my
cabin
but
all
the
way
through
these
woods
i
have
heard
strange
sounds
and
i
fancy
even
now
that
i
see
shapes
behind
the
trees
and
preserve
took
the
timid
little
girl
s
hand
and
tried
to
laugh
away
her
fears
so
was
my
mother
afraid
this
morning
at
nothing
he
said
she
was
of
a
mind
that
she
saw
the
boy
s
voice
was
suddenly
hushed
towering
in
the
path
in
front
of
the
children
like
a
great
forest
tree
dressed
in
its
gorgeous
cloak
of
gaudy
autumn
leaves
stood
the
indian
chief
big
hawk
he
wore
his
war
paint
and
his
festival
headdress
of
hawk
s
feathers
slung
over
his
blanket
were
his
bow
and
a
quiver
full
of
new
arrows
it
seemed
little
more
than
a
second
before
the
edges
of
the
path
and
the
deep
places
among
the
trees
on
either
side
were
alive
with
the
indians
of
big
hawk
s
tribe
illustration
he
pointed
toward
his
tribe
s
camping
place
big
hawk
looked
at
the
frightened
children
indicating
with
gestures
what
was
his
plan
he
pushed
back
the
white
cap
from
deliverance
s
pale
forehead
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
little
girl
s
sunny
hair
then
he
pointed
toward
his
tribe
s
camping
place
in
the
west
he
wanted
to
take
deliverance
there
and
hold
her
for
a
ransom
to
preserve
he
made
gestures
showing
that
he
wished
him
to
lead
the
way
to
the
edwards
cabin
that
they
might
plunder
it
before
going
back
that
night
deliverance
clung
crying
to
preserve
he
tried
to
be
brave
but
it
was
a
test
for
a
man
s
courage
and
he
was
only
a
boy
it
was
a
second
s
thought
and
a
strange
whim
of
a
savage
that
saved
the
two
the
wind
of
the
fall
blowing
through
the
trees
caught
the
ends
of
preserve
s
ribbon
of
honor
and
sent
them
fluttering
like
tongues
of
flame
against
the
dark
of
the
tree
trunks
the
color
caught
big
hawk
s
eye
and
he
touched
the
bow
on
preserve
s
cloak
with
one
hand
quick
as
a
flash
a
thought
came
to
preserve
he
drew
back
from
big
hawk
s
touch
and
put
his
own
hands
over
the
ribbon
as
if
to
guard
it
heap
big
chief
preserve
s
voice
rang
out
brave
and
clear
then
after
waiting
a
second
he
unpinned
the
red
bow
and
held
it
high
before
big
hawk
s
face
big
hawk
heap
bigger
chief
he
said
as
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
indian
and
fastened
the
ribbon
on
his
blanket
then
he
motioned
to
big
hawk
to
return
to
his
camp
and
show
the
rest
of
the
tribe
his
new
decoration
a
slow
smile
overspread
big
hawk
s
painted
face
then
he
turned
and
motioning
to
his
braves
to
follow
him
went
silently
back
through
the
woods
leaving
preserve
and
deliverance
alone
and
safe
deliverance
was
the
first
to
speak
my
heart
does
beat
so
fast
i
can
scarcely
breathe
preserve
oh
but
you
are
a
brave
boy
what
shall
we
do
now
the
little
girl
asked
run
said
preserve
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
we
had
best
run
like
rabbits
deliverance
hand
in
hand
the
two
scampered
along
preserve
helping
the
little
girl
over
the
rough
places
until
the
light
from
a
candle
in
deliverance
s
cabin
was
in
sight
her
father
had
come
home
early
and
when
the
children
told
him
of
their
adventure
he
set
out
to
warn
the
rest
of
the
settlers
of
the
danger
so
bravely
averted
and
put
them
on
guard
against
the
indians
preserve
went
on
home
alone
his
mother
stood
in
the
cabin
door
anxious
because
he
was
so
late
no
ribbon
oh
my
lad
why
have
you
disappointed
me
she
said
when
she
saw
him
big
hawk
wears
my
decoration
preserve
said
as
he
told
his
story
but
i
think
that
master
biddle
would
have
rather
that
little
mistress
deliverance
for
all
her
witching
ways
had
his
red
bow
he
finished
laughing
the
soap
making
of
remember
biddle
it
may
chance
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
return
by
thanksgiving
day
remember
biddle
asked
with
almost
a
sob
in
her
voice
a
little
puritan
girl
of
long
ago
was
remember
dressed
in
a
long
straight
gown
of
gray
stuff
heavy
hobnailed
shoes
and
wearing
a
white
kerchief
crossed
about
her
neck
she
stood
in
the
door
of
the
little
log
that
looked
out
upon
the
dreary
stretch
of
the
atlantic
coast
with
plymouth
rock
raising
its
gray
head
not
so
very
far
away
no
wonder
remember
felt
unhappy
her
mother
was
at
the
door
mounted
upon
their
horse
and
ready
to
start
away
for
quite
a
long
journey
as
journeys
were
counted
in
those
days
she
was
going
with
a
bundle
of
herbs
to
care
for
a
sick
neighbor
who
lived
a
distance
of
ten
miles
away
it
had
been
an
urgent
summons
brought
by
the
post
carrier
that
morning
the
neighbor
was
ill
indeed
and
the
fame
of
mistress
biddle
s
herb
brewing
was
well
known
through
the
countryside
she
leaned
down
from
the
saddle
to
touch
remember
s
dark
braids
the
little
girl
had
run
out
beside
the
horse
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
soft
side
her
father
was
far
away
in
boston
attending
to
some
important
matters
of
shipping
her
mother
s
going
left
remember
all
alone
she
repeated
her
question
shall
i
be
alone
for
thanksgiving
day
mother
dear
she
asked
illustration
shall
i
be
alone
for
thanksgiving
day
mother
dear
her
mother
turned
away
that
the
little
daughter
might
not
see
that
her
eyes
as
well
were
full
of
sorrow
i
know
not
remember
i
sent
a
letter
this
morning
by
the
post
carrier
to
boston
telling
your
father
that
i
should
wait
for
him
at
neighbor
allison
s
and
if
i
could
leave
the
poor
woman
he
could
come
home
with
me
i
hope
that
we
shall
be
here
in
time
for
thanksgiving
day
but
if
it
should
happen
remember
that
you
must
be
alone
take
no
thought
of
your
loneliness
think
only
of
how
much
cause
we
have
for
being
thankful
in
this
free
fertile
land
of
new
england
and
keep
busy
dear
child
you
will
find
plenty
to
do
in
the
house
until
my
throwing
the
girl
a
kiss
mistress
biddle
gave
the
horse
a
light
touch
with
her
riding
whip
and
was
off
down
the
road
her
long
dark
cloak
blowing
like
a
gray
cloud
on
the
horizon
in
the
chill
november
wind
for
a
few
moments
remember
leaned
against
the
beams
of
the
door
listening
to
the
call
of
a
flock
of
flying
crows
and
the
crackling
of
the
dried
cornstalks
in
the
field
back
of
the
house
beyond
the
cornfield
lay
the
brown
and
green
woods
uncut
save
by
an
occasional
winding
indian
trail
the
neighboring
cabins
were
so
far
away
that
they
looked
like
toy
houses
set
on
the
edge
of
other
fields
of
dried
cornstalks
looking
again
toward
the
woods
remember
shivered
a
little
she
saw
in
imagination
a
tall
dark
figure
in
gay
blanket
and
trailing
feather
headdress
stalk
out
from
the
depths
of
the
thicket
of
pines
and
oaks
then
she
laughed
there
hasn
t
an
indian
passed
here
since
early
in
the
summer
she
said
to
herself
mother
would
not
have
left
me
here
alone
if
she
had
not
known
that
i
should
be
quite
safe
i
will
go
in
now
and
play
that
i
am
the
mistress
of
this
house
and
i
am
getting
it
ready
for
company
on
thanksgiving
day
it
will
be
so
much
fun
that
i
shall
forget
all
about
being
a
lonely
little
it
was
a
happy
play
remember
tied
one
of
her
mother
s
long
aprons
over
her
dress
to
keep
it
clean
and
began
her
busy
work
of
cleaning
the
house
and
making
it
shine
from
cellar
to
ceiling
she
sorted
the
piles
of
ruddy
apples
and
winter
squashes
and
pumpkins
in
the
cellar
and
rehung
the
slabs
of
rich
bacon
and
the
strings
of
onions
as
she
touched
the
bundles
of
savory
herbs
that
hung
about
the
cellar
walls
remember
gave
a
little
sigh
i
see
no
chance
of
these
being
used
in
the
stuffing
of
a
fat
turkey
for
thanksgiving
she
said
to
herself
it
may
be
that
i
shall
have
to
eat
nothing
but
mush
and
apple
sauce
for
my
dinner
and
all
alone
ah
she
began
to
sing
in
her
sweet
child
voice
one
of
the
hymns
that
she
had
learned
at
the
big
white
the
lord
is
both
my
health
and
light
shall
men
make
me
dismayed
since
god
doth
give
me
strength
and
might
why
should
i
be
afraid
as
she
sang
remember
lifted
a
bucket
of
soft
soap
that
stood
on
the
cellar
floor
and
tugged
it
up
to
the
kitchen
then
she
went
to
work
with
a
will
several
days
passed
before
remember
had
cleaned
the
house
to
her
satisfaction
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
scoured
the
floors
her
rosy
hands
and
arms
drenched
with
the
foaming
soapsuds
afterward
she
sprinkled
sand
upon
the
spotless
boards
in
pretty
patterns
as
was
the
fashion
in
those
days
she
swept
the
brick
hearth
with
a
broom
made
of
twigs
and
she
scoured
the
pewter
and
copper
utensils
until
they
were
as
bright
as
so
many
mirrors
she
washed
the
wooden
chairs
until
the
bunch
of
cherries
painted
upon
the
back
of
each
looked
bright
enough
to
pick
and
eat
she
dusted
the
straight
chairs
and
the
settle
that
stood
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
even
the
tall
clock
in
the
corner
had
its
round
glass
face
washed
then
remember
stood
in
the
center
of
the
kitchen
looking
at
the
good
result
of
her
work
my
mother
herself
could
have
done
no
better
she
thought
then
she
looked
at
the
keg
that
had
held
their
precious
store
of
soft
soap
there
was
no
soap
to
be
bought
in
those
days
the
puritans
were
obliged
to
make
their
own
i
have
used
up
all
the
soap
oh
what
will
my
mother
say
at
such
waste
what
shall
i
do
remember
said
in
dismay
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
thought
suddenly
she
jumped
up
a
happy
plan
had
come
to
her
i
will
make
a
mess
of
soap
remember
said
to
herself
i
have
helped
mother
to
make
soap
many
a
time
and
i
can
do
no
more
than
try
it
is
yet
some
days
until
thanksgiving
and
i
should
be
sadly
idle
with
nothing
more
to
do
now
that
the
house
is
put
so
well
in
the
barrel
a
hole
bored
in
the
bottom
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
cellar
it
was
light
enough
so
that
remember
could
easily
handle
it
and
she
was
strong
for
her
twelve
summers
and
winters
in
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
she
put
a
layer
of
clean
fresh
straw
from
the
shed
and
over
this
she
filled
the
barrel
as
far
as
she
could
with
wood
ashes
then
she
rolled
and
tugged
and
lifted
the
barrel
to
a
high
bench
that
stood
by
the
kitchen
door
taking
care
that
the
hole
was
just
above
a
large
empty
bucket
then
remember
brought
pails
of
water
and
standing
on
a
stool
poured
the
water
into
the
barrel
until
it
began
to
drip
down
through
the
ashes
and
the
straw
into
the
bucket
below
it
looked
rather
dirty
as
it
filtered
down
into
the
bucket
but
remember
took
good
care
not
to
touch
it
with
her
fingers
for
she
knew
that
it
had
turned
into
lye
late
in
the
afternoon
remember
took
out
a
hen
s
egg
and
dropped
it
into
the
bucket
to
see
what
would
happen
illustration
remember
brought
pails
of
water
it
floats
she
said
now
i
am
sure
that
i
made
the
lye
right
and
i
can
attend
to
the
grease
remember
had
to
start
a
huge
fire
the
next
day
and
she
got
out
the
great
black
soap
kettle
filled
it
with
the
lye
and
hung
it
over
the
fire
into
this
she
put
many
scraps
of
meat
fat
and
waste
grease
that
her
mother
had
been
saving
for
just
such
a
emergency
as
this
it
bubbled
and
boiled
and
remember
carefully
skimmed
from
the
top
all
the
bones
and
skin
and
pieces
of
candle
wicking
that
rose
as
the
lye
absorbed
the
grease
and
cooked
it
into
a
thick
ropy
mixture
it
looked
very
much
like
molasses
candy
as
it
boiled
and
after
a
while
remember
knew
that
it
was
done
she
lifted
the
kettle
off
the
fire
and
poured
the
thick
brown
jelly
that
was
now
good
soft
soap
into
big
earthenware
crocks
to
cool
i
made
the
soap
quite
as
well
as
my
mother
could
remember
said
to
herself
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
as
she
put
the
crocks
all
save
one
in
the
cellar
this
one
she
kept
for
use
in
the
kitchen
there
s
not
another
thing
that
i
can
think
of
to
do
remember
said
now
she
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
bleak
bare
fields
behind
which
the
november
sun
was
just
preparing
to
set
in
a
ball
here
it
is
the
afternoon
before
thanksgiving
day
and
mother
and
father
are
not
home
yet
and
we
haven
t
anything
in
the
house
for
a
thanksgiving
dinner
she
looked
toward
the
woods
now
what
was
that
a
speck
of
color
that
she
could
see
in
the
narrow
footpath
between
the
trees
suddenly
came
nearer
growing
larger
and
brighter
all
the
time
remember
could
distinguish
the
gaudy
blanket
bright
moccasins
and
feather
headdress
of
an
indian
stalking
across
the
field
he
was
fast
approaching
their
little
log
house
which
he
could
easily
see
from
the
woods
and
which
seemed
to
offer
him
an
easy
goal
remember
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
trying
in
her
terror
to
think
what
to
do
the
bolt
on
the
kitchen
door
was
but
a
flimsy
protection
at
best
remember
knew
that
the
indian
would
be
able
to
wrench
it
off
with
one
tug
of
his
brawny
arm
she
knew
too
that
it
had
been
the
custom
of
the
indians
who
were
encamped
not
far
off
to
take
the
children
of
the
colonists
and
hold
them
for
a
high
ransom
the
white
face
takes
our
lands
we
take
the
papoose
of
the
white
face
they
had
threatened
and
they
were
cruel
indeed
to
the
children
whom
they
held
especially
if
their
parents
were
a
long
time
supplying
the
necessary
ransom
but
it
had
been
so
long
now
since
an
indian
had
been
seen
in
their
little
settlement
that
remember
s
mother
had
felt
quite
safe
in
leaving
her
remember
looked
now
for
a
place
to
hide
there
was
none
the
cellar
would
be
the
first
place
she
knew
where
the
indian
would
look
for
her
the
tall
clock
was
too
small
a
space
into
which
to
squeeze
her
fat
little
body
and
there
was
no
use
hiding
under
the
bed
for
she
would
be
dragged
out
at
once
remember
turned
now
hearing
a
footstep
the
indian
big
brown
and
frowning
had
crossed
the
threshold
and
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
his
blanket
trailed
the
floor
over
his
shoulder
was
slung
a
pair
of
wild
turkeys
he
had
killed
remember
trembled
but
she
faced
him
bravely
how
she
said
reaching
out
a
kind
little
hand
to
him
the
indian
shook
his
head
and
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
with
the
little
girl
instead
he
pointed
to
the
door
motioning
to
her
that
she
was
to
follow
him
remember
s
mind
worked
quickly
she
knew
that
indians
were
fond
of
trinkets
and
could
sometimes
be
turned
away
from
their
cruel
designs
by
means
of
very
small
gifts
she
ran
to
her
mother
s
work
basket
and
offered
him
in
succession
a
pair
of
scissors
a
case
of
bright
new
needles
a
scarlet
pincushion
and
a
silver
thimble
each
in
turn
the
indian
refused
shaking
his
head
and
still
indicating
by
his
gestures
that
remember
was
to
follow
him
now
he
grasped
the
little
girl
s
hand
and
tried
to
pull
her
there
was
no
use
resisting
but
just
as
they
reached
the
door
the
indian
caught
sight
of
the
crock
of
soft
sticky
and
strangely
fascinating
to
him
he
stuck
one
long
brown
finger
in
it
and
started
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
but
remember
reached
up
and
pulled
his
hand
away
she
shook
her
head
and
made
a
wry
face
to
show
him
that
it
was
not
good
to
eat
how
he
questioned
pointing
to
the
soap
remember
pulled
from
his
grasp
pouring
a
dipperful
of
water
in
a
basin
she
took
a
handful
of
the
soap
and
showed
the
indian
how
she
could
wash
her
hands
as
he
watched
a
look
first
of
wonder
and
then
of
pleasure
crept
into
his
face
he
smiled
and
looked
at
his
own
hands
they
were
stained
with
earth
and
sadly
in
need
of
washing
remember
refilled
the
basin
with
water
and
the
indian
helping
himself
to
a
huge
handful
of
the
soap
washed
his
hands
solemnly
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
ceremony
illustration
the
indian
helping
himself
to
a
huge
handful
of
the
soap
washed
his
hands
solemnly
as
remember
watched
him
her
heart
beat
fast
indeed
as
soon
as
he
finishes
he
will
take
me
away
she
thought
slowly
the
indian
dried
his
hands
on
the
towel
she
gave
him
then
he
picked
up
the
crock
of
soft
soap
he
set
it
on
his
shoulder
pointing
to
the
pair
of
turkeys
that
he
had
laid
on
the
table
to
show
that
he
was
giving
them
to
remember
in
exchange
for
the
soap
he
strode
out
of
the
door
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
in
the
wood
s
path
remember
dropped
down
in
a
chair
and
could
scarcely
believe
she
was
really
safe
a
quick
clatter
of
hoofs
roused
her
she
darted
to
the
door
father
mother
she
cried
yes
it
was
indeed
they
her
father
riding
in
front
with
her
mother
in
the
saddle
behind
just
in
time
for
thanksgiving
they
cried
as
they
jumped
down
and
embraced
remember
and
i
m
here
too
and
we
have
a
pair
of
turkeys
for
dinner
remember
said
half
smiles
and
half
tears
as
she
told
them
her
strange
adventure
the
beacon
tree
if
you
will
but
help
me
hannah
as
a
little
girl
of
ten
should
with
the
candle
dipping
you
will
forget
to
fret
all
the
day
long
about
the
home
coming
of
father
and
nathaniel
mistress
wadsworth
said
laying
a
kind
hand
on
the
bent
head
of
the
little
daughter
all
through
the
long
gray
afternoon
hannah
had
looked
out
of
the
panes
of
the
window
past
the
fields
of
dried
cornstalks
that
looked
as
if
they
were
peopled
with
ghosts
in
their
garments
of
snow
and
toward
the
forest
of
pointed
green
firs
beyond
she
turned
from
the
window
now
as
her
mother
spoke
to
her
and
looked
up
bravely
trying
to
smile
you
are
quite
as
anxious
about
dear
brother
nathaniel
and
father
as
i
am
she
said
it
is
now
two
weeks
since
they
started
away
with
the
sledge
to
bring
us
back
the
wood
for
the
winter
father
said
that
it
would
take
him
no
longer
than
ten
days
at
the
utmost
brother
nathaniel
is
only
twelve
and
young
for
so
hard
a
journey
there
have
been
storms
and
there
are
a
sob
caught
the
little
girl
s
voice
it
was
mistress
wadsworth
s
turn
to
look
out
now
with
saddened
eyes
through
the
window
and
into
the
falling
twilight
of
the
new
england
winter
your
father
said
that
he
would
be
home
for
christmas
day
she
said
and
he
will
keep
his
word
unless
some
ill
befalls
them
in
the
meantime
we
will
make
the
candles
then
the
house
will
be
brighter
to
welcome
them
than
when
we
burn
only
pine
knots
hannah
we
will
measure
the
candle
wicking
for
we
shall
be
busy
the
greater
part
of
with
the
as
the
two
both
mother
and
little
daughter
dressed
in
the
long
straight
frocks
of
dark
homespun
and
the
white
caps
that
were
worn
in
those
days
bent
over
the
pine
table
after
supper
they
looked
very
much
alike
the
fire
in
the
great
brick
fireplace
had
a
sticky
pitchy
lump
of
fire
wood
upon
the
top
it
was
a
pine
knot
and
the
only
light
in
the
room
it
flickered
upon
the
bright
rag
rugs
of
the
floor
and
the
painted
chairs
with
their
scoured
rush
seats
and
on
the
green
settle
making
a
pleasant
cheerful
glow
they
tried
not
to
hear
the
wind
that
howled
down
the
chimney
or
think
of
the
beloved
father
and
little
brother
who
were
so
far
away
in
a
bleak
lumber
clearing
measuring
the
wicks
for
the
tallow
candles
was
so
painstaking
a
task
that
mistress
wadsworth
did
it
herself
hannah
standing
beside
her
only
watched
she
stuck
an
old
iron
fork
straight
up
in
the
soft
wood
of
the
table
some
eight
inches
from
the
edge
around
it
she
threw
half
a
dozen
loops
of
the
soft
candle
wicking
she
cut
these
loops
off
evenly
at
the
edge
of
the
table
then
she
measured
and
cut
more
until
she
had
made
several
dozen
all
exactly
the
same
length
as
she
worked
they
talked
together
of
what
hannah
most
loved
to
hear
about
christmas
in
her
dear
mother
s
girlhood
home
merry
england
they
had
polished
brass
sconces
fastened
everywhere
to
the
walls
mistress
wadsworth
said
she
could
almost
see
the
bright
scene
in
the
dim
shadows
cast
by
the
pine
knots
in
every
sconce
there
would
be
tall
white
candles
we
burned
more
candles
in
a
night
then
than
we
can
afford
to
burn
in
a
month
now
she
sighed
and
there
was
a
fir
tree
from
the
forest
brought
into
the
hall
for
the
children
hannah
continued
for
she
knew
the
story
well
there
were
candles
on
the
tree
lighted
and
shining
oh
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
children
dance
about
the
christmas
tree
and
sing
their
carols
we
never
have
christmas
trees
with
candles
in
this
new
land
do
we
mother
why
she
asked
the
governor
decrees
that
we
shall
not
continue
the
customs
of
the
land
that
we
have
left
so
far
behind
mistress
wadsworth
replied
but
with
another
sigh
and
now
to
bed
little
daughter
for
we
shall
be
busy
indeed
on
the
when
morning
came
hannah
found
that
her
mother
had
worked
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
twisting
and
doubling
each
candle
wick
and
slipping
through
the
loop
a
candle
rod
this
rod
was
a
stick
like
a
lead
pencil
but
over
three
times
as
long
six
wicks
hung
from
each
rod
they
looked
hannah
thought
as
if
they
were
so
many
little
clothes
lines
then
the
big
iron
kettle
filled
with
clean
white
tallow
was
swung
on
a
heavy
iron
hook
in
the
fireplace
as
the
tallow
melted
mistress
wadsworth
directed
hannah
as
she
tipped
down
two
straight
backed
chairs
and
placed
two
long
poles
across
them
like
the
sides
of
a
ladder
with
no
rungs
across
these
were
laid
the
candle
rods
with
their
hanging
wicks
then
the
kettle
was
taken
from
the
fire
and
set
on
the
wide
hearth
and
the
pleasant
task
of
the
candle
dipping
was
begun
one
at
a
time
hannah
took
the
candle
rods
carefully
by
their
ends
and
dipped
the
wicks
for
a
second
in
the
melted
tallow
then
she
put
it
back
between
the
chairs
to
dry
and
took
up
another
rod
dipping
the
wicks
in
the
same
way
when
the
last
wicks
had
been
dipped
the
first
ones
were
dry
enough
to
dip
again
with
each
dipping
the
candles
grew
plump
and
straight
and
white
one
candle
rod
though
hannah
dipped
only
once
in
every
three
times
when
her
mother
noticed
this
she
said
little
daughter

of
the
candles

hannah
dipped
the
wicks
for
a
second
in
the
melted
tallow
hannah
ran
over
threw
her
arms
about
her
mother
s
neck
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
mistress
wadsworth
shook
her
head
at
first
then
she
smiled
it
can
do
no
harm
that
i
see
she
said
it
will
be
only
a
child
s
play
before
christmas
and
no
cause
for
the
governor
s
displeasure
yes
little
daughter
if
you
wish
if
it
brings
joy
to
your
sorrowful
heart
i
shall
be
when
the
candle
dipping
was
over
and
the
precious
candles
were
laid
away
to
be
burned
only
if
the
father
and
little
nathaniel
came
home
hannah
slipped
six
as
small
as
christmas
tree
candles
from
one
rod
and
wrapped
them
carefully
in
a
bit
of
fair
white
linen
they
were
her
little
candles
to
be
used
as
she
wished
the
days
white
with
snow
and
very
cold
wore
on
until
it
was
only
a
week
before
the
blessed
christmas
day
there
were
slight
preparations
for
it
in
the
little
new
england
settlement
where
hannah
lived
for
it
was
not
thought
fitting
to
be
merry
and
gay
at
christmas
time
these
centuries
ago
but
at
the
small
white
hannah
and
the
other
little
colonist
children
practised
a
carol
to
be
sung
on
christmas
day
shout
to
jehovah
all
the
earth
serve
ye
jehovah
with
gladness
before
him
bow
singing
with
the
children
sang
it
as
it
was
pitched
by
the
elder
s
tuning
fork
and
the
tune
was
slow
and
dirge
like
the
tears
came
again
to
hannah
s
eyes
as
she
tried
to
sing
for
no
word
had
come
as
yet
of
father
and
nathaniel
a
runner
to
the
village
brought
word
a
few
days
before
of
attacks
by
the
indians
on
parties
of
wood
cutters
could
they
have
encountered
the
party
with
whom
were
father
and
nathaniel
she
thought
illustration
the
town
crier
but
hannah
s
secret
kept
her
happy
a
few
days
before
christmas
she
went
to
a
bit
of
woodland
she
carried
the
old
hatchet
that
nathaniel
had
left
at
home
and
she
looked
over
the
young
fir
trees
until
she
found
one
that
was
well
shaped
tiny
and
as
green
as
green
could
be
she
chopped
and
hacked
at
the
roots
until
she
cut
down
the
little
tree
then
she
tugged
it
home
as
she
held
its
prickly
needles
close
to
her
warm
cloak
she
whispered
you
are
not
to
bear
gifts
little
christmas
tree
because
that
would
not
be
right
only
candles
to
light
the
way
home
for
dear
father
and
brother
at
last
it
was
three
days
before
christmas
and
evening
in
the
little
new
england
village
the
town
crier
had
taken
his
way
through
the
narrow
main
street
early
in
the
afternoon
dismal
enough
looking
figure
in
his
long
black
cloak
and
tall
black
hat
and
ringing
his
bell
lost
in
all
probability
lost
he
called
this
christmas
time
and
then
he
gave
the
toll
of
names
of
the
men
and
boys
who
had
started
out
so
many
weeks
before
on
the
lumber
trip
and
from
whom
no
word
had
come
as
he
reached
the
names
goodman
wadsworth
little
nathaniel
wadsworth
mistress
wadsworth
cowered
in
front
of
the
fire
her
bowed
head
in
her
hands
but
hannah
kissed
her
gently
for
comfort
and
took
out
the
little
tallow
candles
that
she
had
dipped
then
she
set
up
the
tiny
fir
tree
with
the
lighted
christmas
candles
in
front
of
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
the
main
street
now
the
village
was
black
with
the
night
the
fires
were
low
and
the
barred
doors
and
windows
shut
in
hannah
s
and
her
mother
s
sadness
the
long
street
was
white
with
snow
a
few
glimmering
stars
shed
a
fitful
path
of
light
down
it
but
the
houses
were
like
so
many
eyes
they
could
hardly
be
seen
at
all
illustration
the
little
white
boy
had
printed
strange
characters
it
was
almost
ten
o
clock
when
an
indian
boy
little
like
a
flash
of
color
in
the
dark
of
the
night
darted
down
the
street
he
was
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
his
scarlet
blanket
he
was
panting
his
bare
limbs
were
cold
he
had
come
a
long
long
way
without
food
since
morning
but
he
did
not
stop
running
now
that
he
was
nearing
his
goal
the
dim
little
town
frightened
him
though
he
had
never
been
in
so
strange
a
place
before
the
home
that
little
knew
was
a
wide
plain
with
a
background
of
forests
his
house
was
a
painted
wigwam
and
his
light
was
a
camp
fire
but
he
pressed
against
his
heart
a
bit
of
white
birch
bark
upon
which
a
little
white
boy
of
his
own
age
brought
to
the
camp
a
captive
with
a
band
of
prisoners
had
printed
strange
characters
it
was
not
like
the
picture
writing
of
the
tribe
but
it
must
be
important
for
all
that
knew
the
little
white
boy
whom
this
little
indian
boy
had
grown
to
love
like
his
own
brother
had
begged
him
to
carry
the
writing
to
his
mother
go
to
the
north
he
had
said
so
had
watched
the
moss
on
the
trees
and
followed
the
north
star
here
he
was
but
how
could
he
tell
in
which
of
all
these
strange
wigwams
the
mother
of
his
little
white
friend
lived
suddenly
s
dark
eyes
flashed
into
a
smile
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
bright
light
attracted
him
he
ran
on
bravely
following
it
of
all
the
windows
in
the
whole
village
this
was
the
only
one
that
was
unbarred
and
where
the
curtains
were
parted
as
he
came
nearer
the
light
s
heart
almost
stopped
beating
for
admiration
and
wonder
never
in
all
his
twelve
years
had
the
little
indian
boy
seen
a
sight
like
this
it
was
an
evergreen
tree
such
as
he
knew
and
loved
in
his
own
home
forest
but
it
was
covered
with
glimmering
sparkling
starry
lights
there
it
stood
hannah
s
christmas
tree
the
little
tallow
candles
drawing
with
nathaniel
s
message
like
a
magnet
illustration
he
beat
the
heavy
oak
panels
with
his
brown
little
hands
he
stopped
at
the
door
and
beat
the
heavy
oak
panels
with
his
brown
little
hands
when
mistress
wadsworth
followed
closely
by
hannah
opened
it
frightened
and
dazed
at
the
strange
visit
in
the
night
looked
at
them
a
minute
on
the
threshold
in
the
light
of
the
little
christmas
tree
he
could
see
hannah
s
pink
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
and
the
pale
gold
braids
of
her
hair
why
she
looked
like
the
boy
that
he
had
left
in
the
indian
s
camp
saw
he
knew
now
that
he
had
found
the
right
place
he
went
inside
and
pulled
the
message
written
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
in
scrawling
letters
on
the
square
of
birch
bark
from
beneath
his
blanket
then
he
thrust
it
into
mistress
wadsworth
s
hands
she
read
it
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
we
are
safe
but
the
indians
will
not
let
us
go
without
gifts
of
beads
and
corn
send
some
men
to
fetch
us
your
son
with
a
glad
cry
mistress
wadsworth
put
her
arms
about
the
little
indian
boy
then
while
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
lighted
the
big
brass
lantern
hannah
drew
up
to
the
fire
and
brought
him
food
running
with
her
lantern
from
one
sleeping
house
to
another
mistress
wadsworth
soon
roused
the
men
of
the
village
who
organized
themselves
into
a
rescuing
party
when
the
first
pale
pink
of
the
morning
sun
tinged
the
sky
the
party
with
the
gifts
which
the
indians
demanded
as
a
ransom
for
their
captives
was
on
its
way
they
carried
little
in
front
as
their
guide
such
a
christmas
eve
as
it
was
father
and
nathaniel
ragged
and
hungry
but
safe
were
home
in
time
two
of
the
large
tallow
candles
in
the
polished
brass
candlesticks
shone
on
the
mantelpiece
over
the
fireplace
and
hannah
lighted
the
little
christmas
tree
again
she
and
brother
nathaniel
hands
clasped
happily
together
sat
in
its
light
so
glad
to
be
together
again
that
they
needed
neither
gifts
nor
sweets
to
make
their
christmas
joy
the
witch
the
grim
iron
doors
of
the
prison
clanged
shut
and
the
turnkey
fastened
them
hearing
the
sound
desire
touched
the
homespun
sleeve
of
the
little
boy
with
whom
she
was
walking
home
from
market
down
the
narrow
street
of
the
musty
old
town
of
salem
did
you
hear
that
sound
of
the
locking
of
the
doors
jonathan
it
means
that
they
ve
caught
and
imprisoned
another
the
boy
a
quaint
little
figure
in
his
long
trousers
short
jacket
and
ruffled
shirt
looked
at
the
little
girl
quite
as
strangely
dressed
a
child
as
jonathan
was
small
desire
the
only
daughter
of
elder
baxter
who
was
high
in
authority
in
old
salem
in
those
days
although
not
quite
twelve
summers
and
winters
of
the
new
england
of

painted
desire
s
plump
cheeks
the
pink
of
a
rose
and
burned
the
shining
gold
of
her
hair
her
gray
frock
with
its
short
waist
and
long
skirt
nearly
trailed
the
gray
cobble
stones
of
the
street
her
soft
brown
hair
was
braided
close
to
her
head
and
pulled
back
tightly
in
front
from
her
white
brow
and
tucked
out
of
sight
beneath
her
stiff
cap
a
white
kerchief
was
folded
closely
about
her
primly
held
shoulders
and
over
her
frock
she
wore
a
long
dark
cape
for
the
fall

was
chill

do
you
know
who
the
witch
is

he
asked
jonathan

down
the
rush
basket
of
food
supplies
that
he
was
carrying
for
desire
and
he
touched
the
iron
paling
that
shut
in
the
prison
do
you
know
who
the
witch
is
desire
he
asked
his
voice
low
with
awe
not
i
the
little
maid
answered
but
they
do
say
that
she
has
been
brewing
her
spells
for
six
months
time
before
the
elders
caught
her
i
heard
my
father
and
mother
talking
about
it
only
this
morning
they
said
that
before
the
day
was
over
the
witch
that
was
the
cause
of
all
our
recent
troubles
in
salem
would
be
caught
and
safely
what
troubles
jonathan
asked
have
you
not
heard
jonathan
desire
lowered
her
voice
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
to
see
that
no
one
was
listening
to
her
abigail
williams
was
ill
of
the
whooping
cough
and
she
had
three
fits
which
as
every
one
knows
is
a
sign
that
a
witch
had
cast
a
spell
over
her
and
mercy
talcott
s
teakettle
boiled
over
and
nearly
scalded
mercy
s
mother
on
the
way
for
some
ointment
at
the
doctor
s
to
put
on
her
mother
s
hand
mercy
saw
the
witch
herself
flying
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
on
gallows
hill
and
desire
s
voice
was
a
whisper
now
she
was
riding
on
a
how
did
mercy
know
that
it
was
a
witch
and
how
could
she
be
riding
on
a
broomstick
asked
the
practical
jonathan
desire
tossed
her
head
i
can
t
explain
that
to
you
jonathan
it
was
toward
evening
and
mercy
says
that
she
saw
a
long
dark
form
in
the
trees
and
she
heard
the
dry
leaves
crows
said
jonathan
for
shame
jonathan
said
desire
do
you
not
know
that
the
eyes
of
mercy
talcott
are
keen
for
seeing
witches
she
is
to
be
at
the
trial
and
identify
the
evil
desire
repeated
the
words
of
her
elders
in
those
colonial
days
of
ignorance
and
superstition
when
shall
we
rid
ourselves
of
this
pest
of
witchcraft
in
salem
she
said
well
jonathan
said
swinging
the
basket
upon
his
shoulder
and
leading
the
way
along
the
street
again
there
ll
probably
be
one
less
witch
for
she
won
t
have
a
chance
to
escape
if
that
mercy
talcott
is
at
the
trial
let
us
go
on
by
the
side
street
and
see
if
jack
is
safe
at
granny
hewitt
s
the
two
children
hastened
their
steps
and
passed
the
scattering
little
brown
houses
of
old
salem
their
quaintly
gabled
roofs
made
them
look
like
dolls
cottages
the
windows
with
their
tiny
panes
were
neatly
curtained
with
white
at
one
house
a
little
larger
than
the
others
and
having
no
garden
they
drew
their
breath
the
witches
house
said
desire
it
was
here
that
so
many
of
these
unfortunate
creatures
of
the
dark
days
of
salem
had
been
kept
in
confinement
before
they
met
their
punishment
in
prison
on
the
ducking
stool
or
on
gallows
hill
a
little
farther
along
they
passed
a
great
white
meetinghouse
where
a
gilded
weathercock
pointed
bravely
to
the
sky
and
high
white
pillars
stood
at
either
side
of
the
doorway
the
witch
will
be
tried
here
in
the
morning
jonathan
said
and
the
two
children
walked
a
little
faster
toward
a
pleasanter
stopping
place
governor
endicott
s
big
white
house
set
in
the
midst
of
his
fair
english
garden
even
now
when
the
wind
blew
cold
from
the
water
front
and
rustled
the
cornstalks
and
rattled
the
red
pods
of
the
rose
hips
the
governor
s
garden
was
a
pleasant
place
for
a
child
to
see
bright
little
marigolds
defying
the
frost
lifted
their
orange
blossoms
along
the
path
great
beds
of
scarlet
dahlias
and
purple
asters
made
a
mass
of
color
the
late
sun
marked
for
itself
a
long
golden
shaft
across
the
sundial
and
at
the
back
of
the
house
could
be
seen
a
patch
of
winter
squashes
and
pumpkins
mellowing
in
a
sunny
spot
was
not
the
governor
kind
to
give
us
the
pumpkin
said
jonathan
and
wasn
t
granny
kind
to
show
us
how
to
make
it
into
so
strange
a
hobgoblin
of
a
creature
as
is
our
jack
added
desire
she
said
that
almost
no
other
granny
in
old
salem
was
old
enough
to
remember
about
carving
a
pumpkin
into
a
face
as
they
did
long
ago
in
england
she
told
me
that
we
must
keep
it
a
secret
until
all
hallow
e
en
and
then
take
the
pumpkin
with
a
tallow
drip
shining
inside
him
lighting
his
funny
face
down
through
the
street
to
show
the
other
i
lighted
it
last
night
jonathan
confessed
i
went
to
granny
s
house
with
a
cheese
ball
that
was
a
gift
from
my
mother
to
how
did
the
pumpkin
look
asked
desire
eagerly
fearsome
said
jonathan
we
put
it
in
the
window
and
i
went
outside
in
the
dark
to
look
at
it
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
grinning
monster
the
boy
laughed
at
his
memory
of
the
here
we
are
at
granny
s
let
us
go
in
a
moment
desire
said
as
the
two
stopped
before
a
cottage
at
the
end
of
a
tiny
lane
granny
hewitt
lived
alone
there
a
little
wrinkled
crone
with
a
face
like
a
brown
walnut
and
eyes
that
shone
like
two
stars
but
her
mouth
oh
that
was
the
best
part
of
granny
all
the
children
said
that
it
made
them
think
of
their
own
dear
mother
s
when
she
smiled
how
could
a
smile
be
lovelier
than
that
having
no
kin
of
her
own
granny
hewitt
loved
the
boys
and
girls
who
passed
her
cottage
every
day
on
their
way
to
and
from
school
she
made
molasses
cookies
and
vinegar
taffy
for
them
she
put
balm
on
their
scratches
and
covered
their
primers
and
spellers
with
pieces
of
bright
calico
no
wonder
desire
and
jonathan
wanted
to
stop
a
moment
at
granny
hewitt
s
house
they
went
up
the
white
gravel
path
with
its
neat
border
of
clam
shells
desire
lifted
the
big
brass
knocker
on
the
door
letting
it
drop
with
a
clang
illustration
granny
hewitt
loved
the
boys
and
girls
there
was
no
sound
inside
she
has
gone
to
market
jonathan
said
well
jonathan
desire
said
taking
her
basket
from
the
boy
s
hands
i
probably
shall
not
see

that

father
will

in
our
pew

the
during

eyes

popped
out
of
his
head
in
surprise

asked

see
if
i
can
get
you
in
desire
promised
as
the
two
friends
parted
the
morning
of
the
witch
s
trial
was
as
bright
and
peaceful
as
the
fall
sun
lighting
field
and
dingy
streets
and
roofs
could
make
it
by
seven
although
the
trial
was
not
to
begin
until
ten
the
green
common
that
surrounded
the
second
was
a
moving
black
and
gray
mass
of
stern
men
in
their
dark
capes
buckled
shoes
and
tall
hats
and
women
inside
the
every
pew
was
filled
the
platform
was
lined
with
the
elders
and
the
governor
himself
a
dignified
figure
in
his
flowing
cloak
and
powdered
wig
occupied
the
pulpit
desire
sat
prim
and
quiet
beside
her
mother
her
little
round
head
not
much
above
the
high
back
of
the
pew
on
the
other
side
sat
jonathan
whose
urgent
request
to
come
had
been
granted
it
was
rumored
that
the
witch
who
was
about
to
be
tried
was
of
some
repute
in
the
practice
of
magic
and
that
she
was
to
be
made
an
example
for
any
followers
whom
she
might
have
jonathan
nudged
desire
s
elbow
where
is
she
he
asked
the
little
girl

a
warning
finger
to
her
lips
they
ll
bring
her
out
in
a
as
she
finished
her
whispered
warning
her
father
elder
baxter
rose
and
began
to
speak
we
are
met
together
to
pass
judgment
upon
a
woman
of
salem
town
who
has
wrought
her
magic
arts
to
the
undoing
of
its
citizens
she
has
cast
her
spell
over
a
child
and
thrown
it
into
dire
sickness
she
has
bewitched
the
kitchen
of
our
neighbor
elder
talcott
a
child
of
twelve
years
and
well
versed
in
the
art
of
discovering
witchcraft
saw
this
same
witch
after
she
had
practised
her
arts
mercy
talcott
will
please
come
to
the
platform
bring
in
the
desire
and
jonathan
craned
their
necks
to
see
better
as
the
black
row
of
the
elders
parted
to
let
in
a
bent
trembling
little
old
lady
two
jailers
guarded
her
one
on
each
side
she
still
wore
her
tidy
white
apron
with
its
knitting
pocket
and
her
white
cap
was
tied
neatly
under
her
chin
she
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
her
fright
her
head
was
bent
low
so
that
no
one
could
see
her
face
she
held
her
bible
clasped
closely
to
her
heart
at
the
same
time
mercy
talcott
a
little
girl
dressed
like
desire
but
with
a
less
winning
face
stepped
up
also
to
the
platform
it
was
the
custom
of
those
strange
days
to
believe
that
certain
children
could
identify
witches
and
mercy
was
one
of
these
children
the
elder
spoke
again
i
have
not
made
one
most
important
charge
of
all
as
i
wish
to
make
it
in
the
presence
of
the
prisoner
herself
she
has
a
creature
of
some
other
kind
than
human
with
whom
she
consults
on
matters
of
witchery
it
has
been
seen
at
night
looking
out
of
her
window
with
glaring
eyes
and
mouth
set
in
its
huge
head
look
up
witch
mercy
talcott
is
this
the
witch
that
you
saw
leaving
your
house
the
day
that
your
mother
was
burned
slowly
and
in
terror
the
little
old
lady
lifted
her
head
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
sobbing
breaths
jonathan
and
desire
said
it
is
granny
hewitt
mercy
saw
too
who
it
was
she
remembered
the
little
rag
doll
that
granny
had
made
her
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
it
wore
a
gay
pink
calico
dress
and
its
cheeks
were
stained
red
with
pokeberry
juice
mercy
caught
her
breath
and
hesitated
she
knew
that
it
was
only
in
fancy
that
she
had
seen
the
broomstick
and
its
wild
rider
as
she
waited
desire
pulled
jonathan
from
his
seat
before
her
mother
could
question
or
stop
them
the
two
children
were
at
the
front
of
the
pulpit
facing
the
governor
desire
clasped
her
hands
and
raised
them
in
pleading
toward
the
great
man
who
bent
down
toward
her
in
surprise
the
whole
was
still
as
desire
spoke
in
her
sweet
high
voice
your
excellency
i
beg
your
mercy
for
our
dear
granny
she
is
not
a
witch
but
a
kind
friend
to
all
the
children
of
salem
it
is
i
who
should
be
punished
in
her
place
if
your
excellency
will
but
think
back
to
the
last
tithing
day
you
will
remember
that
you
gave
two
children
jonathan
and
me
a
pumpkin
for
our
play
we
took
it
to
granny
hewitt
s
house
and
she
helped
us
to
make
it
into
a
jack
whose
tallow
drip
lighted
in
granny
s
window
some
one
saw
and
spoke
of
to
you
my
father
did
not
know
that
it
was
my
fault
else
he
would
not
have
accused
granny
oh
speak
jonathan
and
attest
to
the
truth
of
what
i
am
saying
she
turned
to
the
little
boy
but
jonathan
made
courageous
by
desire
s
bravery
had
gone
to
mercy
s
side
it
was
crows
you
saw
on
gallows
hill
he
said
in
her
ear
you
never
never
saw
granny
hewitt
riding
on
a
broomstick
say
mercy
looked
into
granny
s
face
then
with
a
rush
of
love
she
threw
herself
into
her
arms
i
never
saw
granny
riding
on
a
broomstick
she
isn
t
a
witch
mercy
declared
the
white
doors
of
the
opened
wide
and
the
people
waited
with
heads
bowed
half
in
shame
and
half
in
joy
as
granny
surrounded
by
the
children
passed
into
the
sunshine
and
the
freedom
outside
then
they
followed
making
a
kind
of
triumphal
procession
to
the
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
street
kind
hands
led
granny
all
the
way
and
kind
hearts
made
her
forget
all
about
her
experiences
in
her
window
there
still
stood
the
grinning
and
at
sight
of
it
bursts
of
laughter
took
away
all
thought
of
tears
one
of
the
elders
set
it
upon
one
of
granny
s
fence
posts
and
then
held
desire
up
beside
it
hurrah
for
the
witch
some
one
said
and
the
crowd
shouted
their
happiness
and
relief
illustration
the
witch
the
iron
stove
did
you
see
him
asked
a
little
girl
in
gray
all
excitement
as
she
opened
the
door
to
admit
her
brother
the
boy
shaking
with
the
it
was
winter
and
his
jacket
was
none
too
down
his
basket
on
the
rough
deal
table
and
leaned
over
the
tiny
fire
that
burned
on
the
hearth
his
eyes
shone
though
as
he
turned
to
answer
his
sister
yes
beth
i
saw
him
down
at
the
wharf
and
he
gave
me
as
he
spoke
william
drew
from
underneath
his
coat
where
he
had
tucked
it
to
surprise
beth
a
crude
little
brush
made
of
rushes
bound
together
with
narrow
strips
of
willow
what
is
it
beth
took
the
brush
in
her
hands
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
looking
at
it
curiously
she
made
a
quaint
picture
in
the
shifting
light
of
the
fire
a
little
quaker
girl
of
old
philadelphia
her
yellow
curls
tucked
inside
a
gray
cap
and
her
straight
gray
frock
reaching
almost
to
the
heels
of
her
heavy
shoes
it
is
something
new
for
cleaning
william
explained
he
took
the
brush
and
began
sweeping
up
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
as
beth
watched
him
curiously
mr
franklin
brought
a
whole
bunch
of
them
down
to
the
wharf
to
show
to
people
and
he
gave
me
how
did
he
make
it
beth
asked
curiously
it
took
him
a
whole
year
for
it
had
to
grow
first
william
explained
he
saw
some
brush
baskets
last
year
that
the
sea
captains
had
brought
fruit
in
lying
in
the
wet
on
the
wharf
they
had
sprouted
and
sent
out
shoots
so
what
did
franklin
do
but
plant
the
shoots
in
his
garden
they
grew
and
this
year
he
had
a
fine
crop
of
broom
corn
as
he
called
it
he
dried
it
and
bound
it
into
these
brushes
he
has
some
with
long
handles
and
he
calls
them
the
children
s
mother
had
come
in
now
from
the
next
room
and
she
grasped
the
hearth
brush
with
eagerness
it
is
just
what
philadelphia
the
city
of
cleanliness
needs
she
said
as
she
went
to
work
brushing
the
corners
of
the
window
sills
and
the
mantle
piece
if
we
were
to
take
more
thought
of
our
houses
and
less
of
these
street
brawls
as
to
who
is
for
and
who
is
against
the
king
it
would
be
that
is
what
franklin
does
william
said
do
you
remember
how
the
streets
were
full
of
quarreling
folk
last
summer
and
a
hard
thunder
storm
came
up
that
every
one
thought
was
sent
directly
from
the
skies
as
a
punishment
for
our
wickedness
the
women
and
children
were
crying
and
the
men
praying
when
franklin
came
in
their
midst
i
can
see
him
now
looking
like
a
prophet
with
his
long
hair
flowing
over
his
shoulders
and
his
long
cloak
streaming
out
behind
him
as
the
skies
flashed
with
lightning
and
the
thunder
crashed
he
told
them
not
to
be
afraid
he
said
that
he
would
give
them
lightning
rods
to
put
on
their
houses
that
would
keep
them
from
burning
yes
their
mother
said
he
helps
us
all
very
much
franklin
is
truly
our
good
neighbor
in
as
her
mother
finished
speaking
beth
emptied
the
basket
that
william
had
brought
in
there
was
not
a
great
deal
in
little
flour
some
tea
a
very
tiny
package
of
sugar
and
some
potatoes
she
arranged
them
on
the
shelves
in
the
kitchen
shivering
a
little
as
she
moved
about
the
cold
room
chill
comfort
it
would
seem
to
a
child
philadelphia
was
a
new
city
and
these
settlers
from
across
the
sea
had
brought
little
with
them
to
make
their
lives
cheerful
outside
huge
piles
of
snow
drifted
the
narrow
streets
and
were
banked
on
the
low
stone
doorsteps
of
the
small
red
brick
houses
a
chill
wind
blew
up
from
the
wharves
and
such
of
the
friends
as
were
out
hurried
along
with
bent
heads
against
which
the
cold
beat
and
they
wrapped
their
long
cloaks
closely
around
them
it
was
almost
as
cold
in
the
arnold
s
house
as
it
was
outside
the
children
s
father
had
not
been
able
to
stand
the
hardships
of
the
new
country
and
there
were
only
beth
and
william
and
their
mother
left
to
face
this
winter
arnold
did
fine
sewing
and
william
ran
errands
for
the
sailors
and
merchantmen
down
at
the
wharves
having
his
basket
filled
with
provisions
in
return
for
his
work
it
was
a
hard
winter
for
them
though
no
one
could
deny
that
arnold
drew
her
chair
up
to
the
fireplace
now
and
opened
her
bag
of
sewing
beth
leaned
over
her
shoulder
as
she
watched
the
thin
white
fingers
trying
to
fly
in
and
out
of
white
cloth
your
fingers
are
stiff
with
the
cold
beth
exclaimed
as
she
blew
the
coals
with
the
bellows
and
then
rubbed
her
mother
s
hands
not
very
she
tried
to
smile
yes
very
william
said
as
he
swung
his
arms
and
blew
on
his
finger
tips
we
re
all
of
us
cold
it
would
be
easier
to
work
if
we
could
only
keep
just
then
they
heard
a
rap
at
the
brass
knocker
of
their
door
beth
ran
to
open
it
and
both
children
shouted
with
delight
as
a
strange
slightly
stooping
figure
entered
his
long
white
hair
made
him
look
like
some
old
patriarch
his
forehead
was
high
and
his
eyes
deep
set
in
his
long
thin
face
his
long
cloak
folded
him
like
a
mantle
he
reached
out
two
hands
to
greet
the
family
mr
franklin
their
mother
exclaimed
we
are
most
glad
to
see
you
you
are
our
very
welcome
guest
always
but
it
is
poor
hospitality
we
are
able
to
offer
you
our
fire
is
very
small
and
the
house
a
small
fire
is
better
than
none
their
guest
said
and
the
welcome
in
friend
arnold
s
house
is
always
so
warm
that
it
makes
a
fire
unnecessary
still
he
looked
at
the
children
s
blue
lips
and
pinched
cheeks
i
wish
that
your
hearth
were
he
crossed
to
the
fireplace
feeling
of
the
bricks
and
measuring
with
his
eye
the
breadth
and
depth
of
the
opening
in
the
chimney
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
his
face
suddenly
shone
with
a
smile
like
the
one
it
had
worn
when
he
had
seen
the
first
green
shoots
of
the
broom
corn
pushing
their
way
up
through
the
ground
of
his
garden
what
is
it
franklin
beth
asked
what
do
you
see
up
in
our
chimney
a
surprise
the
good
neighbor
of
philadelphia
replied
if
i
make
no
mistake
in
my
plans
you
will
see
that
surprise
before
long
in
the
meantime
be
of
good
he
was
gone
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
but
he
had
left
a
glow
of
cheer
and
neighborliness
behind
him
all
philadelphia
was
warmed
in
this
way
by
benjamin
franklin
whenever
he
crossed
a
threshold
he
brought
the
spirit
of
comfort
and
helpfulness
to
the
house
what
do
you
suppose
he
meant
beth
asked
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
quaint
figure
of
the
man
i
wonder
william
said
then
he
took
out
his
speller
and
copy
book
and
the
words
of
their
visitor
were
soon
forgotten
but
all
philadelphia
began
to
wonder
soon
at
the
doings
at
the
big
white
house
where
benjamin
franklin
lived
the
neighbors
were
used
to
hearing
busy
sounds
of
hammering
and
tinkering
coming
from
the
back
where
franklin
had
built
himself
a
workshop
now
however
he
sent
away
for
a
small
forge
and
its
flying
sparks
could
be
seen
and
the
sound
of
its
bellows
heard
in
the
stillness
of
the
long
cold
winter
nights
great
slabs
of
iron
were
unloaded
for
him
at
the
wharf
and
for
days
no
one
saw
him
he
was
shut
up
in
his
workshop
and
from
morning
until
night
heard
ringing
blows
on
iron
coming
from
it
as
if
it
were
the
shop
of
some
country
blacksmith
benjamin
franklin
wastes
his
time
said
some
of
the
philadelphians
he
should
be
in
the
town
hall
helping
us
to
settle
some
of
our
land
but
others
spoke
more
kindly
of
the
man
of
helpful
hands
mr
franklin
is
making
philadelphia
truly
a
city
of
friends
by
being
the
best
friend
of
us
all
they
said
none
could
explain
benjamin
franklin
s
present
occupation
though
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
beth
and
william
and
their
mother
went
to
a
friend
s
house
to
stay
for
a
week
arnold
was
not
well
and
the
house
was
very
cold
the
week
for
which
they
were
invited
lengthened
into
two
then
three
we
must
go
home
arnold
said
at
last
mr
franklin
said
that
he
would
stop
this
afternoon
and
help
william
carry
the
carpet
bag
it
is
time
that
we
began
our
work
illustration
they
took
their
homeward
way
through
the
snow
as
they
took
their
homeward
way
through
the
snow
they
noticed
again
the
happy
smile
on
franklin
s
kind
face
he
held
the
handle
of
the
bag
with
one
hand
and
beth
s
chilly
little
fingers
with
the
other
he
was
the
spryest
of
them
all
as
they
hurried
on
they
understood
why
as
they
opened
the
door
of
their
home
they
started
at
first
wondering
if
by
any
chance
they
had
come
to
the
wrong
house
no
there
were
the
familiar
things
just
as
they
had
left
them
the
row
of
shining
copper
pans
on
the
wall
the
polished
candlesticks
on
the
mantel
piece
the
warming
pan
in
the
corner
and
the
braided
rag
rugs
on
the
floor
but
the
house
was
as
warm
as
summer
they
had
never
felt
such
comforting
heat
in
the
winter
time
before
the
fireplace
that
had
been
all
too
tiny
was
gone
in
its
place
against
the
chimney
was
a
crude
iron
stove
partly
like
a
fireplace
in
shape
but
with
a
top
and
sides
that
held
and
spread
the
heat
of
the
glowing
fire
inside
until
the
whole
room
glowed
with
it
illustration
the
first
stove
that
is
my
surprise
franklin
explained
rubbing
his
hands
with
pleasure
as
he
saw
the
wonder
and
delight
in
the
faces
of
the
others
an
iron
genie
to
drive
out
the
cold
and
frighten
away
the
frosts
you
can
cook
on
it
or
hang
the
kettle
over
the
coals
it
will
keep
the
coals
alive
all
night
and
not
eat
up
as
much
fuel
as
your
draughty
fireplace
did
this
is
my
winter
gift
to
my
dear
friend
oh
how
wonderful
how
can
we
thank
you
for
it
we
who
were
so
poor
are
the
richest
family
in
all
philadelphia
now
now
i
shall
be
able
to
work
the
children
s
mother
said
beth
and
william
put
out
their
hands
to
catch
the
friendly
warmth
of
the
fire
in
this
the
first
stove
in
the
city
of
friends
it
warmed
them
through
and
through
then
william
examined
its
rough
mechanism
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
tend
it
and
beth
bustled
about
the
room
filling
the
shining
brass
teakettle
and
putting
a
spoonful
of
tea
in
the
pot
to
draw
a
cup
for
their
mother
and
franklin
at
last
she
turned
to
him
her
blue
eyes
looking
deep
in
his
you
are
so
good
to
us
beth
said
why
did
you
work
so
hard
to
invent
and
make
this
iron
stove
for
us
the
kindest
friend
that
old
philadelphia
ever
had
stopped
a
second
to
think
he
never
knew
the
reason
for
his
good
deeds
they
were
as
natural
as
the
flowering
of
the
broom
corn
in
his
garden
at
last
he
spoke
because
of
your
warm
hearts
little
friend
he
said
not
that
they
needed
any
more
heat
but
that
you
may
see
their
glow
reflected
in
the
fires
you
kindle
in
my
and
so
may
we
feel
the
kindly
warmth
of
benjamin
franklin
s
heart
in
our
stoves
which
are
so
much
better
but
all
modelled
after
the
one
he
made
for
his
neighbors
in
the
quaker
city
of
long
ago
a
boston
tea
party
is
it
think
you
because
her
father
is
the
president
of
the
continental
congress
that
susan
boudinot
behaves
so
abigail
whispered
the
question
across
the
aisle
of
the
dame
s
school
in
old
boston
to
one
of
the
other
little
lassies
perhaps
that
is
it
look
at
her
now
she
minds
it
not
in
the
least
that
she
must
sit
in
the
dunce
s
corner
she
is
smiling
with
those
red
lips
and
big
blue
eyes
of
hers
as
though
she
were
not
in
disgrace
the
other
little
girl
whispered
back
from
other
corners
of
the
schoolroom
came
whispered
comments
about
the
wilful
little
susan
what
did
susan
do
that
she
was
put
in
the
dunce
s
corner
indeed
she
did
a
great
deal
to
try
the
good
dame
s
patience
she
tied
the
braids
of
mercy
wentworth
and
prudence
talbot
together
so
tightly
that
when
the
dame
called
upon
mercy
to
bring
her
copy
book
to
her
to
show
its
pothooks
prudence
was
well
nigh
dragged
too
as
if
this
were
not
enough
susan
put
sand
in
the
ink
and
made
it
so
thick
as
to
spoil
the
good
dame
s
copperplate
the
school
was
hushed
though
as
the
dame
who
taught
it
entered
and
took
her
seat
behind
the
desk
a
quaint
figure
in
her
black
gown
white
apron
great
spectacles
and
back
hair
all
the
children
of
these
old
colony
days
seated
in
front
of
her
on
the
hard
benches
bent
their
heads
low
again
over
their
spellers
or
slates
their
hair
was
smoothly
cropped
or
tightly
braided
only
the
wayward
little
girl
perched
high
upon
the
dunce
s
stool
wore
her
hair
in
a
mass
of
tangled
curls
they
gleamed
like
gold
in
the
sunshine
that
filtered
in
through
the
window
susan
s
hair
was
like
her
own
wilful
little
self
impatient
of
bounds
and
training
as
the
dame
had
returned
to
the
room
susan
s
lips
had
drooped
a
little
and
lost
their
smile
she
cast
her
eyes
toward
the
toes
of
her
buckled
shoes
just
above
which
ruffled
the
dainty
white
frills
of
her
pantalettes
she
crossed
her
hands
demurely
in
the
lap
of
her
gown
presently
though
susan
looked
up
and
glanced
out
of
the
school
window
there
was
the
green
boston
common
and
the
white
and
the
brick
mansions
with
their
wide
white
doorways
and
brass
knockers
susan
could
see
in
fancy
as
far
as
the
sea
front
where
she
knew
there
were
british
ships
at
anchor
with
the
fishing
smacks
and
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
colonies
illustration
the
wayward
little
girl
perched
high
upon
the
dunce
s
stool
these
were
troubled
times
as
susan
well
knew
for
the
settlers
in
the
new
land
she
heard
her
father
speak
of
the
growing
discontent
of
the
colonies
against
the
stern
rule
of
the
english
king
and
their
disinclination
to
pay
taxes
on
goods
when
they
were
allowed
no
representation
in
parliament
only
that
morning
as
susan
had
pouted
and
frowned
when
her
mother
tried
to
comb
out
her
twisting
tangling
curls
there
had
been
the
sound
of
loud
voices
in
the
next
room
where
her
father
received
his
business
callers
susan
s
mother
had
sighed
ah
susan
dear
why
do
you
add
to
our
troubles
by
being
such
a
wilful
little
lass
hear
you
not
the
voices
in
the
other
room
it
is
the
king
s
collector
and
your
father
is
trying
to
explain
to
him
that
the
congress
feels
it
especially
unjust
to
be
obliged
to
pay
a
tax
on
pleasant
beverage
that
is
so
much
drunk
at
the
boston
parties
i
know
not
how
it
will
all
come
out
and
my
heart
is
aching
for
the
trouble
that
i
feel
will
come
be
good
dear
child
this
will
help
us
as
you
can
in
no
other
susan
had
thrown
her
arms
about
her
mother
s
neck
in
a
burst
of
love
i
will
be
good
dear
mother
i
will
be
good
she
had
exclaimed
for
at
heart
there
was
no
kinder
child
in
all
boston
than
little
mistress
susan
boudinot
the
scene
came
back
to
her
now
and
she
turned
toward
her
teacher
the
dame
reaching
out
her
slim
little
arms
imploringly
what
right
had
she
a
little
girl
to
be
naughty
when
her
country
was
in
such
dire
peril
she
thought
i
will
be
good
she
said
in
a
burst
of
penitent
tears
as
the
dame
motioned
kindly
to
her
to
leave
the
dunce
s
corner
i
do
not
know
why
i
was
moved
to
tie
mercy
and
prudence
together
by
their
hair
except
it
was
what
the
elder
speaks
of
in
meeting
as
the
old
adam
coming
out
of
one
and
i
am
sorry
indeed
about
the
that
will
do
the
dame
said
trying
not
to
smile
take
your
seat
susan
and
write
at
least
ten
times
be
ye
kind
to
one
another
in
your
copy
book
and
remember
to
keep
it
treasured
in
your
mind
as
well
as
on
the
white
susan
slipped
gladly
into
her
place
beside
abigail
and
was
soon
scratching
away
with
her
quill
pen
as
industriously
as
any
of
the
others
school
was
not
out
until
late
in
the
afternoon
and
susan
surrounded
by
abigail
and
mercy
and
prudence
and
many
of
the
other
little
colonial
maidens
took
their
merry
way
through
the
narrow
streets
of
old
boston
in
their
flowered
poke
bonnets
round
silk
capes
and
full
skirts
they
looked
like
a
host
of
blossoms
of
as
many
different
green
pink
and
blue
at
the
gate
of
one
of
the
old
mansions
not
far
from
the
common
susan
her
curls
flying
and
her
cheeks
rosy
from
the
warm
sea
air
waved
her
hand
in
i
would
invite
you
all
to
come
in
for
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
in
the
garden
but
my
mother
was
not
feeling
well
when
i
left
her
this
morning
and
i
see
her
beckoning
to
me
from
her
she
darted
through
the
door
and
up
the
wide
staircase
she
found
her
mother
almost
in
tears
there
is
to
be
a
party
at
the
royal
governor
s
house
madam
boudinot
exclaimed
this
very
afternoon
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
represent
your
father
s
family
for
i
feel
far
too
ill
to
put
on
my
best
dress
and
go
many
prominent
people
will
be
there
representing
the
colonists
and
the
king
oh
what
shall
i
do
susan
considered
a
moment
at
the
same
time
capably
fetching
the
lavender
salts
for
her
mother
and
putting
cloths
wet
with
toilet
water
on
her
aching
head
then
she
had
an
idea
for
there
was
much
wisdom
packed
away
in
the
head
of
mistress
susan
do
you
set
your
mind
and
heart
at
rest
dearest
mother
she
said
i
will
do
my
hair
up
standing
in
front
of
an
oval
mirror
susan
caught
a
few
of
her
curls
at
the
back
she
pulled
them
up
to
the
top
of
her
head
and
fastened
them
there
with
a
band
of
velvet
while
the
rest
hung
in
a
golden
shower
over
her
shell
pink
ears
there
susan
exclaimed
i
look
as
old
as
a
miss
of
fourteen
and
i
can
be
quite
as
dignified
i
will
put
on
my
best
silk
dress
and
my
silk
hose
and
my
sunday
shoes
with
the
silver
as
she
spoke
susan
pulled
out
boxes
and
opened
a
chest
and
drawers
then
she
stood
in
front
of
her
mother
her
arms
loaded
with
finery
she
made
a
quaint
little
curtsey
the
family
of
the
president
of
the
continental
congress
will
be
represented
at
the
royal
governor
s
party
she
said
mistress
susan
boudinot
will
take
the
place
of
madam
a
space
of
a
later
a
dignified
little
lady
stepped
out
of
the
door
of
the
boudinot
mansion
and
into
a
waiting
chaise
susan
held
her
head
very
high
was
not
her
hair
done
up
for
the
first
time
and
its
mass
of
ringlets
pinned
with
one
of
her
mother
s
combs
her
buff
brocade
dress
was
made
with
a
lace
underbody
a
polonaise
and
deep
frills
of
lace
edged
the
sleeves
and
fell
as
far
as
the
small
white
hands
a
blue
locket
on
a
strip
of
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
was
hung
about
the
little
girl
s
throat
and
over
it
all
was
thrown
a
ruffled
cape
of
her
mother
s
lined
with
fur
as
the
chaise
rattled
away
toward
the
governor
s
mansion
her
mother
s
parting
words
to
her
repeated
themselves
over
and
over
again
in
susan
s
mind
be
a
good
child
susan
and
do
not
forget
for
a
moment
that
you
are
representing
your
father
and
through
him
the
illustration
colonial
furniture
it
was
a
gay
scene
in
which
little
mistress
susan
soon
found
herself
the
governor
s
parlor
was
very
beautiful
with
its
mahogany
chairs
and
great
bowls
of
roses
a
huge
sideboard
was
loaded
with
cakes
and
sweets
and
the
great
round
table
covered
with
a
lace
cloth
was
set
with
priceless
blue
and
white
china
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
whig
and
tory
lovely
young
ladies
of
the
colonies
in
powdered
hair
and
stiff
silks
and
young
men
their
hair
worn
in
powdered
queues
mingled
gaily
after
paying
her
respects
to
the
wife
of
the
governor
susan
found
a
corner
where
she
could
sit
quietly
and
watch
the
party
she
was
not
unseen
though
many
eyes
had
noted
the
dainty
charm
of
the
little
maid
and
the
sweetness
of
her
tone
as
she
had
said
gracefully
to
her
hostess
my
mother
madame
boudinot
sends
her
respects
to
the
governor
s
wife
and
regrets
that
she
can
not
bring
them
in
person
i
am
the
daughter
of
madame
boudinot
and
my
father
is
the
president
of
the
continental
and
a
polite
little
girl
indeed
the
hostess
had
replied
smiling
as
she
turned
and
presented
the
little
girl
to
her
husband
the
royal
governor
and
representative
of
the
king
many
eyes
both
whig
and
tory
had
been
cast
at
the
corner
where
little
mistress
susan
sat
demurely
the
new
land
has
winsome
daughters
said
an
englishman
and
plucky
ones
retorted
an
american
but
susan
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
goodies
that
were
being
brought
in
now
by
the
servants
great
silver
trays
loaded
with
confections
of
all
kinds
the
blue
plates
were
passed
to
the
guests
soft
glowing
candles
sent
their
glimmering
light
over
the
tall
crystal
goblets
and
bowls
of
fruits
then
susan
saw
a
silver
urn
brought
in
and
set
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
governor
s
wife
who
poured
the
fragrant
tea
into
the
blue
cups
here
is
your
cup
of
tea
little
mistress
susan
she
said
susan
took
the
blue
cup
in
her
hand
but
suddenly
its
very
touch
changed
her
from
the
prim
little
maid
she
had
been
before
to
a
small
creature
of
rebellion
the
amber
steaming
tea
in
the
blue
cup
was
to
susan
one
of
the
marks
of
her
country
s
lack
of
independence
must
the
colonies
pay
a
tax
on
tea
to
the
king
across
the
ocean
and
still
be
allowed
no
representation
in
parliament
how
susan
wondered
could
those
other
girls
of
the
colonies
years
older
than
she
sit
there
so
placidly
sipping
their
tea
and
seeming
to
enjoy
it
so
much
suddenly
she
recalled
her
mother
s
words
do
not
forget
for
a
moment
that
you
are
representing
your
father
and
through
him
the
susan
had
made
up
her
mind
what
she
would
do
her
girlish
spirit
of
rebellion
that
sometimes
led
her
to
play
such
pranks
as
she
had
that
day
in
school
suddenly
turned
to
the
will
power
that
made
the
colonists
win
their
fight
for
freedom
in
the
american
revolution
susan
rose
cup
in
hand
and
took
her
way
across
the
room
the
rustling
of
her
silk
skirts
calling
the
attention
of
the
tea
drinkers
to
her
at
an
open
window
she
stopped
and
deliberately
tipped
her
cup
throwing
the
tea
untasted
on
the
grass
outside
then
she
set
the
empty
cup
down
upon
the
table
at
first
there
was
a
hush
then
the
gentlemen
laughed
to
see
the
little
girl
flushed
now
with
confusion
seated
on
the
edge
of
a
high
chair
and
tapping
upon
the
floor
with
one
slipper
illustration
susan
deliberately
tipped
her
cup
throwing
the
tea
untasted
on
the
grass
the
spirit
of
the
colonies
said
the
royal
governor
smiling
i
foresee
that
we
shall
have
to
tame
but
in
spite
of
his
mocking
words
susan
saw
that
more
than
one
of
the
guests
who
claimed
the
cause
of
the
colonies
their
own
set
down
their
tea
and
drank
no
more
of
it
the
first
laughter
died
away
there
was
a
thoughtful
quiet
during
the
remainder
of
the
party
years
and
years
ago
it
was
but
the
brave
rebellion
of
little
mistress
susan
has
come
down
to
the
children
of
in
story
as
one
of
the
helps
in
the
winning
for
america
of
her
independence
the
deacon
s
grasshopper
on
their
way
to
and
from
school
the
boys
and
girls
of
old
boston
cast
curious
glances
toward
the
shop
of
deacon
shem
drowne
it
was
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
they
were
colonial
children
the
boys
wore
short
coats
and
long
trousers
and
the
little
girls
long
plain
skirts
almost
touching
the
tops
of
their
shoes
when
it
rained
as
it
often
did
in
the
long
chilly
days
of
late
winter
they
wrapped
themselves
in
heavy
capes
and
ran
between
the
drops
for
they
had
no
umbrellas
but
rain
or
no
rain
samuel
and
abigail
and
the
others
could
not
pass
the
deacon
s
tiny
window
through
it
they
knew
they
might
have
a
peep
at
his
strange
craft
even
the
sound
of
his
hammer
thrilled
them
he
was
a
coppersmith
of
old
boston
and
his
shop
of
one
room
was
down
near
the
wharves
where
british
ships
lay
at
anchor
and
the
fishermen
plied
their
trade
all
day
on
sundays
deacon
drowne
went
to
the
white
on
the
common
and
passed
the
contribution
basket
and
rapped
the
head
of
any
child
who
went
to
sleep
during
the
sermon
illustration
he
perched
himself
upon
a
stool
beside
his
work
bench
when
monday
came
though
the
deacon
was
a
very
different
person
he
put
on
a
little
round
cap
and
a
short
leather
apron
he
perched
himself
upon
a
stool
beside
his
work
bench
and
chuckled
like
some
little
wizened
gnome
of
the
mountain
as
he
looked
at
his
sheets
of
copper
and
brass
his
scissors
dies
and
the
many
hammers
large
and
small
that
he
used
for
shaping
metals
the
trade
of
a
coppersmith
was
not
one
to
interest
children
greatly
in
those
days
the
deacon
had
to
patch
some
housewife
s
preserving
kettle
or
make
copper
toes
for
the
shoes
of
a
little
colonial
lad
who
had
worn
out
the
leather
too
soon
to
suit
his
father
s
sense
of
economy
sometimes
he
had
a
clock
to
mend
or
a
teakettle
that
needed
a
new
handle
none
of
these
were
unusual
enough
tasks
so
to
attract
the
boys
and
girls
of
boston
they
were
familiar
with
teakettles
having
to
fill
them
so
often
and
copper
toes
on
their
shoes
hurt
their
feet
it
was
something
quite
different
that
drew
them
to
the
window
and
door
of
the
coppersmith
what
do
you
suppose
deacon
drowne
will
have
hidden
under
his
work
bench
samuel
would
ask
oh
i
do
not
know
i
am
curious
to
see
is
he
not
a
person
of
great
skill
and
many
surprises
abigail
would
reply
it
was
quite
true
the
old
coppersmith
saw
possibilities
in
his
craft
that
would
have
amazed
his
patrons
who
thought
that
the
deacon
s
mind
was
bent
all
day
long
on
patches
and
wires
when
his
day
s
work
was
over
the
old
coppersmith
closed
his
shutter
and
lighted
a
candle
he
lighted
too
a
small
stove
in
which
he
could
heat
his
metals
and
weld
them
into
queer
and
curious
shapes
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sheets
of
copper
and
brass
in
which
he
worked
were
too
beautiful
for
the
commonplace
uses
to
which
he
had
to
put
them
his
mind
went
back
to
the
days
of
his
boyhood
in
england
when
he
lived
on
a
farm
near
the
sea
and
could
watch
the
ships
beyond
the
fields
where
the
sea
lay
blue
and
clear
as
these
thoughts
came
to
him
he
welded
his
metals
to
make
the
figures
that
his
memory
painted
for
him
no
wonder
the
children
were
excited
at
what
the
coppersmith
would
show
them
that
he
had
made
over
night
he
would
beckon
to
them
to
cross
his
threshold
then
with
his
eyes
twinkling
like
stars
through
his
spectacles
he
would
hold
up
in
triumph
something
that
he
had
made
once
it
was
a
little
brass
rooster
shining
and
beautiful
from
his
comb
to
the
last
tail
feather
once
the
deacon
showed
the
children
a
curious
little
admiral
made
of
copper
and
holding
a
telescope
as
he
looked
far
off
at
an
imaginary
sea
then
to
please
them
he
made
a
small
indian
of
copper
the
figure
was
complete
even
to
the
feathers
in
his
headdress
how
the
children
did
laugh
though
when
deacon
drowne
showed
them
a
copper
grasshopper
that
he
had
welded
it
was
so
much
larger
than
a
real
grasshopper
that
it
looked
like
some
strange
dragon
it
quite
filled
the
tiny
shop
its
long
slender
legs
stretching
in
every
direction
why
did
you
make
it
the
children
asked
the
old
coppersmith
chuckled
as
he
replied
to
show
what
can
be
done
with
my
shining
metal
he
said
proudly
it
took
skill
to
bend
those
legs
and
make
the
veins
in
a
grasshopper
s
what
will
you
do
with
it
deacon
drowne
asked
the
children
the
old
man
shook
his
head
perhaps
it
has
no
use
he
said
looking
sadly
at
the
copper
grasshopper
sprawled
out
before
him
that
was
what
the
sober
people
of
boston
thought
too
all
except
peter
faneuil
no
one
could
quite
understand
peter
faneuil
he
had
inherited
quite
a
fortune
but
he
lived
in
a
simple
way
and
was
fonder
of
children
and
the
sea
than
of
wearing
fine
broadcloth
and
having
a
coach
he
joined
the
children
one
day
when
they
went
to
deacon
drowne
s
shop
and
he
saw
the
grasshopper
they
had
thought
that
peter
faneuil
would
laugh
at
it
he
did
not
even
smile
he
looked
at
the
shining
copper
wings
and
the
delicate
workmanship
of
the
slim
legs
then
he
grasped
the
coppersmith
s
hand
it
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
he
said
it
ought
to
be
placed
where
every
one
in
boston
could
see
the
deacon
smiled
with
happiness
as
faneuil
and
the
children
left
him
he
touched
the
grasshopper
s
perfectly
shaped
head
how
could
that
be
he
said
wonderingly
the
years
went
on
and
at
last
no
one
heard
deacon
drowne
s
hammering
for
he
was
too
old
to
work
any
longer
at
his
trade
the
children
grew
up
and
samuel
graduated
from
harvard
college
he
was
called
samuel
adams
now
and
was
quite
an
influential
young
man
in
boston
he
was
one
of
those
called
to
attend
a
meeting
in
boston
at
which
an
important
decision
was
to
be
made
should
or
should
not
boston
accept
a
gift
that
peter
faneuil
wished
to
make
the
city
from
his
boundless
wealth
he
wished
to
build
for
boston
a
public
hall
but
this
was
the
unusual
part
of
his
wish
the
hall
was
to
have
a
market
on
the
ground
floor
where
the
incoming
ships
could
display
their
fruits
and
tea
and
cloth
and
the
housewives
of
boston
might
come
and
buy
on
the
top
of
the
hall
there
was
to
be
a
high
tower
and
on
top
of
the
tower
a
weathervane
that
the
sailors
could
see
at
quite
a
distance
from
shore
where
shall
we
transact
our
important
business
in
this
hall
the
meeting
asked
peter
faneuil
over
the
market
was
his
quick
reply
illustration
faneuil
hall
boston
then
they
argued
the
question
and
wrangled
about
it
a
market
in
a
public
building
did
not
seem
fitting
to
them
even
though
there
was
no
public
market
in
boston
at
that
time
neither
did
a
weathervane
on
top
of
the
tower
seem
suitable
some
were
for
it
and
more
were
against
it
it
did
not
matter
that
the
hall
was
to
be
a
gift
to
boston
they
wished
no
new
ideas
to
break
in
upon
the
old
ones
that
belonged
to
england
and
the
king
samuel
adams
and
his
friends
were
opposed
to
the
idea
but
suddenly
peter
faneuil
sent
a
message
to
samuel
that
made
him
smile
and
change
his
mind
the
meeting
closed
and
the
day
was
carried
for
peter
faneuil
he
was
to
build
his
hall
just
as
he
wished
and
give
it
to
boston
every
one
watched
it
with
great
excitement
it
looks
a
low
humble
enough
building
now
but
it
seemed
quite
huge
to
old
boston
the
people
who
had
been
opposed
to
it
grew
to
like
it
when
they
realized
how
much
they
had
needed
a
market
the
magistrates
and
other
officers
of
the
town
found
that
they
could
hold
their
meetings
quite
as
well
over
the
market
as
downstairs
they
could
come
down
and
help
their
good
wives
carry
home
the
day
s
dinner
when
they
had
finished
with
more
weighty
matters
every
one
liked
the
weathervane
it
could
be
seen
for
a
long
distance
on
land
or
sea
and
its
arrow
never
failed
to
fly
north
south
east
or
west
at
first
all
boston
was
puzzled
by
the
figure
on
the
top
of
the
weathervane
it
was
different
from
any
that
they
had
ever
seen
persons
came
from
a
distance
by
to
see
it
it
shone
and
glittered
in
the
sunlight
who
wrought
it
the
people
of
boston
asked
and
when
they
found
out
the
maker
was
acclaimed
as
almost
a
hero
patient
old
deacon
drowne
he
lived
long
enough
to
look
up
through
his
spectacles
and
see
his
great
copper
grasshopper
perched
on
top
of
the
weathervane
of
faneuil
hall
the
grasshopper
is
there
it
has
been
on
faneuil
hall
since
it
saw
the
boston
tea
party
and
heard
the
shots
of
the
lexington
farmers
it
heard
the
hoof
beats
of
paul
revere
s
horse
and
the
splash
of
the
oars
of
the
british
troops
rowing
into
boston
harbor
it
watched
battle
and
ruin
and
then
saw
the
coming
of
peace
and
plenty
again
thousands
of
storms
have
beaten
against
its
copper
wings
and
legs
but
the
good
workmanship
of
the
old
smith
has
helped
the
grasshopper
to
stand
them
all
it
has
been
replated
and
strengthened
in
places
but
the
main
part
of
the
figure
remains
just
as
deacon
drowne
made
it
an
emblem
of
the
humble
but
preserved
for
almost
two
centuries
in
beautiful
workmanship
patience
arnold
s
sampler
count
your
threads
patience
child
you
will
do
well
to
give
better
heed
to
your
sewing
than
to
the
window
methinks
your
eyes
have
been
following
the
garden
path
over
often
the
last
half
hour
and
your
work
has
suffered
the
while
why
when
i
was
a
lass
in
devon
i
had
stitched
six
samplers
before
i
was
your
age
and
one
of
them
had
the
entire
lord
s
prayer
upon
it
embroidered
in
letters
of
red
so
small
that
your
grandame
had
to
don
her
spectacles
in
order
to
spell
it
out
ah
well
the
girls
of
are
catching
the
spirit
of
the
against
the
old
order
and
small
patience
with
the
new
i
must
be
off
patience
and
across
the
orchard
to
mistress
edwards
with
a
bowl
of
curds
she
has
a
mind
that
they
cure
her
gout
do
you
attend
your
work
while
i
am
gone
the
sampler
is
almost
finished
i
can
read
the
text
at
the
top
in
spite
of
its
crooked
letters
dear
child
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
here
are
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
too
and
now
it
remains
only
for
you
to
embroider
your
name
in
the
measure
your
stitches
with
great
care
for
you
will
likely
begin
it
so
near
the
border
that
you
will
have
small
space
left
for
i
shall
be
back
by
tea
mistress
arnold
stooped
to
touch
with
one
thin
white
hand
stripped
of
all
its
jewels
the
bowed
brown
head
of
the
little
girl
who
sat
by
the
window
sewing
if
you
finish
the
sampler
by
five
o
clock
you
may
go
out
in
the
garden
and
play
mistress
arnold
turned
in
the
doorway
and
pulled
from
the
green
silk
reticule
which
hung
at
her
side
a
long
iron
key
i
will
leave
the
key
to
the
barn
in
your
charge
patience
and
on
no
account
give
it
to
any
one
until
i
return
your
father
tells
me
that
his
store
of
powder
and
shot
is
increasing
daily
and
we
are
likely
to
need
these
before
mistress
arnold
sighed
as
she
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
took
her
tall
straight
figure
in
gray
the
pink
clouds
that
the
apple
blooms
made
and
then
out
of
sight
small
patience
arnold
a
little
lass
who
had
seen
eight
summers
in
the
quaint
town
of
lexington
watched
her
mother
then
she
leaned
back
in
the
stiff
wooden
chair
that
was
so
much
too
high
for
her
drawing
a
weary
little
sigh
it
was
very
dull
indeed
and
stupid
to
stay
in
the
bare
kitchen
all
outdoors
the
first
bees
the
robins
and
the
perfume
of
the
apple
trees
called
her
oh
if
she
might
only
drop
her
sewing
to
the
floor
and
run
out
to
the
garden
darting
in
and
out
among
the
trees
like
a
bluebird
in
her
straight
frock
of
homespun
if
she
might
only
sing
in
her
sweet
clear
voice
above
the
hum
of
bees
and
birds
the
songs
that
her
mother
songs
of
merry
old
england
where
every
one
was
happy
and
everything
was
gay
but
no
she
must
not
go
there
was
the
square
of
rough
cloth
in
her
hand
and
the
sticky
needle
and
the
thread
that
would
knot
in
spite
of
patience
s
care
every
little
girl
in
lexington
had
finished
a
sampler
and
some
of
them
two
by
the
time
they
were
nine
she
must
hurry
for
the
afternoon
was
wearing
away
soon
the
sun
would
drop
behind
the
orchard
such
a
long
name
it
was
to
arnold
patience
took
up
her
needle
again
and
began
to
count
the
stitches
and
embroider
the
letters
there
were
so
many
of
the
letters
and
they
were
very
crooked
for
all
the
world
like
the
new
minutemen
whom
her
father
drilled
on
the
village
green
when
it
was
dusk
no
one
saw
the
minutemen
march
and
countermarch
and
no
one
could
hear
their
feet
in
the
soft
grass
patience
laughed
to
herself
a
merry
little
trill
of
a
laugh
as
she
bent
over
the
letters
of
her
work
you
are
mistress
anderson
s
lad
who
has
such
long
legs
and
thinks
he
will
be
the
captain
of
the
militia
some
patience
pointed
to
the
a
and
she
put
her
needle
in
the
but
a
long
shadow
lay
across
the
doorsill
there
were
other
shadows
on
the
grass
outside
where
had
they
come
from
why
the
orchard
was
full
of
soldiers
one
stood
even
now
in
front
of
most
gallant
gentleman
in
scarlet
broadcloth
and
gold
lace
holding
his
cocked
hat
in
his
hand
and
smiling
down
at
the
little
girl
so
the
bumpkins
of
this
little
town
of
lexington
too
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
gentle
art
of
soldiering
it
is
high
time
that
his
majesty
the
man
seemed
to
speak
to
himself
then
he
bent
so
low
over
the
little
girl
in
her
chair
that
the
gilt
fringe
which
dangled
from
his
epaulets
brushed
patience
s
cheek
such
a
pretty
little
lass
and
so
industrious
as
she
sits
alone
in
this
great
he
paused
watching
patience
s
trembling
little
brown
fingers
she
was
frightened
by
this
emissary
of
the
king
then
he
continued
i
would
ask
shelter
for
my
he
pointed
to
a
score
of
soldiers
in
red
coats
who
swarmed
the
dooryard
now
laughing
brawling
and
trampling
on
mistress
arnold
s
beds
of
savory
herbs
the
day
is
warm
and
we
have
had
a
long
march
from
boston
town
i
would
that
my
men
might
lie
and
rest
a
space
on
the
cool
hay
of
your
barn
my
little
lady
we
have
tried
the
door
but
we
find
it
barred
and
the
key
is
missing
from
the
padlock
will
you
give
me
the
key
little
maid
patience
bent
lower
over
her
work
as
the
last
words
came
from
the
man
s
lips
reaching
in
her
homespun
pocket
for
the
key
which
her
mother
had
given
her
she
clasped
it
in
her
hand
and
held
it
underneath
the
sampler
as
she
stitched
the
letters
once
more
for
a
second
she
did
not
speak
it
seemed
as
if
her
throat
was
burning
her
lips
were
dry
with
fear
then
she
looked
up
smiling
a
wistful
little
smile
no
kind
sir
i
can
not
give
you
the
oho
so
the
little
lady
is
the
man
crossed
to
the
door
and
motioned
to
the
waiting
soldiers
outside
in
a
second
they
had
obeyed
his
summons
swarming
mistress
brewster
s
clean
kitchen
and
covering
the
spotless
floor
with
the
dust
of
the
high
road
search
the
house
commanded
their
leader
yonder
stubborn
girl
is
and
stubborn
she
will
neither
give
up
the
key
nor
tell
me
where
it
is
overturn
the
chests
of
drawers
tear
up
the
carpets
break
down
the
doors
spare
nothing
i
say
but
bring
me
the
key
of
yonder
no
sooner
were
the
words
spoken
than
the
work
of
pillage
began
sounds
of
doors
and
hinges
wrenched
from
their
places
the
tramp
of
rough
boots
on
the
floor
above
her
head
the
rattle
of
chests
told
the
frightened
little
patience
that
the
work
of
searching
the
house
had
begun
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
key
would
burn
its
way
straight
through
her
palm
so
hot
it
was
her
hands
trembled
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
so
that
she
could
scarcely
see
her
needle
but
still
she
stitched
never
leaving
her
chair
nor
lifting
her
white
little
face
the
soldier
who
had
given
the
command
remained
in
the
kitchen
pacing
restlessly
up
and
down
his
arms
folded
and
a
frown
deepening
on
his
forehead
p
was
nearing
the
edge
of
the
sampler
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
stitched
because
of
the
key
that
lay
underneath
the
cloth
the
letters
were
indeed
crooked
and
straggling
and
lacking
the
precision
of
even
those
that
spelled
the
text
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
now
save
the
ticking
of
a
tall
clock
and
the
tread
of
the
soldier
s
feet
suddenly
the
soldier
in
command
stopped
in
front
of
patience
s
chair
and
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
little
bare
brown
arm
he
spoke
and
the
words
were
full
of
anger
enough
of
this
nonsense
give
me
the
key
i
say
i
will
have
it
illustration
give
me
the
key
i
say
patience
slipped
out
of
her
chair
and
down
to
the
floor
holding
her
sampler
covering
the
hidden
key
as
high
as
the
man
s
eyes
he
loosed
his
grasp
upon
her
arm
looking
at
her
in
wonder
such
a
little
lass
in
her
straight
blue
frock
and
not
as
tall
as
his
own
little
girl
in
england
she
had
the
same
soft
eyes
though
and
the
same
low
sweet
voice
i
would
gladly
give
you
what
you
wish
sir
she
began
bravely
but
i
promised
my
mother
i
would
deliver
the
key
to
no
one
until
she
returned
look
she
held
the
sampler
still
higher
i
am
stitching
my
name
is
it
not
a
stupid
task
on
such
a
pretty
day
soft
answer
turneth
away
the
man
read
the
text
at
the
top
of
the
sampler
then
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
farther
than
the
apple
trees
it
is
indeed
neatly
stitched
little
lass
he
said
my
own
elizabeth
is
even
now
making
her
sampler
and
wetting
it
with
tears
until
i
return
to
her
he
gave
a
quick
command
to
his
men
who
filed
down
the
stairs
empty
handed
and
into
the
garden
then
he
raised
his
hat
in
salute
and
followed
them
as
they
marched
slowly
down
the
road
and
farther
than
patience
could
see
my
little
you
safe
it
was
mistress
arnold
who
ran
across
the
orchard
and
into
the
kitchen
clasping
the
trembling
little
lass
in
her
arms
we
saw
the
red
coats
from
mistress
brewster
s
window
and
knew
that
they
had
been
here
but
you
are
the
powder
i
spoiled
my
sampler
mother
patience
gave
a
sobbing
laugh
as
she
held
up
her
work
with
the
crookedly
stitched
ending
and
the
unfinished
name
it
is
as
you
feared
i
started
my
name
too
near
the
border
and
there
is
no
room
to
finish
it
but
held
out
the
precious
bit
of
iron
here
is
the
sampler
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
abcdefghijklmnopq
patience
arnold
the
star
lady
from
tabitha
wells
aged
ten
at
philadelphia
in
the
year
to
her
cousin
john
bradford
at
letter
my
dear
john
it
does
seem
more
than
a
month
ago
that
i
said
to
you
and
you
took
your
long
journey
home
again
your
visit
was
a
bright
spot
in
these
troubled
times
do
you
remember
the
pair
of
robins
that
we
watched
building
their
nest
in
grandmother
s
old
apple
tree
they
have
raised
their
brood
of
young
ones
now
and
the
little
birds
have
flown
away
the
old
birds
still
live
in
the
apple
tree
though
and
each
day
at
sunrise
and
sunset
they
sing
as
if
all
the
world
were
gay
instead
of
fallen
into
this
sad
revolution
and
the
early
apples
are
as
red
as
the
coat
of
a
british
soldier
and
are
dropping
all
over
the
grass
of
the
garden
grandmother
gave
me
a
pewter
canister
that
used
to
hold
knew
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
we
have
any
more
tea
to
put
in
it
i
have
filled
it
full
of
apples
one
layer
of
fruit
and
then
one
of
leaves
to
keep
them
from
bruising
it
is
as
sweet
smelling
as
our
garden
john
where
you
played
with
me
so
many
happy
days
this
spring
it
is
for
you
the
apples
shall
go
to
you
by
the
next
packet
but
here
i
am
writing
you
of
such
everyday
matters
as
robins
and
apples
and
wasting
paper
which
is
rising
in
price
and
using
up
one
of
my
grandfather
s
best
quill
pens
and
his
ink
stone
i
had
other
things
in
mind
to
tell
you
john
when
i
started
this
of
far
greater
importance
strange
happenings
have
come
to
your
cousin
tabitha
wells
in
philadelphia
since
she
said
goodbye
to
you
john
i
feel
as
if
i
a
little
girl
of
only
ten
summers
and
not
as
learned
as
i
should
be
were
of
a
part
with
these
great
and
stirring
times
in
the
colonies
to
wit
as
the
barristers
say
and
now
my
dear
john
i
will
tell
my
story
i
mind
that
we
played
so
much
at
home
when
you
visited
me
john
that
i
had
no
time
to
take
you
to
the
little
upholstery
shop
on
arch
street
near
grandmother
s
house
which
is
my
special
delight
it
is
kept
by
one
mistress
betsy
ross
not
much
more
than
a
girl
they
say
she
is
little
past
twenty
in
years
and
she
has
a
great
pleasure
in
letting
me
visit
and
watch
her
at
work
her
husband
was
a
brave
young
patriot
of
our
colonies
and
was
but
a
brief
space
since
killed
betsy
always
helped
him
in
his
shop
and
now
that
he
will
be
there
no
longer
and
she
being
most
skillful
with
her
needle
she
is
carrying
on
the
work
of
the
shop
herself
when
i
have
finished
wiping
the
dinner
service
for
grandmother
i
often
ask
leave
to
go
down
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
to
the
shop
of
mistress
betsy
i
mind
that
we
are
both
of
us
lonely
i
the
only
child
in
so
quiet
a
house
as
this
in
which
my
father
left
me
when
he
joined
the
army
and
she
a
slim
sweet
lady
all
alone
in
her
shop
such
pretty
stuffs
as
she
has
john
if
you
were
a
girl
your
eyes
would
stick
out
for
envy
and
your
fingers
ache
for
scissors
and
needle
she
gave
me
a
bit
of
yellow
satin
brocade
picked
out
with
a
pattern
of
butterflies
i
made
a
court
dress
of
it
for
my
wooden
grandmother
says
such
finery
is
not
for
a
doll
even
in
these
days
but
here
i
am
letting
my
quill
go
wandering
again
john
it
is
not
of
my
doll
that
i
am
minded
to
write
you
but
of
the
important
thing
that
happened
in
the
shop
of
mistress
betsy
ross
this
summer
time
i
was
there
john
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
mistress
betsy
was
fitting
new
covers
to
grandmother
s
best
chairs
and
i
had
come
down
to
her
shop
to
see
if
they
were
done
it
chanced
that
they
were
but
i
lingered
a
while
for
mistress
betsy
was
busying
herself
at
what
she
likes
best
to
do
she
was
stitching
a
flag
you
know
of
course
john
that
each
of
our
american
colonies
has
its
own
flag
each
of
a
different
design
although
they
all
favor
the
same
colors
red
and
white
and
blue
such
days
as
these
when
troops
are
marching
to
war
there
is
need
of
many
flags
and
so
mistress
betsy
is
as
busy
stitching
them
as
she
is
in
making
her
furniture
covers
so
quick
and
deft
she
is
john
i
wish
you
could
but
see
how
neatly
she
sews
together
the
colors
and
stitches
on
the
designs
no
scrap
of
cloth
is
wasted
and
each
flag
that
mistress
betsy
makes
is
quite
perfect
in
shape
and
pattern
i
mind
that
the
packet
had
just
brought
mistress
betsy
some
bundles
of
fresh
stuff
for
her
red
and
blue
and
she
was
looking
it
over
as
she
spoke
to
me
tabitha
child
mistress
betsy
said
to
me
it
would
save
me
much
time
and
work
if
i
had
one
pattern
for
a
flag
it
tries
my
patience
sorely
to
keep
in
my
thoughts
and
at
my
fingers
ends
the
patterns
of
so
think
the
voice
of
a
man
surprised
us
and
we
looked
up
to
see
a
very
grand
gentleman
standing
in
the
door
of
the
shop
and
looking
at
us
i
heard
your
speech
just
now
mistress
ross
he
said
and
it
is
even
upon
such
an
errand
that
i
come
to
you
the
continental
congress
is
of
a
mind
to
adopt
one
flag
that
will
be
the
flag
of
freedom
and
the
emblem
of
the
brave
one
banner
for
the
colonies
the
fame
of
your
fine
needlework
has
come
to
our
ears
mistress
ross
and
we
are
here
to
consult
with
you
in
the
the
gentleman
very
fine
indeed
in
his
blue
broadcloth
and
gold
lace
stepped
into
the
little
shop
now
and
behind
him
were
other
gentlemen
in
the
uniform
of
the
colonies
i
confess
john
that
i
was
a
bit
awed
and
i
hid
myself
behind
mistress
betsy
s
tall
clock
where
i
could
hear
but
not
be
seen
you
see
i
was
in
my
frock
not
dressed
for
company
mistress
betsy
wore
her
long
working
apron
over
her
chintz
short
gown
but
she
curtsied
with
great
ease
illustration
i
could
hear
but
not
be
seen
you
honor
me
washington
mistress
betsy
said
i
have
been
long
of
a
desire
to
put
my
needle
into
one
flag
and
one
only
what
might
be
your
wishes
and
that
of
the
congress
in
the
pattern
of
this
flag
so
this
was
the
great
washington
my
heart
went
john
as
loudly
it
seemed
to
me
as
sounded
the
ticking
of
the
clock
i
tried
to
hold
it
quiet
as
i
listened
to
washington
s
every
word
we
have
not
made
any
fixed
design
for
an
american
flag
mistress
ross
washington
said
we
feel
that
all
the
thirteen
colonies
should
in
some
way
have
notice
in
it
and
i
have
a
great
desire
that
there
should
be
he
took
a
quill
from
mistress
betsy
s
secretary
and
began
making
drawings
on
a
piece
of
paper
mistress
betsy
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
watched
his
long
fingers
trying
to
see
what
manner
of
a
flag
he
was
designing
see
mistress
ross
washington
said
i
should
like
stars
like
this
he
held
up
his
drawing
mistress
betsy
took
the
drawing
and
looked
at
it
turning
it
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
i
came
out
from
behind
the
clock
and
looked
too
for
i
was
of
a
curious
mind
about
this
new
flag
oh
john
if
you
could
have
seen
the
strange
crooked
star
that
washington
had
drawn
he
is
a
great
soldier
and
statesman
without
doubt
but
he
is
not
a
draughtsman
i
saw
mistress
betsy
s
eyes
twinkle
but
she
was
quite
sober
and
respectful
when
she
spoke
you
have
your
eyes
on
your
men
washington
during
your
night
marches
not
on
the
stars
your
star
is
drawn
with
six
points
and
it
should
have
only
five
points
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
show
you
how
to
make
a
star
then
mistress
betsy
picked
up
a
scrap
of
white
cloth
folded
it
deftly
into
five
parts
made
one
snip
with
her
scissors
and
opened
it
there
was
a
perfect
star
with
five
points
mr
washington
took
it
and
as
he
looked
at
it
his
stern
face
changed
and
he
smiled
then
he
bowed
as
he
turned
to
go
well
done
mistress
ross
he
said
i
have
the
idea
of
an
american
flag
in
my
mind
but
you
have
it
in
your
fingers
put
your
wits
to
the
task
of
designing
a
flag
to
submit
to
the
congress
and
i
hope
that
the
colonies
will
see
fit
to
adopt
it
good
afternoon
mistress
of
flags
and
washington
and
his
gentlemen
had
gone
oh
john
how
excited
we
were
then
mistress
ross
took
my
hands
in
hers
and
she
danced
like
a
girl
with
me
about
the
shop
then
she
sat
down
in
her
big
wooden
rocking
chair
and
took
me
in
her
lap
she
put
her
arms
around
me
and
pulled
my
head
close
to
hers
i
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
as
she
spoke
tabitha
wells
she
said
the
chance
has
come
to
me
to
do
something
for
my
country
my
husband
died
for
the
colonies
but
i
who
must
live
may
perhaps
make
the
flag
that
will
wave
in
remembrance
of
him
and
of
all
the
other
patriots
and
i
knowing
how
she
felt
could
only
hug
her
not
speaking
because
of
a
great
choking
in
my
throat
but
we
soon
realized
that
it
was
not
a
time
for
tears
but
for
doing
mistress
betsy
jumped
up
and
thrust
her
hands
deep
into
her
colored
stuffs
only
three
colors
for
the
flag
of
our
country
tabitha
she
said
red
for
the
blood
of
her
patriots
and
blue
for
her
truth
and
white
for
her
purity
but
now
for
the
design
she
laid
the
pieces
of
cloth
together
and
tried
them
this
way
and
that
oh
how
we
puzzled
our
minds
john
over
that
flag
or
mistress
betsy
did
while
i
looked
on
and
clapped
my
hands
in
pride
for
her
i
forgot
the
time
it
grew
late
and
grandfather
had
to
come
for
me
but
i
went
again
the
next
day
to
mistress
betsy
s
shop
and
for
many
days
to
watch
her
plan
the
pattern
of
our
one
flag
you
see
my
dear
john
it
was
no
easy
task
washington
had
said
that
he
was
of
a
mind
to
have
the
thirteen
colonies
represented
in
it
mistress
betsy
herself
was
always
of
a
mind
to
make
her
needlework
good
to
look
at
because
of
its
simplicity
so
she
cut
and
stitched
and
ripped
and
then
stitched
again
it
was
a
weary
work
and
lasted
through
the
burning
of
many
candles
but
at
last
mistress
betsy
finished
her
flag
oh
john
if
you
could
but
see
it
it
is
plain
which
the
better
shows
its
bright
colors
of
red
and
white
and
blue
it
has
seven
long
red
stripes
and
six
long
white
stripes
making
thirteen
in
all
for
the
thirteen
colonies
as
i
look
at
the
stripes
they
mind
me
of
the
long
way
our
colonies
are
taking
to
their
freedom
then
in
one
corner
of
the
flag
is
a
large
piece
of
blue
cloth
and
sewed
to
it
with
mistress
betsy
s
tiny
stitches
are
thirteen
stars
the
stars
are
for
our
colonies
too
like
stars
they
will
shine
and
now
comes
the
amazing
part
of
this
letter
which
has
tried
you
i
fear
with
all
its
quill
scratching
washington
is
so
greatly
pleased
with
mistress
betsy
s
endeavor
to
carry
out
his
wishes
that
her
flag
is
to
be
adopted
by
the
congress
it
will
be
our
american
flag
forever
and
ever
i
tabitha
wells
know
the
sweet
lady
who
made
it
i
can
scarcely
wait
for
my
father
to
come
home
to
tell
him
about
it
the
flag
of
our
union
john
and
made
here
in
philadelphia
and
in
the
shop
of
my
mistress
betsy
i
am
going
to
call
her
my
star
lady
after
this
illustration
colonial
spinning
wheel
and
clock
your
patience
has
been
tried
dear
john
i
fear
in
reading
this
long
letter
i
have
had
trouble
with
my
quill
which
would
not
travel
over
the
paper
as
fast
as
my
thoughts
come
i
hear
that
you
are
having
stirring
times
in
boston

i
pray
that
you
are

shall
count
the
days
until
your
letter
comes
as
soon
as
i
can
i
will
have
a
small
flag
made
for
you
in
the
star
lady
s
shop

i
can
send

by
the
same
packet
as

apples
so
you
will
remember
philadelphia
well
john
by
the
fruit
of
our
garden
and
by
the
first
american
flag
your
cousin
tabitha
the
flag
of
their
regiment
prudence
looked
up
from
her
sewing
it
was
a
pleasant
place
to
work
out
there
in
the
morning
sunshine
that
trickled
through
the
big
white
pillars
of
the
broad
piazza
the
wide
street
was
overarched
by
the
leafy
branches
of
the
spreading
elms
but
the
houses
that
lined
the
streets
were
strangely
empty
of
life
it
was
in
philadelphia
in
the
long
time
of
the
revolution
prudence
was
a
quaint
demure
little
colonist
girl
in
all
her
eleven
years
she
had
known
nothing
save
the
daily
routine
of
the
simple
home
the
scouring
of
floors
the
polishing
of
copper
kettles
and
brass
andirons
and
mahogany
chairs
the
making
of
huge
loaves
of
bread
and
yellow
butter
and
round
cheeses
the
bleaching
of
linen
and
the
patching
together
of
gay
blocks
of
colored
cloth
to
make
and
bed
quilts
sometimes
there
was
a
quilting
bee
or
donation
party
at
the
minister
s
to
attend
these
with
their
feasts
of
rich
preserves
and
pound
cake
and
the
children
s
table
set
after
the
had
finished
were
wonderful
parties
for
prudence
usually
though
her
days
were
very
much
alike
she
helped
her
mother
and
studied
her
lessons
from
school
books
in
queer
wooden
covers
and
stitched
her
sampler
when
the
studying
was
done
illustration
colonial
silver
it
was
not
a
sampler
though
that
prudence
was
working
on
so
busily
now
her
needle
flew
in
and
out
as
she
stitched
together
with
even
small
stitches
some
long
straight
strips
of
red
calico
and
white
cotton
in
her
lap
lay
some
pieces
of
plain
white
cotton
calico
the
edges
were
neatly
turned
in
and
basted
ready
for
sewing
upon
a
square
of
blue
calico
cloth
that
prudence
had
just
cut
put
up
your
work
it
s
too
pleasant
a
day
to
prudence
looked
up
and
saw
a
boy
standing
in
front
of
neighbor
william
brewster
the
hair
of
each
of
these
little
philadelphia
children
was
cut
short
and
square
they
had
the
same
round
rosy
faces
prudence
s
frock
and
william
s
ruffled
shirt
were
both
cut
from
the
same
cloth
it
was
green
and
white
checked
gingham
from
deacon
wells
store
from
beneath
william
s
long
trousers
and
prudence
s
skirt
showed
the
same
stout
shoes
with
copper
tips
on
the
toes
william
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
piazza
and
pulled
prudence
s
sewing
oh
william
prudence
gasped
be
careful
you
ll
soil
the
white
cotton
i
fear
what
ails
your
hands
i
never
saw
them
so
stained
before
in
all
my
william
dropped
down
on
the
top
step
and
held
up
his
two
brown
hands
in
the
sunlight
laughing
merrily
you
are
indeed
right
prudence
he
said
my
hands
need
a
dose
of
my
mother
s
good
soft
soap
but
boy
s
voice
dropped
to
a
all
this
morning
i
have
been
busy
digging
holes
in
the
why
prudence
s
blue
eyes
were
wide
with
wonder
william
got
up
now
and
looked
all
about
him
to
see
that
no
one
was
listening
then
he
whispered
in
prudence
s
ear
for
burying
the
silver
he
explained
we
packed
it
all
in
a
strong
box
my
grandmother
s
teaspoons
the
silver
cake
basket
with
the
design
of
strawberries
around
the
edge
and
the
sugar
tongs
we
buried
them
all
oh
very
was
it
necessary
william
prudence
s
eyes
were
frightened
as
she
spoke
i
know
that
my
mother
before
she
had
to
take
to
her
bed
with
the
ague
planned
to
hide
our
silver
in
the
well
that
is
dried
out
the
red
coats
coming
through
philadelphia
soon
they
do
say
that
they
are
coming
i
am
very
fearful
william
answered
then
as
prudence
s
pink
cheeks
grew
a
little
pale
at
the
thought
the
boy
pointed
to
her
sewing
what
are
you
stitching
prudence
surely
you
are
not
going
to
dress
yourself
in
these
gaudy
colors
it
would
scarcely
be
right
in
these
hard
prudence
laughed
shaking
out
the
strips
of
scarlet
and
white
that
filled
her
lap
no
indeed
william
dark
colors
and
plain
frocks
must
be
worn
by
us
children
of
the
war
i
am
making
a
flag
our
great
beautiful
stars
and
stripes
of
the
colonies
went
to
our
regiment
with
father
and
your
brother
john
but
i
went
down
to
the
flag
shop
of
betty
ross
not
long
ago
and
i
stood
awhile
on
the
threshold
watching
how
she
and
her
maids
cut
and
sewed
their
red
white
and
blue
cloth
together
i
said
to
myself
why
not
make
your
own
flag
prudence
williams
you
have
ten
fingers
and
a
piece
bag
up
in
the
and
here
it
is
all
done
but
sewing
on
the
little
white
oh
prudence
william
s
eyes
shone
it
is
wonderful
how
did
you
ever
measure
and
sew
it
so
well
i
always
did
say
that
you
are
the
most
clever
girl
with
your
needle
of
any
in
it
carefully
made
prudence
assented
but
that
is
because
i
thought
of
my
regiment
with
every
stitch
and
i
wished
that
i
might
march
in
the
regiment
beside
my
father
waving
my
flag
and
shouting
for
the
independence
of
our
dear
colonies
at
every
step
oh
it
is
hard
william
to
be
a
girl
in
this
time
of
the
revolution
with
nothing
to
do
but
sit
at
illustration
it
is
hard
william
to
be
a
girl
with
nothing
to
do
but
sit
at
home
that
it
is
william
said
but
now
let
s
go
in
the
house
and
delve
in
your
cooky
crock
prudence
perhaps
your
cook
has
filled
it
with
her
good
caraway
cakes
and
the
two
little
neighbors
disappeared
through
the
great
white
door
of
the
old
house
in
the
days
that
followed
prudence
quite
forgot
to
dread
the
coming
to
philadelphia
of
the
british
soldiers
rumors
came
of
how
the
red
coats
had
marched
through
the
towns
and
countryside
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
homesteads
appropriated
the
supplies
that
had
been
left
for
the
women
and
children
and
plundered
the
treasures
of
silver
that
were
almost
all
the
wealth
of
the
colonists
news
of
this
reached
the
ears
of
those
who
remained
behind
alone
in
philadelphia
but
prudence
paid
little
heed
to
the
rumors
her
mother
was
better
but
still
an
invalid
and
confined
to
her
room
there
was
only
one
maid
servant
to
do
the
work
of
the
large
house
and
prudence
found
herself
a
real
little
housekeeper
with
her
hands
very
full
all
day
long
she
tripped
up
and
down
the
wide
oak
staircase
with
instructions
from
her
dear
mother
to
the
maid
in
the
kitchen
and
then
helped
to
carry
them
out
she
had
finished
the
flag
it
was
laid
away
in
a
drawer
it
s
hardly
safe
to
fly
a
flag
from
your
piazza
prudence
sensible
william
had
warned
so
prudence
opened
the
drawer
only
when
she
had
a
little
spare
time
then
she
would
kneel
down
on
the
rag
carpet
in
front
of
the
drawer
and
hold
the
beloved
stars
and
stripes
tenderly
in
her
arms
i
love
every
star
and
every
color
she
would
say
to
herself
oh
may
god
win
the
battle
for
us
and
help
to
give
me
back
my
father
and
william
his
brother
john
the
next
morning
when
prudence
set
the
tray
with
her
mother
s
breakfast
she
laid
it
with
unusual
care
upon
the
linen
cloth
stood
the
thin
china
dishes
white
with
a
pattern
of
raised
bunches
of
grapes
in
purple
and
green
the
silver
spoons
and
forks
were
arranged
neatly
prudence
s
mother
sitting
in
a
big
arm
chair
by
the
window
where
the
sweet
odors
of
the
garden
roses
were
blown
up
to
her
looked
lovingly
at
her
small
daughter
you
are
a
good
little
housewife
my
dear
she
said
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
father
will
find
his
little
girl
almost
a
little
woman
when
he
she
paused
a
moment
lifting
one
of
the
silver
spoons
to
break
the
end
of
her
eggshell
if
he
ever
does
return
she
sighed
oh
i
should
have
hidden
the
silver
weeks
the
sound
of
a
muffled
drum
struck
her
ear
she
looked
at
prudence
in
terror
pull
the
curtains
close
child
and
lock
all
the
doors
the
red
coats
are
like
a
line
of
fire
taking
its
winding
way
in
and
out
between
the
houses
the
regiment
of
british
soldiers
streamed
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
here
it
stopped
as
an
officer
and
his
men
stripped
the
fruit
from
some
peaceful
orchard
or
garden
there
at
an
officer
s
order
a
group
of
soldiers
entered
a
house
and
returned
with
bits
of
old
family
treasure
that
war
gave
them
the
privilege
of
taking
prudence
s
heart
beat
fast
but
she
tried
to
be
brave
she
ran
from
room
to
room
stowing
away
the
silver
candlesticks
and
tableware
closing
blinds
and
locking
doors
the
old
maid
servant
her
apron
held
over
her
head
had
fled
to
the
cellar
in
her
fright
her
mother
bravely
directing
prudence
was
still
unable
to
leave
her
room
suddenly
the
front
door
burst
open
and
in
came
william
i
couldn
t
bear
to
leave
you
alone
prudence
he
said
see
i
brought
my
father
s
old
drum
thinking
we
could
make
a
little
noise
on
it
and
scare
the
red
prudence
looked
into
the
brave
face
of
her
little
neighbor
you
ve
given
me
an
idea
william
she
exclaimed
she
ran
over
to
the
chest
of
drawers
opened
one
drawer
and
pulled
out
the
little
homemade
flag
we
ll
both
scare
the
red
coats
she
said
we
won
t
fasten
the
doors
for
it
wouldn
t
be
of
any
use
the
soldiers
could
very
easily
break
the
bolts
and
i
can
t
find
any
safe
place
to
hide
the
silver
come
we
ll
go
right
out
on
the
piazza
and
meet
the
whole
british
army
if
it
comes
she
clutched
william
s
hand
and
tugged
him
toward
the
door
do
we
dare
william
s
round
merry
face
was
very
sober
of
course
we
dare
come
on
you
drum
and
i
ll
wave
the
stars
and
stripes
prudence
said
the
williams
white
house
set
a
little
back
from
the
street
in
the
midst
of
sweet
old
flower
beds
and
low
hedges
of
box
and
yew
looked
like
a
prize
to
the
ruthless
red
coats
it
was
well
known
in
philadelphia
at
that
time
that
prudence
s
father
had
used
much
of
his
wealth
to
further
the
cause
of
the
colonies
this
made
the
invading
enemy
hate
him
it
was
a
common
rumor
too
that
although
the
williams
chests
of
gold
were
greatly
depleted
there
was
still
much
treasure
of
silver
left
in
the
home
news
of
it
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
of
the
soldiers
there
s
the
house
left
flank
wheel
halt
shouted
the
british
general
in
command
he
turned
in
at
the
williams
gate
and
strode
up
the
path
at
the
steps
he
looked
up
and
stopped
gad
he
said
the
children
of
these
stubborn
colonists
would
defy
us
too
but
a
smile
took
away
the
stern
lines
from
his
mouth
on
the
top
step
of
the
piazza
stood
prudence
and
william
two
brave
little
colonists
william
was
beating
a
loud
on
the
cracked
head
of
an
old
drum
prudence
her
arm
held
high
above
her
head
waved
the
little
flag
that
showed
the
glorious
stars
and
stripes
of
their
regiment
you
mustn
t
come
a
step
farther
sir
she
commanded
no
indeed
echoed
william
we
won
t
let
you
come
so
you
re
holding
the
fort
are
you
the
general
asked
we
have
to
sir
prudence
explained
my
father
is
with
the
army
of
the
colonies
and
my
mother
is
ill
this
is
my
neighbor
william
brewster
he
came
over
to
help
me
guard
the
then
she
turned
pleading
eyes
toward
the
great
man
as
she
held
out
her
flag
it
looks
to
me
as
if
there
were
a
thousand
red
coats
sir
more
or
less
out
there
in
the
road
there
are
only
two
of
us
please
sir
for
the
sake
of
our
flag
march
on
was
it
dust
or
the
mist
of
tears
that
made
the
british
general
wipe
his
eyes
he
reached
out
one
ungloved
hand
and
grasped
prudence
s
little
one
give
my
sympathy
to
your
mother
my
child
he
said
kindly
and
tell
her
that
i
hope
she
will
soon
be
better
little
soldiers
remember
that
never
before
have
i
surrendered
but
now
i
do
in
the
name
of
the
king
march
on
he
ordered
to
his
men
looking
back
he
saw
prudence
and
william
standing
in
the
gate
and
waving
him
until
the
trees
and
the
distance
shut
them
from
his
view
the
boy
who
had
never
seen
an
indian
i
saw
painted
feathers
this
morning
the
boy
said
as
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
rude
log
settle
in
front
of
the
fire
and
stretched
out
his
hands
to
feel
the
blaze
he
seemed
angry
about
something
he
went
on
but
he
and
the
young
braves
were
glad
to
see
me
they
like
us
mother
painted
feathers
remembers
how
you
took
care
of
his
little
daughter
laughing
eyes
when
she
strayed
away
from
the
camp
up
in
the
blue
ridge
and
he
still
wears
the
beads
you
gave
him
around
his
neck
heap
big
chief
painted
feathers
but
i
guess
we
ve
made
him
our
the
woman
in
homespun
who
bent
over
a
savory
stew
brewing
in
a
kettle
that
hung
from
the
crane
smiled
as
she
looked
down
at
the
boy
s
manly
face
he
was
the
counterpart
of
his
father
who
had
gone
over
the
blue
ridge
hunting
and
had
never
in
the
trackless
wilderness
of
the
woods
they
feared
he
wore
the
same
kind
of
rough
suit
of
tanned
skins
hide
boots
and
fur
cap
his
eyes
were
just
as
deep
and
fearless
as
his
father
s
had
been
he
was
his
mother
s
mainstay
now
in
the
little
cabin
set
so
far
from
any
other
habitation
in
the
depth
of
the
wilderness
there
were
indians
near
but
so
far
they
had
been
friendly
to
the
two
settlers
i
tried
to
understand
what
painted
feathers
was
angry
about
the
lad
continued
what
was
it
eli
nothing
that
we
have
done
i
trust
the
boy
s
mother
asked
her
voice
trembling
a
little
as
she
peered
out
through
the
window
at
the
gathering
dusk
and
the
gloomy
forest
that
surrounded
them
oh
no
mother
eli
hastened
to
assure
her
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
painted
feathers
and
the
tribe
are
afraid
of
losing
their
land
they
pointed
toward
the
direction
the
shenandoah
takes
beyond
the
blue
ridge
as
it
flows
into
the
potomac
they
say
that
the
land
in
that
valley
is
being
measured
off
with
strange
instruments
and
by
white
men
who
are
going
to
bring
their
own
tribes
and
build
their
own
camps
there
you
can
t
blame
painted
feathers
mother
for
his
tribe
settled
here
first
i
thought
as
i
came
home
what
a
pity
it
would
be
to
take
the
land
away
from
the
indians
such
lofty
trees
and
the
silver
river
and
the
buds
of
the
wild
flowers
opening
everywhere
i
never
saw
the
mountains
look
so
blue
as
they
did
in
the
sunshine
this
morning
and
painted
feathers
has
lived
here
for
years
and
years
he
said
his
clear
boyish
voice
full
of
sympathy
i
know
too
how
painted
feathers
feels
about
this
valley
eli
s
mother
said
he
knows
every
deer
track
and
every
spring
and
partridge
call
for
miles
around
but
i
think
this
is
all
talk
about
surveyors
being
near
son
no
one
has
marked
out
the
lands
in
all
this
time
and
they
would
scarcely
begin
now
how
much
longer
the
days
are
she
added
turning
toward
the
door
to
open
it
and
let
in
the
wind
of
the
evening
it
was
early
spring
and
the
twilight
was
long
and
mellow
to
her
surprise
she
found
a
boy
standing
outside
his
hand
which
he
had
raised
to
knock
with
went
like
a
flash
to
his
cap
he
pulled
it
off
and
stood
bareheaded
as
he
bowed
like
a
young
cavalier
and
smiled
up
at
her
he
was
about
eli
s
age
she
thought
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
but
a
different
sort
of
lad
from
her
sturdy
son
his
long
pale
face
had
the
lines
of
an
aristocrat
even
his
slender
fingers
showed
his
gentle
heritage
may
i
ask
shelter
of
you
for
the
night
he
begged
courteously
as
he
spoke
eli
s
mother
noticed
that
he
carried
surveying
instruments
and
his
clothing
was
and
worn
i
have
come
all
the
way
up
the
shenandoah
and
over
the
mountains
measuring
and
marking
the
land
and
making
maps
of
its
important
features
he
said
i
have
not
slept
more
than
three
or
four
nights
in
a
bed
but
after
tramping
through
your
wild
forests
all
day
have
lain
down
before
a
fire
on
a
little
straw
or
fodder
or
a
bearskin
like
some
beast
of
the
wood
and
my
cooking
has
been
done
on
sticks
over
the
same
fire
with
chips
of
wood
for
he
smiled
as
he
told
of
the
hardships
i
have
strayed
away
from
my
companions
he
said
and
do
not
know
where
to
spend
the
illustration
my
cooking
has
been
done
on
sticks
over
the
fire
eli
crowding
close
to
his
mother
in
the
doorway
had
been
listening
to
the
tale
of
the
stranger
lad
with
the
greatest
interest
he
pushed
open
the
door
now
come
in
he
said
yes
you
must
come
in
and
share
our
supper
and
stop
with
us
in
the
cabin
as
long
as
you
like
eli
s
mother
added
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
three
were
gathered
around
the
rough
deal
table
before
the
fire
eating
bowlfuls
of
the
steaming
broth
my
name
is
eli
what
is
yours
eli
asked
between
mouthfuls
george
said
the
other
lad
i
live
at
mount
vernon
our
neighbor
lord
fairfax
has
an
estate
that
is
so
large
it
extends
way
over
the
blue
ridge
mountains
ever
since
i
was
a
little
lad
i
have
ridden
and
walked
with
lord
fairfax
and
when
he
decided
to
have
his
estate
surveyed
even
as
far
as
this
distant
boundary
i
gladly
undertook
the
work
i
like
this
wild
life
and
the
adventure
of
making
new
paths
in
the
tell
me
about
some
of
your
adventures
george
eli
begged
leaning
across
the
table
his
eyes
bright
with
excitement
the
narrowest
escape
we
had
george
replied
was
when
we
made
our
straw
beds
on
the
ground
a
few
nights
since
and
were
awakened
by
smelling
something
scorched
the
straw
was
on
fire
and
we
were
almost
burned
have
you
seen
any
indians
eli
asked
not
an
indian
the
young
surveyor
replied
indeed
i
wish
that
i
might
for
i
never
have
seen
an
indian
in
my
life
they
were
long
ago
driven
out
of
virginia
you
know
by
the
colonists
once
though
he
added
and
not
so
many
days
ago
if
i
remember
rightly
we
were
setting
up
our
stakes
about
a
tract
of
land
near
here
and
we
heard
a
sudden
crackling
in
the
bushes
there
was
a
bit
of
bright
color
showing
among
the
branches
as
we
looked
like
the
bright
feathers
of
a
chief
s
headdress
but
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
it
may
have
been
only
a
scarlet
tanager
or
a
woodpecker
he
said
carelessly
the
words
had
scarcely
escaped
his
lips
though
when
a
sudden
light
flashed
against
the
window
of
the
cabin
lighting
like
day
the
scene
outside
as
scarlet
and
yellow
leaves
are
whirled
in
a
moment
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
from
a
forest
so
the
thirty
or
more
indians
who
surrounded
the
cabin
seemed
to
have
flashed
out
of
the
swiftly
and
as
silently
painted
feathers
led
them
decked
in
fresh
war
paint
as
were
all
the
other
braves
and
a
scalp
dangled
menacingly
from
his
belt
to
show
that
he
was
bent
on
warfare
with
fierce
gestures
toward
the
cabin
and
the
three
white
faces
that
peered
in
terror
from
the
window
the
indians
made
their
preparations
one
of
the
younger
braves
drummed
loudly
on
a
deerskin
that
he
had
stretched
over
an
iron
pot
another
rattled
a
huge
dried
gourd
filled
with
shot
and
decorated
with
a
horse
s
tail
the
others
built
a
great
fire
directly
in
front
of
the
cabin
pulled
blazing
brands
from
it
and
danced
in
a
circle
with
wild
yells
and
whoops
eli
whispered
his
frightened
explanation
to
the
other
lad
it
s
painted
feathers
and
his
band
of
braves
and
they
re
dancing
the
death
dance
when
they
finish
they
ll
set
fire
to
our
cabin
i
m
afraid
he
used
to
be
our
friend
but
this
morning
he
seemed
in
a
great
rage
about
his
land
and
hunting
ground
being
taken
away
from
the
tribe
by
eli
s
voice
was
trembling
as
he
finished
it
wasn
t
a
wild
bird
that
you
heard
and
saw
in
the
woods
when
you
were
surveying
george
it
was
painted
feathers
watching
you
and
now
he
has
followed
you
to
our
the
other
lad
s
heart
beat
with
terror
but
his
voice
did
not
falter
as
he
spoke
then
i
am
going
out
to
give
myself
up
to
the
indians
eli
i
won
t
have
your
life
and
that
of
your
mother
endangered
when
you
have
been
so
kind
to
take
me
a
stranger
into
your
house
and
feed
and
shelter
he
made
a
quick
movement
toward
the
door
but
eli
intercepted
him
wait
george
it
would
only
satisfy
their
rage
without
doing
any
good
let
me
think
a
but
as
the
three
waited
and
watched
the
cabin
lighted
by
the
fire
outside
the
seconds
seemed
hours
the
shouting
excited
indians
piled
more
logs
upon
the
fire
and
fed
it
with
pine
knots
until
the
sparks
darted
in
a
crimson
cloud
as
high
as
the
tops
of
the
trees
as
they
danced
they
circled
nearer
and
nearer
the
cabin
their
shrieks
growing
each
moment
more
shrill
and
menacing
it
was
time
to
act
if
the
cabin
and
its
occupants
were
to
be
saved
before
either
his
mother
or
the
boy
surveyor
could
stop
him
eli
stepped
out
in
front
of
the
cabin
alone
and
unprotected
he
stood
there
one
hand
held
out
in
welcome
to
the
terrible
indian
chief
illustration
eli
stepped
out
alone
and
unprotected
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
boy
was
a
surprise
to
the
indians
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
spellbound
by
the
boy
s
bravery
and
interested
as
well
in
something
that
he
drew
from
his
coat
and
held
out
in
supplication
toward
painted
feathers
he
had
grasped
the
object
from
its
place
on
the
shelf
over
the
fireplace
before
he
left
the
cabin
it
was
a
tiny
moccasin
made
of
the
softest
of
deerskin
and
embroidered
with
bright
beads
painted
feathers
drew
nearer
to
look
and
eli
spoke
to
him
laughing
eyes
left
her
moccasin
in
the
wigwam
of
her
paleface
friends
we
kept
the
moccasin
because
we
love
laughing
eyes
we
found
her
when
she
strayed
away
from
the
tribe
and
we
gave
her
back
to
her
father
painted
feathers
the
big
as
the
boy
spoke
painted
feathers
nodded
his
great
head
slowly
and
his
cruel
face
softened
a
little
eli
was
quick
to
see
the
advantage
that
he
had
gained
and
he
acted
upon
it
a
strange
pale
face
has
come
to
the
cabin
he
measures
the
land
in
the
valley
but
he
is
the
friend
of
the
indians
he
will
protect
their
hunting
grounds
and
keep
away
strange
tribes
from
the
west
will
painted
feathers
say
how
to
the
stranger
eli
asked
his
voice
trembling
a
little
at
what
might
be
the
outcome
of
his
bold
request
painted
feathers
held
the
little
moccasin
in
his
hand
now
the
touch
of
it
warming
and
softening
his
stony
heart
then
he
slowly
nodded
his
head
in
assent
stalking
nearer
the
cabin
door
come
george
cried
eli
breathlessly
come
out
and
meet
your
friend
painted
feathers
the
big
in
the
flaring
light
of
the
torches
the
great
indian
solemnly
shook
hands
with
the
boy
surveyor
then
as
the
two
boys
stood
in
the
doorway
the
chief
went
back
to
the
fire
and
gave
a
quick
order
to
the
braves
in
a
second
their
fearful
death
dance
was
changed
to
the
slow
stately
steps
of
a
dance
of
welcome
at
its
end
they
put
out
the
fire
and
filed
silently
back
into
the
forest
snuggled
under
bearskins
in
front
of
the
warm
hearth
the
two
boys
slept
but
little
that
night
and
talked
a
great
deal
about
their
wonderful
adventure
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
go
in
the
morning
george
eli
assured
the
boy
surveyor
painted
feathers
tribe
is
the
only
band
of
indians
anywhere
around
here
and
now
that
he
knows
you
are
his
friend
he
won
t
harm
i
shall
never
forget
you
eli
said
george
you
have
taught
me
how
to
be
his
companions
found
the
lad
in
the
morning
and
with
many
thanks
and
assurances
of
his
friendship
the
young
surveyor
left
the
settler
s
cabin
and
started
to
finish
his
work
and
his
trip
more
than
a
score
of
years
passed
where
the
trees
had
grown
there
was
a
town
now
and
the
cabin
itself
was
replaced
by
a
comfortable
frame
dwelling
eli
s
mother
was
an
old
lady
and
he
a
man
grown
it
was
a
time
of
much
stress
for
america
the
period
of
the
revolution
great
news
mother
eli
exclaimed
as
he
came
in
one
day

say
that

washington
has
taken
lord
cornwallis
and
all
his
army
as
prisoners
yorktown
has
surrendered
and
the
war
is
general
george
washington
repeated
his
mother
her
mind
going
back
through
the
years
then
a
thought
came
to
her
eli
she
said
do
you
remember
the
lad
surveyor
who
stayed
with
us
for
a
night
when
you
were
a
boy
he
told
me
his
full
name
as
he
was
leaving
and
all
these
years
i
have
never
thought
to
speak
of
it
to
you
george
washington
he
said
he
the
man
s
eyes
flashed
one
and
the
same
he
said
the
great
general
and
our
guest
george
who
had
never
seen
an
dick
the
youngest
soldier
did
you
hear
the
news
dick
the
children
on
their
way
to
school
along
the
street
of
hartford
caught
up
with
the
lad
of
ten
and
spoke
to
him
they
do
say
that
general
burgoyne
and
all
his
red
coats
are
marching
down
from
canada
and
will
fight
their
way
to
albany
our
soldiers
are
dropping
out
of
the
ranks
from
weariness
with
this
long
struggle
and
general
schuyler
is
calling
for
more
my
father
is
going
to
enlist
in
the
continental
so
is
my
and
my
father
the
lads
and
lassies
in
their
homespun
and
calico
drew
themselves
up
proudly
they
loved
this
fair
green
land
of
america
with
its
fields
of
yellow
corn
and
orchards
of
ruddy
fruit
they
loved
its
blazing
fireplaces
the
games
on
the
common
and
the
brave
ragged
army
of
farmer
soldiers
who
were
trying
to
free
the
colonies
do
you
know
what
general
washington
says
about
us
abigail
a
quaint
little
girl
in
a
long
frock
and
pinafore
said
touching
dick
s
sleeve
he
says
if
all
the
states
had
done
their
duty
as
well
as
our
little
state
of
connecticut
the
war
would
have
been
ended
long
ago
but
of
course
that
doesn
t
mean
us
dick
she
added
there
s
nothing
we
children
can
do
for
the
dick
drew
himself
up
proudly
although
he
was
but
ten
years
old
he
was
as
straight
and
held
his
head
as
high
as
a
soldier
he
looked
down
the
street
toward
a
big
white
house
with
the
stars
and
stripes
flying
from
the
pole
on
the
green
lawn
it
was
the
recruiting
station
where
volunteers
were
enrolled
to
march
against
the
red
coats
i
should
like
to
help
general
washington
he
said
perhaps
they
would
let
me
a
shout
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
children
a
boy
of
ten
a
soldier
in
the
continental
army
what
would
you
do
for
your
country
all
you
know
dick
is
how
to
play
tunes
on
your
grandfather
s
the
words
hurt
the
little
lad
and
his
face
flushed
he
was
about
to
retort
but
the
boys
and
girls
scattered
some
running
ahead
swinging
their
school
bags
some
stopping
to
look
at
the
sweets
in
dame
brewster
s
window
dick
waited
until
he
saw
that
he
was
alone
then
he
hurried
on
down
the
street
and
he
did
not
stop
until
he
had
reached
the
recruiting
station
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
the
sun
touched
their
ranks
with
gold
and
the
summer
wind
carried
the
stars
and
stripes
before
them
the
day
in
when
the
new
volunteer
regiment
left
hartford
it
was
on
its
long
weary
way
over
rough
roads
to
peekskill
on
the
hudson
the
headquarters
of
general
putnam
all
hartford
was
gathered
on
the
wide
piazzas
and
green
streets
to
cheer
the
regiment
on
its
way
all
the
children
were
there
too
waving
their
caps
and
bonnets
all
no
one
child
was
missing
as
the
lines
of
blue
swung
along
beneath
the
great
old
trees
the
sound
of
a
fife
playing
an
old
marching
tune
came
piping
above
the
shouting
and
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
suddenly
every
one
was
quiet
as
the
drummer
came
into
sight
and
beside
him
a
little
lad
of
ten
years
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
the
colonies
and
playing
a
fife
richard
jones
the
children
whispered
in
excitement
to
each
other
it
is
our
dick
going
to
war
with
the
an
old
man
leaning
on
his
cane
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
took
off
his
hat
and
called
to
dick
little
lad
if
you
play
your
fife
as
well
as
grandfather
taught
you
it
will
put
heart
into
the
soldiers
and
strength
in
their
arms
it
was
your
fine
piping
that
won
you
a
place
in
the
regiment
the
youngest
soldier
of
the
revolution
god
save
you
and
bring
you
back
safe
to
hearing
him
dick
stopped
playing
a
moment
and
called
out
grandfather
i
ll
try
to
do
my
duty
then
he
was
lost
to
sight
little
figure
in
a
blue
coat
and
knee
breeches
richard
lord
jones
enlisted
at
ten
years
in
the
army
of
the
american
colonies
dick
could
play
the
fife
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
regiment
it
made
the
soldiers
forget
hunger
and
weariness
and
sleeplessness
to
have
the
little
lad
march
at
their
head
his
gay
tunes
marking
the
time
for
their
ragged
shoes
he
fifed
the
regiment
all
the
long
way
to
white
plains
and
then
up
the
hudson
to
peekskill
where
general
putnam
was
stationed
and
needed
reinforcements
there
he
rested
for
a
while
but
not
long
the
british
commander
general
clinton
appeared
and
captured
two
forts
on
the
west
side
of
the
hudson
general
putnam
was
obliged
to
retreat
up
the
river
it
was
a
wild
retreat
all
the
way
dick
had
little
but
hard
biscuit
and
raw
salt
pork
to
eat
he
marched
through
villages
that
were
in
flames
from
the
fire
brands
of
the
british
he
saw
and
was
able
to
give
information
about
a
british
spy
who
was
condemned
and
shot
then
the
division
to
which
dick
belonged
reached
long
island
where
it
was
commissioned
to
land
at
huntington
the
soldiers
were
in
a
common
transport
though
without
guns
and
it
was
captured
by
a
british
man
of
war
dick
the
little
fifer
was
marched
with
his
colonel
and
officers
and
the
militia
all
picked
men
into
the
presence
of
a
british
commander
the
little
lad
must
have
looked
very
strange
to
the
englishman
his
shoes
were
so
worn
that
his
feet
were
on
the
ground
and
one
could
scarcely
see
the
blue
of
his
continental
uniform
because
of
its
dust
and
rags
he
was
pale
from
going
without
food
and
sleep
but
he
held
his
head
very
proudly
and
high
not
one
of
the
prisoners
was
as
brave
as
dick
as
he
marched
into
the
presence
of
the
enemy
beside
his
colonel
carrying
his
fife
under
his
arm
who
is
this
boy
the
british
officer
demanded
frowning
down
on
the
lad
his
tent
was
bristling
with
swords
and
crowded
with
other
officers
of
the
king
in
scarlet
broadcloth
and
gold
lace
it
was
indeed
a
fearful
place
for
a
little
boy
to
be
but
dick
answered
bravely
a
soldier
of
the
colonies
the
british
officer
laughed
what
can
a
little
bantam
cock
like
you
do
for
the
cause
of
these
fighting
farmers
he
asked
i
ll
wager
you
re
of
no
use
and
methinks
only
a
hindrance
to
your
dick
drew
himself
up
proudly
i
have
played
the
fife
for
the
regiment
these
many
months
he
asserted
stoutly
and
they
do
say
there
isn
t
a
man
in
the
army
can
put
as
much
heart
into
a
tune
as
i
it
might
chance
i
could
fight
too
if
i
were
put
to
a
chorus
of
laughter
from
the
british
officers
greeted
dick
s
last
assertion
you
fight
the
little
cock
thinks
he
could
fight
they
sneered
but
the
british
commander
looked
sternly
at
dick
as
he
spoke
to
him
there
is
too
much
of
this
idle
boasting
in
the
farmer
army
i
would
put
an
end
to
he
motioned
to
an
english
lad
the
boatswain
s
boy
older
and
more
toughly
built
than
dick
fight
the
officer
commanded
let
the
yankee
fight
one
of
king
george
s
men
the
two
lads
went
at
each
other
rough
and
tumble
it
was
hardly
a
fair
fight
the
english
lad
hit
right
and
left
with
iron
fists
and
dick
tried
to
parry
the
blows
weak
from
his
long
marches
and
fasting
dick
s
spirit
and
his
courage
were
stronger
than
those
of
the
other
lad
though
first
one
would
be
on
top
and
then
the
other
while
the
british
officers
and
dick
s
own
men
shouted
down
with
the
enemy
of
the
king
or
down
with
king
george
it
was
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
memorable
fights
of
the
whole
war
for
independence
because
both
lads
felt
that
more
than
their
personal
prowess
was
at
stake
dick
fell
under
his
assailant
s
blows
many
times
but
each
time
he
struggled
to
his
feet
caught
his
breath
and
struck
back
again
enough
the
english
lad
cried
at
last
and
this
battle
like
so
many
others
was
a
victory
for
the
colonies
there
was
scant
mercy
showed
by
the
british
in
those
days
but
one
could
not
help
but
admire
the
pluck
of
the
youngest
soldier
of
the
regiment
the
officer
whose
prisoner
he
was
called
dick
to
him
and
patted
him
on
his
curly
head
a
brave
little
cock
indeed
he
said
as
a
reward
for
your
good
fighting
how
would
you
like
to
have
me
give
you
your
freedom
he
asked
oh
sir
dick
cried
his
whole
face
lighted
with
pleasure
i
should
like
it
very
much
he
stepped
nearer
his
own
commander
i
do
not
want
to
be
released
unless
my
colonel
may
come
with
the
british
officer
considered
a
moment
then
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
kindness
he
granted
dick
s
request
colonel
webb
may
go
too
on
parole
he
said
dick
went
home
for
a
week
in
hartford
after
his
first
fight
there
had
never
been
such
a
hero
as
he
among
the
other
boys
and
girls
he
could
not
stir
outside
of
his
gate
without
a
crowd
of
them
following
at
his
heels
begging
for
tales
of
his
adventures
a
button
or
a
scrap
of
lining
from
his
coat
the
little
soldier
did
not
care
for
fame
though
he
longed
to
be
back
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
so
he
put
his
fife
to
his
lips
again
and
rejoined
his
regiment
they
were
glad
to
see
him
they
had
missed
his
cheerful
tunes
dick
was
with
the
regiment
when
the
great
kosciusko
helped
them
to
fortify
west
point
he
marched
over
rough
and
frozen
ground
two
hundred
miles
to
morristown
but
at
the
end
of
the
weary
way
general
washington
greeted
him
the
winter
of
privation
and
exposure
that
followed
was
not
so
hard
for
dick
to
bear
because
he
was
sharing
it
with
the
great
washington
no
other
boy
had
so
great
an
honor
through
the
three
years
of
his
enlistment
dick
faced
whatever
hardships
came
to
him
without
a
whimper
and
the
sound
of
his
cheerful
fife
tunes
comes
down
to
us
through
all
these
years
as
one
of
the
helps
to
america
s
freedom
he
was
honorably
discharged
from
the
continental
army
when
he
was
a
little
more
than
thirteen
years
old
and
with
an
escort
of
two
soldiers
he
walked
two
hundred
miles
home
no
one
asked
him
now
what
he
could
do
for
his
country
dick
was
the
hero
of
the
children
and
everyone
else
in
hartford
when
the
revolution
was
over
and
the
stars
and
stripes
waved
over
the
free
colonies
dick
knew
that
he
had
helped
in
winning
his
country
s
independence
betsy
s
guest
betsy
looked
with
delight
at
the
dainty
white
frock
spread
out
on
the
big
bed
in
the
spare
room
it
was
early
spring
in
the
quaint
old
southern
town
of
salisbury
through
the
windows
of
the
big
white
house
of
the
brandon
plantation
which
was
betsy
s
home
came
the
sweet
notes
of
the
first
mocking
bird
the
singing
of
the
farm
hands
as
they
ploughed
the
land
for
the
first
planting
and
the
fresh
odor
of
the
pine
trees
a
few
years
before
salisbury
had
seen
the
devastating
ruin
of
war
in
its
lovely
green
borders
now
in
the
year
of
our
lord
and
of
america
s
independence
the
south
was
peacefully
planting
and
harvesting
once
more
barns
and
cellars
and
the
home
larders
were
full
to
overflowing
the
next
day
was
to
bring
a
great
event
to
salisbury
the
president
of
the
new
united
states
george
washington
and
his
cabinet
were
making
a
tour
of
the
south
they
had
driven
in
lordly
leisurely
fashion
in
their
coaches
through
virginia
south
carolina
and
georgia
all
salisbury
would
see
the
greatest
american
in
the
morning
illustration
two
of
the
farm
hands
the
little
town
was
ready
for
the
president
he
was
to
be
met
at
the
village
green
by
an
escort
of
soldiers
who
would
accompany
him
as
he
toured
the
town
and
flower
girls
were
to
head
the
procession
betsy
brandon
was
to
be
one
of
the
flower
girls
and
that
was
why
she
had
such
a
pretty
new
frock
it
was
made
of
the
sheerest
white
dotted
swiss
with
as
many
ruffles
as
a
white
rose
has
petals
and
some
of
the
ruffles
were
caught
up
with
bunches
of
tiny
pink
flowers
and
green
leaves
that
betsy
s
mother
had
made
with
her
own
clever
fingers
a
wide
pink
sash
lay
on
the
bed
too
and
a
white
hat
with
wide
pink
streamers
and
a
bunch
of
the
same
pretty
pink
flowers
in
front
betsy
was
to
wear
pink
silk
stockings
and
white
slippers
never
in
all
her
life
had
she
been
allowed
to
wear
such
lovely
things
she
touched
the
flowing
ruffles
and
the
soft
silk
of
the
sash
thinking
how
happy
she
would
be
with
the
other
little
daughters
of
salisbury
in
the
morning
she
had
not
noticed
that
her
mother
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
spare
room
and
stood
beside
her
looking
down
earnestly
into
the
little
girl
s
happy
face
mistress
brandon
put
her
hand
on
betsy
s
brown
braids
that
were
coiled
neatly
and
tied
about
her
head
my
precious
little
daughter
mistress
brandon
said
there
is
something
that
i
must
tell
yes
mother
betsy
looked
smilingly
into
her
mother
s
sober
face
her
mother
spoke
quickly
now
and
as
if
the
words
hurt
her
your
dear
aunt
tabitha
s
serving
man
has
just
come
in
great
haste
on
horseback
from
her
plantation
to
say
that
his
mistress
is
far
from
well
and
wishes
me
to
come
to
her
at
once
with
a
supply
of
simples
i
must
go
the
maids
are
packing
my
basket
and
laying
out
my
traveling
cloak
and
the
horses
are
harnessed
and
at
the
she
paused
in
sorrow
at
the
grief
that
she
saw
suddenly
in
betsy
s
radiant
face
your
father
will
not
return
for
some
days
yet
she
added
and
then
stopped
there
was
a
pause
and
then
betsy
looked
up
bravely
saying
just
what
her
mother
had
hoped
and
expected
that
she
would
for
she
was
a
good
little
girl
and
grandmother
should
not
be
left
alone
here
because
she
is
not
well
and
the
maids
are
new
betsy
said
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
bear
her
disappointment
she
threw
herself
into
her
mother
s
arms
burying
her
head
in
her
shoulder
i
can
t
be
a
flower
girl
she
sobbed
i
must
stay
at
home
and
not
see
president
washington
oh
i
can
t
bear
it
it
seems
as
if
i
just
can
t
her
mother
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
any
other
little
daughter
except
my
own
brave
little
betsy
perhaps
could
not
bear
the
disappointment
she
said
but
she
can
the
brandons
come
of
a
brave
old
family
strong
to
fight
and
well
able
to
bear
whatever
comes
to
them
and
think
too
dear
what
sorrows
came
to
our
brave
president
before
he
won
the
war
for
us
you
can
try
to
be
as
brave
as
he
dear
child
can
you
not
yes
betsy
was
smiling
again
she
folded
the
dainty
frock
and
the
sash
and
laid
them
away
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
the
big
mahogany
bureau
and
then
she
went
downstairs
and
did
not
shed
one
tear
as
she
kissed
her
mother
and
watched
her
drive
away
between
the
magnolia
trees
that
lined
the
long
driveway
of
the
plantation
it
was
a
hard
afternoon
though
for
betsy
the
little
girl
who
lived
on
the
next
plantation
came
over
to
see
betsy
s
dress
and
after
she
had
shown
it
to
her
betsy
had
to
tell
her
that
she
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
wear
it
she
thought
too
that
it
would
make
her
grandmother
feel
badly
if
she
were
to
know
of
her
disappointment
so
she
sat
with
her
in
her
big
sunny
room
in
the
afternoon
and
read
to
her
and
was
a
smiling
little
girl
all
the
time
late
in
the
day
betsy
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
made
corn
bread
she
was
almost
as
good
a
cook
as
was
her
mother
the
corn
bread
was
as
yellow
as
gold
and
as
light
as
sponge
cake
the
morning
of
the
great
day
for
salisbury
was
as
blue
and
gold
as
sky
and
sun
could
make
it
betsy
was
up
with
the
birds
and
gave
the
maids
their
orders
for
the
day
and
looked
over
the
supplies
in
the
safe
as
the
big
locked
cupboard
for
food
was
called
just
as
mistress
brandon
would
have
done
if
she
had
been
home
she
opened
all
the
windows
of
the
mansion
to
let
in
the
sweet
spring
air
she
filled
the
bowls
and
vases
with
fresh
flowers
and
then
she
sat
down
with
her
sewing
on
the
piazza
betsy
was
working
a
sampler
in
around
the
edge
embroidered
in
bright
crewels
was
a
border
of
flowers
and
bees
the
latter
because
of
her
initials
inside
betsy
was
working
her
name
in
neat
letters
the
lord
s
prayer
and
the
date
of
her
birth
usually
betsy
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
able
to
sit
there
in
the
quiet
of
the
piazza
shaded
by
its
great
pillars
the
green
lawn
stretching
below
the
steps
and
her
colored
sewing
in
her
lap
though
her
eyes
left
the
bright
worsted
often
to
follow
the
line
of
the
plantation
driveway
that
led
away
from
the
house
and
down
toward
the
village
through
the
trees
she
had
glimpses
of
fluttering
white
skirts
and
bright
ribbons
the
flower
girls
her
little
girl
neighbors
were
gathering
and
taking
their
happy
way
down
to
the
village
green
to
meet
washington
she
could
hear
their
merry
voices
and
the
sounds
of
fifes
and
drums
the
soldiers
were
starting
too
betsy
could
see
in
imagination
how
pretty
and
gay
the
town
would
be
people
in
their
carriages
and
coaches
would
be
there
from
miles
around
every
one
would
be
joyous
and
so
proud
to
do
honor
to
the
greatest
american
it
was
hours
too
early
for
him
to
be
there
yet
but
here
they
were
gathering
to
greet
him
i
am
brave
but
it
seems
as
if
i
must
cry
just
a
little
bit
betsy
buried
her
head
in
her
sewing
but
before
she
had
shed
a
tear
a
man
s
voice
startled
her
she
looked
up
he
was
very
tall
and
straight
and
wore
the
beautiful
rich
costume
of
the
colonies
his
velvet
knee
breeches
shoes
coat
and
white
wig
showed
betsy
that
he
was
a
personage
of
importance
but
he
stood
before
her
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
bowed
to
her
quite
as
if
she
had
been
a
young
lady
good
morning
little
lass
of
salisbury
he
said
in
his
deep
kind
voice
pointing
to
her
sewing
you
are
an
industrious
child
such
an
one
as
i
like
to
see
growing
up
in
this
new
land
you
work
betimes
in
the
day
and
with
the
betsy
rose
and
dropped
a
deep
curtsey
to
the
stranger
she
must
have
looked
very
winsome
to
him
in
her
pink
calico
dress
white
apron
and
with
her
cheeks
flushed
to
a
rose
color
in
excitement
my
mother
has
taught
me
that
work
comes
before
play
and
always
in
the
morning
betsy
explained
what
is
your
pleasure
sir
she
went
on
i
am
the
mistress
of
the
brandon
plantation
for
the
day
my
mother
is
called
away
by
the
illness
of
my
aunt
tabitha
and
i
am
taking
care
of
grandmother
and
the
maids
in
her
absence
it
is
a
sore
disappointment
to
me
sir
i
was
to
have
been
a
flower
girl
in
the
village
and
walked
with
our
guest
of
honor
of
the
day
the
stranger
came
up
the
steps
and
took
a
chair
beside
betsy
you
wanted
very
much
to
see
him
he
asked
why
because
president
washington
is
a
great
soldier
and
the
most
important
man
in
the
united
states
betsy
answered
her
hands
clasped
and
her
eyes
shining
with
excitement
the
man
smiled
i
know
him
he
said
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
little
lass
of
salisbury
that
perhaps
washington
is
a
great
deal
like
other
americans
he
loves
the
earth
he
pointed
to
the
wide
expanse
of
the
fertile
brandon
acres
perhaps
too
he
likes
to
try
new
roads
as
i
have
done
this
morning
i
have
come
a
long
distance
he
said
and
am
tired
and
hungry
i
left
my
carriage
at
the
entrance
to
your
plantation
and
the
driveway
looked
so
pleasant
and
quiet
that
i
walked
along
it
until
i
came
to
your
house
may
i
ask
you
for
food
and
drink
little
mistress
of
the
mansion
indeed
yes
sir
betsy
sprang
toward
the
door
but
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
she
turned
do
you
like
corn
bread
sir
she
asked
i
made
some
myself
yesterday
afternoon
it
is
delicious
with
our
fresh
milk
half
that
would
make
a
breakfast
that
i
should
like
above
all
else
the
stranger
said
smiling
and
he
watched
the
graceful
little
figure
as
betsy
slipped
through
the
door
a
good
daughter
of
america
he
said
to
himself
a
housewife
above
all
illustration
little
mistress
of
the
mansion
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
betsy
returned
carrying
a
tray
on
a
white
cloth
there
was
set
gold
and
white
china
thin
and
sparkling
the
