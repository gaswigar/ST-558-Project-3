chapter
i
afternoon
tea
patty
was
curled
up
in
her
favourite
big
in
her
own
study
though
called
a
study
because
it
had
been
used
as
such
during
her
schooldays
the
pretty
room
was
really
more
like
a
her
desk
was
still
there
but
was
now
filled
with
programmes
friendly
letters
and
social
correspondence
instead
of
school
themes
or
problems
the
general
colouring
of
the
room
was
green
but
the
sash
curtains
of
thin
yellow
silk
and
the
heap
of
yellow
sofa
cushions
did
much
to
lighten
the
effect
and
gave
the
room
a
sunshiny
air
even
on
a
dull
day
the
couch
and
the
two
big
soft
cuddly
chairs
were
upholstered
in
chintz
and
on
the
pale
green
walls
hung
patty
s
favourite
pictures
and
many
curios
or
souvenirs
of
her
year
spent
abroad
it
was
the
first
of
march
so
the
room
was
brightened
both
by
a
big
bowlful
of
yellow
daffodils
and
a
blazing
wood
fire
the
two
things
patty
liked
best
in
life
were
warmth
and
colour
and
so
she
was
sitting
near
the
fire
with
the
splendid
yellow
glory
of
the
daffodils
in
full
view
but
she
was
not
looking
at
them
for
she
was
poring
over
a
book
when
patty
read
she
usually
pored
for
she
was
eager
and
enthusiastic
over
any
story
in
which
she
was
interested
but
she
was
not
reading
a
story
she
pored
intently
and
then
throwing
back
her
head
she
would
stare
blankly
at
the
ceiling
thinking
hard
then
perhaps
she
would
fly
to
her
bookcase
tumble
out
two
or
three
books
swiftly
turn
their
pages
and
then
back
to
her
big
chair
and
the
original
book
it
was
a
very
small
book
with
a
paper
cover
but
it
seemed
to
be
most
engrossing
two
or
three
hours
passed
and
still
patty
pored
over
the
little
book
rarely
turning
a
page
she
rubbed
her
head
until
the
hairpins
fell
out
and
her
golden
hair
fell
around
her
shoulders
as
bright
a
glory
as
the
daffodils
vacantly
she
stared
into
the
fire
or
out
of
the
window
and
at
last
she
flung
her
little
book
across
the
room
and
exclaimed
aloud
it
s
no
use
i
can
t
do
it
and
then
nan
her
pretty
stepmother
appeared
at
the
open
door
patty
she
cried
in
a
kimono
and
it
s
nearly
four
o
clock
don
t
you
know
it
s
my
day
nan
said
patty
with
an
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
what
is
it
of
which
the
poor
have
two
and
the
rich
have
none
gracious
patty
what
a
question
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
are
you
going
in
for
more
philanthropy
because
if
so
do
wait
for
a
more
convenient
no
it
isn
t
philanthropy
it
say
nan
how
could
a
headless
man
write
a
letter
he
couldn
and
does
a
bookworm
eat
straight
through
a
book
or
zigzag
i
don
t
know
i
ve
heard
the
bookworm
is
only
a
fabled
animal
like
a
griffin
or
no
i
think
it
s
an
extinct
species
like
the
oh
nan
you
are
so
deliciously
no
more
so
than
you
or
why
do
you
ask
me
these
things
now
patty
stop
this
nonsense
and
get
dressed
what
you
doing
anyway
oh
nan
the
loveliest
scheme
ever
let
me
tell
you
about
no
not
now
i
must
go
down
to
the
and
you
must
follow
just
as
soon
as
you
can
do
you
hear
yes
i
hear
you
old
loveliness
but
just
tell
me
when
but
nan
had
run
away
from
the
fire
of
questions
and
patty
drew
herself
up
out
of
her
chair
stretched
and
yawned
like
a
sleepy
kitten
and
then
proceeded
to
make
her
toilette
with
expedition
and
despatch
but
as
she
sat
in
front
of
her
dressing
table
piling
her
gold
hair
into
a
soft
crown
above
her
pretty
face
she
frowned
at
her
own
reflection
you
re
a
stupid
idiot
she
informed
herself
you
don
t
know
anything
and
you
haven
t
an
ounce
of
brains
now
is
it
of
which
the
poor
have
two
the
rich
have
none
schoolboys
have
several
and
you
have
one
well
i
can
t
think
of
a
thing
but
mumps
or
measles
and
of
course
they
re
not
the
answer
and
you
couldn
t
have
one
measle
as
she
dressed
patty
took
hasty
glances
in
the
little
book
and
finally
she
left
her
room
and
walked
slowly
downstairs
murmuring
divide
nine
into
two
equal
parts
which
added
together
make
but
when
she
reached
the
door
all
the
puzzling
problems
flew
out
of
her
mind
and
she
went
in
gracefully
to
greet
nan
s
guests
as
patty
was
not
yet
out
in
society
she
did
not
have
her
name
on
the
card
with
her
stepmother
s
but
she
always
assisted
nan
in
receiving
and
informally
asked
a
number
of
her
own
friends
to
call
too
this
was
nan
s
last
reception
day
for
the
season
so
it
was
a
little
more
elaborate
than
others
had
been
patty
wore
an
embroidered
white
which
delicate
material
clouded
bows
and
bands
of
satin
it
was
a
lovely
frock
and
just
suited
patty
s
blonde
fairness
she
went
around
among
her
mother
s
friends
greeting
them
with
pretty
courtesy
and
chatting
easily
with
them
but
after
a
time
her
own
young
friends
came
and
with
the
two
farringtons
and
kenneth
harper
patty
went
to
the
library
where
they
could
be
by
themselves
soon
hepworth
came
bringing
christine
farley
christine
had
been
in
new
york
only
a
few
weeks
but
already
she
had
lost
much
of
her
painful
shyness
and
though
still
easily
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
strangers
she
usually
managed
to
preserve
her
poise
and
she
greeted
patty
with
shining
eyes
for
the
southern
girl
was
warmly
affectionate
and
adored
patty
and
are
you
all
settled
now
christine
and
ready
to
receive
callers
patty
asked
yes
i
am
i
have
a
lovely
room
not
large
but
sunny
and
pleasant
and
i
will
gladly
welcome
you
there
at
any
time
and
and
bosworth
are
such
kind
people
oh
i
shall
be
very
happy
and
the
work
asked
hepworth
how
does
that
come
on
it
s
all
right
said
christine
soberly
but
nodding
her
head
with
satisfaction
though
shy
in
society
she
was
most
practical
and
unembarrassed
about
her
art
study
not
but
perfectly
aware
of
the
extent
of
her
own
talent
and
also
of
her
own
ignorance
and
she
had
a
calm
determination
to
improve
the
one
and
conquer
the
other
christine
was
pretty
in
her
soft
southern
way
she
was
small
and
dainty
in
all
her
effects
her
oval
face
was
serious
almost
sad
in
its
expression
but
if
she
were
interested
in
a
subject
it
would
light
up
into
sudden
beauty
her
clothes
betokened
her
artistic
tastes
and
she
never
wore
dresses
of
the
fashionable
type
but
soft
clinging
gowns
in
dull
pastel
colours
a
bit
of
old
embroidery
or
unusual
jewelry
added
an
effective
touch
and
christine
always
looked
well
dressed
though
her
clothes
cost
far
less
than
patty
s
the
two
girls
were
absolutely
unlike
and
yet
they
were
fast
becoming
great
friends
but
christine
possessed
almost
no
sense
of
humour
and
patty
feared
she
could
never
be
really
chummy
with
any
one
who
lacked
that
elise
was
not
very
fond
of
christine
for
she
didn
t
understand
her
at
all
and
secretly
thought
her
rather
stupid
but
the
boys
roger
and
kenneth
liked
the
southern
maiden
with
her
soft
pretty
accent
and
of
course
hepworth
was
her
friend
so
the
whole
group
was
fairly
congenial
and
they
formed
a
pleasant
little
circle
in
the
library
to
drink
their
tea
sorry
i
m
late
said
a
cheery
voice
and
philip
van
reypen
joined
them
oh
how
do
you
do
cried
patty
jumping
up
to
greet
him
miss
farley
may
i
present
van
reypen
i
think
the
rest
are
all
there
were
general
greetings
all
round
and
then
philip
took
his
place
with
the
rest
my
aunt
is
here
he
said
to
patty
a
little
later
perhaps
she
wants
to
meet
miss
so
she
shall
said
patty
remembering
miss
van
reypen
s
offer
to
help
christine
in
some
way
will
you
have
tea
will
i
have
tea
echoed
philip
that
s
exactly
what
i
m
here
for
please
then
here
you
are
said
patty
handing
him
a
cup
and
incidentally
do
you
know
how
a
bookworm
goes
through
a
book
ugh
what
an
unpleasant
subject
said
elise
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
patty
do
talk
of
something
i
can
t
said
patty
solemnly
i
know
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
a
do
you
mean
a
real
bookworm
or
a
studious
person
asked
hepworth
who
often
took
patty
s
questions
very
seriously
i
mean
entomological
sort
said
patty
and
i
m
in
dead
earnest
who
knows
anything
about
the
bookworms
that
really
destroy
books
i
do
announced
kenneth
but
nothing
would
induce
me
to
tell
theirs
is
a
secret
history
and
not
to
be
made
known
to
a
curious
pooh
said
roger
that
s
all
bluff
patty
he
doesn
t
really
know
anything
about
the
beasts
now
i
do
a
bookworm
is
a
no
said
philip
the
book
is
the
bookworm
s
grub
and
pretty
dry
fodder
he
must
often
find
i
know
what
you
re
going
to
do
patty
said
kenneth
in
an
aggrieved
voice
you
re
going
to
set
up
a
pair
of
pet
bookworms
in
place
of
darby
and
juliet
please
understand
that
i
am
distinctly
offended
and
i
prophesy
that
your
new
pets
won
t
be
half
as
interesting
as
the
wrong
again
ken
returned
patty
no
new
pets
could
ever
be
so
dear
to
my
heart
as
those
sweet
lovely
goldfish
but
if
you
people
don
t
tell
me
about
bookworms
i
ll
have
to
look
in
the
encyclop√¶dia
and
if
there
s
anything
i
do
hate
it
s
that
christine
aren
t
you
up
on
bookworms
no
said
christine
in
a
shy
whisper
she
couldn
t
yet
become
accustomed
to
the
quick
repartee
and
merry
nonsense
of
these
northern
young
people
i
used
to
have
a
pet
bookworm
began
roger
but
he
got
into
a
and
died
of
tell
us
what
it
s
all
about
patty
said
hepworth
seeing
she
was
really
serious
in
her
questioning
why
it
s
a
puzzle
sort
of
conundrum
this
is
it
suppose
a
history
in
three
volumes
is
placed
upon
a
bookshelf
suppose
each
volume
contains
just
one
hundred
pages
and
suppose
a
bookworm
starting
at
page
one
of
volume
one
bores
right
straight
through
the
books
covers
and
all
to
the
last
page
of
volume
three
how
many
leaves
does
he
go
through
not
counting
or
covers
patty
i
m
surprised
at
you
said
roger
that
s
too
easy
he
goes
through
the
three
hundred
pages
of
it
does
seem
so
said
patty
with
a
perplexed
look
but
as
you
say
that
s
too
easy
there
must
be
a
catch
or
a
quibble
well
said
elise
i
never
could
do
a
puzzle
i
don
t
know
why
a
hen
goes
across
the
road
or
when
is
a
door
not
a
door
but
you
re
a
born
puzzlist
patty
and
if
you
can
t
guess
it
nobody
elise
you
re
a
sweet
thing
and
most
complimentary
but
i
know
you
have
no
talent
for
puzzles
so
my
dear
child
i
m
not
asking
you
but
you
men
of
brains
and
intellect
can
t
you
help
me
out
i
m
sure
there
s
another
answer
but
i
can
t
think
what
it
would
why
patty
said
hepworth
thoughtfully
i
think
roger
is
right
if
the
bookworm
goes
through
all
three
volumes
he
must
go
through
three
hundred
pages
mustn
t
he
no
indeed
cried
christine
her
shyness
forgotten
and
her
eyes
shining
as
she
constructed
the
picture
of
the
books
in
her
mind
s
eye
wait
a
minute
yes
i
m
sure
i
m
right
he
only
goes
through
one
hundred
pages
he
goes
only
through
the
second
volume
you
see
elise
looked
at
christine
a
little
disdainfully
you
don
t
seem
to
have
heard
the
conditions
she
said
the
bookworm
begins
at
the
first
page
of
the
first
volume
and
goes
through
to
the
end
of
the
last
yes
i
heard
that
said
christine
flushing
at
elise
s
tone
which
was
distinctly
supercilious
but
don
t
you
see
when
the
books
are
set
up
on
a
shelf
in
the
usual
manner
the
first
page
of
the
first
volume
is
on
the
right
just
up
against
the
last
page
of
the
second
nonsense
cried
elise
but
it
is
so
miss
farley
exclaimed
philip
van
reypen
you
ve
struck
it
look
people
he
turned
to
a
bookcase
and
indicated
three
volumes
of
a
set
of
books
now
see
the
first
page
of
volume
one
is
right
against
the
last
page
of
volume
two
so
the
first
page
of
volume
two
is
up
against
the
last
page
of
volume
three
now
what
does
bookworm
do
he
starts
here
at
the
first
page
of
volume
one
he
doesn
t
go
backward
so
he
doesn
t
go
through
volume
one
at
all
he
goes
through
volume
two
and
as
soon
as
he
strikes
volume
three
he
strikes
it
at
the
last
page
and
his
task
is
done
his
journey
is
over
he
has
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
the
original
question
see
they
did
see
after
awhile
but
it
was
only
the
ocular
demonstration
that
proved
it
for
the
facts
were
hard
to
describe
in
words
elise
flatly
refused
to
see
it
saying
it
made
her
head
ache
to
try
to
understand
it
but
it
was
very
clever
of
miss
farley
to
reason
it
out
so
soon
said
philip
yes
wasn
t
it
agreed
patty
i
didn
t
know
you
had
a
bent
for
puzzles
i
haven
t
but
that
doesn
t
seem
to
me
like
a
puzzle
i
can
t
do
arithmetical
problems
or
guess
charades
at
all
but
this
seems
to
me
a
picture
of
still
life
i
can
see
the
insides
of
the
books
in
my
mind
and
they
are
wrong
end
to
is
compared
to
the
way
we
read
them
you
see
they
really
stand
in
the
bookcase
with
the
pages
numbered
bravo
christine
so
they
do
said
hepworth
patty
that
s
the
answer
but
i
confess
i
was
way
off
so
say
we
all
of
us
chimed
in
roger
i
can
only
see
through
it
part
of
the
time
even
i
think
it
a
most
clever
catch
question
said
philip
van
reypen
where
did
you
find
it
miss
fairfield
in
a
little
book
of
puzzles
i
m
trying
to
guess
them
let
me
help
you
won
t
you
i
m
a
shark
on
puzzles
i
slipped
up
on
this
one
i
admit
but
i
can
do
the
transposed
i
am
a
fish
kind
just
ah
but
my
bookful
isn
t
that
kind
they
re
all
of
a
catchy
or
difficult
well
let
me
try
to
help
mayn
t
i
van
reypen
s
voice
was
gay
and
wheedlesome
and
patty
responded
by
saying
perhaps
some
time
but
now
i
must
take
miss
farley
in
to
see
van
these
two
were
mutually
pleased
with
each
other
as
patty
felt
sure
they
would
be
van
reypen
assumed
her
kindest
demeanour
for
she
saw
christine
was
excessively
shy
she
talked
pleasantly
to
her
drawing
her
out
concerning
her
life
work
and
her
life
plans
and
ended
by
asking
the
girl
to
call
on
her
some
afternoon
soon
then
she
went
away
and
patty
drew
christine
into
a
corner
to
congratulate
her
it
s
fine
she
declared
if
van
reypen
takes
you
up
she
ll
do
lovely
things
for
you
she
ll
have
you
at
her
house
and
you
ll
meet
lovely
people
and
she
ll
take
you
to
the
opera
oh
christine
do
be
nice
to
of
course
i
shall
i
liked
her
at
once
she
isn
t
a
bit
patronising
but
patty
your
friend
elise
is
i
don
t
know
why
but
she
doesn
t
like
nonsense
christine
don
t
you
go
around
with
thinks
like
that
under
your
pompadour
elise
is
all
right
she
isn
t
such
a
sunny
bunny
as
i
am
but
she
s
a
lot
wiser
and
better
in
many
no
she
isn
t
she
s
selfish
and
jealous
but
i
m
going
to
be
nice
to
her
and
perhaps
i
can
make
her
like
me
after
i
should
say
you
could
everybody
likes
you
and
anybody
who
doesn

soon
will
chapter
ii
an
able
helper
nearly
all
the
guests
had
left
the
fairfield
house
after
nan
s
pleasant
afternoon
tea
philip
van
reypen
had
escorted
his
aunt
out
to
her
carriage
and
she
had
driven
away
while
the
young
man
returned
for
a
few
moments
further
chat
with
his
hostess
though
he
and
nan
had
met
but
a
few
times
they
had
become
rather
chummy
which
however
was
not
unusual
for
him
if
he
liked
anybody
young
van
reypen
was
of
a
gay
and
social
nature
and
made
friends
easily
by
his
sheer
he
admired
fairfield
very
much
but
even
more
he
admired
patty
ever
since
he
had
met
her
unexpectedly
on
his
aunt
s
staircase
he
had
thought
her
the
prettiest
and
sweetest
girl
he
had
ever
seen
so
he
was
making
every
endeavour
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
and
being
of
rather
astute
observation
he
concluded
it
wise
to
make
friends
with
the
whole
fairfield
family
so
the
big
handsome
chap
went
back
to
the
and
dropped
on
a
sofa
beside
nan
it
s
awfully
cold
out
he
observed
plaintively
is
it
returned
his
hostess
innocently
yes
i
hate
to
go
out
in
the
but
you
have
to
go
sooner
or
yes
but
it
may
be
warmer
on
the
contrary
it
will
probably
grow
oh
do
you
think
so
but
then
again
it
may
not
and
i
m
quite
willing
to
take
the
mr
van
reypen
i
do
believe
you
re
hinting
for
an
invitation
to
stay
here
to
dinner
oh
fairfield
how
clever
you
are
how
could
you
possibly
guess
that
now
nan
laughed
and
hesitated
she
liked
the
young
man
but
she
wasn
t
sure
that
patty
wanted
him
there
patty
was
developing
into
a
somewhat
decided
young
person
and
liked
to
make
her
own
plans
and
nan
well
knew
that
patty
was
the
real
magnet
that
drew
van
reypen
so
often
to
the
house
what
do
you
think
she
said
as
the
girl
came
into
the
room
this
young
man
is
giving
me
to
understand
that
if
he
were
urged
he
would
dine
here
of
course
it
would
require
a
great
deal
of
most
insistent
urging
put
in
philip
don
t
let
s
urge
him
said
patty
but
the
merry
smile
she
flashed
at
the
young
man
belied
her
words
if
you
smile
like
that
i
ll
do
the
urging
myself
he
cried
please
fairfield
let
me
stay
i
ll
be
as
good
as
what
say
you
patty
asked
nan
he
may
stay
rejoined
patty
if
he
ll
help
me
with
my
work
on
those
puzzles
well
i
just
guess
i
will
i
ll
do
them
all
for
you
where
s
your
slate
and
pencil
oh
not
yet
laughed
patty
we
won
t
do
those
until
after
why
do
you
do
them
at
all
asked
nan
and
what
are
they
anyway
i
ll
tell
you
began
patty
no
i
won
t
either
at
least
not
now
it
s
a
grand
project
really
great
scheme
and
i
ll
unfold
it
at
dinner
then
father
can
hear
about
it
so
later
when
the
quartette
were
seated
around
the
dinner
table
patty
announced
that
she
would
tell
of
her
great
project
you
see
she
began
it
s
a
sort
of
advertisement
for
a
big
don
t
try
to
float
a
company
patty
advised
her
father
it
s
too
big
a
project
for
a
young
i
m
not
going
to
do
that
daddy
fairfield
but
i
begin
to
think
that
what
i
am
going
to
do
is
almost
as
hard
you
see
this
big
company
has
issued
a
book
of
a
hundred
puzzles
now
whoever
guesses
all
those
puzzles
correctly
will
get
the
prize
and
prize
is
a
lovely
electric
runabout
and
i
want
it
hevings
hevings
murmured
van
reypen
she
wants
an
electric
runabout
why
infant
you
ll
break
your
blessed
neck
indeed
i
won
t
i
guess
i
ve
brains
enough
to
run
an
electric
car
if
i
guess
those
puzzles
that
ll
prove
it
they
re
fearfully
hard
listen
to
this
one
when
did
london
begin
with
an
l
and
end
with
an
e
that
is
hard
said
nan
it
must
be
some
foreign
name
for
london
but
won
t
no
said
patty
i
thought
of
that
i
expect
it
s
some
old
or
hardicanute
i
expect
it
s
rubbish
said
her
father
patty
don
t
begin
on
these
things
you
ll
wear
yourself
out
i
know
how
you
hammer
at
anything
once
you
begin
it
and
you
ll
be
sitting
up
nights
with
these
foolish
questions
until
you
re
really
oh
no
i
won
t
father
and
beside
van
reypen
is
going
to
help
me
angel
child
said
philip
looking
at
her
with
a
patronising
air
if
all
your
questions
are
as
easy
as
that
one
you
just
quoted
your
task
is
already
why
do
you
know
the
answer
cried
patty
oh
tell
it
to
me
i
ve
puzzled
so
hard
over
it
it
s
a
quibble
of
course
sort
of
catch
do
you
see
and
the
answer
is
that
london
always
began
with
an
l
and
always
began
with
an
oh
said
patty
catching
the
point
at
once
i
should
have
known
that
i
pride
myself
on
guessing
those
catch
you
were
clever
to
guess
it
so
quickly
van
reypen
said
fairfield
or
have
you
heard
it
before
not
exactly
in
that
form
no
but
so
many
quibbles
are
built
like
they
are
agreed
patty
i
ought
to
have
known
it
well
i
rather
think
there
are
some
others
you
won
t
guess
so
how
many
have
you
done
asked
nan
i
ve
done
about
out
of
the
hundred
some
were
dead
easy
and
some
i
had
to
work
on
like
the
but
patty
began
her
father
what
could
you
do
with
a
motor
car
of
your
own
you
don
t
want
indeed
i
do
why
i
ll
have
perfectly
elegant
times
scooting
around
by
but
you
can
t
go
by
yourself
in
the
new
york
streets
i
won
t
allow
no
daddy
dear
not
here
in
the
city
perhaps
but
if
we
go
away
for
the
summer
to
some
nice
country
place
where
there
s
nothing
in
the
road
but
cows
then
i
could
run
it
alone
or
with
some
nice
girl
by
my
or
with
some
nice
boy
by
your
side
put
in
philip
i
m
an
awfully
nice
boy
all
if
you
help
me
win
it
i
ll
give
you
a
ride
in
it
said
patty
but
i
haven
t
won
it
no
and
you
won
t
said
her
father
those
contests
are
just
planned
for
an
advertisement
the
prize
goes
to
the
daughter
of
the
chief
oh
father
fairfield
what
a
mean
thing
to
say
you
don
t
know
that
that
s
so
at
all
now
i
believe
in
their
so
do
i
said
nan
that
isn
t
like
you
fred
to
express
such
an
unfounded
well
perhaps
i
spoke
too
hastily
but
still
patty
i
don
t
think
you
want
the
thing
if
you
get
it
i
ll
sell
it
for
you
and
give
you
the
no
i
want
it
for
itself
alone
oh
father
think
what
fun
i
d
have
spinning
around
the
country
wouldn
t
we
nan
yes
indeed
i
think
it
would
be
great
fun
and
they
say
those
electrics
are
easy
to
pooh
as
easy
as
pie
declared
patty
and
anyway
i
ran
a
big
touring
car
once
in
france
a
big
gasoline
one
an
electric
is
nothing
to
what
do
you
do
to
make
it
go
asked
her
father
smiling
oh
you
just
release
the
pawl
that
engages
the
clutch
that
holds
the
lever
that
sustains
the
spring
that
lets
go
the
there
you
are
patty
where
did
you
learn
all
that
jargon
tisn
t
jargon
it
s
sense
and
now
my
dear
ones
will
you
all
help
me
in
my
stupendous
undertaking
for
when
i
engage
in
a
contest
i
want
to
is
it
winning
if
you
have
so
much
help
teased
her
father
yes
it
is
the
contest
is
to
get
the
answers
to
those
hundred
questions
and
send
them
in
it
doesn
t
matter
where
you
get
your
answers
you
don
t
want
to
enter
the
contest
yourself
do
you
van
reypen
no
no
fair
lady
i
would
but
be
thy
humble
knight
and
render
such
poor
assistance
as
i
all
right
then
right
after
dinner
we
ll
tackle
that
book
of
and
so
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening
patty
and
philip
van
reypen
exerted
the
full
force
of
their
intellects
to
unravel
the
knotty
tangles
propounded
by
the
little
book
and
fairfield
tried
for
a
time
but
soon
grew
weary
of
the
difficult
game
now
take
this
one
said
patty
to
her
colleague
how
do
you
swallow
a
door
bolt
it
he
replied
promptly
that
s
an
old
i
ought
to
have
guessed
that
myself
said
patty
i
m
so
fond
of
bolt
it
isn
t
exactly
no
s
pose
not
it
s
just
rude
diction
now
answer
this
the
poor
have
two
the
rich
have
none
schoolboys
have
several
you
have
well
that
s
one
of
a
class
of
puzzles
to
which
the
answer
is
usually
some
letter
of
the
oh
of
course
cried
patty
quickly
it
is
there
i
guessed
that
don
t
you
claim
it
of
course
you
did
now
you
know
this
one
about
the
headless
man
don
t
you
it
s
a
no
i
don
t
i
can
t
see
any
sense
to
it
at
read
so
patty
read
aloud
a
headless
man
had
a
letter
to
write
it
was
read
by
one
who
had
lost
his
sight
the
dumb
repeated
it
word
for
word
and
he
who
was
deaf
both
listened
and
and
you
don
t
know
that
asked
philip
no
the
conditions
are
oh
no
they
re
not
they
only
seem
so
the
answer
is
you
see
the
headless
man
could
write
nothing
that
s
naught
zero
or
the
then
the
blind
man
of
course
could
read
nothing
the
dumb
man
could
repeat
nothing
and
the
deaf
man
heard
pooh
i
don
t
think
that
s
very
not
modernly
clever
but
it
s
a
good
example
of
the
gracious
what
a
lot
you
know
about
puzzles
have
you
always
studied
yes
i
loved
them
as
a
child
and
i
love
them
still
i
think
this
whole
book
is
great
fun
but
we
ll
strike
some
really
difficult
ones
yet
here
s
one
i
ve
never
seen
before
i
ll
read
it
and
see
if
we
either
of
us
get
a
clue
what
is
it
men
and
women
all
despise
yet
one
and
all
alike
as
highly
prize
what
kings
possess
not
yet
full
sure
am
i
that
for
that
luxury
they
often
sigh
what
never
was
for
sale
yet
any
day
the
thrifty
housewife
will
give
some
away
the
farmer
needs
it
for
his
growing
corn
the
tired
husbandman
delights
to
own
the
very
thing
for
any
sick
friend
s
room
it
coming
silent
as
spring
s
early
bloom
a
great
soft
yielding
thing
that
no
one
fears
a
tiny
thing
oft
wet
with
mother
s
tears
a
thing
so
holy
that
we
often
wear
it
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
s
cold
well
remarked
patty
complacently
as
he
finished
reading
i
ve
guessed
you
have
you
bright
little
thing
i
haven
t
now
don
t
tell
me
wait
a
minute
no
i
can
t
catch
it
tell
me
the
why
it
s
an
old
shoe
said
patty
laughing
see
how
it
all
fits
yes
it
s
rattling
clever
i
like
that
one
did
you
guess
it
as
i
read
yes
it
seemed
to
dawn
on
me
as
you
went
along
they
often
do
that
if
i
read
them
slowly
now
here
s
another
old
one
i
ll
read
and
you
guess
if
it
be
true
as
welshmen
say
honour
depends
on
pedigree
then
stand
the
and
let
me
have
fair
play
for
though
you
boast
thro
ages
dark
your
pedigree
from
noah
s
ark
i
too
was
with
him
there
for
i
was
adam
adam
i
and
i
was
eve
and
eve
was
i
in
spite
of
wind
and
weather
but
mark
was
not
i
neither
was
adam
i
unless
they
were
together
suppose
then
eve
and
adam
with
all
my
heart
but
if
they
re
walking
there
ends
all
simile
for
tho
i
ve
tongue
and
often
talk
and
tho
i
ve
feet
yet
when
i
walk
there
is
an
end
of
me
not
such
an
end
but
i
have
breath
therefore
to
such
a
kind
of
death
i
have
but
small
objection
i
may
be
turk
i
may
be
jew
and
tho
a
christian
yet
tis
true
i
die
by
resurrection
oh
i
know
that
one
it
s
a
very
old
one
and
it
s
capital
the
answer
is
a
bedfellow
see
how
clever
it
is
if
i
walk
it
puts
an
end
to
me
and
i
die
by
resurrection
oh
that
s
a
good
one
but
you
see
this
one
the
golden
head
and
the
dark
one
bent
over
the
book
together
and
read
these
lines
i
sit
stern
as
a
rock
when
i
m
raising
the
wind
but
the
storm
once
abated
i
m
gentle
and
kind
i
have
kings
at
my
feet
who
await
but
my
nod
to
kneel
down
in
the
dust
on
the
ground
i
have
trod
though
seen
by
the
world
i
am
known
but
to
few
the
gentile
deserts
me
i
am
pork
to
the
jew
i
never
have
passed
but
one
night
in
the
dark
and
that
was
like
noah
alone
in
the
ark
my
weight
is
three
pounds
my
length
is
one
mile
and
when
you
have
guessed
me
you
ll
say
with
a
smile
that
my
first
and
my
last
are
the
best
of
this
now
that
s
an
old
favourite
with
all
said
philip
as
they
finished
reading
it
and
it
has
never
been
satisfactorily
guessed
the
usual
answer
is
the
crown
of
england
but
that
doesn
t
seem
right
to
me
however
i
know
no
but
how
does
the
crown
of
england
fit
all
the
requirements
said
patty
looking
over
the
text
well
this
isle
is
supposed
to
mean
great
britain
and
i
believe
it
is
a
historic
fact
that
the
crown
spent
one
night
in
a
big
chest
called
the
what
was
it
there
for
oh
between
the
two
reigns
of
william
iv
and
victoria
there
was
a
delay
of
some
hours
in
the
night
before
she
really
received
the
crown
and
it
was
then
placed
in
the
the
weight
of
the
crown
is
about
three
pounds
and
they
say
if
drawn
out
into
gold
wire
it
would
stretch
a
it
would
depend
on
the
thickness
of
the
wire
commented
patty
sagely
so
it
would
i
don
t
like
the
answer
anyway
but
i
can
t
think
of
a
better
one
let
s
try
some
easy
take
this
mathematical
one
then
divide
nine
into
two
equal
parts
that
added
together
will
make
for
some
time
philip
worked
over
this
he
tried
arabic
figures
printed
words
and
roman
numerals
at
last
he
exclaimed
ah
now
we
have
it
have
you
really
done
it
cried
patty
yes
look
i
write
the
roman
nine
ix
you
know
then
i
fold
the
paper
crosswise
right
through
the
middle
now
what
do
you
read
on
this
side
iv
said
patty
that
s
yes
now
i
turn
the
folded
paper
over
and
what
do
you
read
vi
that
s
yes
and
six
and
four
are
ten
though
as
you
know
we
divided
our
nine
into
exactly
equal
parts
by
that
crossways
fold
through
the
that
s
a
good
one
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
but
i
don
t
see
how
you
guessed
but
see
that
you
re
not
to
guess
any
more
said
fairfield
coming
into
the
library
and
looking
at
the
absorbed
puzzlers
i
m
going
to
take
you
both
to
the
where
fairfield
will
give
you
a
very
small
bit
of
very
light
supper
and
then
van
reypen
i
shall
send
my
daughter
to
her
and
but
i
m
not
a
bit
sleepy
father
dear
protested
patty
no
matter
my
child
if
you
go
into
this
ridiculous
game
you
must
promise
me
not
to
overdo
it
i
will
not
allow
you
to
work
late
at
night
on
these
all
right
daddykins
i
promise
wow
but
i
m
hungry
come
on
van
reypen
let
s
see
what
nan
will
give
us
to
support
our
famishing
to
the
they
went
and
nan
s
gay
little
supper
soon
brushed
the
cobwebs
out
of
patty
s
brain
but
she
was
well
satisfied
with
her
first
evening
of
real
work
on
her
puzzle
chapter
iii
a
lecture
patricia
said
fairfield
one
morning
at
the
patty
gave
a
great
jump
clasped
her
hands
to
her
breast
dramatically
and
exclaimed
oh
my
gracious
goodness
do
you
call
me
that
for
because
went
on
her
father
i
m
going
to
lecture
you
and
i
m
in
a
very
serious
proceed
frederick
fairfield
esquire
and
patty
assumed
an
expression
of
rapt
attention
and
excessive
meekness
well
to
put
it
in
a
few
words
i
won
t
have
that
young
van
reypen
hanging
around
here
so
much
oh
is
that
all
well
you
re
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
you
should
advise
him
of
that
fact
not
incidentally
as
i
go
along
consider
yourself
reproved
for
that
awful
bit
of
slang
but
now
i
m
concerned
with
this
other
subject
it
won
t
be
necessary
for
me
to
speak
to
the
young
man
for
i
m
telling
you
that
you
must
discourage
his
attentions
somewhat
he
comes
too
i
think
so
too
agreed
patty
calmly
but
it
isn
t
he
comes
to
see
it
s
oh
patty
how
silly
exclaimed
nan
laughing
and
blushing
a
little
yes
it
is
daddy
nan
encourages
him
something
scan
lous
i
don
t
wonder
you
kick
object
patty
not
yes
sir
object
is
just
what
i
patty
s
demure
air
made
her
father
laugh
but
he
returned
to
his
theme
as
you
know
child
i
like
to
have
you
amused
and
happy
and
i
like
to
have
your
young
friends
come
to
see
you
but
this
chap
has
already
been
here
three
evenings
this
week
and
it
s
only
that
leaves
him
just
three
more
to
come
doesn
t
it
said
patty
counting
on
her
fingers
indeed
it
does
not
if
he
keeps
this
up
he
ll
be
forbidden
the
house
oh
what
a
pity
and
he
such
a
nice
young
man
with
rosy
cheeks
and
curly
hair
father
you
re
cruel
to
your
only
child
now
patty
behave
yourself
you
re
too
young
to
have
a
man
calling
on
you
so
often
and
i
really
object
to
i
will
be
good
dear
mother
i
heard
a
sweet
child
say
hummed
patty
and
i
ll
tell
you
frankly
my
stern
parent
that
if
you
ll
only
let
the
van
reypen
villain
stay
by
me
until
i
get
these
puzzles
done
i
don
t
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
after
oh
patty
cried
nan
how
ungrateful
ungrateful
perhaps
to
that
bold
bad
young
man
but
obedient
to
my
dear
kind
old
when
patty
was
in
this
amiably
foolish
mood
she
was
incorrigible
so
fairfield
said
all
right
my
lady
let
him
come
a
few
times
to
work
out
those
pestilential
puzzles
and
then
i
shall
hold
you
to
your
promise
to
cut
his
is
he
really
as
bad
as
all
that
father
asked
patty
in
awestruck
tones
he
isn
t
bad
at
all
he
s
a
most
estimable
and
exemplary
young
man
but
i
won
t
have
anybody
calling
on
you
three
nights
in
one
week
at
your
age
it
s
out
of
the
question
kenneth
doesn
but
ken
is
so
no
it
s
because
he
has
some
idea
of
the
and
hasn
t
van
reypen
idea
of
the
proprieties
patty
s
eyes
opened
wide
at
this
awful
suggestion
yes
he
has
and
fairfield
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
or
he
would
have
if
you
d
let
him
it
s
all
your
fault
patty
you
drag
him
here
to
mull
over
those
idiotic
questions
i
drag
him
here
oh
father
what
a
rudeness
well
i
simply
have
his
help
on
the
rest
of
those
puzzles
how
would
it
be
if
you
engaged
him
as
my
assistant
and
paid
him
a
salary
would
that
help
matters
how
many
of
your
precious
puzzles
are
done
out
of
the
how
many
have
you
solved
yourself
about
then
that
man
did
nineteen
for
you
yes
and
if
he
hadn
t
i
could
have
guessed
them
oh
he
clever
and
when
do
the
answers
have
to
be
sent
in
april
h
m
an
appropriate
day
well
patty
as
your
heart
is
so
set
on
this
thing
carry
it
through
but
don
t
ever
begin
on
such
a
task
again
now
van
reypen
may
help
you
if
you
wish
but
i
mean
it
when
i
say
he
must
not
come
here
to
call
more
than
twice
in
one
all
right
agreed
patty
cheerfully
may
i
send
him
some
puzzles
to
guess
father
well
i
won
t
have
you
writing
to
him
not
letters
i
mean
but
if
you
can
t
guess
a
puzzle
you
may
send
it
to
him
and
i
trust
you
not
to
let
this
permission
develop
into
a
no
sir
i
won
t
said
patty
but
after
fairfield
had
gone
away
the
girl
turned
to
nan
with
a
perplexed
look
whatever
ails
father
she
said
to
talk
to
me
like
that
he
s
right
patty
you
don
t
see
the
difference
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
your
friendship
for
kenneth
and
roger
which
dates
from
your
schooldays
and
your
sudden
acquaintance
with
van
reypen
who
is
older
and
who
is
a
far
more
experienced
man
of
the
but
hepworth
is
a
lot
older
than
van
reypen
and
nobody
objects
to
his
coming
mr
hepworth
is
an
old
friend
of
your
father
s
and
has
always
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
well
these
distinctions
are
too
much
for
me
declared
patty
but
i
don
t
care
a
about
philip
van
reypen
personally
if
i
can
just
have
his
help
on
my
remaining
problems
i
ll
cheerfully
bid
him
farewell
there
was
no
mistaking
patty
s
sincerity
and
nan
felt
decidedly
relieved
for
she
and
her
husband
had
feared
that
patty
was
taking
too
deep
a
personal
interest
in
the
attractive
young
millionaire
all
right
girlie
suppose
then
you
send
him
two
or
three
of
your
and
ask
him
to
come
around
say
on
monday
next
that
will
convey
a
gentle
hint
not
to
come
that
s
a
long
time
said
patty
dubiously
but
if
i
need
to
i
can
send
him
more
puzzles
before
patty
ran
away
to
her
study
and
spent
the
morning
working
on
her
puzzles
it
was
by
no
means
drudgery
for
she
enjoyed
it
all
the
puzzles
were
of
all
sorts
from
charades
and
square
words
to
the
most
abstruse
problems
she
solved
several
and
four
she
gave
up
as
impossible
for
her
ever
to
guess
these
she
concluded
to
send
to
van
reypen
but
it
was
more
difficult
than
she
anticipated
to
compose
a
note
to
go
with
them
she
had
no
wish
to
disobey
her
father
s
commands
even
in
spirit
and
wanted
to
write
an
impersonal
letter
such
as
he
would
approve
but
for
some
reason
she
couldn
t
accomplish
it
philip
van
reypen
was
himself
so
straightforward
and
so
quick
to
see
through
any
subterfuge
that
all
the
notes
she
wrote
seemed
to
her
artificial
and
insincere
she
tore
them
up
one
after
another
and
at
last
seizing
her
pen
again
she
wrote
rapidly
dear
van
reypen
it
s
no
use
i
ve
written
a
dozen
notes
and
torn
them
up
trying
to
imply
or
hint
politely
what
i
prefer
to
say
right
out
it
seems
my
parents
think
you
come
here
too
often
and
i
daresay
you
think
so
too
so
at
their
command
you
re
not
to
come
again
till
next
monday
come
at
four
o
clock
and
ask
to
stay
to
dinner
i
enclose
some
puzzles
that
i
hope
you
can
solve
i
can
t
sincerely
yours
patricia
there
said
patty
to
herself
as
she
read
it
over
i
think
that
would
do
credit
to
a
young
lady
s
model
letter
it
tells
the
truth
without
subterfuge
and
it
certainly
does
not
invite
the
correspondence
father
is
so
afraid
of
now
i
m
not
going
to
touch
these
old
puzzles
again
or
i
ll
have
brain
failure
i
think
i
ll
go
and
practise
some
new
songs
music
hath
charms
to
sooth
a
puzzled
so
patty
warbled
away
for
an
hour
or
so
in
her
clear
sweet
voice
and
nan
came
down
to
the
music
room
to
listen
oh
patty
she
said
if
you
d
put
half
the
time
and
pains
on
your
music
that
you
do
on
those
foolish
puzzles
you
d
be
a
great
singer
think
so
nannikins
i
doubt
yes
you
would
you
have
a
lovely
voice
but
it
needs
more
training
and
lots
of
well
it
won
t
get
it
life
s
too
short
and
too
nobody
cares
for
parlour
tricks
of
a
musical
nature
i
sing
well
enough
to
entertain
the
fairfield
family
and
that
s
all
i
care
patty
have
you
no
ambition
yes
but
my
ambitions
are
sensible
if
i
practised
four
hours
a
day
i
d
still
have
only
a
small
parlour
voice
a
concert
voice
and
there
d
be
four
hours
a
day
wasted
and
days
are
short
anyway
i
m
going
to
christine
s
this
afternoon
do
you
want
the
motor
why
yes
i
did
expect
to
make
some
oh
well
you
can
drop
me
on
the
way
but
won
t
it
be
fun
nan
when
i
get
my
own
little
runabout
i
ll
be
quite
independent
of
miller
and
the
big
you
can
t
use
it
alone
in
the
oh
yes
i
could
just
to
fly
over
to
christine
s
in
the
afternoon
or
something
like
that
father
would
kick
at
first
but
he
d
soon
get
used
to
you
do
wind
that
poor
man
around
your
finger
good
thing
too
if
i
didn
t
he
d
wind
me
around
his
finger
so
as
it
is
i
have
the
best
of
it
but
i
m
not
at
all
sure
i
ll
catch
that
runabout
after
all
the
first
of
april
draweth
near
and
many
of
those
silly
problems
refuse
to
let
themselves
be
i
hope
you
will
get
it
after
you
ve
worked
so
i
hope
so
too
but
hopes
don
t
solve
anagrams
and
oh
well
if
you
don
t
get
it
there
s
always
room
for
you
in
the
big
car
what
time
do
you
want
to
go
to
christine
s
about
four
she
won
t
be
home
till
then
does
that
suit
your
plans
perfectly
my
so
at
four
o
clock
nan
left
patty
at
christine
s
new
home
it
was
not
a
typical
but
an
apartment
occupied
by
two
elderly
people
who
had
a
room
to
spare
which
seemed
just
right
for
the
young
art
student
even
in
the
short
time
she
had
been
there
christine
had
done
much
to
make
the
plain
room
more
attractive
and
patty
had
helped
for
many
of
the
comforts
that
had
been
added
had
been
her
gifts
a
growing
palm
and
a
smaller
bowl
of
ferns
looked
thrifty
and
and
a
large
jar
of
exquisite
pink
roses
gave
the
place
a
gala
air
what
lovely
roses
exclaimed
patty
sniffing
daintily
at
one
of
them
yes
aren
t
they
said
christine
mr
hepworth
sent
them
he
sends
them
every
week
isn
t
he
kind
yes
but
no
kinder
than
he
ought
to
be
everybody
ought
to
be
good
to
you
why
oh
because
you
re
so
sweet
and
good
yourself
and
you
work
so
hard
and
you
never
complain
you
re
so
patty
added
the
last
clause
because
her
former
words
brought
a
pink
glow
to
christine
s
cheeks
and
a
shining
light
to
her
dark
eyes
and
she
looked
indeed
beautiful
i
do
work
hard
but
patty
i
m
winning
out
i
ve
already
had
some
illustrations
accepted
by
a
good
magazine
and
i
ve
orders
for
two
magazine
fine
why
christine
you
ve
arrived
not
quite
that
but
i
m
steadily
going
ahead
i
say
that
quite
without
conceit
it
s
simply
that
i
m
learning
how
to
use
the
talent
i
you
dear
cried
patty
as
if
any
one
could
imagine
conceited
and
of
course
you
re
going
ahead
and
patty
van
reypen
is
so
good
to
me
i
don
t
understand
it
why
she
fairly
showers
me
with
i
understand
it
van
reypen
is
very
eccentric
if
she
dislikes
people
she
can
t
be
caustic
enough
to
them
or
about
them
but
if
she
takes
a
fancy
to
any
one
then
she
just
adores
her
and
i
m
so
glad
she
s
taken
a
fancy
to
you
she
surely
yes
she
has
but
sometimes
it
embarrasses
me
for
she
invites
me
to
see
her
so
often
or
to
go
to
entertainments
with
her
and
i
to
refuse
for
i
mustn
t
neglect
my
oh
she
understands
that
you
stand
by
your
work
and
i
know
her
well
enough
to
know
she
ll
respect
and
admire
you
all
the
more
for
chapter
iv
the
hundredth
question
it
was
the
very
last
day
of
march
the
next
day
patty
must
send
in
her
answers
to
the
hundred
puzzles
and
she
still
had
four
of
them
unsolved
she
had
worked
on
these
all
day
and
her
brain
was
weary
kenneth
came
in
late
in
the
afternoon
but
he
couldn
t
help
as
he
had
no
knack
for
puzzles
i
don
t
like
them
patty
he
declared
you
see
acrostics
have
cross
words
to
them
and
cross
words
always
irritate
me
i
like
kind
all
right
ken
said
patty
laughing
i
ll
invent
a
new
kind
of
acrostic
that
has
only
kind
words
in
it
some
day
but
can
t
you
help
me
with
this
one
a
train
of
six
cars
is
to
be
pulled
up
a
steep
incline
the
engine
provided
can
pull
only
three
cars
another
engine
of
equal
power
is
brought
and
put
behind
the
train
to
push
it
up
the
hill
the
two
engines
working
together
get
the
train
uphill
supposing
the
cars
coupled
with
chains
are
the
chains
taut
or
hanging
loosely
i
ve
puzzled
over
that
for
hours
you
see
half
the
weight
of
the
train
is
pulled
and
half
is
pushed
so
how
do
those
stupid
chains
know
whether
they
re
to
hang
loose
or
pull
taut
h
m
said
kenneth
there
must
be
an
answer
to
that
where
s
your
van
reypen
satellite
can
t
he
do
it
you
needn
t
speak
of
van
reypen
in
that
tone
said
patty
annoyed
he
s
helped
me
a
lot
more
than
you
have
there
there
patsy
don
t
be
an
acrostic
don
t
give
cross
words
to
your
poor
old
chum
who
lives
but
for
to
please
patty
laughed
at
kenneth
s
mock
tragic
tones
but
she
went
on
i
do
think
you
might
do
one
for
me
ken
you
haven
t
even
all
right
girlie
i
ll
do
this
one
about
the
cars
and
chains
do
you
mind
if
i
go
off
by
myself
to
think
it
out
kenneth
went
into
another
room
and
patty
looked
after
him
in
wonderment
she
didn
t
guess
that
he
was
longing
to
help
her
and
though
he
couldn
t
guess
conundrums
he
hoped
he
might
puzzle
out
this
question
of
mechanical
power
and
then
hepworth
came
and
also
philip
van
reypen
they
knew
it
was
the
last
day
and
they
wanted
to
hear
what
patty
s
final
report
might
be
philip
van
reypen
had
been
greatly
amused
at
the
letter
patty
wrote
him
and
being
an
exceedingly
sensible
young
man
he
had
not
answered
or
referred
to
it
definitely
but
had
accepted
its
dictum
and
had
called
at
the
fairfield
house
far
less
often
nor
had
he
again
hinted
for
an
invitation
to
dinner
but
awaited
one
which
should
be
freely
given
how
many
yet
to
do
he
asked
blithely
four
answered
patty
disconsolately
out
with
em
what
are
they
not
charades
i
hope
i
simply
do
there
s
one
charade
left
but
here
s
an
enigma
which
is
about
as
bad
oh
hepworth
can
t
guess
it
appealed
to
thus
hepworth
made
up
his
mind
to
help
if
he
possibly
could
and
both
he
and
van
reypen
listened
attentively
as
patty
read
i
am
intangible
yet
i
may
be
felt
seen
and
heard
i
exist
from
two
to
six
feet
above
the
ground
i
have
neither
shape
nor
substance
and
though
a
natural
production
i
am
neither
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
i
am
neither
male
nor
female
but
something
between
both
i
am
told
of
in
the
scriptures
in
history
in
song
and
in
story
i
am
sad
or
merry
loving
or
treacherous
i
am
given
or
bought
and
because
of
my
great
value
i
am
sometimes
stolen
i
am
used
by
men
who
swear
and
by
innocent
children
of
late
there
has
been
a
prejudice
against
me
but
i
shall
probably
be
in
vogue
as
long
as
the
world
shall
they
all
thought
and
pondered
nan
came
in
and
as
patty
read
it
slowly
over
again
even
she
tried
to
guess
it
but
they
could
not
at
last
philip
van
reypen
gave
a
whoop
of
triumph
and
exclaimed
i
have
it
miss
fairfield
i
ve
guessed
it
will
you
give
it
to
me
if
i
tell
you
what
it
is
your
speech
sounds
like
an
enigma
too
said
patty
a
little
bewildered
but
i
ve
guessed
it
i
tell
you
and
if
you
ll
promise
to
give
it
to
me
i
ll
tell
you
the
no
i
won
t
promise
said
patty
it
might
be
the
motor
car
itself
but
it
isn
t
it
s
far
more
valuable
than
that
it
s
a
kiss
oh
said
patty
so
it
is
how
you
guess
it
it
s
fearfully
hard
hepworth
looked
distinctly
chagrined
why
he
thought
couldn
t
he
have
guessed
the
foolish
thing
it
was
easy
enough
one
knew
it
ken
come
in
here
cried
patty
we
have
guessed
another
that
is
van
reypen
did
now
there
are
only
three
only
two
announced
kenneth
as
with
a
beaming
face
he
came
in
bringing
a
dozen
sheets
of
paper
scrawled
all
over
with
sketches
of
trains
of
cars
going
uphill
oh
have
you
done
that
one
yes
i
m
sure
i
m
right
the
three
first
cars
would
have
taut
chains
being
pulled
by
the
front
engine
and
the
three
last
cars
would
be
pushed
up
close
together
with
their
chains
hanging
limp
because
they
are
pushed
by
the
back
oh
ken
of
course
that
s
right
thank
you
heaps
now
i
ll
get
the
other
two
if
i
have
to
sit
up
all
night
to
do
it
what
are
they
asked
hepworth
conscious
of
a
faint
hope
that
he
might
yet
be
of
assistance
one
s
a
charade
answered
patty
here
it
is
tis
futile
son
my
first
to
use
to
change
to
yours
another
s
views
for
one
convinced
against
his
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
if
e
er
a
letter
you
receive
from
maiden
fair
pray
don
t
believe
all
that
the
note
itself
may
say
but
to
my
last
attention
pay
my
total
may
be
well
employed
to
still
a
molar
s
aching
void
when
stopping
has
not
stopped
the
pain
that
tooth
will
never
ache
again
i
ve
worked
on
that
a
solid
week
but
i
can
t
get
count
me
out
too
said
philip
van
reypen
charades
are
too
many
for
i
ll
do
that
one
for
you
patty
said
hepworth
quietly
give
me
a
copy
to
take
home
with
me
and
i
ll
send
you
the
answer
or
early
in
the
bless
you
my
angel
cried
patty
will
you
really
why
hepworth
i
didn
t
know
you
guess
i
can
t
said
he
a
little
grimly
but
i
m
going
to
all
the
same
for
and
with
a
expression
hepworth
took
leave
of
the
group
poor
man
said
nan
he
can
t
guess
it
he
just
wants
to
help
you
out
but
patty
smiled
and
shook
her
head
nay
nay
nan
she
said
if
hepworth
says
he
ll
guess
that
thing
he
will
it
s
as
good
as
done
what
faith
murmured
van
reypen
yes
indeed
declared
patty
why
if
i
lost
faith
in
hepworth
i
d
lose
faith
in
the
the
i
ve
known
him
for
years
and
he
fails
me
i
guessed
one
said
kenneth
proudly
you
did
returned
patty
smiling
on
him
and
just
for
that
i
m
going
to
take
you
a
whole
block
in
my
motor
car
oh
how
lovely
but
first
catch
your
now
what
s
the
only
one
left
asked
philip
who
wanted
to
distinguish
himself
again
oh
just
a
simple
conundrum
said
patty
what
is
lower
with
a
head
on
it
than
without
one
that
sounds
simple
but
it
isn
t
easy
said
philip
after
a
few
moments
thoughts
nails
heads
seems
to
be
the
right
and
try
as
they
would
they
couldn
t
think
of
anything
that
led
to
the
right
answer
the
boys
went
home
declaring
they
d
think
it
up
and
patty
mulled
it
over
in
her
mind
all
the
evening
without
result
then
she
went
to
bed
declaring
she
d
dream
of
the
answer
the
next
morning
she
overslept
and
nan
fearing
she
would
be
late
with
her
list
of
answers
went
to
waken
her
wake
up
you
little
april
fool
she
cried
gently
pulling
patty
s
gold
curls
oh
nan
is
it
morning
i
m
so
sleepy
but
you
must
wake
up
it
s
the
first
of
april
and
you
must
win
that
motor
car
or
never
patty
raised
her
head
and
then
dropped
it
back
on
the
pillow
i
can
t
get
my
head
up
she
said
it
s
too
heavy
i
guess
i
ll
give
up
the
motor
car
i
d
rather
keep
my
head
on
the
pillow
oh
nan
and
suddenly
patty
sprang
up
with
a
wild
yell
that
s
it
i
ve
got
it
hurrah
mercy
patty
do
keep
quiet
the
matter
why
that
s
it
the
last
puzzle
what
is
lower
with
a
head
on
it
than
without
one
answer
a
pillow
see
patty
you
re
crazy
i
suppose
that
is
the
answer
but
think
it
s
no
it
isn
t
not
as
puzzles
go
oh
nan
now
i
have
them
all
not
the
one
hepworth
took
he
ll
get
it
back
in
time
you
see
if
he
doesn
t
oh
nan
hooray
with
me
i
won
t
you
ve
made
noise
enough
to
frighten
the
whole
block
now
do
quiet
down
patty
and
get
all
right
i
will
said
patty
in
a
whisper
and
nan
went
away
laughing
patty
went
down
to
breakfast
in
a
very
happy
frame
of
mind
and
announced
to
her
father
that
the
motor
car
was
as
good
as
won
why
do
you
feel
so
sure
of
hepworth
s
puzzle
asked
her
father
a
little
curiously
he
never
solved
a
charade
it
doesn
t
matter
said
patty
with
supreme
confidence
he
said
he
d
do
it
if
he
hadn
t
he
could
do
it
he
wouldn
t
have
said
he
do
oh
stop
patty
cried
nan
you
talk
like
a
puzzle
yourself
don
t
get
the
habit
i
i
won
t
but
now
i
must
go
and
copy
my
answers
neatly
and
by
that
time
hepworth
s
will
be
here
and
i
ll
send
em
off
about
patty
spent
a
happy
morning
copying
her
answers
in
her
neat
script
and
looking
with
pride
at
her
complete
list
at
last
it
was
all
done
and
she
had
left
a
vacant
space
to
insert
the
answer
to
the
charade
when
hepworth
should
send
it
but
at
noon
it
had
not
arrived
and
she
had
had
no
word
from
him
telephone
and
ask
him
about
it
suggested
nan
as
they
sat
at
luncheon
no
said
patty
he
said
he
d
send
it
and
i
ll
wait
for
how
long
can
you
wait
why
the
only
stipulation
is
that
the
list
of
answers
shall
be
postmarked
not
later
than
april
first
but
i
hate
to
wait
till
the
last
so
should
i
do
telephone
no
not
yet
he
ll
send
the
afternoon
dragged
by
with
no
word
from
hepworth
at
four
o
clock
nan
went
to
patty
s
room
dearie
she
said
don
t
lose
your
whole
effort
by
a
bit
of
stubbornness
hepworth
must
have
forgotten
to
send
his
perhaps
he
sent
it
by
a
messenger
and
it
went
to
the
wrong
he
wouldn
t
do
that
said
patty
shaking
her
head
he
ll
guess
it
and
as
soon
as
he
does
he
ll
telephone
me
i
know
i
know
him
too
and
i
know
his
faithfulness
but
mistakes
do
happen
sometimes
if
you
d
only
telephone
let
no
nannie
said
patty
gently
this
is
my
picnic
and
i
shall
conduct
it
in
my
own
way
and
i
won
t
telephone
hepworth
if
i
have
to
send
the
answers
with
one
and
then
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
it
was
hepworth
calling
i
ve
guessed
it
he
said
breathlessly
but
triumphant
but
it
s
rather
complicated
and
i
can
t
explain
it
very
well
over
the
telephone
i
ll
come
right
over
is
there
time
yes
returned
patty
come
on
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
nan
with
an
i
told
you
so
expression
on
her
face
but
it
was
a
narrow
escape
said
nan
not
at
all
said
patty
then
hepworth
came
he
looked
calm
and
smiling
as
ever
and
showed
no
trace
of
his
sleepless
night
and
anxious
day
it
s
forceps
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
greeted
them
but
it
isn
t
a
fair
charade
at
all
a
charade
should
be
divided
into
its
two
or
more
legitimate
syllables
but
this
one
is
divided
force
and
you
see
the
is
referred
to
as
the
principal
part
of
a
lady
s
oh
that
old
joke
cried
nan
yes
but
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
old
joke
i
never
could
have
guessed
it
for
that
was
what
put
me
on
the
right
track
but
the
whole
charade
is
distinctly
unfair
in
its
i
think
so
too
said
patty
who
had
been
looking
it
over
oh
hepworth
how
did
you
ever
guess
it
i
told
you
i
would
he
answered
simply
yes
and
so
i
knew
you
would
she
returned
with
a
glance
as
straightforward
as
his
own
now
i
ll
add
it
to
my
list
she
went
on
and
then
we
ll
go
out
to
the
box
together
to
mail
in
a
moment
patty
was
ready
with
the
big
fat
envelope
clearly
addressed
and
much
bestamped
throwing
a
light
wrap
round
her
she
went
with
hepworth
the
to
the
but
the
large
envelope
would
not
go
in
the
box
never
mind
patty
he
said
i
ll
take
it
to
the
for
you
that
will
be
better
anyway
as
it
may
be
postmarked
a
little
sooner
and
it
s
my
fault
that
it
s
delayed
so
late
it
is
not
exclaimed
patty
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
i
couldn
t
have
sent
the
list
at
all
i
mean
not
a
complete
van
reypen
helped
you
far
more
than
i
did
said
hepworth
a
little
bitterly
patty
noticed
his
tone
and
with
her
ready
tact
she
ignored
it
mr
van
reypen
did
help
me
she
said
but
with
all
his
help
the
list
would
not
have
been
perfect
but
for
you
i
thank
you
very
patty
held
out
her
hand
and
hepworth
took
it
slowly
almost
reverently
patty
he
said
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
much
i
would
do
for
you
how
much
said
patty
not
really
thinking
of
what
she
was
saying
for
her
mind
was
still
on
her
puzzles
shall
i
tell
you
and
the
intense
note
in
his
voice
brought
her
back
to
a
realising
sense
of
the
situation
not
now
she
cried
gaily
you
promised
to
get
those
answers
to
the
in
time
that
would
be
the
nicest
thing
you
could
do
for
then
i
ll
do
it
you
little
witch
and
with
a
quick
bow
hepworth
turned
and
strode
down
the
street
chapter
v
a
summer
home
if
i
were
sure
patty
would
get
her
motor
car
said
nan
i
d
vote
for
the
seashore
but
if
she
doesn
t
i
d
rather
go
to
the
course
i
ll
get
it
declared
patty
i
m
sure
certain
positive
convinced
satisfied
beyond
all
shadow
of
doubt
that
i
ve
cinched
that
car
it
only
remains
to
get
the
formal
and
to
get
the
car
added
her
father
they
were
discussing
in
family
conclave
their
plans
for
the
coming
summer
patty
liked
the
seashore
and
nan
the
mountains
but
each
wanted
the
other
to
be
pleased
so
there
was
a
generous
rivalry
going
on
but
i
can
use
it
in
the
mountains
went
on
patty
mountain
roads
are
pretty
much
civilised
nowadays
and
anyway
it
s
sure
to
be
a
perfect
oh
to
be
said
fairfield
who
never
could
bring
himself
to
believe
seriously
that
patty
would
get
the
car
well
let
s
divide
the
time
suggested
nan
let
s
go
to
the
seashore
first
and
spend
say
may
june
and
july
then
go
to
the
mountains
for
august
and
that
would
be
lovely
declared
patty
enthusiastically
if
i
didn
t
know
you
were
planning
it
that
way
for
my
benefit
and
i
can
i
bring
myself
to
accept
such
a
you
can
t
help
yourself
you
mean
said
nan
and
now
that
part
of
it
s
settled
where
shall
we
go
i
like
the
new
jersey
shore
said
fairfield
because
i
can
run
up
to
new
york
so
easily
from
there
but
i
was
thinking
of
buying
a
house
so
we
could
go
to
it
each
summer
and
so
do
away
with
this
yearly
discussion
of
where
to
go
even
if
we
have
a
summer
home
we
can
go
on
a
trip
to
the
mountains
as
well
later
in
the
that
s
so
agreed
nan
no
one
wants
to
go
to
the
mountains
before
oh
won
t
it
be
gay
cried
patty
a
home
of
our
own
at
the
seashore
with
little
white
curtains
blowing
out
of
its
windows
and
box
trees
at
the
entrance
to
the
drive
that
sounds
attractive
agreed
nan
and
wide
verandas
all
round
and
the
ocean
dashing
over
them
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
investment
said
fairfield
we
wouldn
t
build
you
know
but
buy
a
house
and
then
fix
it
up
to
suit
ourselves
and
whenever
we
tired
of
it
we
could
sell
good
business
fairfield
said
patty
nodding
her
head
at
him
approvingly
now
i
know
the
spot
i
d
like
best
and
that
s
at
spring
beach
it
s
the
prettiest
part
of
the
whole
jersey
i
think
so
too
said
nan
it
s
not
a
large
enough
place
to
be
rackety
and
noisy
but
it
has
beautiful
homes
and
charming
people
i
ve
been
there
several
times
though
not
to
stay
be
sure
to
buy
a
house
with
a
garage
father
put
in
patty
for
i
must
have
a
place
to
keep
my
well
as
we
ll
have
our
own
car
there
i
fancy
we
ll
have
a
garage
puss
but
we
may
have
to
add
an
ell
to
accommodate
your
toy
wagon
when
do
you
expect
to
get
it
by
the
way
the
winner
will
be
announced
on
the
twentieth
of
april
and
the
car
delivered
about
may
first
so
i
ll
take
you
both
for
a
ride
not
both
at
once
of
you
ll
take
miller
on
your
first
few
rides
my
girl
until
you
ve
thoroughly
learned
how
to
manage
the
all
right
i
will
for
i
don
t
want
to
make
any
stupid
mistakes
through
ignorance
accidents
may
happen
but
if
so
i
expect
to
be
able
to
use
my
skill
and
knowledge
to
repair
patty
you
have
a
sublime
said
her
father
laughing
but
i
m
glad
of
it
for
it
will
probably
carry
you
through
when
your
vaunted
skill
and
knowledge
give
a
few
nights
later
fairfield
came
home
with
several
photographs
of
spring
beach
houses
that
were
for
sale
each
was
accompanied
with
a
description
and
the
fairfield
trio
looked
them
over
with
great
interest
two
seemed
more
desirable
than
the
rest
and
it
was
decided
that
next
day
they
should
all
go
down
to
the
shore
to
look
at
them
let
s
take
christine
suggested
patty
a
day
at
the
seashore
will
do
her
so
next
morning
the
quartette
started
for
spring
beach
christine
had
never
seen
the
ocean
before
and
patty
greatly
enjoyed
seeing
the
southern
girl
s
delight
it
was
a
fine
april
day
the
air
clear
and
cool
and
the
blue
sky
cloudless
save
for
some
masses
near
the
horizon
the
waves
were
deep
translucent
blue
with
brilliantly
white
crests
and
they
rolled
and
tumbled
in
to
shore
as
if
anxious
to
greet
christine
is
it
like
you
thought
it
would
be
asked
patty
as
christine
stood
with
clasped
hands
gazing
yes
in
its
lines
for
of
course
i
ve
seen
pictures
of
it
but
i
didn
t
know
it
was
so
yes
said
patty
with
a
nod
of
comprehension
that
s
the
way
it
seems
to
me
really
alive
and
always
responsive
to
my
moods
and
i
didn
t
know
you
had
moods
and
thoughts
said
christine
smiling
at
patty
a
little
quizzically
deed
i
have
perhaps
not
such
subtle
and
temperamental
ones
as
yours
or
hepworth
s
but
perfectly
good
moods
and
thoughts
all
the
why
do
you
class
mine
with
hepworth
s
because
you
re
both
artists
aren
t
artists
supposed
to
have
most
impressive
and
unspeakable
thoughts
at
sight
of
the
ocean
or
the
moon
or
the
purple
shadows
on
the
distant
hills
patty
i
suppose
you
re
making
fun
of
me
but
i
don
t
mind
a
bit
and
of
one
thing
i
m
sure
whatever
your
thoughts
may
be
they
re
never
unspeakable
right
you
are
christine
i
m
glad
you
appreciate
my
talent
for
volubility
that
s
why
i
like
the
sea
i
can
talk
to
it
all
day
and
it
is
most
appreciative
but
it
never
talks
oh
it
talks
back
to
me
it
has
told
me
lots
of
things
that
s
because
you
re
an
artist
but
this
must
be
the
new
house
father
s
turning
in
here
oh
isn
t
it
lovely
it
was
a
most
beautiful
place
though
its
somewhat
dense
shrubbery
partly
hid
the
view
of
the
ocean
but
the
house
was
delightful
large
roomy
and
it
seemed
all
any
one
could
desire
for
a
summer
home
they
went
through
it
with
many
comments
and
then
went
on
a
block
farther
to
look
at
the
other
one
they
had
in
mind
this
was
equally
desirable
in
every
way
as
a
dwelling
but
the
large
grounds
had
very
few
trees
or
tall
shrubs
so
that
the
was
unobstructed
this
is
my
choose
declared
patty
sitting
down
on
the
steps
of
the
front
veranda
what
s
the
use
of
coming
to
the
seashore
and
living
in
a
forest
oh
my
fond
parents
do
decide
to
take
this
one
for
your
little
patty
s
sake
will
there
be
shade
enough
asked
fairfield
yes
indeed
declared
patty
if
not
we
can
go
inside
and
draw
the
curtains
but
i
do
love
a
house
where
you
can
see
out
and
i
think
this
is
the
finest
ocean
view
on
the
it
is
corroborated
the
agent
who
was
showing
them
the
house
and
the
sunrise
view
is
i
don
t
often
see
the
sun
rise
admitted
patty
laughing
but
perhaps
i
shall
down
here
for
i
m
going
to
sleep
out
of
in
your
motor
car
enquired
her
father
no
sir
i
m
going
to
have
a
veranda
bedroom
there
you
see
it
between
those
two
front
towers
i
ve
always
wanted
to
try
that
sort
of
a
fund
well
whatever
you
and
nan
decide
on
i
ll
agree
to
said
fairfield
who
lived
but
to
please
his
wife
and
daughter
so
after
some
further
serious
consideration
of
rooms
and
outlooks
nan
and
patty
agreed
that
the
second
house
they
had
visited
was
the
one
for
them
and
christine
commended
their
choice
it
s
rather
large
for
just
us
three
said
nan
but
patty
replied
never
mind
we
ll
have
lots
of
company
i
expect
to
have
house
parties
a
great
deal
of
the
time
we
ve
never
had
room
for
much
company
in
new
york
what
shall
we
name
the
place
sea
view
said
her
father
and
patty
laughed
yes
she
said
or
ocean
view
or
fair
view
or
beach
view
no
let
s
get
something
descriptive
and
unhackneyed
help
us
i
like
a
name
like
the
breakers
said
nan
it
s
so
how
about
the
pebbles
asked
christine
looking
at
the
pebbled
walks
that
led
through
the
lawn
that
s
just
right
said
patty
and
it
s
seashorey
too
we
ll
call
the
place
the
pebbles
shall
us
nan
yes
i
like
that
it
s
simple
and
yet
and
now
said
fairfield
let
us
go
over
to
the
hotel
for
luncheon
and
then
while
i
have
a
little
business
talk
with
the
agent
you
ladies
can
rave
over
the
sea
the
sea
the
open
what
good
times
you
do
have
don
t
you
patty
said
christine
as
they
strolled
along
the
board
walk
to
the
hotel
yes
christine
i
do
and
i
often
feel
as
if
i
didn
t
deserve
so
much
happiness
and
perhaps
it
s
wrong
for
me
to
have
so
much
when
many
other
girls
have
so
no
patty
that
isn
t
the
way
to
look
at
it
you
ought
to
be
glad
and
thankful
but
never
feel
any
doubt
about
its
being
all
right
myself
i
have
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
sometimes
my
heart
almost
bursts
with
gratitude
but
i
know
it
s
all
right
and
that
i
to
have
it
whatever
is
is
right
yes
i
s
pose
so
but
christine
what
do
you
mean
about
yourself
are
you
glad
you
have
to
earn
your
own
living
oh
that
s
merely
incidental
since
i
have
to
earn
my
own
living
i
m
glad
i
can
of
course
or
at
least
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
but
i
mean
i
m
so
glad
that
i
have
such
talent
as
i
have
and
such
a
love
of
my
life
work
and
such
dear
friends
and
such
a
happy
outlook
christine
you
re
a
darling
i
don
t
believe
many
people
know
how
fine
and
lovely
you
are
do
they
i
don
t
know
many
people
said
christine
smiling
but
those
i
do
know
don
t
all
share
your
views
elise
doesn
bother
elise
don
t
let
her
bother
you
why
think
of
her
at
all
christine
if
your
philosophy
of
happiness
is
any
good
it
ought
to
teach
you
to
cut
out
anything
unpleasant
and
if
elise
is
unpleasant
cut
her
no
girlie
not
that
if
elise
is
unpleasant
it
may
be
only
my
imagination
shall
try
to
make
her
become
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
task
said
patty
grinning
for
she
knew
elise
better
than
christine
did
and
while
she
liked
her
herself
she
felt
sure
her
two
friends
could
never
be
very
congenial
the
and
luncheon
proved
most
acceptable
to
appetites
sharpened
by
sea
air
and
during
its
course
enthusiastic
plans
were
made
for
improving
and
furnishing
the
christine
will
help
us
with
the
artistic
values
think
that
s
what
you
call
em
said
patty
nan
can
look
after
chairs
and
tables
and
such
prosaic
things
and
i
ll
sew
the
curtains
and
i
love
to
make
soft
silky
frilly
things
i
m
just
going
to
have
fun
with
this
what
s
my
part
in
this
universal
plan
asked
fairfield
oh
you
can
just
pay
the
bills
and
say
perfectly
lovely
my
dear
whenever
we
ask
you
how
you
like
anything
as
this
was
just
the
r√¥le
fairfield
had
laid
out
for
himself
he
acquiesced
graciously
and
then
luncheon
being
over
they
all
went
back
to
the
house
again
we
ll
have
to
come
down
several
times
said
nan
but
we
may
as
well
measure
for
some
of
the
hangings
and
rugs
so
fairfield
filled
many
pages
of
his
memorandum
book
with
notes
and
measurements
and
after
an
hour
or
so
they
all
felt
they
had
made
quite
a
beginning
on
the
furnishing
of
the
new
house
one
delightful
room
with
a
full
sea
view
patty
declared
was
christine
s
room
and
she
was
to
occupy
it
just
whenever
she
chose
and
she
was
to
select
its
furnishings
herself
the
girl
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
this
new
proof
of
loving
friendship
and
though
she
knew
she
should
take
but
few
vacation
days
from
her
work
that
summer
yet
she
willingly
consented
to
select
the
fittings
on
condition
that
it
be
used
as
a
guest
room
when
she
was
not
present
patty
s
own
rooms
were
delightful
a
bedroom
and
opening
on
a
balcony
gave
her
the
opportunity
for
sleeping
out
of
doors
that
she
so
much
desired
her
father
insisted
that
she
should
have
what
he
called
a
civilised
bedchamber
and
then
if
she
chose
to
play
gipsy
occasionally
she
might
do
so
so
she
and
christine
planned
all
her
furniture
and
decorations
and
made
notes
and
lists
and
before
they
knew
it
it
was
time
to
return
to
new
york
you
know
a
lot
about
house
decoration
christine
don
t
you
said
patty
as
they
sat
in
the
train
no
not
a
lot
but
it
comes
natural
to
me
to
know
what
things
harmonise
in
a
household
of
course
i
ve
never
studied
it
s
a
science
now
you
know
but
if
i
didn
t
want
to
take
up
illustrating
seriously
i
would
try
oh
illustrating
is
lots
nicer
it
pays
better
i
don
t
know
about
that
but
hepworth
says
i
will
make
a
name
for
myself
as
an
illustrator
and
so
i
know
i
patty
laughed
you
have
as
much
faith
in
that
man
as
i
have
she
said
yes
i
ve
implicit
faith
in
his
judgment
and
in
his
technical
well
i
ve
faith
in
him
in
every
way
i
think
he
s
a
fine
you
ought
to
think
so
patty
why
he
worships
the
ground
you
walk
oh
christine
what
nonsense
patty
blushed
but
tried
to
laugh
it
off
why
he
s
old
enough
to
be
my
no
he
isn
t
he
s
s
a
lot
older
than
you
all
the
same
he
adores
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
talk
like
that
christine
said
patty
with
a
new
note
of
hauteur
in
her
voice
mr
hepworth
is
my
very
good
friend
and
i
look
up
to
him
in
every
way
but
there
is
no
affection
or
any
such
foolishness
between
not
on
your
side
perhaps
but
there
is
on
well
if
you
think
so
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
it
when
you
talk
like
that
it
just
goes
to
spoil
the
nice
pleasant
friendship
that
hepworth
and
i
have
had
for
it
isn
t
the
same
as
you
have
for
roger
farrington
and
kenneth
it
is
just
the
same
except
that
hepworth
is
so
much
older
that
i
never
call
him
by
his
first
name
the
others
were
my
school
chums
look
here
christine
we
re
going
to
be
very
good
friends
you
and
i
if
you
talk
to
me
like
that
about
hepworth
you
ll
queer
our
friendship
at
its
very
beginning
now
quit
it
you
yes
i
will
patty
and
i
didn
t
mean
any
harm
i
only
wanted
you
to
know
hepworth
s
attitude
toward
well
when
i
want
to
know
it
i
ll
discover
it
for
myself
or
let
him
tell
me
you
must
know
christine
that
i
m
not
bothering
about
such
things
i
don
t
want
affection
as
you
call
it
from
any
man
i
like
my
boy
friends
or
my
men
friends
but
there
s
no
sentiment
or
sentimentality
between
me
and
any
one
of
them
are
you
on
on
what
asked
christine
a
little
bewildered
at
patty
s
emphatic
speech
on
deck
said
patty
laughing
at
christine
s
blank
expression
and
changing
the
subject
with
promptness
and
dexterity
chapter
vi
the
award
patty
was
in
high
spirits
it
was
the
twentieth
of
april
and
it
was
almost
time
for
the
postman
to
call
on
his
afternoon
round
the
two
farringtons
and
kenneth
were
present
and
all
eagerly
awaited
the
expected
letter
telling
the
result
of
the
prize
contest
just
think
said
patty
how
many
anxious
hearts
all
over
this
broad
land
are
even
now
waiting
for
the
postman
and
every
one
is
to
be
disappointed
except
me
i
believe
you
enjoy
their
disappointment
said
elise
you
know
better
my
child
you
know
i
to
have
people
disappointed
but
in
this
case
only
one
can
win
i
m
glad
i
m
that
one
and
i
m
sorry
for
the
s
pose
you
don
t
win
observed
roger
what
will
you
do
there
s
no
use
s
posin
that
for
it
can
t
happen
declared
patty
turning
from
the
window
where
she
had
been
flattening
her
nose
against
the
glass
in
a
frantic
endeavour
to
catch
a
first
glimpse
of
the
belated
postman
but
just
for
fun
urged
kenneth
just
for
argument
s
sake
if
you
didn
t
get
that
prize
what
would
you
do
i
wouldn
t
do
anything
i
d
know
the
company
that
offered
it
was
a
fake
and
had
gone
back
on
its
own
patty
you
re
incorrigible
said
ken
i
give
you
up
you
re
the
most
cocksure
young
person
i
ever
thank
you
sir
for
them
kind
words
oh
sit
still
my
heart
i
hear
that
familiar
whistle
at
last
you
do
shouted
kenneth
making
a
spring
for
the
front
door
they
all
followed
but
kenneth
first
reached
it
and
fairly
grabbed
the
letters
from
the
astonished
returning
to
the
library
with
his
booty
he
ran
them
over
slowly
and
tantalisingly
one
for
fairfield
he
said
from
a
fashionable
tailor
do
you
suppose
it
s
a
dun
or
perhaps
merely
an
announcement
of
new
spring
furbelows
next
one
for
fairfield
unmistakably
a
circular
no
good
ha
another
for
fairfield
now
oh

begged
patty

pity
on
me

me

t

from
the
rhodes
and
geer
motor
company
why
yes
since
you
mention
it
i
notice
there
is
such
a
one
do
you
want
it
kenneth
held
it
high
above
patty
s
head
but
she
sprang
and
caught
it
and
waved
it
triumphantly
in
the
air
i
told
you
so
she
cried
but
you
haven
t
opened
it
yet
said
elise
maybe
it
only
tells
you
you
ve
hush
hush
little
one
said
patty
i
ll
show
it
to
you
in
a
accepting
the
kenneth
proffered
she
cut
open
the
envelope
and
read
the
few
lines
on
the
typewritten
sheet
enclosed
she
read
them
again
and
then
slowly
refolded
the
sheet
and
returned
it
to
its
envelope
after
all
she
said
calmly
it
is
well
to
be
of
a
philosophical
nature
in
a
time
of
oh
patty
you
didn
t
win
cried
kenneth
springing
to
her
side
and
grasping
her
hand
no
i
haven
t
won
said
patty
with
a
sigh
i
thought
you
were
terribly
positive
said
elise
not
very
kindly
i
was
sighed
patty
i
was
terribly
positive
i
am
still
what
are
you
talking
about
patty
said
roger
who
began
to
think
she
was
fooling
them
let
me
see
that
take
it
said
patty
holding
it
out
with
a
despairing
gesture
read
it
aloud
and
let
them
all
know
the
worst
so
roger
read
the
few
lines
which
were
to
the
effect
that
owing
to
the
unexpected
number
of
answers
received
the
decision
must
be
delayed
until
may
first
oh
patty
exclaimed
kenneth
greatly
relieved
how
you
scared
me
of
course
you
ll
get
it
of
course
i
shall
said
patty
serenely
but
i
hate
to
since
it
was
not
failure
after
all
the
young
people
felt
greatly
relieved
and
congratulated
patty
upon
her
narrow
escape
but
the
situation
is
too
dramatic
for
my
nerves
declared
kenneth
when
the
real
letter
comes
i
prefer
not
to
be
here
i
can
t
stand
such
harrowing
it
won
t
be
harrowing
when
the
real
letter
comes
said
patty
it
will
be
just
one
grand
triumphant
well
jubilees
are
said
kenneth
i
think
i
ll
stay
away
until
the
shouting
is
you
can
t
said
patty
saucily
you
ll
be
the
first
one
here
the
day
the
letter
is
oh
i
suppose
so
curiosity
has
always
been
my
besetting
sin
but
s
entertainment
seems
to
be
over
so
i
may
as
well
go
us
too
said
roger
come
on
so
were
said
and
patty
s
friends
went
laughing
away
then
patty
took
up
the
letter
and
read
it
again
ten
days
to
wait
she
said
to
herself
and
suppose
i
shouldn
t
get
it
after
all
but
i
will
know
i
will
something
inside
my
brain
makes
me
feel
sure
of
it
and
when
i
have
that
sort
of
sureness
it
never
goes
back
on
me
she
went
upstairs
singing
merrily
and
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
her
mind
as
to
her
success
in
the
contest
the
ten
days
passed
quickly
for
patty
was
so
absorbed
in
the
furnishings
for
the
new
summer
home
that
she
was
occupied
every
moment
from
morning
till
night
she
went
with
nan
to
all
sorts
of
fascinating
shops
where
they
selected
rugs
furniture
and
curtains
not
much
and
very
few
pictures
for
they
were
keeping
the
house
simple
in
tone
but
comfortable
and
cheerful
of
atmosphere
christine
gladly
gave
her
advice
when
needed
but
she
was
very
busy
with
her
work
and
they
interrupted
her
as
seldom
as
possible
patty
bought
lovely
things
for
her
own
rooms
of
blue
and
white
wicker
curtains
of
blue
silky
stuff
over
ruffled
dimity
ones
a
regulation
brass
bedstead
for
her
bedroom
but
a
couch
that
opened
into
a
bed
for
her
dormitory
by
day
this
could
be
a
couch
with
chintz
pillows
by
night
a
dainty
white
nest
of
downy
comfort
several
times
they
went
down
to
spring
beach
to
inspect
the
work
going
on
there
and
always
returned
with
satisfactory
reports
as
the
time
of
departure
drew
near
elise
began
to
realise
how
much
she
would
miss
patty
and
lamented
accordingly
i
think
you
might
have
arranged
to
go
where
we
re
going
she
said
you
know
you
could
make
your
people
go
wherever
you
wanted
but
you
go
to
the
adirondacks
elise
i
couldn
t
run
my
motor
car
much
up
oh
that
motor
car
even
if
you
do
get
it
patty
you
won
t
use
it
more
than
a
few
times
nobody
p
raps
not
but
somehow
it
just
seems
to
me
i
shall
it
just
to
me
so
but
elise
you
ll
come
down
to
visit
me
yes
for
a
few
days
but
you
ll
have
christine
there
most
of
the
time
i
i
ll
have
christine
whenever
she
ll
come
said
patty
a
little
sharply
and
elise
if
you
care
anything
for
my
friendship
i
wish
you
d
show
a
little
more
friendliness
toward
oh
yes
just
because
hepworth
thinks
she
s
a
prodigy
and
van
reypen
has
taken
her
up
socially
you
think
she
s
something
great
patty
looked
at
elise
a
moment
in
astonishment
at
this
outburst
and
then
she
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
i
think
you
re
something
great
elise
i
think
you
re
a
great
goose
what
kind
of
talk
are
you
talking
christine
is
a
dear
sweet
brave
girl
you
know
it
now
drop
it
and
never
never
never
talk
like
that
elise
was
a
little
ashamed
of
her
unjust
speech
and
only
too
glad
to
turn
it
off
by
joining
in
patty
s
laughter
so
she
only
said
oh
christine
s
all
right
and
dropped
the
subject
by
the
first
of
may
everything
was
ready
for
occupancy
at
the
the
lawn
and
grounds
were
in
fine
condition
and
the
house
in
perfect
order
but
patty
begged
that
they
shouldn
t
start
until
she
had
received
word
about
her
prize
car
why
puss
all
the
mail
will
be
forwarded
said
her
father
you
ll
get
your
precious
missive
there
just
as
well
as
i
know
that
daddy
dear
well
can
t
seem
to
feel
like
going
until
i
know
that
car
is
my
very
own
just
wait
until
the
third
of
may
can
t
you
she
was
so
persuasive
that
nan
went
over
to
her
side
and
then
of
course
fairfield
had
to
give
his
consent
to
wait
not
that
he
cared
particularly
but
he
was
a
little
afraid
that
patty
would
not
get
the
prize
and
thought
she
might
bear
her
disappointment
better
if
away
from
her
young
friends
but
they
waited
and
again
the
group
of
those
most
interested
gathered
in
the
fairfield
library
to
await
the
letter
christine
and
hepworth
were
there
too
this
time
also
philip
van
reypen
and
fairfield
though
outwardly
calm
and
even
gay
were
perhaps
the
most
anxious
of
all
for
they
knew
how
keenly
a
disappointment
would
affect
patty
the
whistle
sounded
the
postman
s
step
was
heard
instead
of
rushing
to
the
door
patty
felt
a
strange
inertia
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
go
ken
she
said
faintly
and
kenneth
went
silently
he
took
the
mail
from
the
carrier
silently
he
returned
with
it
to
the
library
there
was
none
of
the
gay
chaffing
they
had
had
before
and
all
because
patty
the
moving
spirit
was
grave
and
quiet
with
a
scared
drawn
look
on
her
sweet
face
hastily
running
over
the
letters
kenneth
laid
aside
all
but
one
and
slowly
extended
that
to
patty
she
took
it
opened
it
and
read
it
with
a
dazed
expression
the
eager
ones
circled
round
with
faces
tense
and
waiting
again
patty
read
her
letter
then
still
with
that
dazed
look
on
her
face
she
glanced
from
one
to
another
as
her
eyes
met
hepworth
s
she
suddenly
held
the
paper
out
to
him
i
ve
won
she
said
simply
and
gave
him
the
letter
then
she
drew
a
short
little
sigh
almost
a
sob
of
relief
and
then
the
colour
came
back
to
her
face
the
light
to
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
naturally
i
ve
won
she
cried
again
it
s
all
right
then
there
was
jubilation
indeed
everybody
congratulated
everybody
else
everybody
had
to
read
the
wonderful
letter
and
see
for
himself
that
the
prize
the
electric
runabout
had
indeed
been
awarded
to
miss
patricia
fairfield
for
the
best
and
most
complete
list
of
answers
to
the
puzzles
in
the
contest
only
the
girls
parents
and
gilbert
hepworth
knew
how
tightly
the
tension
of
patty
s
nerves
had
been
strained
but
they
had
been
alertly
watching
for
any
sign
of
collapse
and
were
thankful
and
relieved
that
the
danger
was
over
hepworth
didn
t
stop
then
to
wonder
why
patty
had
handed
him
the
letter
first
and
indeed
she
didn
t
know
herself
but
she
felt
his
sensitive
sympathy
so
keenly
and
saw
such
deep
anxiety
in
his
eyes
that
involuntarily
she
turned
to
him
in
her
moment
of
triumph
i
told
you
so
philip
van
reypen
was
shouting
i
knew
we
d
win
hepworth
old
man
you
did
it
with
that
last
charade
bully
for
you
yes
he
did
cried
patty
holding
out
her
hand
to
hepworth
with
a
smile
of
gratitude
but
you
all
helped
me
oh
isn
t
it
splendid
i
didn
t
so
much
care
for
the
car
but
i
wanted
to
oh
to
that
exclaimed
kenneth
she
didn
t
care
for
the
car
oh
patty
what
you
saying
give
me
the
car
then
oh
of
course
i
want
the
car
you
goose
but
i
mean
i
really
cared
more
for
the
winning
of
it
of
course
you
did
declared
van
reypen
that
s
the
true
sportsman
spirit
not
the
quarry
but
the
chase
i
m
proud
of
you
miss
fairfield
your
sentiments
are
the
right
patty
smiled
and
dimpled
quite
her
roguish
self
again
now
that
the
exciting
crisis
was
past
nan
she
cried
we
must
celebrate
will
you
invite
all
this
hilarious
populace
to
dinner
or
give
them
an
impromptu
right
now
dinner
cried
philip
van
reypen
and
dinner
took
up
the
other
voices
in
gay
insistence
very
well
said
nan
but
if
it
s
to
be
dinner
you
must
all
run
away
now
and
come
back
later
i
can
t
order
a
celebration
dinner
at
a
moment
s
all
right
we
and
obediently
the
guests
went
away
to
return
later
for
a
gala
dinner
and
a
real
celebration
it
was
fairfield
himself
went
out
to
the
florist
s
and
returned
with
a
centrepiece
for
the
table
consisting
of
a
wicker
automobile
filled
with
flowers
by
dint
of
much
telephoning
nan
provided
place
cards
and
favours
of
little
motor
cars
and
the
ices
were
shaped
like
tiny
automobiles
and
the
cakes
like
tires
and
all
the
viands
were
so
delicious
and
the
guests
so
gay
and
merry
that
the
feast
was
one
long
to
be
remembered
by
all
when
will
you
get
the
car
patty
asked
elise
i
don
t
know
exactly
in
a
fortnight
perhaps
but
we
ll
be
down
at
spring
beach
then
so
whoever
wants
a
ride
in
it
will
have
to
come
down

philip
van
reypen
and
i
will
come
down
there
may
i
ask
you
to
set
the
date
you
ll
get
a
notification
in
due
season
said
patty
smiling
at
the
eager
youth
i
m
not
sure
it
s
your
turn
first
no
elise
must
be
why
i
didn
t
help
you
at
all
said
elise
greatly
pleased
however
at
patty
s
remark
no
but
you
re
my
lady
friend
and
so
you
come
first
perhaps
your
brother
will
come
with
he
said
roger
with
emphasis
and
who
comes
next
asked
kenneth
with
great
interest
christine
of
course
said
patty
smiling
at
the
southern
girl
who
was
enjoying
all
the
fun
though
quiet
herself
just
as
i
guessed
said
kenneth
and
who
next
don
t
keep
me
in
suspense
owing
to
the
unexpected
number
of
applicants
decision
is
delayed
for
ten
days
said
patty
laughing
at
ken
s
disappointed
face
we
ll
let
you
know
when
you
re
due
ken
don
t
you
need
worry
asked
van
reypen
and
then
hepworth
said
need
i
no
you
needn
t
any
of
you
worry
but
i
m
not
going
to
take
anybody
riding
until
i
learn
how
to
manage
the
frisky
steed
but
i
can
show
you
said
philip
insinuatingly
so
can
i
said
roger
no
you
can
t
said
patty
miller
is
going
to
teach
me
and
then
then
we
ll
see
about
and
with
this
somewhat
unsatisfactory
invitation
to
the
pebbles
they
were
forced
to
be
content
after
dinner
kenneth
remarked
that
it
looked
like
a
shower
what
do
you
mean
asked
patty
it
s
a
still
clear
you
come
here
and
i
ll
show
you
said
kenneth
mysteriously
then
taking
patty
s
hand
he
led
her
to
a
large
davenport
sofa
and
seated
her
in
the
centre
of
it
now
he
said
let
it
shower
as
if
by
magic
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
parcels
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
fell
into
patty
s
lap
it
s
a
shower
for
you
explained
elise
dancing
about
in
glee
open
them
oh
i
see
said
patty
how
gorgeous
the
parcels
were
in
tissue
paper
and
patty
was
not
long
in
exposing
their
contents
one
and
all
they
were
gifts
selected
with
reference
to
her
new
motor
car
elise
gave
her
a
most
fetching
blue
silk
hood
with
quaint
shirring
and
and
wide
blue
ribbon
ties
christine
gave
her
a
lovely
of
the
newest
style
and
flimsiest
material
roger
gave
her
gauntleted
of
new
and
correct
make
kenneth
gave
a
of
the
most
approved
sort
and
philip
van
reypen
presented
a
clever
little
vanity
case
which
shut
up
into
small
compass
but
held
many
dainty
toilette
accessories
hepworth
s
gift
was
an
exquisite
flower
vase
of
gold
and
glass
to
be
attached
to
her
new
car
patty
was
more
than
surprised
she
was
almost
overcome
by
this
shower
of
gifts
and
she
exclaimed
you
are
the
people
and
you
needn
t
wait
for
invitations
come
down
to
the
pebbles
whenever
you
want
to
and
i
ll
take
you
all
riding
at
once
i
don
t
see
where
you
ever
found
such
beautiful
things
nor
you
gave
them
to
me
because
we
love
you
patty
dear
said
christine
so
softly
that
she
thought
no
one
heard
but
kenneth
heard
and
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
patty
and
said
yes
that
s
chapter
vii
a
neighbour
two
days
later
the
fairfields
went
down
to
spring
beach
the
intervening
day
was
a
busy
one
fairfield
went
with
patty
to
select
her
motor
car
for
some
details
of
equipment
and
upholstery
were
left
to
her
choice
as
the
car
had
been
built
especially
for
the
prize
contest
it
was
a
beautiful
specimen
of
the
finisher
s
art
it
was
a
stanhope
of
graceful
design
and
fine
lines
the
body
was
royal
blue
with
cushions
of
broadcloth
of
the
same
colour
patty
was
informed
she
could
have
any
other
colour
if
she
wished
but
she
said
the
blue
suited
her
best
there
was
a
top
which
could
be
put
up
or
down
at
will
wide
mudguards
and
a
full
equipment
of
all
necessary
paraphernalia
such
as
odometer
and
a
complete
set
of
tools
patty
had
carried
with
her
her
flower
vase
and
clock
and
the
man
in
charge
agreed
to
have
them
fastened
in
place
the
flower
vase
he
said
was
unusual
on
a
stanhope
but
when
patty
said
it
be
attached
somewhere
he
promised
to
have
it
done
the
steering
gear
was
a
bar
fitted
with
a
hand
grip
and
both
this
and
the
controller
were
exceedingly
simple
and
easily
operated
the
demonstrator
offered
to
give
patty
a
driving
lesson
then
and
there
but
fairfield
preferred
that
she
should
be
taught
by
himself
or
his
experienced
chauffeur
the
trusty
miller
of
course
the
men
in
charge
of
the
salesroom
where
the
car
was
on
exhibition
were
greatly
interested
in
seeing
patty
because
she
was
the
winner
of
the
contest
one
young
man
stepped
forward
with
a
camera
and
asked
the
privilege
of
taking
a
picture
of
patty
seated
in
her
own
car
but
this
fairfield
would
not
allow
and
after
making
the
necessary
arrangements
about
shipping
the
motor
to
spring
beach
he
took
patty
away
isn
t
it
fun
father
she
exclaimed
as
she
went
off
with
him
her
hands
full
of
descriptive
catalogues
and
circulars
telling
of
the
marvellous
superiority
of
the
rhodes
and
geer
cars
over
all
competitors
it
s
lots
more
interesting
than
if
you
had
just
bought
a
car
and
given
it
to
and
lots
less
expensive
too
said
fairfield
smiling
why
patty
girl
that
whole
affair
as
it
stands
is
worth
nearly
three
thousand
goodness
gracious
is
it
really
i
had
no
idea
they
were
so
expensive
why
your
big
car
didn
t
cost
much
more
than
that
did
it
but
you
see
this
stanhope
of
yours
is
a
special
car
in
every
way
and
all
its
fittings
and
accessories
are
of
the
most
and
extravagant
type
you
must
do
all
you
can
for
the
company
by
praising
it
to
your
friends
i
don
t
think
you
can
do
any
more
than
that
to
further
their
oh
i
don
t
feel
under
any
obligation
to
the
company
it
was
a
business
enterprise
on
their
part
they
offered
a
prize
and
i
won
it
now
we
re
quits
of
course
i
shall
praise
the
car
to
my
friends
but
only
because
it
s
such
a
beauty
and
not
because
i
feel
that
i
owe
anything
to
the
you
are
rather
a
logical
young
woman
after
all
patty
sometimes
you
seem
a
butterfly
and
then
again
you
appear
to
have
sound
a
butterfly
sounds
pretty
i
think
i
guess
i
ll
be
that
you
won
t
have
to
try
very
hard
remarked
her
father
but
sometimes
i
have
spells
of
being
very
serious
for
instance
wasn
t
i
serious
when
i
tried
so
hard
to
earn
fifteen
dollars
in
one
week
yes
serious
enough
but
it
was
largely
your
stubborn
determination
to
well
that
s
a
good
trait
to
have
then
it
s
what
hepworth
calls
steadfastness
of
yes
they
re
about
the
same
thing
and
i
m
glad
you
have
it
it
s
what
won
the
car
for
that
and
my
helpful
oh
the
helpful
friends
were
incidental
like
or
cyclop√¶dias
i
truly
congratulate
you
patty
girl
on
your
real
success
in
this
instance
but
i
also
ask
of
you
not
to
go
into
anything
of
such
a
public
nature
again
without
consulting
me
all
right
father
fairfield
i
and
then
they
were
at
home
again
and
the
luncheon
hour
was
enlivened
by
patty
s
descriptions
to
nan
of
her
wonderful
new
toy
are
you
going
to
give
it
a
name
patty
nan
asked
after
hearing
of
its
glories
yes
but
not
until
after
i
ve
used
it
i
can
t
tell
you
see
just
what
sort
of
a
name
it
needs
until
i
try
it
and
nan
let
s
do
a
little
shopping
this
afternoon
i
want
a
new
and
a
few
other
trifles
to
live
up
to
the
appearance
of
that
thing
of
the
shopping
was
done
some
marvellous
was
purchased
and
then
the
next
day
the
departure
from
new
york
was
made
they
reached
the
pebbles
in
and
the
ocean
and
sky
were
a
glowing
mass
of
blue
and
white
and
gold
nan
s
servants
had
the
house
open
and
ready
for
them
and
patty
flew
up
the
steps
and
into
the
great
hall
with
a
whoop
of
delight
isn
t
it
great
nan
isn
t
it
fine
more
fun
than
travelling
abroad
or
touristing
through
sunny
for
you
see
this
is
our
own
home
and
we
own
it
patty
your
enthusiasm
will
wear
you
out
some
day
do
take
it
more
can
t
do
it
i
m
of
a
nervous
temperament
and
exuberant
disposition
and
i
have
to
express
my
thinks
the
big
hall
was
in
reality
a
it
extended
straight
through
the
house
with
wide
doors
at
either
end
it
had
alcoves
with
cushioned
seats
a
huge
fireplace
windows
and
from
one
side
a
broad
staircase
curved
upward
with
a
landing
and
balcony
halfway
the
wicker
furniture
was
and
picturesque
besides
being
very
comfortable
and
inviting
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
a
few
things
flung
around
it
will
be
perfect
announced
patty
at
present
it
s
too
everlastingly
she
tossed
on
a
table
the
magazines
she
had
bought
on
the
train
and
flung
her
long
veil
over
a
chair
back
there
you
see
she
said
watch
that
veil
flutter
in
the
seabreeze
own
seabreeze
coming
in
at
our
own
front
door
and
then
tell
me
if
the
pebbles
is
a
success
yes
and
unless
you
shut
that
door
you
ll
have
a
most
successful
cold
in
your
head
observed
her
father
it
s
may
to
be
sure
but
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
very
thoroughly
may
as
so
patty
shut
the
door
and
then
opening
the
piano
she
sang
home
sweet
home
and
then
some
gayer
songs
to
express
her
enthusiasm
her
own
rooms
patty
concluded
were
the
gem
of
the
house
from
her
balcony
on
which
she
proposed
to
sleep
she
had
not
only
a
wide
view
of
the
sea
but
an
attractive
panorama
of
the
beautiful
estates
along
the
shore
a
hammock
was
slung
between
two
of
the
pillars
and
throwing
herself
into
this
with
an
indian
blanket
over
her
patty
swayed
gently
back
and
forth
and
indulged
in
daydreams
of
the
coming
summer
an
hour
later
nan
found
her
still
there
come
to
tea
patty
she
said
we
re
having
it
indoors
as
the
wind
is
yes
it
s
breezing
up
quite
some
and
patty
looked
out
at
the
waves
now
so
darkly
blue
as
to
be
almost
black
she
followed
nan
downstairs
to
the
hall
and
looked
approvingly
at
the
set
out
near
the
blazing
lovely
she
cried
i
believe
i
am
chilly
after
all
but
the
air
is
fine
buttered
muffins
oh
goody
father
the
table
bills
will
be
a
lot
bigger
down
here
than
in
the
i
daresay
but
i
won
t
begrudge
them
if
you
will
put
some
more
flesh
on
that
willowy
frame
of
yours
you
re
not
strong
patty
and
i
want
you
to
devote
this
summer
to
building
yourself
up
physically
no
study
not
much
reading
no
puzzle
contest
work
just
rest
and
exercise
moderately
and
spend
most
of
your
time
why
daddy
dear
your
plans
and
specifications
exactly
suit
me
how
strange
that
our
ideas
should
be
the
same
on
this
subject
you
see
with
my
new
stanhope
i
ll
be
all
day
and
as
i
propose
to
sleep
in
the
open
i
ll
be
all
night
can
i
do
more
i
m
not
sure
about
this
sleeping
outside
you
must
never
do
it
on
damp
or
foggy
now
father
the
sanitariums
advise
it
for
night
well
i
ll
agree
not
to
sleep
out
in
a
thunderstorm
for
i
m
scared
to
death
of
and
you
mustn
t
begin
it
yet
anyway
it
s
too
cold
wait
until
june
and
then
we
ll
see
about
all
right
i
ll
agree
to
that
why
somebody
s
coming
up
the
front
walk
nan
here
comes
our
first
caller
wow
she
s
a
dasher
in
a
few
moments
jane
the
new
parlour
maid
admitted
the
visitor
and
she
came
in
with
a
flutter
how
do
you
do
she
said
cordially
i
m
miss
galbraith
galbraith
your
neighbour
at
least
we
live
in
the
house
with
red
chimneys
two
blocks
down
but
there
s
no
house
between
how
do
you
do
miss
galbraith
said
nan
rising
to
greet
the
guest
and
followed
by
the
others
you
see
went
on
the
young
woman
volubly
after
she
had
accepted
the
seat
offered
by
fairfield
i
thought
i
d
just
run
right
in
informally
for
you
might
feel
a
bit
lonesome
or
homesick
this
first
day
so
many
people
no
said
patty
smiling
we
re
not
lonesome
or
homesick
but
it
was
nice
of
you
to
come
to
see
us
in
this
neighbourly
fashion
have
a
muffin
won
t
you
indeed
i
will
what
delicious
muffins
did
you
bring
your
servants
with
you
some
of
them
said
nan
we
re
simple
people
and
haven
t
a
large
well
we
have
said
miss
galbraith
and
i
m
at
the
head
of
the
whole
bunch
just
father
and
i
we
live
alone
you
know
will
you
come
to
see
us
come
to
dinner
soon
won
t
you
we
ll
see
about
it
said
nan
who
scarcely
knew
how
to
take
this
and
somewhat
forward
young
person
miss
galbraith
wore
a
costume
of
embroidered
white
linen
but
the
embroidery
was
too
elaborate
and
the
style
of
the
gown
rather
extreme
she
wore
a
long
gold
chain
with
what
patty
afterward
called
half
a
peck
of
junk
dangling
from
it
there
were
a
lorgnette
a
purse
a
cardcase
a
pencil
a
vinaigrette
a
and
several
other
trifles
all
attached
to
the
chain
and
miss
galbraith
played
with
the
trinkets
incessantly
i
hope
we
ll
be
real
good
friends
she
said
earnestly
to
patty
i
want
an
intimate
friend
awfully
and
i
like
your
as
patty
couldn
t
honestly
return
the
compliment
she
said
nothing
in
reply
miss
galbraith
s
personal
appearance
was
comely
and
yet
it
was
not
of
the
type
with
which
patty
was
accustomed
to
be
friendly
her
sandy
hair
was
too
much
curled
and
puffed
piled
too
high
on
her
head
and
held
with
too
many
jewelled
pins
while
her
rather
large
hands
showed
too
many
rings
for
a
young
girl
her
white
shoes
were
too
tight
for
her
and
her
easy
attitudes
and
frank
speech
were
too
informal
for
a
first
call
on
strangers
of
course
we
shall
be
friends
said
nan
with
just
enough
absence
of
enthusiasm
in
her
tones
to
convey
to
a
sensitive
mind
her
reservations
but
miss
galbraith
hadn
t
a
sensitive
mind
dear
fairfield
she
said
effusively
how
good
you
are
i
see
you
have
the
neighbourly
instinct
isn
t
it
nice
that
we
ll
all
be
down
here
together
for
the
whole
summer
do
you
swim
miss
fairfield
and
do
you
love
to
dance
yes
began
patty
as
she
hesitated
fairfield
came
to
his
daughter
s
rescue
to
be
frank
miss
galbraith
he
said
i
am
trying
to
keep
my
daughter
rather
quiet
this
summer
i
want
her
to
exercise
only
moderately
and
i
must
positively
forbid
much
dancing
and
late
hours
and
all
that
sort
of
oh
that
s
all
right
returned
the
visitor
nobody
keeps
very
late
hours
at
spring
beach
well
i
must
run
away
now
i
give
you
fair
warning
if
you
don
t
come
and
return
my
call
soon
i
ll
come
straight
over
here
and
return
it
myself
she
shook
a
playful
finger
at
patty
and
after
voluble
she
went
away
tripping
down
the
walk
with
the
satisfied
air
of
one
who
has
accomplished
her
object
well
said
patty
with
an
air
of
utter
exasperation
exclaimed
nan
fairfield
smiled
grimly
it
s
our
own
fault
he
said
we
should
have
enquired
as
to
the
character
of
the
neighbours
before
we
bought
the
how
soon
can
you
sell
it
father
asked
patty
one
more
visitation
like
that
would
give
me
nervous
prostration
mona
mona
indeed
i
never
saw
a
mona
before
but
i
might
have
known
they
were
like
but
can
t
you
really
stay
here
asked
fairfield
in
alarm
nonsense
daddy
of
course
we
can
do
you
think
i
d
let
myself
be
dispossessed
by
a
mere
mona
no
sir
nan
and
i
can
manage
i
don
t
quite
see
how
said
nan
thoughtfully
she
s
that
impossible
sort
oblivious
to
manner
impervious
to
hints
patty
she
s
dreadful
of
course
she
is
sweet
nancy
she
isn
t
our
sort
but
i
ll
attend
to
her
i
don
t
know
how
just
yet
but
i
ll
find
out
she
s
a
problem
to
be
coped
with
a
difficulty
to
be
overcome
but
did
you
ever
see
such
a
gown
there
was
just
enough
embroidery
on
it
for
three
frocks
and
her
hair
looked
like
the
wax
ladies
coiffures
in
the
windows
don
t
make
rude
personal
remarks
patty
oh
father
as
if
one
could
be
rude
to
an
object
like
that
well
people
dear
let
s
put
her
out
of
our
minds
and
hearts
for
the
rest
of
anyway
i
won
t
have
the
birthday
of
the
pebbles
spoiled
by
a
slight
incident
like
that
forget
it
and
so
the
impossible
miss
galbraith
was
voluntarily
ignored
chapter
viii
swift
camilla
at
last
the
car
came
patty
was
in
a
flutter
of
joyous
expectation
and
as
miller
came
whirring
up
the
drive
in
it
the
whole
family
assembled
on
the
veranda
to
admire
it
isn
t
it
a
beauty
nan
oh
isn
t
it
patty
exclaimed
as
the
sunlight
flashed
gold
sparkles
on
the
shining
paint
it
is
indeed
patty
i
never
saw
such
a
pretty
one
are
you
sure
you
can
run
it
oh
yes
i
know
how
already
you
just
stick
in
a
key
and
turn
it
and
grab
the
and
take
hold
of
the
steering
bar
and
push
and
pull
whenever
you
think
you
ought
not
very
technical
language
said
fairfield
smiling
but
i
think
you
understand
the
operation
jump
in
puss
i
m
going
with
you
for
your
first
but
though
fairfield
was
an
interested
spectator
patty
manipulated
the
car
all
by
herself
and
seemed
to
know
intuitively
a
great
many
of
the
minor
details
there
s
only
one
trouble
dad
she
said
as
they
went
spinning
along
the
smooth
hard
road
i
can
t
take
you
and
nan
with
me
both
at
never
mind
girlie
when
we
feel
as
sociable
as
that
we
ll
go
in
the
big
car
now
patty
let
me
see
you
change
the
then
followed
a
careful
lesson
in
speed
changing
stopping
suddenly
turning
going
backward
and
all
the
various
emergencies
that
occur
in
driving
you
certainly
are
a
born
motorist
patty
said
her
father
at
last
you
are
unusually
clever
and
about
knowing
what
to
do
and
doing
it
swiftly
and
cleanly
hesitation
in
motoring
often
means
it
s
because
i
love
it
father
i
d
rather
motor
than
go
driving
or
boating
or
even
flying
aren
t
you
glad
i
don
t
want
an
a√´roplane
daddy
you
wouldn
t
get
it
if
you
did
not
even
if
you
earned
it
yourself
as
you
did
this
car
now
patty
turn
around
and
let
s
go
skilfully
patty
turned
around
and
they
sped
on
their
homeward
way
some
things
you
must
promise
me
patty
said
her
father
seriously
as
they
drew
near
the
house
never
start
out
without
knowing
pretty
definitely
how
long
it
will
take
you
and
when
you
ll
return
never
go
without
being
sure
you
have
enough
current
for
the
trip
of
course
miller
will
look
after
this
for
you
but
i
want
you
to
understand
it
thoroughly
yes
i
want
to
learn
all
about
the
working
parts
and
how
to
repair
them
if
that
will
come
later
learn
to
run
it
perfectly
first
and
too
i
want
you
to
promise
never
to
start
anywhere
so
late
that
there
s
even
a
possibility
of
your
being
out
after
dark
i
wouldn
t
let
you
go
out
alone
or
with
a
girl
friend
in
the
city
but
down
here
you
may
do
so
if
you
never
travel
except
by
daylight
you
understand
patty
yes
father
and
i
promise
as
you
know
i
only
want
to
go
on
little
short
drives
two
or
three
hours
very
well
i
trust
you
not
to
do
anything
of
which
i
would
disapprove
you
re
a
good
girl
patty
at
least
you
mean
to
be
but
sometimes
your
enthusiasms
and
inclinations
run
away
with
you
and
you
have
no
sense
of
h
m
said
patty
smiling
now
i
ve
been
lectured
enough
for
one
lesson
father
dear
save
the
rest
for
another
day
and
watch
me
whiz
up
this
drive
to
the
house
like
an
she
did
so
and
nan
awaiting
them
exclaimed
with
pride
at
patty
s
skilful
driving
your
turn
now
nan
the
girl
called
out
then
mindful
of
her
promise
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
s
just
three
she
said
let
s
go
over
to
the
arbutus
inn
tea
room
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
get
back
home
before
six
how
s
that
father
that
s
all
right
my
good
little
girl
i
don
t
believe
you
ll
have
any
trouble
running
it
do
you
no
indeed
it
s
as
easy
as
pie
i
just
love
to
run
soon
nan
was
ready
and
the
two
started
off
in
great
glee
i
can
hardly
believe
you
really
have
the
car
patty
didn
t
you
learn
to
run
it
very
quickly
well
you
see
i
have
driven
cars
before
big
ones
i
mean
and
this
is
different
but
so
much
simpler
that
it
s
no
trouble
at
all
oh
nan
isn
t
the
scenery
gorgeous
gorgeous
wasn
t
at
all
the
right
word
but
a
tamer
one
would
not
have
suited
patty
s
mood
they
were
rolling
along
the
coast
on
one
side
the
ocean
on
the
other
an
panorama
of
seashore
settlements
with
their
hotels
and
cottages
interspersed
with
stretches
of
fine
woods
or
broad
level
vistas
with
distant
horizons
it
s
beautiful
patty
we
ll
have
a
lovely
time
this
yes
don
t
let
s
have
too
much
company
i
d
like
to
have
christine
down
for
a
few
weeks
and
of
course
elise
will
make
us
a
visit
but
i
don
t
want
that
horde
of
why
not
asked
nan
in
amazement
for
patty
greatly
enjoyed
the
boys
calls
in
new
york
oh
i
don
t
know
it
s
so
quiet
and
peaceful
just
with
us
and
if
they
come
they
ll
stir
up
picnics
and
dances
and
all
sorts
of
i
know
what
s
the
matter
with
you
patty
said
nan
laughing
you
ve
got
automobile
fever
you
just
want
to
ride
and
ride
in
this
pretty
car
of
yours
along
these
good
roads
and
just
give
yourself
up
to
indolent
enjoyment
of
that
s
just
it
how
did
you
know
nan
oh
everybody
feels
that
way
when
they
first
own
a
car
i
ve
often
noticed
it
sometimes
they
want
to
ride
entirely
alone
and
just
revel
in
gracious
nan
what
a
word
well
i
might
want
to
go
all
alone
once
in
a
while
but
usually
i
want
some
one
to
rave
about
it
all
with
well
i
m
ready
to
rave
at
any
time
isn
t
that
the
inn
off
there
to
the
right
yes
so
it
is
how
quickly
we
ve
come
nan
there
s
a
line
of
poetry
in
my
mind
and
i
can
t
think
of
oh
what
a
catastrophe
is
it
the
only
line
you
know
don
t
be
silly
but
truly
i
do
want
to
think
of
it
for
it
s
about
the
name
of
this
perhaps
a
cup
of
tea
will
quicken
your
perhaps
well
we
ll
try
jump
out
nan
here
we
by
a
clever
little
contrivance
patty
could
lock
her
car
and
so
feel
sure
it
would
not
be
tampered
with
in
a
country
place
like
this
somewhat
primitive
roadhouse
where
they
now
were
this
was
a
decided
satisfaction
the
tea
room
though
small
was
dainty
and
attractive
it
was
kept
by
two
spinsters
and
though
their
client√®le
was
not
large
they
sometimes
served
guests
at
several
tables
only
a
little
after
four
said
patty
looking
at
her
watch
we
can
stay
till
five
nan
and
then
get
home
by
all
right
returned
nan
who
was
walking
along
the
narrow
garden
paths
admiring
the
flowers
and
tiny
box
borders
patty
went
into
the
little
inn
ordered
tea
and
hot
waffles
and
cakes
and
then
returned
to
nan
it
s
a
dear
little
place
she
said
i
ve
heard
of
it
but
i
ve
never
been
here
before
tea
will
be
ready
in
twenty
when
served
the
little
repast
was
delightful
silver
and
china
made
it
all
seem
quaint
and
interesting
they
dawdled
over
their
tea
sometimes
chatting
sometimes
sitting
silent
it
was
a
bit
of
good
fortune
that
these
two
were
so
congenial
for
fate
having
thrown
them
together
they
were
much
in
each
other
s
company
as
there
was
but
six
years
difference
in
their
ages
their
relation
was
far
more
like
sisters
than
like
mother
and
daughter
and
though
nan
never
dictated
to
patty
she
taught
her
much
by
example
and
at
the
same
time
she
herself
learned
some
things
from
her
stepdaughter
s
pect
we
d
better
move
on
nannie
said
patty
at
last
as
it
was
nearly
five
i
ll
pay
the
reckoning
for
this
feast
and
then
we
ll
start
oh
it
has
just
come
to
me
what
has
that
line
of
poetry
that
i
couldn
t
think
of
this
is
it
when
swift
camilla
scours
the
well
what
of
it
why
it
s
the
name
for
my
car
swift
camilla
see
a
pretty
name
enough
but
is
she
swift
i
ll
speed
her
going
home
and
just
show
you
patty
don
t
you
dare
you
know
i
m
only
going
to
motor
with
you
if
you
go
with
great
all
right
i
won
t
scare
you
but
that
s
her
name
all
the
soon
the
swift
camilla
was
once
more
skimming
along
the
country
roads
patty
went
only
at
moderate
speed
for
she
had
no
wish
to
frighten
nan
and
too
she
had
promised
her
father
to
be
very
careful
they
were
about
halfway
home
when
patty
saw
a
cow
in
the
road
ahead
i
wish
that
old
cow
would
get
out
of
the
way
she
said
a
cow
has
no
business
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
road
like
she
slowed
down
and
the
car
crawled
along
behind
the
cow
but
the
indifferent
animal
paid
no
heed
to
the
motor
or
the
horn
and
ambled
along
in
mild
indifference
oh
get
out
of
the
way
cried
patty
exasperatedly
then
more
coaxingly
please
cow
nice
cow
do
get
out
of
the
this
brought
no
response
and
patty
grew
angry
again
shoo
cow
shoo
get
out
of
the
road
if
you
don
t
i
but
she
could
think
of
no
direful
deed
that
would
affect
the
cow
so
she
paused
then
she
resorted
to
sarcasm
a
nice
sort
of
cow
you
are
anyway
alone
and
unattended
on
a
country
road
why
anybody
might
kidnap
you
where
s
your
or
whatever
you
call
him
patty
don
t
be
silly
said
nan
choking
with
laughter
get
out
and
chase
the
cow
away
hit
her
with
a
stick
or
something
throw
a
little
stone
at
her
a
very
little
one
don
t
hurt
her
patty
s
eyes
grew
round
with
horror
why
nan
fairfield
i
m
more
afraid
of
that
cow
than
of
all
the
automobiles
in
the
world
i
m
afraid
of
cows
i
m
more
afraid
of
cows
than
of
except
a
mouse
but
a
mouse
wouldn
t
block
up
the
road
so
dreadfully
nan
you
get
out
and
chase
the
no
said
nan
shuddering
i
m
afraid
of
cows
too
patty
i
ll
tell
you
what
steer
the
cow
just
the
thing
i
believe
there
s
just
about
room
enough
if
she
ll
only
stay
in
the
middle
now
which
side
do
you
think
there
s
more
room
nan
on
the
right
go
round
her
on
the
there
was
plenty
of
room
and
patty
steered
carefully
out
toward
the
right
and
passed
the
cow
safely
enough
hurrah
she
cried
but
she
hurrahed
a
trifle
too
soon
as
she
directed
her
car
back
to
the
hard
road
she
discovered
that
she
had
sidetracked
into
a
very
sandy
place
the
front
wheels
of
her
car
were
all
right
but
the
hind
wheels
were
stuck
in
the
sand
but
a
little
the
other
deeply
put
on
more
speed
cried
nan
hurry
before
it
sinks
in
deeper
patty
put
on
more
speed
which
contrary
to
her
intent
made
the
hind
wheels
sink
lower
and
lower
in
the
soft
sand
the
car
had
stopped
and
no
effort
of
patty
s
could
start
it
she
looked
at
nan
with
a
comical
smile
adventure
no
she
said
oh
nan
we
can
t
get
home
by
six
indeed
i
don
t
see
how
we
can
ever
get
are
you
frightened
patty
no
there
s
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
but
i
hopping
mad
just
about
expresses
my
feelings
you
see
nan
it
s
like
a
quicksand
the
more
we
struggle
to
get
out
the
deeper
we
get
h
m
what
are
you
going
to
do
just
plain
nothing
my
lady
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
s
nothing
to
and
do
you
propose
to
sit
here
all
night
that
s
as
fate
wills
it
do
you
suppose
father
will
come
to
look
for
us
along
toward
midnight
patty
don
t
be
a
goose
fred
will
be
scared
to
death
because
i
m
a
goose
oh
no
he
knows
i
am
already
but
nan
i
ve
an
idea
if
i
were
only
strong
enough
if
you
were
could
lift
out
one
of
those
fence
rails
and
stick
it
in
the
sand
in
front
of
that
deepest
wheel
and
get
her
patty
how
clever
you
are
how
do
you
know
that
oh
i
know
it
well
enough
my
general
gumption
tells
me
it
but
re
neither
of
us
strong
enough
to
boost
it
out
of
the
fence
and
under
the
wheel
in
the
right
but
we
might
do
it
we
might
try
come
on
nan
let
s
make
the
effort
bother
that
old
cow
anyway
but
for
her
we
d
be
almost
home
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
with
plucky
effort
tried
to
dislodge
a
fence
rail
but
it
was
a
fairly
new
and
a
fence
and
the
rails
would
not
come
out
easily
they
tried
one
after
another
but
with
no
success
well
nan
here
s
my
only
solution
to
this
perplexing
situation
we
can
t
sit
here
and
let
father
lose
his
mind
worrying
about
it
and
thinking
we
re
ground
under
our
own
chariot
wheels
so
one
of
us
must
stay
here
with
the
car
and
the
other
walk
home
and
tell
him
about
walk
home
why
patty
it
must
be
five
miles
i
daresay
it
is
and
i
d
just
as
lieve
walk
it
but
i
hate
to
leave
you
here
alone
so
you
can
take
your
choice
and
i
ll
take
the
but
patty
that
s
absurd
why
not
let
one
of
us
walk
to
some
nearby
house
and
ask
for
help
capital
idea
but
where
s
the
nearby
house
there
s
none
in
no
but
there
must
be
one
nearer
than
yes
and
when
you
go
trailing
off
to
look
for
it
you
ll
get
lost
better
go
straight
home
and
leave
you
here
alone
i
won
t
do
it
then
there
seems
to
be
a
deadlock
oh
hey
hi
mister
i
say
nan
turned
frightened
at
patty
s
hullabaloo
to
see
a
man
just
disappearing
round
a
fork
in
the
road
he
had
not
seen
them
and
unless
patty
s
quick
eyes
had
spied
him
and
her
sudden
call
had
reached
his
ears
he
would
have
been
gone
in
a
moment
as
it
was
he
turned
stared
at
them
and
then
came
slowly
over
to
them
he
was
a
rough
but
not
fellow
probably
a
farm
labourer
and
apparently
a
foreigner
he
spoke
no
english
but
patty
made
him
understand
by
gestures
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
a
look
of
admiration
came
into
his
stolid
eyes
at
the
idea
of
patty
knowing
enough
to
use
the
fence
rail
and
his
powerful
strength
soon
removed
a
rail
and
placed
it
endwise
under
the
wheel
of
the
captive
car
another
was
placed
under
the
other
hind
wheel
and
after
much
endeavour
and
slipping
and
coaxing
the
car
was
once
again
freed
from
the
sand
and
stood
proudly
on
the
hard
road
patty
thanked
the
man
prettily
and
though
he
couldn
t
understand
a
word
he
understood
her
grateful
smiles
more
clearly
perhaps
he
understood
a
banknote
which
she
drew
from
her
purse
and
gave
him
and
with
a
grateful
if
uncouth
bow
of
his
awkward
head
he
trudged
away
patty
started
her
car
and
soon
at
a
good
rate
of
speed
they
were
flying
along
in
the
gathering
dusk
chapter
ix
mona
at
home
when
they
reached
home
it
was
really
after
dark
and
patty
was
prepared
for
an
expected
reproof
but
fairfield
came
out
smilingly
to
meet
them
accident
no
he
asked
what
was
it
power
gave
out
punctured
tire
or
misjudged
distance
none
of
those
cried
patty
gaily
but
it
was
a
real
accident
and
a
real
unavoidable
and
unforeseeable
one
oh
of
course
chaffed
her
father
accidents
are
always
unavoidable
and
never
the
fault
of
the
person
driving
i
m
glad
you
ve
learned
that
said
patty
saucily
for
if
you
have
that
theory
firmly
fixed
in
your
mind
you
have
learned
the
main
principle
of
motor
adventures
and
then
the
three
sat
down
on
the
veranda
and
patty
and
nan
detailed
the
whole
experience
to
fairfield
you
were
certainly
in
no
way
to
blame
patty
he
said
heartily
for
of
course
you
ve
had
no
experience
with
sand
and
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
wheels
would
sink
but
you
ve
learned
the
lesson
and
now
that
particular
trouble
is
not
likely
to
occur
again
for
you
will
remember
to
stick
to
the
hard
but
you
see
the
particular
trouble
was
really
the
cow
and
of
course
she
s
likely
to
occur
again
at
any
then
the
only
remedy
that
i
can
suggest
is
to
have
a
built
on
the
front
of
your
no
i
m
not
going
to
spoil
the
perfect
lines
of
my
beautiful
camilla
by
any
unsightly
device
you
see
father
the
lines
of
that
car
are
simply
perfect
i
know
this
because
it
says
so
in
the
booklet
the
company
gave
me
and
it
speaks
quite
highly
of
the
car
s
various
points
and
accessories
and
really
goes
so
far
as
to
state
that
it
is
superior
to
any
other
car
in
the
market
and
the
longer
i
use
it
the
more
fully
i
agree
with
the
i
m
glad
your
long
experience
justifies
the
company
s
claims
have
you
named
the
car
camilla
yes
because
she
scours
the
plain
don
t
you
remember
how
swift
camilla
scoured
the
plain
yes
i
remember
but
it
seems
a
more
appropriate
name
for
some
patent
cleaning
nonsense
daddy
have
you
no
poetry
or
romance
in
your
soul
swift
camilla
is
a
lovely
name
for
my
car
and
i
mean
to
scour
the
plain
for
miles
around
come
on
nan
let
s
go
and
tidy
up
for
dinner
it
s
getting
it
is
so
said
her
father
and
though
i
sha
n
t
be
too
severe
with
you
this
time
i
must
mildly
repeat
that
i
want
you
hereafter
to
get
home
from
your
scouring
expeditions
before
sure
cried
patty
gaily
blowing
him
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
as
she
ran
away
the
days
flew
by
and
as
the
weather
was
almost
always
fine
patty
went
scouring
with
camilla
every
day
sometimes
she
took
nan
sometimes
her
father
and
sometimes
she
went
all
alone
for
short
drives
up
and
down
the
coast
she
had
no
trouble
with
the
car
s
mechanism
for
it
was
really
of
superior
make
and
its
management
was
simple
but
one
afternoon
when
she
asked
nan
to
go
for
a
little
spin
nan
replied
i
will
later
patty
but
first
i
think
we
ought
to
go
and
call
on
miss
galbraith
it
is
more
than
a
week
since
she
was
here
and
in
common
courtesy
we
ought
to
return
her
but
i
don
t
like
her
and
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
see
her
declared
patty
a
little
petulantly
don
t
act
like
an
infant
your
not
liking
her
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
we
ve
had
other
calls
down
here
and
we
ve
returned
them
properly
now
this
is
a
social
duty
that
must
be
attended
to
so
come
oh
nan
you
go
without
me
make
excuses
for
me
can
t
you
no
i
can
t
and
i
won
t
so
go
and
put
on
a
pretty
frock
and
come
right
along
we
needn
t
stay
long
and
we
can
go
for
a
short
motor
ride
so
patty
went
away
to
dress
for
she
realised
that
she
must
go
however
unwillingly
she
put
on
a
pretty
calling
costume
of
white
serge
with
black
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
large
black
hat
you
look
lovely
said
nan
as
patty
joined
her
in
the
hall
yes
i
like
this
frock
said
patty
but
i
m
sure
miss
galbraith
won
t
you
know
her
taste
runs
to
more
elaborate
oh
well
you
can
t
expect
to
suit
everybody
come
nan
herself
was
in
cloth
with
hat
to
match
and
the
two
strolled
along
the
short
distance
to
red
chimneys
which
they
had
learned
was
the
name
of
the
galbraith
home
they
turned
in
at
the
entrance
gate
and
saw
a
large
and
massive
stone
house
with
many
red
chimneys
it
was
a
handsome
building
but
in
its
architecture
and
decoration
looks
exactly
like
mona
said
patty
as
they
drew
near
it
s
just
a
mass
of
heavy
embroidery
a
footman
answered
their
ring
and
taking
their
cards
on
his
silver
tray
ushered
them
into
a
and
departed
there
was
a
rather
long
interval
before
miss
galbraith
appeared
and
patty
fidgeted
the
golden
hours
of
her
afternoon
were
slipping
away
and
she
was
impatient
to
go
out
with
camilla
but
presently
mona
galbraith
came
downstairs
and
greeted
them
effusively
as
she
had
been
when
they
saw
her
before
she
was
overdressed
and
she
wore
a
house
dress
of
blue
satin
but
so
befrilled
and
bedecked
with
jabots
of
lace
that
it
was
not
only
unbeautiful
but
no
way
did
it
resemble
the
accepted
fashion
of
the
day
an
expensive
and
complicated
necklace
of
turquoises
surmounted
the
blue
satin
and
pins
of
the
same
blue
stone
adorned
the
masses
of
hair
patty
s
secret
impulse
was
one
of
regret
that
a
fairly
pretty
girl
could
make
such
a
dowdy
of
herself
and
she
resolved
if
ever
they
became
sufficiently
well
acquainted
she
would
try
to
tone
down
miss
galbraith
s
frantic
wardrobe
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
their
hostess
said
and
if
you
hadn
t
come
i
was
going
straight
over
to
your
house
to
tell
you
what
i
thought
of
you
oh
you
naughty
people
to
keep
me
waiting
so
long
why
didn
t
you
come
sooner
oh
there
s
been
much
to
do
said
nan
fitting
ourselves
into
our
new
home
and
too
i
think
we
re
fairly
prompt
returning
your
oh
we
mustn
t
make
calls
and
return
calls
that
s
too
formal
we
re
neighbours
you
know
and
we
must
just
run
in
and
out
without
ceremony
don
t
you
think
so
miss
fairfield
or
mayn
t
i
call
you
patty
please
let
patty
was
and
but
she
began
to
think
that
miss
galbraith
s
unwelcomed
familiarity
must
be
checked
isn
t
it
a
little
soon
for
first
names
miss
galbraith
she
asked
with
a
merry
smile
that
took
the
rudeness
from
her
question
i
like
to
win
my
friendships
by
degrees
and
not
jump
into
them
but
miss
galbraith
was
not
so
easily
baffled
oh
are
you
like
that
she
said
now
i
m
just
the
opposite
i
know
at
once
if
i
like
anybody
and
i
do
like
you
and
so
i
m
going
to
call
you
patty
of
course
if
you
re
so
cautious
about
making
friends
you
ll
have
to
adopt
me
more
slowly
but
i
ll
warrant
it
won
t
be
long
before
you
ll
call
me
mona
in
spite
of
yourself
and
you
too
fairfield
she
added
turning
to
nan
patty
gasped
for
she
almost
thought
the
forward
girl
was
going
to
call
nan
by
her
first
name
but
mona
did
not
go
quite
so
far
as
that
you
have
a
beautiful
home
here
said
nan
in
order
to
change
the
subject
have
you
lived
here
long
this
is
the
fourth
summer
said
mona
my
father
built
it
and
he
said
he
didn
t
care
what
it
cost
if
only
it
was
the
most
expensive
house
at
spring
i
fancy
he
achieved
his
desire
said
nan
politely
oh
yes
indeed
there
s
no
other
house
been
put
up
yet
that
cost
nearly
as
much
and
i
don
t
believe
there
will
probably
not
said
patty
but
it
seems
large
for
only
two
of
yes
but
we
have
a
great
many
servants
and
then
we
like
to
have
company
we
invite
a
great
deal
of
company
though
they
don
t
always
come
it
s
strange
how
few
people
enjoy
the
patty
privately
thought
that
there
might
be
other
reasons
for
the
guests
refusals
than
a
dislike
for
the
seashore
but
she
only
said
yes
i
like
to
have
company
too
but
i
m
never
lonely
even
if
i
m
entirely
yes
i
can
see
that
s
your
disposition
and
sweet
always
oh
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
to
spring
beach
i
ve
wanted
just
such
a
as
patty
said
afterward
she
felt
herself
being
drawn
into
a
net
from
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
escape
but
she
determined
to
make
one
more
effort
i
don
t
want
to
seem
ungrateful
she
said
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
m
not
very
then
like
a
flash
she
realised
that
this
was
not
true
and
endeavoured
to
amend
it
i
mean
she
went
on
in
the
summer
time
when
i
m
away
from
home
that
is
t
you
know
think
one
likes
a
sort
of
vacation
from
society
during
the
summer
don
t
you
oh
yes
but
of
course
the
social
doings
down
here
are
not
like
those
in
the
city
i
m
not
much
in
society
down
here
myself
so
we
can
have
real
good
times
with
each
other
and
give
society
the
patty
gave
up
in
despair
she
couldn
t
make
this
girl
understand
that
she
did
not
desire
her
intimate
friendship
without
being
positively
rude
and
though
of
an
independent
nature
patty
was
always
unwilling
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
others
but
very
soon
nan
rose
to
take
leave
and
the
call
was
over
what
can
i
do
exclaimed
patty
as
they
were
safely
out
of
hearing
distance
of
red
that
girl
is
the
limit
she
ll
be
over
to
our
house
all
the
time
if
i
don
t
do
something
to
stop
her
oh
don
t
take
it
too
seriously
advised
nan
sometimes
these
troubles
that
loom
up
so
darkly
fade
away
of
she
won
t
fade
away
declared
patty
mona
is
no
fader
but
some
day
i
shall
take
her
out
in
my
motor
car
way
way
out
beyond
civilisation
and
come
back
without
her
that
s
a
splendid
plan
said
nan
approvingly
practical
sensible
and
easily
carried
out
yes
isn
t
it
said
patty
grinning
and
then
they
were
at
the
pebbles
again
and
were
soon
arrayed
in
their
motor
toggery
and
starting
away
in
the
swift
camilla
which
way
asked
patty
as
she
grasped
the
steering
bar
straight
along
the
coast
answered
nan
the
ocean
is
so
beautiful
i
don
t
want
to
get
out
of
sight
of
all
right
here
we
go
and
patty
headed
the
car
south
along
the
line
continuous
shore
drive
nan
she
observed
as
they
flew
along
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
remarkable
important
and
day
that
is
going
to
occur
soon
day
repeated
nan
looking
blank
exceedingly
blank
that
it
seemed
an
assumed
expression
yes
day
day
day
day
do
try
to
think
it
may
occur
next
week
let
me
see
said
nan
in
a
deeply
thoughtful
tone
this
is
may
you
can
t
mean
washington
s
birthday
or
lincoln
s
no
nor
christmas
day
nor
patrick
s
day
in
the
morning
but
all
the
same
it
s
one
of
the
most
important
dates
in
the
annals
of
time
and
i
ll
give
you
one
more
chance
to
save
your
reputation
by
guessing
what
it
is
before
i
tell
well
of
course
i
have
no
idea
when
it
occurs
but
if
i
m
merely
guessing
i
ll
guess
that
you
refer
to
mona
galbraith
s
oh
nan
you
are
too
exasperating
another
speech
like
that
and
i
ll
put
you
out
of
this
car
and
let
you
walk
home
now
the
occasion
to
which
i
refer
and
which
you
know
well
enough
only
you
think
it
s
roguish
to
pretend
you
don
t
is
the
birthday
of
one
miss
patricia
fairfield
a
clever
and
charming
young
girl
who
will
on
that
day
achieve
the
dignity
of
being
nineteen
years
old
why
sure
enough
it
be
your
birthday
soon
won
t
it
exclaimed
nan
in
affected
surprise
which
by
no
means
deceived
patty
yes
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
well
you
ask
me
so
suddenly
i
scarce
know
what
to
say
what
do
you
want
done
well
you
ask
me
suddenly
too
but
i
know
exactly
what
to
say
i
want
a
celebration
of
the
oh
you
do
brass
band
and
parade
not
exactly
that
but
something
just
as
good
i
want
a
a
large
one
come
the
day
before
the
birthday
and
stay
several
days
after
and
celebrate
all
the
you
re
so
modest
in
your
demands
patty
why
don
t
you
have
something
really
worth
while
don
t
be
sarcastic
nan
you
re
too
pretty
to
say
such
things
now
take
a
deep
interest
in
my
plans
won
t
you
and
help
me
decide
things
all
right
patty
i
will
indeed
but
i
thought
you
didn
t
want
company
down
here
especially
the
boys
because
you
wanted
to
enjoy
your
scouring
the
plain
all
well
i
did
feel
that
way
for
a
time
but
i
m
getting
over
it
anyway
i
want
to
try
having
company
and
if
i
don
t
like
it
i
ll
try
solitude
again
now
you
see
nan
my
birthday
is
next
week
thursday
i
d
like
to
ask
the
people
to
come
wednesday
and
then
stay
over
the
all
right
patty
i
ll
do
all
i
can
to
make
it
pleasant
for
you
but
you
know
we
have
only
four
guest
rooms
how
big
did
you
mean
your
house
party
to
be
well
of
course
the
two
farringtons
and
christine
and
kenneth
would
be
about
all
we
could
accommodate
then
i
thought
if
hepworth
and
van
reypen
cared
to
come
they
could
stay
at
the
it
doesn
t
seem
very
hospitable
to
invite
them
that
way
said
nan
demurring
then
they
ll
have
to
stay
home
said
patty
cheerfully
for
as
you
say
we
have
only
the
four
rooms
to
give
them
i
thought
our
house
was
large
but
it
doesn
t
seem
so
when
you
begin
to
invite
well
we
ll
see
about
it
said
nan
chapter
x
the
courtesy
of
the
road
that
evening
they
discussed
the
project
with
fairfield
i
heartily
approve
of
the
plan
he
said
it
s
time
we
had
some
young
life
down
here
to
stir
patty
up
she
s
getting
too
sentimental
from
gazing
at
the
sea
and
sky
and
i
think
it
will
be
quite
all
right
to
invite
two
of
the
men
to
lodge
at
the
hotel
they
can
come
over
here
for
all
their
meals
and
so
they
will
practically
be
part
of
the
house
party
but
patty
are
you
sure
you
want
this
house
party
for
several
days
you
may
find
it
more
of
a
burden
than
you
think
to
entertain
guests
so
oh
they
re
not
formal
guests
it
s
just
a
young
people
s
frolic
we
ll
go
motoring
and
swimming
and
picnicking
just
as
we
like
but
of
course
on
my
birthday
i
shall
have
a
party
real
you
don
t
know
enough
people
down
here
to
make
an
evening
party
said
nan
oh
well
i
know
several
said
patty
and
if
we
have
eight
or
ten
in
the
house
and
get
eight
or
ten
more
from
among
the
spring
beach
cottagers
that
will
be
enough
for
a
small
and
there
s
mona
put
in
her
father
mischievously
oh
i
m
not
going
to
ask
why
patty
said
nan
you
ll
have
to
ask
her
very
next
neighbour
no
i
won
t
have
to
either
i
m
not
going
to
spoil
my
whole
birthday
just
because
she
happens
to
live
to
me
patty
said
her
father
i
think
you
must
be
a
little
more
generous
in
your
attitude
toward
that
girl
you
may
not
like
her
altogether
but
you
must
be
kind
and
polite
to
her
because
in
a
country
place
like
this
we
do
owe
a
certain
duty
to
our
neighbours
such
as
is
never
recognised
in
new
york
and
i
want
you
to
grow
up
an
unselfish
generous
woman
who
would
sacrifice
her
own
feelings
to
those
of
her
of
course
you
re
right
father
and
i
will
try
to
conquer
my
dislike
for
that
girl
but
you
know
what
she
yes
i
know
what
she
is
she
is
uncongenial
and
her
manner
irritates
you
but
there
must
be
some
good
in
her
patty
and
suppose
you
set
yourself
to
work
to
find
all
right
daddy
i
ll
go
you
but
won
t
you
please
let
me
wait
until
after
my
birthday
is
over
no
child
i
quite
agree
with
nan
that
you
must
invite
miss
mona
to
your
party
that
is
if
you
invite
other
cottagers
if
you
have
only
your
own
house
party
of
course
you
needn
t
ask
well
then
i
won
t
ever
ask
her
over
here
while
the
house
party
is
on
except
the
night
of
my
birthday
when
i
have
the
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
invite
her
said
nan
smiling
she
ll
very
likely
invite
well
we
ll
hope
she
won
t
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
now
i
ll
write
to
the
others
and
i
hope
they
can
all
come
i
think
they
all
will
unless
maybe
christine
will
think
she
can
not
leave
her
work
but
i
ll
urge
her
to
come
for
a
few
days
patty
went
off
to
the
library
to
write
her
notes
and
so
interested
did
she
become
in
her
party
and
her
plans
for
her
birthday
celebration
that
she
quite
forgot
her
unpleasant
and
unwelcome
neighbour
nor
did
she
think
of
her
again
until
the
next
afternoon
when
as
she
swung
in
a
hammock
on
the
front
veranda
she
saw
mona
galbraith
come
walking
up
the
drive
here
you
are
patty
called
out
the
hearty
and
irrepressible
voice
of
her
neighbour
i
hoped
i
d
find
you
at
home
i
felt
sort
of
lonely
and
i
said
to
myself
i
ll
just
run
over
to
patty
s
and
perhaps
if
i
ask
her
very
prettily
she
ll
give
me
a
ride
in
that
little
gem
of
a
motor
car
that
she
runs
so
patty
arose
from
the
hammock
politely
hiding
her
annoyance
at
mona
s
arrival
and
said
how
do
you
do
miss
galbraith
sit
down
won
t
you
i
m
not
sure
that
i
m
going
to
have
the
car
out
this
oh
that
s
all
right
never
mind
don
t
get
it
out
purposely
for
me
i
ll
sit
here
and
chat
this
afternoon
and
we
can
take
the
ride
so
patty
saw
at
once
that
she
must
either
take
her
visitor
motoring
that
afternoon
or
merely
defer
the
occasion
in
which
case
she
would
have
her
on
her
hands
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
anyway
of
the
two
evils
she
concluded
to
choose
the
less
and
she
also
concluded
that
as
her
father
had
requested
she
would
be
pleasant
to
this
girl
and
try
to
find
some
likable
qualities
in
her
so
it
was
with
a
shade
more
cordiality
that
she
said
oh
yes
we
can
just
as
well
go
this
afternoon
as
any
other
it
s
a
good
day
except
that
there
s
a
pretty
stiff
breeze
blowing
are
you
dressed
to
go
oh
yes
this
gown
is
all
right
and
you
can
lend
me
a
hood
and
cloak
or
something
haven
t
you
extra
ones
yes
of
course
said
patty
wondering
if
this
girl
had
no
idea
of
social
formalities
but
perhaps
she
never
had
anybody
to
teach
her
things
thought
patty
who
now
that
she
was
trying
to
be
toward
mona
found
it
easier
than
she
had
thought
patty
rang
for
miller
and
ordered
the
car
then
she
asked
mona
to
come
into
the
house
that
she
might
fit
her
out
with
proper
wraps
it
was
a
warm
pleasant
day
so
a
dust
cloak
of
nan
s
and
a
silk
hood
belonging
to
that
same
amiable
lady
were
borrowed
for
miss
galbraith
s
use
of
course
i
have
all
these
things
at
home
she
said
as
she
tied
the
ribbons
under
her
chin
and
patty
wanted
to
say
why
don
t
you
go
and
get
them
then
but
she
well
knew
it
was
because
of
mona
s
unwarranted
feeling
of
intimacy
in
the
fairfield
household
that
she
borrowed
their
wraps
instead
of
going
for
her
own
this
whole
principle
was
foreign
to
patty
s
nature
systematic
and
methodical
herself
she
always
used
her
own
belongings
and
never
would
have
dreamed
of
borrowing
those
of
another
unless
through
sheer
necessity
there
s
one
thing
she
thought
to
herself
if
i
give
her
this
ride
and
get
it
over
with
she
may
keep
away
while
those
other
people
are
here
i
must
be
careful
not
to
let
her
know
they
are
the
car
was
at
the
door
and
they
were
soon
started
patty
determined
to
be
kind
and
pleasant
to
her
guest
but
to
avoid
personalities
and
to
say
nothing
which
could
be
construed
as
an
invitation
to
further
acquaintance
one
point
she
conceded
however
and
concluded
to
call
miss
galbraith
by
her
first
name
this
she
did
only
because
mona
persisted
in
calling
her
patty
and
it
sounded
so
purposely
stilted
and
ungracious
to
persist
in
saying
miss
galbraith
patty
asked
her
guest
to
choose
the
road
they
should
take
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
mona
knew
of
a
great
many
lovely
drives
which
patty
had
not
yet
discovered
though
of
course
it
was
not
surprising
as
mona
had
spent
four
summers
at
spring
beach
and
it
was
patty
s
first
one
mona
chose
a
route
called
the
blue
lake
drive
which
took
them
through
a
lovely
stretch
of
pine
woods
and
out
into
an
country
the
goal
being
a
small
and
very
blue
lake
on
the
shore
was
a
tiny
tea
house
which
proved
a
pleasant
for
a
the
girls
sat
sipping
tea
and
eating
crumpets
and
patty
began
to
think
that
mona
was
not
nearly
as
unlikable
as
she
had
thought
her
shortcomings
were
more
those
of
an
impulsive
and
untrained
nature
than
any
more
serious
faults
she
was
well
educated
and
well
read
and
patty
found
that
they
had
many
favourite
books
and
authors
in
common
but
she
was
pushing
and
she
continually
asserted
her
intention
of
being
patty
s
intimate
friend
until
patty
lost
her
patience
and
broke
out
rather
sharply
look
here
mona
she
said
i
like
you
or
at
least
i
think
i
m
going
to
like
you
but
i
won
t
be
pushed
or
pulled
into
a
friendship
so
suddenly
you
don
t
know
me
at
all
but
once
in
a
while
i
have
a
way
of
speaking
my
mind
right
straight
out
and
i
tell
you
frankly
that
if
you
want
to
be
friends
with
me
you
ll
upset
the
whole
kettle
of
fish
by
rushing
it
too
hard
mona
looked
utterly
amazed
what
are
you
talking
about
she
said
do
you
call
me
pushing
i
do
that
declared
patty
just
exactly
that
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
i
shouldn
t
talk
to
anybody
like
this
on
such
short
acquaintance
but
you
brought
it
on
yourself
and
if
you
want
to
get
angry
you
may
angry
echoed
mona
why
i
like
you
all
the
better
for
such
straightforward
talk
i
m
sorry
i
seem
pushing
but
you
brought
it
on
yourself
patty
had
to
laugh
at
this
for
it
was
really
a
subtle
compliment
to
her
own
attractiveness
also
she
decided
she
could
do
little
by
scolding
mona
so
she
began
to
talk
of
other
things
leaving
the
question
of
friendship
to
be
settled
some
other
time
soon
they
started
homeward
again
for
as
patty
explained
to
her
guest
she
was
under
promise
to
get
home
before
dark
how
beautifully
your
car
runs
said
mona
as
they
skimmed
smoothly
along
do
you
never
have
an
accident
nothing
of
any
account
returned
patty
and
then
she
told
mona
of
the
day
when
her
wheels
got
stuck
in
the
sand
but
i
have
never
had
anything
more
serious
than
that
she
went
on
and
i
hope
i
never
shall
have
you
never
run
a
car
yourself
no
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
do
so
we
have
several
cars
of
course
and
lots
of
chauffeurs
and
grooms
but
only
since
i
ve
seen
you
in
your
car
have
i
thought
of
driving
one
myself
but
i
m
going
to
i
ve
already
asked
father
to
get
me
one
exactly
like
will
he
do
it
of
course
he
gets
me
anything
i
want
and
when
i
get
it
patty
we
can
go
out
together
in
our
two
cars
won
t
that
be
fun
h
m
h
m
murmured
patty
who
wasn
t
overjoyed
at
the
proposition
gracious
what
s
the
matter
oh
my
what
the
matter
did
something
burst
it
did
so
said
patty
cheerfully
the
inner
tube
of
this
front
wheel
has
burst
and
now
if
you
want
to
see
a
successful
imitation
of
a
young
lady
mending
her
own
motor
car
just
watch
me
while
i
get
out
my
little
kit
of
tools
and
put
my
reserve
tube
in
place
of
this
burst
can
you
do
it
yourself
enquired
mona
with
a
look
of
surprised
admiration
i
didn
t
know
a
girl
could
do
things
like
that
this
girl
can
returned
patty
opening
her
with
a
capable
air
but
the
next
moment
her
capable
air
completely
vanished
and
she
turned
to
mona
with
a
comical
expression
of
dismay
what
do
you
think
she
said
i
m
always
so
careful
to
have
my
car
and
my
tools
and
my
accessories
all
in
perfect
order
and
now
see
what
s
happened
i
had
this
same
experience
the
other
day
the
inner
tube
burst
and
i
put
in
my
reserve
tube
and
then
i
put
the
burst
tube
away
in
my
kit
and
here
it
is
yet
i
utterly
forgot
to
have
it
replaced
by
a
new
one
oh
then
the
reserve
tube
that
you
want
to
put
in
is
as
burst
as
that
one
you
have
just
taken
out
you
ve
struck
it
right
that
s
the
situation
now
what
s
the
solution
there
isn
t
any
answer
then
what
do
we
do
asked
mona
looking
scared
oh
we
just
sit
here
said
patty
returning
to
her
seat
in
the
runabout
it
isn
t
a
question
of
doing
anything
because
we
can
t
do
anything
we
can
sit
here
or
we
can
walk
home
or
rather
you
can
walk
home
if
you
want
to
i
sha
n
t
leave
my
car
if
i
sit
here
all
and
i
sha
n
t
leave
you
if
we
sit
here
all
night
but
if
i
can
walk
anywhere
and
get
assistance
for
you
i
ll
gladly
do
mona
you
re
a
good
deal
of
a
trump
said
patty
looking
into
the
girl
s
earnest
face
but
i
don
t
know
of
any
place
you
could
get
assistance
nearer
than
home
and
that
s
ten
miles
away
you
see
mona
when
motor
cars
do
break
down
they
invariably
choose
a
place
far
away
from
any
garage
or
repair
shop
the
farther
away
it
is
the
better
the
car
likes
it
can
t
you
hear
camilla
chuckling
at
our
discomfiture
how
can
you
joke
patty
i
think
it
s
awful
what
can
we
do
we
can
t
do
anything
but
if
we
re
patient
some
one
may
come
along
who
can
help
us
you
know
there
s
a
certain
courtesy
of
the
road
among
motorists
that
makes
them
help
each
other
whenever
they
can
at
least
this
courtesy
is
said
to
exist
but
i
ve
never
seen
much
of
it
myself
however
i
ve
had
very
few
occasions
to
desire
it
now
we
ll
sit
and
wait
for
nor
did
they
wait
long
very
soon
a
motor
came
by
and
the
polite
driver
of
it
stopped
and
asked
the
girls
if
he
could
be
of
any
assistance
patty
liked
his
quiet
courteous
manner
and
she
explained
her
difficulty
but
the
man
though
willing
was
unable
to
help
her
for
his
tires
were
not
the
same
size
as
those
on
patty
s
ear
he
would
have
been
glad
he
said
to
tow
her
car
but
he
was
going
in
the
other
direction
so
patty
thanked
him
for
his
interest
in
the
matter
and
he
went
on
his
way
now
you
see
observed
patty
that
there
a
courtesy
of
the
road
i
ve
no
doubt
some
more
courtesy
will
come
along
soon
and
we
ll
get
fixed
up
but
courtesy
seemed
to
be
scant
that
afternoon
for
half
a
dozen
cars
both
large
and
small
whizzed
past
them
apparently
without
noticing
their
plight
at
last
however
a
man
came
by
alone
in
a
small
electric
runabout
not
unlike
patty
s
own
hi
there
he
called
out
you
in
trouble
patty
did
not
like
his
mode
of
address
nor
did
she
like
the
looks
of
the
man
himself
and
even
though
she
greatly
desired
his
help
and
felt
sure
that
he
might
have
a
reserve
inner
tube
which
would
fit
her
tire
she
hesitated
to
ask
him
for
it
as
she
so
distrusted
and
disliked
his
general
appearance
he
looked
but
he
did
not
look
to
be
a
man
of
refinement
but
while
she
hesitated
mona
greatly
to
patty
s
surprise
took
the
situation
in
hand
and
called
back
to
the
man
yes
we
re
in
a
dreadful
fix
can
t
you
help
us
out
you
bet
i
can
cried
the
man
and
springing
from
his
own
car
he
came
over
to
patty
s
side
what
s
wrong
little
one
he
said
looking
boldly
into
patty
s
face
patty
was
thoroughly
annoyed
at
his
manner
but
now
that
things
had
gone
so
far
of
course
she
must
carry
it
through
sitting
up
very
straight
and
assuming
an
air
of
severe
dignity
she
said
the
inner
tube
of
a
front
wheel
has
burst
and
i
have
no
good
one
with
which
to
replace
it
if
you
have
one
you
could
spare
i
should
be
glad
to
have
it
and
i
will
send
you
a
duplicate
one
if
you
will
give
me
your
address
or
my
father
will
send
you
a
cheque
for
the
price
of
the
man
looked
at
patty
and
smiled
you
needn
t
be
so
crusty
about
it
he
said
the
other
young
miss
ain
t
so
patty
was
becoming
a
little
frightened
the
man
was
so
and
though
she
felt
sure
she
could
manage
all
right
by
herself
she
had
a
fear
that
mona
might
say
something
foolish
at
any
moment
i
don
t
mean
to
be
crusty
said
patty
smiling
pleasantly
but
without
friendliness
i
m
simply
asking
the
courtesy
of
the
road
from
a
and
i
feel
sure
if
you
can
you
will
give
it
to
the
man
backed
away
a
little
and
looked
at
patty
with
unmistakable
admiration
well
i
just
guess
i
will
he
replied
and
went
straight
to
his
own
for
implements
patty
took
this
opportunity
to
whisper
to
mona
don
t
you
say
another
word
to
him
you
mustn
t
speak
to
strangers
so
familiarly
you
came
near
making
serious
trouble
for
us
now
mona
was
of
such
a
peculiar
disposition
that
instead
of
realising
the
truth
of
patty
s
words
she
became
incensed
at
the
idea
of
being
scolded
and
made
no
reply
save
to
pout
her
lips
and
assume
a
very
angry
expression
of
countenance
the
man
returned
from
his
own
car
and
in
a
short
time
had
inserted
a
new
inner
tube
and
camilla
was
in
perfect
order
for
a
fresh
start
i
thank
you
very
much
said
patty
with
a
calm
gracious
politeness
and
if
you
ll
give
me
your
card
or
your
address
my
father
will
send
you
a
cheque
for
the
tire
and
a
note
of
thanks
for
your
kindness
to
his
taint
worth
mentioning
said
the
man
looking
a
little
sheepish
before
patty
s
courteous
dignity
and
i
haven
t
a
card
but
here
s
my
name
and
i
ll
be
glad
to
hear
from
your
father
he
scribbled
on
a
bit
of
paper
and
gave
the
address
to
patty
who
put
it
in
her
cardcase
and
bowing
civilly
to
the
man
she
started
her
car
and
drove
swiftly
away
chapter
xi
the
first
arrivals
mona
said
patty
severely
as
they
drove
along
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
talk
to
a
strange
man
in
that
familiar
way
he
wasn
t
a
nice
man
at
well
he
helped
us
out
of
our
yes
and
he
ll
be
paid
for
it
but
there
was
no
occasion
to
talk
to
him
as
you
would
to
an
oh
i
m
not
so
awful
as
all
that
it
isn
t
a
question
of
or
if
you
do
call
it
that
it
was
just
the
time
to
be
proper
civility
is
all
very
well
but
you
needn
t
be
chummy
with
a
stranger
and
i
give
you
fair
warning
mona
that
if
you
want
to
be
friends
with
me
you
must
never
do
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
want
to
be
friends
with
you
patty
and
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
now
but
i
didn
t
think
i
was
doing
any
harm
i
m
glad
to
have
you
scold
me
patty
for
i
do
want
to
do
what
s
right
you
see
i
never
had
much
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
since
then
father
has
indulged
me
in
everything
i
wanted
but
i
ve
really
had
none
of
what
you
may
call
social
patty
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
humility
of
the
girl
whom
she
had
considered
arrogant
and
she
began
to
think
that
she
might
do
a
good
work
in
teaching
mona
some
things
of
which
she
seemed
to
have
no
idea
but
which
came
to
patty
by
instinct
my
mother
died
when
i
was
very
little
too
she
said
but
i
think
my
father
brought
me
up
as
well
as
any
woman
could
have
done
and
then
i
have
the
dearest
stepmother
she
s
just
the
perfection
of
all
that
s
sweet
and
gentle
and
you
re
a
lucky
girl
patty
and
i
envy
now
that
s
silly
you
re
a
lucky
girl
to
have
such
an
indulgent
father
and
oceans
of
money
and
freedom
to
do
exactly
as
you
choose
why
you
have
all
sorts
of
possibilities
mona
you
could
make
yourself
anything
you
want
will
you
help
me
patty
why
yes
as
far
as
i
though
patty
felt
kindly
disposed
toward
the
girl
and
wanted
to
help
her
she
didn
t
care
to
take
the
entire
responsibility
of
shaping
her
future
and
she
knew
mona
s
pushing
spirit
would
demand
this
if
given
a
chance
so
she
dropped
the
subject
for
the
present
and
they
chatted
gaily
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
when
at
last
patty
set
mona
down
at
her
own
door
she
had
not
mentioned
the
subject
of
her
birthday
or
said
that
she
was
expecting
a
house
party
of
young
people
to
visit
her
on
reaching
her
own
home
patty
related
to
her
father
and
nan
the
experience
she
had
had
you
did
exactly
right
patty
girl
said
her
father
and
i
will
send
the
man
a
cheque
for
the
tube
and
a
letter
of
thanks
for
his
kindness
to
my
daughter
just
as
you
told
him
i
would
do
i
m
surprised
that
mona
should
have
acted
as
she
did
for
i
supposed
any
young
girl
of
the
present
day
would
know
better
than
to
speak
familiarly
to
a
it
wasn
t
so
much
what
she
said
father
as
her
gay
and
easy
manner
and
the
way
she
smiled
at
him
she
showed
no
reserve
or
yes
i
understand
and
i
am
glad
you
reproved
her
you
may
do
her
some
good
patty
by
your
influence
and
patty
sighed
a
little
i
m
willing
to
help
her
but
i
don
t
want
to
take
the
whole
burden
of
her
social
education
on
my
patty
laughed
nan
don
t
take
it
so
seriously
you
re
not
employed
as
nursery
governess
at
red
chimneys
yet
and
the
few
occasions
when
you
have
opportunity
to
drop
a
good
seed
on
mona
galbraith
s
thorny
soil
it
won
t
hurt
you
a
bit
to
do
hurray
for
nan
cried
patty
she
always
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
and
rings
the
bull
well
anyway
i
didn
t
tell
mona
about
my
birthday
or
that
i
expect
it
wasn
t
really
necessary
said
nan
drily
she
ll
probably
be
over
here
a
good
deal
of
the
time
not
if
i
see
her
first
retorted
patty
though
she
knew
in
her
heart
if
mona
chose
to
come
she
couldn
t
help
herself
well
said
her
father
now
that
we
ve
all
denounced
mona
sufficiently
i
ll
express
my
opinion
of
miss
patricia
fairfield
any
little
girl
who
pretends
to
keep
her
motor
accessories
in
order
and
then
blithely
rides
away
with
an
old
burst
tube
in
her
repair
kit
is
to
my
mind
as
i
ve
had
occasion
to
tell
her
before
a
butterfly
oh
don
t
call
me
such
dreadful
names
pleaded
patty
wringing
her
hands
in
mock
despair
do
let
me
down
more
easily
than
that
i
ve
never
done
such
a
thing
before
and
i
m
perfectly
certain
i
never
shall
again
i
don
t
believe
you
ever
will
returned
her
father
kindly
and
he
said
no
more
about
what
was
really
somewhat
culpable
carelessness
the
next
day
the
guests
arrived
it
was
wednesday
and
the
birthday
was
on
thursday
elise
and
roger
were
due
at
three
o
clock
hepworth
was
to
bring
christine
down
a
little
later
and
they
were
expected
at
five
while
kenneth
and
van
reypen
could
not
reach
spring
beach
until
seven
so
a
little
before
three
patty
started
in
her
car
to
go
to
the
station
to
meet
the
farringtons
as
elise
and
roger
stepped
off
the
train
they
saw
her
sitting
smiling
at
them
and
they
made
a
rush
for
the
stanhope
what
a
ducky
little
motor
cried
elise
oh
patty
it
s
the
prettiest
one
i
ever
saw
and
it
s
so
becoming
to
you
shall
i
get
in
yes
answered
patty
as
she
gaily
greeted
them
both
i
ll
take
you
over
to
the
house
elise
but
i
can
t
take
you
both
roger
if
you
don
t
mind
will
you
go
in
that
stage
vehicle
and
i
ll
give
you
a
ride
in
my
car
some
other
yes
of
course
patty
and
i
ll
look
after
the
luggage
you
two
girls
go
on
and
i
ll
see
you
later
where
do
i
go
to
patty
oh
just
tell
the
driver
to
take
you
to
fairfield
s
house
he
knows
where
it
is
we
call
it
the
pebbles
but
he
may
not
know
it
by
that
name
but
you
ll
get
there
oh
i
ll
get
there
declared
roger
and
with
laughing
the
two
girls
drove
away
don
t
you
love
your
car
patty
asked
elise
as
they
went
swiftly
along
yes
i
do
elise
i
love
it
almost
as
i
would
a
human
being
i
ve
never
told
any
one
this
because
it
seems
sort
of
silly
but
sometimes
when
i
m
out
alone
in
it
i
talk
to
it
just
as
i
would
to
a
person
and
she
seems
to
understand
i
ve
named
her
the
swift
camilla
and
somehow
camilla
seems
to
understand
everything
i
say
to
her
and
she
almost
talks
back
then
when
i
take
other
people
with
me
camilla
likes
or
dislikes
them
if
she
dislikes
them
she
shows
it
by
not
running
quite
so
smoothly
she
jumps
and
balks
and
shies
for
no
reason
at
all
except
petulance
isn
t
that
so
camilla
and
patty
patted
the
side
of
the
car
with
a
caressing
gesture
does
she
like
me
asked
elise
anxiously
yes
indeed
don
t
you
see
she
s
flying
along
like
a
bird
she
knows
you
understand
her
elise
and
you
don
t
think
she
s
merely
an
inanimate
inanimate
object
no
indeed
with
her
pulses
thrilling
and
her
sensitive
nature
alive
to
every
passing
incident
she
s
far
from
inanimate
patty
looked
at
elise
in
surprise
why
girlie
she
said
i
didn
t
know
you
had
so
much
imagination
in
your
i
ve
always
felt
that
way
about
motor
cars
patty
our
great
big
car
is
lumberly
and
fat
and
a
little
bit
stolid
of
disposition
but
father
has
a
little
runabout
that
s
the
nervousest
thing
you
ever
saw
but
this
stanhope
well
i
ve
simply
got
to
have
one
like
it
that
s
all
father
ll
give
it
to
me
in
a
minute
if
i
only
could
persuade
mother
to
let
me
run
it
alone
but
i
m
most
sure
she
never
this
car
of
mine
seems
to
sell
others
for
the
company
said
patty
laughing
there
s
a
girl
down
here
next
door
to
me
who
says
she
s
going
to
get
one
too
and
i
know
the
boys
will
all
fall
in
love
with
this
little
beauty
meaning
the
car
or
the
girl
next
door
asked
elise
smiling
oh
the
car
the
girl
next
door
isn
t
a
little
beauty
well
that
is
i
suppose
she
is
in
her
own
way
but
you
don
t
like
her
isn
t
that
it
and
elise
smiled
at
her
own
intuition
no
i
don
t
like
her
declared
patty
honestly
but
i
m
trying
to
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time
and
anyway
you
ll
probably
see
her
for
yourself
while
you
re
here
this
is
her
home
we
re
passing
gorgeous
place
said
elise
as
she
looked
at
the
imposing
red
but
i
like
this
next
place
better
this
big
white
house
is
good
for
you
elise
this
is
the
pebbles
and
your
own
patty
turned
into
the
drive
and
stopped
at
the
broad
steps
of
the
front
veranda
nan
was
there
to
welcome
them
and
the
two
girls
sprang
out
as
miller
appeared
to
take
the
car
away
roger
will
be
here
soon
exclaimed
patty
while
nan
greeted
elise
warmly
he
s
coming
over
in
the
stage
and
he
ll
bring
the
luggage
come
on
elise
i
ll
show
you
your
the
two
girls
went
off
and
patty
took
elise
to
one
of
the
pretty
guest
rooms
they
stayed
there
chatting
until
elise
s
trunk
came
and
then
patty
declared
she
must
run
down
and
entertain
roger
while
elise
unpacked
her
things
she
found
the
boy
still
on
the
front
veranda
talking
to
nan
with
whom
he
was
a
great
favourite
indeed
all
patty
s
boy
friends
were
favourites
with
nan
and
she
was
so
charming
and
attractive
herself
that
they
all
liked
to
chat
with
her
kenneth
harper
she
looked
upon
as
her
especial
prot√©g√©
for
he
was
alone
in
the
city
and
hepworth
of
course
was
one
of
her
old
friends
as
for
philip
van
reypen
nan
had
liked
him
from
the
first
and
they
had
established
a
very
chummy
acquaintance
so
on
the
whole
the
house
party
bade
fair
to
be
a
great
success
and
nan
expected
to
enjoy
its
fun
almost
as
much
as
patty
herself
you
re
getting
brown
patty
said
roger
looking
admiringly
at
the
tanned
face
yes
it
s
outdoorsiness
as
does
it
i
swim
and
walk
and
play
tennis
and
go
motoring
all
day
long
and
i
sleep
on
a
veranda
at
so
you
get
tanned
by
the
moon
as
well
as
by
the
sun
said
roger
well
it
s
very
becoming
and
you
look
a
whole
lot
healthier
than
you
did
in
the
yes
i
am
come
on
out
and
see
my
car
roger
and
i
ll
give
you
a
little
spin
if
you
like
elise
is
unpacking
her
finery
and
won
t
miss
like
every
one
else
roger
was
enthusiastic
in
his
praise
of
the
wonderful
car
and
gladly
accepted
patty
s
invitation
to
go
for
a
short
ride
he
complimented
patty
on
her
skilful
driving
and
they
went
for
some
distance
along
the
coast
road
let
me
drive
back
said
roger
as
they
turned
homeward
and
so
they
changed
seats
for
the
return
trip
beautiful
car
he
repeated
and
perfect
mechanism
patty
i
congratulate
you
on
winning
the
thing
and
it
s
wonderful
to
think
you
did
win
it
all
yourself
oh
i
had
a
lot
of
help
you
know
well
it
was
your
own
enterprise
and
you
worked
pretty
hard
yes
i
did
and
patty
smiled
at
the
recollection
i
sat
up
nights
with
those
hundred
questions
and
lots
of
times
i
thought
i
should
but
still
you
persevered
that
s
where
you
re
such
a
brick
patty
if
you
set
your
heart
on
anything
you
never
give
well
i
m
glad
i
persevered
this
time
anyway
for
this
car
is
a
perfect
joy
to
me
i
suppose
father
would
have
given
me
one
if
i
had
asked
for
it
but
somehow
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
wanted
one
i
had
no
idea
i
d
love
it
as
i
oh
they
re
great
things
and
i
m
jolly
glad
you
ve
got
this
one
you
ll
enjoy
it
more
every
day
you
own
it
now
here
we
are
at
the
do
you
want
to
turn
in
yes
and
i
m
going
to
turn
you
out
then
i
m
going
to
take
the
car
and
go
back
to
the
station
to
meet
christine
she
s
coming
down
with
let
me
go
over
with
you
then
i
can
give
christine
my
place
and
i
ll
tote
old
hepworth
over
all
right
but
i
must
see
elise
before
i
go
and
tell
her
where
i
m
to
patty
s
surprise
elise
seemed
a
little
annoyed
to
learn
that
she
was
going
to
the
train
for
christine
patty
had
almost
forgotten
the
foolish
jealousy
that
elise
had
of
her
own
friendship
with
christine
but
as
always
she
thought
the
best
way
to
treat
it
was
to
ignore
it
she
simply
repeated
her
statement
yes
elise
she
said
i
m
going
over
to
the
station
to
bring
christine
home
with
me
hepworth
will
come
over
in
the
stage
he
s
going
to
stay
at
the
hotel
anyway
we
haven
t
room
for
him
here
but
of
course
he
ll
be
over
here
most
of
the
time
roger
is
going
over
with
me
and
then
he
ll
get
out
and
give
christine
his
place
and
he
ll
come
back
with
hepworth
what
will
you
do
while
i
m
gone
will
you
dress
for
dinner
or
will
you
take
a
little
rest
they
were
in
elise
s
room
and
her
pretty
gowns
and
other
finery
were
lying
about
as
she
had
unpacked
them
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
about
me
she
said
ungraciously
you
go
on
and
meet
your
friend
christine
and
i
ll
look
after
elise
stop
being
a
goose
cried
patty
grasping
her
by
the
shoulders
and
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
if
you
talk
like
that
you
ll
spoil
my
whole
house
party
and
my
birthday
and
everything
now
you
re
my
friend
and
christine
is
my
friend
and
you
two
girls
have
simply
got
to
be
friends
with
each
other
so
make
your
mind
up
to
that
if
you
say
another
snippy
word
on
the
subject
i
ll
go
and
lock
myself
in
my
own
room
and
stay
there
until
you
go
home
elise
laughed
for
she
was
always
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
after
an
exhibition
of
her
petty
jealousy
and
patty
knew
that
she
wouldn
t
repeat
the
offence
for
the
present
at
least
you
ring
for
louise
patty
went
on
to
help
you
put
away
these
pretty
frocks
and
things
and
then
you
make
yourself
at
home
and
do
just
what
you
want
to
until
i
come
back
with
christine
and
then
milady
you
will
be
just
as
sweet
and
charming
to
christine
as
you
can
possibly
be
catch
on
yes
said
elise
smiling
and
patty
kissed
her
again
and
ran
away
chapter
xii
a
moonlight
ride
patty
seemed
a
little
quiet
as
she
and
roger
drove
to
the
station
for
she
was
thinking
how
foolish
elise
was
and
what
a
lot
of
trouble
she
could
stir
up
if
she
chose
to
indulge
in
that
stupid
jealousy
of
christine
if
christine
had
been
more
able
to
resent
it
and
take
her
own
part
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
but
she
was
so
sensitive
to
the
slightest
coldness
and
so
afraid
of
seeming
to
impose
on
patty
s
friendship
that
it
made
the
situation
a
little
difficult
but
roger
s
gay
banter
revived
patty
s
drooping
spirits
and
when
they
reached
the
station
they
were
in
a
gale
of
laughter
over
some
joking
nonsense
the
train
soon
arrived
and
they
saw
christine
and
hepworth
step
down
on
to
the
station
platform
roger
met
them
and
conducted
them
to
patty
then
there
were
more
compliments
and
congratulations
on
the
new
car
and
soon
christine
was
tucked
in
beside
patty
and
the
two
men
waved
them
farewell
how
are
you
christine
asked
patty
looking
anxiously
at
the
girl
s
pale
cheeks
oh
i
m
all
right
a
little
tired
but
a
day
or
two
down
here
will
set
me
up
wonderfully
i
a
day
or
two
you
must
stay
a
week
at
no
i
can
t
possibly
patty
my
work
is
very
important
just
now
and
i
must
go
back
day
after
we
ll
see
about
that
and
patty
wagged
her
head
positively
and
look
here
christine
while
i
have
you
by
yourself
i
want
to
tell
you
something
elise
farrington
is
here
you
know
and
she
has
a
silly
notion
of
some
sort
that
makes
her
resent
my
friendship
for
you
now
i
want
to
ask
you
as
a
special
favour
to
me
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
her
foolishness
if
she
snubs
you
right
out
i
ll
attend
to
her
case
myself
but
if
she
just
flings
little
bits
of
hateful
allusions
at
you
don
t
mind
them
will
you
dear
i
can
t
help
it
patty
unkind
speeches
shrivel
me
all
up
somehow
i
just
can
t
stand
them
well
stand
them
for
my
sake
please
you
know
can
t
help
it
and
if
i
had
thought
you
wouldn
t
have
a
good
time
i
wouldn
t
have
asked
you
here
when
elise
is
here
but
you
see
it
s
my
birthday
house
party
and
i
want
all
of
my
dearest
friends
with
and
you
count
me
among
them
oh
patty
how
good
you
are
to
me
truly
i
will
try
not
to
be
foolishly
sensitive
and
i
promise
not
to
notice
anything
elise
may
do
or
say
if
i
can
possibly
help
that
s
a
good
girl
said
patty
giving
christine
s
arm
a
little
squeeze
but
isn
t
it
funny
christine
that
i
have
these
little
petty
troubles
among
my
girl
friends
and
never
among
my
boy
friends
the
boys
are
all
so
nice
to
me
and
they
never
get
jealous
of
each
other
or
anything
silly
like
that
but
you
see
this
place
we
re
just
passing
it
s
called
red
chimneys
and
i
have
a
girl
friend
in
there
least
she
s
an
acquaintance
makes
me
a
lot
of
trouble
i
don
t
make
you
trouble
patty
do
i
well
of
course
it
s
mostly
elise
s
fault
but
if
you
ll
just
ignore
it
and
stand
up
for
your
own
rights
you
can
help
me
a
whole
i
will
patty
indeed
i
will
said
christine
earnestly
and
then
they
arrived
at
the
dinner
that
night
was
a
gay
and
jolly
feast
it
was
the
eve
of
the
birthday
and
the
house
party
had
already
assumed
an
air
of
festivity
van
reypen
and
kenneth
harper
had
come
down
later
than
the
others
and
philip
van
reypen
had
established
himself
at
the
hotel
where
hepworth
was
while
kenneth
was
a
house
guest
at
the
but
the
men
from
the
hotel
came
over
to
dinner
and
announced
their
intention
of
staying
as
late
as
they
would
be
allowed
also
to
patty
s
dismay
mona
galbraith
had
come
over
just
before
dinner
and
as
she
was
still
there
when
dinner
was
announced
nan
felt
herself
really
obliged
to
ask
the
girl
to
dine
with
them
patty
didn
t
like
it
at
all
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
so
mona
stayed
she
looked
very
pretty
that
night
and
was
not
quite
so
overdressed
as
usual
moreover
she
made
herself
bright
and
entertaining
without
showing
any
of
her
less
desirable
traits
of
character
seated
between
roger
and
van
reypen
she
ingratiated
herself
with
both
and
when
patty
saw
that
the
boys
seemed
to
like
mona
she
felt
rather
glad
she
was
there
after
dinner
they
all
drifted
out
to
the
verandas
and
as
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
high
breakers
were
dashing
in
on
the
beach
there
was
the
usual
chorus
of
admiration
for
the
glories
of
the
seashore
there
was
much
gay
chatter
and
laughter
there
was
some
desultory
singing
of
songs
and
at
last
elise
jumped
up
saying
i
just
can
t
stand
it
any
longer
i
simply
go
down
to
the
beach
will
anybody
go
with
me
i
will
said
kenneth
gallantly
i
was
just
thinking
about
that
myself
anybody
else
want
to
go
i
want
to
go
said
christine
a
little
timidly
and
patty
looked
up
in
surprise
at
the
idea
of
christine
wanting
to
go
with
elise
anywhere
but
christine
was
longing
to
get
down
to
the
water
and
see
the
ocean
nearer
by
for
it
was
about
two
blocks
from
the
pebbles
though
no
buildings
intervened
mayn
t
i
go
with
you
christine
said
hepworth
and
with
a
glance
of
gratitude
christine
said
yes
come
on
then
sung
out
kenneth
all
ashore
that
s
going
let
s
all
but
roger
said
that
the
ocean
must
wait
for
him
until
next
day
for
he
was
going
over
to
red
chimneys
with
miss
galbraith
just
then
what
for
asked
patty
in
amazement
he
wants
to
see
father
s
birds
explained
mona
you
know
my
father
has
a
really
wonderful
collection
of
stuffed
birds
he
ll
be
delighted
to
show
them
to
farrington
who
says
he
is
interested
in
all
right
said
patty
run
along
you
two
but
don
t
stay
late
roger
we
keep
early
hours
down
all
right
patty
i
won
t
and
roger
walked
away
with
miss
galbraith
while
patty
looked
after
them
with
a
puzzled
glance
the
four
who
wanted
to
walk
to
the
beach
had
already
started
leaving
the
two
senior
fairfields
and
patty
and
van
reypen
on
the
veranda
it
s
perfectly
heavenly
to
get
away
from
the
city
and
down
to
this
beautiful
quiet
peaceful
spot
said
philip
van
reypen
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
veranda
railing
and
leaned
against
a
pillar
is
your
life
in
the
city
so
full
of
strife
that
you
welcome
peace
asked
patty
smiling
oh
the
city
itself
is
full
of
strife
returned
van
reypen
isn
t
it
fairfield
yes
compared
to
the
seashore
it
certainly
is
this
expanse
of
blue
ocean
is
much
more
peaceful
and
calm
than
a
scene
in
wall
street
for
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
and
to
get
down
here
and
just
bask
in
the
calmness
and
peace
is
a
great
delight
to
me
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
people
to
ask
we
like
to
have
you
here
said
nan
smiling
at
the
young
man
s
frank
and
heartfelt
gratitude
and
i
think
it
s
good
of
you
to
come
said
patty
for
you
must
have
lots
of
invitations
to
grander
houses
than
my
child
said
philip
van
reypen
looking
at
her
gravely
it
is
not
the
grandeur
of
a
house
that
attracts
me
it
s
the
grandeur
of
the
people
and
i
think
you
people
are
just
grand
but
tell
me
how
do
you
like
the
motor
car
which
you
won
by
such
strenuous
exertion
which
you
helped
me
to
win
said
patty
i
never
could
have
won
it
without
your
help
and
to
think
you
haven
t
seen
it
come
out
to
the
garage
now
and
take
a
look
at
it
i
ve
never
seen
it
by
moonlight
myself
and
i
know
it
must
look
catching
up
a
light
wrap
patty
flung
it
around
her
and
with
van
reypen
walked
around
the
house
to
the
garage
the
full
moon
was
so
very
bright
that
when
the
young
man
opened
the
big
doors
patty
s
car
showed
as
clearly
and
plainly
as
if
it
had
been
daylight
isn
t
she
a
beauty
said
patty
in
a
voice
almost
awestruck
for
the
moonlight
touched
up
the
car
with
a
sort
of
magic
lustre
never
seen
by
day
she
sure
is
declared
young
van
reypen
with
emphasis
wow
what
perfection
of
detail
and
what
beautiful
finish
can
you
run
it
can
i
run
it
well
rather
why
i
ve
run
it
hundreds
of
miles
since
i
ve
had
it
let
s
get
her
out
now
and
just
circle
the
drive
oh
it
s
too
late
now
i
ll
take
you
out
in
it
nonsense
it
s
only
about
ten
o
clock
and
it
s
as
light
as
noonday
come
on
let
s
do
all
right
i
don
t
mind
but
just
around
the
drive
we
won
t
go
out
of
the
all
right
then
hop
in
let
me
but
i
want
to
show
off
my
oh
wait
until
for
that
miss
vanity
i
know
you
drive
beautifully
but
i
want
to
see
how
this
thing
works
myself
you
know
i
guessed
some
few
of
those
yes
i
know
you
did
all
right
then
you
philip
assisted
patty
in
and
then
took
his
own
place
and
grasped
the
and
the
controller
my
but
she
is
a
daisy
all
the
modern
kinks
in
the
way
of
mechanism
they
circled
the
driveway
twice
and
when
passing
the
veranda
patty
turned
to
wave
her
hand
to
her
father
and
nan
she
discovered
they
were
not
there
why
they
must
have
gone
in
she
said
in
surprise
perhaps
they
went
down
to
the
beach
suggested
van
reypen
let
s
go
and
they
were
near
the
gateway
then
and
before
patty
knew
it
philip
had
swung
the
car
through
and
they
were
spinning
along
the
shore
road
the
top
of
the
car
was
down
and
they
had
an
unobstructed
view
of
sea
and
shore
the
night
was
still
save
for
the
pounding
of
the
surf
and
the
crested
billows
frothed
and
dashed
on
the
white
sand
the
moon
touched
everything
with
its
magic
and
the
sea
the
beach
and
the
inland
were
alike
shining
with
a
silver
glory
the
smooth
hard
road
stretched
ahead
of
them
like
a
white
ribbon
and
it
was
small
wonder
that
philip
van
reypen
did
not
stifle
the
impulse
to
send
the
car
spinning
ahead
oh
breathed
patty
entranced
by
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
night
and
the
exhilaration
of
that
swift
soundless
gliding
motion
through
it
isn
t
it
great
whispered
philip
did
you
know
anything
like
it
no
i
did
it
s
like
being
in
some
enchanted
place
i
ve
never
before
been
out
at
and
there
never
was
such
a
night
as
this
are
you
afraid
oh
no
not
a
bit
i
know
my
car
too
well
and
i
know
you
are
not
driving
recklessly
though
we
are
going
pretty
philip
slowed
down
his
speed
a
little
and
they
went
steadily
on
we
oughtn
t
to
be
doing
this
said
patty
laughing
like
a
gleeful
child
why
not
asked
her
companion
in
an
aggrieved
tone
oh
lots
of
reasons
for
one
thing
i
m
a
yes
but
you
haven
t
any
guests
they
ve
all
scooted
off
by
themselves
in
different
directions
even
your
father
and
mother
deserted
the
veranda
so
i
m
the
only
guest
you
have
for
the
moment
and
i
assure
you
i
m
being
very
pleasantly
so
am
i
said
patty
demurely
but
somehow
i
have
an
uneasy
feeling
that
i
ll
catch
a
scolding
for
this
i
m
not
accustomed
to
going
out
with
a
young
man
late
at
oh
well
i
m
not
very
young
and
it
isn
t
very
late
so
don
t
bother
about
that
and
anyway
if
you
re
going
to
catch
a
scolding
you
may
as
well
have
the
fun
first
and
it
fun
isn
t
it
oh
it
s
gorgeous
fun
i
never
enjoyed
anything
more
but
we
mustn
t
go
any
further
we
re
about
three
miles
beyond
spring
beach
sure
enough
they
had
gone
beyond
all
signs
of
habitation
and
were
on
a
long
straight
stretch
of
road
with
the
ocean
on
one
side
and
pine
woods
on
the
other
it
was
weirdly
beautiful
dark
shadows
of
the
pines
darker
than
ever
by
contrast
with
the
moonlighted
spaces
there
was
no
boardwalk
here
and
the
sea
dashed
almost
up
to
the
road
they
were
on
all
right
said
philip
in
answer
to
patty
s
suggestion
we
will
turn
around
in
a
minute
we
ll
just
go
to
that
next
clump
of
pines
and
then
we
ll
turn
he
lowered
the
speed
and
they
crawled
slowly
along
toward
the
trees
he
had
indicated
it
s
perfect
sighed
patty
drinking
in
the
beauty
all
around
her
i
m
glad
you
helped
me
guess
those
questions
or
i
never
should
have
had
this
experience
except
for
one
moonlight
night
in
venice
i
ve
never
seen
anything
so
then
you
re
glad
i
brought
you
if
it
a
case
of
kidnapping
yes
said
patty
while
a
demure
smile
dimpled
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
i
think
i
like
being
kidnapped
are
you
going
to
hold
me
for
ransom
i
d
like
to
but
nobody
could
offer
a
ransom
big
enough
to
get
you
back
now
a
pretty
speech
and
patty
nodded
her
head
approvingly
so
as
there
s
no
ransom
to
be
considered
please
take
me
back
to
my
fond
parents
for
i
have
no
doubt
they
re
scared
to
death
wondering
where
i
chapter
xiii
patty
s
ingenuity
philip
turned
the
car
around
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
swiftly
speeding
toward
home
it
s
awfully
good
of
you
he
said
to
give
me
this
little
bit
of
your
time
all
to
i
don
t
think
i
gave
it
observed
patty
smiling
i
think
you
took
it
when
i
wasn
t
yes
and
when
no
one
else
was
looking
or
i
mightn
t
have
succeeded
so
well
but
it
s
been
a
gorgeous
ride
and
now
i
m
going
to
take
you
right
back
to
home
and
mother
do
you
suppose
those
people
who
went
to
see
the
ocean
are
still
looking
at
it
if
so
it
will
be
fun
to
drive
right
down
to
oh
don
t
try
it
camilla
cuts
up
dreadfully
if
she
gets
stuck
in
the
sand
it
s
the
one
thing
she
won
t
stand
all
right
we
ll
go
right
straight
bang
home
then
whew
we
have
come
farther
than
i
thought
we
can
t
see
the
lights
of
spring
beach
no
but
i
know
where
we
are
it
s
about
three
miles
to
spring
beach
put
on
a
good
speed
and
we
ll
soon
do
it
there
s
not
a
thing
in
the
road
and
i
ll
trust
your
fast
all
right
my
lady
here
goes
van
reypen
flung
in
the
highest
speed
and
they
fairly
flew
and
then
quite
suddenly
and
without
any
jar
or
jolt
or
warning
of
any
kind
they
found
themselves
sitting
quite
still
camilla
had
stopped
of
her
own
accord
and
seemed
absolutely
disinclined
to
proceed
there
was
no
noise
and
no
fuss
the
car
simply
stood
motionless
what
did
you
stop
for
asked
patty
turning
an
enquiring
face
toward
van
reypen
i
didn
t
stop
she
stopped
herself
your
friend
camilla
is
not
in
such
haste
to
get
home
as
you
are
and
she
wants
to
see
the
moonlight
on
the
sea
once
nonsense
didn
t
you
truly
stop
the
car
no
truly
i
didn
t
and
what
s
more
i
can
t
make
it
go
then
something
has
happened
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
that
but
it
s
your
car
and
you
know
its
tricks
and
its
manners
what
does
it
mean
when
she
stops
like
this
gently
but
firmly
i
don
t
know
and
patty
looked
blankly
bewildered
she
s
never
done
such
a
thing
before
of
course
something
must
be
out
of
order
i
can
t
think
what
the
tires
are
all
yes
of
course
it
isn
t
a
puncture
but
i
can
t
think
myself
what
it
can
be
well
i
ll
have
to
overhaul
the
engine
and
see
what
i
can
van
reypen
got
out
and
began
to
investigate
but
he
could
find
nothing
wrong
in
any
part
has
the
charge
given
out
he
asked
no
the
batteries
are
all
right
it
was
fully
charged
this
morning
and
i
used
it
very
little
she
s
good
for
eighty
or
ninety
miles
easily
and
i
haven
t
run
twenty
then
i
give
it
up
i
do
know
something
about
cars
but
i
m
much
more
experienced
with
the
gasoline
motors
however
this
is
so
beautifully
made
and
yet
so
really
simple
of
construction
that
i
feel
i
ought
to
understand
it
you
get
out
and
take
a
philip
held
the
lamp
while
patty
peered
anxiously
into
the
motor
she
didn
t
understand
fully
all
the
complicated
parts
but
she
had
a
fair
working
knowledge
of
its
main
principles
and
she
too
was
unable
to
discover
anything
wrong
or
out
of
order
we
re
in
a
lovely
mess
she
observed
cheerfully
as
she
stood
looking
at
philip
yes
we
re
up
against
it
he
rejoined
but
his
tone
was
as
cheerful
as
her
own
and
they
both
laughed
as
they
looked
at
each
other
for
given
a
moonlight
night
and
two
merry
young
people
it
is
not
difficult
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
a
motor
misfortune
now
said
patty
philosophically
what
do
we
do
next
i
m
not
very
familiar
with
this
locality
but
if
there
were
any
chance
of
a
big
car
coming
along
we
d
ask
them
to
tow
us
the
running
gear
of
this
car
is
all
yes
and
so
is
the
steering
gear
and
the
batteries
seem
to
be
in
perfect
order
i
can
t
imagine
what
s
the
matter
however
i
can
inform
you
there
s
precious
little
chance
of
any
car
coming
along
this
way
now
seashore
people
always
go
to
bed
early
and
they
never
ride
at
night
anyhow
no
we
ll
have
to
walk
and
leave
the
car
here
yes
i
hate
to
do
it
but
nobody
can
steal
her
for
she
won
t
but
somebody
might
steal
her
and
tow
her
away
that
is
if
a
car
come
along
and
we
weren
t
oh
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
that
i
don
t
want
to
lose
my
beautiful
car
what
can
we
do
i
don
t
see
anything
to
do
but
to
sit
here
in
the
car
all
night
and
of
course
we
can
t
do
that
nor
can
one
of
us
go
and
one
stay
for
i
wouldn
t
let
you
go
alone
and
i
m
sure
i
wouldn
t
let
you
stay
here
i
think
i
ll
go
said
patty
slowly
you
stay
with
the
car
and
i
ll
walk
home
alone
it
s
only
three
miles
and
i
m
sure
it
s
perfectly
safe
there
s
no
one
abroad
at
this
time
of
patty
i
can
t
let
you
do
it
and
philip
van
reypen
looked
deeply
troubled
i
can
t
let
you
walk
those
three
miles
alone
late
at
but
you
don
t
want
to
go
and
leave
me
here
sitting
alone
in
a
motor
car
no
i
can
t
do
that
and
we
can
t
both
go
we
can
t
both
stay
so
it
s
a
do
you
call
those
things
a
deadlock
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
if
neither
of
us
can
go
and
neither
of
us
can
stay
and
we
can
t
both
go
and
we
can
t
both
stay
isn
t
that
a
pretty
good
imitation
of
a
deadlock
it
certainly
is
now
in
those
lovely
motor
car
novels
that
people
write
somebody
would
come
along
just
in
the
nick
of
time
and
fix
everything
all
right
and
we
d
all
live
happy
ever
yes
but
we
re
not
in
a
novel
and
i
m
positive
nobody
will
come
along
so
late
what
time
is
it
a
little
after
eleven
said
philip
looking
at
his
watch
patty
i
can
t
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
got
you
into
this
scrape
and
i
must
figure
some
way
to
get
you
out
but
it
hasn
t
come
to
me
philip
s
face
was
a
picture
of
despair
he
suddenly
realised
his
responsibility
in
bringing
patty
out
here
at
night
it
was
done
on
a
sudden
impulse
a
mere
frolicsome
whim
and
if
the
car
hadn
t
broken
down
all
would
have
been
well
don
t
take
it
too
seriously
philip
said
patty
in
a
pleading
voice
for
now
that
she
saw
how
he
felt
she
was
sorry
for
him
we
ll
get
out
of
this
somehow
but
truly
i
think
the
only
way
is
for
me
to
walk
home
and
send
father
s
big
car
back
for
you
and
camilla
i
sha
n
t
mind
the
walk
half
as
much
as
i
should
mind
sitting
here
and
waiting
while
you
but
patty
you
can
t
walk
three
miles
in
those
little
patty
looked
down
at
her
little
evening
shoes
with
their
french
heels
they
were
not
suitable
for
a
walk
but
that
was
a
secondary
consideration
i
go
she
said
there
is
no
other
then
i
m
going
with
you
declared
philip
stoutly
and
if
anybody
steals
that
car
i
ll
give
you
another
one
exactly
like
it
i
ll
have
it
built
to
order
with
the
same
specifications
this
whole
affair
is
my
fault
and
i
m
going
to
get
you
out
of
it
the
best
way
i
it
isn
t
your
fault
i
won
t
have
you
say
so
just
because
that
stupid
old
car
chose
the
worst
possible
moment
to
break
down
but
all
the
same
i
don
t
know
how
i
can
walk
three
miles
in
these
slippers
with
you
any
better
than
i
could
without
philip
grinned
when
you
get
tired
i
ll
carry
you
he
declared
i
tell
you
i
m
going
to
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
if
it
takes
all
summer
well
it
will
unless
we
start
pretty
soon
come
on
wait
a
minute
suppose
i
take
those
heels
off
your
shoes
couldn
t
you
walk
better
then
oh
fiddlesticks
i
m
accustomed
to
high
heels
i
can
walk
in
them
all
yes
and
first
thing
you
know
they
ll
throw
you
and
you
ll
twist
your
foot
and
sprain
your
well
then
you
have
to
carry
me
said
patty
laughing
but
before
we
start
do
let
s
try
once
more
to
make
the
car
go
maybe
it
s
nothing
but
but
their
efforts
were
unavailing
and
camilla
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
if
she
never
intended
to
move
again
it
would
be
like
the
said
patty
only
in
that
you
know
every
part
dropped
to
pieces
and
here
nothing
s
the
matter
with
any
but
there
be
something
the
matter
declared
philip
who
was
once
again
examining
the
batteries
and
by
jingo
patty
ve
found
it
you
have
what
is
it
why
the
battery
strap
has
separated
that
s
all
what
is
the
battery
strap
i
don
t
see
any
oh
it
isn
t
a
leather
strap
it
s
this
band
of
lead
that
goes
around
the
battery
but
they
call
it
a
strap
see
this
crack
across
it
oh
that
little
crack
does
that
do
any
harm
why
yes
of
course
it
completely
stops
the
current
you
see
the
two
ends
of
the
strap
almost
touch
if
they
did
touch
we
d
be
all
right
now
if
i
had
a
little
piece
of
lead
to
connect
those
two
parts
where
they
are
separated
i
could
fix
it
in
a
jiffy
got
any
lead
i
don
t
know
look
in
the
just
a
little
piece
of
lead
wire
or
anything
that
s
try
a
lead
pencil
said
patty
but
philip
was
poking
in
the
and
paid
little
attention
to
her
mild
joke
there
isn
t
a
lead
thing
here
he
exclaimed
your
is
too
everlastingly
cleared
up
every
tool
in
a
little
pocket
by
itself
why
don
t
you
have
a
whole
lot
of
old
rubbishy
junk
then
we
might
find
something
for
an
emergency
can
t
you
find
anything
that
will
do
not
a
thing
to
think
that
now
we
ve
found
out
what
the
trouble
is
we
can
t
mend
it
and
such
an
easy
break
to
mend
if
i
just
had
a
scrap
of
lead
well
we
may
as
well
make
up
our
minds
to
oh
dear
sighed
patty
i
didn
t
mind
walking
so
much
when
i
thought
the
car
had
really
broken
down
but
just
that
little
bit
of
a
crevice
in
the
battery
strap
oh
can
t
we
mend
it
somehow
can
t
you
pull
the
strap
out
longer
or
something
no
angel
child
there
s
nothing
doing
without
some
lead
after
this
always
bring
some
lead
in
your
but
i
haven
t
any
ah
that
explains
the
absence
of
the
lead
if
you
had
had
a
pocket
of
course
you
would
have
brought
some
lead
you
re
well
next
time
i
ll
bring
lead
with
me
you
may
be
sure
of
i
hope
you
will
fair
lady
and
may
i
be
here
to
use
it
now
shall
we
start
for
our
moonlight
stroll
wait
a
minute
i
have
a
idea
something
tells
me
your
idea
is
a
good
one
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
or
not
i
m
afraid
it
isn
t
and
i
m
afraid
to
tell
you
what
it
is
for
fear
you
ll
laugh
at
i
laugh
i
a
man
in
charge
of
a
motor
and
a
fair
young
girl
with
french
heels
and
midnight
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
laugh
nay
nay
i
m
in
no
laughing
mood
well
if
you
ll
promise
not
to
laugh
i
ll
tell
you
rather
i
ll
show
from
a
little
utility
case
which
was
tucked
away
under
the
seat
of
the
motor
patty
drew
out
a
package
of
sweet
chocolate
i
always
carry
chocolate
with
me
she
said
because
it
tastes
so
good
when
it
s
when
the
chocolate
s
dusty
no
of
course
not
when
the
road
s
dusty
and
your
throat
s
dusty
s
awful
good
as
she
talked
patty
had
torn
off
the
outer
wrapper
and
showed
the
chocolate
neatly
wrapped
in
tinfoil
she
took
this
off
carefully
and
tossing
the
chocolate
aside
folded
the
tinfoil
into
a
long
strip
while
philip
gazed
at
her
with
dawning
admiration
in
his
eyes
there
s
your
lead
she
said
simply
as
she
handed
him
the
strip
patty
you
re
a
genius
he
exclaimed
a
perfect
genius
how
did
you
think
of
that
will
it
do
do
of
course
it
will
do
it
s
just
the
very
thing
i
ll
wrap
it
around
that
separated
battery
strap
and
we
ll
be
off
in
two
minutes
in
really
less
than
two
minutes
van
reypen
had
wound
the
strip
of
tinfoil
in
its
place
had
jumped
into
the
car
beside
patty
who
was
already
in
and
they
were
flying
along
at
top
speed
how
you
think
of
it
he
asked
again
as
they
skimmed
along
it
was
terribly
clever
of
you
why
i
knew
you
wanted
lead
and
i
knew
tinfoil
was
lead
i
was
stupid
not
to
think
of
it
you
re
a
marvel
to
think
of
it
at
all
it
was
wonderful
oh
not
at
all
that
s
nothing
to
what
i
can
do
when
i
really
try
have
some
chocolate
patty
was
in
gay
spirits
now
for
they
were
flying
homeward
through
the
moonlight
and
she
was
spared
the
walk
and
her
beloved
car
was
safe
in
her
own
possession
yes
i
will
have
some
chocolate
thank
you
we
may
as
well
take
all
the
goods
the
gods
provide
while
we
can
i
m
glad
to
get
you
home
safely
but
i
can
t
honestly
say
that
i
haven
t
enjoyed
this
whole
escapade
can
you
no
said
patty
looking
at
him
with
a
demure
smile
not
i
can
t
but
all
the
same
i
m
glad
we
could
manage
to
ride
home
instead
of
yes
so
am
i
and
it
s
astonishing
how
hungry
i
am
can
you
spare
a
little
more
of
that
chocolate
yes
indeed
and
patty
broke
off
a
generous
bit
but
we
ll
give
you
some
supper
at
the
i
fancy
they
ll
be
rather
glad
to
see
us
yes
said
philip
grinning
and
i
rather
fancy
we
ll
get
a
warm
reception
i
m
not
sure
but
we
deserve
it
chapter
xiv
a
birthday
breakfast
it
was
not
quite
twelve
o
clock
when
the
swift
camilla
swung
through
the
gateway
of
the
pebbles
and
around
the
long
drive
to
the
house
as
might
have
been
expected
the
waiting
group
on
the
veranda
greeted
the
returned
runaways
with
various
but
vociferous
exclamations
several
of
them
said
why
patty
fairfield
several
others
said
where
have
you
been
roger
called
out
cheerily
you
must
have
had
a
ripping
good
time
wish
i
d
been
along
fairfield
said
only
patty
and
hepworth
said
nothing
at
all
but
looked
at
patty
with
an
unmistakable
expression
of
reproof
philip
van
reypen
took
the
brunt
of
the
situation
upon
himself
he
jumped
out
of
the
car
assisted
patty
out
and
led
her
straight
to
her
father
mr
fairfield
he
said
here
s
your
daughter
safe
and
sound
i
m
happy
to
say
but
i
want
you
to
decorate
her
with
the
victoria
cross
or
something
just
as
good
for
she
has
proved
herself
a
genius
wonderful
genius
but
for
her
ingenuity
we
should
still
be
sitting
in
her
little
motor
car
high
and
dry
on
a
moonlit
beach
listening
to
the
wild
waves
to
her
all
the
honour
and
glory
and
if
there
is
any
blame
attached
to
our
little
excursion
it
is
mine
i
kidnapped
your
daughter
but
i
fully
meant
to
return
her
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
without
ransom
i
am
no
villain
but
owing
to
an
accident
we
were
i
should
think
you
were
broke
in
fairfield
it
is
nearly
midnight
and
i
papa
interrupted
patty
i
know
exactly
what
you
are
you
are
surprised
astounded
amazed
astonished
dumfounded
taken
aback
struck
all
of
a
heap
and
completely
flabbergasted
if
you
are
anything
else
you
can
let
me
know
meantime
we
are
two
heroes
who
returned
with
our
shield
and
on
it
both
incidentally
we
are
starving
and
if
we
had
some
supper
we
could
relate
our
experiences
in
fine
patty
s
arms
were
round
her
father
s
neck
and
with
a
wheedlesome
expression
her
eyes
looked
up
into
his
and
somehow
fairfield
s
indignation
melted
away
patty
s
quite
right
declared
nan
taking
sides
with
the
culprits
let
s
all
go
to
the
and
then
later
we
ll
hear
about
patty
s
mr
van
reypen
was
just
as
much
of
a
hero
as
i
declared
patty
as
with
her
arm
tucked
through
her
father
s
she
led
the
way
to
the
where
a
dainty
little
supper
had
been
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
missing
ones
it
really
wasn
t
a
matter
of
heroics
said
philip
van
reypen
it
was
only
a
simple
plain
everyday
breakdown
caused
by
a
separated
battery
strap
but
the
glorious
part
of
it
all
was
miss
fairfield
s
cleverness
in
finding
a
remedy
for
the
trouble
when
it
seemed
at
first
there
was
absolutely
and
then
while
they
ate
salad
and
sandwiches
the
interested
audience
listened
to
a
full
description
of
the
breakdown
told
in
philip
van
reypen
s
most
graphic
style
in
no
way
did
he
try
to
evade
the
blame
for
the
escapade
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
ought
not
to
have
taken
patty
off
without
permission
but
so
winning
was
his
frank
manner
and
so
gleeful
his
enjoyment
of
the
whole
recital
that
he
won
the
sympathy
of
all
present
it
s
all
right
philip
my
boy
declared
fairfield
heartily
i
don
t
blame
you
a
bit
for
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
slip
out
of
the
gate
and
of
course
you
could
not
foresee
that
peculiar
accident
and
i
am
proud
of
my
girl
for
thinking
of
a
way
to
fix
the
thing
up
tinfoil
well
well
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
thought
of
that
myself
patty
smiled
and
dimpled
at
the
praises
showered
upon
her
from
all
sides
and
she
caught
an
approving
smile
from
hepworth
which
showed
his
appreciation
of
what
she
had
done
but
i
m
very
sorry
to
have
failed
in
my
duty
as
hostess
she
said
demurely
did
you
manage
to
get
along
without
me
oh
i
was
here
said
nan
gaily
and
i
kept
the
young
people
in
we
did
have
a
lovely
time
patty
said
elise
the
walk
along
the
beach
was
delightful
wasn
t
it
christine
yes
replied
christine
slowly
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
i
didn
t
know
there
was
so
much
beauty
in
the
hepworth
smiled
at
the
rapturous
expression
on
the
face
of
the
southern
girl
and
then
he
declared
that
it
was
quite
time
he
and
van
reypen
should
depart
for
their
own
domicile
but
you
re
to
come
back
here
morning
for
breakfast
said
nan
hospitably
we
ll
breakfast
at
nine
and
inaugurate
patty
s
birthday
which
i
can
assure
you
is
going
to
be
a
pretty
busy
day
for
all
it
s
lovely
to
have
a
birthday
sighed
patty
as
a
few
moments
later
she
went
up
the
broad
staircase
with
her
arms
around
elise
and
christine
who
were
on
either
side
of
her
and
this
is
such
a
lovely
continuous
performance
said
elise
we
ve
had
a
lot
of
fun
already
and
the
birthday
isn
t
really
begun
well
it
has
really
begun
said
patty
because
it
s
after
midnight
and
so
it
s
already
but
we
won
t
have
any
more
celebration
until
breakfast
is
ready
so
girls
and
be
sure
to
be
up
on
time
for
my
birthday
the
girls
obeyed
this
parting
injunction
but
patty
herself
overslept
and
it
was
eight
in
the
morning
when
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
her
two
girl
friends
hovering
over
her
wake
up
said
elise
pulling
patty
s
curls
i
say
patty
how
jolly
it
is
for
you
to
sleep
out
here
but
don
t
you
almost
freeze
oh
no
indeed
i
have
so
much
that
i
sleep
warm
as
toast
but
i
love
to
feel
the
sea
air
blow
on
my
patty
s
sleeping
veranda
was
almost
like
a
room
partially
enclosed
on
three
sides
the
front
was
open
to
the
sea
there
were
broad
wicker
blinds
to
be
drawn
at
will
but
unless
in
case
of
a
very
strong
sea
breeze
they
were
seldom
drawn
the
girls
were
in
their
kimonos
and
patty
sent
them
flying
as
she
sprang
up
herself
go
on
you
two
and
finish
dressing
i
ll
be
ready
before
you
are
now
elise
and
christine
scampered
away
and
patty
began
to
dress
with
all
speed
and
by
nine
o
clock
she
went
downstairs
fresh
and
dainty
in
a
white
embroidered
muslin
frock
with
knots
of
ribbon
elise
and
christine
also
wore
white
dresses
elise
s
being
much
befrilled
and
adorned
while
christine
s
was
far
more
simple
but
each
was
suited
to
the
type
of
girl
who
wore
it
and
when
nan
appeared
also
in
a
white
gown
it
was
a
picturesque
quartette
that
stood
on
the
veranda
looking
at
the
sunlit
sea
here
they
come
cried
elise
as
hepworth
and
van
reypen
appeared
round
the
corner
and
patty
see
they
re
bringing
presents
to
you
just
look
at
their
arms
full
of
tissue
paper
sure
enough
both
the
men
carried
large
parcels
elaborately
done
up
in
tissue
paper
and
bright
ribbons
they
came
up
laughing
and
with
merry
birthday
greetings
to
the
queen
of
the
occasion
breakfast
is
ready
said
nan
we
were
just
waiting
for
you
bring
those
paper
affairs
with
you
to
the
table
there
s
quite
a
collection
there
and
indeed
there
was
the
whole
party
took
their
seats
at
the
large
round
table
and
at
patty
s
place
was
a
veritable
mountain
of
parcels
i
m
overcame
she
exclaimed
it
s
quite
enough
to
have
all
you
lovely
people
come
to
visit
me
without
having
gifts
besides
do
open
them
patty
cried
elise
i
m
crazy
to
see
what
they
are
just
for
that
i
ll
open
yours
first
elise
said
patty
laughing
which
is
it
this
one
replied
elise
touching
a
large
parcel
and
it
s
perfectly
heavenly
patty
i
did
it
every
stitch
myself
i
did
every
stitch
of
mine
too
murmured
roger
if
that
makes
a
present
more
patty
untied
elise
s
gift
and
it
proved
to
be
an
embroidered
muslin
hat
very
frilly
as
to
brim
and
ornamented
with
tiny
how
lovely
cried
patty
thank
you
a
thousand
times
elise
the
idea
of
your
making
those
billions
of
stitches
for
poor
wuthless
me
wouldn
t
you
make
one
for
me
asked
kenneth
if
it
s
a
mark
of
such
devoted
friendship
i
ll
make
you
two
declared
elise
with
a
smiling
glance
at
him
put
it
on
patty
let
s
see
how
it
so
patty
put
on
the
pretty
frilled
hat
and
it
formed
a
most
appropriate
frame
around
her
golden
halo
of
hair
and
her
flushed
face
she
had
never
looked
prettier
and
everybody
present
gave
back
an
answering
smile
to
the
dancing
eyes
and
dimpled
mouth
that
challenged
it
philip
van
reypen
said
by
jove
under
his
breath
and
roger
who
overheard
murmured
yes
and
then
some
then
patty
unwrapped
her
other
gifts
christine
s
came
next
and
it
was
a
beautiful
water
colour
of
her
own
in
a
simple
appropriate
frame
it
s
exquisite
christine
dear
said
patty
and
i
just
love
it
how
you
are
getting
on
this
is
a
real
work
of
art
isn
t
it
hepworth
it
is
truly
good
work
replied
gilbert
hepworth
and
the
approving
glance
he
gave
christine
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
and
made
her
drop
her
eyes
don
t
tell
her
how
lovely
it
is
said
patty
laughing
christine
can
t
stand
praise
in
public
wait
till
i
get
you
alone
girlie
and
then
you
ll
see
if
i
have
a
grateful
nature
oh
open
mine
next
cried
roger
if
you
re
going
to
take
us
apart
and
tell
us
of
your
gratitude
alone
i
want
to
go
right
now
you
can
t
said
patty
you
have
to
be
thanked
right
before
all
the
rest
of
the
people
but
this
is
great
you
know
i
love
these
crazy
patty
had
opened
roger
s
gift
and
it
was
a
grotesque
bronze
figure
representing
some
strange
japanese
god
it
was
fascinating
in
its
very
ugliness
and
was
a
really
beautiful
specimen
of
japanese
craft
you
re
not
eating
any
breakfast
patty
said
hepworth
suddenly
let
me
undo
the
next
parcel
while
you
try
some
of
this
delicious
omelette
i
can
vouch
for
its
all
right
said
patty
i
starving
and
as
a
reward
of
merit
hepworth
i
ll
let
you
untie
your
own
good
i
love
to
be
in
the
limelight
now
this
is
mine
and
may
you
enjoy
it
many
times
when
i
am
far
then
hepworth
displayed
a
very
beautiful
and
complete
automobile
lunch
basket
with
fittings
for
two
it
was
of
the
finest
design
and
workmanship
and
the
appointments
were
of
the
newest
and
best
just
what
i
want
cried
patty
now
i
can
go
out
for
a
picnic
and
it
s
such
a
lovely
picnic
basket
hepworth
you
do
think
of
the
loveliest
things
the
grateful
glance
that
patty
gave
him
was
met
by
one
equally
friendly
and
in
order
to
escape
drawing
further
attention
to
himself
hepworth
quickly
opened
the
next
parcel
this
proved
to
be
philip
van
reypen
s
gift
and
as
it
was
being
opened
he
said
i
too
should
have
liked
to
bring
you
a
really
worthwhile
gift
but
i
felt
miss
fairfield
that
i
m
too
much
of
a
stranger
to
indulge
in
anything
but
the
conventional
books
candy
or
so
i
have
brought
you
only
a
box
of
candy
but
i
hope
you
will
have
many
happy
returns
of
when
i
shall
be
an
old
friend
and
can
give
you
anything
i
he
looked
enviously
at
the
other
men
present
who
had
known
patty
so
much
longer
than
he
had
but
when
his
box
of
candy
was
finally
released
from
its
wrappings
everybody
exclaimed
in
admiration
for
it
was
by
no
means
a
simple
box
but
was
really
a
french
jewel
case
whose
various
compartments
were
lined
with
tufted
blue
satin
and
though
now
filled
with
bonbons
were
intended
to
hold
trinkets
the
outside
was
of
french
brocade
decorated
with
gold
filigree
and
tiny
french
flowers
altogether
it
was
an
exquisite
piece
of
handicraft
and
yet
van
reypen
had
after
all
only
presented
the
conventional
box
of
nan
was
greatly
pleased
at
his
cleverness
she
had
liked
philip
van
reypen
from
the
first
and
he
had
proved
himself
a
cultured
and
intelligent
gentleman
in
every
respect
kenneth
s
gift
was
a
fan
a
mount
with
pearl
sticks
he
had
showed
taste
in
the
selection
and
patty
was
greatly
pleased
with
it
indeed
she
was
enraptured
with
all
her
lovely
gifts
and
fairly
bubbled
over
with
enthusiastic
thanks
this
is
my
present
patty
said
nan
producing
a
very
long
box
it
was
too
big
to
put
on
the
table
with
the
others
so
please
accept
it
with
the
wish
that
it
may
prove
useful
some
the
long
box
contained
a
parasol
which
was
just
the
thing
to
be
carried
with
patty
s
pretty
summer
costumes
oh
nan
what
a
duck
you
are
she
cried
i
suppose
this
is
from
you
and
father
both
as
i
don
t
see
anything
else
from
not
so
not
so
my
child
said
fairfield
taking
a
small
box
from
his
pocket
on
your
nineteenth
birthday
i
want
to
give
you
a
gift
all
by
he
handed
patty
the
box
and
in
it
was
a
pearl
ring
it
was
a
beautiful
pearl
and
not
too
large
for
a
young
girl
to
wear
everybody
admired
it
and
patty
slipped
it
on
her
finger
and
then
holding
her
lace
parasol
open
above
her
head
she
fanned
herself
with
kenneth
s
fan
as
she
still
wore
elise
s
embroidered
hat
she
made
a
pretty
picture
of
a
typical
summer
girl
you
look
like
a
girl
on
a
calendar
said
roger
rather
fussily
gotten
up
but
picturesque
in
a
way
they
all
laughed
at
roger
s
speech
which
really
fitted
the
case
and
then
breakfast
being
over
they
gathered
up
patty
s
treasures
and
adjourned
to
the
hall
chapter
xv
a
morning
swim
now
said
nan
we
must
lay
our
plans
we
re
going
to
celebrate
patty
s
birthday
all
day
long
but
there
isn
t
very
much
time
in
a
day
after
all
so
you
must
all
choose
what
you
think
would
be
the
most
fun
to
do
we
re
going
to
the
country
club
for
luncheon
which
is
a
motor
trip
of
about
twenty
miles
then
we
ll
come
back
and
this
evening
there
will
be
a
little
dinner
dance
which
is
of
course
the
real
birthday
party
now
you
ve
about
two
hours
before
we
start
this
morning
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
m
for
a
dip
in
the
ocean
declared
philip
van
reypen
does
that
hit
anybody
else
me
exclaimed
roger
and
me
too
declared
elise
i
d
love
to
bathe
said
christine
if
it
isn
t
too
cold
is
the
water
chilly
now
patty
it
is
a
little
admitted
patty
at
least
it
was
day
before
yesterday
i
haven
t
been
in
since
but
is
a
whole
lot
warmer
i
don
t
believe
it
will
be
too
cold
let
s
all
go
in
proposed
elise
and
then
if
it
is
too
chilly
we
can
turn
around
and
come
right
out
this
plan
suited
and
the
girls
ran
away
for
their
bathing
suits
patty
s
was
white
trimmed
with
light
blue
and
was
exceedingly
becoming
her
gold
curls
were
tied
up
in
a
silk
handkerchief
from
which
a
few
ringlets
persisted
in
escaping
though
she
kept
tucking
them
back
let
them
hang
down
patty
said
roger
the
salt
water
won
t
take
the
curl
out
no
said
patty
laughing
it
makes
it
curl
tighter
than
ever
i
envy
you
that
said
christine
i
always
wanted
curly
you
needn
t
said
patty
your
soft
sleek
bands
are
much
better
suited
to
your
face
than
my
corkscrews
would
hepworth
laughed
at
this
for
patty
s
curls
when
wet
turned
into
veritable
corkscrews
which
hung
from
her
temples
like
those
of
an
belle
christine
s
rather
plain
bathing
suit
was
of
navy
blue
trimmed
with
white
braid
but
elise
was
gorgeous
in
a
suit
of
scarlet
and
black
with
her
hair
tied
up
in
a
red
bandanna
nan
s
suit
was
entirely
of
black
and
was
both
pretty
and
becoming
and
as
van
reypen
surveyed
the
group
he
said
well
you
a
bunch
of
naiads
you
look
like
one
of
sorolla
s
pictures
except
that
we
haven
t
any
of
his
light
and
h
m
commented
hepworth
much
you
know
about
sorolla
s
work
if
you
express
it
in
those
well
you
see
i
m
not
an
artist
said
van
reypen
for
hepworth
s
tone
was
so
he
couldn
t
feel
annoyed
who
can
swim
philip
went
on
i
m
for
a
long
dash
out
to
that
farthest
i
can
swim
returned
patty
but
i
won
t
go
as
far
out
as
that
buoy
i
ll
swim
part
come
on
then
and
the
two
splashed
into
the
breakers
patty
was
a
good
swimmer
and
there
was
not
much
surf
that
morning
so
she
had
no
trouble
in
keeping
up
with
philip
for
a
fairly
good
distance
then
she
said
now
i
m
going
to
turn
back
van
reypen
i
ve
learned
by
experience
that
it
is
better
to
turn
back
while
we
van
reypen
looked
at
her
reproachfully
as
they
swam
slowly
side
by
side
you
called
me
philip
last
night
he
said
i
know
it
and
patty
smiled
roguishly
but
you
see
that
was
under
stress
of
a
great
emergency
i
scarcely
realised
what
i
was
doing
i
hope
you
ll
forgive
i
ll
forgive
you
only
on
condition
that
you
never
call
me
van
reypen
again
and
that
you
give
me
permission
to
call
you
aren
t
you
demanding
a
great
deal
yes
i
am
indeed
but
you
are
so
that
i
have
a
hope
of
your
i
ll
race
you
to
shore
for
it
said
patty
if
you
win
first
names
go
if
i
win
we
shall
continue
with
the
more
formal
all
right
it
s
an
unfair
advantage
but
i
m
going
to
take
it
of
course
i
can
beat
you
swimming
to
shore
but
i
ll
lag
behind
a
little
and
let
you
think
you
re
winning
and
then
pass
you
with
a
grand
oh
i
don
t
know
said
patty
teasingly
and
then
they
both
headed
toward
shore
and
swam
rapidly
as
he
had
proposed
philip
kept
a
few
lengths
behind
her
meanwhile
gasping
and
shouting
that
he
was
almost
exhausted
and
that
he
feared
he
could
never
reach
land
patty
knew
this
was
merely
joking
and
that
soon
with
a
few
strong
strokes
he
would
pass
her
and
come
in
a
long
distance
ahead
but
she
had
no
intention
of
being
beaten
so
easily
when
nearly
halfway
to
land
she
saw
kenneth
swimming
toward
her
as
they
met
she
said
turn
round
and
swim
with
me
ken
quick
he
did
so
and
patty
went
on
talking
rapidly
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
ken
let
me
go
on
and
you
turn
and
delay
van
reypen
i
don
t
care
what
you
do
to
him
duck
him
or
tease
him
in
any
way
somehow
or
other
keep
him
back
until
i
reach
shore
and
don
t
let
him
know
you
re
doing
it
all
right
count
on
me
and
kenneth
turned
and
circled
leisurely
around
until
he
came
face
to
face
with
philip
van
reypen
hello
he
said
you
re
a
ripping
good
swimmer
i
want
to
show
you
a
new
stunt
i
learned
lately
mighty
few
could
appreciate
it
as
i
know
you
some
other
time
harper
hastily
spoke
van
reypen
i
want
to
speak
to
miss
fairfield
just
oh
she
won
t
mind
said
kenneth
taking
care
to
keep
directly
in
van
reypen
s
way
you
see
you
start
sideways
and
oh
i
say
harper
wait
till
some
other
time
let
me
pass
please
i
ll
be
back
in
ten
minutes
and
glad
to
learn
your
new
well
you
needn
t
be
stuffy
about
it
oh
i
m
not
stuffy
my
boy
then
i
ll
show
you
now
you
see
you
swim
on
one
side
and
before
van
reypen
realised
what
was
happening
to
him
kenneth
had
grasped
his
arm
and
gently
but
steadily
pushed
him
around
until
he
was
headed
out
to
sea
again
at
this
moment
patty
reached
the
beach
as
kenneth
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
suddenly
changing
his
tone
he
said
by
george
van
reypen
i
believe
you
were
in
earnest
in
that
case
i
m
sorry
i
insisted
of
course
i
ll
teach
you
the
trick
some
other
time
go
ahead
if
you
want
to
speak
to
miss
fairfield
she
s
right
over
thus
disarmed
philip
couldn
t
answer
kenneth
angrily
and
suppressing
his
chagrin
he
said
all
right
old
chap
and
thank
you
we
ll
go
for
a
swim
together
morning
and
then
i
ll
be
glad
to
learn
your
new
kenneth
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
his
subterfuge
for
he
was
of
a
frank
honest
nature
but
he
had
done
it
for
patty
and
he
felt
sure
that
the
whole
thing
was
some
merry
jest
freed
from
his
tormentor
van
reypen
struck
out
swiftly
for
the
shore
and
the
next
moment
throwing
himself
on
to
a
big
breaker
he
was
washed
up
on
the
beach
at
patty
s
side
how
do
you
do
van
reypen
said
that
mischievous
damsel
smiling
at
him
under
her
corkscrew
curls
it
wasn
t
fair
growled
philip
i
was
delayed
harper
stopped
me
and
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
him
oh
that
s
a
pretty
excuse
chaffed
patty
i
heard
you
say
that
you
were
almost
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
and
you
puffing
like
a
whale
oh
that
was
mere
foolery
i
didn
t
mean
a
word
of
it
i
m
not
a
bit
blown
i
could
swim
for
miles
that
all
sounds
very
well
but
i
think
you
ll
have
to
admit
that
i
won
the
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
i
admit
gracefully
that
you
did
reach
the
beach
first
and
i
herewith
relinquish
all
hope
of
ever
being
allowed
the
privilege
i
had
oh
don
t
give
up
too
easily
said
patty
though
she
well
knew
that
his
speech
was
not
made
in
earnest
come
along
patty
cried
nan
unless
you
want
to
go
motoring
in
a
wet
bathing
suit
you
must
scamper
into
some
dry
clothes
come
along
with
us
we
re
all
going
the
crowd
of
bathers
dispersed
and
as
there
was
need
for
expedition
in
less
than
a
half
an
hour
they
reassembled
clad
in
civilian
s
garb
and
all
ready
for
the
picnic
the
girls
light
frocks
were
covered
with
voluminous
and
they
all
wore
pretty
or
bonnets
of
silks
three
cars
were
necessary
to
accommodate
the
luncheon
party
and
it
was
quite
a
gala
procession
that
started
from
the
first
was
fairfield
s
own
big
car
driven
by
miller
and
containing
fairfield
and
nan
christine
and
hepworth
this
was
followed
by
a
runabout
which
fairfield
had
engaged
for
the
occasion
and
which
was
driven
by
roger
this
car
held
two
in
front
with
a
small
rear
seat
for
another
philip
van
reypen
sat
next
to
roger
and
elise
sat
alone
in
the
small
back
seat
saying
she
had
always
wanted
to
try
such
a
position
but
had
never
before
had
opportunity
hang
on
then
sis
warned
roger
as
they
started
for
i
don
t
want
to
stop
and
run
back
to
pick
you
up
all
the
no
danger
said
elise
merrily
but
it
is
fun
i
feel
like
an
enthroned
you
look
like
one
too
said
van
reypen
getting
in
beside
roger
and
we
are
your
two
in
the
swift
camilla
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
in
it
were
patty
and
kenneth
kenneth
had
begged
for
this
arrangement
as
he
said
he
had
not
yet
had
a
ride
in
patty
s
new
car
neither
have
i
declared
hepworth
and
after
a
moment
s
consideration
patty
said
that
she
would
take
kenneth
half
the
way
and
then
exchange
him
for
hepworth
and
nothing
could
be
fairer
nor
that
declared
kenneth
as
he
accepted
his
fate
it
was
a
perfect
day
for
clear
and
not
too
cool
spring
flowers
were
in
bloom
in
the
gardens
and
palms
and
shrubbery
carefully
kept
made
the
lawns
picturesque
ideal
place
to
spend
a
summer
said
kenneth
to
patty
as
they
flew
along
and
great
roads
for
yes
it
is
agreed
patty
the
others
want
to
go
to
the
mountains
in
august
but
i
m
just
crazy
to
stay
here
all
summer
perhaps
i
can
persuade
them
to
go
off
by
themselves
and
leave
me
here
i
could
have
some
one
to
chaperon
of
course
you
could
that
would
be
gay
i
expect
aunt
rachel
would
come
if
you
wanted
she
s
a
dear
old
thing
i
d
like
better
but
i
haven
t
dared
broach
the
subject
yet
don
t
say
anything
about
all
right
i
won
t
but
i
say
patty
what
was
that
deal
you
had
on
with
van
reypen
he
was
awful
mad
when
i
held
him
up
out
in
the
oh
it
was
nothing
but
foolishness
said
patty
laughing
at
the
recollection
i
promised
him
that
if
he
beat
me
to
the
shore
we
d
call
each
other
by
our
first
names
that
was
a
wager
exclaimed
kenneth
in
disgruntled
tones
why
patty
you
don
t
know
that
chap
well
enough
to
call
him
by
his
first
name
nonsense
ken
i
m
not
and
well
he
is
patty
laughed
mischievously
he
is
but
he
isn
t
a
bit
i
should
say
not
i
can
tell
you
i
didn
t
like
the
way
he
carted
you
off
last
night
oh
kenneth
what
a
goose
you
are
you
know
the
whole
story
of
that
performance
he
couldn
t
help
the
strap
breaking
and
if
my
father
didn
t
bother
about
it
i
don
t
think
you
need
to
that
s
the
same
as
telling
me
it
s
none
of
my
well
i
didn
t
mean
it
exactly
that
way
but
all
the
same
it
isn
t
don
t
you
like
van
reypen
yes
i
do
he
s
a
rattling
good
chap
but
i
don
t
want
him
coming
down
here
and
monopolising
you
for
motoring
and
swimming
and
everything
else
i
s
pose
you
ll
give
him
every
other
dance
patty
drew
down
the
corners
of
her
lips
and
made
a
sobbing
sound
in
her
throat
as
if
she
were
on
the
verge
of
bursting
into
tears
t
me
she
pleaded
in
a
voice
which
she
meant
to
sound
tearful
but
which
was
choking
with
laughter
and
didn
t
fool
kenneth
a
bit
you
re
a
little
coquette
that
s
what
you
are
patty
and
i
won
t
stand
it
i
knew
you
long
before
van
reypen
did
and
he
s
not
going
to
cut
me
out
i
can
tell
you
good
gracious
kenneth
i
should
say
he
wasn
t
why
he
s
only
an
acquaintance
and
you
re
one
of
my
oldest
friends
of
course
i
am
and
patty
s
hearty
tone
made
kenneth
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
his
flash
of
jealousy
well
then
don
t
let
me
hear
any
more
such
foolish
talk
here
i
am
taking
you
in
my
dear
little
car
and
instead
of
appreciating
it
you
scold
me
all
to
pieces
forgive
me
patty
i
am
a
brute
but
somehow
van
reypen
has
such
a
way
with
him
he
acts
as
if
he
owned
you
and
this
and
the
pebbles
and
father
and
nan
supplemented
patty
going
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
well
ken
i
can
t
see
any
way
for
you
to
get
even
with
him
but
to
act
as
if
you
owned
us
all
i
can
t
do
it
said
kenneth
i
haven
t
that
arrogance
of
what
a
pity
said
patty
looking
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
chapter
xvi
a
change
of
partners
their
foolish
little
squabble
over
patty
and
kenneth
were
as
good
chums
as
ever
and
they
skimmed
along
in
the
same
satisfied
friendliness
they
always
felt
when
together
all
too
soon
in
kenneth
s
opinion
they
had
traversed
half
their
journey
and
reached
the
place
where
it
had
been
arranged
that
patty
was
to
change
her
companion
and
give
hepworth
his
ride
the
big
car
was
waiting
for
them
as
they
came
along
and
though
kenneth
said
confound
it
to
patty
under
his
breath
no
one
else
heard
it
and
he
exchanged
places
with
hepworth
with
a
smiling
agreeable
countenance
the
transfer
being
effected
the
two
cars
started
on
again
patty
drove
and
hepworth
watched
her
with
admiration
and
interest
you
re
a
wonderful
child
he
said
you
can
do
almost
anything
you
turn
your
hand
indeed
i
can
t
returned
patty
i
can
t
paint
like
oh
well
that
s
a
special
talent
of
hers
your
special
talent
is
your
singing
but
i
mean
you
can
do
all
sorts
of
other
things
like
guessing
puzzles
and
running
motor
yes
so
i
can
but
don
t
forget
that
if
you
hadn
t
guessed
that
last
charade
for
me
and
an
unfair
one
at
that
i
never
should
have
had
this
car
so
you
see
the
car
is
partly
well
i
ll
take
out
my
share
in
going
riding
with
wouldn
t
you
like
to
drive
it
yourself
some
day
hepworth
you
could
take
christine
christine
i
d
rather
take
rather
take
than
christine
farley
patty
s
blue
eyes
opened
wide
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
her
surprise
at
this
statement
was
unfeigned
and
by
no
means
a
bit
of
coquetry
but
it
piqued
gilbert
hepworth
and
he
answered
a
little
shortly
you
know
i
would
why
do
you
pretend
otherwise
i
don
t
know
any
such
thing
christine
is
your
special
and
aren
t
you
my
special
friend
why
not
exactly
and
patty
s
cheeks
dimpled
as
she
smiled
i
m
your
special
friend
s
daughter
isn
t
daddy
your
special
friend
yes
of
course
and
hepworth
looked
decidedly
cross
as
he
always
did
when
reminded
of
the
difference
of
age
between
himself
and
patty
thing
which
patty
never
seemed
to
forget
but
just
now
he
went
on
you
re
so
absorbed
in
your
special
friend
van
reypen
that
you
have
no
thought
of
anybody
for
the
land
s
sake
exclaimed
patty
and
that
s
an
expression
i
use
only
on
the
strongest
provocation
but
i
ll
tell
you
something
hepworth
she
looked
at
him
squarely
when
kenneth
harper
was
with
me
just
now
he
held
me
up
on
account
of
what
he
called
my
friendship
for
van
reypen
now
if
you
re
going
to
do
the
same
thing
i
give
you
fair
warning
i
ll
put
you
out
and
i
ll
take
philip
van
reypen
in
this
car
so
there
now
hepworth
laughed
at
the
flashing
eyes
and
the
cheeks
that
faced
him
very
much
like
an
angry
kitten
forgive
us
both
patty
he
said
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
ridiculous
situation
you
see
the
truth
is
kenneth
and
i
are
both
jealous
of
your
new
friend
and
you
ll
probably
find
that
roger
is
in
the
same
unenviable
frame
of
and
fiddlesticks
and
exclaimed
patty
you
people
all
make
me
tired
you
do
as
you
know
i
adore
all
my
friends
and
i
want
them
all
to
adore
me
and
when
i
make
new
friends
they
ve
all
got
to
adore
each
other
too
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
but
don
t
you
worry
over
old
roger
he
s
fallen
a
victim
to
the
charms
of
mona
galbraith
i
never
was
so
surprised
in
my
life
you
know
i
don
t
like
that
girl
very
much
and
last
night
as
soon
as
roger
met
her
they
immediately
fell
into
a
deep
friendship
why
don
t
you
like
her
oh
she
isn
t
exactly
our
sort
she
s
a
little
forward
a
little
pushing
and
a
little
lacking
in
certain
varieties
of
good
taste
but
she
s
and
generous
and
if
she
had
had
proper
training
would
have
been
an
awfully
nice
can
t
you
help
her
patty
yes
hepworth
i
can
but
i
don
t
want
why
don
t
you
want
to
only
because
i
m
a
horrid
thing
i
know
that
if
i
begin
to
help
her
she
ll
want
to
be
helped
every
minute
in
the
day
and
i
ll
have
my
hands
full
i
suppose
i
m
lazy
and
selfish
but
i
do
hate
to
take
that
girl
s
on
my
i
don
t
blame
you
altogether
patty
and
gilbert
hepworth
smiled
at
her
gravely
yet
kindly
but
don
t
you
exaggerate
a
little
bit
i
know
what
you
mean
i
saw
last
night
what
insistent
ways
miss
galbraith
has
and
i
know
her
demands
on
your
time
and
attention
would
be
incessant
but
patty
think
how
much
you
have
only
worldly
goods
but
love
and
care
and
protection
and
interested
sympathy
isn
t
it
your
duty
to
do
what
you
can
for
this
strange
girl
thrown
so
definitely
in
your
way
she
in
my
way
said
patty
pouting
very
much
so
and
do
you
realise
went
on
hepworth
very
seriously
now
that
just
because
of
all
this
love
and
praise
and
appreciation
you
receive
you
run
a
pretty
strong
chance
of
becoming
selfish
and
mr
hepworth
i
do
believe
you
are
lecturing
me
that
s
exactly
what
i
m
doing
i
ve
done
it
before
and
never
has
it
failed
to
produce
a
good
effect
i
m
very
fond
of
you
patty
as
you
know
perfectly
well
and
i
can
not
bear
to
see
your
sunny
and
generous
nature
spoiled
by
indolence
or
thoughtlessness
on
your
part
now
i
m
going
to
drop
this
lecture
right
straight
now
i
ve
said
all
that
is
necessary
and
i
know
it
has
sunk
in
your
heart
deeply
as
i
intended
it
to
and
i
know
that
you
will
overcome
your
dislike
and
disinclination
for
the
work
but
that
you
will
honestly
and
definitely
try
to
do
all
you
can
for
that
girl
and
be
all
you
can
to
for
a
moment
patty
was
silent
and
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
are
right
hepworth
as
you
always
are
i
understand
all
you
have
said
and
all
you
have
meant
and
i
make
you
no
promises
but
i
promise
myself
to
do
all
i
can
for
mona
galbraith
to
help
her
in
the
way
she
needs
that
s
my
little
trump
exclaimed
hepworth
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
a
thrill
of
real
emotion
and
then
he
quickly
changed
the
subject
and
called
patty
s
attention
to
a
picturesque
bit
of
landscape
in
the
middle
distance
the
rest
of
their
ride
they
chatted
in
a
lighter
key
with
no
reference
to
duty
and
when
they
reached
the
country
club
they
were
both
laughing
merrily
as
they
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
i
m
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
cried
patty
springing
from
her
car
i
wish
i
d
brought
hepworth
s
luncheon
basket
well
filled
along
with
you
ll
have
luncheon
enough
puss
said
her
father
and
as
we
re
a
little
later
than
i
expected
we
ll
have
it
served
right
the
country
club
house
was
an
elaborate
one
with
broad
verandas
and
large
halls
and
rooms
the
walls
bore
the
usual
decorations
of
antlers
and
other
trophies
of
the
chase
and
the
appointments
were
luxurious
and
comfortable
patty
had
never
been
to
just
such
a
place
before
and
was
interested
in
it
all
can
t
we
become
members
father
she
asked
as
its
plan
and
scope
were
explained
to
her
next
year
perhaps
my
dear
but
this
summer
we
ll
content
ourselves
with
coming
over
here
occasionally
by
the
courtesy
of
my
luncheon
was
served
in
a
small
which
they
had
quite
to
themselves
the
viands
were
most
attractive
and
proved
more
than
acceptable
to
the
hungry
motorists
after
luncheon
they
wandered
about
the
beautiful
grounds
and
some
of
them
went
for
a
row
on
the
lake
while
some
others
had
a
short
game
of
tennis
patty
had
such
a
good
time
that
she
was
sorry
when
her
father
called
them
to
go
home
we
just
fly
from
one
kind
of
fun
to
another
exclaimed
elise
as
they
made
ready
to
start
mayn
t
i
ride
home
with
you
patty
no
no
miss
farrington
said
philip
van
reypen
overhearing
her
it
s
my
turn
to
ride
with
miss
fairfield
we
re
going
to
put
you
and
harper
in
the
roadster
with
hepworth
behind
to
see
that
you
don
t
fall
as
usual
van
reypen
s
audacity
carried
the
day
and
too
elise
had
no
objections
to
driving
home
with
kenneth
this
left
roger
and
christine
to
go
in
the
big
car
with
the
two
elder
fairfields
and
the
arrangement
was
fairly
satisfactory
all
around
but
as
patty
and
van
reypen
were
about
to
start
roger
came
up
to
speak
to
them
you
must
play
fair
and
square
patty
he
said
you
divvied
up
the
ride
coming
over
and
you
must
do
the
same
going
back
you
take
van
reypen
as
far
as
that
halfway
place
and
then
you
ve
got
to
exchange
him
for
all
right
roger
i
will
it
s
only
fair
that
all
you
boys
should
have
a
spin
with
camilla
in
oh
i
don
t
know
said
philip
van
reypen
as
they
sped
away
i
don
t
think
you
need
to
change
partners
on
this
short
deed
i
will
declared
patty
i
ve
had
enough
of
being
scolded
because
i
don
t
play
fair
now
when
we
get
to
that
halfway
place
you
know
where
i
mean
that
house
with
the
vines
all
over
it
i
m
going
to
put
you
out
and
take
roger
all
right
said
philip
humbly
but
you
won
t
do
it
until
we
do
reach
the
old
house
will
you
no
i
won
t
agreed
patty
after
a
while
philip
asked
that
he
be
allowed
to
drive
and
as
patty
was
quite
willing
to
be
an
idle
passenger
they
changed
seats
i
m
sorry
that
i
have
to
call
you
miss
fairfield
said
philip
resignedly
as
they
were
once
more
spinning
along
it
s
so
formal
it
takes
away
all
the
pleasure
of
our
too
bad
said
patty
demurely
but
do
you
know
i
rather
like
formality
van
i
m
glad
you
do
miss
fairfield
it
s
a
charming
day
isn
t
it
yes
van
reypen
delightful
returned
patty
and
then
the
conversation
lagged
i
want
to
tell
you
something
said
patty
suddenly
i
don
t
feel
quite
honest
and
i
want
to
fess
what
is
it
miss
fairfield
why
it
s
just
this
you
know
this
morning
when
kenneth
delayed
you
and
you
lost
our
race
well
i
asked
him
to
delay
you
on
you
did
you
little
rascal
why
that
was
downright
dishonesty
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
yes
i
am
said
patty
hanging
her
head
and
looking
like
a
lovely
penitent
can
you
ever
forgive
me
no
i
never
can
van
reypen
s
tone
was
very
stern
and
patty
was
amazed
at
the
serious
way
he
took
what
she
thought
was
a
joke
oh
truly
can
t
you
forgive
me
no
i
shall
and
he
glared
into
patty
s
upturned
face
with
an
expression
so
savage
that
it
suddenly
dawned
on
patty
that
he
was
fooling
after
all
with
a
beseeching
glance
and
a
drooping
curve
to
her
lips
patty
then
murmured
in
low
tones
can
t
you
ever
forgive
me
patty
of
course
i
can
and
there
s
nothing
to
forgive
you
little
rogue
but
now
you
re
going
to
call
me
philip
all
the
time
aren
t
you
i
thpothe
i
am
said
patty
foolishly
and
in
an
idiotic
tone
and
then
they
both
giggled
and
now
can
you
be
entertaining
asked
patty
briskly
and
not
just
sit
up
and
remark
that
it
is
a
charming
day
but
the
day
is
more
charming
than
ever
declared
philip
and
i
must
emphasise
the
but
goodness
gracious
me
wherever
is
that
halfway
place
have
we
passed
the
old
house
with
vines
clambering
all
over
it
no
we
haven
t
passed
it
yet
said
philip
innocently
we
ought
to
reach
it
soon
m
sure
it
s
how
complimentary
you
are
does
the
way
seem
so
long
it
doesn
t
seem
so
long
but
it
seems
strange
i
don
t
remember
these
houses
did
we
pass
them
on
the
way
over
you
must
have
been
so
busy
driving
the
car
you
didn
t
see
nonsense
i
ve
never
been
this
way
before
in
my
life
you
ve
taken
the
wrong
road
and
you
ve
done
it
on
purpose
so
i
have
patty
at
least
it
s
a
different
road
but
it
isn
t
a
wrong
road
it
s
just
as
direct
to
the
pebbles
as
the
other
road
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
not
passing
by
the
clambering
house
with
the
vines
oh
you
ve
done
it
so
we
d
slip
roger
of
course
i
did
clever
of
me
wasn
t
it
oh
you
haven
t
the
entire
monopoly
of
clever
ideas
if
you
mend
your
motor
car
with
chocolate
philip
was
gleefully
chuckling
at
his
successful
ruse
and
when
patty
realised
that
she
couldn
t
help
herself
she
laughed
too
roger
won
t
mind
anyway
she
said
he
s
such
a
old
duck
and
i
ll
make
it
up
to
him
by
taking
him
out
for
the
whole
day
on
a
picnic
with
my
new
lunch
basket
i
ve
been
wanting
to
try
that
lovely
basket
and
see
if
it
will
carry
a
picnic
for
philip
s
face
suddenly
lost
its
jovial
smile
there
ll
a
picnic
for
two
if
you
cut
up
any
such
trick
as
that
and
you
and
young
farrington
will
see
what
kind
of
a
picnic
i
mean
why
patty
you
re
hostess
of
this
house
party
of
yours
you
can
t
desert
all
your
other
guests
go
skylarking
off
with
only
one
of
unless
it
s
you
said
patty
with
a
demure
glance
at
him
yes
unless
it
s
me
said
philip
smiling
broadly
chapter
xvii
a
dinner
and
a
dance
when
patty
and
philip
reached
home
a
little
later
than
the
others
roger
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
where
s
roger
asked
patty
as
she
jumped
out
of
the
car
for
she
wanted
to
make
peace
with
him
at
once
he
s
gone
over
to
red
chimneys
said
elise
laughing
he
s
taken
a
terrible
fancy
to
that
galbraith
i
told
you
we
needn
t
mind
about
roger
said
patty
to
philip
i
m
glad
he
does
like
mona
though
i
confess
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
very
soon
roger
came
back
to
the
pebbles
bringing
mona
with
him
hello
people
the
girl
called
out
as
she
neared
the
veranda
you
kept
terribly
sly
about
your
birthday
didn
t
you
patty
but
farrington
told
me
last
night
and
father
telegraphed
to
new
york
for
a
present
for
me
to
give
you
and
it
s
just
arrived
by
special
messenger
how
do
you
like
it
and
mona
tossed
a
small
box
into
patty
s
lap
the
others
crowded
round
to
see
and
patty
opened
the
box
to
find
a
beautiful
jewel
pendant
hung
on
a
slender
thread
of
a
platinum
the
pendant
was
a
sapphire
surrounded
by
tiny
diamonds
and
was
of
fine
design
and
workmanship
mona
how
lovely
cried
patty
but
i
can
t
accept
such
a
valuable
present
from
nonsense
it
s
a
mere
trinket
i
m
delighted
to
give
it
to
you
and
father
was
delighted
to
get
it
for
me
so
you
ll
simply
have
to
take
it
i
was
only
afraid
you
wouldn
t
think
it
pretty
pretty
why
it
s
perfectly
beautiful
and
patty
clasped
the
chain
around
her
neck
at
once
she
was
a
little
uncertain
how
to
take
the
gift
but
she
could
not
so
hurt
mona
s
feelings
as
to
refuse
it
and
if
she
accepted
it
she
might
as
well
do
it
gracefully
she
cast
an
enquiring
glance
at
nan
who
as
usual
came
to
her
aid
it
s
a
lovely
present
patty
and
mona
is
most
kind
and
generous
to
give
it
to
you
i
m
sure
we
all
appreciate
thus
tacitly
advised
patty
thanked
mona
prettily
and
then
nan
declared
it
was
time
to
think
about
dressing
for
dinner
you
re
coming
mona
aren
t
you
said
patty
for
she
knew
nan
had
invited
her
oh
yes
indeed
i
ll
be
the
first
one
here
and
the
last
one
to
leave
trust
me
for
that
and
with
a
merry
laugh
mona
ran
away
across
the
two
lawns
to
her
own
house
she
s
all
right
said
roger
looking
after
her
yes
she
is
said
patty
generously
and
indeed
mona
had
risen
in
her
estimation
since
roger
showed
such
approval
of
her
and
then
the
group
separated
to
meet
again
at
the
birthday
dinner
the
three
girls
gathered
in
patty
s
room
for
a
short
chat
first
what
are
you
going
to
wear
patty
asked
elise
oh
i
have
a
new
blue
affair
that
s
perfectly
dear
what
s
yours
christine
white
said
christine
simply
i
can
t
wear
many
you
don
t
need
to
you
angel
person
said
patty
kissing
her
you
ll
look
heavenly
in
white
i
ve
never
seen
you
in
evening
dress
it
is
evening
dress
isn
t
it
christine
yes
that
is
it
s
a
round
neck
but
it
s
very
you
re
simple
yourself
said
patty
simply
sweet
isn
t
she
elise
it
was
patty
s
delight
to
make
elise
admire
christine
and
of
course
it
wasn
t
possible
when
thus
appealed
to
for
elise
to
do
anything
but
acquiesce
in
patty
s
opinion
and
now
honey
what
s
your
gorgeous
creation
that
s
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
country
people
down
here
said
patty
mine
is
green
returned
elise
and
it
s
a
good
enough
frock
but
i
know
it
won
t
be
in
it
with
yours
nonsense
it
s
probably
far
handsomer
aren
t
we
all
getting
to
have
dinner
parties
and
gowns
though
mine
isn
t
exactly
low
neck
it
s
just
cut
out
sort
of
yes
a
dutch
neck
said
elise
that
s
what
mine
but
still
it
does
seem
went
on
patty
musingly
to
have
a
birthday
dinner
and
dance
instead
of
just
an
ordinary
well
you
are
when
you
re
nineteen
said
christine
i
m
twenty
and
i
think
i
m
that
s
because
you
re
southern
said
patty
we
stay
little
girls
a
lot
longer
up
here
and
i
m
glad
of
it
for
i
hate
being
i
wish
i
could
wear
and
hair
ribbons
anyway
i
m
not
going
to
act
my
party
s
going
to
be
a
frolic
not
a
formal
how
many
are
coming
asked
christine
who
had
not
entirely
overcome
her
shyness
with
strangers
well
there
s
about
ten
of
our
own
crowd
and
nan
has
invited
about
ten
more
of
the
spring
beach
people
the
two
sayre
girls
are
awfully
jolly
you
ll
like
them
and
jack
pennington
is
a
dear
boy
and
so
is
guy
martin
and
then
there
s
dorothy
dennison
and
her
brother
phyllis
norton
quite
a
bunch
of
them
and
christine
don
t
you
go
cutting
up
any
of
your
shrinking
violet
tricks
i
want
you
to
be
the
belle
of
the
ball
elise
looked
up
in
surprise
but
seeing
the
determined
expression
on
patty
s
face
she
said
nothing
and
if
she
had
her
own
opinion
as
to
who
should
be
belle
of
the
ball
she
expressed
it
only
to
herself
an
hour
later
the
three
girls
went
downstairs
together
patty
in
the
middle
with
her
chiffon
frock
was
looking
her
best
the
pale
blue
suited
her
golden
hair
and
pink
cheeks
and
the
neck
was
exceedingly
becoming
to
her
rounded
throat
and
chin
elise
s
green
dress
was
far
more
elaborate
but
her
brilliant
beauty
seemed
to
call
for
an
ornate
setting
christine
s
gown
was
perhaps
the
prettiest
of
all
of
white
it
hung
in
soft
straight
folds
and
around
the
throat
was
a
delicate
pearl
embroidery
a
girdle
of
with
long
ends
gave
a
finishing
touch
and
on
christine
s
willowy
figure
and
with
her
madonna
face
the
gown
was
appropriate
and
effective
the
boys
who
were
waiting
in
the
hall
exclaimed
in
vociferous
compliment
as
the
girls
came
slowly
down
the
staircase
and
declared
that
such
a
trio
of
beauty
had
never
before
been
seen
nonsense
cried
patty
don
t
you
talk
to
us
as
if
we
were
young
ladies
we
re
only
a
little
bit
more
than
schoolgirls
just
because
i
m
nineteen
i
m
not
going
to
be
treated
with
dignity
roger
will
you
dance
the
first
dance
with
me
roger
looked
embarrassed
and
though
he
tried
to
speak
he
hesitated
and
stammered
why
patty
is
d
be
only
too
delighted
but
you
ve
already
asked
mona
cried
patty
with
a
teasing
laugh
i
knew
it
perfectly
well
roger
and
i
only
asked
you
to
tease
you
and
i
ll
be
perfectly
content
with
the
second
so
save
that
for
indeed
i
will
and
thank
you
kindly
said
roger
and
then
philip
van
reypen
and
kenneth
both
said
at
once
may
i
have
the
first
dance
patty
no
indeed
she
returned
laughing
gaily
at
them
i
m
not
going
to
give
my
first
dance
to
any
of
my
house
party
there
are
several
spring
beach
boys
coming
and
i
shall
dance
with
whichever
one
of
those
asks
me
patty
s
own
particular
decided
wag
of
the
head
accompanied
this
speech
and
the
men
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
coax
her
and
then
the
other
guests
began
to
arrive
and
the
great
entrance
hall
of
the
pebbles
was
a
scene
of
merry
laughter
and
chatter
and
greetings
and
introductions
on
all
sides
under
nan
s
orders
the
whole
place
had
been
beautifully
decorated
in
the
hall
and
rooms
were
garlands
and
banks
of
flowers
and
tall
palms
shading
alcoved
nooks
the
verandas
were
hung
with
japanese
lanterns
and
a
few
of
these
were
scattered
among
the
shrubbery
to
light
the
way
for
any
who
might
be
inclined
to
stroll
on
the
lawn
at
eight
o
clock
patty
taking
her
father
s
arm
led
the
way
to
the
nan
and
hepworth
followed
and
then
the
others
in
merry
procession
dinner
was
served
at
small
tables
as
the
number
of
guests
was
too
large
to
be
accommodated
at
one
each
table
was
beautifully
decorated
with
flowers
and
candles
and
pretty
as
souvenirs
of
the
occasion
of
course
there
was
a
birthday
cake
and
when
at
last
patty
cut
it
and
each
guest
had
partaken
of
it
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
dance
about
to
begin
several
musicians
were
on
the
broad
landing
halfway
upstairs
and
played
just
the
right
kind
of
music
for
young
people
s
merry
dancing
jack
pennington
asked
patty
for
the
first
dance
and
a
little
to
his
surprise
she
graciously
granted
it
he
had
hardly
hoped
for
this
honour
but
he
didn
t
know
that
patty
had
planned
it
thus
in
order
to
avoid
selecting
one
of
her
house
party
in
preference
to
the
others
so
she
danced
with
jack
pennington
and
afterward
as
they
sauntered
out
on
the
veranda
all
the
other
men
clustered
around
patty
begging
for
dances
until
her
programme
was
full
and
many
of
the
dances
had
been
divided
of
course
as
patty
was
hostess
she
would
naturally
receive
much
attention
but
her
own
merry
and
charming
personality
made
her
easily
the
most
popular
girl
present
though
the
others
were
almost
equally
so
handsome
elise
was
a
general
favourite
and
christine
s
delicate
southern
beauty
attracted
many
admirers
mona
was
resplendent
in
bright
pink
silk
elaborately
ornamented
she
wore
too
many
jewels
as
always
but
her
gaiety
and
her
hearty
enjoyment
of
the
occasion
made
her
attractive
to
many
after
a
dance
with
philip
patty
and
he
wandered
out
on
to
the
veranda
and
sat
for
a
moment
on
the
railing
beautiful
show
patty
he
said
one
of
the
prettiest
parties
i
ever
saw
these
lanterns
are
gorgeous
why
don
t
you
keep
them
here
all
the
time
sets
off
the
house
wonderfully
come
down
on
the
lawn
for
a
little
i
m
afraid
you
ll
kidnap
me
said
patty
mischievously
no
honest
i
won
t
though
i
d
like
to
say
let
s
get
camilla
out
and
go
for
a
little
spin
will
you
indeed
i
won
t
we
got
out
of
that
other
scrape
pretty
well
but
i
m
not
going
to
take
any
chances
again
beside
the
next
dance
is
kenneth
s
i
d
better
get
back
where
he
can
find
oh
he
ll
hunt
you
up
all
right
hello
who
s
this
some
one
came
running
toward
them
through
the
it
was
mona
out
of
breath
and
laughing
hide
me
she
cried
hide
me
i
m
running
away
from
roger
how
extraordinary
laughed
patty
you
a
coquettish
young
thing
aren
t
you
mona
hide
me
patty
urged
mona
that
s
a
dear
let
me
get
behind
you
mona
slipped
around
behind
patty
and
philip
but
anxious
to
help
her
patty
said
back
into
the
arbour
mona
we
ll
keep
in
front
of
you
hurry
here
comes
have
you
seen
miss
galbraith
asked
roger
coming
up
to
them
entirely
unsuspicious
of
mona
s
whereabouts
we
ve
just
strolled
out
here
said
patty
innocently
why
don
t
you
look
on
the
veranda
roger
does
she
know
you
re
looking
for
her
of
course
she
does
on
the
veranda
you
say
and
roger
was
off
like
a
shot
patty
and
philip
stifling
with
laughter
turned
back
to
mona
who
stood
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
cautioning
silence
and
as
in
obedience
to
her
gesture
they
were
still
they
all
distinctly
heard
a
voice
speaking
on
the
other
side
of
the
arbour
the
speaker
could
not
be
seen
and
the
hearers
had
no
intention
of
eavesdropping
but
it
was
kenneth
s
voice
and
his
tone
was
tense
and
angry
i
tell
you
elise
he
said
i
don
t
believe
patty
ever
said
that
she
did
said
elise
with
the
accent
of
one
who
reiterates
it
was
philip
van
reypen
s
impulse
to
walk
round
the
arbour
at
once
and
make
their
presence
known
but
patty
silently
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
led
him
toward
the
house
mona
followed
also
silently
for
she
realised
at
once
that
patty
was
disturbed
at
what
she
had
heard
the
words
in
themselves
might
mean
a
mere
trifle
or
nothing
at
all
but
the
seriousness
of
kenneth
s
voice
and
the
petulant
insistence
of
elise
seemed
to
forebode
trouble
what
does
it
mean
whispered
philip
as
they
neared
the
house
nothing
at
all
said
patty
but
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
her
lip
was
quivering
she
had
divined
intuitively
that
elise
had
told
kenneth
something
to
make
him
angry
and
she
felt
sure
that
elise
had
done
it
purposely
and
that
she
had
misrepresented
the
facts
shall
i
take
you
into
the
house
asked
philip
gently
i
think
you
said
your
next
dance
is
harper
not
just
yet
said
patty
who
was
so
hurt
by
elise
s
treachery
that
she
could
not
fully
control
her
quivering
lip
and
the
tears
that
came
to
her
eyes
mona
had
disappeared
and
so
philip
said
let
us
stroll
once
more
round
the
drive
and
then
it
will
be
all
his
voice
was
so
pleasant
and
his
manner
so
quiet
that
it
acted
as
a
balm
to
patty
s
shattered
nerves
and
she
looked
up
gratefully
and
smiled
at
him
through
two
teardrops
that
trembled
in
her
blue
eyes
you
re
awfully
good
she
said
and
i
m
not
going
to
be
silly
never
mind
it
but
aren
t
you
engaged
for
this
dance
yes
to
miss
galbraith
he
replied
smiling
but
i
feel
quite
sure
she
has
forgotten
it
in
her
game
of
with
young
but
you
must
go
and
find
her
all
the
same
said
patty
suddenly
mindful
of
etiquette
come
let
us
hurry
to
the
house
i
m
all
right
they
quickened
their
pace
and
philip
talked
with
a
cheery
banter
so
that
when
they
reached
the
veranda
patty
was
her
own
smiling
merry
self
and
she
felt
profoundly
grateful
to
philip
because
he
had
not
again
referred
to
the
bit
of
conversation
they
had
overheard
chapter
xviii
mona
interferes
patty
found
kenneth
in
the
doorway
awaiting
her
here
you
are
he
called
out
cheerily
enough
and
patty
hoped
it
was
only
her
imagination
that
made
her
think
his
manner
a
little
constrained
he
was
gentle
and
kindly
as
ever
but
he
was
not
in
merry
mood
and
patty
felt
this
at
once
they
began
to
dance
their
steps
suited
perfectly
and
though
patty
herself
was
such
an
accomplished
dancer
that
she
could
adapt
her
step
to
any
one
yet
she
always
specially
enjoyed
a
turn
with
kenneth
but
now
he
seemed
different
and
though
he
danced
as
perfectly
as
usual
and
so
did
patty
there
was
a
certain
constraint
in
his
manner
and
he
spoke
only
occasionally
and
then
the
merest
commonplaces
patty
realised
fully
that
there
was
something
wrong
but
she
also
knew
she
could
do
nothing
then
and
there
to
set
it
right
she
couldn
t
ask
kenneth
what
elise
had
said
to
him
and
she
couldn
t
think
of
any
other
way
to
open
the
subject
so
after
a
few
turns
round
the
room
she
was
really
glad
that
another
partner
claimed
her
for
this
was
one
of
the
dances
that
she
had
divided
kenneth
left
her
with
a
simple
thank
you
patty
and
turning
on
his
heel
went
out
of
the
in
the
hall
he
met
mona
who
said
abruptly
and
impulsively
oh
harper
i
haven
t
any
partner
for
this
dance
come
for
a
walk
round
the
lawn
won
t
you
wouldn
t
you
rather
dance
asked
kenneth
who
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
no
said
mona
smiling
wilfully
i
want
to
walk
out
under
the
lanterns
on
the
lawn
they
re
so
lovely
and
mona
had
a
wheedling
way
with
her
and
kenneth
smiled
a
little
as
he
escorted
her
down
the
steps
and
along
a
side
path
through
the
grounds
you
think
i
m
a
queer
girl
don
t
you
harper
she
began
as
they
strolled
along
under
the
trees
if
i
did
you
couldn
t
expect
me
to
tell
you
so
miss
galbraith
he
parried
well
even
if
you
haven
t
thought
so
before
you
will
now
and
mona
gave
a
determined
shake
of
her
head
but
i
don
t
care
if
you
do
i
want
you
to
answer
me
a
question
what
did
miss
farrington
tell
you
that
patty
fairfield
had
said
and
you
returned
that
you
didn
t
believe
patty
said
it
now
kenneth
was
an
exceedingly
young
man
but
he
was
certainly
taken
aback
by
this
question
flung
at
him
so
suddenly
by
a
comparative
stranger
and
he
was
tempted
to
reply
so
plainly
that
she
must
think
him
rude
but
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
modified
his
intentions
and
only
said
i
m
sorry
to
have
you
think
queer
miss
galbraith
but
even
at
that
risk
i
must
decline
to
answer
such
a
very
personal
question
and
and
too
repeated
mona
stopping
and
turning
to
look
squarely
at
him
you
were
going
to
say
that
i
m
an
eavesdropper
and
except
for
your
inability
to
be
so
rude
you
would
tell
me
kenneth
was
amazed
at
the
girl
s
intuition
but
he
said
honestly
you
are
very
nearly
right
miss
very
nearly
right
i
m
exactly
right
and
you
know
it
now
let
me
tell
you
kenneth
harper
i
don
t
care
one
for
your
opinion
of
me
and
you
may
think
just
exactly
what
you
choose
but
i
have
another
s
interest
at
heart
and
i
m
perfectly
justified
in
asking
you
the
question
i
did
ask
please
tell
at
the
last
words
mona
s
voice
sank
to
a
pleading
whisper
and
there
was
such
heartfelt
urgency
in
her
voice
that
he
was
moved
against
his
will
why
do
you
want
to
know
miss
galbraith
he
asked
more
gently
they
were
walking
on
again
now
and
mona
looked
straight
before
her
as
she
replied
i
can
not
tell
you
that
but
i
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
what
i
ask
was
it
anything
about
me
mona
had
no
idea
that
it
was
and
this
was
a
purely
strategic
enquiry
no
it
was
not
about
you
now
i
hope
you
re
no
i
m
not
satisfied
was
it
about
you
yes
it
and
was
it
something
mean
patty
had
said
about
you
yes
it
mr
harper
you
are
not
a
true
friend
you
know
patty
fairfield
couldn
t
say
a
mean
thing
to
save
her
life
and
especially
about
you
one
of
her
best
friends
oh
i
don
t
think
i
m
that
said
kenneth
in
a
cynical
tone
you
are
too
now
are
you
sure
patty
said
this
thing
elise
said
so
muttered
kenneth
who
had
forgotten
he
was
talking
to
a
stranger
because
mona
had
assumed
such
compelling
intimacy
and
are
you
sure
it
was
mean
well
rather
you
can
judge
for
yourself
kenneth
s
indignation
got
the
better
of
his
and
he
told
mona
frankly
the
truth
once
when
patty
went
away
i
gave
her
a
little
locket
as
a
parting
gift
and
she
thanked
me
and
said
she
liked
it
now
elise
tells
me
that
patty
told
her
she
didn
t
care
a
snap
about
that
locket
and
she
only
wore
it
once
or
and
you
told
miss
farrington
that
you
didn
t
believe
patty
said
that
yes
but
elise
insisted
that
she
did
say
it
and
somehow
i
believe
elise
her
words
had
the
ring
of
thank
you
harper
for
your
confidence
mona
spoke
very
earnestly
believe
me
you
have
done
no
harm
in
telling
me
this
you
think
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
it
is
you
think
me
a
queer
girl
and
i
am
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
patty
fairfield
is
a
true
sweet
loyal
nature
sound
to
the
core
and
elise
farrington
is
not
above
a
trifling
deception
now
and
then
if
she
wishes
to
gain
a
point
please
take
me
back
to
the
they
walked
the
short
distance
in
silence
kenneth
secretly
thinking
that
miss
galbraith
was
certainly
queer
and
at
the
same
time
wondering
if
elise
could
have
made
up
that
story
but
as
he
had
said
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
elise
s
voice
as
she
repeated
patty
s
words
that
convinced
him
they
were
true
with
a
sigh
he
went
up
the
steps
by
miss
galbraith
s
side
and
then
they
separated
to
join
other
partners
the
dance
went
on
with
its
merriment
and
gaiety
and
of
course
no
one
would
have
known
that
either
patty
or
kenneth
had
a
troubled
mind
elise
was
in
specially
gay
spirits
and
mona
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
thoroughly
it
was
a
lovely
party
declared
elise
after
it
was
over
and
the
last
guest
gone
it
was
just
perfect
there
wasn
t
a
flaw
isn
t
that
so
patty
i
had
a
good
time
said
patty
a
little
wearily
but
i
m
awfully
tired
and
i
m
going
right
straight
to
bed
everybody
roger
she
nodded
pleasantly
to
the
young
men
and
started
up
the
stairs
at
once
elise
and
christine
followed
and
when
they
reached
the
upper
hall
patty
bade
them
a
brief
but
pleasant
and
went
straight
to
her
own
room
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
took
off
her
pretty
blue
frock
i
can
t
let
the
matter
go
without
saying
a
word
i
can
t
say
anything
because
that
would
put
elise
in
the
wrong
and
she
is
my
guest
i
ll
just
have
to
live
it
down
i
but
it
wasn
t
so
easily
lived
down
the
next
morning
though
patty
tried
to
be
especially
cordial
to
kenneth
he
avoided
her
whenever
possible
not
noticeably
to
the
others
patty
realised
that
he
did
not
seek
her
company
or
sit
by
her
on
the
veranda
or
ask
to
ride
with
her
in
the
motor
the
morning
dragged
along
nobody
seeming
to
have
energy
enough
to
propose
any
sort
of
fun
patty
s
birthday
seems
to
have
been
too
much
for
this
crowd
said
nan
laughingly
i
propose
that
you
men
all
go
for
a
swim
and
let
these
exhausted
girlies
take
a
little
nap
i
think
they
danced
too
late
and
i
sha
n
t
allow
such
dissipation
i
feel
fine
fairfield
declared
elise
i
never
get
tired
dancing
do
you
christine
no
i
didn
t
get
tired
thought
it
was
a
lovely
party
i
very
seldom
have
an
opportunity
to
be
in
such
but
you
re
tired
aren
t
you
patty
asked
elise
as
patty
sat
on
the
veranda
rail
leaning
listlessly
against
a
pillar
before
she
had
time
to
answer
however
a
servant
came
walking
along
the
drive
whom
patty
recognised
as
one
of
the
red
chimneys
footmen
he
brought
a
note
which
he
handed
to
patty
and
then
with
a
deferential
bow
he
went
away
patty
asked
permission
to
read
the
note
glanced
it
over
and
then
tossed
it
to
roger
saying
we
seem
to
be
especially
favoured
the
note
was
an
invitation
for
patty
and
roger
to
come
over
to
red
chimneys
at
once
but
no
one
else
was
asked
come
on
patty
said
roger
the
others
will
excuse
us
for
a
little
while
i
m
so
patty
and
roger
walked
away
by
the
shortcut
across
the
two
lawns
and
found
mona
in
the
doorway
awaiting
them
she
smiled
as
she
put
her
arm
around
patty
and
said
you
re
the
one
i
want
asked
farrington
for
a
well
i
like
that
exclaimed
roger
looking
incredulous
well
i
ll
tell
you
went
on
mona
smiling
at
him
the
truth
is
i
want
to
see
patty
privately
on
a
important
matter
i
didn
t
want
to
send
for
her
alone
because
it
looked
so
conspicuous
but
our
private
conference
won
t
last
more
than
ten
minutes
and
if
you
can
entertain
yourself
that
long
i
ll
take
care
of
you
afterward
here
s
the
morning
paper
and
do
try
to
be
mona
didn
t
wait
for
roger
s
response
but
with
her
arm
still
around
patty
led
her
to
the
library
took
her
in
and
closed
the
door
patty
she
began
i
m
a
queer
girl
and
you
know
it
i
know
it
you
don
t
like
me
very
much
but
i
like
you
and
i
d
do
anything
for
good
gracious
mona
what
you
getting
at
i
ll
tell
you
exactly
what
i
m
getting
at
i
ll
tell
you
right
now
i
may
be
queer
but
i
can
see
a
hole
through
a
millstone
when
anybody
i
love
is
concerned
now
you
know
when
you
and
van
reypen
and
i
were
in
the
little
arbour
last
night
we
overheard
somebody
talking
on
the
other
side
of
the
thick
really
mona
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
go
too
far
or
i
may
lose
my
temper
oh
no
you
won
t
patty
fairfield
you
just
sit
still
and
listen
now
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
we
weren
t
eavesdropping
of
us
we
all
heard
what
harper
said
to
miss
well
what
of
it
patty
s
face
was
pale
and
her
lips
were
set
hard
together
she
was
thoroughly
angry
at
what
she
considered
mona
s
unwarrantable
interference
and
she
felt
she
could
stand
but
little
more
just
this
of
it
i
asked
harper
what
it
was
that
miss
farrington
told
him
about
mona
galbraith
you
didn
t
i
certainly
did
and
what
s
more
he
told
kenneth
told
you
said
patty
incredulously
yes
he
did
and
this
was
it
but
perhaps
you
don
t
want
to
know
what
it
of
course
i
do
mona
tell
me
quick
well
he
said
that
miss
farrington
told
him
that
you
didn
t
care
a
snap
about
the
locket
he
gave
you
and
that
you
only
wore
it
once
or
what
exclaimed
patty
i
don
t
quite
understand
the
locket
kenneth
gave
me
that
s
what
she
oh
for
goodness
sake
i
understand
now
that
locket
why
the
idea
say
mona
you
re
a
trump
to
find
this
all
out
you
didn
t
think
so
at
no
i
didn
t
and
i
m
sorry
you
have
played
the
part
of
a
real
friend
and
you
ve
done
more
for
me
than
you
realise
but
oh
mona
how
elise
do
a
thing
like
that
she
s
that
sort
that
s
all
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
she
likes
kenneth
harper
an
awful
lot
and
she
knows
that
he
likes
you
better
than
he
does
her
so
she
s
trying
to
set
him
against
set
kenneth
against
me
she
couldn
t
do
it
dear
old
ken
we
re
too
good
friends
for
that
but
mona
how
did
you
find
out
all
this
you
scarcely
know
these
oh
i
sized
up
that
farrington
girl
the
minute
i
saw
her
she
isn
t
a
bit
like
her
brother
he
s
an
good
sort
and
the
poor
chappie
is
still
out
there
reading
the
paper
he
must
be
devouring
the
advertisements
by
this
time
now
patty
forget
part
in
this
affair
skip
over
home
make
it
up
with
harper
and
do
whatever
you
think
best
with
that
farrington
i
can
t
do
anything
with
her
because
she
s
my
guest
but
i
can
make
it
up
with
ken
in
just
about
two
minutes
and
as
for
you
mona
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
oh
cut
it
out
i
d
do
heaps
more
than
that
for
you
if
i
only
had
the
chance
fly
now
for
you
must
know
how
impatient
i
am
to
go
and
talk
to
my
new
beau
so
after
an
embrace
that
was
hearty
enough
at
least
to
indicate
her
gratitude
patty
flew
chapter
xix
philip
s
picnic
on
patty
s
return
she
found
the
veranda
almost
deserted
christine
and
hepworth
elise
and
van
reypen
had
gone
down
to
the
beach
fairfield
had
gone
to
the
city
and
nan
was
chatting
with
kenneth
ducky
stepmother
of
mine
said
patty
as
she
wound
her
arm
around
nan
s
neck
if
you
don
t
want
to
monopolise
this
young
man
i
d
like
to
borrow
him
for
a
short
you
may
take
him
patty
said
nan
with
a
resigned
sigh
but
i
suppose
you
know
you
will
leave
me
alone
in
a
cold
world
your
father
has
gone
to
new
but
nan
you
ought
to
have
some
time
to
yourself
solitude
is
an
awfully
good
thing
once
in
a
while
don
t
you
sort
of
feel
the
need
of
it
now
yes
i
think
i
do
said
nan
laughing
so
you
may
have
kenneth
for
a
while
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
take
him
for
a
spin
said
patty
come
on
kenneth
hesitated
for
a
moment
don
t
you
want
to
go
spinning
with
patty
fairfield
he
said
no
thank
you
i
have
some
household
matters
to
attend
to
one
can
t
have
a
house
party
without
occasionally
having
an
eye
on
domestic
affairs
so
be
home
in
time
for
soon
patty
and
kenneth
were
flying
along
the
beach
road
and
the
swift
camilla
was
living
up
to
her
highest
reputation
patty
was
driving
and
kenneth
was
polite
and
amiable
but
not
merry
after
a
time
patty
slowed
down
speed
a
little
kenneth
she
said
abruptly
i
ve
something
to
say
to
you
and
i
m
going
to
say
it
right
straight
out
you
know
what
elise
told
you
that
i
said
about
you
or
rather
about
the
locket
you
gave
me
yes
i
know
and
by
the
way
it
seems
that
just
about
everybody
else
knows
never
mind
that
said
patty
knowing
that
the
boy
was
annoyed
because
mona
had
interfered
in
the
matter
the
point
is
ken
that
what
elise
told
you
i
said
wasn
t
entirely
not
entirely
true
how
much
of
it
was
true
since
you
seem
to
know
all
about
her
conversation
with
me
i
suppose
she
told
no
she
didn
t
now
listen
ken
i
hate
awfully
to
talk
against
elise
but
i
ve
simply
got
to
stand
up
for
my
own
rights
in
this
thing
i
did
tell
her
that
i
only
wore
that
locket
once
or
twice
but
i
tell
her
that
i
didn
t
care
anything
about
it
for
i
do
i
care
a
great
deal
about
then
why
don
t
you
wear
it
oftener
i
ll
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
ken
it
s
just
because
that
locket
with
your
picture
in
it
was
too
too
personal
a
sort
of
present
for
you
to
give
me
or
for
me
to
you
took
it
yes
after
i
d
asked
father
and
he
told
me
i
might
but
you
know
i
went
away
with
elise
then
to
paris
and
every
time
she
saw
it
she
pretended
that
it
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
it
did
of
course
it
was
only
a
token
of
our
boy
and
girl
friendship
but
she
chose
to
pretend
it
meant
romance
and
sentiment
and
all
those
but
since
it
meant
and
still
means
our
boy
and
girl
friendship
i
think
you
might
wear
it
i
see
i
ll
have
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
well
last
christmas
elise
bought
a
seal
ring
for
roger
and
then
at
the
last
minute
she
decided
she
d
like
to
give
it
to
you
and
she
asked
my
advice
about
it
i
told
her
it
was
too
personal
a
present
for
a
girl
to
give
a
young
man
and
i
didn
t
think
she
ought
to
do
it
it
wasn
t
that
i
didn
t
want
her
to
give
you
a
nice
present
but
i
didn
t
think
it
looked
right
for
her
to
give
you
that
kind
of
a
one
i
told
her
to
get
you
books
or
something
like
what
s
all
this
got
to
do
with
the
locket
why
elise
said
that
i
needn
t
talk
about
personal
presents
after
i
had
accepted
from
you
a
locket
with
your
picture
in
it
and
so
i
told
her
that
that
was
very
different
as
we
were
old
friends
and
anyhow
i
had
only
worn
it
once
or
twice
but
i
didn
t
say
i
didn
t
care
anything
for
kenneth
s
face
cleared
and
he
turned
toward
patty
with
an
honest
beaming
smile
it
s
all
right
patty
i
see
through
it
now
elise
did
try
to
make
me
think
you
had
said
something
mean
but
you
didn
t
and
i
felt
sure
you
hadn
you
didn
t
feel
sure
no
i
m
ashamed
to
say
i
didn
t
at
first
but
that
was
because
i
was
so
hurt
at
what
i
was
told
you
had
said
but
it
s
all
right
now
and
i
know
you
ll
forgive
me
like
the
trump
you
are
i
d
grasp
your
strong
right
hand
if
i
weren
t
afraid
that
would
make
you
steer
us
both
into
the
i
ll
consider
it
grasped
and
i
m
downright
glad
that
we
re
good
chums
again
for
i
hate
to
have
squabbles
with
anybody
and
i
almost
never
i
know
it
patty
you
re
a
little
thing
and
i
was
a
coward
to
believe
for
a
minute
that
you
d
say
anything
unkind
about
any
of
your
especially
you
ken
and
patty
flashed
him
a
glance
of
comradeship
but
it
was
mona
who
fixed
this
thing
up
for
isn
t
she
a
queer
girl
she
s
so
blunt
and
yet
very
few
girls
could
have
done
what
she
did
for
you
i
know
it
and
i
do
appreciate
it
and
i
shall
always
love
her
for
it
but
ken
what
can
i
say
to
elise
don
t
say
anything
patty
that
s
the
best
and
if
she
ever
tries
again
to
lower
me
in
your
esteem
what
then
she
won
t
succeed
i
ve
had
my
little
good
for
you
ken
if
you
ever
have
reason
to
think
that
i
said
anything
mean
about
you
you
come
and
ask
me
about
it
mona
may
not
be
around
next
i
will
indeed
and
then
peace
being
thoroughly
established
the
trouble
passed
out
of
their
minds
forever
and
the
old
chummy
relations
were
resumed
they
had
a
beautiful
drive
along
the
coast
and
when
they
got
back
to
the
pebbles
it
was
nearly
lunch
time
they
found
the
whole
crowd
assembled
on
the
veranda
and
van
reypen
seemed
to
be
spokesman
at
a
very
important
conference
it
ll
be
the
most
fun
of
anything
you
ever
saw
he
declared
a
real
picnic
none
of
your
modern
affairs
but
a
tablecloth
spread
on
the
ground
and
sandwiches
and
devilled
eggs
and
a
campfire
to
boil
the
coffee
and
lemonade
and
hopping
in
the
pie
and
everything
just
as
it
should
be
oh
gorgeous
why
sit
on
the
ground
asked
christine
aren
t
there
any
benches
in
the
picnic
place
we
re
not
going
to
a
picnic
grounds
little
girl
van
reypen
informed
her
we
re
going
to
a
real
live
woods
to
the
darksome
depths
of
a
dingley
tell
us
all
about
it
cried
patty
as
she
and
kenneth
joined
the
group
entirely
my
own
invention
cried
philip
it
s
a
picnic
i
m
arranging
for
and
i
d
be
honoured
if
you
two
would
deign
to
we
will
that
exclaimed
patty
but
i
heard
something
about
grasshoppers
do
we
have
to
have
those
no
if
you
prefer
you
can
have
ants
or
spiders
but
you
can
t
have
a
real
picnic
without
some
such
attachments
now
listen
to
what
i
ve
planned
it
s
just
too
lovely
i
ve
engaged
three
runabouts
from
the
amiable
garage
man
over
forninst
camilla
will
make
four
and
if
and
fairfield
will
lead
the
parade
in
their
own
car
we
ll
have
an
imposing
not
i
cried
nan
gaily
if
you
young
people
want
to
go
on
this
entomological
picnic
i
ve
not
the
slightest
objection
and
i
ll
see
that
you
have
enough
sandwiches
and
devilled
eggs
to
feed
both
yourselves
and
the
grasshoppers
but
i
ll
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
my
husband
and
myself
from
the
only
regrets
i
ve
had
so
far
said
philip
anybody
else
who
don
t
want
to
go
but
the
others
all
declared
that
the
plan
was
perfect
and
they
wouldn
t
miss
the
picnic
for
anything
now
i
ll
run
the
whole
show
went
on
philip
you
understand
it
s
my
picnic
entirely
and
i
m
host
and
master
of
ceremonies
and
chief
engineer
i
shall
provide
the
entire
luncheon
and
with
due
respects
and
thanks
to
fairfield
for
her
offer
of
eggs
i
must
decline
it
as
i
shall
get
all
those
things
from
the
and
generously
proportioned
lady
who
is
queen
of
the
kitchen
over
at
my
they
all
professed
themselves
satisfied
to
let
van
reypen
take
full
charge
of
his
own
picnic
and
all
expressed
perfect
willingness
to
be
merely
passengers
mona
was
present
as
usual
and
was
of
course
included
in
the
invitation
she
was
enthusiastic
in
her
delight
at
the
prospect
and
quite
forgetting
to
go
home
to
luncheon
she
accepted
nan
s
invitation
to
lunch
at
the
the
next
day
proved
an
ideal
one
for
philip
s
picnic
they
were
to
start
about
ten
o
clock
for
he
informed
them
the
particular
dingley
dell
he
had
in
mind
was
a
fairly
long
distance
off
so
promptly
at
ten
o
clock
he
came
over
to
the
pebbles
in
a
runabout
accompanied
by
a
chauffeur
he
was
followed
by
two
other
runabouts
each
in
charge
of
a
chauffeur
the
picnic
party
stood
on
the
veranda
not
quite
sure
what
the
arrangements
were
to
be
but
laughingly
declaring
they
were
ready
to
follow
orders
first
said
van
reypen
i
ll
load
up
this
car
and
into
the
first
runabout
he
assisted
miss
galbraith
and
bade
roger
farrington
get
in
beside
her
needless
to
say
these
two
were
well
satisfied
and
went
spinning
off
down
the
road
next
turning
to
hepworth
he
asked
him
if
he
could
drive
a
car
an
electric
yes
said
hepworth
because
if
you
don
t
want
to
drive
it
this
car
will
hold
three
and
you
can
take
a
chauffeur
said
philip
who
had
provided
for
every
emergency
no
i
prefer
to
drive
said
hepworth
quietly
and
then
philip
said
all
right
and
i
give
you
miss
farley
for
a
companion
don
t
quarrel
on
the
and
so
with
christine
hepworth
drove
away
and
philip
turned
to
the
others
i
hardly
know
how
to
divide
up
the
rest
of
us
he
said
stroking
his
chin
thoughtfully
but
i
ll
try
it
this
way
harper
will
you
take
miss
farrington
in
this
very
new
runabout
it
was
an
awkward
situation
though
philip
didn
t
know
it
elise
was
delighted
with
the
plan
and
beamed
all
over
her
face
as
she
took
the
seat
indicated
kenneth
was
not
at
all
pleased
and
it
was
really
with
difficulty
that
he
refrained
from
showing
it
but
patty
gave
him
a
pleading
look
as
if
begging
him
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
and
so
with
what
was
apparently
hearty
he
took
his
seat
beside
elise
saying
all
right
here
goes
for
a
fine
ride
kenneth
was
fond
of
driving
a
car
and
not
owning
one
himself
he
rarely
had
the
opportunity
so
patty
felt
sure
he
would
enjoy
the
trip
quite
irrespective
of
who
might
be
beside
him
and
as
patty
realised
there
was
no
other
way
to
arrange
the
couples
from
van
reypen
s
viewpoint
for
she
knew
from
the
beginning
that
he
intended
to
ride
with
her
i
declare
i
m
a
car
short
exclaimed
philip
as
kenneth
and
elise
drove
away
i
should
have
ordered
four
cars
and
i
only
engaged
three
we
ll
have
to
stay
at
home
shall
you
mind
no
said
patty
mischievously
i
don
t
mind
i
ll
read
aloud
to
you
if
you
it
seems
too
bad
for
me
not
to
go
when
it
s
my
own
picnic
said
philip
musingly
you
don
t
happen
to
know
of
any
little
motor
car
we
could
use
do
you
we
might
take
camilla
suggested
patty
in
a
dubious
tone
just
the
thing
say
we
do
how
clever
of
you
to
think
of
that
and
as
patty
broke
into
peals
of
laughter
at
his
foolishness
philip
flew
down
the
steps
and
around
to
the
garage
returning
in
a
moment
with
camilla
which
miller
was
impatiently
holding
in
readiness
i
m
going
to
drive
philip
announced
calmly
all
right
i
don
t
care
but
then
you
must
let
me
drive
coming
home
i
declare
with
a
house
party
i
almost
never
get
a
chance
to
drive
my
own
car
never
mind
your
horrid
old
house
party
will
soon
be
going
and
then
you
can
drive
all
you
it
isn
t
a
horrid
old
house
party
it
s
a
lovely
sweet
delicious
house
party
and
i
wish
it
would
stay
forever
this
part
of
it
will
if
you
give
him
the
slightest
oh
i
don
t
want
part
of
it
unless
i
have
it
all
i
had
no
idea
house
parties
were
such
fun
i
think
we
re
having
beautiful
times
don
t
you
yes
since
you
ve
made
up
with
young
harper
and
philip
s
eyes
twinkled
why
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
patty
blushing
pink
how
did
you
know
anything
about
it
i
didn
t
and
i
don
t
and
i
don
t
want
to
but
when
i
see
my
little
hostess
going
around
with
a
sad
and
forlorn
expression
on
her
face
and
one
of
her
guests
looking
as
if
he
d
lost
his
last
friend
and
then
they
both
go
for
a
motor
ride
and
come
back
jubilantly
chummy
then
sherlock
it
out
that
they
ve
had
a
squabble
and
a
am
i
altogether
wrong
not
altogether
said
patty
demurely
chapter
xx
a
narrow
escape
the
picnic
was
the
real
thing
that
is
it
was
the
real
sort
of
a
picnic
and
it
was
therefore
a
novelty
to
most
of
its
participants
patty
had
been
on
many
motor
picnics
where
elaborate
luncheons
were
served
by
waiters
with
the
same
appointments
of
silver
glass
and
china
that
she
would
use
at
home
but
not
since
her
vernondale
days
had
she
attended
this
sort
of
picnic
there
were
no
servants
the
simple
but
appetising
luncheon
was
spread
on
a
tablecloth
laid
on
the
grass
and
true
to
tradition
a
grasshopper
now
and
then
leaped
in
among
the
viands
or
an
audacious
spider
attempted
to
approach
the
feast
but
these
were
few
and
easily
vanquished
by
the
brave
and
valiant
men
of
the
party
the
men
too
proved
themselves
capable
in
the
arts
of
and
so
that
patty
who
was
a
born
cook
and
loved
it
found
no
use
for
her
talent
so
she
and
the
other
girls
set
the
table
as
daintily
as
they
could
with
the
primitive
means
at
their
command
and
decorated
it
prettily
with
wild
flowers
as
a
rule
said
elise
as
she
sat
with
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
of
lemonade
in
the
other
i
like
silver
forks
and
china
plates
at
a
picnic
but
for
once
i
do
think
these
wooden
butter
plates
and
paper
napkins
are
rather
fun
what
do
you
think
patty
far
be
it
from
me
to
cast
reflections
on
the
goods
my
host
provides
but
generally
speaking
i
confess
i
like
my
table
a
few
feet
above
the
population
of
mother
oh
pshaw
patty
exclaimed
philip
you
re
no
kind
of
a
sport
you
re
a
pampered
darling
of
luxurious
gracious
what
an
awful
thing
to
be
cried
patty
in
mock
dismay
and
anyway
patty
said
the
blunt
mona
if
you
hadn
t
put
all
those
old
weedy
flowers
on
the
tablecloth
there
wouldn
t
be
any
ants
and
things
they
ve
mostly
come
out
of
your
i
believe
you
re
right
said
patty
laughing
so
the
picnic
is
a
success
after
all
and
it
s
only
our
decorations
that
made
any
then
they
all
ate
heartily
of
the
feast
and
there
was
much
laughter
and
merriment
and
afterward
they
sat
round
the
fire
and
told
stories
and
sang
songs
and
they
all
declared
it
was
the
very
nicest
picnic
ever
was
and
they
were
sorry
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
but
we
must
be
going
patty
said
for
i
promised
nan
we
d
be
home
in
ample
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
it
s
a
fairly
long
do
we
go
back
the
same
way
we
came
asked
elise
looking
at
philip
with
an
arch
air
of
enquiry
go
back
any
way
you
please
fair
lady
he
replied
the
way
we
came
is
the
shortest
but
there
is
a
longer
way
round
if
you
prefer
i
don
t
mean
that
said
elise
i
mean
do
we
go
with
the
same
partners
i
do
declared
philip
and
miss
fairfield
does
the
rest
of
you
may
do
just
as
you
then
i
think
we
ll
go
as
we
came
said
elise
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
the
simplicity
of
philip
s
picnic
made
it
an
easy
matter
to
pack
up
to
go
home
as
there
was
little
beside
the
tablecloth
to
take
with
them
and
so
they
were
soon
ready
for
the
homeward
trip
as
host
philip
sent
off
the
other
cars
first
and
after
they
were
all
started
he
stepped
into
the
swift
camilla
beside
patty
who
was
already
in
the
driving
seat
i
m
going
to
drive
home
you
know
she
said
i
m
simply
dying
to
get
hold
of
this
steering
bar
once
all
right
you
may
drive
but
let
s
go
round
the
other
route
it
s
only
a
little
bit
how
much
longer
not
more
than
a
mile
or
two
at
the
are
you
sure
of
that
positive
all
right
then
we
ve
time
enough
where
do
we
turn
off
at
this
next
turn
to
the
left
that
takes
us
around
past
berry
hill
and
so
on
around
by
blue
oh
yes
i
know
the
way
after
we
reach
blue
lake
here
we
go
then
patty
took
the
turn
philip
had
indicated
and
as
she
did
so
she
caught
the
last
glimpse
of
the
other
three
cars
disappearing
in
the
distance
as
they
went
home
by
the
same
road
they
came
the
road
she
had
turned
into
was
far
more
picturesque
and
beautiful
and
as
this
portion
of
it
was
new
to
her
she
was
delighted
to
see
it
what
high
hills
she
exclaimed
why
they
re
almost
mountains
hardly
that
but
they
are
fairly
high
hills
to
be
so
near
the
seashore
don
t
you
want
me
to
drive
patty
this
road
has
sharp
corners
and
around
these
hills
it
s
hard
to
see
anybody
no
i
ll
drive
and
you
keep
a
watch
out
we
haven
t
met
a
car
no
and
i
wonder
at
it
usually
there
are
lots
of
racers
and
touring
cars
along
here
but
of
course
it
s
early
in
the
season
for
how
is
that
you
are
so
familiar
with
this
locality
you
seem
to
know
all
about
i
spent
a
summer
down
here
some
years
ago
that
s
how
i
knew
where
that
picnic
ground
is
look
out
there
s
a
bad
place
in
the
road
but
patty
had
already
seen
it
and
was
skilfully
steering
so
as
to
avoid
it
you
see
everything
said
philip
admiringly
you
re
a
wonderful
little
motorist
i
never
saw
anybody
drive
better
than
you
do
and
so
easily
too
merciful
heavens
patty
gave
a
jump
at
philip
s
excited
exclamation
and
saw
straight
in
front
of
her
an
immense
red
car
at
full
speed
it
had
swung
around
a
sharp
angle
and
could
not
possibly
have
been
seen
by
them
until
it
burst
on
their
vision
not
twenty
yards
away
they
had
heard
no
signal
which
was
culpable
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
driver
of
the
big
car
and
perhaps
patty
was
equally
culpable
in
not
having
sounded
her
own
horn
but
this
was
no
time
to
think
of
such
matters
for
they
were
really
in
perilous
danger
the
driver
of
the
big
car
did
nothing
to
avert
disaster
it
could
not
be
he
was
indifferent
to
the
awful
situation
he
looked
more
as
if
he
were
stunned
by
the
sudden
realisation
of
it
patty
was
absolutely
paralysed
with
fear
she
realised
fully
their
plight
she
knew
that
nothing
could
save
them
from
instant
and
terrible
collision
and
her
muscles
were
absolutely
powerless
to
move
the
short
distance
between
the
two
cars
diminished
like
lightning
and
neither
car
had
swerved
from
a
straight
line
leading
to
the
other
patty
tried
to
shriek
but
her
stiffened
tongue
gave
forth
no
sound
at
sight
of
the
big
car
philip
van
reypen
was
stunned
also
but
in
an
instant
he
recovered
his
senses
and
in
another
instant
he
had
shot
out
his
right
hand
and
seizing
the
controller
handle
pushed
it
backward
with
a
force
that
nearly
crushed
patty
s
hand
that
held
it
then
grasping
the
steering
bar
with
his
other
hand
he
swerved
the
car
over
to
the
right
blindly
trying
to
find
the
reverse
lever
with
his
foot
then
happened
what
philip
knew
would
happen
the
camilla
banged
into
a
sheer
cliff
of
rock
but
took
it
sideways
he
grasped
patty
as
the
car
stopped
and
they
were
both
jolted
backward
by
presence
of
mind
and
quick
action
he
had
run
the
car
into
the
cliff
causing
thereby
a
minor
instead
of
meeting
the
big
red
car
in
a
collision
which
would
surely
have
meant
fatality
patty
was
very
white
but
she
did
not
faint
the
shock
restored
her
numbed
senses
and
she
turned
to
philip
with
a
glance
of
perfect
understanding
of
what
he
had
done
oh
patty
he
whispered
in
a
tense
voice
thank
heaven
you
re
safe
it
was
a
miracle
philip
but
you
did
it
yourself
i
knew
it
at
the
time
my
brain
worked
perfectly
but
my
muscles
were
paralysed
by
fear
oh
suppose
yours
had
been
too
i
could
have
done
better
if
i
could
have
sensed
the
thing
an
instant
sooner
for
a
second
my
brain
wouldn
t
work
and
then
i
saw
my
way
clear
like
a
flash
but
it
was
too
late
i
hadn
t
time
to
back
or
to
get
across
in
front
of
the
car
it
was
either
to
run
into
this
cliff
or
have
that
immense
machine
run
into
it
was
splendid
said
patty
the
tears
coming
to
her
eyes
and
then
the
reaction
from
the
shock
came
and
she
burst
into
violent
sobbing
don
t
patty
don
t
do
that
said
philip
in
a
pained
voice
and
patty
looked
up
smiling
through
her
tears
i
m
not
really
crying
she
said
it
s
just
a
foolish
reaction
and
i
can
t
help
it
i
m
sorry
to
be
so
silly
but
i
m
just
a
little
hysterical
from
joy
you
you
behaved
splendidly
patty
if
you
had
moved
hand
or
foot
we
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
it
was
only
because
i
could
get
full
command
of
the
controller
and
the
steering
bar
that
i
could
manage
at
all
if
you
had
given
a
convulsive
push
the
other
way
never
mind
that
but
i
expect
i
crushed
your
hand
when
i
grasped
the
controller
i
had
to
to
make
sure
that
you
didn
t
jerk
it
the
other
way
i
guess
you
did
hurt
my
hand
and
patty
held
it
up
to
see
sure
enough
black
and
blue
bruises
already
appeared
on
fingers
and
palm
poor
little
hand
said
philip
taking
it
in
his
own
i
m
so
sorry
don
t
talk
to
me
like
that
exclaimed
patty
as
if
i
were
a
i
m
glad
you
smashed
my
hand
as
that
was
the
only
way
to
save
us
from
certain
death
said
philip
gravely
and
then
they
heard
a
motor
coming
behind
them
and
looking
up
found
a
touring
car
which
was
about
to
pass
them
but
had
stopped
at
their
side
want
help
called
out
a
cheery
voice
and
philip
answered
indeed
we
do
the
stranger
jumped
out
of
his
car
and
came
over
to
inspect
the
camilla
i
ought
to
get
out
whispered
philip
are
you
brave
enough
to
sit
here
alone
patty
of
course
camilla
can
t
run
away
now
philip
and
the
other
man
looked
about
to
see
what
had
really
happened
to
patty
s
car
there
was
not
so
much
damage
as
it
seemed
at
first
for
with
the
exception
of
a
smashed
mudguard
and
some
dents
and
bruises
nothing
was
broken
except
the
shaft
drive
axle
but
this
of
course
rendered
the
car
helpless
as
to
her
motor
though
her
running
gear
was
all
right
i
ll
give
you
a
tow
said
the
stranger
heartily
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
spring
beach
answered
philip
are
you
going
that
way
i
can
go
that
way
as
well
as
not
and
when
people
come
as
near
death
and
destruction
as
you
people
did
i
think
it
s
only
human
to
take
you
home
perfect
marvel
though
how
you
escaped
with
so
little
injury
to
the
car
perfect
marvel
how
we
escaped
at
all
said
philip
i
did
what
i
could
but
when
i
see
the
narrow
margin
we
had
on
either
side
i
wonder
we
weren
t
smashed
to
bits
it
is
a
wonder
said
the
stranger
most
marvellous
thing
i
ever
saw
i
ve
seen
lots
of
motor
accidents
my
name
s
hampton
hampton
now
if
you
ll
help
me
rig
up
the
tow
i
ll
pull
you
and
so
after
a
short
time
philip
and
patty
still
seated
in
the
damaged
camilla
went
swiftly
along
towed
by
henry
hampton
s
powerful
car
of
course
when
they
reached
the
pebbles
an
anxious
crowd
awaited
them
it
s
getting
to
be
sort
of
a
habit
our
getting
home
late
with
an
accident
to
report
said
philip
as
they
turned
in
the
gate
and
patty
couldn
t
help
smiling
though
her
nerves
were
still
tingling
from
the
recent
shock
and
from
the
realisation
of
their
wonderful
escape
the
laughing
crowd
on
the
veranda
grew
suddenly
still
as
they
saw
a
strange
motor
enter
the
gate
with
the
camilla
in
tow
what
has
happened
cried
nan
as
they
came
within
hearing
distance
we
re
all
right
father
called
out
patty
anxious
to
allay
the
look
of
fear
and
consternation
on
her
father
s
face
patty
dear
child
what
is
it
exclaimed
fairfield
as
he
lifted
patty
still
white
and
trembling
out
of
the
car
an
accident
father
awful
accident
and
philip
was
the
hero
this
time
he
saved
my
life
and
he
did
it
in
a
most
wonderful
way
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
sometime
but
i
can
t
now
and
patty
fell
limply
into
her
father
s
arms
never
mind
darling
it
s
all
right
said
fairfield
soothingly
as
he
kissed
the
pale
brow
and
carried
patty
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
he
laid
her
on
a
couch
and
under
nan
s
gentle
ministrations
she
soon
revived
meantime
henry
hampton
was
telling
the
tale
as
he
had
understood
it
mighty
slick
piece
of
work
he
said
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
my
life
that
young
fellow
ought
to
have
medals
pinned
all
over
there
there
hampton
that
ll
be
about
all
said
philip
trying
to
shut
off
the
tide
of
compliments
from
the
stranger
no
taint
about
all
declared
hampton
wagging
his
head
but
i
guess
the
little
lady
can
tell
you
the
story
once
she
feels
like
herself
again
i
must
be
gettin
along
now
but
i
just
want
to
remark
edgewise
that
i
ve
seen
lots
of
pluck
and
bravery
in
my
day
but
for
intellect
coolheadedness
pluck
and
plumb
bravery
i
never
saw
such
an
exhibition
as
this
here
chap
put
up
all
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
hampton
went
away
philip
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
but
he
would
not
admit
that
he
had
done
anything
praiseworthy
or
unusual
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
he
said
only
one
possible
chance
to
take
and
of
course
i
took
it
and
almost
by
a
miracle
it
went
through
all
right
and
we
smashed
the
car
but
saved
our
don
t
you
listen
to
him
called
out
patty
you
people
come
in
here
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
was
driving
and
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
philip
to
get
hold
of
the
bars
across
but
he
did
it
and
he
did
it
in
time
and
he
did
it
exactly
right
and
i
just
sat
there
paralysed
with
fear
and
unable
to
move
but
i
suppose
you
don
t
expect
a
girl
to
be
very
brave
i
sort
of
collapsed
i
know
but
philip
is
a
hero
and
i
want
him
appreciated
as
he
is
patty
dear
said
her
father
and
though
he
s
awfully
modest
himself
about
his
brave
deed
he
has
the
honour
and
respect
and
gratitude
of
all
of
us
for
his
wonderful
quickness
of
brain
and
hand
that
saved
his
own
life
that
of
my
little
fairfield
s
voice
broke
as
he
folded
patty
in
his
arms
and
he
kissed
her

all
of
