look
in
the
old
legend
of
rip
van
winkle
with
which
the
american
writer
washington
irving
has
made
us
so
familiar
the
rip
wanders
off
into
the
kaatskill
mountains
with
his
dog
and
gun
in
order
to
escape
from
his
wife
scolding
tongue
here
he
meets
the
spectre
crew
of
captain
hudson
and
after
partaking
of
their
hospitality
falls
into
a
deep
sleep
which
lasts
for
twenty
years
the
latter
part
of
the
story
describes
the
changes
which
he
finds
on
his
return
to
his
native
village
nearly
all
the
old
familiar
faces
are
gone
manners
dress
and
speech
are
all
changed
he
feels
like
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
now
it
is
a
good
thing
sometimes
to
take
a
look
back
to
try
to
count
over
the
changes
for
good
or
for
evil
which
have
taken
place
in
this
country
of
ours
to
try
to
understand
clearly
why
the
reign
of
a
great
queen
should
have
left
its
mark
upon
our
history
in
such
a
way
that
men
speak
of
the
victorian
age
as
one
of
the
greatest
ages
that
have
ever
been
if
an
elizabethan
had
been
asked
whether
he
considered
the
queen
of
england
a
great
woman
or
not
he
would
undoubtedly
have
answered
yes
and
given
very
good
reasons
for
his
answer
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
english
almost
worshipped
their
queen
in
those
spacious
times
of
great
elizabeth
edmund
spenser
one
of
the
world
great
poets
hymned
her
as
fayre
elisa
and
the
flowre
of
virgins
helpe
me
to
blaze
her
worthy
praise
which
in
her
sexe
doth
all
excell
throughout
her
long
reign
courtiers
statesmen
soldiers
and
people
all
united
in
serving
her
gladly
and
to
the
best
of
their
powers
yet
she
could
at
times
prove
herself
to
be
hard
cruel
and
vindictive
she
was
mean
even
miserly
when
money
was
wanted
for
men
or
ships
she
was
excessively
vain
loved
dress
and
finery
and
was
often
proud
almost
beyond
bearing
notwithstanding
all
her
faults
she
was
the
best
beloved
of
all
english
monarchs
because
of
her
courage
and
strength
of
mind
and
she
made
the
crown
respected
feared
and
loved
as
no
other
ruler
had
done
before
her
and
none
other
save
queen
victoria
has
reigned
as
she
did
in
her
people
hearts
she
lived
for
her
country
and
her
country
love
and
admiration
were
her
reward
during
her
reign
the
seas
were
swept
clear
of
foreign
foes
and
her
country
took
its
place
in
the
front
rank
of
great
powers
hers
was
the
golden
age
of
literature
of
adventure
and
learning
an
age
of
great
men
and
women
a
new
england
if
an
elizabethan
rip
van
winkle
had
fallen
asleep
and
awakened
again
at
the
opening
of
victoria
reign
more
than
years
later
what
would
he
have
found
england
still
a
mighty
power
it
is
true
scarcely
yet
recovered
from
the
long
war
against
napoleon
with
nelson
and
wellington
enthroned
as
the
national
heroes
but
the
times
were
bad
in
many
ways
for
it
was
a
time
of
ugliness
ugly
religion
ugly
law
ugly

between
rich
and
poor
ugly

ugly

the
england
of
that
day
it
must
be
remembered
was
the
england
described
so
faithfully
in
charles
dickens
early
works
it
was
far
from
being
the
england
we
know
now
in
appeared
the
first
number
of
mr
pickwick
travels
pickwick
is
not
a
great
work
of
humour
merely
for
in
its
pages
we
see
england
and
the
early
victorians
a
strange
country
to
us
in
which
they
lived
it
is
an
england
of
old
inns
and
stagecoaches
where
manners
and
roads
were
very
rough
where
men
were
still
cast
into
prison
for
debt
and
lived
and
died
there
where
the
execution
of
a
criminal
still
took
place
in
public
where
little
children
of
tender
years
were
condemned
to
work
in
the
depths
of
and
amid
the
clang
and
roar
of
machinery
it
was
a
hard
cruel
age
no
longer
did
the
people
look
up
to
and
reverence
their
monarch
as
their
leader
england
had
yet
to
pass
through
a
long
and
bitter
period
of
and
stress
of
war
between
rich
and
poor
of
many
and
bewildering
changes
the
introduction
of
coal
steam
and
mechanism
was
rapidly
changing
the
character
of
the
whole
country
the
revenue
had
grown
from
about
pounds
in
to
pounds
in
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
the
national
wealth
and
resources
but
these
very
changes
which
enriched
some
few
were
the
cause
of
misery
and
poverty
to
struggling
thousands
machinery
had
ruined
the
industry
and
reduced
the
price
of
cloth
the
price
of
corn
had
risen
and
after
the
close
of
the
great
war
other
nations
were
free
once
again
to
compete
against
our
country
in
the
markets
where
we
so
long
had
possessed
the
monopoly
of
trade

the
period
which
followed
the
year
was
one
of
incessant
struggle
for
reform
and
chiefly
the
reform
of
a
parliament
which
no
longer
represented
the
people
wishes
considerably
more
than
half
the
members
were
not
elected
at
all
but
were
recommended
by
patrons
the
average
price
of
a
seat
in
parliament
was
pounds
for
a
borough
scotland
returned
members
and
cornwall
members
to

the
reformers
also
demanded
the
abolition
of
the

by
which
was
meant
the
stamp
duty
of
fourpence
on
every
copy
of
a
newspaper
a
duty
of
threepence
on
every
pound
of
paper
and
a
heavy
tax
upon
advertisements
the
new
poor
laws
aroused
bitter
discontent
instead
of
receiving
payment
of
money
for
relief
of
poverty
as
had
formerly
been
the
case
the
poor
and
needy
were
now
sent
to
the
workhouse
a
series
of
bad
harvests
was
the
cause
of
great
migrations
to
the
factory
towns
and
the
already
large
ranks
of
the
unemployed
grew
greater
day
by
day
the
poverty
and
wretchedness
of
the
working
class
is
painted
vividly
for
us
by
carlyle

he
speaks
of

kensington

four
years
had
passed
since
the
battle
of
waterloo
when
the
princess
victoria
was
born
and
england
was
settling
down
to
a
time
of
peace
after
long
years
of
warfare
in
george
the
fourth
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
the
duke
of
clarence
as
william
the
fourth
the
king
though
not
in
any
respect
a
great
monarch
he
proved
himself
to
be
a
good
king
and
one
who
was
always
wishful
to
do
the
best
that
lay
in
his
power
for
the
country
good
he
was
exceedingly
hospitable
and
gave
dinners
to
thousands
of
his
friends
and
acquaintances
during
the
year
particularly
inviting
all
his
old
messmates
of
the
navy
he
had
two
daughters
by
his
marriage
and
as
these
both
died
young
it
was
evident
that
the
princess
victoria
might
some
day
succeed
to
the
throne
her
father
the
duke
of
kent
married
the
dowager
princess
of
leiningen
who
was
the
sister
of
prince
leopold
afterward
king
of
the
belgians
as
a
young
man
the
duke
had
seen
much
service
for
when
he
was
only
seventeen
years
of
age
he
entered
the
hanoverian
army
where
the
discipline
was
severe
and
rigid
he
afterward
served
in
the
west
indies
and
canada
and
on
his
return
to
england
he
was
made
a
peer
with
the
title
of
duke
of
kent
he
was
afterward
general
and
in
canada
and
governor
of
gibraltar
at
the
latter
place
his
love
of
order
and
discipline
naturally
made
him
unpopular
and
owing
to
strong
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
troops
it
was
considered
wise
to
recall
the
duke
in
in
he
settled
in
brussels

soon
afterward
met

the
duke
still
kept
up
his
simple
soldierly
habits
for
throughout
his
life
he
had
always
believed
in
regularly
ordering
one
day
he
rose
betimes
and
took
a
cup
of
coffee
at
six
each
servant
of
the
household
was
allotted
his
or
her
regular
duties
and
was
obliged
at
least
once
a
day
to
appear
before
the
duke
there
was
a
separate
bell
for
each
servant
and
punctuality
in
attendance
was
insisted
upon
the
christening
was
attended
by
members
of
the
royal
family
and
a
dinner
was
held
to
celebrate
the
happy
event
the
duke
and
duchess
removed
soon
afterward
to
devonshire
and
they
were
both
much
pleased
with
the
beautiful
surroundings
of
their
new
home
the
duke
wrote
at
this
time
of
his
daughter
my
little
girl
thrives
under
the
influence
of
a
devonshire
climate
and
is
i
am
delighted
to
say
strong
and
healthy
too
healthy
i
fear
in
the
opinion
of
some
members
of
my
family
by
whom
she
is
regarded
as
an
intruder
how
largely
she
contributes
to
my
happiness
at
this
moment
it
is
needless
for
me
to
say
to
you
the
duke
had
been
determined
from
the
first
that
his
child
should
be
born
in
england
for
he
wished
her
to
be
english
both
in
upbringing
and
in
feeling
his
wife
who
is
described
by
those
who
knew
her
as
being
a
singularly
attractive
woman
full
of
deep
feeling
and
sympathy
fully
shared
his
views
on
this
point
in
january
when
only
years
of
age
the
duke
died
quite
suddenly
from
inflammation
of
the
lungs
following
upon
a
neglected
cold
he
was
a
man
of
deep
religious
feeling
and
once
in
talking
to
a
friend
about
his
little
daughter
future
career
he
said
earnestly
do
pray
simply
that
hers
may
be
a
brilliant
career
and
exempt
from
those
trials
and
struggles
which
have
pursued
her
father
but
pray
that
god
blessing
may
rest
on
her
that
it
may
overshadow
her
and
that
in
all
her
coming
years
she
may
be
guided
and
guarded
by
god
the
widowed
mother
now
returned
to
london
where
the
duchess
of
clarence
afterward
queen
adelaide
interested
herself
greatly
in
little
victoria
the
duchess
now
devoted
herself
entirely
to
the
care
of
her
child
and
never
did
any
little
girl
have
a
more
loving
and
devoted
mother
as
much
time
as
possible
was
spent
in
the
open
air
and
victoria
went
for
rides
about
kensington
on
a
donkey
which
was
led
by
an
old
soldier
a
great
friend
and
favourite
she
always
had
her
breakfast
and
supper
with
her
mother
and
at
nine
retired
to
her
bed
which
was
placed
close
to
her
mother
until
the
time
of
her
accession
she
led
as
simple
and
regular
a
life
as
thousands
of
other
little
girls
many
stories
are
told
of
her
early
years
to
illustrate
the
thoroughness
of
her
home
training
even
as
a
small
child
she
was
absolutely
truthful
and
her
chief
fault
that
of
wilfulness
was
due
to
some
extent
to
her
high
spirits
and
abundant
energy
she
was
especially
fond
of
dolls
and
possessed
a
very
large
number
most
of
which
were
dressed
as
historical
personages
she
had
practically
no
playmates
of
her
own
age
and
in
later
life
she
often
spoke
of
these
early
years
as
being
rather
dull
a
description
of
her
at
this
period
runs
she
was
a
beautiful
child
with
the
cherubic
form
of
features
clustered
round
by
glossy
fair
ringlets
her
complexion
was
remarkably
transparent
with
a
soft
and
often
heightening
tinge
of
the
sweet
blush
rose
upon
her
cheeks
that
imparted
a
peculiar
brilliancy
to
her
clear
blue
eyes
whenever
she
met
any
strangers
in
her
usual
paths
she
always
seemed
by
the
quickness
of
her
glance
to
inquire
who
and
what
they
were
there
was
as
was
natural
much
correspondence
between
england
and
the
home
of
the
duchess
for
the
second
son
of
the
duke
of
coburg
charles
albert
augustus
emmanuel
was
already
spoken
of
as
being
destined
to
be
victoria
husband
in
the
future
prince
albert
had
been
born
at
rosenau
on
august
and
was
thus
slightly
younger
than
his
cousin
he
is
spoken
of
as
being
a
very
handsome
boy
like
a
little
angel
with
his
fair
curls
and
was
for
a
time
much
spoilt
until
his
father
interfered
and
superintended
the
children
education
himself
ernest
the
elder
son
gives
us
a
charming
picture
of
his
father
we
children
beheld
in
him
and
justly
our
ideal
of
courtesy
and
although
he
never
said
a
harsh
word
to
us
we
bore
towards
him
through
all
our
love
and
confidence
a
reverence
bordering
on
fear
he
never
lectured
seldom
blamed
praised
unwillingly
and
yet
the
effect
of
his
individuality
was
so
powerful
that
we
accomplished
more
than
if
we
had
been
praised
or
blamed
when
he
was
once
asked
by
a
relative
whether
we
were
industrious
and
well
behaved
he
answered
children
can
not
be
naughty
and
as
they
know
well
that
they
must
learn
in
order
to
be
worthy
men
so
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
it
the
duke
liked
both
his
sons
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
their
elders
and
to
take
an
interest
in
art
and
literature
outdoor
exercise
riding
fishing
hunting
and
driving
formed
part
of
their
education
they
were
taught
from
the
first
to
endure
cold
and
discomfort
without
complaint
or
murmur
the
religious
teaching
they
received
had
a
deep
and
lasting
influence
upon
the
two
boys
both
at
that
time
and
in
later
years
but
they
had
a
thoroughly
happy
boyhood
and
did
not
suffer
from
a
lack
of
companions
after
their
confirmation
their
father
took
them
on
a
visit
to
several
courts
in
germany
and
also
to
vienna
a
journey
which
was
intended
to
open
their
minds
to
the
great
world
of
which
they
had
learnt
so
much
and
seen
so
little
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
king
leopold
the
brother
of
the
duke
of
coburg
thought
it
wise
to
make
a
careful
inquiry
into
the
life
and
character
of
the
young
prince

queen
thou
shalt

the

sceptre
can
not
move
as
those
pure
tears
have
moved
browning
when
she
was
five
years
old
the
princess
victoria
began
to
have
lessons
chiefly
with
a
governess
miss
von
lehzen
my
dearly
beloved
angelic
lehzen
as
she
called
her
these
two
remained
devotedly
attached
to
one
another
until
the
latter
death
in
the
young
princess
was
especially
fond
of
music
and
drawing
and
it
was
clear
that
if
she
had
been
able
to
devote
more
time
to
study
she
would
in
later
years
have
excelled
in
both
subjects
her
education
was
such
as
to
fit
her
for
her
future
position
of
queen
of
england
the
princess
did
not
however
know
that
she
was
likely
at
any
future
time
to
be
queen
she
read
much
chiefly
books
dealing
with
history
and
these
were
often
chosen
for
her
by
her
uncle
the
king
of
the
belgians
the
family
life
was
regular
and
simple
lessons
a
walk
or
drive
very
few
and
simple
pleasures
made
up
her
day
breakfast
was
at
eight
luncheon
at
one
and
dinner
at
seven
tea
was
allowed
only
in
later
years
as
a
great
treat
the
queen
herself
said
i
was
brought
up
very
simply
never
had
a
room
to
myself
till
i
was
nearly
grown
up
always
slept
in
my
room
till
i
came
to
the
throne
sir
walter
scott
wrote
of
her
at
this
period
of
her
life
this
little
lady
is
educated
with
much
care
and
watched
so
closely
that
no
busy
maid
has
a
moment
to
whisper
are
heir
of
england
i
suspect
if
we
could
dissect
the
little
heart
we
should
find
some
pigeon
or
other
bird
of
the
air
had
carried
the
matter
in
her
uncle
george
the
fourth
died
and
his
brother
william
the
fourth
came
to
the
throne
the
young
princess
was
now
the
next
in
succession
her
governess
thought
that
her
pupil
should
be
told
of
this
fact
and
as
the
duchess
of
kent
agreed
the
table
of
genealogy
was
placed
inside
victoria
history
book
where
by
and
by
she
found
it
the
story
goes
that
she
then
said
i
see
i
am
nearer
the
throne
than
i
thought
and
giving
her
hand
to
her
governess
added
i
will
be
good
i
understand
now
why
you
urged
me
so
much
to
learn
even
latin
my
cousins
augusta
and
mary
never
did
but
you
told
me
that
latin
was
the
foundation
of
english
grammar
and
of
all
the
elegant
expressions
and
i
learned
it
as
you
wished
but
i
understand
it
all
better
now
in
later
years
the
queen
recollected
crying
very
much
when
she
heard
of
it
but
could
not
recall
exactly
what
had
happened
it
is
interesting
to
note
what
those
who
knew
little
victoria
at
this
time
say
about
her
she
was
we
are
told
exceedingly
affectionate
very
full
of
high
spirits
fond
of
life
in
the
open
air
and
already
possessed
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
religion
she
had
been
taught
by
her
devoted
uncle
leopold
with
whom
she
corresponded
regularly
how
necessary
it
was
for
her
to
understand
thoroughly
the
duties
which
fall
to
the
share
of
a
ruler
during
the
years
which
followed
she
went
more
into
society
and
paid
visits
to
the
most
interesting
places
in
the
kingdom
everywhere
she
went
she
was
received
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
in
the
duke
of
coburg
with
his
two
sons
ernest
and
albert
arrived
at
kensington
palace
on
a
visit
and
thus
the
princess
met
for
the
first
time
her
future
husband
her
uncle
leopold
had
long
desired
to
carry
out
the
cherished
wish
of
his
mother
the
dowager
duchess
of
coburg
that
the
two
cousins
should
be
united
in
marriage
during
william
the
fourth
lifetime
all
mention
of
such
a
marriage
had
to
be
kept
secret
as
the
king
much
disliked
the
coburg
family
and
had
more
than
once
been
very
rude
to
the
duchess
of
kent
victoria
wrote
to
her
uncle
saying
how
much
she
liked
albert
in
every
way
and
that
he
possessed
every
quality
that
could
be
desired
to
render
her
perfectly
happy
she
was
very
anxious
that
her
uncle
should
take
her
cousin
under
his
special
protection
on
may
victoria
attained
her
majority
she
received
numbers
of
magnificent
presents
congratulations
from
public
bodies
and
in
the
evening
a
state
ball
was
given
at
st
james
palace
on
tuesday
june
of
that
year
at
twelve
minutes
past
two
king
william
the
fourth
died
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
lord
chamberlain
set
out
at
once
for
kensington
to
convey
the
sad
news
they
arrived
at
five
in
the
morning
and
were
told
that
the
princess
was
asleep
they
replied
that
they
were
on
important
business
of
state
to
the
queen
and
even
her
sleep
must
give
way
to
that

the

then
ensued

even
during
the
first
days
of
her
reign
the
queen
dignity
calm
and
knowledge
of
state
affairs
astonished
her
ministers
and
were
complete
proof
of
the
careful
training
she
had
received
during
her
girlhood
days
greville
clerk
to
the
council
wrote
she
presided
with
as
much
ease
as
if
she
had
been
doing
nothing
else
all
her
life
the
gracefulness
of
her
manner
and
the
good
expression
of
her
countenance
give
her
on
the
whole
a
very
agreeable
appearance
and
with
her
youth
inspire
an
excessive
interest
in
all
who
approach
her
and
which
i
ca
help
feeling
myself
in
july
the
queen
and
her
mother
left
their
home
to
take
up
their
residence
in
buckingham
palace
formerly
known
as
the
queen
house
the
present
palace
occupies
the
site
of
buckingham
house
which
was
erected
by
john
sheffield
duke
of
buckingham
in
it
was
bought
by
george
the
third
for
his
wife
in
remodelled
by
george
the
fourth
and
completed
by
william
the
fourth
who
however
had
never
lived
there
four
days
later
the
queen
went
in
state
to
dissolve
parliament
and
soon
afterward
removed
to
windsor
castle
where
she
was
joined
for
a
time
by
her
uncle
and
his
wife
prince
albert
wrote
her
a
warm
letter
of
congratulation
you
are
now
he
said
queen
of
the
mightiest
land
in
europe
in
your
hands
lie
the
happiness
of
millions
may
heaven
assist
and
strengthen
you
with
its
strength
in
that
high
but
difficult
task
i
hope
that
your
reign
may
be
long
happy
and
glorious
and
that
your
efforts
may
be
rewarded
by
the
thankfulness
and
love
of
your
subjects
on
thursday
june
the
coronation
ceremony
took
place
in
westminster
abbey
afterward
the
queen
made
a
royal
progress
and
was
greeted
by
immense
crowds
of
her
people
with
the
utmost
loyalty
and
enthusiasm
in
her
journal
she
described
it
as
the
proudest
day
of
her
life
mrs
jamieson
an
onlooker
wrote
of
her
as
follows
when
she
returned
looking
pale
and
tremulous
crowned
and
holding
her
sceptre
in
a
manner
and
attitude
which
said
have
it
and
none
shall
wrest
it
from
me
even
carlyle
who
was
standing
near
me
uttered
with
emotion
blessing
on
her
head
as
a
small
instance
of
the
queen
consideration
for
others
one
of
her
first
thoughts
after
the
ceremony
was
for
the
she
wrote
to
her
minister
lord
melbourne
asking
if
it
was
not
usual
to
give
a
week
additional
holiday
to
the
schools
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
lord
melbourne
was
from
the
moment
of
her
accession
the
queen
chief
adviser
and
from
the
many
letters
which
passed
between
them
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
see
with
what
affection
the
young
and
inexperienced
girl
regarded
him
he
is
not
only
a
clever
statesman
and
an
honest
man
she
wrote
to
her
uncle
leopold
but
a
good
and
a
man
whose
aim
is
to
do
his
duty
for
his
country
and
not
for
a
lord
melbourne
was
almost
a
second
father
to
her
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
largely
due
to
his
excellent
and
homely
advice
that
the
queen
was
able
during
the
early
years
of
her
reign
to
develop
in
such
an
astonishing
manner
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
retain
such
a
sweet
and
womanly
character
of
her
regularity
of
life
and
careful
attention
to
detail
we
learn
from
greville
diary
she
rose
soon
after
eight
and
after
breakfast
was
occupied
with
business
the
whole
morning
during
this
time
lord
melbourne
visited
her
regularly
at
two
she
rode
out
attended
by
her
suite
and
amused
herself
afterward
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
with
music
singing
or
romps
with
children
dinner
was
served
at
eight
to
the
whole
household
and
the
queen
usually
retired
soon
after
eleven
she
orders
and
regulates
every
detail
herself
she
knows
where
everybody
is
lodged
in
the
castle
settles
about
the
riding
or
driving
and
enters
into
every
particular
with
minute
attention
she
never
signed
a
single
document
of
any
importance
until
she
had
thoroughly
mastered
its
contents
in
october
her
cousins
ernest
and
albert
paid
her
a
visit
bringing
with
them
a
letter
from
their
uncle
leopold
in
which
he
recommended
them
to
her
care
they
were
at
once
upon
intimate
terms
and
the
queen
confided
to
her
uncle
that
albert
was
very
fascinating
four
days
after
their
arrival
she
informed
lord
melbourne
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
as
to
the
question
of
marriage
he
received
the
news
in
a
very
kindly
manner
and
said
i
think
it
will
be
very
well
received
for
i
hear
that
there
is
an
anxiety
now
that
it
should
be
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
you
will
be
much
more
comfortable
for
a
woman
can
not
stand
alone
for
any
time
in
whatever
position
she
may
be
the
queen
described
her
betrothal
as
follows
at
twelve
i
sent
for
albert
he
came
to
the
closet
where
i
was
alone
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
said
to
him
that
i
thought
he
would
be
aware
why
i
wished
him
to
come
and
that
it
would
make
me
happy
if
he
would
consent
to
what
i
wished
namely
to
marry
me
there
was
no
hesitation
on
his
part
but
the
offer
was
received
with
the
greatest
demonstrations
of
kindness
and
affection
i
told
him
i
was
quite
unworthy
of
him
he
said
he
would
be
very
happy
to
spend
his
life
with
me
she
wrote
to
her
uncle
i
him
than
i
can
say
and
i
shall
do
everything
in
my
power
to
render
the
sacrifice
he
has
made
for
a
sacrifice
in
my
opinion
it
is
as
small
as
i
can
in
the
following
november
the
news
was
made
public
but
it
was
not
received
with
any
great
enthusiasm
as
a
german
alliance
was
unpopular
there
were
other
suitors
for
the
queen
hand
and
the
majority
would
have
preferred
one
of
her
english
cousins
to
have
been
chosen
on
february
the
marriage
was
solemnized
at
the
chapel
royal
st
james
the
queen
was
described
by
those
who
saw
her
as
looking
extremely
happy
and
to
her
uncle
she
wrote
of
her
delight
at
seeing
the
huge
crowds
which
lined
the
streets
to
see
the
procession
pass
god
grant
that
i
may
be
the
happy
person
the
happy
person
to
make
this
dearest
blessed
being
happy
and
contented
what
is
in
my
power
to
make
him
happy
i
will
do
chapter
iv
and
after
four
short
days
the
queen
and
her
husband
returned
to
london
and
from
this
time
onward
the
prince
acted
as
his
wife
secretary
attending
to
every
little
detail
of
the
mass
of
correspondence
and
state
documents
which
grew
larger
with
every
succeeding
year
all
the
letters
received
by
the
queen
during
the
course
of
a
long
and
busy
were
carefully
preserved
and
at
her
death
they
amounted
to
no
fewer
than
five
or
six
hundred
large
bound
volumes
they
include
letters
from
crowned
heads
of
europe
from
her
ministers
of
state
from
her
children
and
from
her
friends
and
relations
all
these
the
queen
read
and
answered
she
was
thus
at
all
times
fully
aware
of
everything
that
was
happening
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
in
her
great
empire
an
empire
which
was
destined
to
grow
greater
and
greater
in
power
and
extent
during
her
reign
day
by
day
year
in
year
out
without
a
single
break
this
immense
correspondence
arrived
ministers
resigned
and
ministers
were
appointed
but
there
was
neither
halt
nor
rest
truly
burden
of
empire
is
heavy
for
those
who
bear
it
the
young
prince
determined
from
the
first
to
master
both
national
and
european
politics
for
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
as
he
was
a
foreigner
everything
in
this
country
was
for
some
time
strange
to
him
in
addition
to
being
his
wife
right
hand
he
took
a
leading
part
in
all
movements
which
might
help
to
improve
the
education
and
conditions
of
life
of
the
people
his
fine
training
and
sympathetic
nature
enabled
him
little
by
little
to
be
the
means
of
helping
on
important
reforms
in
addition
to
this
both
he
and
his
wife
found
time
to
work
at
drawing
and
music
which
they
studied
together
under
the
best
masters
throughout
the
queen
correspondence
one
reads
of
his
devotion
to
her
both
as
husband
and
helpmate
the
times
were
hard
discontent
with
poverty
and
bad
trade
kept
the
nation
ill
at
ease
and
as
is
always
the
case
there
were
many
who
did
their
best
to
stir
up
riot
as
a
consequence
possibly
of
this
unrest
attempts
were
made
on
the
queen
life
once
in
and
twice
in
the
relief
and
joy
felt
by
the
whole
nation
at
their
young
lucky
escapes
from
death
by
an
assassin
hand
are
expressed
in
the
following
lines
by
an
anonymous
author
god
saved
the
queen
all
thoughts
apart
this
crowning
joy
fills
every
mind
she
sits
within
the
nation
heart
an
angel
shrined
the
assassin
hand
the
steel
enclosed
he
poised
his
ruthless
hand
on
high
but
god
in
mercy
interposed
his
shadow
for
her
panoply
then
let
ten
thousand
lyres
be
swept
let
paeans
ring
sea
and
land
the
almighty
hath
our
sovereign
kept
within
the
hollow
of
his
hand
in
july
it
was
considered
necessary
to
appoint
a
regent
in
case
of
the
queen
death
a
bill
for
this
purpose
was
brought
in
and
passed
naming
the
prince
as
regent
this
pleased
the
queen
for
it
was
a
clear
proof
of
the
golden
opinions
the
prince
had
won
everywhere
since
his
marriage
and
it
was
passed
as
she
herself
said
entirely
on
account
of
his
noble
character
at
an
earlier
period
it
is
certain
as
lord
melbourne
assured
her
that
parliament
would
not
have
passed
such
a
bill
the
queen
was
soon
to
lose
her
chief
adviser
and
friend
for
in
june
parliament
dissolved
and
the
whigs
were
not
returned
to
power
lord
melbourne
could
however
resign
with
an
easy
mind
for
he
himself
recognized
how
valuable
a
counsellor
the
queen
now
possessed
in
her
husband
after
handing
his
resignation
to
the
queen
he
wrote
to
her
lord
melbourne
has
formed
the
highest
opinion
of
his
royal
highness
judgment
temper
and
discretion
and
he
can
not
but
feel
a
great
consolation
and
security
in
the
reflection
that
he
leaves
your
majesty
in
a
situation
in
which
your
majesty
has
the
inestimable
advantage
of
such
advice
and
assistance
the
queen
was
exceedingly
proud
of
these
words
of
praise
coming
as
they
did
unasked
from
a
minister
of
such
long
experience
it
was
in
the
same
year
that
the
prince
was
appointed
head
of
the
royal
commission
which
had
been
formed
to
encourage
the
study
of
the
fine
arts
throughout
the
kingdom
this
was
work
of
a
kind
which
he
especially
loved
and
he
was
now
in
a
position
to
influence
the
movement
which
led
to
the
great
exhibition
of
illustration
prince
albert
winterhalter

emery
walker
but
all
was
not
plain
sailing
for
the
prince
who
was
still
regarded
if
not
with
dislike
at
any
rate
with
some
mistrust
as
being
a
foreigner
for
a
long
time
yet
he
felt
himself
a
stranger
the
husband
and
nothing
more
still
all
cometh
to
him
who
knoweth
how
to
wait
and
he
set
himself
bravely
to
his
uphill
task
to
use
his
own
words
i
endeavour
to
be
as
much
use
to
victoria
as
i
can
this
was
the
keynote
of
his
whole
life
the
prince
took
sides
with
neither
of
the
political
parties
and
first
of
all
by
careful
economy
he
lessened
the
enormous
household
expenses
and
proved
that
it
was
possible
for
royalty
to
live
without
always
being
in
debt
he
established
model
farms
at
osborne
and
windsor
introduced
different
and
better
breeds
of
cattle
and
even
made
a
profit
on
the
undertaking
he
persuaded
his
wife
to
give
up
the
late
hours
which
were
still
usual
and
gradually
by
kindness
and
sympathy
won
the
household
staff
over
to
his
way
of
thinking
the
prince
life
was
an
extremely
full
one
soon
after
six
was
his
time
for
rising
until
nine
he
read
and
answered
letters
he
then
looked
through
all
the
principal
newspapers
and
gave
the
queen
a
summary
of
the
most
important
news
he
found
time
also
to
work
and
play
with
his
children
during
his
short
intervals
of
leisure
consultations
with
ministers
reading
and
writing
dispatches
followed
and
then
a
short
time
was
devoted
to
exercise
after
lunch
he
often
accompanied
the
queen
on
a
drive
more
reading
and
writing
took
up
his
time
until
dinner
after
which
there
was
either
a
social
evening
or
a
visit
to
a
theatre
he
was
complete
master
in
his
house
and
the
active
centre
of
an
empire
whose
power
extends
to
every
quarter
of
the
globe
no
british
cabinet
minister
has
ever
worked
so
hard
during
the
session
of
parliament
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
as
the
prince
consort
did
for
years
the
prince
had
no
holidays
at
all
he
was
always
in
harness

after
all
no

can
tell
chapter
v
life
upon
the
good
education
of
princes
and
especially
of
those
who
are
destined
to
govern
the
welfare
of
the
world
in
these
days
very
greatly
depends
the
love
of
children
was
always
a
strong
connecting
link
between
the
queen
and
her
people
no
trouble
was
ever
spared
by
her
to
obtain
the
best
possible
advice
on
the
training
of
her
own
family
the
nursery
was
as
well
governed
as
her
kingdom
acting
upon
the
advice
of
baron
stockmar
the
queen
determined
to
have
some
one
at
the
head
on
whom
she
could
thoroughly
rely
as
her
many
occupations
prevented
her
from
devoting
so
much
time
to
these
duties
as
she
could
have
wished
lady
lyttelton
who
had
been
a
was
appointed
governess
to
the
royal
family
in
and
for
eight
years
she
held
this
post
winning
the
affection
and
respect
of
her
young
pupils
and
the
gratitude
of
the
queen
and
her
husband
from
time
to
time
the
queen
wrote
her
views
upon
the
subject
the
greatest
maxim
of
all
is
she
declared
that
the
children
should
be
brought
up
as
simply
and
in
as
domestic
a
way
as
possible
that
not
interfering
with
their
lessons
they
should
be
as
much
as
possible
with
their
parents
and
learn
to
place
their
greatest
confidence
in
them
in
all
things
training
in
religion
to
be
of
real
and
lasting
value
must
be
given
by
the
mother
herself
and
in
the
queen
noted
with
regret
that
it
was
not
always
possible
for
her
to
be
with
the
princess
royal
when
the
child
was
saying
her
prayers
i
am
clear
she
said
that
she
ought
to
be
taught
to
have
great
reverence
for
god
and
for
religion
but
that
she
should
have
the
feeling
of
devotion
and
love
which
our
heavenly
father
encourages
his
earthly
children
to
have
for
him
and
not
one
of
fear
and
trembling
and
that
the
thoughts
of
death
and
an
should
not
be
represented
in
an
alarming
and
forbidding
view
and
that
she
should
be
made
to
know
no
difference
of
creeds
and
not
think
that
she
can
only
pray
on
her
knees
or
that
those
who
do
not
kneel
are
less
fervent
and
devout

their
prayers

the

the

care
of
his
wife
was
like
that
of
a
mother
nor
could
there
be
a
kinder
wiser
or
more
judicious
nurse
only
for
a
moment
was
he
disappointed
that
his
first
child
was
a
daughter
and
not
a
son
the
children
were
all
brought
up
strictly
and
were
never
allowed
to
appear
at
court
until
a
comparatively
late
age
they
were
all
taught
to
use
their
hands
as
well
as
their
heads
and
at
osborne
in
the
swiss
cottage
the
boys
worked
at
carpentering
and
gardening
while
the
girls
were
employed
in
learning
cooking
and
housekeeping
christmas
was
always
celebrated
in
splendid
fashion
by
the
family
and
the
royal
children
were
always
encouraged
to
give
as
presents
something
which
they
had
made
with
their
own
hands
lessons
in
riding
driving
and
swimming
also
formed
part
of
their
training
for
the
queen
was
wise
enough
to
realize
that
exercise
was
very
necessary
for
the
health
of
her
children
in
the
question
arose
as
to
who
should
educate
the
prince
of
wales
born
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
had
been
published
and
created
general
interest
baron
stockmar
was
again
consulted
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
prince
education
should
be
one
which
will
prepare
him
for
approaching
events
that
is
he
was
to
be
so
educated
that
he
would
be
in
touch
with
the
movements
of
the
age
and
able
to
respond
sympathetically
to
the
wishes
of
the
nation
the
rapid
growth
of
democracy
throughout
europe
made
it
absolutely
necessary
that
his
education
should
be
of
a
different
kind
the
task
of
governing
well
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
and
reigning
monarchs
were
criticized
in
an
open
fashion
such
as
had
not
hitherto
been
possible
after
much
thought
the
post
was
given
to
mr
henry
birch
formerly
a
master
at
eton
college
and
at
that
time
rector
of
prestwich
near
manchester
who
had
made
a
very
favourable
impression
upon
the
queen
and
her
husband
plain
people
as
well
as
princes
must
be
educated
and
this
fact
was
never
lost
sight
of
by
the
queen
and
her
husband
in
the
prince
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
at
that
time
no
fewer
than
children
between
the
ages
of
three
and
fifteen
absent
from
school
but
known
to
be
employed
in
some
way
he
pointed
out
also
and
this
seems
in
these
days
difficult
to
believe
that
no
less
than
children
were
not
attending
school
and
were
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
not
employed
in
any
way
at

the
most
interesting
visitors
whom
the
queen
entertained
during
her
early
married
life
were
the
emperor
nicholas
of
russia
and
louis
napoleon
of
france
the
emperor
nicholas
came
to
england
as
he
told
the
queen
to
see
things
with
his
own
eyes
and
to
win
if
he
could
the
confidence
of
english
statesmen
i
esteem
england
highly
but
as
to
what
the
french
say
of
me
i
care
not
he
was
however
undoubtedly
jealous
of
this
country
growing
friendship
with
her
old
enemy
france
but
any
attempt
to
weaken
this
met
with
no
encouragement
the
queen
in
writing
to
her
uncle
leopold
said
he
gives
albert
and
myself
the
impression
of
a
man
who
is
happy
and
on
whom
the
burden
of
his
immense
power
and
position
weighs
heavily
and
painfully
he
seldom
smiles
and
when
he
does
the
expression
is
a
happy
one
he
is
very
easy
to
get
on
with
in
a
further
letter
she
continued
by
living
in
the
same
house
together
quietly
and
unrestrainedly
and
this
albert
and
with
great
truth
says
is
the
great
advantage
of
these
visits
that
i
not
only
these
great
people
but
them
i
got
to
know
the
emperor
and
he
to
know
me
he
is
sincere
i
am
certain
even
in
his
most
despotic
acts
from
a
sense
that
that
the
way
to
govern
he
kindness
deeply
and
his
love
for
his
wife
and
children
and
for
all
children
is
great
he
has
a
strong
feeling
for
domestic
life
saying
to
me
when
our
children
were
in
the
room
are
the
sweet
moments
of
our
life
one
can
see
by
the
way
he
takes
them
up
and
plays
with
them
that
he
is
very
fond
of
children
and
again
she
wrote
he
also
spoke
of
princes
being
nowadays
obliged
to
strive
to
make
themselves
worthy
of
their
position
so
as
to
reconcile
people
to
the
fact
of
their
being
princes
the
effect
of
this
visit
was
to
make
france
somewhat
suspicious
and
the
queen
expressed
her
wish
that
it
might
not
prevent
the
visit
which
had
been
promised
by
king
louis
philippe
there
was
at
one
time
actually
danger
of
war
over
trouble
in
the
east
but
king
leopold
whose
kingdom
was
in
the
happy
position
of
having
its
independence
guaranteed
by
the
powers
was
able
to
bring
his
influence
to
bear
and
the
critical
period
passed
over
to
the
great
relief
of
the
queen

visit

very
eventful

surely
bring

fruits
the
king
was
immensely
pleased
with
everything
he
saw

with
the
friendly
reception
he
received
he
assured
the
queen
that
france
did
not

to
go

with
england
and
he
told
her
how
pleased
he
was
that
all
their
difficulties
were
now
smoothed
over
during
his
stay
he
was
invested
with
the
order
of

an
order
it
is
interesting
to
recollect
which
had
been
created
by

congratulation

declared
in
his
answer
that
france
has
nothing
to
ask
of

england
has
nothing
to
ask
of

like
when

have

paid
frequent
visits
and
made
many
tours
during

life
it
was
a
great
source
of
pleasure
to
both
of
them

feel
that
everywhere
they
went
they
were
received
with
the
greatest
delight

the
largest
and
the
brightest
and
the
gayest
and
the
most
excited
assemblage
was
at
cambridge
station
itself
i
think
i
never
saw
so
many
children
before
in
one
morning
and
i
felt
so
much
moved
at
the
spectacle
of
such
a
mass
of
life
collected
together
and
animated
by
one
feeling
and
that
a
joyous
one
that
i
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
any
woman
sides
can
bear
the
beating
of
so
strong
a
throb
as
must
attend
the
consciousness
of
being
the
object
of
all
that
excitement
the

she
has

occasion
for
since

had
been
imprisoned
there
no

and
bewildering
changes
which
followed
one
another
in
rapid
succession
during
the
early
years
of

it
is
necessary
to
read
the
literature

the
works
of
those
writers
who
took
a
deep
and
lasting
interest
in
the
lives
and

or
the
toiling
class
was
engaged
in
a
fierce
battle
with

enemies
it
was
a
battle
of
the
rich
against
the
poor

the
masters
against
the
men
of

england
was
a
sick
nation
at
war
with
itself
and
chartism
and
the
chartists
were
some
of
the
signs
of
the
disease
the
early
victorian
age
is
the
age
of
thomas
carlyle
the
stern
grim
prophet
who
undaunted
by
poverty
and
painted
england
in
dark
colours
as
a
country
hastening
to
its
ruin
his
message
was
old
and
yet
new
for
men
had
forgotten
it
as
they
always
have
from
age
to
age
this
was
an
age
of
competition
of
and
demand
brotherly
love
had
been
forgotten
and
payment
had
taken
its
place
carlyle
denounced
this
system
as
the
shabbiest
gospel
that
had
been
taught
among
men
he
urged
upon
government
the
fact
that
it
was
their
to
educate
and
to
uplift
the
masses
and
upon
the
masters
that
they
should
look
upon
their
workers
as
something
more
than
machines
the
old
system
of
guilds
in
which
the
apprentice
was
under
the
master
direct
care
had
gone
and
nothing
had
been
put
in
its
place
the
value
of
carlyle
teaching
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
insisted
upon
the
sanctity
of
work
all
true
work
is
religion
he
said
and
the
essence
of
every
true
religion
is
to
be
found
in
the
words
know
thy
work
and
do
it
the
best
test
of
the
worth
of
every
nation
is
to
be
found
in
their
standard
of
life
and
work
and
their
rejection
of
a
life
of
idleness

was

truly

for

to

much
accomplished
for
which
he

so
earnestly
striven
literature
was
beginning
to
take
a
new
form
the
novel
of
society
was
giving
place
to
the
novel
which
pictured
life
in
cruder
and
harsher
colours
the
life
of
the
toiling
north
of
the
cotton
spinners
and
weavers
was
as
yet
unknown
to
most
people
in
appeared
a
book
dealing
with
the
problems
of
working
life
in
manchester
mrs
gaskell
its
author
who
is
best
known
to
most
readers
by
her
masterpiece
achieved
an
instant
success
and
became
acquainted
with
many
literary
celebrities
including
ruskin
dickens
and
charlotte
bronte
whose
life
she
wrote
was
written
from
the
point
of
view
of
labour
and
and
which
followed
some
years
later
from
that
of
capital
her
books
are
exact
pictures
of
what
she
saw
around
her
during
her
life
in
manchester
and
many
incidents
from
her
own
life
appear
in
their
pages
and
shows
us
the
struggle
not
only
between
master
and
men
as
representing
capital
and
labour
but
also
between
ancient
and
modern
civilizations
the
south
is
agricultural
idyllic
the
north
is
stern
rude
and
full
of
a
consuming
energy
and
passion
for
work
these
are
the
two
englands
of
mrs
time
the
ways
of
the
manufacturing
districts
which
seem
unpleasing
to
those
who
do
not
really
know
them
are
described
with
a
faithful
yet
kindly
pen
and
we
see
that
each
life
has
its
trials
and
its
temptations
in
the
south
all
is
not
sunshine
and
the
life
of
the
labourer
can
be
very
hard
a
young
person
can
stand
it
but
an
old
man
gets
racked
with
rheumatism
and
bent
and
withered
before
his
time
yet
he
must
work
on
the
same
or
else
go
to
the
workhouse
in
the
north
men
are
often
at
enmity
with
their
masters
and
fight
them
by
means
of
the

that
just
a

talking

keep
th

in

and
just
walk
it
forward
like
a
black
to
frighten
naughty
children
with
into
being
good
i
tell
yo
it
their
part
their
cue
as
some
folks
call
it
to
beat
us
down
to
swell
their
fortunes
and
it
ours
to
stand
up
and
fight
hard
not
for
ourselves
alone
but
for
them
round
about
us
for
justice
and
fair
play
we
help
to
make
their
profits
and
we
ought
to
help
spend
it
not
that
we
want
their
brass
so
much
this
time
as
we
done
many
a
time
afore
getten
money
laid
by
and
we
resolved
to
stand
and
fall
together
not
a
man
on
us
will
go
in
for
less
wage
than
th
union
says
is
our
due
so
i
say
for
the
strike
the
story
appeared
in
a
new
magazine
of
which
charles
dickens
was
the
editor
he
expressed
especial
admiration
for
the
fairness
with
which
mrs
gaskell
had
spoken
of
both
sides
nicholas
higgins
whose
words
are
quoted
above
is
a
type
of
the
best
lancashire
workman
who
holds
out
for
the
good
of
the
cause
even
though
it
might
mean
ruin
and
poverty
to
himself
that
what
folk
call
fine
and
honourable
in
a
soldier
and
why
not
in
a
poor
dickens
himself
wrote
dealing
with
the
same
subject
this
appeared
about
the
same
time
and
the
two
books
should
be
read
and
compared
for
although
is
not
equal
in
any
way
to
and
it
is
interesting
as
ruskin
said
of
stories
allowing
for
the
manner
of
telling
them
the
things
he
tells
us
are
always
true
he
is
entirely
right
in
his
main
drift
and
purpose
in
every
book
he
has
written
and
all
of
them
but
especially
should
be
studied
with
close
and
earnest
care
by
persons
interested
in
social
questions
during
all
these
years
the
had
been
vainly
struggling
to
force
parliament
to
proceed
with
reform
of
their
grievances
in
a
monster
petition
was
to
be
presented
to
both
houses
by
their
leaders
but
london
was
garrisoned
by
troops
under
the
duke
of
wellington
on
the
fateful
day
and
the
chartist
army
broke
up
never
to
be
reunited
quarrels
among
themselves
proved
in
the
end
fatal
to
their
cause
a
new
party
the
christian
socialists
took
their
place
force
gave
way
to
union
and
a
new
champion
charles
kingsley
or
lot
stood
forth
as
the
chartist
leader
the
hard
winter
and
general
distress
of
the
year
nearly
provoked
another
rising
and
in
his
novel
entitled
kingsley
pictures
the
of

question
as
it
appeared
to
one
who
knew
it
from
the
seamy
side
especially
did
he
blame
the
church
which
he
said
offered
a
religion
for
jacob
the
smooth
man
and
was
not
suited
for
poor
esau
this
was
indeed
most
true
as
regards
the
agricultural
classes
where
the
want
was
felt
of
a
real
religion
which
should
gain
a
hold
upon
a
population
which
year
by
year
was
fast
drifting
loose
from
all
ties
of
morality
and
christianity
the
peasantry
once
the
mainstay
of
england
and
now
trodden
down
and
neglected
can
not
rise
alone
and
without
help
from
those
above
them
what
right
have
we
to
keep
them
down
what
right
have
we
to
say
that
they
shall
know
no
higher
recreation
than
the
hogs
because
forsooth
if
we
raised
them
they
might
refuse
to
work
are
to
fix
how
far
their
minds
may
be
developed
has
not
god
fixed
it
for
us
when
he
gave
them
the
same
passions
talents
tastes
as
our
own
the
farm
labourer
unlike
his
brothers
in
the
north
had
no
spirit
left
to
strike
his
sole
enjoyment
such
as
it
was
consisted
in
recalling
glorious
times
before
the
war
when
there
was
more
food
than
there
were
mouths
and
more
work
than
were
hands
say
vather
drawled
out
some
one
say
there
a
sight
more
money
in
england
now
than
there
was
afore
the
booy
said
the
old
man
got
into
too
few
the
system
of
among
the
london
tailors
had
grown
to
such
an
extent
that
kingsley
was
determined
if
possible
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
with
this
purpose
in
view
he
wrote
clothes
and
the
government
itself
he
declares
does
nothing
to
prevent
sweating
the
workmen
declare
that
government
contract
work
is
the
worst
of
all
and
the
and
tailor
last
resource
there
are
more
clergymen
among
the
customers
than
any
other
class
and
often
we
have
to
work
at
home
upon
the
sunday
at
their
clothes
in
order
to
get
a
living
he
followed
this
up
with
dealing
especially
with
the
life
and
conditions
of
work
of
the
journeymen
tailors
and
the
chartist
riots
both
sides
receive
some
hard
knocks
for
kingsley
was
a
born
fighter
and
his
courage
and
fearlessness
won
him
many
friends
even
among
the
most
violent
of
the
chartists
the
character
of
alton
locke
was
probably
drawn
from
life
and
was
intended
to
be
william
lovett
at
one
time
a
leader
in
the
chartist
ranks
after
a
long
fight
with
poverty
when
he
frequently
went
without
a
meal
in
order
to
save
the
money
necessary
for
his
education
he
rose
to
a
position
of
some
influence
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
propose
that
museums
and
public
galleries
should
be
opened
on
sundays
for
he
declared
that
most
of
the
intemperance
and
vice
was
owing
to
the
want
of
wholesome
and
rational
recreation
he
insisted
that
it
was
necessary
to
create
a
moral
sober
and
thinking
in
order
to
enable
them
to
carry
through
the
reforms
for
which
they
were
struggling
disgust
with
the
violent
methods
of
many
of
his
associates
caused
him
at
last
to
withdraw
from
their
ranks
kingsley
looked
up
to
carlyle
as
his
master
to
whom
he
owed
more
than
to
any
other
man
of
the
general
effect
he
said
which
his
works
had
upon
me
i
shall
say
nothing
it
was
the
same
as
they
have
had
thank
god
on
thousands
of
my
class
and
every
other
when
finally
violent
methods
proved
of
no
avail
and
the
chartist
party
dissolved
the
democratic
movement
took
a
fresh
lease
of
life
as
carlyle
had
already
pointed
out
the
question
of
the
people
was
a
and
fork
question
that
is
to
say
so
long
as
taxes
were
levied
upon
the
necessities
of
life
the
poorer
classes
who
could
least
of
all
afford
to
pay
would
become
poorer
sir
robert
peel
was
the
first
to
remove
this
injustice
by
substituting
a
tax
upon
income
for
the
hundred
and
one
taxes
which
had
pressed
so
heavily
upon
the
poor
manufacturers
were
now
able
to
buy
their
raw
materials
at
a
lower
price
and
need
no
longer
pay
such
low
wages
to
keep
up
their
profits
in
peel
went
a
step
farther
and
in
order
to
relieve
the
famine
in
ireland
he
removed
the
duty
on
corn
thus
since
corn
could
now
be
imported
free
bread
became
cheaper
the
corn
law
repealers
had
fought
for
years
to
bring
this
about
their
leader
and
poet
ebenezer
elliott
declared
that
what
they
wanted
was
bread
in
exchange
for
their
cottons
woollens
and
hardware
and
no
other
thing
can
supply
the
want
of
that
one
thing
any
more
than
water
could
supply
the
want
of
air
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
bad
government
is
the
deadly
will
that
takes
what
labour
ought
to
keep
it
is
the
deadly
power
that
makes
bread
dear
and
labour
cheap
it
was
not
until
there
had
been
many
riots
and
much
bloodshed
that
the
irish
famine
forced
peel
at
last
to
give
way
a
third
party
of
reformers
were
working
for
the
same
end
this
was
the
england
party
whose
leader
was
disraeli
a
rising
young
politician
by
birth
a
jew
he
had
joined
the
english
church
and
the
ranks
of
the
tory
party
his
early
works
are
chiefly
sketches
of
social
and
political
life
and
are
not
concerned
with
the
of
the
people
he
took
as
his
motto
the
words
shakespeare
puts
into
ancient
pistol
mouth
why
then
the
world
mine
oyster
which
i
with
sword
will
open
thus
showing
at
an
early
age
that
he
had
a
firm
belief
in
his
own
powers
from
the
beginning
of
his
career
he
never
hesitated
in
championing
the
cause
of
the
people
and
declared
that
he
was
not
afraid
or
ashamed

the
chartists
were
opposed
to
the

party
for
they
thought
that
the
cry
of
bread
meant
simply
wages
and
was
a
trap
set
to
catch
them
unawares
the
young
england
party
believed
in
themselves
as
the
leaders
of
a
movement
which
should
save
england
through
its
youth
they
were
however
known
in
parliament
in
their
early
days
as
young
gentlemen
who
wore
white
waistcoats
and
wrote
spoony
poetry
england
wished
for
a
return
of
the
feudal
relations
between
the
nobility
and
their
vassals
the
nobles
and
the
church
as
in
olden
days
were
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
to
the
poor
to
feed
the
hungry
and
succour
the
distressed
national
customs
were
to
be
revived
commerce
and
art
were
to
be
fostered
by
wealthy
patrons
the
crown
was
once
more
to
be
in
touch
with
the
people
if
royalty
did
but
condescend
to
lower
itself
to
a
familiarity
with
the
people
it
is
curious
that
they
will
raise
exalt
and
adore
it
sometimes
even
invest
it
with
divine
and
mysterious
attributes
if
on
the
contrary
it
shuts
itself
up
in
an
august
seclusion
it
will
be
mocked
and
caricatured
if
the
great
only
knew
what
stress
the
poor
lay
by
the
few
forms
that
remain
to
join
them
they
would
make
many
sacrifices
for
their
maintenance
and
preservation

in

ideas
of
their
upbringing
and
education
at
the
beginning
of
her
reign
the
little
children
of
the
poor
were
for
the
most
part
slaves
and
were
often
punished
more
cruelly
by
their
taskmasters
than
the
slaves
one
reads
of
in
tom
when
disraeli
afterward
lord
beaconsfield
and
prime
minister
wrote
he
drew
in
that
book
a
terrible
picture
of
the
life
of
children
in
the
manufacturing
districts
and
in
the
country
villages
the
following
extract
speaks
for
itself
there
are
many
in
this
town
who
are
ignorant
of
their
very
names
very
few
who
can
spell
them
it
is
rare
that
you
meet
with
a
young
person
who
knows
his
own
age
rarer
to
find
the
boy
who
has
seen
a
book
or
the
girl
who
has
seen
a
flower
ask
them
the
name
of
their
sovereign
and
they
will
laugh
who
rules
them
on
earth
or
who
can
save
them
in
heaven
are
alike
mysteries
to
them
in
such
a
town
as
disraeli
describes
there
were
no
schools
of
any
kind
and
the
masters
treated
their
apprentices
as
the
mamelouks
treated
the
egyptians
the
author
declares
that
there
is
more
serfdom
now
in
england
than
at
any
time
since
the
conquest
the
people
were
better
clothed
better
fed
and
better
lodged
just
before
the
wars
of
the
roses
than
they
are
at
this
moment
the
average
term
of
life
among
the
working
classes
is
seventeen
one
of
the
first
results
of
machinery
taking
the
place
of
human
labour
was
that
an
enormous
number
of
women
and
young
children
of
both
sexes
were
employed
in
the
factories
in
place
of
grown
men
who
were
no
longer
needed
especially
in
the
spinning
mills
thousands
of
men
were
thrown
out
of
work
and
lower
wages
were
paid
to
those
who
took
their
place
this
led
directly
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
home
and
the
wives
were
often
obliged
to
spend
twelve
to
thirteen
hours
a
day
in
the
mills
the
very
young
children
left
to
themselves
grew
up
like
wild
weeds
and
were
often
put
out
to
nurse
at
a
shilling
or
eighteenpence

day
one

too

away

the
wool
in
the
to
sleep
there
and
could
only
be
driven
out
of
the
factory
with
straps
how
many
hundreds
came
home
so
tired
every
night
that
they
could

but
the

weeping
bitterly
they
are
weeping
in
the
playtime
of
the
others
in

country
of
the

oh
say
the
children
we
are
weary
and
we
can
not
run
or
leap
if
we
cared
for
any
meadows
it
were
merely
to
drop
down
in
them
and
sleep
our
knees
tremble
sorely
in
the
stooping
we
fall
upon
our
faces
trying
to
go
and
underneath
our
heavy
eyelids
drooping
the
reddest
flower
would
look
as
pale
as
snow
for
all

we
drag
our
burden
tiring
through

or
all

we
drive
the
wheels
of
iron
in
the
factories
round
and
round
in
the

the
state
of
affairs
was
no
better
new
systems
of
industrial
production
threw
large
numbers
of
farm
hands
out
of
work
the
rate
of
wages
fell
and
machinery
steam
and
the
work
of
women
and
children
took
the
place
of
the
labourer
the
children
found
a
champion
in
lord
ashley
afterward
lord
shaftesbury
who
succeeded
in
the
face
of
much
opposition
in
his
efforts
to
pass
laws
which
should
do
away
with
such
shameful
wrong
and
injustice
the
increased
amount
of
coal
used
million
tons
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
million
tons
in
naturally
led
to
the
demand
for
more
workers
and
it
was
owing
to
this
that
the
proposals
of
lord
shaftesbury
met
with
such
opposition
from
the
who
feared
that
if
child
labour
were
made
illegal
they
would
not
have
sufficient
to
work
the
mines
and
that
they
would
have
to
pay
higher
wages
the
act
of
forbade
altogether
the
employment
of
women
and
girls
in
the
mines
and
allowed
only
boys
of
the
age
of
ten
or
more
to
do
such
work
the
poor
law
guardians
of
the
time
used
to
send
children
into
the
mines
at
the
age
of
seven
as
a
means
of
finding
employment
for
them
the
hours
of
work
were
limited
to
ten
daily
and
each
week
little
or
no
attempt
was
made
in
the
bill
to
give
children
the
means
of
obtaining
a
good
education
although
considerably
more
than
half
the
children
in
the
country
never
went
to
school
at
all
and
many
large
towns
were
without
a
proper
school
by
a
previous
factory
act
of
all
children
under
fourteen
years
of
age
were
compelled
to
attend
school
for
two
hours
daily
the
employer
was
allowed
to
deduct
one
penny
a
week
from
the
child
wages
to
pay
the
teacher
this
proved
absolutely
useless
as
the
masters
employed
workers
as
teachers
and
in
consequence
the
children
learnt
nothing
at
all
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
a
bill
was
passed
in
parliament
to
create
an
adequate
number
of
public
elementary
schools
for
every
district
in
the
kingdom
to
show
the
increase
in
the
number
of
schools
built
there
were
in
the
year
and
in
the
year
but
the
children
of
england
owe
almost
as
much
to
charles
dickens
as
they
do
to
lord
shaftesbury
he
was
almost
the
first
and
certainly
the
greatest
writer
who
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
sympathy
for
little
children
has
left
us
in
his
books
a
gallery
of
portraits
which
no
one
can
ever
forget
he
himself
a
very
small
and
not
boy
passed
through
a
time
of
bitter
poverty
and
his
stay
at
school
short
as
it
was
was
not
a
period
of
his
life
upon
which
he
looked
back
with
any
pleasure
the
material
for
his
books
was
drawn
from
life
from
his
own
and
from
the
lives
of
those
around
him
and
for
this
reason
all
that
he
wrote
will
always
be
of
great
value
as
it
gives
us
a
good
idea
of
the
early
and
mid
victorian
days
his
ambition
was
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
poor
to
leave
one
hand
upon
the
time
lastingly
upon
the
time
with
one
tender
touch
for
the
mass
of
toiling
people
who
can
ever
forget
in
the
the
crippled
tiny
tim
who
behaved
as
good
as
gold
and
better
somehow
he
gets
thoughtful
sitting
by
himself
so
much
and
thinks
the
strangest
things
you
ever
heard
he
told
me
coming
home
that
he
hoped
the
people
saw
him
in
the
church
because
he
was
a
cripple
and
it
might
be
pleasant
to
them
to
remember
upon
christmas
day
who
made
lame
beggars
walk
and
blind
men
see
other
pictures
of
suffering
childhood
are
nell
and
marchioness
in
old
curiosity
and
in
and
the
victim
of
the
inhuman
schoolmaster
the
cruelty
of
the
times
is
shown
in
the
case
of
an
unfortunate
sempstress
who
tried
to
earn
a
living
by
making
shirts
for
each
once
when
she
had
been
robbed
of
her
earnings
she
tried
to
drown
herself
the
inhuman
magistrate
before
whom
she
was
brought
told
her
that
she
had
no
hope
of
mercy
in
this
world
it
was
after
hearing
of
this
from

the
lesson
taught
by
the
writer
that
the
two
chief
enemies
of
the
times
were
ignorance
and
want
the
lot
of
the
unfortunate
children
in
the
union
workhouses
was
no
better
they
were
treated
rather
worse
than
animals
with
no
sympathy
or
kindness
owing
to
the
ignorance
of
those
who
were
set
in
authority
over
them
any
one
who
reads
may
learn
the
nature
of
the
life
led
by
the
children
in
those
old
days
the
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
deep
philosophical
men
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
they
found
out
at
once
what
ordinary
folks
would
never
have
discovered
the
poor
people
liked
it
it
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poorer
classes
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
a
public
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
all
the
year
round
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
said
the
board
looking
very
knowing
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
we
stop
it
all
in
no
time
so
they
established
the
rule
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
for
they
would
compel
nobody
not
they
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
with
this
view
they
contracted
with
the
waterworks
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
and
with
a
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
and
half
a
roll
on
sundays
relief
was
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
and
that
frightened
people
a
movement
which
helped
possibly
far
more
than
any
other
to
better
the
lot
of
the
children
of
the
poor
commenced
with
the
foundation
of
the
ragged
school
union
of
which
the
queen
became
the
patroness
out
of
this
sprang
a
small
army
of
agencies
for
commencing
only
with
evening
schools
which
soon
proved
insufficient
the
founders
established
day
schools
with
classes
for
exercise
and
industrial
training
children
were
sent
to
our
colonies
where
they
would
have
a
better
chance
of
making
a
fair
start
in
life
training

followed
and
from
these

the
numerous

the
age

charles
dickens
took
the
keenest
interest
in
the
work
of
the
ragged
schools
a
letter
from
lord
shaftesbury
quoted
in
his
life
gives
a
clear
idea
of
the
marvellous
work
they
had
accomplished
up
to
the
year
after
a
period
of
years
from
a
single
school
of
five
small
infants
the
work
has
grown
into
a
cluster
of
some
schools
an
aggregate
of
nearly
children
and
a
body
of
voluntary
teachers
most
of
them
the
sons
and
daughters
of
toil
of
more
than
children
which
on
the
most
moderate
calculation
we
have
a
right
to
conclude
have
passed
through
these
schools
since
their
commencement
i
venture
to
affirm
that
more
than
of
both
sexes
have
been
placed
out
in
various
ways
in
emigration
in
the
marine
in
trades
and
in
domestic
service
for
many
consecutive
years
i
have
contributed
prizes
to
thousands
of
the
scholars
and
let
no
one
omit
to
call
to
mind
what
these
children
were
whence
they
came
and
whither
they
were
going
without
this
merciful
intervention
they
would
have
been
added
to
the
perilous
swarm
of
the
wild
the
lawless
the
wretched
and
the
ignorant
instead
of
being
as
by
god
blessing
they
are
decent
and
comfortable
earning
an
honest
livelihood
and
adorning
the
community
to
which
they
belong
dickens
believed
first
of
all
in
teaching
children
cleanliness
and
decency
before
attempting
anything
in
the
form
of
education

the
heavy
atmosphere
in
which
their
spirits

which
makes
them

callous

they
are

then
but
not
before
they
will
be
brought
willingly

of

was
a
fat
old
woman
this
mrs
gamp
with
a
husky
voice
and
a
moist
eye
which
she
had
a
remarkable
power
of
turning
up
and
only
showing
the
white
of
it
having
very
little
neck
it
cost
her
some
trouble
to
look
over
herself
if
one
may
say
so
at
those
to
whom
she
talked
she
wore
a
very
rusty
black
gown
rather
the
worse
for
snuff
and
a
shawl
and
bonnet
to
correspond
in
these
dilapidated
articles
of
dress
she
had
on
principle
arrayed
herself
time
out
of

on
such
occasions
as
the
present
the
face
of
mrs
gamp
the
nose
in
particular
was
somewhat
red
and
swollen
and
it
was
difficult
to
enjoy
her
society
without
becoming
conscious
of
a
smell
of
spirits
for
a
long
time
though
it
had
been
recognized
that
the
care
of
the
sick
was
woman

no
special
training
was
required

arrived
on
the
very
eve
of
the
battle
of
inkerman
within
a
few
months
of
her
arrival
it
is
estimated
that
she
had
no
fewer
than
ten
thousand
sick

in

charge

the
rows

there
in

kiss
her
shadow
as
it
fell
and
lay
our
heads
on
the
pillow
again
content
out
of
chaos
she
made
order

there
were
no

never
quitted
her
post
until
the

was
at
an
end
and
on
her
return

she
received
a
national
welcome
she
was
received
by
the
queen
and
presented
with
a
jewel
in
commemoration
of
her
work
and
no

than
fifty
thousand
pounds
was

since
this
time
no
war
between

peoples
has
taken
place
without
trained
nurses
being
found
in
the
ranks
of
both
armies
and
at
the
convention
of
geneva
some
years
later
it
was
agreed
that
in
time
of
war
all
ambulances
military
hospitals
should
be
regarded
as
neutral
and
that
doctors
and
nurses
should
be
considered
as
nursing
rapidly
became
a
profession
and
from
the
military
it
spread
to
the
civil
hospitals
which
were
used
as
training
schools
for
all
who
took
up
the
work

advice
was
sought
by
the
government
and
freely
given
upon
every
matter
which
affected
the
health
of

and
it
is
entirely
owing
to
her
influence
and
example
that
speedy
reforms
were
carried
out
especially
in
the
army
her
noble
work
was
celebrated
by

often
better
known
as

thus
thought

as
by
night
i
read
of
the
great
army
of
the
dead
the
trenches
cold
and
damp
the
starved
and
frozen
camp
the
wounded
from
the
in
dreary
hospitals
of
pain
the
cheerless
corridors
the
cold
and
stony
floors
lo
in
that
house
of
misery
a
lady
with
a
lamp
i
see
pass
through
the
glimmering
gloom
and
flit
from
room
to
room
and
slow
as
in
a
dream
of
bliss
the
speechless
sufferer
turns
to
kiss
her
shadow
as
it
falls
upon
the
darkening
walls
the
queen
followed
the
course
of
the
war
with
painful
interest
this
is
a
terrible
season
of
mourning
and
sorrow
she
wrote
how
many
mothers
wives
sisters
and
children
are
bereaved
at
this
moment
alas
it
is
that
awful
accompaniment
of
war
disease
which
is
so
much
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
fighting
itself

again
after

my
dear
brave
noble

i
saw

thank
god
upon
the

very
satisfactory
state

such
patience
and
resignation
courage
and
anxiety
to
return
to
their
service
such
fine
men
many
acts
had
been
passed
in
previous
reigns
to
improve
the
disgraceful
state
of
the
prisons
in
this
country
but
it
was
left
to
a
band
of
workers
mostly
quakers
led
by
elizabeth
fry
to
bring
about
any
real
improvement
any
one
who
wishes
to
read
what
dens
of
filth
and
hotbeds
of
infection
prisons
were
at
this
time
need
only
read
the
account
of
the
fleet
prison
in
the
and
of
the
marshalsea
in
reform
proved
at
first
to
be
a
very
slow
and
difficult
matter
new
laws
passed
in
and
insisted
upon
cleanliness
and
regular
labour
for
all
prisoners
chaplains
and
matrons
for
female
prisoners
were
appointed
the
public
however
got
the
idea
as
in
the
case
of
workhouses
that
things
were
being
made
too
comfortable
for
the
inmates
and
the
society
for
the
improvement
of
prison
discipline
was
bitterly
attacked
mrs
fry
had
started
work
in
newgate
prison
then
justly
considered
to
be
the
worst
of
all
the
bad
prisons
in
the
country
the
condition
of
the
women
and
children
was
too
dreadful
to
describe
and
she
felt
that
the
only
way
to
introduce
law
and
decency
into
this
upon
earth
was
by
influencing
the
children
she
founded
a
school
in
the
prison
and
it
was
not
long
before
there
was
a
marked
improvement
in
the
appearance
and
behaviour
of
both
the
children
and
the
women
the
success
of
her
work
attracted
public
attention
and
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
was
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
the
london
prisons
mrs
fry
was
called
upon
to
give
evidence
and
she
recommended
several
improvements
that
prisoners
should
be
given
some
useful
work
to
do
that
rewards
should
be
given
for
good
behaviour
and
that
female
warders
should
be
appointed
she
visited
other
countries
in
order
to
study
foreign
prison
systems
and
her
work
in
the
prisons
led
her
to
consider
what
could
be
done
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
unfortunate
women
who
were
transported
as
convicts
she
succeeded
in
improving
matters
so
much
that
female
warders
were
provided
on
board
ship
and
proper
accommodation
and
care
on
their
arrival
at
their
destination

and

of

like
a

point
out
your
very
worst

never
start
at

word
but
i
ask
you
why
you
keep
your
school
newgate
mrs

your
classes
may
increase
but
i
must
grieve
over
your
pupils
at
their

oh
though
it
cost
you
rent
and
rooms
run
high
keep
your
school
of

mrs
fry
in
the
face
of
domestic
sorrows
and
misfortunes
mrs
fry
persevered
until
the
day
of
her
death
in
in
working
for
the
good
of
others
the
work
in
this
direction
was
continued
by
mary
carpenter
whose
father
was
the
headmaster
of
a
bristol
school
she
began
her
work
after
a
severe
outbreak
of
cholera
in
bristol
in
at
this
time
there
were
practically
no
reformatory
or
industrial
schools
in
the
country
and
mary
carpenter
set
to
work
with
some
friends
to
found
an
institution
near
bristol
she
worked
to
save
children
especially
those
whose
lives
were
spent
in
the
midst
of
sin
and
wickedness
from
becoming
criminals
and
in
order
to
bring
this
about
she
aimed
at
making
their
surroundings
as
homelike
and
cheerful
as
possible
she
even
helped
to
teach
the
children
herself
as
she
found
great
difficulty
in
finding
good
assistants
she
wished
to
convince
the
government
that
her
methods
were
right
and
so
persuade
them
to
set
up
schools
of
a
similar
kind
throughout
the
country
the
great
lord
shaftesbury
was
her
chief
supporter
but
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
mary
carpenter
succeeded
in
her
desire
when
a
bill
was
passed
establishing
reformatory
schools
from
this
time
her
influence
rapidly
increased
and
it
is
mainly
owing
to
her
efforts
that
at
the
present
day
such
precautions
are
taken
to
reform
young
criminals
on
the
sound
principle
of
prevention
is
better
than
cure
mary
carpenter
also
visited
india
no
fewer
than
four
times
in
order
to
arouse
public
opinion
there
to
the
need
for
the
better
education
of
women
and
at
a
later
date
she
went
to
america
where
she
had
many
warm
friends
and
admirers
she
had
as
was
only
natural
been
keenly
interested
in
the
abolition
of
negro
slavery
one
of
the
most
distinguished
women
in
literature
during
the
victorian
age
was
harriet
martineau
at
an
early
age
it
was
evident
that
she
was
gifted
beyond
the
ordinary
and
at
seven
years
old
she
had
read
milton
paradise
lost
and
learnt
long
portions
of
it
by
heart
her
health
was
extremely
poor
she
suffered
as
a
child
from
imaginary
terrors
which
she
describes
in
her
autobiography
and
she
gradually
became
deaf
she
bore
this
affliction
with
the
greatest
courage
and
cheerfulness
but
misfortunes
followed
one
another
in
rapid
succession
her
elder
brother
died
of
consumption
her
father
lost
large
sums
of
money
in
business
and
the
grief
and
anxiety
so
preyed
upon
his
mind
that
he
died
leaving
his
family
very
badly
off
this
and
the
loss
later
on
of
the
little
money
they
had
left
only
served
to
strengthen
miss
martineau
purpose
she
studied
and
wrote
until
late
in
the
night
and
after
her
first
success
in
literature
when
she
won
all
three
prizes
offered
by
the
unitarian
body
for
an
essay
she
set
to
work
on
a
series
of
stories
which
were
to
illustrate
such
subjects
as
the
effect
of
machinery
upon
wages
free
trade
etc
after
the
manuscript
had
been
refused
by
numerous
publishers
she
succeeded
in
getting
it
accepted
and
the
book
proved
an
extraordinary
success
she
moved
to
london
and
her
house
soon
became
the
centre
where
the
best
of
literature
and
politics
could
always
be
discussed
she
was
consulted
even
by
cabinet
ministers
but
in
spite
of
all
the
praise
and
adulation
she
remained
quite
unspoiled
the
idea
of
women
taking
part
in
public
movements
was
still
not
altogether
pleasing
to
the
majority
of
people
who
were
apt
to
look
upon
women
as
a
name
first
used
in
england
in
the
previous
century
in
rather
a
contemptuous
way
come
let
us
touch
the
string
and
try
a
song
to
sing
though
this
is
somewhat
difficult
at
starting

and
in
our
case
more
than
ever
when
a
desperate
endeavour
is
made
to
sing
the
praise
of
harry

and

utter
not
a

about
your
house
but
she
take

to
mine
with
all
my
soul
she
might
take
and
pay
the
whole
but
that
is
all
my
eye
and
harry

her
political
economy
is
as
true
as

the
monster
of
distress
she
sticks

dart

still

makes

mighty

harry

in
she
visited
the
united
states
and
here
she
was
able
to
study
the
question
of
slavery
she
joined
the
body
of
the
and
as
a
result
was
attacked
from
all
sides
with
the
utmost
fury
for
the
northern
states
stood
solid
against
abolition
but
she
remained
unmoved
in
her
opinion
and
when
in
the
great
civil
war
broke
out
her
writings
were
the
means
of
educating
public
opinion
it
was
largely
due
to
her
that
this
country
did
not
foolishly
support
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
from
the
union
during
a
period
of
five
years
she
was
a
complete
invalid
and
some
of
her
best
books
including
her
stories
for
children
on
the
and
crofton
were
written
in
that
time
after
her
recovery
her
life
was
busier
than
ever
she
wrote
articles
for
the
daily
papers
but
her
chief
pleasure
lay
in
devising
schemes
for
improving
the
lot
of
her
poorer
neighbours
she
organized
evening
lectures
for
the
people
and
founded
a
mechanics
institute
and
a
building
society
during
her
she
was
the
acknowledged
leader
on
all
moral
questions
especially
those
which
affected
the
lives
of
women
it
has
always
been
esteemed
our
special
function
as
women
she
said
to
mount
guard
over
society
and
social
life

spring
of
national
existence
chapter
ix
it
was
in
balmoral
castle
that
the
husband
and
wife
most
loved
to
be
with
their
children
here
they
could
lead
a
simple
life
free
from
all
restraints
small
house
small
rooms
small
establishment
there
are
no
soldiers
and
the
whole
guard
of
the
sovereign
consists
of
a
single
policeman
who
walks
about
the
grounds
to
keep
off
impertinent
intruders
and
improper
characters
the
prince
shoots
every
morning
returns
to
luncheon
and
then
they
walk
or
drive
the
queen
is
running
in
and
out
of
the
house
all
day
long
and
often
goes
about
alone
walks
into
the
cottages
and
chats
with
the
old
women
the
queen
loved
her
life
here
even
more
than
the
prince
and
every
year
she
yearned
for
it
more
and
more
it
is
not
alone
the
pure
air
the
quiet
and
beautiful
scenery
which
makes
it
so
delightful
she
wrote
it
is
the
atmosphere
of
loving
affection
and
the
hearty
attachment
of
the
people
around
balmoral
which
warms
the
heart
and
does
one
good
it
was
during
the
year
that
the
royal
couple
paid
their
first
visit
to
balmoral
the
queen
had
long
wished
to
possess
a
home
of
her
own
in
the
highlands
where
her
husband
could
indulge
in
some
outdoor
sport
and
where
they
both
could
enjoy
a
brief
rest
from
time
to
time
from
the
anxiety
and
care
of
state
affairs
their
life
there
during
the
years
is
described
by
the
queen
in
her
diary
from
the
journal
of
our
life
in
the
it
was
first
published
after
the
prince
death
and
was
dedicated
to
him
in
the
words
to
the
dear
memory
of
him
who
made
the
life
of
the
writer
bright
and
happy
these
simple
records
are
lovingly
and
gratefully
inscribed
the
first
impressions
were
very
favourable
it
is
a
pretty
little
castle
in
the
old
scottish
style
there
is
a
picturesque
tower
and
garden
in
front
with
a
high
wooded
hill
at
the
back
there
is
wood
down
to
the
dee
and
the
hills
rise
all
around
their
household
was
naturally
a
small
one
consisting
of
the
queen
maid
of
honour
the
prince
valet
a
cook
a
footman
and
two
maids
among
the
outdoor
attendants
was
john
brown
who
in
was
attached
to
the
queen
as
one
of
her
regular
attendants
everywhere
in
the
highlands
and
remained
in
her
service
until
his
death
he
has
all
the
independence
and
elevated
feelings
peculiar
to
the
highland
race
and
is
singularly
straightforward
and
disinterested
always
ready
to
oblige
and
of
a
discretion
rarely
to
be
met
with
the
old
castle
soon
proved
to
be
too
small
for
the
family
and
in
september
the
of
a
new
house
was
laid
after
the
ceremony
the
workmen
were
entertained
at
dinner
which
was
followed
by
highland
games
and
dancing
in
the
ballroom
two
years
later
they
entered
the
new
castle
which
the
queen
described
as
charming
the
rooms
delightful
the
furniture
papers
everything
perfection
the
prince
was
untiring
in
planning
improvements
and
in
the
queen
wrote
every
year
my
heart
becomes
more
fixed
in
this
dear
paradise
and
so
much
more
so
now
that
has
become
my
dearest
albert
creation
own
work
own
building
own
laying
out
as
at
osborne
and
his
great
taste
and
the
impress
of
his
dear
hand
have
been
stamped
everywhere
he
was
very
busy
today
settling
and
arranging
many
things
for
next
year
visits
to
the
cottages
of
the
old
people
on
the
estate
and
in
the
neighbourhood
were
a
constant
source
of
delight
and
pleasure
to
the
queen
and
often
when
the
prince
was
away
for
the
day
shooting
she
would
pay
a
round
of
calls
taking
with
her
little
presents
the
old
ladies
especially
loved
a
talk
with
their
queen
the
affection
of
these
good
people
who
are
so
hearty
and
so
happy
to
see
you
taking
interest
in
everything
is
very
touching
and
gratifying
she
remarked
upon
them
we
were
always
in
the
habit
of
conversing
with
the
highlanders
with
whom
one
comes
so
much
in
contact
in
the
highlands
the
prince
highly
appreciated
the
good
breeding
simplicity
and
intelligence
which
make
it
so
pleasant
and
even
instructive
to
talk
to
them
in
september
soon
after
moving
into
the
new
castle
the
news
arrived
of
the
fall
of
sebastopol
and
this
was
taken
as
an
omen
of
good
luck
the
prince
and
his
suite
sallied
forth
followed
by
all
the
population
to
the
cairn
above
balmoral
and
here
amid
general
cheering
a
large
bonfire
was
lit
the
pipes
played
wildly
the
people
danced
and
shouted
guns
and
squibs
were
fired
off
and
it
was
not
until
close
upon
midnight
that
the
festivities
came
to
an
end
during
the
same
month
the
princess
royal
became
engaged
to
prince
frederick
william
of
prussia
who
was
then
visiting
balmoral
acting
on
the
queen
advice
prince
frederick
did
not
postpone
his
good
fortune
until
a
later
date
as
he
had
at
first
intended
but
during
a
ride
up
he
picked
a
piece
of
white
heather
the
emblem
of
luck
and
offered
it
to
the
young
princess
and
this
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
declaring
his
love
these
extracts
printed
from
the
queen
journals
were
intended
at
first
for
presentation
only
to
members
of
the
royal
family
and
her
majesty
intimate
friends
especially
to
those
who
had
accompanied
her
during
her
tours
it
was
however
suggested
to
the
queen
that
her
people
would
take
even
as
keen
an
interest
in
these
simple
records
of
family
life
especially
as
they
had
already
shown
sincere
and
ready
sympathy
with
her
personal
joys
and
sorrows
the
book
its
editor
says
is
mainly
confined
to
the
natural
expressions
of
a
mind
rejoicing
in
the
beauties
of
nature
and
throwing
itself
with
a
delight
rendered
keener
by
the
rarity
of
its
opportunities
into
the
enjoyment
of
a
life
removed
for
the
moment
from
the
pressure
of
public
cares
it
is
of
particular
interest
because
here
the
queen
records
from
day
to
day
her
thoughts
and
her
impressions
in
the
simplest
language
here
she
can
be
seen
less
as
a
queen
than
as
a
wife
and
mother
her
interest
in
her
whole
household
and
in
all
those
immediately
around
her
is
evident
on
almost
every
page
to
quote
again
she
is
indeed
the
mother
of
her
people
taking
the
deepest
interest
in
all
that
concerns
them
without
respect
of
persons
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
as
a
picture
of
the
royal
court
in
those
days
this
is
exceedingly
valuable
for
it
shows
what
an
example
the
queen
and
her
husband
were
setting
to
the
whole
nation
in
the
simple
life
they
led
in
their
highland
home
that
the
old
people
especially
loved
her
can
be
seen
from
the
greetings
and
blessings
she
received
in
the
cottages
she
used
to
visit

not
far
from
the

where
there
are
a
few
hillocks
was
a
pen
in
which
the
sheep
were
placed
and
then
just
outside
it
a
large
sort
of
trough
filled
with
liquid
tobacco
and
soap
and
into
this
the
sheep
were
dipped
one
after
the

one
man
took
the
sheep
one
by
one
out
of
the
pen
and
turned
them
on
their
backs
and
then
william
and
he
holding
them
by
their
legs
dipped
them
well
in
after
which
they
were
let
into
another
pen
into
which
this
trough
opened

here
they
had
to
remain
to
dry
to
the
left
a
little
lower
down
was
a
cauldron
boiling
over
a
fire
and
containing
the
tobacco
with
water

this
was
then
emptied
into
a
tub
from
which
it
was
transferred
into
the

a
very
lassie
with
a
plaid
over
her
head
was
superintending
this
part
of
the
work

helped
to
fetch
the
water
from

of
devonshire
service
to
the
position
of
the
greatest
designer
of
in
the
kingdom
he
took
his
main
ideas
for
the
crystal
palace
from
the
great
conservatories
at
kew
and
chatsworth
it
was
like
a
huge
greenhouse
in
shape
nearly
one
thousand
feet
long
and
ninety
feet
high
with
fountains
playing
in
the
naves
and
a
great
in
full
leaf
under
the
roof
on
may
the
opening
day
everything
went
well
the
crowds
in
the
streets
were
immense
and
there
were
some
visitors
present
in
the
building
during
the
opening
ceremony
lord
macaulay
was
much
impressed
with
the
exhibition
for
he
wrote
after
the
opening
i
was
struck
by
the
numbers
of
foreigners
in
the
streets
all
however
were
respectable
and
decent
people
i
saw
none
of
the
men
of
action
with
whom
the
socialists
were
threatening
us
i
should
think
there
must
have
been
near
three
hundred
thousand
people
in
hyde
park
at
once
the
sight
among
the
green
boughs
was
delightful
the
boats
and
little
frigates
darting
across
the
lake
the
flags
the
music
the
guns
everything
was
exhilarating
and
the
temper
of
the
multitude
the
best
possible
i
made
my
way
into
the
building
a
most
gorgeous
sight
vast
graceful
beyond
the
dreams
of
the
arabian
romances
i
can
not
think
that
the
caesars
ever
exhibited
a
more
splendid
spectacle
i
was
quite
dazzled
and
i
felt
as
i
did
on
entering
st
peter
i
wandered
about
and
elbowed
my
way
through
the
crowd
which
filled
the
nave
admiring
the
general
effect
but
not
attending
much
to
details
and
again
on
the
last
day
he
wrote
alas
alas
it
was
a
glorious
sight
and
it
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
all
whom
i
love
most
i
am
glad
that
the
building
is
to
be
removed
i
have
no
wish
to
see
the
corpse
when
the
life
has
departed
the
royal
party
were
received
with
acclamation
all
along
the
route
it
was
a
complete
and
beautiful
triumph
a
glorious
and
touching
sight
one
which
i
shall
ever
be
proud
of
for
my
beloved
albert
and
my
country
wrote
the
queen
six
million
people
visited
the
great
fair
during
the
time
it
remained
open
in
one
respect
however
it
could
scarcely
be
considered
a
triumph
for
this
country
it
was
still
an
ugly
and
in
some
respects
a
vulgar
age
the
invention
of
machinery
had
done
little
or
nothing
to
raise
the
level
of
the
public
taste
for
what
was
appropriate
and
beautiful
in
design
that
an
article
cost
a
large
sum
of
money
to
manufacture
and
to
purchase
seemed
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
untrained
mind
generally
speaking
the
taste
of
the
producers
was
uneducated
and
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
french
most
of
the
designs
in
carpets
hangings
pottery
and
silks
were
merely
copies
and
were
often
extremely
ugly
england
at
this
time
the
first
among
the
industrial
nations
had
utterly
failed
to
hold
her
own
in
the
arts
machinery
had
taken
the
place
of
handwork
and
with
the
death
of
the
latter
art
and
industry
had
ceased
to
have
any
relation
public
taste
in
architecture
was
equally
bad
a
of
the
art
of
the
middle
ages
resulted
only
in
a
host
of
poor
imitations
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
if
you
entered
a
cathedral
in
france
or
england
you
could
say
at
once
arches
were
built
in
the
age
of
the
conqueror
that
capital
belonged
to
the
earlier
henrys
now
all
this
is
changed
you
enter
a
cathedral
and
admire
some
iron
work
so
rude
you
are
sure
it
must
be
old
but
which
your
guide
informs
you
has
just
been
put
up
by
smith
of
coventry
you
see
some
painted
glass
so
badly
drawn
and
so
crudely
coloured
it
must
be

of
modern
styles
of
john
ruskin
who
was
in
many
ways
the
greatest
art
teacher
of
his
age
was
the
first
to
point
out
the
value
and
the
method
of
correct
observation
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
nature
and
in
art
in
an
address
on
modern
manufacture
and
design
delivered
to
the
working
men
of
bradford
he
declared
without
observation
and
experience
no
design
without
peace
and
pleasurableness
in
occupation
no
design
and
all
the
lecturings
and
teachings
and
prizes
and
principles
of
art
in
the
world
are
of
no
use
so
long
as
you
do
surround
your
men
with
happy
influences
and
beautiful
things
inform
their
minds
refine
their
habits
and
you
form
and
refine
their
designs
but
keep
them
illiterate
uncomfortable
and
in
the
midst
of
unbeautiful
things
and
whatever
they
do
will
still
be
spurious
vulgar
and
valueless
at
the
time
however
the
exhibition
proved
a
great
success
and
the
duke
of
coburg
carried
most
favourable
impressions
away
with
him
he
says
the
queen
and
her
husband
were
at
the
zenith
of
their
fame
prince
albert
was
not
satisfied
to
guide
the
whole
affair
only
from
above
he
was
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
the
soul
of
everything
even
his
bitterest
enemies
with
unusual
unreserve
acknowledged
the
completeness
of
the
execution
of
the
scheme
so
far
from
there
being
a
loss
upon
the
undertaking
there
was
actually
half
a
million
of
profit
the
proceeds
were
devoted
to
securing
ground
at
south
kensington
upon
which
a
great
national
institute
might
be
built
this
undertaking
the
purchase
of
the
ground
was
not
carried
through
without
great
difficulty
and
anxiety
the
queen
sympathy
and
encouragement
were
as
always
of
the
greatest
help
to
her
husband
and
he
quoted
a
verse
from
a
german
song
to
illustrate
how
much
he
felt
and
appreciated
it
when
man
has
well
nigh
lost
his
hope
in
life
upwards
in
trust
and
love
still
looks
the
wife
towards
the
starry
world
all
bright
with
cheer
faint
not
nor
fear
thus
speaks
her
shining
tear
the
great
exhibition
was
sufficient
proof
if
any
had
been
needed
of
how
the
prince
with
his
wife
laboured
incessantly
for
the
good
of
others
without
his
courage
perseverance
and
ability
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
great
undertaking
would
never
have
been
carried
through
successfully
he
recognized
the
fact
that
princes
live
for
the
benefit
of
their
people
his
desire
for
the
improvement
in
all
classes
was
and
from
him
his
wife
learnt
many
lessons
which
proved
of
the
greatest
value
to
her
in
later
life
when
she
stood
alone
and
her
husband
was
no
longer
there
to
aid
her
with
his
unfailing
wise
advice
a
second
exhibition
was
held
in
and
so
far
as
decorative
art
was
concerned
there
were
distinct
signs
of
improvement
manufacture
had
now
become
a
trade
phrase
but
manufacturers
were
still
far
from
understanding
what
really
meant
as
an
instance
of
this
one
carpet
firm
sent
a
carpet
to
be
used
as
a
hanging
on
which
napoleon
iii
is
depicted
presenting
a
treaty
of
commerce
to
the
queen
particular
attention
had
apparently
been
paid
to
the
on
napoleon
top
boots
and
to
the
queen
smile
the
prince
great
wish
was
to
restore
to
the
workman
his
pride
in
the
work
of
his
hands
to
relieve
the
daily
toil
of
some
of
its
irksomeness
by
the
interest
thus
created
in
it
and
where
the
work
was
of
a
purely
mechanical
nature
and
individual
skill
and
judgment
were
not
called
for
he
wished
the
worker
to
understand
the
principles
upon
which
the
machine
was
built
and
the
ingenuity
with
which
it
worked
his
schemes
for
the
building
and
equipment
of
museums
of
science
and
art
were
arranged
with
the
purpose
in
view
that
both
rich
and
poor
should
have
equal
opportunities
of
seeing
what
improvements
had
been
made
throughout
the
ages
and
how
vast
and
the
effects
of
such
improvements
were
on
the
lives
of
the
whole
nation
it
was
under
his
direction
that
the
pictures
in
the
national
gallery
were
first
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
the
history
and
progress
of
art
in
his
own
words
our
business
is
not
so
much
to
create
as
to
learn
to
appreciate
and
understand
the
works
of
others
and
we
can
never
do
this
till
we
have
realized
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
acting
on
this
principle
myself
i
have
always
tried
to
learn
the
rudiments
of
art
as
much
as
possible
for
instance
i
learnt
etching
lithography
and
in
music
i
learnt
thorough
bass
the
pianoforte
organ
and
singing
not
of
course
with
a
view
of
doing
anything
worth
looking
at
or
hearing
but
simply
to
enable
me
to
judge
and
appreciate
the
works
of
others
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
closely
the
views
of
the
prince
agreed
with
those
of
john
ruskin
in
matters
of
art
and
literature
ruskin
declared
that
it
was
the
greatest
misfortune
of
the
age
that
owing
to
the
wholesale
introduction
of
machinery
the
designer
and
maker
were
nearly
always
different
people
instead
of
being
one
and
the
same
person
he
declared
that
no
work
of
art
could
really
be
or
capable
of
moving
us
to
admiration
as
did
the
masterpieces
of
the
middle
ages
unless
the
maker
had
thought
out
and
designed
it
himself
it
was
largely
owing
to
his
teachings
that
the
and
movement
under
william
morris
and
walter
crane
arose
a
movement
which
has
since
that
time
spread
over
the
whole
civilized
world
in
together
with
some
of
his
friends
morris
formed
a
company
to
encourage
the
use
of
beautiful
furniture
and
to
introduce
in
the
house
morris
himself
had
learnt
to
be
a
practical
and
dyer
and
had
founded
the
society
for
the
protection
of
ancient
buildings
all
the
work
of
this
firm
was
done
by
hand
as
far
as
possible
only
the
best
materials
were
to
be
used
and
designs
were
to
be
original
they
manufactured
stained
glass
wall
paper
tapestry
tiles
embroidery
carpets
and
many
of
the
designs
were
undertaken
by
edward
dante
gabriel
rossetti
the
holman
hunt
best
remembered
by
his
famous
picture
the
light
of
the
world
and
others
formed
what
was
known
as
the
brotherhood
to
instruct
public
taste
in
creative
work
in
art
and
literature
at
the
kelmscott
press
some
of
the
most
beautiful
printed
books
of
their
kind
were
produced
under
the
direction
of
morris
ruskin
like
so
many
others
of
his
time
was
greatly
influenced
by
carlyle
and
his
views
on
the
of
england
question
were
practically
the
same
he
bewailed
the
waste
of
work
and
of
life
the
poverty
and
the
he
urged
employers
to
win
the
goodwill
of
those
who
worked
for
them
as
the
best
means
of
producing
the
best
work
he
preached
the
of
labour
that
high
wages
for
good
work
was
the
truest
economy
in
the
end
and
that
beating
down
the
wages
of
workers
does
not
pay
in
the
long
run
he
declared
that
the
only
education
worth
having
was
a
education
that
is
first
of
all
the
building
of
character
and
the
cultivation
of
wholesome
feelings
you
do
not
educate
a
man
by
telling
him
what
he
knew
not
but
by
making
him
what
he
was
not
was
the
theory
which
he
endeavoured
to
put
into
practice
by
experiments
such
as
an
attempt
to
teach
every
one
to
learn
to
do
something
well
and
accurately
with
his
hands
in
common
with
wordsworth
ruskin
held
that
the
love
of
nature
was
the
greatest
of
educators
he
believed
that
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
getting
and
spending
we
lay
waste
our
powers
the
beauty
and
the
everlasting
marvel
of
nature
works
were
to
him
as
to
the
poet
of
the
lakes
the
real
road
to
knowledge
come
forth
into
the
light
of
things
let
nature
be
your
teacher
an
education
of
not
the
brain
alone
but
of
heart
and
hand
as
well
all
three
working
in
was
necessary
to
raise
man
to
the
level
of
an
intelligent
being
ruskin
teachings
fared
no
better
than
those
of
carlyle
at
first
and
though
he
is
spoken
of
sometimes
as
being
yet
his
lesson
is
of
the
kind
which
does
live
and
will
live
for
like
dickens
he
knew
how
to
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
his
readers
he
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
writers
in
the
language
a
man
of
great
nobility
of
character
and
generous
feelings
who
had
a
tremendous
belief
in
himself
and
knew
how
to
express
his
thoughts
in
the
most
beautiful
language
some
of
his
books
for
example
and
and
this
are
probably
destined
for
immortality
chapter
xi
the
the
year
was
a
black
year
for
the
queen
on
march
her
mother
the
duchess
of
kent
died
she
had
been
living
for
some
time
at
frogmore
a
pleasant
house
in
the
windsor
home
park
and
here
in
the
mausoleum
erected
by
her
daughter
her
statue
is
to
be
seen
she
was
sincerely
loved
by
every
member
of
her
household
and
her
loss
was
felt
as
one
affecting
the
whole
nation
in
the
words
of
disraeli
she
who
reigns
over
us
has
elected
amid
all
the
splendour
of
empire
to
establish
her
life
on
the
principle
of
domestic
love
it
is
this
it
is
the
remembrance
and
consciousness
of
this
which
now
sincerely
saddens
the
public
spirit
and
permits
a
nation
to
bear
its
heartfelt
sympathy
to
the
foot
of
a
bereaved
throne
and
to
whisper
solace
to
a
royal
heart
the
death
of
the
queen
mother
came
as
a
great
shock
to
the
prince
consort
the
queen
was
for
a
time
utterly
unable
to
transact
any
business
and
this
added
to
his
already
heavy
burden
of
cares
and
responsibilities
in
the
following
november
the
king
of
portugal
died
the
prince
had
loved
him
like
a
son
and
this
fresh
disaster
told
so
severely
upon
his
health
that
he
began
to
suffer
much
from
sleeplessness
the
strain
of
almost
ceaseless
work
for
many
years
was
gradually
wearing
him
out
he
had
never
been
afraid
of
death
and
not
long
before
his
last
illness
he
had
said
to
his
wife
i
do
not
cling
to
life
you
do
but
i
set
no
store
by
it
if
i
knew
that
those
i
love
were
well
cared
for
i
should
be
quite
ready
to
die
i
am
sure
if
i
had
a
severe
illness
i
should
give
up
at
once
i
should
not
struggle
for
life
on
the
of
december
the
queen
felt
anxious
and
depressed
her
husband
grew
worse
and
could
not
take
food
without
considerable
difficulty
and
this
made
him
very
weak
and
irritable
the
physicians
in
attendance
were
now
obliged
to
tell
her
that
the
illness
was
low
fever
but
that
the
patient
himself
was
not
to
know
of
this
the
ministers
became
alarmed
at
his
state
and
when
the
news
of
his
illness
became
public
there
was
the
greatest
and
most
universal
anxiety
for
news
in
spite
of
slight
improvements
from
time
to
time
the
prince
showed
no
power
of
fighting
the
disease
and
on
the
evening
of
the
december
he
passed
gently
away
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
death
of
the
queen
beloved
husband
saddened
every
home
in
the
land
it
was
a
sorrow
felt
equally
by
the
highest
and
the
lowest
he
died
in
the
fulness
of
his
manhood
leaving
her
whom
he
had
loved
and
guarded
so
tenderly
to
reign
in
lonely
splendour
in
the
dedication
of
of
the
to
the
memory
of
prince
albert
tennyson
the
wrote
break
not
o
but
still
endure
break
not
for
thou
art
royal
but
endure
remembering
all
the
beauty
of
that
star
which
shone
so
close
beside
thee
that
ye
made
one
light
together
but
has
past
and
leaves
the
crown
a
lonely
splendour
when
one
looks
over
the
vista
of
years
which
have
passed
since
that
mournful
day
it
is
with
sadness
mingled
with
regret
for
it
is
too
true
that
a
prophet
is
not
without
honour
save
in
his
own
country
the
good
was
like
many
other
great
men
in
advance
of
his
times
and
not
until
he
was
dead
did
the
nation
as
a
whole
realize
the
blank
he
had
left
behind
him
even
so
late
as
greville
writes
in
his
diary
of
the
extraordinary
attacks
which
were
made
upon

after
letter
he
noted
appeared
full
of
the
bitterest
abuse
and
all
sorts
of
lies
the
charges
against
him
are
principally
to
this
effect
that
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
meddling
improperly
in
public
affairs
and
has
used
his
influence
to
promote
objects
of
his
own
and
the
interests
of
his
own
family
at
the
expense
of
the
interests
of
this
country
that
he
is
german
and
not
english
in
his
sentiments
and
principles
that
he
corresponds
with
foreign
princes
and
with
british
ministers
abroad
without
the
knowledge
of
the
government
and
that
he
thwarts
the
foreign
policy
of
the
ministers
when
it
does
not
coincide
with
his
own
ideas
and
purposes
and
again
it
was
currently
reported
in
the
midland
and
northern
counties
and
actually
stated
in
a
scotch
paper
that
prince
albert
had
been
committed
to
the
tower
and
there
were
people
found
credulous
and
foolish
enough
to
believe
it
but
english
gratitude
is
always
such
to
hate
the
hand
which
doth
oblige
too
much
these
words
of
daniel
defoe
help
to
explain
something
of
the
attitude
of
a
part
of
the
nation
toward
the
prince
in
his
lifetime
he
had
given
his
life
in
the
service
of
his
wife
and
his
adopted
country
but
he
was
a
and
the
insular
briton
brought
up
in
the
blissful
belief
that
one
englishman
was
as
good
as
three
frenchmen
could
not
and
would
not
overcome
his
distrust
of
one
who
had
not
been
like
himself
so
singularly
blessed
in
his
nationality
but
time
has
its
revenges
and
the
services
of
prince
albert
will
smell
sweet
and
blossom
in
the
dust
long
after
the
very
names
of
once
famous
lights
of
the
victorian
era
have
been
forgotten
his
home
life
was
singularly
sweet
and
happy
and
a
great
contrast
to
that
of
some
of
his
wife
predecessors
upon
the
english
throne
the
queen
writing
to
her
uncle
leopold
in
this
the
year
of
their
marriage
says
few
can
say
with
me
that
their
husband
at
the
end
of
years
is
only
full
of
the
friendship
kindness
and
affection
which
a
truly
happy
marriage
brings
with
it
but
the
same
tender
love
of
the
first
days
of
our
the
prince
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
rejoiced
that
their
marriage
still
continues
green
and
fresh
and
throws
out
vigorous
roots
from
which
i
can
with
gratitude
to
god
acknowledge
that
much
good
will
yet
be
engendered
for
the
world
the
finest
tribute
to
the
prince
consort
memory
is
to
be
found
in
the
dedication
written
by
lord
tennyson
to
his
of
the
these
to
his
memory
since
he
held
them
dear
perchance
as
finding
there
unconsciously
some
image
of
himself
i
dedicate
i
dedicate
i
consecrate
with
tears
these
idylls
like
arthur
flower
of
kings
he
was
a
man
of
ideals
above
petty
jealousies
and
small
ambitions
hereafter
thro
all
times
albert
the
good
the
produced
such
a
deep
impression
upon
the
prince
that
he
wrote
to
the
author
asking
him
to
inscribe
his
name
in
the
volume
the
book
remained
always
a
great
favourite
with
him
and
princess
frederick
william
was
engaged
upon
a
series
of
pictures
illustrating
her
favourite
passages
at
the
time
of
his
death
an
enumeration
of
the
varied
activities
of
prince
albert
during
his
lifetime
would
need
a
volume
his
position
was
always
a
difficult
one
and
was
seldom
made
easier
by
the
section
of
the
press
which
singled
him
out
as
a
target
for
its
poisoned
arrows
only
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
an
unwavering
belief
in
his
wife
love
could
have
sustained
him
through
the
many
dark
hours
of
tribulation
and
sorrow
he
rose
early
all
the
year
round
and
prepared
drafts
of
answers
to
the
queen
ministers
wrote
letters
and
had
cleared
off
a
considerable
amount
of
work
before
many
men
would
have
thought
of
beginning
the
day
tasks
illustration
the
albert
memorial
no
article
of
any
importance
in
the
newspapers
or
magazines
escaped
his
attention
every
one
appealed
to
him
for
help
or
advice
and
none
asked
in
vain
his
wide
knowledge
and
judgment
were
freely
used
by
the
queen
statesmen
and
the
day
proved
all
too
short
for
the
endless
amount
of
work
which
had
to
be
done
in
spite
of
increasing
burdens
and
poor
health
he
was
always
in
good
spirits
at
breakfast
and
at
luncheon
and
also
at
our
family
dinners
he
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
and
kept
us
all
enlivened
by
his
interesting
conversation
by
his
charming
anecdotes
and
droll
stories
without
end
of
his
childhood
of
people
at
coburg
of
our
good
people
in
scotland
which
he
would
repeat
with
a
wonderful
power
of
mimicry
and
at
which
he
would
himself
laugh
most
heartily
then
he
would
at
other
times
entertain
us
with
his
talk
about
the
most
interesting
and
important
topics
of
the
present
and
of
former
days
on
which
it
was
ever
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
speak
footnote
queen
victoria
his
rule
in
life
was
to
make
his
position
entirely
a
part
of
the
queen
to
place
all
his
time
and
powers
at
her
command
every
speech
which
he
made
in
public
was
carefully
considered
beforehand
and
then
written
out
and
committed
to
memory
as
he
had
to
speak
in
a
foreign
tongue
he
considered
this
precaution
absolutely
necessary
at
the
same
time
it
often
made
him
feel
shy
and
nervous
when
speaking
before
strangers
and
this
sometimes
gave
to
those
who
did
not
know
him
a
mistaken
impression
of
coldness
and
reserve
his
sympathy
with
the
working
classes
was
sincere
and
practical
he
was
convinced
that
any
real
improvement
must
be
the
result
of
the
exertion
of
the
working
people
themselves
he
was
president
of
the
society
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
labouring
classes
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
pointing
out
that
to
quote
his
own
words
the
royal
family
are
not
merely
living
upon
the
earnings
of
the
people
as
these
publications
try
to
represent
without
caring
for
the
poor
labourers
but
that
they
are
anxious
about
their
welfare
and
ready
to
in
any
scheme
for
the
amelioration
of
their
condition
we
may
possess
these
feelings
and
yet
the
mass
of
the
people
may
be
ignorant
of
it
because
they
have
never
heard
it
expressed
to
them
or
seen
any
tangible
proof
of
it
his
grasp
of
detail
and
knowledge
of
home
and
foreign
political
affairs
astonished
every
one
who
met
him
ministers
and
ambassadors
alike
his
and
that
of
the
queen
stood
side
by
side
in
their
and
here
they
used
to
work
together
every
dispatch
which
left
their
hands
being
the
joint
work
of
both
the
prince
corrected
and
revised
everything
carefully
before
it
received
the
queen
signature
considering
the
small
amount
of
time
at
his
disposal
it
was
remarkable
how
much
he
was
able
to
read
and
read
thoroughly
both
with
the
queen
and
by
himself
not
many
but
much
was
his
principle
and
every
book
read
was
carefully
noted
in
his
diary
even
to
the
last
he
exerted
his
influence
in
the
cause
of
peace
the
american
civil
war
broke
out
in
and
great
britain
declared
her
neutrality
but
an
incident
known
as
trent
affair
nearly
brought
about
a
declaration
of
war
the
southern
states
or
as
they
were
usually
called
sent
two
commissioners
to
europe
on
board
the
british
mail
steamer
the
was
fired
upon
and
boarded
by
a
federal
officer
who
arrested
the
commissioners
this
was
regarded
as
an
insult
to
our
flag
as
it
was
a
breach
of
international
law
to
attack
the
ship
of
a
neutral
power
the
government
therefore
decided
to
demand
redress
and
a
dispatch
worded
by
palmerston
was
forwarded
to
the
queen
for
her
signature
the
prince
realized
at
once
that
if
the
dispatch
were
forwarded
as
it
was
written
it
would
lead
to
open
war
between
the
northern
states
and
our
country
and
he
suggested
certain
alterations
to
the
queen
who
agreed
to
them
a
more
courteously
worded
message
was
sent
and
the
northern
states
at
once
agreed
to
liberate
the
commissioners
and
offered
an
ample
apology
chapter
xii
and
possibly
the
person
to
whom
the
queen
owed
most
next
to
her
husband
was
lord
melbourne
his
position
at
the
time
when
the
young
queen
came
to
the
throne
was
a
unique
one
victoria
was
just
eighteen
years
of
age
that
is
to
say
if
she
had
been
a
little
younger
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
appoint
a
regent
until
such
time
as
she
came
of
age
for
many
years
it
had
not
been
a
matter
of
certainty
that
she
would
succeed
to
the
throne
and
the
late
king
unreliable
temper
had
been
the
means
of
preventing
the
matter
from
being
properly
arranged
as
regards
certain
advantages
which
might
have
been
given
to
the
princess
during
his
in
many
ways
however
it
was
fortunate
that
the
queen
came
to
the
throne
at
such
an
early
age
if
her
knowledge
of
state
politics
was
small
she
possessed
at
any
rate
a
mind
a
sense
of
duty
and
a
clear
idea
as
to
the
responsibilities
of
her
position
as
ruler
of
a
great
nation
there
had
been
four
reigning
queens
in
this
country
before
victoria
but
all
of
them
had
had
some
previous
training
for
their
duties
the
two
tudor
queens
came
of
a
ruling
stock
and
were
older
in
years
and
experience
the
times
too
were
very
different
queen
elizabeth
for
example
before
coming
to
the
throne
possessed
an
intimate
knowledge
of
political
affairs
and
experience
she
had
been
confined
in
the
tower
of
london
and
narrowly
escaped
losing
her
head
had
endowed
her
with
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
the
two
stuart
queens
were
no
longer
young
and
both
were
married
the
circumstances
in
the
case
of
the
young
victoria
were
thus
totally
different
she
stood
alone
and
it
was
clear
that
some
one
must
help
her
to
grapple
with
the
thousand
and
one
difficulties
which
surrounded
her
it
was
for
some
time
uncertain
who
would
undertake
the
duty
until
almost
before
he
had
realized
it
himself
lord
melbourne
found
himself
in
the
position
of
philosopher
and
friend
how
he
devoted
himself
to
this
work
can
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
no
one
not
even
any
of
his
opponents
regarded
him
with
the
slightest
mistrust
or
jealousy
melbourne
was
at
this
time
years
of
age
an
honourable
englishman
he
was
sympathetic
by
nature
fond
of
female
society
and
in
addition
was
devoted
to
the
queen
his
manner
toward
her
was
always
charming
and
he
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
nor
was
the
training
which
the
queen
received
from
him
limited
to
politics
but
matters
of
private
interest
were
often
discussed
every
morning
he
brought
dispatches
with
him
to
be
read
and
answered
after
the
midday
meal
he
went
out
riding
with
her
and
whenever
his
parliamentary
duties
allowed
he
was
to
be
found
at
her
side
at
the
when
he
retired
from
office
he
was
able
to
state
with
pride
that
he
had
seen
his
sovereign
every
day
during
the
past
four
years
the
news
of
her
engagement
to
prince
albert
was
received
by
him
with
the
keenest
pleasure
and
the
queen
in
writing
to
her
uncle
says
lord
melbourne
whom
i
of
course
have
consulted
about
the
whole
affair
quite
approves
my
choice
and
expresses
great
satisfaction
at
the
event
which
he
thinks
in
every
way
highly
desirable
lord
melbourne
has
acted
in
this
business
as
he
has
always
done
toward
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
affection
it
was
a
real
wrench
to
the
queen
when
the
time
for
parting
came
melbourne
with
his
nature
and
somewhat
free
and
easy
language
had
schooled
himself
as
well
as
his
young
pupil
and
had
become
a
friend
as
well
as
an
adviser
some
words
of
greville
might
aptly
serve
for
this
great
statesman
epitaph
it
has
become
his
providence
to
educate
instruct
and
form
the
most
interesting
mind
and
character
in
the
world
no
occupation
was
ever
more
engrossing
or
involved
greater
responsibility
it
is
fortunate
that
she
has
fallen
into
his
hands
and
that
he
discharges
this
great
duty
wisely
honourably
and
conscientiously
the
queen
was
equally
fortunate
in
his
successor
sir
robert
peel
a
statesman
for
whom
she
had
every
confidence
and
respect
a
man
who
thinks
but
little
of
party
and
never
of
himself
peel
was
never
afraid
of
making
up
his
mind
and
then
sticking
to
his
plan
of
action
although
as
often
happened
it
brought
him
into
opposition
with
members
of
his
own
party
in
his
hands
both
the
queen
and
her
husband
felt
that
the
interests
of
the
crown
were
secure
peel
naturally
felt
considerable
embarrassment
on
first
taking
up
office
as
he
had
given
support
in
the
previous
year
to
a
motion
which
proposed
cutting
down
the
prince
income
but
the
prince
felt
no
resentment
and
so
frank
and
cordial
was
his
manner
that
peel
following
lord
melbourne
lead
continued
to
keep
him
from
day
to
day
thoroughly
in
touch
with
the
course
of
public
affairs
the
relations
between
the
queen
and
her
minister
were
cordial
in
the
extreme
peel
appreciated
very
fully
her
simple
domestic
tastes
and
he
was
able
at
a
later
date
to
bring
before
her
notice
osborne
which
might
serve
as
a
loophole
of
retreat
from
the
noise
and
strife
and
questions
wearisome
the
queen
was
delighted
with
the
estate
it
is
impossible
to
see
a
prettier
place
with
woods
and
valleys
and
de
which
would
be
beautiful
anywhere
but
when
these
are
combined
with
the
sea
to
which
the
woods
grow
down
and
a
beach
which
is
quite
private
it
is
really
everything
one
could
wish
in
the
queen
asked
lord
aberdeen
if
she
could
not
show
in
some
way
her
appreciation
of
the
courage
with
which
sir
robert
peel
had
brought
forward
and
supported
two
great
measures
in
the
face
of
tremendous
opposition
she
suggested
that
he
should
be
offered
the
order
of
the
garter
the
highest
distinction
possible
sir
robert
peel
reply
was
that
he
would
much
prefer
not
to
accept
any
reward
at
all
he
sprang
he
said
from
the
people
and
such
a
great
honour
in
his
case
was
out
of
the
question
the
only
reward
he
asked
for
was
her
majesty
confidence
and
so
long
as
he
possessed
that
he
was
content
when
his
ministry
came
to
an
end
the
prince
wrote
to
him
begging
that
their
relations
should
not
on
that
account
cease
sir
robert
replied
thanking
him
for
the
considerate
kindness
and
indulgence
he
had
received
at
their
hands
and
regretting
that
he
should
no
longer
be
able
to
correspond
so
frequently
as
before
the
prince
and
he
were
in
the
fullest
sympathy
in
matters
of
politics
art
and
literature
and
peel
had
supported
the
prince
loyally
through
all
the
anxieties
connected
with
the
arrangements
for
the
great
exhibition
his
death
in
was
a
calamity
prince
albert
in
a
letter
speaks
of
peel
as
the
best
of
men
our
truest
friend
the
strongest
bulwark
of
the
throne
the
greatest
statesman
of
his
time
the
duke
of
wellington
said
in
the
upper
house
in
all
the
course
of
my
acquaintance
with
sir
robert
peel
i
never
knew
a
man
in
whose
truth
and
justice
i
had
a
more
lively
confidence
or
in
whom
i
saw
a
more
invariable
desire
to
promote
the
public
service
in
the
whole
course
of
my
communications
with
him
i
never
knew
an
instance
in
which
he
did
not
show
the
strongest
attachment
to
truth
and
i
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
the
slightest
reason
for
suspecting
that
he
stated
anything
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
the
fact
the
queen
writing
to
her
uncle
said
that
albert
felt
and
feels
sir
robert
loss
dreadfully
he
feels
he
has
lost
a
second
father
as
a
statesman
it
was
said
of
him
that
for
concocting
producing
explaining
and
defending
measures
he
had
no
equal
or
anything
like
an
equal
by
far
the
most
interesting
person
who
acted
as
both
friend
and
adviser
to
the
queen
and
her
husband
was
the
baron
christian
friedrich
von
stockmar
who
had
been
private
physician
to
prince
leopold
and
afterward
private
secretary
and
controller
of
his
household
he
took
an
active
part
in
the
negotiations
which
led
to
his
master
becoming
king
of
the
belgians
long
residence
in
this
country
had
given
him
a
thorough
knowledge
of
england
and
the
english
and
he
claimed
friendship
with
the
leading
diplomatists
both
at
home
and
on
the
european
continent
in
he
retired
to
coburg
but
later
was
chosen
as
we
have
seen
to
lend
his
valuable
advice
toward
bringing
about
a
union
between
prince
albert
and
queen
victoria
both
of
whom
he
knew
and
admired
immediately
before
victoria
accession
king
leopold
had
sent
him
to
england
where
his
counsel
judgment
and
thorough
knowledge
of
the
english
constitution
were
placed
at
the
service
of
the
young
princess
he
accompanied
prince
albert
on
a
tour
in
italy
and
again
returned
to
england
to
make
arrangements
for
the
prince
future
household
all
that
he
did
during
this
period
was
done
quietly
and
behind
the
scenes
and
though
he
was
a
foreigner
by
birth
he
worked
to
bring
about
the
marriage
for
the
sake
of
the
country
he
loved
so
well
he
looked
upon
england
as
the
home
of
political
freedom
out
of
its
bosom
he
stated
singly
and
solely
has
sprung
america
free
constitution
in
all
its
present
power
and
importance
in
its
incalculable
influence
upon
the
social
condition
of
the
whole
human
race
and
in
my
eyes
the
english
constitution
is
the
and
of
the
entire
political
civilization
of
the
human
race
present
and
to
come
he
soon
became
the
prince
confidential
adviser
and
his
unrivalled
knowledge
and
strict
sense
of
truth
and
duty
proved
of
the
utmost
value
he
endeared
himself
to
both
the
queen
and
the
prince
and
successive
statesmen
trusted
him
absolutely
for
his
freedom
from
prejudice
and
for
his
sincerity
in
he
drew
up
for
the
queen
some
rules
for
the
education
of
her
children
a
man
education
begins
the
first
day
of
his
life
was
one
of
his
maxims
he
insisted
that
the
education
of
the
royal
infants
ought
to
be
from
its
earliest
beginning
truly
moral
and
a
truly
english
the
persons
to
whom
the
children
are
entrusted
should
receive
the
full
support
and
confidence
of
the
parents
otherwise
education
lacks
its
very
soul
and
vitality
he
suggested
that
a
lady
of
rank
should
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
nursery
as
being
better
able
to
understand
the
responsibilities
and
duties
attached
to
the
education
and
upbringing
of
the
queen
children
his
advice
was
again
taken
when
it
was
necessary
to
settle
upon
what
plan
the
young
prince
of
wales
should
be
educated
stockmar
judgment
of
men
was
singularly
correct
and
just
he
formed
the
highest
opinion
of
sir
robert
peel
and
on
the
duke
of
wellington
death
in
he
wrote
in
a
letter
to
the
prince
a
masterly
analysis
of
the
great
commander
character
concluding
with
these
words
as
the
times
we
live
in
can
not
fail
to
present
your
royal
highness
with
great
and
worthy
occasions
to
distinguish
yourself
you
should
not
shrink
from
turning
them
to
account
as
wellington
did
for
the
good
of
all
yet
without
detriment
to
yourself
the
prince
corresponded
regularly
with
good
stockmar
and
always
in
time
of
doubt
and
trial
came
sage
counsel
from
his
trusted
friend
in
fact
the
prince
took
both
the
queen
and
his
friend
equally
into
his
confidence
they
were
the
two
to
whom
he
could
unbosom
himself
with
entire
freedom
disraeli
afterward
lord
beaconsfield
obtained
the
queen
fullest
confidence
and
won
her
friendship
to
an
extent
which
no
minister
since
melbourne
had
ever
been
able
to
do
the
leader
of
the
england
party
the
writer
of
political
novels
was
a
very
different
person
from
the
statesman
of
later
years
it
is
difficult
to
remember
or
to
realize
in
these
days
that
it
was
looked
upon
as
something
quite
extraordinary
for
a
member
of
a
once
despised
and
persecuted
race
the
jews
to
hold
high
office
the
annual
celebrations
of
day
april
the
anniversary
of
his
death
are
sufficient
proof
that
this
great
statesman
services
to
the
british
empire
are
not
yet
forgotten
lord
beaconsfield
whom
she
regarded
with
sincere
affection
possessed
a
remarkable
influence
over
the
queen
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
never
forgot
to
treat
her
as
a
woman
he
was
noted
throughout
his
life
for
his
chivalry
to
the
opposite
sex
and
his
devotion
to
his
wife
was
very
touching
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
power
of
the
crown
for
good
the
proper
leader
of
the
people
he
declared
is
the
individual
who
sits
upon
the
throne
he
wished
the
sovereign
to
be
in
a
position
to
rule
as
well
as
to
reign
to
be
at
one
with
the
nation
above
the
quarrels
and
differences
of
the
political
parties
and
to
be
their
representative
when
quite
a
young
man
he
declared
that
he
would
one
day
be
prime
minister
and
with
this
end
in
view
he
entered
parliament
against
the
wishes
of
his
family
he
was
an
untiring
worker
all
his
life
and
a
firm
believer
in
action
act
act
act
without
ceasing
and
you
will
no
longer
talk
of
the
vanity
of
life
was
his
creed
his
ideas
on
education
were
original
and
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
improve
the
training
of
the
young
in
he
supported
the
great
measure
for
a
scheme
of
national
education
some
years
earlier
he
declared
that
it
is
an
absolute
necessity
that
we
should
study
to
make
every
man
the
most
effective
being
that
education
can
possibly
constitute
him
in
the
old
wars
there
used
to
be
a
story
that
one
englishman
could
beat
three
members
of
some
other
nation
but
i
think
if
we
want
to
maintain
our
power
we
ought
to
make
one
englishman
equal
really
in
the
business
of
life
to
three
other
men
that
any
other
nation
can
furnish
i
do
not
see
otherwise
how
we
can
fulfil
the
great
destiny
that
i
believe
awaits
us
and
the
great
position
we
occupy
he
did
more
than
any
other
minister
to
raise
the
crown
to
the
position
it
now
occupies
and
no
monarch
ever
had
a
more
devoted
and
faithful
servant
his
high
standard
of
morals
and
his
force
of
character
especially
appealed
to
the
english
people
and
his
loyalty
to
his
friends
and
colleagues
remained
unshaken
throughout
his
whole
life
he
impressed
not
only
his
own
countrymen
but
also
foreigners
with
his
splendid
gifts
of
imagination
and
foresight
bismarck

he
knew
how
to
interpret
the
queen
wishes
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
herself
yet
he
did
not
hesitate
when
he
thought
it
advisable
to
speak
quite
freely
in
criticism
of
her
actions
his
ancestors
in
the
bedford
family
had
in
olden
days
been
advisers
of
the
crown
and
lord

came
of

stock

himself
nevertheless
was
always
alert
to
prevent
any
encroachment
upon
the
growing
powers
and
rights
of

he
was
a
favourite
of
the
queen
and
she
gave
him
as
a
residence
a
house
and

in

he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
an
agreeable
talker
very
well
read
fond
of
quoting

and
especially
pleased
if
he
could
indulge
in
reminiscences
in
his
own
circle
of
what
his
royal
mistress
had
said
at
her
last
visit
finally
mention
must
be
made
of
one
who
though
he
held
no
high
position
of

can
with
justice
be
regarded
as
both
friend
and
adviser
of
the

not

at
times
from

in

of
his
rough
manner
he
possessed
many
admirable
qualities

on

come

necessity
for
guarding

part

has
been
created

only
the
last
hundred

beaconsfield
in
his
novel
describes
the
difference
between
ancient
and
modern
colonies
a
modern
colony
he
says
is
a
commercial
enterprise
an
ancient
colony
was
a
political
sentiment
in
other
words
colonies
were
a
matter
of
to
modern
nations
such
as
the
spaniards
in
the
time
of
the
ancients
there
was
a
close
tie
a
feeling
of
kinship
and
the
colonist
was
not
looked
upon
with
considerable
contempt
and
dislike
by
the
mother
country
beaconsfield
believed
that
there
would
come
a
time
and
that
not
far
distant
when
men
would
change
their
ideas
i
believe
that
a
great
revolution
is
at
hand
in
our
system
of
colonization
and
that
europe
will
soon
recur
to
the
principles
of
the
ancient
polity
this
feeling
of
pride
in
the
growth
and
expansion
of
our
great
dominions
is
comparatively
new
and
there
was
a
time
when
british
ministers
seriously
proposed
separation
from
what
they
considered
to
be
a
useless
burden
the
ignorance
of
all
that
concerned
the
colonies
in
the
early
years
of
victoria
reign
was
extraordinary
and
this
accounted
to
a
great
extent
for
the
indifference
with
which
the
english
people
regarded
the
prospect
of
drifting
apart
lord
beaconsfield
was
a
true
prophet
for
this
indifference
is
now
a
thing
of
the
past
and
in
the
year
an
imperial
federation
league
was
formed
which
together
with
the
celebrations
at
the
jubilees
in
and
helped
to
knit
this
country
and
the
dominions
together
in
bonds
of
friendship
and
sympathy
the
rapid
improvements
in
communication
have
brought
the
different
parts
of
the
empire
closer
together
the
imperial
penny
postage
and
an
cable
route
to
australia
have
kept
us
in
constant
touch
with
our
kinsmen
in
every
part
of
the
world
where
the
union
jack
is
flown
but
this
did
not
all
come
about
in
a
day
prejudice
and
dislike
are
difficult
to
conquer
and
it
was
chiefly
owing
to
the
efforts
of
lord
beaconsfield
that
they
were
eventually
overcome
imperialism
too
often
means
wild
waving
of
flags
and
chanting
of
such
melodies
as
we
do
want
to
fight
but
by
jingo
if
we
do
we
got
the
ships
we
got
the
men
we
got
the
money
too
the
true
imperialism
is
defence
not
defiance
beaconsfield
looked
back
into
the
past
and
sought
to
resume
the
thread
of
our
ancient
empire
for
him
empire
meant
no
easy
burden
but
a
solemn
duty
a
knitting
together
of
all
the
varied
races
and
religions
in
one
common
cause
peace
with
honour
was
his
and
england
watchword
he
believed
in
fact
like
shakespeare
in
saying
beware
of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
that
th
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
he
was
very
particular
on
the
duty
of
if
necessary
saying
rough
things
kindly
and
not
kind
things
roughly
which
was
a
lesson
lord
palmerston
never
seemed
to
be
capable
of
learning
another
of
his
maxims
was
that
it
was
wiser
from
every
point
of
view
to
treat
nations
with
due
respect
for
their
customs
and
feelings
he
preached
confederation
and
not
annexation
by
pursuing
the
policy
of
confederation
he
declared
we
bind
states
together
we
consolidate
their
resources
and
we
enable
them
to
establish
a
strong
frontier
that
is
the
best
security
against
annexation
his
whole
policy
was
to
foster
the
growth
of
independence
and
build
the
foundations
of
a
peace
which
should
be
enduring
both
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
our
object
is
to
have
prosperous
happy
and
contented
neighbours
the
object
of
his
imperialism
was
to
progress
at
the
same
time
paying
due
respect
to
the
traditions
of
the
past
he
rightly
believed
that
the
character
of
a
nation
like
that
of
an
individual
is
strengthened
by
responsibility
the
glory
of
the
empire
and
the
prosperity
of
the
people
was
what
he
hoped
to
achieve
during
the
anxious
times
of
the
indian
mutiny
he
alone
seemed
to
grasp
the
real
meaning
of
this
sudden
uprising
of
alien
races
he
declared
that
it
was
a
revolt
and
not
a
mutiny
a
revolt
against
the
english
because
of
their
lack
of
respect
for
ancient
rights
and
customs
after
the
war
was
ended
he
declared
that
the
government
ought
to
tell
the
people
of
india
that
the
relation
between
them
and
their
real
ruler
and
sovereign
queen
victoria
shall
be
drawn
nearer
this
should
be
done
in
the
queen
name
and
with
the
queen
authority
he
appealed
to
the
whole
indian
nation
by
his
titles
bill
by
means
of
which
the
queen
received
the
title
of
empress
of
india
this
brought
home
to
the
minds
and
imaginations
of
the
native
races
the
real
meaning
and
grandeur
of
the
empire
of
which
they
were
now
a
part
the
great
queen
was
now
empress
or
to
use
the
indian
title
the
queen
took
the
deepest
interest
in
the

assuming
the

giving
them
pledges

her

the
expressions

loyalty
and
devotion
from
the
representatives
of
the
great

on
the
occasion
of
the

jubilee
in
were
proof
enough
that
england
and
the
english
were
no
longer
an
insular
land
and
people
but
a
mighty
nation
with
one
sovereign
head
in
the
address
which
was
presented
to
the
queen
it
was
stated
that
during
her
reign
her
colonial
subjects
of
european
descent
had
increased
from
two
to
nine
millions
and
in
asia
and
india
there
was
an
increase
of
population
from
to
two
hundred
and
millions
after
the
great
ceremony
of
thanksgiving
in
st

cathedral
the
queen
expressed
her
thanks
to
her
people
in
the
following
message
i
am
anxious
to
express
to
my
people
my
warm
thanks
for
the
kind
and
more
than
kind
reception
i
met
with
on
going
to
and
returning
from
westminster
abbey
with
all
my
children
and
grandchildren
the
enthusiastic
reception
i
met
with
then
as
well
as
on
those
eventful
days
in
london
as
well
as
in
windsor
on
the
occasion
of
my
jubilee
has
touched
me
most
deeply
and
has
shown
that
the
labours
and
anxieties
of
fifty
long
years
years
of
which
i
spent
in
unclouded
happiness
shared
with
and
cheered
by
my
beloved
husband
while
an
equal
number
were
full
of
sorrows
and
trial
borne
without
his
sheltering
arm
and
wise
help
have
been
appreciated
by
my
people
this
feeling
and
the
sense
of
duty
towards
my
dear
country
and
subjects
who
are
so
inseparably
bound
up
with
my
life
will
encourage
me
in
my
task
often
a
very
difficult
and
arduous
one
during
the
remainder
of
my
life
the
wonderful
order
preserved
on
this
occasion
and
the
good
behaviour
of
the
enormous
multitudes
assembled
merits
my
highest
admiration
that
god
may
protect
and
abundantly
bless
my
country
is
my
fervent
prayer
and
in
laying
the
of
the
imperial
institute
she
said
i
concur
with
you
in
thinking
that
the
counsel
and
exertions
of
my
beloved
husband
initiated
a
movement
which
gave
increased
vigour
to
commercial
activity
and
produced
marked
and
lasting
improvements
in
industrial
efforts
one
indirect
result
of
that
movement
has
been
to
bring
more
before
the
minds
of
men
the
vast
and
varied
resources
of
the
empire
over
which
providence
has
willed
that
i
should
reign
during
fifty
prosperous
years
i
believe
and
hope
that
the
imperial
institute
will
play
a
useful
part
in
combining
those
resources
for
the
common
advantage
of
all
my
subjects

towards
the
welding
of
the
colonies
india
and
the
into

revolution
was

but
it
worked
vast
and
almost
incredible
changes
we
find
in
the
first
place
that
after
the
great
napoleonic
wars
and
during
the
years
peace
a
new
class
the
class
came
into
being
it
had
of
course
existed
before
this
time
but
it
had
been
unable
to
make
its
power
felt
the
astonishing
increase
of
trade
and
consequently
of
wealth
the
application
of
steam
power
with
special
influence
upon
land
and
sea
transit
transformed
england
into
the
workshop
of
the
world
by
the
year
railways
were
no
longer
regarded
as
something
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment
which
might
or
might
not
prove
a
success
they
had
indeed
become
an
integral
part
of
the
social
life
of
the
nation
in
the
railway
regulation
act
was
passed
followed
in
by
the
cheap
trains
act
which
required
that
passengers
must
be
carried
in
covered
waggons
at
a
charge
of
not
more
than
one
penny
a
mile
and
at
a
speed
of
not
less
than
twelve
miles

from
onward
the
construction
of

proceeded
apace

by

a
powerful
commercial
class
came
into
existence
and
power
that
is
voting
power
passed
to
this
class
and
was
held
by
it
until
the
year
from
this
year
roughly
speaking
the
power
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
democracy
education
which
had
been
to
a
great
extent
a
class
monopoly
gradually
penetrated
to
all
ranks
and
grades
of
society
in
the
second
reform
act
was
passed
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
urban
working
classes
were
given
the
power
of
voting
and
it
was
naturally
impossible
to
entrust
such
powers
for
long
to
an
illiterate
democracy
therefore
in
mr
forster
education
act
was
passed
which
required
that
in
every
district
where
sufficient
voluntary
schools
did
not
exist
a
school
board
should
be
formed
to
build
and
maintain
the
necessary
school
accommodation
at
the
cost
of
the
rates
by
a
later
act
of
school
attendance
was
made
compulsory
every
effort
was
made
in
succeeding
years
to
raise
the
level
of
intelligence
among
present
and
future
citizens
education
became
national
and
universal
during
the
period
the
population
of
the
kingdom
increased
and
the
emigration
to
the
british
colonial
possessions
reached
its
maximum
in
the
year
when
the
figures
were
the
rapid
rise
in
population
of
the
large
towns
drew
attention
more
and
more
urgently
to
the
question
of
public
health
every
city
and
every
town
had
its
own
problems
to
face
and
the
necessity
for
solving
these
cultivated
and
strengthened
the
sense
of
civic
pride
and
responsibility
we
find
during
this
period
an
interest
throughout
the
country
in
the
welfare
both
moral
and
mental
of
the
great
mass
of
the
workers

and
finally
carried
on
the
great
and
important
work
of

its
citizens
the
power

at
last
to
make
itself
felt
the
first
attempt
at
made
by
the
rochdale
pioneers
in
stimulated
others
to
follow
their
example
and
in
the

was
formed

showed
an
increased
interest
in

in
forming

and
in
extending

somewhat
narrow
policy

their

increased

attached
to

carrying
on

educational
and
beneficial
amongst
its
members
the
standard
of
society
was
continually
rising
and
it
was
already
a
far
cry
to
the
early
victorian
england
described
in
an
earlier
chapter
the
world
was
growing
smaller
that
is
to
say
communications
between
country
and
country
between
continent
and
continent
were
growing
more
easy
the
first
insulated
cable
was
laid
in
across
the
hudson
river
from
jersey
city
to
new
york
and
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
was
made
to
connect
the
new
and
the
old
world
in
the
after
two
trials
succeeded
in
laying
a
complete
cable
the
expansion
of
the
powers
of
human
invention
led
to
a
great
increase
in
the
growth
of
comfort
of
all
classes
to
take
only
a
few
striking
examples
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
matches
were
not
yet
invented
and
only
in
were
the
sulphur
matches
put
on
the
market
they
were
sold
at
the
rate
of
one
shilling
a
box
containing
matches
in
the
year
gas
was
still
considered
a
luxury
soap
and
candles
were
both
greatly
improved
and
cheapened
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
window
tax
in
obvious
and
necessary
advantages
were
gained
in
the
building
of
houses
in
the
stamp
duty
on
newspapers
was
abolished
in
these
days
of
cheap
halfpenny
papers
with
immense
circulations
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
at
a
date
not
very
far
distant
from
us
the
poor
scarcely
if
ever
saw
a
newspaper
at
all
friends
used
to
club
together
to
reduce
the
great
expense
of
buying
a
single
copy
and
agents
hired
out
copies
for
the
sum
of
one
penny
per
hour
the
only
effect
of
the
stamp
duty
had
been
to
cut
off
the
poorer
classes
from
all
sources
of
trustworthy
information
in
not
a
single
town
in
the
kingdom
with
the
exception
of
london
possessed
a
daily
paper
the
invention
of
steam
printing
and
the
introduction
of
shorthand
reporting
and
the
use
of
telegraph
and
railways
revolutionized
the
whole
world
of
journalism
charles
dickens
on
the
occasion
of
his
presiding
in
may
at
the
second
annual
dinner
of
the
newspaper
press
fund
gave
his
hearers
an
idea
of
what
newspaper
reporters
were
and
what
they
suffered
in
the
early
days
i
have
pursued
the
calling
of
a
reporter
under
circumstances
of
which
many
of
my
brethren
here
can
form
no
adequate
conception
i
have
often
transcribed
for
the
printer
from
my
shorthand
notes
important
public
speeches
in
which
the
strictest
accuracy
was
required
and
a
mistake
in
which
would
have
been
to
a
young
man
severely
compromising
writing
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
by
the
light
of
a
dark
lantern
in
a
and
four
galloping
through
a
wild
country
and
through
the
dead
of
the
night
at
the
then
surprising
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
i
have
worn
my
knees
by
writing
on
them
on
the
old
of
the
old
gallery
of
the
old
house
of
commons
and
i
have
worn
my
feet
by
standing
to
write
in
a
preposterous
pen
in
the
old
house
of
lords
where
we
used
to
be
huddled
together
like
so
many
sheep
kept
in
waiting
say
until
the
woolsack
might
want
returning
home
from
exciting
political
meetings
in
the
country
to
the
waiting
press
in
london
i
do
verily
believe
i
have
been
upset
in
almost
every
description
of
vehicle
known
in
this
country
i
have
been
in
my
time
belated
on
miry
towards
the
small
hours
forty
or
fifty
miles
from
london
in
a
wheelless
carriage
with
exhausted
horses
and
drunken
and
have
got
back
in
time
for
publication
to
be
received
with
compliments
by
the
late
mr
black
coming
in
the
broadest
of
scotch
from
the
broadest
of
hearts
i
ever
knew
during
these
later
years
england
came
to
look
upon
her
duties
and
responsibilities
toward
her
colonial
possessions
in
quite
a
different
light
imperialism
became
a
factor
in
the
political
life
of
the
nation
the
builders
of
empire
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
took
a
very
narrow
view
of
their
responsibilities
they
were
not
in
the
least
degree
concerned
about
the
of
a
colony
or
possession
for
its
own
sake
the
state
of
ireland
in
those
days
spoke
for
itself
the
horrors
of
the
indian
mutiny
in
was
the
first
lesson
which
opened
england
eyes
to
the
fact
that
an
empire
if
it
is
to
be
anything
more
than
a
name
must
be
a
united
whole
under
wise
and
sympathetic
guidance
the
rebellion
proved
to
be
the
end
of
the
old
east
indian
company
england
took
over
the
administration
of
indian
affairs
into
her
own
hands
an
act
for
the
better
government
of
india
was
passed
in
which
provided
that
all
the
territories
previously
under
the
government
of
the
company
were
to
be
vested
in
her
majesty
and
all
the
company
powers
to
be
exercised
in
her
name
the
viceroy
with
the
assistance
of
a
council
was
to
be
supreme
in
india
in
a
great
colonial
reform
was
carried
out
the
confederation
of
the
north
american
provinces
of
the
british
empire
by
this
act
the
names
of
upper
and
lower
canada
were
changed
respectively
to
ontario
and
quebec
the
first
dominion
parliament
met
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
and
lost
no
time
in
passing
an
act
to
construct
an
railway
affording
proper
means
of
communication
between
the
maritime
and
central
provinces
in
the
hudson
bay
territory
was
acquired
from
the
company
which
held
it
and
after
the
red
river
insurrection
headed
by
a
louis
riel
had
been
successfully
crushed
by
the
wolseley
expedition
the
territory
was
made
part
of
the
federation
in
british
columbia
became
part
of
the
dominion
on
condition
that
a
railway
was
constructed
within
the
following
ten
years
which
should
extend
from
the
pacific
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
connect
with
the
existing
railway
system
the
great
canadian
pacific
railway
was
completed
in
opening
out
the
west
to
the
rise
and
growth
of
the
imperialistic
spirit
has
been
greatly
influenced
by
the
literature
on
the
subject
which
dated
its
commencement
from
professor
seeley
of
in
this
was
followed
by
an
immense
number
of
works
by
various
writers
the
chief
of
whom
rudyard
kipling
has
popularized
the
conception
of
imperialism
and
extended
its
meaning
never
was
isle
so
little
never
was
sea
so
lone
but
over
the
scud
and
the
an
english
flag
was
flown
the
empire
was
not
however
to
be
consolidated
without
war
and
bloodshed
for
relations
with
the
two
boer
republics
the
transvaal
and
the
orange
river
became
more
and
more
strained
as
years
went
on
the
last
years
of
the
queen
life
were
destined
to
be
saddened
by
the
outbreak
of
war
in
south
africa
the
facts
which
led
to
the
outbreak
were
briefly
these
though
it
is
but
fair
to
state
that
there
are
even
now
various
theories
current
as
to
the
causes
the
discovery
and
opening
up
of
the
gold
mines
of
the
transvaal
had
brought
a
stream
of
adventurous
emigrants
into
the
country
and
it
was
these
of
whom
the
dutch
were
suspicious
the
transvaal
government
refused
to
admit
them
to
equal
political
rights
with
the
dutch
inhabitants
it
was
certain
however
that
the
outlanders
would
never
submit
to
be
dependent
on
the
policy
of
president
kruger
although
the
dutch
declared
that
they
had
only
accepted
the
suzerainty
of
great
britain
under
compulsion
negotiations
between
the
two
governments
led
to
nothing
as
neither
side
would
give
way
and
at
last
in
following
upon
an
ultimatum
demanding
the
withdrawal
of
british
troops
from
the
borders
of
the
republic
war
broke
out
it
had
undoubtedly
been
hastened
by
the
and
raid
in
of
dr
jameson
the
administrator
of
rhodesia
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
review
the
details
of
this
war
at
any
length
it
proved
conclusively
that
the
government
of
this
country
had
vastly
underrated
the
resisting
powers
of
the
boers
for
three
years
the
british
army
was
forced
to
wage
a
guerilla
warfare
and
adapt
itself
to
entirely
new
methods
of
campaigning
on
may
the
orange
free
state
was
annexed
under
the
name
of
the
orange
river
colony
in
june
lord
roberts
entered
pretoria
but
the
war
dragged
on
until
when
a
peace
conference
was
held
and
the
boer
republics
became
part
of
the
british
empire
very
liberal
terms
were
offered
to
and
accepted
by
the
conquered
dutch
but
long
before
this
event
took
place
queen
victoria
had
passed
away
she
had
followed
the
whole
course
of
the
war
with
the
deepest
interest
and
anxiety
and
when
lord
roberts
returned
to
this
country
leaving
lord
kitchener
in
command
in
south
africa
the
queen
was
desirous
of
hearing
from
his
own
lips
the
story
of
the
campaign
the
public
was
already
uneasy
about
the
state
of
her
health
and
on
january
it
was
announced
that
her
condition
had
become
serious
on
tuesday
january
she
was
conscious
and
recognized
the
members
of
her
family
watching
by
her
bedside
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
she
peacefully
passed
away
one
of
the
last
wishes
she
expressed
was
that
her
body
should
be
borne
to
rest
on
a
for
she
had
never
forgotten
that
she
was
a
soldier
daughter
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
horses
attached
to
the
became
restive
and
the
sailors
who
formed
the
guard
of
honour
took
their
place
and
drew
the
coffin
draped
in
the
union
jack
to
its
last
through
the
streets
of
london
which
had
witnessed
two
great
jubilee
processions
festivals
of
rejoicing
and
thanksgiving
the
funeral
cortege
passed
and
a
great
reign
and
a
great
epoch
in
history
had
come
to
an
end
chapter
xv
the
the
keynote
of
queen
victoria
life
was
simplicity
she
was
a
great
ruler
and
at
the
same
time
a
sympathetic
woman
the
true
mother
of
her
people
she
seemed
by
some
natural
instinct
to
understand
their
joys
and
their
sorrows
and
this
was
the
more
remarkable
as
for
forty
years
she
reigned
alone
without
the
invaluable
advice
and
assistance
of
her
husband
her
qualities
were
not
those
which
have
made
other
great
rulers
famous
but
they
were
typical
of
the
age
in
which
she
lived
all
her
life
she
was
industrious
and
never
spared
herself
any
time
or
trouble
however
arduous
and
disagreeable
her
duties
might
be
she
possessed
the
keenest
sense
of
duty
and
in
dealing
with
men
and
circumstances
she
never
failed
to
do
or
say
the
right
thing
her
daily
intercourse
with
the
leading
english
statesmen
of
the
time
gave
her
an
unrivalled
knowledge
of
home
and
foreign
politics
in
short
her
natural
ability
and
good
sense
strengthened
by
experience
made
her
what
she
was
a
perfect
model
of
a
constitutional
monarch
during
her
reign
the
crown
once
again
took
its
proper
place
no
longer
was
there
a
gulf
between
the
ruler
and
the
people
and
patriotism
the
love
of
queen
and
country
became
a
real
and
living
thing
adage
a
patriot
is
a
fool
in
every
age
could
no
longer
be
quoted
with
any
truth
queen
victoria
was
above
all
a
great
lover
of
peace
and
did
all
in
her
power
for
its
promotion
her
personal
influence
was
often
the
means
of
smoothing
over
difficulties
both
at
home
and
abroad
when
her
ministers
had
aggravated
instead
of
lessening
them
she
formed
her
own
opinions
and
held
to
them
though
she
was
always
willing
to
listen
to
reason
the
memorandum
which
she
drew
up
in
the
year
shows
how
firm
a
stand
she
could
take
when
her
country
peace
seemed
to
be
threatened
lord
palmerston
though
an
able
minister
in
many
respects
was
a
wilful
man
who
was
of
acting
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
consulting
his
sovereign
his
dispatches
written
as
they
so
often
were
in
a
moment
of
feverish
enthusiasm
frequently
gave
offence
to
foreign
monarchs
and
statesmen
and
were
more
than
once
nearly
the
cause
of
war
it
was
remarked
of
him
that
the
desk
was
his
place
of
peril
his
pen
ran
away
with
him
his
speech
never
made
an
enemy
his
writing
has
left
many
festering
sores
the
charm
of
manner
and
urbanity
which
so
served
him
in
parliament
and
in
society
was
sometimes
wanting
on
paper
and
good
counsels
were
dashed
with
asperity
lord
palmerston
the
queen
complained
did
not
obey
instructions
and
she
declared
that
before
important
dispatches
were
sent
abroad
the
sovereign
should
be
consulted
further
alterations
were
sometimes
made
by
him
when
they
had
been
neither
suggested
nor
approved
by
the
crown
such
proceedings
caused
england
in
the
queen
own
words
to
be
generally
detested
mistrusted
and
treated
with
indignity
by
even
the
smallest
powers
in
the
memorandum
the
queen
requires
that
he
will
distinctly
state
what
he
proposes
in
a
given
case
in
order
that
the
queen
may
know
as
distinctly
to
what
she
has
given
her
royal
sanction
having
once
given
her
sanction
to
a
measure
that
it
be
not
arbitrarily
altered
or
modified
by
the
minister
such
an
act
she
must
consider
as
a
failure
in
sincerity
towards
the
crown
and
justly
to
be
visited
by
the
exercise
of
her
constitutional
right
of
dismissing
that
minister
she
expects
to
be
kept
informed
of
what
passes
between
him
and
the
foreign
ministers
before
important
decisions
are
taken
based
upon
that
intercourse
to
receive
the
foreign
dispatches
in
good
time
and
to
have
the
drafts
for
her
approval
sent
to
her
in
sufficient
time
to
make
herself
acquainted
with
their
contents
before
they
must
be
sent
off
the
queen
thinks
it
best
that
lord
john
russell
should
show
this
letter
to
lord
palmerston
more
than
once
the
alteration
of
a
dispatch
by
the
queen
prevented
what
might
easily
have
plunged
this
country
into
a
disastrous
war
after
the
mutiny
in
india
a
proclamation
was
issued
to
the
native
races
and
the
queen
insisted
upon
alterations
which
would
clearly
show
that
their
religious
beliefs
should
in
no
way
be
interfered
with
thus
preventing
a
fresh
mutiny
on
rare
occasions
her
indignation
got
the
better
of
her
once
notably
when
owing
to
careless
delay
on
the
part
of
the
ministry
general
gordon
perished
at
khartoum
a
rescue
party
failing
to
reach
him
in
time
in
a
letter
to
his
sisters
she
spoke
of
this
as
a
stain
left
upon
england
and
as
a
wrong
which
she
felt
very
keenly
her
style
of
writing
was
as
simple
as
possible
yet
she
always
said
the
right
thing
at
the
right
moment
and
her
letters
of
sympathy
or
congratulation
were
models
of
their
kind
and
never
failed
in
their
effect
few
if
any
reigns
in
history
have
been
so
blameless
as
hers
and
her
domestic
life
was
perfect
in
its
harmony
and
the
devotion
of
the
members
of
her
family
to
one
another
she
possessed
the
of
the
mistress
for
every
detail
however
small
which
concerned
housekeeping
matters
and
though
her
style
of
entertaining
was
naturally
often
magnificent
everything
was
paid
for
punctually
after
the
visits
of
king
louis
philippe
and
the
emperor
nicholas
of
russia
sir
robert
peel
acknowledged
that
her
majesty
was
able
to
meet
every
charge
and
to
give
a
reception
to
the
sovereigns
which
struck
every
one
by
its
magnificence
without
adding
one
tittle
to
the
burdens
of
the
country
i
am
not
required
by
her
majesty
to
press
for
the
extra
expenditure
of
one
single
shilling
on
account
of
these
unforeseen
causes
of
increased
expenditure
i
think
that
to
state
this
is
only
due
to
the
personal
credit
of
her
majesty
who
insists
upon
it
that
there
shall
be
every
magnificence
required
by
her
station
but
without
incurring
one
single
debt
when
one
remembers
that
the
queen
had
to
superintend
the
household
arrangements
of
buckingham
palace
balmoral
castle
osborne
and
windsor
and
that
the
latter
alone
gave
employment
in
one
way
and
another
to
two
thousand
people
it
can
be
realized
that
this
was
a
tremendous
undertaking
in
itself
method
and
neatness
first
instituted
by
the
prince
consort
were
always
insisted
upon
in
place
of
the
disorder
and
waste
which
had
reigned
supreme
before
the
queen
became
head
of
the
household
illustration
the
victoria
and
albert
museum
south
kensington
before
her
life
was
saddened
by
the
untimely
loss
of
her
husband
the
queen
was
the
leader
of
english
society
and
her
influence
was
as
may
be
imagined
thoroughly
wholesome
and
good
she
was
all
her
life
a
deeply
religious
woman
and
though
her
observance
of
sunday
was
strict
she
never
allowed
it
to
become
a
day
of
penance
her
religion
was
indeed
her
intense
sympathy
with
all
sorrow
and
suffering
was
one
of
her
supreme
virtues
and
her
early
upbringing
made
her
dislike
all
elaborate
forms
of
ceremony
during
the
service
when
in
the
highlands
she
always
attended
the
simple
little
presbyterian
church
where
the
congregation
was
for
the
most
part
made
up
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
it
is
this
simplicity
and
of
the
queen
which
were
so
often
misunderstood
by
those
who
could
not
realize
how
much
she
was
at
one
with
her
people
the
queen
was
never
more
happy
than
when
she
was
visiting
some
poor
sufferer
and
comforting
those
in
sorrow
her
memory
for
the
little
events
which
made
up
the
lives
and
happiness
of
those
far
below
her
in
social
rank
was
amazing
she
was
a
great
and
a
truly
democratic
queen
she
gave
the
greater
portion
of
her
jubilee
present
toward
a
fund
to
establish
institutions
to
provide
nurses
for
the
sick
poor
during
the
latter
years
of
her
reign
when
she
was
less
and
less
to
be
seen
at
public
functions
and
ceremonies
many
complaints
were
made
about
her
reputed
neglect
of
royal
duties
she
felt
the
injustice
of
such
statements
very
keenly
and
with
good
reason
no
allowances
were
made
for
her
poor
health
for
her
years
for
the
family
losses
which
left
her
every
year
more
and
more
a
lonely
woman
her
duties
ever
increasing
in
number
and
extent
left
her
no
time
even
if
she
had
possessed
the
inclination
to
take
part
in
pomp
and
ceremony
the
outburst
of
loyalty
and
affection
on
the
occasion
of
her
two
jubilee
celebrations
proved
that
she
still
reigned
supreme
in
the
nation
heart
the
queen
was
not
only
a
great
monarch
but
also
a
great
statesman
consider
for
a
moment
the
many
and
bewildering
changes
which
took
place
in
her
own
and
other
countries
during
her
reign
our
country
was
almost
continually
at
war
in
some
portion
of
the
globe
the
british
army
fought
side
by
side
with
the
french
against
russia
in
the
crimea
and
against
the
rebels
in
the
indian
mutiny
two
boer
wars
were
fought
in
south
africa
in
and
there
were
also
lesser
wars
in
china
afghanistan
abyssinia
zululand
and
egypt
the
queen
lived
to
see
france
change
from
a
monarchy
to
a
republic
to
see
germany
beat
france
to
her
knees
and
become
a
united
empire
thanks
to
the
foresight
of
her
great
statesman
bismarck
and
her
great
general
von
moltke
during
the
same
year
the
italian
army
entered
rome
as
soon
as
the
french
garrison
had
been
withdrawn
and
italy
became
a
united
country
under
king
victor
emmanuel
despite
the
fact
that
the
map
of
europe
was
continually
changing
england
managed
to
keep
clear
of
international
strife
and
this
was
in
no
small
degree
due
to
the
personal
influence
of
the
queen
the
england
of
her
early
years
would
be
an
absolutely
foreign
country
to
us
if
by
some
magic
touch
we
were
to
be
transplanted
back
down
the
line
of
years
it
was
different
in
thought
feeling
and
outlook
the
extraordinary
changes
in
the
modes
of
travelling
by
means
of
which
numbers
of
people
who
had
never
even
thought
of
any
other
country
beside
their
own
were
enabled
to
visit
other
lands
broke
down
bit
by
bit
the
barrier
between
the
continent
and
ourselves
england
became
less
of
an
insular
and
more
of
a
continental
power
the
social
changes
were
as
has
been
shown
all
for
good
education
became
not
the
privilege
of
the
few
but
the
right
of
all
who
wished
for
it
step
by
step
the
people
gained
in
power
and
in
the
right
to
govern
themselves
the
idea
of
citizenship
of
a
patriotism
which
extended
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
these
isles
slowly
took
root
and
blossomed
through
all
these
manifold
changes
the
queen
reigned
ever
alert
and
even
in
her
last
years
taking
the
keenest
interest
in
the
growth
of
her
mighty
kingdom
the
use
of
the
queen
in
a
dignified
capacity
is
incalculable
declared
walter
bagehot
in
his
famous
essay
on
english
he
continues
without
her
in
england
the
present
english
government
would
fail
and
pass
away
it
is
interesting
to
read
the
reasons
which
such
a
clear
and
distinguished
thinker
gives
to
explain
the
hold
which
the
monarchy
retains
upon
the
english
nation
as
a
whole
firstly
there
is
the
family
of
which
the
queen
is
the
head
the
nation
looks
upon
her
as
its
mother
witness
its
enthusiasm
at
the
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
secondly
the
monarchy
strengthens
the
government
with
the
strength
of
religion
it
is
the
duty
of
a
loyal
citizen
to
obey
his
queen
the
oath
of
allegiance
is
no
empty
form
the
queen
from
her
very
position
acts
as
a
symbol
of
unity
thirdly
the
queen
is
the
head
of
our
society
she
represents
england
in
the
eyes
of
foreign
nations
fourthly
the
monarchy
is
the
head
of
our
morality
the
example
of
queen
victoria
simple
life
has
not
been
lost
upon
the
nation
it
is
now
quite
a
natural
thing
to
expect
and
to
find
the
domestic
virtues
personified
in
the
ruling
monarch
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
history
has
shown
what
temptations
lie
in
the
way
of
those
possessed
of
the
highest
power
in
the
state
shakespeare
voiced
the
feeling
of
the
people
for
the
kingship
in
the
words
which
he
put
into
the
mouth
of
henry
v
upon
the
king
let
us
our
lives
our
souls
our
debts
our
careful
wives
our
children
and
our
sins
lay
on
the
king
we
must
bear
all
o
hard
condition
with
greatness
subject
to
the
breath
of
every
fool
whose
sense
no
more
can
feel
but
his
own
wringing
what
infinite
heart
ease
must
kings
neglect
that
private
men
enjoy
and
what
have
kings
that
privates
have
not
too
save
ceremony
save
general
ceremony
and
lastly
the
actual
government
of
the
country
may
change
but
the
monarch
remains
subject
to
no
changes
of
parliament
above
and
aloof
from
the
strife
of
political
parties
the
steadying
influence
in
times
of
transition
the
sovereign
has
three
rights
the
right
to
be
consulted
the
right
to
encourage
the
right
to
warn
a
comparison
of
the
reigns
of
the
four
georges
with
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
shows
that
it
was
only
during
the
latter
reign
that
the
duties
of
the
constitutional
monarch
were
well
and
conscientiously
performed
the
queen
worked
as
well
as
her
ministers
and
was
their
equal
and
often
their
superior
in
business
capacity
to
conclude
the
benefits
of
a
good
monarch
are
almost
invaluable
but
the
evils
of
a
bad
monarch
are
almost
irreparable
on
the
death
of
the
queen
mr
arthur
balfour
speaking
in
the
house
of
commons
described
his
visit
to
osborne
at
a
time
when
the
royal
family
was
already
in
mourning
the
queen
desk
was
still
littered
with
papers
the
inkstand
still
open
and

pen
laid
beside
it
she
passed
away
with
her
children

her
children

the

around
her
beloved
and

of
all
she
passed

without

well

in
the

even
those
who
loved
not
england
loved
her
she
passed

not
only
knowing
that
she
was
i
had
almost
said
worshipped
and
reverenced
by
all
her
subjects
but
that
their
feelings
towards
her
had
grown
in
depth
and
intensity
with
every
